01:40.600 --> 01:42.018
Hey, Dr. Yoon…

01:43.144 --> 01:43.978
What?

01:48.274 --> 01:49.567
Oh, my goodness.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.534
<i>Guess what? I just saw Dr. Yoon
walking out of Chief Hong's house.</i>

01:57.617 --> 02:00.787
<i>Early in the morning,
like a sneaky little cat.</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:03.373
<i>Here I thought Du-sik was a tame one.</i>

02:04.040 --> 02:06.292
<i>There's no more innocence
left in the world.</i>

02:06.376 --> 02:08.169
<i>Nam-suk, stop badmouthing people.</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.761
Ladies, look at this.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.888
-What?
-What is it?

02:31.025 --> 02:32.360
You slept with Chief Hong?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.947
<i>Hye-jin and Du-sik sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

02:36.739 --> 02:37.657
Oh, dear.

02:41.953 --> 02:42.954
What's wrong?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.039
So it's true?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.876
Do we have any hangover tea?

02:47.959 --> 02:48.835
Let me look.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.444
God, my head.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.156
EPISODE 5

03:37.634 --> 03:39.385
She must've left in a hurry.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.807
FOR BROTH, BEAN SPROUTS

03:51.731 --> 03:53.066
All right.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.865
Tofu is a must
for kimchi soup with bean sprouts.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.911
This headache is killing me.

04:05.703 --> 04:08.581
How much did I drink
that I blacked out there?

04:09.540 --> 04:10.625
God, my head.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.380
<i>Du-sik.</i>

04:15.463 --> 04:17.423
<i>I even learned pole dancing.</i>

04:25.056 --> 04:27.016
-<i>Don't I look like Yuna Kim?</i>
-What the…

04:27.100 --> 04:28.476
Oh, my.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.894
<i>Look at this.</i>

04:29.978 --> 04:31.604
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

04:31.688 --> 04:34.148
<i>Look here. One, two, three.</i>

04:36.234 --> 04:37.652
This is nuts.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.114
The combination to my door lock

04:41.197 --> 04:46.369
is eight, seven, zero, seven, two, four.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.747
Chief Hong!

04:54.752 --> 04:55.962
Aren't I so good?

04:56.045 --> 04:57.046
Aren't I strong?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.173
Aren't I really good?

05:00.925 --> 05:02.802
One, two!

05:02.885 --> 05:05.555
Two! Aren't I so good?

05:05.638 --> 05:08.641
<i>One million and twenty-two,
twenty-three, twenty-four.</i>

05:08.725 --> 05:10.101
<i>Chief Hong!</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:14.022
I should quit drinking.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.527
Hold on.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.447
That's odd.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.824
I was out all night,

05:25.366 --> 05:27.994
so how did I end up
back at his house again?

05:31.748 --> 05:32.749
<i>Du-sik.</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:36.586
<i>Chief Hong!</i>

05:38.546 --> 05:41.466
What? Why can't I remember
what happened next?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.763
-Let's go.
-Mi-seon.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.932
-Why don't we take the day off?
-Sure.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.225
-Seriously?
-Yes.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.936
Your credit card bill is on the table.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.605
-This month--
-Don't tell me.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.899
Let's just go to work.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.234
Let's go.

06:02.028 --> 06:02.904
What's wrong?

06:02.987 --> 06:05.406
-This is bad. You should go first.
-What do you mean?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.534
This is going to be
a long battle. Go first.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.088
Darn it.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.466
MARK AND CHECK COUNTRY OF ORIGIN

06:24.550 --> 06:26.052
-Hey!
-Hey!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.721
Hey! They slept together?

06:29.514 --> 06:30.556
Did they?

06:30.640 --> 06:31.724
The two slept together?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.309
Be quiet.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.394
She yawned and took
the sleep out of her eye.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.271
-She looked content.
-It's true.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.856
-Content?
-She did?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.652
-Hello.
-Gosh.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.153
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.072
-Hello.
-Ms. Dentist!

06:46.155 --> 06:47.490
-It's Du-sik.
-Hey.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.242
Gosh.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.828
You left early without doing the dishes.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.995
My gosh.

06:53.079 --> 06:57.166
Well… Don't you think it's rude
to make your guest wash the dishes?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.877
-I even brought expensive wine.
-My phone…

06:59.961 --> 07:02.547
-Did you forget the ginseng wine you had?
-The wi-fi…

07:02.630 --> 07:04.382
We had ginseng wine?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.635
Forget it. Did you eat?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.554
Let's take a photo.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.264
I was going to work.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.808
But how about breakfast?

07:16.727 --> 07:18.521
-What are we having?
-Let's go old-school.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.314
-Okay.
-Look at them together.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.399
What are you doing?

07:21.482 --> 07:22.692
Just taking a photo.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.277
-Du-sik.
-A photo?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.487
You look tired. How wonderful.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.198
Why are you taking photos
and calling out here?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.784
-The connection is best here.
-You look good.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.828
What are you saying? That's absurd.

07:33.911 --> 07:34.912
-Bye, then.
-Gosh.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.789
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.084
They're having hangover soup.

07:40.626 --> 07:41.836
Do you see them?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.883
What are you doing there?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.718
Hey, come take a look.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.760
Hurry.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.888
Come on. This is huge.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.641
-I can't see.
-Let's open it a crack.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.976
Be quiet!

07:57.852 --> 07:58.895
Do you see them?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.438
-Yes.
-What's going on?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.231
-Can you see?
-How pretty.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.695
By old-school, I meant
meat on the bone, not ox blood.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.405
Ox blood is the best.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.282
It's chewy and savory.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.160
It's rich in vitamin A and iron.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.121
-That's not important right now.
-Then what is?

08:17.205 --> 08:20.041
Just eat as casually as possible.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.170
Pick up your spoon
and don't look to your left.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.507
No. I told you not to look.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.263
Gosh. Come on.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.849
I can feel that many people

08:36.933 --> 08:39.101
are watching us. What's going on?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.729
People got wind

08:42.730 --> 08:43.814
of us…

08:47.360 --> 08:48.819
sleeping together last night.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.199
I… I can't see clearly.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.493
So anyway,

08:56.160 --> 08:57.787
did anything happen yesterday?

09:03.626 --> 09:04.710
Something did.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.296
What?

09:08.589 --> 09:09.507
Well…

09:13.219 --> 09:14.512
A lot happened.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.097
You don't get drunk easily?

09:16.639 --> 09:19.183
I thought I was watching a TV show.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.103
You suddenly ran out, sang, and danced.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.438
Hanging from a pole,
"Don't I look like Yuna Kim?"

09:24.522 --> 09:26.399
Then you started running again

09:26.482 --> 09:28.317
and screamed my name.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.278
It was one hell of a spectacle.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.947
That's odd.
I don't have any drinking habits.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.407
Maybe I wasn't feeling well.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.492
So that's normal for you?

09:36.576 --> 09:40.246
Then you threw a tantrum
and insisted we should drink more.

09:40.329 --> 09:44.292
So we came back to my place,
and you drank my homemade wine.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.627
You better pay for the ginseng wine.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.754
I didn't know ox blood was rich in iron.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.089
What?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.883
-It's good.
-Gosh.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.470
Here.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.014
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.348
Did he just touch her?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.142
What are they doing?

10:01.976 --> 10:03.811
Are you a kid? Wipe your mouth.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.813
They'll get the wrong idea!

10:05.896 --> 10:09.692
You scared me. You looked like Joker
with blood on your lips.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.863
You ruined it all.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.823
What did I do?

10:16.907 --> 10:20.036
I was going to kill that rumor
by eating nonchalantly with you,

10:20.119 --> 10:22.121
so why did you have to wipe my mouth?

10:24.290 --> 10:27.752
Now they're going to ramble on
about how great we look together.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.428
Do you sense any chemistry between them?

10:38.095 --> 10:41.932
If I were to compare it
to music, there's no hook.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.143
-It's so bland.
-I agree.

10:44.226 --> 10:48.230
He wiped her mouth
like Geum-cheol would Bo-ra's.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.565
I sensed fatherly love.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.360
-Right?
-Yes. Something like this.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.236
Yes, exactly.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.073
Maybe nothing happened last night.

10:57.156 --> 11:01.160
Come on! They're adults.
I'm sure something happened.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.412
Seriously.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.956
-Gosh.
-That's enough!

11:06.040 --> 11:09.085
So this was what you were doing.
What a waste of energy.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.337
-Don't you know about privacy?
-Not the spelling.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.132
Why would you gossip?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.301
I just stated what I saw.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.011
-She was wrong, right?
-Gosh.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.930
That's just foolish bravery.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.100
Ruining one's reputation with facts
is also defamation, got it?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.394
-Got it?
-Okay, smarty-pants.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.353
Just leave.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.106
Go on, now.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.565
Fine. Let's go.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.151
I should go prepare
some noodles. Let's go.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.240
I have to go receive coffee beans anyway.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.118
I should go back to my store.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.994
Why is he still there?

11:45.830 --> 11:46.956
Come on!

11:48.249 --> 11:50.543
Wait! My legs cramped up!

11:57.049 --> 11:59.176
<i>I made a new chatroom without Hwa-jeong.</i>

11:59.260 --> 12:01.011
<i>Let's talk more at Bora Supermarket.</i>

12:01.720 --> 12:03.597
Chief Hong could do better than Dr. Yoon.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.724
Of course, he could.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.685
You can say that again.

12:07.768 --> 12:11.439
Compared to Chief Hong,
Dr. Yoon is nothing.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.731
People are lined up for Du-sik.

12:13.357 --> 12:16.527
There's nothing Du-sik lacks.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.405
Every single girl in Gongjin
had a crush on him at least once.

12:19.488 --> 12:20.739
Right.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.991
He's also my first love.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.327
-What?
-Did you think it was you?

12:26.620 --> 12:30.124
Gosh, you're all so brazen, aren't you?

12:30.207 --> 12:33.961
How could you think
Du-sik is better than the dentist?

12:34.044 --> 12:36.380
-What?
-What? Are you siding with her?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.257
-So?
-So? What?

12:40.176 --> 12:43.220
So tell me, Chun-jae.
What's your take on this?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.807
Gam-ri. I told you
to call me Oh Yoon, not Chun-jae.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.100
-Gosh.
-Oh Yoon.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.643
-Oh Yoon.
-Right.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.229
Du-sik? He's a wonderful guy.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.606
Right.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.940
But she's not bad either.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.817
You only get one vote.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.278
-Goodness.
-Hello.

13:01.530 --> 13:05.159
So? Is it Hye-jin or Chief Hong?

13:05.242 --> 13:07.912
You see, Chief Hong is good at everything.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.247
-Right. He is.
-There's nothing he can't do.

13:10.331 --> 13:14.376
-Right? But Dr. Yoon is a dentist,
-Right.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.045
so she must make lots of money.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.713
That tips the scale for her side.

13:17.796 --> 13:22.218
While Dr. Yoon can only fix teeth,
Du-sik can fix anything.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.469
You're right.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.471
But he can't fix teeth.

13:25.554 --> 13:26.722
You're spitting everywhere!

13:26.805 --> 13:27.848
Here's my card.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.683
No, it's on me.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.603
No, thanks. I don't let
just any guy pay for my meal.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.731
Good for me, then. Thanks for the meal.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.358
We'd like to pay separately.

13:39.693 --> 13:40.819
That'll be 8,000 won.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.328
Thank you.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.917
Let's stop by Chun-jae's cafe.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.129
I make a mean hangover coffee.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.715
Chief Hong.

14:02.841 --> 14:03.842
Do you like me?

14:03.926 --> 14:06.011
Don't be absurd.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.640
How deluded must you be to misinterpret

14:09.723 --> 14:12.685
an invitation to a cup of coffee
as an "I like you"?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.396
-Do you have Princess Syndrome?
-I just thought…

14:16.438 --> 14:18.065
It wasn't groundless suspicion.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.149
What?

14:19.775 --> 14:22.903
Think about it. You found my shoe for me

14:22.987 --> 14:25.239
and came to my rescue back at the clinic.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.740
You're always around.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.410
I picked up that shoe

14:29.493 --> 14:31.745
so that it wouldn't pollute the ocean.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.623
As for that pervert,
Ms. Gam-ri called me out of the blue…

14:34.707 --> 14:36.584
What? I'm always around you?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.795
It was you who came by last night
and offered to have a meal today.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.505
Forget it, then.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.300
I just wanted to check
to prevent any disasters.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.261
To be frank, we're not a good match.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.308
You and I have different social positions.

14:53.017 --> 14:53.893
Social positions?

14:53.976 --> 14:57.354
You know the more similar backgrounds,
the better people get along, right?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.482
Since they have
similar values and lifestyles,

15:01.150 --> 15:03.569
they'll clash less.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.030
But we're…

15:08.365 --> 15:10.951
I wasn't trying to judge you.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.453
I just wanted to clear up--

15:12.536 --> 15:14.997
I pity myself, but I pity you too.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.666
-What do you mean?
-Don't be so calculating.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.335
Isn't it tiring?

15:35.559 --> 15:37.311
Was I too harsh on him?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.357
Don't you agree with me, though?

15:41.857 --> 15:45.277
Objectively speaking,
I'm too good for Chief Hong.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.697
I was tired,
but this helped clear my head.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.284
Everyone says you're the lucky one.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.204
I can't believe them.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.707
I get that he's from Gongjin too,
but that's just not right.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.710
I'm a doctor.
I graduated dentistry school.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.170
Chief Hong is from
Seoul National University.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.421
From what?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.090
Seoul National University.

16:07.257 --> 16:09.176
-Don't lie.
-It's the truth.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.389
He didn't just go to any school in Seoul,

16:14.014 --> 16:15.766
-but Seoul National University?
-Yes.

16:17.184 --> 16:21.063
If you think about it, he's been
extraordinary ever since he was little.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.398
-Right.
-Right.

16:22.940 --> 16:27.695
<i>-Sky is black, earth is yellow
-He was always smart since he was little.</i>

16:27.778 --> 16:32.324
<i>-Space and time, vast and limitless
-At age six, he memorized the </i>Cheonjamun<i>.</i>

16:32.408 --> 16:36.662
<i>-Sun, high or low, Moon, full or parsed
-I've never seen anyone like him.</i>

16:36.745 --> 16:38.580
<i>Even with all that playing,</i>

16:38.664 --> 16:42.251
<i>whenever he took a test,
he would always get first place.</i>

16:42.334 --> 16:45.587
<i>He even won gold medal
at the Mathematics Olympiad.</i>

16:45.671 --> 16:48.799
<i>That's not all.
He was a great fighter too.</i>

16:48.882 --> 16:50.884
<i>No one in Gongjin
could hold a candle to him.</i>

17:02.104 --> 17:03.272
<i>He did fight well,</i>

17:03.939 --> 17:06.066
<i>but that's not something to brag about.</i>

17:06.150 --> 17:09.403
<i>He fought to save you
from getting beaten up.</i>

17:10.154 --> 17:14.241
You see, I've always been
a pacifist against violence.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.493
Goodness. That's embarrassing.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.163
But he eventually got into SNU
to study engineering.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.206
-With the highest grades at that.
-Right.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.167
We called him the pride of Gongjin

17:23.250 --> 17:25.794
and even put up banners.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.920
-Right.
-Didn't he

17:27.004 --> 17:28.756
also get a scholarship every year?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.049
-Right.
-Yes.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.383
We sure are proud of him.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.053
Then why does he live the way he does?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.097
They may address him as Chief Hong,

17:37.181 --> 17:38.599
but he's just a part-timer.

17:38.682 --> 17:43.020
You see,
there are three mysteries in Gongjin.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.147
-That's so random.
-Listen up.

17:45.814 --> 17:50.027
Number one. The real reason
why Ms. Yeo and Mr. Chang divorced.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.988
Right. No one seems to know.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.366
Number two.
Chief Hong's whereabouts for five years.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.578
His whereabouts for five years?

17:59.661 --> 18:02.456
He returned to Gongjin
five years after graduating,

18:02.539 --> 18:05.292
yet no one knows
what he did during those years.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.668
There are only rumors.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.295
REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT OF BAEKDU

18:09.671 --> 18:13.300
<i>I heard that he was sent
to North Korea as a spy.</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:22.976
<i>You're wrong.</i>

18:23.060 --> 18:24.978
<i>It makes more sense that he worked</i>

18:25.062 --> 18:28.607
<i>for the National Intelligence Service
and had to fake his identity.</i>

18:32.236 --> 18:34.321
Wasn't there a rumor
that he took care of lions

18:34.404 --> 18:36.907
while working
for an animal rights group in Africa?

18:37.658 --> 18:40.744
There was also a rumor
that he swam across the Pacific.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.455
You're wrong. It was the mountain.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.125
He climbed Mount Everest
without an oxygen tank.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.338
You all talk about him
in a positive light.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.259
You know there are other rumors.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.104
<i>Some say he was locked
in a mental asylum for all those years.</i>

19:07.813 --> 19:10.691
<i>Others say he was incarcerated for murder.</i>

19:10.774 --> 19:12.943
Why does my ear itch so much?

19:13.026 --> 19:15.070
-Gosh.
-That's ridiculous.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.364
-How absurd. He's not that type.
-Gosh.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.659
You lunatic.
You just have no filter, do you?

19:20.742 --> 19:23.579
Aren't you his friend?
How could you believe those rumors?

19:23.662 --> 19:26.623
-I need a lock.
-Why?

19:26.707 --> 19:29.334
I ought to lock his lips with it.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.752
-Yes, do that.
-Honey, please.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.546
Can you please be quiet?

19:32.629 --> 19:35.757
-What? I just heard those rumors.
-Be quiet!

19:35.841 --> 19:37.467
You always bash me! Damn it!

19:37.551 --> 19:39.678
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.805
-Where's he going?
-Who cares.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.640
-I feel bad for you.
-What's his deal?

19:44.224 --> 19:47.811
Hey. Where did you hear all that?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.980
The Gongjin Friends chat room.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.816
Why did they invite you and not me?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.818
Beats me. They just invited me.

19:56.111 --> 20:00.199
So? Who do you think is better off?
Chief Hong or me?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.285
We're expecting a patient soon.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.954
Darn it. Are we really friends?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.832
Do you really think he's better than me?

20:08.916 --> 20:12.044
Hey. Love shouldn't be
about weighing things.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.922
It's all about what's in your heart.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.966
That's rich coming from someone
who only cares about the looks.

20:18.050 --> 20:22.262
You're the one who fell in love
with Choi Eun-cheol at first sight.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.140
That's right. I'm simple like that.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.558
But what about you?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.603
You consider their looks, height,
educational background, and job.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.648
I'm just filtering as much as I can
since I can't date them all.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.609
So? How did that work out for you?

20:35.692 --> 20:39.363
Did you not learn anything
after what Lee Gang-uk did to you?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.494
Hye-jin.

20:46.870 --> 20:50.040
Would you like to know
what the third mystery is?

20:50.123 --> 20:51.625
I'm going to the restroom.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.051
Me and my big mouth.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.122
Gang-uk, your taste
in women changed a lot!

21:30.205 --> 21:31.415
Shut up, you bastard.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.418
She isn't bad for a dental student.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.379
She has a nice body
but terrible fashion sense.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.589
I feel embarrassed whenever we go out.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.217
I thought she'd
get dolled up today, but no.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.386
I almost told her to go home earlier.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.180
But I like how she looks simple.

21:47.264 --> 21:50.684
There's a very fine line
between looking simple and poor.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.312
She only has
a few pieces of clothes and shoes.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.105
She looks pathetic.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.940
Let's just drink.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.150
Damn it.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.284
Please tell them I left
because something urgent came up.

23:01.004 --> 23:04.925
You stayed in touch with Chief Hong
while he was in Seoul, didn't you?

23:05.008 --> 23:06.593
Don't you know what he was up to?

23:06.676 --> 23:08.386
What does it matter?

23:08.470 --> 23:11.181
What's important is
that he's with us right now.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.476
But still, I can't help but feel curious.

23:14.559 --> 23:18.605
It did seem a bit odd
when he returned. Don't you agree?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.273
I don't want to hear it.

23:20.357 --> 23:24.236
Enough with your rambling.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.782
Look at all these beautiful flowers.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.825
Right.

23:31.284 --> 23:35.122
Isn't this great? I'm glad
we planted so many flowers.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.835
It's so strange. When I was young,
I didn't care to appreciate them.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.963
That's because
we were the flowers back then.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.173
Yes. You're right.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.136
Since they're already in full bloom,

23:49.219 --> 23:52.305
the only thing left
is to wither away graciously.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.267
Look over here!

23:55.934 --> 23:56.977
What?

24:00.021 --> 24:03.525
What? Why'd you take a photo of us?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.820
Take photos of these flowers,

24:06.903 --> 24:08.989
not of old women like us.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.950
-I don't even have makeup on.
-Exactly.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.077
Don't worry.
You're prettier than the flowers.

24:14.161 --> 24:18.540
You and your sugarcoated words.
We know you don't mean that.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.919
Though I'm in my 70s,
it still feels great to hear I'm pretty.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.213
-Don't you guys agree with me?
-What?

24:35.140 --> 24:36.349
That sounds great.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.394
Is this a <i>nanta</i> performance or what?

24:39.477 --> 24:41.438
-Don't I have a good rhythm?
-You do.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.565
This is proof that I'm indeed a musician.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.028
Stop eating our snacks and go work.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.948
-Hwa-jeong.
-What?

24:52.657 --> 24:53.658
What will you do

24:54.659 --> 24:56.244
about Ms. Yu Cho-hui?

24:57.204 --> 25:01.291
So that's why you're here.
Am I your next gossiping victim?

25:01.374 --> 25:04.961
Yu Cho-hui? Why does it sound familiar?
I heard that name before.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.965
She's Yeong-guk's first love.
The teacher who taught here 15 years ago.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.718
Yes! I remember!

25:11.801 --> 25:13.428
He fell head over heels in love

25:13.511 --> 25:15.972
-with her.
-Exactly. You remember her, right?

25:16.056 --> 25:17.265
She's back.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.975
-Seriously?
-Yes.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.853
I looked into her, and she's still single.

25:21.937 --> 25:25.106
No way. Yeong-guk
must be on cloud nine then.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.149
And you know,

25:26.233 --> 25:28.860
she's much prettier than her.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.988
Right. Hwa-jeong, she was pretty.
She was definitely pretty.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.035
She's so strong.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.788
-She popped the head.
-Goodness.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.039
That's enough.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.583
He's not my husband anymore.
Why talk to me about her?

25:43.667 --> 25:46.670
I'm just worried about you. That's all.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.004
Why is that?

25:48.088 --> 25:51.132
Although you're divorced,
Yeong-guk <i>oppa</i> must still bother you.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.926
-Yeong-guk <i>oppa</i>?
-Yes.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.971
-Yeong-guk <i>oppa</i>.
-That's understandable.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.723
You treat me like we're the same age,

25:58.807 --> 26:00.558
but why treat him like he's older?

26:00.642 --> 26:02.394
He and I are the same age, you know?

26:02.477 --> 26:05.146
Only your birth year matters
once you become an adult.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.773
Then I'm older than you!

26:07.399 --> 26:09.734
Gosh, you and I were in the same grade,

26:09.818 --> 26:11.611
but not him.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.696
That's enough.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.322
She'll kill you.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.659
Gosh.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.079
Do you want me to treat you
like you're older?

26:23.039 --> 26:25.083
I'll do that. Let me do this for you.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.419
-But you look older.
-Shut up.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.796
-Hwa-jeong, you look young.
-You do.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.720
Cho-hui.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.724
Would you like to walk on the beach…

26:43.184 --> 26:44.936
Gosh, that's too old-fashioned.

26:48.398 --> 26:52.360
Cho-hui, you like coffee, don't you?

26:53.194 --> 26:56.990
Would you like to have
a cup of iced Americano… No.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.868
A cup of I.A. with me?

27:00.785 --> 27:02.120
This is driving me crazy.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.749
Just send it to her!
You're so frustrating to watch.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.001
How much did you read?

27:09.002 --> 27:11.671
A drive, a movie,
a walk, and a cup of coffee?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.131
That's a lot of dates.

27:13.923 --> 27:16.468
I'm going to file a complaint about you,

27:16.551 --> 27:18.470
a civil servant, slacking off at work.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.930
Texting her isn't something
to be ashamed of.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.558
You've been divorced
for three whole years.

27:24.768 --> 27:25.935
You're right.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.230
What's stopping you?
You're reunited with your first love.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.691
And both of you happen to be single.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.693
Isn't this fate?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.321
It's the perfect time to ask her out.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.657
Send her the text and come in.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.580
Exactly.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.750
Why now, and not back then?

29:28.808 --> 29:32.145
Thank you. You saved my life.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.023
No, I saved your camera's life.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.568
A person can be rescued and dried,
but a camera dies right away.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.696
Shock-proof doesn't mean waterproof.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.407
You know your way around cameras.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.367
What? Wait.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.914
This was the last model…
I hear it's really rare.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.208
The lens was harder to get.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.377
Only 500 of them were produced worldwide.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.505
Let's keep some distance from each other.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.299
Sure. How did you find such a rare item?

30:01.382 --> 30:03.426
It was a lot of legwork.
It took a few years.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.304
Will you sell it to me?
Please do. I'll pay you twice as much.

30:06.387 --> 30:10.767
Gosh, is it a trend nowadays to be brazen
and demand more from your lifesaver?

30:10.850 --> 30:12.101
Would you sell it?

30:12.185 --> 30:16.397
Well… Then can I touch it for a moment?

30:16.981 --> 30:20.026
Let me just hold it. You can hold mine.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.861
-Deal?
-Deal.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.326
This looks sturdy.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.746
Did the camera and the lens
cost about 20 million won?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.373
It was a bit over that.

30:34.123 --> 30:37.919
I believe this was made in 1957.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.420
You took great care of it.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.006
Judging by the price,
I doubt this is just a hobby.

30:42.924 --> 30:43.842
Is this your job?

30:44.551 --> 30:46.427
Well, yes. I guess you can say that.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.054
What do you mean?

30:48.137 --> 30:50.473
I take photos and videos.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.643
Are you here on a location shoot?

30:54.310 --> 30:56.479
I'm not sure
the neighborhood counts as that.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.731
I see. You live nearby.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.943
Then do you know
how to get to the observatory?

31:04.320 --> 31:05.572
Look.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.491
Take a left in front of that forked road.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.202
Walk 30m, and you'll see a barbershop.

31:11.286 --> 31:15.290
Take a left, and you'll see a set
of stairs that lead to the mountains.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.667
Just go straight. Simple, right?

31:17.750 --> 31:20.336
Yes. Thank you for everything today.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.089
We should always lend a hand
to others. Have a safe trip.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.049
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

31:36.185 --> 31:40.273
Hey! Take a left, not a right! Take…

31:44.277 --> 31:45.278
Darn it.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.324
Hey!

31:50.158 --> 31:50.992
Hey!

31:53.077 --> 31:55.330
Why am I here?

31:56.831 --> 31:59.292
This is a killer view.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.711
The breeze is so refreshing too.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.672
You're such a happy-go-lucky guy.
First time in Gongjin?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.967
No. This is already
my fourth time here this year.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.094
Did you hide treasure here? Why so often?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.555
Gongjin wasn't my original destination,

32:12.639 --> 32:14.974
but I lost my way.

32:15.058 --> 32:19.145
Gosh. Have you ever thought
about using recent technology?

32:19.228 --> 32:21.439
There's GPS or online maps.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.858
Even they couldn't be of help.

32:25.109 --> 32:29.113
But because of that, I stumbled
across this great place, Gongjin.

32:31.324 --> 32:34.118
You're an optimist
with a bad sense of direction.

32:34.202 --> 32:37.205
It's okay to get lost
or take the long route every now and then.

32:37.288 --> 32:41.459
Every time that happened,
life took me on an interesting ride.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.090
I hope self-driving cars will
be available soon.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.718
It worries me.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.265
People like you really need those things.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.395
I'm hungry.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.439
Just enjoy the view.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.405
Why do you look so glum?

33:11.364 --> 33:13.324
Embarrassed about mentioning

33:13.408 --> 33:15.827
social positions to a guy
from a prestigious school?

33:16.703 --> 33:18.037
That wasn't why.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.373
But thanks for reminding me.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.544
There's something
I'm really curious about.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.922
Did you really not sleep with him?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.173
Hey.

33:30.633 --> 33:31.551
But then again,

33:31.634 --> 33:35.096
a conservative girl like you
would never give in to your desires.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.310
I think I blacked out yesterday.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.855
-Completely?
-Not completely,

33:44.522 --> 33:46.274
but I only remember bits and pieces.

33:47.066 --> 33:48.609
I hung on a streetlamp

33:49.277 --> 33:50.945
and laughed like a lunatic.

33:51.904 --> 33:53.072
What should I do?

33:53.156 --> 33:55.033
You don't need to tell me.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.076
Stop thinking and forget about it.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.122
Do you know why
it's so painful after blacking out?

34:01.789 --> 34:05.043
It's because you try so hard
to remember everything.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.253
What's done is done. Just press delete,

34:07.336 --> 34:09.422
forget about everything, and feel at ease.

34:10.381 --> 34:12.300
-Should I do that?
-Yes.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.098
But when you blacked out,

34:19.182 --> 34:20.641
did it become rated R?

34:20.725 --> 34:21.893
Hey!

34:23.311 --> 34:24.479
Hello.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.897
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.523
Don't you live next door?

34:27.607 --> 34:28.858
Yes.

34:28.941 --> 34:31.527
I moved in a few days ago,
and I finally get to greet you.

34:31.611 --> 34:32.987
My name is Yu Cho-hui.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.073
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Hye-jin.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.327
We work at Yoon Dental Clinic over there.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.788
Stop by if your teeth ever ache.

34:41.871 --> 34:45.458
Goodness. Are you the doctor
who'll be visiting the school tomorrow?

34:47.168 --> 34:49.212
Yes. I am.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.672
I teach at Cheongjin Elementary School.

34:51.756 --> 34:52.924
What a small world.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.467
I see.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.426
I hope we get along.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.137
Right. I hope we get along as well.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.639
All right.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.308
Hwajeong Raw Fish Restaurant?

35:03.351 --> 35:04.560
All right.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.771
Where should we sit?

35:06.854 --> 35:08.731
You can sit by the window.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.150
Are you sure this place sells tasty food?

35:11.234 --> 35:13.236
Come on. I'm telling you.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.905
All right. Pick what you want.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.281
Sit down and pick with me.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.367
No, I should take your order.

35:20.034 --> 35:20.868
Sorry?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.745
Is this your restaurant?

35:22.829 --> 35:26.666
No, it's not. But since I'm here,
I might as well help out.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.001
Can I just give you what I want?

35:29.085 --> 35:31.129
-Sorry?
-I'll be back soon.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.589
Wait… But…

35:34.882 --> 35:37.510
That's some smooth touting.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.097
Gosh.

35:47.854 --> 35:53.442
Goodness, what big portions.
And these are some special mussels.

35:53.526 --> 35:56.362
Most people from Seoul
think they're just regular mussels.

35:56.445 --> 35:59.657
You see, I'm quite the gourmet.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.284
I see.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.206
How is this so soft?

36:07.290 --> 36:09.417
Well, it's because they were fished.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.962
Those caught in traps
harden due to stress.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.884
-I want to introduce this on my show.
-Your show?

36:18.467 --> 36:20.761
I get it. You did mention
that you took videos.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.096
Actually, I'm…

36:22.180 --> 36:24.056
-You must be a <i>mukbang </i>Youtuber.
-What?

36:24.140 --> 36:26.142
If I'd known, I would've given you more.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.143
No, I'm actually--

36:27.226 --> 36:29.896
You have to work harder.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.606
I watch a lot of <i>mukbang</i> shows,

36:32.148 --> 36:34.108
but you don't look familiar.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.359
-Really?
-Yes.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.404
If you want to survive in that field,
you should stand out.

36:38.487 --> 36:39.780
Go safe and you'll flop.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.908
I do hear that often.

36:41.991 --> 36:45.036
They say my shows are always the same
and want something new.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.913
Of course. It's all about variety.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.457
Come up with something new, okay?

36:49.540 --> 36:50.833
I made this. Eat up.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.048
That hit home.

36:58.257 --> 36:59.258
Whatever.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.977
You're so good at calligraphy.

37:10.853 --> 37:11.938
What are you writing?

37:16.859 --> 37:18.736
<i>Hoe-ja-jeong-ri, Geo-ja-pil-ban.</i>

37:19.528 --> 37:21.781
"Those who meet must part,

37:21.864 --> 37:24.242
and those who leave must return."

37:25.952 --> 37:26.911
That's true.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.374
I should check your school notice.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.669
Do you have any homework?

37:35.336 --> 37:36.462
No, I don't.

37:37.463 --> 37:40.591
Dr. Yoon will be teaching you
how to prevent cavities tomorrow.

37:40.675 --> 37:44.845
Right. Don't you have
a new homeroom teacher?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.014
How is she?

37:47.598 --> 37:50.226
I like her. She's pretty and kind.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.604
Really? What's her name?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.691
Yu Cho-hui.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.443
Ms. Yu Cho-hui.

38:09.495 --> 38:13.916
HOE-JA-JEONG-RI
GEO-JA-PIL-BAN

38:16.335 --> 38:17.378
STUDENT INFORMATION

38:17.461 --> 38:19.755
CHANG I-JUN

38:24.260 --> 38:26.262
FATHER: CHANG YEONG-GUK
MOTHER: YEO HWA-JEONG

38:29.890 --> 38:32.685
NEW MESSAGE

38:36.564 --> 38:39.608
<i>Cho-hui, this is Yeong-guk.</i>

38:39.692 --> 38:42.486
<i>Are you free this weekend?</i>

38:43.029 --> 38:45.072
<i>Would you like to have dinner together?</i>

38:50.077 --> 38:52.163
So? How do you like the food?

38:52.246 --> 38:55.333
Overall, it's not bad.
The seasoning isn't bad either.

38:55.416 --> 38:58.252
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

38:58.836 --> 39:04.216
Right. Pardon my cold review.
It's because my work is related to food.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.886
-It's good.
-I see.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.388
How's the large halibut?
It was freshly caught at sea.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.765
To be frank,

39:11.557 --> 39:14.143
that dish disappointed me the most.

39:14.810 --> 39:15.644
It did?

39:15.728 --> 39:18.689
It's the breeding season
for halibut, so they're not as tasty.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.610
And large-sized fish
are best eaten fermented than freshly raw.

39:22.693 --> 39:26.197
Hold up. I agree with the former
since that's the law of nature,

39:26.280 --> 39:27.698
but not the latter.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.785
If you want to enjoy the freshness,
you should have it right away.

39:30.868 --> 39:34.705
Hold on. I think you have
a misconception about fermenting.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.458
Eating it raw means
you're having it right away.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.502
If you slice it,
wrap it in a plastic wrap,

39:39.585 --> 39:42.380
and put it in the fridge for 5 to 6 hours.
That's fermenting.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.839
They're both fresh.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.008
Then why would you refrigerate it?

39:46.092 --> 39:47.843
That's the beauty of waiting.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.845
-Unbelievable.
-It'll improve

39:49.929 --> 39:51.013
the texture and taste.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.265
That's enough. None of that is true.

39:53.849 --> 39:57.061
I was born and raised by the seaside.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.230
I had more fish
in my lifetime than you did.

39:59.313 --> 40:01.315
You just ate them
because they were around,

40:01.399 --> 40:04.193
but I searched far and wide
for good quality raw fish.

40:06.028 --> 40:07.696
Then how about this?

40:07.780 --> 40:09.824
Let's call and ask Baek Jong-won.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.950
-Baek Jong-won?
-Yes.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.744
You know him?

40:13.828 --> 40:16.747
Yes. And very well, at that. Here.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.124
BAEK JONG-WON

40:20.918 --> 40:24.004
<i>The person you have called is unavailable.</i>

40:24.088 --> 40:26.424
<i>-Please try your call again later.</i>
-Why isn't he picking up?

40:26.507 --> 40:28.217
Maybe he blocked your number.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.261
I didn't take you for a liar.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.389
I'm not. He helped me out a lot.
I know him very well.

40:33.472 --> 40:36.851
I do too. I could say hi in person
since I saw him on TV all the time.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.270
-That's not it.
-That's enough. Forget it.

40:39.353 --> 40:42.648
We may not have fermented fish,
but we do have fermented <i>sikhye</i>.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.607
I'll bring some.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.526
He must be a fraud.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.195
Gosh, I…

40:48.779 --> 40:50.865
I feel wrongfully accused.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.451
Why isn't he picking up?

40:54.034 --> 40:55.161
<i>The phone has been turned off.</i>

40:55.244 --> 40:57.913
<i>-You will be forwarded to voicemail.</i>
-Did he really block me?

41:01.792 --> 41:07.131
<i>Now, we will rest our body and soul.</i>

41:07.214 --> 41:11.510
<i>Put down everything
that has happened today.</i>

41:14.513 --> 41:17.516
<i>Chief Hong. Do you like me?</i>

41:18.100 --> 41:20.311
Don't be absurd.

41:22.438 --> 41:27.443
<i>Keep your mind focused
and relax your body.</i>

41:31.697 --> 41:34.450
<i>You and I have different social positions.</i>

41:34.533 --> 41:37.244
I'm a doctor.
I graduated from dental school.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.079
Chief Hong is from
Seoul National University.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.960
<i>Breathe normally.</i>

41:45.544 --> 41:49.632
<i>Inhale and exhale.</i>

41:54.094 --> 41:56.972
I pity myself, but I pity you too.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.767
Don't be so calculating. Isn't it tiring?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.336
Mi-seon, what are you doing?

42:28.128 --> 42:29.004
Constipated again?

42:29.088 --> 42:31.382
No, it's actually the opposite.

42:31.465 --> 42:34.218
I'm a bit busy
going through both extremes.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.845
-What did you have last night?
-Beer.

42:36.929 --> 42:40.474
I was told to stay away from alcohol
due to the nature of my constitution.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.685
You're ridiculous.

42:42.768 --> 42:46.897
Hey, I'm sorry,
but you should go alone. I'm done for.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.315
Are you serious?

42:48.399 --> 42:51.402
How am I supposed to teach
for an hour without an assistant?

42:51.986 --> 42:54.488
I've already found a substitute.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.447
Who?

42:56.240 --> 42:57.491
You'll see.

43:05.583 --> 43:09.295
CHEONGJIN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

43:10.921 --> 43:12.756
Ms. Dentist, over here.

43:14.466 --> 43:17.511
Darn it. Mi-seon, you're dead meat.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.439
Hey, Cho-hui.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.399
Hey, Yeong-guk.

43:31.066 --> 43:34.778
I actually texted you last night.

43:34.862 --> 43:39.283
I know. But it was quite late
at night, so I didn't reply.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.659
I see.

43:41.619 --> 43:46.582
Feel free to text me
whenever you want. You can do that.

43:50.711 --> 43:55.549
I'm here to sit in
on the cavity prevention class

43:56.050 --> 43:58.344
since our town is hosting the program.

43:58.427 --> 43:59.803
Really?

43:59.887 --> 44:01.930
And you see,

44:02.681 --> 44:05.434
-I have a son.
-Dad!

44:05.517 --> 44:08.646
Hey! Come here. Goodness.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.107
What is it?

44:17.237 --> 44:18.072
Honey.

44:19.823 --> 44:23.077
Mom, Dad. This is my homeroom teacher.

44:23.160 --> 44:23.994
What?

44:24.953 --> 44:26.872
Ms. Yu, my mom and dad.

44:26.955 --> 44:29.166
Hello, I'm I-jun's mother.

44:29.249 --> 44:30.918
Hello.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.088
I'm Yu Cho-hui, his new homeroom teacher.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.558
Hwa-jeong.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.061
Goodness. Is she out?

44:49.144 --> 44:52.314
Yes. Ms. Yeo is at I-jun's school.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.857
Why?

44:53.941 --> 44:57.528
She went to sit in on some special class
for kids on behalf of the parents.

44:58.737 --> 45:02.366
Oh, dear. Has the war finally begun?

45:06.620 --> 45:10.666
Sorry. I was walking too close
to a conservative girl like you, wasn't I?

45:11.250 --> 45:12.167
Don't be ridiculous.

45:12.251 --> 45:16.713
I just don't want my thoughtless actions
to cause any more misunderstanding,

45:17.840 --> 45:19.425
such as you thinking I like you.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.218
That's enough.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.804
We sure live in a heartless world,

45:23.887 --> 45:26.932
seeing how my small act of kindness
was misconstrued as interest.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.100
I said stop.

45:28.183 --> 45:31.353
Let me make this clear.
I didn't come here because I missed you.

45:31.437 --> 45:34.648
I just accepted a part-time job.
That's all.

45:35.607 --> 45:39.069
Gosh, you're teasing me
an awful lot for one small mistake.

45:40.154 --> 45:44.533
That's right. I'm planning
to keep this up for a while.

45:45.784 --> 45:48.996
By the way,
are you sure you can assist me properly?

45:50.998 --> 45:53.542
Don't tell me
you even have a dental certificate.

45:53.625 --> 45:54.918
Hurry up.

45:58.505 --> 46:02.551
<i>-I went to the dentist after eating
-I went to the dentist after eating</i>

46:03.093 --> 46:04.803
<i>-A ton of candy
-A ton of candy</i>

46:05.804 --> 46:09.516
<i>-I was scared
-I was scared</i>

46:09.600 --> 46:11.351
<i>-I cried

46:11.435 --> 46:13.395
<i>Even a certificate in recreation?</i>

46:13.479 --> 46:16.732
<i>-But I'm a brave kid
-But I'm a brave kid</i>

46:16.815 --> 46:20.277
<i>-So I got my teeth fixed

46:20.903 --> 46:24.406

46:24.490 --> 46:28.076

46:31.914 --> 46:34.666
<i>-Three times a day

46:34.750 --> 46:37.461
Once again. "My teeth hurt so much."

46:37.544 --> 46:41.256
<i>-Ouch, my teeth hurt
-Ouch, my teeth hurt</i>

46:41.340 --> 46:45.177
<i>-I went to the dentist after eating
-I went to the dentist after eating</i>

46:45.719 --> 46:47.262
<i>-A ton of candy
-A ton of candy</i>

46:48.680 --> 46:52.392
Guys, how do we get cavities?

46:53.519 --> 46:55.270
Yes, I-jun?

46:55.354 --> 46:59.608
The bacteria in your mouth
break down sugar or starch,

46:59.691 --> 47:02.986
convert it into acid,
and erode your teeth.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.739
Correct. Applaud.

47:07.699 --> 47:08.742
Applause.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.458
Now, let's learn how to brush our teeth.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.001
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

47:18.085 --> 47:19.711
How do you brush your teeth?

47:19.795 --> 47:25.300
I slowly brush my teeth
up and down and on both sides like this.

47:25.384 --> 47:29.137
Well… Wait. You shouldn't do it that way.

47:32.808 --> 47:34.393
You should never do what he does.

47:34.476 --> 47:37.312
Watch. Hold the toothbrush like so.

47:37.396 --> 47:39.773
Imagine vibrating it.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.150
-Brush gently.
-Like this?

47:42.234 --> 47:43.277
-Right.
-Gently.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.404
-This is how you do it.
-All right.

47:45.487 --> 47:47.447
-Okay!
-Okay!

47:47.531 --> 47:50.659
That'll be the end. Now, questions.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.202
Any questions?

47:52.286 --> 47:54.246
-Are you guys dating?
-What?

47:54.329 --> 47:55.247
Did you kiss?

47:55.330 --> 47:58.500
Kids, don't put her on the spot like that.

47:58.584 --> 47:59.751
Are you getting married?

47:59.835 --> 48:01.920
-Why do you like him?
-Are you in love?

48:04.590 --> 48:07.843
Listen. I'll only answer
teeth-related questions.

48:07.926 --> 48:11.054
Guys, my parents told me

48:11.138 --> 48:13.640
that two nights ago,

48:14.224 --> 48:17.185
Dr. Yoon and Chief Hong…

48:19.187 --> 48:20.439
What was that for?

48:20.981 --> 48:23.191
Stop putting her in an awkward position.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.955
Where should we put these chairs?

48:37.039 --> 48:38.874
Don't worry. I'll put them away.

48:38.957 --> 48:41.418
Gosh, how will you carry such heavy…

48:43.879 --> 48:45.839
It'll be too heavy for you. Let me.

48:45.922 --> 48:48.008
-But…
-Unbelievable.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.595
He never lifted a finger at home.

48:51.678 --> 48:53.555
What is he trying to prove?

48:54.097 --> 48:57.559
Come on, now.
I'm not trying to prove anything.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.811
Ms. Yeo, shouldn't you leave?

48:59.895 --> 49:02.689
What? Is that what you want?

49:03.357 --> 49:06.234
When did I ever say that?

49:06.318 --> 49:07.527
It was just a question.

49:07.611 --> 49:11.740
I-jun's homeroom teacher
is my new next-door neighbor.

49:12.366 --> 49:16.370
And I sense
a love triangle among those three.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.498
It could even be produced into a movie.

49:19.581 --> 49:22.501
Ms. Yeo. I mean, Hwa-jeong.

49:22.584 --> 49:26.672
If you're free this weekend,
let's have a meal together.

49:26.755 --> 49:28.048
What?

49:28.131 --> 49:31.009
Wait. You're eating with her, not with me?

49:31.093 --> 49:32.386
You're invited too.

49:33.011 --> 49:34.596
Let's all have a meal together.

49:36.723 --> 49:39.309
But aren't you busy this weekend?

49:39.393 --> 49:41.603
No, I have time.

49:44.523 --> 49:45.899
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

49:45.982 --> 49:47.693
Are you not feeling well?

49:47.776 --> 49:49.861
Ms. Yeo, what's going on? Are you in pain?

49:50.737 --> 49:51.947
Gosh.

49:52.030 --> 49:53.865
Do you have a toothache?

49:53.949 --> 49:55.659
I think so.

49:55.742 --> 49:57.077
Oh, dear.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.954
Where's the nurse's office?

49:59.037 --> 50:00.706
Yes. This way.

50:00.789 --> 50:01.915
Walk slowly.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.167
-Goodness.
-Is it very painful?

50:05.001 --> 50:06.837
-Does this one hurt?
-No.

50:07.587 --> 50:10.257
-What about this one?
-It's fine.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.258
Really?

50:11.925 --> 50:14.678
-How about--
-That hurts.

50:14.761 --> 50:16.513
-It does?
-Yes.

50:17.013 --> 50:18.598
-How about here?
-There too.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.517
It hurts a lot.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.518
I see.

50:22.060 --> 50:25.814
Do you have a habit
of clenching your teeth?

50:25.897 --> 50:28.942
I think so. I clench them in my sleep too.

50:29.025 --> 50:31.778
I think it's myofascial pain syndrome.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.113
Myofascial pain syndrome?

50:33.196 --> 50:36.241
Yes. All the nerves close to your face

50:36.324 --> 50:38.869
may make you mistake
pain caused around your head

50:38.952 --> 50:41.455
for that in your molars.

50:41.538 --> 50:42.664
Then what should I do?

50:42.748 --> 50:47.085
Ice and heat the area alternately
for today and come to the clinic tomorrow.

50:47.169 --> 50:50.172
If you're in too much pain,
you can take painkillers.

50:50.255 --> 50:51.757
Thank you, Dr. Yoon.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.509
The pain went on for a while,
so I thought I had cavities.

50:54.593 --> 50:57.596
Most people automatically think
toothaches stem from the teeth.

50:57.679 --> 50:59.264
But at times, that's not the case.

51:00.223 --> 51:02.142
So it's important to find out

51:02.225 --> 51:04.352
where the pain is coming from.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.605
That way, you can receive
proper treatment.

51:08.815 --> 51:09.649
Right.

51:13.153 --> 51:16.448
Ma'am, I need anti-diarrheal medicine.

51:16.531 --> 51:18.074
One minute.

51:24.581 --> 51:26.041
Ms. Pyo.

51:26.124 --> 51:29.544
Hello, what brings you here?

51:29.628 --> 51:32.339
To get some dental floss.
You told me to floss every day.

51:32.422 --> 51:33.882
Right, I did.

51:33.965 --> 51:35.425
Are you feeling unwell?

51:35.509 --> 51:39.346
Well, I have a slight headache.

51:39.429 --> 51:41.807
Ma'am, did you say
anti-diarrheal medicine?

51:41.890 --> 51:44.726
Is it serious? Watery?

51:48.980 --> 51:50.607
Ms. Pyo.

51:50.690 --> 51:51.817
Ms. Pyo!

51:53.735 --> 51:57.113
If it's not that bad,
I advise you not to take the medicine.

51:57.781 --> 52:00.951
Drink a lot of lukewarm water.
Sports drinks are good too.

52:01.034 --> 52:02.744
It's better to let it flow out

52:02.828 --> 52:04.996
than to force it to stop.

52:06.289 --> 52:09.709
How can you talk about it
as if it's nothing?

52:09.793 --> 52:12.796
Because I went through it as well.
It's nothing embarrassing.

52:14.089 --> 52:15.382
Are you always this kind?

52:15.966 --> 52:16.883
Sorry?

52:16.967 --> 52:19.678
I've only dated bad guys.

52:21.847 --> 52:22.764
I see.

52:23.473 --> 52:27.644
What's your ideal type?
Is there a certain type you like?

52:32.190 --> 52:34.192
<i>My ideal type is</i>

52:35.026 --> 52:38.113
<i>quite simple. Someone who's gentle
but strong on the inside.</i>

52:38.196 --> 52:40.699
<i>Someone who's well-mannered
and soft-spoken.</i>

52:40.782 --> 52:43.368
<i>Someone who exudes soft charisma.
I especially like women</i>

52:43.451 --> 52:45.245
who look good in <i>hanbok</i>.

52:46.204 --> 52:47.038
I see.

52:47.622 --> 52:50.792
I love watching historical dramas.

52:51.960 --> 52:55.964
We're polar opposites.
This is never going to work.

52:56.631 --> 52:59.050
Damn it.

53:21.615 --> 53:22.949
What does this mean?

53:23.533 --> 53:25.243
-Pay me.
-Pay you?

53:25.327 --> 53:27.287
Ms. Pyo said you'd pay me for today.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.957
That darn girl. I'm going
to take this out of her paycheck.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.209
No wonder they say
the rich are the greediest.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.878
She's your one and only friend.

53:34.961 --> 53:36.463
I was just joking.

53:37.255 --> 53:40.175
But I don't have cash.
I'll wire it to you later.

53:40.258 --> 53:41.718
Buy me food then. I'm hungry.

53:46.306 --> 53:50.060
What… What do you want to eat?

54:05.867 --> 54:08.787
Why did we have to come
all the way here for a meal?

54:08.870 --> 54:11.164
Too many prying eyes in Gongjin.

54:11.665 --> 54:12.749
But not here, right?

54:12.832 --> 54:15.835
Gosh. We might as well crawl
to the restaurant.

54:17.295 --> 54:18.421
-Are we good?
-What?

54:18.922 --> 54:19.923
Gosh.

54:20.840 --> 54:21.716
I'm coming.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.635
What should we have?

54:24.636 --> 54:26.846
-Snow crab?
-No. Something else.

54:27.430 --> 54:28.390
Then it's raw fish.

54:28.473 --> 54:30.642
-Do you have right-eyed flounders?
-Yes.

54:30.725 --> 54:33.228
Please slice one as it is
and season the other one.

54:33.311 --> 54:35.397
Sure. I'll bring it over soon.

54:35.480 --> 54:36.648
-Okay.
-Okay.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.279
I'm sorry about the other day.

54:45.281 --> 54:46.366
I was wrong.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.788
You know, the "social position" talk.

54:51.871 --> 54:55.041
Forget it. No need to be
sorry for your opinion.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.418
Still…

54:57.752 --> 54:59.337
By the way,

55:00.547 --> 55:02.507
you're from Seoul National University?

55:02.590 --> 55:03.550
How did you know?

55:03.633 --> 55:05.176
You really studied engineering?

55:05.260 --> 55:06.970
-What? You can't believe it?
-No.

55:09.347 --> 55:10.223
What are you doing?

55:12.892 --> 55:13.935
Solve this.

55:15.311 --> 55:16.146
What is this?

55:16.229 --> 55:17.605
A CSAT question.

55:18.314 --> 55:20.608
Who knows? You could be lying.

55:29.617 --> 55:30.452
Let's see.

55:42.005 --> 55:44.090
Here. The answer is number five.

55:44.716 --> 55:46.009
-Correct.
-Happy?

55:50.764 --> 55:51.765
One more.

55:51.848 --> 55:53.641
Unbelievable.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.114
Gosh.

56:11.409 --> 56:12.285
Then this one.

56:16.122 --> 56:17.082
Negative 27.

56:18.583 --> 56:20.752
-You even solved this?
-I did it in my head.

56:20.835 --> 56:21.753
Last one.

56:22.337 --> 56:23.671
-I promise.
-Come on.

56:32.722 --> 56:33.807
Correct.

56:35.433 --> 56:36.392
You got it right.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.269
You know you're childish, right?

56:39.312 --> 56:41.064
-Yes.
-Happy now?

56:41.147 --> 56:44.109
Not at all. I'm even more frustrated now.

56:44.192 --> 56:45.902
Why would you live like this?

56:45.985 --> 56:47.195
Then how should I?

56:47.278 --> 56:50.782
Live an honest life.
You should reap what you sow.

56:52.033 --> 56:53.743
I'm realistic.

56:53.827 --> 56:56.204
If there's an input,
there ought to be an output.

56:56.287 --> 56:59.374
And if your definition of output
is money and success,

56:59.457 --> 57:02.669
I must look like
an awfully inefficient individual.

57:03.336 --> 57:04.254
I can't deny that.

57:04.337 --> 57:06.965
-That's why you're a lost cause.
-What do you mean?

57:07.048 --> 57:08.758
You're so narrow-minded.

57:09.759 --> 57:13.638
Money and success aren't
the only valuable things in life.

57:14.639 --> 57:17.559
Happiness, self-contentment,
world peace, love…

57:19.727 --> 57:22.522
Anyway, life isn't
a mathematical equation.

57:22.605 --> 57:26.192
It doesn't have a clear answer.
There's no right answer either.

57:26.776 --> 57:29.904
You're just given a problem,
and it's up to you how you solve it.

57:29.988 --> 57:33.783
Fine, I get it. You and your nagging.

57:33.867 --> 57:36.453
All right. I'll give you
a question this time.

57:36.536 --> 57:37.787
Let's see.

57:38.663 --> 57:39.873
This will do.

57:41.749 --> 57:44.586
Chief Hong, I was
the top student in my math class.

57:45.128 --> 57:47.088
It's not easy to get into dental school.

57:48.506 --> 57:50.300
Unbelievable. Give it.

57:58.099 --> 58:00.935
-Shouldn't this be 5, not 2?
-It was a mistake.

58:03.730 --> 58:04.647
I have a headache.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.399
What's taking so long?

58:06.483 --> 58:08.318
Hold on. Give me a minute.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.072
My goodness.

58:13.156 --> 58:17.202
Are you guys kids or something?
Why did you scribble on the table?

58:17.869 --> 58:22.540
You've doodled from end to end
all over the table.

58:22.624 --> 58:25.126
That looks delicious. I'm sorry.

58:25.752 --> 58:27.545
You were saved by the bell.

58:28.171 --> 58:31.257
Had she come a bit later,
I would've solved it. What a pity.

58:51.236 --> 58:53.905
When did gray hair grow here?

59:05.708 --> 59:07.919
They say time is fair for everyone,

59:08.002 --> 59:10.046
but it seems like
I'm the only one who aged.

59:37.198 --> 59:38.408
1 UNREAD MESSAGE

59:38.491 --> 59:40.243
<i>Hwa-jeong, it's Cho-hui.</i>

59:40.326 --> 59:42.120
<i>Did you get treated well?</i>

59:42.745 --> 59:46.040
She's as kind to a fault as back then.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.751
VILLAGE CHIEF CHANG YEONG-GUK

59:51.629 --> 59:54.340
COME GET THE TRASH BAGS
FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

1:00:04.183 --> 1:00:07.020
Wait. I-jun, your tooth is growing.

1:00:07.979 --> 1:00:08.813
Really?

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:13.318
Yes. Soon, you'll have all adult teeth.

1:00:13.901 --> 1:00:15.653
I hope it'll be soon.

1:00:16.154 --> 1:00:17.155
Really?

1:00:18.406 --> 1:00:19.699
Well, I don't.

1:00:20.658 --> 1:00:21.618
Why not?

1:00:22.243 --> 1:00:23.369
Because I'm sad.

1:00:24.287 --> 1:00:26.331
I'm sad to see you grow up.

1:00:27.332 --> 1:00:30.710
I-jun, don't grow up too quickly, okay?

1:00:34.756 --> 1:00:35.715
It's here.

1:00:36.507 --> 1:00:37.717
It's growing.

1:00:39.177 --> 1:00:40.219
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1:00:40.803 --> 1:00:42.263
That was good.

1:00:45.725 --> 1:00:47.560
You have sauce on your lips.

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:53.316
-No. To your right.
-Here?

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:55.360
A bit up. Over there.

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:02.533
I can do it myself.

1:01:04.827 --> 1:01:06.496
What? What's the problem?

1:01:06.579 --> 1:01:08.164
Let's go if you're done.

1:01:08.956 --> 1:01:10.041
What's with you?

1:01:14.879 --> 1:01:17.131
They didn't say
it was going to rain today.

1:01:17.215 --> 1:01:18.800
It's okay. I have an umbrella.

1:01:19.384 --> 1:01:22.428
I always carry one
in case it rains, you know.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:25.181
Hold on. Where did it go?

1:01:26.307 --> 1:01:27.433
Looking for this?

1:01:29.143 --> 1:01:30.520
Why do you have it?

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:32.772
You left it that day.

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:35.149
I see.

1:01:36.818 --> 1:01:39.112
Let's walk to the car together.

1:02:02.051 --> 1:02:04.887
Are you nuts? I'm all drenched!

1:02:04.971 --> 1:02:06.973
So? Don't you feel refreshed?

1:02:07.056 --> 1:02:10.643
No, I don't.
It feels uncomfortable and damp.

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:13.980
So what?
Let your hair down and just feel it.

1:02:15.231 --> 1:02:17.692
You're bound to meet
unexpected situations in life.

1:02:17.775 --> 1:02:20.987
Even if you use an umbrella,
you'll end up getting drenched.

1:02:21.070 --> 1:02:24.157
Just put your hands up
and welcome the rain.

1:02:26.701 --> 1:02:28.327
Let's just play.

1:02:30.163 --> 1:02:32.832
-Stop that.
-Why? It's fun!

1:02:32.915 --> 1:02:33.916
Stop it.

1:02:39.172 --> 1:02:40.423
Wait!

1:03:25.384 --> 1:03:27.637
They're having a blast.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:33.476
Timeout.

1:03:34.852 --> 1:03:37.855
Let's call a truce. I'm exhausted.

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:39.732
Agreed.

1:03:40.274 --> 1:03:42.777
So? Getting wet in the rain
isn't that bad, right?

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:45.863
Who knows? I might catch a cold tomorrow.

1:04:04.006 --> 1:04:05.341
<i>It's so hot.</i>

1:04:31.117 --> 1:04:32.910
It's better now.

1:05:05.943 --> 1:05:09.447
You're not running a fever,
but let's stop here just in case.

1:05:24.253 --> 1:05:26.172
-Chief Hong.
-Yes?

1:05:27.214 --> 1:05:28.507
About…

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:31.427
that night…

1:05:33.554 --> 1:05:35.181
Are you sure nothing happened?

1:05:37.516 --> 1:05:39.977
Yes. Nothing happened.

1:05:41.646 --> 1:05:42.605
Really?

1:05:44.523 --> 1:05:45.483
Yes.

1:06:08.506 --> 1:06:12.593
Are you still having the same nightmare?

1:06:15.221 --> 1:06:16.138
Yes.

1:08:35.694 --> 1:08:37.113
Hye-jin, you're losing it.

1:08:37.196 --> 1:08:38.030
<i>Is anything the matter?</i>

1:08:38.114 --> 1:08:40.533
He obviously remembers
but is playing dumb.

1:08:40.616 --> 1:08:43.035
I'm only asking out of pure curiosity,

1:08:43.119 --> 1:08:44.703
<i>but what do you think of Chief Hong?</i>

1:08:44.787 --> 1:08:47.164
<i>I get that being nosy is incurable,</i>

1:08:47.248 --> 1:08:49.291
<i>but I'd appreciate less of your concern.</i>

1:08:49.375 --> 1:08:50.793
That really hurts my feelings.

1:08:50.876 --> 1:08:52.128
You have the wrong idea.

1:08:54.171 --> 1:08:56.006
<i>Why does it have to be at my expense?</i>

1:08:56.090 --> 1:08:58.926
<i>It's upsetting and I'm offended.</i>

1:08:59.635 --> 1:09:02.555
That drink sure was strong.

1:09:02.638 --> 1:09:04.056
<i>You exhaust me.</i>

1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:06.183
<i>I don't care for the rumors.</i>

1:09:06.267 --> 1:09:08.269
<i>I'd like for you
to stop crossing the line.</i>

1:09:10.187 --> 1:09:15.192
