01:50.383 --> 01:54.976
Barry. Barry. Barry.
Wake up, buddy.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.183
Fuches?
Hey!

02:02.624 --> 02:04.464
How long were you watching me sleep?

02:04.928 --> 02:07.232
The money from
the Rochester job just cleared.

02:08.168 --> 02:10.304
One less bad guy in the world.
Nice work.

02:10.543 --> 02:11.810
As usual, Barry.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.912
Oh, ahh, he was in bed
so it wasn't work, exactly.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.014
Why'd it take two days?

02:18.679 --> 02:20.544
I was doing recon.
Oh.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.080
To make it clean

02:22.336 --> 02:23.104
Or

02:23.616 --> 02:26.583
were you layin' around the hotel room
like in Sioux Falls last month

02:26.613 --> 02:27.982
or St. Paul before that?

02:28.012 --> 02:29.960
Look, these extra expenses,
they add up, Barry.

02:30.060 --> 02:31.172
Ok.
Alright!

02:32.494 --> 02:34.989
Ah, God. I worry about you, buddy.
This...

02:35.019 --> 02:37.247
shit heap looks like the old Barry

02:37.440 --> 02:38.622
before he had a purpose.

02:38.652 --> 02:40.994
No, no, I just think I'm burning out.

02:41.024 --> 02:42.429
You know, maybe I need a break.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.376
Hey, you know what I think?
What?

02:45.632 --> 02:48.448
I think what we should do is
shake things up a little bit.

02:49.305 --> 02:51.559
You know, so instead of burnin' another

02:51.589 --> 02:55.077
small town hood in some
snowed-in Rust Belt shithole,

02:55.285 --> 02:59.578
what do you say to a little trip
out to sunny Los Angeles?

03:00.480 --> 03:04.752
You came here to give me an assignment?
Chechen mob. Come here.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.669
A guy by the name of Goran Pazer

03:08.699 --> 03:11.970
needs an outsider to handle
something embarrassing.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.536
It's great money!

03:14.191 --> 03:17.376
Get us a lot closer to where we
need to be to hang it all up someday.

03:17.632 --> 03:18.880
What, when you think that'll be?

03:18.910 --> 03:23.024
Plane for LA leaves in 4 hours.
I will have a car waiting for

03:23.054 --> 03:26.336
for you at the Ontario airport.
But Ontario,

03:26.753 --> 03:29.247
Wait. Isn't that like a 2 hour drive?
You can't just, you know

03:29.277 --> 03:32.450
fly into LAX.
We gotta cover our tracks, right?

03:32.480 --> 03:35.902
Why, because it's cheaper or...
Because it is smarter, Barry!

03:37.017 --> 03:38.944
How much cheaper was it?

03:49.822 --> 03:52.093
Hey, Barry Fuches,
probably still on the plane

03:52.293 --> 03:54.008
but welcome to California, buddy.

03:54.038 --> 03:55.389
Hey, my guy said he left

03:55.589 --> 03:56.828
the car in Space 408.

03:56.858 --> 03:59.586
I told him you were my best guy
so he should hook you up.

03:59.616 --> 04:03.472
He said the car is dope,
so, enjoy that, buddy.

04:03.502 --> 04:06.458
When you meet Goran,
don't be afraid to sell yourself.

04:06.488 --> 04:10.355
Remember that liquor distributor
in Kent you stabbed in the nut?

04:10.385 --> 04:14.512
I think Goran's the kind of man that
would find something like that intriguing,

04:14.542 --> 04:17.577
so work it into the conversation and
make him aware that, you know,

04:17.880 --> 04:21.999
you'll go there...
Fuckin' dick...fuckin' dick!

04:23.375 --> 04:27.343
Hey, man, you must be Barry!
I'm NoHo Hank.

04:27.775 --> 04:29.823
The flight was good, no?

04:31.103 --> 04:34.269
Are you hungry? I mean,
you want a submarine sandwich?

04:34.299 --> 04:39.468
If you're thirsty, we've got juice boxes,
Hawaiian Punch or maybe beer or something.

04:39.807 --> 04:42.265
So, we're gonna do this outside,
if that's ok.

04:42.295 --> 04:44.325
His daughter has some friends over.
Huh?

04:44.355 --> 04:45.931
They're watching their Jessie.

04:46.207 --> 04:47.185
Did the bowling alley run

04:47.385 --> 04:48.285
out of shoe freshener?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.290
We haven't been in LA long

04:51.654 --> 04:53.601
but we've made a lot of progress...

04:53.865 --> 04:56.943
harbors, identity theft,
meth, 99 Cent stores.

04:57.143 --> 04:59.263
Business has been going great.

04:59.775 --> 05:00.799
Recently,

05:01.567 --> 05:02.827
personal matters cropped up,

05:02.927 --> 05:05.277
which needs to be kept
separate from the business,

05:06.431 --> 05:07.199
so we called you.

05:08.828 --> 05:10.753
This is Ryan Madison.

05:10.783 --> 05:12.575
He's a physical trainer in Silver Lake.

05:12.831 --> 05:14.623
He works with Goran's wife Oksana.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.671
They been training together for

05:17.429 --> 05:22.940
What you think? 1, 2, 3, 2?
2, 3 months, yeah? Yeah?

05:25.119 --> 05:27.935
Over the past few weeks,
these sessions became more frequent.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.835
Goran asked me to follow her

05:31.119 --> 05:32.246
and I became aware that

05:32.346 --> 05:34.993
they were taking up at a
Holiday Inn in Studio City.

05:36.186 --> 05:37.925
I snuck a lipstick camera,

05:38.943 --> 05:40.223
similar to this one,

05:40.479 --> 05:41.247
in the room

05:42.121 --> 05:44.218
and got this.

05:50.191 --> 05:51.721
Why would I want to see this?

05:52.383 --> 05:53.517
Turn it off.

05:54.348 --> 05:55.973
Turn it off!

05:56.351 --> 05:58.733
I wanted to give him the whole...
He gets it!

05:58.763 --> 05:59.939
You already said they

06:00.139 --> 06:01.484
are taking up in hotel.

06:01.514 --> 06:02.676
It's important.
Why show footage?

06:02.706 --> 06:05.715
For you are just impressed
with yourself for planting camera.

06:05.745 --> 06:08.047
Trash that footage!
Ok!

06:08.077 --> 06:10.014
Do you guys want him gone?
Yes!

06:10.044 --> 06:11.488
Good, ok.
We pay you...

06:11.518 --> 06:13.661
No, you don't pay me anything.
Fuches takes care of the money.

06:13.691 --> 06:16.855
I just need his name and address
and I'll be done in a couple of days.

06:17.599 --> 06:20.671
That sounds good.
Alright, now there's a lot of ways I can

06:21.545 --> 06:23.472
do this for you. Umm...

06:24.858 --> 06:25.841
One of them

06:27.191 --> 06:28.590
is I could stab him in the nut.

06:29.562 --> 06:31.394
That's something I did once

06:32.064 --> 06:32.952
And I am

06:33.471 --> 06:35.007
very comfortable doing it again

06:35.775 --> 06:37.344
What?
Why not?

06:37.567 --> 06:38.591
Why?

06:38.919 --> 06:39.841
Who would want this?

06:39.871 --> 06:41.252
Can't you just shoot him?
Yeah.

06:41.282 --> 06:42.820
Because being shot is very painful.

06:43.293 --> 06:45.447
Have you ever been shot?
Huh, I have.

06:45.477 --> 06:48.993
It's like crazy painful.
Anything is better than stabbing guy in nut.

06:49.023 --> 06:50.649
I'll shoot him, I'll shoot him,
I'll shoot him.

06:50.749 --> 06:51.534
Ok.

06:52.098 --> 06:52.854
Goran...

06:53.664 --> 06:55.138
I think he's going to shoot him.

07:10.259 --> 07:12.338
No silencer. Thanks, dudes!

08:45.325 --> 08:48.198
Fuck you two.
Don't you fucking call me lady.

08:48.618 --> 08:52.152
Don't you fucking call me lady,
you fucking asshole!

08:52.454 --> 08:55.232
You motherfucker!
Fuck you too!

08:55.262 --> 08:58.709
Don't you fucking call me lady!
Fuck you too!

08:59.261 --> 09:01.680
Who are you?
What are you doing out here?

09:02.062 --> 09:07.051
Shit, I lost my place. Dammit!
Sally, he's ready for you!

09:08.380 --> 09:09.306
Shit!

09:11.536 --> 09:12.480
Thanks a lot!

09:18.317 --> 09:19.110
Strong.

09:19.337 --> 09:20.830
Strong stuff you got here.
Boy,

09:22.984 --> 09:24.716
What you got wrong with you
that you need all this stuff?

09:26.015 --> 09:28.076
You motherfucker.
What?

09:29.087 --> 09:30.587
You fucking asshole.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.294
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck do you think you are?

09:34.324 --> 09:35.730
Please lady, why don't you just

09:35.760 --> 09:37.771
try to calm down.
Bullshit!

09:39.034 --> 09:41.321
Bullshit!
It's false, Sally.

09:42.143 --> 09:45.139
I know, I got thrown off right
before I was about to go on.

09:45.169 --> 09:48.049
I was outside going...
Excuse me! I don't give a shit.

09:48.693 --> 09:50.335
Even your excuses are false.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.392
You're up there, you're
stinkin' up my stage, babe

09:54.251 --> 09:56.538
What the fuck do you want?

10:00.319 --> 10:02.574
The prescription.
Not Linda! You.

10:03.647 --> 10:06.320
Little Sally Reed from Joplin, Missouri...

10:06.350 --> 10:08.644
What do you want?

10:10.061 --> 10:11.809
To be an actress.
Again!

10:11.839 --> 10:13.438
I don't believe you

10:15.597 --> 10:17.471
It's all I ever wanted in the whole world.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.019
Oh, really?

10:19.049 --> 10:21.359
Except you don't think
you're going to make it, do you?

10:21.683 --> 10:23.327
I mean, that's what you told me.

10:23.615 --> 10:24.499
Oh, yeah.

10:24.971 --> 10:25.784
Last week

10:26.281 --> 10:27.026
She takes me out for a

10:27.126 --> 10:28.586
cup of coffee after class,

10:28.616 --> 10:31.572
starts to cry,
snot running down her nose

10:31.602 --> 10:34.327
All of a sudden she said:
"I'm not gonna make it."

10:34.357 --> 10:37.409
I'm telling you I was embarrassed.
It was pathetic.

10:37.614 --> 10:42.047
Here is a person who's spending her money.
She doesn't have any talent whatsoever.

10:42.303 --> 10:44.863
This chick shouldn't even be in this class.

10:45.185 --> 10:48.191
I cannot believe...
That is not fair, Gene!

10:49.471 --> 10:52.006
Don't think, just finish the scene.

10:57.510 --> 10:59.181
Don't you call me lady.

10:59.455 --> 11:02.862
I come in here. I give these things
to you you. You check...

11:03.119 --> 11:04.289
I'm sick!

11:04.497 --> 11:07.903
I have sickness all around me
and you fucking ask me my life?

11:08.277 --> 11:10.689
Have you seen death in your bed?
In your house?

11:10.900 --> 11:12.859
And then I'm asked fucking questions?

11:13.108 --> 11:16.442
What's wrong?
Suck my dick!

11:16.607 --> 11:18.059
that's what's wrong!

11:18.869 --> 11:19.679
Shame on you.

11:21.285 --> 11:22.378
Shame on you.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.993
Suck my dick.

11:36.847 --> 11:37.634
End scene.

11:45.902 --> 11:48.970
You know that I had to do that, right?
You know I love you.

11:50.464 --> 11:53.757
Alright.That was something.

11:54.239 --> 11:57.178
Now, as beautiful Sally just demonstrated

11:57.483 --> 11:58.912
that's what this class is about.

11:59.163 --> 12:04.480
Life! I want you to create
a life right here on this stage.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.731
I mean, we're not here studying
some fucking TV commercial acting.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.361
That's not why you came to LA, is it?

12:11.391 --> 12:14.460
You didn't move all the way
across the country for that.

12:14.490 --> 12:16.234
This is the theater.

12:17.632 --> 12:18.419
Now,

12:18.788 --> 12:21.728
Let's give her another round.
She deserves the praise.

12:23.954 --> 12:25.480
Hey, man!
Are you new to this class?

12:25.834 --> 12:27.199
Haven't seen you before
I'm Ryan.

12:27.229 --> 12:28.719
Ryan Madison. Listen I
was supposed to put up

12:28.819 --> 12:31.375
a scene with Matt Kennedy
but he got a catering gig.

12:31.755 --> 12:34.309
Help me out?
Ryan, you're up>

12:34.339 --> 12:37.763
Where's Kennedy?
He's not here.

12:38.735 --> 12:43.391
But I'm going to do the scene with him.

12:43.599 --> 12:46.207
Grab a seat there, boy.
Grab some egg roll.

12:47.347 --> 12:51.563
We got everything here from
a Diddle-eye Joe to a Vin D'Vando.

12:53.155 --> 12:55.423
Mean you ate before you came on
down here? All full, is that it?

12:55.679 --> 12:57.435
Naw, I don't think so.

12:58.239 --> 13:00.140
I think you too scared to be eatin'.

13:00.799 --> 13:02.079
See, you ain't even sat down yet.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.247
On that TV over there,
since you been in the room,

13:04.277 --> 13:05.998
is a woman with her titties hanging out.

13:06.261 --> 13:07.707
Now. I know I'm pretty

13:08.276 --> 13:09.630
but I ain't as pretty

13:09.830 --> 13:11.377
as a couple of titties.

13:17.325 --> 13:19.189
What's in that envelope is
for my peace of mind.

13:19.219 --> 13:22.209
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not 1 penny more, not 1 penny more.

13:30.086 --> 13:30.751
It's empty.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.452
End scene.

14:00.191 --> 14:00.884
Who are you?

14:02.239 --> 14:02.751
Barry.

14:03.007 --> 14:03.775
Barry what?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.830
Burkman.
Well, Barry Burkman,

14:07.860 --> 14:10.208
you just used up your one free audit class.

14:10.562 --> 14:13.342
You want to be here on Thursday,
you better prepare a monologue.

14:13.372 --> 14:14.225
You understand?

14:18.950 --> 14:19.881
Wow!

14:21.183 --> 14:22.560
Ok, who's next?

14:32.884 --> 14:34.880
Hey! Hey, Barry.

14:34.910 --> 14:38.190
Hey I just wanted to say sorry
for snapping at you back there.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.069
I didn't realize you were an actor.

14:40.099 --> 14:42.431
Ah, I'm not an actor.
What are you gonna do for your monologue?

14:42.687 --> 14:44.085
I did the scene from The Blind Side.

14:44.115 --> 14:46.497
You know, the one where
Sandy Bullock interrupts football practice?

14:48.983 --> 14:50.799
Do you remember that?
It won her an Oscar.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.670
I'm not doing a monologue.
What would be a good mono for you?

14:55.999 --> 14:58.447
Let's go brainstorm.
A bunch of us are going to Residuals.

15:00.805 --> 15:01.857
What's Residuals?

15:05.995 --> 15:07.843
What if you did Robert Duvall
from Tender Mercies.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.686
Oh, yes, yes, the one where
he's working with his daughter.

15:10.716 --> 15:13.578
Or Brad Pitt from Fight Club.
Oh, I love... yes.

15:13.608 --> 15:17.618
To me, the most important thing is honesty.
Like whatever you can bring your truth to.

15:17.648 --> 15:20.582
Wait, what is that Kevin Spacey movie?

15:20.612 --> 15:22.452
You know, the one where
he's the bad guy. He's got the limb...

15:22.482 --> 15:26.082
Oh, Indian guy... India.

15:27.684 --> 15:30.801
K-Pax.
Did you just move here, Barry?

15:30.831 --> 15:33.709
Yeah, from Cleveland.
Huh, cool!

15:33.739 --> 15:36.389
Welcome to Los Angeles.
Oh, are you from LA?

15:36.419 --> 15:39.939
Nobody's actually from LA.
Oh, Barry, I am, though.

15:40.172 --> 15:45.184
The Snake is from Florida,
Germaine's from Denver

15:45.214 --> 15:48.413
and Antonio here, he's from...
Puerto Rico

15:48.443 --> 15:49.473
Puerto Rico

15:49.503 --> 15:51.767
Yeah, he just booked CSI.
It's true.

15:52.169 --> 15:53.984
I'm playing a dead body on that show.

15:54.623 --> 15:58.400
Next time,
I'm going to play somebody who's alive.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.836
It's about talent, for sure.

16:00.997 --> 16:03.313
But mostly, it's about passion.

16:03.343 --> 16:04.969
I mean,
do you think Meryl Streep and Kaley Cuoco

16:05.169 --> 16:06.659
became stars just because they're the best?

16:06.819 --> 16:09.215
No, it's because they wanted it the most.

16:10.898 --> 16:13.567
Look, there's always a million reasons
not to do something, Barry.

16:14.230 --> 16:15.103
But if you want it,

16:16.127 --> 16:16.840
go for it.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.357
My girlfriend dates a
manager at the Standard,

16:20.387 --> 16:22.100
so, if you have bartending experience
or lie and say you do,

16:22.200 --> 16:23.521
I can get you a job there.

16:23.766 --> 16:24.575
Oh, I have a job.

16:25.726 --> 16:26.256
Sales.

16:26.623 --> 16:28.133
Auto parts.
Huh!

16:28.163 --> 16:30.559
Ah, that's cool.
Different!

16:31.646 --> 16:32.932
I don't have a job.
Oh, my God!

16:32.962 --> 16:35.084
Look at Lydia.
She's out there all by herself.

16:38.062 --> 16:39.589
C'mon, let's go dance.
Ok.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.978
Oh, I don't dance.
Bullshit! Yeah, you do.

16:43.008 --> 16:44.311
I can tell you want to dance.

16:45.428 --> 16:48.721
Ok, no pressure.
You'll know where to find me.

17:18.613 --> 17:20.133
Barry Burkman.

17:21.595 --> 17:26.271
Barry Burkman.
You gotta change that name.

17:27.491 --> 17:28.486
I changed my name.

17:29.305 --> 17:31.264
My real name"s Richard Crimph.

17:32.550 --> 17:37.899
Ryan Madison sounds way cooler.
Barry Burkman, it's too plain.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.602
You sound like an accountant or something.

17:40.203 --> 17:42.532
You want something people can remember.

17:46.291 --> 17:49.875
I got the perfect stage name for you.
What?

17:52.895 --> 17:55.995
Barry Block.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.783
Barry Block?

17:59.039 --> 17:59.811
I don't get it.

17:59.841 --> 18:02.269
Yeah, causes when I
look at you, I think of a block.

18:03.647 --> 18:07.296
Hey, Barry hey, hey...
Yeah?

18:07.954 --> 18:10.559
Can you drive him home?
He has like 7 DUI's.

18:11.665 --> 18:12.902
Sure.
Goodnight.

18:13.737 --> 18:15.183
Looking forward to your monologue.

18:23.207 --> 18:26.431
What?
C'mon, you gotta take this class, bro!

18:27.406 --> 18:31.470
I don't think I can.
It's not that hard. Here...

18:31.711 --> 18:36.476
Look, it's all in the book.
This is your new bible.

18:36.669 --> 18:39.762
Gene's teachings changed my life.
So, you go home,

18:39.792 --> 18:42.468
You Google great monologues,
you choose one,

18:42.498 --> 18:44.379
and I'll help you prepare before tomorrow.

18:45.504 --> 18:47.167
You're gonna help me with my audition?

18:48.311 --> 18:51.620
Why?
Ah, you're my scene partner, bro.

18:51.650 --> 18:53.243
We've rocked it out today.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.847
You were so chill, you just...

18:55.103 --> 18:57.741
let me do my thing.
You're a very generous performer.

18:58.614 --> 18:59.578
I am?

19:00.101 --> 19:00.991
Totally!

19:02.271 --> 19:06.427
So, I will see you tomorrow, scene partner.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.195
What the fuck?

19:20.714 --> 19:23.815
Barry Madison, third watch.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.395
What the fuck?

19:30.082 --> 19:31.747
They were hugging.

19:41.183 --> 19:44.327
Hey, Fuches.
Hey, buddy. I'm outside, open up.

19:45.279 --> 19:46.303
You're here?

19:48.956 --> 19:52.868
So, this NoHo Hank guy
wakes me up last night.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.284
Says you and your mark were hugging.

19:58.419 --> 19:59.897
They saw that?
Oh, yeah.

19:59.927 --> 20:03.077
Look, look, look. Something
really, really cool happened, ok?

20:03.498 --> 20:05.346
Ok.
I followed Ryan yesterday

20:05.506 --> 20:08.462
and he went to this theater
to take an acting class.

20:08.848 --> 20:11.236
and I ended doin' a scene
with him from True Romance.

20:11.828 --> 20:13.780
True Romance is a movie.

20:14.744 --> 20:17.976
Yeah, it's LA theater, so I guess all
the scenes they do are from movies.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.392
The point is, I was really good.

20:20.607 --> 20:24.015
And afterwards, I hung out with all of them.
Then?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.977
The acting class. And they're super nice,
The whole class?

20:27.007 --> 20:30.319
Including the guy you were supposed to burn?
Ryan Madison, yeah.

20:30.349 --> 20:33.343
No, he's a great dude and
I don't know, they just made me feel

20:33.373 --> 20:36.326
really good about myself,
you know, and...

20:37.106 --> 20:39.551
You know how you and I
talk all the time about my purpose?

20:40.335 --> 20:42.159
You think acting could be your purpose?

20:43.519 --> 20:44.511
I don't know.

20:44.751 --> 20:47.731
I just feel really motivated
right now or something.

20:47.761 --> 20:49.747
It made me feel really good.
Ok, but what about

20:49.777 --> 20:51.171
what we do together, Barry?

20:51.658 --> 20:54.058
Well, you know, they told me
a very small percentage of actors

20:54.088 --> 20:56.908
actually make a living acting,
you know, so most have a day job.

20:56.938 --> 20:59.366
So, I just figured,
you know, I'd do night hits or...

20:59.566 --> 21:00.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

21:01.470 --> 21:02.286
Sit.
Oh.

21:02.316 --> 21:04.110
Ok? Now, Barry...

21:04.846 --> 21:11.551
Acting is a very face forward
type of job. It...

21:12.991 --> 21:18.111
it's a direct conflict to being someone
who anonymously kills people.

21:18.271 --> 21:24.352
You want to have a hobby or something,
you could take up painting. Hitler painted.

21:24.382 --> 21:27.874
John Wayne Gay painted.
It's a good solid hobby.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.394
Never got in the way of
what they were doin'.

21:29.424 --> 21:31.762
These are professional actors and

21:32.002 --> 21:34.020
they're the real deal and
they say I got something.

21:34.050 --> 21:36.753
No. I get it but I think
you gotta think this thing through.

21:36.783 --> 21:39.635
I mean, you want to go out there and
try to burn a guy and have him say

21:39.665 --> 21:42.963
Hey, there's the guy
from the chicken commercial.

21:43.491 --> 21:45.143
I don't know if I do commercials.

21:46.839 --> 21:51.015
Barry, when you decided
to do this for a living,

21:51.045 --> 21:53.431
you closed the door on
being able to do anything else.

21:54.915 --> 21:57.395
You're a killer, Barry.
You kill the bad guys.

21:57.425 --> 22:02.752
Yeah, but this Ryan guy wasn't a bad guy,
he lent me a book.

22:03.200 --> 22:06.128
These Chechens are the
scariest people I've ever worked with

22:06.158 --> 22:08.736
and they're talkin' about
taking you off this job.

22:10.592 --> 22:11.549
Off the job?

22:11.579 --> 22:15.981
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like dying
over some wannabe actor.

22:18.653 --> 22:21.952
This is what you do

22:22.125 --> 22:26.001
This is all you do.
You understand?

22:28.369 --> 22:29.269
Yeah.

22:29.973 --> 22:30.677
Ok, good.

23:35.418 --> 23:37.818
Hey, Mr. Cousineau.
You weren't in class today.

23:38.154 --> 23:40.032
Yeah, I know, I know.
Ryan was very upset.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.336
Yeah. No, I gotta leave town.

23:42.736 --> 23:44.096
I'm so sorry to hear that.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.688
Hey, Mr. Cousineau,
I was wondering, um...

23:48.128 --> 23:50.160
Do you think I was good enough
to be in your class?

23:53.248 --> 23:54.768
No, Barry, I don't.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.208
What you did was dog shit.

23:58.576 --> 24:00.624
I mean really, really awful.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.520
Dumb acting, I call it.
Do you know why?

24:05.120 --> 24:07.440
Because acting is truth

24:07.856 --> 24:10.000
and I saw no truth.

24:10.496 --> 24:12.288
So here's my advice to you.

24:12.688 --> 24:14.852
You go back to whatever
nook of the world

24:14.952 --> 24:17.920
you call home and you do
whatever it is you're good.

24:18.592 --> 24:21.280
Because this is not it.

24:22.992 --> 24:24.240
You want to know what I'm good at?

24:25.760 --> 24:27.120
I'm good at killin' people.

24:30.864 --> 24:32.768
You know, when I
got back from Afghanistan, I, ah...

24:33.952 --> 24:35.118
I was really depressed, you know.

24:35.318 --> 24:37.120
Like, I didn't leave my house
for months and, eh...

24:37.808 --> 24:41.600
This friend of my Dad's,
he's like an uncle to me. He...

24:42.080 --> 24:43.776
He helped me out and
he gave me a purpose.

24:45.568 --> 24:46.576
He told me that...

24:47.488 --> 24:49.664
that what I was good at
over there could be useful here.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.696
and, uh,...

24:52.736 --> 24:55.160
it's a job., you know...

24:55.352 --> 24:58.640
The money's good and
these people I take out, like, they're...

24:59.648 --> 25:02.656
They're bad people.
You know, like, they're like pieces of shit.

25:05.488 --> 25:09.088
Relate Leeds United

25:11.680 --> 25:13.728
But lately, you know, I'm not sleeping and

25:16.688 --> 25:17.312
like,

25:18.160 --> 25:20.128
like I know there's more to me

25:20.896 --> 25:21.568
than that.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.696
Maybe, I don't know.

25:27.552 --> 25:28.320
Maybe there's not.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.304
Maybe this is all I'm good at.

25:39.728 --> 25:41.040
Anyway, forget it.

25:41.888 --> 25:42.832
Sorry to bother you.

25:44.192 --> 25:45.360
Where's that from?

25:47.448 --> 25:48.136
What?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.918
Are you telling me
that was an improvisation?

25:52.896 --> 25:53.664
Interesting.

25:54.432 --> 25:56.224
The story's nonsense but

25:56.736 --> 25:58.192
there's something to work with.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.280
My class is not cheap

26:02.368 --> 26:03.984
That's not a problem.
You pay in cash.

26:04.176 --> 26:05.600
Yeah.
You pay in advance.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.744
Next class tomorrow.
I can do that.

26:08.000 --> 26:08.768
2 PM.

26:09.616 --> 26:11.504
We start on time.
Absolutely.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.184
What's your last name, again?

26:14.272 --> 26:14.864
Block.

26:15.936 --> 26:16.560
Barry Block.

26:17.088 --> 26:18.912
You pay in advance.
Yeah. Now I know.

26:19.264 --> 26:20.770
Gene M. Cousineau.

26:21.632 --> 26:22.944
I look forward to this journey.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.976
Great.
Watch your toes.

27:30.432 --> 27:31.968
What's goin' on, guys?

27:33.914 --> 27:35.306
No, no, no, no no.

27:35.514 --> 27:38.154
Now! Take a shot!
Shoot him! Now!

27:38.184 --> 27:41.506
Don't point a gun at me, man.
Don't point the gun at me.

27:41.510 --> 27:42.906
Take the shot!

27:55.893 --> 27:56.661
Fuck!

28:37.223 --> 28:39.469
God, I wonder what's
going on over there?

28:40.397 --> 28:42.557
Do you have whiskey?
No.

28:42.813 --> 28:45.805
We have herbal tea.
I'll have herbal tea.

28:47.201 --> 28:48.513
What do got there?

28:48.864 --> 28:52.272
Oh, I've got an audition tomorrow.
I'm an actor.

28:55.712 --> 28:56.656
So am I.
