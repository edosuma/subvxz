Oh, did you find
the photo album?

01:39.130 --> 01:42.140
Of course. I'm the one that has
to paste in all the pictures.

01:42.140 --> 01:45.690
Good job.

01:45.690 --> 01:46.770
Okay, she's coming now.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.270
Will you pick that stuff up

01:48.270 --> 01:49.280
and get it
out of here?

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
Yeah, we are, Dad, we are.
Dad, we are.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.110
All right, now,
remember the plan.

01:52.110 --> 01:53.700
I'm taking your mother bowling;
she still thinks

01:53.700 --> 01:54.700
I've forgotten
it's our anniversary.

01:54.700 --> 01:55.620
And Ralph's coming by

01:55.620 --> 01:56.700
with all the decorations.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.200
Yeah, and you guys
are gonna put them up

01:58.200 --> 01:59.150
all over
the place.
Dad,

01:59.150 --> 02:00.240
don't worry about it.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
We'll make
the place look super

02:01.240 --> 02:02.960
for your anniversary party.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.040
Good, good.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.540
Well, anyway,
at the right moment...

02:06.540 --> 02:08.289
Why are you sitting down?

02:08.289 --> 02:09.380
We can't do anything
until you leave.

02:09.380 --> 02:10.380
Oh, right.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.970
Well, at the right moment,

02:11.970 --> 02:14.000
I'm going to pick a fight
with your mother.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.590
I remember an argument
that was a real beaut.

02:15.590 --> 02:17.590
Huh, remember that?

02:18.590 --> 02:21.010
Howard,
why is your fez limp?

02:24.230 --> 02:26.680
I found it in a basket
of clean laundry.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.730
Oh, that's why
it collapsed.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.730
It must have gotten
mixed up in the wash.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.230
Of all the harebrained,
irresponsible things...

02:31.230 --> 02:33.020
Harebrained?!
I've got to be
at a meeting

02:33.020 --> 02:34.990
in a half an hour, and
I don't have any dinner,

02:34.990 --> 02:38.070
and I've got a limp fez!

02:38.070 --> 02:40.080
"Marion, do this.
Marion, do that."

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
You want your dinner?

02:41.080 --> 02:42.580
I'll get your dinner,
you've got it.

02:42.580 --> 02:43.750
I'll get your dinner.

02:43.750 --> 02:44.830
I've done it a
thousand times.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.830
I can do it with
my eyes closed.

02:47.830 --> 02:50.840
Here is your salad,

02:50.840 --> 02:53.840
your vegetable,
your meat.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.340
Live it up!

02:59.430 --> 03:02.430
And then when we come home, we
come through the front door,

03:02.430 --> 03:04.430
everybody yell
"Surprise!"

03:04.430 --> 03:06.440
What was that,
Howard?

03:06.440 --> 03:07.940
Uh, uh, uh,
w... uh...

03:07.940 --> 03:09.940
Uh, it was "sunrise."

03:10.440 --> 03:12.940
Uh, there's a very early sunrise
tomorrow, very early.

03:12.940 --> 03:15.450
That's one I
owe you, Richie.

03:15.450 --> 03:17.950
Okay, sweetheart, come on,
let's go, we'll be late.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.480
See you.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.570
Have a good time.
MARION:
See you later.

03:20.570 --> 03:21.450
Yeah, bowl well, Mom.
Yeah.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.040
Uh, uh, M-Marion, you
can't bowl in that sweater.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.040
You'll get
it all dirty.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
Well, I'll take it off.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.550
Oh, no, no, no, I, I think
you should go upstairs

03:32.550 --> 03:34.160
and put on your
dark blue one.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.250
All right.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.720
Suddenly,
he notices the way I dress.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.300
(chuckling)

03:39.300 --> 03:40.300
Oh.
Oh.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.810
(whispering):
Come on in, Fonz.

03:43.810 --> 03:46.810
A door slammed in the face
of a man bearing gifts?

03:46.810 --> 03:49.310
Give me that.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.810
Hey, didn't I see a welcome
mat on your front door?

03:51.810 --> 03:54.320
Yeah, but we don't want Mom
to-to see the gifts.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.320
Good idea, all right.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.320
Oh, listen, Fonzie, if
my cousin Nancy gets back

03:58.320 --> 04:00.820
before we do, will you
be nice to her, huh?

04:00.820 --> 04:03.830
Hey, Mr. C., I will be
my very, very charming self.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.110
Yeah.

04:05.110 --> 04:08.920
How is this, Howard?
How's what?

04:08.920 --> 04:10.870
Dad, the sweater.
Oh, oh!

04:10.870 --> 04:12.200
It's lovely, lovely.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.790
Come on,
sweetheart.

04:13.790 --> 04:14.790
Hello, Arthur.

04:14.790 --> 04:17.290
Hey, Mrs. C.,
how are you?

04:17.290 --> 04:20.790
Listen, you just go
and bowl your heart out.

04:20.790 --> 04:21.790
See you later.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.380
JOANIE:
Bye, have a good time.

04:23.380 --> 04:25.970
MARION:
Well, good-bye, kids...

04:25.970 --> 04:28.180
(balloon pops, Ralph screams)

04:28.180 --> 04:29.550
What was that yelp?

04:29.550 --> 04:30.890
Oh, just some strange dog.

04:35.690 --> 04:38.190
You have
a nice time, kids.

04:38.190 --> 04:41.650
Uh, w-w-wait just a minute,
will you, sweetheart?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.570
(Potsie yelping)

04:44.570 --> 04:46.650
It's all right now.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.660
What is going on?

04:48.660 --> 04:50.660
It was that strange dog again.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.470
Howie popped my balloon.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.470
He threw me
in the bushes.

05:01.470 --> 05:04.470
I always thought
he liked me.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.470
We can pal around
together, go to a ball game.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.930
Oh, sure we can,
Potsie.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.980
I'm not taking him
to any ball game.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.980
Hiya, Pops.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.980
(groans)

05:15.980 --> 05:20.100
Potsie, uh, do you have
anything planned for tonight?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.690
Oh, I'm free this evening.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.160
What do you want to do?

05:25.610 --> 05:29.160
Oh, gee whiz, I got
to help Marion with the dishes.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.700
I'm free tomorrow night, too.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.700
(dishes breaking)

05:32.700 --> 05:35.750
(talking indistinctly)

05:35.750 --> 05:37.750
Why are you going
to hang up snapshots?

05:37.750 --> 05:38.760
Oh, I got this
idea, Fonz.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.260
You see, I, I want
to take us all

05:41.260 --> 05:43.260
through the years
pictorially.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.710
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

05:44.710 --> 05:49.270
So, then we can see the Big H
become the, uh, <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Big H, huh{\r}?</font></font></i>

05:49.270 --> 05:50.430
Oh, look at this.

05:50.430 --> 05:53.470
Here you are in your junior
prom outfit with a chick.

05:53.470 --> 05:55.020
She ain't,
she ain't half bad.

05:55.020 --> 05:58.190
Well, uh, I don't do
too bad with the chicks.

05:58.190 --> 06:00.280
I'm Susan.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.280
I'm Richie Cunningham.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.780
And this is
my cousin Phyllis.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.780
Hi.
Hi.

06:09.150 --> 06:11.120
I'll get my flats.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.210
Why don't you tell me
what you want?

06:19.210 --> 06:21.800
Well, why don't you move
a little closer?

06:21.800 --> 06:22.970
(chuckles)

06:22.970 --> 06:24.580
Closer?
Yeah.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.170
Okay, uh, how's this?

06:27.170 --> 06:28.340
I like that.
Okay.

06:28.340 --> 06:30.260
And, uh, this?
That's great.

06:30.260 --> 06:31.340
And this?

06:31.340 --> 06:32.340
I got that one.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.340
Okay, I'll come over here.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.850
And how's, uh, this?
Oh, beautiful.

06:35.850 --> 06:37.310
And this?
Yeah.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.350
And this?
Oh, that's a good picture.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.430
Okay, I'll move
over here.
I got that.

06:40.430 --> 06:42.490
And this?
Oh, you look so great,

06:42.490 --> 06:44.570
Angela... Whoa!

06:47.570 --> 06:49.580
Hey, Richie?
Yeah?

06:49.580 --> 06:50.580
Uh, may I use
your bathroom?

06:50.580 --> 06:53.080
Oh, sure, I got
one of those, too.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.360
Oh, Richie,

06:54.360 --> 06:55.450
I like this place.

06:55.450 --> 06:56.920
I mean,
I love what you've done to it.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.950
I feel comfortable and relaxed.

06:58.950 --> 07:01.450
Just like
a Greenwich Village hideaway.

07:01.450 --> 07:05.790
I can just let my hair down...
and be myself.

07:05.790 --> 07:08.290
Oh, let your hair down.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.880
Well... be back in a flash.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.350

08:19.280 --> 08:21.000
MARION:
I'm telling you about life.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.090
You see, there is a right way
and a wrong way.

08:23.090 --> 08:25.090
Now, the right way
is to finish high school,

08:25.090 --> 08:27.590
and then you go to college, you
fall in love with a nice man--

08:27.590 --> 08:29.590
say, a doctor or lawyer--
and you get married

08:29.590 --> 08:33.100
and you build a home,
put some money in the bank.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.179
Then, you have a baby.

08:35.179 --> 08:38.270
You don't have to do all that
just to have a baby.

08:38.270 --> 08:41.720
Linda Shandley's sister Candy
quit high school to have hers.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.310
She did? I thought she went away
to boarding school.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.310
Well, nonetheless, now, you see,
Candy's is the wrong way.

08:47.310 --> 08:48.810
Now, if this Spike tries

08:48.810 --> 08:50.810
to put his arm around
you in the movie theater,

08:50.810 --> 08:54.320
you just tell him that you
are not that kind of a girl.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.320
What kind of a girl?

08:56.320 --> 09:00.820
Uh, well... the kind of
a girl that you are not.

09:00.820 --> 09:02.740
Oh.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.830
Oh.

09:04.830 --> 09:07.210
Hey, this is my sex talk.

09:07.210 --> 09:10.630
Yes.

09:10.630 --> 09:13.720
FONZIE:
Oh, I remember
that photo, yeah.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.170
What's yours?
(Richie chuckling)

09:15.170 --> 09:17.260
It's a picture of you
with your arm around Potsie.

09:17.260 --> 09:19.260
It was right after,
uh, he saved your life,

09:19.260 --> 09:20.560
and you were his buddy.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.150
Oh, yeah, when he took
me roller-skating.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.650
Well, let me tell
you something, Red.

09:24.650 --> 09:27.650
That is the last time I'm
putting wheels on my heels.

09:40.950 --> 09:43.700
Fonz, Fonz.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.750
Fonz,
it's really terrific.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.200
Now, just come on
down here.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.770
Heyyy.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.040
(skaters approaching)

10:35.890 --> 10:37.890
I'm still standing.

10:37.890 --> 10:39.890
I'm getting good at this.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.060
How come we have
to do all the work?

10:46.060 --> 10:48.060
Why doesn't Fonzie
have to do anything?

10:48.060 --> 10:49.570
'Cause we're afraid of him.

10:49.570 --> 10:51.570
I'm not afraid of him.

10:51.570 --> 10:54.070
Oh, yeah, you really stood up
to him like a man

10:54.070 --> 10:55.660
when you went
and busted up his bike.

10:55.660 --> 10:56.740
Please don't kill me,
Fonz, please don't kill me!

10:56.740 --> 10:58.240
It was an accident.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.360
I was temporarily insane,
I didn't mean it,

11:00.360 --> 11:01.440
I'll never do it again,
I'll move away.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.910
Just let me live.

11:10.950 --> 11:13.960
You know, Fonz,
it takes a very big man

11:13.960 --> 11:16.590
to look you
right in the eye...

11:16.590 --> 11:21.180
...to look you right
in the eye a-and say that.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.680
Well, how about
it, Fonzie?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.680
He's willing to
make it good.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.690
Forgive and
forget, huh?

11:25.690 --> 11:28.690
W-What do you say,
Fonz, pal?

11:31.890 --> 11:34.110
I'm gonna kill him.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.700
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

11:35.700 --> 11:39.700
(all shouting indistinctly)

11:39.700 --> 11:40.700
Okay, is everyone ready?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.700
POTSIE:
Ready, okay.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.200
ALL:
Surprise!

11:45.200 --> 11:47.620
It's me,
the life of the party.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.960
Hey, listen,
Al, I am

11:48.960 --> 11:51.540
very glad you're here because
this young fellow is starved.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.580
Oh, I made these myself.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.660
Oh, don't apologize, Al.

11:54.660 --> 11:55.660
I'll eat anything,
you know.

11:55.660 --> 11:58.630
Oh, yeah, uh,
how about... liver?

11:58.630 --> 12:00.300
Oh, well,
this is good, Fonz.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.640
There's nothing wrong
with this; it's just liver.

12:01.640 --> 12:05.730
(shuddering)

12:05.730 --> 12:08.310
(shuddering moans)

12:08.310 --> 12:10.900
Get that away from me.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.350
Everybody has got weaknesses.

12:13.350 --> 12:14.770
Superman had kryptonite.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.110
Hey, I got over that
if you remember, huh?

13:23.550 --> 13:26.170
Children, thank you so much.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.260
I love these moments.

13:28.260 --> 13:29.760
Well, let's cut the cake, huh?

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
No, no, not yet.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.760
Uh, Joanie and I have
a present for you.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.680
Sit down.
Oh!

13:33.680 --> 13:34.760
(all chattering)

13:34.760 --> 13:36.770
Children, thank you!

13:36.770 --> 13:38.770
Open up those
presents.
Let's see.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.270
Happy anniversary,
Mom and Dad.

13:40.270 --> 13:42.240
Oh, thank you so much.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.490
Listen, something
smells funny.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.580
Marion, our children
gave us a dead fish.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.080
RICHIE:
Oh, it's just Joanie's joke.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.410
Read the note that's with it.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.670
I don't want to touch it.

13:52.670 --> 13:55.080
Mom, it's a weekend
to Lake Whitefish.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.670
Oh!

13:56.670 --> 13:58.620
Thank you,
sweetheart.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.210
Mr. and Mrs. C.,
Mr. and Mrs. C.,

14:00.210 --> 14:02.630
I would be very honored
if you would have this from me.

14:02.630 --> 14:03.710
Oh, thank you, Arthur.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.050
Thank you, Fonzie.
Yeah.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.130
Oh, look,
it's a little collar.

14:08.130 --> 14:10.630
That's a raccoon
tail, Marion.

14:10.630 --> 14:12.130
Oh.
FONZIE:
Hey, no, no, no.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.720
It's off my bike, you know;
it's brought me, like,

14:13.720 --> 14:15.440
years and years
of good luck.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.310
What about your motorcycle jump?

14:17.310 --> 14:20.280
All right, shortcake, that is
the one time I did not have it.

14:22.310 --> 14:24.230
(motorcycle engine revving)

14:39.460 --> 14:42.410
(cheering)

14:42.410 --> 14:44.330
(tires screeching)

14:44.330 --> 14:46.140
(screaming)

14:46.140 --> 14:47.890
Am I dead?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.560
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.180
But I was up and moving
around in no time. Whoa.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.760
That was a rotten plan, huh?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.180
Your trick didn't work.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.770
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:00.770 --> 15:02.650
You'll walk, uh, whenever.

15:02.650 --> 15:03.990
All right, hold it.

15:03.990 --> 15:07.070
Just don't tell anybody
you saw this.

15:07.570 --> 15:08.570
Saw what?

15:08.570 --> 15:10.580
Now it's whenever.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.590
(groans):
Oh.

15:21.590 --> 15:23.590
(screams):
Ooh!

15:23.590 --> 15:24.590
Fonz, you-you're
standing up!

15:24.590 --> 15:26.090
Of course I'm standing up!

15:26.090 --> 15:28.590
What do you think I'm gonna do,
stay on a couch all my life?

15:29.090 --> 15:31.600
(screams):
Oh!

15:31.600 --> 15:34.100
You-you're walking
real good there, Fonz.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.100
Does your knee hurt?

15:35.100 --> 15:38.100
Of course it hurts; I
just had an operation!

15:38.100 --> 15:39.100
Now, listen to me.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.110
I want to tell
you something.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.610
I'm not doing this
because of your dumb plan.

15:42.610 --> 15:44.610
I just wanted to stretch
my legs, that's all.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.610
Yeah, right, Fonz, right.

15:45.610 --> 15:48.110
(groans):
Oh.

15:48.110 --> 15:51.120
All right, now I'm gonna try to
get my cool into shape here.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.880
How'd I do?
You did great, Fonz.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.470
My face, how's my face?

16:09.970 --> 16:10.970
You-You look cool.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.470
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:12.470 --> 16:13.470
I want to tell you something.

16:13.470 --> 16:14.970
It's killing me,
and no one will never know.

16:14.970 --> 16:16.480
Yeah.

16:17.930 --> 16:19.900
Hey, girls, I'm up!

16:21.900 --> 16:24.980
All right, all right,
I admit that the jump

16:24.980 --> 16:27.900
was not one of the smartest
things I ever did in my life,

16:27.900 --> 16:30.490
but I gave my word and a lot
of people were counting on me.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.990
I have never
walked away from

16:31.990 --> 16:34.530
responsibility
in my life, Jack. Whoa.

16:34.530 --> 16:35.910
This girl could shake you up.

16:35.910 --> 16:37.000
I usually
shake them up.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Don't I, Malph?
I usually shake them up.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Little ball,
stay up there.
Did he come in yet?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.500
Excuse me.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.340
Hi, I'm Louisa.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.050
(high-pitched):
Hi. I'm Potsie Weber.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.140
(laughter)

17:00.140 --> 17:02.550
Oh, I'm feeling so good,
let's sing.

17:02.550 --> 17:03.940

18:19.010 --> 18:22.020

18:22.020 --> 18:25.020
No, sweetheart,
I was in Cicero catching an act,

18:25.020 --> 18:26.520

I thought I'd come over.

I haven't even
given you my present.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.940
Oh, thank
you, Howard.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.440
Hey, what'd you
get her, Mr. C.?

20:43.440 --> 20:44.940
Three balloons.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.530
Crackerjack?!

20:47.530 --> 20:48.530
Well, look inside.

(candy rattling)

20:51.500 --> 20:53.090
Oh.

20:53.090 --> 20:54.590
It's a toy
engagement ring.

20:54.590 --> 20:55.590
That is not
funny, Howard.

20:55.590 --> 20:57.340
POTSIE:
Oh, that isn't funny.
You know I...

20:57.340 --> 20:58.420
It's a real one, Marion!

20:58.420 --> 20:59.420
Let me see it.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.430
I've always wanted to have
a real engagement ring.

21:02.430 --> 21:04.930
Here, let me take a look;
I know about these things.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.720
I've been around
enough showgirls.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.550
Well...

21:08.550 --> 21:11.050
I'm sorry to tell you, Marion,
that's the real thing.

(phone ringing)

21:51.890 --> 21:53.400
Phone, Mom.
(chuckles)

21:53.400 --> 21:54.900
Hey, listen, I think
I'd better be going.
Hello.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.900
I have to get to Vegas.
Yes, just
a minute.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.480
Arthur.
What?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.490
This is someone called
the Aloha Pussycats.

22:00.490 --> 22:01.990
Mm-hmm?
In between giggling,

22:01.990 --> 22:03.990
it seems that you are
20 minutes late.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.490
Well, tell them
to relax, man.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.990
It'll be worth it,
right? Hey.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.490
He's on his way.

22:08.490 --> 22:10.580
The Aloha
Pussycats?

22:10.580 --> 22:12.410
You'd, uh, do very
well in Vegas.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.500
Well, thank you very much,
but I got to tell you something.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.340
I do very well everywhere!

22:19.040 --> 22:20.120
Hey, listen,
congrats, huh?

22:20.120 --> 22:22.120
Really, Mrs. C.
Oh, thank you.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.960
Nancy Blansky, huh?

22:23.960 --> 22:25.040
Knock
yourself out.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.550
All right, hey!
I'll see you.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.550
Thanks, Fonz.
Bye, Fonz.

22:27.550 --> 22:29.050
Good-bye.
Oh!

22:29.050 --> 22:31.050
Listen, babies,
I got to go,

22:31.050 --> 22:33.050
but next time
I'm in the neighborhood,

22:33.050 --> 22:34.190
I'll drop in, okay?
Yeah.

22:34.190 --> 22:35.770
Don't wait till
our 40th anniversary.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.310
Uh, so long, kids.

22:37.310 --> 22:39.020
Bye.
So long.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.110
Howie.
Hmm?

22:40.110 --> 22:42.110
One more time.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.900
Oh, Howard, thank you
for that anniversary.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.710
Mm-hmm.

22:53.710 --> 22:55.790
I think they want
to be alone.

22:55.790 --> 22:56.790
Yep.

22:56.790 --> 22:58.290
They're at it again.

22:58.290 --> 23:01.300
We've got the
friskiest parents.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.300
What's your project,
Joanie?

23:03.300 --> 23:04.580
Oh, I wrote a
composition:

23:04.580 --> 23:07.000
"My Parents Are Still Frisky."

23:09.390 --> 23:11.390
Well, what do you
want to do?

23:15.390 --> 23:16.900
Are you getting frisky?

23:16.900 --> 23:18.900
(both laugh)

23:18.900 --> 23:21.400
It's only Thursday!

23:23.400 --> 23:24.570
Oh, boy.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.440
Every Saturday,
it's the same thing.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.580
Come on, sweetheart,
let's go to sleep.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.580
I should clean up.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.090
Oh, it can wait
till tomorrow.

23:42.090 --> 23:44.090
You know, we were
doing the same thing

23:44.090 --> 23:46.210
20 years ago tonight.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.290
Mmm.

23:48.290 --> 23:49.800
Only then, we were running.
