WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:05.104
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Do you love her more than us?

00:05.106 --> 00:06.672
Do you, mother?
(gasps)

00:06.674 --> 00:07.773
What are you doing here?

00:07.775 --> 00:09.475
You cannot stay at court.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.610
Narcisse has nothing on
either of you, not any more.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.645
Run him through for
treason against his king.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.548
Jacob:
<i>Assassins managed</i>
<i>to enter the castle.</i>

00:18.184 --> 00:20.519
Protestant assassins?
Tell me we didn't fund

00:20.521 --> 00:22.621
An assassination on our king!

00:22.623 --> 00:24.056
They said

00:24.058 --> 00:26.158
That you were untouched.
I lied.

00:27.060 --> 00:27.760
I was raped.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.795
This is my fault.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.231
Find the men who did this
to me and kill them.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.111
(man shouts outside)

00:50.150 --> 00:51.550
Take as many
as the dungeon can hold.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.751
Leave the rest
chained up outside

00:52.753 --> 00:54.086
Till we can find
a place for them.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.526
All the roads
are sealed off.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.294
These men were caught
trying to flee.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.263
What of the man
called severin?

01:04.265 --> 01:05.431
His lands are deserted

01:05.433 --> 01:08.100
But I'm having them
watched day and night.

01:08.102 --> 01:11.103
Who saw him?
Who heard him called by name?

01:11.105 --> 01:12.438
One of the guards.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.273
I'll question him.
Maybe he knows something else.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.308
No, I already did. The one name
was all that he overheard.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.776
Guard:
Move along.
Question everyone

01:17.778 --> 01:19.178
And anyone who might know
this man severin.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.813
Use any means necessary--

01:20.815 --> 01:23.615
The rack, the wheel,
I don't care.
Francis,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.584
You seem shaken,
but they failed.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.819
You're all right.

01:26.821 --> 01:29.321
Mary is all right.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.824
There is nothing small
about an attack on the king.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.258
Of course.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.161
What about narcisse?
Did you get to him?

01:36.163 --> 01:38.197
No. No, he disappeared.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.765
But I will find him.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.267
CondÃ©.
I was going to visit my brother

01:42.269 --> 01:43.535
In navarre, but I turned back

01:43.537 --> 01:45.437
As soon as I heard the news.
Where's mary?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.140
She's fine-- getting
some much-needed rest.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.541
Thank god.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.544
Francis, you must know
my loyalty lies with you.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.214
I do. But you're
also a protestant.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.682
You know the leader
of this movement.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.685
If he is behind this,
he will be found and hanged.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.587
And if he wasn't,
he needs to cooperate,

02:01.589 --> 02:03.122
Help us find
the conspirators.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.756
I'll try to find him.

02:13.366 --> 02:16.301
What's mary doing here?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.704
She's looking
for her rapist.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.806
And if you don't catch him,
that's what she'll be doing

02:20.808 --> 02:22.207
For the rest of her life--

02:22.209 --> 02:24.143
In every room and
in every crowd.

02:27.413 --> 02:30.149
Mary...
(startled gasp)

02:30.151 --> 02:31.617
I'm sorry.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.252
Please come inside.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.454
He's not here.
But all of these men

02:35.456 --> 02:37.623
Will be questioned and
one of them will lead us to him.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.158
And the other men, too.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.425
The ones who stood there

02:40.427 --> 02:41.927
And would have done
the same to me, or worse.

02:41.929 --> 02:46.231
Yes.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.332
Mary, it would be
foolish of me to ask you

02:47.334 --> 02:48.667
To try not to think about it,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.903
But I urge you
to get some rest.

02:50.905 --> 02:54.273
I can't close my eyes
without seeing them.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.807
And the next hours
are crucial--

02:55.809 --> 02:57.509
Every minute that passes makes
their capture less likely.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.178
They won't get away.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.679
I will find the men responsible.
They could be

03:00.681 --> 03:02.714
Miles away by now.
It doesn't matter
where they are,

03:02.716 --> 03:05.250
Mary, I will hunt them
to the ends of the earth.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.290
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

03:14.194 --> 03:16.495
â™ª they all need something

03:16.497 --> 03:21.366
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

03:21.368 --> 03:24.903
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

03:24.905 --> 03:28.707
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

03:28.709 --> 03:30.242
â™ª

03:39.319 --> 03:40.519
Castleroy:
<i>Where are you going?</i>

03:40.521 --> 03:43.255
Morning mass.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.258
Come with me.
Greer, I go to services
now, not mass.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.693
After all that's happened?
It was the act

03:47.695 --> 03:50.729
Of a small group
of violent radicals.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.798
You gave money and they
used it to fund their crimes.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.466
I gave money for a school.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.702
What difference
does it make?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.537
If your involvement
comes to light,

03:58.539 --> 04:00.539
You will hang for treason.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.507
They tried to kill our king.

04:02.509 --> 04:06.278
You must separate yourself
from this faith

04:06.280 --> 04:07.779
And you must
do it immediately.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.314
I can't do that.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.821
You are going down
a dangerous path

04:15.823 --> 04:17.489
And you are
dragging me with you.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.957
I beg of you:

04:18.959 --> 04:21.460
Change course.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.733
What can I do for you?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.335
Are you cold?

04:30.337 --> 04:32.404
I'll fetch you a blanket.

04:34.507 --> 04:39.378
I should have known
those weren't our guards.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.981
Mary, you were startled
in the dead of night.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.550
There were three
armed men against you.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.719
Please don't
torment yourself.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.689
I'm so sorry
that this happened.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.925
That my choices brought
this violence into our home.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.029
Don't blame yourself
for the actions of evil people.

04:57.031 --> 05:00.432
We've disagreed
about tolerance, but

05:00.434 --> 05:03.068
You were just doing
what you believed was right,

05:03.070 --> 05:06.838
What you thought
was best for France.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.740
No.

05:08.742 --> 05:12.511
I wasn't doing
what I believed was right

05:12.513 --> 05:14.713
Or what I thought was best.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.020
I made choices...

05:22.022 --> 05:24.389
Under pressure from another.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.059
I was being blackmailed.

05:27.061 --> 05:30.395
Blackmailed? For what?

05:32.598 --> 05:35.767
I killed my father at the joust.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.706
He was a threat
to France, to you.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.007
Oh, my god.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.508
It was regicide.

05:43.510 --> 05:47.612
Francis, who
found out the truth?

05:47.614 --> 05:50.682
Narcisse.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.019
All the hard-line choices

05:54.021 --> 05:55.654
Favoring catholics,

05:55.656 --> 05:57.956
All the violence
that you allowed...

05:57.958 --> 06:01.026
Why didn't you tell me
what he was doing to you?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.795
Because if it ever
came to light...

06:06.399 --> 06:08.367
...You needed to be able
to deny any knowledge

06:08.369 --> 06:10.902
Or involvement-- I couldn't
let you be implicated

06:10.904 --> 06:12.571
For what I did.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.806
I kept thinking
that I'd find a way out,

06:14.808 --> 06:17.609
But things got so bloody,
so awful, and...

06:17.611 --> 06:19.611
The lies and mistakes

06:19.613 --> 06:21.146
Kept piling up.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.714
Till last night--

06:22.716 --> 06:24.649
I found a way out.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.118
I found montgomery.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.786
Where is he?

06:29.922 --> 06:32.624
You killed him.
I had to.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.460
I have done terrible things
to protect us.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.129
And I have lied to you

06:37.131 --> 06:39.564
Time and time again,
to protect you.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.567
Protect me?

06:45.138 --> 06:47.606
I know the events of last night
can never be undone,

06:47.608 --> 06:50.075
But they will pay
with their lives.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.777
I will kill them.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.413
Every last person
who brought us to this.

06:54.415 --> 06:58.116
And once they're gone,
we will come back from this.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.752
And I will never
let anyone hurt you again.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.722
(knocking on door)

07:03.724 --> 07:05.690
(door opens)
francis,

07:05.692 --> 07:07.926
You need to come outside.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.162
It's freezing.
You can't leave us out here.

07:10.164 --> 07:13.198
When the sun goes down,
we'll die-- take us inside!

07:13.200 --> 07:15.834
More prisoners are coming in,
but the dungeons are filling up.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.736
They're right--
it's too cold,

07:17.738 --> 07:19.037
Many won't survive the night.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.839
Many here didn't
survive the last.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.541
Guards and servants
were killed,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.776
And they got in because
they thought us vulnerable.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.178
Against the wall!

07:26.180 --> 07:28.013
I wanted to be one kind of king,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.781
And then I was
forced to be another.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.783
Now I can't go back.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.185
Francis...
What is needed now

07:33.187 --> 07:35.454
Is a king to be feared.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.556
And not just for the prisoners,
but for all of France,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.925
And, by god,
I will give them one.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.462
So that this
never happens again.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.564
(coughing)

07:45.566 --> 07:47.699
Let them freeze.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.705
Thank you.
Mary, they told us

07:53.707 --> 07:55.040
You were
in your old chambers.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.576
Why are they
moving your things in?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.744
I'm going to be
staying here for a while.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.648
Why?
It's because

08:03.650 --> 08:06.785
Of the attacks
last night. Um...

08:06.787 --> 08:08.687
I can't stay
in my old rooms anymore.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.156
Well, they told us
you were fine, that your

08:11.158 --> 08:13.558
Guards were killed, but the men
fled before they could get in.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.560
Uh, that was a lie I told.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.229
And one you
will have to tell, too.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.564
The truth is...

08:19.566 --> 08:22.000
Those men broke into my chambers

08:22.002 --> 08:23.635
And I was raped.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.804
Dear god...

08:29.208 --> 08:31.810
I'm-I'm still in some pain and
I'd prefer not to be touched.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.715
They beat me and one
held me down while the other...

08:36.717 --> 08:38.717
These men--

08:38.719 --> 08:40.519
Were they captured?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.153
Uh, no, they got away.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.522
<i>He</i> got away.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.724
So I will be
staying here,

08:45.726 --> 08:47.893
Under guard, for a while.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.195
I cannot hear any
talk of an heir,

08:50.197 --> 08:52.097
At all, not from you,
not from anyone.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.199
Not until I'm sure
that any pregnancy,

08:54.201 --> 08:55.834
Any child isn't...

08:55.836 --> 08:58.203
Of course.
We'll make sure

08:58.205 --> 09:00.305
No one asks.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.641
I'm not ashamed
of what happened to me.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.276
I was wronged by

09:04.278 --> 09:06.745
Evil men, but this was
an act of war

09:06.747 --> 09:08.747
And hatred against the monarchy,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.749
Which is why no one
can ever know.
Mary...

09:10.751 --> 09:12.584
We understand, but
right now we don't care

09:12.586 --> 09:14.019
About the monarchy.
We're your friends

09:14.021 --> 09:15.854
And we care about you.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.255
I'm so sorry.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.660
What-what can we do?

09:21.662 --> 09:24.596
Francis will make this right.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.231
He will find those men
and he will

09:26.233 --> 09:28.300
Slay them and it will be over.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.104
May I have a word
with you, please?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.979
I know about
what happened to mary.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.849
Francis, I'm so sorry.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.217
So am I.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.119
I can't help but think

09:48.121 --> 09:49.955
If I'd helped you weaken
narcisse earlier,

09:49.957 --> 09:51.189
Things might have
gone differently.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.257
The vatican, the edict...

09:52.259 --> 09:53.959
You are not responsible.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.161
I am.
(sighs) we can't

09:56.163 --> 09:58.063
Undo the choices we made,

09:58.065 --> 09:59.631
But we can use all our energy,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.266
All our power, to avenge mary.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.268
Which is why I won't rest
until I do.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.970
Francis, I heard

10:04.972 --> 10:07.072
Narcisse fled.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.074
I might have an idea where to.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.310
Once, he mentioned a kind
of oasis for him,

10:12.312 --> 10:15.080
A villa out
in the countryside.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.214
I don't think he'd remember
mentioning it to me,

10:16.216 --> 10:17.215
Which is why...
Which is why

10:17.217 --> 10:18.783
He might be there.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.890
Thank you.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.693
I know narcisse deserves
whatever he gets,

10:28.695 --> 10:31.930
But after last night, you will
need nobles at your side.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.365
Ask yourself

10:33.367 --> 10:37.302
Whether narcisse is more
valuable to you dead or alive.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.939
(knocking on door)

10:45.111 --> 10:47.379
Leith.

10:47.381 --> 10:50.015
Where's your husband?

10:50.017 --> 10:52.384
We came here when we
heard of the attack,

10:52.386 --> 10:54.252
But he had business
with some nobles.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.287
Do you know
what my orders are now?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.289
To round up every known
protestant for questioning,

10:58.291 --> 11:00.759
Even torture. It's a witch hunt.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.160
Oh, god.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.328
Does mary know
castleroy is a protestant?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.096
Yes.
Will she protect you?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.098
Both of you?
No.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.768
I-I can't turn to her,
not this time.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.236
Then you need to leave.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.304
Before he is named
by one of the others.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.441
Oh, this can't be happening.
It is, greer.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.944
And you warned me, didn't you?

11:19.946 --> 11:22.013
That I was taking an
enormous risk with a man

11:22.015 --> 11:24.315
I originally turned to,
because he offered me safety.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.286
I feel more for him
than gratitude.
I'm glad.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.423
But now, if you love him,
then you need to leave with him.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.892
You need to get as far away
from here as possible.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.296
(sighs)

11:38.298 --> 11:40.298
Bash:
Francis.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.433
There's been a riot
in the south keep.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.134
Some prisoners
heard a rumor

11:43.136 --> 11:44.803
You were going to let
them freeze to death.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.971
They panicked and two
guards were killed.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.206
Hang the men responsible.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.041
We don't yet know
who started it

11:50.043 --> 11:51.276
Or who dealt the killing blow.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.445
Defiant even in captivity.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.013
Catherine:
Because they foresee death

11:55.015 --> 11:56.381
By your command.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.150
Are you defending them?
Of course not.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.720
I'm only advising you to choose
your next move carefully.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.054
The time has
come to either

12:03.056 --> 12:05.090
Dole out mercy
or to crush them all.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.391
Whichever you choose,

12:06.393 --> 12:08.326
There is no turning back.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.261
Terror worked
for you and father.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.230
It kept
the realm safe.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.765
But at a price, francis.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.233
How many men
are in the south keep?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.335
A dozen or so.
Hang them all.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.369
Here in the courtyard,
so the others

12:18.371 --> 12:19.804
Can see what fate has in store

12:19.806 --> 12:21.406
For those who would rise
against us.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.874
Hyah!
(horse neighs)

12:36.455 --> 12:39.190
(harpsichord playing)

12:52.805 --> 12:55.440
Claude, please
leave this room.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.941
There are over 100 rooms
in this castle

12:56.943 --> 12:58.843
And you need this one?

12:58.845 --> 13:00.111
(playing harpsichord)

13:00.113 --> 13:01.446
Get out of here.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.480
Now.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.548
Get out. Now.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.415
Go to hell.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.852
(exhales)

13:09.021 --> 13:11.790
You're out of your mind.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.860
Leave her be.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.195
Leave her be. She's but a child.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.097
Henriette:
She hated us.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.799
Have you forgotten?

13:21.367 --> 13:24.035
I remember everything.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.304
How did we die, mother?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.873
She suffocated you.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.409
<i>Those flowers</i>
<i>from claude's dress, the ones</i>

13:31.411 --> 13:33.545
<i>You'd been pulling at.</i>
<i>No!</i>

13:33.547 --> 13:37.382
She put one...
In each of your throats.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.484
And then you lied.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.821
I blamed it on an illness.

13:49.395 --> 13:53.064
She was my daughter,
and you were both gone.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.433
Choose us this time.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.002
There's no choice.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.439
You are both dead.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.007
Aah! My wrist.
Please.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.242
We are here.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.443
Don't you feel us?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.979
Do to claude
what she did to us.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.214
I can't.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.983
Blame me. She was only five.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.418
If you don't do it,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.253
Then we will.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.621
And she will suffer.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.491
We promise.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.093
(moans)

14:22.095 --> 14:24.195
Jacob:
<i>Hugo, where are you?</i>

14:24.197 --> 14:28.032
This place is empty.
Silent as death.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.502
If this hugo funneled money to
the conspirators as you say,

14:31.504 --> 14:34.205
Perhaps he fled with them.
Hugo worked for me.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.408
I know he only aided
those men out of fear.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.611
Perhaps the king's guards
took him.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.219
He didn't give them
the chance.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.455
Lord castleroy,
you have been named
greer! Get back!

14:50.457 --> 14:51.890
By another suspect
in the attempted murder

14:51.892 --> 14:53.191
Of king francis.
Greer: Please, no,

14:53.193 --> 14:54.292
He's a good man.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.664
You can't do this. I am one

14:59.666 --> 15:02.100
Of the queen's ladies!
Greer! Don't
put yourself at risk,

15:02.102 --> 15:03.568
Do you hear me?
I'll be all right.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.336
I'll be all right!

15:14.313 --> 15:16.381
The letter I asked you
to deliver to mary last night,

15:16.383 --> 15:17.382
Was it delivered?

15:17.384 --> 15:18.583
I don't think so.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.584
The servant I charged

15:19.586 --> 15:21.052
With delivering the letter

15:21.054 --> 15:22.253
Was killed
outside mary's chambers.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.222
He never reached the queen.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.423
I see.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.557
Do you want it back, my lord?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.693
We could take it
from the body.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.396
No. Let the man rest in peace.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.097
Did the assassins

15:33.099 --> 15:34.666
Really make it that close
to the royal chambers?

15:34.668 --> 15:36.367
Lord condÃ©.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.239
I just found out how
close the attackers came--

15:41.241 --> 15:43.608
Right to your door.
Are you sure you're all right?

15:44.576 --> 15:47.211
Yes, I'm fine.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.613
You were lucky.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.983
Francis asked me
to bring back some information,

15:51.985 --> 15:53.251
But I can't find him.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.619
What information?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.287
He's left the castle.
If it's about the attackers,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.456
There's no time to lose.
Share it with me.

16:01.261 --> 16:04.462
The man who aided
them with money, he...

16:04.464 --> 16:06.164
He hanged himself.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.699
To avoid torture.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.267
I won't give up searching,

16:09.269 --> 16:11.135
But anyone guilty has
either been rounded up,

16:11.137 --> 16:12.503
Hiding, or on the run
if they managed to get out

16:12.505 --> 16:14.339
Before the roads
were blocked by the guards.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.743
Louis...

16:20.346 --> 16:22.547
...Did the man who funded
the attackers have a wife?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.682
Yes.
Take me to her.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.151
I could have her brought in.
To be tortured?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.519
We don't have the time,
and people in pain

16:28.521 --> 16:30.054
Will say anything.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.390
I need the truth,
names, information

16:32.392 --> 16:34.625
To find the men who...

16:34.627 --> 16:37.729
Are most responsible,
and I need it now.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.731
No, it's too dangerous.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.366
It's worth the risk.

16:42.468 --> 16:46.237
Louis, these men broke
into my home.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.240
It's worth the risk.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.177
My lover in brussels had
a penchant for gold leaf.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.713
Once, he had me wrapped
in it, all but my...

16:55.715 --> 16:57.315
(laughter)

16:57.317 --> 17:00.018
I would like a word alone
with my daughter.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.519
Your majesty.
Your majesty.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.590
What is it now, mother?

17:05.592 --> 17:07.358
Would you like this room, too?
Claude.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.294
It's not safe for you, here,
in the castle.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.130
I have done
all that I could.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.365
I don't know how much longer
I can keep you from harm.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.036
Keep me from harm?
You struck me.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.271
Listen to me,

17:20.273 --> 17:22.440
There are other things
to fear.
What things?

17:23.510 --> 17:26.677
To take you anywhere
you want to go.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.414
Rome, paris...
I'm perfectly happy here.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.583
Please... Please, claude,
I am begging you.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.352
You know, for the longest time,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.421
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.489
But there's something wrong
with you.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.225
I am finished asking
why you want me gone.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.661
Please...

17:52.838 --> 17:55.239
I don't need your money.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.775
I have far more
value to francis.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.445
You're a relic
who's outlived her usefulness.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.679
I...

18:01.681 --> 18:03.448
Am the future.
If you don't leave

18:03.450 --> 18:06.317
This castle, you will leave me
no choice but...

18:06.319 --> 18:08.252
Do not threaten me.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.687
I swear,

18:09.689 --> 18:11.289
If you dare lay a hand
on me again,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.624
You will woefully regret it.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.798
I'd be careful threatening
catherine like that.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.334
She's more deadly than
you give her credit for.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.436
Lady kenna.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.439
Lurking on the sidelines,
privy to family squabbles.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.274
Is that how you got
into my father's bed?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.542
I'm trying
to help you.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.244
The women in this castle
have it hard enough

18:33.246 --> 18:34.278
Without us turning
on each other.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.780
And you worry for me.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.548
I have no idea what's happening
between you and your mother...

18:37.550 --> 18:40.184
She hates me, and you're
enjoying that, aren't you?

18:40.186 --> 18:41.486
I'm trying not to,
but you're being such a spiteful

18:41.488 --> 18:44.422
Little shrew.
And what are you?

18:44.424 --> 18:45.723
You're nothing.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.758
Catherine
is still my mother.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.494
We have a bond.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.463
And if you know anything
about her, you'll know this:

18:52.465 --> 18:54.265
She will do anything

18:54.267 --> 18:55.700
For her blood.

18:58.570 --> 19:01.305
Don't bother.
There's nowhere to run.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.607
My men are outside.
You're surrounded.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.742
And there's no blackmail
to save you now.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.544
Get up.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.746
I won't fight you.

19:08.748 --> 19:12.483
But know that I deeply regret
the pressure

19:12.485 --> 19:15.453
I put you under.
I see now that there is nothing

19:15.455 --> 19:18.723
More dangerous than men
who have nothing left to lose.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.525
Shut up.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.827
I heard about the protestants
you've already slaughtered.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.398
There is no getting
off this road now.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.900
They hate you.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.470
I know you hate me, too,

19:32.472 --> 19:33.871
For everything I've done
to you, for making you

19:33.873 --> 19:36.574
A different kind of king,
but that is who you are now.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.550
You need me.
Nobody needs you.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.518
You need me alive because
I have changed my will.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.687
You kill me
and all my lands, my armies,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.689
My gold go
to the protestant cause.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.958
You kill me,
you hand them everything I have,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.194
And they will use it
against you.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.900
It is a new France,

20:02.902 --> 20:05.536
And I shall be loyal
to you, I swear.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.576
I see you will resort
to anything to stay alive.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.611
(groans)

20:13.613 --> 20:15.980
You'll soon find out there are
fates worse than death.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.788
This way.
My husband hanged himself
to avoid the king's guards.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.723
They'll come for me soon.
You have to get me
out of France!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.658
I can't help you
if you don't help me.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.628
I need information on
the men that carried
out this attack.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.697
Do you know
where they are?
If I talk to you, they'll know.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.665
They'll kill me.
Mary:
No, they won't.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.401
Your majesty.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.804
If you help us find these men,

20:39.806 --> 20:42.006
They will never hurt you

20:42.008 --> 20:43.741
Or anyone else again,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.676
And this manhunt
against your brethren will stop.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.279
My husband--
this wasn't his doing.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.648
They forced him to give them
money for weapons,

20:50.650 --> 20:53.251
Men...
I believe you, and you must
trust in me, as well.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.652
I will ensure your safety.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.822
What do you know
about a man called severin?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.759
He was just a farmer.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.328
His son was a minister,
the one they strung up.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.831
And by "they," you mean us,
the royals.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.934
(thunder rumbling)
that's when severin
joined the radicals.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.404
After the attack at the castle,
he and two others

21:13.406 --> 21:16.307
Came back for money, enough
to get them out of the country.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.343
They threatened to kill me
if hugo didn't help them.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.479
Your husband paid them
to save your life?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.848
Sandrine:
But he needed time
to gather the funds.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.717
He planned to leave the money
waiting for them

21:26.719 --> 21:28.686
At a peasant house
north of here.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.055
(thunder rumbles)

21:31.057 --> 21:32.723
We need to head back,
tell francis.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.592
We're not going back.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.327
What?
The house is closer
to us than the castle is.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.696
If we leave now,
we might be able

21:38.698 --> 21:40.531
To catch these men
before they escape.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.700
"we?" mary, I'm not taking you
anywhere near that house.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.536
There's no reason for
you to endanger yourself.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.972
I can identify them.
How?

21:49.408 --> 21:52.977
You saw their faces?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.913
Yes. I-I was huddled
in a doorway

21:55.915 --> 21:58.549
When I saw three men
trying to make their escape.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.085
Louis, our only chance
of catching them

22:01.087 --> 22:02.920
Is if we leave now.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.855
But without guards...
There's no time.

22:04.857 --> 22:08.759
If we miss our chance, I won't
be able to forgive myself.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.761
Not to mention,

22:10.763 --> 22:14.365
There are three of them.
You're going to need help.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.434
Mary, you're not
even armed...

22:16.436 --> 22:18.869
Good lord.
We need to capture them alive.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.504
I want them questioned,

22:20.506 --> 22:22.740
And I want them
publicly hanged for treason.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.476
(sighs)

22:25.478 --> 22:29.380
I'll take out their legs, then
we drag them back to court.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.848
Together.

22:32.484 --> 22:35.686
(thunder rumbling)

22:41.126 --> 22:43.394
What are you doing here?

22:43.396 --> 22:45.830
I've been a
bit on edge.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.565
(sighs)

22:47.567 --> 22:49.800
There's so much tension
in the region,

22:49.802 --> 22:51.569
And I have taken it out on you.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.504
You've always
taken it out on me.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.139
Whatever it is,

22:55.141 --> 22:56.907
Whatever ails you.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.542
I know. I'm sorry.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.845
You weren't like that
with anyone else,

23:00.847 --> 23:02.380
Even your other daughters.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.781
You know you favor boys.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.015
Claude,

23:05.017 --> 23:07.017
I'm trying to apologize.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.452
What for?

23:08.454 --> 23:10.921
(thunder rumbling)

23:10.923 --> 23:13.491
For the wrongs
that I 've done.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.427
I love you.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.562
I always have.

23:18.564 --> 23:23.701
I don't want you to suffer
more than you already have.

23:25.404 --> 23:31.442
â™ª you're my star...

23:31.444 --> 23:34.412
I haven't been much
of a mother to you,

23:34.414 --> 23:38.949
And I thought it was about time
I behaved as such.

23:41.653 --> 23:44.088
â™ª then I'll follow...

23:44.090 --> 23:45.990
You know, I can't help but think

23:45.992 --> 23:47.925
Things would be different
between us

23:47.927 --> 23:50.127
If I'd been kinder

23:50.129 --> 23:51.796
To you from the start,

23:51.798 --> 23:53.964
When you were young.
(thunder rumbling)

23:53.966 --> 23:57.601
Forgive me.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.703
For all that I have done.

23:59.705 --> 24:03.841
â™ª I...

24:03.843 --> 24:08.212
â™ª I'll never be afraid

24:10.882 --> 24:12.516
â™ª oh, oh, ooh

24:12.518 --> 24:16.654
â™ª I...

24:17.622 --> 24:20.124
Forgive me.

24:33.572 --> 24:37.608
Your majesty, I've come
to ask something of you.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.077
Leave us.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.546
There is a prisoner
being held

24:42.548 --> 24:44.615
For questioning
in the dungeons--

24:44.617 --> 24:45.983
Lord castleroy.
I know this.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.618
I know
that he is greer's husband.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.487
I've come to ask you
to set him free.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.988
He was named
by another prisoner.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.623
Sharing the same faith,
that is all.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.091
I know castleroy.
He is not your enemy.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.827
There's no way he had
any part in this attack.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.763
He was brought in
for questioning.
People are dying

24:59.765 --> 25:02.833
While they await what you
so politely call "questioning."

25:05.036 --> 25:08.939
Forgive me? But I was
a soldier at your side.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.774
When you saved my life.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.176
When we saw so much death.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.044
To feel its grip,

25:14.046 --> 25:16.881
To push back an enemy,
to wonder how much force

25:16.883 --> 25:18.916
Is too much.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.718
If some small part of you

25:20.720 --> 25:24.088
Is wondering that now,
I'm offering you a way out.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.056
(scoffs)

25:26.058 --> 25:28.726
A chance to show mercy
with one man.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.860
I can't.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.729
You can.

25:31.731 --> 25:34.632
When you took my lands away,
you said that

25:34.634 --> 25:36.734
You'd make it up to me one day.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.068
Well, this is that day.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.204
I want repayment.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.306
Let castleroy go.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.009
Leith, are you sure this is how
you want me to repay you?

25:46.811 --> 25:50.981
(distant groans,
water dripping)

25:50.983 --> 25:52.816
(praying quietly)

25:52.818 --> 25:54.118
Lord castleroy...

25:54.120 --> 25:55.986
Come with me.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.590
(door creaks open,
chains jangling)

25:59.592 --> 26:01.659
(door creaks shut)

26:01.661 --> 26:03.961
You're free.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.131
(sighs)

26:07.133 --> 26:09.133
(chains jangling)

26:09.135 --> 26:10.634
Leith, uh...

26:11.870 --> 26:14.572
Thank you.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.309
Leith:
Oh, you're

26:18.311 --> 26:20.077
Still in danger here.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.313
People know who you are,
so, whatever you do,

26:22.315 --> 26:24.915
Don't come back.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.635
(door creaking)

26:44.637 --> 26:45.936
They're not here.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.738
Mary:
Are we too late?

26:47.740 --> 26:48.706
(horse neighs in distance)

26:48.708 --> 26:50.007
Man:
This is the place.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.942
(hoofbeats)

26:51.944 --> 26:53.243
They're coming.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.378
Hide, mary.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.380
(horse neighs in distance)

26:56.382 --> 26:58.916
(door creaks open,
wind whistling)

27:02.921 --> 27:05.623
Aye, hugo kept his word.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.957
The money's here.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.792
(coins jingling)

27:08.794 --> 27:10.127
(mary grunts, severin groans)

27:10.129 --> 27:11.629
Who in the hell?

27:11.631 --> 27:13.697
(groaning)

27:21.306 --> 27:23.807
(groaning):
Dear god, no.

27:24.943 --> 27:25.976
(man groaning)

27:25.978 --> 27:28.646
It is you.
Yeah.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.947
I remember you.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.683
I make no apologies.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.018
You deserved what I gave you.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.088
You savage!

27:42.927 --> 27:46.797
You will be hanged
for what you did to me.

27:46.799 --> 27:50.234
You will suffer and die,
and I will live.

27:50.236 --> 27:54.171
In a hundred years, as queen,
I will be remembered,

27:54.173 --> 27:55.839
And your name will be forgotten.

27:55.841 --> 27:59.376
You'll see that you are erased
from history.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.346
And god have mercy on your soul.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.948
Damn your pity
and your king!

28:04.950 --> 28:06.817
God will forgive me.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.786
He will grant
me absolution

28:08.788 --> 28:10.187
From the fire.

28:12.891 --> 28:13.824
Mary...!

28:14.926 --> 28:17.127
(severin screaming)

28:21.900 --> 28:23.867
Kill them...

28:23.869 --> 28:26.770
And let them burn
with their sins.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.906
No, my lord,
I beg you-- aah!

28:57.936 --> 29:00.104
Does francis know
what happened?

29:00.106 --> 29:04.308
Yes. So does catherine
and my ladies.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.044
What happened to me can never
become public knowledge.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.012
It would weaken us.
Mary...

29:09.014 --> 29:10.814
You can trust me.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.484
I know.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.986
We should keep moving.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.821
You're nearly home.

29:17.823 --> 29:20.224
Mary:
Am I?

29:20.226 --> 29:23.127
Mary?
I thought that

29:23.129 --> 29:26.196
By killing those men
I could find my way back

29:26.198 --> 29:29.767
To my old life with francis.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.502
But how can I?

29:31.504 --> 29:35.005
It's done,
and it can't be undone.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.474
What they did to me,
the events that led us here,

29:37.476 --> 29:40.043
So far from where we began.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.879
That's not true.

29:41.881 --> 29:45.082
Look at me, mary.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.918
France is your home now;
your country.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.120
And you are still its queen.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.423
Your people need you.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.093
(footsteps approaching,
bell tolling)

29:57.929 --> 29:59.863
Hello, claude.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.064
Hello, bash.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.933
Did you know

30:02.935 --> 30:06.203
48 hours ago, I had
not one but two suitors

30:06.205 --> 30:07.571
Vying for my hand in marriage.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.340
And now I have none.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.042
Bad luck.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.077
You're still here.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.246
Good bash.

30:16.248 --> 30:19.249
Dependable bash.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.518
Such hands...

30:21.520 --> 30:24.154
Such fingers.

30:26.224 --> 30:29.426
How drunk are you?

30:31.963 --> 30:34.364
You're burning up.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.071
(sighs)

30:41.073 --> 30:44.274
You warned me and I...
I didn't listen.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.443
I won't make that
mistake in the future.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.213
In our future.

30:53.117 --> 30:55.986
Greer, you are leaving <i>with</i> me.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.090
I can't.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.558
Mary needs me now
more than ever.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.227
Besides...

31:03.229 --> 31:05.629
If we both run now,
just after your release,

31:05.631 --> 31:08.065
You'll look guilty
of something more,

31:08.067 --> 31:10.167
Something undiscovered.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.169
But if I stay...

31:12.171 --> 31:13.570
Greer, no.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.139
I can protect you
from suspicion.

31:16.141 --> 31:19.209
Take your children
and go somewhere safe.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.144
I'll make up an excuse
for your absence.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.647
My permanent absence?

31:23.649 --> 31:25.215
Please don't say that.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.186
I love you.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.022
I know.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.391
And I pray I'll see you again.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.202
Mary, I've been looking for you
everywhere.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.237
We've caught and executed

31:47.239 --> 31:50.274
Nine of the conspirators
whose role in the...

31:50.276 --> 31:52.242
Attack was confirmed,

31:52.244 --> 31:54.044
But severin...

31:54.046 --> 31:55.279
He's dead.

31:57.282 --> 31:58.982
As are his accomplices.

31:58.984 --> 32:00.250
You were wise to use condÃ©.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.518
He helped me find them.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.221
You killed them?
Together?

32:04.223 --> 32:05.355
There wasn't time--
I had to act.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.957
I didn't want them to escape.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.059
But you can release
the rest of the prisoners,

32:09.061 --> 32:10.193
Francis.

32:10.195 --> 32:12.095
It's over.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.135
(voice breaking):
It's over.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.938
Mary, no.

32:23.074 --> 32:25.275
(crying)

32:29.013 --> 32:31.615
This notion that we could

32:31.617 --> 32:35.185
Put the pieces back together.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.321
I wanted to believe
that we could.

32:37.323 --> 32:41.191
That we just needed to find
these men and punish them.

32:41.193 --> 32:44.361
But now I realize...

32:44.363 --> 32:47.731
I can't change the fact that...

32:50.068 --> 32:54.071
You blame me for
what happened.

32:54.073 --> 32:58.408
I know it's irrational, but...

32:58.410 --> 33:01.712
It feels forever linked to you.

33:01.714 --> 33:04.481
And to us.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.984
Mary, I was...

33:06.986 --> 33:09.653
Desperately trying
to save your life.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.621
What would we have
done differently

33:11.623 --> 33:13.290
If you'd known the truth?

33:13.292 --> 33:16.393
For me to put you in
that kind of danger?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.395
I'm not sure.

33:18.397 --> 33:21.498
I don't know if it would have
gone differently

33:21.500 --> 33:24.434
Or better, but you never
gave us a chance.

33:25.436 --> 33:28.472
And now we'll never know.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.341
(sniffles)

33:31.343 --> 33:35.345
I've had some time to think.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.350
I believe that we should lead
separate lives.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.489
What does that mean?

33:45.491 --> 33:49.259
That we will continue to work
together as king and queen,

33:49.261 --> 33:51.328
But that I will be
your wife

33:51.330 --> 33:52.429
In name only.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.134
I can't do that.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.270
I won't.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.440
We wouldn't be the first people
in history to do so.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.208
If you're talking
about my parents,

34:05.210 --> 34:07.511
We are nothing like them.

34:07.513 --> 34:11.715
I would do anything
for you, mary.

34:11.717 --> 34:16.420
I love you and you love me.

34:16.422 --> 34:20.390
And look where that love
has brought us.

34:23.461 --> 34:26.163
(shuddering breath)

34:31.436 --> 34:32.769
(door creaks open)

34:35.339 --> 34:38.408
I thought about throwing you
in with the protestants.

34:38.410 --> 34:42.079
They'd rip a fine catholic lord
like you limb from limb.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.713
And then I realized

34:43.715 --> 34:47.184
I have better use for you alive.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.453
You cost me

34:49.455 --> 34:53.090
More than you could
possibly imagine,

34:53.092 --> 34:55.459
But your debt will be paid.

34:55.461 --> 34:56.560
Anything.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.663
You ask and it's yours.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.765
Yes...

35:01.767 --> 35:03.467
Anything.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.802
Because from now on,
you belong to me.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.171
You will do and say
as I command.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.806
You will be charged with...

35:09.808 --> 35:11.508
Well, whatever
I damn well please,

35:11.510 --> 35:14.578
Before I publicly take
everything you have.

35:14.580 --> 35:18.515
You're my puppet now.

35:18.517 --> 35:21.218
And should you outlive
your usefulness,

35:21.220 --> 35:23.153
I'll have you slaughtered
in the dead of night.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.828
Sleep well, narcisse.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.574
(catherine gasps)

35:49.580 --> 35:51.848
(moans softly)

36:04.795 --> 36:07.430
(breathing quickens)

36:09.367 --> 36:11.568
(gasps)

36:14.372 --> 36:15.872
Henry?

36:15.874 --> 36:18.508
You can't be real.

36:19.644 --> 36:21.578
Don't I feel real?

36:24.415 --> 36:26.316
(breathlessly): Stop.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.518
(moans)
stop.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.619
St-stop it.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.788
What is happening to me?

36:31.790 --> 36:32.889
Why are you here?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.691
The twins found me.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.494
You mustn't...

36:37.496 --> 36:41.398
Feel guilty about claude.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.633
You did right by us.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.236
No, but...

36:50.341 --> 36:52.375
Doesn't this feel
right, too?

36:52.377 --> 36:54.878
Uh-huh.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.880
The fun we'll have,
catherine.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.748
(moans)

36:58.750 --> 37:00.517
(moans)

37:00.519 --> 37:02.686
Say it, say it,

37:02.688 --> 37:06.289
Say that you want me back.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.558
Catherine, please,

37:08.560 --> 37:10.994
I need you to say it.

37:12.730 --> 37:18.368
I want you back.

37:25.309 --> 37:28.612
(liquid pouring)

37:30.615 --> 37:31.581
Antoine.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.484
Little brother.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.386
I, um,
I let myself in.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.021
You don't mind, do you?

37:38.023 --> 37:40.924
Did you have anything to do
with the attack on the castle?

37:40.926 --> 37:42.692
Oh, come on, louis,
you know me.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.494
If I had set that in motion,
it would have been a success.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.930
It was the work of fanatics.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.699
All passion, no organization.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.269
Then why are you here?

37:52.271 --> 37:53.970
As the king of navarre,

37:53.972 --> 37:56.906
I suppose you could call it
work-related.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.542
Your reports have
grown briefer

37:59.544 --> 38:01.478
And fewer.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.013
Why is that?

38:04.548 --> 38:05.882
You were supposed
to befriend francis,

38:05.884 --> 38:07.350
Find out what kind
of king he is,

38:07.352 --> 38:08.752
Where he's vulnerable,

38:08.754 --> 38:10.720
But as I hear it,
you've grown closer

38:10.722 --> 38:12.455
To the queen instead.

38:12.457 --> 38:16.960
I'm... I'm told she's
a... A great beauty.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.362
Have you fallen for her?

38:19.364 --> 38:20.897
No.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.532
Of course not.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.869
Good.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.806
If the time should come when
you need to choose between

38:29.808 --> 38:33.943
Your new friends,
and your family...

38:33.945 --> 38:37.447
Well, your choice will be clear.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.018
(owl hooting)

38:42.020 --> 38:44.454
Queen mary.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.022
We found this
in the royal chambers

38:46.024 --> 38:47.590
As we were clearing out
your things.

38:47.592 --> 38:48.825
It must have slid
under the carpet

38:48.827 --> 38:49.959
When it was delivered.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.335
Conde:
<i>Mary,</i>

38:58.337 --> 38:59.836
<i>When you read this,</i>
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

38:59.838 --> 39:01.838
<i>I'm sorry</i>
<i>I didn't say good-bye,</i>

39:01.840 --> 39:03.940
But seeing you again would have
<i>weakened my resolve.</i>

39:03.942 --> 39:06.710
I know I agreed to marry claude
<i>on behalf of France</i>

39:06.712 --> 39:09.012
<i>But I've realized I can't.</i>

39:09.014 --> 39:11.514
<i>My heart lies with another.</i>

39:11.516 --> 39:13.416
<i>I've fallen in love</i>
<i>with a queen.</i>
