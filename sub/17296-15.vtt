Ice cream.

00:30.813 --> 00:34.251
Oh, why must we eat
this vanilla bean slurry?

00:34.295 --> 00:37.689
It's so cold and gross.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.691
Well, if you don't finish
your ice cream

00:39.735 --> 00:43.173
then there will be
no vegetables for any of you.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.175
What? No vegetables?

00:45.219 --> 00:47.525
You cannot do that!

00:47.569 --> 00:50.876
Vegetables are only for people
who eat their ice cream.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.749
Oh, do I have to eat the cherry?

00:53.792 --> 00:56.447
Yes, and the whipped cream,
and the chocolate syrup,

00:56.491 --> 00:59.363
and the nuts too, young lady.
Every last bit.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.238
Ugh!

01:10.940 --> 01:12.724
I see what you're doing.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.074
Pushing that ice cream around
so it looks like you ate some.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.988
- It's not gonna work.
- No fair.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.991
I don't want any more dessert.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.298
I want vegetables right now!

01:21.342 --> 01:24.562
No vegetables until your bowls
are empty. Simple as that.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.607
Fine.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.483
- Ugh!
- Ugh.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.137
Ugh!

01:34.181 --> 01:36.139
Okay, let's see those bowls.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.401
Very good.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.142

01:57.465 --> 02:00.120
And those sweet,
sweet potatoes. Mmm.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.774
I do love me some
good vegetables.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.125
Titans, it's time for bed.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.258
Bed time's not
for an hour, dude.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.477
Have you all forgotten?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.174
Tonight is daylight saving time.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.046
Who is the dastardly villain

02:14.090 --> 02:16.962
from whom daylight
must save the time?

02:17.006 --> 02:18.877
No, Star.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.836
Daylight saving time is the
completely pointless practice

02:20.879 --> 02:22.794
of adjusting our clocks
one hour forward

02:22.838 --> 02:24.448
during the summer months

02:24.492 --> 02:26.276
so that the sun stays up
an hour longer in the evening.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.365
Then in the fall, we set
our clocks back an hour.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.150
Hence the terms "spring forward"

02:30.193 --> 02:31.499
and "fall back."

02:31.542 --> 02:34.458
Oh, man, one less hour
to sleep tonight?

02:34.502 --> 02:37.331
Daylight savings time
is the worst.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.810
It's actually
"daylight saving time."

02:38.854 --> 02:39.985
That's what I said.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.161
No, you said,
"Daylight savings time."

02:41.204 --> 02:42.205
It's "daylight saving time."

02:42.249 --> 02:43.467
I don't hear the difference.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.903
Listen closely.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.209
Daylight saving time.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.516
Exactly as friend
Cyborg said it.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.692
No, daylight saving time.
Saving!

02:50.735 --> 02:53.085
Yeah, daylight savings time.
That's what I said.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.696
We just keep saying
the same thing.

02:54.739 --> 02:58.743
No! You are saying "savings"!
It's not "savings"!

02:58.787 --> 03:01.355
It's singular! Saving!

03:01.398 --> 03:03.705
A daylight saving time!

03:03.748 --> 03:07.361
Oh, you means
dayslights saving times.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.102
My concern remains with the lost time

03:10.146 --> 03:12.322
that must be saved
by the daylights.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.671
It's not really lost.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.064
The clock just leaps forward

03:15.107 --> 03:16.848
between 2:00 a.m.
and 3:00 a.m.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.850
The hour must go
the somewhere, Robin.

03:18.894 --> 03:21.201
The hour doesn't go anywhere.
It's an hour.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.855
Yo, you know what?
I bet a farmer took it.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.118
Oh, yeah, farmers.

03:26.162 --> 03:29.034
Wasn't daylight savings time
their idea?

03:29.078 --> 03:30.688
That's a common misconception.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.213
Farmers have nothing to do
with daylight saving time.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.518
Oh, yeah, they do.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.259
Those dirty farmers.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.087
You know what?
They probablys
wanna steal our time

03:38.130 --> 03:39.610
and ruin our sleeps
because we eats up

03:39.654 --> 03:41.873
all the vegetables they grows
on their farms.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.440
Of course.

03:43.484 --> 03:46.226
That must be why the daylight
must save the time.

03:46.269 --> 03:49.141
Because of the farmers.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.231
Farmers are not ruining
our sleep schedules

03:51.274 --> 03:53.233
because we eat their vegetables!

03:53.276 --> 03:56.888
Friends, I have just realized.
It is the night time.

03:56.932 --> 04:00.240
And so it will be impossible
for daylight to save the time.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.547
She's right, there's no
daylight at night time.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.376
Guys, you're taking
the phrase too literally.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.074
If daylight is not here
to save the time,

04:09.118 --> 04:11.294
then I will take up the duty.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.730
We're with you, Star.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.993
Ain'ts no farmers
gonna get up in here.

04:21.957 --> 04:25.656
The time is about to spring the forward.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.270
What?

04:30.313 --> 04:32.576
It went from 1:59 to 3:00.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.274
I can't believe it!

04:34.317 --> 04:35.797
The clocked
skipped of the 2:00

04:35.840 --> 04:38.408
and went directly to the 3:00!

04:38.452 --> 04:39.757
I'm freaking out!

04:39.801 --> 04:41.803
It happened right
under our noses!

04:41.846 --> 04:43.674
Guys, most clocks adjust

04:43.718 --> 04:45.763
for daylight
saving time automatically.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.984
Oh, yeah, then how
do you explain this?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.594
What? A messy room?

04:50.638 --> 04:51.943
This place is always a mess.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.771
I thoughts you was
a detective, fool!

04:53.815 --> 04:55.164
This is a crime scene.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.127
Mmm-hmm.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.478
I thinks I sees
what's going on here.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.132
That dirty farmer came in here
through that ceiling vent.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.004
As a farmer is wont to do.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.136
And that's when he
grabbed my dude Two O'Clock.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.182
Just when he was
about to start his shift.

05:13.225 --> 05:16.185
And it looks like
Two O'Clock put up a fight.

05:16.228 --> 05:19.449
But the farmer
overpowered the Two O'Clock

05:19.493 --> 05:22.365
with his pitching fork
and took him away.

05:22.409 --> 05:27.196
Or, the clock moved
forward automatically.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.546
Since daylight is not here
to save the time,

05:29.590 --> 05:31.331
the burden is upon us.

05:31.374 --> 05:34.029
You can't save something
that doesn't physically exist!

05:34.072 --> 05:36.727
Those farmers about
to buy the farm, yo!

05:36.771 --> 05:38.860
Let us save the Two O'Clock.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.821
This is where
we will find the lost hour.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.389
Please don't harass
some poor farmer.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.566
Ohs, we's about to harass!
What's the plan, mama?

05:49.610 --> 05:52.352
Based on my knowledge
or the agrarian life styles

05:52.395 --> 05:55.050
the farmer is no doubt
holding the Two O'Clock

05:55.093 --> 05:57.531
in the field of the corns.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.838
We should really be in bed,
not on some wild goose chase.

06:00.882 --> 06:03.493
If you wanna chase
that gooses, they over there.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.191
We's chasing time.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.368
The one other thing.

06:08.411 --> 06:11.371
This farmer has the dog.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.851
And Bingo is his name-o.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.375
B-I-N-G-O?

06:15.418 --> 06:16.854
B-I-N-G-O.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.595
B-I-N-G-O.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.119
And Bingo is his name-o.

06:21.163 --> 06:25.254
We have the one chance
to save the Two O'Clock.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.790
This is ridiculous.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.748
And hour is not
a physical object.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.576
What would it even look like?

07:26.620 --> 07:27.925
It looks like Two O'Clock, you little goof.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.797
2:00 doesn't
look like anything.

07:30.493 --> 07:31.799
There he is!

07:34.976 --> 07:37.761
Oh. I've been wrong
this whole time.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.763
I can't believe
I trusted farmers!

07:39.807 --> 07:41.417
Happens to the best of us.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.508
Who...
What are you doing here?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.815
Savings the time, friend.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.513
Now let's get you back
to where you belong.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.950
Just one little ear of corns
for the roads.

07:52.994 --> 07:53.995
No!

08:04.396 --> 08:08.139
Well, well.
Rats in the field, eh?

08:08.183 --> 08:11.491
So, you are the farmer?

08:11.534 --> 08:14.624
That's right.
Old MacDonald's my name.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.147
E-I-E-I-O.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.976
We farmers created
daylight saving time

08:19.020 --> 08:20.630
to ruin everyone's sleep.

08:20.674 --> 08:24.504
An act of revenge
for eating all our vegetables.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.244
We grow these crops.

08:26.288 --> 08:29.813
Takes months, you know.
And then people just eat them.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.643
It's deplorable.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.733
We are putting an end
to this cycle of hours lost.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.170
The here and the now!

08:41.433 --> 08:43.697
You think you can defeat me?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.047
I'm Old MacDonald, you fool.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.658
And on this farm,
I have an army.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.792
E-I-E-I-O!

08:55.883 --> 08:57.711
With an oink, oink here.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.582
And a moo, moo there.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.192
Here a cluck.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.542
There a cluck.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.370
Everywhere a cluck, cluck.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.372
Let's show these here intruders

09:07.416 --> 09:09.374
how we gets down on the farm!

09:09.418 --> 09:10.506
Get them!

09:34.922 --> 09:36.924
It is the over!

09:36.967 --> 09:38.926
Give us the hour back!

09:42.451 --> 09:43.583
What's he doing?

09:48.022 --> 09:49.589
He's calling his dog.

09:52.374 --> 09:56.421
And Bingo was his name-o!

10:03.951 --> 10:05.735
Nice try, city slickers.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.259
But this hour is mine.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.913
Finish them, Bingo!

10:13.177 --> 10:15.092
I was the fool to think
we could take the job

10:15.136 --> 10:18.618
of the daylight
and save the time.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.755
No!

10:25.799 --> 10:27.757
My old enemy!

10:27.801 --> 10:30.281
Oh, my gosh, it's happening.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.328
Daylight saving time!

10:37.985 --> 10:41.118
What a wonderful conclusion.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.859
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you guys.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.470
I mean, the whole thing
sounded so... So stupid.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.298
But I guess at this point,
I should know

10:47.342 --> 10:48.691
that the dumber
something sounds,

10:48.735 --> 10:49.953
the more real it is.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.607
Bingo.
