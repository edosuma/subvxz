00:53.800 --> 00:55.767
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FUNNY
A WEEK AGO,

00:55.800 --> 00:56.867
BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.100

01:13.833 --> 01:16.167
NO, YOU NEED

02:16.167 --> 02:17.667
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS PLACE,

02:19.800 --> 02:22.067

02:22.067 --> 02:24.233
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY HAD TO
SELL THE OLD PLACE.

02:24.267 --> 02:25.400
JUST 'CAUSE
OF THE WIRE ?

02:25.433 --> 02:26.400
THAT WIRE
WAS MAKING ME CRAZY.

02:26.433 --> 02:27.800
THAT'S NOT
A REASON TO MOVE.

02:27.833 --> 02:30.433
THAT IS A REASON TO MOVE,
WHEN YOU CAN'T GET RID OF IT.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.967
OH, THERE'S

02:39.533 --> 02:40.800
I LOVE THE HOTEL.

02:40.833 --> 02:43.233
I CANNOT LIVE THERE ANY LONGER,
IT'S NOT A HOUSE.

02:43.267 --> 02:46.367

YOU'RE KIDDING,
REALLY ?

04:50.567 --> 04:51.767

04:53.333 --> 04:54.367
A TREMENDOUS ACTOR.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
UNBELIEVABLE.

04:55.433 --> 04:56.833
HOW'S HE DOING ?

04:56.867 --> 04:59.100
HONESTLY, HE'S KIND OF
STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.533
IS THAT RIGHT ?

05:00.567 --> 05:02.667
EVERYBODY WANTS
GEORGE COSTANZA.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.533
YOU KNOW WHAT,
HE'S NOTHING LIKE GEORGE.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.333
HE'S NOTHING AT ALL
LIKE GEORGE.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.467
HE'S THE ANTITHESIS,
'CAUSE JASON IS BRILLIANT,

05:09.500 --> 05:14.100
AND GEORGE IS AN IDIOT,
JUST AN IMBECILE AND, YOU KNOW.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.767
IT'S JUST TOUGH TO
BRANCH OUT WITH THAT.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.267
THE RANGE OF CHARACTERS
THIS GUY CAN DO.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.533
YOU THINK
HE'S AN IDIOT, HUH ?

05:20.567 --> 05:22.167
IT'S THE CLASSIC
BARNACLE.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.767
BUT, YOU KNOW,
EVERY SITCOM NEEDS THAT.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.867
WHAT HAVE YOU

05:26.067 --> 05:27.700
YEAH, I BET.

05:27.733 --> 05:29.500
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS ?
GOT ANYTHING COMING
DOWN THE PIKE ?

05:29.533 --> 05:32.533
I'VE GOT IDEAS, BUT I CHOOSE
NOT TO CARRY THEM OUT.

05:32.567 --> 05:34.600
I SAY WE TEAM UP

YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING,
LET'S TAKE A MEETING.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.133
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.900
LET'S SIT DOWN
AND JUST KICK AROUND,

05:44.933 --> 05:46.267
KICK AROUND

05:46.300 --> 05:47.567
( Cheryl )
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.067

05:52.733 --> 05:53.733
REALLY ?

05:53.767 --> 05:55.200
IT'S NOT
FOR SALE.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.667
THAT'S CASHMERE ?

05:56.700 --> 05:58.667
100%.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.333
IT'S NICE, YEAH.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.533
ALRIGHT,
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED.

06:21.567 --> 06:22.567
AND THE MASTER
BEDROOM ?

06:22.600 --> 06:23.767
I LOVE
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.433
I LOVE THE DOWNSTAIRS,
I LOVE THE FIREPLACE.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.200
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,

06:27.233 --> 06:30.800
DID YOU NOTICE THAT WHEN
I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SWEATER

06:30.833 --> 06:32.833
HE SAID IT WAS
100% CASHMERE ?

06:32.867 --> 06:35.767
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
SWEATER'S 100% CASHMERE.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.100
IT'S, LIKE, MAYBE 35, 40,
50 AT THE MOST,

06:39.133 --> 06:40.233
BUT 100 ?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.467
THAT CAN'T BE--

06:41.500 --> 06:43.367
SOONER THE BETTER,
I'M READY TO--

06:43.400 --> 06:45.967
WAIT A SECOND, I MEAN,
DO YOU TRUST THIS GUY--

06:46.067 --> 06:48.100
'CAUSE THE GUY'S LYING
ABOUT A CASHMERE SWEATER.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.400
YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT ?

06:49.433 --> 06:52.133
WE'RE NOT BUYING A SWEATER,
WE'RE BUYING A HOUSE.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.867
OKAY, LISTEN, WE HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH TO OFFER.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.433
ABSOLUTELY...

07:00.233 --> 07:02.800
WHAT KIND A PERSON LIES

07:02.833 --> 07:06.233

07:06.267 --> 07:08.667
YOU KNOW, UH,

07:08.700 --> 07:11.067
I DO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

07:11.100 --> 07:12.833
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I LOVE JASON.

07:12.867 --> 07:16.200
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK AND DO TV NOW.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.767
OH, COME ON,
TV's A GREAT MEDIUM.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.900
TOO MUCH WORK.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.200
TOO MUCH WORK ?
YOU HAVE TO WORK.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.200
IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS,
I CAN'T DO IT.

07:23.233 --> 07:25.800
NO, YOU NEED TO WORK,
YOU NEED TO WORK.

07:25.833 --> 07:28.867
I'M MARRIED,
THAT'S PLENTY OF WORK.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.767
OKAY, BUT YOU NEED
TO START WRITING.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.733
JUST, YOU KNOW, I THINK FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD, FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.

07:34.767 --> 07:35.867
WHY, I'M NOT INSANE.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.533
YOU THINK I'M INSANE ?

07:37.567 --> 07:40.067

07:58.400 --> 07:59.667
OH, GOOD.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DIDN'T EVEN
MENTION THAT TO ME.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.900
HEY, TOM.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.467

08:09.433 --> 08:11.667
TOM CLARK, LARRY DAVID,
LARRY DAVID, TOM CLARK.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.267
LARRY DAVID,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.567
TOM, SIT DOWN, MAN.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.300
TOM SOLD ME
MY TOYOTA SEQUOIA.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.300
OH, TOYOTA OF HOLLYWOOD ?

08:21.333 --> 08:22.900
TOYOTA OF HOLLYWOOD, YEAH.

08:22.933 --> 08:24.533
SO, YOU'RE A CAR,
YOU'RE A CAR DEALER ?

08:24.567 --> 08:25.667
DEALER, YEAH.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.700
BUT I LIKE
TO SELL, TOO.

08:26.733 --> 08:27.767
DO YOU ?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.200
SOMEBODY SPECIAL COMES IN,
A BIG WIG...

08:29.233 --> 08:30.300
HE'S A BIG WIG ?

08:30.333 --> 08:32.367
YEAH, HE MANAGES.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.167
THAT'S GOOD,
I'M MANAGED BY A BIG WIG.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.233
WHAT DO YOU DRIVE ?

08:35.267 --> 08:36.300
I DRIVE A PRIUS.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.667
YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH THE PRIUS, THOUGH.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.700
VERY HAPPY, AND THE PRIUS
IS EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH ME.

08:40.733 --> 08:42.733
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.933
HOW DOES SOMEBODY
BECOME A CAR SALESMAN ?

08:44.967 --> 08:47.200
DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

08:47.233 --> 08:49.367
IT WAS IN
MY BLOOD, YEAH.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.933
IT TAKES YEARS
TO BE A CAR SALESMAN.

08:51.967 --> 08:55.200
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS FELT
I COULD BE A GREAT SALESMAN.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.200
WELL, YOU GOTTA
HAVE THE GIFT.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.733
BELIEVE ME, I COULD TALK
ANYBODY INTO ANYTHING.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.067
EXCEPT WOMEN INTO SEX, THAT'S
THE ONLY THING I CAN'T DO.

09:02.067 --> 09:05.167
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I KNOW HOW TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE,
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.367
CAR SALESMEN
ARE NOT BULLSHIT.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.067
NO, OF COURSE,
THEY'RE NOT.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.067
WE'RE AN HONEST PACK,
BETWEEN OURSELVES ESPECIALLY.

09:11.067 --> 09:13.700
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I LIKE TO MAKE MONEY.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.833
BUT I LOVE TO SELL CARS,
I REALLY DO.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.767
IF I WANTED TO DO THAT
FOR ONE DAY...

09:17.800 --> 09:18.800
SELL CARS.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.233
YEAH,
JUST FOR A DAY.

09:20.267 --> 09:21.800
HUH ?

09:21.833 --> 09:22.867
I DON'T THINK SO.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.267
I JUST WANT TO SEE
IF I COULD DO IT.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.067
'CAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT I'D BE GREAT AT IT.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.567
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT,
YOU'RE A WRITER.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.700
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

09:28.733 --> 09:30.100
( Jeff )
DO YOU KNOW
WHO HE IS ?

09:30.133 --> 09:32.233
THAT'S LARRY DAVID,
HE CREATED "SEINFELD".

09:32.267 --> 09:33.800
OH.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.333
OKAY ?

09:35.367 --> 09:37.167
FORGET THAT, I JUST WANT TO
TRY IT FOR A DAY.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.667
I THINK THAT
WOULD BE GREAT.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.267
COME IN AND
WORK FOR ME.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.567
MAYBE I'LL DO IT
FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.700
WHAT'RE YOU DOING ?!

09:43.733 --> 09:45.933
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

09:45.967 --> 09:47.667
WAIT A SECOND,
WHAT DO YOU CARE ?

09:47.700 --> 09:48.800
WHAT DO I CARE ?!

09:48.833 --> 09:50.233
WHAT IF I'M GOOD AT IT ?

09:50.267 --> 09:51.467
WHAT IF YOU'RE
GOOD AT IT ?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.500
YEAH.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.700
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SELL A CAR THE FIRST DAY.

09:54.733 --> 09:56.367
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
I GUARANTEE YOU

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
I WILL SELL MORE CARS THAN
ANYBODY IN YOUR SHOWROOM,

09:58.433 --> 09:59.500
GUARANTEE IT.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.033
YOU WON'T SELL A CAR
THE FIRST DAY.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.533
NOBODY DOES IT
THE FIRST DAY.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.000
YOU'LL SEE,
OKAY, FINE.

10:04.033 --> 10:05.167
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.500
COME BY, GET SOME BROCHURES,
YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

10:07.533 --> 10:09.600
I'LL GET THE BROCHURES,
I'LL STUDY UP

10:09.633 --> 10:11.633
AND I'LL LEARN EVERYTHING,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.467
I'LL HAVE IT DOWN
WHEN I GET THERE.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.200
UH, COME BY
ON MONDAY ?

10:15.233 --> 10:16.600
I REALLY
APPRECIATE THIS,

10:16.633 --> 10:18.067
BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE
A LITTLE FANTASY THAT I HAVE.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.267
THIS'LL BE GREAT,
MONDAY MORNING.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.333
YOU GOT IT.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.367
OKAY, GREAT.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.433
THANK YOU.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.500
I'M PRETTY EXCITED.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.400
OH, MY GOSH,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

10:32.433 --> 10:35.133
NO, NO, THAT IS
NO PROBLEM.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.233
OH, LARRY JUST WALKED IN,
CAN'T WAIT TO TELL HIM.

10:37.267 --> 10:38.267
OKAY, BYE.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.867
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.000
WE CAN MOVE INTO
THE HOUSE ON MONDAY.

10:42.033 --> 10:43.000
REALLY ?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.133
YEAH, IT'S ALL DONE.

10:44.167 --> 10:46.133
SO FAST ?

10:46.167 --> 10:48.433
YEAH, IT WAS A CASH DEAL,
THERE WAS NO ESCROW.

10:48.467 --> 10:50.300
THEY'VE ALREADY
MOVED THEIR STUFF OUT,
WE'RE READY.

10:50.333 --> 10:54.567
OH, SO, MAKE SURE THAT
YOU ARE CLEAR ON MONDAY,

10:54.600 --> 10:57.400
WHICH I'M SURE IS NOT GOING TO
BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

10:57.433 --> 11:00.067
I ACTUALLY CAN'T
DO IT ON MONDAY.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.300
WHY ?

11:01.333 --> 11:02.933
I GOT A JOB.

11:02.967 --> 11:04.767
YOU DID ?!

11:04.800 --> 11:07.100
OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
DID YOU CALL JASON ?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.867
I'M SELLING CARS.

11:12.567 --> 11:14.067
WHAT ?

11:14.067 --> 11:19.167
I WAS HAVING LUNCH TODAY
WITH A GUY WHO OWNS
A TOYOTA SHOWROOM.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.500
HE SOLD JEFF
SOME CARS AND, UH...

11:21.533 --> 11:24.300
SO, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
BE A CAR SALESMAN ?

11:24.333 --> 11:28.067
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
HE SAID I COULD TRY IT.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.300
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU ?!

11:29.333 --> 11:30.333
WHY ?
WHAT ?!

11:30.367 --> 11:31.767
YOU'VE COMMITTED
TO THIS ?

11:31.800 --> 11:35.067
IT'S ONLY FOR, LIKE,
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.500
OR HOWEVER LONG
I WANT TO DO IT, YOU KNOW.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.067
I JUST WANT TO GET IT
OUT OF MY SYSTEM--

11:39.067 --> 11:40.333
WELL, YOU CAN'T
DO IT ON MONDAY.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.533
WELL, I HAVE TO
DO IT ON MONDAY.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.067
I HAVE TO SHOW UP
FOR MY FIRST DAY AT WORK.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.967
WHAT, AM I SUPPOSED TO
CALL IN SICK ?

11:46.067 --> 11:47.967
THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY.

11:49.133 --> 11:53.200
PRIUS, HUH ?
THAT'S OURS, THAT'S EASY.

11:53.233 --> 11:54.933
UH, CAN I HELP YOU ?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.567
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.200
UH, EXCUSE ME, SIR,

11:59.233 --> 12:01.500
PERHAPS THE LAND CRUISER
WOULD INTEREST YOU.

12:01.533 --> 12:04.633
AND WE HAVE, UH,
COROLLA, CANOLA,

12:04.667 --> 12:07.967
AND, UH, RAVE,
IS IT RAV ?

12:08.067 --> 12:09.633
THIS IS SO STUPID.

12:09.667 --> 12:10.767
WHY IS IT STUPID ?

12:10.800 --> 12:11.867
IT'S INSANE.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.600
SOME PEOPLE,
THEY RUN IN MARATHONS,

12:13.633 --> 12:14.900
THEY WANT TO SEE
IF THEY CAN DO THAT.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.067
OTHER PEOPLE, WHAT, THEY SWIM
THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.500
ALL I WANT TO DO IS WORK IN
A SHOWROOM FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

12:19.533 --> 12:23.100
SO, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?
WHO'S MORE INSANE ?

12:23.133 --> 12:25.800
AND THEN ON MONDAY
WHEN I COME HOME FROM WORK,

12:25.833 --> 12:29.100
I'LL HELP WITH THE PICTURES
OR WHATEVER YOU NEED ME

12:29.133 --> 12:31.267
TO HELP AROUND
THE HOUSE WITH.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.567
I'LL HELP
WHEN I COME HOME.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.067
BUT I'LL BE A LITTLE
TIRED, TOO, PROBABLY.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.700
YEAH, HEY, ALAN,
GUESS WHAT.

12:44.733 --> 12:47.600
LARRY DAVID
JUST WALKED IN.

12:47.633 --> 12:48.933
WHO YOU TALKING TO ?

12:48.967 --> 12:49.967

12:50.067 --> 12:51.200

SAY HELLO FOR ME.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.933
OKAY, YOU TAKE CARE,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

12:54.967 --> 12:57.300
HEY, MAN,
HOW YA DOING ?

12:57.333 --> 12:59.800
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.200
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
SAY HELLO ?

13:01.233 --> 13:03.933
THERE WASN'T
AN OPENING.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.933
BOY, YOU LOOK, GREAT.

13:05.967 --> 13:07.233
OH, WELL, YEAH.

13:07.267 --> 13:08.567
COME SIT DOWN,
COME SIT DOWN.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.367
YOU WANT, UH, WATER
OR A COFFEE OR... ?

13:10.400 --> 13:11.800
UH, NAW, I'M GOOD.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.900
OKAY.

13:13.933 --> 13:16.200
SO, SO, SO, L.D.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.267
YEAH ?

13:17.300 --> 13:18.600
WHAT IT BE ?

13:18.633 --> 13:21.667
I LIKE HOW OUR REPRESENTATIVES
GOT US TOGETHER HERE.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.233
RIGHT, SCHNEIDER, YEAH.

13:23.267 --> 13:24.700
THEY SET US UP.

13:24.733 --> 13:26.300
DID HE TELL YOU THAT I WAS
BUYING HIS HOUSE ?

13:26.333 --> 13:28.067
YEAH, WOW.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.100
SO, THIS IS GOOD,
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING ?

13:30.133 --> 13:31.700
THINGS ARE, YOU KNOW,
THINGS ARE GOOD.

13:31.733 --> 13:34.833
I DON'T KNOW, I'VE GOT
THIS SET UP AND, UH,

13:34.867 --> 13:37.400
DID SOME DIRECTING AND
TRYING TO PRODUCE SOME STUFF.

13:37.433 --> 13:43.233
YOU KNOW, THE ACTING THING IS,
FRANKLY COMING A LITTLE HARD.

13:43.267 --> 13:45.567
I'D LOVE TO GO BACK TO TV,
THAT SEEMS GOOD.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.600
BUT I CAN'T SHAKE
THIS GEORGE THING.

13:47.633 --> 13:50.967
THEY ALL SEE ME
AS GEORGE.

13:51.067 --> 13:54.567
THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO GEORGE.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.267
I TELL THIS
TO PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.767
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
A GREAT ACTOR THIS GUY IS.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.733
HE IS NOTHING
LIKE THAT CHARACTER.

14:00.767 --> 14:02.167
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.967
I KNOW, AND, YOU KNOW,
I GO IN AND I TALK TO THEM

14:05.067 --> 14:06.867
AND WE, YOU KNOW, I TRY TO
PRESENT DIFFERENTLY.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.733
BUT THEY, UH,
THEY SEE THE IDIOT,

14:09.767 --> 14:13.567
THEY SEE THE SCHMUCK,
SO, I DON'T KNOW.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.200
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN SCHMUCK,
I DON'T GET THAT.

14:15.233 --> 14:16.267
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SCHMUCK ?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.067
THE YUTZ, THE IDIOT,
THE, YOU KNOW.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.200
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW.

14:20.233 --> 14:21.967
NO, FRANKLY
I DON'T KNOW.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.400
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAN SAY
HE'S A SCHMUCK AND A YUTZ
AND AN IDIOT.

14:24.433 --> 14:26.633
I DON'T SEE HIM THAT WAY AT ALL,
I JUST SEE HIM AS FUNNY.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.500
I MEAN, OF COURSE,
IT WAS FUNNY.

14:28.533 --> 14:33.300
BUT HE WAS THE FALL GUY,
THE JACKASS ROLE.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.467
THIS IS THE GUY
THAT NEVER GOT THE GIRL

14:36.500 --> 14:38.600
AND HE FINALLY GETS THE GIRL
AND HE KILLS HER

14:38.633 --> 14:40.533
WITH THE ENVELOPE, AND, UH,
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS.

14:40.567 --> 14:43.533
THAT'S FUNNY, THAT'S NOT
SCHMUCKY, THAT'S FUNNY.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.567
WHAT IS MORE
JERKY OR PUTZY

14:45.600 --> 14:47.267
THAN GOING
TO A GIRL'S HOUSE

14:47.300 --> 14:49.900
AND STEALING A TAPE OUT OF
HER ANSWERING MACHINE ?

14:49.933 --> 14:51.200
I WENT TO A GIRL'S HOUSE

14:51.233 --> 14:52.900
AND TOOK A TAPE OUT OF
AN ANSWERING MACHINE.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.733
LARRY, HE'S EATING ECLAIRS
OUT OF A GARBAGE CAN ?!

14:55.767 --> 14:57.767
YEAH, SO WHAT, I ATE AN ECLAIR
OUT OF A GARBAGE CAN !

14:57.800 --> 15:00.200
AND, MASTURBATION CONTESTS,
FOUR PEOPLE AGREEING--

15:00.233 --> 15:01.467
I WAS IN A CONTEST

15:01.500 --> 15:03.333
AND YOU KNOW I WAS IN THAT
MASTURBATION CONTEST !

15:03.367 --> 15:07.267
SO, I'M A SCHMUCK FOR BEING
IN A MASTURBATION CONTEST ?

15:07.300 --> 15:10.400
IT'S NOT AN INCREDIBLY
NOBLE EXPERIMENT, WAS IT ?

15:10.433 --> 15:12.467
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT YOU
HATE THE CHARACTER SO MUCH.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.467
I DON'T HATE THE CHARACTER,
I'M A LITTLE TIRED OF IT.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.567
I MEAN, I'M AN ACTOR.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.900
I HAVE A RANGE OF CHARACTERS
THAT I CAN PLAY.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.767
WHY AM I RELEGATED
TO THIS ?!

15:22.567 --> 15:25.633
EVERYWHERE I GO ON THE STREET,
"HEY, COSTANZA",

15:25.667 --> 15:28.900
"HEY, JACKASS."

15:28.933 --> 15:32.167
I JUST HAD THIS,
I JUST HAD THIS IDEA.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.567
I DON'T KNOW, I'LL THROW IT
OUT AT YOU, OKAY ?

15:36.600 --> 15:39.967
FOR A SERIES,
AN IDEA FOR A SERIES, OKAY ?

15:40.067 --> 15:45.633
YOU PLAYED A CHARACTER BASED ON
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH NOW.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.700
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU PLAY AN ACTOR

15:47.733 --> 15:52.300
AND THE ACTOR IS HAVING
A TOUGH TIME GETTING WORK

15:52.333 --> 15:54.567
BECAUSE HE WAS ON THIS
MEGA-HIT SERIES,

15:54.600 --> 15:56.267
LIKE A "SEINFELD"
KIND OF SERIES,

15:56.300 --> 16:00.200
AND NOW THIS ACTOR, AFTER
THE SERIES GOES OFF THE AIR,

16:00.233 --> 16:02.233
HE CAN'T
GET WORK ANYMORE

16:02.267 --> 16:05.400
BECAUSE HE'S SO IDENTIFIED
WITH THIS CHARACTER

16:05.433 --> 16:07.233
THAT THEY WON'T LET HIM
DO ANYTHING ELSE.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.900
AND HE BECOMES EMBITTERED AND
GROWS TO HATE THE CHARACTER.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.333
THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.067
THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.967

16:31.533 --> 16:34.667
I'M KIND OF,

17:08.167 --> 17:09.200
OKAY.

17:09.233 --> 17:10.233

17:10.267 --> 17:11.400
GOOD LUCK.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.900
ANYTHING ELSE

17:16.933 --> 17:20.200

17:20.233 --> 17:22.067

OKAY.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.167
JUST, UM, HAVE FUN.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
ALRIGHT,
THANK YOU.

17:25.233 --> 17:26.567
THE CARS

17:26.600 --> 17:29.067
I'LL SEE YOU AT LUNCH.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.967
HI, I'M LARRY.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.067
HI, LARRY,
ARCHIE.

17:41.067 --> 17:43.700
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
MY WIFE'S NAME IS VERONICA.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.867
SO, THIS IS THE, UH, CAMRY
I HEARD ABOUT, HUH ?

17:45.900 --> 17:47.700
THIS IS THE BIG BOY,
THE TOP OF THE LINE.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.133
THIS IS AS GOOD
AS IT GETS.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.433
YOU KNOW, YOU HEAR
LEXUS, LEXUS, LEXUS.

17:52.467 --> 17:55.333
WE DON'T HEAR CAMRY, CAMRY,
BUT THAT'S WHAT
YOU SHOULD BE HEARING.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.233
WELL, TELL ME,
WHAT'S IN THE ENGINE HERE ?

17:57.267 --> 17:58.467
WHAT'S IN IT ?

17:58.500 --> 18:03.133
BIG STUFF, BIG CHARGING,
CRAZY PISTONS, NUTTY PISTONS.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.167
IS IT TWIN CAM ?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.233
YEAH, TWIN CAM.

18:05.267 --> 18:06.467
WHAT OTHER COLORS--

18:06.500 --> 18:08.967
THIS IS A FUCKIN'
WORK OF ART.

18:09.067 --> 18:10.067
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

18:10.067 --> 18:11.100
SHIRLEY.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.267
SHIRLEY,
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S NAME.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.933
UH, TILT WHEEL STEERING,
WHICH I REALLY LIKE.

18:15.967 --> 18:17.533
DOES THIS CAR HAVE THAT ?
IS IT STANDARD ?

18:17.567 --> 18:20.400
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
THE NEED TO TILT IN THIS CAR.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.133
I'VE NEVER HAD
A TILTING NEED.

18:22.167 --> 18:26.167
MY WIFE CALLS IT PEPPY,
"ARE WE TAKING PEPPY ?"

18:26.200 --> 18:27.767
'CAUSE WE HAVE TWO CARS,
SHE SAYS, "LET'S TAKE PEPPY".

18:27.800 --> 18:29.500
WHAT KIND OF GAS MILEAGE
AM I GOING TO GET ?

18:29.533 --> 18:30.533
52.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.533
52 IN THE CITY.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.233
DEPENDING ON THE CITY,
OF COURSE.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.767
DULUTH IS A CITY,
IT'S CONSIDERED A CITY,

18:35.800 --> 18:39.867
BUT IT'S NOT AS BIG AS
BROOKLYN OR WHATEVER.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.167
OKAY.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.367
THAT'S MY
BROTHER'S NAME.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.567
OH, REALLY ?

18:43.600 --> 18:44.633
YEAH.

18:44.667 --> 18:45.867
WHAT'S THE WHEEL BASE ?

18:45.900 --> 18:49.367
MY WIFE IS CONCERNED
ABOUT A CAR BEING SOLID.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.300
IT'S A THICK BASE,
IT'S A THICK WHEEL BASE.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.467
I HEARD THAT THESE,
UH, SUVs,

18:56.500 --> 18:59.167
THAT THEY, SOMETIMES
THEY ROLL OVER RATHER EASILY.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.467
ROLL OVER,
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

19:00.500 --> 19:02.467
LOOK AT THIS THING,
LOOK AT THIS.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.733
( alarm going off )

19:05.833 --> 19:07.067
DANA.

19:07.067 --> 19:09.533
DANA, THAT'S MY MIDDLE NAME,
LARRY DANA DAVID.

19:09.567 --> 19:11.933
UH, I NOTICE
THIS IS A GT,

19:11.967 --> 19:15.833
AND THE BROCHURE SAYS
THERE'S A MODEL CALLED THE GTS.

19:15.867 --> 19:19.067
NOW, WHAT, WHAT IS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THE GT AND THE GTS ?

19:19.100 --> 19:22.933
THE GTS IS
"GUARANTEED TREMENDOUS SAFETY".

19:22.967 --> 19:27.900
SO, WITHOUT THE "S", IT'S JUST
"GUARANTEED TREMENDOUS".

19:29.833 --> 19:31.433
HOW YOU DOING ?

19:31.467 --> 19:32.667
HI, CAN I
HELP YOU FOLKS ?

19:32.700 --> 19:33.733
APHEON.

19:33.767 --> 19:34.767
APHEON.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.900
THAT'S MY
STEP-BROTHER'S NAME, APHEON.

19:36.933 --> 19:38.867
( P.A. announcement )

19:38.900 --> 19:41.300
THAT MIGHT BE FOR ME,
ONE SECOND.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.633
NO, OKAY.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.533
I WANT TO FIND OUT
MORE ABOUT THE CAR.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.800
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT THE FEATURES ARE
SO WE CAN NEGOTIATE--

19:46.833 --> 19:48.333
DON'T BE ACTING LIKE

19:48.367 --> 19:50.400
YOU GOING TO PUT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF STUFF BACK HERE.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.200
WHAT YOU NEED
A BIG CAR FOR ?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.967
I DON'T NEED TO TALK MYSELF,
I LIKE THIS CAR.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.633
OKAY, COULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR ONE SECOND ?

19:55.667 --> 19:57.900
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING OVER HERE ?

19:57.933 --> 19:59.600
YOU'RE FUCKING UP
MY SHIT, MAN.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.100
WHY YOU PUSHING SO HARD
TO GET THIS, UH--

20:01.133 --> 20:04.133
BECAUSE SHE LIKES THE CAR, SHE
WANTS TO BE HAPPY IN THE CAR.

20:04.167 --> 20:05.700
MAYBE SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO AFFORD THE CAR

20:05.733 --> 20:07.000
IF SHE TAKES IT
OFF THE LOT.

20:07.033 --> 20:11.300
IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO COULD
HELP ME WITH THIS CAR ?

20:12.767 --> 20:16.033
LOOK, SIR, I'M SORRY,
THANK YOU.

20:16.067 --> 20:18.067
I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED
IN BUYING TODAY, OKAY ?

20:18.100 --> 20:20.567
WHAT ?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?
SHIRLEY ?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.433
EVER SEEN
THE "SEINFELD" SHOW ?

20:22.467 --> 20:23.567
YEAH.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.933
I'M THE CO-CREATOR
OF THE SHOW.

20:26.967 --> 20:30.467
NO, IT'S TRUE.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.467
PLEASE, BUY ONE,
PLEASE ?

20:33.500 --> 20:37.433
YOU'LL SELL A LOT OF THEM,
YOU'RE A GOOD SALESMAN.

20:54.267 --> 20:55.667
CHERYL ?

20:55.700 --> 20:57.567
HI !

20:57.600 --> 20:59.667
ISN'T THIS WEIRD,
COMING HOME TO YOUR NEW HOUSE ?

20:59.700 --> 21:02.267
YEAH, HI.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.933
OH, HEY, SO,
HOW DID IT GO TODAY ?

21:05.967 --> 21:07.333
PRETTY GOOD.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.333
REALLY ?

21:08.367 --> 21:09.600
YEAH.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.133
DID YOU SELL
A LOT OF CARS ?

21:11.167 --> 21:13.433
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
HOW THE BUSINESS WORKS.

21:13.467 --> 21:14.433
NO ?

21:14.467 --> 21:16.300
NO, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T JUST SELL THEM.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.700
PEOPLE, THEY THINK ABOUT IT
AND THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,

21:18.733 --> 21:21.433
YOU GET BACK IN TOUCH
WITH THEM AND...

21:21.467 --> 21:24.067
ARE YOU, UH,
OVER IT NOW ?

21:25.267 --> 21:27.333
YOU KNOW,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

21:27.367 --> 21:28.700
THE WHOLE
CAR SELLING THING.

21:28.733 --> 21:31.867
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT
JUST AFTER ONE DAY, YOU KNOW,

21:31.900 --> 21:33.667
I WANT TO DO IT RIGHT.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.933
I WANT TO SHOW THEM
I CAN DO IT.

21:35.967 --> 21:38.167
OKAY.

21:38.200 --> 21:43.067
BUT, I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.600
TELL ME, I HAVE BEEN
UNPACKING ALL DAY.

21:48.733 --> 21:50.833
HOUSE SEEMS DIFFERENT
THAN IT DID THE OTHER DAY.

21:50.867 --> 21:53.567
YEAH, IT'S DEFINITELY
DIFFERENT.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.433
IT FEELS STRANGE,
THAT'S ALL.

21:56.467 --> 21:59.100
MAYBE AFTER WE, UH,
HANG EVERYTHING UP

21:59.133 --> 22:01.700
AND FINISH UNPACKING.

22:01.733 --> 22:03.800
MAYBE,
I DON'T KNOW.

22:16.433 --> 22:18.067
( strange noise )

22:19.767 --> 22:22.600
WHAT'S THAT NOISE ?

22:22.633 --> 22:25.533
DO YOU HEAR A NOISE ?

22:25.567 --> 22:27.300
YEAH.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.800
WHAT IS IT ?

22:30.833 --> 22:34.433
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A HOUSE SOUND OR SOMETHING.

22:34.467 --> 22:35.633
A HOUSE SOUND ?

22:35.667 --> 22:36.933
YEAH.

22:36.967 --> 22:38.433
WHAT'S A HOUSE SOUND ?

22:38.467 --> 22:40.500
YOU KNOW, NOISES
THAT A HOUSE MAKES ?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.367
HOUSES MAKE NOISES ?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.600
YEAH, PLUMBING OR JUST,
IT'S SETTLING.

22:45.633 --> 22:47.733
WHAT ?
SETTLING ?

22:53.067 --> 22:56.367
I CAN'T, I CAN'T
SLEEP WITH THAT.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.900
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT,
JUST IGNORE IT.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.567
OUR LAST HOUSE
DIDN'T MAKE ANY SOUNDS.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.200
YES, IT DID,
YOU'LL GET USED TO THIS.

23:04.233 --> 23:06.867
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.300
I'M GOING TO BE UP ALL NIGHT
WITH THIS THING.

23:08.333 --> 23:10.833
GOTTA BE FRESH
IN THE MORNING.

23:14.533 --> 23:16.567
TOLD YOU I DIDN'T
TRUST THAT SCHNEIDER.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.167
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT A HOUSE SOUND.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.867
( strange noise continues )

23:44.200 --> 23:46.333
AND IT'S LIKE, IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE DRIVING A BUS UP THERE.

23:46.367 --> 23:47.700
YEAH, LOOKING
OVER THE TRAFFIC.

23:47.733 --> 23:49.400
DIDN'T YOU USED TO
ENVY BUS DRIVERS ?

23:49.433 --> 23:50.533
OH, YEAH.

23:50.567 --> 23:52.867
WITH THE BIG ROUND
STEERING WHEEL LIKE THAT.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.800
MAKES YOU, GIVES YOU
A LITTLE EGO BOOST.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.133
OVERSEE THE TRAFFIC.

23:56.167 --> 23:57.400
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.267
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT VIEW.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.067
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I THINK I'M READY TO BUY.

24:01.067 --> 24:02.167
OH, NO KIDDING.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.233
YEAH.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.600
OH, GREAT.

24:04.633 --> 24:06.200
YOU GET THE WOOD GRAIN,
WE MIGHT DO THIS TODAY.

24:06.233 --> 24:08.200
WE COULD GET
SOME WOOD GRAIN.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.700
WHAT, WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT
GETTING WOOD GRAIN ?

24:09.733 --> 24:10.700
WOOD.

24:10.733 --> 24:12.833
WOOD GRAIN IS NOT GOING TO
STOP US FROM--

24:12.867 --> 24:15.300
THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO HEAR.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.967
THIS IS A JOKE,
RIGHT ?

24:17.067 --> 24:19.400
COULD YOU PLEASE
EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE ?

24:19.433 --> 24:20.933
I'M TALKING TO SOMEBODY.

24:20.967 --> 24:22.367
THIS IS
A PRACTICAL JOKE, RIGHT ?

24:22.400 --> 24:25.800
A PRACTICAL JOKE ?
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

24:25.833 --> 24:27.367
WOULD PLEASE EXCUSE US
FOR A SECOND ?

24:27.400 --> 24:28.533
I'M TALKING TO
SOMEBODY HERE.

24:28.567 --> 24:29.600
I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE.

24:29.633 --> 24:30.900

24:30.933 --> 24:33.100
EXCUSE ME,

24:37.767 --> 24:39.133
YOU'RE WITH A CUSTOMER,
YOU'RE SELLING CARS TO THIS--

24:39.167 --> 24:40.333
SIR, SIR !

24:40.367 --> 24:41.533

24:41.567 --> 24:42.867
FORGET HIM.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.733
YOU JUST COST ME
A CUSTOMER.

24:44.767 --> 24:46.833
YOU JUST COST ME
A CUSTOMER !

24:46.867 --> 24:48.433
YOU COST ME A CUSTOMER.

24:48.467 --> 24:49.767
I HAD HIM !

24:49.800 --> 24:51.067
HOW CAN YOU
HAVE A CUSTOMER ?

24:51.100 --> 24:53.267
I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE HIM
INTO THE MANAGER'S OFFICE.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.100
WHAT ARE YOU,
FUCKIN' WILLY LOMAN ?

24:55.133 --> 24:56.733

24:57.900 --> 24:59.300

25:00.867 --> 25:02.467
WHICH I SAY,

25:02.500 --> 25:04.200
BUT WHAT I'M REALLY FUCKIN'
DOWN HERE IS FOR,

25:04.233 --> 25:05.700
YOU TELL HIM
THAT I'M HIGH MAINTENANCE ?

25:05.733 --> 25:06.833
HE'S MY MANAGER NOW,

25:06.867 --> 25:08.700
WHAT IF HE GOES TO A STUDIO,
TO THE PALM OR SPAGO

25:08.733 --> 25:11.500
AND TELLS STUDIO PEOPLE,
LIKE, "I LOVE RICHARD
BUT HE'S HIGH MAINTENANCE" ?

25:11.533 --> 25:13.167
AND WHAT IF HE DOES ?

25:13.200 --> 25:15.067
I SPENT, LIKE, SEVEN YEARS
GETTING MY LIFE TOGETHER

25:15.067 --> 25:16.700
AND NOW ALL OF SUDDEN THEY
CAN THINK I'M LIKE A FUCKIN',

25:16.733 --> 25:18.933

25:18.967 --> 25:21.967
OH, NO, YOU WON'T GET THE REMAKE
"FROM HERE TO ETERNITY".

25:22.067 --> 25:23.233
PEOPLE, I THOUGHT
I HAD DARK SECRETS ?

25:23.267 --> 25:24.400
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS ALL ABOUT ?

25:24.433 --> 25:25.633
IT'S NOT A DARK SECRET.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.867
LARRY DAVID SELLING CARS
IS NOT A DARK SECRET ?

25:27.900 --> 25:29.400
IS THAT
A CASHMERE SWEATER ?

25:29.433 --> 25:30.967
THIS GUY HAD
THE SAME ONE.

25:31.067 --> 25:32.533
OF COURSE
IT'S A CASHMERE SWEATER.

25:32.567 --> 25:34.767
IS THAT 100% CASHMERE ?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.067
WHAT ARE YOU

25:36.100 --> 25:37.300
IS THAT 100% CASHMERE ?

25:37.333 --> 25:38.600
WHAT, YOU DON'T

25:38.633 --> 25:40.233
WOULD YOU MIND

25:40.267 --> 25:41.933
I JUST WANT TO--

25:41.967 --> 25:43.067

25:44.100 --> 25:45.867
I DON'T LIKE
PEOPLE TOUCHING ME.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.933
I WON'T TOUCH YOU,
I'LL JUST TAKE--

25:47.967 --> 25:49.867

26:11.133 --> 26:12.167

26:12.200 --> 26:13.733

26:13.767 --> 26:15.733
I LOCKED HIM UP AND I WISH
YOU COULD HAVE HEARD IT.

26:15.767 --> 26:16.833

26:16.867 --> 26:18.467

26:25.067 --> 26:26.700

26:43.700 --> 26:45.767
UH, YEAH, I'VE CHECKED
ALL OVER THE HOUSE

26:45.800 --> 26:49.367
AND I CAN'T FIND THE HOUSE SOUND
THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.633
TELL HIM WHAT IT
SOUNDS LIKE AGAIN, LARRY.

26:53.667 --> 26:57.500
IT'S LIKE
A CAMERA WHIRRING.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.533
YOU SURE IT'S NOT
THE OCEAN ?

26:59.567 --> 27:01.633
IT'S NOT THE OCEAN,
I KNOW THE OCEAN.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.933
UM, SORRY, I JUST
HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING.

27:04.967 --> 27:07.767
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU DON'T
REALLY HEAR IT VERY WELL
UNTIL AFTER 10:00 AT NIGHT.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.967
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE'RE IN BED,
THAT'S WHEN I HEAR IT.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.067
I DON'T HEAR IT
DURING THE DAY.

27:11.067 --> 27:13.467
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN
COME BACK TONIGHT ?

27:13.500 --> 27:14.967
WAIT, UH, WHAT ?

27:15.067 --> 27:17.733

GREAT.

27:20.433 --> 27:22.167
YEAH, IF IT'S TROUBLE.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.533
IT'S NO TROUBLE.

27:23.567 --> 27:24.767
HE JUST SAYS HE HAS TO
CALL AND GET A SITTER.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.633
YEAH, THAT'S NO PROBLEM,
I CAN JUST DO THAT.

27:26.667 --> 27:27.933
WELL, IT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

27:27.967 --> 27:30.833
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS THIS

28:06.133 --> 28:07.867

YOU CAN'T CALL HIM NOW,
IT'S 10:45.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.067
IT'S 45 MINUTES
PAST THE CUTOFF.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.533
SO WHAT, YOU GET LIKE AN HOUR
DISPENSATION FOR GOOD NEWS.

28:14.567 --> 28:15.600
WHO TOLD YOU THAT ?

28:15.633 --> 28:17.367

28:24.867 --> 28:25.867
