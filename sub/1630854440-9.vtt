00:00.876 --> 00:03.754
Please, I just can't do this anymore.

00:03.754 --> 00:06.132
I'm spending more money than I make.

00:06.132 --> 00:09.510
I keep buying new inventory,
but I can't keep up.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.805
I'm doing everything I can to sell more,
but I'm drowning.

00:12.805 --> 00:15.099
I put in return requests
over two weeks ago.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.184
Miranda, honey,
you feel like you're drowning

00:17.184 --> 00:19.812
because you are just fighting
against the current.

00:19.812 --> 00:23.441
Uh, you just got to keep swimming
in the direction you're going.

00:23.441 --> 00:25.860
We can set you up
with a new inventory buy.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.778
I can't buy anymore.

00:29.822 --> 00:30.823
I'm pregnant.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.827
- Oh!
- Oh, well, what a blessing.

00:34.827 --> 00:37.079
That's incredible.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.039
This is even better for you.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.125
Now you can work from home.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.668
Build a life with that.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.211
â™ªMagiqBaby baby.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.005
- Hey. Great sales tool.
- Yeah.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.214
I just can't anymore.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.885
I can't. I can't.

00:53.095 --> 00:58.726
Well, if Magiq Baby is not
part of your journey right now,

00:58.726 --> 01:00.186
it's not like you're a prisoner.

01:00.186 --> 01:01.896
Mama Debra's right.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.940
Not everyone's built for success.

01:05.941 --> 01:09.111
Now, let's set you up with those returns.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.243
Wait, you think I'm a failure?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.788
Oh, sweetheart.
It doesn't matter what we think.

01:18.788 --> 01:20.873
No, what matters
is how you feel about yourself.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.377
Magiq Baby isn't just about
selling baby clothes, honey.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.505
This is about transformation.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.465
- Self-empowerment.
- Mm.

01:30.174 --> 01:33.385
You can have it all if you really want it.

01:33.385 --> 01:37.681
Miranda, do you think of yourself
as a failure?

01:37.681 --> 01:39.016
- No.
- Oh.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.101
No, I'm, I'm not a failure.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.438
I can do this.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.565
Right?

01:46.565 --> 01:49.527
Of course, you can.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.531
Honey, you can because you are family.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.741
- That's right.
- Forever.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.331
Okay.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.529
That's it.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.283
Ooh.

02:37.283 --> 02:40.244
Well, that should be enough
to reopen the schools, huh?

02:40.244 --> 02:42.371
Pay off the institution's debts?

02:42.371 --> 02:44.415
With quite a bit left over, I reckon.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.840
Who are you?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.426
Eliot, Billy the Gent.
He's an old friend.

02:55.426 --> 02:59.096
Friend, co-conspirator.
All in the name of crime, right, love?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.098
I told him to meet us here.
He said he wanted to talk.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.601
Though, I did say to wait outside.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.604
Oh, I know,
but I never see any action anymore.

03:06.604 --> 03:07.771
That's no fun.

03:08.731 --> 03:09.982
Jeez.

03:11.609 --> 03:15.279
So, darling, a mutual acquaintance
told me you were still in the game.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.823
And I wondered
if you'd be interested in a job.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.618
Mutual acquaintance?
Let me guess, is he Irish?

03:20.618 --> 03:21.869
Did he have a big mouth?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.788
The one and only, Arthur Wilde.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.750
No, no. I don't do
that kind of work anymore, Billy.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.836
But it--it's about my daughter.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.631
You remember Miranda?

03:33.631 --> 03:36.008
Oh, maybe, maybe not.
She was barely more than a baby

03:36.008 --> 03:37.718
when that whole business
with the crown went down

03:37.718 --> 03:39.720
and Arthur and I ended up in prison.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.141
Her mom brought her to stateside
while I was gone.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.310
You can't blame her for that.
Now, Miranda and I,

03:46.310 --> 03:48.854
- we're not that close...
- Is she in some kind of trouble?

03:48.854 --> 03:51.482
Yeah. She's fallen under
the spell of a scam team,

03:51.482 --> 03:52.900
in deep with an MLM.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.485
Multilevel marketing?

03:54.485 --> 03:55.903
Yeah, it is a scam.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.364
They get unpaid workers
to sell their product

03:58.364 --> 04:01.283
with a promise of moving up levels
for bigger rewards.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.744
They get them to buy more product
than they can sell

04:03.744 --> 04:06.956
and turn them into recruiting agents
for other victims.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.290
It's a pyramid scheme.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.459
Yeah. It's a legal pyramid scheme.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.920
Her mom says she's nearly bankrupt.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.172
Afraid she's on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.674
What are they called?

04:16.674 --> 04:18.676
- Magiq Baby.
- Magiq Baby?

04:19.301 --> 04:21.762
The company that sells those
cute little baby clothes.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.975
I had an ex--I had--I dated--
you know what, I don't have...

04:26.558 --> 04:29.228
Her mom asked me to help,

04:29.228 --> 04:31.814
but it's not exactly my bag.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.441
Now, Arthur said that you...

04:35.401 --> 04:39.488
are something of a do-gooder now,
and it never hurts to help an old friend.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.866
Especially one who went to prison for you.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.500
Nope.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.419
Mm-mm. I don't trust him.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.212
Hey, this guy comes out of the woodwork?

04:55.212 --> 04:57.214
Well, it sounds like the girl
could use our help.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.508
Do you have a plan?

04:59.508 --> 05:00.676
Yeah.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.554
Breanna's gonna hate it.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.182
Accountant?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.350
Seriously?

05:08.350 --> 05:12.146
This is the best use of my meticulously
honed master thievery skills?

05:12.146 --> 05:14.064
Well, at least you're not
in the food truck.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.608
They have cutting-edge security
to protect a bunch of presentations

05:16.608 --> 05:18.027
written in Comic Sans.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.653
They're pictures of babies.
What are they hiding?

05:19.653 --> 05:21.572
Plenty, I imagine.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.699
Debra Prosper.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.534
She's the face of Magiq Baby.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.619
The husband, Richard,

05:27.619 --> 05:29.121
he's run schemes like this before.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.081
He knows how to play it
right up to the edge of the law.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.916
<i>This is sus as hell.</i>

05:32.916 --> 05:35.753
The real question is,
how am I gonna get my Yes Virus on this?

05:36.837 --> 05:37.713
The Yes Virus.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.548
Once I'm in place, I hack into the system,

05:39.548 --> 05:40.883
put this little bad girl on.

05:40.883 --> 05:44.511
She automatically says yes to every
seller return request in the system.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.929
And we bankrupt the company?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.681
Yes!

05:48.474 --> 05:49.475
I'll figure it out.

05:49.475 --> 05:52.227
Don't worry,
because I am definitely not worried.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.812
How's the working stiff?

05:53.812 --> 05:55.689
She's having a bit of a Monday.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.734
<i>Hello.</i>

05:58.734 --> 06:01.653
-<i>It's 4:00 p.m., Magiq Baby family...</i>
- What?

06:01.653 --> 06:04.823
<i>...and that means it's time
for the daily baby talk.</i>

06:04.823 --> 06:06.116
-<i>Now, today...</i>
- Daily?

06:06.116 --> 06:08.368
<i>...I want y'all to think about family.</i>

06:08.952 --> 06:10.162
<i>I want you to think
about your own family...</i>

06:10.162 --> 06:11.497
As in everyday?

06:11.497 --> 06:13.916
<i>I want you to think about
your mamas and your daughters</i>

06:13.916 --> 06:17.211
<i>and your sisters, your aunts,
your cousins...</i>

06:17.211 --> 06:19.755
Every day, 4:00 p.m. on the dot.

06:19.755 --> 06:23.717
Oh, Debra is a shining beacon of light
in the darkness.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.428
She's a lighthouse
when you're in a lifeboat.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.347
A night light when you're stuck
in a little room

06:28.347 --> 06:29.598
- and you're like, "Oh, my God." And you...
- Oh, quick Q, Ronald.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.141
Um, so I'm supposed to be doing

06:31.141 --> 06:32.768
- data entry and...
- Yeah.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.938
...there's no data
and there's nowhere to enter it.

06:35.938 --> 06:39.483
Oh, uh, I see you don't have access.
I'm Sapphire level.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.944
Everything here goes by levels,
and the higher you go up,

06:41.944 --> 06:44.113
the less people have access.

06:44.113 --> 06:47.157
<i>Now, I want you to think
of yourselves as ambassadors.</i>

06:47.157 --> 06:48.742
<i>-I want you to think of yourselves...
-</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:49.993
- ...<i>as ambassadors.</i>
- Huh.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.203
So, it's like a pyramid?

06:51.203 --> 06:53.080
<i>The power to reach out
and spread the...</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:55.165
I never thought about it that way.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.626
Well, Debra and Richard,

06:57.626 --> 06:59.753
they're the only ones
with Diamond access, of course.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.631
- And they look at us from the top...
- From the top of the pyramid?

07:02.631 --> 07:05.592
I guess so. Huh.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.262
Well, if you ever need anything,
just let me know.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.680
- Okay.
- Hmm, top of the pyramid.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.224
<i>Magiq Babies come from Magiq Mamas.</i>

07:12.224 --> 07:13.517
<i>Be the magic.</i>

07:13.517 --> 07:15.727
Sounds like encrypted security keys.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.438
Uh, in-field missile launch authorization.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.649
Where'd you learn that,
Missile Launcher Monthly?

07:21.608 --> 07:24.653
All right, I need a high enough level key
to access the computers

07:24.653 --> 07:26.446
that control the return requests.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.324
Without it, I can't embed my Yes Virus.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.701
So, it's a pickpocket job.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.494
Or a pick-bracelet job.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.000
The Diamond Mama Bash
for the elite sellers,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.960
that's the perfect place to hit them.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.130
Breanna creates a cover for me
as a top UK seller,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.174
I get close to Debra, lift the key.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.593
- So, you want me to steal Richard's?
- If you could find it.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.344
It doesn't look like he always wears his.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.971
Yeah, well, I wouldn't either.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.264
Precisely.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.974
Oh, Richard.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.351
He's constantly surrounded by women,

07:56.351 --> 07:58.604
babies, feminine energy.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.314
It's confining.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.191
He needs a buddy.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.444
We'll run a friendship honeypot scam.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.778
- The bromcom.
- The bromcom.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.697
Huh? Excuse me?

08:08.697 --> 08:11.742
It's a bromcom.
It's like a romcom with dudes.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.493
Every romcom has four parts.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.622
We need a meet-cute, a sexy complication,

08:16.622 --> 08:18.957
a hook, and a joyful defeat.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.667
Basically, I got to make this guy my bro

08:20.667 --> 08:22.502
and then he shows me where the keys are.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.837
Um...

08:24.463 --> 08:26.590
actually, not you.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.554
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:32.554 --> 08:34.890
This car is awesome!

08:34.890 --> 08:37.100
Is that what you say, awesome? Boss?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.728
Bitchin'? Bad-ass?
This car is cherry. This car is tough.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.480
- Um, I can't, I can't...
- It's got to be Harry.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.524
You'd overwhelm Prosper.
He'd be way too intimidated by you.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.236
Okay? Harry's much less manly.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.571
What? Excuse me?

08:50.239 --> 08:51.198
Not a scratch.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.784
You don't drive this thing over 55.

08:53.784 --> 08:56.036
You don't drive this car
over 55 miles an hour?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.289
I drive it how I--
you don't drive it over 55.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.259
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.931
I've got a dozen people in my downline.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.432
My rebirth was the best thing that I...

09:17.432 --> 09:19.017
My downline is really...

09:19.017 --> 09:20.811
My rebirth couldn't have come sooner.

09:20.811 --> 09:21.853
All right, ladies.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.232
Be the Magiq.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.984
You're at Sapphire table five.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.319
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.493
So, I am this close to Emerald.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.954
Now, I have been stuck at Sapphire
for the past three years

09:38.954 --> 09:40.080
ever since my rebirth.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.291
I remember when I went through my rebirth.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.376
But, you know,
the new product line is going to just

09:44.376 --> 09:47.963
fly off the shelves and you'll be
at Emerald status in no time.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.590
Oh.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.218
They're all so smiley.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.512
Love bombing.
It's a proven cult technique.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.849
Though, I am curious to know
what this rebirth is.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.935
Okay. Rebirth is...

10:01.935 --> 10:04.604
when a seller is demoted back down
to the lowest level.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.189
<i>Their whole downline is taken away.</i>

10:06.189 --> 10:08.692
It's a way for Magiq Baby
to keep the seller's bonus

10:08.692 --> 10:10.944
and disguise it as a training tool.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.196
Oh, ladies.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.162
Isn't the Magiq Baby life good?

10:20.162 --> 10:21.288
Yeah!

10:21.288 --> 10:24.166
I said, isn't the Magiq Baby life good?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.591
Now, we are here to celebrate

10:32.591 --> 10:35.218
the real magic in Magiq Baby.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.180
And that is you. That is you.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.184
The person who wants
to celebrate you the most

10:42.184 --> 10:45.937
is also the person that brought
this whole family together.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.522
My wonderful,

10:47.522 --> 10:49.816
Magiqal Mama, Debra.

11:02.204 --> 11:06.541
Hello, Magiq Mamas.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.838
Uh, you are all here today, ladies,

11:11.838 --> 11:14.966
because we have all been blessed.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.844
- Yeah!
- That's right. That's right.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.347
Those negative Nancys,

11:20.347 --> 11:23.475
they like to say
that there isn't enough pie to go around.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.854
But we know,
the Magiq Mama mindset says that you...

11:29.064 --> 11:30.190
you...

11:31.316 --> 11:36.905
you have the power
to create more abundance.

11:36.905 --> 11:41.660
Y'all, there's always more pie.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.623
Hey!

11:46.623 --> 11:50.585
Magiq Babies come from Magiq Mamas.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.922
Be the Magiq!

11:53.922 --> 11:55.715
Be the Magiq.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.636
Our client Miranda's here, too.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.721
Remember, she doesn't know
we're here to help her.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.683
Want me to broom her,
dump her in Venezuela?

12:04.683 --> 12:07.519
No, but keep an eye on her.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.604
We know she's emotionally fragile.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.064
<i>Will do.</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:13.984
Next step, Breanna, set the meet-cute.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.153
We are going to be giving out prizes.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.071
I know y'all like prizes.

12:18.071 --> 12:23.326
One special lady will be getting
a pink and blue Cadillac.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.962
Can I help you?

12:44.890 --> 12:47.058
Sorry, is that a little loud?

12:47.684 --> 12:49.269
I'm trying to figure this out.

12:49.936 --> 12:53.607
Well, these high-flow catalytic converters
will break your heart.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.150
You know these cars?

12:55.650 --> 12:56.526
Well...

12:57.110 --> 12:59.863
- You mind getting your hands dirty?
- Oh...

13:01.031 --> 13:02.115
not at all.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.578
<i>Good. Now flirt with him.</i>

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
- Come again?
- Flirting is the key ingredient

13:09.289 --> 13:11.166
to the meet-cute.
It's all about the chemistry.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.375
Bow chicka wow wow.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.169
Sorry, did you say something?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.170
Nope.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.966
Yeah, that's nice wrench work.

13:19.966 --> 13:20.967
Well...

13:20.967 --> 13:23.011
You know your way around
a Hemi V8 engine.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.681
I've always had a keen interest
in high-performance automobiles.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.683
Okay. Give her a try.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.605
<i>-</i>
- Whoo! Yeah!

13:33.605 --> 13:35.815
I've been trying to get her
to do that all day.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.610
Well, like a high-performance woman,

13:38.610 --> 13:40.153
it takes a delicate touch.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.948
<i>Great job, Harry.</i>

13:42.948 --> 13:44.407
Now, for part two,

13:44.407 --> 13:47.410
the sexy complication.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.537
Thanks for the help.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.750
You, uh, wanna take her for a spin?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.168
Oh? Well...

13:56.086 --> 13:59.798
I think the missus can handle things here
for a little while.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.300
Let's go.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.637
Mama Prosper,

14:05.637 --> 14:07.639
I'm such a fan.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.640
Oh.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.768
Oh! Margaret Bentley.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.105
I've come all the way from the UK
to upgrade my mindset.

14:15.105 --> 14:18.775
I just know I'm not meant to be stuck
at Sapphire, Mama, forever.

14:19.401 --> 14:20.277
From the UK?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.611
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.573
I could swear I heard a touch of Boston
in your accent.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.699
Oh?

14:25.699 --> 14:28.827
Well, I have spent some time there.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.328
Hmm.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.955
Attention, mamas.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.249
- Excuse me, Magiq Mamas.
- Oh.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.544
This here is Sapphire mama,

14:37.544 --> 14:40.672
Margaret Bentley,
joining us all the way from the UK.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.593
And she's gonna tell us
the five Magiq keys

14:44.593 --> 14:46.595
to enrichment and success.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.222
Now, every Sapphire mama
should know these by heart.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.557
Oh, lights.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.602
Oh. Ah.

15:04.988 --> 15:05.989
Oh.

15:08.366 --> 15:09.868
Here you go. Come on, then.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.287
All right. Just give me a sec.
I'm looking it up now.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.914
Don't bother.

15:15.832 --> 15:16.958
Excuse me?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.336
Don't bother...

15:20.587 --> 15:23.673
with the five steps...

15:24.257 --> 15:27.177
if you're just repeating from memory.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.179
Magiq Baby isn't about reciting.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.930
It's about a way of life.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.392
It's about enrichment as a family.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.145
And the five steps
are how we begin this journey.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.938
Let's do it together.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.315
Step one.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.733
Set a goal.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.653
For yourself, for our company,
for our future.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.071
Step two...

15:46.071 --> 15:47.656
Be strategic.

15:47.656 --> 15:51.451
Confidence comes from knowing
how you're gonna accomplish your goals.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.663
- And...
- Oh. You tell us the rest, honey.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.668
Step three, stay organized.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.878
Four, keep focused.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.298
And the most important of all the steps,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.425
rejoice!

16:12.055 --> 16:13.556
<i>How did you know all that?</i>

16:13.556 --> 16:17.977
Those are the basic tenants
of a dozen self-help success manuals.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.189
Nice job winging it.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.899
But I got to tell you,
fake it till you make it

16:22.899 --> 16:26.194
is not gonna work here at Magiq Baby.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.197
Ooh. She's good.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.157
She saw right through me.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.076
We're gonna have to step up our game.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.619
Breanna, any luck?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.579
Ronald moved me up to Sapphire access

16:36.579 --> 16:38.498
and somehow it's worse.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.085
It's like they Frankensteined a dozen
different accounting programs together.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.838
And I still can't get
to the seller request records.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.464
Ah!

16:46.464 --> 16:47.966
God!

16:47.966 --> 16:50.677
I just can't stop thinking about
what you said about those pyramids.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.636
Okay.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.055
Because our financial structure
works the same way.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.808
You work your way up
by adding more people under you.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.436
And the real revenue
doesn't come from sales.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.022
Recruitment is actually kind of

17:03.022 --> 17:05.275
the only way a seller makes profit.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.279
So, it might be a pyramid scheme?

17:09.279 --> 17:11.990
No. No. It can't be.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.159
No.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.497
Oh, Ronald.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.298
Parker, I'm gonna need your help
getting Debra's attention again.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.632
You got it. What you thinking?

17:29.632 --> 17:32.719
I'm thinking a blessed event.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.429
Hmm.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.227
I'm just so overwhelmed.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.813
I know. Oh, it's tough.

17:43.813 --> 17:48.485
The pregnancy and taking on
extra catering jobs.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.487
Magiq Baby would be perfect for you.

17:50.487 --> 17:54.365
I could put you in my downline
and set you up today.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.450
Really?

17:55.450 --> 17:57.494
Oh, I'd love a chance to get off my feet

17:57.494 --> 18:00.955
and just relax
before a little Alec arrives.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.875
Well, it sounds like
the Magiq Baby family

18:03.875 --> 18:05.752
is about to get a little bigger.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.295
Oh, my goodness.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.506
The Debra Prosper.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.424
It is such an honor.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.593
- I should get back to work now.
- Oh.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.179
You know, I looked into you

18:16.179 --> 18:19.015
- and your numbers are very impressive.
- Oh.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.351
And, you know,
I really like that salesmanship.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.521
I always tell my girls
that a stranger is just...

18:25.063 --> 18:27.649
...a Magiq Baby seller
you haven't met yet.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.778
Miranda, honey, come here.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.114
This is amazing.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.368
This weekend is--it's everything I needed.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.537
Oh. You do need this.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.913
But that's not all you need, is it?

18:41.913 --> 18:46.793
No. I think that you need
a little Magiq Baby love.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.128
Mamas, come here.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.798
Gather round. This here is Miranda.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.967
And she has recently struggled

18:53.967 --> 18:56.135
with negativity in her mindset.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.138
But she has chosen to persevere

18:59.138 --> 19:02.433
and not let that negativity stop her

19:02.433 --> 19:04.936
from being the Magiq.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.988
Oh, I'm so proud of her.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.283
But, you know, I can't help but wonder
if there isn't something more

19:18.283 --> 19:20.451
that we can do to help you.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.079
What do you think, Margaret?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.831
Is there something more that we could do

19:24.831 --> 19:27.750
to help Miranda reach her full potential?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.252
Sophie, she's testing you.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.547
Uh, maybe she could use something

19:32.547 --> 19:34.841
to help reenergize her.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.469
Uh, how about a rebirth?

19:39.804 --> 19:41.681
A rebirth?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.850
No. No.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.020
I've already invested so much
to get to the level that I'm at.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.146
- I don't think that's...
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, honey.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.023
That is just negativity creeping in there.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.318
Sometimes you have to go back
to go forward.

19:53.318 --> 19:56.195
Everyone, let's congratulate Miranda

19:56.195 --> 19:58.156
on her rebirth.

20:09.125 --> 20:13.046
That is exactly what I would've done.
You know the secret, my friend.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.423
Magiq takes sacrifice.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.092
If it was easy,
everyone could do it, right?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.093
Mm-hmm.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.764
Why don't you come on up
to my penthouse with me

20:22.764 --> 20:24.182
and have a little chat?

20:24.182 --> 20:26.476
I want to sit down
and get to know you better.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.021
I would love that, Debra.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.529
Parker, check on Miranda.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.490
I did what I had to do.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.246
Hi.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.539
Uh, I don't have a tissue,

20:48.539 --> 20:50.291
but, uh, you can use my sleeve.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.919
I'm fine. Thank you.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.424
How far along are you?

20:59.217 --> 21:03.054
Oh. About forty--four--
fourteen months.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.474
Yeah. I guess it could feel
like that sometimes.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.435
Oh, your eyes are leaking again.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.145
You sure you don't want my sleeve?

21:11.145 --> 21:13.690
You know,
I just don't think I could do this.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.985
I'm pregnant too and I don't...

21:18.486 --> 21:21.906
I don't think I could handle
everything falling apart right now.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.034
I was--I was going broke before

21:25.034 --> 21:28.663
and now I have to start all over again.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.124
And you're worried that you're a loser?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.253
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.047
Hey, hey, you don't have to worry
about being a loser.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.341
I don't?

21:40.341 --> 21:42.677
- Why?
- Because you are a loser.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.220
What?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.431
But so are everybody else in this room.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.891
Look, according to the FTC,

21:48.891 --> 21:52.311
99% of people in MLMs lose their money.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.939
And only a measly 1% make a profit.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.191
- Is that true?
- Oh, yeah. You can Google it.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.944
So, why worry about being a loser when...

22:01.070 --> 22:03.072
that's exactly what you signed up for?

22:04.949 --> 22:05.950
Thanks.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.495
Oh.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.416
In case you need this later.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.210
Thanks.

22:16.210 --> 22:20.423
The price was negotiated objectively,

22:20.423 --> 22:22.592
so if you choose to renege

22:22.592 --> 22:23.843
on the deal,

22:24.886 --> 22:26.512
you will regret it.

22:31.142 --> 22:34.604
Hey, Eliot,
have you ever tried selling Russians

22:34.604 --> 22:36.355
a truckload of microwaves?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.066
They don't like hot food.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.068
I was under the impression
you weren't in the game anymore.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.278
Does anyone ever really leave?

22:43.529 --> 22:45.490
What's got you sneaking up on me?

22:45.490 --> 22:46.824
This isn't sneaking.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.618
This is lurking.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.161
- A big difference.
- Oh, yeah?

22:50.161 --> 22:51.204
Oh, let me guess.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.956
You're here to tell me
that you care for...

22:54.624 --> 22:56.417
What's she go by now? Sophie?

22:56.417 --> 22:59.212
And, uh, you're here to protect her.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.546
Well, strike two.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.924
However, all those things
you just said are true,

23:02.924 --> 23:05.218
but that's not why I'm here.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.053
All right, then.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.137
Why are you here?

23:08.846 --> 23:10.515
Because you're gonna tell me
everything you know

23:10.515 --> 23:14.018
about what happened back in the day
with Sophie,

23:14.018 --> 23:17.688
with Arthur, the duke, you.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.148
All of it.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.201
Can't talk about <i>Dirty Harry</i>
without talking <i>High Plains Drifter</i>.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.452
Right, <i>A Fistful of Dollars.</i>

23:31.452 --> 23:34.247
Ooh. <i>Good, Bad, and the Ugly.</i>

23:34.247 --> 23:37.083
Yeah. This is what I call a proper office.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.502
Well, this is just my one in Louisiana.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.629
I got offices on the coasts and in Europe.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.256
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.258
<i>So, he's brought you back to his place.</i>

23:45.258 --> 23:46.551
<i>You're gonna need him to open up.</i>

23:46.551 --> 23:49.178
It's time for the hook.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.847
Talk about something that make men cry.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.516
- Ah.
- You got great taste.

23:53.516 --> 23:54.475
Well, thank you.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.478
You know, this place
kind of reminds me of, uh...

23:58.229 --> 24:00.398
Well, it, kind of, reminds me
of my old man's office.

24:00.398 --> 24:01.524
God rest his soul.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.776
Oh, I'm sorry. Mine passed, too.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.946
- Oh.
- Never had an office, working stiff.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.323
But I always imagined that if he had one,

24:09.323 --> 24:11.200
he'd want it to look just like this.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.618
Yeah.

24:13.578 --> 24:14.745
It's nearly perfect.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.373
- Nearly?
- Well, all we need is a bottle of brandy

24:17.373 --> 24:19.083
and some Cuban cigars.

24:20.418 --> 24:24.213
How's a bottle of Louis XIII
and some Cohiba sound to you?

24:24.213 --> 24:25.631
Whoo!

24:25.631 --> 24:27.800
No sign of the bracelet yet.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.469
But he does have a wall safe.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.512
Is it digital?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.849
No. Old-school combination.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.058
Whoo!

24:36.058 --> 24:37.351
Oh. Now I'm getting all flushed.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.519
Harry, I'm coming your way.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.563
I gotta hide this from Debra,

24:40.563 --> 24:43.024
so I keep it in the safe.

24:43.774 --> 24:44.817
Wise.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.944
Hmm.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.779
Pregnant bellies are so great
at hiding stuff.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.907
No one ever talks about that.

24:50.907 --> 24:54.243
When the authorities found out
that the Maharaja's crown was a fake,

24:54.243 --> 24:56.495
our heist of the original was revealed.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.415
They went back and found me
on some security footage

24:59.415 --> 25:01.083
driving the getaway car.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.794
And you think Sophie told them
the crown was fake?

25:03.794 --> 25:06.297
Absolutely not.
What benefit would there be?

25:06.297 --> 25:08.633
- Well, what's your beef with her?
- I don't have one.

25:08.633 --> 25:11.219
It's my own fault for having
such a characteristic nose.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.429
You can catch it on a CCTV, honestly.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.640
What about Arthur Wilde?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.850
Oh. Yeah.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.478
Well, that's a little more complicated.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.731
We were a team. All right?

25:23.731 --> 25:25.983
This was our boldest heist yet.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.778
When it went south, then someone
higher up on the food chain

25:28.778 --> 25:30.905
than just the driver
had to take some heat.

25:30.905 --> 25:35.243
Arthur felt like your Sophie threw him
under the bus to save her own skin.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.702
And why would she do that?

25:36.702 --> 25:39.580
Well, she was marrying a duke, wasn't she?

25:39.580 --> 25:42.458
I mean, that's, that's right posh.
That's not a put-on anymore.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.253
She wasn't about to jeopardize that.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.964
And she let you take the fall?

25:47.964 --> 25:51.175
Nah. I was going down regardless.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.969
But Arthur,

25:52.969 --> 25:56.305
maybe she could have whispered
in the right ears to spare him.

25:56.305 --> 26:00.601
Honestly, with their history,
it was a bit cruel leaving him to rot.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.273
This doesn't sound like Sophie to me.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.567
Oh, yeah.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.861
You've known her for years.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.655
You believe her. You trust her.

26:12.655 --> 26:16.617
Well, I knew her for a long time, too.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.120
Only I didn't forget
that she's a con woman.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.707
Professional liar,
deceiving people for a living.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.335
Even the people closest to her.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.796
So, I finally told him,

26:28.796 --> 26:31.507
"Fine. Richard, you can have
your little man cave."

26:32.925 --> 26:35.845
I had to get him out from under
my feet every now and again, huh?

26:35.845 --> 26:37.305
Oh.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.934
You are so confiding.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.271
It's just wonderful
to get this chance to know you.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.815
Oh, well, thank you. But, Margaret...

26:48.482 --> 26:51.444
Margie, we're here to learn about you.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.488
Tell me, how did Magiq Baby
come into your life, huh?

26:54.488 --> 26:59.452
Oh. Well,
it's not the happiest of stories.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.871
It was just a bad relationship.

27:04.874 --> 27:05.875
Oh.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.837
He had me on a string, like a puppet.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.549
But I decided, no, that was not how
my story was gonna go.

27:13.549 --> 27:14.550
So, I left him.

27:14.550 --> 27:18.763
It was hard, but I knew I deserved better.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.892
And then I discovered Magiq Baby.

27:22.892 --> 27:26.312
And I turned my life around
in three months.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.482
I just don't know where I'd be without it.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.152
Hmm, good story.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.946
Probably helped you convince
a lot of buyers, huh?

27:37.281 --> 27:38.908
Joanne?

27:38.908 --> 27:41.035
Do you remember what I said
when you told me

27:41.035 --> 27:42.495
how you came to Magiq Baby?

27:43.204 --> 27:45.706
Oh, yes.

27:45.706 --> 27:49.543
You said that if I didn't
wanna take this seriously,

27:49.543 --> 27:51.462
the door was right there.

27:51.462 --> 27:52.546
Yep.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.549
'Cause Jo-Jo here lied to me.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.510
Just like you did, Margie.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.055
I got a knack for catching lies.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.849
<i>A family this big, we can't be dishonest
with each other.</i>

28:03.849 --> 28:07.144
She's so scary, like a human lie detector.

28:07.144 --> 28:09.355
Which means Sophie can't lie to her.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.068
You got me.

28:14.068 --> 28:15.152
Yeah.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.279
You're quite perceptive, aren't you?

28:17.780 --> 28:20.408
Ladies, what do I always say
about the levels?

28:20.408 --> 28:23.160
- You don't level up if you don't open up.
- You don't level up if you don't open up.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.537
That's right.

28:24.537 --> 28:28.249
Oh, I just want everyone at Magiq Baby
to achieve their full potential.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.960
And that is why I push so hard.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.046
You know, the pressure
is where diamonds come from.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.508
So, Margie...

28:38.968 --> 28:40.386
the truth.

28:41.303 --> 28:44.932
I can't help but feel that you have

28:44.932 --> 28:48.102
or had someone in your life that...

28:49.437 --> 28:51.647
really changed things for you.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.692
Tell me about him.

28:59.822 --> 29:03.159
- Ronald!
- So, Debra says the Magiq Baby way

29:03.159 --> 29:05.786
is the only way for people
to achieve their dreams.

29:05.786 --> 29:09.457
You build, you move up,
and you get what you want.

29:09.457 --> 29:12.084
And that's good, right?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.086
I don't--I don't know.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.754
Is that what you want?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.340
You want a polo shirt
and a cheap bracelet?

29:18.340 --> 29:19.717
Not really.

29:19.717 --> 29:21.469
And my bracelet was $200.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.387
They make you pay for those? Yikes.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.473
The higher up you go, they want even more.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.725
Ronald, what is the dream?

29:27.725 --> 29:29.810
Oh, it's silly.

29:29.810 --> 29:32.104
- Come on.
- No, I couldn't.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.064
- No, you could tell me.
- I play the trumpet.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.649
I always wanted to be a jazz man.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.277
You know...
It's crazy.

29:38.944 --> 29:39.904
That's, that's cool as hell, man.

29:39.904 --> 29:42.907
Actually, hey,
so I've been trying to reconcile

29:42.907 --> 29:45.409
some of this third-quarter data,

29:45.409 --> 29:46.827
and I was just wondering, um,

29:46.827 --> 29:49.288
how do you deal
with seller return requests?

29:49.288 --> 29:52.082
Oh, that's all overseen
by Debra and Richard only.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.168
They like to make it
a face-to-face meeting.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.420
Hmm. So, you have to get
all the way to the top

29:56.420 --> 29:58.297
to get out of the company?

29:58.297 --> 29:59.882
Yeah.

29:59.882 --> 30:04.011
All returns are done via Debra's computer

30:04.011 --> 30:08.432
in the penthouse,
in case you were curious.

30:09.517 --> 30:10.518
I'm going to lunch.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.194
Oh, that's...

30:20.194 --> 30:22.279
Harry. I'm here,

30:22.279 --> 30:23.614
you and Richard should not be.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.075
<i>Clear him out.</i>

30:26.075 --> 30:29.078
Hey, uh, we ought to, uh,
get up to something.

30:29.078 --> 30:32.164
Maybe go hit the cages or the links.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.999
You know, I'm a member
over at Bradgebriar.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.545
You strike me as the kind of man
that appreciates history, am I right?

30:37.545 --> 30:40.339
I never met a World War II documentary
I wouldn't watch.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.634
Well, I'm about to take you back
a little further than that.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.386
Come on, it's upstairs.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.063
Huh.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.734
So, we need to upload your Yes Virus
directly to Debra's computer?

31:00.734 --> 31:01.694
Yep.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.321
And the only way to get onto her computer
is with their keys.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.615
- Any luck?
- Ugh.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.742
It smells like dude in here.

31:10.661 --> 31:11.745
Ah.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.001
Hmm. I got gold bars, a few Rolexes,

31:17.918 --> 31:21.130
land contract
written in what looks like Uzbek,

31:21.130 --> 31:22.506
Mark McGwire rookie card,

31:22.506 --> 31:24.800
but no bracelet and no security key.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.303
Got to admit, you're piquing my curiosity.

31:27.303 --> 31:31.599
Welcome to my manne hule.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.976
It's Norwegian for man cave.

31:33.976 --> 31:38.063
Cost a fortune, but naturally,
it's all on the company dime.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.529
Oh.

31:46.322 --> 31:48.490
- Yeah!
- Yes, sir.

31:48.490 --> 31:52.494
This... this is incredible.

31:52.494 --> 31:55.831
Well, I just needed a place to be myself.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.542
You know, get away
from all the estrogen in the building.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.585
Hear that.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.253
Now,

32:02.087 --> 32:05.132
how about a friendly fight?

32:05.132 --> 32:07.051
What's that now?

32:07.051 --> 32:09.595
Yeah.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.139
You see, we're warriors.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.975
And this world, it's gone soft.

32:14.975 --> 32:19.063
And we're meant to strive, to fight,

32:19.063 --> 32:23.692
to defeat our enemies
and when we reap the rewards,

32:23.692 --> 32:27.196
to feast in Valhalla.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.156
Yeah, totally.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.867
All right. That's yours.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.036
- Really?
- Yes.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.746
All right.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.915
So this is really...

32:37.915 --> 32:40.417
- This is really happening?
- Oh, yes, sir.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.836
I've got eyes on the bracelet.
Third floor, man cave.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.089
Things are getting a little weird up here.

32:45.089 --> 32:48.092
- Ha. Ha.
- Ha. Ha.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.177
- Ha!
- Holy crap.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.262
- Okay.
- Oh, that's it.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.639
Oh, you feel that?

32:53.639 --> 32:56.100
Feel that blood
just flowing through your veins?

32:56.100 --> 32:57.601
We're conquerors.

32:57.601 --> 33:00.771
Okay!

33:16.704 --> 33:19.039
I'm not a patient person.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.999
If you're not gonna be truthful...

33:22.126 --> 33:24.628
He was a lot of things,

33:24.628 --> 33:27.423
but mostly, he was a planner.

33:28.716 --> 33:31.343
He could see everything...

33:32.594 --> 33:34.304
from every angle.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.140
But he couldn't always see himself, huh?

33:36.724 --> 33:39.685
Those were the moments
where he might miss a step,

33:39.685 --> 33:43.230
but that got better after we got together.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.316
And then the plans we made became about us

33:46.316 --> 33:48.736
and all the things
we were gonna do together.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.364
And then he had to go and die,

33:52.364 --> 33:53.615
mess up the whole plan.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.952
But we have a family,

33:56.952 --> 33:59.872
and it's my responsibility
to take care of them.

33:59.872 --> 34:02.207
Maybe I'm not enough without him,

34:02.207 --> 34:05.335
<i>but I have to be there for them.</i>

34:05.335 --> 34:10.132
<i>Everything I do is for them.</i>

34:19.767 --> 34:21.935
What's that?

34:35.032 --> 34:36.283
That fell out of your ear?

34:36.283 --> 34:39.495
That's, uh, that's my hearing aid.

34:39.495 --> 34:42.748
Too many years around loud engines,
you know?

34:42.748 --> 34:46.126
Now that story smells like the truth.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.881
And it felt good, didn't it?

34:50.881 --> 34:52.508
Hmm?

34:52.508 --> 34:53.967
To get that out.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.429
Actually, yeah.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.057
Ladies, could you give us
some privacy, please?

35:00.057 --> 35:03.977
Allow Margaret here the space
to really express herself.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.565
Okay.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.567
It's just you and me now.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.906
You don't have to hold anything back.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.746
Oh. What are you doing?

35:22.746 --> 35:24.289
This leads to the restricted zone.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.124
Oh. [blows raspberry] I'm so sorry.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.709
I was looking for the restroom.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.253
There are plenty of restrooms
back that way.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.879
How did you end up all the way over here?

35:30.879 --> 35:32.756
You don't have to worry about her.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.132
She probably just got lost.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.134
- Yeah.
- You know this woman?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.886
Yeah. We were just talking a moment ago.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.180
- She's gonna be a mom soon.
- Mm-hmm.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.598
What happened to your belly?

35:41.598 --> 35:44.309
Oh. Oh. Oh.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.229
There is a perfectly
good explanation for this.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.942
Yeah, loud engines.

35:52.943 --> 35:55.279
That'll do it to you.

35:55.279 --> 35:57.030
Let me get that for you, old man.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.115
Hey, let me get that.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.576
<i>So I made a fake belly,</i>

36:00.576 --> 36:04.788
<i>so that I could get into the mindset
of being pregnant, you know?</i>

36:04.788 --> 36:07.499
Hearing aids don't usually talk to you.

36:08.417 --> 36:11.545
I had to pay extra for that feature.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.882
I bet you did.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.557
I hope you fight better than you lie.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.601
Fortunately,
I've had good teachers in both.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.981
What? Harry gets a sword fight
and I get stuck in a cubicle?

36:30.981 --> 36:33.483
Uh-uh. You know what? Whatever.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.235
I have to get to Debra's computer.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.866
Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.

36:43.243 --> 36:44.703
Breanna, I didn't go to lunch.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.455
I went home and picked up my trumpet.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.457
There's no pyramid schemes in jazz!

36:48.457 --> 36:50.459
Whoo! Ha-ha!

36:50.459 --> 36:51.460
Follow your dreams.

37:03.639 --> 37:06.183
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy
beating the truth out of you.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.225
You want some truth?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.311
Your brandy's watered down
and your Cubans are fakes.

37:13.607 --> 37:14.524
Damn it!

37:19.029 --> 37:21.073
Ooh!

37:32.417 --> 37:34.878
Oh, you did not!

37:34.878 --> 37:36.797
Part four of the bromcom,

37:36.797 --> 37:38.465
the joyous defeat.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.511
I don't understand what you want from me.

37:42.511 --> 37:46.223
- I just told you.
- No. You told me a truth,

37:46.223 --> 37:47.933
but not the truth.

37:47.933 --> 37:51.895
No, not the one that keeps you up
at night. Now you are so close now.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.146
Don't give up.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.774
All right, Debra.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.235
I'll tell you a secret.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.116
Something I've never told anyone.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.330
Not something that happened to you,

38:10.330 --> 38:12.874
like your husband dying, huh?

38:12.874 --> 38:15.127
This is about something that you did,

38:15.127 --> 38:18.547
something that you hold
a lot of guilt about.

38:21.758 --> 38:25.178
There was someone who trusted me,

38:25.178 --> 38:27.264
who relied on me to protect them.

38:28.849 --> 38:32.352
And I took that responsibility
for granted.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.980
And when it came to making a choice,

38:34.980 --> 38:37.274
whether to stay or to leave,

38:37.274 --> 38:39.109
I chose to leave.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.694
I abandoned them.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.780
I chose to take care of myself.

38:46.575 --> 38:48.910
And it's not just that I did that,
that I made that choice.

38:48.910 --> 38:52.873
It's that I know
it should have haunted me,

38:52.873 --> 38:56.585
that a good person would have thought

38:56.585 --> 38:58.420
about what they'd done every day since.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.922
But the truth is, I haven't.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.382
I moved on.

39:03.884 --> 39:06.762
I lived my life in such a way that I...

39:07.387 --> 39:09.014
I couldn't look back.

39:09.890 --> 39:13.685
I couldn't think
about what I'd done to them.

39:14.603 --> 39:17.397
I dug a hole in myself,

39:17.397 --> 39:18.982
and I put this person in it,

39:18.982 --> 39:21.401
and I made myself forget,

39:21.401 --> 39:23.028
and it worked.

39:24.821 --> 39:27.491
The truth hurts.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.494
And that is how we know it's true.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.412
Just like your truth.

39:32.412 --> 39:34.581
- Mine?
- Yes, Debra.

39:34.581 --> 39:37.417
You see, I'm a bit of a lie detector also.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.503
And I've been listening
to your bollocks all day.

39:40.754 --> 39:43.090
You don't raise people up.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.050
You keep them down.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.344
You manipulate them.

39:47.344 --> 39:51.848
You sell them this promise
of untold wealth and independence,

39:51.848 --> 39:55.644
and then you suck them dry
and move on to new victims.

39:55.644 --> 39:58.563
- Mm.
- You call Magiq Baby a family

39:58.563 --> 40:01.233
'cause you can't call it
what it really is,

40:01.233 --> 40:03.110
- just a pyramid scheme.
- Oh.

40:03.110 --> 40:06.696
Run by a cheap grifter
in expensive jewelry.

40:06.696 --> 40:10.951
Well, I knew something
was off about you.

40:10.951 --> 40:14.538
Yeah, I figured I'd call you up here
and see if I was on the money.

40:17.374 --> 40:19.042
Oh.

40:19.042 --> 40:22.003
And what if Magiq Baby
is a pyramid scheme, hmm?

40:23.255 --> 40:27.384
Well, all that would mean is...
that there are a lot of people below me

40:27.384 --> 40:29.928
lifting me up who won't let me fall.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.348
And I know they won't, no,
because I take money from them every day

40:33.348 --> 40:35.517
and they love me for it.

40:35.517 --> 40:36.935
Yeah.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.563
They want me to tell them what to do,
what to think.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.523
They, they, they need me

40:41.523 --> 40:44.776
to tell them who they are.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.945
You see, they give me money

40:46.945 --> 40:49.030
and I provide a service.

40:49.030 --> 40:53.451
Without me,
there's no magic in their lives.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.496
Oh, without me, they are nothing.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.750
Now, do you remember
what we talked about earlier,

41:00.750 --> 41:03.003
diamonds and pressure?

41:03.920 --> 41:08.091
Well, we're about to see
how much pressure you can take.

41:09.259 --> 41:11.052
Security!

41:18.768 --> 41:22.564
You're not the first one to come in here

41:22.564 --> 41:24.774
and think she could
ride herd on me.

41:24.774 --> 41:28.570
No. This ain't my first rodeo.

41:28.570 --> 41:31.615
But you are about to see what it's like
to get stomped on by the bull.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.201
Why are you smiling?

41:35.076 --> 41:38.121
Just because everything you just said

41:38.121 --> 41:39.331
smells like the truth.

41:39.331 --> 41:40.665
Mm.

41:41.708 --> 41:42.709
Where the hell is my security?

41:42.709 --> 41:44.294
Security!

41:44.294 --> 41:46.504
You kept me talking for ages.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.548
Uh, Do you--do you have the time,
by the way?

41:49.132 --> 41:50.467
The time is...

41:54.471 --> 41:59.517
Because just about every Magiq Baby seller
you have is tuned in

41:59.517 --> 42:02.312
to a very special edition of Baby Talk.

42:02.312 --> 42:03.730
<i>I take money from them every day</i>

42:03.730 --> 42:05.815
<i>and they love me for it.</i>

42:05.815 --> 42:08.652
<i>Yeah, they, they, they need me</i>

42:08.652 --> 42:11.488
<i>to tell them who they are.</i>

42:11.488 --> 42:13.782
<i>Without me, they are nothing.</i>

42:15.408 --> 42:17.202
<i>Be the Magiq.</i>

42:22.999 --> 42:25.293
Hey! Those are expensive.

42:27.754 --> 42:30.882
No. No. No, no.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.552
No, no, no, no.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.890
Are you, uh, getting
some constructive feedback?

42:42.227 --> 42:45.021
- Richard! Come on.
- Yeah! Yeah.

42:45.021 --> 42:47.941
Here. Here. Okay. Okay.

42:52.404 --> 42:55.907
Thank you so much for plugging my key
into your system.

42:56.408 --> 42:58.451
It's so nice to have a boss
that supports you.

43:17.304 --> 43:19.222
- What did you do?
- Uh...

43:20.098 --> 43:21.850
- What did you do?
- What? I didn't.

43:21.850 --> 43:23.810
I was playing.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.812
Oh. You dumb son of a bitch.
Just go clean up this.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.105
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'll call the helicopter.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.441
Sorry, we're late. Mom stuff.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.235
So, you wouldn't just jump in
to having a baby?

43:32.235 --> 43:33.862
You practice first.

43:33.862 --> 43:34.863
Nope.

43:37.615 --> 43:41.077
Perfectly a good explanation
for this, too.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.705
Don't wanna ruin any cool getaways,

43:43.705 --> 43:45.749
but I wouldn't bother going for that safe.

43:47.667 --> 43:49.586
Shh. She's sleeping.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.759
Ha-ha! And since in about three minutes
all your cash is gonna be gone,

43:55.759 --> 43:59.429
your hard assets are gonna be liquidated
to cover any outstanding debts,

43:59.429 --> 44:00.930
of which there will be many.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.183
But don't worry,
it's gonna be a quick and easy process.

44:03.183 --> 44:07.020
Since you threw an axe at me,
I made a few calls to expedite things.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.732
No, no, no, no, no, no.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.738
No!

44:16.738 --> 44:19.240
Not my humidor! no!

44:19.240 --> 44:20.784
By the way,

44:20.784 --> 44:23.370
my Yes Virus also said yes to me
having access

44:23.370 --> 44:25.163
to your whole entire system,

44:25.163 --> 44:27.874
so now I have proof that you two
are running a pyramid scheme.

44:27.874 --> 44:30.960
Department of Justice
really frowns on that kind of thing.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.546
I think they might be
stopping by here soon.

44:42.305 --> 44:44.140
No.

44:50.397 --> 44:53.274
Think of it as a rebirth.

44:57.570 --> 45:00.824
That story about the person
you abandoned...

45:02.075 --> 45:03.535
it was a daughter, wasn't it?

45:15.130 --> 45:17.966
- So all's well that ends well?
- Yeah. My Yes Virus kicked in

45:17.966 --> 45:20.844
and not only did everyone
who requested a return get one,

45:20.844 --> 45:23.430
each and every Magiq Baby mama
got a nice bonus.

45:23.430 --> 45:24.973
Hey. All right.

45:24.973 --> 45:27.600
Miranda should have enough left over
to get some much needed help.

45:27.600 --> 45:31.438
They are gonna have a hard time
selling baby clothes from prison.

45:31.438 --> 45:34.732
Although, I have met some babies
who belong in prison.

45:34.732 --> 45:35.984
You like wearing that thing?

45:35.984 --> 45:38.236
Oh, yeah. This is great.

45:38.236 --> 45:39.571
I might wear it all the time.

45:39.571 --> 45:42.490
People get out of my way
and I can store snacks and stuff.

45:42.490 --> 45:43.575
There you go.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.785
Oh, Harry.

45:45.785 --> 45:48.121
God, that armor doesn't breathe, does it?

45:48.121 --> 45:51.207
No, it doesn't, but I'm keeping it.

45:51.207 --> 45:54.043
Cheers.

45:54.544 --> 45:57.672
All I got to do now is clean up
Eliot's car before he gets back.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.924
Apparently, Richard spilled beer
in the cup holders.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.759
Where are Sophie and Eliot anyway?

46:01.759 --> 46:03.470
On an errand.

46:03.470 --> 46:05.096
Mm. Who are we listening to?

46:05.096 --> 46:06.598
Oh, that's Ronald. He's cool.

46:06.598 --> 46:07.599
He's pretty good.

46:25.492 --> 46:28.578
Oh, hey. [chuckles] I just got off
the phone with Miranda's mom.

46:28.578 --> 46:31.122
- Oh.
- She's as pleased as punch with me.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.166
Said I could even buy her a drink
when I'm in town.

46:33.917 --> 46:36.252
When did you learn to speak Uzbek?

46:36.252 --> 46:37.295
What do you mean?

46:37.295 --> 46:40.548
This has been about that land
in Uzbekistan

46:40.548 --> 46:42.926
that the Prospers had.

46:42.926 --> 46:46.304
My colleague found the contract
in Richard's safe.

46:49.682 --> 46:51.726
You weren't speaking Russian on the phone.

46:52.268 --> 46:53.728
It was Uzbek.

46:53.728 --> 46:57.190
Well, one of my cellmates was Uzbeki.

46:57.190 --> 46:59.734
His accent was so thick,
it was easy to learn

46:59.734 --> 47:02.320
and try and decipher
what he was saying in English.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.114
So between Miranda and the Uzbek,

47:05.114 --> 47:08.743
you were the perfect person
for this job to lure me in.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.162
Yeah, but you really did help my daughter.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.206
And for that, I am eternally grateful.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.415
Oh.

47:14.415 --> 47:18.294
But... an interested party thought

47:18.294 --> 47:22.549
the land would make a better runway
than a warehouse for cheap baby clothes.

47:23.424 --> 47:24.968
Two birds and all that.

47:24.968 --> 47:26.719
An interested party?

47:27.345 --> 47:30.014
- You talking about Wilde?
- No.

47:30.932 --> 47:33.017
If this is about a runway,

47:33.017 --> 47:35.603
then it's for Ramsey,

47:35.603 --> 47:38.231
which means you're still working for him.

47:38.231 --> 47:40.275
Does anyone ever really leave?

47:47.907 --> 47:50.285
You know, think of it this way.

47:50.285 --> 47:53.246
He's very grateful
for the favor you've done him.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.250
Who the hell is Ramsey?

47:57.250 --> 48:01.754
Someone who I very much hoped
thought I was dead.

48:46.716 --> 48:50.428
Emma came up with a piece of math
that could be used to develop cold fusion.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.097
Dr. Grey had you kicked out of his class?

48:53.097 --> 48:54.265
No one gets in my way at this school.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.601
It's the word of America's
favorite science professor against...

48:56.601 --> 48:58.645
A lowly grad student.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.439
He stole your future.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.774
I am the Establishment.

49:02.774 --> 49:04.025
I want him bagged and gagged.

49:04.025 --> 49:05.151
Now we're talkin'.

49:05.902 --> 49:07.820
We have to get Grey
to take himself down.

49:11.574 --> 49:13.242
It's like a battle zone out here.

49:14.744 --> 49:16.371
- Security!
- I already have a lab coat.

49:16.371 --> 49:17.872
Oh, boy.
