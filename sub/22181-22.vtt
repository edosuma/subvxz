WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.654
Previously onSupergirl...

00:05.048 --> 00:06.049
Sam?

00:06.093 --> 00:07.616
Do you have some aspirin?

00:09.879 --> 00:13.187
If we don't begin
The Reach before
the beginning of my end,

00:13.230 --> 00:16.581
all of my Mars memories
will be lost forever.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.236
Selena is our high priestess.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.978
I call upon you, Worldkiller.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.416
Bring blessed
darkness to Earth,

00:25.460 --> 00:27.636
so that it may be reborn.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.680
Where's the ship?

00:28.724 --> 00:29.812
It's gone.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.514
Welcome, sisters.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.517
We three, together on Earth,

00:39.561 --> 00:41.693
just as the prophecy foretold.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.261
Did you doubt it?

00:44.305 --> 00:47.612
I only doubted that
I would live to see
this wondrous day.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.876
The Earth's yellow sun
will restore you, Vita.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.488
You will be stronger
than you ever dreamed.

00:53.531 --> 00:57.927
I can feel it,
the power coursing
through my veins.

01:01.322 --> 01:04.194
We have powers
beyond reason here.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.848
You must summon Reign.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.285
Let us begin.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.939
Give me the Harun-El.

01:17.816 --> 01:21.211
The Earth's atmosphere
has made the Harun-El
toxic to us.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.647
What will we do?

01:24.823 --> 01:27.652
Our faithful servant
will assist.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.655
The human.

01:30.699 --> 01:35.747
A human who bows down
to the Daughters of Juru.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.319
Prepare the ceremony.

01:48.847 --> 01:51.589
This is Selena's house.
There must be a back way in.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.684
Or a hidden way.

02:17.311 --> 02:20.836
It's an atlas
of the Earth.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.882
I've seen these
writings before

02:24.970 --> 02:26.494
in Coville's journal.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.931
They're instructions.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.411
Instructions for what?

02:30.454 --> 02:32.674
For making Worldkillers.

02:32.717 --> 02:36.547
Seems the Daughters of Juru
created Reign,
Purity, and Pestilence

02:36.591 --> 02:39.420
years ago on Krypton
and sent them to Earth.

02:40.116 --> 02:41.770
And now, they're following.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.685
We have to find a way
to let the DEO know

02:43.728 --> 02:45.252
that Selena's headed
back to Earth.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.863
Our protective dome
makes communication
impossible.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.083
There has to be
something here
that can help us.

02:55.610 --> 02:56.741
Mom?

03:02.269 --> 03:03.444
Mom.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.752
Hi, baby.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.235
What time is it?
Is it morning?

03:12.279 --> 03:14.019
Something's wrong.
You're sick.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.414
Please don't tell me
you're fine.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.590
Not again.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.420
You're right,
I don't...
I don't feel well.

03:24.856 --> 03:28.904
And you're also right,
I should've been
honest with you

03:28.947 --> 03:31.428
from the very beginning.
That was a mistake.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.605
But here's the truth.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.392
I don't know
what's going on with me.

03:38.435 --> 03:41.743
But we're gonna
call Lena and Alex,

03:41.786 --> 03:44.136
and they're gonna get
to the bottom of this, okay?

03:46.008 --> 03:47.618
-Okay.

03:47.662 --> 03:48.924
Hey...

03:48.967 --> 03:53.624
I love you more than anything
in this world.

03:55.191 --> 03:58.238
I promise you I will never
keep you in the dark again.

04:15.342 --> 04:19.259
Alex, I hope
we're not disturbing you.

04:19.302 --> 04:24.046
No. No, no, no.
There's always time
for my two favorite people.

04:24.089 --> 04:28.224
I came because I wished
to see you again, Alex.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.835
To say goodbye.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.231
It's time.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.671
You have brought me much joy

04:40.715 --> 04:44.196
in my time
on your Earth, Alex.

04:44.240 --> 04:49.637
You and your friends
showed me strange
and wonderful things.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.554
You know, you have
a rare gift

04:53.597 --> 04:56.034
for intuiting
the feelings of others.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.733
You would've made
an excellent Green Martian.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.565
Most of all,

05:04.608 --> 05:08.351
you have given me
the great gift

05:08.395 --> 05:11.180
of witnessing
your love for my son.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.967
Home is not a place,

05:16.011 --> 05:21.016
it is living among those
who love and honor you.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.715
I can depart
this world with peace

05:24.759 --> 05:28.240
because I know
my son is home.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.073
It has been a great honor

05:35.117 --> 05:37.337
getting to spend time
with you, Myr'nn.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.123
And now I know where J'onn

05:42.951 --> 05:44.953
gets his dignity

05:47.172 --> 05:49.087
and his enormous heart.

05:50.785 --> 05:54.310
There's no need for watering
of the eyes, child.

05:55.137 --> 05:58.183
All of life is change.

05:59.228 --> 06:04.015
Doing The Reach allows me
to live on forever,

06:05.321 --> 06:06.975
within my son.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.805
I am very, very fortunate.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.766
Time is slipping, J'onn.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.421
We must get
the Staff of Kh'ollar
and go.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.640
Yes, Father.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.164
J'onn.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.343
Is there anything I can do?

06:28.475 --> 06:30.215
I can come with you.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.392
This is something I have
to do on my own.

06:33.871 --> 06:36.787
But knowing that you're there
is help enough.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.922
You're in charge.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.061
Kara, do you recognize this?

06:53.108 --> 06:57.982
"Whoever wields this sword
shall bathe in the blood
of the old worlds,

06:58.026 --> 06:59.984
and reign with
might over the new."

07:00.028 --> 07:01.595
It's an ancient
religious text.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.467
According to lore,
the scabbard holds
the sword of Juru.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.688
It would appear
the sword is real,
and missing.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.691
Kara, look.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.997
-Yes.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.263
Hello, Alura.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.703
I'm sorry I couldn't
say goodbye.
I was in a rush.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.182
You may have left Argo,

07:24.226 --> 07:26.533
but you will never be able
to escape yourself, Selena.

07:26.576 --> 07:30.145
Your shame will follow you
on any planet.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.060
It is you who should
feel shame.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.932
You, who are responsible
for the death of Krypton,

07:34.976 --> 07:37.587
you who are unrepentant.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.546
I lost my home,
just as you did.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.548
I lost my husband.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.333
I thought you and I
had been rebuilding
our culture together.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.943
Our culture?

07:45.987 --> 07:48.424
For 20 years,
I've been biting my tongue,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.252
masquerading as one of you,

07:50.295 --> 07:54.517
while my culture has been
forced into the shadows,
deemed unworthy.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.214
Then why did you give us
the Harun

07:56.258 --> 07:59.435
My sisters and I
have waited patiently

07:59.479 --> 08:00.741
for the Worldkiller to rise

08:00.784 --> 08:03.874
and make the Earth
habitable for our people.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.746
It was supposed to
happen long ago,

08:05.789 --> 08:09.445
but the human
in Reign proved strong.

08:09.489 --> 08:14.319
Reign and Samantha Arias
had to be separated.

08:14.363 --> 08:18.454
I was going to do it myself,
but you saved me the trouble.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.981
Only one of them
will survive the split.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.723
How quaint that you thought
it should be the human.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.944
Sam is alive and
Reign is dead.
I saw it happen.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.686
You're naive,
just like your mother

08:32.729 --> 08:34.862
if you thought that
is what happened.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.690
And you're naive if you think
the people of Earth

08:36.733 --> 08:38.126
won't find a way
to stop Reign.

08:38.169 --> 08:41.303
It's not Reign
who will need
to be stopped,

08:41.346 --> 08:42.696
it's Earth herself.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.132
What do you mean?

08:44.175 --> 08:47.570
Reign is the spark
that ignites the eruptions.

08:47.614 --> 08:51.835
Seismic catastrophes
that would
wipe out all humans

08:51.879 --> 08:53.968
and terraform the Earth.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.579
It's almost a pity, really,

08:56.623 --> 08:58.799
-that you won't
be around to see it.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.931
We have to
get out of here.
It's a trap!

09:04.674 --> 09:06.807
Kara!

09:06.850 --> 09:08.199
We need to get her help.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.988
I was better, Alex.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.381
I was me.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.341
Now I feel like I can barely
hold my head up.

09:19.384 --> 09:22.213
What about the blackouts?
Are you still losing any time?

09:24.259 --> 09:26.566
I just feel like my insides
are wilting away.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.267
Sam, your blood cells
have mutated.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.791
Before, they presented
as human.

09:34.835 --> 09:38.360
But now, they are transforming
back into their natural state,

09:38.403 --> 09:39.361
which is Kryptonian.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.581
Like Supergirl?
Isn't that good?

09:41.624 --> 09:43.147
No, I don't feel stronger.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.193
I've never felt weaker.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.891
That's because
your blood cells
are oxygen-deprived.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.328
They're shrinking.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.548
In fact, they look like
they're becoming dormant.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.379
We need to fix this.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.426
I have not fought
this hard to lose now.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.558
-We will.
-We will.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.081
If she's Kryptonian
like Supergirl,

10:04.125 --> 10:05.735
can't you fix her
with the sun?

10:05.779 --> 10:07.171
Yellow sun lamps.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.391
She's right.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.132
The sun lamps
should heal you.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.960
We're gonna supercharge you.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.230
Yo, Demos, punch me.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.147
You heard me. Punch me.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.629
Finally.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.847
Seriously?
You're not even gonna ask--

10:33.807 --> 10:35.025
Eh?

10:35.809 --> 10:37.637
Huh

10:37.680 --> 10:40.204
You know,
that wasn't as satisfying
as I'd imagined.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.641
And I've imagined it.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.252
What happened?

10:44.295 --> 10:48.299
An omnidirectional,
self-maintaining,
sub-atomic personal shield.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.126
Boom.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.260
Cool. How does it work?

10:52.303 --> 10:54.349
Oh. You know what,
here. Check it.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.095
That literally looks
like nothing.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.705
Dude, it's a frequency
conversion--

11:02.749 --> 11:05.142
You know what,
don't worry about it.
It's all good.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.970
Point is, I invented it,

11:07.014 --> 11:08.798
and it's like
the cornerstone

11:08.842 --> 11:11.105
of all the non-lethal tech
that I'm creating for J'onn.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.978
Oh, it's like
a magnet for atoms.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.284
You're a genius.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.549
Change the world,
that's what I do.
Oh!

11:20.984 --> 11:22.203
Check it.

11:22.246 --> 11:25.467
You know what,
this is top secret research.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.352
I am ready, my son.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.183
There's so much
I wanna say to you.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.317
But I'm afraid
that once we start,

11:49.360 --> 11:51.275
I won't get a chance
to finish it all.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.321
No.

11:53.364 --> 11:57.673
Our thoughts, our words
will flow freely

11:57.717 --> 11:59.370
as we begin The Reach.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.816
My mind is free again.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.034
Shall we kneel?

12:11.078 --> 12:12.340
Yes.

12:23.481 --> 12:27.442
The process will begin
with my most recent memories,

12:27.485 --> 12:29.879
and travel back
through my life,

12:29.923 --> 12:32.969
and then the lives
of all those
I am connected to.

12:33.013 --> 12:36.538
It will be painful at times

12:36.581 --> 12:40.585
as we venture back
through my imprisonment.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.284
But we will break
through those barriers,

12:43.327 --> 12:47.810
and you will touch
the parchment
of the sacred scrolls,

12:47.854 --> 12:50.813
breathe the air on Mars,

12:50.857 --> 12:53.207
moments after its creation.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.340
I am ready to face it all.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.649
I never imagined
that my memories,

13:00.692 --> 13:04.827
the history of our people
and our religion,

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
would live on when I passed.

13:08.004 --> 13:12.704
And now, all of
it will in you.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.494
Let us begin.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.987
Selena couldn't have known
I was going to come back

13:34.030 --> 13:35.684
after she gave me
the Harun-El.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.992
She had to have another plan
to get to Earth.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.515
Are there any other
ships on Argo?

13:40.558 --> 13:43.518
No, they were all destroyed,
and we've rebuilt nothing.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.521
What about the Legion?
Can you call them
with the beacon?

13:46.564 --> 13:49.567
Unfortunately, the beacon
didn't survive the explosion.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.267
All your father
wanted to do
was save us all.

13:53.310 --> 13:56.444
He built this dome.
He saved Argo.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.706
He was looking
for another way,

13:57.749 --> 13:59.882
but he never got it
completed in time.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.928
Maybe that's what Selena
was planning on using.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.713
She knew it existed,
she had years
to get it working.

14:04.756 --> 14:05.757
Get what working?

14:05.801 --> 14:07.368
The transmat portal.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.065
Your father had
been developing it

14:09.109 --> 14:11.328
to get every Kryptonian
off the planet
before it exploded.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.373
But he failed.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.635
Where's the portal now?

14:20.642 --> 14:21.861
Father's lab.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.345
I can't believe
it's still here.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.958
I spent so many afternoons
with him here,

14:32.001 --> 14:33.307
watching him work.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.050
Sometimes, when he was
working on a problem,

14:37.093 --> 14:39.617
he'd use me
as a sounding board.

14:39.661 --> 14:43.491
He talked to me
like I was another scientist.

14:43.534 --> 14:46.711
He'd make me feel
the most important person
that ever existed.

14:49.976 --> 14:54.371
The stage is set
for the ceremony
to bring forth Reign.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.640
Hold the Harun-El
perfectly still

15:02.684 --> 15:04.686
when the transformation
begins.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.651
May my suffering
appease the dark gods

15:13.695 --> 15:16.611
and grant us our salvation.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.887
Spirits unite

15:31.931 --> 15:36.892
as we ask
the one true goddess
of Old Krypton,

15:37.197 --> 15:38.589
Yuda Kal,

15:39.416 --> 15:42.028
to bring us our Goddess,

15:42.942 --> 15:46.075
to bring us our salvation,

15:47.381 --> 15:50.514
to bring us Reign.

15:52.603 --> 15:53.648
Ahh!

15:59.915 --> 16:02.309
She is born again.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.016
Something's wrong.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.281
She is unformed.

16:18.325 --> 16:21.154
She only has
one bloodline, Reign's.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.720
There should be three.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.809
She needs to
embody the Trinity.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.597
Purity and Pestilence
may be dead,

16:30.772 --> 16:32.861
but their blood still exists.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.951
I can sense it.

16:37.300 --> 16:41.435
We need to find the blood
of Reign's sisters
to make her whole.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.741
I know where you can find it.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.486
We're nearly done, okay?
You're doing great.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.272
You look better already.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.100
You're such a bad liar,

16:54.143 --> 16:55.971
but I am grateful for that.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.018
Okay, Sam, I need you to count
to three, and then look at us.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.109
One, two, three.

17:09.854 --> 17:13.032
Yes, you're waving.
Is that supposed to
mean something?

17:15.121 --> 17:16.383
What?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.080
What's going on?

17:18.124 --> 17:21.866
It's a refractive
scatterfield.
It's basically an eye test.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.652
If your cells were expressing
in a Kryptonian manner,

17:24.695 --> 17:26.262
then you wouldn't
have been able
to see us.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.048
Your eyes would've
hurt just trying
to even look through.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.051
So the sun lamps
aren't working?

17:32.094 --> 17:33.530
Okay, so what's next?

17:33.574 --> 17:35.619
Environmental factors
can influence gene expression,

17:35.663 --> 17:37.621
turning it on and off.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.624
Maybe this Harun-El
can rewrite the process.

17:40.668 --> 17:42.670
I could take this blood
back to the lab

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
and see if the Harun-El
will rejuvenate your cells.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.901
We're gonna figure this out.
I promise, okay?

17:57.641 --> 17:58.860
Stay strong.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.867
The portal doesn't
look so bad.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.043
Selena and her witches
had it mostly working.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.697
Even if we get it
up and running,

18:09.740 --> 18:12.178
we'd need another portal
to transport to.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.875
They have one in the DEO.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.703
We just have
no way to contact them.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.313
Are there any crystals here?

18:17.357 --> 18:20.751
I mean, maybe we can
contact them
the way we did Selena.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.493
All he had are these.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.235
Kryptonian cache crystals,
like the ones
I put in your pod.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.585
I've seen those in the DEO.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.155
Alert. AI room engaged.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.374
Whoa, whoa.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.767
That... that's weird.

18:44.862 --> 18:45.994
Okay.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.389
Oh, God, no. No!

18:49.432 --> 18:50.912
Oh, you're creepy.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.132
AI malfunction.
Okay. Be gone.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.831
Whoa!
Will you stop,
please?

18:56.874 --> 18:58.137
You're fully wigging me out.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.705
Winn, Winn, it's Kara.
I need your help.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.840
Okay, not only are you now
appearing at will,

19:05.883 --> 19:08.408
you are fully schizophrenic.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.105
Winn, Winn, listen to me.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.543
I am using cache crystals
on Argo City to reach you.

19:13.587 --> 19:17.243
It is the only way we have
of communicating
from under the dome.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.462
I know I sound like Alura,

19:19.506 --> 19:20.985
but it's Kara.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.640
My mom and Mon-El are with me.
We're stranded on Argo.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.729
Sam's in trouble,

19:25.773 --> 19:27.383
and we believe that Reign
is still alive.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.693
Alex!

19:33.346 --> 19:34.869
Kara, is that really you?

19:34.912 --> 19:35.783
Yes.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.437
Alex, this is an emergency.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.831
No, I feel like
we need to give her
a test or something.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.443
Like something
only Kara would know.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.358
What was the name
of your first pet?

19:45.401 --> 19:46.533
-Streaky.
-No, no.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.230
That's too easy.
Everybody knows that.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.798
-Alex.
-Winn, shut up.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.843
Okay, tell me
what's going on.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.672
Dark Kryptonians
stole our ship
and flew to Earth.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.501
It turns out the Harun-El
we used to kill Reign

19:58.545 --> 20:00.068
and save Sam split them apart.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.723
But Reign is
only dormant,
not gone.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.725
The Dark Kryptonian witches
want to resurrect her

20:04.768 --> 20:06.857
and use her to
terraform the Earth,

20:06.901 --> 20:08.946
turning it into
a new Krypton.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.688
Okay, tell me you have a plan.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.342
Mon-El and I need
to get back to Earth.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.258
Father has a transmat portal,
but we need to make it work.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.042
Transmat portal?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.393
Okay, I can help you
set yours up,

20:20.436 --> 20:21.524
then we will
get ours working,

20:21.568 --> 20:23.309
and then we can
interface them, yes.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.832
And you are Kara, right?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.007
-Yes.
-Yes.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.530
I knew that.
I knew that.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.585
How does it feel, my son,

20:38.628 --> 20:42.066
to now know
all of the 500 million moves

20:42.110 --> 20:43.894
on the Ok'Rock'Tock board?

20:43.938 --> 20:45.983
Enlightened, Father.

20:46.027 --> 20:49.073
Just don't share them
with your imaginary
friend, Zook.

20:49.117 --> 20:52.947
-Zook, Zook! It was Zook.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.430
What are these
empty rooms for?

20:57.473 --> 21:00.259
We could
make this our home.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.570
These are happy memories.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.268
They should make you happy.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.358
And they do, Father.

21:14.621 --> 21:18.146
But they also
remind me how much
I'm going to miss you.

21:19.626 --> 21:21.584
Every moment
that passes between us

21:21.628 --> 21:24.413
brings us closer
to that eventuality.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.415
By the end of this,

21:26.459 --> 21:30.201
you will not feel loss, J'onn.

21:30.245 --> 21:33.030
You will feel complete.
I promise.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.729
How do you know?

21:35.772 --> 21:39.863
Because I know
the hole that comes
with not doing this,

21:40.995 --> 21:44.825
the way I felt
when your mother
was taken from me,

21:44.868 --> 21:47.001
when you were taken from me.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.396
Be patient, my son.

21:51.571 --> 21:57.316
Let the memories fill you up
as they have filled me up.

22:05.498 --> 22:06.890
Okay.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.676
So we should really be able
to talk now.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.721
I just need a few minutes
to route the power

22:11.765 --> 22:13.636
from Argo's main grid.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.726
Okay. Do you see
a multi-phase descrambler
which links to a power source?

22:16.770 --> 22:21.992
Uh, yeah, but the insulator
is cracked.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.429
Which means as soon as we go
through the portal,

22:23.472 --> 22:26.345
the circuits will fry,
which makes it a one-way trip.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.347
Oh, hey, I mean,
at least you don't
really have any

22:28.390 --> 22:29.957
need to go back
to Argo City.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.175
In fact, I'm surprised
that you're still there.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.829
I thought you were
gonna call the Legion

22:32.873 --> 22:34.309
and go straight
back to the future.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.658
Uh...

22:35.702 --> 22:37.660
Yeah, yeah, I was.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.619
But then,
the time beacon broke,

22:40.620 --> 22:41.664
and Kara ran into
some trouble,

22:41.708 --> 22:44.537
so I decided
to stay back to...

22:44.580 --> 22:46.887
Mmm-hmm. Always the hero.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.149
Yeah.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.328
I lost her once, Winn.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.027
I'm not sure
I can do it again.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.684
Wow. Really? Dude.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.294
Dude, forget Reign.

23:03.338 --> 23:06.123
You need to get
back here fast,
so we can get a drink.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.474
He's a good man.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.563
Yeah, yeah, he is.

23:10.606 --> 23:13.000
The connection
between you two
is obvious.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.089
He makes you happy.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.657
Do you love him?

23:17.700 --> 23:22.357
No, mom, that's not
an easy question
to answer.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.620
Why not?

23:24.664 --> 23:27.231
There's a history between us.

23:27.928 --> 23:29.320
And complications.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.932
When this crisis is over,

23:31.975 --> 23:33.020
I hope that
we will find time

23:33.063 --> 23:34.978
for you to tell me
all about it.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.024
I'd like that.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.767
It worked.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.595
Portal's on.
Now just fire it up
and bring us home.

23:42.638 --> 23:43.987
All right.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.164
Winn?

23:50.690 --> 23:51.952
Winn, what happened?

23:51.995 --> 23:54.302
We got this.
Come on.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.391
You guys, I think
the Dark Kryptonians are here.

24:34.516 --> 24:38.346
We were drawn by the blood
of our fallen Worldkillers.

24:38.389 --> 24:41.436
Hand it over,
and we won't spill yours.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.264
Get the blood.
It's in the lab.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.222
-Destroy it.
-You got it.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.486
Didn't they teach you
how to knock on Krypton?

25:03.937 --> 25:06.374
Find the blood
of our sisters.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.691
Hello

25:19.822 --> 25:21.302
Mon

25:21.345 --> 25:23.739
It's Kara's mother.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.524
Listen, listen,
we have three Kryptonians
that have just attacked us.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.831
We really need your daughter
to come back like ASAP.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.620
Winn?

25:38.188 --> 25:40.321
-Hi, there.

25:43.890 --> 25:44.891
A-ha!

25:51.332 --> 25:53.203
Your friend was back,
but now he's gone.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.168
-We need to know
what's going on there.
-Let me try.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.525
This is the hologram's
point of view.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.527
Okay, now we know
what's going on.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.573
Can you get their
portal online?

26:14.616 --> 26:15.835
I'm trying.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.495
That's not good.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.856
Vita.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.249
Alura.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.731
How did you survive?

26:42.775 --> 26:44.428
I'm faster than I look.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.432
She took the bait.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.263
Mom, we have to go.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.963
I'll be too slow.
You go, baby, you go.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.181
I'm not leaving without you.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.487
I'll distract her.
You go.

27:04.797 --> 27:05.928
Come here.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.305
You can't escape me for long.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.793
I see you found the blood
of our sisters.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.627
Yeah, Kryptonite bullets.

28:11.777 --> 28:12.995
Demos, run!

28:42.459 --> 28:44.157
I'm surprised
Selena kept you.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.636
You were never very smart.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.161
What did you say?

28:48.204 --> 28:51.033
You were never very smart.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.043
I'm through.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.479
I'm coming with you.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.572
Welcome to Earth.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.063
He has the blood.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.720
Demos, your belt!

29:49.309 --> 29:50.571
No!

29:52.007 --> 29:53.139
No!

29:56.795 --> 30:00.102
She actually cares
for these humans.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.930
One would have thought
that "The Girl of Steel"

30:01.974 --> 30:04.890
would know that caring
makes you weak.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.153
Give me the blood.

30:07.196 --> 30:08.545
You want the blood?

30:10.852 --> 30:12.158
You can have it.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.334
I'm so sorry, Alex.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.596
You just keep
monitoring Sam,

30:59.640 --> 31:01.076
and I'll keep you
posted on my end.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.557
Okay. Bye.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.386
More bad news?

31:06.429 --> 31:08.431
Yeah. Sam's no better.

31:08.475 --> 31:10.477
And there are three people
in National City

31:10.520 --> 31:11.608
with the same
powers as Supergirl

31:11.652 --> 31:12.783
that just murdered somebody.

31:12.827 --> 31:15.177
Oh, that is not good.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.962
And my news is no better.

31:17.005 --> 31:18.702
I reworked the Harun-El
to try and jump-start
Sam's blood cells

31:18.746 --> 31:20.182
like you asked,

31:20.226 --> 31:23.359
but they're not responding.
They're getting weaker.

31:23.403 --> 31:26.449
Maybe I can adjust the ratio
of the solution we used

31:26.493 --> 31:29.017
and re-inject Sam.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.759
This should still
have the blood
of Reign and Sam on it.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.903
I think I know
what's wrong with Sam.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.779
This is...

31:52.823 --> 31:55.609
This is like
reliving this horror.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.134
Perhaps we should take
a break, Father.

31:59.178 --> 32:03.443
No. The hardships we travailed
are important.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.140
As we reach through them,

32:05.184 --> 32:08.100
you will learn the lessons
I have learned.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.625
Be able to teach others
to take a different path.

32:12.626 --> 32:17.413
And when we reach
past the painful memories,

32:17.457 --> 32:20.939
inevitably, we find the good.

32:24.246 --> 32:28.685
Before the fires,
there was your birth.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.297
A gift from H'ronmeer

32:31.340 --> 32:36.389
who forced me
to lift my head up
out of the scriptures,

32:36.432 --> 32:38.173
and to have a life.

32:39.522 --> 32:43.787
Since I have been here,
I have tried to
teach you balance.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.834
I pray that now,

32:46.877 --> 32:51.012
as we journey together,
entwining our consciousness,

32:52.709 --> 32:56.887
you will truly understand.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.461
What happened?

33:05.505 --> 33:07.159
We lost the blood.

33:07.202 --> 33:10.901
Don't worry, sisters.
The blood is not lost.

33:11.946 --> 33:14.166
It is right here with us.

33:31.531 --> 33:34.708
If they're regular
Kryptonians, we should be able
to track them down.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.405
They're protected by magic.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.625
I will find them.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.540
Do you think
we should call J'onn?

33:40.583 --> 33:42.324
No, he's with Myr'nn.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.761
I'll get him
if the situation
becomes dire.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.154
Imagine if we had
Reign to deal with.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.113
Unfortunately,
I think we do.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.766
Sam, you should
be in bed.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.899
I need to be here.
This involves me.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.293
I know why Sam's sick.

33:54.336 --> 33:57.209
These are Sam's blood cells,
and these are Reign's.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.645
Sam's blood cells
are getting weaker,

33:58.688 --> 34:00.951
while Reign's
are getting stronger.

34:00.995 --> 34:05.086
They share a symbiotic,
non-local entanglement.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.349
Reign and Sam
are still connected.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.308
Reign's back and
she's getting stronger
by the minute.

34:09.351 --> 34:12.093
But I destroyed
the Worldkiller's blood.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.835
Demos gave his life
to stop them.

34:14.878 --> 34:17.707
I don't know how,
but they have it.

34:17.751 --> 34:21.189
If Reign is getting stronger,
then couldn't
the opposite be true?

34:21.233 --> 34:23.539
If Sam gets stronger,
then Reign would get weaker.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.845
My thoughts exactly.

34:24.888 --> 34:27.500
But how?
Nothing we've tried
has worked.

34:27.543 --> 34:29.241
The Fountains of Lillith.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.720
Fountains of what?

34:30.764 --> 34:33.027
Years ago, when I sentenced
Jindah Kol Rozz to prison,

34:33.071 --> 34:35.247
she spouted about vengeance.

34:35.290 --> 34:39.860
One fountain gave
infinite strength.
The other brought weakness.

34:39.903 --> 34:41.644
She spoke of a woman
born of the fountain

34:41.688 --> 34:43.603
with the power of destruction.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.605
Reign was created
in the Dark Valley,

34:45.648 --> 34:47.607
and she doesn't
get her powers
from the yellow sun.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.348
Maybe she got them
from this fountain.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.219
Then it's settled.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.439
I'm going back
to the Dark Valley.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.918
Sam, you're too weak.

34:54.962 --> 34:57.312
We don't have Brainy
to get you there.

34:57.356 --> 34:58.487
Lena was able to do it.

34:58.531 --> 34:59.836
That was using
electric shock.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.838
And in your current condition,
Alex is right.

35:01.882 --> 35:03.013
I don't know
if you'd survive.

35:03.057 --> 35:04.319
That's a risk
I'm willing to take

35:04.363 --> 35:06.278
if it means ending Reign
and saving the world.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.150
And I have to do it
for my daughter.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.893
I promise you,
I am not dying today.

35:47.406 --> 35:48.885
You're real.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.365
Of course, I'm real.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.021
I made you.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.986
With the Sword of Juru,

36:03.552 --> 36:05.337
we plant these seeds

36:05.380 --> 36:08.688
that transform this planet
into New Krypton.

36:19.786 --> 36:21.962
We have no need
of the human anymore.

36:25.966 --> 36:29.230
But I have killed
people for you.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.146
My followers have prayed
against your enemies.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.193
I bowed down to you.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.717
You promised.
You said that
you were righteous.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.372
And she is, for us.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.374
Not for you.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.420
Hypocrite.

36:45.464 --> 36:46.552
Weak.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.162
Nothing.

37:03.482 --> 37:04.570
How you doing, man?

37:05.005 --> 37:06.441
He trusted me.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.315
And I killed him.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.145
Kara told me
that Demos got hit

37:15.189 --> 37:17.278
by three heat-vision
blasts at once.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.193
Nobody could have
predicted that.

37:19.237 --> 37:24.111
You know,
for just a second,
you really had me believing

37:24.154 --> 37:25.504
that I could
change the world.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.549
Winn, just stop, okay?

37:27.593 --> 37:29.899
A lot of people
would have died today

37:29.943 --> 37:31.727
if it wasn't
for your technology.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.382
I mean I would've died
a hundred times over
if it wasn't for you.

37:35.731 --> 37:38.604
Alex said that you were
gonna go see the Mayor?

37:38.647 --> 37:42.347
Get CatCo to put out the word
that the city needs
to stay safe.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.740
Yeah, but I came to see
about you first.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.353
Okay, well, you should
get back to CatCo.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.270
They're gonna...
They're gonna need you.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.762
Your friend Sam is strong.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.286
She's fighting
for her daughter,

38:08.721 --> 38:09.852
like you.

38:10.679 --> 38:13.813
Mom, this is Alex.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.598
-Oh!
-I...

38:19.297 --> 38:21.777
You and your family
rescued my daughter.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.214
I am indebted to you.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.913
Sometimes, I think
she's the one
that rescued us.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.262
Sam's ready.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.749
Ruby, I really think
that you need to wait outside.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.751
No, I'm staying.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.970
Listen to me, baby.

38:41.014 --> 38:42.885
This is gonna hurt.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.670
It's gonna look scary.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.281
But your mom is a badass.

38:48.151 --> 38:49.936
She can handle it, okay?

38:49.979 --> 38:51.372
You are a badass.

38:53.896 --> 38:54.897
I'm ready.

39:10.826 --> 39:13.742
Run, Samantha.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.876
Run, Samantha.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.361
We're coming for you.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.192
Let us begin.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.418
[witches chanting
in Kryptonian]

39:47.515 --> 39:49.212
I've got her.
You go save the city.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.431
-Let's go.
-Stay with Lena.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.397
This planet is
no longer stable.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.399
I can hear the screams.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.618
This world needs us.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.234
It's starting.

40:19.068 --> 40:20.505
8.0 earthquake,

40:20.548 --> 40:23.725
tornadoes and super storms
over Madagascar?

40:23.769 --> 40:25.423
Tsunami warning?

40:25.466 --> 40:28.034
We got 100% chance of,
you guessed it, Reign.

40:28.077 --> 40:29.601
It's the terraforming.

40:29.644 --> 40:32.342
On Zune, they terraformed
her planet's
natural resources,

40:32.386 --> 40:33.953
so they'd go right
through the planet's core

40:33.996 --> 40:35.302
to create a genesis event.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.478
Destroy all life
in order to be reborn.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.306
Exactly.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.786
Go through the Earth's core,
and you get pretty close
to Madagascar.

40:40.829 --> 40:43.092
Okay, so that's clearly
what the witches are doing.

40:43.136 --> 40:46.966
Can I ask how long
it took this genesis
event to be completed?

40:47.009 --> 40:48.097
Hours.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.751
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

40:51.623 --> 40:52.493
The memories?

40:52.537 --> 40:53.755
This was too important.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.453
Supergirl, Mon-El,
damage control.

40:55.496 --> 40:57.280
Alex, get every agent we have.

40:57.324 --> 40:58.717
Boots on the ground,
evacuating.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.023
Winn, I want you to monitor
everything from here.

41:01.067 --> 41:03.373
I'm gonna find out where
this is coming from
and stop it.

41:03.417 --> 41:04.636
Wait.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.640
Take me to the nexus point.

41:08.683 --> 41:12.382
If I shapeshift
into the Earth,
bond with it,

41:13.035 --> 41:14.210
I can stop this.

41:14.254 --> 41:15.473
It'd rip you apart.

41:15.516 --> 41:18.127
This planet is my son's home.

41:18.171 --> 41:19.825
I intend to save it with him.
