WEBVTT

00:00.965 --> 00:03.583
Okay, squad,
the funeral's at 3:00,

00:03.584 --> 00:05.752
followed by a reception
at Shaw's Bar.

00:05.753 --> 00:07.919
I want you all
on your best behavior.

00:07.955 --> 00:09.155
Yeah, and all eyes
are gonna be on us

00:09.156 --> 00:10.922
because Frick and Frack here
killed Captain Dozerman.

00:10.958 --> 00:12.992
Hey, we accidentally
startled a man

00:12.993 --> 00:14.761
with a genetic heart condition.

00:14.762 --> 00:16.842
If you really think about it,
his parents killed him.

00:16.864 --> 00:18.031
All right, whatever.

00:18.032 --> 00:19.532
Look, there's a horse race
going off in Dubai.

00:19.533 --> 00:21.067
I got serious money on it.

00:21.068 --> 00:22.735
Dismissed.

00:22.736 --> 00:25.771
Oh, yeah, we should all
check out that race.

00:25.806 --> 00:27.140
God.

00:27.141 --> 00:29.242
He is the worst captain
we've ever had.

00:29.243 --> 00:31.244
He drew boobies
on my bulletproof vest.

00:31.245 --> 00:33.813
He stared at me for 90 seconds
while he ate an entire peach.

00:33.814 --> 00:34.881
He heard that I speak Spanish,

00:34.882 --> 00:36.582
and he made me fire
his housekeeper.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.583
She was Polish.

00:37.584 --> 00:38.751
At least he doesn't practice

00:38.752 --> 00:39.752
his crane kicks with you.

00:42.489 --> 00:43.723
[both grunt]

00:43.724 --> 00:45.091
I said not to move!

00:45.092 --> 00:46.092
I didn't move.

00:46.093 --> 00:47.093
Listen, guys.

00:47.094 --> 00:48.294
Jake and I were talking
last night.

00:48.295 --> 00:49.796
Pillow talk alert!
Set the scene.

00:49.797 --> 00:51.397
- Spooning or face-to-face?
- Charles.

00:51.398 --> 00:52.632
[whispering] Spooning.

00:52.633 --> 00:54.267
Anyway, we came up with a plan.

00:54.268 --> 00:57.303
Jake is going to befriend
the Vulture

00:57.304 --> 00:58.738
<i>so he lays off of us.</i>

00:58.739 --> 00:59.739
<i>It's true.</i>

00:59.740 --> 01:00.807
I'm gonna bro down with him.

01:00.808 --> 01:01.974
If everything goes
according to plan,

01:01.975 --> 01:03.142
we should be beer pong
doubles partners

01:03.143 --> 01:04.444
by the end of the week.

01:04.444 --> 01:06.779
Now somebody get me
a puka shell necklace.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.680
I'm going full douche.

'Sup, Jake?

01:35.242 --> 01:36.342
<i>Got a little update for you</i>

01:36.343 --> 01:38.277
on that Deberg assault case.

01:38.278 --> 01:41.747
Turns out the victim's wife
was super hot.

01:41.748 --> 01:43.749
Yeah, I read the file.
She's a mom.

01:43.750 --> 01:44.884
Not interested.

01:44.885 --> 01:46.552
True that.

01:46.553 --> 01:49.355
So listen, I've been thinking.

01:49.356 --> 01:51.390
We got off
on the wrong foot here.

01:51.391 --> 01:53.359
And I believe it's 'cause
we're just

01:53.360 --> 01:54.660
too damn similar.

01:54.661 --> 01:55.927
- You do?
-<i> Absolutely.</i>

01:55.963 --> 01:57.697
We both love premium tequila...

01:57.698 --> 01:58.698
Yeah.

01:58.699 --> 02:00.199
- Robin Thicke.
- Oh, yeah.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.901
- Gots to have my puks.
- Gots to.

02:01.902 --> 02:04.303
And of course,
most importantly: Nip slips.

02:04.304 --> 02:06.139
<i>[chuckles] Let me ask
you a question, Jake.</i>

02:06.140 --> 02:07.940
You also like
Okinawan martial arts?

02:07.941 --> 02:10.241
Because you left this
in my back.

02:10.276 --> 02:11.277
Hmm?

02:11.278 --> 02:12.545
What I'm saying, Einstein,

02:12.546 --> 02:14.446
is that you stabbed me
in my back.

02:14.481 --> 02:15.781
How so?

02:15.782 --> 02:17.016
<i>We came up with a plan.</i>

02:19.753 --> 02:21.845
Busted.
I knew that you were faking it.

02:21.855 --> 02:23.622
I'll bet you don't even
like nip slips!

02:23.657 --> 02:25.224
So, what, you bugged
the briefing room?

02:25.225 --> 02:27.093
No, Scully butt-dialed me
yesterday

02:27.094 --> 02:28.361
and he still hasn't hung up.

02:28.362 --> 02:30.062
Once again, Scully's butt
is the downfall

02:30.063 --> 02:31.096
of this precinct.

02:31.131 --> 02:32.832
Look, Jake, I know
that you and Santiago

02:32.833 --> 02:34.033
are trying to take me down.

02:34.034 --> 02:36.502
You guys go home.
You lay in bed together.

02:36.503 --> 02:37.770
You plot against me.

02:37.771 --> 02:39.338
Well, no longer.

02:39.339 --> 02:41.606
I want you to dump Santiago,
and that's an order.

02:41.642 --> 02:43.109
What?
You can't do that.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.744
It's completely against
the rules.

02:44.745 --> 02:46.212
Okay, Sonia Sotomayor.

02:46.213 --> 02:47.680
I would never break the rules.

02:47.681 --> 02:49.615
But what I could do, for totally

02:49.616 --> 02:52.385
"unrelated reasons,"
is have you busted

02:52.386 --> 02:53.952
back down to a beat cop.

02:53.987 --> 02:56.255
No, don't do that, all right?

02:56.256 --> 02:57.723
I can learn to love nip slips.

02:57.724 --> 02:59.491
No, you either love them,
or you don't.

02:59.526 --> 03:00.593
It's too late.

03:00.594 --> 03:02.028
You dump Santiago, or you kiss

03:02.029 --> 03:03.328
that detective badge good-bye.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.199
Beat it.

03:08.202 --> 03:09.769
First time back
in the Nine-Nine.

03:09.770 --> 03:10.769
Mm.

03:10.804 --> 03:12.138
I really miss these people,

03:12.139 --> 03:15.341
the whole crew...
Jake, Terry, bleh.

03:15.342 --> 03:17.243
I forget all the other names.

03:17.244 --> 03:19.930
Just remember,
we're here as PR representatives.

03:19.931 --> 03:21.013
I don't wanna be.

03:21.014 --> 03:22.114
Too bad.

03:22.115 --> 03:23.416
We're like rock stars
to these people.

03:23.417 --> 03:24.750
They're gonna go nuts,
just like...

03:24.751 --> 03:27.119
[hushed yelling]

03:27.120 --> 03:28.421
I would hate it
if these doors opened

03:28.422 --> 03:30.488
and everyone stopped working
to applaud us.

03:34.928 --> 03:37.195
Hmm, nothing.

03:37.231 --> 03:39.932
You must be loving this.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.467
Yes.

03:41.468 --> 03:42.468
What?

03:42.469 --> 03:43.703
He's ordering us to break up?

03:43.704 --> 03:44.870
Look, we can deal with this.

03:44.871 --> 03:45.972
We just need a new plan.

03:45.973 --> 03:46.973
I got it.

03:46.974 --> 03:48.140
We lie, tell him we broke up,

03:48.141 --> 03:49.408
and then date in secret.

03:49.409 --> 03:52.311
Great! And you'd be okay
lying to your captain?

03:52.312 --> 03:53.846
- Okay, new plan.
- Uh-huh.

03:53.847 --> 03:55.513
[gasps] Captain Holt
is here today.

03:55.549 --> 03:56.649
Yes, genius!

03:56.650 --> 03:57.917
He loves us,

03:57.918 --> 03:59.318
and he's got tons of sway
in the department.

03:59.319 --> 04:00.553
He'll tell the Vulture
to back down.

04:00.554 --> 04:01.787
Yeah, he'll be all...

04:01.788 --> 04:03.923
[with deep voice]
"Vulture, I must insist

04:03.924 --> 04:05.992
that you desist."

04:05.993 --> 04:07.560
I really think
this is gonna work.

04:07.561 --> 04:09.362
Also, if you ever want
to bust out

04:09.363 --> 04:10.997
that Holt impression at home,

04:10.998 --> 04:12.431
I'd be okay with that.

04:12.432 --> 04:14.233
Oh, okay.

04:14.234 --> 04:15.935
Duly noted, super disturbing,

04:15.936 --> 04:17.402
but I'm definitely gonna do it.

04:18.805 --> 04:20.106
Hey, G-spot!

04:20.107 --> 04:23.074
Rosa, Charles, oh,
I missed you guys so much.

04:23.110 --> 04:24.844
Really, 'cause when you left,
you made a pretty big deal

04:24.845 --> 04:26.145
of deleting us from your phone.

04:26.146 --> 04:28.346
Girl, that was just
the showman in me.

04:28.382 --> 04:29.815
<i>PR is so boring.</i>

04:29.816 --> 04:32.183
I need some Nine-Nine drama,
stat.

04:32.219 --> 04:33.386
I don't think
we're that dramatic.

04:33.387 --> 04:34.754
I've been gone one week.

04:34.755 --> 04:36.856
Jake and Amy are dating,
and they've killed a person.

04:36.857 --> 04:38.323
<i>Come on, Charles.</i>

04:38.358 --> 04:40.592
You got to have something
weird and tragic going on.

04:40.627 --> 04:41.794
Nope.

04:41.795 --> 04:43.029
Not unless you call
hooking up with a girl

04:43.030 --> 04:44.096
at a funeral "weird and tragic."

04:44.097 --> 04:45.530
Home run!

04:45.565 --> 04:46.766
Her name is Lieutenant Singh.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.034
She's super hot.

04:48.035 --> 04:50.136
We were seated next
to each other two funerals ago.

04:50.137 --> 04:53.038
And there was hard eye contact
all through "Danny Boy."

04:53.073 --> 04:55.474
Last funeral, we made out
in the parking lot.

04:55.475 --> 04:56.842
This time...

04:56.843 --> 04:58.744
[with British accent] Something
naughty this way comes.

04:58.745 --> 05:00.913
Ugh. What do you even know
about this person?

05:00.914 --> 05:02.415
Oh, we don't know
anything about each other.

05:02.416 --> 05:03.916
She says she likes
that about us.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.652
It's just pure
animal attraction.

05:06.653 --> 05:08.721
This is creepy and unlike you.

05:08.722 --> 05:09.889
You even know her first name?

05:09.890 --> 05:12.224
Oh, um, do animals in the wild

05:12.225 --> 05:13.793
know each other's names?

05:13.794 --> 05:15.995
Look, all I know is,
Charles Boyle

05:15.996 --> 05:17.129
is going to that funeral,

05:17.130 --> 05:18.497
and he's going to put the "bone"

05:18.498 --> 05:19.798
back in boneyard.

05:22.135 --> 05:23.969
Hmm, strange to be
on this side of the desk.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.004
Why?

05:25.005 --> 05:26.604
Oh, right,
you used to work here.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.440
<i>You know I made a lot
of improvements since you left?</i>

05:28.475 --> 05:30.443
I got a fridge
for my protein shakes.

05:30.444 --> 05:31.844
<i>I got a kettlebell station.</i>

05:31.845 --> 05:34.246
<i>I got a wolf
that I killed in Utah.</i>

05:34.247 --> 05:35.414
I'm fairly certain that's a dog.

05:35.415 --> 05:36.681
Yeah, it was dark.

05:36.717 --> 05:37.950
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need you

05:37.951 --> 05:39.352
to sign these...

05:39.353 --> 05:41.887
Captain Holt, I didn't
realize you were here.

05:41.888 --> 05:42.988
Sergeant Jeffords, hello.

05:42.989 --> 05:44.290
Welcome back.

05:44.291 --> 05:45.591
Hey, you know, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

05:45.592 --> 05:47.727
Hugs are a form of inappropriate
workplace touching.

05:47.728 --> 05:49.395
Trust me, I'm very familiar

05:49.396 --> 05:51.163
with the sexual harassment
guidelines.

05:51.164 --> 05:53.431
That'll be all.

05:53.467 --> 05:55.500
Well, I won't take up
too much of your time.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.536
Because the Nine-Nine
was Captain Dozerman's

05:57.537 --> 05:59.038
last precinct,
you will be seated

05:59.039 --> 06:00.373
at the front of the funeral.

06:00.374 --> 06:02.141
I wanted to alert you
that there'll be press,

06:02.142 --> 06:03.142
cameras...

06:03.143 --> 06:04.276
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cameras?

06:04.277 --> 06:05.610
<i>Crap, nobody said anything
about cameras.</i>

06:05.645 --> 06:07.112
I got to rock the bells.

06:09.116 --> 06:10.383
There we go.

06:10.384 --> 06:11.950
Oh, I noticed in the bullpen
that you had changed

06:11.985 --> 06:13.219
the case numbering system.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.552
I found, when I was
commanding officer, that...

06:14.588 --> 06:16.222
I'm gonna stop you right there.

06:16.223 --> 06:17.823
You're not commanding officer
anymore.

06:17.824 --> 06:19.058
I was making a suggestion.

06:19.059 --> 06:20.593
Yeah, look, you did a lot
of good for this place

06:20.594 --> 06:22.194
while you were here,
which is great for me,

06:22.195 --> 06:23.529
because I get
to take credit for it.

06:23.530 --> 06:25.030
But you're not a real cop
anymore.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.232
You're a desk jockey.

06:26.233 --> 06:27.799
This is my precinct now.

06:27.834 --> 06:31.737
And the sooner that you
accept that, the better.

06:31.738 --> 06:35.474
Yes, well, I know my way out.

06:35.475 --> 06:36.909
'Cause you used to work here.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.844
I keep forgetting.

06:38.845 --> 06:40.011
Everybody does.

06:41.848 --> 06:45.618
Well, well, if it isn't
Captain Raymond Jacob Holt.

06:45.619 --> 06:47.319
It's great to see you
back at the Nine-Nine, sir.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.521
Yes.

06:48.522 --> 06:50.356
There it is,
that classic Jake Holt banter,

06:50.357 --> 06:51.690
zingers just flying around.

06:51.691 --> 06:52.691
It's like you never left.

06:52.692 --> 06:54.893
No, I most definitely left.

06:54.928 --> 06:56.262
Okay.

06:56.263 --> 06:58.564
Well, I know how much
you love hot goss,

06:58.565 --> 07:00.466
so you probably heard
Amy and I have been dating.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.034
And we would love your approval.

07:02.035 --> 07:03.135
No.

07:03.136 --> 07:04.170
But that's not
what this is about.

07:04.171 --> 07:05.237
It sure is not.

07:05.238 --> 07:06.772
Sir, the Vulture
is out of control.

07:06.773 --> 07:08.107
All right, he told me
if I don't dump Amy,

07:08.108 --> 07:09.175
he's gonna demote me.

07:09.176 --> 07:10.309
You got to help us.

07:10.310 --> 07:11.410
Let me stop you
right there, Peralta.

07:11.411 --> 07:12.445
I'm not the Chief of Detectives.

07:12.446 --> 07:13.846
I'm not the Vulture's boss.

07:13.847 --> 07:15.747
I'm just some guy in PR.

07:15.782 --> 07:17.616
- But we thought...
- I can't save your ass.

07:17.617 --> 07:18.851
I don't work here anymore.

07:18.852 --> 07:21.287
And the sooner you accept that,

07:21.288 --> 07:22.554
the better.

07:25.659 --> 07:28.194
Well, looks like somebody's
got a bad case

07:28.195 --> 07:29.828
of the funeral crankies.

07:32.037 --> 07:33.036
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

07:33.038 --> 07:35.138
I know Captain Dozerman
was a nightmare

07:35.174 --> 07:36.741
and that none of us liked him.

07:36.742 --> 07:39.243
But I'm gonna need all of you
to pretend like you're sad.

07:39.278 --> 07:41.144
Everyone make a sad face.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.080
Scully, you are nailing it!

07:43.115 --> 07:45.149
My wife just texted.
She's leaving me.

07:45.150 --> 07:46.417
Good, use it.

07:46.418 --> 07:47.718
Now, anyone seen Captain Holt?

07:47.753 --> 07:49.420
He seemed a little down
when he came in.

07:49.421 --> 07:50.855
Yeah, he let me choose the music

07:50.856 --> 07:52.757
on the way over here,
which leads me to believe

07:52.758 --> 07:53.991
he's given up on life.

07:54.026 --> 07:55.226
<i>I got to go find him.</i>

07:55.227 --> 07:58.096
Now, be respectful
and grieve your asses off.

07:58.097 --> 07:59.764
I don't know
why this is happening.

07:59.765 --> 08:00.798
Scully, I love it!

08:00.799 --> 08:02.032
Everyone follow his lead.

08:04.637 --> 08:06.304
So what are we gonna do
about the Vulture?

08:06.305 --> 08:08.239
I've got a new plan.
Pretend like we're talking.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.440
- We are talking.
- Exactly.

08:09.441 --> 08:10.441
It's working already.

08:10.442 --> 08:11.576
Now I'm going to coolly

08:11.577 --> 08:13.177
run my hands through my hair.

08:13.178 --> 08:14.479
Look where my elbow's pointing.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.746
[gasps] It's Davis Garmin,

08:15.781 --> 08:17.081
Chief of Detectives.

08:17.082 --> 08:18.448
Holt said he could
overrule the Vulture.

08:18.484 --> 08:19.717
Exactly.

08:19.718 --> 08:21.478
The only question now is,
will he believe us?

08:21.487 --> 08:23.254
Yes, 'cause we're gonna
take a page

08:23.255 --> 08:24.521
from the Vulture's book.

08:24.556 --> 08:26.157
- "The Big Book of Small Butts"?
- What?

08:26.158 --> 08:27.525
It's the only thing
I've ever seen him read.

08:27.526 --> 08:29.560
No, we're gonna secretly
record the Vulture

08:29.561 --> 08:30.962
telling you to dump me.

08:30.963 --> 08:32.462
Then we'll play it
for Chief Garmin.

08:32.464 --> 08:33.464
Then...

08:33.465 --> 08:34.465
We're gonna totally

08:34.466 --> 08:36.198
have sex on top of each other.

08:36.235 --> 08:37.601
You get to keep your job.

08:37.635 --> 08:38.802
Yes, that.

08:41.273 --> 08:43.474
Ooh, Charles,
your jump-off is here.

08:43.475 --> 08:44.608
Hello, Detective.

08:44.643 --> 08:45.909
Hello, Lieutenant.

08:45.945 --> 08:47.577
Real tragic about the captain.

08:47.613 --> 08:49.279
Yes, real tragic.

08:49.315 --> 08:50.881
I like the way
your butt looks today.

08:50.916 --> 08:52.449
I've been doing lunges
in the shower.

08:52.484 --> 08:54.152
Well, this got upsetting
real quick.

08:54.153 --> 08:56.920
I want to live
in this moment forever.

08:56.956 --> 08:58.956
I got us a motel room
across the street.

08:58.991 --> 09:02.093
Meet me there in 15 minutes.

09:02.094 --> 09:03.695
I'll meet you, all right.

09:03.696 --> 09:05.529
M-E-A-T.

09:08.167 --> 09:10.568
Still think it's creepy?

09:10.569 --> 09:11.936
Yes.

09:11.937 --> 09:13.871
Charles, it is not like you
to have sex

09:13.872 --> 09:15.173
with a total stranger.

09:15.174 --> 09:16.874
Really, tell that to me
in an hour

09:16.875 --> 09:19.843
when we've had sex 23 times.

09:22.715 --> 09:24.248
There you are.

09:24.249 --> 09:25.249
You okay, sir?

09:25.250 --> 09:26.718
No.

09:26.719 --> 09:28.786
Until this morning,
some small part of me

09:28.787 --> 09:31.289
still believed I would be
captain of the Nine-Nine again.

09:31.290 --> 09:32.957
What a fool I was.

09:32.958 --> 09:34.358
I should never have returned.

09:34.393 --> 09:36.260
It's like visiting
your childhood home

09:36.261 --> 09:39.796
and seeing it's been replaced
by a denim pants store.

09:42.935 --> 09:45.535
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:45.571 --> 09:47.605
Slow down, sir.

09:47.606 --> 09:49.840
You didn't even stop
and sniff the bouquet.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.508
You always sniff the bouquet.

09:51.543 --> 09:52.677
Maybe the old Holt did.

09:52.678 --> 09:54.278
But the new Holt

without a care.

09:57.549 --> 09:59.717
Oh, it's a Sauternes glass.

09:59.718 --> 10:03.487
Look, the alcohol has
rendered me a simpleton.

10:03.522 --> 10:05.556
Maybe you should just
call it a day.

10:05.557 --> 10:06.991
I can't.

10:06.992 --> 10:09.727
I've been asked to deliver
a toast here after the funeral,

10:09.728 --> 10:12.797
a message of hope.

10:12.798 --> 10:14.398
This is what I have so far.

10:19.405 --> 10:22.039
"Pain..."

10:24.343 --> 10:26.044
That's it.

10:26.045 --> 10:27.445
One tweak...

10:27.446 --> 10:29.714
maybe you should lose
the word "pain"

10:29.715 --> 10:31.582
and then get in a cab
and go home.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.217
Maybe I will.

10:33.218 --> 10:37.021
But first, you're gonna have
one drink with me, Sergeant.

10:37.022 --> 10:38.356
For old times' sake?

10:38.357 --> 10:40.258
- One drink, and then we go.

organized those things myself.

15:22.564 --> 15:23.898
- Sir?
- Hmm?

15:23.899 --> 15:24.899
- Sir?
- Hmm?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.032
- Sir?
- Hmm?

15:26.068 --> 15:27.902
Can I be honest?

15:27.903 --> 15:29.737
Precinct's not the same
without you.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.772
The Vulture's the worst.

15:31.773 --> 15:33.440
My mango yogurt...

15:33.475 --> 15:34.708
Yes, you already mentioned
the yogurt.

15:34.743 --> 15:36.277
'Cause it's important!

15:36.278 --> 15:39.646
When I saw you
in the office this morning,

15:39.681 --> 15:41.982
I wanted to give you
the biggest hug.

15:42.017 --> 15:43.751
But the Vulture told you not to,

15:43.752 --> 15:44.852
and you had to listen.

15:44.853 --> 15:46.286
He's your captain now, Terry.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.357
I hate going to work
and you're not there.

15:49.358 --> 15:51.725
Everything is garbage.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.129
Hmm.
"Everything is garbage."

15:55.130 --> 15:57.798
I should put that in
my message of hope.

15:57.799 --> 15:59.899
That's a really good idea!

15:59.935 --> 16:02.737
It took my husband and me
years of counseling

16:02.738 --> 16:04.704
to get over those little
backwood orgies of yours.

16:04.740 --> 16:06.906
He had sex with five prostitutes
in one weekend.

16:06.942 --> 16:08.476
- Ugh!
- That's bananas!

16:08.477 --> 16:09.610
I had no idea.

16:09.611 --> 16:10.778
I was probably too busy praying.

16:10.779 --> 16:12.279
You said you planned the trips.

16:12.314 --> 16:15.349
- Yeah, I did say that.
- Called yourself the Coho King.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.484
All right, look.

16:16.485 --> 16:18.151
I'm not the Coho King.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.253
My name is Jake.

16:19.254 --> 16:20.688
And your husband
was only my captain

16:20.689 --> 16:21.689
for, like, a day.

16:21.690 --> 16:22.790
Wait a second.

16:22.791 --> 16:25.625
Are you the Jake
that killed him?

16:26.795 --> 16:28.663
No, I'm prostitute Jake.

16:28.664 --> 16:29.829
I love prostitutes.

16:29.865 --> 16:30.865
You need to go.

16:30.866 --> 16:31.999
<i>You should leave right now.</i>

16:32.000 --> 16:33.067
You need to leave right now.

16:33.068 --> 16:34.502
It's okay, Margaret.
Come on.

16:34.503 --> 16:36.537
Oh, Chief Garmin,
wait, I just...

16:36.538 --> 16:38.772
need to play you one
quick recording of my boss.

16:40.475 --> 16:41.942
You recorded me?

16:41.943 --> 16:43.244
That's not cool, Jake.

16:43.245 --> 16:45.179
Well, we were just taking
a page out of your book.

16:45.180 --> 16:46.614
Yeah? What are you
gonna do next, huh?

16:46.615 --> 16:48.281
Are you gonna start wearing
leather bracelets, hmm?

16:48.317 --> 16:49.916
Good luck pulling off
that chunky-B

16:49.951 --> 16:51.686
with those skinny little
girl wrists of yours.

16:51.687 --> 16:52.687
Congratulations.

16:52.688 --> 16:54.388
You're no longer a detective.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.190
You're a beat cop again.

16:56.191 --> 16:58.626
I just crushed your dreams.

16:58.627 --> 16:59.626
[clicks tongue]

17:02.798 --> 17:04.865
Okay, I know things
seem really bad right now,

17:04.866 --> 17:06.398
but we just need a minute
to think.

17:06.435 --> 17:09.269
[bagpipes playing
"Amazing Grace"]

17:09.304 --> 17:10.303
Come on, man!

17:14.233 --> 17:16.300
Okay, so the Vulture
has your phone.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.902
But new plan...

17:17.936 --> 17:19.271
Jake, we've had lots of plans,

17:19.271 --> 17:20.505
and none of them have worked.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.007
Yeah, but this is a good one.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.041
The new plan is: No plan.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.277
We wing it!

17:25.278 --> 17:26.344
Probably won't work,
but I said it

17:26.345 --> 17:27.444
with a lot of confidence.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.747
Jake, you got demoted.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.448
We said this relationship
wasn't gonna get

17:30.449 --> 17:32.250
in the way of our careers,
and it has.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.052
So what?
We'll figure it out.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.554
I'll make my way
back to detective.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.189
Or maybe you won't.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.257
I'm not gonna let you
throw away your dream job.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.792
Amy, this is good.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.994
This is a six-day relationship.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.096
We don't know what it is.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.998
And now for a message of hope.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.034
Ah, a message of hope,
right on time.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.969
Everything is garbage.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.003
Oh, no.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.438
You find something
you care about,

17:53.439 --> 17:55.040
and it's taken from you...

17:55.041 --> 17:56.507
your colleague,

17:56.542 --> 17:59.144
your dream job,

17:59.145 --> 18:00.145
your mango yogurt.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.213
Whoo!

18:01.214 --> 18:06.038
Never love anything.

18:08.426 --> 18:10.127
<i>That's the lesson.</i>

18:10.128 --> 18:11.462
To Captain Dozerman.

18:11.463 --> 18:12.896
All: Captain Dozerman.

18:12.897 --> 18:14.164
Thank you, sir.

18:14.165 --> 18:16.233
I'll take it from here.
Very poetic.

18:16.234 --> 18:19.303
If I might offer
a counter-toast of sorts.

18:19.304 --> 18:21.372
<i>Captain Dozerman and I,</i>

18:21.373 --> 18:23.507
we weren't together
for very long.

18:23.508 --> 18:25.109
In fact, as coworkers,

18:25.110 --> 18:28.312
our relationship
was only six days.

18:28.313 --> 18:29.747
<i>But that's not nothing.</i>

18:29.748 --> 18:31.181
It was long enough
for me to know

18:31.182 --> 18:32.750
that we had something special.

18:32.751 --> 18:34.952
<i>And sure,
there may be obstacles.</i>

18:34.953 --> 18:38.355
Him having passed away,
for example.

18:38.356 --> 18:40.291
<i>But I'm not giving up on us.</i>

18:40.292 --> 18:42.359
And I don't care
if I get demoted.

18:42.360 --> 18:47.164
I just care
about being with you...

18:47.165 --> 18:50.067
Captain Dozerman,

18:50.068 --> 18:51.769
an adult man

18:51.770 --> 18:53.337
<i>who has passed
into the nether world.</i>

18:53.338 --> 18:55.072
<i>Move over, Peralta!</i>

18:55.073 --> 18:56.807
Move over!

18:56.808 --> 18:57.841
Okay.

18:57.842 --> 19:00.944
And if I may do a third toast.

19:00.945 --> 19:04.848
It'll be focused primarily
on the mango yogurt.

19:04.849 --> 19:06.150
[all groan]

19:06.151 --> 19:07.384
Don't boo me!

19:07.385 --> 19:09.585
I lost something important
too, shoot.

19:12.624 --> 19:14.892
Thought I might find you here.

19:14.893 --> 19:17.261
So not a big fan
of my speech, huh?

19:17.262 --> 19:19.196
No, I loved it.

19:19.197 --> 19:21.598
I mean, I wish it hadn't
been at a wake.

19:21.599 --> 19:22.900
And I wish you hadn't
kept referring to me

19:22.901 --> 19:23.949
as your dead boss.

19:23.968 --> 19:25.602
Yeah, it pretty much sucked butt

19:25.603 --> 19:27.771
but still was somehow
the best of the three toasts.

19:27.772 --> 19:28.772
Hmm.

19:28.773 --> 19:30.074
Look, I don't want to break up.

19:30.075 --> 19:31.542
But I don't want
to get demoted either.

19:31.543 --> 19:33.476
I just don't know what to do.

19:33.511 --> 19:34.812
I'm all out of plans.

19:34.813 --> 19:36.680
I have one.

19:36.681 --> 19:38.615
Holt saves your ass.

19:38.616 --> 19:39.650
Captain.

19:39.651 --> 19:41.018
I was moved
by your speech, Peralta.

19:41.019 --> 19:42.519
Thank you, sir.
That's very nice of you to say.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.388
- The syntax was problematic.
- Less nice.

19:44.389 --> 19:46.056
And your vocabulary
is a true indictment

19:46.057 --> 19:47.224
of the public school system.

19:47.225 --> 19:48.559
Seems like you're just
slamming me now.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.561
But the fact that you're
not willing to give up

19:50.562 --> 19:52.863
in the face of adversity
is inspiring.

19:52.864 --> 19:54.631
I love the Nine-Nine,

19:54.632 --> 19:56.333
and I'm not gonna turn
my back on the squad.

19:56.334 --> 19:58.035
So I fixed your problem
with the Vulture.

19:58.036 --> 20:00.504
- Really?
- I may just be a guy in PR.

20:00.505 --> 20:03.307
But what does the Vulture
love more than anything?

20:03.308 --> 20:04.341
Garbage Pail Kids?

20:04.342 --> 20:06.377
No. Publicity.

20:06.378 --> 20:07.544
Captain Pembroke,
how would you like

20:07.545 --> 20:09.313
your face on the NYPD website?

20:09.314 --> 20:10.681
Really?

20:10.682 --> 20:12.383
Yes!
Yes!

20:12.384 --> 20:13.751
In exchange for media attention,

20:13.752 --> 20:14.985
the Vulture will not
bust you down

20:14.986 --> 20:16.687
or stand in the way
of you two dating.

20:16.688 --> 20:18.422
Sir, I don't know
how to thank you.

20:18.423 --> 20:20.891
Anything for the Nine-Nine.

20:20.892 --> 20:22.626
Thank you, sir.

20:22.627 --> 20:24.828
He totally approves of us.

20:24.829 --> 20:27.297
Whatcha doing there, Boyle?

20:27.298 --> 20:29.566
Trying to get drunk enough
to have sexual intercourse

20:29.567 --> 20:30.968
with a vegan.

20:30.969 --> 20:32.302
Why can't I just think
with my junk

20:32.303 --> 20:33.370
like a modern man?

20:33.371 --> 20:34.371
Why do you want to do that?

20:34.372 --> 20:35.406
[sighs]

20:35.407 --> 20:37.374
I got divorced,
and I was crushed.

20:37.375 --> 20:39.610
My fiancée left.
I cried for weeks.

20:39.611 --> 20:41.044
My only relationship that wasn't

20:41.045 --> 20:42.613
totally devastating
when it ended

20:42.614 --> 20:44.581
was my casual sex carnival
with Gina.

20:44.582 --> 20:45.642
Yeah, okay,

20:45.643 --> 20:47.017
But with of those relationships

20:47.018 --> 20:49.086
made you happiest
before it ended?

20:49.087 --> 20:50.052
[sighs]

20:50.053 --> 20:51.604
My marriage.
Vivian.

20:51.605 --> 20:53.857
Yeah, because you connect
with them emotionally,

20:53.858 --> 20:55.626
something we did not do

20:55.627 --> 20:57.461
because I'm a higher level
of being,

20:57.462 --> 20:59.096
like Her from the movie "Her."

20:59.097 --> 21:01.598
Dude, you can't go through
life trying not to get hurt.

21:01.599 --> 21:03.000
You should try to be happy.

21:03.001 --> 21:04.968
So you think I should
look for someone

21:04.969 --> 21:06.603
I can have emotional
intercourse with.

21:06.604 --> 21:08.605
I wish you hadn't said it
like that, but yeah.

21:08.606 --> 21:10.307
And I should start
right here at this funeral.

21:10.308 --> 21:11.308
I'd probably wait.

21:11.309 --> 21:12.843
Nope, no time to lose.

21:12.844 --> 21:14.111
Put on your sunglasses.

21:14.112 --> 21:15.579
I need to see if there's
anything in my teeth.

21:15.580 --> 21:16.913
Ugh.

21:19.284 --> 21:21.785
Oh, yeah.

21:21.786 --> 21:24.687
Charles Boyle is ready for love.

21:26.491 --> 21:28.558
Well, never wearing these again.
