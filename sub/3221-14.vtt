00:05.628 --> 00:07.998
You finally had a family
and you were building something.

00:08.498 --> 00:09.988
And it's as close to happiness...

00:10.367 --> 00:11.767
as I've ever seen a hunter get.

00:12.135 --> 00:14.385
- Dean?
- Ben, just stay there.

00:14.871 --> 00:16.241
- I thought I heard you...
- I said stay back!

00:19.275 --> 00:20.705
Ben won't even talk about it.

00:21.077 --> 00:24.357
This is the worst time in the universe
to talk. Can we do this later?

00:24.981 --> 00:27.321
You shoved my kid, Dean.
How about we do this now?

00:27.817 --> 00:29.987
- You and Ben...
- Me and Ben can't be in this with you.

00:31.821 --> 00:32.720
Lucifer's cage.

00:33.023 --> 00:34.513
Sam's soul is stuck in that box.

00:34.891 --> 00:36.321
Nasty, those memories.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.470
You don't wanna know
what they'll do to him.

00:39.896 --> 00:42.236
- Don't do this.
- Don't scratch the wall.

00:45.335 --> 00:47.295
Death didn't just shove your soul here.

00:47.737 --> 00:49.637
He put up the Great Wall of Sam
between you...

00:50.073 --> 00:51.803
and the things you don't remember.

00:52.208 --> 00:54.548
And trust me,
the things you don't know could kill you.

00:56.813 --> 00:58.773
Sammy? Sam.

01:00.417 --> 01:01.377
Sammy, talk to me.

01:12.829 --> 01:14.379
Sam.

01:16.833 --> 01:18.353
Sam.

01:19.135 --> 01:20.945
Sam?

01:27.710 --> 01:28.610
Sammy!

01:30.747 --> 01:32.207
Come on.

01:35.485 --> 01:36.445
Come on, damn it.

01:45.628 --> 01:47.968
- Hey, hey, hey. You with me?
- Ugh.

01:50.467 --> 01:53.687
Okay. Come on. Come on.
We gotta get the hell out of dodge.

02:57.734 --> 02:59.604
What the...?

03:10.013 --> 03:10.913
Who's there?

03:55.124 --> 03:56.674
Got it.

04:01.664 --> 04:03.094
How you feel?

04:04.500 --> 04:07.160
Like I got hit by a planet.

04:07.704 --> 04:12.304
Well, lucky for you I'm a doctor.
I got Joe, grub, and:

04:15.011 --> 04:16.880
- What are they?
- Effective.

04:19.249 --> 04:20.238
I'm okay. Thanks.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.079
Suit yourself.

04:24.921 --> 04:26.651
So how long was I out again?

04:27.056 --> 04:28.896
I'm telling you,
like two or three minutes.

04:29.325 --> 04:30.695
Why, what'd it feel like to you?

04:31.394 --> 04:33.614
About a week. Give or take.

04:36.599 --> 04:38.239
You wanna talk about it?

04:40.637 --> 04:42.337
- It?
- Yeah, whatever that was.

04:42.739 --> 04:44.879
I mean, it was like
you were freaking electrocuted.

04:51.581 --> 04:56.411
Look, I mean, it wasn't fun,
but I'm fine.

04:58.321 --> 05:00.021
Fine.

05:02.058 --> 05:03.758
It was hell, wasn't it?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.770
You got a big fat face-full of hell.

05:06.562 --> 05:08.262
Ever cross your mind
you could have died?

05:08.665 --> 05:10.155
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

05:10.566 --> 05:12.496
None of this
"it's just a flesh wound" crap.

05:12.935 --> 05:14.865
We did it your way,
we let you go explore...

05:15.305 --> 05:17.765
and every bad thing
that I said would happen, happened.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.734
So guess what? Past stays past.
We're not kicking that wall again.

05:22.378 --> 05:24.868
- So I'm supposed to just ignore it?
- Yes.

05:25.948 --> 05:29.228
Dean, I might have done...

05:30.219 --> 05:33.059
who knows what.
And you want me to just forget about it?

05:33.623 --> 05:35.613
You shove it down
and you let it come out...

05:36.092 --> 05:38.342
in spurts of violence
and alcoholism.

05:38.828 --> 05:41.868
- That sounds healthy.
- Well, works for me.

05:43.199 --> 05:45.039
This is not a joke.

05:46.469 --> 05:47.989
Your life is on the line here, Sam.

05:49.238 --> 05:50.548
This is not a debate.

05:51.507 --> 05:54.847
I mean, first you were
a soulless dickbag, and now you're not.

05:57.113 --> 05:58.043
So we good?

06:01.651 --> 06:02.991
Yeah. Sure.

06:05.254 --> 06:06.454
Good.

06:09.192 --> 06:11.062
Well, let's get your mind off it,
shall we?

06:11.494 --> 06:14.364
You, uh, up for a job?

06:15.698 --> 06:16.778
Why, what do you got?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.003
Janitor murdered in a college lab
last night.

06:19.435 --> 06:21.895
Doors were locked.
Nobody else in or out of the building.

06:22.405 --> 06:23.605
Great. Where to?

06:24.574 --> 06:28.144
Paterson, New Jersey. Hey, maybe
we'll have a Snooki sighting, ha, ha.

06:29.078 --> 06:30.948
What's a Snooki?

06:31.381 --> 06:32.841
That is a good question.

06:36.853 --> 06:39.923
Check it out.
These things are frigging awesome.

06:45.228 --> 06:47.598
- Be my Valentine?
- Dude, we're working. Put it back.

06:48.097 --> 06:48.997
- Have a heart.
- Dean.

06:50.566 --> 06:51.936
Buzzkill. Heh.

06:52.301 --> 06:54.261
You smell sulfur?

06:54.737 --> 06:56.487
Yeah, we're in a science lab.

06:56.906 --> 06:57.806
Right.

07:03.079 --> 07:04.599
Who is it?

07:09.886 --> 07:11.726
So, Lisa?

07:12.188 --> 07:14.848
- Mind your own business.
- What's wrong with talking to her?

07:15.391 --> 07:18.931
Thanks, Dr. Laura, that's very insightful.
Look at that, our time's up.

07:22.131 --> 07:23.441
Hey.

07:25.301 --> 07:26.701
<i>Ghosts Gone Wild.</i>

07:27.236 --> 07:28.256
Something's up in here.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.585
Question is, what?

07:37.947 --> 07:40.137
Sam, good news.

07:40.616 --> 07:42.076
Big Brother's watching.

08:18.488 --> 08:21.528
Hey. Ahem, so, what'd you find out
from the, uh, mop jockey's girlfriend?

08:22.124 --> 08:26.104
Nothing. Just how great he was.
Went to church. Donated to charity.

08:26.829 --> 08:29.319
<i>- Rubbed her feet during Glee.
- I just threw up in my mouth.</i>

08:29.832 --> 08:30.852
Sorry.

08:31.167 --> 08:34.386
Anyway, uh, checked his record, spotless.
What about the science building?

08:35.004 --> 08:36.784
Built in '05.
Nothing weird about the land.

08:37.206 --> 08:39.285
Uh, before this, the biggest mishap
was some genius...

08:39.775 --> 08:41.965
accidentally spilled sulfuric acid
on his crotch.

08:42.544 --> 08:44.535
They don't even dissect
anything good in there.

08:44.981 --> 08:46.501
I mean, bigger than Kermit,
they use an iPad.

08:48.551 --> 08:51.741
- So we got nothing?
- Yeah, a big steaming pile of it.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.810
Hello?

09:33.529 --> 09:34.459
Who's there?

09:40.603 --> 09:41.503
Jonny?

09:43.839 --> 09:45.649
Is that you?

09:54.150 --> 09:56.900
Okay, ha, ha, very funny.

10:06.462 --> 10:07.362
What the hell?

10:55.878 --> 10:57.218
- Got it?
- Yeah.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.850
All right.

11:06.522 --> 11:07.602
We're backing up.

11:07.923 --> 11:09.353
Yeah.

11:34.850 --> 11:36.490
Dean.

11:38.921 --> 11:41.231
- Yeah?
- This thing's humming.

11:41.724 --> 11:42.924
Hmm.

11:44.193 --> 11:47.733
Wait. That anatomy dummy
you were molesting at the lab.

11:48.397 --> 11:51.207
- Excuse me?
- What if that's what this is about?

11:52.535 --> 11:53.875
What are you accusing me of?

11:54.236 --> 11:58.776
I don't mean that. I mean, there was
an anatomy dummy there. And here...

12:01.577 --> 12:03.007
You're joking.

12:03.746 --> 12:05.326
You're not joking.

12:05.715 --> 12:10.755
Okay, uh, so what, we've got
a bunch of killer dolls like Chucky?

12:11.620 --> 12:13.490
I mean, come on, that's just...

12:15.725 --> 12:17.685
- frigging creepy.
- Huh.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.670
I mean, if ghosts can possess humans
and move objects...

12:21.163 --> 12:22.593
why can't they possess this?

12:25.568 --> 12:27.498
I suppose, but riddle me this, Batboy...

12:27.937 --> 12:31.417
ghosts aren't exactly known
for hopping county lines, right?

12:32.141 --> 12:34.221
- True.
- This one hits up a college...

12:34.677 --> 12:36.577
and now a factory,
what, three towns over?

12:37.012 --> 12:38.032
Doesn't add up.

12:40.015 --> 12:41.855
So we dig.

12:43.686 --> 12:45.676
Over there.

12:48.591 --> 12:51.081
I don't like the way
Kim Cattrall's looking at me.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.597
Well, this dead guy's as squeaky clean
as the last dead guy.

13:02.171 --> 13:04.341
I can't find a speck of dirt on him.
You?

13:04.807 --> 13:06.557
Nothing.

13:09.311 --> 13:10.211
Hmm.

13:10.513 --> 13:12.653
Well, here's a speck.

13:13.315 --> 13:16.885
A seamstress named Rose Brown
went missing over a year ago.

13:17.553 --> 13:18.783
Uh, cops just gave up on her.

13:19.522 --> 13:21.982
Last seen at the factory,
presumed dead...

13:23.325 --> 13:24.785
survived by sister, Isabel.

13:26.162 --> 13:27.892
Fifty bucks, vengeful spirit.

13:28.864 --> 13:30.354
Pay sis a visit?

13:31.634 --> 13:32.534
All right.

13:39.975 --> 13:41.815
Answer it.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.740
<i>- Lisa.
- Finally.</i>

13:53.355 --> 13:54.345
I've been calling.

13:55.391 --> 13:57.471
- Ben? What are you...?
- Something's wrong with Mom.

14:01.463 --> 14:03.683
- What are you talking about?
- It's bad, Dean.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.976
<i>- Define "bad."
- I don't know, she won't talk to me.</i>

14:07.536 --> 14:10.636
- Put her on the phone.
- She won't come to the phone.

14:12.508 --> 14:14.058
Get your mom
and put her on the phone.

14:14.476 --> 14:17.576
I can't, her door's locked.
She barely gets out of bed.

14:18.180 --> 14:19.290
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

14:19.615 --> 14:23.395
Please, just... Just come help me.
I don't know what to do.

14:24.086 --> 14:25.376
- Let me call you back.
- Dean.

14:25.721 --> 14:26.741
Five minutes.

14:30.426 --> 14:33.086
- Oh, come on, man. I can't just leave.
- Dude, you gotta leave.

14:33.629 --> 14:37.289
- But we're talking life or death here.
- Right, I can handle it for 24 hours.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.730
I get you wanna bury it,
but I had to deal with my past year...

14:41.270 --> 14:43.990
- you gotta deal with yours.
- That worked so great for you.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.270
Come on.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.130
- So you and Rose were close, huh?
- Very.

14:53.616 --> 14:56.716
Our parents died when we were little,
so we had each other.

14:57.786 --> 14:58.746
What was she like?

14:59.288 --> 15:01.158
Um, kind.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.340
Giving.

15:03.726 --> 15:05.866
She had the biggest heart.

15:07.229 --> 15:09.279
But people gave her a hard time.

15:09.732 --> 15:11.072
How come?

15:11.433 --> 15:13.543
She was shy. A little awkward.

15:14.036 --> 15:16.436
I guess that made her an easy target.

15:16.939 --> 15:20.129
- I've been defending her my whole life.
- I'm sure she appreciated it.

15:21.410 --> 15:23.520
Well, it went both ways.

15:24.313 --> 15:26.653
She did more for me
than anybody else ever could.

15:27.683 --> 15:29.673
I just miss her.

15:33.122 --> 15:36.052
- Um, may I?
- Sure, please.

15:42.998 --> 15:47.068
Um, that's the company Christmas party,
a couple years back.

15:48.270 --> 15:50.050
You work at Salzman & Sons too?

15:50.773 --> 15:53.553
Well, everybody works at the factory.
Yeah.

15:54.109 --> 15:56.189
And that's Rose.

16:06.388 --> 16:09.608
Dean. Hey, get this. That college janitor,
he worked at the factory too.

16:10.225 --> 16:13.385
Until last year. Apparently,
he quit right after Rose's disappearance.

16:13.996 --> 16:16.516
Fair bet something happened
to that girl around the factory.

16:17.032 --> 16:18.432
So let's call that ground zero.

16:18.801 --> 16:20.001
<i>But it still doesn't explain...</i>

16:20.336 --> 16:23.876
- how a ghost ended in another zip code.
- It's not like she hopped the Blue Line.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.030
I'm headed to the factory.
I'll call when I get the whole scoop.

16:45.928 --> 16:47.598
How long have you been
with the company?

16:47.997 --> 16:48.897
About three years now.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.877
Heh, I'm sorry,
what's, uh, this got to do with me?

16:57.373 --> 16:59.363
Relax. Just a routine questioning.

17:00.676 --> 17:01.816
Okay.

17:02.144 --> 17:03.784
Uh, well, did you know Rose Brown?

17:06.048 --> 17:07.627
Uh...

17:08.017 --> 17:09.797
Maybe.

17:10.219 --> 17:13.289
Heh, uh,
the name sounds kind of familiar.

17:16.858 --> 17:20.368
She was a seamstress here.
She went missing about a year ago.

17:21.363 --> 17:22.703
Here...

17:23.065 --> 17:24.234
you mind taking a look?

17:28.369 --> 17:30.010
Uh, yeah, I saw her around.

17:34.109 --> 17:37.129
Anything you can tell me about her
that might help?

17:38.680 --> 17:43.340
Heh, look, I'd love to help,
but I don't know anything.

17:44.186 --> 17:46.646
And, uh, I'm about to be late
back from break, so...

17:47.189 --> 17:49.589
You seem nervous, Jonny.

17:52.995 --> 17:57.775
Well, heh, those guys that died
were my friends.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.000
- I mean, of course I'm gonna be upset.
- I didn't say upset. I said nervous.

18:07.943 --> 18:08.963
Here.

18:11.513 --> 18:13.623
In case you remember anything.

18:38.273 --> 18:40.233
Dean, what are you doing here?

18:40.676 --> 18:42.726
Well, you look absolutely fine.

18:44.246 --> 18:45.236
What's going on?

18:48.584 --> 18:50.074
<i>We've been Parent Trap'd.</i>

18:50.452 --> 18:52.202
- What?
- Ben sent out a 911.

18:52.621 --> 18:53.671
Why would he do that?

18:54.656 --> 18:56.736
You're going on a date, huh?

19:00.062 --> 19:01.142
Come in.

19:11.807 --> 19:14.497
- You wanna sit down?
- Not so much.

19:17.546 --> 19:19.566
So who's the guy?

19:22.818 --> 19:24.598
Who's the guy?

19:26.822 --> 19:27.932
His name's Matt.

19:28.290 --> 19:31.190
- He's a doctor.
- Oh, Dr. Matt.

19:31.793 --> 19:34.663
- How respectable.
- Really? That's how this is gonna be?

19:39.034 --> 19:40.994
- Look, I...
- I called you six times, Dean.

19:41.436 --> 19:43.626
- I almost called back about a hundred.
- Good to know.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.096
Lis, Ben called me.

19:45.407 --> 19:48.567
I dropped everything and ran.
If you wanna know if I care...?

19:49.178 --> 19:51.138
- Doesn't help me.
- What do you want from me?

19:51.580 --> 19:54.770
- I'm not asking for anything.
- Well, then ask for something.

19:57.186 --> 19:58.086
Um...

19:58.387 --> 20:00.287
Go to your room.

20:13.035 --> 20:16.845
You know, I...
I can't ask for something.

20:20.342 --> 20:22.272
I know what I want...

20:23.045 --> 20:26.265
but I can't have it, not how you live.

20:27.583 --> 20:30.833
My phone rings,
I think, tiny chance it's you.

20:31.787 --> 20:33.957
Big chance it's Sam calling
to tell me you're dead.

20:34.423 --> 20:36.203
- Lis...
- No, don't.

20:37.893 --> 20:40.763
Don't apologize, or anything.

20:42.497 --> 20:43.757
It's just...

20:44.099 --> 20:47.169
I get to this place where I'm okay
and then you show up at our door.

20:48.170 --> 20:51.950
You keep doing that. Every time I think
I'm never gonna see you again.

20:53.442 --> 20:55.172
I'm trying to get over you.

20:57.379 --> 20:59.519
What are you trying to do?

21:00.482 --> 21:02.412
What do you want from us, Dean?

21:21.770 --> 21:23.440
Why am I flipping out?

21:23.839 --> 21:25.589
I don't know,
maybe because of the feds...

21:26.008 --> 21:28.878
and because Dave and Steve
are freaking dead.

21:29.778 --> 21:32.558
Look, ugh, no. No.

21:33.115 --> 21:35.255
Just call me later.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.600
Come on.

22:10.085 --> 22:11.955
What's going on?

22:15.123 --> 22:17.403
That was a ghost
trying to kill you for being a dick.

22:17.893 --> 22:19.473
What?

22:20.562 --> 22:21.582
You know what?

22:21.897 --> 22:24.937
You're lucky you were
the most suspicious interview of all time.

22:26.034 --> 22:27.934
I figured something like this
would happen.

22:28.370 --> 22:29.770
Something like what would happen?

22:30.138 --> 22:32.538
I don't have time for the big speech,
all right?

22:33.308 --> 22:35.448
So brass tacks: Rose is back.

22:36.411 --> 22:37.371
That's crazy.

22:38.046 --> 22:41.526
You're gonna end up like your friends
unless you tell me what you did to Rose.

22:46.154 --> 22:47.674
Do you want me to help you or not?

22:53.729 --> 22:57.159
It was just a stupid joke.
You know, I mean, you play jokes.

22:58.066 --> 22:59.556
We didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

23:02.938 --> 23:04.778
What did you do?

23:07.943 --> 23:09.813
We made Rose think
she had a secret admirer.

23:22.858 --> 23:25.348
I don't think the girl
had ever been asked out in her life.

23:26.428 --> 23:29.798
<i>Honestly, she was kind of pathetic.</i>

23:36.671 --> 23:38.101
<i>So we knew she'd take the bait.</i>

23:51.987 --> 23:54.037
<i>She was so excited.</i>

24:00.228 --> 24:01.868
<i>Poor girl never saw it coming.</i>

24:18.613 --> 24:20.423
Look, Rose, I think he likes you.

24:21.883 --> 24:24.843
It was mean. But you know how it is
when a group of guys get together.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.940
They act like jackasses.

24:29.224 --> 24:30.514
Oh, don't be like that.

24:30.859 --> 24:33.229
Come on, Rosey, it's just a joke.

24:37.732 --> 24:39.312
Go to hell.

24:39.701 --> 24:41.311
It happened so fast.

24:42.003 --> 24:45.253
Hey, take a joke, Rosey, seriously.

24:54.149 --> 24:56.079
<i>We didn't mean for it to happen.</i>

24:59.521 --> 25:00.691
And then it was too late.

25:06.394 --> 25:08.294
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the cops.

25:08.730 --> 25:10.460
- Are you crazy?
- It was an accident.

25:10.866 --> 25:14.466
We tricked her here, I grabbed her.
That's involuntary manslaughter at least.

25:15.170 --> 25:17.980
And that's if they even believe us.
You understand?

25:19.441 --> 25:21.141
Steve said there was only one option.

25:27.048 --> 25:28.478
I wish I could take it all back.

25:29.251 --> 25:31.471
- I'm sure you do.
- I didn't kill her.

25:31.953 --> 25:35.673
Okay, look me in the eyes
and tell me none of it's on you.

25:40.729 --> 25:43.569
Look, I'm not saying you deserve to die.

25:46.268 --> 25:47.578
I can help you.

25:47.936 --> 25:50.396
- How?
- You have to tell me where she's buried.

25:51.907 --> 25:54.597
In the woods.
Uh, a clearing off Canyon Run Road.

25:57.245 --> 25:59.235
- No, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
- But I...

25:59.714 --> 26:02.404
You need to stay inside the salt line
until I tell you you're safe.

26:04.252 --> 26:06.362
You just want me to stand here
all night?

26:07.522 --> 26:09.772
Consider it getting off easy.

26:27.342 --> 26:30.362
That's ridiculous,
plants could never kill a zombie.

26:30.946 --> 26:32.496
You think I'm gonna say I'm sorry?

26:32.881 --> 26:35.311
Why would I think that,
because you lied to get me here?

26:35.817 --> 26:36.957
It was an emergency.

26:37.285 --> 26:39.625
A date's not an emergency, Ben.

26:40.121 --> 26:41.791
It is if it's the third one.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.000
I watch TV, I know what that means.

26:59.274 --> 27:01.644
Well, your mom's a grownup...

27:02.477 --> 27:03.847
she gets to go out.

27:04.212 --> 27:05.472
Why won't you come home?

27:05.814 --> 27:08.334
Can't you just say "I'm sorry"
and then come back?

27:11.052 --> 27:12.892
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Can't or won't?

27:13.722 --> 27:15.452
- Both.
- So you hate Mom now?

27:15.857 --> 27:16.937
What? No. Come on.

27:17.292 --> 27:18.992
- So it's me.
- Ben, stop it.

27:19.394 --> 27:22.174
- Whatever I did, I'm sorry.
- Listen to me.

27:23.531 --> 27:27.011
You didn't do anything.
You understand that?

27:30.572 --> 27:32.622
Look, one day you'll, uh...

27:33.441 --> 27:34.901
You'll get this, when you're older.

27:35.310 --> 27:36.860
Don't talk to me like I'm 6.

27:39.748 --> 27:41.588
Okay, fine.

27:44.085 --> 27:46.135
It's like this then.

27:47.389 --> 27:49.499
Just because you love someone...

27:49.958 --> 27:53.358
doesn't mean you should stick around
and screw up their life.

27:54.462 --> 27:56.132
So I can't be here.

27:57.265 --> 27:59.755
You think something
will follow you home?

28:01.036 --> 28:02.616
No.

28:04.339 --> 28:07.089
No, I don't. But I think my job
turns me into somebody...

28:07.642 --> 28:10.072
that can't sit at your dinner table.

28:10.578 --> 28:13.678
And if I stayed,
you'd end up just like me.

28:15.617 --> 28:18.427
Why do you say it like you're so bad?

28:18.987 --> 28:22.057
Heh, trust me, I'm not someone
you wanna aim to be.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.237
- Don't I get a vote?
- No, you don't.

28:26.294 --> 28:27.554
I'm sorry, Ben.

28:28.463 --> 28:31.803
But, you see, this way you got a shot
at living whatever life you want.

28:32.434 --> 28:34.894
You know, pick one. Pick five.

28:35.870 --> 28:38.740
Because with me,
there's just the one road.

28:39.641 --> 28:41.661
- You're a liar, Dean.
- Excuse me?

28:42.110 --> 28:43.570
You say family's so important.

28:43.945 --> 28:45.905
But what do you call people
who care for you...

28:46.381 --> 28:48.631
who love you
even when you're a dick?

28:49.918 --> 28:52.848
You know you're walking out
on your family, right?

29:28.990 --> 29:31.740
All right. It's over, you're safe.

29:32.293 --> 29:35.663
Jonny,
look at this as a new beginning.

29:36.297 --> 29:38.847
Lot of chances not to be a jackass.

31:17.165 --> 31:19.685
Jenny? Hon...

31:21.102 --> 31:23.502
we're leaving. Tonight.

31:24.038 --> 31:26.728
So pack up. Just the essentials.

31:32.347 --> 31:34.777
All I want is for us
to move on with our lives.

31:36.150 --> 31:39.050
I love you. You know that.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.525
It's been, ugh...

31:42.924 --> 31:44.824
It's been really hard, Jen.

32:20.628 --> 32:22.528
<i>This is Dean's other other cell...</i>

32:22.964 --> 32:24.224
<i>so you must know what to do.</i>

32:24.565 --> 32:27.695
Hey, it's not over.
Burning the remains didn't stop her.

32:28.303 --> 32:29.943
She's gotta be hooked
to something else.

32:30.338 --> 32:32.918
I'm gonna head to the sister's now.
Call me.

32:40.715 --> 32:43.205
So, um, this is it?

32:44.719 --> 32:47.029
I gave most of her clothes
to the Goodwill.

32:47.522 --> 32:49.222
She didn't have much.

32:51.726 --> 32:53.016
- Those yours?
- Yeah.

32:53.361 --> 32:55.061
- Are you in school?
- Mm-hm, yeah.

32:55.463 --> 32:57.043
- Where?
- Uh, Great Falls.

33:03.037 --> 33:03.937
So let me guess.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.030
Um...

33:07.342 --> 33:09.862
You were at the chem lab
and the factory this week.

33:11.546 --> 33:12.476
Well, yeah.

33:15.216 --> 33:18.756
Did you happen to stop by a bar
called McOwen's last night?

33:20.588 --> 33:22.168
Everybody from the factory
goes there.

33:22.557 --> 33:25.517
I stop in maybe three times a week.

33:26.761 --> 33:28.371
Why?

33:31.132 --> 33:32.712
That's it. Huh.

33:33.735 --> 33:35.285
So this is all about you.

33:35.703 --> 33:36.933
- What? What is?
- The murders.

33:37.271 --> 33:39.791
Your co-workers. Your college janitor.

33:40.308 --> 33:42.648
What, you think
I could do something like that?

33:43.144 --> 33:45.604
No, no, no.
But I think you're at the center.

33:46.647 --> 33:48.427
- Me? How?
- What are you wearing of Rose's?

33:48.850 --> 33:51.400
A ring? A bracelet?
Her baby teeth in a locket? What?

33:51.919 --> 33:53.559
- You're scaring me.
- Just think, please.

33:53.955 --> 33:56.615
What do you have of Rose's
that you carry with you?

33:59.761 --> 34:01.281
What?

34:01.929 --> 34:04.479
Well, the only thing I have of hers
is a part of me.

34:06.167 --> 34:08.306
When I was 16,
she gave me one of her kidneys.

34:10.271 --> 34:11.761
- Her kidney?
- Yeah.

34:12.672 --> 34:15.422
- You're kidding.
- Will you tell me what this is about?

34:15.976 --> 34:17.206
Yeah, um...

34:18.513 --> 34:20.703
But I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.612
- That the girl with the haunted kidney?
- Yeah.

34:41.135 --> 34:43.094
Just when you think you've seen it all.

34:43.704 --> 34:46.364
What do you wanna do?
We can't burn the thing, she needs it.

34:46.908 --> 34:49.098
She can't walk around with it.
The spirit's attached.

34:49.577 --> 34:52.567
It's gonna use her to get revenge.
It's not gonna stop killing.

34:53.147 --> 34:55.337
- You suggesting we cut it out of her?
- And then what?

34:55.817 --> 34:58.597
Leave her in a tub of ice
with a phone taped to her hand?

34:59.153 --> 35:00.493
Maybe we should call Dr. Robert.

35:00.855 --> 35:03.375
He might have some leads
on non-haunted replacement kidneys.

35:03.891 --> 35:06.991
- He works out of a butcher shop.
- It's pretty clean, you'd be surprised.

35:07.595 --> 35:09.495
- No. I think we have to go hoodoo.
- Hoodoo?

35:09.931 --> 35:11.161
Yeah.

35:11.499 --> 35:14.569
- That's more of a Band-Aid, not a cure.
- It buys us a minute.

35:15.169 --> 35:17.479
- All right. Louisiana it is.
- Voodoo?

35:18.606 --> 35:20.156
What the hell are you talking about?

35:20.541 --> 35:22.501
Actually, it's hoodoo,
it's a little different.

35:22.944 --> 35:24.464
- Hold on, Isabel.
- You're not feds.

35:24.879 --> 35:26.109
Just let us explain.

35:28.349 --> 35:30.019
No.

35:30.551 --> 35:32.281
- No way.
- That's impossible.

35:33.387 --> 35:35.317
No, no, no.

35:35.756 --> 35:37.896
She possesses sex dolls.
This is not a sex doll.

35:40.695 --> 35:43.505
Hey, you leave my baby alone.
She's got nothing to do with this!

35:45.833 --> 35:47.943
Go! Go! Go!

35:49.704 --> 35:50.964
Here. Here. Here. Get in.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.150
Son of a bitch!

36:13.127 --> 36:14.737
I'm so sorry, baby.

36:26.374 --> 36:28.074
Hey.

36:29.911 --> 36:32.081
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. You guys?

36:33.381 --> 36:34.781
Yeah.

36:35.616 --> 36:37.166
Yeah, I'm...

36:43.124 --> 36:44.554
Isabel.

36:44.926 --> 36:46.596
Hey, hey, hey.

37:07.348 --> 37:09.278
I'm sorry.

37:10.851 --> 37:13.131
I didn't mean for this.

37:46.454 --> 37:47.474
How's it look?

37:49.257 --> 37:51.807
Well, considering she got carjacked
by poltergeist...

37:52.326 --> 37:54.106
could be worse.

37:56.497 --> 37:58.397
What exactly did we do back there,
Sam?

38:01.269 --> 38:03.349
Yeah, I'm not putting it
in the win column either.

38:03.804 --> 38:07.024
We saved a few dicks
and we killed an innocent girl.

38:09.810 --> 38:13.180
I got a heartbroken kid
and a woman who's so pissed at me...

38:14.882 --> 38:17.602
I see what you mean
about facing your past. It's, uh, heh.

38:18.152 --> 38:19.962
- It's awesome. Thanks.
- Dean.

38:20.388 --> 38:22.938
- I mean, all we do is make a mess.
- That's not true.

38:24.325 --> 38:27.545
We do save lives, now and again.

38:31.732 --> 38:35.392
Yeah, I guess. I'm just... I'm just tired
of all the bad luck, you know?

38:36.103 --> 38:39.823
Well, you know, number one, bad luck
is kind of in the job description.

38:40.508 --> 38:42.618
And two, it's not all bad.

38:43.110 --> 38:46.100
Really. Look at me. I mean,
at least Satan's left the building.

38:48.115 --> 38:50.225
Yeah. It's the little things.

38:52.553 --> 38:55.593
And I have a soul, because of you.

38:56.190 --> 38:58.650
I never thanked you for that, did I?

38:59.393 --> 39:01.233
- That's all good, man.
- Well, thanks.

39:03.531 --> 39:05.811
- You'd have done the same for me.
- I mean it.

39:08.002 --> 39:11.192
Look, we keep our heads down,
keep swinging.

39:12.573 --> 39:15.293
We'll lose some,
hopefully, we'll win more.

39:15.843 --> 39:17.483
And...

39:19.146 --> 39:22.306
I don't know.
Anyway, for what it's worth...

39:22.917 --> 39:24.177
I got your back.

39:26.887 --> 39:28.347
Yeah, I know.
