00:12.560 --> 00:13.454
Susan!

00:17.426 --> 00:18.704
- Good morning.
- Yes, it is.

00:18.899 --> 00:21.071
I'd even say it's a glorious morning.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.091
Didn't your mother teach you
not to gloat?

00:23.318 --> 00:25.261
What good's a vacation
if you can't gloat?

00:25.527 --> 00:27.601
Just think, in eight days,
you'll be back here...

00:27.864 --> 00:30.616
...slogging miserably through life
like the rest of us.

00:30.842 --> 00:33.877
But tomorrow, I will be in Maui
with the sun in my face...

00:34.108 --> 00:35.286
...drinking a Sea Breeze.

00:35.517 --> 00:36.947
I hope you burn.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.262
Thanks for housesitting.
My cat owes you.

00:39.487 --> 00:43.067
I'll try to remember to feed her.
I hope you recognize the hospital...

00:43.298 --> 00:45.403
...when you get back.
Anspaugh's planning changes.

00:45.634 --> 00:46.649
Like what?

00:47.203 --> 00:49.571
I don't know,
but I'm philosophically opposed.

00:49.797 --> 00:52.581
That's my new motto:
Change is not good.

00:52.774 --> 00:54.783
Well, we're getting more Residents.

00:55.016 --> 00:56.544
We'll work twice as hard.

00:57.353 --> 00:58.761
- What?
- They're from Southside.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.736
Their program is
less than discriminating.

01:01.963 --> 01:05.894
We'll spend half our time trying to
keep them from killing the patients.

01:06.126 --> 01:07.272
Okay, I'm coming!

01:12.114 --> 01:14.570
Good morning, Dr. Carter.
I saw your car in the garage.

01:14.802 --> 01:16.626
I didn't want you to oversleep again.

01:16.852 --> 01:19.188
I'm not on for another two hours,
but thanks.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.072
I brought you some borscht.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.802
Here, here.

01:23.576 --> 01:26.360
They eat this for breakfast in Russia.

01:27.322 --> 01:30.422
Thank you for helping me fix
my tank the other day.

01:30.684 --> 01:34.002
I hate this damn thing!
It's like dragging an anchor.

01:34.270 --> 01:36.376
Just don't light
that cigarette around it.

01:36.607 --> 01:40.155
By the way, I've been feeling this
little waxy buildup in my ear.

01:40.385 --> 01:44.282
- Would you take a look at it?
- Ears really aren't my specialty.

01:44.900 --> 01:48.131
But there is a family practitioner
who lives on the second floor.

01:48.359 --> 01:49.253
Really?

01:49.479 --> 01:51.870
He is so much more qualified
than I am.

01:52.105 --> 01:54.954
Thank you, Dr. Carter!
I'll be back for that bowl.

01:55.145 --> 01:56.258
Okay, then.

02:00.237 --> 02:03.108
- Isn't this exciting?
- Like a junior-high assembly.

02:03.375 --> 02:04.750
Here comes the assistant principal.

02:04.975 --> 02:08.622
Susan, meet Margaret Doyle, one
of our new interns from Southside.

02:08.848 --> 02:09.613
Maggie.

02:09.842 --> 02:10.606
Pleasure.

02:14.004 --> 02:15.729
Wonder what med school she went to.

02:15.958 --> 02:17.901
Guys, come on.
I saved you a seat.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.561
You look like hell.
You pull an all nighter?

02:21.785 --> 02:26.065
Price is sick, so they called me in.
Interrupted a very promising date.

02:26.299 --> 02:27.926
Good morning.
Thanks for coming.

02:28.124 --> 02:31.476
I'm due in surgery in 10 minutes,
so I'll make this snappy.

02:31.711 --> 02:32.474
We're in trouble.

02:32.704 --> 02:35.705
With the closing of Southside
Hospital, we can expect an increase...

02:35.969 --> 02:39.768
...of at least 30 percent in our
normal patient load here at County.

02:40.324 --> 02:43.871
To meet these demands, we'll institute
the efficiency standards...

02:44.102 --> 02:47.780
...that made the Southside ER,
no offense, the best in the city.

02:48.424 --> 02:49.669
All Residents and Attendings...

02:50.186 --> 02:53.318
...will see an average
of 2.5 patients per hour.

02:53.547 --> 02:56.232
Your patient quotient will
be checked on a daily basis.

02:56.461 --> 02:58.121
The highest PQ wins a gumdrop.

02:58.350 --> 03:00.522
The lowest has to wax my car.

03:00.719 --> 03:02.443
- What about the dead?
- I'm sorry?

03:02.672 --> 03:06.537
DOAs, train wrecks who croak on the
way in. Do we get points for them?

03:06.802 --> 03:07.786
Yes, you do.

03:08.051 --> 03:11.533
But try not to kill all your
patients at once, Dr. Greene.

03:11.797 --> 03:13.741
We wouldn't want to draw suspicion.

03:14.007 --> 03:14.956
Who handles scheduling?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.263
- I do.
- Will you make sure that I'm cc'd?

03:17.497 --> 03:18.709
Chart review?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.083
That's me too.

03:20.315 --> 03:22.323
I want a daily summary.
And budget?

03:23.709 --> 03:24.472
It's me.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.937
Greene, aren't you an Attending here?

03:27.230 --> 03:29.501
I'm patient ombudsman,
I run the mentoring program...

03:29.729 --> 03:31.639
...and I'm in charge of staff morale.

03:31.841 --> 03:33.631
Let's even out the duties a bit.

03:33.859 --> 03:36.249
You take chart review.
Get me a report by noon.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.143
Change is like a freight train:

03:38.469 --> 03:40.707
You're either onboard
or grit in the gears.

03:41.159 --> 03:42.468
Same time Tuesday.

03:43.432 --> 03:44.807
I think he likes you.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.653
It was ugly.
It was the ugliest thing I ever saw.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.072
It was big like a bear and fearsome.
Well, look what he done to me.

04:44.298 --> 04:45.095
What's this?

04:45.322 --> 04:48.193
Dante says a kangaroo attacked him
in Humboldt Park.

04:48.460 --> 04:49.409
That's a nasty cut.

04:49.677 --> 04:53.027
He had a claw like a razor!
Smelled like an elephant's ass.

04:53.263 --> 04:54.758
Exam 6.

04:55.152 --> 04:57.226
Jerry, who was Attending last night?

04:57.457 --> 04:58.406
Mishkin.

04:58.642 --> 05:02.125
Get him on the phone because
I can't read his handwriting.

05:02.549 --> 05:03.979
Stuck in chart review hell?

05:04.214 --> 05:06.671
I've been here an hour,
and I haven't seen a patient.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.742
Better pick it up, or you'll
be waxing Anspaugh's car.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.050
One down. Anyone got
the broken tib-fib in 2?

05:12.282 --> 05:14.804
Actually, I'd rather
you stayed supervised.

05:15.068 --> 05:16.726
- Doug, did you meet...?
- Maggie Doyle.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.871
Maggie, I'm Doug. How are you?

05:19.135 --> 05:21.438
I was handling my own cases
at Southside.

05:21.663 --> 05:23.998
It's your first day.
I'd like you to stick with Doug.

05:24.256 --> 05:27.554
Get on the P.A. And tell the idiot
with the BMW to get out of my spot.

05:27.779 --> 05:29.089
Space 37?

05:30.180 --> 05:31.391
Security told me to park there.

05:31.621 --> 05:34.557
Space 37 is mine. It's been
my space for the past three years.

05:34.951 --> 05:38.783
- Meet Carol Hathaway, our head nurse.
- And head of the welcoming committee.

05:39.017 --> 05:39.781
I'll move.

05:40.394 --> 05:41.322
Good.

05:44.172 --> 05:44.935
Who's that?

05:45.645 --> 05:46.594
Intern from Southside.

05:46.862 --> 05:50.377
- An intern with a BMW?
- I thought your car was repossessed.

05:50.928 --> 05:52.303
It's still my spot.

05:56.372 --> 06:00.432
Before I do the stitches, I'll give
you medicine so they won't hurt.

06:00.662 --> 06:02.735
I'll even let you choose
the color of thread.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.750
We've got blue, purple, black.

06:06.361 --> 06:09.843
Jeanie, can I talk to you
for a minute outside?

06:11.548 --> 06:12.596
I'll be right back.

06:17.055 --> 06:19.325
You should call an intern
to do those sutures.

06:19.552 --> 06:21.113
They have other things to do.

06:21.570 --> 06:24.834
Have you told the mother or
the patient you're HIV-positive?

06:25.092 --> 06:26.619
None of your damn business.

06:31.079 --> 06:31.973
All right.

06:34.057 --> 06:35.465
It's gonna hurt for a second.

06:35.946 --> 06:39.460
Get these charts out of my face,
and get me a sick person to fix.

06:39.692 --> 06:42.115
Actually, the board is covered
right now.

06:42.349 --> 06:46.344
Kleinman's been turfed in Neuro.
Figueroa has been discharged.

06:46.544 --> 06:48.455
And Noyne signed out AMA.

06:48.689 --> 06:51.210
Your labs on Otis and Fenning came up.

06:51.475 --> 06:52.883
Okay. Thank you.

06:53.556 --> 06:55.215
- You're cooking.
- Heal them and deal them.

06:55.444 --> 06:56.819
Besides, in...

06:57.686 --> 07:01.878
...46 hours and 18 minutes,
I will be in...

07:02.105 --> 07:02.869
Don't say it.

07:03.097 --> 07:04.985
...Maui, Maui, Maui.

07:05.210 --> 07:07.994
You're cruel. I haven't had
a day off since Christmas.

07:10.813 --> 07:12.341
Why don't you come with me?

07:12.575 --> 07:13.524
Yeah, right.

07:16.993 --> 07:18.270
You're kidding, right?

07:19.234 --> 07:21.145
I don't know.
You have the time coming...

07:21.412 --> 07:23.452
...and there's plenty of people
to cover for you.

07:25.189 --> 07:27.558
- What about your cat?
- I can ask a neighbor.

07:28.488 --> 07:30.277
- This guy's crashing.
- I'm coming.

07:32.778 --> 07:33.793
We'll talk later.

07:34.027 --> 07:34.954
Sure.

07:37.997 --> 07:39.786
Morning. How are you?

07:40.014 --> 07:41.576
- I've been better.
- Me too.

07:41.807 --> 07:44.973
So did you see if the triage nurse
brought your chart back?

07:45.201 --> 07:46.030
I don't know.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.014
What seems to be the problem?

07:48.499 --> 07:50.092
Kidney stones.
I've had them in the past.

07:50.324 --> 07:52.147
Woke up with the same pain
this morning.

07:52.373 --> 07:55.987
It starts back here, and it works
its way around front and then down.

07:56.247 --> 07:58.704
It sounds like a stone.
We'll wanna do a CAT scan.

07:58.969 --> 08:01.174
Let's get you in a gown first.

08:03.035 --> 08:04.759
Do you eat a lot of ice cream?

08:05.020 --> 08:06.548
Yes, actually.

08:06.781 --> 08:08.757
- Drink tea?
- Almost every day.

08:08.991 --> 08:10.104
Why do you ask?

08:10.335 --> 08:13.239
The calcium from the ice cream
combined with the oxalate in the tea...

08:13.473 --> 08:15.231
...forms calcium oxalate stones.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.117
A simple ionic bond.

08:18.020 --> 08:18.816
It makes sense.

08:19.045 --> 08:20.190
Mr. Sidowski?

08:20.389 --> 08:21.732
That's right.

08:21.957 --> 08:24.927
I was in your chemistry class
at St. Monica's. Carol.

08:25.416 --> 08:26.759
Hathaway.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.665
Second row, right near the window.

08:31.019 --> 08:32.929
God! I can't believe you remember.

08:33.196 --> 08:34.921
I remember the good ones.

08:36.046 --> 08:37.934
I always knew you'd do well.

08:38.607 --> 08:39.753
Here you are, a doctor.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.663
You specialize in emergency
medicine or surgery or...?

08:43.890 --> 08:46.280
No. I'm a nurse, actually.

08:46.515 --> 08:47.409
In the ER.

08:47.733 --> 08:48.943
A nurse?

08:51.607 --> 08:53.070
That's wonderful.

08:58.810 --> 08:59.957
What's the story?

09:00.219 --> 09:01.944
They found him obtunded
at his board-and-care.

09:02.173 --> 09:04.695
BP's 50 over 30.
Pulse weak at 130.

09:04.926 --> 09:05.909
No tendon reflexes.

09:06.175 --> 09:07.037
No response to pain.

09:07.264 --> 09:10.429
This IV's blown. Vein's too weak
to hold. What's his name?

09:10.658 --> 09:13.626
- Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson! Mr. Johnson?

09:14.148 --> 09:15.709
Seems plenty gorked to me.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.218
- How old?
- 89.

09:17.445 --> 09:20.579
- What was his quality of life like?
- I'm calling his board-and-care.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.866
See if he's got a living will. I'll
avoid heroic measures if he's DNR.

09:25.066 --> 09:27.172
- I don't get a pulse.
- He's bradying down.

09:27.403 --> 09:30.088
- Are you getting through?
- They put me on hold.

09:34.447 --> 09:36.520
Let's bag him.
Break out the atropine.

09:38.385 --> 09:40.174
- This is ridiculous.
- It's a crime.

09:40.403 --> 09:42.925
Every surgical intern
is in the O.R. Today.

09:43.156 --> 09:43.919
Everyone but us.

09:44.148 --> 09:47.216
Benton let me spend more time
in the O.R. As a med student.

09:47.446 --> 09:48.876
Man, the man is a sadist!

09:49.111 --> 09:50.322
Look at this!

09:50.969 --> 09:52.398
Edson's double bypass?

09:52.633 --> 09:55.865
No, but jeez! No, Keaton.
That's Abby Keaton.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.778
Pediatric surgeon.
She used to be at Southside.

10:02.623 --> 10:03.518
- Oh, man!
- What?

10:03.776 --> 10:05.566
Benton will try for
an elective with her.

10:05.792 --> 10:08.183
No way. He signed up for
Thoracic with the new chief.

10:08.451 --> 10:11.714
Then why did I see him reading
<i>Essentials of Pediatric Surgery</i> ?

10:12.516 --> 10:13.663
Benton and kids?

10:13.894 --> 10:16.743
It's the most difficult specialty.
It is impossible to get into.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.594
It is exactly what he'd go for.

10:18.825 --> 10:22.122
I don't buy it.
Benton's no Mr. Rogers.

10:22.346 --> 10:25.316
It's a beautiful day in the
neighborhood, boys and girls.

10:25.549 --> 10:27.372
Gant, cover Med-surge today.

10:27.789 --> 10:30.890
I heard you signed up for a
Thoracic elective with Anspaugh.

10:31.119 --> 10:33.771
Carter, Pre-ops and Transfers for you.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.627
Any chance we'll get into the O.R.?

10:36.115 --> 10:37.009
Today?

10:37.459 --> 10:39.216
Maybe? Possibly?

10:39.444 --> 10:42.708
Call Surgery! Tell them
we've got a major chest impalement!

10:42.934 --> 10:45.172
- What happened?
- Motorcyclist hit a glass truck.

10:45.399 --> 10:47.768
Start an IV.
Set up the rapid infuser.

10:47.994 --> 10:49.139
Okay, let's move him.

10:49.498 --> 10:50.360
Ready...

10:50.971 --> 10:52.466
...and go.

10:53.115 --> 10:54.164
Watch out.

10:54.397 --> 10:56.307
- BP's 70.
- He's getting dusky.

10:56.542 --> 10:58.682
Try for a 16-gauge.
He needs more volume.

10:58.879 --> 11:00.473
He's seizing.
Someone hold his arm.

11:00.704 --> 11:02.941
Ativan 2.
Use both hands.

11:03.169 --> 11:04.959
- Get the needle in.
- He's moving.

11:05.219 --> 11:05.983
Wait, wait.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.676
- Do it.
- Now. Now!

11:08.965 --> 11:10.941
- Rapid infuse O-neg.
- No breath sounds.

11:11.206 --> 11:11.969
Tension pneumo.

11:12.199 --> 11:14.950
Damn! Connie, hold his head.

11:15.272 --> 11:17.543
Grab hold of this glass.
Watch your hands.

11:18.923 --> 11:20.680
Pulse ox is down to 70.

11:22.604 --> 11:23.402
Get over here now.

11:24.269 --> 11:25.066
I'll get someone.

11:28.528 --> 11:29.936
- They need you.
- I'm going to the lab.

11:30.161 --> 11:31.535
I'll take them. Go.

11:31.953 --> 11:32.783
Go!

11:43.032 --> 11:44.375
Do you pluck your eyebrows?

11:45.306 --> 11:46.234
Wax.

11:46.810 --> 11:48.272
They look good.
You do it yourself?

11:48.507 --> 11:50.713
No, I found this great
place on Dearborn.

11:50.940 --> 11:51.923
Time?

11:52.350 --> 11:53.693
Twelve minutes.

11:54.239 --> 11:56.411
- More epi?
- I guess.

11:57.152 --> 11:58.463
What's going on in there?

11:59.426 --> 12:01.216
They found medical records but no DNR.

12:01.442 --> 12:03.037
- Let's hear it.
- He's got...

12:03.235 --> 12:06.139
...COPD, renal failure,
congestive heart failure...

12:06.374 --> 12:08.065
...prostate cancer, diabetes...

12:08.294 --> 12:11.144
- Any family?
- A son. They're trying to reach him.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.751
If I ever get this old, I want "Do Not
Resuscitate" tattooed on my forehead.

12:15.210 --> 12:18.027
Get this. His pH is 6.97.

12:18.285 --> 12:20.293
All right.
He's been down long enough.

12:20.525 --> 12:22.119
Time of death: 10:06.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.245
Get a strip.

12:23.471 --> 12:25.032
I'm going next door.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.601
Mark, he's got a rhythm.

12:32.212 --> 12:33.522
It won't last.

12:34.005 --> 12:35.118
BP's 50 palp.

12:35.510 --> 12:37.683
Guess we better put him
back on the mask.

12:37.911 --> 12:39.318
Tough old geezer, ain't he?

12:43.259 --> 12:44.853
So she asked you to come to Hawaii?

12:45.115 --> 12:47.987
- But I don't know what she meant.
- It seems unambiguous.

12:48.253 --> 12:51.965
If she meant it as a friend, that
means separate hotel rooms, right?

12:52.192 --> 12:53.981
- Or you could be sharing a bed.
- Right.

12:54.209 --> 12:56.828
Get adjoining rooms with a broken lock
and see what happens.

12:57.059 --> 12:59.002
- You're not helping.
- What do you think she meant?

12:59.236 --> 13:01.441
Something a little more
than friendship.

13:01.668 --> 13:04.058
How do you feel about that?
Are you interested?

13:04.294 --> 13:05.789
- Maybe.
- Get on a plane, Humphrey.

13:06.023 --> 13:07.650
What if that's not what she meant?

13:07.848 --> 13:12.161
Three hours divided by seven patients
is 2.33. How's it going, Mark?

13:12.395 --> 13:14.818
Three hours, one patient.
I'm on a roll.

13:15.085 --> 13:18.120
- I'll take that plantar wart in 5.
- You got it.

13:18.510 --> 13:20.267
The neuro come down for Mr. Johnson?

13:20.496 --> 13:22.351
- Who?
- That gomer that came back to life.

13:22.577 --> 13:25.230
They wouldn't take him.
They said he's a renal case.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.631
Try Renal.
We gotta get him out of here.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.446
<i>- Jawohl</i>. Hey, your wart!
- Oh, right. Thank you.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.955
Can I have some more soup?

13:32.247 --> 13:34.386
- Whose patient is Johnson?
- Why?

13:34.616 --> 13:36.624
He stopped breathing.
They need you in 2.

13:36.856 --> 13:38.745
I'll take it. Anyone see Jeanie?

13:38.938 --> 13:40.280
She went on break.

13:40.507 --> 13:41.936
- More soup?
- Quiet.

13:42.171 --> 13:44.661
<i>- Sighting of a kangaroo</i>
<i>in Humboldt Park.</i>

13:45.182 --> 13:45.978
Come here.

13:46.239 --> 13:50.583
<i>The mystery marsupial was sighted</i>
<i>hopping along the Kennedy Expressway.</i>

13:50.849 --> 13:53.851
<i>The Department of Animal Control</i>
<i>is warning that kangaroos...</i>

13:54.083 --> 13:56.899
<i>... can be dangerous and</i>
<i>can attack when threatened.</i>

13:57.124 --> 13:58.052
Soup?

13:58.886 --> 14:01.790
So you asked him to go with you?

14:02.791 --> 14:04.386
It just popped out.

14:05.225 --> 14:06.502
Have you guys ever...?

14:07.306 --> 14:08.234
No!

14:10.892 --> 14:13.894
But you asked him to go to Hawaii.
That's pretty bold.

14:14.126 --> 14:18.471
It's stupid. I mean, Mark and I
are friends. We work together.

14:18.737 --> 14:21.357
And I basically invited him
into my bed!

14:21.779 --> 14:22.673
What did he say?

14:23.155 --> 14:26.289
He was appalled.
He couldn't wait to get away from me.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.084
I'm such a fool.

14:30.072 --> 14:31.666
How long is Anspaugh gonna be?

14:32.312 --> 14:33.589
One never knows.

14:33.849 --> 14:34.798
Dr. Benton?

14:35.418 --> 14:36.564
What are you doing here?

14:36.795 --> 14:39.414
I admitted a woman with a lipoma.
She needs surgery.

14:39.644 --> 14:41.784
- A fat tumor? It can wait.
- She wants it out today.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.317
All right. Well, then go ahead
and book an O.R.

14:45.407 --> 14:47.547
Can I assist, please?

14:47.778 --> 14:49.633
Yeah, whatever.
Just get out of here.

14:50.756 --> 14:51.487
Solid.

15:00.457 --> 15:03.874
This guy in the picture
with Dr. Anspaugh, is that...?

15:04.107 --> 15:05.734
General Schwarzkopf.

15:05.963 --> 15:07.820
They were roommates at West Point.

15:08.846 --> 15:10.887
Judith, I'll be in Neonatal.

15:11.502 --> 15:15.018
Dr. Anspaugh, I chose Cardiothoracic
as my eight-week elective.

15:15.217 --> 15:17.771
Congratulations!
That puts you on my team.

15:18.002 --> 15:20.142
But I just found out
Dr. Keaton's coming here.

15:20.372 --> 15:22.162
Yes. Very, very happy to have her.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.276
Yes, I know. I follow her work.

15:24.886 --> 15:26.895
Do I sense a wind shift, Doctor...?

15:27.160 --> 15:30.293
Benton. Dr. Keaton is one
of the finest pediatric surgeons.

15:30.521 --> 15:31.897
An opportunity to work with her...

15:32.122 --> 15:35.506
- She may not have a slot for you.
- Well, I'd like to see.

15:35.741 --> 15:37.629
I'll give you until 6:00.

15:38.301 --> 15:41.271
If I don't get the Pedes,
I'm still on for Thoracic?

15:41.504 --> 15:45.117
If I don't hear from you
by 6:00, you get neither.

15:47.395 --> 15:50.178
Jane, I'm Dr. Ross.
This is Dr. Doyle.

15:51.526 --> 15:54.561
I understand you've been
having pain when you urinate?

15:54.823 --> 15:57.956
I think it's a bladder infection.
I had one before.

15:59.178 --> 16:00.935
- When was that?
- Last year.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.335
Any soreness or tenderness?

16:04.268 --> 16:05.960
Just when I go to the bathroom.

16:06.478 --> 16:07.755
Are you sexually active?

16:09.071 --> 16:11.079
- Have you ever had intercourse?
- Oh, no.

16:11.633 --> 16:15.280
We'll do some tests. When we get
those back, we'll talk some more.

16:16.115 --> 16:16.912
All right.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.895
- What do you think?
- Either an STD, or she's pregnant.

16:23.127 --> 16:24.721
- Based on?
- Her sweater.

16:24.952 --> 16:27.921
Cashmere, probably Neiman Marcus.
A rich girl at a county ER?

16:28.186 --> 16:29.911
She doesn't want her family to know.

16:30.139 --> 16:31.155
So what do you do?

16:31.420 --> 16:33.331
Dip a urine and do a pregnancy test.

16:33.597 --> 16:34.775
Sounds good.

16:36.416 --> 16:38.173
Sorry, the O.R. S are booked.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.395
- Dr. Benton sends his apologies...
- He can send flowers for all I care.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.345
You've got a breast reconstruction
and a thyroidectomy ahead of you.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.745
- This is important.
- What is it?

16:48.551 --> 16:50.177
It's a pheochromocytoma.

16:50.407 --> 16:52.612
- A pheo.
- Her BP is through the roof.

16:52.808 --> 16:55.297
If we don't go in soon,
she'll stroke out.

16:55.562 --> 16:59.110
Tell Dr. Benton he has his O.R.
And tell him I like tulips.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.940
If you have an explanation,
I'm listening.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.300
I'm sorry. I haven't been
feeling well. I got nauseous.

17:08.529 --> 17:11.826
If it interferes with your work,
you should let me know.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.328
It won't happen again.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.115
Everything else okay?

17:16.502 --> 17:17.931
Yeah. Everything's fine.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.819
How's Al?

17:20.249 --> 17:22.453
He's holding his own. It's difficult.

17:22.681 --> 17:23.541
I'm sure it is.

17:27.516 --> 17:28.377
Can I help you?

17:28.604 --> 17:30.973
- I need to see Dr. Keaton.
- You're too late.

17:31.198 --> 17:34.135
- The patient's still conscious.
- Come back in three hours.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.718
- I need to talk to her.
- You don't know Dr. Keaton very well.

17:37.986 --> 17:38.914
Just by reputation. Why?

17:39.170 --> 17:43.363
If you go in there now, the only words
she'll have for you are, "Get out."

17:45.382 --> 17:47.804
If I write a note,
will you see she gets it?

17:48.040 --> 17:50.245
I am not a secretary.
Leave it in her box.

17:54.475 --> 17:58.854
Mr. Johnson, your father was found
unconscious this morning.

17:59.054 --> 18:01.357
He has what we call
multisystem failure.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.902
Heart, lungs, kidneys. And he may
have suffered a stroke as well.

18:05.169 --> 18:08.554
- That's like Alzheimer's.
- No. But it's very serious.

18:09.268 --> 18:10.927
Did you ever talk with your father...

18:11.157 --> 18:14.006
...about whether he wanted to use
machines to keep him alive...

18:14.231 --> 18:15.442
...if his body were failing?

18:15.671 --> 18:16.653
Not a lot, no.

18:18.105 --> 18:19.153
Were you and he close?

18:19.866 --> 18:20.979
About a hundred miles.

18:21.755 --> 18:22.999
I live in Boone County.

18:23.356 --> 18:24.600
I smoke hams.

18:26.141 --> 18:27.735
Your father is very ill.

18:28.127 --> 18:29.917
In all likelihood...

18:30.143 --> 18:32.316
...he may never regain consciousness.

18:32.546 --> 18:36.770
Now, we can use a machine
to keep his body alive...

18:36.995 --> 18:40.674
...or we can give him medication
to take care of his pain...

18:40.901 --> 18:42.691
...and let nature take its course.

18:43.143 --> 18:46.014
As next of kin, it's your decision.

18:49.322 --> 18:50.306
What do you think?

18:51.724 --> 18:53.131
If it were my father...

18:54.317 --> 18:56.839
...I would try
to make him comfortable...

18:57.070 --> 18:58.183
...in his final moments.

18:58.416 --> 18:59.180
Okay.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.765
So I'll get somebody
to bring you the papers?

19:02.994 --> 19:04.075
You'll help him, right?

19:04.819 --> 19:06.413
- I'm sorry?
- You'll make him better.

19:08.278 --> 19:09.872
I'm not sure that we can.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.985
Just don't let him die, okay?

19:15.673 --> 19:18.195
Make the incision
below the costal margin.

19:18.427 --> 19:19.834
Straight across, 6 cm.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.993
Now, just like carpentry,
measure twice, cut once.

19:24.222 --> 19:24.986
Right.

19:25.215 --> 19:28.600
Benton, you should've told me
you were doing a pheo.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.168
Trying to keep all the
exotic ones to yourself?

19:31.363 --> 19:33.054
What? I'm doing a lipoma removal.

19:33.283 --> 19:36.700
It's on the board.
"Pheochromocytoma" in big red letters.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.593
Who the hell put it up there?

19:40.199 --> 19:41.444
That one.

19:48.973 --> 19:52.270
Hey, Carter! Simon's letting me
do an appy. I'm going in!

20:00.531 --> 20:03.380
No. It's called gonorrhea.
It's sexually transmitted.

20:03.573 --> 20:07.153
It is treatable.
But we have to do it right away.

20:07.383 --> 20:08.813
Are you gonna tell my parents?

20:09.048 --> 20:11.538
Whether you tell your parents
or not is up to you.

20:11.801 --> 20:15.545
I would tell the boy, or boys,
that you've had sex with.

20:15.772 --> 20:17.299
I only did it once.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.543
Well, you need to tell him.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.689
I can't.

20:21.919 --> 20:22.716
Why is that?

20:23.552 --> 20:25.790
Because he won't talk to me.

20:28.835 --> 20:31.803
When I see him in the halls,
he won't even look at me.

20:33.350 --> 20:35.423
I feel really disgusting.

20:37.512 --> 20:38.495
Sorry.

20:40.586 --> 20:41.601
That's all right.

20:42.155 --> 20:44.010
I wanted it to be special.

20:45.229 --> 20:47.401
And it was like I wasn't even there.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.856
He didn't even drive me home.

20:51.888 --> 20:54.410
Guys who are interested
in having sex with you...

20:54.738 --> 20:57.456
...aren't necessarily interested
in you, you know?

20:59.445 --> 21:03.571
If you want it to be special, you'll
have to wait for the right guy.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.580
I would suggest waiting a long time.

21:07.961 --> 21:09.271
Like until you can vote.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.130
So Mr. Johnson's in V-tach.

21:14.397 --> 21:15.194
Paddles?

21:15.805 --> 21:16.700
Why not?

21:17.279 --> 21:18.108
Charge?

21:18.335 --> 21:19.099
You pick.

21:19.327 --> 21:20.221
Two hundred?

21:20.577 --> 21:21.952
Two hundred, it is.

21:22.529 --> 21:23.642
- Clear!
- Clear.

21:24.835 --> 21:26.779
- Next contestant. Do I hear 300?
- Sure.

21:27.012 --> 21:29.402
Three hundred from the woman
in the floral scrubs.

21:29.797 --> 21:31.008
- Clear.
- Clear.

21:31.687 --> 21:34.722
I'll see your 300 and raise you 360.

21:38.058 --> 21:38.888
What a joke.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.513
- 360.
- Clear!

21:43.341 --> 21:45.579
And he's back. What a trouper!

21:45.838 --> 21:50.184
Congratulations! You are the lucky
winner of a brand-new ventilator...

21:50.450 --> 21:53.004
...at a cost of $5000 a day...

21:53.236 --> 21:56.019
...and as a bonus,
your very own chest x-ray...

21:56.245 --> 21:59.213
...perfect for decorating the small,
sterile hospital room...

21:59.447 --> 22:02.831
...where you'll spend the rest
of your brief, unconscious life.

22:13.919 --> 22:15.381
She's still in there?
It's 4:00.

22:15.616 --> 22:19.033
She went back in. She's got
a 4-year-old with a Wilms' tumor.

22:19.298 --> 22:22.649
- Excuse me. What are you doing?
- I'm just seeing if she got my note.

22:26.982 --> 22:29.504
Look, when Dr. Keaton
comes out, please...

22:29.736 --> 22:31.909
...please make sure
that she gets this.

22:32.778 --> 22:37.287
I'm Peter Benton. I'm interested
in a Pediatric Surgery elective.

22:37.516 --> 22:39.656
I need to talk to her by 6:00.
My pager is...

22:39.885 --> 22:41.544
- 3376. I can read!

22:43.055 --> 22:45.609
Look, just make sure
she gets it, okay?

22:50.868 --> 22:52.330
You always vomit when you screw up?

22:52.598 --> 22:55.184
Only when I get written up
by the chief of staff.

22:55.414 --> 22:59.574
Ten mgs of Compazine should get
your stomach back on its feet.

22:59.897 --> 23:02.419
- You missed a great appendectomy.
- I could lose my Residency.

23:02.650 --> 23:05.271
Retracted the internal oblique,
clamped that sucker.

23:05.499 --> 23:06.612
My career is over.

23:08.894 --> 23:09.974
Sorry. Sorry.

23:13.281 --> 23:15.769
You assisted on a surgery
behind my back?

23:15.970 --> 23:17.858
- Simon needed an intern.
- I'm your Resident.

23:18.083 --> 23:21.401
You don't blink without asking me.
You're on bedsore duty.

23:21.637 --> 23:23.264
If there's a boil, you lance it.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.430
If there's a weeping decubitus,
you d Ábride it. And if...

23:28.041 --> 23:31.108
Anspaugh's leading chief rounds
in 20 minutes. Don't be late.

23:31.338 --> 23:33.893
Especially you, Carter.
He asked for you by name.

23:37.231 --> 23:39.336
I can't believe I spent
four years in med school...

23:39.567 --> 23:41.772
...to take orders from a guy
who smokes hams.

23:42.001 --> 23:44.719
- Other than that, how's your day?
- Just got worse.

23:44.946 --> 23:47.315
- Who does this belong to?
- That's mine.

23:47.507 --> 23:50.192
Wear it.
We lose 20 or 30 a year.

23:50.935 --> 23:52.790
Who invented the stethoscope?

23:53.079 --> 23:54.127
I have no idea.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.215
Ren Á La Çnnec, 1819.

23:56.441 --> 23:58.198
You can see I taught her well.

23:58.426 --> 24:02.225
Keep hustling, boys. You don't
wanna end up with the Turtle Wax.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.884
- I haven't seen you much today.
- It's been a pretty busy one.

24:10.497 --> 24:11.675
So you've been...

24:12.290 --> 24:13.272
...busy.

24:13.666 --> 24:14.747
Yeah. Pretty much.

24:16.228 --> 24:18.084
So about Hawaii.

24:18.949 --> 24:20.260
How much are the hotel rooms?

24:20.455 --> 24:21.219
Rooms?

24:21.768 --> 24:22.564
Or a room.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.517
For me.

24:26.282 --> 24:27.843
I'll have to check on that.

24:28.107 --> 24:29.285
You let me know.

24:29.804 --> 24:30.633
Sure.

24:31.181 --> 24:34.412
Here! Turn on Channel 5 quickly.
They spotted him again.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.772
He was at the rail yard an hour ago.
I hope he made it through.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.334
<i>That kangaroo watch continues.</i>

24:40.562 --> 24:43.149
<i>The kangaroo that mysteriously</i>
<i>appeared on Chicago streets...</i>

24:43.379 --> 24:47.124
<i>... entered this abandoned building</i>
<i>at the corner of Kensey and Maplewood.</i>

24:47.350 --> 24:48.977
That's six blocks from my house!

24:49.207 --> 24:52.558
<i>Armed Fish and Wildlife officers</i>
<i>have surrounded the building...</i>

24:52.762 --> 24:55.763
<i>...in an attempt to apprehend him.</i>
- They won't shoot him?

24:55.995 --> 24:58.844
I hope so. That thing
looks like a giant rat.

25:02.142 --> 25:03.004
You paged me?

25:05.120 --> 25:06.168
Where's the patient?

25:06.401 --> 25:08.507
There is no patient. We need to talk.

25:09.058 --> 25:11.263
- About what?
- About my working here.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.526
Are you planning to tell
anyone that I'm positive?

25:14.758 --> 25:15.554
No, I'm not.

25:16.871 --> 25:18.945
I don't agree
with what you're doing...

25:20.905 --> 25:24.355
...but how you handle your patients,
that's your responsibility.

25:26.668 --> 25:27.749
Thank you.

25:27.981 --> 25:29.771
But stay away from my patients.

25:29.998 --> 25:32.520
And I don't wanna be
in a trauma room with you.

25:39.155 --> 25:41.907
That girl had her ceftriaxone.
Should I write a scrip?

25:42.133 --> 25:45.615
Ten days of doxycycline. And tell her
to stay away from insincere suitors.

25:45.847 --> 25:46.994
You were good with her.

25:47.384 --> 25:48.400
Thanks.

25:50.778 --> 25:53.267
Listen, why don't you grab some lunch?

25:53.499 --> 25:56.567
I was on all night.
I'm gonna sack out for about an hour.

25:56.766 --> 25:59.670
- I'll round you up when I get back.
- That's not necessary.

26:03.969 --> 26:06.458
Susan, can you push some ketorolac?

26:06.724 --> 26:08.317
Actually, I'm suturing a thumb.

26:08.549 --> 26:11.038
- Do you know where Mark is?
- Try the desk.

26:11.526 --> 26:12.868
Have you seen Doug?

26:13.095 --> 26:13.957
Haven't seen him.

26:14.856 --> 26:16.384
Where are all the doctors?

26:23.277 --> 26:24.171
Are you available?

26:24.397 --> 26:25.346
Sure.

26:26.478 --> 26:27.427
Exam 1.

26:27.887 --> 26:28.836
In a minute.

26:32.017 --> 26:34.954
Next, we have a 73-year-old...

26:35.219 --> 26:38.036
...postthyroidectomy,
exhibiting both Chvostek's...

26:38.262 --> 26:40.237
...and Trousseau's signs.

26:40.503 --> 26:41.365
Treatment?

26:41.816 --> 26:42.961
Dr. Carter?

26:44.761 --> 26:46.703
Saline diuresis...

26:46.938 --> 26:49.274
...three to six liters per day,
plus pamidronate.

26:49.499 --> 26:52.219
Textbook treatment for hypercalcemia.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.480
Unfortunately, this patient
has hypocalcemia...

26:55.711 --> 26:57.600
...and you've just stopped his heart.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.582
Rest in peace, Mr. Edmonson.

26:59.777 --> 27:00.890
Next we have a...

27:01.122 --> 27:02.912
Man, he's gunning for you.

27:03.780 --> 27:04.641
Are you okay?

27:04.965 --> 27:06.853
I can't control the muscles
in my neck.

27:07.110 --> 27:08.965
You're having a reaction
to the Compazine.

27:09.222 --> 27:12.290
- I am?
- Muscle spasms are a side effect.

27:12.969 --> 27:14.857
- So is lip-smacking.
- Help me!

27:15.531 --> 27:18.150
The aortography on this patient
revealed a small...

27:18.380 --> 27:21.448
...type A dissection
of the thoracic aorta.

27:21.677 --> 27:22.922
Dr. Carter...

27:23.279 --> 27:25.002
...differentiate between type A...

27:25.649 --> 27:28.814
...and type B aortic dissection.

27:30.483 --> 27:34.162
Type A involves the ascending aorta
and type B the descending.

27:36.374 --> 27:37.389
Correct.

27:37.719 --> 27:39.825
Next, a traumatic amputation.

27:40.089 --> 27:44.018
The patient is a 35-year-old female
in good health, presented in our...

27:44.283 --> 27:45.909
How much longer do I have to wait?

27:46.139 --> 27:47.995
They're prepping an O.R. For you now.

27:48.253 --> 27:50.293
In two hours you will be stone-free.

27:50.525 --> 27:52.862
I have some questions for the doctor.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.286
The surgeon will be down
to answer your questions.

27:56.674 --> 27:57.722
I'll be right back.

27:58.499 --> 28:00.834
I'd give him saline
instead of painkiller.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.363
- Why?
- He flunked me in chemistry.

28:03.558 --> 28:05.632
- You went to St. Mona's?
- Yeah. You?

28:05.863 --> 28:08.548
I think you were in my history class.
Mrs. Hester.

28:08.776 --> 28:11.233
Never had her.
You might be thinking of my sister.

28:11.498 --> 28:13.092
- What year were you?
- '88.

28:13.355 --> 28:14.763
Oh. See, I was '85.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.160
Mary's three years older than me.

28:17.710 --> 28:21.127
Check Sidowski's urine output.
The last entry was two hours ago.

28:25.073 --> 28:28.556
Animal Control cop got shot with a
tranquilizer. Where do you want him?

28:28.788 --> 28:29.967
Exam 4.

28:30.837 --> 28:32.692
Excuse me, officer.
How did this happen?

28:32.918 --> 28:35.571
I was trying to hit that kangaroo
that's running around.

28:35.768 --> 28:37.908
- My partner got in the way.
- And the kangaroo?

28:38.137 --> 28:40.440
Hopped a wall. He's still out there.

28:46.654 --> 28:47.767
- Recognize this?
- What?

28:48.031 --> 28:50.104
This was found at your father's
nursing home.

28:50.336 --> 28:51.481
It's a living will.

28:51.712 --> 28:55.992
It says your father didn't want heroic
measures used to prolong his life.

28:56.227 --> 28:57.690
A will? What did I get?

28:58.885 --> 29:01.505
It means we never should've
put him on the ventilator.

29:01.735 --> 29:04.606
We've kept him alive against
his expressed wishes.

29:05.481 --> 29:06.277
See this?

29:07.946 --> 29:10.314
Right here? Does that
signature look familiar?

29:10.604 --> 29:11.618
Yeah, that's mine.

29:11.852 --> 29:13.130
Yes, it is.

29:17.872 --> 29:19.782
I gotta go put the hams to bed.

29:24.788 --> 29:26.195
Except this one.

29:28.726 --> 29:29.839
This one's for you.

29:30.455 --> 29:32.693
So you'll call me
when he wakes up, right?

29:35.610 --> 29:36.472
My work number.

29:39.388 --> 29:40.567
Bye, Pop!

29:43.165 --> 29:45.371
- What happened?
- 30-foot fall off a beam.

29:45.632 --> 29:47.837
Head trauma.
Near amputation of the left leg.

29:48.097 --> 29:49.440
- I'll get some O-neg.
- Eight units.

29:49.666 --> 29:51.554
And call the reimplantation team.

29:51.811 --> 29:53.153
Let's go! Trauma 2!

29:53.379 --> 29:54.274
Let's go!

30:00.456 --> 30:02.945
Jane wanted to say goodbye.

30:03.306 --> 30:05.795
Thanks for helping me.
You've both been really nice.

30:06.027 --> 30:08.996
Well, okay. Be careful out there.

30:10.126 --> 30:11.403
You need to get that?

30:12.463 --> 30:13.511
Excuse me.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.185
Faint dorsalis pulse.

30:22.452 --> 30:25.683
Decreased breath sounds on the right.
Set up for a chest tube.

30:26.838 --> 30:27.821
All right.

30:28.985 --> 30:29.845
What's going on?

30:30.073 --> 30:33.719
Thirty-foot high dive, facial trauma,
open fractures, tension pneumo.

30:33.947 --> 30:35.891
- He's not breathing.
- Laryngoscope, now!

30:36.125 --> 30:37.467
Lacerated femoral artery.

30:37.693 --> 30:39.833
A vascular clamp for suction.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.294
Can't visualize the cord.
Too much blood.

30:42.527 --> 30:43.870
- From where?
- I don't know.

30:44.065 --> 30:45.342
Looks like the nasopharynx.

30:46.017 --> 30:47.262
Jeanie can pack the nose.

30:47.970 --> 30:51.770
Get a 16 Foley and an umbilical clamp.
Peter can talk you through it.

30:52.037 --> 30:54.821
- You were gonna stay out of my traumas.
- I was here first.

30:55.047 --> 30:57.569
- Pulse ox is dropping, 78.
- Come on. Let's go.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.940
Try the catheters through the nose.
Let's move.

31:00.842 --> 31:02.184
Can you visualize the balloon?

31:02.795 --> 31:05.317
- It's down there.
- Inflate and retract.

31:06.574 --> 31:07.501
Artery's clamped.

31:07.726 --> 31:09.702
- Can you take over for Jeanie?
- She's got it.

31:10.096 --> 31:13.065
- I think I've got it sealed.
- Clamp it to keep it in place.

31:13.874 --> 31:15.119
- It's clamped.
- Peter?

31:15.699 --> 31:16.780
Bleeding's stopped.

31:17.493 --> 31:19.053
He's tubed. Bag him.

31:19.285 --> 31:20.146
Nice job, guys.

31:20.374 --> 31:23.026
- Good breath sounds.
- Let's get him upstairs. Move!

31:27.450 --> 31:28.279
Good work.

31:28.826 --> 31:29.687
Thanks.

31:35.839 --> 31:36.984
What kind of greens?

31:38.464 --> 31:41.117
Romaine, spinach, alfalfa.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.135
- Right.
- Who's he talking to?

31:43.363 --> 31:44.640
Australian Embassy.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.395
There was some confusion.

31:46.597 --> 31:49.249
We intubated him first,
and then we found the DNR.

31:49.478 --> 31:51.040
Yes, I know. But...

31:51.687 --> 31:54.209
He never should've been put
on the ventilator.

31:54.473 --> 31:56.863
I just need the legal okay
to take him off.

31:58.058 --> 31:59.007
Absolutely.

31:59.563 --> 32:01.091
His pulse ox barely registers.

32:01.357 --> 32:04.806
There's not a single functioning
organ left in his body.

32:05.263 --> 32:07.119
He's got one foot in the grave.
This man...

32:07.343 --> 32:08.555
Is awake.

32:10.130 --> 32:11.407
I'll call you right back.

32:15.252 --> 32:18.123
Mr. Johnson, do you know
where you are?

32:20.120 --> 32:21.331
You're very sick.

32:21.592 --> 32:24.726
You were found unconscious
at your home. Do you understand?

32:26.267 --> 32:28.635
You want me to take
that tube out of your mouth?

32:32.511 --> 32:36.223
There is a risk of respiratory failure
if we take you off the ventilator.

32:37.922 --> 32:39.897
Are you sure that
that's what you want?

32:43.236 --> 32:44.000
All right.

32:44.646 --> 32:48.805
What I want you to do is to blow
real hard on the count of three.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.487
One, two...

32:51.689 --> 32:53.512
...three. Blow.

32:56.364 --> 32:57.674
Good. Good.

32:59.341 --> 33:00.870
Are you okay, Mr. Johnson?

33:02.768 --> 33:04.427
Call me Jack.

33:07.249 --> 33:10.219
The Compazine wore off.
Now I'm sick to my stomach again.

33:10.452 --> 33:13.203
- What a day.
- I just wanna go home and go to bed.

33:13.429 --> 33:15.154
How much longer
do we put up with this?

33:15.383 --> 33:16.845
- With what?
- With Benton.

33:17.848 --> 33:21.779
- What else are we gonna do?
- I can't take this abuse for a year.

33:22.555 --> 33:23.319
Betty?

33:23.996 --> 33:25.044
What happened?

33:28.062 --> 33:29.819
Smoke inhalation.

33:30.079 --> 33:31.455
There was a fire?

33:32.128 --> 33:32.990
Was anybody hurt?

33:34.049 --> 33:36.505
- Just me.
- What about your apartment?

33:38.276 --> 33:39.389
It's gone.

33:40.133 --> 33:41.890
- Everything.
- Everything.

33:42.471 --> 33:44.031
The whole building.

33:44.648 --> 33:45.990
The whole building?

33:47.689 --> 33:48.738
My floor too?

33:56.431 --> 33:57.446
She's not here.

33:57.678 --> 33:59.054
I think she went home.

34:03.058 --> 34:03.790
Damn!

34:04.051 --> 34:07.401
So there he was, naked as a jaybird.

34:07.732 --> 34:10.121
I mean, not a stitch.

34:11.286 --> 34:12.181
So I said:

34:13.047 --> 34:15.896
"Son, what the hell are you doing?"

34:16.954 --> 34:19.443
He turns, looks straight at me
and says:

34:20.764 --> 34:22.072
"Fishing, Pop.

34:23.326 --> 34:24.155
Fishing."

34:25.695 --> 34:27.157
He's a sweet boy.

34:27.775 --> 34:28.889
Just...

34:29.409 --> 34:30.303
...slow.

34:31.010 --> 34:32.572
You want me to call him?

34:34.244 --> 34:35.771
I don't like him driving at night.

34:36.837 --> 34:40.996
We'll transfer you to Intensive Care.
They'll make sure you're comfortable.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.842
Is there anything else I can do?

34:46.090 --> 34:47.650
I had a good spin.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.916
Saw two wars...

34:51.790 --> 34:53.165
...10 Chevys.

34:55.054 --> 34:56.103
Boston...

34:56.784 --> 34:58.127
...San Francisco...

34:58.514 --> 34:59.976
...Paris, France.

35:02.388 --> 35:03.533
Married a woman...

35:04.469 --> 35:05.877
...who put up with me...

35:06.582 --> 35:09.933
...and died as beautiful
as the day we met.

35:11.481 --> 35:12.975
You can't ask for more.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.788
- Is Dr. Anspaugh here?
- He's not here.

35:22.015 --> 35:25.847
- He was supposed to be here at 6:00.
- He left about five minutes ago.

35:26.593 --> 35:28.896
Listen, do you have his pager number?

35:29.699 --> 35:30.812
Sorry. I'm new here.

35:31.204 --> 35:32.798
Yeah, beautiful.
Thank you.

35:35.238 --> 35:36.962
You're Benton, aren't you?

35:37.832 --> 35:38.913
Abby Keaton.

35:39.176 --> 35:41.447
I'd shake your hand,
but I've got pepperoni on mine.

35:42.091 --> 35:44.426
Don's letting me use his computer
till I move over.

35:46.541 --> 35:47.305
Well, it's...

35:48.750 --> 35:49.732
I'm sorry.

35:51.952 --> 35:53.415
It's a pleasure to meet you.

35:53.649 --> 35:58.191
Actually, I've been trying
to get in touch with you all day.

35:58.420 --> 35:59.369
I got your note.

35:59.604 --> 36:02.868
So you're interested
in Pediatric Surgery.

36:03.062 --> 36:04.623
Yes, I am. Very much.

36:06.552 --> 36:09.271
How do you feel about deep-dish
pepperoni and anchovies?

36:09.658 --> 36:12.048
Well, I don't eat meat but, hey...

36:12.315 --> 36:13.690
You could scrape it off.

36:14.429 --> 36:15.356
Sit down.

36:16.189 --> 36:17.118
Let's talk.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.041
Gee, it's cold out tonight.

36:22.721 --> 36:24.479
Yeah. It feels like fall.

36:24.899 --> 36:25.848
You off?

36:26.724 --> 36:28.415
Waiting for a break in the rain.

36:31.526 --> 36:34.757
How long have you and Al
been separated?

36:34.952 --> 36:36.163
Almost a year.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.813
No chance of a reconciliation?

36:41.997 --> 36:45.676
Must be tough to be sick and alone.

36:48.464 --> 36:51.433
Good friend of mine
tested positive last year.

36:52.402 --> 36:55.087
I think I'm one of
the two people he's told.

36:55.572 --> 36:57.427
He's a lawyer.

36:59.253 --> 37:01.077
Didn't wanna tell his coworkers.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.793
He's afraid he might lose clients.

37:06.554 --> 37:09.141
It's gotta be hard
to carry that around all day.

37:15.551 --> 37:16.348
It is.

37:26.342 --> 37:29.246
I'm glad you decided to keep working.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.822
It'd be a real loss
to the patients if you quit.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.442
Is there anything you need?

37:38.636 --> 37:40.012
No. I'm okay.

37:41.005 --> 37:42.021
Okay.

37:45.329 --> 37:46.889
It's freezing out here.

37:48.626 --> 37:49.739
Well, good night.

37:57.624 --> 37:58.573
Wait.

37:58.808 --> 38:00.085
Are you serious?

38:01.626 --> 38:05.010
I've given it a lot of thought,
and I've decided to be spontaneous.

38:05.244 --> 38:07.962
- What the hell? I'm going to Maui.
- Good for you.

38:08.189 --> 38:09.303
I'm not misreading her?

38:09.534 --> 38:13.180
You don't invite somebody to Maui
to play Scrabble by the pool.

38:13.761 --> 38:14.841
How's that new intern?

38:15.074 --> 38:17.049
Doyle? She's fine.
Competent, does her job.

38:17.283 --> 38:18.177
Keep her?

38:18.435 --> 38:20.159
Sure, keep her. Why not?

38:21.733 --> 38:22.814
I need your signature.

38:23.078 --> 38:25.893
More paperwork.
Mr. Johnson, surprise, surprise.

38:26.119 --> 38:27.975
- Transfer orders?
- Death certificate.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.241
- What?
- He arrested in the elevator.

38:30.474 --> 38:34.120
ICU never admitted him.
So technically, he's still your patient.

38:37.870 --> 38:39.781
Hey, that's my locker!

38:40.400 --> 38:41.164
Got you!

38:42.641 --> 38:44.617
Get back to the neighborhood much?

38:44.851 --> 38:47.154
Every night.
I still live with my parents.

38:47.507 --> 38:48.337
Really?

38:49.204 --> 38:51.988
Same room I shared with my sisters.
I'm saving money.

38:52.214 --> 38:53.524
You could sell the Beemer.

38:53.783 --> 38:56.436
That was a gift.
My dad bought it at a police auction.

38:56.665 --> 38:58.389
- Oh, he's a cop.
- Third generation.

38:58.617 --> 39:01.969
He wanted me to be the first female
commissioner, but I took after my mom.

39:02.203 --> 39:04.115
- Oh, she's a doctor.
- Nurse.

39:04.413 --> 39:07.197
What I was gonna be until I got
kicked out of nursing school.

39:07.807 --> 39:09.718
I never was good at taking orders.

39:10.465 --> 39:11.610
See you.

39:20.966 --> 39:23.390
I don't want that thing
eating out of my mixing bowl.

39:23.656 --> 39:26.079
Ma, I'll clean it when I'm done!

39:32.014 --> 39:33.355
<i>Lewis.</i>

39:33.582 --> 39:34.728
Weaver.

39:34.991 --> 39:35.919
Weaver.

39:36.528 --> 39:37.455
Ross.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.445
Lewis.

39:38.673 --> 39:39.600
Greene?

39:40.338 --> 39:41.265
You work today?

39:43.924 --> 39:44.873
This it?

39:46.997 --> 39:49.781
You worked a 12-hour shift,
and you saw only one patient?

39:50.008 --> 39:51.634
It was unusually time-consuming.

39:51.864 --> 39:53.207
What was the outcome?

39:53.433 --> 39:54.295
He died.

39:55.514 --> 39:58.516
On the other end of the scale,
looks like we have a tie...

39:58.780 --> 40:01.050
...between Dr. Lewis
and Dr. Weaver.

40:01.438 --> 40:03.414
Last patient out the door.

40:04.832 --> 40:07.223
Congratulations, doctor.

40:07.458 --> 40:09.346
You win the gumdrops.

40:12.100 --> 40:13.246
It's the...

40:13.925 --> 40:15.300
...black Cadillac Seville.

40:15.526 --> 40:17.893
Front row, burgundy interior.

40:22.058 --> 40:24.000
Don't forget the sidewalls.

40:26.156 --> 40:27.018
Is he serious?

40:31.759 --> 40:33.997
I wanna talk to you
about that invitation.

40:34.544 --> 40:35.527
I'm sorry about that.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.171
I hope you didn't misunderstand me.

40:40.403 --> 40:43.569
I mean, we can still get you a room
if you still wanna come.

40:44.918 --> 40:45.967
But you can't.
That's okay.

40:46.199 --> 40:48.534
I wasn't really serious
about it myself.

40:49.017 --> 40:49.847
Right.

40:53.979 --> 40:55.988
So I'll see you in 10 days.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.149
Sure.

40:57.886 --> 40:59.348
Don't worry about the cat.

40:59.615 --> 41:00.597
Thank you.

41:02.176 --> 41:03.551
Have a great trip.

41:04.130 --> 41:05.057
Call me.

41:06.274 --> 41:07.770
Yeah! From the pool.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.108
- Bye.
- Bye.
