01:42.603 --> 01:43.571
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.273
SO WHEN MY MA HOLLERED AT ME AND

01:45.273 --> 01:46.674
SAID SHE WANTED TO MEET UP, I

01:46.674 --> 01:49.177
SAID, "COOL, I'MA LISTEN, BUT IT

01:49.177 --> 01:50.844
AIN'T GONNA BE JUST ALL YOU.

01:50.844 --> 01:51.845
IT GONNA BE A TWO-SIDED

01:51.845 --> 01:53.514
CONVERSATION 'CAUSE I GOT MY

01:53.514 --> 01:54.682
OWN FEELINGS."

01:54.682 --> 01:55.749
IT'S LIKE I BEEN GOING

01:55.749 --> 01:56.417
THROUGH STUFF.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.851
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.953
I HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES AND ANGER

01:59.953 --> 02:00.754
IN ME.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.656
EVERYBODY HAVE THEY WAY THEY

02:02.656 --> 02:03.724
FEEL, AND THEY WANT TO GET IT

02:03.724 --> 02:04.392
OFF THEY CHEST.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.326
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS DEALT FOR.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.427
I MEAN, GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.195
BUT IN THE DAY?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.929
BUT DO IT RESPECTFUL, YOU

02:08.929 --> 02:09.597

02:11.465 --> 02:12.600
YOU WERE, AND I CAN'T GO AGAINST

02:12.600 --> 02:16.204
THAT, BUT WHEN YOU CHECK ME, SHE

02:16.204 --> 02:18.872
FELT LIKE IT WAS THE GATE OPEN

02:18.872 --> 02:20.474
TO, "I CAN GO IN ON HIS MAMA."

02:20.474 --> 02:21.375
YOU EVER SEEN THE TV SHOW

02:21.375 --> 02:22.042

02:25.813 --> 02:26.714
SO LET HER HAVE THAT.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.915
YOU KNOW, I LET HER HAVE THAT.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.483
SHE WENT HAM, BUT SHE DIDN'T

02:29.483 --> 02:31.118
CALL YOU OUT YOUR NAME.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.286
SO YOU GONNA HOLD ON 'CAUSE

02:32.286 --> 02:34.255
SHE DIDN'T CALL ME OUT MY NAME

02:34.255 --> 02:35.088
THAT SHE WAS IN RIGHT?

02:35.088 --> 02:36.557
I MEAN, SHE--I MEAN--

02:36.557 --> 02:37.458
DISRESPECT IS DISRESPECT ON

02:37.458 --> 02:38.226

02:42.396 --> 02:44.365
YEARS OF HER DOING IT TOO.

02:44.365 --> 02:47.000

02:47.000 --> 02:48.369
BUT SHE DOES IT FIRST, AND SHE

02:50.304 --> 02:51.104
SHE COME WITH IT--

02:51.104 --> 02:52.740
SHE'S A DISRESPECTFUL BITCH,

02:52.740 --> 02:53.441
SCRAPPY.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.107
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.582
LIKE, "OKAY, STEVIE, THIS IS A

05:14.582 --> 05:16.083
BUSINESS ASPECT.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.017

05:17.017 --> 05:17.885
RELATIONSHIP.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.420
WE'RE OUT IN PUBLIC."

05:19.420 --> 05:21.455
THE GROUNDING OF "PERSONAL, HERE

05:21.455 --> 05:23.424

05:25.292 --> 05:26.226
YOU KNOW, I TRY TO KEEP THE

05:26.226 --> 05:27.828

05:27.828 --> 05:29.162
WITH STEVIE, BUT IT REALLY DOES

05:29.162 --> 05:30.564
NOT WORK OUT, SO IT FEELS LIKE

05:30.564 --> 05:32.400
I'M IN A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.767
DEALING WITH THIS MAN IS DEALING

05:33.767 --> 05:35.603
WITH SOMETHING THAT IS THE

05:35.603 --> 05:37.270
UNUSUAL.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.205
IF I HAVE SEX WITH HIM, IT'S A

05:38.205 --> 05:39.507
PROBLEM, AND IF IT DON'T, IT'S

05:39.507 --> 05:41.241
ANOTHER PROBLEM, SO WHAT THE

05:41.241 --> 05:42.643
[bleep] CAN I DO?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.011
OH, GOSH, THIS IS SUCH A

DIFFICULT SITUATION.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.414
RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST, LIKE,

05:46.414 --> 05:47.280

05:48.416 --> 05:49.450
HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY 'CAUSE I

05:49.450 --> 05:51.552
THINK HE'S CRAZY.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.890

05:56.890 --> 05:58.191
I DON'T WANT NO JACK.

NOW THAT THINGS ARE BACK TO

05:58.992 --> 06:00.060

06:13.140 --> 06:14.475
BROKE HOT POCKET.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.142
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:15.142 --> 06:16.076
WHEN IT COMES TO SEX, YOU HAVE

06:16.076 --> 06:16.810
TO DRINK?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.512
PROBLEM IS, IT'S JUST THIS

06:18.512 --> 06:20.080
ONE DUDE.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.449
EVER SINCE I STOPPED TALKING TO

06:21.449 --> 06:23.517
MY LAST GUY, MY WHOO-HA HAS NOT

06:23.517 --> 06:24.552
BEEN THE SAME.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.686
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD

06:25.686 --> 06:27.588
GET IT BACK TO WORKING AND

06:27.588 --> 06:29.490
PUMPING AND DOING WHAT IT NEEDED

06:29.490 --> 06:31.291
TO DO, SO NOW WHEN I TRY TO DATE

06:31.291 --> 06:32.760
A GUY, I HAVE TO TAKE MY OTHER

06:32.760 --> 06:34.562
MAN, JACK DANIELS.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.064
THIS IS THE FIRST DUDE EVER THAT

06:37.064 --> 06:39.232
I HAVE GONE HARD FOR.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.300
GIRL, GET TO THE GOOD STUFF.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.469
QUIT PLAYING WITH THE ROMANCE

06:41.469 --> 06:42.135
AND ALL OF THAT.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.371
THE GOOD STUFF IS, HIS THING

06:44.371 --> 06:45.773
IS BIG, YOU KNOW?

06:45.773 --> 06:46.807
HE DONE SHUT HER DOWN.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.375
IT SAYS, "OUT OF ORDER."

06:48.375 --> 06:49.943
YOU GOT THAT YELLOW TAPE

06:49.943 --> 06:50.644
AROUND IT?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.345
SHE NEEDS REHAB.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.581
SO I'M GONNA GO TO MY DOCTOR,

06:53.581 --> 06:55.115
AND I'M GOING TO SEE WHY

06:55.115 --> 06:55.783
SHE'S BROKE.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.717
YOU SHOULD GO WITH ME.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.785
AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH

06:57.785 --> 06:58.719
THAT THANG.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.821
IT'S JUST YOU LIKE SOMEBODY, AND

07:00.821 --> 07:01.789
YOU WANT HIM BACK, AND THAT'S

07:01.789 --> 07:02.490
THE ISSUE.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.324
I NEED TO HEAR IT FROM A

07:04.324 --> 07:05.993
CERTIFIED PROFESSIONAL.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.662
I NEED HIM TO TELL ME THAT THIS

07:08.662 --> 07:10.664
THANG IS UP AND KICKING AND

07:10.664 --> 07:13.266
READY, AND I'M JUST WANTING THE

07:13.266 --> 07:14.167
OLD DUDE BACK.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.168

08:24.071 --> 08:25.072
PUT THE ICING ON THE CAKE.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.006
SHE'S A RAW PERSON.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.207
MY MAMA'S NOT GONNA LET NOBODY

08:27.207 --> 08:28.108
JUST TELL HER WHAT TO DO.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.409
WELL, I WANT TO PUMP THE

08:29.409 --> 08:30.744
BRAKES.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.645

08:36.483 --> 08:37.384

08:37.384 --> 08:38.051

08:39.252 --> 08:39.920
RELATIONSHIP--

08:39.920 --> 08:42.389
Y'ALL CAN KEEP THAT [bleep].

08:55.903 --> 08:57.104
EVERY TIME WE GET INTO A

08:57.104 --> 08:58.305
ARGUMENT AND IT GETS HEATED,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.007
SCRAPPY ASKS FOR HIS RING BACK,

09:00.007 --> 09:01.274
AND IT'S COOL.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.110
I CAN BLOW IT OFF, BUT I CAN'T

09:03.110 --> 09:04.678
ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU CHOSE

09:04.678 --> 09:06.780
YOUR MOTHER OVER ME.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.681
THE WHOLE DINNER SCENE JUST--

09:07.681 --> 09:09.750
IT JUST PUT THE ICING ON THE

09:09.750 --> 09:10.918
CAKE PRETTY MUCH.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.119
WE ALL CAN POINT FINGERS AND

09:12.119 --> 09:12.886
SAY, "OH, YOU WERE

09:12.886 --> 09:13.621
DISRESPECTFUL.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.287
YOU WERE DISRESPECTFUL."

09:14.287 --> 09:15.488
BUT WE ALL COULD HAVE HANDLED IT

09:15.488 --> 09:16.189
DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW WHAT

09:16.189 --> 09:16.857
I'M SAYING?

09:16.857 --> 09:17.625
WE ALL COULD HAVE HANDLED IT

09:17.625 --> 09:18.291
DIFFERENT.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.126
WE ALL COULD HAVE HANDLED IT

09:19.126 --> 09:19.793
DIFFERENT.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.894
BUT, IN THE SAME BREATH,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.162
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT

09:22.162 --> 09:23.496
POINTING A FINGER.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.464
IT'S TRYING TO CLEAR

09:24.464 --> 09:25.799
THE AIR OF A SITUATION

09:25.799 --> 09:27.134
THAT HAS BEEN CONTINUED AND

09:27.134 --> 09:28.335
DISRESPECTFUL THAT'S GOING ON

09:28.335 --> 09:29.536
FOR TEN YEARS.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.337
AND WE SUPPOSED TO BE A TEAM.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.639
WE SUPPOSED TO BE ONE.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.305
AND YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE MY

09:32.305 --> 09:33.907
BACK, AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU

09:33.907 --> 09:34.875
DID AT ALL.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.976
I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU DON'T

09:35.976 --> 09:37.177
UNDERSTAND, LIKE, I HAD

09:37.177 --> 09:37.845
YOUR BACK.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.681
MAYBE YOU JUST WAS GOING OFF,

09:40.681 --> 09:42.149
AND YOU AIN'T SEE IT.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.251
ERICA FEELING LIKE MY MAMA GOT

09:44.251 --> 09:46.186
UP IN THE TABLE WHEN SHE THE ONE

09:46.186 --> 09:47.888
GOT UP AND RAN AROUND THE ROOM

09:47.888 --> 09:49.456
LIKE THE TASMANIAN DEVIL AND

09:49.456 --> 09:50.390
GOING CRAZY.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.792
YOU DID THAT, NOT MY MAMA,

09:51.792 --> 09:52.492
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

09:52.492 --> 09:53.794
SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD HER OWN PART,

09:53.794 --> 09:54.728
BUT YOU THE ONE WENT CRAZY AND

09:54.728 --> 09:56.429
TOOK IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.497
I HAD EVERY RIGHT TO DO WHAT

09:57.497 --> 09:59.667
I DID BECAUSE I WAS IN MY HOME.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.834
I FEEL LIKE YOUR MOM GOT OUT OF

10:00.834 --> 10:02.069
LINE ONCE AGAIN.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.704
I MEAN, YEAH, BUT I HAVE BEEN

10:03.704 --> 10:06.239
KNOWING MY MAMA FOREVER AND EVER

10:06.239 --> 10:07.607
AND EVER, SO YOU KNOW WHAT I

10:07.607 --> 10:08.308
LEARNED TO DO?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.442
I LEARNED TO IGNORE THE

10:09.442 --> 10:10.778
CRAZINESS THAT COMES FROM OUT OF

10:10.778 --> 10:12.045
IT, YOU FEEL ME?

10:12.045 --> 10:12.913
BUT YOU KEEP SAYING YOU CAN'T

10:12.913 --> 10:13.814
KEEP HER FROM DOING THAT, AND I

10:13.814 --> 10:14.782
BELIEVE YOU CAN.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.716
I CAN'T.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.483
THERE'S NO WAY IN THE WORLD.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.384
SHE'S A GROWN PERSON,

10:17.384 --> 10:18.051
YOU FEEL ME?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.519
SHE'S A GROWN--OLDER THAN ME,

10:19.519 --> 10:20.187
YOU FEEL ME?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.154
AND NOT GONNA LET NOBODY JUST

10:21.154 --> 10:22.222
TELL HER WHAT TO DO,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.757
YOU FEEL ME?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.325
OKAY, WITH THAT BEING SAID

10:25.325 --> 10:26.960
THEN, THAT'S WHY I COME TO THE

10:26.960 --> 10:28.829
CONCLUSION WHERE I WANT TO PUMP

10:28.829 --> 10:30.497
THE BRAKES.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.164
PUMP MY BRAKES?

10:31.164 --> 10:32.065
WHAT THAT MEAN?

10:32.065 --> 10:32.766
I DON'T WANT TO START

10:32.766 --> 10:34.768
PLANNING THE WEDDING TILL I

10:34.768 --> 10:36.036
HONESTLY FEEL LIKE YOU GOT MY

10:36.036 --> 10:37.705

10:40.040 --> 10:41.041
"HEY, MOM, YOU CAN'T KEEP

10:41.041 --> 10:42.209
DISRESPECTING HER."

10:42.209 --> 10:42.943
THIS IS NOT BOYFRIEND AND

10:42.943 --> 10:43.610
GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.945
WE ENGAGED.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.381

10:51.318 --> 10:52.485

10:55.956 --> 10:57.691

10:57.691 --> 10:59.059
I SAY WE FOCUS ON US.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.293
SHE DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.029
SHE WANT TO FOCUS ON MY MAMA,

11:02.029 --> 11:03.563
THEN GO HOLLER AT MY MAMA.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.597
EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW, I GOT

11:04.597 --> 11:05.265
YOUR BACK.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.499
I GOT YOUR BACK.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.801
BUT, HEY, IF YOU DON'T FEEL IT,

11:07.801 --> 11:09.536
LIKE I SAY, MAYBE YOU NEED TO

11:09.536 --> 11:11.338
THINK ABOUT THAT,

11:11.338 --> 11:12.773
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.841
I WANT TO HOLD OFF.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.208
LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

35:37.769 --> 35:38.670
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CAN'T

35:43.275 --> 35:43.942
IF YOU HAD COMPANY

AHH.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.879
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE COMPANY?

35:47.879 --> 35:48.814
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

35:48.814 --> 35:50.015
WE NEED TO HANDLE BUSINESS,

35:50.015 --> 35:51.217
AND WE CAN'T HANDLE BUSINESS

35:51.217 --> 35:53.018
BECAUSE YOU GOT SOME RANDOM IN

35:58.924 --> 35:59.591
SIT DOWN.

35:59.591 --> 36:00.392
THERE SHE GO.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.693
THE RANDOM IS IN THE BUILDING.

36:01.693 --> 36:02.594
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW

36:02.594 --> 36:03.262
UP TO MY DOOR.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.530
THAT'S FIRST--COMMON COURTESY.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.464
YOU RIGHT.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.832
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP TO

36:06.832 --> 36:09.701
YOUR DOOR WITH $25,000 TO INVEST

36:09.701 --> 36:10.802
IN YOUR [bleep] BUSINESS.

36:10.802 --> 36:11.470
IN OUR BUSINESS.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.904
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP

36:12.904 --> 36:14.840
TO THE DOOR BECAUSE YOU GOT A

36:14.840 --> 36:16.041
POPCORN, MICROWAVABLE BITCH IN

36:16.041 --> 36:16.708
THE HOUSE.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.943
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

36:17.943 --> 36:19.144
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

36:19.144 --> 36:19.978
I KNOW WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

36:19.978 --> 36:20.679
SO YOU DON'T SHOW UP--

36:20.679 --> 36:22.047
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THESE

36:22.047 --> 36:24.049
[bleep] ALWAYS AFFECT SOMETHING.

36:24.049 --> 36:24.916
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW

36:24.916 --> 36:26.252
UP TO MY HOUSE.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.653
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.820
IT'S GREAT THAT TRACI BROUGHT ME

36:28.820 --> 36:30.256
THIS CHECK, BUT SHE HAS TO

36:30.256 --> 36:31.623
RESPECT MY BOUNDARIES.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.991
I DON'T GO TO HER HOUSE AND

36:32.991 --> 36:34.560
KNOCK ON THE DOOR UNEXPECTEDLY.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.261
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.462
TRACI HAS A LITTLE BOSSY

36:36.462 --> 36:37.963
TENDENCY, AND SHE HAS TO REALIZE

36:37.963 --> 36:38.864
SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

36:38.864 --> 36:39.598
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.266
REALLY?

36:40.266 --> 36:40.932
HOW IS THIS AFFECTING

36:40.932 --> 36:41.600
ANYTHING?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.268
UM...

36:42.268 --> 36:43.269
SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

36:43.269 --> 36:44.135
YOU DON'T HAVE NO WORDS.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.704
NO, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.672
DO NOT SPEAK.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.473
SAY SOMETHING AGAIN.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.474
SAY SOMETHING--

36:48.474 --> 36:49.140
GET THE [bleep] OFF.

36:49.140 --> 36:49.875
WELL, WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?

36:49.875 --> 36:50.842
SAY SOMETHING AGAIN!

36:50.842 --> 36:51.677
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?

36:51.677 --> 36:52.678
COME RIGHT HERE.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.679
THESE [bleep] DON'T OPEN

36:53.679 --> 36:54.480
THEIR MOUTH!

36:54.480 --> 36:55.814
YOU TRAIN THESE [bleep]!

36:55.814 --> 36:56.682
THEY DON'T OPEN THEY [bleep]

36:56.682 --> 36:57.349
MOUTH!

36:57.349 --> 36:58.183
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

36:58.183 --> 36:58.850
CHILL OUT.

36:58.850 --> 36:59.951
YOU SHUT THE [bleep] UP!

36:59.951 --> 37:00.819
YOU SIT IN THE CORNER, AND YOU

37:00.819 --> 37:02.288
BE QUIET.

37:02.288 --> 37:02.954
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

37:02.954 --> 37:03.822
SIT DOWN!

37:03.822 --> 37:05.624
SIT DOWN.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.427
GET OFF ME!

37:08.427 --> 37:10.862
COME HERE.

37:10.862 --> 37:11.897
IF WE DON'T DO THIS, I'M GOING

37:11.897 --> 37:12.564
ON TOUR AGAIN.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.099
I DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS [bleep].

37:14.099 --> 37:14.833
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO BE A

37:14.833 --> 37:15.634
BABY MAMA?

37:15.634 --> 37:16.935
HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AFFECTS

37:16.935 --> 37:18.169
ME, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

37:18.169 --> 37:19.137
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

37:19.137 --> 37:21.373
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.818
COME HERE.

37:32.818 --> 37:33.919
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THIS IS MAKING

37:33.919 --> 37:35.887
YOU SO ANGRY.

37:35.887 --> 37:36.922
HUH?

37:36.922 --> 37:38.457
WHY IS THIS MAKING YOU SO ANGRY?

37:38.457 --> 37:39.591
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO--

37:39.591 --> 37:40.592
I'M SO TIRED--

37:40.592 --> 37:41.427
SO WHAT YOU MEAN IT HAS NOTHING

37:41.427 --> 37:42.093
TO DO WITH ME?

37:42.093 --> 37:42.794
YOU HAVEN'T DEALT WITH

37:42.794 --> 37:43.462
ANYBODY EXPECT ME.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.195
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR

37:44.195 --> 37:45.030
FAMILY.

37:45.030 --> 37:45.931
RIGHT. MY FAMILY COMES FIRST.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.333
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND--

37:47.333 --> 37:48.800
WE NEVER COME FIRST.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.069
EVERY TWO SECONDS, IT'S ANOTHER

37:51.069 --> 37:51.937
BITCH.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.439
MY SON GOT TO BE OVER THERE.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.973
I GOT TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU,

37:54.973 --> 37:56.141
AND I GOT TO SEE THIS [bleep]?

37:56.141 --> 37:57.008
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.143
IN SCIENCE CLASS, WE LEARNED

37:58.143 --> 37:58.810
WHAT?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.145
THAT WE'RE NOT MONOGAMOUS.

38:00.145 --> 38:00.912
WHAT THE [bleep] IS WRONG

38:00.912 --> 38:01.580
WITH YOU?

38:01.580 --> 38:02.614
WE ARE NOT NATURALLY

38:02.614 --> 38:03.649
MONOGAMOUS, SO WHY DO I HAVE

38:03.649 --> 38:04.350
TO FIGHT NATURE?

38:04.350 --> 38:04.983
WHY DO I HAVE TO GO--

38:04.983 --> 38:05.651
WHAT THE [bleep]?

38:05.651 --> 38:06.352
AND SO THIS IS WHAT YOU

38:06.352 --> 38:06.985
TEACHING DREW?

38:06.985 --> 38:07.653
I'M JUST SAYING.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.454
YOU WANT HIM TO GROW UP TO BE

38:08.454 --> 38:09.120
THIS?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.088
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

38:10.088 --> 38:10.922
THIS.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.157
THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO

38:12.157 --> 38:13.492
WITH THIS.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.393
TRACI IS OUT OF CONTROL FOR

38:14.393 --> 38:16.027
TRYING TO CONTROL MY LOVE LIFE.

38:16.027 --> 38:16.795
I CAN DATE WHOEVER THE HELL I

38:16.795 --> 38:18.063
WANT TO DATE, AND SHE CAN'T TELL

38:18.063 --> 38:19.365
ME OTHERWISE.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.932
I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M HANDSOME.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.001
LOOK AT THIS FACE.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.370
WHAT I DO ON MY OWN TIME IS WHAT

38:24.370 --> 38:25.371
I DO ON MY OWN TIME.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.005
GOOD, WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY

38:27.005 --> 38:29.741
IS WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.576
ALL THIS MONEY, AND YOU JUST

38:30.576 --> 38:31.443
WANT TO THROW THE BUSINESS AWAY

38:31.443 --> 38:32.110
LIKE THAT?

38:32.110 --> 38:32.778
WE'RE DONE.

38:32.778 --> 38:33.979
STOP TALKING TO ME.

38:33.979 --> 38:34.880
CAN YOU GO HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS?

38:34.880 --> 38:35.581
GO HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.548
THIS IS MY BUSINESS.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.983
MY SON HAS NOT SEEN A GIRL--

38:37.983 --> 38:38.784
I REMEMBER ONE TIME, WE WAS

38:38.784 --> 38:39.918
IN THE AIRPORT AND DREWSIE

38:39.918 --> 38:43.288

38:43.288 --> 38:44.656
DO YOU KNOW HOW I WANTED TO

38:44.656 --> 38:46.992
MOTHER...

38:46.992 --> 38:48.694
MY SON SHOULD NEVER CALL ME

38:48.694 --> 38:50.462
ANOTHER WOMAN NAME.

38:50.462 --> 38:51.897
NEVER.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.499
BUT YOU HAVE THAT BECAUSE YOU

38:53.499 --> 38:55.133
INTRODUCING HIM TO THEM.

38:55.133 --> 38:55.901
I'VE MADE MISTAKES IN THE

38:55.901 --> 38:56.568
PAST.

38:56.568 --> 38:57.436
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.103
THIS YEAR--

38:58.103 --> 38:58.904
DREW, WE'RE DONE.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.238
STOP BEING SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT

39:00.238 --> 39:00.906

39:00.906 --> 39:02.173

39:20.692 --> 39:21.427

39:21.427 --> 39:22.060
WE NEED TO DO BUSINESS.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.061
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

39:23.061 --> 39:23.729
IT'S ALL ABOUT--

39:23.729 --> 39:24.496

39:28.299 --> 39:29.435
IF WE DON'T DO THIS, I'M GOING

39:29.435 --> 39:30.101

39:32.037 --> 39:33.705
YOU STAY FOR YOUR SON.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.106
IT'S LIKE IT'S NEVER ENDING.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.708
MY LIFE IS THIS, AND I DIDN'T

39:36.708 --> 39:38.309
CHOOSE THIS LIFE.

39:38.309 --> 39:39.978
I DIDN'T--DO YOU THINK I WANT TO

39:39.978 --> 39:41.346
BE A BABY MAMA?
