00:01.131 --> 00:02.959
<i>Previously on Alaska Daily...</i>

00:02.959 --> 00:04.917
This is gonna derail
the General's confirmation,
isn't it?

00:04.917 --> 00:07.920
Considering he's the President's
choice for Defense Secretary,

00:07.920 --> 00:10.053
I think the American people
have a right to know.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.750
Look, the General's a bad guy.
We know it.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.056
But if
the documents are fake--

00:13.056 --> 00:14.231
It's on them to prove they are.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.841
The General uses power
and connections

00:15.841 --> 00:17.234
to sell arms to bad people.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.062
Innocent people
died as a result.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.109
Hey.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.026
What happened?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.071
You passed out
and hit your head.

00:28.071 --> 00:31.074
I had a panic attack.
I'm fine, Stanley.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.902
It doesn't sound to me
like you're fine.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.338
Eileen Fitzgerald.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.079
<i>I think I have
something for you.</i>

00:36.079 --> 00:37.689
Is this what I think it is?

00:37.689 --> 00:39.387
The un-redacted police report.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.477
There's two names--
Ezra Fisher and Rega Horne.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.702
See where they're out of.

00:52.008 --> 00:52.965
What is that?

00:53.879 --> 00:55.446
A ferret.

00:55.446 --> 00:56.491
A ferret?

00:56.491 --> 00:58.101
My son has show-and-tell
after lunch.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.321
I'm on ferret carpool duty.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.670
Is it safe?

01:01.670 --> 01:03.976
It's a "he," and he's fine.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.413
His name is Hairy Potter.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.590
I've never seen a ferret
up close.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.026
Hey, Hairy.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.158
There's a ferret in there?

01:11.158 --> 01:13.160
- Mm-hmm.
- Aren't ferrets dangerous?

01:13.160 --> 01:14.335
Apparently not.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.989
Definitely not.
Just a little stinky.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.730
I have some rose water spray.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.384
Worth a shot.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.473
Bob, I need to talk to you
about the Parks piece.

01:22.473 --> 01:25.389
Okay. I got a quick call.
Pop by my office in 10.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.348
- Sans ferret.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.089
There you go, Hairy.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.570
Anything on Ezra Fisher?

01:32.570 --> 01:33.876
Nothing yet.

01:33.876 --> 01:36.183
Did a quick search on socials.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.402
Moving on to addresses
and phone numbers.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.408
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What?

01:44.408 --> 01:46.149
The Secretary of Defense
is giving a speech

01:46.149 --> 01:47.977
at JBEM tomorrow.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.719
Green? Have you had any contact
since the <i>Vanguard</i> piece?

01:50.719 --> 01:53.504
- No. But something's going on.
- Why?

01:53.504 --> 01:56.028
Well, these rah-rah trips
are never announced last minute.

01:56.028 --> 01:59.423
Knowing him, I guarantee the
speech is a cover for something.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.077
Hey.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.166
Eileen.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.604
We're still on
Rega and Ezra, right?

02:06.604 --> 02:08.998
Gimme a minute.
I need to talk to Stanley.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.705
- You hear from your sources?
- Nothing.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.403
I called and texted
my guy in the press shop.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.405
- He's dodging.
- Hm.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.842
I'll get him. Hey, do you mind
if I bring Yuna?

02:26.842 --> 02:29.540
She still struggling
with the fallout from Teller?

02:29.540 --> 02:32.195
I mean, she's better, but she
hasn't pitched any stories.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.023
Thought maybe she could
draft off me for a bit?

02:35.285 --> 02:37.461
Green is gonna be
at the Air Force base tomorrow.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.247
I'm aware. Can you please knock
when my door is shut?

02:40.247 --> 02:43.075
Uh, I need to be there.
Are you good with me going?

02:43.075 --> 02:44.251
I gave the story to Austin.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.731
What? Why?

02:46.731 --> 02:48.690
He covers the base. That's why.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.518
Come on, Stanley.
This is my guy.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.434
I know him better than anyone.
It'll make a better article.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.826
No offense.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.654
I've covered JBEM
for three years.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.656
I have relationships, sources.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.354
And I'm wired into Green.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.572
So download me.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.965
You're not gonna
big-foot me here.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.401
It's Austin's story.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.229
So send me with him.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.188
- I'm sending Yuna with him.
- Oh, come on, Austin.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.363
Why don't you just
take her to the movies

03:09.363 --> 03:11.626
- if you want to get laid?
- Are you serious?!

03:11.626 --> 03:12.844
Austin, can we have the room?

03:14.759 --> 03:16.631
Have the room, but keep her
away from my story.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.421
Why are you doing this?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.597
You know this is important
to me, my book.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.338
This isn't about your book.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.167
Eileen, you have
unfinished business with Green.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.430
Exactly. My past with him
makes this a better story

03:33.430 --> 03:35.171
and gets more eyeballs
on the paper.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.564
Isn't that the point?

03:36.564 --> 03:38.566
Not if it threatens
the integrity of the paper.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.438
It's just too risky for us
to have you in front of Green.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.875
Having Austin on it
is what's best.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.923
This is about my panic attacks,
isn't it?

03:47.923 --> 03:49.751
That is certainly part of it.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.362
That, and I don't want you
to become the story.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.060
This is not the time.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.237
As your editor and your friend,

03:57.237 --> 03:59.674
I'm telling you,
stay away from Green.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.290
What smells bad?

04:07.290 --> 04:08.726
My son's ferret.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.120
Of course.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.142
Where'd you go?

04:33.142 --> 04:35.449
What? Oh.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.712
Sorry. I lost track of time.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.104
Time? Or the story?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.978
- Stanley bench you?
- He did.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.327
- Now you're pissed.
- I am.

04:44.327 --> 04:48.331
Why? I don't know.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.986
Maybe because the guy I tripped
over on the way to cancel town

04:50.986 --> 04:52.944
is here under
curious circumstances,

04:52.944 --> 04:55.817
and he's sending
the love birds.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.385
Yeah, sucks when someone else
gets assigned to a story

04:58.385 --> 05:00.604
you're deeply invested in

05:00.604 --> 05:03.955
and feel like you could cover
all by yourself, doesn't it?

05:05.827 --> 05:08.656
Come on.
We're going to the courthouse.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.658
- Why?
- I did your work on Ezra Fisher.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.094
He's in Anchorage,

05:12.094 --> 05:14.226
and he's got an open
domestic-violence charge.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.272
Prosecutor on the case
is in court today.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.056
Then so are we.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
Rega Horne might as well
not exist.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.944
Search engines, socials--
they turn up nothing.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.859
Most people leave
some kind of footprint.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.948
This guy? Total ghost.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.298
But this Ezra Fisher--
he has a healthy rap sheet?

05:42.298 --> 05:44.692
Two accounts of assault
and battery of a girlfriend,

05:44.692 --> 05:46.607
including the open
domestic-violence charge.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.435
Uh, who's the prosecutor?

05:48.435 --> 05:50.306
- Adam Barnett.
- Anything on him?

05:50.306 --> 05:53.222
I like what I've read online,
but I wouldn't get our hopes up.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.009
Any idea why Green would
be trekking here from DC?

05:58.009 --> 06:00.403
No. Normally when
the Secretary of Defense comes,

06:00.403 --> 06:01.491
we get a heads-up.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.797
How much?

06:02.797 --> 06:04.407
A week, maybe two.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.149
Okay, off the record,
you must be hearing something.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.020
Radio silence.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.761
But completely off the record?

06:10.761 --> 06:13.373
The vibe's been weird
on base all week.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.635
What do you mean?

06:14.635 --> 06:17.464
It's like...
everyone's tense, man.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.291
I don't know what it is,
but you can feel it.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.989
Because Green's coming?

06:20.989 --> 06:22.947
Even before the news broke.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.688
Has it been like this before?

06:24.688 --> 06:27.038
Last time it was like this
was two years ago.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.171
Two Su-57s
and a Blackjack bomber

06:29.171 --> 06:32.435
penetrated our Alaskan
Air Defense Identification Zone.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.045
We had to scramble our F-22s.

06:34.045 --> 06:37.005
- Jesus.
- We're on the front lines.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.876
With climate change
melting the ice caps,

06:38.876 --> 06:40.443
the Arctic's up for grabs.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.401
The Russians are testing us.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.752
I gotta go prepare
for this briefing.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.841
Speaking of which...

06:46.841 --> 06:48.712
Green's comms director
wants to make sure that

06:48.712 --> 06:50.192
Eileen Fitzgerald's
not in attendance.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.236
She assigned to cover?

06:51.236 --> 06:52.455
No, she won't be there.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.283
Just me and another reporter,
Yuna Park.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.850
- Good. Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.113
If I hear anything unofficial,
I'll let you know.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.426
Oh, no. Hairy?

07:11.518 --> 07:14.477
Um... guys,

07:14.477 --> 07:16.871
did anyone let the ferret
out of the bag?

07:16.871 --> 07:18.176
- Not me.
- No.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.264
Is it missing?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.571
Okay.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.704
Hairy Potter escaped.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.749
Everybody look around.
Under desks.

07:25.749 --> 07:28.578
In desks. Bags.
He's a sneaky little sh--

07:28.578 --> 07:29.666
Are you sure
it's not dangerous?

07:29.666 --> 07:31.625
I'm sure, okay?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.017
Okay, I'm not totally sure, but...

07:33.017 --> 07:34.149
What's going on?

07:35.977 --> 07:37.718
The ferret got out, Bob.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.633
How?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.504
Apparently he knows
how to use a zipper.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.201
Well, that's a little frightening.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.769
I have to call Pete's teacher
and postpone the show-and-tell.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.510
She already thinks
I'm a terrible mother.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.556
Hold.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.820
Let's first see
if we, as a newsroom,

07:52.820 --> 07:54.517
can't rectify the situation,
shall we?

07:54.517 --> 07:56.432
Uh, okay, everyone,

07:56.432 --> 07:58.390
let's divide the office
into quadrants

07:58.390 --> 08:01.872
and do outward sweeps
using this as a center point.

08:01.872 --> 08:05.485
Operation Find Hairy Potter
is in effect.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.661
Did you check over there?

08:07.661 --> 08:09.227
Come back to your bag!

08:09.227 --> 08:10.794
- Hairy. Hairy?
- Come here!

08:10.794 --> 08:12.013
Your Honor, the State feels

08:12.013 --> 08:13.841
it can no longer
pursue this case.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.234
We're moving
to dismiss all charges.

08:16.234 --> 08:19.150
On what basis does the State
make that recommendation?

08:19.150 --> 08:23.285
The victim has been
very difficult to contact.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.462
Does defense counsel object?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.595
No objection.
Thank you, Your Honor.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.859
Okay. 4589 is dismissed.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.733
What's your count?

08:36.733 --> 08:40.432
That makes eight dismissals,
three going to trial.

08:40.432 --> 08:44.045
Case 5321.

08:44.045 --> 08:46.351
Assault in the first degree.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.962
It's our guy.

08:49.790 --> 08:53.881
ADA Barnett, why is this
in front of me again?

08:53.881 --> 08:56.971
Your Honor, I am asking the
court to reconsider this case.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.190
The victim suffered horribly.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.584
My ruling to dismiss was clear.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.846
What are we doing here today?

09:02.846 --> 09:04.761
Are we checking items
off a to-do list

09:04.761 --> 09:06.807
or are we defending
the human rights of Alaskans?

09:06.807 --> 09:09.026
We have some new evidence
for the court to consider.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.681
The state requests
a trial by jury.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.598
Okay.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.514
5321 ordered to trial.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.951
Check with the clerk
for trial dates.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.083
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.739
ADA Barnett. Eileen Fitzgerald,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

09:25.739 --> 09:28.306
And this is my colleague
Roz Friendly.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.960
Hi. How can I help you?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.832
We'd like to talk to you
about Ezra Fisher.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.224
What about him?

09:33.224 --> 09:35.444
We're investigating
the death of Gloria Nanmac,

09:35.444 --> 09:37.098
an Iñupiaq woman from Meade.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.970
Ezra was a person of interest
in the police report.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.233
Happy to help.
You wanna come to my office?

09:42.233 --> 09:43.931
Yeah.

09:45.323 --> 09:48.936
Unfortunately, what you describe
in Gloria's case isn't unusual,

09:48.936 --> 09:52.548
and as you saw today, even when
police catch the bad guys,

09:52.548 --> 09:55.029
prosecutors drop the ball.

09:55.029 --> 09:58.467
The system grinds down
even idealistic prosecutors.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.078
There's just too many cases. Thousands.

10:01.078 --> 10:04.516
The system fails women,
especially Native women.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.996
Can you tell us about Ezra?

10:05.996 --> 10:07.345
Off the record?

10:07.345 --> 10:09.913
I want to help you get justice
for this Gloria,

10:09.913 --> 10:12.089
but I'd be fired
if the attorney general

10:12.089 --> 10:13.308
knew I was talking to you.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.483
Off the record.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.572
Ezra Fisher is a nasty guy.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.705
I'll set you up to talk
to my DV victim--

10:18.705 --> 10:22.534
his ex, name is Taylor--
so you can hear firsthand.

10:22.534 --> 10:27.278
He's violent, unpredictable,
a charmer.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.672
That's a bad combination.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.500
Do you think
he could have killed Gloria?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.284
I don't know the case,

10:33.284 --> 10:36.113
but I'm not surprised
he's a suspect.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.680
You know
where we could find him?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.248
He works for Denali Broadband.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.685
Puts up cell towers
all over the state.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.428
Uh, Taylor said he's working
in Anchorage now.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.214
Here is her contact.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.086
And hey...

10:52.086 --> 10:54.566
be careful around Ezra.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.526
I've unscrewed
all the vent covers,

10:57.526 --> 10:59.006
checked inside
with a flashlight.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.270
I think he's gone.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.536
I'm sorry.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.496
I can't believe
this happened on my watch.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.411
This is not your fault.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.720
The number-one goal of anything
in a cage is to escape.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.767
It's a natural law.

11:20.767 --> 11:21.985
Is it?

11:21.985 --> 11:25.032
As far as I'm concerned, it is.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.121
I just feel like some days,
I can't get anything right.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.864
You're an amazing reporter.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.214
Thanks, Bob. That's nice.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.826
But, boy, does life get messy.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.089
I do not do well with messy.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.875
Messy makes me very anxious.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.312
I can see why Eileen
freaks you out.

11:44.312 --> 11:48.055
She's like having an 800-pound
ferret in the office.

11:48.055 --> 11:51.798
Talk about slippery and shifty
and unpredictable.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.584
But not without her merits.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.238
True.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.892
Not without her merits.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.420
Oh, Bob.
Don't let her get to you.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.553
She's just... Eileen.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.382
I know. I know.
It's not just that.

12:13.689 --> 12:16.344
Colleen is sick.

12:16.344 --> 12:19.782
Oh, no. Bob.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.218
What's happening?

12:21.218 --> 12:22.872
I'd rather not talk about it

12:22.872 --> 12:25.832
because it's new and...

12:27.616 --> 12:29.444
I very well may cry.

12:32.012 --> 12:35.363
But we're going...
one day at a time.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.846
She has an amazing attitude
about it all.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.979
And you?

12:42.979 --> 12:45.155
Me?

12:45.155 --> 12:46.504
I feel...

12:48.158 --> 12:49.594
...lost.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.863
We're looking at Ezra Fisher

12:56.863 --> 12:58.952
in connection with a murder.
We understand you have

12:58.952 --> 13:01.258
a domestic-violence case
against him?

13:01.258 --> 13:03.260
Yeah, he beat me up
when we were together.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.871
He's a violent jerk.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.003
How violent?

13:07.003 --> 13:09.658
He gave me a black eye,

13:09.658 --> 13:13.227
stitches in my head,
bruised rib.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.795
That's awful. I'm sorry.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.059
I just want Ezra locked up so
that he can't hurt me or my son.

13:19.059 --> 13:21.061
Is Ezra the father?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.805
Do you think
he's capable of murder?

13:27.719 --> 13:30.461
All I know
is that he's a bad guy.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.899
Especially when he's drunk.
He gets real mean.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.163
I really gotta go.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.252
- Thank you.
- We'll be in touch.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.350
What do you think?

13:49.350 --> 13:52.135
Barnett was right.
Ezra is nasty.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.964
I'll find out
where he's working tomorrow.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.837
We can pay him a visit.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.724
Ezra's on a project downtown.

14:16.899 --> 14:17.987
Excellent.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.642
Is this for me?

14:20.642 --> 14:21.861
Yeah.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.124
Thanks? Why?

14:24.124 --> 14:26.953
'Cause it's morning
and I bought two.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.827
You mind speaking to Ezra
by yourself?

14:31.827 --> 14:33.873
I thought Stanley told you
to stay away from Green.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.963
He did. Now can you
drop me at the base?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.007
That would make me
a co-conspirator.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.356
Which is exciting.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.749
Not.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.143
Maybe a little bit?

14:45.319 --> 14:47.190
<i>♪ No excuses♪</i>

14:47.190 --> 14:50.106
<i>♪ Round and round and round
and here we go♪</i>

14:55.285 --> 14:57.722
IDs, please. Thank you.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.812
- Oh, my God. I know them.
- Who?

15:00.812 --> 15:03.076
The Chois. My mother
worked with her. Hold on.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.389
Mr. and Mrs. Choi,
will you come right this way?

16:06.443 --> 16:08.097
- All good?
- That was weird.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.794
Yeah? What'd they say?

16:09.794 --> 16:11.579
Park, Teague,
you can go in now.

16:11.579 --> 16:12.710
Oh. Thank you.

16:12.710 --> 16:13.973
I'll tell you
when we're inside.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.017
Yeah.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.633
- Coffee?
- With milk. Thank you.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.420
How's Pete?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.988
Went to bed sobbing,
woke up sobbing.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.032
Ugh. That sounds rough.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.034
It was.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.731
How are you today?

16:33.731 --> 16:35.864
I'm happy to be at work.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.561
I know that feeling.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.219
Maybe Hairy will show up today.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.178
Let's not give up on hope.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.571
Oh. Hope in the newsroom.

16:47.571 --> 16:51.184
That feels very... retro,
doesn't it?

16:51.184 --> 16:53.403
Hope in general feels retro.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.192
Ezra Fisher?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.716
Yeah.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.500
Roz Friendly of
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

17:03.500 --> 17:05.502
Can I speak with you?

17:09.289 --> 17:10.551
What's this about?

17:11.900 --> 17:14.250
Gloria Nanmac,
an Iñupiaq woman

17:14.250 --> 17:18.428
who went missing two years ago
up in Meade, ended up dead.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.300
Yeah? I remember Gloria.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.084
You knew her?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.085
I knew her a bit.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.956
You were friends?

17:24.956 --> 17:27.133
I mean, I'd seen her around.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.744
Did you happen to see her
the night she went missing?

17:29.744 --> 17:31.746
Last place she was known
to be alive

17:31.746 --> 17:34.009
was at a house belonging
to Clarence Redding.

17:34.009 --> 17:37.012
Skeeter. Yeah. I know him.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.927
Was he a friend of yours?

17:38.927 --> 17:40.146
Not really.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.800
I mean, if you were
looking for drugs

17:42.800 --> 17:45.020
or just about anything else,
you'd go to Skeeter's.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.849
And were you there
the night Gloria went missing?

17:49.198 --> 17:51.548
- Yeah, I was there.
- Is that why you're listed

17:51.548 --> 17:53.550
as a person of interest
on the Meade police report?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.510
How do you know that?

17:56.510 --> 17:59.556
We're working with the cops.

18:02.255 --> 18:05.084
Look, I remember she came to
Skeeter's looking for Oxy.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.694
Why was she looking for Oxy?

18:06.694 --> 18:10.263
She had pain from frostbite.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.917
Couldn't get what she needed
from the doctor, I guess.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.006
No one at Skeeter's had any,
so she left.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.486
Did you see her leave Skeeter's?

18:17.531 --> 18:19.576
I'm pretty sure she was
still there when I left.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.275
I had to get my kid.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.060
Did you kill Gloria?

18:26.148 --> 18:28.194
What?

18:28.194 --> 18:31.632
No. Why would I do that?

18:31.632 --> 18:33.982
Wait. W-Who's saying
I killed her? The cops?

18:33.982 --> 18:35.375
There's an open domestic
violence case against you.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.854
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.336
Are you talking to Adam Barnett?

18:44.297 --> 18:46.690
Look.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.432
Hitting Taylor was the biggest
mistake of my life.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.522
I mean, she's the mother
of my kid, for Christ's sake.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.045
And even if the court
lets me off,

18:54.045 --> 18:56.483
I'm gonna have to
live with that forever.

18:58.354 --> 19:02.010
But this guy, Barnett?

19:02.010 --> 19:03.968
He's-- He's twisting everything.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.363
When he was throwing shade
on me,

19:07.363 --> 19:10.192
did he happen to mention
that he's sleeping with Taylor?

19:12.368 --> 19:14.631
Yeah. Didn't think so.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.025
So of course
he's trying to trash me.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.377
But he's the ADA.
What am I gonna do?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.340
Hey.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.080
<i>I spoke with Ezra.</i>

19:29.080 --> 19:30.821
And?

19:30.821 --> 19:33.998
He claims that Adam Barnett
is sleeping with Taylor.

19:33.998 --> 19:37.524
The ADA?
He's sleeping with Ezra's ex?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.395
<i>That's what he said.</i>

19:39.395 --> 19:41.005
Well, you believe him?

19:41.005 --> 19:43.269
<i>I don't know,
but if it is true,</i>

19:43.269 --> 19:46.010
that's gonna be a major
conflict of interest.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.056
Well, we got to look into
all his other cases.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.493
This might not be the first time
Barnett did this.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.452
I was thinking the same thing.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.802
All right. Well, good work.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.760
I'll jump right back in with you
as soon as I can.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.720
You gotta be kidding me.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.592
Stay calm. I come in peace.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.420
- You're really doing this?
- I am.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.074
But I'm not here
to big-foot you. Promise.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.858
But you do what you do.
I won't interfere.

20:07.858 --> 20:10.687
This is just too important.
Where's the Secretary?

20:10.687 --> 20:11.906
He's running behind.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.560
Uh, what are you hearing?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.128
I'm hearing
that the base is tense

20:17.128 --> 20:21.568
and it may or may not be related
to the Secretary being here.

20:21.568 --> 20:22.612
Anything else?

20:25.528 --> 20:27.661
This might not be related,
but I just ran into

20:27.661 --> 20:29.228
some friends of my parents.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.055
Their son, Greg Choi,
is a fighter pilot,

20:31.055 --> 20:32.274
and no one's heard from him
in a week.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.928
What's the Air Force
telling them?

20:33.928 --> 20:35.756
Not much,
from what I can tell.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.105
And the pilot-- what's he fly?

20:37.105 --> 20:38.715
He's in the 486th Fighter Wing.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.327
They've got the new F41s.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.980
I did a story last year

20:42.980 --> 20:44.895
on delays getting
the F41 into service.

20:44.895 --> 20:47.942
The F41s are built by Armeon.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.248
Yeah.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.032
And neither Armeon
nor the Air Force

20:51.032 --> 20:52.512
would comment on the story.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.949
They said it was classified.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.560
And guess who was on
the board of Armeon then.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.996
My little buddy.

20:58.996 --> 21:03.349
Company, ten-hut!

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
No disrespect, but do you
want to create some space

21:05.307 --> 21:06.526
so that we don't get
lumped in with you?

21:06.526 --> 21:08.049
- Fair point.
- Okay.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.447
Be seated.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.929
At ease.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.803
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll be brief.

21:22.803 --> 21:26.154
Approximately 155 years ago,

21:26.154 --> 21:28.548
Secretary of State
William Seward

21:28.548 --> 21:30.985
purchased Alaska from Russia.

21:30.985 --> 21:34.336
This deal
was anything but folly.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.557
From Alaska,
we can get our forces

21:37.557 --> 21:39.254
anywhere in
the Northern Hemisphere

21:39.254 --> 21:41.300
in 10 hours.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.478
That means that every soldier
and airman here

21:45.478 --> 21:48.829
is a guardian of
and a first responder to

21:48.829 --> 21:51.005
the entire free world.

21:51.005 --> 21:54.269
As our enemies encroach
and the Arctic melts,

21:54.269 --> 21:59.274
Alaska Command has never been
more important or more vital

21:59.274 --> 22:00.971
to our homeland defense.

22:00.971 --> 22:04.279
The words spoken by
General Billy Mitchell in 1935

22:04.279 --> 22:07.935
have never been truer
than they are today--

22:07.935 --> 22:11.286
"Whoever holds Alaska
will hold the world."

22:12.200 --> 22:16.291
And we intend to hold Alaska
for another 155 years...

22:17.336 --> 22:18.511
...and beyond!

22:19.903 --> 22:21.383
Thank you.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.082
Our first question
goes to Austin Teague

22:25.082 --> 22:26.780
of <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

22:26.780 --> 22:28.956
Thank you. Mr. Secretary,

22:28.956 --> 22:31.480
this visit was arranged with
a great deal of spontaneity.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.830
Uh, is there another item
on your agenda here

22:33.830 --> 22:36.050
that the American people
should know about?

22:36.050 --> 22:38.226
Well, I-- I know
how important it is

22:38.226 --> 22:41.011
to make contact with our troops
when I can.

22:41.969 --> 22:46.930
I had the opportunity to remind
the fine service men and women

22:46.930 --> 22:49.542
of their great value
to this country.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.370
So I took it.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.721
Next question from Amelia
Glenway, <i>The Seattle Times.</i>

22:54.721 --> 22:57.854
Mr. Secretary, Eileen
Fitzgerald, <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

22:57.854 --> 23:00.596
Ma'am, I would ask that you
refrain from asking questions

23:00.596 --> 23:02.119
if you're not on
the scheduled list.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.339
Mr. Secretary, are you aware
that a pilot, Greg Choi,

23:04.339 --> 23:07.298
from the 486th,
has been missing for five days?

23:08.517 --> 23:10.606
Hello, Eileen.

23:10.606 --> 23:14.131
As usual, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.873
Let me fill you in.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.484
Sources on base say
that he went missing

23:18.484 --> 23:21.356
in one of the new
F41 fighter jets

23:21.356 --> 23:24.054
that you helped develop
and sell to the Air Force

23:24.054 --> 23:26.448
when you were an executive
at Armeon Corp.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.628
Do you care to comment
on the F41

23:32.628 --> 23:34.543
or the whereabouts
of Airman Choi?

23:34.543 --> 23:36.893
I have nothing further to say.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.068
Thank you.

23:38.068 --> 23:41.289
Company, ten-hut!

23:42.986 --> 23:44.814
Well, you blew that party up.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.468
He blinked. You saw it.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.165
Yeah, because you were making
crap up at the speed of light.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.732
Eileen, none of that
was verified.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.038
But it struck a nerve, which
means there's a connection.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.213
What if there's not?

23:52.213 --> 23:55.521
Ma'am, the Secretary
would like a word.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.236
Mr. Secretary.

24:17.281 --> 24:19.458
How's Alaska treating you,
Eileen?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.024
It's a great state.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.244
Why are you here?

24:23.244 --> 24:25.681
Eh. Routine visit.

24:26.726 --> 24:27.988
I don't believe you.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.644
Well, you made that
abundantly clear.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.211
Are you denying
that your visit here

24:34.211 --> 24:36.344
has anything to do
with Greg Choi?

24:36.344 --> 24:39.652
Well, I didn't ask to see you
to discuss Officer Choi.

24:39.652 --> 24:43.482
I-I actually wanted
to thank you, personally.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.092
Thank me?

24:45.092 --> 24:47.529
You have no idea how many times
your name came up

24:47.529 --> 24:51.359
behind closed doors
at my confirmation hearing.

24:51.359 --> 24:55.624
How disdain for you
became respect for me.

24:58.366 --> 25:01.021
Have you ever tried to calculate
the number of innocent civilians

25:01.021 --> 25:03.240
murdered by the dictators
you armed?

25:04.198 --> 25:06.853
I have. It's a big number.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.942
And it'll all be in my book.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.597
Yeah, you go ahead
and you write your book, Eileen.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.555
It'll probably put me
in the White House.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.601
Why are you here?

25:15.601 --> 25:17.516
'Cause it sure as hell
didn't have anything to do

25:17.516 --> 25:19.996
with that tired
General Billy Mitchell quote.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.261
It's all very embarrassing
what's happened to you.

25:25.349 --> 25:28.178
The big stories
are out of your reach now.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.050
You're spinning
out in the boonies.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.619
Are you making fun
of my current employer?

25:35.055 --> 25:38.885
<i>The Daily Alaskan</i> is a step
above a high-school yearbook.

25:40.495 --> 25:43.759
Mr. Secretary, few things
could make me happier

25:43.759 --> 25:47.067
than watching you underestimate
the power of a local newspaper.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.808
It may not be fancy

25:48.808 --> 25:52.028
and it may be far
from the halls of power in DC,

25:52.028 --> 25:55.597
but it's sure a hell
of a lot closer to the truth.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.382
I'll buy you a subscription
when I write my story.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.912
Corey, listen, man--

26:05.912 --> 26:07.609
You said Fitzgerald
wasn't assigned.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.524
She wasn't supposed to be.
She crashed the presser.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.308
The Secretary's comms director
just ripped me a new one.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.093
Yeah, well,
throw her in the brig.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.399
You'll be doing both of us
a favor.

26:15.399 --> 26:18.011
Trust me, Corey.
I wouldn't burn you.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.144
I gotta go clean this mess up.

26:42.862 --> 26:45.778
Hi, Cindy. This is Roz Friendly
of <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

26:45.778 --> 26:49.303
I understand that Adam Barnett
was in charge of your case.

26:49.303 --> 26:52.175
Hi. I'm trying to reach
a Liza Peters.

26:53.742 --> 26:56.397
Okay. And do you know
when she'll be home?

26:57.572 --> 26:59.661
Why did Adam Barnett
take you to the Lantern Inn

26:59.661 --> 27:00.967
for your meeting?

27:02.272 --> 27:04.231
Do you mind if I ask you
about your case?

27:05.493 --> 27:07.669
Did Adam Barnett
ever make an advance on you?

27:08.757 --> 27:10.280
No, I mean, ask you out.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.935
Okay.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.110
Thank you for your time.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.732
Ugh.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.475
<i>As usual, I have no idea
what you're talking about.</i>

27:32.868 --> 27:34.217
<i>Hello, Eileen.</i>

27:34.217 --> 27:36.306
<i>As usual, I have...</i>

27:40.397 --> 27:42.312
Yeah, well, I told my guy
you wouldn't be there.
He's a good source.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.879
He'll get over it.
They always do.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.141
Yeah, so says you.

27:45.141 --> 27:48.318
I'm telling you, I hit a nerve.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.363
So what'd he say?

27:49.363 --> 27:51.365
That I work for a crappy paper.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.975
He did?

27:52.975 --> 27:54.498
That's it?
He just insulted us?

27:54.498 --> 27:56.979
- That's it.
- We're low-hanging fruit.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.068
Hold on a second.
He didn't deny your allegation?

27:59.068 --> 28:00.548
No, Austin. He did not.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.724
- So we did hit a nerve.
- We most definitely did.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.465
All right, you gotta reach out
to Choi's parents.

28:04.465 --> 28:06.032
- We need to talk to them.
- On it.

28:07.511 --> 28:10.253
You're national news again, Eileen.

28:10.253 --> 28:12.038
Exactly what I wanted to avoid.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.735
Green is rotten. He's covering.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.432
Covering what?

28:15.432 --> 28:17.434
- The missing airman?
- Yeah. Choi.

28:17.434 --> 28:19.872
How did you find out
about him?

28:19.872 --> 28:22.004
Yuna. She knows his parents.
They were at the base.

28:22.004 --> 28:24.398
Look, we know
this has to do with the F41.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.661
Choi was flying it.
Armeon developed it.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.619
Look at the tape, Stanley.
Green flinched.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.447
- I don't disagree.
- All due respect, Aaron,

28:30.447 --> 28:32.275
I don't care
whether you agree or not.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.800
You went fishing without facts.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.890
That threatens the reputation
of this paper.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.195
Well, I didn't know we had one.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.328
Do not make light of this.

28:42.242 --> 28:44.810
You wanna go rogue,
you check with me first

28:44.810 --> 28:47.116
or I will not support you
in the future. Is that clear?

28:48.552 --> 28:49.640
Crystal.

28:59.607 --> 29:00.782
You good?

29:00.782 --> 29:02.262
A little sore.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.180
- Mr. Pritchard.
- Hey.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.659
Did I interrupt something?

29:08.659 --> 29:11.662
Just a pity party
after getting spanked.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.752
Any luck with the women you
reached out to about Barnett?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.754
They all deny a sexual
relationship with him.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.103
You think Ezra Fisher's lying?

29:17.103 --> 29:19.279
Maybe. I'll keep pushing.

29:20.628 --> 29:21.977
<i>We interrupt this broadcast</i>

29:21.977 --> 29:24.371
<i>for some breaking news.</i>

29:24.371 --> 29:26.939
<i>The Russian
embassy has just announced</i>

29:26.939 --> 29:29.985
<i>that its navy seized
a downed American aircraft</i>

29:29.985 --> 29:33.815
<i>in Russian territorial waters
five days ago.</i>

29:33.815 --> 29:36.383
<i>It also says Russian sailors</i>

29:36.383 --> 29:39.429
<i>recovered the body
of an American pilot.</i>

29:44.043 --> 29:45.479
What's the working theory?

29:45.479 --> 29:47.829
Well, while the State Department
quietly negotiated

29:47.829 --> 29:50.049
the return of
the plane and Choi's body,

29:50.049 --> 29:53.487
Green makes his appearance at
JBEM with a dubious explanation.

29:53.487 --> 29:56.098
And you think it has something
to do with the F41 fighter jet?

29:56.098 --> 29:57.491
I do.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.362
And the Russians' press release?

29:59.362 --> 30:01.887
Well, when Eileen forced Green
to publicly deny knowledge

30:01.887 --> 30:03.845
of Choi's whereabouts,
the Kremlin dropped

30:03.845 --> 30:06.065
the press release
to embarrass him.

30:06.065 --> 30:08.154
Presumably a negotiating tactic.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.764
Yeah.

30:09.764 --> 30:12.549
And now the Pentagon is blaming
the crash on pilot error.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.986
When in doubt,
blame the dead man.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.988
Yuna's reaching out to the Chois
to see how they feel

30:15.988 --> 30:17.728
about the Pentagon
scapegoating their son.

30:17.728 --> 30:18.904
Have you connected?

30:18.904 --> 30:20.557
Not yet. I will.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.559
All right. Let's get to it.

30:28.565 --> 30:29.871
Anything you want to say to me?

30:32.134 --> 30:33.701
Not now. No.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.964
Break big stories.
Make the paper relevant.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.226
Remember that speech?

30:38.227 --> 30:41.056
Even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.928
What you did was reckless.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.668
I got it, didn't I?

30:59.858 --> 31:02.643
Oh, geez. Oh.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.997
I found Hairy Potter.
Get in here.

31:08.997 --> 31:12.958
Oh, come here,
you stinky little wizard!

31:12.958 --> 31:14.960
I can't believe you found him.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.180
I'm redeemed! Thank you.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.182
Look at that.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.315
We had hope,
and hope prevailed.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.230
Maybe it's not so retro
after all.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.492
Look at you.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.407
Okay.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.061
I better take him right home
and come right back.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.062
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:30.062 --> 31:32.064
Ohh.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.282
Maybe something for the--

31:33.282 --> 31:35.284
The smell. I know.

31:35.284 --> 31:37.156
Oh, I kinda like your smell now.

31:44.859 --> 31:46.382
Roz Friendly.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.254
<i>Hi.</i>

31:48.254 --> 31:50.256
<i>You left a message for me?</i>

31:50.256 --> 31:52.040
<i>About Adam Barnett?</i>

31:52.040 --> 31:53.912
Who am I talking to?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.783
Liza Peters.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.960
I looked you up.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.658
You wrote about my friend
who went missing last year.

32:01.658 --> 32:04.923
<i>Paulina.
Only reason I called.</i>

32:04.923 --> 32:07.360
I thought maybe
I could trust you.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.927
You can.

32:11.755 --> 32:14.367
<i>What do you wanna know?</i>

32:14.367 --> 32:17.370
Have you had a sexual
relationship with Adam Barnett?

32:20.416 --> 32:22.505
<i>Liza?</i>

32:22.505 --> 32:25.247
Yeah. I did.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.597
<i>He promised me he'd hold
my neighbor accountable</i>

32:27.597 --> 32:29.991
<i>for what he did to me.</i>

32:29.991 --> 32:34.604
When we met, I thought someone
was finally gonna help.

32:34.604 --> 32:37.042
How did you end up dating him?

32:38.217 --> 32:40.654
<i>I slept with him that night.</i>

32:40.654 --> 32:43.831
<i>At the Lantern Inn.</i>

32:43.831 --> 32:47.704
<i>I wanted to then. I think.</i>

32:47.704 --> 32:50.229
Then I realized
it wasn't right, but...

32:52.535 --> 32:53.884
<i>But what?</i>

32:55.582 --> 32:59.151
I was worried that if
I stopped sleeping with him,

32:59.151 --> 33:01.414
he would drop the case
against my neighbor.

33:03.633 --> 33:06.288
Do you know if Adam has had
any other relationships

33:06.288 --> 33:09.683
with the victims
of the abusers he prosecutes?

33:09.683 --> 33:11.206
<i>I'm not the only one.</i>

33:54.423 --> 33:56.860
Please.
He can't defend himself.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.732
If you know anything, something...

34:33.506 --> 34:35.551
Hey, Corey, uh, any fallout
from the Russian announcement?

34:37.379 --> 34:40.687
Okay, yeah, I get it.
Yep, yep. Bye.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.472
It's locked down over there.
Brass is behind closed doors.

34:43.472 --> 34:46.214
I know what they're covering up.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.303
Two weeks ago,
Greg told his parents

34:48.303 --> 34:50.262
he sent an e-mail to commanding
officer Colonel Norton

34:50.262 --> 34:51.915
about problems with the F41.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.656
What kind of problems?

34:53.656 --> 34:55.267
The oxygen system.

34:55.267 --> 34:56.964
He said that he had
trouble breathing.

34:56.964 --> 34:59.227
And he told them the
"O2 concentrators seem

34:59.227 --> 35:01.142
to malfunction
when bumping heads."

35:01.142 --> 35:02.448
Bumping heads?

35:02.448 --> 35:03.884
Air combat maneuvers.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.407
Oh, they're trying to bury this.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.802
Yuna, reach out
to Colonel Norton for comment.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.804
Austin, call your PIO back.

35:10.804 --> 35:11.848
Try to get a comment.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.676
Are the parents on record?

35:15.069 --> 35:18.028
Yes. They are.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.996
- Taylor.
- What are you doing here?

35:28.996 --> 35:30.215
I have to fact-check
a couple things,

35:30.215 --> 35:31.955
and I thought that
this would be faster.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.479
I told you everything I know.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.830
Did Adam Barnett pressure you
to have sex with him?

35:39.267 --> 35:41.487
Promise he could put Ezra
in jail?

35:41.487 --> 35:45.055
Get you full custody of your son
if you slept together?

35:45.055 --> 35:47.232
What? No.
Did Ezra tell you that?

35:47.232 --> 35:50.148
How often did you
go to Adam's hotel room?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.715
None of your business.
I need to pick up my kid.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.500
You're not the only abuse victim

35:54.500 --> 35:56.197
he manipulated
into sleeping with him.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.637
So far, I know of seven.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.250
Why are you making this
about Adam?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.860
Ezra should be in jail.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.167
Okay, so, then, tell me--

36:09.167 --> 36:12.170
did Ezra ever mention
a Gloria Nanmac?

36:14.563 --> 36:17.566
Yeah, I heard about her.

36:17.566 --> 36:21.135
I know Ezra saw Gloria
at a friend's house

36:21.135 --> 36:22.528
the night she went missing.

36:24.007 --> 36:27.010
He told me
Gloria was still there

36:27.010 --> 36:29.361
when he went to get Jackson.

36:29.361 --> 36:31.885
My son said that they were
together the rest of the night.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.890
Do you think that Ezra
could have killed Gloria?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.417
He's not a good guy...

36:42.417 --> 36:44.202
but he didn't kill Gloria.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.260
Hey, Roz.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.914
Hey.

37:00.914 --> 37:04.134
I talked to Taylor.
I know why you're here.

37:04.134 --> 37:06.441
It's kind of disappointing,
to be honest.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.269
As disappointing
as you dating the victims

37:08.269 --> 37:09.749
of the abusers you prosecute?

37:09.749 --> 37:13.100
Look, I don't date victims.
I date women.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.145
Strong, complex,
wonderful women

37:15.145 --> 37:17.365
who I have devoted my life
to protecting.

37:17.365 --> 37:20.629
Sometimes that leads
to feelings for each other,

37:20.629 --> 37:22.805
and they deserve more, after
the guys they've been with.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.243
"More." That's you?

37:26.331 --> 37:29.247
Yeah. That's me.

37:30.596 --> 37:33.903
And anyway, I-I report every
relationship to my superiors.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.776
I'll be sure to ask them.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.737
Look, we have got
thousands of cases.

37:41.737 --> 37:45.088
I'm very good at what I do
because I care.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.786
Who's gonna care more than me?

37:46.786 --> 37:48.788
I'm going to be writing
a story that says

37:48.788 --> 37:50.833
you prey on the victims
in your cases,

37:50.833 --> 37:52.444
re-victimizing them

37:52.444 --> 37:54.533
by trapping them
in a relationship with you.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.231
You're totally wrong about me.
That's not true.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.450
Mm.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.975
You care to comment on my story?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.282
I just did.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.810
Another day.

38:10.810 --> 38:13.769
Safe to say finding Hairy
was the high point.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.858
Agreed.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.860
And just to say it, Bob,

38:17.860 --> 38:19.819
whatever's going on
with Colleen,

38:19.819 --> 38:21.211
you know we're all here for you.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.171
I appreciate that.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.390
Deeply.

38:29.437 --> 38:32.005
You know, I was thinking,

38:32.005 --> 38:34.486
this may be a good time
for us to get a dog.

38:34.486 --> 38:36.879
Dogs are great.

38:36.879 --> 38:37.837
Messy.

38:39.926 --> 38:41.449
But great.

38:43.146 --> 38:44.322
- Night, Claire.
- Night, Bob.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.635
Nine women now say
they had a sexual relationship

38:53.635 --> 38:57.335
with ADA Barnett while he was
prosecuting their abusers.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.945
He told me that he informed
the DA's office

38:58.945 --> 39:00.903
about the relationships.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.122
He was lying.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.384
What a scumbag.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.125
- Did you write it up?
- I did.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.996
And where does that leave us
with Ezra?

39:06.996 --> 39:09.782
His ex vouched for him.
Their son alibied him.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.175
Taylor believes the kid.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.003
Once you publish and
Barnett's behavior is out there,

39:14.003 --> 39:15.918
it's gonna taint
a lot of his cases.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.833
Yeah, and the current charges
against Ezra

39:17.833 --> 39:20.053
are probably gonna get dropped.

39:23.404 --> 39:26.059
I'll follow up on Ezra's claim
that Gloria was looking for Oxy

39:26.059 --> 39:28.583
the night she went missing,
see if anyone got busted

39:28.583 --> 39:31.020
for selling prescription meds
after she disappeared.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.935
Yeah. Good work.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.376
How's it feel?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.029
What?

39:40.029 --> 39:41.770
Facing up to your boogeyman?

39:41.770 --> 39:43.381
It felt good.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.209
It'll feel even better
when I take him down.

39:46.209 --> 39:49.561
Night.

39:54.827 --> 39:57.438
<i>Tonight, the
Pentagon is refuting claims</i>

39:57.438 --> 40:01.311

40:01.311 --> 40:03.836

<i>Defense Secretary Green...</i>

40:23.072 --> 40:25.640
What are you doing?

40:25.640 --> 40:27.773
I texted a few times,
and you didn't answer, so...

40:27.773 --> 40:29.252
I just came down.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.385
Do you usually show up
at people's doors

40:31.385 --> 40:32.952
who don't return your texts?

40:32.952 --> 40:35.258
Just people I want to see.

40:35.258 --> 40:37.435
Or who have a habit
of passing out.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.567
- Okay, well, you saw me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:39.567 --> 40:43.441
I didn't get to say
what I came here to say.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.573
Okay.

40:48.228 --> 40:50.143
What you did today was...

40:51.710 --> 40:53.015
...impressive.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.497
Well, if you promise not to tell
Bob, it was also reckless.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.151
I didn't know if I was right.

40:58.151 --> 41:00.806
Yeah, no,
that was pretty clear.

41:00.806 --> 41:04.157
But I guess that is
what makes you different.

41:06.986 --> 41:10.119
All right, well, since you're
clogging up my door, tell me.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.425
What makes you different?

41:12.774 --> 41:16.691
That answer may--
may require a drink.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.867
You have to work up the courage?

41:18.867 --> 41:20.956
Maybe.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.959
Courage first. Drink later.

41:23.959 --> 41:27.223
Now's your chance.
Don't blow it.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.182
What makes you different?

41:47.809 --> 41:51.552
That's a good kiss.

41:51.552 --> 41:53.772
But it can't happen again.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.383
Now or ever.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.691
Yeah.

41:59.691 --> 42:01.214
Understood.
