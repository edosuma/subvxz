NARRATOR: Previously
on Heartland.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.213
 Oh, Lou.

00:05.338 --> 00:06.589
Before you go, you got to give
me the details on this wedding.

00:06.715 --> 00:07.924
 Peter was supposed
to fly out tonight,

00:08.048 --> 00:09.342
but we have this
deal to work out now.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.719
 So he's going to
be at the wedding?

00:10.844 --> 00:11.636
 What about the wedding?

00:11.761 --> 00:13.346
 Forget the wedding.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.974
 You know that job in
BC, you should take it.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.642
Lyndy is in a routine now.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.394
We'll be fine.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.771
 Jack, this is my
sister-in-law Jen.

00:21.896 --> 00:22.897
 Pleasure to meet you, Jen.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
I'm real sorry about your loss.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.026
 Thank you.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.193
 I do need our talks.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.695
And I need your hugs.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.906
And I need to know that
you're beside me at night.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.742
Maybe I could move in with you?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.995
 That's sounds terrific.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.206
[music playing]

01:33.093 --> 01:33.885
 Come on, mom.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.887
Let's go.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.722
 Wow, look who it is.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.598
Oh.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.641
Boy.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.980
Did I ever miss you.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.148
[baby crying]
- Shh.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.775
OK.
Lyndy.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.859
I'm right here.

01:49.984 --> 01:50.819
Yes.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.278
It's OK.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.657
Mommy can't wash her
hair, but that's OK.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.950
Ouch.

01:57.075 --> 01:57.784
Hello?

01:57.909 --> 01:58.785
Yes.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.869
This is Amy.

01:59.994 --> 02:00.829
Shh.
No.

02:00.954 --> 02:01.788
Not you.

02:01.913 --> 02:02.914
Ah.

02:03.039 --> 02:03.957
Actually, can I call you back?

02:04.082 --> 02:04.833
That would be great.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.750
Thank you.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.043
Bye.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.669
You're OK.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.088
You're OK.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.006
 All right.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.215
Two specials.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.258
 Thank you.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.175
 Thank you.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.594
 And one burger.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.721
Is that right?

02:17.846 --> 02:18.680
No onions.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.681
 Say, thank you.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.437
 Hey.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.479
Thanks for helping me out.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.272
 Oh.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.773
I don't mind.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.025
That means I get to
spend more time with you.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.484
 Yeah.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.610
How's it going over
there at casa Casey's?

02:32.736 --> 02:33.987
Are they bursting at the seams?

02:34.112 --> 02:37.323
 It's a little crowded,
but we're managing.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.827
 Well, you can always stay
at Big River, any time.

02:40.952 --> 02:41.703
 Thank you.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.620
 Thanks.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.705
 We're OK though.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.123
I would love
everybody to come over

02:45.248 --> 02:46.458
to Heartland for dinner though.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.834
 OK.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.502
 I think, you'll get a
little sick of my cooking.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.879
 OK.
I'll ask Jack.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.047
And Lou.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.007
 Lou?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.216
Lou's home?

02:55.342 --> 02:56.593
 Why do you say it like that?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.763
 Well, just with Maggie's
and the dude ranch

02:59.888 --> 03:03.433
and the rodeo school, just
have so much on your plate

03:03.558 --> 03:04.976
now thanks to her.

03:05.101 --> 03:09.606
 And I don't have enough
time for what's important?

03:09.731 --> 03:10.648
Ah.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.817
Just a second.

03:12.942 --> 03:13.777
It's Caleb.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.070
I got to take this.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.029
Please?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.697
 Yeah.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.407
 Yeah.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.367
 Whoa.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.618
What's all this?

03:21.743 --> 03:22.535
 Oh.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.204
Just some of Lisa's things.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.205
 Lisa's things?

03:25.330 --> 03:26.748
 Yeah.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.333
Didn't I mention we
decided to live together.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.377
 Lisa's moving in?

03:30.502 --> 03:31.878
After all this time?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.088
 Yeah.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.215
 Why didn't she tell me?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.716
 Well, it happened pretty fast.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.218
 Oh.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.595
So fast you didn't mention
it on our last phone call.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.346
 Hey.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.722
 Hey, you're back.

03:42.847 --> 03:43.640
 Oh.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.809
God I missed you so much.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.103
 And I got you a
present from New York.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.938
 Why don't you go get
it out of your backpack?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.356
 Cool.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.024
I'd love to stay and
catch up, but I've

03:53.149 --> 03:53.983
got a shift at the diner.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.110
Tim wants me to help out.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.861
 Why don't I drive you?

03:56.986 --> 03:59.197
And I can tell you all about
our summer plans on the way.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.616
 Well, it might be easier
if I just drive myself.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.785
I've got my license
now, remember?

04:03.910 --> 04:06.079
 Right.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.081
 The truck?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.207
- Keys are in it.
- Ah.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.417
Thank you.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.127
 You bring it
back in one piece.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.963
[music playing]

04:16.880 --> 04:18.382
 What was so important
I had to drop everything

04:18.507 --> 04:19.926
to come over here.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.386
 I bought some new broncs
for the rodeo school.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.138
Don't worry, I got a great deal.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.807
 You bought broncs for my rodeo
school without consulting me.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.975
 Yeah.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.852
I take this job very seriously.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.438
I knew you were in the market,
so I took the initiative.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.981
Can't wait to see them.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.233
They were a third of the
price if you bought all six.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.902
 Six?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.864
[horses neighing]

04:40.989 --> 04:42.198
 Come on.
Come on.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.122
 Come around.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.624
Come around.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.501
 I see why you got them
for a third of the price.

of day you sink into a dream,

You dreamer.

You dreamer.

 What do you
think you're doing?

05:41.466 --> 05:43.051
We can't keep these things.

 What do you expect me to do?

I didn't know they were
miniature when I ordered them.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.596
 Send them back.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.806
Get a refund.
I don't care.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.057
Fix it.

 I don't think it's
going to be that easy.

 No room for cute
at my rodeo school.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.159

 I know, big step.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.579
 Tell me about it.

You two have always
been so adamant

06:13.123 --> 06:14.624
about your independence.

I didn't think living together
was even on the table.

you working on?

You just got here.

take over running Maggie's

06:27.220 --> 06:29.347

I'm working in New York.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.932
 Well, that's a good idea.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.601
 Does that mean you're
going to be away even more?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.478
I know Georgie is
good at hiding it,

06:35.603 --> 06:37.397
but she really misses
having you around.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.398
 Don't worry, Grandpa.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.983
I have a plan for that too.

I need a shower.

You know, she swoops
in from New York

06:55.040 --> 06:56.875
like nothing's changed
with all these big plans,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.002
like what are they
going to be this time?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.588
She just forgets that I
have a life now, you know,

07:01.713 --> 07:03.923
with work and Flame, friends.

07:04.049 --> 07:04.924
 Yeah.
I know.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.134
I totally get that.

It's like my stepmom.

When my dad was sick, she'd
just like take care of him 24/7.

And now that he's
gone, she doesn't

07:19.022 --> 07:20.982
know what to do with
her life, so she's

07:21.107 --> 07:24.027
like obsessed with mine.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.695
She really needs to
get one of her own.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.072
 I'd be careful
what you wish for.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.615
I used to think
Lou needed a life.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.616
And now she has one.

07:29.741 --> 07:33.036
And I never see her.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.162
 Sorry, I'm late.

 It's all right.

What was the big emergency?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.337
He bought broncs for
the rodeo school.

 What's wrong with that?

07:45.006 --> 07:46.633
 They're three feet tall.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.177
 What's three feet tall?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.013
 Caleb bought horses
for the rodeo school.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.264
 Minis?
Oh.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.307
They're so sweet.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.183
 They're not sweet.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.309
They're short.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.727
And they're nasty and useless.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.020
And he better be taking
them back as we speak.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.692
Lou is not home yet, is she?

08:03.817 --> 08:04.609
 Yeah.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.694
She got home a while ago.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.153
 I thought I had
a couple hours.

ranch before she sees it.

- Dad?
- Welcome.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.924
 Dad?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.718
I thought you were
looking after this place.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.970
 I opened up the
cabins for the guests

08:32.095 --> 08:34.222
that you booked, you
know, a few weeks ago.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.725
But I have not been
back a lot since.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.351
 There have been no
guests since then?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.519
 No.
Ah.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.352
I've been busy.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.147
Not really.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.399
 I was going to hire
a full time manager

08:44.524 --> 08:45.775
but there's nothing to manage.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.278
I mean, this is an
overgrown ghost town.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.988
 Well, you're home.

08:50.113 --> 08:55.326
You're home now, have the place
back shipshape in no time.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.537
And I guess you heard
about the Mitch situation.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.747
Not my idea.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.749
Jack wanted to bring him back.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.542
His trailer's up there.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.669
But I made sure they
put it out of sight,

09:04.794 --> 09:09.924
so got your back on that.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.260
 What?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.720
 Yeah.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.347
I probably should have
mentioned that Mitch

09:15.472 --> 09:17.015
was back here working again.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.808
 Why?

09:18.933 --> 09:21.895
 I made him a partner
in our cattle business.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.772
 A partner?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.857
Grandpa, how could you?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.233
And without talking
to me about it first?

09:27.359 --> 09:28.735
 OK.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.695
As far as I can tell,
you're not going to be

09:30.820 --> 09:32.697
around here that much anymore.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.240
Isn't that what you
were just saying?

09:34.366 --> 09:35.450
 Yes.
But--

09:35.575 --> 09:36.951
 Well, then I
guess this decision,

09:37.077 --> 09:41.956
really, won't affect
you that much, will it?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.042
 So Ty's gone.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.502
Lisa's moved in.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.630
And you've hired
my ex-boyfriend.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.548
Anything else you
forgot to mention?

09:50.674 --> 09:51.591
 No.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.302
That pretty much covers it.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.012
 Oh, she looks bigger.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.765
 Ty, she's the exact same size
as when you left two days ago.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.225
How are things going there?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.811
 Bob and I worked on
five wolves yesterday.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.230
All shot from the air.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.898
Just left to suffer.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.860
We-- we lost two of them.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.278
 Well, at least
you're helping, right?

10:12.404 --> 10:13.154
 Yeah.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.823
I guess.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.324
 I'm so proud of you.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.243
 Thanks, Amy.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.119
Amy, I got to go.

10:19.244 --> 10:19.994
Bob's here.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.287
So I'll talk to you soon, OK?

10:21.413 --> 10:22.330
 OK.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.248
Call me later.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.416
 Will do.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.583
Bye, sweetheart.

10:25.709 --> 10:26.501
 Bye.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.294
Say, bye, daddy.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.254
Bye.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.505
Bye, Lyndy.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.175
[music playing]

10:41.599 --> 10:44.019
 I thought I told you to
get rid of these things.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.478
 I can't.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.646
 Why?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.314
 Truth is I bought them online.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.734
I contacted the seller, and
he's a reasonable guy, but--

10:50.859 --> 10:52.027
 Yeah.
But, basically, you're screwed.

10:52.152 --> 10:52.944
 Yes.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.029
Yes, I am.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.489
 Can I play with
your horses, Caleb?

10:56.614 --> 10:57.741
 No, Katie.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.701
Honey, we're not
keeping these horses.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.202
 I don't see that
we have much choice.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.787
 Well, you're going
to have to sell them.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.080
And hopefully,
you'll find somebody

11:04.205 --> 11:06.416
dumber than you to buy them.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.542
[katie screaming]

11:07.667 --> 11:08.501

11:13.506 --> 11:16.676
 That was fun.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.969
 These guys aren't
like your pony.

11:18.094 --> 11:18.887
They buck.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.139
 I know.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.390
 You know what?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.601
You're lucky she's got my genes.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.644
She could have been hurt.

 Hey, Tim.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.814
Having a brainwave.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.232
 Keep it to yourself.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.150
 Come on, Tim.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.610
Just hear me out.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.695
All we have to do is postpone
the saddle bronc clinic

11:35.820 --> 11:38.239
with the older kids, I'll get
some of their younger brothers

11:38.365 --> 11:39.741
and sisters to
come out, and we'll

11:39.866 --> 11:41.034
have a session with the minis.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.077
 No.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.495
No way.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.246
I've already worked with
kids, with Little Britches,

11:45.372 --> 11:46.581
I'm not doing it again.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.416
 Yeah.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.001
But these kids will be like
nine or 10, way more manageable.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.628
 Katie, cover your ears.

11:51.753 --> 11:55.465
Working with kids is a
nightmare, even the older ones.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.759
You add some miniature
broncs to the equation,

11:57.884 --> 11:58.760
you've got a recipe
for disaster.

11:58.885 --> 11:59.886
 Come on, Tim.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.846
Just let me run the clinic.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.807
If it doesn't work
out, it'll be on me.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.225
That's fine.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.060
Listen, it's a whole
new revenue stream.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.315
 Fine.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.694
One clinic, but you're
running the whole thing.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.405
I am not involved.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.447
I love you.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.448
Go to the house.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.117
 You won't regret this.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.076
 I already do.

12:23.201 --> 12:23.910
 Oh.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.245
Just one more thing.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.247
Can I borrow a
few hundred bucks?

12:27.372 --> 12:29.708
I got to board the minis
at the rodeo grounds.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.625
 Keep them here.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.878
[music playing]

12:45.223 --> 12:47.058
 OK.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.309
 I'm going to be a bronc rider.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.269
 Really?

12:49.394 --> 12:50.311
Since when?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.187
 Since Caleb.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.272
He let me ride one today.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.773
 Oh.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.442
Well, I don't know if we're
going to have time for that

12:55.567 --> 12:58.319
because you have to help
Mommy to find a new manager.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.362
 Mitch!

12:59.487 --> 13:00.238
 Are you kidding me?

13:00.363 --> 13:01.448
No, thank you.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.283
 Hey, kiddo.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.242
How are you?

13:06.745 --> 13:07.746
Hi.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.622
 I'll be inside, Mommy.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.250
Bye, Mitch.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.336
 Hi?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.670
I called you.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.755
I texted you.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.548
I Facebooked you.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.924
No response.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.634
And that's what you
have to say to me?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.178
Hi?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.471
 Lou, I don't know what to say.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.639
This is really awkward.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.351
 Not as awkward
as thinking you're

13:29.476 --> 13:32.479
in a relationship with someone
and showing up at their trailer

13:32.604 --> 13:34.314
and discovering
they've disappeared

13:34.439 --> 13:35.315
with no explanation.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.568
 No explanation?

13:38.693 --> 13:39.527
OK.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.321
How about this?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.198
How about I show up at the
wedding that you invited me to,

13:43.323 --> 13:44.866
only to see you and your
ex run off together.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.659
 I did not run off with my ex.

13:46.785 --> 13:47.702
 I saw you with my own eyes.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.204
You held hands.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.455
You got in the truck,
and you you drove off.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.498
 Amy was in labor.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.710
 How was I supposed
to know that?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.962
 If you had stuck around,
you could have found out.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.634
 Can we just--

14:02.759 --> 14:04.135
can we just put this behind us.

Please?

14:05.637 --> 14:06.388
I'm working for Jack again.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.681
 Yeah.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.057
Thanks for the heads
up on that, by the way.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.728
And you know, just
because you're back,

14:13.853 --> 14:16.564
does not mean things are going
to return to the way they were.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.274
I've moved on.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.569
 This might be hard for you
to wrap your head around.

- Sorry.

 What's all this?

14:50.932 --> 14:52.100
 Oh.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.935
It's just requirements
for the job.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.562
 It's a pretty big ask.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.980
 Not really.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.857
I obviously should
have done it sooner.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.275
I can't believe
the way that my dad

15:00.400 --> 15:02.235
has neglected the dude ranch.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.529
He really dropped the ball.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.447
 Don't blame him.

He's trying his best.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.575

It's just been really hard
since you've been away so much.

 I know.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.621
And it's been hard for me too.

But that's why I came up
with the perfect plan.

 Plan?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.460
 Yeah.

York has been a total success.

join us, just for the summer.

into transporting Flame.

 Oh.
Come on.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.767
That's ridiculous.

shipped out too.

you that she fired me.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.480
 What?

Maggie's or the dude ranch

Maggie's for later today.

17:54.657 --> 17:55.533
 Hey.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.785
 Hey.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.370
 I hope you don't mind
me working in here.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.163
A whole new load
of Lisa's boxes is

18:00.288 --> 18:01.623
taking up the entire kitchen.
- Yeah.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.582
It's fine.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.250
 Where's Lyndy?

18:04.376 --> 18:07.003
 She finally went
down for her nap.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.963
 You know, Amy, the first
rule of having a baby

18:09.089 --> 18:10.048
is when they nap, you nap.

18:10.173 --> 18:11.049
 Yeah.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.425
Well, I can't nap, Lou.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.427
I'm trying to build
back my client base.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.096
I'm not going to do that
if I'm sleeping all day.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.055
 Can't do everything.

18:17.180 --> 18:17.972
You're going to burn out.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.432
 Yeah.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.267
I don't really have
a choice now, do I?

18:21.393 --> 18:23.478
 You know, Amy, having
it all is a myth.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.397
 I don't want it all, Lou.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.482
That sounds more like you.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.817
 What?

18:28.942 --> 18:30.360
 Why would you ask
Georgie to move to New York

18:30.485 --> 18:32.195
when you know she's in
the middle of training.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.988
 I'll talk to Val.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.448
We'll take Flame with us.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.449
 No.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.118
Val's not going to go for that.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.911
Flame just overcame
a huge trauma.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.497
You can't just pack him up
and ship him 2000 miles.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.456
 I had no idea.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.165
 Yeah.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.166
Of course, you didn't.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.876
 I'm doing my best, OK?

18:47.002 --> 18:48.503
I'm trying to be a good mom.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.880
 You can't do three months
of parenting in three days.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.757
 That's not fair.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.300
 I'm not going to
stand here and tell you

18:54.426 --> 18:56.052
how to raise your
family, but you

18:56.177 --> 18:58.722
can't expect Georgie to
choose between showjumping

18:58.847 --> 18:59.681
and her mom.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.057
That's not being fair.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.767
 Why don't you stick to
worrying about your daughter.

19:02.892 --> 19:03.685
And I'll worry about mine.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.602
 Fine.

19:04.728 --> 19:05.520
 Fine.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.148
[music playing]

19:13.820 --> 19:15.613
 Hey, dad.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.532
 Hi, honey.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.827
 Hey, I'm supposed to remember
to ask you if Casey and her

19:20.952 --> 19:23.329
sister-in-law and the two
boys can come for dinner

19:23.455 --> 19:24.998
tomorrow night at the ranch.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.833
 Didn't she just
lose her husband?

19:26.958 --> 19:27.709
 Yeah.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.710
Yeah.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.544
She's-- she's OK.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.295
 Yeah.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.838
I mean, of course.

19:31.963 --> 19:32.797
I don't see why not.

19:32.922 --> 19:33.798
 Good.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.889
What exactly are you
looking for in a person?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.516
 Well, there are a lot
of qualified people.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.852
But if working in New York
has taught me anything,

19:45.977 --> 19:48.688
it's that I want to find someone
who can think outside the box.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.151
I'm just going to ask you
a number of questions.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.611
There is no right answer.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.029
 OK.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.822
 If you could have dinner
with any three people,

19:57.947 --> 19:59.741
living or dead,
who would they be?

19:59.866 --> 20:07.082
 Probably Heathcliff,
Frodo, and Mittens.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.833
Well, they're my cats.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.419
And they're not human per se,
but I wouldn't want to have

20:11.544 --> 20:12.629
dinner with anybody else.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.297
 If there was a
color that would

20:14.422 --> 20:16.800
best describe your management
style, what would that be?

20:16.925 --> 20:18.051
- Red.
- Great.

20:18.176 --> 20:18.927
 No.

20:19.052 --> 20:19.928
Wait.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.763
Pink.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.848
Yellow?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.183
 OK, good.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.601
 Chartreuse.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.561
It's the only color
that is also a drink.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.522
 If there were a
tree that would best

20:30.647 --> 20:32.607
describe your management style.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.608
 Great question.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.488
 Like just a little shrub.

20:38.613 --> 20:42.409
 I would go with
pinus banksiana.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.119
It's jack pine for
you lay-people.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.745
 And why did you choose that?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.247
 I think, it's pretty
self-explanatory.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.748
 Sorry.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.625
Can we go back to the
question about colors?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.836
Because I feel like you were
judging me for saying yellow.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.630
And my management style
is more of an orange,

20:55.755 --> 20:58.550
like it's closer to marigold.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.135
 It's not like I
can't communicate.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.469
I mean, I'm a
great communicator.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.971
- Good.
- Just that's my cats.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.612
 I know my interview was an
hour ago, but I'm new in town.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.614
And I had to get somebody to
look after my youngest son.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.450
 I'm sorry, but
punctuality is actually

21:23.575 --> 21:25.201
pretty important to me, so--

21:25.326 --> 21:26.911
 I'm usually not this flaky.

21:27.037 --> 21:32.334
 Well, flaky is definitely
not a plus for this position.

to be much longer?

Hmm.

my teeth and go to bed.

21:56.941 --> 21:57.567
 OK.

21:57.692 --> 22:00.320
I'm doing something.

on my mini broncs.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.477
 I saw those little guys.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.437
I hear there is a
bit of a mix up.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.314
I'm sure my dad loved that.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.399
 You have no idea.

22:39.901 --> 22:43.029
And I stupidly volunteered
to teach a clinic.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.823
The older kids, I get them.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.658
Some of them, they
even look up to me.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.370
But the little ones,
completely uncharted

22:50.495 --> 22:52.831
territory and way over my head.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.170
Wait a minute.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.880
You have tons of experience
with mini horses.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.757
And I know you helped Tim
with that whole mutton busting

slept in 24 hours.

 OK.

23:13.018 --> 23:13.810
OK.

But this is like
a huge screw up.

I really need to prove to
Tim that this can work.

Please, you've got to help me.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.109
 I can't.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.111
I have limited time right now.

23:28.575 --> 23:34.372
 I will buy you and Ty dinner
out, once a week for a month.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.124
And I'll babysit.

 I don't care how
long you two have

been together, living under the
same roof is just different.

 Oh.

All the candidates were
completely maladjusted.

harder than I thought.

You talked to her
about New York?

24:23.713 --> 24:25.215
 Well, we haven't ironed
out the details yet,

24:25.340 --> 24:27.717
but I've been so busy
since I've been back,

24:27.842 --> 24:29.511
I haven't had much time
for Georgie and Katie.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.595

of what's important here, Lou.

Jack made me a good offer.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.242
And I like working with him.

26:16.368 --> 26:17.202
 It's fine.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.912
I'm over it.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.413
 And the reason that I haven't
answered any of your calls

26:20.538 --> 26:21.915
or text is because--

26:22.040 --> 26:24.626
well it-- it's because
I was tired of not

26:24.751 --> 26:26.086
knowing where we stood.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.421
 Mitch, I'm pretty
sure you and I both knew

26:28.546 --> 26:30.256
exactly where we stood.

26:30.382 --> 26:31.591
 Really?

26:31.716 --> 26:32.842
And where does Peter fit in?

26:32.967 --> 26:34.469
 I already told you.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.930
I didn't want to lose
everything I had worked for.

26:37.055 --> 26:41.101
And Peter's investment
offer was the easy answer.

26:41.226 --> 26:44.437
You should know,
I turned him down.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.730

Your dad might have
mentioned that.

a different investor.

could have told you that.

27:52.255 --> 27:53.631
If you were going to
wash it, I'm pretty

27:53.757 --> 27:55.383
sure you'd done it by now.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.885
 Well, I got distracted.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.345
I had to help Katie get ready.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.971
I didn't realize it
was such a big deal.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.057
 Well, if you don't
at least rinse it,

28:02.182 --> 28:05.518
it gets all caked on there,
and it's impossible to get off.

28:05.643 --> 28:06.728
 OK.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.355
Well, that won't happen again.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.190
It kind of pales in comparison
to the pile of wet towels

28:10.315 --> 28:11.858
on the bed every morning, but--

28:11.983 --> 28:14.194
 Well, I would put the
wet towels in the bathroom

28:14.319 --> 28:15.612
if I could ever get in there.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.613
 OK.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.073
 All right.

28:18.198 --> 28:21.409
 I put extra diapers
in here just in case.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.244
You guys are still OK
to watch Lyndy, right?

28:23.370 --> 28:24.871
 Oh.
You bet.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.581
 Did you not tell Caleb you'd
be at the grounds by 10:00?

28:26.706 --> 28:27.582
 Yeah.
Why?

28:27.707 --> 28:28.583
What time is it?

28:28.708 --> 28:29.876
 It's well after that.

28:30.001 --> 28:31.002
 He is going to kill me.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.337
 OK.
You guys are good?

28:32.462 --> 28:33.380
Thank you.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.303
 OK, guys.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.305
Now that we've had a little warm
up, it's time to get started.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.099
First step to
becoming a bronc rider

28:44.224 --> 28:45.892
is getting familiar with
this guy right here.

28:46.017 --> 28:47.310
 That's baby stuff.

28:47.435 --> 28:48.728
When do we get to
ride the real horses?

28:48.853 --> 28:49.938
 No.
No.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.481
You're not ready
for real horses yet.

28:51.606 --> 28:53.191
 I want to ride
the mini broncs.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.818
 Mini broncs.

28:54.943 --> 28:56.736
Mini broncs.

28:56.861 --> 28:58.571
Mini broncs.

28:58.697 --> 28:59.614
Mini broncs.

28:59.739 --> 29:00.824
 OK.
Yeah.

29:00.949 --> 29:01.991
Fine.
Yeah.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.576
We'll start with
the mini broncs.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.412
[kids cheering]

29:05.537 --> 29:06.371
Yay.

Where were you?

30:04.763 --> 30:06.348
 Where is everyone?

30:06.473 --> 30:07.640
Did I miss it?

30:07.766 --> 30:10.018
 Well, you missed something.

30:10.143 --> 30:15.315
 Caleb, I'm sure
it wasn't that bad.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.858
 I had to shut it
down and call it a day

30:16.983 --> 30:19.069
before things got worse.

30:19.194 --> 30:20.862
 Oh.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.531
Sorry I couldn't be here sooner.

30:23.656 --> 30:24.949
 I totally screwed up.

30:25.075 --> 30:26.534
And clinic was a bonehead idea.

30:30.580 --> 30:31.456
 What can I do to help?

30:34.334 --> 30:36.044
 I think we just need
to take a step back.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.548
 It was bad.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.926
You know, I'm not even sure
the word bad does it justice.

30:43.051 --> 30:46.388
But Caleb has now given me five
different reasons to fire him,

30:46.513 --> 30:47.472
I just have to pick one.

30:47.597 --> 30:48.682
 Come on, Dad.

30:48.807 --> 30:49.557
Can't you at least
support Caleb?

30:49.683 --> 30:51.142
He's actually trying.

30:51.267 --> 30:52.977
 I'm not handing out
participation medals though.

30:53.103 --> 30:53.853
Amy, this is my business.

30:53.978 --> 30:55.689
 Yeah.

30:55.814 --> 30:58.358
But what's good for Caleb, is
good for your business, right?

30:58.483 --> 31:00.485
 But Lou is now hiring
somebody for Maggie's

31:00.610 --> 31:02.320
and the dude ranch,
so I can spend

31:02.445 --> 31:04.823
more time with my students
at the rodeo school.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.282
I don't need Caleb anymore.

31:06.408 --> 31:07.826
 Well, don't hand
out his pink slip yet.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.744
I'm nowhere near
finding a new one.

31:09.869 --> 31:10.704
 Hey.

31:10.829 --> 31:11.663
Come on in.

31:11.788 --> 31:12.580
Welcome.

31:13.957 --> 31:14.749
 Hey.

31:14.874 --> 31:15.750
 Hey, Lou.

31:15.875 --> 31:16.710
These are my nephews.

31:16.835 --> 31:17.669
This is Wyatt and Brick.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.462
 Hi, guys.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.089
 And this is my
sister-in-law Jen.

31:21.214 --> 31:22.257
Jen, this is Lou.

31:24.843 --> 31:26.511
 Actually, we've met.

31:26.636 --> 31:29.014
[music playing]

31:30.682 --> 31:31.975
 OK.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.561
I have a question
for Jack and Lisa.

31:34.686 --> 31:37.605
How's it going so far living
together for the first time?

31:41.568 --> 31:42.360
That good, huh?

31:42.485 --> 31:43.778
 Yeah.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.321
 What about you?

31:45.447 --> 31:46.489
You found anyone for
Maggie's and the dude ranch?

31:46.614 --> 31:47.907
 Oh.

31:48.033 --> 31:48.950
I highly doubt that
Lou's going to find

31:49.075 --> 31:50.660
anyone that meets her criteria.

31:50.785 --> 31:53.705
 Oh, and the questions
she's asking, the interviews.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.915
What color would you compare
your management style to?

31:56.041 --> 32:00.045
 Or name the tree that best
describes your personality?

32:00.170 --> 32:03.715
 I don't see what
colors or trees have

32:03.840 --> 32:05.633
to do with running a business.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.344
 I don't know about that, Jack.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.636
I kind of think that that
reveals a lot about a person.

32:08.762 --> 32:10.430
Like say, what kind
of tree would you be?

32:10.555 --> 32:11.973
Someone might say
oak if they're trying

32:12.098 --> 32:14.142
to convey strength,
or maybe pine

32:14.267 --> 32:16.227
or spruce if they're outdoorsy.

32:16.353 --> 32:17.645
Me personally, I
would be a palm tree

32:17.771 --> 32:19.647
because I can go with
the flow and survive

32:19.773 --> 32:21.483
in any kind of condition.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.318
Another really great
one that you could ask

32:23.443 --> 32:26.863
is, if you were a superhero,
what superpower would you have?

32:26.988 --> 32:28.448
I used to ask that
one all the time

32:28.573 --> 32:30.658
when I was hiring for a B&B
I used to run after college.

32:30.784 --> 32:33.495
[music playing]

32:34.454 --> 32:35.955
 Do you think--

32:36.081 --> 32:37.582
wouldn't Jen be perfect to run
a Maggie's and the dude ranch?

32:37.707 --> 32:39.292
 Oh.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.419
Lou, you already know how I
feel about this whole thing.

32:41.544 --> 32:42.420
 I know, Grandpa.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.630
And I get it.

32:43.755 --> 32:45.632
But, I mean, think about it.

32:45.757 --> 32:48.009
You were away on the rodeo
circuit all the time,

32:48.134 --> 32:49.761
and mom turned out just fine.

32:49.886 --> 32:52.764
Dad was away all the time,
and we turned out just fine.

32:52.889 --> 32:54.474
 Away all the time?

32:54.599 --> 32:56.142
I thought once the
new Maggie's was open,

32:56.267 --> 32:57.894
you'd be home for good.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.313
 Georgie, you have to
understand, it's a franchise.

33:00.438 --> 33:01.064
 Yeah.

33:01.189 --> 33:02.357
It's a franchise.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.527
So you open up another
one and another.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.362
 It has come up.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.030
There is the potential for that.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.116
I mean, success breeds success.

33:11.241 --> 33:12.992
 Are you serious?

33:13.118 --> 33:15.203
So, basically,
you'll never be home.

33:15.328 --> 33:16.913
You might as well hire a
new mom while you're at it.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.123
 Come on, Georgie.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.207
We're going to
spend lots of time

33:19.332 --> 33:20.750
together this
summer in New York.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.085
 No.

33:22.210 --> 33:23.712
No, we're not because
I'm not going.

33:23.837 --> 33:26.715
[music playing]

33:31.553 --> 33:32.679
 OK.

33:32.804 --> 33:36.016
Yesterday did not
exactly go as planned.

33:36.141 --> 33:38.143
I have a surprise for you today.

33:38.268 --> 33:39.227
 Hey, guys.

33:39.352 --> 33:41.479
 This is my friend Amy.

33:41.604 --> 33:44.649
 So Caleb tells me that you
tried the real deal yesterday.

33:44.774 --> 33:46.609
How'd that go?

33:46.735 --> 33:48.153
Not so good, huh?

33:48.278 --> 33:49.779
Well, that's OK.

33:49.904 --> 33:51.698
Maybe you're not ready for
the wild ponies just yet,

33:51.823 --> 33:53.199
but we'll get there.

33:53.324 --> 33:56.578
First, I thought we could
practice on this one.

33:56.703 --> 33:57.871
She's nice and quiet.

33:57.996 --> 33:58.705
Does that sound good?

33:58.830 --> 33:59.664
OK.

33:59.789 --> 34:01.124
Great.

34:01.249 --> 34:02.751
Hey, Katie, why don't
you come on over here.

34:02.876 --> 34:04.210
This is my niece Katie.

34:04.336 --> 34:05.837
And I thought that she
could help demonstrate how

34:05.962 --> 34:07.255
to properly sit in the saddle.

34:07.380 --> 34:09.841
And we'll get into a bit
of a spurring motion.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.592
Good job.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.679
[music playing]

34:25.815 --> 34:26.565
 Yeah.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.568
Hi.

34:28.693 --> 34:30.320
I made a little work
area for myself.

34:30.445 --> 34:33.614
 And this is my
fly-fishing desk.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.116
I tie flies here.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.034
Where is my fishing stuff?

34:37.159 --> 34:38.620
 It's all right here.

34:38.745 --> 34:39.661
I put it in this box.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.164
 Oh.

34:41.289 --> 34:43.458
You can't just cram it
into a box like that.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.293
You've got to keep it separate.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.835
- OK.
- Oh.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.962
See.

34:48.088 --> 34:49.880
You'll never untangle that mess.

34:50.005 --> 34:50.799
 I said, I'm sorry.

34:53.885 --> 34:55.594
Boy, I can't do anything
right around here.

34:55.719 --> 34:59.057
 I just can't believe
that you move my fishing

34:59.182 --> 35:01.101
stuff without asking me.

35:01.226 --> 35:03.061
 Jack, I got it.

35:03.186 --> 35:03.978
Said I was sorry.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.647
You know what?

35:05.772 --> 35:06.940
Kind of get the feeling that
maybe we rushed into this

35:07.065 --> 35:08.441
living together thing.

35:08.566 --> 35:09.609
And if you want to pull
the plug, you just say so.

35:09.734 --> 35:12.654
 Who said anything
about pulling the plug?

35:12.779 --> 35:14.698
 Well, you're
obviously not happy.

35:14.823 --> 35:16.324
All you're doing
is picking at me.

35:19.035 --> 35:21.496
 Lisa, I'm sorry.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.835
I'm sorry if you
think I'm nagging

35:26.960 --> 35:30.839
or if I've made you feel
anything other than welcome

35:30.964 --> 35:32.132
here.

35:32.257 --> 35:33.967
I'm not used to
sharing the space

35:34.092 --> 35:35.468
with anybody but the girls.

35:35.593 --> 35:39.848
And it's-- it's an adjustment.

35:39.973 --> 35:40.849
 Yes.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.350
Yes it is.

35:42.475 --> 35:45.603
 But we'll make it work.

35:45.729 --> 35:46.688
 Sure we will.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.484
 It's good.

her knees are?

35:52.944 --> 35:53.862
That's perfect.

35:53.987 --> 35:56.239
You got to set your feet though.

35:56.364 --> 35:57.532
That's right.
Arm up.

35:57.657 --> 35:58.992
Lean back.
Lean back.

35:59.117 --> 36:00.368
Tuck your chin.

36:00.493 --> 36:01.995
You got to get close
to that horse's butt.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.788
That's part of bronc riding.

36:03.913 --> 36:04.831
It's good.

36:04.956 --> 36:05.915
It's a great technique.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.083
 See that?

36:07.208 --> 36:08.126
- Pull up on the rope.
- What?

36:08.251 --> 36:09.377
 Lean back.

36:09.502 --> 36:11.129
 I knew Caleb would
be good at this.

He's basically just
a big kid himself.

 Very good.

other day, in front of Maggie's.

You've been through a lot.

you needed, right?

36:44.537 --> 36:47.082
one foot in front of the other.

36:47.207 --> 36:49.793
 Why didn't you tell me
your Casey's sister-in-law?

36:49.918 --> 36:52.212
 I probably should
have, but I really

36:52.337 --> 36:54.589
wanted to avoid any nepotism.

36:54.714 --> 36:56.966
 Well, I shouldn't have just
dismissed you for being late.

36:57.092 --> 36:58.551
That wasn't fair.

36:58.677 --> 37:00.929
 No, that is completely
within your right.

37:01.054 --> 37:03.264
Being late looks bad.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.392
No hard feelings at all.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.518
 OK.

37:06.643 --> 37:08.353
Good because I'd
like you to come in

37:08.478 --> 37:10.063
to Maggie's tomorrow morning.

37:10.188 --> 37:11.564
Maybe we can have a do over?

37:11.690 --> 37:12.440
 Really?

37:12.565 --> 37:13.692
 Yeah.

37:13.817 --> 37:14.901
I think you could
be a really good fit

37:15.026 --> 37:15.944
for the management position.

37:19.197 --> 37:22.283
 I would love that.

Kick you feet forward.

 Hey.

Looks like you won't have
to worry about your smother

37:40.927 --> 37:42.178
anymore.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.139
I think Lou is
offering her the job.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.140
 Yeah?

37:45.265 --> 37:47.017
It's awesome.

37:47.142 --> 37:48.268
It's really good.

37:48.393 --> 37:49.477
She could really
use a win right now.

37:53.732 --> 37:55.984
So have you decided
about New York yet?

37:56.109 --> 37:56.985
 Yeah.

37:57.110 --> 38:00.071
I-- I decided not to go.

38:00.196 --> 38:03.241
I want to keep training Flame.

38:03.366 --> 38:04.409
 Is that all?

38:07.704 --> 38:08.705
 Yeah.

38:08.830 --> 38:11.332
I'll miss home
and everyone here.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.834
 Anyone in particular?

38:16.296 --> 38:17.505
 I mean my dog.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.635
 OK.

38:22.761 --> 38:25.472
So we've got about an hour left.

the mini broncs?

 Hey, Amy.

Look, I don't want to
fight with you, OK?

39:42.716 --> 39:44.634
This single mom
stuff is really hard.

39:44.759 --> 39:47.387
And, frankly, I was hoping
to have your support.

39:47.512 --> 39:48.722
 Lou, what do you
think I am right

39:48.847 --> 39:51.224
now if I'm not a single mom?

39:51.349 --> 39:53.518
You're not the only one.

39:53.643 --> 39:54.853
 You're right.

39:54.978 --> 39:56.730
Can we start over?

39:56.855 --> 39:59.107
I promise to try and
be less judgmental.

39:59.232 --> 40:00.150
 You judgmental?

40:00.275 --> 40:01.860
I can't picture it.

40:01.985 --> 40:02.736
 OK.

40:02.861 --> 40:03.570
OK.

40:03.695 --> 40:06.239
 Parenting is tough.

40:06.364 --> 40:07.115
 It's the toughest.

really good, actually.

 Hey.

40:33.224 --> 40:34.267
 Hey.

40:34.392 --> 40:35.143
 Mind if I sit down?

40:35.268 --> 40:36.144
 Sure.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.816
I'm sorry about last night.

40:41.941 --> 40:44.027
 Me too.

40:44.152 --> 40:47.155
 I want you to know, it was
a really difficult decision

40:47.280 --> 40:48.907
not to go to New York.

40:49.032 --> 40:50.283
I miss you.

40:50.408 --> 40:51.576
And I want to spend time
with you over the summer,

40:51.701 --> 40:55.288
but I can't leave
here right now.

40:55.413 --> 40:56.873
My whole life is here.

never have asked you

40:59.793 --> 41:02.003
to choose in the first place.

41:02.128 --> 41:04.964
I just want to know that
you're going to be OK,

41:05.090 --> 41:08.426
you're not going to spend the
whole summer resenting me.

41:08.551 --> 41:11.012
This won't change
anything between us.

41:11.137 --> 41:11.930
 It won't.

41:12.055 --> 41:14.724
I promise.

41:14.849 --> 41:16.976
 The only reason I'm spending
so much time in New York

41:17.102 --> 41:20.105
this summer is because this
Maggie's franchise is a once

41:20.230 --> 41:22.899

Yesterday, I thought I saw
your shadow running around.

It's funny how things never

So far from stars.
