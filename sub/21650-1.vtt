03:13.485 --> 03:15.819
Little bitch!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.322
Give me that bag. Oopsy-daisy.

03:18.073 --> 03:18.988
Ow!

03:18.990 --> 03:22.242
- Knock it off! Get off, Kenny!
- What do we got here? I'm gonna take that.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.743
- Get off him!
- What the fuck?

03:23.745 --> 03:26.373
- You're such a stupid fuck!
- What'd you just call me?

03:27.082 --> 03:29.707
I called you a stupid
fuck, you stupid fuck.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.126
Hey, don't touch her!

03:32.087 --> 03:33.878
Hey, I don't need your help, okay?

03:33.880 --> 03:37.175
That's all you're gonna do? Out
here by yourself, teach me a lesson?

03:38.593 --> 03:41.513
You got held back, didn't
you, Kenny? Twice, I think.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.557
You think that's funny?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.393
No, I think it's very sad, actually.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.562
I only mention it because
that would make you over 18.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.482
If you were to beat me up, which I'm
sure you could, it would be child abuse.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.530
So if you don't want to wind up on some
registry, I suggest you back the fuck...

04:19.259 --> 04:21.678
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

04:22.679 --> 04:25.680
I'm looking at homework here for
at least 15 different students.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.058
Are we really not gonna discuss
that I have an ice pack on my face?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.059
Nurse says you'll be fine.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.771
So no interest in why a teacher
found me sprawled out on the ground?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.523
Mia Sutton says she saw you
walk into a beam out back.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.068
How do you think we found you?

04:39.029 --> 04:42.113
All right. I get it. I'm in
trouble. All I'm trying to say is,

04:42.115 --> 04:45.074
you have the chance to stop the people
who make things hard for everybody.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.868
You gotta see the big picture here.

04:46.871 --> 04:47.955
Light...

04:48.789 --> 04:51.581
some people might look at
you, a kid in your situation,

04:51.583 --> 04:53.583
losing your mom the way you did,

04:53.585 --> 04:57.916
and they'd cut you a little slack when
it comes to these behavioral issues.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.258
Well, I don't believe in that.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.804
Detention. Two weeks. Get out of here.

05:18.311 --> 05:19.444
Hey.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.876
Oh! Hi. I'm awake.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.629
I was just like a tree
or a plant or something.

05:39.631 --> 05:43.385
I'm heading out for a moment. Don't
fall asleep or it adds another day.

06:05.407 --> 06:10.785
"Rule one: The human whose name
is written in this note shall die."

06:10.787 --> 06:11.705
Whoa.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.914
"Rule two: This note
will not take effect

06:14.916 --> 06:17.292
unless the writer has the
person's face in their mind

06:17.294 --> 06:18.587
when writing his or her name."

06:44.779 --> 06:46.114
Ah!

07:00.310 --> 07:01.463
Hello?

07:53.598 --> 07:56.724
Help! Help me! Help! Help!

08:02.983 --> 08:05.235
Holy shit! Holy shit!

08:07.028 --> 08:10.240
What the fuck?!

08:29.384 --> 08:31.467
Shall we begin?

08:39.436 --> 08:40.437
Okay.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.187
Relax, Light.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.731
You're asleep.

08:44.733 --> 08:49.152
You're asleep and you're
dreaming of some eight-foot-tall,

08:49.154 --> 08:51.571
demon-looking motherfucker.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.574
Oh, yes.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.577
A dream. I like that.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.705
Dreams are places you
can have fun, right?

09:00.707 --> 09:04.625
It's all in your mind,
so why not enjoy it?

09:04.627 --> 09:06.171
Shh.

09:07.574 --> 09:08.838
Listen.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.008
Get off of me!

09:12.510 --> 09:13.722
Go, check it out.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.977
- No!
- Come on! Come on!

09:22.979 --> 09:24.020
What?

09:24.022 --> 09:26.314
Kenny, no! Let me go! Get off me!

09:26.316 --> 09:28.777
You're so disgusting!
Get the fuck off of me!

09:30.195 --> 09:32.779
- Ooh! While you're down there...
- Aw, it sucks to be you.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.449
Now we could, in this dream of yours,

09:36.451 --> 09:40.121
take care of a situation like this.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.500
We just put Kenny's name down...

09:44.250 --> 09:45.919
and see what happens.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.758
Yeah.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.805
- Nah.
- Get off! You're such assholes!

09:58.807 --> 10:00.934
I know you want to.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.436
Go on.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.730
Help her.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.941
I don't have a pen.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.071
It's a good thing you have a pen.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.789
Ah...

10:28.253 --> 10:32.797
Good. Now as long as we're
playing, let's do it right.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.716
There's no need to stop at "who."

10:35.718 --> 10:37.802
I'm sorry. What else is there?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.222
How.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.188
For a beginner, not bad at all.

10:48.061 --> 10:49.190
Now...

10:50.650 --> 10:51.609
watch.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.323
Give it back!

11:26.811 --> 11:28.603
Ah!

11:33.526 --> 11:37.028
Now listen. I need to separate
the wheat from the chaff.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.196
I think you might be
capable of great things,

11:39.198 --> 11:41.949
but if you don't think you
can handle it, that's fine.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.576
Just put the note somewhere,

11:43.578 --> 11:47.538
leave it alone for seven days,
and I'll find it a new home.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.998
How can this be possible?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.709
It happened. Just like that.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.755
And if this is possible,
imagine what else you could do.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.175
- He a friend of yours?
- Who?

12:39.801 --> 12:40.927
Kid in the accident.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.472
Oh. No, I don't think he
was a friend of anyone.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.266
Want to talk about it?

12:49.824 --> 12:50.864
No.

12:50.867 --> 12:53.225
We should talk about why
you were still at school.

12:53.228 --> 12:54.939
Oh, yeah, that wasn't a big deal.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.194
I just wrote a couple papers
and then got detention.

12:57.197 --> 13:00.639
You don't think cheating's
a big deal? That who you are?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.865
No, um...

13:03.658 --> 13:06.494
Actually, I only got caught because
I was trying to break up a...

13:09.455 --> 13:12.123
Know what? Doesn't matter.
You wouldn't understand anyway.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.709
Because you're just that
smart or I'm just that dumb?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.795
Because this is what you do. Instead
of trying to solve real problems,

13:17.797 --> 13:20.840
you look over people's shoulders
so you can bust them for bullshit,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.175
like not turning in
their reports or whatever.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.304
A gun is only good as its aim, son.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.433
I make sure people can trust our aim.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.854
Just once, it would be nice
to think that you actually...

13:34.856 --> 13:36.939
I mean, you're a cop.
How do you sleep at night

13:36.941 --> 13:39.859
knowing you watched while a guy
like Antony Skomal walked away?

13:39.861 --> 13:41.235
You think I just watched?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.863
If I was a cop and some
guy ran over my wife,

13:43.865 --> 13:46.574
I'd be pretty pissed off if his
dad paid his way out of jail.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.577
He killed my mom, he nearly
beat his girlfriend to death,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.204
and you just sit there
saying the same bullshit

13:52.206 --> 13:55.583
- about how people better trust your aim...
- I'm gonna assume you're still raw

13:55.585 --> 13:57.251
by what you saw today at school,

13:57.253 --> 13:59.587
and that's keeping you from
thinking before you speak.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.591
I suggest you stop talking.

14:28.326 --> 14:32.497
"Rule 64: Each page of the note
contains the power of the whole note."

14:34.623 --> 14:36.915
"Rule 95: Anyone may
write names in the note,

14:36.918 --> 14:39.502
but only the keeper can possess it
for more than seven days." Jesus!

14:39.504 --> 14:41.005
How many rules does it take to...

14:43.758 --> 14:45.758
"Don't trust Ryuk.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.718
He is not your pet.
He is not your friend."

15:47.572 --> 15:49.155
- Hey, kid.
- Ah!

15:49.157 --> 15:51.117
It's pronounced Ree-yook.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.201
Ryuk.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.164
Oh. Hi.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.583
Sorry for the mispronunciation.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.289
Ryuk, what exactly can I
do with this Death Note?

16:02.292 --> 16:04.211
What exactly did you have in mind?

16:04.213 --> 16:07.047
Well, it says that I can
specify the manner of death.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.509
If I can choose how they die, does
that mean I can actually control them?

16:10.511 --> 16:14.763
Every human spends the last moments of
his life in the shadow of a death god.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.434
If we so desire, we can
influence those moments.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.480
There are, of course, limitations.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.521
"Rule 20:

16:22.523 --> 16:27.320
A subject can be influenced for no more
than two days leading up to his death."

16:28.529 --> 16:30.070
Two days? Your fingers are huge.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.479
"Rule 28: Each death must
be physically possible,"

16:33.482 --> 16:36.494
so no shark attacks while
someone's on the toilet.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.540
As much as I love that idea.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.665
Uh, where did it come from?

16:41.667 --> 16:45.169
The history of the note is
as long as history itself.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.588
But who gave it to me? I
mean, did you give it to me?

16:47.590 --> 16:52.053
The last keeper of the note passed
away. It fell to me to find a new one.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.179
- What if I didn't want it?
- You may pass it on.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.517
Or better yet, I will.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.100
- How would you do that?
- I told you!

17:00.102 --> 17:03.646
When the note is separated
from the keeper for seven days,

17:03.648 --> 17:05.564
I find a new one.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.691
Who wrote those warnings
about you in the margins?

17:07.693 --> 17:12.279
Oh, is that what we're gonna do with
the note, Light? Rules and warnings?

17:30.241 --> 17:32.319
_

17:43.980 --> 17:48.253
The name and the face
is all you have to have.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.257
Turner.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.927
Yeah, no, it's fine. What's going on?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.597
Say that again.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.016
You gotta be kidding me.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.065
All right, yeah. I'll see you in a bit.

19:09.554 --> 19:10.650
All right.

19:12.147 --> 19:14.276
Hey.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.905
Hey, uh, one second.

19:16.452 --> 19:17.531
Come in.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.119
Hey, what you up to?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.080
Uh, just fell asleep on my desk.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.166
I just got a call.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.503
Our friend Antony Skomal is no more.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.338
Impaled himself on a steak knife
in the middle of a restaurant.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.715
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.841
You seem happy.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.012
Probably shouldn't be, but yeah, I am.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.517
Your mom...

19:46.394 --> 19:48.521
she always was kind of a hippy.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.356
And we didn't see eye
to eye on everything.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.942
She was damn sure right about one thing.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.487
Karma's a bitch.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.785
Sorry about what I said... you know.

20:05.155 --> 20:06.247
Love you, son.

20:07.790 --> 20:08.958
I love you, too.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.329
- Go, go!
- Yeah! Watch your feet!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.000
You in mourning?

20:52.126 --> 20:53.919
In... Uh, what?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.545
Our friend Kenny.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.924
Oh, yeah. It's terrible
what happened to Kenny.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.095
You don't have to lie to
me. Kenny was a sociopath,

21:05.097 --> 21:07.347
and just because he's dead
does not make it a tragedy.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.226
- Right.
- I just wish I'd seen it.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.284
I heard his head spun
all the way around.

21:12.287 --> 21:14.813
Actually, his head exploded
into a million pieces.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.899
- In case you're wondering.
- You saw it?

21:16.901 --> 21:17.860
Mm-hmm.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.536
- I'm Mia.
- Oh, hi.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.996
I know that you're Mia,
actually. I already knew that.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.457
I know that you're Light
Turner. I already knew that.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.750
Yeah.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.211
You knew that I'm... You know my name?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.546
So are you gonna tell me
what you saw, Light Turner?

21:39.548 --> 21:41.425
Why did you get me put into detention?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.469
I'm sorry.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.429
I, uh... thought you could
use some medical attention

21:47.431 --> 21:49.848
and I wasn't aware of the fact
that you were carrying around

21:49.850 --> 21:52.394
a stockpile of illegal
papers in your backpack.

21:53.771 --> 21:54.895
Is that one of them?

21:54.897 --> 21:57.022
Hmm? Oh, no.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.233
"Death Note"? What is it?

21:59.235 --> 22:01.403
- What is what?
- Your book.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.241
Uh, I can't tell you.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.245
- Okay.
- Do you really want to know?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.208
- Sure.
- Okay, then I'll tell you. I just...

22:15.835 --> 22:16.961
Follow me.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.264
Please tell me this
isn't your poetry journal.

22:30.266 --> 22:34.186
When you see him, try not to
freak out. I freaked out a little.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.688
See... who?

22:37.691 --> 22:38.791
Behind you.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.821
It's okay.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.862
What are you talking about?

22:45.864 --> 22:48.861
Only the keeper of the note can see me.

22:48.864 --> 22:52.371
"The human whose name is written
in this note... shall die."

22:53.643 --> 22:55.247
- Your poetry sucks.
- It's not poetry.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.710
Um, will you just read the last entry?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.590
"Kenny Doyle decapitation"?

23:05.009 --> 23:06.635
I have, and...

23:08.053 --> 23:10.804
I'm gonna sound crazy,
but I have a death god.

23:17.104 --> 23:20.480
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- No. No, don't go. Trust me.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.776
You of all people are
gonna want to see this.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.654
Authorities received a 911 call...

23:27.656 --> 23:28.989
Okay, we can work with that.

23:28.991 --> 23:33.744
Overheard a violent argument between
Mr. Brode and his ex-wife earlier today.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.245
Things escalated,

23:35.247 --> 23:39.458
as several gunshots were also heard,
and the situation is still unfolding.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.126
Authorities are standing by.

23:41.128 --> 23:45.088
Seattle police and Seattle SWAT
trying to de-escalate the situation.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.008
This is live coverage
of the hostage situation.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.927
- Okay. Watch.
- Police are now confirming the hostages

23:50.929 --> 23:54.640
- are Brode's ex-wife and children.
- Hope you know what you're doing.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.517
With his violent history,
police are hesitant

23:57.519 --> 23:59.895
about moving in on this situation.

24:02.441 --> 24:06.767
You stupid bitch! You fucking stay
there, you snot-nose little douchebag!

24:06.770 --> 24:10.991
It appears that James Brode
is exiting the storefront.

24:15.426 --> 24:17.704
It looks like he has released her.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.625
That's definitely a good sign.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.718
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my goodness.

24:32.846 --> 24:36.223
Uh, folks, we are trying
to get more information.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.266
I hope no children were watching this.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.103
This is obviously
very upsetting footage.

24:41.105 --> 24:45.607
In case you're just tuning in,
the man holding his family hostage

24:45.609 --> 24:49.820
just saluted to cameras before
being run over by a rogue SWAT truck.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.614
We apologize for these
disturbing images...

24:52.616 --> 24:53.902
I killed him.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.840
I guess I should feel
guilty, but I don't.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.761
That woman and her kids are only alive
right now because of what you did.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.723
What is there to feel guilty about?

25:16.724 --> 25:19.141
Thing is, I know what it's
like to get fucked over.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.437
Some asshole killed my mom and...

25:22.521 --> 25:25.856
got away with it until I got this book.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.608
I just keep thinking, I mean,
why should it just be for me?

25:28.610 --> 25:32.446
I mean, all the people that make
life miserable, make life dangerous...

25:32.448 --> 25:33.824
I can reach them now.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.036
Do you think that I'm crazy?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.709
If anything, I think
you're not crazy enough.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.300
- We could change the world.
- "We"?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.138
Like "we" as... as in us?

26:08.817 --> 26:11.111
We're getting an update live...

26:12.154 --> 26:13.864
The police are extremely hesitant...

26:31.882 --> 26:33.091
Can I kiss you?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.095
You're not supposed to ask.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.390
What am I supposed to do?

27:00.869 --> 27:03.163
The note was filled
with names when I got it.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.500
Whoever had it before us,
what did they accomplish?

27:07.251 --> 27:09.920
Just small-time killings,
revenge, petty crimes?

27:10.671 --> 27:13.966
I think we can do a lot more than
just settle some random scores.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.093
How about this guy?

27:19.930 --> 27:22.848
I don't want people to say
they're scared of it or horrified.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.250
What do you want them to say?

27:25.352 --> 27:28.397
I want them to say... "Thank you."

27:35.237 --> 27:36.613
Look at those people.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.324
- They're a bunch of sheep.
- No, they're not.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.660
They're looking for someone
who's not gonna let them down

27:43.662 --> 27:45.203
the way cops do and politicians.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.788
And that's why they have you.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.834
It's bigger than me.
It's bigger than us.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.586
What they want...

27:51.831 --> 27:52.963
is a god.

27:54.011 --> 27:55.422
So let's give it to them.

27:55.424 --> 27:59.009
Let's give them a god,
let's make a name for him.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.219
A god that never lets anybody down.

28:01.221 --> 28:04.639
It's not gonna solve a few
crimes, it's gonna solve all crime.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.850
A god that scares the
shit out of the bad guys

28:06.852 --> 28:08.727
until they don't want to be bad anymore?

28:08.729 --> 28:12.024
A god who inspires hope that
things can actually change.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.066
Kira.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.943
Kira? What does that mean?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.862
It means "light" in Russian and Celtic.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.406
Wouldn't you be worried they
could trace it back to you?

28:21.408 --> 28:22.657
No. How could they?

28:22.659 --> 28:25.535
It also sort of means
"killer" in Japanese,

28:25.537 --> 28:28.165
so if they're looking, it's
gonna be on the wrong continent.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.585
Who or what is Kira?

28:33.587 --> 28:36.613
That's the question facing
baffled investigators today

28:36.616 --> 28:41.099
as death row inmates in six different
continents were found dead in their cells.

28:41.102 --> 28:45.430
Each victim left behind the same
message written in perfect Japanese.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.475
It reads, "Lord Kira has
returned to punish the wicked."

28:48.477 --> 28:51.480
None of the victims
actually spoke Japanese...

28:52.731 --> 28:54.147
I think I got one.

28:54.149 --> 28:57.359
Reports are that the
previously elusive leader

28:57.361 --> 29:00.820
of the terrorist movement blew
himself up in front of his men.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.159
Kira is apparently
behind the bizarre deaths.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.704
Five members of the cartel
apparently threw themselves

29:09.706 --> 29:12.082
in front of an oncoming train.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.335
Kira is responsible
for all of these acts

29:15.337 --> 29:17.087
that are happening right now.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.964
The globalists will have you believe

29:18.966 --> 29:22.467
that Kira's the New World Messiah
here to right the wrongs of our time.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.928
This is another bid by the super
elites to sweep the rug from under us

29:25.931 --> 29:28.764
and shape our reality by
what can only be described

29:28.767 --> 29:32.519
as one of the greatest false flag
operations in the history of covert ops.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.479
Fear they will be punished by Kira

29:34.481 --> 29:39.818
has led to a series of wanted criminals
literally turning themselves in.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.197
Kira's had a bigger impact on
crime than anything I've seen.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.994
I don't wanna say our job's
gotten easier, but look around you.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.129
News out of Japan tonight

29:59.131 --> 30:02.465
where Kira has apparently struck again.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.677
More than a dozen were found
dead in a Tokyo nightclub,

30:05.679 --> 30:09.139
a scene authorities described
as "incredibly gruesome."

30:09.141 --> 30:11.599
What can anyone tell us about Kira?

30:11.601 --> 30:15.186
And perhaps, more importantly,
can anyone stop it?

30:15.188 --> 30:16.690
And should they?

30:16.737 --> 30:19.072
_

30:36.367 --> 30:37.959
It makes no sense.

30:37.961 --> 30:41.421
The Nakamuras and the Inagawas
have had a truce for over ten years.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.548
How would Kira even know about them?

30:43.550 --> 30:45.759
- Because I tipped him off.
- What?

30:45.761 --> 30:48.345
I've had access to law enforcement
databases for some time.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.680
I've been seeding the
names of obscure criminals,

30:50.682 --> 30:52.434
waiting for a hit.

30:53.030 --> 30:56.730
And now... we know
who we're looking for.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.965
How long since you've slept?

31:24.633 --> 31:25.717
Forty-one hours.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.137
And you're certain of your conclusions?

31:29.846 --> 31:32.806
Yes.

31:32.808 --> 31:37.143
The insulin spike from the candies will
focus your mind for final consideration.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.439
When it fades, you
will sleep for one hour.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.236
Wear these to properly
prepare your body clock.

31:47.531 --> 31:50.490
I've been contemplating
several different strategies.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.575
I honestly don't know
that I'll be able to sleep.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.747
- Sleep is key to strong thought.
- Yes.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.667
Would you mind singing a song for me?

32:00.585 --> 32:01.670
Of course.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.964
♪ You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark ♪

32:05.966 --> 32:08.883

32:47.966 --> 32:51.511
Investigation, since when? And why
are you just telling me this now?

32:52.179 --> 32:54.055
Because I just got added last week.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.765
Knowing you'd have this sort
of calm and thoughtful response,

32:57.767 --> 33:00.435
I can't imagine why I
didn't bring it up sooner.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.103
What part of terrorists
killing each other

33:02.105 --> 33:04.185
and criminals turning
themselves in bothers you, Dad?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.983
Why exactly are they doing that, son?

33:06.985 --> 33:10.194
- They're doing it because of Kira.
- Right, and who is that?

33:10.197 --> 33:14.073
How does Kira get to decide who lives
and dies, who's guilty and innocent?

33:14.075 --> 33:17.118
Is there a complaints department if
I don't like one of Kira's decisions?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.412
Or would complaining get
me put on Kira's list?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.247
Is that what everybody
at the station thinks?

33:21.249 --> 33:25.003
Well, it's safe to say I'm
ahead of the curve on that one.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.088
Hey, how do I look?

33:28.715 --> 33:30.842
- Good.
- All right. See you this afternoon.

33:50.534 --> 33:52.736
_

33:57.869 --> 34:01.538
- Turner.
- Just got a call from the FBI.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.873
Apparently, they got someone
who wants to speak with you.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.751
- Oh, yeah? And who is that? 
- They're not really saying.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.503
Just said he helped them out before

34:08.505 --> 34:10.797
and he's got a theory
on the Kira situation.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.466
- I just got the case. What does he want?
- I have no idea.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.051
They said he's a little different.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.262
In fact, they'll probably
send a representative...

34:17.264 --> 34:18.184
Detective Turner?

34:18.974 --> 34:20.598
I am to meet with Detective Turner,

34:20.600 --> 34:24.853
local head of the Kira investigation,
in his office at 9:00 a.m.

34:26.523 --> 34:27.623
Call you back.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.152
- What can I do for you?
- I am Watari.

34:34.378 --> 34:36.154
Your fellow officers did that?

34:36.157 --> 34:39.033
Cops don't like it when
you go after other cops,

34:39.034 --> 34:41.661
but, apparently, they hate it
when you go after their god.

34:41.663 --> 34:42.829
They support Kira?

34:42.831 --> 34:44.831
Kira's doing away with
the "Most Wanted" list.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.291
These guys wanna throw him a parade.

34:46.293 --> 34:50.378
But now that rumor has it
Kira's a cop, it's in my world.

34:50.380 --> 34:55.257
The idea that Kira is associated
with law enforcement is not a rumor.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.884
It is a fact,

34:56.886 --> 34:59.512
uncovered by the individual I work with.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.599
- Oh, yeah, and who's that?
- He goes by the letter "L."

35:02.601 --> 35:03.600
L is real?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.351
You're familiar?

35:05.353 --> 35:06.521
Yeah, I hear things.

35:07.397 --> 35:09.981
That giant smuggling
ring in Eastern Europe,

35:09.983 --> 35:11.733
practically handed to
police on a platter.

35:11.735 --> 35:15.111
L would like to speak with you
regarding the Kira investigation.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.324
- Okay. When?
- Right now.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.958
- Hmm, Detective Turner.
- What is this?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.378
A one-time offer.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.379
I'd like to assist you
in the capture of Kira.

35:33.381 --> 35:37.258
Why me? The FBI, CIA have
hundreds of men on this.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.844
I've been in communication
with Interpol and the FBI,

35:39.846 --> 35:42.680
but I believe you have
something they do not.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.642
What's that?

35:44.351 --> 35:46.934
An in-depth understanding
of potential suspects.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.561
Why would I have a better understanding?

35:48.563 --> 35:51.564
The FBI thinks the killer
is operating out of Japan.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.107
Because of the name Kira.

35:53.109 --> 35:56.611
Ah, but the name is an
intentional misdirection.

35:56.613 --> 36:00.325
He wants us to believe that he's
Japanese, operating a half a world away.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.202
He's not.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.330
Kira's in Seattle.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.084
Shall we help one another?

36:25.057 --> 36:27.766
"Justice for the Wicked." What is this?

36:27.769 --> 36:29.644
It's a site for Kira worshipers.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.813
They put up names of
people that deserve to die.

36:31.815 --> 36:32.855
Holy shit.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.440
Rapists, pedophiles,

36:34.442 --> 36:36.693
human trafficking, murder.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.655
This guy killed four
people in a house fire.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.583
I don't know. How do
we know that it's real?

36:41.594 --> 36:42.593
What do you mean?

36:42.596 --> 36:46.183
What if somebody fucked your girlfriend
and you put him on the list to kill him?

36:47.455 --> 36:49.249
What would you do if some guy fucked me?

36:50.166 --> 36:53.126
- Oh, I'd kill him.
- Yeah?

36:53.128 --> 36:54.446
- Yeah.
- You'd kill him?

36:54.449 --> 36:55.628
- Yeah.
- You'd kill him?

36:55.630 --> 36:58.967
But that is the reason why we can't
kill people based on website rumors.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.468
It's not like that.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.432
These are real people with real
problems, and they've been ignored.

37:07.684 --> 37:08.685
They need our help.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.147
Figured you'd be older.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.066
And that I'd be able to
see more of your face.

37:58.193 --> 38:02.487
Yes, well, I find I'm not in a
very trusting mood these days.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.823
I took the liberty of moving your
evidence to a more secure location.

38:05.825 --> 38:08.912
Oh, I can see that. Were
you gonna let me know or...?

38:10.163 --> 38:13.915
Wow, this is very, very impressive,
James. Your men must be proud.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.169
Ask your partner how my men
think about me these days.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.880
So you did all of this yourself?

38:20.381 --> 38:21.966
Even more impressive.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.637
Please, James, have a
seat. Rest your glutes.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.434
Mm-mmm. You've made two mistakes.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.437
This is zero day, Kira's
first recorded murders.

38:36.439 --> 38:40.149
But previously, on April 15th,
convicted felon James W. Brode

38:40.151 --> 38:42.777
had taken his wife and children hostage.

38:42.779 --> 38:45.279
I remember that. You
think that was Kira?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.824
Initial speculation was that
his behavior was drug-related,

38:47.826 --> 38:50.451
but lost in the ensuing
crush of Kira activities

38:50.453 --> 38:53.621
was the fact that Brode's
toxicology had come back clean.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.581
The stand-off had never
made national news,

38:55.583 --> 38:58.209
and it was only broadcast
on local Seattle stations.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.212
- So that's how you knew he was here.
- I infiltrated your network

39:01.214 --> 39:03.714
in order to ensure that there
hadn't been a data breach.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.467
Prior to my access,
the network was intact.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.151
Did you just hand me evidence
you hacked the Seattle P.D.?

39:09.154 --> 39:11.848
I handed you evidence
that whoever Kira is,

39:11.850 --> 39:14.559
they have access to the
database from the inside.

39:14.561 --> 39:15.645
Kira's one of ours.

39:15.648 --> 39:19.272
Here's a cross-reference list
of officers and their access

39:19.274 --> 39:21.858
as well as the dates of Kira activities.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.069
The Federal Administration has agreed
to make resources available to us.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.321
We can begin seeing who was where when.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.368
- What are you gonna do?
- I'd like to start by speaking with Kira.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.704
Sure you are.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.062
- Hey.
- Light, turn on the news.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.190
The individual known as Kira,

40:03.192 --> 40:06.527
as I'm sure you're aware, has
taken credit for over 400 deaths.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.778
Oh, shit.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.281
While we don't know how
he kills his victims,

40:10.283 --> 40:12.074
we do know how he chooses them.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.367
Prior to these deaths,

40:13.369 --> 40:16.623
all of the victims have had their
identities released to the media.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.293
This would suggest that Kira
is not some omnipotent force.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.670
He's a person...

40:23.588 --> 40:24.756
like you or me.

40:25.506 --> 40:26.674
He is also a coward.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.800
A child wielding power
he does not understand,

40:29.802 --> 40:33.763
mistakenly believing in doing
so, he's at no risk to himself.

40:33.765 --> 40:34.805
He's wrong.

40:34.807 --> 40:39.604
Kira, if you're watching this,
know that I am coming for you.

40:40.772 --> 40:44.607
Unless, of course, you'd
like to kill me right now.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.699
Now I'm rooting for this guy.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.119
Would you shut the fuck up?

40:55.833 --> 40:56.996
No?

40:58.456 --> 41:01.374
Well, in that case, Kira,

41:01.376 --> 41:04.710
I shall be meeting you
face-to-face very shortly.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.337
Who does this guy think he is?

41:12.095 --> 41:13.763
What the fuck was that?

41:15.723 --> 41:16.806
I have a theory.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.560
Kira cannot kill by simply sight alone.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.687
He needs a name and a face.

41:22.689 --> 41:25.231
Every victim we've seen
so far fits this pattern.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.149
So you antagonize him on purpose?

41:27.151 --> 41:29.610
While withholding my
identity from the record.

41:29.612 --> 41:33.572
Now, we know that he wants
to kill me but is unable.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.909
And what if you're wrong?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.329
Then, James, I'd be dead.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.916
Either way, we'll have
gained valuable information.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.752
He always pull this kind of stuff?

42:08.735 --> 42:10.695
You guys getting close to catching Kira?

42:12.081 --> 42:15.627
Oh, I'd say the haystack's down
to a hay pile. Still a lot of hay.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.161
I saw the press conference today.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.204
Who's that guy on TV
with the turtleneck?

42:22.206 --> 42:25.376
You like that look? I'm
thinking of taking it myself.

42:27.253 --> 42:28.419
Hmm.

42:28.421 --> 42:31.672
Goes by L. He's an
independent investigator.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.883
Wow, so you don't even
know his real name.

42:33.885 --> 42:37.428
About the only thing I know is
he's got some handler named Watari.

42:37.430 --> 42:38.929
Really likes ice cream.

42:38.931 --> 42:41.223
He's connected an awful lot of dots.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.603
Do you think he's connected
the dots because he's Kira?

42:45.563 --> 42:47.063
I don't think so.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.273
He has a history of cracking big cases.

42:49.275 --> 42:53.194
Besides, I think you can tell when you're
sitting across from a killer like Kira.

42:53.196 --> 42:54.737
Right. Of course.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.947
What happens when they catch Kira?

42:56.949 --> 42:59.825
Well... he's murdered over 400 people,

42:59.827 --> 43:02.244
so, my guess...

43:02.246 --> 43:05.247
it's probably gonna be a fight
between those who want to hang him

43:05.249 --> 43:08.711
and those who want to dissect
him and figure out how he did it.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.840
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.691
You put someone on my kid?

43:32.693 --> 43:35.736
We agreed that everyone with access
needed to be thoroughly vetted.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.239
I did not see it prudent to
have you investigate yourself.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.866
What? We're not talking
about investigating me.

43:40.868 --> 43:42.701
We're talking about
having my son followed!

43:42.703 --> 43:45.079
I investigated you prior
to offering my assistance

43:45.081 --> 43:46.705
and concluded you are not Kira.

43:46.707 --> 43:49.125
As for your son, he may
have access to databases

43:49.127 --> 43:50.835
around which we have
centered our search.

43:50.837 --> 43:54.755
Therefore, deserves the same scrutiny
as anyone else that fits that criteria.

43:54.757 --> 43:57.176
- No, he's a kid!
- Yes.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.469
- A particularly bright kid.
- You know what?

44:00.471 --> 44:03.641
If you had any questions about
my son, you should've come to me.

44:04.767 --> 44:05.852
Here you go.

44:10.880 --> 44:13.691
Even if they're suspicious, I
don't see how they can prove it.

44:13.693 --> 44:16.195
I think we just go quiet
until they stop following us.

44:16.946 --> 44:20.447
- What do you mean "go quiet"?
- Stop fucking around with the Death Note.

44:20.449 --> 44:22.032
Is that what you think we're doing?

44:22.034 --> 44:25.202
Come on, Light. Just get rid
of them. All we need is a name.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.965
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Not gonna do what?

44:27.665 --> 44:29.999
- I was talking to Ryuk.
- I like this one, Light.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.420
- She has wonderful ideas.
- What'd he say?

44:33.045 --> 44:34.797
Ryuk? Not much.

44:36.132 --> 44:39.216
- We're good. They're trying to stop us.
- We don't kill innocent people, Mia.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.135
Even if I wanted to, which I don't,

44:41.137 --> 44:43.762
taking out the guy following us
will only indicate that it's me.

44:43.764 --> 44:47.266
You'd have to get rid of all the agents,
regardless of who they're following.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.767
They wouldn't know who it was,

44:48.769 --> 44:51.186
but they'd know what happens
when you fuck with Kira.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.314
- Can't believe you're saying this.
- Cant believe you're not.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.985
Then I guess we're really
fucking lucky that it's my book.

44:57.955 --> 45:00.862
Kira has been strangely
inactive of late,

45:00.865 --> 45:03.532
something authorities
are eager to point to

45:03.534 --> 45:07.119
as evidence their investigation
is gaining momentum.

45:07.121 --> 45:10.748
However, Kira supporters
have begun to criticize police

45:10.750 --> 45:12.666
for suppressing its activities,

45:12.668 --> 45:15.628
as a small but noticeable
spike in global crime

45:15.630 --> 45:19.924
has become apparent in the absence of
recent activities from the phenomena.

45:19.926 --> 45:21.550
Are you leaving?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.719
Yeah, I've got some work to do.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.138
There's a guy on the news
who killed a couple kids.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.681
I thought maybe we
could make some popcorn,

45:27.683 --> 45:29.892
take some names down for later.

45:29.894 --> 45:30.937
I'll see you tomorrow.

45:53.376 --> 45:56.712
Director Pearl. These just
came in from the field offices.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.548
Tell them to keep surveillance
on all the potential...

46:07.932 --> 46:10.226
Assistant Director Pearl is
dead. Heart attack, just now.

46:10.977 --> 46:13.813
We need to contact every
FBI agent on their team.

46:19.830 --> 46:20.943
This is Franks.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.903
Agent Franks, your team
has been compromised.

46:22.906 --> 46:25.867
Drop what you're doing and get to
the nearest hospital. Right now.

46:26.575 --> 46:27.618
Agent Franks?

46:28.244 --> 46:30.454
Agent Franks, can you hear me?

47:11.162 --> 47:14.455
Twelve FBI agents
mysteriously commit suicide.

47:14.457 --> 47:17.207
Some sources say it
was the work of Kira.

47:17.209 --> 47:20.337
This is the first time Kira
has attacked law enforcement.

47:20.882 --> 47:23.883
- Slow down for one second?
- He did it! Son of a bitch killed them.

47:23.886 --> 47:25.841
- Ryuk?
- There's so many rules in that thing!

47:25.843 --> 47:27.468
There must be some kind of loophole.

47:27.470 --> 47:29.346
What's he gonna do if you go after him?

47:30.139 --> 47:32.306
Maybe you just need to
take a minute and relax

47:32.308 --> 47:34.685
and see if this was the best
thing that could've happened.

47:35.781 --> 47:36.896
No.

47:40.858 --> 47:41.942
Ryuk!

47:42.610 --> 47:44.693
You think I'm some dog, Light?

47:44.695 --> 47:47.696
You can just snap your
fingers and I'll come running?

47:47.698 --> 47:51.283
- Did you kill those FBI agents?
- What do you think?

47:51.285 --> 47:54.203
I decide who dies, you obey
me. Those are the rules.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.872
- Who do you think wrote the rules?
- Whose side are you on?

47:56.874 --> 47:59.249
There are no sides, only the game.

47:59.251 --> 48:02.211
And I knew eventually you
wouldn't be able to handle playing.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.463
I asked politely, but
you didn't hear me.

48:04.465 --> 48:05.923
Let the note go.

48:05.925 --> 48:08.634
Look at the strife it's causing
you and your little girlfriend.

48:08.636 --> 48:12.137
Let me find it a new home.
We'll be free of each other.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.306
I'm not gonna give the
note to you or anybody else,

48:14.308 --> 48:17.392
and if you fuck with me again,
I'm gonna put your name in it.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.189
You could try.

48:22.191 --> 48:25.943
But I warn you, there are
four letters in my name.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.614
Most anyone's ever gotten were two.

48:30.408 --> 48:33.994
Mm.

48:44.964 --> 48:47.881
We interrupt this to take
you live to an announcement...

48:47.883 --> 48:49.716
- What the fuck is he doing?
- By James Turner,

48:49.718 --> 48:51.677
local head of the Kira investigation.

48:51.679 --> 48:52.636
Oh, shit.

48:52.638 --> 48:56.223
Those of you that harbored any
illusions about what Kira really is,

48:56.225 --> 48:58.559
the cold-blooded murder
of a dozen FBI agents

48:58.561 --> 49:00.769
should lay bare his true nature.

49:00.771 --> 49:05.357
Kira is a cowardly criminal thug
concerned only with self-preservation.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.317
Not only is he unworthy

49:07.319 --> 49:11.196
of the veneration and celebration
he's received in certain circles,

49:11.198 --> 49:14.741
as of today, he's not
even worthy of our fear.

49:14.743 --> 49:15.953
Understand this, Kira.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.204
You may strike me down,

49:19.206 --> 49:21.456
but another one will
stand up and take my place.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.750
Why would he do that? He's
forcing Kira to retaliate.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.170
And another for as long as need be.

49:26.172 --> 49:27.296
We will not waiver.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.423
- Because he's not afraid.
- We will not submit.

49:29.425 --> 49:31.177
And we will not fail.

49:38.757 --> 49:39.852
Where is it?

49:40.812 --> 49:43.061
What? Are you out of your
mind? That's my fucking dad!

49:43.063 --> 49:45.671
Yeah, and he just dared us to
kill him on live television.

49:45.674 --> 49:48.384
Think people are gonna be on their
knees if he can talk to Kira like that?

49:48.386 --> 49:51.153
We're not killing my dad!
This is over! Ryuk fucked us!

49:51.155 --> 49:52.531
We're not the good guys anymore.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.499
What happened to the boy that
wanted the world to get what he got?

49:58.829 --> 50:00.039
Think about your mom, Light.

50:02.958 --> 50:05.252
Either Kira stands up
or they hunt us down.

50:06.629 --> 50:09.006
If you want out, then
just get the fuck out!

50:14.553 --> 50:16.013
So you just want to quit?

50:17.973 --> 50:19.225
I don't know.

50:30.945 --> 50:35.405
Well said, James. Tell me, are
you truly ready to give your life?

50:35.407 --> 50:36.617
If that's what it takes.

50:38.661 --> 50:41.330
How long will it take
him to decide, I wonder?

50:51.423 --> 50:52.508
What's going on?

50:59.306 --> 51:02.184
Let me take this.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.814
- Turner.
- This is L.

51:08.816 --> 51:10.816
Just making sure you hadn't died.

51:10.818 --> 51:12.109
Still here.

51:12.111 --> 51:14.196
Excellent. Carry on.

51:19.451 --> 51:20.744
I'm really proud of you.

51:27.668 --> 51:29.626
Understand this, Kira.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.837
- You may strike me down...
- Sir?

51:31.839 --> 51:34.715
- But another will take my place.
- Light Turner is Kira.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.384
- And another and another...
- How long since you've slept?

51:37.386 --> 51:39.386
for as long as need
be.. Thirtyone hours.

51:39.388 --> 51:42.848
- We will not waiver. We will not submit.
- Sleep is key to strong thought.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.725
- Trust me.
- And we will not fail.

51:44.727 --> 51:46.562
Nothing's gonna change once I wake up.

52:10.036 --> 52:11.170
Hello, Light.

52:12.546 --> 52:14.131
Oh, um...

52:14.757 --> 52:16.548
You're the guy. You're L.

52:16.550 --> 52:18.550
Yeah, well, it's not my real name.

52:18.552 --> 52:20.763
But I'm sure you're
painfully aware of that.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.889
What are you doing here?

52:23.891 --> 52:25.142
Following a lead. You?

52:25.934 --> 52:28.437
Um... I was just... I'm leaving.

52:30.147 --> 52:32.439
I wonder if it was a difficult decision.

52:32.441 --> 52:34.566
If what was a difficult decision?

52:34.568 --> 52:35.861
Sparing your father's life.

52:37.654 --> 52:39.279
Sorry, what are you talking about?

52:39.281 --> 52:42.908
You must've known it would implicate you,
yet you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

52:42.910 --> 52:45.452
I'll admit, I always
wondered if you had a line.

52:45.454 --> 52:47.579
I guess it's fortunate for us,

52:47.581 --> 52:51.833
the line you finally decided to draw
points so clearly in your direction.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.835
- So you really think I'm Kira.
- No, I know it.

52:53.837 --> 52:56.048
If you're so sure, why
haven't you just arrested me?

52:56.715 --> 52:59.843
Because I don't do check,
Light. Only checkmate.

53:00.636 --> 53:04.221
- But we'll be there soon enough.
- Great. Until then, enjoy the gelato.

53:04.223 --> 53:07.434
Assuming you can eat through
that thing. And I'll just, uh...

53:13.482 --> 53:14.525
Can I ask you something?

53:15.442 --> 53:16.276
Yeah.

53:18.278 --> 53:21.154
How do you think he does it? Kira.

53:21.156 --> 53:23.990
I was hoping you could shed
some light on that for me.

53:23.992 --> 53:25.492
I have a theory.

53:25.494 --> 53:28.245
I think that it's some
form of remote viewing

53:28.247 --> 53:31.623
coupled with maybe some latent psychic
ability of some sort. Am I close?

53:31.625 --> 53:34.209
So you really have no idea, do you?

53:34.211 --> 53:36.088
Well, I have several ideas.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.518
Eventually, you'll tell
me which is correct.

53:39.591 --> 53:42.092
What if it turned out
that all arresting Kira did

53:42.094 --> 53:46.054
was give that power to someone
else, someone potentially much worse.

53:46.056 --> 53:48.890
You're suggesting the ability
is somehow transferable.

53:48.892 --> 53:51.393
I'm suggesting maybe what you
and the person you're after want

53:51.395 --> 53:52.310
isn't so different.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.855
Maybe they're as ready to see
the killing end as you are.

53:54.857 --> 53:57.274
And if that were true, perhaps
now would be a good time

53:57.276 --> 53:59.445
to start helping them
instead of hunting them.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.365
Helping...

54:04.491 --> 54:05.701
Hmm...

54:07.953 --> 54:11.788
You know what I think, Light?
I think you want to make a deal.

54:11.790 --> 54:13.999
Good deals are made by those
in a position of strength.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.001
Criminals, such as yourself,
never make those deals.

54:16.003 --> 54:18.920
What they do is wait until
they're caught and then they beg.

54:18.922 --> 54:22.966
I'm not begging. I'm telling
you that you don't understand.

54:22.968 --> 54:25.304
Let me put this in terms
you're more familiar with.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.432
A man kills 400 people.

54:30.517 --> 54:33.977
He tells us that it's complicated,
that he's misunderstood.

54:33.979 --> 54:38.899
Do you think that Kira would hear
his excuses or walk him off a bridge?

54:38.901 --> 54:41.234
Think you're better than me,
but you're trying to kill Kira!

54:41.236 --> 54:43.904
- Kira, Kira, Kira!
- I do not kill, Light!

54:43.906 --> 54:45.864
I don't even carry a
gun, it's distracting.

54:45.866 --> 54:47.951
What I do is bring people to justice.

54:48.619 --> 54:52.954
But the form it takes is their own making.
A consequence of their actions, not mine.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.789
You're the one who flew into the sun.

54:54.791 --> 54:57.127
I'm just here to make
sure you actually burn.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.338
- Well, if that's how it has to be.
- It is, Light!

55:01.340 --> 55:04.801
You know that as well as I do.
There are no draws in this game.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.158
- Please, you have to forgive me.
- It was my dad, Mia.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.869
If I could take it back, I would.
I promise. I was just scared.

55:32.871 --> 55:35.082
Do you think I'm not scared?

55:36.750 --> 55:38.460
I'm a fucking cheerleader, Light.

55:39.127 --> 55:41.255
Nothing I do has ever
mattered until I met you.

55:42.422 --> 55:44.841
I made a mistake. If I could
take it back, I would. I just...

55:46.134 --> 55:48.011
I wasn't ready to lose you.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.016
I love you.

56:01.650 --> 56:02.651
I love you.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.869
L showed me his face.

56:14.871 --> 56:17.416
I'm gonna get his name,
and I'm gonna stop him.

56:23.088 --> 56:25.589
That's Watari. He's L's right-hand man.

56:25.591 --> 56:28.010
If anybody's gonna give us L's
real name, it's gonna be him.

56:31.179 --> 56:32.014
All right.

56:33.599 --> 56:34.973
"Watari becomes obsessed

56:34.975 --> 56:37.936
with revealing the true identity
of the detective known as 'L.'

56:38.645 --> 56:41.730
For the next 48 hours, he will cease
all communication with the outside world,

56:41.732 --> 56:47.193
except to update what he learns
to the number 206-555-0166.

56:47.195 --> 56:51.656
At 7:00 p.m., on October 12th, he dies."

56:51.658 --> 56:53.366
You didn't say how he dies.

56:53.368 --> 56:55.285
- It doesn't matter, it's dealer's choice.
- What?

56:55.287 --> 56:57.912
Huh? Oh, I was talking to Ryuk. Sorry.

56:57.914 --> 57:00.999
- So kill his friend to get his name?
- No, I'm not gonna kill Watari.

57:01.001 --> 57:02.626
That's the best part.

57:02.628 --> 57:04.294
Rule 89 says:

57:04.296 --> 57:06.463
"If the person who writes
a name destroys its page

57:06.465 --> 57:09.841
prior to the death being carried
out, the target will be spared."

57:09.843 --> 57:13.013
So if I burn Watari's page
before October 12th at 7:00 p.m...

57:13.764 --> 57:15.722
then nothing bad happens, right, Ryuk?

57:15.724 --> 57:19.476
Only one name can be removed
from the Death Note by burning it.

57:19.478 --> 57:22.731
Get this one wrong, you
won't get another chance.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.732
I only get one page to burn.

57:34.534 --> 57:36.368
- Hello?
- My name is Watari.

57:36.370 --> 57:40.038
- This information is not known to me.
- I'm sorry. What do you mean?

57:40.040 --> 57:41.831
I took responsibility for L

57:41.833 --> 57:45.377
only after he left the St.
Martin's orphanage in Montauk

57:45.379 --> 57:48.129
where he was one of the Rochester wards.

57:48.131 --> 57:50.173
One of the... Sorry,
what is a Rochester ward?

57:50.175 --> 57:52.175
They were orphans
trained since childhood

57:52.177 --> 57:55.720
to become the greatest detectives
the world had ever seen.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.806
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- I am not.

57:57.808 --> 58:01.728
For their first test, the wards
were placed in a conditioning vault.

58:02.396 --> 58:05.188
Those who retained their
sanity after seven months

58:05.190 --> 58:07.399
were initiated into the program.

58:07.401 --> 58:11.069
L joined at six, the
youngest candidate ever.

58:11.071 --> 58:14.781
Okay, but what was his name
before the vault or whatever?

58:14.783 --> 58:17.492
That name exists now
only in their records.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.829
Okay. Okay. Watari, you
need to go there right now.

58:20.831 --> 58:22.455
I should like to rest first.

58:22.457 --> 58:26.209
Sleep is key to strong thought.

58:26.211 --> 58:29.713
No. You don't have any time to sleep.
You have 48 hours to get a name.

58:29.715 --> 58:32.173
What happens in 48 hours?

58:32.175 --> 58:34.261
- You just need to go right now.
- I will go.

58:36.930 --> 58:39.891
- Leave him alive, it's a loose end.
- You don't need to help, Mia.

58:41.435 --> 58:42.477
Of course I do.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.731
I'm not gonna leave you alone in this.

58:48.942 --> 58:52.027
Continental America
from Seattle to New York

58:52.029 --> 58:54.322
will be departing from track three.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.761
I'm telling you, I
wore an actual top hat.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.848
- And was that with your wife or...?
- No.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:05.100
Frankly, she wouldn't have been
caught within ten miles of me.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.229
I didn't get this cool until much later.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:12.398
Hello. Nice to meet you. Leave.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.109
What are you doing here?

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.551
We have a critical issue that
requires discussion immediately.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.697
- Kids, give us a couple minutes.
- Sure.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:20.824
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:22.325
Not you, Light.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:24.327
The discussion concerns you.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:25.205
How?

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:35.588
Watari has disappeared.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.590
I've known him my entire life.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:41.636
He has not, would not, could not leave
without me being sure of his plans.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.972
- Okay, let me make a call.
- What is it that you want?

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:47.100
- Sorry, I don't have any idea.
- I get that this has got you upset.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:48.562
Your son is Kira, James!

01:00:50.118 --> 01:00:51.283
What?

01:00:51.286 --> 01:00:53.857
Don't know why you haven't been
able to put one and one together,

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:55.608
even despite him
having spared your life,

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.527
but it does not speak well to
your deductive abilities at all.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.612
It's time to leave.

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:01.447
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Wanna fucking bet?

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:03.825
I have a search warrant
and a team of men outside.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:07.412
So, as I said, I will be staying.
You? You have managed a strong move.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:09.956
Now, provided that you
return Watari to me safely,

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:13.877
I'm willing to put your position
of strength into account.

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:16.254
I'm sorry about your friend.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.174
Damn it! You don't have...

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.633
You have crossed the line!

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.595
Force me to do the same and I
assure you you will not survive!

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:26.683
You threaten my son again,
I'll fucking kill you!

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.851
Get the fuck out of here!

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.272
Tear this place apart! Tear it apart!

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.606
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:35.609
Yeah.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.414
Has nothing to do with you, son.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.917
I knew he was off the minute I met him.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.671
You know what happens when they find it.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.423
It ends up my book again, Light.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:04.802
And guess what name I'm gonna suggest
we start with when I find it a new home?

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.559
Is there...

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.063
anything I need to know?

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.983
How do you do it?

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.694
- How you handle all this?
- What do you mean?

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:25.448
How do you handle having everybody
against you? You're screwed either way.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.909
Yeah, one way or another,
we're all in the middle.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.537
Things are never black and white.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.372
Sometimes you just...

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.918
you just have to choose
the lesser of two evils.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:58.024
♪ And the sky ♪

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.736

Hold onto your heart ♪

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:16.251
He's coming out of the house right
now. I want a car on him. Every move.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.970
- Hello.
- Where are you? What's taking so long?

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.597
- I'm on my way to St. Martin's.
- Well, how much longer?

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.850
I hope to find it within
the next few hours.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.560
Find it? You don't know where it is?

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:39.605
It was never intended to be a
place that was easily accessed.

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:40.775
Okay, just hurry.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.946
This is a reminder.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.615
Time is running out to purchase
your Winter Dance tickets.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:52.160
- Hey.
- This is for tonight.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:55.705
Also comes with this. You're
really gonna stand out.

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:57.790
You really think I give
a shit about Homecoming?

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.461
Look in the hat.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.718
They're never gonna stop following you.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.846
We're gonna end this once and for
all, but I need you to trust me.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.183
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.418
What do you want, Light?

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.212
You're not some sadist.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:11.259
There's always some flimsy
justification, some reason that...

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.433
Get me the New York field office. Now!

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:04.579
I've asked Brandon here to dance with
me for one. Is that cool with you?

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:41.365
Hey. Where are you?

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.618
I've located the records
room, but need more time.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.661
Only got a few minutes.
Is it there or not?

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:49.497
I am confident it is here,
but I cannot yet say where.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.586
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.
Forget it. Just forget it.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:58.591
No! Mia, what did you
do? Where's the page?

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:01.093
- Watari, you have to run right now! Okay?
- Watari!

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.470
You have to run away
as quick as you can!

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.348
- Someone's here.
- Okay...

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.515
Just go to them right now
and ask for their help.

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:11.687
I am obsessed with revealing
the true identity of...

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.606
Yes. It's here.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:16.402
- What does it say that it is?
- L's true name...

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:21.279
- What does it say? What is L's real name?
- Sir! Answer me!

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.533
Are you Watari?

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.243
- I am Watari.
- Watari.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.750
Fuck! Fuck!

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:36.252
Ah, you said dealer's choice.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:53.229
Why didn't you tell me
the page was missing?

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:56.273
But then what would you
and Mia have to talk about?

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:59.151
I told you I like her a lot, Light.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.718
I know you're probably upset...

01:11:05.245 --> 01:11:07.344
but if you freak out,
they're gonna be all over us,

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.849
- and that's not gonna end well.
- You killed him.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:14.437
No, Light.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.688
I saved you...

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.565
from yourself again.

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:23.194
Because every time things get hard,
you leave me to do the real stuff.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.737
Oh, my God, it was all you.

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:26.947
Ryuk never found a loophole.
You were the loophole.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.702
You don't get to feel
superior for being a pussy.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:38.252
I did what I had to do... to protect us.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.726
"Agent Raymond Young...

01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:58.020
will write the names of all the
other agents of the Kira task force

01:11:58.022 --> 01:12:02.608
in the Death Note, placing each of
their faces in his mind as he goes.

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.611
When he's done, he will join
them in climbing to a rooftop

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.990
and leaping to his death."

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:14.119
If you want out, you're out. All I
need is for you to give me the book.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:17.623
Are you insane? Do you think that I'd
ever let you near that thing again?

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:18.876
You didn't read it.

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.337
What did you do?

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:25.297
"Light Turner's heart
stops beating at midnight."

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.258
No... you're trying to kill me?

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.720
You're going to officially
pass the book to me.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.266
Then once I'm the keeper...

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.269
I'll burn your page.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:40.690
That's why I couldn't let you save
Watari. You can only burn one name and...

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:43.150
I wanted it to be yours.

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:46.320
There are so many fucking rules.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:54.078
Now go get my goddamn book.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:12.889
Did you find Watari?

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.310
This is Detective Turner.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:04.355
I want every unit looking
for the individual known as L.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.231
He should be considered
armed and dangerous.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:09.362
And I want my son put in protective
custody until he's located. Now!

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.938
Let's go! This way! Move, move!

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.240
Fuck!

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:32.445
Agh!

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.362
Be on the lookout for Light Turner,

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.698
last seen in the vicinity
of North Seattle High.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:53.591
Ah!

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.012
Ah!

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:19.700
Hey!

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:38.677
Hey, man!

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.895
Ah!

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:51.522
Light!

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.277
Hey, asshole!

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.031
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.425
Hey!

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:23.097
Hold it right there! Stop! Repeat...

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:29.270
Hey!

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.157
Whoa! Hey!

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:45.578
Hey!

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.764
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.400
- Light!
- Ah!

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:19.985
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:23.947
Didn't I clearly explain what would happen
if Watari wasn't safely returned to me?

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:27.034
Wait! You need to understand how it
works, okay? Or you can't stop it!

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.118
I couldn't stop it!

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.495
Death can be handed out
through a fucking calculus book!

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.332
- You're stalling!
- No, I'm not! I swear I'm not, okay?

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:35.544
I'm just gonna turn
around really slowly.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:39.521
Okay. I'm gonna reach into my bag.

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:43.258
Don't move! Do not move!

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.136
This man is Kira. I'm
working with law enforcement.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.265
In order to capture and eliminate...

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.187
Lord Kira.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.442
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:22.800
Out of my way!

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.184
Come on! Let's go! Come with me!

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.315
Where the fuck is the book, Light?

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:41.608
- Come on!
- We're actually closed, guys.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.735
Take us to the top! Nobody
else gets on, hear me?

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:45.112
Here. Want the book? Get in!

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:48.031
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Take us to the top! Now!

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:48.951
Hit the button!

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:08.846
We gotta stop doing this. We
gotta stop doing all of this.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.346
It's already done!

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:14.143
Let's run away together and
never use the Death Note again.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.439
I don't want to run away!

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.152
Now give me my fucking book, okay?

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.197
Take it! But...

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:32.703
just remember what it's done.
Not just out there, but to us.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.830
If you love me...

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.624
If you love me, then you gotta trust me.

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:40.792
Don't take the book.

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:42.379
Because if you do...

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:45.382
you'll never see me again.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.515
I love you so much.

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:55.476
You do?

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:00.604
- Light!
- Dad?

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:01.732
Light!

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.611
No!

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:07.863
What?

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:19.249
What?

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:21.710
What did you do?

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:36.431
You put my name in it, didn't you?

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:39.393
It was if you took the book. I
thought I could convince you not to.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:40.769
Are you kidding me, Light?

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.105
- You put my name in the book! I got mad.
- Are you kidding me?!

01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:45.609
You said you love me! I thought
you wouldn't take the book!

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:56.535
Light!

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.588
Light! Light!

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.092
Oh, shit!

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:13.554
Ryuk! I take it back! I take it back!

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.562
Here, just hold on! Don't let go!

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.162
Please don't let me
go! Don't let me fall!

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.505
Four new killings.

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:41.509
And every one of them identified by
the news media in the last 48 hours.

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:44.346
I understand you think this
means Light cannot be Kira.

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:46.473
You think he's knocking
people off while in a coma?

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.391
I'm not exactly sure how it is...

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:53.106
Apparently, you have enough highly-placed
allies to keep you out of jail.

01:25:57.944 --> 01:26:01.531
But none of that's gonna
help you if we see you around.

01:26:57.629 --> 01:27:00.048
Was there a calculus book
seized at Light Turner's house?

01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:10.517
Don't take off!

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:55.393
Come in.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:05.071
Hey, Dad.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:22.672
What's wrong?

01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:27.177
It was you.

01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:33.099
All along.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.274
What are you talking about?

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:45.195
In your room.

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:55.912
At first, I couldn't figure out how
or why it'd gotten out of my safe.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:56.957
Then it hit me.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.877
James Brode wasn't the first victim.

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:04.297
It was Antony Skomal.

01:29:14.516 --> 01:29:15.849
How?

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.106
Do you really want to know?

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:28.820
Dr. Norman Ludlam,

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:32.532
known for sexually assaulting
female patients under sedation.

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:35.660
On the night of October 12th,
Norman Ludlam is present at the pier

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:38.748
when two individuals fall from
the Northwest Ferris Wheel.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:42.542
He rescues the male
suspect from the water

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:45.088
and manages to revive
him, saving his life.

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.300
Using his connections at the hospital,

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:54.347
Ludlam keeps the suspect in a
medically-induced coma for two days.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:57.390
At the end of this period,

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.936
he leaps to his death from
the roof of the hospital.

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.858
Aaron Peltz. Mailman, retired.

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:10.864
Molested nearly a dozen children
over the span of 20 years.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:14.826
Peltz retrieves the Death Note
from the river on October 12th.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:20.330
Each night, Peltz fills in the
blanks with the name of criminals

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.416
who appear on the news.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:26.544
On day two, he returns the
Death Note to the Kira suspect,

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:27.546
and then commits suicide.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:50.070
Mia Sutton is killed when she accepts
the Death Note from her boyfriend.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.324
As the Northwest Ferris Wheel
mysteriously collapses...

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:58.411
she pulls the page with my
name on it from the note.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:01.706
And it is ultimately consumed by fire.

01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:05.792
Although her boyfriend
lands safely in the water...

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:07.337
Mia strikes the shoreline...

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:09.295
dying instantly.

01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:27.230
I made a lot of mistakes.

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:30.276
And then I tried to fix
them, but it didn't work.

01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:33.945
I thought it was simple at first: I
was just gonna kill all the bad guys

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:36.489
and the good guys would
win, but it wasn't like that.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.530
It's like you said...

01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:20.368
sometimes you gotta choose
the lesser of the two evils.

01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:23.246
Which one are you, son?

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.426
What?

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:42.180
You humans are so interesting.
