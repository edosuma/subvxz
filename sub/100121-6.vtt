SO HAVE YOU.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.846
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:02.890 --> 09:04.587
ABOUT THE MONITOR DROPPING
ME INTO SOME SORT

09:04.631 --> 09:07.242
OF ALTERNATE REALITY
T-T-TIME LOOP
OR SOMETHING,

09:07.285 --> 09:08.852
WHERE EVERYTHING
IS DIFFERENT,

09:08.896 --> 09:10.462
WHERE LANCE IS
STILL ALIVE.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.160
OLIVER, LANCE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ALIVE.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.292
NO, HE HASN'T.
YOU JUST DON'T REMEMBER

09:14.336 --> 09:16.991
BECAUSE THE MONITOR
HAS DONE SOMETHING
TO PEOPLE'S MEMORIES,

09:17.034 --> 09:18.993
BUT I--I THINK I KNOW
THE WAY OUT OF THIS,

09:19.036 --> 09:22.866
BUT I--I NEED TO STOP
A BOMB AT THE SCPD.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.738
OLIVER, WILL YOU JUST
CALM DOWN, MAN?

09:24.781 --> 09:27.305
IF THERE WAS A BOMB,
WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.742
LYLA WOULD KNOW
ABOUT IT.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.004
LYLA'S A PART OF THIS.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.658
LYLA: PART OF WHAT?

09:31.701 --> 09:33.007
JOHN: OLIVER SEEMS TO
THINK THAT HE'S CAUGHT

09:33.050 --> 09:34.486
IN SOME SORT
OF TIME LOOP.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.792
IF WE'RE TRAVELING
BACK IN TIME,

09:35.836 --> 09:37.315
I'D LIKE TO REVISIT
MY 20S.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.708
I--I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH QUENTIN.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.668

FOR ME.

09:41.711 --> 09:42.886

09:42.930 --> 09:45.541
MR. MAYOR.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.456
OH. HEY, OLIVER.

LAST-MINUTE CHANGES
TO THE SPEECH, SO--

-WE NEED TO TALK.
-SURE. LET'S.

RUN THESE CHANGES
BY YOU ANYWAY.

A JOKE ABOUT SLABSIDE,

09:58.467 --> 10:00.861
ABOUT HOW I WOULD
RATHER SPEND TIME

10:00.904 --> 10:03.820

THAN TAKE YOUR ADVICE.

OF MY SPEECH

EXACT CONVERSATION ALREADY.

10:09.391 --> 10:13.308
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

10:13.351 --> 10:16.659
FULLY AWARE OF HOW
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND.

10:16.703 --> 10:21.359
QUENTIN, I AM TRAPPED
IN SOME SORT OF...
TIME LOOP,

10:21.403 --> 10:25.146

JUST KEEP REPEATING
THEMSELVES.

BELIEVE ME?

ONE DAUGHTER DIE

10:41.205 --> 10:42.729
AND COME BACK
TO LIFE TWICE.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.818

COME FROM SOME
OTHER EARTH.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.777
I'VE SEEN A GUY
IN RED RUN SO FAST
HE CAN REVERSE TIME.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.693
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
OUTSIDE THE NORM,
IS IT?

10:50.737 --> 10:53.696
ALSO, I'M DONE
LEARNING MY LESSON
ABOUT DOUBTING YOU

10:53.740 --> 10:56.481

ALWAYS BITES ME
IN THE ASS. HEH.

GONNA LEARN THAT

11:02.966 --> 11:05.708
THERE IS A HOSTAGE SITUATION
AT THE SCPD.

11:05.752 --> 11:09.799
THEY'RE GOING TO INSIST
THAT THEY TALK TO YOU
AND ONLY YOU.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.932
AND HOW DOES IT
GO SOUTH?

11:11.975 --> 11:14.021
THERE'S A HIDDEN
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

11:14.064 --> 11:16.284
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
THE FIRST TIME THROUGH,

11:16.327 --> 11:19.330
AND JUDGING FROM THE BLAST,
IT'S UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.594
EH. SO YOU FIND IT,
YOU KEEP US
FROM GOING BOOM.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.814
-WHAT THEN?
-I BREAK OUT OF THE LOOP.

THAT THE GREEN ARROW
CALLED IN A BOMB THREAT,

HE CALL ME?"

HAS ME TRAPPED
IN A TIME LOOP.
