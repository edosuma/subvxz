WEBVTT

00:11.102 --> 00:14.654
DESHAWN: You guys got messy,
again, for the second

00:14.757 --> 00:15.930
-Tribal in a row.
-I've been...

00:16.033 --> 00:17.205
Just do what we said
we were gonna do.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.620
I don't understand it.

00:21.550 --> 00:22.757
-And I was like, "Really."
-Heather, Heather,

00:22.861 --> 00:24.103
-I love you to pieces.
-"Sit down and be quiet."

00:24.205 --> 00:25.344
Heather, Heather, Heather,
I love you to pieces,

00:25.448 --> 00:27.033
but right now
I just need a minute.

00:27.137 --> 00:29.172
-Got it, but...
-What you did-- it was...
it was a little messy.

00:29.274 --> 00:30.827
All right?
So I just need a minute.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.033
Tribal Council was

00:32.137 --> 00:34.481
absolutely a train wreck.

00:34.585 --> 00:37.965
The plan was picture perfect,
but Heather stands up,

00:38.067 --> 00:40.585
and she whispers
in a few different people's ear,

00:40.689 --> 00:43.723
blows up the entire thing, and
then Shan says, "Vote Heather."

00:43.826 --> 00:45.274
I didn't want to vote Heather,
so I said no,

00:45.378 --> 00:47.274
and she jumped down my throat.

00:47.378 --> 00:48.723
So now Shan is starting

00:48.826 --> 00:50.206
to step on my toes.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.758
You're starting to get in
the way of my million dollars,

00:51.862 --> 00:53.103
so that started
to piss me off a lot.

00:53.206 --> 00:55.310
Every time
that she has an opinion,

00:55.412 --> 00:57.000
like, "Let's vote Heather,"

00:57.103 --> 00:59.723
y'all sitting there looking
like y'all have nothing to say.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.344
-Well... hold up.
-Why does nobody speak up?

01:01.448 --> 01:02.965
SHAN:
It was like a whole
dramatic moment.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.551
It just didn't have
to be all that.

01:04.655 --> 01:06.585
Why am I bending backwards
for this dude?

01:06.688 --> 01:08.448
He's more loyal
and more with them

01:08.551 --> 01:12.000
than he is here, and that...
I don't understand that.

01:12.102 --> 01:13.481
Everybody was like,

01:13.585 --> 01:14.655
"Yes, let's vote Heather,"
except for Deshawn.

01:14.757 --> 01:16.137
So we go back

01:16.240 --> 01:18.516
to the original plan because
that's what Deshawn wanted.

01:19.655 --> 01:21.000
Then he pouts, then he sulks.

01:21.103 --> 01:23.896
That, to me, is immature, so

01:24.000 --> 01:25.240
I just can't
with Deshawn anymore.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.067
Shan is like a bulldozer
when it comes to her strategy.

01:33.171 --> 01:36.171
I don't like to let people
tell me what to do in this game.

01:36.275 --> 01:38.137
I came here to play,

01:38.240 --> 01:39.481
and I'm not gonna
stop playing now

01:39.585 --> 01:41.481
because Shan is telling
the group what to do.

01:41.585 --> 01:42.688
It's just not gonna happen.

01:42.793 --> 01:43.965
-I...
-This isn't your Survivor.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.275
I'm gonna play it the way
I want to play it.

01:45.378 --> 01:47.171
Like, I wish I would leave
this show because

01:47.275 --> 01:48.585
I freaking made the decision

01:48.688 --> 01:50.240
that you wanted me
to make, haphazardly.

01:50.343 --> 01:51.896
-You didn't think about it.
-Yeah. I...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.826
-And now look at you--
egg on your face. I'm done.
-Yeah.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.137
EVVIE:
Coming back
from Tribal Council,

01:56.240 --> 01:58.826
there were fireworks here
on our beach.

01:58.930 --> 02:01.000
And that's fine with me because

02:01.102 --> 02:02.551
things are gonna shake up
around here.

02:07.034 --> 02:09.586
-ERIKA: Well, I was like...
-EVVIE: Chaos doesn't

02:09.688 --> 02:10.655
help the people in power.

02:10.758 --> 02:12.068
Chaos helps the bottom people.

02:12.171 --> 02:15.448
So this cast is amazing for me.

02:19.896 --> 02:21.931
â™ª

02:23.550 --> 02:25.413
LIANA:
Oh, look at this beautiful sun.

02:25.516 --> 02:27.516
ERIKA: These are the moments
we have to enjoy

02:27.620 --> 02:30.758
-despite the craziness.
-LIANA: Yup.

02:30.861 --> 02:32.723
It was not the way
things was supposed to go.

02:32.826 --> 02:35.620
And I have to apologize to you
that I have to realize

02:35.723 --> 02:38.930
I got to push through when
people don't communicate with me

02:39.033 --> 02:40.378
the way I need them
to communicate.

02:40.481 --> 02:42.171
So there is validity
to your points.

02:42.275 --> 02:43.793
So I am...
I'm sorry that you don't

02:43.896 --> 02:45.620
feel always heard by me.
That's something

02:45.723 --> 02:47.310
that I want to work on,
even in this game.

02:47.413 --> 02:49.343
I want you
to feel always heard.

02:49.448 --> 02:51.240
It was a good talk
that Deshawn and I had.

02:51.343 --> 02:53.481
I'm glad that we were able to
kind of repair that a bit, and

02:53.586 --> 02:56.033
I don't want to seem like I'm
the one calling all the shots,

02:56.137 --> 02:59.758
so, you know, I need to listen
to all the opinions, but also,

02:59.861 --> 03:01.343
getting the way
I want the vote to go.

03:04.378 --> 03:06.481
-Uh...
-And I can tell you,
Erika more so than Heather

03:06.586 --> 03:08.310
'cause Erika's the mastermind.

03:08.413 --> 03:10.620
-Um... yeah.
-I don't trust Erika
and Heather.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.481
DESHAWN:
I was just trying
to smooth things over with Shan,

03:13.586 --> 03:17.586
but yet again, she was just kind
of telling me what to do. Like,

03:17.688 --> 03:19.343
she has very little tact.

03:19.448 --> 03:23.137
I think that the group
of Ricard, Shan, Liana, Danny,

03:23.240 --> 03:25.516
and I guess myself-- finicky--

03:25.620 --> 03:27.826
I think the group
is already dissipating.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.378
-...it's, like, back and forth.
We can communicate.
-Yes, yes.

03:31.481 --> 03:33.137
-I don't...
-I know.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.758
DESHAWN:
So right now I'm just trying

03:34.861 --> 03:36.067
to play the middle.

03:36.171 --> 03:37.965
I have to have conversations
with Evvie because

03:38.067 --> 03:39.930
I feel like we can do
some damage together.

03:41.965 --> 03:43.171
-And likewise.
-Yeah.

03:43.275 --> 03:44.758
-Deal...
-Deal...

03:46.620 --> 03:49.378
-How many is that?
-This will be 17.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.240
Just want to tell you I'm not
upset with you or something.

03:53.343 --> 03:55.240
Okay? It's a... That's...
Yesterday is gone.

03:55.343 --> 03:56.861
Today is a new day.

04:00.586 --> 04:01.931
I did not write your name.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.655
Okay. And you throw my name
under the bus for sure.

04:06.861 --> 04:07.895
Okay, that's fine.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.481
Yeah, I know.
You don't believe...

04:10.586 --> 04:11.758
-I did not write your name.
-XANDER: I know

04:11.861 --> 04:13.723
for a fact
that Heather didn't vote

04:13.826 --> 04:16.620
for Naseer
because it was me, but

04:16.723 --> 04:18.586
I'm keeping my mouth shut.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.757
It's great to stir up chaos
when you're on the bottom.

04:20.862 --> 04:23.481
It's perfect that they're
fighting with each other.

04:25.310 --> 04:28.033
-I was like,
"Something is wrong."
-Do I buy that? I don't.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.413
I don't buy it.

04:29.516 --> 04:30.826
What part don't you buy?

04:30.930 --> 04:32.757
I don't buy anything
that you say now.

04:32.862 --> 04:34.481
It doesn't matter.

04:36.896 --> 04:38.481
Ask Evvie who she was told
to vote for.

04:38.586 --> 04:40.343
Here, Evvie.
Can I ask you a question?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.343
-Yes. Yes.
-When I asked you
on your shoulder,

04:42.447 --> 04:43.516
knocked on your shoulder,

04:43.620 --> 04:44.654
-I said "Who are you...?"
-Oh, yeah.

04:44.757 --> 04:47.137
At Tribal, you said,
"Vote Naseer."

04:48.274 --> 04:51.447
I-I didn't say, "Vote for him."
I said... You said, "Naseer."

04:51.550 --> 04:55.413
HEATHER:
Last Tribal, I got caught
trying to scramble.

04:57.379 --> 04:59.793
-Wow.
-HEATHER: Oh,
it totally backfired.

04:59.896 --> 05:03.103
I ended up with a big old...
on my back.

05:03.206 --> 05:05.620
So, yeah, yeah, I got... I got

05:05.723 --> 05:07.274
a little lecture today.

05:08.930 --> 05:09.964
-Got it.
-Thank you.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.274
You're welcome.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.516
[groans]

05:15.826 --> 05:17.689
What a lovely family.

05:18.689 --> 05:21.206
NASEER:
Oh, that looks good.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.516
-SHAN: Bon appÃ©tit.
-EVVIE: Amazing.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.343
Uh, I'm so excited.

05:25.447 --> 05:27.343
ERIKA:
So you lost, like, hearing
in your right side,

05:27.447 --> 05:28.793
like, not when you were born.
It was, like,

05:28.896 --> 05:30.550
-something that happened.
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:30.654 --> 05:33.689
-So do you normally, like,
wear your hearing aids?
-No.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.240
Because of my job,
there's so much

05:35.343 --> 05:36.930
ambient noise,
it's really hard for me.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.826
I don't really
wear it often, but...

05:40.000 --> 05:41.896
Oh, I'm fully deaf in
my right ear, and I read lips.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.379
-Wow.
-Wow.

05:43.481 --> 05:44.826
RICARD:
Most people don't realize

05:44.930 --> 05:46.343
I'm hard of hearing, but

05:46.447 --> 05:47.757
since I was a kid, I've been

05:47.862 --> 05:49.481
fully deaf in my right ear.

05:49.586 --> 05:52.481
At times, that can be very
frustrating and very annoying.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.000
It-it just made me scared
coming into the game.

05:56.103 --> 05:57.274
[indistinct, muffled chatter]

05:57.379 --> 05:58.516
EVVIE:
Where's the button?

05:58.620 --> 06:00.172
[indistinct, muffled chatter]

06:03.343 --> 06:05.033
Good-good for you. I'm okay.

06:05.137 --> 06:07.206
But I'm really thriving.

06:07.310 --> 06:09.481
[indistinct, muffled chatter]

06:09.586 --> 06:11.620
That went in
and it'll be like, "Poof."

06:11.723 --> 06:14.654
And then you want some, like,
rice to cool it down, too.

06:14.757 --> 06:16.896
RICARD:
Reading body language
and reading lips--

06:17.000 --> 06:19.723
I tune out everything else,
and I just see it all,

06:19.826 --> 06:21.274
like, appearing in front of me.

06:21.379 --> 06:24.516
This game is really testing me,
but I've really been blossoming.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.723
I think I'm just kicking ass,
and it just makes me think

06:28.826 --> 06:31.586
maybe I can be the first
hard-of-hearing winner.

06:31.689 --> 06:34.516
And I'm in a really good spot
Day 17.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.274
SHAN:
I felt like,
for the first time last night,

06:36.379 --> 06:38.067
I just knocked out

06:38.172 --> 06:39.516
-and was...
-DANNY: It went long.

06:39.620 --> 06:40.862
-SHAN: Yeah.
-But, yeah, day 17.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.516
-Right?
-EVVIE: Just think there...

06:50.172 --> 06:51.793
SHAN:
Yeah.

06:57.172 --> 06:58.550
ERIKA:
Like, are you serious?

06:58.654 --> 06:59.826
You don't even see
that we're, like,

06:59.930 --> 07:01.757
-right there?
-I guess they think

07:01.862 --> 07:04.862
that, like, all the people
on the bottom are so scattered

07:04.964 --> 07:07.172
that we could never
work together.

07:13.103 --> 07:14.067
-LIANA: Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.654
-Oh, yes.
-SHAN: Yes, yes, yes.

07:21.343 --> 07:22.723
Not and, like, be low-key.

07:22.826 --> 07:25.274
I don't trust Erika,
not with some...

07:25.379 --> 07:27.413
-There's something off there.
-Right.

07:27.516 --> 07:31.930
You think maybe we should be
voting either Shan or Ricard?

07:32.033 --> 07:34.654
-Maybe.
-Like, could we do...?

07:34.757 --> 07:36.240
Could we pull in Naseer
as a number and tell him

07:36.343 --> 07:38.343
-we're voting Erika and Xander?
-LIANA: Yeah.

07:40.965 --> 07:42.689
Xander's been a problem for me
for a really long time.

07:42.793 --> 07:46.793
He continues to make it this far
with the idol in his pocket.

07:46.896 --> 07:47.930
It just makes it

07:48.033 --> 07:49.343
more apparent
how much of a threat

07:49.447 --> 07:52.343
he is in this game and how much
he does need to go.

07:52.447 --> 07:54.274
What if we did...

07:54.379 --> 07:55.896
I think it's better.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.172
Everyone's obsessed
with Xander

07:57.274 --> 07:58.723
because he's got the idol, but

07:58.826 --> 08:00.413
I want to get rid of Erika.

08:00.516 --> 08:02.586
I feel like she's probably
one of the smarter players

08:02.689 --> 08:04.586
in the game,
and I don't trust her.

08:04.689 --> 08:05.689
Not even a little bit.

08:16.862 --> 08:18.550
Come on in.

08:27.137 --> 08:30.930
All right, let's get to today's
immunity challenge.

08:31.033 --> 08:34.033
First things first, Evvie.
Take back the necklace.

08:35.517 --> 08:37.240
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:37.344 --> 08:42.172
Once again,
immunity is back up for grabs.

08:42.274 --> 08:44.067
For today's challenge,
you're going to balance

08:44.172 --> 08:46.620
on a very narrow perch
with your hands

08:46.724 --> 08:49.206
holding onto a handle
behind your head.

08:49.309 --> 08:51.826
If at any point,
a hand comes off the handle

08:51.931 --> 08:55.931
or a foot comes off the perch...

08:56.033 --> 08:57.379
you're out.

08:57.481 --> 08:58.861
And to make it
a little more interesting,

08:58.965 --> 09:02.344
today, we're going
to divide you into two groups.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.758
-Oh, my gosh.
-PROBST: So,

09:04.861 --> 09:09.758
two people will win immunity,
be safe.

09:09.861 --> 09:11.688
Both groups will go
to Tribal Council

09:11.793 --> 09:13.379
-separately
and vote somebody out.
-EVVIE: Ah, man.

09:13.481 --> 09:14.965
-[others murmuring]
-So two winners,

09:15.067 --> 09:17.654
-two people going home.
-Oh, gosh.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.654
In addition, playing for reward.

09:19.758 --> 09:20.793
Want to know what
you're playing for?

09:20.895 --> 09:22.102
-[whooping]
-XANDER: Let's see it.

09:22.206 --> 09:24.240
PROBST:
The last person left standing

09:24.344 --> 09:27.793
in the challenge not only earns
immunity for themselves,

09:27.895 --> 09:29.586
but you earn chicken
and beef stew

09:29.688 --> 09:30.793
-for your group...
-Oh, man.

09:30.895 --> 09:33.481
to be enjoyed back at camp.

09:33.586 --> 09:36.309
We're going to draw for spots
to see which group you're in,

09:36.413 --> 09:37.758
and we'll get started.

09:37.861 --> 09:39.344
Gonna be a good one.

09:39.447 --> 09:40.413
[whooping]

09:40.517 --> 09:44.620
â™ª

09:44.724 --> 09:46.895
All right, everybody,
take your spots.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.274
Get your feet up on the perch

09:48.379 --> 09:50.517
and your hands
behind the handle.

09:50.620 --> 09:51.895
Your feet are facing out.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.517
[soft groans]

09:53.620 --> 09:55.172
PROBST:
Everybody get comfortable.

09:55.274 --> 09:57.481
-Ready?
-Heather's ready.
Is everybody ready?

09:57.586 --> 09:59.240
-Mm-hmm.
-Yup.
-Yup.

09:59.344 --> 10:03.344
Let's not waste any time.
This challenge is on.

10:04.344 --> 10:06.136
Two groups.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.620
It is Erika, Shan,

10:08.724 --> 10:12.481
Ricard, Naseer and Heather
competing against each other.

10:12.586 --> 10:15.654
In the other group,
we have Deshawn,

10:15.758 --> 10:19.551
Evvie, Liana, Xander and Danny.

10:19.654 --> 10:22.724
One person from each group
will be going home.

10:24.481 --> 10:28.517
This is about pain management
'cause it's gonna hurt.

10:37.826 --> 10:39.861
[wooden creaking]

10:43.379 --> 10:45.481
I've watched people do this
over the years.

10:45.586 --> 10:47.136
I know it's hurting already.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.931
This is not a comfortable spot.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.758
Everybody hurts
in this challenge.

10:53.033 --> 10:55.172
You just keep fighting because

10:55.274 --> 10:59.206
you never know when the person
next to you is going to drop.

10:59.309 --> 11:02.000
-Jeff.
-PROBST: Evvie drops out.

11:02.102 --> 11:04.000
You can take a spot
on the bench over here.

11:04.102 --> 11:06.206
Evvie-- first out.

11:06.309 --> 11:07.758
Ooh.

11:08.826 --> 11:10.688
-[wooden creaking]
-PROBST: Shan literally

11:10.793 --> 11:12.931
shaking, but still up there.

11:13.033 --> 11:14.379
[Heather exhales sharply]

11:16.344 --> 11:18.481
-Oh, God.
-PROBST: Heather drops.

11:18.586 --> 11:20.517
Liana drops.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.481
-Oh!

-EVVIE: You got it, Xander.

11:22.586 --> 11:24.758
PROBST:
Shan is out, and just like that,

11:24.861 --> 11:26.551
we're down to three in yellow.

11:26.654 --> 11:28.586
It's Erika, Ricard and Naseer.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.965
And we're three on blue--

11:31.067 --> 11:34.620
Deshawn, Xander and Danny.

11:34.724 --> 11:36.654
-Ooh.
-LIANA: You got it, Danny.

11:36.758 --> 11:38.033
I'm not dropping.

11:38.136 --> 11:40.620
-I'm not, either.
-[laughs]

11:42.861 --> 11:46.000
Guys, I can stay two hours
if you want.

11:46.102 --> 11:47.517
-Let's do it.
-NASEER: Let's do it.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.517
SHAN:
You're looking great, guys.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.517
HEATHER:
Good job, guys.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.379
You're looking great, Naseer.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.517
[rattling]

11:55.620 --> 11:58.136
-PROBST: Danny suddenly drops.
-[groans]

11:58.240 --> 12:00.931
He went
until he could not anymore.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.826
We're down to two in blue.

12:03.931 --> 12:08.136
It is Deshawn and Xander,
fighting for immunity, and it is

12:08.240 --> 12:11.586
Erika, Ricard
and Naseer for yellow.

12:11.688 --> 12:13.517
SHAN:
You got it, Ricard.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.379
-You got it.
-[wooden creaking]

12:16.758 --> 12:19.000
PROBST:
Ricard drops out
and into the sand.

12:19.102 --> 12:21.136
-EVVIE: Good job, Ricard.
-DANNY: Yeah, Ricard. Good job.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.274
-LIANA: Good job.
-PROBST: We're down

12:22.379 --> 12:24.826
to a showdown
on yellow and blue.

12:24.931 --> 12:27.517
It is a showdown
between Erika and Naseer,

12:27.620 --> 12:30.172
and a showdown
between Deshawn and Xander.

12:30.274 --> 12:32.965
The stew! The stew!

12:33.067 --> 12:36.000
PROBST:
Immunity andstew on the line.

12:36.102 --> 12:37.688
Bring it home, Naseer.
You got it.

12:37.793 --> 12:40.758
-I promise you.
-PROBST:
You'll be a hero who is safe.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.344
Best place to be in this game.

12:42.447 --> 12:44.102
SHAN:
Hold on, Naseer.

12:44.206 --> 12:45.931
I can't feel my right hand.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.586
-Naseer, calm, maintain.
-Hold on.

12:47.688 --> 12:49.000
-Calm down.
-PROBST:
Naseer really struggling.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.000
-No, I'm not, Jeff.
-Naseer, get your hand

12:51.102 --> 12:53.413
-on the back of that,
not the cap.
-I can't feel it.

12:53.517 --> 12:56.240
Sorry. You got to move it,
or I'll call you out.

12:57.274 --> 12:59.586
PROBST:
On the back of it.
Your hand, right hand.

12:59.688 --> 13:02.309
-I can't feel it.
-PROBST: Naseer is out.
Don't drop.

13:02.413 --> 13:05.758
-Erika wins individual immunity.
-[indistinct chatter]

13:05.861 --> 13:08.551
Erika is safe tonight
at her Tribal Council.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.413
She's now trying
to win chicken and beef Stew.

13:10.517 --> 13:12.861
She can't do it.

13:12.965 --> 13:16.586
ERIKA:
I'm sorry, guys, sorry.

13:16.688 --> 13:18.379
-Keep grinding.
-Erika is safe, but we now know

13:18.481 --> 13:20.931
that blue will have chicken
and beef stew.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.102
Oh, hey, we got the stew, man.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.793
-We got it.
-PROBST: The question is,

13:23.895 --> 13:25.067
who will have
the immunity necklace

13:25.172 --> 13:26.724
while they are enjoying it?

13:26.826 --> 13:29.000
-We're feasting for sure.
-Yup.

13:29.102 --> 13:30.551
-I'm sorry
I couldn't go on, guys.
-No, it's okay.

13:30.654 --> 13:32.172
It's okay.
You hung up there as a girl.

13:32.274 --> 13:34.517
-You did so good.
-PROBST: Deshawn fighting

13:34.620 --> 13:37.240
through obvious pain,
but he is fighting through it.

13:37.344 --> 13:39.206
ERIKA:
You're both looking good.

13:39.309 --> 13:41.620
-Keep going.
-PROBST: Five feet to his left--

13:41.724 --> 13:44.000
Xander.

13:52.688 --> 13:54.033
PROBST:
Xander's body's starting

13:54.136 --> 13:56.102
to shake a little bit,
starting to twitch.

14:04.688 --> 14:06.206
Yeah.

14:07.895 --> 14:09.931
[wooden creaking]

14:26.136 --> 14:30.688
It's the last showdown--
Deshawn and Xander.

14:30.793 --> 14:32.551
-For immunity.
-NASEER: Doing good, boys.

14:32.654 --> 14:33.654
ERIKA:
Keep going, boys.

14:33.758 --> 14:35.274
-Keep going.
-[wooden creaking]

14:35.379 --> 14:37.517
-Come on, Deshawn.
-Keep going.
-Doing great.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.793
PROBST:
Xander's fighting through it,
still twitching

14:40.895 --> 14:42.758
but still strong.

14:42.861 --> 14:44.688
When you win Survivor,

14:44.793 --> 14:46.895
you can look back and say,
"I earned

14:47.000 --> 14:50.551
-every minute in this game."
-[groans softly]

14:50.654 --> 14:55.136
"Even challenges I didn't win,
I gave everything in the tank."

14:58.481 --> 14:59.654
ERIKA:
Keep going. Keep going.

14:59.758 --> 15:00.724
-LIANA: You got it, guys.
-You guys have

15:00.826 --> 15:02.344
all you need to win. Keep going.

15:02.447 --> 15:04.688
-PROBST:
You're at 33 minutes.
-SHAN: You got it.

15:04.793 --> 15:07.481
You got it, Deshawn.
You've got it, Xander.

15:07.586 --> 15:08.895
-ERIKA: Keep going, guys.
-SHAN: Looking great.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.067
You guys are both
looking great up there.

15:10.172 --> 15:11.895
PROBST:
That a way to fight, you guys.

15:20.895 --> 15:23.000
-SHAN: Oh!
-PROBST: Deshawn drops out.

15:23.102 --> 15:27.481
Xander wins individual immunity
and reward for his group.

15:27.586 --> 15:29.067
What an effort. Take a break

15:29.172 --> 15:30.793
-in the sand if you need it.
-Good job, guys.

15:30.895 --> 15:33.344
Both guys trying
to find their bodies again.

15:33.447 --> 15:35.758
[applause]

15:35.861 --> 15:37.206
Huge effort.

15:37.309 --> 15:40.481
-Man, if I can get
my arms around you.
-Oh, man.

15:40.586 --> 15:44.620
-PROBST: Wow.
-[laughing]: Oh, my gosh.

15:44.724 --> 15:46.758
-PROBST: Wow.
-LIANA: Wow.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.033
Erika, come on over.

15:55.309 --> 15:57.206
Oh, my gosh.
Dream come true.

15:57.309 --> 15:59.654
Oh, my gosh. I've just dreamed
of this moment

15:59.758 --> 16:02.931
-since I was a kid.
-Congratulations.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.688
You fought hard. You've earned
individual immunity.

16:05.793 --> 16:08.517
You are not going home tonight.
Head back to your group because

16:08.620 --> 16:10.861
-somebody is going home.
-ERIKA: Thanks, Jeff.

16:10.965 --> 16:12.274
Xander, come on over.

16:12.379 --> 16:13.861
SHAN:
Xander.

16:13.965 --> 16:15.379
-Good job, Xander.
-PROBST: I was gonna say,

16:15.481 --> 16:16.620
"Did you dream
of this as a kid?"

16:16.724 --> 16:18.481
But you kind of are
still a young man.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.413
Yeah, I mean, oh, my God,
to have this moment.

16:21.517 --> 16:23.413
And, like, this challenge

16:23.517 --> 16:26.379
I've dreamed of so many nights.
Since it's aired,

16:26.481 --> 16:28.620
-like, this is made for me.
-PROBST: Congrats.

16:28.724 --> 16:30.172
Go ahead and head back, Xander.

16:30.274 --> 16:31.895
Good job.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.274
PROBST:
Heather, Naseer, Shan,

16:34.379 --> 16:36.067
Ricard, one of you going home
tonight.

16:36.172 --> 16:37.413
You know it won't be Erika.

16:37.517 --> 16:40.379
You're gonna go now
to the old Ua camp.

16:41.654 --> 16:43.033
Grab your stuff, head out.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.551
We'll see you tonight
at Tribal Council.

16:44.654 --> 16:47.240
You will go first
and vote somebody out.

16:47.344 --> 16:48.793
And then go back
to our real camp?

16:48.895 --> 16:50.240
Then you go back
to your real camp.

16:50.344 --> 16:52.000
-RICARD: Okay.
-Okay, that's good.

16:52.102 --> 16:54.136
Xander, Evvie, Liana,

16:54.240 --> 16:56.895
Danny, Deshawn, you will go
to Tribal Council second.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.654
Grab your stuff,
head back to camp.

16:58.758 --> 17:02.654
-Enjoy your well-earned reward.
-Thanks, Jeff.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.517
LIANA:
The fact that Xander won today,
I mean, it's just, like,

17:04.619 --> 17:05.517
so bad.

17:05.619 --> 17:07.378
He knows he has power

17:07.481 --> 17:10.586
on his neck,
and that's not good for my game.

17:10.689 --> 17:12.931
Every single draw,
it's like I'm with Xander.

17:13.034 --> 17:14.792
I'm like, what is going on
with this kid?

17:14.895 --> 17:16.586
Like, can I get some space?"

17:27.172 --> 17:28.413
EVVIE:
Oh, my God. This is so...

17:28.517 --> 17:29.689
Look how much food this is

17:29.792 --> 17:31.172
for the five of us.

17:31.275 --> 17:32.862
It's also perfect 'cause
you always talk about stew.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.758
-EVVIE: Yeah.
-XANDER: I know.

17:34.862 --> 17:37.000
This is, like,
all I've been dreaming about.

17:37.103 --> 17:39.205
I have been dreaming of stew.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.862
And, aw, it hit the spot.

17:42.964 --> 17:44.275
It does look good.

17:44.378 --> 17:46.758
-Are you ready to dig in?
-It does.

17:46.862 --> 17:50.000
XANDER:
I can't imagine a better day.
I have immunity.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.067
I also have an idol, and

17:52.172 --> 17:54.000
now that the numbers
are down to five,

17:54.103 --> 17:56.136
this is a huge opportunity
for me

17:56.240 --> 17:59.103
to take out the big dogs
on the top. Exactly what

17:59.205 --> 18:01.000
I've wanted to, or...

18:01.103 --> 18:02.654
[burps]

18:02.758 --> 18:05.964
Still digesting that stew.
[laughs]

18:06.067 --> 18:08.205
This is so ... good.

18:08.309 --> 18:09.654
It's unbelievable.

18:09.758 --> 18:11.448
EVVIE: Initially
just looking at the group,

18:11.550 --> 18:13.586
I thought that for sure
I would be in trouble.

18:13.689 --> 18:15.895
But the reality is,
Deshawn is really out

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
on the power group, so I think
for sure I have Deshawn, but

18:20.103 --> 18:21.723
Xander-- he and I have
had a bumpy road,

18:21.826 --> 18:23.862
especially the last couple days.

18:23.964 --> 18:25.000
So if Deshawn is with me

18:25.103 --> 18:26.413
and Xander's with me,
I should be fine.

18:37.413 --> 18:39.448
I mean...

18:41.895 --> 18:43.931
EVVIE:
Liana.

18:45.550 --> 18:46.448
Yeah.

18:46.550 --> 18:47.448
Liana's someone

18:47.550 --> 18:49.826
who's almost a minion to Shan,

18:49.931 --> 18:51.826
and that's so dangerous.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.136
Not only that.
She has no trust in me.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.517
She wants me gone. So,

18:56.619 --> 18:58.862
Liana would be fantastic
for me to get rid of.

19:14.826 --> 19:16.550
Yes.

19:16.654 --> 19:19.172
DANNY:
It's a simple vote.
Evvie is going home tonight.

19:19.275 --> 19:20.448
Fortunately,

19:20.550 --> 19:22.378
the luck of the draw gave us
three people

19:22.481 --> 19:23.862
that are in our alliance--

19:23.964 --> 19:25.000
me, Deshawn and Liana.

19:25.103 --> 19:27.000
With only five people,

19:27.103 --> 19:28.862
we have the power,
uh, in this vote.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.723
-This is the chance.
-I know.

19:33.826 --> 19:36.826
For me tonight,
I'm definitely writing Evvie,

19:36.931 --> 19:40.067
but my biggest worry is
Xander has an idol.

19:40.172 --> 19:43.000
If he were to potentially
play it for Evvie,

19:43.103 --> 19:45.826
that could be a huge problem.
I could go home tonight.

19:45.931 --> 19:47.309
What are you thinking?

19:47.413 --> 19:48.964
I want to hear the name
that you have.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.344
Most threatening--
between Evvie and Deshawn.

19:51.448 --> 19:52.931
XANDER:
Between Evvie and Deshawn?

19:53.034 --> 19:54.964
-LIANA: Yeah.
-Everybody

19:55.067 --> 19:56.448
wants Evvie out, though.

19:56.550 --> 19:59.344
-She's not someone
we have to worry about.
-Okay.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.964
I don't know.

20:04.067 --> 20:06.619
The hesitancy is,
you do have your idol.

20:06.723 --> 20:08.172
-Yeah.
-So...

20:08.275 --> 20:10.378
I'm definitely... I'm... I'll
have you know I'm considering.

20:12.413 --> 20:14.689
I woke up on the bottom.

20:14.792 --> 20:17.344
Now I'm the prom king, and
everybody wants to take me aside

20:17.448 --> 20:19.378
and give me advice in the game.

20:22.550 --> 20:24.344
Like...

20:27.275 --> 20:29.136
-You would do that?
-Well, I mean, not to you.

20:29.240 --> 20:32.448
It's a little funny to me
that Liana feels

20:32.550 --> 20:34.205
in a place to make demands.

20:34.309 --> 20:36.000
She's got a big target
on her back,

20:36.103 --> 20:39.481
and she knows it.
Liana has shown her cards,

20:39.586 --> 20:42.240
and I'm ready to expose them.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.136
XANDER:
They've got such
an interesting dynamic.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.964
EVVIE:
Uh, on the other group-- I know,
I was thinking about that.

20:48.067 --> 20:51.309
-Would be Naseer and, uh, Shan.
-Yeah, Shan.

20:51.413 --> 20:52.654
-EVVIE: Right?
-XANDER: Both have idols.

20:52.758 --> 20:54.240
-DESHAWN: Yeah.
-EVVIE: Yeah.

20:54.344 --> 20:56.275
EVVIE:
And Shan and Ricard together.

20:56.378 --> 20:58.792
XANDER: But Erika
and Heather are really close.
-EVVIE: Right.

20:58.895 --> 21:00.172
XANDER:
And then that leaves Naseer,

21:00.275 --> 21:01.517
and he's such a wild card.

21:01.619 --> 21:03.862
SHAN:
Well, it sucks being back at Ua.

21:03.964 --> 21:05.240
Man, our camp is much better.

21:05.344 --> 21:07.240
-I hate it here.
-SHAN: I hate this camp.

21:07.344 --> 21:10.205
Erika winning was a bad thing

21:10.309 --> 21:12.240
for my game
because I did want her out.

21:12.344 --> 21:14.654
-Heather, do you want
to go pick some limes? Okay.
-Yeah.

21:14.758 --> 21:17.034
SHAN:
So maybe this is an opportunity
to get Heather out

21:17.136 --> 21:19.758
because Heather is an ally
to Erika.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.758
Well, I know Ricard and I
are a solid two,

21:22.862 --> 21:25.034
and we've been working with you.
I mean,

21:25.136 --> 21:27.000
it's three votes on Heather.

21:27.103 --> 21:28.758
-Okay.
-And if we need to,

21:28.862 --> 21:30.413
I have an extra vote
I can put on her.

21:30.517 --> 21:34.000
Okay, and I don't want you
to waste your idol.

21:34.103 --> 21:35.344
I don't want you
to waste yours, either.

21:35.448 --> 21:36.758
That's what I'm saying.
Stick together.

21:38.413 --> 21:41.275
NASEER:
I feel amazing.
Heather will be going home.

21:41.378 --> 21:42.931
Plus, I have

21:43.034 --> 21:44.689
an hidden immunity idol.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.689
I have everything
that I want for tonight.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.586
I'm like cool like cucumber

21:48.689 --> 21:51.448
no matter
what situation is happening.

21:51.550 --> 21:55.000
-Mom, I'm sorry.
-HEATHER: What?

21:56.826 --> 21:57.964
Wow.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.586
These two are my closest ally.

22:00.689 --> 22:03.586
ERIKA:
There must be, like,
something else we can do.

22:06.378 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, but you just have
one idol?

22:08.103 --> 22:10.723
-Yeah.
-Would you play that
for Heather?

22:12.689 --> 22:14.654
Yeah. No way.

22:14.758 --> 22:16.172
-No?
-So I have to take care

22:16.275 --> 22:18.034
-of myself, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

22:22.205 --> 22:24.448
-Got it.
-ERIKA: Naseer seems confident

22:24.550 --> 22:27.309
it's going to be an easy vote,
and Heather's going home.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.344
It is a bit of a heartbreaker
for me because

22:29.448 --> 22:31.517
it's no secret to anyone
that Heather and I are close.

22:31.619 --> 22:33.517
I really am saying,
do what you need to do.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.378
-There will be no hard feelings.
-Yeah.

22:35.481 --> 22:37.586
-I'm ready to talk about that.
-I'm-I'm not voting for you.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.136
Okay. I understand.
[stammers] I get it.

22:40.136 --> 22:41.964
-Who? Naseer?
-Naseer. Yeah.

22:42.067 --> 22:45.103
So I would love
to get rid of Naseer,

22:45.205 --> 22:46.895
or I was hoping that, like,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.758
maybe there's the chance
to vote out Shan.

22:49.862 --> 22:51.103
The problem is, there's

22:51.205 --> 22:53.448
so much power concentrated
with the people

22:53.550 --> 22:55.275
who are here,
knowing that Naseer has an idol,

22:55.378 --> 22:57.378
Shan has so many advantages.

22:57.481 --> 22:59.205
It seems like
there's not a lot of options.

22:59.309 --> 23:01.723
I really did want
to split up Shan and Liana,

23:01.826 --> 23:03.172
but I'm hoping,
on the other side,

23:03.275 --> 23:05.240
-they take out Liana.
-I hope they do.

23:08.103 --> 23:11.067
-We were talking things out.
-Yeah?

23:13.172 --> 23:14.931
I just feel like
you guys have been...

23:17.034 --> 23:18.964
...with Shan and Ricard
and Liana.

23:22.136 --> 23:23.481
I don't even feel
like I'm in it,

23:23.586 --> 23:24.862
and I don't want to be in it,

23:24.964 --> 23:26.517
because I want to play
my own endgame.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.413
DESHAWN:
Whoa. Are you serious?

23:33.517 --> 23:35.758
Xander's telling me Liana

23:35.862 --> 23:37.103
tried to flip the vote on me,

23:37.205 --> 23:38.586
but I don't know
if that's the truth.

23:38.689 --> 23:41.172
But at the end of the day,
I'm gonna be at the top,

23:41.275 --> 23:42.481
and that's not even me
trying to be funny.

23:42.586 --> 23:43.895
It's just me being real.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.689
Like, I've put myself
perfectly in the middle.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.000
If there's a move
that you guys

23:47.103 --> 23:48.586
want to make
that I could help you with,

23:48.689 --> 23:50.000
I'm down to do that.

23:50.103 --> 23:52.136
XANDER:
I'm willing to say
right here now...

23:53.654 --> 23:54.895
Let's do it. Done?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.723
-Yeah, let's make it tomorrow.
-Do it, please.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.103
Evvie and I had made a deal

23:58.205 --> 24:00.517
before we even knew that we were
splitting into this five,

24:00.619 --> 24:02.550
and we said we were going
to protect each other.

24:03.550 --> 24:05.550
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.550
DESHAWN:
But if I take out Liana,

24:07.654 --> 24:10.619
there are gonna be repercussions
from the power alliance,

24:10.723 --> 24:12.448
and then that could put me
in a compromising position.

24:12.550 --> 24:14.103
'Cause right now they think
we're still together.

24:18.344 --> 24:20.240
DESHAWN:
This is where
the rubber hits the road.

24:20.344 --> 24:22.689
I want to play my game
ofSurvivor,

24:22.792 --> 24:24.205
and as long as Xander
doesn't play his idol,

24:24.309 --> 24:27.481
I'm the one deciding
who goes home tonight.

24:27.586 --> 24:29.275
I'm ready to work with you, and
if you say you want to do it,

24:29.378 --> 24:30.619
-Yeah.
-...then I'm with you.

24:30.723 --> 24:32.240
-Yeah.
-I just want
to give you my thoughts.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.931
-Oh, Evvie? Tonight?
-Yes. Yes.

24:40.034 --> 24:43.481
When-when else will we have
the opportunity to get her out?

24:43.586 --> 24:46.275
XANDER:
I was really convinced that
Danny and Deshawn were ready

24:46.378 --> 24:49.723
to work with me, but Danny seems
kind of wishy-washy,

24:49.826 --> 24:51.309
telling me

24:51.413 --> 24:53.034
Evvie would be a better move.

24:53.136 --> 24:55.275
Just think about it. I'm willing
to do whatever you want to do.

24:55.378 --> 24:57.000
XANDER:
And that scares me because

24:57.103 --> 24:58.826
they could work together to try

24:58.931 --> 25:00.344
and blindside her
and pull some big move.

25:00.448 --> 25:02.619
And I'm gonna have
to try and stop that.

25:02.723 --> 25:05.826
So, maybe I should play
my idol for Evvie

25:05.931 --> 25:09.275
because this Tribal is crucial
for the rest of my game.

25:14.136 --> 25:15.448
SHAN: What do you think
is gonna happen

25:15.550 --> 25:16.792
on the other side tonight?

25:16.895 --> 25:18.895
We never know in this game
'cause Xander--

25:19.000 --> 25:20.964
he has the idol.
He may play to Evvie.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.517
-Yeah, we never know
-RICARD: We'll just see.

25:22.619 --> 25:24.586
It doesn't even affect
our plan.

25:25.619 --> 25:27.517
-SHAN: Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:27.619 --> 25:29.103
Everyone has this huge target
for Heather,

25:29.205 --> 25:31.378
and I'm baffled by it.
She has no advantages.

25:31.481 --> 25:33.000
She has no idol,

25:33.103 --> 25:36.103
and yet everyone's focusing
their attention on her.

25:36.205 --> 25:38.550
And so, I have to focus
on an actual threat.

25:38.654 --> 25:40.448
-They are going to vote you.
-Mm-hmm.

25:40.550 --> 25:42.136
But they both have idols.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.136
-Yeah. Yup.
-Okay, that's scary, but

25:44.240 --> 25:46.378
I think
Naseer is the bigger threat,

25:46.481 --> 25:49.550
and I need to make Naseer feel
so comfortable

25:49.654 --> 25:51.309
-that he doesn't play his idol
tonight.
-Yes.

25:51.413 --> 25:53.034
And I think
that really is a possibility.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.413
-It needs to be that it's me
to make him feel good.
-Yeah. Yeah.

25:55.517 --> 25:56.619
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I'm sorry.
-No, I'm... I agree.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.000
RICARD:
If we make him feel really safe,

25:59.103 --> 26:00.550
-he's gone.
-Mm-hmm.

26:00.654 --> 26:03.136
HEATHER:
Oh, my God! This is epic.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.309
Going into Tribal tonight, I
got to try to do the poker face

26:06.413 --> 26:09.654
and just convince Naseer I'm sad
that I'm going home because

26:09.758 --> 26:12.586
if Naseer plays his idol,
the votes are left on me.

26:12.689 --> 26:15.000
If I need to get voted out,
I'm okay.

26:15.103 --> 26:16.378
Like, I know
I'm at the very, very bottom.

26:16.481 --> 26:18.654
Yeah.

26:18.758 --> 26:20.723
HEATHER:
Ricard has come up
with this great plan,

26:20.826 --> 26:23.895
and I'm hopeful everybody will
do their part to make it happen.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.964
Those two are going
to be voting Naseer,

26:26.067 --> 26:28.654
and we use the extra vote
on Naseer, but...

26:28.758 --> 26:29.895
-Yeah, it's two-three.
-...we need to make sure

26:30.000 --> 26:31.136
there's a Heather vote
out there.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.723
And we need to make sure
there's enough of them

26:32.826 --> 26:34.344
in case they do
try anything sneaky.

26:34.448 --> 26:35.619
So then
we're all gonna vote who?

26:35.723 --> 26:37.723
Naseer, and then he's gone.

26:37.826 --> 26:39.344
Then we're fine.

26:39.448 --> 26:41.309
I want to vote
Heather's ass out.

26:41.413 --> 26:43.103
No! Heather makes no sense,
Shan.

26:43.205 --> 26:44.586
Absolutely none.
She has nothing.

26:44.689 --> 26:46.586
She has no alliance
except Erika.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.000
She has no advantages.
Naseer has an idol.

26:49.103 --> 26:52.413
-Because I don't trust
Heather and Erika.
-I don't care.

26:52.517 --> 26:53.862
That doesn't make sense.

26:53.964 --> 26:56.172
But can I have the extra vote
to do this?

26:56.275 --> 26:58.067
Well, I'll cast the extra vote.

26:58.172 --> 26:59.309
Will you?

26:59.413 --> 27:01.964
I will cast the extra vote...

27:02.067 --> 27:03.964
To take out Naseer?

27:04.067 --> 27:06.344
I don't know. I-I just
don't know if I can trust Erika.

27:06.448 --> 27:09.344
This is very, very risky because

27:09.448 --> 27:10.964
I don't trust Erika and Heather.

27:11.067 --> 27:12.792
I just get
the hibbity jibbities.

27:12.895 --> 27:14.481
Like, I just don't get
the best vibe.

27:14.586 --> 27:15.862
I just don't...
I just want to make sure

27:15.964 --> 27:17.619
it's not gonna
turn on me or Ricard.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.344
Well, it might, but...

27:21.344 --> 27:23.240
SHAN: I feel like
Naseer is another number for me.

27:23.344 --> 27:24.964
And so,
the easy move would be

27:25.067 --> 27:26.862
to just cast all the votes
on Heather

27:26.964 --> 27:28.931
and even maybe save
the extra vote

27:29.034 --> 27:30.586
for a little bit further
down the road.

27:30.689 --> 27:32.619
That is you making a decision.

27:32.723 --> 27:34.413
That's not how
this game is supposed to go.

27:34.517 --> 27:35.931
It's not what one person wants.
It... it is...

27:36.034 --> 27:37.240
Uh, uh,
I don't know if that's...

27:37.344 --> 27:38.826
I don't know
if I completely agree with that.

27:38.931 --> 27:41.826
I feel like everybody's
doing that in their own way.

27:41.931 --> 27:45.172
RICARD:
It's complicated with Shan.
I know she has my back.

27:45.275 --> 27:46.448
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

27:46.550 --> 27:47.792
she's gonna follow through
with the plan

27:47.895 --> 27:49.931
because it has to be her way

27:50.034 --> 27:51.517
all the time.

27:51.619 --> 27:54.034
And it does not make sense
to get Heather out tonight.

27:56.964 --> 27:59.586
If not, I will literally
kill you guys.

27:59.689 --> 28:02.550
RICARD:
Naseer, to me,
is the biggest threat, but

28:02.654 --> 28:04.309
I have the most high-maintenance
alliance ever.

28:04.413 --> 28:07.792
If Shan is not willing
to budge on her stance,

28:07.895 --> 28:11.000
then Heather could be bye-bye.

28:23.826 --> 28:25.931
â™ª

28:48.826 --> 28:52.309
PROBST:
All right, so, Ricard,
after the challenge,

28:52.413 --> 28:53.862
you guys were sent back to Ua.

28:53.964 --> 28:56.448
-Which sucks.
-[laughter]
-It's just awful.

28:56.550 --> 28:58.862
-It's just awful.
-PROBST: Do you even care

28:58.964 --> 29:00.862
that you're there?
Does it just become about,

29:00.964 --> 29:03.481
"What are we gonna do?
There's only five people,

29:03.586 --> 29:05.344
-and Erika's safe"?
-RICARD: I mean,

29:05.448 --> 29:07.378
Shan and myself have clearly
been together

29:07.481 --> 29:10.000
since the very beginning,
and we've been very close

29:10.103 --> 29:11.550
with Naseer,
and Erika is clearly safe.

29:11.654 --> 29:15.067
And so, there seems
to be a more clear-cut choice.

29:15.172 --> 29:18.931
PROBST:
Heather, does this ring true
that

29:19.034 --> 29:20.517
you could be
a very easy vote tonight?

29:20.619 --> 29:22.654
I amthe easy vote tonight.

29:22.758 --> 29:25.240
You know, I'm still hopeful
there's going to be a miracle,

29:25.344 --> 29:27.448
and some idol is going
to just fall out of the sky.

29:27.550 --> 29:30.067
Cue the idol.

29:32.172 --> 29:33.240
Oh, my God.

29:33.344 --> 29:35.000
Oh.

29:35.103 --> 29:36.275
[laughs]

29:37.689 --> 29:40.481
-Didn't work, did it?
-PROBST: What's the move?

29:40.586 --> 29:41.792
If you feel
you're on the bottom,

29:41.895 --> 29:44.931
do you just hold,
or do you try to make a move?

29:45.034 --> 29:46.654
I-I... I don't have a-a person

29:46.758 --> 29:48.103
that I could point to
at this point

29:48.205 --> 29:50.619
because I don't have the goodies
to keep me safe.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.309
I don't have the idol,
I don't have the extra vote.

29:52.413 --> 29:55.136
-It's just me right now.
-ERIKA: I mean, it's not like

29:55.240 --> 29:56.654
we laid down our swords.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.034
Like, Heather and I are a pair.
We pitched to everyone.

29:59.136 --> 30:01.240
"Like, we're two votes,
if you want to do something."

30:01.344 --> 30:02.413
But the problem is,

30:02.517 --> 30:04.481
everyone knows
where the advantages are.

30:04.586 --> 30:06.136
And the advantages are not
with Heather and I.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.172
So I think if you're not someone
with an advantage,

30:08.275 --> 30:11.378
it actually creates, like,
all these obstacles for you.

30:11.481 --> 30:15.448
Why does everybody know
what everybody has?

30:15.550 --> 30:17.964
We know we had to activate--
it was a three-way activate.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.067
NASEER:
Activate a three-way
shared idol, so,

30:20.172 --> 30:22.067
I do have
an hidden immunity idol.

30:22.172 --> 30:24.758
And we've worked hard
to get that power.

30:24.862 --> 30:28.067
I don't want to give up
that power to save someone else

30:28.172 --> 30:30.586
'cause maybe I may need
to use for myself.

30:30.689 --> 30:33.689
PROBST:
Shan, often when people know
you have an idol,

30:33.792 --> 30:35.275
you're worried
they're going to come for you

30:35.378 --> 30:36.550
because they want you
to play it.

30:36.654 --> 30:37.689
-Yeah.
-But it sounds like

30:37.792 --> 30:39.034
this group has a different

30:39.136 --> 30:40.826
maybe approach this season.

30:40.931 --> 30:43.654
I-I mean, it-it seems
like there's an obvious

30:43.758 --> 30:45.413
decision to make tonight,

30:45.517 --> 30:47.275
because
Naseer, myself and Ricard

30:47.378 --> 30:48.586
have been voting together.

30:48.689 --> 30:50.378
But at the same time,

30:50.481 --> 30:51.826
I feel just as much at risk.

30:51.931 --> 30:54.862
You know, the only person
that's safe tonight is Erika.

30:54.964 --> 30:57.931
Ricard, any time
there's a small group like this,

30:58.034 --> 30:59.413
it is dangerous.

30:59.517 --> 31:02.240
But every time
there's a dangerous situation,

31:02.344 --> 31:04.550
for someone
there's opportunity.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.481
What's complicated
with this particular season--

31:07.586 --> 31:09.309
it's not very easy to say,

31:09.413 --> 31:11.758
"Oh, this person has an idol.
Let's vote them out."

31:11.862 --> 31:13.136
The reality is,

31:13.240 --> 31:16.586
the three of us have
three advantages in this game.

31:16.689 --> 31:19.240
And you're gonna make the same
argument to all of us saying,

31:19.344 --> 31:21.000
"Oh, I can't say,
vote this person out

31:21.103 --> 31:22.723
"'cause they have an idol
'cause you have an idol.

31:22.826 --> 31:25.034
And I can't say that to you
'cause you have an advantage."

31:25.136 --> 31:27.344
It's just a hard day, hard day.

31:27.448 --> 31:29.689
It's a hard day for everybody.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.000
Why is it hard for you, Naseer?

31:31.103 --> 31:32.723
'Cause Heather and I--
we had a relationship.

31:32.826 --> 31:35.275
Like, from the beginning,
it's like on a roller coaster.

31:35.378 --> 31:37.413
But I approached her
'cause I'm still learning.

31:37.517 --> 31:40.550
There's a lot to learn.
So, she's a great teacher,

31:40.654 --> 31:42.895
and I really respect her
like mother.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.205
But that person is about
to leave.

31:46.309 --> 31:47.964
That is hard.

31:48.067 --> 31:50.619
[groans]

31:50.723 --> 31:52.964
It's okay.

31:53.067 --> 31:54.481
PROBST:
What just came on?

31:54.586 --> 31:56.862
What emotion just hit?

31:56.964 --> 32:01.000
I'm here because I wanted
to do this for 20 years.

32:01.103 --> 32:02.344
Right from the beginning,

32:02.448 --> 32:04.000
I was going to start
at the bottom,

32:04.103 --> 32:06.586
you know, because I'm older
and these disadvantages.

32:06.689 --> 32:09.275
And I came out here, and

32:09.378 --> 32:11.964
every day has gotten better,
and I've learned something else

32:12.067 --> 32:14.413
about myself
and about other people.

32:14.517 --> 32:15.826
And I'm proud
that I've made it this far.

32:15.931 --> 32:17.723
Can't wait for my kids
to see this.

32:23.586 --> 32:25.826
I really am proud of myself.

32:26.792 --> 32:29.862
PROBST:
On that note,
it is time to vote.

32:29.964 --> 32:32.000
Ricard, you're up.

32:32.103 --> 32:34.067
â™ª

32:51.517 --> 32:53.344
Sorry, Mama.

33:10.344 --> 33:12.619
I'll go tally the votes.

33:23.413 --> 33:25.067
All right,
if anybody has an advantage

33:25.172 --> 33:26.309
or hidden immunity idol,

33:26.413 --> 33:27.481
and you want to play it,

33:27.586 --> 33:29.964
now would be the time to do so.

33:33.103 --> 33:35.413
Okay, I'll read the votes.

33:37.103 --> 33:39.550
First vote--

33:39.654 --> 33:41.067
Heather.

33:43.619 --> 33:46.654
Naseer. One vote-- Heather,
one vote-- Naseer.

33:47.586 --> 33:51.240
Heather. Two votes-- Heather,
one vote-- Naseer.

33:51.344 --> 33:52.895
â™ª

33:53.000 --> 33:55.619
Heather. Three votes-- Heather,
one vote-- Naseer.

33:59.931 --> 34:02.723
Naseer.
That's two votes-- Naseer,

34:02.826 --> 34:05.240
three votes-- Heather,
one vote left.

34:13.103 --> 34:15.619
Naseer. We're tied.

34:15.724 --> 34:18.550
Three votes-- Heather,
three votes-- Naseer.

34:19.550 --> 34:22.827
â™ª

34:27.862 --> 34:31.000
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna revote.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.068
You can only vote
for Heather or Naseer.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.413
Heather and Naseer, you can only
vote for each other,

34:36.516 --> 34:38.862
so you won't vote.
Ricard, you're up.

34:38.965 --> 34:40.896
Will you come grab this?

34:46.206 --> 34:48.240
â™ª

35:10.068 --> 35:12.000
I'll go tally the votes.

35:12.103 --> 35:13.827
â™ª

35:22.931 --> 35:25.619
â™ª

35:30.309 --> 35:32.034
I'll read the votes.

35:32.137 --> 35:33.481
â™ª

35:36.585 --> 35:38.413
First vote-- Naseer.

35:38.516 --> 35:41.827
â™ª

35:43.000 --> 35:45.619
Naseer.

35:45.724 --> 35:48.172
-â™ª
-Ninth person voted out,

35:48.275 --> 35:50.275
and the second member
of our jury--

35:50.378 --> 35:52.550
Naseer. Naseer, you need
to bring your torch.

35:52.655 --> 35:53.965
Good playing with you guys.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.896
-Good playing with you, too.
-Thank you.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.896
-Thank you.
-Thank you for everything,
Naseer.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.240
â™ª

36:03.344 --> 36:05.481
Naseer, the tribe has spoken.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.724
You can take your spot
on the jury next to Tiffany.

36:08.827 --> 36:11.206
-Good job, guys. Bye.
-Good job, Naseer.

36:11.309 --> 36:12.516
Thank you.

36:13.550 --> 36:16.000
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

36:16.103 --> 36:18.413
We'll bring in the next group.

36:18.516 --> 36:19.931
â™ª

36:20.034 --> 36:21.965
Bye, guys.

36:23.965 --> 36:27.103
Unfortunately, I was blindsided.

36:27.206 --> 36:28.965
But did I enjoy
every single moment here?

36:29.068 --> 36:30.619
Absolutely, 100%.

36:30.724 --> 36:33.172
It was my dream
to be onSurvivor

36:33.275 --> 36:35.206
and to enjoySurvivor.

36:35.309 --> 36:38.137
And I did it
every single moment I'm here.

36:45.378 --> 36:47.240
â™ª

36:47.344 --> 36:49.619
PROBST:
Getting your first look

36:49.724 --> 36:52.000
at what just happened--

36:52.103 --> 36:53.793
Naseer voted out.

36:53.896 --> 36:55.000
Wow.

36:55.103 --> 36:56.757
-That's crazy.
-PROBST: Danny,

36:56.862 --> 36:59.965
that's how real the game is,
how fast you can be out.

37:00.068 --> 37:02.931
He was sitting in one of these
seats just a few minutes ago.

37:03.034 --> 37:05.000
DANNY:
It's-it's very nerve-racking.

37:05.103 --> 37:06.344
I think we all would have bet

37:06.447 --> 37:07.655
that Naseer would have
played his idol

37:07.757 --> 37:09.137
tonight and been safe,

37:09.240 --> 37:11.000
but a lot of us don't
have protection here.

37:11.103 --> 37:14.447
Xander's the only person
who's for sure not going home.

37:14.550 --> 37:16.550
PROBST:
So, Xander, not only do you win

37:16.655 --> 37:17.862
immunity for yourself,

37:17.965 --> 37:20.481
but you win
chicken and beef stew.

37:20.585 --> 37:23.655
-By the way, Jeff, you undersold
the hell out of it.
-Yeah. Oh, my God.

37:23.757 --> 37:25.206
XANDER:
It was so good.

37:25.309 --> 37:29.481
Hearty potatoes, warm broth

37:29.585 --> 37:31.827
and carrots and onions,
and that was

37:31.931 --> 37:34.619
-exactly what we got.
-PROBST: So, Deshawn,

37:34.724 --> 37:36.309
you get back,
you have this nice reward,

37:36.413 --> 37:38.309
which is great
because it's fuel.

37:38.413 --> 37:40.724
But the bigger question is,
now what?

37:40.827 --> 37:43.688
DESHAWN:
Yeah, I mean,
it's unfortunate because

37:43.793 --> 37:46.516
there are four people here
who I wanted

37:46.619 --> 37:48.137
to really work with
and who I feel

37:48.240 --> 37:50.000
like I've developed
decent relationships with,

37:50.103 --> 37:51.793
but there's nowhere to hide
in this Tribal Council.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.447
Somebody has to go home,

37:53.550 --> 37:55.309
and unfortunately
it's going to be somebody

37:55.413 --> 37:58.206
who I actually wanted
to work with in this game, so...

37:58.309 --> 37:59.896
PROBST:
So, Liana, you guys have had
some crazy

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Tribals so far,
but this is different

38:02.103 --> 38:05.000
'cause it's a small group.
Do you feel that?

38:05.103 --> 38:06.965
Absolutely. I think, you know,
there's four of us

38:07.068 --> 38:09.931
here on the chopping block.
25% chance of going home.

38:10.034 --> 38:12.413
So, you know,
it becomes even more real.

38:12.516 --> 38:14.793
Like, the game is as dangerous
as it's ever been.

38:14.896 --> 38:17.724
And it's very real,
and my heart is beating so fast

38:17.827 --> 38:20.068
in my chest right now
because of how real it is.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.516
Xander, did you have
more power today

38:22.619 --> 38:25.757
because you were safe, and
there's an odd number in five?

38:25.862 --> 38:29.000
I mean, yeah. Certainly, people
are going to be kissing up

38:29.103 --> 38:31.034
to the person
who does have the power.

38:31.137 --> 38:35.068
And it's important to pay
attention to which people are

38:35.172 --> 38:37.896
actually genuine and who I want
to go forward with.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.309
PROBST:
Evvie, everybody's cagey.

38:41.413 --> 38:43.103
-Nobody's really said anything.
-Right.

38:43.206 --> 38:45.862
That seems true. [laughs]

38:45.965 --> 38:49.378
I mean, I'm sure
there's a number of plans, but

38:49.481 --> 38:51.068
I'm, like, 75% sure

38:51.172 --> 38:52.827
that what I think is
gonna happen will happen.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.724
Let's do that.
Let's just go around the horn.

38:55.827 --> 38:57.550
Liana, how comfortable are you

38:57.655 --> 38:59.688
that your plan is the one
that will happen tonight?

38:59.793 --> 39:02.000
Pretty comfortable.

39:02.103 --> 39:03.206
PROBST:
How about you, Deshawn?

39:03.309 --> 39:05.413
I'm pretty comfortable.

39:05.516 --> 39:07.688
-How about you, Xander?
-I'd say pretty comfortable.

39:07.793 --> 39:09.447
PROBST:
How about you, Danny?

39:09.550 --> 39:10.965
Before I walked up here
to Tribal,

39:11.068 --> 39:12.550
I was pretty comfortable.

39:12.655 --> 39:14.068
And then realization hit me once

39:14.172 --> 39:15.413
I saw Naseer sitting up there

39:15.516 --> 39:17.137
that you-you never really know,

39:17.240 --> 39:19.793
and the reminder's sitting
right there in front of us.

39:19.896 --> 39:23.516
Deshawn, everybody here must be
playing a very good game

39:23.619 --> 39:26.000
because everybody's
pretty sure they're right.

39:26.103 --> 39:27.275
If all of us here are saying

39:27.378 --> 39:28.757
that we're pretty comfortable,
somebody lied

39:28.862 --> 39:30.585
to somebody, so I think
we're gonna find out,

39:30.688 --> 39:32.413
like, who's who in the zoo
when it comes

39:32.516 --> 39:35.172
to who's telling the truth
and who's not, so we'll see.

39:35.275 --> 39:38.516
PROBST:
Evvie, does that excite you
that you're playing

39:38.619 --> 39:41.619
-with people
that are this good at it?
-EVVIE: Absolutely.

39:41.724 --> 39:43.965
I mean, it's like you're
at the top of a roller coaster

39:44.068 --> 39:46.000
and you, like, feel like
you're gonna die.

39:46.103 --> 39:48.275
But, like, the fun part is
when at the end, you don't die.

39:48.378 --> 39:50.000
I... you know, I've gotten
to the point where I, like,

39:50.103 --> 39:51.965
looked Survivordeath
in the face

39:52.068 --> 39:54.413
and lived,
and it's freaking exhilarating.

39:54.516 --> 39:56.068
You know?
But, uh, I really think

39:56.172 --> 39:58.655
that the thing that I think's
gonna happen will happen.

39:58.757 --> 40:00.447
-So, I just hope it happens.
-PROBST: So, Deshawn,

40:00.550 --> 40:02.447
using Evvie's analogy,

40:02.550 --> 40:04.103
we're up here
on the roller coaster then?

40:04.206 --> 40:05.619
DESHAWN:
Absolutely.
We're all in this car,

40:05.724 --> 40:08.965
this roller coaster car
together, and unfortunately,

40:09.068 --> 40:11.585
in this scenario,
somebody's going to die.

40:12.724 --> 40:14.757
On that note, it's time to vote.

40:14.862 --> 40:17.516
Liana, you're up.

40:17.619 --> 40:20.585
â™ª

40:30.034 --> 40:32.206
â™ª

40:44.516 --> 40:46.068
I'll go tally the votes.

40:53.378 --> 40:55.896
If anybody has an advantage
or hidden immunity idol

40:56.000 --> 40:58.688
and you want to play it,
now would be the time to do so.

41:08.688 --> 41:10.309
PROBST:
Okay, I'll read the votes.

41:13.275 --> 41:15.619
First vote--

41:15.724 --> 41:18.172
Liana.

41:18.275 --> 41:20.896
Evvie.

41:24.931 --> 41:27.965
Liana. That's two votes-- Liana.

41:28.068 --> 41:30.481
â™ª

41:30.585 --> 41:33.000
Evvie. We're tied.
Two votes-- Liana,

41:33.103 --> 41:35.137
two votes-- Evvie,
one vote left.

41:37.619 --> 41:41.000
Tenth person voted out, and
the third member of our jury...

41:41.103 --> 41:42.793
-Damn.
-Evvie.

41:42.896 --> 41:44.793
Damn.

41:44.896 --> 41:47.550
All right. Good game, guys.

41:48.827 --> 41:53.034
â™ª

41:57.516 --> 42:00.931
Evvie, the tribe has spoken.

42:03.275 --> 42:04.172
-Time for you to go.
-Bye.

42:04.275 --> 42:05.172
-Well played, guys.
-Bye.

42:05.275 --> 42:07.137
Take care.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.655
Damn.

42:09.757 --> 42:12.516
Good one, guys.

42:12.619 --> 42:14.827
Grab your torches,
head back to camp.

42:14.931 --> 42:16.275
Good night.

DESHAWN: As long as Ricard is
in the game, Shan is

42:42.240 --> 42:43.275
the most powerful player.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.378
RICARD:
Deshawn continues to lie.

42:50.481 --> 42:52.068
It bothers me.
It annoys me.

42:52.172 --> 42:54.309
SHAN:
Seeing Deshawn talk with Erika--

42:54.413 --> 42:55.516
he's really sneaky.

43:02.827 --> 43:04.000
Well, you know, they got me.
That's Survivor.

43:04.103 --> 43:05.550
I honestly am not exactly sure

43:05.655 --> 43:08.000
who flipped on me, but I was
living on borrowed time anyway.

43:08.103 --> 43:09.896
You know, I did my best.
I'm incredibly proud of myself.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.068
Like, I had an absolute blast.
I can't complain.

43:13.172 --> 43:14.481
Survivor's the best game ever,

43:14.585 --> 43:16.172
and I'm-I'm so happy
I was a part of it.

43:16.275 --> 43:18.000
Any queer kids out there--
be yourself.

43:18.103 --> 43:20.275
You're amazing.
Love yourself.
