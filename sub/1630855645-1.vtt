01:17.162 --> 01:23.165
AFTER YEARS OF PEACE, THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE IS 
ON THE BIRDS OF A NEW RELIGIOUS WAR.

01:23.166 --> 01:27.875
KING LOUIS XIII, STILL WITHOUT HEIR, 
RULES A DIVIDED COUNTRY.

01:27.876 --> 01:31.583
ON THE ONE SIDE, THE PROTESTANT FORCES 
SUPPORTED BY ENGLAND.

01:31.584 --> 01:36.083
ON THE OTHER, THE CATHOLIC NOBILITY, 
WHICH SEEKS TO EXPAND ITS DOMAIN.

01:37.501 --> 01:41.718
THE KING HAS HIS 
MOST POWERFUL MINISTER, CARDINAL DE RICHELIEU,

01:41.719 --> 01:44.044
TO RESTORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN.

01:44.045 --> 01:48.200
BUT MANY MISS THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL 
AND HIS LUST FOR POWER.

01:48.201 --> 01:50.574
IN THIS CLIMATE OF CONSPIRACIES AND REVOLTS,

01:50.575 --> 01:53.284
D'ARTAGNAN, A YOUNG GASCON, 
GOES TO PARIS

01:53.285 --> 01:56.507
IN HOPE OF BECOMING 
A KING'S MUSHEETER.

03:30.406 --> 03:31.606
Get out of here!

05:24.012 --> 05:25.593
Bury everything.

05:29.306 --> 05:30.666
Take care of her.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.506
Miss Bonacieux?

07:36.167 --> 07:39.372
The Countess of Valcour expects 
an answer later today.

07:39.373 --> 07:41.670
The ship leaves tomorrow at dawn.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.128
All good.

08:22.688 --> 08:25.458
<i>"On this Saturday, 
as on all Holy Saturdays,</i>

08:25.459 --> 08:26.912
you will go alone...

08:27.599 --> 08:31.167
go to confession in the abbey of Val de Grâce.

08:31.814 --> 08:33.631
<i>I will be there, in secret,</i>

08:33.631 --> 08:36.395
and I will confess that I only think of you.

08:36.698 --> 08:39.998
Within six days, unless I die,

08:40.799 --> 08:43.000
I'll see you again, my lady.

08:43.001 --> 08:46.812
<i>Your beloved servant, the Duke of Buckingham."</i>

08:58.896 --> 09:02.706
He insists on coming to a city 
where he is risking his life.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.512
And you're risking 
my honor by doing this.

09:19.703 --> 09:21.901
Her Majesty the Queen!

09:42.103 --> 09:45.379
With the approval of His Holiness the Pope,

09:45.380 --> 09:48.497
Arthus d'Épinay de Saint Luc, 
Bispo de Marselha,

09:48.498 --> 09:51.833
will be placed at the right hand of His Majesty.

09:54.902 --> 09:58.006
Brother François de Loménie, 
of the Dominican order...

09:58.007 --> 09:59.312
How are you, brother?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.298
Your marriage to the Duchess of Montpensier 
doesn't interest you?

10:04.299 --> 10:07.202
We have prepared a wedding 
and we must prepare for war.

10:07.901 --> 10:08.910
Guerra?

10:11.500 --> 10:12.873
Against who?

10:12.874 --> 10:14.000
The Protestants.

10:14.401 --> 10:19.456
Sir, La Rochelle has been gathering 
men and weapons for weeks.

10:19.457 --> 10:21.046
Prepare for secession.

10:21.998 --> 10:25.789
If we don't act, 
it will be a state within a state.

10:25.790 --> 10:28.102
England with one foot in France!

10:28.998 --> 10:31.201
Do you wish, Count,

10:32.295 --> 10:35.306
declare war on protesters

10:36.596 --> 10:37.884
and England?

10:37.885 --> 10:39.999
Protestants serve the English.

10:40.302 --> 10:42.814
Saint-Blancard, their leader, 
is in London.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.208
Buckingham personally received him.

10:48.184 --> 10:52.604
Why would the English War Minister 
receive the Protestants of La Rochelle,

10:52.605 --> 10:54.593
if not to prepare for war?

10:54.594 --> 10:57.542
We must rid the country of these heretics!

10:58.606 --> 11:01.107
So it's not a war 
you're looking for,

11:01.108 --> 11:02.697
but a crusade.

11:02.698 --> 11:04.706
One God, one nation, one religion.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.810
Pare!

11:08.609 --> 11:12.014
I will not order 
another massacre of Saint-Barthélemy.

11:19.006 --> 11:23.406
The bells of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois 
will ring this time for your wedding,

11:24.759 --> 11:26.697
not by a massacre of Protestants.

11:27.470 --> 11:30.399
Need I remind you that our father 
was killed by Catholics?

11:31.990 --> 11:34.404
Beware of your devout friends.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.167
- Your Majesty implies... 
- I don't mean anything.

11:39.583 --> 11:40.878
I am the king.

11:45.706 --> 11:49.806
The nobility only wants to fight for the lord.

11:50.958 --> 11:54.209
- We are your true friends. 
- The King has no friends.

11:56.456 --> 11:58.906
Just minions and enemies.

12:00.593 --> 12:03.417
It's time to show that we are your servants.

12:06.297 --> 12:07.310
It's not like this?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.618
He believes himself to be Louis the Just.

12:24.292 --> 12:26.004
It's just Louis the Weak.

12:26.005 --> 12:29.648
My son... 
Thinks he's talking to his brother.

12:30.204 --> 12:31.798
But you are talking to your king.

12:32.393 --> 12:33.814
Were you here, mother?

12:34.284 --> 12:36.458
I did not hear you.

12:36.459 --> 12:38.806
You already know how to speak loud and clear.

12:39.196 --> 12:41.209
Learn to be silent.

12:42.203 --> 12:44.103
Maybe that's how I hear you.

12:56.302 --> 12:58.707
- Your Eminence. 
- Madam.

12:59.895 --> 13:00.895
Then?

13:02.300 --> 13:07.406
Thanks to you, Buckingham and the Queen 
will finally be able to meet.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.610
Some problem?

13:11.488 --> 13:13.297
Dead and buried.

13:15.298 --> 13:17.792
The queen prefers dishonor to war.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.801
She will be dishonored.

13:22.406 --> 13:24.112
And we, the war.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.591
Excuse me. 
I would like to see Captain de Tréville.

14:07.592 --> 14:10.164
- Do you have an audience? 
- No, just a recommendation.

14:10.165 --> 14:12.502
- It's that line over there. 
- Thanks.

14:17.301 --> 14:19.407
- There are two days of waiting. 
- No, three.

14:19.408 --> 14:22.196
The gentleman in green arrived 
Sunday from Carcassonne.

14:22.197 --> 14:23.291
Good luck.

14:23.292 --> 14:24.699
No, it's of no use to you.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.912
Pega!

15:17.495 --> 15:18.495
Next.

15:19.006 --> 15:21.333
One meter eighty.

15:21.805 --> 15:23.007
Next.

15:30.628 --> 15:32.003
To point!

15:32.606 --> 15:33.614
Fogo!

15:53.449 --> 15:54.699
Listen!

15:55.026 --> 15:56.609
Yesterday morning,

15:56.610 --> 16:00.805
Richelieu's guard met 
a handful of revelers,

16:00.806 --> 16:04.707
drunk as wretches, 
causing a riot in the street.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.792
And who were these braggarts?

16:08.996 --> 16:11.109
The King's Musketeers!

16:12.292 --> 16:14.454
You should know, they recognized you.

16:14.455 --> 16:15.998
Captain, how could I...

16:15.999 --> 16:20.607
I don't want to be the laughingstock 
of the cardinal's guard.

16:30.996 --> 16:32.998
- Captain de Treville? 
- Young.

16:33.698 --> 16:36.794
My name is Charles D'Artagnan. 
I bring a letter from my father.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.350
- D'Artagnan! Son of Achilles? 
- Yes.

16:39.351 --> 16:42.998
- Where does this letter come from? 
- I suffered a musket attack.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.704
My Bible stopped the bullet.

16:44.705 --> 16:47.506
It will be the first this year 
to be saved by religion.

16:48.406 --> 16:51.206
I knew your father. 
What does his son want?

16:51.207 --> 16:52.804
Be brief, I have little time.

16:52.805 --> 16:56.458
I left Gascony 
to take the habit and serve the king.

16:56.459 --> 16:59.378
I always dreamed of being a musketeer.

16:59.379 --> 17:01.798
I will write 
to the director of the Royal Academy.

17:01.799 --> 17:04.710
I can not do anything else. 
You will join the cadets.

17:05.103 --> 17:07.900
And maybe one day 
you can be a musketeer.

17:08.398 --> 17:10.880
Don't worry, 
you won't have to wait long.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.615
- Pardon me. 
- That is all?

17:52.085 --> 17:53.912
Do you think that will be enough?

17:54.296 --> 17:55.799
I apologized.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.009
I have only one arm 
but two ears.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.666
That "I'm sorry" didn't sound sincere.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.514
Excuse me, but I'm in a hurry.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.670
You are very rude.

18:05.195 --> 18:07.104
When a Gascon apologizes,

18:07.495 --> 18:10.209
he has already done more than half 
of what he needed to do.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.244
Because it shows you've come 
a long way.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.458
Regarding where I come from,

18:15.459 --> 18:17.359
it will not be you who will teach me.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.228
I'll teach you a lesson...

18:19.229 --> 18:21.536
my way and it will be the last.

18:21.537 --> 18:24.907
Know that I will cross your path 
whenever I want.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.700
Where, please?

18:26.701 --> 18:29.710
Calvary Saint-Sulpice at 11 am.

18:29.711 --> 18:30.911
I will be there.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.016
Oh my God!

18:43.666 --> 18:45.066
Don't know how to look when you run?

18:45.866 --> 18:48.451
Sorry, I'm after someone.

18:49.408 --> 18:51.621
If I had more meat, 
I would make a skewer.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.939
Tell us what makes you laugh 
and let's laugh together.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.582
I can laugh whenever I want.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.033
Not about me.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.200
If you don't want to laugh, 
I'll shut your mouth.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.250
Where, please?

19:11.251 --> 19:12.251
In Luxembourg?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.301
Yes, in Luxembourg. Midday.

19:14.302 --> 19:15.752
It will whet my appetite.

19:15.753 --> 19:16.853
I will be there.

19:17.253 --> 19:18.253
Corre!

19:19.816 --> 19:21.605
One shot is enough, see?

19:22.591 --> 19:23.591
Yes.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.583
Flying punches!

20:06.191 --> 20:07.191
Sir.

20:08.066 --> 20:10.138
You'll be sorry 
if you lose this scarf.

20:13.008 --> 20:15.208
You're wrong, it's not mine.

20:16.608 --> 20:18.008
It's my wife's.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.958
Must have dropped it.

20:22.566 --> 20:25.577
I saw it fall at your feet, 
I thought it was yours.

20:25.578 --> 20:27.128
But it can be yours.

20:27.129 --> 20:28.229
Here it is.

20:28.230 --> 20:29.330
I must have been wrong.

20:29.331 --> 20:30.993
I'm scared too.

20:35.316 --> 20:36.916
You got me in trouble.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.667
Sorry. I did not mean that.

20:38.668 --> 20:40.268
Of course.

20:41.666 --> 20:42.966
Do you think I'm scared?

20:43.983 --> 20:47.083
Do not be stupid. 
It would be smart to be afraid.

20:47.708 --> 20:48.808
Yes, I'm a fool.

20:50.625 --> 20:51.825
That's what I thought.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.940
You are wrong if you intend to humiliate me.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.912
Listen, I usually don't fight 
if I don't have to.

20:59.913 --> 21:01.530
And always disgusted.

21:01.531 --> 21:03.080
But this time it's serious.

21:03.081 --> 21:05.281
Because of him, 
a girl was compromised.

21:05.794 --> 21:06.894
By my fault?

21:07.294 --> 21:09.392
If I can't teach you how to live,

21:09.393 --> 21:11.193
I will teach you how to die.

21:13.108 --> 21:14.108
And where, please?

21:15.458 --> 21:16.958
At noon in the Carmelitas.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.683
At your service.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.917
Sorry, can it be at 1pm?

21:26.108 --> 21:29.250
Enjoy this 
extra hour of life that I grant you.

21:29.775 --> 21:30.775
Thanks.

22:10.716 --> 22:14.517
Sorry I confused you. 
I am really sorry.

22:14.518 --> 22:16.101
I almost killed you.

22:16.733 --> 22:18.733
- I'm used to it. 
- My apologies.

22:18.734 --> 22:21.213
There was a man following me.

22:23.233 --> 22:24.233
It was nothing.

22:24.733 --> 22:25.933
Constance.

22:28.025 --> 22:29.725
-Constance Bonacieux. 
- Delighted.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.325
D'Artagnan.

22:32.275 --> 22:34.740
- Are you here for the ad? 
- Yes.

22:34.741 --> 22:35.891
What ad?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.263
The room for rent.

22:38.589 --> 22:39.631
I rent it.

22:41.516 --> 22:42.641
Right.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.206
Don't want to see him first?

22:45.603 --> 22:46.817
But.

22:46.818 --> 22:50.210
No, it's okay, I've seen enough.

22:52.092 --> 22:54.408
I'm afraid the blow 
has affected your vision.

22:56.891 --> 22:59.818
- I hope you're at least listening to me. 
- I am.

23:00.911 --> 23:03.314
A quarter is a pound a week.

23:03.889 --> 23:05.288
A pound a week?

23:05.289 --> 23:06.289
That.

23:06.688 --> 23:09.198
Here I give you four weeks.

23:10.234 --> 23:12.093
Or four boards for my coffin.

23:12.910 --> 23:14.797
Did I hurt you that much?

23:14.798 --> 23:15.964
No, it didn't.

23:16.706 --> 23:19.099
But in an hour I have 
to find three men.

23:19.804 --> 23:21.328
Will they kill you?

23:22.206 --> 23:23.206
Sim.

23:24.788 --> 23:26.329
At least they will be musketeers.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.501
A good place to die.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.905
I thought about it several times.

24:16.918 --> 24:19.021
We haven't introduced ourselves yet.

24:20.703 --> 24:22.619
Athos de Sillègue d'Hauteville,

24:24.797 --> 24:26.178
Conde de la Fere.

24:26.555 --> 24:28.805
Charles D'Artagnan, da Gasconha.

24:32.710 --> 24:35.500
If I kill you, they'll call me 
a child eater.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.213
And who kills old people?

24:38.214 --> 24:39.808
Do I look tired?

24:39.809 --> 24:43.507
Are you injured and still dueling?

24:43.508 --> 24:45.220
If my right hand fails me,

24:46.708 --> 24:48.378
the left will do.

24:52.717 --> 24:55.217
Two of my friends 
will act as sponsors.

24:56.498 --> 24:59.114
What is he doing here? 
Is this your godfather?

24:59.115 --> 25:00.400
He is Ports.

25:00.911 --> 25:02.816
The second is called Aramis.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.796
I will fight with Mr. D'Artagnan.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.704
I must also fight him.

25:07.705 --> 25:08.747
By noon.

25:08.748 --> 25:11.701
And I'll kill you at 1pm.

25:15.511 --> 25:20.532
Listen, Mr. Athos can kill me 
first, Mr. Porthos will be the second and...

25:20.533 --> 25:22.995
- Aramis. 
- And Aramis, will be the last.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.511
Excuse me if I can't please all three.

25:30.901 --> 25:33.101
When did D'Artagnan arrive in Paris?

25:34.308 --> 25:35.415
This morning.

25:37.437 --> 25:39.845
Three duels in three hours 
with three musketeers.

25:39.846 --> 25:43.028
If I didn't have to kill you, 
I'd buy you a drink.

25:43.029 --> 25:44.414
Drink to my health.

26:09.163 --> 26:10.362
Athos.

26:10.363 --> 26:13.306
The Cardinal's Guard, they followed us.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.088
Are you fighting, gentlemen?

26:19.918 --> 26:21.328
Duels are prohibited.

26:21.743 --> 26:23.249
Drop your swords and follow us!

26:23.250 --> 26:24.881
My sword doesn't like dust.

26:24.882 --> 26:27.108
If you want it, come get it.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.786
Be careful, my friend.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.202
They are seven, the three of us.

26:30.609 --> 26:32.152
And Athos with one foot in the grave.

26:32.153 --> 26:34.109
I still have one to destroy.

26:34.110 --> 26:38.906
Gentlemen, I said there are three of us, 
I think there are four of us.

26:39.789 --> 26:42.040
Please kill him, he's insufferable.

26:42.041 --> 26:44.823
Gentlemen, have you made a decision yet?

26:54.400 --> 26:55.608
hope

26:57.100 --> 27:00.808
We trained this cadet only 
at Captain de Tréville's request.

27:04.110 --> 27:05.205
One for all!

27:05.608 --> 27:06.918
All for one!

29:04.869 --> 29:06.833
Are you not Lucie de Maupin's brother?

29:06.834 --> 29:08.127
Don't you dare mention it!

29:08.128 --> 29:10.899
Go away! I won't break 
your heart again.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.812
Get out or I'll change my mind!

29:16.970 --> 29:20.519
What Day is Today? I would like to know 
the date of his death.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.500
Santa Rosana, 7.

29:22.992 --> 29:24.117
The seventh, therefore.

30:05.382 --> 30:06.996
I'm still a cadet.

30:08.398 --> 30:10.306
But when I'm a musketeer, 
I'll kill you.

30:17.891 --> 30:18.891
D'Artagnan!

30:44.094 --> 30:47.806
This rivalry between our troops 
is ridiculous and hateful.

30:48.904 --> 30:52.404
We cannot let the nobles fight 
now that war is approaching.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.820
Arrest your soldiers 
and I will arrest mine.

30:55.821 --> 30:56.918
King!

31:00.598 --> 31:02.801
Here come the demons

31:03.891 --> 31:05.284
that I need to reprimand.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.811
Here they are, contrite and repentant,

31:08.916 --> 31:10.791
apologize.

31:18.295 --> 31:20.414
You yourselves cannot do justice.

31:22.312 --> 31:24.898
That right belongs to me.

31:26.099 --> 31:27.224
Just for me.

31:28.208 --> 31:31.522
Lord, we beg for your forgiveness.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.308
Who is this young man?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.815
D'Artagnan, Your Majesty.

31:49.091 --> 31:50.666
It was you who...

31:52.185 --> 31:54.716
gave that terrible blow to Jussac?

31:56.806 --> 31:58.020
Yes, Your Majesty.

31:59.114 --> 32:00.907
Finally, gods.

32:02.500 --> 32:05.203
I just loaned it to him, 
but he can't give it back.

32:13.291 --> 32:15.208
You are very arrogant, young man.

32:16.188 --> 32:17.510
It is my only wealth.

32:18.889 --> 32:20.903
And she is fully at your service.

32:21.801 --> 32:23.301
let's control

32:24.708 --> 32:28.010
before wasting everywhere.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.910
20 men in two days. It's too much.

32:34.337 --> 32:39.322
At this rate, the cardinal will need to replace 
his company within three weeks.

32:42.487 --> 32:45.206
Give that poor man some good clothes.

32:48.940 --> 32:52.106
I warned you, the king's feet...

32:56.000 --> 32:57.627
they will never give up.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.509
The next one who dares to fight,

33:04.417 --> 33:05.916
will end up in the dungeons.

33:09.797 --> 33:12.703
I've never been there, but apparently 
it's worse than England.

33:22.897 --> 33:25.003
- I see you're not dead. 
- No.

33:25.402 --> 33:27.460
No, excuse me. 
You will need to accommodate me.

33:27.461 --> 33:30.707
It is a shame. 
She ordered the coffin boards.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.203
Keep them well.

33:32.589 --> 33:34.803
I don't know if the boy will survive 
the night.

33:38.589 --> 33:39.828
Now you are rich.

33:41.653 --> 33:42.754
My father said:

33:42.755 --> 33:45.117
"Money is a good servant, 
but a bad master."

33:45.118 --> 33:47.009
Well, you were right. Pay this round.

33:50.508 --> 33:51.612
Thanks.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.696
Health!

33:55.106 --> 33:56.614
The poor guy has nothing to do.

33:56.615 --> 33:58.201
Aramis has his principles.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.318
- Is married? 
- Not exactly.

34:00.319 --> 34:03.211
Aramis is a Jesuit who sits 
between the church and the army.

34:03.212 --> 34:05.913
This morning, he's a general. 
At night, a bishop.

34:05.914 --> 34:08.018
With married women, both are possible.

34:09.511 --> 34:10.618
E Athos?

34:11.085 --> 34:12.252
He has his demons.

34:12.610 --> 34:15.214
He drowns them in alcohol, 
but they learned to swim.

34:33.408 --> 34:34.511
Aramis.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.025
Everything I told you is a lie.

34:46.027 --> 34:48.614
He told me that you are a gentleman.

34:48.616 --> 34:51.058
You see? I'm anything but that.

34:51.444 --> 34:52.902
Be careful, D'Artagnan.

34:52.904 --> 34:54.877
If Porthos takes you under his wing

34:55.795 --> 34:57.616
is to put you in his nest.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.707
- Do you like the... 
- Why not?

35:04.708 --> 35:07.304
I like anything that lands 
on my plate or my bed.

35:07.305 --> 35:10.117
- There are a lot of people! 
- Except the idiots.

35:10.118 --> 35:11.726
A pain. I would never be hungry.

35:11.727 --> 35:12.998
Let's go! Let's go!

35:13.398 --> 35:15.011
A thigh is a thigh!

35:16.500 --> 35:22.008
<i>Courageous Cadets of Gascony 
From Carbone to Casteljaloux</i>

35:22.795 --> 35:26.963
<i>Courageous Gascony Cadets</i>

35:26.964 --> 35:30.902
<i>Eagle eyes, run fast</i>

35:30.903 --> 35:34.730
<i>Attractive and sharp teeth</i>

35:34.731 --> 35:38.415
<i>We fight against street garbage</i>

35:38.416 --> 35:40.898
<i>Eagle eyes, run fast</i>

35:40.899 --> 35:45.121
<i>With a hat regardless of the weather 
They hide the holes with feathers</i>

36:44.913 --> 36:46.418
Hello. Good morning...

36:50.908 --> 36:52.018
Did you sleep well?

36:52.411 --> 36:54.021
Hello, good morning, Constance.

36:54.414 --> 36:55.627
Good morning Constance.

37:14.892 --> 37:16.108
Please!

37:18.606 --> 37:19.705
No!

37:20.098 --> 37:21.211
No!

37:24.371 --> 37:27.092
Ladies and gentlemen, Athos d'Hauteville,

37:27.093 --> 37:31.901
Count of La Fère, fought in Flanders 
against the United Provinces,

37:32.611 --> 37:37.550
in Bavaria against the Holy Empire, 
in the Palatinate, in Lombardy and Savoy.

37:37.551 --> 37:41.004
He has fought more battles than there are 
spectators in this room.

37:42.697 --> 37:44.218
shouldn't be here

37:45.009 --> 37:46.421
but on a pedestal.

37:52.521 --> 37:56.033
Thanks Captain, 
but we don't judge statues here.

37:56.904 --> 37:58.410
We judge men.

37:59.891 --> 38:00.891
Conde,

38:01.791 --> 38:04.406
you come 
from one of the great families in the country.

38:05.299 --> 38:10.003
But your blood and your titles 
do not protect you, on the contrary.

38:10.808 --> 38:14.620
He who is born noble 
should lead a dignified life.

38:15.193 --> 38:21.409
His brother, Benjamin de la Fère, 
is a famous supporter of La Rochelle.

38:23.003 --> 38:24.823
Are you Protestant?

38:26.099 --> 38:28.006
Yes I am.

38:29.299 --> 38:30.591
You believe in God?

38:33.897 --> 38:36.503
I believe in God, the king and France.

38:40.507 --> 38:44.997
According to the gospel of Saint John, 
when Jesus meets Pilate, he tells him:

38:44.998 --> 38:48.510
I came into the world to bear witness to the truth.

38:48.511 --> 38:50.099
And Pilate will answer:

38:50.100 --> 38:51.621
What is the truth?

38:51.622 --> 38:52.813
Exactly.

38:54.099 --> 39:00.109
They arrested you this morning, drunk, 
covered in blood, and dagger in hand.

39:00.605 --> 39:03.606
With a murdered stranger in his bed.

39:04.404 --> 39:06.613
So now I ask the truth.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.095
Did you kill this woman?

39:22.000 --> 39:23.716
Did you kill this woman?

39:28.208 --> 39:29.314
I don't know.

39:30.598 --> 39:32.611
Can't you lie like everyone else?

39:33.605 --> 39:34.805
You do not know?

39:36.509 --> 39:37.509
No.

39:40.395 --> 39:42.419
And I will not lie to avoid death.

39:43.092 --> 39:44.806
I have no attachment to life.

39:49.708 --> 39:55.321
Count, the greatest wealth a gentleman 
can leave is his example.

39:56.115 --> 39:57.698
His life has been exemplary.

39:58.004 --> 40:01.104
Then your death will be even more.

40:01.511 --> 40:06.015
Capital punishment for the common is death, 
for the noble, beheading.

40:07.604 --> 40:10.479
Knight Athos d'Hauteville, 
Count of La Fère,

40:10.480 --> 40:13.878
the court sentences you to be 
beheaded with the sword

40:13.879 --> 40:15.915
this second in Place de Grève.

40:25.308 --> 40:27.202
We will appeal that sentence!

40:27.203 --> 40:28.207
Right.

40:28.208 --> 40:31.829
You have four days to prove your innocence 
or ask the king for mercy.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.151
May God be with you.

40:45.156 --> 40:48.370
If Athos refuses to defend himself, 
we will defend him.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.729
Identify this woman and find out 
why she was with Athos.

40:51.731 --> 40:53.106
It is our only hope.

41:47.185 --> 41:48.908
No rings, no necklaces, nothing.

41:49.502 --> 41:52.225
I only found 
stabbing marks on her.

41:52.226 --> 41:53.505
A whore?

41:53.506 --> 41:55.598
Look at those delicate hands.

41:56.407 --> 41:59.203
This woman never worked.

41:59.605 --> 42:00.605
Are you well?

42:00.957 --> 42:05.006
-A bourgeoisie or a noblewoman. 
-Can I see her face?

42:20.801 --> 42:22.418
It's the woman who tried to kill me.

42:56.208 --> 42:57.320
I did not do nothing.

42:58.689 --> 42:59.827
I did not do nothing!

43:01.311 --> 43:02.711
I thought I was dead!

43:12.394 --> 43:14.119
I swear I never saw them.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.411
Go ahead, go ahead.

43:15.897 --> 43:17.018
Cave.

43:43.285 --> 43:44.448
Anything.

43:44.449 --> 43:46.498
We will never know who they were.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.724
Was he wearing a ring?

44:28.199 --> 44:29.699
He gets another leg.

44:39.293 --> 44:40.720
Of course yes.

44:41.446 --> 44:42.859
Where is the ring?

44:44.219 --> 44:46.511
I want to know who this man was.

45:08.904 --> 45:10.037
What are you doing?

45:10.395 --> 45:12.027
I hate getting my knives dirty.

45:12.028 --> 45:13.419
You will go to hell.

45:16.958 --> 45:18.509
I can't stand torture.

45:19.613 --> 45:21.810
Like everyone else, 
that's why it works.

45:24.895 --> 45:29.778
Hail Mary, full of grace, 
the Lord is with you.

45:29.779 --> 45:31.582
Pray for us sinners...

45:31.583 --> 45:32.696
Are you afraid of God?

45:33.103 --> 45:35.717
If God saw me now and didn't want

45:35.718 --> 45:38.499
If I did what I'm going to do, 
I'd throw lightning at me.

45:39.016 --> 45:41.160
And look how clear the sky is today.

45:41.161 --> 45:42.219
Pity!

45:47.212 --> 45:48.513
What are you doing?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.126
Talking to him.

45:50.127 --> 45:51.192
Talking to him?

45:52.306 --> 45:54.529
Aramis' words 
are worse than daggers.

45:55.404 --> 45:58.901
There are three rings. 
The idiot can't remember what they were.

45:59.911 --> 46:02.409
Three golden helmets: 
Brissac d'Argis family.

46:02.410 --> 46:05.618
Crowned lion, three roses: 
the Dardel de Luzinais family.

46:06.606 --> 46:08.924
An eagle and two swords: Valcour family.

46:10.305 --> 46:12.362
We're three rings from our man.

46:12.363 --> 46:14.261
And the woman who was with them.

46:14.262 --> 46:16.299
At dawn, we will knock on your door.

46:16.675 --> 46:19.092
With God's help, we will save Athos.

46:41.799 --> 46:44.799
NORMANDY BEACH

47:19.794 --> 47:21.710
Welcome to France, Lord Buckingham.

47:22.224 --> 47:24.509
- Was your trip good? 
- Very still.

47:25.209 --> 47:27.327
I didn't plan on seeing you before La Rochelle.

47:27.692 --> 47:28.817
Me neither.

47:29.206 --> 47:31.312
But he couldn't refuse 
the queen's invitation.

48:10.398 --> 48:11.898
What's the matter, sir?

48:12.890 --> 48:15.923
You are here, but your mind 
is elsewhere.

48:15.924 --> 48:19.897
Gaston received a letter 
from his fiancée yesterday.

48:21.352 --> 48:23.203
He read to his men,

48:23.204 --> 48:27.081
ridiculed a 16-year-old girl's words of love .

48:27.082 --> 48:28.708
It will take time to get used to.

48:29.679 --> 48:31.425
Gaston is not a tender man.

48:40.957 --> 48:44.600
What does your brother want,

48:45.666 --> 48:47.838
a marriage cannot satisfy you.

48:50.989 --> 48:56.434
Sometimes I wish I wasn't king 
and that he reigned in my place.

48:58.867 --> 48:59.867
Luís.

49:00.398 --> 49:02.920
You are king by the grace of God.

49:09.083 --> 49:11.747
Perhaps I should accompany you 
to the Val de Grâce.

49:12.666 --> 49:16.141
Father Arnoux is a good adviser. 
He can calm me down.

49:20.950 --> 49:25.480
If that's what Your Majesty wants, 
I'd like it.

49:28.035 --> 49:30.035
No. Another time, perhaps.

49:31.172 --> 49:34.310
Come see me right after confession.

49:35.981 --> 49:37.064
Madam...

50:27.370 --> 50:28.951
- What do you want? 
- Good morning.

50:28.952 --> 50:31.546
I would like to see the Count of Valcour.

50:31.547 --> 50:32.625
He is not here.

50:32.626 --> 50:35.126
One moment. It belongs to him.

50:40.726 --> 50:44.142
I'll see if the Countess 
can see you, follow me.

51:21.903 --> 51:24.595
Isabelle de Valcour, delighted.

51:24.596 --> 51:25.707
You may come in.

51:42.684 --> 51:45.122
I hope I'm not causing 
any trouble.

51:45.773 --> 51:49.530
On the contrary. 
I appreciate a little distraction.

51:51.197 --> 51:54.686
Your face is familiar to me. Have we seen each other?

51:56.200 --> 52:00.868
I'm sure if I had seen you, 
I wouldn't have forgotten you.

52:01.387 --> 52:03.890
I just arrived from Gascony.

52:03.891 --> 52:05.369
My name is D'Artagnan.

52:10.969 --> 52:14.044
Excuse me, you can sit down. 
Please.

52:14.045 --> 52:15.046
Thanks.

52:18.321 --> 52:21.376
I was locked up here for months 
because of the fever.

52:21.377 --> 52:23.414
Forget good manners.

52:23.415 --> 52:25.787
I hope it's better now.

52:25.788 --> 52:27.830
I think I can survive.

52:31.859 --> 52:33.421
What can I do for you?

52:34.286 --> 52:35.631
Okay, sorry.

52:36.647 --> 52:40.994
This got to me a few days ago.

52:41.372 --> 52:44.494
I need to find its owner. 
This is very important.

52:45.488 --> 52:46.612
Let me see.

52:52.111 --> 52:54.478
It's Tancred's ring.

52:55.122 --> 52:56.242
Tancredo?

52:56.243 --> 52:57.540
My brother.

52:58.202 --> 52:59.471
Where is he, Madam?

52:59.472 --> 53:01.693
Inland, buying horses.

53:01.694 --> 53:04.682
He will be very happy. 
It was stolen last month.

53:04.683 --> 53:06.267
He was inconsolable.

53:09.427 --> 53:10.469
Last month?

53:11.610 --> 53:13.610
You seem to be disappointed.

53:15.246 --> 53:16.592
Is nothing.

53:16.593 --> 53:21.215
I'm happy for your brother, 
but my mission ends here.

53:21.216 --> 53:23.050
How much mystery.

53:25.083 --> 53:26.083
True.

53:29.197 --> 53:33.088
Now I leave you, madam. 
My colleagues are waiting for me.

53:34.895 --> 53:36.687
Perhaps they are luckier.

53:41.122 --> 53:43.957
Thank you very much for coming here.

53:43.958 --> 53:46.125
You have done me a great service.

53:46.126 --> 53:47.416
It was a pleasure.

53:47.976 --> 53:50.028
I assure you not.

53:52.445 --> 53:55.893
It is not necessary 
for you to accompany me.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.462
If you'll excuse me. Madam.

55:14.148 --> 55:15.148
Sir.

55:51.875 --> 55:52.875
Good morning lady.

55:53.375 --> 55:54.375
Good day sir.

55:54.875 --> 55:57.491
I could use 
your sewing skills.

55:57.492 --> 55:58.988
What do you want to sew?

56:00.415 --> 56:01.833
Well, myself.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.166
Come with me.

56:09.721 --> 56:13.000
You had luck. 
It almost touches your heart.

56:14.291 --> 56:15.791
My heart is already hurt.

56:21.416 --> 56:23.562
Use words of love lightly, sir.

56:27.916 --> 56:29.833
These were not words of love.

56:32.166 --> 56:34.583
Next time I'll sew your mouth shut.

56:34.584 --> 56:36.092
All right, I'll shut up.

56:38.208 --> 56:39.208
Pronto.

56:40.791 --> 56:41.791
Thanks.

56:50.333 --> 56:52.583
Please don't move.

56:53.291 --> 56:54.500
I'm not moving.

56:58.416 --> 56:59.845
You did it again!

56:59.846 --> 57:02.555
I told you, I didn't move.

57:03.708 --> 57:06.250
It must be my heart 
pounding in my chest.

57:13.083 --> 57:17.437
If you keep looking at me like that, 
I won't be able to finish healing you.

57:17.438 --> 57:20.916
Well, then I'll look there, 
it will be easier for you.

57:21.602 --> 57:23.540
Is it too much? I know.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.583
That way we'll be calm.

57:30.166 --> 57:31.708
Where does it leave from?

57:32.486 --> 57:35.329
- From Isabelle de Valcour. 
- Do you know her?

57:35.330 --> 57:37.833
No, she was murdered a few days ago.

57:38.378 --> 57:40.904
There was another lady in her place 
who shot me.

57:41.738 --> 57:44.124
- You must notify the queen. 
- The Queen?

57:44.125 --> 57:48.305
Isabelle de Valcour 
was Buckingham's messenger.

57:49.305 --> 57:50.958
It will be a trap. Come with me.

58:08.375 --> 58:11.416
VAL DE GRÂCE ABBEY

58:23.833 --> 58:25.000
Wait here.

58:36.166 --> 58:37.249
Lord Abbot.

58:37.250 --> 58:39.582
It's an honor to have you here, sir.

58:39.583 --> 58:40.958
Follow me, please.

59:23.958 --> 59:25.650
It's crazy.

59:25.651 --> 59:29.456
I would risk my life and my honor 
to be with you for a few seconds.

59:29.457 --> 59:32.723
- But it's too dangerous. 
- I know. I know.

59:33.124 --> 59:35.124
I came as soon as I received the invitation.

59:35.125 --> 59:36.958
My invitation?

59:37.458 --> 59:38.833
My invitation?

59:39.684 --> 59:40.684
No.

59:41.791 --> 59:43.291
Where are your men?

01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:49.541
You!

01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:10.375
Don't be afraid, 
I'm the one they're looking for.

01:01:26.757 --> 01:01:27.757
It's him.

01:01:27.758 --> 01:01:30.564
- He kidnapped the Countess of Valcour! 
- Let her go!

01:02:12.911 --> 01:02:15.126
You fear losing me, 
I see it in your eyes.

01:02:15.127 --> 01:02:18.971
If your love means death, 
I don't want to live another day.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.750
If you cry it's because you love me.

01:02:24.096 --> 01:02:26.516
I am loyal to my king.

01:02:26.924 --> 01:02:30.674
I'm his wife and I will never cheat on him.

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:34.577
You must forget me 
and forget this love.

01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:37.182
If you ask me not to come back, 
I will.

01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:47.041
Give me at least 
proof of your love.

01:02:47.042 --> 01:02:49.291
Remembering that it was not a dream.

01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:54.333
If I give you what you ask, 
will you do what I ask?

01:02:54.334 --> 01:02:55.334
Immediately.

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.538
Go away and never come back.

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:15.375
You are welcome.

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.125
From now on

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.208
united by a secret.

01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:12.432
I won't live long enough 
to pay them.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:18.666
If you need help 
from the Queen of France, count on her.

01:04:19.315 --> 01:04:23.125
That day is closer than you think.

01:04:25.386 --> 01:04:28.205
There is another victim in this plot.

01:04:28.666 --> 01:04:29.912
a musketeer,

01:04:29.913 --> 01:04:32.893
sentenced to death 
for a crime he did not commit.

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:51.541
Good?

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:57.666
It was horrible and... 
And beautiful at the same time.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.958
They kissed trembling.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:02.251
She handed him the necklace.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.613
The Duke of Buckingham told you something...

01:05:05.614 --> 01:05:08.153
very nice, before leaving:

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.375
"I'll be gone… 
but I'll keep you close."

01:05:14.666 --> 01:05:16.166
Is very sad.

01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:20.125
Yes. I should have kissed her.

01:05:22.623 --> 01:05:24.862
You are using words 
that are not mine.

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:37.958
Thanks.

01:05:40.375 --> 01:05:42.291
Your life does not belong to you.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.750
She is the queen of France.

01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:48.125
Sim.

01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:50.875
But yours is not.

01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:58.708
Constance.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.456
I see I changed you.

01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:06.125
- You blushed. 
- No!

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:07.765
Clear.

01:06:07.766 --> 01:06:09.657
You're wrong, that's not why.

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:15.189
It is out of modesty, 
because of your flattery.

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.213
No.

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:29.583
Goodnight.

01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:32.416
- It's not that way. 
- I already know.

01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:03.236
What were you doing 
in Val de Grâce yesterday?

01:07:03.238 --> 01:07:04.779
I went to see Abbot Arnoux.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.750
Would not be...

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:18.506
the Buckingham who wore the cassock?

01:07:18.507 --> 01:07:20.591
What? What are you talking?

01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:29.375
What all of Paris is talking about.

01:07:32.441 --> 01:07:34.957
Did the cardinal tell you this infamy?

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:35.998
Does not matter.

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:42.750
Will not you answer me?

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:46.000
What does this serpent accuse me of?

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:48.125
Looks...

01:07:48.838 --> 01:07:51.231
that you gave the English your necklace.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.458
Are here.

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:02.666
Open the box...

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:06.203
if you don't trust me.

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:10.458
Come.

01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:12.666
Check out.

01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:17.250
Show me how little respect 
you have for me.

01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:23.250
If your wife's word is worth less 
than anyone else's.

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:40.666
Come.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:49.957
Right.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.758
Rumors must be silenced.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:56.022
Next Saturday, 
at Gaston's wedding,

01:08:56.023 --> 01:08:57.483
you will wear your necklace.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:02.667
Very well, sir.

01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:04.335
If it's your will.

01:09:08.707 --> 01:09:11.291
And as for your musketeer,

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:13.791
he killed a countess.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.337
He will be beheaded.

01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:19.082
It is also my will.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.250
You must leave for London tonight.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.478
You will attend the first ball 
attended by the Duke.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.957
He will have the necklace.

01:09:42.419 --> 01:09:45.919
Buckingham is one of the 
most protected men in England.

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:49.375
It will be expensive then.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.910
Visit my treasurer 
and he will pay you.

01:09:56.916 --> 01:10:01.500
I'll pay double if I come back on Saturday, 
Gaston's wedding day.

01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:08.916
The king showed no mercy 
to his musketeer.

01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:13.875
He is more concerned about his fate 
than that of his men.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.833
I'm like him.

01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:19.833
Don't let me down.

01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:26.833
I regret not being able to attend 
this execution.

01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:29.500
bring me the necklace

01:10:30.583 --> 01:10:33.416
and you can meet the queen.

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:53.750
We cannot allow this!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.082
No one can do justice for the king 
and no one can escape it.

01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:00.166
But he is innocent!

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:04.958
It's over.

01:11:06.416 --> 01:11:08.250
Nothing can be done for Athos.

01:11:22.458 --> 01:11:23.666
<i>"Dear friends,</i>

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:25.583
<i>no need to be sad.</i>

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500
<i>Today is a good day to die.</i>

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:34.333
<i>I gave everything in life, death has 
very little to take back.</i>

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:44.916
<i>Aramis, I leave you my rosary.</i>

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.458
<i>I'm sure 
you'll make good use of it.</i>

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.833
<i>Porthos, you can have my watch.</i>

01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:00.666
<i>I know you will like it.</i>

01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:03.260
<i>d'Artagnan,</i>

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.495
<i>I didn't have the opportunity 
to get to know him well.</i>

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.708
<i>I leave you my sword.</i>

01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:11.250
<i>I know you'll know 
how to use it well.</i>

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:15.541
<i>We were the three musketeers.</i>

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.708
<i>And thanks to you, D'Artagnan,</i>

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:21.500
<i>we will continue to be.</i>

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:24.125
<i>My friends,</i>

01:12:24.833 --> 01:12:28.708
<i>I leave with a light heart, 
head held high,</i>

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.916
<i>Proud to have fought alongside you.</i>

01:12:38.491 --> 01:12:39.491
<i>To the next.</i>

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.231
<i>Long live to the king.</i>

01:12:41.833 --> 01:12:43.291
<i>And long live France."</i>

01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:09.737
Back! Back!

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:55.958
Get out of the way!

01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.839
It's a rebellion.

01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:02.791
I warned you.

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.061
I swear to you, captain.

01:15:04.062 --> 01:15:06.692
For the life of us, it wasn't us.

01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:12.211
I only know one man willing 
to risk his life for Athos.

01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:21.333
Benjamin.

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:23.416
Benjamin!

01:15:25.301 --> 01:15:27.515
I said we'd see each other in hell.

01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:29.497
Brandicourt.

01:15:29.498 --> 01:15:30.632
Saint-Blancard.

01:15:30.633 --> 01:15:33.258
Your brother convinced us 
that we had to save him.

01:15:33.787 --> 01:15:36.358
I never thought 
I'd be so happy to see you.

01:15:38.416 --> 01:15:39.750
Catholic songs?

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:41.875
Did you convert?

01:15:44.593 --> 01:15:48.125
To fight the enemy 
you need to know him well.

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:55.333
Benjamin de la Fère, brother of Athos.

01:15:55.797 --> 01:15:57.790
He is Saint-Blancard's right-hand man.

01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:58.832
Saint-Blancard?

01:15:58.833 --> 01:16:00.916
The leader of the Protestants of La Rochelle.

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:28.000
What's up, captain?

01:16:29.166 --> 01:16:31.375
A letter from Cardinal Richelieu.

01:16:41.195 --> 01:16:42.445
Close the doors!

01:16:50.621 --> 01:16:52.838
They couldn't 
make you a Catholic,

01:16:52.839 --> 01:16:54.721
they want to cut off your Protestant head.

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:58.041
Treville could do nothing, 
nor could his king.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:03.250
Richelieu is the one who governs this country.

01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:08.458
We will create a Protestant republic.

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:09.875
Autonomous.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:12.625
Join us.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.401
Join your people.

01:17:14.402 --> 01:17:16.512
Let's attack the kingdom in the heart.

01:17:17.073 --> 01:17:19.246
War is approaching. 
You must choose a side.

01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:38.250
They accuse us 
of having freed Athos.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.998
No one can leave here.

01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:43.333
Silence!

01:17:45.125 --> 01:17:47.958
I will go to the king and plead with him 
on our behalf.

01:17:47.959 --> 01:17:50.932
Aramis, Porthos, DeQuillac e Bercquet.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.871
If anyone moves, shoot them.

01:17:53.872 --> 01:17:55.666
Uzan and Ventadour, follow me.

01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:06.499
Quarantine is reserved 
for musketeers.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.156
You can go, D'Artagnan.

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:48.958
Do not stop.

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.333
Follow me.

01:18:54.808 --> 01:18:56.041
In England?

01:18:58.816 --> 01:19:00.441
You are my only hope.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.916
The cardinal wants to overthrow the queen.

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:07.125
It takes courage, 
but above all caution.

01:19:08.892 --> 01:19:11.968
Your wishes are my orders. 
I'm leaving right away.

01:19:12.519 --> 01:19:14.519
Hang on. Take it.

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:16.458
It's for the trip.

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:19.875
I've had enough reward.

01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:22.637
If I can, 
maybe you'll like me.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:24.916
Do not be afraid.

01:19:26.125 --> 01:19:27.875
I'll get the necklace.

01:21:43.958 --> 01:21:44.958
Athos?

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:51.416
Is this how you fight with my sword?

01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:03.333
How did you find me?

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.958
By Miss. Bonacieux.

01:22:07.607 --> 01:22:10.666
Beware of love, D'Artagnan. 
It's worse than war.

01:22:11.666 --> 01:22:13.353
Have you ever been in love?

01:22:13.354 --> 01:22:16.206
Look around you, 
with it comes all misfortunes.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.958
I do not think...

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:23.500
Let love lead us astray.

01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:32.375
I'll tell you a story.

01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:34.875
It happened to you?

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:36.583
No.

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:39.083
With a close friend.

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:41.498
A long time ago. 
With a young earl.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.208
While roaming his lands, 
he met a young woman.

01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:52.375
She wasn't pretty, she was intoxicating.

01:22:55.541 --> 01:23:00.250
She was so beautiful, so pure... he could 
have seduced her, even forced her.

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:03.327
And even though he knew the war, 
his heart remained

01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:06.416
noble

01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:09.416
and sincere.

01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:16.583
<i>She hated society life.</i>

01:23:17.585 --> 01:23:19.335
<i>They got married in secret.</i>

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:21.845
<i>Without the family.</i>

01:23:23.009 --> 01:23:25.589
<i>They lived together for over a year.</i>

01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:27.666
<i>They went out into the world.</i>

01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:30.375
They were very happy.

01:23:31.916 --> 01:23:33.250
The happiness

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.166
it couldn't last.

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.125
The young earl had a brother.

01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.458
He was also going to get married.

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:49.750
The earl was forced 
to attend the wedding.

01:23:51.166 --> 01:23:56.000
This time his wife 
agreed to accompany him.

01:23:58.291 --> 01:24:01.250
When he introduced her to his brother,

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:03.958
turned white.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:10.291
He thought he recognized a woman 
he'd met in Paris.

01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:16.958
That night, in your chambers,

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:19.708
you confessed the whole truth.

01:24:21.666 --> 01:24:23.875
She was the woman his brother knew.

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:27.320
Well, it wasn't her anymore.

01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:29.875
She had run away.

01:24:30.906 --> 01:24:34.916
<i>Married at age 15 to a marquis, 
she had to endure the worst horrors.</i>

01:24:36.666 --> 01:24:40.604
One night, when he was trying 
to get what she didn't want to give him,

01:24:40.605 --> 01:24:41.916
she defended herself.

01:24:43.791 --> 01:24:45.083
It's us.

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:50.422
Terrified, afraid of being arrested,

01:24:50.423 --> 01:24:55.416
she runs away under an assumed name 
and starts a life based on lies.

01:24:57.416 --> 01:24:58.958
And what did the earl do?

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:01.291
The count?

01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:09.916
The earl was a great lord.

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:16.583
In his lands he dispensed justice.

01:25:17.458 --> 01:25:20.416
He was worried 
about his title and position.

01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:26.958
He turned the fugitive over to the authorities.

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.333
They judged her and condemned her,

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:32.583
they marked her

01:25:34.291 --> 01:25:35.416
and they hanged her.

01:26:55.583 --> 01:26:58.541
INGLATERRA
CASTELO DE BUCKINGHAM

01:27:13.625 --> 01:27:14.749
Good?

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:18.541
There are enough soldiers 
to send them on a crusade to Jerusalem.

01:27:20.666 --> 01:27:23.751
Please. 
I don't know if that will be enough.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.916
Maybe that's enough.

01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:57.083
I see a certain irony in the choice of costume.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:58.750
Serious?

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:03.750
It would be very easy 
for the Sea God to invade France.

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:07.750
Do I know you, Harley Quinn?

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.666
Perhaps yes.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:12.562
Maybe not.

01:29:12.563 --> 01:29:13.958
Italian?

01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:17.301
I'm in love with Italy,

01:29:18.818 --> 01:29:20.171
but not.

01:29:21.284 --> 01:29:23.202
Maybe a lady from Spain?

01:29:23.203 --> 01:29:28.316
The wind changes every day, 
I change every second.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.166
I see you've traveled a lot.

01:29:31.979 --> 01:29:36.806
I love getting to know new places, 
my prince.

01:29:38.982 --> 01:29:40.774
I need a drink.

01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:21.106
The calm after the storm.

01:30:22.794 --> 01:30:24.458
Or maybe before the storm.

01:30:36.916 --> 01:30:39.908
You drink 
like someone who has something to forget.

01:30:39.909 --> 01:30:41.025
It is not?

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.458
If it worked.

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:27.583
Don't leave here!

01:32:34.166 --> 01:32:36.874
Do not kill me! Please! Buckingham.

01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:39.275
Calm down! I know this man.

01:32:39.276 --> 01:32:41.812
Just when I was 
starting to enjoy the party.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.582
Is the queen in danger?

01:32:55.583 --> 01:32:57.219
By order of the king,

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.913
the Queen is to wear on Saturday 
at Gaston's wedding,

01:33:00.914 --> 01:33:04.541
the necklace you know well.

01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:06.958
Thy will be done.

01:33:12.801 --> 01:33:13.874
What an idiot!

01:33:13.875 --> 01:33:16.519
A woman. 
Very pretty, brunette, light eyes.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.895
Harlequin costume.

01:33:17.896 --> 01:33:19.979
You two, with me.

01:33:27.708 --> 01:33:28.875
<i>Stop her!</i>

01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:50.083
Take it!

01:35:13.916 --> 01:35:15.125
The collar.

01:35:20.625 --> 01:35:22.541
I keep seeing you.

01:35:23.125 --> 01:35:24.583
Do you love me that much?

01:35:25.564 --> 01:35:26.731
The collar!

01:35:39.458 --> 01:35:41.125
For who you work?

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.583
Maybe to hell.

01:35:48.791 --> 01:35:51.541
I see a glint in your eyes, D'Artagnan.

01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:58.258
With this light, I will light 
a fire that will devour you.

01:35:58.668 --> 01:35:59.708
No!

01:36:24.083 --> 01:36:26.041
PARIS

01:36:37.947 --> 01:36:39.175
Your Eminence.

01:36:39.176 --> 01:36:41.785
The ship arrived in Calais, 
but she was not on board.

01:37:15.052 --> 01:37:16.696
This way, gentlemen.

01:37:24.082 --> 01:37:26.059
Thank our friend.

01:37:30.119 --> 01:37:33.875
The ways of the Lord are mysterious.

01:37:47.974 --> 01:37:51.818
Are you ready for the 
most important moment of your lives?

01:38:16.708 --> 01:38:17.791
Your Eminence.

01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:18.917
Sir.

01:38:35.236 --> 01:38:37.583
The king awaits you, Your Majesty.

01:38:42.414 --> 01:38:44.608
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

01:38:52.417 --> 01:38:53.471
Let's go!

01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:04.723
Eminence, have you seen my brother?

01:39:04.724 --> 01:39:05.738
Vi.

01:39:07.133 --> 01:39:10.239
Will he forgive me 
for making him marry?

01:39:11.086 --> 01:39:13.197
He looked like he was about to go out the front.

01:39:14.788 --> 01:39:17.727
Soon he will learn that marriage 
is like war,

01:39:18.282 --> 01:39:21.996
- but there are no winners. 
- Well, everybody wins.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.662
Your Highness, her beauty is awe-inspiring.

01:39:46.958 --> 01:39:47.958
Madam.

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:53.195
Why aren't you wearing your aiguillettes?

01:39:53.508 --> 01:39:55.891
I'm going to wear them to prom tonight.

01:40:00.607 --> 01:40:02.156
It wasn't a good idea.

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:04.323
Go get them.

01:40:05.261 --> 01:40:07.101
But your brother is waiting for us.

01:40:08.291 --> 01:40:09.496
He will wait.

01:40:43.803 --> 01:40:45.333
Your Highness.

01:40:49.784 --> 01:40:53.810
There's a boy wanting to see you, 
it seems urgent.

01:40:54.723 --> 01:40:55.887
He is here!

01:41:12.208 --> 01:41:13.433
Tell me you have them.

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.332
- He tells me. 
- Are here.

01:41:16.585 --> 01:41:17.717
Here it is.

01:41:17.718 --> 01:41:19.197
Thank God.

01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:21.845
"God" is too much, 
"My love" is enough.

01:41:21.846 --> 01:41:23.940
Do you never stop?

01:41:25.493 --> 01:41:26.791
Constancy?

01:41:26.792 --> 01:41:28.011
Sim?

01:41:28.472 --> 01:41:29.674
Eu...

01:41:31.033 --> 01:41:32.629
He tells me...

01:41:34.247 --> 01:41:35.502
that you don't love me.

01:41:36.486 --> 01:41:39.947
Tell me: "D'Artagnan, I don't love you", 
and I swear to you that...

01:41:57.988 --> 01:42:00.000
Just like that for you to be quiet.

01:42:32.251 --> 01:42:34.396
You were right, Eminence.

01:42:34.397 --> 01:42:36.386
They were just rumours.

01:42:36.387 --> 01:42:39.631
The queen deserved my trust.

01:42:57.465 --> 01:42:58.517
Thanks.

01:44:02.062 --> 01:44:03.332
D'Artagnan.

01:44:05.921 --> 01:44:07.876
- You are here? 
- Yes.

01:44:07.877 --> 01:44:09.589
You're alive, where have you been?

01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:10.778
In England.

01:44:10.779 --> 01:44:12.227
- Why? 
- Together with Athos.

01:45:47.011 --> 01:45:50.572
To fight the enemy, 
you have to know him well.

01:45:52.434 --> 01:45:54.598
Let's attack the kingdom through the heart.

01:46:15.812 --> 01:46:17.757
Gaston of France,

01:46:17.758 --> 01:46:21.659
Duke of Orléans, Valois and Anjou, 
you accept Marie de Bourbon,

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:25.541
Duchess of Montpensier, 
as lawful wife?

01:46:25.542 --> 01:46:26.945
Accepted.

01:46:28.278 --> 01:46:34.037
Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, 
do you accept Gaston of France,

01:46:34.038 --> 01:46:36.836
Duke of Orléans, Valois and Anjou, 
as legitimate husband?

01:46:36.837 --> 01:46:38.006
Accepted.

01:46:45.185 --> 01:46:49.741
In the name of the Father, the Son 
and the Holy Church,

01:46:51.923 --> 01:46:54.520
I declare you husband and wife.

01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:58.466
Shooter! Shooter!

01:47:07.784 --> 01:47:09.083
Back!

01:47:11.606 --> 01:47:12.981
Protect the king!

01:47:12.982 --> 01:47:14.831
The monks! The monks!

01:47:16.392 --> 01:47:17.525
This way!

01:48:21.345 --> 01:48:22.467
Come here!

01:48:23.937 --> 01:48:25.030
I am going!

01:48:58.164 --> 01:49:00.451
E o Conde Montecler d'Auvigné?

01:49:00.452 --> 01:49:02.662
He died two days ago, sir.

01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:06.798
And Beaulieu de Verricout?

01:49:06.799 --> 01:49:09.309
Head injury, 
he won't survive.

01:49:15.926 --> 01:49:17.176
Prisoners?

01:49:18.821 --> 01:49:21.194
Achille Brandicourt
e Nicolas Beaumont.

01:49:21.195 --> 01:49:23.323
Extremist Protestants from La Rochelle.

01:49:23.739 --> 01:49:26.691
They carried coded letters, 
we deciphered them.

01:49:29.187 --> 01:49:33.392
I will interrogate them myself 
and they will hand over their accomplices.

01:49:34.914 --> 01:49:38.025
I count on your talent 
as a confessor, Your Eminence.

01:50:06.813 --> 01:50:08.978
Prepare the troops for La Rochelle.

01:50:14.319 --> 01:50:15.880
They didn't want my peace.

01:50:16.716 --> 01:50:18.667
Then we'll see if they want my war.

01:50:19.113 --> 01:50:21.270
We're going to take the village from the Protestants.

01:50:21.271 --> 01:50:22.893
I am leaving now.

01:50:43.756 --> 01:50:46.264
For your exceptional service

01:50:46.897 --> 01:50:49.432
to the French crown

01:50:50.346 --> 01:50:53.299
I name you Charles D'Artagnan,

01:50:54.288 --> 01:50:57.307
lieutenant of the company of musketeers.

01:50:59.658 --> 01:51:02.173
I will live up to that honor, Your Majesty.

01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:08.840
Armand de Sillegue d'Athos d'Hauteville,

01:51:09.581 --> 01:51:11.232
Conde de la Fere...

01:51:12.898 --> 01:51:15.208
I owe you my life, sir.

01:51:17.557 --> 01:51:20.332
And with that gesture, I assure you.

01:51:21.247 --> 01:51:23.019
you will be forgiven

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:27.419
and will immediately return 
to the corps of musketeers.

01:51:27.726 --> 01:51:32.000
I offer you my life 
and gladly lay it down, Lord.

01:51:36.018 --> 01:51:37.783
You may rise, gentlemen.

01:51:43.968 --> 01:51:47.944
Gentlemen, here are the famous 
three musketeers,

01:51:49.717 --> 01:51:51.356
and that now there are four.

01:51:59.082 --> 01:52:01.832
Long live to the king!

01:52:02.352 --> 01:52:04.571
Long live the queen!

01:52:10.833 --> 01:52:12.294
Long live the queen!

01:52:13.088 --> 01:52:14.458
Long live to the king!

01:52:32.813 --> 01:52:34.203
Your Majesty.

01:52:34.726 --> 01:52:35.958
D'Artagnan.

01:52:37.739 --> 01:52:39.958
I have no title to offer you.

01:52:40.389 --> 01:52:42.869
Just my eternal gratitude.

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.250
It's the best gift you could give me.

01:52:47.251 --> 01:52:48.286
No.

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:52.800
At the cost of her life, Constance Bonacieux 
was my messenger.

01:52:52.801 --> 01:52:55.352
Today she is yours.

01:52:55.353 --> 01:52:59.627
I'll be waiting for you at 10 pm 
at the Red Hat Tavern.

01:53:00.636 --> 01:53:02.888
Don't be late, musketeer.

01:53:38.784 --> 01:53:41.761
I have finished, 
you may accompany Your Majesty.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:53.556
Let's get the Protestants 
of France repudiated.

01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:56.725
Everything will happen according to plan.

01:53:57.444 --> 01:54:00.355
The country's Protestants 
will be seen for what they are.

01:54:01.210 --> 01:54:02.468
traitors.

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:09.425
We failed, as you saw, 
but the king will not escape death.

01:54:09.426 --> 01:54:11.790
It is now in your hands.

01:54:12.416 --> 01:54:15.583
You'll have your war, 
and soon you'll take control of the country.

01:54:15.584 --> 01:54:17.892
Don't worry about the prisoner.

01:54:17.893 --> 01:54:20.000
Our friend will take care of him.

01:54:20.001 --> 01:54:23.438
By the grace of God, our time has come.

01:54:57.503 --> 01:54:58.875
Socorro!

01:54:59.356 --> 01:55:00.935
D'Artagnan!

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:06.568
Constancy!

01:55:09.958 --> 01:55:11.345
Let me go!

01:55:12.625 --> 01:55:13.625
Socorro!

HAS POST-CREDIT SCENES

01:57:22.863 --> 01:57:24.196
Your Eminence?

01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:29.424
You already gave me orders 
about your enemy,

01:57:29.425 --> 01:57:31.958
Can you tell me about mine?

01:57:31.959 --> 01:57:33.331
Who are we talking about?

01:57:33.954 --> 01:57:35.470
Two musketeers.
