00:05.273 --> 00:07.441
[Emily] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:07.475 --> 00:09.577
- I'm Leo Cruz.
- Damon.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.213
- Your boyfriend?
- We're not allowed to have
boyfriends.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.482
I know what's best for you.
Gotta trust me on this.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.450
Trust the man who
had an affair with my mom?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.219
I am going to China!

00:18.252 --> 00:20.588
The Committee decided
you girls didn't deserve
to go to China.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.157
- Why?
- They think we're a rogue gym.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.458
- Are we ready?
- We are.

00:24.492 --> 00:25.626
I love you, Mom.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.364
[rock music playing]

00:34.368 --> 00:37.405
Damon.
What are you doing here?

00:37.438 --> 00:40.074
Razor got another roadie gig
so they called me to fill in.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.342
I hope it's OK.
I need the money.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.145
To pay your legal fees?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.114
The charges were dropped.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.549
Hmm. Well, that's good.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.153
Yep, another hardened criminal
slips through the cracks.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.556
- I thought you were innocent.
- No, you thought I was a loser,

00:55.589 --> 00:57.591
just like all the men
your mother ever dated.

00:57.625 --> 01:01.162
Just another guy who breaks
his promises and disappears.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.097
Well, isn't that
exactly what you did?

01:04.532 --> 01:06.667
Oh, look, a special guest.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.471
Leo?
When did you get home?

01:10.504 --> 01:13.541
A few days ago. I have
a break between quarters.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.410
I was supposed to go to Africa
to work on a water project,

01:16.444 --> 01:18.479
but my family
needs me right now.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.649
- Yeah, Kaylie told me
your dad moved out.
- Yeah.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.492
Hey. You hungry?
Want me to make you some dinner?

01:31.525 --> 01:35.363
- You don't have to do this.
- What?

01:35.396 --> 01:37.631
Act like you're campaigning
for mother of the year.

01:37.665 --> 01:41.435
Oh, I'm not campaigning.

01:41.469 --> 01:45.539
I feel like my write-in support
is gonna clinch it for me.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.441
Do you think this is funny?

01:47.475 --> 01:51.412
You committed adultery and our
whole family is falling apart.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.615
We're not falling apart. Your
father just needs some time.

01:54.648 --> 01:58.519
It's been a month. And all
I've gotten from him are
a few e-mails.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.521
- He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.891
You're the light of his life.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.461
He's just... embarrassed.

02:07.495 --> 02:12.366
It's my fault. I should have
told him about you and Marty.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.604
Nothing about this is
your fault. Listen to me.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.540
Your father loves you
more than his pride.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.475
Nothing is ever
gonna change that.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.312
Are you out of love with Dad?

02:24.345 --> 02:29.750
- I still love your father.
- Does he still love you?

02:31.952 --> 02:37.591
- I hope so.
- But that doesn't mean
he can forgive you.

02:37.625 --> 02:42.596
No. No, it doesn't.

02:43.731 --> 02:47.601
- So what brings you by?
- Pizza.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.503
How about a large ham
and pineapple to go?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.472
We deliver, you know.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.174
I know, but then I wouldn't
have gotten to see Emily.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.248
Wow. Platinum.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.316
- You're a student, right?
- That's right.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.222
I don't think your
boyfriend likes me.

03:08.256 --> 03:11.992
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Oh. I thought at Nationals...

03:12.025 --> 03:14.762
Yeah, well, a lot's
happened since then.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.565
Kaylie told me what's going
on with the National Team.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.667
You guys were robbed.
How are you doing?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.535
Not great.

03:21.569 --> 03:25.606
Sasha says not going to China
basically ends our Olympic
hopes.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.275
Isn't there
anything he can do?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.410
I don't know what.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.446
But it hasn't stopped him from
working us harder than ever.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.384
Good. He's not
letting you give up.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.653
It seems like nothing's turned
out the way it was supposed to.

03:39.687 --> 03:43.391
I mean, ever since Payson
broke her back at Nationals...

03:43.424 --> 03:44.758
I heard the surgery
was pretty gnarly.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.627
Is she gonna ever
compete again?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.699
Come on, all the way through!
Keep pushing!

03:56.704 --> 03:58.539
Don't stop!

03:58.572 --> 04:00.808
Kaylie Cruz, 6:10.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.277
Emily Kmetko, 6:12.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.413
Sarah Columbo, 6:17.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.481
Kristin Banta, 6:20.

04:07.515 --> 04:11.051
That's good, ladies.
But not good enough.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.486
Do it again.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.555
We just did it five times.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.557
You know what was
great about Payson?

04:16.590 --> 04:19.360
She never complained,
never said, "I can't do it."

04:38.546 --> 04:41.549
Payson Keeler, 7:15.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.317
You shaved a whole
minute off your time.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.618
I can do better.
I'm going again.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.589
[sighing] She's back.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.459
Now that is the
attitude of a champion.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.327
Why are you
working us so hard?

04:53.361 --> 04:55.596
Are you punishing us because
we didn't go to China?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.466
No, I'm not working your tails
off because you didn't go to
China.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.534
I'm working them off because
China is coming here.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.639
To The Rock.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.636
So, how crazy is it that
the Chinese national team

05:35.669 --> 05:37.671
is coming to The Rock
for an invitational?

05:37.705 --> 05:40.908
- Pretty crazy.
- I wonder how the hell Sasha
pulled that off.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.710
What's so hard to believe?

05:42.743 --> 05:44.578
The National Team is competing
against China

05:44.612 --> 05:46.380
without the
National Champion.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.782
If the Chinese win, it's not
like they beat the best.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.619
- You sound pretty confident.
- I am.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.555
I'm training harder than ever
and I've increased my DOD's.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.658
I should be in China.
So should Emily.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.527
And when we beat them here
at The Rock,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.662
the National Committee won't be
able to play politics anymore.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.932
Must be hard to do with
everything going on at home.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.635
At least the drama's
not here at the gym, for once.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.637
Look, I don't want
to be a distraction.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.840
I know you can't forgive me,
and I've moved on.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.977
But if you ever need to talk
to a friend, I'm here.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.621
OK, Emily. If you can do
a Yurchenko full twist,

06:27.655 --> 06:29.757
you can do a one and a half.
Let's see it.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.606
[grunting]

06:45.639 --> 06:47.775
I thought you got over
your fear. What's the problem?

06:47.808 --> 06:50.844
All we're adding here is an
extra half twist and a blind
landing.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.647
I don't know. My body
just doesn't want to do it.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.550
The mind controls the body,
Emily. Your mind isn't letting
you do it

06:56.584 --> 06:59.587
and you need to figure out why
because if you don't increase
your DOD on every apparatus,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.689
China will crush us.

07:01.722 --> 07:05.693
I know you can do this move.
If you don't step up,

07:05.726 --> 07:07.628
you're gonna let
the whole team down.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.901
Hey. Don't worry about it.
You'll get it.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.703
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.639
You don't have to compete
against China at the
invitational.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.240
I wish I could.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.710
I can't wait to
start training again.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.244
When do you think that'll be?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.480
Dr. Clijster said I could
start in about a month

07:26.514 --> 07:29.517
but my physical therapist
still hasn't given me
the go-ahead.

07:29.550 --> 07:33.754
- Well, better safe than sorry.
- I just can't stand wondering.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.889
Will I be able to do
everything I used to?

07:35.923 --> 07:38.258
I'm sure you'll be as good
as you ever were.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.494
I didn't go through
this surgery for nothing.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.563
I'm gonna be better
than I ever was.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.768
- You have a lovely home,
Mrs. Keeler.
- Thank you.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.770
It'll show beautifully.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.972
But you know, the market
is really tough right now.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.743
If you don't mind me asking,
is there any reason you have
to sell?

07:55.776 --> 08:01.048
Our daughter just had back
surgery and we're looking at
some pretty major medical bills

08:01.081 --> 08:04.852
that our insurance didn't cover
because it wasn't considered
essential.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.755
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.724
Well, you might get enough
to pay your loan off

08:10.758 --> 08:13.627
but I'm afraid you'll
lose the 20% you put down
on the house.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.328
- Really?
- Well, it could be worse.

08:15.362 --> 08:18.699
At least you didn't take a
second out. If you can just
hang on a few more years...

08:18.732 --> 08:21.969
A few more years.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.305
We don't have the exact dates
but Sasha says we're talking
two or three weeks.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.674
That doesn't give us much time.

08:26.707 --> 08:31.645
How did Sasha get China
to come to The Rock for
a little club meet?

08:31.679 --> 08:35.816
Well, you know Sasha, he could
sell ice to an Eskimo.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.618
And I'm assuming
he knows their coach.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.086
How much do we need to raise?

08:39.119 --> 08:42.856
Roughly $30,000 to fly
the Chinese to Boulder,

08:42.890 --> 08:45.659
provide transportation,
food and lodging.

08:45.693 --> 08:49.730
Whoa, wait a minute. Why do
we have to pay their airfare?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.899
Isn't China the richest
country in the world?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.601
[groaning]

08:53.634 --> 08:55.302
What?
They practically own America.

08:55.335 --> 08:59.640
They're coming a long way
and Sasha feels it's incumbent
upon us to foot the bill.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.775
Plus there will be a lot
of press to accommodate.

09:01.809 --> 09:06.747
Sorry I'm late. I had...
an appointment.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.982
That's OK,
we're just talking money.

09:09.016 --> 09:13.053
The Rock has a surplus of
$10,000, so we need to raise
the other twenty.

09:13.086 --> 09:18.826
Wow. $20,000 to bring the
Chinese here? Is it worth it?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.995
Lauren's the only girl
from The Rock the National
Committee took to China.

09:22.029 --> 09:26.066
Sasha believes
that certain events

09:26.099 --> 09:28.836
prejudiced the other girls...

09:28.869 --> 09:31.672
Well, is it wise to go over
the National Committee's heads?

09:31.705 --> 09:33.340
We don't have a choice.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.610
Kaylie's the National Champion
and they're treating her like
a rookie.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.045
And Emily, let's not forget.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.047
I just think
we should be careful

09:40.080 --> 09:43.651
before we go alienating
the entire gymnastics community.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.920
Well, that's easy for you
to say. Payson's career
isn't in jeopardy.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.790
Payson doesn't even
have a career right now.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.625
But she will.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.861
And you don't want to piss
anybody off, isn't that it?

09:53.894 --> 09:57.965
Excuse me for saying this,
but certain events
had nothing to do with us.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.968
You can just say
my affair with Marty.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.638
Because the whole world knows.
And yes, I told my husband.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.406
And yes, he moved out.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.843
And so, you can all stop
whispering behind my back.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.719
So. Fund-raising ideas?

10:18.752 --> 10:21.689
We're $50,000
in debt, Mark.

10:21.722 --> 10:25.058
And Payson's physical therapy
is costing a fortune.

10:25.092 --> 10:29.797
And I still can't help thinking,
what if she still can't do
gymnastics again?

10:29.830 --> 10:33.233
She'll be devastated
and we'll be broke.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.940
- Any stiffness, pain?
- No.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.043
I feel as loose as Paris Hilton.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.746
I'm kidding, of course.
I feel great.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.948
So when can I start training?

10:47.981 --> 10:53.420
Well, I don't know,
how about... tomorrow?

10:53.453 --> 10:55.956
Really? Tomorrow?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.457
I want you to
take it easy, though.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.760
"A" level skills
for the first week.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.697
- Wow. This is really it.
- Yep.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.800
Time to show
just what you can do.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.169
But remember, you won't
be the gymnast you were.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.704
Not at first.

11:10.738 --> 11:15.776
So measure
your expectations. OK?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.945
- OK.
- [thunder rumbling]

11:17.978 --> 11:21.715
She's so excited about
gymnastics, I don't want
to ruin that for her.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.718
Oh, here comes Payson.
I better go.

11:24.752 --> 11:28.756
I love you, too.
Bye.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.724
- Hey!
- Hi.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.193
So? What did he say?
When can you start training?

11:33.226 --> 11:36.764
- He said I'm not ready yet.
- Well, you will be.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.700
You just have to be patient.
Patient!

11:42.302 --> 11:45.472
- Who were you
on the phone with?
- Oh, just your dad.

11:45.505 --> 11:49.009
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's great.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.211
[engine revving]

11:58.819 --> 12:00.988
So, how does bingo grab you?

12:01.021 --> 12:03.791
Right up there with
shuffleboard and lawn bowling.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.995
I'll have you know I once won
$1,500 at my church's bingo
bonanza.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.763
[grunting] A high roller.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.531
Anything else
I don't know about you?

12:11.564 --> 12:17.304
- I'm a spy.
- A spy? For who?

12:17.337 --> 12:20.841
I'd tell you but
then I'd have to kill you.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.511
- Sounds dangerous.
- I'm not afraid of a little
danger.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.779
Yeah?

12:27.147 --> 12:31.819
So, anyway, the goal
is to sell 500 tickets.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.522
There'll also be prizes
and auction items donated

12:35.555 --> 12:37.825
and the final game of the night
will be the big cash jackpot.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.861
Half the proceeds will go to
the winner and the other half
to The Rock.

12:40.894 --> 12:41.728
What do you think?

12:41.761 --> 12:45.098
I think you're cute
when you're excited.

12:45.132 --> 12:49.336
Of course, it would be helpful
to know exactly when the Chinese
are coming.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.172
- Do you have any idea?
- Not exactly.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.907
When do you think you will?

12:53.941 --> 12:56.543
Shortly after I invite them,
I imagine.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.946
What?
You haven't invited them?

12:58.979 --> 13:02.282
- No.
- You told everyone they
were coming!

13:02.315 --> 13:04.985
- And they will.
- How do you know?

13:05.018 --> 13:07.087
Because I know them.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.655
After they've beaten
the US National Team

13:08.688 --> 13:12.359
without the US National Champion
they'll feel obligated to defend
their victory.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.095
- But what if the US wins?
- The odds are against them.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.596
These girls trust you.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.331
You're the only person
in this sport

13:18.365 --> 13:20.100
they think they
can trust right now.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.369
And you're rolling the dice
on their careers?

13:22.402 --> 13:25.105
Look, I've studied hours
of footage of the Chinese Team

13:25.138 --> 13:28.108
and the six girls the US have
taken to China can't beat them.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.845
And in the meantime, what am
I supposed to tell everyone?

13:31.879 --> 13:34.848
Tell them...
Tell them whatever you like.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.618
I hope you're
right about this.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.055
Because the girls aren't
the only ones with something
to lose.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.924
Your reputation as a coach,

13:43.957 --> 13:46.426
and The Rock as a gym,
are all on the line.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.642
[sighing]
I can't do anything right.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.012
And I thought
I was hard on myself.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.414
You want to talk about it?

14:07.447 --> 14:10.183
It's just Sasha is adding
a degree of difficulty
to my vault.

14:10.217 --> 14:14.121
He says if I don't nail it,
China's gonna sweep the floor
with us.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.123
And I just can't do it.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.424
So, tell him to
give you something else.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.059
It doesn't work that way.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.895
The fact that China is
coming to The Rock is huge.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.231
And I can't just walk away
from a big opportunity

14:24.264 --> 14:26.433
and do gymnastics
my own way.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.102
I made a promise
to my team and myself

14:29.136 --> 14:32.172
that I would go for it
and I won't let them down.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.908
Ah. Nice shot.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.211
Damon.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.014
Hey, Emily.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.250
What are you
guys doing here?

14:43.283 --> 14:46.186
My mom's in charge of the
decorations for the China
fund-raiser.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.688
They're having it here?
Whose idea was that?

14:48.721 --> 14:52.325
Hey! Hi, Emily!

14:52.359 --> 14:54.294
Sorry I'm late.
Have you been here long?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.495
Too long.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.131
Barely a minute.

14:58.165 --> 15:01.434
So, what do you think?
It's perfect, isn't it?

15:01.468 --> 15:04.938
It's a little...
working class.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.008
And bingo is
a working man's game.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.943
Whatever you say.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.412
What was she thinking?
Now everybody's gonna know

15:12.445 --> 15:14.481
I work here and Sasha's
gonna find out I have a job.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.716
Relax. We're all gonna
be working the fund-raiser

15:16.749 --> 15:19.486
so Sasha's not gonna know
that you work here for real.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.388
Well, now your mother knows.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.291
- Hey, girls.
- And Mrs. Keeler.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.994
Who knows who else is gonna
walk through that door.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.264
[Summer] Hi, girls!

15:31.298 --> 15:32.265
- [Kaylie] Hey.
- [Payson] Hey.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.700
Isn't this exciting?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.002
China's coming to The Rock.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.270
Yeah! It sure is.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.507
Oh, the mothers are here.
Excuse me.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.512
Here.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.291
Thank you.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.463
What if your mothers
tell Summer and she tells Sasha?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.265
I told my mom not to tell.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.768
And we all know how good
she is at keeping secrets.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.538
Kaylie already told them all
when she ran away to gym camp.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.474
Payson never said
anything to me.

16:14.507 --> 16:18.011
Because teenage girls
keep each other's secrets.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.412
Unlike certain adults.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.015
Who told Sasha about
Carter and Kaylie.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.751
All I told him was that Carter
was dating one of the girls.

16:24.784 --> 16:29.089
- I didn't say who.
- And by the way, who told
Sasha about me and Marty?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.091
I did.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.427
- [gasping]
- Have you ever kept
a secret in your life?

16:34.461 --> 16:38.265
I only told him because he was
blaming Kaylie for not getting
along with Marty.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.568
Next time you might consider
keeping your mouth shut.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.203
Or your legs.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.307
Water under the bridge.
Let's get back to business.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.009
All right! Full steam ahead!
Toot, toot!

16:56.249 --> 16:59.086
- What up, college boy?
- Not much, pizza boy.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.553
[both chuckling]

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
Guy's gotta make a living.
We can't all be on scholarship.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.560
You have a scholarship?

17:07.594 --> 17:10.230
They don't just give
scholarships for financial need.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.566
They also give them
to geniuses like my brother.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.434
I'm not a genius.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.270
- He got a perfect SAT score.
- Wow.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.472
One Einstein special.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.508
Hold the E equals MC squared.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.610
Would you like
some Mensa with that?

17:23.643 --> 17:27.614
- No thanks, I'm good.
- All right. Well, enjoy.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.616
OK.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.286
I better get back to work.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.123
That dude's got
some serious attitude.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.125
He's cool.
Can I get you a salad?

17:38.158 --> 17:41.528
No croutons, peppers,
mushrooms or olives?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.298
Sure.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.135
- Dressing...
- On the side. I remember.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.638
- Hey!
- What's up?

17:51.671 --> 17:55.508
So, Payson, did the physical
therapist say anything today

17:55.542 --> 17:57.177
about when you
can start training?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.579
Nope. Your title is
safe for the time being.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.381
Oh, and who's
gonna take it from me?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.517
You're lookin' at her.
Next year.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.619
Yeah, well, you're
welcome to second place.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.523
If you ever get your lazy ass
back up on the bars again.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.628
I'm gonna check out the jukebox.
Any requests?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.664
No, thanks.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.508
It's obvious you
still like him.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.510
I can't just turn off
my feelings.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.412
Why do you have to?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.582
Easy for you to say.
He didn't cheat on you.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.322
May I help you, ma'am?

18:42.355 --> 18:44.557
Why are you being
such a jerk to Leo?

18:44.591 --> 18:47.627
- The guy's totally into you.
- He is not.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.529
And why do you even care?

18:49.562 --> 18:52.299
You've made it clear you can't
be with me until you're a rock
star.

18:52.332 --> 18:56.169
I know you don't understand
this, but I can't feel good
being with you

18:56.203 --> 18:57.670
if I don't feel
good about myself.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.440
You're a lot like Dad.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.542
You're proud and you can't
tolerate weakness in others

19:02.575 --> 19:04.477
because you can't
tolerate it in yourself.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.479
What's that supposed to mean?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.348
You've been
pretty hard on Mom.

19:08.381 --> 19:12.685
- She ruined our lives.
- And she feels terrible
about it.

19:12.719 --> 19:16.589
You're not the
only one suffering.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.359
So you think we should
just forgive her?

19:19.392 --> 19:22.229
I think people make mistakes.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.330
And they're
gonna disappoint you,

19:23.363 --> 19:26.933
especially the people who
love you the most. Like Mom.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.601
And Carter.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.404
And if you can't forgive
them for not being perfect,

19:31.438 --> 19:33.573
you're gonna end up alone.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.310
You're a star, Emily.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.547
You've been reaching for one
of the most impossible goals
a human could pick

19:40.580 --> 19:41.914
since you were a little girl.

19:41.948 --> 19:46.386
Would you really be into a guy
who was satisfied delivering
pizza? No.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.521
You don't have to be that guy.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.623
You had a chance
to sell your songs!

19:50.657 --> 19:53.526
We made a pact in L.A.
to follow our dreams,

19:53.560 --> 19:56.296
not sell them out
to the highest bidder.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.467
Yeah, I walked away from a lot
of money to do my music my way.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.637
And I know you say you don't
get to do your own thing in
gymnastics, but look at you.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.473
You're doing it your way.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.275
You're not supposed to work
but you have a job.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.677
You're not supposed to have
a boyfriend but here we are.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.781
Whatever we are.

20:14.814 --> 20:18.518
If you're so
married to the rules,

20:18.551 --> 20:23.523
then why are you hiding your
Pizza Shack uniform under
another guy's jacket?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.442
Good morning.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.480
You do know it's customary
if somebody says "good morning"

20:47.514 --> 20:48.848
to say "good morning" back.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.252
Maybe nod...

20:55.755 --> 20:57.390
...blink an eye, perhaps?

20:57.424 --> 21:00.560
I'm not in the mood for your
witty repartee this morning.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.495
OK.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.603
Last night I had to meet
The Rock mothers at the
location for the fund-raiser

21:10.637 --> 21:14.407
for the invitational that
I allowed them to believe
was definitely happening.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.577
You may be OK
with lying but I'm not.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.447
- I don't consider this a lie.
- I know you don't.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.649
You have your own
unique value system.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.552
But I answer to God.

21:25.585 --> 21:29.055
I didn't ask you to lead
anyone into believing anything.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.591
The point is,
I can't do this.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.859
Are you talking
about the job?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.694
Or what's going on between us?

21:35.895 --> 21:39.499
- There's nothing going on.
- Who's lying now?

21:41.401 --> 21:46.105
After the invitational,
if there is an invitational...

21:46.138 --> 21:49.542
...I think I should move on.

21:49.576 --> 21:53.746
Now that Payson's training again
I'm sure Kim would like her
job back.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.883
There will be an invitational.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.386
If the US Team
loses in Beijing.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.788
In fact, the meet is on now,
isn't it?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.891
- Mm-hmm.
- I know you're pretty confident
of the outcome,

22:04.924 --> 22:07.794
but do you mind if I check
to see who's winning?

22:09.896 --> 22:12.799
[male announcer] She's 13
and already a revelation.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.503
Look for her to lead
China to gold in 2012.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.371
[female announcer]
They need her right now.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.907
With the US National Team
leading China.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.376
[male announcer] The Americans
had a great first rotation.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.646
If they keep this up,
we could be looking at
one of the biggest upsets

22:26.679 --> 22:28.615
in gymnastics history.

22:28.648 --> 22:31.584
No one predicted the
US could win this thing.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.920
I can't believe he didn't
let us watch the meet.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.623
He's been up there all day.
It has to be over by now.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.857
I can't stand this.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.661
Summer!
Do you know if China won?

22:41.694 --> 22:45.898
I couldn't watch. But the last
I heard, the US was ahead.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.936
If the US won that'll put
even more pressure on us
when China comes to The Rock.

22:53.973 --> 22:57.376
Sasha! Who won?

22:57.877 --> 22:58.911
[Sasha] Um...

22:58.945 --> 23:00.947
Look, I...

23:00.980 --> 23:02.849
I owe you all an apology.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.818
I led you to believe that
China had already accepted
our invitation

23:05.852 --> 23:09.556
to come to The Rock,
when the truth is,
I hadn't invited them yet.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.890
You said they were coming.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.459
Because I absolutely
believed they would.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.694
If China beat the US.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.668
Which they did.
Decisively.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.737
The US team gave them a good
first round, but then they
got killed.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.806
- [girls chuckling] Yes!
- All right.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.742
Now the pressure is really on.
You think I've been pushing
you hard up to now,

23:29.776 --> 23:30.877
you ain't
seen nothin' yet.

23:30.910 --> 23:35.882
So go home, sleep, and be back
here at 6:00 AM tomorrow.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.851
You guys want to come over?

23:38.885 --> 23:43.189
I recorded the meet to see
exactly what we have to do
to massacre China.

23:43.222 --> 23:46.793
If China decimated the US Team,
I'll be happy if we can just eke
out a victory.

23:46.826 --> 23:51.598
We can also watch the Winter
Olympics, too. I have every
second of it recorded.

23:51.631 --> 23:57.470
This is the first time, watching
the Olympics, I've actually
thought, "Wow, I have a shot."

23:57.504 --> 24:01.908
That could be me competing in
2012 against people from all
over the world.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.645
- It will be you, Emily.
- It'll be all three of us.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.714
I wonder how Lauren
did in China?

24:07.747 --> 24:08.981
It sounds like
they all went down.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.551
She'll get another shot
when they come here.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.653
If they come here.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.921
It's not for sure, remember?

24:14.954 --> 24:17.757
Sasha has never
let us down before.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.560
If he says they're coming,
I believe him.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.794
Me, too.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.934
- Me, three.
- [girls chuckling]

24:27.967 --> 24:29.936
I am here today to apologize

24:29.969 --> 24:31.904
to the Chinese National
Gymnastics Team,

24:31.938 --> 24:36.876
to their esteemed coach,
Kai-Yung Tseng, and to
the great Republic of China.

24:36.909 --> 24:40.847
Did you know that Sasha hadn't
even invited the Chinese yet?

24:42.081 --> 24:43.883
No, not at first.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.919
I know this is Sasha's style
to roll the dice,

24:46.953 --> 24:49.556
but frankly I'm surprised
you'd go along with him.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.927
We know the whole Republic
of China is feeling this shame.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.897
I would like to help
Coach Tseng save face

24:57.930 --> 25:00.833
by inviting his team here,
to The Rock,

25:00.867 --> 25:03.770
to compete against
the real American Dream Team.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.814
Hey, Carter!

25:14.847 --> 25:16.883
Look, I made these.
Aren't they cute?

25:16.916 --> 25:19.586
Can you put one on each table?
Thanks, hon.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.823
No, no. What are those?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.091
Centerpieces?

25:25.124 --> 25:27.794
They're hideous.
Get rid of them. Use these.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.766
Oh! You know, it's
a little off-center.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.936
I got it.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.606
- Thanks, man.
- No worries.

25:41.908 --> 25:46.679
Hey. Thanks for
playing nice with Leo.

25:46.713 --> 25:50.717
He's a nice guy. I can't blame
him for being into you.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.686
Look, I thought about
what you said last night.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.724
And I would never want you
to sell your dreams to
the highest bidder.

25:57.757 --> 26:01.861
I just... I am fighting for
my gymnastics life right now.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.064
I need to be around people
who I can trust will be there.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.967
Who won't suddenly
drop out or disappear.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.037
- You can trust me.
- I want to.

26:12.672 --> 26:17.910
But...
I ran after you. Literally.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.047
I opened my heart and that is
really hard for me to do.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.148
Yeah, me, too.

26:23.415 --> 26:27.086
And I'm so sorry
I let you down.

26:27.119 --> 26:29.822
And I know you don't need
any more drama right now.

26:29.856 --> 26:33.693
But I'll be here to support you
and your dream every step of
the way.

26:33.726 --> 26:36.395
Just don't...

26:36.428 --> 26:38.798
Just don't give up on me.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.975
So, you sure it's over
between you and Damon?

26:50.943 --> 26:53.880
I don't know. Everything
just got all messed up.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.915
- We just keep...
- Pushing each other away?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.951
What's that all about?

27:01.688 --> 27:05.658
- You tell me.
- What does that mean?

27:05.692 --> 27:10.062
You and Carter. You push him
away, then bring him back

27:10.096 --> 27:13.065
just to push him away again.

27:13.099 --> 27:16.869
Do you ever wonder if
all this time we spend
trying to be perfect

27:16.903 --> 27:20.639
really just screws up
our relationships?

27:27.246 --> 27:29.148
Why is there a "For Sale" sign
in front of the house?

27:29.181 --> 27:33.119
[sighing] I told them
we didn't want a sign.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.956
Are we selling the house?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.060
- We're testing the waters.
- Why?

27:41.093 --> 27:42.895
We aren't moving
back to Minnesota...

27:42.929 --> 27:47.133
No, no. Sit down.
We need to talk.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.178
Hey, Emily?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.881
Um, I need a job.
Do you know if they're hiring?

28:01.914 --> 28:03.449
Why do you need a job?

28:03.482 --> 28:06.452
I just found out the insurance
didn't pay for my surgery

28:06.485 --> 28:09.255
so my parents
are in some serious debt.

28:09.288 --> 28:13.292
- How serious?
- They're selling the house.

28:15.161 --> 28:20.967
Hey, Pay, I've made
a lot of endorsement money...

28:21.000 --> 28:23.970
No, thank you. We can't
take your money.

28:24.003 --> 28:27.940
I just wish my parents had let
me take the sponsorship money
when I was the best.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.911
Then we wouldn't
be in this mess.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.015
What's wrong?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.751
The Keelers need money
for Payson's medical bills.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.086
They might lose their house.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.889
I offered to loan
her some money, but...

28:42.922 --> 28:46.926
If they won't borrow it,
what if they win it?

28:48.060 --> 28:50.029
What do you mean?

28:50.062 --> 28:52.965
Someone has to win
the big jackpot.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.035
Are you talking about cheating?

28:56.068 --> 28:59.038
You call it cheating,
I call it charity.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.015
It's time for the fund-raiser.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.983
- Are you coming?
- Maybe later.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.021
Nothing from the Chinese?

29:19.125 --> 29:21.994
Maybe you were right.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.930
The girls trusted me.
What if I can't deliver?

29:23.963 --> 29:25.297
Who will they believe in?

29:26.966 --> 29:30.202
They'll believe in the person
who believes in them most.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.538
And that's you.

29:32.571 --> 29:37.276
- I was so sure this would work.
- Don't lose faith then.

29:37.309 --> 29:41.080
And you know, sometimes it
doesn't hurt to say a prayer.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.115
Will you say one?

29:45.317 --> 29:48.988
- For the girls?
- I already have.

29:49.021 --> 29:52.258
For the girls.
And for you.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.997
[sighing]

30:05.204 --> 30:07.106
[pop music playing]

30:18.284 --> 30:21.253
Be mine. Be square.
Be cool? No-sir-ree!

30:21.287 --> 30:23.022
B-3!

30:24.623 --> 30:26.859
- This is a great turnout!
- Yeah.

30:26.893 --> 30:28.194
It's been packed all night.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.630
I just hope this
isn't all for nothing.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.633
- Still no word from China?
- Not yet.

30:34.666 --> 30:39.038
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.075
I've been so stressed out.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.111
No, you were right.

30:45.144 --> 30:49.415
I betrayed my values
and I won't do it again.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.150
Can I ask you
a personal question?

30:51.183 --> 30:55.287
Is there something
going on between you and Sasha?

30:55.321 --> 30:56.923
Like, personally?

30:58.657 --> 31:02.161
- [chuckling]
- He's a very attractive man...

31:02.194 --> 31:05.097
...but we don't share
the same beliefs.

31:06.332 --> 31:10.236
- Like abstinence?
- For one.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.305
But I also think it would
be strange for Lauren.

31:13.339 --> 31:16.442
- You're not her mother.
- Still.

31:16.475 --> 31:21.981
It's ironic. You're the only one
technically allowed to sleep
with the coach and...

31:23.049 --> 31:26.385
- B-11! Chicken legs!
- Bingo! I have bingo!

31:26.418 --> 31:30.089
- [crowd groaning]
- I never understood why people
get so excited

31:30.122 --> 31:31.958
over this silly game.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.195
- He has bingo!
- Whoo!

31:36.228 --> 31:38.998
All right! Well, sir...

31:39.031 --> 31:44.203
You have won a French manicure
and pedicure, compliments of me!

31:44.236 --> 31:48.107
- [crowd laughing]
- Congratulations!

31:48.140 --> 31:52.945
All right, folks, it's time
for the really big jackpot.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.413
The kids are
handing out the cards now

31:54.446 --> 31:58.050
and I'm pleased to announce
that the jackpot...

31:58.084 --> 32:00.987
...is over $20,000!

32:01.020 --> 32:02.121
- [crowd cheering]
- Give it up!

32:02.154 --> 32:06.058
Whoo! Half goes to the winner
and half goes to The Rock

32:06.092 --> 32:08.227
to help us bring
the Chinese to Boulder!

32:08.260 --> 32:09.395
Let's get started!

32:09.428 --> 32:11.297
Uh, Mrs. Keeler?

32:11.330 --> 32:13.966
Oh, no thanks, Kaylie.
I'm not a big bingo fan.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.235
But it's for The Rock.
Everyone has to play!

32:16.268 --> 32:19.071
- I'll pass.
- No, you can't pass!

32:19.105 --> 32:21.040
OK.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.175
- You're strong, aren't ya?
- Here you go.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.510
Thank you.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.047
And... good luck!

32:29.448 --> 32:31.717
- Hey, I need more cards.
- Here.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.121
- Is everything OK?
- Fine. Go! Go.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.488
OK...

32:39.158 --> 32:42.094
OK, did you make sure
everyone knows the Keelers
are going to win?

32:42.128 --> 32:46.332
Yeah, everyone but the Keelers,
and they're all happy to help
them keep their house.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.201
Great. I gave your mother the
numbers on Mrs. Keeler's card.

32:49.235 --> 32:53.139
All we have to do
is act surprised.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.274
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.109
But I never win anything.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.311
Well, you never know, maybe
tonight's your lucky night.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.581
Somebody's gonna be "N"
the money with N-42.

33:07.186 --> 33:11.123
- Oh, look! You have N-42.
- Where?

33:11.157 --> 33:12.324
Right there.

33:12.358 --> 33:16.795
Oh! Well, that'll be the only
time this neon thingie...

33:16.828 --> 33:18.530
- Dauber, honey.
- Dauber...

33:18.564 --> 33:22.568
...the only time this
dauber will daub tonight.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.122
[phone ringing]

33:43.155 --> 33:46.058
[male operator] I have an
international call from China.

33:46.092 --> 33:50.096
[woman] Belov. This is Ellen
from the National Committee.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.164
We caught your
press conference today.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.899
What kind of idiot are you?

33:53.932 --> 33:58.070
This Committee is not about
to let the Chinese come to your
unapproved club meet.

33:58.104 --> 34:02.408
It's bad enough we got our
asses kicked here without you
calling the Chinese out.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.110
It's really not up to you.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.811
Oh, but it is.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.480
We had a long talk with their
coach. They don't want to piss
us off.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.083
Trust me, they won't be calling
to accept your challenge,

34:11.117 --> 34:13.585
and there will be consequences
for this little stunt, Belov.

34:13.619 --> 34:18.124
- Serious ones.
- [dial tone]

34:34.906 --> 34:37.676
[phone ringing]

34:51.890 --> 34:54.460
Ain't no jive.
It's I-25!

34:54.493 --> 34:59.331
- Oh, my gosh!
I got another one!
- Ooh!

34:59.365 --> 35:02.534
- This game is kind of fun.
- Not so silly when
you're winning, is it?

35:07.939 --> 35:10.509
Ah... All right!

35:10.542 --> 35:13.279
Here we go! Another ball!

35:17.716 --> 35:19.618
Uh, you know...

35:19.651 --> 35:22.554
I hope you're not in the
loo when I call B-2.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.490
Yeah, baby!

35:25.557 --> 35:27.559
I got your number, I got it!

35:27.593 --> 35:29.361
- All right! Yeah!
- Yeah!

35:29.395 --> 35:30.696
Whoo!

35:30.729 --> 35:33.399
- What is the prize again?
- $10,000!

35:33.432 --> 35:36.635
Wow! Come on, baby, come on!

35:36.668 --> 35:41.139
Gimme some G-love!
Gimme some G-love, come on!

35:41.673 --> 35:44.210
OK!

35:46.745 --> 35:51.317
- What has happened to my
mother?
- G-love! It's um...

35:51.350 --> 35:54.720
- G... G-75!
- Aw.

35:54.753 --> 36:00.426
- Oh, no, it's O-75. My bad!
- O-75? Yeah!

36:00.459 --> 36:02.628
- Wow!
- Oh, my God.

36:02.661 --> 36:06.765
- One more! Whoo-hoo!
- [all chuckling]

36:08.634 --> 36:11.203
- One more!
- OK, I...

36:11.237 --> 36:13.672
[mouthing]
I can't read the number.

36:13.705 --> 36:17.676
[whispering] I can't read
the number! I can't... Uh.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.645
OK, why don't I do
some thank you's right now!

36:19.678 --> 36:22.748
- To all you lovely people.
- Um, how you doing?

36:22.781 --> 36:27.753
- I'm great! I'm good.
- Good, do you need a refill?

36:27.786 --> 36:31.357
- No, I don't. I'm really good.
- Good.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.225
Jesus, we love you!
Thank you in heaven...

36:33.259 --> 36:35.994
...and earth, and...

36:36.027 --> 36:40.599
...and Marie Osmond, because
she is helping those women

36:40.632 --> 36:43.969
who fight and fluctuate daily,
you know?

36:44.002 --> 36:49.241
She's helping them fight
the fight! And for all those
darling dolls she makes.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.509
They're beautiful!

36:50.542 --> 36:52.311
All right! Now that
the thank you's are over,

36:52.344 --> 36:56.315
we're gonna pull
that next ball, yeah.

36:56.348 --> 37:00.452
G-love, G-love, G-love, baby!
G-love!

37:00.486 --> 37:02.721
It's nifty because
it's gonna be G-50!

37:02.754 --> 37:07.359
- Yeah! Bingo!
- [audience cheering]

37:07.393 --> 37:10.396
- Bingo!
- [applause, cheering]

37:15.667 --> 37:16.702
[sighing]

37:18.770 --> 37:20.839
We won! We won!

37:44.430 --> 37:46.432
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.434
We missed you
at the fund-raiser.

37:48.467 --> 37:52.671
- Yeah, how'd it go?
- It was a big success.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.740
We raised over
$10,000 for The Rock.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.842
And $10,000
for the Keelers.

37:56.875 --> 37:57.676
What?

37:57.709 --> 38:00.579
I'll tell you
all about it later.

38:00.612 --> 38:05.617
- Did you hear from China?
- Um, yeah.

38:07.353 --> 38:10.088
They accepted our invitation.
China's coming to The Rock.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.325
- Oh, my gosh! That's great!
- [laughing]

38:16.094 --> 38:18.630
I... I can't.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.789
The decorations looked
really nice tonight, Mom.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.757
Thank you, honey.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.125
It was a good night.

38:47.158 --> 38:51.430
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey! I totally forgot.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.799
I have something to show you!

38:55.867 --> 39:01.807
- Your first big magazine
article.
- Wow.

39:01.840 --> 39:06.144
I'm not perfect.
Far from it.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.615
- None of us are.
- I know.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.429
So, are you excited to beat
the crap out of China?

39:24.963 --> 39:27.833
- I guess I should be.
- Why aren't you?

39:27.866 --> 39:30.536
Sasha wants me to do a Yurchenko
one and a half twist on vault.

39:30.569 --> 39:35.907
- You can get that move.
- It's not the move.
It's the landing.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.511
You're coming down with your
head back so you can't see
the floor.

39:39.545 --> 39:40.812
Which can be scary.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.549
Flying blind's
not my specialty.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.817
It would be nice if we could
always see where we're going.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.854
Ah, gymnastics imitates life,
once again.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.823
OK, forget the metaphors.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.426
But I've done that move
and I can help you get it,
if you need me.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.597
You're a really sweet guy,
you know that?

40:11.910 --> 40:14.680
You know, I don't think
that's anything.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.617
No, it's something.

40:22.888 --> 40:25.891
It's a guy who has everything
together supporting an amazing
girl.

40:27.693 --> 40:31.863
- Where are you going?
- Recording studio.

40:31.897 --> 40:32.998
Because I'm gonna be that guy.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.877
I wish I had a camera.

40:45.911 --> 40:49.648
- I've washed a dish before.
- Exactly. A dish.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.887
- [laughing]
- Oh!

40:55.921 --> 40:59.758
You should not
have done that.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.628
- You wouldn't dare!
- Oh, but I would!

41:02.661 --> 41:03.929
No!

41:08.934 --> 41:11.937
- Truce?
- Truce.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.007
Come here.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.910
Hmm. This dish soap
really does cut the grease.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.879
Very funny.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.932
I know!

41:40.966 --> 41:44.670
$10,000!

41:44.703 --> 41:48.940
It only makes a dent in things
but maybe it's a sign our luck
is changing.

41:48.974 --> 41:53.979
Now if only Payson could
get the go-ahead to start
training again...

41:55.947 --> 41:59.117
I know. You're right.
We need to be patient.

42:00.719 --> 42:03.589
I love you, too. Bye.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.692
[beeping]

42:06.725 --> 42:09.928
Mrs. Keeler, this is August,
Payson's physical therapist.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.931
I haven't heard from Payson
and it's been a week since I
gave her the go-ahead

42:12.964 --> 42:14.633
to start training again.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.034
I just want to know
how it's going,

42:16.067 --> 42:19.705
if you could give me
a ring back. Thanks.
