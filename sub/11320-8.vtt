WEBVTT

00:49.257 --> 00:50.633
Where were you?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.261
I looked all over for you.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.096
Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.599
I lost my cell phone.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.852
Where's your head?
How could you lose your phone?

01:01.394 --> 01:02.896
Why are you so angry?

01:05.648 --> 01:06.816
You met with my dad, right?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.278
What did he say?
Tell me everything that happened.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.906
He said that the surgery is canceled.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.116
Was that all?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.411
What else matters?

01:20.371 --> 01:22.248
It may be the obvious result,

01:25.752 --> 01:27.462
but I'm sad regardless.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.550
We have no options.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.096
What do we do now?

01:40.058 --> 01:41.392
Let's talk inside.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.519
No.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.980
I'd like to be alone.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.691
It's already late.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.487
I'll talk to you when I've organized

01:53.446 --> 01:54.572
my thoughts.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.243
Anyway, Mr. Han,

01:58.827 --> 01:59.953
you hang in there too.

02:01.871 --> 02:02.997
Good night.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.191
You ran around looking for her all night.

03:13.860 --> 03:14.861
Sit down.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.414
Do you like her?

03:29.667 --> 03:31.252
Would you believe me if I said I did?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.671
Then why did you run after her
like a madman?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.715
People would think

03:36.299 --> 03:38.551
you're a devoted lover.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.720
Clearly, I could never be.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.388
I'm your son after all.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.308
I take after you, so all I can do
is use people and discard them.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.268
If that's what it means to like someone,

03:47.769 --> 03:50.313
then yes, I like her.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.651
I know you feel guilty,

03:54.984 --> 03:56.694
but don't take it out on me.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.240
You've committed a crime.
Don't give me attitude.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.078
How could you not ask even once
why I did it?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.454
It's obvious.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.665
You were played by your mom's antics.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.126
How could she beg her son just to extend

04:12.335 --> 04:13.836
her pathetic life a little?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.047
A son she didn't even raise at that.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.092
Dad.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.262
I'm still her son.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.390
Isn't that what family is?

04:26.140 --> 04:27.600
You take responsibility.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.145
Once you have a relationship,
you should take responsibility.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.190
Are you saying that for me to hear?

04:34.440 --> 04:37.026
Do you think you're qualified
to lecture me?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.028
You wanted to save your family,

04:39.279 --> 04:42.115
so you bought someone's organ
that's as precious as their life.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.908
Is that what you call responsibility?

04:45.743 --> 04:47.120
Divorce her right away.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.915
I'm guessing she must have
something big on you.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.792
Pay her off and divorce her.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.919
Let me know if you need someone
to get rid of her.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.088
Report to the head office
starting tomorrow.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.216
Drop the act
and move out of the restaurant loft.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.470
I'll just quit everything.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.099
Why are you sparing someone like me?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.768
I don't make money and only cause trouble.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.021
I'll just go to prison.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.189
Have me locked up.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.110
I'll get going now.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.056
Mom,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.475
why do you keep crying?

05:50.850 --> 05:51.976
I'm sorry.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.103
Why are you crying?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.981
Did you fight with Mister?

06:01.986 --> 06:03.488
No, that's not it.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.162
I just keep crying

06:12.246 --> 06:14.457
because I'm so stupid.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.171
I'm so stupid and pathetic,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.549
so the tears keep coming.

06:23.966 --> 06:27.303
What? You're so smart.

06:29.847 --> 06:30.973
Thanks.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.853
Hearing you say that gives me
so much strength.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.689
You're smart.
You're really smart and pretty.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.527
Eun-seong's mom is smart

06:43.027 --> 06:44.153
and pretty.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.155
That's it. Smile.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.741
You look prettier when you smile.

06:49.450 --> 06:50.493
I look pretty?

07:22.942 --> 07:27.864
ONLY EMPLOYEES ALLOWED

07:45.673 --> 07:47.258
Are you awake?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.262
Hello.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.599
What is it at this hour?

07:54.682 --> 07:56.934
The chairman would like to see you.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.066
What brings you here?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.652
Leave this place and die.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.907
Do you realize what you've done?

08:11.699 --> 08:14.035
If I were you,
I would've given up and died long ago.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.954
How could you be a leech all your life?

08:17.246 --> 08:18.915
Do you want to live that badly,

08:19.123 --> 08:21.375
even if it means sacrificing
someone else's life?

08:22.043 --> 08:23.503
You latched onto me when you were young,

08:23.586 --> 08:25.129
and then onto your son
now that you're old.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
Aren't you ashamed?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.343
I latched on to you?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.636
Of course, you did.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.304
You showed up pregnant.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.306
Are you claiming
you didn't latch on to me?

08:35.389 --> 08:36.891
Whose son was he?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.894
You said I was your one and only.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.855
You said you wanted to leave it all
and be with me.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.107
You're the one who said that.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.027
What can't you say

08:48.444 --> 08:49.987
when you like someone?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.656
Mr. Han Seong-guk.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.451
Let me ask you one thing.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.539
When you heard I was dying,

09:00.289 --> 09:01.415
how did you feel?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.335
Were you not sad at all?

09:06.128 --> 09:08.756
Everyone dies.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.426
I know...

09:14.971 --> 09:17.181
my life was full of flaws.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.310
I've sinned against your wife.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.897
I've sinned against our son.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.570
I've sinned against my parents.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.785
How could a life be so full of sin?

09:40.204 --> 09:41.330
Still...

09:42.582 --> 09:44.250
Still, Mr. Han Seong-guk,

09:46.127 --> 09:47.336
you know what?

09:49.213 --> 09:50.214
I...

09:53.467 --> 09:55.386
I survived this entire time

09:56.971 --> 09:59.348
because I had faith that you loved me.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.517
But if you say that,

10:02.852 --> 10:05.229
my life is too pathetic.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.775
I wasted my entire youth

10:10.318 --> 10:12.612
waiting for you to come to me.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.866
Couldn't you at least say

10:18.326 --> 10:20.328
that you're sad?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.413
I am sad.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.415
I'm sad,

10:25.166 --> 10:27.126
but what's sadder

10:28.461 --> 10:32.173
is an old mom holding back her young son
with a bright future ahead of him.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.425
What if Ji-hun goes

10:35.301 --> 10:36.594
to prison because of you?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.723
Do you know how much we lost
because his marriage deal fell through?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.392
Will you pay me back for that?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.231
I've told

10:50.107 --> 10:52.652
the hospital director
to take good care of you.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.112
In other words,

10:55.446 --> 10:57.615
don't be a leech to your son any longer.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.992
I'm sure you understand,

11:01.285 --> 11:02.411
so I'll get going now.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.705
Gosh, it reeks of alcohol.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.583
How much did he drink?

11:50.584 --> 11:51.669
Ji-hun.

11:52.795 --> 11:53.921
Han Ji-hun.

11:54.713 --> 11:55.714
Hey.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.135
Is he dead?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.344
Hey, Ji-hun.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.179
Ji-hun. Hey.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.056
Ji-hun.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.727
I thought you were dead.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.354
What are you doing here?

12:13.983 --> 12:14.984
Give me some water.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.152
Gosh.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.909
Here.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.371
It's so hot.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.336
I heard

12:34.795 --> 12:36.338
the surgery is off the table.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.549
The chairman called.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.676
He asked where you were,
so I said I didn't know.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.761
Good.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.347
Go.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.557
I'm going back to sleep.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.933
Gosh.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.479
Why did you drink so much?

12:53.063 --> 12:54.732
Did you drink this all by yourself?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.402
You should've called me to drink
with you. This is so expensive.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.196
When else would I get to drink this?

13:01.322 --> 13:02.448
Ho-jun.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.451
Why are you still my friend?

13:06.243 --> 13:07.786
Everyone calls me garbage.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.457
Hey.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.168
The world needs

13:15.336 --> 13:18.506
people to clean up the garbage too.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.010
You still have to work.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.471
Many people rely on you.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.598
They're not relying on me.
They're relying on my dad.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.768
I'm just a puppet.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.147
You're a competent person.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.398
Don't say that.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.567
Do you know why I'm still by your side?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.695
It's because you're competent.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.156
My dad always told me to stay

13:44.240 --> 13:45.783
with someone who's competent.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.369
I'm not competent.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.624
Back in high school

13:53.832 --> 13:57.169
when you used to eat and sleep
at my place all the time,

13:58.045 --> 14:00.172
my dad said

14:00.297 --> 14:02.424
that you're quite competent.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.843
When I asked him why,

14:05.803 --> 14:08.430
he said it was
because you ate three bowls of rice.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.808
Ho-jun.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.061
It's weird hearing you
say my name so tenderly.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.437
What?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.273
I have nothing.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.777
I always acted high and mighty,

14:24.363 --> 14:26.448
but I was in the palm of my dad's hand.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.578
I did start having feelings for her,

14:32.162 --> 14:34.373
but I can't trust myself.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.169
That's all I can do for her.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.715
Buying her liver with money.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.177
And that was my dad's money
when you think about it.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.305
How could you say that?

14:52.182 --> 14:54.476
That's your phone.
The chairman must be calling.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.061
Where's your phone?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.396
Where...

15:00.983 --> 15:02.985
It's your father.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.029
It's the chairman. Take it.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.739
It stopped ringing.

15:07.531 --> 15:10.784
I should've just... He's calling again.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.661
Gosh.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.540
DAD

15:27.426 --> 15:28.761
Gosh.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.767
DAD

15:41.941 --> 15:43.734
-Hello?
-Where are you?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.738
I'm preparing to go to the police

15:48.364 --> 15:49.406
to turn myself in.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.241
Get over here before I drag you out.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.003
Gosh.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.594
So you want to take this all the way?

16:11.512 --> 16:12.638
I've committed a crime,

16:13.180 --> 16:14.556
so I plan to pay the price.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.558
I like your tenacity.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.893
You really are my son.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.855
Pour me a drink.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.827
Fine.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.412
I'll let you

16:36.620 --> 16:37.788
have your way this time.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.544
But don't meet with your mom ever again.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.463
Erase her from your life.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.643
Also, get rid of that woman with the kid.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.229
Get a divorce immediately
after the surgery,

17:02.688 --> 17:05.941
and promise not to associate
with her ever again.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.571
You'll pay dearly
if you recklessly trust people like that.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.449
I have people doing
a background check on her.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.534
If word ever gets out,

17:15.784 --> 17:17.911
her life will be over.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.664
From now on,

17:20.789 --> 17:22.082
you must do

17:22.249 --> 17:23.834
everything I say.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.961
You're not an adolescent anymore.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.506
You've rebelled enough.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.300
Okay?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.887
Have a drink.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.021
Drink and pour me another.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.822
I heard you lost your cell phone.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.950
Mr. Han said to give this to you.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.080
It's provided by the company
for employees,

18:01.330 --> 18:02.956
so don't feel burdened by it.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.209
When you're in the hospital,

18:05.292 --> 18:07.544
you'll need to keep in touch
with Eun-seong.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.506
You'll need it.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.760
Actually,

18:15.761 --> 18:17.179
the surgery

18:17.763 --> 18:19.098
is back on.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.433
It will proceed as scheduled.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.269
How?

18:25.104 --> 18:28.524
I think the chairman gave in.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.779
What about Mr. Han?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.447
Where is he now?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.452
Ji-hun is...

18:40.953 --> 18:42.079
I mean,

18:42.621 --> 18:45.541
Mr. Han won't be coming by
that much anymore.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.710
The head office is super busy.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.943
The person you are trying
to reach cannot answer the phone.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.362
Please leave a message after the tone.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.758
How could you be a leech all your life?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.094
You latched onto me when you were young,

19:39.178 --> 19:40.846
and then onto your son
now that you're old.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.890
Aren't you ashamed?

19:45.559 --> 19:48.562
Ms. Oh, they said the surgery will go
as originally scheduled.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.855
Did you hear?

19:51.773 --> 19:52.858
What do you mean?

19:52.941 --> 19:54.776
That's what the nurse said.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.738
She said the doctor will be here soon.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.283
There must have been a clerical error.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.712
Am I invisible to you?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.216
I'm your mom.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.761
I'm sorry.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.179
For what?

20:22.804 --> 20:24.097
About Na-yoon?

20:25.015 --> 20:26.183
It isn't true.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.352
It was over with her years ago.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.271
So you're not together currently?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.564
No.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.234
Still, how could you do that
to your brother?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.278
Imagine how much it hurt his pride.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.447
You should've told him from the start.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.743
If it isn't about Na-yoon,

20:45.327 --> 20:46.453
what is it?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.457
What have you and your dad
been talking about in secret?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.920
Your brother and I feel
like total fools these days.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.797
Why?

20:57.214 --> 20:58.423
Is it about your mom?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.842
No.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.052
Of course it is.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.347
It's obviously about that woman.

21:07.641 --> 21:08.767
What does she want?

21:09.893 --> 21:11.019
Does she want money?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.021
Shall I meet with her?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.649
No, don't. It's not like that.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.901
I'll tell you later
when the time is right.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.945
So I should stay out of it?

21:20.862 --> 21:23.073
Yes, you stay out of it.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.701
Ji-hun, come to my room.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.327
Honey.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.249
Go here tomorrow.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.126
She's the person you'll marry.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.171
As soon as the divorce
is processed after the surgery,

21:38.505 --> 21:39.923
let's set a date for the engagement.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.425
What do you say?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.636
Okay.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.897
Mr. Han.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.422
INCOMING CALL
KANG HYE-SU

22:30.432 --> 22:31.641
You picked up.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.727
What is it?

22:34.144 --> 22:35.520
What happened?

22:36.104 --> 22:37.189
The surgery.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.982
What do you think happened?

22:39.441 --> 22:40.901
We're proceeding as planned.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.572
I'm driving. Let's talk later.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.327
Hello?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.704
Hello?

22:53.330 --> 22:54.748
Hello?

22:55.040 --> 22:57.584
Come in. Who hung up on you?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.299
Auntie bought this for me.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.219
Why do you look so down?

23:07.761 --> 23:08.762
What?

23:13.058 --> 23:14.768
Pack Eun-seong's clothes for me.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.854
Let me take things over little by little.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.108
Thanks, Ju-yeon.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.819
Did you eat? Do you want anything?

23:24.361 --> 23:26.488
Why don't you sit

23:27.155 --> 23:28.281
and rest?

23:29.199 --> 23:31.618
You worked all day long.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.412
Stop trying to serve me.

23:34.913 --> 23:35.914
Okay?

23:36.164 --> 23:37.624
Feed yourself.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.876
Don't worry about others.

23:41.419 --> 23:42.796
Am I wrong, Hye-su?

23:43.130 --> 23:45.006
Am I wrong?

23:45.173 --> 23:46.299
You're right.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.928
Eun-seong, what should we do with Mom?

23:53.723 --> 23:56.268
-Eun-seong, is that fun?
-Yes.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.019
Who bought this for you?

23:58.103 --> 23:59.229
Auntie.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.897
Then kiss me.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.777
-Are you giving her a skirt?
-No.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.945
No?

24:07.028 --> 24:10.782
It's weird to wear both a skirt
and a dress.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.541
What a pleasure to see you again.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.502
Are you still working?

24:23.503 --> 24:25.255
Wait a minute.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.842
Have you had dinner?

24:30.552 --> 24:34.181
People keep asking me that today.
It's overwhelming.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.516
You see,

24:36.933 --> 24:38.351
it's a bit uncomfortable,

24:38.435 --> 24:39.436
mister.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.272
Gosh. Why do you call me that?

24:42.564 --> 24:44.649
Do I look that old to you?

24:44.733 --> 24:46.484
Then shall I call you "Grandpa"?

24:46.860 --> 24:48.486
Does your wife know you do this?

24:49.863 --> 24:50.864
Oh my gosh.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.490
I am so hurt.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.826
I'm single. I live alone.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.036
What wife?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.495
"Grandpa"?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.080
Look at my skin.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.625
How do I look old? Goodness.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.296
-Oh, my.
-Everyone thinks I'm in college.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.423
I see.

25:08.506 --> 25:12.177
Would you like to grab
some chicken and beer?

25:12.594 --> 25:13.595
No.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.640
I need to go home.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.600
My family is very strict,

25:18.683 --> 25:20.310
so I get in trouble if I'm late.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.229
Good night, mister.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.605
What?

25:26.149 --> 25:27.275
"Mister"?

25:31.905 --> 25:33.114
How beautiful.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.455
She's waiting inside. This way, please.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.304
You...

25:56.554 --> 25:57.555
What?

25:57.806 --> 25:59.349
Aren't you here to see me?

26:06.189 --> 26:07.941
What an incredible old man.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.777
How much did you hear?

26:11.653 --> 26:12.779
What do you mean?

26:13.363 --> 26:16.032
He said you'd tell me everything.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.079
Why are you laughing?

26:21.204 --> 26:22.414
I can't help it.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.041
Our relationship is kind of funny,
isn't it?

26:25.583 --> 26:27.419
Yes, it's funny.

26:28.670 --> 26:30.380
I'm funny, and my dad is funny too.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.383
This is pure comedy.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.978
I put Na-yoon

26:45.312 --> 26:47.022
and Ji-hun back together.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.484
What did you just say?

26:52.235 --> 26:54.738
I'm going to have Ji-hun marry Na-yoon.

26:55.363 --> 26:56.489
You need to be understanding.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.743
They're not over each other yet,

27:00.160 --> 27:02.412
and it's right to let people
who like each other be together.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.205
-Dad.
-Honey.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.957
Have you lost your mind?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.250
What's the problem?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.711
It's not like we told anyone
about the wedding plans.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.963
And we can't cut off ties

27:12.213 --> 27:13.340
with that family.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.342
I've invested too much.

27:16.885 --> 27:17.886
Dad,

27:18.678 --> 27:20.305
you are too cruel.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.556
I'll find you

27:21.848 --> 27:23.058
someone nice soon.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.268
Forget her.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.353
No.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.730
I can't forget this.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.024
How could you do this?

27:31.107 --> 27:32.734
How could you do this to me?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.569
What did Ji-hun ever do for you?

27:34.652 --> 27:37.322
While he got into fights
and ran away from home,

27:37.405 --> 27:40.241
all I did was work hard under you.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.326
I did my best.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.370
Doing your best doesn't matter.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.996
What matters is doing things right.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.373
Dad!

27:46.581 --> 27:48.708
Every department is full of complaints
about you.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.420
Don't just show off.
Focus on doing your work right.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.590
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.468
Dad!

28:02.972 --> 28:04.724
This is absurd.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.685
Do you plan to humiliate our family?

28:08.186 --> 28:10.063
How could you put them together?

28:10.438 --> 28:12.023
Is your business that important?

28:12.440 --> 28:15.568
Who cares if we suffer a little loss
because the marriage falls through?

28:16.986 --> 28:19.614
Is that more important
than your son's pride?

28:20.907 --> 28:24.244
Can't you imagine
how hurt Jeong-hun would be?

28:25.412 --> 28:27.288
If he's hurt from something like that,

28:27.372 --> 28:29.124
he isn't worthy of being my first son.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.501
I worked all my life
to build this company.

28:31.709 --> 28:34.379
I started with nothing
and made it this far,

28:34.462 --> 28:37.507
because I abandoned all pride and pain.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.260
He's like that because you spoiled him.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.513
What about Ji-hun?

28:45.181 --> 28:47.100
Why are you so supportive of him?

28:48.351 --> 28:49.936
Why are you going this far

28:50.395 --> 28:52.939
just to support him?

28:54.065 --> 28:55.567
Do you plan to give him the company

28:56.025 --> 28:57.736
and not to Jeong-hun
who is your first son?

28:58.111 --> 28:59.320
Who knows?

28:59.404 --> 29:01.906
Who cares about being the first
or second child if you're competent?

29:01.990 --> 29:05.034
He always did as he pleased and only
started working at the company now.

29:05.118 --> 29:08.121
He is a novice
who can barely operate one restaurant.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.414
Did I say anything?

29:09.789 --> 29:11.791
This is why he can't accept you
as his mother.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.501
What did you say?

29:13.710 --> 29:14.836
Get out.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.880
I'm very exhausted these days.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.094
What's your relationship with that woman?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.431
I know I'm in no position to ask,

29:27.432 --> 29:29.642
but I've imagined all sorts of things.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.228
"What could it be? Who could she be?

29:32.479 --> 29:33.938
Maybe they're pretending

29:34.355 --> 29:35.982
because of circumstances."

29:37.358 --> 29:39.861
I saw that picture with my own eyes,
but I couldn't believe it.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.529
You're right.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.448
It's as you deduced.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.366
It's fake.

29:45.658 --> 29:46.659
Right?

29:48.995 --> 29:50.121
I knew it.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.917
It made no sense that a woman
like that would be dating you.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.797
I need to go back home.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.549
I'm tired from meeting
so many people today.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.803
Can't you tell me now what's going on?

30:05.762 --> 30:07.138
I'll tell you once it's more settled.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.724
Fine.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.392
I'll wait.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.728
Tell me when you want to.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.647
I can wait.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.859
Okay. Thanks.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.707
I haven't seen you in a while,

30:38.378 --> 30:40.338
so I'm a bit worried.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.340
Sad face.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.509
Sad face?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.636
No.

30:47.929 --> 30:48.930
Period.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.897
Delete.

31:14.789 --> 31:15.957
ONLY EMPLOYEES ALLOWED

31:16.082 --> 31:17.375
Eun-seong.

31:18.918 --> 31:20.044
Eun-seong.

31:26.259 --> 31:27.385
Mr. Han.

31:37.812 --> 31:38.938
Mr. Han.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.699
Eun-seong.

31:49.782 --> 31:50.909
Mister.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.035
How have you been?

31:52.118 --> 31:55.330
Were you the one who brought the cat food?

31:55.705 --> 31:56.706
Yes.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.876
Gosh, they must be so happy.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.589
Where have you been?

32:05.131 --> 32:06.758
I was on a business trip.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.260
My mom and I are also going
on a business trip.

32:09.510 --> 32:10.720
You? A business trip?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.764
My mom said

32:13.139 --> 32:15.433
she has to go far away on a business trip.

32:16.559 --> 32:17.936
She'll be gone for ten nights.

32:18.811 --> 32:21.856
During that time, I'm going
on a business trip to Auntie Ju-yeon's.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.317
If I'm good for ten nights,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.027
Mom said she'd bring me a gift.

32:34.494 --> 32:35.745
When did you come?

32:36.788 --> 32:37.914
-Mom.
-Yes?

32:40.541 --> 32:41.668
Just a minute.

32:42.585 --> 32:43.711
Just a minute.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.755
Keep playing.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.718
What happened with the surgery?

32:50.843 --> 32:52.637
Can't you tell me what happened?

32:55.056 --> 32:56.391
Why do you want to know?

32:57.767 --> 32:59.769
It won't be canceled again,
so don't worry.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.272
That's not it.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.482
It's in two days, right?

33:05.775 --> 33:07.026
I hope you're ready for it.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.429
Hello, Dad.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.722
Why do you sound like that?

33:36.431 --> 33:37.765
Are you moved to tears?

33:39.767 --> 33:41.686
Is there a problem?

33:42.103 --> 33:44.731
I thought you couldn't forget
about each other.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.191
No, it's not that.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.027
I'm just so thankful.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.195
If I showed this much consideration

33:51.279 --> 33:53.656
to someone who created such a huge mess,

33:54.574 --> 33:56.826
you should be thanking me profusely.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.204
Explain everything to Na-yoon thoroughly.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.789
I'm sure she'll understand.

34:02.749 --> 34:03.958
I'll think of something

34:04.459 --> 34:05.918
to tell her parents.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.255
Okay. I will.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.215
Goodbye.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.742
Mom,

34:37.992 --> 34:41.454
can't I sleep with the cats
just for tonight?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.122
You can't. No cats.

34:43.414 --> 34:46.042
Come on. It's cold outside today.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.044
No. Wash up and go to bed.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.462
Let's go to bed, Eun-seong.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.223
Hye-su.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.390
-Yes?
-Can we talk?

35:01.516 --> 35:02.517
Sure.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.687
Gosh.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.898
It's spring now.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.943
It's nice and warm now.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.570
Anyway,

35:15.530 --> 35:16.656
Hye-su.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.407
I told the employees

35:18.783 --> 35:20.284
that I'm sending you to Jeju Island

35:20.368 --> 35:22.745
to work on the project
with the resort we're partnering with.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.123
It isn't entirely false.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.125
We'll be opening a branch there.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.877
They'd be shocked if you were

35:30.211 --> 35:31.629
to suddenly quit,

35:31.712 --> 35:34.549
and they may start talking again.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.592
I see.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.598
Come back once you're recovered.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.143
I'll make sure

35:45.268 --> 35:48.229
your job is secure and waiting.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.523
Thank you.

35:50.606 --> 35:51.899
Not at all.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.359
Ji-hun...

35:53.693 --> 35:55.778
I mean, Mr. Han should be thanking you.

35:56.362 --> 35:59.532
That punk talks tough, but he has

35:59.824 --> 36:00.950
a soft heart.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.661
He feels really bad. You know that, right?

36:11.002 --> 36:12.587
Is that a customer?

36:13.504 --> 36:14.755
I'll go in first.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.382
Hello.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.384
Just a minute.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.015
Hello.

36:24.473 --> 36:26.767
I came with my colleagues
to eat after our recital.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.477
I see.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.314
Are you busy right now?
Please make some time for me.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.819
I heard from Ji-hun

36:37.445 --> 36:38.654
about you two.

36:39.864 --> 36:40.865
Sorry?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.658
I don't know the details.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.368
I just know

36:44.744 --> 36:46.913
that you're not really dating.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.873
I wondered what was going on,

36:48.956 --> 36:51.542
but I decided to wait until he tells me.

36:52.585 --> 36:53.961
I see.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.590
What's your name?

36:58.841 --> 37:00.593
Kang Hye-su.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.178
Hye-su.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.138
I'm Seo Na-yoon.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.598
You know who I am, right?

37:06.641 --> 37:07.892
You overheard last time.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.645
-I didn't mean--
-It's fine.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.356
Ji-hun and I are getting back together.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.736
You are?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.863
Is that a problem?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.032
Not at all.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.742
Congratulations.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.704
Can I really be congratulated for this?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.456
Of course.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.834
He can tell you the details.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.670
I'm in no position to say.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.215
The only thing I can say for sure

37:40.174 --> 37:43.261
is that you're the one he truly likes.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.222
Please don't ask me how I know,

37:46.639 --> 37:48.266
and just let me congratulate you.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.937
I'm sorry, but I need to get back to work.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.480
I'll get going now.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.898
Sure.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.907
-Really?
-I didn't expect that from you.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.701
-Is it a shotgun wedding?
-It's not like that.

38:06.784 --> 38:07.910
-That's crazy.
-Let's drink.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.954
-Let's drink.
-All right.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.747
-That's great news!
-About your wedding...

38:11.831 --> 38:13.207
You're hiding something, aren't you?

38:13.332 --> 38:14.292
Sorry?

38:14.375 --> 38:16.294
Why are you suddenly being transferred
to Jeju Island?

38:16.377 --> 38:17.670
Am I supposed to congratulate you?

38:18.170 --> 38:19.839
I'm not sure.

38:19.922 --> 38:21.507
Where's the cream pasta?

38:21.590 --> 38:23.217
Stop rushing me. It's almost done.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.594
Aren't those customers so pretty?

38:25.761 --> 38:29.098
They're from some orchestra,
and they look like goddesses.

38:29.348 --> 38:30.474
Right?

38:34.061 --> 38:36.522
-I'm jealous.
-He can't be in it.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.565
One, two.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.695
Hey.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.030
You have a guest.

38:44.780 --> 38:45.906
A guest?

38:45.990 --> 38:46.866
Well,

38:46.949 --> 38:48.117
it's Seo Na-yoon.

38:48.617 --> 38:49.827
Did you invite her?

38:54.206 --> 38:55.333
Ji-hun.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.295
When did you come?

38:59.378 --> 39:01.881
Why weren't you answering your phone?
I called so many times.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.175
I had it on vibrate.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.261
I came to have dinner with my colleagues.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.138
We're celebrating after our recital.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.474
I'm glad I could see you.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.477
Come here.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.523
Let me introduce you.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.567
This is Han Ji-hun,

39:21.650 --> 39:24.945
the director of Restaurant Services
from the head office.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.698
-Impressive.
-Silence.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.450
He's my longtime friend.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.911
He's a very close friend
from when I studied abroad.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.037
A very close friend?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.081
-Not your boyfriend?
-I'm sure he is.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.999
You can imagine what you wish.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.584
If you ask anything more, you'll get hurt.

39:38.667 --> 39:39.710
We're going to get hurt.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.170
Na-yoon is scary.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.631
Are you done with dinner?

39:43.714 --> 39:44.715
Yes.

39:44.799 --> 39:45.883
Please join us.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.093
-Na-yoon.
-Sit with us.

39:47.593 --> 39:48.469
Hurry.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.973
-I'm sorry.
-Just admit it.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.976
-That's right.
-There's something going on, right?

39:56.143 --> 39:58.604
-You're right.
-I'm sure they're dating.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.773
-They look good together.
-Raise your glasses.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.359
Please enjoy.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.035
Hye-su, we need to talk.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.703
I need to finish this.

40:14.787 --> 40:15.996
-Have someone else do it.
-Let go.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.081
Now.

40:17.790 --> 40:18.916
What's your problem?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.209
I'm sorry.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.175
Gosh, you brat.

40:28.717 --> 40:29.760
What?

40:29.844 --> 40:32.221
Go home. You have surgery tomorrow.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.850
He's using you very well, isn't he?

40:36.142 --> 40:38.060
I have a lot of things to finish up.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.937
Stop being so twisted.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.275
Look at that piece of trash.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.402
His mom is getting surgery tomorrow,

40:47.236 --> 40:49.321
and he's having a drinking party
with girls.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.990
How could anyone like him?

40:51.323 --> 40:52.992
You have no luck with husbands.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.330
That was the funniest thing
you've said so far.

41:00.624 --> 41:01.750
What about Eun-seong?

41:02.168 --> 41:04.753
She'll be staying with Ju-yeon
for the time being.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.755
Gosh. Whatever.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.926
It's your life and your choice.
What can I do?

41:11.385 --> 41:13.262
I won't care whether you die or not.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.474
I'm going home.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.267
Suffer if you want.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.491
There are so many pretty ones, right?

41:34.200 --> 41:35.326
What about these?

41:35.701 --> 41:36.827
They're pretty.

41:39.747 --> 41:40.915
How old are you?

41:41.207 --> 41:42.583
I'm seven.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.086
Why do you keep looking at me?

41:46.170 --> 41:47.588
Because you're so pretty.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.548
I'm looking because you're so pretty.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.509
Here you go.

41:51.926 --> 41:52.927
Yes.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.725
This one is on the house.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.144
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.193
Aunt.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.153
Aunt.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.363
What?

42:12.780 --> 42:14.323
You're spaced out.

42:15.157 --> 42:17.201
She looked so smart.

42:18.285 --> 42:19.411
Let's go.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.248
What's wrong with you? Go where?

42:22.331 --> 42:24.500
If you want to see her so badly,
just go and see her.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.920
What are you drawing?

42:29.213 --> 42:30.130
What?

42:30.214 --> 42:32.007
It's a heart.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.219
Welcome.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.267
Mister.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.476
Hi, Eun-seong.

42:43.811 --> 42:44.937
Have you been doing well?

42:50.776 --> 42:52.111
Hello.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.366
Eun-seong, she wanted to meet you

42:57.658 --> 43:00.035
because you're so pretty.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.246
She is...

43:06.125 --> 43:07.626
Have you had dinner?

43:08.168 --> 43:09.169
Yes.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.090
Seung-ju.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.304
Is she here every evening?

43:20.681 --> 43:23.934
No. Only when Hye-su is late.

43:24.810 --> 43:25.936
Here.

43:26.562 --> 43:27.771
Have some apples.

43:30.899 --> 43:32.860
She's caused quite
an inconvenience to you.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.486
Not at all.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.905
I'm free in the evenings,

43:36.989 --> 43:39.992
and Hye-su brings me
a whole bunch of food.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.458
Her eyes and lips look

43:48.375 --> 43:50.044
just like her dad's.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.297
Do you know my dad?

43:54.423 --> 43:55.507
Yes.

43:56.717 --> 43:57.718
I do.

43:58.218 --> 43:59.345
I know him well.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.725
My dad passed away before I was born.

44:05.726 --> 44:06.727
Yes.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.105
When your dad was alive,

44:10.314 --> 44:11.815
I saw him a lot.

44:13.984 --> 44:15.110
I see.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.655
You saw her, so let's go.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.869
Eun-seong,

44:25.162 --> 44:26.455
you need to grow up quickly

44:27.289 --> 44:29.500
and be good to your mom, okay?

44:29.917 --> 44:33.045
I will. My mom says that all the time.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.588
She tells me to grow up quickly.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.549
I promised to be this big

44:37.883 --> 44:40.052
when she comes back
from her business trip.

44:40.511 --> 44:42.680
She said she'll give me
ten sheets of stickers.

44:45.391 --> 44:46.517
Business trip?

44:47.184 --> 44:49.019
She goes on business trips?

44:50.020 --> 44:52.231
-Yes.
-You see,

44:52.314 --> 44:55.401
Hye-su is very appreciated
at the restaurant.

44:55.484 --> 44:56.610
Right, Seung-ju?

44:57.277 --> 44:58.487
Yes. Aunt,

44:59.363 --> 45:00.864
it's time to go.

45:01.407 --> 45:03.200
She needs to sleep. Let's go.

45:03.575 --> 45:04.701
Eun-seong,

45:05.702 --> 45:08.539
how is your future dad?

45:10.082 --> 45:12.334
Does he and your mom get along?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.421
Let's go.

45:15.546 --> 45:18.882
Let go of me. Stop rushing me.

45:46.785 --> 45:48.162
Did you enjoy your meal?

45:48.704 --> 45:51.748
Yes. The pasta and salad were
all outstanding.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.459
Everyone loved it.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.794
I'm glad. Thank you.

46:11.977 --> 46:13.604
Did you work here long?

46:14.480 --> 46:15.939
No, it hasn't been that long.

46:19.234 --> 46:20.068
Oh, my.

46:23.489 --> 46:25.240
I'm sorry, but could you please
put this away?

46:28.827 --> 46:29.828
Sure.

46:31.079 --> 46:32.206
Thanks.

46:38.212 --> 46:41.548
Ms. Kang, you've had your eye
on Mr. Han all this time.

46:41.757 --> 46:43.008
You must be so upset.

46:43.425 --> 46:44.510
Poor thing.

46:44.718 --> 46:46.386
He has such a beautiful girlfriend.

46:48.096 --> 46:49.264
I know.

46:49.806 --> 46:52.768
What do I do? I'd better give up now.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.574
Gosh.

47:50.325 --> 47:53.078
That punk. What is he thinking?

47:53.161 --> 47:55.664
Mr. Park, who's getting married?

47:55.747 --> 47:57.416
Is Mr. Han getting married?

47:57.499 --> 48:00.294
-A-ra, please go in and work.
-Excuse me.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.503
The customer is calling.

48:02.379 --> 48:03.505
Gosh.

48:05.841 --> 48:06.758
What?

48:09.136 --> 48:10.762
Jeong-hun.

48:13.807 --> 48:15.350
That cunning rat.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.560
-Here.
-Yes.

48:16.893 --> 48:18.020
Jeong-hun...

48:25.694 --> 48:26.987
Look who's here.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.572
Jeong-hun.

48:31.867 --> 48:34.286
Look at him avoiding my eyes.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.496
He knows what he did wrong.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.498
-Jeong-hun, let's talk outside--
-Let go.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.293
What are you doing?

48:45.756 --> 48:46.882
Hey, punk.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.426
Aren't you going to greet your brother?

48:49.968 --> 48:52.721
Do you think I'm doing this
because of this bitch?

48:53.263 --> 48:54.514
It's not about her.

48:54.598 --> 48:55.724
Jeong-hun.

48:55.807 --> 48:58.518
Get away, you brat.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.566
Ji-hun,

49:04.775 --> 49:07.736
how can someone be so ungrateful?

49:08.403 --> 49:10.947
We raised you because you were a poor bum
and took pity on you.

49:11.156 --> 49:12.324
Did you forget the past?

49:12.741 --> 49:15.869
Is that it? You were kissing up to Dad,

49:15.952 --> 49:17.746
-and now you're all confident?
-Jeong-hun, please.

49:17.829 --> 49:18.872
Let go, you...

49:19.956 --> 49:21.875
-Let go.
-That's enough.

49:22.334 --> 49:23.460
Let's talk at home.

49:25.420 --> 49:26.755
What? At home?

49:27.297 --> 49:30.634
Where is your home?

49:30.717 --> 49:32.969
Where, you bum?

49:33.053 --> 49:35.305
-Please let go first.
-Let go.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.932
Let go.

49:37.015 --> 49:38.517
-Let go.
-Please stop, Jeong-hun.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.644
Get on your knees, you rat.

49:40.727 --> 49:43.313
Kneel before your older brother!

49:43.647 --> 49:44.648
Let go.

49:44.731 --> 49:45.857
Let go of me.

49:49.569 --> 49:51.154
You rat. Stop right there!

50:08.755 --> 50:09.881
You punk.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.883
Stop right there!

50:13.343 --> 50:14.344
Are you all right?

50:14.428 --> 50:16.430
-Are you blind?
-I'm sorry.

50:17.681 --> 50:18.807
Wait.

50:19.349 --> 50:22.018
Look who this is.

50:22.519 --> 50:25.147
That's right. You're Ji-hun's girlfriend.

50:25.522 --> 50:27.649
Play with me too.

50:27.941 --> 50:28.859
Listen.

50:29.109 --> 50:32.487
That punk just loves swapping girls.

50:32.571 --> 50:35.365
You need to play with me too to be fair.

50:35.449 --> 50:36.908
How much do you want?

50:36.992 --> 50:39.286
How much do I need to give you?

50:39.369 --> 50:40.787
How much?

50:43.623 --> 50:44.916
Why you...

50:45.000 --> 50:47.794
How much do I need to give you?

50:47.878 --> 50:49.421
How much do you want?

50:52.090 --> 50:53.216
You punk.

50:54.342 --> 50:55.469
Did you just hit me?

50:55.719 --> 50:57.220
You rat.

51:00.724 --> 51:01.600
You punk.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.351
-How dare you hit your big brother?
-Come here.

51:03.435 --> 51:04.644
-Come here!
-Stop it.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.439
-Ji-hun.
-Let go!

51:07.522 --> 51:08.607
Did you just hit me?

51:08.690 --> 51:09.649
-Stop it.
-Let go!

51:09.733 --> 51:11.401
Let go of me!

51:11.485 --> 51:12.486
Ji-hun.

51:12.569 --> 51:14.362
Hey! Please.

51:14.613 --> 51:16.698
-You rat!
-Ji-hun.

51:38.553 --> 51:39.554
I'm sorry.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.391
Why are you sorry? What did you do wrong?

52:04.746 --> 52:05.872
Ms. Oh,

52:06.623 --> 52:08.166
your son is here.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.305
Why are you pitifully sitting like that
and not sleeping?

52:24.850 --> 52:26.810
What is it at this hour?

52:39.614 --> 52:41.116
I came to say goodbye.

52:45.203 --> 52:46.496
I won't be coming anymore.

52:48.957 --> 52:50.083
I may

52:51.501 --> 52:53.128
never see you again.

52:57.048 --> 52:58.174
Have a good life.

52:59.384 --> 53:00.510
Good luck with the surgery.

53:05.682 --> 53:06.808
Did your dad

53:07.893 --> 53:09.227
tell you to do that?

53:10.854 --> 53:12.814
I'm not a 12-year-old kid.

53:14.149 --> 53:15.734
Saying farewell isn't a big deal.

53:16.776 --> 53:17.903
Right?

53:19.863 --> 53:20.989
Let's pretend

53:21.823 --> 53:24.367
the other moved to a faraway place
like Alaska.

53:41.760 --> 53:42.886
Mom.

53:45.013 --> 53:46.139
Ms. Oh Mi-ran.

54:06.326 --> 54:07.577
When I was little,

54:10.914 --> 54:12.624
we longed for Dad,

54:16.503 --> 54:18.630
and all we had was each other.

54:21.257 --> 54:23.343
We were lonely back then,

54:25.929 --> 54:27.597
but it was fun
and it felt like we were friends.

54:29.599 --> 54:30.725
Wasn't it?

54:32.602 --> 54:33.812
Whatever.

54:46.491 --> 54:48.034
I like those memories.

54:54.249 --> 54:55.375
From now on,

54:57.502 --> 54:58.962
just remember the good things.

55:06.094 --> 55:07.387
After your surgery,

55:11.349 --> 55:13.226
only look at the good things.

55:16.271 --> 55:17.814
And stop hating Dad.

55:37.584 --> 55:38.668
I'll get going now.

57:14.222 --> 57:16.516
Rock-a-bye baby

57:17.225 --> 57:19.018
On the treetop

57:20.019 --> 57:22.647
When the wind blows

57:23.773 --> 57:24.899
You can't sleep?

57:25.233 --> 57:26.359
I can't.

57:30.947 --> 57:31.781
Gosh.

57:32.907 --> 57:34.242
I'm not surprised.

57:34.951 --> 57:37.412
It will be okay.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.624
Be strong.

57:42.083 --> 57:43.376
It'll all be fine.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.046
Let's play.

57:47.797 --> 57:49.591
Stop that.

57:52.218 --> 57:54.596
I must confess.

57:54.929 --> 57:55.930
What?

58:00.894 --> 58:03.146
Your mother-in-law came by

58:03.480 --> 58:04.898
to see Eun-seong today.

58:07.150 --> 58:08.985
She asked me to keep it a secret,

58:09.194 --> 58:12.989
but I didn't think it should be.

58:15.867 --> 58:16.993
It's okay, right?

58:18.578 --> 58:19.704
Yes.

58:25.627 --> 58:26.669
Gosh.

58:27.420 --> 58:29.547
Whatever. Anyway,

58:30.715 --> 58:32.383
I envy your life.

58:33.676 --> 58:36.888
I never had a husband, but you got two.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.310
Ju-yeon.

58:43.102 --> 58:44.103
What?

58:44.187 --> 58:45.730
I think you were right.

58:46.981 --> 58:49.317
I think I mistook him to be
my real husband.

58:49.776 --> 58:50.777
What?

58:52.153 --> 58:53.279
My heart fluttered a bit.

58:56.866 --> 58:59.244
What do you mean?

58:59.619 --> 59:01.162
Your heart fluttered?

59:02.413 --> 59:03.748
Don't take it seriously.

59:04.290 --> 59:06.626
You're still young.
Your heart still flutters.

59:06.876 --> 59:08.002
Right?

59:09.796 --> 59:10.922
You're right.

59:11.589 --> 59:13.716
I'm not even sure whether I'll live.

59:14.634 --> 59:16.427
I'm still young.

59:17.178 --> 59:18.555
You're confident too.

59:18.638 --> 59:19.764
I'm not old yet.

59:22.517 --> 59:23.643
Be quiet.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.605
Keep it down. You'll wake her.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.483
Be quiet.

59:33.653 --> 59:36.030
-Eun-seong.
-Did we wake you?

59:36.114 --> 59:37.490
-My baby.
-Hey!

59:38.783 --> 59:40.034
Let's not be like Auntie.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.369
Stop that.

59:41.452 --> 59:42.453
Move.

59:42.537 --> 59:43.955
Come on.

59:47.292 --> 59:50.587
Eun-seong, listen to Auntie
and be a good girl, okay?

59:50.795 --> 59:52.088
Okay. Have a safe trip.

59:52.422 --> 59:53.464
Wait.

59:54.924 --> 59:55.800
That's right.

59:55.883 --> 59:57.343
Just a minute, Mom.

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:03.933
Come back safely.

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:05.143
Take care of my daughter.

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:11.232
Mom, wait.

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:13.443
Here.

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:15.612
What's this?

1:00:15.695 --> 1:00:18.114
No, don't read it now. Read it later.

1:00:18.197 --> 1:00:19.449
It's a secret letter.

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:22.118
Okay.

1:00:22.535 --> 1:00:23.536
Give me a kiss.

1:00:25.079 --> 1:00:26.205
Bye.

1:00:27.081 --> 1:00:27.999
I'll get going.

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:30.627
I'm leaving now.

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:34.297
Good luck on your business trip.

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:38.384
Bye, Mom.

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:39.594
Bye.

1:00:39.844 --> 1:00:40.762
Good luck.

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:55.109
Mom, good luck on your business trip.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:58.446
Don't worry about me
and do your work, okay?

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:00.823
I am so proud of you.

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:03.534
My mom is the best. I love you.

1:01:30.561 --> 1:01:31.688
Hello.

1:01:33.189 --> 1:01:34.315
Hello.

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:35.858
What do we do?

1:01:35.942 --> 1:01:37.485
She went missing.

1:01:37.610 --> 1:01:39.654
-What?
-She was here early this morning,

1:01:39.779 --> 1:01:41.197
but when I stepped out to get water...

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:42.782
What do we do?

1:01:47.203 --> 1:01:49.247
CUSTOMER ANALYSIS

1:01:49.372 --> 1:01:50.707
In today's society,

1:01:50.790 --> 1:01:52.458
due to the increase of working women
these days,

1:01:52.750 --> 1:01:55.211
there also has been an increase in demand

1:01:55.461 --> 1:01:56.796
for high-quality restaurants that...

1:02:53.561 --> 1:02:56.522
Can you do something for me one last time?

1:02:57.148 --> 1:02:59.525
Does he still make your heart flutter?

1:03:00.693 --> 1:03:02.195
They're together right now.

1:03:02.278 --> 1:03:04.447
I wish you'd tell me everything.

1:03:05.072 --> 1:03:06.908
And what is he doing with that woman?

1:03:07.950 --> 1:03:09.160
Take care.

1:03:10.036 --> 1:03:11.162
Thanks for everything.

1:03:11.621 --> 1:03:13.748
Since the surgery isn't happening,
divorce her right away.

1:03:13.831 --> 1:03:16.959
I'd like to say goodbye one last time.

1:03:17.502 --> 1:03:18.753
Just give me two days.

1:03:22.381 --> 1:03:24.509
