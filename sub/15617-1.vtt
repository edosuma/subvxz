03:29.329 --> 03:31.829
That's my sister
Skylar and her boyfriend Holden.

03:31.912 --> 03:36.287
And that's me.
Well, I'm Djuna. D-J-U-N-A.

03:36.371 --> 03:38.455
Oh, and everyone calls me D.J.

03:38.538 --> 03:40.538
Now, I'm gonna level with ya.

03:40.622 --> 03:44.580
We are not the typical kind of family
you'd find in a musical comedy.

03:44.622 --> 03:46.580
For one thing, we got dough.

03:46.663 --> 03:50.872
And we live right here on Park Avenue
in a big apartment; a penthouse.

03:50.913 --> 03:55.581
Dad's a lawyer. I mean, I call him
"Dad," but actually he's stepdad.

03:55.664 --> 04:00.289
There's original Dad
who married Mom and they had me.

04:00.373 --> 04:04.123
And there's stepdad. Well, he had
two kids with his first wife when...

04:04.206 --> 04:07.207
Look, maybe this is all
getting a little confusing.

04:07.249 --> 04:09.374
You see, there's Lane and Laura.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.915
Those are my half-sisters,
and they're really great.

04:11.957 --> 04:14.915
A little twitty at times,
but we love each other...

04:14.957 --> 04:17.457
and we have
a million laughs together.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.458
And, of course, my stepbrother
Scott, who's very smart...

04:20.541 --> 04:22.625
but currently on the outs
with the family...

04:22.708 --> 04:24.708
because he's become
a conservative Republican...

04:24.791 --> 04:27.208
which has caused my stepfather
to have a stroke...

04:27.250 --> 04:29.208
since we're all liberal Democrats.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.708
How can you expect
people on welfare...

04:31.750 --> 04:34.501
to develop any sort of incentives
if they're getting handouts?

04:34.584 --> 04:38.459
What are you saying? Somebody who can't work
for one reason or another has to be discarded?

04:38.542 --> 04:41.667
Welfare does not work. It's the same
outmoded liberal fantasy world...

04:41.751 --> 04:45.834
as affirmative action, not allowing
school prayer and coddling of criminals.

04:45.917 --> 04:49.668
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my own flesh and blood.

04:49.752 --> 04:54.085
Unless some large Republican pea pods are in
the basement and have taken over your body.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.043
Not pods, Dad. Ideas.

04:56.085 --> 04:58.043
Virile, modern ideas.

04:58.085 --> 05:00.627
A strong America.
The right to bear arms.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.628
- Arms? What are you... Guns?
- Yes!

05:02.711 --> 05:06.836
Are you crazy? What the hell is the matter
with you? I don't understand you anymore.

05:06.919 --> 05:09.628
- Why... Wait a minute. Excuse me.
- Relax, Bob.

05:09.711 --> 05:13.294
Steffi, bring down a copy
of my will and an eraser, okay?

05:13.378 --> 05:15.544
If Dad's a liberal Democrat,

05:15.586 --> 05:18.587
then you'd have to say Mom
is the one thing more extreme.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.670
She's a guilty liberal Democrat.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.587
Well, he grew up poor and he knows
what it is to work like a dog.

05:24.670 --> 05:26.920
But Mom came from money and luxury...

05:27.004 --> 05:31.088
and, you know, spends all her time
doing volunteer work for everybody.

05:31.171 --> 05:35.755
She's with the American Civil Liberties
Union and Save the Whales...

05:35.838 --> 05:39.671
and she raises dough for the
Whitney Museum and Lenox Hill Hospital.

05:39.755 --> 05:41.713
She's always got something going,

05:41.796 --> 05:46.131
like throwing some chic soiree
to help the New York Philharmonic.

06:50.968 --> 06:53.343
Lane and Laura go to Nightingale,

06:53.426 --> 06:56.302
which is this ritzy school
on East 92nd Street.

07:00.261 --> 07:03.636
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, there he is.

07:03.719 --> 07:05.844
- He is so gorgeous.
- Who is he?

07:05.927 --> 07:09.803
We don't know, but we always
see him around this neighborhood.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.803
- She's in love from afar. - I'm sure we can
think of a way to get her to meet him.

07:13.887 --> 07:16.720
Please, no humiliating schemes.

07:18.845 --> 07:21.428
You guys, my mom is
in there with a patient.

07:21.512 --> 07:25.263
Claire's their best friend.
Her mom's a shrink on Central Park West.

07:25.346 --> 07:28.263
Years ago, Claire drilled
a secret hole in the wall,

07:28.304 --> 07:33.304
and we get our kicks after school
sometimes kinda tuning in on her clientele.

07:33.388 --> 07:38.930
I've been having these fantasies
about... other men,

07:39.014 --> 07:41.305
and, uh... you know,

07:41.389 --> 07:44.264
it makes me feel bad and, um,

07:44.347 --> 07:46.555
you know, guilty.

07:46.597 --> 07:51.305
Oh, I ha... Um, I had
that elevator dream... again.

07:51.389 --> 07:54.431
And, um, I'm in the elevator...

07:54.515 --> 07:58.348
and... it just keeps going up...

07:58.431 --> 08:01.140
and up and up.

08:01.223 --> 08:03.806
Now you have to meet Grandpa.

08:03.890 --> 08:06.891
Eighty-eight years old.

08:06.974 --> 08:09.057
Found him at Grand Central Station.

08:09.099 --> 08:11.432
- He thought he was
at the Botanical Gardens. - Thanks.

08:11.516 --> 08:13.974
You have to keep your eye on him.

08:14.057 --> 08:16.349
Last year he wandered out
of the bathroom in a towel...

08:16.432 --> 08:18.349
and got on line in Times Square.

08:18.432 --> 08:22.475
We had to send Frieda to get him back.
Oh, she's our maid.

08:22.558 --> 08:25.558
Personally, I think she was
Hitler's maid at Berchtesgaden,

08:25.642 --> 08:27.892
but she's the only one
who can handle Grandpa.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.558
I found your arch supports in the stew!
Whatever were they doing in the stew?

08:34.642 --> 08:37.058
Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Frieda.

08:37.101 --> 08:41.518
Finally, there's my
dad, who lives in Paris but visits a lot.

08:41.601 --> 08:44.309
You see, he and my stepdad
are great friends.

08:44.393 --> 08:48.852
And if you ask me, he still has a crush on
Mom, although they've been divorced for years.

08:48.935 --> 08:52.560
They're all friends, though, and they
come to each other with problems.

08:52.602 --> 08:55.685
I can't believe it.
Giselle left me.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.894
Look at this face. She left me with my
best friend, suddenly, out of left field.

08:59.935 --> 09:02.852
- She didn't give any warning?
- Nothing at all. Look at that.

09:02.935 --> 09:06.895
Did you ever see anything... I'm so
distraught over this, I can't tell you.

09:06.978 --> 09:08.936
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Ohhh.

09:08.978 --> 09:12.228
I should go to Paris and jump off
the Eiffel Tower. I'll be dead.

09:12.311 --> 09:15.020
In fact, if I get the Concorde,
I could be dead three hours earlier,

09:15.103 --> 09:17.020
which would be perfect.

09:17.103 --> 09:19.646
Or... Wait a minute.
With the time change,

09:19.729 --> 09:23.604
I could be alive for six hours in
New York, but dead three hours in Paris.

09:23.687 --> 09:26.437
- Sit down. Relax. - I could get things
done and I could also be dead.

09:26.521 --> 09:30.729
You didn't hear the signs.
She must've given you some signs, Joe.

09:30.771 --> 09:34.188
What do you think I am, an idiot? What
kind of signs you think she gave me?

09:34.272 --> 09:38.688
I found this photo in her underwear drawer?
She muttered his name when making love?

09:38.772 --> 09:41.772
- I'm not talking about that.
- No, that's what happened.

09:41.855 --> 09:44.563
- What? Joe! - I didn't see it.
I couldn't put it together.

09:44.647 --> 09:48.231
I'm really glad you didn't marry her.
I told you, don't do it.

09:48.314 --> 09:51.231
- I would've been happy to marry her.
- I'm really glad.

09:51.273 --> 09:53.481
You want a glass of something?
Some wine?

09:53.564 --> 09:57.231
I'll take anything. I gotta have
a drink. Know what the sad part is?

09:57.273 --> 10:02.774
- I thought everything was going well.
- You always pick the wrong women.

10:02.857 --> 10:05.607
- Hey, I picked you.
- Yeah, we got divorced.

10:05.690 --> 10:09.607
- 'Cause you were impossible to live with.
- I was impossible to live with?

10:09.690 --> 10:12.524
I love this. You couldn't figure out
whether you wanted to be...

10:12.607 --> 10:14.691
a psychoanalyst or a writer.

10:14.775 --> 10:17.733
So, I compromised.
I became a writer and a patient.

10:17.816 --> 10:20.775
We're gonna find you somebody.
We... We know a lot of people.

10:20.858 --> 10:23.566
- Can't we find somebody?
- I've been trying since we got divorced...

10:23.650 --> 10:27.733
to find the right woman for him,
somebody to match up with his personality.

10:27.775 --> 10:30.234
But I'm beginning...
Honey, bring another glass.

10:30.276 --> 10:34.151
I'm beginning to wonder if the world
population of women isn't too limited.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.151
- Thank you.
- Well, I mean...

10:36.234 --> 10:40.276
- You've had really bad luck. - No, he hasn't.
He's had an unerring sense of poor choice.

10:40.359 --> 10:44.777
And the question is, does he want to spend
his golden years with somebody or not?

10:44.860 --> 10:47.902
- What, are you into
my golden years suddenly? - Yes.

10:47.985 --> 10:50.944
- You have to think about those things.
- Men age differently than women.

10:51.027 --> 10:55.027
- Two more years, I'm gonna look
like your son. - Oh, that was so mean.

10:55.110 --> 10:56.945
Don't you laugh.

10:57.028 --> 11:00.445
Don't talk about my golden years.
She's got me in a home already.

11:00.486 --> 11:03.611
What about Madeline?
After me.

11:03.695 --> 11:07.403
Madeline was won... Madeline was
an archaeologist. She was fabulous.

11:07.445 --> 11:09.403
Madeline was a nymphomaniac.

11:09.445 --> 11:12.071
Yeah, okay, she had
a little problem with fidelity.

11:12.154 --> 11:15.362
- I didn't happen to see it. But she was
a brilliant woman. - What about Carol?

11:15.446 --> 11:17.696
Remember Carol what's-her-name?

11:17.779 --> 11:21.821
- Carol was a poet, and a member of MENSA.
- She was a heroin addict.

11:21.904 --> 11:24.822
She was also a heroin addict,
but I thought it was insulin.

11:24.905 --> 11:28.363
- You know what the problem is? Listen.
- This is the problem.

11:28.447 --> 11:31.863
- He's still in love with you.
I've always said this. - Oh, honey.

11:31.947 --> 11:34.447
Who can blame him?
Of course he is.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.447
- Ah, come here. Come here, my two men.
- That's the problem.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.906
Two men.
I'm pining after Giselle.

11:39.948 --> 11:42.156
We're gonna get somebody
who's nearly normal.

11:42.239 --> 11:46.364
I don't know if we're gonna get
somebody. This is the problem.

11:48.948 --> 11:51.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:51.448 --> 11:54.740
Hey. What's all the secrecy about?
Why Harry Winstons?

11:54.824 --> 11:58.615
Listen... I want you to help me pick out
an engagement ring for Skylar.

11:58.699 --> 12:00.490
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

12:00.574 --> 12:03.824
So, you're looking
for an engagement ring?

12:03.907 --> 12:05.824
We're getting married.

12:05.907 --> 12:08.200
Uh, I'm getting married.
Not to her.

12:08.283 --> 12:11.325
Now, what size did you have in mind?

12:11.408 --> 12:13.741
- What size?
- Uh-huh.

12:13.783 --> 12:17.783
Oh, um... Well, she's not huge.

12:17.866 --> 12:20.283
I mean, she's not bony either.
She's got flesh.

12:20.325 --> 12:22.284
Something simple, but elegant?

12:22.326 --> 12:25.826
- That's it.
- Simple, but elegant. Exactly.

12:25.909 --> 12:30.117
- Like this one. - Oh, my God,
that's beautiful. That is beautiful.

12:30.201 --> 12:34.367
- Look at that. - That's the mos
beautiful thing I ever saw. Hello.

12:34.451 --> 12:36.910
So, what is that gonna cost me?
I like it.

12:36.993 --> 12:40.535
- Fifty-five thousand.
- Fifty-five thousand dollars, you say?

12:40.618 --> 12:44.993
Uh, well, let me take
this off then because...

12:45.077 --> 12:48.577
I don't think that...
Actually, as I look at it, it's really...

12:48.660 --> 12:52.744
To Skylar's taste, it's kind of...
tacky. She's not a mafia bride.

12:52.786 --> 12:55.203
- Will you help me out?
- Here's a lovely one.

12:55.286 --> 12:57.744
- That is... That is pretty.
- Pretty simple.

12:57.786 --> 12:59.744
Well, I don't...

12:59.786 --> 13:02.328
What is that gonna cost me?
About fifteen-hundred, 2,000?

13:02.411 --> 13:04.954
- Eight thousand.
- Eight thousand dollars.

13:05.037 --> 13:07.079
- Um...
- It's more in the ball park.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.412
- It's in the range.
- It's the right neighborhood.

13:09.495 --> 13:12.620
- Not my neighborhood, but...
- But it's a better neighborhood.

13:12.704 --> 13:16.162
What the hell. Right? 'Cause
we're getting married. Let's do it.

13:16.245 --> 13:20.538
- It's pretty.
- I think it's an absolutely exquisite ring.

Mrs. Holden Spence.

16:23.009 --> 16:25.509
Skylar Spence!
I love the sound of that.

16:25.593 --> 16:29.051
- He's taking her to Le Cirque for
dinner tonight. - Le Cirque? No kidding.

16:29.134 --> 16:32.259
- He's gonna propose.
- I don't wanna blow my own horn here,

16:32.343 --> 16:34.801
- but I'm the one who introduced them.
- We've heard it.

16:34.843 --> 16:37.594
I did!
He came to work at our law firm...

16:37.677 --> 16:40.427
The first day he was there,
I said, " This kid is great!

16:40.469 --> 16:43.135
His feet are on the ground.
He's perfect for her."

16:43.219 --> 16:45.135
Frieda, the pasta has no sauce.

16:45.219 --> 16:49.260
It's Bavarian pasta! It doesn't need
any sauce! Italian pasta needs sauce.

16:49.302 --> 16:52.928
- The Italians were weak!
- Okay, fine. Just gimme some pepper.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.845
I cannot understand you!

16:54.928 --> 16:58.053
Your solution to rampant crime
is let criminals go free?

16:58.136 --> 17:01.095
- No, Charles Ferry deserves
a parole. - What? What is this?

17:01.136 --> 17:04.971
Are you kidding me? You want
somebody like this out on the streets?

17:05.054 --> 17:09.012
"Armed robbery, assault, assault with
a deadly weapon, attempted escape."

17:09.096 --> 17:11.679
- Scott, he was an abused child.
- Have a little compassion.

17:11.762 --> 17:14.929
He went to prison his whole entire life
because he had a horrible childhood,

17:15.012 --> 17:17.387
which is something
you know nothing about.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.597
- Then one mistake after the other.
- One mistake?

17:19.637 --> 17:23.805
Yes. It leads to bad crime, corrupt...
I don't wanna discuss this with you.

17:23.888 --> 17:26.805
- I can't listen to any of this!
- I can't stand this.

17:26.847 --> 17:28.930
- I need my wallet.
- Where are you going?

17:29.014 --> 17:30.972
- Up to the Polo Grounds.
- No, no, no.

17:31.014 --> 17:34.390
- Giants and Cardinals are having
a doubleheader. - Pop, you can't go out.

17:34.473 --> 17:36.765
- If you wanna take a walk, you gotta
go with Frieda. - Good idea.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.390
- But they're playing today. This is
Labor Day. - It's June, Grandpa.

17:40.473 --> 17:43.098
- It's June.
- The Polo Grounds closed years ago.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.140
- Frieda, just take him for a short walk.
- Rained out?

17:46.181 --> 17:50.141
- I'm not going with Frieda.
- All right, okay.

17:50.224 --> 17:53.474
- I'm not going with her. I don't need
a German shepherd. - Take a nice walk.

17:53.557 --> 17:56.182
- You know what the kids tell me?
- German shepherd. I feel so...

17:56.266 --> 17:59.849
They think that Holden is gonna give
a little surprise to Skylar tonight.

17:59.932 --> 18:03.058
If you keep gossiping about it,
there's gonna be no surprise.

18:03.142 --> 18:06.392
- Honey, please...
- I'm going out.

18:06.475 --> 18:09.100
- Have a nice time. - If Minnie calls,
tell her I went to the Polo Grounds.

18:09.183 --> 18:11.767
Minnie's been
dead for 20 years, Grandpa.

18:11.850 --> 18:15.601
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying
if she calls, I'll be home later.

18:15.643 --> 18:18.143
You know,
21 is too young to get married,

18:18.184 --> 18:21.268
but if this was anybody but Holden,
I'd be against it.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.643
Well, there's no way I'm getting married
'til I'm 35 and I've lived,

18:24.726 --> 18:28.268
...and then I'll probably move in with
a woman. - Why do you make these jokes?

18:28.351 --> 18:30.435
- You like Holden, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:30.519 --> 18:34.185
The problem isn't Holden, it's Skylar.
She's a romantic twit.

18:34.269 --> 18:37.602
- Yeah. Her problem with Holden is
he's not romantic. - So what?

18:37.644 --> 18:41.060
- She's gonna marry him, right? -
I hope so. I want her room when she does.

18:41.144 --> 18:44.561
I'm serious. I don't see any reason
why he should not leap at this guy.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.770
Skylar suffers from
"white knight" syndrome.

18:46.811 --> 18:49.103
Ever since her hormones kicked in,

18:49.186 --> 18:51.770
she's been waiting for
some charismatic figure...

18:51.853 --> 18:53.811
to come and sweep her
off her feet.

18:53.853 --> 18:56.520
So Holden is that young Lochinvar.

18:56.603 --> 19:00.479
- He's that young schnook. - He's a
schnook, but he's a loveable schnook.

19:00.562 --> 19:04.146
- He's wonderful, and you... - What an
embarrassment. I'm never bringing a guy home.

19:04.229 --> 19:07.646
- You have to listen.

20:47.569 --> 20:49.778
Oh, I could never leave New York.

20:49.819 --> 20:53.362
We leave my parents in Sharon.
We'd live in New York, of course.

20:53.445 --> 20:57.112
It's just, at some point, we may want a
little more space if we have four kids.

20:57.195 --> 20:59.987
I want two children.

21:00.070 --> 21:03.945
Two kids is... Two is perfect!
Two is... Two is perfect for me.

21:03.987 --> 21:06.113
Because four is really a lot.

21:06.155 --> 21:09.155
And you'll be able
to stay at home with them and...

21:09.238 --> 21:11.196
No, I'll be working.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.571
I mean, when not working full-time.

21:13.655 --> 21:15.946
Of course, you're gonna have
a career: journalism.

21:16.030 --> 21:18.613
Architecture.

21:18.696 --> 21:20.864
Architecture? Since when?

21:20.947 --> 21:23.739
I don't know.
It's just some thoughts I've had.

21:23.822 --> 21:26.406
Thoughts you...
You majored in journalism, but...

21:26.489 --> 21:29.072
The point is...
The important thing is...

21:29.156 --> 21:32.031
I think we agree with each other
on just about everything.

21:32.114 --> 21:35.615
Shall I bring the dessert, sir?

21:35.698 --> 21:39.032
Oh, is... It's time for dessert.
Yes, it is.

21:39.115 --> 21:42.948
Will you excuse me for one second?
I'll just attend to a small matter.

21:42.990 --> 21:46.573
- It's ready just as you wished, Mr. Spence.
- You think it's gonna work?

21:46.657 --> 21:49.741
- Here we are, sir.
- Oh, look at... That's... That's perfect.

21:49.824 --> 21:53.033
- I'm glad you liked it.
- Now, let me show you my end of the deal.

21:53.116 --> 21:55.283
- Whoo! That's a honey, huh?
- Oh-ho. Oh, yes.

21:55.324 --> 21:58.158
Look at that.
It set me back just a little bit.

21:58.241 --> 22:02.117
It's a brilliant idea, sir.
Very romantic.

22:02.159 --> 22:05.575
- Yes, well, that's the kind of guy I am.
- Oh, I can see that.

22:05.659 --> 22:08.659
I'm just gonna lay that right down there.

22:08.742 --> 22:12.242
- Is that gonna knock her socks off?
I think so. - Yes, sir. Shall we?

22:12.325 --> 22:15.742
- I'm relying on you, Umberto.
- Good luck, sir.

22:17.201 --> 22:19.160
Is everything okay?

22:19.201 --> 22:21.160
- All taken care of.
- Shall we order dessert?

22:21.201 --> 22:23.160
- I took the liberty.
- You did?

22:23.201 --> 22:26.660
I know you like a take-charge kind
of guy and I'm comin' through for you.

22:26.743 --> 22:28.660
- It's not like you.
- Anything for you.

22:28.743 --> 22:31.452
- Umberto, will you please do the honors?
- Parfait!

22:31.494 --> 22:33.452
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, mmm!

22:33.494 --> 22:37.452
Oh, my God, it's delicious!
And peach, my favorite flavor.

22:37.536 --> 22:40.994
- It's delicious.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

22:41.036 --> 22:43.286
- What are you doing?
- Where's the rest of the dessert?

22:43.369 --> 22:45.870
- What do you mean? - Where the whipped
cream and the cherry are.

22:45.953 --> 22:48.037
- I ate it.
- You ate the ring?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.578
- What ring?
- Honey, I bought you a diamond ring!

22:50.662 --> 22:52.578
- You did?
- I went to Harry Winston's.

22:52.662 --> 22:55.120
- Where is it?
- I put it in the parfait.

22:55.162 --> 22:57.245
- Why?
- I thought it would be romantic!

22:57.328 --> 23:00.246
You thought it would be romantic
to put a ring on ice cream?

23:00.329 --> 23:03.329
- This was not my idea.
This was D.J.'s idea! - D.J.?

23:03.413 --> 23:06.413
She said it would give it
dramatic flair. I don't believe this.

23:06.496 --> 23:08.204
I ate a diamond ring?

23:08.288 --> 23:11.746
I turn around for two seconds and
there's $8,000 going down your throat.

23:11.829 --> 23:14.914
- I swallowed a... Oh, my God!
- Take it easy. Stay calm.

23:14.997 --> 23:17.955
- How big was it?
- It was tasteful, believe me.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.497
- It was a big rock.
- I swallowed a what? A karat?

23:20.580 --> 23:23.122
- It was a karat and a half, easily.
- You'd like two carrots?

23:23.205 --> 23:25.164
- I'm dying!
- You're not dying!

23:25.205 --> 23:29.248
- Something wrong, sir? - She just swallowed
a little jewelry. It's all right.

23:29.331 --> 23:31.248
- How could you?
- How could I?

23:31.331 --> 23:34.831
- Most people look at their food before
they lunge into it. -

23:34.915 --> 23:37.790
Let me check your mouth.

23:37.831 --> 23:40.415
I don't think this is going
to present much of a problem.

23:40.498 --> 23:42.957
It's lodged in an accessible place.

23:42.999 --> 23:45.624
It's an absolutely beautiful ring!
A solitaire.

23:45.707 --> 23:48.082
A classic. A brilliant choice.
Congratulations.

23:48.166 --> 23:51.291
Oh, congratulations, girl.
It is beautiful.

23:51.332 --> 23:54.624
Katie! Katie, look.
She got engaged.

23:54.666 --> 23:57.750
- So, uh, what is it, about two karats?
- No, a karat and a half.

23:57.833 --> 24:00.000
- White gold?
- No, it's solid platinum.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.000
- Solid?
- Harry Winston's.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.000
- What'd you pay?
- Eight thousand.

24:04.083 --> 24:07.833
I can get this same ring for you
for six from my brother-in-law.

24:07.917 --> 24:11.668
I am so happy for you!
He is a wonderful man.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.959

Summer came and Lane and

27:08.847 --> 27:11.097
and spent weekends
at the beach.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.473
Mom put together a group
of artists and writers...

27:13.514 --> 27:16.139
to petition for the parole
of Charles Ferry,

27:16.181 --> 27:18.139
her new pet cause.

27:18.181 --> 27:21.806
She even visited the prison and
was just appalled by the conditions.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.931
What we need are open prisons.

27:25.014 --> 27:29.932
Space. Space where the damaged
human spirit can heal.

27:30.015 --> 27:32.807
I say give them an opportunity
to participate...

27:32.890 --> 27:37.349
in decorating their own cells
with their own personal decorators.

27:37.432 --> 27:41.641
And better cuisine.
European menus.

27:41.683 --> 27:45.975
As for me, well, over the
years I was used to splitting summers up;

27:46.016 --> 27:49.475
July with Mom in New York
and August with Dad in Europe.

27:49.558 --> 27:53.225
Usually it was Paris,
but this time he took me to Venice.

27:53.308 --> 27:57.101
Well, I think he still wanted to get
over memories of Giselle dumping him.

27:57.184 --> 28:01.101
Well, all I can say is, if we're
gonna talk about romantic cities...

28:01.184 --> 28:03.767
I mean, they've got
the most gorgeous guys there...

28:03.851 --> 28:06.059
and they can't keep
their hands off you.

28:06.142 --> 28:09.309
It's great. The whole first week
was just heaven for me.

28:09.351 --> 28:12.935
I was just having a ball,
sailing around on gondolas.

28:13.018 --> 28:16.102
But Dad, well, he just seemed
to hang around the hotel.

28:16.185 --> 28:19.143
Giselle was still haunting him.

I mean, I'm having all the luck.

29:19.856 --> 29:21.815
- You should have fun.
- I am.

29:21.857 --> 29:24.357
I still can't figure out
what went wrong with Giselle.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.482
You know, I always thought
she was a little flighty.

29:27.565 --> 29:31.315
- You want a drink? I'm gonna have a beer.
- Yeah. A Bellini.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.858
- Let me give you this advice.
- Mm-hmm.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.524
In life, when a relationship breaks up
that you're in... I hope they don't...

29:38.608 --> 29:41.983
- Thank you. - It's better
to be the leaver than the "leavee."

29:42.024 --> 29:46.441
'Cause the leaver leaves, but
the "leavee" is left, and it's terrible.

29:46.524 --> 29:51.109
The worst that happens to the leaver
is a little survivor guilt,

29:51.192 --> 29:54.484
and survivor guilt is the worst thing
that should ever happen to you.

29:54.525 --> 29:57.442
Yeah? Well, tomorrow
I'll spend with you.

29:57.525 --> 30:00.109
- It's not necessary, really.
- No, it's okay.

30:00.192 --> 30:03.776
Don't turn around. That's the couple.
Don't turn around.

30:03.860 --> 30:07.943
- Who? - I told you about her.
I watched her check in the other day.

30:08.026 --> 30:11.235
She's really lovely,
but I think married.

30:11.318 --> 30:13.860
- Isn't she...
- Oh, my God!

30:13.943 --> 30:16.776
- She's beautiful, right?
- I know who she is.

30:16.860 --> 30:18.777
You're kidding?

30:18.861 --> 30:21.611
Why didn't I think of it?
She's perfect for you.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.236
How could she be perfect for me?
She's married.

30:24.319 --> 30:27.027
No, she's not happily married.
You'd love her.

30:27.111 --> 30:30.027
Tell me, who is she?
How do you know her?

30:30.111 --> 30:33.528
My friend's mother is her shrink.
I know everything about her.

30:33.612 --> 30:36.028
- You're kidding. What's her name?
- I don't know.

30:36.112 --> 30:40.237
- What do you mean, you don't know?
Stop teasing me. - I'm serious.

30:40.320 --> 30:44.070
- Who is she? - She's an art historian
and she's here to see the Tintorettos.

30:44.153 --> 30:46.821
- Yeah?
- You know what I'm thinking?

30:46.863 --> 30:49.404
- You got that look on your face.
- This is perfect.

30:49.488 --> 30:52.154
- She jogs every morning alone.
- Yeah?

30:52.238 --> 30:54.779
You could go and bump into her
and meet her.

30:54.863 --> 30:56.904
No, thank you.
She's a married woman.

30:56.988 --> 30:59.571
I'm telling you,
she's not happily married.

30:59.654 --> 31:03.489
- Mm-hmm? - Complete
mismatch. The guy's some actor.

31:03.572 --> 31:06.447
Anyway, it won't interfere
tomorrow because he sleeps late,

31:06.530 --> 31:08.447
so you'll have no problem.

31:08.530 --> 31:11.864
You can meet her. She'll definitely
be alone. I know this for a fact.

31:11.947 --> 31:13.864
It's perfect.

31:13.947 --> 31:16.448
I'm out of shape.
I can't jog. I can't do it.

31:16.531 --> 31:21.823
I haven't touched my treadmill
in weeks... 572 weeks. That's 11 years.

31:21.865 --> 31:25.282
- I wheeze. Stop looking at me like that.
- No.

31:25.365 --> 31:27.990
- I'm not gonna do this.
- We're gonna get you some jogging clothes.

31:28.032 --> 31:31.491
- She is really something.
- Tomorrow morning... you're gonna jog.

32:19.994 --> 32:22.327
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

32:22.369 --> 32:24.411
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you all right?

32:24.494 --> 32:27.578
- Yeah. - You don't happen
to know which way the Gritti is?

32:27.662 --> 32:30.703
Uh... I think it's back that way.

32:30.787 --> 32:32.703
- Over there?
- Yeah.

32:32.787 --> 32:36.787
- 'Cause jogging in Venice,
everything is so serpen... - Labyrinthine.

32:36.870 --> 32:38.787
- Labyrinthine!
- Yes. You okay?

32:38.870 --> 32:40.788
Yes, I'm fine.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.663
You gotta keep in shape.
I jog every day. You?

32:43.704 --> 32:45.829
- Yes, I do.
- You an American?

32:45.871 --> 32:49.329
- I... Yeah.
- It's a great country, isn't it?

32:49.413 --> 32:52.079
- It's beautiful.
- The mountains and the prairies.

32:52.163 --> 32:55.705
- Oh, Amer... Yeah, America. - The oceans,
you know, white with foam and everything.

32:55.789 --> 32:58.039
So...

32:58.122 --> 33:00.997
- Are you okay? You okay?
- Yes.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.289
- Sit down.
- No, I'm okay.

33:03.372 --> 33:05.164
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

33:05.247 --> 33:08.623
I have a pain in my chest
that's radiating down my arm.

33:08.706 --> 33:12.748
- That's your heart. - No. In my case,
it's stress. I get it every other day.

33:12.831 --> 33:14.456
- Okay. Breathe.
- What is your name?

33:14.540 --> 33:17.831
- Von! Oh, here you are.
- Hi.

33:17.915 --> 33:20.873
I was just giving him
directions. Are you okay?

33:20.956 --> 33:24.666
- Okay. You said you wanted to do
three miles. Come on. - You okay?

33:24.749 --> 33:26.874
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Breathe, breathe.

33:26.957 --> 33:28.832
Nice shoes.

33:28.916 --> 33:32.541
First I nearly
drop dead. I couldn't breathe.

33:32.624 --> 33:34.541
Then her husband showed up.

33:34.624 --> 33:37.208
Her husband did come, huh? That's rare.

33:37.292 --> 33:40.167
Rare? So is a coronary
thrombosis in our family.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.208
Oh, did you get her name?

33:42.292 --> 33:44.792
Von. Vonnie.

33:44.875 --> 33:48.792
Listen, she's passionate about Tintoretto.
She's working on a book about him.

33:48.875 --> 33:52.668
Obviously she's here to visit
the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

33:52.751 --> 33:55.793
I don't know what all this means.
What are all these art books?

33:55.876 --> 33:59.834
She'll be at the Scuola. He
won't. They have nothing in common.

33:59.918 --> 34:02.793
You bump into her again. Now
the groundwork's been laid.

34:02.876 --> 34:05.377
You say, " Hello.
Didn't we meet jogging?"

34:05.460 --> 34:07.794
I was the guy who had the sudden stroke.

34:07.877 --> 34:11.585
Then you impress her with your
knowledge of her favorite painter.

34:11.668 --> 34:14.793
Hey, you gotta be kidding. My
knowledge of art is limited...

34:14.877 --> 34:17.710
to Kirk Douglas as Vincent van Gogh.

34:17.793 --> 34:20.503
- What the hell do I know about this?
- Trust me, Dad.

34:20.585 --> 34:24.585
Before we leave Venice, your
lips will be pressed to hers.

34:24.670 --> 34:28.295
Yes. Unfortunately, I left
my Chapstick in New York.

34:31.003 --> 34:35.920
What is this? "The rapidity
of his brush strokes..."

34:36.004 --> 34:39.420
"Chiaroscuro outbursts of color..."

34:39.504 --> 34:42.129
I told Dad
everything I knew about Von...

34:42.212 --> 34:44.462
and he studied his Tintoretto book.

34:44.545 --> 34:48.255
I told him her likes, her
dislikes, her deepest feelings,

34:48.338 --> 34:51.797
everything from her passion for Bora
Bora and "Mahler's Fourth Symphony"...

34:51.880 --> 34:53.797
to her favorite flower:
the African daisy.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.797
I mean, it was everything.

34:55.880 --> 34:59.088
When he showed up at the
Tintoretto Museum that afternoon,

34:59.172 --> 35:03.006
he could've given a
course on the subject.

35:03.048 --> 35:07.089
- Hello again.
- Hi. Goodness.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.631
You lived. How are you? I was concerned.

35:09.714 --> 35:13.006
Oh, no, I was fine. I just
went back to the hotel before...

35:13.089 --> 35:16.257
and had the concierge...
oil my pacemaker.

35:16.340 --> 35:19.757
- - You know, I...
Incidentally, my name is Joe Berlin.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.965
Vonnie Sydell.

35:22.049 --> 35:24.465
It's a funny coincidence I see you here.

35:24.549 --> 35:28.925
You know, two New Yorkers jogging in
Venice and we bump into each other.

35:29.008 --> 35:31.800
- How did you know I was a New Yorker?
- No, I didn't.

35:31.883 --> 35:35.091
But, you know, I, like,
assumed that, you know...

35:35.175 --> 35:38.091
You're completely correct
to ask that question.

35:38.175 --> 35:41.175
It's a good question. You
should not be ashamed of it.

35:41.258 --> 35:44.467
Well, I live on 84th and Riverside.
Where in New York do you live?

35:44.551 --> 35:48.717
In Paris. Well, I-I was a New
Yorker, but now I settled in Paris.

35:48.801 --> 35:53.092
But I come back to New York all
the time 'cause I love it there.

35:53.176 --> 35:55.009
What brings you here?

35:55.092 --> 35:59.635
Oh, I wouldn't think of being in Venice
without checking out the Tintorettos,

35:59.718 --> 36:03.343
because he was... he's my
favorite... master in the world.

36:03.385 --> 36:06.010
I just adore his work.
I'm crazy about it.

36:06.052 --> 36:08.010
He was a very deep genius.

36:08.052 --> 36:12.844
The deepest. Th-The
rapidity of his brush work.

36:12.928 --> 36:16.178
Th-The chiaroscuro...
outbursts of color.

36:16.219 --> 36:19.594
His capacity for controlled gesture.

36:19.678 --> 36:24.136
Born in 1519,
only to die again in 1594,

36:24.219 --> 36:28.429
but that's... the way
it happens to most of us.

36:28.512 --> 36:31.679
So you have a real
appreciation of his work.

36:31.762 --> 36:35.679
How could I not have an appreciation
of a man who was short in stature...

36:35.720 --> 36:38.762
but with a proud and obstinate nature,

36:38.845 --> 36:43.013
who painted outside the,
the academic convention...

36:43.096 --> 36:46.846
of 16th century Venice?

36:46.930 --> 36:48.888
What do you do, Mr. Berlin?

36:48.930 --> 36:53.305
You can call me Joe. I'm-I'm-I'm
a writer. Novelist, mostly.

36:53.388 --> 36:56.431
Joe Berlin. I saw one of your books.

36:56.514 --> 36:59.847
I did. I remember it.
It had a very sexy cover.

36:59.931 --> 37:03.681
It was at the stalls on
Fifth Avenue, the 99-cent bin.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.931
Well, you know, probably... the get-acquainted price.

37:07.014 --> 37:09.098
- Oh.
- They'll do that sometimes.

37:09.182 --> 37:11.765
In the United States, I'm
considered controversial,

37:11.848 --> 37:15.348
but in Paris, where they have
an ear for literature, I...

37:15.432 --> 37:18.348
You know, they were quick
to recognize the genius...

37:18.432 --> 37:21.015
of Poe and Faulkner and myself.

37:22.641 --> 37:25.599
Well, basically, you
see, I'm a simple guy.

37:25.683 --> 37:29.766
My idea is just to live in
Paris and maybe, you know,

37:29.849 --> 37:32.141
fall in love and...

37:32.224 --> 37:35.349
and take walks, uh, in the rain...

37:35.433 --> 37:38.142
and-and, uh, listen to music,

37:38.225 --> 37:41.850
like, uh, particularly,
maybe "Mahler's Fourth."

37:43.975 --> 37:47.017
- This could be me talking. "Mahler's
Fourth" destroys me. - Could it?

37:47.100 --> 37:49.142
Ah, yes, "Mahler's Fourth," no question.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.893
I... I... See, I'm not... I'm not a, uh...

37:51.976 --> 37:54.643
what you'd call a, uh,
uh, a technology guy.

37:54.726 --> 37:57.351
- I hate technology.
- I know. I could tell by looking at you.

37:57.393 --> 37:59.893
I-I-I, uh... I'm...
I still work on...

37:59.935 --> 38:04.060
one of those old-fashioned antique
portable typewriters that-that...

38:04.143 --> 38:07.519
Are you telling me you haven't
succumbed to the cerebral computer age?

38:07.602 --> 38:10.852
You know, I'm telling
you, I like the simple life.

38:10.936 --> 38:13.394
I like to sit in my
room in Paris and write,

38:13.477 --> 38:16.977
maybe visit New York a certain
amount in the summertime.

38:17.061 --> 38:22.354
Maybe spend some time some place
romantic, like, um, Bora Bora.

38:24.312 --> 38:26.229
I... I love Bora Bora.

38:26.312 --> 38:28.937
Since the first time I went there,
I can't get it out of my mind.

38:29.020 --> 38:31.437
Well, naturally. You
know, it's beautiful.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.646
At night, the stars are so
luminous you can practically...

38:34.730 --> 38:36.646
- Read by them.
- read by them.

38:36.730 --> 38:39.688
Yes. Are you okay?

38:39.771 --> 38:44.271
A little mist appeared in your eye then.

38:44.355 --> 38:47.814
I thought you were gonna cry. I
swear, I thought you were gonna cry.

38:47.897 --> 38:49.939
No, I'm, uh... I'm okay.

38:50.022 --> 38:53.606
- Are you sure? Is something wrong?
- No, um...

38:53.689 --> 38:57.022
- What's wrong? - Nothing's wrong.
Something's so exactly right.

38:57.064 --> 38:59.022
- Yes?
- Yeah.

38:59.064 --> 39:02.315

40:24.612 --> 40:28.488
She was absolutely great. Whatever
you told me was right on the money.

40:28.571 --> 40:30.821
- I feel guilty.
- Why?

40:30.904 --> 40:35.571
Because, you know, I made her cry.
She said that she felt close to me.

40:35.654 --> 40:39.488
So? You've established a beachhead.
Now you go on and win the battle.

40:39.571 --> 40:43.697
Don't forget to blow on her back between
her shoulder blades. It makes her crazy.

40:43.780 --> 40:45.905
Hey, I'm not gonna do that.

40:45.989 --> 40:48.905
What goes on between her
and her shrink is private.

40:48.989 --> 40:52.489
What are you gonna do, give me
a map of her erogenous zones?

40:52.572 --> 40:55.990
- Dad, are you seeing her tonight?
- No, she's married!

40:56.073 --> 41:00.490
Listen, I'm not that guy. I don't
know Bora Bora from Walla Walla.

41:00.573 --> 41:02.990
What the hell do I
know about Tintoretto?

41:03.073 --> 41:06.740
I can't tell the difference between
his chiaroscuro and his segretto sauce.

41:06.823 --> 41:09.491
Don't forget to blow
between her shoulder blades.

41:09.574 --> 41:11.991
I'm not gonna blow between
her shoulder blades.

41:12.074 --> 41:14.824
Plus, I use a word
processor, not a typewriter.

41:14.907 --> 41:19.032
I hope you have something great to wear
tonight, 'cause we're going to a party.

41:19.116 --> 41:21.074
A party? I...

41:21.116 --> 41:23.533
I wanna introduce you to someone.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.992
Dad.

41:29.075 --> 41:30.950
This is Alberto.

41:31.033 --> 41:33.200
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

41:33.242 --> 41:35.533
Who are all these people? This is, uh...

41:35.575 --> 41:39.159
- Venetians. Friends, guests in town.
- Yes?

41:39.243 --> 41:41.701
Did your enjoy your staying in Venice?

41:41.743 --> 41:44.409
Fabulous. It's the best. Absolutely
the best. She'll tell you.

41:44.493 --> 41:48.409
Dad, I wanted you to meet Alberto because
I think you should be the first to know:

41:48.493 --> 41:50.409
We're getting married.

41:50.493 --> 41:53.160
Wonderful. Let me know what
century, I'll rent a tux.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.077
This January.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.160
- Pardon me?
- This January.

41:57.244 --> 42:00.077
This January.
You're joking, of course.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.369
I am in love with Djuna.

42:02.452 --> 42:05.202
We all love this little
girl because she's adorable.

42:05.244 --> 42:07.953
But... But you are... This is a jest.

42:08.036 --> 42:12.870
It is January 15, to be exact.
It's his mother's birthday.

42:12.911 --> 42:17.286
- A joke. A jest, right? Am I right?
- Not at all.

42:17.370 --> 42:19.411
Excuse... Excuse me one second. Come on.

42:19.496 --> 42:23.996
I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Come
over here. Just for a second. Right here.

42:24.079 --> 42:27.412
What are you talking about?
Tell me this is a joke.

42:27.496 --> 42:29.412
Otherwise, there's gonna be carnage.

42:29.496 --> 42:31.746
We're crazy about each other.

42:31.829 --> 42:36.038
How can you be crazy... You
met this guy... five days ago.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.705
- So? - What do you mean, so?
Are you having a breakdown?

42:38.747 --> 42:40.705
Why, because I'm in love?

42:40.747 --> 42:43.538
What do you mean, you're in
love? With what? What does he do?

42:43.580 --> 42:46.247
- He's a gondolier.
- A... No, thank you.

42:46.330 --> 42:49.498
- He's one of those guys with the
striped shirt and the hat? - No hat.

42:49.581 --> 42:52.373
- What do you mean, no hat?
- He doesn't wear a hat.

42:52.414 --> 42:55.873
This is crazy. What are
you, you know... Talk to me.

42:55.914 --> 42:59.248
- Are you gonna... Are you talking
about getting married? - Yes.

42:59.331 --> 43:01.248
- That's insanity.
- Why is it insanity?

43:01.331 --> 43:04.790
Because you have to go to school.
You're gonna go back to Columbia.

43:04.874 --> 43:08.124
You're gonna major in journalism
or law, not... not rowing.

43:08.207 --> 43:11.624
People have dropped out of
Columbia before. It's been done.

43:11.707 --> 43:14.707
You are not going to
run off with a guy...

43:14.790 --> 43:17.333
who you just met and who's a gondolier.

43:17.416 --> 43:19.541
- He's a poet.
- He's a poet?

43:19.583 --> 43:22.916
Let me tell you what rhymes
with gondolier: no lira.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.166
- Okay? So, forget it.
- Oh, God, Dad.

43:32.667 --> 43:35.542
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello, again.

43:35.584 --> 43:39.126
- My God, what a coincidence.
- This is, uh... Joe, Greg.

43:39.209 --> 43:41.042
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hi.

43:41.126 --> 43:44.960
- Were you... You were running this
morning... with the heart? - That was me.

43:45.043 --> 43:47.293
Have you seen Bernardo
Bertolucci? Is he here?

43:47.377 --> 43:50.377
I wouldn't recognize him
'cause it's a madhouse in there.

43:50.460 --> 43:53.960
- Do you mind if I go ahead? If you want
to talk. Okay. - It's an absolute madhouse.

43:54.043 --> 43:55.960
I'll get you a drink.

43:56.043 --> 43:58.127
- Incredible. I mean...
- Is it?

43:58.210 --> 44:02.211
Have you seen this place? I was
just going home. It's unbelievable.

44:02.294 --> 44:07.044
- They have a... The whole thing is like
it's an old palazzo. - Oh, wow.

44:07.128 --> 44:09.253
And it's really, really beautiful.

44:09.336 --> 44:11.544
But, you know, frantic in there.

44:11.628 --> 44:13.754
- Hey, you look great.
- Oh.

44:13.837 --> 44:16.420
I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

44:16.504 --> 44:19.879
- Why?
- I don't know. I can't take a compliment.

44:19.962 --> 44:22.629
You look terrific. Why not? I'm sorry.

44:22.712 --> 44:25.420
No, it's my problem.

44:25.504 --> 44:29.213
- Why? Does it make you feel guilty?
- Uh, maybe. I don't know.

44:29.255 --> 44:31.838
You seem to have all
the answers, don't you?

44:31.921 --> 44:34.213
I think it makes you feel guilty.

44:34.296 --> 44:38.963
I think that you must have fantasies
of maybe somebody coming along that...

44:39.046 --> 44:42.881
You probably have dreams about boats...

44:42.964 --> 44:45.089
or... ships, maybe,

44:45.172 --> 44:49.839
or maybe even, you know,
like an elevator that...

44:49.922 --> 44:53.422
You're on an elevator and it goes
higher and higher to the top floor...

44:53.506 --> 44:56.090
and then it doesn't stop at the top,

44:56.173 --> 44:58.507
it just goes right through the roof...

44:58.590 --> 45:01.840
and it just sort of
flies you over the ocean.

45:03.923 --> 45:06.840
I think I'm gonna faint. I do.

45:08.173 --> 45:10.174
- Are you okay?
- Uh, uh, no.

45:10.258 --> 45:13.133
I'm... I'm a little overwhelmed...

45:13.216 --> 45:16.883
and I'm glad you're leaving tomorrow.

45:39.635 --> 45:42.177
The next
morning, we left Venice.

45:42.260 --> 45:45.427
Dad made a flight to Paris
and I went to New York.

45:45.510 --> 45:48.552
I couldn't wait to tell
Mom about marrying Alberto.

45:48.635 --> 45:51.218
He was so beautiful, so sensitive.

45:51.302 --> 45:55.594
My plan was to drop out of Columbia
after the fall term and move to Italy.

45:57.761 --> 46:00.678
- Uh, excuse me. That's mine.
- No, it's...

46:00.761 --> 46:02.719
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

46:02.803 --> 46:05.178
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's not mine.

46:05.261 --> 46:08.679
- It's okay. We both like shopping
at Hunting World. - That's where I got it.

46:08.762 --> 46:11.679
- Oh, God, now I know it's mine.
- It's all right. I'll give you a hand.

46:11.762 --> 46:13.845
- Thanks.
- Um... your bra.

46:13.929 --> 46:16.762
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Underwear.

46:16.845 --> 46:18.887
Petrarch's sonnets. What do you do?

46:18.970 --> 46:22.221
Um, depends who the guy
is. No, just kidding.

46:22.305 --> 46:26.555
Um, I actua... 'Cause I work
for the Colombian drug cartel.

46:26.596 --> 46:29.555
- Yeah, I gift wrap
the cocaine. - Mm-hmm.

46:29.596 --> 46:32.763
Why am I so nervous? I'm
a student at Columbia.

46:32.846 --> 46:35.306
- Oh, is that right? My uncle teaches there.
- No.

46:35.389 --> 46:38.972
Yeah. Math Department.
I'm, uh, Ken Grisley.

46:39.056 --> 46:41.139
Djuna Berlin.

46:41.222 --> 46:44.556
Did I really want
to spend my life making pasta...

46:44.597 --> 46:46.972
and riding around in gondolas?

46:47.056 --> 46:50.265
To tell you the truth, those
canals are awfully polluted.

46:50.348 --> 46:52.473
I mean, Alberto was cute,

46:52.557 --> 46:55.723
but Ken was... hot.

46:56.932 --> 47:00.223
♪ Cuddle up a little closer ♪

47:01.307 --> 47:03.849

48:15.479 --> 48:18.646
While I'd been
away, an awful lot had happened.

48:18.729 --> 48:21.938
Mom bought Skylar a
drop-dead wedding dress,

48:22.021 --> 48:24.979
and Holden's father and
my stepdad became friends.

48:25.063 --> 48:28.022
They discovered a common
interest: horse racing.

48:28.105 --> 48:30.730
So, they chipped in and
bought a thoroughbred.

48:30.772 --> 48:33.897
And Lane and Laura had a
great time at the beach.

48:33.980 --> 48:38.022
But one hot summer weekend, with
everyone else in New York away,

48:38.105 --> 48:40.647
they found themselves in town.

49:00.191 --> 49:02.899
- So, we're probably the only ones left
in the city this weekend. - Yeah.

49:02.982 --> 49:07.274
We usually go to South Hampton, but
this weekend we had tickets to a show.

49:07.357 --> 49:10.942
I love the city when it's empty.

49:11.025 --> 49:12.942
- Me too.
- Me too.

49:14.733 --> 49:18.233
To make a long
story short, they've all become close.

49:18.317 --> 49:22.192
His name... if you can believe
it... is Jeffrey Vandermost,

49:22.275 --> 49:24.609
and he's heir to the
Vandermost millions.

49:24.693 --> 49:28.984
Meanwhile, they're both in love with him,
and one of them's heading for a broken heart.

49:30.609 --> 49:33.526
Fall was
particularly beautiful this year.

49:33.609 --> 49:36.526
I think I like it even
better than spring,

49:36.609 --> 49:39.569
and with October comes Mom's birthday.

49:39.652 --> 49:43.110
This year we invited Holden's
parents over to celebrate,

49:43.194 --> 49:46.902
but just before they arrived
we had an unexpected visitor.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.902
That's a gorgeous color.

49:48.985 --> 49:50.902
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, sweetie.

49:50.985 --> 49:53.903
- These are from your ex-husband,
my biological father. - Oh! Joe!

49:53.986 --> 49:56.903
- Oh, look, everybody!
- You know what that is? That's caviar.

49:56.986 --> 50:00.445
Frieda, could you put this on
ice? Nothing like sturgeon eggs.

50:00.486 --> 50:02.403
- Are you expecting Mr. Ferry?
- I am, yes.

50:02.486 --> 50:04.403
- You are?
- Charles Ferry?

50:04.486 --> 50:07.404
He just got out of prison. He has
no family. I figured, you know...

50:07.487 --> 50:09.404
- So he can join our family?
- What?

50:09.487 --> 50:13.404
- You're letting a criminal come into this
house? - He's paid his debt to society.

50:13.487 --> 50:15.904
Don't start. I don't wanna hear this.

50:15.987 --> 50:19.904
No! Society forgave him his debts.
He did not pay his debt to society.

50:19.987 --> 50:23.447
How did I wind up with a kid on the other
end of the political spectrum from me?

50:23.488 --> 50:25.905
- Where did I fail?
- You didn't fail, Dad.

50:25.988 --> 50:28.905
- If I was you, I'd start hiding the
silverware. - Don't be rude, Scott.

50:28.988 --> 50:31.905
He's coming over for just a drink.

50:31.988 --> 50:33.905
You guys have everything.

50:33.988 --> 50:37.573
Mr. Ferry, hi. I'm... I'm Bob
Dandridge. This is my wife Steffi.

50:37.656 --> 50:40.573
Hello, Mr. Ferry. Welcome
to our home. Welcome.

50:40.656 --> 50:43.573
I'd like you to meet my daughter Skylar.

50:43.656 --> 50:46.073
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- This is Skylar and her fiance Holden.

50:46.156 --> 50:48.073
I'm... I'm the fiance.

50:48.156 --> 50:51.157
- Uh, can I get you something to dr...
- Nobody gets behind me.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.157
Right. Okay. Sure.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.365
- Uh, can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, vodka.

50:56.449 --> 50:59.365
Right. Maybe, uh, on
the... Uh, or, or...

50:59.449 --> 51:01.365
- Maybe right in the arm.
- Just... Just...

51:01.449 --> 51:03.866
I'll, I'll get you a... Straight up.

51:03.950 --> 51:05.866
Honey, Mr. Perr... Mr. Ferry. Sorry.

51:05.950 --> 51:10.033
Uh, he's been living amongst vicious
killers. No wonder he's skittish.

51:10.116 --> 51:13.033
- A lot of times a guy'll come up
behind ya and... Swish! - "Swish"?

51:13.116 --> 51:16.033
You get your blade out quick, you
stick it in him, or you're dead.

51:16.116 --> 51:18.034
- Ahh.
- The blade. The blade.

51:18.117 --> 51:21.034
H-Have you stuck a lot of
other inmates, Mr. Ferry?

51:21.117 --> 51:23.034
Enough.

51:23.117 --> 51:25.034
- Uh, the d... the doorbell.
- That's enough for me.

51:25.117 --> 51:27.034
- How many is "enough"?
- How is that?

51:27.117 --> 51:29.534
- Would you like another one?
- Oh, it's your parents.

51:29.617 --> 51:31.868
- Hi! Hello. How are you?
- Ohh!

51:31.952 --> 51:33.868
- Good to see you, dear.
- Hi, Arnold.

51:33.952 --> 51:37.368
- Happy birthday, Steffi.
- Oh, thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.

51:37.452 --> 51:40.368
Hi, Arnold. I have
someone I want you to meet.

51:40.452 --> 51:43.368
Mr. Ferry. Mr. Ferry. I'd
like you to meet Mr. Ferry.

51:43.452 --> 51:45.869
This is my good friend Lynn.

51:45.953 --> 51:47.869
- And this is Arnold.
- I must say...

51:47.953 --> 51:50.869
- Mr. Ferry is just out of prison.
- Yes, I'm aware.

51:50.953 --> 51:54.369
I'm lucky the parole came through, but
I was gonna get out one way or the other.

51:54.453 --> 51:56.994
- What exactly does that mean?
- Ice the guard.

51:57.078 --> 51:58.994
- No pictures, sister.
- I'm sorry.

51:59.078 --> 52:01.495
What do you mean, "ice the guard"?

52:01.579 --> 52:03.995
- Get out through the ventilation shaft.
- Ice. Really?

52:04.079 --> 52:07.495
Come up behind him with a box
cutter, rip out his carotid artery.

52:07.579 --> 52:09.495
- Oh.
- What's a box cutter?

52:09.579 --> 52:12.495
- May I have a glass of white wine?
- We have white wine.

52:12.579 --> 52:14.496
You gotta be careful, though.

52:14.580 --> 52:17.996
Guy on cell block four tried it,
didn't have all the angles figured.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.997
- Got his tit caught in the wringer.
- His tit? Really?

52:21.080 --> 52:24.122
- Oh, uh, the terrace.
- Let's go up to the terrace.

52:24.205 --> 52:27.122
- Good idea. Let's get some
wine. - Big, wide-open spaces.

52:27.205 --> 52:29.123
Are you sure this guy is rehabilitated?

52:29.206 --> 52:32.123
Honey, he was in prison,
not a finishing school.

52:32.206 --> 52:34.123
Well, you know my sentiments,

52:34.206 --> 52:36.123
but very happy birthday.

52:36.206 --> 52:38.248

Sweetie.

54:07.921 --> 54:09.838
- Ohh.
- Is that okay?

54:09.921 --> 54:11.838
Okay? Honey.

54:11.921 --> 54:14.838
- I'm gonna grab a few drinks.
You want anything? - No, thanks.

54:14.921 --> 54:18.338
But before you do, would you get Steffi's
present for me? I left it in the car.

54:18.421 --> 54:21.631
- Oh, yeah.
- Holden, here.

54:22.964 --> 54:25.422
Are you enjoying the view?

54:25.464 --> 54:28.797
I like any view after years and
years in that stinkin' rat hole.

54:28.881 --> 54:31.172
Oh. That's very vividly put.

54:31.256 --> 54:33.172
S-Sweetly honest.

54:33.256 --> 54:36.173
You know what it's like
in solitary confinement?

54:36.257 --> 54:38.673
No, I can't say that I do.

54:38.757 --> 54:41.673
I went to N.Y.U. I didn't
even stay in the dorm.

54:41.757 --> 54:45.673
- You know how long it is since I smelled
perfume? - Oh, do I have too much on?

54:45.757 --> 54:49.173
No, to me you smell like what
I think heaven would smell like.

54:49.257 --> 54:51.674
Oh. Well, thank you. That's really nice.

54:51.758 --> 54:56.424
When you shook my hand before, I
thought my heart was gonna stop.

54:56.508 --> 54:58.424
Oh, that's sweet.

54:58.508 --> 55:01.924
Uh, but remember, you've been
very deprived of female contact.

55:02.008 --> 55:05.425
I used to lie in my cell at night
and dream of somebody like you.

55:05.509 --> 55:07.759
Yeah.

55:07.842 --> 55:11.259
Oh, uh, I took, um, a
criminology class in college.

55:11.300 --> 55:13.925
- A very insight...
- You have very sensual lips.

55:14.009 --> 55:17.759
Oh. O-Oh, well, i-it's a
part of me I rarely think of.

55:17.800 --> 55:21.135
- Can I smell your hair?
- You wanna smell my hair?

55:21.218 --> 55:24.926
Okay. You know what? It's
gonna be all gone soon.

55:25.010 --> 55:28.426
I was thinking of cutting it. I
think Holden might like it short.

55:28.510 --> 55:31.426
You know what I would
do if you were my girl?

55:31.510 --> 55:33.761
It's a little chilly outside.

55:33.844 --> 55:37.761
- Maybe I should get a shawl. - I would
make love to you in every room in the house.

55:39.136 --> 55:41.552
On every bed.

55:41.594 --> 55:44.052
On every rug.

55:44.136 --> 55:46.887
On every tabletop.

55:46.970 --> 55:50.887
We also have some lovely
early American chandeliers.

55:52.428 --> 55:54.387
Let's go for a drive.

55:56.303 --> 55:59.762
Um, no. I don't think that
that would be such a good idea.

55:59.803 --> 56:03.763
I haven't seen the ocean or been
up to Harlem or Chinatown in years.

56:03.846 --> 56:06.179
Oh, no, i-it's out of the question.

56:06.263 --> 56:09.638
- Okay, but you can't blame me for tryin'.
- No.

56:09.721 --> 56:12.638
I think that we should
get back inside before...

56:12.721 --> 56:14.638
Before what?

56:14.721 --> 56:17.139
Before you break your parole.

56:17.222 --> 56:22.139
If I took you in my arms and kissed
you right now, would you dime on me?

56:22.222 --> 56:24.680
- "Dime"?
- Turn me in.

56:24.764 --> 56:27.389
Oh. Let's not find out.

56:27.430 --> 56:29.390
Mmm.

56:39.806 --> 56:41.806
How was it?

56:41.890 --> 56:43.807
Uh...

56:45.891 --> 56:48.557
Very interesting.

56:48.599 --> 56:52.057
I've never been kissed
by a sociopath before.

56:53.224 --> 56:55.849
I kissed you the best I could,

56:55.932 --> 56:58.850
considering the only practice I
had kissing in the last 10 years...

56:58.933 --> 57:00.850
is with Vincent "The Thumb" Adatto.

57:12.101 --> 57:14.018
Jeez.

57:14.101 --> 57:17.018
Vincent "The Thumb" doesn't
know what he's missing.

57:18.601 --> 57:20.559
Can I see you again?

57:20.601 --> 57:22.559
Well...

57:24.559 --> 57:26.977
You know, I'm getting married.

59:05.026 --> 59:07.942
He's en route to New York now,

59:08.026 --> 59:09.942
and he's wonderful.

59:10.026 --> 59:12.442
It's been, like, a chance meeting,

59:12.526 --> 59:15.442
after all these years,
with a true soul mate.

59:15.526 --> 59:17.442
He senses my every need.

59:17.526 --> 59:19.943
It's like he knows what I'm thinking.

59:20.027 --> 59:22.610
- It's like your fantasy come true.
- I... It is.

59:22.694 --> 59:25.194
I-I still can't believe it.

59:25.277 --> 59:29.235
You know, it's... it's not
that he's tall or handsome,

59:29.319 --> 59:32.610
but he's, um... he's magical.

59:32.694 --> 59:37.236
And he feels me in a way
that no man ever has before.

59:37.320 --> 59:41.570
It's... He's romantic and he's sexy.

59:41.611 --> 59:44.903
I had this dream that
I was in bed with him...

59:44.986 --> 59:48.279
and he was kissing my earlobes...

59:48.362 --> 59:52.404
and then he started
stroking my shoulder blades.

59:52.487 --> 59:55.071
I nearly had an orgasm.

59:55.154 --> 59:58.071
I had lots
of neat stuff to tell Dad.

59:58.154 --> 01:00:00.987
He'd really made a big score with Von.

01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:03.988
But now I've got to stop for a minute,

01:00:04.072 --> 01:00:07.322
because as much as we humans
like to think we control things,

01:00:07.405 --> 01:00:09.822
that's not the way it works.

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:13.322
Suddenly, with no warning, Grandpa died.

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:17.323
It was in his sleep,
peaceful, with no suffering,

01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:19.989
but it made philosophers of all of us.

01:00:20.073 --> 01:00:22.989
When your number is
up, your number is up.

01:00:23.073 --> 01:00:25.323
That's why it's very important...

01:00:25.406 --> 01:00:27.489
that we cherish each moment,

01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:29.782
each moment of our lives,

01:00:29.824 --> 01:00:31.782
and not smoke.

01:00:31.824 --> 01:00:33.782
Smoke?

01:00:33.824 --> 01:00:37.782
Wh... I mean, he... Pop
smoked for 70 years, you know.

01:00:37.824 --> 01:00:40.282
- Well...
- He never exercised. He ate everything.

01:00:40.324 --> 01:00:43.282
He ate cholesterol and, and fatty foods.

01:00:43.324 --> 01:00:45.783
He died at a healthy, ripe old age.

01:00:45.825 --> 01:00:48.783
I haven't had steak in
so long. I love steak.

01:00:48.825 --> 01:00:51.283
- Now you got him talking about food.
- Disgusting.

01:00:51.325 --> 01:00:53.783
I'd kill for some marbleized meat.

01:00:53.825 --> 01:00:58.951
They say six cups of coffee a day
prevents, like, prevents colon cancer.

01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:01.909
Last week it was bad for you.

01:01:01.951 --> 01:01:05.034
What's it all about? I mean...

01:01:05.117 --> 01:01:08.034
What are we doing? We're
rushing, we're rushing.

01:01:08.117 --> 01:01:10.034
- Th-That's right.
- Where are we going?

01:01:10.117 --> 01:01:13.035
- They're so old.
- Into the void.

01:01:13.118 --> 01:01:16.077
That's it. The void is it, you
know. I never believed in God.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.118
- Oh...
- No, I didn't, not even as a little kid.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.618
I used to think... I remember this...

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.118
...even if He exists, He's done
such a terrible job, - Dad!

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.119
it's a wonder people don't file
a class action suit against Him.

01:01:28.161 --> 01:01:30.119
You shouldn't be talking about...

01:01:30.161 --> 01:01:33.119
There's gotta be some reason we're
here. It can't just be the new physics.

01:01:33.161 --> 01:01:35.119
You gotta believe in something.

01:01:35.161 --> 01:01:37.119
The dignity of Man.

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:40.119
The flat tax, the right to
bear arms and school prayer.

01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:43.120
- If there's nobody out there,
who are they praying to? - Stop fighting.

01:01:43.162 --> 01:01:45.120
Please don't.

01:01:45.162 --> 01:01:48.954
- Please don't start arguing in
front of Grandpa. - I can't believe you.

01:01:48.995 --> 01:01:52.537
Wait a minute. He wasn't an
atheist. He wasn't a Republican.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.621
- He wasn't even a Democrat.
- Well, Mom, he must've been something.

01:01:55.705 --> 01:01:57.955
- He was a foot fetishist.
- Yeah.

01:01:58.038 --> 01:02:00.955
- It's the only group I remember
him belonging to. - That's true.

01:02:01.038 --> 01:02:02.955
He drove your mother crazy.

01:02:03.038 --> 01:02:06.080
Pop, is that you?

01:02:06.163 --> 01:02:08.580
I've got just one message for you.

01:02:08.621 --> 01:02:13.039
You work and work for years and
years, you're always on the go.

01:02:13.122 --> 01:02:17.122
You never take a minute
off. Too busy makin' dough.

Well,
actually, it wasn't perfect.

01:04:34.924 --> 01:04:39.091
There was a moment in there when I
stroked when I should have hickeyed,

01:04:39.132 --> 01:04:41.757
but, you know, I apologize.

01:04:41.799 --> 01:04:43.757

I feel limp.

01:04:45.967 --> 01:04:49.508
You know, I'd really love
you to come to Paris with me.

01:04:49.592 --> 01:04:51.508
- I'm serious.
- Yeah?

01:04:51.592 --> 01:04:53.508
Paris?

01:04:53.592 --> 01:04:55.508
And then Bora Bora.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:58.508
Well, well, yes, Bora
Bora, but Paris first.

01:04:58.592 --> 01:05:01.593
Then we'd work our way down
to a least one of the Boras.

01:05:01.634 --> 01:05:04.259
We can live in your garret.

01:05:04.343 --> 01:05:07.343
Uh, t-technically,
w-when I say "garret"...

01:05:07.426 --> 01:05:09.593
I.. It's funny. It is a garret, and yet...

01:05:09.634 --> 01:05:13.052
- And drink wine and eat snails
'til the dawn comes up. - Snails?

01:05:13.135 --> 01:05:15.552
Yeah. Remember?

01:05:15.635 --> 01:05:19.052
You said how you also loved waking
up in the middle of the night,

01:05:19.135 --> 01:05:22.052
...sitting in bed eating snails,
drinking wine. - Yes, yes. Yes.

01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:24.302
I said it was such a great coincidence.

01:05:24.385 --> 01:05:26.302
Well, they're... they're mollusks.

01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:28.303
I-I-I love, uh,
a good mollusk.

01:05:29.886 --> 01:05:32.803
W-W-What do you mean,
the wedding is off?

01:05:32.886 --> 01:05:36.011
- Exactly what I said. I gave back his ring.
- Why?

01:05:36.095 --> 01:05:39.511
Because there's someone else
I can't get out of my mind.

01:05:39.595 --> 01:05:42.512
- But y-you're in love with
Holden! - No, Dad, I'm not.

01:05:42.596 --> 01:05:46.512
At least I'm not sure I am, and I can't
cheat on him while I figure it out.

01:05:46.596 --> 01:05:49.512
- Cheat on Holden? He's gonna
be your husband! - No, Dad!

01:05:49.596 --> 01:05:53.512
- In November. I'll show you. I got receipts from
caterers. - Bob, calm your denial mechanism.

01:05:53.596 --> 01:05:55.513
It's not that Holden isn't wonderful.

01:05:55.597 --> 01:05:59.013
It's just that somebody else has come
into my life and I must see where it goes.

01:05:59.097 --> 01:06:01.972
- It wouldn't be fair to Holden if I didn't.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

01:06:02.013 --> 01:06:04.972
Now that we've bought you
this fabulous wedding dress,

01:06:05.013 --> 01:06:08.472
would you mind telling me who this new
Prince Charming is that suddenly emerged?

01:06:08.513 --> 01:06:11.473
- Well, you don't kn... You do, but not
like I do. - I'm sick.

01:06:11.514 --> 01:06:14.973
- Honey, what's the matter?
- My esophagus is going into spasms.

01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:18.473
- If my necktie goes up and down...
- Look what you're doing to your father.

01:06:18.514 --> 01:06:21.473
Tell me who has come
between you and Holden.

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:23.974
- Well, he's bright and charming...
- Yeah?

01:06:24.016 --> 01:06:26.974
and rough to the outside,
but that can change.

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:30.349
- Are you gonna tell us, or is this
like a game show? -

01:06:30.432 --> 01:06:32.349
You remember Charles Ferry?

01:06:32.432 --> 01:06:34.349
- Pardon me?
- Charles Ferry.

01:06:34.432 --> 01:06:37.349
For a minute I thought
she said Charles Ferry.

01:06:37.432 --> 01:06:40.350
- Now my esophagus is starting to move.
- Charles Ferry?

01:06:40.433 --> 01:06:42.350
- Honey!
- The escaped convict?

01:06:42.433 --> 01:06:45.350
- Skylar! - Ex-convict.
He has a college degree.

01:06:45.433 --> 01:06:47.350
No, Skylar, let me tell you something.

01:06:47.433 --> 01:06:50.350
You're having a psychotic
episode. You need help!

01:06:50.433 --> 01:06:53.351
- You need shock treatment, or
industrial-strength Prozac. - Calm down.

01:06:53.434 --> 01:06:55.351
Mom, you understand.

01:06:55.434 --> 01:06:58.351
There is something incredibly
animalistic about him.

01:06:58.434 --> 01:07:00.851
- We'll turn him over to the zoo.
- Oh, honey.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:04.351
- And yet he's like a child.
- Okay, we'll make it the children's zoo.

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:06.852
- He's a criminal!
- Mom, I'm shocked.

01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:09.852
You've done nothing but
sing his praises for months.

01:07:09.935 --> 01:07:11.852
Well, yes, as a social symbol.

01:07:11.935 --> 01:07:14.852
But as an actual person
to be with my child?

01:07:14.935 --> 01:07:18.644
- How are you going to go out with this man?
- Guys, get out of here.

01:07:18.727 --> 01:07:21.145
You can't get behind
him. He won't let you!

01:07:21.228 --> 01:07:23.645
You try to scratch his
back, he'll knife you!

01:07:23.728 --> 01:07:26.645
Under all that veneer
is a very soulful young attorney.

01:07:26.728 --> 01:07:29.645
In fact, I was hoping you might
find a place for him in your firm.

01:07:29.728 --> 01:07:32.645
I'll make him treasurer.
He can share a room with Holden.

01:07:32.728 --> 01:07:35.646
Speaking as a woman, Holden
can be very animal too.

01:07:35.729 --> 01:07:38.646
- Yes, Mom, but it's of the gerbil family.
- Oh, that's not...

01:07:38.729 --> 01:07:41.646
- Get out of here!
- As your father, I forbid you...

01:07:41.729 --> 01:07:43.646
to see this man Charles Ferry.

01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:45.646
You will marry Holden as planned.

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:49.272
As head of this house, I
command it! I decree it!

01:07:49.313 --> 01:07:51.272
Thou shalt wed thy intended!

01:07:51.313 --> 01:07:53.438
- Okay, come on, let's have...
- That's it.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.772
Let's get a drink. You're
sounding tiresomely Biblical.

01:07:56.813 --> 01:08:00.688
"Tiresomely Biblical"? What is
this, Noel Coward with hockey?

01:08:00.772 --> 01:08:04.189
- She's not gonna waste her life like this
on a gangster. - Oh, she's a grown woman!

01:08:04.273 --> 01:08:06.189
- You!
- What?

01:08:06.273 --> 01:08:09.189
- You got him out of jail!
- This is my fault now?

01:08:09.273 --> 01:08:11.981
Honey, what? What's wrong?

01:08:12.023 --> 01:08:15.481
Jeffrey Vandermost asked
Lane out and not me.

01:08:15.523 --> 01:08:17.482
- Ohh.
- Oh, my God!

01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:20.482
How am I gonna face
Arnold and Lynn Spence?

01:08:20.524 --> 01:08:22.482
Is that all you're thinking about?

01:08:22.524 --> 01:08:24.482
We bought a race horse together.

01:08:24.524 --> 01:08:26.982
He's gonna want to cut it in half!

01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:29.982
We both liked him, and today
he asked if we could talk alone,

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:31.983
so I got all excited.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.649
And then he asked me if I thought
Lane would go out with him...

01:08:35.733 --> 01:08:38.149
if he asked her to a
dance in Connecticut...

01:08:38.233 --> 01:08:40.649
and that he had a mad crush on her.

01:08:40.733 --> 01:08:44.149

Um, Charles, where did you get
the money to pay for everything,

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:23.073
and... and this car?

01:10:23.157 --> 01:10:27.033
Uh, well, you know, loans.

01:10:28.533 --> 01:10:32.616
Oh, this is a great idea to
take a walk here. It's beautiful.

01:10:32.658 --> 01:10:34.783
Yeah, yeah. What time is it?

01:10:34.824 --> 01:10:36.783

01:10:36.824 --> 01:10:38.784
Oh, good.

01:10:38.825 --> 01:10:43.617
I just thought you'd wanna walk
around a little, see the fall leaves.

01:10:43.659 --> 01:10:45.617
Oh, they are stunning.

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:48.117
It's amazing what you miss in the joint.

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:51.117
There's no seasons. It's
just one long, gray nothin'.

01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:53.118
What are your plans for the future?

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.618
- I can't imagine you'd wanna work in the
restaurant forever. - You're right.

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.243
Work all day for what? A few
lousy bucks. I got bigger plans.

01:11:00.326 --> 01:11:03.493
- Like pursuing a law career.
- What?

01:11:03.535 --> 01:11:05.493
A lawyer?

01:11:05.535 --> 01:11:07.494
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

01:11:09.536 --> 01:11:11.911
- You hear somethin'?
- A bird?

01:11:13.994 --> 01:11:16.411
All right, here they
come. Timing's perfect.

01:11:16.494 --> 01:11:18.911
- Move it!
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

01:11:18.994 --> 01:11:21.912
What do you want me to do, put
a pole up my ass? I'm goin'!

01:11:23.995 --> 01:11:26.912
- Back in action!
- Way to go, Ferry!

01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:30.037
- You got anything lined up?
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.037
- Who's she?
- She's a friend.

01:11:37.163 --> 01:11:40.121
Why'd you have to shoot?
You didn't have to shoot!

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:43.121
- He was emptyin' the register!
- I got nervous!

01:11:43.163 --> 01:11:46.746
Charles, just let me out
at the corner of Park and 93rd.

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:54.247
Charles, let me out of this car!

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.247
I want out of this car!

01:11:59.164 --> 01:12:01.622
I will be quiet! Just let me out!

01:12:01.664 --> 01:12:05.123
Shut her up, or I'll shut her up!

01:12:07.165 --> 01:12:09.123
Get out!

01:12:20.499 --> 01:12:24.457
In October, Von
finally got up the nerve and left Greg.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:28.207
She bought a ticket on Air France
and took the first plane to Paris.

01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:30.874
By this time Dad had given up
his flat on the Left Bank...

01:12:30.957 --> 01:12:32.875
and moved into a place...

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:36.875
he knew would be straight out of
Von's fantasy of a Parisian apartment.

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:38.875
In addition to taking guitar lessons,

01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:42.125
he traded in his word processor
for an old portable typewriter.

01:12:42.167 --> 01:12:44.125
Hi.

01:12:44.167 --> 01:12:46.126
Ahh!

01:12:47.376 --> 01:12:50.001
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

out of a dr... This is, like, my dream.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.669

New York, it was Halloween.

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:10.335

01:14:47.384 --> 01:14:49.343
- I was worried.
- Oh, yes!

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:53.176
- I'm... Holden, I'm so sorry.
- No, shh. It doesn't...

01:14:53.259 --> 01:14:56.177
Mmm. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.802
- Oh, I behaved so terribly.
- No, no, really, it was... it was me too.

01:14:59.844 --> 01:15:01.802
- No, it wasn't.
- I missed you.

01:15:01.844 --> 01:15:03.802
- I really missed you.
- I missed you too.

01:15:03.844 --> 01:15:05.802
I brought you Cracker Jacks.

01:15:05.844 --> 01:15:08.803
Holden was so
much in love with my sister...

01:15:08.845 --> 01:15:11.803
that it didn't mean a thing that
she had given him a hard time.

01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:14.803
Mom and Dad were so glad
to see them reunited.

01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:17.303
He gave her back the diamond ring,

01:15:17.345 --> 01:15:21.303
only he wanted to be romantic, so he
put it in a box of Cracker Jacks...

01:15:21.345 --> 01:15:24.137
and she swallowed it again.

01:15:24.179 --> 01:15:27.679
The rest of fall was
pretty normal... for us.

01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:30.512
The only glitch we had
was on Thanksgiving.

01:15:30.554 --> 01:15:33.887
Just after dinner,
Scott suddenly collapsed.

01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:35.887
Everybody panicked.

01:15:35.972 --> 01:15:38.388
There's nothing to be alarmed about.

01:15:38.472 --> 01:15:42.680
There was blockage in an artery, but
it's all been dissolved, so he's fine.

01:15:42.722 --> 01:15:46.180
- He's totally fine? There's no problem?
- Oh, no. Hundred percent.

01:15:46.222 --> 01:15:50.681
Our scan indicated that the condition
occurred some time ago, perhaps a year,

01:15:50.723 --> 01:15:54.681
so if he's exhibited any
strange or weird behavior,

01:15:54.723 --> 01:15:58.806
it's probably because his brain
wasn't getting enough oxygen.

01:15:58.889 --> 01:16:00.764
And
wouldn't you know it,

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:03.764
as soon as his brain
started functioning properly,

01:16:03.848 --> 01:16:06.765
Scott resigned from the Young
Conservative Republican Club...

01:16:06.849 --> 01:16:10.182
and started espousing left-wing,
Democratic, liberal philosophy.

01:16:10.224 --> 01:16:14.057
Dad was overjoyed. He was
just as proud as can be.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:18.390
Remember I told you New York was
the most beautiful in the fall?

01:16:18.475 --> 01:16:22.391
What I really meant was the
winter, at least when it snows.

01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:24.391
Because under a blanket of snow,

01:16:24.475 --> 01:16:28.683
New York City is truly gorgeous
and surprisingly peaceful.

01:16:28.766 --> 01:16:31.266
You know, when Christmas
comes we don't...

01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:34.976
We're not the kind of family that
hangs stockings or sings carols.

01:16:35.017 --> 01:16:37.476
We don't have a goose or anything.

01:16:37.517 --> 01:16:41.601
What we do do is head right for Paris and
spend our Christmas holiday at the Ritz.

01:17:28.187 --> 01:17:30.105
Here, honey,
put your finger here.

01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:32.105
Do it, hard.

01:17:32.188 --> 01:17:34.105
- Well, he has a
fever. - Ahh-choo!

01:17:34.188 --> 01:17:36.105
It's a cold.

01:17:36.188 --> 01:17:39.605
I told you you should've put on some dry
clothes after you fell in the fountain.

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:42.105
You go without me. I'll be all right.

01:17:42.188 --> 01:17:44.106
We don't want to go without you.

01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:47.106
The Marx Brothers' are your
favorite movies. Mom, I feel so bad.

01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:50.106
- He should stay home if he feels sick.
- I'm gonna stay home.

01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:54.897
I'm so excited; I'm meeting this
guy named Guy, or this guy named Guy.

01:17:54.981 --> 01:17:56.897
- Cool. Congratulations.
- Here, Dad.

01:17:56.981 --> 01:17:59.857
- I brought you some tea.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

01:17:59.898 --> 01:18:02.357
It's not gonna keep me awake?

01:18:02.398 --> 01:18:05.357
No, it's completely herbal.
It's peppermint flavored.

01:18:05.398 --> 01:18:07.982
- Hello, Joe. -
Joe! - Hi, Dad!

01:18:08.023 --> 01:18:12.274
Oh, I'd say hello, but I'm sick and,
you know, you always catch everything.

01:18:12.358 --> 01:18:14.774
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

01:18:14.858 --> 01:18:16.774
- I'm not going tonight.
- Why not?

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.941
- I knew it.
- What's wrong, Dad?

01:18:19.024 --> 01:18:20.941
- Von left me.
- What?

01:18:21.024 --> 01:18:22.941
What happened?

01:18:23.024 --> 01:18:26.442
I have no idea, but she's
on her way back to New York.

01:18:26.525 --> 01:18:29.442
When she first came,
everything was perfect.

01:18:29.525 --> 01:18:33.150
She said it was like a
dream had come true for her.

01:18:33.192 --> 01:18:36.234
And then suddenly, this morning...

01:18:36.317 --> 01:18:40.818
Um, I want to go back home...

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.818
to Greg.

01:18:44.193 --> 01:18:46.110
Really?

01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:48.610
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:18:48.693 --> 01:18:50.651
Since when has, uh, this happened?

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:52.985
I don't know.

01:18:53.026 --> 01:18:55.111
Well, why?

01:18:55.194 --> 01:18:57.111
I... I...
I don't know.

01:18:57.194 --> 01:18:59.611
I don't know how to explain it, exactly.

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:02.111
Well, just tell me. You know, just...

01:19:02.194 --> 01:19:05.694
Well, it's not that I don't
think that you're great. Okay?

01:19:05.777 --> 01:19:07.819
- Um, I think you're great.
- Yeah?

01:19:07.902 --> 01:19:12.487
Um, just, for years, you know,
I've been married to Greg,

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:15.070
and, and he can be difficult,

01:19:15.153 --> 01:19:20.112
and we've had our ups
and downs, certainly.

01:19:20.195 --> 01:19:23.113
- Since when did you have all these...
- I don't know.

01:19:23.196 --> 01:19:27.946
It's just, I've... I've
always had this fantasy, okay,

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.946
that, um...

01:19:30.029 --> 01:19:33.113
that one day I would
meet the perfect man...

01:19:33.196 --> 01:19:36.905
and he would fulfill my
dreams and I would have...

01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:39.405
the perfect life.

01:19:39.489 --> 01:19:42.614
That fantasy, I think,

01:19:42.697 --> 01:19:47.947
always sort of, um, was part of this
dissatisfaction that I had with Greg...

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:49.947
and, and my life.

01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:53.615
And then you came along
and you seemed to know...

01:19:53.698 --> 01:19:56.948
every secret thing about me.

01:19:58.906 --> 01:20:01.698
Let me put it this way.

01:20:01.781 --> 01:20:04.698
I have seen my dream come true,

01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:08.324
and my fantasy no longer tortures me.

01:20:08.366 --> 01:20:10.824
I can deal with it.

01:20:12.699 --> 01:20:15.699
Yeah, but that's so neurotic.

01:20:15.782 --> 01:20:18.699
Well, I know. I'm crazy.

01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:22.867
Well, but supposing I said to you...

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:25.367
that none of this was really true;

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:29.034
that this was all a facade
that I've been putting on;

01:20:29.117 --> 01:20:33.368
that-that-that somehow
I had, you know, access...

01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:36.993
to your deepest feelings and your
needs and all your secret thoughts...

01:20:37.035 --> 01:20:39.993
and, and I've been, I've
been playing this character...

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.535
just to, just to win you over,

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:45.535
to get you to like me, make you happy.

01:20:45.576 --> 01:20:48.244
If that's what you told me,

01:20:48.327 --> 01:20:50.744
then I'd say you were crazy.

01:20:52.327 --> 01:20:56.036
So that's exactly why I'm
not going tonight. You know?

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:59.036
Instead, I-I have plans
to go to Napoleon's tomb.

01:20:59.119 --> 01:21:03.370
- I'm gonna lie down next to him. That's
Christmas Eve for me. - That's so sad.

01:21:03.453 --> 01:21:06.370
- The women you pick.
- No, you're going out.

01:21:06.453 --> 01:21:08.370
- Aaaaah-choo! -
Somebody's gotta take Mom.

01:21:08.453 --> 01:21:11.370
- He's so sick.
- You're too sick to go out this evening?

01:21:11.453 --> 01:21:14.870
- I'm fine, as long as I don't move
my eyeballs. - He has a 101 temperature.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:17.871
- You're not going anywhere tonight.
- But I'm not in a Groucho mood.

01:21:17.954 --> 01:21:19.871
- Aw, come on. You'll love it. Go.
- It's Christmas Eve.

01:21:19.954 --> 01:21:21.871
It's Paris. There's a ball.

01:21:21.954 --> 01:21:25.871
Besides, you're on the committee that
arranged the party for the Cinematheque.

01:21:25.954 --> 01:21:29.621
- You have to go. Enjoy yourself.
- I'll go for a couple hours.

01:21:29.704 --> 01:21:32.622
I gotta stay here, but
there's no reason you don't go.

01:21:32.705 --> 01:21:34.664

our first Christmas Eve in Paris,

01:23:37.964 --> 01:23:40.506
the month before we got married?

01:23:40.589 --> 01:23:42.548
I do, because that was...

01:23:42.589 --> 01:23:46.048
that was when I knew that someday I
would absolutely have to live here.

01:23:46.089 --> 01:23:49.048
Mmm. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

01:23:50.423 --> 01:23:53.882
I don't wanna panic you.
That was decades ago.

01:23:53.924 --> 01:23:56.882
- I mean, decades, not, not...
- I know, I know. It was decades ago.

01:23:56.924 --> 01:23:59.799
Do you remember that
cafe we used to go to?

01:23:59.882 --> 01:24:03.299
Cafe Therese, or whatever,
with the cats? Do you remember?

01:24:03.382 --> 01:24:06.133
- Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
- Yeah.

01:24:06.216 --> 01:24:09.633
I hated that cat. I
mean, I-I-I hated...

01:24:09.716 --> 01:24:13.133
Well, maybe that's why you were
scratching yourself all night.

01:24:13.216 --> 01:24:16.633
Was I scratching myself all night?
Is that what you noticed about me?

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:18.633
I certainly... I certainly did.

01:24:18.716 --> 01:24:21.634
Well, I hated that cat.
I couldn't stand it.

01:24:21.717 --> 01:24:25.134
But now that cafe is right around
the corner from where I live.

01:24:25.217 --> 01:24:28.134
- You're joking. - Why would
I joke about something like that?

01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:31.467
- You wanna go have a drink there?
- No.

01:24:31.551 --> 01:24:33.634
- Why not?
- Because we're drinking here.

01:24:33.717 --> 01:24:37.635
Well, yeah, but... We can take our
mustaches off. Nobody's gonna know.

01:24:37.718 --> 01:24:40.802
- What, are you having a nostalgic,
a sudden... - Yeah, I'm having a thing.

01:24:40.885 --> 01:24:43.802
Sue me. I just thought
it would be kind of fun.

01:24:43.885 --> 01:24:47.802
- No, we can't sneak out... - Come on,
we'll take our mustaches off. No problem.

01:24:47.885 --> 01:24:50.303
- That I'd like to do.
- Wouldn't you? Me too.

01:24:50.386 --> 01:24:53.844
I never thought I'd hear you
say, "Take my mustache off."

01:24:53.928 --> 01:24:55.886
Please.

01:24:55.928 --> 01:24:58.803
Anyway, we'll go. I-I'm
a little... I feel good.

01:24:58.886 --> 01:25:01.803
I've had three glasses of
champagne. I feel fabulous.

01:25:01.886 --> 01:25:05.470
- Let's go see this place. - Yeah,
but y-you really wanna sneak out?

01:25:05.554 --> 01:25:08.970
I do. It's not... We snuck
out before. Do you remember?

01:25:09.054 --> 01:25:12.720
Remember that party with the
Hamilton-Wainwrights? It was so boring.

01:25:12.804 --> 01:25:14.720
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:25:14.804 --> 01:25:19.346
- I remember because we snuck out
through the toilet window. - Right!

01:25:19.388 --> 01:25:23.013
The guy was singing "Climb Every
Mountain," and we couldn't bear it.

01:25:23.096 --> 01:25:26.055
You knocked over the punch
bowl, if I remember correctly.

01:25:26.096 --> 01:25:30.055
Yes, but you were the one who let out
the piercing shriek that got us caught.

01:25:30.096 --> 01:25:33.222
Oh, and do you remember how
we made love? You know...

01:25:33.306 --> 01:25:35.722
- Ooh. Oh, I dropped...
- You dropped your cigar.

01:25:35.806 --> 01:25:38.722
I know. Give me my cigar.
I dropped the cigar and...

01:25:38.806 --> 01:25:40.722
You're so drunk.

01:25:40.806 --> 01:25:43.389
I remember us making love, I, uh...

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:46.515
- Candlelight. - I remember
the candles; I remember the hotel.

01:25:46.557 --> 01:25:50.140
I just don't remember you, unless
you were the one who was under me.

01:25:50.223 --> 01:25:53.515
- Oh, now you're in character.
- I don't know where I am.

01:25:53.557 --> 01:25:56.015
- I'm... I'm lost.
- Come on, let's go.

01:25:56.057 --> 01:25:58.932
No, it's cold out there.
Our coats are in the car.

01:25:59.016 --> 01:26:00.933
Forget it. It's a warm night.

01:26:01.016 --> 01:26:02.933
Come on. Pretend you're young.

01:26:03.016 --> 01:26:05.933
Well, I could for you.

01:26:08.183 --> 01:26:10.099
You're better off without her.

01:26:10.183 --> 01:26:13.600
How do you know? You never met her.

01:26:13.684 --> 01:26:15.600
I know you.

01:26:15.684 --> 01:26:17.600
Yeah. So? What does that mean?

01:26:17.684 --> 01:26:20.600
A good psychiatrist
that listened to you...

01:26:20.684 --> 01:26:23.684
would think that every time I get
involved with a woman, you get jealous.

01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:25.725
What are you laughing?

01:26:25.767 --> 01:26:29.726
"Jealous." Joe, I just wish you'd pick
somebody that could make you happy.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:32.060
- Like who?
- I made you happy.

01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:35.060
- Yeah... I didn't say you didn't.
- I made you very happy.

01:26:35.143 --> 01:26:38.185
- Hey... - When we weren't,
you know, at each other's throats.

01:26:38.268 --> 01:26:41.811
- Does this ring a bell? This is
why I took you here. -

01:26:41.894 --> 01:26:45.102
- Does this mean anything to you?
- Is this... Is this where we...

01:26:45.186 --> 01:26:48.102
This is it, yes. That's why
I dragged you all over town.

01:26:48.186 --> 01:26:50.477
Oh! Ohh! Oh, my God!

01:26:50.561 --> 01:26:53.477
- You remember this?
- This is where we stayed up all night.

01:26:53.561 --> 01:26:57.145
I know. I held you in my
arms 'til the light came up.

01:26:57.228 --> 01:26:59.687
- Do you remember that? Do you
remember that song? - Yeah, I do.

01:26:59.728 --> 01:27:03.187
'Cause I still sing that song.
I first heard it from you.

01:27:03.228 --> 01:27:05.728

had we stayed together.

01:30:47.786 --> 01:30:50.495
That's something we're never gonna know.

01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:53.578
We've managed to produce...

01:30:53.661 --> 01:30:55.578
a fabulous daughter, though.

01:30:55.661 --> 01:30:58.079
- I mean, she is
unbelievable. - Mm-hmm.

01:30:58.162 --> 01:31:00.871
She's got your looks, fortunately,

01:31:00.912 --> 01:31:04.371
and my... my magic personality.

01:31:04.412 --> 01:31:06.871
- Yeah, she is wonderful.
- She's great.

01:31:06.912 --> 01:31:10.412
And-And you've been very happy with
Bob, so that's been a good thing.

01:31:10.497 --> 01:31:12.913
- Oh, he's wonderful.
- I think he's great.

01:31:12.997 --> 01:31:16.413
I don't think you could've done
better. I think he's a fabulous guy.

01:31:16.497 --> 01:31:19.413
Of course there have been
a few times, you will admit,

01:31:19.497 --> 01:31:22.413
that, uh, you did call
me in dire emergency...

01:31:22.497 --> 01:31:25.414
and I had to come by and bail you out.

01:31:25.498 --> 01:31:28.414
- I know you did.
- Two major fights with Bob, I remember,

01:31:28.498 --> 01:31:32.414
and one disgusting lump that
turned out to be completely benign,

01:31:32.498 --> 01:31:34.914
though you were panicked beyond belief.

01:31:34.998 --> 01:31:38.414
- You were there for me.
That's the main thing. - And you for me.

01:31:38.498 --> 01:31:40.415
And I appreciate it.

01:31:40.499 --> 01:31:43.415
I think, actually, that
we-we've been better friends...

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:45.415
than, than, than husband and wife.

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:47.749
Yeah, probably we have.

01:31:47.832 --> 01:31:50.874
But, you know, nobody made
me laugh the way you did, Joe.

01:31:50.915 --> 01:31:53.875
I love Bob with all my
heart. It isn't that.

01:31:53.916 --> 01:31:58.291
It's just that you could always,
you know, you could push that button.

01:31:58.375 --> 01:32:01.375
- Why is that so important?
- I don't know.

01:32:01.416 --> 01:32:04.208
I don't know. Maybe we're crazy.

01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:12.876
So, did that girl that dumped
you today, did she make you laugh?

01:32:12.917 --> 01:32:17.876
I don't know, I... I
have to put that behind.

01:32:19.084 --> 01:32:21.042
You know.

01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:26.127
- Funny how life goes.
- It's amazing. Amazing.

01:32:53.879 --> 01:32:55.962

01:32:56.045 --> 01:32:58.420
