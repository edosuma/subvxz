00:02.839 --> 00:04.000
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.040 --> 00:06.320
-Maybe ask him why he's
suddenly all over you.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.480
He's trying to psych me out.

00:07.519 --> 00:10.679
-And why would it psych
you out, boyfriend?

00:10.720 --> 00:12.080
-Asking you to the beach
was a tactic.

00:12.119 --> 00:12.800
It didn't end like that--

00:12.839 --> 00:14.039
-Stop talking.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.440
This crush is officially over.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.079
-I might win the Prix.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.640
I don't care either way.

00:19.679 --> 00:21.519
-Auditions start tomorrow for
the end of year concert of

00:21.559 --> 00:23.640
"Peter Pan." This is your chance
to end the year on a

00:23.679 --> 00:26.440
high note, especially while our
Nationals champs are away

00:26.480 --> 00:27.879
showboating.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.160
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN):
Australia, these are your

00:29.199 --> 00:31.440
representative!

00:31.480 --> 00:38.560
[theme song]

00:38.600 --> 00:42.119
-Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:42.159 --> 00:45.520
Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:45.560 --> 00:52.039
Take a breath, close
your eyes.

00:52.079 --> 00:59.399
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

00:59.439 --> 01:01.399
This is my chance.

01:01.439 --> 01:03.399
This is my chance.

01:03.439 --> 01:07.359
My chance to feel alive.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.359
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.319
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:16.359 --> 01:18.239
TARA NARRATING: Scary fact.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.519
Apparently when you meet
someone, you both decide what

01:20.560 --> 01:23.159
you think of each other in
less than 10 seconds.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.640
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): He thinks
you've been ignoring him since

01:24.680 --> 01:26.319
the Nationals.

01:26.359 --> 01:27.799
-I am.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.599
TARA NARRATING: To make
this easier--

01:29.640 --> 01:30.560
-Oh come on, Zach.

01:30.599 --> 01:32.000
Put us out of our misery.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.719
TARA NARRATING: Our brains use
the strongest information

01:33.760 --> 01:36.200
available to classify
people into types.

01:36.239 --> 01:39.120
-All right, in the end of year
production of "Peter Pan," the

01:39.159 --> 01:41.640
title role goes to
Christian Reed.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.280
TARA NARRATING: There's
the dark, moody,

01:43.319 --> 01:45.120
angry-with-the-world type.

01:45.159 --> 01:47.760
Popular with impressionable
girls everywhere.

01:47.799 --> 01:51.400
-Tinkerbell, none other than
Katrina Karamakov.

01:51.439 --> 01:52.519
[applause]

01:52.560 --> 01:53.280
TARA NARRATING: The witty,
sparkly, living

01:53.319 --> 01:55.560
embodiment of a BFF.

01:55.599 --> 01:58.040
-John Darling, Sir
Benjamin Tickle.

01:58.079 --> 01:59.159
[applause]

01:59.200 --> 02:00.680
TARA NARRATING: The
class clown.

02:00.719 --> 02:03.040
With the talent for saying the
wrong thing at the wrong time.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.040
-Are you sure I, I shouldn't
be Peter?

02:05.079 --> 02:10.318
-And last but not least, Wendy
Darling will be performed by

02:10.360 --> 02:10.800
Abigail Armstrong.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.199
[applause]

02:12.240 --> 02:13.639
TARA NARRATING: The single
minded, get out of my way or

02:13.680 --> 02:15.680
I'll remove your internal
organs type.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.039
ZACH (OFFSCREEN):
Congratulations.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.199
[applause]

02:18.240 --> 02:19.599
TARA NARRATING: Once you've
been typecast,

02:19.639 --> 02:21.439
there are two choices.

02:21.479 --> 02:23.800
Love it or fight it.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.199
-[giggling]

02:28.240 --> 02:30.159
-Stop that!

02:30.199 --> 02:32.680
This is the opportunity to do
your final year at any of the

02:32.719 --> 02:34.759
world's top ballet schools.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.360
-Well, it's just that we were
your worst students.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.479
-The irony is not lost
on me, Samuel.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.599
I want your school selection
by the end of the week.

02:45.639 --> 02:47.360
-Miss Raine, hi.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.479
Um, I've been cast as Wendy.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.360
-I hear you were very natural
in the audition.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.319
-With respect, I don't really
feel I'm suited to the role.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.319
-I would love to play Wendy.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.400
-Tara, you and Samuel have
the Prix to focus on.

03:00.439 --> 03:01.800
Abigail, you clearly
have work to do

03:01.840 --> 03:03.319
connecting with your character.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.360
Now out!

03:04.400 --> 03:05.560
All of you, out!

03:12.280 --> 03:15.360
-Um, Grace hasn't
been responding

03:15.400 --> 03:17.599
to any of my emails.

03:17.639 --> 03:19.800
How is she?

03:19.840 --> 03:23.120
-I don't know.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.439
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Why don't you
take me to the Winter Festival

03:25.479 --> 03:26.240
to celebrate?

03:26.280 --> 03:27.120
-Hmm.

03:27.159 --> 03:28.560
Or we could watch a DVD.

03:28.599 --> 03:29.319
-Yeah, yeah.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.520
The bird is in the nest.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.680
KAT (OFFSCREEN): For the
fifth night in a row?

03:31.719 --> 03:33.759
I think Peter and Tink
are stuck in a rut.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.719
-If you guys could live anywhere
in the world for one

03:35.759 --> 03:37.479
year, where would it be?

03:37.520 --> 03:38.919
-Tara?

03:38.960 --> 03:42.080
You've been avoiding me this
whole time, so this one goes

03:42.120 --> 03:42.520
out to you.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.120
-Oh no.

03:43.159 --> 03:44.159
Please no.

03:44.199 --> 03:46.319
[music playing]

03:46.360 --> 03:47.080
-[singing]

03:47.120 --> 03:48.479
Well, you're all wound up.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.319
You got so much to say.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.319
You got a bee in your bonnet.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.039
Come on, kick it away.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.159
You want to push me and shove
me, but you know you love me.

03:58.199 --> 04:00.400
So babe, let's call it a day.

04:00.439 --> 04:02.039
You know I'm sorry.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.120
Just speak and I'll obey.

04:04.159 --> 04:13.479
Check out my chorey, 'cause
I am here, here to stay.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.279
You may kiss me now!

04:16.319 --> 04:18.199
-Yeah, kiss him!

04:18.240 --> 04:21.399
[cheers and applause]

04:21.439 --> 04:23.079
-Can we go somewhere and talk?

04:23.120 --> 04:23.439
-What?

04:23.480 --> 04:24.120
No kiss?

04:24.160 --> 04:25.720
But I was a sensation!

04:25.759 --> 04:26.560
-[sighs]

04:26.600 --> 04:28.079
Look, thank you for the song.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.160
I forgive you.

04:29.199 --> 04:31.160
The Nationals, using
me as a challenge.

04:31.199 --> 04:32.360
It's in the past.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.800
-Phase two.

04:39.839 --> 04:43.240
Stay tantalizingly close, but
withhold my affections.

04:43.279 --> 04:45.839
-Yeah, girls go crazy
for that.

04:45.879 --> 04:49.279
-I mean, who was ever known
for playing Wendy Darling?

04:49.319 --> 04:52.199
It's like Sylvie Guillem
doing Forsythe.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.360
[inaudible]

04:53.399 --> 04:56.160
port de bras in "Swan
Lake." It's stupid.

04:56.199 --> 04:58.480
-Oh, I'm sure your porta
thingies are just as good as

04:58.519 --> 04:59.800
[inaudible] whatevers.

04:59.839 --> 05:01.199
You know, better even.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.800
[laughs]

05:02.839 --> 05:03.800
-You're bored.

05:03.839 --> 05:04.600
-[laughs]

05:04.639 --> 05:05.759
Not at all.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.279
I, it's a change from iterative
discourse on

05:07.319 --> 05:08.480
independent theater politics.

05:11.199 --> 05:14.800
And welcome to the world of
pretentious uni students.

05:14.839 --> 05:16.120
Um, but seriously.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.480
Like, what else are you into,
like besides ballet?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.040
-Pilates?

05:22.079 --> 05:23.000
-Hmm.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.480
-Effective kilojoule
management?

05:24.519 --> 05:25.839
-[laughs]

05:33.399 --> 05:34.839
-And our oceans.

05:34.879 --> 05:37.079
I'm really into fish
preservation.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.399
-Ah.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.240
Do you mean fish conservation?

05:40.279 --> 05:43.399
Or do you actually
pickle fish?

05:43.439 --> 05:45.800
-Both.

05:45.839 --> 05:47.319
-Huh.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.079
You should take me
to the aquarium.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.319
I haven't been since
I was a kid.

05:52.759 --> 05:54.839
-That sorta sounded like
you're asking me out.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.319
[laughs]

05:56.360 --> 05:57.519
-Maybe.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.399
-(RUSSIAN ACCENT) Russia
for the third time!

06:04.439 --> 06:05.319
It's a sign!

06:05.360 --> 06:06.680
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN):
And my turn.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.279
TARA (OFFSCREEN): [laughs]

06:11.720 --> 06:13.439
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Again?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.040
-Mm, rich and silky.

06:16.079 --> 06:17.680
Hey Sammy, do you want one?

06:17.720 --> 06:20.199
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.480
-Oh, look sorry, Tara.

06:22.519 --> 06:25.160
Look, it, I had plenty this
morning, but now they're all

06:25.199 --> 06:25.920
gone.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.439
-Imagine living in Russia!

06:27.480 --> 06:29.399
Furry hats, ice skating.

06:29.439 --> 06:34.120
-Hey um, is it, is it hot in
here? 'Cause like, it's um,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.279
yeah it's really, really hot.

06:36.319 --> 06:39.519
-Hey, we're watching a horror
marathon if you guys can.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.319
-Uh, yeah.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.360
You guys can share the corny
picnic I thoughtfully prepared

06:44.399 --> 06:45.399
as well.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.639
-No, I prefer Russian
cinema, but--

06:47.680 --> 06:48.839
-I'm in!

06:52.800 --> 06:54.800
-It all turned out very
differently in your head,

06:54.839 --> 06:55.399
didn't it?

06:55.439 --> 06:56.399
-Yeah.

06:56.439 --> 07:00.800
[screams on television]

07:05.360 --> 07:06.319
-Lieberman.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.439
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Can
you please move?

07:07.480 --> 07:07.800
-How much do you know
about fish things?

07:07.839 --> 07:08.600
-Out!

07:08.639 --> 07:10.399
-Abigail, can you move?

07:10.439 --> 07:11.399
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Please move.

07:11.439 --> 07:11.759
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN):
Please move.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.360
-Guys.

07:13.399 --> 07:17.600
Um, in what context?

07:17.639 --> 07:20.360
-I have a date at the aquarium,
and I need to become

07:20.399 --> 07:22.600
a marine expert in the
next 24 hours.

07:22.639 --> 07:24.800
-You have a, you have a date?

07:24.839 --> 07:27.319
-Why wouldn't I have a date?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.399
-No, you would.

07:28.439 --> 07:29.639
It's just uh, I'm confused
as to why--

07:29.680 --> 07:31.360
-I've kept a list of
ways you owe me.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.639
Skipping rehearsals without
permission to

07:38.680 --> 07:41.199
test practice a date.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.480
I've lost it.

07:43.519 --> 07:46.439
-Uh, can you please sit down
and say no to ballet guilt?

07:49.319 --> 07:51.480
-Wendy's a lead.

07:51.519 --> 07:55.319
Sappy, wimpy lead,
but it's a lead.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.800
If I miss rehearsals, Zach's
gonna downsize my solo.

07:57.839 --> 07:59.480
-But Zach's gonna have so
much to worry about,

07:59.519 --> 08:00.680
he's not gonna notice.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.319
And we'll just get someone
to fill in for you.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.279
-Please.

08:08.319 --> 08:09.319
Prix preparations
can wait a day.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.600
-All right, Tara.

08:10.639 --> 08:12.120
But you'll need to teach Abigail
the chorey later.

08:12.160 --> 08:12.800
-I get to play Wendy!

08:12.839 --> 08:14.199
I identify with Wendy!

08:14.240 --> 08:15.639
-I can see that!

08:15.680 --> 08:16.839
-Where is Abigail?

08:16.879 --> 08:18.199
-She's vomiting.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.319
Projectile style.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.759
-That's good, then.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.160
All right, today's rehearsal
is gonna focus on character

08:23.199 --> 08:24.480
motivations.

08:24.519 --> 08:27.480
So Ben and Tara, I want you
guys to talk about the

08:27.519 --> 08:29.160
brother/sister dynamics.

08:29.199 --> 08:30.639
-Fancy seeing you here.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.279
-Christian and Kat, you're gonna
mark through Peter and

08:33.320 --> 08:35.480
Tink's first pas de
deux with me.

08:35.519 --> 08:36.639
-All right.

08:39.879 --> 08:53.600
[music playing]

08:53.639 --> 08:56.320
-Nice and playful, Kat.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.519
Great work, guys.

09:00.559 --> 09:03.600
-So, I'm the older sibling and
you're the middle child, which

09:03.639 --> 09:05.480
probably means you
crave attention.

09:05.519 --> 09:06.480
-I knew it.

09:06.519 --> 09:07.799
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Knew what?

09:07.840 --> 09:09.279
-Giving up a day of
Prix practice just

09:09.320 --> 09:10.320
to fill in for Wendy.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.840
You couldn't stay
away from me.

09:11.879 --> 09:14.440
-Ben, you talk with your mouth
full, rarely use deodorant,

09:14.480 --> 09:16.360
and I've caught you picking
your nose on at least five

09:16.399 --> 09:16.720
occasions.

09:16.759 --> 09:17.440
-Whoa!

09:17.480 --> 09:18.279
Whoa, you have not!

09:20.240 --> 09:21.679
So?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.720

I liked about you.

15:25.879 --> 15:28.240
And you didn't feel
the same way.

15:28.279 --> 15:30.840
So admit that the only reason
you're chasing me now is

interested.

even been to the ballet.

at the Academy?

16:02.240 --> 16:06.120

16:06.159 --> 16:08.720
-Well, it's too far from the
international choreographers.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.399
Plus there's only really one
major ballet company.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.639
And because it's a relatively
young school, you don't really

16:14.679 --> 16:17.320
get that traditional grounding
like you would at say, the

16:17.360 --> 16:19.399
Royal or in Russia.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.159

on my short list?

into the boyfriend zone?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.600
Is it that silent, brooding
thing you do?

like a real girlfriend before.

to Sammy about this?

16:47.480 --> 16:51.080
OK, so you like Tara,
obviously.

16:51.120 --> 16:51.600
-Yeah.

16:51.639 --> 16:53.480
She's mental.

16:53.519 --> 16:56.440
Um, and she thinks that life
should be like the movies.

that I don't get her!

on Peter?

to grow up.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.480
-Well, that's very insightful.

19:18.519 --> 19:22.400
But uh, can you expand
on that?

19:22.440 --> 19:23.680
-He wants everything.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.839
You know, he wants Tink because
she's awesome and

19:26.880 --> 19:30.160
she's always there for
him when he needs it.

19:30.200 --> 19:34.160
But I think deep down,
Peter loves Wendy.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.519
-And why's that?

19:36.559 --> 19:38.519

him to be better

so he gives her up.

-It's a list.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.160
For after the end of
third year, when I

21:24.200 --> 21:25.240
have time for interests.

21:25.279 --> 21:26.599
-Oh, snap.

21:26.640 --> 21:30.119
Yeah, I made one myself before
um, before first year.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.039
I could help you tick it off.

21:33.079 --> 21:36.400
-You'll probably end up in
Berlin admiring artwork.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.440
-Ah!

21:37.480 --> 21:37.799
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): And
never come back.

21:43.200 --> 21:48.119
-Don't, don't tell anybody,
but if I win,

21:48.160 --> 21:49.519
I'm choosing Sydney.

21:55.519 --> 21:56.680
-Aaah!

21:56.720 --> 21:57.640
-Do you trust me?

21:57.680 --> 21:59.160
Do you trust me now?

21:59.200 --> 22:00.359
-[laughs]

22:03.799 --> 22:04.680
BEN (OFFSCREEN): [laughs]

22:04.720 --> 22:05.640
Awesome!

22:05.680 --> 22:06.839
-Whoo!

22:15.200 --> 22:17.799
-He got her a whole ice rink.

22:17.839 --> 22:19.200
-Trying too hard.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.599
-So, so this is the scene where
the easygoing girl tells

22:27.640 --> 22:31.519
the boy she loves that it's over
'cause he's still in love

22:31.559 --> 22:32.759
with someone else.

22:37.359 --> 22:39.400
And this is the part where you
fight for me and tell me I'm

22:39.440 --> 22:40.480
wrong.

22:40.519 --> 22:41.599
-Kat, that jealousy
thing is really--

22:41.640 --> 22:44.799
-It woke me up.

22:44.839 --> 22:46.799
It made me see things the
way they actually are.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.640
-Kat, I'm not still--

22:52.680 --> 22:54.279
I don't want to be with--

23:09.480 --> 23:11.759
TARA NARRATING: I might have
made up my mind about these

23:11.799 --> 23:13.240
people in the first
10 seconds.

23:15.839 --> 23:18.799
But the longer I know them, the
more I realize there's no

23:18.839 --> 23:20.400
typecast wide enough
to hold them.

23:23.559 --> 23:25.160
And the more they
can surprise me.

23:30.599 --> 23:33.559
