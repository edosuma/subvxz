00:04.105 --> 00:05.880
Travelin' by night,
keepin' watch by day...

00:05.957 --> 00:07.122
it's really takin' its toll.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.552
Keep saying we're gonna
find the right place.

00:11.629 --> 00:14.113
Maybe I'm just holding on
to an idea that isn't out there.

00:14.115 --> 00:17.700
Logan's guys.
They found us.

00:19.378 --> 00:20.970
Someone out there
needs our help.

00:21.046 --> 00:23.622
If this is what it takes,
then this is what it takes.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.048
We got gas.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.126
As much as we need after
a run to the oil fields.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.402
We're almost outta gas.

00:28.479 --> 00:30.112
No, we're not.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.247
Hello?

00:39.323 --> 00:40.823
Is someone there?

00:40.899 --> 00:43.075
I'm at a truck stop off 83.

00:43.086 --> 00:46.420
There was a Big Spot
near the turn off.

00:46.497 --> 00:48.664
Does anyone copy?

00:51.243 --> 00:53.261
Loud and clear there,
friend.

00:53.337 --> 00:55.045
You by
mile marker 65?

00:55.122 --> 00:57.047
How... How did you
know that?

00:57.124 --> 00:59.049
'Cause I'm the one
who set that place up.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.268
Name's Logan.

01:00.344 --> 01:03.012
To whom
do I have the pleasure?

01:03.088 --> 01:04.263
Serena.

01:04.274 --> 01:05.764
Okay, Serena.

01:05.775 --> 01:07.441
How can I help?

01:07.518 --> 01:09.893
They were
following me...

01:11.597 --> 01:14.448
I saw this place
and came inside.

01:14.525 --> 01:16.450
Serena,
don't you worry.

01:16.527 --> 01:19.236
My partner's
on that route right now.

01:21.106 --> 01:24.458
Desert Fox
to Polar Bear.

01:24.535 --> 01:26.577
We've got
an S.O.S. off 65.

01:26.653 --> 01:27.795
What's your twenty?

01:31.617 --> 01:33.876
Clayton,
do you copy?

01:35.305 --> 01:38.088
Jesus, you decide
to sleep in this morning?

01:39.792 --> 01:41.133
Hello?

01:42.503 --> 01:43.802
Please!

01:43.813 --> 01:46.305
I'm coming out there
to get you myself, Serena.

01:46.316 --> 01:48.098
Just sit tight,
lock the doors.

01:48.175 --> 01:50.059
- I'm on my way.
- Hurry.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:03.482 --> 02:05.574
They're at
the back door, too.

02:05.651 --> 02:07.835
Hang on, Serena.
Just hang on.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.329
I'm getting closer.

02:10.340 --> 02:11.789
I'm going as fast as I can
on this rig.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.290
Keep talking to me.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.126
I don't know what's wrong,
but they're close.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.753
Just keep talking.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.347
I can't hold them off!

02:19.423 --> 02:21.590
Did you
barricade the door?

02:21.667 --> 02:22.925
There's too many.

02:23.001 --> 02:24.843
It's not
going to hold!

02:24.854 --> 02:27.429
Shit.

02:27.506 --> 02:29.139
Clayton. Clayton!

02:29.216 --> 02:30.524
What's your twenty?

02:30.601 --> 02:32.643
We got an S.O.S.
at the Feedbag.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.038
Where are you?!

02:44.115 --> 02:45.948
Almost there!

02:50.863 --> 02:52.788
Stay with me,
Serena!

02:52.865 --> 02:55.791
Logan, I can't...
I can't!

02:55.868 --> 02:57.793
No! Oh, no!

03:01.874 --> 03:03.215
Serena?!

03:03.226 --> 03:04.558
Serena?!

03:05.961 --> 03:08.387
Serena?!

04:41.974 --> 04:44.325
Are you the man who was
trying to help that woman?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.508
Our condolences.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.794
A-And you are?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.837
Virginia.

05:05.848 --> 05:09.558
Folks call me Ginny.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.188
W-What do you want?

05:15.525 --> 05:17.107
To help.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.143
We've been
watching you.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.604
Listenin'.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.319
We want
the same thing you do,

05:29.396 --> 05:31.613
only bigger
and better.

05:33.692 --> 05:38.379
Together, we can get
from yesterday to tomorrow.

05:41.458 --> 05:44.167
I'm listening.

05:56.507 --> 05:59.145
Subtitles by explosiveskull
www.OpenSubtitles.org

06:04.890 --> 06:06.732
Which one?

06:06.742 --> 06:08.993
That one.

06:24.001 --> 06:26.844
Don't worry.
They won't eat you.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.269
Hey.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.817
Dom says we're runnin'
3,000 gallons ahead of schedule.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.402
Mm-hmm.

07:33.478 --> 07:36.330
We can do better.

07:36.407 --> 07:40.450
Luciana,
we have no place to store it.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.327
Sarah's due back
with the tanker tomorrow.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.745
Well, I hope so.

07:43.822 --> 07:45.497
'Cause my tour of duty here
at tank town

07:45.508 --> 07:47.958
is going a little longer than expected.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.793
It's not that bad.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.178
Every morning I wake up,

07:51.255 --> 07:52.963
my pillow look like
the shroud of Turin.

07:57.094 --> 07:59.520
Well, I like
what we're doing here.

07:59.596 --> 08:02.097
I don't mind
getting my hands dirty.

08:02.174 --> 08:04.641
It's not my hands
I'm worried about.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.852
It's everything else.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.574
I think she heard us
talking about her.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.368
Sarah,
is that you?

08:25.864 --> 08:28.373
That's not her rig.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.397
Get in the shed.
Now. Go.

09:00.732 --> 09:03.917
Might wanna rub the smoke
from your eyes, Chief.

09:03.994 --> 09:05.368
I ain't your sister.

09:05.445 --> 09:10.081
She's a lovely piece
of asphalt queen.

09:10.092 --> 09:14.503
I'm just a charming,
lanky asshole.

09:14.579 --> 09:16.546
What are you
doing here?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.674
You really
have to ask?

09:21.604 --> 09:24.054
Dom?

09:24.131 --> 09:25.764
Pete?

09:27.943 --> 09:30.727
Barely recognize you
under all that grime.

09:30.804 --> 09:35.065
So, this is where Clayton
stashed you boys away, huh?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.609
Don't take another step.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.286
I doubt you want us
firing weapons in here.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.288
So if I were you,

09:50.299 --> 09:53.634
I'd stop giving orders
and start waiting for them.

09:53.710 --> 09:56.303
What exactly do you think
you're gonna do here?

09:56.380 --> 09:58.305
Like the boxes say,

09:58.382 --> 10:01.466
"Take what you need,
leave what you don't."

10:01.477 --> 10:04.311
Well...

10:04.388 --> 10:09.099
we need
all of this.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.659
Is it
too much Phoenix?

10:21.646 --> 10:24.573
Magritte had his clouds,
you have your birds.

10:24.649 --> 10:26.992
Hey.
Did you leave this on?

10:27.002 --> 10:28.410
Almost out of gas.

10:28.486 --> 10:29.828
We won't be able
to charge it.

10:29.839 --> 10:31.839
I reached out to him.
He might be listening.

10:31.915 --> 10:34.416
- He might respond.
- Yeah, from the guy who brought us

10:34.492 --> 10:36.593
the highly reductive "people are people"?
I wouldn't hold my breath.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.129
We can't
give up on him.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.014
Wes didn't want our help before.

10:41.091 --> 10:42.683
Why would he possibly
want it now?

10:42.759 --> 10:45.177
Is anyb...

10:45.187 --> 10:46.520
Anybody there?

10:46.597 --> 10:48.355
We hear you.
Where are you?

10:48.432 --> 10:49.806
Truck stop...

10:49.883 --> 10:52.267
...ile... arker 65...

10:52.344 --> 10:55.020
I've locked myself inside...

10:56.440 --> 10:59.199
John, June?
Do you copy?

11:04.114 --> 11:05.706
Yeah,
we're here, Alicia.

11:05.782 --> 11:08.375
Just got off with someone
at one of Polar Bear's stops.

11:08.452 --> 11:10.285
Think they need help.
What's your twenty?

11:10.362 --> 11:12.162
We're on our way
to the oil fields.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.206
We think Logan
might have found them.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.291
What? How?

11:16.368 --> 11:17.834
We've got it covered.
Don't worry.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.794
We sent Charlie and Jacob
back to the convoy.

11:19.871 --> 11:21.889
But no one's heard
from Grace and Daniel,

11:21.965 --> 11:23.715
and we can't raise
Morgan and Al.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.176
Yeah, they're out of range.
We can't reach them, either.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.011
Help that person
in the truck stop.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.396
We got this.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.483
How do we know Logan's
not trying to draw us away?

11:41.559 --> 11:42.859
He's done it before.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.569
What's the point
in having gas

11:44.580 --> 11:46.154
if we can't use it
to help people?

11:46.231 --> 11:48.749
Come on.

11:58.335 --> 12:00.877
First time
I've seen them put to good use.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.715
- This your idea, boys?
- It was Clayton's.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.267
These were bad gents.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.718
He wanted to see 'em
do some good.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.438
No instructions,
Logan.

12:11.515 --> 12:13.523
Just these.

12:19.931 --> 12:22.282
How the hell you find us
without those?

12:22.359 --> 12:23.951
Well...

12:24.027 --> 12:26.903
I watched
your little movie.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.455
Least the stuff

12:28.532 --> 12:31.241
that ended up on the
cutting-room floor, anyway.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.909
Should've been
more careful

12:32.986 --> 12:36.454
where you pointed that camera
when these were out.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.707
You wanted the journals.

12:38.783 --> 12:41.584
Maybe you'll actually remember
what you used to believe.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.129
I do remember.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.849
Doesn't mean he was right
about any of it.

12:48.752 --> 12:49.926
No! Stop!

12:50.003 --> 12:52.854
Sit... down.

13:00.397 --> 13:02.656
Smart girl.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.909
Polar Bear's ideas,
what you're doing,

13:05.986 --> 13:08.161
it's not really
making a difference.

13:08.238 --> 13:10.163
It's just prolonging
the inevitable.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.782
Survival of
the fittest.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.743
Adaption, evolution.

13:14.819 --> 13:16.953
Why are you doing this?

13:17.030 --> 13:20.173
I already told Morgan...
I am helping people.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.508
Just not in a way

13:21.585 --> 13:23.335
you're gonna want
to get on board with.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.794
You want
to try us first?

13:24.871 --> 13:26.171
Nah.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.681
You wouldn't have
the stomach for it.

13:27.758 --> 13:31.435
Now, you gonna show us
how to make the gas or what?

13:38.468 --> 13:40.944
No.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.190
Didn't think so.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.034
Okay.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.819
What's your ETA?

13:49.896 --> 13:51.988
We need you
to start cooking.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.115
Not as optimistic
as before.

13:54.192 --> 13:55.825
Why?
What's going on?

13:55.902 --> 13:57.452
We hit
a roadblock.

13:57.529 --> 13:58.870
Well,
un-block it, now.

13:58.947 --> 14:00.756
We're about
to start a new batch.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.794
We don't have time
to find a new route.

14:05.870 --> 14:08.797
Let's get these
off the road.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.684
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:12.761 --> 14:14.386
Whoa.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.012
Some fellas
will do anything

14:16.089 --> 14:18.231
to avoid
askin' for directions.

14:19.810 --> 14:24.062
Lucky for you,
we know the way.

14:28.226 --> 14:31.361
Logan's already made it
to the oil fields.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.871
You'll never get inside.

14:32.948 --> 14:34.915
We will
if we show up in your truck.

14:34.991 --> 14:37.700
You said I shoulda killed you
when I had the chance.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.920
I'm glad I didn't,

14:39.996 --> 14:42.330
'cause we wouldn't have
a way in.

14:42.407 --> 14:44.207
I ain't helping you.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.594
- -I've done a lot of
bad shit I got to live with,

14:47.671 --> 14:50.430
but the one thing
I can't abide with

14:50.507 --> 14:55.051
is that I killed Polar Bear
for nothin'.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.271
You?
You I can live with.

15:04.521 --> 15:08.064
Let's go.

15:48.899 --> 15:51.941
What's the matter?

15:52.018 --> 15:53.234
It's too windy.

15:53.311 --> 15:54.986
We should be
putting it out.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.487
If we get it
too hot,

15:56.498 --> 15:58.907
we won't be able
to separate the oil anyway.

15:58.983 --> 16:00.167
Maybe not.

16:00.243 --> 16:02.169
Someone's come to assist
with the cook.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.091
You don't seem happy
to see me, Logie.

16:17.168 --> 16:19.093
Not who
you were expecting?

16:19.170 --> 16:20.604
Where is he?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.764
We had
a little chat.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.849
He decided
today was the perfect day

16:24.860 --> 16:27.644
to stop being
an asshole.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.910
You're gonna have to do it
for us, then.

16:42.628 --> 16:45.378
Consider that
a friendly warning,

16:45.455 --> 16:48.715
in case anybody's got
an itchy trigger finger.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.345
So let's just walk away
and go our separate ways.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.065
Our people want
no part of this shitshow.

17:05.141 --> 17:08.068
Problem there is,
the show must go on.

17:08.144 --> 17:10.353
And you just walked
right on stage.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.230
Glad you had
your fun,

17:12.241 --> 17:14.574
but we both know
how this ends.

17:14.651 --> 17:16.242
Do we?

17:16.319 --> 17:18.694
Don't worry.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.196
They had the chance
to kill me.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.324
They didn't take it.

17:23.401 --> 17:25.585
None of that's
about to change now.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.917
You may be a good shot,

17:32.928 --> 17:35.595
but this is one
you're not gonna take.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.265
Not unless you have to.

17:53.431 --> 17:55.782
You're bluffing.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.619
When you're right,
you're right.

18:09.131 --> 18:12.123
We ain't here
to make our iron bark.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.541
And I ain't here

18:13.618 --> 18:15.251
to take over the oil fields,
either.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.378
I'm hoping you'll listen
to some reason.

18:17.455 --> 18:19.306
Stop what
you're doing now,

18:19.382 --> 18:22.717
or you might get to the point
where you can't undo it.

18:22.794 --> 18:25.979
What I did
to Clayton...

18:26.056 --> 18:27.305
got him killed.

18:27.316 --> 18:28.982
That's something
I gotta live with.

18:31.636 --> 18:35.647
Something I regret
every day.

18:35.657 --> 18:39.108
Moment I saw him
in my rearview...

18:39.185 --> 18:43.905
moment I could've stopped,
done the right thing...

18:43.981 --> 18:46.574
moment I didn't
do jack.

18:46.651 --> 18:48.668
She's right, man.

18:48.745 --> 18:51.079
You don't want want to live
with this on your conscience.

18:52.657 --> 18:54.123
You know what?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.416
You want me
to be reasonable?

18:55.493 --> 18:57.418
I'll be reasonable.

18:57.495 --> 18:58.753
The kids can go.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.685
If you two
get to work.

19:08.264 --> 19:11.516
That's a reasonable trade,
don't you think?

19:18.516 --> 19:21.859
They're gonna need a car
and some gas.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.195
We can spare
a few gallons.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.989
- We're not leaving!
- We can help.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.463
You're leaving.

19:45.135 --> 19:47.051
Convoy's at
the rendezvous.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.561
Remember where that is?

19:48.638 --> 19:50.847
Yeah.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.391
Good. Skedaddle.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.524
What about the rats?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.276
We'll take care
of them.

20:03.352 --> 20:04.744
Just be safe.

20:06.564 --> 20:09.031
Go.

20:13.422 --> 20:17.081
They're starting
to build up outside.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.666
We're coming.

20:18.743 --> 20:20.835
I just need you
to stay calm, okay?

20:20.912 --> 20:22.336
What's your name?

20:22.413 --> 20:24.881
It isn't safe
for me to say.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.382
You're gonna be okay.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.884
We're coming to help.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.886
Are you really?

20:29.962 --> 20:31.938
- Really what?
- Coming to help?

20:33.683 --> 20:35.516
What's wrong?

20:35.593 --> 20:37.360
The inevitable.

20:41.098 --> 20:42.866
We're on our way. Just do
what you gotta do to stay safe.

20:44.268 --> 20:45.526
Morgan, Al?

20:45.603 --> 20:47.028
If anybody's listening,

20:47.104 --> 20:49.697
we could really use
your help out here.

21:06.624 --> 21:09.184
This is getting
out of hand.

21:10.386 --> 21:12.303
The fire's too big.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.138
If the smoke doesn't draw them,
the flames will.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.815
Then you shouldn't have sent
my cook packing.

21:15.892 --> 21:17.400
Get back to work.

21:20.972 --> 21:23.773
Why all the hustle?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.191
Won't make it
any safer.

21:25.268 --> 21:27.494
Yeah. Where's the fire?
Aside from the obvious.

21:27.570 --> 21:28.995
I don't waste time.

21:29.072 --> 21:31.113
One more thing
you could all stand to learn.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.074
How about you lay
some real truth on us?

21:33.150 --> 21:34.659
Who the hell
is this gas for?

21:34.669 --> 21:37.411
No need to concern yourself
with details.

21:37.488 --> 21:40.957
The point is,
they are gonna help.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.344
It's just not gonna be
one person at a time,

21:44.420 --> 21:46.754
'cause that kind of
mom-and-pop crap

21:46.831 --> 21:49.298
just makes people think
they have a chance.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.967
I'm sorry
you think that way.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.301
Don't be.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.262
I have you
to thank for it.

21:54.338 --> 21:57.682
What's that
supposed to mean?

21:57.692 --> 22:00.527
While back,
I got a call.

22:00.603 --> 22:02.770
Someone who needed help.

22:02.847 --> 22:06.190
She was on Clayton's route,
and, uh...

22:06.201 --> 22:09.777
he wasn't answering,
so I went out there myself.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.786
And, uh...

22:18.863 --> 22:21.372
I didn't get there
in time.

22:24.368 --> 22:28.388
And I had to listen to her
get torn apart.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.719
Nothing I could do.

22:34.729 --> 22:37.897
All because
Clayton wasn't there.

22:37.974 --> 22:40.891
All because
you stole his rig.

22:40.902 --> 22:44.645
I'm doing what I'm doing
because of you.

22:44.722 --> 22:47.148
So you really
want to help?

22:48.559 --> 22:50.359
You really want
to make a difference?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.863
Close!
We're close!

22:53.940 --> 22:56.032
Walk away!

22:57.827 --> 23:00.661
'Cause you've already
done your part, sweetheart.

23:00.738 --> 23:03.247
And nothin' you
or any of you people do

23:03.258 --> 23:05.592
is gonna
make up for that.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.265
Hope we're not interrupting,

23:12.342 --> 23:15.092
but you guys have to
get out of there... now.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.196
We've gotta
kill the fire!

24:18.741 --> 24:20.741
I can't.

24:20.818 --> 24:22.669
It's burning too hot.

24:43.683 --> 24:44.890
There's more
on the ridge.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.693
We'll put them down.

24:46.769 --> 24:48.194
Oh!

24:52.683 --> 24:54.108
We need our weapons!

25:03.619 --> 25:05.536
I'm drawing
more than I'm putting down.

25:09.408 --> 25:10.550
Guys, we can't
take them out.

25:10.626 --> 25:12.385
You have to
clear out of there.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.016
I need help
with the pump!

25:42.083 --> 25:45.076
Logan,
we got a problem!

25:45.086 --> 25:48.037
We also have
a contract.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.590
Someone deal with
the dead!

25:52.427 --> 25:55.044
Hey!
We need our guns!

25:55.121 --> 25:56.545
Dwight,
we need to boogie, man!

25:56.622 --> 25:58.506
No, we need the gas
to do what we're doing.

25:58.582 --> 26:00.549
We need to be alive
to do what we're doing!

26:00.626 --> 26:03.102
He's right.

26:07.725 --> 26:09.475
The tanker.
Right?

26:09.552 --> 26:11.110
The tanker
will hold us over?

26:11.187 --> 26:12.612
On it.

26:12.688 --> 26:14.063
Help me.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.232
Come on.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.858
Don't you get it?!

26:17.935 --> 26:19.360
We need to bail!

26:19.436 --> 26:21.070
No one is bailing!

26:21.146 --> 26:22.863
Now help me get this thing down
before the...

26:25.985 --> 26:28.702
Don't just stand there!
Kill it!

26:32.300 --> 26:36.794
Screw this!

26:36.871 --> 26:38.587
Where the hell
you think you're going?!

27:03.981 --> 27:06.407
Let's go!

27:06.483 --> 27:09.326
Not on it.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.245
Shit.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.083
Wait.
What's going on?

27:16.160 --> 27:17.918
I can't do it.
I can't leave him.

27:17.995 --> 27:19.253
You heard
what the man said.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.005
Walk away.
He doesn't want our help.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.182
If I'm not back
in two minutes,

27:23.259 --> 27:25.676
get in the truck,
drive.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.927
Sarah...

27:27.004 --> 27:28.596
Don't talk me
out of it, Wen.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.524
This is what
I shoulda done back then.

27:31.601 --> 27:33.693
It's what
we both shoulda done.

27:49.619 --> 27:51.377
Are you there?

27:51.454 --> 27:53.212
Do you copy?

27:53.289 --> 27:55.882
The doors, I'm not sure
how much longer they'll hold.

27:55.958 --> 27:57.833
And my walkie,
it's dying.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.218
It's okay.

27:59.295 --> 28:01.721
You're at a truck stop.
Look for a C.B.

28:01.797 --> 28:03.556
It's gonna be connected
to a generator.

28:03.633 --> 28:04.882
Turn it on.

28:04.893 --> 28:07.843
Broadcast
where you are.

28:09.472 --> 28:13.482
Do you copy?

28:34.947 --> 28:38.707
You... You shoulda
left me out there.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.043
You're a real shit-ass
with thank-yous.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.711
I just
saved your keister.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.589
You just prolonged
the inevitable.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.093
If the smoke doesn't get us,
the dead will.

28:49.103 --> 28:52.438
You may have tried
to help other people...

28:52.515 --> 28:55.099
but no one's
coming to help us.

28:57.019 --> 28:58.936
Maybe you're right.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.105
Why don't you
go back out there?

29:01.115 --> 29:02.782
Is anybody there?

29:02.858 --> 29:04.233
I need help.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.235
More people out there
for you to save.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.987
Hello?

29:08.063 --> 29:09.956
Is anybody there?

29:10.032 --> 29:11.791
I'm trapped in the stop
off marker 65.

29:11.867 --> 29:13.292
Please...

29:13.369 --> 29:15.628
You gotta
be shitting me.

29:15.705 --> 29:16.963
What?

29:17.039 --> 29:18.622
Give that to me.

29:18.633 --> 29:22.134
I repeat... I'm trapped
in the stop off marker 65.

29:22.211 --> 29:25.421
Is there an ad for sunscreen
on the wall?

29:26.975 --> 29:29.800
I don't know.

29:29.811 --> 29:33.145
Is there an ad for sunscreen
on the wall?

29:35.725 --> 29:37.984
Yeah.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.769
Why? How did...
Did Alicia tell you I was here?

29:40.846 --> 29:43.322
She said
you could help me.

29:43.399 --> 29:45.658
You know this girl?

29:45.735 --> 29:47.109
No.

29:48.687 --> 29:52.448
Just a song
I've sung before.

29:55.745 --> 29:57.503
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.171
Are you there?

30:00.916 --> 30:04.010
This is what the people
I'm working with can prevent.

30:04.086 --> 30:06.503
You think
this is helping her?

30:06.514 --> 30:10.016
Giving some poor girl hope
you can't deliver on?

30:18.050 --> 30:21.360
You're on your own,
sweetheart.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.147
The sooner
you accept that,

30:25.224 --> 30:27.983
the sooner you'll understand
what you have to do.

30:29.937 --> 30:31.704
I...

30:31.781 --> 30:33.039
I can't kill them.

30:33.115 --> 30:34.540
There's too many.

30:36.619 --> 30:39.712
There's a gun
in there.

30:39.789 --> 30:43.215
Probably on the floor,
toward the back.

30:43.292 --> 30:46.502
Now, can you
see anything?

30:54.637 --> 30:56.887
Yes.
How did you know?

30:56.964 --> 31:00.057
Because I left it there.

31:06.482 --> 31:09.575
We've got more
by the tank.

31:23.499 --> 31:26.041
I couldn't stay
at the convoy.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.752
And we thought
you might want some assistance.

31:28.763 --> 31:30.429
"Want it"?
My friend, we need it.

31:30.506 --> 31:32.047
We're trying
to keep the dead

31:32.124 --> 31:34.258
on that far ridge
from falling in.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.592
You game?

31:35.603 --> 31:38.270
Come on.

31:43.018 --> 31:46.112
There's only one bullet in it.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.449
I know.

31:50.526 --> 31:52.943
I'm sorry.

32:19.847 --> 32:22.306
Don't be.

32:22.316 --> 32:25.267
It's better this way.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.041
You okay?

33:31.118 --> 33:32.718
Who's there?

33:34.630 --> 33:36.889
Name's Wes.

33:36.966 --> 33:38.715
I heard Alicia
on the walkie.

33:38.726 --> 33:39.892
She helped me.

33:39.969 --> 33:41.510
Figured I should
pay it forward.

33:49.812 --> 33:52.396
What happened there
before...

33:52.406 --> 33:54.573
I'm sorry.

33:54.650 --> 33:58.911
But that's no reason
to throw this all away.

33:58.988 --> 34:01.196
We help people.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.082
Come on.

34:11.166 --> 34:14.592
They help people.

34:14.670 --> 34:17.763
Hard to get
bigger than that.

34:30.069 --> 34:33.437
Alicia?

34:33.513 --> 34:35.397
You made it.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.324
I'm glad you're okay.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.870
This is Victor.

34:44.858 --> 34:47.576
I was hoping
you were listening.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.629
I was.

34:52.032 --> 34:54.425
What happened to
"people are people"?

34:55.543 --> 34:57.803
Sometimes they're not.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.973
And... I wasn't gonna just
listen to someone die

35:01.050 --> 35:02.349
over a walkie.

35:05.646 --> 35:08.314
I saw some of the trees
you've been painting.

35:08.390 --> 35:09.481
Oh.
Not bad.

35:09.558 --> 35:11.642
I like
the Phoenix thing.

35:12.895 --> 35:14.153
Told you.

35:14.229 --> 35:16.822
We shouldn't stay.

35:16.899 --> 35:18.324
They'll find me.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.825
Who?

35:19.902 --> 35:22.652
The place I'm from,
there are people there,

35:22.663 --> 35:26.281
people who I couldn't
be with anymore.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.284
I was trying to...
to get out.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.338
That's... That's why
I ended up here.

35:32.414 --> 35:34.673
Well, whoever
these people are,

35:34.750 --> 35:36.166
you're with us now.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.927
They're not gonna
bother you anymore.

35:40.747 --> 35:43.140
Let's go.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.690
Excuse me.

36:20.721 --> 36:23.931
This shit's worse
than a tequila hangover.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.945
Her I recognize
from the movie.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.857
Him?
Not so much.

36:41.933 --> 36:45.402
Well, we couldn't have
cleared the place without them.

36:45.479 --> 36:47.246
They're the people
we helped.

36:53.487 --> 36:55.203
No!

37:08.177 --> 37:10.218
Put the guns down,
Doris.

37:10.295 --> 37:11.762
You heard me.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.439
It's enough of
this horseshit already.

37:13.515 --> 37:16.224
You said
we were gonna take it all.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.559
Yeah.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.561
I did say that.

37:19.638 --> 37:22.230
I thought
we needed to.

37:22.307 --> 37:25.617
You said this would be
the ticket to the Promised Land!

37:25.694 --> 37:27.953
Still could be.

37:28.030 --> 37:30.739
If you
put the guns down.

37:41.210 --> 37:43.585
Okay.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.138
Shit happens.

37:46.215 --> 37:48.798
It makes you
question things.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.759
Then more shit happens,

37:50.835 --> 37:54.804
and you start to doubt
everything you were about.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.065
Some people do,
anyway.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.987
My partner,
Clayton...

38:02.064 --> 38:03.814
he never did.

38:03.890 --> 38:06.658
I may have
burnt his journals,

38:06.735 --> 38:09.611
but it's not gonna snuff out
what he was trying to build.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.321
What we were both
trying to...

38:17.079 --> 38:18.662
No!

39:00.780 --> 39:02.714
- You killed him.
- We had to.

39:02.791 --> 39:05.217
We do this kind of thing
for a reason,

39:05.294 --> 39:07.502
and we don't
do it lightly, ma'am.

39:07.579 --> 39:11.506
<i>A rio revuelto
ganancia de pescadores.</i>

39:11.583 --> 39:14.509
We all know
Logan was a liability.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.144
He couldn't be trusted.

39:17.306 --> 39:20.348
What do you know
about us?

39:20.425 --> 39:22.234
Well, you're not
exactly hermits.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.238
We've been watching you
for a while now.

39:26.315 --> 39:28.523
On and off screen.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.859
We like
what you're doin'.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.444
So much so

39:32.520 --> 39:34.204
we think there's a way
we can all help each other.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.706
The biggest weakness
in your operation

39:44.783 --> 39:47.259
is that
you think too small.

39:47.336 --> 39:49.210
Your convoy works...

39:49.287 --> 39:50.920
mostly.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.599
But "mostly" don't do it,
does it?

39:53.675 --> 39:56.593
Who are you
to tell us how to help people?

39:56.670 --> 40:00.096
Excuse us if we don't
take tips from a killer.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.891
Think of us more like
the pioneers.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.101
- "Pioneers"?
- Yes, sir.

40:05.178 --> 40:06.561
Settlers.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.272
Settling everything,
everywhere.

40:09.283 --> 40:10.732
It's no different

40:10.809 --> 40:12.734
than what you're doing
with your outposts.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.569
Only bigger.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.623
And, if I may,
better.

40:17.699 --> 40:20.950
You know, said the king-sized
catfish to the crappie.

40:20.961 --> 40:23.161
In a hundred years,
people may look back

40:23.172 --> 40:26.289
and think our methods
are ruthless and unkind,

40:26.300 --> 40:28.959
but there will be people
to look back.

40:29.035 --> 40:32.462
We got people everywhere
around these parts.

40:32.473 --> 40:36.308
You help us,
we can help you.

40:36.385 --> 40:38.593
Dwight...

40:38.670 --> 40:41.763
if your wife
is still alive,

40:41.840 --> 40:44.524
we can help you
find her.

40:46.553 --> 40:47.977
And, June...

40:47.988 --> 40:50.605
we can help you find

40:50.682 --> 40:53.659
that sweet little place
you've been looking for.

40:55.904 --> 40:58.446
You two need someplace
to brew, don't you?

40:58.523 --> 41:00.448
We can help you
find that, too.

41:00.525 --> 41:02.826
And we brokered a deal
with Logan

41:02.836 --> 41:05.787
to help us expand
what we've already built...

41:05.864 --> 41:08.957
to power it,
to fuel it.

41:09.034 --> 41:11.459
You help us
keep this place going,

41:11.536 --> 41:14.346
there's no telling
what we can offer each other.

41:14.423 --> 41:16.172
Together.

41:16.249 --> 41:18.183
You can take
that offer

41:18.260 --> 41:20.852
and shove it
straight up your poop chute.

41:20.929 --> 41:23.638
- Sarah...
- She's right.

41:23.715 --> 41:27.192
We just saw what you do
to people who take your deals.

41:27.269 --> 41:29.144
Well, we only eliminate
what is nonessential.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.362
From everything
we've seen,

41:30.439 --> 41:32.531
that doesn't describe
any of you.

41:32.607 --> 41:34.858
We'll take our chances
on our own.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.369
You want the gas?
You cook it yourself.

41:39.448 --> 41:40.822
Leaving us
high and dry

41:40.899 --> 41:44.534
without the very thing
we came here for.

41:44.545 --> 41:48.663
Well, that makes you all
much less essential.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.206
Don't...

42:27.821 --> 42:29.871
Wait.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.424
I can stay.

42:34.336 --> 42:35.585
Let them go.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.879
I'll help you make it.
I know how.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.598
We can
get out of this, Luci.

42:39.674 --> 42:42.092
We've gotten ourselves
out of worse scrapes.

42:42.168 --> 42:44.436
Luci, no.

42:47.015 --> 42:49.891
The journals are gone.

42:49.968 --> 42:53.728
But this way,
we can keep everyone going.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.114
We can
keep you alive.

42:59.828 --> 43:02.788
Now that sounds like
a deal to me.

43:05.125 --> 43:08.293
Give them
a tanker full of gas.

43:11.823 --> 43:14.591
We could do that.

43:15.827 --> 43:18.136
Use it.

43:18.213 --> 43:21.306
Find that place
everyone needs.

43:21.383 --> 43:25.635
And then,
prove these people wrong.

43:25.712 --> 43:28.638
Oh, honey,
I don't see that happenin'.

43:28.649 --> 43:32.484
If y'all change your mind,
do reach out.

43:32.561 --> 43:35.144
At the rate
we're expandin',

43:35.155 --> 43:37.155
you won't have a hard time
findin' us.
