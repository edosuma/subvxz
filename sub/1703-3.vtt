00:22.654 --> 00:25.324

00:25.358 --> 00:26.993
<i>The</i> <i>USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked...</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:28.961
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.466
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.867
<i>The next song</i>
<i>we're going to play for you</i>

00:33.902 --> 00:35.136
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:35.170 --> 00:37.607
Until something shocks him...

00:37.642 --> 00:40.444
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:40.478 --> 00:44.015
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:46.419 --> 00:47.654
<i>Running up...</i>

00:47.688 --> 00:51.358
We must... we will be vigilant.

00:57.999 --> 01:00.467
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:00.501 --> 01:02.469
God!

01:02.503 --> 01:04.470
<i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:04.504 --> 01:07.238
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:09.507 --> 01:11.308
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

Well, that's one interpretation,

01:30.928 --> 01:32.395
but that's all it
is at the moment.

01:32.429 --> 01:36.833
Jessica, it's me-- Brody.

01:36.868 --> 01:39.168
If he is a terrorist,
we need eyes and ears

01:39.203 --> 01:41.404
<i>on Brody from the minute</i>
<i>he steps off that plane.</i>

01:41.438 --> 01:43.006
Out of the question.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.241
The terrorists
are still out there.

01:44.275 --> 01:46.843
<i>We need Brody in the public eye</i>

01:46.877 --> 01:48.345
<i>reminding America</i>
<i>that this is far from over.</i>

01:48.379 --> 01:50.881
What if he's not up
for it-- psychologically?

01:53.986 --> 01:57.121
<i>Just a couple questions
,</i> <i>Sergeant Brody.</i>

01:57.155 --> 01:58.389
<i>You got ten seconds</i>

01:58.423 --> 01:59.756
to get off my property.
The...

02:05.229 --> 02:06.429
The brass sent you over here

02:06.464 --> 02:07.697
<i>to turn me into</i>

02:07.731 --> 02:08.931
<i>some fucking poster boy</i>

02:08.966 --> 02:10.066
for their bullshit war.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.368
Abu Nazir?
Was he ever present

02:11.402 --> 02:13.270
during any of your
interrogations?

02:13.304 --> 02:15.071
No.

02:16.907 --> 02:18.475
<i>You are the only Agency asset</i>

02:18.509 --> 02:20.577
to have had eyes on Nazir
in seven years.

02:20.611 --> 02:22.379
You know that they stone
women like me to death

02:22.413 --> 02:23.813
<i>if we get caught doing anything</i>

02:23.848 --> 02:25.148
<i>that we're not supposed to?</i>

02:25.183 --> 02:26.917
I won't let anything
happen to you.

02:26.951 --> 02:28.885
So Abu Nazir's resurfacing
just as Brody

02:28.919 --> 02:31.254
has miraculously returned
home means nothing?

02:31.288 --> 02:33.923
Dots are there, Carrie, but you
haven't connected them yet.

02:33.957 --> 02:36.058
<i>Wait, there's no
camera</i> <i>in the garage?</i>

Shh.

03:38.187 --> 03:40.255
Stay there.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.668
What are you doing?

04:27.702 --> 04:29.403
Nothing, Aamir.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.104
Just getting dressed.

05:19.858 --> 05:23.093
Oh, it's beautiful, Aamir.

05:23.127 --> 05:25.228
You're beautiful.

05:43.113 --> 05:45.348
I'd like to swap
out this couch, please.

05:45.382 --> 05:48.384
And the painting.
Something a little less Motel 6.

05:50.053 --> 05:52.588
I'll do what I did for the
McCain 2009 interview.

05:52.622 --> 05:53.822
Highest ratings ever.

05:53.856 --> 05:55.324
You know, I missed that one.

05:55.358 --> 05:56.792
I was out of the country.

05:56.826 --> 05:58.960
Of course.

05:58.995 --> 06:01.029
Okay.

06:01.064 --> 06:02.531
Oh, shit.

06:02.566 --> 06:04.000
Carrie, would you get in here?

06:04.034 --> 06:05.634
What is it?

06:05.668 --> 06:07.637
It's a crew member
from the network.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.339
They're about to move the couch

06:09.373 --> 06:12.208
where we have a contact mic
mounted to the baseboard.

06:12.242 --> 06:13.877
Holy mother of fuck.

06:15.012 --> 06:17.380
Okay, wait a second.
Wait a second.

06:17.415 --> 06:19.382
Can you...
you put that down?

06:19.417 --> 06:20.684
And can we get
the painting back

06:20.718 --> 06:21.851
on the wall, where it belongs?

06:21.886 --> 06:24.020
We'll stick with Motel 6.

06:24.054 --> 06:25.989
Just do it.

06:30.495 --> 06:32.496
All right, I'm going to be late
for my briefing.

06:32.530 --> 06:34.464
Let me know who wins.

06:37.702 --> 06:40.037
Look, we're broadcasting
a special here in two days.

06:40.071 --> 06:41.705
The homecoming
of an American hero.

06:41.739 --> 06:43.006
I know what the audience wants.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.808
You need to trust me.
No, I don't.

06:44.842 --> 06:46.710
Okay. Keep the couch.

06:46.744 --> 06:48.311
It's great. Let's just...
let's have you

06:48.346 --> 06:50.246
take a seat right
there, please.

06:51.582 --> 06:53.082
They back at it?

06:53.116 --> 06:54.583
Looks like.

06:54.618 --> 06:57.353
She has no idea who
she's dealing with.

06:57.387 --> 06:59.889
I had no idea he had such, uh,

06:59.924 --> 07:03.393
strong feelings
about home decor.

07:03.428 --> 07:05.096
It's probably
the only thing to him

07:05.130 --> 07:06.998
that seems the same.

07:07.032 --> 07:08.366
I kept everything
exactly the same

07:08.400 --> 07:09.867
the whole time he was gone.

07:12.906 --> 07:14.907
Not everything.

07:18.545 --> 07:19.946
I'm not going to
do this interview.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.714
It's a complete joke.

07:21.748 --> 07:23.582
They're trying to make us
into some perfect family.

07:24.918 --> 07:27.386
You are the perfect family.

07:27.420 --> 07:29.221
No, we're not.

07:29.255 --> 07:32.023
Well, not you, maybe,
but the rest of them.

07:32.057 --> 07:34.191
Your brother's a Boy Scout,
literally.

07:34.226 --> 07:37.361
Your mother, she's got
this whole MILF thing going.

07:37.395 --> 07:40.431
And your father--
I mean, Sergeant Brody,

07:40.465 --> 07:42.466
he's a hero.

07:42.501 --> 07:45.103
Yeah, <i>he</i> is.

07:45.137 --> 07:47.806
So leave the rest
of us out of it.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.242
Okay,
suggestion, if I may.

07:50.276 --> 07:53.045
Do the interview, right?

07:53.080 --> 07:55.047
But do something crazy.

07:55.082 --> 07:56.749
Like what?

07:56.784 --> 07:58.751
Light my hair on fire?

07:58.786 --> 08:00.620
Wear a burka.

08:00.655 --> 08:02.822
Every time the interviewer
asks a question,

08:02.857 --> 08:04.958
tell him to go
shut the fuck up.

08:04.992 --> 08:06.392
Mm-hmm.

08:06.427 --> 08:08.794
Look, the whole country
will be watching, right?

08:08.829 --> 08:11.564
And you can say
whatever you want.

08:12.632 --> 08:14.632
Tell the truth.

08:18.537 --> 08:21.539
The truth would be interesting.

08:23.042 --> 08:26.144
Intelligence work
has led us to this man.

08:26.179 --> 08:29.148
Prince Farid Bin Abbud,

08:29.182 --> 08:31.617
also known to his friends
as Freddie.

08:31.652 --> 08:33.820
We spent years chasing rumors

08:33.854 --> 08:35.989
that the prince
funded terrorists.

08:36.023 --> 08:38.291
But we've never had proof until
a meeting between the prince

08:38.326 --> 08:40.928
and Abu Nazir was videotaped
by this woman.

08:40.962 --> 08:42.629
Lynne Reed.

08:42.663 --> 08:44.030
A CIA asset and member

08:44.065 --> 08:45.965
of the prince's
personal retinue.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.533
We're running a hooker?

08:47.567 --> 08:49.835
If, by hooker,
you mean someone who's out there

08:49.869 --> 08:51.369
risking her life
while we're sitting

08:51.404 --> 08:53.104
around a conference table,
then yeah,

08:53.139 --> 08:55.706
we are.

08:55.741 --> 08:56.974
I just received word from her

08:57.008 --> 08:58.508
that she successfully
downloaded

08:58.543 --> 09:00.176
the prince's cell phone
onto an I-X chip.

09:00.211 --> 09:01.711
I'll be retrieving it
first thing tomorrow.

09:01.745 --> 09:03.012
Very good.

09:04.648 --> 09:07.016
So, immediately after
his meeting with Abu Nazir,

09:07.051 --> 09:08.985
the prince came here to DC.

09:09.019 --> 09:11.120
We believe the purpose
of his visit

09:11.154 --> 09:13.155
is to move funds
to one of Abu Nazir's people

09:13.190 --> 09:14.557
here in the United States.

09:14.591 --> 09:16.125
If we can flag the transfer,

09:16.159 --> 09:17.860
we can follow the money
to Nazir's operative.

09:17.894 --> 09:19.829
The prince is a global guy.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.631
He lives on that phone

09:21.665 --> 09:23.233
that Lynne Reed
just downloaded for us,

09:23.267 --> 09:26.803
so... should be
a good place to start.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.838
Questions.

09:28.873 --> 09:30.407
You say you
believe the prince

09:30.441 --> 09:33.142
is here for the purpose of
transferring funds. Why?

09:34.411 --> 09:36.045
Like I said,
the timing of the trip--

09:36.079 --> 09:37.713
following on the heels
of the prince's meeting

09:37.748 --> 09:39.482
with Abu Nazir in Cypress.

09:39.516 --> 09:42.185
My understanding is the prince
comes to the United States

09:42.219 --> 09:43.686
every year about this time.

09:43.720 --> 09:46.689
To top off his harem,
not to fund terrorism.

09:50.026 --> 09:52.261
Saul.

09:52.295 --> 09:53.996
What was that about?

09:54.030 --> 09:55.865
It was a legitimate question.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.167
So ask me offline.
Don't torpedo my briefing.

09:58.201 --> 10:00.503
It was a question, Carrie,
not an act of war.

10:00.538 --> 10:02.905
Abu Nazir's express goal
is an attack on our country.

10:02.940 --> 10:05.375
It's his holy grail.
No one doubts that.

10:05.409 --> 10:06.909
Well, half the reason
I think Abu Nazir

10:06.944 --> 10:08.444
has something
in the works now is Brody,

10:08.478 --> 10:10.012
and you know I can't
talk about that.

10:10.046 --> 10:11.547
So let me see if
I understand this.

10:11.582 --> 10:13.248
You think when
I ask you the same

10:13.283 --> 10:14.583
exact question I'd ask
anyone else, that really,

10:14.617 --> 10:15.851
I'm just giving
you a hard time?

10:15.885 --> 10:17.353
Is that it?

10:18.422 --> 10:20.690
Got a meeting to get to.

10:41.947 --> 10:43.514
Dana.

10:50.123 --> 10:51.490
Where were you?

10:51.524 --> 10:53.125
With friends.

10:53.159 --> 10:55.460
You missed the prep
for the interview.

10:55.495 --> 10:57.396
Yeah, that was
kind of the point.

10:57.430 --> 10:59.998
Hey.

11:00.032 --> 11:02.000
Sorry.

11:03.469 --> 11:05.503
Sorry.

11:08.507 --> 11:10.008
Can I go?

11:10.042 --> 11:11.976
No.
Sure.

11:17.448 --> 11:19.616
I didn't mean to
confuse things.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.819
So you know,
she's always like this.

11:21.853 --> 11:23.320
It's not you.

11:23.355 --> 11:25.189
You sure?

11:25.224 --> 11:26.591
Ask her to do anything,

11:26.625 --> 11:28.326
and the attitude
goes up like a wall.

11:28.361 --> 11:29.628
I mean, she's obviously got

11:29.662 --> 11:32.665
a secret life
going on out there.

11:32.699 --> 11:35.168
Well, she's 16.

11:35.202 --> 11:37.770
Only 16.

11:37.805 --> 11:39.939
Well, I meant, didn't you have

11:39.974 --> 11:41.975
a secret life when
you were that age?

11:42.009 --> 11:44.677
Yeah, with you.

11:44.711 --> 11:46.179
That was different.

11:53.887 --> 11:57.623
You want me to try
talking to her?

11:57.657 --> 11:59.391
Please.

11:59.425 --> 12:01.193
Be my guest.

12:15.877 --> 12:18.947
If I run into any trouble,
I'll send up a flare.

12:44.208 --> 12:46.042
- I don't know.
- It's funny, though, isn't it?

13:37.996 --> 13:39.563
You actually went swimming.

13:39.597 --> 13:41.965
I thought that was the idea.

13:58.617 --> 14:03.988
So what exactly are you
expecting to find on that?

14:04.022 --> 14:05.990
These operations
need money, right?

14:06.025 --> 14:07.992
You think it's
coming from Farid?

14:08.027 --> 14:09.594
He's certainly
got enough of it.

14:09.628 --> 14:11.663
So now we look for something
out of the ordinary

14:11.697 --> 14:13.432
on the download you got us.

14:13.466 --> 14:16.001
Electronic wire
with odd routing...

14:16.036 --> 14:17.503
a meeting he takes
with someone new,

14:17.537 --> 14:19.538
outside his usual circle...

14:19.572 --> 14:21.440
a transfer of money...

14:21.474 --> 14:23.008
I'll know it when I see it.

14:23.042 --> 14:24.510
Are you sure about this,

14:24.544 --> 14:26.344
about Farid being
part of an attack?

14:27.847 --> 14:30.115
Pretty much, yeah.

14:30.149 --> 14:33.351
Because I've been right
beside him for over a year

14:33.386 --> 14:36.154
and all I've seen is a nice
guy with a few sexual quirks.

14:36.188 --> 14:38.723
He gave me this amazing
necklace yesterday.

14:38.757 --> 14:40.391
He didn't have to,
he doesn't owe me.

14:40.426 --> 14:42.561
I swear, it actually
meant something to him.

14:42.595 --> 14:45.631
I'm sure it did.

14:45.665 --> 14:47.032
He's taking us all
clubbing tonight,

14:47.067 --> 14:48.467
to show off the new girls.

14:48.502 --> 14:51.037
That's what his
whole life is about.

14:51.071 --> 14:52.372
Just having fun.

14:52.406 --> 14:54.474
I know it must seem that way,

14:54.509 --> 14:57.477
but the man you recorded
him with, Abu Nazir,

14:57.512 --> 15:00.013
you know he's the real deal.

15:02.684 --> 15:05.585
We never would have been able
to get this any other way.

15:05.619 --> 15:08.187
You should feel really good
about what you've done.

15:09.689 --> 15:12.925
Well, I have downloaded
his phone for you.

15:12.959 --> 15:14.193
I'm done.

15:14.227 --> 15:16.495
What about you?

15:16.530 --> 15:18.864
Me? No.

15:18.898 --> 15:21.199
I'm never done.

15:32.112 --> 15:34.279
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your interview?

15:34.314 --> 15:36.516
They pushed it back
a couple hours.

15:36.550 --> 15:39.085
Are you nervous?
No.

15:39.119 --> 15:41.187
I was told Lawrence O'Donnell
gives everyone a hard time

15:41.222 --> 15:42.522
except guys in uniform.

15:42.556 --> 15:44.557
Chris! Dana!
Breakfast!

15:44.591 --> 15:46.258
So you know--

15:46.293 --> 15:47.927
Chris is all about
sugar in the morning,

15:47.961 --> 15:49.928
usually Cocoa Pebbles.

15:49.963 --> 15:51.430
Dana doesn't touch breakfast.

15:51.464 --> 15:54.533
It's as if you're
trying to poison her.

15:54.567 --> 15:57.703
So what were you two
talking about last night?

15:57.737 --> 15:59.538
Huh?

15:59.572 --> 16:01.539
I heard Dana laughing,
it was hard not to.

16:01.574 --> 16:03.141
What was so funny?

16:03.175 --> 16:05.943
Oh. It was this video
called YouTube.

16:07.412 --> 16:08.979
Have you seen it?

16:09.014 --> 16:11.149
The dog talking about food?
No, not that one.

16:11.183 --> 16:12.750
I saw a cat that smokes.

16:12.785 --> 16:14.619
It was really quite funny.

16:14.653 --> 16:15.954
Hey. Want some?

16:15.988 --> 16:17.455
No, thanks.

16:20.626 --> 16:21.926
I'll take some.

16:24.596 --> 16:26.931
Thank you.

16:33.304 --> 16:35.137
Looks good.

16:35.172 --> 16:38.140
Lack of porn is
a little surprising,

16:38.174 --> 16:40.108
given the prince's reputation.

16:40.143 --> 16:42.477
You know, at your briefing

16:42.511 --> 16:45.180
yesterday, I didn't
mean anything,

16:45.215 --> 16:47.282
calling your asset a hooker.

16:47.317 --> 16:48.751
Want to make it up to me?

16:48.785 --> 16:50.620
Find me evidence of
a money transfer.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.621
Start with the encrypted files.

16:52.655 --> 16:55.024
Really, it's important.

16:57.193 --> 16:59.695
Saul.

16:59.729 --> 17:01.597
I just picked up the
download from Lynne Reed.

17:01.631 --> 17:03.098
Anything there?
Crypto's processing it now.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.000
Hopefully we'll know
in a couple hours.

17:05.035 --> 17:07.203
Good. I got a meeting to go to...
Meeting to go to, sure.

17:08.672 --> 17:10.272
How long are you going
to keep doing this?

17:10.308 --> 17:11.942
When are you going to
forgive me for screwing up?

17:11.976 --> 17:14.545
I forgive you, Carrie.
No, you don't.

17:14.579 --> 17:16.446
I really don't want to
get into this here.

17:16.481 --> 17:19.782
I lied to you, it was
wrong, I understand that.

17:19.818 --> 17:22.219
Do you?

17:23.421 --> 17:26.190
Good.
Saul...

17:26.223 --> 17:28.458
Everyone lies in this
business, I accept that.

17:28.492 --> 17:29.959
But we all draw
a line somewhere,

17:29.994 --> 17:32.228
and the two sides of that
line are "us" and "them."

17:32.262 --> 17:34.330
And whatever we had, you and I,
whatever trust we built up

17:34.364 --> 17:35.798
over a decade of
me protecting you,

17:35.832 --> 17:37.199
teaching you everything I know,

17:37.234 --> 17:39.635
you destroyed it
when you lied to me

17:39.669 --> 17:41.003
and you treated me like "them,"

17:41.038 --> 17:44.207
like every other schmuck
in this building.

17:44.241 --> 17:46.009
Now, when you say
you understand,

17:46.043 --> 17:48.878
is that what you mean?

18:01.426 --> 18:04.228
What was it like, hearing
your liberators rolling in?

18:04.262 --> 18:05.496
Well, they flew in.

18:05.530 --> 18:06.930
Which I didn't
know at the time.

18:06.965 --> 18:08.398
I was in a pretty deep bunker,

18:08.433 --> 18:10.333
so I couldn't really
hear what was going on.

18:10.368 --> 18:13.703
Then I heard
a massive firefight.

18:15.271 --> 18:18.239
I knew there'd be casualties,

18:18.274 --> 18:21.843
but at the moment the door
to my bunker blew in,

18:21.877 --> 18:24.245
I still didn't know
which side had won.

18:26.882 --> 18:29.684
Then a flashbang went off,

18:29.719 --> 18:32.053
which blinded me.

18:34.290 --> 18:36.692
And I just braced for the end.

18:39.295 --> 18:41.863
It took a while to work out
what had really happened.

18:41.898 --> 18:43.197
That you were free.

18:43.232 --> 18:44.865
Yeah.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.567
Sergeant Brody, your
commanders showed us

18:46.601 --> 18:47.801
the results of your initial

18:47.836 --> 18:50.070
medical exam.
Yes.

18:50.104 --> 18:55.074
There's a section, "Scars and
Other Identifying Marks."

18:55.109 --> 18:57.510
It goes on for
nearly two pages.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.946
You were beaten.

19:02.249 --> 19:04.617
No...

19:04.651 --> 19:06.886
Yes.
Tortured.

19:09.491 --> 19:11.292
That's right.

19:11.326 --> 19:12.793
To what end?

19:34.316 --> 19:35.516
To what end?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.018
What did they want from you?

19:49.699 --> 19:53.769
They want you to lose faith.

19:53.803 --> 19:57.339
Lose faith in your country,
which they say is the devil.

19:57.373 --> 19:59.942
In your brother Marines, who
they say aren't coming for you

19:59.976 --> 20:01.977
because you have
no military value.

20:04.048 --> 20:05.848
In your wife,

20:05.883 --> 20:09.352
who they say's got her arms
wrapped around someone else.

20:10.187 --> 20:11.488
How do you resist that?

20:12.824 --> 20:15.191
You can't.

20:17.828 --> 20:19.863
Except by believing
that those people

20:19.897 --> 20:22.365
they want you to renounce,

20:22.400 --> 20:25.969
that they're keeping
the faith in you,

20:26.003 --> 20:28.972
and you owe it to
them to do the same.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.375
Semper fidelis.

20:41.721 --> 20:43.021
Yeah.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.034
Your father did his
interview this morning.

20:59.436 --> 21:00.836
Good.

21:00.871 --> 21:03.005
It is good, I think.
To talk about it.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.841
To ten million people?

21:04.875 --> 21:06.542
You think that's good?

21:06.577 --> 21:08.278
Okay.

21:08.312 --> 21:12.515
I get that you don't want to
do the interview with us.

21:12.549 --> 21:14.083
I don't really think
anybody wants to hear

21:14.118 --> 21:15.752
what it is I have to say.

21:15.786 --> 21:17.454
Thank you for your order.

21:17.488 --> 21:18.956
Please move forward
to the window.

21:21.293 --> 21:23.427
Welcome to Gaucho Taco.
We'll be with you in a minute.

21:23.461 --> 21:25.362
What's good here?

21:25.397 --> 21:28.032
Well, it's 59 cent tacos, Mom.

21:28.066 --> 21:30.235
I'm sure it's all delicious.

21:31.737 --> 21:34.039
Look, Dana, I know
this is hard.

21:34.073 --> 21:36.442
Your father was gone
for eight years.

21:36.476 --> 21:38.444
And now he's back.

21:38.479 --> 21:40.446
That's not it, Mom.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.248
He's back and there's a
camera crew at our house,

21:43.283 --> 21:45.451
when what we really
need is some privacy.

21:45.485 --> 21:48.053
But that's his job now,
to be a public figure.

21:48.087 --> 21:50.054
And it's our job to
be there for him.

21:50.089 --> 21:51.589
We owe him that.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.626
Dana, I do listen.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.394
I know you think it's phony,

21:57.429 --> 21:59.296
putting us up on stage,
and you're not wrong...

21:59.331 --> 22:01.832
Well, Mom, it'd be a lot less
phony if you weren't fucking

22:01.867 --> 22:03.801
his good friend Mike.

22:05.938 --> 22:07.305
I'm not.

22:07.340 --> 22:10.076
Oh, please, Mom.

22:10.110 --> 22:12.645
With your black sleazy thongs
always drying in the bathroom,

22:12.680 --> 22:15.081
and him coming over
to "help out."

22:15.116 --> 22:16.983
Do you really think
I'm an idiot?

22:22.991 --> 22:25.292
Dana, I thought he was dead.

22:25.326 --> 22:26.827
We all did.

22:26.861 --> 22:30.297
But he's not, Mom.

22:30.331 --> 22:34.501
And he comes home,
to this devoted wife,

22:34.535 --> 22:37.905
and everyone is in on
the secret except him.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.910
Nice. Welcome home.

22:45.814 --> 22:48.349
Dana!

22:48.384 --> 22:50.318
Dana.

22:50.353 --> 22:52.687
Your father can never
hear about any of this.

22:52.722 --> 22:53.955
It would really hurt him.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.957
Him, or you, Mom?

22:55.992 --> 22:58.360
Him, both of us,

22:58.394 --> 23:00.128
our entire family,
do you understand that?

23:00.163 --> 23:02.531
Dana, I need you to promise.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.702
Hi.
Hello.

23:10.039 --> 23:12.641
This must be Jessica and Dana.

23:12.675 --> 23:14.342
That's right, it's
my wife and my daughter.

23:14.376 --> 23:15.977
I just stopped by to say hi

23:16.011 --> 23:17.545
before the family
interview tomorrow.

23:17.579 --> 23:19.847
Give us a chance
to get acquainted.

23:19.881 --> 23:22.149
So...

23:22.184 --> 23:23.885
Good we're all here.

23:33.030 --> 23:34.397
You're late.

23:34.431 --> 23:35.698
Yeah, sorry.

23:35.733 --> 23:38.268
Where's Max?

23:38.303 --> 23:40.805
He went home when the shift
ended, like I should have.

23:43.809 --> 23:46.010
Please tell me
you found something.

23:46.044 --> 23:48.179
Well, as a matter
of fact, I did.

23:48.213 --> 23:49.580
Hello.

23:49.614 --> 23:51.383
This must be Jessica and Dana.

23:51.417 --> 23:52.851
Yes, my wife, my daughter.

23:52.885 --> 23:54.786
I just stopped by to say hi

23:54.821 --> 23:56.355
before the family
interview tomorrow.

23:56.389 --> 23:57.790
Is that...?

23:57.824 --> 23:59.825
Lawrence O'Donnell, I know.
Here, watch this.

24:01.628 --> 24:04.663
You know that family interview
they're all getting ready for?

24:09.235 --> 24:11.035
She knows.

24:11.070 --> 24:12.469
Dana does. About us.

24:12.504 --> 24:14.271
I mean, how?

24:14.306 --> 24:16.540
We were so careful.
When you said you "had something,"

24:16.574 --> 24:17.974
I thought you
meant something big.

24:18.009 --> 24:20.043
Well, this is big.
No, I mean like a bomb.

24:20.077 --> 24:22.445
Or a call from Abu Nazir.

24:24.981 --> 24:26.816
I picked up the downlink
from Lynne Reed today,

24:26.850 --> 24:28.885
and after all we went through,
there's nothing on it.

24:28.919 --> 24:30.754
I need to find something here.

24:30.788 --> 24:32.589
Hey, aren't you the one who's
always telling me to be patient?

24:32.623 --> 24:34.590
I don't have time
to be patient.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.292
I have three weeks left and
we're sitting around watching

24:36.326 --> 24:38.160
this, whatever it is,
this reality show.

24:38.195 --> 24:40.330
Hey, have you eaten?

24:40.364 --> 24:42.732
I noticed there's some
spaghetti in the cupboard.

24:42.767 --> 24:45.736
It's only ten years
past its expiration date.

24:45.770 --> 24:48.305
I'm sure it won't kill us.

24:48.340 --> 24:49.941
All right.

25:00.287 --> 25:02.354
So what do we do?

25:02.389 --> 25:04.089
Just wait for the prince?

25:04.123 --> 25:06.092
That's right, you wait,
and you look beautiful,

25:06.126 --> 25:07.493
and you try and enjoy yourself.

25:07.527 --> 25:08.995
Think you can manage that?

25:09.029 --> 25:10.263
I can certainly try.

25:10.297 --> 25:12.832
Here's a question.

25:12.866 --> 25:14.333
How do I get one of those?

26:03.249 --> 26:06.217
Are you all right?

26:07.386 --> 26:09.687
Yeah. Fine.

26:11.122 --> 26:13.157
It's all yours.

26:44.455 --> 26:46.189
Another bottle.

26:46.223 --> 26:48.892
Easy. Pace yourself.
I know.

26:48.927 --> 26:50.728
We have all night.

26:50.762 --> 26:51.996
You have two years.

27:03.442 --> 27:06.043
I'm not so sure about that one.

27:06.077 --> 27:09.212
His Highness says
she reminds him of you

27:09.246 --> 27:11.781
when you first started.

27:11.815 --> 27:13.983
His Highness has
a special favor to ask.

27:14.018 --> 27:15.585
A job he wants you to do.

27:15.619 --> 27:17.487
A job?

27:17.521 --> 27:20.323
He's meeting with a businessman
tomorrow-- a new acquaintance.

27:20.357 --> 27:22.391
He'd like you to go
there tonight

27:22.425 --> 27:23.993
and make the man feel welcome.

27:25.629 --> 27:27.430
Make him feel welcome?

27:27.464 --> 27:29.665
Aamir said that?

27:29.699 --> 27:33.603
He said he wishes
to make a good impression.

27:33.637 --> 27:35.705
Why didn't he tell
me that himself?

27:37.007 --> 27:40.309
The prince can be
excruciatingly indirect

27:40.343 --> 27:44.480
in making his wishes known--
but for that, he has me.

27:44.514 --> 27:47.816
Is there a problem?

27:49.018 --> 27:50.786
No.

27:50.820 --> 27:53.188
No problem.
Good.

27:53.222 --> 27:55.423
The driver's waiting.

27:55.457 --> 27:57.291
I need to freshen up first.

27:57.326 --> 27:58.826
Hurry.

28:10.006 --> 28:12.608
Hey.

28:12.642 --> 28:15.111
You awake?

28:23.220 --> 28:26.489
Brody, a lot's happened
in eight years.

28:28.259 --> 28:31.160
There's a lot we need
to talk about.

28:31.194 --> 28:35.865
I just want you to know that,
when you're ready, so am I.

28:35.899 --> 28:38.868
Do you hear me?

28:38.902 --> 28:41.369
Mm-hmm.

29:13.036 --> 29:15.404
I want to try again.

29:20.043 --> 29:22.244
Got any tomatoes?

29:22.279 --> 29:24.146
In the crisper.

29:27.718 --> 29:30.186
Any from this century?

29:30.220 --> 29:34.590
Uh, in the cupboard, there might
be a jar of something.

29:43.568 --> 29:45.969
No.

29:46.003 --> 29:48.672
Take yours off.

29:50.674 --> 29:53.677
Please, take it off.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.324
Let me.

30:39.358 --> 30:40.592
No.

30:40.626 --> 30:42.794
It's better if you don't.

32:05.582 --> 32:06.849
Hello.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.016
Hey, it's Lynne.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.284
Lynne, where are you?

32:09.319 --> 32:10.552
I'm out.

32:10.587 --> 32:12.121
Uh, it's getting weird.

32:12.155 --> 32:13.588
What do you mean?

32:13.623 --> 32:15.357
Did you find anything
on that cell phone?

32:15.392 --> 32:16.792
That transfer you were
talking about?

32:16.826 --> 32:18.427
No, not yet.

32:18.461 --> 32:19.895
I think I may have found it.

32:19.929 --> 32:21.898
They just asked me
to go entertain

32:21.932 --> 32:23.533
some new business acquaintance

32:23.568 --> 32:25.902
that the prince is
meeting tomorrow. Who?

32:25.936 --> 32:27.538
I don't know. It's somebody
he's trying to impress.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.239
You sound worried.

32:29.274 --> 32:31.275
Normally, we don't even
talk to any man

32:31.309 --> 32:33.544
but the prince, and they want me
to go meet him now.

32:33.578 --> 32:36.281
The backup--
they're going to be able

32:36.315 --> 32:37.782
to follow me, right?

32:37.816 --> 32:38.783
What?

32:38.817 --> 32:40.552
The people protecting me--

32:40.586 --> 32:42.087
where are they?
Yeah, they'll be right behind you.

32:42.121 --> 32:43.722
Don't worry, we have your back.

32:43.756 --> 32:45.824
Just keep your phone on.
We'll be able

32:45.858 --> 32:47.726
to track you that way.
Okay.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.594
Thank you.

32:53.966 --> 32:55.099
Her protection?

32:55.133 --> 32:57.067
Where's your van?

32:57.102 --> 32:58.802
Lynne's about to meet the
prince's new business partner.

32:58.837 --> 33:00.771
She's a welcome gift.
Carrie, what did you tell her?

33:00.805 --> 33:03.306
You heard what I told her.
What was I supposed to say?

33:03.341 --> 33:05.141
No, Estes didn't
give you a protection detail?

33:05.176 --> 33:07.010
Now, come on,
we finally got a break.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.317
I'm not seeing her phone.

33:14.351 --> 33:16.853
Why isn't this working?
I don't know.

33:16.887 --> 33:18.354
Just trace her.

33:18.388 --> 33:20.323
Since when did they make
R Street a one-way?

33:20.357 --> 33:22.659
Okay, we've got her.
Where's the map?

33:22.693 --> 33:24.995
Just give it a second, will ya?

33:25.029 --> 33:26.462
Okay.

33:26.497 --> 33:28.331
All right, she's still
at the club.

33:35.872 --> 33:37.173
Lynne Reed?

33:37.207 --> 33:38.474
Where we going?

33:38.509 --> 33:39.942
Hay Adams.
You been before?

33:39.977 --> 33:41.177
Many times.

33:41.211 --> 33:42.778
Careful.
Thank you.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.682
Nice hotel. Very nice.

33:48.485 --> 33:51.121
So how did you get hooked up
with these guys, may I ask?

33:51.155 --> 33:53.790
Okay, I get it,
none of my business.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.492
You're right.

33:55.527 --> 33:57.394
It's just they paid cash,
substantial tip in advance.

33:57.428 --> 33:59.196
I mean substantial.

33:59.230 --> 34:01.465
Wouldn't mind being on
the permanent list is all.

34:01.499 --> 34:04.667
Well, take care of me and I'll
put in a good word for you.

34:04.702 --> 34:06.903
Thank you.
You're very kind.

34:06.937 --> 34:09.237
Just leave me your card.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.699
Which way are they going?

34:36.733 --> 34:38.734
We're nearly there.
Which way are they going?!

34:38.768 --> 34:41.004
They're not going anywhere.
She's not moving.

34:41.038 --> 34:42.706
Where are they?
Behind the club.

34:42.739 --> 34:44.273
Turn there.
You think that's a good idea?

34:44.308 --> 34:45.408
Turn there!

34:51.081 --> 34:52.447
Shit.

34:53.884 --> 34:57.520
Carrie, Carrie, wait!
Carrie!

34:57.554 --> 34:59.355
Carrie, there is nothing
to be done here, okay?

34:59.390 --> 35:01.724
They made her.

35:01.758 --> 35:04.760
Come on, we can't be seen.

35:04.794 --> 35:06.195
Shit. Shit.

35:08.098 --> 35:09.966
Shit.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.238
Fuck.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.566
Where's your father?

35:42.601 --> 35:44.602
Don't know.

35:44.636 --> 35:47.071
Where's Dana?
Don't know that either.

35:47.105 --> 35:50.474
They drove off together
about a half hour ago.

35:50.508 --> 35:53.143
If she doesn't
do the interview,

35:53.177 --> 35:56.245
does that mean I don't
get to do it either?

35:56.279 --> 35:59.648
I mean, it's not that I don't
appreciate all that she does.

35:59.682 --> 36:01.849
It's just, you know,
there are some things

36:01.884 --> 36:02.917
that I don't appreciate.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.687
Yeah, so ignore them.

36:05.721 --> 36:07.656
Yeah, but it's...
I mean it's stuff

36:07.690 --> 36:10.191
that I don't think
anyone would appreciate.

36:10.226 --> 36:14.396
I mean, it's stuff that I don't
think you would appreciate.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.704
What are you looking for?

36:22.738 --> 36:24.205
You'll see.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.041
What are these?

36:26.075 --> 36:29.311
Historical artifacts.

36:30.646 --> 36:31.846
Look.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.117
You and Mom.

36:36.151 --> 36:37.652
Mm-hmm.

36:37.686 --> 36:39.387
Each padlock put
here by couples

36:39.421 --> 36:41.855
who thought they'd stay
together forever.

36:41.890 --> 36:44.358
I wonder how many did.

36:44.392 --> 36:45.993
Not many, I bet.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.968
Why are you even
showing these to me?

36:54.002 --> 36:56.505
Because it's never easy.

36:56.539 --> 36:58.507
A lot of things can happen.

37:00.543 --> 37:02.411
You know, when I went
over to Afghanistan,

37:02.445 --> 37:04.046
you were in third grade.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.248
Chris was about this size.

37:06.282 --> 37:09.418
Your mom and I were almost
still like newlyweds.

37:09.452 --> 37:12.420
That's what I took
over there with me.

37:14.790 --> 37:17.091
You were in a play that year.

37:17.125 --> 37:19.827
<i>The Wackadoo Zoo.</i>

37:19.861 --> 37:21.495
Oh, you were so good.

37:26.368 --> 37:28.169
I can't believe that
you remember that.

37:28.204 --> 37:31.406
Honey, it's practically all
I thought about for eight years.

37:33.276 --> 37:36.045
It kept me alive.

37:38.983 --> 37:41.518
But now I'm back.

37:41.552 --> 37:45.122
Now all those things that
kept me going, they've gone.

37:45.156 --> 37:48.025
All the people have moved on,
things have changed.

37:48.059 --> 37:51.228
And what's replaced it,

37:51.262 --> 37:53.797
well, doesn't make
any sense to me.

37:53.831 --> 37:55.532
Not yet, at least.

37:55.566 --> 38:00.436
You know, I'm kind of struggling
for things to hold on to.

38:00.471 --> 38:03.072
And your mom's struggling, too.

38:06.644 --> 38:09.746
You should cut her some slack.

38:09.781 --> 38:11.615
We both should.

38:17.655 --> 38:20.057
Yeah.

38:22.093 --> 38:24.262
So...

38:24.296 --> 38:27.064
why are you even doing
this stupid interview then,

38:27.099 --> 38:28.466
if things don't make sense?

38:28.500 --> 38:30.067
I don't know.

38:30.101 --> 38:32.036
Maybe just to keep the peace.

38:35.807 --> 38:37.174
What are you going to say?

38:37.208 --> 38:40.410
Well, I'm not going to lie.

38:40.445 --> 38:42.646
But I'm not going to
tell the truth, either.

38:42.680 --> 38:46.116
I'm not going to tell a
bunch of total strangers

38:46.150 --> 38:48.151
what I just told you.

38:58.896 --> 39:00.697
Hey.

39:00.731 --> 39:02.733
Go ahead.

39:13.378 --> 39:17.783
She was, um, DOA at Providence.

39:17.817 --> 39:19.184
Two rounds,
point-blank.

39:19.218 --> 39:20.952
Apparently, they
had her wearing

39:20.987 --> 39:23.889
some crown jewel type necklace
that's, uh, vanished,

39:23.923 --> 39:25.324
so local law enforcement
is saying

39:25.359 --> 39:26.826
it's a robbery gone wrong.

39:26.860 --> 39:30.029
That's good for us,
keeps us out of it.

39:30.063 --> 39:33.732
You get anything off
the prince's cell finally?

39:35.668 --> 39:37.969
Yeah, it fits.

39:38.004 --> 39:39.871
Saudis must have
made her somehow,

39:39.905 --> 39:41.906
decided to take her out.

39:53.220 --> 39:55.822
I want to talk to Prince Farid.

39:55.856 --> 39:57.758
DC police already did.

39:57.792 --> 40:00.361
I've got the interview,
if you want to see.

40:00.395 --> 40:02.396
You okay?

40:07.569 --> 40:08.936
This guy is a Marine, right?

40:08.971 --> 40:12.240
I thought they were
supposed to be on time.

40:12.274 --> 40:13.908
Okay, that's good, Tim.

40:13.942 --> 40:15.510
I like that there.
Keep that.

40:15.544 --> 40:17.945
Come on, let's go
put on your nice clothes.

40:23.284 --> 40:24.518
Hey.

40:24.553 --> 40:25.520
Hey.

40:25.554 --> 40:26.554
You ready?

40:30.160 --> 40:31.628
I'm gonna go change.

40:31.662 --> 40:32.662
Mike.

40:39.237 --> 40:42.906
Uh, uh... uh,
she was my employee.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.742
Uh, for nearly two years.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.211
And this necklace,
it was a present from you?

40:47.246 --> 40:48.613
Yes.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.149
To your employee?

40:51.183 --> 40:54.253
I'm told it was worth
quite a lot of money.

40:54.287 --> 40:56.755
She was worth a lot.

40:56.789 --> 40:58.757
To me.

41:00.860 --> 41:02.560
She was a beautiful soul.

41:02.595 --> 41:06.331
She-She would never
hurt anybody.

41:06.366 --> 41:09.668
So, wipe that look
off your face,

41:09.702 --> 41:12.104
and you find out
who did this to her.

41:12.138 --> 41:14.773
Find out!

41:15.808 --> 41:18.310
It continues in that vein.

41:18.344 --> 41:19.745
I need to talk to Farid.

41:19.779 --> 41:21.513
Not possible.

41:21.548 --> 41:23.616
If you don't trust me, you're
welcome to be in the room...

41:23.650 --> 41:24.784
It's not gonna happen, Carrie.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.152
They're at the airport by now,

41:26.186 --> 41:27.420
heading back to the Gulf.

41:27.454 --> 41:30.123
You let them leave?

41:34.161 --> 41:36.495
If it makes a difference,
State Department made the call.

41:36.530 --> 41:38.364
Said it wasn't worth
antagonizing the Saudis.

41:38.398 --> 41:39.631
Yeah, you mean

41:39.666 --> 41:43.302
she wasn't worth
antagonizing them.

41:43.337 --> 41:45.371
It hurts to lose
an asset, Carrie.

41:45.405 --> 41:46.772
I get that.

41:46.807 --> 41:48.107
But she's gone.

41:48.141 --> 41:49.809
And Abu Nazir
is still out there.

41:49.843 --> 41:53.779
What we need now is a
new way to find him.

41:55.815 --> 41:57.382
I'm sitting in the home of

41:57.417 --> 42:00.018
Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody,

42:00.053 --> 42:03.722
his wife Jessica, and his
two children Chris and Dana.

42:03.757 --> 42:06.858
A family that put a
yellow ribbon on the tree

42:06.893 --> 42:09.195
for eight years

42:09.229 --> 42:13.166
while Sergeant Brody was
presumed dead in Iraq,

42:13.200 --> 42:16.904
when, in fact, he was being
held as a prisoner of war

42:16.938 --> 42:19.039
under brutal conditions.

42:19.074 --> 42:23.010
So, a lot of adjustments
to make, I'm sure.

42:23.045 --> 42:25.179
How has the homecoming been?

42:28.183 --> 42:30.351
Well...

42:39.427 --> 42:40.694
It's been great.

42:40.728 --> 42:43.897
For all of us.

42:43.932 --> 42:47.201
It's been really, really great

42:47.236 --> 42:50.238
to have him back.

42:50.273 --> 42:52.909
And I hope it is for him, too.

42:52.943 --> 42:54.911
Coming home.

43:07.326 --> 43:08.593
Carrie Mathison.

43:08.627 --> 43:09.961
Yeah, they called.

43:09.995 --> 43:11.029
You police?

43:11.063 --> 43:12.797
State Department.

43:12.831 --> 43:14.532
Did anyone notify the family?

43:14.566 --> 43:16.734
Yeah, they're here.

43:16.769 --> 43:18.536
They are?
Yeah.

43:18.570 --> 43:21.539
Drove all night
from Sandusky, Ohio.

43:21.573 --> 43:23.875
Never been to DC before.

43:23.909 --> 43:25.877
What did you tell them?

43:25.911 --> 43:27.212
Nothing.

43:27.246 --> 43:30.649
It's all hush-hush.

43:30.683 --> 43:33.118
They're not idiots, though.

43:33.153 --> 43:37.557
They know her so-called job was
traveling with a Saudi prince.

43:37.591 --> 43:39.092
I don't think
there's any illusions

43:39.126 --> 43:40.660
what he was paying her for.

44:00.480 --> 44:03.248
<i>She wasn't just some escort.</i>

44:03.282 --> 44:04.750
<i>She worked for us.</i>

44:04.784 --> 44:07.619
<i>She gave her life</i>
<i>for this country.</i>

44:07.653 --> 44:09.421
That's what I wanted to say.

44:09.456 --> 44:11.857
That's what any human being
would say to these people,

44:11.892 --> 44:14.760
that she was good, that we
owed it to her to protect her.

44:14.795 --> 44:16.663
But I-I could not say that.

44:16.697 --> 44:20.301
I couldn't say that because
it's a secret; I'm not allowed.

44:20.335 --> 44:22.837
And I was thinking,
this is a fucked-up business.

44:22.871 --> 44:24.438
This is
a fucked-up business,

44:24.473 --> 44:25.439
and I...

44:25.473 --> 44:27.207
Are you done?
No.

44:27.242 --> 44:28.876
No, I'm just gonna keep
talking and talking,

44:28.910 --> 44:30.844
so you can't say you have
some meeting to go to

44:30.879 --> 44:32.646
or make up whatever other excuse
you're gonna make up,

44:32.681 --> 44:34.148
so you don't have
to deal with me.

44:34.182 --> 44:35.149
Carrie.

44:37.552 --> 44:40.655
Everyone's left.

44:40.690 --> 44:43.224
There's no meetings to go to.

44:49.933 --> 44:53.001
She called me from the club...

44:53.035 --> 44:54.602
ten minutes
before she was killed.

44:57.507 --> 45:00.876
She asked if I had protection
on her, and I said yes.

45:06.517 --> 45:09.752
What do you want me to say?

45:09.787 --> 45:12.989
It matters?

45:13.023 --> 45:16.392
It doesn't matter?

45:16.427 --> 45:18.228
Don't worry, it'll all be fine?

45:18.262 --> 45:19.429
Just say something.

45:19.463 --> 45:21.097
Because when you cut me out,

45:21.131 --> 45:23.867
I'm all alone out here
and I can't stand it.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.094
They made your informant.

45:50.128 --> 45:53.064
Killed her.

45:57.436 --> 45:59.437
And I didn't stop them.

46:09.347 --> 46:13.684
So, this transfer you had
everybody looking for...

46:15.587 --> 46:18.489
Never happened.

46:18.523 --> 46:20.524
And now they're gone.

46:24.797 --> 46:27.098
But the prince was so
broken up about her--

46:27.133 --> 46:30.102
really, really sad.

46:30.136 --> 46:32.505
I-I can't believe he knew
they were going to kill her.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.509
What made you think
he was even involved?

46:35.543 --> 46:38.278
The video of him with Abu
Nazir that Lynne Reed shot.

46:38.313 --> 46:40.681
Which was what exactly?

46:40.716 --> 46:43.951
Their conversation was benign,
what little we could hear of it.

46:43.986 --> 46:46.687
<i>An exchange of pleasantries.</i>

46:46.722 --> 46:48.957
<i>Nothing more.</i>

46:48.991 --> 46:50.991
<i>Maybe Abu Nazir</i>
<i>really went on that boat</i>

46:51.026 --> 46:52.359
<i>to talk to someone else.</i>

46:52.394 --> 46:55.496
Someone in the
prince's entourage.

46:55.530 --> 46:57.531
Someone without his means?

47:00.635 --> 47:03.270
If the prince
wants to fund something,

47:03.304 --> 47:05.605
he's got the resources.

47:05.639 --> 47:07.607
Not everbody does.

47:07.641 --> 47:11.110
You're looking for
a money transfer, right?

47:11.144 --> 47:14.546
<i>Transfer of money</i>
<i>from a nomadic culture</i>

47:14.580 --> 47:17.115
<i>that has always known</i>

47:17.149 --> 47:21.485
<i>jewelry is the easiest way</i>
<i>to move wealth.</i>

47:21.520 --> 47:24.655
<i>Tell me again about</i>
<i>the necklace she was wearing.</i>

47:27.526 --> 47:30.294
Five hundred thousand.

47:30.329 --> 47:33.097
Three-fifty.

47:34.767 --> 47:36.100
Four hundred.

47:47.547 --> 47:49.313
Where did the money go?

47:51.350 --> 47:54.318
Could be anywhere.

47:54.353 --> 47:56.821
Congratulations.

47:56.855 --> 47:58.756
Not many young couples
can manage

47:58.791 --> 48:01.259
their first home all cash.

48:01.293 --> 48:02.526
Thank you.

48:02.561 --> 48:04.528
I hope you'll be happy here.

48:04.563 --> 48:06.597
I'm, uh, I'm sure we will be.

48:18.643 --> 48:21.345
They say you get used
to the noise.

48:21.379 --> 48:22.713
We don't mind it.

48:22.747 --> 48:25.215
I like being close
to the airport.

48:25.250 --> 48:27.618
For us, it's perfect.
