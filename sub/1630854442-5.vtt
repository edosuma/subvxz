WEBVTT

00:03.712 --> 00:05.839
Oh, God. This can't be good.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.885
Bernard.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.054
- Did you miss me?
- What are you doing here?

00:13.054 --> 00:14.222
What's with all the theatrics?

00:14.222 --> 00:16.433
And why do you look like an old man
with pointy ears?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.393
It's-- I gotta be honest,
a little unsettling.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.478
I've been alive for 1,600 years.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.563
What's your excuse?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.772
You ever heard of moisturizer?

00:22.772 --> 00:24.649
Listen, I haven't seen you
since you disappeared

00:24.649 --> 00:26.526
from the North Pole
to that Elf Rumspringa.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.653
- Kribble-Krabble.
- Yeah, whatever. You never came back.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.405
Well, I met someone. A human.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.199
So I made the jump
and gave up eternal youth as an elf.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.909
And now I've got this thing,

00:34.909 --> 00:37.370
and it won't go away
no matter how many burpees I do.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.915
But, sadly,
I'm not here for giggles and stuffing.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.000
Brace yourself.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.668
I know. Simon is ruining Christmas.

00:43.668 --> 00:47.088
So, if you know that, why aren't you
at the North Pole kicking some Santa butt?

00:47.088 --> 00:50.008
Because it's not my job.
You know, I screwed up at first.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.384
And second and third.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.178
Simon will figure this out.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.555
You know, this is so you.
You know, being stubborn.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.224
No, no. This is so you.
Showing up at my house uninvited

00:58.224 --> 01:00.518
and freezing my family,
which is a new one.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.687
How did you-- How did you do that?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.190
My nifty little clicker.
Works on sea lions too.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.274
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.567
Mmm-- Oh!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.027
Whoa. What just happened?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.111
Something happen?

01:10.111 --> 01:14.657
Oh! Bernard! Oh, my goodness!
I'm so happy to see you!

01:14.657 --> 01:17.452
Carol. It's so great to see you.
You look great.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.997
I would not wanna be you
when she unfreezes.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.207
And I would not wanna be you

01:22.207 --> 01:24.709
when the word gets out
that you refused to save Christmas!

01:24.709 --> 01:26.920
I didn't refuse.
Listen, I retired.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.922
Yeah, theoretically, so did I.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.423
But when La Befana came to me,

01:30.423 --> 01:33.051
did I quibble-quabble
about leaving Kribble-Krabble?

01:33.051 --> 01:35.011
No! So Santa up!

01:35.011 --> 01:36.429
It was an accident anyway.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.890
Somebody slid off the roof and boom!
There I was.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.351
Of course you'd think that.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.685
- That's what happened!
- Come on.

01:42.685 --> 01:45.271
- I need that clicker.
- No, no. Change of plan.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.982
Scott, I need to show you something.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.879
Wow. What happened to all the color?

02:09.879 --> 02:12.465
Your little magic clicker,
you couldn't afford sepia?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.759
You're aggravating my hiatal hernia.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.886
Okay, Bernard.
You got my attention.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.471
I wandered into the History Channel.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.266
- He's coming.
- Who's coming?

02:21.266 --> 02:24.477
Oh... [chuckles] ...Bernard!
Oh, it's good to see you.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.480
Uh, I hope you don't mind.
I brought a cranky plus-one.

02:28.231 --> 02:32.527
Scott Calvin.
Aren't you a sight for immortal eyes?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.654
He's been throwing a little pity party
for himself.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.447
Thinks everything in his life is random.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.701
Oh. The Santa-blues.
Yes, occupational hazard.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.869
And, I'm sorry--

02:41.911 --> 02:44.038
- Who might you be?
- You could call me Santa,

02:44.038 --> 02:46.875
but it gets a little confusing
because there are a lot of us.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.585
I was the 17th Santa,

02:48.585 --> 02:50.962
so most just call me 17.

02:50.962 --> 02:55.091
And this is the Great Depression,

02:55.091 --> 02:57.051
which happened during my reign.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.721
So this is where you get to hang out.
Hey, good time.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.056
It wasn't easy, but we made do.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.893
We handed out oranges and socks.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.731
Yeah, my grandparents used to tell us
that story to make us feel ungrateful.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.025
That's what this is about, huh?
Make me feel guilty,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.985
so I'll go back and do my job.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.613
No, no, no. Being Santa is not a job.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.114
You chose the wrong replacement

03:18.114 --> 03:20.200
because you weren't supposed
to step down yet.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.660
Okay, well, how was I supposed to know?

03:23.161 --> 03:26.623
You were supposed to feel it. Here.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.418
That's acid reflux.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.586
He deflects a lot.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.214
I think we all know
that I screwed up, right?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.925
Which means I'm not the guy to fix this.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.553
You know, I'm gonna go back to my world
where it's in full color,

03:40.553 --> 03:43.640
but I am gonna get a tuberculosis test,
just in case.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.351
They probably got a quick thing
at the pharmacy.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.144
What is this now?

03:48.144 --> 03:49.520
<i>Feliz Natal!</i>

03:49.520 --> 03:50.980
Holy Santa.

03:50.980 --> 03:56.027
Papai Noel. Uh, I have so many questions...

03:56.736 --> 03:57.987
Merry Christmas, kids.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.284
Boy. Where is the mule smell
coming from? Because...

04:04.369 --> 04:07.247
Krampus!
Listen, how do I get back to Chicago?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.249
The door.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.086
Okay, great.
Taking kids' toys... always good.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.046
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.092
Oh. You troublemakers again.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.470
- Is this, like, "Santasia"?
- No, it doesn't have a name.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.596
-"Kringleville."
- No.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.306
- The "Yule-verse."
- Stop trying to name it.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.058
You don't remember me, do you?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.729
You're the Santa that fell off my roof.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.898
You here to sue me or something?

04:33.898 --> 04:36.651
That night on your roof
was not the first time we met.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.321
<i>Jolly Old Saint Nicholas ♪</i>

04:40.321 --> 04:41.406
Oh.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
<i>Lean your ear this way ♪</i>

04:43.366 --> 04:45.285
Wow. This is the house I grew up in.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.787
This is me right here.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.547
I knew it! You are real!

04:57.547 --> 04:58.631
Ho ho ho.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.635
Scotty Calvin. The boy with the long list.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.596
You know, Santa doesn't bring you
everything you want.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.557
The bike isn't for me. It's for Jimmy.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.893
And the doll is for Angela,
the rosary for Sister Mary,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.729
and the slow cooker for my parents.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.898
I thought if I got them what they needed,
they'd believe, like I do.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.652
Why did you believe in me
when you had never seen me before?

05:19.652 --> 05:21.487
I felt it in here.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.197
Like a little whisper.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.867
Most people forget the magic of Christmas

05:25.867 --> 05:28.911
and how it makes them feel
like anything is possible.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.790
So, I'll forget? Like my parents?

05:32.790 --> 05:36.044
Adults have a harder time believing
in things they can't see.

05:36.753 --> 05:43.593
But one day, I think that you are going
to make this world a much better place.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.263
I don't remember any of this.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.724
Well, you know how it goes.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.810
You dusted me? I was a little boy.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.146
This is probably why I'm horrible at math.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.814
Why didn't you tell me about this?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.525
Believing is seeing.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.531
Whoa!

06:05.531 --> 06:07.241
Okay. Where are we now?

06:08.117 --> 06:10.453
What is this, like, the clubhouse
for the Yule-verse?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.704
Stop calling it that.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.916
Oh, look at that! Saint Nicholas of Myra.

06:14.916 --> 06:19.921
I don't think it looks much like me,
but what are you going to do?

06:19.921 --> 06:21.881
- Bernard. Now what's this?
- Just pay attention.

06:21.881 --> 06:26.511
It was never about gifts.
It was about giving!

06:26.511 --> 06:28.471
Saint Nicholas, his parents died.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.808
He became quite wealthy,
and then gave all his money away

06:31.808 --> 06:35.019
- to help those in need--
- I thought I was telling my story.

06:36.062 --> 06:40.942
Anyway, life was hard during that time.

06:41.526 --> 06:45.321
Parents couldn't always shield the
children from the horrors of the world,

06:45.321 --> 06:51.285
so I found ways to give back
with food, candy.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.454
Small joys.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.998
Life's kindling.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.708
You gave them what they needed.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.544
Hope.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.630
If you'll excuse me,
I've actually got some rounds to finish.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.382
Oh, you're leaving already?

07:04.382 --> 07:06.717
I've never really been gone, Scott.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.095
I live through you.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.265
Remember, it's all about the giving.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.933
The giving.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.646
Wow.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.357
Hey, no big deal.
I was just with Saint Nicholas,

07:21.357 --> 07:24.277
then he disappeared in a puff of smoke
like at an Elton John concert.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.821
Oh, yes. He is very impressive.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.616
His undertaking injected true magic
into the world.

07:30.616 --> 07:34.537
And from that magic emanated
the world of Claus and elves,

07:35.037 --> 07:36.497
- ethereal beings...
- Wow.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.416
...who carried on the mission.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.625
Ethereal?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.587
- I wondered about that. Am I ethereal?
- Nope.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.591
You are a regular human man
with many, many faults.

07:46.591 --> 07:50.595
Each Santa was chosen
to meet the challenges of their times.

07:50.595 --> 07:55.099
Now, during my final years...
...technology was becoming the new magic.

07:55.099 --> 07:59.979
I thought only a human
could meet the new challenges.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.023
A special human.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.442
The clauses were created to guide you.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.694
The Santa Clause,
the Mrs. Clause, all of 'em.

08:06.694 --> 08:10.239
If I'd known at the time, I would've
put in the, uh, Less Talking Clause.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.158
Wait a minute.
I'm here because of an accident.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.577
I saw you slip off the roof. You fell.

08:14.577 --> 08:20.041
You think someone yelling,
"Hey," really made me slip and fall?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.627
I'm Santa, baby!

08:22.627 --> 08:25.463
I have been on millions of roofs.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.548
No Santa's gonna slip off of a roof.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.592
That would be horrible.

08:29.592 --> 08:33.679
But that-- Wait a minute,
am I the first human Santa?

08:33.679 --> 08:36.807
I thought a human Santa
could raise his family in the North Pole,

08:36.807 --> 08:40.311
and perhaps those kids
would inherit the magic of the North,

08:40.311 --> 08:42.313
making the passing of the torch

08:42.313 --> 08:46.359
less up to the whims of a bunch
of pompous ethereals.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.736
My kids don't have any magic powers.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.488
You sure about that?

08:52.073 --> 08:54.367
<i>Jolly Old Saint Nicholas ♪</i>

08:54.367 --> 08:55.493

09:00.540 --> 09:03.042

Ah! Damn it, now he's got me saying it.

09:13.344 --> 09:17.932
Betty, breaks my heart seeing you
making toys like a common elf.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.102
No elves are common, Pontoon.
It's fine.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.105
Look, I even made a nice truck.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.985
Hey, what's with the lame toys?

09:29.485 --> 09:31.279
Cody Pugh asked for a truck.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.572
Cody Pugh.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.532
He doesn't have a NowAccount with us.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.702
I know. He sent a Christmas list
through the mail.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.871
The mail? Was he writing from 1987?

09:40.871 --> 09:42.707
We still have to get
the Christmas orders out.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.709
As in, like, chimney drops and "ho ho ho"?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.628
No, no, no. That doesn't quadrate
with our vision anymore.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.422
- But what--
- No, there's no buts, okay?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.715
I'm Santa. What I say goes.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.468
This isn't Christmas, Betty.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.137
You can't think like that, Pontoon.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.763
If you lose your hope, you'll disappear.

09:58.639 --> 10:02.602
You can be as sad as you want
if you wear one of these bad boys.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.404

Why didn't you lead with that?

10:13.404 --> 10:14.488
Don't you see?

10:14.488 --> 10:16.532
Everything is connected
to Christmas spirit,

10:16.532 --> 10:18.743
going all the way back
to Jolly Old Saint Nicholas.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.329
I thought I was doing the right thing.
The job was getting difficult.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.622
I assumed it was me.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.333
The job has always been difficult.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.794
I delivered gifts during drought, colonization.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.421
Try the Dark Ages.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.050
Big deal. I had the Great Depression,
World War II, Vietnam,

10:34.050 --> 10:36.135
and the <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i>.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.389
- I'm such an idiot.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.183
I gotta go back to the North Pole.

10:42.183 --> 10:46.604

to regret giving a human all this power.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.565
Yeah, humans always disappoint.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.234
Might I-- Might-- Can I just--
Can I say something?

10:52.234 --> 10:54.987
No, no, no, because it's gonna be mean.
It's gonna be mean.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.239
None of you were a picnic, okay?

10:57.239 --> 10:59.742
You all thought you knew the best way
to run things, and you didn't.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.952
And the elves always picked up your slack.

11:01.952 --> 11:06.791
Now, I was against this whole Scott
experiment from the very beginning.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.459
I told you this is gonna be mean.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.462
Entrusting the fate of magic
to human hands?

11:11.462 --> 11:14.423
Honestly, that sounded like
the end of the world to me.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.218
- Like totally apocalyptic.
- Ooh. Is there an end to this?

11:17.218 --> 11:22.598
Year after year, I kept expecting
Scott Calvin to flame out.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.226
- To give up. But he always kept going.
- Mmm.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.980
That kid that wanted
to get people what they needed,

11:29.980 --> 11:31.482
so that they could believe.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.818
Now, you may all have picked him
for the job,

11:33.818 --> 11:36.195
but Scott chose to be Santa.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.989
The best Santa I ever saw.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.702
Now, I haven't been around lately...

11:42.702 --> 11:46.539
...because, uh,
well, I got married, to a human.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.165
Yeah, look at that.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.000
That's Vanessa Redgrave. She's, like, 85.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.212
We're several hundred years apart,
but we still find things to talk about.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.089
- Now, that's a good couple.
- Congrats.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.052
All right. [stammers] Time's running out.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.638
That thing's gonna get you back
to the North Pole.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.683
- Right. I gotta stop by my house first.
- I know. Go out the way you came.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.727
Listen, you're irritating as usual.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.312
I didn't enjoy a single second
of this either, sir.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.397
Come on. Anyway.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.024
Can't believe you got married
to an Oscar winner.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.943
Tell her I said "hi." I gotta go.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.278
Well, I gotta run.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.779
Hey. Good, good. Gotta go.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.744
Hey, Krampus.
You doing something new with the horns?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.704
Thanks for noticing.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.710
Oh. Wait. Scott?

12:33.335 --> 12:35.504
What's going on? Where's Bernard?

12:35.504 --> 12:37.715
Uh, about that.
You won't believe where I gotta go.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.803
It brings me no pleasure to report
that if Christmas spirit dips any further,

12:42.803 --> 12:45.389
then the delivery system
might stop working altogether.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.017
You said you could run this with science.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.895
I said I can run it with mainly science
and a little bit of magic.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.481
So make more.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.650
I can't just make magic.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.111
People would need to believe in magic.
In Christmas.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
I'm surprised the system is still working!

13:02.656 --> 13:05.785
There must be some magic source
from within the North Pole. I just--

13:06.285 --> 13:07.953
I just can't figure out where it is.

13:17.546 --> 13:18.422
Oh, wow.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.966
I was decorating for Mom.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.010
Christmas was always her favorite time.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.014
She once told me that she wished
she could bottle that Christmas feeling

13:27.014 --> 13:29.391
so she could use it
on those other days that get you down.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.269
- Christmas Every Day!
- Yes! That's right.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.980
Gosh, I wish she could see all of this
coming true.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.526
She sees us, Dad. She knows.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.364
Christmas decorations.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.784
I know it's July. I just needed it.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.786
I mean, they're perfect.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.288
How are you feeling?

13:52.414 --> 13:57.920
Tired, sad, mad, happy...

14:00.631 --> 14:03.217
thankful. You name it.

14:03.884 --> 14:08.222
You know, your little girl tried so hard
to stay up for you.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.473
I'm sorry.

14:10.474 --> 14:14.228
Promise me, here,
that you will give Grace the best life.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.106
Oh, come on. I'm gonna give her the world.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.483
Hey, Dad.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.987
If Christmas Every Day is
supposed to make people happy,

14:22.987 --> 14:25.197
why is everyone around here so sad?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.783
Oh, they're not-- No, they're not sad.

14:27.783 --> 14:32.162
Uh, it's just that change,
even good change, can be hard at first.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.331
But things will be better
than they were before. You'll see.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.543
Hey, how about a little marshmallow?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.211
Oh, no, no, no.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.006
They don't have
the marshmallow ones anymore.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.342
So, long story short,

14:45.342 --> 14:48.804
I retired too soon. I hired the wrong guy.
I've gotta go back to the North Pole.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.973
But we were finally gonna have
Christmas together.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.100
We will do it next year.
I promise. I promise.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.269
But we have a life now.
And the kids love it here

14:55.269 --> 14:57.229
and I finally have a name.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.898
And it-- And it's Principal Carol!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.275
I love it here too,
but as I told you guys,

15:01.275 --> 15:04.778
I spent some time in this realm,
the Yule-verse.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.322
- No, that's a--
- Huh?

15:06.322 --> 15:07.573
That's a terrible name.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.450
- The Yule-verse. Say it. It's beautiful.
- No.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.535
Yule--
No, it's even worse the second time.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.830
It should be something like SantaLand.
Or like-- Oh, oh, Sant-lanta.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.124
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, so, what about "Claus-mopolis"?

15:17.124 --> 15:19.877
- Oh, yeah!
- I like that, but "Chris-Mesopotamia."

15:19.877 --> 15:21.503
- Oh, yeah! Now, that's good.
- That's excellent.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.339
That's not excellent.
There's too many syllables--

15:23.339 --> 15:28.052
We're off subject. The subject is,
Simon is destroying Christmas spirit.

15:28.052 --> 15:32.056
I have felt something was off,
but I thought it was just my acid reflux.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.350
It's weird. I've been feeling
the same thing. You know what else?

15:34.350 --> 15:37.227
The Santas in the Yule-verse, ah, told me,

15:37.227 --> 15:39.188
since you kids were born
at the North Pole,

15:39.188 --> 15:41.941
you may have magic powers.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.233
Us?

15:46.654 --> 15:48.238
That was their hope

15:48.238 --> 15:52.618
with the first and only human family
from the North Pole.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.829
Okay, no. Back up.
Wha-- You left that part out.

15:55.829 --> 16:00.501
All the clauses,
all of them were created for us.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.128
So, I was the first Mrs. Claus?

16:04.171 --> 16:05.422
I didn't ask.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.340
Of course you didn't.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.384
So what you're saying is that

16:08.384 --> 16:12.179
we were the first human family
at the North Pole.

16:12.179 --> 16:17.601
That we were specifically chosen
for this time.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.021
Well, that changes everything.
We have to go back.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.691
No, that's not-- Listen.
It's too dangerous.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.275
Elves are disappearing. I can't have you--

16:25.275 --> 16:27.486
Elves are disappearing?
You should have led with that!

16:27.486 --> 16:29.780
No. We're part of this. We're going.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.240
All right. Let me think about this.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.034
Um, go get some stuff together.
I will think of a plan down here.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.619
- You're right. Yeah. Okay.
- Cool. Okay.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.788
- What are we gonna get?
- We'll be right back.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.039
Who wants ice cream?

16:39.039 --> 16:40.165
I didn't eat any.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.334
Some of the cartons
just come already licked clean.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.169
Come here. Listen.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.505
- I don't want the family to hear this.
- Okay.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.383
Going to the North Pole.
We're gonna stop Simon.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.635
Now we're talking.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.183
Home. It's so quiet.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.643
Where are the reindeer?

16:59.643 --> 17:01.478
I don't know,
but they left a little gift for me.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.188
Nice landing spot, Orb.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.984
Listen. We gotta round up
everybody who's still here

17:06.984 --> 17:09.153
and go set Simon straight, okay?

17:09.153 --> 17:13.032
Don't be mad,
but I kinda need to find Betty first.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.367
I've realized she's the most important one
in my life.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.454
It's been a little weird
it's been me for so long.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.330
All right. I'll meet you later.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.166
I'll grab a couple snacks
from the kitchen!

17:22.166 --> 17:24.835
- Are you guys gonna be warm enough?
- I'm good. I'm good. Thank you.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.420
Where's-- Where's Dad?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.838
Huh? Where is he?

17:27.838 --> 17:30.758
Uh, I-- I think he left us.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.092
I'm gonna kill him.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.386
Oh, well, no, Mom, you can't kill Santa...

17:34.386 --> 17:36.472
...'cause then you'd become Santa,
and how would that work?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.891
- Hi.
- Hey, hey, hey.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.309
Hey, Riley.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.228
- I am so excited about game night.
- Hey.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.439
Although, I do hope
that we're not playing Flip the Sheep.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.857
That game led to my parents' divorce.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.862
Oh, no. I'm sorry, something's come up.
I'm not sure we can do game night.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.988
Oh. No bigs.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.406
Wonderful.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.910
Oh, my gosh, Sandy, cute shirt!
Where is that from?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.244
Uh...

17:59.244 --> 18:01.038
Found it, ordered it,
should be here any second.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.539
What? Uh, how?

18:02.539 --> 18:04.792
Well, it's Christmas Every Day
with EverythingNow!

18:04.792 --> 18:08.462
With a NowAccount, you just press
Insta-Deliv and bam. Immediate delivery.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.172
Oh! It's here.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.387
Thanks, drone.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.767
- I'm gonna go try this on.
- Sure. Go ahead.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.895
She's gonna look amazing in that.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.147
Christmas Every Day?

18:27.147 --> 18:29.775
This is how
he's destroying Christmas spirit.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.195
And where did all these drones come from?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.114
And how did they get here so quickly?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.865
Oh, through the hole in the sky.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.119
- Hole? There's--
- What?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.787
- There's nothing there.
- Uh-uh.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.707
I'm telling you, there's a ripple
in the sky, like a vortex.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.502
All the drones are coming from there.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.462
Okay.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.089
He can see what Dad sees.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.717
Okay. We need to get back
to the North Pole to help your dad.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.345
If only we could get back
through that vortex.

18:58.345 --> 19:03.684
Um, well, I have an idea,
but you may think I'm crazy.

19:03.684 --> 19:07.479
Oh, sweetheart.
Crazy lost all meaning a long time ago.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.566
Betty? Doc? Hazel?

19:12.776 --> 19:13.819
Pudding?

19:13.819 --> 19:14.903
Goose?

19:15.946 --> 19:16.989
Bob?

19:18.448 --> 19:19.449
Crumpet!

19:19.449 --> 19:21.160
Noodle? Percy?

19:21.785 --> 19:22.911
Peppermint?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.705
Nougat?

19:24.705 --> 19:25.789
Beans?

19:26.665 --> 19:27.666
Churro?

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
That's really pretty, Grace.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.183
Thank you.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.685
It's getting so quiet around here.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.188
Is it true the elves are disappearing?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.274
Yes.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.860
Will they come back?

19:56.612 --> 19:59.114
Elves were born
of Christmas spirit itself.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.241
And it's not as strong as it used to be.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.703
They could be gone forever.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.747
I wanna help. I miss Edie.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.875
You just have to believe.

20:10.751 --> 20:14.671
Believe with all your heart in the spirit
of Christmas and all that is good.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.048
That's the secret.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.259
I believe, Betty.
And I'll tell my dad too.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.594
He'll definitely wanna help.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.180
I'm sure he will.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.850
I should get back to work.

20:47.788 --> 20:48.914
Betty?

20:50.749 --> 20:51.750
Betty?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.252
Honeybuns?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.672
So I have to go away for a while,

20:56.672 --> 21:00.509
and I can't tell you where,
and I'm not sure when I'll be back.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.680
Wow.
You're just like all the other guys.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.891
I promise you I'm not,
but I can't really get into this--

21:07.891 --> 21:09.059
Wait, what other guys?

21:09.059 --> 21:12.854
Just tell me the truth. Whatever it is.
You owe that to me.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.690
Okay. Okay. Um...

21:15.482 --> 21:20.779
My dad is, or was,
but might be again, Santa Claus.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.533
And me and my family have to go back
to the North Pole to save Christmas.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.744
- Goodbye.
- Wait.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.747
Listen, I understand
if you never want to talk to me again,

21:30.747 --> 21:33.500
but please just do me
this one favor, okay?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.918
Stay up on Christmas Eve,

21:34.918 --> 21:37.504
and if me and my family make it
through all this,

21:38.171 --> 21:42.092
Santa will come down your chimney,
and then you'll see it's really my dad.

21:43.593 --> 21:48.557
I don't believe in Santa,
so why would he come down my chimney?

21:49.141 --> 21:51.893
To give your little brother
the Loki Funko Pop he wants.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.479
How do you know that's what he wants?

21:55.564 --> 21:58.984
I don't know. I just-- I just do.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.369
Stop! Invader!

22:09.369 --> 22:12.372
Calm down. Calm down.
Gary, it's me. Look at me.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.457
Listen to my voice.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.709
You look terrible.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.712
I know. I know.
Listen, Christmas is in trouble.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.006
I know you pledged your loyalty to Simon,
but I need your help.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.050
That nitwit? [chuckles] Hardly.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.760
Excellent. Excellent. All right.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.096
We're gonna need the old crew
off the toy line.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.182
I'm the only one left, chief.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.100
Okay, well--

22:32.100 --> 22:35.479
I told 'em all to wear these foil caps
so they don't disappear.

22:35.479 --> 22:39.441
They laughed at me,
but here I am, at your service.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.485
I'm really happy you're on board.
I need your help.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.569
You know me.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.405
I'll do anything to help you
and save Christmas.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.782
All right, good. Let's go.

22:46.782 --> 22:50.535
Now?
I'm sort of on my cocoa break.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.329
Hey, Gary, put the cocoa down.

22:54.039 --> 22:58.543
Butter, what if I told you
that you could fly like Santa's reindeer?

22:58.543 --> 22:59.961
No.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.131
All animals can fly.
They just gotta believe that they can.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.800
She can't be serious.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.468
Oh, Cal, don't be a naysayer.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.719
I'm not. The horse is.

23:08.303 --> 23:11.014
She's gonna get us killed.
I cannot die before my first kiss.

23:11.014 --> 23:13.100
Oh. I-- I believe in Sandra.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.351
I believe in you both.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.853
Oh, those are real nice last words, Mom.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.981
We gotta find Simon
and talk some sense into him.

23:19.981 --> 23:22.109
He's not the same Simon you knew.

23:22.109 --> 23:25.070
Apparently not. Dude needs a decorator.
What is this?

23:25.070 --> 23:27.447
Can't be that bad of a guy.
He's got this beautiful little tree.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.532
Tinsel's a little off.

23:29.366 --> 23:32.869
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey! Hey!
- I was gonna say, "Don't touch that."

23:32.869 --> 23:34.371
And yet, you didn't.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.540
<i>Intruder! Intruder!</i>

23:36.540 --> 23:39.918
Oh, yeah.
Forgot to tell you about these clodpolls.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.462
Don't shoot. We're unarmed.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.048
I can't believe I fell for the Santa trap.

23:45.048 --> 23:49.261
Me either. Especially because,
technically, you're not Santa anymore.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.722
I wonder if the elves actually disappeared
or they just ran away from you.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.353
Okay. Ready?

23:58.353 --> 23:59.646
To die? Why not?

23:59.646 --> 24:01.273
Yes, sweetheart.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.941
I was talking to the horse.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.609
This seems like a horrible idea.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.405
I gave Butter a pep talk,
but he doesn't seem to be buying it.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.990
Oh, what's not to buy?

24:09.990 --> 24:13.660
A plain old horse flying us through a hole
in space that only Cal can see.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.829
The same Cal who flunked his driving test

24:15.829 --> 24:18.039
because he couldn't see
the dozen orange cones.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.417
Let's go!

24:21.376 --> 24:23.503
Come on, Butter. You can do this.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.588
Hi-yah!

24:28.842 --> 24:31.636
Okay, Sandra's clearly better
at driving a sleigh than me,

24:31.636 --> 24:34.848
but maybe we should've taken
two seconds to come up with a plan B?

24:34.848 --> 24:37.726
She's doing great.
You're doing great, sweetie.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.935
Oh, good Lord.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.563
Is the cell really necessary, Simon?

24:41.563 --> 24:42.939
I came back to save Christmas.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.900
Once we do that,
maybe you and I can sit down.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.985
I can give you a few pointers
on Santa etiquette.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.447
Listen, the world doesn't need
your old-school version of Santa anymore.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.575
But people need to believe,
and the Christmas spirit is dying.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.495
How can the Christmas spirit be dying
if it's Christmas Every Day?

24:56.495 --> 24:59.039
Well, there's a thinker!

25:01.208 --> 25:03.752
- Fence! Fence, fence, fence, fence!
- Oh. All right.

25:03.752 --> 25:08.256
Butter-- Butter, let's fly! Come on!
Come on! Now! Now! Butter!

25:08.256 --> 25:10.550
Butter! I treasure you!

25:16.806 --> 25:17.849
Yes!

25:17.849 --> 25:20.727
You did it! You did it! You did it!
You did it! I knew it.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.230
Cal, uh, where's the opening?

25:23.855 --> 25:27.067
- Cal!
- Cal! Open your eyes!

25:27.067 --> 25:29.736
- Oh! Oh, man. This is happening.
- Right.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.946
- Yep.
- Okay.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.489
- You gotta go higher. Higher.
- All right.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.908
To the right. And higher. Straight.

25:34.908 --> 25:38.370
Higher. Higher! Too high. Too high!
There. There.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.705
- Guys, this is too dangerous. Turn around!
- What?

25:40.705 --> 25:43.416
I can't! It's pulling us in!
It's pulling us in!

25:47.671 --> 25:49.714
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

25:49.714 --> 25:50.799
What now?

25:50.799 --> 25:53.093
Think we're running out of time. Look.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.511
Hey, where'd you get that?

25:54.511 --> 25:56.179
No, wait, hold on. Hold on. Whoa.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.433
You know,
that orb could've gotten us out of here.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.102
I know.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.691
So, what are you in for?
