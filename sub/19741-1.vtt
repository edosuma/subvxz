00:23.083 --> 00:24.583

00:24.667 --> 00:26.458
He joked about getting it for me
as a wedding gift.

it was here.

the mother of Rhys and Margot.

They're pulling a job tonight.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.375
We'll catch them in the act,
put them away,

00:56.458 --> 00:58.041
and you will be free.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.875
You'll be charged with fraud,

07:59.125 --> 08:00.542

09:15.375 --> 09:16.875
-How long would this deal be?
-Three years.

09:16.959 --> 09:17.875
-One.
-Two.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.375
18 months,
if this job doesn't kill me first.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.000
And exactly what kind of jobs
are we talking about?

09:23.083 --> 09:25.917
Dog walker, sign twirler, hand model.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.458
Oh, but that got weird.

09:27.542 --> 09:30.166
16 jobs in the last 3 months.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.500
Did you give any of your employers
your Social Security number?

09:32.583 --> 09:34.583
You think one of them
put the money in my name?

09:34.667 --> 09:36.625
Could be. It's a place to start.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.834
Maybe that ferret guy in Studio City.

09:38.917 --> 09:39.792
Ferret guy?

09:39.875 --> 09:41.625
Oh, sorry. Ferret wrangler?

09:41.709 --> 09:43.542
Studio City?
How long have you been here?

09:43.959 --> 09:45.875
Not long. A few weeks.

09:45.959 --> 09:46.834
You didn't call me?

09:46.917 --> 09:48.291
No. I just--

09:48.375 --> 09:51.542
I wanted to get my life together,
get a real job before I called you.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.500
But there are no jobs for millennials.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.417
Sweetie, you are not a millennial.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.166
[gasps]
Don't be mean. I'm trying.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.792
It's just I'm not qualified
to do anything.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.333
Okay, what about waiting tables?

10:02.417 --> 10:03.500
Uh-uh, he punches people.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.834
One customer one time.

10:04.917 --> 10:05.917
He has a problem with authority.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.750
No! I have a problem with injustice.

10:09.875 --> 10:10.917
And it gets me into trouble.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.291
-[elevator bell dings]
-That seems to run in the family.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.458
Oh, hey, write down all your employers

10:15.542 --> 10:17.291
so we can call
and do background checks.

10:17.375 --> 10:21.375
Okay, but, you know,
maybe steer clear of the ferret guy.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.041
-[Alice] The answer's no.
-That's what Ben said.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.000
-Good.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.333
-At first.
-What?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.166
-He accepted the deal?
-Without consulting me?

10:27.250 --> 10:28.291
It's only 18 months.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.625
-No!
-Alice--

10:29.709 --> 10:31.500
We had a plan.
He was gonna do the time.

10:31.583 --> 10:32.834
He was going straight.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.959
He is. He's working for the FBI.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.083
As a criminal aiding other criminals.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.917
She doesn't care about Ben.
She's gonna get him killed.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.333
Who is this Agent Diaz?

10:41.417 --> 10:43.458
She's one of our best undercover agents.

10:43.542 --> 10:44.458
You would love her.

10:44.542 --> 10:45.834
-I hate her.
-Me too.

10:45.917 --> 10:46.917
I'm calling her.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.083
Feel free,
but Ben's already made his decision.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.458
-The deal's done.
-I'm calling him, too.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.625
He seems so sweet.

10:58.709 --> 11:00.041
He is sweet.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.834
He's sweet and fun and you love him,

11:02.917 --> 11:05.542
and then the next thing
you know, you're out 750 bucks

11:05.625 --> 11:07.000
and your favorite jacket is gone.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.041
Besides, I thought you were interested
in a different adorable man-child.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.417
I was, but he never really made his move.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.208
Things got a little crazy around here.

11:19.291 --> 11:20.500
I know. I'm teasing.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.250
Kind of.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.125
Friday night.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.125
8:00 p.m.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.542
I'm making my move.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.000
Very impressive.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.750
But put it away
before you put someone's eye out.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.041
[sighs]

11:56.166 --> 11:57.750
Meeting went well, I thought.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.291
Were we at the same meeting?

11:59.709 --> 12:00.959
Ivor shouldn't have been on his phone.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.333
I'm not talking about Ivor.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.792
I'm talking about the three leftenants
who didn't show up.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.458
All three missed payments
this month, too.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.500
Look, here's one of our opium freighters.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.792
Apparently just vanished
in the South Pacific.

12:12.875 --> 12:17.250
And a gold transport
that was seized by the Swiss authorities.

12:17.792 --> 12:18.959
These things do happen, you know.

12:19.041 --> 12:21.333
When I worked for your mother,
there were always fires to put out.

12:21.417 --> 12:25.291
Oh, do you mean like the one that
destroyed our five-star hotel in Bilbao?

12:25.375 --> 12:26.583
When did that happen?

12:26.667 --> 12:27.667
Today.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.417
It's blatant disrespect.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.417
I need to find these turncoats.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.083
Well, I can't tell you
where to find them,

12:34.166 --> 12:36.125
but I can tell you
what they all have in common.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.583
They were all me.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.166
What does that mean?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.083
All three started off
as your mother's right hand

12:42.166 --> 12:43.500
before being promoted.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.542
What are you going to do?

12:49.625 --> 12:52.792
I'm gonna do what every girl dreams
of doing at one point or another--

12:54.458 --> 12:55.834
I'm going to kill my mother.

12:58.417 --> 12:59.250
[chuckles]

13:01.709 --> 13:03.792
You couldn't have stopped Ben
from taking that deal?

13:05.792 --> 13:07.333
It was his decision.

13:08.417 --> 13:09.709
And it's not my case anymore.

13:10.834 --> 13:12.667
Because I got promoted this morning.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.000
We should celebrate.

13:15.417 --> 13:16.709
Oh, we will.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.583
The minute you come back here
with my computers

13:19.667 --> 13:21.709
and my files and my servers.

Then why are you here

so maybe he called you.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.250
No. He did not call.
You know why?

15:56.333 --> 15:59.375
Because someone with a shiv found out
that he made a deal with the feds.

16:02.250 --> 16:05.709

is gonna pay you to be a criminal?

and this time they won't miss
the major organs.

but you can call Alice.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.750
You didn't need to take it.
It was yours.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.792
Is that why you torched
the hotel in Bilbao?

18:37.875 --> 18:39.875
To teach me that valuable lesson?

18:40.959 --> 18:41.792
What do you mean?

18:41.875 --> 18:43.208
It burned to the ground.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.792
You burned it to the ground.

18:50.875 --> 18:54.333
That hotel was our insurance policy.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.041
Well, that's where you're wrong
because there is no payout for arson.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.542
Your father stashed millions there--

18:59.625 --> 19:03.166
in the walls, in the floor,
in cash, in gold--

19:03.250 --> 19:04.750
just in case.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.125
No one knew.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.291
Your father only told me
because he knew he was dying.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.709
Well, if you didn't do this,
then who did?

19:15.291 --> 19:16.875
Who else would Dad have told?

19:16.959 --> 19:20.208
Well, you find out,
because I can't do anything from in here.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.000
It's up to you now, darling.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.333
It's all up to you.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.000
[Danny] Tommy, get in here.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.125
We found the overseas bank
account with your name on it.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.250
Wow.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.792
So, now we just need
to get through the security questions

19:33.875 --> 19:34.750
and we're in.

19:34.834 --> 19:35.917
What was the name of your first pet?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.333
We used to have
the sweetest little pit bull

19:38.417 --> 19:40.542
-named Gracie.
-Aww. Gracie.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.250
-Alice named her.
-That's so sweet.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.834
I love pit bulls.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.542
Me too.
They're the best dogs in the world.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.291
Except for the ones
that bite people's faces off.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.458
Next question--
Favorite musician.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.250
Uh, Kate Bush.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.208
Love Kate Bush.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.375
What's your favorite album?

19:53.458 --> 19:55.709
I mean, I'll always love
"The Dreaming,"

19:55.792 --> 19:57.166
-but "Hounds of Love" is so amazing!
-"Hounds of Love"!

19:57.250 --> 19:59.959
Oh, for God's sake.
What street did you grow up on?

20:00.959 --> 20:02.417
Uh, Wallace Road.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.375
Stop it!

20:03.458 --> 20:04.667
You did not.
In Tucson?

20:04.750 --> 20:05.750
No, in Mumbai.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.000
-What?
-You grew up in India?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.083
You grew up in India?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.792
I used to live in Mumbai.

20:10.875 --> 20:11.834
-You did not.
-I did.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.000
You did not.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.792
You were detained there under
suspicion of drug trafficking.

20:17.000 --> 20:17.917
Next question.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.500
So, what's the job?

20:20.583 --> 20:23.208
It's not even a job.
It's more of an errand, really.

20:23.291 --> 20:26.041
A little light safecracking.
It's right up your street.

20:26.125 --> 20:26.959
Who's the client?

20:27.041 --> 20:28.583
We don't even have to deal
with the client.

20:28.667 --> 20:29.792
He's sending his boys over right now.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.542
And you won't tell me
his name because...

20:33.083 --> 20:34.250
It's Carl Mangels.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.458
Are you insane?

20:35.542 --> 20:37.125
No. No way.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.792
Mangels is actually very misunderstood.

20:38.875 --> 20:42.625
He only "mangles" people
who break promises to him.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.583
[knock on door]

20:43.667 --> 20:44.500
Oh, man.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.375
Nothing worse than early gangsters.

20:47.041 --> 20:47.875
Rhys.

20:47.959 --> 20:49.375
[whispering]
I can't not let them in.

20:49.458 --> 20:50.500
I am not working for Mangels.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.875
You wouldn't be doing it
for Mangels.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.458
-You would be doing it for Alice.
-What does that mean?

20:53.542 --> 20:54.750
[knocking continues]

20:54.834 --> 20:56.125
They know you have a girlfriend.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.083
And how do they know that?

20:57.166 --> 20:58.291
I didn't know it was a secret.

20:58.667 --> 21:02.333
For her sake and for our sake,
please just do this one job.

21:02.417 --> 21:05.041
Man, you used to love safecracking.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.333
[knocking continues]

21:07.750 --> 21:09.583
Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.

21:10.125 --> 21:12.333
Ben, you know Thaddeus and Jeremy.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.875
Come on in, fellas.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.000
Let's get to work.

21:24.542 --> 21:25.417
Sheets, towels.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.458
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.

21:28.542 --> 21:29.667
Anything else?

21:29.750 --> 21:33.583
Well, now that you mention it,
uh... I'm a little thirsty.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.458
Forgive me.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.875
Go easy in case we have
more questions for you tomorrow.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.834
Wait, wait.
Wh-Where are you going?

21:44.917 --> 21:45.750
Back to work.

21:45.834 --> 21:47.208
Well, to work on my case?

21:47.291 --> 21:48.917
'Cause I'm officially
giving you the night off.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.250
It's not about your case.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.041
But you're not gonna tell me
about it because--?

21:54.125 --> 21:55.625
Because it's work, it's boring.

21:55.709 --> 21:58.000
And because I'm your idiot brother
who can barely hold a job--

21:58.083 --> 21:59.250
No, that is not it at all.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.375
It's fine, it's fine.

22:00.917 --> 22:01.792
Yeah, I just...

22:04.542 --> 22:06.166
I thought I was gonna be different
this time.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.250
You know, I was coming
to you with money.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.083
I was gonna buy you bourbon.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.000
And we'd hang out like we used to do.

22:12.667 --> 22:13.750
[grunts]

22:14.542 --> 22:17.083
Back when we were both problem children.

22:22.959 --> 22:24.500
I was never a problem child.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.291
-[cork pops]
-Yet you were the one

22:27.375 --> 22:28.959
who taught me how to drink this stuff.

22:29.041 --> 22:29.917
[glass slides]

22:31.041 --> 22:33.041
But if you have to go back
to your office, then...

22:36.083 --> 22:37.083
...I understand.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.041
[Tommy] You're engaged to a con man?

22:41.375 --> 22:42.250
[Alice] Mm-hmm.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.250
Con man who was stabbed last night,

22:44.917 --> 22:46.750
kidnapped from federal prison,

22:46.875 --> 22:49.208
and hasn't called me since this morning,

22:49.291 --> 22:50.500
so he may be dead.

22:50.834 --> 22:51.750
I have no idea.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.041
Why don't you just call him?

22:53.125 --> 22:55.583
I can't, not with the FBI watching me.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.667
The F--?

22:57.834 --> 22:58.750
Wow.

22:58.834 --> 23:00.083
I know.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.917
I guess it makes sense, given Dad.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.375
Ben is nothing like Dad.

23:07.458 --> 23:09.625
[laughs]
He's not a charming con man?

23:10.291 --> 23:11.208
Dad's not a con man.

23:11.291 --> 23:13.000
Okay, you're right.
Yeah.

23:13.083 --> 23:17.750
Dad is strictly an--
an amateur cheat and thief and liar.

23:17.834 --> 23:19.500
I do not have a daddy thing.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.667
What?
Then, of course, there's Ethan.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.375
Ethan was a mistake.

23:31.041 --> 23:32.166
You were gonna marry him.

23:32.250 --> 23:34.625
No, he was gonna marry me
whether I wanted to or not.

23:38.875 --> 23:39.917
Do you ever...

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
ever hear from him?

23:45.583 --> 23:47.792
No, he knows better than that.
Do you?

23:48.959 --> 23:50.125
Not very often.

23:52.041 --> 23:53.375
He was always good to me.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.333
That makes one of us.

23:58.667 --> 24:00.709
-But now you're with Christopher.
-Ben.

24:00.792 --> 24:03.041
-Ah, sorry. Ben.
-[alice chuckles]

24:03.125 --> 24:04.000
[tommy chuckles]

24:04.834 --> 24:06.583
What? What?

24:06.667 --> 24:10.000
It's just, for the first time in our lives

24:10.125 --> 24:14.750
I think that your life sucks
way worse than mine.

24:14.834 --> 24:16.166
Yeah, I think you may be right.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.583
I'm not gonna lie,
it feels pretty good.

24:17.667 --> 24:18.709
[both chuckle]

24:24.959 --> 24:26.041
[footsteps approach]

24:26.625 --> 24:29.667
The mark is Galinda Mangels.

24:30.083 --> 24:31.333
Mangels is targeting his wife?

24:31.417 --> 24:33.041
Mangels is divorcing his wife.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.750
You said this was gonna be
a simple snatch-and-grab.

24:34.834 --> 24:36.250
It is going to be simple.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.000
We just have to get to that part.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.709
Which means getting to Galinda.

24:39.792 --> 24:40.834
Since the separation,

24:40.917 --> 24:43.375
Galinda has gone
after all of Mangels' assets,

24:43.458 --> 24:45.875
which is why there is
an armed body man with her at all times.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.333
What does Mangels want us to grab?

24:47.417 --> 24:49.041
A titanium briefcase.

24:49.125 --> 24:50.375
He didn't tell me what was inside,

24:50.458 --> 24:51.959
but I'm guessing it's leverage

24:52.041 --> 24:53.125
she can use against him
in the divorce.

24:53.208 --> 24:54.667
Where's the briefcase now?

24:55.458 --> 24:58.125
Mangels' former Beverly Hills estate,

24:58.208 --> 25:00.083
which Galinda intends to keep.

25:00.166 --> 25:04.166
There are wireless alarm sensors
outfitted to every point of entry.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.709
There are also cameras.
Loads of them.

25:06.792 --> 25:09.250
According to Mangels,
just off the living room

25:09.333 --> 25:13.000
is a hidden custom-made
U.L. class 350 safe

25:13.083 --> 25:15.166
where our prize awaits.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.125
With all that security,
we can't risk breaking in.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.834
-We'll need a cover.
-We do have a cover.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.375
Well... you do.

25:20.458 --> 25:21.834
The only people
with access to the house

25:21.917 --> 25:26.208
are the housekeeper
and Galinda's massage therapists.

25:26.291 --> 25:30.959
Meet Brian, Eric, and... wait for it...
Thor.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.000
She hires them from a company

25:35.083 --> 25:39.041
that guarantees a deep,
all-over massage "experience."

25:39.125 --> 25:40.083
Rhys, I'm not doing it.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.250
Look at it this way--

25:41.333 --> 25:43.542
she gets her happy ending, we get ours.

25:47.709 --> 25:50.583
Okay, next employer on the list
is the Kincaids.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.125
What did you do for them?

25:52.208 --> 25:54.125
Uh, I was a dog walker.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.166
Two little pugs twice a day.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.834
Oh, that sounds so fun.
I want a dog.

25:58.917 --> 26:00.041
Well, you should get one.

26:00.125 --> 26:03.583
I'd just feel terrible leaving him
alone all day-- or her.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.625
So, you don't have
a-a roommate or boyfriend?

26:05.709 --> 26:07.417
Not even a plant.
It's just me.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.458
Is that sad?
I'm not sad?

26:09.542 --> 26:10.750
No, no, it's good.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.458
I just thought you and-- and Danny were--

26:14.709 --> 26:15.625
Uh, no.

26:16.709 --> 26:17.667
We're not--

26:17.750 --> 26:20.000
Uh... it's complicated.

26:20.083 --> 26:20.959
Gotcha.

26:21.959 --> 26:22.834
Good to know.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.583
So, the Kincaids?

26:25.667 --> 26:27.417
[Danny] Sophie and Tommy figured out

26:27.500 --> 26:29.750
that the overseas account
was opened in Tommy's name

26:29.834 --> 26:33.375
by his former employers,
Jimmy and Cathy Kincaid.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.250
Both schoolteachers in Pasadena.

26:35.333 --> 26:36.875
Great.
What did you do for them?

26:37.500 --> 26:38.792
I used to walk their dogs.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.667
-How'd they find you?
-Uh, Craigslist, I think.

26:40.750 --> 26:41.959
And how'd they pay you?

26:42.041 --> 26:44.000
Cash usually, sometimes a check.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.333
They could've gotten your Social
once their checks cleared.

26:46.417 --> 26:47.583
What else about the Kincaids?

26:47.667 --> 26:49.250
Were they well-off, well-connected?

26:49.333 --> 26:50.792
People coming in and out of the house?

26:50.875 --> 26:52.041
They weren't well-off.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.375
Aside from the $3 million
they left in Tommy's account,

26:54.458 --> 26:57.667
their combined bank accounts
come to $226,

26:57.750 --> 26:59.875
and their credit cards
haven't been used in two days.

26:59.959 --> 27:01.959
Oh, and both their phones
are disconnected.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.875
Looks like we're going to Pasadena.

27:08.375 --> 27:09.208
Hello?

27:09.583 --> 27:10.792
Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid?

27:18.750 --> 27:20.291
Some of this mail's over a week old.

27:20.375 --> 27:22.000
[dogs bark, whine]

27:22.417 --> 27:23.667
Oh, hi!

27:23.750 --> 27:25.083
Hey, kids.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.917
Where's Mom and Dad, huh?

27:29.041 --> 27:30.083
Danny.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.709
[dog whining]

27:51.709 --> 27:53.291
The Kincaids are dead?

27:54.959 --> 27:55.792
I don't...

27:57.709 --> 27:58.959
...understand.

28:01.709 --> 28:03.750
Does this mean
that I can keep the money?

28:03.834 --> 28:04.667
-What?
-Tommy.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.500
Well... the Kincaids--

28:07.583 --> 28:09.041
they don't need it anymore, right?

28:09.125 --> 28:10.625
Because they're dead.

28:10.709 --> 28:12.875
-Not dead-- murdered.
-Uh-huh.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.125
Probably for the money.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.875

-Thank you.
-I, uh--

37:30.333 --> 37:34.625
I didn't want to leave
without returning this, finally.

37:35.959 --> 37:37.542
Don't be an idiot.
You should stay.

37:44.375 --> 37:46.083
I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that, please?

37:46.166 --> 37:47.458
I couldn't hear you.

37:47.542 --> 37:52.542
I can't take that money because
you changed the password.

37:52.625 --> 37:55.208
Mm-hmm.
But you know what you can do?

37:55.291 --> 37:58.083
You can stay and help us
find out whose money that is,

37:58.166 --> 38:01.000
and at the end of the day,
if it's free and clear, it's yours.

38:01.083 --> 38:02.333
And how are you gonna do that?

38:02.417 --> 38:04.291
Well, now that we have our files back...

-Hmm?

38:09.625 --> 38:10.750
We can get back to work.

You owe me a dinner.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.166
Yep.

38:35.709 --> 38:36.959
Didn't I promise you?

38:37.041 --> 38:38.083
Yes, you did.

38:38.583 --> 38:39.875
And I promised you...

38:41.208 --> 38:42.458
that we would celebrate.

38:44.208 --> 38:46.083
Look, I'm not sure
I want to anymore.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.375
Turns out my promotion
comes with a transfer

38:51.125 --> 38:52.333
to Washington, D.C.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.458
So this is how you want to do it?

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
The minute I start to show
a little interest,

38:58.583 --> 39:00.083
you play hard to get.

39:02.375 --> 39:03.333
Look.

39:04.208 --> 39:06.417
We could always do
the long-distance thing.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.959
Because that always works.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.834
Or... walk away before we get hurt.

39:14.125 --> 39:15.000
Or...

39:16.458 --> 39:17.667
we could celebrate.

Well, you'll have to come over
to my place.

That's a good point.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.291
He'd want to have a three-way.

You can't come over.

39:55.417 --> 39:57.375
I guess we can sneak around.

39:57.458 --> 40:00.041
Ah, sneaking around,

40:00.125 --> 40:01.250
