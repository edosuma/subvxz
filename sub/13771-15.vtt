00:02.828 --> 00:04.221
There's a head of rotten
lettuce in the fridge.

00:04.308 --> 00:05.788
Not strong enough.

00:06.789 --> 00:07.877
Why don't you dig out
whatever it was

00:07.964 --> 00:08.921
that died under the furnace?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.488
Still not strong enough!

00:11.533 --> 00:13.622
What about the old boot
that possum gave birth in?

00:13.709 --> 00:14.710
It's out in the garage.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.581
Perfect!

00:16.668 --> 00:19.628

01:01.322 --> 01:02.845
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:02.932 --> 01:03.889
My alarm clock
didn't go off

01:03.976 --> 01:05.282
and then there was an accident

01:05.369 --> 01:06.414
and road workers and...

01:08.372 --> 01:09.591
Where is everybody?

01:09.678 --> 01:10.766
Well, it's Ditch Day.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.115
None of the students
came in.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.377
No one told me
there was a ditch day.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.945
Wow, I'm surprised
you didn't hear.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.382
I mean, everyone was
telling their friends.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.646
Oh...

01:22.647 --> 01:24.301
All right, Cherise,

01:24.388 --> 01:27.043
the professor of booze-ology
has some homework for you.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.523
[door shuts]

01:28.610 --> 01:29.785
What's he doing here?

01:29.872 --> 01:31.221
No one told him.

01:32.222 --> 01:35.269
Oh, my God.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.574
You could probably use
a little...

01:36.661 --> 01:38.228
Val, stop that.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.057
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:41.144 --> 01:43.146
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:43.233 --> 01:45.192
-What?
-You are going to die!

01:45.279 --> 01:46.932
-What is it?
-I know I always say

01:47.019 --> 01:48.369
that gossip rots your soul,

01:48.456 --> 01:50.284
but it doesn't count
when it's this good.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.546
Last night,
I covered for Bernice

01:51.633 --> 01:53.156
so she could leave early,

01:53.243 --> 01:54.810
and when she got home,
she found Charlie standing

01:54.897 --> 01:58.030
in their living room
wearing her red cocktail dress!

01:58.118 --> 02:01.208
The one from the Christmas
party with all the feathers!

02:01.295 --> 02:02.687
Good God!

02:02.774 --> 02:04.559
He admitted it's been
going on for years.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.343
He said it started
one day

02:06.430 --> 02:08.389
when he accidentally used
lipstick instead of ChapStick.

02:08.476 --> 02:09.824
The next thing you knew,

02:09.912 --> 02:11.218
he was wearing a teddy
under his police uniform.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.959
Man is a complicated beast.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.570
Can you imagine

02:15.657 --> 02:17.137
keeping something like that
from your spouse?

02:19.443 --> 02:21.097
So glad we don't have
any secrets.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.970
-[both giggling]
-Oh ho ho!

02:26.494 --> 02:27.625
[laughing]

02:27.712 --> 02:29.758
-Whoo!
-Ooh.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.499
LOIS: Whoo hoo!

02:31.586 --> 02:32.978
[giggling]

02:34.545 --> 02:36.678
Whoo-oo...

02:38.723 --> 02:41.944
[snoring]

03:06.621 --> 03:08.362
Ohh...

03:17.284 --> 03:19.111
What is it?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.114
Oh, honey, there's something
I should confess to you.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.420
What?!

03:23.507 --> 03:26.858
I...

03:33.430 --> 03:36.172
I spent more than $50
on your last birthday present.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.565
I know we agreed
not to,

03:37.652 --> 03:40.132
but I just love you so much.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.572
Well, I'm glad
you told me.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.051
Felt good to come clean.
[chuckles]

03:47.966 --> 03:49.577
[breathing loudly]

03:50.752 --> 03:53.798
Dad, can I have
a sleepover tomorrow?

03:53.885 --> 03:56.105
Somebody wants
to sleep over? Here?

03:56.192 --> 03:57.106
That's fantastic!

03:57.193 --> 03:58.325
Who?

03:58.412 --> 03:59.326
Chad from my class.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.631
Oh, geez, Dewey,

04:00.718 --> 04:01.502
I don't think
that's a good idea.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.720
That kid is really...

04:02.807 --> 04:03.721
He's fine.

04:03.808 --> 04:04.940
He's just
a little strange.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.855
Nothing to be scared of.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.857
Well, it's not anything
to be taken lightly, either.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.207
That boy has a lot
of serious issues.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.600
I don't think you know
what you're getting into.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.384
Yes, I do.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.908
I also know people treat him
like a freak for no reason.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.867
Even his parents
have given up on him.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.476
They're just looking
for an excuse

04:20.564 --> 04:22.218
to have him
institutionalized.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.394
This is supposed
to be convincing me?

04:24.481 --> 04:26.266
Dad, I want to prove
that he can do normal stuff

04:26.353 --> 04:28.093
like a normal kid
and have a normal life.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.443
No means no, Dewey.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.922
No doesn't
always mean no.

04:31.009 --> 04:34.186
This isn't "PG-movie" no,
this is "spear gun" no.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.581
Dad, listen.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.930
I never ask for anything,

04:39.017 --> 04:40.845
but I'm asking you
to do this for me.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.847
It's important.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.327
I'm sorry, Dewey,

04:44.414 --> 04:46.286
but I know a little
bit more about this

04:46.373 --> 04:47.635
than you do.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.637
And you ask for things
all the time.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.293
So where'd you go today?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.903
Oh, man,
it was fantastic.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.557
Went down
to the pet store,

04:56.644 --> 04:58.428
fed a bunch of the pets
to the other pets,

04:58.515 --> 04:59.777
ended up at the supermarket,

04:59.864 --> 05:01.083
where I squeezed
all the Wonder Bread

05:01.170 --> 05:03.433
into balls till
the manager threw me out.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.783
I left a little present
in his convertible.

05:05.870 --> 05:08.046
Well, it was somebody's
convertible.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.179
You couldn't have bothered
to tell me about Ditch Day?

05:10.266 --> 05:11.702
There was a ditch day?!

05:11.789 --> 05:12.921
Yeah, today.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.706
No one told me.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.012
Why didn't they tell me?

05:17.099 --> 05:18.230
Because no one likes us, Reese.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.493
No one.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.146
Everybody else
was told about it.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.540
Even that slow kid who
ate cat litter for a dollar.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.934
Gucky? How did Gucky
get so popular?

05:26.021 --> 05:29.590
It's not that he's popular,
it's that we're unpopular.

05:29.677 --> 05:33.071
Oh, my God.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.422
I'm as unpopular as you.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.643
Guess who's getting a treat?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.906
That's right,
it's you, Mr. Boy.

05:41.993 --> 05:42.907
-[cooing]
-In this house,

05:42.994 --> 05:44.126
whenever anybody is good

05:44.213 --> 05:45.823
for three whole days in a row,

05:45.910 --> 05:49.131
they get one of Mama's
extra special fruit smoothies.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.699
I have never made one before.

05:52.961 --> 05:53.962
Hmm.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.403
Oh, this is outrageous!

06:00.490 --> 06:01.709
What's the matter?

06:01.796 --> 06:03.145
The blender is broken.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.190
There's no excuse for this!

06:05.277 --> 06:07.932
Honey, we have had it
since before Dewey was born.

06:08.019 --> 06:11.196
I don't care.
They said a lifetime guarantee.

06:11.283 --> 06:14.069
A lifetime is not
10 or 11 years.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.679
Hal, if they want to say

06:15.766 --> 06:17.333
a 10 or 11-year guarantee,
that's fine.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.509
I'll make my blender-buying
decisions accordingly,

06:19.596 --> 06:21.119
but they said "lifetime."

06:21.206 --> 06:22.556
I'm getting my money back

06:22.643 --> 06:23.644
or a blender of equal
or greater value.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.080
Well, how are you going

06:25.167 --> 06:26.864
to find the warranty
from ten years ago?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.300
I'm sure it's with the rest
of the papers in the garage.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.085
Oh, honey, you'll never
find it out there.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.087
What did this cost, $19?

06:32.174 --> 06:33.610
That's what they want
you to say!

06:33.697 --> 06:35.351
That's why they
don't charge more!

06:35.438 --> 06:37.527
-That's how they get you!
-Ohh.

06:37.614 --> 06:38.746
-[doorbell rings]
-[sighs]

06:38.833 --> 06:40.008
You expecting somebody?

06:40.095 --> 06:41.183
Uh, yeah, it's Chad.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.402
He's sleeping
over tonight.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.013
Dewey's having a sleepover?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.231
Yeah, we didn't
have any plans.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.407
I thought it would be nice.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.018
Dewey, your friend's here!

06:51.628 --> 06:53.064
Hold on.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.805
I told you "no,"

06:54.892 --> 06:56.764
and you went behind my back
and tricked your mother

06:56.851 --> 06:58.809
into letting you have
this sleepover?

06:58.896 --> 07:00.594
I just told her
it'd be a nice thing to do

07:00.681 --> 07:03.466
for a kid who doesn't have
many nice things in his life.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.599
If you call that a trick,
then yeah.

07:06.817 --> 07:07.818
You don't have
to freak out.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.211
I know how to handle Chad.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.778
You can't believe
everything you read

07:10.865 --> 07:12.519
in the special needs bulletin.

07:12.606 --> 07:13.911
They only say that stuff
to get extra funding.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.391
That is not the point!

07:15.478 --> 07:16.653
Dewey, I made
myself very clear.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.133
I told you "no,"

07:18.220 --> 07:19.439
and you snuck around
my back to your mother

07:19.526 --> 07:20.831
as if nothing I said
had any imp--

07:20.918 --> 07:22.354
Hello, there!

07:22.442 --> 07:24.313
You must be Chad's parents.
[laughing]

07:24.400 --> 07:25.749
-Yes. I'm Lloyd.
-Lloyd.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.664
-And this is Evelyn.
-Evelyn.

07:27.751 --> 07:28.752
And this...

07:28.839 --> 07:30.406
God, where did he go?!

07:30.493 --> 07:31.842
I watched him
from the car to the door.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.322
Do I have to do everything?!

07:33.409 --> 07:34.628
[footsteps]

07:34.715 --> 07:35.759
-Excuse me.
-[sighing]

07:35.846 --> 07:37.457
Thank you for inviting me.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.806
-Hi, Chad.
-Hey, Dewey.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.681
We want to thank you
for doing this.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.596
I think it's wonderful
the boys are getting together.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.077
Big books go
on the bottom shelf.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.687
What did we tell you
about touching their things?!

07:50.774 --> 07:51.993
LLOYD: Are you
trying to prove

07:52.080 --> 07:53.777
that you can't go out
in public?!

07:53.864 --> 07:55.605
This is your last chance,
do you understand me, buddy?!

07:55.692 --> 07:57.172
This is your last chance!

07:57.259 --> 07:59.000
Lloyd, do something!

07:59.087 --> 08:00.610
You do something!
The gene was on your egg.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.917
Oh, yeah,
it's completely my fault.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.788
-Now can we go to dinner?
-[sighs]

08:04.875 --> 08:08.357
At bedtime, these straps
are for his arms,

08:08.444 --> 08:10.664
and these are for his legs.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.187
If you wind up
needing to use the harness,

08:12.274 --> 08:13.536
make sure he doesn't
take a big breath in

08:13.623 --> 08:15.407
when you're fastening
the buckles,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.018
otherwise, he can wriggle out
and the whole thing is useless.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.323
Completely useless.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.456
Say good-bye
to your parents, Chad.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.153
Good-bye.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.504
Here's a list
of emergency numbers.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.681
Don't try 911.
They're not qualified.

08:34.034 --> 08:36.777
Maybe they meant
to tell us.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.299
They just forgot.

08:38.386 --> 08:39.866
They didn't forget.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.652
How could the whole school
snub us like this?

08:42.739 --> 08:44.480
Don't they realize
how much this hurts?

08:44.567 --> 08:45.525
They don't care.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.439
There are people
in this world

08:47.527 --> 08:49.093
that are just plain evil.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.791
And every single person
at that school

08:50.878 --> 08:52.009
is one of those people.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.011
No, we can't do this.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.709
We can't keep blaming
everybody else

08:55.796 --> 08:57.754
whenever something
like this happens.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.190
It can't be an accident

08:59.277 --> 09:00.757
that you and I alienate
so many people.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.585
We're never going
to make our lives better

09:02.672 --> 09:04.674
if we keep pretending
they are the problem.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.461
Then what do we do?

09:09.549 --> 09:13.422
Well, I mean, if we really
want to figure this out,

09:13.509 --> 09:17.034
maybe we need to look
at ourselves honestly.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.646
You're right.

09:19.733 --> 09:20.864
What's wrong with us?

09:20.951 --> 09:22.170
Well, some parts are easy.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.346
I mean, you're
a ruthlessly brutal thug.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.130
I have my moods.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.220
And look how it was my first
impulse to criticize you.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.222
It just shows
what a pompous ass I am.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.398
I do seem to cause
a lot of needless suffering.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.444
I usually assume that
people are my enemy.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.054
I have this need
to show off.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.882
It's not enough that I know
more than everyone.

09:38.969 --> 09:41.145
I have to make sure
they know I know more.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.582
Why do I do that?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.322
Don't ask me.
I know less than everyone.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.976
When I walk into a room,

09:46.063 --> 09:47.021
it seems like everybody's
talking about things

09:47.108 --> 09:48.718
that I could never understand.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.241
And when they laugh,

09:50.328 --> 09:51.982
I'm always sure
that they're laughing at me.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.768
Maybe we're both afraid.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.467
We're afraid
people won't like us.

09:58.554 --> 09:59.729
That's why I show off
how smart I am

09:59.816 --> 10:00.948
and that's why you hit people.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.778
We're scared of being rejected,

10:04.865 --> 10:06.518
so we act in a way
that pushes people away.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.519
Oh, man.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.782
It's the thing

10:08.869 --> 10:10.392
that we hate the most,

10:10.479 --> 10:11.698
and yet we keep making
it happen again and again.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.483
We're so stupid
and pathetic.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.096
Or they're jealous!

10:19.183 --> 10:21.316
Yeah, totally jealous.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.013
I mean, they see us,

10:23.100 --> 10:24.493
and they don't want to face
that they're all jealous

10:24.580 --> 10:27.017
so they make us act
all angry and superior!

10:27.104 --> 10:28.671
They're in denial.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.325
I am really glad
we did this.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.730
Rough can't go next to smooth.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.297
This is exactly
what I talked about, Dewey.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.865
He's gone through practically
everything in the house.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.737
He taped my ties
to my shirts.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.042
So the house
gets straightened up.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.304
Wouldn't that
be horrible?

10:53.391 --> 10:54.566
Don't you trivialize this.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.133
You're in enough
trouble already.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.831
I'm telling you,
once he settles down,

10:57.918 --> 11:00.355
this is going to be
a perfectly normal sleepover.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.183
We're going to play
a board game,

11:02.270 --> 11:04.489
we're going to watch a video,
we're going to have pizza...

11:04.576 --> 11:06.491
No pizza. I'm already
defrosting hamburgers.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.276
But I promised Chad pizza.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.581
He really likes pizza.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.409
No pizza, Dewey.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.063
You are on thin ice as it is.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.326
From now on, you are going
to do exactly as I say.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.676
Is that understood?

11:16.763 --> 11:17.807
Yes, Dad, I got it.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.635
Now can I go play
with my friend?

11:22.246 --> 11:23.726
-[sighs]
-Where'd he go?

11:25.162 --> 11:26.947
You'll see a lot of this
in life, Jamie.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.513
The big blender
company's don't think

11:28.600 --> 11:29.993
we're smart enough
to save warranties.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.865
They think we run around
barefoot all day

11:31.952 --> 11:33.301
picking bugs off ourselves.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.217
Well, they are in
for a big surprise.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.047
They design their products
specifically to break down

11:40.134 --> 11:42.049
three days after
the warranties get lost.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.746
It's called
"planned obsolescence,"

11:43.833 --> 11:45.400
like that deathtrap
of a highchair

11:45.487 --> 11:46.749
you keep falling over in.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.144
I'm their worst
nightmare, Jamie;

11:50.231 --> 11:51.754
a woman who saves everything.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.409
And I'm going to go through
every shred of it.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.590
LOIS:
What's that,

12:01.677 --> 12:02.939
Mr. Big-Blender-Company man?

12:03.026 --> 12:04.506
You say I'm going
to need paperwork?

12:04.593 --> 12:07.030
Oh, gee, I don't
know if I have it.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.858
Oh, wait, I do.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.338
[laughing]

12:20.609 --> 12:23.786
Dewey, I told you to keep
Chad away from my desk!

12:23.873 --> 12:26.267
I just heard a whole bunch
of kids from our school

12:26.354 --> 12:27.790
are going to stay overnight

12:27.877 --> 12:29.531
at that old abandoned
house on Spires Road.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.489
No one told me.

12:31.576 --> 12:32.708
Big shock.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.101
I say we go there tonight

12:34.188 --> 12:35.711
and scare the crap
out of them.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.061
We're going to scare them
for being jealous of us?

12:38.148 --> 12:40.324
No, we're going to scare them
for being jerks.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.198
All right, yeah. Let's do it.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.939
They think they can
be jerks to us?

12:46.026 --> 12:47.767
We'll show them
what jerks are. [chuckles]

13:03.695 --> 13:04.784
-[hissing]
-[yelps]

13:10.920 --> 13:13.488
[doorbell rings]

13:14.619 --> 13:16.926
Hi. I got a half cheese,
half pepperoni.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.015
What? That little...

13:19.102 --> 13:21.191
Listen, I'm kind
of in a hurry. It's $12.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.932
Just hold on
a second. Dewey!

13:23.019 --> 13:25.239
[screams]: You get your butt
in here right now, Mister!

13:25.326 --> 13:26.936
Dad, what is wrong with you?

13:27.023 --> 13:29.939
You can't go screaming
in the house when Chad's here.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.593
I am the parent
in this house,

13:31.680 --> 13:33.334
and you do what I say!

13:33.421 --> 13:35.249
Now when I tell you there
is no pizza in this house,

13:35.336 --> 13:36.250
there's no pizza!

13:36.337 --> 13:37.468
That is the law!

13:37.555 --> 13:39.079
-Dad...
-Don't you "Dad" me.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.255
You already "Dad-ed" me good
with this sleepover.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.387
You know what? Sometimes
if you're just being

13:43.474 --> 13:46.651
bigoted and unreasonable, maybe
I don't have to listen to you.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.131
You better listen to me.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.046
I am your father
and you will respect...

13:50.133 --> 13:51.352
Hey, you know what?

13:51.439 --> 13:53.615
This was supposed to go
to 12336.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.054
I bet you feel
like a jackass.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.585
-[door shuts]
-I have something to tell you.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.892
Hal, it'll have to wait.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.242
I wasted a half an hour
getting Jamie to sleep.

14:12.329 --> 14:13.809
He kept crying because
I wouldn't let him

14:13.896 --> 14:16.203
have the antifreeze bottle
in bed with him.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.552
Lois, this is important.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.162
I was trying to spare you
the embarrassment,

14:19.249 --> 14:20.729
but you should probably know.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.035
Dewey actually

14:22.122 --> 14:23.558
asked me first about
the sleepover.

14:23.645 --> 14:24.776
And he went to you

14:24.864 --> 14:26.474
when I said "no."

14:26.561 --> 14:28.563
Oh, sorry.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.912
What do you mean, "sorry"?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.609
Maybe you don't
understand.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.177
He went around my back
to get to you.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.657
And this is a big
upset for you?

14:35.744 --> 14:37.659
For God's sake, Hal,
they go behind my back

14:37.746 --> 14:39.182
to get to you all the time.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.575
That is very different.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.011
You are the hard ass.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.708
I'm the nice, fair one.

14:43.795 --> 14:44.666
And Dewey knows that.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.102
Why would he betray me?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
Hal, I cannot
get worked up about this

14:47.930 --> 14:49.627
right now!

14:49.714 --> 14:52.717
I have to find that warranty
or the blender company wins.

14:52.804 --> 14:53.849
Is that what you want, Hal?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.155
Are you on their side?

14:55.242 --> 14:56.983
-Fine. I'll help you.
-[sighs]

15:01.944 --> 15:02.858
No, Hal.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.599
I have a system.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.470
Anyway, it seems
to be going fine.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.472
I haven't heard a peep
out of them in hours.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.519
[banging]

15:11.606 --> 15:13.390
Hey, Chad, I can teach you
to play Chinese checkers

15:13.477 --> 15:14.391
if you want.

15:15.784 --> 15:16.872
Chad!

15:16.959 --> 15:17.960
White on white.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.310
Blue on blue.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.052
And yellow on yellow.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.488
Chad, don't do this!

15:24.575 --> 15:26.795
If someone catches you,
you'll be in big troub--

15:30.494 --> 15:32.496
-[banging continues]
-HAL: Dewey.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.976
Just a minute.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.937
-[phone ringing]
-[sighs]

15:43.594 --> 15:44.900
Hello.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.597
Oh, hello, Lloyd.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.252
No, everything's going
fine with Chad.

15:49.339 --> 15:52.429
Well, you can bring it
if you think he needs it.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.518
[creaking]

15:54.605 --> 15:56.477
We are going to scare
the crap out of them.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.522
You know what?
I don't feel sorry for them.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.915
They've got it coming.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.004
They deserve every
stained pair of underwear

16:02.091 --> 16:03.353
they're about to get.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.355
Hey, is my eye socket
oozing enough?

16:05.442 --> 16:07.662
-It's perfect.
-Okay.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.968
On the count of three,
we bust through the door.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.491
If one of them has
a heart attack,

16:10.578 --> 16:12.754
you resuscitate them
and I'll scare them again.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.104
Ready?

16:15.191 --> 16:18.629
One... two... three.

16:18.716 --> 16:21.981
[yelling]

16:27.029 --> 16:28.683
What are you
guys doing?

16:28.770 --> 16:31.686
-Um...
-Um...

16:31.773 --> 16:33.253
-Uh...
-Um...

16:33.340 --> 16:34.994
-Nothing.
-[chuckles softly]

16:35.081 --> 16:36.996
You guys trying
to scare us?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.172
What, are you 12?

16:39.259 --> 16:40.782
We weren't trying
to scare you.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.523
[scoffs]
Of course not.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.004
That's the opposite of what
we were trying to do.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.309
We're meeting girls here.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.878
The why are you
dressed like that?

16:49.965 --> 16:52.272
Because...

16:54.274 --> 16:55.536
Um...

17:00.802 --> 17:02.195
Uh...

17:04.848 --> 17:07.026
Why don't you like us?!

17:08.810 --> 17:11.377
I got to say, they had
some pretty solid reasons.

17:13.118 --> 17:14.468
-Come on, Chad.
-[banging]

17:14.555 --> 17:16.383
You have to find some way
to snap out of this.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.603
Look, I went to bat for you.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.344
I've been protecting
you all day,

17:21.431 --> 17:22.954
but this is something
I can't cover up.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.478
And if your
parents find out,

17:24.565 --> 17:26.393
they're going to put you away.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.395
Are you listening?

17:28.482 --> 17:31.093
Yes.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.617
Green goes with green, goes
with green, goes with green,

17:33.704 --> 17:35.141
-goes with green,
-[doorbell rings]

17:35.228 --> 17:36.403
goes with green,
goes with green...

17:37.491 --> 17:38.840
Hello, Hal.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.277
Evelyn, Lloyd,
come on in.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.627
So, we were halfway through
our first dinner alone

17:43.714 --> 17:45.673
in a decade, when someone
had to remind me

17:45.760 --> 17:46.891
that I didn't give Chad

17:46.978 --> 17:49.285
-his good night pill.
-Oh.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.506
Okay, well, I'll just,
uh, go get him.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.597
[boys grunting]

17:59.078 --> 18:02.385
This in no way justifies
what you said before.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.517
[grunts]

18:04.735 --> 18:07.173
-[banging]
-[sighs]

18:08.391 --> 18:10.567
Chad, I want to show you
a little project

18:10.654 --> 18:11.960
I've been working on.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.922
Look at this.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.881
You see where I took
my pen and I filled in

18:19.968 --> 18:21.839
the letters that needed
to be filled in.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.102
The "O's," the "A's,"

18:23.189 --> 18:25.495
the "E's," the "G's."

18:25.582 --> 18:28.150
The "Q's," the "P's,"
the "D's" and the "B's"?

18:28.237 --> 18:29.630
-Of course.
-That was you?

18:29.717 --> 18:32.198
-What about the nines?
-Yes.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.374
What about the circles
and the percent signs?

18:34.461 --> 18:36.506
Absolutely. Otherwise
you'll be left with

18:36.593 --> 18:39.074
that horrible feeling
of uncompleteness.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.865
[grunts]

18:51.042 --> 18:54.045
Here they are:
the sleepover buddies.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.134
Has he been okay?

18:55.221 --> 18:56.570
Oh, he's been fine.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.486
I think people prejudge
Chad sometimes.

18:59.573 --> 19:00.661
He's a good kid.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.619
Huh. Open.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.274
[grunts]

19:07.450 --> 19:09.887
I'm sorry, Dad.

19:09.974 --> 19:12.629
I thought you were
just being...

19:12.716 --> 19:14.762
I mean, I had no idea
you were...

19:17.721 --> 19:19.462
So how crazy are you?

19:19.549 --> 19:21.290
Let's just say

19:21.377 --> 19:24.598
that's my third
set of encyclopedias.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.527
Well, if we leave right now,

19:40.614 --> 19:41.789
we can still
catch the movie.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.312
What's this?

19:44.618 --> 19:47.098
The warranty?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.318
Hey, good for you, Chad.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.450
[door opens]

19:50.537 --> 19:51.929
Well, I give up.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.583
I'm throwing out that blender.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.585
You don't have to.
Look what Chad did.

19:55.672 --> 19:58.545
Pictures of things belong on
the things they're pictures of.

19:59.850 --> 20:02.592
Check and mate.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.116
[Dewey screams]

20:05.204 --> 20:06.161
[Hal screams]

20:06.248 --> 20:07.641
[Dewey screams]

20:07.728 --> 20:08.903
Dewey, what is it?

20:08.990 --> 20:10.252
Hal?

20:10.339 --> 20:11.514
[both scream]

20:11.601 --> 20:13.342
[screams]

20:13.429 --> 20:16.215
-[sighs]
-Honey...

20:16.302 --> 20:17.520
I'm sorry.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.043
You were lying
there asleep

20:19.130 --> 20:21.220
and you just looked
so beautiful.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.786
And the moment
was perfect

20:22.873 --> 20:24.223
and I never wanted it to end.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.833
And then I saw the camera,
and... and...

20:25.920 --> 20:27.574
I'm weak, Lois.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.706
I'm a little man.

20:29.793 --> 20:33.797
I know that I can never
apologize enough and...

20:33.884 --> 20:36.496
I'm sure right now you
don't even want to look at me.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.674
Hal.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.769
Everyone's going
to hear about this.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.292
We suck.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.163
We totally suck.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.730
I hate myself so much.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.471
What is wrong with us?

20:55.558 --> 20:57.560
Everyone else our age
heard it "empty house,"

20:57.647 --> 20:59.345
and we heard "haunted house."

20:59.432 --> 21:01.085
Are we just
socially stunted

21:01.172 --> 21:03.436
in some way that
makes us hopeless?

21:07.396 --> 21:09.268
I think half of them
were really scared.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.227
Yeah.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.703
