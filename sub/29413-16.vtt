WEBVTT

00:10.445 --> 00:12.708
Wine country,
here we come.
Yes.

00:12.751 --> 00:16.059
The car is loaded, and in
a few hours we will be, too.

00:16.103 --> 00:19.149
Ooh, this is gonna be
the best girls' trip ever.

00:19.193 --> 00:23.153
Gemma, I love America, but there
is no country like wine country.

00:23.197 --> 00:27.027
Okay, so one last
decision before we hit the road:

00:27.070 --> 00:29.812
Which one pairs best
with chardonnay,

00:29.855 --> 00:33.555
Jeanette or Tamika?
Ooh.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.426
Oh, what about that
curly black one

00:35.470 --> 00:37.559
that got us kicked out
of that club in Vegas?

00:37.602 --> 00:40.214
Dominique? Oh, no, no,
she's on the wagon.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.650
Oh.

00:41.693 --> 00:44.653
Uh-oh, Jeanette and Tamika.

00:44.696 --> 00:48.091
You can take one or the other,
but you can't take both.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.137
I'm not bailing
you three out again.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.662
Well, it looks like I'm gonna
have to go with Tamika,

00:53.705 --> 00:56.186
so you better behave.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.536
So you want to come watch
the transformation?

00:58.580 --> 01:01.191
Does my Aunt Mayvene dress up
her cats for the holidays?

01:01.235 --> 01:04.629
I was hoping no,
but sounds like yes.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.196
Yes.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.720
I'm just glad
she's not taking Dominique.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.114
That hair is trifling.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.769
What it do, C-Dawg?

01:13.812 --> 01:17.294
Oh, and I thought my biggest
problem was gonna be the wig.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.905
So, since the ladies
are gonna be gone,

01:19.949 --> 01:21.429
I got a little
surprise for us--

01:21.472 --> 01:24.867
front row tickets
to tonight's game.

01:24.910 --> 01:28.305
Seriously?
Courtside to the Laker game?

01:28.349 --> 01:31.265
C-Dawg is in.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.788
Well, actually,

01:32.831 --> 01:35.486
it's to the hockey game.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.230
Hockey? C-Dawg don't bark
for hockey.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.667
Well, come on,
it's gonna be great.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.148
Kings are playing the Red
Wings-- it's an epic rivalry.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.149
Why don't you
want to go?

01:46.193 --> 01:49.544
Well, for starters,
I'm black.

01:49.587 --> 01:53.025
I know that's what everybody
thinks about hockey,

01:53.069 --> 01:55.158
but the truth is, there's a lot
of black players now.

01:55.202 --> 01:58.509
Yeah, but they're probably all
Canadian, so that doesn't count.

01:58.553 --> 02:01.904
Come on, Calvin,
don't be such a Negative Nancy.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.384
I'll tell you what,
if at any point

02:03.427 --> 02:05.777
you're not having a good time,
you can leave.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.431
Great. Bye-bye.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.435
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:11.479 --> 02:12.741
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.139
Here's your beer.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.358
What'd I miss?
Nothing.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.882
Just a bunch of guys
with no vowels in their names

02:23.926 --> 02:25.145
skating in circles.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.148
I mean, the least
they could do

02:28.191 --> 02:30.411
is light the puck on fire
or something.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.153
Come on, Calvin,
you're missing

02:33.196 --> 02:34.719
the finer points
of the game here.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.679
I mean, look at these guys,
they're incredible athletes,

02:37.722 --> 02:40.943
skating 20 miles an hour
on a quarter-inch of steel.

02:40.986 --> 02:44.076
I don't know, man,
I-I'm just not seeing it.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.252
Oh!
Oh!

02:45.295 --> 02:46.253
Oh, I saw that.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.690
CROWD: Oh!Oh, and that!

02:48.733 --> 02:50.082
Oh!

02:50.126 --> 02:52.128
With hits like that,
who needs vowels?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.696
Yeah! Get him!

02:56.263 --> 02:59.222
Wow, this place
is beautiful.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.268
Now where's the wine?

03:01.311 --> 03:04.836
Ooh, there it is.
Thank you.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.403
I don't work here.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.452
Oh, well, this is good stuff,
you should get another one.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.238
Hello.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.632
Welcome to
Coastal Breeze Winery.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.025
Hi. We have a reservation
under Johnson.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.418
Hmm.
If possible,

03:21.462 --> 03:23.246
no balcony. We may get crazy,

03:23.290 --> 03:25.857
and it's safer if we're in
a room we can't fall out of.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.859
Oh, and, um,

03:27.903 --> 03:29.818
also nothing near
the elevator.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.429
We don't want to be bothered
by obnoxious drunks.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.822
GEMMA:
Oh, yeah.

03:35.084 --> 03:37.565
Fill 'er up.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.741
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.831
You're Mary J. Blige.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.311
What?

03:44.354 --> 03:47.357
Oh, no, honey,
it's the wig.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.753
My name is
Tina Butler.

03:51.796 --> 03:55.800
Oh, I get it. Keeping things
on the down low.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.106
Like me.

03:59.108 --> 04:02.198
Sorry to disappoint you,
but she really is Tina Butler.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.375
Well, for "Tina Butler's"
privacy,

04:05.419 --> 04:08.726
I'm going to upgrade you
to the penthouse suite.

04:08.770 --> 04:12.121
You can call
me Mary J.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.961
Man, there are two things
you don't want to be

04:26.004 --> 04:28.964
in a horror movie--
having sex or black.

04:34.012 --> 04:37.799
I mean, you, uh,
you're not scared, are you?

04:37.842 --> 04:40.323
Please, Malcolm,
I'm a grown man.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.020
I know scary movies
aren't real.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.384
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

04:57.427 --> 04:59.516
Us? Nothing.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.214
Can't-can't two brothers
scream together?

05:02.258 --> 05:04.695
MALCOLM:
Yeah, uh,

05:04.739 --> 05:07.045
Pop, what's with
the outfits?

05:07.089 --> 05:08.699
Oh, we went to the
hockey game together.

05:08.743 --> 05:12.094
Yeah, and it was awesome.
Give me some.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.057
Hey, so we on
for tomorrow night?

05:19.101 --> 05:21.451
Pink Floyd laser show
at the planetarium?

05:21.495 --> 05:23.061
Oh, you can
"planet" on it.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.324
Okay, see you
tomorrow, buddy.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.064
Bye, guys.
See you, Dave.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.370
Yeah.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.812
What?

05:34.856 --> 05:36.858
Uh, you're wearing
a hockey jersey,

05:36.901 --> 05:39.121
you're going to
a Pink Floyd laser show,

05:39.164 --> 05:41.166
and you just made a pun
about planets.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.517
Come on, man,
I thought it was "punny."

05:45.693 --> 05:47.172
Okay, it's official,

05:47.216 --> 05:49.871
you are turning into
a very tan Dave.

05:49.914 --> 05:53.048
I am not turning into Dave.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.485
So you're saying
you're a Pink Floyd fan?

05:55.529 --> 05:58.314
Yeah, all his new stuff
is great.

06:00.534 --> 06:03.493
I don't know, Pop, ever since
you and Dave became friends,

06:03.537 --> 06:05.277
you are kind of
a different person.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.757
MARTY:
Yeah, you don't go to

06:06.801 --> 06:09.064
Ernie's anymore, you don't
play dominoes with the boys,

06:09.107 --> 06:11.414
and just the other day
I saw you put a quarter

06:11.458 --> 06:13.373
in someone else's
parking meter.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.418
It's called paying it forward,

06:15.462 --> 06:18.595
which also happens to be
an excellent movie.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.511
Okay, who are you, and what
have you done with our father?

06:23.121 --> 06:24.558
Man, y'all tripping.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.777
You're just being
a couple of Negative Nancys.

06:28.039 --> 06:30.215
Who said that?

06:31.608 --> 06:33.436
Did you see
the bathroom?

06:33.480 --> 06:36.439
I mean, if this isn't
the nicest hotel I've ever seen,

06:36.483 --> 06:38.267
then my name isn't
Mary J. Blige.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.966
Your name isn't Mary J. Blige.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.665
It's Tina J. Liar.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.234
Oh, come on, Gemma,
we're not hurting anyone.

06:49.278 --> 06:52.020
I know, but aren't you worried
about getting caught?

06:52.063 --> 06:53.456
A little,

06:53.500 --> 06:56.720
but I think those free
massages they're sending up

06:56.764 --> 06:58.940
will melt those worries away.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.333
Wait, when did you
arrange that?

07:01.377 --> 07:04.293
I didn't,
my publicist did.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.251
And if anyone asks you,
you're my publicist.

07:06.295 --> 07:09.124
No. Tina,

07:09.167 --> 07:11.169
we are never gonna be able
to pull this off.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.563
Just because one guy thought
you were Mary J. Blige

07:13.607 --> 07:15.391
doesn't mean you can fool
a whole hotel.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.219
Of white people?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.309
Honey, I could tell them
I was Martin Luther King,

07:20.352 --> 07:21.571
and they'd believe it.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.053
All this free stuff
just doesn't

07:25.096 --> 07:26.707
seem like it's worth the risk.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.623
Gemma, this is
not about free stuff.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.841
Then what is it?

07:30.885 --> 07:33.061
Well, I know this
may sound silly,

07:33.104 --> 07:34.802
but ever since
I was a little girl,

07:34.845 --> 07:37.152
I always wanted to be
a famous singer,

07:37.195 --> 07:40.285
and now for the next
couple of days, I can be.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.939
I mean, didn't you ever
dream like that?

07:41.983 --> 07:44.376
Yes.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.597
Back when I was growing up
in Hickory Corners,

07:47.641 --> 07:51.209
I always dreamed of being
the Fall Festival Hog Queen.

07:53.298 --> 07:55.257
What is that and why?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.520
It is the biggest honor in town.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.784
You get a sash, a tiara, and
you get to ride down Main Street

08:00.828 --> 08:04.962
on a float pulled
by a team of pigs.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.225
What a relatable story.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.140
I would've won, too.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.665
I crushed
the bacon-eating contest,

08:11.708 --> 08:15.843
but that damn greased pig
got away from me every time.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.062
Gemma, I never thought
I would say this,

08:18.106 --> 08:21.152
but being
Mary J. Blige...

08:22.806 --> 08:25.113
...is my greased pig.

08:32.207 --> 08:35.427
BOTH:
Morning.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.567
Hey, look at that.

08:44.611 --> 08:48.353
Great minds dress alike.We're not dressed alike.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.660
My shirt has little
blue squares, and yours has, um,

08:50.704 --> 08:53.402
little blue boxes.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.883
I don't know.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.362
Looks pretty
similar to me.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.277
Yeah, well, no one else
would think that.

08:59.321 --> 09:03.543
Look at you two, twinsies!

09:10.985 --> 09:14.815
Hey, what's up,
boys?

09:14.858 --> 09:16.294
Well, what is up
with you,

09:16.338 --> 09:19.210
Run-DMC, you're having
a midlife crisis?

09:19.254 --> 09:22.649
Very funny.
For your information,

09:22.692 --> 09:25.042
I'm kicking it
with my old dance crew tonight.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.828
Your old dance crew?

09:27.871 --> 09:29.873
Didn't Keith just
have hip surgery?

09:29.917 --> 09:33.094
Yeah. You know, he's still got
his handicap placard,

09:33.137 --> 09:36.053
so we get to park
right in front of the club.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.533
But I thought you were
supposed to go

09:37.577 --> 09:38.969
to the planetarium
tonight?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.406
Yeah, man, but those planets
gonna be there forever.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.235
Keith's handicap placard,
it expires next week.

09:46.063 --> 09:49.458
Come on, Pop, is this because we
teased you about becoming Dave?

09:49.501 --> 09:54.115
No. This is about me getting
back in touch with my roots,

09:54.158 --> 09:55.812
about not forgetting who I am.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.858
And who exactly
is that?

09:57.901 --> 10:01.209
Calvi-tronic,
the Bionic Breaking Machine.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.220
Oh.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.961
I don't know about
a breaking machine,

10:14.004 --> 10:15.963
but something just
broke inside of me.

10:17.878 --> 10:21.708
Uh-oh, there's Dave.
What you gonna tell him?

10:21.751 --> 10:24.536
I'm a grown-ass man.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.973
I'm not afraid

10:26.016 --> 10:28.323
to tell him what's what.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.368
I'm gonna tell him
I'm sick.

10:32.806 --> 10:36.157
Hey, Calvin. You
ready to roll?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.507
Nice blanket. I have
one just like it.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.118
Can't go tonight, man.
I'm sick.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.467
Oh, no.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.295
Got sick at the hockey game.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.515
It was really cold
in there, man.

10:52.826 --> 10:53.914
Really? You know,

10:53.957 --> 10:55.567
they keep the rink
at 65 degrees.

10:55.611 --> 10:58.135
I know, but for black people,
that's like 32.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.922
Okay, well, feel
better, buddy.Yeah.

11:01.965 --> 11:05.273
Bye, guys. Okay...

11:05.316 --> 11:07.405
Damn, Pop,
that was cold.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.364
I know.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.235
32 degrees, baby.

11:17.024 --> 11:21.245
Ooh, that was an
amazing massage.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.377
Not as good
as the one yesterday,

11:22.420 --> 11:24.771
but better than the one
this morning.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.425
It was pretty great.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.689
But do you feel like
we're taking advantage?

11:30.951 --> 11:33.214
Ooh, yay! That must be
our second lobsters.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.520
Hi, Jeffrey.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.218
Hi. This is awkward, but...

11:37.261 --> 11:39.655
We can explain. I wanted
to be Hog Queen.

11:41.048 --> 11:44.704
Don't... don't
mind my publicist.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.401
She has a pill problem.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.796
So what can we do for you?

11:49.839 --> 11:52.624
Well, one of our guests
is celebrating her birthday

11:52.668 --> 11:55.323
later tonight in the lounge,
and I was hoping...

11:55.366 --> 11:58.282
that Ms. Blige could pop by
for a quick hello.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.328
Okay, honey,

12:00.371 --> 12:02.939
that sounds like fun.Oh, and you know

12:02.983 --> 12:05.463
what would be even more fun?
If she sings "Happy Birthday."

12:05.507 --> 12:06.856
Oh, yeah,
that'd be real...

12:06.900 --> 12:08.075
Wait, what?!

12:09.163 --> 12:12.035
Oh, that is so amazing.
Thank you.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.950
I am much obliged.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.169
You see
what I did there?

12:15.212 --> 12:16.170
Did you see it?
Fun.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.607
Okay.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.522
What the hell, Gemma?

12:20.565 --> 12:22.263
How tight is
that towel?

12:23.438 --> 12:25.135
Tina. Don't you see?

12:25.179 --> 12:26.441
This is your dream.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.225
Tonight's your night
to be famous.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.140
Yeah, but as soon
as I open my mouth,

12:30.184 --> 12:32.621
they're gonna know
that I'm not Mary J. Blige.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.972
No, they won't.
You have an amazing voice.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.583
Yeah.
But still!

12:38.627 --> 12:42.239
Besides, it's like you said,
this is a winery.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.807
Everyone here is whiter
than the chardonnay.

12:44.851 --> 12:48.245
Well, it does sound
kind of fun.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.160
Now you're talking.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.380
And, hey, maybe I could be
your backup singer.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.425
Stay in your lane, pig girl.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.431
Oh, hey, uh, Dave.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.173
I thought you were going
to the planetarium.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.393
Well, I was, but I realized
it wouldn't be as much fun

13:05.436 --> 13:07.264
without Calvin, so I decided
to stay home

13:07.308 --> 13:08.526
and make him some soup.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.527
How's he doing?

13:09.571 --> 13:12.095
Better.Worse.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.531
Well, which is it?

13:13.575 --> 13:15.359
Worse.Better.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.842
Okay, well, uh, maybe
the soup will help.Yeah.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.279
Just tell him I'll check in
on him tomorrow.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.329
Yeah.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.636
Hey.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.077
Calvin, what are you doing
out of bed,

13:37.120 --> 13:38.774
and why are you dressed
so funky fresh?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.950
Uh,

13:40.994 --> 13:42.734
I went to the drugstore
to get some medicine.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.301
Where is it?

13:44.345 --> 13:46.608
Damn it, I knew
I forgot something.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.350
Hold on.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.179
Calvin, did you lie to me
about being sick?

13:52.222 --> 13:54.964
No. Because I amsick.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.531
I let down my defenses

13:56.574 --> 14:00.013
and got all infected
with your Dave-ness.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.016
Wh-- Infected?

14:03.059 --> 14:05.322
Yeah, I mean, you got
me going to hockey.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.411
I mean, you and I
are dressing alike.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.500
The other day
a Taylor Swift song came on,

14:09.544 --> 14:11.415
and I didn't even turn it off.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.418
Actually,
he turned it up.

14:17.247 --> 14:20.250
I didn't know having things
in common was being infected.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.252
I thought that
was being friends.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.428
Uh...

14:24.472 --> 14:25.821
Dave.No, you know
what, Calvin?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.431
You said your piece.
Enjoy the soup.

14:27.475 --> 14:30.478
It's infected,
too. With love!

14:34.961 --> 14:37.877
Ooh... thank you for
making me do this, Gemma.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.879
I'm feeling
kind of hyped.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.446
Oh, good.
You're here.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.535
Thank you again
for doing this, Ms. Blige.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.059
Okay.
So the birthday girl's name

14:46.102 --> 14:47.582
is Cynthia,
and she is sitting

14:47.625 --> 14:48.496
right over there.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.415
She is not going
to believe this!

14:54.458 --> 14:57.113
No, she is not.

14:57.157 --> 15:01.204
Okay, so I'm gonna go
introduce you. Showtime!

15:02.597 --> 15:04.468
Tina, they're not white!

15:04.512 --> 15:05.513
They're gonna know.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.732
Okay. All right.
Gemma...

15:07.776 --> 15:08.995
let's get the
hell out of here.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
the one and only

15:11.084 --> 15:12.563
Mary J. Blige!

15:12.607 --> 15:15.262
Oh... Gemma.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.569
How you doing?

15:18.613 --> 15:20.658
Oh, what the
hell are we gonna do?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.965
Okay. Okay.
It's gonna be fine.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.010
You're gonna
go up there,

15:24.053 --> 15:25.663
you're gonna
sing your heart out,

15:25.707 --> 15:27.970
and you're gonna
live your dream. Okay?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.406
You're right.
You're right.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.407
This is my chance.
Yes.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.582
I got this.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.888
But just in case...

15:34.585 --> 15:37.458
It'll be harder to describe me
to the police.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.810
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.291
Hey, how you doing?

15:44.334 --> 15:46.467

17:38.970 --> 17:40.494
You don't want
to catch anything else.

17:40.537 --> 17:43.366
I've been told my laugh
is pretty contagious.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.325
Look, man...

17:45.368 --> 17:46.935
I'm sorry if I hurt
your feelings,

17:46.978 --> 17:49.372
but I just felt like
your Dave-ness

17:49.416 --> 17:51.505
was rubbing off on me too much.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.072
Well, what's wrong with that?

17:53.115 --> 17:55.378
Why can't friends
rub off on each other?

17:57.337 --> 18:00.427
Rubbing off on people
is completely natural.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.472
I welcome people
rubbing off on me.

18:04.779 --> 18:08.130
If anybody's listening,
we're just neighbors!

18:08.174 --> 18:10.741
I just don't understand
why it's such a bad thing

18:10.785 --> 18:13.179
for friends to
influence each other.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.050
You don't think that I've
changed because of you?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.747
How have youchanged?

18:16.791 --> 18:18.575
I'm more assertive,
like you,

18:18.619 --> 18:20.360
I'm more confident,
like you,

18:20.403 --> 18:22.275
and if someone's being
a jackass, I now tell them

18:22.318 --> 18:23.667
they're being
a jackass...

18:23.711 --> 18:25.887
jackass.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.584
One more compliment like that,

18:27.628 --> 18:29.020
and we're gonna have a problem.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.806
Calvin, we already
do have a problem.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.416
Why would I want to be
friends with someone

18:33.460 --> 18:36.202
who thinks being me
is such a bad thing?

18:36.245 --> 18:37.551
'Cause I'm dope.

18:37.594 --> 18:41.294
And your attitude--
it's... wickity-wack.

18:42.730 --> 18:47.474
Look, Dave, I don't think
being you is a bad thing.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.171
All right, you're a good dude.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.391
But Calvin Butler has an edge.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.915
And around here,
people see me a certain way,

18:53.958 --> 18:55.482
and I don't want to lose that.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.874
Fine, but don't blame me

18:56.918 --> 18:59.877
because Taylor Swift sang
her way into your heart.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.489
I don't know what it is,
she just gets me.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.449
But you're right.

19:06.493 --> 19:11.150
I shouldn't have done that,
and, uh... I'm sorry.

19:12.368 --> 19:15.502
You know what?
It, it's okay.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.591
You know what's better
than okay?

19:17.634 --> 19:19.332
That soup you made.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.640
I knewyou'd like it.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.599
I used the parsnips we got
from the farmers market.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.209
Oh, yeah, right.
From the lady...

19:27.253 --> 19:30.169
BOTH:
With the yellow overalls.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.649
No, that's too much.Yeah, this is
getting weird. Okay.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.226
Hey, man. We were
in the middle of a game.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.445
Not anymore.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.448
It's been canceled
on the account of dance.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.538
Oh, come on, Dad.
We don't want to see

19:51.581 --> 19:53.192
your tired old dance moves.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.325
Yeah. And I'm not
helping you up this time.

19:56.369 --> 19:59.502
Nah, man. What you're about
to see is all new.
