00:00.166 --> 00:02.134
Virginia:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:02.136 --> 00:03.602
It's my first day back
at my old job.

00:03.604 --> 00:07.539
Whole space up here belongs
to masters and johnson now.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.173
I'm the new girl.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.508
Betty can also help
with the books.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.344
I'm not sure
I can scrape together
this month's rent.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.045
You will scrape, flo.

00:13.047 --> 00:16.548
Well, I was wondering
if I could fill one of
those on-call positions

00:16.550 --> 00:18.717
In return for your
waiving the charge

00:18.719 --> 00:20.919
For mrs. Holden's
and my room.

00:20.921 --> 00:21.720
What do you
want with coral?

00:21.722 --> 00:24.757
Just because you're
coral's boyfriend doesn't...
I'm her brother.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.592
I want us
to get back together.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.060
I've moved on, austin.

00:28.062 --> 00:31.397
Virginia:  <i>Barbara,</i>
<i>I thought that you</i>
<i>and dr. Greathouse,</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.899
There was a sexual...
We did everything.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.434
Just not the normal way.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.803
In terms of your
participating in the study...

00:37.805 --> 00:38.871
Don't feel bad
about rejecting me.

00:38.873 --> 00:41.607
You're not gonna take
my mother's money.

00:41.609 --> 00:42.975
I had to help you, son.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.276
I couldn't not.
Not again.

00:44.278 --> 00:47.079
Did you know that
we haven't had sex
in over a year?

00:47.081 --> 00:50.649
I think bill
is under a lot of pressure.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.718
Yvette: (sighs)
nothing is happening.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.020
How long do you
want me to try?

01:00.026 --> 01:02.661
(theme music playing)

01:47.307 --> 01:49.007
Francis: Rita hayworth,

01:49.009 --> 01:50.342
Ruth taylor,

01:50.344 --> 01:52.945
Lana turner,
marilyn monroe...

01:52.947 --> 01:54.313
They're all doing it.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.282
Rhinoplasty,
chin implants,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.084
Face lifts.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.321
Lift as in a literal...
No.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.522
It's a basic elevation

02:03.524 --> 02:05.791
And re-draping
of the skin.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.458
Remember in med school,

02:06.460 --> 02:07.860
They used to say
plastic surgery

02:07.862 --> 02:11.363
Was for cleft palates
and burn victims.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.232
People are
finally realizing

02:13.234 --> 02:15.300
Just because you're born
with one face

02:15.302 --> 02:17.736
Doesn't mean
you're stuck with it.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.306
Obstetrician,
plastic surgeon.

02:21.308 --> 02:25.511
Two of rochester medical
school's alumni made good.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.947
You were supposed to be
an english professor.

02:29.249 --> 02:31.483
For 15 minutes, maybe.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.552
Do you still read
the way you used to?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.954
Melville in a day,
tolstoy in a week?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.956
I don't have
the time anymore.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.260
Well, you didn't
have the time
in school, either,

02:41.262 --> 02:44.096
But you still
managed it.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.867
"suffering has been greater
than all other teaching.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.370
"I have been
bent and broken,

02:51.372 --> 02:54.973
"but I hope
into a better shape."

02:56.809 --> 03:00.212
Charles dickens.
I know who it is.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.714
You wrote that to me.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.585
That was the last letter
I ever got from you.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.420
Whenever you boys
are ready.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.555
What are you doing?

03:09.557 --> 03:11.790
You came all the way
from kansas city.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.091
Absolutely not.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.960
No, this is my treat, frank.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.762
End of discussion.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.265
(chuckles)

03:21.367 --> 03:22.868
Professor tolan
used to say

03:22.870 --> 03:25.971
You were
the biggest pain
in the ass

03:25.973 --> 03:29.541
To ever grace
his lecture hall.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.476
I see some things
don't change.

03:31.478 --> 03:34.846
It was great
seeing you. Really.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.815
You don't think
I drove six
and a half hours

03:36.817 --> 03:40.152
To discuss
marilyn monroe's
nose job, do you?

03:40.154 --> 03:43.121
I don't know
if you heard,

03:43.123 --> 03:47.125
But after all my years
of bachelorhood debauchery,

03:47.127 --> 03:49.494
I finally settled down.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.763
I did.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.566
Through the grapevine.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.034
The grapevine.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.903
Congratulations.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.671
As soon as
we got hitched,

03:59.673 --> 04:02.341
First thing,
I cleared out my office,

04:02.343 --> 04:04.209
Set it up as a nursery.

04:04.211 --> 04:07.746
Pauline and I,
we've been trying,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.715
But a year on,

04:09.717 --> 04:12.417
I'm starting to worry.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.354
I'm hoping you can help us.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.188
I...

04:16.190 --> 04:20.492
I do know a few
fertility specialists
in kansas city,

04:20.494 --> 04:25.831
But I could easily have
made a recommendation
over the phone.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.200
Why would I see
a stranger in kansas city

04:28.202 --> 04:29.034
When I'm sitting here,

04:29.036 --> 04:33.972
Talking to the leading
fertility expert
in the midwest?

04:36.442 --> 04:36.975
(elevator dings)

04:36.977 --> 04:40.812
So, we have rejected
126 subjects
from the study

04:40.814 --> 04:41.613
Due to dysfunction.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.482
That's nearly a third
of all applicants.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.384
In the future,
we'll make a special note

04:45.386 --> 04:47.019
Of subjects
presenting dysfunction.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.288
We can build
a patient base from there.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.591
Or from here.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.396
M-25-106-nv.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.798
Son of a bitch.
Wake up.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.867
Impotence.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.969
F-34-21-nv.

05:03.971 --> 05:04.803
Dyspareunia.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.372
Is it supposed
to feel like knives?

05:10.109 --> 05:12.444
M-28-364-nv.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.845
Ejaculatory incompetence.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.915
Don't hold back
on my account.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.983
Nv?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.518
Non-viable.

05:20.186 --> 05:22.454
You kept them all.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.822
Why?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.223
Well, if they're
brave enough to come in,

05:25.225 --> 05:27.893
We should at least
keep a record
of that bravery,

05:27.895 --> 05:29.795
Don't you think?

05:40.406 --> 05:43.475
You're a magician
with those fingers.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.744
Well, what brings you
in today, miss packer?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.279
My arches are as flat
as old soda pop.

05:47.281 --> 05:50.115
At work, I'm hobbling
up the stairs
like a polio baby.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.417
Girl in the building,
virginia johnson,

05:52.419 --> 05:53.385
She saw me, said,

05:53.387 --> 05:56.088
"flo, you need dr. Langham
and you need him now."

05:56.090 --> 05:57.556
Oh, you're
a virginia referral.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.157
Yeah, I work
right next door to her.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.025
At cal-o-metric?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.860
No kidding?
You know, my wife...

06:01.862 --> 06:05.163
Uh, my ex-wife
used to work there, too.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.965
Oh, I know.
I was her boss.

06:06.967 --> 06:11.236
Oh, the stories
I used to hear about
elise langham's husband.

06:11.238 --> 06:15.507
You've been a very
naughty orthopedist,
dr. Langham.

06:16.275 --> 06:16.975
(grunts)

06:16.977 --> 06:19.244
Well, with what
I'm seeing here,
miss packer,

06:19.246 --> 06:22.180
I think you may be
a prime candidate
for surgery.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.349
Oh, I can't wait
for surgery.
(water running)

06:24.351 --> 06:26.451
This week's our yearly
sales conference.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.486
I don't want to be
dragging around

06:27.488 --> 06:30.322
Like quasimodo
in the bell tower.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.891
I could offer you
a cortisone shot.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.328
In the long run,
I recommend you
consider losing weight.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.630
You're putting
tremendous pressure
on your feet.

06:38.632 --> 06:42.134
Some men
like a lady with curves.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.602
You?

06:43.870 --> 06:44.569
(sighs)

06:44.571 --> 06:46.905
In spite of what
you may have heard,
miss packer,

06:46.907 --> 06:52.077
My relationship
with my patients
is strictly professional.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.612
Sure.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.747
But somehow,
I can't help but to think

06:55.749 --> 06:58.850
That if I lost 50 pounds
and dropped 10 years,

06:58.852 --> 07:01.753
You might be whistling
a different tune.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.390
Look, I made some
very foolish decisions
in the past...

07:05.392 --> 07:08.160
Decisions that have
made my life here
at the hospital

07:08.162 --> 07:09.294
A living hell.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.464
Passed up for promotion
the last two years,

07:12.466 --> 07:16.701
And, uh, my colleagues
actually call me don,

07:16.703 --> 07:17.436
As in don juan.

07:17.438 --> 07:20.005
Frankly,
I would give anything
to walk through that door

07:20.007 --> 07:21.139
And never come
back here again,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.141
Start over
somewhere else,

07:23.143 --> 07:24.342
Somewhere new.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.211
But seeing as
that's not going to happen,

07:26.213 --> 07:28.914
The best thing
for me to do is to...

07:30.683 --> 07:32.617
Stay out of trouble.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.518
So, uh,
if you don't mind,

07:33.520 --> 07:38.457
I will ask the nurse
to prepare your
cortisone shot for you.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.493
Nurse.
(door closes)

07:42.695 --> 07:44.429
(door opens)

07:49.235 --> 07:53.071
While I have
your attention...

07:56.542 --> 07:59.478
I thought you might be
interested to know

07:59.480 --> 08:02.247
That we're being audited.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.284
The irs wants 4,000 bucks
in taxes,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.420
With interest.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.723
You said
we were exempt from taxes.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.326
No, I said companies
that apply for

08:14.328 --> 08:17.696
And receive 501(c)
not-for-profit
organization status

08:17.698 --> 08:21.600
Under the internal
revenue code
were exempt from taxes.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.767
You haven't applied?

08:22.769 --> 08:26.037
No, because
in order to apply,

08:26.039 --> 08:28.006
You need to have
a board of trustees,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.441
Like I told you
two months ago.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.076
I'm working on that.

08:32.078 --> 08:36.515
Libby and I are
having dinner tonight
with sam duncan.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.450
I'm assuming
that if I can convince

08:38.452 --> 08:41.419
The chief of police
to join our board,

08:41.421 --> 08:43.421
Others will follow.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.291
You're going
to convince him?

08:47.026 --> 08:48.627
Why not?

08:50.096 --> 08:51.730
Virginia?
Virginia: Yes?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.533
You got any plans
tonight?

08:55.167 --> 08:56.735
Not at the moment.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.803
Well, you do now.

09:02.975 --> 09:07.879
William:
Subjects are unmarried
and randomly assigned.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.615
(woman moaning)

09:15.488 --> 09:17.389
Darkening of the areolae.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.623
I was thinking,

09:18.625 --> 09:20.692
What if
every dysfunction

09:20.694 --> 09:24.062
Had a male version
and a female version?

09:25.398 --> 09:25.797
Meaning?

09:25.799 --> 09:29.134
Meaning, look at
normal sexual functioning.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.269
There's a kind of
symmetry to it.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.871
Swelling of the testes
in men,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.806
Swelling of the vulva
in women,

09:34.808 --> 09:36.241
So what if the opposite
were true, too?

09:36.243 --> 09:40.579
Vaginismus could be
the female equivalent
of impotence.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.881
Well, impotence
has a significantly

09:42.883 --> 09:45.784
Higher rate of occurrence
than vaginismus.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.720
Kinsey puts it upward
of 27% of men

09:48.722 --> 09:51.056
That have trouble
achieving erection.

09:51.058 --> 09:51.823
Granted, that's anecdotal,

09:51.825 --> 09:55.460
But wilhelm stekel
makes the number
closer to 50.

09:55.462 --> 09:58.363
You've looked
into this already.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.166
Uh,
preliminary research only.

10:01.168 --> 10:01.967
(clears throat)

10:01.969 --> 10:05.870
Um, I was wondering
if I could take
an extra couple hours

10:05.872 --> 10:07.439
For my lunch break
tomorrow.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.307
It's just, um, it's...

10:09.309 --> 10:12.310
My dad's funeral,
is all.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.214
Oh, I'm so sorry, lester.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.817
Uh, yes, of course,
take all the time
you need.

10:18.819 --> 10:22.153
Actually,
if I could leave
a little early today,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.922
I'm trying to write
my eulogy.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.056
I was up all night
working on it,

10:25.058 --> 10:27.258
But I just can't seem
to crack it.

10:27.693 --> 10:30.462
Why don't you
try it out on us first?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.030
Really?

10:32.032 --> 10:35.867
I guess I could use
some feedback
at this point.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.971
Um...

10:40.206 --> 10:42.674
"my dad had a long,
happy life.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.109
"he was a lawyer.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.411
"he loved his family."

10:47.613 --> 10:50.081
That's all I have so far.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.784
It's a fantastic start.

10:52.786 --> 10:57.789
And maybe
the rest of it will come
a bit more naturally

10:57.791 --> 11:00.692
If you were to try,
I don't know, uh,

11:00.694 --> 11:01.493
Maybe something visual.

11:01.495 --> 11:05.330
My cousin, for example,
she had a slide show
at her wedding.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.798
To be honest,
it was not...

11:06.800 --> 11:07.499
It was not very good,

11:07.501 --> 11:11.703
But yours, I think,
would be terrific.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.039
(both moaning)

11:14.041 --> 11:16.207
Climax.
(stopwatch clicks)

11:24.316 --> 11:26.117
Nervous?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.919
Thirsty.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.289
$5 for prime rib?
That is highway robbery.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.159
If it goes well tonight,
it'll be worth the price.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.027
I still don't understand
why you need a board.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.330
When you go
to the grocery store,
why do you buy...

11:39.332 --> 11:39.998
Campbell's soup?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.466
Why not some
other variety?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.034
Well, I know
campbell's is good.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.235
You trust the name,
the label.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.071
That's precisely
what a board is.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.672
It's packaging.

11:47.674 --> 11:48.339
And the right packaging

11:48.341 --> 11:50.375
Is what will
allow us to get
our tax-exempt status

11:50.377 --> 11:52.811
So we can get through
this audit in one piece.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.679
You've been audited?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.983
Here they are now.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.787
Florence:
Caroline is just
at her wit's end

12:02.789 --> 12:04.322
With the veiled
prophet ball.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.157
William: The thing is,
our study,

12:06.159 --> 12:07.992
It isn't really
about sex at all.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.795
Do you know what
the number-one cause
of divorce

12:10.797 --> 12:13.298
In the state
of missouri is?

12:13.432 --> 12:15.800
Sexual dissatisfaction.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.902
And the children
of divorce,

12:17.904 --> 12:18.636
As I'm sure
you do know,

12:18.638 --> 12:21.339
They're 10 times
more likely to pursue
a life of crime.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.509
An alarming statistic
with a clear correlation.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.444
If we can save
even one child

12:26.446 --> 12:27.445
From the scourge
of divorce...

12:27.447 --> 12:31.683
Then we feel
we've done our small part
in the fight against crime.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.151
So, all of
these volunteers,

12:33.153 --> 12:35.620
They're all
married couples?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.590
Of course.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.160
(sighs)
I don't know.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.997
Me being on the board
of something like this.

12:46.198 --> 12:49.067
I'm gonna
have to think about it.

12:49.568 --> 12:50.802
You know what I think?

12:50.804 --> 12:52.036
I think we should
share a table

12:52.038 --> 12:54.405
At the veiled prophet ball
this Friday.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.141
Mrs. Duncan's
been bending your ear

12:56.143 --> 12:58.042
About her chairing
the leadership committee?

12:58.044 --> 12:58.676
(laughing)

12:58.678 --> 13:01.679
Well, truly,
with the economy
the way it is,

13:01.681 --> 13:04.149
If we don't receive
more donations by Friday,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.284
We'll have to make some
devastating decisions.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.153
Well, if you are looking
for more volunteers,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.021
I would be
more than happy
to lend a hand.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.524
Look at you.
One good idea after another.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.392
I wouldn't want
to impose, but...

13:14.394 --> 13:16.294
It is a great cause, lib.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.228
Of course it is.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.431
Well, virginia,
you must come, too.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.035
I've always wondered
about the veiled prophet

13:24.037 --> 13:26.971
With his strange mask
and costumes.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.707
Well, you'll come
with me and bill.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.509
We'll go as a triumvirate.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.577
Florence: Fabulous!

13:32.579 --> 13:35.780
(sam and florence laugh)

13:38.818 --> 13:41.986
William: I, uh,
tried to find a...

13:41.988 --> 13:43.621
An opening
in the calendar,

13:43.623 --> 13:44.422
But unfortunately,

13:44.424 --> 13:47.358
All the, uh, regular
appointment times
were taken.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.527
We don't mind
getting up with the birds.
Yeah.

13:49.529 --> 13:54.833
My staff usually
opens the office,
turns on the lights.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.401
Ah.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.672
Uh, just...

14:00.674 --> 14:02.974
It is such a pleasure
to finally meet you,

14:02.976 --> 14:06.144
Although I feel like
I've known you forever,
really.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.613
Francis has told me
all about the trouble

14:08.615 --> 14:10.315
You two used to get up to.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.750
Well, bill was always
better behaved
than I was.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.186
Everyone was
better behaved than you.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.121
(chuckles)

14:17.656 --> 14:19.357
Folks that knew him
back then,

14:19.359 --> 14:20.024
They always ask me,

14:20.026 --> 14:23.261
"how did you
ever get this bum
to stop running around

14:23.263 --> 14:25.163
"and put a ring
on your finger?"

14:25.165 --> 14:26.931
It is an impressive feat.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.032
(pauline chuckles)

14:28.034 --> 14:33.872
Once you finish
filling out the, uh,
intake forms,

14:33.874 --> 14:37.342
I'll be taking
samples of blood, urine,

14:37.344 --> 14:40.712
And semen for testing.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.314
Are there any questions?

14:45.484 --> 14:47.552
Pauline and I
have been wondering

14:47.554 --> 14:48.419
If there's
any way to know

14:48.421 --> 14:51.756
If the issues
we've been having

14:51.758 --> 14:55.393
Have anything to do
with my disease.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.598
My alcoholism.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.534
Your...

15:03.669 --> 15:05.737
I assumed you knew.

15:05.739 --> 15:06.771
The grapevine and all.

15:06.773 --> 15:11.676
Francis hasn't had a drop
in almost a year.

15:13.212 --> 15:19.217
I don't believe
past drinking should have
any impact whatsoever

15:19.219 --> 15:21.753
On your chances
of conception.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.988
(sighs)
(chuckles)

15:23.990 --> 15:28.126
Well, I can't tell you
what a relief that is, bill.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.708
Sorry. I got stuck
with a patient.

15:44.877 --> 15:49.013
I didn't think
we had any appointments
until 10:00 today.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.150
Where should we begin?

15:53.185 --> 15:56.521
Um, well,
male impotence,

15:56.622 --> 15:57.655
Vaginismus,

15:57.657 --> 16:01.059
Female dyspareunia,
male dyspareunia.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.562
Well, we're in
the volume business.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.463
I suppose
it makes the most sense

16:05.465 --> 16:08.533
To start where we can
make the most difference.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.202
Male impotence it is.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.205
We can start with
the sexual history
questionnaires.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.707
Look for any patterns.

16:15.709 --> 16:19.477
Similar backgrounds,
psychological abnormalities.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.713
I think we should
stay focused on the data

16:21.715 --> 16:24.582
About the empirical work
we've gathered.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.151
Sexual histories
are just a collection
of anecdotes.

16:27.153 --> 16:31.923
Yes, but the data by itself
only tells part of the story.

16:31.925 --> 16:32.857
We're not telling stories.

16:32.859 --> 16:37.462
We have to devise
practical methods
for treating these men.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.737
Start by compiling
a list of techniques

16:45.739 --> 16:50.908
That have already
proven a degree
of effectiveness.

16:53.178 --> 16:56.247
Betty might be a place
to start.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.384
If you're a taxi driver,
you got lousy tips.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.153
If you're a mailman,
you got barking dogs,

17:02.155 --> 17:04.555
And if you're a hooker,
you got this.

17:04.557 --> 17:08.226
Were there
any methods in particular
that you found useful?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.528
Hands, mouth, you know.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.195
Whatever worked.

17:11.197 --> 17:14.332
In other words,
an aggressive approach
seemed most effective?

17:14.334 --> 17:16.134
And then it wouldn't be.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.802
Sometimes I'd give the guy

17:17.804 --> 17:20.838
A special tonic
straight from india.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.173
I'd warn him about it first,
though.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.509
I'd say,
"sure you want to take this?

17:24.511 --> 17:25.576
"if you take
too much of it,

17:25.578 --> 17:28.279
"your erection
might last forever."

17:28.281 --> 17:30.481
And the ingredients were?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.884
Rum and cayenne pepper.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.720
If you could get
this guy to believe it,

17:35.722 --> 17:38.489
You could get that guy
to believe it, too.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.557
Placebo effect.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.527
Hmm, we called it
punch for suckers.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.594
And if that didn't work,

17:43.596 --> 17:45.263
We had a couple
penis pumps lying around,

17:45.265 --> 17:47.231
But, ugh,
those were a real pain.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.499
They'd make your arm sore
for a couple days.

17:48.501 --> 17:53.538
Clearly, this is not
just a physical problem.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.407
Once, I was in the backseat
with gordon garrett,

17:56.409 --> 17:57.775
My high-school beau.

17:57.777 --> 18:01.079
He never had
any problems whatsoever
with performance,

18:01.081 --> 18:04.782
But this one night,
he found his mother's
handkerchief

18:04.784 --> 18:06.184
Tucked in between
the cushions

18:06.186 --> 18:07.385
And smelling
like her perfume,

18:07.387 --> 18:11.389
And that was the end
of that.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.256
Exactly.

18:12.258 --> 18:16.160
Most of the time,
it's a mental block.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.361
You know, guy feels
lousy about himself,

18:17.363 --> 18:19.764
Guy feels guilty
about his wife
or his mother

18:19.766 --> 18:22.633
Or he's got a thing
for farm animals
or whatever,

18:22.635 --> 18:25.303
But you're still stuck
with the same problem...

18:25.305 --> 18:30.475
How to get it up
so he can finish off,
pay up, and get out.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.780
Hey, while we're
on the subject
of happy customers,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.982
What's this file
you left here?

18:37.984 --> 18:39.383
Uh, it's the masons.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.453
New fertility patients.
I saw them this morning.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.488
Early this morning.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.723
Mr. Mason was only available
before 7:00.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.724
Oh, I didn't see them
in the...

18:46.726 --> 18:50.228
I'm gonna need you
to have the lab
rush their test results.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.029
You have any idea
how much that costs?

18:52.031 --> 18:54.732
I don't care
how much it costs.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.901
Just get it done, please.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.039
(upbeat music plays)

19:02.041 --> 19:04.909
Kent's voice:
<i>Are you in a rut?</i>

19:04.911 --> 19:07.011
<i>Do you eat to excess?</i>

19:07.013 --> 19:11.249
<i>Does your husband</i>
<i>keep his eyes glued</i>
<i>to the television</i>

19:11.251 --> 19:14.051
<i>When you step</i>
<i>into the room?</i>

19:14.053 --> 19:15.653
You get the idea.

19:16.588 --> 19:17.255
Our new radio spot.

19:17.257 --> 19:21.058
Ah, I can't believe
kent underleigh
is your spokesman.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.127
I used to listen to him
on that old radio soap,

19:23.129 --> 19:25.263
<i>Hospital of love,</i>
in junior high.

19:25.265 --> 19:29.066
Unfortunately,
talent like that
doesn't come cheap.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.268
Mr. Underleigh requires

19:30.270 --> 19:31.369
Four-star accommodations,

19:31.371 --> 19:33.371
Although I did get
a fabulous deal

19:33.373 --> 19:35.306
On a hotel room
outside the city.

19:35.308 --> 19:40.011
I'm flying him in
to give the keynote address
at our sales conference.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.279
Ah.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.514
Well, um,
as I was saying,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.851
For just a small donation
to the veiled prophet ball,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.753
Cal-o-metric will be
featured in the program

19:48.755 --> 19:50.488
Alongside other businesses
like...

19:50.490 --> 19:52.323
Look, I'd love
to help you out, lib.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.524
Can I call you lib?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.526
But with this
sales conference,

19:55.528 --> 19:58.863
I'm leaking cash
like an old bladder.

19:59.631 --> 20:00.331
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.266
You got to spend a mint
to make a mint.

20:02.268 --> 20:05.336
And I'm sick
of being a big fish
in a rain puddle.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.638
By 1965,
I want cal-o-metric

20:07.640 --> 20:11.409
To be the number-one
diet product in america.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.109
Well, in that case,

20:12.111 --> 20:13.578
You need to get
the message out there.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.479
An advertisement
in this year's program

20:15.481 --> 20:17.782
Will be seen
by hundreds of women...

20:17.784 --> 20:18.916
Women, I might add,

20:18.918 --> 20:22.553
With significant
disposable income.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.389
Rich women.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.091
Unhappy women.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.860
Just imagine
the exposure.

20:33.098 --> 20:34.999
(sighs)

20:36.635 --> 20:38.135
See?

20:38.704 --> 20:40.538
Leaking again.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.873
(pen clicks)

20:43.909 --> 20:46.544
Virginia:
Mind if I join you?

20:54.953 --> 20:55.886
How did you find me?

20:55.888 --> 20:59.790
You wrote
your work address
on your study application.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.593
And they said upstairs
that I'd find you here.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.497
Barbara, I feel terrible
about how we left things.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.599
Please, don't.

21:09.501 --> 21:10.935
Don't feel bad for me.

21:10.937 --> 21:15.773
In fact, I thought
maybe you could help us.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.077
I'm setting up
for the 4:00.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.946
I hope I didn't
miss too much.

21:21.948 --> 21:26.083
Uh, we decided
to begin our work
on dysfunction

21:26.085 --> 21:28.085
With male impotence.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.023
How was it this morning?

21:32.025 --> 21:34.392
I ended up
putting together
a slide show

21:34.394 --> 21:36.460
Like virginia suggested.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.996
I spent hours
digging through
old photos...

21:38.998 --> 21:40.965
Shoeboxes full of them.

21:40.967 --> 21:41.899
178 photos.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.168
Guess how many
I was in.

21:44.170 --> 21:44.502
Two.

21:44.504 --> 21:47.872
So, you've always
been the one
behind the camera.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.007
Just like everything else
in my life.

21:50.009 --> 21:53.878
The action seems
to be happening
to somebody else.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.181
I'm just like those guys.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.349
Those guys?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.351
In the, you know...

22:00.353 --> 22:02.953
Dysfunctional way.

22:03.021 --> 22:04.789
I, uh...

22:04.791 --> 22:05.589
I have...

22:05.591 --> 22:07.992
Vaginismus
is the medical term,

22:07.994 --> 22:11.762
When the vagina
becomes impenetrable.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.498
Vaginismus, then.
That's...

22:15.200 --> 22:19.770
That's why gil left me
after two years.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.740
After window shopping
for rings.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.209
That surprises me a bit.

22:25.211 --> 22:28.079
Most men
appreciate a woman

22:28.081 --> 22:32.283
Open to trying
different forms of sex.

22:32.285 --> 22:33.417
Well, not gil.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.786
His dad was a minister
at one of those

22:35.788 --> 22:38.289
Hellfire and brimstone
churches.

22:38.291 --> 22:42.827
So, having sex
the normal way
was hard enough for gil,

22:42.829 --> 22:44.895
Let alone putting his...

22:45.297 --> 22:51.535
Somewhere other
than the one place
that I can't put anything.

22:53.672 --> 22:56.407
Freud, he did posit,

22:56.409 --> 23:00.311
Things that
we learn as children
never fully go away.

23:00.313 --> 23:01.879
Even things
that we know aren't true,

23:01.881 --> 23:05.649
There's a part of us
that still believes them.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.752
Hmm.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.720
Like my neighbor.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.122
Sid pomerantz.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.457
He was this
big-shot producer jane met

23:13.459 --> 23:15.893
A few months
after we'd been
in hollywood.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.495
He goes completely crazy
for her,

23:17.497 --> 23:18.996
Sending her
tiffany bracelets,

23:18.998 --> 23:20.831
Taking her
to fancy parties,

23:20.833 --> 23:21.932
Casting her.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.434
I'm either at home
unemployed

23:23.436 --> 23:26.070
Or babysitting
some director's
incontinent bulldog.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.173
All of a sudden,
jane's getting home
to our apartment

23:29.175 --> 23:30.574
Later and later
at night,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.376
Out painting
the town with...

23:32.378 --> 23:34.245
Mary dougherty.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.548
She was a sweet girl.
She lived up the block
from us.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.551
Mary got pregnant
at 14.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.219
She kept it to herself,

23:42.221 --> 23:44.555
Then she went into labor
a month early

23:44.557 --> 23:46.991
And bled to death
in her bedroom.

23:46.993 --> 23:47.491
Oh, how awful.

23:47.493 --> 23:51.362
My mother used to say,
"if you're a wicked girl,
god will punish you.

23:51.364 --> 23:53.931
"but if you're
a good girl, barbara,

23:53.933 --> 23:55.199
"and you wait
until marriage,

23:55.201 --> 23:58.269
"then god
will protect you."

24:00.038 --> 24:01.672
And then one day,
out of the blue,

24:01.674 --> 24:04.041
I woke up
with a figure, and...

24:04.643 --> 24:07.645
Boys started to give me
the time of day.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.680
I liked it.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.314
All that attention.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.049
But then any time
I would be with a boy,

24:12.051 --> 24:15.586
Mary dougherty
would pop into my head
and it'd be like...

24:15.588 --> 24:17.822
Like someone
flipped a switch.

24:17.824 --> 24:22.793
I just couldn't do
anything in the bedroom
with jane.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.497
Since then, I tried once
with another girl.

24:26.499 --> 24:30.701
Twice, sort of, but still.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.335
I'm sorry.

24:31.337 --> 24:34.104
This is
an inappropriate topic
to be bringing up at work.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.806
Not at...
Not at all, lester.

24:35.808 --> 24:39.643
We, uh, we talk
about these...

24:40.178 --> 24:42.813
...Sorts of things
every day.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.749
It's why
we ask about this
on our questionnaire,

24:45.751 --> 24:49.086
About someone's
first sexual experience.

24:49.088 --> 24:53.424
My brother paul
had a friend
who liked me.

24:53.426 --> 24:57.127
He wanted
to sleep with me,
but I...

24:57.129 --> 24:59.630
I didn't want
to get pregnant,

24:59.632 --> 25:02.733
So I used
my mouth instead.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.069
That's my first.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.774
It was a while after
that until I...

25:10.776 --> 25:14.211
...Realized that my opening
had shut completely.

25:14.213 --> 25:18.148
All that thinking
about mary dougherty,
I guess.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.854
What was his name?

25:23.856 --> 25:24.955
Your first.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.857
Paul's friend.

25:31.496 --> 25:32.763
(chuckles)

25:32.765 --> 25:34.398
I can't remember.

25:37.602 --> 25:38.869
Is that bad?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.437
No.

25:40.772 --> 25:41.272
No, it...

25:41.274 --> 25:43.274
It's just most people
can't forget the name

25:43.276 --> 25:44.808
Of their first partner.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.810
Even if they want to.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.947
(indistinct conversations)

25:59.691 --> 26:00.624
Hello.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.860
Looking for
fashion periodicals?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.628
Yes. Yes, I am.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.108
For heaven's sake!

26:18.110 --> 26:20.444
(tires screeching)

26:22.914 --> 26:24.048
(tires screeching)

26:24.050 --> 26:26.617
(woman screams in distance)

26:54.446 --> 26:58.716
Oh, honey.
You haven't
eaten anything.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.951
You can't let him
do that.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.586
I didn't notice.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.588
There's an article
in the afternoon edition

27:04.590 --> 27:06.490
About that man you saw.

27:07.592 --> 27:08.926
What does it say?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.462
Police found
an ounce of marijuana

27:11.464 --> 27:13.330
In the victim's jacket.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.600
They think it's some kind
of drug deal gone awry.

27:16.602 --> 27:20.738
So I wouldn't feel
too sorry for him
if I were you.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.073
They don't know
who did it?

27:23.075 --> 27:26.477
Still looking
for a suspect.

27:28.113 --> 27:32.416
Never should have
moved to that awful
neighborhood.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.318
Every area
has its problems.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.953
I don't remember
men fighting for drugs

27:35.955 --> 27:37.888
Outside of
washington university.

27:37.890 --> 27:41.458
Well, that's why
putting together a board
is so important.

27:41.460 --> 27:47.831
A reputable board
is an essential partner
in the raising of funds.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.934
With more cash on hand,

27:50.936 --> 27:51.935
We can move the office

27:51.937 --> 27:54.505
To a more
desirable location.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.439
Oh, speaking of cash,

27:55.441 --> 27:58.409
I spoke to glen ellis
this morning.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.777
He said you managed
to convince him

27:59.779 --> 28:03.247
To write a $50 check
for the veiled prophet.

28:04.482 --> 28:07.484
Told me
you're a natural salesman.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.024
Is that...

28:14.192 --> 28:16.860
Is that
something burning?

28:17.295 --> 28:19.530
The casserole.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.649
I feel like a teenager
smoking in the girls' room.

28:38.651 --> 28:39.516
Mmm-hmm.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.319
What did you say
his name was again?

28:42.321 --> 28:45.155
Francis h. Mason jr.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.793
He ever mention
a francis before?

28:49.795 --> 28:52.996
Rochester school
of medicine.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.632
Okay, so I snooped
through his file.

28:55.634 --> 28:56.900
Graduated 1947.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.570
Bill was class of '43.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.639
They must've been pals.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.241
Who even knew
the doc had friends?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.677
(chuckles)
he has never mentioned
any to me.

29:06.679 --> 29:10.914
Although, he has
been acting strangely
the past few days.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.384
And the man does like
to keep his secrets.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.456
Motility grade is...

29:19.458 --> 29:22.025
Is, uh, excellent.

29:22.527 --> 29:23.827
(clears throat)

29:23.829 --> 29:25.362
Uh...

29:25.797 --> 29:27.831
Morphology...

29:27.999 --> 29:28.799
Well above average.

29:28.801 --> 29:31.769
For christ's sake,
just tell me.

29:33.638 --> 29:35.072
Sperm count is low.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.808
Two million
per milliliter.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.042
(exhales deeply)

29:39.044 --> 29:40.043
Normal is...

29:40.045 --> 29:41.645
Ten times that.

29:41.980 --> 29:45.682
It's a random
genetic anomaly.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.651
Incredibly common.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.255
In fact, I, uh...

29:52.157 --> 29:56.426
Well, I... I see men
with this condition
every day.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.294
I can assure you,

29:57.296 --> 30:01.465
You and your wife
will be able to conceive.

30:03.268 --> 30:03.934
In a lab.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.869
Oh, I'd have thought,
being a plastic surgeon,

30:05.871 --> 30:08.338
You'd appreciate
more than most

30:08.340 --> 30:11.809
That nature
doesn't always have
to have the last word.

30:11.811 --> 30:15.112
In terms of treatment,
I spoke to howard graham

30:15.114 --> 30:16.914
At kansas city methodist
this morning.

30:16.916 --> 30:21.018
He feels quite confident
in taking it from here.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.453
(scoffs)

30:23.455 --> 30:25.088
Well, it hardly
makes sense for you,

30:25.090 --> 30:27.891
Uh, to upend
both your lives
for months on end

30:27.893 --> 30:30.360
Just to be treated
here in st. Louis.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.495
Why not?

30:31.497 --> 30:33.263
I'm due for
a sabbatical anyway.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.431
We could find
an apartment in the area...

30:34.433 --> 30:38.468
Howard graham is
one of the leading lights
in the country in fertility.

30:38.470 --> 30:42.105
You'll be in
very capable hands,
I can assure you.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.408
He's not our doctor, bill.

30:44.943 --> 30:46.577
You are.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.746
You can take
your results
to dr. Graham

30:49.748 --> 30:50.914
When you see him
tomorrow morning.

30:50.916 --> 30:54.418
I've scheduled
an appointment for you
and your wife for 9:00.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.287
I assumed
you'd be eager
to get started.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.722
Um, I'll keep up
with your case,

30:58.724 --> 31:01.225
Make sure
everything runs smoothly.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.694
You and I, uh...

31:03.995 --> 31:05.229
Well, we'll be
in touch.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.664
(breathes deeply)

31:10.235 --> 31:12.069
Like last time?

31:13.404 --> 31:15.339
Good luck, frank.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.177
(doorbell ringing)

31:20.179 --> 31:21.178
It's open!

31:21.180 --> 31:23.347
I wasn't
paying attention,
and I...

31:23.349 --> 31:23.947
And I...

31:23.949 --> 31:25.282
I put too much soap in...
(door closes)

31:25.284 --> 31:26.416
Because the whole thing
just exploded.

31:26.418 --> 31:30.053
Well, I can take
a look at it,
if you want.

31:31.289 --> 31:32.689
I'm sorry.
I thought...

31:32.691 --> 31:35.359
I thought you were
from sears.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.128
You want me to...

31:38.130 --> 31:40.664
No. No, thank you.

31:43.134 --> 31:46.169
Well, I'm here
because I saw you yesterday

31:46.171 --> 31:48.372
Drive by our building.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.072
Yes, my, um...

31:49.074 --> 31:51.341
My husband
works there now.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.210
And, uh, I was
only there,

31:53.212 --> 31:54.478
Um, raising money
for charity.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.780
Actually, for the
veiled prophet ball.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.215
It's, um...
It's an annual...

31:58.217 --> 31:59.149
Yeah, I...
I know what it is.

31:59.151 --> 32:03.020
It's, uh, one of
the oldest traditions
in st. Louis, actually.

32:03.521 --> 32:04.821
I never understood it
myself.

32:04.823 --> 32:07.124
All those privileged folks
paying a fortune

32:07.126 --> 32:09.826
To see a man
dressed up in robes
and a white hood.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.696
I mean, you can
drive a couple hours
south of here

32:12.698 --> 32:14.798
And see that for free.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.401
I'm very busy,
as you can see,

32:17.403 --> 32:19.937
So if there's something
that I can do for you...

32:19.939 --> 32:22.406
You saw what they did
to leonard.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.907
Leonard gilroy.

32:23.909 --> 32:27.844
He's the treasurer
of the st. Louis office
of core.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.514
Congress of
racial equality?

32:32.984 --> 32:36.753
He's the one
you saw laying
on the sidewalk.

32:38.656 --> 32:41.325
I did see that. Yes.

32:42.493 --> 32:43.760
It was very upsetting.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.464
Broke his nose, his arm,

32:47.466 --> 32:48.398
Cracked a couple of ribs,

32:48.400 --> 32:49.599
And left him outside
the core office

32:49.601 --> 32:52.035
For everyone to see
what they had done.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.403
Well, the newspaper
said that...

32:53.405 --> 32:58.241
Leonard gilroy
is a history teacher,
not a drug hustler.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.843
And how can they say
there was a fight

32:59.845 --> 33:01.812
When there
were people there
the whole time

33:01.814 --> 33:03.880
And no one saw
nothing like that?

33:03.882 --> 33:06.383
I was surprised
to read that, too.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.018
I... I had just come
out of the building,

33:08.020 --> 33:12.589
And, um, hadn't noticed
any sort of altercation.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.057
Look, we got
a couple of witnesses

33:14.059 --> 33:16.360
Who, uh, saw
a truck drive by

33:16.362 --> 33:17.728
And saw leonard
get dumped out the back,

33:17.730 --> 33:21.732
And one of them saw
the first three numbers
of the license plate.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.234
And, so,
I was wondering if...

33:24.236 --> 33:27.637
If maybe
you saw anything.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.306
If there are
other witnesses,

33:29.308 --> 33:31.808
Why are you
talking to me?

33:32.110 --> 33:35.245
Because most of them
are colored folks.

33:35.446 --> 33:38.148
The few white witnesses
won't talk,

33:38.150 --> 33:41.585
And the police
aren't about to start
an investigation

33:41.587 --> 33:44.888
Based on the testimony
of a bunch of negroes.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.158
So if you
did see something...

33:52.530 --> 33:54.398
I didn't.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.600
Sorry.

34:02.473 --> 34:03.540
Francis holden,

34:03.542 --> 34:06.109
Radiologist
from kansas city.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.945
That patient
you brought in
this morning,

34:08.947 --> 34:10.680
Francis mason?

34:10.682 --> 34:14.351
Plastic surgeon
from kansas city?

34:14.652 --> 34:18.355
You two went
to medical school
together, right?

34:19.991 --> 34:22.893
We went
to the same school, yes.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.728
And were you close?

34:25.129 --> 34:28.799
We had
a complicated relationship.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.634
In what way?

34:31.002 --> 34:35.372
Things didn't end well
between us.

34:35.374 --> 34:38.041
Or I... I...
I don't know.

34:39.377 --> 34:40.944
We drifted apart.

34:41.979 --> 34:44.848
Sent letters
for a while,
every year,

34:44.850 --> 34:46.850
Then every two.

34:48.119 --> 34:50.587
Then not at all.

34:51.756 --> 34:55.759
Well, he must
have made some kind
of impression on you,

34:55.761 --> 34:59.062
Considering you
named yourself after him.

34:59.363 --> 35:01.465
It's a coincidence.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.532
The universe
is full of coincidences.

35:02.534 --> 35:06.603
Thomas jefferson
and john adams died
within hours of each other

35:06.605 --> 35:09.005
Exactly 50 years
to the day

35:09.007 --> 35:11.608
From the signing of the
declaration of independence.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.610
Right.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.185
Are you going
to join me?

35:23.087 --> 35:27.757
I should have stopped
after I had my third drink
downstairs.

35:28.726 --> 35:30.961
I may have overdone it.

35:31.529 --> 35:33.830
I'm not sure I'd be of...

35:33.832 --> 35:35.866
Uh, much use.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.437
Well, we could try.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.606
A man can tell.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.276
(knocking on door)

35:48.880 --> 35:51.581
You order something
from downstairs?

35:54.352 --> 35:56.553
I'm sorry
to disturb you, dr. Holden,

35:56.555 --> 35:58.321
But you're on call tonight.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.123
Something the matter?

36:00.125 --> 36:01.958
You could say that.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.231
William: He's been dead
for hours.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.601
You need a coroner,
not an obstetrician.

36:12.203 --> 36:14.171
He ate himself to death?

36:14.173 --> 36:16.006
Either the lining
of his stomach burst,

36:16.008 --> 36:18.508
Or he suffered
cardiac arrest.

36:18.510 --> 36:24.181
Hard to say,
based on his,
uh, presentation.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.985
Well, maybe
he's better off.

36:28.987 --> 36:33.557
Whatever demons
this man was battling with,

36:33.559 --> 36:36.693
Clearly,
they were considerable.

36:36.695 --> 36:40.096
They can't harm him
anymore, can they?

36:40.198 --> 36:42.699
(doorbell ringing)

36:43.167 --> 36:45.902
Barbara:
I know, I know. I just...

36:46.070 --> 36:47.237
I needed to talk to you.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.472
And then
I saw your address
in the phone book.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.608
I realized you were
just a short drive.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.842
There are boundaries.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.077
You cannot just
show up at my home

36:54.079 --> 36:55.478
In the middle
of the night.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.279
You came looking for me!

36:56.281 --> 37:00.183
You came to my building.
You started talking to me.

37:00.185 --> 37:01.251
And after all of that

37:01.253 --> 37:03.553
And letting me
pour my heart
out to you,

37:03.555 --> 37:05.188
Now you want
to talk to me
about boundaries?

37:05.190 --> 37:08.091
Barbara, my children
are sleeping upstairs.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.259
I'm sorry.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.728
I just... I can't stop...

37:12.230 --> 37:15.165
Thinking about
what you said.

37:17.702 --> 37:21.204
I went home,
and I took out
all the old photo albums

37:21.206 --> 37:22.005
Back from
when I was a kid.

37:22.007 --> 37:26.876
And I thought
if I could just find
a picture of that boy,

37:26.878 --> 37:28.378
If I could just put a...

37:28.380 --> 37:29.012
A face with the name,

37:29.014 --> 37:33.683
That I would be
sure to remember it
straightaway.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.218
(voice breaking)
and I did.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.153
I remembered his name.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.522
(sniffles)

37:41.392 --> 37:42.826
Paul.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.262
But wasn't
your brother...

37:47.865 --> 37:50.834
We had this creek
that ran behind our house,

37:50.836 --> 37:53.870
And paul and I spent...

37:53.971 --> 37:55.705
(sobs)

37:55.707 --> 37:57.974
Practically
every afternoon there.

37:57.976 --> 38:02.345
We'd catch frogs
and have them race.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.414
Silly things like that.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.483
And then we got older.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.055
And we made up new games.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.358
Like...

38:16.327 --> 38:17.594
You have
to close your eyes

38:17.596 --> 38:23.099
And then just
hug each other
as tightly as you can,

38:23.101 --> 38:27.470
Or kiss for 20 seconds
with your mouth open.

38:27.772 --> 38:31.274
And then one day,
paul asked me
if he could put...

38:35.246 --> 38:37.113
Just to try it.

38:37.281 --> 38:41.985
And paul said
that if we were careful,
we wouldn't make a baby.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.688
And so we continued.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.956
And then one day,
we were late for supper,

38:46.958 --> 38:49.693
And my mom
came to find us.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.596
And when she saw us there,
she just...

38:54.065 --> 38:57.233
Didn't say anything
for the longest time.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.670
She just stood there,

39:00.672 --> 39:03.840
And she stared at us
with this...

39:05.109 --> 39:06.376
This look on her face.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.245
Not angry, just...

39:15.319 --> 39:17.087
Sickened.

39:18.356 --> 39:22.025
And then she turned around
and she walked home.

39:23.327 --> 39:25.061
That was it.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.162
She didn't say anything.

39:26.164 --> 39:29.766
She never brought it up,
but she didn't have to.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.870
Because god saw
what we did.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.973
(voice breaking)
god knew
what we had done,

39:36.975 --> 39:38.975
And that is why
he did this to me.

39:38.977 --> 39:42.379
He closed me up
because of what we did...

39:43.481 --> 39:45.915
Because we sickened him.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.761
Having a patient
in your home...

39:57.763 --> 39:59.162
I didn't know
what else to do.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.798
Once that kind
of professional boundary
has been crossed,

40:01.800 --> 40:04.734
You can't simply
snap your fingers
and undo it.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.937
I... I see
no other option here
besides a clean break.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.607
No. No.
I provoked those memories.

40:10.609 --> 40:14.677
I can't just
end it like that.
That would be cruel.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.845
She needs help, bill.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.681
She's not eating
or sleeping.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.351
She has nowhere else
to go.

40:24.321 --> 40:27.757
All right, we bring her
in as a patient...
Our patient.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.626
No more
individual meetings.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.562
We see her together,
in the office,

40:32.564 --> 40:35.031
In a controlled environment.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.135
In terms of treatment,

40:39.137 --> 40:43.706
Obviously,
there is significant
psychological trauma

40:43.708 --> 40:45.074
Underlying
the physical symptoms.

40:45.076 --> 40:46.075
Neither of us
is equipped

40:46.077 --> 40:48.745
To be delving
into this woman's
psychology.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.014
I know that.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.655
I would like
to become equipped.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.591
You know that I've wanted
to go back to school.

41:01.959 --> 41:02.625
What?

41:02.627 --> 41:05.495
As a practicing
psychologist?

41:06.263 --> 41:10.300
Virginia, first of all,
you'd have to complete
an undergraduate degree.

41:10.302 --> 41:11.868
That's four years
of coursework.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.437
There is
an accelerated program.
I've looked into it.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.673
And at least
three more years
of graduate studies,

41:16.675 --> 41:19.175
Not to mention
hundreds of hours
of clinical practice

41:19.177 --> 41:21.244
Before you can even begin
the accreditation process.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.948
It's important to me, bill,
going back to school.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.082
You know that it is.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.317
And I fully support it.

41:27.319 --> 41:29.886
I'm just wondering,
how does years of study

41:29.888 --> 41:33.022
Help barbara
in the short term?

41:33.524 --> 41:36.526
All right, then.
In the meantime...

41:36.528 --> 41:39.696
Who is the
best psychologist
in st. Louis?

41:39.698 --> 41:40.497
Lloyd madden, maybe?

41:40.499 --> 41:42.832
He chairs the program at
the university of missouri.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.033
Well, then,
let's call him

41:44.035 --> 41:45.068
And give him the basics
of barbara's case,

41:45.070 --> 41:46.636
See what advice
he has to offer.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.371
No reputable physician
would consent

41:48.373 --> 41:50.039
To giving
a medical opinion

41:50.041 --> 41:51.441
On a patient
they haven't met.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.142
And with us
as intermediaries,

41:53.144 --> 41:54.978
Passing on
secondhand advice...

41:54.980 --> 41:56.479
What do you suggest, then?

41:56.481 --> 41:58.081
Stick to what we know.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.550
The focus of this study
has always been

42:00.552 --> 42:02.452
The physiology
of the human body.

42:02.454 --> 42:04.420
I see no reason
to change course now,

42:04.422 --> 42:06.222
Just because
we're attempting to cure

42:06.224 --> 42:08.725
As opposed
to simply observe.

42:12.463 --> 42:15.698
Woman: Okay, salesladies,
let's take our seats.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.768
The presentation
is about to begin.

42:19.737 --> 42:22.505
(indistinct conversations)

42:29.480 --> 42:32.081
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.350
Nervous about
your big day?

42:34.352 --> 42:35.418
My spokesman croaked.

42:35.420 --> 42:39.756
Had to drive out
to some hotel in alton,
identify the body.

42:39.924 --> 42:41.824
Heart attack?
Cheesecake.

42:41.826 --> 42:45.528
Turns out
there was a reason
he never made it past radio.

42:45.530 --> 42:47.130
It's a blessing
in disguise.

42:47.132 --> 42:50.633
What kind of
diet company has
a 300-pound spokesman?

42:50.635 --> 42:52.802
Plus, it pushed me
to do something

42:52.804 --> 42:54.671
I've been thinking about
for days.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.773
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:56.941 --> 42:57.907
Ladies?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.175
Ladies, please be quiet.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.710
Ladies.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.647
It is with
a heavy heart

43:04.649 --> 43:05.582
That I announce
to you today

43:05.584 --> 43:09.786
That kent underleigh,
our beloved spokesman,

43:09.788 --> 43:12.956
Has passed beyond
this earthly veil.

43:12.958 --> 43:13.723
(all exclaiming)

43:13.725 --> 43:16.693
Now, ladies,
even in this dark moment,

43:16.695 --> 43:18.361
We must remember...

43:18.363 --> 43:22.632
Every end
is a new beginning.

43:22.634 --> 43:23.566
That's why I'm delighted

43:23.568 --> 43:27.904
To introduce
our new spokesman
for cal-o-metric.

43:28.739 --> 43:29.706
With no further ado,

43:29.708 --> 43:32.141
Let's give
a big cal-o-metric welcome

43:32.143 --> 43:35.612
To the new face
of women's nutrition...

43:35.614 --> 43:38.381
Dr. Austin langham!

43:38.383 --> 43:39.415
(all applauding)

43:39.417 --> 43:41.284
Thank you!
Thank you.

43:41.286 --> 43:41.718
Stop.

43:41.720 --> 43:43.820
You're embarrassing me.
Please.

43:46.423 --> 43:47.890
Thank you very much.

43:47.892 --> 43:50.627
<i>Possible somatic</i>
<i>causes of impotence</i>

43:50.629 --> 43:54.564
<i>May include</i>
<i>vascular disease,</i>

43:54.566 --> 43:56.666
<i>Hyperthyroid,</i>

43:57.635 --> 43:58.468
<i>Diabetes,</i>

43:58.470 --> 44:02.839
<i>Or other</i>
<i>endocrinological conditions.</i>

44:05.042 --> 44:06.709
We've been going
for an hour.

44:06.711 --> 44:08.478
Should we take a break?

44:08.646 --> 44:12.782
Uh, let's, uh,
keep rolling, actually.

44:15.219 --> 44:16.986
<i>Take a seat.</i>

44:21.892 --> 44:24.193
I realized that, uh...

44:24.762 --> 44:29.065
After all this time
of you filming us,

44:29.233 --> 44:30.166
You haven't had a chance

44:30.168 --> 44:35.705
To discuss your own role
in the study.

44:39.209 --> 44:40.877
Oh, uh...

44:41.679 --> 44:43.846
<i>I'm... I'm documenting it.</i>

44:43.848 --> 44:46.315
<i>I'm archiving it, really.</i>

44:46.817 --> 44:48.718
<i>I guess.</i>

44:49.353 --> 44:50.753
<i>In your work, um,</i>

44:50.755 --> 44:55.658
<i>What would you say</i>
<i>has been your most</i>
<i>important inspiration?</i>

44:55.660 --> 44:57.560
<i>The study.</i>

44:59.530 --> 45:00.363
I mean, in hollywood...

45:00.365 --> 45:02.398
And I know
because I've been there...

45:02.400 --> 45:04.200
They just churn out
the same old stories...

45:04.202 --> 45:07.236
The western
about the outlaw
with a heart of gold

45:07.238 --> 45:09.205
Or the monster movie
about the scientist

45:09.207 --> 45:11.774
That no one will listen to
until it's too late.

45:11.776 --> 45:12.875
(chuckles)

45:12.877 --> 45:16.112
But here, in this lab,

45:16.246 --> 45:19.515
What you do every day,

45:19.717 --> 45:21.951
It's all brand-new.

45:24.288 --> 45:24.887
And what we do here

45:24.889 --> 45:28.191
Is not just
about observation
and discovery, though.

45:28.193 --> 45:29.759
What good is a theory,
after all,

45:29.761 --> 45:32.328
If you can't do anything
with it?

45:32.330 --> 45:35.865
The work we're doing here,
it's changing.

45:35.867 --> 45:41.237
We're no longer simply
observing phenomena
and compiling data.

45:41.239 --> 45:45.675
We're beginning
to explore the idea
of intervention...

45:46.210 --> 45:49.579
Working directly
with patients.

45:49.581 --> 45:54.717
<i>Our new mission here</i>
<i>is not simply to observe.</i>

45:55.686 --> 45:57.687
<i>It's also to heal.</i>

46:00.791 --> 46:03.092
(indistinct conversations)

46:03.094 --> 46:05.895
(big-band music plays)

46:06.296 --> 46:09.031
Libby:
The gown, the gloves,
the dancing lessons...

46:09.033 --> 46:10.433
The... The whole thing
cost a fortune.

46:10.435 --> 46:14.003
So I was
the only one in my class
who wasn't a debutante.

46:14.005 --> 46:14.804
Well, in spite of that,

46:14.806 --> 46:16.639
I would say
you debuted quite well.

46:16.641 --> 46:18.875
Now, where is
that waiter?

46:21.311 --> 46:24.080
Uh, the lady
will have a gin and tonic.

46:24.082 --> 46:24.580
Thank you.

46:24.582 --> 46:27.650
Jim: Bill masters,
how the hell are you?

46:27.652 --> 46:28.251
Dr. Pearson.

46:28.253 --> 46:29.519
Allow me
to introduce you to...

46:29.521 --> 46:30.653
Mrs. Masters,
what a pleasure.

46:30.655 --> 46:33.222
No, actually,
this is mrs. Masters.

46:33.224 --> 46:35.324
And mrs. Johnson
works with bill,

46:35.326 --> 46:37.560
Which is like
being married.

46:37.562 --> 46:39.395
Yes, only the hours
are worse.

46:39.397 --> 46:41.130
(both chuckle)

46:41.532 --> 46:42.899
There you two are.

46:42.901 --> 46:45.601
Hello.
Look who else is here...

46:45.603 --> 46:49.071
The king and his court
have arrived.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.840
From the court of honor,

46:50.842 --> 46:51.941
The queen of love
and beauty

46:51.943 --> 46:56.212
Is crowned
by the veiled prophet
of khorassan.

46:56.814 --> 47:00.216
It certainly is
a fascinating tradition.

47:00.218 --> 47:02.919
It's been going
since 1878.

47:03.120 --> 47:05.188
Damn strange tradition
is what it is.

47:05.190 --> 47:07.557
But at least the liquor's
always first-class.

47:07.559 --> 47:11.127
You behave yourself,
sam duncan.

47:11.495 --> 47:12.461
A toast

47:12.463 --> 47:13.596
To libby masters,

47:13.598 --> 47:16.199
True christian saint
if there ever was one.

47:16.201 --> 47:18.968
Libby raised $300
in one week.

47:18.970 --> 47:20.336
Oh, it was nothing,
really.

47:20.338 --> 47:21.604
Hear, hear.
Sam: Cheers.

47:21.606 --> 47:23.005
And have you given
any more thought

47:23.007 --> 47:25.508
To our proposal,
chief duncan?

47:26.043 --> 47:29.645
I have a feeling
this study of yours
is political poison.

47:29.647 --> 47:33.015
Well, but then again,
you're not a politician,
are you?

47:33.017 --> 47:33.649
In fact, we're the...

47:33.651 --> 47:36.285
The opposite
of political men.

47:36.287 --> 47:37.653
Thank god for it.

47:37.655 --> 47:38.855
So...

47:38.857 --> 47:40.690
I suppose I'm in.

47:45.762 --> 47:47.563
Shall we head in?

47:51.134 --> 47:53.069
Oh, um, just...

47:53.904 --> 47:56.072
(camera shutter clicks)

47:57.774 --> 47:59.709
There you are, sir.

48:01.011 --> 48:03.145
(camera shutter clicks)
excellent.

48:16.827 --> 48:20.196
Robert franklin
came to the house
yesterday.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.266
Coral's brother.

48:23.667 --> 48:25.668
What did he want?

48:25.670 --> 48:26.903
He said the story
in the newspaper

48:26.905 --> 48:30.273
About that man
in front of your office
isn't true.

48:30.275 --> 48:31.207
There are witnesses,
he said,

48:31.209 --> 48:33.976
Who saw the man
being thrown out
of a truck.

48:34.211 --> 48:36.779
And what has that
got to do with you?

48:37.147 --> 48:39.048
I saw the truck.

48:39.050 --> 48:40.650
It almost drove
right into me.

48:40.652 --> 48:44.553
He asked me
to go to the police,
to tell them what I saw.

48:46.456 --> 48:48.758
This is not our issue, lib.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.459
"our" issue?

48:50.961 --> 48:53.129
This isn't our issue.

48:54.031 --> 48:57.133
The only reason
I volunteered
to raise money

48:57.135 --> 49:00.202
Was to convince sam
to join the board.

49:00.204 --> 49:01.070
And I appreciate it.

49:01.072 --> 49:03.439
I know you do.
It's just...

49:04.441 --> 49:06.242
Everything in
our lives, bill,

49:06.244 --> 49:07.476
For as long
as I can remember,

49:07.478 --> 49:09.679
Has been
about the study.

49:09.681 --> 49:10.913
I mean,
loans we've taken out

49:10.915 --> 49:13.482
And friendships
that we've lost,

49:13.484 --> 49:15.017
And it's all been
for your work,

49:15.019 --> 49:17.687
Work that does not
include me.

49:18.755 --> 49:21.557
I just... I...
I don't know...

49:22.025 --> 49:22.591
(sighs)

49:22.593 --> 49:25.962
I don't know
where I fit in with it all.

49:27.431 --> 49:29.465
You're with me.

49:43.847 --> 49:46.415
Uh, frank just called.

49:46.417 --> 49:50.486
Said he'll meet you
tonight at the coffee shop
at 9:00.

49:55.559 --> 49:58.494
Virginia: Dr. Madden
is expecting you at 7:00.

49:58.496 --> 50:02.131
I figured it would be
easiest for you
to see him after work.

50:02.133 --> 50:03.566
You made me
an appointment?

50:03.568 --> 50:06.902
Dr. Madden is an expert
in this area.

50:06.904 --> 50:07.503
He can help you.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.905
You can discuss
the problems that
you've been having.

50:09.907 --> 50:11.474
I thought that
you were helping me.

50:11.476 --> 50:15.611
Yes, but I don't
have anywhere near
the qualifications...

50:15.613 --> 50:19.682
You cannot expect me
to sit down with
a complete stranger.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.784
A... A man, no less

50:21.786 --> 50:24.487
And tell him the things
that I have told you.

50:24.489 --> 50:26.288
No, I'm...
I'm sorry, virginia.

50:26.290 --> 50:27.857
I'm sorry, but I can't.

50:27.859 --> 50:29.625
I'm sorry.

50:29.627 --> 50:31.093
(sighs)

50:54.785 --> 50:57.019
(door opens)

50:59.322 --> 51:01.390
I'd like
to speak to you,

51:01.392 --> 51:04.460
About what I saw
the other day.

51:08.799 --> 51:09.465
I can't live like this.

51:09.467 --> 51:14.203
I'm...
I've lost my appetite.
I haven't slept in days.

51:14.404 --> 51:16.705
And why do you think
that is?

51:16.807 --> 51:20.576
Something happened to me
a very long time ago.

51:20.578 --> 51:23.245
And, somehow...

51:23.247 --> 51:26.449
Well, it's...
It's come up again.

51:30.153 --> 51:30.886
When I grew up,

51:30.888 --> 51:34.156
There was a creek
that ran behind my house.

51:34.158 --> 51:35.658
And in the summers,
my brother and I,

51:35.660 --> 51:38.360
We would spend
every day down there,

51:38.362 --> 51:40.096
Chasing frogs

51:40.098 --> 51:44.366
And holding our breaths
under water.

51:44.468 --> 51:46.836
And then, eventually,

51:46.838 --> 51:51.273
As we got older,
the games...

51:51.275 --> 51:53.342
They changed.

52:08.692 --> 52:11.227
I thought
you were going home.

52:11.229 --> 52:12.495
We were.

52:12.497 --> 52:15.698
We discussed it, though,
and we decided

52:15.700 --> 52:18.634
We didn't want anyone else
doing the treatments.

52:18.636 --> 52:19.502
We've made arrangements.

52:19.504 --> 52:22.938
Pauline found a hotel
that accommodates
long-term stays...

52:22.940 --> 52:25.207
This was not the agreement.

52:26.309 --> 52:28.544
I didn't agree
to anything.

52:35.385 --> 52:36.785
My first week
as a resident,

52:36.787 --> 52:41.223
They had me on
the emergency-medicine
rotation.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.259
About 2:00 in the morning
one night,

52:43.261 --> 52:46.162
They bring in
this young girl,
automobile accident.

52:46.164 --> 52:51.100
She'd lost control,
swerved off an embankment
into a ditch.

52:51.102 --> 52:52.535
Went right through
the glass,

52:52.537 --> 52:57.740
Skidded across asphalt
and gravel for 30, 40 feet.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.208
Her face...

52:59.210 --> 53:03.045
I'm sure you can imagine.
It was just...

53:04.614 --> 53:08.684
They called in
a plastic surgeon
from new york city.

53:08.686 --> 53:11.954
I watched him work
on that girl for hours.

53:12.322 --> 53:14.757
When he was finished,

53:14.759 --> 53:18.761
She walked out
of that hospital
with a brand-new face.

53:19.262 --> 53:21.163
The next morning,

53:21.165 --> 53:23.499
I switched my specialty
to plastic surgery.

53:23.501 --> 53:25.935
I thought,
"what could be better

53:25.937 --> 53:30.172
"than being able
to give somebody
a second chance?"

53:31.975 --> 53:34.910
The embankment
she swerved off?

53:34.978 --> 53:37.079
It wasn't an accident.

53:37.681 --> 53:40.916
All we'd done
was ruin her plans.

53:42.552 --> 53:45.020
Six months later,
she corrected the mistake...

53:45.022 --> 53:49.258
Took a fistful
of sleeping pills.

53:51.795 --> 53:55.331
You think it's enough
to fix the outside.

53:57.801 --> 53:59.668
That's the easy part.

54:07.043 --> 54:09.511
I have to tell you, bill...

54:11.748 --> 54:15.384
I've spent most of my life
pretending you don't exist.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.053
When people would ask me,

54:18.055 --> 54:20.155
I'd tell them
I was an only child.

54:20.157 --> 54:22.992
"my parents
only wanted one."

54:23.126 --> 54:26.562
At some point,
I'd said it so long,

54:26.630 --> 54:29.999
I started half-believing it
myself.

54:44.848 --> 54:47.316
I want my brother back.
