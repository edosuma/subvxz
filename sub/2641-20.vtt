WEBVTT

00:02.099 --> 00:05.568
Oh, damn, they canceled my Visa.

00:05.569 --> 00:09.337
Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!

00:09.338 --> 00:11.506
Uh-oh.

00:11.507 --> 00:12.640
What?

00:12.641 --> 00:14.542
I was going to get my mail.

00:14.543 --> 00:16.343
Okay.

00:18.012 --> 00:21.481
Are... are you hoping to
get it telepathically?

00:21.482 --> 00:24.336
I think you mean telekinetically.

00:25.072 --> 00:26.177
And no.

00:26.178 --> 00:27.458
I just wasn't sure

00:27.459 --> 00:29.766
of the proper protocol
now that you and Leonard

00:29.767 --> 00:31.695
are no longer having coitus.

00:31.696 --> 00:35.214
God, can we please just say
"no longer seeing each other"?

00:35.215 --> 00:36.732
Well, we could if it were true.

00:36.733 --> 00:38.644
But as you live in
the same building,

00:38.645 --> 00:40.166
you see each other all the time.

00:40.167 --> 00:43.495
The variable which has
changed is the coitus.

00:43.496 --> 00:46.251
Okay, here's the protocol:

00:46.252 --> 00:48.854
you and I are still friends,
and you stop saying "coitus."

00:49.172 --> 00:50.588
Good, good.

00:50.589 --> 00:52.553
I'm glad we're still friends.

00:52.554 --> 00:53.502
Really?

00:53.503 --> 00:55.398
Oh, yes. It was a lot of work

00:55.399 --> 00:56.846
to accommodate you in my life.

00:56.847 --> 01:00.201
I'd hate for that effort
to have been in vain.

01:00.202 --> 01:01.548
Right.

01:01.549 --> 01:04.007
Just to be clear, do I have to stop

01:04.009 --> 01:06.178
saying "coitus" with
everyone or just you?

01:06.914 --> 01:09.081
Everyone.

01:09.082 --> 01:10.594
Harsh terms.

01:10.595 --> 01:13.016
But all right-- I'll just
substitute "intercourse."

01:13.017 --> 01:14.205
Great.

01:14.206 --> 01:15.582
Or "fornication."

01:15.583 --> 01:17.704
Yeah. But that has
judgmental overtones,

01:17.705 --> 01:19.858
so I'll hold that in reserve.

01:19.859 --> 01:22.044
So, how you been?

01:22.045 --> 01:24.340
Well, my existence is a continuum,

01:24.575 --> 01:28.187
so I've been what I am at each
point in the implied time period.

01:31.038 --> 01:34.063
You're just coitusing with me,
aren't you?

01:36.315 --> 01:38.564
Bazinga. Mm-hmm.

01:39.481 --> 01:40.722
How's Leonard doing?

01:40.723 --> 01:42.164
He seems all right.

01:42.165 --> 01:44.853
Although he does spend a
disturbing amount of time

01:44.854 --> 01:46.535
looking at photographs of you

01:46.536 --> 01:49.925
and smelling the
pillow you slept on.

01:49.926 --> 01:51.405
Oh, but now that I think of it,

01:51.406 --> 01:54.527
he asked me not to tell you that.

01:54.528 --> 01:56.808
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

01:56.809 --> 02:00.769
I'd rather you pretend
I didn't say it.

02:00.770 --> 02:04.663
I see you bought Mama Italia
marinara spaghetti sauce.

02:04.664 --> 02:06.237
Yep.

02:06.238 --> 02:08.457
That's the sauce my mother uses.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.770
She likes cooking Italian
because according to her,

02:10.770 --> 02:14.456
that's what the
Romans made Jesus eat.

02:14.457 --> 02:15.796
Interesting.

02:15.797 --> 02:18.409
I'll have to have you over
for spaghetti some night.

02:18.410 --> 02:19.920
I'm hungry now.

02:19.921 --> 02:21.998
Oh. Um, okay.

02:21.999 --> 02:24.815
Why don't you give me
an hour and come over?

02:24.816 --> 02:26.960
Will you cut up hot
dogs into little chunks

02:26.961 --> 02:28.538
and mix them in with the sauce?

02:28.539 --> 02:31.083
I don't have hot dogs.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.593
Oh, it's all right; I do.

02:32.594 --> 02:36.948
Oh! You're in for what my mother
calls "a real Eye-talian treat""

02:39.998 --> 02:41.069
Hey, where you been?

02:41.070 --> 02:43.213
I was talking with Penny.

02:43.214 --> 02:45.023
What's wrong with you?

02:45.024 --> 02:47.133
You can't hang out with
your roommate's ex.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.643
That's totally uncool.

02:48.644 --> 02:50.719
No, it's fine. I don't care.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.425
I'm over it.

02:52.426 --> 02:54.905
Yeah, he's over it;
that's why he's been whining all day

02:54.906 --> 02:56.748
about trying to invent
that memory-wiper gizmo

02:56.749 --> 02:58.454
from <i>Men in Black.</i>

02:58.455 --> 03:00.430
Is he making any progress?

03:00.431 --> 03:04.082
Because I'd like to erase
Ben Affleck as Daredevil.

03:06.997 --> 03:09.172
So would Ben Affleck.

03:09.173 --> 03:11.581
The point is,
in a situation like this

03:11.582 --> 03:13.457
you got to pick sides.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.936
You're either on Team
Leonard or Team Penny.

03:15.937 --> 03:18.379
Which one picks last?

03:18.380 --> 03:19.920
What?

03:19.921 --> 03:22.396
Well, usually I'm on the
team that picks last.

03:23.434 --> 03:26.179
Unless there's a kid
in a wheelchair.

03:28.489 --> 03:30.663
Sheldon, I got you
your tangerine chicken.

03:30.664 --> 03:32.104
I hope you're hungry.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.150
Well, of course I'm hungry.

03:35.151 --> 03:38.429
And as I have no plans to
eat with any other team,

03:38.430 --> 03:40.403
I will consume my tangerine chicken

03:40.404 --> 03:42.311
with the appropriate gusto.

03:42.312 --> 03:43.616
Mm, mm, mm!

03:46.261 --> 03:47.532
Okay.

03:47.533 --> 03:50.344
Just out of curiosity,
do we still have hot dogs?

03:50.345 --> 03:52.252
I don't know. Why?

03:52.253 --> 03:54.660
Just making dinner conversation.

03:54.661 --> 03:57.538

04:23.093 --> 04:24.862
Oh, God, this is good.

04:24.863 --> 04:26.529
Let me ask you a question.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.431
Do you believe you're
going to go to hell

04:28.432 --> 04:30.666
for eating sweet and sour pork?

04:30.667 --> 04:33.202
Jews don't have hell.

04:33.203 --> 04:36.471
We have acid reflux.

04:36.472 --> 04:39.274
Do you want the last
dumpling, Sheldon?

04:39.275 --> 04:40.575
Certainly.

04:40.576 --> 04:43.110
It's not like I have to
moderate my food intake

04:43.111 --> 04:45.745
because I'm planning on
eating again very shortly.

04:45.746 --> 04:47.613
Mm, mm, mm!

04:51.283 --> 04:54.018
So, you guys want to
do something tonight?

04:54.019 --> 04:55.287
Nah, I can't.

04:55.288 --> 04:57.623
I got to pick up my mom from
her water aerobics class.

04:57.624 --> 05:02.293
18 overweight women
flapping their arm fat

05:02.294 --> 05:04.495
in a swimming pool.

05:05.698 --> 05:09.767
Looks like the manatee
tank at Sea World.

05:11.002 --> 05:12.536
What about you, Raj?

05:12.537 --> 05:13.870
Oh, there it is:

05:13.871 --> 05:15.304
now that you don't
have a girlfriend,

05:15.305 --> 05:17.273
you want to hang out with me again.

05:17.274 --> 05:19.775
I never stopped hanging
out with you. Oh, please,

05:19.776 --> 05:21.276
we all know I'm the friend you call

05:21.277 --> 05:22.944
when you have no other options.

05:22.945 --> 05:26.614
If we were the Justice League,
I'd be Aquaman.

05:26.615 --> 05:28.081
I <i>wish</i> you were Aquaman.

05:28.082 --> 05:31.784
Then I could send you to scoop
my mom out of the old lady tank.

05:33.420 --> 05:37.389
Excuse me, I'm thirsty,
so I'm going to go to the refrigerator

05:37.390 --> 05:40.224
and get myself a
refreshing beverage.

05:41.493 --> 05:44.996
You know what? I'll just
spend the evening alone.

05:44.997 --> 05:48.999
What, suddenly I'm not
good enough for you?

05:54.670 --> 05:56.371
Ah...

05:57.339 --> 05:59.307
I do so love beverages.

05:59.308 --> 06:03.243
Now I think I'll take
my after-dinner walk.

06:06.447 --> 06:09.015
Since when do you take
after-dinner walks?

06:09.016 --> 06:11.117
Yeah, since when do you take walks?

06:11.118 --> 06:13.919
I read a study online
that walking after a meal

06:13.920 --> 06:16.721
not only aids in digestion,
but increases serotonin,

06:16.722 --> 06:19.456
and you know me,
if there's one thing I like

06:19.457 --> 06:22.227
more than a refreshing beverage,
it's serotonin. Bye-bye.

06:22.228 --> 06:24.531
Hold on. I'll walk down with you.

06:24.532 --> 06:25.599
Oh...

06:25.600 --> 06:27.432
that's not necessary.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.767
You can go first.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.168
Or we could go together.

06:31.169 --> 06:35.071
I can't think of a reason why not.

06:35.072 --> 06:36.172
Let's go.

06:36.173 --> 06:37.639
Hold on.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.808
Nope, no reason.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:48.552 --> 06:50.721
I've missed you.

06:52.991 --> 06:55.958
All right, say hello
to your mother for me.

06:55.959 --> 06:58.226
Okay.

07:01.898 --> 07:03.832
What?

07:03.833 --> 07:06.600
You said you were going for a walk.

07:06.601 --> 07:09.302
I didn't say outside.

07:09.303 --> 07:13.439
So what, you're just gonna
walk up and down the stairs?

07:13.440 --> 07:16.008
No, of course not.

07:16.009 --> 07:18.878
That would be odd and
suspicious behavior.

07:19.713 --> 07:21.880
Here, Russell! Here, boy!

07:21.881 --> 07:23.347
Which way are you going?

07:23.348 --> 07:24.849
Which way are <i>you</i> going?

07:24.850 --> 07:27.317
I parked my scooter down the block.

07:27.318 --> 07:30.286
I'm going the other way. Bye.

07:30.287 --> 07:31.787
Bye.

07:32.656 --> 07:34.824
Actually, I'm this way.

07:36.493 --> 07:37.960
Do I smell hot dogs?

07:37.961 --> 07:40.895
No. I mean, I have no
idea what you smell.

07:41.696 --> 07:43.930
I definitely smell raw hot dog.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.233
Perhaps you're getting
a brain tumor.

07:47.469 --> 07:49.537
All right, have a nice walk.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.905
I shall. Have a nice scoot.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.874
You might want to stand back.

07:55.875 --> 07:59.276
I'm sitting on top
of 13 horses here.

08:10.087 --> 08:11.820
Oh. Hello, doggie.

08:11.821 --> 08:13.488
Nice doggie.

08:15.156 --> 08:18.291
I bet you think you smell hot dogs.

08:19.126 --> 08:20.960
Look, a cat!

08:25.532 --> 08:27.800
SHELDON Penny?

08:28.535 --> 08:30.802
Penny.

08:35.273 --> 08:37.274
Penny.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.609
Here.

08:41.378 --> 08:44.647
I had to trade the
others for my life.

08:50.345 --> 08:51.679
Hey, Leonard?

08:51.680 --> 08:52.980
Yeah?

08:52.981 --> 08:55.349
I haven't had sex in a year.

08:57.985 --> 09:00.653
Where you going with this, Raj?

09:01.755 --> 09:03.622
Don't flatter yourself, dude.

09:05.291 --> 09:06.925
I want to go out and meet a woman.

09:06.926 --> 09:08.626
So, go. Well, I need a wingman.

09:08.627 --> 09:11.995
I don't want to come off
like a lonely loser.

09:11.996 --> 09:15.498
And you think <i>my</i> presence
will help with that?

09:15.499 --> 09:16.799
Well, I do.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.502
Next to you,
I'll look like a catch.

09:19.503 --> 09:22.071
I'm not going out tonight, Raj.

09:22.072 --> 09:23.672
All right.

09:23.673 --> 09:25.206
Would you mind if I
went to your room

09:25.207 --> 09:28.309
and downloaded some
Asian pornography?

09:28.310 --> 09:30.845
Very much.

09:30.846 --> 09:32.846
Doesn't have to be Asian.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.683
Don't worry.
You'll meet a girl someday.

09:36.684 --> 09:39.819
No, I won't. Yes, you will,
and she'll be beautiful.

09:39.820 --> 09:41.820
And kind and sexy and funny

09:41.821 --> 09:43.655
and everything you
ever wanted in a woman.

09:43.656 --> 09:44.723
You really think so?

09:44.724 --> 09:47.025
I do, and you'll fall
hopelessly in love

09:47.026 --> 09:48.459
and give her your heart.

09:48.460 --> 09:52.329
And she'll take it and grind it
into pathetic, little pieces.

09:53.731 --> 09:55.732
But we'll have sex first, right?

10:06.075 --> 10:09.277
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:09.278 --> 10:11.812
That's Eye-talian.

10:11.813 --> 10:15.515
So, um, was Leonard okay
with you coming over?

10:15.516 --> 10:17.384
Oh, yes.

10:17.385 --> 10:20.186
In fact, he said, "I'm fine.
I don't care."

10:20.187 --> 10:22.021
And he in no way
said it in a manner

10:22.022 --> 10:23.889
which would lead one to believe
that he was covering up

10:23.890 --> 10:25.825
feelings of anguish and betrayal.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.828
Well, good. I'm also

10:28.829 --> 10:32.564
pleased to report that he's
all cried out over you.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.098
He's been crying?

10:34.099 --> 10:36.334
Oh, I believe that
was something else

10:36.335 --> 10:37.701
I wasn't supposed to mention.

10:37.702 --> 10:41.004
Oh, God, I feel terrible.

10:41.005 --> 10:43.273
Do you have a stomachache, too?

10:43.274 --> 10:44.908
No. Why, do you?

10:44.909 --> 10:47.610
No.

10:47.611 --> 10:50.312
Why did you ask if I had one, too?

10:50.313 --> 10:53.348
Just making polite
dinner conversation.

10:53.349 --> 10:54.716
Your turn.

10:54.717 --> 10:57.952
All right.

10:57.953 --> 11:00.120
So, what's new in your life?

11:00.121 --> 11:05.558
Well, my new shoes are
not made for running.

11:07.394 --> 11:09.395
Have you been running?

11:09.396 --> 11:12.130
No.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.199
It's just a suspicion I have.

11:17.202 --> 11:20.070
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

11:20.071 --> 11:22.872
I'm so glad you like it. I do.

11:22.873 --> 11:24.674
Leonard never cooks for me.

11:24.675 --> 11:27.076
Well, maybe that's 'cause
Leonard can't cook.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.611
You can't cook and
you made me this.

11:31.047 --> 11:32.514
Whatever.

11:32.515 --> 11:34.548
Ooh, I'm gonna get the
cheesecake out of the fridge.

11:35.683 --> 11:38.051
Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.

11:44.518 --> 11:45.819
Look at this.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.421
Do you think she's
really doing that

11:47.422 --> 11:49.589
or is it PhotoShop?

11:52.726 --> 11:55.160
I'm pretty sure Martha
Stewart never got naked

11:55.161 --> 11:58.229
with a room full of big,
fat Japanese guys.

11:58.230 --> 12:00.765
You don't know that.

12:00.766 --> 12:03.801
Prison changes people.

12:05.226 --> 12:06.927
Hey, where you been?

12:06.928 --> 12:10.129
I told you, walking.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.297
For an hour and a half?

12:13.088 --> 12:15.456
I got lost.

12:16.591 --> 12:18.325
How could you get lost?
Your phone has GPS.

12:18.523 --> 12:22.359
Satellites are down. Solar flares.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.760
There are no solar
flares right now.

12:23.761 --> 12:24.994
Yes, there are.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.362
Dude, I'm an astrophysicist.

12:26.363 --> 12:28.864
If there were solar flares,
I'd be all up in it.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.901
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

12:32.902 --> 12:35.770
What I meant to say
was my battery died.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.940
What the hell was that about?

12:39.941 --> 12:41.408
I don't know.

12:41.409 --> 12:44.777
Do you think this is really Hillary
Clinton doing it with Oprah?

12:46.546 --> 12:49.314
Oh, we really need
to get you a girl.

12:52.469 --> 12:53.802
SHELDON Leonard.

12:54.971 --> 12:56.171
Leonard.

12:56.172 --> 12:57.438
Leonard.

12:57.439 --> 12:58.872
Oh, just come in!

13:00.307 --> 13:04.047
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

13:06.584 --> 13:08.618
What do you want, Sheldon?

13:08.619 --> 13:11.287
Maybe this isn't a good time.

13:11.288 --> 13:15.122
Tell me why you woke me up or I
swear to God I will kill you.

13:15.123 --> 13:17.791
Do you really think death threats

13:17.792 --> 13:19.959
are an appropriate way to
begin this conversation?

13:19.960 --> 13:24.062
Sometimes your lack of
social skills astonishes me.

13:24.063 --> 13:28.132
What do you want?

13:28.133 --> 13:31.335
You may want to sit down.

13:31.336 --> 13:33.137
I'm in bed!

13:33.138 --> 13:35.305
Point taken.

13:35.306 --> 13:36.607
You may want to sit up.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.341
Sheldon!

13:40.276 --> 13:42.977
I've been seeing Penny
behind your back.

13:50.484 --> 13:53.419
Okay...

13:53.420 --> 13:58.323
When you say "seeing Penny,
" what exactly does that mean?

13:58.324 --> 14:00.592
We had dinner last night.

14:00.593 --> 14:03.561
She made me spaghetti with
little hot dogs cut up in it.

14:03.562 --> 14:05.430
Well, little hot dog.

14:05.431 --> 14:08.432
I gave up the other five
hot dogs to a real dog.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.766
A real, big dog.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.702
A hell hound.

14:12.703 --> 14:14.404
Tangential to the primary story.

14:14.405 --> 14:16.505
How about I circle back to it?

14:16.506 --> 14:18.640
Fine.

14:18.641 --> 14:20.543
Why did you have dinner with Penny?

14:20.544 --> 14:22.645
I told you, she made spaghetti
with little hot dogs.

14:22.646 --> 14:25.013
I like spaghetti
with little hot dogs.

14:25.014 --> 14:28.215
Then why did you have
Chinese food with us?

14:28.216 --> 14:30.049
I didn't want to upset you.

14:30.050 --> 14:32.783
Howard made it very clear
that my allegiance should be

14:32.784 --> 14:36.954
to male comrades before women
who sell their bodies for money.

14:38.992 --> 14:43.062
Is it possible he said,
"Bros before hos"?

14:44.130 --> 14:47.699
Yes, but I rephrased it to
avoid offending the hos.

14:49.468 --> 14:53.036
Sheldon, I don't care if you
want to be friends with Penny.

14:53.037 --> 14:57.674
Oh. Well, so the emotional
turmoil that's been keeping me

14:57.675 --> 15:00.710
from achieving REM sleep
was entirely unjustified?

15:00.711 --> 15:02.711
Yes.

15:02.712 --> 15:06.281
Well... then as my
meemaw would say,

15:06.282 --> 15:09.584
"Looks like we butchered a pig,
but nobody wanted bacon."

15:11.920 --> 15:13.521
I guess not.

15:13.522 --> 15:16.424
And now, as promised, the tangent.

15:17.826 --> 15:19.859
Sheldon and the Hell Hound.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.725
Or <i>How I Lost My Hot Dogs.</i>

15:26.996 --> 15:28.830
Oh, um...

15:28.831 --> 15:30.098
I, I can come back.

15:31.007 --> 15:32.507
D-don't be silly.

15:32.508 --> 15:33.608
We're neighbors.

15:33.609 --> 15:34.809
We're going to run into each other.

15:34.810 --> 15:35.977
May as well get used to it.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.979
Yeah, I guess you're right.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.185
You used to it yet?

15:46.186 --> 15:48.087
Nope. Me neither.

15:49.322 --> 15:52.490
Oh, Sheldon seemed tthink
that I would be upset

15:52.491 --> 15:53.625
about you hanging out with him.

15:53.626 --> 15:55.159
But I just want you
to know it's fine.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.362
Oh, oh, good, because, um,
his mother called me.

15:59.397 --> 16:00.831
His mother?

16:00.832 --> 16:02.532
Yeah, she wants me
to take him shopping

16:02.533 --> 16:04.367
for sheets and towels.

16:05.569 --> 16:07.069
I was going to do that.

16:08.505 --> 16:10.272
Oh, well, then you... you do it.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.374
No, I don't <i>want</i> to do it.
You can do it.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.676
Okay, you can take him for shoes.

16:14.677 --> 16:16.744
I just took him for shoes.

16:16.745 --> 16:18.246
Well, all I know is he
says they hurt his feet.

16:21.054 --> 16:24.722
Fine. I'll take him for
shoes next Saturday.

16:24.723 --> 16:26.790
Oh, no, no, no-
a bunch of us from work

16:26.791 --> 16:28.192
are going to Disneyland
next Saturday

16:28.193 --> 16:29.559
and Sheldon wants to come.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.295
You're taking him to Disneyland?

16:32.296 --> 16:34.363
Well, he heard me making
plans on the phone.

16:34.364 --> 16:36.899
Was I going to say "no"?

16:37.734 --> 16:39.201
All right.

16:39.202 --> 16:41.269
But let me know if you're going
to stuff him with junk food.

16:41.270 --> 16:43.137
I don't want to bring
home a nice dinner for him

16:43.138 --> 16:45.339
and see it go to waste.

16:46.975 --> 16:48.175
We're going to Disneyland.

16:48.176 --> 16:49.943
He's going to eat junk food.

16:49.944 --> 16:53.245
All I'm saying is
give me a heads-up.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.946
Okay, whatever.

16:56.482 --> 16:59.116
And don't let him go on Space
Mountain after he eats.

16:59.117 --> 17:00.918
He'll say he can handle it,
but I promise

17:00.919 --> 17:02.886
you'll end up with churro
puke on your shoes.

17:02.887 --> 17:05.788
All right, got it.
Is there anything else?

17:05.789 --> 17:07.189
Yeah, don't let Goofy near him.

17:07.190 --> 17:10.023
He'll have nightmares and
I'll have to deal with it.

17:10.025 --> 17:11.625
What's the problem with Goofy?

17:11.626 --> 17:14.794
Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.

17:20.568 --> 17:22.569
Hey, do you think the elastic
woman in <i>The Incredibles</i>

17:22.569 --> 17:24.171
needs to use birth control

17:24.172 --> 17:26.638
or can she just be a diaphra?

17:29.610 --> 17:30.777
Well, that's it.

17:30.778 --> 17:32.778
We're officially out of
things to talk about.

17:33.913 --> 17:36.081
We're home.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.951
It's 10:00.

17:38.952 --> 17:40.352
Where have you been? We stayed

17:40.353 --> 17:42.754
for the California
Adventure water show.

17:42.755 --> 17:45.123
It was pure Disney magic.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.591
I was going to see that with him.

17:47.592 --> 17:49.192
How was I supposed to know that?

17:49.193 --> 17:51.527
It's all right.
I'll see it again with you.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.729
And I have food here.
You said you were ing to call.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.030
I know, I know.

17:55.031 --> 17:55.997
I can still eat.

17:55.998 --> 17:57.165
No, you already threw up once.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.066
Go put on your PJs
and brush your teeth.

18:01.569 --> 18:03.436
Okay, but just don't fight

18:03.437 --> 18:05.572
Wee not fighting. Just go.

18:08.476 --> 18:10.810
Aren't you going to thank Penny
for taki you to Disneyland?

18:10.811 --> 18:13.178
Thank you, Penny.

18:14.113 --> 18:16.448
You're welcome, sweetie.

18:16.449 --> 18:18.249
Want a cup of coffee?

18:18.250 --> 18:21.585
Oh, um, I should
probably get going.

18:21.586 --> 18:25.922
Come on. It's just a cup of coffee.

18:32.395 --> 18:36.531
Uh, yeah, the whole thing seems
a little twisted to me, too.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.666
What am I smelling?

18:38.667 --> 18:41.101
Sheldon's churro on my shoes.

18:56.577 --> 18:59.244
He's such an angel
when he's asleep.

18:59.245 --> 19:01.112
Yeah.

19:01.113 --> 19:03.281
Shame he has to wake up.

19:06.017 --> 19:07.851
I think we can do it.

19:07.852 --> 19:10.220
Smother Sheldon in his sleep?

19:10.221 --> 19:12.388
Wouldn't that be wrong?

19:13.123 --> 19:16.558
No, be friends. You and me.

19:16.559 --> 19:19.494
Oh. Sure.

19:19.495 --> 19:21.129
Absolutely.

19:21.130 --> 19:23.498
Good. I'm glad.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.867
Here's aidea. I'm just
throwing it out tre:

19:26.868 --> 19:29.036
friends who have sex.

19:31.072 --> 19:33.406
Good night, Leonard.

19:33.407 --> 19:35.041
Kidding.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.409
Just a couple of
friends goofin' around.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.145
No, Goofy, no.
