because I have
known real love.

02:06:31.668 --> 02:06:33.961
Oh, don't rust
yourself, now.

02:06:47.642 --> 02:06:49.142
Oh, Dorothy.

02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:55.524
lf it hadn't been for you,

02:06:55.608 --> 02:06:58.277
l'd still be back
on that pedestal,

02:07:00.405 --> 02:07:02.030
afraid to live.

02:07:03.908 --> 02:07:05.200
Me, too.

02:07:08.955 --> 02:07:13.292
Thank you.

02:07:14.294 --> 02:07:16.712
Thank you for
being my friends.

02:07:19.716 --> 02:07:21.300
l'm ready now.

02:07:23.136 --> 02:07:24.720
Think of home.

02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:29.099
Home.

02:07:38.401 --> 02:07:40.193
(SlNGlNG)
When I think of home

02:07:40.278 --> 02:07:42.654
l think of a place

02:07:42.739 --> 02:07:47.576
Where there's
love overflowing

02:07:49.037 --> 02:07:51.330
l wish I was home

02:07:51.414 --> 02:07:53.623
l wish I was back there

02:07:53.916 --> 02:07:59.087
With the things
l've been knowing

02:07:59.547 --> 02:08:02.591
Wind that makes
the tall trees

02:08:02.675 --> 02:08:05.302
bend into leaning

02:08:05.386 --> 02:08:08.889
Suddenly the snowflakes
that fall

02:08:08.973 --> 02:08:10.724
have a meaning

02:08:10.808 --> 02:08:15.145
Sprinkling the scene

02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:20.817
Makes it all clean

02:08:25.156 --> 02:08:29.201
Maybe there's a chance
for me to go back

02:08:29.285 --> 02:08:34.247
Now that I have
some direction

02:08:35.792 --> 02:08:40.212
lt would sure be nice
to be back home

02:08:40.296 --> 02:08:46.259
Where there's
love and affection

02:08:46.344 --> 02:08:48.387
And just maybe l

02:08:48.471 --> 02:08:52.099
can convince time to slow up

02:08:52.183 --> 02:08:57.562
Giving me enough time
in my life to grow up

02:08:57.647 --> 02:09:02.651
Time, be my friend

02:09:02.735 --> 02:09:08.532
Let me start again

02:09:11.327 --> 02:09:13.453
Suddenly, my world's gone

02:09:13.538 --> 02:09:15.247
And changed its face

02:09:15.331 --> 02:09:20.419
But I still know
where l'm going

02:09:21.212 --> 02:09:25.215
l have had my mind
spun around in space

02:09:25.299 --> 02:09:30.095
And yet l've
watched it growing

02:09:30.179 --> 02:09:33.056
And if you're listening, God

02:09:33.141 --> 02:09:35.100
Please don't make it hard

02:09:35.184 --> 02:09:38.145
To know if we should
believe the things

02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:40.313
that we see

02:09:40.398 --> 02:09:42.899
Tell us, should we run away?

02:09:42.984 --> 02:09:44.734
Should we try and stay?

02:09:44.819 --> 02:09:50.323
Or would it be better
just to let things be?

02:09:50.408 --> 02:09:55.412
Living here in
this brand new world

02:09:55.496 --> 02:10:00.292
might be a fantasy

02:10:00.376 --> 02:10:05.172
But it taught me to love

02:10:05.256 --> 02:10:10.427
So it's real, real to me

02:10:10.511 --> 02:10:12.179
And l've learned

02:10:12.263 --> 02:10:16.475
That we must look
inside our hearts

02:10:16.559 --> 02:10:20.562
to find

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:24.816
A world full of love

02:10:24.901 --> 02:10:29.946
like yours, like mine

02:10:30.031 --> 02:10:36.953
Like home
