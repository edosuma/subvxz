Thank you.

00:39.455 --> 00:42.127
Oh. (laughs) Captain Ross.

00:42.161 --> 00:44.131
Hey, Tawny.

00:44.165 --> 00:46.236
Yeah, I was just having a quick
nightcap with the other girls.

00:46.269 --> 00:47.706
They were wondering
where you were.

00:47.739 --> 00:50.244
Oh, you know.
Off to get some ice.

00:50.277 --> 00:52.114
I am just bushed.

00:52.147 --> 00:54.218
Know how you feel.

00:54.252 --> 00:57.559
Since we're both staying in,
maybe we could stay together.

00:57.592 --> 01:00.531
-(elevator bell dings)
-That's, um...

01:00.565 --> 01:03.704
-a very nice offer, Tawny.
-Mm.

01:03.738 --> 01:07.111
I'm extremely flattered,
but I'm also...

01:07.144 --> 01:09.115
Oh.

01:09.148 --> 01:11.286
You know the funny thing
about these?

01:11.319 --> 01:13.758
They come right off.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.730
Sorry.

01:16.764 --> 01:18.601
Mine doesn't come off.

01:18.634 --> 01:20.705
Excuse me.

had breakfast yet.

02:50.718 --> 02:52.622
Yeah?

02:52.655 --> 02:54.258
Just did.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.462
Poor guy over there,
fishing with his son

02:56.497 --> 02:57.932
when he spotted the body.

02:57.966 --> 03:00.203
Fishing in the Hudson?
You're shitting me.

(indistinct radio transmission)

03:05.648 --> 03:07.652
Oh, my God. Jesus.

03:07.685 --> 03:10.290

-Just this.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.827
The Brownstone.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.931
-It's a fruit stand over on...
-Yeah, I know what it is.

03:13.964 --> 03:17.672
Anything else?
I don't see any visible wounds.

03:17.706 --> 03:19.710
Besides the obvious one.

03:19.743 --> 03:21.279
WOMAN:
Neck was severed around
the fourth cervical vertebra,

03:21.312 --> 03:23.283
right through the vocal cords.

03:23.316 --> 03:26.724
Well, at least we know what he
was doing right before he died.

03:26.757 --> 03:28.794
Yeah, Mulcahy?
What was he doing?

03:28.828 --> 03:30.263
Giving head.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.802
(laughter)

03:32.836 --> 03:34.506
HANNAH:
The levels of multiplication

03:34.539 --> 03:36.275
and mutation are more rapid
than anything

03:36.309 --> 03:38.413
-I've ever seen.
-Mm.

03:38.446 --> 03:40.417
And you're sure the samples
were properly handled?

03:40.450 --> 03:41.754
I went out to Fire Island

03:41.787 --> 03:43.456
and collected
and prepared them myself.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.262
WILLIAM:
And the symptoms
when they're displayed?

03:46.295 --> 03:48.534
Seizures, skin infection,

03:48.567 --> 03:50.437
liver failure.

03:51.874 --> 03:53.376
You have to get out there,

03:53.410 --> 03:55.480
talk to the mayor,
chief of police.

03:55.515 --> 03:58.988
At this level of mutation
and multiplication,

03:59.021 --> 04:01.927
we can have an epidemic
on our hands in months.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.798
MANNEY:
What happened to it?

04:03.831 --> 04:07.304
HANNAH:
It has a virus, a new one.

04:07.337 --> 04:08.874
I've been taking samples
from deer carcasses

04:08.908 --> 04:10.845
out on the island
for over a year,

04:10.878 --> 04:12.949
ever since the first buck died
with similar symptoms.

04:12.982 --> 04:15.621
MANNEY:
We've definitely been finding
more dead ones as of late.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.326
One of my deputies found three
dead together the other day.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.896
Looked like a family.

04:19.930 --> 04:22.334
Whatever this virus is,
it's highly communicable,

04:22.367 --> 04:24.338
and it could be mutating
too quickly

04:24.371 --> 04:26.543
for the deer's immune system
to fight it.

04:26.577 --> 04:29.014
LEMBEK:
If these deer here
are isolated on an island,

04:29.048 --> 04:32.555
then how the hell did they
suddenly catch some new disease?

04:32.589 --> 04:35.327
New diseases are born every day.
That's science.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.397
As scary as it may seem,

04:37.431 --> 04:39.068
if we don't start
mitigation efforts soon,

04:39.101 --> 04:41.707
it's going to wipe out
the entire population.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.311
You're going to have to kill
all the deer on this island.

04:44.345 --> 04:46.617
LEMBEK:
And if we don't,
they're all gonna die?

04:46.650 --> 04:49.589
HANNAH:
The deer are simply
the first carriers of the virus.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.361
And the way that it's mutating,
it could leap to humans

04:52.394 --> 04:53.831
if it hasn't already.

04:54.866 --> 04:56.469
Then we're gonna have to arm up

04:56.503 --> 04:58.674
and shoot down every deer
on this island.

05:01.112 --> 05:02.615
(rhythmic, mechanical beeping)

05:02.649 --> 05:04.686
(siren blaring)

05:19.649 --> 05:22.087
-What do you think?
-WOMAN: Hard to tell.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.458
Rats got to the head,
and the body was deformed

05:24.493 --> 05:26.095
-by the water.
-Right.

05:26.128 --> 05:28.534
Those cuts look pretty similar
to me.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.805
Could be, but I couldn't tell
you if they were the same blade.

05:30.838 --> 05:32.675
Well, come on. It's got to be.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.411
You know, if this was the head
and body of a pretty blonde

05:34.445 --> 05:36.683
16-year-old from Riverdale,
you'd have ten detectives

05:36.717 --> 05:39.088
-down here on the case.
-Hold up.

05:39.121 --> 05:42.662
Someone stuffed it
down in there pretty good.

05:42.695 --> 05:44.398
Holy shit.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.068
Was that the cause of death?

05:46.102 --> 05:47.906
Or could somebody have stuffed
that down there post-mortem?

05:47.939 --> 05:49.709
Teeth are intact, which means

05:49.743 --> 05:52.014
he probably didn't struggle
when it was being put in.

05:52.047 --> 05:55.922
Don't the homosexuals use
colored handkerchiefs like this

05:55.955 --> 05:57.825
to let others know
what they're into?

05:57.859 --> 06:00.932
Saw something about it
on Donahue.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.771
Thanks.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.543
(indistinct chatter)

06:06.577 --> 06:09.014
Where's Gino Barelli?

06:10.685 --> 06:13.389
We want to lodge
a formal complaint.

06:13.423 --> 06:15.393
What do I look like,
your hairdresser?

06:15.427 --> 06:17.565
Ha! Your paper is here
to serve the gay community,

06:17.599 --> 06:19.101
but you're ignoring half of it.

06:19.134 --> 06:21.405
Listen, if you want
to apply for a job

06:21.439 --> 06:23.611
or submit a freelance article

06:23.644 --> 06:25.982
or an op-ed,
please, be my guest.

06:26.015 --> 06:27.785
Hey, lesbians have issues, too.

06:27.819 --> 06:29.856
Why don't you ever write
about women's health issues?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.060
How the ERA is
completely stalled out?

06:32.094 --> 06:33.998
How we can't get access
to health care...

06:34.031 --> 06:35.868
Yeah. Write about that.

06:35.902 --> 06:38.106
You know, I would really love
to write about those issues,

06:38.139 --> 06:41.078
but I'm a gay man,
so I write about issues

06:41.112 --> 06:42.916
that are important to gay men.

06:42.949 --> 06:45.053
Oh, yeah? What are you writing
about that's so important?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.961
I'm writing about how gay men
are being hunted

06:48.994 --> 06:50.598
and killed in this town.

06:50.631 --> 06:52.034
Wasn't us.

06:52.067 --> 06:54.673
All right, ladies,
it's time to go.

06:57.210 --> 07:00.651
-Wait. This is a...
Is this a threat?
-FRAN: No.

07:00.685 --> 07:02.822
Sounds like you need something
to protect yourself.

07:13.109 --> 07:14.713
(door opens)

07:14.746 --> 07:16.482
Is that you?

07:18.921 --> 07:20.558
Something smells good.

07:20.591 --> 07:22.829
PATRICK:
Oh. Beef Bolognese.

07:29.542 --> 07:30.911
How was your day?

07:30.945 --> 07:32.882
GINO (sighing):
Oh...

07:35.821 --> 07:38.560
Really? I didn't know
our mayor liked boys.

07:38.594 --> 07:41.633
(laughs)
Homophobic Hall of Shame.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.971
First annual issue.

07:44.004 --> 07:46.777
You should thank me
for not including you.

07:46.810 --> 07:48.781
-Funny.
-Seriously.

07:48.814 --> 07:51.118
Your precinct has more
complaints from the community

07:51.152 --> 07:52.889
than any other precinct
in Manhattan.

07:52.922 --> 07:55.126
It's just a lot of old-school
guys all in one place.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.963
Keep defending them.

07:56.997 --> 07:59.736
You should quit
and do something else.

07:59.769 --> 08:01.807
I don't know how
to do anything else.

08:02.809 --> 08:04.813
That's not exactly true.

08:04.846 --> 08:06.883
(Patrick chuckles)

08:12.895 --> 08:14.766
What's the matter?
You look tense.

08:14.799 --> 08:17.104
We found another body.

08:18.072 --> 08:20.611
By the piers.
He was missing a head.

08:20.644 --> 08:22.915
What the fuck?

08:24.652 --> 08:26.523
Oh, Jesus, Patrick.

08:26.556 --> 08:28.727
-That's three now.
-Mm-hmm.

08:28.761 --> 08:30.698
Is the department gonna hold
a press conference?

08:30.731 --> 08:32.100
-People need to know about this.
-No.

08:32.134 --> 08:33.804
And I am telling you this
off the record.

08:33.837 --> 08:36.810
I'm not supposed to talk
about this with anyone.

08:36.843 --> 08:38.814
I'm not "anyone."

08:38.847 --> 08:40.818
I'm the guy
you supposedly love.

08:40.851 --> 08:42.755
I should be writing about--

08:42.789 --> 08:45.761
Hell, the New York Times
should be writing about it,

08:45.795 --> 08:47.865
-and you should be helping.
-I-I can't.

08:47.899 --> 08:49.301
Gino, we have talked about this.

08:49.334 --> 08:50.971
We have to keep
our professional lives separate.

08:51.005 --> 08:53.042
Oh, really?
When it's life-and-death?

08:53.076 --> 08:55.146
-Those are the rules?
-Just think
what you want to think.

08:55.180 --> 08:59.088
But I am not going to jeopardize
my career to be your source.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.760
The fuck good are you?

09:01.793 --> 09:03.096
(Gino sighs)

09:03.129 --> 09:06.001
What the fuck am I doing?

09:06.035 --> 09:08.841
-What am I doing?
-What are you talking about?

09:08.874 --> 09:11.980
What the fuck
am I doing with you?

09:12.013 --> 09:15.153
Here in this sham
of a relationship?

09:15.186 --> 09:16.623
Hey, hey, hey, no.
Don't say that.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.092
It's not a sham, okay?

09:18.126 --> 09:19.696
I did not go through
everything

09:19.729 --> 09:21.031
that I've gone through
in my life

09:21.065 --> 09:23.069
to go back into the closet
for a guy

09:23.102 --> 09:25.841
who does not want
to be what he truly is.

09:25.875 --> 09:30.083
Yeah, maybe, but I am
very good in bed.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.757
(soft chuckle)

09:37.932 --> 09:40.270
(sighs)

09:43.176 --> 09:45.280
Gino...

09:48.085 --> 09:50.190
I am doing the best I can.

09:54.298 --> 09:55.801
Maybe that's just...

09:55.835 --> 09:58.607
That's not enough.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.611
We need you.

10:00.644 --> 10:02.147
I need you.

10:07.925 --> 10:09.963
Not like this.

10:11.031 --> 10:13.002
Where are you going?

10:13.035 --> 10:15.140
Somewhere.

10:15.173 --> 10:17.845
-Anywhere where I'm not hiding.
-Mm.

10:17.879 --> 10:20.083
Or helping someone to hide.

10:21.252 --> 10:24.324
Come on, Gino. Let's just...

10:24.358 --> 10:25.861
(door opens)

10:25.895 --> 10:27.632
(door closes)

10:29.034 --> 10:31.238
(sighs)
Shit.

10:34.813 --> 10:36.750
SHERIFF (on TV):
Mr. Ewing?

10:36.783 --> 10:38.921
-Yeah.
-Mr. Barnes made
a very serious accusation.

10:38.954 --> 10:40.658
He claims you pushed
Miss Shepard off that balcony.

10:40.691 --> 10:42.060
J.R.:
That man is a damn liar.

10:42.093 --> 10:43.897
I saw him...

10:43.931 --> 10:45.400
ADAM:
I was watching that.

10:45.433 --> 10:47.137
Mm. Come on.
Get yourself cleaned up.

10:47.170 --> 10:49.074
You're coming out with me.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.212
I don't want to go anywhere.

10:52.247 --> 10:54.318
Fuck off, Sully.

10:54.351 --> 10:56.322
You have been eating
breakfast cereal and watching TV

10:56.355 --> 10:58.226
for six days.

10:58.259 --> 11:02.000
Adam, I could understand one day
'cause of his hot little accent,

11:02.033 --> 11:05.173
but any longer is just
you feeling sorry for yourself.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.712
I was falling in love with him.

11:07.745 --> 11:10.049
Bullshit. You were falling
in love with falling in love.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.120
Get off of me.

11:13.322 --> 11:15.293
I really need you tonight.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.830
I got to do some business,

11:16.863 --> 11:18.232
and I don't want
to go out there alone.

11:18.266 --> 11:20.370
Are those drugs?

11:20.403 --> 11:22.040
What's the hurry
with selling ludes?

11:22.073 --> 11:24.077
The price is skyrocketing,
I really need the money,

11:24.111 --> 11:25.948
and you really need
some fresh air.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.720
Fine.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.826
Where are we going?
What is this?

11:31.860 --> 11:34.097
Only one of the best places
in the world.

11:34.131 --> 11:36.335
(indistinct shouting)

11:36.368 --> 11:38.339
You're not here
to sell those pills, are you?

11:38.372 --> 11:40.210
Okay, so maybe I lied.

11:40.243 --> 11:42.414
Had to get you
off that couch, okay?

11:42.447 --> 11:44.384
-This is dirty.
-I'm doing you a favor.

11:44.418 --> 11:46.255
It's giving me the creeps.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.228
Well, I'm shaking, but it's not
'cause they're creeps.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.100
(indistinct chatter)

11:56.175 --> 11:57.845

anywhere with that guy.

12:00.951 --> 12:02.922
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:06.295 --> 12:09.167
-What am I supposed to do?
-Have fun.

12:34.418 --> 12:36.455

12:37.925 --> 12:39.294
Come on, Sully.

12:39.328 --> 12:42.133
(rustling in brush)

12:48.045 --> 12:51.886
Hey, man,
I-I don't want any trouble.

12:58.165 --> 12:59.368
Sully?!

12:59.401 --> 13:03.275
Adam? Sorry.
That's my roommate.

13:03.309 --> 13:06.081
-Adam?
-Sully?

13:07.083 --> 13:08.987
Adam?

13:13.262 --> 13:15.400

13:31.933 --> 13:34.037
(panting)

13:37.110 --> 13:38.479
Okay, tell me again.

13:38.513 --> 13:41.385
How was this tall individual
dressed?

13:41.418 --> 13:45.326
He was wearing a-a hood
and all leather,

13:45.360 --> 13:47.565
and, uh, he wasn't just tall.

13:47.598 --> 13:49.267
-He was gigantic.
-PATRICK: Okay.

13:49.301 --> 13:52.173
Okay, but, uh, his dress--

13:52.207 --> 13:54.311
by leather clothes, would
you say he was a leather man?

13:55.446 --> 13:58.486
Part of a gay, uh,
leather subculture?

13:58.520 --> 14:02.495
Like what you might find
at places like, uh, uh,

14:02.528 --> 14:04.431
The Backfill Club?

14:04.464 --> 14:07.303
I don't know.
I-I have... never been.

14:07.337 --> 14:09.274
I haven't been anywhere
like that.

14:10.276 --> 14:11.579
(typing)

14:11.613 --> 14:13.517
(indistinct chatter)

14:13.550 --> 14:16.155
You're gonna tell me you can't
do anything, aren't you?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.161
I knew this was a waste of time.

14:20.363 --> 14:22.100
You don't give a shit about us.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.071
Every day, we're getting beaten,
and we are dying,

14:24.104 --> 14:27.210
-and the police
don't give a shit.
-Cut the drama, okay?

14:27.243 --> 14:29.247
If that were true,
I would not have had

14:29.281 --> 14:31.218
to chuck my shoes away
because they were covered

14:31.251 --> 14:33.055
in polluted river water.

14:41.004 --> 14:43.242
So there was a body
by the piers?

14:43.275 --> 14:44.912
And you're looking into it.

14:44.946 --> 14:46.616
Oh, I just bring it out
to make a point, okay?

14:46.649 --> 14:49.121
Some of us actually care.

14:49.154 --> 14:50.958
And the reason
I can't help you today is not

14:50.991 --> 14:52.293
because
your roommate's homosexual.

14:52.327 --> 14:53.630
It's because
he's only been missing 12 hours.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.601
Plus, there is no evidence
of a crime.

14:55.634 --> 14:58.372
What about that scream
in the park? That guy?

14:58.406 --> 15:01.145
You heard a yell, and
some leather guy followed you.

15:01.178 --> 15:03.950
Go home.
Wait for your roommate.

15:03.984 --> 15:05.286
If he doesn't show up
by Thursday,

15:05.319 --> 15:06.623
you come back and see me.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.192
I'll take a full report.

MARZARA:
You just sent the guy away
'cause it's not

15:17.711 --> 15:19.715
a missing persons case.
What are we talking about?

15:19.749 --> 15:21.418
Maybe we should look into it.

15:21.452 --> 15:24.057
The body in the river,
the two others last month?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.594
I'm getting a very bad feeling
in my gut.

15:25.627 --> 15:26.629
Yeah, I get a bad feeling
in my gut

15:26.663 --> 15:28.232
every time I open the newspaper.

15:28.265 --> 15:29.669
I'm worried we're seeing
a pattern here, Chief.

15:29.702 --> 15:31.973
Someone could be targeting
the gay community.

15:32.006 --> 15:33.543

it's not a pattern.

15:35.981 --> 15:37.484
Let me tell you something.

15:37.518 --> 15:40.256
The people that make up
that "community"?

15:40.289 --> 15:42.293
They come to the city
for a reason.

15:42.327 --> 15:45.466
They come here to get lost,
and that's exactly what they do.

15:45.501 --> 15:47.237
Sounds like
you've thought about this.

15:47.270 --> 15:48.573
-Yeah, it's 20 years' experience
talking.

You know, they called her

'cause she could see things
no one else could see.

20:51.746 --> 20:53.983
And she always said that I was
her favorite in the family

22:55.860 --> 22:57.831
THEO:
Hmm.

22:57.864 --> 22:59.702
Oh.

22:59.735 --> 23:02.841
Sounds like Big Daddy,
or that's what we called him.

23:02.874 --> 23:05.914
I don't know his real name,
and I haven't seen him in years.

23:05.947 --> 23:07.851
(door opens)

23:07.884 --> 23:10.422
You can put your clothes
back on.

23:22.981 --> 23:24.852
Would you mind, uh,

23:24.885 --> 23:27.691
calling me...

23:29.595 --> 23:31.599
...if you see
this Big Daddy again

23:31.632 --> 23:33.636
or hear anything about him?

23:35.507 --> 23:37.611
I think he's hurting people.

23:37.644 --> 23:39.848
Oh. I'll do my best
to avoid him.

23:40.784 --> 23:42.854
♪ Nothing left ♪

23:45.727 --> 23:47.564

23:49.167 --> 23:51.171

23:52.574 --> 23:54.010
-Who's that?
-(door opens)

23:54.043 --> 23:55.847
Did you get anything good
of him?

23:55.880 --> 23:57.450
-(door closes)
-Well, I didn't get him

23:57.483 --> 24:00.155
squatting over
a traffic cone, so...

24:00.189 --> 24:02.026
nothing
you'll think is worthwhile.

24:02.059 --> 24:04.030
(Sam chuckling)

24:04.063 --> 24:07.103
I am so sick of you acting
like you're the artist,

24:07.136 --> 24:09.742
and I'm some checkbook
with a dick.

24:09.775 --> 24:11.746
My eye for what's now
and what collectors want

24:11.779 --> 24:14.150
pays for all of this,
and your little pad on Spring

24:14.183 --> 24:16.121
and your cocaine habit.

24:16.154 --> 24:19.027
Maybe you should date
a pornographer instead, Sam.

24:19.060 --> 24:21.632
Our clientele can't hang
pornography on their walls

24:21.666 --> 24:23.603
and invite the neighbors over
to look at it,

24:23.636 --> 24:26.509
so if they want a photo
of an asshole in a public space,

24:26.542 --> 24:28.145
they need
to have paid $50,000 for it.

24:28.178 --> 24:30.215
(laughs)

24:31.552 --> 24:33.055
Don't worry, baby.

24:33.088 --> 24:35.125
I'm still photographing boys
and their toys.

24:35.159 --> 24:40.537
Yeah, but your artist's heart
isn't in it, and I see.

24:40.570 --> 24:42.874
And I can convince
the closeted stockbrokers

24:42.908 --> 24:44.678
and the nouveau riche
Hollywood executives

24:44.712 --> 24:46.782
that the new work is as
aesthetically true as the old,

24:46.816 --> 24:49.855
but, eventually, they're gonna
figure out that it isn't.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.771
Something dark is coming.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.046
Can't you feel it out there
when you walk down the street?

25:02.079 --> 25:03.683
You sound
like your grandmother again.

25:03.716 --> 25:06.287
-Because I'm right.
-(sniffing)

25:06.321 --> 25:10.162
Look, for now,
I need to look away from it,

25:10.195 --> 25:13.936
and use my eyes
to see the obvious beauty,

25:13.970 --> 25:15.239
or else the darkness is...

25:15.272 --> 25:17.844
-It's gonna swallow me up.
-Yeah, well,

25:17.878 --> 25:19.848
we're not gonna
let that happen, are we?

25:19.882 --> 25:21.184
(sniffing)

25:21.217 --> 25:23.556
Hmm?

25:25.359 --> 25:27.698
I've got a marvelous idea
for a new series of photographs.

25:27.731 --> 25:29.968
I'm in the process
of setting it up.

25:30.002 --> 25:32.306
You... will...

25:32.339 --> 25:34.545
love it.

25:52.313 --> 25:54.551
-Where are you going?
-Out.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.691
Okay, uh...

25:57.724 --> 25:59.227
Wait.

26:00.630 --> 26:03.536
Smoke the peace pipe?

26:13.155 --> 26:15.994
(clears throat, sniffles)

26:16.027 --> 26:17.831
So, uh...

26:17.864 --> 26:20.235
So, look, I asked Marzara
if I could leak a story

26:20.269 --> 26:23.008
about this possible
serial killer to a reporter,

26:23.041 --> 26:25.012
and he told me if I did that,
I'd end up in a morgue,

26:25.045 --> 26:27.116
and he meant it.

26:27.149 --> 26:29.621
If word got out
that I did anything

26:29.655 --> 26:33.763
to make the NYPD look bad,
I'd be a dead man.

26:33.796 --> 26:36.735
I'm not looking
to break a big story, Pat.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.739
Come on.
This is about people dying.

26:38.773 --> 26:41.912
Now, I am not gonna give you
any more information

26:41.946 --> 26:43.649
on this investigation,

26:43.683 --> 26:46.889
but I would like

26:46.922 --> 26:49.761
to ask you some questions.

26:50.763 --> 26:52.767
Oh.

26:55.339 --> 26:57.376
Okay.

27:02.687 --> 27:05.025
What does
a blue handkerchief mean?

27:05.058 --> 27:06.394
(laughs) Oh, God.

27:06.427 --> 27:09.802
You boys
who came out late are so...

27:09.835 --> 27:11.906
charmingly naïve.

27:13.375 --> 27:16.414
You really never heard
of the handkerchief code?

27:16.447 --> 27:18.653
Really?

27:18.686 --> 27:20.657
Well...

27:20.690 --> 27:22.928
we're not like the straights,
where, when you go

27:22.961 --> 27:25.800
to a pickup bar, everybody knows
pretty much what you're into.

27:25.834 --> 27:27.436
You stick it in,
you move it around a little bit,

27:27.469 --> 27:29.440
and you hope she's on the pill.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.979
No.

27:32.012 --> 27:34.383
Our tastes are more...

27:34.417 --> 27:37.189
specific.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.759
And we're not afraid
to let people know

27:38.793 --> 27:40.329
before our clothes come off,
which is why

27:40.362 --> 27:42.366
they invented
the handkerchief code.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.370
I've seen that.
All those guys walking around

27:44.403 --> 27:46.307
down on Christopher Street
with the bandanas

27:46.341 --> 27:47.443
hanging out their back pockets?

27:47.476 --> 27:48.980
Huh.

27:49.013 --> 27:51.351
Light blue
in your right pocket

27:51.384 --> 27:53.388
means you like to give head.

27:53.421 --> 27:55.693
Left pocket means
you like to get head.

27:55.727 --> 27:57.697
Gray is for bondage.

27:57.731 --> 27:59.935
Black is for S&M.

27:59.968 --> 28:02.373
Yellow is f...

28:02.406 --> 28:04.010
self-explanatory.

28:04.043 --> 28:07.116
-Dark blue?
-Anal.

28:07.149 --> 28:08.920
Why?

28:10.188 --> 28:12.159
Did one of the dead men
have a blue one?

28:12.193 --> 28:14.263
Oh, come on. Gino.

28:14.297 --> 28:16.969
I'm asking the questions.

28:17.002 --> 28:19.708
(sighs)

28:21.879 --> 28:24.150
You ever been
to The Brownstone Bar?

28:24.183 --> 28:27.223
No, but I know where it is.
Why? You want to go?

28:27.256 --> 28:30.295
I'm not supposed to be actively
investigating this case.

28:30.329 --> 28:33.168
Right now, it's just
a bunch of unrelated bodies

28:33.201 --> 28:34.871
to the NYPD homicide unit.

28:34.905 --> 28:37.978
But the, uh, reporter's
not bound by those rules.

28:38.011 --> 28:40.917
He can do whatever he wants.

28:40.950 --> 28:42.921
Go to The Brownstone Bar.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.459
Ask whatever questions you need.

28:45.493 --> 28:47.697
Snoop.

28:52.473 --> 28:54.711
There's hope for you yet.

28:57.483 --> 28:59.755
Be safe.

29:11.177 --> 29:13.214
-Hi.
-Hey.

29:13.248 --> 29:16.487
I'd give you a hug,
but I have this summer cold,

29:16.522 --> 29:18.926
and I don't know
what the rules are between us.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.462
I want to be respectful.

29:20.496 --> 29:24.905
Well, there are no rules,
Barb, we can still hug.

29:24.938 --> 29:27.076
-We still love each other.
-Okay. (laughs)

29:27.109 --> 29:30.048
I feel stupid
even worrying about it,

29:30.082 --> 29:32.954
but this is all
just so weird for me.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.025
I know. I'm sorry.

29:41.404 --> 29:45.178
(exhales) All right. Uh...

29:45.212 --> 29:47.483
might as well
get this over with.

29:47.517 --> 29:50.857
Uh, have your lawyer
mark those up

29:50.890 --> 29:52.259
and then send it back to mine.

29:52.293 --> 29:54.931
I, uh... I...
Oh, thank you.

29:54.965 --> 29:56.935
I, uh... I... Thanks.

29:56.969 --> 30:00.977
I-I don't have... much, Barbara.

30:01.010 --> 30:03.114
But you'll see when you look
at those papers that I will do.

30:03.148 --> 30:05.118
my very best to make sure
you're looked after.

30:05.152 --> 30:07.089
Well, I already got a job...
at Bloomingdale's.

30:07.122 --> 30:10.095
-Ah.
-Women's formal shoes, I guess.

30:10.128 --> 30:13.936
Apparently, it's the place to be
if you work on commission, so...

30:15.138 --> 30:17.109
That's great, honey.

30:17.142 --> 30:19.180
Honey?

30:21.184 --> 30:24.123
Why couldn't you just
have been honest with me

30:24.156 --> 30:26.260
before we got married, Patrick?

30:26.294 --> 30:28.365
I was a coward,

30:28.398 --> 30:31.137
and I loved you.

30:31.170 --> 30:33.408
I thought I could make it work.

30:33.441 --> 30:36.247
Well, you and your secrets.

30:37.917 --> 30:40.455
You are unknowable.

Well, lucky me.

31:28.384 --> 31:30.489
I'm looking at a time traveler.

31:30.523 --> 31:32.994
A man from that bygone era

31:33.027 --> 31:35.065
when courtship began
innocently enough

31:35.098 --> 31:36.668
with the purchase
of a cocktail and a "hello."

Yeah, the good old days.

31:50.262 --> 31:53.067
Why ask me for an interview?

31:53.101 --> 31:56.374
Did that bartender whisper
coquettishly in your ear

31:56.407 --> 31:59.480
about my surrealism collection
back at my brownstone?

You're a regular here.

Oh.

32:16.247 --> 32:17.617
Mm.

32:19.153 --> 32:21.290
How can I help you, Lois Lane?

32:22.426 --> 32:25.098
I'm working on a story
about a possible serial killer

32:25.132 --> 32:27.971
trolling the bars and the piers
targeting gay men.

32:28.004 --> 32:30.977
And this story
you're writing about lately--

32:31.010 --> 32:32.412
do you think
this is going to, what--

32:32.446 --> 32:34.551
compel your readers to action?

32:34.584 --> 32:37.156
Do you think
the gay men of this city

32:37.189 --> 32:40.496
are gonna change their ways
and start protecting themselves

32:40.530 --> 32:42.266
against the danger
that you're writing about?

32:42.299 --> 32:44.270
Well, from the sizes
of the crowds

32:44.303 --> 32:46.608
outside the bathhouses
and the bars

32:46.642 --> 32:49.213
and on the street corners,

32:49.246 --> 32:51.417
-I would say "no."
-Hmm.

32:51.450 --> 32:53.421
I think this is a mistake.

32:53.454 --> 32:55.626
There's a predator out there.

32:55.660 --> 32:58.999
Well, how can there not be?

32:59.033 --> 33:03.041
Predators thrive
on decadence and excess.

33:03.074 --> 33:06.314
You know, two doors down
from this very spot,

33:06.347 --> 33:10.322
there is a bar called "The Hole"
where, 24 hours a day,

33:10.355 --> 33:13.127
they employ, as an unpaid
volunteer, a young man

33:13.161 --> 33:14.998
for any and all to enjoy.

33:15.031 --> 33:19.039
Now I enjoy a plump rump
as well as the next man,

33:19.073 --> 33:21.043
but how can the darkness
not feel welcome

33:21.077 --> 33:22.379
in an establishment like that?

33:22.412 --> 33:24.551
I'm not looking for the darkness

33:24.584 --> 33:26.053
as an idea.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.291
I'm looking for... a man.

33:29.326 --> 33:31.130
A man who kills.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.403
I think he's been in this bar.

33:34.436 --> 33:36.140
HENRY:
I've seen him.

33:36.173 --> 33:38.746
Someone like him.

33:38.779 --> 33:41.818
He usually comes in late,
five minutes before closing

33:41.852 --> 33:45.593
when all the unloved queens,
too chubby or too...

33:45.626 --> 33:48.699
sad or too messy
have just about given up hope.

33:48.732 --> 33:52.740
He rides in
to bring the hope back to life.

33:52.774 --> 33:55.045
What does he look like?

33:55.078 --> 33:56.582
(smacks lips)

33:56.615 --> 33:58.752
Honestly,
by the time he comes in,

33:58.786 --> 34:01.758
I'm already too deep
to notice the...

34:01.792 --> 34:03.596
specifics of a man.

34:05.098 --> 34:06.768
Mm.

34:06.802 --> 34:08.772
One thing I can tell you.

34:08.806 --> 34:11.712
He seems drawn to the ones
that like mai tais.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.218
And once he leaves with them,

34:15.252 --> 34:17.289
I never see them again.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.364
Can I use your name
in the article?

34:21.397 --> 34:23.669
So this killer can
come after me next?

34:24.671 --> 34:26.775
I'm in the phonebook,
sweetheart.

34:26.808 --> 34:29.179
No, thank you.

34:30.549 --> 34:32.587
I understand.

34:34.390 --> 34:36.762
-Thanks for your help.
-Mm.

34:48.451 --> 34:50.488
So I have to know
that you're gonna do

34:50.523 --> 34:52.225
whatever it is we ask you to do.

34:52.259 --> 34:54.229
That you're not gonna get there
and back out.

34:54.263 --> 34:55.733
Because our time is
very valuable.

34:58.505 --> 35:00.375
How's your pain threshold?

35:00.408 --> 35:02.379
I came to New York
to be an actor.

35:02.412 --> 35:04.483
I... I wouldn't want
