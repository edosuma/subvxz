01:30.274 --> 01:32.443
<i>All it takes is one word,</i>

01:32.526 --> 01:35.154
<i>one suggestion,</i>

01:35.238 --> 01:37.198
<i>and they're no longer in control.</i>

01:40.201 --> 01:45.081
<i>All they know is a singular,
intense need to follow me...</i>

01:46.958 --> 01:48.209
<i>to photograph me...</i>

01:49.711 --> 01:51.087
<i>to not get caught.</i>

02:21.659 --> 02:24.287
<i>Kilgrave's spy has no distractions...</i>

02:25.621 --> 02:27.791
<i>just an acute focus on me.</i>

02:29.208 --> 02:32.461
<i>Fortunately... not Luke.</i>

02:33.462 --> 02:35.506
<i>No photos of him.</i>

02:36.507 --> 02:38.259
<i>He should be safe.</i>

02:38.342 --> 02:39.677
Shit.

02:49.687 --> 02:50.814
Jessica Jones?

02:51.898 --> 02:52.899
Yeah?

02:52.982 --> 02:56.444
Audrey Eastman. I know I'm early.
I just want to get this over with.

02:56.527 --> 02:59.113
You mentioned
your divorce lawyer referred you.

02:59.197 --> 03:00.865
I'd love to thank him.
What was his name?

03:00.949 --> 03:01.950
Desmond Tobey.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.660
He's at Hogarth, Chao & Benowitz.

03:04.743 --> 03:07.163
- I hope you're as good as he says you are.
- I am.

03:07.246 --> 03:10.458
So is that sign just for show,
or do you actually have an office?

03:14.045 --> 03:17.631
That man has been trying to get into
his apartment for, like, five minutes.

03:17.715 --> 03:19.050
Nice building.

03:23.554 --> 03:25.306
Hey.

03:25.389 --> 03:26.807
You good?

03:28.101 --> 03:30.061
You care?

03:30.144 --> 03:32.313
Just don't wanna be another reason
for you to get high.

03:32.396 --> 03:34.148
Don't need a reason.

03:38.111 --> 03:39.403
Carlo thinks I'm an idiot.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.655
But I can smell it on him

03:41.739 --> 03:44.617
every time he sneaks into bed
at 3:00 in the morning.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.202
Wouldn't be his first affair, either.

03:46.285 --> 03:49.038
Some people can't
keep their lives in check.

03:49.122 --> 03:53.835
They just go along blindly ruining
the lives of everyone in their path.

03:53.918 --> 03:56.004
I'm sick of pretending
it doesn't matter.

04:02.969 --> 04:05.346
How long have you been in business?

04:05.429 --> 04:07.140
Why do you ask?

04:07.223 --> 04:09.183
I want to know
that if I write you a check,

04:09.267 --> 04:10.601
you'll stick around
long enough to earn it.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.853
I'll earn it.

04:11.936 --> 04:13.146
Sorry.

04:13.229 --> 04:17.024
It's Carlo, I thought I'd gotten used to
his lies and his wandering penis.

04:17.815 --> 04:20.904
My lawyer says that I need pictures
for the divorce.

04:20.987 --> 04:22.864
Of Carlo and his...

04:22.947 --> 04:25.074
- Mistress.
- Skank!

04:25.158 --> 04:27.326
Nothing plays like pictures in court.

04:27.410 --> 04:30.496
He'll ask for alimony.
I'm not giving him shit.

04:30.579 --> 04:34.500
I need you to catch him in flagrante.
You know, in the act...

04:34.583 --> 04:36.878
I know what in flagrante means.

04:38.462 --> 04:41.840
Carlo says he's meeting a client
Friday night.

04:41.925 --> 04:45.219
Of course, when I asked his assistant,
she knew nothing about it.

04:45.303 --> 04:50.141
Follow him after work, I guarantee he will
go straight from the office to her.

04:50.224 --> 04:53.436
The kind of pictures you're asking for...

04:53.519 --> 04:55.604
they're hard to look at.

04:55.688 --> 04:56.981
They're harder to forget.

04:57.065 --> 04:58.691
That's what I pay my shrink for.

04:59.483 --> 05:00.526
Circle of life.

05:01.485 --> 05:05.114
Look, I... I don't care if you have
to knock down his door to do it.

05:05.198 --> 05:07.158
I want you to get those pictures.

05:07.241 --> 05:10.494
In fact, I want him to know
that he is being photographed.

05:11.829 --> 05:12.871
So that's it?

05:12.956 --> 05:15.833
Follow your husband
and take sex pictures?

05:15.917 --> 05:16.960
Isn't that enough?

05:17.043 --> 05:19.462
And your divorce lawyer.

05:19.545 --> 05:21.505
- Dexter...
- Desmond Tobey.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.799
Tobey, right.

05:23.882 --> 05:26.010
He referred you to me himself?

05:26.094 --> 05:28.304
Yes, I already told you that.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.932
And you haven't had any conversations
with a British man?

05:31.015 --> 05:32.058
Dark hair, well-dressed?

05:32.141 --> 05:33.309
What?

05:39.273 --> 05:43.444
Standard contract.
I require a 50% deposit up front.

06:00.086 --> 06:02.463
- Hey.
<i>- He's back.</i>

06:03.464 --> 06:04.632
Trish, what's going on?

06:04.715 --> 06:07.218
He knows I'm alive.

06:07.301 --> 06:09.428
Kilgrave sent that cop back to kill me.

06:09.512 --> 06:11.930
There's two of them,
and they're right outside.

06:12.015 --> 06:14.392
- Go to your safe room. I'm on my way.
- Okay.

06:22.108 --> 06:25.528
Hey, Sarge,
doorman doesn't have the key.

06:25.611 --> 06:28.197
He said it's some kind of
reinforced security door.

06:31.617 --> 06:33.035
Get the ram.

06:44.422 --> 06:46.590
They're still here.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.810
Everybody clear the hall,
please.

07:01.397 --> 07:04.442
You sure there's a body in there?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.070
I'm sure.

07:09.363 --> 07:12.616
Kilgrave didn't send him back.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.454
Then why is he trying
to break down my door?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.497
He thinks he killed you.

07:20.749 --> 07:22.585
I recognize that look.

07:34.222 --> 07:35.556
It's you.

07:35.639 --> 07:38.059
Um, Sarge, that's not Trish Walker.

07:38.142 --> 07:39.852
No, no, this is the one who...

07:39.935 --> 07:42.438
Sorry, we had our headphones in.

07:42.521 --> 07:44.273
I'm helping Trish make a party mix.

07:44.357 --> 07:46.317
Everything okay?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.987
You're with Ms. Walker?

07:51.614 --> 07:53.741
Yes, she's with me.
This is my apartment.

07:53.824 --> 07:55.201
Are you all right, ma'am?

07:56.327 --> 07:57.328
I'm fine.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.288
Any violent incidents
we should know about?

07:59.372 --> 08:00.373
Anybody try to hurt you?

08:00.456 --> 08:02.833
I think I would know
if I'd been attacked.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.253
We're real sorry for the disturbance,
Ms. Walker.

08:06.629 --> 08:09.923
Uh, by the way, really big fan
of your show back in the day.

08:10.007 --> 08:12.218
<i>♪ It's Patsy!
I really wanna be your friend... ♪</i>

08:12.301 --> 08:14.345
That's sweet.
Thanks for watching.

08:14.428 --> 08:15.429
We gotta go, Sarge.

08:15.513 --> 08:18.141
Oh. Uh, wait, I...

08:19.475 --> 08:21.810
- I don't understand. No, no, no.
- Hey, Sergeant, take it easy.

08:21.894 --> 08:23.228
You gotta tell me
what's going on.

08:23.312 --> 08:24.813
- Tell me what's happening.
- Leave the lady alone.

08:24.897 --> 08:27.191
It's fine, he can stay.

08:33.364 --> 08:36.741
How can you be standing here?
I mean, how can you be all right?

08:37.534 --> 08:39.745
I am not all right.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.371
Trish, come on.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.125
I'm... I'm a goddamn monster.

08:47.503 --> 08:49.755
She knows it wasn't you.

08:51.549 --> 08:54.218
- She's just being dramatic.
- "Dramatic"?

08:55.886 --> 08:57.346
Come on.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.097
You could use some air.

09:03.352 --> 09:05.897
She's alive.
You've seen it.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.524
The best thing you can do for her
is stay away.

09:08.607 --> 09:11.944
No, I felt her dying in my hands.
She was dead.

09:16.365 --> 09:17.616
Sufentanil.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.911
It knocks people out.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.372
This is what made you think
that you killed Trish.

09:26.542 --> 09:29.086
You know, I've spent my whole life
protecting people.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.755
You're still you.
You just need time to...

09:31.839 --> 09:34.383
I did things in the line of duty,
horrible things,

09:34.467 --> 09:37.845
but I have never wanted
to kill an innocent woman.

09:37.928 --> 09:39.722
Do you want to kill her now?

09:39.805 --> 09:41.932
- No. God, no.
- No, because you never did.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.517
- Kilgrave wanted it.
- Kilgrave?

09:43.601 --> 09:46.729
- And he made you want it.
- Well, how?

09:46.812 --> 09:48.356
It doesn't matter how.

09:48.439 --> 09:51.567
He told you to jump, you jumped.
He's done with you.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.487
Well, he also told me to kill Ms. Walker.
Is he done with her, too?

09:55.196 --> 09:57.365
Look, just go home,
go to sleep, and move on.

09:57.448 --> 09:59.575
What happens when he finds out
that she's still alive?

09:59.658 --> 10:02.286
- I'll handle it.
- He'll send somebody else, won't he?

10:02.370 --> 10:03.662
It won't end till we stop him.

10:03.746 --> 10:07.208
It will end when I stop it.
You have no idea what's involved here.

10:07.291 --> 10:08.959
Well, I know there's a guy
who controls minds,

10:09.042 --> 10:11.795
and there's a woman
who flew out of the sky to save my life.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.422
I may not have your abilities,

10:13.506 --> 10:17.260
but I've got eight years Special Ops
and an entire police force to back me up.

10:17.343 --> 10:19.345
No police. I will handle it.

10:20.221 --> 10:21.722
You're not gonna make her feel safe,
Sergeant.

10:21.805 --> 10:24.099
Go home.

10:24.642 --> 10:27.102
I got her covered.

10:27.185 --> 10:29.772
I think I know a way
to get her off Kilgrave's hit list.

10:29.855 --> 10:32.065
But it's gonna be painful.

10:33.817 --> 10:36.278
And we're live in three, two...

10:36.362 --> 10:39.490
Hi, I'm Trish Walker
and this is <i>Trish Talk.</i>

10:42.368 --> 10:45.746
During my last broadcast,
I made some...

10:45.829 --> 10:50.501
flippant and disrespectful comments
about a certain individual.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.045
I was out of line by belittling this man,

10:53.128 --> 10:57.716
and ignorant of my own limitations
in challenging him.

10:57.800 --> 11:02.638
He is a very fascinating
and powerful man,

11:02.721 --> 11:04.807
deserving of respect,
and to that end,

11:05.933 --> 11:09.395
if he's listening, and I think he is...

11:09.478 --> 11:11.272
I want to apologize.

11:12.356 --> 11:14.525
I hope he forgives me.

11:20.197 --> 11:21.281
I need a shower.

11:21.365 --> 11:23.451
Saying the words doesn't make it true.

11:23.534 --> 11:25.953
Remember acting?
It's how you won that award.

11:26.036 --> 11:28.163
My mom blew half the jury
to get me that award.

11:28.246 --> 11:29.957
It might not have been about my acting.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.840
Fine, but Kilgrave knows
you're afraid of him,

11:31.875 --> 11:33.669
and that's all he cares about.

11:33.752 --> 11:35.796
Men and power,
it's seriously a disease.

11:35.879 --> 11:38.215
I mean, superpowered man, but...

11:39.383 --> 11:41.760
Jess?

11:48.392 --> 11:49.685
Jess?

11:49.768 --> 11:52.062
Jess, are you okay?

11:52.145 --> 11:54.106
Yeah, I just thought I...

11:54.189 --> 11:56.024
saw someone I knew.

11:56.108 --> 11:58.819
Yeah, no Teen Choice Award for you.

11:58.902 --> 11:59.903
Talk.

12:00.779 --> 12:03.366
Kilgrave's been surveilling me.

12:03.449 --> 12:04.700
Taking pictures.

12:04.783 --> 12:06.410
- Why?
- I don't know.

12:06.494 --> 12:10.080
So he can record me imploding
as he tortures me?

12:10.914 --> 12:13.709
The spy could be anyone
or everyone.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.711
It's been going on for weeks.
I had no idea.

12:15.794 --> 12:18.046
Just breathe, okay?

12:18.130 --> 12:19.214
He isn't here now.

12:19.297 --> 12:21.467
Yeah, well, he's always here.

12:31.894 --> 12:34.605
<i>I don't need
reminders of what I did to Luke.</i>

12:37.608 --> 12:39.777
<i>Even if I had good intentions.</i>

12:40.861 --> 12:42.154
<i>Mostly.</i>

12:55.959 --> 12:58.170
Listen to me, Larry.
You are never gonna win this one.

12:58.253 --> 13:01.298
<i>Oh, are you a legislator now?
Are you gonna rewrite the patent law?</i>

13:01.381 --> 13:03.801
I'm not going to have to.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.595
Do you have any idea
how much people love their pets?

13:06.679 --> 13:11.725
Your clients poisoned their pets,
abusing manufacturing loopholes in China.

13:11.809 --> 13:13.686
You know who people hate
more than litigators?

13:13.769 --> 13:15.521
Puppy killers.

13:15.604 --> 13:16.897
<i>We can come in at half.</i>

13:16.980 --> 13:18.524
She won't wait.
She wouldn't listen.

13:18.607 --> 13:20.317
I couldn't hear you over that print.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.486
Larry, let me call you back.

13:22.570 --> 13:25.155
That was a potential
$50 million settlement.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.074
- Now I have to ramp him back up.
- Oops!

13:27.157 --> 13:29.535
I need to know if your firm
represents Audrey Eastman.

13:29.618 --> 13:31.411
She says she's with Desmond Tobey.

13:31.495 --> 13:33.456
Well, then you should be
invading Tobey's office.

13:33.539 --> 13:37.167
I did. Are "attorney-client privilege"
the only words that he knows?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.752
He wouldn't even tell me
if he referred her to me.

13:38.836 --> 13:40.420
What's going on?
You're on edge.

13:40.504 --> 13:44.174
The last people referred to me
wound up dead in my elevator.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.051
If Audrey Eastman follows the same path,

13:46.134 --> 13:47.774
she won't be able to pay her legal bills.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.388
She is a client, I'll confirm that.

13:50.473 --> 13:53.517
- And do you trust him? Tobey?
- He's a partner.

13:53.601 --> 13:54.977
That's not an answer.

13:55.644 --> 13:57.896
He's handling my own divorce,
so yes, I trust him.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.064
Okay, good,
that's all I need to know.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.398
You need to pull yourself together.

14:00.483 --> 14:03.193
You are coming across
distinctly paranoid.

14:04.487 --> 14:07.531
Everyone keeps saying that.
It's like a conspiracy.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.743
I'm working.

14:10.826 --> 14:14.204
- <i>What if the apology didn't work?</i>
- Then I'll deal with it.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.790
Look, I'm with a client right now.
Sort of.

14:16.874 --> 14:20.335
How can you trust any client after
what happened with Hope's parents?

14:20.418 --> 14:23.421
I don't, which is why I've been
following her since dawn.

14:23.506 --> 14:25.007
<i>Following who?</i>

14:25.966 --> 14:27.885
A jealous wife.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.971
Jess, come on,
I need the distraction.

14:31.054 --> 14:32.681
Fine.

14:32.765 --> 14:34.307
A jewelry designer.

14:34.391 --> 14:35.726
Audrey Eastman.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.352
Overpriced, chunky enamel stuff?

14:37.435 --> 14:40.438
Well, if she is mind-controlled,
that would explain some of her jewelry.

14:40.523 --> 14:41.732
It's not like she needs the money.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.609
Her parents died and left her a fortune,

14:43.692 --> 14:44.860
but all she does is work.

14:44.943 --> 14:47.988
Cheating husband...
She's compartmentalizing.

14:48.071 --> 14:51.992
- Useful skill.
<i>- How will you know if she's Kilgraved?</i>

14:52.075 --> 14:53.827
His effect has limits.

14:53.911 --> 14:57.665
<i>Right, time and distance.</i>

14:57.748 --> 14:59.500
But you can't follow her forever.

14:59.583 --> 15:02.961
<i>I've never seen his voodoo
last longer than 10 hours, 12 tops.</i>

15:03.712 --> 15:05.088
If he doesn't show soon, I'll...

15:05.756 --> 15:09.760
do the job and take pictures of the
cheater with his pants around his ankles.

15:13.972 --> 15:16.600
Nothing plays like pictures.

15:20.270 --> 15:21.313
Yeah?

15:21.396 --> 15:23.731
<i>You still wanna
help catch Kilgrave?</i>

15:23.816 --> 15:24.900
Yes.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.778
It's a little illegal.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.112
Answer's still yes.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.323
Can you get me
police surveillance video?

15:31.406 --> 15:33.576
<i>- Who you looking for?</i>
- Myself.

15:33.659 --> 15:37.454
Kilgrave's got somebody tailing me,
feeding him pictures.

15:37.538 --> 15:39.582
Police footage will show
who's around me.

15:39.665 --> 15:42.042
Yeah, well, we have cameras
all over the city.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.919
You got times, dates, locations?

15:44.002 --> 15:45.921
Texting them to you now.

15:46.004 --> 15:48.215
I got your six.

15:49.507 --> 15:51.801
"Got my six."

15:58.433 --> 15:59.642
It's an hour north of Rome.

15:59.727 --> 16:03.146
My sister said the views
from the hotel are amazing.

16:03.230 --> 16:07.109
Unbelievable. Two more walk-ins
because of that goddamn radio interview.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.902
Can I have my Jeri back, please?

16:09.695 --> 16:12.405
I would love to have lunch
without us bringing the office with us.

16:12.489 --> 16:15.117
I'm sorry. I'm here.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.243
And I promise you,

16:16.326 --> 16:19.580
after this circus is over,
I will take you anywhere you want to go.

16:19.663 --> 16:20.748
Okay.

16:22.124 --> 16:24.459
Oh, come on.

16:25.502 --> 16:27.295
Don't tell me you're bringing her here.

16:27.379 --> 16:28.672
We have a reservation.

16:28.756 --> 16:31.508
Wendy, you don't have exclusive rights
to every restaurant we've ever been to.

16:31.592 --> 16:33.010
Just the one where you proposed.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.848
You proposed to her here?
Jesus, Jeri.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.600
Did you forget?

16:39.683 --> 16:41.685
I didn't forget proposing, no.

16:42.310 --> 16:43.771
Well, that's worse for you than for me

16:43.854 --> 16:46.189
because it means she's fine
giving you leftover romance.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.941
- Let's just go somewhere else.
- No!

16:48.025 --> 16:51.737
If she orders you the tiramisu
and there is a diamond ring at the bottom,

16:51.820 --> 16:54.572
you'll think nothing could ever
make you stop feeling happy.

16:54.657 --> 16:55.783
Don't choke on it.

16:55.866 --> 16:59.327
You think, if you break us up,

16:59.411 --> 17:01.329
that I will crawl back to you?

17:01.413 --> 17:03.498
Read my face.
Never gonna happen.

17:11.799 --> 17:14.926
She does not get this goddamn restaurant.

17:15.010 --> 17:16.887
Yeah, she does.

17:23.101 --> 17:25.646
<i>If Audrey Eastman
is controlled by Kilgrave,</i>

17:25.729 --> 17:28.315
<i>it's going to wear off soon.</i>

17:28.397 --> 17:30.150
<i>He'll need to re-up.</i>

18:19.574 --> 18:20.909
Shit.

19:07.122 --> 19:10.125
<i>Thirteen hours and no Kilgrave, but...</i>

19:10.208 --> 19:13.461
<i>she's planning to use that
on someone.</i>

19:13.545 --> 19:15.297
<i>Maybe the wandering penis?</i>

19:29.269 --> 19:30.938
Name, address, daytime phone,

19:31.021 --> 19:34.191
medical history, including any visits
to a psychiatric facility.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.733
Next.

19:40.363 --> 19:43.116
<i>- Your text said it was urgent.
- It is.</i>

19:43.200 --> 19:45.535
Yet there's no gun to your head.
I don't like being summoned.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.788
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>
I have a job for you.

19:47.871 --> 19:48.914
Who are all these people?

19:48.997 --> 19:50.917
They claim they were
mind-controlled by Kilgrave.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.876
You should have seen
the ones we turned away.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.711
Maybe some of them are legit.

19:54.795 --> 19:56.213
Oh, please.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.925
That <i>Trish Talk</i> interview turned him
into the most popular alibi in the city.

20:00.008 --> 20:03.846
You bought Dr. Kurata's kidney story,
why not at least talk to them?

20:03.929 --> 20:05.806
Because I don't have time for this
right now.

20:05.889 --> 20:07.724
Because I have bigger problems, okay?

20:07.808 --> 20:12.645
Wendy has decided to make
this divorce very difficult for me,

20:12.729 --> 20:15.899
- and I need dirt on her.
- That's why you called me?

20:15.983 --> 20:18.193
I have a gun-toting client,
a spy to find...

20:18.276 --> 20:19.862
You owe me a favor.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.325
You were married to her.
You already have her dirt.

20:25.408 --> 20:26.534
She didn't know mine.

20:26.618 --> 20:29.121
Well, you're sneaky.
That doesn't mean she is.

20:29.204 --> 20:30.747
I didn't say it would be easy.

20:32.707 --> 20:33.875
God.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.836
Fine. Later.

20:36.794 --> 20:38.046
Who's first?

20:39.297 --> 20:40.841
Start at the beginning.

20:40.924 --> 20:44.761
I went into 7-Eleven for a bag of Doritos,
you know?

20:44.845 --> 20:49.975
And then this Chinese dude comes in,
and his eyes were all red and glowing,

20:50.058 --> 20:51.935
and I was like, "Dude."

20:52.019 --> 20:55.981
My Lucy is a nice girl. A virgin.

20:56.064 --> 20:59.484
Tell them. Go ahead.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.029
Kilgrave made me do it.

21:02.112 --> 21:03.405
He's our gardener.

21:03.488 --> 21:06.449
He landed on Jones Beach.
I thought it was a meteor.

21:06.533 --> 21:10.662
But then a man
came out of the waves...

21:12.205 --> 21:14.832
He lived with me for two days.

21:16.418 --> 21:19.754
He made me play my cello for him...

21:19.837 --> 21:21.423
until I made a mistake.

21:21.506 --> 21:23.091
He didn't even talk, man.

21:23.175 --> 21:27.845
He just, like, stared at me
with his freaky glowing eyes.

21:27.930 --> 21:31.766
I was like, "This dude is making
me wanna jack this place."

21:31.849 --> 21:33.435
I pulled out my gun...

21:33.518 --> 21:37.105
I couldn't stop smiling.
He wouldn't let me.

21:37.189 --> 21:40.108
He said, "You want me bad."

21:40.192 --> 21:42.819
And then I did want him... bad.

21:42.903 --> 21:46.448
And not just Lucy.
All the girls in the neighborhood.

21:46.531 --> 21:48.909
When he speaks,
they spread their legs.

21:48.992 --> 21:50.160
Evil man.

21:50.243 --> 21:53.288
He gave me a purple staff

21:53.371 --> 21:55.457
and made me slide it up my...

21:57.250 --> 21:58.376
He had dreads.

21:58.460 --> 21:59.461
Bald.

21:59.544 --> 22:00.753
Dark hair.

22:00.837 --> 22:02.589
He wore a white dress shirt...

22:02.672 --> 22:04.882
- Intense eyes.
- ...and a tie.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.469
A red T-shirt...

22:07.552 --> 22:08.636
I think.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.015
He never wears a shirt.
He's hot.

22:12.099 --> 22:15.852
I was waiting for the L train.

22:15.936 --> 22:21.774
And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.
You wanna give it to me, right?"

22:21.858 --> 22:24.694
And I said, "Yeah."

22:24.777 --> 22:26.446
And...

22:26.529 --> 22:30.075
like an asshole, I handed it over.

22:30.158 --> 22:34.329
Now, I know it's not the same
as killing my parents, but...

22:36.081 --> 22:37.957
it was Zegna.

22:38.041 --> 22:41.169
- That limey cocksucker owes me five grand.
- Limey?

22:41.253 --> 22:43.588
Yeah, he had an accent.
He's British.

22:43.671 --> 22:45.340
- Get up.
- I'm telling the truth.

22:45.423 --> 22:47.634
Get up.

23:00.022 --> 23:01.481
Put him on the list.

23:07.362 --> 23:09.156
Talk amongst yourselves.
Exchange info.

23:09.239 --> 23:10.240
Thanks.

23:12.242 --> 23:14.994
- What was that about?
- We're starting a band.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.248
I told them to keep in touch. Talk.

23:18.331 --> 23:21.668
You starting a support group?
Will you be participating?

23:21.751 --> 23:24.629
Like I'd waste my time circle jerking
with a bunch of whiners.

23:24.712 --> 23:27.382
Yes, you are a paragon of mental health.

23:31.261 --> 23:33.721
I'm using them, Hogarth.

23:33.805 --> 23:37.892
I wanna know everything they did with him,
everywhere they went,

23:37.975 --> 23:41.813
every word that was said,
particularly about me,

23:41.896 --> 23:44.023
and what the hell he's gonna do next.

23:44.107 --> 23:46.568
Kilgrave wanted a leather jacket,
live cello music,

23:46.651 --> 23:48.611
and the flattering smile
of a pretty girl.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.572
What a waste.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.699
He could solve so many problems
with his gift.

23:52.782 --> 23:53.991
Gift?

23:55.743 --> 23:58.288
I just meant, if...
if he was on our side.

23:58.371 --> 23:59.831
What side would that be?

24:00.665 --> 24:02.292
The side that uses people?

24:02.375 --> 24:03.668
Treats them like animals?

24:03.751 --> 24:04.877
Jessica, do not take this out on me.

24:04.961 --> 24:06.045
Just to throw them away
like garbage?

24:06.129 --> 24:09.048
The side that rips your life apart
and destroys you from the inside out?

24:09.132 --> 24:11.843
Whose side exactly would that be?

24:38.995 --> 24:40.538
Hey.

24:40.622 --> 24:42.124
Hey, I got your movie.

24:43.791 --> 24:46.711
It's 30 hours.
Cast of thousands.

24:46.794 --> 24:48.421
Thanks, I should've got some popcorn.

24:50.548 --> 24:55.387
Listen, there's a lot to comb through,
but your spy is in there somewhere.

24:55.470 --> 24:56.471
Hey!

24:56.554 --> 24:58.306
What are you looking at, huh?

24:58.390 --> 25:00.475
What the hell are you looking at, huh?

25:00.558 --> 25:02.101
- Hey, get off him!
- He's watching!

25:02.185 --> 25:03.895
Yeah, he's probably
watching the ceiling melt.

25:03.978 --> 25:05.772
He doesn't like me.

25:05.855 --> 25:07.857
Malcolm, go sleep it off.

25:12.904 --> 25:14.281
Hey, I got enough to deal with

25:14.364 --> 25:16.908
without worrying about you going all
search and destroy on me.

25:16.991 --> 25:18.535
I know, I am...

25:20.620 --> 25:22.247
I know how to turn it off, I...

25:22.330 --> 25:24.749
The paranoia and the panic, I just...

25:24.832 --> 25:26.251
Listen, there's this...

25:26.334 --> 25:28.253
group of people.

25:30.046 --> 25:33.841
They've all been through
the same thing, so...

25:33.925 --> 25:38.095
if you wanna talk or something,
they meet tomorrow night.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.848
Yeah, I'm not into it, either.

25:41.933 --> 25:43.393
I gotta go.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.837
God damn it.

26:16.218 --> 26:20.597
<i>Now I know how it feels,
someone watching your every move,</i>

26:20.680 --> 26:22.890
<i>seeing you in private moments.</i>

27:10.730 --> 27:11.939
Jessica.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.319
Are you Jessica?

27:18.029 --> 27:19.071
Yeah.

27:20.365 --> 27:21.908
Where are your parents?

27:21.991 --> 27:23.951
Patsy Walker is safe.

27:24.744 --> 27:25.870
What did you say?

27:25.953 --> 27:29.457
You don't have to worry about her,
for now.

27:30.667 --> 27:33.295
- Who told you that?
- The man.

27:33.378 --> 27:35.630
He said he liked her apology.

27:40.593 --> 27:41.803
How old are you?

27:41.886 --> 27:44.306
Eight and a half.

27:47.224 --> 27:49.185
I'm sorry that this is happening to you.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.645
You're a bitch.

27:50.728 --> 27:52.188
You could have stopped that bus.

27:52.271 --> 27:56.150
You left him there to die in the street,
like a goddamn dog.

27:56.233 --> 27:59.362
- Stop it.
- You turn everything to shit.

27:59.446 --> 28:00.447
Jesus!

28:00.530 --> 28:01.948
It's Friday.

28:03.825 --> 28:05.284
What does that mean?

28:05.368 --> 28:07.495
Don't you have a job to do?

28:08.746 --> 28:10.957
Are you talking about Audrey?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.793
Did Kilgrave send Audrey?

28:13.876 --> 28:15.211
Did he send Audrey?

28:15.294 --> 28:17.088
Was he at her target practice? Wait!

28:17.171 --> 28:18.506
Mommy!
Where's Mommy?

28:18.590 --> 28:20.310
It's okay.
I'm gonna help you find your mom.

28:20.383 --> 28:21.926
- Chanise!
- Mommy!

28:22.009 --> 28:24.178
- She won't let me go!
- Sorry! I'm sorry.

28:24.261 --> 28:25.888
Are you okay?
Did she hurt you, baby?

28:25.972 --> 28:27.765
She was lost.
I was just trying to help.

28:27.849 --> 28:29.559
Stay away from her!

28:47.910 --> 28:48.995
What are you doing here?

28:50.204 --> 28:53.625
I'm sorry to show up like this.
I just wanted to make this right.

28:56.127 --> 28:57.670
You can't.

28:57.754 --> 28:59.672
I got something for you.

29:00.548 --> 29:02.842
I don't want anything from you.

29:04.511 --> 29:07.389
Well, it might help. Please.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.225
Um...

29:13.395 --> 29:14.771
It's personal.

29:17.774 --> 29:19.484
I can't let you in.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.947
Put it on the floor.

29:31.829 --> 29:34.081
Now go to the end of the hall.

30:20.670 --> 30:24.256
Uh, did you open it?

30:24.340 --> 30:25.425
Yes.

30:28.886 --> 30:30.722
I just want you to feel safe.

30:34.350 --> 30:35.768
Is it legal?

30:37.479 --> 30:38.521
No.

30:47.363 --> 30:48.948
You still there?

31:04.881 --> 31:07.133
<i>Audrey was right
about her husband.</i>

31:07.216 --> 31:09.385
<i>Carlo's clearly
not in a hurry to get home.</i>

31:11.012 --> 31:13.848
<i>Cases like this
remind me of why I'm single.</i>

32:12.073 --> 32:15.242
<i>I could storm the gates
and get the money shot...</i>

32:16.869 --> 32:19.664
<i>but not if Kilgrave
got to Audrey somehow.</i>

32:44.647 --> 32:46.233
Shit.

33:43.831 --> 33:44.916
Hello?

33:44.999 --> 33:47.376
<i>Hi, it's Audrey Eastman.</i>

33:49.211 --> 33:50.755
Yeah, I know.

33:50.838 --> 33:52.548
<i>Did you follow him?</i>

33:55.092 --> 33:57.386
Wait, what?

33:57.469 --> 34:00.056
<i>Where are you?</i>

34:00.139 --> 34:01.724
<i>Jessica?</i>

34:01.808 --> 34:03.893
<i>Hello? Jessica?</i>

34:03.976 --> 34:05.311
Are you there?

34:07.063 --> 34:09.190
Jessica?

34:09.273 --> 34:10.440
Can you hear me?

34:11.650 --> 34:14.360
Where... Where is Carlo?

34:17.989 --> 34:19.867
He's three feet to your right, asshole.

34:21.953 --> 34:24.038
- Get her on the plastic!
- How?

34:24.121 --> 34:26.331
I have a gun on her,
for Christ's sake, Carlo.

34:26.415 --> 34:29.752
You shoot at me, I'll pull the bullet
out of my ruined jacket

34:29.835 --> 34:31.754
and shove it up your ass
with my pinky finger,

34:31.838 --> 34:33.558
and who do you think
that's gonna hurt more?

34:33.589 --> 34:34.590
You're bulletproof?

34:36.842 --> 34:39.846
- Jesus!
- Nope, not bulletproof.

34:39.929 --> 34:41.806
Audrey, this is insane.
Honey, we don't have to do this.

34:41.889 --> 34:43.056
We can walk out of here right now...

34:43.139 --> 34:45.141
She doesn't have laser eyes either,
or she would have used them.

34:45.226 --> 34:48.478
Laser eyes?
Who said I had laser eyes?

34:48.562 --> 34:51.858
Oh, that dick with the Aston Martin.
I served him a subpoena.

34:51.940 --> 34:55.695
Gregory Spheeris. I sell to his wife.
They're very talky.

34:55.777 --> 34:57.780
Look, you're obviously
pissed off about something,

34:57.864 --> 35:01.784
but I'm pretty sure, for the first time,
this has nothing to do with Kilgrave.

35:01.868 --> 35:03.327
He's smarter than you two.

35:03.410 --> 35:07.289
Kilgrave? Who's Kilgrave?
Is he another one of you people?

35:07.373 --> 35:09.208
How many more are there like you?

35:09.291 --> 35:11.335
How many more what, private eyes?

35:11.418 --> 35:12.712
"Gifted."

35:12.795 --> 35:15.172
Stupid word.

35:15.256 --> 35:19.301
It's like calling someone "special."
They're not special, they're retarded.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.595
You're not gifted,
you're a freak.

35:22.471 --> 35:25.016
What have we or the mentally challenged
ever done to you?

35:25.099 --> 35:27.894
You saved the city.

35:27.977 --> 35:31.605
That's what the newspapers said.
You were "heroes."

35:32.815 --> 35:33.941
Not me.

35:34.025 --> 35:35.692
"The city was saved."

35:35.777 --> 35:38.612
But I was there.
I saw what really happened.

35:38.695 --> 35:40.364
I saw my mother crushed to death

35:40.447 --> 35:42.491
under a building
that you people destroyed.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.868
In the incident?

35:43.951 --> 35:46.245
I was trying
to pull my mother out from the rubble,

35:46.328 --> 35:48.164
watching her bleed to death,

35:48.247 --> 35:51.708
while all around me,
you people were raining down hell.

35:51.793 --> 35:54.545
So go after the big green guy
or the flag waver.

35:54.628 --> 35:55.880
I wasn't even there!

35:55.963 --> 35:59.091
Consider it a preventative measure
for next time.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.262
You think you're the only ones
who've lost people?

36:03.345 --> 36:05.222
You think you're the only ones with pain?

36:06.098 --> 36:08.935
You think you can take your shit
and dump it on me?

36:10.602 --> 36:11.728
You don't get to do that!

36:11.813 --> 36:14.648
So you take your goddamn pain
and you live with it, assholes!

36:17.026 --> 36:20.446
You lost your parents?
Welcome to the goddamn club!

36:20.529 --> 36:22.782
I lost mine in some random accident.

36:22.865 --> 36:26.535
Do you see me trying to kill
every shitty driver? No!

36:26.618 --> 36:29.163
Because I don't work my shit out
on other people!

36:29.246 --> 36:33.209
So keep your goddamn feelings
to yourselves!

36:40.174 --> 36:41.592
Ninety-nine.

36:43.177 --> 36:46.097
You wanted to know
how many of us there are?

36:46.180 --> 36:48.349
The last time I counted,

36:48.432 --> 36:53.729
I had 99 gifted friends
in this borough alone.

36:54.396 --> 36:55.772
And now every single one of them

36:55.857 --> 36:59.068
is gonna know about this shit
that you tried to pull.

36:59.819 --> 37:02.696
And they hate attempted murder.

37:02.779 --> 37:04.448
They really do.

37:04.531 --> 37:09.370
The cops hate it, too, you know,
because it's against the law.

37:09.453 --> 37:11.913
Please don't kill us.
We're gonna leave you alone.

37:11.998 --> 37:14.279
There's only one thing
that you can do to save yourselves.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.128
- What?
- Disappear.

37:17.211 --> 37:22.341
Nobody, especially me,
ever hears from you again.

37:23.175 --> 37:28.097
Me and my friends will stop by tomorrow
to make sure you heard me.

37:33.060 --> 37:35.562
I want a divorce.

38:40.920 --> 38:45.257
<i>I couldn't stop smiling.
He wouldn't let me.</i>

38:57.603 --> 38:59.813
And this one guy

38:59.896 --> 39:05.152
stitched a silhouette of my hair
in orange sequins.

39:05.236 --> 39:08.280
And this girl sent me a stuffed, uh...

39:09.823 --> 39:12.659
It kind of looked like a voodoo doll.

39:12.743 --> 39:15.371
Of you?

39:15.454 --> 39:18.332
Me or Carrot Top.
It wasn't clear.

39:18.415 --> 39:21.877
It's creepy.

39:21.961 --> 39:24.421
Well, it seemed normal at the time.

39:25.422 --> 39:30.302
My mother had been
marketing the Patsy dolls for years, so...

39:31.762 --> 39:33.472
Uh...

39:33.555 --> 39:36.433
The whole thing's
a little embarrassing now.

39:40.229 --> 39:42.273
I had G.I. Joes...

39:42.356 --> 39:43.815
till they all burned.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.153
Burned?

39:47.236 --> 39:49.696
They went into battle
to save my sister's Barbie

39:49.780 --> 39:52.449
and melted into one big clump.

39:53.409 --> 39:55.161
That's terrible.

39:55.244 --> 39:57.954
Hey! They accomplished their mission.

39:58.039 --> 40:01.708
- By dying?
- They rescued Barbie.

40:01.792 --> 40:05.587
I mean, the Dream House was gutted,
but she had insurance.

40:05.671 --> 40:08.299
You used actual fire?

40:08.382 --> 40:10.426
You torched a Dream House?

40:10.509 --> 40:13.345
I was committed to the scenario.

40:13.429 --> 40:15.181
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

40:17.183 --> 40:21.603
That was meant to be a story about how
I've always been the guy saving people.

40:21.687 --> 40:24.523
Albeit plastic people and they melted.

40:24.606 --> 40:27.859
Well, I just need you to know that.

40:27.943 --> 40:30.279
The guy who tried to kill you...

40:32.781 --> 40:34.283
it wasn't me.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.582
I don't blame you.

40:41.665 --> 40:44.668
Well, you're doing better than me.

40:44.751 --> 40:47.504
I tried to fight it.

40:47.588 --> 40:48.880
I couldn't.

40:50.049 --> 40:51.967
Hey, listen.

40:52.051 --> 40:55.096
What Kilgrave did to you,
he did to Jessica.

40:56.930 --> 40:59.516
It doesn't matter how strong you are.

41:02.686 --> 41:05.939
Maybe not,
but we can protect ourselves.

41:13.072 --> 41:14.698
Trish?

41:19.911 --> 41:22.206
I might shoot you by accident.

41:23.207 --> 41:25.000
It's worth the risk.

42:16.260 --> 42:19.388
- You went back to work?
- I had to.

42:19.471 --> 42:23.975
- I needed things to feel normal again.
- Yeah, so did I.

42:24.059 --> 42:25.602
Ah, you're a New York City cop.

42:25.686 --> 42:30.232
I'm sure your "normal"
is pretty crazy to begin with.

42:30.316 --> 42:32.818
Unlike being an actress.

42:32.901 --> 42:34.736
Completely sane profession.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.738
Yeah.

42:42.578 --> 42:43.620
Hogarth.

42:43.704 --> 42:46.207
<i>I sent more potential victims
to your survivor's group.</i>

42:46.290 --> 42:47.833
It's not my survivor's group.

42:47.916 --> 42:51.295
<i>Maybe it should be.
You need to process your trauma.</i>

42:51.378 --> 42:52.421
I'm sorry, who is this?

42:52.504 --> 42:56.717
<i>Fine. You need to not take
your crap out on my glass walls.</i>

42:56.800 --> 42:57.801
Put it on my tab.

42:57.884 --> 43:00.429
<i>When are you planning to pay that off?</i>

43:00.512 --> 43:03.390
Not tonight, Hogarth.
Not tonight.

43:05.642 --> 43:10.231
Avery was crying because I forgot
to put his action figures in the car.

43:10.314 --> 43:14.860
He'd been fussy all morning,
and in the car, he was just impossible.

43:14.943 --> 43:16.778
I lost my temper.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.947
Then we hit a red light
just south of Herald Square,

43:19.030 --> 43:22.701
and Kilgrave just opened the door
and got in.

43:22.784 --> 43:26.330
Said he liked my car,
wanted to ride around.

43:28.957 --> 43:31.335
Avery was still crying,

43:31.418 --> 43:33.837
but Kilgrave never once looked at him.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.590
He just stared straight ahead and said...

43:37.633 --> 43:41.136
"You'd like to leave your son,
wouldn't you?"

43:41.220 --> 43:43.430
And I said yes.

43:43.514 --> 43:47.476
I pulled Avery out, put him on the curb,
and drove away.

43:49.185 --> 43:53.315
I saw him in my rear-view mirror,
just weeping on the sidewalk,

43:53.399 --> 43:56.860
and I hated myself because...
it's what I wanted.

43:58.945 --> 44:02.908
I disappeared for a week
while I was Kilgrave's chauffeur.

44:04.618 --> 44:07.704
I was charged with child abandonment.

44:07.788 --> 44:11.292
My wife left me, which
I don't blame her, because...

44:11.375 --> 44:13.669
You drove him for a week?

44:13.752 --> 44:15.421
24/7?

44:15.504 --> 44:17.673
Yeah, it was a nightmare.
I was haunted by...

44:17.756 --> 44:18.924
Where did you drive him?

44:19.007 --> 44:21.843
- I'm not sure that's the...
- Did he meet anyone in particular?

44:21.927 --> 44:23.679
Did anyone deliver pictures to him?

44:23.762 --> 44:25.347
- Um, actually, yeah.
- Who?

44:26.265 --> 44:28.850
I don't know, I just had to drive Kilgrave
to meet the same guy

44:28.934 --> 44:30.477
every day at 10:00 a.m. on the dot.

44:30.561 --> 44:32.187
- He was very punctual.
- What did he look like?

44:32.271 --> 44:34.273
Is this some kind of
reenactment therapy?

44:34.356 --> 44:36.900
Screw therapy.
What did he look like, the guy he met?

44:36.983 --> 44:40.236
Well, I never got close,
and it was freezing.

44:40.321 --> 44:42.906
Everyone's wrapped
in tons of layers and hats.

44:42.989 --> 44:45.158
He wore a scarf.

44:45.241 --> 44:46.785
Blue and white stripes.
