01:03.120 --> 01:04.654
<i>GIRL:
Kahlan.</i>

01:40.521 --> 01:42.895
Kahlan Amnell.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.020
Soon you'll be the last
of your kind.

01:54.165 --> 01:55.162
What's wrong?

01:55.287 --> 01:58.162
Nothing.
It was just a bad dream.

01:58.287 --> 01:59.621
Tell me about it.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.020
I was in a desert.

02:04.488 --> 02:05.663
There was a bird

02:05.788 --> 02:08.363
and a blind girl.

02:08.488 --> 02:11.829
A Starless Blackbird of Caska.

02:11.954 --> 02:13.895
I'm trying to sleep here.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.221
That wasn't any ordinary dream.
That was a message.

02:17.688 --> 02:19.563
It belongs
to a Dream Caster.

02:19.688 --> 02:23.162
A magical clan of nomads living
in a desert far away from here.

02:23.287 --> 02:27.762
Every generation, a blackbird
befriends a small child.

02:27.887 --> 02:30.829
That child is then recognized
as the high priestess

02:30.954 --> 02:34.363
and has the power to send dreams
on the wings of birds.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.096
The girl in my dream,

02:37.221 --> 02:40.429
she told me soon I would
be the last of my kind.

02:40.554 --> 02:41.962
It could be a warning

02:42.087 --> 02:44.096
that the line of Confessors
is in danger.

02:44.221 --> 02:47.096
I have to go to Valeria,

02:47.221 --> 02:48.630
make sure my sister's safe.

02:48.755 --> 02:51.196
Valeria? That's hundreds
of leagues from here.

02:51.321 --> 02:53.129
RICHARD:
You can't travel alone.

02:53.254 --> 02:55.096
I'll go with you.

02:55.221 --> 02:58.396
I thought there was nothing
more important than taking him

02:58.521 --> 03:02.229
and this magic rune to Pamorah
to find the Stone of Tears.

03:02.354 --> 03:04.630
Zedd, you go on
with Cara and Flynn.

03:04.755 --> 03:06.496
We'll catch up with you
as soon as we can.

03:06.621 --> 03:07.887
It's a waste of time.

03:09.887 --> 03:11.187
Why do you say that?

03:13.121 --> 03:15.020
The Confessors living
on Valeria are dead.

03:17.421 --> 03:19.129
When Darken Rahl found out

03:19.254 --> 03:21.096
there was a male Confessor
living on Valeria,

03:21.221 --> 03:23.062
he ordered us
to bring him the child,

03:23.187 --> 03:24.996
but when we
stormed the island

03:25.121 --> 03:27.621
the mother sacrificed the baby
so we couldn't take it.

03:30.354 --> 03:31.630
And the mother?

03:31.755 --> 03:34.829
She was eliminated.
KAHLAN: My sister?

03:34.954 --> 03:37.096
Dennee is dead?

03:37.221 --> 03:39.895
There was no pain.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.688
I killed her swiftly.

03:43.721 --> 03:44.895
Kahlan?

03:45.020 --> 03:47.096
What's happening to her?
It's the Con Dar.

03:47.221 --> 03:48.762
Kahlan.
ZEDD: Stay back!

03:48.887 --> 03:50.129
Cara, you have
to leave now!

03:50.254 --> 03:52.187
I only did
what I was ordered to.

04:01.887 --> 04:03.996
I can't hold her
much longer. Run!

04:04.121 --> 04:05.196
But I swore to serve you.

04:05.321 --> 04:06.762
RICHARD:
That isn't possible anymore.

04:06.887 --> 04:08.421
Get out of here now!

04:16.353 --> 04:18.821
RICHARD:
Are you all right?

04:20.019 --> 04:22.087
You shouldn't have stopped me.

04:23.654 --> 04:24.962
RICHARD:
You were in the Con Dar.

04:25.087 --> 04:28.563
Killing Cara out of vengeance
wouldn't help you,

04:28.688 --> 04:30.062
only the Keeper.

04:30.187 --> 04:33.062
Richard, this isn't
about vengeance.

04:33.187 --> 04:38.296
She's a Mord-Sith,
trained to torture and kill.

04:38.421 --> 04:41.929
Who knows where she'll go
or what she'll do now.

04:42.054 --> 04:44.396
I have to find her
and stop her.

04:44.521 --> 04:47.129
We have a small problem.
What is it?

04:47.254 --> 04:49.129
Flynn has gone.
What?

04:49.254 --> 04:50.829
Only a momentary setback.

04:50.954 --> 04:52.696
I was afraid the scamp
might up and leave,

04:52.821 --> 04:54.596
so I took precautions.

04:54.721 --> 04:57.187
Magical precautions.

05:01.788 --> 05:03.596
You spelled his shoes.

05:03.721 --> 05:06.388
All we have to do
is follow his footsteps.

05:10.454 --> 05:12.463
If we don't find Flynn
and get the Stone of Tears,

05:12.588 --> 05:14.630
the Keeper will to destroy
every living thing.

05:14.755 --> 05:17.554
So you can come with us...

05:20.287 --> 05:21.821
Or you can go after Cara.

05:30.421 --> 05:32.755
If I ever see her again,
I'll kill her.

05:56.054 --> 05:57.987
MAN:
She's a Mord-Sith.

06:09.755 --> 06:13.196
Please, we don't
want any trouble.

06:13.321 --> 06:15.621
All I want is a room
and a hot meal.

06:21.588 --> 06:24.721
And maybe something
a little sweet.

06:42.954 --> 06:46.463
It's much too early for this.

06:46.588 --> 06:49.221
We don't want your kind here.

07:03.521 --> 07:06.730
BARKEEP:
Nobody wants you.

07:06.855 --> 07:08.529
Why don't you get out
of my tavern

07:08.654 --> 07:11.688
and go back to whatever vile pit
you crawled out of?

07:30.154 --> 07:33.187
Looks like someone stopped
for a nap.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.855
Good morning, princess.

07:50.221 --> 07:52.962
"Figured you wouldn't use magic
on me because of the rune,

07:53.087 --> 07:56.596
"but just in case you spelled
my clothes and shoes,

07:56.721 --> 07:58.463
"I've left them behind.

07:58.588 --> 08:01.263
"Good luck finding
that Stone of Tears.

08:01.388 --> 08:04.129
Your biggest admirer,
Flynn."

08:04.254 --> 08:06.496
He's clever,
I'll give him that.

08:06.621 --> 08:07.862
He's also naked.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.154
How far can he get?

08:30.887 --> 08:32.821
Ella!

08:35.453 --> 08:38.828
MAN:
Get away from my daughter.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.895
It's all right.
Mama's here.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.821
I'm not here to hurt anybody.

08:46.454 --> 08:49.755
Then leave, now, before I put
this arrow through your eye.

08:53.654 --> 08:56.221
Wait.
Grace, stay away from her.

09:00.654 --> 09:02.855
Cara?

09:08.554 --> 09:11.529
Yes.
You know her?

09:11.654 --> 09:13.230
She's my sister.

09:13.355 --> 09:14.355
+

09:25.348 --> 09:26.914
Please, wait.

09:32.981 --> 09:34.624
I'm sorry about my husband.

09:34.749 --> 09:36.590
He was only trying
to protect our daughter.

09:36.715 --> 09:38.023
There's no need to explain.

09:38.148 --> 09:40.148
I can't believe it's you.

09:43.548 --> 09:45.749
It was a mistake
for me to come here.

09:47.415 --> 09:49.490
No, please.

09:49.615 --> 09:52.023
You look so tired and hungry.

09:52.148 --> 09:54.115
At least let me give you
something to eat.

09:59.148 --> 10:00.382
Could you do me one favor?

10:01.881 --> 10:04.357
Your leather will terrify the
children.

10:04.482 --> 10:06.382
Would you mind changing?

10:11.315 --> 10:13.181
This should fit.

10:18.548 --> 10:20.590
Remember when we were little
and Mother made us

10:20.715 --> 10:22.956
those matching dresses?

10:23.081 --> 10:24.382
Where is our mother?

10:25.682 --> 10:27.856
After you were taken,

10:27.981 --> 10:29.715
the worry and grief
made her sick.

10:31.148 --> 10:32.823
When the Mord-Sith
came back and took Father,

10:32.948 --> 10:35.914
it was too much.
Her heart gave out.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.914
Do you know
what happened to Father?

10:46.548 --> 10:47.881
You don't want to know.

10:53.615 --> 10:54.914
Well...

10:57.181 --> 10:58.715
I'll let you change.

11:09.582 --> 11:11.290
<i>MOTHER:
Hold still, Cara.</i>

11:11.415 --> 11:12.856
Is it almost done?

11:12.981 --> 11:14.281
Almost.

11:16.782 --> 11:19.515
Wait till your father sees
how pretty you look.

11:39.849 --> 11:41.582
You wear it much better
than I do.

11:52.749 --> 11:56.215
Ella, pass Cara the potatoes.

12:04.048 --> 12:05.390
Don't move!

12:05.515 --> 12:06.923
MAN:
Don't move!

12:07.048 --> 12:08.423
Her weapons are in the bedroom.

12:08.548 --> 12:10.823
Sirian? Why?

12:10.948 --> 12:13.457
Your husband did
the right thing.

12:13.582 --> 12:16.357
I know how badly you want
to believe she's your sister,

12:16.482 --> 12:18.223
but she's a Mord-Sith.

12:18.348 --> 12:20.048
Your sister's never coming back.

12:24.749 --> 12:26.490
<i>ZEDD:
We're looking for a young man</i>

12:26.615 --> 12:28.190
<i>with hair the color of sand,</i>

12:28.315 --> 12:30.724
blue eyes,
about this tall,

12:30.849 --> 12:33.090
and a swelled head
about so big.

12:33.215 --> 12:35.856
Heh. A local tailor
found him half-naked

12:35.981 --> 12:37.856
in his shop
a couple nights ago,

12:37.981 --> 12:39.523
stealing clothes.

12:39.648 --> 12:42.056
By the time we got there,
he was gone.

12:42.181 --> 12:44.823
Do you have any idea what
direction he might be headed?

12:44.948 --> 12:47.490
Well, Black Arrow's Point
is only a day's journey.

12:47.615 --> 12:48.889
It's a rich town.

12:49.014 --> 12:50.648
If I were a thief,
that's where I'd go.

12:54.849 --> 12:55.956
Mother Confessor?

12:56.081 --> 12:57.515
Yes?

12:59.215 --> 13:02.323
Please excuse
my ill-mannered interruption.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.590
I've been searching
for you for days.

13:04.715 --> 13:06.956
I bring an urgent message
from the people of Stowecroft.

13:07.081 --> 13:08.490
What is it?

13:08.615 --> 13:11.290
We've arrested a Mord-Sith.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.115
We need you to execute her.

13:15.815 --> 13:18.923
KAHLAN:
You don't need me to find Flynn.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.090
I'm going to Stowecroft.

13:21.215 --> 13:24.014
Since when is the Mother
Confessor an executioner?

13:26.582 --> 13:27.657
If they want Cara dead,

13:27.782 --> 13:29.190
why don't they just
do it themselves?

13:29.315 --> 13:32.315
Because they've condemned her to
the harshest fate possible...

13:34.248 --> 13:37.123
Death by confession.

13:37.248 --> 13:39.215
What do you mean?

13:44.382 --> 13:47.457
Confession works differently
on Mord-Sith.

13:47.582 --> 13:49.990
Once touched, they suffer
in agony until they die.

13:50.115 --> 13:51.724
So they don't just
want to execute her,

13:51.849 --> 13:53.257
they want to make her suffer.

13:53.382 --> 13:54.624
They want to make an example.

13:54.749 --> 13:57.223
This isn't right.
The people deserve justice.

13:57.348 --> 13:59.023
Captain Arturis said
that the Mord-Sith

13:59.148 --> 14:01.457
have been stealing little girls
from their town for years.

14:01.582 --> 14:02.956
And we'll find a way
to stop that,

14:03.081 --> 14:05.090
but it sounds like these people
want to punish Cara

14:05.215 --> 14:07.690
for every bad thing
the Mord-Sith have ever done.

14:07.815 --> 14:09.789
Richard,
she killed my sister.

14:09.914 --> 14:11.823
And I am so sorry for that,

14:11.948 --> 14:14.523
but that is exactly why you
can't be fair about this.

14:14.648 --> 14:16.690
You've already accused me
of wanting vengeance.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.257
This is different.
It's the will of the people.

14:19.382 --> 14:21.348
You say it's the will
of the people?

14:24.348 --> 14:26.590
Then if I can prove
to them that Cara's

14:26.715 --> 14:28.923
not the monster
they think she is,

14:29.048 --> 14:30.315
will you spare her life?

14:36.881 --> 14:38.956
What is it about this woman

14:39.081 --> 14:41.648
that makes you always want
to come to her rescue?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.415
I believe people can change.

14:54.382 --> 14:56.415
MAN:
Rot in the Underworld.

15:03.315 --> 15:05.014
Here, drink this.

15:12.615 --> 15:15.281
Drop it!

15:18.981 --> 15:20.690
Are you hurt?

15:20.815 --> 15:23.690
It takes more than a few stones
to break a Mord-Sith.

15:23.815 --> 15:25.523
Take her out of the stocks,
put her in jail.

15:25.648 --> 15:31.523
Come to get your revenge,
is that it, Mother Confessor?

15:31.648 --> 15:34.048
Get her out of my sight.

15:35.515 --> 15:36.756
Don't fight.

15:36.881 --> 15:38.181
I'm going to get
you out of this.

15:42.582 --> 15:43.923
Before her sentence
is carried out,

15:44.048 --> 15:45.889
the Seeker has requested
to speak on her behalf.

15:46.014 --> 15:48.257
We asked you to come here
to execute her.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.523
ALL: Yeah.
I'm not an executioner,

15:50.648 --> 15:53.056
I'm the Mother Confessor.

15:53.181 --> 15:55.582
And before her fate is decided,
there will be a hearing.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.690
And who will decide what happens
to her after this hearing?

15:59.815 --> 16:02.756
You? The Seeker?

16:02.881 --> 16:04.823
The decision will be left
to three of your town's

16:04.948 --> 16:06.257
most fair-minded elders.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.515
And if the elders
still want her dead?

16:13.948 --> 16:15.482
Then I will carry out
their wishes.

16:15.483 --> 16:16.483
+

16:26.166 --> 16:28.206
Hey!
Oh. Sorry, sir.

16:28.331 --> 16:30.166
It's fine, it's fine.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.565
Oh, my mistake.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.007
Here you are, sir.

16:45.132 --> 16:47.607
Oh. Why--
Why thank you, young man.

16:47.732 --> 16:50.540
But I seem to have lost
my coin purse as well.

16:50.665 --> 16:52.007
Perhaps you've seen it?
Sorry, sir,

16:52.132 --> 16:53.565
all I saw
was the handkerchief.

16:57.498 --> 17:00.074
Why are you wasting time
picking pockets

17:00.199 --> 17:01.874
when there's real coin
to be made with this?

17:01.999 --> 17:04.507
What, this? It's just
an old prison tattoo.

17:04.632 --> 17:08.999
Oh. Either you're lying
or you're stupid.

17:10.865 --> 17:12.940
The rune on your hand
is a key

17:13.065 --> 17:16.272
to one of the most precious
objects in the world:

17:16.397 --> 17:17.674
The Stone of Tears.

17:17.799 --> 17:19.973
Oh, yeah?
What do you know about it?

17:20.098 --> 17:22.272
Oh, I happen to know
a thing or two

17:22.397 --> 17:23.874
about priceless artifacts.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.173
Now, do you know
what you have to do

17:26.298 --> 17:27.607
once you get to Pamorah?

17:27.732 --> 17:29.206
No, why don't you tell me?

17:29.331 --> 17:31.607
Oh, no, no, no.

17:31.732 --> 17:33.473
I have another idea.

17:33.598 --> 17:35.340
We go to Pamorah together.

17:35.465 --> 17:38.206
We get the Stone of Tears
and we split the profits.

17:38.331 --> 17:40.698
And what if I don't
like that idea?

17:41.999 --> 17:44.540
Oh, well,
then here's another.

17:44.665 --> 17:47.607
Excuse me, madam, but have
you seen the local constable?

17:47.732 --> 17:50.007
I hear there's
a pickpocket about.

17:50.132 --> 17:52.732
All right. All right,
you made your point.

17:54.465 --> 17:56.340
No matter what you say,
they're going to kill me.

17:56.465 --> 17:58.407
Not if I can
show them the truth.

17:58.532 --> 18:00.206
What truth is that?

18:00.331 --> 18:01.707
That you're
a different person now

18:01.832 --> 18:03.273
than you were
under Darken Rahl.

18:03.398 --> 18:06.074
That you yourself are a victim
of the Mord-Sith.

18:06.199 --> 18:07.774
That's absurd.

18:07.899 --> 18:09.907
Cara, I spent time
in a Mord-Sith temple.

18:10.032 --> 18:12.099
I know what they do
to break people.

18:13.899 --> 18:15.907
You think because you
were poked a few times

18:16.032 --> 18:18.065
with an Agiel
you know anything about me?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.141
Being chosen by the Mord-Sith

18:21.266 --> 18:23.340
was the highest honor
of my life.

18:23.465 --> 18:26.206
Your pride is going
to get you killed.

18:26.331 --> 18:31.373
I'd rather die than grovel
on my knees and beg for mercy.

18:31.498 --> 18:35.306
Unless that's an order,
Lord Rahl?

18:35.431 --> 18:38.041
I'm not the Lord Rahl.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.707
And I'm not ashamed
of who I am.

18:40.832 --> 18:42.340
What did you think
was going to happen

18:42.465 --> 18:43.640
when you came back here?

18:43.765 --> 18:45.807
That they were going
to welcome you with open arms?

18:45.932 --> 18:47.607
You sent me away.

18:47.732 --> 18:49.465
I didn't know where else to go.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.999
Is there anyone here who would
speak on your behalf?

18:59.965 --> 19:01.431
Maybe my sister.

19:05.565 --> 19:07.573
RICHARD:
Because of this woman,

19:07.698 --> 19:10.340
all of you here are free
from Darken Rahl.

19:10.465 --> 19:12.540
I couldn't have defeated him
without her help.

19:12.665 --> 19:14.540
Before you condemn her to death,

19:14.665 --> 19:16.874
I only ask that you
listen to the story

19:16.999 --> 19:18.665
of how she
became what she is.

19:19.999 --> 19:22.473
Mord-Sith are not born,
they are broken.

19:22.598 --> 19:25.473
Every one of them starts out
as an innocent little girl

19:25.598 --> 19:28.232
and Cara was no different.

19:29.565 --> 19:31.398
Grace, tell us about
the day Cara was taken.

19:42.498 --> 19:44.640
We were fishing
with our father.

19:44.765 --> 19:46.765
I-I was 12.

19:49.199 --> 19:50.507
<i>Cara was 9.</i>

19:50.632 --> 19:52.107
GRACE:
I got one, I got one.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.007
All right, let me show
you how to haul it in

19:54.132 --> 19:56.540
so you won't lose it.

19:56.665 --> 19:58.598
GRACE:
Look!

20:01.065 --> 20:02.740
What kind of fish is it,
Father?

20:02.865 --> 20:05.732
I'm not sure.
What do you think, Cara?

20:09.565 --> 20:12.507
It's a baby fish.

20:12.632 --> 20:15.965
You think we should put it back
in the water so it can grow up?

20:17.365 --> 20:19.141
<i>GRACE:
She was so sweet.</i>

20:19.266 --> 20:22.232
She couldn't even
kill a fish.

20:24.032 --> 20:25.598
And then what happened?

20:27.632 --> 20:28.765
They came.

20:36.199 --> 20:39.099
BOTH: Father!

20:40.498 --> 20:42.298
Father!

20:44.932 --> 20:47.440
GRACE:
Cara!

20:47.565 --> 20:49.273
Cara!

20:49.398 --> 20:53.041
<i>GRACE:
That was the last time
I saw my sister.</i>

20:53.166 --> 20:56.640
A few days later, they came
back and took our father.

20:56.765 --> 21:00.099
I never understood why.

21:01.331 --> 21:02.740
Not a day goes by
that I don't think

21:02.865 --> 21:04.640
of my family
and miss them.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.107
That my father
could have lived

21:07.232 --> 21:10.573
to have seen
his grandchildren,

21:10.698 --> 21:12.141
take them fishing.

21:12.266 --> 21:16.166
He wasn't the kind,
caring man you think he was.

21:17.732 --> 21:21.507
He was a gutless,
selfish,

21:21.632 --> 21:23.373
pathetically weak bastard.

21:23.498 --> 21:26.740
How can you say such things?

21:26.865 --> 21:28.607
Because it's the truth.

21:28.732 --> 21:30.632
He deserved what he got.

21:32.365 --> 21:35.273
Did they--?

21:35.398 --> 21:36.665
Did they kill him?

21:38.532 --> 21:39.765
No.

21:41.732 --> 21:42.841
I did.

21:42.966 --> 21:43.966
+

21:48.914 --> 21:50.856
She is boasting about
murdering her own father.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.182
What more do you
need to hear?

21:53.307 --> 21:54.615
Why she did it.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.449
What the Mord-Sith
did to make her do it,

21:56.574 --> 21:58.648
because an innocent little girl
doesn't just turn

21:58.773 --> 22:00.116
into a killer for no reason.

22:00.241 --> 22:01.615
Mother Confessor,

22:01.940 --> 22:03.649
you are forcing
the people of this town

22:03.774 --> 22:05.715
to relive terrible days.
And for what purpose?

22:05.840 --> 22:07.949
So she can mock us?

22:08.074 --> 22:10.782
It's false pride, she's covering
how she really feels, I'm sure.

22:10.907 --> 22:12.649
No one has to sit and listen

22:12.774 --> 22:14.815
if they don't want to.

22:14.940 --> 22:16.207
The hearing will continue.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.149
Thank you.
He's right, Richard.

22:25.274 --> 22:27.249
You're putting
the people of this town

22:27.374 --> 22:28.907
through a great deal
of heartache.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.907
I hope it's worth it.

22:34.907 --> 22:37.316
<i>RICHARD:
I was once captured and
tortured by the Mord-Sith.</i>

22:37.441 --> 22:39.848
And this is what they
tormented me with,

22:39.973 --> 22:41.982
the Agiel.

22:42.107 --> 22:43.516
It causes
unimaginable pain.

22:43.641 --> 22:46.915
I can only hold it because
I was tortured with one.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.382
Is there anyone in the hall

22:48.507 --> 22:50.907
brave enough
to feel its effects?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.649
I will.

22:56.774 --> 22:57.949
Sirian.

22:58.074 --> 22:59.583
I have to warn you,

22:59.708 --> 23:01.349
this is going to hurt
worse than anything

23:01.474 --> 23:02.882
you've ever felt
in your life.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.274
You'll only be proving
what beasts the Mord-Sith are.

23:14.341 --> 23:17.049
They used this on Cara
to train her.

23:17.174 --> 23:19.216
And she was
a 9-year-old girl.

23:19.341 --> 23:21.416
Tell us what happened when
you were first captured.

23:21.541 --> 23:26.907
I was taught strength
and endurance.

23:30.207 --> 23:33.907
Please. I want my mother.

23:35.541 --> 23:36.949
<i>CARA:
When I was awake,</i>

23:37.074 --> 23:39.115
<i>I was beaten with the Agiel,</i>

23:39.240 --> 23:41.449
and when I tried to sleep,

23:41.574 --> 23:43.307
the rats gnawed
on my fingers and toes.

23:45.107 --> 23:46.915
<i>Even when I slept in a ball,</i>

23:47.040 --> 23:48.482
they'd feast on my ears.

23:48.607 --> 23:49.815
How long did that go on?

23:49.940 --> 23:52.382
Not very.

23:52.507 --> 23:54.616
The Mord-Sith
gave me the opportunity

23:54.741 --> 23:56.474
to kill my tormentors.

23:58.207 --> 24:02.149
NATHAIR:
You don't have to suffer these
little beasts any longer, Cara.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.282
If you wanna
get rid of them,

24:03.407 --> 24:05.074
all you have to do
is kill them.

24:07.574 --> 24:10.982
I don't wanna
kill anything.

24:11.107 --> 24:13.174
NATHAIR:
Would you rather
they kill you?

24:14.641 --> 24:17.982
Then listen
to me carefully, Cara.

24:18.107 --> 24:20.882
In this world,
it is kill or be killed.

24:21.007 --> 24:24.349
If you want to die the death
of a thousand little nibbles,

24:24.474 --> 24:26.082
that is your
decision to make,

24:26.207 --> 24:29.115
but if you consider your life
more important than a rat's,

24:29.240 --> 24:32.741
then you must kill them.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.349
<i>CARA:
It took me some time
to find the courage</i>

24:40.474 --> 24:42.808
<i>to learn to withstand
the pain of the Agiel...</i>

24:44.341 --> 24:46.349
...but in the end,

24:46.474 --> 24:50.040
I killed every rat
in that cell.

24:51.674 --> 24:54.216
Cara, no one can blame you
for killing the rats.

24:54.341 --> 24:56.882
Under those circumstances,
who wouldn't get rid of them?

24:57.007 --> 24:59.416
But your own father?

24:59.541 --> 25:01.182
What did they do
to make you kill him?

25:01.307 --> 25:03.316
They didn't force me to do it.

25:03.441 --> 25:05.782
They gave me the honor.

25:05.907 --> 25:08.049
NATHAIR:
Cara.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.541
Look who's come
to see you.

25:12.107 --> 25:15.848
Father! Please,
take me away from here.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.915
NATHAIR:
No, no, Cara.
He didn't come to rescue you.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.748
He came to sell
your sister to us.

25:21.873 --> 25:23.149
You're lying.

25:23.274 --> 25:25.216
My father wouldn't do that.

25:25.341 --> 25:27.149
NATHAIR:
How do you think
we found you?

25:27.274 --> 25:29.449
He told us exactly
where you'd be fishing.

25:29.574 --> 25:31.848
We paid him handsomely
for his little girl,

25:31.973 --> 25:33.748
and now he wants
to sell us the other one.

25:33.873 --> 25:37.474
If you don't believe me,
ask him yourself.

25:39.441 --> 25:40.873
Father?

25:44.574 --> 25:46.107
Tell your daughter
what you did.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.182
Look at him, Cara.

25:51.307 --> 25:54.015
He's so ashamed, he can't even
bring himself to say it.

25:54.140 --> 25:56.708
He sold you.

26:05.407 --> 26:08.249
NATHAIR:
I know this hurts, Cara,

26:08.374 --> 26:11.616
but now you see how ugly
common families are.

26:11.741 --> 26:15.249
They betray each other because
they're greedy and weak.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.782
But now you have
the Mord-Sith.

26:17.907 --> 26:20.015
We're your true
family now, Cara.

26:20.140 --> 26:22.216
We love you so much.

26:22.341 --> 26:24.616
We'll even give you the honor
of killing the monster

26:24.741 --> 26:26.708
who betrayed you.

26:29.774 --> 26:32.115
<i>CARA:
They put the Agiel in my hand,</i>

26:32.240 --> 26:35.240
and I killed him.

26:41.341 --> 26:43.115
What they did to you...

26:43.240 --> 26:45.649
Made me powerful.

26:45.774 --> 26:47.649
RICHARD:
You were a little girl.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.416
They manipulated you.

26:49.541 --> 26:52.282
You so badly wanna
believe that, don't you?

26:52.407 --> 26:54.848
That I didn't have a choice.

26:54.973 --> 26:57.049
You didn't.

26:57.174 --> 26:59.649
This takes away
the choice, Cara.

26:59.774 --> 27:01.748
The Mord-Sith
can make a person

27:01.873 --> 27:03.949
say or do anything
they want with this.

27:04.074 --> 27:06.840
It almost made me kill
the person I love most.

27:08.741 --> 27:10.949
But you didn't, did you?

27:11.074 --> 27:13.249
Because your love for her

27:13.374 --> 27:15.574
was strong enough to overcome
everything they did to you.

27:17.607 --> 27:20.583
My father's love for me wasn't.

27:20.708 --> 27:24.549
He cracked like an egg.

27:24.674 --> 27:26.082
The day I killed him,

27:26.207 --> 27:28.949
the sisters of the Agiel
welcomed me into their family.

27:29.074 --> 27:30.182
Where are your sisters now?

27:30.307 --> 27:31.482
Last I remember,
your family

27:31.607 --> 27:32.949
beat you to within
an inch of your life

27:33.074 --> 27:35.282
and left you for dead
at the bottom of a ravine.

27:35.407 --> 27:36.649
If it weren't for
the Mord-Sith

27:36.774 --> 27:39.149
making me into what I am now,
you'd be dead.

27:39.274 --> 27:41.216
Yes. Why did you
save my life?

27:41.341 --> 27:43.674
Because you're
the true Lord Rahl.

27:45.407 --> 27:47.216
But you didn't
believe that at the time.

27:47.341 --> 27:48.815
What are you trying
to get me to say?

27:48.940 --> 27:51.516
That you're sorry
for killing your father.

27:51.641 --> 27:54.349
That you never wanted
for any of this to happen.

27:54.474 --> 27:57.416
That the Mord-Sith
took your life from you.

27:57.541 --> 28:00.873
They're the ones that
are trying to take my life.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.782
You believe I'm your Lord Rahl?

28:05.907 --> 28:08.316
You're too proud
to save your own life? Fine.

28:08.441 --> 28:10.583
Then as Lord Rahl,
ruler of D'Hara,

28:10.708 --> 28:12.149
master of the Mord-Sith,

28:12.274 --> 28:13.982
I command you
to tell me everything.

28:14.107 --> 28:16.082
WOMAN:
Stop this.

28:16.207 --> 28:18.249
Who are you?

28:18.374 --> 28:20.583
I was Cara's school teacher.

28:20.708 --> 28:25.182
What the people of this town
are doing to her is horrible.

28:25.307 --> 28:28.583
I remember Cara
as a little girl.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.416
She was such a good student.

28:30.541 --> 28:35.216
So smart,
always wanting to please.

28:35.341 --> 28:37.516
Certainly, the Seeker
has proven his point.

28:37.641 --> 28:40.374
We shouldn't be punishing her,
we should be pitying her.

28:42.174 --> 28:43.882
She is a depraved murderer.

28:44.007 --> 28:45.382
We should have
killed her by now.

28:45.507 --> 28:46.748
CROWD:
Yeah.

28:46.873 --> 28:48.516
Silence.

28:48.641 --> 28:50.416
Guards,
don't let anyone leave.

28:50.541 --> 28:51.774
I wanna speak to you.

28:58.973 --> 29:00.583
<i>KAHLAN:
I don't trust
the school teacher.</i>

29:00.708 --> 29:02.949
Somebody agrees with me,
defends Cara,

29:03.074 --> 29:05.149
and now
you don't trust her?

29:05.274 --> 29:07.216
It's not because she
agrees with you, Richard,

29:07.341 --> 29:08.748
it's because
I can't read her.

29:08.873 --> 29:11.374
There's only one kind of person
that I can't read.

29:13.174 --> 29:15.182
Who is this woman to you?

29:15.307 --> 29:18.140
She told you.
She was my teacher.

29:19.607 --> 29:22.474
Remember, I've ordered you
to tell me the truth. All of it.

29:26.541 --> 29:30.015
I am telling you the truth.

29:30.140 --> 29:33.082
She taught me.

29:33.207 --> 29:35.649
Everything.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.240
I want my mother.

29:40.607 --> 29:43.015
Miss Crantan?

29:43.140 --> 29:45.949
Here, with my true family,

29:46.074 --> 29:47.940
I am called Mistress Nathair.

29:49.374 --> 29:51.649
You were always
my favorite, Cara.

29:51.774 --> 29:54.341
That's why I chose you.

29:57.307 --> 29:58.915
Grab her.
WOMAN: Kill her!

29:59.040 --> 30:01.115
We trusted her
with our children.

30:01.240 --> 30:04.240
Monster.
Guards, subdue him.

30:07.641 --> 30:11.049
How many children have you
taken from this town?

30:11.174 --> 30:13.349
Twelve girls have gone
missing over the years,

30:13.474 --> 30:15.416
and they were all
her students.

30:15.541 --> 30:18.915
Mother Confessor,
we've heard enough.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.015
We've made our decision.

30:21.140 --> 30:23.015
For what she's done,

30:23.140 --> 30:26.940
it is our will that this woman
die by confession.

30:28.407 --> 30:31.583
She has shown no remorse.

30:31.708 --> 30:35.616
It is our will that
she also die by confession.

30:35.741 --> 30:38.607
CROWD:
Yes.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.107
Will the Mother Confessor abide
by the wishes of our elders?

30:54.140 --> 30:55.383
I will.

30:55.508 --> 30:56.508
+

31:05.952 --> 31:07.528
I've never seen
such a carnival act.

31:08.131 --> 31:09.539
One shoots fire
out of his hands,

31:09.664 --> 31:12.205
the other carries
a magical torture stick,

31:12.330 --> 31:14.138
and the Confessor?

31:14.263 --> 31:17.764
Make her mad,
her eyes turn red and boom!

31:22.831 --> 31:25.039
And the Seeker. Ha!

31:25.164 --> 31:26.505
If he was so good
at seeking,

31:26.630 --> 31:28.372
you'd have think he'd
have found me by now.

31:28.497 --> 31:30.472
I think that old fool
of the First Order

31:30.597 --> 31:32.405
gave the Sword of Truth
to the wrong farm boy,

31:32.530 --> 31:35.664
that's what I think.
Do you ever stop talking?

31:37.430 --> 31:38.973
Well, since I've got this,

31:39.098 --> 31:41.164
I guess you're stuck
listening to me, aren't you?

31:43.263 --> 31:44.831
Have another drink.

31:49.731 --> 31:50.839
What the--?

31:50.964 --> 31:53.405
Oh, don't bother
trying to move.

31:53.530 --> 31:54.739
I put an elixir
in your drink.

31:54.864 --> 31:56.105
Why?

31:56.230 --> 31:58.405
Because I suddenly realized:

31:58.530 --> 31:59.772
I only need one part of you.

31:59.897 --> 32:02.639
And it's not the part
that talks.

32:02.764 --> 32:04.230
Wait. Wait.

32:06.564 --> 32:08.906
Help! Help!

32:09.031 --> 32:11.131
Help me! Help.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.939
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Shut up. Shut up.

32:15.064 --> 32:18.697
Or I'll do much worse to you
than just cut your hand off.

32:47.263 --> 32:50.597
"Fool of the First Order," eh?

32:53.397 --> 32:54.630
ZEDD:
No!

33:00.031 --> 33:01.772
C-Can't move.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.339
That lunatic put something
in my drink.

33:03.464 --> 33:06.472
Dear Spirits.
You're lucky I found you

33:06.597 --> 33:07.839
or you'd be dead by now.

33:07.964 --> 33:10.363
You can make whatever
he did go away, right?

33:11.864 --> 33:14.739
I can't use magic because
of the rune, remember?

33:14.864 --> 33:19.205
I'll just have to wait
until it wears off.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.105
Thank you.

33:21.230 --> 33:23.339
If you weren't such
a muttonhead, you'd know better

33:23.464 --> 33:25.439
than to run away from
the only people in the world

33:25.564 --> 33:27.697
who can keep you safe.

33:44.263 --> 33:47.664
I'll see you in the Underworld,
Mother Confessor.

34:06.931 --> 34:08.672
Oh, what have I done?

34:08.797 --> 34:10.839
Oh, please. Forgive me.

34:10.964 --> 34:12.973
Your remorse is meaningless.

34:13.098 --> 34:15.672
You only feel that way
because you've been confessed.

34:15.797 --> 34:18.539
NATHAIR:
Wait. Before you confess her,
there's something you must know.

34:18.664 --> 34:21.606
The Seeker was right.

34:21.731 --> 34:24.098
We forced Cara
to believe a lie.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.505
The hearing is over.
Confess her.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.706
No, you don't understand!
I must tell the truth.

34:30.831 --> 34:33.172
Confess her!

34:33.297 --> 34:35.197
Let her speak.

34:37.164 --> 34:42.464
I tortured her father
for weeks.

34:47.063 --> 34:48.672
If you want this to stop,

34:48.797 --> 34:51.105
all you have to do is tell
your daughter that you sold her.

34:51.230 --> 34:53.371
Never!

34:53.496 --> 34:54.806
But no matter what I did,

34:54.931 --> 34:59.131
his love for his little girl
was too strong.

35:03.497 --> 35:05.205
He wouldn't break.

35:05.330 --> 35:07.397
F-Finally,

35:09.497 --> 35:12.806
I decided that if he wouldn't
say what I wanted him to say,

35:12.931 --> 35:14.205
then I--

35:14.330 --> 35:18.098
I would take away
his ability to speak at all.

35:19.764 --> 35:20.939
We burned his throat.

35:21.064 --> 35:22.464
No! No--

35:28.731 --> 35:29.973
NATHAIR:
You were so young,

35:30.098 --> 35:33.263
and it was so easy to make
you believe what we wanted.

35:37.198 --> 35:38.964
Tell your daughter
what you did.

35:42.230 --> 35:44.405
Look at him, Cara,
he's so ashamed

35:44.530 --> 35:46.138
he can't even bring
himself to say it.

35:46.263 --> 35:47.739
He sold you.

35:47.864 --> 35:52.405
<i>You wanted so badly for him
to say that it was all a lie,</i>

35:52.530 --> 35:57.297
but he couldn't say it,
even if he wanted to.

36:07.031 --> 36:09.263
Confess me.

36:15.230 --> 36:17.131
I deserve it.

36:48.630 --> 36:50.931
MAN:
Confessor!

36:53.064 --> 36:55.697
I have looked
into this woman's eyes,

36:58.098 --> 37:01.230
and I see now that
she is truly remorseful.

37:03.198 --> 37:07.572
Her life was taken
from her as a child.

37:07.697 --> 37:10.405
I will not take it
from her again.

37:10.530 --> 37:12.472
You said you'd abide
by our decision!

37:12.597 --> 37:14.772
As Mother Confessor,
it is within my authority

37:14.897 --> 37:16.272
to overrule that decision.

37:16.397 --> 37:18.672
Then we'll kill her ourselves.

37:18.797 --> 37:20.098
CROWD:
Yeah!

37:54.597 --> 37:57.372
Stop!

37:57.497 --> 37:58.897
Confess her.

38:01.330 --> 38:04.272
The Mother Confessor
follows no one's orders.

38:04.397 --> 38:07.872
If you don't confess her,
I'll shoot you

38:07.997 --> 38:10.473
and then I'll shoot her.

38:10.598 --> 38:11.598
+

38:38.908 --> 38:43.074
The Mother Confessor's
word is final!

38:58.653 --> 39:00.661
Where's Cara?

39:00.786 --> 39:03.595
We decided it was best
if she didn't come.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.728
Because of Dennee?

39:05.853 --> 39:08.062
So you wouldn't have
to wake up every morning

39:08.187 --> 39:10.887
and see the face of the person
who took your sister's life.

39:13.454 --> 39:15.595
Where will she go?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.987
I don't know.

39:20.254 --> 39:21.661
She saved my life.

39:21.786 --> 39:24.062
And you spared hers.

39:24.187 --> 39:27.695
Kahlan,
what you did for her

39:27.820 --> 39:30.187
even after you found out
about Dennee...

39:31.987 --> 39:33.786
Thank you.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.621
When I saw that crossbow
aimed at my head,

39:45.786 --> 39:47.786
I thought of the warning
in my dream.

39:49.720 --> 39:54.095
If I die, the line of Confessors
could perish forever.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.420
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

39:58.053 --> 39:59.195
Ever.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.962
ZEDD:
What you know about Wizards

40:02.087 --> 40:04.095
could fit inside the teacup
of a Night Wisp.

40:04.220 --> 40:05.429
Don't get offended.

40:05.554 --> 40:07.162
All I'm saying is,
sometimes,

40:07.287 --> 40:09.462
your powers seem
a little irregular.

40:09.587 --> 40:11.254
Am I glad to see you two.

40:14.987 --> 40:16.195
What'd you do to him?

40:16.320 --> 40:18.862
Let's just say
I made him realize

40:18.987 --> 40:20.362
there are certain advantages

40:20.487 --> 40:21.987
to traveling
with a carnival act.

40:24.786 --> 40:26.828
I notice there's
one fewer of us.

40:26.953 --> 40:30.220
What happened to Cara?

40:37.053 --> 40:39.987
Some food for your travels.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.987
I've mended the dress.
You're welcome to keep it.

40:52.853 --> 40:54.987
I thinks this
suits me best.

41:04.786 --> 41:07.887
Promise me we'll
see each other again.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.920
Why are you here?

41:36.287 --> 41:38.887
I can never forgive you
for what you did to my sister,

41:41.020 --> 41:43.695
but if anything
ever happens to me,

41:43.820 --> 41:45.987
the Seeker
will need protection.

42:04.686 --> 42:06.928
Father,
do you like my new dress?

42:07.053 --> 42:10.120
Look at you.
Smart and beautiful.

42:11.953 --> 42:15.087
I can only imagine what you're
going to grow up to be someday.
