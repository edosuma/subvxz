00:00.290 --> 00:04.960
MAN:
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.460
NARRATOR:
The most powerful force

00:07.590 --> 00:09.920
ever unleashed by humankind

00:10.050 --> 00:14.470
ignites a firestorm
of UFO encounters.

00:14.590 --> 00:17.640
JASON MARTELL: We have reports
of these green fireballs

00:17.760 --> 00:19.060
being seen nightly.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.350
NARRATOR:
Mass sightings are reported

00:21.480 --> 00:23.770
at nuclear installations.

00:23.890 --> 00:27.110
Multiple military personnel
witnessed these craft

00:27.230 --> 00:29.230
interfacing with our
nuclear warheads.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.240
NARRATOR:
Bombs are taken offline.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.660
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS
If it wasn't the Russians,

00:34.780 --> 00:36.740
well, what or who is left?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.540
These were
extraterrestrial objects.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.410
PAUL HELLYER: Aliens have
always been interested

00:42.540 --> 00:45.120
in planet Earth
and its military affair.

00:45.250 --> 00:48.250
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that extraterrestrials

00:48.380 --> 00:51.760
are monitoring
our nuclear capabilities?

00:51.880 --> 00:55.590
And if so, what are their
ultimate intentions?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.510
NICK POPE:
This was the birth

00:58.640 --> 01:00.430
of the modern UFO mystery.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.349
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:05.480 --> 01:08.230
in the universe.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.360
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.900
It demands
we question everything

01:15.030 --> 01:17.240
we have ever been taught.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.120
The evidence is all around us.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.000
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.710
We are not alone.

01:27.830 --> 01:30.960
We have never been alone.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.310
NARRATOR:
The Pentagon.

01:41.430 --> 01:45.680
April 23, 2019.

01:45.810 --> 01:49.900
The United States Navy
announces that it is creating

01:50.020 --> 01:52.770
new formal guidelines
to encourage pilots

01:52.900 --> 01:55.740
and other servicemen
to report UFO sightings.

01:55.860 --> 01:58.820
Officials promise that

01:58.950 --> 02:00.950
all such accounts
will be taken seriously

02:01.070 --> 02:02.740
and fully investigated.

02:02.870 --> 02:05.910
The move marks a significant
change in protocol

02:06.040 --> 02:07.750
by the U.S. military,

02:07.870 --> 02:09.960
which previously
has tried to deny

02:10.080 --> 02:12.290
or cover up these sightings.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.130
WILLIAM HENRY: The Navy is
saying we're willing to listen,

02:14.250 --> 02:16.090
we're gonna collect this data,

02:16.210 --> 02:20.140
we've seen too many examples
of unidentified aerial phenomena

02:20.260 --> 02:23.600
around strike groups and other
very important installations,

02:23.720 --> 02:26.310
it's time that we start getting
some more eyes on this.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.230
NARRATOR:
Officials are quick

02:28.350 --> 02:30.940
to dismiss the suggestion
that these craft

02:31.060 --> 02:35.070
have any connection
to extraterrestrials,

02:35.190 --> 02:38.570
but there is a long history
of military personnel

02:38.700 --> 02:42.530
reporting encounters with craft
that defy explanation,

02:42.660 --> 02:45.700
both around military bases
and, particularly,

02:45.830 --> 02:48.290
nuclear weapons.

02:48.410 --> 02:52.790
POPE: Something about
these nuclear facilities

02:52.920 --> 02:55.920
seems to be attracting
these UFOs.

02:56.050 --> 02:59.510
Something that we are doing
there is of interest,

02:59.630 --> 03:01.130
and of course,
the logical deduction is

03:01.260 --> 03:02.680
that it's the presence

03:02.800 --> 03:05.600
of the nuclear weapons
themselves.

03:08.310 --> 03:10.480
NARRATOR:
Alamogordo, New Mexico.

03:10.600 --> 03:15.270
July 16, 1945.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.900
At a remote site in the Jornada
Del Muerto Desert of New Mexico,

03:20.030 --> 03:23.950
the Army successfully detonates
the world's first atomic bomb.

03:27.410 --> 03:31.000
The top secret test is given
the code name "Trinity."

03:31.120 --> 03:33.830
It is an ominous preview

03:33.960 --> 03:37.300
of the destructive potential
of nuclear weapons.

03:37.420 --> 03:40.090
MARTIN K.A. MORGAN: The Trinity
test was a turning point in history.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.840
It rates up there
along with harnessing fire.

03:43.970 --> 03:47.970
It's truly, and in every sense,
a milestone in human history.

03:50.310 --> 03:53.440
NARRATOR: Just a few weeks after the
test, the United States

03:53.560 --> 03:56.190
dropped atomic bombs
on the Japanese cities

03:56.310 --> 03:58.650
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

04:05.030 --> 04:07.450
The result was 200,000

04:07.580 --> 04:10.870
men, women, and children dead.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.870
Thousands more were poisoned

04:13.000 --> 04:15.920
or disfigured by radiation.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.089
In a world war that had claimed

04:19.209 --> 04:21.839
an estimated 85 million lives,

04:21.970 --> 04:24.680
and threatened
to claim millions more,

04:24.800 --> 04:28.600
the bombs succeeded in shocking
Japan into surrender.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.480
But back in New Mexico,

04:31.600 --> 04:35.060
the Trinity blast also unleashed
something unexpected,

04:35.190 --> 04:38.570
a series of bizarre
UFO sightings

04:38.690 --> 04:42.650
described by witnesses
as green fireballs.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.700
So right after
the Trinity test site,

04:45.820 --> 04:48.700
we have various reports
of these green fireballs

04:48.830 --> 04:50.200
being seen nightly

04:50.330 --> 04:52.540
flying around
at incredible speeds,

04:52.660 --> 04:55.040
and no one could identify
what these objects were.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.540
HELLYER: The best explanation
is that they are, in fact,

04:58.670 --> 05:02.380
drone reconnaissance vehicles
from a scout, uh, ship.

05:02.510 --> 05:06.130
They send out these drones
and collect the information.

05:06.260 --> 05:10.140
NARRATOR: Despite being
investigated by Air Force officers

05:10.260 --> 05:12.180
and world-renowned physicists,

05:12.310 --> 05:14.730
no scientific explanation
for the fireballs

05:14.850 --> 05:16.520
was ever found.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.360
But this was by no means
the beginning.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.570
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

05:23.690 --> 05:25.990
evidence that people had been
witnessing alien craft

05:26.110 --> 05:29.070
in the sky had been documented
for centuries.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.450
And in the weeks and years
that followed

05:34.580 --> 05:36.290
the detonation
of the atomic bomb,

05:36.410 --> 05:39.210
the number of UFO sightings

05:39.330 --> 05:41.840
began to escalate dramatically.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.260
POPE:
After Hiroshima,

05:44.380 --> 05:48.930
there was a quantum leap change
in all of this

05:49.050 --> 05:53.600
and a sudden, rapid acceleration
of the pace of events.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.640
The modern UFO phenomenon
really took hold

05:57.770 --> 05:59.350
in a very short order,

05:59.480 --> 06:01.190
and the pace of all this

06:01.310 --> 06:05.150
just increased exponentially.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.820
NARRATOR: Less than two years
after the end of World War II

06:09.950 --> 06:13.490
came one of the most famous UFO
sightings in American history,

06:13.620 --> 06:15.660
and it happened just miles

06:15.790 --> 06:18.790
from America's most important
nuclear facility.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.670
On June 24, 1947,

06:23.800 --> 06:25.380
near Mount Rainier
in Washington,

06:25.510 --> 06:28.550
a private pilot
named Kenneth Arnold

06:28.680 --> 06:31.680
witnessed nine shining,
disc-shaped aircraft

06:31.800 --> 06:34.890
move at an impossible speed
across the horizon

06:35.020 --> 06:36.520
before disappearing from view.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.810
POPE:
These nine objects

06:39.940 --> 06:43.480
flew in formation at speeds

06:43.610 --> 06:45.280
that he estimated at

06:45.400 --> 06:47.900
what at the time
was a staggering

06:48.030 --> 06:51.660
1,200 miles per hour,

06:51.780 --> 06:54.780
but what a lot of people
don't realize about that

06:54.910 --> 06:57.910
is how close this sighting was

06:58.040 --> 07:01.920
to the Hanford nuclear
processing facility.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.500
MORGAN: The Hanford nuclear
site is where the United States

07:05.630 --> 07:09.510
established its first plutonium
production facility,

07:09.630 --> 07:12.140
and this facility was producing
the fissile material

07:12.260 --> 07:14.010
that would later be used
in atomic bombs.

07:14.140 --> 07:17.100
The atomic bomb
in the Second World War

07:17.220 --> 07:20.520
could not have been developed
without Hanford.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.440
NARRATOR: Then,
just weeks after Arnold's sighting,

07:24.560 --> 07:26.650
came the famous
Roswell incident.

07:30.820 --> 07:33.990
After a mysterious craft crashed
in the New Mexico desert

07:34.120 --> 07:35.620
outside Roswell,

07:35.740 --> 07:37.540
military officials announced

07:37.660 --> 07:40.500
they had retrieved
a flying saucer.

07:40.620 --> 07:43.670
The next day, they suddenly
changed the story

07:43.790 --> 07:47.090
and claimed it was just
a weather balloon.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.920
Ever since, the Roswell incident

07:50.050 --> 07:53.840
has been the subject of endless
speculation and debate,

07:53.970 --> 07:56.680
but no one debates
that it happened literally

07:56.810 --> 07:59.640
on the doorstep of
Roswell Air Force Base,

07:59.770 --> 08:03.400
home to the 509th Bomb Wing,

08:03.520 --> 08:05.360
the unit that dropped
the atomic bombs

08:05.480 --> 08:08.820
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.860
The 509th Bomb Wing

08:10.990 --> 08:13.610
was the most knowledgeable
group of humans

08:13.740 --> 08:16.660
on the planet at that time
that knew about nuclear bombs

08:16.780 --> 08:18.240
and nuclear warfare.

08:18.370 --> 08:22.370
NARRATOR:
In June of 1948,

08:22.500 --> 08:25.420
exactly one year after
the Roswell incident,

08:25.540 --> 08:30.050
a similar UFO event occurred
in the Soviet Union.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.510
At the time, the Soviets
were on the brink of developing

08:33.630 --> 08:35.640
their own atomic weapon,

08:35.760 --> 08:38.720
and the UFO encounter
occurred at their primary

08:38.850 --> 08:43.600
ballistic missile test site,
Kapustin Yar.

08:43.730 --> 08:46.940
PAUL STONEHILL;
It's a highly classified case,

08:47.060 --> 08:49.730
but allegedly,
a silver, cigar-shaped

08:49.860 --> 08:52.530
object appeared
over the testing grounds.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.200
And the Soviets were able to
actually shoot this object down.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.830
They found remnants
of bodies in it

09:03.960 --> 09:05.670
and also technology,

09:05.790 --> 09:08.840
which was recovered and taken to

09:08.960 --> 09:12.880
the local bunker where they
kept it, allegedly, for years.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.680
NARRATOR:
Kenneth Arnold's sighting.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.090
The Roswell crash.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.180
The Kapustin Yar incident.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.930
Many believe it was

09:23.060 --> 09:26.310
these events that ignited
the modern UFO era.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.060
But is it a coincidence
that they all happened

09:29.190 --> 09:30.520
next to important

09:30.650 --> 09:33.690
nuclear weapon and
ballistic missile facilities?

09:33.820 --> 09:36.990
While little has been documented
about UFO encounters

09:37.110 --> 09:39.370
in the Soviet Union
during this time,

09:39.490 --> 09:42.580
similar sightings were soon
reported in the vicinity

09:42.700 --> 09:45.370
of virtually every other
nuclear installation

09:45.500 --> 09:47.710
in the United States.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.380
HENRY: The sites where we're
developing these weapons...

09:50.500 --> 09:52.590
Sandia, Savannah River,

09:52.710 --> 09:54.510
Los Alamos, Oak Ridge...

09:54.630 --> 09:57.340
There were UFO sightings
at these labs as well.

09:57.470 --> 09:59.760
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
To me, the word that

09:59.890 --> 10:01.760
we all should
be concentrating on

10:01.890 --> 10:05.730
around the world is:
Governments, powerbrokers

10:05.850 --> 10:07.850
confirm for us

10:07.980 --> 10:10.860
everything that has been
being reported

10:10.980 --> 10:12.860
since World War II.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.150
We are dealing
with other intelligences.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.110
They are here,
they are around us,

10:19.240 --> 10:23.370
and they are right
under our noses.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.290
NARRATOR:
The post-World War II sightings

10:26.410 --> 10:29.170
shocked the military
establishment,

10:29.290 --> 10:31.630
but America's monopoly
on nuclear weapons

10:31.750 --> 10:34.550
was about to come
to an explosive end.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.430
And as a nuclear
arms race erupted

10:39.550 --> 10:41.720
with the USSR,

10:41.850 --> 10:45.810
the rash of UFO sightings
would expand beyond America

10:45.930 --> 10:48.310
and engulf the planet.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.860
NARRATOR:
Kazakh Republic,

10:57.990 --> 10:59.530
Soviet Union,

10:59.650 --> 11:03.700
August 29, 1949.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.620
At a secret testing
site four years

11:06.740 --> 11:09.250
after the end of World War II,

11:09.370 --> 11:12.540
the Soviets become only
the second country in the world

11:12.670 --> 11:15.670
to successfully detonate
an atomic bomb.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.380
Code-named "First Lightning,"
the bomb signals to the West

11:21.510 --> 11:23.720
that the Soviets
are capable of matching

11:23.850 --> 11:26.810
the nuclear might
of the United States.

11:29.140 --> 11:31.770
After the first
Soviet nuclear test,

11:31.900 --> 11:34.690
the United States
begins to react...

11:36.110 --> 11:38.230
and begins reacting

11:38.360 --> 11:41.450
by developing newer
and more powerful weapons,

11:41.570 --> 11:45.910
developing more effective
delivery systems.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.620
In other words,
once the Soviets set off

11:47.740 --> 11:52.080
their first nuclear test,
a nuclear arms race begins.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.130
NARRATOR: Desperate to
stay ahead of the Soviets,

11:56.250 --> 12:00.670
the U.S. races to develop
a vastly more powerful device,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.050
a hydrogen bomb.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.600
This devastating new weapon
is first tested underwater

12:06.720 --> 12:11.140
near the Marshall Islands
in 1952.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.860
The colossal yield
is terrifying:

12:16.980 --> 12:20.150
Over 700 times the power
of the Hiroshima bomb.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.410
But the size of the new weapons
hardly deters UFO sightings,

12:26.530 --> 12:29.040
which occur before, during

12:29.160 --> 12:32.120
and after these explosions,

12:32.250 --> 12:34.620
although the public
is never informed.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.670
POPE:
Time and time again,

12:37.790 --> 12:41.760
when bomb tests are conducted,
there are UFOs.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.510
Something that we are doing,

12:45.640 --> 12:49.930
seemingly, is grabbing
the attention of the UFOs,

12:50.060 --> 12:53.140
or the intelligence
behind the UFOs.

12:53.270 --> 12:56.690
NARRATOR: The U.S.
Air Force is so concerned

12:56.810 --> 12:58.650
that in 1952,

12:58.770 --> 13:00.900
<i>Look</i> magazine
runs a story entitled

13:01.030 --> 13:03.740
"Hunt for the Flying Saucer,"

13:03.860 --> 13:05.990
detailing a secret
Air Force investigation

13:06.110 --> 13:10.080
into a rash
of over 800 UFO sightings.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.950
The article points out

13:12.080 --> 13:15.080
that an Air Force map
of the UFO sightings

13:15.210 --> 13:19.710
duplicates "exactly the area
of atomic energy installations."

13:19.840 --> 13:22.840
It also reports that
the government is distributing

13:22.960 --> 13:26.510
200 special cameras
to atomic plant guards,

13:26.630 --> 13:30.220
hoping to photograph
the mysterious intruders.

13:30.350 --> 13:34.980
We have eyewitness testimony
from all sorts

13:35.100 --> 13:36.440
of different branches
of military...

13:38.520 --> 13:40.690
from people who are sworn
under oath,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.530
and there are trained observers
that witnessed

13:43.650 --> 13:47.200
these massive disc-shaped
objects come in,

13:47.320 --> 13:49.820
hover over top
of these nuclear facilities.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.280
And this, of course,
would have been a breach

13:51.410 --> 13:53.370
of national security.
This would have gone

13:53.490 --> 13:55.870
all the way up the food chain
to the very, very top,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.620
about how these craft
are actually interfacing

13:57.750 --> 13:59.540
with our nuclear warheads.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.710
NARRATOR: Does the sheer
volume of sightings

14:02.840 --> 14:06.050
suggest that as the threat
of nuclear war grew,

14:06.170 --> 14:08.630
extraterrestrials became
increasingly concerned

14:08.760 --> 14:11.890
about the fate of the Earth?

14:12.010 --> 14:15.680
Could they have been looking
for ways to save mankind,

14:15.810 --> 14:20.400
perhaps by disabling
its nuclear weapons?

14:20.520 --> 14:23.570
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

14:23.690 --> 14:26.610
that such an audacious notion
is possible,

14:26.740 --> 14:29.820
and point to evidence
that as the arms race escalated,

14:29.950 --> 14:33.700
these aliens became
more than just observers.

14:36.410 --> 14:39.620
Vandenberg Air Force Base.

14:39.750 --> 14:44.210
September, 1964.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.880
The Air Force prepares

14:48.010 --> 14:49.800
to conduct a series
of test launches

14:49.930 --> 14:53.850
of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, known as ICBMs,

14:53.970 --> 14:58.100
from this base along
the central coast of California.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.770
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:59.890 --> 15:01.940
These powerful missiles
reduce the time it takes

15:02.060 --> 15:03.560
to strike the Soviet Union

15:03.690 --> 15:06.190
from 12 hours in a B-52 bomber

15:06.320 --> 15:09.860
to a mere 30 minutes.

15:09.990 --> 15:14.120
MORGAN: Suddenly, all it takes is
a go order and the weapons launch.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.910
Within a split second,
a thermonuclear attack

15:18.040 --> 15:20.830
goes downrange
toward the opposition.

15:23.460 --> 15:26.840
NARRATOR: In order to film
the Vandenberg missile tests,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.510
Air Force cameraman
Lieutenant Robert Jacobs

15:29.630 --> 15:32.550
set up an ultra light-sensitive
telescopic camera

15:32.680 --> 15:35.810
124 miles northwest of the base,

15:35.930 --> 15:38.180
in the forest above Big Sur.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.690
MAN:
Liftoff.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.860
NARRATOR:
After filming the launch,

15:44.980 --> 15:47.070
Lieutenant Jacobs
brought the raw footage

15:47.190 --> 15:50.740
back to Vandenberg for analysis.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.740
The next day, Jacobs'
commanding officer,

15:53.870 --> 15:57.870
Major Florenz Mansmann, showed
him the newly developed film.

15:57.990 --> 16:02.710
To Jacobs's shock,
a UFO zoomed into in the frame

16:02.830 --> 16:07.420
and traveled alongside the ICBM
at over 11,000 miles per hour.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.340
STEVE BASSETT:
The rocket launches perfectly,

16:09.460 --> 16:11.380
first stage falls off,
second stage falls off,

16:11.510 --> 16:14.890
third stage falls off and now
you've got the dummy warhead.

16:15.010 --> 16:16.760
Suddenly, a craft,
very disc-like,

16:16.890 --> 16:19.020
moves in into the screen,

16:19.140 --> 16:21.560
and starts maneuvering
around it.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.810
And then, it seems to fire
a beam at this dummy warhead.

16:25.940 --> 16:29.280
It burned up in the atmosphere.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.030
The test failed.

16:32.150 --> 16:35.910
The rocket was destroyed
or knocked off course.

16:36.030 --> 16:40.620
Now, if true, this would be
direct intervention

16:40.750 --> 16:42.790
on the part of a UFO,

16:42.910 --> 16:46.920
to disrupt, perhaps destroy,

16:47.040 --> 16:48.380
one of our weapons tests.

16:50.090 --> 16:52.970
They invited the CIA
to come in and see it.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.680
The CIA said, "Very interesting,

16:55.800 --> 16:58.930
we're gonna take that film and
you're... this never happened."

16:59.060 --> 17:02.640
Jacobs had records,
he had actual records

17:02.770 --> 17:05.230
of what he did that day,

17:05.349 --> 17:08.650
and Major Mansmann
denied his story at first.

17:08.770 --> 17:12.530
He later on supported it,
so it's a supported story.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.950
NARRATOR:
To this day,

17:15.069 --> 17:18.280
the government denies that
any such film footage exists.

17:18.410 --> 17:20.619
But if so, why would

17:20.740 --> 17:22.660
two highly-trained
military professionals

17:22.790 --> 17:24.869
make up such a story?

17:25.000 --> 17:29.170
BASSET: It's notable that after
this, Dr. Jacobs started getting

17:29.290 --> 17:31.460
lots of harassing phone calls

17:31.590 --> 17:35.220
and other harassments,
including his mailbox blown up.

17:35.340 --> 17:38.050
So somebody was not happy.

17:38.180 --> 17:40.390
I believe that film
still exists,

17:40.510 --> 17:42.770
and I think one day
we will see it.

17:42.890 --> 17:46.640
NARRATOR: After Vandenburg,
the rash of interference

17:46.770 --> 17:49.610
with nuclear missile facilities
only increased.

17:49.730 --> 17:54.440
Four years later,
at Minot Air Force Base in 1968,

17:54.570 --> 17:57.660
a UFO reportedly removed
the massive cover

17:57.780 --> 18:00.530
from a missile silo.

18:00.660 --> 18:05.330
SALAS: This object had
literally removed the cover

18:05.450 --> 18:07.790
from the launch facility.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.460
It was a 20-ton
concrete, steel cover

18:11.590 --> 18:14.380
that could only be removed
through explosive bolts

18:14.510 --> 18:17.840
or taken off on rails.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.600
NARRATOR: What do incidents
like those at Vandenberg, Minot

18:23.720 --> 18:26.270
and other
nuclear facilities mean?

18:26.390 --> 18:29.480
Are they a warning or a threat?

18:29.600 --> 18:32.060
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

18:32.190 --> 18:34.030
that a vital clue was provided

18:34.150 --> 18:37.990
during one of the most shocking
incidents in UFO history,

18:38.110 --> 18:40.200
- (alarm blaring)
- when extraterrestrials

18:40.320 --> 18:42.990
didn't simply monitor
nuclear facilities,

18:43.120 --> 18:46.080
but started
taking control of them.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.800
NARRATOR:
Washington, D.C..

18:57.170 --> 19:00.720
September 27, 2010.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.550
Determined to inform the public
about UFO sightings

19:03.680 --> 19:06.180
at nuclear sites,

19:06.310 --> 19:08.310
former Air Force Commander
Robert Salas

19:08.430 --> 19:11.230
and UFO researcher
Robert Hastings

19:11.350 --> 19:14.520
organize a public hearing
at the National Press Club.

19:14.650 --> 19:17.570
Isn't it time
for the truth to be revealed?

19:17.690 --> 19:18.650
NARRATOR: They introduce
the national media

19:18.780 --> 19:21.280
to former Air Force officers

19:21.410 --> 19:24.580
who give chilling accounts
of UFO encounters

19:24.700 --> 19:26.240
at nuclear weapons sites.

19:26.370 --> 19:29.250
Encounters they witnessed
themselves.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.370
He was as white as sheet.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.960
He said, "Its back."
I said, "What's back?"

19:34.090 --> 19:35.460
He said, "The UFO."

19:35.590 --> 19:37.550
Probably about 1:00, 1:30,

19:37.670 --> 19:42.260
uh, and a...
unidentified flying object

19:42.390 --> 19:44.970
came from the north
and stopped right over us.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.720
A UFO was sited over Echo Flight
about the same time

19:48.850 --> 19:50.940
all missiles in Echo Flight
went down.

19:51.060 --> 19:53.900
I am convinced
that somebody out there

19:54.020 --> 19:56.650
is trying to send us a message.

19:56.770 --> 20:00.190
NARRATOR: The stories attempt
to reverse a decades-old pattern

20:00.320 --> 20:03.450
of military cover-ups
and denial.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.620
POPE: A number of former
military witnesses

20:08.740 --> 20:10.120
went on the record

20:10.250 --> 20:14.830
that UFOs had been
seen directly over

20:14.960 --> 20:19.130
or in very close proximity
to these nuclear facilities

20:19.260 --> 20:21.760
and that these UFOs,
whatever they were,

20:21.880 --> 20:25.180
were clearly
under intelligent control.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.310
NARRATOR: Press conference
co-organizer Robert Salas

20:28.430 --> 20:30.140
had a very personal stake

20:30.270 --> 20:32.560
in challenging
the official cover-up.

20:32.690 --> 20:36.310
That is clearly misleading.
It is false.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.650
NARRATOR:
In 1967, Salas was stationed

20:40.780 --> 20:44.110
at the Malmstrom nuclear missile
facility in Montana

20:44.240 --> 20:47.030
when UFOs not only
appeared overhead,

20:47.160 --> 20:51.160
they shut down the ten nuclear
missiles under his control.

20:51.290 --> 20:55.370
Malmstrom remains one of
the most infamous and baffling

20:55.500 --> 20:58.920
UFO encounters
in American history.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.050
POPE To lose so many
nuclear missiles...

21:02.170 --> 21:06.090
To have them inoperative... this
was an unprecedented incident.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.470
Yes, there had been
UFO sightings

21:08.600 --> 21:12.180
at nuclear facilities before,
but nothing like this.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.690
NARRATOR:
Wall, South Dakota.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.480
June 28, 2019.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.490
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

21:25.610 --> 21:28.910
has asked Robert Salas
to join him

21:29.030 --> 21:32.500
at The Minuteman Missile
National Historic Site.

21:32.620 --> 21:36.960
So, how does it feel to be back
after so many years?

21:37.080 --> 21:40.670
Uh, this will be kind of
a strange déjà vu.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.170
NARRATOR:
Giorgio wants to learn firsthand

21:43.300 --> 21:47.640
what happened to Salas
at Malmstrom in 1967.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.100
While many Minuteman missile
sites were deactivated

21:52.220 --> 21:53.970
at the end of the Cold War,

21:54.100 --> 21:57.100
this facility has been
carefully preserved

21:57.230 --> 21:59.560
in its original form.

21:59.690 --> 22:02.400
It remains almost identical
to the Malmstrom site,

22:02.530 --> 22:05.490
where Salas witnessed
the UFO incursion.

22:05.610 --> 22:08.570
TSOUKALOS:
A similar facility where

22:08.700 --> 22:11.080
your story happened
that fateful night.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.280
It's very similar.

22:12.410 --> 22:13.990
A lot of the sites
looked exactly the same.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.040
Where were you on that night?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.080
Yeah, on that night
I was 60 feet underground

22:19.210 --> 22:22.420
in a reinforced
concrete capsule.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.340
And, now, where are
the actual silos?

22:25.460 --> 22:28.930
The silos are about
a mile or so away

22:29.050 --> 22:30.970
from this central position.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.970
- Can we check that out as well?
- Let's do it.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.430
That would be amazing.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.770
NARRATOR: Giorgio and Robert

22:37.890 --> 22:39.940
make their way
to an adjoining silo,

22:40.060 --> 22:43.480
where a deactivated
Minuteman missile is preserved.

22:43.610 --> 22:47.400
They harness up and descend
30 feet to get a better look

22:47.530 --> 22:49.570
at a weapon that once
held the power

22:49.700 --> 22:53.280
to obliterate millions
in a split-second.

22:53.410 --> 22:54.700
TSOUKALOS:
Welcome to the <i>Enterprise.</i>

22:57.870 --> 22:58.960
(chuckles)

22:59.080 --> 23:01.080
So this is one of these

23:01.210 --> 23:04.250
- Minutemen missiles.
- Exactly.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.750
Minuteman One.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.550
The first missile went
into the hole in '62,

23:08.670 --> 23:11.300
just at the time of the Cuban
Missile Crisis, just before.

23:11.430 --> 23:14.390
These have a range
of about 6,000 miles.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.600
Now, the warhead we had
was 1.2 megatons.

23:21.310 --> 23:25.520
Just to put it in perspective,
the bomb that hit Hiroshima

23:25.650 --> 23:27.570
was 15 kilotons.

23:27.690 --> 23:32.280
So 15,000 tons versus
1.2 million tons

23:32.410 --> 23:34.330
of TNT equivalent.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.540
We had 150 of these

23:37.660 --> 23:39.500
just at Malmstrom alone.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.250
TSOUKALOS:
We should all be so lucky that

23:41.370 --> 23:42.580
these things were never fired.

23:42.710 --> 23:44.880
- Absolutely.
- 'Cause that would have been

23:45.000 --> 23:47.340
- complete devastation.
- Absolutely.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.090
TSOUKALOS:
When your incident happened,

23:51.220 --> 23:54.050
do you remember whether
there was any damage

23:54.180 --> 23:56.180
to the missile itself, or...

23:56.310 --> 23:57.970
Let me tell you what happened.
And there was no damage.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.140
What happened was

24:00.270 --> 24:02.770
signals were sent
to each of the ten missiles,

24:02.900 --> 24:05.270
allegedly from the UFO,

24:05.400 --> 24:07.780
penetrating 60 feet
of earth and concrete.

24:07.900 --> 24:11.820
It upset this guidance
and control system.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.030
Uh, that's what
shut the missiles down.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.080
TSOUKALOS: I venture to say
that it was not a short circuit.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.700
SALAS:
They could not isolate it

24:19.830 --> 24:22.960
to any short circuit.
And believe me,

24:23.080 --> 24:26.130
they did extensive investigation
on this thing.

24:26.250 --> 24:29.210
TSOUKALOS: Well, this was incredible,
but I also would like to see

24:29.340 --> 24:31.420
- your command center, so can we go check that out?
- You bet.

24:31.550 --> 24:33.800
- All right. Let's do it.
- Let's go to the launch control center.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.270
Let's go in here.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.480
Thank you very much.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.230
Then we go down the elevator.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.990
And there's the blast door,
Giorgio.

24:59.120 --> 24:59.990
Wow.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.040
Look at this thing.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.750
This is huge.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.790
It was, of course, designed
to withstand nuclear blasts.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.210
So let's go on in.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.510
Wow.

25:14.630 --> 25:15.970
This is the capsule.

25:16.090 --> 25:18.970
We were down here for 24 hours.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.850
You know, it even
smells the same.

25:20.970 --> 25:22.310
(laughs)
I remember.

25:22.430 --> 25:23.310
I remember the smells.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.770
Yeah.

25:27.770 --> 25:30.020
Tell me what happened
that night.

25:30.150 --> 25:32.030
I was in charge.
My commander was out.

25:32.150 --> 25:33.570
He was taking a nap.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.150
First thing that happened is
I got a phone call

25:35.280 --> 25:36.610
from the topside guard.

25:36.740 --> 25:39.530
"Uh, sir, the guards and I
are out here,

25:39.660 --> 25:42.040
"we're looking up at the sky
and we see these strange lights

25:42.160 --> 25:44.410
"flying around above us.

25:44.540 --> 25:48.080
"They're flying very fast,
stopping on a dime,

25:48.210 --> 25:49.960
"reversing course.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.960
No engine noise."

25:52.090 --> 25:54.170
I said, "Okay.

25:54.300 --> 25:55.590
Let me know if something
more interesting happens,"

25:55.720 --> 25:57.760
basically, and I went back
to my book.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.850
So about five minutes later,
he calls back,

26:00.970 --> 26:02.560
and this time he's
screaming into the phone.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.100
I mean, he's really frightened.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.310
(alarm blaring)

26:07.440 --> 26:11.150
He said, "I got all the guards
out here, weapons drawn,

26:11.270 --> 26:15.070
"and we see this gigantic
red-orange object, oval shaped,

26:15.190 --> 26:20.160
hovering above the front gate."

26:20.280 --> 26:23.950
Uh, I was sure we were under
some sort of an attack,

26:24.080 --> 26:26.960
and I said, "Use whatever
force necessary,

26:27.080 --> 26:29.750
but make sure nothing comes in
the fenced area."

26:29.880 --> 26:32.040
So the next thing I did is
I come over here,

26:32.170 --> 26:34.130
wake up my commander,

26:34.250 --> 26:38.050
and start telling him
about the phone calls.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.140
And all of a sudden

26:40.260 --> 26:43.640
- we get Klaxons, horns.
- (Klaxons blaring)

26:43.760 --> 26:47.350
We both look over
at the control panel here,

26:47.480 --> 26:49.520
and boom, boom, boom,
one right after the other.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.150
(clacking)

26:51.270 --> 26:52.690
All no-go.

26:56.030 --> 26:58.450
An-And each of these missiles
is on an independent system.

26:58.570 --> 27:00.110
Exactly.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.990
They're not like
Christmas tree lights,

27:02.120 --> 27:03.950
where if one goes out,
the rest of them go out.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.330
No, it's not like that.

27:05.450 --> 27:08.210
Meanwhile, my commander
was calling command post.

27:08.330 --> 27:09.710
So when he was finished
with that call,

27:09.830 --> 27:12.840
he turns to me and says
the same thing happened

27:12.960 --> 27:15.210
at another launch facility
a week earlier.

27:15.340 --> 27:17.630
I mean, it has to be
incredibly startling

27:17.760 --> 27:20.220
and disconcerting
that someone else

27:20.340 --> 27:23.890
with higher technology
is able to disable our missiles.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.220
- Right.
- If it wasn't us, the U.S.,

27:26.350 --> 27:28.930
and it wasn't the Russians
or the Chinese or whoever,

27:29.060 --> 27:31.690
well, what or who is left?

27:31.810 --> 27:34.650
Exactly. And that's how I've
come to the conclusion

27:34.770 --> 27:37.530
that these were
extraterrestrial objects.

27:37.650 --> 27:41.410
- Or they were constructed off Earth.
- Mm-hmm.

27:41.530 --> 27:45.120
Because we had nothing that
could do anything like this,

27:45.240 --> 27:47.540
either then or now.

27:50.250 --> 27:53.500
NARRATOR: Military officials have
never provided an explanation

27:53.630 --> 27:55.460
for the missile shutdown.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.510
Was it caused by
extraterrestrials?

27:58.630 --> 28:01.630
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

28:01.760 --> 28:04.010
and suggest that proof lies

28:04.140 --> 28:07.350
in the fact that for 50 years,

28:07.470 --> 28:10.230
the United States military
covered it up.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.150
NARRATOR: The Minuteman Missile
National Historic Site.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.610
South Dakota.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.610
June 28, 2019.

28:22.740 --> 28:23.990
Wow.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.240
NARRATOR:
Giorgio Tsoukalos is with

28:28.370 --> 28:30.290
former Air Force commander
Robert Salas

28:30.410 --> 28:32.500
at a decommissioned
nuclear launch site

28:32.620 --> 28:36.250
that is identical to one
at Malmstrom Air Force Base,

28:36.380 --> 28:40.170
where Salas had
a UFO encounter in 1967.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.680
So after the object flew away,

28:43.800 --> 28:45.510
what happened next?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.430
The missiles come back online?

28:47.550 --> 28:48.890
We had to bring
maintenance crews out

28:49.010 --> 28:52.180
to go through a very
intricate procedure

28:52.310 --> 28:54.730
to bring them back up online.

28:54.850 --> 28:58.230
Within 24 hours,
we had our missiles back up.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.820
TSOUKALOS:
And then was there a debriefing

29:00.940 --> 29:02.860
or was there a discussion?

29:02.990 --> 29:05.860
We were ordered to our
squadron commander's office.

29:05.990 --> 29:10.450
Right away, I say, "What the
hell happened out there?"

29:10.580 --> 29:14.040
And he said, "I don't know."

29:14.160 --> 29:17.170
I asked him specifically,

29:17.290 --> 29:20.710
"Could it have been some kind
of an Air Force exercise?"

29:20.840 --> 29:24.420
And he said, "Absolutely not."

29:24.550 --> 29:26.510
And then the guy next to him,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.720
he shoved this paper
in our faces. "Sign here."

29:31.220 --> 29:32.810
I said, "What is this?"

29:32.930 --> 29:35.520
He said, "This is a
nondisclosure statement

29:35.640 --> 29:37.900
"about the incident.

29:38.020 --> 29:40.730
You are never to speak
about it to anybody."

29:40.860 --> 29:42.070
So you were given an order.

29:42.190 --> 29:43.860
We were ordered to sign, yeah.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.280
And that was it.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.200
Uh, I could not speak
about this,

29:48.320 --> 29:51.450
and I didn't speak about this
to anyone for, uh,

29:51.580 --> 29:53.700
about 27 years.

29:53.830 --> 29:56.420
NARRATOR: Some believe
that the ability of UFOs

29:56.540 --> 29:58.130
to shut down nuclear missiles

29:58.250 --> 30:01.670
poses a grave threat
to national security,

30:01.800 --> 30:04.090
and that the Malmstrom
incident suggests

30:04.210 --> 30:06.680
the aliens had a hostile intent.

30:06.800 --> 30:10.550
But Robert Salas believes
it shows the opposite.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.310
The intruders were demonstrating
their concern for mankind.

30:15.430 --> 30:18.400
They did not damage
the missiles.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.650
They did not hurt anybody.

30:20.770 --> 30:22.730
If they had some kind
of a weapon,

30:22.860 --> 30:24.940
They did not use it
against any...

30:25.070 --> 30:27.030
any of the... of the guards.

30:27.150 --> 30:29.950
So all it was, to me,
was a message,

30:30.070 --> 30:32.780
and the message was,
"Get rid of your nukes.

30:32.910 --> 30:35.500
"They will not help you

30:35.620 --> 30:38.500
- in any way advance your civilization."
- Right.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.330
Over the years,
you've thought about this

30:40.460 --> 30:42.670
and, essentially,
it was a warning

30:42.790 --> 30:44.420
that this is not the way to go.

30:44.550 --> 30:47.090
Exactly. Exactly.

30:47.220 --> 30:51.680
Robert Salas and his commander
saw that all ten missiles,

30:51.800 --> 30:54.600
one by one, went offline.

30:54.720 --> 30:58.810
Now, this is something that
the Air Force later deemed

30:58.940 --> 31:01.770
could not be possible,
because all of these missiles

31:01.900 --> 31:03.400
are all independent.

31:03.520 --> 31:07.190
So the likelihood
of someone being able to

31:07.320 --> 31:10.530
manipulate this is almost zero.

31:10.660 --> 31:14.990
And I say almost zero because,
clearly, somebody did it.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.580
I could feel the emotion
by Robert.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.710
And for over 20 years
he has investigated this,

31:21.830 --> 31:24.630
and there are dozens
of similar examples.

31:27.170 --> 31:30.340
NARRATOR: Were incidents like
Malmstrom attempts to force mankind

31:30.470 --> 31:32.390
to abolish nuclear weapons?

31:34.550 --> 31:37.060
If so, they did not succeed.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.680
The arms race continued unabated

31:39.810 --> 31:42.560
through the 1970s and '80s.

31:42.690 --> 31:46.530
And so did reports
of UFOs at nuclear sites.

31:46.650 --> 31:50.900
During the famous Rendlesham
Forest incident in 1980,

31:51.030 --> 31:53.370
dozens of military witnesses
reported

31:53.490 --> 31:55.620
a strange triangular UFO

31:55.740 --> 31:58.290
above the nuclear weapons
storage depot

31:58.410 --> 32:00.580
at Woodbridge Air Force base
in the U.K.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.750
An even more
frightening incident

32:05.880 --> 32:09.380
happened in the Soviet Union
in 1982.

32:09.510 --> 32:13.840
There, UFOs didn't turn off
the missiles like at Malmstrom,

32:13.970 --> 32:17.220
they turned them on.

32:17.350 --> 32:19.390
A number of the missiles

32:19.520 --> 32:23.150
actually went into
their prelaunch sequence.

32:23.270 --> 32:27.270
And panicked scientists
and military personnel

32:27.400 --> 32:31.400
were rushing around desperately
trying to shut things down,

32:31.530 --> 32:35.530
fearing that whatever was going
on here was going to lead,

32:35.660 --> 32:40.370
perhaps, to nuclear war
and Armageddon.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.750
NARRATOR: With the fall of
the Soviet Union in 1991,

32:43.870 --> 32:46.880
the Cold War came to an end.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.630
Unfortunately, the world's
deadly nuclear arsenal

32:50.760 --> 32:53.470
did not diminish,
as many had hoped.

32:53.590 --> 32:56.720
Instead,
nuclear proliferation continued,

32:56.850 --> 32:59.930
and with it, the continued
sightings and reports

33:00.060 --> 33:03.310
of alien interference.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.020
It is my belief
that over the years,

33:07.150 --> 33:10.780
they have catalogued
every nuclear installation

33:10.900 --> 33:13.700
in the whole world to record

33:13.820 --> 33:17.490
what they should expect
in case of an emergency.

33:20.700 --> 33:23.330
NARRATOR: But if extraterrestrials
really are monitoring

33:23.460 --> 33:27.500
Earth's nuclear-armed nations,
what is their agenda?

33:27.630 --> 33:29.540
(man shouts in foreign language)

33:29.670 --> 33:32.010
NARRATOR: Ancient
astronaut theorists suggest

33:32.130 --> 33:34.760
that the best way to understand
the events of today

33:34.880 --> 33:38.300
is by examining those
in the distant past,

33:38.430 --> 33:41.640
and an ancient site that appears
to also have been destroyed

33:41.770 --> 33:44.100
by a nuclear blast.

33:48.690 --> 33:53.110
NARRATOR: Sindh Province,
Southern Pakistan.

33:55.860 --> 34:00.450
These ruins spanning 250 acres
of the Indus River Valley

34:00.580 --> 34:04.330
represent one of the earliest
civilizations in the world.

34:04.450 --> 34:07.170
Known as Mohenjo-daro,

34:07.290 --> 34:09.920
this 4,000-year-old lost city

34:10.040 --> 34:14.260
was first uncovered
by archaeologists in 1922.

34:14.380 --> 34:17.300
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA:
Mohenjo-daro came to a height

34:17.429 --> 34:19.550
around 2000 BCE.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.600
For some reason,
unknown reasons,

34:21.719 --> 34:23.389
it was totally wiped out,
you know.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.690
The whole civilization
vanished, um,

34:26.810 --> 34:29.770
and we do not know why and how.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.360
CHILDRESS: When British archeologists
first excavated Mohenjo-daro,

34:33.480 --> 34:35.400
what they found astonished them.

34:35.530 --> 34:39.159
And that was that people were
just lying dead in the streets,

34:39.280 --> 34:42.489
sometimes holding hands.

34:42.620 --> 34:47.250
It was like some terrible doom
had just totally wiped out

34:47.370 --> 34:50.500
this entire city and everyone
was just instantly dead.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.090
NARRATOR:
In 1979,

34:54.210 --> 34:56.880
British researcher
David Davenport published

34:57.010 --> 35:00.890
startling findings about
the demise of Mohenjo-daro.

35:01.010 --> 35:04.890
He revealed that there was a
kind of epicenter in the ruins,

35:05.020 --> 35:07.600
approximately 50 yards wide,

35:07.730 --> 35:09.890
where pottery,
stones and other objects

35:10.020 --> 35:12.980
were melted on one side.

35:13.110 --> 35:16.360
Many appeared crystallized
and fused together,

35:16.480 --> 35:20.740
as though subjected
to instantaneous, extreme heat.

35:20.860 --> 35:24.240
Davenport concluded
that this ancient civilization

35:24.370 --> 35:26.080
must have been destroyed

35:26.200 --> 35:29.410
by a nuclear explosion.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.250
By finding fused bricks,

35:33.380 --> 35:36.000
vitrified walls,

35:36.130 --> 35:40.130
pottery vessels
that had completely melted

35:40.260 --> 35:43.180
and also skeletons
that were calcified,

35:43.300 --> 35:46.970
and apparently some of them
even still radioactive.

35:47.100 --> 35:51.350
He decided that Mohenjo-daro
had been nuked.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.270
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
In Mohenjo-daro,

35:53.400 --> 35:56.730
you find some of the ruins
which are simply melted stones.

35:56.860 --> 35:58.740
Which means extreme heat

35:58.860 --> 36:01.400
must been developed
to melt the stones.

36:01.530 --> 36:03.620
At that time,
some thousands of years ago,

36:03.740 --> 36:06.660
we humans had no extreme heat,

36:06.790 --> 36:09.250
so it must have
come from a weapon.

36:09.370 --> 36:13.040
NARRATOR: How could a 4,000-year-old
city have been wiped out

36:13.170 --> 36:14.960
by a weapon
that wasn't even developed

36:15.090 --> 36:17.210
until the 20th century?

36:21.510 --> 36:25.010
Some believe the answer may lie
in the ancient Hindu holy book

36:25.140 --> 36:28.060
the <i>Ramayana</i> of Valmiki,

36:28.180 --> 36:31.810
which tells of epic battles
with a monstrous weapon

36:31.940 --> 36:34.810
called the Brahmastra.

36:34.940 --> 36:37.230
SHIMKHADA:
Brahmastra is a weapon

36:37.360 --> 36:40.610
named after Brahma himself,
god Brahma.

36:40.740 --> 36:44.530
It has a heat-seeking device
put into it,

36:44.660 --> 36:47.620
and also motion detecting.

36:47.740 --> 36:49.490
WHITEHEAD:
The fallout from these weapons

36:49.620 --> 36:51.250
are reported in the <i>Ramayana</i>

36:51.370 --> 36:55.170
as lasting for months and years
after the blast.

36:55.290 --> 36:57.210
People's fingernails
were coming off,

36:57.340 --> 36:59.090
people's hair were falling off,

36:59.210 --> 37:02.510
so it's got all the signatures
of an atomic explosion.

37:04.340 --> 37:06.180
MORGAN: The descriptions
of the aftermath

37:06.300 --> 37:08.760
of the use of the Brahmastras

37:08.890 --> 37:13.480
sound just like descriptions
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

37:13.600 --> 37:17.270
NARRATOR: But could such powerful
weapons of mass destruction

37:17.400 --> 37:21.650
have existed on Earth
thousands of years ago?

37:21.780 --> 37:25.280
And is it possible
that the city of Lanka,

37:25.410 --> 37:28.870
where the ancient texts say the
Brahmastra weapon was unleashed,

37:28.990 --> 37:30.910
was not a fictional location,

37:31.040 --> 37:34.790
but the site known today
as Mohenjo-daro?

37:34.910 --> 37:39.630
TSOUKALOS: Those texts are
chock-full with extraterrestrials

37:39.750 --> 37:43.920
or the so-called gods having
waged a war up in the sky

37:44.050 --> 37:46.970
that our ancestors
actually witnessed.

37:49.220 --> 37:53.270
When you combine the physical
evidence and you combine that

37:53.390 --> 37:55.940
with ancient written documents,

37:56.060 --> 37:59.900
perhaps what we have here
are descriptions

38:00.020 --> 38:01.650
of weapons of mass destruction.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.030
NARRATOR:
In 2016,

38:05.150 --> 38:08.110
researchers in India announced
that carbon dating

38:08.240 --> 38:11.580
of pottery and animal remains
revealed Mohenjo-daro

38:11.700 --> 38:14.830
could be as many
as 8,000 years old,

38:14.950 --> 38:19.080
2,500 years older
than previously thought.

38:19.210 --> 38:23.300
Some ancient astronaut theorists
believe it could be even older,

38:23.420 --> 38:27.130
perhaps dating to a time before
the so-called "great flood"

38:27.260 --> 38:30.220
as described in numerous
religious texts.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.810
But even if such
a startling notion is true,

38:33.930 --> 38:36.100
how was Mohenjo-daro destroyed?

38:36.230 --> 38:37.810
Was it a natural event?

38:39.850 --> 38:42.570
Or was it the result of some
kind of nuclear accident...

38:44.480 --> 38:46.740
or act of war?

38:46.860 --> 38:49.610
HELLYER: I think atomic weapons
have been used on Earth

38:49.740 --> 38:52.700
many times
over thousands of years.

38:52.830 --> 38:56.960
The aliens were concerned
every time that happens.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.120
NARRATOR: If an ancient
civilization was destroyed

39:00.250 --> 39:02.750
by some kind
of nuclear incident,

39:02.880 --> 39:05.460
did it happen
as the result of human warfare

39:05.590 --> 39:08.300
or an extraterrestrial attack?

39:08.420 --> 39:12.100
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

39:12.220 --> 39:14.930
the answer to this question
must be found

39:15.060 --> 39:18.020
before it's too late.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.780
NARRATOR:
Washington, D.C..

39:27.940 --> 39:31.450
May 2013.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.330
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity to speak.

39:34.450 --> 39:37.120
NARRATOR: Former Canadian
Defense Minister Paul Hellyer

39:37.250 --> 39:40.000
addresses the Citizen Hearing
on Disclosure,

39:40.120 --> 39:43.210
a weeklong conference
centered on UFO sightings

39:43.330 --> 39:45.420
and government transparency.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.340
We live in a cosmos
teeming with life.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.380
The fact that some other
civilizations are more advanced

39:50.510 --> 39:52.760
than we are may be humbling.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.140
NARRATOR:
Based on the information

39:54.260 --> 39:56.720
that he has been presented with
over the years,

39:56.850 --> 39:59.020
Hellyer believes that
extraterrestrials

39:59.140 --> 40:00.640
are concerned about Earth

40:00.770 --> 40:03.610
because of previous
devastations.

40:05.400 --> 40:09.070
I think several species
throughout history,

40:09.190 --> 40:12.030
both on this planet
and other planets,

40:12.160 --> 40:14.530
have used nuclear weapons

40:14.660 --> 40:17.830
and have really destroyed

40:17.950 --> 40:20.960
their planets
as a habitable place.

40:21.080 --> 40:25.460
And some of the people
who have been visiting here

40:25.590 --> 40:27.960
have gone through that
and understand it,

40:28.090 --> 40:31.800
don't want it to happen again
on Earth...

40:33.090 --> 40:37.430
because the cosmos is a unity.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.770
It's all one creation.

40:40.890 --> 40:45.150
And anything that happens
anywhere affects other planets,

40:45.270 --> 40:48.980
other species
all throughout the cosmos.

40:49.110 --> 40:51.990
SALAS:
I think we're being observed

40:52.110 --> 40:54.450
to see if we can get through
this period,

40:54.570 --> 40:57.490
of dealing with these weapons
and actually eliminating it.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.500
And that's a big test for us.

41:00.620 --> 41:04.000
HOWE:
They want to see humans advance.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.540
They want us to get past war.

41:06.670 --> 41:08.250
That's what they say.

41:08.380 --> 41:12.800
"You have to stop even
considering nuclear warfare

41:12.920 --> 41:15.930
"because you do not
understand, humans,

41:16.050 --> 41:19.220
"that when you split an atom,

41:19.350 --> 41:22.020
"you are tearing
into other dimensions

41:22.140 --> 41:23.600
"where there are
other intelligences,

41:23.730 --> 41:25.770
and we cannot allow that."

41:25.900 --> 41:29.900
NARRATOR: Are extraterrestrials
monitoring our nuclear weapons

41:30.020 --> 41:32.610
not just out of concern
for humanity,

41:32.740 --> 41:35.740
but because they fear
we may one day pose a threat

41:35.860 --> 41:38.240
to life on other planets?

41:38.370 --> 41:42.500
And if so, might they be
withholding the key

41:42.620 --> 41:45.580
to interstellar travel
until we demonstrate

41:45.710 --> 41:48.710
that we can live in peace
with all our neighbors,

41:48.840 --> 41:52.380
both here on Earth and in space?

41:52.510 --> 41:56.300
Perhaps it will only be
when humankind abandons

41:56.430 --> 41:58.640
its most fearsome weapons

41:58.760 --> 42:02.140
that our evolution on Earth
will be complete,

42:02.270 --> 42:06.850
and we will join our alien
ancestors in the stars.
