00:04.192 --> 00:05.250
Hey, guys.

00:05.427 --> 00:06.519
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, judge.

00:10.432 --> 00:12.730
- What's with Dan?
- Dan is depressed.

00:12.901 --> 00:14.368
Hey, Dan, look.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.937
"Forty trampled
at Mostly Mozart concert."

00:21.476 --> 00:24.036
I don't get it.
This stuff usually perks him right up.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.180
Dan, if you'd rather
not talk about it...

00:27.349 --> 00:30.284
There's an old lady
whose sole means of support is her farm...

00:30.452 --> 00:33.182
...and a 75-year-old husband.
He died yesterday.

00:33.922 --> 00:36.254
Sorry, Dan.
Is this a relative we're talking about?

00:36.424 --> 00:38.892
This is a tax shelter we're talking about.

00:39.494 --> 00:43.089
I could pick up the widow's property
for a song, syndicate the avocado farm...

00:43.264 --> 00:45.824
...set myself up as general partner
and make a mint.

00:46.001 --> 00:47.832
- But?
- My phones are out.

00:48.003 --> 00:50.995
The investment opportunity of a lifetime
is passing me by.

00:51.172 --> 00:53.572
My condolences.

01:00.982 --> 01:02.882
Dan Fielding?

01:05.486 --> 01:08.752
Your facial's been moved up to 4:30.

01:10.325 --> 01:12.418
Oh, and Betty called.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.964
That's for last night.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

02:15.557 --> 02:19.288
It is incredible what they're doing with
the size of personal computers nowadays.

02:21.129 --> 02:23.927
I'm what you might call an aficionado.

02:25.366 --> 02:27.095
Do you know what that word means?

02:29.704 --> 02:32.969
Do you know what that word means?

02:38.446 --> 02:40.437
Come here, little boy.

02:40.615 --> 02:45.746
For your edification,
this is a 16 bit CPM with 64K RAM...

02:45.920 --> 02:48.445
...and has floppy
or hard disk capabilities.

02:48.623 --> 02:51.751
Any other questions, keyboard face?

02:52.861 --> 02:54.954
There is no Santa,
the Easter Bunny is dead...

02:55.130 --> 02:58.258
...and Kermit the Frog wears dresses.

03:00.568 --> 03:02.968
Don't you talk to strangers, Jeremy.

03:03.138 --> 03:05.163
JEREMY: Mom, he was telling me
obscene stories.

03:05.974 --> 03:07.874
[LAUGHING]

03:08.543 --> 03:11.444
Kids say the darnedest things,
don't they?

03:11.613 --> 03:13.706
Counselor, I would appreciate it...

03:13.882 --> 03:18.182
...if you would refrain from any
pre-trial discussion with my client.

03:18.353 --> 03:20.878
Well, Jeremy, this is our big day.

03:21.055 --> 03:23.353
We're going to work
real closely together.

03:23.525 --> 03:26.688
In that case, pop a breath mint.

03:29.197 --> 03:31.825
You gotta love the little tyke, don't you?

03:33.001 --> 03:36.596
- I think kids are great, they're a joy.
- Yeah.

03:36.771 --> 03:40.867
I understand you have to
have them with a man.

03:42.310 --> 03:44.505
I believe so.

03:45.146 --> 03:47.580
What a shame.

03:49.984 --> 03:53.181
- What's the next case, Mac?
- Alan and Phyllis Simon, Your Honor.

03:53.354 --> 03:55.948
They're charged
with assaulting Anthony Porcaro...

03:56.124 --> 03:58.592
...their son's elementary school principal.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.695
Problems with that new math,
Mr. And Mrs. Simon?

04:01.863 --> 04:04.195
Your Honor, apparently
the defendants were upset...

04:04.365 --> 04:06.492
...when my client decided
to suspend their son.

04:06.668 --> 04:08.761
- So Mrs. Simon...
- That's Ms. Simon.

04:08.937 --> 04:11.770
My mistake.

04:14.309 --> 04:20.373
Ms. Simon registered dissent by
bludgeoning Mr. Porcaro with an almanac.

04:21.416 --> 04:24.283
Very resourceful. Get it?

04:24.919 --> 04:27.479
Almanac, resourceful.

04:27.956 --> 04:31.551
Your Honor, the defendants freely admit
that they overreacted...

04:31.726 --> 04:34.695
...as would any parent
when the issue is their child's welfare.

04:34.862 --> 04:38.798
His child's welfare.
Let's watch our grammar.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.632
Your Honor, comma...

04:44.272 --> 04:46.536
...the Simons' actions
were unpremeditated.

04:46.708 --> 04:50.337
And if it pleases the court, their son Jeremy
is available for testimony.

04:50.511 --> 04:52.172
Bull, you wanna bring him on over?

04:53.381 --> 04:55.349
Let's go, little fella.

05:02.490 --> 05:04.287
I meant him.

05:04.792 --> 05:07.226
Didn't I see you
in the Museum of Natural History?

05:07.395 --> 05:10.592
- Could be.
- Neanderthal man, right?

05:12.133 --> 05:15.728
Why don't you re-read
<i>Jack and the Beanstalk?</i>

05:20.275 --> 05:22.266
Hi there, Jeremy. My name's Harry.

05:22.443 --> 05:24.138
I'm a municipal court judge.

05:24.312 --> 05:26.837
This is arraignment court, right?

05:27.015 --> 05:29.074
That's absolutely correct, Jeremy.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.582
So you're pretty much
small potatoes, aren't you?

05:34.589 --> 05:36.989
Nice talking with you.

05:37.692 --> 05:39.489
Why exactly was he suspended?

05:39.661 --> 05:43.290
Your Honor, he accessed the basketball
scoreboard with his computer.

05:43.464 --> 05:48.561
He then printed out during a game
that Mr. Porcaro wears a toupee.

05:48.736 --> 05:51.637
- Really?
- I do not.

05:51.806 --> 05:53.706
Fine. Where were we?

05:53.875 --> 05:56.571
- The guy with the toup said...
HARRY: Oh, yeah, I remember.

05:57.812 --> 05:59.973
Well, high-spiritedness aside, Jeremy...

06:00.148 --> 06:03.811
...you realize that your prank might
have been in violation of FCC regulations.

06:03.985 --> 06:07.182
The FCC does not consider scoreboards
a broadcast medium.

06:08.156 --> 06:10.590
- Thank you.
- The Communications Act stipulates...

06:10.758 --> 06:13.158
I said, thank you, little boy.

06:14.762 --> 06:18.357
Folks, what is really the problem here?
He was only suspended for one day.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.696
We're talking about a blot
on his permanent record.

06:21.869 --> 06:24.497
You creamed this guy over a blot?

06:24.672 --> 06:27.266
How will that blot look
when he applies to Princeton?

06:27.442 --> 06:29.842
How will that look
when it comes down to a choice...

06:30.011 --> 06:33.412
...between our child
and some illiterate twit...

06:33.581 --> 06:35.674
...whose father just donated a library?

06:35.850 --> 06:38.546
I mean, I just own a small antique
furniture company.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.779
I love antique furniture.

06:41.589 --> 06:44.820
I could redo your office, at cost.

06:44.992 --> 06:47.790
- Now, folks, the issue here...
- Really?

06:47.962 --> 06:50.226
I suppose it would save
the taxpayers money.

06:50.398 --> 06:54.892
- I suppose so, Mr. Porcaro...
- Perhaps suspension was too harsh.

06:55.069 --> 06:57.128
Perhaps, but in regards to the parents...

06:57.305 --> 07:00.866
...there's certainly no justification
for violence against a school official.

07:02.076 --> 07:06.035
- I've always wanted a Louis XVI desk.
- No problem.

07:06.214 --> 07:10.344
- When did I lose control?
- Oh, early on, sir.

07:10.918 --> 07:13.512
Of course I must insist
on an apology too.

07:13.688 --> 07:15.519
Of course. Dear?

07:15.690 --> 07:16.850
You creamed him.

07:17.024 --> 07:21.256
I'm sorry I bashed you, Mr. Porcaro.

07:21.996 --> 07:23.463
Accepted.

07:23.631 --> 07:25.690
I wish to drop the charges, Your Honor.

07:25.867 --> 07:28.529
Glad I could be of help. Case dismissed.

07:28.703 --> 07:30.671
You mean that's it? I got away with it?

07:30.838 --> 07:33.329
You got an angel on your shoulder.
You're out of here.

07:33.508 --> 07:35.135
Let's go, let's go.

07:35.743 --> 07:38.075
- You didn't gavel.
- Excuse me?

07:38.246 --> 07:41.238
Technically, the case isn't dismissed
until you use the gavel.

07:43.284 --> 07:45.377
Oh, go ahead.

07:49.624 --> 07:52.320
I'll see you're out in two years.

07:54.228 --> 07:56.560
Psst. Psst-psst.

08:00.802 --> 08:03.327
- What?
- I made dinner reservations.

08:03.504 --> 08:05.404
Window seats.

08:05.573 --> 08:08.041
- How about my 10 bucks?
- No, 5 now.

08:08.209 --> 08:10.302
Five when the California call
comes through.

08:11.312 --> 08:13.837
Investing in avocados, huh?

08:14.148 --> 08:17.311
Do you think that wise,
what with six bumper crops in a row?

08:19.387 --> 08:21.617
I got a tip at the mission.

08:22.457 --> 08:23.481
What's next, Mac?

08:23.658 --> 08:29.255
If he had not plowed with my heifer,
he had not found out my riddle.

08:29.430 --> 08:30.863
That's what they all say.

08:31.032 --> 08:35.731
Ralph Kremski, Your Honor.
Planet of origin unknown.

08:36.471 --> 08:39.405
Would ye tamper with the wages of sin?

08:39.573 --> 08:42.236
Would ye force his terrible hand?

08:42.409 --> 08:46.176
I'll have to get back to ye on that one.

08:47.448 --> 08:51.009
Apparently, Mr. Kremski was arrested
for distributing religious literature...

08:51.185 --> 08:53.983
...without a license
at the Port Authority terminal.

08:54.155 --> 08:56.988
Your Honor, I move
that the case be dismissed.

08:57.158 --> 09:00.924
Answer, lest ye call down his wrath.

09:01.996 --> 09:06.262
Need I remind ye, Mr. Kremski,
that ye are in a court of law.

09:07.702 --> 09:10.068
This isn't Penn Station?

09:10.705 --> 09:13.265
No. Just an incredible simulation.

09:14.308 --> 09:16.776
Officials felt Mr. Kremski
was harassing passengers.

09:16.944 --> 09:20.778
He does purport to be affiliated
with a legitimate religious organization.

09:20.948 --> 09:24.645
- Which is?
- The Church of Ralph.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.481
Yes, I just got back from
some missionary work in New Jersey.

09:29.957 --> 09:30.981
That's great.

09:31.158 --> 09:33.456
I'm gonna have to go
for that psychiatric evaluation.

09:33.628 --> 09:34.822
BULL:
Hey, come back here, kid.

09:34.996 --> 09:36.793
MS. SIMON: Jeremy, no.
MR. SIMON: What are you doing?

09:36.964 --> 09:38.761
No, don't go in there.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.501
What is it, Bull?

09:44.405 --> 09:46.270
Mr. Porcaro.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.204
- The rest of him is outside in the corridor.
- What happened?

09:49.377 --> 09:53.211
The Simon boy grabbed it, handed it off
to me and locked himself in your chambers.

09:54.282 --> 09:55.749
We'll take a recess.

09:58.819 --> 10:03.256
Do not use his name in vain,
and do not lay down with beasts.

10:05.693 --> 10:08.184
We only had drinks.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.760
Young man,
you open the door this instant.

10:14.602 --> 10:16.900
Let me handle this.

10:21.008 --> 10:25.172
Jeremy, this is Bull.

10:29.150 --> 10:33.143
Open up or I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your ho...

10:33.621 --> 10:37.057
He read Dante's <i>Inferno</i> at age 10.

10:37.825 --> 10:39.588
Never mind.

10:40.628 --> 10:42.095
You got a bobby pin?

10:42.263 --> 10:44.527
Oh. Forget it.

10:49.003 --> 10:50.027
There we go.

10:52.673 --> 10:54.231
Jeremy, what are you doing?

10:54.408 --> 10:56.467
He's plugged his computer
into the phone.

10:56.644 --> 10:58.578
This is my statement.

10:58.746 --> 11:02.079
"To express my contempt
for the entire school system...

11:02.249 --> 11:05.150
...I have taken
their computer records hostage."

11:06.287 --> 11:11.054
With a single keystroke
I can wipe them out, grades and all.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.166
Well, Mr. Platt, you're the expert.

11:22.336 --> 11:25.828
I've seen kids break into computers
in department stores, airlines, banks...

11:26.007 --> 11:28.771
...but I've never seen anything like this.

11:28.943 --> 11:31.969
These records
have completely disappeared.

11:33.447 --> 11:35.574
This is beautiful.

11:37.018 --> 11:41.045
Hi, guys. So the little gerbil give in yet?

11:41.922 --> 11:45.153
I could turn your credit rating
into garbage, Fielding.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.290
Uncle Dan was just kidding.

11:49.697 --> 11:54.259
- Jeremy, what is it you want from us?
- Here's a list of my demands.

11:55.836 --> 11:59.135
"A quarter of a million dollars
in unmarked bills...

11:59.306 --> 12:04.334
...a fueled-up 747 and a Creamsicle."

12:05.079 --> 12:09.812
- A quarter of a million?
- Have you spent all of your allowance?

12:10.351 --> 12:11.648
How about we make a deal?

12:11.819 --> 12:14.413
You put the records back
and you and I will talk, okay?

12:15.956 --> 12:18.720
Dan, I got the coast on booth two...

12:19.427 --> 12:20.758
I've come at a bad time.

12:21.162 --> 12:22.720
Harry, I've gotta take this.

12:22.897 --> 12:25.491
As long as you're going,
take Jeremy to the cafeteria...

12:25.666 --> 12:27.258
...and get him that Creamsicle.

12:27.435 --> 12:28.697
Oh, come on, Harry.

12:28.869 --> 12:30.598
What was it he said
about your credit?

12:32.139 --> 12:34.403
Come on, little buddy.

12:34.575 --> 12:37.237
My treat.

12:37.878 --> 12:39.368
In Manhattan.

12:39.547 --> 12:41.014
The number for The Hair Bazaar.

12:41.882 --> 12:46.251
- It's open till 9.
- Don't be a jerk.

12:46.787 --> 12:50.279
This drives women wild.

12:51.726 --> 12:53.091
Really?

12:53.260 --> 12:58.254
I never played basketball
because I didn't have time.

13:01.635 --> 13:02.897
Aha.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.503
I think I've broken the code.

13:06.941 --> 13:10.035
One more command and ta-da.

13:10.211 --> 13:15.012
- Strategic Air Command?
- Oh, fudge.

13:16.350 --> 13:20.150
Sy, Sy, Sy.

13:20.321 --> 13:24.553
I am sure we discussed
a 15 percent management fee but...

13:24.725 --> 13:26.283
I'm thirsty, Fielding.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.026
I will get back to you, Sy.

13:32.199 --> 13:34.929
Avocados, huh? Interesting investment.

13:35.102 --> 13:37.070
Just so you know,
there's been six bumper...

13:37.238 --> 13:39.638
I heard, I heard.

13:39.807 --> 13:42.037
Fine, I don't care if you lose your shirt.

13:42.510 --> 13:45.001
Looks like a blend, anyway.

13:47.381 --> 13:49.440
Let's play a little game.

13:49.617 --> 13:53.713
It's called Ax, Ax, Who's Got the Ax?

13:54.421 --> 13:59.757
Dan, I think your personal secretary
is looking for you.

14:04.665 --> 14:05.996
Okay, kid, you win.

14:06.167 --> 14:09.295
They got a jumbo jet fueling up at Kennedy.
Where do you want to go?

14:09.470 --> 14:12.098
Cuba, Algeria?

14:12.273 --> 14:14.468
Disney World?

14:15.376 --> 14:16.741
I haven't decided yet.

14:18.646 --> 14:21.740
- Jeremy, you and I have got to talk.
- Sure.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.544
When I get down to the stick,
your time's up.

14:26.353 --> 14:28.719
- Hey, I wasn't finished.
- Take a seat, ace.

14:28.889 --> 14:30.049
Hey.

14:30.224 --> 14:31.714
Now, I may be small potatoes...

14:31.892 --> 14:34.690
...but I could beat you back
to that computer in a body cast.

14:34.862 --> 14:36.420
Now sit down.

14:36.597 --> 14:38.189
I hope you realize that by noon...

14:38.365 --> 14:41.300
...your savings account
could wind up in Sarajevo.

14:41.468 --> 14:43.459
You really get around on that computer.

14:44.438 --> 14:46.736
Let's just say it's my best friend.

14:46.907 --> 14:49.501
- Kind of like Timmy and Lassie, right?
- Who?

14:49.677 --> 14:52.646
It's an old TV show. A boy and his dog.

14:52.813 --> 14:56.681
- You got a dog?
- Just the one I dissected in Honors Biology.

14:58.519 --> 15:00.384
I named him Sparky.

15:02.756 --> 15:05.520
What do you mean we closed the deal?

15:05.893 --> 15:07.417
My partner? What par...

15:14.568 --> 15:16.763
Mr. Wainwright, I presume?

15:17.204 --> 15:19.399
You can call me Derrell.

15:19.573 --> 15:23.100
- You closed the deal.
- You were busy, I didn't wanna bother you.

15:23.677 --> 15:27.875
Listen, I got you the investment tax credit
and 20 percent of the back end.

15:29.383 --> 15:32.216
I used to be a financial consultant.

15:34.722 --> 15:40.126
Oh, and by the way, I took the liberty
of rescheduling your surgery.

15:40.294 --> 15:44.025
- What?
- Trust me.

15:47.001 --> 15:49.265
So, what about friends?
Do you got any friends?

15:49.436 --> 15:52.132
I mean, other than the one
you plug into a socket?

15:52.573 --> 15:53.972
Take a hike, Harry.

15:54.475 --> 15:58.138
- Translation: No, I don't have any friends.
- Can I have my plane now?

15:58.312 --> 16:00.746
- Sit down.
- Don't touch me, mister.

16:02.283 --> 16:03.409
Ha-ha-ha.

16:03.584 --> 16:05.677
School play.

16:05.986 --> 16:09.183
<i>Oliver!</i> He's got the lead.

16:09.356 --> 16:11.324
It's gonna be terrific.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.959
Income averaging, believe me...

16:13.127 --> 16:15.721
...it would save you
some substantial tax dollars.

16:15.896 --> 16:18.387
- Jeremy.
- I'm busy.

16:18.565 --> 16:20.726
Would you excuse us?

16:20.901 --> 16:22.562
I'd like some privacy, please.

16:22.736 --> 16:25.261
I touched a nerve
when I mentioned friends, didn't I?

16:25.439 --> 16:28.772
Who needs them?
They're all jerks at school anyway.

16:28.943 --> 16:30.274
They don't like you, do they?

16:31.445 --> 16:33.072
Well, guess what.

16:33.247 --> 16:35.613
- I don't like you, either.
- What?

16:35.783 --> 16:38.718
You don't like to have fun.
I don't like anyone that doesn't.

16:38.886 --> 16:41.252
- I do too like to have fun.
- But?

16:41.422 --> 16:45.916
But I don't know how.

16:46.393 --> 16:48.725
- Really?
- Really.

16:49.596 --> 16:51.928
But you said
that scoreboard thing was for fun.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.091
I lied.

16:54.768 --> 16:58.704
It was a semi-conscious
pathetic plea for attention.

17:00.674 --> 17:04.804
Well, that's okay. I lied too.

17:04.979 --> 17:08.346
There ain't no money
and there ain't no plane.

17:08.848 --> 17:11.409
And I never met a kid I didn't like.

17:21.228 --> 17:24.060
Hey, everybody, watch this.

17:25.799 --> 17:27.925
- Are you ready?
- Yup.

17:31.672 --> 17:32.969
Did you see that?

17:34.408 --> 17:36.000
Let me try.

17:36.810 --> 17:39.802
Don't you get it? The kid can't catch.

17:40.514 --> 17:43.176
Good work, sir.

17:43.450 --> 17:45.042
A real breakthrough.

17:46.553 --> 17:49.750
You don't get it, do you? Come here.

17:50.657 --> 17:53.854
A yo-yo. Here.

17:59.199 --> 18:00.598
Here.

18:04.538 --> 18:07.530
Good Lord, it's <i>The Miracle Worker.</i>

18:08.375 --> 18:11.173
Don't you get it? The kid doesn't know
how to play any games.

18:11.345 --> 18:12.778
What do you folks do for fun?

18:12.946 --> 18:17.645
- Well, just last week we...
- The Wolfgang Goethe festival.

18:17.818 --> 18:20.616
Great, did you go on any of the rides?

18:20.788 --> 18:23.416
Come on, that's adult stuff.
I'm talking about kid stuff.

18:23.590 --> 18:27.151
- What did you tell me about baseball?
- Well, they wouldn't let me play.

18:27.327 --> 18:30.455
Well, that's because
we didn't want you to get hurt, dear.

18:30.931 --> 18:33.923
He could've lost his keyboard function.

18:34.101 --> 18:35.693
His keyboard function?

18:35.869 --> 18:38.997
It happens to be
a competitive world out there.

18:39.173 --> 18:40.435
We're just thinking of him.

18:40.607 --> 18:44.407
You want him to be a success at 21
if it means an ulcer at 22.

18:44.578 --> 18:46.705
Why do you think
he acts like such a brat?

18:46.880 --> 18:50.816
- He does not act like a brat.
- I do too.

18:52.252 --> 18:53.276
You do?

18:53.454 --> 18:56.480
- Yeah.
DAN: Oh, yes. Believe me.

18:58.292 --> 19:01.420
He's ticked off and I don't blame him.

19:01.595 --> 19:04.086
He's missing out on all the fun.
So are you guys.

19:04.264 --> 19:06.664
Don't you ever do anything off the wall?

19:06.834 --> 19:07.960
MR. SIMON: What?
- Off the wall?

19:08.135 --> 19:12.936
Yeah, off the wall. Like you pull up to a toll
booth and you pay for the car behind you.

19:13.107 --> 19:17.806
Or you walk up Fifth Avenue backwards
just to get a look at people's faces.

19:17.978 --> 19:19.946
Or you moon someone.

19:21.882 --> 19:23.645
Moon someone? What's that?

19:23.817 --> 19:27.014
Well, you drop your pants
and you stick your...

19:27.821 --> 19:30.483
It'll be covered in Drivers' Ed.

19:31.391 --> 19:33.586
You are in an influential position,
Your Honor.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.853
I don't think
you're setting the best example.

19:36.029 --> 19:38.190
Hey, listen, sister.

19:38.765 --> 19:40.232
I can tell you one thing...

19:40.400 --> 19:45.394
...he didn't get his job by winning
a contest on the back of a cereal box.

19:47.841 --> 19:51.277
And if he says fun is important,
it's important.

19:51.445 --> 19:54.642
Conceptually I understand your logic,
but if we're to be pragmatic...

19:55.315 --> 19:58.876
Pragmatic.
Oh, you wanna see pragmatic, huh?

19:59.052 --> 20:01.520
Harry, what was that
you said about mooning?

20:01.688 --> 20:06.716
- Oh, that was a figure of speech...
- Well, not to me it wasn't.

20:09.163 --> 20:12.257
Look at me, New York.

20:16.203 --> 20:19.138
Is this what I fought for?

20:21.208 --> 20:23.472
I feel cleansed.

20:23.644 --> 20:27.580
- I did that once in a Studebaker.
- Oh, yeah?

20:27.748 --> 20:31.309
Almost lost control of the car.

20:33.253 --> 20:36.484
Phyllis, look. He's smiling.

20:36.657 --> 20:39.023
When was the last time he did that?

20:39.393 --> 20:40.826
I don't know.

20:40.994 --> 20:45.931
Well, I guess we haven't been exactly
fun people, have we, Phyllis?

20:46.099 --> 20:47.430
No.

20:47.601 --> 20:51.002
Not unless you count the night
your small business loan came through.

20:51.171 --> 20:53.298
He made me put on
my old cheerleader outfit...

20:53.473 --> 20:55.031
Phyllis.

20:57.978 --> 21:02.108
Jeremy, we're sorry.

21:02.449 --> 21:04.246
How can we rectify the dilemma?

21:04.418 --> 21:08.878
Forget about rectifying your dilemma.
Take the kid to a Knicks game.

21:09.056 --> 21:12.423
- I love football.
- Basketball.

21:12.593 --> 21:15.391
- Whatever.
- Could we go this weekend, Dad?

21:15.562 --> 21:17.154
- Sure.
- Great.

21:17.731 --> 21:19.722
I'll get the seats.

21:23.203 --> 21:24.295
Loge or mezzanine?

21:24.471 --> 21:27.338
Jeremy, why don't you buy the tickets
when you get there, huh?

21:27.774 --> 21:30.800
- Yes, sir.
- And if you don't mind?

21:30.978 --> 21:32.605
Oh, sure.

21:32.779 --> 21:36.010
There, the school records are back.

21:36.183 --> 21:40.017
- You punched the letter F?
- Tricky, huh?

21:40.187 --> 21:42.553
The letter F?

21:43.023 --> 21:48.188
So simple. So elegant.

21:49.396 --> 21:51.261
Excuse me.

21:52.032 --> 21:53.499
Let's go, Jeremy.

21:53.667 --> 21:58.400
Oh, and thank you, Your Honor.
I think we've all learned something today.

21:58.572 --> 21:59.732
- Come on.
- Come on, son.

21:59.906 --> 22:04.104
Well, there's still that matter
of the illegal break-in, Mr. Porcaro.

22:04.278 --> 22:07.042
Forget it. He's learned his lesson.

22:07.214 --> 22:09.045
I know I have.

22:12.552 --> 22:15.453
Listen, everybody,
I know I was a little snotty before...

22:15.622 --> 22:19.353
...and I'd like to apologize
to Billie and Bull.

22:19.526 --> 22:21.050
And most of all you, Harry.

22:22.129 --> 22:24.927
- What about me?
- Don't hold your breath, fish face.

22:27.934 --> 22:30.562
The kid's gonna be all right.

22:31.438 --> 22:33.269
Let's get back to work, huh?

22:33.440 --> 22:35.567
MAN 1:
Look at me, New York.

22:35.742 --> 22:37.141
We're being mooned, people.

22:37.311 --> 22:39.279
WOMAN 1:
Look at me, New York.

22:39.446 --> 22:41.710
In the city hall building,
there's a bare behind.

22:42.349 --> 22:46.911
No, I think that's Mayor Koch
combing his hair.

22:47.087 --> 22:50.250
MAN 2: Look at me, New York.
- That's the Hall of Records.

22:50.424 --> 22:53.757
Hey, it looks like Candy. Hey, Candy!

22:53.927 --> 22:57.021
WOMAN 2: Look at me, New York.
MAN 3: Look at me, New York.

22:57.197 --> 22:59.688
WOMAN 3: Look at me, New York.
MAN 4: Look at me, New York.

22:59.866 --> 23:02.460
There are eight million stories
in the naked city.

23:04.705 --> 23:06.764
[BULL LAUGHS]

23:07.674 --> 23:09.938
Somebody had to say it.

23:10.110 --> 23:12.670
MAN 5: Look at me, New York.
WOMAN 4: Look at me, New York.

23:12.846 --> 23:15.576
MAN 6:
Look at me, New York.
