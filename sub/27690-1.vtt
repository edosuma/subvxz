00:43.791 --> 00:45.416
Excuse me, can we

00:46.166 --> 00:46.875
pull over please?

00:49.416 --> 00:51.041
Can we stop the car please?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.500
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

03:20.666 --> 03:22.623
Ciao bella! Wow.

03:22.625 --> 03:24.000
How are you? Where are you from?

03:25.708 --> 03:27.000
Sorry, where are you from?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.498
- Please. Please.
- Argentina.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.666
Argentina, wow,
it's so beautiful, like you.

03:33.416 --> 03:34.666
Don't worry. What's your name?

03:35.041 --> 03:35.833
Sorry sir, I'm just...

03:36.083 --> 03:37.541
Please, please, just a name.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.583
- Emma.
- Oh, Emma.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
One moment please.
I have a poem for you, okay?

03:44.500 --> 03:45.248
Okay.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.583
That's a brilliant poem.

03:56.541 --> 03:57.748
- Beautiful.
- Nice to meet you.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.706
Nice to meet you.
Sorry, sir, I'm just...

03:59.708 --> 04:02.164
- I'm kind of in a rush, so...
- Okay, I help you.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.081
No. no.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.250
- Upstairs?
- No, no, no.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.456
I'm okay, but thank
you for your help.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.998
Jesus.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.333
I don't know what
you're saying!

04:13.541 --> 04:15.623
20 you give me. I help you.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.248
- 20? For what?
- For help you!

04:19.750 --> 04:21.750
- Okay, okay.
- 20 euros.

04:22.458 --> 04:25.875
Jesus Christ. Okay, okay.

05:20.333 --> 05:21.416
Oh shit.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.208
Hello?

05:40.541 --> 05:43.500
Benedetta? Hi, it's Emma Morgan.

05:45.708 --> 05:49.875
Yeah, I'm actually in Italy.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.998
Yeah, there are some
things I needed to do

05:54.000 --> 05:56.333
so it all worked out
perfect timing.

06:04.666 --> 06:08.708
Okay so the day after tomorrow.
What time?

06:09.833 --> 06:10.666
Ten?

06:11.625 --> 06:12.500
Okay, cool.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.083
Last time we spoke you
said that you think that...

06:19.458 --> 06:19.833
sorry...

06:20.708 --> 06:22.208
that they're close to buying?

06:25.208 --> 06:26.375
Perfect.

06:37.041 --> 06:38.041
Emma.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.541
Ginevra.

06:42.166 --> 06:47.708
So strange to see you I was
just in the neighborhood.

06:48.916 --> 06:50.791
You look exactly
like your mother.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.166
Come on, let's
have a cup of tea.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.208
I remember you were such a good
student. Do you still play?

06:59.666 --> 07:02.500
No. I hardly remember
anything anymore.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.208
Don't you miss New York?

07:05.041 --> 07:05.666
No, I love it here.

07:07.291 --> 07:08.458
I've never been happier.

07:11.916 --> 07:13.750
You don't have to lie to me.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.625
Everywhere I go it's
the same feeling.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.250
I get caught in this
loop, I can't...

07:42.250 --> 07:43.416
I can't describe it.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.750
I got fired from my
job in New York.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.498
Just came here without
having a second thought

07:51.500 --> 07:52.833
and now I find
myself here and...

07:58.833 --> 08:01.541
I just sort of drift
from place to place

08:02.458 --> 08:04.208
without feeling anything.

08:08.416 --> 08:09.541
Does it get better?

09:45.666 --> 09:47.708
I need to get this repaired.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.458
Please could I have
another glass of wine?

13:55.041 --> 13:55.916
Hello?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.333
Hello?

15:09.791 --> 15:11.000
Please, sit down.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
I only stopped by to
pick something up.

15:36.916 --> 15:39.583
Tancredi. I thought
you'd be hungry.

15:40.166 --> 15:44.083
Emma. I was just
about to leave.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.916
Can I take you for
a glass of wine?

16:13.583 --> 16:14.750
Where do you live?

16:18.541 --> 16:19.375
Thanks.

19:07.625 --> 19:08.416
Here.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.416
Thank you, I owe you a drink.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.208
You can get a lot around
here for 20 euros.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.206
They give me such a dark vibe.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.083
What's that?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.333
Oh, it's funny, it's a joke.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.083
Guys, welcome!

20:16.916 --> 20:18.123
Nice to meet you. Hey.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.708
Nice to meet you, too.

20:45.750 --> 20:46.750
Emma.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.333
You want a mussel?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.123
Do you know that we also call...

20:51.125 --> 20:52.208
whatever, I'm not going
to go into details.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.331
No but normally we call
ugly girls mussels.

20:57.333 --> 20:57.875
Why?

20:59.291 --> 21:00.041
First of all because they're
ugly if you open them.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.500
And second because

21:02.916 --> 21:04.498
mussels, they stick on the rock,
and normally ugly girls,

21:04.500 --> 21:06.250
they stick on you after you
have sex with them. But...

21:08.208 --> 21:09.916
Do you want more pasta? Is
this enough? Come here.

21:13.291 --> 21:15.625
Lollo, which third world
country were you...

21:15.875 --> 21:17.708
I forgot to serve myself!

21:36.083 --> 21:38.125
Isn't this place just amazing?

21:39.250 --> 21:40.875
You don't have any idea.

21:41.458 --> 21:44.998
In years past you could
hardly get a table here...

21:45.000 --> 21:46.666
I have a piece
of fish in my...

21:46.916 --> 21:48.625
So thank God for the recession

21:50.708 --> 21:53.791
we can buy everything because
everything is so cheap.

21:55.541 --> 21:56.458
That's the best part.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.458
I'm gonna choke.

22:05.416 --> 22:07.625
Lollo too if he does
it in the proper way!

22:54.166 --> 22:55.333
Here you go.

23:23.125 --> 23:24.125
I am.

23:26.375 --> 23:27.500
Thank you, God.

23:38.541 --> 23:39.708
Come on.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.039
Piece of shit money.

23:44.041 --> 23:46.083
I have coins, I have coins.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.208
Lapo, I have coins.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.375
Well thank you.

23:55.583 --> 23:56.750
Is it even Sunday?

24:02.250 --> 24:03.498
Who gives a shit!

24:03.500 --> 24:05.373
I don't have any idea guys.

24:05.375 --> 24:06.916
I don't fucking give a shit.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.748
Come on Lapo let's go.

24:30.750 --> 24:32.123
Let's go!

24:32.125 --> 24:34.041
I'm not going anywhere
until I have my vodka tonic.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.500
I'm fine, I'm fine.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.583
You have a brother?

25:05.000 --> 25:05.500
Yeah.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.373
He's great.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.000
He's a liability.

25:09.458 --> 25:12.041
This is much better.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.166
Too many people at the umbrella.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.625
We can have a relaxed
aperitivo here.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.706
Speak in English Tancredi.

25:18.708 --> 25:19.956
He's so rude.

25:19.958 --> 25:21.500
It's okay. I understand
a bit of Italian.

25:24.541 --> 25:25.125
How?

25:26.125 --> 25:27.291
She used to live in Florence.

25:27.791 --> 25:29.333
That doesn't mean anything.

25:29.625 --> 25:31.289
Anyway, we speak
like peasants.

25:31.291 --> 25:33.456
Out of Tuscany nobody
understands us.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.125
Nobody
understands you.

25:35.416 --> 25:37.248
Lapo thinks he's
going to be a diplomat

25:37.250 --> 25:38.873
and that's why when he
drinks he speaks like

25:38.875 --> 25:40.458
an Albanian with a
Milanese accent.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.789
Tancredi had an existential
crisis when he was a teenager

25:43.791 --> 25:46.498
and that's why he ran away to a
boarding school for eight years.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.125
You want to be a diplomat?

25:49.583 --> 25:50.750
What do you do Emma?

25:51.625 --> 25:53.206
You don't even
know what she does?

25:53.208 --> 25:55.039
- Consulting.
- Cool.

25:55.041 --> 25:56.041
No, not really.

25:56.416 --> 25:57.541
I just quit my job.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.123
Oh, so you're just
here traveling and...

26:00.125 --> 26:01.498
I don't know.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.125
Right now I don't seem to be
doing much of anything.

26:03.791 --> 26:05.000
That's perfect.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.875
In Italy no one ever
does anything.

30:17.541 --> 30:18.708
Do you have an extra?

30:19.625 --> 30:20.375
No.

30:21.541 --> 30:22.708
Can I sit?

30:46.291 --> 30:47.458
I ran away too, you know.

30:48.291 --> 30:49.166
Six years.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.458
What makes you
think I ran away?

31:03.166 --> 31:09.500
You might find when you go
back that little has changed.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.208
I'd have no way of knowing.

32:18.208 --> 32:19.375
I love this dress.

32:20.291 --> 32:22.208
It was my mother's.

32:25.541 --> 32:28.791
What do you know about
Poggio Imperiale?

32:29.666 --> 32:31.039
That's where the rich kids go

32:31.041 --> 32:33.081
when they can't
pass their exams.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.708
They're hiring an
English teacher.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.500
This close to the school year?

32:38.541 --> 32:39.914
I'm good with books.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.500
And I could use a
source of income.

32:42.416 --> 32:43.541
You can move in with me.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.000
It's important that
I keep the house.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.750
What I'm saying is
you don't need to.

33:30.291 --> 33:33.081
Darling can you put the roast
back in the oven please?

33:33.083 --> 33:34.541
- Have you turned it already?
- Yeah.

33:45.708 --> 33:46.708
Are you okay?

33:50.041 --> 33:51.208
What's that?

33:51.541 --> 33:53.291
I don't know!

33:56.083 --> 33:57.000
What are you doing?

34:00.666 --> 34:02.666
It's gauze.

34:42.708 --> 34:44.708
I'm sure that Emma will
be happy to help you out.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.250
Of course. Yes.

35:06.958 --> 35:08.875
Would
anybody like dessert?

35:11.708 --> 35:12.875
Yes please.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.125
- Let me help you.
- Oh no, leave it.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.000
Boring.

37:48.291 --> 37:49.458
By the way, Emma.

37:50.833 --> 37:54.458
Tancredi fancies himself too
much of an intellectual

37:54.916 --> 37:56.000
to make you drop your decision.

39:27.916 --> 39:31.500
I studied comparative
literature at Dartmouth

39:32.458 --> 39:34.666
with an emphasis in
literary theory.

39:39.291 --> 39:40.750
I worked in consulting

39:41.083 --> 39:43.500
but I didn't find the
work stimulating.

39:44.541 --> 39:49.291
I do, however, have
experience teaching English

39:49.541 --> 39:52.000
in South America on
one of my leave terms.

41:30.500 --> 41:35.333
That villa belonged to one of
the oldest families in Florence.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.500
The problem with the old
families is that no one works.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.039
Ten years ago the man
who owned that villa

41:43.041 --> 41:44.664
realized he had to sell it.

41:44.666 --> 41:46.081
But he waited too long

41:46.083 --> 41:49.248
so he sold it as is with
everything inside

41:49.250 --> 41:51.166
for around twenty million euros.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.833
And the man who bought it,
some German investor,

41:55.291 --> 41:58.291
he sold half the furniture
inside for guess how much?

41:59.166 --> 42:00.041
Ten?

42:00.500 --> 42:01.625
More than twenty million.

42:03.208 --> 42:06.041
What kind of an idiot could
let something like that happen?

42:09.750 --> 42:10.916
My father.

42:13.666 --> 42:14.833
I'm sorry.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.581
- This is my cousin.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.375
- Ciao. Emma.
- Francesco.

42:36.416 --> 42:36.875
Fuck's sake.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.500
What's strappona?

42:45.333 --> 42:49.998
Strappona is quite a
rude word for these girls.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.708
It's quite a national thing
hunting them.

42:54.625 --> 42:56.333
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:01.291 --> 43:02.664
Does anyone
have a cigarette?

43:02.666 --> 43:04.458
Yeah, sure, of course.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.125
Thank you.

43:50.625 --> 43:52.789
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you very much.

43:52.791 --> 43:55.539
I see you brought
anorexic Jesus with you.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.375
How are you doing, man?
How are you doing?

44:01.500 --> 44:02.458
Thank you.

44:03.750 --> 44:04.666
And here he is.

48:43.583 --> 48:47.125
Do you mind asking my mom if
she needs any help with lunch?

49:26.166 --> 49:26.625
Good morning.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.416
Ciao Emma. Did you sleep well?

49:29.750 --> 49:31.458
Perfectly well, thank you.

49:32.041 --> 49:33.250
It's a beautiful day.

49:34.541 --> 49:36.250
Is there anything
I can help you with?

49:36.541 --> 49:38.081
No thank you.

49:38.083 --> 49:40.333
Are you sure? I won't have
much time for the beach anyway.

49:40.625 --> 49:43.873
Really? In that case
I need some basil.

49:43.875 --> 49:45.708
You know where it
is in the garden.

49:46.125 --> 49:46.583
And milk.

50:54.833 --> 50:55.708
Hello?

51:02.125 --> 51:02.916
Fra?

51:34.708 --> 51:37.250
- Ciao Fra.
- Ciao Emma.

51:40.041 --> 51:40.500
How are you?

51:41.625 --> 51:43.041
I'm good. How are you?

51:44.916 --> 51:46.291
Good. Thank you.

51:47.625 --> 51:49.500
No beach for you this morning?

51:50.125 --> 51:51.625
No. We ran out of milk.

51:53.791 --> 51:56.666
Did you walk from Suvericcio?

51:58.416 --> 52:00.498
Just in case - you know,
there are wild boars.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.456
My mom saw one this morning.

52:02.458 --> 52:03.539
Where?

52:03.541 --> 52:04.873
Here. Just right
down in the woods.

52:04.875 --> 52:06.625
Pretty dangerous this
time of the year.

52:09.291 --> 52:11.125
Did you go for a ride this
morning?

52:11.500 --> 52:14.414
Yeah, big one.
Castiglioncello and back.

52:14.416 --> 52:16.583
That must be like a hundred
kilometers or something.

52:17.791 --> 52:20.041
You know, this show
won't last forever.

52:25.125 --> 52:27.333
Let me get that milk for you.

58:57.083 --> 58:57.541
Cigarettes?

58:58.416 --> 59:00.291
Emma, you have any cigarettes?

59:02.416 --> 59:03.750
Thank you.

59:07.166 --> 59:09.291
- You want one?
- Yes please.

59:10.041 --> 59:12.166
No, no grazie.

59:21.208 --> 59:23.208
Can I use your card?

59:23.750 --> 59:25.248
- You need to buy a pack?
- Yeah.

59:25.250 --> 59:27.458
Alright, let's go together,
I need to buy another one.

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:04.375
What the fuck?

01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.500
I know, it's horrible. Lapo
makes them race sometimes.

01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:13.289
- Ciao.
- Hello.

01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:14.708
- Hello.
- Hey there.

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:16.456
- Hi.
- Hello!

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:18.458
- Luisa. Nice to meet you.
- Luisa, my sister, sorry.

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:23.041
Sorry.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:25.331
Can I have some?

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:26.708
How could I say no, right?

01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:28.500
Finally.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:35.708
How long are you staying Lulu?

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:39.166
Just for
four days unluckily.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:41.873
Just the time to
relax, and then...

01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:43.875
And then
back. Back to work.

01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:47.208
Oh, thanks.

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.914
Well what would you
propose as an alternative?

01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:22.416
There is
no alternative.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.998
So, forgo search and rescue?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.500
Oh, we rescue them,

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.331
then the others get hope.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:31.625
That's warped logic.

01:09:22.082 --> 01:09:24.375
It means I can touch the food
at the top of my stomach.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.375
It's funny.

01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:41.416
That's horrible.

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:44.500
- Come on, that's so funny.
- No, it's not funny.

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.997
You lament that

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.622
your country is crumbling,
how you're being left behind

01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:56.081
how your generation has
been plunged into recession

01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:58.416
but here we pretend
that it's all a myth.

01:09:59.916 --> 01:10:02.414
It's been sanctioned.
You pretend that it's

01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:03.789
genteel and charming,

01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:05.291
well it's not!

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:11.791
Sorry Lapo.

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:19.208
This is Italy's prodigal son.

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.458
No better than the rest of them.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:28.875
A lost prophet sitting
on his hands.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.416
Emma, you're,
you're wonderful.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:54.706
I really want to thank you
for helping my mother.

01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:55.708
For everything.

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:57.375
It's no problem.

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.748
Now that all this
bullshit with Lapo

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.125
is over we can do
whatever we want.

01:11:08.625 --> 01:11:09.791
We can go to Paris.

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:10.916
To London.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.666
Run away from all this.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:15.200
