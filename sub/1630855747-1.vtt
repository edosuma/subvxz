01:01.352 --> 01:03.855
Years passed by…

01:04.647 --> 01:06.775
The young Little Red Riding Hood…

01:07.400 --> 01:11.279
matured into a fine, intelligent woman.

01:13.281 --> 01:16.659
She had high hopes in her heart,

01:17.202 --> 01:19.537
and thus set out on a journey.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.543
ONCE UPON A CRIME

01:33.885 --> 01:35.720
I wonder if the town's nearby.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.848
Ow! Ouch!

01:39.682 --> 01:42.560
Seriously, how many times now?

01:43.561 --> 01:47.565
It's such a beautiful forest,
but it's full of thorns.

01:51.319 --> 01:55.615
Miss, beautiful things
tend to have thorns.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.290
Hey, you in the red!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.711
I'm shocked you could ignore me so easily.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.339
I'm a witch.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.716
A witch.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.802
Be impressed!

02:17.220 --> 02:21.808
What is it? I'm on my way to Spenhagen.

02:25.520 --> 02:30.775
Spenhagen? That's really far.
What a tiring journey you're taking.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.903
Yes, so I'll be going now.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.114
You're quite a shabby girl.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.034
Such a long journey
to be wearing those shabby shoes.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.494
Yes, such a painful journey!

02:42.078 --> 02:46.499
Right, I'll use my magic
to give you beautiful shoes.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.500
No thank you.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.212
Wait just a moment!

02:52.338 --> 02:55.341
Hey, those shoes are bad
that's why you can't run.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.885
You should get new ones.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.094
You're scaring me.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.017
I'll use my magic.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.146
You're really out of breath.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.440
New shoes…

03:10.523 --> 03:12.525
How about it?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.403
I'll give you new shoes.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.362
Huh?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.911
Hey, you're going to die.

03:22.994 --> 03:27.081
This kingdom is all about beauty!

03:27.624 --> 03:32.170
I don't look like any old witch,
I look stylish, don't I?

03:32.670 --> 03:36.174
See?

03:36.257 --> 03:40.178
Huh? Are you saying this staff is shabby?

03:41.429 --> 03:42.931
Call it "antique"!

03:43.640 --> 03:47.101
Children will never understand
why this staff is beautiful.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.437
Is that so?

03:51.147 --> 03:53.107
Forget about me for now.

03:53.191 --> 03:58.404
I will change your shoes
to fit the beauty of this kingdom.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.322
Okay?

03:59.405 --> 04:05.245
I will change this shabby girl
and shabby shoes to be beautiful.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.080
Stop calling me shabby.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.917
VindaVanda…

04:13.086 --> 04:15.672
Vindaly!

04:26.474 --> 04:28.935
It feels slimy.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.194
Geez, so rude.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.612
What kind of a witch are you?

04:39.696 --> 04:43.074
I can do all sorts of magic.

04:43.866 --> 04:47.787
It's just that shoes are…

04:48.288 --> 04:49.789
I'm just not good with them.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.083
Why use magic you're not good at?

04:52.834 --> 04:56.629
Oh, it's a bit dirty there.
Right at the heel.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.382
Whose fault is that?

05:04.887 --> 05:05.722
Wait!

05:05.805 --> 05:07.390
Ow. Ouch!

05:09.851 --> 05:10.685
That hurts.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.104
Oh dear.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.274
Do cheer up, okay?

05:16.357 --> 05:19.027
Those shoes were covered in mud after all.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.146
Oh, my shoes!

06:03.237 --> 06:05.782
Ow, that hurts.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.284
Ow, ouch.

06:17.752 --> 06:18.669
My shoes…

06:26.427 --> 06:27.887
So they were your shoes.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.521
Thanks.

06:52.870 --> 06:56.290
My name's Little Red Riding Hood.
What's your name?

06:58.668 --> 06:59.794
Cinderella.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.638
The pigeon I was taking care of…

07:12.265 --> 07:13.724
passed away.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.479
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:34.370 --> 07:38.499
Hey Cinderella, who's bullying you?

07:38.583 --> 07:39.667
Huh?

07:40.460 --> 07:44.922
I know we just met,
but I'm good at sensing these things.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.384
Is the person who's bullying you
your stepmother

07:49.010 --> 07:51.804
or perhaps your half-sister Anne?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.807
How did you…?

07:56.434 --> 08:00.438
Those old clothes.
They're hand-me-downs, right?

08:01.647 --> 08:03.441
It says "Anne" on the collar.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.237
To write her name
means she's not the only child.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.740
You have another sister.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.997
The fact that your parents
haven't given you any new clothes

08:18.664 --> 08:21.751
and you're not in a situation
where you can complain

08:22.502 --> 08:23.753
means you have a stepmother.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.090
And your name…

08:29.509 --> 08:30.635
My name?

08:31.719 --> 08:34.013
It's Cinderella.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.057
"Cinder" means "ashes."

08:36.682 --> 08:39.060
Your name means "covered in ashes."

08:40.520 --> 08:42.730
To not even hesitate
to say a name like that…

08:43.564 --> 08:46.359
You must have been
constantly bullied by your family.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.364
That's impressive…

08:52.990 --> 08:57.328
But I don't know why these
horrible things are happening to you.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.262
Crying won't solve your problems.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.233
In this kingdom…

09:29.819 --> 09:31.821
beauty is everything.

09:33.573 --> 09:39.745
The castle where the king lives
is the most beautiful in the world.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.040
Ugly things are sins.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.919
Ugly, dirty people are…

09:47.003 --> 09:48.713
Leave. Go home!

09:48.796 --> 09:50.798
…completely invisible to everyone else.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.804
Because I look like this…

10:00.516 --> 10:02.268
Cinderella.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.687
Yes, Mother.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.607
The teacups are empty.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.443
-Hurry up and make some tea.
-Right away.

10:10.526 --> 10:15.406
My goodness, not only are you ugly,
you're a slowpoke.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.491
I'm sorry.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.369
Hey, hurry up and bring me my mirror.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.662
Right away.

10:21.746 --> 10:26.375
Cinderella, go pick some more raspberries.
We're running out of jam.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.838
Um, Margot, I…

10:31.839 --> 10:33.758
Huh? What?

10:34.717 --> 10:35.551
Huh?

10:35.635 --> 10:41.432
Huh? You don't actually think
you're going to the ball, right?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
Um…

10:47.188 --> 10:49.690
There's no way you could go.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.819
Listen, Cinderella.

10:54.403 --> 10:58.866
The ball tonight is for the prince
to choose his wife.

10:58.949 --> 11:04.246
A grand ball for my beautiful daughter
Anne to become the princess.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.707
Oh, Mother.

11:08.459 --> 11:13.339
If the prince knew
I had such a shabby sister,

11:14.548 --> 11:16.717
I could only half charm him.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.261
We can't have that. Not at all.

11:19.845 --> 11:25.976
Then we'll have to get the best stylist
in the world to double that charm.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.021
Thank you, Mother!

11:29.105 --> 11:34.193
Oh, Anne.
I have another trick up my sleeve.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.071
Oh Mother, you're wonderful. What is it?

11:37.696 --> 11:39.532
Oh no, I dropped it.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.494
Hey, that's mine!

11:44.078 --> 11:47.331
It's here again. What a filthy thing.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.626
Cinderella's friends are so gluttonous.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.753
What a despicable pigeon.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.923
Dirty things
should not exist in this kingdom.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.137
Wait!

12:06.684 --> 12:10.396
So the pigeon you were taking care of
was killed because of that?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.441
What can I do about it?

12:14.483 --> 12:18.195
I've had back luck since I was born.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.698
I mean…

12:21.949 --> 12:25.202
This pigeon and I…

12:27.079 --> 12:28.998
We're not beautiful.

12:35.963 --> 12:40.342
But even if you go to the ball,
you've never talked to the prince.

12:41.343 --> 12:44.763
You don't even like him.
Do you really want to be his wife?

12:50.060 --> 12:52.855
Yes, if it's him.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.773
Wait, you actually like him?!

12:54.857 --> 12:58.486
I mean, he's a really wonderful person.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.448
Beautiful or not,
he treats everybody fairly.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.993
I've seen him in real life once.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.497
Oh, I couldn't say anything.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.582
I was captivated by him.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.834
-And…!
-You sure talk a lot!

13:13.918 --> 13:17.171
The prince has been studying politics
since he was a child.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.714
He's so nice and cool.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.093
If the prince becomes the king,
this kingdom will get better.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.139
If I could marry such a wonderful prince,

13:28.432 --> 13:31.435
I wouldn't ask for anything else.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.899
Okay then. Let's go to the ball.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.400
That's not possible.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.610
Why not?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.029
I…

13:43.572 --> 13:45.324
These are the only clothes I have.

13:47.243 --> 13:51.830
They won't let me into the castle
dressed like this.

13:53.082 --> 13:57.169
My sister Margot threw my shoes away too.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.132
She threw away your shoes?
That's terrible.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.302
What are those scars?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.597
I got them while picking raspberries.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.807
From the brambles.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.352
It seems you're in trouble.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.271
If that's the case, let me help you.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.189
Oh, the witch is still here.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.941
My name is Barbara!

14:19.775 --> 14:22.194
I can make you beautiful for the ball.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.612
I don't believe you can.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
Don't underestimate me.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.491
I'm good at this.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.077
Vinda Vanda…

14:30.786 --> 14:31.620
Vin…

14:33.372 --> 14:34.665
daly!

14:38.335 --> 14:39.587
What?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.346
Wow!

14:49.430 --> 14:51.098
How about that?

14:51.181 --> 14:53.559
You're like a different person!

14:54.727 --> 14:57.187
I-It's cute!

14:57.688 --> 14:59.899
Hey Barbara, do it to me too.

14:59.982 --> 15:00.900
Huh?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.401
I'm going to the ball too.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.652
Why are you going?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.156
I'm in the middle of a journey
to enrich my life.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.700
I must see all the sights
in these countries.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.704
Oh, you're quite calculating. Sure.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
Vinda Vanda…

15:16.790 --> 15:17.917
Vinda…

15:19.585 --> 15:21.378
ly!

15:27.009 --> 15:30.804
Oh, wow! I'm like a princess!

15:33.307 --> 15:34.141
Huh?

15:36.810 --> 15:38.145
It's slimy!

15:38.646 --> 15:41.273
Hey Barbara. My shoes are all muddy again.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.191
Sorry.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.943
Don't "sorry" me.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.445
I can't go to the ball in these shoes.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.405
How about you?

15:54.161 --> 15:56.789
I didn't have shoes to begin with.

15:56.872 --> 15:57.831
Is that how it works?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.378
Can't you
do something about this, Barbara?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.839
Shoes are a bit hard…

16:08.550 --> 16:11.011
You haven't changed at all,
Auntie Barbara.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.432
Another witch!

16:15.516 --> 16:17.810
Hello there, ladies.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.979
Oh, it's you, Tekla.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.606
Hello.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.108
Um…

16:24.733 --> 16:25.818
It's nice to meet you.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.530
Nice to meet you.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.992
Auntie Barbara, it's been a while.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.454
You're still using that old staff.

16:38.038 --> 16:42.042
With that staff,
all the magic will run out at midnight.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.419
That's so little time!

16:43.502 --> 16:45.629
Magic is supposed to disappear.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.550
You can use my wonderful magic.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.261
It'll last you 24 hours.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.430
What say you?

16:54.930 --> 17:00.185
Shall I change your shoes
into beautiful glass slippers?

17:00.894 --> 17:02.938
That sounds wonderful! Can you?

17:03.897 --> 17:04.982
Of course.

17:05.733 --> 17:10.154
I recently learned how to transform
objects into glass with magic.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.490
Yes, please do so!

17:15.451 --> 17:16.285
Ah!

17:18.078 --> 17:18.912
Oh.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.712
Oh my. You have no shoes.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.508
I can't change them
if you're not wearing any shoes.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.346
-Hey Barbara.
-Huh?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.932
Lend Cinderella your shoes.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.684
-Why me?
-Just do it.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.478
Don't "just do it" me.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.438
-Come on.
-No.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.316
-Lend them.
-No.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.525
-Come on.
-Can't.

17:57.785 --> 18:01.747
Wow, they're beautiful. You're amazing.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.751
Listen. The magic only lasts 24 hours.

18:06.502 --> 18:10.798
It only fits the person who first wore it.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.343
Nobody else can wear them.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.178
Don't forget that.

18:17.137 --> 18:17.971
Of course.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.516
Huh?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.226
What is that? Are you hungry?

18:22.309 --> 18:23.644
They're not for eating!

18:23.727 --> 18:27.022
It'd be unsightly
to walk to the castle, right?

18:33.403 --> 18:37.366
Vinda Vanda Vindaly!

18:46.625 --> 18:51.296
Nice to meet you, ladies.
My name is Paul, the mouse.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.090
I know everything about the castle.

18:53.173 --> 18:57.970
I know everything about it.
The wine cellar and the cheese.

18:58.053 --> 19:01.849
We don't know anything about the castle.
Thank you for your help.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.975
Squeak.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.769
Is that pumpkin…
going to turn into a carriage?

19:05.853 --> 19:06.895
Squeak?

19:08.856 --> 19:13.110
Then I'll drive it
and escort you ladies to the castle!

19:13.193 --> 19:15.404
-Wonderful.
-Wow.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.656
You're a mouse,
but you can drive a carriage?

19:17.739 --> 19:18.699
You have a license?

19:18.782 --> 19:22.035
No, no, no.
There are no licenses in this era.

19:22.119 --> 19:22.953
It'll be fine.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.165
Magic will make everything all right!

19:26.915 --> 19:31.253
Vinda Vanda Vindaly!

20:13.295 --> 20:15.005
I can't breathe through my nose!

20:21.970 --> 20:25.641
I never thought
I'd ever be able to go to the ball.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.978
Little Red Riding Hood, thank you so much.

20:30.687 --> 20:35.025
Don't worry about it.
I wanted to go to the ball too.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.195
Is that a bell?

20:38.987 --> 20:39.821
Yeah.

20:39.905 --> 20:44.451
That's the bell from the clock tower.
It tells us the time every hour.

20:46.411 --> 20:50.290
When I first met Barbara,
it did chime four times.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.461
Yes, it just chimed six times
so that means it's six o'clock.

20:55.921 --> 21:00.092
Which means we have six hours
until the magic disappears.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.302
Watch out!

21:14.940 --> 21:15.857
What happened?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.859
He just jumped out of nowhere!

21:28.662 --> 21:29.913
We hit someone.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.794
Calm down. Let me borrow this.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.633
No way…

21:42.551 --> 21:43.593
Do you know him?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.012
Yeah…

21:45.721 --> 21:48.223
He's a stylist named Hans.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.810
He's the number one stylist
working for the royal family.

21:52.352 --> 21:56.231
If he cuts your hair,
you'll look so beautifully different.

21:57.566 --> 22:01.903
Right. His hair looks… charismatic.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.124
He's dead.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.169
What are we going to do?

22:17.252 --> 22:20.088
We have to contact the castle's soldiers.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.049
You're right.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.384
It's my fault.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.262
It's because I wanted to go to the ball.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.555
It's not your fault.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.808
She's right, I'm the one who hit him.
It's my responsibility.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.727
Right…

22:33.810 --> 22:36.605
I guess driving a carriage
is too hard for a mouse.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.442
Yeah, that's why I'll turn myself in.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.779
I'll turn myself in.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.405
No, don't worry about it.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.201
I'll go back to being a mouse
after midnight anyway.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.994
-Why are you acting cool?
-Squeak.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.289
We can't get to the ball
without the carriage.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.457
But…

22:59.419 --> 23:00.337
What's the matter?

23:09.137 --> 23:10.180
Little Red Riding Hood…?

23:13.475 --> 23:14.351
Take a look at this.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.228
-Squeak?
-What is it?

23:16.311 --> 23:19.523
Why is there so much dirt on his heels?

23:19.606 --> 23:22.442
I have no idea, after all, I'm a mouse.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.069
-Don't be cheeky.
-Squeak.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.989
There's only one reason
why there's this much dirt.

23:28.073 --> 23:28.907
Squeak?

23:30.367 --> 23:35.622
It's because somebody dragged him
along the ground.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.541
W-What do you mean by that?

23:37.624 --> 23:41.461
He didn't die because we hit him.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.547
He was already dead.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.843
What should we do, Cinderella?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.638
We can report this and tell the truth.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.099
But if we do…

23:55.267 --> 23:58.228
There'll be an investigation
and we can't go to the ball.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.817
You haven't done anything wrong,

24:03.900 --> 24:06.987
so I don't think it's fair
that you would miss the ball.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.199
But what should we do?

24:19.291 --> 24:22.711
Okay then. This is good.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.214
You have a very
evil-looking face right now.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.303
I've pulled off the perfect crime.

24:31.386 --> 24:32.721
-What is this bit?
-Squeak.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.890
-As if I have any other choice.
-Squeak.

24:35.557 --> 24:39.561
But who killed him?

24:41.104 --> 24:42.230
No idea.

24:43.481 --> 24:48.904
Nobody knew we'd be passing through here.
I bet they were waiting for just anyone.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.906
That's horrible…

24:52.490 --> 24:56.453
But regardless,
it's not your fault that he's dead.

24:57.412 --> 25:01.249
And our carriage
will disappear at midnight.

25:02.125 --> 25:06.379
Which means there will be nothing
tying us to this dead body.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.762
Paul…

25:14.387 --> 25:15.305
I have a favor to ask.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.140
Squeak.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.817
Okay, we're here.

25:31.863 --> 25:32.948
Thank you.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.538
No! We can't let someone ugly like you in.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.456
Go home!

25:43.333 --> 25:44.251
Good evening.

25:46.461 --> 25:50.465
You're so beautiful.
Welcome! Please come in.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.142
I told you no!

26:01.726 --> 26:04.521
You're ugly, so get lost! Now!

26:23.123 --> 26:24.708
Wow.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.388
-Little Red Riding Hood.
-Yeah?

27:20.472 --> 27:23.892
Do I look strange?
I feel like people are staring at me.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.353
-Of course.
-Huh?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.064
They're curious because you're beautiful.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.566
I'm not that…

27:35.403 --> 27:36.529
Cinderella?

27:37.030 --> 27:39.157
It's my stepmother and my sister Anne.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.997
That's them?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.044
Mother, where's Margot?

27:53.963 --> 27:55.048
She's not here.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.842
She was so excited,
she left home before us.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.429
She's probably walking around eating.

28:02.764 --> 28:06.101
Mother, is my hair fine?

28:06.184 --> 28:07.977
Anne!

28:08.770 --> 28:12.315
Hans is the one who styled it.
Of course it's beautiful.

28:12.399 --> 28:16.820
Besides, to learn the prince likes
women with short hair…

28:18.029 --> 28:22.158
As expected of a royal appointee.
Only Hans would have known that!

28:25.120 --> 28:26.871
I'm glad I made you do it.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.332
You're right.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.169
It's nothing. I'm just not used to it.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.590
So how did that thing go?

28:41.803 --> 28:42.887
I can't hear you.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.181
The music's quite loud.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.268
What am I going to do if they find me?

28:48.351 --> 28:51.855
You'll be fine.
You're a different person from before.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.982
-They're not going to notice.
-Really?

28:54.065 --> 28:54.941
Yeah.

29:10.999 --> 29:15.545
Kingdom of Clair de Lune, King Bovell.

29:21.468 --> 29:26.264
Kingdom of Clair de Lune, Prince Gilbert.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.896
He's pulling off a red jacket
paired with white pants.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.815
That's the prince.
He looks good in anything.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.401
Most people would look like
a manzai performer.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.404
Not the prince. Definitely not him.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.864
Everyone.

29:44.282 --> 29:48.244
Welcome to our ball
in this beautiful castle.

29:49.537 --> 29:56.044
Tonight's ball is
for the prince to find a wife.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.797
Beautiful ladies of the kingdom.

29:59.839 --> 30:05.345
If he invites you, do not shy away.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.930
Dance with him.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.899
Well then, Prince. Choose your lady.

30:20.777 --> 30:23.071
-Father, I…
-Choose.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.783
Do not concern yourself
with that woman who has disappeared.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.286
Yes, Father.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.960
Mother, will I be okay?

30:37.043 --> 30:39.587
You'll be fine. Have some confidence.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.131
I'm so nervous.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.019
My prince.

30:59.023 --> 30:59.983
Huh?

31:15.164 --> 31:16.833
Will you dance with me?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.090
I'd love to.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.845
Woo-hoo!

32:56.349 --> 32:57.183
Thank you.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.019
Yes? For what?

33:00.937 --> 33:03.356
You're very beautiful.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.527
Oh no, I'm not.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.907
I suppose it's time I moved on.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.509
Huh?

33:37.223 --> 33:38.474
Glass slippers?

33:39.434 --> 33:41.185
Miss Tekla's been practicing.

33:41.811 --> 33:45.398
My king!

33:45.481 --> 33:47.400
What is it? You're disrupting the ball.

33:47.483 --> 33:48.693
I'm sorry to report…

33:50.403 --> 33:51.279
Excuse me.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.490
That's horrible!

33:55.533 --> 33:56.367
Everyone.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.953
I am canceling this ball.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.666
In the forest just now,

34:04.667 --> 34:05.918
we found one of our subjects.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.921
Our stylist, Hans, is dead.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.803
The body was covered in dirt.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.390
It's evident that somebody has tried
to cover up the body.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.602
There is a horse hoof print
on his forehead.

34:22.685 --> 34:26.522
There are marks on the back of his head
that show he was hit by something.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.233
He was hit by a carriage
coming to this ball

34:29.734 --> 34:33.362
and lost his life when he hit his head
on a rock on the ground.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.530
This means…

34:34.614 --> 34:37.492
the despicable criminal is in this room!

34:39.077 --> 34:43.706
Hans was our national treasure.
The best at making people beautiful.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.667
This crime is absolutely unforgivable!

34:46.751 --> 34:48.795
We begin investigations immediately.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.965
All carriages that have come here tonight
will be investigated.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.219
The owner of a blood-stained carriage

34:56.302 --> 34:58.387
has killed Hans!

35:02.809 --> 35:05.478
You may not leave the castle
until we find the criminal.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.981
Search the carriages immediately.

35:09.065 --> 35:09.941
Of course.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.289
What are we going to do?
We're going to get caught.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.209
Don't worry.
Paul will take care of the carriage.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.293
What?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.462
What? Paul?

35:37.009 --> 35:38.845
Is there something wrong?

35:38.928 --> 35:41.305
What about the thing I asked you to do?

35:41.389 --> 35:43.391
What? Oh, the blood on the carriage?

35:43.474 --> 35:45.059
Yes, I washed it off completely.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.310
What?

35:46.394 --> 35:49.981
Of course, no soldiers
or castle staff saw me.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.774
I may be a mouse but I like to be clean.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.819
What a wonderful mouse you are.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.571
Good job.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.114
But how did you get here?

35:59.031 --> 36:00.116
To tell you the truth…

36:00.199 --> 36:03.202
there's an underground shortcut
that only mice know.

36:04.328 --> 36:08.207
The cheese and wine
in this castle are amazing.

36:08.291 --> 36:13.337
We go back and forth using that shortcut
to sneakily enjoy the cheese and wine.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.090
The cheese and wine are just so good.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.927
Cheese and wine.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.220
Cheese… No!

36:21.304 --> 36:23.181
I haven't drunk the wine.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.100
I am driving the carriage
and I already hit somebody,

36:26.184 --> 36:27.018
I shouldn't drink--

36:27.101 --> 36:29.770
-Sh…
-Squeak?

36:29.854 --> 36:31.397
Shqueak…

36:31.480 --> 36:32.315
-Sh!
-Squeak.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.150
Don't say you hit somebody.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.110
-Huh?
-Everyone's so tense now.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.827
Thank goodness nobody heard me.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.413
I'll just stick with the cheese for today.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.795
My king, there were pieces of cheese
on the ground near Hans' body.

36:55.546 --> 36:59.133
The culprit killed him
while eating cheese…

36:59.217 --> 37:03.262
The culprit…
loves cheese more than anything else.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.725
Find the cheese lovers in this kingdom.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.393
Yes, sir.

37:13.522 --> 37:18.069
It wasn't me! I got this cheese here.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.990
Little Red Riding Hood,
let's use the shortcut and leave.

37:23.783 --> 37:27.954
If we leave now, that's like saying,
"Please suspect us!"

37:28.955 --> 37:30.873
What if they catch and imprison us?

37:30.957 --> 37:32.333
You're right.

37:32.416 --> 37:35.878
I'll head to the carriage
via the shortcut now.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.133
Hey, no wine!

37:48.933 --> 37:52.478
It's a strange-looking carriage
but there's no blood.

38:10.079 --> 38:13.582
It's eleven o'clock.
One hour until the magic disappears.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.377
At this rate,
the magic will disappear here.

38:17.086 --> 38:20.298
Let's hold out until the end
and escape via the shortcut.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.012
Allow me to report my findings.

38:26.595 --> 38:30.725
We searched all carriages,
but found no traces of blood.

38:32.935 --> 38:36.272
That means nobody here did it.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.233
No…

38:39.900 --> 38:43.321
The doctor who performed the autopsy
on Hans contacted me.

38:43.404 --> 38:48.993
Judging from the way the blood clotted,
the back of his head was hit first.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.411
Which means…

38:50.911 --> 38:54.957
Hans was already dead
before he was hit by the carriage.

39:04.133 --> 39:04.967
Hey!

39:08.429 --> 39:10.639
The soldiers searching Hans' house…

39:12.433 --> 39:14.810
found a sharpening stone with blood on it.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.272
There's no doubt
that he was killed in his home.

39:19.440 --> 39:24.236
We estimate he died
sometime between 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. today.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.158
He was hit by the carriage because…

39:29.241 --> 39:33.537
The culprit wanted to sidetrack
the investigation by creating a diversion.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.207
Just as I deduced.

39:36.791 --> 39:37.750
Yeah…

39:37.833 --> 39:41.087
The soldiers searching Hans' house
also found something strange.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.296
Something strange?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.381
Bring it here.

39:43.881 --> 39:44.882
Yes, sir!

39:58.145 --> 39:59.105
Hair…?

39:59.688 --> 40:02.817
Huh? Is there a bunch of hair
in that bag then?

40:03.401 --> 40:04.902
There's a lot of hair in here.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.947
This is just a part of the collection
found at his house.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.536
My king, will you listen
to my theory about this?

40:14.286 --> 40:15.663
-Tell me.
-Yes, sir.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.418
The despicable criminal is in this room!

40:20.501 --> 40:22.211
I just said that, didn't I?

40:22.711 --> 40:24.505
I just said that…

40:24.588 --> 40:27.049
That ribbon belongs to my sister Anne.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.260
That means the hair…

40:30.136 --> 40:33.973
My sister was really proud
of her long, beautiful hair.

40:34.557 --> 40:38.644
Why was this beautiful hair cut off?

40:38.727 --> 40:42.898
This means our number one stylist Hans
was just a human himself.

40:42.982 --> 40:46.110
It means Hans sometimes made mistakes!

40:48.863 --> 40:53.409
Hans accidentally cut this off
when he was working.

40:53.492 --> 40:54.869
Which means…

40:54.952 --> 40:58.664
the girl
whose hair was mistakenly cut off…

40:59.331 --> 41:01.834
holds an extreme grudge against Hans.

41:03.919 --> 41:06.839
So you're saying that
a woman with short hair

41:07.590 --> 41:09.341
is the one who killed Hans.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.469
Exactly!

41:31.989 --> 41:32.948
Five women.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.701
Let me ask you then.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.621
Are these yours?

41:41.415 --> 41:42.625
This is strange.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.045
-Huh?
-Then it's just as I suspected.

41:46.128 --> 41:49.298
Hans accidentally cut your hair.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.216
Well…

41:50.883 --> 41:52.551
Who killed him?

41:53.552 --> 41:55.262
Well…

41:55.846 --> 41:57.640
It's one of these five women.

42:00.142 --> 42:02.019
May I say something?

42:03.479 --> 42:04.480
Yes?

42:04.563 --> 42:06.023
I've never seen you around.

42:06.106 --> 42:08.359
My name is Little Red Riding Hood.

42:09.109 --> 42:11.153
I'm just a traveler.

42:11.237 --> 42:14.323
So you're just a traveler.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.574
What do you need to say?

42:16.575 --> 42:18.327
This is hard for me to say…

42:19.078 --> 42:21.288
The grand chamberlain's
theory is incorrect.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.873
What?

42:23.499 --> 42:25.209
That's rude! You're just a traveler!

42:25.292 --> 42:26.877
Calm down.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.673
Why is he wrong?
It seems like a logical conclusion.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.093
It's very simple.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.096
There's something with these hairs.

42:37.179 --> 42:38.055
Huh?

42:39.098 --> 42:42.101
These hairs have
beautiful ribbons attached to them.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.687
What about that?

42:45.271 --> 42:49.733
Normally, you would take off the ribbon
before you cut the hair.

42:53.320 --> 42:56.949
These weren't accidentally cut off.

42:57.491 --> 42:59.868
They were cut like this on purpose.

43:00.452 --> 43:01.287
True.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.622
Why was he killed then?

43:04.206 --> 43:05.666
No idea.

43:05.749 --> 43:08.502
Only the people
who had their hair cut would know.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.463
How did he cut your hair?

43:12.089 --> 43:14.300
Please tell me, Anne.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.017
Around 10 a.m. today…

43:23.726 --> 43:27.396
I went to get my hair cut at Hans' place.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.317
I never thought the royal stylist
would ever touch my hair.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.277
It was like a dream come true.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.362
I was really looking forward to it.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.452
That's right…

43:42.745 --> 43:48.083
The prince prefers
women with shorter hair.

43:49.376 --> 43:53.297
I'll turn you into a woman he'd like.

44:00.429 --> 44:01.263
And, well…

44:02.931 --> 44:06.935
I know that my mother did
everything she could for the opportunity.

44:07.603 --> 44:11.940
And I'm sure it cost a lot of money.

44:12.024 --> 44:13.108
But…

44:13.734 --> 44:18.030
I didn't want to cut my long hair.

44:18.113 --> 44:19.990
Do you want to become his wife?

44:20.074 --> 44:23.202
Or do you want to have
long, beautiful hair?

44:23.285 --> 44:27.247
God won't let you have both.

44:27.748 --> 44:32.544
His demeanor completely changed
and he forcefully cut my hair!

44:34.880 --> 44:37.841
Oh my…

44:38.425 --> 44:41.011
My poor Anne.

44:42.304 --> 44:46.642
You truly prefer
women with shorter hair, right?

44:48.727 --> 44:51.271
My daughter had long, beautiful hair.

44:51.355 --> 44:54.233
The only person
who can comfort my daughter

44:54.316 --> 44:55.859
is you, my prince.

44:56.777 --> 45:00.864
My daughter would do anything for you.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.324
My prince.

45:02.408 --> 45:06.203
Please choose my daughter Anne
to be your princess.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.914
Anne's the best for you.

45:10.082 --> 45:15.879
I also cut my hair because
Hans told me you preferred it.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.965
You prefer women
with shorter hair, correct?

45:18.048 --> 45:19.299
Take a look at me please.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.343
What? I look better with short hair.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.011
Anne looks the best with it.

45:23.095 --> 45:24.263
Quiet, old woman.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.850
You like young women
with short hair, right?

45:27.933 --> 45:29.977
You young girls need to shut up.

45:30.811 --> 45:35.107
There's no woman here that looks as good
with a short haircut

45:35.190 --> 45:36.567
as my daughter.

45:36.650 --> 45:39.486
We do, what are you talking about?

45:39.570 --> 45:42.614
But does the prince…

45:43.157 --> 45:44.992
truly prefer shorter hair on women?

45:45.742 --> 45:46.702
I didn't know that.

45:50.372 --> 45:51.373
Father…

45:53.876 --> 45:58.005
I actually heard bad rumors
about Hans before.

45:58.088 --> 46:01.758
You completely ignored the question!

46:02.593 --> 46:04.052
Bad rumors?

46:04.636 --> 46:07.556
Hans was indeed a talented stylist.

46:07.639 --> 46:13.270
But he felt envy when he saw women with
beautiful hair who were not his customers…

46:14.104 --> 46:15.481
Why did he feel this way?

46:16.440 --> 46:19.651
He could not stand the existence
of such beautiful hair

46:20.235 --> 46:23.447
that he himself did not style.

46:25.115 --> 46:28.702
So he looked for women
with beautiful hair.

46:29.244 --> 46:31.163
And that beautiful hair…

46:31.955 --> 46:33.582
he forcefully cut it.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.710
That's horrible.

46:37.836 --> 46:39.213
Which means…

46:40.797 --> 46:42.925
What does this mean,
Master Little Red Riding Hood?

46:45.219 --> 46:48.680
I heard something…

46:48.764 --> 46:49.681
What?

46:51.391 --> 46:56.438
The truth is,
my mother's cousin works here as a maid.

46:57.231 --> 47:00.692
She let us into the castle
quietly after noon.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.196
You snuck yourself in.
What were you scheming?

47:04.905 --> 47:06.281
I wasn't scheming anything!

47:06.365 --> 47:11.245
I just wanted to meet the prince
and ask him to invite me to dance.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.416
Did you end up meeting her?

47:18.043 --> 47:19.127
No.

47:19.211 --> 47:22.005
This is my first time seeing her.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.883
What is the meaning of this?

47:25.634 --> 47:28.303
I did go right in front of
the prince's room.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.222
But…

47:31.515 --> 47:34.309
I wasn't able to meet him.

47:35.018 --> 47:35.852
Why not?

47:37.312 --> 47:40.566
Because I…

47:42.192 --> 47:43.819
heard something.

47:56.540 --> 47:58.166
Excuse me.

47:58.250 --> 48:03.255
-That's unforgivable!
-Please calm down, my prince.

48:03.338 --> 48:06.550
Do you know what you've done?

48:17.603 --> 48:19.146
Oh my…

48:20.981 --> 48:24.109
They were arguing.

48:24.985 --> 48:25.819
The prince…

48:26.778 --> 48:29.448
was particularly angry.

48:32.784 --> 48:35.704
Is Anne's story true?

48:39.666 --> 48:40.500
It is.

48:42.419 --> 48:48.592
What's going on here?
My mind is all scram… scrambled.

48:50.719 --> 48:55.307
Hans came to my room
a little past noon today.

48:58.685 --> 49:00.395
Are those new clothes?

49:00.979 --> 49:02.522
It'll look good on you.

49:03.148 --> 49:05.275
Oh my, please excuse my clumsiness.

49:13.909 --> 49:14.743
Hans…

49:15.661 --> 49:17.954
Where did you get this?

49:20.123 --> 49:22.542
That doesn't concern you.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.337
So the rumors are true.

49:26.463 --> 49:32.427
-That's unforgivable!
-Please calm down, my prince.

49:32.511 --> 49:36.098
Do you know what you've done?

49:40.977 --> 49:44.106
What about you?

49:44.731 --> 49:45.732
What?

49:45.816 --> 49:48.819
Everybody has secrets.

49:48.902 --> 49:54.157
I saw you.
I believe it's been a year since then.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.960
Are you saying he threatened you?

50:07.587 --> 50:08.422
Yes.

50:15.595 --> 50:16.722
I'm sorry.

50:19.224 --> 50:20.350
A year ago…

50:21.268 --> 50:23.520
The one who threw away
your precious crown…

50:26.273 --> 50:27.399
was me.

50:36.324 --> 50:38.744
I can't believe you threw away my crown.

50:40.662 --> 50:42.831
That is a serious crime.

50:44.291 --> 50:45.125
Yes.

50:47.627 --> 50:49.004
My son.

50:49.629 --> 50:51.673
Why did you do such a thing?

50:55.594 --> 50:56.428
No.

50:58.513 --> 50:59.347
Yes.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.266
It's as you suspect.

51:02.976 --> 51:06.730
Didn't I tell you
to forget about that maid?

51:06.813 --> 51:08.940
I said I would find you a better woman.

51:09.024 --> 51:12.152
We're having this ball to find her!

51:12.819 --> 51:15.614
Father, I was angry.

51:16.364 --> 51:20.660
You didn't accept me and Remi.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.133
Remi…

51:46.228 --> 51:47.062
I can't…

51:48.772 --> 51:52.651
I'm not beautiful enough for you.

51:55.111 --> 51:56.822
You don't need to worry, Remi.

51:57.447 --> 52:00.659
I'll convince my father.

52:02.494 --> 52:03.620
My prince…

52:07.332 --> 52:08.250
Remi…

52:14.631 --> 52:17.843
You are the most…

52:20.262 --> 52:21.638
beautiful to me.

52:25.433 --> 52:26.726
But…

52:27.477 --> 52:29.646
after I talked to my father,

52:30.480 --> 52:32.023
she disappeared.

52:33.984 --> 52:37.153
You didn't accept her and she disappeared!

52:37.237 --> 52:38.864
I told you that was a misunderstanding!

52:43.201 --> 52:45.203
I did not oppose your relationship!

52:46.079 --> 52:49.040
That maid disappeared all on her own!

52:56.172 --> 52:58.967
You don't understand my feelings!

52:59.676 --> 53:00.635
You don't know…

53:01.177 --> 53:03.096
how much I love her!

53:05.682 --> 53:06.892
Um…

53:08.685 --> 53:09.686
May I say something?

53:09.769 --> 53:11.396
You picked quite a moment to interrupt.

53:12.355 --> 53:13.523
What great timing.

53:14.232 --> 53:15.859
I'm almost impressed.

53:15.942 --> 53:17.736
You tiptoed into that like an elephant.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.864
I'd like to move on now.

53:21.489 --> 53:22.741
Is that okay, my prince?

53:26.328 --> 53:29.122
So did Hans just leave you?

53:34.294 --> 53:39.674
Until the new crown was made,
I had a hard time styling the king's hair.

53:39.758 --> 53:44.554
I wondered how I would present
a dignified king without his crown.

53:46.556 --> 53:50.352
Well, it wasn't too difficult
for someone like me.

54:00.153 --> 54:02.072
I've always thought

54:02.948 --> 54:06.201
that your hand mirror was beautiful.

54:07.827 --> 54:10.121
Please send it to my house.

54:10.205 --> 54:12.332
It'll be a gift from you.

54:12.415 --> 54:13.458
Let's see what time…

54:14.042 --> 54:17.128
Five o'clock in the afternoon
should be fine.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.383
He blackmailed me.

54:23.718 --> 54:25.679
He demanded the royal hand mirror.

54:27.931 --> 54:32.477
Don't tell me you gave him the mirror
has been in our family for generations.

54:38.733 --> 54:40.819
Excuse me, my prince.

54:40.902 --> 54:43.780
I'm here to collect the item
to be sent to Hans' house.

54:56.835 --> 55:00.130
I decided to not give him the mirror.

55:03.216 --> 55:06.052
I realized something
looking in that mirror.

55:07.929 --> 55:09.889
Even though I knew the rumors about him,

55:11.224 --> 55:12.726
I'd just be used by him.

55:13.435 --> 55:15.770
I was ugly for
not being able to say anything.

55:17.397 --> 55:18.231
Prince…

55:19.357 --> 55:22.569
In order to shut him up about the crown,

55:23.319 --> 55:25.071
you killed him, didn't you?

55:26.406 --> 55:27.866
That's not true.

55:28.950 --> 55:31.077
Father, please believe me.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.038
After this ball was over,

55:33.121 --> 55:36.082
I decided I was going to tell you
about the crown.

55:37.709 --> 55:39.127
I hate to tell you, my prince.

55:40.128 --> 55:43.423
That's something nobody can prove.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.217
No, I didn't kill him.

55:46.301 --> 55:47.469
Then why?

55:49.554 --> 55:52.265
Why didn't you come to dance practice?

55:53.266 --> 55:55.435
I went to go check on you.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.562
You weren't in your room.

55:58.104 --> 55:59.606
You weren't in the castle.

56:02.358 --> 56:03.443
I…

56:05.028 --> 56:06.571
wanted to be by myself.

56:07.197 --> 56:08.907
So I just went out for a walk.

56:09.991 --> 56:12.744
That's too convenient of an excuse!

56:14.204 --> 56:17.332
What time did you go for a walk?

56:19.501 --> 56:20.919
From 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.839
Master Little Red Riding Hood,

56:24.923 --> 56:27.258
that's the time the doctor said
Hans was killed!

56:27.342 --> 56:29.135
That's a coincidence.

56:30.678 --> 56:33.056
Did you meet anybody
while you were walking?

56:33.890 --> 56:35.308
No, nobody.

56:35.934 --> 56:38.269
Not many people wander the hill I go to.

56:40.563 --> 56:41.397
The prince…

56:42.482 --> 56:44.150
has a motive to kill Hans.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.402
And he has no alibi.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.408
My prince.

56:53.034 --> 56:56.788
You've always had
a strong sense of justice.

56:58.957 --> 57:02.043
Is that sense of justice this time

57:03.044 --> 57:04.796
showing its hidden face?

57:07.257 --> 57:08.633
Father…

57:10.301 --> 57:14.097
Are you suspecting me of murder?

57:15.348 --> 57:18.643
No, I did not kill him!

57:22.439 --> 57:24.065
Arrest the prince.

57:24.649 --> 57:25.817
Father!

57:40.165 --> 57:41.416
Take him away.

57:45.086 --> 57:46.337
My prince!

57:46.421 --> 57:50.300
I believe you. You didn't kill Hans!

57:54.471 --> 57:55.513
Thank you.

57:56.639 --> 57:57.474
My prince…

58:08.026 --> 58:11.362
Little Red Riding Hood,
there's no way he could have killed Hans.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.697
Please do something.

58:12.780 --> 58:15.533
But there is circumstantial evidence…

58:20.163 --> 58:21.039
Huh?

58:26.628 --> 58:27.670
This is…

58:28.213 --> 58:29.339
A thorn.

58:35.929 --> 58:38.014
The prince could not have been the killer.

58:38.097 --> 58:38.932
Hey!

58:39.015 --> 58:40.725
Outsiders are not allowed in here!

58:40.808 --> 58:42.101
You must leave!

58:43.311 --> 58:44.187
Please wait!

58:59.077 --> 59:02.705
You just said, "The prince
could not have been the killer," right?

59:03.581 --> 59:04.415
Yes.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.709
Why do you think so?

59:08.127 --> 59:12.215
From 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.,
the prince was by himself.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.926
He was sitting on a hill with a nice view.

59:16.886 --> 59:17.971
What did you just say?

59:18.972 --> 59:21.933
I've been sleeping
in a cave in the forest.

59:22.600 --> 59:25.103
From there, I saw him the whole time.

59:25.812 --> 59:26.688
Is that true?

59:27.522 --> 59:28.356
Yes.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.568
A red jacket with white pants.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.903
I saw them in the green hills.

59:36.114 --> 59:40.994
If what you're saying is true,
this means the prince has an alibi!

59:41.077 --> 59:43.037
The tables have turned!

59:44.789 --> 59:46.833
The king is his father after all.

59:47.625 --> 59:48.793
I'm so relieved.

59:48.876 --> 59:49.752
My king!

59:51.879 --> 59:53.131
Please be careful.

59:53.214 --> 59:54.173
About what?

59:54.257 --> 59:58.052
Take a look at this ugly, dirty person.

59:58.136 --> 01:00:01.848
She's a beggar and a lowly person.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:05.518
We cannot trust her.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:14.777
Hey.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:16.237
Yes, sir.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:20.992
This is stupid.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.579
May I say something?

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:32.045
Why don't the people of this kingdom
believe in their own prince?

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:38.718
So you believe
what that woman is saying to be true?

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.261
Yes.

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:42.889
But the way she looks…

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.059
Are you saying
because she's ugly, she's lying?

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:48.478
There's no reasoning behind that.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.273
But she's so vulgar.

01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:56.986
We don't know
if she's lying just for the money.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.822
You're so suspicious of everyone.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:06.162
The prince's outfit was made
for the ball, correct?

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.040
That's correct.

01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:10.792
Then what is this?

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:16.589
This was on the floor
where the prince was arrested.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.675
What is that?

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:20.885
It's a thorn from a bramble.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.972
Around here… Let's see.

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:28.059
Ow! Ouch!

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:29.477
Oh.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:33.773
These grow in the forest on the way
to that hill with a nice view.

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.736
May I elaborate further?

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.490
How could thorns get on clothes that
the prince wore for the first time today?

01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:45.034
There's only one possibility.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.330
The prince did go to that hill today.

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:52.291
Excellent deduction,
Master Little Red Riding Hood!

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.127
Then the prince is telling the truth!

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:56.212
Exactly.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.256
My king.

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:01.509
Bring him back.

01:02:01.592 --> 01:02:02.427
Yes, sir.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.273
What's going on?

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:17.650
My prince.

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:21.863
Somebody here can confirm your alibi.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.365
That is why I'm releasing you.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.497
Everyone.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:35.585
I apologize for keeping you here so late.

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:41.257
You may go now.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.269
Cinderella, we gotta go.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.105
Excuse us.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:57.899
Please wait.

01:02:58.399 --> 01:03:00.943
My prince, please take a look at my Anne.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.738
Look at her beautiful proportions!

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.283
You love short-haired women, right?

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:10.787
I'll do anything for you, my prince.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.748
Peek…

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.502
We're not giving up yet!

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.047
Anne loves you!

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.093
The bell is going to stop ringing!
Hurry up!

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:39.398
-Cinderella, hurry!
-Yeah.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:44.070
Please wait!

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.073
I'm sorry, my prince.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.866
I must go home.

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.077
At least tell me your name.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.370
I'm sorry!

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:53.788
We're taking off now!

01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.883
You can do it! Take us as far as you can!

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:48.885
The next chime is the last one!

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:03.232
To think I finally became a human…

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:23.753
Ow…

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:32.553
The magic…

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:35.139
is over.

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.624
We're here. This is my house.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.335
You can stay here as long as you like.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.380
Thank you. I'd like to go in.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.297
Sure.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.805
-Little Red Riding Hood.
-Yeah?

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:16.722
Here.

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:18.349
Oh.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.523
It stinks!

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:03.185
She went this way! Go after her!

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:52.735
What was that?

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.446
Is someone here?

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:09.376
Ow.

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.006
Who are you?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.466
That's my question.

01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:18.177
My name is Margot.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.262
Mar…

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.849
Are you Cinderella's other sister?

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:26.519
You know her?

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.940
No, enough about that.

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:34.026
Can you please help me?
I'm being chased by the soldiers.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.403
Why? What did you do?

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.950
I…

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.539
accidentally killed Hans the stylist!

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.296
She's still around here. Find her!

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.881
Yes, sir!

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:05.391
This scone goes really well
with raspberry jam.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.060
I'm surprised you can eat
at a time like this.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.481
Hans sent me a letter.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.069
He said he'd cut my hair
specially for the ball.

01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:20.948
And that he'd be waiting
at his house at 4 p.m.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.076
Hans…

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.078
It's me, Margot.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.084
I'm coming in.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.339
Thank you for inviting me.

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:54.064
I was really out of it and when I got up…

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:58.944
What's going on here?

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.530
I got hit in the head one more time. Bam!

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.952
You didn't see who hit you?

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.167
Show me.

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:16.420
Ouch.

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:17.504
Yeah, that's…

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.257
definitely two hits to the head.

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:23.552
When I came to, my head really hurt.

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:32.603
Ow.

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:35.856
And I realized that in front of me was…

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.151
Huh?

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:41.779
I knew it the moment I saw him.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.198
I knew that he was dead.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:48.077
And in my hand was…

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:53.958
Wait a minute.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:58.671
So this means you don't
actually remember killing him.

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.506
Yeah.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:04.343
But no matter how you think about it,
it could have only been me.

01:11:08.138 --> 01:11:09.515
Calm down.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.642
Do you remember anything else?

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.102
Huh?

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:21.735
Oh, right.

01:11:34.748 --> 01:11:38.252
Anne's hair was on the desk.

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:41.755
She was proud of her hair.
There's no way she would have cut it.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.090
And then?

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:47.303
I'd heard a bad rumor before.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:53.934
Hans would cut long, beautiful hair
from young women and collect them.

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.855
I thought someone who was envious
made up the rumor.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:02.067
But it all came to me.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:06.405
Hans forcefully cut Anne's hair.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:11.869
Blood rushed to my head
and I must have killed Hans.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.873
I'm sure that's what happened!

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:18.083
Calm down.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:20.586
And then what happened after that?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.757
I thought I had to cover it up.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.604
I put Hans in a wagon.

01:12:41.732 --> 01:12:43.609
I hid among the trees
at a fork in the road

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.736
and waited for a carriage to pass by.

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:50.199
You wanted a carriage to hit him
and falsify the cause of death?

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:52.326
Yeah.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:56.914
I waited for a bit
and a strange-looking carriage came by.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:16.600
After I heard the horse kick Hans,
I ran into the forest.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:18.894
And then?

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.899
I was originally
supposed to go to the ball.

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:27.152
But I wasn't up for it.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:32.157
I was worried I was going to get caught.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:37.204
I didn't want to go home either,
so I stayed in the forest.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:42.042
And just now,
the soldiers on patrol found me.

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:43.877
Get her!

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.926
No, help me!

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.014
Here's the one you've been looking for.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.724
She confessed to killing Hans.

01:13:57.808 --> 01:13:58.851
Take her away.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:02.312
You're kidding. You told me you'd help me!

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.648
I didn't say such a thing.

01:14:06.733 --> 01:14:09.862
You brute! You demon! You ogre!

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.632
Master Little Red Riding Hood!

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:33.093
I'm glad to meet you again.

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.972
I'm impressed
you got a confession out of her.

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:38.891
Now I can bring the king good news.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:42.227
She's not the killer.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:43.562
What?

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:47.441
She's a bully,
so I just wanted her to feel some pain.

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.862
Grand Chamberlain,
there's something bothering me.

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:54.448
Could you show me Hans' house?

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.868
Certainly.

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:24.603
This… isn't Hans' blood.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.774
The blood on the floor
is about a year old now.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.443
Hans only bled a little.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.654
I can only guess he had a quick death.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.236
I see…

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.447
Grand Chamberlain.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.866
Can you help me with something?

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:23.120
Anything for you,
Master Little Red Riding Hood.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:20.969
My prince.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:25.682
The prince is searching
for the owner of this glass slipper.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:32.522
Strangely, this glass slipper
can only be worn by the owner.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.567
Girl, tell me your name.

01:17:37.402 --> 01:17:39.863
My name is Cinderella.

01:17:39.946 --> 01:17:40.989
Cinderella.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.491
Please try this on.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.494
Yes.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.245
As you wish.

01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:25.492
It fits! It's a perfect fit!

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.621
I see.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:30.664
You're the one.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.214
Arrest her.

01:18:39.756 --> 01:18:40.590
Yes, sir.

01:18:41.174 --> 01:18:42.300
What?

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:44.886
What? Why?

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:52.185
Little Red Riding Hood,
tell them they have the wrong person.

01:18:54.604 --> 01:18:55.647
Cinderella.

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:57.315
Huh?

01:18:57.941 --> 01:19:01.319
Why do your feet have so many scars?

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.449
I told you yesterday.

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.410
I got them picking raspberries
from the brambles.

01:19:08.493 --> 01:19:09.703
Cinderella.

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.038
Why are you barefoot?

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.958
My sister Margot…

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:16.626
Cinderella.

01:19:17.377 --> 01:19:21.423
Why is your crime plan so sloppy?

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:25.927
The person who killed Hans is…

01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:27.512
you.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.685
What are you saying?

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:38.982
Something felt off about you
from the moment we met.

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:42.527
That's why I went to the ball with you.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.154
Huh?

01:19:44.237 --> 01:19:46.114
I first thought something seemed off

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.367
when you said
Margot threw away your shoes.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.912
What about it?

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:56.208
Margot loves raspberry jam, doesn't she?

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:58.794
If she'd thrown your shoes away,

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:02.798
you couldn't have gotten raspberries
from the forest with all those brambles.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.966
They were bullying me!

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.219
Do you want to make me into the murderer?

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.470
What about motive?

01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:11.264
I don't have any reason to kill Hans.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:13.934
Your motive probably was…

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:17.020
because you're beautiful.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.159
Do you want to be beautiful?

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:33.245
Huh?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:37.332
Hans realized your true beauty.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:39.417
Then…

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:43.004
he was seized by his urge
to cut off your hair.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.925
You know about me, don't you?

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.802
Exactly! That's right!

01:20:48.885 --> 01:20:52.556
I'm the world's number one charismatic…

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.974
hair stylist.

01:20:54.599 --> 01:20:56.101
Hans.

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:01.356
I cut the king's hair too.

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:03.733
You've heard of me, right?

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:09.781
Come to my house.

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:12.367
I'll cut your hair.

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:13.827
This is a special opportunity.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.040
You want to be beautiful, don't you?

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.173
I'm sure you were happy.

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:32.637
People call you ugly
and you're constantly bullied.

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:35.891
And yet the kingdom's best stylist
acknowledged you

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.976
and said you could become beautiful.

01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:43.315
But… the reality was different.

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.411
What are you doing?!

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:04.377
Your hair will be beautiful.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:10.842
It's more beautiful than any hair
I've cut in this kingdom.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:14.846
Therefore, it should not exist!

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:24.230
You killed Hans.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:29.861
You then thought to frame
your stupid sister Margot.

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:43.833
I WILL CUT YOUR HAIR FOR THE UPCOMING BALL

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:47.796
You wrote a letter pretending to be Hans
and invited your sister over.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.969
After Margot came to Hans' house,
you knocked her out

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:58.014
so that the prince's servant
would find her there at 5 p.m.

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:00.976
That should have been the end of it.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:02.727
But…

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.772
You made one mistake.

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:08.066
I'm coming in.

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:12.862
Thank you for inviting me.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:43.184
You failed to knock Margot out, but
you no longer had the sharpening stone.

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:44.269
So out of panic…

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.983
The glass slipper's heel broke
from the impact.

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.279
This is that piece of glass.

01:23:55.321 --> 01:23:57.157
It was on Margot's clothing.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:03.455
You weren't able to
find this piece of glass,

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.958
but you had knocked Margot out.

01:24:07.959 --> 01:24:11.546
You just had to wait for
the prince's servant to come at 5 p.m.,

01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:14.799
who would find her there
and assume her to be the culprit.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.261
And you would have
pulled off the perfect crime.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:24.225
But the one thing you couldn't calculate
was the prince's change of heart.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:29.773
The servant didn't come
and Margot wasn't found at the scene.

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:34.986
That's all speculation.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.991
If that really was left by the culprit,
then your story doesn't add up!

01:24:47.874 --> 01:24:48.875
Take a look.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:51.419
My glass slippers are perfectly intact.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:54.172
This proves that I'm not the murderer.

01:24:55.715 --> 01:24:59.385
It's true that this piece of glass
doesn't match with those slippers.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:00.929
Right?

01:25:01.554 --> 01:25:05.058
The glass slippers
only fit the original owner.

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:08.353
That piece of glass
isn't a part of this pair.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:12.524
There are many people who have
glass slippers from Miss Tekla's magic.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.484
Somebody else killed him.

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:17.237
But it can only be you.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.449
Enough! If you're going to insist
it was me, then show me some proof.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:24.202
Cinderella, actually…

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.331
the left slipper you're wearing right now…

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:32.544
And the one you left
in the castle last night…

01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:34.712
They're not the same.

01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:36.631
What?

01:25:36.714 --> 01:25:38.466
That glass slipper…

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:48.476
It was buried
with the pigeon you cared about.

01:25:52.355 --> 01:25:55.191
You had two pairs of glass slippers.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:26:00.738
The left glass slipper you left
at the castle…

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:02.866
is over there.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:11.875
The right slipper that's paired
with the left slipper you're wearing…

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:14.961
It's right here.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:17.172
We found it buried with the same pigeon.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.551
Grand Chamberlain,
what about this piece of glass?

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.687
They fit perfectly together.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.066
When I first met you,
you didn't have any shoes.

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:40.278
It wasn't because Margot
threw your shoes away.

01:26:41.779 --> 01:26:45.116
You hit Margot with the glass slipper
that Miss Tekla changed for you

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:48.620
but the heel broke off and you buried it.

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.875
You met Miss Tekla twice yesterday

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:56.377
and got two pairs of glass slippers.

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.505
The second time was with me.

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:02.926
The first time was after you killed Hans

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.887
and wrote that letter to Margot.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.682
Isn't that right, Miss Tekla?

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:11.559
That's right.

01:27:13.853 --> 01:27:14.812
What a surprise!

01:27:18.691 --> 01:27:21.444
So you're Cinderella.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:28.409
As Little Red Riding Hood said,
I changed her shoes into glass slippers.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.703
Do you remember what time?

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.207
I think it was 3 p.m.

01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:38.461
The castle bell rang three times.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:41.047
You're mistaking me for somebody else.

01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:45.426
When I first met you with Little Red
Riding Hood, you said "Nice to meet you."

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:47.845
If it was the second time,
you would've said something.

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.391
I don't have to
explain this one to you, right?

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:52.892
What?

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.436
Right, Barbara?

01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:57.230
Yeah.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.651
When you two met the second time,
I had already made you so beautiful

01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:04.237
you looked like a different person.

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:08.408
It's not Tekla's fault
she thought you were somebody else.

01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:17.834
Thank you for your testimonies,
Miss Tekla and Barbara.

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:21.838
Why are you so casual with me? W-Why?

01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:24.215
You're welcome.

01:28:24.924 --> 01:28:27.176
Okay, we'll be going now.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.225
Let's move on.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:40.898
You might have refused
to wear this slipper if I asked.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.195
That's why I asked
the prince for his help.

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:50.616
You wouldn't refuse
slippers from the prince.

01:28:51.784 --> 01:28:53.745
There's no way you would.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.459
How do you know?

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.003
Know what?

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:05.256
That the left slipper I'm wearing

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.176
pairs up with the broken right slipper?

01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:11.304
They're both glass slippers,
it's not proof.

01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:14.098
You're trying to set me up
to be the murderer.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:17.185
So you secretly switched them.
That's definitely the case.

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:20.271
Cinderella.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.025
The fact that
those slippers fit you perfectly

01:29:26.569 --> 01:29:28.071
means you're the murderer.

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:56.974
You're right.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:00.978
I…

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:02.980
did it.

01:30:07.151 --> 01:30:08.111
I…

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:11.989
killed Hans.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.457
Tell me, Little Red Riding Hood.

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:27.797
How did you know these slippers
were buried with the pigeon?

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:32.844
People in this kingdom

01:30:33.553 --> 01:30:35.721
only try to see what is beautiful.

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:39.100
Burying it with the pigeon

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:43.688
means nobody will ever go
and dig up a dirty pigeon.

01:30:46.023 --> 01:30:47.150
You…

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:52.238
understand the people of this kingdom
better than anybody else.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:59.704
It was the perfect hiding spot.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.331
At least that's what I thought.

01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:07.879
Yeah…

01:31:08.754 --> 01:31:10.840
it was the perfect hiding spot.

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:19.015
Ow.

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:52.632
I knew it.

01:31:53.549 --> 01:31:55.468
I'm an unlucky girl.

01:31:57.803 --> 01:31:59.472
If I never met you…

01:32:06.145 --> 01:32:07.188
Cinderella.

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:10.775
My prince.

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:16.030
I don't care if it's a lie.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.866
Tell me one last time.

01:32:20.826 --> 01:32:22.995
Please tell me one more time.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:26.207
What is it?

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.211
That I'm…

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.172
very beautiful.

01:32:46.602 --> 01:32:47.770
You're very…

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.233
disappointing.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:18.968
Arrest her.

01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:20.136
Yes, sir.

01:33:34.233 --> 01:33:35.192
My prince.

01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:40.990
Little Red Riding Hood, thank you.

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:44.118
Thanks to you,
we were able to solve the case.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.120
Oh, are you okay with this?

01:33:46.829 --> 01:33:47.663
Huh?

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:52.752
There's one more problem to solve.

01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:55.546
What other problem?

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:59.050
Your future wife, of course.

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:04.305
You chose Cinderella at the ball
but she's been arrested now.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.224
Forget about it.

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:10.686
Even if Cinderella wasn't arrested,

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.814
I wasn't planning on making her my wife.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:17.526
Really? You seemed into her at the ball.

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:21.655
I had to dance with somebody
because my father was there.

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:25.451
What a thoughtless man.

01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:29.205
I feel bad about it.

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:32.583
But there is somebody

01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:35.795
in my heart already.

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:48.974
Yes, about her…

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:52.853
I thought something was strange.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:59.026
Why did Remi disappear a year ago?

01:34:59.985 --> 01:35:02.530
Was it really the king's fault?

01:35:03.989 --> 01:35:05.533
It can only be him.

01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:12.373
I investigated Hans' house
and found old, dried-up blood.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:17.837
What are you trying to say?

01:35:20.923 --> 01:35:23.884
Remi was attacked by Hans.

01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:31.350
I knew it.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.770
That hair belonged to Remi.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:39.817
Hans attacked Remi
and she tried her best to fend him off.

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:02.965
With a big scar on her face,
she disappeared.

01:36:03.799 --> 01:36:04.800
Why?

01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:07.803
Just because of a big scar on her face,

01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:10.014
doesn't mean
she would disappear like that.

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.392
It's the way this kingdom is.

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:19.732
This kingdom places importance on beauty.

01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:24.862
The wife of the prince in such a kingdom
would certainly be judged by her looks.

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:30.326
With a large scar on her face,

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.745
she's no longer considered beautiful.

01:36:34.538 --> 01:36:36.624
That's why she disappeared.

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:41.212
Isn't that right?

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:52.515
Who are you?

01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:02.691
Remi…

01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:08.322
Remi.

01:37:08.405 --> 01:37:11.283
I've been looking for you all this time!

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:13.327
I…

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.957
am no longer worthy of those words.

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:21.961
I'm ugly and have a scar.

01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.630
I'm not appropriate for you.

01:37:24.713 --> 01:37:26.840
-That's not true!
-It is!

01:37:27.633 --> 01:37:32.012
There's a beautiful woman out there
that's worthy of you.

01:37:33.889 --> 01:37:35.307
Just forget…

01:37:36.976 --> 01:37:37.810
about me.

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:40.104
Remi…

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.231
What are you saying?

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.033
Um… may I say something?

01:38:00.749 --> 01:38:05.796
Remi, you were at the hill
on the day of the ball.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.841
Why were you watching the prince
for two hours?

01:38:10.759 --> 01:38:11.802
That's because…

01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:17.349
You still love the prince now.

01:38:18.642 --> 01:38:19.727
Am I right?

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:29.778
That's why you were watching over
the prince even after you disappeared.

01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:37.077
Unnoticed and ignored,
you came into this form.

01:38:43.834 --> 01:38:44.668
Remi.

01:39:00.017 --> 01:39:00.851
Remi.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.773
You're still…

01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:10.611
more beautiful than anyone else.

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:14.156
My prince…

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.980
THANK YOU

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:55.030
Little Red Riding Hood, thank you so much.

01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:58.367
It's my pleasure.

01:39:58.867 --> 01:40:04.039
My prince and Remi,
I'm glad the king approves.

01:40:06.083 --> 01:40:07.543
It's all thanks to you.

01:40:07.626 --> 01:40:10.713
I was able to realize
what was important to me.

01:40:10.796 --> 01:40:11.630
Thank you.

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:15.342
Be happy.

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:18.721
Well, I'll be on my way now.

01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:21.140
And like that,

01:40:21.223 --> 01:40:25.686
Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood's
story came to an end.

01:40:25.769 --> 01:40:28.063
Master Little Red Riding Hood!

01:40:35.571 --> 01:40:41.493
However, this is only one story of many.

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:47.416
That's right.
This story is about love and magic

01:40:47.499 --> 01:40:50.210
where Little Red Riding Hood
risks her life.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.713
Ow! Ouch!

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:55.966
Another thorn?

01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:03.599
I guess beautiful things
have thorns in them.

01:45:17.185 --> 01:45:22.190
