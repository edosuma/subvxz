WEBVTT

00:10.167 --> 00:12.100
- * And the virgin's breast
was exposed to the dress *

00:12.200 --> 00:13.600
both: Boo!
- Ahh!

00:13.700 --> 00:15.600
- What a sensual fall.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.033
- What the hell
are you guys doing?

00:18.133 --> 00:20.033
- Playing Boo.
- I'm winning.

00:20.133 --> 00:21.267
- You guys are
gonna hurt someone.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.667
- Ooh, good idea, Billie.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.000
Extra points
to make someone fall down.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.700
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:27.633 --> 00:28.833
Hey, did you know
that Bigfoot's

00:28.933 --> 00:30.567
an interdimensional
time traveler?

00:30.667 --> 00:32.100
- Get out of my room!
- We'll talk about it later.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.333
- Chet!

00:36.667 --> 00:37.667
- Boo!
- Ah, jeez!

00:37.767 --> 00:39.233
Ah! Oh!

00:42.133 --> 00:43.433
- Boo!
- Ahh! Ahh!

00:45.600 --> 00:46.967
Joy, I need help
out of this.

00:48.467 --> 00:50.167
- I think you're
still winning.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.433
No flipping way.

00:51.533 --> 00:53.367
Give it to me.

00:53.467 --> 00:54.600
- But not for long.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.100
Watch this.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.767
Boo!

01:01.400 --> 01:02.633
- You won.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.633
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:04.733 --> 01:06.300
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:06.400 --> 01:07.900
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:08.067 --> 01:10.567
Ha ha!

01:13.933 --> 01:17.633
- I can't believe you're wearing
that shirt to the funeral.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.300
Can you see my nipples?

01:20.900 --> 01:21.833
She's coming. Cross--
- Stop.

01:21.933 --> 01:23.067
Don't jiggle my tits.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.133
- I'm not jiggling
your tits.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.400
- You jiggled it.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.800
Don't molest me.
- I'm not mo--

01:26.900 --> 01:28.067
Hi, Virginia.
How are you?

01:28.133 --> 01:29.167
I wasn't molesting her.

01:29.267 --> 01:30.500
- Let's make this snappy.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.133
I have to get home
and sign divorce papers

01:32.233 --> 01:35.067
so my husband can start
his new life with my sister.

01:35.167 --> 01:37.067
Come on.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.400
The alarm will be off,

01:38.500 --> 01:40.233
but the GPS
will still be enabled.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.633
- I'm sorry about your sister.

01:42.733 --> 01:44.367
- Thank you.

01:44.467 --> 01:46.533
- Your first soul mate
is your sister.

01:46.633 --> 01:47.900
- Yeah, exactly.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.067
- Must have really, like,

01:49.167 --> 01:50.833
knocked your socks off,
you know.

01:50.933 --> 01:52.333
- I feel shaken.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.067
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry too.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.400
What the hell--what--

01:55.500 --> 01:57.400
What did you say?
- That was hurtful.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.467
- Oh, I was saying I'm sorry,
too, for your sister.

01:59.567 --> 02:01.567
- Ah, ah, no.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.567
That's who you're sorry for
in this scenario.

02:03.667 --> 02:07.400
- I think what this stupid idiot
was trying to say was

02:07.500 --> 02:09.500
you were talking about GPS.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.867
- Thank you.
- Yeah. So...

02:10.967 --> 02:12.267
- If you go off route,

02:12.367 --> 02:13.800
because the GPS
is still enabled,

02:13.900 --> 02:14.967
the police
will be notified.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.367
- Mm-hmm.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.833
- Other than that,
you've got four hours,

02:17.933 --> 02:19.633
which should be ample time
for the service

02:19.733 --> 02:20.800
and the round trip.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.200
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.667
Have a great time
at your friend's funeral.

02:23.767 --> 02:24.700
- Thank you.
- Sure.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.667
- I will.

02:28.467 --> 02:29.933
Last one to the car's a bitch,
'cause it's you.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.267
- Okay.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.433
All right, thank you.

02:32.533 --> 02:33.867
So much for--oops.

02:33.967 --> 02:35.767
That's--never mind that.
I'll get it.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.500
- I'll let you get that, yeah.
- It's an ornate ball.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.667
Um, Virginia, could I--
sorry.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.367
Hi, can I just ask you--

02:40.467 --> 02:42.800
- I'm not gonna
take her for you.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.067
- Okay.
Um...

02:46.133 --> 02:50.100
Can I just tell you,
just between friends, I--

02:51.600 --> 02:53.067
Let's not put a label on it.

02:53.133 --> 02:56.200
- I just--I had a very traumatic
childhood experience

02:56.300 --> 02:57.867
at a funeral,

02:57.967 --> 03:01.267
and I think if I go,
I might have a panic attack.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.400
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.233
- Let me ask you something,
okay, while we're sharing.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.700
- Mm-hmm.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.167
- Have you ever walked
in on your husband

03:08.267 --> 03:11.800
nosediving your sister
in your marital bed?

03:15.667 --> 03:19.267
- No. I had a cat that
moved in with my neighbor--

03:19.367 --> 03:20.800
- Have her back by 6:00.
- Okay.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.800
- Bye.
- Oh, bye.

03:25.900 --> 03:33.300
*

03:33.400 --> 03:35.400
- Ooh, turn left.
There's a water park.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.600
You missed it.
- We have to stay on this road.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.633
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, State Farm.
There's probably a petting zoo.

03:39.733 --> 03:41.433
Let's stop.

03:41.533 --> 03:44.767
We're not going anywhere
except for the funeral.

03:44.867 --> 03:46.900
- I'm not sweaty.

03:47.067 --> 03:49.767
I'm just concentrating
on getting there.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.633
- Turn right on Glen Road.
- Oh, God!

03:53.733 --> 03:55.900
- Yeah.
- No, it's Chunky Cheese!

03:56.067 --> 03:57.067
I have to pee.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.633
Hold it.

03:58.733 --> 04:00.533
- I can't.
It's slippery.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.133
- It's not slippery.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.733
- There's a bathroom
at Chunky Cheese's,

04:03.833 --> 04:05.067
and they've got
moving animals.

04:05.133 --> 04:07.300
Let's stop.
- Absolutely not.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.567
- Please.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.300
I'm just saying
I have to make wet.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.133
- No, you're just saying
you'd rather go

04:12.233 --> 04:15.267
to a rat-themed restaurant
than your best friend's funeral.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.367
You're avoiding.
- Oh, my gosh.

04:17.467 --> 04:20.200
That's like the least true thing
anyone's ever said, okay,

04:20.300 --> 04:23.533
because I'm frickin' psyched
to go to Chet's funeral.

04:23.633 --> 04:25.300
- You shouldn't be
psyched either.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.700
This is serious, okay?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.400
I mean, look
at what you're wearing.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.133
- Don't tell me how to grieve!

04:32.900 --> 04:35.733
I still have to one.

04:35.833 --> 04:36.867
- Okay.

04:43.633 --> 04:51.567
*

04:56.333 --> 04:58.267
Calm down.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.433
- Call it up.
- Oh, God.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.633
- Relax.
It's just me.

05:01.733 --> 05:02.633
- I know.

05:02.733 --> 05:05.933
- Here, have a juice box.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.467
- Thank you.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.700
- Oh, that's not juice.
It's wine.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.200
- Yeah, duh.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.167
Everybody knows that "juice"
is code for "wine."

05:14.267 --> 05:15.733
- Look, I'm sorry
I snapped at you earlier.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.400
- Oh, it's okay.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.667
You're not the coolest person.
I get that.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.367
- No. Wait. Yeah.

05:25.467 --> 05:26.767
Eh--

05:26.867 --> 05:28.067
Okay.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.400
- Um, when I was five,

05:30.500 --> 05:32.100
at my grandmother's funeral,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.367
my mom told me to go
give her a kiss good-bye,

05:34.467 --> 05:36.233
so I did,
but her casket

05:36.333 --> 05:38.200
was on this lowering
mechanism thingy,

05:38.300 --> 05:40.533
so they had to get me a stool
so I could reach her.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.533
And when I leaned in
to kiss her, I fell in,

05:43.633 --> 05:46.067
and the casket shut behind me,
and they couldn't get it open,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.500
so I was just trapped in there
with my dead grandmother

05:48.600 --> 05:52.433
for 15 minutes, and I haven't
been to a funeral since.

05:56.367 --> 06:00.467
- And then the cast
of "Friends" showed up.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.167
The whole cast?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.933
Wait, was Gunther there?
- No.

06:04.067 --> 06:05.433
- 'Cause it doesn't count
if he wasn't.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.833
- Forget it.
Let's just go do this thing.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.200
Fine.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.733
- Wait.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.467
- Okay, we won't go.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.300
Chet won't care that
we're not gonna be there.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.367
And, like, you're all freaked
about your grandma,

06:17.467 --> 06:19.400
and my hat's stupid,

06:19.500 --> 06:20.633
and you got me all in my head
about my shirt, so--

06:20.733 --> 06:22.533
I--
yeah, hmm.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.633
Mm, yes, now that I--

06:24.733 --> 06:27.133
- I like it.
It's nice.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.833
Yeah.
- I don't know.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.533
- No, I think it's
a really nice way

06:30.633 --> 06:35.400
to capture the moment,
okay?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.733
- Yeah. Wait.
- Gene.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.833
- Okay, we should go.
- Yeah.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.833
- I mean, Chet would be totally
bummed if I wasn't there.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.067
- Yeah.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.533
- Yeah.
- I mean, why didn't

06:45.633 --> 06:47.733
you think of that?
- I didn't think--

06:47.833 --> 06:49.800
- I shouldn't not go.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.067
- I'm his best friend.
- Yeah.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.500
- Yes.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.867
- It'd be crazy
if I wasn't there.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.133
- Okay.
- Wait.

06:55.233 --> 06:56.700
- Stop doing that,
please, okay?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.667
- Okay.
- No.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.133
- Pull into the parking lot
over there.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.200
I'll meet you outside in ten.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.733
- I have to fix this,
for Chet.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.967
- Wait, no--
- Ten!

07:08.667 --> 07:10.667
- I'm gonna vomit.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.233
- "Pairing suggestions:

07:16.333 --> 07:18.767
lukewarm lentil soup."

07:18.867 --> 07:21.167
Where is she?

07:21.267 --> 07:24.400
* I'm going to my
grandma's house--me *

07:24.500 --> 07:27.867
*

07:33.833 --> 07:37.333
*

07:37.433 --> 07:39.433
- * Ho, ah, ah

07:39.533 --> 07:41.067
*

07:41.100 --> 07:42.600
* Ow

07:42.700 --> 07:44.133
- You look sharp.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.400
- Thank you.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.733
I mean, it smells
a little armpit-y,

07:46.833 --> 07:48.433
but that's rental
territory for you.

07:48.533 --> 07:50.633
Where are all
my juice boxes?

07:50.733 --> 07:55.400
- Hey, will you make sure
Chet's coffin doesn't eat me?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.267
- Wilhelmina--

07:57.367 --> 07:58.900
- Brown.
- Brown.

07:59.067 --> 08:01.067
Wilhelmina Brown,
you're drunk.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.133
- I'm not.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.333
- You are too.

08:03.433 --> 08:04.500
- Prove it.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.167
- Name all the states in America
in alphabetical order.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.733
- Alabama, Alaska,
Arizona, Arkansas--

08:11.833 --> 08:12.900
- Reverse order.

08:13.067 --> 08:14.133
- Wyoming,
Wisconsin, West--

08:14.233 --> 08:15.667
- Australian accent.

08:15.767 --> 08:17.333
West Virginia.

08:17.433 --> 08:18.467
- In the style
of Anthony Hopkins

08:18.567 --> 08:19.667
in "Legends of the Fall."

08:19.767 --> 08:22.500
Virginia, Vermont.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.733
- Whistle.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.567
- Hoot.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.067
- Give me the keys.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.233
- Let's do this.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.133
- No, you're
on that side now.

08:30.233 --> 08:32.967
- Whoo, whoo,
whoo, hoo.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.467
- You drank them all.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.067
- Pshew.
- Selfish.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.833
Get in the car,
Billie!

08:38.933 --> 08:40.533
- Whoo-whee!
- No, open the do--

08:40.633 --> 08:43.533
Oh, gosh,
everyone can see.

08:43.633 --> 08:45.867
- It looks like we're
only eight miles away.

08:45.967 --> 08:49.967
- Hey, uh, what do you
think about this?

08:51.467 --> 08:53.900
No.
Have you ever seen drugs?

08:54.067 --> 08:56.067
No, that's my eulogy,
stupid.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.467
Read it, stupid.

08:57.567 --> 09:01.367
What are you doing?

09:01.467 --> 09:02.967
- "Loaf, poon"--

09:03.067 --> 09:05.500
"Life, pain."

09:05.600 --> 09:09.067
- "Life, pain,
all the crazy pain,

09:09.133 --> 09:11.833
"the planet's soul
is dog .

09:11.933 --> 09:14.067
"Way to go, Chet.

09:14.100 --> 09:18.133
Way to bust out
of this skin prison."

09:18.233 --> 09:19.967
- Well, keep going,
till you get to the sad part.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.333
That's the best part.

09:21.433 --> 09:24.667
- "You're all gonna
be here someday, dead,

09:24.767 --> 09:26.867
"dead as my best friend, Chet.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.700
"You--point to the oldest
person in the crowd--

09:29.800 --> 09:31.667
will probably die first."

09:31.767 --> 09:33.867
- No, the "point
to the oldest person"

09:33.967 --> 09:36.133
is a stage direction.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.933
- Oh, yeah, I think we should
tone this down a little bit.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.500
- Forget it. It's stupid.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.867
- It is not stupid.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.100
I mean, it is,
but I'll help you.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.967
You're wasted.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.100
- I am not wasted.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.967
If I was wasted,
could I do this?

09:52.767 --> 09:54.367
- You didn't do anything.
- Oh.

09:54.467 --> 09:55.633
- Panera Bread.

09:55.733 --> 09:59.133
- Get out of the way, car!

09:59.233 --> 10:00.700
- Now it smells like
Panera soup bowl in here.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.800
- Slow down.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.667
- I can't. We got to get there.
I'm gonna take a shortcut.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.500
- No, we're not that late.
Don't--don't turn.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.433
- The turn is part
of the shortcut, Billie.

10:08.533 --> 10:10.867
- Rerouting.
- Ooh, ooh, she says no.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.433
- Okay, well, I know
better than her, so...

10:12.533 --> 10:14.600
- Turn right.
- Ooh, she caught you.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.200
- She's a stupid lady

10:16.300 --> 10:18.200
doing a stupid voice-over
in a stupid booth!

10:18.300 --> 10:19.933
Now shut the  up
and eat your  soup

10:20.033 --> 10:21.333
so I can  drive!

10:21.433 --> 10:22.800
- Ooh!

10:38.100 --> 10:41.533
*

10:41.633 --> 10:43.733
- * Ho, ah, ah

10:43.833 --> 10:45.400
*

10:45.500 --> 10:46.733
* Ow

10:46.833 --> 10:54.767
*

10:58.367 --> 11:00.067
- Hey, watch yourself.

11:00.167 --> 11:03.733
You'll get joker mouth.
I just cleaned you up.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.233
- I'm gonna miss Chet.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.467
He made me feel like
I could walk on water.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.333
- He really did want
to sex with you, huh?

11:11.433 --> 11:13.600
- Yeah.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.267
I wonder if me and...

11:16.367 --> 11:17.933
- No, no.

11:18.067 --> 11:19.767
Ah.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.100
Holy crap.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.067
- The funeral starts in 20--

11:23.167 --> 11:25.067
No, no, no, ten--
no, ten minutes!

11:25.167 --> 11:27.067
- Okay, all right,
no more stops

11:27.100 --> 11:29.067
only unless they're completely
necessary, all right?

11:29.100 --> 11:30.300
- Yeah.
- The bare necessities here.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.900
- Yeah, yeah,
the basic bananas.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.633
- Code red,
level five-type--

11:33.733 --> 11:35.133
.
Paint your own ceramics!

11:35.233 --> 11:36.333
- Yeah!

11:39.433 --> 11:43.400
*

11:43.500 --> 11:45.400
Nice.
It's very primary.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.700
both: * We're going
to a funeral *

11:47.800 --> 11:49.867
* We ain't suits,
we're in suits *

11:49.967 --> 11:52.067
- * We're going
to a funeral *

11:52.133 --> 11:53.400
* We ain't

11:53.500 --> 11:55.067
Stop!

11:58.900 --> 12:01.700
Who would just leave him
out here like this?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.867
- He's already dead.

12:03.967 --> 12:05.900
Nothing anyone could do.

12:07.733 --> 12:09.367
Billie, Billie,
what are you doing?

12:09.467 --> 12:11.133
- I'm taking him with us.
- Don't touch him.

12:11.233 --> 12:13.367
- He deserves a proper burial

12:13.467 --> 12:16.567
like a normal, decent coyote!

12:16.667 --> 12:19.100
All he ever
wanted was a friend!

12:19.200 --> 12:22.067
All he ever wanted was someone
to say, "Hey, coyote,

12:22.133 --> 12:24.467
I like you.
You were nice to me."

12:24.567 --> 12:26.900
- Or like, "Hey, don't play Boo
with this big truck, coyote.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.067
"What are you thinking?

12:28.167 --> 12:29.367
"I know you want
to win the game,

12:29.467 --> 12:31.633
but there's consequences,
you know?"

12:31.733 --> 12:33.300
- Exactly.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.967
Or maybe that was me.

12:35.067 --> 12:37.300
Maybe Chet was my one chance
at true love,

12:37.400 --> 12:39.800
and now he's splattered all over
the goddamn asphalt road!

12:39.900 --> 12:40.967
- Billie, no.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.200
Don't, Billie!
Stop it!

12:44.633 --> 12:46.367
Now, I am sorry
for Mr. Coyote.

12:46.467 --> 12:47.867
I am.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.667
But I am not dishonoring
Chet by showing up

12:49.767 --> 12:53.200
with this bloody, disgusting,
freak show of an animal carcass.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.867
*

12:57.967 --> 12:59.433
*

12:59.533 --> 13:01.067
Yeah.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.833
*

13:06.933 --> 13:09.067
- * Ho, ah, ah

13:09.167 --> 13:10.900
*

13:11.067 --> 13:12.900
* Ow

13:14.533 --> 13:22.467
*

13:35.967 --> 13:37.700
- "And in the last days,
it shall be God declares

13:37.800 --> 13:39.367
"that 'I will pour forth
out my spirit

13:39.467 --> 13:41.900
upon all flesh and your sons,
and your daughters'"...

13:42.067 --> 13:45.167
- This is it. Nice shoes.
- "'Who came up against some'"--

13:45.267 --> 13:46.700
- Thank you
for your loss.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.233
I like your shoes.
They're very nice.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.733
- I'm ecstatic
for your loss.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.067
- You need to be quiet.

13:55.133 --> 13:57.067
- Is one of you
Genevieve Russell?

13:57.167 --> 13:59.533
- Oh, that's totally me.
The priest knows my name.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.833
How cool is that?
How'd you know?

14:01.933 --> 14:04.233
- Because this ceremony
ended 15 minutes ago,

14:04.333 --> 14:06.167
and we've been waiting
for a Genevieve Russell

14:06.267 --> 14:08.100
to deliver the final eulogy.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.400
- Oh, shoot.
Okay, yeah. Coming.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.100
Where's the thing?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.667
The paper.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.400
The eulogy. Where is it?
- I don't have it.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.200
I don't have it. Just wing it.
- I can't.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.667
- Just wing it.
- I'm not gonna wing it.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.367
I'm not a bird.
- Then do it. Go, go.

14:20.467 --> 14:22.300
All right.
What's wrong with your voice?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.733
Why can't you whisper?
- I don't know. I don't know.

14:27.833 --> 14:32.167
- Hey, you're the truck
driver guy, right?

14:32.267 --> 14:34.067
You're the guy
that killed Chet?

14:34.167 --> 14:35.400
- Yes.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.700
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.300
- Oh, that's okay, man.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.067
Hey, I, uh--
can I ask you a question?

14:44.133 --> 14:46.800
Were you scared?

14:46.900 --> 14:50.700
Did he scare you,
even a bit?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.567
out of me.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.067
- Yeah.

14:55.167 --> 14:56.333
Yeah, he did.

14:56.433 --> 14:57.800
- Coming.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.667
- Whoo! Yay, Gene.
Yay, Ge--

14:59.767 --> 15:02.733
- Okay.
That's enough, Billie.

15:02.833 --> 15:03.967
Hey, everybody.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.300
How's it going?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.467
Um, sorry I'm late.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.633
Not the sort of thing
you want to hurry up and get to,

15:11.733 --> 15:12.933
am I right?

15:15.867 --> 15:19.100
Chet Bingham
was a maker of apps

15:19.200 --> 15:22.533
and a lover of shadow
government conspiracy theory.

15:22.633 --> 15:26.167
He was my friend,
and I, uh...

15:26.267 --> 15:28.267
I don't have
a lot of those,

15:28.367 --> 15:32.600
so losing one
is really hard.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.833
He--he was a...

15:35.933 --> 15:37.800
Sorry.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.367
He was a...

15:40.467 --> 15:42.133
Yeah.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.500
He was a...

15:44.600 --> 15:46.600
He was a...

15:48.867 --> 15:51.667
To know!

15:51.767 --> 15:53.833
He was a...

15:53.933 --> 15:56.800
- Okay.
- What I'm trying to say is...

15:58.933 --> 16:00.333
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

16:00.433 --> 16:01.733
Move, sir. Please.

16:01.833 --> 16:04.233
I got this.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.767
- Okay.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.833
- I'm sorry.

16:07.933 --> 16:10.400
I feel like an idiot.
Move your Bible.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.933
- Move your Bible.
- Jesus.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.100
Hold this with your--

16:14.200 --> 16:16.300
- Hold it with
your holy hands.

16:19.867 --> 16:24.600
I have never seen anyone
try and evade the pain of loss

16:24.700 --> 16:26.633
as much as this woman
has today.

16:26.733 --> 16:28.100
- Is it

16:28.200 --> 16:30.800
because she's a bad person?
- Yes.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.267
- No. Is it because
she has the maturity

16:34.367 --> 16:36.500
of a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle,

16:36.600 --> 16:39.067
a TMNT?
No.

16:39.167 --> 16:42.300
It is because her heart

16:42.400 --> 16:45.567
is as big as Chet's head
in this poster behind me,

16:45.667 --> 16:47.233
which, if I am not mistaken,

16:47.333 --> 16:49.100
has been sneaking up
this whole time

16:49.200 --> 16:51.067
trying to push me in the coffin!
No.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.067
- No, sir! You won't have me!
- No. Billie. Someone. Someone.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.567
- Stop it!
- Get her off of there!

16:54.667 --> 16:55.800
- You will never--
- Get her off. Don't--

16:55.900 --> 16:56.900
- Billie.
- I'll kill you!

16:57.067 --> 16:57.933
- Billie!

16:58.067 --> 16:59.400
- Get off of him!

16:59.500 --> 17:00.867
- You're not gonna
take me with you!

17:00.967 --> 17:02.067
- Get off of him.
- I'm embarrassed.

17:02.133 --> 17:04.467
I'm embarrassed now,
please.

17:04.567 --> 17:05.867
Don't look at me.

17:05.967 --> 17:08.067
- Sorry about that scene.

17:11.333 --> 17:14.567
This was Chet's favorite food.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.067
The first time
he had a Gunny Worm,

17:17.133 --> 17:19.633
he said they're almost as good
as the real thing.

17:23.633 --> 17:27.200
Enjoy, buddy.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.433
These are croutons
from Chet's favorite chain

17:30.533 --> 17:32.067
restaurant, Panara Bread.

17:32.133 --> 17:33.800
- Panera.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.400
- And this is Chet's
favorite alcohol, boxed wine,

17:37.500 --> 17:40.067
or, as he liked to call it,
the loose juice,

17:40.167 --> 17:42.967
which was always funny when
he said it because of his esses.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.600
*

17:44.700 --> 17:46.233
Drink up, sailor.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.633
- I know.
You're Hank's dad.

17:48.733 --> 17:49.867
Yeah, you are.

17:49.967 --> 17:51.767
- And this, this is a plate

17:51.867 --> 17:55.367
that I hand-painted today
at Paint Your Own Ceramics.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.400
It's part of the reason
I was tardy.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.867
That's me with the yellow hair,

18:00.067 --> 18:01.200
and that's Chet,

18:01.300 --> 18:03.500
and we're dancing in the sunset.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.533
And I have a glow around me
'cause I've got radiant skin.

18:07.633 --> 18:12.467
And he's got a glow around him
'cause he's a new ghost.

18:12.567 --> 18:13.600
And on the back it says,

18:13.700 --> 18:15.933
"Best Friends Forever,"

18:16.067 --> 18:20.200
'cause I will never have
another friend like Chet again,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
and I'm really scared
about that.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.567
*

18:25.967 --> 18:28.267
Damn it. Okay.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.233
I'll miss you, buddy.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.367
- Everyone be cool
about this.

18:33.467 --> 18:34.700
No, Billie, don't.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.833
- Yeah.

18:43.933 --> 18:46.567
Or--

18:46.667 --> 18:50.533
You'll let me know, yeah?

18:50.633 --> 18:52.067
- We should get going.

18:52.133 --> 18:53.667
We only have 15 minutes
left to get back.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.200
- Yeah, can I just have
a few more minutes alone?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.067
- Of course.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.900
What am I gonna do
without you, bud?

19:07.067 --> 19:08.400
- Ugh.
Leave me alone.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.733
- I said leave me alone.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.767
I don't need you, Patrick.

19:14.867 --> 19:17.067
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.567
Don't pick me up.
You know what?

19:18.667 --> 19:21.100
I hope a truck
full of Mexicans come by

19:21.200 --> 19:22.767
and I get G-banged
by all of 'em.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.233
And that's on you!

19:24.333 --> 19:26.067
It's not on me!
That's on you!

19:26.100 --> 19:27.333
That's what I hope.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.733
Hello? Dang it.

19:30.833 --> 19:34.667
Whatever, you're just mad
because I play saxophone.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.167
- Hey.

19:36.267 --> 19:37.267
- Hey.

Nothing.
What about you?

in my car.

Maybe I could give you a lift or
you can come over and hang out?
