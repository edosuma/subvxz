00:09.300 --> 00:10.343
Paige.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.888
-How did you--?
-Can I come in?

00:13.972 --> 00:15.807
-Yeah, yeah, of course.
-Thanks.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.815
Julia, this is Paige.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.275
Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.192
You too.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.321
You know what? I'm, um...

00:31.614 --> 00:35.744
-I'm gonna let you two talk.
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

00:35.827 --> 00:36.661
It's okay.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.249
I...

00:43.960 --> 00:45.211
I had no idea.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.131
I understand.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.633
Call me later, okay?

00:58.933 --> 01:01.186
How, and where...?

01:02.187 --> 01:04.314
I've been staying
at a women's shelter in Mendocino

01:04.397 --> 01:05.815
where they have free legal aid.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.903
Listen, when I couldn't get ahold
of Sally, I tracked her down and--

01:11.488 --> 01:14.032
She told me
that Vince took Christopher to get to me.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.450
She's the one who set me up.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.162
So it's true? Vince has Christopher?

01:20.246 --> 01:22.540
-He took him.
-Oh, God.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.502
I'm so sorry.
I am doing everything to get him back.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.462
Oh, no, my boy.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.882
Where's my boy?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.773
Come on, Jack. Keep going.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.400
Let's go.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.069
<i>Jack?</i>

01:56.658 --> 01:58.827
Adam! No!

01:59.452 --> 02:01.204
Hey, Jack. Hey.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.874
Hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.003
It's okay. You were just having
a nightmare. It's all right.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.381
You were thrashing around.

02:12.966 --> 02:13.842
I'm sorry.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.759
It's okay.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.429
Are you okay?

02:22.892 --> 02:24.853
Me and my brother, Adam, were...

02:25.478 --> 02:26.855
We were on the roof and...

02:29.941 --> 02:31.067
he crossed first...

02:34.696 --> 02:35.530
and I...

02:37.365 --> 02:38.199
And I--

02:48.251 --> 02:49.752
I froze.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.089
He came--

02:54.215 --> 02:55.842
He came back to get me.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.014
And he slipped and fell.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.476
Baby, that was your dream?

03:05.560 --> 03:06.477
-No.
-Yeah?

03:10.231 --> 03:11.524
It's what happened.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.821
What? Oh, honey, come here. Come here.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.489
It's okay.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.733
The doctor will see you now.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.327
Hey.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.915
-We don't have to be here.
-I wanna be here. I wanna do this.

04:08.998 --> 04:13.670
-Sure? It's okay if you change your mind.
-I have not changed my mind. Promise.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.923
We can fight Cassandra
in court without the test.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.550
I don't wanna do that
unless it's necessary.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.137
-We're doing this.
-Okay.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.440
What's up?

04:35.191 --> 04:38.611
Just-- Cameron is being weird.
Well, he's...

04:40.363 --> 04:43.741
He's not responding to text messages and
he's been distant the last couple days.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.827
It's like he's trying to avoid me.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.413
He's probably got something else going on.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.666
Yeah. I'm probably being paranoid.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.132
So how was your session with Barry?

05:00.675 --> 05:01.509
Fine.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.055
Yeah? Did you tell him about your brother
and the dream that you had?

05:06.139 --> 05:06.973
Mm-hm.

05:07.765 --> 05:08.850
What did he say?

05:10.727 --> 05:13.438
He said that because my family never...

05:15.356 --> 05:19.777
even talked about Adam,
I probably have unprocessed grief.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.989
It was fun to hear that.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.619
What do you think?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.581
I don't know.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.627
I never even thought about it
till I found a photo of him

05:36.711 --> 05:37.879
in my storage unit.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.550
Wasn't that the day of Joey's wedding?

05:43.509 --> 05:44.427
Mm-hm.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.388
-Why didn't you say something?
-Didn't want you to think

05:47.472 --> 05:51.309
-that I was just making some excuse.
-No, I'd never think that.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.562
Well, anyway,
I don't know what set me off.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.730
Maybe it was that.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.360
I haven't said his name in over 20 years.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.864
Why didn't your family talk about him?

06:04.947 --> 06:06.657
Well, my parents were gutted.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.995
They just wanted to forget.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.540
Brie was too young to remember.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.210
Oh, sweetheart.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.381
I'm so sorry.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.008
You must have felt so alone.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.721
Hmm. I did. I, um...

06:30.640 --> 06:33.935
Maybe that's why I blocked it out.
I didn't have any other way to deal.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.646
But you're dealing with it now.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.108
Yeah, that wasn't my idea, though, was it?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.027
But you're still doing it.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.447
-Yeah.
-And that's all that matters, right?

06:47.657 --> 06:52.537
You know, it takes a lot of strength
to deal with something that is so painful.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.622
Thanks.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.000
Miss Monroe, Mr. Sheridan,
we're ready for you.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.013
So my question is,

07:11.097 --> 07:15.393
Hope's behavior, deciding to drive,
canceling appointments, lying,

07:15.476 --> 07:17.770
how much of that relates to her TBI?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.984
It's impossible
to put a precise percentage on it,

07:23.818 --> 07:27.697
but safe to say, her injury
is affecting her decision-making.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.532
See, Vernon? None of this is my fault.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.827
-Let's go. Thank you for your time.
-Hope, we are not finished.

07:32.910 --> 07:38.624
Um, now, if that is the case,
what can we do to ensure she'll be safe

07:38.708 --> 07:42.295
-while receiving the proper treatment?
-Wrap me in bubble wrap, why don't you?

07:42.378 --> 07:46.549
Have you considered a home health aide?
Someone who can oversee your day-to-day?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.552
I do not want or need a babysitter.

07:49.635 --> 07:53.556
In that case, you would qualify
for a residential facility.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.143
There's no way I'm going
to some old folk's home.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.104
I wouldn't dismiss the idea so quickly.

08:00.605 --> 08:06.152
This is a rehabilitation center
that specializes in neural trauma.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.864
You'll have daily access
to physical and cognitive therapy.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.825
You wouldn't have to cook or clean.
That'll all be done for you.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.872
While the absence of chores sounds lovely,
I want to live in my own house,

08:17.955 --> 08:19.999
not some 7-by-10 dorm room.

08:20.082 --> 08:23.252
Honey, we are trying
to make sure you're taken care of

08:23.336 --> 08:24.754
so you can get better.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.464
I am getting better.

08:26.547 --> 08:30.885
I just made some unfortunate choices,
I told you. It won't happen again.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.931
Hope, honey, I don't think
this is something you could control.

08:44.065 --> 08:44.982
I called Vince.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.111
Sally gave me a number
where I could reach him.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.406
He has agreed to an exchange.
He'll give up Christopher

08:52.490 --> 08:53.574
-if I go with him.
-No.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.203
-No way, that is a nonstarter.
-We have no choice, Preacher.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.165
They're staying
in a mountainside cabin in Trinity County.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.085
He gave me GPS coordinates.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.213
-Okay. Gonna loop in Mike.
-No.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.132
No. If the cops get involved,
they'll arrest us both.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.510
-Then who will look after Christopher?
-I'll go after him.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.596
-I have to--
-Trust me. It's better if I go alone.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.517
-Sally could be setting us up again.
-No, if I am there, he'll make the swap,

09:19.600 --> 09:22.144
but if things go wrong,
I will never see my boy again.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.938
-Paige, please.
-And I can't--

09:25.189 --> 09:27.275
Now, you send me those coordinates.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.111
I'll bring Christopher home.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.781
Okay.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.335
-How was your test? You didn't say.
-It was fine. They took a blood sample.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.630
Mine was a cheek swab. Took ten seconds.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.340
Really?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.341
Mm.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.427
-Guys have it so easy.
-Not true.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.595
-It is.
-It is not.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.930
Yeah?
Gonna squeeze a watermelon out of your--?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.600
Oh, wait. Whoa, whoa, I don't need-- No.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.060
Message received. Thank you.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.687
-Okay, good.
-Yeah, okay.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.067
When are you gonna go meet Nick?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.570
It's supposed to be about 1:30.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.117
Think he's serious
about investing in this glamping business?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.494
Well, I certainly hope so.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.414
This could change everything for us.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.041
Yeah.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.128
Well, even if he doesn't,
we're gonna be fine. Okay?

10:33.174 --> 10:35.843
Anybody else
would have given up on me by now.

10:37.011 --> 10:37.928
But you didn't.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.223
You pulled me back from somewhere dark.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.729
-Yeah, you did the same for me.
-And I would do it again.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.900
-And again and again.
-You're ridiculous.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.276
Oh, that may be true.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.569
Mm-hm.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.114
You're so beautiful.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.090
-Hey. Come on in.
-Hi. Thanks.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.549
Nice.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.761
-What are we up to?
-We're making posters and a banner

11:18.844 --> 11:22.973
so when Jack drives Ricky out of town,
Ricky will have a crowd cheering him on.

11:23.057 --> 11:26.310
-That's awesome of you to organize that.
-Saw it on TikTok. Looked cool.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.228
I bet.

11:28.145 --> 11:31.857
-How far have you gotten?
-I finished these signs, and Connie...

11:36.487 --> 11:37.446
Connie made this one.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.658
-Who's Rick?
-She didn't leave enough room for the Y.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.034
We can do better than that.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.912
I can stay as long as you need.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.086
-Thanks for helping me with this.
-Of course.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.549
What do you think of this slogan,
"Kick boot camp's butt"?

11:56.632 --> 11:58.509
-It's perfect.
-Mm-hm.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.857
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.496
Where did all this tea come from?

12:28.289 --> 12:31.876
Oh. Yeah, I went to the store.
And there's orange juice in the fridge.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.128
Orange juice, huh?

12:36.839 --> 12:37.715
Wow.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.135
-You bought all of this?
-Yeah, that's what happens

12:41.218 --> 12:42.344
when I shop hungry.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.183
Oh. Just decided to stock the fridge?

12:47.975 --> 12:51.061
-Thought it'd be nice.
-Well, it is nice. Thank you.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.691
Hey. Sorry for busting in.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.904
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.490
-Brady, this is Dr. Hayek.
-Yeah, we met at the wedding.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.658
-Yes, we did. Hey.
-Hey.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.286
-Doc's not here. You can use his office.
-Great.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.163
-We can talk in here.
-Okay.

13:13.959 --> 13:14.794
So...

13:16.086 --> 13:19.215
-what can I do for you?
-Sorry for not calling first.

13:19.298 --> 13:23.761
Uh, I just didn't know what to do
or who to talk to.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.346
It's okay. Not a problem.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.682
Whatever I say, it's confidential, right?

13:28.766 --> 13:31.977
Absolutely.
HIPAA ensures you have complete privacy.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.188
-Good.
-Do you wanna sit down?

13:34.271 --> 13:35.981
Yeah. Yeah.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.529
So it's not about me.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.864
Um, it's about Brie.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.742
What her ex did to her.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.577
I know she told you.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.830
And it's why I came to you.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.669
-Right. Does she know that you're here?
-No, but I didn't know what else to do.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.586
I...

13:58.879 --> 14:02.007
I have all this rage.

14:02.091 --> 14:06.470
And I know I can't show her,
and I wanna help, but I...

14:07.847 --> 14:08.722
I don't know how.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.141
Have you asked her
if there's anything you can do?

14:11.225 --> 14:14.311
I tried to.
She said she's fine, so I haven't pushed.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.565
Okay. Well, that is the right thing to do.

14:17.648 --> 14:21.318
You know? If she wants to talk,
you listen, and if she doesn't,

14:21.819 --> 14:24.113
I mean, you just let her know
you're there for her.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.030
Okay.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.658
I don't wanna say the wrong thing,
you know?

14:27.741 --> 14:29.326
Yeah, I understand.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.620
Um...

14:36.250 --> 14:39.670
Here is a pamphlet
from the House of Grace.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.883
It's a rape crisis center in Grace Valley.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.844
It has a condensed guide

14:46.927 --> 14:49.597
on how
to support sexual assault survivors.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.184
For instance,
you know, verbalize your support.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.229
Don't make threats
against the perpetrator.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.397
Too late for that.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.358
But I'll stop.

15:03.027 --> 15:08.782
You know, there are also resources
for friends and families of survivors.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.785
Yeah, it didn't happen to me, so...

15:11.869 --> 15:14.163
Yeah. But you have feelings about it.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.582
You said you were angry.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.209
Yeah, a bit.

15:21.211 --> 15:26.842
It's just messed up, you know,
that someone would do that to her.

15:28.552 --> 15:33.557
I love Brie and she--
She does not deserve this.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.102
I know. Nobody does.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.823
-Not too many shifts left.
-I got like three more?

15:49.907 --> 15:52.076
Don't forget.
I'm taking you to the bus station.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.286
Thanks for that. Oh, and Preacher called.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.539
He said he left you a message.
He wanted you to know he can't come in.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.043
Oh, okay. Can you call Hannah
and see if she can cover closing?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.044
Yeah, for sure.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.213
-Hey. Where have you been this morning?
-Hey.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.883
You don't have to tell me
if it's a secret.

16:08.759 --> 16:09.593
Come here.

16:14.098 --> 16:18.560
-Okay, now you're freaking me out.
-It's just we're not telling anyone yet.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.020
What?

16:21.146 --> 16:22.064
Mel's pregnant.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.192
Oh, my God.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.362
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.572
But, please, do not tell anyone.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.076
Okay. Thanks for telling me.
I feel honored.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.411
You're my sister.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.914
-Oh, so Joey knows?
-It's not a competition, dude.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.666
I'm teasing.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.043
You know, I'm so excited for you.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.256
You're gonna have three kids.
Can you believe that?

16:48.048 --> 16:48.882
No.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.385
No, I cannot.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.222
Well, don't be nervous.
You're gonna be a great dad.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.684
Thanks.
And I got a meeting this afternoon.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.145
If that goes well,
hopefully I can pay for all this.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.980
If you need money, I've got savings.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.983
No, that's sweet, but I got a good feeling
about this investor.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.236
Okay, good.
If it doesn't work out, let me know.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.573
Thank you.
Knock wood, it's not gonna come to that.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.117
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.161
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.162
Okay.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.913
-Good stuff.
-Mum's the word.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.874
I think auntie's the word.

17:26.336 --> 17:27.671
Thanks for everything.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.674
If you need anything, please let me know.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.009
I will.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.852
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.272
-Did you buy this?
-No, I did not.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.400
You curious how it got here?

17:48.484 --> 17:52.154
Not particularly.
I have some bigger fish to fry.

17:53.864 --> 17:54.865
Oh.

17:54.948 --> 17:55.949
What's going on?

17:56.658 --> 18:01.830
Well, we went to see
Hope's neurologist this morning.

18:02.539 --> 18:06.502
-What'd she say?
-She is going to need some supervision.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.671
Oh, what was Hope's response to that?

18:09.755 --> 18:15.427
Oh, she had a couple of choice words,
which are too indecent to repeat.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.722
Fortunately, she saved her rant
for the drive home.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.683
She is such a spitfire.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.478
I just-- I don't know what to do.

18:24.561 --> 18:29.858
I mean, she is adamantly against
checking into a rehab center.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.945
And she doesn't want
a stranger coming over to help.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.822
Yeah. What about a compromise?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.032
What if you can find
someone who knows Hope

18:37.116 --> 18:39.201
that's capable of handling her day-to-day?

18:39.284 --> 18:40.285
Oh.

18:41.537 --> 18:45.124
-That's a tall order, don't you think?
-What do you think?

18:45.207 --> 18:50.754
Unfortunately, I think
the doctor is right.

18:52.589 --> 18:57.886
Well, then, as you've advised me in
the past, don't let yourself be a doormat.

19:01.056 --> 19:05.102
Yes, that is good advice. Thank you.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.397
Thank you for reminding me
of my good advice.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.731
Yes.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.444
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.238
Hey, I'm taking you to lunch.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.323
What about the clinic?

19:18.407 --> 19:22.077
-It's quiet. I'm sure Doc won't mind.
-Can we do this another time?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.621
-I got food from home.
-You can eat that tomorrow.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.752
-So this is happening?
-Yes, it is. Grab your coat. Let's go.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.423
All right.
I'll just put this in the fridge.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.385
Then don't go.
I mean, it's not like she's your sister.

19:38.468 --> 19:41.930
Well, she's my sister-in-law,
and I promised Nick.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.599
It's only for one dinner.

19:44.433 --> 19:48.020
-Why don't you guys like her?
-She's, pardon my expression,

19:48.103 --> 19:50.022
-a ballbuster.
-It's true.

19:51.315 --> 19:55.611
Nick would kill me for telling you this,
but there's a family trust.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.904
She makes the decisions.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.740
Once a month, he gets a check,
and he's supposed to keep his mouth shut.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.993
I'd be happy
to keep my mouth shut and collect a check.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.330
Please. Like you'd ever
let someone else call the shots.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.041
I don't think I've met her.
How do you know her?

20:09.124 --> 20:13.795
-We met at Nick and Jo Ellen's wedding.
-You guys have been friends a long time.

20:13.879 --> 20:18.091
Well, actually,
Lydie babysat me when I was a kid.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.093
She's the reason I moved to Virgin River.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.805
I remember she called me
and said she'd found paradise.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.934
When I got here, I met Nick.
The rest is history.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.644
I don't think I knew that.

20:29.186 --> 20:34.566
I swear, my memory is fading faster
than a Tide pod in a washing machine.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.152
Throw in a TBI,
and you got yourself a party.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.030
Anyway, enough about me.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.991
Lydie, how are you doing
with Ricky getting ready to leave?

20:43.075 --> 20:48.121
Oh, I'm fine,
but I think he's a little nervous.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.248
Mm.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.250
Yeah, I mean, it's a big step.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.835
If you ever need anything,
you can call me.

20:53.919 --> 20:58.257
Well, thank you, dear.
That's very kind. But I'll be fine.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.133
-Hey!
-Hey!

23:08.136 --> 23:08.970
What's this?

23:10.764 --> 23:13.558
Got an extra generator
you might be able to use.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.770
-Collecting dust over at our place.
-Thanks.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.064
-Yeah.
-What do you want for it?

23:19.147 --> 23:19.981
Oh, nothing.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.861
Jo Ellen's been trying to get me
to clear out the storage shed for ages.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.866
I also got a bunch of string lights
for you from Jo Ellen.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.286
She buys them
like they're going out of style.

23:33.787 --> 23:37.707
I gotta give you something for that.
You could-- You sell it, make good money.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.459
I can't be bothered. It's all right.

23:40.293 --> 23:43.505
-Well, thank you.
-That's all right. I'm happy to help.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.051
I still wanna talk to you
about the business plan.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.178
We're still on for drinks,
later at the bar?

23:50.262 --> 23:51.513
-That'd be great.
-Okay.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.639
-All right.
-See you.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.682
-See you then.
-Great.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.100
Cheers.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.694
Here are the lemonade,
and iced tea for the gentleman.

24:05.777 --> 24:06.862
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

24:08.071 --> 24:08.905
Cheers.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.283
-What are we celebrating?
-Your generosity.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.869
That Dyson fan was very fancy.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.955
It does get stuffy in some of those rooms,

24:17.038 --> 24:19.708
and I know Doc isn't about
to upgrade the air-conditioning.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.625
Very true.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.920
So, what are you gonna have?

24:24.671 --> 24:25.589
Mm.

24:25.672 --> 24:30.844
I'm either gonna have
the salad or the bigeye tuna.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.347
No, tuna is very high in mercury,
which can be dangerous when you're...

24:35.098 --> 24:37.184
When you are...?

24:42.397 --> 24:43.857
-Pregnant.
-Mm-hm.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.609
Which, of course, you already know.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.902
Mm-hm.

24:47.652 --> 24:51.156
-How did you figure it out?
-I accidentally stuck my head in

24:51.239 --> 24:53.241
and I overheard you telling someone.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.328
-What did you overhear?
-That you were pregnant.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.164
I walked away when I realized
it was a private conversation.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.041
-Oh.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.168
I should've been honest,
but when it happened,

25:03.251 --> 25:06.421
I panicked and I didn't know
how to bring it up again.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.132
Oh, no, you know, it's totally fine.

25:09.216 --> 25:13.303
Um, just could you do me a favor
and not mention it to anybody?

25:13.386 --> 25:15.805
We're not telling anyone right now.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.641
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Thanks.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.435
-So how you feeling?
-I'm fine.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.979
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I mean, I'm tired.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.983
But, you know,
the nausea has kind of let up, so...

25:27.067 --> 25:28.610
-Oh, that's good.
-Yeah.

25:28.693 --> 25:32.489
-And how about Jack?
-Oh, he's very excited. We both are.

25:34.157 --> 25:37.744
Anything you need. If you want me to
cover shifts or drive you to appointments.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.580
I'm sure Jack will,
but if he's not available to.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.707
That's very thoughtful. Thank you.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.835
-Can we redo the toast?
-Sure.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.756
To you becoming a mother
and to your very lucky baby.

25:49.839 --> 25:50.840
Thank you.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.031
I'm sorry I got upset this morning.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.284
You weren't the one
who suggested I need a handler.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.120
Honestly...

26:21.746 --> 26:23.540
I can't say that I disagree with her.

26:24.499 --> 26:29.588
Think of all the good having regular
cognitive and physical therapy would be.

26:29.671 --> 26:30.839
I already go to both.

26:30.922 --> 26:34.801
Only once a week, but if you're
in a center, it would be every day.

26:34.884 --> 26:41.308
Vernon, my cousin, Sylvie, went into one
of those places and ended up dying there.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.060
If I'm gonna check out, I want it to be
in the comfort of my own home.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.229
Nobody is talking about dying.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.399
And your cousin
was 15 years older than you.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.652
I don't care.
I'm dead set against it. Pun intended.

26:53.987 --> 26:58.033
Okay, then. I must insist
on having someone come to the house.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.660
-I don't want--
-Hope, stop, please.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.372
This is one argument
you are not going to win.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.546
We make a good team.

27:12.088 --> 27:15.175
-They look good.
-Yeah. Think he's gonna love it.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.092
I hope so.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.180
So Connie won't be home until later.

27:20.263 --> 27:23.308
So you wanna hang out upstairs?

27:23.850 --> 27:27.270
-Uh, I should probably go.
-You said you were free today.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.774
Um-- Well, I just--

27:31.441 --> 27:33.360
-I don't think we should.
-I don't get you.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.155
You like me. You don't like me.
We kiss, and then you're not into it?

27:37.238 --> 27:38.698
-It's not you.
-Then what is it?

27:39.574 --> 27:42.202
-I can't explain it.
-You're making me feel like crap.

27:42.285 --> 27:46.539
I've made it clear that I like you,
and you can't decide if you like me back.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.668
-I told you. I'm not in the right place.
-What does that mean?

27:49.751 --> 27:53.129
The right place for what?
To hook up? Have a relationship?

27:53.213 --> 27:56.049
-I don't wanna hurt you.
-Then be honest with me.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.885
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.639
Can we be friends, and leave it at that?

28:05.100 --> 28:08.353
-That's what you want, to just be friends?
-No.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.899
No, I just--
That's all I can do right now.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.527
I can't be friends
with someone who's hiding something.

28:16.027 --> 28:19.823
That's not how friendship works.
At least not for me.

28:20.615 --> 28:24.452
-Okay. I got it. I'll leave you alone.
-Are you fricking serious?

28:26.413 --> 28:29.791
You'd rather stop hanging out
than tell me whatever it is?

28:29.874 --> 28:31.710
Yeah. Sorry.

28:48.226 --> 28:52.731
A veggie wrap and Diet Coke. The wrap
comes with french fries or side salad.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.566
I'm doing the french fries.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.900
Good choice.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.403
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, Hope. How you doing?

28:58.486 --> 28:59.446
Just peachy.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.950
-What can I get you?
-Pie. Apple. Whipped cream.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.162
-Don't try to sell me sugar-free nonsense.
-I wouldn't dream of it.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.624
You having a good day?

29:11.708 --> 29:15.044
You would not believe
the conversation I had with Vernon.

29:15.128 --> 29:15.962
Try me.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.341
He is insisting
that we hire a home health aide.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.510
What's so bad about that?

29:23.136 --> 29:26.473
How'd you like it if some stranger came in
and started bossing you around?

29:26.556 --> 29:28.767
Well, would that stranger do laundry?

29:29.517 --> 29:31.895
-I suppose.
-Then I don't think I'd mind.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.483
You're saying that
because it's what Vernon wants.

29:36.566 --> 29:40.904
No, I'm not. I'm thinking it must be nice
to have someone who cares enough

29:40.987 --> 29:43.406
to wanna fight you about hiring help.

29:43.490 --> 29:48.161
Easy for you to say, you can do whatever
you want. You're completely independent.

29:48.661 --> 29:52.916
Well, that's very true. But what if I fall
and I can't get to the phone?

29:53.625 --> 29:56.169
How long before somebody would notice?

29:56.252 --> 30:00.632
Would I just be laying there on the floor
rotting like some piece of fruit?

30:00.715 --> 30:02.342
That's a little dramatic, isn't it?

30:02.425 --> 30:06.095
I live by myself. I don't have
someone who's keeping tabs on me

30:06.179 --> 30:09.015
or wondering
where I'm going, what I'm doing.

30:09.098 --> 30:13.019
If I were you, I'd be grateful that
you have someone looking out for you.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
I can be grateful
and still not want a nanny.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.356
Oh, for the love of Pete.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.734
Just give it a try before you decide
it's not for you. Thank you.

30:20.860 --> 30:21.694
Enjoy.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.155
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.240
Yeah.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.325
Alrighty, ready to go?

30:27.408 --> 30:29.369
-What about the check?
-I got it.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.665
-You shouldn't have done that.
-That's okay. You can get next time.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.585
There is something I need to tell you.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.297
Um, I know that we haven't
known each other for long,

30:42.173 --> 30:44.092
but I feel like we've gotten quite close.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.301
Uh-huh.

30:45.385 --> 30:50.640
And if I'm being completely honest, I care
about you. Maybe a bit more than I should.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.017
Oh. Um...

30:53.726 --> 30:57.939
-Cameron, I don't feel that way--
-This is not about us. It's...

30:59.941 --> 31:03.528
It's about Jack.
And I wouldn't have said anything,

31:03.611 --> 31:08.283
but now that you're pregnant,
I'm concerned. When--

31:08.867 --> 31:12.912
-When he didn't show up...
-Oh, no. Oh, Cameron.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.375
It-- That was an isolated incident.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.628
-I promise. He apologized.
-I get that.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.924
When your baby is born, you're gonna need
someone you can count on.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.802
Someone that's gonna be there for you,
and I'm afraid he's--

31:27.886 --> 31:29.429
Where is this coming from?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.892
My ex-fiancée is an alcoholic.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.143
And I'm sorry.

31:35.226 --> 31:39.564
I am not equating her to Jack,
but you have to think of your future.

31:40.982 --> 31:45.194
Listen, your experience with your ex
is not my experience with Jack.

31:45.278 --> 31:48.239
That might be true. But I remember
the first time Michelle didn't come home

31:48.323 --> 31:50.992
because she was out drinking.
And I remember the second--

31:51.075 --> 31:53.161
I'm gonna stop you there. From now on,

31:53.244 --> 31:55.788
I think we should stick
to being co-workers.

32:06.382 --> 32:11.179
I don't wanna pressure you, but I would
love to hear your thoughts on my proposal.

32:11.679 --> 32:14.140
Well, yeah, I thought it was good.

32:14.724 --> 32:19.270
In fact, I think your projections for
the first two years were on the low end.

32:20.563 --> 32:23.232
Do you think
the profit share could be higher?

32:23.816 --> 32:26.653
With the B&B referrals,
it's highly likely.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.031
That's good to hear. That's good, right?

32:42.502 --> 32:44.796
Nick, this is triple
the amount we talked about.

32:44.879 --> 32:46.881
Sure you're comfortable
putting this much in?

32:46.965 --> 32:52.136
I believe that betting on Jack Sheridan is
the smartest investment a guy could make.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.697
-Hey.
-Hey.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.991
-Sorry I'm late.
-Where have you been?

33:13.074 --> 33:16.744
-We missed the previews.
-It's no big deal. We can get tickets.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.247
The big deal
is I've been waiting here for ten minutes

33:19.330 --> 33:21.332
and previews are my favorite part.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.334
-You know that.
-I do, I'm sorry.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.877
I got caught up at work.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.132
-I've been trying to reach you all day.
-Yeah.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.385
I went to see Mel earlier.

33:32.885 --> 33:35.972
Had a few questions
about what happened to you.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.392
I didn't wanna screw up
and say the wrong thing.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.145
If I was out of line, I'm sorry.

33:42.645 --> 33:45.440
I just-- I wanted to know
the best way to support you.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.900
I told you, I wanna forget about it.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.654
I know, but I've never been
in this situation, so I--

33:51.738 --> 33:53.865
This is why I didn't wanna tell you.

33:55.950 --> 33:59.662
The way you're looking at me.
Like you feel sorry for me.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.206
What? No. God, no.

34:02.790 --> 34:05.168
That is not it. I love you.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.296
And I wanna help you.

34:09.464 --> 34:13.176
And what you're seeing is--
Is me having no idea what I'm doing.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.553
Please. I'm an idiot.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.806
But I am trying to do right by you.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.852
-Okay.
-Okay?

34:24.270 --> 34:28.649
-Okay, you're not mad at me?
-No. Your intention was sweet.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.445
Well, I meant every word. I love you.

34:33.946 --> 34:34.947
I love you too.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.285
-Mm. There it is.
-What?

34:39.368 --> 34:41.079
That gorgeous smile of yours.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.792
-Yeah, you bring it out of me.
-I wanna make you happy.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.052
So you wanna go see a movie or what?

34:56.135 --> 34:57.345
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

34:57.428 --> 34:58.304
Mm-hm.

35:30.044 --> 35:33.297
-Paige?
-Preach!

35:33.381 --> 35:36.217
Hey, oh, hey! Buddy!

35:37.176 --> 35:38.511
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.975
-How'd you get here?
-Uncle Vince dropped me off.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.186
-Where's your mom?
-She left with him.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.523
She said she'd see me soon,
but then she started crying.

35:50.606 --> 35:51.440
Did she...?

35:52.525 --> 35:57.363
-Did she say where they were going?
-No, but she told me to give you this.

36:19.844 --> 36:24.056
So I just got off the phone
with the insurance company.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.309
And?

36:26.392 --> 36:29.312
I told them
we're not gonna contest the claim...

36:30.229 --> 36:32.231
we'll just pay it and move on.

36:33.900 --> 36:37.528
-Thank you for handling that for me.
-Yeah. You're welcome.

36:38.529 --> 36:43.534
-Now, there is still the issue--
-I know. I've thought about what you said.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.955
And I'm willing
to hire an aide on a trial basis.

36:48.998 --> 36:51.083
Well, okay, then.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.045
I am glad we're on the same page.

36:54.128 --> 36:59.884
All I ask is during the hiring process,
I have veto power, which I will not abuse.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.680
As long as you plan on being reasonable.

37:04.764 --> 37:05.598
I do.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.934
I owe you a thank-you.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.438
-For what?
-For caring so much about me.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.523
I'm lucky to have you.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.859
Oh, no, no, no.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.570
I am the lucky one.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.242
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.577
-How was your day?
-Good.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.747
Helped Lizzie make
some going-away signs for Ricky.

37:29.830 --> 37:30.957
Oh. That was nice of you.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.000
-Have you had dinner?
-Not yet.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.338
Um, I'm not feeling that good.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.757
You're probably hungry.
Let me heat up some chicken.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.384
You don't have to do that.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.804
-Denny? Denny?
-Denny.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.389
-Denny?
-Oh, my God.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.182
Denny, can you hear me?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.309
-Call 911.
-Okay.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.025
Denny?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.487
Have a good night, you two.

38:07.201 --> 38:09.328
Doesn't that guy know how to read a room?

38:10.579 --> 38:12.665
You take out the trash.
I'll deal with him.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.380
We're closing up.
Let me know when you're done.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.966
I was hoping to run into a friend of mine.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.469
-You might know her. Brie Sheridan?
-I know Brie.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.638
Any idea where I might find her?

38:27.722 --> 38:31.642
-We used to work together in Sacramento.
-Her brother owns the bar.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.728
If you come by tomorrow,
he might help you.

38:33.811 --> 38:37.773
Anything more specific, like an address?

38:38.899 --> 38:40.318
I wanna surprise her.

38:42.361 --> 38:45.614
A, I don't give out
other people's personal information,

38:46.115 --> 38:51.829
and B, I'm not into guys, so
whatever this is isn't gonna work on me.

39:13.267 --> 39:17.605
So, technically,
we're gonna sleep in there

39:17.688 --> 39:19.732
-and not outside, right?
-Yes.

39:20.274 --> 39:23.444
-Okay.
-You're pregnant, and I am not a monster.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.739
-You relieved?
-Yes.

39:28.074 --> 39:32.828
I mean, I don't wanna be a downer,
but it's kind of chilly out here.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.039
You've been a good sport.

39:35.122 --> 39:38.167
-Yeah, well, the hot chocolate is helping.
-Good.

39:39.126 --> 39:41.545
-That was the intention.
-Mm.

39:43.589 --> 39:47.551
Anyway, I've been rabbiting on
about my day. How did yours end up?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.346
Oh, it was fine.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.973
Did you talk to Cameron?

39:54.725 --> 39:55.851
Um...

39:55.935 --> 39:59.021
-You said he wasn't returning your texts.
-Right.

40:00.064 --> 40:04.026
Right. Yeah, no, he, I guess,
forgot to press send.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.363
-Oh. So it was nothing?
-Yeah.

40:10.866 --> 40:15.454
-You cold? You want my blanket?
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.165
I might get a refill.

40:19.792 --> 40:24.213
-Do you want one?
-Uh, no, I should be-- I'm-- I'm good.

40:24.296 --> 40:25.131
-Thanks.
-Okay.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.076
Oh, I love this song.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.954
Please don't say anything else.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.249
At least let me
get through the question this time.

41:04.044 --> 41:04.879
Okay.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.218
Mel, from the moment I...

41:12.970 --> 41:15.389
set eyes on you, I knew you were special.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.643
When I walked you home
from the bar that night

41:20.144 --> 41:23.731
to Hope's rickety old cabin,
I didn't wanna say good night.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.569
I didn't wanna leave your side.

41:28.652 --> 41:32.907
And as I've fallen
deeper and deeper in love with you...

41:34.783 --> 41:36.869
that feeling's only grown stronger.

41:38.454 --> 41:39.788
So if you will let me,

41:40.331 --> 41:44.043
I wanna spend the rest of my life making
you the happiest woman in the world.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.004
What I'm asking you is...

41:48.130 --> 41:48.964
Mel Monroe...

41:52.259 --> 41:53.135
will you marry me?
