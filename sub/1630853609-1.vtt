WEBVTT

00:29.279 --> 00:30.906
Awful weather today, huh?

00:31.698 --> 00:32.698
Hideous.

00:33.242 --> 00:36.787
Can we turn the sun down, like, 20%

00:36.870 --> 00:38.497
and get rid of the dolphins too?

00:38.580 --> 00:39.873
Way too cute.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.960
Happy birthday, baby.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.253
Thank you.

00:46.088 --> 00:49.508
So, what do you think of your new boat?

00:49.591 --> 00:50.843
Good present?

00:51.718 --> 00:54.096
I'll tell you
when I actually step foot on it.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.409
Oh, my God. There she is!

01:15.492 --> 01:19.746
I can't believe you're turning 45.
You look incredible.

01:19.830 --> 01:23.709
On the scale of ageless Jennifers,
you went from Aniston to Lopez.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.669
You're the sweetest.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.173
Now, I told Nicholas to fill this thing
with all your favorite stuff

01:29.256 --> 01:30.174
no matter the cost.

01:30.841 --> 01:31.967
Which was a lot.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.512
Let me show you around.
This is the third deck bar.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.056
We've got
a beautiful Meneghini refrigerator,

01:38.140 --> 01:39.892
some handblown crystal stemware,

01:39.975 --> 01:44.938
and heated stools
for the most important butt in my life.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.024
You know what we should get in here?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.901
A full-time crepe chef.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.611
-Love it. Genius. I'll get on it.
-Right?

01:50.694 --> 01:51.945
And he could live on the boat.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.780
I'll find one
that's going through a divorce.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.449
John, what do you think?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.784
Love crepes.

01:59.328 --> 02:05.083
And as you can probably tell, this is
the smallest pool on the entire ship.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.461
I'm actually a little embarrassed
to have to show it to you.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.255
No, it's cute.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.425
You know
who this pool will be perfect for?

02:13.509 --> 02:14.635
The dogs.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.930
Sweetie, do you think Mary-Kate
and Ashley would like this pool?

02:18.764 --> 02:20.474
Yeah, looks great.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.768
Seriously, are you even listening?

02:23.894 --> 02:27.606
Yeah. Sorry,
I'm just getting slammed here.

02:27.689 --> 02:31.485
Okay, but it would be nice
to get your input at some point.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.863
You want my input?

02:36.573 --> 02:37.574
Well, let's see.

02:38.408 --> 02:44.164
What I would really love to see would be
whatever you wanna see.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.333
This is your birthday gift.

02:46.416 --> 02:50.212
I want it to be special
and perfect for you.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.550
You fucking kidding me?

02:54.633 --> 02:55.884
I am so sorry, guys.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.470
I have to go meet with Hailey.
It's an emergency.

02:58.554 --> 02:59.972
They're sending the chopper.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.099
Why don't you two just stay here?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.518
You drink some champagne
and keep poking around.

03:04.601 --> 03:08.647
Whatever you want, consider it donezo.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.399
-Okay?
-Okay.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.818
See you at the party.

03:38.510 --> 03:42.055
It looks amazing, guys. Thank you so much.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.335
Oh, my God, you guys made it!
And I can't wait to catch up with you.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.212
Hey, how you guys doing?

04:13.295 --> 04:17.298
Hi. Don't forget to tell me
about Denmark, okay? Hi.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.759
Molly's birthday!

04:18.841 --> 04:22.012
Hey, come find me later.
I'll give you a tour, okay?

04:23.847 --> 04:28.435
Do you guys mind if I borrow
this particular beautiful woman right here

04:28.519 --> 04:29.603
for a few minutes?

04:30.354 --> 04:31.355
All right.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.944
Hey, I am so sorry
that I jetted off this morning.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.654
Did you enjoy the rest of the boat?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.405
How about this party, huh?

04:40.489 --> 04:42.574
I mean, this is quite a birthday, right?

04:42.658 --> 04:47.079
The boat is amazing.
The party is incredible.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.332
There was just one other thing
I thought could be nice.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.834
What is it?

04:51.917 --> 04:57.422
What if we had dinner alone?
Just the two of us.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.383
That's a great idea.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.801
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.010
Tomorrow night?

05:02.094 --> 05:03.178
I can even cook.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.474
Spaghetti, microwave burrito,
the options are endless.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.017
That sounds amazing.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.603
You-- No, shit.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.939
I actually-- I have to go to Sweden.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.357
That's tomorrow?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.693
-Yeah.
-Well, what if I come with you?

05:17.776 --> 05:20.612
Oh, no. You don't wanna do that.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.447
It's just-- It's gonna be so boring.

05:22.531 --> 05:27.244
It's, like, endless meetings about finance
and international tax law and… you know?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.580
Well, I can hang with that stuff.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.665
Seriously, let's do it.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.877
I will swing by Ikea in the morning,
learn some Swedish, and then we can go.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.921
Okay.
Get a love seat, maybe some meatballs?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.006
Sure.

05:40.632 --> 05:44.136
Hey. Where's this all coming from?

05:45.470 --> 05:46.471
I don't know.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.726
Remember back at the beginning?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.395
We used to do everything together.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.357
You'd stay up all night
in the garage coding,

05:57.441 --> 06:00.485
and I would call back
all our angry customers.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.821
Pay the bills you forgot about.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.617
We were kinda like partners.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.369
Well, we still are partners.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.664
I'm only in Sweden for a couple weeks
and then Prague.

06:12.748 --> 06:15.876
Then I'm back here,
and we can go have that dinner.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.878
Just you and me, okay?

06:20.214 --> 06:21.215
Okay.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.304
You got a spot on your tie.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.098
I'll go get you a new one, okay?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.100
Always looking out for me. I love it.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.061
-Thank you, hon.
-Course.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.616
Hailey?

06:47.699 --> 06:50.327
Molly. Hey.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.704
What are you doing in here?

06:54.122 --> 06:56.291
I just noticed that John
had something on his tie,

06:56.375 --> 06:59.294
so I was bringing him a new one.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.214
How do you know where his ties are?

07:06.301 --> 07:07.886
He told me he was gonna talk to you.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.017
Thank you so much, everybody,

07:14.101 --> 07:16.687
for being here with us
on this special day.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.315
And by the way,
the cash bar opens at 7:00…

07:20.399 --> 07:22.651
okay? No, I'm just kidding.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.696
Drinks are on me.
I own four soccer teams.

07:25.779 --> 07:31.326
Listen, our good friend Seal is here
to sing a birthday song to Molly.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.995
Seal, why don't you come on up here?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.079
Hailey?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.541
In our house? In our bedroom?

07:38.584 --> 07:40.210
Molly, you know what? I can explain.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.838
She's a fucking child.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.173
What is wrong with you?

07:44.256 --> 07:47.342
Was she even born
when we graduated college?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.845
Actually, she was one.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.222
Very cool.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.434
Was this going on
when we renewed our vows in the Bahamas?

07:56.018 --> 07:57.186
The new ring?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.229
Michael Bolton singing to me?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.356
-Michael Bolton?
-Shut up, Seal!

08:02.107 --> 08:03.525
Molly, how about we talk in private?

08:03.609 --> 08:07.738
I have been by your side for 20 years!

08:07.821 --> 08:11.033
I had sex with you
when you had your weird body…

08:11.116 --> 08:13.660
-Okay.
-…before you fixed it with money.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.788
I want a divorce.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.958
Don't ever speak to me again!

08:21.543 --> 08:22.961
Okay. Don't worry, everybody,

08:23.045 --> 08:25.130
everything's gonna be fine.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.173
Molly.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.716
-Fuck you!
-Molly.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.602
Molly, please, just let me explain.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.063
Shut the fuck up!

08:43.941 --> 08:45.442
-Goddamn it!
-Honey…

08:46.193 --> 08:48.529
Just come back inside. We'll talk.

08:51.615 --> 08:55.077
Bartosz, this is a stick.
How do you use a clutch?

08:55.661 --> 08:58.622
It's hard to describe.
It's more of a feeling.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.333
You know what? Fuck it.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.561
Goddamn it, Bartosz.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.794
Lawyers today announce the official
dissolution of the marriage

09:45.878 --> 09:48.797
of tech CEO John Novak and his wife

09:48.881 --> 09:51.425
eight months after accusations
of infidelity.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.135
Without a prenuptial agreement,

09:53.218 --> 09:57.181
Molly Novak's net worth is now
$87 billion,

09:57.264 --> 10:00.225
making her the third-wealthiest woman
in the country.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.936
Trading some man for 90 bill.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.105
I'd take it. That's a lot of shoes, honey.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.316
Let's not diminish
what she's gone through.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.276
I don't care how much she's got.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.653
Money alone can't buy you happiness.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.030
-Well, it helps.
-It helps.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.741
-Am I right? It helps.
-Maybe a little, just a little.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.743
-Helps a lot.
-Stop it.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.335
I feel so happy!

10:26.418 --> 10:27.586
That's the drugs!

10:29.004 --> 10:31.340
I see why they're so popular!

10:41.767 --> 10:43.644
I think I wanna dye my hair.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.729
-I love that.
-Right?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.486
Oh, my God, it's Sting.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.279
I'm gonna go say hi.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.615
-You do that. I'll get us more drinks.
-'Kay.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.283
Sting!

10:59.284 --> 11:00.744
Hey, Sting. What's up?

11:01.662 --> 11:03.205
I'm actually not Sting.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.665
Sting, it's okay.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.584
Molly Novak. You might have seen me on TV.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.669
Eighty-seven billion.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.755
I do recognize you,
but I'm just a waiter here.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.717
I like that you're role-playing
as a waiter tonight, Sting.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.344
You're so funny.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.055
We have the same hair color now.
Let's get a photo.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.182
-Oh, my God.
-Say "Sting."

11:22.266 --> 11:23.976
-Sting.
-Oh, my God. Look at us.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.061
-Wait, I need a better angle. Hold on.
-How's that?

11:26.144 --> 11:28.146
-Is that better?
-Just hold on to me. Sting!

11:30.482 --> 11:31.817
Fuck!

11:45.622 --> 11:47.165
Got some dinner ready for you.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.294
You okay?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.807
Why did this happen to me?

12:05.726 --> 12:08.520
Is it because
I didn't get preventative Botox?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.606
Don't be crazy, okay?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.400
You look beautiful. You're a goddess.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.403
You have the best skin
of any human being alive.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.448
You should be having sex
with all three members of Migos.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.994
I don't know who that is, but thank you.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.169
I've been playing it
over and over in my head.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.757
And I just keep thinking,
"Should I have done things differently?

12:39.092 --> 12:43.180
Or was I always meant to lose out
to a 25-year-old vagina?"

12:43.263 --> 12:46.558
Stop. Don't blame yourself.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.895
It's straight guys. They're idiots.

12:49.978 --> 12:53.815
There's an entire channel
devoted to fishing because of them.

12:55.526 --> 13:01.156
I just-- You always hear about
stuff like this happening.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.993
You never think it's gonna happen to you.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.442
-Hello?
-Molly Novak?

14:21.987 --> 14:23.197
Yeah, this is she.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.406
This is Sofia Salinas.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.658
I'm the executive director
of your foundation.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.371
-My what?
-Your charity foundation.

14:31.455 --> 14:34.082
You and your husband started it
seven years ago.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.252
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
coming into the office tomorrow.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.713
I have an office?

14:39.796 --> 14:42.382
Yes. It's a fairly important conversation.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.384
I would love to have it in person.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.054
Okay, sure.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.805
Great. How's 9:00 a.m.?

14:51.517 --> 14:52.893
Can we say 11:00?

14:53.644 --> 14:55.020
You have something at 9:00?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.231
Yes, I'll be asleep.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.442
I really would prefer 9:00.
Thank you very much, Miss Novak.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.737
Okay, thank you--
No, you know what? Can we say 10:00?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.030
She hung up.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.088
No. That can't be who I think it is.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.257
Cousin Molly, come in here, girl!

15:24.258 --> 15:25.259
Give me a hug.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.469
It's so good to see you!

15:27.553 --> 15:28.720
Hi, there.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.014
Howard?

15:31.098 --> 15:34.309
My Aunt Patty is your mom's cousin?
Little Wee-wee.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.228
Of course!

15:36.770 --> 15:38.730
Howard! Little Wee-wee.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.399
It's been a long time!

15:40.899 --> 15:43.485
-I'm guessing we got you a job here.
-Damn straight you did.

15:43.569 --> 15:46.238
I used to work
at this comic book store/vape shop,

15:46.321 --> 15:48.490
but now I run the computers here
or whatever.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.534
Come on. Let me show you around.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.994
-Great.
-Come. Follow me.

15:52.578 --> 15:53.871
So, the kitchen's down there.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.789
And you better get here early
if you want a muffin.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.000
-Okay.
-My desk is right here.

15:58.083 --> 16:02.504
And this is Arthur,
my boring, white cubicle mate.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.048
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.467
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm the accountant here.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.220
We probably need one of those.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.555
-If you say so.
-Great.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.850
Sorry. I don't mean to stare.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.436
It's just wild seeing you in person.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.105
I'm not used to meeting celebrities, so…

16:20.189 --> 16:23.233
Oh, no. I'm not a celebrity.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.484
Oh, yes, you are.

16:24.568 --> 16:27.321
You're like the most famous
cheated-on woman on the planet.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.283
And I need you to know,
Black Twitter has your back.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.827
That's nice.

16:33.911 --> 16:35.871
White Facebook is also very supportive.

16:36.371 --> 16:40.292
Sorry, that sounds like
I'm on white supremacy groups. I'm not.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.378
My aunt does send me some pretty bad stuff
that's very troubling--

16:43.462 --> 16:45.672
You know what? I'm gonna cut it off there.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.592
-You know, I have to run to a meeting.
-Yes. That sounds great.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.098
Knock, knock. Hi.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.978
-Hello. Sofia Salinas.
-Hi. Molly. So nice to meet you.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.439
-Thank you for coming in.
-Yeah.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.983
That's my name.
What are they thanking me for?

17:06.568 --> 17:10.321
I'm really proud of that after-school
program we funded for at-risk kids.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.741
What are they at risk for?
Being too damn cute?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.034
No, gang violence.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.494
Right.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.790
Well, you guys do
a lot of stuff like this, huh?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.666
Yes. We funnel your money

17:21.750 --> 17:23.752
to different charities
in Southern California,

17:23.836 --> 17:26.421
give them the resources they need
to do good work,

17:26.505 --> 17:28.382
and try to draw attention
to people in need.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.969
Well, those two look really messed up.
I hope we help them.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.220
Those are my grandparents.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.055
And they're beautiful.

17:35.889 --> 17:39.184
So, tomorrow we have
a ribbon-cutting ceremony

17:39.268 --> 17:42.229
for a new shelter downtown
that we've been working on for years.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.648
And that's actually the reason
I called you in today.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.735
To remind you that your behavior
does reflect on us as an organization,

17:48.819 --> 17:50.320
which makes our job harder.

17:51.196 --> 17:56.827
And what, exactly,
do you mean by my "behavior"?

17:58.245 --> 18:01.290
Look, I'm not trying to shame
a girl for having a good time,

18:01.373 --> 18:03.667
especially after what happened.
You do you.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.086
But you can't go traveling
around the world,

18:06.170 --> 18:09.464
getting on the news for falling
into swimming pools.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.301
Lots of people fall into swimming pools
all the time.

18:12.384 --> 18:15.179
Yeah, but they don't then get out
and try to give the waiter a lap dance.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.515
In my defense,
I really did think it was Sting.

18:18.599 --> 18:21.268
They have the same hairline
when you're on drugs.

18:21.351 --> 18:25.063
Okay, look. Our reputation here
is very important to me

18:25.147 --> 18:27.024
because lives are literally at stake.

18:29.026 --> 18:31.403
Wow, you really take this seriously,
don't you?

18:32.404 --> 18:35.240
Yeah, well, I kinda spent
my whole life doing it. So, yes.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.242
I admire that.

18:37.743 --> 18:41.038
And you won't have any more problems
from me.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.666
-That's all in the past. So…
-Okay.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.585
-It was great to meet you. And thank you…
-Of course.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.837
-…for all that you do.
-Thank you.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.145
Tonight, for your first course,

19:47.229 --> 19:50.899
I've made foie gras
with lychee, pine nut, and Riesling gelée.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.067
Thank you, David Chang.

19:52.150 --> 19:56.196
Hey, this is a weird question,
but you're a successful guy.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.741
Do you do any sort of charity work
or anything like that?

19:59.825 --> 20:02.202
Yeah, I work with a few charities
in the food space.

20:02.286 --> 20:05.247
See, that makes sense.
That's something you're passionate about.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.542
Yeah, it's tough to find the time,
with all my restaurants

20:08.625 --> 20:11.628
and my product lines and my job here.

20:11.712 --> 20:12.713
But it's good for the soul.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.175
Yeah, I get that.

20:20.596 --> 20:23.599
Wow. That's amazing.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.393
But you know
what I could really go for?

20:26.476 --> 20:28.312
A microwave bean and cheese burrito.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.274
I'll go heat that up for you.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.817
With Pringles on the side.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.611
Thanks, David Chang!

20:43.285 --> 20:44.703
What in the hell?

20:46.580 --> 20:49.208
Hi, there! I decided to come.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.001
What are all these cars for?

20:51.084 --> 20:53.295
So we can go
to the ribbon-cutting in style.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.923
Okay. We talked about optics yesterday,

20:56.006 --> 20:59.593
and I don't think it's a good idea to
show up to a shelter for unhoused people

20:59.676 --> 21:01.887
in a fleet of $100,000 SUVs

21:01.970 --> 21:04.139
that are absolutely terrible
for the environment.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.433
Good call.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.769
All right, let me fix this.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.315
And… sent.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.317
-Okay, we're good. Get in.
-What did you just do?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.487
I gave $10,000 to Greenpeace.
That should even it out, right?

21:18.570 --> 21:21.365
What? No.
That's not how this works.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.533
Let's roll!

21:24.409 --> 21:25.494
Holy shit.

21:27.829 --> 21:28.956
You ride with her.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.209
Wow, look at this.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.378
Individual temperature controls.

21:35.629 --> 21:38.674
That's pretty great.
You can be 71, and I can be 68.

21:39.675 --> 21:41.134
What a dream that is, right?

21:42.511 --> 21:43.595
Yeah, it's good.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.644
Thank you again or getting us these cars.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.981
Please, it's the least I could do
for our team.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.901
You've been with us for--

21:57.985 --> 21:59.653
Twenty-eight years.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.322
No, I'm just kidding.
It's just been a few years.

22:02.865 --> 22:04.157
I was at a big firm before.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.576
And then after my divorce,

22:05.659 --> 22:09.121
I wanted better hours
to spend more time with my daughter.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.998
-That's really sweet.
-Yeah.

22:11.081 --> 22:13.333
I bet you're her hero now.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.085
No, not at all. She hates me.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.005
Her new nickname for me
is Mitt Romney.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.590
-What?
-I know.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.176
It's extremely offensive.
I'm very liberal.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.094
I follow the Squad on Facebook.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.306
Right? So, that's something.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.601
Well, I mean,
maybe she's just going through a phase.

22:30.684 --> 22:33.854
You know,
she could still be processing the divorce.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.647
Yes. No, you're right.

22:35.731 --> 22:37.774
It took me a few years to recover myself.

22:39.193 --> 22:41.111
Yeah, I went to a pretty dark place.

22:41.195 --> 22:45.282
-I bought a djembe, and I took lessons.
-Oh, Jesus.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.909
It's like a big bongo drum.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.202
-That's what that is?
-Yeah.

22:48.285 --> 22:51.288
Wow. I guess I'm doing really good
in comparison.

22:53.207 --> 22:56.627
Well, it took me a while,
but I finally realized

22:56.710 --> 22:58.754
I couldn't control my ex-wife's behavior.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.215
I could only control how I respond to it.

23:07.137 --> 23:10.766
Well, I'll tell you what I can control.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.602
The temperature in this car.

23:14.311 --> 23:18.273
And Mama's goin' down to 66.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.943
-Are you with me, Mitt?
-I-- Wow.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.778
We have a wild one on our hands.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.113
-Yes, take me with you.
-Let's do it.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.827
Wow. I can't believe
there are so many people here.

23:31.662 --> 23:34.248
Yeah, I had Nicholas float
that I was coming down.

23:34.790 --> 23:35.999
I mean, people are going to follow me

23:36.083 --> 23:37.125
no matter where I'm going,

23:37.209 --> 23:39.378
so I figured I might as well use it
to help you guys out.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.923
That's actually not a bad idea. Thank you.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.299
No problem.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.052
Okay, I'm ready for my speech.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.762
Wait, you're not scheduled to do a speech.

23:48.846 --> 23:51.098
What is up, Los Angeles?

23:52.683 --> 23:53.684
Hi.

23:56.228 --> 24:01.233
Thank you.
We are so proud to open up this shelter.

24:01.984 --> 24:03.443
It took a lot of hard work

24:03.527 --> 24:07.114
from a lot of dedicated
and wonderful people.

24:07.698 --> 24:09.908
And I just want to applaud them

24:09.992 --> 24:12.661
and all the brave women
who are here with us today, so…

24:14.454 --> 24:16.373
Yes! You guys!

24:19.084 --> 24:21.128
What defines a home really?

24:21.712 --> 24:24.464
Is it just four walls and a roof?

24:25.382 --> 24:27.092
Or is it something more than that?

24:28.427 --> 24:32.598
I can tell you that for me,
home is where my wine fridge is.

24:33.724 --> 24:36.894
Now, I've personally never been unhoused,

24:36.977 --> 24:38.896
but there was one summer

24:38.979 --> 24:42.232
where they were doing construction
on our New York home,

24:42.316 --> 24:44.526
and I had to stay at The Plaza.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.988
At the end of those three weeks, I felt
like I was getting out of Shawshank.

24:49.406 --> 24:53.202
Now, the shelter will offer
physical and mental wellness checks.

24:53.285 --> 24:55.579
And I'll give you the diagnosis right now.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.498
You're batshit crazy if you don't
take advantage of that.

25:01.210 --> 25:04.922
But if you are crazy, we're here for you.

25:06.548 --> 25:12.179
Now, before we officially open things,
I have a little surprise for everyone.

25:13.180 --> 25:19.436
So last night I decided to personally
curate a grab bag of absolutely essential,

25:19.520 --> 25:23.941
must-have items
that I think no woman can live without.

25:24.024 --> 25:26.193
So, go ahead and open your bags.

25:26.276 --> 25:29.530
Everybody, please enjoy,
and thank you so much for coming.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.284
God, we are so fucked.

25:34.368 --> 25:37.746
A disaster at a charity ribbon-cutting
earlier today.

25:37.829 --> 25:40.916
Billionaire Molly Novak gave out
luxury gift bags

25:40.999 --> 25:43.585
while delivering a rambling,
incoherent speech

25:43.669 --> 25:47.422
that many are calling out of touch
and extremely offensive.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.591
All the sheltered ladies
All the sheltered ladies

25:49.675 --> 25:51.426
All the sheltered ladies
All the sheltered ladies

25:53.679 --> 25:55.848
Critics say this is
an embarrassing black eye

25:55.931 --> 25:59.309
for the charity led by the country's
newly minted third-richest woman.

26:00.352 --> 26:01.562
Please.

26:01.645 --> 26:05.274
They're overreacting.
This coverage is so skewed.

26:05.858 --> 26:07.276
You're being treated unfairly.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.735
I mean, these candles are dope.

26:08.819 --> 26:11.321
This whole room smells
like clean white women.

26:11.405 --> 26:14.032
Excuse me, Molly.
Can I speak with you in my office?

26:14.783 --> 26:15.868
Yes, of course.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.621
I'm sensing you're a little mad,

26:19.705 --> 26:21.498
but there's actually
some incense in the bag

26:21.582 --> 26:22.875
that will really help with that.

26:22.958 --> 26:26.628
You know what? I'm gonna ask you
something politely right now.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.590
Find something else.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.967
Start a handbag line. Join a book club.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.511
Go to space. Anything.

26:34.595 --> 26:38.390
Okay, maybe I didn't nail it
on what I put in the bags,

26:38.473 --> 26:40.350
but my heart was in the right place.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.102
You're not taking this seriously.

26:42.853 --> 26:43.854
And let's be honest,

26:43.937 --> 26:45.856
you only showed up today
because you got divorced.

26:45.939 --> 26:49.234
So you have this hole inside of you,
and you're trying to fill it.

26:57.075 --> 26:58.243
You're not totally wrong.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.080
There is a hole inside of me.

27:02.998 --> 27:05.751
But I think…

27:07.628 --> 27:11.757
it's been there for a long time,
since way before the divorce.

27:14.343 --> 27:18.847
I just got swept up in my husband's life.

27:19.765 --> 27:23.477
Everything was him, him, him, and…

27:29.650 --> 27:34.363
I never did the work to find out who I am

27:35.822 --> 27:39.326
or who I am supposed to be.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.163
But I'm doing that now.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.166
And…

27:49.044 --> 27:50.712
it's really, really scary.

27:55.801 --> 27:58.470
I'm sorry.
I don't really care about any of that.

27:58.554 --> 28:00.013
Wow. When I said that to Oprah,

28:00.097 --> 28:02.891
she gave me
one of the biggest hugs of my life.

28:02.975 --> 28:05.185
You know what?
You have your trauma, and I respect that,

28:05.269 --> 28:07.312
but I'm not here to be your therapist.

28:07.396 --> 28:09.356
We're here to help
as many people as we can

28:09.439 --> 28:11.441
in the short time we have on this earth.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.318
That's all I care about.

28:13.402 --> 28:14.820
We're on the same team here.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.865
All I wanna do is keep coming in.
That's it.

28:18.824 --> 28:21.493
I'm totally committed.
I won't let you down.

28:25.998 --> 28:26.999
Fine.

28:29.543 --> 28:32.379
And now that I think about it,
was there any world
