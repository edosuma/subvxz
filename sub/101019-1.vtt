ANNOUNCER:
Last season, on Love, Victor...

00:02.920 --> 00:05.255
ARMANDO: This is it, Salazars.
Our beautiful new home.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.340
VICTOR:
Dear Simon,

00:06.340 --> 00:09.510
you don't know me, but today
was my first day at Creekwood High.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.262
[bell rings]
I thought I'd finally get the chance
to be myself.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.764
To figure out who I really am.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.391
‐ Today, you paint the brush strokes
that define who you want to be.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.352
‐ Hey, new kid.
‐ Easy, Lake.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.270
‐ Is there a girl back home, or...?

00:20.270 --> 00:23.982
VICTOR: But my first day
didn't go exactly as planned.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.652
‐ Nope. No girl back in Texas.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.279
‐ Got it.
‐ You just made Mia Brooks blush.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.989
VICTOR: I ended up
connecting with this girl Mia,

00:30.989 --> 00:33.825
and she's great.
Sexuality's a spectrum. Right?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.953
FELIX: You think you can put in
a good word with Lake?

00:35.953 --> 00:36.995
I kind of have a thing for her.

00:36.995 --> 00:40.082
You deserve a guy
who would sacrifice everything.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.543
VICTOR: While my friend Felix
started a romance of his own...

00:42.543 --> 00:44.920
LAKE: You're my sexy little secret.
‐ A forbidden romance.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.172
ANDREW: How come we never talked about
what happened between us?

00:47.172 --> 00:49.174
‐ 'Cause there's nothing to talk about.
It was a mistake.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.926
VICTOR:
Things with my family were messy.

00:50.926 --> 00:51.969
PILAR:
This is why we moved?

00:51.969 --> 00:54.638
Because you did whatever
the hell you did with Dad's boss?

00:54.638 --> 00:57.057
VICTOR: Which made it harder
for me to deal with my own stuff.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.308
‐ Everything okay?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.687
‐ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Benji.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.188
I like guys.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.940
FELIX:
This doesn't change anything between us,

01:04.940 --> 01:06.191
but telling Mia's gonna suck.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.277
VICTOR: I just want to give Mia
an amazing night at the dance,

01:08.277 --> 01:09.319
and then I'll tell her the truth tomorrow.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.573
‐ The truth is, Felix Weston
makes me happy.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.991
[crowd cheering, clapping]

01:13.991 --> 01:15.993
BENJI: I want to be with someone
who makes me feel like

01:15.993 --> 01:17.494
I can just be myself.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.787
That's how you make me feel.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.332
VICTOR: And then the most
amazing thing happened with Benji.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.126
But it broke Mia's heart.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.961
‐ All this time, was any of it real?

01:25.961 --> 01:27.713
PILAR: She found out, didn't she?

01:27.713 --> 01:30.465
‐ I've been going through something,
and I want to explain it to you.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.134
I have something I need
to tell you guys.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.093
ISABEL:
We're separating.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.553
After what we've been through this year,

01:34.553 --> 01:36.513
we just needed to take a breather.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.806
‐ I'm gonna change.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.100
‐ Wait. Victor,
what were you gonna tell us?

01:43.645 --> 01:44.813
‐ Nothing.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.616
No.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.743
Not nothing.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.705
Mom... Dad...

02:05.209 --> 02:06.335
I'm gay.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.523
‐ I love you.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.113
‐ Um...

02:36.240 --> 02:38.659
I'm sorry. I, I don't, um...

02:39.993 --> 02:41.537
But what about Mia?

02:43.372 --> 02:45.791
‐ Well, I, I, uh...
[clears throat]

02:45.791 --> 02:49.294
thought that if I could make it work
with any girl, um...

02:49.294 --> 02:50.462
it'd be Mia.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.715
But I was wrong.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.760
‐ And how do you...

02:58.011 --> 02:59.179
I mean...

03:00.597 --> 03:03.267
[exhales] When did you decide this?

03:03.267 --> 03:06.979
‐ I didn't decide it. I just... am it.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.528
Mom, could you please say something?

03:14.528 --> 03:18.949
‐ I think, um,
that we should get some rest.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.953
And we can talk about it tomorrow.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.794
‐ Um...

03:46.977 --> 03:48.228

VICTOR: Hey Simon,
happy last week of summer.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.236
I'd thought I'd give you
an end of summer update.

04:37.236 --> 04:40.030
Things are still pretty weird with my mom.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.949
I mean, she knows I'm gay.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.951
I even told her that Benji
is my boyfriend...

04:44.493 --> 04:46.912
Hey. Uh...

04:46.912 --> 04:49.039
Benji and I are hanging out with
Lake and Felix after work,

04:49.039 --> 04:50.958
so I, I won't be home till late.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.628

talk about any of it.

Things are a little bit better
with my dad. But still awkward.

So, I know it's not huge, but, uh, hey,

Huh? I mean, unless it's trash day,

'cause then, well,
a dumpster blocks the window.

about the separation,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.735
even though I know
he's totally bummed about it.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.071

05:21.071 --> 05:23.824
Hey. Tell the Benji‐meister I said, "Sup!"

we're a thing except our best friends.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.319
It's kind of been great that way.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.529

little summer bubble,

06:02.529 --> 06:05.532
and we have this totally perfect secret.

As for Mia,

06:29.556 --> 06:32.142
we haven't actually
talked since the dance.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.186
She took off the second school ended

06:34.186 --> 06:36.897

in North Carolina.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.027
This is not that kind of camp!

she doesn't hate me forever.

despite everything,

06:48.825 --> 06:51.828
this has kind of been
the best summer of my life.

Hey, so school starts Monday.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.677
We should probably talk about

before school starts.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.653
What are we thinking?

07:24.653 --> 07:26.864
There's a ten part docuseries

07:26.864 --> 07:28.782
about human trafficking,

07:28.782 --> 07:32.411

said it was grueling...
