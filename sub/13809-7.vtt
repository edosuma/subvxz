11:11.504 --> 11:12.421
{\an1}WHOO-HOO!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.006
YEAH!

11:14.090 --> 11:16.050
GIRLS CAN'T SURF, HUH?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.676
I LIKE YOUR SPUNK.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.765
{\an1}HEY, HOW ABOUT YOUR
OWN COLUMN IN OUR MAGAZINE?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.518
SORRY, GUYS,
MY ZINE COMES FIRST.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.895
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

11:29.855 --> 11:33.275
I, UM... JUST WANTED
TO SAY I'M SORRY.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.528
THANKS. HEY, FORGET
ABOUT <i> GNARLY SURF.</i>

11:35.611 --> 11:37.822
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR YOU
ON THE COVER OF MY ZINE.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.620
EVERYBODY, ON THREE,
SAY "CHEESE."

11:44.703 --> 11:46.205
ONE... TWO...

11:46.288 --> 11:47.957
(<i> giggling</i> )

11:48.040 --> 11:48.499
Sam:
THREE!

11:48.582 --> 11:49.291
(<i> shutter clicks</i> )

11:49.375 --> 11:51.752
All:
COWABUNGA!

12:00.553 --> 12:03.431
(<i> struggling groans</i> )

12:03.514 --> 12:05.558
WHEN DOES THAT VIDEO START?!

12:09.728 --> 12:12.565
OTTO, TWISTER BETTER GET
HERE SOON WITH HIS VIDEO

12:12.648 --> 12:13.482
{\an1}OR THERE'S GOING
TO BE A RIOT.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.318
{\an4}I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW COOL I AM.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.195
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

12:18.279 --> 12:22.116
{\an1}TITO'S IDEA-- POPCORN WITH
A PINEAPPLE JUICE GLAZE.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.659
PINE CORN.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.036
(<i> both spit loudly</i> )

12:26.120 --> 12:28.038
{\an8}TWISTER IS HERE
WITH THE GOODS.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.666
{\an8}YOU BETTER HURRY
AND ROLL THE TAPE,
TWIST.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.293
{\an8}MacKENZIE'S
GETTING ANTSY.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.795
THIS PARTY STINKS ON ICE.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.672
{\an1}THIS IS THE FIRST
MOVIE OF ME

12:36.755 --> 12:38.591
YOU'RE SHOWING
TO THE PUBLIC.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.300
{\an1}YOU SURE
I LOOK AWESOME?

12:39.383 --> 12:42.470
YOU'RE GOING
TO LOVE IT, DUDE.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.936
(<i> kids cheer</i> )

12:58.027 --> 12:59.445
OOH!

13:02.448 --> 13:07.703
(<i> kids exclaiming in awe</i> )

13:07.786 --> 13:10.164
{\an4}Boy:
YEAH, WAY
TO GO, OTTO!

13:15.669 --> 13:16.212
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

13:16.295 --> 13:18.589
SICK FLICK, TWISTERMUNDO.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.049
OTTO WAS AWESOME.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.177
{\an5}I WAS PARTICULARLY
STRUCK BY THE
ENERGETIC SOUNDTRACK.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.179
WAIT, WAIT, YOU HAVE
TO WATCH THE CREDITS.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.659
(<i> kids laugh hysterically</i> )

13:46.742 --> 13:52.164
WHAT DO YOU KNOW--
THAT <i> WAS</i> ENTERTAINING.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.542
{\an1}YOU GOT TO LAUGH ABOUT IT;
EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.543
YOU STINK!

13:55.626 --> 14:02.007
(<i> laughter continues</i> )

14:07.179 --> 14:10.432
MY REP AS KING OF
ROCKET BEACH IS IN SHREDS.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.601
NOW I GOT TO CREATE
A WHOLE MESS

14:12.685 --> 14:14.019
OF THE RADDEST MOVES
EVER SEEN.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.146
WHY?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.273
SQUID, YOU WERE THERE
LAST NIGHT.

14:17.356 --> 14:21.151
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO USE
THE SHOTS OF ME BEEFIN' IT.

14:21.235 --> 14:21.819
{\an1}CHILL OUT,
OTTO MAN.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.862
HE MADE YOU LOOK LIKE A HERO.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.948
THE CREDITS WERE JUST THERE
FOR FUN.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.075
THEY WEREN'T FUN FOR ME.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.369
WAS LAST NIGHT COOL
OR WHAT?

14:30.452 --> 14:31.537
COOL?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.956
{\an1}DO YOU KNOW HOW FOUL
YOU MADE ME LOOK?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.457
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:35.541 --> 14:37.918
LITTLE BROTHERS, WHO AM I?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.670
WHOA!

14:39.753 --> 14:43.090
(<i> laughing</i> )

14:43.173 --> 14:45.551
OTTO, YOU WERE HILARIOUS!

14:49.597 --> 14:50.889
I'M GOING TO DO A MOVE

14:50.973 --> 14:53.684
{\an1}THAT'LL MAKE EVERYONE FORGET
TWISTER'S LOUSY VIDEO.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.685
WON'T WORK.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.729
UNLESS THE MOVE IS
TO NEW JERSEY.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.523
GET A LOAD OF THIS.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.984
IT CAME TO ME
IN A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

15:05.904 --> 15:06.363
(<i> grunts</i> )

15:06.447 --> 15:08.949
YOU MADE ME INTO A JOKE.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.493
DUDE, I MADE YOU A STAR.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.996
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO MAKE ME A STAR.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.372
WHAT I NEED IS A NEW BEST BRO.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.167
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:19.126 --> 15:20.169
{\an1}SAMMY...

15:20.252 --> 15:21.670
HUH?

15:21.754 --> 15:25.132
I HEREBY PROMOTE YOU
FROM SQUID TO BEST BRO.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.634
HUH?

15:26.717 --> 15:27.926
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

15:28.010 --> 15:28.385
IT'LL BE GREAT.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.554
WE'LL SKATE TOGETHER

15:30.638 --> 15:31.680
SURF TOGETHER.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.725
YOU CAN EVEN HELP ME
COME UP WITH NEW MOVES.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.934
ME, HELP YOU?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.019
NOW, LET'S GO HAVE
SOME REAL FUN.

15:37.102 --> 15:41.023
{\an1}MAYBE WE SHOULD PICK UP
A FIRST AID KIT ON THE WAY.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.691
OTTO, WAIT.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.902
{\an1}WHAT'S HE RANKING
ON ME FOR?

15:44.985 --> 15:47.029
THE MOVIE WAS A HIT, RIGHT?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.031
NOT THE KIND OF HIT
HE WANTED, TWISTER.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.077
Otto:
SAMMY, COME ON.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.578
YOU GOT TO KEEP UP.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.705
{\an5}I'M LUCKY
TO BE STANDING UP.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.876
OKAY, IF MY BEST BRO WANTS
TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK

16:00.959 --> 16:04.088
I'M HAPPY TO GIVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTS.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.882
{\an1}MAYBE WE COULD DO SOMETHING
WE'RE BOTH GOOD AT.

16:06.965 --> 16:07.800
WE'RE JUST GETTING
WARMED UP.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.552
I THINK WE SHOULD
GO FIND TWISTER.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.012
NO WAY.

16:12.096 --> 16:12.971
YOU'RE MY BEST
BRO NOW, SAM.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.683
{\an5}LET'S NOT EVEN
TALK ABOUT THAT
DORKY MOVIE GUY.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.061
{\an1}LOOK, BEING EMBARRASSED
OR LOOKING SILLY

16:19.144 --> 16:19.895
IS NO BIG DEAL, OTTO.

16:19.978 --> 16:22.981
{\an1}BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.900
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO OTTO ROCKET.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.445
{\an4}BUT WEREN'T THINGS,
I DON'T KNOW,
A LITTLE MORE FUN

16:28.529 --> 16:30.406
{\an1}WHEN ALL OF US
HUNG OUT TOGETHER

16:30.489 --> 16:31.240
AND YOU IGNORED ME?

16:31.323 --> 16:33.742
HUH? WHAT?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.413
WHAT'S UP, TWISTER?

16:37.496 --> 16:38.580
I THOUGHT I'D SHOOT

16:38.664 --> 16:40.374
SKATEBOARD MOVES
FOR MY NEXT VIDEO

16:40.457 --> 16:41.917
BUT THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE
AS GOOD AS OTTO.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.462
YOU KNOW, THE ANCIENT
HAWAIIANS HAVE A SAYING:

16:45.546 --> 16:48.757
IF YOU'RE WALKING ON A BEACH
AND YOU STEP ON A CRAB

16:48.841 --> 16:49.675
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO

16:49.758 --> 16:52.761
YOU SHOULD GO BACK
AND APOLOGIZE.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.513
{\an5}AFTER ALL, THAT CRAB
COULD BE IN YOUR SOUP
LATER ON.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.808
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

16:57.891 --> 17:00.686
{\an1}LET ME SEE IF I CAN PUT IT
A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY.

17:00.769 --> 17:01.812
I REMEMBER BACK IN '73.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.897
<i>TITO AND I WERE DOWN</i>
<i>AT SURF DOGS</i>

17:04.982 --> 17:07.608
<i>GETTING FOOT-LONGS</i>
<i>WITH THE WORKS.</i>

17:07.693 --> 17:09.778
<i>TITO HAD THIS LITTLE SMEAR</i>
<i>OF RELISH ON HIS FACE</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:12.406
<i>AND I REACHED UP</i>
<i>TO WIPE IT OFF.</i>

17:12.489 --> 17:15.032
THANKS, BUB.

17:15.117 --> 17:20.748
(<i> all laughing</i> )

17:20.830 --> 17:25.752
<i>TITO SURFED AWAY FOR THREE DAYS</i>

17:25.836 --> 17:28.589
AND HE HASN'T HAD
A HOT DOG SINCE.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.551
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

17:32.634 --> 17:33.886
TWISTER, THE POINT IS

17:33.969 --> 17:36.555
{\an1}YOU CAN MAKE SOMEONE FEEL
BAD WITHOUT MEANING TO

17:36.638 --> 17:38.140
OR KNOWING YOU DID IT.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.349
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

17:39.433 --> 17:40.559
{\an1}YOU SHOULDN'T TRY
TO SET THINGS RIGHT.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.187
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.647
I SHOULD BRING OTTO A HOT DOG.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.483
NO, YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.109
OH...

17:55.073 --> 17:59.036
OTTO, I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT... NO, HOW ABOUT...

17:59.119 --> 18:01.789
OTTO, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY...

18:01.872 --> 18:02.956
(<i> squeals</i> )

18:03.040 --> 18:04.833
REG, MAN,
YOU SCARED ME.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.877
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.212
I NEED TO TALK
TO OTTO.

18:08.295 --> 18:08.670
IS HE AROUND?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.589
RIGHT OVER THERE.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.716
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS
HARDER TO WATCH--

18:12.800 --> 18:13.926
OTTO TRYING HIS NEW MOVE

18:14.009 --> 18:15.761
OR SAM TRYING
TO BE YOU.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.430
OH, DUDE, THAT WAS SICK.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.809
UH... MAJOR PROPS.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.814
(<i> squeals</i> )

18:26.897 --> 18:29.441
(<i> groans</i> )

18:29.525 --> 18:31.026
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.821
THE SHRIMP'S TRYING OUT
FOR THE SEQUEL.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.239
(<i> all laugh</i> )

18:37.533 --> 18:39.868
{\an1}MAN, THAT
BACK STABBER TWISTER

18:39.952 --> 18:42.120
{\an1}BETTER NOT SHOW
HIS FACE AROUND ME.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.750
{\an1}MAYBE THIS ISN'T
THE BEST TIME.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.419
{\an1}YOU GUYS HAVE GONE
AT IT BEFORE.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.629
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

18:50.712 --> 18:51.880
I LET HIM DOWN.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.092
NOW HE'LL NEVER
FORGIVE ME.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.510
UNLESS...

18:56.593 --> 18:57.845
YOU TALK TO HIM FOR ME.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.388
WAIT A SECOND.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.973
THIS IS BETWEEN
YOU GUYS.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.474
{\an1}PLEASE, REGGIE,
PLEASE.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.226
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.894
{\an1}TELL HIM
HOW SORRY I AM.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.313
YOU'RE BETTER WITH WORDS
AND SENTENCES AND STUFF.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.610
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.029
Otto:
GET ON THE "X."

19:16.113 --> 19:19.449
HAVE YOU EVER JUMPED
OVER ANYONE BEFORE?

19:19.533 --> 19:21.618
NO, BUT HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.245
TERRIFIC.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.913
{\an1}HEY, KID,
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.915
THERE'S GOING TO
BE A ROCKET WRECK

19:26.999 --> 19:28.333
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.628
(<i> all laugh</i> )

19:31.712 --> 19:32.087
SAMMY...

19:32.170 --> 19:33.755
STOP FLINCHING.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.716
TWISTER NEVER FLINCHED.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.259
<i>TWISTER WAS DOWN FOR ANYTHING.</i>

19:37.342 --> 19:40.429
<i>HE'D JUMP OVER STUFF,</i>
<i>TAKE ANY HILL.</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:42.347
BUT HE'S NOT MY BEST BRO ANYMORE

19:42.431 --> 19:43.932
AND YOU ARE.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.768
SO NO FLINCHING!

19:48.770 --> 19:49.563
OH.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.901
(<i> screams, then groans</i> )

19:54.610 --> 19:56.653
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.739
{\an1}SAM'S NOT SOME
STUNT DUMMY LIKE TWISTER.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.116
DON'T SAY THAT NAME AROUND ME.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.951
{\an1}SINCE YOU STOPPED
SPEAKING TO TWISTER

20:03.035 --> 20:04.286
YOUR CONCENTRATION BITES

20:04.369 --> 20:05.579
SAMMY'S ACTING
LIKE A NITWIT--

20:05.662 --> 20:06.788
NO OFFENSE, SAM...

20:06.872 --> 20:07.539
NONE TAKEN.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.625
AND WORST OF ALL,
THE REAL TWISTER

20:09.708 --> 20:10.459
{\an1}IS SPREADING BUMMAGE
LIKE THE FLU.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.461
SO WHAT?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.671
SO YOU SHOULD GET
OVER BEING ANGRY

20:14.755 --> 20:16.506
{\an1}AND GET BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS

20:16.590 --> 20:17.299
FOR ALL OF OUR SAKES.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.676
A BEST FRIEND SHOULD
BE THERE FOR YOU

20:19.760 --> 20:22.387
NOT MAKE YOU LOOK BAD.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.805
I GIVE UP.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.432
NICE KNOWING
YOU GUYS.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.767
REGGIE, WAIT.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.978
{\an1}I LIKE BEING OTTO'S BEST BRO,
BUT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.981
I THINK I KNOW A WAY, SAMMY.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.192
THANKS.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.200
{\an1}IF OTTO SEES ME,
HE'LL WRECK MY CAMERA

20:43.283 --> 20:45.118
AND THEN HE'LL WRECK ME.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.495
WE WON'T LET HIM
SEE YOU.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.580
COME ON, AND KEEP
THE CAMERA ROLLING.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.626
{\an5}Reggie:
HOW'S THE NEW MOVES COMING,
OTTO MAN?

20:52.709 --> 20:54.753
INSANE.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.712
RIGHT, BEST BRO?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.631
(<i> whimpers</i> )

20:57.714 --> 20:58.674
CAN YOU SHOW ME ONE?

20:58.757 --> 20:59.716
I'D LOVE TO SEE IT.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.678
NO, NOT AGAIN.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.012
SORRY, SIS,
IT'S A SECRET.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.349
WELL, IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT...

21:09.226 --> 21:11.353
BATTLE STATIONS, SAM.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.730
{\an3}OH, NO.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.703

21:46.805 --> 21:47.848
TO SPRING THEM
ON THE WORLD.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.017

21:50.100 --> 21:51.309
HUH?

21:51.393 --> 21:52.102

SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER MOVIE

22:32.225 --> 22:35.145

YOU'D GET SO TWEAKED.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.565
{\an1}WELL, MAYBE I GOT
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.486
