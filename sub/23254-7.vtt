00:26.240 --> 00:27.280
Hi, Dad.

00:32.479 --> 00:33.480
Oh, my God.

00:35.040 --> 00:35.960
Alyssa?

00:41.680 --> 00:43.520
<i> He smells exactly the same.</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:50.080
<i> I thought I should give Alyssa</i>
<i>and her dad some space.</i>

00:53.440 --> 00:54.320
He a poof?

00:54.920 --> 00:56.160
He's my boyfriend.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.240
Is that mine?

01:02.400 --> 01:03.240
Yeah. It suits you.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.600
Well, you turned out all right,
didn't you?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.880
-You're gorgeous!
-Shut up.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.520
No, no, I'm serious.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.800
You were a fucking weird-looking kid.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.800
I'm relieved.

01:18.840 --> 01:19.760
Smoke?

01:25.440 --> 01:26.480
How's your ma?

01:26.560 --> 01:27.760
Yeah, fine.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.480
Married to a total dick, but...

01:31.000 --> 01:31.840
fine.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.920
Can we stay with you for a bit?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.840
<i> Please say yes.</i>

01:40.320 --> 01:41.360
Course you can.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.360
You're my blood, girl.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.520
Cool. Thanks.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.040
So, you run away, then?

01:52.560 --> 01:53.640
From your ma's?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
You're my blood all right.

02:06.040 --> 02:06.920
We're in trouble.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.120
Pregnant?

02:10.280 --> 02:11.200
Worse.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.120
How much?

02:15.200 --> 02:16.320
A lot.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.240
<i> I will tell him what we've done.</i>

02:20.560 --> 02:21.560
<i>At some point.</i>

02:24.360 --> 02:25.920
We didn't know where else to go.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.760
Well, you're safe as houses here.

02:28.840 --> 02:29.680
OK?

02:29.760 --> 02:32.720
-You can stay as long as you want.
-Thanks.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.920
You OK, James?

02:39.840 --> 02:41.280
That becomes a bed.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.920
Oh, what, like a fold Cool.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.680
No. Just becomes a bed if you sleep on it.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.000
I'm through at the back there,
and the bathroom's in there.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.400
Ah, it's so good to see you, girl.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.240
Sleep tight.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.400
<i> He's all right.</i>

03:02.480 --> 03:04.720
<i>He's actually, genuinely all right.</i>

03:32.560 --> 03:34.360
<i> Leslie was pretty different.</i>

03:36.000 --> 03:36.920
James?

03:37.640 --> 03:38.480
Yeah?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.480
Do you want to throw knives?

03:42.480 --> 03:43.320
What?

03:45.920 --> 03:47.520
You never thrown a knife before?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.000
Uh, no.

03:50.520 --> 03:51.520
Take your shirt off.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.360
Uh, not bad.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.880
Beginner's luck.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.400
Yeah, right.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.760
You want a beer?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.800
Do you look after her, James?

05:01.440 --> 05:02.280
Yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Good.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.360
That's very good.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.200
Did she ever mention me?

05:12.320 --> 05:14.240
-Yeah.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.480
Does she...

05:18.400 --> 05:19.840
love me, do you think?

05:21.720 --> 05:22.560
Yeah.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.080
<i> I'd never met</i>
<i>someone like Leslie.</i>

05:31.520 --> 05:32.360
<i>Not an adult.</i>

05:32.880 --> 05:34.640
<i>He seemed like one, most of the time,</i>

05:35.320 --> 05:36.840
<i>but it was like he was...</i>

05:36.920 --> 05:38.320
<i>missing parts.</i>

05:45.480 --> 05:47.080
What's she done to her hair?

05:51.920 --> 05:52.760
Oh, God.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.080
As you can see,

05:58.160 --> 06:01.720
your children seem to have committed
another serious crime.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.440
She's not doing anything, is she?
It's him!

06:04.840 --> 06:06.160
He's the one with the fucking gun.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.080
Gwen!

06:07.160 --> 06:08.720
Do you know where James got a gun from?

06:08.800 --> 06:11.600
He never had a gun.
He only ever had his knife.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.520
What the hell is the matter with you?

06:34.720 --> 06:36.840
It's his birthday tomorrow. He'll be 18.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.080
18.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.480
Here, look.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.960
Look at him.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.680
She killed herself, his mum.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.200
She did it in front of him.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.080
Hope you like well done.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.720
Well done as in, like, fucking cremated.

07:17.960 --> 07:18.960
Dig in. Thanks, Dad.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.800
<i> I love saying that.</i>

07:26.200 --> 07:27.200
Slainte!

07:30.960 --> 07:33.880
-You should come out on me boat.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.560
Nothing flashy, a little cuddy cabin,
but she's cute.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.800
I'll take us out this afternoon,
if you want?

07:39.480 --> 07:40.320
Cool!

07:45.600 --> 07:47.280
I can't believe
my dad has a boat.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.560
Basically means that I've got a boat.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.560
Right, let's do it!
Leslie!

07:53.280 --> 07:54.320
Les!

07:55.040 --> 07:55.880
What?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.280
Did you not see the rota?
I stuck it on your fridge.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.480
Ah, for fuck's sake!

08:01.040 --> 08:01.880
Today?

08:01.960 --> 08:03.080
Like now?

08:04.520 --> 08:07.280
Can't you do it?
No. I got to take Dad to be bled.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.480
All right, change of plan.
We'll do the boat later, OK?

08:11.560 --> 08:12.480
Why?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.920
Um, I've just got to do a bit
of work from home.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.400
You just chill out here, OK?

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920
OK.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.200
<i> It would seem safe to assume</i>
<i>they're headed to Alyssa's father:</i>

08:25.280 --> 08:26.240
<i>Leslie Foley.</i>

08:26.320 --> 08:29.880
He's got previous, nothing major:
cautions and suspended.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.200
The local PCs, they checked him out
when we identified Alyssa,

08:33.280 --> 08:35.520
but he no longer lives
at his given address.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.520
She thinks he still does.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.800
So we move out there,
and we wait for them to show up.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.480
Good man.

08:43.559 --> 08:44.600
He's gonna take us.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.320
I know.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.360
-I think your dad's a drug dealer.
-Cool.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.480
-But--

08:57.600 --> 09:00.360
<i> It seemed like Alyssa</i>
<i>was deliberately missing the point.</i>

09:00.440 --> 09:03.160
Is this the best place for us to stay?

09:04.520 --> 09:05.880
We killed a guy.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.560
<i> No way am I leaving yet.</i>

09:07.640 --> 09:10.320
Stop worrying.
He's going to look after us.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.080
We're totally safe here.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.200
Hey, Alyssa, meet Jonno.
Hey.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.760
Check this out.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.040
Whoa!

09:22.120 --> 09:23.760
<i> We definitely weren't safe.</i>

09:24.800 --> 09:27.040
We must find them
before they do anything else.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.680
Or we could...

09:29.840 --> 09:31.840
let them carry on for a couple of days.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.080
-Well, he's 18 tomorrow.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.000
That's proper prison, that is.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.640
I'm joking.

09:41.720 --> 09:42.960
He's just a kid. No, he's not.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.120
Go easy on these.
They're rocket fuel.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.640
-Nothing.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.280
Well, they've got to get it from someone.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.200
It's completely ethical.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.680
That's the beauty of it.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.720
Everything's locally sourced, organic.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.040
No gang warfare bullshit,

10:17.120 --> 10:19.320
no women swallowing condoms,

10:19.400 --> 10:20.840
no kids getting hurt.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.160
This world, man.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.560
"Hey, kids, don't do drugs,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.040
but do nag your mum to buy you a phone

10:30.120 --> 10:33.160
hewn from the sweat and tears
of a modern slave."

10:35.240 --> 10:37.720
-Yeah.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.480
Gotta fight the system.
You got to, kiddo.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.040
Because we live
in properly fucked-up times.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.800
Don't you forget that.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.840
The wisest thing
anyone's ever said to me, right?

10:53.520 --> 10:54.640
Wanna hear this?

10:55.320 --> 10:57.840
-Yeah.

10:59.080 --> 11:04.920
"To be mad in a deranged world
is not madness. It's sanity."

11:06.680 --> 11:07.640
Who said that?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.120
Me.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.720
<i> He's basically Gandhi.</i>

11:12.520 --> 11:14.040
You are golden, you know that?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.920
Golden!

11:18.360 --> 11:19.760
<i> Leslie talked a lot.</i>

11:20.960 --> 11:22.480
Want one?

11:24.280 --> 11:25.160
Eunice?

11:25.360 --> 11:26.280
No, thanks.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.000
You know, Clive Koch
could well have been self-defense.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.200
Well, we don't have proof,
so you can't assume that.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.120
And you can't assume the opposite.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.840
I feel sorry for them, all right? I do.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.200
I think they're miserable,
fucked-up, stupid kids

11:46.280 --> 11:48.720
who've done something bad,
but we don't know why--

11:48.800 --> 11:50.080
I don't care why!

11:50.840 --> 11:52.840
I care that they don't kill someone else.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.760
Teri, I'm not--

11:53.840 --> 11:55.960
-We're not social services!
-That's not--

11:56.040 --> 11:59.160
What good does feeling sorry for them do?

11:59.960 --> 12:01.240
What does it actually do?

12:05.280 --> 12:06.680
We need to find them.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.880
We. Find. Them.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.880
With an armed response unit
that scares the shit out of them?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.800
So, what do you suggest?
We coax them out with a giant Toblerone

12:15.880 --> 12:17.360
and hope for the best?

12:21.920 --> 12:23.880
I'm still not convinced he was armed.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.320
Well, we're going
to have to behave like he was.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.240
Is this about something else?

12:35.320 --> 12:36.320
What?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.120
No!

12:38.640 --> 12:39.640
OK.

12:40.120 --> 12:40.960
Sorry.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.600
I just think someone should talk to them,
not wave a gun at them.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.560
Well, someone is very welcome
to talk to them

12:48.640 --> 12:50.200
as soon as they're locked up.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.080
Talk to them,

12:52.160 --> 12:54.240
&lrm;understand them, I don't know,

12:54.320 --> 12:56.200
teach them fucking whittling.
I don't care.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.280
So, what do you think of him?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.880
<i> Sometimes,</i>
<i>it was important to lie.</i>

13:10.760 --> 13:12.840
Yeah, he's all right.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.480
"All right?"

13:16.000 --> 13:17.360
All right, like good.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.000
You don't get it.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.560
Ah, right.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.760
Who's for a pint?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.040
Are we not going out on the boat?

13:24.120 --> 13:26.120
Ah, girl, I'm knackered.
Do you mind?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.880
I'll take you out tomorrow, I promise.

13:29.120 --> 13:29.960
OK. Cross my heart.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.360
OK.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.200

14:35.600 --> 14:36.720
I told you. No.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.640
And Leslie?

14:39.800 --> 14:40.920
No idea.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.360
He moved out months ago.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
Just in case.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.800
Maybe we shouldn't stay here too long.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.720
What?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.000
I just think that we should

16:01.560 --> 16:03.480
<i> Alyssa felt far away from me.</i>

16:05.320 --> 16:06.600
<i>It was like we'd gone back.</i>

16:06.680 --> 16:09.200
<i>♪ That's how I got to Memphis ♪</i>

16:10.840 --> 16:12.160
<i>♪ That's how I got to... ♪</i>

16:12.240 --> 16:14.840
I haven't seen you in ten years!

16:18.640 --> 16:20.920
Dad?
What is it

16:21.000 --> 16:24.480
I... I'm... I'm useless.
I'm fucking useless.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.560
Fuck...

16:26.320 --> 16:27.440
No, you're not!

16:28.040 --> 16:28.960
What?

16:31.320 --> 16:32.760
You're not useless.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.680
A card every year without fail.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.080
I think that's pretty good, Dad.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.600
<i>♪ ...tell her that I love her so ♪</i>

16:41.080 --> 16:42.760
It's all right.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.920
It's all right.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.760
<i> I'd started to think</i>
<i>that maybe I should just go.</i>

16:50.040 --> 16:51.680
<i>Leave Alyssa with her dad.</i>

16:51.880 --> 16:52.840
<i>She seemed happy.</i>

16:54.680 --> 16:56.120
I'm not even joking. Right?

16:56.200 --> 16:57.960
Shorts. That's it.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.040
The whole year round.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.120
He doesn't even own
a pair of trousers, do you, Jonno?

17:03.200 --> 17:04.040
No.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.440
What did you wear
to your ma's funeral?

17:07.440 --> 17:08.280
Black shorts.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.200
Black shorts!

17:11.280 --> 17:14.000
Black fucking shorts!
<i> But then everything changed.</i>

17:14.480 --> 17:15.880
Les. Les!

17:16.280 --> 17:18.320
-Oh, come on, Debbie, not now.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.920
-Yeah. Come over here.
-No, Debbie. Honestly, you should go home.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.760
Seriously.
We'll only end up rowing.

17:22.839 --> 17:23.960
You don't want that.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.520
Come here!

17:34.520 --> 17:37.760
She's a bit unstable, you know?
In the head.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.360
The Police are looking for her,
what's she done?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.440
<i> Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:45.360
Big deal.
Like you never did that.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.200
I need you to take an interest.
I can't do this on my own.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.960
It's just not fair.
OK, I'm listening.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.680
What do you need?
A new school uniform.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.000
Why?
<i> No, no...</i>

17:55.080 --> 17:57.320
...he's grown
and he looks like a prick!

17:57.400 --> 17:58.880
What do you want me to do?

17:59.200 --> 18:01.720
He's not gonna stop growing!
Give me money.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.640
Is he your dad?

18:04.920 --> 18:06.800
No. Look, Lyss, it's not like...

18:06.880 --> 18:08.800
-He's just--

18:10.200 --> 18:11.960
Ah, man, this is too much.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.440
This is like some kind of fucking ambush.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.360
I'm going home.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.320
Oi! No, you're not!

18:20.400 --> 18:22.120
Get fucking back here!

18:35.280 --> 18:37.440
Yeah, we'll get some sleep now.
OK. Night.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.480
So, the local team have set up
surveillance at his ex-girlfriend's.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.240
There's no sign of the kids yet.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.920
We'll go back over first thing.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.320
Um...

18:50.400 --> 18:52.280
Do you want to share a room?

18:53.880 --> 18:54.720
What?

18:56.040 --> 18:57.480
Save the taxpayer.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.960
No, I don't.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.480
Hiya. Two single rooms, please.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.960
His neck's broken.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.120
We have to kill it.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.200
Yeah.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.680
I can't do it.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.240
-No.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.920
