TO GET YOU LIKE I PROMISED.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.120
- SHE'S GONE.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.622
HARRIET--SHE'S NOT HERE.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.458
- DON'T PANIC.

00:41.541 --> 00:47.464
- BUT WE NEED HER
TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.631
- I FOUND SOMETHING.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.467
- WHAT IS IT?

00:50.550 --> 00:54.596
- WELL, FOR HER LUNCH ORDER,
SHE ORDERED FISH STICKS.

00:54.679 --> 00:55.722
- IS THAT IT?

00:55.805 --> 00:58.308
- IT COULD BE
SOME KIND OF CODE, RIGHT?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.852
- OH, THE FISH STICK CODE.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.980
- ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

01:04.063 --> 01:04.688

01:04.772 --> 01:07.817
- BUT WITHOUT HARRIET,

01:07.901 --> 01:09.319
HOW ARE WE GOING TO SAVE
MY GREAT-GRANDPA?

01:09.402 --> 01:12.781
HOW ARE WE GOING TO STOP HIM
FROM WAKING UP EVIL?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.575

01:21.873 --> 01:22.957
YOU ARE HER NEPHEW,

YOU KNOW,
GOOD OLD AUNT HARRIET.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.131

FROM HER THOUGHTS.

SHE KEPT REMINDING ME

02:06.501 --> 02:07.794
DON'T MENTION FABIAN.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.505
DON'T SAY SHE LOOKS LIKE AMBER."

YEP, I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON
WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT PLANS?

02:21.808 --> 02:24.936

02:32.235 --> 02:33.945
IT'S FOR PROSPECTIVE PARENTS,

02:34.028 --> 02:35.446
AND I PROMISED
A LIVE PERFORMANCE

02:35.530 --> 02:38.741
DEMONSTRATING OUR STUDENTS'
HIDDEN TALENTS.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
- YEAH, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.244
- YEAH, JOY, JOY, PLEASE.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.205
IF YOU COULD HELP ME OUT,
I'LL OWE YOU A BIG FAVOR.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.710
- IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD SAY THAT,

02:48.793 --> 02:50.086
BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING

02:50.169 --> 02:53.298
THAT I COULD REALLY, REALLY
USE YOUR HELP WITH.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.467
- WHY DO I SUDDENLY FEEL
I MIGHT REGRET THIS?

03:06.936 --> 03:09.272
- ALL RIGHT, SO,
HARRIET LEFT US THIS CARD.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.274
OKAY, IT TELLS US WHAT TO DO
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HER.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.650
- IT SAYS WE HAVE TO PERFORM
THE CEREMONY OURSELVES.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.320
- OURSELVES?

03:15.403 --> 03:17.447

TO WAKE ROBERT.

"YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE,
PURE OF HEART.

HE WILL AGAIN BE THE GREAT
MAN HE ONCE WAS."

WHAT WE'RE DOING.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.832
WHAT IF WE DO SOMETHING WRONG?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.459
IT COULD FINISH HIM.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.337
- SO WE RISK YOUR GREAT-GRANDPA
BEING WOKEN UP BY DENBY?

03:32.420 --> 03:32.795
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.422
- NO.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.548
- SHE'S RIGHT TO BE WORRIED.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.883
THESE CEREMONIES
HAVE TO BE CORRECT

03:36.966 --> 03:37.884
DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL.

03:37.967 --> 03:38.843
AND IF THEY'RE NOT--

03:38.927 --> 03:40.178
- EVERYTHING GOES KABLOOEY.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.471
INCLUDING US.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.432
- OKAY, WELL, THIS IS OUR
ONLY CHANCE NOW, OKAY?

03:44.515 --> 03:48.144
IF HARRIET WANTED US TO DO IT,
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE IN HER.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.145
- HARRIET DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
PLANET SHE WAS ON.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.688
- WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

03:50.772 --> 03:53.316
WE WAIT FOR VICTOR TO REALIZE
HE'S GOT A FAKE BRACELET?

04:01.574 --> 04:05.161
- DOES THIS LOOK
IN ANY WAY FAMILIAR?

04:14.170 --> 04:15.672
- THIS IS THE BRACELET
THEY GAVE ME.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.841
- THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN
LAST YEAR.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.511
SOME WORTHLESS TRINKET
BELONGING TO HER.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.388
- THE SAME INFERNAL CHILDREN
EVERY TIME.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.681
- COME, VICTOR.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.432
YOU CAN'T REALLY THINK
THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.892
- HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN IT?

04:27.976 --> 04:29.852
- YOU'RE THREATENING THEM
WITH ENDLESS SEARCHES.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.688
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT
GIVING YOU SOMETHING

04:31.771 --> 04:32.689
WAS BETTER THAN NOTHING.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.524
- THEY MUST KNOW.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.401
- I THINK WHAT VICTOR'S
TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

04:36.484 --> 04:38.695
HE SIMPLY CAN'T CONTROL
A FEW YOUNGSTERS.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.321
- YOU.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.783
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

04:43.866 --> 04:47.370
- WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT WE
ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME,

04:47.453 --> 04:50.707
AND WE MUST NOW STOP AT NOTHING
TO GET THE REAL BRACELET.

04:52.291 --> 04:56.004
- SO I'M LOOKING
FOR A PARTY PIECE,

04:56.087 --> 04:58.715
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT
THAT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT,

04:58.798 --> 05:00.049
LIKE SILENT JENNY.

05:00.133 --> 05:00.883
[no audio]

05:00.967 --> 05:03.511
BRILLIANT.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.470
WILLOW?

05:04.554 --> 05:07.140
YOU'RE CREATIVE, AREN'T YOU?

05:07.223 --> 05:10.476
- WELL, I AM SECRETLY
GOOD AT POETRY.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.230
- I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE ENERGETIC.

05:14.313 --> 05:17.817
- I CAN RECITE IT WITH
PASSION, FROM THE HEART.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.407
- CAN YOU DO IT
ON A UNICYCLE?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.742
- YES.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.704
WELL, I CAN DO IT
NEXT TO A UNICYCLE.

05:29.787 --> 05:30.747
- I CAN SING.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.914
- REALLY?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.416
- YOU DID SAY HIDDEN TALENT.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.128
I WROTE A VERY SPECIAL SONG
FOR A VERY SPECIAL SOMEONE.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.008
- ALFIE?

05:42.091 --> 05:43.259
YOU COULD DO SOME MAGIC?

05:43.342 --> 05:45.178
- YEAH, BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
HIDDEN TALENT.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.430
EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS
THAT I CAN DO MAGIC.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.016
- YEAH, BUT WE CAN JUST PRETEND,
CAN'T WE?

05:50.099 --> 05:51.100
- COME ON, GUYS.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.810
THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL
FOR THE SCHOOL.

05:52.894 --> 05:57.148
- WELL, HOW BIG A DEAL?

05:57.231 --> 05:58.149
LIKE, NO LESSONS?

05:58.232 --> 06:00.943
ALL STAFF ON DUTY,
EVEN VICTOR?

06:01.027 --> 06:02.945
- I GUESS THEY'RE ALL
EXPECTED TO ATTEND, YEAH.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.614
- SORRY I'M LATE, CLASS.

06:04.697 --> 06:08.659
I HAD A FAMILY MATTER
TO ATTEND TO.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.912
RIGHT, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.372
AND FROM YOU.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.875
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
OSIRIAN?

06:22.423 --> 06:23.966
- IT'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.344
WHEN ALL THE STAFF
ARE AT THE OPEN DAY--

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
- THEN WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TIME
IN THE GATEHOUSE.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.598
IT COULD WORK.

06:30.681 --> 06:31.599
- TOMORROW?
- YEAH.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.850
- NO, IT'S TOO SOON.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.644
I NEED MORE TIME
TO LOOK OVER THE INSTRUCTIONS.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.978
- FABIAN, BUDDY,

06:36.062 --> 06:37.772
YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT, LIKE,
A KAJILLION TIMES.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.273
- NO, LOOK.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.775
SOMETHING--SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING ME.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.318
I'VE OVERLOOKED SOMETHING.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.237
- MAYBE IT'S THE PROSPECT
OF TERRIBLE AND CERTAIN DOOM

06:44.320 --> 06:45.571
THAT'S WAITING FOR US UP THERE.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.948
JUST A GUESS.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.158
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD, ALL RIGHT?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.369
WE JUST HAVE TO HOLD ONTO
THE BRACELET UNTIL TOMORROW,

06:51.452 --> 06:52.870
AND THEN WE GO OVER AND USE
IT FOR--

06:52.954 --> 06:53.996
- UH, GUYS?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.665
COME AND LOOK AT THIS.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.762
- I SHALL SEARCH EVERY NOOK,

07:09.846 --> 07:10.388
EVERY CRANNY,

07:10.471 --> 07:11.681
EVERY LOOSE BOARD.

07:11.764 --> 07:17.520
I WILL STOP AT NOTHING UNTIL
MY BRACELET IS FOUND.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.273
MY REAL BRACELET.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.818
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

07:23.901 --> 07:26.195
- THOSE ARE MY SCHOOL BOOKS.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
- YES.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.494
THE PERFECT EXCUSE
TO BE LATE WITH HOMEWORK.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.371
THANK YOU, VICTOR.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.831
- MAY I PLEASE REHEARSE
IN YOUR ROOM?

07:36.914 --> 07:39.375
- REHEARSE?

07:39.458 --> 07:41.711
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT DOING
THAT SONG TOMORROW, ARE YOU?

07:41.794 --> 07:43.212
- WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.007
- WELL, NOT EVERYBODY
WANTS TO HEAR A SONG

07:46.090 --> 07:47.383
ABOUT HOW GREAT I AM.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.718
- I DON'T CARE WHO HEARS IT.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.928
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU DID YOUR
HISTORY SPEECH ABOUT ME.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.555
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.599
- IT'LL BE FINE.

07:56.517 --> 08:00.188
- DOES IT MENTION MY NAME?

08:00.271 --> 08:02.815
ALFIE, COME HERE.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.233
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.068
WHEN MARA SINGS
THAT DRIBBLEY SONG,

08:06.152 --> 08:08.654
WILLOW IS GOING TO KNOW THAT
MARA AND I ARE STILL TOGETHER.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.989
- I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.455
- HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP
UNTIL HE FINDS THAT BRACELET.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.333
- I'LL JUST HIDE IT.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.375
- THERE'S NOWHERE IN THE
BUILDING HE WON'T LOOK,

08:21.459 --> 08:23.836
AND WE'RE ALL ON LOCKDOWN.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.921
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE WE CAN GO.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.256
- TRUE.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.259
UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIAL
PERMISSION FROM THE HEADMASTER

08:30.343 --> 08:31.594
TO GO TO THE SCHOOL BECAUSE--

08:31.677 --> 08:35.014
BECAUSE IT'S TAKE-OUT NIGHT.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.975
WAIT HERE.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.313
- ARE YOU A CROCODILE
OR AN ALLIGATOR?

08:42.395 --> 08:45.900
I CAN NEVER TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.985
OH, SO SCARY, ISN'T HE?

08:48.069 --> 08:48.986
HONESTLY.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.321
- WILLOW?

08:50.404 --> 08:51.072
- OH, HEY.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.074
IS HE STILL SEARCHING?

08:53.157 --> 08:55.952
IT IS SO EXCITING.

08:56.035 --> 09:00.039
THE ONLY THING THAT EVER GOES
MISSING AT OUR HOUSE IS FUN.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.749
BORING.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.125
- YOU GET USED TO THIS STUFF
IN ANUBIS HOUSE.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.503
- I SUPPOSE YOU DO.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.548
I GOT CALLED IN
TO SEE MR. SWEET.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.465
- OH?

09:09.548 --> 09:10.508
- I THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE,

09:10.591 --> 09:12.176
BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO BE GOOD NEWS.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.805
- I JUST--I'M NOT SURE YOU
SHOULD HANG OUT HERE NOW,

09:15.888 --> 09:17.265
WHILST THE SEARCH IS GOING ON.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.476
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T WANT
YOU TO GET IN TROUBLE.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.145
WHICH IS WHY
I WANT TO WARN YOU

09:23.229 --> 09:25.898
AGAINST READING
THIS POEM TOMORROW.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.483
- WHY?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.987
- I JUST DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO MAKE FUN OF YOU.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.488
PEOPLE CAN BE VERY CRUEL.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.199
I WANT TO PROTECT YOU
FROM ALL THAT.

09:35.283 --> 09:39.161
- OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.372
YOU REALLY WANT TO PROTECT
MY FEELINGS.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.707
- I DO.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.041
I REALLY DO.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.003
- THAT JUST MAKES ME WANT TO
READ IT OUT EVEN MORE.

09:47.086 --> 09:51.924
NOW, WHAT RHYMES WITH DIMPLES?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.125
- HENRY.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.877
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.588
- OH, YEAH, I JUST CAME TO LOOK
AT THE SHIELD.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.006
YOU KNOW,
I GET A TEAR IN MY EYE

10:32.089 --> 10:33.549
WHEN I THINK
OF THE SCHOOL'S ACHIEVEMENTS.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.676
- YOU CAN LOOK,
BUT DON'T TOUCH.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.927
- I'M SHOCKED.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.054
LIKE I'D EVEN THINK ABOUT--

10:38.137 --> 10:39.263
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.556
- NOTHING.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.933
IT WAS JUST LOOSE, I THINK,
BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE--

10:43.017 --> 10:44.226
- STEP ASIDE.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.644
- BUT AREN'T WE
ORDERING CHINESE?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.855
- STEP ASIDE!

11:00.159 --> 11:02.078
- SEE?

11:02.161 --> 11:02.745
NOTHING OUT OF PLACE, RIGHT?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.622
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST--

11:06.749 --> 11:09.251
- DAD, I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO LOOK BEHIND THERE.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.628
- GIVE ME ON REASON WHY NOT.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.630
- IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY GIFT.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.256
- MY WHAT?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.758
- YEAH, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY GIFT.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.676
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO FIND IT.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.764
- WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT IT
IN YOUR ROOM?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.432
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.102
WHAT IF MY FRIENDS FOUND OUT
THAT I BOUGHT AN EXPENSIVE GIFT

11:26.185 --> 11:27.228
FOR THE HEADMASTER, ALL RIGHT?

11:27.311 --> 11:29.980
I'VE GOT A REPUTATION
TO PROTECT.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.774
- EXPENSIVE?

11:31.857 --> 11:33.943
- EDISON, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.778
- I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S WHAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.573
- LET'S GO GET THAT TAKE OUT.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.866
- OKAY.

11:40.950 --> 11:41.867
- MY TREAT, OF COURSE.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.293
EDISON?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.629
CHICKEN CHOW MEIN?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.226
- VICTOR?

12:07.309 --> 12:08.727
HE'S STILL IN CRAZY LAND
UP THERE.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.062
- GREAT.

12:10.146 --> 12:14.483
OKAY, WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS
I COULDN'T HIDE IT.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.776
THE GOOD NEWS.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.863
I DID HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD
CHINESE FOOD, THOUGH.

12:18.946 --> 12:19.822
- EDDIE.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.073
- THAT'S NICE.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.285
- ALL OF YOU,
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS THIS SECOND.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.327
- WHAT DO WE DO?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.204
- COME ON.

12:27.288 --> 12:27.872
DIDN'T WE ALREADY DO THIS?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.165
- NO MORE DEFIANCE.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.791
DO AS I SAY.

12:30.875 --> 12:35.337
YOU, SWEET JUNIOR,
YOU CAN BE FIRST.

12:35.421 --> 12:35.921
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.842
- I CAN'T.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.678
- I SHALL TELL YOU
ONE MORE TIME.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.971
EMPTY THEM.

12:44.054 --> 12:44.972
- VICTOR?
- WHAT?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.140
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

12:46.223 --> 12:47.349
- NO!
I AM CONDUCTING A SEARCH.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.517
- HOW IS THAT MORE IMPORTANT

12:48.601 --> 12:51.729
THAN THE WELL-BEING
OF THE CHILDREN?

12:51.812 --> 12:54.482
- OH, WE'RE JUST SO EXHAUSTED,
TRUDY.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.358
- ALL WE WANT TO DO IS SLEEP,
BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.359
- HOW VERY AMUSING.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.612
- REALLY TIRED.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.364
- DON'T YOU HAVE A DUTY
TO PERFORM, VICTOR?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.450
IT'S 10:00.

13:08.454 --> 13:12.041
- YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES
PRECISELY.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.544
THEN I WANT TO HEAR A PIN DROP!

13:18.464 --> 13:19.840
- GO ON, EVERYONE.

13:19.924 --> 13:24.011
YOU ALL NEED YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP,
UNLIKE ME.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.726
- WE GOT LUCKY.

13:30.809 --> 13:34.104
ALL RIGHT, THE SOONER WE GET THE
CEREMONY DONE, THE BETTER.

13:34.188 --> 13:34.647
AGREED?

13:34.730 --> 13:36.649
- OH, YEAH.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.317
- GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.
- NIGHT.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.167
- IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO HELP
LIKE THIS, PATRICIA,

13:55.251 --> 13:56.544
IF UNEXPECTED.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.128
- VERY UNEXPECTED.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.838
- OH, COME ON, SIR.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.090
YOU KNOW ME.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.634
I'M TOTALLY COMMUNITY SPIRITED.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.972
- "THE DARK SUN IS BORN,
AND HE MUST DIE.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.100
THEN THE DARK SUN OF EGYPT
SHALL RISE AGAIN."

14:11.183 --> 14:12.601
NO, NO,
I'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.436
THE TRANSLATION,
I KNOW I'VE MADE A MISTAKE.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.271
- YOU DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.689
ALL RIGHT, IT'S JUST NERVES.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.940
ALL RIGHT?

14:18.023 --> 14:20.401
- OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.610
- SHOULDN'T PATRICIA BE HERE?

14:21.694 --> 14:22.903
- DECIDED IT WAS SAFER
IF ONE OF US

14:22.987 --> 14:24.947
MADE AN APPEARANCE
AT THE OPEN DAY.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.120
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

14:31.203 --> 14:32.788
- IT'S MY CAMOUFLAGE.

14:32.871 --> 14:33.455
I DON'T THINK IT'S
DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB

14:33.539 --> 14:36.542
IF YOU CAN SEE ME.

14:36.625 --> 14:36.875
OOH.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.754
- HAS DENBY LEFT
THE GATEHOUSE YET?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.965
- THE BIRDIE HAS
FLOWN THE NEST.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.049
REPEAT.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.636
THE BIRDIE HAS
FLOWN THE NEST.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.513
YES, SHE'S GONE.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.432
- OKAY, GOOD, WELL,
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.270
- LET'S GO WAKE UP OLD FROBIE.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.439
- AH!

14:59.565 --> 15:00.482
HEY.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.734
UH.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.701
- WE MADE IT.

15:16.915 --> 15:18.500
- HEY, GREAT-GRANDPA.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.796
WHEN YOU'RE UP AND ABOUT,

15:22.880 --> 15:25.924
I'VE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.761
- WELCOME TO DEEP DOO-DOO,
EVERYONE.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.930
I HAVE A BAD, BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.224
- HEY, GUYS.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.517
WE'RE ALMOST HOME FREE, OKAY?

15:35.601 --> 15:36.518
WE GOT THE BRACELET.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.811
- THE BODY.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.190
- THE INSTRUCTIONS
FROM THE NOTES.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.232
- THE INCANTATION.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.610
- AND THE DESCENDENT.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.403
- OF COURSE!

15:46.487 --> 15:48.614
- OF COURSE GOOD
OR OF COURSE BAD?

15:48.697 --> 15:49.948
- OH, HOW COULD I NOT SEE IT?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.158
I'VE BEEN SO STUPID.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.826
- WE GOT THE WRONG
SLEEPING VICTORIAN DUDE.

15:52.910 --> 15:53.744
I KNEW IT.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.664
- NO, NO, NO.
THE RHYME.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.499
"WHEN THE DARK SUN IS BORN
IN THE ENGLISH SKY

15:58.582 --> 15:59.958
"AND CHILDREN OF CHILDREN SLEEP
THE DAY BY,

16:00.042 --> 16:02.503
"IF THE LOOTER FINDS
THE SLEEPING MAN,

16:02.586 --> 16:05.881
AND THE DARK SUN OF EGYPT
SALL RISE AGAIN."

16:09.134 --> 16:10.803
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

16:16.183 --> 16:18.018
- I NEED SOME EXTENSION CORDS,
MR. SWEET.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.270
- I'VE GOT SOME
AT THE GATEHOUSE.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.271
I'LL GO AND GET THEM.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.731
- NOPE.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.275
I MEAN, I KNOW WHERE
VICTOR KEEPS THEM ALL,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.403
SO IT'LL JUST BE QUICKER
IF I GO GET THEM.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.821
- VERY WELL, PATRICIA,
OFF YOU GO.

16:28.904 --> 16:29.988
- THANKS, PATTY.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.410
- YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S BEHAVING STRANGELY?

16:34.493 --> 16:35.619
- WELL, IF PATRICIA WANTS
TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF,

16:35.703 --> 16:38.330
WHO AM I TO COMPLAIN?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.210
- AH, I'M SORRY, GUYS.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.211
I'VE SCREWED UP.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.379
THE WORD SUN,

16:45.462 --> 16:46.922
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS THE SAME SYMBOL,

16:47.005 --> 16:49.341
BUT IT'S NOT.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.926
THE LAST ONE IN THE RHYME

16:51.009 --> 16:53.512
MEANS SON AS IN
FATHER AND SON.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.805
WHEREAS THE FIRST ONE
IN THE RHYME

16:54.888 --> 16:57.391
MEANS SUN IN THE SKY.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.101
- OKAY?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.936
- DARK SON.

17:01.019 --> 17:04.565
IS--IS ANYONE--
ANYONE GETTING THIS?

17:04.647 --> 17:05.315
ANYONE?

17:05.398 --> 17:07.568
- NO.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.861
- NIGHTTIME.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.404
- OH.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.698
- IT'S TELLING US WE HAVE TO
WAIT TILL NIGHTTIME.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.781
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
STAY HERE UNTIL NIGHTTIME

17:13.866 --> 17:16.617
WITHOUT ANYONE FINDING US?

17:16.702 --> 17:20.164
- I GUESS WE HAVE
TO GET THAT TANK OUT.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.080
- WHAT?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.624
- WE NEED TO HIDE IT.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.336
SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE AREN'T
ANY PEOPLE DURING THE DAY.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.756
- THE CRYPT.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.758
NO PEOPLE DURING THE DAY.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.301
WELL, YOU KNOW, LIVING ANYWAY.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.094
- WELL, WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE CRYPT IS.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.220
WE KNOW THERE'S
A PASSAGE FROM ANUBIS,

17:35.304 --> 17:38.015
BUT WE CAN'T FIT HIM
THROUGH THAT.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.725
- WHAT, YOU KIDDING?

17:39.808 --> 17:41.977
WHAT, YOU THINK I DID THE
WHOLE ZOMBIE THING FOR NOTHING?

17:42.060 --> 17:43.145
YOU THINK I'D COME UP HERE
WITHOUT MAPPING OUT A LIST

17:43.228 --> 17:45.147
OF POSSIBLE ZOMBIE HOTSPOTS,
SEE?

17:47.858 --> 17:50.277
HERE, HERE, HERE,

17:50.360 --> 17:51.862
AND THE CRYPT.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.071
- ALFIE, THAT'S GREAT.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.157
OKAY, WE'LL PUT HIM
IN THE CRYPT.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.577
THIS JUST LEAVES
ONE OTHER QUESTION.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.412
HOW?

18:09.046 --> 18:10.672
- HELLO, EVERYONE.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.509
WE HAVE SOME GREAT ENTERTAINMENT
LINED UP FOR YOU TODAY

18:13.592 --> 18:16.136
SHOWING THE REMARKABLE HIDDEN
TALENTS OF SOME OF OUR PUPILS.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.643
[applause]

18:22.726 --> 18:25.771
SO FIRST UP, YOU KNOW HIM.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.439
SOME OF YOU EVEN LOVE HIM,
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

18:27.523 --> 18:31.527
HERE IS JEROME CLARK WITH HIS
HILARIOUS BALLOON ANIMALS.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.278
[balloon hissing]

18:34.738 --> 18:36.573
[weak applause]

18:38.075 --> 18:39.284
- FIVE MORE MINUTES.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.661
- WHO WILL BE ON
IN FIVE MINUTES.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.914
SO IN THE MEANTIME,
SILENT JENNY, EVERYBODY.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.124
YAY.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.129
- SEEMS BIGGER
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO MOVE IT.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.589
- COME ON, OSIRIAN,

18:52.673 --> 18:56.426
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON THE VERGE
OF SOME BRILLIANT PLAN.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.387
- YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

18:58.470 --> 19:04.226
I MEAN, IF WE DO THIS,
IF WE STEAL A PERSON

19:04.309 --> 19:07.563
AND THEY FIND OUT,
WHICH THEY WILL,

19:07.646 --> 19:09.815
THINGS ARE NEVER
GOING TO BE THE SAME.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.360
- HE'S MY GREAT-GRANDPA.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.487
I'M KIND OF STARTING
TO LIKE HIM.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.031
- YOU GUYS THINK I SHOULD
PRESS THIS BUTTON?

19:18.115 --> 19:18.991
- NO.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.033
NO, NO, NO!

19:20.117 --> 19:22.286
- ALFIE,
DO NOT PRESS ANY BUTTONS.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.705
- NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.540
- LIKE I WOULD BE DUMB ENOUGH
TO PRESS A BUTTON.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.375
- YOU ALREADY PRESSED THE
BUTTON, DIDN'T YOU?

19:28.458 --> 19:29.585
- I ALREADY PRESSED
THE BUTTON.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.545
[thud]

19:31.628 --> 19:33.630
[bell dings]

19:33.714 --> 19:34.298
- WHAT IS IT?

19:36.925 --> 19:37.926
- IT'S AN ELEVATOR.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.804
ALFIE, YOU LITTLE GENIUS.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.681
- WELCOME TO OUR PLAN.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.268
[bell dings]

19:50.355 --> 19:51.523
- OKAY, OKAY.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.150
ALFIE, CAN YOU MOVE THAT CHAIR,
PLEASE?

19:53.233 --> 19:54.943
QUICKLY?

19:58.780 --> 20:01.241
- NOT REALLY A GOOD TIME
TO BE UPDATING YOUR STATUS.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.534
- I'M TEXTING PATRICIA.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.286
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
ABOUT THE CHANGE OF PLANS.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.454
- IT CAN'T WAIT?

20:05.537 --> 20:07.414
[applause]

20:07.497 --> 20:08.916
[phone chimes]

20:10.834 --> 20:12.461
- MOVING THE TANK.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.466
I'VE GOT THAT CORD.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.759
- OH, I THINK JOY MANAGED
WITHOUT IT.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.303
BUT THANK YOU.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.555
MS. DENBY, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
FORM THE WELCOMING COMMITTEE.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.182
COULD YOU GET VICTOR, PLEASE?

20:25.265 --> 20:26.850
- WELCOMING COMMITTEE?

20:26.934 --> 20:27.976
- YOU SHOULD BE OUTSIDE.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.938
THE GOVERNOR'S
ARE ABOUT TO ARRIVE.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.898
SHALL WE HEAD
TO THE WELCOME TENT?

20:38.695 --> 20:41.323
- EDDIE, TELL ME
YOU'RE NOWHERE NEAR THE SCHOOL.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.658
- OKAY, WELL,
DEFINE "NEAR THE SCHOOL."

20:42.741 --> 20:44.660
OKAY, YES.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.495
OKAY, I GET IT.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.371
BYE.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.875
GUYS.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.543
GUYS, HEY.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.962
WE GOT ABOUT ONE MINUTE

20:55.045 --> 20:56.964
UNTIL VICTOR, SWEET, AND DENBY
COME THROUGH THAT DOOR,

20:57.047 --> 20:57.923
ALL RIGHT?

20:58.006 --> 20:58.757
LET'S GO.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.967
- HEY, GUYS?
HEY, GUYS.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.802
WE COULD USE THIS.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.261
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.267
- I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS MYSELF.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.686
- THERE'S NO SHAME
IN BACKING DOWN.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.895
- NO WAY.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.105
I WANT TO DO MY SONG.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.233
AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.989
- HEY.
- HI.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.409
- I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
MY POEM IS GOING TO BE GREAT.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.535
- GREAT.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.786
- I EVEN FOUND SOMETHING
THAT RHYMES WITH JEROME.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.329
BREAK A LEG.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.292
- BOTH, IF I GET FOUND OUT.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.629
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

21:37.713 --> 21:42.259
ONE, TWO, THREE.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.510
WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE CRYPT

21:43.593 --> 21:44.177
JUST AS LONG AS
WE DON'T STOP FOR--

21:44.261 --> 21:46.930
- WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.015
- ANYTHING.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.224
- WHAT'S UNDER THERE?

21:49.307 --> 21:51.351
- OH, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
TRUDY,

21:51.435 --> 21:53.729
WE REALLY NEED TO BE
SOMEWHERE RIGHT NOW.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.272
- OH, COME ON.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.691
YOU DON'T NEED
TO KEEP SECRETS FROM TRUDY.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.031
EDDIE?

22:04.114 --> 22:05.073
OKAY, NOW I'M CONCERNED.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.408
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

22:06.491 --> 22:10.829
UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHAT IS UNDER HERE.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.999
WHAT IS UNDER HERE?
