when Mom and Dad
brought you home

02:57.767 --> 02:59.000
from the hospital, but, uh,

02:59.000 --> 03:00.600
you're still here.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.600
Uh, the reason I called is,

03:18.600 --> 03:20.500
I can't hang out with you
on Friday night.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.667
No.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.400
Um, why not?
I'm sorry,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.500
but I forgot I promised
to take my little sister

03:25.500 --> 03:26.600
to Pizza Pals.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.834
Pizza Pals?

03:29.834 --> 03:30.967
What's Pizza Pals?

03:30.967 --> 03:33.800
You know, the pizza place
for kids.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.233
They got these crazy characters,
like a robot and a giant

03:37.233 --> 03:38.400
teddy bear.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.100

03:43.667 --> 03:44.967
I'm so there.

03:44.967 --> 03:45.900
What?

03:45.900 --> 03:47.233
I mean, Devon, hey,

03:47.233 --> 03:48.734
you got a little sister,
you know?

03:48.734 --> 03:49.734
And guess what?

03:49.734 --> 03:50.800
I have a little brother,

03:50.800 --> 03:53.400
so you know,
we can get them together.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.400
Sounds cool,
because Nadine and I

03:55.400 --> 03:56.600
are really close.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.600
I think that's so important.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.400
So do I.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.600
Yeah.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.233
In fact, uh...

04:03.233 --> 04:04.800
( grunts )

04:04.800 --> 04:09.734
...my brother and I,
we couldn't be much closer.

04:09.734 --> 04:12.000
Oh. Oh.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.734
Cool.

04:12.734 --> 04:13.834
Yeah, so, um,

04:13.834 --> 04:15.700
we'll see you Friday
at Pizza Pals, okay?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.000

04:21.233 --> 04:22.367
You know how
Mom and Dad

04:22.367 --> 04:23.767
are always telling us
that one day

04:23.767 --> 04:25.100
we're going to need each other.

04:25.734 --> 04:27.133
That day is here.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.000
Then it's going to be
a very expensive date for you.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.000

sweater vests.

04:50.767 --> 04:52.000
Part of our deal

04:52.000 --> 04:54.133
was that I get
to pick out your clothes, okay?

04:54.133 --> 04:55.667
We have to be color-coordinated

04:55.667 --> 04:57.834
so Devon knows how close we are.

04:57.834 --> 04:59.400
I hate it.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.667
No, you don't.

You love it.

you love your loving sister.

10:03.567 --> 10:04.967
Ready?

10:04.967 --> 10:07.367
For what?

10:07.367 --> 10:10.667
To play the game, silly.

10:13.567 --> 10:14.367
Hey!

10:14.367 --> 10:16.000
Hey!

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
My brother

10:17.000 --> 10:18.100
only has

10:18.100 --> 10:18.967
time for

10:18.967 --> 10:20.133
me.
Oh...

10:20.133 --> 10:21.300
Corey...

10:21.300 --> 10:23.300
I got the tokens.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.500
What?

10:24.500 --> 10:25.934
Raven, you okay?

10:25.934 --> 10:27.900
She just had a little accident.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.033
Yeah.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.100
The-the mallet fell on me

10:31.100 --> 10:32.133
again and again

10:32.133 --> 10:34.200
( under her breath ):
and again.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.667
Look, our pizza's ready.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.800
Great. I'm starved.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.100
This kiss better be worth it.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.400
COREY:
So,

10:42.400 --> 10:45.800
what do you like
on your pizza?

10:45.800 --> 10:48.400
Uh! Corey,
get over here.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.500
In your face, pip-squeak.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.033
( squishy slosh )

10:56.033 --> 10:58.200
That didn't sound too good.

11:04.967 --> 11:08.133
Now it's in your face, Grandma.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.834
( Corey laughs )

11:12.100 --> 11:14.500
Hey, Corey,
what are you laughing at?

11:16.400 --> 11:19.233
This is your piece.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.500
( monkey chattering )

11:26.500 --> 11:27.734
You guys, this is,
like, my third time

11:27.734 --> 11:29.300
seeing My Big, Fat
Monkey Wedding,

11:29.300 --> 11:31.500
and every time,
it gets to me.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.867
Get over
it, Chels.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.500
It's sad.
Hey.

11:37.133 --> 11:38.900
It's time to play Contwingo.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.033
CHELSEA:
Oh,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.967
you're right.
I will lay out

11:41.967 --> 11:44.100
the Contwingo mat
and the Contwirler

11:44.100 --> 11:45.400
and the Contwimer.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.700
Okay.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.400
Uh, kids,
it's getting late,

11:54.400 --> 11:55.734
and, um...

11:55.734 --> 11:57.734
( clucking like chicken )

11:57.734 --> 11:59.600
Oh.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.900
I know
you didn't just cluck at me.

12:02.767 --> 12:03.934
Uh, I'm sorry.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.133
I believe he just did.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.233
Um...

12:06.233 --> 12:07.500
( laughs )

12:07.500 --> 12:08.467
Baby, let it go.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.667
It's just a cluck.

12:09.667 --> 12:10.667
Not in my house.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.567
Uh, spin
that Contwirler, girl.

12:12.567 --> 12:13.834
Okay.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.600
Okay. Right hand, nine,
left knee, seven.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.300
Go.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.233
Go get 'em, tiger.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.300
Okay.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.700
Left knee.
Mm-hmm.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.767
Right hand.

12:27.767 --> 12:28.934
( cracking )

12:28.934 --> 12:30.400
( groaning )

12:30.400 --> 12:32.133
Got you,
Mr. B.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.500
Psych your mind.
CHELSEA:
Ah!

12:33.500 --> 12:34.967
Dude, you moved your hand.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.100
Two points for us.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.734
They contwicked me.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.200
All right. Corey,
how does it look?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.300
Can't even tell.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.033
Good. Now, listen, man,

12:50.033 --> 12:52.367
you got to start
doing your job.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.567
Here. Take this bucket
of tokens, all right?

12:54.567 --> 12:55.767
And when I suggest

12:55.767 --> 12:57.767
that you and Nadine
go play some games,

12:57.767 --> 12:58.900
you act excited.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.667
Got it.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.200
Good. Let's go.

13:02.934 --> 13:04.867
Hey, everybody, I have an idea.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.600
Corey, why don't you
and Nadine go play some games?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.033
Nah.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.800
Go on, Nadine.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.400
You guys should get
to know each other.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.367
Okay, Devvy.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.800
Take your time.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
( humming )

13:29.100 --> 13:32.800
I want that blue monkey.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.834
Yeah, and I want
a million bucks.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.100
Life's tough.

13:36.100 --> 13:41.867
I said, I want that blue monkey.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.867
( voice cracking ):
Okay, then.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.467
So, here we are.

13:48.467 --> 13:49.600
Yeah.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.900
I'm really glad you
came tonight, Rae.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.567
So am I.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.133
It's really nice
that we can finally be alone.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.233
Just me and you.

14:00.367 --> 14:01.767
( game noise )

14:01.767 --> 14:04.700
No robot.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.700
No teddy bear.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.367
But, hey, who needs them?

14:09.367 --> 14:11.600
( laughs )

14:12.500 --> 14:13.900
Corey won me a monkey.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.400
Hey, Deeny.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.600
Hey, Deeny.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.600
Deeny, where's my brother?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.133
He really got into the game.

14:30.734 --> 14:31.934
( gasps )

14:31.934 --> 14:33.967
Corey, what are you doing
in there?

14:33.967 --> 14:35.367
BOY:
Mommy,

14:35.367 --> 14:36.667
I want that big head.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.500
I'll get you a duck, little boy.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.767
The big head's mine.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.600
Well, we're
finally together.

14:50.033 --> 14:52.300
( groans )

14:53.200 --> 14:55.100
Okay.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.500
Left ear, 22, Mr. B.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.934
Oh, okay.

14:58.934 --> 15:00.567
Here goes.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.734
( cracking )

15:01.734 --> 15:02.734
( grunts )

15:02.734 --> 15:03.967
( laughs )

15:03.967 --> 15:05.033
You're not going to get me

15:05.033 --> 15:06.500
with that fake
water bottle trick.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.700
( laughs )

15:07.700 --> 15:09.800
I didn't do nothing.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.767
Uh-oh.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.100
Here come the pain.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.767
( groaning )

15:17.767 --> 15:18.867
Oh. Oh.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.033
Aw.
Aw.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.233
Contwingo!
Contwingo!

15:21.233 --> 15:22.400
Yes!

15:22.400 --> 15:23.834
Oh. That was
really good.

15:23.834 --> 15:24.967
Rematch.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.200
Victor, get off
your contweester.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.934
Um, I-I think
we ought to call it a night.

15:30.934 --> 15:33.667
Wow. I am really sorry
about your back, Mr. B.

15:33.667 --> 15:34.100
Whoo!

15:34.100 --> 15:35.300
Yeah, man,
you should get some rest.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.867
Yeah.
So you're ready
for next week.

15:36.867 --> 15:37.900
Yes!
All right.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.567
Oh!

15:43.967 --> 15:45.400
( door closes )

15:45.400 --> 15:48.300
I'm sorry
I got carried away, baby.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.600
How's your back?

15:49.600 --> 15:50.800
It's fine.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.033
I just faked it
so we can have time alone.

15:53.033 --> 15:54.567
( crackling )

15:54.567 --> 15:57.300
You did that for us?

15:57.300 --> 15:58.133
Yeah.

15:58.133 --> 15:59.100
What's wrong with you?

15:59.100 --> 16:00.200
We could have won.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.367
Hey! Get back here!

16:04.367 --> 16:07.200
It's not over.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.300
Thanks for getting me
out of The Claw.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.500
No problem, but I
still don't understand

16:16.500 --> 16:18.133
how Nadine got
you in there.

16:18.133 --> 16:20.300
Raven, she can do things.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.000
Scary things.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.367
I want to go home.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.133
Corey, we can't
go home, okay?

16:26.133 --> 16:27.300
I had a vision,

16:27.300 --> 16:28.967
and we can't leave
until it comes true.

16:28.967 --> 16:31.300
Your vision, your problem.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.467
Corey!

16:33.467 --> 16:35.133
Corey?!

16:35.133 --> 16:38.500
Corey, listen,
um, the...

16:38.500 --> 16:40.300
The vision was that...

16:40.300 --> 16:43.500
Devon was going to kiss me
during the Pizza Pal show.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.800
Ooh!

16:44.800 --> 16:47.300
Don't gross me out
with your love life.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.133
I know you don't understand now,
okay?

16:50.133 --> 16:52.400
But I really, really like him.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.934
And this might be
my only chance.

16:54.934 --> 16:57.400
Oh, I understand smooching.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.834
I just don't understand

16:58.834 --> 17:01.700
why somebody would want
to smooch with you.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
But... if it's
that important to you,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'll help out.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.834
Thanks, little bro.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.000
You are the best.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.100
I know.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.400
You'll be getting my bill.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.734
All right, you guys.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.100
Time for the Pizza Pal show.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.033
Oh, sorry.
Show's canceled.

17:24.033 --> 17:26.100
No. It can't be canceled.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.300
Sorry, but we're having
some technical difficulties

17:28.300 --> 17:29.367
with our pirate.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.767
No! Not Captain
Pepperoni.

17:31.767 --> 17:33.400
He's my favorite.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.867
Mine, too.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.800
Wait, wait, wait.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.000
Wait. You don't
understand,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.367
okay? The show

17:39.367 --> 17:40.467
must go on.

17:40.467 --> 17:42.000
It's the robot
and the teddy bear and...

17:42.000 --> 17:43.500
Think of the children.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.400
Okay. Here's the deal.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.900
I'm really tired,

17:46.900 --> 17:48.834
I've just worked
a double shift,

17:48.834 --> 17:50.700
the pirate's
leaking oil, so

17:50.700 --> 17:52.967
back up off me!

17:52.967 --> 17:54.834
Awesome.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.967
I did not put up
with all this

17:57.967 --> 17:59.300
to not get my kiss.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.567
Devvy,

18:01.567 --> 18:03.000
I want to go home.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.233
Okay.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.467
I'm sorry, Rae,

18:05.467 --> 18:08.000
but she was really
looking forward to the show.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.200
No, wait, wait, wait...

18:09.200 --> 18:10.700
Stay. Wait a second.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.934
Okay, the show is going
to go on, whatever it takes.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.200
I'm going to make sure

18:15.200 --> 18:17.500
they put the pep back
in Captain Pepperoni.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.367
So, stay. Don't move.

18:22.934 --> 18:24.233
This is boring.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.967
If there's no show,

18:25.967 --> 18:27.734
I want to go home.

18:27.734 --> 18:29.100
Okay, Deeny.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.834
Just let me say good-bye
to Raven first.

18:30.834 --> 18:33.200
Why? She probably already left.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.300
She doesn't care about us.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.934
Oh, trust me, she cares.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.500

20:13.200 --> 20:13.700
Oh.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.800
Yes, Devon.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.900
Are you

20:15.900 --> 20:17.667
okay?

20:20.200 --> 20:21.367
Never better.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.567
( laughs )

20:25.467 --> 20:26.600
Good. I mean,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.100
'cause you hit the
deck pretty hard.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.133
I mean, what were
you thinking
going up there?

20:33.033 --> 20:36.300
Yeah. What was I thinking?

20:36.300 --> 20:38.667
But I'm glad you're okay.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.000
Um...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.734
that was for,

20:47.734 --> 20:49.000
uh, being nice
to my sister.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.367
( laughs )

20:50.367 --> 20:53.000
You got any more sisters?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.700
Kind of makes you sick,
doesn't it?

20:58.700 --> 21:00.900
Don't get me started.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.233
We used to have fun

21:02.233 --> 21:04.700
until girls started
liking Devon.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.600
Now, I barely get
to hang out with him.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.300
So, are you going
to make Raven's life miserable

21:10.300 --> 21:11.600
every chance you get?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.867
That's the plan.

21:12.867 --> 21:14.400
It's going to fun working

21:14.400 --> 21:16.500
with you.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.100
Hey, y'all.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.200
Hey.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.734
EDDIE:
Hey.

21:31.734 --> 21:32.867
She's still smiling.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.500
She must have had fun
with Devon.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.867
Yeah, but was it worth
missing Contwingo?

21:36.867 --> 21:38.800
It was awesome!

21:38.800 --> 21:40.100
( laughs )

21:40.100 --> 21:41.467
We took our relationship

21:41.467 --> 21:43.867
to a whole new level.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.900
Oh, hey, Devon.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.767
Hey, Raven.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.300
Later.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.000
( laughs )

21:55.000 --> 21:56.734
( high-pitched squeal )

21:56.734 --> 21:57.734
You see?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.834
Yeah!
