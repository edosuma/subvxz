00:53.923 --> 00:55.055
Thanks, man.

00:57.267 --> 00:59.617
- Uh-huh, yeah, just get here.
- Rick.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.844
Get... just shut up and get here.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.413
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey, Garrett.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.455
When'd you hit town?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.346
Came to see my kid.
I got to run, though.

01:06.383 --> 01:08.140
If I stick around, I'll call you.

01:08.463 --> 01:09.966
It's good to see you, Garrett.

01:09.991 --> 01:11.079
What are we doing here?

01:11.104 --> 01:12.560
Okay, don't be such a snob.

01:12.905 --> 01:14.260
It's one of the few places that carries

01:14.285 --> 01:16.215
- this bakery's muffins.
- Okay.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.875
Uh, hey, I-I'll see you, Rick.

01:17.900 --> 01:21.425
Anyway, about this
party tomorrow night...

01:21.900 --> 01:23.997
Oh, so you don't dress up
like a movie star,

01:24.038 --> 01:26.508
you dress up like a
character from a movie.

01:26.827 --> 01:30.315
I know that.
I'm going as Julia Roberts.

01:30.914 --> 01:34.063
- That's not a character.
- Well, I want to go as her.

01:34.643 --> 01:36.855
Last week my husband
told me that I looked

01:36.880 --> 01:38.526
like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman.

01:38.553 --> 01:40.265
So go as Vivian Ward from Pretty Woman.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.963
Wait, he said you
looked like Julia Roberts

01:43.002 --> 01:45.613
- specifically in Pretty Woman?
- Mm-hmm.

01:45.819 --> 01:47.646
I think he might've been
trying to tell you

01:47.671 --> 01:49.238
that you were dressed like a whore.

01:52.255 --> 01:53.309
That's not a bad thing.

01:53.334 --> 01:54.581
- Really?
- No, it's good.

01:54.606 --> 01:56.521
They like that kind of stuff.

02:00.942 --> 02:02.739
What, are you fucking serious?

02:03.710 --> 02:06.417
Oh, my God, I am so sorry. I...

02:06.604 --> 02:08.326
Sorry.

02:08.424 --> 02:10.121
I thought you were...

02:10.419 --> 02:13.089
The kid lives over on Maple.

02:16.079 --> 02:17.888
I'm sorry, I apologize.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.411
I can't believe he took it.

03:38.314 --> 03:40.989
I'm paying you to find out
who my husband is screwing,

03:41.014 --> 03:43.180
not who he's screwing over.

03:43.281 --> 03:45.141
I told you where he was last night.

03:45.236 --> 03:46.989
He was pitching condos to brokers,

03:47.014 --> 03:49.712
one after another,
at the Fairmont Hotel bar.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.168
I watched him and he didn't
leave with any of them.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.138
Then you keep looking.

03:54.325 --> 03:56.284
He's a million miles away these days.

03:56.993 --> 04:00.501
He went on a diet.

04:00.894 --> 04:03.473
A man with his appetites
does not go on a diet.

04:03.594 --> 04:05.768
People's metabolisms change.

04:05.873 --> 04:08.005
Could it be somebody in his yoga class?

04:08.249 --> 04:10.207
Nah, I don't know why he does yoga.

04:10.511 --> 04:13.296
Not for the asses in yoga pants.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.203
He does yoga and he runs an hour

04:15.228 --> 04:16.958
on the treadmill every day
so that he looks good.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.920
Why does he want to look good?

04:19.346 --> 04:20.524
To get laid.

04:22.399 --> 04:26.229
- If you say so.
- Stay with him.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.224
We got the Abatsy party tomorrow night.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.672
I'll have eyes out, obviously,

04:29.697 --> 04:31.505
but maybe you could be on the grounds.

04:31.665 --> 04:34.709
- See what you see.
- Yeah. Sure.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.557
And that is for next week.

04:46.336 --> 04:48.629
What the fuck?

04:49.096 --> 04:51.769
Let me guess, no note.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.050
Hey, Dannie.

05:36.806 --> 05:39.504
Glad I ran into you here.

05:40.584 --> 05:43.629
- Did you run into me?
- No, not really.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.183
How's your day been?
Still like your new job?

05:46.363 --> 05:49.806
Yeah, yeah, he's, uh... he's a handful.

05:51.223 --> 05:54.024
Listen, remember when you asked

05:54.054 --> 05:55.925
what was the top piece of advice

05:55.989 --> 05:57.599
I wished I'd had
before I started college?

05:57.695 --> 06:00.153
Thank God. I was afraid
I was gonna have to wing it.

06:00.226 --> 06:03.119
Well, see, I realized that...

06:03.450 --> 06:04.974
it's to be sure and make new friends

06:04.999 --> 06:06.348
the summer before you leave.

06:06.758 --> 06:09.379
Hmm. You're volunteering?

06:09.430 --> 06:11.578
I-I am. I'm brave like that.

06:13.884 --> 06:15.712
Do you want to hang out later?

06:15.856 --> 06:17.817
Like, tonight later?

06:17.967 --> 06:21.034
Why not? Unless you-you have plans.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.031
No.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.163
Well, now you do.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.085
Another day, right, Dante?

07:14.129 --> 07:15.304
Sure enough.

07:15.484 --> 07:19.484
Garrett Drimmer, hold up a minute.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.788
Fuckin' Walsh.

07:20.813 --> 07:21.964
See how he did that?

07:21.989 --> 07:25.123
Now you got to talk to him
on your own time.

07:28.158 --> 07:30.378
Hours have to be cut.

07:30.481 --> 07:32.806
And fingers are pointing
at the material handlers.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.767
I only got 50, 55 total
for you and Dante.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.762
You've been here longer.

07:39.405 --> 07:41.534
I know yinz two is friends.

07:41.656 --> 07:45.094
And don't worry, there is one option.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.327
You both cut eight to ten a week.

07:47.352 --> 07:49.400
I could make a case
to keep yous both on.

07:49.443 --> 07:50.980
Hours are money.

07:51.046 --> 07:55.572
All right, but I-it's your call.
I'm gonna have to cut him loose.

07:55.636 --> 07:57.320
Wait, wait, what'd you say, uh, 55?

07:57.377 --> 07:58.675
Yeah.

07:59.506 --> 08:01.713
Well, that-that means
with, uh, with him gone,

08:01.738 --> 08:03.479
I'm ripe for some OT?

08:05.713 --> 08:07.402
Yeah, I expect so.

08:07.462 --> 08:10.910
That's good.
Yeah, count me in for that.

08:14.058 --> 08:17.235
Hey. I got the car today.
You want a lift?

08:17.293 --> 08:19.645
Uh, man, y-you go ahead.

08:20.207 --> 08:22.818
Yeah, uh, walking keeps me motivated.

08:23.034 --> 08:24.732
Okay.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.548
Hey. GARRETT: Hey.

08:48.609 --> 08:50.001
She had a good nap today.

08:50.032 --> 08:52.861
- Aw, that's good.
- Yeah. Uh...

08:53.325 --> 08:56.400
You know, my husband was
watching this special on rheas,

08:56.467 --> 08:58.527
or ray-as, some are like ostriches.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.242
- Uh-huh.
- And the father rhea,

09:01.267 --> 09:02.834
takes care of them little ones,

09:02.859 --> 09:04.513
like from eggs on.

09:05.540 --> 09:08.239
But people ain't supposed
to be like that.

09:09.265 --> 09:10.767
Uh, well...

09:10.811 --> 09:12.637
- Here I am.
- Yeah.

09:12.662 --> 09:15.694
Well, I'm just saying,
we feel really bad for you,

09:15.854 --> 09:18.589
and we love having
little Carrie here now,

09:18.639 --> 09:21.322
but if you don't get caught up...

09:21.355 --> 09:23.465
Yeah... For a minute there,

09:23.490 --> 09:25.340
I thought you were being nice.

09:25.462 --> 09:29.097
Oh... Here. Look.

09:29.477 --> 09:31.557
You know, you could...

09:31.670 --> 09:33.187
No, I......take it if you want.

09:33.255 --> 09:36.619
- Yeah, no, I want what you owe me.
- Payday is next week.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.902
- Garrett, I heard that before,
- I'll-I'll have it then.

09:37.926 --> 09:38.981
I heard it before.

09:39.006 --> 09:41.081
Next week, or don't
bring her by no more.

09:41.138 --> 09:42.614
If I can't leave her
with somebody, then I can't...

09:42.638 --> 09:44.839
Yeah. Well, sorry.

09:45.873 --> 09:47.712
All right, look, um...

09:48.291 --> 09:50.641
You know, I'm-I'm fixing up
my dirt bike.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.287
I'm gonna sell it.

09:52.863 --> 09:54.093
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:54.161 --> 09:55.916
Okay, all right...

09:58.135 --> 10:00.268
What do you think? Let's go for a walk.

10:05.008 --> 10:07.271
I think it's over there.

10:08.889 --> 10:10.672
Whoa!

11:36.298 --> 11:37.798
- Hey.
<i>- Garrett.</i>

11:37.855 --> 11:41.772
<i>I need you to-to come down
to the mill right away.</i>

11:42.123 --> 11:44.081
What?

11:44.492 --> 11:46.278
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

11:46.342 --> 11:47.596
Yeah, wait, uh, y-yeah.

11:47.621 --> 11:49.647
What happened?

11:49.899 --> 11:52.033
<i>Can you just come down here?
You got to help me.</i>

11:52.117 --> 11:54.786
- Uh, right now?
<i>- Yes. Right now.</i>

11:54.849 --> 11:56.805
Wh... uh, what...?

11:57.059 --> 12:00.105
I can't come right now.
I got, I got Carrie.

12:00.334 --> 12:01.683
<i>Can you just...?</i>

12:06.530 --> 12:08.479
<i>Garrett, it's got to be you.</i>

12:08.598 --> 12:11.949
- Yeah, um...
- <i>I really need your help.</i>

12:14.095 --> 12:16.190
<i>Garrett, I need you.</i>

12:16.309 --> 12:18.213
Can you just, like, give me like 15...?

12:18.309 --> 12:20.099
<i>Yeah. Yeah, just...</i>

12:20.124 --> 12:21.583
<i>don't tell anybody where
you're going, all right?</i>

12:21.607 --> 12:24.697
Can you... yeah, just give me
like, give me like, uh,

12:24.754 --> 12:28.453
15 minutes, I'll...
and I'll be there, okay?

13:26.327 --> 13:28.048
Shh. Hey, hey.

13:28.116 --> 13:30.423
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Okay.

13:32.872 --> 13:34.749
So you've never snuck in here before?

13:34.774 --> 13:35.883
No.

13:35.908 --> 13:37.983
Cool, so I get points
for originality then.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.776
Unlike me, with the movie I chose.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.128
I hate how I always know
exactly what's about to happen

13:43.153 --> 13:45.155
but I still get scared.

13:47.122 --> 13:49.029
So you're going off to Michigan.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.910
- Right?
- Yeah.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.539
It's your last summer here.

13:52.605 --> 13:54.106
Mm.

13:55.746 --> 13:58.669
You know... the summer
before I started at Pitt,

13:58.694 --> 14:01.164
- my parents split up.
- Shit.

14:01.776 --> 14:04.365
Sorry, they couldn't
have waited three months?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.193
That's exactly what I said.

14:07.585 --> 14:08.935
You must've freaked out.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.937
- It's tough.
- Mm.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.735
Like, it-it totally sucks.

14:12.798 --> 14:15.148
I bet, but it must have made you

14:15.173 --> 14:17.175
even more excited to go to school.

14:17.378 --> 14:20.076
Yeah, that and a couple
of handles of vodka later,

14:20.391 --> 14:22.122
I was good to go.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.124
Did you do that whole frat thing
where you almost die

14:24.167 --> 14:25.858
from alcohol poisoning, too?

14:25.974 --> 14:27.976
Oh, God. Um...

14:29.781 --> 14:30.913
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.438
See, this is, this is why I'm into you:

14:34.722 --> 14:36.397
I like the way you look at things.

14:36.544 --> 14:38.503
You're so upbeat.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.815
- I think we should go swimming.
- What?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.779
- I-I don't have my suit...
- Uh, you know what? Neither do I,

14:44.840 --> 14:46.936
but that's what underwear's for.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.040
So, you said you were into me.

14:57.298 --> 14:58.865
It was just the vodka talking.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.544
You didn't have any vodka.

15:00.653 --> 15:02.089
Oh, shit.

15:02.245 --> 15:03.812
Hey.

15:03.930 --> 15:05.067
What was that for?

15:05.092 --> 15:07.269
Not just saying,
"Yeah, Dannie, I'm into you."

15:07.351 --> 15:10.317
Yes, Dannie. I'm into you.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.731
Fuck.

16:23.091 --> 16:25.877
What?

16:26.028 --> 16:28.248
- Are you... Are you ticklish?
- N-No.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.778
Is that, is that what's happening?

16:29.803 --> 16:31.085
- No, no, it's...
- No, no, no? Really?

16:31.109 --> 16:32.126
- You sure about that?
- No, stop.

16:32.151 --> 16:34.950
Stop, no! Stop. No, don't.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.039
Don't, don't, don't! Oh, oh!

16:37.249 --> 16:40.426
Stop! Stop, stop! No!

16:45.339 --> 16:48.037
Hey! Boy!

17:01.107 --> 17:03.413
Oh, fuck...

17:03.983 --> 17:06.898
Stop! Stop!

17:18.950 --> 17:21.387
Shit. I'm sorry.

18:36.643 --> 18:38.484
Man, I was hearing all last week

18:38.509 --> 18:40.030
that there might be layoffs.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.296
Yeah, me, too.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.149
Although, poker last night,

18:43.861 --> 18:45.540
Walsh says, "Looks like
we might be getting"

18:45.565 --> 18:47.200
a new order in from Vancouver."

18:47.256 --> 18:48.366
What?

18:48.398 --> 18:51.184
Bill told me.
He says to Walsh, "Hey, Walsh."

18:51.242 --> 18:53.916
"Last Wednesday, you were
having sex with your wife,

18:53.979 --> 18:55.460
"you left the curtains open.

18:55.527 --> 18:57.546
Whole neighborhood could
see you having sex."

18:57.654 --> 18:59.473
They're all laughing about it.

18:59.863 --> 19:02.014
Walsh is like, "Wait, what day?"

19:02.085 --> 19:03.695
He says, "Wednesday."

19:03.911 --> 19:05.872
Walsh says, "Oh, joke's on them."

19:05.952 --> 19:07.252
I wasn't home on Wednesday."

19:11.100 --> 19:13.494
What the fuck?

19:15.719 --> 19:17.721
Jesus.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.001
No guns. No casings.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.961
No body.

19:40.464 --> 19:43.007
Looks like whoever
was bleeding was dragged,

19:43.603 --> 19:44.998
loaded into the vehicle,

19:45.023 --> 19:47.004
which was then driven out that gate.

19:47.584 --> 19:48.946
Get a mold of the tracks.

19:48.977 --> 19:50.359
Measure the axle width.

19:50.388 --> 19:52.260
Looks like a cube truck, Chief.

19:52.376 --> 19:54.042
Make sure. Up there it looks like

19:54.067 --> 19:55.460
someone tried to wipe up the prints.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.299
Probably ran out
of nighttime, had to bail.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.045
Well, we got those
footprints over there.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.288
Those are from the two mill workers

20:00.313 --> 20:02.375
who found the scene this morning.

20:02.808 --> 20:04.090
It's human.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.506
Fuck.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.846
This much blood,
it's got to be a murder.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.268
Can tell you more in... four hours.

20:10.301 --> 20:11.868
- All right.
- Everything by overnight.

20:11.951 --> 20:13.604
Thanks for helping out.

20:13.895 --> 20:16.202
You want dogs to search for a body?

20:16.877 --> 20:18.979
Or bodies... this is a lot of blood.

20:19.127 --> 20:20.888
They probably can't get
to it till tomorrow,

20:20.913 --> 20:23.437
but ask those boys to
drag the river, huh?

20:23.494 --> 20:24.757
All right, Rook, you're with me.

20:24.782 --> 20:26.355
We're gonna talk to Bud Carl.

20:26.562 --> 20:29.043
- You ever met him?
- Me? Different planets.

20:29.107 --> 20:30.586
Know the family name, of course.

20:30.611 --> 20:31.891
Father opened the mill, right?

20:31.951 --> 20:35.041
Grandfather. He's number three.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.281
<i>What, on the mill grounds?</i>

20:39.553 --> 20:41.780
<i>I'll bet Bud isn't happy about that.</i>

20:41.990 --> 20:44.373
<i>Uh, they say
that they'll know more soon.</i>

20:44.417 --> 20:45.896
<i>I'll keep you updated.</i>

20:45.940 --> 20:48.824
<i>Ah, thanks for the heads-up.</i>

20:48.898 --> 20:50.454
<i>Well, right, yeah,
if the mill goes away,</i>

20:50.479 --> 20:52.268
<i>that would be great for us,</i>

20:52.293 --> 20:54.795
but crime is never good
for real estate.

20:55.191 --> 20:56.671
<i>We'll talk at the office.</i>

20:56.696 --> 20:58.538
<i>Uh, I can't come in to work today.</i>

20:58.586 --> 21:00.283
<i>What? Why not?</i>

21:01.565 --> 21:03.853
I have food poisoning or something.

21:03.928 --> 21:06.409
I-I can't leave the house.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.959
We had a shipment
go out, then shut down.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.828
Nobody was here after that.

21:32.888 --> 21:34.502
No security?

21:34.539 --> 21:36.559
Oh, geez. We haven't bothered

21:36.584 --> 21:37.896
to have a night guy for years.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.823
What are they gonna steal, the furnace?

21:39.848 --> 21:41.388
What time did the shipment go out, sir?

21:41.413 --> 21:43.328
About 10:15. Then I went home.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.525
I thought I was the last to go.

21:45.674 --> 21:48.590
Um, is that the usual time?

21:49.545 --> 21:51.144
It was a little late.

21:52.091 --> 21:55.150
There was a cancellation, last minute.

21:55.385 --> 21:57.159
The specs on one of the crates was off.

21:57.252 --> 21:59.033
You got any suspicion at all

21:59.058 --> 22:01.433
that maybe one of your workers
decided to take advantage

22:01.458 --> 22:04.331
of the mill being
so deserted down that end?

22:04.373 --> 22:06.287
- Like drugs and that?
- Yeah.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.256
I hear anything about that...

22:08.449 --> 22:11.119
- I... I call you.
- Right.

22:11.265 --> 22:13.078
Look, I'll help however I can.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.884
You want me to shut down the mill,

22:14.945 --> 22:16.462
the guys are gonna lose
a bunch of hours,

22:16.487 --> 22:19.115
- but I'll bank that furnace.
- Ah, thanks, Pop, but...

22:19.182 --> 22:20.822
shut you down for two days?

22:20.847 --> 22:22.815
Uh, cops are unpopular enough

22:22.840 --> 22:24.447
without taking bread
out of people's mouths.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.997
I don't know, I'll keep
my eyes and ears open.

22:27.934 --> 22:29.837
Somebody killed here.

22:33.568 --> 22:35.619
Figure out what happened, Chief.

22:36.237 --> 22:37.885
I intend to.

22:39.964 --> 22:41.272
Thank you for your time.

22:41.575 --> 22:43.446
Thank you, sir.

22:44.216 --> 22:45.956
Thank you, sir.

22:59.727 --> 23:01.287
Not surprised he got emotional.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.469
That's Bud, all right.

23:02.512 --> 23:04.079
You called him Pop.

23:04.163 --> 23:05.510
Just slipped out.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.254
All his workers call him Pop.

23:07.352 --> 23:09.223
Bud really cares about his people.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.999
Dogs are here, and the tire
tracks are from a cube truck.

23:12.188 --> 23:13.899
Put that out to our guys in the county.

23:13.924 --> 23:15.922
We are looking for a cube truck.

24:01.890 --> 24:03.224
That's Pop.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.783
Oh, here comes Pop.

24:06.744 --> 24:08.447
Hey, sorry, Pop, if we...

24:08.490 --> 24:10.536
Man, we didn't know what to do.

24:10.636 --> 24:12.462
We seen all that blood, we panicked.

24:12.487 --> 24:14.184
Hey. Yinz did the right thing.

24:14.314 --> 24:17.099
I don't give a fuck
how much trouble this causes.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.109
Listen up.

24:19.769 --> 24:21.407
This thing...

24:21.634 --> 24:23.457
it won't cost none of yinz a penny.

24:23.626 --> 24:25.237
All your jobs are safe.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.027
Promise you that.

24:28.731 --> 24:29.970
Thanks, Pop.

24:30.035 --> 24:32.170
Yeah. Sorry anyway, though.

24:32.206 --> 24:33.990
What'd the chief say, Pop?

24:34.653 --> 24:37.351
I don't know, Walsh.
What is there to say, huh?

24:37.797 --> 24:40.528
Fuckin' Walsh. Anybody's upset,

24:40.574 --> 24:41.854
I want to hear about it, okay?

24:41.896 --> 24:43.545
Yinz want to go home today?

24:43.754 --> 24:45.842
Nah, I didn't lose my lunch
before, I'll be fine.

24:45.929 --> 24:47.552
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Ah.

24:47.739 --> 24:48.792
Get out of here.

24:48.817 --> 24:50.210
Go on, go home.

24:50.235 --> 24:51.929
Here, here.

24:52.662 --> 24:54.316
Yeah, thanks, Pop.

24:54.654 --> 24:56.090
Here.

24:56.463 --> 24:57.800
Thanks, Pop.

24:58.149 --> 25:00.404
'Bout the boys on the floor, they okay?

25:00.458 --> 25:01.850
Yeah, everybody seems fine.

25:02.507 --> 25:04.869
You guys okay? Terri?

25:04.936 --> 25:06.322
Yeah, Pop.

25:08.130 --> 25:09.203
Garrett.

25:09.228 --> 25:10.664
You okay?

25:11.074 --> 25:13.157
Yeah, just another day to me.

25:17.878 --> 25:19.319
- Police department...
- Channel Five just said

25:19.343 --> 25:20.406
it's human blood.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.151
<i>What, does that
definitely make it murder?</i>

25:22.189 --> 25:24.844
<i>Did-did they use the word homicide?</i>

25:24.894 --> 25:26.831
<i>No. Just that a source</i>

25:26.856 --> 25:28.057
<i>or somebody at the police department</i>

25:28.081 --> 25:29.715
<i>said it's definitely human blood.</i>

25:29.740 --> 25:31.568
<i>All right, well, keep watch.</i>

25:31.593 --> 25:32.985
<i>I-I'll see you at the office tomorrow.</i>

25:33.010 --> 25:34.425
<i>I don't care if you're dying.</i>

25:34.450 --> 25:36.278
Oh, I'm-I'm really sorry
about this, Mr. Furlbee.

25:36.303 --> 25:38.033
I will definitely be there tomorrow.

25:38.244 --> 25:39.626
Please. Relax.

25:39.687 --> 25:41.776
God, you're so jumpy; it was a joke.

25:57.134 --> 25:58.878
Uh, Jake Noveer.

25:58.903 --> 26:02.277
Mr. Noveer, this is Wilson Furlbee.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.719
Furlbee Development.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.222
Mr. Furlbee, yeah, hi.

26:08.341 --> 26:11.300
You're a private investigator, right?

26:11.583 --> 26:12.925
Yeah, yeah.

26:12.998 --> 26:15.391
You catch wind of the day's drama?

26:16.441 --> 26:17.813
Uh, yeah.

26:17.838 --> 26:19.405
Well, crime scene at the mill.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.547
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

26:21.916 --> 26:23.551
Well, a-are you available?

26:23.626 --> 26:25.904
<i>You saved Dr. Evans a boatload
in his divorce, right?</i>

26:25.958 --> 26:28.967
I'm, uh, working a few
can-of-corn assignments, but...

26:28.992 --> 26:31.224
- yeah, I got time.
<i>- That's great.</i>

26:31.249 --> 26:32.760
Well, why don't you, uh, pop by?

26:32.785 --> 26:34.177
I'm-I'm at home today.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.076
Furlbee Estates,
you know where that is?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.985
I think so. Yeah.

26:43.465 --> 26:45.429
Do you want something?

26:50.162 --> 26:52.120
Mr. Harvard MBA.

26:52.225 --> 26:54.140
Wow.

26:54.165 --> 26:55.961
He only graduated college,
like, a month ago,

26:55.986 --> 26:58.511
so he's gonna work for,
like, two years and then go.

26:58.688 --> 27:01.233
It's nice of your dad
to hire such a cute guy.

27:01.462 --> 27:03.246
Wait, so would you have done more?

27:03.524 --> 27:06.445
Like, if a stranger in the
night hadn't knocked him out?

27:07.055 --> 27:09.536
- Julie, it's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.

27:09.899 --> 27:12.421
I mean, like, why was
this hooded vigilante

27:12.446 --> 27:15.069
wandering the country club
in the middle of the night?

27:15.176 --> 27:17.297
See? I am not making this up.

27:17.404 --> 27:19.104
There was some kind of murder
at the mill.

27:19.129 --> 27:21.697
Workers discovered it at, like,
5:00 this morning.

27:21.725 --> 27:24.032
Oh, my God, you think
somebody really got hurt?

27:24.241 --> 27:26.679
Yeah, there was a murder.

27:31.631 --> 27:32.980
Are you done?

27:33.738 --> 27:35.237
Yeah.

27:37.338 --> 27:39.340
So are we on for the party tonight?

27:39.405 --> 27:40.971
I don't have a costume.

27:41.121 --> 27:42.557
Not a problem.

27:42.595 --> 27:44.065
Take off your pants,
put on one of your dad's

27:44.097 --> 27:47.013
big white dress shirts and
you're ready.

27:47.335 --> 27:49.119
Tom Cruise in Risky Business.

27:51.306 --> 27:53.240
Now remind me again
of what you're going as?

27:53.287 --> 27:54.467
A big slut.

27:54.525 --> 27:56.353
Oh, my God, you don't
even need a costume.

27:56.418 --> 27:58.072
Hey, you know what?

28:05.366 --> 28:06.898
No, it's actually over, uh,

28:06.923 --> 28:08.013
6,000 square feet.

28:08.038 --> 28:09.475
Oh, no shit?

28:09.658 --> 28:12.984
Yeah, so can I get you, uh,
a bottle of water?

28:13.009 --> 28:15.127
I got flat, sparkling, I got kombucha.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.719
Spicket works.

28:16.870 --> 28:17.962
Spicket?

28:18.025 --> 28:19.374
Tap. Tap water's fine.

28:19.399 --> 28:20.661
Oh. Here.

28:20.789 --> 28:22.185
- Take it.
- Oh.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.848
Ah, where you building this?

28:25.960 --> 28:27.362
Well, nowhere yet.

28:27.413 --> 28:29.052
But it will happen.

28:30.260 --> 28:31.894
So...

28:32.821 --> 28:36.128
How do you feel about Bud Carl?

28:36.350 --> 28:38.221
Bud Carl? What about him?

28:38.499 --> 28:40.349
He employed your dad, right?

28:40.448 --> 28:41.542
My foster dad.

28:41.567 --> 28:43.569
Hmm. So, like everyone else,
y-you think, uh,

28:43.732 --> 28:45.647
he's a-a great guy.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.934
Great.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.759
Oh, you don't like him.

28:49.836 --> 28:51.446
Well, it's not Bud Carl's fault

28:51.471 --> 28:53.314
steel industry's in the shitter.

28:53.622 --> 28:55.363
But the workers Bud lets go?

28:56.057 --> 28:58.674
Their skin tends to look more
like mine than his.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.581
Oh.

29:01.256 --> 29:05.434
You know, I heard that you, uh,
were a great detective...

29:05.577 --> 29:07.509
that Chief TRASK loved you.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.413
So, what happened?

29:10.560 --> 29:12.010
I stopped loving him.

29:12.081 --> 29:13.384
Hmm.

29:13.438 --> 29:15.570
I also heard you've been known to,

29:15.681 --> 29:17.204
uh, sleep on the job.

29:17.229 --> 29:19.739
Hmm, sleeping on the job
and being tired on the job

29:19.764 --> 29:20.982
is two different things.

29:21.007 --> 29:23.045
Well, why are you so tired?
You working too hard?

29:23.070 --> 29:25.777
I wish. Me and sleep
never quite got along.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.699
You ever try melatonin?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.219
Uh-huh.

29:29.244 --> 29:31.009
- You don't do Ambien?
- What do you want to hire me for?

29:31.034 --> 29:32.399
What about yoga? Meditation?

29:32.431 --> 29:34.136
What's your interest in Bud Carl?

29:34.324 --> 29:36.728
Uh... well.

29:36.753 --> 29:38.482
A little bird told me that he's close

29:38.507 --> 29:41.268
to landing a big contract,
and I want to know, you know,

29:41.293 --> 29:42.707
I want to know a little
more about that.

29:42.732 --> 29:43.742
Okay.

29:43.767 --> 29:46.186
Like, with these murders on
the mill grounds and all.

29:46.211 --> 29:47.430
Is it still gonna happen?

29:47.737 --> 29:49.657
You know, is Carl in trouble?

29:49.682 --> 29:51.591
I want to know what's going on,
as it's going on,

29:51.616 --> 29:53.518
and I want to know what the police know

29:53.543 --> 29:55.371
as they know it.

29:55.449 --> 29:57.598
This got something to do with...

29:57.736 --> 29:58.867
Oh, see?

29:58.938 --> 30:01.310
Oh, uh, you're smart.

30:01.335 --> 30:04.761
Well, things don't go so good for Bud,

30:04.933 --> 30:07.271
I guess that would clear the way
for a city of condos.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.459
Uh, no. N-N-No,
this clears the way, uh,

30:09.523 --> 30:12.225
for a... it's for a future
for everybody.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.807
Listen, Mr. Furlbee.

30:15.342 --> 30:18.301
I ain't real keen
on taking sides in some...

30:18.599 --> 30:20.482
- white man turf war.
- Oh.

30:20.715 --> 30:22.611
But I do want to find out
what happened at the mill.

30:22.701 --> 30:24.311
Oh, well, that's great.

30:24.336 --> 30:28.091
So, for the time being,
our goals are aligned.

30:28.197 --> 30:29.677
Hmm?

30:29.788 --> 30:31.398
H-How much do you charge?

30:34.789 --> 30:36.568
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:37.137 --> 30:38.791
Thanks.

30:40.935 --> 30:44.479
Thanks for coming all
the way into the city.

30:44.935 --> 30:47.126
Didn't want to run into
your dad like this.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.963
So... you're thinking maybe
we should say something

30:52.988 --> 30:54.642
about last night?

30:55.093 --> 30:56.757
It was 4:00 in the morning.

30:56.876 --> 30:59.046
Where else was he coming from?

31:00.189 --> 31:02.805
Down the hill from the club somewhere?

31:03.337 --> 31:05.979
I guess he thought I was attacking you?

31:06.320 --> 31:07.885
I didn't even see him.

31:08.001 --> 31:09.859
Did you see his face?

31:10.625 --> 31:12.818
Not really, it was too dark.

31:14.929 --> 31:17.249
So then we don't have much to say then.

31:18.074 --> 31:19.859
I mean, what would we tell them?

31:19.948 --> 31:21.559
Some guy that we can't describe

31:21.584 --> 31:24.326
was out at 4:00 in the morning.

31:24.894 --> 31:27.071
How does that help them?

31:29.585 --> 31:31.012
Listen.

31:31.770 --> 31:35.295
I also wanted to say
that I had fun last night.

31:35.828 --> 31:37.669
Before I got knocked unconscious.

31:37.704 --> 31:39.349
Right.

31:40.026 --> 31:42.419
Do you want to hang out again?

31:42.542 --> 31:43.978
Maybe tonight?

31:44.163 --> 31:46.356
Promised my friend
I'd go to this party.

31:46.668 --> 31:49.819
"Dress as your favorite movie
character," or something.

31:50.183 --> 31:51.766
She'll kill me if I don't go.

31:51.804 --> 31:53.370
It's okay.

31:53.488 --> 31:55.011
No, you want to come with us?

31:55.036 --> 31:56.559
I would, you know,

31:56.584 --> 31:59.533
if my favorite
movie character was, like,

31:59.612 --> 32:01.098
a plate of ground beef.

32:01.177 --> 32:03.019
But...

32:04.531 --> 32:06.921
Listen, are you in a hurry to get back?

32:07.221 --> 32:09.849
I need to find some makeup
or foundation or whatever

32:09.874 --> 32:11.789
to cover this thing up.

32:17.398 --> 32:18.831
Hey, Tom.

32:20.445 --> 32:22.145
No, you're not.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.218
Who's that?

32:24.281 --> 32:25.780
He's a dick, pun intended.

32:25.858 --> 32:27.930
- He was a detective?
- Our only one.

32:27.983 --> 32:30.085
And a favorite of Trask's.

32:30.177 --> 32:32.353
Uh-uh. Not today, Jake.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.150
I can't handle you, not today.

32:34.175 --> 32:36.752
I'm here to officially inform
you as required by law,

32:36.854 --> 32:39.073
I've been hired to augment
the investigation.

32:39.204 --> 32:40.277
Who hired you?

32:40.302 --> 32:42.217
That, I don't have to tell you.

32:42.305 --> 32:43.979
As a professional courtesy,

32:44.049 --> 32:45.294
may I take a look at the scene?

32:45.319 --> 32:46.847
No, you may not.

32:47.401 --> 32:49.706
Please, uh, escort this
gentleman from the scene.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.610
Come on, Peter. I'll bring
you anything I find

32:51.650 --> 32:52.770
and you can have the credit for it.

32:52.794 --> 32:54.915
Sir, or should I say scumbag?

32:54.940 --> 32:56.475
- I prefer scumbag.
- Oh.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.280
- Peter, come on.
- Please follow me,

32:58.324 --> 33:00.527
sir, or I'll have
to kick you in the balls.

33:00.809 --> 33:02.518
I'm just trying to make a living.

33:06.768 --> 33:08.527
See you later, Tom.

33:11.352 --> 33:12.830
What a dick.

33:19.954 --> 33:23.088
Again? Feel like I never see you.

33:23.174 --> 33:24.300
Where you headed?

33:24.328 --> 33:25.718
I thought we were riding
to the party together.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.831
I'm gonna be gone in two months.

33:27.856 --> 33:30.206
Don't you want to get used to
not knowing every little thing

33:30.231 --> 33:31.841
about my life before I leave?

33:31.866 --> 33:33.650
You guys can spend some
alone time together.

33:33.675 --> 33:36.634
"Us guys," that is funny.

33:37.593 --> 33:38.880
Sorry.

33:41.569 --> 33:43.844
You want to go shopping?

33:43.970 --> 33:46.494
Just you and me, go into town,

33:46.571 --> 33:49.138
get me some stuff for school,
maybe some Mani-pedis?

33:49.483 --> 33:52.934
Are you trying to buy me off by
getting me to buy you clothes?

33:53.515 --> 33:55.517
Hey, it worked through high school.

33:55.682 --> 33:57.292
You mean last month?

34:03.328 --> 34:04.935
- Have fun.
- Okay.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.895
- Be careful.
- Careful?

34:06.920 --> 34:08.652
You should always be careful.

34:08.731 --> 34:10.014
Don't worry, Mom.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.866
I'm not gonna be found
dead in a steel mill.

34:11.911 --> 34:13.478
Oh, should I laugh at that?

34:13.574 --> 34:15.262
Why not?

34:15.795 --> 34:17.056
See you later, Beetlejuice.

34:17.100 --> 34:18.194
Bye.

34:46.030 --> 34:47.205
Garrett.

34:47.235 --> 34:48.454
- Hey.
- How's your little girl?

34:48.478 --> 34:49.827
- Oh, she's great.
- Huh.

34:49.851 --> 34:51.716
Yeah, she-she's been going
through these, like, obsessions.

34:51.739 --> 34:52.846
You know, uh... Ah.

34:52.879 --> 34:54.501
One-one week it's a stuffed elephant,

34:54.539 --> 34:56.585
next week it's fuckin' SpongeBob.

34:56.610 --> 34:57.959
Oh, God.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.495
Could never decide if I wanted
to kill that dude

34:59.519 --> 35:01.086
or get him to move in with us,
you know?

35:01.142 --> 35:02.317
- Yeah.
- Mm.

35:02.461 --> 35:03.679
Have you seen Rick?

35:04.266 --> 35:05.832
Uh, no.

35:06.564 --> 35:08.356
Fucker's supposed to take
his son fishing.

35:08.782 --> 35:10.044
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.

35:10.069 --> 35:11.838
- That's-that's tough.
- Oh.

35:11.881 --> 35:13.187
- Par for the course.
- Yeah.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.275
I'll see you around.

35:14.319 --> 35:15.794
See you, Terri.

35:36.019 --> 35:37.128
When you need me,

35:37.153 --> 35:38.865
you throw me out, but when
you're done with me,

35:38.908 --> 35:40.127
you bring me back.

35:40.246 --> 35:41.650
What am I?

35:41.794 --> 35:43.130
It's an anchor.

35:43.174 --> 35:44.523
Hey, thanks, Robyn.

35:44.566 --> 35:46.296
You're out after one?

35:46.568 --> 35:48.719
I used to have to cut you off
at least twice a week.

35:48.833 --> 35:49.893
It's cool.

35:49.923 --> 35:52.014
My cousin used to get
annihilated all the time

35:52.064 --> 35:53.718
just to prove he was in control.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.797
Called it a shot a day
to keep the devil away.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.399
Whatever you want to call it.

36:22.604 --> 36:23.946
Look at this handsome guy.

36:24.046 --> 36:25.825
Favorite movie.

36:26.328 --> 36:27.783
Refreshments are that way.

36:28.345 --> 36:29.614
Now the party can begin.

36:29.639 --> 36:31.111
Hey, hey, hey. Come here, come here.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.977
Don't drink that shit.

36:33.021 --> 36:34.590
I'll show you the good stuff.

36:34.983 --> 36:37.393
Thanks so much for inviting me, Abatsy.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.149
Where are you?

36:40.293 --> 36:41.730
What do you mean? I'm right here.

36:41.810 --> 36:42.863
Barely.

36:42.906 --> 36:45.800
I just... I feel weird about
not going to the police.

36:46.119 --> 36:48.367
You guys agreed you wouldn't, so...

36:50.373 --> 36:51.809
What?

36:52.262 --> 36:54.178
What is it?

36:54.933 --> 36:56.180
I saw him.

36:56.490 --> 36:57.834
What? What do you mean?

36:58.438 --> 37:00.058
The guy, I-I did see him.

37:00.198 --> 37:01.403
I got a pretty good look at him.

37:01.447 --> 37:04.330
Holy shit, Dannie. You didn't tell Ty?

37:04.370 --> 37:06.469
He thought he was helping me;
he thought I was being attacked.

37:06.494 --> 37:08.822
Maybe he was just, like,
passing by, you know?

37:09.238 --> 37:11.414
- In the middle of the night?
- I don't know,

37:11.439 --> 37:13.705
the country club isn't
that close to the mill.

37:14.463 --> 37:16.160
Okay, look.

37:16.699 --> 37:18.220
So, here's the mill,

37:18.245 --> 37:19.963
where all the blood
was found, and, then,

37:20.002 --> 37:22.196
here's where the country club pool is.

37:22.221 --> 37:25.219
Yeah, but if he lives in Braden West,

37:25.244 --> 37:26.729
then he would have taken Crescent Road

37:26.754 --> 37:28.778
and been nowhere near the mill, so...

37:29.081 --> 37:30.762
Unless he didn't want to be seen,

37:30.787 --> 37:32.491
in which case he
would have taken the fire road.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.010
Look, it goes right
by the country club.

37:34.049 --> 37:36.490
- What time did he attack you guys?
- He didn't attack us.

37:36.569 --> 37:38.092
Just Ty, and that's...

37:38.380 --> 37:40.013
- He thought Ty was...
- No, wh-whatever.

37:40.038 --> 37:41.431
Like, when did it happen?

37:42.688 --> 37:47.182
4:15. But the scene wasn't
discovered until 5:00 a.m.

37:47.233 --> 37:48.934
What are you saying,
this guy murdered someone,

37:48.959 --> 37:50.483
then tried to rescue you?

37:50.565 --> 37:51.722
He had a dog, too.

37:51.747 --> 37:54.435
- It was a brown mutt.
- You left that out, too?

37:54.520 --> 37:56.537
- Jesus, D.
- What?

37:56.562 --> 37:57.650
It's a small town, Dannie;

37:57.675 --> 37:59.285
they'll be able to
figure out who it was.

38:01.951 --> 38:05.075
Okay. Yeah, I'll-I'll go
to the police tomorrow morning.

38:05.441 --> 38:07.191
Heads up.

38:12.203 --> 38:13.502
My parents are here.

38:13.736 --> 38:15.149
Oh. H-Hey.

38:15.188 --> 38:17.697
I just can't handle seeing them
play the happy couple tonight.

38:17.740 --> 38:18.915
We got to go.

38:19.148 --> 38:21.048
What about the cute guys?

38:21.274 --> 38:23.244
- Julie.
- Fine.

38:23.490 --> 38:25.492
It's an old people's party, anyway.

38:38.497 --> 38:39.815
Garrett, I'm telling you,

38:39.840 --> 38:42.619
- I got to...
- Hey, uh... this, uh...

38:43.003 --> 38:45.005
this ought to catch me up.

38:45.449 --> 38:46.668
Yeah.

38:46.726 --> 38:48.902
So, look, let me know if it don't.

38:49.052 --> 38:50.904
No. I'm good, man. Thank you.

38:51.213 --> 38:52.824
I'll get her.

38:59.819 --> 39:00.886
Here you go.

39:00.973 --> 39:02.213
Hi.

39:02.672 --> 39:05.266
Hey, you got a cookie there?

39:05.487 --> 39:07.181
Want to walk?

39:09.112 --> 39:11.332
Yeah, let's go for a ride.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.313
Here we go.

39:26.452 --> 39:28.289
You know your parents
have gotten into a fight

39:28.332 --> 39:30.160
and have probably left by now.

39:30.419 --> 39:32.696
We're not going back.

39:33.693 --> 39:36.696
Um, where are we going?

39:42.650 --> 39:44.740
That... that's the dog.

39:47.467 --> 39:48.598
What?

39:48.664 --> 39:50.659
That's the dog.

39:52.132 --> 39:53.619
That's the guy.

39:55.062 --> 39:56.983
Stop. I want to see.

40:01.006 --> 40:02.366
He's hot.

40:03.053 --> 40:04.673
Definitely from the west side of town.

40:04.717 --> 40:06.066
Yinzer, for sure.

40:07.189 --> 40:08.256
What?

40:08.315 --> 40:10.123
Not saying he's a criminal.

40:10.532 --> 40:12.384
That's what you're saying.

40:37.433 --> 40:38.486
Hi.

40:38.527 --> 40:39.593
- Hi!
- Hi!

40:39.618 --> 40:41.054
You guys look beautiful.

40:41.079 --> 40:42.733
Sexy Laurel and Hardy.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.182
- That's not a bad thing.
- Where are your pants?

40:45.219 --> 40:46.556
They're-they're here;
they're just small.

40:46.580 --> 40:48.211
- Yeah. Cute.
- Cheers.

40:48.236 --> 40:49.666
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:49.691 --> 40:52.085
- I'm glad we made it.
- Yes.

40:53.372 --> 40:55.202
You still have to
tell me about that vacation.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.535
- It was amazing.
- It was terrific.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.589
- Yeah?
- Two weeks,

40:57.614 --> 40:59.373
circled through the
west; it was wonderful.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.929
Yeah, we saw Mount Rushmore
and the Grand Canyon...

41:02.486 --> 41:03.803
- Yellowstone.
- Yellowstone.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.395
Yes, and the Badlands.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.644
Badlands. Uh, I want
to see those pictures.

41:07.688 --> 41:09.584
- Sure, for sure.
- Okay.

41:19.322 --> 41:22.156
- Now?
- I gotta get moving.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.710
Okay.

41:25.174 --> 41:26.601
Not here.

41:27.582 --> 41:29.650
Meet me, uh, behind the garage
in ten minutes.

41:29.799 --> 41:31.410
All right.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.212
You got beat up?

42:22.395 --> 42:24.882
None of this makes it
back to us, right?

42:28.221 --> 42:30.311
I'm insulted you'd even ask.

42:31.518 --> 42:33.118
As promised.

42:33.852 --> 42:35.593
Enjoy Belize.

42:35.663 --> 42:37.012
You bet.

42:37.828 --> 42:40.119
I never want to see your face again.

42:52.273 --> 42:54.756
- What have we here?
- Oh! There he is.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.133
Rand, tell them

42:56.158 --> 42:59.020
the story about when you
got stuck on a tropical island

42:59.065 --> 43:00.664
- by yourself.
- Stuck? What're you talking about?

43:00.688 --> 43:01.789
It was the greatest week of my life.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.424
Come on, tell them the whole story.

43:03.472 --> 43:05.160
So, I'm dating this advertising exec.

43:05.185 --> 43:07.686
She's got her pilot's license
and a private plane.

43:08.048 --> 43:10.745
The perks of dating a pilot
are the weekend getaways.

43:10.824 --> 43:14.273
Downside is getting dumped
and stranded on those getaways.

43:16.037 --> 43:17.090
For a week!

43:17.115 --> 43:19.988
- We feel so sorry for you.
- He never recovered.

43:21.217 --> 43:23.420
I bet it was one of those steelworkers.

43:23.523 --> 43:25.178
Who died or who killed someone?

43:25.267 --> 43:27.661
You know, you know,
the class-envy thing.

43:27.977 --> 43:31.752
Some jaded yinzer ex-coal miner.

43:32.505 --> 43:34.056
Maybe it was a ghost.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.058
I did see a driverless car go by today.

43:59.875 --> 44:01.779
So, Brokeback.

44:01.955 --> 44:03.717
That's, like,
pretty progressive for him.

44:03.778 --> 44:06.389
Mm. He didn't watch it.

44:07.046 --> 44:10.440
He thinks he's Jon Voigt.

44:10.912 --> 44:13.001
Oh.

44:38.991 --> 44:41.338
What is the problem, Officers?

44:41.392 --> 44:44.972
Well, Crescent Road is not your
personal parking lot, buddy.

44:44.997 --> 44:46.945
Sorry, Mr. Abatsy,
but without a permit,

44:46.970 --> 44:48.644
- we're gonna have to ask your guests...
- Of course.

44:48.668 --> 44:51.329
Let's go inside, grab a bite to eat,

44:51.589 --> 44:54.036
and we can get these cars
moved right away.

44:54.096 --> 44:55.403
I've got two valets.

44:55.448 --> 44:58.712
They'll get 'em all
out of here, lickity-split.

44:59.095 --> 45:01.837
Hey, can you turn it up? The TV?

45:03.354 --> 45:04.765
We, uh...

45:04.818 --> 45:07.429
we've gotten more information
from the lab.

45:07.586 --> 45:10.312
Earlier they said
it was definitely human blood,

45:10.398 --> 45:13.874
but just now,
they can tell from the antigens,

45:14.402 --> 45:16.178
it appears that there are

45:16.244 --> 45:18.735
seven different kinds of blood
at the scene.

45:18.793 --> 45:20.366
Had to announce it
during my party, huh?

45:20.402 --> 45:22.035
Obviously, this presents

45:22.060 --> 45:26.804
a much more complex situation
than we initially imagined.

45:27.466 --> 45:29.424
One that we have to get right,

45:29.695 --> 45:32.698
and one that will require
some more time.

45:33.306 --> 45:34.563
So at this moment,

45:34.588 --> 45:35.937
this is all we can disclose,

45:35.963 --> 45:38.621
as our forensic experts
continue to analyze

45:38.646 --> 45:41.475
and make determinations
that are more definitive.

45:41.611 --> 45:43.700
So what we might have here

45:44.011 --> 45:46.871
is blood from seven different people.

45:47.834 --> 45:49.092
Seven... seven murders.

45:49.163 --> 45:50.643
Thank you.

45:52.761 --> 45:54.154
Let's party, people.

45:54.210 --> 45:55.342
Let's keep dancing.

46:04.569 --> 46:06.349
Garrett. Wanna chill?

46:06.688 --> 46:07.953
Marty has the key to Chuck E. Cheese,

46:07.978 --> 46:09.473
and we got a little something.

46:09.772 --> 46:11.948
- Yinz know what time it is?
- Yeah, like, 11:30.

46:11.973 --> 46:13.496
Stop being a pussy.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.316
We haven't hung out
since we got back from school.

46:15.347 --> 46:16.870
Get out of here.

46:17.401 --> 46:19.586
What's your problem, Garrett?

46:19.656 --> 46:20.767
Why are you being an asshole?

46:20.792 --> 46:22.214
Get the fuck out of here right now.

46:22.303 --> 46:24.881
You come back again and
wake up my daughter,

46:24.906 --> 46:26.516
I will slap that fucking grin
off your face.

46:26.541 --> 46:27.915
Daughter? Since when do you

46:27.939 --> 46:29.419
have a daughter?

46:44.361 --> 46:47.060
The man who made it doesn't want it.

46:47.498 --> 46:48.801
The man who bought it

46:48.826 --> 46:50.218
doesn't need it.

46:50.271 --> 46:52.491
The man who needs it...

46:52.814 --> 46:54.633
he doesn't know it.

46:55.085 --> 46:56.870
What is it?

46:59.273 --> 47:02.611
- You can close me out, please.
- $14.

47:10.799 --> 47:13.019
- You want all ones?
- Nope.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.067
Stingy motherfucker.

47:28.464 --> 47:30.031
Here you go.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.589
Thanks.

47:41.672 --> 47:42.956
Yep.

47:47.266 --> 47:48.650
It's a coffin.
