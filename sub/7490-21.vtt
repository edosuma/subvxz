WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:11.250
Hey, hey, stop!

00:13.875 --> 00:17.000
- What was that?
- The Atomic Claw.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.041
Whoo!

00:18.125 --> 00:19.667
That is not a martial arts move.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.750
It's an appetizer at the lobster barn.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.709
It's a pro wrestling move, dude.

00:23.792 --> 00:24.709
You know who uses it?

00:25.083 --> 00:26.959
I'm gonna take a wild guess
and go with the wrestler

00:27.041 --> 00:28.625
called the Atomic Claw.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.208
You know wrestling's fake, right?

00:31.667 --> 00:33.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33.417 --> 00:35.583
There is nothing fake
about the Klaus Claw, okay?

00:35.667 --> 00:36.875
It's 100 percent bionic

00:36.959 --> 00:39.792
with robotic titanium fingers
that can crush a man's skull.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.250
It's a catcher's mitt
wrapped in aluminum foil.

00:44.959 --> 00:48.041
So, uh, I guess you guys aren't going
to the Wrestle Frenzy this weekend.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.417
- Of course, we're going.
- We wouldn't miss it.

00:52.417 --> 00:53.750
Can we get back to sparring?

00:54.125 --> 00:54.959
Let's go.

00:55.959 --> 00:56.959
All right, you ready?

00:57.083 --> 00:58.208
Go! Nice.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.125
Whoa!

01:01.667 --> 01:03.667
What are you doing? Stop!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.667
That is crossing the line, dude.

01:06.750 --> 01:09.166
You do not touch another man's ears. Ever.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.375
What are you guys doing?

01:11.792 --> 01:15.375
He gave me the Atomic Claw,
so I gave him the Russian Lobe Lock.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.875
Wait. So I go into my office
for ten minutes,

01:17.875 --> 01:19.333
and you guys just goof off?

01:19.417 --> 01:21.208
Sorry, Rudy.

01:21.291 --> 01:23.250
We're just pumped
about Wrestle Frenzy coming to town.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.625
What is it with you kids
and this wrestling stuff?

01:25.709 --> 01:28.667
If I wanted to see giant, sweaty freaks
pounding on each other,

01:28.750 --> 01:30.000
I'd go home for thanksgiving.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.417
I don't need this today.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.125
- What happened?
- Oh, I don't know. Let me see.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.875
My cat needs feline braces,

01:36.959 --> 01:38.875
and I had to help my mother's man friend

01:38.959 --> 01:41.041
because his nose was stuck
in a bowling ball.

01:42.083 --> 01:42.917
How do you get--

01:43.000 --> 01:45.250
By playing a game
called "I Bet I Can Fit My Nose in That."

01:47.625 --> 01:50.750

02:30.875 --> 02:33.041
I loved the museum.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.083
But the prehistoric display was lame.

02:35.166 --> 02:38.291
You could tell the cavemen
were just department store mannequins.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.709
That explains why the Neanderthals
were wearing high heels.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.709
Holding hands with you at the museum
is nice.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.041
About that,

02:52.500 --> 02:57.291
I was thinking it's time for us
to go to the next level.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.291
I think we're doing good.

03:04.709 --> 03:07.625
And my friend Annie told me
the next level is scary at first,

03:07.667 --> 03:09.583
- but then it's really fun.
- Mm-hm.

03:10.792 --> 03:13.709
Yeah, that's... Oh, boy.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.792
Am I late for my dentist thing?

03:15.875 --> 03:16.834
I got... Bye.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.750
Oh, excuse me.
- Milton?

03:22.291 --> 03:23.166
Milton!

03:29.834 --> 03:32.667
Uh, excuse me. I was here before you.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.959
And now you're after me, pipsqueak.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.750
Hey, buddy, uh...

03:44.500 --> 03:45.750
I'm kind of having a tough day.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.333
I just wanna get my food,

03:47.417 --> 03:49.417
go home, put my cat in his headgear,

03:49.542 --> 03:51.500
and keep an eye
on my mom's boyfriend's nose.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.000
It's a life.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.125
Hey, you know what--

04:03.291 --> 04:05.333
You just made a big mistake, man.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.834
Rudy, what happened?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.834
I, I don't know. I just lost it.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.709
He shoved me and called me a pipsqueak.

04:16.375 --> 04:18.542
Don't worry, Rudy. You're not alone.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.458
My pip squeaks, too.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.625
I'm not talking about my pip with you.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

04:28.417 --> 04:30.792
Dude, the next level.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.166
She's talking about kissing, bro.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.542
I can't. I'm not ready.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.250
It's not that big a deal.

04:38.583 --> 04:42.041
You just have to relax
and let nature take over.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.458
How do you know?

04:43.542 --> 04:46.959
The only thing you ever planted one on
was the punching dummy at the dojo.

04:48.875 --> 04:51.709
And I relaxed and let nature take over.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.917
Milton, dude.

04:55.375 --> 04:56.917
Your first one's important, man.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.667
Well, it's not technically my first one.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.250
Thanks for coming
to my birthday party, Cindy.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.125
So I guess I'll see you around.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.291
Aunt Gerty.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.291
Happy birthday, darling.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.750
See you next year.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.875
Oh, he kissed me right on the mouth!

05:30.959 --> 05:33.750
No. No, it wasn't like that.
You turned into it, and I missed.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.917
You're a twisted little boy!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.500
The whole thing was horrible.

05:38.041 --> 05:41.083
I tasted her lipstick
and cough drops for three weeks.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.250
-
- Guys, you are not gonna believe this.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.250
That wrestler Mondo Mountain is in town.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.291
He was in Falafel Phil's
and apparently, he met Rudy.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.417
- Get out of here!
- No way!

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Whoa!

05:56.834 --> 06:01.041
Rudy says martial arts is for confidence,
discipline and honor.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.792
But as it turns out,

06:02.875 --> 06:05.166
it's also good for beating down fools.

06:08.792 --> 06:11.333
What's a guy gotta do
to get some up top around here?

06:14.125 --> 06:17.875
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy,
you have well over three million hits.

06:18.375 --> 06:21.208
I can't believe it.
That's more than "Man Kisses Goat."

06:21.750 --> 06:24.667
Hey, I didn't kiss her.
She needed mouth-to-mouth.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.291
Rudy, why didn't you tell us
you took down the Mountain?

06:31.375 --> 06:32.917
Your video's all over the internet.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.291
Yeah, Rudy, you're famous.

06:34.417 --> 06:37.333
I know. Today, a woman asked me
to sign her baby.

06:37.417 --> 06:39.583
Do you know how much
that thing is worth now?

06:43.333 --> 06:44.667
That's me. Hello.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.750
Rudy, I wasn't there,

06:47.834 --> 06:49.792
but you've always taught us
not to use martial arts

06:49.875 --> 06:51.291
unless you absolutely have to.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.542
Oh, no, no, I had to.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.417
That giant jerk cut in front of me.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.834
So what you're saying is sometimes,
you have to take a stand?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.959
Yes. Uh, but I didn't just take a stand
for myself.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.583
I was taking a stand for every little guy

07:03.667 --> 07:07.959
that's ever been pushed around
by a fat cat or a big wig.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.792
Or a big fat cat in a wig.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.917
Yes, yes, he'll do it.
- Or a cat with--

07:13.000 --> 07:15.583
Rowdy Rudy will fight Mondo Mountain.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.041
<i>Okay, ciao, baby.</i>

07:18.542 --> 07:20.083
So you guys need more hummus or anything?

07:20.166 --> 07:21.166
Phil!

07:21.250 --> 07:22.458
What did you just do?

07:22.959 --> 07:24.792
I called the Wrestle Frenzy people

07:24.875 --> 07:28.333
and told them that you wanted to
get into the ring with The Mondo.

07:28.417 --> 07:31.709
What? No. I am not a pro wrestler.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.041
Don't worry. It's just a show.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.375
They want you to win.

07:35.458 --> 07:39.417
They want to see the mighty mouse
once again take down the elephant.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.208
Phil, Phil, I...

07:42.291 --> 07:43.709
I don't crave the spotlight.

07:43.792 --> 07:46.125
- Hmm.
- I'm but a simple man

07:46.208 --> 07:47.750
who lives a quiet life.

07:48.291 --> 07:51.083
- I don't seek fame--
- They say that they will pay you $5,000.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.250
Mondo's going down, baby!

07:59.166 --> 08:02.208
Julie, you know the other day
in Falafel Phil's

08:02.291 --> 08:05.750
when you told me
you wanted to go to the next level?

08:05.834 --> 08:07.458
Yeah, I'm excited.

08:07.834 --> 08:08.834
Okay.

08:09.125 --> 08:12.083
Well, it's obviously
very important to you,

08:12.166 --> 08:14.458
so I think we should do it.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.959
Just close your eyes as I prepare myself.

08:19.041 --> 08:19.917
Uh...

08:20.000 --> 08:21.542
Just do it. It's for the best.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.041
You're a twisted little boy!

08:36.250 --> 08:38.834
Gerty, no!

08:38.917 --> 08:40.917

08:43.333 --> 08:45.000
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

08:45.083 --> 08:48.750

Who wants to get flipped by Rowdy Rudy

08:48.834 --> 08:50.583
the Internet sensation?

08:54.875 --> 08:55.792
Ugh!

08:56.583 --> 08:57.500
There you go.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.291
Rudy! Rudy, I need to talk to you.

09:00.375 --> 09:04.250
Uh, Kim, I'm kind of in the middle
of throwing people around for money here.

09:05.792 --> 09:08.125
Fine. I just thought I'd let you know

09:08.500 --> 09:10.959
Jack's gonna miss class today
because he's in detention.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.291
What? Why?

09:13.834 --> 09:16.000
He got into a fight with a kid at school
and flipped him,

09:16.083 --> 09:17.458
just like you did to Mondo.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.583
What? I told you guys
to never fight at school.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.750
Yeah, well, the kids are saying
he went "all Rudy" on him.

09:23.458 --> 09:27.208
Wait, so now going "all Rudy"
means you beat someone up?

09:27.291 --> 09:29.291
Yeah, what did it used to mean?

09:29.375 --> 09:33.875
Oh, you know, losing your gym shorts
during a volleyball match.

09:37.625 --> 09:41.208
<i>Jack, where did you get the idea
that I think violence is okay?</i>

09:41.667 --> 09:43.458
Oh, I don't know, "Rowdy Rudy."

09:44.875 --> 09:45.834
What?

09:45.917 --> 09:48.375
I'm just choosing a costume
for Wrestle Frenzy.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.250
Look, I tell you guys all the time,

09:51.333 --> 09:53.375
it's never okay to fight in school.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.417
I saw a big guy picking on a nerd,
so I gave him a little shove.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.417
Did he hit the guy?

09:57.500 --> 09:59.625
No, but he kicked over his tuba case.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.166
So that made it okay for you to shove him?

10:02.250 --> 10:05.291
Rudy, I was just taking a stand
like you did with Mondo.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.750
No, no. Your situation
is completely different.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.125
Yeah, you're right.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.792
I was protecting someone
that really needed help.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.250
And you didn't like cutsies.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.875
Nobody likes cutsies.
They're worse than takesies-backsies.

10:18.667 --> 10:21.000
So you say one thing and do another?

10:21.458 --> 10:22.667
You're a hypocrite.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.792
How dare you!

10:26.875 --> 10:29.667
I am your Sensei and I deserve respect.

10:31.417 --> 10:33.667
Oh, great. Now I got a run in my tights.

10:35.458 --> 10:36.625
What happened with Jack?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.291
He's mad because he got in a fight
at school

10:39.375 --> 10:41.959
and thinks it's the same as what happened
to me in Falafel Phil's.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.125
Well, isn't it?

10:43.208 --> 10:45.250
No, it's completely different.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.750

I'm being a hypocrite?

11:01.667 --> 11:02.750
Oh, yeah, totally.

on a place that my doctor thinks
may be a third nipple.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.333
I can help you.
Meet me at the dojo at 3:30.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.458
Yeah, I've got some fruit flies in the lab

11:52.542 --> 11:54.875
that'll be livid if I don't show up
with a rotten plum.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.709
- Milton.
- 3:30 will work.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.875
- I got your text, Rudy. What's up?
-

12:09.875 --> 12:12.709
Jack, I've made some mistakes in my life.

12:12.792 --> 12:15.667
Sushi flavored toothpaste, pet toupees.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.583
Don't forget "man-ty" hose.

12:17.667 --> 12:20.583
No, no, that was a great idea.
Just a bad name.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.750
I should have called them
"Stockings for Dudes."

12:24.125 --> 12:25.125
What do you want, Rudy?

12:25.959 --> 12:27.458
I wanted to apologize, Jack.

12:28.875 --> 12:29.709
Look.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.250
You were right.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.792
I was being a hypocrite.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.250
Fighting should always be the last resort.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.166
Thanks, Rudy.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.333
Wait, why did I have to come down here
for you to tell me that?

12:41.417 --> 12:43.041
'Cause I'm gonna make things right.

12:43.959 --> 12:45.125
Mondo!

12:48.667 --> 12:49.625
What do you want?

12:50.125 --> 12:51.417
I have a proposal.

12:51.792 --> 12:54.959
We both know this match tomorrow is fake
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.083
I'm supposed to win,
but I want you to win instead.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.250
Why do you wanna do that?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.125
'Cause I crossed the line the other day.

13:02.542 --> 13:04.625
Phil's food is not worth fighting over.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.083
You know, it's a bad sign
when you walk in the bathroom

13:07.166 --> 13:09.083
and see a cockroach
throwing up in the toilet.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.041
You made me look like an idiot
on the internet.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.458
My rabbi saw that!

13:17.166 --> 13:18.458
I'm sorry about everything.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.375
I embarrassed you
and I sent a bad message to my students.

13:21.834 --> 13:24.709
If that's what you want,
then that's what we'll do.

13:27.375 --> 13:28.709
That's pretty cool, Rudy.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.750
Oh, uh, let's not ruin the show
for the guys.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.208
We'll just keep this our secret.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.417
You mean like how you wax your chest
every Wednesday night?

13:36.083 --> 13:38.208
Wait. How'd you know about that?

13:38.667 --> 13:41.959
It's a combination of the screams
and the way the toilet backs up

13:42.041 --> 13:43.583
'cause it's full of wax and hair.

13:45.417 --> 13:46.875
We'll see you tomorrow, Mondo.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.083
Let's give 'em a good show.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.291
Okay.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.208
Oh, it's gonna be a good show.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.417
I'm gonna rip off his face
and show it to his butt.

13:57.709 --> 13:58.750
That doesn't make any sense.

13:58.834 --> 14:00.000
- Shut it!
-

14:03.000 --> 14:04.625
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

14:06.417 --> 14:07.375
I can't do it.

14:07.458 --> 14:08.917
- You can do it.
- I can't.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.375
It's just a picture.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.500
Every time I pucker, I see Gerty.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.458
- It's hopeless.
- It's not hopeless.

14:15.542 --> 14:18.625
We'll just take it slowly,
like, uh, getting into a hot tub.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.458
I don't get into hot tubs.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.625
They're bubbling cauldrons of bacteria.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.291
For the love of... it's just a stupid...

14:28.291 --> 14:30.500
Oh, wow, what did we just do?

14:32.750 --> 14:35.792
Milton David Krupnick, you and Kim?

14:36.291 --> 14:38.250
Uh, no, Julie,
I think you have the wrong...

14:40.500 --> 14:43.709
Julie, no, Kim was just kissing me
to see if I'd like it.

14:43.792 --> 14:44.625
And I did.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.083
No, no, no, Julie,
it's not what you think, okay?

14:49.542 --> 14:51.792
Milton was nervous because he knew
you wanted to kiss him,

14:51.875 --> 14:54.166
and he wanted your first kiss
to be perfect.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.917
Yes, and I didn't wanna ruin things
by vomiting on your shoes.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.041
This was never about me, Julie.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.750
This was all about you.

15:07.667 --> 15:11.291
Milton, where did you get the idea
that I wanted you to kiss me?

15:11.875 --> 15:14.041
You said you wanted to go
to the next level.

15:14.125 --> 15:17.000
I was talking
about the upper level of the museum.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.000
What?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.083
But you said it would be scary at first,

15:22.166 --> 15:23.333
and then it would be fun.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.583
Yeah, because after you get off
the elevator,

15:25.667 --> 15:27.542
the first thing you see
is the mummy exhibit.

15:27.625 --> 15:29.458
-
But if you keep going,

15:29.542 --> 15:32.792
there's a simulator that lets you travel
through the human digestive tract.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.083
I heard about that.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.667
It's a magical journey
from mastication to evacuation.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.959
That's one wild ride
I wanna take with you.

15:45.375 --> 15:46.750
Oh, Milton.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.667
And about the other thing,
we don't need to rush.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.542
When we're ready, it'll happen.

15:53.458 --> 15:54.625
Thanks, Julie.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.875
Let's go get a smoothie.

15:57.667 --> 15:58.792
Just, just a second.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.625
Kim, thanks for helping Milton.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.750
I know you're a black belt...

16:07.125 --> 16:10.125
but if your lips get anywhere
near my man ever again,

16:10.208 --> 16:11.792
I will end you, sister.

16:13.750 --> 16:14.959
Got it.

16:15.792 --> 16:16.709
Bye-bye.

These guys are sweating all over us.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.500
I caught one of his teeth in my snow cone.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.750
Hello, everybody, I'm Jason Sehorn.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.583
And I used to play in the NFL,

16:53.667 --> 16:55.333
and now I'm here

16:55.417 --> 16:58.625
as your celebrity wrestling announcer
in Seafood.

16:58.709 --> 17:00.625
- Seaford!
- Don't care.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.583
And now into the ring,

17:03.917 --> 17:07.417
he's mad, he's mean, he's Mondo Mountain!

17:16.792 --> 17:19.875
The Internet phenomenon,
the mighty mouse that roared,

17:20.291 --> 17:22.291
the Sensei sensation,

17:22.792 --> 17:24.792
Rowdy Rudy!

17:31.458 --> 17:35.750
That's right. Rowdy Rudy is here
to bring the pain, baby.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.542
Oh! My bad. My bad.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.834
Walk it off. Walk it off.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.458
Hey, so I've seen these things.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.333
I think we should do a little smack talk.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.208
I'm gonna say something about your mama
that I in no way mean.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.625
Your mama is so big--

17:58.709 --> 17:59.875
Mondo, buddy.

18:00.542 --> 18:01.458
I kind of felt that one.

18:01.542 --> 18:03.000
Maybe we can lighten it up a little bit.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.583
- I'm sorry.
-

18:04.667 --> 18:05.709
- Oh!
-

18:06.542 --> 18:08.125
- How was that?
- Not good.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.875
I think I just peed into my lungs.

18:11.709 --> 18:12.792
Oh!

18:13.583 --> 18:15.959
I knew I shouldn't have kept my car keys
in my pocket.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.583
And that can opener, that was just stupid.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.917
Come on, Mondo!

18:23.000 --> 18:24.750
Rip his leg off and kick him with it.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.208
- I heard that, Jerry.
- Sorry, Rudy.

18:27.625 --> 18:28.917
Ow!

18:29.750 --> 18:31.792
I'd really appreciate it
if you'd stop that.

18:32.625 --> 18:33.959
I really don't bend that way!

18:42.875 --> 18:46.625
No!

18:49.542 --> 18:50.875
Oh!

18:52.041 --> 18:55.000
But, mommy,
I don't wanna go to school today.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.000
Guys, something's not right.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.750
This is what you get for embarrassing me.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.000
Oh, Mongo, now!

19:05.083 --> 19:07.291
Mondo's brother Mongo
is coming from the locker room.

19:13.709 --> 19:14.834
Oh!

19:17.250 --> 19:18.083
Whoo!

19:18.166 --> 19:19.000
All right, Rudy.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.375
We got this.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.083
Huh?

19:54.583 --> 19:55.417
Thanks, Jack.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.542
You saved me.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.875
Sometimes, you do have
to take a stand, Rudy.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.458
And the winner is Rowdy Rudy!

20:03.875 --> 20:06.458
Uh, people, people,
I have something to say.

20:06.834 --> 20:07.667
All right?

20:07.750 --> 20:09.625
If you have a disagreement with someone,

20:09.709 --> 20:12.166
try to work it out
without resorting to violence.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.625
Violence is never the answer.

20:14.709 --> 20:17.083
Yeah!
- Violence rocks!

20:17.166 --> 20:18.208
Yeah!

20:18.291 --> 20:19.667
No, no, no, violence is bad.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.875
It only leads to more violence.

20:21.959 --> 20:22.792
Yeah!

20:22.875 --> 20:25.000
Good. We love violence!

20:27.041 --> 20:29.208
No, no. Peace is the answer.

20:29.583 --> 20:33.375
Oh! That's it! I saw who threw that.
I'm going all Rudy on you!

20:36.959 --> 20:39.875
Oh, this Internet dating
has been so good to us, huh?

20:40.583 --> 20:43.667
Today's the day that
we have been together for three months.

20:44.542 --> 20:47.959
And I was thinking it's time for the kiss.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.250
Oh, Phil.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.959
I didn't see this coming.

20:58.041 --> 21:01.542
All right, just close your eyes
while I get ready.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.667
Okay.

21:08.709 --> 21:09.667
All right.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.500
- I'm ready.
Okay.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.875

21:21.875 --> 21:23.417
Gah!

21:24.250 --> 21:26.750
Oh, I thought we were having moment
of good times.
