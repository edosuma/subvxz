00:07.485 --> 00:09.748
People think it's
very glamorous to be a chef,

00:09.792 --> 00:12.403
but it's not all pretty
all the time.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.189
I think for
a long time we, kind of,

00:15.232 --> 00:16.668
undervalued our cooks.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.670
We still have
a lot of work to do

00:18.714 --> 00:21.412
but I think we'll get there.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.327
I'd like to
see the tides changing

00:23.371 --> 00:25.286
and I think that
they are in large part

00:25.329 --> 00:26.852
because of the younger
generation of chefs

00:26.896 --> 00:29.725
just putting their foot down.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.815
I'm bringing my grit
and I'm bringing my drive.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.513
I feel like I'm unstoppable.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.820
I'm about to take over.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.782
<i>Top Chef</i> is back.

00:43.826 --> 00:47.351
15 of the country's
most talented chefs

00:47.395 --> 00:49.266
have traveled to
Houston to compete

00:49.310 --> 00:51.181
in one of the most
diverse cities in the nation.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.704
Hot stuff!

00:52.748 --> 00:55.577
It's a hot kitchen in here!

00:55.620 --> 00:58.406
I worked in
Paris at the Ledoyen,

00:58.449 --> 01:00.103
which is a three
Michelin star restaurant.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.626
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.541
I was working at
a five star restaurant at 14.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.370
I ended up becoming
head chef at 19-years-old.

01:06.414 --> 01:09.199
I worked with Pierre
and chef Daniel Bouloud.

01:09.243 --> 01:12.202
They helped me
get my green card.

01:12.246 --> 01:15.162
These chefs
are the cream of the crop.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.729
May the best team win.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.209
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.819
Each week, we'll be joined by

01:20.863 --> 01:22.734
a <i>Top Chef</i> all
star guest judge...

01:22.778 --> 01:24.606
Any time that
you tilt your bowl,

01:24.649 --> 01:26.695
you got a good dish.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.914
Along with a local
or national culinary icon.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.134
The brisket was
the star of the plate.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.267
- I was like, "Whoa."
- We love <i>queso.</i>

01:33.310 --> 01:36.139
- I'm gonna aerate it.
- Aren't you fancy?

01:36.183 --> 01:38.141
One minute!
- That clock is not your friend.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.273
Oh, my God!

01:41.753 --> 01:43.407
Welcome to Houston!

01:48.282 --> 01:49.805
At stake for the winner,

01:49.848 --> 01:51.633
a feature in <i>Food</i> <i>
and Wine</i> magazine,

01:51.676 --> 01:54.592
an appearance at the Food
and Wine Classic in Aspen.

01:54.636 --> 01:58.770
$250,000
furnished by San Pellegrino

01:58.814 --> 02:02.165
and the coveted
title of Top Chef.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.791
Hello, chefs!

02:19.835 --> 02:21.228
Oh, my God...

02:21.271 --> 02:23.186
This is crazy!

02:23.230 --> 02:26.755
Welcome to Houston
and to season 19 of Top Chef.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.326
Walking into the Top Chef
kitchen, I'm in a dream.

02:32.369 --> 02:36.852
I am having
an outer body experience.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.596
We've been everywhere,
from New York

02:41.639 --> 02:43.772
to Chicago, to L.A.,
to Portland...

02:43.815 --> 02:45.774
but we've never been to Houston

02:45.817 --> 02:48.994
and it's the fourth
largest city in the country.

02:49.038 --> 02:52.476
And Houston is also
home to Top Chef finalist

02:52.520 --> 02:55.349
and your guest judge,
Dawn Burrell.

02:55.392 --> 02:58.395
I am so excited for
you guys to be in my city.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.484
Houston is a true melting pot.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.530
Every culture
is represented here.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.358
The food is really delicious

03:04.401 --> 03:07.448
and it is the reason
why I love living here.

03:07.491 --> 03:11.234
Take a look around.
Standing amongst you

03:11.278 --> 03:14.542
is an incredible
collection of talented chefs

03:14.585 --> 03:17.675
all here to
compete for the grand prize

03:17.719 --> 03:22.898
of $250,000
furnished by San Pellegrino.

03:22.941 --> 03:26.945
And that title of Top Chef.

03:30.601 --> 03:34.475
I hear Padma but what
I see is that knife block.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.869
My mind immediately goes to

03:37.913 --> 03:40.307
this is looking
like a team challenge.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.527
Being from Houston is
definitely an advantage

03:43.571 --> 03:45.703
in the competition
but team challenges,

03:45.747 --> 03:47.879
those are
the hardest ones on <i>Top Chef.</i>

03:47.923 --> 03:53.624
The 15 of you represent
an incredible range of cuisines,

03:53.668 --> 03:57.715
from Asian to
French to Afro-lachian.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.675
That would be me.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.764
A lot of Southern
Appalachian cuisine

04:02.807 --> 04:04.809
has to do with
cooking out of sustenance.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.811
True living off the land.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.900
I think we have
some James Beard nominees

04:08.944 --> 04:10.337
in the kitchen, right?

04:10.380 --> 04:12.600
- Ashleigh, Sarah.
- Wow.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.558
Raise your hand
if you've ever worked

04:14.602 --> 04:16.560
in a Michelin starred kitchen.

04:16.604 --> 04:20.521
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.827
Wow. It's a big group.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.742
I've worked in
some really good restaurants

04:24.786 --> 04:27.049
but I haven't worked in
three Michelin star kitchens.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.312
I came on this competition

04:29.356 --> 04:31.749
to show that
my collard greens deserve to be

04:31.793 --> 04:34.404
in the same room
as someone else's cassoulet.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.450
There's somebody
here who's worked

04:36.493 --> 04:38.974
in the number one restaurant
in the world. Who is that?

04:39.017 --> 04:41.846
Yes, I worked at
restaurant Noma, Copenhagen

04:41.890 --> 04:44.109
for eight and a half years.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.068
Looks like we have some
competition in the kitchen.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.852
I hope you're ready

04:47.896 --> 04:50.942
because this first
challenge is a silent killer.

04:55.686 --> 04:58.559
Chefs, it's time to draw knives.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.350
This is a team challenge.

05:07.394 --> 05:12.442
Each team must have
a chef holding the number one,

05:12.486 --> 05:14.879
a number two and a number three.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.794
Now, find your teammates.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.448
You got a one?
Two anybody?

05:18.492 --> 05:20.494
I've got a two.
Two? Three?

05:20.537 --> 05:21.930
Two?
I got a three.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.018
I'm Sarah.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.498
- Jackson.
- Robert.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.369
Sarah, Jackson.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.762
I just was not
expecting a team challenge

05:27.805 --> 05:29.938
so quickly, which sucks.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.853
I had COVID a month ago.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.463
Everything was fine,

05:33.507 --> 05:35.509
but I lost
my sense of smell and taste.

05:35.552 --> 05:38.381
But for now, I don't
see a need to tell anyone.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.514
God, does that make me a dick?

05:41.819 --> 05:44.518
So, today's challenge
is just like a trust fall.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.389
Great.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.826
You'll have 30 minutes on
the clock to incorporate

05:48.870 --> 05:52.395
all of your cooking styles
into one cohesive dish.

05:52.439 --> 05:56.138
Each team member
will only have 10 minutes

05:56.181 --> 06:00.447
to contribute to the dish
before the next team member

06:00.490 --> 06:02.405
takes their place.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.541
And, here's where
the trust really comes in, guys.

06:07.584 --> 06:11.936
You will not be allowed
to speak to your teammates.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.852
Am I hearing this right?

06:14.896 --> 06:17.551
- I don't know these people.
- Wow.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.683
Make sure that each
of you add something to the dish

06:19.727 --> 06:21.729
that speaks to
who you are as a chef.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.905
And you're
definitely gonna want to win

06:23.948 --> 06:25.863
this first quickfire
because every chef

06:25.907 --> 06:28.518
on the winning
team gets immunity

06:28.562 --> 06:30.651
in the first
elimination challenge.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.828
When time starts,

06:33.871 --> 06:36.178
everyone with a one can
start cooking immediately.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.485
Everyone with
a two, over here.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.226
Everyone with a three,
you'll be over here.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.707
You'll have
30 minutes on the clock.

06:45.579 --> 06:49.060
Your time starts now!
Good luck!

06:52.107 --> 06:54.762
Go, go, go, go.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.459
Push him off, push him off.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.200
Please, get something!

06:58.243 --> 07:00.507
I'm a little bit scared

07:00.550 --> 07:03.945
because my style of cooking
is Korean and New Orleans.

07:03.988 --> 07:07.470
It has its own
character and it's very unique.

07:07.514 --> 07:12.083
But I have to rely
on other two partners.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.955
I don't want them to mess up.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.565
She got it, she got it.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.089
Sugar, sugar, sugar.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.961
You guys have any
idea what's going on?

07:20.004 --> 07:22.703
I don't think--

07:22.746 --> 07:25.793
My intention is to
build this blank canvas

07:25.836 --> 07:29.492
so that my team
can build on that.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.233
What do you have
going on over there?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.104
How are you
spending these 10 minutes?

07:33.148 --> 07:35.716
Ha! I'm supposed to
know what I'm doing right now?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.674
I have proteins on.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.676
I cook very much on the fly

07:39.720 --> 07:41.939
and I'm also
a very collaborative chef.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.072
So I approached
the entire challenge like a big,

07:44.115 --> 07:45.900
"Choose Your Own Adventure"

07:45.943 --> 07:49.207
and I am the game master.
Did anybody find garlic?

07:49.251 --> 07:51.209
It's to the right
of the watermelon, I think?

07:51.253 --> 07:52.863
Cool!

07:52.907 --> 07:54.952
I choose two proteins:
scallops and pork.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.738
And I decide to
do a romesco sauce

07:57.781 --> 08:01.089
because it can be changed
into many different things.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.526
How do you feel about sharing
your black pepper with me?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.789
Uh, sure. I'll leave it
on my station, you can use it.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.530
I'm upset that I have number one

08:07.574 --> 08:09.053
because I have
nothing to do with

08:09.097 --> 08:10.881
what the final dish
really comes out to be.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.709
I'm trying to
get my guys set up,

08:12.753 --> 08:14.798
things that make sense.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.235
I'm really thinking that we can
sear a steak, make creamed corn.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.976
Really hoping that
the creamed corn makes it

08:19.020 --> 08:21.283
because that's
something I grew up eating.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.809
I want my team
to run to the pantry

08:25.853 --> 08:27.245
as little as possible,

08:27.289 --> 08:29.813
so I spend time
gathering everything

08:29.857 --> 08:31.728
that I think we will need.

08:31.772 --> 08:35.645
I think Leia is just
trying to get everyone set up.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.866
I know that Vietnamese
food has a big imprint

08:38.909 --> 08:40.607
here in Houston,
so I'm trying to give them

08:40.650 --> 08:41.869
a really specific direction.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.087
What is your dish?

08:43.131 --> 08:44.915
Uh, I don't know right now.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.961
I think I'm just trying
to make a base vinaigrette

08:47.004 --> 08:48.745
for these guys.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.226
I grabbed T-Bone
and flank steak, so I'm like,

08:51.269 --> 08:52.575
"I'm gonna make salsa verde".

08:52.619 --> 08:54.577
I made it for so many years

08:54.621 --> 08:56.274
when I worked
for Jonathan Waxman.

08:56.318 --> 08:59.321
That's the old tried and true.
It's always good.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.019
Three minutes left!

09:02.063 --> 09:05.849
So she's making,
like, a salsa verde, I think.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.590
You know what you've got?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.636
You have any idea
of what their doin'?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.202
Not much has happened yet.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.074
- Nope.
- I'm a little confused.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.294
Come on, already.

09:16.338 --> 09:20.255
Time to switch.
Twos go in, ones come out!

09:21.778 --> 09:23.867
Good luck!

09:23.911 --> 09:27.044
Woo!

09:27.088 --> 09:28.568
Now they're hustlin'.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.137
That was an
intense 15 minutes of my life.

09:33.181 --> 09:36.010
I don't understand the corn.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.665
Definitely don't know
what Damarr was going for

09:38.708 --> 09:40.710
but I do see that corn,

09:40.754 --> 09:43.234
so I put it to the stove
top with a bit of butter.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.714
I see the steak.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.281
Hope he already
salted it. Herbs.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.152
I think that our
dish is missing something

09:48.196 --> 09:51.329
that's gonna add some
sort of bitterness to it.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.375
Evelyn, what kind
of food do you make?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.333
I specialize in
a little bit of Southeast Asian

09:55.377 --> 09:56.944
but I am
Mexican and Salvadorian,

09:56.987 --> 09:58.728
so there's
a little influence of that--

09:58.772 --> 10:00.251
Oh, me too!
- You're Mexican-Salvadorian?

10:00.295 --> 10:02.123
Yeah.
Oh, wow!

10:02.166 --> 10:03.994
Do you know what
your team mate had in mind?

10:04.038 --> 10:05.779
Like, a romesco...

10:05.822 --> 10:07.650
The last time that I worked
in a restaurant kitchen,

10:07.694 --> 10:11.175
I think it was October 2019.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.047
I'm very afraid
that I might be rusty

10:13.090 --> 10:14.265
but I've always
been really fast.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.441
Guys, six minutes left!

10:16.485 --> 10:18.748
What do you have?

10:18.792 --> 10:22.273
A T-Bone steak. I have,
like, a salsa verde, I think.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.275
What I think
Jo's trying to tell me

10:24.319 --> 10:26.887
is that she wants
me to cook this steak

10:26.930 --> 10:28.758
along with this chimichurri.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.281
What does she have over there?

10:30.325 --> 10:31.848
Uh, there were some pork chop

10:31.892 --> 10:34.198
and uh, some sort
of, like, a marinade.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.157
She's got it.
She knows what's up.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.772
Sam looks pretty calm.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.034
He's got a lot of stuff forming.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.949
Still going to get more.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.125
As the third chef,
it's giving me a little anxiety

10:48.169 --> 10:50.954
seeing my teammate
stroll through the kitchen

10:50.998 --> 10:52.956
versus run like
all the other chefs.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.219
You can taste crazy in food.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.440
Three minutes, you guys!

10:58.483 --> 11:02.009
Ten minutes goes by so
quickly, there's just panic.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.924
We need to put food on a plate.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.800
Oh, no.

11:17.807 --> 11:21.768
My succotash
fell onto the floor.

11:21.811 --> 11:25.467
I want to make sure, at least,
we have a protein on the plate.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.644
I grab the pork and I put
it right underneath the grill

11:28.688 --> 11:30.646
so they kind of stay warm.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.518
Time to switch!

11:33.562 --> 11:35.564
Let's do it.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.609
Threes go in,
Twos come out, please.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.220
Plates, yeah!
Get them plates!

11:41.657 --> 11:44.225
All right,
well, what do we got here?

11:44.268 --> 11:47.619
Didn't you have
something on the grill?

11:47.663 --> 11:49.273
Is this yours?

11:49.317 --> 11:51.188
Yeah, thank you.
Sorry, I don't--

11:51.232 --> 11:53.800
He's on the wrong station.
The pork is over there.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.279
Anyone's steak, guys?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.455
Yeah, that's mine.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.284
I just want to yell. I'm just,
like, intently staring at him,

12:00.328 --> 12:03.374
trying to see if he
can gaze into my eyes.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.508
<i>The pork is</i> <i>
underneath the grill.</i>

12:06.551 --> 12:09.816
I'm so scared for my life.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.775
All right.
I'll make ----ing eggplant then.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.908
You know, sorry,
I couldn't find it.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.823
I love wood roasted vegetables.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.739
I plan on making
roasted eggplants.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.350
I'm just trying to get cooked
off as quickly as possible.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.873
We're making
a veg dish today

12:23.917 --> 12:25.962
and just,
you and I don't know it yet.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.269
Luke,
what're you makin'?

12:28.312 --> 12:30.227
I think
I'm making some stir fry.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.534
As the third chef coming in,
you don't want to add too much

12:32.577 --> 12:34.405
because that could
change the whole direction

12:34.449 --> 12:36.581
of the dish. But you
don't want to add too little

12:36.625 --> 12:39.367
because all you
did was just plate it.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.412
Being able to translate food

12:41.456 --> 12:43.414
that I've learned in
the last eight years at Noma

12:43.458 --> 12:45.373
is quite difficult
to try to translate that

12:45.416 --> 12:47.854
in only ten minutes
that's on the clock.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.334
Protein's still behind.
I gotta get that cooked.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.294
What have you got cooking?

12:53.337 --> 12:55.731
I got some pork
chops right now.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.472
Marinated and I think
some Asian flavors.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.865
Oh yeah,
I'm working with a T-Bone,

12:58.908 --> 13:00.736
get some Thai flavors going.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.390
Nice.
Gotta rest soon.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.261
I worked in France
and I was 17-years-old

13:04.305 --> 13:05.959
and I couldn't
speak any French at all.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.699
What type of flavors
do you normally work with?

13:07.743 --> 13:09.440
Usually French, but I use a lot

13:09.484 --> 13:10.964
of different cultures into it.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.401
Sometimes the best
form of communication

13:13.444 --> 13:15.490
is not communicating.
If you see something diced,

13:15.533 --> 13:18.885
you understand that this
needs to be diced like this.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.409
I don't know
what this is going to look like.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.628
Like, what is it
going to end up being?

13:23.672 --> 13:26.327
I see creamed corn
that's on the stove.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.633
What I'm thinking is,
this is like, a Southern thing.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.897
You know, I'm from
Mississippi, so I got that.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.855
My team did very well.

13:32.899 --> 13:36.032
So now, I need another component
that's about me on the plate.

13:36.076 --> 13:39.819
I see shallots and I
see Brussel sprouts.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.996
Mississippi is bold.
Mississippi is flavorful.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.127
Now, I gotta deliver.

13:46.390 --> 13:49.393
Three and a half,
guys, three and a half!

13:51.439 --> 13:53.006
Woo!

13:53.049 --> 13:56.096
- I mean, he cooked something.
- Oh, plate, plate!

13:56.139 --> 13:58.359
Ten minutes. I'm plating,
there's not a lot of time.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.796
One minute! Plate!

14:03.973 --> 14:06.933
Yeah, warm plates.
He's a chef, he knows it.

14:06.976 --> 14:12.460
Oh, my God,
Oh, God. Oh, God.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.381
Ten seconds.

14:22.035 --> 14:28.780
Five, four,
three, two, one. Time's up!

14:28.824 --> 14:31.696
Jesus. me.

14:33.133 --> 14:36.658
First challenge, and I ----ed
it all up.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.444
Brown team, please come up.

14:43.795 --> 14:47.495
Thank you. Tell me
about this dish, Jackson.

14:47.538 --> 14:50.367
I made coal roasted
eggplants with, I believe,

14:50.411 --> 14:53.980
macadamia romesco
and a serrano <i>creme fraiche.</i>

14:54.023 --> 14:56.504
Let's start with you, Sarah.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.159
I created a macadamia nut sauce

14:59.202 --> 15:03.946
and some peppers and corn
in the oven to serve as,

15:03.990 --> 15:06.862
like, a succotash for the
pork and scallops that I pulled.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.559
There are no scallops here.

15:08.603 --> 15:09.909
Oh, I know. Yeah.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.998
- Or pork.
- I know.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.000
And then, Robert?

15:14.043 --> 15:16.132
I noticed she had corn,
so I started a succotash.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.527
I also saw that she had some
pork, so I grilled the pork.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.616
I was unable to get
anything on the plate I made

15:21.659 --> 15:23.009
We're so sorry.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.967
- It's okay.
- You didn't see the pork?

15:25.011 --> 15:26.708
I saw you grilling something.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.666
So, I looked for that.
Couldn't find it.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.668
So, I threw some
eggplant in the oven.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.410
Okay, thank you.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.978
It was under the grill

15:36.022 --> 15:38.154
but he was
cooking at your station.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.982
I didn't even see it.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.723
Red team. Come up.

15:41.766 --> 15:42.811
Thank you.

15:43.855 --> 15:47.511
What we have for you
is a thinly cut pork chop,

15:47.555 --> 15:49.122
marinated in
a little bit of Asian spices.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.776
On the bottom is
a grilled corn salad.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.735
And then the sauce, I believe,

15:53.778 --> 15:56.564
is pureed tomato
and a little bit of fish sauce.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.131
Who made the sauce?

15:58.174 --> 15:59.959
- I started it.
- And I finished it.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.831
Who cooked the pork?
- I did.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.225
Did you use oil
while you were cooking the pork?

16:05.268 --> 16:07.531
I believe there
was a little bit of oil

16:07.575 --> 16:08.880
tossed in with the marinade.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.447
Was there oil in the marinade?

16:10.491 --> 16:11.840
I didn't put any
oil in the marinade.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.973
Thank you, all.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.979
Green team, come on up.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.242
Hello, judges.
- Hi, Nick.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.113
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.028
So, we have
a seared New York strip

16:26.072 --> 16:29.075
with some creamed corn
and charred Brussel sprouts.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.902
Thank you.
Thank you, chefs.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.122
Yellow team,
please come up.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.780
It's okay.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.782
Buddha, tell us about this dish.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.784
So we've done a barbecued beef.

16:42.827 --> 16:46.614
It's served with a Thai inspired
som tam salsa verde salad.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.181
We've incorporated
the butter sauce,

16:48.224 --> 16:50.009
which is
a classical French technique

16:50.052 --> 16:52.141
using the umami
of the fish sauce.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.230
There's a lot
of brightness in this dish.

16:54.274 --> 16:57.581
I'm a Texas chef, so
it's a great time for produce.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.713
Okay, thank you, all.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.932
Thank you.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.631
Blue team, please come up.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.024
Sorry, guys.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.026
Oh.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.029
- Oh, no. What happened?
- I lost track of time.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.508
I was just
about to start plating.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.075
It was way too late.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.773
Okay, so I had
the idea to do something simple.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.994
I did a fried
cabbage with vinaigrette.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.257
I'm like, "All right, I can
make a stir fry right now".

17:21.301 --> 17:22.998
You know? "This will be over!"

17:23.042 --> 17:25.740
Okay,
so then, you, Luke, clock in.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.220
- Yup.
- What happened?

17:27.263 --> 17:28.917
I focused, maybe,

17:28.960 --> 17:31.006
too much on trying
to put my own spin on it.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.703
Okay, thank you all.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.183
Thank you.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.754
This was
a very difficult challenge

17:39.797 --> 17:41.756
and I think that
you guys should be happy

17:41.799 --> 17:43.627
that you've made it through.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.194
Which team fell a little short

17:45.238 --> 17:47.718
of blending all three
styles into their dish?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.894
The blue team.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.071
Chefs, I understand
what it feels like

17:52.114 --> 17:54.203
to lose track
of time in the kitchen,

17:54.247 --> 17:56.640
but please let that be
a period, new paragraph moment

17:56.684 --> 17:59.121
and pick yourselves
up for the next challenge.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.167
The red team.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.996
Unfortunately,
the pork was really dry,

18:05.040 --> 18:07.695
lacked a lot
of seasoning and flavor.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.219
That pork was so overcooked.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.570
All right,
now for some good news.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.704
The yellow team.

18:16.747 --> 18:19.141
We really
enjoyed the salsa verde.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
And I thought
the steak was beautiful.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.319
It had a lot
of flavor and brightness.

18:24.277 --> 18:28.716
Brown team.
The romesco was really beautiful

18:28.759 --> 18:30.718
and the eggplant was delicious.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.634
I didn't mind that it
was just a vegetarian dish.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.810
It felt really
robust and complete.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.594
Thank you.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.770
So out of these teams,

18:39.814 --> 18:43.034
which team will receive immunity
in the elimination challenge?

18:52.696 --> 18:55.090
and we were able to
see each chef's style.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.270
The yellow team.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.233
Yeah! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it.

19:07.276 --> 19:08.843
I'm thrilled we won!

19:08.886 --> 19:10.540
It's like a punctuation
mark to everybody else

19:10.584 --> 19:12.412
as to where we're at.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.718
We never met
each other and we won.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.329
Congratulations, yellow team.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.505
All three
of you now have immunity

19:18.548 --> 19:20.463
in the first
elimination challenge.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.858
I think that the other
chefs can now look at us

19:23.901 --> 19:26.687
and say, "Okay, we're
the people to look out for."

19:28.732 --> 19:31.387
Who's ready to get to
the meat of the challenge?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.440
Hi, guys. Hello.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.834
Chefs, please
welcome all-star guest judge

19:43.878 --> 19:47.534
and Seattle <i>Top Chef</i>
winner, Kristen Kish.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.536
And our head
judge, Tom Colicchio.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.320
- Hey, chefs!
- Hi!

19:51.364 --> 19:53.409
- Hey, chef.
- Welcome to Houston, chefs.

19:53.453 --> 19:57.239
I have watched these people
on <i>Top Chef</i> for many years.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.242
It's a moment.
But you know, when you feel

20:00.286 --> 20:02.766
like you're about
to get punched and you,

20:02.810 --> 20:04.855
like, brace yourself?

20:04.899 --> 20:07.597
- Yeah.
- Chefs, this is season 19.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.383
I know you put a lot
of hard work in to get here,

20:10.426 --> 20:12.776
but this will test your limits.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.952
When you get through this,
you'll be a better chef for it.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.390
Good luck.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.782
For this elimination challenge,

20:18.826 --> 20:20.784
you'll be
working in the same teams

20:20.828 --> 20:24.266
you had as the Quickfire.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.616
We're going to
be teammates again.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.227
And the first thing

20:28.270 --> 20:30.185
that comes to
my mind is the comeback.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.276
As a team, you have to
create three cohesive dishes,

20:34.320 --> 20:36.626
all highlighting... beef.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.325
Each of you will be responsible
for one of those dishes.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.501
After you
select your primal cut,

20:41.544 --> 20:43.198
you'll have to break it down.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.722
That's scary.
Butchery is an art.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.943
People study butchery
the way they study pastry.

20:48.986 --> 20:53.295
You'll have $600 to
shop from Whole Foods Market.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.950
Tomorrow,
you'll have two and a half hours

20:55.993 --> 20:59.954
to prep and cook at the Annie
Café before service begins.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.869
Each team can only use

21:01.912 --> 21:04.480
one of these
primal cuts of beef.

21:04.524 --> 21:07.396
Yellow team,
you won the quickfire,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.572
so you get first pick.

21:09.616 --> 21:12.923
You'll also get to pick
which team chooses after you.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.667
And then so on. Get it? Good.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.234
Okay, yellow team.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.981
I say ribs.
We're going to pick the ribs.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.375
Okay. And, who would
you like to go next after you?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
To make this cohesive,
can I be first?

21:32.378 --> 21:34.336
The blue team.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.556
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- That's nice.

21:39.646 --> 21:43.040
The last restaurant
I worked at was Momofuku Wayo

21:43.084 --> 21:44.912
and we specialized in beef.

21:44.955 --> 21:48.307
I would like to think
that I am the king of the beef.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.917
The blue team
will choose the loin.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.789
Okay, who would you
like to go next, blue team?

21:52.833 --> 21:54.400
Brown team.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.972
There's a lot of steaks
in the chuck that we could do.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.757
We're going to
go with the chuck.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.454
Who would
you like to follow you?

22:05.498 --> 22:07.326
The green. Okay.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.676
Thank you.
What's left on the board

22:09.719 --> 22:11.765
is the sirloin cut or the round.

22:14.071 --> 22:17.814
The round, the back of the leg,
so they're tougher cuts of meat.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.599
Green team will do the sirloin.

22:19.642 --> 22:22.602
Okay. Red team,
that leaves you with the round.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.648
- Awesome. I love the round.
- Good.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.084
I remember our first
challenge on my season

22:27.128 --> 22:28.738
where we were in teams,
but we all

22:28.782 --> 22:30.566
had to collaborate
to make one dish.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.307
So I feel like
this is quite a luxury

22:32.351 --> 22:33.917
to all be able to
create your own dishes,

22:33.961 --> 22:36.398
tying them all
together to tell a full story.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.748
Okay, chefs, good luck.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.055
Thank you.
We'll see you tomorrow.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.752
Thank you.

22:42.796 --> 22:46.321
So I'm trying to
do a take on <i>au poivre.</i>

22:46.365 --> 22:49.585
Like, just a peppercorn sauce,
perfectly cooked steak.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.371
- Super simple.
- What would be a flavor

22:52.414 --> 22:54.024
that we could take
through whole thing?

22:54.068 --> 22:55.852
Peppercorn. We could
do a peppercorn tasting.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.550
I love it.
- That's something that could be,

22:57.593 --> 22:59.465
like, a really nice oil finish.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.380
My last challenge wasn't
the best, but getting

23:01.423 --> 23:03.425
a good piece of meat where
I could have a little

23:03.469 --> 23:04.948
more clarity to think,
a little bit more time,

23:04.992 --> 23:07.342
I know I can
organize myself better.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.735
My dish is going to be a kitfo,

23:08.778 --> 23:10.432
so that's
essentially like a beef tartare.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.129
Lebanese?

23:12.173 --> 23:14.480
It's West African.
That's cool.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.046
What were
you thinking of making?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.352
Italian.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.875
I can cook Italian food.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.443
So we got ribs.
Maybe we do a roll.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.445
I'll do the tartare,
I can make a tartare.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.968
I'm gonna do that.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.883
And then,
I might be crazy but in England,

23:26.927 --> 23:28.972
there's a dessert
called spotted dick.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.974
How do you spell that?

23:31.018 --> 23:32.802
All right, look at this guy

23:32.846 --> 23:34.456
riding on
the wild side with immunity.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.110
Usually, like fruit's in there.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.460
Like, we can use beef fat
and you know, it makes sense--

23:38.504 --> 23:40.157
We're just going to
say it over and over again--

23:40.201 --> 23:41.985
Whenever I've been an
executive chef or a head chef,

23:42.029 --> 23:43.857
I've always always
done the pastry menu.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.815
It's the most
creative part of cooking.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.991
You want to take a risk.
Now's the time.

23:48.035 --> 23:50.516
Everyone knows what
you wanted to cook, or?

23:50.559 --> 23:54.520
I can do, like, a quick marinade
on the top round steak,

23:54.563 --> 23:56.478
slice it really thin
and do spring rolls.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.959
I wanted to do, like,
a rice dish, kind of soup--

23:59.002 --> 24:00.395
Soup with--

24:00.439 --> 24:01.657
Rice.
With rice.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.180
More like an Asian flavor.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.834
All right, let's do it, then. Yeah.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.183
I am concerned

24:06.227 --> 24:08.098
that our cooking
styles are so different.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.753
I would really like to do
a pasta for a second course.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.842
Is it going to be
more like a wonton?

24:12.886 --> 24:14.670
More like a pasta.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.672
It will be filled,
but it will be Asian flavors.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.022
I feel like it feels separated.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.155
I can definitely use some, like,
Napa cabbage or some bok choy,

24:21.198 --> 24:23.505
or something
fresh to put in my pasta.

24:23.549 --> 24:26.116
Growing up in North Dakota
was incredibly rural.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.118
Everyone has a farm.
Everyone has a ranch.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.686
We had steak
multiple times a week

24:30.730 --> 24:32.862
and it's served
with a baked potato.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.690
And so,
I want to represent that.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.692
But I also need
to put a spin on it

24:36.736 --> 24:38.520
with this Asian flair

24:38.564 --> 24:40.435
that the other two team
members are excited about.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.915
All right, guys. Let's go.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.314
Sorry, sorry.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.403
I'll start grabbing herbs.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.973
Is it
possible to try this cheese?

24:57.017 --> 24:58.540
Tuna done.
Carrots. Did you get--

24:58.584 --> 25:00.368
I got my carrots.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.544
My culinary style is
very simple. It's very rustic.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.894
So, I've decided that
I'm going to make gnocchi.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.417
Hey, where's your flour?

25:06.461 --> 25:07.680
When I was working at Octavia,

25:07.723 --> 25:09.333
we got a Michelin star,

25:09.377 --> 25:10.639
but it wasn't my restaurant.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.206
Working for
someone highly acclaimed

25:12.249 --> 25:14.034
puts you in this
place where you know,

25:14.077 --> 25:15.383
you kind of live
behind their shadow.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.037
There are usually, like,

25:17.080 --> 25:18.691
really small
packages of mustard seeds.

25:18.734 --> 25:21.520
I just want people to
know who I am through my food.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.565
19 minutes!

25:23.609 --> 25:26.394
Um, olive
oil, onion, carrot, celery,

25:26.437 --> 25:28.701
bok choy, 00 semolina.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.225
I want to bring out
my love for Italian food

25:31.268 --> 25:35.011
but my team really
want to go an Asian route.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.579
Jae, Jae and Stephanie,
you guys got scallions?

25:37.623 --> 25:41.061
So I'm
making seared top round roast

25:41.104 --> 25:44.630
with sweet potato
purée and braised bok choy.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.240
Need to get a good olive oil.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.981
It's not our money.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.591
We're going
to try to treat it

25:49.635 --> 25:51.114
as courses so I'm going to do,

25:51.158 --> 25:52.986
like, the first,
little small course.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.596
Then, she's gonna
bump it up to salad

25:54.640 --> 25:56.555
and then he's
going to make a braise,

25:56.598 --> 25:58.208
something really
filling at the end.

25:58.252 --> 25:59.688
Anybody
see garlic anywhere?

25:59.732 --> 26:01.298
I'm a little worried
because the only thing

26:01.342 --> 26:03.649
that we have all agreed upon

26:03.692 --> 26:06.521
is three different
preparations of the steak:

26:06.565 --> 26:09.437
Seared, char grill and braised.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.265
So you got your salads

26:11.308 --> 26:14.094
Is it really cohesive?
I don't know.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.052
Anything else?
I'm good.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.098
Excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.448
Make sure you
keep an eye on the time.

26:20.491 --> 26:24.060
I'm not really feeling great.

26:24.713 --> 26:28.195
I think that I have
a very bad bladder infection.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.631
That's enough for 12.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.241
How many of micros?

26:31.285 --> 26:33.679
I'm not gonna let
this get in the way

26:33.722 --> 26:36.464
but I just want to
go, lay down and rest.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.771
All right, guys, we good?

26:38.814 --> 26:40.294
I think so.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.078
Thank you very much.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.518
Here it is, here it is.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.520
It's right here, right?

26:50.652 --> 26:53.133
Ooh, so cute.
I love it.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.135
There's a pool table, guys.

26:55.178 --> 26:59.052
I'm excited because I get
to actually talk to the chefs.

26:59.095 --> 27:03.404
Yes, it is a competition.
But we also do have feelings.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.058
Are you guys talking menu

27:05.101 --> 27:06.625
or are you guys
just chit chattin'?

27:06.668 --> 27:09.192
I'm definitely
excited to showcase you soon.

27:12.326 --> 27:14.154
Can I take some of the fat off

27:14.197 --> 27:16.112
of your short rib or
are you gonna need it?

27:16.156 --> 27:18.201
There's also a lot
at the bottom of the chuck.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.116
We're kind
of the nerds in school,

27:20.160 --> 27:21.683
just sitting in
the corner doing our homework

27:21.727 --> 27:23.642
while everyone's hanging out.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.687
If it's delicious,
they're not going to be,

27:25.731 --> 27:27.167
- like, "It's too simple".
- I don't mind.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.516
So Leia is not here right now.

27:28.559 --> 27:29.604
Yeah, she's feeling--

27:29.648 --> 27:31.127
She's not feeling well

27:31.171 --> 27:33.042
and she's taking a little rest.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.044
I think, physically,
yeah, something's going on, so.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.785
Hopefully she gets
some good rest.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.569
She's back tomorrow.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.190
Morning. How are you?

27:50.233 --> 27:52.105
Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.150
Hi, guys.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.586
Okay.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.331
I still don't feel great

28:01.375 --> 28:03.116
but I know how to
be strong in moments

28:03.159 --> 28:04.726
where I need to be strong.

28:04.770 --> 28:07.468
I just want to cook
and it's going to be great.

28:07.511 --> 28:10.340
This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

28:10.384 --> 28:13.735
And like,
I don't want to this up.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.477
Yeah. We got this.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.833
Hi, guys!
How's it goin'?

28:24.877 --> 28:26.748
The priority
is the steak, guys.

28:26.792 --> 28:27.880
Yeah. Gotta get on.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.229
Oh, my God.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.534
Isn't it really nice to talk

28:30.578 --> 28:32.275
to you guys, now? Finally.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.888
I'm glad
we chose rib, you guys.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.585
I mean, everything's tender.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.413
Buddha, you're
rendering the fat, right?

28:39.456 --> 28:41.328
I'm steaming the fat right now.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.200
This dish is a traditional
great British style dessert.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.681
It's pudding that's
steamed together with beef fat.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.509
If you nail this,

28:48.552 --> 28:50.337
it's gonna be ----ing
killer with the judges.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.860
You're gonna
put yourself on the map.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.778
So as soon as we
have the loin and the strip,

28:56.822 --> 28:58.824
should I give you one
piece of cut so you're,

28:58.867 --> 29:00.695
you can specialize in it?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.828
It depends on how
much you get off of it.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.830
While kitfo isn't mainstream,

29:04.873 --> 29:07.223
it's incredibly
comparable to beef tartare.

29:07.267 --> 29:11.793
Most teams are going to
start with a raw beef course.

29:11.837 --> 29:15.362
So I pull out my shito
because that is special to me

29:15.405 --> 29:16.755
and I think that's
really what's going to

29:16.798 --> 29:18.321
make this dish stand out.

29:18.365 --> 29:19.932
Taste this for me.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.629
It's actually not
as crazy as I thought.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.587
Delicious, though.

29:23.631 --> 29:26.155
Hey, Evelyn,
you live in Texas.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.810
- Do you cook with beef a lot?
- My dad has a ranch,

29:28.854 --> 29:31.770
so I'm definitely used
to breaking down some beef.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.510
Oh, wow.

29:33.554 --> 29:36.165
I just normally have
a lot more time, you know?

29:38.385 --> 29:39.734
Robert, you're gonna want

29:39.778 --> 29:41.736
to braise this
chuck down, right?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.652
Yeah, I'll take it.
I'm gonna put it in water.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.480
To stick with the Italian theme,

29:46.523 --> 29:48.656
I want to do
a play on vitello tonnato,

29:48.699 --> 29:50.963
so I'm making a beef
tartare with a tuna aioli.

29:51.006 --> 29:54.314
I know it sounds gross
but I promise you, it's not.

29:54.357 --> 29:57.752
Potato coming.
But I can't really taste much.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.363
Maybe, like, if you hit
it with a little bit of acid.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.452
Hey, Jae!
Yeah!

30:02.496 --> 30:03.932
Remember that
one time we were on <i>Top Chef?</i>

30:06.369 --> 30:08.328
was watching <i>Top Chef</i>

30:08.371 --> 30:11.635
and saying to myself, one
day I want to be on <i>Top Chef.</i>

30:11.679 --> 30:13.812
My parents are
very, very proud of me.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.596
Robert, are you making gnocchi?

30:15.639 --> 30:17.859
I am. We'll
see what it turns out like.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.340
There's a lot
of elements with my dish.

30:20.383 --> 30:21.907
How's time? How's the gnocchi?

30:21.950 --> 30:23.865
I might
need a little bit of help.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.432
Heard.

30:25.475 --> 30:27.303
I still have to make gnocchi

30:27.347 --> 30:29.479
and my pressure cooker
still hasn't started to steam.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.351
You can get on
my burner. I'll swap.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.222
Right now,
I just have to put my head down

30:33.266 --> 30:35.311
and push to get food on a plate.

30:35.355 --> 30:36.878
Here, I'll feed you like a baby?

30:36.922 --> 30:39.011
Stephanie!
- Yeah!

30:39.054 --> 30:40.882
Maybe you're
going to be in the middle

30:40.926 --> 30:43.276
and as the course goes,
it gets more Asian, Asian.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.801
I just wanted to do a beautiful,
simple meat and potato dish.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.543
But I think
adding bok choy is enough

30:49.586 --> 30:51.414
to tie the dishes together.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.807
Are you searing right now--
Grillin' right now?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.548
Yeah, I'm gonna
go grill the meat

30:54.591 --> 30:56.376
and then I'm gonna
grill the radicchio.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.900
I'm going to do this
grilled top round summer roll

30:58.944 --> 31:00.946
with this yuzu tahini sauce.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.904
I'm going to start to assemble.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.559
I try to cut
the steak as thinly as possible.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.387
It's a little chewy.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.041
I can't turn the top
round into a filet mignon.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.738
It is what it is.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.392
I think it's delicious.
Guys, like this:

31:12.435 --> 31:13.567
Standing up.

31:13.610 --> 31:14.829
It's pretty.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.265
It's a little messy.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.880
Yes.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.795
This is the black
garlic miso water reduction.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.928
That's what's going to
get brushed onto the steak.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.930
That sounds good.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.063
I'll be feeling better
once these mushrooms are back

31:31.106 --> 31:32.803
so they can sit
for a little while.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.936
Tom's always talking
about using the entirety

31:34.980 --> 31:36.938
of the product,

31:36.982 --> 31:39.767
so I am going to cut some
nice steaks, sear them rare.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.725
And then, I'm going
to render all that fat,

31:41.769 --> 31:44.815
make a vinaigrette and coat
my mushrooms in that fat.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.470
I got two eyes, chef.
Thank you.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.736
It's a little dry.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.738
I don't want the judges
looking at me and saying,

31:54.782 --> 31:56.784
"Hey, he's got
this braised piece of meat

31:56.827 --> 31:58.351
"and he couldn't get it right."

31:58.394 --> 31:59.700
I think it
needs to stop cooking.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.571
It needs to stop cooking? Okay.

32:01.615 --> 32:05.967
We have 38 minutes.
So I have my pot roast here.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.708
A little scared

32:07.751 --> 32:09.579
that the pressure
cooker took a little while.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.842
A couple of pieces are
still a little bit tough.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.844
It's a big challenge.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.759
This is the most
important part of the plate.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.414
And I haven't cooked my gnocchi.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.982
Are we gonna be
ready in, like, 30 minutes?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.636
Talk to me.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.995
Beautiful place settings.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.171
This is a very
exciting table of humans.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.087
It's an honor
to sit next to you.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.046
Oh, thank you,
chef for being with us.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.396
We are excited to have you here.

32:43.439 --> 32:46.965
I want to welcome
everyone to <i>Top Chef Houston.</i>

32:47.008 --> 32:49.358
The chefs are very
excited to cook for you all.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.621
Your restaurant is beautiful.

32:51.665 --> 32:55.364
They were asked to
do three cohesive dishes

32:55.408 --> 32:59.020
from a primal cut
and work as a team.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.501
I'm about
to start plating.

33:01.544 --> 33:05.026
I wish my pot roast
was a little bit more tender.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.072
Guys,
let me help you. What can I do?

33:07.115 --> 33:08.247
Finish playing these guys.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.857
Don't slow down.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.207
We got it on the plate!

33:13.382 --> 33:15.341
Well, I'm in
love with the way it looks.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.430
I'm not waiting,
I'm eating this hot.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.475
It's gonna get cold.

33:19.519 --> 33:22.000
Mm. Damn,
I'm really enjoying this.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.479
Hi, Brown team.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.046
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.308
Let's start with you, Jackson.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.136
I did a take on vitello tonnato.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.095
The tonnato has
a lot of punch and acid,

33:30.138 --> 33:32.532
not a traditional tonnato,
which is very heavy.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.969
Robert,
what did you make?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.319
I did a pot roast braised
with a little bit of white wine,

33:37.363 --> 33:40.148
a little bit of potato
gnocchi, some parm cream

33:40.192 --> 33:42.629
and a castelvetrano tapenade.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.196
I love how light the gnocchi is.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.894
Oh, well, thank you. Sarah.

33:46.937 --> 33:50.071
I made tallow seared
beef on an eggplant purée

33:50.115 --> 33:52.247
with agrodolce shallots
and a caperberry relish.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.162
Thank you so much.

33:54.206 --> 33:57.470
Thank you.
I'll see you later.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.907
I'm into this team,
I gotta tell you.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.648
All of their
dishes are delicious

34:01.691 --> 34:04.085
and they go
really well together.

34:04.129 --> 34:07.132
Jackson's tartare,
I actually love the fact

34:07.175 --> 34:09.177
that it's ice cold. Yeah.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.918
I think the tuna
sauce is really good.

34:10.961 --> 34:12.659
It's something different.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.662
The star of this meal is
Robert's braised short rib.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.621
The gnocchi is like
a pillow, as it should be.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.580
He made pasta, he
pressure cooked. He had sauces.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.061
He had a lot of things going on
that could have gone wrong

34:23.104 --> 34:25.019
but he actually
did it really well.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.542
I think the gnocchi
turned out well.

34:26.586 --> 34:27.978
You think so?

34:28.022 --> 34:29.371
I really do.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.460
Sarah's seared flat iron steak

34:31.504 --> 34:34.681
is my most
favorite just because I felt

34:34.724 --> 34:37.553
like every
component was so well-balanced.

34:37.597 --> 34:40.121
It just pops with
acid and texture and crunch.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.210
They don't show anything.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.733
Good start.
- Yeah.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.561
Eight minutes.

34:45.605 --> 34:48.260
Eight minutes.
Oh, Lord. All right.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.392
I do not want to be
on the chopping block.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.568
We're so close.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.483
My head feels
like it's gonna explode.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.659
Ah, man. My mushrooms
are starting to congeal,

34:56.703 --> 34:58.270
a little bit.

34:58.313 --> 35:02.491
Five, four,
three, two, one.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.580
Nice job, chefs.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.234
Hell yeah.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.584
Oh, wow.
Thank you.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.456
Thank you. How are you today?

35:10.499 --> 35:12.022
Good, how are you?

35:12.066 --> 35:13.285
I'm good. Very good.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.025
Damarr, what did you make today?

35:15.069 --> 35:16.766
The roasted rare sirloin.

35:16.810 --> 35:20.161
Just mushrooms marinated
in a beef fat vinaigrette.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.597
There's a mixed herb oil

35:21.641 --> 35:23.773
and some little,
petite, sunchoke chips.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.297
Evelyn, tell us about your dish.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.255
I did for you guys,

35:27.299 --> 35:29.301
a spiced
and grilled tri-tip steak

35:29.344 --> 35:33.174
with a charred
eggplant salad and chili jam.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.176
And Nick,
tell us what your dish.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.135
This dish is
dedicated after my grandmother.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.267
This sirloin is stewed

35:39.311 --> 35:42.314
with a lot of fennel,
apples, oranges.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.446
I also made
a sweet potato dumpling.

35:44.490 --> 35:47.014
How do you feel
this is cohesive?

35:47.057 --> 35:48.494
So mine, should have
gone a little bit lighter,

35:48.537 --> 35:50.713
brighter in acid.
And then, you start getting

35:50.757 --> 35:53.194
into her grilled meat
and he has stewed meat,

35:53.238 --> 35:55.327
so, it should go
light to heavy, kind of.

35:55.370 --> 35:58.112
Okay, thank you so much.
We'll see you in a bit.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.375
- Thanks you guys.
- Thank you.

36:00.419 --> 36:03.161
Holy cow.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.207
Damarr's dish is very
simple, very straightforward.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.731
His protein is very tender.
Is it risky at all?

36:08.775 --> 36:10.777
No, it isn't.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.562
Damarr's mushrooms
really threw me off.

36:13.606 --> 36:17.697
They were cold
and slick with congealed fat.

36:17.740 --> 36:21.701
I loved the eggplant in
Evelyn's dish. So flavorful.

36:21.744 --> 36:25.052
Delicious but
the cookery of the beef,

36:25.095 --> 36:28.186
go a little bit more medium rare
would make these better.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.448
I'm proud about what I put out.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.493
Yeah.

36:31.537 --> 36:36.324
Nick's dish, it's very
homey and familiar but it's dry.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.457
Great dish with the wrong cut

36:38.500 --> 36:41.503
because his grandmother
probably used oxtails, you know?

36:41.547 --> 36:43.723
Use something you can
really cook and shred out.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.594
How can I help you with plating?

36:45.638 --> 36:47.770
I'm gonna have
you start putting mushrooms

36:47.814 --> 36:49.381
on the plate.
Mushrooms on plate.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.817
We have two
minutes and 40 seconds!

36:50.860 --> 36:52.514
I would have
liked to have plated it

36:52.558 --> 36:54.212
a little bit differently.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.692
- The dish is still very tasty.
- We need to get it on.

36:56.736 --> 36:57.737
We have a minute now, minute.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.130
I don't feel we're gonna
be on the bottom.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.480
You gonna finish, Sam?

37:01.523 --> 37:02.655
Yes!

37:05.484 --> 37:07.660
Whoa!

37:08.748 --> 37:11.272
Thank you. Thank you.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.708
Wow, this is really rare.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.275
It is.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.277
Love the chili oil.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.626
Yeah, it's good.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.237
Thanks, chef.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.369
So Ashleigh,
tell us about what you made.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.590
I prepared kitfo,
which is a raw beef dish.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.679
And along with that,
I've got an egg yolk sauce

37:26.722 --> 37:28.550
and some red rice
crumble for texture.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.509
Sam?

37:30.552 --> 37:34.469
I made a roasted striploin
grilled with kompot peppercorns

37:34.513 --> 37:36.906
and it's served
with a bread salad.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.604
Luke, what did you make?

37:38.647 --> 37:40.606
New York steak
that's been cured in seaweed,

37:40.649 --> 37:42.303
charred on the grill

37:42.347 --> 37:43.696
and then
I brushed it with a sauce

37:43.739 --> 37:45.306
of seaweed and mushroom.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.265
Below it is
a puree of black garlic

37:47.308 --> 37:48.918
and shiitake mushrooms.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.311
Thank you, blue team.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.531
Thank you.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.274
Ashley's kitfo, her bringing all

37:56.317 --> 37:59.277
of her African
experience into it,

37:59.320 --> 38:02.192
could go down
in tartare history.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.804
Ashleigh's kitfo
makes me happy as can be.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.632
It has a ton of flavor,

38:06.675 --> 38:10.288
it has great texture
and you know, it's not timid.

38:10.331 --> 38:15.597
My thing about Sam's,
it totally blew out my palate

38:15.641 --> 38:17.425
but I couldn't stop eating it.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.732
It seems to me,
like, Luke got lost

38:19.775 --> 38:23.475
in how to put together
the flavors in his dish.

38:23.518 --> 38:26.434
He used roasted mushrooms,
pickled mushrooms,

38:26.478 --> 38:28.741
he cured stuff in seaweed.
There was no umami.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.308
There was no salinity.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.310
There was no
depth of any flavors.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.312
On the plate!

38:34.355 --> 38:36.792
- Hey, we got it on the plate.
- We got it on the plate, yeah.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.446
Nine, 13.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.970
One minute!

38:41.014 --> 38:43.451
Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.584
Go, go, go.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.629
I'm just really trying
to get through this right now.

38:47.673 --> 38:51.241
Ah, my hands are
so shaking. 10 seconds.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.643
Oh, sh--.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.776
I did not get
the bok choy on the plate.

39:03.819 --> 39:06.344
Beautiful, thank you.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.346
Look at
how pretty that is.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.784
Good evening, everyone.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.264
I had the top round steak.

39:14.308 --> 39:17.964
And I made it into a summer roll
with some local peaches,

39:18.007 --> 39:20.706
tahini and lime sauce
and a little basil oil.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.969
Stephanie,
tell us about your dish.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.840
I have the seared top
round with a little bit

39:24.884 --> 39:27.321
of kimchi paste
and some sweet potato puree

39:27.365 --> 39:29.497
and oxtail demi.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.630
Was there braised
bok choy in your dish.

39:32.413 --> 39:35.024
No, there is not.
That's the one thing I forgot.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.505
Jae, what did you make for us?

39:37.549 --> 39:39.420
I never been to North Korea,

39:39.464 --> 39:44.338
and this is my imaginary
North Korean bibimbap.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.949
I use the eyeround
with vegetables.

39:46.993 --> 39:51.258
Then I seasoned it with
the soy sauce and sesame oil.

39:51.301 --> 39:54.043
And on top,
it has a soy marinade egg yolk.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.263
How did you come
up with your menu?

39:56.306 --> 39:58.526
Did you compare notes?

39:58.570 --> 40:03.401
We, kind of, all were
inspired by these Asian flavors

40:03.444 --> 40:05.054
and so we, kind of,

40:05.098 --> 40:06.795
each did our own
personal take on that.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.580
Thank you very much, ladies.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.976
I think there were
some really interesting ideas

40:14.020 --> 40:16.457
but each
of the dishes didn't, like,

40:16.501 --> 40:18.416
really come together for me.

40:18.459 --> 40:21.723
Uh, Leia's summer roll?
I mean, restrained.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.596
The leek sauce, just,
that didn't do anything.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.815
The tahini was
overpowering for everything.

40:26.859 --> 40:31.603
I'd rather do a little
bit smaller wrap, tighter,

40:31.646 --> 40:35.433
because you want to
have a perfect bite on it.

40:35.476 --> 40:36.651
Is it good?

40:36.695 --> 40:38.566
Jae's dish was interesting.

40:38.610 --> 40:42.614
I liked the egg yolk and I am
not completely familiar,

40:42.657 --> 40:46.052
nor maybe is she with
the dish she was inspired by.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.054
I just wanted
the beef to be there

40:48.097 --> 40:49.969
and I just wasn't getting it.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.798
She could have seared
the meat a little bit, you know,

40:52.841 --> 40:55.322
to give it a better taste
and texture.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.585
Stephanie's
beef and sweet potato?

40:57.629 --> 41:00.588
I don't-- I have no
idea what that has to do

41:00.632 --> 41:02.111
with the rest
of the other two dishes.

41:02.155 --> 41:03.548
She admitted she
forgot the bok choy.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.593
That's a big miss.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.943
I'm like sick to my stomach
that I forgot that bok choy.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.082
Three minutes, 50 seconds.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.431
That's cooled all the way, yeah?

41:17.475 --> 41:18.519
- It's cooled all the way.
- Perfect.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.129
With this dessert,

41:20.173 --> 41:21.870
I'm trying to show
myself on the plate.

41:21.914 --> 41:24.090
This is a style
of food that I like to cook.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.787
If I pull it off,

41:25.831 --> 41:27.833
I think I can
really make an impression.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.443
10 seconds.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.097
Time's up!

41:34.230 --> 41:36.406
Pretty food.
Smells good.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.104
That looks great.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.453
Beef is
what's for dessert?

41:39.497 --> 41:40.846
Yeah.

41:40.889 --> 41:43.109
Yeah.
Hello.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.546
Hello, yellow team.
Monique, what did you make?

41:45.590 --> 41:47.853
I prepared for
you a beef tartare.

41:47.896 --> 41:51.900
It's marinated in a nori
seaweed paste and tamari

41:51.944 --> 41:54.294
and cured some egg yolk
and then, grated that on top.

41:54.337 --> 41:56.426
Jo?

41:56.470 --> 41:58.428
I prepared a ribeye rub
with a bit of black garlic

41:58.472 --> 42:00.518
with a kare-kare
sauce to go underneath.

42:00.561 --> 42:03.172
- And Buddha.
- I prepared dessert today.

42:03.216 --> 42:06.567
We have a beef fat-inspired
cake, miso ice cream,

42:06.611 --> 42:08.569
a beef fat caramel.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.484
Have you made
a dessert with beef before?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.094
This is my first time.

42:12.138 --> 42:15.402
Thank you so much.

42:15.445 --> 42:19.232
Wow. Monique's tartare.
What did you think?

42:19.275 --> 42:20.581
The balance of the textures

42:20.625 --> 42:22.235
and the flavor
and the creativity?

42:22.278 --> 42:23.497
I mean, I think
it's really excellent.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.194
Overall, it's good.

42:25.238 --> 42:27.240
I enjoyed that
tamari onion juice in it.

42:27.283 --> 42:30.025
I was really
intrigued with the egg yolk.

42:30.069 --> 42:32.506
It composed the plate for me.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.160
How do you feel?

42:34.203 --> 42:36.031
I feel good.

42:36.075 --> 42:37.990
I'm feelin' good,
I'm feelin' good...

42:38.033 --> 42:40.514
I really liked the way that
Jo cooked the ribeye itself.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.996
And I like the freshness
of the relish on top.

42:44.039 --> 42:45.606
I love that Buddha
decided to make a dessert.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.348
Has immunity,
so why not go for it?

42:48.391 --> 42:51.438
I loved the texture
of the caramel in the middle.

42:51.481 --> 42:53.309
The crunch was great.

42:53.353 --> 42:55.529
This is the most exciting
one and the most balanced one

42:55.573 --> 42:56.965
as far as
the flavors are concerned.

42:57.009 --> 42:58.271
Everything stood out.

42:59.098 --> 43:00.403
And standing out was
part of the challenge.

43:00.447 --> 43:01.970
Well, he did
that just in the title.

43:02.014 --> 43:04.364
Right.

43:04.407 --> 43:07.933
Congratulations, you made
it through 15 courses of beef.

43:07.976 --> 43:10.065
I think the conversation
at the table

43:10.109 --> 43:12.590
really is a great
sign for the season

43:12.633 --> 43:14.026
we're all about to enjoy.

43:14.069 --> 43:15.549
Thank you.

43:24.514 --> 43:26.386
Is there wine in there?

43:26.429 --> 43:27.517
There is wine. Yeah.

43:27.561 --> 43:29.955
Who needs wine?

43:29.998 --> 43:31.391
Who needs
one of these?

43:31.434 --> 43:33.393
Should we do a big toast?
- Yes!

43:36.701 --> 43:39.660
It's all good to be
with everyone in the kitchen

43:39.704 --> 43:41.662
and be able
to talk, that was like--

43:41.706 --> 43:44.230
Can we talk?

43:44.273 --> 43:45.623
Actually being able
to talk was huge.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.276
Everybody got food on the plate?

43:47.320 --> 43:49.235
Everyone got their food?

43:49.278 --> 43:50.628
I did not. My braised bok choy.

43:51.716 --> 43:54.022
I think I should be
okay but it still sucks.

43:54.066 --> 43:56.459
Like, they see it on the menu.

43:56.503 --> 43:58.548
We're enjoying
each other's company so much

43:58.592 --> 44:00.246
that I forgot
someone's going home tonight.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.595
Don't bring it up.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.293
It's just our reality.

44:04.337 --> 44:07.253
Let's get on up
and let's go face these judges.

44:07.296 --> 44:10.212
Let's do it.
- Yeah.

44:10.256 --> 44:12.084
All right,
come on. Jump on in, Jackson.

44:24.487 --> 44:26.620
Overall, the first
challenge is always tough.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.448
There's a lot of nerves.

44:28.491 --> 44:30.102
Those that worked
with big teams are realizing

44:30.145 --> 44:31.538
that there's no sous chefs here.

44:31.581 --> 44:33.453
This is a tough challenge.

44:33.496 --> 44:35.498
There were some
really outstanding dishes

44:35.542 --> 44:37.587
and of course, there
were a few clunkers as well.

44:37.631 --> 44:40.329
Our favorite team tonight was...

44:43.637 --> 44:45.552
The brown team.

44:46.509 --> 44:47.641
What?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.121
Congratulations.

44:53.342 --> 44:55.997
Please stay here, everyone else,
please step to the side.

44:56.041 --> 44:57.346
Thank you.

45:01.089 --> 45:03.222
You look a little bit surprised.

45:03.265 --> 45:05.180
- I'm shocked.
- I'm very surprised.

45:05.224 --> 45:07.226
Why are you so surprised?

45:07.269 --> 45:10.142
In a really intimidating room
of super impressive people,

45:10.185 --> 45:12.492
it's really hard to
know where you stand.

45:12.535 --> 45:14.668
- The competition is stiff.
- Yeah.

45:14.712 --> 45:18.237
Collectively,
you guys had three solid dishes.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.455
- Good start.
- Thank you.

45:19.499 --> 45:23.285
Yours was clearly one menu.

45:23.329 --> 45:25.157
I mean, that's what
stood out to all of us

45:25.200 --> 45:27.159
as we ate your food
and it makes a difference.

45:27.202 --> 45:28.813
Robert, what
I loved most about your dish

45:28.856 --> 45:31.598
was it was comforting,
but it was truly elevated.

45:31.641 --> 45:33.774
I think the balance
of the parmesan

45:33.818 --> 45:35.689
with the beef and the gnocchi,

45:35.733 --> 45:37.517
everything was pillowy
and light and bright and airy.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.519
Meat was nicely braised

45:39.562 --> 45:41.390
and it's tough to
braise meat in a pressure cooker

45:41.434 --> 45:43.392
in two hours, but you did it.
You pulled it off.

45:43.436 --> 45:45.177
Thank you.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.179
Robert, you were the only
one out of the whole group

45:47.222 --> 45:48.833
who really cooked that meat

45:48.876 --> 45:51.139
and brought out
an inherent beef flavor.

45:51.183 --> 45:52.532
Thank you.

45:52.575 --> 45:54.273
Jackson. Your tartare--

45:54.316 --> 45:55.840
And we ate a lot
of tartares today--

45:55.883 --> 45:59.800
Was exceptional in
the fine dice of the meat

45:59.844 --> 46:02.063
and in the seasoning
of the meat.

46:02.107 --> 46:03.717
Jackson,
I really loved the tartare.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.719
The tonnato just
lifted up and it, sort of,

46:05.763 --> 46:07.155
expressed that
flavor of the beef.

46:07.199 --> 46:08.766
Thank you.

46:08.809 --> 46:10.550
Sarah, what I love
most about your dish

46:10.593 --> 46:12.247
was all the different
plays of texture.

46:12.291 --> 46:13.727
I thought it was
a really wonderful,

46:13.771 --> 46:16.512
playful interpretation
of a carbonara.

46:16.556 --> 46:18.645
So you had the sweet and salty
and the crunchy and nutty.

46:18.688 --> 46:20.473
The meat had tons of flavor

46:20.516 --> 46:22.562
and I thought that you
did the right thing with it.

46:22.605 --> 46:24.129
Really was delicious to eat.

46:24.172 --> 46:25.739
Thank you.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.873
Tonight's winning
chef delivered a beautiful,

46:28.916 --> 46:30.831
technically sound dish.

46:30.875 --> 46:32.833
The beef was treated
really, really wonderfully

46:32.877 --> 46:35.836
and truly it was
delicious and a joy to eat.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.796
And the winning
chef for us tonight is...

46:43.452 --> 46:46.151
Robert.
Congratulations, Robert.

46:47.630 --> 46:49.154
I really can't believe

46:49.197 --> 46:50.677
that I won to be
quite honest with you.

46:53.854 --> 46:57.684
There's so much self-doubt,
you're out of your element.

46:57.727 --> 47:00.252
And, you know, everyone's
so talented. It's surreal.

47:00.295 --> 47:01.775
I'm really happy that I won.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.342
I just want to
make sure that, like,

47:03.385 --> 47:05.126
this isn't as high as I can go.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.519
Your gnocchis were really good.

47:06.562 --> 47:07.650
Awesome. Thank you.

47:07.694 --> 47:08.826
Nice work.

47:08.869 --> 47:10.610
Congratulations, brown team.

47:10.653 --> 47:12.481
You can all step to the side.

47:15.484 --> 47:18.748
Red team, please come forward.

47:21.360 --> 47:25.712
Red team, you unfortunately had
our least favorite meal today.

47:26.931 --> 47:31.239
And sadly, one of you
will be going home tonight.

47:40.683 --> 47:42.903
Let's get into
the nitty gritty of these dishes

47:42.947 --> 47:44.905
and figure out what went wrong.

47:44.949 --> 47:46.646
Stephanie, were you comfortable

47:46.689 --> 47:49.649
with doing
something Asian inspired?

47:49.692 --> 47:51.651
Not really.

47:51.694 --> 47:53.261
Originally,
I was actually going to do like

47:53.305 --> 47:55.437
a filled dumpling
or a filled pasta

47:55.481 --> 47:58.919
but I kind of stuck to
what I know in the Midwest,

47:58.963 --> 48:01.748
is meat and potatoes. You know?

48:01.791 --> 48:04.925
I wanted to balance it
as best I could, as best--

48:04.969 --> 48:07.449
In the ability that
I know Asian cuisine,

48:07.493 --> 48:09.669
which I,
you know, I really don't.

48:09.712 --> 48:12.411
That bok choy that
was left off your plate,

48:12.454 --> 48:14.413
was that tossed in
an Asian vinaigrette

48:14.456 --> 48:16.110
or something like that?

48:16.154 --> 48:18.721
I braised it in
a little bit of the oxtail

48:18.765 --> 48:20.723
and then I hit it
with quite a bit of lime

48:20.767 --> 48:22.856
and some salt to give that dish
a little bit of brightness.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.206
Did you just run out
of time to get it on the plate?

48:25.250 --> 48:27.121
Yeah, it was just time.

48:27.165 --> 48:31.212
Jae, walk us
through why you would choose

48:31.256 --> 48:32.997
for your first
elimination challenge,

48:33.040 --> 48:34.955
to make something
that you admittedly

48:34.999 --> 48:37.915
weren't that familiar with?

48:37.958 --> 48:40.874
There were a couple of reasons.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.876
I wanted to
take on the raw beef.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.138
Uh...

48:45.792 --> 48:47.011
Are you okay?

48:47.054 --> 48:48.795
I'm okay.

48:48.838 --> 48:51.711
I read about
the North Korean cooking

48:51.754 --> 48:53.191
and haven't seen the dish,

48:53.234 --> 48:55.497
but I thought
about it for a long time.

48:55.541 --> 48:58.152
You can read all you want,
but you have to eat the food

48:58.196 --> 48:59.284
to really understand--

48:59.327 --> 49:00.850
I learned it very hard.

49:00.894 --> 49:02.417
Leia, how about you?

49:02.461 --> 49:03.984
Do you make
a lot of summer rolls?

49:04.028 --> 49:05.333
I don't make
a lot of summer rolls.

49:05.377 --> 49:07.770
I have made summer rolls before.

49:07.814 --> 49:09.250
Leia, in your
summer roll, unfortunately,

49:09.294 --> 49:11.165
there was a lot
of sinew in my first bite,

49:11.209 --> 49:12.384
so I had to spit it out.

49:13.907 --> 49:16.344
It was so large and overstuffed.

49:16.388 --> 49:18.999
- Right.
- It just completely fell apart.

49:19.043 --> 49:20.870
I do agree that
it was overfilled,

49:20.914 --> 49:22.307
there was too
much sauce on the plate.

49:22.350 --> 49:23.786
I rushed
and I missed the details.

49:23.830 --> 49:26.789
I recognize that and I own it.

49:26.833 --> 49:29.053
We have a very
difficult decision to make.

49:29.096 --> 49:30.793
We'll call you back in a bit.

49:30.837 --> 49:32.795
Thank you all. Thanks.

49:36.016 --> 49:37.191
Wow.

49:38.149 --> 49:39.759
Congrats, brown team.

49:39.802 --> 49:41.500
Congrats, Robert.

49:41.543 --> 49:45.895
Congrats, brown team.
Woo!

49:45.939 --> 49:49.029
You should be grinning
from ear to ear right now.

49:49.073 --> 49:51.945
I mean, I honestly didn't know
if I was going to make it.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.903
It was like one hour
and I was, just like--

49:53.947 --> 49:55.383
I was like, "Are you good?"

49:55.427 --> 49:57.777
And you were
just like, "I unno..."

49:57.820 --> 50:00.954
Well, it's the first
challenge and it's always tough.

50:00.998 --> 50:02.912
Yeah, I think
the chefs clearly are nervous.

50:02.956 --> 50:04.914
Seems like there's a lot
of little mistakes being made.

50:04.958 --> 50:07.395
Kristen, you certainly know
what they're going through.

50:07.439 --> 50:09.180
During the Quickfire,
I think you asked people, like,

50:09.223 --> 50:10.833
their accolades
and you figured out

50:10.877 --> 50:12.531
who worked in
Michelin star kitchens.

50:12.574 --> 50:14.924
And I think when you're
amongst your peers like that,

50:14.968 --> 50:17.188
and you start to hear that,
all of a sudden you feel like,

50:17.231 --> 50:19.059
"I need to step up,
I need to impress."

50:19.103 --> 50:21.931
And what got you here
is no longer present anymore.

50:21.975 --> 50:25.805
All three of them did
not trust themselves today.

50:25.848 --> 50:27.459
I mean, Stephanie said,

50:27.502 --> 50:29.287
"I was not
comfortable with Asian food."

50:29.330 --> 50:30.940
And Leia's summer roll,

50:30.984 --> 50:32.333
the only thing
that made it Asian

50:32.377 --> 50:34.118
was just throwing
it in a rice paper roll

50:34.161 --> 50:36.033
and calling it a summer roll.

50:36.076 --> 50:40.124
And for Jae, her dish
was inspired by a Korean dish.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.256
But then, it just got
watered down over time.

50:42.300 --> 50:43.997
The three of them forgot

50:44.041 --> 50:46.521
about the main point
of the challenge.

50:46.565 --> 50:50.221
How are you going to
make that beef really shine?

50:50.264 --> 50:52.092
I think Stephanie's dish,

50:52.136 --> 50:53.833
in terms of doing
something with the beef,

50:53.876 --> 50:55.313
it probably was
the beefiest of the three.

50:55.356 --> 50:57.184
It wasn't cohesive,

50:57.228 --> 50:59.839
but as a dish it was
much better than the other two.

50:59.882 --> 51:01.101
It was waiting to take off.

51:01.145 --> 51:02.581
It just never really took off.

51:02.624 --> 51:04.278
Otherwise, it was fine.

51:04.322 --> 51:06.280
My flavors weren't there,
for sure. Fully admit it.

51:06.324 --> 51:08.282
Fully admit it.

51:08.326 --> 51:10.241
Jae's dish, I mean,
this is a beef challenge.

51:10.284 --> 51:12.504
We got a little bit
of raw beef, it had zero flavor.

51:12.547 --> 51:15.420
But also, the rice
was just cooked improperly,

51:15.463 --> 51:17.900
That was rough.

51:17.944 --> 51:20.512
With Leia, beef was the worst
part of the summer roll

51:20.555 --> 51:22.905
and it was a bad summer roll.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.951
It almost seemed like
the beef was an afterthought.

51:24.994 --> 51:27.084
Instead of the starting point,
it was the last thing.

51:27.127 --> 51:29.260
It was the thing
in both their dishes

51:29.303 --> 51:31.131
that were the least tended to.

51:31.175 --> 51:33.960
And it was the thing
that needed most tending.

51:34.003 --> 51:36.484
I ----ed up.
And I can own that.

51:36.528 --> 51:39.139
I think we have our answer.

51:39.183 --> 51:42.099
- Mm-hm.
- Let's get them out here.

51:48.235 --> 51:50.629
You know, chefs,
clearly some mistakes made.

51:50.672 --> 51:52.326
These weren't our best dishes.

51:52.370 --> 51:54.154
The three of you
just seemed really,

51:54.198 --> 51:56.417
really disjointed
and it just didn't work at all.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.205
Padma.

52:07.689 --> 52:11.476
Leia, please pack
your knives and go.

52:11.519 --> 52:13.913
Thank you so much.

52:13.956 --> 52:15.654
Even being in
this kitchen for one day

52:15.697 --> 52:18.222
was just incredible.

52:18.265 --> 52:20.920
It sucks. You know,
you don't put your life on hold

52:20.963 --> 52:25.925
to compete in the most
prestigious cooking competition

52:25.968 --> 52:28.449
to be eliminated
in the first challenge.

52:29.755 --> 52:31.191
Leia, it's not over yet.

52:31.235 --> 52:32.714
There is
the Last Chance Kitchen.

52:32.758 --> 52:34.673
So, you do have
a shot at getting back in.

52:34.716 --> 52:36.544
Thank you so much.

52:36.588 --> 52:40.069
I made some very rookie
mistakes. I was not focused.

52:40.113 --> 52:42.333
I did not pay
attention to detail.

52:42.376 --> 52:44.378
It was not
my best day and it was me.

52:45.727 --> 52:47.164
It's me.

52:48.339 --> 52:50.689
Guys, kick some ----ing ass.

52:50.732 --> 52:52.691
Woo!
Yeah.

52:52.734 --> 52:56.434
I'm a fighter.
Don't count me out just yet.

53:02.266 --> 53:04.398
This season on <i>Top Chef...</i>

53:04.442 --> 53:06.095
Let's go!
Go!

53:06.139 --> 53:07.532
You guys gonna
carve lettuce tonight?

53:07.575 --> 53:09.664
That's the plan.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.623
I'm trying to
bring the mood up high.

53:11.666 --> 53:14.234
I wanna be buried in
whatever this is when I die.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.584
Which I might
because of all the shellfish.

53:16.628 --> 53:18.499
All that blood is from
one of our chefs

53:18.543 --> 53:20.458
- you see on the plate here.
- Oh...

53:20.501 --> 53:22.286
Oh, so we don't
have to send anyone home.

53:22.329 --> 53:24.984
- I won't ask whom.
- Woo!

53:25.027 --> 53:27.160
Have you ever
worked with alligator?

53:27.204 --> 53:29.249
I've worked with an alligator,
but I haven't broken one down.

53:29.293 --> 53:30.772
To the brisket gods.

53:30.816 --> 53:32.383
Welcome to Restaurant Wars.

53:32.426 --> 53:35.212
Celebrate the soul of cooking.

53:35.255 --> 53:37.431
Who wants to eat!

53:37.475 --> 53:39.172
We're pretty excited
about tasting your space food.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.739
Cheers!

53:40.782 --> 53:42.610
It's going to be
a beautiful, interesting season

53:42.654 --> 53:44.612
if we're cooking like this.

53:49.443 --> 53:51.663
There's the velociraptor.

53:51.706 --> 53:53.621
Brace yourselves, guys.

53:53.665 --> 53:55.449
I'm so nervous to be
cooking barbecue in Texas.

53:55.493 --> 53:57.495
Because you
don't mess with Texas.

53:57.538 --> 53:59.497
Yeah, and then
they brought all of us in here

53:59.540 --> 54:00.628
to mess with it.
