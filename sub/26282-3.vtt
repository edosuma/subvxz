WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.587
-Previously on The Resident...
-I also know a desperate man.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.588
You've been a locum tenens

00:20.621 --> 00:22.256
for the last 36 months, hopping

00:22.290 --> 00:23.891
from hospital to hospital.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.994
I'm Julian Booth, device rep
for QuoVadis. I was a dancer

00:27.027 --> 00:29.930
until one day, I was hit
by a car. Total hip replacement

00:29.963 --> 00:32.666
gave me my life back
and made me a true believer.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.668
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.671
-A million five.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.174
You're gonna have
to learn to work together.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.610
-Nic, I'm trying.
-This was never our problem.

00:42.643 --> 00:46.013
-Not here, not now.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.349
I got the cue ball curving
while chilling with Irving.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.284
A few more drinks,
and he might start swerving.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.520
Looking like that,
I'm surprised they let us in.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.190
And my rhymes are so sick, but
I don't need your bad medicine.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.958
-Oh!
-That was... was not great.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.728
Well, I don't have
to be good to love hip-hop,

01:00.761 --> 01:02.596
so put that in your pocket
and lock it.

01:02.630 --> 01:07.135
Noted. So are we getting back
to the game or what?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.237
-Mine.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.606
I got to be honest. I'm pretty
tired of beating you.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.909
Ouch. Words hurt, man.

01:15.943 --> 01:19.280
* You're looking for Joanie *

01:19.313 --> 01:22.550
* Was Joanie there? *

01:22.583 --> 01:24.918
-* But if you find Judy... *
-That's not cool.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.987
No, what's not cool is you guys
hogging the table for two hours.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.756
Yeah, people are waiting.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.424
And if you've been shooting
like that, you're cheating.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.793
The rule is, one foot
on the ground at all times.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.729
-I'm pretty sure I did.
-I'm positive you didn't.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.465
IRVING:
Why don't you show us

01:37.498 --> 01:41.435
how it's done...
whoever you are?

01:41.469 --> 01:43.637
Oh, what a gentleman,
giving me the cue

01:43.671 --> 01:46.140
that's loose in the middle,
chipped on top.

01:46.174 --> 01:50.211
Every bar has a crooked cue,
and I'm looking at it.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.181
You're not slick.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.883
I don't... like you.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.754
You make the shot,
you get the table.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.525
* That you surely
don't want to find *

02:04.558 --> 02:07.861
* You're looking for Joanie *

02:07.895 --> 02:09.763
* Was Joanie there... *

02:09.797 --> 02:11.432
-Oh.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.101
* But if you find Judy... *

02:14.134 --> 02:15.469
Deal's a deal.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.439
* Better leave it alone *

02:18.472 --> 02:20.208
* Leave it alone... *

02:20.241 --> 02:22.443
-Have a good night.
-You too.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.779
* Leave it alone,
you better leave it alone... *

02:25.813 --> 02:28.516
See you at Chastain.
We start as interns on Monday.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.650
* Leave it alone... *

02:29.683 --> 02:31.051
Great, just what we need--

02:31.084 --> 02:33.287
a new batch of arrogant,
know-it-all interns.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.291
* Leave it alone,
leave it alone *

02:37.325 --> 02:39.327
* Y'all better leave it alone *

02:39.360 --> 02:41.061
JESSICA:
Hello?

02:41.094 --> 02:44.232
: Hello?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.733
Nic?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.501
Are you with me?

02:47.535 --> 02:51.339
Irving's three-year
Chastain anniversary bash.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.140
404 Tavern.
You're going, right?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
Excuse me. Coming through!

02:58.679 --> 03:00.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:04.452 --> 03:05.853
Linda?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.521
-I told you, we don't have any.
-Come on.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.423
-I know you have a stash.
-MITCHELL: What about

03:09.457 --> 03:11.759
my patients? They need it
just as much as yours does.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.361
My patient is young,
immunosuppressed,

03:13.394 --> 03:14.895
with a history
of a liver transplant.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.196
She had a syncopal episode.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.998
BP 82/40, heart rate 120.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.368
Two days of vomiting
and diarrhea.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.102
-She's severely dehydrated.
-She just got married.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.338
Help her.

03:24.372 --> 03:28.175
Excuse me. Coming through.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.379
Oh, miracle workers,
both of you.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.449
We'll start getting some fluids
in your wife,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.017
and figure out what's going on.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.020
Thank you, Dr. Feldman.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.623
IRVING:
Glad you were passing through.
Thanks for helping out.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.957
We're a level-1 trauma center

03:43.991 --> 03:45.559
and we can't get
a bag of salt water.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.628
Things like this happen
in third world countries.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.096
They're not supposed
to happen here.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.464
It's gonna continue to happen
until someone in power

03:50.498 --> 03:52.366
decides to fix the problem.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.801
Where you going?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.202
Speak truth to power.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
*

04:06.680 --> 04:09.317
("The Marriage of Figaro:
Duettino

04:13.454 --> 04:16.256
Well, evidently,
my revolving door of assistants

04:16.290 --> 04:17.958
is either charmed by you or

04:17.991 --> 04:20.260
asleep at the desk,
which is more likely!

04:20.294 --> 04:23.297
Either way, I-I don't have time
for whatever this is.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.466
The staff is hoarding
and rationing saline.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.935
Patients' lives are at risk,
and if that doesn't get you

04:27.968 --> 04:30.103
to focus, it's lawsuit
waiting to happen.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.739
Yeah, I'm fully aware.
I have a plan in motion.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.974
See yourself out.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.444
Please tell me your plan
doesn't involve my father.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.913
How is that any concern
of yours?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.416
My father invests in companies,
he makes his money,

04:42.450 --> 04:45.285
and then he moves on,
leaving scorched earth behind.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.822
I can handle your father.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.060
Then I guess we'll see.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.437
I got your page.
Everything okay?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.673
It is. You've been requested.

05:05.706 --> 05:09.209
Mr. Candelora would like you
on his wife's case.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.380
I pulled up reviews on Chastain.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.349
Dr. Hawkins has five stars, but
Dr. Feldman only has four, so...

05:15.383 --> 05:17.651
Dear, don't you think we should
have discussed this first?

05:17.685 --> 05:20.287
What's to discuss, my
love? You deserve the best care.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.156
You're being rude. I need you
to relax, relate, release.

05:23.190 --> 05:26.293
I wish I could,
but my wife passed out

05:26.326 --> 05:27.695
at a coffee shop
she made me stop at

05:27.728 --> 05:30.163
on her way
to the doctor's office.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.399
It's not constructive
to place blame

05:31.432 --> 05:32.666
during intense discussions.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.034
We're having an argument--

05:34.067 --> 05:35.669
just call it an argument.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.705
:
Good luck.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.140
Uh, conflict minimization.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.910
It's a technique Brianna found
to keep the honeymoon alive,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.478
even though
we're still newlyweds.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.414
The honeymoon phase
is a state of mind.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.582
:
Can we please

05:48.616 --> 05:50.350
have Dr. Hawkins treat you?

05:50.384 --> 05:52.386
IRVING:
It's okay. If I ever

05:52.420 --> 05:53.821
get married,
I hope to be just as good

05:53.854 --> 05:55.222
at fighting
for my wife's health.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.425
Well, you've got
some big shoes to fill.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.227
I didn't get my new liver
from just anyone.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.929
John was my donor.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.664
I didn't have a choice.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.566
World's better with you in it.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.735
Back at you.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.337
So will you let them look
at your cough?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.874
I'm fine. Um, could Brianna
be rejecting the liver?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.743
I'll ultrasound her abdomen,
send off some labs,

06:15.776 --> 06:18.512
see what that tells us.
You sure you're okay?

06:18.546 --> 06:21.749
I will be once we figure out
what's wrong with my wife.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.786
I can't believe you.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.388
-Baby, just...
-Sit down. Sit.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.458
: You are stressing.
-I'm not stressing.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.093
-Look at you.
You've got tubes in your nose.
-Just breathe.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.529
:
You're stressing out.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.698
-Yeah.
-I love you.
-BELL: 50%

06:37.731 --> 06:40.468
of all saline is made
in a factory in Puerto Rico,

06:40.501 --> 06:42.369
which isn't operating...
since the hurricane.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.905
Two other companies
have a monopoly on the rest.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.140
They can't handle the shortage,
and on top of that,

06:47.174 --> 06:49.242
they're using the high demand
to drive up prices.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.545
But I have a plan
that'll solve that problem

06:51.579 --> 06:53.981
and also increase our revenue.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.983
We form a consortium

06:56.016 --> 06:57.918
with other health care providers

06:57.951 --> 07:00.988
and manufacture saline
ourselves.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.957
You're talking
about creating a new company.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.494
That's a big undertaking.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.928
Well, the numbers
will support the risk.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.296
I'm not worried
about the numbers.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.431
You don't have enough experience

07:11.465 --> 07:14.502
-as CEO to pull this off.
-You know, I have

07:14.535 --> 07:17.304
a pretty firm grasp on
what I can and cannot handle.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.673
Well, I don't see it happening,
Dr. Bell.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.441
We're tabling it.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.411
That's... Yeah.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.814
That's a...
Didn't realize

07:26.847 --> 07:31.084
we'd dispensed
with Robert's Rules of Order.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.853
MARSHALL:
Very well.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.855
All those in favor

07:34.888 --> 07:38.291
of letting Dr. Bell proceed
with the consortium?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
Great. Let's turn to page two.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.644
You stacked the deck.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.311
Well played.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.548
I'll be joining you today
at the conference

08:00.581 --> 08:03.717
to meet the CEOs you hope
will be our future partners.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.953
I insist we travel together.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.288
In my jet.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.323
Looking forward to it.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.127
MAN:
I've been struck by lightning.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.829
DEVON:
I don't see any burns
on the skin.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.565
-Nope.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.032
Strong as an ox.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.501
How about any hearing
or vision loss?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.170
Is that a crack at my age, son?

08:23.203 --> 08:24.572
No, sir.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.074
-Yup.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.076
-Bad ticker.
-I see you had

08:29.109 --> 08:31.511
a defibrillator
and a pacemaker put in.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.248
Oh!

08:35.282 --> 08:37.050
See? Struck by lightning.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.019
Your defibrillator is going off.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.354
The pain that you're feeling is
from the electrical shock.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.023
We'll run some tests,
and I'll call

08:43.056 --> 08:44.391
the company
that made the device

08:44.424 --> 08:45.659
and have them bring
in some equipment

08:45.693 --> 08:47.060
to run a diagnostic, okay?

08:47.094 --> 08:50.163
-I got the card right here.
-Great.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.332
Um, I see
your surgeon was Dr. Austin.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.767
Didn't he explain
how defibrillators work?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.235
He used big words.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.872
When he started talking,
I stopped listening.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.174
Okay. Be right back.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.710
BELL:
Dr. Austin,

09:02.743 --> 09:07.080
your billing with the Titian--
non-existent.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.117
I am aware. Good talk.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.685
The Titian's
a two million dollar machine.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.121
Chastain needs to make a return
on its investment.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.689
Well, the former
is not my fault,

09:15.723 --> 09:17.190
the latter is not my concern.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.959
Your contract
has a billing quota.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.560
Which I exceed consistently.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.395
Okafor, show him the numbers.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.931
Why would I have those numbers?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.733
Somewhere,
someone's got numbers.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.400
Take a gander. Good talk.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.437
The quota includes
robotic surgeries.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.039
Every surgeon has learned

09:32.072 --> 09:34.274
and started billing
with the Titian except you.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.610
Well, I'll tell you what.
You find me a study

09:36.644 --> 09:38.879
that shows that
the robotic approach is better

09:38.912 --> 09:42.082
than the standard CT surgery,
and I will consider it.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.951
Consider this:
everyone's replaceable

09:43.984 --> 09:45.986
if they don't play ball,
even you.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.457
Good talk.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.267
I can't seem to catch my breath.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.835
I feel like I ran a marathon.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.672
Dr. Hawkins,
do you see anything?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.140
Well, I don't see any overt
signs of organ rejection,

10:07.174 --> 10:09.109
but we'll need
to do a more extensive scan,

10:09.142 --> 10:11.078
some blood work,
maybe even a biopsy.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.684
BP 85/60, heart rate 130.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.823
Tamponade.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.325
Well, how bad is this? Tell me.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.160
Fluid has built up
around the heart.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.528
It's keeping the heart from

10:28.561 --> 10:30.163
beating normally.
We need to drain it.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.631
Let's get her upstairs.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.442
It's gonna be okay.
It's just a bump in the road.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.179
-Team Johnna can handle this.
-You know I prefer "BriaJohn."

10:46.213 --> 10:49.182
I'm good
with whatever you want.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.818
I, uh... I still don't
understand

10:50.851 --> 10:52.619
about the fluid
around her heart?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.554
It's probably been there
for weeks and getting worse.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.189
Is this related
to her transplant?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.391
Not sure yet,
but certain medications

10:58.425 --> 11:00.360
or inflammation can cause
fluid build-up.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.630
We'll send out the fluid
for analysis to figure it out.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.566
JOHN:
Uh, Dr. Hawkins, you're, uh,
you're a resident, right?

11:06.599 --> 11:09.002
Shouldn't an attending be
supervising this procedure?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.571
BRIANNA:
You strong-armed
Dr. Hawkins into

11:11.604 --> 11:13.006
taking my case.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.142
Now he's not qualified
to be my doctor?

11:15.175 --> 11:18.011
Hey, don't worry. I've done this
procedure hundreds of times.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.379
NIC:
She's in good hands.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.549
I should know. I was there
the first time he did it.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.255
Sounds like
a pericardial tamponade.

11:35.228 --> 11:39.099
You're right.
I need an 18-gauge spinal needle

11:39.132 --> 11:40.667
and a 60cc syringe
to drain the fluid.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.369
Whoa, whoa. You're an intern.
You can't do procedures

11:42.402 --> 11:44.371
-unsupervised.
-Well, while we wait for
the attending to come down,

11:44.404 --> 11:47.374
the patient will die.
So, you help me,

11:47.407 --> 11:48.742
or you get out of my way.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.411
Careful, Hawkins.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.746
You're gonna
need people like me.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.151
Somebody get me an IV.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.676
*

12:36.623 --> 12:39.092
Looks like you just went rogue
to save a patient.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.628
Wouldn't be the first time.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.731
Whenever you're free,
I'd like...

12:44.764 --> 12:46.800
Friday at 8:00.
I'll eat pretty much anything.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.169
I hate white tablecloths,
so let's keep it casual.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.774
*

13:03.951 --> 13:06.653
JOHN:
Thank you.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.092
I've been looking into
the three CEOs

13:12.125 --> 13:14.194
you said were interested
in starting

13:14.227 --> 13:16.496
a new saline company
with Chastain.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.298
Not necessary.

13:18.331 --> 13:21.334
I'm handling it.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.371
Sarah?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.376
1947 Sager.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.744
30 grand a bottle.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.984
So, you're meeting them
at the conference to pitch them.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.386
-Yeah.
-It's a big deal.

13:39.419 --> 13:43.056
-You know,

13:43.090 --> 13:45.492
when you've held someone else's
life in your hands

13:45.525 --> 13:48.328
as many times as I have,
you don't get nervous.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.299
To a successful pitch.

13:52.332 --> 13:56.036
You know, we want the same thing
for Chastain.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.406
In one instance,
we temporarily disagree.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.408
Let's move on.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.046
Club soda.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.023
Okafor, I better be here

14:16.056 --> 14:18.058
to watch you build
a Barbie Dreamhouse.

14:18.091 --> 14:21.028
You're not. You're here
to learn how to use the Titian.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.829
Did you not understand me
earlier?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.999
I'll try using different words.
I operate with these.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.535
-They're better than any robot.
-Yes, I understood you.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.937
Did you understand Bell?

14:29.970 --> 14:33.673
Uh, his mouth was moving,
but I wasn't listening.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.843
Everybody loves a shiny toy.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.180
They'll spend double, triple,
thousands more

14:40.213 --> 14:42.349
for a mindless, metal cyborg.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.417
But the patient's outcome
is no better.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.254
-This thing is a
two million dollar rip-off.
-Hmm.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.889
You pretend
to have high-minded motives

14:49.923 --> 14:52.092
for refusing this machine,

14:52.125 --> 14:53.593
but I know the truth.

14:55.963 --> 14:59.332
You can't do this.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.802
I can teach you.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.775
Be careful.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.015
Let me introduce myself.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.885
I am Dr. AJ Austin,

15:18.918 --> 15:20.820
triple board certified,

15:20.853 --> 15:23.323
named top CT surgeon

15:23.356 --> 15:25.925
by U.S. News & World Report
four times.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.164
Chastain has given me
the nickname "The Raptor."

15:31.198 --> 15:34.167
I don't know who came up
with it, but I like it.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.469
The raptor is a bird of prey,

15:36.503 --> 15:40.273
ruthless, intelligent,
king of the sky,

15:40.307 --> 15:43.143
slave to none.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.087
So...

15:54.121 --> 15:56.789
let's not forget
who's the teacher

15:56.823 --> 15:58.525
and who's the student.

15:58.558 --> 16:02.795
Lesson for today:
never underestimate The Raptor.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.372
Irving said you haven't RSVP'd
to the party

16:12.405 --> 16:14.041
at the 404 Tavern.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.343
Oh, sorry.
I must have forgotten.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.111
BRIANNA:
Somebody help!

16:24.317 --> 16:26.119
-CONRAD: He's wheezing.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.854
We need to get your husband
to the ER.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.490
Coming in with oxygen.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.891
Let's get him up.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.494
Okay. All right.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.699
-CONRAD: Here you go.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.734
NIC:
There we go.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.137
I want to be with him.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.139
No, no. It's better
if you stay here.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.008
-You take him.
I'll stay with Brianna.
-Okay.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.315
Thank you.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.750
They've stabilized him,
and he's being admitted.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.822
-Well,

17:02.855 --> 17:05.658
since John's experiencing
the same pulmonary issues

17:05.692 --> 17:07.560
as you, I'm wondering

17:07.594 --> 17:09.196
if you caught
the same infection.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.697
You said you got married
recently.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.998
Where did you honeymoon?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.766
The Big Island, Hawaii.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.035
Spent most of the time
in the hotel.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.273
I feel so selfish...

17:20.307 --> 17:23.243
not making him see a doctor.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.612
I had no idea he was this sick.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.214
John loves you.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.250
I'm sure he was just trying
to show you that

17:30.283 --> 17:32.385
by putting you first.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.954
He feels guilty.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.557
He cheated on me
when we were dating,

17:37.590 --> 17:39.859
and I left him.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.728
We weren't together anymore

17:41.761 --> 17:44.564
when I was diagnosed
with liver disease.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.634
And yet he still volunteered
to be your organ donor?

17:49.669 --> 17:53.306
It was the worst time
in my life.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.643
I don't know where I'd be
if he hadn't been there.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.954
New Year's party started early.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.059
-Sorry.
-No, it's not your fault.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.062
You've been amazing.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.432
Conrad, I have everything
I need. I'm okay.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.768
You don't have to stay here
all night.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.204
I'm not going anywhere.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.478
Wish there was more I could do.

18:35.348 --> 18:38.318
I felt off yesterday.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.856
Conrad, I'm so sorry.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.659
Please,

18:46.693 --> 18:48.528
-don't.
-I should have gone
to see my doctor.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.431
The miscarriage
is not your fault.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.033
There is nothing
anyone could have done.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.703
These things...
they just happen,

18:56.736 --> 18:59.472
and no one knows why.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.152
What would you
have wanted to do?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.700
We will get through this.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.413
DEVON:
Mr. Yokum,

19:40.447 --> 19:42.915
this is Julian Booth,
device rep from QuoVadis,

19:42.949 --> 19:44.684
the company that made

19:44.717 --> 19:46.386
your dual pacemaker
and ICD device.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.687
She's here to check it

19:47.720 --> 19:49.656
and, if necessary,
help us fix it, okay?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.157
-Yes, sir.
-DEVON: All right, perfect.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.559
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yokum.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.160
Hi, sweetheart.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.229
You're about to unbreak
my metal heart.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.665
-You call me Hugh.
Okay, Hugh.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.269
-Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, thank you.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.738
This will be quick
and painless, I promise.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.740
I can wirelessly

20:07.774 --> 20:10.477
pull information from
the defibrillator's hard drive.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.784
The defibrillator is misfiring.

20:17.817 --> 20:21.854
It'll need to be replaced.
Was this implanted at Chastain?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.391
Dr. Austin put it in.
Big guy.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.726
Rude.
Took my hat away.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.761
Dude tried to wear
a cowboy hat in the OR.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.063
I'll get started
on pre-op labs.
-Well, good.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.632
We will schedule surgery
as soon as they come back.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.268
-Do you have a replacement
for the device?
-Ready to go.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.136
All right. Alert me
if there are any complications.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.806
I was with Hugh
when the defibrillator went off.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.774
It seemed extreme to me.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.310
Are there cases
when an ICD device

20:43.343 --> 20:46.112
misfired so badly that the shock
killed the patient?

20:46.145 --> 20:48.214
I've never heard
of that happening.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.884
But it is possible, isn't it?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.220
There's a phenomenon known as
"the cure is the cause."

20:54.253 --> 20:55.922
When the treatment results
in more problems

20:55.955 --> 20:57.890
than the disease itself. That's
not what's happening here.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.327
I think you're overreacting.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.261
All right.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.071
I really don't understand
your problem with the Titian.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.107
It's capable of steady
and precise movements.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.177
Oh, yuck. Look who's toeing
the company line.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.847
-Ooh!
-I don't want him to fire you.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.682
Do what Bell wants.
Human hands, robotic hands,

21:22.715 --> 21:24.984
cutting is cutting.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.153
Pay attention, Okafor.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.756
Robots literally
and figuratively

21:29.789 --> 21:31.624
stand in between
me and the patient.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.160
So, no, all cutting
is not the same.

21:34.193 --> 21:35.762
Not to me.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.332
And it shouldn't be to you.
And trust me,

21:39.366 --> 21:40.967
Bell is not gonna fire me.
I am too valuable,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.268
-and he knows it.
-Yeah.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.472
His ego is as big,
if not bigger, than yours.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.807
Firing you
may not be the smart thing,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.308
but he'll do it
just to prove a point.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.177
-That he

21:51.210 --> 21:53.045
is the most powerful person
in the room.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.982
So if you don't sacrifice
your beliefs, the next stop

21:56.015 --> 21:58.818
on your locum tenens journey
will be Who Cares, New Jersey.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.791
So, what you got against Jersey?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.159
We compared your X-rays
and other tests.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.529
You both have significant
pulmonary damage.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.197
We believe
it's because of an infection,

22:11.230 --> 22:13.132
but we don't know
what caused it.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.467
So we'll look
at your travel history,

22:14.501 --> 22:15.902
see if anything sticks out.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.904
Even though Brianna
has a compromised immune system

22:17.937 --> 22:20.006
due to the drugs she takes
to avoid organ rejection,

22:20.039 --> 22:22.008
John's lungs
are in a worse shape.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.444
NIC:
Which may mean that John
got the infection first.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.014
Something you want to share
with the class?

22:29.616 --> 22:32.118
I have a crazy itch down there.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.523
All right, let me see.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.698
You have a rash.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.033
Since we seem to share
all our symptoms,

22:47.066 --> 22:48.234
why don't I have a rash?

22:48.267 --> 22:50.236
Maybe John got his

22:50.269 --> 22:52.004
doing something without you.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.207
We were on our honeymoon,
we did everything together.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.410
Didn't we?

22:57.444 --> 22:59.512
You didn't sneak out
of our hotel room

22:59.546 --> 23:02.348
while I was asleep?
That's not an STD, is it?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.016
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.618
-Keep your oxygen mask on.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.687
BRIANNA:
What, the waitress
from our hotel?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.055
The guide from our tour?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.959
John. John?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.427
NIC:
We need to intubate.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.362
70 of roc,
20 of etomidate.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.131
John!
What's going on?

23:19.165 --> 23:21.634
CONRAD:
He can't breathe.
We need to do it for him.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.970
John.

23:24.003 --> 23:27.106
I am thrilled you've agreed,
in principle,

23:27.139 --> 23:30.076
to partner with Chastain.
We'll produce our own saline,

23:30.109 --> 23:32.812
get out from under monopoly,
help our patients,

23:32.845 --> 23:34.647
and make a few dollars
along the way.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.749
-Cheers.
-Hear, hear.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.751
So sorry to intrude
on the celebration.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.889
Everyone,
this is Marshall Winthrop.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.957
He is the chairman of the board
at Chastain Park Memorial.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.494
These three amazing CEOs...

23:47.527 --> 23:49.328
Oh, I know who they are.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.799
Apparently better
than you do, Randolph.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.834
Dr. Curtis, does your board know

23:54.867 --> 23:58.170
that you're being investigated
for massive tax evasion?

23:58.204 --> 24:01.941
Mr. Price,
you have quite the résumé.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.410
BA from Harvard.
MBA from Wharton.

24:04.443 --> 24:08.014
Tell me, how is the weather
in Arizona,

24:08.047 --> 24:10.983
where you actually
went to college?

24:11.017 --> 24:14.654
And Kevin Finnerman,
you have driven your hospital

24:14.687 --> 24:16.923
to the brink of bankruptcy

24:16.956 --> 24:19.325
with administration overhead

24:19.358 --> 24:22.428
that crushes what you spend
in patient care.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.699
You don't have the coin
to partner with anyone.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.968
Stick to what you know

24:29.001 --> 24:31.437
and leave the business
of business

24:31.470 --> 24:33.806
to the big boys.

24:41.380 --> 24:45.317
John's getting a chest CT
and a little test for STDs.

24:45.351 --> 24:48.054
Syphilis or chlamydia
could explain his symptoms.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.956
Yeah. If he passed something on
to Brianna,

24:49.989 --> 24:51.924
it'll explain hers, too.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.127
You okay?

24:55.161 --> 24:57.496
She was holding on to
a honeymoon,

24:57.530 --> 24:59.699
when maybe there never
should've been a marriage.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.367
John says he's changed.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.169
Let's give him the benefit
of the doubt.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.237
They went through so much.
Things changed.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.273
I'm not sure that people can.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.180
Are we still
talking about the patient?

25:15.915 --> 25:19.485
We broke up because we had
issues, and then Lily died,

25:19.518 --> 25:21.721
and your dad came back,
I got arrested.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.890
If those things didn't happen,

25:23.923 --> 25:25.858
do you think we'd be
back together?

25:25.892 --> 25:28.160
Uh, yes.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.162
Of course.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.031
Don't you?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.569
I don't know.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.908
I'll let you know
when John's results come in.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.183
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

25:51.217 --> 25:55.121
I'm honored to be here among
the tribe I value most:

25:55.154 --> 25:57.089
doctors, health care
professionals,

25:57.123 --> 25:59.458
dedicated to making their
patients' lives better.

25:59.491 --> 26:02.428
We make decisions when a life
hangs in the balance.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.464
We treat and cure, all while
risking unfounded blame

26:05.497 --> 26:07.566
and lawsuits.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.135
But I'm here today

26:09.168 --> 26:12.104
not to list
our challenges and virtues

26:12.138 --> 26:14.641
but to issue a clarion call

26:14.674 --> 26:17.409
to this group
that I consider heroes.

26:17.443 --> 26:20.079
It's time for us to suit up

26:20.112 --> 26:22.248
and take on a new fight,

26:22.281 --> 26:24.050
and we need to do it together.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.886
Because bad things
are happening in our world,

26:26.919 --> 26:30.757
and we can't fix them
because we've lost control.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.960
We've surrendered our power to
the medical industrial complex,

26:33.993 --> 26:37.229
and it is time to show those
who would stand in the way

26:37.263 --> 26:40.166
of the common good that we will
no longer surrender.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.835
It is up to us,
not ignorant businessmen,

26:42.869 --> 26:44.503
to fight that good fight.

26:44.536 --> 26:47.674
I suggest we can do it
by solving a simple problem.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.677
Hospitals cannot get ahold
of one of the cheapest

26:50.710 --> 26:53.946
and most effective treatments
on Earth: saline solution.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.815
There's a handful of companies

26:55.848 --> 26:58.250
that control the market.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.853
They hold us all hostage.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.621
We need to change that.

27:08.695 --> 27:12.631
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.
I got your page.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.767
The Raptor is here to help.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.669
Let's just say
I'm embracing the nickname.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.137
Our patient has acute

27:18.170 --> 27:20.639
-respiratory failure.
-I'm aware.

27:20.673 --> 27:24.110
Listen, as someone who has gone
toe-to-toe with Bell and won,

27:24.143 --> 27:26.679
I need your advice
on how to handle a situation.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.148
He wants me to start billing
with the Titian.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.484
It's a machine I loathe
as if it were a real person.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.453
I agree.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.622
But if I don't use it,
he says he'll fire me.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.657
Well, then you got a choice
to make. You do what Bell says

27:38.691 --> 27:41.060
and save your job,
or stand up for your principles

27:41.093 --> 27:42.729
and risk getting fired.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.364
Okay, that's not the answer
I was looking for.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.766
That's all I got.

27:48.768 --> 27:52.571
Whoa. Looks like your man John
needs a bronchoscopy, stat.

27:52.604 --> 27:55.174
Look at those lungs.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.843
Most of it looks chronic.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.845
This means John's health was
impaired before his honeymoon.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.346
Oh, long before, brother.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.848
Based on this scan,
I'd say his lungs

28:01.881 --> 28:03.649
have been taking a beating
for years.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.551
But why did John and Brianna's
symptoms only develop

28:05.584 --> 28:06.819
after they got back
from the honeymoon?

28:06.853 --> 28:08.520
Well, I don't know,
but the Raptor

28:08.554 --> 28:10.022
does not envy you right now.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.058
CONRAD:
John's organs are shutting down.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.425
First his lungs,
now his kidneys.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.369
Did you get Hugh's
pre

28:23.402 --> 28:26.172
Um... any second.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.441
I'm sorry if I was
a little short earlier.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.877
I love my work.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.245
-I get defensive.
-Understandable.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.747
Admirable, too.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.883
I hear you have
a wedding coming up.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.550
You studying up
to do a Bollywood dance

28:38.584 --> 28:40.953
Yeah.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.422
My fiancée, Priya, insists.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.058
I don't want to disappoint her,
but I...

28:46.092 --> 28:47.693
-I have two left feet.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.362
-Well, maybe I can help.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.630
I was a dancer, remember?

28:52.899 --> 28:55.001
Page Dr. Austin.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.772
His heart rate's dropping.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.442
Get the pacer pads.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.577
His device
has completely failed.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.113
Start pacing at 80.

29:11.784 --> 29:14.120
His pressure's too low.

29:14.153 --> 29:17.123
-It's not capturing.
-Pravesh, talk to me.

29:17.156 --> 29:19.458
-His device isn't working.
-He needs a transvenous pacer.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.227
Well, in my infinite wisdom,

29:21.260 --> 29:22.728
I ordered these on the way down.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.263
Pravesh, suit up.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.264
I'll talk you through it.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.298
Come on, let's go.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.607
Now, access the right internal

29:35.641 --> 29:37.443
jugular vein
with the finder needle.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.783
Good.
Now advance the guidewire.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.454
Okay,

29:48.487 --> 29:52.124
and guide the catheter
over the wire.

29:52.158 --> 29:55.494
-Remove the wire.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.696
Stay cool, Pravesh.
Don't look at the monitor.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.465
Listen to me.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.367
Now insert the wire
and inflate the balloon.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.475
Grab the pacer generator.
Set the heartbeat to 80,

30:09.508 --> 30:11.543
and the output at ten milliamps.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.016
Slowly advance, Pravesh.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.317
Keep going.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.988
Keep going...

30:22.021 --> 30:23.289
There.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.494
Blood pressure's back to normal.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.230
Deflate the balloon.
Dial back on the output.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.234
All right, let's get this guy
up to ICU and change his device.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.071
But for now, you saved his life.

30:39.105 --> 30:41.140
Well done.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.042
You're a natural.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.349
-Yes, but we're still gonna keep

30:50.382 --> 30:51.550
a close eye on you.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.585
I feel bad for leaving him.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.054
I should be doing something.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.422
The best thing to do
is help figure out

30:56.455 --> 30:57.856
what you've both been
exposed to.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.491
John's lungs
were severely damaged

30:59.525 --> 31:01.894
-long before your honeymoon.
-But your symptoms didn't start

31:01.928 --> 31:04.096
until after you returned home.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.831
-We're missing something.
-I told you everything

31:05.864 --> 31:07.733
I can remember about
our medical history.

31:07.766 --> 31:10.336
All right. Well, then,
let's trace backwards.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.870
When was the last time
you were sick?

31:11.904 --> 31:15.441
Uh, we both had a cold
around the holidays

31:15.474 --> 31:17.443
and a bout of food poisoning
a month ago.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.778
-Undercooked chicken.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.847
John took it off
the stove too soon

31:21.880 --> 31:24.450
because it was smoking out
the kitchen.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.418
I lived with him in that house
for two years,

31:26.452 --> 31:27.853
and every time he cooks
something with oil,

31:27.886 --> 31:29.621
the whole place
smells like smoke again,

31:29.655 --> 31:31.290
which makes John's cough
even worse.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.858
You've mentioned
his cough before.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.126
Has he had it for a while?

31:34.160 --> 31:35.561
Yes. It's been on and off

31:35.594 --> 31:37.429
since he bought the house
three years ago.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.865
We tested it for mold
but didn't find anything.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.533
I have the same cough,
but we figured

31:41.567 --> 31:44.470
it was just some sort
of allergy.

31:44.503 --> 31:47.239
We don't normally
do house calls,

31:47.273 --> 31:49.942
but do you mind
if we go have a look?

31:52.311 --> 31:54.313
BELL:
You're late.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.317
I had a few last-minute deals
to shore up.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.587
So, just for your information,

32:01.620 --> 32:03.289
after my speech,

32:03.322 --> 32:05.924
six new CEOs expressed interest
in starting

32:05.958 --> 32:07.893
-our own saline factory.
-We won't need them.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.796
I just bought
a manufacturing company

32:10.829 --> 32:13.432
to produce our own saline,
and I'm working

32:13.465 --> 32:17.003
on getting fast track approval
from the FDA.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.273
So you bought a factory...

32:21.307 --> 32:23.509
threw away
a much larger opportunity

32:23.542 --> 32:25.944
just to keep me
from having a win.

32:25.978 --> 32:29.781
I got into a business
with a proven track record.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.917
It's not all about you, Bell.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.953
That's something you seem to
have a hard time understanding.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.527
Club soda.

32:45.864 --> 32:48.500
NIC:
No weird smells. No animals.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.536
I don't see anything hazardous.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.771
John's STD test came back.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.306
Negative.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.343
Brianna will be relieved.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.111
Maybe he did change.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.980
Testing negative does not mean
that he didn't cheat,

33:02.014 --> 33:04.116
but we'll give him the benefit
of the doubt.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.685
Still, it can't be easy for her;
she never forgot

33:06.718 --> 33:09.488
how their relationship ended
the first time.

33:09.521 --> 33:12.224
Kind of like you never forgot
what happened at the 404 Tavern.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.295
Wish I could.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.696
Seriously, none of them?

33:17.729 --> 33:19.498
-None.
-Not even the first three.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.533
-I don't like lightsabers.
-Ugh.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.202
Okay, what about Battlestar--

33:23.235 --> 33:25.471
the concept of girl Starbuck,

33:25.504 --> 33:27.306
boy Starbuck--
that means nothing to you?

33:27.339 --> 33:28.740
What?

33:28.774 --> 33:31.810
Wow.
How has this never come up?

33:31.843 --> 33:33.212
I wish it hadn't.

33:33.245 --> 33:36.014
Okay. Clear your Saturday
and your Sunday.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.350
Movie marathon. Me and you.
It's happening.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.687
-You and me.
-Uh, all right.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.589
I'm gonna need
more beer for that.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.459
Pick your franchise.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.831
* Baby... *

33:52.864 --> 33:54.733
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

33:54.766 --> 33:57.169
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, Conrad.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.908
Conrad, stop.
Open the door.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.552
Do exactly
what I tell you to do.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.621
You go out there
and you apologize to the lady.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.656
-Unlock the door.
-NIC: Conrad!

34:19.057 --> 34:21.393
I'm really, really sorry.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.695
Stop it.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.697
He put his hands on you.
What do you expect me to do?

34:25.731 --> 34:27.399
Don't you pretend this has
anything to do with me.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.900
It's not the first time
I've seen you lose it like that.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.369
What are we doing?
Let's get out of here.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.371
-I'm fine.
-No, you are not fine!

34:32.404 --> 34:33.772
Nic, okay, I overreacted,
but you...

34:33.805 --> 34:35.574
you're doing the same thing
right now.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.543
You know, Conrad, the way that
you handle things scares me.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.711
-That's not fair.
-Whether it's Afghanistan,

34:39.745 --> 34:41.980
losing the baby...

34:42.013 --> 34:43.449
-Don't.
-No, you need to hear it.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.550
'Cause that's the truth.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.418
You bottle everything up inside.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.986
I never know
what you're thinking,

34:48.019 --> 34:49.988
I never know what you're
feeling, and now this?

34:50.021 --> 34:52.491
Dragging some guy
into a bathroom

34:52.524 --> 34:55.327
because some bomb goes off in
you, and I can't see it coming?

34:55.361 --> 34:57.663
This is not normal.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.073
I'm sorry, Conrad.
I can't...

35:08.106 --> 35:10.942
I can't do this anymore.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.445
CONRAD:
I'm not the same guy
I was back then.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.815
And I want to believe that.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.417
-I hope it'll be different.
-It will be.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.452
Because I'll be different.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.853
Do the work, get the help.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.489
You make me want to be
a better person.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.591
That's one of the reasons
why I love you.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.660
I know you love me, and I know

35:28.694 --> 35:32.198
that you believe
everything you just said.

35:34.032 --> 35:37.303
But if this is gonna work,
you need to believe it, too.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.707
Yeah.

35:44.476 --> 35:48.180
Sorry, I just realized
there's pottery

35:48.214 --> 35:50.048
all over the place.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.689
And I think
they make it themselves.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.626
Maybe somewhere in the house.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.161
Only one place left to look.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.146
CONRAD:
You developed a condition

36:21.179 --> 36:22.714
called chronic silicosis,

36:22.748 --> 36:24.883
scarring of the lungs
caused by inhaling silica.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.485
A mineral found in clay used
for pottery.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.821
You and John have been inhaling
harmful levels for years

36:29.855 --> 36:31.923
due to poor ventilation
in your workshop.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.525
John moved into the house first,

36:33.559 --> 36:35.727
so he was exposed
for a longer period.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.730
And that's why
he got sicker faster?

36:38.764 --> 36:41.233
But why didn't we get sick
until after our honeymoon?

36:41.267 --> 36:43.602
Volcanic ash is a trigger
for acute silicosis,

36:43.635 --> 36:45.537
which you inhaled
while you were in Hawaii.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.607
NIC:
It can take a few weeks
for symptoms to show up.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.276
And the rash?

36:50.309 --> 36:51.710
CONRAD:
The bronch on his lungs revealed

36:51.743 --> 36:52.944
an infection called nocardia.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.347
NIC:
You both got it in Bali,

36:55.381 --> 36:58.083
but it's more common for men
to develop a rash than women.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.786
CONRAD:
Silicosis and nocardia--
they're treatable.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.555
But John's chest CT
revealed an empyema--

37:03.589 --> 37:06.292
pus and dead tissue in the lung.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.194
He needs surgery.

37:09.227 --> 37:13.131
You have my consent.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.367
Go help my husband.

37:15.401 --> 37:19.204
BELL:
I hear you're doing
Mr. Candelora's empyema.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.139
We're heading to the OR now.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.741
I assume you're
using the Titian.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.776
Well, you know what they say
about assumptions.

37:24.810 --> 37:28.614
Dr. Austin, I was crystal clear.

37:30.148 --> 37:33.051
Yes. You were.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.254
And I made a medical decision
based on personal principles.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.890
I will forever
do the best job I can

37:38.924 --> 37:41.993
using the finest tools
available.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.229
Now, I assume
that a surgeon like you

37:44.262 --> 37:47.165
would understand that.
But, if not...

37:47.198 --> 37:48.767
fire me.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.602
I keep my bags packed
at all times.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.606
I think that's wise.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.483
This might be our last dance,
Okafor.

38:04.516 --> 38:07.419
If Bell was going to fire you,

38:07.453 --> 38:09.120
it would've just happened.

38:09.154 --> 38:12.190
So, not our last dance.

38:13.992 --> 38:17.028
CONRAD:
How was the conference?

38:17.062 --> 38:19.498
Oh, inspiring.
Educational.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.200
Your father's approach
to just about everything

38:22.233 --> 38:24.169
is an acquired taste.

38:24.202 --> 38:27.205
I'm gonna guess
he insinuated himself

38:27.238 --> 38:29.775
into whatever your plans were
for the saline shortage.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.843
Oh, Marshall, on his own,

38:31.877 --> 38:34.380
wrote a check, bought
a company-- just like that--

38:34.413 --> 38:37.182
to manufacture clean,
safe saline for Chastain.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.950
We'll never be short again.

38:38.984 --> 38:42.521
And now he'll sell the surplus
and make a killing.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.023
You know, you better
open your eyes.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.858
He's certainly here
to scorch the earth,

38:46.892 --> 38:48.494
but trust me,
he'll be sticking around

38:48.527 --> 38:51.530
to make a mint off
the carbon he creates.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.540
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

39:03.742 --> 39:05.577
CONRAD:
Long day?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.415
Yeah, it's not over.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.684
Got a couple more phone calls
to make, a few e-mails.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.454
-You can do it tomorrow.
-Not my style.

39:17.923 --> 39:20.392
Chastain isn't like other
companies you've taken over.

39:20.426 --> 39:25.096
I think I can handle anything
this hospital throws my way.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.332
Like a saline shortage?

39:27.365 --> 39:30.902
You might not believe this,
but I have no ill intent

39:30.936 --> 39:32.738
in starting the saline factory.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.473
I believe you.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.776
Well, I want to take
the olive branch,

39:37.809 --> 39:41.279
but I'm curious
where it came from.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.585
If I want people to believe
I've changed,

39:46.618 --> 39:49.154
I need to consider
that maybe you have, too.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.262
I, uh...

39:57.295 --> 40:00.298
hope you can see now that...

40:00.331 --> 40:03.101
you're a lot more like me
than you realize.

40:07.305 --> 40:11.042
Good night... son.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.480
Good night... Dad.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.059
*

40:29.961 --> 40:33.899
Is slow dancing
a part of Bollywood?

40:33.932 --> 40:35.300
JULIAN:
I just want to see how you move.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.835
Get the nerves out.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.436
We'll start
with something you know.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.408
Okay. Sounds good.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.611
Uh, let me just
apologize in advance

40:45.644 --> 40:47.445
for stepping on your feet.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.414
That's not gonna happen.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.416
Okay.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.351
*

40:54.853 --> 40:56.922
* I can feel it *

40:56.955 --> 40:58.356
Mm-hmm.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.991
* Coming on *

41:00.025 --> 41:03.595
* I think I want to change the *

41:03.629 --> 41:05.130
* Whole world *

41:05.163 --> 41:06.865
* Can you see... *

41:06.898 --> 41:09.100
I've been thinking about
creating my own medical device.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.638
Watching what you do
gave me the idea.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.640
You know,
there's a secret to this.

41:14.673 --> 41:17.475
People who dance well,
their lips don't move.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.945
* Coming on *

41:19.978 --> 41:22.848
* I think I want to change the *

41:22.881 --> 41:24.349
* Whole world *

41:24.382 --> 41:27.152
Well, I just want to say
one last thing.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.688
I think you're leading.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.890
That's why it's working.

41:34.425 --> 41:36.327
* It's all good, it's okay *

41:38.163 --> 41:39.798
DEVON:
Come on.

41:39.831 --> 41:44.202
Look how good you're doing.

41:44.235 --> 41:47.038
* I'll be there *

41:47.072 --> 41:49.007
* Through the night *

41:49.040 --> 41:51.577
* I can feel it *

41:51.610 --> 41:54.245
* Coming on... *

41:54.279 --> 41:55.847
You're here.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.318
I'm not going anywhere.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.822
Me neither.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.090
* Phenomenon *

42:05.123 --> 42:07.525
* Been living on a prayer *

42:07.559 --> 42:09.160
* All along *

42:09.194 --> 42:12.363
* All along, all along. *

42:16.234 --> 42:17.803
* I want you to move me *

42:19.537 --> 42:22.908
* Like we're
in Babylon tonight *

42:28.079 --> 42:30.716
* I want you to hear me *

42:30.749 --> 42:33.518
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.887
You're here.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.989
I'm here.

42:41.793 --> 42:44.295
I love you, too.

42:44.329 --> 42:45.964
* Yeah, I said, yeah *

42:45.997 --> 42:49.200
And I do think
it'll be different this time.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.203
* Angels and demons *

42:52.237 --> 42:55.540
* I have fallen *

42:55.573 --> 42:58.744
* Kicked from heaven *

42:59.745 --> 43:02.080
* Good-bye *

43:02.113 --> 43:04.315
* My only sin was *

43:04.349 --> 43:06.284
* To want you... *

43:06.317 --> 43:09.254
Are you ready
to go down in defeat?

43:09.287 --> 43:10.789
People may change,

43:10.822 --> 43:13.291
but I'm not sure
your pool game can be saved.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.826
Those are fighting words.

43:14.860 --> 43:18.129
I'll let my 12-game lead
do the talking.

43:18.163 --> 43:21.266
All right.
Watch this.

43:21.299 --> 43:24.569
-12 ball, corner pocket.
-Difficult shot.

43:24.602 --> 43:28.039
I seem to remember
you missing that one a lot.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.042
Not this time.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.984
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.053 --> 44:16.822
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.390
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.228
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:25.563 --> 44:27.899
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:27.933 --> 44:31.502
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *

44:31.536 --> 44:35.073
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:35.106 --> 44:36.141
MAN: Touchdown!

44:36.174 --> 44:39.711
* Reach out *

44:39.745 --> 44:43.348
* Make this right here
right now *

44:43.381 --> 44:46.284
* Stand up *

44:47.185 --> 44:48.920
* Here right now *

44:48.954 --> 44:50.789
That sounds like fun.
