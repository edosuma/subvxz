to make me move.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.060
Ahhhh!

21:02.127 --> 21:05.897
- What do you make of
those blueprints, Schwoz?

21:05.964 --> 21:08.066
Can that weapon
really destroy me?

21:08.133 --> 21:09.935
- I don't know what
they were talking about.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.571
These blueprints aren't for
an Omega weapon.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.139
They're for a toaster.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.874
- Dude, can a toaster
destroy you?

21:15.941 --> 21:19.077
- I don't know.
But tomorrow we should destroy

21:19.144 --> 21:23.782
all the toasters in Swellview
just to be safe.

21:23.849 --> 21:27.419
- There's some kind
of weird stain on here...

21:27.486 --> 21:29.021
- So... my demands.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.356
I demand that you
let me finish my senten--

21:31.423 --> 21:34.493
- Hey, how was your date with
Kim Danvers last night?

21:34.559 --> 21:36.028
- Ugh -- awful.
- Yeah.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.096
- In fact I'm gonna delete
her number right now.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.799
Because there's no way I'm
going to call Kim Danvers again.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.101
{\an8}PHONE VOICE:
Calling Kim Danvers again.

21:43.168 --> 21:46.038
{\an8}- No no no no no--

21:46.104 --> 21:47.472
{\an8}[ Kim Danvers on phone ]
- Heeeeeyyyyy...

21:47.539 --> 21:49.641
{\an8}- Hi, Kiiiimmm...

21:49.708 --> 21:51.910
{\an8}agaiiinnn...

21:54.112 --> 21:58.884
{\an8}[ music ]

21:58.950 --> 22:00.385
{\an8}I'll call you back.

22:00.452 --> 22:04.356
