04:18.759 --> 04:20.058
There's been an accident.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.329
Yes.

Yes.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.963
(door banging)

13:55.368 --> 13:56.568
- So where ya been?

13:57.737 --> 13:58.937
I haven't seen you
       since the funeral.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.271
(glasses clinking)
    - Ah, it's been a while.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.339
You know how it is.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.675
It's been a busy year.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.280
- Still building the
      better mousetrap.

14:22.829 --> 14:23.695
Electrical?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.031
- It's old wiring, fickle.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.334
- Well if you want, I could have

14:29.336 --> 14:30.635
one of my guys
       take a look at it.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.339
- I think I can
       handle it, thanks.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.406
Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt

14:35.408 --> 14:37.508
the family house Michael.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.378
- You still plan on keeping
  everything like it is?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.746
Last summer we talked
     about clearing out

14:41.748 --> 14:43.214
some of this old stuff.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.682
Maybe having an estate sale.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.619
A few of these things are
   actually worth something.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.787
We could see a little money.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.623
I know someone who
       could set it up.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.193
- No, I'm not in a hurry. Ma
 liked the house the way it is.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.761
It's very comforting to me.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.501
- Where you planning
      on stopping by?

15:03.503 --> 15:04.402
- Of course.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.338
- The kids would love to see ya.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.073
- It's Lily's birthday Saturday.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.944
- That's amazing,
       you never forget.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.013
Yeah, she's having
       some friends over.

15:15.015 --> 15:15.914
A party.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.118
I just wanted to do a family
  thing, but she's a teenager.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.421
Grace said she
      needs more friends.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.889
- Does she have a boyfriend?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.126
- I don't know.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.027
God, I hope not.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.076
It's not Lily I worry
     about, it's Grace.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.378
- Is she okay?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.513
- Well the truth is,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.716
we've been having some trouble.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.117
Grace and I, it's not good.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.321
- Well I'm sure
       it's just a phase.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.223
- I don't know.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.926
- Well maybe she just needs
  to get away for a bit.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.294
A change of scenery.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.996
- You know this town.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.999
She hasn't lived here
     for 100 years, so.

16:08.001 --> 16:08.933
- Well she agreed
       to move up here.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.169
It was a joint decision, no?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.070
- We all agreed.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.474
I thought we were
     doing the right thing.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.842
And the kids are fine, but

16:20.981 --> 16:22.580
she's just not that happy here.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.857
(atmospheric music)

16:41.501 --> 16:44.402
(engine whirring)

16:51.911 --> 16:56.981
(crickets chirping)
      (engine whirring)

17:07.660 --> 17:10.395
- [Man On Phone] Sure, whatever.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.663
Guess not.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.564
- Really?

17:15.035 --> 17:18.036
(man on phone speaking faintly)

17:18.038 --> 17:20.405
- I don't care, they can
    think what they want.

17:21.907 --> 17:25.977
(man on phone speaking faintly)

17:29.215 --> 17:31.249
It's not like that.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.183
- Lily?

17:33.653 --> 17:34.786
- Hold on Spencer.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.322
- [Man On Phone] She's crazy.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.325
- Lily, you said you're
    gonna come help me.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.693
- One minute (speaking
     in foreign language).

17:44.264 --> 17:45.163
- Come on.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.099
- [Man On Phone] What?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.434
- Okay.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.368
Hey, I gotta go.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.936
- Okay.
        - I'll text you

17:51.938 --> 17:53.337
before I go to bed.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.639
- [Man On Phone] Okay.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.673
- Okay.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.743
(crickets chirping)

18:01.081 --> 18:02.814
Sorry, Spencer.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.215
Let me see it.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.150
- There's someone outside.

18:06.152 --> 18:08.286
- Huh?
       - I saw somebody.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.254
(footsteps pattering)

18:10.256 --> 18:11.622
- Are you sure?

18:11.624 --> 18:14.592
- I'm sure, there's
      somebody outside.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.094
I saw someone.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.829
- [Lily] You're always
     making things up.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.964
- [Spencer] I saw them.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.535
I guess they're gone.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.071
- I don't see anything.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.309
- Lily, can you
       come help me now?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.478
Please?
            - Yeah.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.313
I'm coming.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.382
(atmospheric music)

18:42.021 --> 18:47.091
Okay, so.

18:48.394 --> 18:51.462
(speaking faintly).

18:54.434 --> 18:57.268
(pills rattling)

19:07.413 --> 19:10.248
(Marcus sighing)

19:11.985 --> 19:14.085
(pills rattling)

19:14.087 --> 19:16.888
(wind whistling)

19:18.725 --> 19:20.458
- I found this shell

19:21.294 --> 19:26.364
and I wanted to show you.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.868
(Marcus sighing)

19:30.870 --> 19:34.305
(floor creaking)

19:34.307 --> 19:36.207
(creature clattering)

19:36.209 --> 19:38.943
(jarring music)

19:41.114 --> 19:43.848
(ominous music)

19:55.728 --> 20:00.798
(atmospheric music)
      (bicycle rattling)

20:13.112 --> 20:16.280
(seagulls squawking)

20:18.051 --> 20:21.052
(blender whirring)

20:42.542 --> 20:44.075
Hey.

20:44.077 --> 20:44.942
- Lily.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.646
- Oh, don't, I'm sweaty.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.513
I'm gross.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.252
- Um,

20:56.889 --> 20:57.855
have on of these.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.925
(glasses clinking)

21:00.927 --> 21:02.493
Voila.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.161
- You remembered.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.196
- Of course.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.969
- Did Dad tell you we
     were having a party?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.772
- Have I ever forgotten
    your birthday?

21:18.544 --> 21:19.443
- Once

21:21.147 --> 21:22.880
when I was three,

21:22.882 --> 21:24.282
you sent me a tea set.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.617
It arrived a week late

21:26.619 --> 21:29.153
and had these pink
       flowers on it.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.822
I think you were in London.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.458
- You have a very good memory.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.268
I remembered.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.883
You look very more mature

21:58.885 --> 22:00.351
than the last time I saw you.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.521
- I was just a kid the
     last time you saw me.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.659
- Well you don't look
     like a kid anymore.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.095
(thunder rumbling)

22:11.097 --> 22:11.996
- Mm,

22:13.266 --> 22:14.165
oops.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.201
- Mm, huh.

22:18.071 --> 22:21.238
(seagulls squawking)

22:22.075 --> 22:24.275
Mm.
        (Lily giggling)

22:24.277 --> 22:25.743
How's our little scientist?

22:26.579 --> 22:29.080
- Mm, you know, he's Spencer.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.219
You saw him the other night.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.422
At our house.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.991
I saw you watching us.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.998
- I didn't want to intrude.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.472
(sighing)

22:54.474 --> 22:57.408
(thunder rumbling)

22:59.545 --> 23:02.146
- Well I should get going
   before it starts to pour.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.081
Thanks.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.787
Hey.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.958
Don't be a stranger, okay?

23:23.636 --> 23:26.637
(thunder rumbling)

23:33.312 --> 23:37.081
(lightning booming)

23:37.083 --> 23:42.153
(atmospheric music)
      (water running)

23:42.822 --> 23:45.189
(thunder rumbling)

24:33.206 --> 24:36.006
(dramatic music)

24:42.915 --> 24:45.082
(Marcus sighing)

25:12.879 --> 25:15.679

25:19.585 --> 25:22.286

25:22.288 --> 25:25.256

25:34.467 --> 25:37.201

25:39.171 --> 25:41.906

26:04.897 --> 26:07.731
(ants pattering)

26:32.825 --> 26:36.060
(car engine whirring)

27:07.660 --> 27:09.593
- I wouldn't ask if it
     wasn't an emergency.

27:09.595 --> 27:10.694
- Michael, slow down.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.463
- [Michael] Come on Spencer.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.531
It won't be more
        than a few days.

27:14.533 --> 27:15.799
And Lily will take
       care of Spencer,

27:15.801 --> 27:17.301
you don't have to do anything.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.469
- But I don't wanna stay here.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.637
- [Marcus] It's
     okay, buddy, come on.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.904
- [Michael] Come on, Spence.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.007
- Lily's gonna make
      us root beer floats.

27:25.378 --> 27:26.677
Come on.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.979
- [Michael] Be good.

27:28.981 --> 27:29.880
- Uh.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.855
- I brought my net.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.823
- Okay good, there's lot
    to catch around here.

27:40.826 --> 27:41.792
Spence?

27:41.794 --> 27:43.060
- [Lily] Oh, I got it.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.764
- Oh, careful.

27:46.766 --> 27:47.665
I got it.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.368
- I'm not playing
       a game with these.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.003
- I know, let's go.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.873
- She's leaving me, Marcus.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.107
- No, I'm sure that--

27:57.109 --> 27:58.108
- She went back to her
     parents in the city,

27:58.110 --> 28:00.477
so if I don't go now, it's over.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.546
I'm sorry to do this to you.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.081
- No, don't worry.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.916
Just, um, do what
       you have to do.

28:05.918 --> 28:06.984
I'll be fine, go.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.623
Michael.

28:12.625 --> 28:13.857
Why don't you use my place?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.325
I'm gonna call ahead
      with the doorman.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.860
- Are you sure?
        - Absolutely.

28:17.697 --> 28:18.629
- Well, thank you, Marcus.

28:18.631 --> 28:19.897
I appreciate it, I really do.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.331
And I'll call you
       when I'm settled.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.367
- Okay, take as much
   time as you need Michael.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.735
All is gonna be fine here.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.473
(engine whirring)

28:29.475 --> 28:32.209
(ominous music)

28:48.728 --> 28:50.360
Where is it?

28:50.362 --> 28:51.261
- Uncle M.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.836
- [Marcus] Whoa, what
     sort of bug is this?

28:58.838 --> 28:59.870
- That's not a bug,

28:59.872 --> 29:01.371
that's a Trilobite.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.873
They're extinct.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.475
(footsteps tapping)

29:04.477 --> 29:05.743
- Going somewhere?

29:05.745 --> 29:07.611
- Some friends of mine
     are gonna meet up.

29:07.613 --> 29:08.679
- You just got here.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.582
- I won't be long.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.717
You and Spencer can
    keep each other company.

29:14.687 --> 29:15.686
I have my cell.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.858
(Marcus sighing)

29:22.495 --> 29:23.327
You don't have to worry.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.561
- Do you have to go?

29:24.563 --> 29:26.396
- You're still my
       favorite uncle.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.701
- I'm your only uncle.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.504
(Lily chuckling)

29:35.074 --> 29:36.673
Okay, please don't be too late.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.445
- Hey.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.346
- Hey.

29:44.483 --> 29:45.315
- Are you good?

29:45.317 --> 29:47.117
- Yeah, sure.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.020
(engine whirring)

29:54.260 --> 29:58.228
- [Spencer] Boo, is
  everything going to be okay

30:02.368 --> 30:03.934
with Uncle Marcus?

30:06.872 --> 30:08.539
Should I be afraid?

30:17.082 --> 30:19.817
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
      whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.253
I remember this guy.

30:25.024 --> 30:25.923
Boo, right?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.193
Hello, Boo.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.931
I'm so glad that you're able
  to visit for a few days.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.603
Hey, how ya holdin' up?

30:39.605 --> 30:40.470
- Fine.

30:42.942 --> 30:46.143
- So Boo teaching these guys
  right here a thing or two?

30:47.279 --> 30:48.879
- They don't really
     like to play together.

30:48.881 --> 30:49.947
- Really?

30:49.949 --> 30:51.215
That's okay.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.217
Not everybody has to be
    part of a large group,

30:53.219 --> 30:57.187
some are just happy
      to be by themselves.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.623
- I like being by myself
    most of the time too.

31:01.660 --> 31:02.526
- So do I.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.995
Talk to your mom or dad today?

31:05.931 --> 31:07.431
- Yep.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.833
- Look, Spence, everything
  is gonna work out just fine.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.536
They're both gonna
       be home very soon.

31:13.706 --> 31:14.605
- Okay.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.944
- Nothing's gonna happen.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.446
Promise.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.147
Why don't you get
       some sleep, kiddo?

31:24.149 --> 31:27.351
- I was gonna wait up for Lily,

31:27.353 --> 31:29.753
but I guess I'm kinda tired.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.928
- Goodnight, Spence.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.496
- [Spencer] Goodnight.

31:42.835 --> 31:45.569
(ominous music)

31:46.705 --> 31:49.406
(wire snapping)

31:53.979 --> 31:57.180
(creature slithering)

31:59.051 --> 32:01.518
(clattering)

32:03.923 --> 32:06.256
(creature snarling)

32:06.258 --> 32:08.959
(water spraying)

32:08.961 --> 32:11.194
(banging)

32:20.439 --> 32:23.173
(intense music)

32:43.462 --> 32:44.695
I'm a monster.

32:47.232 --> 32:50.067
(water spraying)

33:14.093 --> 33:16.426
- You really got
       me going tonight.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.338
Hey, are you sure you don't

33:28.340 --> 33:30.841
wanna leave with a
       little something?

33:30.843 --> 33:32.442
I'm hurtin' here.

33:32.444 --> 33:33.510
- Maybe next time.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.520
- [Drew] Whatever.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.423
(engine whirring)

33:53.866 --> 33:56.433
(atmospheric music)

33:56.435 --> 33:59.503
(crickets chirping)

34:57.963 --> 35:01.098
(creature snarling)

35:18.450 --> 35:21.184
(ominous music)

35:25.691 --> 35:28.525
(Marcus gasping)

35:36.869 --> 35:39.603
(ominous music)

35:42.908 --> 35:45.809
(engine whirring)

36:08.033 --> 36:11.101
(atmospheric music)

36:14.740 --> 36:16.606
- Do you still
      think they'll hatch?

36:18.510 --> 36:19.743
- [Spencer] I doubt it.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.479
- Then why do you hold on to it?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.182
- [Spencer] I don't know.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.082
Hope.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.154
- That's the way I see you.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.455
Always with hope.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.996
(water sloshing)

36:45.337 --> 36:50.407
(boat horn blaring)
      (seagulls squawking)

37:06.992 --> 37:08.558
- What the hell
      are you doing here?

37:10.128 --> 37:12.762
- I got these at the candy
   shop around the corner.

37:12.764 --> 37:13.797
Sour balls.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.665
Would you like one?
      - Okay,

37:15.667 --> 37:16.600
I'd appreciate if you call

37:16.602 --> 37:17.968
before you just show up.

37:17.970 --> 37:19.703
- Of course.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.137
I just wanted to see
    how you were getting on.

37:21.139 --> 37:24.574
But you know that business
   has been tidied up.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.709
- Lower your voice.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.943
You should not be here.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.745
I am very well known
      here in this town.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.116
Okay?
         - I apologize.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.651
I'll come by your place later.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.253
- Please, just first,
     (pills rattling)

37:36.255 --> 37:37.320
call next time, okay?

37:37.322 --> 37:38.255
- Of course.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.323
Are you sure you don't want one?

37:40.325 --> 37:43.660
I love these things but
  sometimes they make me sick.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.562
(spitting)

37:45.564 --> 37:47.697
Let me know if you
      need anything else.

37:47.699 --> 37:51.501
A pretty dress, anything at all.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.877
(engine whirring)

38:09.087 --> 38:11.521
- [Marcus] You've got
     to ease the clutch up.

38:11.523 --> 38:14.424
(engine whirring)

38:16.228 --> 38:17.627
- My leg is too short.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.029
- No, that was much better.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.064
- No, it wasn't.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.466
(sighing)

38:23.468 --> 38:25.568
Why are you always
       so nice to me?

38:25.570 --> 38:27.804
- Because I feel
       so sorry for you.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.972
- Don't patronize me.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.175
(engine whirring)

38:32.177 --> 38:33.410
- Look, take a breath.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.413
(Lily exhaling)

38:36.415 --> 38:37.514
Let's do it again.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.751
All right, let the clutch in.

38:41.753 --> 38:42.986
- [Lily] It is.

38:42.988 --> 38:43.887
- All the way in.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.192
Now, slowly, let it out.

38:59.738 --> 39:02.806
(atmospheric music)

39:04.042 --> 39:06.943
(bushes rustling)

39:13.985 --> 39:15.985
- [Spencer] I can't eat anymore.

39:15.987 --> 39:16.886
I'm stuffed.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.156
- I need a nap.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.292
- But you said you
     were going to help me.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.929
- In a minute, okay babe?

39:25.931 --> 39:27.063
I'm so full.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.567
- You guys wanna go up and
 take a look at the lighthouse?

39:30.569 --> 39:31.601
- [Spencer] No.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.802
- No.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.304
Sorry Uncle M.

39:34.306 --> 39:36.039
- [Spencer] I gonna go play.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.408
(seagulls squawking)

39:38.410 --> 39:40.343
- Don't go too far.
      - Okay.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.916
(wind whistling)

39:46.918 --> 39:49.018
(seagulls squawking)

39:49.020 --> 39:51.855
(waves crashing)

40:08.039 --> 40:09.773
- If we met at different times,

40:11.443 --> 40:13.610
I mean, if like we
    didn't know each other,

40:15.914 --> 40:17.313
do you think we'd
      still meet somehow?

40:17.315 --> 40:18.214
- Stop it.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.451
- I'm serious.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.024
Like if you saw me
     across a crowded room,

40:29.161 --> 40:30.960
would you come over
      and talk to me?

40:34.466 --> 40:35.665
- Yeah, in another life,

40:35.667 --> 40:37.233
a lot of things
      would be different.

40:41.373 --> 40:42.238
- Like what?

40:45.610 --> 40:47.043
- You can't think like that.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.248
- Sure you can.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.118
I mean, I just did.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.763
It's like imagining you
   see things in the clouds.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.134
Okay, like, there.

41:15.740 --> 41:16.873
I see a horse.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.278
Are you gonna tell me
     I don't see a horse?

41:27.152 --> 41:28.551
- You're my niece.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.820
I love you not matter what.

41:40.198 --> 41:41.097
- Good.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.068
That's what I thought.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.137
(atmospheric music)

41:55.480 --> 41:58.181
(water running)

42:11.563 --> 42:14.197
(Lily humming)

42:15.967 --> 42:18.935
(mirror squeaking)

42:30.048 --> 42:35.118
(Lily singing in
       foreign language)

42:35.787 --> 42:38.755
(ice cubes clinking)

42:38.757 --> 42:43.059
(Lily singing in
       foreign language)

43:10.755 --> 43:12.922
(water dripping)

43:12.924 --> 43:15.725
(waves crashing)

43:30.442 --> 43:31.975
(stapler clacking)

43:31.977 --> 43:35.044
(lightning booming)

43:37.482 --> 43:40.450
(stapler clacking)

43:44.723 --> 43:46.389
What are you doing?

43:47.492 --> 43:49.392
- There's a short
       here somewhere.

43:50.829 --> 43:51.761
Try the doorbell.

43:57.202 --> 44:00.036
(rain pattering)

44:02.407 --> 44:03.206
- Nothing.

44:07.912 --> 44:09.445
- I've changed all the fuses.

44:15.353 --> 44:17.754
- You know it's,
       it's raining out.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.622
We should just play
      like we used to.

44:20.692 --> 44:21.591
- Okay.

44:29.534 --> 44:33.169
- [Lily And Spencer]
     One, two, three, four,

44:33.171 --> 44:35.672
- You're back at hiding.
    - Five, six, seven,

44:35.674 --> 44:39.742
- [Lily And Spencer]
    eight, nine, 10, 11, 12,

44:39.744 --> 44:42.412
13, 14, 15,
      (lightning cracking)

44:42.414 --> 44:46.382
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

44:46.384 --> 44:48.151
Ready or not, here we come.

44:49.654 --> 44:51.320
- Okay, I'm gonna go this
   way, you go that way.

44:51.322 --> 44:52.588
- Why can't we go together?

44:53.658 --> 44:55.158
- Oh, it'll just
      be faster this way.

44:55.160 --> 44:58.294
(lightning cracking)

44:59.464 --> 45:02.331
(stairs creaking)

45:03.568 --> 45:06.302
(ominous music)

45:31.262 --> 45:34.263
(thunder rumbling)

45:37.001 --> 45:41.037
(Marcus breathing heavily)

45:41.039 --> 45:44.207
(lightning cracking)

46:02.594 --> 46:03.760
He's going upstairs.

46:07.966 --> 46:10.967
(thunder rumbling)

46:20.078 --> 46:23.713
- [Marcus] There's
       something on me.

46:23.715 --> 46:26.382
- Where, there's nothing there.

46:27.152 --> 46:28.317
Shh.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.786
He's gonna hear us.

46:29.788 --> 46:32.955
(lightning cracking)

46:43.535 --> 46:46.102
- There's something in
    here, Lily, let me out.

46:46.104 --> 46:49.005
- No, shh, okay, hold it.

46:49.007 --> 46:52.074
(atmospheric music)

47:07.992 --> 47:11.527
(floor creaking)

47:11.529 --> 47:14.063
- Lily, there's
   something on me, I think.

47:14.065 --> 47:15.565
(lightning booming)

47:15.567 --> 47:18.668
Something's in here, let me out!

47:18.670 --> 47:19.902
No, no!

47:19.904 --> 47:22.638
(intense music)

47:23.675 --> 47:24.874
- There's nothing there Uncle M.

47:24.876 --> 47:26.409
See, it's all right.

47:26.411 --> 47:27.677
It's an old coat.

47:27.679 --> 47:28.578
See?

47:33.351 --> 47:36.085
(ominous music)

47:41.526 --> 47:44.527
(kettle whistling)

47:54.005 --> 47:56.906
(dishes clacking)

48:01.813 --> 48:03.613
I brought you tea.

48:03.615 --> 48:05.114
- Oh, I'm fine,

48:05.116 --> 48:06.983
but thanks for thinking of me.

48:08.987 --> 48:10.353
- You're not feeling well?

48:10.355 --> 48:11.387
- No, it's nothing.

48:12.323 --> 48:13.956
Nothing the sea air won't cure.

48:16.327 --> 48:17.693
- I wish you lived here.

48:19.097 --> 48:19.996
- But I do.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.168
- I mean like, all the time.

48:27.472 --> 48:30.306
- Now that's just the
  little girl in you talking.

48:32.210 --> 48:35.778
If I lived here, you would get
 bored with me very quickly.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.451
- I wished we lived
      here together.

48:52.130 --> 48:54.030
Whatever happened
       to Aunt Cassie?

48:58.036 --> 48:59.969
- Oh, it was a long time ago.

49:03.574 --> 49:05.675
- I used to be so
       jealous of her.

49:07.211 --> 49:11.948
Of how pretty and lucky she was.

49:18.523 --> 49:19.422
- Really?

49:21.192 --> 49:22.291
You should go to bed.

49:30.101 --> 49:31.000
Goodnight.

49:32.937 --> 49:33.836
- Goodnight.

49:41.512 --> 49:44.580
(crickets chirping)

49:48.019 --> 49:50.786
Okay, just let me know
    when you're coming back.

49:50.788 --> 49:54.023
(Grace speaking faintly)

49:54.025 --> 49:55.691
Mm, sure.

49:55.693 --> 49:56.792
Goodnight.

49:56.794 --> 49:58.494
(Grace speaking faintly)

49:58.496 --> 50:00.096
All right, Mom, I love you too.

50:05.737 --> 50:09.972
(speaking in foreign language)

50:09.974 --> 50:11.207
- I lost time.

50:12.143 --> 50:13.075
It leaves, mm.

50:13.077 --> 50:14.910
- Spencer, wake up.

50:14.912 --> 50:15.811
Are you okay?

50:17.548 --> 50:19.482
Hey.
      - What does it mean?

50:19.484 --> 50:21.117
I don't understand.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.553
Boys can't have babies, right?

50:26.991 --> 50:29.058
- (chuckling) No.

50:29.060 --> 50:31.894
(floor creaking)

50:33.331 --> 50:35.231
- What were you talking about?

50:35.233 --> 50:38.667
- Nothing, I was
      just talking to Mom.

50:44.308 --> 50:45.775
- What is it Boo?

50:48.713 --> 50:51.247
What are these two talking
   about so late at night?

50:53.584 --> 50:56.419
Hmm, what secrets
       are they keeping?

50:59.590 --> 51:00.456
Come on, Boo.

51:02.026 --> 51:03.092
You can tell me.

51:03.094 --> 51:04.693
- He doesn't wanna go with you.

51:05.997 --> 51:07.129
- Is that true Boo?

51:10.034 --> 51:11.834
After all we've been through,

51:11.836 --> 51:15.204
I just thought you and
    I were best of friends.

51:18.676 --> 51:20.142
- He says you're a monster.

51:21.379 --> 51:22.344
- What did he say?

51:24.348 --> 51:25.781
- He didn't say anything.

51:26.651 --> 51:27.583
Spencer.

51:29.020 --> 51:31.420
(speaking in foreign language)

51:31.422 --> 51:33.789
- All right, that's enough.

51:33.791 --> 51:34.924
Bed time, lights out.

51:35.993 --> 51:37.460
Spencer, go to your room.

51:37.462 --> 51:38.961
- But I wanna sleep in here.

51:38.963 --> 51:40.596
- Yeah, no, it's okay.

51:40.598 --> 51:42.531
- No more games, both of you.

51:44.268 --> 51:47.002
(intense music)

51:55.847 --> 51:57.980
(pill rattling)

51:57.982 --> 52:00.683
(water flowing)

52:22.440 --> 52:25.174
(water flowing)

52:45.196 --> 52:48.164
(Marcus screaming)

52:49.667 --> 52:52.301
(creepy music)

52:59.243 --> 53:01.010
No, no, no, it's fine Michael.

53:01.012 --> 53:03.646
They're, um, no trouble at all.

53:04.916 --> 53:05.814
I'm serious.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.919
No, they're great.

53:13.791 --> 53:14.657
We're having fun.

53:14.658 --> 53:15.524
Micheal, take as much
     time as you need.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.326
The important thing
     is that the two of you

53:17.328 --> 53:18.360
work things out.

53:20.198 --> 53:21.931
As much time as you need.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.232
Really.

53:23.234 --> 53:26.135
All is good here.
     (car engine whirring)

53:26.137 --> 53:28.337
Ah, I gotta go.

53:28.339 --> 53:29.805
There's a delivery
     man at the front door.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.207
I'll give you a call later.

53:34.579 --> 53:35.744
(sighing)

53:35.746 --> 53:37.813
(car door banging)

53:37.815 --> 53:38.881
- Wait, I wanna see.

53:42.687 --> 53:44.453
Oh, my god.

53:44.455 --> 53:45.254
Really?

53:45.256 --> 53:46.522
- Yeah, cool.

53:48.526 --> 53:49.442
Thanks Uncle M.

53:49.443 --> 53:50.359
- I know my company
      can grow tiresome.

53:51.462 --> 53:53.128
- You're such a
       pushover, Uncle M.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.767
- Careful now, there's
     two of 'em in there.

54:00.404 --> 54:01.804
Where is he?

54:01.806 --> 54:02.972
- [Spencer] Right there.

54:02.974 --> 54:04.974
- At the top.
      - Don't let him out.

54:26.297 --> 54:27.063
- Here you are.

54:27.064 --> 54:27.830
With a little cherry
      juice mixed in.

54:27.832 --> 54:28.897
Just the way you like it.

54:28.899 --> 54:30.899
- It's a little early, isn't it?

54:34.572 --> 54:37.473
- You know if we have to
  run into town for anything,

54:37.475 --> 54:39.141
I could drive.

54:39.143 --> 54:40.042
- Hmm.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.314
Is Spencer all right?

54:46.851 --> 54:50.452
- Sure, you mean in general?

54:50.454 --> 54:51.920
- The talking to himself.

54:54.392 --> 54:55.658
- It's just a phase.

54:57.028 --> 54:58.494
Remember, I used to do that.

55:00.765 --> 55:01.730
It's nothing.

55:02.867 --> 55:05.467
It's just little kids
     playing make-believe.

55:07.972 --> 55:09.004
- I remember.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.572
We couldn't get you to stop.

55:13.444 --> 55:14.343
- Kids.

55:22.386 --> 55:25.454
(atmospheric music)

55:30.428 --> 55:32.561
- Aren't you going to
     watch this with me?

55:36.634 --> 55:38.367
Who are you texting?

55:39.537 --> 55:40.436
- No one.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.813
(crickets chirping)

55:50.815 --> 55:53.549
(ominous music)

56:09.767 --> 56:12.501
(intense music)

56:16.807 --> 56:19.875
(creature snarling)

56:25.349 --> 56:29.685
(Lily singing in
       foreign language)

57:05.923 --> 57:07.356
- Do you love me?

57:12.897 --> 57:15.631
- What kind of question is that?

57:20.571 --> 57:21.970
- You're a liar.

57:24.375 --> 57:26.775
(Marcus sighing)

57:26.777 --> 57:28.410
- Lily.
         - If you're so

57:28.412 --> 57:31.213
in love with me,
       then why don't you

57:31.215 --> 57:33.081
do something about it?
   - Okay, shh, you just need

57:33.083 --> 57:34.349
to keep your voice down.

57:35.219 --> 57:37.019
- Why don't you touch me?

57:37.021 --> 57:38.520
- You need to get off me.

57:38.522 --> 57:39.421
Get off.

57:40.925 --> 57:42.691
- What's wrong with me?

57:42.693 --> 57:44.226
- Lily, you're drunk.

57:48.999 --> 57:49.898
- I am not.

57:52.736 --> 57:53.635
- It's late.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.239
You're not yourself.

57:57.241 --> 57:59.675
- I'm not a fucking
      child, all right?

58:10.721 --> 58:12.521
We used to be best friends.

58:13.491 --> 58:16.091
You and me.

58:16.093 --> 58:16.992
Remember?

58:19.296 --> 58:20.162
Remember?

58:22.132 --> 58:23.765
- Yeah, I remember.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.674
- You used to bring
      me little gifts.

58:35.446 --> 58:38.680
You taught me poems and songs.

58:41.619 --> 58:42.951
You liked me.

58:46.624 --> 58:48.457
Why don't you like me anymore?

58:57.768 --> 58:58.667
- I adore you.

59:02.406 --> 59:03.839
- Then why don't you show it?

59:07.111 --> 59:09.711
- Something, something
     is not right with me.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.613
I'm, I'm very sick.

59:13.117 --> 59:14.316
Can you even see that?

59:15.252 --> 59:16.151
Hmm?

59:20.190 --> 59:22.658
- Well, there's no
    help for what you have.

59:32.069 --> 59:32.968
- You know?

59:35.906 --> 59:37.539
- Oh, I know, Uncle M.

59:44.014 --> 59:46.381
Do you know what's inside you?

59:48.919 --> 59:49.785
- Tell me.

59:52.089 --> 59:53.221
- A monster.

59:55.659 --> 59:57.960
A very hungry monster.

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:04.900
That wants to eat little girls.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.068
- Stop, get it out of me

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.869
because I can't take it anymore.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.810
- There is one way
       out. (chuckling)

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.679
- Goddammit, Lily, stop it.

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:21.750
- (moaning) Just one way out.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:23.885
And it's in here.

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:28.156
(laughing)

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:15.270
(ominous music)

01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:19.574
(clanking)

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:29.985
(Marcus gasping)

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:49.037
(waves crashing)

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:52.407
(clattering)

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:55.177
- [Paul] You're
    looking rundown Marcus.

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:57.112
- [Marcus] I apologize, I just,

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:58.747
I haven't been feeling myself.

01:01:58.749 --> 01:01:59.715
- [Paul] I don't see any trouble

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:01.316
if the kids come to our place.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:02.684
- Oh, no, no, no,
      no, we're all good.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:04.720
Michael and Grace are
     gonna be home tomorrow

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:06.288
or the next day.

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.158
- Lily.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.426
- She has a rough night.

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:14.629
- Are you sure?

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.431
We're here to help.

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:17.799
- They're happy here Paul.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.236
This is their home too.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.306
(atmospheric music)

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:40.255
- Spencer.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:44.493
I thought I should bring you

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:46.461
a little bit of
     something to munch on.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:02.310
Is that a praying mantis?

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.112
- [Spencer] Yeah.

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.656
- [Paul] Oh, dear.

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:16.725
What are they doing now?

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:22.330
- She's eating him.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:24.699
Just what they do sometimes.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:30.338
- Well that's not very nice.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:36.144
Lily?

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.850
Where are you going?

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:47.489
(mantis flickering)

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:52.227
Is everything okay here?

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:54.362
- Yeah, I guess.

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:55.597
Our parents are in the city,

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:58.633
but they should be back soon.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.802
- What about your sister?

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.109
(power circuit thudding)

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:10.645
(Paul sighing)

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.981
(atmospheric music)

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:14.382
- I'm sure it's
       just the breaker.

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:15.684
This old house!

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.553
I'll be right back.

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:32.500
Jesus.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.777
(ominous music)

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:45.046
What the?

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.457
Marcus, what the hell?

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:04.933
What?

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.372
(lever clanking)

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:16.211
That looks okay.

01:05:16.213 --> 01:05:17.479
(door clacking)

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.513
(breaker whirring)

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:21.483
(circuit clicking)

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:28.256
Jesus.

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:35.230
(intense music)

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:36.298
What's this?

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:39.601
(electricity zapping)

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.637
(Paul screaming)

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.807
- There's something
      in the house.

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:49.210
- Yes, there is.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.179
- What is it?

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:55.817
(atmospheric music)

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:57.819
- I don't know exactly.

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:01.256
- What does it want?

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.563
- For us to be together.

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.637
I can fell the pull too.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:20.842
It's always been there.
    - No, quit playing.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.178
- It's not a game.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:32.654
- Something's happening Lily.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.955
It's just not okay.

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:35.890
- Yes it is.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:38.460
It is okay.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:45.367
It's the only way.

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:51.172
- It would do no good.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.812
- It was meant to be.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:06:59.481
- Stop it.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:05.520
- We're meant to be together.
 - No.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:09.090
This is all in your head. It's
 just a childish game, okay?

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:11.026
- No.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:14.963
It's in your head,

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:16.297
under the bed,

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:17.265
inside.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.501
It must come out.

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:22.837
You wanna be free of it.

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.373
Just listen to me.

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:36.785
Uncle M., fairytales aren't
  just for little girls.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:41.389
- No.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:45.260
It's nonsense,
       it's make-believe.

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:47.562
I understand now, I see it.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.374
(intense music)

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.919
- Mr. Keversmith?

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:12.587
Are you down there?

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.055
(siren blaring)

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:49.189
(chattering on radio)

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:50.625
(somber music)

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:54.095
(Mrs. Keversmith crying)

01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:01.402
(speaking faintly)

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.747
- We're fine, really.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:47.015
They're having a ball.

01:09:47.017 --> 01:09:49.050
We had a picnic down by
    the water the other day.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:51.618
Um, Michael, there's
    nothing to worry about.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:53.988
Well don't be.

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.889
They're fine.

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:57.292
Everything's fine.

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:00.862
I hope things are
      working out for you.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.398
Um, how's Grace?

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.869
Oh, oh, good, good, good,
   good, that's good Michael.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.939
Um, take as long as you need.

01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:11.940
I mean it.

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:22.250
(ominous music)

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:33.094
(metallic clacking)

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:44.772
(wires clattering)

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:53.381
(breaker clanking)

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:56.017
(electricity buzzing)

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:57.318
Hello?

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.021
(ominous music)

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:04.058
(crickets chirping)

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:25.913
Why are you here?

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:27.582
(candle snuffer scraping)

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:29.350
I don't need you.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:30.885
(candle snuffer clinking)

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.621
I thought I made
       myself very clear.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:37.692
It's just this place,
     I shouldn't have come.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:41.129
I'm losing my mind here.

01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:42.930
- You lost more than that.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:43.931
Keversmith?

01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:46.768
- The caretaker?

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.536
That was an accident.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:50.872
- You don't think they'll
   be an investigation?

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:52.640
- I don't know.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:56.444
- What will they find?

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.846
Roses under your pillow?

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.348
(radio static)
         (creepy music)

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:03.217
Panties hidden in
       the cookie jar?

01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:04.118
- It's not like that.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.320
- Really?

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:06.688
She's very attractive.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.955
I wouldn't begrudge you.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.157
- Why are you here?

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:12.994
- Maybe a little birdie
    whispered in my ear.

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:17.565
I have a sixth sense about
   these kinds of situations.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:20.268
Oh, thinking of taking
     the easy way out?

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.504
- I'm not well, obviously.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.642
(pills rattling)

01:12:29.546 --> 01:12:31.746
(floor creaking)

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:34.982
(gun hammer clicking)

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.921
(footsteps tapping)

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:45.827
(ominous music)

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.242
(creature snarling)

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.657
It's so beautiful up here.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.060
The air is so crisp.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.431
It's so peaceful.

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:25.066
(radio static)
         (creepy music)

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:26.801
You don't know
       how lucky you are.

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.773
- Just leave, please.

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:35.777
(pills rattling)
        (Marcus gasping)

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:38.413
(Marcus coughing and gagging)

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.748
- If I leave you're
   never gonna see me again.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:44.852
Doesn't that make you unhappy?

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.496
(crickets chirping)

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:58.065
(eerie music)

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.900
(gun hammer clicking)

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.706
- I'm not in any
       trouble with you.

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.808
- No, you won't be.

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:43.778
- What do you want?

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.014
- Nothing.

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:50.418
That's what makes me
      different from you.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:52.820
- I'll pay you.

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:55.890
You name an amount,

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:57.992
and you just, you walk away.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:01.062
- You're a filthy slug.

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:02.330
- Oh, my God.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:03.965
- God's got nothing to
     do with it, my friend.

01:15:03.967 --> 01:15:05.533
We'e all just animals.

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:06.634
(creature snarling)
      Fighting one other

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:07.835
for scraps.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.403
Desperate to escape.

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:11.706
(creature roaring)
       (Evan screaming)

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:14.075
(gun firing)

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.443
(Marcus yelping)

01:15:15.445 --> 01:15:17.845
(dramatic music)

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:18.679
- Lily?

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.482
(Marcus gasping)

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:25.186
- [Lily] Uncle M.,
      what are you doing?

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.355
- Lily, I need your help.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.858
Where is it?

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.460
Where'd it go?

01:15:32.462 --> 01:15:33.861
- Spencer, can you help me?

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:36.130
(intense music)

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.365
It'll be okay.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:46.774
(Marcus groaning)

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:53.981
Remember, I couldn't find you,

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:55.449
but then you found me.

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:58.519
(atmospheric music)

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:03.991
(water bubbling)

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:05.426
(crickets chirping)

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:06.561
(water dripping)

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:10.131
(water running)
        (doors creaking)

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:11.933
(bugs chirping)

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:13.668
(wire snapping)

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:14.869
(crickets chirping)
      (water sloshing)

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:16.671
(birds chirping)
        (bugs chirping)

01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:19.273
(shell clinking)

01:16:19.275 --> 01:16:20.508
(seagull squawking)

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:22.476
(mirror squeaking)
       (water sloshing)

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:25.212
(water running)

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.998
(atmospheric music)

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:54.008
(phone ringing)

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.869
(ominous music)

01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:07.682
(atmospheric music)

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.399
(speaking in foreign language)

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.167
- Hmm?
         - I'm scared.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:06.273
What if something happens to us?

01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:08.943
- We'll be all right Spencer.

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.013
- Promise to me.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.718
- Yeah, it's gonna be okay.

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:25.593
(atmospheric music)

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.135
(lock clacking)

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:40.608
(electricity zapping)

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:04.165
(fire crackling)
 (singing in foreign language)

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:19.313
(radio static)

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:32.226
- The house is wired.

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:35.262
You see,

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:38.866
no one gets in,

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:42.036
and no one gets out.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.007
Tame the monster.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:58.619
(sighing)

01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:01.822
(car engine whirring)

01:21:03.793 --> 01:21:05.326
- Lily, Mom and Dad are here.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:10.164
- [Marcus] Spencer, no!

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:12.566
(electricity zapping)

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:13.534
(body thudding on floor)

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:15.903
- (gasping) Spencer!

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:17.872
- Spencer?
           - Spencer!

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:18.873
Jesus.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.542
(somber music)

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:26.313
(Marcus panting)

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.217
(Grace crying)

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:32.519
Lily, Lily!

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:35.890
Oh, my God.

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:38.359
- You knew I'd come back!

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:41.428
How long have you been waiting?

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:45.199
How long have you
      been waiting for me?

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.434
(panting)

01:21:49.005 --> 01:21:52.806
- Remember, I was looking
   for you everywhere.

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.578
I was so excited to share
   this important thing.

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:01.815
(Marcus gasping)

01:22:02.985 --> 01:22:05.753
(dramatic music)

01:22:13.996 --> 01:22:17.131
(seagulls squawking)

01:22:23.406 --> 01:22:24.305
Marcus, wait.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:30.110
(water sloshing)

01:22:46.896 --> 01:22:48.362
Please come back.

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:50.998
Please.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:54.301
- You were right Lily.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.274
It's meant to be.

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:07.514
- Just come back to me.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.217
- No.

01:23:12.021 --> 01:23:14.488
You need to go home now Lily.

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:19.626
I understand now, I'm a monster.

01:23:23.032 --> 01:23:25.299
It needs a place
       to hide, to grow.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.038
- You're not a monster.

01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:34.041
I love you.

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:47.154
- We were meant to be together

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.130
in another life.

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.302
- Marcus, no!

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:03.137
Marcus!

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:09.510
(body thudding)

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:10.778
No, Marcus!

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.580
(dramatic music)

01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:24.892
(Lily crying)

01:24:42.111 --> 01:24:43.010
Marcus.

01:24:54.657 --> 01:24:56.824
(crying)

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:36.597
(water bubbling)

01:25:36.599 --> 01:25:39.666
(atmospheric music)

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:57.284
(water bubbling)

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:20.941
(creature slithering)

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:28.715
(ominous music)

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:36.523
¶ I heard a story ¶

01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:41.995
¶ About this girl ¶

01:26:44.233 --> 01:26:49.303
¶ She was lost in ¶

01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:54.608
¶ Her own little world ¶

01:26:56.712 --> 01:27:01.782
¶ And every morning ¶

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:07.120
¶ She walks to the sea ¶

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:14.361
¶ And waits for sunset ¶

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:19.399
¶ Just to keep her mind free ¶

01:27:21.804 --> 01:27:26.873
¶ From all the voices ¶

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:33.280
¶ That makes the noises ¶

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:37.251
¶ In her head ¶

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:45.058
¶ They drove her mad ¶

01:27:47.196 --> 01:27:52.266
¶ If there were choices ¶

01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:58.538
¶ To live or end this ¶

01:27:59.742 --> 01:28:04.745
¶ She'll end this now ¶

01:28:05.447 --> 01:28:08.181
¶ Without a doubt ¶

01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:07.941
¶ With all the voices ¶

01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:14.247
¶ That makes her voiceless ¶

01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:20.954
¶ In her head ¶

01:29:21.657 --> 01:29:24.157
¶ They drove her mad ¶

01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:35.535
(melodic guitar)
