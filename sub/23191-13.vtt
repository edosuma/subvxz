(piano music)

00:54.717 --> 00:56.751
(women coughing and moaning)

01:09.164 --> 01:12.333
Ow! Dammit.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.435
(A woman screams.)

01:14.469 --> 01:17.305
(nurse crying)

01:17.339 --> 01:18.973
What is it?

01:19.007 --> 01:21.842
Ward C.

01:21.876 --> 01:24.311
Nurse Collins. I...

01:24.345 --> 01:26.346
(nurse crying)

01:26.380 --> 01:28.449
(dramatic music)

01:31.619 --> 01:33.954
- What's happening?
- They got out.

01:33.988 --> 01:35.856
- Who?
- The incurables.

01:53.341 --> 01:55.575
- (woman growling)
- (Julia gasps.)

02:09.844 --> 02:11.811
I'm coming in with you.

02:11.845 --> 02:14.547
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

02:18.819 --> 02:21.621
(woman): It's OK, baby. It's OK.

02:21.655 --> 02:23.623
- Yeah. Mommy...
- Rose,

02:23.657 --> 02:26.225
- get away from her.
- No.

02:26.259 --> 02:30.062
I need you to move away from
her. I need to help the nurse.

02:30.096 --> 02:32.331
I doubt you need that.

02:32.365 --> 02:34.699
She's dead, dear. Long dead.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.902
Then I really need you to step away,

02:36.937 --> 02:39.805
- Rose.
- Well, are you gonna do it?

02:39.839 --> 02:42.341
You said you were gonna tear her to pieces!

02:42.375 --> 02:45.209
There she is. (Woman laughing)

02:45.244 --> 02:47.412
- Ah!
- Haha!

02:47.447 --> 02:49.314
Get off of me!

02:49.348 --> 02:51.483
No, no, no!

02:51.517 --> 02:53.351
Ah...

02:53.385 --> 02:55.186
Lock her in her room.

02:58.023 --> 03:01.725
- Mr. Drainie! Mr. Drainie!
- Oh! Oh!

03:01.760 --> 03:04.929
- Are you alright?
- Ah! Ah! What happened?

03:04.964 --> 03:07.966
I was hit from behind.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.168
Where's Nurse Collins?

03:10.202 --> 03:13.104
She's dead, Mr. Drainie.

03:13.138 --> 03:15.206
Jean's dead.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.342
One of those monsters killed her.

03:18.576 --> 03:21.679
- And she did it with my knife!
- Don't touch that!

03:21.713 --> 03:25.649
I need you to escort
them all into their rooms.

03:25.684 --> 03:28.352
Why, thank you very much.

03:28.386 --> 03:30.354
It's so rare to have

03:30.388 --> 03:32.690
such gentlemanly behaviour these days.

03:32.724 --> 03:35.792
Will you be leaving soon?
My babies need their sleep.

03:35.826 --> 03:38.862
- They need the lights out.
- Hannah, can I come help?

03:38.896 --> 03:40.763
Of course, Girly.

03:40.798 --> 03:43.100
(Girly laughing)

03:43.134 --> 03:45.302
Of course.

03:45.336 --> 03:47.904
Thank you, Dr. Ogden.

03:47.938 --> 03:49.806
- (Girly laughing)
- OK, baby. We're OK.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.909
Shh, shh. Shh, shh...

03:52.943 --> 03:54.477
Miss Pearce.

03:54.512 --> 03:57.580
(door closing)

03:57.615 --> 04:00.884
Well, that was certainly more
exciting than most evenings in here.

04:00.918 --> 04:04.621
- Did you see anything?
- Of course not.

04:04.655 --> 04:08.324
And if I did...

04:10.260 --> 04:14.263
(thunderclaps)

04:30.780 --> 04:33.782
Can you have your staff
transfer her to Dr. Grace?

04:33.816 --> 04:37.686
Of course.

04:39.455 --> 04:42.323
How did they all get out of their rooms?

04:42.358 --> 04:44.625
I don't know.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.262
The guard on duty's name is Samuel Drainie.

04:47.296 --> 04:49.964
If the patients have
behaved themselves, they are

04:49.998 --> 04:53.101
allowed a half-hour free
time in the recreation room.

04:53.135 --> 04:55.370
After that, they are
locked up for the evening.

04:55.404 --> 04:57.404
And you locked in Rose Maxwell?

04:57.439 --> 05:01.141
I didn't have to. She has not been
allowed out of her room all day.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.143
She'd been just unusually agitated.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.112
- Unusually?
- (Door closing)

05:05.146 --> 05:06.814
(thunder growling)

05:06.848 --> 05:09.183
No more than usual, actually.

05:09.217 --> 05:13.687
Why take a knife into that ward?

05:13.721 --> 05:16.390
I've been attacked 4 times. Who wouldn't?

05:16.424 --> 05:20.660
I see. So, after locking
in the remaining patients,

05:20.695 --> 05:23.330
you checked to be sure Miss
Maxwell's room was secure?

05:23.364 --> 05:25.966
I've been doing this job for 15 years.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.336
There are very few duties to forget.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.371
All of the rooms are
locked with one common key?

05:32.406 --> 05:36.509
That's right, yes. And
the ward door as well.

05:38.345 --> 05:41.648
Well then, Mr. Drainie,
how did they all get out?

05:41.682 --> 05:43.382
I don't know.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.384
I heard a commotion, I went to respond.

05:45.419 --> 05:47.386
Nurse Collins was being attacked!

05:47.421 --> 05:49.388
And they were all out of their rooms?

05:49.423 --> 05:52.492
- I... I think so.
- You think so?

05:52.526 --> 05:56.362
A nurse was being attacked.
I didn't do a head count!

05:56.396 --> 05:58.931
(thunder growling)

05:58.965 --> 06:00.866
Oh, Mr. Drainie.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.935
Your lantern.

06:02.969 --> 06:06.438
Oh! Thank you.

06:08.374 --> 06:10.375
Hmm.

06:10.409 --> 06:12.477
It's possible he may have forgotten

06:12.512 --> 06:14.479
to lock one of the doors, but all of them?

06:14.514 --> 06:16.548
It's not likely.

06:16.582 --> 06:18.583
One of the patients could
have got hold of a key.

06:18.618 --> 06:22.254
Perhaps Rose Maxwell, the
one who killed Nurse Collins.

06:22.288 --> 06:25.323
- I'd like a word with her.
- So would I.

06:26.859 --> 06:29.394
Miss Maxwell has a serious
psychiatric condition.

06:29.428 --> 06:31.530
She's not responsible for her actions.

06:31.564 --> 06:35.033
Be that as it may, Julia. It
makes her no less dangerous.

06:38.904 --> 06:42.273
Rose, may we speak with you for a moment?

06:42.307 --> 06:45.543
Miss Maxwell, we need to
ask you some questions.

06:45.577 --> 06:47.745
How did you get out of your room?

06:47.780 --> 06:49.747
The door was open.

06:49.782 --> 06:53.003
- You're saying that you...
- Is that Detective Murdoch I hear?

06:54.117 --> 06:55.752
I want to speak with you.

06:55.787 --> 06:58.055
Only you.

07:10.534 --> 07:12.502
You finally come for a visit.

07:12.536 --> 07:14.537
You're not my patient, Rose.

07:14.572 --> 07:17.007
You remember the island, don't you, Julia?

07:17.041 --> 07:20.077
We had a gay time there.

07:20.111 --> 07:22.645
We're not here to talk about that.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.647
I wish I had killed you all.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.982
All of you congratulating that witch

07:27.017 --> 07:29.051
for taking my Cedric away.

07:31.388 --> 07:33.089
William.

07:33.423 --> 07:35.358
Miss Pearce.

07:35.392 --> 07:37.827
You're looking so well.

07:37.861 --> 07:39.762
How's married life?

07:39.796 --> 07:41.698
Has it settled into a dull routine yet?

07:41.732 --> 07:45.267
I find that is usually the
case, especially for the man.

07:45.301 --> 07:47.236
Thank you, Miss Pearce.

07:47.270 --> 07:49.839
I shouldn't be locked
up with these lunatics.

07:49.873 --> 07:51.540
William,

07:51.574 --> 07:55.044
I was just so distraught
when my fiancé jilted me.

07:55.078 --> 07:58.714
I didn't know what I was
doing. I just lost my mind.

07:58.748 --> 08:01.383
If I could go back in time...

08:01.417 --> 08:03.151
Miss Pearce,

08:03.185 --> 08:05.887
I know that you are as sane as I am.

08:05.921 --> 08:08.957
No need to try to convince me otherwise.

08:08.991 --> 08:11.560
It is amazing what a good
lawyer can do for you, isn't it?

08:11.594 --> 08:15.429
Miss Pearce, I only need
to hear one thing from you.

08:15.464 --> 08:17.698
Did you or did you not see

08:17.733 --> 08:20.235
Rose Maxwell kill Nurse Collins?

08:20.269 --> 08:22.737
What would you like me to say?

08:22.772 --> 08:27.008
I can say anything you want.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.043
Good night, Miss Pearce.

08:31.046 --> 08:34.815
When I get out, I expect
you will be calling on me.

08:34.849 --> 08:36.817
Detective.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.052
Why did you kill Nurse Collins?

08:39.087 --> 08:41.188
I had the chance.

08:41.222 --> 08:44.057
- That's it?
- That was enough.

08:44.092 --> 08:47.928
- So, you admit to killing her?
- Of course.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.563
Julia, I liked that feeling.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.299
(Julia sighs.)

08:52.333 --> 08:54.434
- I had almost forgotten it.
- That's enough, Rose.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.904
And please...

08:56.938 --> 08:59.539
give my regards to Emily Grace.

09:02.343 --> 09:04.511
We're done here.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.046
Please lock the door.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.715
(Rose roaring)

09:08.749 --> 09:11.951
(Julia grunting)

09:11.985 --> 09:15.722
- (Murdoch): Get off of her!
- (Rose): YAA! You're next!

09:15.756 --> 09:17.924
- See that she's restrained.
- Yes, sir.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.826
(Rose): Ah!

09:19.860 --> 09:22.628
- Julia.
- (Rose): No!

09:22.662 --> 09:24.763
- (Julia gasping)
- Are you alright?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.966
- (laughing): Yes.
- Your arm?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.935
- (Rose): No! Enough!
- It's fine.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.737
(thunder growling)

09:31.771 --> 09:34.207
She was stabbed 11 times.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.609
No one could have survived the attack.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.813
- Rose is an extremely violent woman.
- I am all too aware of that.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.281
You know she still takes no responsibility

09:43.316 --> 09:45.283
for any of her actions on the island

09:45.318 --> 09:48.554
- or before?
- She murdered her family.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.824
She murdered her friends.
Who would want to face that?

09:51.858 --> 09:54.259
Now, she vows revenge on both of us.

09:54.293 --> 09:58.363
- Revenge for what?
- For surviving, I suppose.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.101
Do you... do you think,

10:03.135 --> 10:05.837
maybe, she should be transferred
to another institution?

10:05.872 --> 10:08.206
One further away from us?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.842
Emily, that's not necessary.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.244
An ax-wielding maniac
vows revenge on you...

10:13.278 --> 10:15.546
and me for that matter... and
you don't think it necessary?

10:15.581 --> 10:17.415
She's in custody.

10:17.449 --> 10:19.384
♪

10:19.418 --> 10:22.086
Alright. It's just a caution.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.888
Of course.

10:25.824 --> 10:28.625
Julia...

10:28.659 --> 10:31.028
there were bite marks on the body.

10:39.037 --> 10:42.072
(unsettling music)

10:59.690 --> 11:03.192
Rose?

11:03.227 --> 11:06.329
I need to speak with you.

11:06.363 --> 11:09.565
Rose!

11:09.599 --> 11:10.566
(screaming)

11:10.600 --> 11:12.568
Julia...

11:12.602 --> 11:14.337
(gasping)

11:14.371 --> 11:17.372
(thunder growling)

11:17.407 --> 11:20.142
Julia, is everything alright?

11:20.176 --> 11:22.044
It's nothing, William.

11:22.078 --> 11:24.413
Just an unpleasant dream.

11:24.448 --> 11:26.916
- Go back to sleep.
- Are you sure?

11:43.081 --> 11:45.181
<i>It was reported that all of the inmates</i>

11:45.215 --> 11:48.317
were out of their rooms when
Mr. Drainie entered the Ward.

11:48.352 --> 11:50.319
All except Eva Pearce.

11:50.354 --> 11:52.988
Apparently she remained in
her room during the commotion.

11:53.023 --> 11:54.823
And they just wander around free?

11:54.858 --> 11:56.825
Well, no, sir, not usually.

11:56.860 --> 11:59.728
You said the old bugger was forgetful.

11:59.763 --> 12:01.764
Yes, but I'm not inclined to believe

12:01.798 --> 12:05.367
- he forgot to lock every room.
- And no one saw anything?

12:05.401 --> 12:07.369
Well, there's no one
usually down there, sir.

12:07.403 --> 12:10.039
Mr. Drainie stops in once
an evening but that's it.

12:10.073 --> 12:13.042
Whose fingermarks are on the knife?

12:13.076 --> 12:15.578
George is working on that as we speak.

12:18.548 --> 12:20.949
Hey, look.

12:20.983 --> 12:23.085
- Constable.
- (Rose): Go away!

12:23.119 --> 12:25.320
Don't you have mine on file?

12:25.354 --> 12:27.322
Miss Pearce.

12:27.356 --> 12:29.458
Or did you just want to
get close to me again?

12:32.361 --> 12:34.662
You're very gentle.

12:34.697 --> 12:37.665
- (door closing)
- (woman): Come and see her.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.667
That's all, Miss Pearce.

12:39.702 --> 12:41.936
Hello, Constable Crabtree.

12:41.971 --> 12:44.906
- Mrs. Lynd.
- I do apologize

12:44.940 --> 12:47.541
for trying to kill you
the last time I saw you.

12:47.576 --> 12:51.078
- I misjudged you.
- Mrs. Lynd, we all make mistakes.

12:51.113 --> 12:53.447
I trust you're staying on
the right side of the road?

12:53.482 --> 12:54.881
- I am indeed.
- Good boy.

12:54.916 --> 12:57.251
- Good to see you, Mrs. Lynd.
- You too.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.620
- Oh well...
- Hush, I'm sure the constable

12:59.654 --> 13:01.655
will only be a minute.

13:01.689 --> 13:04.858
Constable, can you take Suzanne's as well?

13:04.892 --> 13:06.860
She would love you to.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.329
Uh...

13:09.363 --> 13:13.100
Yes, of course.

13:13.134 --> 13:14.901
(Brackenreid): What the devil is this?

13:14.936 --> 13:16.402
(phone ringing)

13:16.437 --> 13:19.339
Hard to say no to a child, sir.

13:19.373 --> 13:22.509
So all of their fingermarks
were on the murder weapon?

13:22.543 --> 13:24.710
Yes. All but Eva Pearce.

13:27.414 --> 13:29.482
We can't ignore the possibility

13:29.517 --> 13:31.684
that one of the other women
in the ward is the killer.

13:31.718 --> 13:34.220
What about Rose Maxwell's admissions?

13:34.255 --> 13:36.289
She's a deluded woman, Julia.

13:36.323 --> 13:39.626
- I have a duty to make inquiries.
- We have a duty.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.828
- William?
- She tried to kill you, Julia.

13:42.863 --> 13:46.032
- I'm not entirely comfortable...
- And I'm not a schoolgirl.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.269
(Murdoch sighs.)

13:50.303 --> 13:52.138
Miss Maxwell, you've been telling people

13:52.172 --> 13:55.240
that you killed Nurse Collins. Why?

13:55.275 --> 13:57.242
Because I did.

13:57.277 --> 13:59.978
Is it possible you might
be stretching the truth?

14:00.012 --> 14:03.215
No. I attacked her.

14:03.249 --> 14:05.984
- Did she struggle?
- She didn't have a chance.

14:07.987 --> 14:10.322
She was a tough old bird.

14:10.356 --> 14:13.491
I bit her and she didn't even squawk.

14:13.525 --> 14:15.493
And you're sure she was still alive?

14:15.527 --> 14:18.329
I certainly am.

14:22.068 --> 14:25.136
I must say I was glad to
see Nurse Collins dead.

14:25.171 --> 14:27.672
- Why?
- She was a cruel,

14:27.707 --> 14:30.341
spiteful woman.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.210
She would take my babies away from me.

14:32.244 --> 14:35.145
With the slightest provocation,
she'd just take them away.

14:35.180 --> 14:37.781
I love my babies.

14:37.816 --> 14:39.783
You picked up the knife? Why?

14:39.818 --> 14:42.420
Seemed a handy thing to have.

14:44.256 --> 14:46.223
I don't like to speak ill of the dead,

14:46.257 --> 14:48.491
but she got what she deserved.

14:48.526 --> 14:50.660
She was wicked,

14:50.695 --> 14:52.662
and the wicked are to be punished.

14:52.697 --> 14:55.465
His will was done.

14:55.499 --> 14:58.468
The murder of an innocent
woman was God's will?

14:58.502 --> 15:00.838
Oh-oh-oh, she was far from innocent.

15:00.872 --> 15:03.707
What did Nurse Collins do
that deserved to be punished?

15:06.944 --> 15:09.446
I can't say.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.349
- Mrs. Lynd...
- No. I won't say.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.401
You'll have to ask Charlotte.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.536
She was her favourite.

15:16.570 --> 15:19.205
(Julia): Did you see anything?

15:19.239 --> 15:21.740
I didn't. I was suffering

15:21.775 --> 15:24.110
from a migraine and they
can be terribly blinding.

15:24.144 --> 15:27.780
Charlotte, if you saw
something, you need to tell us.

15:27.815 --> 15:30.983
- I didn't.
- Don't lie to me, Charlotte.

15:31.018 --> 15:32.618
I need to know the truth.

15:32.652 --> 15:34.287
What happened?

15:34.321 --> 15:38.290
LEAVE HER ALONE! She said
she didn't see anything!

15:38.325 --> 15:40.659
Detective, may I have a moment?

15:43.296 --> 15:45.964
- Maddie?
- Yes?

15:45.998 --> 15:49.501
Were you holding the knife?

15:49.536 --> 15:51.637
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Why?

15:51.671 --> 15:54.906
To keep Rose away from Girly.
She's not all there, you know.

15:54.941 --> 15:57.809
Maddie...

15:57.844 --> 15:59.777
can I talk to Girly?

16:01.714 --> 16:03.949
Please.

16:03.983 --> 16:07.785
Girly, it's me. Dr. Ogden.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.221
Can I talk to you for a moment?

16:13.859 --> 16:15.827
Hello, Dr. Ogden.

16:15.861 --> 16:18.363
Hello, Girly.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.237
Haha!

16:20.272 --> 16:22.072
How are you?

16:22.107 --> 16:24.074
Good!

16:24.109 --> 16:26.543
Girly...

16:26.577 --> 16:29.179
do you know what Nurse
Collins did to Charlotte?

16:32.517 --> 16:35.085
Will you tell me?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.554
- I'll get in trouble.
- No.

16:37.588 --> 16:40.257
No, Girly, you won't. I promise.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.230
Nurse would come into
Charlotte's room at night

16:47.264 --> 16:50.266
and she would touch her

16:50.301 --> 16:52.636
in places she wasn't supposed to.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.005
Thank you, Girly.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.142
(soft laughing)

17:01.478 --> 17:04.512
Do you believe her?

17:04.548 --> 17:06.648
She's 3 years old.

17:06.683 --> 17:08.784
I don't think she would lie.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.520
Did she say anything else?

17:11.555 --> 17:17.526
Only that the nurse would touch
Charlotte in private places.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.395
I've asked to see all of the
files relating to Nurse Collins

17:20.430 --> 17:22.832
to see if I can find any corroboration.

17:24.534 --> 17:28.403
None of the others reported any violations.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.239
Maybe she didn't do it
to any of the others.

17:31.274 --> 17:33.175
Let's find out.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.915
I would offer you tea, but as you can see,

17:40.950 --> 17:43.218
my accommodations are somewhat sparse.

17:43.252 --> 17:45.653
- We don't care for tea.
- And what will you do for me

17:45.688 --> 17:47.289
if I answer your questions?

17:47.323 --> 17:50.124
You should be grateful
you still have your life.

17:50.158 --> 17:52.494
I told you, Detective,

17:52.528 --> 17:55.262
I will say and do whatever you want.

17:55.297 --> 17:57.499
Did you ever see

17:57.533 --> 17:59.634
Nurse Collins acting improperly

17:59.668 --> 18:01.636
around any of the patients here?

18:01.670 --> 18:05.772
- What would you like me to say?
- Did she molest anyone?

18:05.807 --> 18:08.142
I keep to myself.

18:08.176 --> 18:11.145
But if you would like me
to speak ill of the dead...

18:11.179 --> 18:14.581
This is obviously a waste
of everyone's time, Doctor.

18:14.616 --> 18:17.418
Just give me a moment, Detective.

18:17.452 --> 18:18.819
Eva.

18:18.853 --> 18:21.855
Rose Maxwell is a vicious killer.

18:21.890 --> 18:24.157
I doubt she needs a
reason to do what she does.

18:24.191 --> 18:28.028
She talks about it all the time, you know.

18:28.062 --> 18:31.264
She thinks you are the reason
she and Cedric aren't together.

18:31.298 --> 18:35.602
You threw her in here
and destroyed her life.

18:35.637 --> 18:38.871
What did Nurse Collins do
to make Rose attack her?

18:38.906 --> 18:40.873
She's getting bolder, you know.

18:40.908 --> 18:42.875
She's waiting for you

18:42.910 --> 18:45.045
to let down your guard, and when you do...

18:45.079 --> 18:47.046
Miss Pearce, why are
you trying to scare me?

18:47.047 --> 18:48.582
What do you think that's going to achieve?

18:48.682 --> 18:51.084
I'm not trying to scare you.

18:51.118 --> 18:54.119
I'm just letting you know
what I'm looking forward to.

18:54.154 --> 18:56.989
Because I know the reason I'm in here.

18:57.024 --> 19:00.026
You're here because you're a
murderer trying to evade justice.

19:00.060 --> 19:03.029
No, I'm here because you're scared of me.

19:03.063 --> 19:05.831
Have you seen the way
your husband looks at me?

19:05.866 --> 19:07.967
I'm sure you have.

19:08.001 --> 19:09.969
You may think he loves you,

19:10.003 --> 19:12.671
but you know he desires me.

19:14.674 --> 19:17.742
Perhaps I did misjudge
you. You're clearly deluded.

19:17.777 --> 19:20.312
Oh, am I? Once I get out,

19:20.346 --> 19:22.814
I'll show you who's the deluded one.

19:22.848 --> 19:24.349
Eva, you're never getting out.

19:24.434 --> 19:26.268
Ever.

19:26.302 --> 19:28.503
You're exactly where you deserve to be!

19:37.980 --> 19:40.181
I must confess I lost my temper.

19:40.215 --> 19:42.651
- Perfectly understandable.
- She may know the truth.

19:42.685 --> 19:44.652
She'll never surrender it.

19:44.686 --> 19:47.355
Doctor, why don't they let me see Rose?

19:47.389 --> 19:49.323
I was told you are not allowing
her to receive visitors?

19:49.358 --> 19:51.325
- That's true.
- Why?

19:51.360 --> 19:54.562
Because she killed someone, Mr. Maxwell.

19:54.596 --> 19:57.097
- Only yesterday.
- Who the devil are you?!

19:57.132 --> 20:00.934
Detective William Murdoch.
Toronto Constabulary.

20:00.969 --> 20:04.171
My sister would not kill
anyone without reason.

20:04.205 --> 20:07.041
Mr. Maxwell, I know from
first-hand experience what

20:07.075 --> 20:10.310
your sister can do. I was there
when she killed your fiancée.

20:10.344 --> 20:12.946
What was the reason there?

20:12.981 --> 20:16.516
Rose felt my marriage to
Lavinda would rend us asunder.

20:16.551 --> 20:18.785
She didn't want that.

20:18.819 --> 20:21.321
And that's a reason to kill someone?

20:21.355 --> 20:23.323
Rose felt Lavinda

20:23.357 --> 20:25.492
was a threat to her happiness.
That is why she killed her.

20:25.526 --> 20:28.428
- You excuse her actions?
- I understand them.

20:28.462 --> 20:31.364
Now, if I may, I would
like to see her, please.

20:31.399 --> 20:33.265
I'm sorry, Mr. Maxwell,
but I cannot permit that.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.401
- But I need to see her.
- Mr. Maxwell...

20:37.037 --> 20:39.672
... go home.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.347
How often does he visit?

20:48.381 --> 20:50.316
I don't know, William.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.590
- He never missed a day.
- That's unusual.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.526
A very devoted brother.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.894
Is there an address on file?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.833
- (man): Not mine!
- (second man): Hurry up!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.935
(third man): You like it here?

21:12.438 --> 21:15.540
Now, sir, this is where
Cedric Maxwell's been staying

21:15.574 --> 21:18.143
since his sister's confinement.
Previous to this, he had

21:18.177 --> 21:20.145
- a lovely house in Rosedale.
- What happened to it?

21:20.179 --> 21:22.747
Apparently he's spending every
penny trying to help Rose.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.882
Without much success.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.556
(door creaking)

21:31.590 --> 21:35.059
Oh... From Rosedale to this.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.828
I suppose the lawyers were
more dear than he imagined, sir.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.864
They always are.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.471
Letters from Rose, sir.

21:47.505 --> 21:49.874
Are we sure they were brother and sister?

21:49.908 --> 21:53.443
- Yes, George. Why?
- "I cannot bear to be apart."

21:53.478 --> 21:55.512
"I ache for you.

21:55.546 --> 21:57.514
At night I burn."

21:57.548 --> 22:00.884
Sir, hardly writing from
a sister to a brother.

22:00.918 --> 22:03.186
"I burn."

22:07.925 --> 22:09.959
Train tickets, sir.

22:09.994 --> 22:12.428
Cedric was to depart
with somebody last night.

22:12.462 --> 22:15.165
The same night his sister escaped her room.

22:15.199 --> 22:18.768
On a trip Miss Maxwell
was unable to take...

22:18.803 --> 22:22.005
in spite of her brother's best efforts.

22:24.612 --> 22:27.760
We haven't found Cedrix
Maxwell yet. But... we will.

22:28.216 --> 22:31.084
- I'd like to see those letters.
- Of course.

22:31.119 --> 22:33.453
It would appear that he slipped his sister

22:33.488 --> 22:36.923
a key to her room. We also
found 2 unused train tickets.

22:36.957 --> 22:38.892
He intended to flee the city.

22:38.926 --> 22:41.861
- So it would seem.
- (Children laughing)

22:46.299 --> 22:48.467
- (children laughing)
- Whoever knows the direction

22:48.502 --> 22:51.270
one's life will take?

22:51.304 --> 22:53.573
(woman): Yes, inside.

22:53.607 --> 22:55.574
Go inside.

22:58.311 --> 23:00.279
(woman): Remember the grapes?

23:00.313 --> 23:02.781
(man): I did, I did.
They're in the kitchen!

23:06.853 --> 23:08.754
Mr. Maxwell?

23:08.788 --> 23:11.457
♪

23:23.502 --> 23:25.470
Oh! Oh! Oh! (Cloth tearing)

23:25.504 --> 23:27.906
Oh! Ugh!

23:27.941 --> 23:29.740
Ah!

23:32.344 --> 23:34.679
Mr. Maxwell, we need to have a word.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.618
You have a filthy mind.

23:40.652 --> 23:44.055
The content of the
letters seems clear enough.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.725
Rose is my adopted sister.
We loved one another.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.994
And yet you attempted to marry another.

23:50.028 --> 23:53.097
I attempted to live in a way...

23:53.131 --> 23:55.600
that society deemed I should.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.002
It was a mistake.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.971
Rose could see that.

24:05.376 --> 24:07.344
Do you deny making this?

24:07.378 --> 24:10.914
It was found in your rooming house.

24:10.948 --> 24:13.950
I'm going to assume that it's
the key to your sister's ward.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.353
Do you deny that?

24:18.823 --> 24:21.024
Where did you get the
key to make this mold?

24:21.058 --> 24:23.793
That prison guard left it on his desk.

24:23.828 --> 24:26.830
Rose didn't deserve to be in there.

24:26.864 --> 24:28.932
We were going to leave the city,

24:28.966 --> 24:33.737
- start a new life.
- And yet she ended someone else's.

24:33.771 --> 24:36.539
- Why would she do that?
- She wouldn't.

24:36.573 --> 24:38.974
All she wanted to do was be with me.

24:39.009 --> 24:42.545
She wouldn't have risked
that by killing that nurse.

24:42.579 --> 24:46.149
She wouldn't have risked
losing that chance.

24:46.183 --> 24:48.751
She loves me.

24:51.587 --> 24:53.488
Rose...

24:53.523 --> 24:56.925
can I see the key your
brother Cedric gave you?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.394
He didn't give me anything.

24:59.428 --> 25:01.764
Miss Maxwell, your brother told me

25:01.798 --> 25:04.499
he gave you a key so you
could escape from this door.

25:06.469 --> 25:08.436
Rose?

25:18.514 --> 25:20.848
Thank you.

25:26.989 --> 25:28.823
It doesn't fit.

25:28.857 --> 25:30.958
Of course, it doesn't.

25:30.993 --> 25:34.095
But that's why I have to get
out of here. Can't you see?

25:34.129 --> 25:36.664
I don't understand.

25:36.699 --> 25:38.566
Cedric can't live in this world alone.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.268
He talked for months about
how he was going to get me

25:41.303 --> 25:44.071
out of here, how he was going to save me,

25:44.105 --> 25:46.873
how we could start over.

25:46.908 --> 25:48.942
He's my younger brother
and I love him but...

25:48.976 --> 25:50.744
But what?

25:50.778 --> 25:53.681
He is an incompetent.

25:53.715 --> 25:56.283
Nothing Cedric does ever works!

25:56.318 --> 25:58.284
He picked a harpy for a bride.

25:58.319 --> 26:00.687
He picked a lawyer who fleeced him dry.

26:00.722 --> 26:05.092
I have to be out in the
world to protect him.

26:07.095 --> 26:10.363
Miss Maxwell, if the
key your brother gave you

26:10.397 --> 26:12.365
didn't unlock the door,

26:14.401 --> 26:16.769
I...

26:16.803 --> 26:19.739
pulled on the door, and it opened.

26:19.773 --> 26:22.908
I thought it was a gift from God.

26:22.943 --> 26:27.513
He was rewarding us,
even though Cedric failed.

26:27.548 --> 26:29.649
And why didn't you just leave?

26:29.683 --> 26:32.417
Meet your brother and
escape? He booked tickets.

26:34.487 --> 26:37.256

26:37.290 --> 26:39.424

Rose opened those doors.

27:01.447 --> 27:03.414
forgetting to secure Rose's door.

27:03.448 --> 27:05.583
But opening all of them?
That was a deliberate act.

27:05.617 --> 27:08.253

look at all these files.

Collins and is blaming Rose.

Right. I'll see you later then, Julia.

Oh, she's getting anxious.

Please Dr. Ogden, can you just
look at her. She's not well.

32:27.474 --> 32:29.542
Why are you doing this to me?

32:29.576 --> 32:31.544
Because you're vindictive and cruel.

32:31.578 --> 32:34.347
You know I don't belong in here,
but you are keeping me here,

None of us in here are very happy with you.

33:27.199 --> 33:29.866
I had my practice in
another part of the building.

I never even associated with Nurse Collins.

33:32.103 --> 33:35.906

- Rose killed her?

33:35.940 --> 33:39.176
So, if I'm to understand you correctly,

33:39.211 --> 33:42.112
you're pleading ignorance?
Is that your excuse?

33:42.146 --> 33:44.448
It is not an excuse, it's a fact.

33:46.017 --> 33:47.951

- I didn't even know...
- A wise woman

33:52.056 --> 33:54.725

Charlotte,

34:07.003 --> 34:09.205
is that you?

Charlotte, you have to help me.
I know you're not a murderer.

34:12.476 --> 34:15.945

- I can't stop them.

34:17.947 --> 34:20.815
- (Rose): Please!
- There is a way out.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.985
- Show me.
- Won't tell them I told you?

34:23.018 --> 34:24.920
- Of course not.
- We have to hurry.

34:24.955 --> 34:26.668
There's a broken window in my bedroom.

34:26.668 --> 34:28.540
If you're careful, you can climb out.

34:36.065 --> 34:38.800
- (Charlotte-Maddie laughing)
- Fooled you!

34:38.833 --> 34:41.835
If there was a broken window in here,
wouldn't we have left through it?

34:41.871 --> 34:44.973

thinking isn't making any sense!

34:55.050 --> 34:57.852

34:57.887 --> 34:59.687
She says she wants to make you better

34:59.721 --> 35:01.689

does is try and run away.

I don't want to leave. I
just want you to be quiet.

35:33.021 --> 35:37.057
- My girls need their sleep.
- Sleepy time!

35:37.091 --> 35:39.559
Don't. Stop it! Stop it!

35:39.593 --> 35:42.028

35:52.506 --> 35:54.941
- Get away from me!
- Let me help you with your babies.

35:54.975 --> 35:58.677
- Don't touch her!
- Hannah, I can help you.

35:58.712 --> 36:02.315
- Don't cry.
- She doesn't deserve any comfort.

36:02.349 --> 36:04.416
There's no greater sin than
that of hurting a child.

You reap what you sow.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.894
Friends everywhere.

36:18.365 --> 36:21.867
- Did he give you that key?
- Men give me a lot of things.

36:21.901 --> 36:23.768
- Why?
- Men are simple.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.871
I should be going.

36:25.905 --> 36:29.207
I'm sorry for what Nurse
Collins did to you all.

36:29.242 --> 36:31.343
I will try to make it right!

36:31.377 --> 36:33.178
Nurse Collins never did anything to me.

36:33.212 --> 36:35.747
Or them either, I'll wager.

36:35.781 --> 36:38.282
Then who did?

36:41.219 --> 36:43.688
Mr. Drainie.

36:43.722 --> 36:45.757
Not Nurse Collins.

36:45.791 --> 36:48.292
It was Mr. Drainie that
visited them at night.

36:48.326 --> 36:49.960
Very good.

36:49.995 --> 36:51.796
And you knew and you said nothing?

36:51.830 --> 36:56.033
Oh, I said plenty. I told
Nurse Collins about Mr. Drainie.

36:56.067 --> 36:58.302
She was horrified.

36:58.336 --> 37:00.971
And then I told Mr.
Drainie what I had told her.

37:01.006 --> 37:03.473
And he killed her.

37:03.508 --> 37:06.243
I saw it with my own eyes.

37:06.278 --> 37:08.279
Why did he unlock all of the doors?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.046
I told him to.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.215
I wanted to help these poor women.

37:12.249 --> 37:15.285
At least that's more than
anything you ever did for them.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.287
But you showed up before
anyone could get away.

37:17.321 --> 37:20.590
- Why didn't you tell us what you saw?
- That wouldn't have got me out of here.

37:20.625 --> 37:23.493
Only Mr. Drainie could do that.

37:23.528 --> 37:26.162
So I told Mr. Drainie I'd
be needing the key again.

37:28.098 --> 37:31.401
And then I told him I
wanted to see you in here,

37:31.435 --> 37:34.670

40:27.973 --> 40:30.340
If you hurt me,

40:30.374 --> 40:32.409
they'll all be locked away forever!

40:32.443 --> 40:35.012
And it will be your fault, Maddie!

40:35.046 --> 40:37.314
Charlotte, don't let her do this!

40:37.348 --> 40:42.552
Charlotte. I know what
Mr. Drainie did to you.

40:42.587 --> 40:45.122
He'll pay for it, I swear!

40:45.156 --> 40:47.790
I swear!

40:49.693 --> 40:54.164
Dr. Ogden?

40:54.198 --> 40:56.333
- What's wrong?
- (Clanking)

40:56.367 --> 40:58.701
Julia!

40:58.736 --> 41:00.703
- Julia.
- It was Drainie.

41:00.738 --> 41:02.705
Yes, yes, it's alright, I've got you.

41:02.740 --> 41:05.307
Well, you took your own
sweet time, didn't you?

41:21.451 --> 41:23.419
What did he say?

41:23.453 --> 41:25.421
He admits to taking

41:25.455 --> 41:27.623
liberties with some of the female patients.

41:27.657 --> 41:30.492
He would don a nurse's uniform and

41:30.527 --> 41:32.861
interfere with them.

41:32.896 --> 41:35.464
Most of them were drugged,
so they had no idea what was

41:35.498 --> 41:38.433
- happening to them.
- Except Eva.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.236
Mr. Drainie said Eva Pearce

41:41.270 --> 41:43.305
confronted him with the knowledge.

41:43.339 --> 41:46.641
And she also informed him that
she had told Nurse Collins.

41:46.675 --> 41:48.709
And he admits to killing her?

41:48.744 --> 41:50.711
Yes. He killed the nurse

41:50.746 --> 41:52.713
and then unlocked all of the doors.

41:52.748 --> 41:54.715
Good Lord!

41:54.750 --> 41:59.186
His real name is Jamison Wilkes.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.423
He was incarcerated
when he was 12 years old

42:02.458 --> 42:05.392
for the assault of his abusive father.

42:05.427 --> 42:08.830
He was in and out of institutions
most of his early years.

42:08.864 --> 42:12.399
It would appear his demons returned to him.

42:12.434 --> 42:14.568
I don't think the demons
ever leave, William.

42:14.602 --> 42:16.870
And the asylum

42:16.904 --> 42:19.006
never checked his
credentials? His past history?

42:19.040 --> 42:21.575
No, they did not.

42:21.609 --> 42:24.411
- Well, that is going to change.
- I should hope so.

42:24.446 --> 42:26.680
There's also not going to be

42:26.714 --> 42:29.850
a ward where patients
are kept in isolation.

42:29.884 --> 42:32.051
Can they be helped?

42:32.086 --> 42:35.489
At least they can be properly attended to.

42:35.523 --> 42:37.423
Where is Eva Pearce?

42:37.458 --> 42:39.926
Oh, I'm sure we'll find her.

42:39.961 --> 42:42.728
Or she'll find you.

42:46.033 --> 42:48.101
(people talking)

42:56.076 --> 42:58.077
Sir!

43:01.615 --> 43:05.016
I've been robbed, sir,
attacked most brutally.

43:05.050 --> 43:07.118
Could you help me?

43:07.152 --> 43:09.554
Please?

43:09.588 --> 43:11.789
Of course, madam.

43:11.824 --> 43:13.825
Of course.

43:17.407 --> 43:19.891
I'd like to introduce my
nephew Charlie Brackenreid.

43:19.902 --> 43:21.702

43:21.704 --> 43:23.837

- Hello, ladies.

43:23.839 --> 43:26.039
Just be sure to keep
this place to yourselves.

43:26.141 --> 43:27.441
We wouldn't want to be begin attracting

43:27.543 --> 43:28.742
the right sort of people.
