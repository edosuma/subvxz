WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:08.633
Papito,  taste the  pollo con ajo.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.845
My  abuelita  taught me how to make this
when I was a little girl.

00:11.928 --> 00:17.058
The key is to add
just a little bit of cigar ash.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.358
My  abuelita  used to put Vicodin
in her coffee.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.447
And her lemonade and her sandwiches.
Maybe she had a problem.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.910
Okay, I'm finished. No more leak.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.165
Wow. Nice work.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.834
As my father said to me
on my ninth birthday,

00:42.917 --> 00:44.169
"You don't need me anymore."

00:47.005 --> 00:48.631
By the power vested in me

00:48.715 --> 00:50.967
-by the Guild of the Custodial Arts--
-Not a thing.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.510
It is a thing. I'm the president.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.347
I dub thee handyman.

00:56.431 --> 01:00.477
Eh, check this out.
I was actually thinking "Handy ma'am."

01:03.229 --> 01:05.315
Oh, my...

01:05.398 --> 01:07.567
[both mimic explosions]

01:08.193 --> 01:11.946
Mami,  where have you been? I've been
cooking these  frijoles  for 20 minutes.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.699
Ugh, I try to make a house a home.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.246
I was driving in freaking circles,
looking for a spot.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.041
I had to park by the lake again
and get chased by the geese.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.585
That big one either hates me
or is in love with me.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.128
Either way, I don't like it.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.591
-Why don't you just park in your garage?
-What?

01:35.345 --> 01:38.973
-We don't have a garage.
-Yeah, you do. It's part of the lease.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.355
I figured you were using
all the garages for storage.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.900
Don't be ridiculous. I use my garage
for pickling and sea horse breeding.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.946
Anyway, of course you have a garage.
It's downstairs. It's--

01:53.029 --> 01:55.156
[groans]

02:04.332 --> 02:06.126
Oh...

02:09.337 --> 02:11.714
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.967
See, um...

02:14.050 --> 02:17.720
[clears throat] Little parched.
Let me just hydrate here.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.933
[gulping]

02:23.143 --> 02:26.563
Why did I not know I had a garage?

02:32.360 --> 02:34.654
I may have put a few things in there.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.866
[theme song playing]

03:24.871 --> 03:30.418
[scoffs] I cannot believe that you've been
hiding this from me all this time.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.461
Oh?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.756
I thought I had mentioned it.

03:36.299 --> 03:39.302
It rained for 17 days in a row
this winter.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.346
I walked from my car every night!

03:41.429 --> 03:45.266
Oh, I wish you had told me that.
There's a box of raincoats somewhere.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.355
Whatever,  Mami,  I am too excited to argue.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.398
Now I don't have to keep
those traffic cones in my trunk

03:52.482 --> 03:53.900
to fake out my parking competition.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.278
-Does that work?
-When I wear my yellow vest, it does.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.240
Come on, everybody, let's get this junk
out of here so I can park my car!

04:00.323 --> 04:01.824
No, no! This is not junk.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.661
I need everything here.

04:08.206 --> 04:12.001
Really,  Mami?  You need a whole box
of gardening gloves?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.753
We don't even have a garden.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.965
What if  papito  wants to be
Michael Jackson for Halloween?

04:20.468 --> 04:21.803
[imitates Michael Jackson]

04:25.974 --> 04:27.308
I'll be Spider-Man.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.355
There are, like, four boxes
of dusty old magazines.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.648
We could at least recycle them.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.068
Instead of your own  abuelita,
you think of the planet?

04:41.990 --> 04:46.619
So you just keep your filthy green hands
off my  Vanidades  magazines.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.956
What about all this fabric? Come on!

04:50.039 --> 04:52.041
There must be something in here
we can get rid of.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.004
There is.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.591
I'm not letting this go, Mother.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.137
I'm done parking ten blocks away

05:04.220 --> 05:06.931
and being chased through the park
by the geese!

05:07.640 --> 05:10.435
Ay,  Lupita, relax, huh? Ah,  mira.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.897
Put this on and the geese
will not chase you

05:14.981 --> 05:17.900
when they see what you have done
to their friends.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.614
Okay. I will get rid of some stuff

05:23.698 --> 05:25.575
and  papito  will help me.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.368
You make sure she does it.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.038
Ooh. [chuckles]

05:30.121 --> 05:31.497
I'mma keep this.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.251
Okay, your first solo mission
as a handy ma'am.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.920
Apartment 301. Herb and Sherb McGurb.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.257
Sherb?

05:41.340 --> 05:44.177
Her real name is Sheryl,
but she gets a kick out of Sherb.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.724
Ha-ha.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.143
Hello, Herb, Sherb.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.896
Schneider. [giggles]

05:58.399 --> 06:01.903
This is Elena Alvarez, my handyman mentee.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.197
Or handy-manatee.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.992
-Hello, dear.
-Hi.

06:08.076 --> 06:12.038
This is her first job, but don't worry.
I taught her everything I know.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.918
-So, you good? You got your plunger?
-Yes.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.461
-Got your toilet snake?
-Yes.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.880
-Got your snack?
-I'm not going to eat a snack

06:20.963 --> 06:23.132
while I plunge and snake a toilet.

06:24.258 --> 06:28.012
The toilet is a cruel mistress. [sighs]

06:28.096 --> 06:30.181
She is flush with complications.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.562
She's ready.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.816
Oh, oh, one more thing.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.237
You're gonna see a glass in there
with teeth in it.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.116
No matter how much you're tempted,
do not put them in your mouth.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.292
So, did you get rid of some stuff?

06:58.376 --> 06:59.794
Even better than that.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.754
No.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.135
Papito  helped me arrange everything
so there's plenty of room for your car.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.389
A little to the left.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.975
[exclaiming]

07:15.184 --> 07:17.603
[speaks Spanish, laughs]

07:17.687 --> 07:18.938
Perfecto.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.985
Can the garage door even shut?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.239
Uh, kind of.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.575
See?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.120
Now back up so I can get out.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.753
Hey, Schneider.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.713
[shushes]

07:47.091 --> 07:49.093
[sighing] What's up?

07:49.844 --> 07:53.139
So this is what Schneider looks like
at his most Schneider-y.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.225
Since when do you do bonsai?

07:56.309 --> 07:59.145
[scoffs] Bonsai's for dorks.

07:59.228 --> 08:03.149
This is  penjing.
The gentle Chinese art of tray scenery.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.403
Now that you're working for me,
I finally have some leisure time.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.198
Oh, look, there's little people.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.033
Wait, is that my family?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.872
Could be any Cuban family.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.419
I just came to tell you that
I'm done fixing the McGurbs' toilet.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.507
What? You were there for 20 minutes.
It's at least an hour-and-a-half job.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.634
For you, maybe.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.013
You must have done something wrong.

08:34.096 --> 08:37.642
Actually, I noticed
you just replaced the flapper,

08:37.725 --> 08:39.393
which is more of a Band-Aid.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.230
So I went ahead and installed
a pressure assist flush valve

08:42.313 --> 08:43.940
and now it's fixed for good.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.028
You must have done something wrong.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.033
Look, it's nothing against you.
I'm just a really quick learner.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.577
Maybe I could help you be better.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.205
[stammers] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.291
I am the mentor here, Little Miss Thang.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.379
I may only look two or three years
older than you,

09:06.462 --> 09:09.257
but I have the wisdom
of that ancient bonsai!

09:09.340 --> 09:11.384
-You just said--
-It's all the same stuff!

09:18.849 --> 09:19.850
[scoffs]

09:20.309 --> 09:21.352
Was that me?

09:21.435 --> 09:24.397
Not every gay, teenage,
Cuban girl figurine is you!

09:33.656 --> 09:34.699
Well, my car got hit!

09:34.782 --> 09:36.117
-[gasps] No!
-Are you okay?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.410
Yes, because I wasn't in it.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.704
I was about to leave and I noticed
that somebody clipped it

09:39.787 --> 09:43.291
because I had to park it with its
big ol' butt sticking out of the garage!

09:43.374 --> 09:45.793
Oh, I was afraid of this.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.671
The garage does not like you.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.260
So, it's taking out its revenge.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.178
Mami,  no. I've had it.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.347
Now we have to spend money
we don't have to fix the car.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.516
Enough is enough.
You have to get rid of your junk.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.144
As a matter of fact, I already did.

10:05.646 --> 10:06.814
Alex, is that true?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.317
Uh...

10:14.113 --> 10:18.451
Of course it is true.
I cleared out the exercise bicycle.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.120
The lawn chair. Even my old fabrics.

10:41.015 --> 10:44.393
And you said there was no room
for these things. [chuckles]

10:45.728 --> 10:47.521
Don't you feel foolish?

10:50.107 --> 10:51.067
[sighs]

10:51.150 --> 10:52.693
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.197
-You're fired.
-What? Why?

10:56.280 --> 11:01.077
I got a call from the McGurbs.
Herb is very perturbed.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.456
You've worked on that
all day, haven't you?

11:05.539 --> 11:07.124
Don't be absurd!

11:08.626 --> 11:12.213
Herb said that they don't want you
working at their apartment anymore

11:12.296 --> 11:14.548
because they didn't like your attitude.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.219
What? That's crazy.
I was completely polite and professional.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.179
Yeah. Those aren't the words Herb used.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.517
For a pastor,
he knows some salty language.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.813
Anyway, walk me through everything you did
while you were there.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.983
Okay. Well, they offered me some lemonade,
and I said, "No, thank you--"

11:33.067 --> 11:36.987
What? Always take the lemonade.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.490
That's Handyman 101!

11:39.573 --> 11:41.659
[groaning] Oh, my God! Okay.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.416
So you watched  Jeopardy  with them
and then what?

11:48.499 --> 11:52.044
Why would I watch TV with them?
I just fixed their stuff and left.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.713
[hyperventilating]

11:57.425 --> 11:59.677
Well, now we know what your problem is!

12:01.429 --> 12:05.266
You fixed their toilet,
but you didn't fix their souls.

12:07.476 --> 12:11.021
-Is that some kind of Chinese proverb?
-Probably.

12:12.189 --> 12:17.987
[sighs] Elena, growing up,
I had everything.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.489
But I was always alone.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.870
I don't want my tenants to feel that way,
so I, I do more than just fix stuff.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.999
Apartment 306, macramé with Mrs. Watson.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.834
201, lose at chess to Mr. Roth.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.253
-402, listen to all their Cuban nonsense--
-Excuse me?

12:34.336 --> 12:35.379
That's the job.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.134
That's what takes four hours.

12:41.010 --> 12:41.886
[sighs]

12:42.595 --> 12:47.016
That's the difference between
being a handyman and a super.

12:48.809 --> 12:49.894
Understand?

12:50.519 --> 12:54.440
Yeah, I guess. I feel bad.
Should I go apologize to the McGurbs?

12:54.523 --> 12:57.568
Uh, during  NCIS?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.070
Don't make it worse.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.658
Okay, I feel weird.
My heart's beating out of my chest,

13:04.742 --> 13:06.619
my upper lip is sweating,
and I feel like hiding

13:06.702 --> 13:08.204
and trimming a tiny tree.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.041
Is this what failure is?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.296
Hey, hey, hey.

13:17.379 --> 13:21.175
I know you'll do it right next time.
And there will be a next time.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.510
So, I'm not fired?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.595
Nah, I just said that to be dramatic.

13:26.263 --> 13:30.726
It's cool, right? Never said it before.
And I've heard it a lot.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.190
Check it out.
Abuelito's  guayabera almost fits me.

13:36.273 --> 13:42.238
Ay, papito,  you look so handsome!
Just like your  abuelo.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.197
[sobs]

13:43.280 --> 13:44.615
Abuelita,  are you okay?

13:44.698 --> 13:48.035
[voice breaking] Just happy tears,  papito.
Happy tears.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.538
[sniffles] Lots of very good memories.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.997
[speaking Spanish]

13:53.999 --> 13:55.251
Aww.

13:55.876 --> 14:01.465
It's my mom, holding hands with my son,
who's dressed as my dad.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.719
That's not weird.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.765
Don't listen to her. You could be a model.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.647
[laughing]

14:16.730 --> 14:20.359
And you know what?
We could be in a JCPenney catalog.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.028
Hello.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.032
I always loved  Papi  in this.
He always looked so elegant.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.952
Ah. Nobody wore a guayabera
like your Papi.

14:32.371 --> 14:36.667
Okay,  Mami,  I can see how keeping
some of this stuff around might be nice.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.461
Ay,  thank you, Lupita.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.340
You know, I was thinking
about what you said

14:43.424 --> 14:48.554
and perhaps I don't have to
keep everything. Ah?

14:48.637 --> 14:50.931
[exclaims] I'm so glad
to hear you say that,  Mami.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.518
Alex, bring up the  Vanidades  magazines

14:54.602 --> 14:56.562
so I can look through them
and decide which to keep.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.900
Actually,  Mami,  why don't you start
with your VHS tapes of  The Love Boat?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.861
Who died and made you Captain Stubing?

15:05.863 --> 15:07.281
We start with the magazines.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.658
What?

15:10.409 --> 15:13.120
Okay. So I didn't think
you'd be reasonable about this

15:13.203 --> 15:15.122
so I took your  Vanidades
to the thrift store.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.207
[gasps]

15:18.876 --> 15:20.794
Mami,  you were being impossible!

15:20.878 --> 15:22.922
[speaking Spanish]

15:23.005 --> 15:25.758
Ay, por favor, Mami,  stop being
dramatic. It's not that big of a deal.

15:25.841 --> 15:29.595
I hid my savings bonds in the pages

15:29.678 --> 15:33.724
of one of those  Vanidades
to keep them safe.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.561
What?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.563
They were going to mature soon.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.108
And I was going to use
the money to help me

15:43.192 --> 15:48.197
with Elena's college
and  papito's  Barbizon Modeling School.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.660
Mami,  why didn't you keep them
somewhere safe?

15:52.743 --> 15:55.829
Oh, you mean keep them in a secret garage,

15:55.913 --> 15:59.875
where even my own daughter didn't know
for two decades? Ah, silly me.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.546
I didn't see anything like that.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.882
Come on. There's no way
you sold four boxes

16:06.966 --> 16:09.176
of dusty, old Spanish magazines
in two hours.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.513
I just sold a guy a used retainer.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.352
Can you please check again?

16:19.478 --> 16:20.771
-Of course.
-Thank you.

16:22.606 --> 16:23.482
Nope.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.319
Oh, you want to play hardball?

16:27.403 --> 16:28.278
Okay.

16:28.904 --> 16:33.742
Alex, how about
we try on a bunch of clothes

16:33.826 --> 16:38.205
and put none of them back on the hangers
and leave this place a freakin' disaster?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.335
This is a charity store
for cancer patients.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.798
I did not know that.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.845
Look, if they're not in the store,
they might be in the dumpster out back.

16:52.928 --> 16:56.015
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I am so sorry for what I said.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.642
I am a nurse. I love cancer patients.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.896
So, out back? Okay.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.399
Okay, hop in and find the magazines.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.528
What? I'm not going in there.
This is how most  Law & Orders  start.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.405
Well, I'm not going in there.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.701
But you're always talking about
how strong you are. "Oh, I'm a badass!"

17:17.036 --> 17:19.121
You know why you should go in there?

17:22.583 --> 17:23.625
I am a badass.

17:34.845 --> 17:35.846
Ah.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.643
I am sorry you are sad about your job.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.314
Let  The Love Boat  set its course

17:45.397 --> 17:46.940
for happiness.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.526
-Pretty progressive...
-Mmm.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.945
...that Julie, the cruise director,
was so openly gay.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.363
[sputters] What? Huh?

17:55.574 --> 17:58.702
All right,  Mami,  we got the  Vanidades!

17:58.786 --> 18:00.746
[speaking Spanish]

18:00.829 --> 18:02.790
-Did you get all of them?
-[Penelope] Yeah.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.374
[laughs]

18:04.458 --> 18:06.794
Okay, I'll start dinner.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.922
Wait, where are you going?
We have to find your savings bonds!

18:10.005 --> 18:13.634
Everybody, grab a stack and start looking.
Mami,  come on. Let's find the bonds!

18:14.259 --> 18:17.679
There are no bonds.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.979
Excuse me?

18:27.189 --> 18:30.859
The things you're looking for?
They do not exist. Ha-ha!

18:33.487 --> 18:35.531
You... You lied to me?

18:35.614 --> 18:39.660
Do you think if I had secret money
I would be shopping at Marshalls?

18:41.328 --> 18:43.664
The answer is yes. I love Marshalls.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.586
And I would shop there even more.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.674
But what about my college?

18:53.757 --> 18:55.342
You'll get a student loan.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.387
-What about my modeling school?
-You'll get a scholarship.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.604
Are you freaking kidding me right now?

19:08.981 --> 19:12.526
Don't mess with my stuff.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.157
We spent the day in a dumpster!

19:18.657 --> 19:19.867
"We"?

19:22.911 --> 19:26.748
You threw away  tu mami's
most cherished  cositas!

19:26.832 --> 19:30.502
Oh, I'm about to drop a match in  mi mami's
most cherished  cositas!

19:31.128 --> 19:34.173
And I'm about to take a baseball bat
to your precious car!

19:34.256 --> 19:35.549
Try me,  vieja.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.385
Ooh, ooh...

19:38.468 --> 19:39.428
I will.

19:39.511 --> 19:45.434
And I have six bats to choose from
in the garage. Wood, Wiffle, metal--

19:45.517 --> 19:46.643
Mami.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.026
I work my  nalgas  off
to support this family,

19:54.109 --> 19:55.986
and I deserve a place to park my car!

19:56.069 --> 19:58.697
And besides,
you never use any of this stuff anyway.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.199
You pack it away forever!

20:00.282 --> 20:02.910
Some of them are for special occasions!

20:02.993 --> 20:06.705
Oh, like the precious china
we've never even seen?

20:06.788 --> 20:12.169
I was keeping it safe for you,
to pass it down to Alex and Elena,

20:12.252 --> 20:14.463
so they could pass it down
to their children!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.257
Why don't we pass down an empty box
that says "China"? It'll be lighter!

20:19.301 --> 20:21.720
Mami,  you have a problem.

20:21.803 --> 20:25.515
There is an entire television show
devoted to people like you.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.645
I know, and it's called
Dancing with the Stars  and it is fabulous!

20:35.901 --> 20:37.444
I meant  Hoarders.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.532
It is a sickness to keep worthless things.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.369
I came to America with nothing!

20:45.452 --> 20:48.830
-All is valuable when you have nothing!
-I get it...

20:48.914 --> 20:52.960
[stammers] But this broken lawn chair?
A cracked teapot?

20:53.043 --> 20:55.921
Mami,  what is this?
This ratty, used umbrella.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.424
Mami,  what kind of value
could this possibly have?

21:08.225 --> 21:10.644
I was at the park with your  papi  one day.

21:11.728 --> 21:16.483
We were having a picnic to cheer him up
because he had lost his job.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.569
He was so worried about money,

21:20.654 --> 21:24.616
and I knew that the news I had to give him
would not help.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.535
So...

21:26.618 --> 21:30.330
[inhales deeply] I took a big swig of rum

21:32.124 --> 21:35.377
and a slow drag on my cigar,

21:37.379 --> 21:39.715
and I told him I was pregnant with you.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.224
It was the '70s!

21:50.851 --> 21:52.561
Anyways, it began to rain.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.106
And Berto opened this and put it over us.

21:57.065 --> 22:02.029
And he said, "I will always protect you,
mis vidas."

22:03.405 --> 22:07.534
And that was the first moment we spent
as a family,

22:09.703 --> 22:11.246
under this umbrella.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.672
That's beautiful,  Mami.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.301
You want to know what  papi  and I
did on this lawn chair?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.343
No.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.444
It may sound silly,

22:42.527 --> 22:46.281
but even those old magazines
mean something to me.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.452
Because it was all I could read
when I got here,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.623
because they were in Spanish.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.586
And they made me feel like a girl again,

23:00.420 --> 23:04.216
instead of just an exile.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.223
[sighs]

23:12.849 --> 23:14.017
So, what do we do?

23:16.144 --> 23:18.605
You want to keep these things
that matter to you,

23:20.357 --> 23:23.527
I need to park my car
without being bitten by a goose.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.201
I don't know how to fix this.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.248
I think I do.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.751
[exclaims] Elena,
these shelves are amazing.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.713
Ay, sí.  They solve everything! [sighs]

23:43.797 --> 23:46.842
Ooh, and I didn't just build shelves
in the garage,

23:46.925 --> 23:49.344
I built shelves in their souls.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.389
That only works for toilets.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.434
But I'm proud of you.
What you did here is really...

23:58.979 --> 23:59.980
super.

24:01.731 --> 24:05.777
Ooh, and I made us something.
I'm pretty excited about it. [grunts]

24:06.820 --> 24:07.821
Bam!

24:08.280 --> 24:09.531
We have handy caps!

24:11.032 --> 24:13.034
Yeah, we gotta talk about our branding.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.080
How about I make us all some dinner
to celebrate?

24:17.164 --> 24:20.667
-[gasping] And we can eat it on the china.
-Ooh. Okay.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.128
Ooh, Lydia, I think we moved the china
to the other garage.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.212
Other garage?
