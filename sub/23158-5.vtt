WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:03.392
Which is it, Colonel?
Lover or spy?

00:03.443 --> 00:04.740
I believe both.

00:06.045 --> 00:07.808
Michelle's alive,
and she's here.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.245
I'm gonna find her.

00:09.315 --> 00:11.306
Why hasn't she contacted you?

00:11.384 --> 00:12.476
Who is this Magnum?

00:12.552 --> 00:14.611
I don't know.
Perhaps your wife does.

00:14.687 --> 00:17.178
The President just promoted
you to full Commander.

00:17.256 --> 00:19.690
And they give the condemned
man a terrific last meal.

00:19.759 --> 00:21.226
I asked Michelle
to be my wife.

00:22.362 --> 00:23.386
We've been hit!

00:23.454 --> 00:25.922
Even you couldn't make up
a story this bizarre.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.626
Michelle, behind you!

00:28.067 --> 00:29.398
Michelle!

04:12.792 --> 04:13.850
No!

04:22.335 --> 04:23.597
Michelle.

04:28.989 --> 04:30.752
<i>Dreams are</i>
<i>supposed to represent</i>

04:30.777 --> 04:33.337
<i>your subconscious</i>
<i>wishes and conflicts.</i>

04:33.362 --> 04:36.798
<i>Sort of a private movie</i>
<i>you write, produce and direct.</i>

04:37.403 --> 04:40.167
<i>Only you can't hide your eyes</i>
<i>in your dreams.</i>

04:40.192 --> 04:42.888
<i>Even when they're</i>
<i>scaring you to death.</i>

04:55.482 --> 04:56.779
Hi, guys.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.415
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>and you're wrong.</i>

04:59.508 --> 05:00.975
<i>The dogs and I</i>
<i>have had a truce</i>

05:01.000 --> 05:02.433
<i>for a couple of months now.</i>

05:02.521 --> 05:03.681
<i>They let me alone,</i>

05:03.706 --> 05:05.970
<i>and I give them</i>
<i>a steak once a week.</i>

05:06.766 --> 05:08.358
<i>Of course, this week,</i>

05:08.488 --> 05:10.547
<i>all I could afford</i>
<i>was hamburger.</i>

05:24.931 --> 05:25.955
Higgins!

05:32.095 --> 05:33.926
Higgins, do something.

05:35.173 --> 05:36.834
Zeus, Apollo, sit.

05:39.679 --> 05:41.078
Higgins,
I'm getting tired

05:41.147 --> 05:43.047
of playing Little Eva
on the ice floe.

05:43.115 --> 05:45.709
You're dripping all over Robin
Masters' Persian carpets.

05:45.785 --> 05:47.412
Salt water, at that.

05:47.486 --> 05:49.044
Well, that's usually
what happens

05:49.121 --> 05:50.986
when one swims in the ocean.

05:51.891 --> 05:54.724
One usually showers with fresh
water before entering a house.

05:54.794 --> 05:57.092
Some people have been known
to towel themselves off.

05:57.163 --> 05:59.631
Well, that's a little hard to
do with these two on my butt.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.248
No offence, guys.

06:02.828 --> 06:04.659
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
I simply forgot

06:04.684 --> 06:06.242
to pull them in
from night patrol.

06:06.505 --> 06:08.132
You simply forgot?

06:08.207 --> 06:10.402
Come, Magnum, let's not make
a big production out of it.

06:10.476 --> 06:11.807
Look upon it is
as a simple test.

06:11.877 --> 06:12.901
A test?

06:12.979 --> 06:15.914
Yes, of your endurance,
your speed,

06:15.982 --> 06:17.347
their teeth.

06:23.356 --> 06:25.449
What have you
been doing all night, Higgins?

06:25.524 --> 06:27.321
You been up toasting
the regiment?

06:27.393 --> 06:29.486
I have been up
all night writing.

06:29.562 --> 06:32.190
I'm on what is known as
a creative high.

06:36.335 --> 06:38.997
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

06:40.139 --> 06:41.663
Higgins, I think
it's been published.

06:41.741 --> 06:43.402
That's known
as priming the pump.

06:43.476 --> 06:45.171
I shall rewrite that
on my edit.

06:45.278 --> 06:46.267
Oh.

06:47.079 --> 06:48.603
"Much of my formative years

06:48.681 --> 06:50.615
"were spent on
the cricket fields of England.

06:50.683 --> 06:53.049
I was known as
Little Jonathan."

06:53.219 --> 06:55.346
Oh, Higgins,
you're writing your memoirs.

06:55.421 --> 06:56.547
Oh, how droll.

06:56.622 --> 06:58.180
Give me that.
No.

06:59.425 --> 07:00.653
"This nom de guerre

07:00.726 --> 07:02.193
"was an obvious reference

07:02.261 --> 07:04.821
"to Robin Hood's companion,
Little John.

07:05.631 --> 07:07.496
"For by the age of 14,

07:07.566 --> 07:10.091
"I had attained
the weight of 15 stone

07:10.169 --> 07:12.262
and a height of 6 feet."

07:13.139 --> 07:14.572
What do you want, Magnum?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.471
Nothing.
I was escorted in here.

07:16.542 --> 07:18.442
Well, if you don't want
to be escorted out,

07:18.511 --> 07:19.773
I suggest you hand me
that page

07:19.845 --> 07:21.210
and dry off.

07:25.685 --> 07:27.312
Six feet?

07:28.154 --> 07:30.782
Let's see, I'm 6-foot-4.

07:32.825 --> 07:34.053
Name it.

07:34.994 --> 07:36.427
Well, let's see,

07:36.595 --> 07:39.689
I could use a 35 mm
reflex camera.

07:47.573 --> 07:49.165
With the telephoto zoom,
please.

07:49.241 --> 07:50.469
That's a 200 mm lens.

07:50.543 --> 07:52.875
Robin Masters
paid $600 for that.

07:52.945 --> 07:54.606
15 stone.

07:55.348 --> 07:57.339
Let's see,
a stone is 14 pounds.

07:57.416 --> 07:59.077
That makes you...

07:59.852 --> 08:01.217
Thank you.

08:02.321 --> 08:04.050
Oh, by the way,
do you have any film?

08:04.123 --> 08:05.590
Zeus. Apollo.

08:05.658 --> 08:06.989
Ahh!

08:09.428 --> 08:10.759
Of course,

08:10.830 --> 08:13.060
I could always pick
some up in Honolulu.

08:14.066 --> 08:15.328
Bye, you guys.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.473
Sorry, lads.

08:23.843 --> 08:25.708
Perhaps tomorrow.

08:27.913 --> 08:30.211
<i>Sunsets in Hawaii</i>
<i>really are different.</i>

08:30.282 --> 08:31.874
<i>Warmer, intenser,</i>

08:31.951 --> 08:34.578
<i>more romantic than anywhere</i>
<i>I know in the worid.</i>

08:43.828 --> 08:45.922
<i>That is, if you have a girl.</i>

08:46.198 --> 08:47.460
<i>If you don't,</i>

08:47.533 --> 08:49.967
<i>sunsets in Hawaii</i>
<i>can be depressing.</i>

08:50.035 --> 08:52.629
<i>And when you're depressed,</i>
<i>there's only one thing to do.</i>

08:52.705 --> 08:54.730
<i>Lose yourself in</i>
<i>your work, which for me,</i>

08:54.807 --> 08:56.775
<i>happened to be</i>
<i>a divorce case.</i>

09:01.347 --> 09:03.747
<i>He was a used car dealer</i>
<i>from Toledo</i>

09:03.816 --> 09:05.909
<i>and she was a school teacher</i>
<i>from Cleveland.</i>

09:05.985 --> 09:08.146
<i>His wife hired me</i>
<i>to "get the goods on film,"</i>

09:08.220 --> 09:09.778
<i>as she put it.</i>

09:18.197 --> 09:19.664
<i>Now that I had the goods,</i>

09:19.732 --> 09:21.632
<i>I couldn't shake the feeling</i>

09:21.700 --> 09:23.964
<i>that I had just killed</i>
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

09:24.937 --> 09:26.131
Thank you.

09:26.205 --> 09:27.502
<i>I didn't like the wife.</i>

09:27.573 --> 09:29.871
<i>She was a little too anxious</i>
<i>to nail the little guy.</i>

09:29.942 --> 09:32.433
<i>It didn't have anything to do with him,</i>
<i>Just his money.</i>

09:32.511 --> 09:33.910
<i>She was drooling</i>
<i>over the thought</i>

09:33.979 --> 09:35.970
<i>of getting half</i>
<i>of his used-car lot.</i>

09:36.682 --> 09:38.741
<i>So why did I take the case?</i>

09:38.818 --> 09:41.082
<i>A guy has gotta eat</i>
<i>to survive.</i>

09:41.153 --> 09:43.348
<i>Or in my case,</i>
<i>feed the dogs.</i>

09:51.030 --> 09:53.055
<i>Maybe it was the sunset.</i>

09:53.432 --> 09:54.797
<i>Maybe it was just</i>

09:54.867 --> 09:56.960
<i>that the two of them</i>
<i>were obviously in love.</i>

09:58.971 --> 10:00.495
<i>Or maybe, just maybe,</i>

10:00.573 --> 10:02.336
<i>I'd done one divorce case</i>
<i>too many.</i>

10:13.219 --> 10:15.346
<i>Whatever it was,</i>
<i>tossing the goods overboard</i>

10:15.421 --> 10:17.480
<i>sure made me</i>
<i>feel a lot better.</i>

10:28.367 --> 10:30.130
<i>There's a saying</i>
<i>I've always loved:</i>

10:30.202 --> 10:32.466
<i>"Living well is</i>
<i>the best revenge."</i>

10:33.472 --> 10:36.566
<i>Obviously, the people</i>
<i>on the yacht knew it well.</i>

10:36.842 --> 10:39.504
<i>My envy was fast changing</i>
<i>to curiosity.</i>

10:39.578 --> 10:42.172
<i>Occidentals and Orientals</i>
<i>on million-dollar yachts</i>

10:42.248 --> 10:44.910
<i>aren't a common sight,</i>
<i>even in Hawaii.</i>

12:16.208 --> 12:19.439
That's Michelle.
It's got to be.

12:30.255 --> 12:32.155
What is going on here?

12:33.125 --> 12:36.060
Higgins,
the red light was on.

12:36.395 --> 12:38.727
Magnum, this area
is off limits.

12:38.797 --> 12:41.027
Consenting to let you use
Robin Masters' camera

12:41.100 --> 12:43.500
in no way implied
rights to the darkroom.

12:43.569 --> 12:45.036
Rules are rules.

12:45.104 --> 12:47.265
Without them,
our life here would be chaos.

12:47.506 --> 12:50.339
Of course, it's chaos with them,
but that's beside the point.

12:50.409 --> 12:53.708
I will not have my generosity
taken as a sign of weakness.

12:54.246 --> 12:56.578
Magnum,
are you listening to me?

12:57.383 --> 13:00.011
Higgins,
don't open that door, please.

13:05.257 --> 13:06.656
This will cost you dearly.

13:06.725 --> 13:07.919
I know.

13:10.162 --> 13:11.254
Another divorce case?

13:11.330 --> 13:12.297
No.

13:13.432 --> 13:14.922
Missing person?

13:15.167 --> 13:16.429
Yes.

13:17.636 --> 13:18.728
Anyone I know?

13:18.804 --> 13:19.793
No.

13:21.106 --> 13:22.596
Anyone famous?

13:23.609 --> 13:24.633
No.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.475
Higgins, please develop
the rest of the negatives.

13:27.546 --> 13:28.945
I'll be back in
a couple of hours.

13:29.014 --> 13:30.106
No.

13:30.182 --> 13:32.082
Come on, Higgins,
I gave you carte blanche.

13:32.151 --> 13:33.709
Precisely.
So why in the Queen's name

13:33.786 --> 13:35.617
should I do your
tedious photographic work?

13:35.688 --> 13:36.916
Especially when I have

13:36.989 --> 13:39.389
my African campaign photos
to copy.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.256
Because it's very, very
important to me.

13:51.970 --> 13:53.096
<i>You hit 20?</i>

13:53.172 --> 13:54.366
Uh-huh.

13:54.440 --> 13:55.464
Nobody hits 20.

13:55.541 --> 13:56.565
I do.

13:56.642 --> 13:57.631
Well, you're nuts.

13:57.710 --> 13:58.734
Who won?

13:58.811 --> 14:02.008
2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 14.

14:02.281 --> 14:03.805
I'm $14 up on you.

14:03.882 --> 14:05.179
Take a look at this.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.842
Thomas, you won't
believe what he did.

14:06.919 --> 14:07.943
Who is she, guys?

14:08.020 --> 14:09.248
He hit on 20. 20!

14:09.321 --> 14:10.811
Damn it, Rick!

14:12.424 --> 14:14.619
Will you look at the picture?

14:18.530 --> 14:19.758
Please.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.292
Yeah.

14:28.107 --> 14:29.574
I don't know.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.399
Of course,
I can't see the face,

14:31.477 --> 14:33.172
especially with
the sunglasses on.

14:33.612 --> 14:35.705
But, man, believe me,
with a body like this,

14:35.781 --> 14:36.770
if I were...

14:38.050 --> 14:40.041
I don't know who she is.

14:44.723 --> 14:46.247
Neither do I.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.419
But I guess you do.

14:48.494 --> 14:50.359
Look, T.C.,
look at the hair.

14:50.429 --> 14:52.192
Look at
the shape of her face.

14:52.498 --> 14:54.796
Look at the way
she tilts her head.

14:56.702 --> 14:59.068
Look, T.M.,
I guess you know who she is,

14:59.138 --> 15:00.833
so why don't you tell us?

15:02.407 --> 15:03.897
It's Michelle.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.410
Why don't we take a walk?

15:16.488 --> 15:18.012
I don't want to take a walk.

15:19.191 --> 15:20.749
Yeah, but I do.

15:40.712 --> 15:42.179
You know, bro,

15:42.247 --> 15:44.579
I've never seen
Magnum act like this before.

15:46.985 --> 15:48.577
Who is this Michelle?

15:48.654 --> 15:49.746
<i>My wife.</i>

15:49.822 --> 15:52.120
I asked Michelle
to be my wife.

15:52.391 --> 15:55.121
You asked her to marry you?

15:55.194 --> 15:56.354
That's what I said.

15:56.428 --> 15:58.020
Yeah, well,
you must be nuts.

15:58.096 --> 15:59.996
No, just in love.

16:00.065 --> 16:02.090
Yeah, well, so am I,
but I don't marry 'em.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.191
Well, I do.

16:03.268 --> 16:05.600
Hey, don't you know
there's a war going on?

16:06.171 --> 16:07.331
Where?

16:08.774 --> 16:09.866
Damn!

16:10.108 --> 16:11.632
We've been hit!

16:15.414 --> 16:18.850
You see what even thinking
about marriage can get you?

16:43.242 --> 16:46.268
Remember that time you took me
surfing off Nha Trang?

16:47.346 --> 16:48.870
Man,
up until that time,

16:48.947 --> 16:50.505
the only waves I had seen

16:50.582 --> 16:52.573
were the ones when
I slipped in the bathtub.

16:52.651 --> 16:55.017
But now, here I am

16:55.120 --> 16:57.384
out there where
the big chompers live

16:57.456 --> 16:59.617
on a little bitty board
trying to make

16:59.691 --> 17:01.784
like some Hollywood
hotshot in Malibu.

17:01.860 --> 17:03.020
She's alive, T.C.

17:03.095 --> 17:04.323
No, she ain't, man.

17:04.396 --> 17:06.990
I took that picture
of her yesterday.

17:07.366 --> 17:10.961
No, you took a picture
of someone who looked like her

17:11.036 --> 17:12.333
a little, from the side...

17:12.404 --> 17:13.496
A lot.

17:13.672 --> 17:14.832
From the front.

17:14.906 --> 17:16.135
I saw her face
from the front.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.607
Yeah? Well, how come

17:17.675 --> 17:19.337
you didn't take
a picture of her?

17:19.645 --> 17:20.976
I told you, I tried,

17:21.046 --> 17:23.105
but she turned ahead
just as I started shooting.

17:23.181 --> 17:24.808
I couldn't get another shot.

17:24.883 --> 17:27.750
Uh-huh. What about this
big, fancy yacht she was on?

17:27.819 --> 17:28.911
I couldn't find it.

17:28.987 --> 17:31.285
I searched Honolulu Harbor
until 5:00 this morning.

17:31.356 --> 17:32.687
It must have
gone up the coast

17:32.758 --> 17:34.157
or to one of
the other islands.

17:34.226 --> 17:35.625
Don't you see
what you're doin'?

17:35.694 --> 17:37.753
First you tell me
about this dream you had

17:37.829 --> 17:39.660
about Michelle,
about trying to save her.

17:39.731 --> 17:42.359
Then the very next day,
you see her on this big yacht

17:42.434 --> 17:44.163
through the long lens
of your camera.

17:44.236 --> 17:46.830
You can't get a picture
unless her back is to you.

17:46.905 --> 17:49.032
And even though
you're a private investigator,

17:49.107 --> 17:50.768
you can't find
an 80 or 90-foot yacht.

17:50.842 --> 17:53.174
You think I'm hallucinating,
that I'm crazy?

17:53.245 --> 17:54.644
No. For what?

17:54.713 --> 17:56.578
For wishing someone
you love back to life?

17:56.648 --> 17:58.673
No, I don't think
that's crazy.

18:01.119 --> 18:03.019
I think trying
to find her is.

18:07.292 --> 18:08.816
Michelle is dead.

18:08.961 --> 18:10.485
Our own people verified that.

18:10.562 --> 18:12.621
No. Bodies were found.

18:12.698 --> 18:14.393
They were burned
and in pieces.

18:14.466 --> 18:15.592
We were pulling out.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.929
It was our last day
in Saigon.

18:17.002 --> 18:18.526
Now, what if somebody
made a mistake?

18:18.603 --> 18:20.935
What if she wasn't in that
hospital when it was hit?

18:21.006 --> 18:22.064
Come on, Thomas.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.232
Now, hear me out!

18:23.375 --> 18:24.603
Damn it!

18:26.712 --> 18:28.577
Now, what if...

18:28.780 --> 18:31.476
What if somebody just assumed
that... that she was on duty

18:31.550 --> 18:33.950
and to keep the record straight,
he just counted the bodies,

18:34.019 --> 18:35.384
and checked the roster,

18:35.454 --> 18:38.014
and just let it go at that,
so he could get his butt out of Nam.

18:38.090 --> 18:40.251
Okay, okay, okay,
let's say you're right.

18:40.325 --> 18:44.125
Let's say she is alive
and here in the islands.

18:45.030 --> 18:47.225
Why hasn't she contacted you?

18:47.966 --> 18:49.957
Maybe she doesn't know
I'm here.

18:52.671 --> 18:54.161
Man, she's your wife.

18:54.239 --> 18:55.536
All she would
have to do

18:55.607 --> 18:57.666
would be to pick up
the phone and call the Navy.

18:57.743 --> 19:00.473
They'd tell her where you are,
at least your last location.

19:00.545 --> 19:03.343
Even better, she could have
looked you up in the phone book.

19:03.415 --> 19:05.940
No, see, I have thought
about that, T.C.

19:06.685 --> 19:08.710
I've thought about it a lot.

19:08.887 --> 19:11.515
Now, say she was
in that hospital

19:11.590 --> 19:14.081
when she was rocketed.

19:14.159 --> 19:16.252
I mean,
she would have been wounded.

19:16.328 --> 19:18.193
She might have been
buried in the rubble.

19:18.263 --> 19:19.753
So she is listed as killed.

19:19.831 --> 19:21.594
Charlie takes Saigon,
they find her,

19:21.666 --> 19:23.657
and they hold her
until she's able to escape,

19:23.735 --> 19:25.669
probably with
some boat people.

19:25.971 --> 19:30.431
Why hasn't she contacted you?

19:31.343 --> 19:33.402
Well, it would have all
been pretty traumatic.

19:33.478 --> 19:34.638
Maybe she has amnesia.

19:34.713 --> 19:35.771
You believe that?

19:35.847 --> 19:36.871
No, but it's possible!

19:36.948 --> 19:39.212
It's also possible I might
hook up with Diana Ross,

19:39.284 --> 19:40.410
but I ain't countin' on it.

19:40.485 --> 19:41.975
Well, I'll take
what I can get.

19:51.830 --> 19:54.765
You know, it took you
a long time

19:54.833 --> 19:57.267
to get over Michelle's death,
man, if you ever did.

19:58.737 --> 20:01.069
And you just should not go

20:01.139 --> 20:04.006
trying to scratch a wound
that's beginning to heal, man.

20:04.076 --> 20:06.442
You... you could get
infected real bad.

20:07.145 --> 20:08.407
Real bad.

20:27.097 --> 20:28.257
They're late.

20:28.332 --> 20:29.390
Yes.

20:29.466 --> 20:31.331
A negotiating ploy?

20:31.401 --> 20:32.891
We shall see.

20:33.003 --> 20:34.493
What shall you give them?

20:34.738 --> 20:36.865
Today, nothing.

20:37.608 --> 20:38.870
Tomorrow?

20:39.009 --> 20:41.910
I will decide that
after our meeting today.

20:42.913 --> 20:45.040
It never
ceases to amaze me.

20:45.248 --> 20:46.647
They're willing
to give up so much

20:46.717 --> 20:48.446
for nothing.

20:49.252 --> 20:54.121
The remains of their airmen
are not nothing to them.

20:54.691 --> 20:56.158
They are stupid.

20:56.226 --> 20:57.955
I suppose they are.

21:03.033 --> 21:06.230
Have you discovered
any leads to The Tiger?

21:06.870 --> 21:08.667
I've only been
here for 48 hours.

21:08.805 --> 21:10.636
You insisted
I go on that cruise.

21:10.707 --> 21:12.140
It takes time
to make contacts,

21:12.209 --> 21:13.574
to check my sources.

21:13.644 --> 21:16.408
The Tiger is very careful
and has the help

21:16.480 --> 21:18.209
of the American
intelligence community.

21:18.281 --> 21:19.680
You know, Col. Ki,

21:21.151 --> 21:23.244
I really don't
understand you.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.845
You are
extraordinarily competent,

21:26.356 --> 21:29.450
well-trained by
our KGB friend,

21:30.193 --> 21:34.823
I am sure the finest of
your type in all of Vietnam.

21:35.899 --> 21:37.696
You don't have
to make excuses

21:37.868 --> 21:39.301
and yet you do.

21:39.536 --> 21:40.594
Why?

21:40.671 --> 21:41.933
I was not making excuses.

21:42.105 --> 21:43.970
Merely pointing out
with accuracy

21:44.041 --> 21:45.201
what has transpired

21:45.275 --> 21:47.209
in the limited time
I have been in Hawaii.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.424
They did this on purpose!

22:25.515 --> 22:26.982
Present-hut!

22:42.666 --> 22:44.395
Forward-hut!

22:51.308 --> 22:54.334
Sorry we're late, General.
Equipment failure.

22:54.745 --> 22:57.043
I had to replace
one of my choppers.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.275
So I had my pilot
take a short cut,

22:59.349 --> 23:02.648
come in the back door,
so to speak, to save time.

23:02.719 --> 23:04.482
I hope we didn't
shake you up.

23:04.554 --> 23:06.317
Not at all, Admiral.

23:06.490 --> 23:09.789
But if you're having
equipment problems,

23:09.860 --> 23:11.555
perhaps we should discuss

23:11.695 --> 23:13.993
returning some of
your helicopters.

23:15.365 --> 23:17.492
We have quite
a collection of them

23:17.567 --> 23:18.556
in Vietnam.

23:22.839 --> 23:24.568
This way, gentlemen.

23:29.913 --> 23:32.780
Madam Hue, it's a pleasure
to see you again.

23:32.849 --> 23:34.578
And you, Admiral.

23:34.651 --> 23:36.209
I hope that after
your discussions

23:36.286 --> 23:37.446
with my husband,

23:37.521 --> 23:39.989
you and your officers
will join us for lunch.

23:40.056 --> 23:41.580
With pleasure.

23:41.658 --> 23:44.252
I have always
enjoyed Vietnamese cooking.

23:44.327 --> 23:46.261
After your talks, then.

23:46.830 --> 23:48.092
Admiral.

24:11.755 --> 24:14.315
<i>I would like to</i>
<i>propose a toast</i>

24:15.826 --> 24:18.590
to the luckiest
couple in Saigon,

24:18.795 --> 24:19.887
me and T.C.

24:21.097 --> 24:22.121
Say what?

24:22.199 --> 24:23.530
I mean it.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.502
We are the last
of the bachelors.

24:26.736 --> 24:28.897
Everyone else
we know is married.

24:28.972 --> 24:31.634
Orville, I've heard you say
some dumb things in my life,

24:31.708 --> 24:34.074
but that's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard you say.

24:34.144 --> 24:36.339
No, I think that's a good toast.
I'll drink to that.

24:36.413 --> 24:38.210
You'll drink to anything.

24:39.449 --> 24:41.178
You've only been
married three hours

24:41.251 --> 24:43.446
and already she's cuttin'
you off of the booze.

24:43.520 --> 24:46.080
Well, no bride wants to
see her man intoxicated

24:46.156 --> 24:47.350
on their wedding night.

24:50.727 --> 24:52.422
I mean, really...

24:53.396 --> 24:55.125
You're blushing.
No, I am not.

24:55.198 --> 24:57.189
Yes. Isn't he blushing?

24:57.567 --> 24:58.556
Mmm-hmm.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.464
Well, wouldn't you?

25:00.537 --> 25:02.061
Yeah,
but who would notice?

25:05.876 --> 25:07.343
And I
got one more toast.

25:07.410 --> 25:09.037
Yes.
No.

25:09.179 --> 25:11.147
And this one
is gonna kill you.

25:20.857 --> 25:22.654
Did you arrange this?

25:23.059 --> 25:24.117
Of course.

25:24.194 --> 25:25.718
What's a wedding
without fireworks?

25:27.797 --> 25:29.355
Thomas, I'm scared.

25:29.699 --> 25:31.098
So am I.

25:32.002 --> 25:35.062
At least if we both died now,
it would be okay.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.762
No it wouldn't.

25:36.907 --> 25:38.431
We'd die happy.

25:38.642 --> 25:40.542
I'd rather live happy.

25:42.913 --> 25:45.040
The Vietcong may not let us.

25:46.716 --> 25:49.651
You see, you see this?

25:49.920 --> 25:50.909
Hmm?

25:51.187 --> 25:53.815
That's magic stuff.
Nothing can get through it.

25:59.696 --> 26:00.685
You see.

26:05.568 --> 26:06.796
Don't worry.

26:06.870 --> 26:08.565
They're not going
to kill us, Michelle.

26:08.638 --> 26:10.003
I promise.

26:10.774 --> 26:12.139
It's okay.

26:36.299 --> 26:37.926
I say, Magnum,

26:39.703 --> 26:41.193
may I come in?

26:53.016 --> 26:56.577
I, uh, knocked
quite a few times.

26:56.653 --> 26:57.881
I'm sorry, Higgins.

26:57.954 --> 26:59.148
My mind was on
something else.

26:59.222 --> 27:01.087
What can I do for you?

27:02.258 --> 27:04.021
You could
offer me a drink.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.787
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry.

27:06.730 --> 27:08.493
Uh, brandy, please.

27:28.151 --> 27:29.277
To the regiment.

27:29.619 --> 27:30.779
To the regiment.

27:35.925 --> 27:38.155
Magnum, I don't know
if you're pulling my leg,

27:38.228 --> 27:40.287
as you Yanks put it,
or not,

27:40.363 --> 27:42.354
but you are acting
frightfully strange.

27:42.832 --> 27:44.060
Strange?

27:45.268 --> 27:46.360
Yes.

27:46.770 --> 27:48.294
You're being nice.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.531
I'm sorry, Higgins.

27:49.606 --> 27:51.198
I didn't know that was bad.

27:51.341 --> 27:53.036
No. With anyone else
it wouldn't be,

27:53.109 --> 27:55.009
but with you,
one must be suspicious.

27:55.945 --> 27:58.311
Well, I will try
and revert to type.

27:58.481 --> 28:01.348
Please. You're upsetting
our relationship.

28:01.584 --> 28:05.020
Being nice makes me
quite uncomfortable.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.282
Does that mean you
don't want anything

28:08.358 --> 28:10.326
for me using
the darkroom this morning?

28:11.227 --> 28:12.558
Not that uncomfortable.

28:14.064 --> 28:15.053
I'm debating

28:15.131 --> 28:16.792
whether to take
the Ferrari for a month

28:16.866 --> 28:19.596
or have you exercise the lads
until I'm done writing my memoirs.

28:19.669 --> 28:21.569
Exercise the dogs? How?

28:21.871 --> 28:24.203
By having them
chase you, of course.

28:26.943 --> 28:28.672
Well, I must be off.

28:28.745 --> 28:30.610
I'm writing
a frightfully exciting chapter

28:30.680 --> 28:32.341
on the woman
I almost married,

28:32.415 --> 28:33.848
the Lady Ashley.

28:34.150 --> 28:35.447
She was

28:36.186 --> 28:38.711
constructed like
the Prince Albert Memorial.

28:38.788 --> 28:39.777
All...

28:44.194 --> 28:46.355
Well, in any case,
she deserves a good chapter.

28:46.429 --> 28:48.795
Oh, by the by,
here are the prints

28:48.865 --> 28:50.890
you wanted me
to make for you.

28:54.037 --> 28:56.005
Well, I had
finished developing

28:56.072 --> 28:58.199
my campaign pictures

28:58.575 --> 29:00.941
and, uh, the solution
was still good. So...

29:08.585 --> 29:10.780
Higgins, that's really
very decent of you.

29:12.088 --> 29:13.919
Yes. It is, isn't it?

29:25.135 --> 29:26.932
<i>Maybe T.C. Was right.</i>

29:27.036 --> 29:29.129
<i>Maybe I didn't want</i>
<i>to let her go.</i>

29:29.205 --> 29:31.696
<i>Why didn't I take</i>
<i>a better picture of her?</i>

29:32.308 --> 29:33.832
<i>Was it because if I did,</i>

29:33.910 --> 29:35.878
<i>I'd see she really</i>
<i>wasn't Michelle?</i>

29:38.081 --> 29:39.173
<i>And what about the yacht?</i>

29:39.249 --> 29:40.477
<i>Why couldn't I find it?</i>

29:40.717 --> 29:42.048
<i>If I'd been thinking clearly,</i>

29:42.118 --> 29:43.710
<i>I guess I would</i>
<i>have thought to get</i>

29:43.786 --> 29:45.981
<i>a picture of the name</i>
<i>before it disappeared.</i>

30:04.774 --> 30:07.004
Magnum,
you're positively disgusting.

30:07.076 --> 30:09.135
Higgins, I'm not interested
in her decolletage,

30:09.212 --> 30:11.077
just what this is
around her neck.

30:11.147 --> 30:12.705
Were you be able
to lose the flare?

30:12.782 --> 30:13.942
Of course.

30:14.017 --> 30:17.384
I gave it a longer exposure,
approximately 35 seconds.

30:17.453 --> 30:19.785
But whatever it is,
it's going to be blurred.

30:19.856 --> 30:21.187
You realize of course

30:21.257 --> 30:23.521
that if you had shot this
at an f-16 instead of f-8,

30:23.593 --> 30:24.719
you would have had

30:24.794 --> 30:27.194
a greater depth of field
and a sharper image.

30:27.263 --> 30:29.356
A steadier hand
would have helped, too.

30:29.432 --> 30:30.899
Although I realize
the difficulty

30:30.967 --> 30:33.060
in holding focus
on a moving object,

30:36.372 --> 30:38.101
I remember once
off Kwangju...

30:38.174 --> 30:39.471
I was trying to take

30:39.542 --> 30:41.339
some combat photos
of a Japanese destroyer

30:41.411 --> 30:42.935
from the deck of
a motor torpedo boat

30:43.012 --> 30:44.172
on the attack.

30:44.247 --> 30:47.341
As you can imagine,
it was terribly difficult.

30:47.517 --> 30:49.246
I finally managed
to brace myself

30:49.319 --> 30:50.911
against
the forward launch tube.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.615
There I was,
eyes blinded by salt spray,

30:53.690 --> 30:55.851
hands trembling
with excitement.

30:56.626 --> 30:59.459
I really must remember
to put that in my memoirs.

31:01.297 --> 31:02.491
I say.

31:03.166 --> 31:06.465
That's the same French <i>croix</i>
you have on your ring.

31:12.108 --> 31:13.837
How bloody curious.

31:20.165 --> 31:21.257
General,

31:21.333 --> 31:23.460
you do admit
that a number of our pilots

31:23.535 --> 31:26.299
are buried in
North Vietnamese cemeteries.

31:30.675 --> 31:31.733
Yes.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.741
Then why can't you
return those remains?

31:35.580 --> 31:38.048
We sometimes buried

31:39.317 --> 31:42.252
three or four of your people
in a single grave

31:42.320 --> 31:44.880
marking them with
a Vietnamese name.

31:44.956 --> 31:46.253
And why was that?

31:51.029 --> 31:53.657
Most of our people
are simple farmers.

31:54.499 --> 31:55.932
If you knew

31:56.001 --> 31:58.868
where someone was buried
who had bombed your village,

31:58.937 --> 32:01.804
killed and murdered
your wife and babies,

32:01.873 --> 32:03.864
napalmed your parents,

32:04.876 --> 32:07.106
destroyed your
rice with poisons...

32:07.178 --> 32:09.476
General, this is not
a press conference.

32:09.781 --> 32:12.716
Would you please
simply answer the question?

32:15.220 --> 32:17.814
We buried them
in those graves

32:18.490 --> 32:20.117
to protect them.

32:20.892 --> 32:21.984
Yes.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.521
And we greatly appreciate
the steps you took

32:24.596 --> 32:26.496
to protect our dead.

32:26.564 --> 32:29.727
Now we would also appreciate
you returning them, now.

32:30.468 --> 32:33.164
Many of those cemeteries
were in villages

32:33.238 --> 32:36.935
bombed by your B-52s.

32:38.510 --> 32:40.341
The records were lost.

32:40.412 --> 32:42.437
Homes, schools, hospitals,

32:42.514 --> 32:46.883
even the cemeteries themselves
were destroyed.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.489
<i>I had made it a point</i>
<i>over the years</i>

32:57.562 --> 32:59.223
<i>to avoid</i>
<i>the section of Honolulu</i>

32:59.297 --> 33:00.764
<i>called "Little Saigon",</i>

33:00.832 --> 33:03.630
<i>afraid it would bring back</i>
<i>too many memories.</i>

33:05.570 --> 33:06.832
<i>But now that I knew</i>

33:06.905 --> 33:08.532
<i>Michelle was alive</i>
<i>and in the Islands,</i>

33:08.606 --> 33:11.040
<i>it was the first place</i>
<i>I thought to look for her.</i>

33:11.109 --> 33:12.770
<i>I'd lost her in Old Saigon.</i>

33:12.844 --> 33:14.869
<i>Maybe I could find her</i>
<i>in this new one.</i>

34:46.271 --> 34:47.601
What are you doing here?

34:47.672 --> 34:49.400
Oh, I got lonely
for the old days,

34:49.474 --> 34:50.907
thought I would come
down here

34:50.975 --> 34:52.533
to get a little
Oriental soul food.

34:52.610 --> 34:54.373
What do you think
I'm doin' here?

34:54.445 --> 34:55.639
I'm lookin' for you.

34:55.713 --> 34:57.237
Figured you might
need a little help.

34:57.315 --> 34:58.907
Hey, Thomas, what you...

34:59.117 --> 35:00.414
T.M., you've been...

35:00.718 --> 35:02.913
T.C., look, I appreciate
what you're doing.

35:02.987 --> 35:04.579
I know you got
the best intentions...

35:04.656 --> 35:07.022
I know... I know...
Best intentions in the worid.

35:07.091 --> 35:09.321
But I'm not suffering
from delayed stress,

35:09.394 --> 35:10.588
and I'm not <i>Looney Tunes.</i>

35:10.662 --> 35:12.755
Michelle is alive
and she's here in the Islands.

35:12.831 --> 35:13.957
Yeah, I know.

35:14.032 --> 35:14.964
What?

35:15.700 --> 35:16.632
We know.

35:16.701 --> 35:18.794
Orville and I went to your
place looking for you.

35:18.870 --> 35:20.633
Higgins showed us the blowup.

35:20.705 --> 35:22.639
Man,
is that little guy confused.

35:22.707 --> 35:25.198
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you just pull me all about.

35:25.276 --> 35:26.743
Rick, what the hell
are you doing?

35:26.811 --> 35:28.369
While you
were diddy-bopping,

35:28.446 --> 35:30.471
little Victor Charlie here
has been on your tail.

35:30.548 --> 35:31.674
What?

35:33.718 --> 35:34.980
Will you let him go?

35:35.053 --> 35:37.180
Yeah. He... he's right.
We spotted him a while back.

35:37.255 --> 35:39.485
You two gone nuts?
Come here.

35:39.557 --> 35:40.546
You okay, son?

35:42.827 --> 35:43.816
Will you speak English?

35:43.895 --> 35:45.123
Go ahead, son.
Take off.

35:51.069 --> 35:52.400
Why did you turn
that kid loose?

35:52.470 --> 35:53.767
Will you knock it off, Rick?

35:53.838 --> 35:55.601
Listen, Thomas,
he understands.

35:55.673 --> 35:57.732
Man, you forget real quick,
don't you?

35:57.809 --> 35:58.901
Hey, let's drop it.

35:58.977 --> 36:00.103
I don't believe you guys.

36:00.178 --> 36:01.270
You really take the cake.

36:01.346 --> 36:04.577
You come here looking for me, you roust
a kid, you damn near start a riot.

36:04.649 --> 36:07.345
This is Honolulu, and in case you
haven't heard, the war's over.

36:07.418 --> 36:09.181
Thomas, that kid was
sneakin' up on you.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.687
To do what? Frag me?

36:10.755 --> 36:11.847
No, but maybe...

36:11.923 --> 36:13.117
If that kid was following me,

36:13.191 --> 36:16.024
it was to hit me up
for an ice cream cone.

36:16.294 --> 36:18.694
Hey, man,
it's this part of town.

36:18.997 --> 36:21.056
It's enough to
make anybody paranoid.

36:21.132 --> 36:22.895
Well, I don't care.
That's no excuse.

36:22.967 --> 36:24.867
Okay, okay,
maybe you guys are right.

36:26.004 --> 36:28.472
I guess I thought I got all that
kind of stuff out of my head,

36:28.539 --> 36:30.473
but it's the smell
and the sound around here.

36:30.541 --> 36:32.566
And then seeing
that kid doggin' you,

36:32.644 --> 36:34.737
I guess I freaked out
for a couple of minutes.

36:34.812 --> 36:35.801
I'm sorry.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.904
No.

36:37.415 --> 36:39.849
I'm the one
who should apologize.

36:40.551 --> 36:42.348
It just came up
on you and bit you

36:42.420 --> 36:44.320
in the butt when
you weren't looking.

36:45.089 --> 36:48.183
You know, I forgot
what a pretty woman she was.

36:50.561 --> 36:52.028
Nothin', huh?

36:53.164 --> 36:54.256
Nope.

36:54.332 --> 36:56.425
Hey, you got any more
of those pictures, Thomas?

36:56.501 --> 36:57.490
Yeah.

36:57.635 --> 36:58.727
Well, fish 'em out.

36:58.803 --> 37:00.202
Three of us can
cover this village

37:00.271 --> 37:01.636
faster than one.

37:05.009 --> 37:06.135
What's wrong?

37:06.210 --> 37:08.701
That little turkey
stole my wallet.

37:11.149 --> 37:12.173
Back up.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.410
War's over, huh?

37:13.518 --> 37:16.078
At least they're not
wearing black pajamas.

37:19.657 --> 37:20.919
No cash.

37:23.294 --> 37:24.283
Oh, money.

37:24.362 --> 37:26.956
One, two, three...

37:27.365 --> 37:30.596
I knew that Ferrari
wasn't his.

37:48.086 --> 37:49.451
Who is she?

37:55.293 --> 37:56.692
A woman
I was hired to find.

37:56.761 --> 37:58.092
I'm a private investigator.

37:58.162 --> 37:59.288
I could have proved that

37:59.364 --> 38:01.195
if that kid
hadn't stolen my wallet.

38:01.265 --> 38:02.755
Who hired you?

38:03.034 --> 38:04.934
I can't tell you that.
It's confidential.

38:05.003 --> 38:06.402
Do you want your brains

38:06.471 --> 38:08.166
splattered all over
the sidewalk?

38:08.239 --> 38:09.365
He did.

38:09.941 --> 38:11.033
Thanks, pal.

38:11.109 --> 38:12.974
Why do you want
to find this woman?

38:13.044 --> 38:14.807
That's my business,
monkey breath.

38:14.879 --> 38:16.904
Good, good,
make friends with the man.

38:16.981 --> 38:18.812
Why don't you stick to
driving and cooking?

38:18.883 --> 38:19.907
Drivin' and cookin'?

38:19.984 --> 38:21.417
Shut up now!

38:21.686 --> 38:23.085
Why do you seek this woman?

38:23.154 --> 38:24.382
It's none of your business.

38:24.455 --> 38:27.447
Oh, come on, tell him. I don't
want my brains splattered all over

38:27.525 --> 38:30.187
just because
l... l... I only get $200 a day.

38:30.261 --> 38:32.627
$200? You pay him $200,
and you only pay me

38:32.697 --> 38:34.631
$25 a day,
the way I drive?

38:34.699 --> 38:35.757
The way you cook,

38:35.833 --> 38:37.266
you're lucky
you get paid at all.

38:37.335 --> 38:39.098
Why do you seek her?

38:40.271 --> 38:41.932
She was... she was
my girlfriend in Nam.

38:55.486 --> 38:57.147
What's so funny?
Nothin'.

38:57.221 --> 38:59.985
Don't tell me "nothin'."
You're laughing at somethin'.

39:00.058 --> 39:02.856
It's just that
I can't imagine a short turkey

39:02.927 --> 39:05.259
like you with a woman
like that.

39:15.773 --> 39:17.764
Let's see just
how hot you are

39:17.842 --> 39:19.673
without a piece, fuzzball.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.926
You all right?
Yeah.

39:36.794 --> 39:38.056
What did that guy
hit me with?

39:43.234 --> 39:44.633
You let them get away?

39:44.702 --> 39:46.192
Oh, what happened to yours?

39:47.071 --> 39:49.631
Oh, that crowd kind of
ran interference for him.

39:49.707 --> 39:52.369
Face it, T.C.,
you let him outrun you.

39:53.911 --> 39:55.401
I didn't let him do nothing.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.947
What's you guys' excuse?

39:57.014 --> 39:59.107
Rick's guy was bigger
than he was.

40:00.184 --> 40:01.947
Everybody's bigger
than he is.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.216
This look familiar?

40:04.856 --> 40:07.324
Yeah, it's
a Tokarev Star 9 mm.

40:07.892 --> 40:09.826
North Vietnamese
regulars carried it.

40:11.462 --> 40:13.487
<i>I hope you have</i>
<i>an uneventful flight</i>

40:13.564 --> 40:14.792
<i>back to Pearl Harbor.</i>

40:15.299 --> 40:16.493
Over here,

40:16.567 --> 40:18.592
the natives don't
shoot at us, General.

40:18.669 --> 40:20.296
At least not yet.

40:20.805 --> 40:22.739
You never slack off,
do you?

40:22.807 --> 40:25.571
Perhaps when
the negotiations are over.

40:26.077 --> 40:28.102
I look forward
to that.

40:29.580 --> 40:33.516
Madam Hue, again, thank you
for your gracious hospitality.

40:33.584 --> 40:35.882
The pleasure was ours,
Admiral.

40:43.060 --> 40:44.357
Who is this Magnum?

40:44.428 --> 40:47.056
I don't know.
Perhaps your wife does.

40:48.232 --> 40:50.063
He was looking for her
on the street

40:50.134 --> 40:52.227
they call "Little Saigon."

40:55.273 --> 40:57.104
Do you know this man?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.815
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

41:28.371 --> 41:30.430
<i>We spent the rest</i>
<i>of the day and night</i>

41:30.507 --> 41:32.372
<i>in Little Saigon,</i>
<i>striking out.</i>

41:32.475 --> 41:34.466
<i>No one knew Michelle,</i>
<i>the three yo-yos,</i>

41:34.544 --> 41:36.478
<i>or the kid</i>
<i>who stole my wallet.</i>

41:36.546 --> 41:39.947
<i>Or to be more accurate,</i>
<i>no one admitted knowing them.</i>

41:56.566 --> 41:59.262
<i>By the time I hit the rack,</i>
<i>it was nearly dawn.</i>

41:59.336 --> 42:00.667
<i>It ended up</i>

42:00.737 --> 42:02.227
<i>being my second night</i>
<i>without sleep</i>

42:02.305 --> 42:03.795
<i>and I knew there</i>
<i>would be a lot more</i>

42:03.873 --> 42:05.306
<i>until I found her.</i>

42:18.788 --> 42:20.016
Oh, no.

42:22.625 --> 42:23.853
Come on, guys.

42:24.594 --> 42:26.118
It was then

42:27.897 --> 42:29.330
I decided

42:30.567 --> 42:35.300
to switch from
lorries to camels.

42:36.773 --> 42:40.834
A decision that would
someday be credited

42:40.910 --> 42:42.775
as important as...

42:42.846 --> 42:44.040
Higgins!

42:45.348 --> 42:46.906
"A decision
that would some day

42:46.983 --> 42:49.076
be credited as
important as..."

42:49.886 --> 42:53.879
Churchill's decision

42:53.957 --> 42:56.858
to bomb Berlin.

42:58.228 --> 42:59.320
Yes, yes.

43:00.029 --> 43:01.121
Quite good.

43:02.899 --> 43:04.924
Higgins, call off the dogs!

43:05.001 --> 43:06.366
What Lawrence

43:06.436 --> 43:08.666
had accomplished
in the First Worid War,

43:08.738 --> 43:11.707
I was determined
to accomplish in the Second.

43:12.208 --> 43:13.971
It was no small deed

43:14.043 --> 43:16.273
to lead a company
of desert rats

43:16.346 --> 43:17.973
into that beastly hell.

43:18.047 --> 43:20.311
Higgins,
please call off the dogs!

43:23.153 --> 43:25.986
Good God, how is a man
supposed to write around here?

43:26.055 --> 43:27.079
Yes?

43:27.157 --> 43:28.215
<i>Magnum in?</i>

43:28.324 --> 43:30.349
He's exercising the dogs.

43:34.497 --> 43:36.488
I told you he's occupied.

43:36.766 --> 43:38.256
<i>Well, he'll have to</i>
<i>get unoccupied.</i>

43:38.334 --> 43:39.892
<i>I have a personal message</i>
<i>for him</i>

43:39.969 --> 43:42.028
<i>from the President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

43:50.280 --> 43:51.372
This is a joke.

43:51.448 --> 43:52.608
I'm afraid not.

43:52.682 --> 43:53.740
They can't do this to me.

43:53.817 --> 43:54.943
I resigned my commission.

43:55.018 --> 43:57.179
Well, the President
just un-resigned it.

43:57.253 --> 43:59.619
Well, Mac, I thought we fought
a war against the British

43:59.689 --> 44:01.054
over impressment.

44:01.124 --> 44:03.092
Yeah, we did.
That was the War of 1812.

44:03.159 --> 44:04.683
That's funny, isn't it?

44:04.761 --> 44:06.126
No, it's not funny.

44:06.196 --> 44:07.891
The Navy can't
just pop into my life

44:07.964 --> 44:09.454
and say, "Anchors Aweigh."

44:09.532 --> 44:11.022
Well, we just did.

44:12.335 --> 44:13.393
Why?

44:14.270 --> 44:15.396
I don't know.

44:15.672 --> 44:16.730
Mac!

44:19.342 --> 44:20.741
Okay. I can't lie to you,

44:20.810 --> 44:22.437
even though
l... I have every right to,

44:22.512 --> 44:24.878
the way you con
and hoodwink me.

44:26.349 --> 44:28.442
It's got something to do with
the DOD investigation

44:28.518 --> 44:30.509
into your unit in Nam.

44:30.587 --> 44:33.488
Uh, they want you
back to Washington to testify.

44:34.557 --> 44:36.218
What, in uniform?

44:36.292 --> 44:38.624
Would you go
if they just asked?

44:39.929 --> 44:41.920
Who had these orders cut?

44:42.098 --> 44:43.622
Well, it says the President.

44:43.700 --> 44:45.395
Come on, Mac,
you know what I mean.

44:45.468 --> 44:47.129
Who requested
I be reactivated?

44:47.303 --> 44:48.395
Col. Greene.

44:48.605 --> 44:49.731
Buck Greene?

44:50.640 --> 44:52.699
Yeah, that's his nickname.
Uh, you know him?

44:52.775 --> 44:53.799
Yeah, Mac.

44:53.877 --> 44:56.368
We served together
in Nam on my last tour.

44:56.446 --> 44:58.914
He was the Marine S-2 Officer
attached to our TOC.

44:58.982 --> 45:00.210
Very gung ho.

45:02.252 --> 45:04.083
Is he stationed here?

45:04.454 --> 45:06.183
Yeah.
But... but you're not.

45:06.256 --> 45:08.281
I've got to get you on
a C-141 in the morning

45:08.358 --> 45:10.019
for Washington at 0600.

45:10.093 --> 45:11.583
I am not going.
No way.

45:11.661 --> 45:14.960
Thomas, don't make me
do this the hard way.

45:17.066 --> 45:18.658
The hard way?

45:18.868 --> 45:21.632
I've got two marine MPs
out by the gate.

45:22.705 --> 45:25.674
Maybe you can get by them,
but you're gonna be AWOL.

45:25.742 --> 45:27.869
There's not a court in the
land that would convict me.

45:27.944 --> 45:29.172
Maybe not a civil court,

45:29.245 --> 45:30.610
but you're in
the military now.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.739
And l... I know a lot of
brass who would just love

45:32.815 --> 45:34.874
to see you in
a brig at Norfolk.

45:38.721 --> 45:40.313
Well, look at
the bright side of this,

45:40.390 --> 45:41.482
there's a positive side.

45:41.558 --> 45:43.617
The... the Navy will release
you from active duty

45:43.693 --> 45:45.183
just as soon as you testify.

45:45.261 --> 45:48.355
And Washington's beautiful
this time of year, uh,

45:48.932 --> 45:50.627
and filled with
lovely ladies,

45:50.700 --> 45:52.725
just especially
for a Navy Commander.

45:57.206 --> 45:58.673
I was a Lieutenant.

45:58.741 --> 46:00.208
Well, not anymore.

46:00.276 --> 46:01.766
The President
just promoted you

46:01.844 --> 46:04.438
to full Commander, sir.

46:06.182 --> 46:08.082
And they give
the condemned man

46:08.151 --> 46:09.914
a terrific last meal, too.

47:09.245 --> 47:11.236
With this ring, I thee wed.

47:11.314 --> 47:13.612
Then, under the eyes of God,

47:14.017 --> 47:16.542
and by the powers
vested in me

47:16.986 --> 47:20.149
by the Holy
Roman Catholic Church,

47:20.390 --> 47:24.053
I pronounce you
man and wife.

48:29.692 --> 48:32.160
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

48:32.228 --> 48:35.288
My last confession
was April 29, 1975.

48:38.201 --> 48:39.930
It's me, Michelle.

48:41.037 --> 48:43.369
Thomas knows
I'm alive and here.

48:43.473 --> 48:46.169
He was looking for me
in Little Saigon.

48:46.275 --> 48:49.836
Someone stole his wallet
and delivered it to Col. Ki.

48:51.214 --> 48:53.739
I was afraid of
something like this.

48:54.417 --> 48:56.351
At least he's
taken care of now

48:56.486 --> 48:58.454
until the negotiations
are over.

48:58.688 --> 48:59.780
How?

49:00.056 --> 49:02.490
Don't worry.
Nothing with prejudice.

49:05.394 --> 49:06.691
I want to see him.

49:07.130 --> 49:08.222
Impossible.

49:08.297 --> 49:09.662
Arrange it.

49:11.968 --> 49:14.232
I am not going to risk
your being discovered

49:14.303 --> 49:16.635
just so you can
see an old lover.

49:20.943 --> 49:22.672
He was my husband,

49:22.745 --> 49:24.679
and if you want me
to continue,

49:24.747 --> 49:27.375
set up the meeting.
Do you understand?

49:30.286 --> 49:31.412
When?

49:33.322 --> 49:35.483
Tonight, after novena. Here.

49:37.493 --> 49:38.482
I'll try.

49:38.561 --> 49:39.619
I would do more...

49:42.031 --> 49:44.556
I would do more
than try, Father.

49:53.676 --> 49:54.768
Damn.

50:57.139 --> 50:59.334
<i>When Mac served me</i>
<i>with the Presidential order,</i>

50:59.408 --> 51:00.875
<i>my first thought</i>
<i>was to rabbit.</i>

51:00.943 --> 51:02.137
<i>Then I realized</i>

51:02.211 --> 51:04.270
<i>the Navy was giving me</i>
<i>a wonderful opportunity.</i>

51:04.347 --> 51:06.542
<i>And I don't mean Buck</i>
<i>Greene's trip to Washington.</i>

51:06.616 --> 51:08.243
<i>That was a smoke screen.</i>

51:08.317 --> 51:10.182
<i>He wanted to get</i>
<i>rid of me for a while,</i>

51:10.253 --> 51:13.245
<i>and it had to have something</i>
<i>to do with Michelle.</i>

51:13.823 --> 51:15.313
<i>What, I didn't know,</i>

51:15.391 --> 51:17.120
<i>but I had a feeling</i>
<i>the answer would be</i>

51:17.193 --> 51:19.354
<i>in the Naval Intelligence</i>
<i>computer here at Pearl.</i>

51:19.462 --> 51:21.521
<i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was get access to it.</i>

51:21.597 --> 51:23.326
<i>Any party crasher</i>
<i>will tell you</i>

51:23.399 --> 51:25.697
<i>the key to getting in</i>
<i>when you don't belong,</i>

51:25.768 --> 51:27.360
<i>is to look like you do.</i>

51:27.436 --> 51:28.926
<i>And the Navy</i>
<i>had been kind enough</i>

51:29.005 --> 51:30.905
<i>to put me on</i>
<i>the base in uniform.</i>

51:30.973 --> 51:33.237
<i>I figured I could bluff</i>
<i>my way through the rest.</i>

51:33.309 --> 51:34.435
Yes, sir, Commander?

51:34.510 --> 51:36.171
MacReynolds.
Cryptic section.

51:36.545 --> 51:38.137
You're new here
aren't you, son?

51:38.214 --> 51:40.375
No, sir. Been pulling duty
here for about six months.

51:40.449 --> 51:42.280
Sir, may I see
that ID again, please?

51:42.351 --> 51:44.615
Do you always get
ketchup on your blouse, son?

51:44.687 --> 51:46.951
Uh, no, sir. Sorry, sir.
I must have done that at chow.

51:47.023 --> 51:49.491
Well, I didn't think you did
it at morning calisthenics.

51:49.558 --> 51:51.458
You do fall out
for calisthenics, don't you?

51:51.527 --> 51:53.688
Uh, no, sir. Seamen on
dogwatch aren't required to.

51:53.763 --> 51:56.755
Well, I know one who will if I see
spots like that on his uniform again.

51:56.832 --> 51:59.062
Yes, sir.
Sir, that ID again, please.

51:59.435 --> 52:00.766
Oh, of course.

52:01.904 --> 52:03.667
That's very good,
Corporal.

52:03.739 --> 52:06.207
Now that's the way
a trouser crease should look.

52:06.275 --> 52:07.867
Although you could use

52:07.944 --> 52:09.536
a little more spit
on that shoe shine.

52:09.612 --> 52:10.738
Aye, aye, sir.

52:10.813 --> 52:12.747
Sir.
What is it?

52:12.815 --> 52:15.340
The Seaman asked
to see that ID card.

52:16.719 --> 52:18.584
But he already saw it.

52:18.654 --> 52:20.952
Yes, sir, but not close enough
to let you through security

52:21.023 --> 52:23.992
and certainly not till I check it
through the personnel computer.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.025
Computer? Right. Of course.

52:26.095 --> 52:28.689
L... I forgot some papers
in my car.

52:28.764 --> 52:31.892
Tell you what. I expect to be
cleared by the time I come back.

52:32.768 --> 52:34.463
Sir! Halt, please!

53:03.766 --> 53:06.234
Hey, Mac.
Couldn't sleep, huh?

53:06.302 --> 53:08.429
I know I get the same feeling
when I've eaten too much.

53:08.504 --> 53:09.596
Magnum, shut up.

53:09.672 --> 53:10.798
Hey, come on, Mac...

53:10.873 --> 53:12.864
I don't wanna hear another
word out of you, Magnum!

53:12.942 --> 53:14.273
Not one word.

53:14.343 --> 53:16.777
Gi-give me my name tag.
What happened?

53:16.846 --> 53:18.006
He had your ID, sir.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.480
Tried to use it to bluff
his way through security.

53:20.549 --> 53:22.312
I just wanted to
see my old office.

53:22.385 --> 53:24.114
If he says another word,
gag him.

53:24.186 --> 53:26.017
Come on, Mac.
What are you so hot about?

53:26.088 --> 53:28.522
I'm responsible for you until
you catch your flight tomorrow

53:28.591 --> 53:31.059
and I have no intentions
of giving Col. Greene

53:31.127 --> 53:33.493
any excuse to ship me
to Guam for a year.

53:33.562 --> 53:35.723
I wouldn't do that
to you, Mac.

53:35.798 --> 53:37.129
Attention.

53:49.912 --> 53:51.174
At ease.

53:52.048 --> 53:54.141
Magnum.
Been a while.

53:55.384 --> 53:57.079
Yeah, a few years.

53:58.554 --> 54:00.613
How's it feel
to be back on active duty?

54:00.689 --> 54:02.020
Confining.

54:02.892 --> 54:04.655
You wanna tell me
what you're after here?

54:04.727 --> 54:06.456
Oh, it's a nostalgic tour.

54:06.529 --> 54:07.826
I heard the Navy
had preserved

54:07.897 --> 54:09.956
my old office
exactly the way I left it.

54:12.101 --> 54:14.035
I'll sign that release.

54:19.442 --> 54:20.875
Well done.

54:21.243 --> 54:22.835
Step over here.

54:27.917 --> 54:29.782
I'm not getting on
that flight, Buck.

54:29.852 --> 54:32.047
Magnum...
You stay out of this, Mac.

54:32.788 --> 54:35.484
I don't know how,
I don't know why,

54:35.825 --> 54:37.884
but Michelle's alive,
and she's here,

54:38.027 --> 54:40.086
and you're mixed up in it.
You're the key.

54:40.162 --> 54:41.595
Now I'm gonna find her.

54:41.664 --> 54:43.689
And I don't care
if I have to blow the lid off

54:43.766 --> 54:45.165
whatever operation
you're running,

54:45.234 --> 54:46.496
and no matter who it hurts.

54:46.569 --> 54:48.002
And I mean it.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.330
You think he means it, Mac?

54:53.676 --> 54:55.268
Yes, sir, I do.

54:59.582 --> 55:01.516
Then we'd better take him
to Michelle.

55:20.436 --> 55:22.700
Don't you ever knock,
Colonel?

55:32.414 --> 55:34.041
Yes? What is it?

55:34.950 --> 55:37.748
The man who was seeking
your wife in Little Saigon.

55:38.053 --> 55:39.042
Magnum.

55:39.855 --> 55:40.981
Yes?

55:42.491 --> 55:43.753
I have learned that

55:43.826 --> 55:45.453
he and your wife
were lovers.

55:49.231 --> 55:52.257
There is even a possibility
they were married.

55:57.873 --> 56:00.933
Then that would explain

56:01.143 --> 56:03.270
why he was looking for her,
wouldn't it?

56:05.247 --> 56:06.509
Perhaps.

56:07.816 --> 56:09.477
Damn it, Colonel!

56:10.753 --> 56:13.813
If you have something to say,
say it.

56:15.558 --> 56:17.685
This Magnum was
a Naval Intelligence Officer

56:17.760 --> 56:19.352
who fought against us.

56:19.428 --> 56:22.022
A key member of one
of their assassination teams.

56:22.231 --> 56:23.892
He left their navy
two years ago

56:23.966 --> 56:25.866
to become
a private investigator.

56:26.335 --> 56:28.860
I believe he is
a member of the CIA.

56:30.005 --> 56:31.597
Go on, Colonel.

56:32.341 --> 56:33.933
There is a possibility

56:34.143 --> 56:37.635
that The Tiger we seek
is a Tigress.

56:38.013 --> 56:41.244
That is Madam Hue,
and her contact is Magnum.

56:49.091 --> 56:52.527
Which is it, Colonel?
Lover or spy?

56:53.395 --> 56:54.987
I believe both.

56:58.167 --> 57:02.001
Then why would this Magnum
be searching for her?

57:04.373 --> 57:06.432
If he's her CIA contact,

57:06.508 --> 57:08.635
he'd certainly know
how to reach her!

57:10.412 --> 57:11.743
I feel I must interrogate

57:11.814 --> 57:13.873
Madam Hue and Magnum
to answer that.

57:13.949 --> 57:16.247
You're looking
for scapegoats!

57:16.785 --> 57:18.810
You're running out of time

57:18.921 --> 57:22.118
and you have no
idea who The Tiger is,

57:22.258 --> 57:23.782
where The Tiger is!

57:26.528 --> 57:28.553
So, you are trying
to involve my wife

57:28.631 --> 57:30.292
because she is French

57:30.733 --> 57:33.224
and was a nurse
in South Vietnam.

57:33.302 --> 57:35.293
With all due respect,
General Hue,

57:35.371 --> 57:36.838
I have my own authority.

57:36.905 --> 57:38.873
I came here to
tell you this out of courtesy,

57:38.941 --> 57:40.033
not necessity.

57:40.109 --> 57:44.341
You came out of hate
and petty jealousy.

57:53.689 --> 57:55.554
You forget, General,

57:55.791 --> 57:57.554
that this mission
of yours

57:57.626 --> 57:59.821
is simply to provide me time
to find The Tiger.

58:00.663 --> 58:02.927
And when I find him, or her,

58:03.866 --> 58:05.595
to execute whoever it is

58:05.734 --> 58:07.702
in as public a manner
as possible.

58:16.545 --> 58:21.141
As you say,
you have your own authority.

58:22.918 --> 58:25.409
But if you are wrong...

58:27.656 --> 58:29.419
I give you my word,

58:29.491 --> 58:31.755
every precaution will be taken

58:31.894 --> 58:34.158
not to permanently
harm Madam Hue.

58:34.863 --> 58:36.330
She is quite beautiful...

58:36.398 --> 58:38.093
Do not say any more, Colonel.

58:40.135 --> 58:42.831
Not one word more!

58:54.083 --> 58:56.381
She never did tell you
she was married

58:56.452 --> 58:57.942
to a North Vietnamese officer?

58:58.020 --> 58:59.112
Of course she did.

58:59.188 --> 59:00.416
She also told me

59:00.489 --> 59:02.514
he'd been killed
in the Tet Offensive.

59:03.025 --> 59:04.356
That's what she thought.

59:05.527 --> 59:07.188
The week we were
pulling out of Saigon,

59:07.262 --> 59:09.355
she found out he was alive.

59:12.801 --> 59:14.894
Why the hell
didn't she tell me?

59:14.970 --> 59:16.733
She was afraid to.

59:17.706 --> 59:19.298
Afraid you wouldn't leave.

59:19.375 --> 59:21.104
Damn right.
Not without her.

59:23.545 --> 59:26.241
Michelle's a very
devout Catholic, Tom.

59:27.416 --> 59:28.883
As far as she's concerned,

59:28.951 --> 59:30.782
her marriage to you
wasn't legal,

59:30.853 --> 59:33.378
especially in
the eyes of the Church.

59:33.489 --> 59:34.581
So you set it up

59:34.656 --> 59:36.123
to look like
she'd been killed.

59:36.191 --> 59:38.352
I had to.
She begged me to.

59:38.527 --> 59:40.791
It was the only way she
could get you to leave Nam.

59:40.896 --> 59:42.989
In exchange for what,
Buck?

59:44.066 --> 59:45.294
Little Saigon.

59:59.581 --> 01:00:01.048
You didn't answer me.

01:00:01.116 --> 01:00:03.107
She's been my contact
in Saigon.

01:00:03.519 --> 01:00:04.713
You bastard.

01:00:04.787 --> 01:00:06.084
You know better than that.

01:00:06.455 --> 01:00:09.219
She's married to
a high-ranking NVA officer.

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:11.191
Of course I asked her
to be a contact!

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.319
It wasn't any precondition
to helping her.

01:00:13.462 --> 01:00:15.521
If she'd have said no,
I'd have still done it.

01:00:15.597 --> 01:00:16.962
You had a gun to her head!

01:00:17.032 --> 01:00:19.125
You're involved emotionally
in the situation.

01:00:19.201 --> 01:00:20.532
And it's clouding
your judgment.

01:00:20.602 --> 01:00:23.036
If it was me instead of you,
you'd have done the same thing.

01:00:23.105 --> 01:00:24.800
No. No, I wouldn't.

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:26.534
I'd never use
anybody as vulnerable

01:00:26.608 --> 01:00:28.269
as she was
for a little information.

01:00:28.343 --> 01:00:30.868
We'd lost the war, Buck.
It was over.

01:00:30.946 --> 01:00:32.675
That war's never over.

01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:36.211
Uh, Thomas, the chapel is
at the end of the street.

01:00:36.285 --> 01:00:38.276
She'll be praying
to the Virgin Mother.

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:41.546
Colonel, are you gonna
let him go, just like that?

01:00:41.623 --> 01:00:43.614
I know Magnum.
He's gonna run with her.

01:00:44.793 --> 01:00:46.021
You can't
run with someone

01:00:46.094 --> 01:00:47.857
unless they want
to run with you, Mac.

01:00:48.864 --> 01:00:51.196
Michelle may be in love
with Magnum.

01:00:51.266 --> 01:00:53.791
But Madam Hue
will never leave her husband.

01:02:10.712 --> 01:02:12.407
You sure you don't
want any of this?

01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:13.641
I wouldn't touch it in Nam.

01:02:13.715 --> 01:02:14.875
I'm not gonna start now.

01:02:14.983 --> 01:02:17.042
I don't know why not.
It's delicious.

01:02:17.152 --> 01:02:20.815
Over there it was
mostly dog, or cat, or rat.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:24.254
Of course, I'm sure
it's different here.

01:02:45.981 --> 01:02:48.040
Col. Ki is on his way.

01:02:49.184 --> 01:02:50.742
To the church?

01:02:51.186 --> 01:02:53.814
Yes. He hopes to find
Madam Hue with Magnum.

01:02:53.889 --> 01:02:55.379
Ki knows Magnum's here?

01:02:55.457 --> 01:02:57.357
No. He only suspects
she's with him.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.621
He believes
Magnum is CIA.

01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:02.191
We gotta get them
out of there.

01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:03.253
Maybe not.

01:03:03.332 --> 01:03:05.664
But if he catches them
in there together...

01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:08.435
He may think
he's made The Tiger.

01:03:08.837 --> 01:03:10.862
Michelle's not The Tiger.

01:03:11.506 --> 01:03:14.339
Colonel, you can't do this.
It isn't right.

01:03:14.409 --> 01:03:15.501
That's one way

01:03:15.577 --> 01:03:17.067
Magnum and Michelle
can be together.

01:03:17.145 --> 01:03:18.203
If they escape.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.713
But that's not
why you're doin' it.

01:03:19.781 --> 01:03:21.976
You're... you're trying to
throw Ki off The Tiger's trail.

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.813
Keep your voice down,
Lieutenant.

01:03:23.885 --> 01:03:25.750
Would Magnum want
this chance or not?

01:03:26.221 --> 01:03:28.052
Yeah, but...
No buts.

01:03:28.857 --> 01:03:31.758
If it works,
it works for all of us.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.411
Our marriage was not valid

01:03:56.485 --> 01:03:58.976
in the eyes of
the law or the Church.

01:03:59.054 --> 01:04:00.885
And what of our love?

01:04:03.225 --> 01:04:05.955
I loved Hue,
and he is my husband.

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.158
Do you love him
as much as you love me?

01:04:18.707 --> 01:04:20.072
Michelle,

01:04:23.111 --> 01:04:24.601
what we had,

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:28.779
what we still have

01:04:30.052 --> 01:04:32.247
is something
that happens maybe

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.481
once in a lifetime.
Don't throw it away.

01:04:36.525 --> 01:04:38.356
There are laws
that supersede love.

01:04:38.427 --> 01:04:39.758
What, laws of the Church?

01:04:39.828 --> 01:04:41.227
No. Laws of God.

01:04:41.463 --> 01:04:43.897
The Church is
only His instrument.

01:04:44.933 --> 01:04:46.127
Thomas.

01:04:47.369 --> 01:04:49.997
There are things
one must cling to,

01:04:50.238 --> 01:04:52.297
to survive.

01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:54.532
My faith is one of those.

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.402
It has sustained me
through a lifetime of war.

01:05:02.317 --> 01:05:05.218
I have seen
everyone and everything

01:05:05.287 --> 01:05:07.983
I have ever loved destroyed.

01:05:08.623 --> 01:05:11.217
I have survived
because of my faith.

01:05:11.593 --> 01:05:13.925
Don't ask me to throw it
aside now.

01:05:13.995 --> 01:05:16.623
Why are you saying
all this to me now?

01:05:20.235 --> 01:05:21.827
Why didn't you
tell me this in Saigon

01:05:21.903 --> 01:05:22.927
when he was...

01:05:23.004 --> 01:05:25.131
When you found out
he was alive?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.566
Why did you lie,

01:05:26.641 --> 01:05:28.472
and why did you let me
think you were dead?

01:05:28.543 --> 01:05:30.477
Because...
Go through the pain.

01:05:30.545 --> 01:05:31.603
Because I knew

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.944
you would never leave
Vietnam without me.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.149
Thomas, I couldn't stand

01:05:36.218 --> 01:05:39.381
the thought of
seeing you captured

01:05:39.454 --> 01:05:41.479
or destroyed,
used as a pawn,

01:05:41.556 --> 01:05:43.421
traded for
a shipment of rice.

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.493
You would never
have left Vietnam

01:05:46.561 --> 01:05:48.358
without me, would you?

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:49.522
No.

01:05:54.936 --> 01:05:56.801
Just tell me something.

01:05:58.173 --> 01:06:00.198
Why are you seeing me now?

01:06:01.777 --> 01:06:03.574
Why open up my guts
and have me bleeding

01:06:03.645 --> 01:06:04.634
all over the floor?

01:06:10.218 --> 01:06:11.981
Because I love you.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.549
Thomas.

01:06:33.308 --> 01:06:36.277
I love you more than
anything in this worid.

01:08:34.912 --> 01:08:37.176
I didn't know
you were Catholic, Colonel.

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.841
And I didn't know
you were so devout.

01:08:40.017 --> 01:08:43.009
Prayers this afternoon
and tonight, too.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:47.720
Or do you come here
to confess your sins?

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.191
Good night, Colonel.
One moment.

01:08:58.268 --> 01:08:59.564
How dare you.

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:12.337
Where is he?

01:09:24.962 --> 01:09:27.453
Unless you want
Madam Hue shot,

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.959
follow me. Now!

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:35.300
Don't do it, Thomas.

01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:42.742
All the way, please.

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:08.630
My husband will have
your head for this, Colonel.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.503
Madam, your husband
knows all about this.

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.017
Let's go.

01:10:33.297 --> 01:10:34.355
No!

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:19.135
Who's this Tiger?

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.407
What do you know
of The Tiger?

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:24.413
Oh, those NVA types

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.176
who jumped us
in Little Saigon,

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:29.150
they said something in Vietnamese
about being after The Tiger.

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:30.811
Who is he?

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.219
He heads the new
revolutionary front.

01:11:33.924 --> 01:11:35.118
What? Say it again.

01:11:35.192 --> 01:11:36.784
I don't think
I heard you right.

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.225
Yes, you did.

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:41.393
It is starting again?

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:43.098
Well, there are many
from the North

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:44.758
who are as disillusioned

01:11:44.835 --> 01:11:47.167
with the reunification
and party leadership

01:11:47.237 --> 01:11:49.262
as those in the South.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:52.433
The most effective of these
is called The Tiger.

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:55.976
He says the party has
betrayed the people,

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:57.707
has sold out to Moscow.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.210
Does that include
your husband?

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:02.444
Yes.

01:12:02.853 --> 01:12:04.081
That is why he insisted

01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:06.384
upon having
the MIA negotiations

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.788
here in Hawaii
instead of Hanoi.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.257
He and Col. Ki knew

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:11.954
that The Tiger
would be here this month

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:14.258
to organize
the refugee community

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:17.164
and to negotiate
for aid from your CIA.

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.927
The Tiger would trust us?

01:12:21.972 --> 01:12:25.032
No. But he would
take aid from anybody.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:26.666
The Chinese, the Americans.

01:12:26.743 --> 01:12:28.335
Anyone but the Russians.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:39.218
Do you know who he is?

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.183
No. Why would I?

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.691
Buck Greene admitted to me
that you work for him.

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:51.597
Is that why Col. Ki
came after you?

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:53.933
I don't know.

01:12:56.273 --> 01:12:58.036
Thomas, please, no.

01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:01.771
Thomas.

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:03.804
No, please.

01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:17.826
It's like
we've never been apart.

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:21.387
As if those six years
didn't exist.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.264
But they do.
No.

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:29.736
Not at this moment,
they don't.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.147
Thomas, no.

01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:08.700
One moment,
please, General.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.536
I realize
she is your wife.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.479
She's also an enemy
of the people.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.409
Do not allow
your feelings for her

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.279
to destroy you, too.

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:25.777
Do not tell me my duty.

01:15:38.435 --> 01:15:39.561
Michelle.

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.062
Hue.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:44.463
Where are you?

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:50.007
It doesn't matter.
Can I speak?

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:52.973
Yes.

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:55.911
What is going on?

01:15:56.186 --> 01:15:57.619
Last night, Col. Ki

01:15:57.687 --> 01:16:00.121
came to the church
looking for me.

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:02.556
He said you
knew he was there

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:06.387
and... and that I should
go with him. Why?

01:16:07.464 --> 01:16:10.729
He believes that
you are The Tiger.

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:16.697
Oh, Col. Ki is a fool.

01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:19.837
Yeah. On that we agree.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:23.743
Oh, Hue.

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:29.846
What am I to do?

01:16:32.389 --> 01:16:34.084
I am your husband.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.854
I will protect you.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:41.728
I am afraid
even to believe you.

01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:46.366
I love you, Michelle.

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:55.238
There is so much
that you don't know.

01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:58.574
I know of your marriage
to the American.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:01.610
What?

01:17:01.885 --> 01:17:03.682
You thought I was dead.

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:05.818
It is understandable.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.090
Meet me, Michelle.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:14.128
To talk,

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.292
to work this out.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:40.547
Michelle.

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:52.396
Michelle.

01:18:08.418 --> 01:18:10.750
<i>There are times you know</i>
<i>the worst has happened</i>

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.447
<i>without</i>
<i>anyone telling you.</i>

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.955
<i>My heart was racing,</i>

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.583
<i>my palms were</i>
<i>beginning to sweat.</i>

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:19.093
<i>I knew my nightmare</i>
<i>was beginning again.</i>

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:22.359
<i>Only this time,</i>
<i>I was wide awake.</i>

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:03.732
<i>Thomas, darling,</i>

01:19:03.807 --> 01:19:05.900
<i>some people have</i>
<i>a lifetime to love.</i>

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:07.340
<i>You and I seem</i>
<i>destined to have</i>

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.241
<i>but a few moments.</i>

01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:10.939
<i>Yet I know no one</i>
<i>on God's earth</i>

01:19:11.014 --> 01:19:13.574
<i>can love more than we have.</i>

01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:15.345
<i>I do what I must.</i>

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.511
<i>To do otherwise would</i>
<i>destroy not only me,</i>

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:19.714
<i>but eventually our love.</i>

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:22.053
<i>Please try to understand that.</i>

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:23.887
<i>And know</i>
<i>that I have loved you</i>

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.825
<i>since the first day</i>
<i>I saw you.</i>

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:27.487
<i>I will continue to love you</i>

01:19:27.564 --> 01:19:30.226
<i>until the last day</i>
<i>of my life, and beyond.</i>

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.832
<i>Your wife, Michelle.</i>

01:19:55.628 --> 01:19:56.720
Higgins.

01:19:59.177 --> 01:20:00.166
Magnum.

01:20:00.545 --> 01:20:03.343
I don't want to hear one word from you,
not one bloody word.

01:20:03.415 --> 01:20:05.940
It's been quite a few years since
I retired from the regiment.

01:20:06.017 --> 01:20:08.781
True I may have put on a stone or two,
but that's to be expected

01:20:08.853 --> 01:20:11.822
when one leaves the rigors of
Army life for a civilian position.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.755
Higgins, l... I think you're
in amazing shape

01:20:13.825 --> 01:20:14.849
for a man your age.

01:20:14.926 --> 01:20:16.484
For a man my age?

01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:19.928
Sorry. Uh, I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.729
Higgins,
I need your help.

01:20:24.803 --> 01:20:26.737
Magnum, you always
need my help.

01:20:26.805 --> 01:20:28.898
Or something of mine,
or Mr. Masters'...

01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:34.511
You look bloody awful.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:36.877
Are you all right?

01:20:37.449 --> 01:20:38.939
No, but that doesn't matter.

01:20:39.017 --> 01:20:40.882
I need your help
to find my wife.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:43.076
Higgins.

01:20:44.322 --> 01:20:45.914
I thought you said
you needed help

01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:46.980
to find your wife.

01:20:47.859 --> 01:20:50.419
I did. She... she was
here last night

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:52.127
and now she's gone.

01:20:52.197 --> 01:20:54.165
I think she went back
to her husband.

01:20:55.533 --> 01:20:56.830
Oh, wait, wait,
I gotta explain.

01:20:56.901 --> 01:20:58.061
That doesn't make any sense.

01:20:58.136 --> 01:21:00.104
See, technically,
she's not my wife,

01:21:00.171 --> 01:21:02.071
because he wasn't dead
when we were married.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.836
Then when I found
out that she was...

01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:07.378
This sounds crazy even to me.

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:08.434
Magnum.

01:21:08.513 --> 01:21:10.777
I'm not crazy, Higgins.

01:21:10.849 --> 01:21:12.009
Look, the photo.

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:14.608
Uh, where's that blowup
that you and I made?

01:21:19.858 --> 01:21:21.348
Now, this woman,

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.620
the one on the boat,
she's my wife.

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.935
Okay, you showed these photos
to T.C. And Rick.

01:21:32.003 --> 01:21:33.630
What did they do?

01:21:34.072 --> 01:21:36.370
They ran out
acting marmalades.

01:21:36.441 --> 01:21:37.738
That's because

01:21:37.809 --> 01:21:39.902
they knew my wife
always wore this cross.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.536
It's the same cross
as our team ring,

01:21:41.613 --> 01:21:43.376
and they realized
she was alive.

01:21:43.715 --> 01:21:47.116
Higgins, look, I promise I'll
explain it all to you later.

01:21:47.185 --> 01:21:48.584
Right now, I just need
your help,

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:50.382
no questions asked.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.849
Right.
What do you want me to do?

01:22:23.054 --> 01:22:24.681
Keep an eye on me.

01:22:24.756 --> 01:22:26.747
If I get in trouble,
I'll tug on my ear.

01:22:26.825 --> 01:22:28.417
Got you.

01:23:11.035 --> 01:23:12.468
Oh, no.

01:23:14.272 --> 01:23:15.432
Oh, yes.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:28.886
Pardon me.

01:23:28.987 --> 01:23:29.976
Can you tell me

01:23:30.054 --> 01:23:32.818
if Col. Greene
ever commanded this vessel?

01:23:32.891 --> 01:23:34.017
No.

01:23:34.559 --> 01:23:35.583
But I believe

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.753
she had a navigator
by that name.

01:23:46.704 --> 01:23:48.934
Thank you for coming,
Captain.

01:23:49.908 --> 01:23:51.808
When did The Tiger
approach you people?

01:23:51.876 --> 01:23:53.810
Less than 48 hours ago.

01:23:53.978 --> 01:23:56.572
Quite frankly, we didn't know
whether he was legitimate

01:23:56.648 --> 01:24:00.209
or just some bloody refugee
trying to pull another scam.

01:24:00.385 --> 01:24:02.751
How did you know
to contact me?

01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:04.988
He told me.

01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:09.354
You can
stop signaling, Buck.

01:24:09.427 --> 01:24:11.019
I've got MacReynolds.

01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:13.157
Thank you, Higgins.

01:24:13.231 --> 01:24:14.528
Any time, old boy.

01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:18.391
Come here.

01:24:26.211 --> 01:24:28.406
I always said
you were good.

01:24:31.449 --> 01:24:33.007
Turn around.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:39.251
A little too sentimental,
perhaps, but good.

01:24:39.357 --> 01:24:41.257
Last night,
I've got pretty well figured out.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.418
You provided the cover fire

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:45.054
so Col. Ki could see
Michelle with me.

01:24:45.129 --> 01:24:46.960
You want him to think
she's an agent,

01:24:47.031 --> 01:24:48.362
maybe The Tiger.

01:24:48.433 --> 01:24:49.866
What do you know
about The Tiger?

01:24:49.934 --> 01:24:51.595
Not much.
But you're gonna brief me.

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:52.829
I can't do that, Tom.

01:24:52.904 --> 01:24:54.997
Oh, shucks, Buck.
Why not?

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.502
Rules are rules.

01:24:56.574 --> 01:24:57.632
Yeah.

01:24:57.809 --> 01:25:00.437
"An eye for an eye"
is my favorite one.

01:25:01.746 --> 01:25:03.771
I think Michelle is gonna die
because of you.

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:04.837
What do you think?

01:25:07.886 --> 01:25:09.376
You're right.

01:25:10.121 --> 01:25:11.713
Col. Ki believes
she is The Tiger.

01:25:11.789 --> 01:25:13.347
And I want him
to think that.

01:25:13.424 --> 01:25:15.551
At least until
the real Tiger

01:25:15.627 --> 01:25:17.595
can finish his work here
and return to Nam.

01:25:17.662 --> 01:25:19.095
Which is?

01:25:19.163 --> 01:25:21.131
Set up a network of refugees,

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:24.093
gather support,
arrange funding,

01:25:24.502 --> 01:25:27.027
weapons,
form a political base.

01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:31.133
Oh, come on, Buck,

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.177
you're not gonna dance
to that fiddler again.

01:25:33.244 --> 01:25:34.643
Well, that's not
for me to say.

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:35.906
But in the meantime,

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.572
we're trying
all the channels we can

01:25:37.649 --> 01:25:40.243
to do whatever we can to get
the bodies of our boys back.

01:25:40.318 --> 01:25:41.808
Where's Michelle?

01:25:41.953 --> 01:25:43.443
Waiting to join her husband.

01:25:43.988 --> 01:25:45.819
Can he protect her
from Col. Ki?

01:25:46.057 --> 01:25:47.456
He'll try.

01:25:49.961 --> 01:25:52.259
But he's counting
on you to do that.

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.560
Can't. Too risky. It could...

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:57.993
Blow his cover?

01:26:00.939 --> 01:26:02.463
He's The Tiger.

01:26:03.274 --> 01:26:05.037
That's why I can't intervene.

01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:06.406
Once, last night
at the church,

01:26:06.477 --> 01:26:07.569
was risky enough.

01:26:07.645 --> 01:26:09.340
Twice in 24 hours, no way.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.209
Col. Ki would
put it together.

01:26:11.282 --> 01:26:12.909
He'd know
we were being tipped off

01:26:12.984 --> 01:26:15.384
and he'd realize the man
he's hunting is General Hue.

01:26:15.453 --> 01:26:17.114
He probably already does.
Either way,

01:26:17.188 --> 01:26:18.917
you can't let Michelle
walk into it!

01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:20.116
She was safe,

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:21.883
she could have
stayed with you.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.393
Where is she?

01:26:24.228 --> 01:26:26.492
Sorry. I can't tell you that.

01:26:28.099 --> 01:26:29.191
Buck.

01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:38.507
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

01:26:42.313 --> 01:26:44.338
I won't jeopardize
this operation

01:26:44.415 --> 01:26:46.610
just so you can have
General Hue's wife.

01:26:47.385 --> 01:26:48.750
Say again?

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:51.448
If he's dead,
the lady stays with you.

01:26:51.522 --> 01:26:53.786
He knows it,
she knows it, I know it.

01:26:55.326 --> 01:26:57.157
And so do you.

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:23.833
<i>I left Buck and Mac</i>
<i>with Higgins,</i>

01:27:23.904 --> 01:27:26.236
<i>who was holding them</i>
<i>with stories from his memoirs.</i>

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.567
<i>He was also</i>
<i>holding Mac's.38.</i>

01:27:28.642 --> 01:27:30.576
<i>Rick and T.C.</i>
<i>Headed into Little Saigon</i>

01:27:30.644 --> 01:27:32.373
<i>to see if they</i>
<i>could plain luck out</i>

01:27:32.446 --> 01:27:33.674
<i>and spot Michelle</i>

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.841
<i>before she met</i>
<i>the General and Col. Ki.</i>

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:39.147
<i>And I was driving to where</i>
<i>I prayed she would be.</i>

01:27:39.553 --> 01:27:41.020
<i>The scary part</i>
<i>of all this</i>

01:27:41.088 --> 01:27:42.715
<i>was that Buck was right.</i>

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:44.451
<i>Deep down inside</i>
<i>that little black box</i>

01:27:44.525 --> 01:27:46.117
<i>we all carry around</i>

01:27:46.193 --> 01:27:47.888
<i>was hiding</i>
<i>a scared little man</i>

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.827
<i>ready to kill</i>
<i>Just to be loved.</i>

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.331
<i>I had to find Michelle.</i>

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:55.231
<i>Not just to save her,</i>
<i>but to save me.</i>

01:28:31.655 --> 01:28:34.055
No. Thomas, no.

01:29:06.403 --> 01:29:07.665
Michelle.

01:30:33.143 --> 01:30:35.577
Well, I'll be... Look!

01:31:01.972 --> 01:31:03.234
Hey, hey, hey.

01:31:03.974 --> 01:31:04.998
Michelle!

01:31:05.075 --> 01:31:07.407
You, freeze! Let her go.

01:31:07.478 --> 01:31:10.140
Back up the stairs slowly.
You, too.

01:31:11.715 --> 01:31:14.149
Tell Thomas I'm sorry,

01:31:14.485 --> 01:31:16.976
but I have to go.
There is no other way.

01:31:17.321 --> 01:31:20.313
Back up the stairs slowly!
Move it.

01:31:50.787 --> 01:31:52.015
Michelle!

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:55.457
Michelle, behind you!

01:32:07.304 --> 01:32:08.669
Oh, Thomas!

01:32:26.056 --> 01:32:27.318
Traitor.

01:33:02.025 --> 01:33:04.016
That would solve
all our problems,

01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:05.350
wouldn't it?

01:33:19.843 --> 01:33:23.301
Hue, tell her who you are,
what you're doing.

01:33:24.414 --> 01:33:28.282
I'm afraid the whole worid
may know that now.

01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.478
No.

01:33:32.556 --> 01:33:34.854
Tell the worid
The Tiger was Col. Ki.

01:33:34.925 --> 01:33:37.018
Michelle can
help you sell that.

01:33:38.695 --> 01:33:42.131
Only if she goes with me.

01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:48.303
I know that.

01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:01.849
Oh, Thomas,

01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:04.949
why couldn't you
have stayed out of it?

01:34:05.555 --> 01:34:06.852
Because I love you.

01:34:06.923 --> 01:34:09.084
And I love you. But...

01:34:11.228 --> 01:34:12.991
But you have to go.

01:34:16.933 --> 01:34:18.423
I understand.

01:34:27.778 --> 01:34:29.040
Michelle.

01:34:39.456 --> 01:34:41.447
Keep safe, until we...

01:34:57.474 --> 01:34:59.339
Keep safe, my love.

01:35:35.178 --> 01:35:38.978
<i>The C-133, bearing the bodies</i>
<i>of six American airmen</i>

01:35:39.049 --> 01:35:41.108

<i>that will never end</i>

01:36:04.774 --> 01:36:07.106
<i>until all the boys come home.</i>

01:36:07.811 --> 01:36:10.006
<i>And for some, not even then.</i>
