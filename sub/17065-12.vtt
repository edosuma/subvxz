WEBVTT

00:04.806 --> 00:06.239
Where'd you get those sunglasses?

00:06.308 --> 00:08.975
It was in a swag bag
at Jack's birthday party.

00:09.044 --> 00:10.343
Tom Ford.

00:10.412 --> 00:12.279
I think the ones I bought you
at the car wash

00:12.347 --> 00:13.280
frame your face better.

00:13.348 --> 00:14.781
It was awesome.

00:14.850 --> 00:17.484
They turned Jack's backyard
into a full-on amusement park.

00:17.552 --> 00:19.419
Carnival games on the tennis court,

00:19.488 --> 00:21.354
a roller coaster on the putting green.

00:21.423 --> 00:23.723
Yeah, we're not impressed
by any of that, are we, Greg?

00:23.792 --> 00:25.358
I got a churro at pick-up!

00:25.427 --> 00:27.594
People are going all-out
for their 13th birthdays.

00:27.663 --> 00:30.764
Why don't we throw you
a birthday party here?

00:30.832 --> 00:32.531
- You mean at our house?
- Yeah!

00:32.601 --> 00:33.867
We're not having it here.

00:33.935 --> 00:36.136
Why? Because our house isn't good enough

00:36.204 --> 00:37.470
for your fancy-ass friends?

00:37.539 --> 00:39.372
I would have been
a little harsher on the house,

00:39.441 --> 00:41.241
a little gentler on my friends.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.076
But, yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:49.918 --> 00:51.518
Oliver, this house is perfect...

00:51.586 --> 00:53.520
four walls, a roof, no one hits you.

00:53.588 --> 00:54.287
What's your problem?

00:54.356 --> 00:56.022
Mom, this is Westport.

00:56.091 --> 00:58.058
Surely there are other people
who have a house like this.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.459
They do, only it's out back

00:59.528 --> 01:01.661
and it's where they store
their rakes and pool toys.

01:01.730 --> 01:04.664
I'm just saying, I'd rather have
no party than a party here.

01:04.733 --> 01:05.865
This is on me.

01:05.934 --> 01:07.934
I should have spaced out
his vaccinations.

01:08.003 --> 01:10.270
I just didn't want to keep
driving back to the doctor.

01:10.339 --> 01:12.272
Well, you know, if we have a party,

01:12.341 --> 01:14.474
you can invite Alice McCarthy.

01:14.543 --> 01:15.709
Ooh!

01:15.777 --> 01:17.510
Taylor, worry about your own problems,

01:17.579 --> 01:19.379
like the grade
you're pulling in English.

01:19.448 --> 01:20.680
Don't listen to him.

01:20.749 --> 01:21.815
This is just a ploy
to get your attention

01:21.883 --> 01:22.949
off him and put it on me.

01:23.018 --> 01:24.284
So it's not true about your grade?

01:24.353 --> 01:25.559
Uh...

01:25.621 --> 01:26.987
He's embarrassed of you!

01:27.055 --> 01:29.623
All right! Everybody upstairs.

01:29.691 --> 01:31.558
You're all officially terrible children!

01:33.195 --> 01:34.261
Never you.

01:38.033 --> 01:40.834
Oliver is having a party here.

01:40.902 --> 01:42.535
Katie, you can't force someone
to have a party.

01:42.604 --> 01:43.770
Sure you can.

01:43.839 --> 01:45.238
You can surprise them with one.

01:45.307 --> 01:46.439
You're throwing him a surprise party?

01:46.508 --> 01:47.841
Once he gets over the initial shock,

01:47.909 --> 01:49.509
he'll see that everybody's having fun

01:49.578 --> 01:51.044
and nobody gives a damn where he lives.

01:51.113 --> 01:54.714
Then, we'll clear off the mantel
for my Mother of the Year Award.

01:54.783 --> 01:56.616
I don't think steam-rolling
over your kid

01:56.685 --> 01:58.151
and ambushing him is a great idea.

01:58.220 --> 01:59.452
I feel passionately, Greg.

01:59.521 --> 02:01.388
I am gonna throw that kid
a party so good,

02:01.456 --> 02:03.690
it's gonna knock the entitlement
right out of him.

02:03.759 --> 02:05.492
Ah, yes! A spiteful punishment party.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.127
- Good times.
- Yeah.

02:07.195 --> 02:10.096
Okay, but Oliver explicitly told you

02:10.164 --> 02:11.197
he doesn't want a birthday party?

02:11.266 --> 02:13.199
Yes, but I'm ignoring his wishes.

02:13.268 --> 02:14.801
Well, as much as he needs a lesson,

02:14.870 --> 02:16.136
I'm with Oliver on this.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.405
Westport kids expect
a certain level of extravagance

02:18.473 --> 02:19.372
at their birthday parties.

02:19.441 --> 02:21.574
Okay, so what should I do?

02:21.643 --> 02:23.276
Have you ever heard of an escape room?

02:23.345 --> 02:24.411
Angela!

02:24.479 --> 02:26.046
Your after-dark activities

02:26.114 --> 02:28.381
have no place
at a preteen birthday party!

02:28.450 --> 02:29.716
Stop.

02:29.785 --> 02:32.652
An escape room is where
you're all locked in a room,

02:32.721 --> 02:34.287
and you have to solve
a series of puzzles

02:34.356 --> 02:36.289
using clues that lead to your escape

02:36.358 --> 02:37.557
before the time runs out.

02:38.427 --> 02:39.526
I love it!

02:39.594 --> 02:41.061
Cheap, and I can do it in my basement,

02:41.129 --> 02:42.329
just like the weddings

02:42.397 --> 02:44.297
both of my daughters
are probably gonna get.

02:49.738 --> 02:51.504
Taylor, your tutor's here.

02:51.573 --> 02:52.472
My what?

02:52.541 --> 02:54.402
I asked the school
to send over a smart kid

02:54.488 --> 02:56.309
- to help you with your English.
- Mom!

02:56.378 --> 02:57.711
You're gonna thank me for this.

02:57.779 --> 02:59.012
I'm too modest to mention it,

02:59.081 --> 03:00.714
but I'm up for Mother of the Year.

03:02.684 --> 03:04.417
- Tara.
- Oh, Katie.

03:04.486 --> 03:07.087
Didn't realize this was your house.

03:07.155 --> 03:08.888
I didn't realize this was your son.

03:08.957 --> 03:11.257
<i>Ugh! Tara Summers.</i>

03:11.326 --> 03:13.760
<i>She didn't invite Anna-Kat
to her daughter's birthday,</i>

03:13.829 --> 03:15.995
<i>so I've dedicated my life to hating her.</i>

03:16.064 --> 03:18.198
<i>Feels good to have
a cause you believe in.</i>

03:18.266 --> 03:19.766
Hi, Eyo.

03:19.835 --> 03:20.934
You two know each other?

03:21.002 --> 03:22.702
I'm the only Sudanese kid in Westport.

03:22.771 --> 03:24.003
I'm hard to miss.

03:24.072 --> 03:25.138
Come on in.

03:25.207 --> 03:26.306
Here's your lunch.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.308
Oh, don't be silly. I can feed him.

03:28.377 --> 03:30.910
We're vegan, and this is a meat house.

03:30.979 --> 03:31.911
I can smell it.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.279
Okay, Tara.

03:33.348 --> 03:34.781
We'll see you in a couple of hours.

03:35.917 --> 03:37.784
- I know it was you.
- Excuse me?

03:37.853 --> 03:40.754
I know it was you
who ran that ham up my flagpole.

03:40.822 --> 03:44.758
How dare you come to my house
and accuse me of...

03:44.826 --> 03:46.192
We have security cameras.

03:49.831 --> 03:51.197
Oh, yeah, I did do that.

03:51.266 --> 03:53.066
You should have invited Anna-Kat

03:53.135 --> 03:54.200
to your daughter's birthday party.

03:54.269 --> 03:55.335
I regret nothing.

03:55.404 --> 03:56.770
You know, it figures your other daughter

03:56.838 --> 03:58.204
would need to be tutored.

03:58.273 --> 04:00.507
You know what? For a vegan
who adopted a child from Africa,

04:00.575 --> 04:04.210
you are a very bad person!

04:04.279 --> 04:05.545
Don't give him soda!

04:07.048 --> 04:09.015
Okay, this is what I'm thinking.

04:09.084 --> 04:11.251
We'll make this into the escape room,

04:11.319 --> 04:13.253
a.k.a. Skybase 17,

04:13.321 --> 04:15.255
the disabled space station
where the kids

04:15.323 --> 04:17.457
have to evacuate
before their oxygen runs out.

04:17.526 --> 04:19.559
I like it. What's my character...

04:19.628 --> 04:21.361
Central Command Officer Randall Walker,

04:21.430 --> 04:23.263
- a renegade who disobeyed orders and...
- No.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.231
Wait for it...
saved the lives of billions...

04:25.300 --> 04:27.167
- Still no...
- of space puppies.

04:30.038 --> 04:32.772
Greg! This is not your 13th birthday!

04:32.841 --> 04:34.073
No characters!

04:34.142 --> 04:35.909
You need to monitor the kids... No!

04:35.977 --> 04:37.577
And help them with their clues

04:37.646 --> 04:39.612
and make sure that they're having fun.

04:39.681 --> 04:41.414
I want to have fun, too.

04:41.483 --> 04:44.384
They need to solve an elaborate
set of puzzles and brain teasers

04:44.453 --> 04:46.953
in order to get the code
to release them from the room.

04:47.022 --> 04:48.788
That sounds complicated. How you
gonna come up with all that?

04:48.857 --> 04:51.124
Oh, I'm not going to. You are.
Did I leave that part out?

04:51.193 --> 04:52.492
Right.

04:52.561 --> 04:54.561
But, you know, it's kind of
dangerous down here.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.696
I mean, there's exposed nails,
an open junction box,

04:56.765 --> 04:59.032
and this door is falling off its hinges.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.266
I'm gonna call Don, the landlord,

05:00.335 --> 05:01.601
and have him come fix the place up.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.436
No, don't call Don.
We'll call a handyman.

05:03.505 --> 05:04.637
Why?

05:04.706 --> 05:06.372
You have to pay a handyman.
The landlord's free.

05:06.441 --> 05:08.007
Upkeep is his responsibility.

05:08.076 --> 05:09.642
Yes, but we have
a great deal on this place,

05:09.711 --> 05:11.644
and if we start complaining,
they're gonna raise our rent.

05:11.713 --> 05:13.279
We are not calling Don.

05:13.348 --> 05:14.347
Fine.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.682
If you want me to hire some drifter

05:15.750 --> 05:17.083
who's gonna steal all of our silver...

05:17.152 --> 05:18.785
I don't know why you equate
handymen with drifters.

05:18.854 --> 05:20.186
And by our silver, you mean the forks

05:20.255 --> 05:21.855
that you collect from
various dining establishments?

05:21.923 --> 05:24.924
- It is the landlord's responsibility.
- I feel passionately about it.

05:24.993 --> 05:27.093
Oh. Okay, then.

05:27.162 --> 05:28.194
That's that.

05:28.263 --> 05:29.462
Thanks.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.933
<i>So it's settled.
I'm calling the landlord.</i>

05:36.071 --> 05:38.738
Don, thank you so much
for coming by today.

05:38.807 --> 05:39.973
Uh-huh.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.708
How much longer is this going to be?

05:41.776 --> 05:43.877
My husband is going to be
back in an hour,

05:43.945 --> 05:47.146
and you can't be here when he gets back.

05:47.215 --> 05:49.015
Why not?

05:49.084 --> 05:50.583
Um...

05:50.652 --> 05:52.752
this is where he does
his nude stretching.

05:54.456 --> 05:56.656
Oh, yeah.

05:57.459 --> 05:58.591
I do that.

06:00.996 --> 06:02.896
That's great, Don.

06:02.964 --> 06:04.564
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

06:04.633 --> 06:07.200
Wow, Dad. That was,
like, a lot of bowling.

06:07.269 --> 06:09.002
I think I'm good
on that sport from now on.

06:11.406 --> 06:13.506
Surprise!

06:13.575 --> 06:15.241
Hey.

06:15.310 --> 06:16.676
He didn't suspect a thing.

06:16.745 --> 06:18.545
He even asked about dinner,
and I was like,

06:18.613 --> 06:20.280
"Maybe we'll order pizza. I don't know."

06:21.249 --> 06:22.882
Not so bad, right?

06:22.951 --> 06:25.385
You've ruined my life,
and I'll never forgive you.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.786
You're right.

06:26.855 --> 06:30.757
I am the greatest mom ever!
Happy birthday, baby!

06:38.180 --> 06:40.280
So, this is your place.

06:40.349 --> 06:42.182
Never had us over to your casa before.

06:42.251 --> 06:43.884
Yeah.

06:43.952 --> 06:46.253
Five minutes until
the escape room opens!

06:46.321 --> 06:48.755
Most of the time, they tear these down

06:48.824 --> 06:51.691
and build, like, a... you know, a house.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.426
Well, the thing is,

06:53.495 --> 06:55.896
this place might look like
we have nothing,

06:55.964 --> 06:58.265
but actually...

06:58.333 --> 06:59.666
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

06:59.735 --> 07:01.067
Come on, amigo.

07:01.136 --> 07:02.068
Spill it.

07:02.137 --> 07:03.803
You can tell us.

07:03.872 --> 07:05.872
Okay, but this is top secret,

07:05.941 --> 07:08.642
so I'm expecting you guys
to have my back... for real.

07:08.710 --> 07:10.777
Not in the way we said
we had Eric Porter's back,

07:10.846 --> 07:13.914
then convinced him it was mandatory
to get naked for his lice check.

07:13.982 --> 07:15.468
Classic.

07:17.586 --> 07:20.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening up there?

07:20.089 --> 07:21.354
What?

07:21.423 --> 07:22.556
You're wearing mascara.

07:22.624 --> 07:23.890
No, I'm not.

07:23.959 --> 07:25.926
I just have Dad's
beautiful, lush lashes.

07:25.994 --> 07:27.494
You're welcome.

07:32.701 --> 07:33.733
Eyo.

07:33.802 --> 07:34.968
Hello, Mrs. Otto.

07:35.037 --> 07:38.238
Did not know you guys are
studying tonight.

07:38.307 --> 07:39.706
Well, there's this
extra-credit assignment

07:39.775 --> 07:41.808
to watch "The Great Gatsby,"
but we won't get in the way.

07:41.877 --> 07:43.477
- We'll just be in Dad's office.
- Mm.

07:49.351 --> 07:50.884
Oh, God.

07:50.953 --> 07:52.252
She's falling for the spawn

07:52.321 --> 07:54.221
of the worst human being on this planet.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.756
You say that about a lot of people...
Viv, Crossing Guard Sandy,

07:56.825 --> 07:58.258
that police officer
who keeps calling you ma'am.

07:58.327 --> 07:59.960
I am not a ma'am yet!

08:00.028 --> 08:01.828
Tara Summers is the worst.

08:01.897 --> 08:03.530
- I'm going to stop this right now.
- No, no, no, no.

08:03.599 --> 08:06.833
If you do that, that'll only
make her like him more.

08:06.902 --> 08:08.468
Then what should we do?

08:08.537 --> 08:12.472
We have in our possession
the world's ultimate romance killer.

08:18.213 --> 08:21.181
I'm Super Girl!

08:21.250 --> 08:23.083
I skipped dessert.

08:23.152 --> 08:26.620
That's a green light.

08:26.688 --> 08:28.088
You're home, you're home!

08:28.157 --> 08:29.656
No...

08:31.760 --> 08:33.393
Whee!

08:33.462 --> 08:34.727
Why?

08:36.164 --> 08:37.864
She's definitely the one for the job.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.698
If we weren't having a party right now,

08:39.768 --> 08:42.769
the things that I would do to you
that Anna-Kat would interrupt.

08:42.837 --> 08:44.171
Mmm...

08:46.041 --> 08:48.441
All right, kids! The airlock is open.

08:48.510 --> 08:50.544
Please proceed to the basement.

08:50.612 --> 08:53.141
Anna-Kat, a word.

08:55.817 --> 08:57.450
- Um, Dad?
- Yeah?

08:57.519 --> 08:59.286
- Can I ask a favor?
- Okay.

09:02.824 --> 09:04.524
So, you know how Mom's
throwing this party

09:04.593 --> 09:05.859
so I can be honest about who I am?

09:05.928 --> 09:06.960
Yeah.

09:07.029 --> 09:09.396
Well, I kind of went
the other way with it.

09:09.464 --> 09:10.664
Go on.

09:10.732 --> 09:12.065
Well, I might have left the impression

09:12.134 --> 09:14.367
that we have a bit more money
than we actually do.

09:14.436 --> 09:15.602
How much more?

09:15.671 --> 09:18.939
Private jet, an island,
Swiss bank accounts,

09:19.007 --> 09:20.240
and that you're under investigation

09:20.309 --> 09:22.342
for money laundering, so
we have to keep a low profile.

09:22.411 --> 09:23.476
Are you crazy?

09:23.545 --> 09:24.945
I know it wasn't the right thing to do,

09:25.013 --> 09:27.414
but I said it in the moment,
and I need you to back me up.

09:27.482 --> 09:28.682
I'm not gonna lie for you, Oliver.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.850
- No? You lied to me.
- Excuse me?

09:30.919 --> 09:32.452
You lied to get me out of the house

09:32.521 --> 09:34.955
so you could throw a party
you knew I didn't want.

09:35.023 --> 09:38.391
I expect this from Mom, but not you.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.660
I didn't pull the trigger!
I was just driving the car!

09:43.432 --> 09:45.165
Can you see okay?

09:45.234 --> 09:46.132
That's better.

09:47.536 --> 09:49.135
Make room!

09:51.540 --> 09:52.772
I want to hang out with you tonight.

09:55.877 --> 09:57.978
Once the airlock is sealed,
you must work together

09:58.046 --> 09:59.713
to solve the riddles of the escape room

09:59.781 --> 10:01.748
and figure out the code
that will set you free.

10:01.817 --> 10:04.284
If you fail, your oxygen will run out

10:04.353 --> 10:06.286
and your lungs will collapse.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.520
Actually, they would
fill with water vapor

10:07.589 --> 10:08.622
and eventually explode.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.390
- You don't know that.
- I don't.

10:10.459 --> 10:12.592
But with a degree in space
medicine, Randall Walker...

10:12.661 --> 10:13.968
Buddy, you're killing me
with the Randall Walker.

10:13.993 --> 10:15.588
You're just the monitor.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.832
Once you've figured out the code,

10:18.900 --> 10:21.401
you tell the monitor...

10:21.470 --> 10:24.638
and he will put you
on the next rocket ship home.

10:24.706 --> 10:26.406
My dad's been on a Russian rocket.

10:26.475 --> 10:28.875
My dad has a minority stake
in the Houston Rockets.

10:28.944 --> 10:29.809
Okay.

10:29.878 --> 10:30.944
You have 60 minutes.

10:31.013 --> 10:33.780
Your time begins now!

10:33.849 --> 10:34.781
<i>Engaging airlock.</i>

10:34.850 --> 10:37.684
We want in.
Anna-Kat won't leave us alone.

10:37.753 --> 10:39.886
Ugh! I will have a word with Anna-Kat.

10:39.955 --> 10:41.221
Keep an eye on them.

10:41.290 --> 10:43.256
I don't want any "Blue Lagoon"
stuff happening down here.

10:43.325 --> 10:44.891
- What?
- It was Brooke Shields.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.493
She was too young and super naked.

10:50.866 --> 10:53.166
<i>59 minutes remaining.</i>

10:53.235 --> 10:55.168
What are you doing?!
You're all gonna die!

10:57.000 --> 11:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:09.685 --> 11:11.017
That's Haley Joel Osment.

11:11.086 --> 11:12.786
That's Hailee Steinfeld.

11:12.854 --> 11:14.287
They're all Haleys.

11:14.356 --> 11:15.488
Halley's Comet!

11:15.557 --> 11:17.357
Look around for a comet!

11:20.395 --> 11:21.428
Comet!

11:24.032 --> 11:25.699
I found a code number!

11:30.672 --> 11:32.105
This is fun.

11:32.174 --> 11:33.239
Totally.

11:36.078 --> 11:37.577
So, Oliver...

11:37.646 --> 11:39.979
How long have you guys been in hiding?

11:40.048 --> 11:42.148
As long as we've been in town. Why?

11:42.217 --> 11:44.117
'Cause I found this photo
in a box of stuff.

11:44.186 --> 11:47.520
It says "Williamsburg 2011,"

11:47.589 --> 11:50.690
but you still have
that same crappy mini van.

11:50.759 --> 11:54.094
So, you had a custom Bentley
but you still drove that mini van?

11:54.162 --> 11:56.096
Doesn't add up, hombre.

11:56.164 --> 11:59.332
Oh. Um, well...

11:59.401 --> 12:01.401
Oliver, tell them the truth.

12:04.172 --> 12:05.338
Fine. I'll do it.

12:07.843 --> 12:10.276
I had the picture photoshopped
in case the feds came snooping.

12:10.345 --> 12:12.011
You can never be too careful.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.013
Oh, and my real name, you ask?

12:14.082 --> 12:16.516
Walker... Captain Randall J. Walker.

12:16.647 --> 12:17.662
Thank you.

12:22.691 --> 12:23.823
Where is he?!

12:23.892 --> 12:25.091
No knocking? You know what?

12:25.160 --> 12:26.326
Why don't you adopt some manners

12:26.395 --> 12:27.660
instead of just kids from Africa?

12:27.729 --> 12:29.129
My son's not answering his phone,

12:29.197 --> 12:30.697
and my text messages are unread.

12:30.766 --> 12:32.899
He never ignores my messages!

12:32.968 --> 12:35.502
Oh, that's because I took his phone,

12:35.570 --> 12:37.971
- and he's trapped in my basement.
- What?!

12:38.039 --> 12:40.540
It's an escape-room party
for my son's birthday.

12:40.609 --> 12:42.142
Eyo and Taylor joined in.

12:42.210 --> 12:44.043
- I want to see him.
- You can't.

12:44.112 --> 12:46.913
They're on the space station,
and the door is airlocked...

12:46.982 --> 12:49.182
Give me my son!

12:50.652 --> 12:52.118
Fine.

12:52.187 --> 12:55.121
A little dramatic, Tara. I think
you're anemic. Have a hamburger.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.992
Hey, got another number.

13:01.029 --> 13:02.061
Aw, bam!

13:02.130 --> 13:03.496
Well done.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.331
20 minutes left and 3 clues to find.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.399
And I set up a little thing

13:06.468 --> 13:07.634
where the lights flicker on and off.

13:07.702 --> 13:09.002
It's really cool.

13:09.070 --> 13:13.072
Okay, so the clue is Ursa, Orion, Ursa.

13:13.141 --> 13:14.741
How are we supposed
to get the combination?

13:14.810 --> 13:17.277
Try 7, 3, 7.

13:23.718 --> 13:25.084
How did you know that?

13:25.153 --> 13:27.587
Well, there are seven stars
in Ursa Major,

13:27.656 --> 13:30.690
three stars in Orion's Belt,
and seven stars in Ursa Minor.

13:30.759 --> 13:31.891
7, 3, 7.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.026
Wow.

13:33.094 --> 13:36.262
You found an actual use for being smart.

13:36.331 --> 13:37.764
Ah, constellations.

13:37.833 --> 13:41.000
How I love to look up at them
from our boat on Lake Como.

13:41.069 --> 13:42.869
Oh, we have a lake villa there.

13:42.938 --> 13:44.137
North or South Shore?

13:44.206 --> 13:46.506
Actually, Palazzo de Walker
is on the Eastern Shore.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.341
Perhaps you know it... striped awnings.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.010
We shoot fireworks off the
veranda every Winter Solstice.

13:51.079 --> 13:52.779
Okay, Dad,
don't let it get away from you.

13:52.848 --> 13:56.282
Ah, the Lago de Como.
Bellissima. Bellissima.

13:56.351 --> 13:58.284
<i>The door is totally jammed.</i>

13:58.353 --> 14:00.086
<i>Stupid landlord did a crap job.</i>

14:00.155 --> 14:01.421
<i>Should've called a drifter.</i>

14:01.490 --> 14:02.956
Greg!

14:03.024 --> 14:05.925
Hey, Katie. Going great in here.
Kids have found almost all the clues.

14:05.994 --> 14:07.927
- The door's stuck.
- What?

14:07.996 --> 14:09.395
The door's stuck.

14:09.464 --> 14:11.264
You can't escape from the escape room.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.132
Katie, where the hell is my kid?!

14:13.201 --> 14:14.267
Getting him!

14:16.204 --> 14:17.504
Son of a bitch!

14:20.645 --> 14:21.894
Greg.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.515
Katie, the kids
have almost solved the puzzle.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.021
I have to open the door.
What am I supposed to do?

14:25.104 --> 14:26.897
Stall them. Just stay calm.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.271
What is going on down here?

14:28.342 --> 14:31.669
Get up there and tell me
when the landlord gets here.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.838
Landlord? Why did you call the landlord?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.440
Oh, it's not a big deal.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.707
He's the one who put the door back on.

14:36.754 --> 14:38.142
It is a big deal!

14:38.211 --> 14:39.944
We agreed you were gonna call
the handyman, remember?

14:40.013 --> 14:41.179
I was very passionate about it!

14:41.247 --> 14:43.481
Greg, he is not going to raise our rent.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.049
This is his fault!

14:45.118 --> 14:47.251
I can't believe you did this.
You steam-rolled right over me!

14:47.320 --> 14:49.654
Mama! There's a man at the door!

14:49.722 --> 14:50.922
I'll be right back.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.457
Don't let the kids know
that there's anything wrong.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.526
Something is very wrong! Very wrong!

14:55.595 --> 14:58.096
<i>Two minutes remaining.</i>

14:58.164 --> 14:59.363
Hey, it worked.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.665
This isn't over!

15:00.733 --> 15:01.833
Are you even there?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.103
Ugh. Come here.

15:05.171 --> 15:08.172
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, Don.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.774
My band goes on in 40 minutes.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.809
Oh, we'd love
to come watch you sometime.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.444
No, you don't. No one does.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.080
Get out of the way, Tara!

15:16.149 --> 15:17.648
- I can't breathe!
- I need air!

15:17.717 --> 15:18.983
Goodbye, muchachos!

15:19.052 --> 15:20.218
They're running out of air!

15:20.286 --> 15:22.153
Can you do me a favor
and hang out with my husband

15:22.222 --> 15:24.522
so he can see how good he has it?

15:34.767 --> 15:37.452
- I found it!
- <i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

15:38.805 --> 15:41.639
- Just in time. 20 seconds left.
- Open the hatch.

15:41.708 --> 15:42.940
Well, you still have
to unscramble the code.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.277
It's my birthday.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.019
He got it!

16:01.161 --> 16:02.556
I'll send the code to Central Command.

16:02.581 --> 16:05.042
- Just in time.
- <i>10 seconds.</i>

16:05.598 --> 16:07.064
<i>9...</i>

16:07.133 --> 16:09.033
<i>8...</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:10.835
<i>7...</i>

16:10.903 --> 16:12.737
<i>6...</i>

16:12.805 --> 16:14.505
<i>5...</i>

16:14.574 --> 16:15.940
<i>4...</i>

16:16.009 --> 16:18.309
<i>3...</i>

16:18.378 --> 16:19.577
<i>2...</i>

16:19.646 --> 16:21.379
- Dad, the clock. Open the door.
- <i>1...</i>

16:21.447 --> 16:22.913
<i>Red alert.</i>

16:22.982 --> 16:25.216
<i>Oxygen stores empty.</i>

16:28.655 --> 16:30.054
<i>Airlock released.</i>

16:35.094 --> 16:37.228
Thanks for helping out, Don.
Please stay for cake.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.163
That's fine. My band doesn't
need me anyway.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.998
I only play tambourine.

16:42.835 --> 16:43.901
Eyo.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.670
- What are you doing here?
- I'm taking you home.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.071
I'm not ready to go yet.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.510
Eyo Buckley Summers,
what has gotten into you?!

16:52.578 --> 16:53.966
Excuse me!

16:56.082 --> 16:57.448
I specifically, passionately

16:57.517 --> 16:58.616
told you not to call him.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.418
Greg, he was happy to do it.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.453
He doesn't look happy.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.195
He looks as happy as any 50-year-old
tambourine player is ever gonna look.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.525
Great birthday.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.227
I didn't realize
how tired I was of having

17:09.295 --> 17:10.761
all those celebrities at our parties.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.430
I mean, not Beyoncé. She's awesome.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.964
But the rest of those yahoos...

17:14.032 --> 17:16.834
Oh, supermarket cake is so much
better than expensive cake.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.569
Glad you guys are enjoying it.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.972
I wish my family was super
wealthy pretending to be poor.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.040
Yeah, hiding billions
has its advantages.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.146
That is not happening.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.616
I don't want my son cavorting
with your daughter.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.184
That is the only thing
in the entire world

17:33.253 --> 17:34.518
that I agree with you on.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.555
That and the fact
that eating veal is cruel....

17:37.624 --> 17:38.923
and delicious.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.963
Well, hi, Don. You want some more cake?

17:47.205 --> 17:48.408
Weirdest thing...

17:48.502 --> 17:51.205
Those boys over there are talking
about how rich you guys are.

17:51.299 --> 17:53.170
- What?
- Yeah, you've got all kinds of money

17:53.239 --> 17:54.939
hidden in Swiss bank accounts.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.941
Said you were telling them all about it.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.175
So I can explain.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.044
My mom's been giving you guys
a break on rent

18:00.113 --> 18:03.514
'cause she thought you had
modest means and were good people.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.550
Seems like she doesn't know
the whole story.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.185
I got this, I got this.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.488
Don.

18:10.556 --> 18:12.523
I was lying for my son

18:12.592 --> 18:14.325
so that he would look good
in front of his friends.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.960
I promise you. We are not rich.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.395
Uh-huh.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.997
Well, I'm gonna go talk
to my mom about your rent,

18:20.066 --> 18:22.867
and I'm gonna do it
in the middle of "Steve Harvey,"

18:22.935 --> 18:25.385
and she's gonna be real mad.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.279
Oliver, can I talk to you in private?

18:35.348 --> 18:36.781
Sure.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.986
I just overheard your dad say
you're not really rich.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.020
What's going on?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.255
That's because...

18:46.592 --> 18:47.758
...I'm not.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.193
I'm lying.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.328
This is me.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.896
This is where I live.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.898
This is my small crappy house.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.568
Your house isn't crappy.
You can have fun here.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.003
My house is like a museum.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.639
There's, like, one couch
we're allowed to sit on.

19:01.708 --> 19:02.873
Really?

19:02.942 --> 19:05.042
Yeah, that's what I like about you.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.678
You're different
than all these other guys.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.214
Yeah, you know, I'm just regular people.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.924
Happy birthday.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.169
This is bad, Katie, really bad.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.537
What was he talking about?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.773
Why exactly does Don think
that we're rich?

19:35.842 --> 19:38.309
Well, Oliver was embarrassed
about the house and...

19:38.378 --> 19:41.412
So you said that we had
Swiss bank accounts?

19:41.481 --> 19:44.281
Katie, this whole thing is on you.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.150
You forced this party on Oliver.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.985
You blatantly went behind
my back with the landlord.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.553
Yes, I lied,

19:49.622 --> 19:50.888
but none of this would've happened

19:50.957 --> 19:53.591
if you, for once,
didn't steam-roll over people

19:53.659 --> 19:55.593
and, instead, actually did
what they wanted.

19:58.097 --> 20:01.031
That's true. You're right.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.901
I really screwed up this time.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.469
I am so sorry.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.971
Now who knows what's gonna happen?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.140
They could raise the rent,
and then we couldn't live here.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.709
What are you talking about?
We have to live here.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.377
This is the best house ever.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.613
- Hmm?
- And this was the best party ever.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.648
And you're the best mom ever.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.788
Forget it.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.556
Steam-rolling is back, baby.

20:28.873 --> 20:31.287
The party was great, and that was
the best cake I ever had.

20:31.366 --> 20:34.275
You ate the cake?
It has eggs and milk in it.

20:34.369 --> 20:35.970
You should try using those things.

20:36.064 --> 20:37.476
Get in the car.

20:37.564 --> 20:39.497
So, another study session tomorrow?

20:39.566 --> 20:41.699
Yeah. I'd like that.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.539
Your daughter is already

20:48.608 --> 20:50.408
bringing my son down to your level.

20:50.477 --> 20:52.844
Yes, she is.

20:52.912 --> 20:54.846
She's gonna destroy him.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.120
