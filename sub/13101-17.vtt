00:02.167 --> 00:03.875
(Ivanova)
Commander's personal log.

00:03.958 --> 00:06.125
The war to liberate Earth
and her colonies continue.

00:06.208 --> 00:07.875
[laser gunshots]

00:10.167 --> 00:13.333
(Ivanova)
We have more Earth ships
on our side than ever before.

00:13.417 --> 00:15.292
But the battles
are becoming more desperate

00:15.375 --> 00:17.292
the closer we get to home.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.250
[explosion]

00:20.333 --> 00:21.667
Near-proximity hit.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.250
Ten percent damage to the hull.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.250
Auto-repair systems are moving
as fast as they can to keep up.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.708
Status?

00:27.792 --> 00:29.792
The Hydra and the Delphi

00:29.875 --> 00:32.083
are out of commission
and withdrawing.

00:32.167 --> 00:36.417
The rest are moving in
for a counterstrike against us.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.250
Dammit, they're outnumbered.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.083
Their jump engines are down.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.958
They can't beat us,
they can't escape.

00:44.042 --> 00:45.042
Why don't they surrender?

00:45.125 --> 00:47.625
[explosion]

00:47.708 --> 00:49.458
(Ivanova)
This is the hardest part
of all.

00:49.542 --> 00:50.875
Fighting our own.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.083
[explosion]

00:55.375 --> 00:57.583
(Ivanova)
Franklin and Lyta
should be on Mars by now

00:57.667 --> 00:59.083
along with their cargo.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.375
Our resources
are stretched to the limit.

01:03.458 --> 01:07.167
Everything's riding on what
happens in the next few weeks.

01:07.250 --> 01:09.333
This is endgame.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.167
We'll be okay as long
as nothing goes wrong.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.500
- You took care of it?
- Yeah.

01:26.583 --> 01:27.958
Yeah, it's done.

01:28.042 --> 01:30.250
Captain Sheridan's
father is in custody.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.500
He's being shipped to a
temporary staging area on Mars

01:32.583 --> 01:33.792
so we can keep an eye on him.

01:33.875 --> 01:34.958
I'll contact Sheridan as soon as

01:35.042 --> 01:36.625
everything is in place.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.667
Are you sure he'll come?

01:38.750 --> 01:40.667
Yeah, he'll come.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.000
Good. Good.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.417
Let me know
when he's in custody.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.833
Yeah, alright.

01:46.917 --> 01:49.833
Mr. Garibaldi.

01:49.917 --> 01:52.125
I know this is hard for you

01:52.208 --> 01:56.000
but, uh, it really
is for his own good.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.833
It's for everyone's good.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.000
Once he's out of the picture

01:59.083 --> 02:00.833
President Clark
will lower his guard.

02:00.917 --> 02:02.792
Then we can deal with him
and the Psi Corps.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.000
In the final analysis

02:06.083 --> 02:08.583
once he's better,
Sheridan may even thank you.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.958
Somehow I doubt it.

02:11.042 --> 02:14.125
Well, we'll have to see.

02:14.208 --> 02:18.542
Still, once this is done,
I can tell you the rest.

02:18.625 --> 02:19.917
The truth.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.042
The whole, absolute truth
is only a few days away.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.000
How many people can say that?

02:25.083 --> 02:26.667
I don't know.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.708
But I think the last guy
got 30 pieces of silver

02:28.792 --> 02:30.542
for the same job.

02:39.375 --> 02:41.792
[instrumental music]

02:41.875 --> 02:43.875
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

02:43.958 --> 02:45.833
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.917
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.583
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.875
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

02:52.958 --> 02:54.500
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.208
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

02:56.292 --> 02:58.083
(Londo)
It was a new age.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.958
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:00.042 --> 03:03.000
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:05.417 --> 03:07.917
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.250
(Sheridan)
The place Babylon 5.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.792
[theme music]

03:41.542 --> 03:44.083
[music continues]

04:11.917 --> 04:13.083
[explosion]

04:16.333 --> 04:18.208
White Star 20 is hit.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.833
- How bad?
- Minimal.

04:20.917 --> 04:25.000
They're withdrawing until the
auto-repair systems can cut in.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.125
No, I just don't understand.

04:28.917 --> 04:32.083
They have to know
they can't win.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.000
Why don't they surrender?

04:35.167 --> 04:36.958
They can't wanna die.

04:37.042 --> 04:38.750
Not for Clark.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.583
This is John Sheridan
to Earth Fleet.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.167
I say again,
you are ordered to stand down

04:47.250 --> 04:49.458
and surrender your vessels.

04:49.542 --> 04:51.625
We have no desire
to destroy your ships

04:51.708 --> 04:53.292
but if you continue to fight

04:53.375 --> 04:54.875
we'll have no choice.

04:54.958 --> 04:56.250
(Leo)
'What difference does it make?'

04:56.333 --> 04:57.833
'We're dead anyway!'

04:57.917 --> 05:00.208
It's the Cadmus.
Captain Leo Frank.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.500
What are you talking about?

05:03.583 --> 05:05.083
(Leo)
'What do you think
I'm talkin' about?'

05:05.167 --> 05:07.417
'We've been briefed
on your campaign, Sheridan.'

05:07.500 --> 05:09.083
As soon as our forces surrender

05:09.167 --> 05:11.250
our crews are taken out,
executed

05:11.333 --> 05:13.708
and then replaced
by Minbari crews.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.375
Is that what you've been told?

05:15.458 --> 05:17.917
It is, and I believe it.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.792
(Mackie)
'Then you're even dumber
than you were at the academy.'

05:21.875 --> 05:24.375
Who's that? Mackie?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.708
Mackie, is that you?

05:25.792 --> 05:27.583
- 'Alive and well.'
- 'But we heard you--'

05:27.667 --> 05:30.667
Yeah, I know what you heard,
and it's a load of crap.

05:30.750 --> 05:34.542
I'm alive. Every member
of my crew is still here.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.417
I don't care what
you've heard about Sheridan.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.583
You know me, Leo.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.667
Everything I tell you
is on the up and up.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.708
Stand down.
You won't be harmed.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.833
(Marcus)
'Nothing yet.'

05:53.250 --> 05:55.167
Come on. Don't be stupid.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.917
Picking up a signal.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.875
'They're standing down.'

06:00.958 --> 06:02.583
Sheridan to attack fleet.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.000
They've given
the surrender order.

06:04.083 --> 06:07.250
Cease fire.
I repeat, cease fire.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.500
- Tell the others--
- 'Just a minute!'

06:08.583 --> 06:10.500
There's a jump point opening.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.833
(James)
'Agamemnon to Sheridan.'

06:15.917 --> 06:18.292
'Agamemnon to Sheridan.'

06:18.375 --> 06:20.375
That's my old ship.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.833
Sheridan to Agamemnon.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.792
Tell me you're not
here for a fight.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.375
(James)
'Negative, captain.'

06:28.458 --> 06:30.792
'We've been chasing you
for days, but you're too fast.'

06:30.875 --> 06:32.250
We couldn't catch you.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.833
We're looking to join up,
if you don't mind.

06:34.917 --> 06:38.667
Mind? Hell, you've just
made my whole day.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.042
Stand by. I'm comin' aboard.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.250
Is that a good idea?

06:43.333 --> 06:44.708
They're my crew.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.083
I trained them myself

06:46.167 --> 06:47.500
including her captain.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.125
I trust them implicitly.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.083
You have the helm, Marcus.

07:02.042 --> 07:03.958
Ah, Stephen, good to see you.

07:04.042 --> 07:06.750
- Good to see you too.
- You got here fast.

07:06.833 --> 07:09.542
Yeah, well, with so many ships
called away to fight our forces

07:09.625 --> 07:11.000
we were able to slip through.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.167
This is Lyta Alexander.
She's a telepath.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.250
Lyta, this is Number One.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.083
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

07:18.167 --> 07:20.167
You came through here
a couple of years ago.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.500
You didn't say anything
about being a telepath.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.833
I couldn't. I was on the run
from the Psi Corps.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.542
You should've told us.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.708
And, you,
are you out of your mind?

07:28.792 --> 07:30.625
What the hell are you doing
bringing a teep down here

07:30.708 --> 07:32.083
when we are ready to move?

07:32.167 --> 07:34.042
Are you trying
to compromise my security?

07:34.125 --> 07:35.458
Look, it's okay.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.667
No, it's not okay.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.417
I didn't know about her,
but you did.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.542
You should've warned me.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.000
You can trust her.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.208
Alright, I'd put
my life in her hands.

07:44.292 --> 07:46.458
Fine. That's your choice.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.125
But when it's my life,
I'd like to have a thing or two

07:48.208 --> 07:50.333
to say about it, if it's all
the same to both of you.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.125
Alright, alright. I'm sorry.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.042
If it's a problem,
I can go topside.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.125
I'll find a place to stay
un-until you need me.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.125
No. It's okay.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.667
Now, she needs to stay here
with the rest of us.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.542
We may need her
at a moment's notice.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.125
What for?

08:06.958 --> 08:08.250
Our cargo.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.292
What cargo?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.375
That cargo.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.625
Hold it.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.083
- More telepaths?
- Yep.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.833
- How many?
- A lot.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.833
Mister, you've got one hell
of a lot of explaining to do.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.000
(female #1)
'Captain's on deck.'

08:47.000 --> 08:48.417
As you were.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.250
The place hasn't changed.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.042
Well, not perceptibly, sir.

08:53.125 --> 08:56.000
We have updated the DX-419
tracking system.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.125
It's about time.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.875
Of course, the main reason
for the update

08:58.958 --> 09:01.625
was to make it easier
to find you, sir.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.667
Well, at least some good
has come out of this.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.792
That thing never worked right
from the first day we got it.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.250
- How's the crew?
- Good. Good.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.667
Lieutenant Chase
is out on pregnancy leave.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.250
Miller is back Earthside

09:13.333 --> 09:16.625
recuperating from injuries
he sustained in a firefight

09:16.708 --> 09:19.833
against raiders off of Io
a couple of months ago

09:19.917 --> 09:21.125
and the rest of the crew

09:21.208 --> 09:23.833
has been busy following
your adventures, sir.

09:23.917 --> 09:26.500
Ever since you made it known
that Clark was responsible

09:26.583 --> 09:29.000
for Santiago's assassination.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.917
To tell you the truth, captain

09:32.000 --> 09:34.458
some of us thought maybe
you were out of control.

09:34.542 --> 09:35.833
We just kept
hearing these stories.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.000
I understand.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.708
And then came Nightwatch

09:38.792 --> 09:40.958
and the illegal orders
to take out civilian targets

09:41.042 --> 09:43.625
so we knew who was
telling the truth.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.125
The crew trusts you, captain.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.833
They believe that
you're a pain in the ass, sir

09:49.917 --> 09:51.208
but they trust you.

09:51.292 --> 09:53.917
So we voted to join up with you
as soon as we could.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.500
Well, I can't tell you what
it means to have you aboard.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.750
Makes me think we might
actually win this one.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.083
Well, you haven't lost
one yet, sir.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.333
Oh, I've lost a few.

10:02.417 --> 10:04.917
Just made damn sure
nobody heard about it.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.333
We've got a signal
coming in for you, sir.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.833
Alright, put it through to my..

10:10.917 --> 10:12.458
Main console.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.000
Marcus, what's up?

10:18.083 --> 10:20.792
We're receiving a transmission
from Mr. Garibaldi.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.875
He needs to speak with you.
Says it's important.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.583
Alright. Put him through.

10:29.417 --> 10:30.958
Mr. Garibaldi.

10:31.042 --> 10:32.375
What is it?

10:32.458 --> 10:34.875
Captain, I just thought
you should know.

10:34.958 --> 10:37.667
Okay, look, we're not exactly
on the best terms right now

10:37.750 --> 10:39.875
but they've got your dad, John.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.375
They traced him
through his medication

10:41.458 --> 10:43.042
and picked him up
at a safe house two days ago

10:43.125 --> 10:44.833
just outside of Chicago.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.292
Is he alright?

10:46.375 --> 10:48.667
It's hard to get good
information, but I think so.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.708
Now they're gonna use him
to get to you.

10:50.792 --> 10:54.333
If you don't surrender,
they're gonna kill him.

10:54.417 --> 10:55.542
'Now, look,
we've got a couple of days'

10:55.625 --> 10:56.875
'before they can move on this'

10:56.958 --> 10:58.292
and we should be able
to break him out.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.542
And I've got some people
who can help

10:59.625 --> 11:00.542
but they want a meeting.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.750
They know your rep

11:01.833 --> 11:03.333
but thanks to
Clark's police state

11:03.417 --> 11:04.750
they're afraid of being set up.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.583
So it's gotta be
just you and me.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.250
Nobody else.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.417
Come on, John, if we're gonna
do this, we got to move fast.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.625
I need an answer.
I need it now.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.083
Captain, I don't
think you should..

11:16.167 --> 11:18.500
If it were your father
what would you do?

11:22.750 --> 11:23.792
Alright.

11:23.875 --> 11:26.125
I'll need to verify this
through my people.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.042
'But if it's true..'

11:28.125 --> 11:29.542
'...you tell 'em
I'll be there..'

11:30.500 --> 11:31.750
...alone.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.208
[instrumental music]

11:39.042 --> 11:40.458
Captain, I strongly object.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.333
- Your objection is noted.
- 'I mean it, John.'

11:42.417 --> 11:44.125
(Ivanova)
'And I don't like the way
this thing sounds'

11:44.208 --> 11:46.042
'I don't like the way it looks,
I don't like anything about it.'

11:46.125 --> 11:48.292
- 'It stinks of a setup.'
- Look, Susan.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.750
Michael and I have had
our problems lately

11:50.833 --> 11:53.458
but he has never given me reason
to think he meant me harm.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.167
Well, maybe so, but what if
his information is wrong?

11:56.250 --> 11:57.792
(Sheridan)
It's not.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.042
I just got word
from my contacts on Earth.

12:00.125 --> 12:03.125
They got my dad two days ago,
just like Michael said.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.250
(Ivanova)
'Well, at least let me
send Marcus with you.'

12:05.333 --> 12:07.167
Marcus needs to be
here as your liaison

12:07.250 --> 12:09.292
with the rest of the fleet
while I am gone.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.750
Now, I will listen to what
Garibaldi has to say

12:11.833 --> 12:14.125
and if there's any way
we can make this work

12:14.208 --> 12:15.292
we'll find it.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.833
Wh-what do you mean, my liaison?

12:16.917 --> 12:19.000
I want you to take my place
during my absence.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.875
You take White Star 40
and get here as fast as you can.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.292
- But shouldn't Delenn?
- 'No, she's not back yet.'

12:24.375 --> 12:26.125
(Sheridan)
'We need to keep this
a clean fight.'

12:26.208 --> 12:29.125
That means human commanding
officers only.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.000
Last time an assault
fleet came to Earth

12:31.083 --> 12:32.917
it was under Minbari command.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.375
We don't want the folks
back home thinkin'

12:34.458 --> 12:37.083
the Minbari war
is happening all over again.

12:37.167 --> 12:39.667
- It has to be one of us.
- Alright.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.042
I guess you have to
try and get him back.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.833
I have to.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.417
If I don't

12:45.500 --> 12:47.625
I'll regret it
the rest of my life.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.167
Take care, Susan.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.792
'I'll see you soon.'

12:54.417 --> 12:55.958
Are you sure you want
to go along with this?

12:56.042 --> 12:57.667
We've got
the current access codes.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.083
We can get in
and out of the area

12:59.167 --> 13:00.750

without setting off

13:00.833 --> 13:02.083

13:02.167 --> 13:03.208
Alright.

13:03.292 --> 13:04.875
As soon as we make
the jump from hyperspace

13:04.958 --> 13:07.167
I'll take down
one of your thunderbolts

13:07.250 --> 13:08.667
land just outside the colony.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.667
If everything goes right, I'll
be in and out in a few hours.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.750
You'll have the best
fighter we've got.

13:59.292 --> 14:00.542
What?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.583
You really don't know?

14:04.375 --> 14:06.208
Well, I'll bet she does.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.583
Well, in that case,
you only have to let me know

14:10.667 --> 14:12.292
what the hell is goin' on.

14:13.292 --> 14:14.708
She can do it.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.792
Someone's dumped several dozen
cryonic freezers on me

14:16.875 --> 14:18.292
and I have to find
room for them.

14:18.375 --> 14:20.292
I have no time for this.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.417
[sighs]

14:24.250 --> 14:26.583
She's talking about
the new bloodhound units.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.083
The telepaths assigned
to the military divisions

14:30.167 --> 14:31.833
occupying Mars.

14:33.333 --> 14:37.292
Anyone suspected of being
in the resistance is scanned.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.833
They're very deep scans.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.667
The trouble with deep scans
is they can cause

14:41.750 --> 14:44.625
heart attacks,
seizures, strokes..

14:44.708 --> 14:47.042
There's been several deaths.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.625
She's right to be upset.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.792
Well, how did you
find out about this?

14:52.875 --> 14:56.458
Once I got taken off the rogue
list, I began to hear things.

14:56.542 --> 14:59.500
But we always keep it
inside the Corps.

14:59.583 --> 15:00.875
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

15:00.958 --> 15:04.083
"Always?"
This has happened before?

15:09.625 --> 15:11.083
Lyta.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.500
When I interned
with the Psi Corps..

15:16.583 --> 15:18.875
...there were
a number of murders.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.500
Someone was killing
commercial telepaths.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.167
And the mundanes didn't care.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.500
For them, it was just
one less teep to worry about.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.833
So the Psi Corps
took care of it.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.792
What'd you do?

15:33.875 --> 15:35.542
What we had to.

15:35.625 --> 15:38.167
We scanned anyone
who might've had a lead.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.667
No warrant, no permission

15:40.750 --> 15:42.500
and no trace.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.500
Just gaps in their memory

15:44.583 --> 15:46.917
missing hours, headaches.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.458
Did you find him?

15:52.292 --> 15:55.042
- Did you, uh..
- No.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.667
That would have been too quick.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.458
And we couldn't go to the police
because we didn't wanna

15:59.542 --> 16:01.792
explain how we found him.

16:04.125 --> 16:07.208
Somewhere on
Beta Colony there is..

16:07.292 --> 16:09.875
...an institution.

16:09.958 --> 16:13.500
In one room of that
institution there is a man..

16:13.583 --> 16:16.667
...who spends his days
and nights screaming at..

16:16.750 --> 16:19.167
...things only he can see.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.083
Things we planted in his mind.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.000
They have to keep him in
a straitjacket 24 hours a day

16:28.083 --> 16:30.542
or he'd claw his own eyes out

16:30.625 --> 16:32.917
just to make it stop.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.417
My God.

16:38.583 --> 16:42.667
When it was over, I-I
transferred to commercial work.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.417
I wanted out.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.375
The Corps took me in
when I was just a few years old.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.583
They taught me
what a telepath was.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.000
What we could do.

16:58.500 --> 17:02.292
And all that time I'd never
been afraid of who we were.

17:03.833 --> 17:06.292
Until that day.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.458
When we did what we had to do
because no one else would.

17:15.417 --> 17:16.750
Someday there's gonna be a war

17:16.833 --> 17:19.458
between telepaths
and mundanes, Stephen.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.292
I just hope
I don't live to see it.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.833
Maybe, uh..

17:29.375 --> 17:31.708
Maybe after the captain
takes care of President Clark

17:31.792 --> 17:33.833
we're gonna work
on this, okay?

17:33.917 --> 17:36.042
We're gonna, we're gonna
build some bridges

17:36.125 --> 17:40.250
a-and then find a more positive
way of dealing with the Corps.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.417
You're going to
have a long wait.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.417
We just received
a coded message from Babylon 5.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.458
It's about Sheridan.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.083
I hope he told you what to do
with those frozen telepaths

17:50.167 --> 17:53.042
'cause it looks like
you're on your own for a while.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.792
Delenn. Lennier.
I'm glad to see you.

18:08.875 --> 18:09.833
I was just about to leave.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.417
It's good to be back, commander.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.667
- Is there a problem?
- I'm afraid so.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.542
President Clark's people
have found John's father.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.083
They're holding him captive.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.500
Mr. Garibaldi thinks
he can help.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.000
The captain's en route
right now.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.750
He wants me to take over
the fleet in his absence.

18:21.833 --> 18:23.167
I was hoping you can
keep an eye on things

18:23.250 --> 18:24.375
around here until I get back.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.458
Of course.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.458
We'll do everything we can.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.667
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

18:31.708 --> 18:34.042
Do you think
the captain's alright?

18:34.125 --> 18:36.458
He knows what he's doing.
He'll be fine.

18:36.542 --> 18:39.708
Assuming Mr. Garibaldi
can still be trusted.

Well, just that he's being held

He's not being
heavily guarded right now

But it'll take them
a while to regroup

24:36.750 --> 24:38.167
He's trivial.

24:38.250 --> 24:40.875
In one way or another
he'll be gone in a few years.

24:40.958 --> 24:44.292
But the telepaths
he put in power, the Psi Corps

24:44.375 --> 24:46.375
those will be with us forever.

24:46.458 --> 24:48.708
That's the real danger.

24:48.792 --> 24:50.750
If information is power

24:50.833 --> 24:53.083
then telepaths represent
the greatest threat

24:53.167 --> 24:54.917
to freedom we've ever seen.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.125
We have to deal with that

24:58.208 --> 25:00.250
or face the very
real possibility

25:00.333 --> 25:02.458
of our own extinction.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.458
The danger before us
is nothing less

25:07.542 --> 25:10.625
than the death of human liberty
and human thought.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.458
Do you recognize this?

25:19.083 --> 25:20.250
Yeah.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.333
Yeah, that's the package
I helped Wade smuggle

25:23.417 --> 25:25.833
past customs on Babylon 5.

25:25.917 --> 25:27.250
Lise said it was
a cure for telepaths

25:27.333 --> 25:29.958
against some kind
of genetic mutation.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.917
Lise. A very good woman.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.917
She believes me
when I tell her these things

25:34.000 --> 25:36.750
but, uh, lately..

25:36.833 --> 25:38.667
...I couldn't tell her
the truth because I knew

25:38.750 --> 25:41.750
that the Psi Corps
were after this.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.083
They don't know what's going on

25:43.167 --> 25:44.958
but they do know
enough to be worried.

25:45.042 --> 25:47.625
And that's the reason
why you didn't come yourself

25:47.708 --> 25:49.458
and why you had me fire Lyta.

25:49.542 --> 25:52.875
Any telepath is
a potential risk to my work.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.167
If they knew for certain
what was going on

25:55.250 --> 25:58.083
I'd be dead in five minutes.

25:58.167 --> 26:01.958
This vial does contain
a cure, Mr. Garibaldi.

26:02.042 --> 26:04.958
It took my people
three years to develop it.

26:06.500 --> 26:10.542
Almost as long as it took us
to develop the virus itself.

26:12.042 --> 26:15.583
This virus is encoded
to embed itself in the gene

26:15.667 --> 26:18.958
that activates
a telepath's abilities.

26:19.042 --> 26:23.208
It's airborne,
100 percent contagious

26:23.292 --> 26:25.167
and utterly harmless
to normals.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.000
Only telepaths are susceptible.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.583
Once infected,
they have to receive

26:29.667 --> 26:31.917
injections of the
antidote every two weeks.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.333
If they miss
even one injection..

26:34.417 --> 26:35.792
They die.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.792
And your people and the
government control the antidote.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.292
It's insurance against the day

26:40.375 --> 26:42.333
when they try to do to us
what we've done to them.

26:42.417 --> 26:44.667
Turn us into
second-class citizens.

26:44.750 --> 26:48.333
If they try it
we simply withhold the antidote.

26:48.417 --> 26:52.292
And the net result is you
create a slave race to serve..

26:53.375 --> 26:54.958
...or die.

26:55.042 --> 26:57.375
(Wade)
It's the tyranny of evolution.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.792
Sooner or later,
you have a species

26:59.875 --> 27:03.333
that will have a genetic
or technological advantage

27:03.417 --> 27:06.000
and that species
will always conquer

27:06.083 --> 27:07.958
species without that advantage.

27:08.042 --> 27:10.667
Carthage, the triumph
of the Homo-sapiens

27:10.750 --> 27:12.917
over the Neanderthal
showed us that.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.542
Now what do we have?

27:14.625 --> 27:17.750
We have Homo-superior
versus Homo-sapien.

27:17.833 --> 27:19.583
On a level playing field

27:19.667 --> 27:21.625
Homo-superior wins every time.

27:23.083 --> 27:24.583
Unless we cheat.

27:26.458 --> 27:27.875
I turned this company into

27:27.958 --> 27:31.667
one of the biggest medical
research facilities in existence

27:31.750 --> 27:35.125
because I wanted
to help people, not harm them.

27:35.208 --> 27:37.458
But I won't stand by
and let telepaths

27:37.542 --> 27:39.208
turn into a ruling class!

27:41.792 --> 27:46.542
So, first we remove that danger.

27:46.625 --> 27:49.500
Then we'll deal
with President Clark.

27:49.583 --> 27:52.750
Telepaths are his power base.

27:53.875 --> 27:55.417
Neutralize them,
and you take away

27:55.500 --> 27:58.542
the instrument
of terror he's used..

27:58.625 --> 28:01.750
...to suppress
and intimidate others.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.875
Does any of this

28:03.958 --> 28:06.917
pose a problem for you,
Mr. Garibaldi?

28:08.500 --> 28:11.250
No. No, it doesn't.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.583
I think
what you're doing is right.

28:12.667 --> 28:15.208
Telepaths have
an unfair advantage.

28:15.292 --> 28:16.500
I think it's right
that we make

28:16.583 --> 28:18.292
an advantage of our own
in return.

28:19.417 --> 28:20.833
Exactly.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.458
I am very tired.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.667
It's been a long day.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.750
But we made a good beginning.

28:30.833 --> 28:32.708
With Sheridan out of the way

28:32.792 --> 28:35.333
Clark will relax and..

28:35.417 --> 28:39.458
...I expect we can start moving
the virus out in a few days.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.500
Three weeks after that,
according to our projections

28:42.583 --> 28:45.208
of the infection rate..

28:45.292 --> 28:47.375
...the telepath prob..

28:50.208 --> 28:52.333
The telepath problem..

28:54.250 --> 28:56.333
...will finally be over.

29:02.375 --> 29:04.875
Now that you know, you'll have
to stay on the compound

29:04.958 --> 29:07.625
until the virus
starts moving out.

29:07.708 --> 29:10.125
I'm sure you can understand
the danger.

29:14.625 --> 29:17.125
[instrumental music]

30:19.583 --> 30:21.750
Michael.

30:21.833 --> 30:23.792
I heard what Bill told you.

30:23.875 --> 30:26.625
I-I can't go back there,
not now.

30:26.708 --> 30:27.875
'You gotta help me stop him.'

30:27.958 --> 30:29.667
What he's doing, I understand

30:29.750 --> 30:32.708
why he's doing it,
but it's wrong.

30:32.792 --> 30:35.042
I've felt that something
was going on for a while

30:35.125 --> 30:37.167
but I had no idea.

30:38.625 --> 30:40.625
(Lise)
'Michael?'

30:40.708 --> 30:42.583
'Michael,
are you listening to me?'

30:42.667 --> 30:44.667
'You've gotta do something.'

30:44.750 --> 30:47.417
You have to leave here.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.292
- But I--
- Now!

30:50.667 --> 30:52.417
But what am I going to do?

30:52.500 --> 30:54.000
Go home.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.958
[door closes]

31:15.042 --> 31:17.667
Hello, Mr. Garibaldi.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.583
I received your signal.

31:20.667 --> 31:23.083
Now, tell me what you know.

31:24.542 --> 31:25.958
All of it.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.958
This virus is encoded
to embed itself

31:39.042 --> 31:43.167
in the gene that activates
a telepath's abilities.

31:43.250 --> 31:47.292
It's airborne,
100 percent contagious

31:47.375 --> 31:50.583
and utterly harmless to normals.

31:50.667 --> 31:53.125
Once infected,
they have to receive injections

31:53.208 --> 31:54.542
of the antidote every two weeks.

31:56.083 --> 31:59.542
If they miss
even one injection..

31:59.625 --> 32:00.833
They die.

32:03.542 --> 32:05.750
Well..

32:05.833 --> 32:09.167
Thank you. Not that
you had much choice.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.833
I knew there were forces
out there with plans

32:13.917 --> 32:16.375
for my telepaths but this..

32:18.000 --> 32:19.833
I had no idea.

32:21.125 --> 32:22.917
The sheer scope of it.

32:24.875 --> 32:29.167
Well, we'll stop it now,
of course.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.667
In our own way.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.667
(Bester)
'I can feel you, you know.'

32:34.750 --> 32:36.667
'The real you.'

32:36.750 --> 32:39.542
Beating at the inside
of your skull

32:39.625 --> 32:42.250
screaming to get out

32:42.333 --> 32:44.750
to know what's going on.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.375
For a long time,
I've been debating

32:48.458 --> 32:51.500
what to do when this day came.

32:51.583 --> 32:54.500
Do I let you know
what happened to you

32:54.583 --> 32:57.167
or do I leave you like this..

32:57.250 --> 33:01.250
(Bester)
'...trapped in a prison
of meat and flesh and bone..'

33:01.333 --> 33:02.625
'...forever?'

33:04.708 --> 33:08.708
I've decided to be magnanimous,
Mr. Garibaldi.

33:08.792 --> 33:11.125
Not that you'll appreciate it.

33:11.208 --> 33:14.833
Because you have prevented
a new holocaust..

33:14.917 --> 33:19.917
...the enslavement and murder
of several million telepaths.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.125
Though I doubt very much
you'll appreciate that, either.

33:27.708 --> 33:30.750
Go back, Mr. Garibaldi.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.583
Go back..

33:32.667 --> 33:34.750
And remember.

33:34.833 --> 33:37.625
Movin' into position.
Everybody hang tight.

33:37.708 --> 33:40.250
(Bester)
The Shadows
had come to Babylon 5

33:40.333 --> 33:42.583
and Sheridan
had gone to Z'Ha'Dum.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.667
So why don't you just kill me?

33:44.750 --> 33:45.875
It doesn't work.

33:45.958 --> 33:48.250
Somebody'd just come
around and replace you.

33:48.333 --> 33:50.750
(Bester)
They knew there were three
people who could replace him

33:50.833 --> 33:53.667
Delenn, Ivanova and you.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.833
Given your
checkered background..

33:56.917 --> 33:58.375
...they thought
you would be the easiest

33:58.458 --> 34:00.125
to turn to their side.

34:00.208 --> 34:01.417
What the hell?

34:01.500 --> 34:02.958
(Bester)
Once Sheridan was dead

34:03.042 --> 34:06.167
Ivanova and Delenn
would be eliminated.

34:06.250 --> 34:08.083
They left the station intact

34:08.167 --> 34:11.250
on the theory that it could be
used for their purposes.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.958
And you,
they took back with them

34:14.042 --> 34:17.292
to...adjust you.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.625
By this time I knew they
had infiltrated the Corps.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.875
So when they pulled in
some of my people

34:21.958 --> 34:24.542
to help in your adjustment

34:24.625 --> 34:26.500
I was able to intervene.

34:26.583 --> 34:29.792
Not so much on your behalf
as my own.

34:29.875 --> 34:33.458
This virus that kills
only telepaths..

34:33.542 --> 34:36.667
...I'd bet good money
it's Shadow technology.

34:36.750 --> 34:39.583
They probably got it to him
through third parties

34:39.667 --> 34:42.750
helped his people
work out the details.

34:42.833 --> 34:47.167
We both know that telepaths
were a threat to the Shadows

34:47.250 --> 34:50.250
one they wouldn't mind
eliminating.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.417
It's ingenious, really.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.833
They played Clark's drive
for power on one side

34:55.917 --> 34:58.792
and Edgar's fear
of telepaths on the other

34:58.875 --> 35:01.292
leaving us in the middle.

35:01.375 --> 35:04.667
Controlled or dead.

35:06.208 --> 35:07.958
But let's get back to you.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.875
(Bester)
I arranged to have
you rerouted

35:11.958 --> 35:15.083
to our research facility
here on Mars.

35:15.167 --> 35:16.917
Then we got to work.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.667
Alright, I want
a complete neural workup.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.833
I wanna know all the soft
points where we can go in

35:24.917 --> 35:27.167
without disturbing
the neural landscape.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.667
We can't leave any fingerprints.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.708
He may have to pass
a telepathic scan.

35:31.792 --> 35:34.708
You don't want us to do
a full reprogram on him?

35:34.792 --> 35:36.375
Unnecessary.

35:36.458 --> 35:38.708
By nature, Mr. Garibaldi
is rebellious

35:38.792 --> 35:41.375
stubborn, and suspicious.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.417
He has an innate distrust
of authority figures.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.833
'And he's very good at
figuring out when a conspiracy'

35:46.917 --> 35:50.750
is taking place and tracking
it back to its source.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.542
We need that part of him.

35:54.625 --> 35:57.417
So I don't wanna risk
tampering with it.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.250
We don't have to reprogram him

36:04.333 --> 36:07.125
just accentuate
his natural instincts.

36:07.208 --> 36:10.333
More rebellious,
more stubborn, more suspicious

36:10.417 --> 36:12.417
of his fellow officers.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.750
Then all we have to do
is nudge him

36:14.833 --> 36:18.000
in the right direction
from time to time

36:18.083 --> 36:21.333
and let nature run its course.

36:21.417 --> 36:23.250
(Bester)
After we finished,
we had to make sure

36:23.333 --> 36:26.458
that you didn't remember
anything we had done to you.

36:26.542 --> 36:28.042
That was the hard part.

36:28.125 --> 36:31.833
We were, shall we say,
less than gentle.

36:31.917 --> 36:36.250
I said I don't remember
anything! Nothing!

36:36.333 --> 36:37.917
(Bester)
Once we felt it was safe

36:38.000 --> 36:39.667
we put enough
information out there

36:39.750 --> 36:41.625
to let your people find you.

36:41.708 --> 36:44.458
After that,
all we could do was wait

36:44.542 --> 36:46.333
and hope for the best.

36:46.417 --> 36:49.625
It worked even better
than I could have imagined.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.458
You resigned your position,
something I hadn't expected.

36:53.542 --> 36:56.083
But it put you in the perfect
position to be recruited

36:56.167 --> 36:57.708
by William Edgars

36:57.792 --> 37:00.792
and it isolated you from
the people who cared about you

37:00.875 --> 37:02.375
and might try to help you.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.125
I've decided to resign
as head of security

37:04.208 --> 37:05.542
effective immediately.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.333
(Bester)
From time to time, we updated

37:07.417 --> 37:09.958
your conditioning
continued to point you

37:10.042 --> 37:11.667
where we needed you to go.

37:11.750 --> 37:15.542
Until, in the end,
the old Garibaldi was gone

37:15.625 --> 37:20.125
and the new one
worked only for us.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.875
You would do anything to find
what we wanted you to find

37:23.958 --> 37:26.292
even sell out Sheridan.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.167
Your final orders
were to report back

37:28.250 --> 37:31.000
when you had
all the information we needed.

37:31.083 --> 37:35.167
So, now the question becomes

37:35.250 --> 37:39.042
'what do I do with you now that
I have no further use for you?'

37:40.792 --> 37:43.167
I could kill you, I suppose.

37:43.250 --> 37:47.000
In some ways,
it might be a mercy.

37:47.083 --> 37:50.333
By now your friends know
that you betrayed Sheridan.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.750
So, as the saying goes

37:54.833 --> 37:57.083
you can't go home again.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.792
And your current employer

37:58.875 --> 38:01.708
is not gonna be
around much longer.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.500
Or..

38:06.583 --> 38:09.042
I could leave you
just like this..

38:09.125 --> 38:11.208
...forever.

38:11.292 --> 38:13.833
Whatever you think of me,
Mr. Garibaldi

38:13.917 --> 38:17.250
I'm not capricious or cruel.

38:18.625 --> 38:21.958
I used you
because I had no other choice.

38:22.042 --> 38:23.750
I have what I want.

38:24.792 --> 38:27.833
My interest in you is over.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.042
[tone chimes]

38:31.875 --> 38:33.917
We'll be docking in a moment.

38:41.083 --> 38:44.250
I've just sent the all-clear
signal telepathically.

38:44.333 --> 38:47.667
After I'm gone,
you'll be able to move again.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.458
You'll remember it all.

38:50.542 --> 38:53.375
You'll be yourself again.

38:53.458 --> 38:57.000
You can try to tell
the others what happened..

38:57.083 --> 38:59.375
...but under the circumstances

38:59.458 --> 39:02.292
I doubt very much
anyone will believe you.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.708
Be seeing you, Mr. Garibaldi.

39:10.833 --> 39:13.333
[instrumental music]

39:38.542 --> 39:41.000
No!

39:55.042 --> 39:57.875
Did you get through?
Is it true?

39:57.958 --> 40:00.042
They've got the captain,
alright.

40:00.125 --> 40:01.292
It was a setup..

40:01.375 --> 40:03.250
And Garibaldi was behind
the whole thing.

40:03.333 --> 40:05.625
(Marcus)
'I just heard he's tried
to contact Babylon 5.'

40:05.708 --> 40:07.625
You tell Corwin
to refuse his signals.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.167
There's nothing that
he has to say to me right now

40:09.250 --> 40:12.167
that I have the slightest
interest in hearing.

40:12.250 --> 40:16.125
And you tell them that
if he turns up on the station

40:16.208 --> 40:18.833
I want that
son-of-a-bitch shot on sight.

40:20.125 --> 40:22.000
- Susan.
- I mean it.

40:25.208 --> 40:27.042
What's our status?

40:27.125 --> 40:30.833
The other ships want to know
what we're going to do now.

40:30.917 --> 40:32.583
We finish what we started.

40:32.667 --> 40:34.958
If Clark thinks
this is gonna slow us down

40:35.042 --> 40:37.958
he's in for a very big surprise.

40:38.042 --> 40:39.958
The captain once told me

40:40.042 --> 40:42.833
"The person is expendable,
the job is not."

40:44.250 --> 40:45.958
We keep going.

40:51.333 --> 40:53.792
(Garibaldi)
'Lise! Lise!'

41:02.750 --> 41:04.750
[panting]

41:12.458 --> 41:13.667
Lise?

41:14.458 --> 41:15.625
Lise!

41:16.833 --> 41:18.083
'Lise?'

41:24.833 --> 41:26.625
[groaning]

41:28.292 --> 41:29.375
Wade.

41:30.458 --> 41:31.458
Wade.

41:31.542 --> 41:32.833
Wade, what happened?

41:33.500 --> 41:35.208
Five of them.

41:35.292 --> 41:36.792
Hit us outta nowhere.

41:38.208 --> 41:39.542
They knew.

41:39.625 --> 41:40.917
Where's Lise?

41:41.792 --> 41:43.292
'Where?'

41:43.375 --> 41:44.792
I don't know. She wasn't here.

41:44.875 --> 41:47.792
She was gone
when they got here.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.625
She..

41:52.000 --> 41:53.625
Wade?

41:58.583 --> 42:01.458
[panting]

42:04.875 --> 42:06.125
Oh, dammit.

42:07.417 --> 42:09.250
(Alison)
'This is Alison Higgins
with an update'

42:09.333 --> 42:11.250
on our earlier stories.

42:11.333 --> 42:13.125
President Clark declared today

42:13.208 --> 42:15.458
a day of celebration and rest

42:15.542 --> 42:18.375
noting that the capture
of renegade Earthforce captain

42:18.458 --> 42:20.083
John Sheridan signals that

42:20.167 --> 42:23.250
the war of aggression
against Earth is unraveling.

42:23.333 --> 42:27.125
Sheridan continues to be
well-fed and well-treated.

42:27.208 --> 42:29.958
Now that he has been freed
of alien influences

42:30.042 --> 42:33.625
he has reportedly indicated
feelings of remorse and regret

42:33.708 --> 42:36.458
for his actions
against his own Homeworld.

42:36.542 --> 42:39.042
We hope to have more
on this soon.

42:39.125 --> 42:41.125
In other news, William Edgars

42:41.208 --> 42:43.042
founder of Edgars Industries

42:43.125 --> 42:46.292
one of earth's ten largest
medical research corporations

42:46.375 --> 42:48.292
was found dead
this morning along with

42:48.375 --> 42:50.292
at least one of his staff.

42:50.375 --> 42:53.792
Two personal bodyguards outside
the estate were also killed.

42:53.875 --> 42:56.292
Preliminary reports from
investigators on the scene

42:56.375 --> 42:59.708
indicate that the resistance
may have been responsible

42:59.792 --> 43:03.292
for the attack as they continue
their assault against business

43:03.375 --> 43:04.792
and political targets.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.458
Nothing is known
yet concerning

43:06.542 --> 43:09.208
the whereabouts
of his wife, Lise Edgars.

43:09.292 --> 43:12.167
Finally, ISN sources
within Earthdome

43:12.250 --> 43:14.458
have indicated
that Captain Sheridan

43:14.542 --> 43:17.833
may have been turned in by
his own former head of security

43:17.917 --> 43:20.583
Chief Warrant Officer
Michael Garibaldi.

43:20.667 --> 43:22.750
If this is true, we at ISN

43:22.833 --> 43:26.167
want to convey our personal
thanks and gratitude

43:26.250 --> 43:28.792
to a true hero of the people.

43:34.917 --> 43:36.750
