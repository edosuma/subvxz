from the studio

04:06.076 --> 04:08.078

04:08.078 --> 04:10.461
so we're having an emergency
Bizaardvark meeting.

Hey... Bizaardvark!

04:19.510 --> 04:20.591
No.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.683
Your office is the only place
we could think of

04:22.683 --> 04:24.725
where no one would bother us
on account of the rats

04:24.725 --> 04:26.347
and, you know,
everything else.

04:26.347 --> 04:28.939
Well, I'm here now
and I'm ready to help.

04:28.939 --> 04:32.393
Time for the Bernie Schotz
big File of Fixes.

04:33.694 --> 04:36.026

to every problem

04:38.659 --> 04:40.280
Bizaardvark might run into.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.903

in here on pyro.

04:42.903 --> 04:44.745
Pancakes.

04:44.745 --> 04:46.166
Piranhas.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.748
Prescription deodorant--

04:47.748 --> 04:49.960
Oh, that one's for me.

04:51.211 --> 04:52.543
Pyro! Here it is.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.585
Bernie, really,
we don't need your help.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.256
-We got this.
-You're right.

04:56.256 --> 04:58.339
I should just go talk
to Liam directly

04:58.339 --> 04:59.680
and smooth
this whole thing over.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.921
No!

05:00.921 --> 05:02.843
I mean-- No!

05:02.843 --> 05:05.516
Bernie, please
don't talk to Liam.

05:05.516 --> 05:07.227
You've done it a hundred times
and it's never worked.

05:07.227 --> 05:10.351
So, what you're saying is...

05:10.351 --> 05:12.523
I'm due.

05:12.523 --> 05:14.104
What she's saying is

05:14.104 --> 05:16.817
not everyone around here
takes you seriously.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.739
What do you mean?

05:18.739 --> 05:20.531
Well, you don't make videos,

05:20.531 --> 05:22.202
your office is in a closet...

05:22.202 --> 05:24.284
Don't forget that whole
prescription deodorant thing.

05:25.946 --> 05:27.408
Oh.

05:27.408 --> 05:29.500
You guys take me
seriously though, right?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.831
Of course we do.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.042
Yeah, I figured.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.632
All right, let's get
this meeting started.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.725
All:
Hey... Bizaardvark!

05:44.725 --> 05:46.597
Bizaardvark!

05:46.597 --> 05:48.469
Aw.

05:48.469 --> 05:49.890
I'll get you guys next time.

05:54.565 --> 05:57.187
(laughing)
Oh, that's so funny! Oh, oh!

05:57.187 --> 05:58.649
(laughing)

05:58.649 --> 06:00.941
And Amelia enters!

06:02.192 --> 06:05.325
And Amelia enters
and everyone looks up!

06:06.867 --> 06:10.330
Sorry. I was just watching
Horse Face Guy's new Gliiink.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.702
-Do you Gliiink?
-(gasps)

06:11.702 --> 06:13.914
I'm a lady.

06:13.914 --> 06:17.257
Even if I did,
I wouldn't admit it.

06:17.257 --> 06:20.631
Gliiink. It's a new app where
you share one-second videos.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.053
Everyone's on it--
me, Horse Face Guy,

06:23.053 --> 06:24.765
your friends
Paige and Frankie...

06:24.765 --> 06:26.597
(singing)

06:26.597 --> 06:28.098
(both gurgling)

06:28.098 --> 06:30.471
Both:
Wow!

06:31.722 --> 06:34.975
I'm surprised someone as hip
as you doesn't know about it.

06:34.975 --> 06:36.316
I mean, it's been
the hottest app

06:36.316 --> 06:38.899
for like three days now.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.652
I know about Gloink.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.694
-It's Gliiink.
-That's what I said.

06:43.694 --> 06:47.117
With my accent, it's impossible
for me to say "Gliiink."

06:47.117 --> 06:49.790
-But you just said--
-Fear not,

06:49.790 --> 06:51.081
fellow Vuuuglers.

06:51.081 --> 06:53.584
While there may be
a social media platform

06:53.584 --> 06:55.746
I have temporarily
not conquered,

06:55.746 --> 06:57.588
it is only a matter of time

06:57.588 --> 06:59.129
before I master this app

06:59.129 --> 07:02.843
and become queen
of the Gliiinkosphere!

07:04.044 --> 07:06.597
How did I get up
on this table?

07:08.889 --> 07:10.681
Well, I have
 a vacation planned.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.142
What do you mean
 you can't fill in for me?

07:13.223 --> 07:16.186
What, do you have
 Taylor Swift tickets?

07:17.357 --> 07:18.729
You do.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.940
Do you have any extra?

07:21.361 --> 07:24.565
I thought you handled
that beautifully.

07:24.565 --> 07:25.776
Ugh.

07:25.776 --> 07:28.328
How I needed that vacay.

07:28.328 --> 07:31.742

Can't you find someone else
to cover for you?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.381
Not this last minute.

07:41.381 --> 07:43.003
It's not easy
 to run this place.

07:43.003 --> 07:46.927
Everyone expects you
 to make the big decisions
 under pressure.

07:46.927 --> 07:49.219
They respect you.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.642
Respect you.

07:51.642 --> 07:52.853
Respect you.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.555
Respect you.

07:54.555 --> 07:57.187
Sorry, I think
 my monitor just glitched out

07:57.187 --> 07:59.479
and repeated "respect you"
 over and over.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.152
Was that weird or what?

08:02.152 --> 08:06.697
Liam, how about I run Vuuugle
while you go on vacation?

08:06.697 --> 08:08.488
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.991

08:12.993 --> 08:14.825

 no qualifications,

08:14.825 --> 08:18.749
on the other hand... Maui.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.832
If it helps, I once
babysat my neighbor's cat

08:21.832 --> 08:26.126

another 'U' to Vuuugle.

08:36.135 --> 08:38.438

Yeah. He actually
listens to people.

10:00.931 --> 10:03.223
Do you have an idea?
He wants to hear it.

10:03.223 --> 10:06.897

10:16.446 --> 10:18.618
He should be helping
"us" people.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.080
Let's go get
our studio time back.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.002
-What if he says no?
-It's Bernie.

10:22.002 --> 10:23.293
We just shower him
with compliments.

10:23.293 --> 10:25.455
Okay, but let's not
take advantage of the fact

10:25.455 --> 10:26.456
that we're his friends.

10:28.508 --> 10:31.051
Friends of the boss
coming through!

10:31.051 --> 10:32.803
Automatic cutsies!

10:34.174 --> 10:36.927
Next time someone gets
on your back, you tell me.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.059
Seriously.
That shouldn't be happening.

10:39.059 --> 10:41.181
You're not a real horse.

10:41.181 --> 10:42.182
You're a guy.

10:45.726 --> 10:47.227
Amelia, sweetheart,

10:47.227 --> 10:48.648
come in.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.072
Bernie, if I'm gonna become
queen of the Gliiinkosphere,

10:52.072 --> 10:54.905
then Vuuugle needs to buy me
this new lighting package.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.778
It's only $75,000.

10:57.778 --> 11:00.240
I'll tell you what,
I can't do that,

11:00.240 --> 11:03.663
but I can give you
this compliment:

11:03.663 --> 11:08.048
Amelia, you glow enough
just being you.

11:09.129 --> 11:11.091
That's really all I needed.

11:11.091 --> 11:13.593
Hey, just because I'm your boss

11:13.593 --> 11:15.796
doesn't mean we can't date.

11:15.796 --> 11:16.967
What?

11:16.967 --> 11:20.010
I said I'll look into
the lighting package.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.805
She'll come around.

11:26.516 --> 11:27.728
(number machine chimes)

11:27.728 --> 11:29.439
Forty-two!

11:30.690 --> 11:32.402
Forty-two!

11:34.364 --> 11:35.405
(number machine chimes)

11:35.405 --> 11:37.577
Forty-three!

11:39.449 --> 11:41.031
Hey, Mr. Schotz.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.033
Please, call me Boss.

11:43.033 --> 11:43.994
Bup-bup-bup!

11:45.705 --> 11:47.788
We were thinking
you could, uh,

11:47.788 --> 11:49.129
hook us up
with some perks.

11:49.129 --> 11:52.422
Sure. I mean, as long
as it doesn't break
any of Liam's rules.

11:52.422 --> 11:55.175
I'm taking
the job seriously and...

11:55.175 --> 11:57.007
people are taking
me seriously.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.598
Why wouldn't they?

11:58.598 --> 12:00.430
You're a smart, smart man.

12:00.430 --> 12:03.053
Now, I wish we could make
a video about how smart you are,

12:03.053 --> 12:07.437
but, you know,
Liam put us on probation.

12:07.437 --> 12:09.439
Both:
Aww!

12:10.851 --> 12:12.062
Hey, I have an idea!

12:12.062 --> 12:14.444
-You do?
-I'm the boss now.

12:14.444 --> 12:16.156
Probation over.

12:16.156 --> 12:19.119
(screaming)

12:19.119 --> 12:20.991
You did not just do that!

12:20.991 --> 12:23.363
Yes, he did!
Yes, he did!

12:23.363 --> 12:25.205
I did just do that.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.040
Now, if only we could get
those high-speed cameras.

12:31.541 --> 12:32.833
Well, I guess I--

12:32.833 --> 12:35.085
(screaming)

12:35.085 --> 12:36.466
How do you do it?

12:36.466 --> 12:39.639
-Oh!
-How do you do it?

12:39.639 --> 12:42.052
Well, I'm the boss, I guess.

12:44.144 --> 12:47.517
Yeah, it's just too bad
the big studio is taken
all week, 'cause...

12:47.517 --> 12:50.100
that's the one
we could really use.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.152
(sighs)
Yeah, that's too bad.

12:57.447 --> 12:59.449
Except you're the boss...

12:59.449 --> 13:01.361
Mm-hmm.

13:01.361 --> 13:03.994
...and can get us...

13:03.994 --> 13:06.246
Mm-hmm.

13:06.246 --> 13:09.169
...the big stu...

13:09.169 --> 13:11.291
-Dio!
-The big studio?!

13:11.291 --> 13:14.334
(screaming)

13:14.334 --> 13:16.416
Oh, what a great idea!

13:16.416 --> 13:18.839
Bernie, you are
a true hero!

13:18.839 --> 13:21.551
By the way,
did I ever tell you

13:21.551 --> 13:23.553
-how manly you look
in that jacket?
-Mm-hmm.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.886
Well, this is a medium.

13:29.189 --> 13:30.640
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

13:32.392 --> 13:35.395
Thanks for agreeing to be
my Gliiink coach, Marge.

13:35.395 --> 13:38.278
Well, actually, I gotta
pick my boyfriend up
from the hospital--

13:38.278 --> 13:39.609
For my first Gliiink,

13:39.609 --> 13:41.491
I thought I'd tell
the Gliiinkosphere

13:41.491 --> 13:43.073
a little about myself.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.205
When I start talking,
you start recording.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.947
I guess he could take a taxi.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.911
-Hi, I'm--
-(camera beeps)

13:50.911 --> 13:52.162
Time's up.

13:53.373 --> 13:54.794
Let's try this again.

13:54.794 --> 13:57.257
-And now for the story of--
-(camera beeps)

13:57.257 --> 13:59.129
Wow, that's fast.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.302
You only get
one second, sweetie.

14:02.302 --> 14:03.924
You know what might help?

14:03.924 --> 14:07.227
In your brain,
count to one.

14:07.227 --> 14:09.179
That sounds easy,

14:09.179 --> 14:11.311
but nothing I say
is one second.

14:11.311 --> 14:13.433
I mean, even when
I say hi, it's still

14:13.433 --> 14:15.475
-hey!
-(camera beeps)

14:15.475 --> 14:17.357
Well, beep you!

14:21.191 --> 14:23.823
Thanks for coming back to
help us finish our video,
Pyro Steve.

14:23.823 --> 14:25.035
You're lucky you got me.

14:25.035 --> 14:26.156
I've been busy.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.537
I took a cooking class

14:27.537 --> 14:29.619
and I started
working on my memoirs.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.752
Ha! I'm just messin' with ya.

14:32.752 --> 14:35.295
I've been blowin' stuff up.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.337
Seriously, where did
you find this guy?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.550
Hey, ladies!

14:40.550 --> 14:42.882
Whoa, it just got
smarter in here.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.465
Love that green shirt.

14:47.307 --> 14:48.848
Hey, is that pyro?

14:49.849 --> 14:52.312
Even better:
Pyro on pyro.

14:52.312 --> 14:54.514
Just a heads up,
this explosion

14:54.514 --> 14:56.566
is much more suited
to an open field

14:56.566 --> 14:58.818
or an already
burned-out city.

14:58.818 --> 15:01.861
But we can make it work.

15:01.861 --> 15:04.404
Liam left me clear instructions.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.735
No pyro allowed.

15:05.735 --> 15:10.030
It's right here
between "Don't call me"
and "Feed the fish."

15:11.831 --> 15:13.123
Oh shoot.

15:14.244 --> 15:16.586
But you're not Liam.
You're our friend.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.918
-Let's do this, Pyro Steve!
-No!

15:18.918 --> 15:22.302
No pyro.
Rules are rules.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.045
You're right. Sorry.

15:25.045 --> 15:27.807
You're a smart
and very effective boss.

15:27.807 --> 15:29.179
Thank you.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.221
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to go tape

15:31.221 --> 15:33.433
some googly eyes
on a bunch of dead fish.

15:36.726 --> 15:39.939
With a tear in my eye,
I'm shuttin' it down.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.192
What? No, start the countdown.

15:42.192 --> 15:46.026
-But the boss man--
-Don't worry about it.
That was just Bernie.

15:46.026 --> 15:49.159
Frankie:
Just toss him a few compliments
and we can do whatever we want.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.533
Now let's blow
that thing up.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.875
Mama want big boom!

15:57.917 --> 16:00.290
-(Frankie and Paige laugh)
-Pyro Steve: Nailed it!

16:00.290 --> 16:03.383
-Mama like big boom!
-(all laugh)

16:03.383 --> 16:06.176
(all laugh and cheer)

16:08.848 --> 16:10.220
(lively chattering)

16:16.306 --> 16:17.897
What is going on?

16:17.897 --> 16:20.360
This place is out of control.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.811
Marge, what happened?

16:21.811 --> 16:25.525
So things got a little weird.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.407
Where's Bernie?

16:27.407 --> 16:28.608
He's supposed to be in charge.

16:28.608 --> 16:31.031
I don't know.
He seemed awfully upset,

16:31.031 --> 16:32.612
and then he did mention
your two names

16:32.612 --> 16:33.823
and that's all I heard.

16:33.823 --> 16:36.956
Now please, tell the king
of Furniture Mountain

16:36.956 --> 16:38.418
to grant me my freedom!

16:40.080 --> 16:43.123
Seems like a merciful leader.
I'm sure he'll listen to reason.

16:46.216 --> 16:49.469
Excuse me.
Gliiinking in progress.

16:49.469 --> 16:50.930
-Hair toss.
-(camera beeps)

16:50.930 --> 16:52.132
-Hair fluff.
-(camera beeps)

16:52.132 --> 16:53.593
-Hair flip.
-(camera beeps)

16:53.593 --> 16:56.136
-Hair toss,
hair fluff, hair flip!
-(camera beeps)

16:58.478 --> 17:00.520
(chuckling)

17:00.520 --> 17:02.982
Oh, these are gonna
blow up real nice!

17:02.982 --> 17:04.854
Pa-pow!

17:06.000 --> 17:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:13.413 --> 17:15.454
I can't believe Bernie quit.

17:15.454 --> 17:18.248
I can't believe the boss has
been away for five minutes

17:18.248 --> 17:20.210
and everyone's
losing their minds.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.461
Right, Frankie?

17:21.461 --> 17:24.253
I'm queen of Furniture Mountain!

17:24.253 --> 17:25.375
(chuckles)

17:25.375 --> 17:27.717
Frankie, we need to find Bernie.

17:27.717 --> 17:28.968
You're right.

17:31.171 --> 17:33.383
Ha-ha, you fell
for my trick!

17:33.383 --> 17:36.676
Now I'm the queen!

17:36.676 --> 17:38.518
I don't care
who the queen is.

17:38.518 --> 17:41.521
Can someone untie me?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.814
What are you doing?
It's chaos up there.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.237
That Marge is tied up,
people are fighting,

17:47.237 --> 17:49.149
there's a furniture mountain,

17:49.149 --> 17:50.490
and I'm the queen.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.783
For now.

17:54.784 --> 17:56.746
Anyway, we need your help.

17:56.746 --> 17:58.658
Oh, now you need me?

17:58.658 --> 18:00.079
What are you talking about?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.582
You didn't need me for
your secret Bizaardvark meeting.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.705
You didn't-- you didn't need
my File of Fixes.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.917
You think by throwing me
a few compliments,

18:07.917 --> 18:09.299
you can just walk all over me.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.512
Yeah, I heard.

18:12.512 --> 18:15.765
You know, it's funny,

18:15.765 --> 18:19.429
you told me no one here
takes me seriously.

18:19.429 --> 18:23.313
The truth is,
you don't take me seriously.

18:24.524 --> 18:27.567
Bernie, that's totally...

18:27.567 --> 18:28.988
not wrong.

18:28.988 --> 18:31.231
Yeah, but in our defense...

18:31.231 --> 18:33.573
we're terrible people?

18:33.573 --> 18:35.535
We're sorry for taking
advantage of you.

18:37.327 --> 18:38.698
We wanted to finish our video

18:38.698 --> 18:40.910
and completely forgot
about your feelings.

18:40.910 --> 18:43.163
You work your butt off
for Bizaardvark.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.745
Paige:
You've always been there for us.

18:45.745 --> 18:48.878
And if it means anything,
you were doing a great job
running Vuuugle.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.341
Frankie:
People really
took you seriously.

18:51.341 --> 18:53.092
So...

18:53.092 --> 18:55.094
what can we do to get you
to be the boss again?

18:57.557 --> 18:59.429
There is one thing.

19:02.222 --> 19:06.316
All:
Hey... Bizaardvark!

19:06.316 --> 19:08.648
Chills.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.649
Let's do this!

19:13.152 --> 19:15.235
Hey-hey!

19:15.235 --> 19:17.617
Your boss is back
and ready to listen

19:17.617 --> 19:19.539
to your concerns!

19:19.539 --> 19:21.621
Number 88!

19:23.453 --> 19:25.245
Eighty-eight?

19:25.245 --> 19:27.417
Vuuuglers:
Boo!

19:27.417 --> 19:30.550
Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:30.550 --> 19:32.292
Bernie, your old ways
aren't working.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.383
You need to do
something big.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.347
Get me Pyro Steve.

19:39.759 --> 19:41.641
(whirring)

19:41.641 --> 19:42.892
It's Liam!

19:42.892 --> 19:44.514
Who's Liam?

19:45.935 --> 19:49.859
My name is
 Bernard Miriam Schotz,

19:49.859 --> 19:51.571
and I'm the boss.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.487
Do I have your attention now?

19:58.618 --> 20:01.531
You! Get off Horse Face Guy!

20:01.531 --> 20:03.413
He's a man!

20:05.124 --> 20:08.498
Amelia, lay off
 the marshmallows!

20:08.498 --> 20:12.632
-I'm making a Gliiink.
-(camera beeps)

20:12.632 --> 20:15.214
People of Furniture Mountain,

20:15.214 --> 20:18.428
tear down these cushions!

20:20.970 --> 20:22.762
It's like the song says,

20:22.762 --> 20:24.844
everything's better
with pyro.

20:24.844 --> 20:26.686
(whistles)

20:26.686 --> 20:29.519
It's good to have you
back in charge, Bernie.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.110
And I think I can
speak for all of us

20:31.110 --> 20:33.773
when I say that
everyone takes you seriously.

20:33.773 --> 20:36.406
Liam:
 You cannot be serious!

20:38.237 --> 20:41.821
What an appropriate time
 to check in.

20:41.821 --> 20:43.623
Bernie, you're fired.

20:45.325 --> 20:46.826
Vacay over.

20:46.826 --> 20:51.250
Time to return
to my life of garbage.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.332
(beep)

20:52.332 --> 20:54.714
Well, until he gets back
from Maui,

20:54.714 --> 20:57.927
I can ride this robot
and no one can stop me.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.341
(thump)

21:01.341 --> 21:03.222
(clattering)

21:03.222 --> 21:04.644
Uh...

21:05.805 --> 21:07.477
Bad news, everybody.

21:07.477 --> 21:10.189
I just could not get
my head around Gliiink.
