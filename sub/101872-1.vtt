01:29.757 --> 01:31.391

01:31.425 --> 01:32.827
Be quiet.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.230
Fuck you are you gonna kill me?

just let me outta here.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.643
Just drive.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.596

03:11.258 --> 03:13.360
Four other names,
four other names.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.395
I know things must have
been hard over there, alright.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.864
You know the war is over right?

03:18.900 --> 03:19.767
Who are you?

03:19.801 --> 03:20.635
What?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.369
Are you one of them? Are you one
of them?

03:22.402 --> 03:23.370
No, I'm not one of them.

03:23.403 --> 03:24.138
Bullshit.

03:24.172 --> 03:25.506
How do you know
so much about me?

03:25.540 --> 03:26.808
It was a guess,
it was a guess.

03:26.841 --> 03:28.676
It was just a guess man,
you look like a soldier.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.678
Everybody thinks I'm the enemy.

03:30.712 --> 03:32.479
How do I know I can trust you.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.815
I'm not with anybody, man!

03:33.848 --> 03:36.551
I'm a mediocre college
student at best, alright?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.285
I just wanna get through the day
in one piece.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.253
Woah, woah, woah.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.557
I just trying to get through the
day in one piece, alright?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.257
Just relax.
calm down, alright?

03:44.291 --> 03:46.359
I'm just gonna drive, okay?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.596
I'm just gonna drive.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.967
Then just drive.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.818
Cathy McAdams
and four other names.

05:37.672 --> 05:38.940
Get out.

05:40.141 --> 05:42.475
Come on, get out.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.645
Over there.

10:35.336 --> 10:36.837
What are you doing?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.711
Hey man did you hear me?

10:45.146 --> 10:46.247
So, why are you doing this?

10:47.481 --> 10:49.450
Fuck, man, I already got you
where you needed to go, alright.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.218
You don't need me anymore.

10:51.252 --> 10:53.821
You know who I am.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.688
Can't let you go now.

11:00.261 --> 11:01.896
In Northeast Philadelphia.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.898
Come on man, I won't tell
anyone, alright? I promise.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.334
I know you won't.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.109
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,

11:15.142 --> 11:16.877
Cathy McAdams,
and four other names.

11:16.911 --> 11:18.846
Four other names,
four other names.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.781
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,

11:20.814 --> 11:22.183
Did you hear me?
I said I won't tell anyone.

11:22.216 --> 11:23.717
You can let me go.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.387
Can't take that chance.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.127
Driver. Driver, what was his
name?

11:33.160 --> 11:33.827
Emily Pierson,
Sean Reynolds...

11:33.861 --> 11:35.162
Hey!

11:35.196 --> 11:37.164
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,

11:37.198 --> 11:39.400
Cathy McAdams,
and four other names.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.504
Steve, Maggie, Cathy McAdams.

11:42.537 --> 11:44.371
The driver.

11:44.405 --> 11:46.440
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds...

11:46.473 --> 11:48.275
Hey man what the fuck
are we doing here?

11:48.309 --> 11:50.978
Steve, Maggie, Cathy McAdams...
waiting.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.348
Waiting. That's cool.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.950
What are we waiting for?

11:55.983 --> 11:58.819
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,
Cathy McAdams

11:58.852 --> 11:59.820
and four other names.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.355
Hey man,
what are we waiting for?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.490
Four other names, four other
names, four other names.

12:06.360 --> 12:10.130
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,
George Barker, Steve, Maggie...

12:10.164 --> 12:13.467
Wait a second...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.769
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,
George Barker...

12:15.803 --> 12:17.304
I know who you are.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.940
You killed him.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.143
You killed him, didn't you?

12:25.045 --> 12:25.547
You killed the president.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.081
I didn't kill him.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.985
Alright, man.
Whatever you say.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.254
You're the boss.

12:33.287 --> 12:34.388
Just don't fucking kill me,
alright?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.390
Listen I'm not
going to kill you,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.459
but I'm not letting you
go until I'm ready to go.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.528
Period.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.103
How long are we gonna stay here?

12:50.404 --> 12:52.039
As long as it takes for
me to get some answers.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.347
Listen, I don't want
to be a part of this, alright?

13:00.381 --> 13:01.815
Keep me out of it.

13:01.849 --> 13:02.950
I already plotted this.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.486
So relax, alright and let's

13:05.520 --> 13:08.055
just let this thing

13:08.088 --> 13:09.957
play itself out.

13:23.837 --> 13:28.008
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,
Cathy McAdams

13:28.042 --> 13:30.578
Four other names,
four other names.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.944
Stop the car!

14:07.014 --> 14:07.615
Open the door!

14:08.683 --> 14:09.316
Open it!

14:13.020 --> 14:14.021
Drive.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.056
Drive!

14:16.090 --> 14:17.257
I'm going.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.300
It's not for you.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.471
No, wait!

15:06.641 --> 15:10.477
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,

15:10.512 --> 15:13.180
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,

15:13.213 --> 15:14.148
and Cathy McAdams...

15:14.181 --> 15:16.183
This is bullshit, man.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.420
Shh!

15:24.057 --> 15:25.058
You hear that?

15:28.028 --> 15:29.430
No, I don't hear that.
What are you talking about?

15:29.463 --> 15:31.398
Shh!

16:33.393 --> 16:35.262
The Manhunt for the man
who assassinated the President

16:35.295 --> 16:36.430
continues.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.332
Police departments
from 3 states,

16:38.365 --> 16:40.635
along with the Secret
Service, the FBI,

16:40.668 --> 16:43.705
and the NSA are working together
to bring the man who murdered

16:43.738 --> 16:45.807
America's President to justice.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.276
The city is on lockdown: All bus
and train stations have doubled

16:49.309 --> 16:50.778
their security.

16:50.812 --> 16:53.615
Road blocks have been setup
across all bridges and tunnels.

16:53.648 --> 16:56.049
All outgoing flights
have been terminated.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.051
I'm standing by
with David Corinth,

16:58.085 --> 16:59.521
head of the Secret Service.

16:59.554 --> 17:02.189
Mr. Corinth, the country
is looking for answers.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.156
Could you tell us,

17:03.190 --> 17:05.660
how one man could infiltrate the
White House,

17:05.693 --> 17:08.362
take out all its security
and the Secret Service,

17:08.395 --> 17:11.098
then murder our
Commander and Chief?

17:11.131 --> 17:13.066
Well, the man must've
been highly trained.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.770
He was a Marine, 8
years, highly decorated,

17:15.803 --> 17:17.739
for multiple acts of bravery.

17:17.772 --> 17:19.541
But we believe he might have
received

17:19.574 --> 17:22.175
additional training,
maybe in the Middle East.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.311
Our investigation
is still ongoing

17:24.344 --> 17:26.514
but it seems like he
was working alone.

17:26.548 --> 17:28.616
But right now
that's just speculation.

17:28.650 --> 17:33.120
One thing we do know is that he
is a highly trained assassin.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.590
We've identified the
suspect as Luke King,

17:35.623 --> 17:38.693
a former Marine from the
special forces division.

17:38.726 --> 17:42.129
King was honorably discharged
over 6 months ago.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.832
If you see Luke King
do not approach him,

17:44.866 --> 17:46.768
contact the authorities.

17:46.801 --> 17:50.137
This suspect is considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.642
I don't know man,

17:54.676 --> 17:56.276
that
looks a lot like you.

17:57.612 --> 18:00.213
Somebody set me up.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.481
I'm gonna find out who.

18:03.818 --> 18:05.252
So the press got it wrong?

18:05.285 --> 18:07.822
No the press is
telling it wrong.

18:07.855 --> 18:10.157
The person who killed the
President

18:10.190 --> 18:11.693
that looks like me,
but that's not me.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.863
You got a twin brother
you don't know about?

18:15.897 --> 18:17.331
No.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.301
Okay,
then who the hell else could it be?

18:27.942 --> 18:29.276
A Clone.

18:30.511 --> 18:31.679
What?

18:31.713 --> 18:33.280
That's a clone.

18:37.885 --> 18:39.453
That's a clone.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.592
Clone.

18:49.731 --> 18:51.431
You might want to think up a
better storyline than that for

18:51.465 --> 18:52.265
your defense.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.769
It's original.
I'll give you that.

18:54.802 --> 18:56.537
But it's a little too
over the top for the jury.

19:05.947 --> 19:07.280
You serious?

19:11.218 --> 19:12.687
There are things going on in
this world that you wouldn't

19:12.720 --> 19:16.858
possibly believe, or understand.

19:16.891 --> 19:18.458
And I believe private
corporations

19:18.492 --> 19:19.861
are more than capable

19:19.894 --> 19:21.361
to make a clone of a person.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.199
I don't know man.

19:28.703 --> 19:29.871
I think you're reaching.

19:33.608 --> 19:35.610
All those tests.

19:36.811 --> 19:37.912
The pills.

19:43.518 --> 19:44.585
What were they doing?

21:14.742 --> 21:16.577
Hey,
you are gonna get that kid killed

21:16.611 --> 21:18.713
and for no reason.

21:18.746 --> 21:21.481
If you let him go now,
I'll keep him out of it.

21:23.684 --> 21:24.552
Who is this?

21:25.953 --> 21:27.522
Tell the
kid to pull the car over.

21:27.555 --> 21:28.421
Now.

21:29.657 --> 21:31.926
You the one who
tried to kill me?

21:31.959 --> 21:33.961
You're making this
way more difficult than it has to be.

21:35.129 --> 21:36.363
Why are you chasing me?

21:38.032 --> 21:40.735
You run, I chase you.

21:40.768 --> 21:43.037
It's what I do.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.439
Run as long as you want,
there's no where you can go

21:46.473 --> 21:47.708
to get away from me.

21:48.709 --> 21:49.677
What the hell do
you want from me?

21:51.512 --> 21:54.115
End your
communications on the grid.

21:54.148 --> 21:55.348
And give us your source.

21:56.517 --> 21:57.350
You think I'm stupid?

21:57.384 --> 21:59.419
That's the only thing
keeping me alive.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.888
I know everything.

22:00.922 --> 22:02.690
I've got enough evidence to
bury you, the men you work for,

22:02.723 --> 22:04.892
and your whole freaking
organization.

22:04.926 --> 22:07.061
You don't know anything.

22:07.094 --> 22:09.329
You're just a rabid dog
that needs to be put down.

22:10.531 --> 22:12.066
If anything happens to me,

22:12.099 --> 22:14.035
the public learns everything the
next day.

22:15.803 --> 22:19.372
You may think
you're in control, but you're not.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.541
It's time to end this game.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.613
That's funny, I just get in the
game and now you want to end it.

22:25.646 --> 22:27.548
Let's not.

22:27.582 --> 22:29.016
Let's keep going and
see where things end.

22:41.662 --> 22:43.097
Aye, it's me.

22:43.130 --> 22:44.899
Listen, I know you're seeing a
lot of crazy stuff about me

22:44.932 --> 22:46.100
on the news.

22:46.133 --> 22:47.467
Don't believe it, alright.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.736
We need to meet.

22:48.769 --> 22:50.403
Alone.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.639
Remember the place that I went

22:51.672 --> 22:52.740
whenever my Mom kicked
me out

22:52.773 --> 22:54.474
because I got
suspended from school?

22:54.508 --> 22:56.043
Meet me there, ASAP.

23:01.082 --> 23:01.782
Give me your phone.

23:01.816 --> 23:02.683
What?

23:07.688 --> 23:08.623
What the fuck man!

23:08.656 --> 23:10.558
Shut up!

23:27.708 --> 23:30.177
In this exclusive
world news report

23:30.211 --> 23:32.914
you will see how one of today's
top mathematician...

23:32.947 --> 23:34.048
Hey, man.

23:35.816 --> 23:37.685
Hey, could we loosen the cuffs
a bit?

23:39.153 --> 23:40.855
Hey.

23:40.888 --> 23:42.189
Hey, man!

23:42.223 --> 23:42.957
My wrists are killing me.

23:42.990 --> 23:44.859
Can you loosen the cuffs,
please?

23:46.661 --> 23:47.828
Please, my wrists
are killing me.

23:47.862 --> 23:49.697
Can you loosen the cuffs, man?

23:51.632 --> 23:53.000
Hey man, come on.

23:54.635 --> 23:56.637
Loosen the cuffs please,
come on.

24:00.741 --> 24:02.143
Thank you.

24:13.054 --> 24:15.756
Oh that's better.

24:15.790 --> 24:17.457
God.

24:24.632 --> 24:25.833
Come here.

24:26.767 --> 24:27.969
What?

24:28.002 --> 24:28.936
Yeah.

24:28.970 --> 24:30.137
Are you?

24:30.171 --> 24:31.138
Are you serious?

24:31.172 --> 24:32.606
That's the best its gonna get.

24:33.274 --> 24:34.742
Are you serious?

24:37.144 --> 24:38.779
What the hell man?
How is this better?

24:58.899 --> 25:00.067
At least tell me what
we're waiting for?

25:01.736 --> 25:03.004
A friend.

25:04.572 --> 25:05.973
I need someone I know, to
know that I'm not a killer.

25:07.341 --> 25:09.710
When you talk to your friend,

25:09.744 --> 25:11.912
you gonna stick with this clone
story?

25:11.946 --> 25:14.148
It's not a story, alright?

25:14.181 --> 25:15.716
I, I try to focus
to try to remember.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.785
But I can't.

25:20.821 --> 25:22.656
Maybe you should get
back on your medication.

25:24.725 --> 25:25.960
It's like, they grab
a hold of your mind.

25:25.993 --> 25:27.094
And they rip it out of you.

25:27.128 --> 25:28.963
Then they put something else
back in.

25:28.996 --> 25:30.631
But you don't know what it is.

25:30.664 --> 25:33.801
But it's there.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.336
It's in there.

25:35.369 --> 25:35.903
Do you hear voices?

25:35.936 --> 25:37.638
No. It's not like that.

25:37.671 --> 25:40.041
It's like a...
It's like a...

25:40.074 --> 25:42.610
It's like a black
hole and it's deep.

25:43.677 --> 25:44.678
You can't see it.

25:44.712 --> 25:45.813
But you know it's in there.

25:47.715 --> 25:49.550
Maybe it will be easier if you
can accept your reality.

25:51.185 --> 25:53.888
No, never.

25:55.856 --> 25:56.891
This isn't my reality.

25:59.794 --> 26:00.961
Reality is what you make it.

26:05.966 --> 26:07.835
Just be quiet.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.889
Cheers.

26:28.923 --> 26:30.958
I don't know what to think, man.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.126
And that's why I brought
everybody over here

26:32.159 --> 26:33.861
so we can kinda talk about it.

26:36.030 --> 26:36.864
Yo.

26:36.897 --> 26:38.399
Whatsupp brothers.

26:45.906 --> 26:47.108
Good to see you, man.

26:49.944 --> 26:51.045
What's happening?

26:51.078 --> 26:52.413
We all know why we're here,
hoo?

26:52.446 --> 26:54.281
Hoo!

26:54.315 --> 26:56.984
And we believe what they say
on television?

26:57.017 --> 26:59.120
Smith had some sort
of psychotic break

26:59.153 --> 27:01.322
then went on a rampage
and killed 10 people

27:01.355 --> 27:02.289
at a farmer's market.

27:02.323 --> 27:04.158
Na, man.

27:04.191 --> 27:05.192
I ain't buying that.

27:05.226 --> 27:07.728
Na, that's bullshit.

27:08.597 --> 27:11.198
Ever since we got back,
everyone has been falling apart.

27:11.232 --> 27:12.333
You officers think about those
doctors?

27:12.366 --> 27:14.034
Naa.

27:14.068 --> 27:15.035
Doctors?

27:15.069 --> 27:16.070
You aren't calling that.

27:16.103 --> 27:17.171
They're more like scientists.

27:17.204 --> 27:19.039
Those clips...

27:19.073 --> 27:21.041
that they showed us.

27:21.075 --> 27:22.843
Those questions.

27:22.877 --> 27:24.078
Yeah, I think they used us
as guinea pigs.

27:43.063 --> 27:44.131
No.

30:55.690 --> 30:57.124
No, wait, wait!

33:25.773 --> 33:28.776
We're speaking to
Marine Sergeant William Copeland,

33:28.810 --> 33:31.679
who was station with
Luke King in Afghanistan.

33:31.713 --> 33:33.347
"You were is Squad
Leader weren't you?"

33:33.380 --> 33:34.181
"Yeah, sir.

33:34.214 --> 33:35.482
He was a good soldier.

33:35.517 --> 33:37.050
He saved my life.

33:37.084 --> 33:39.253
And I wasn't the only one.

33:39.286 --> 33:40.588
I'd kept in contact with some
of the guys

33:40.622 --> 33:42.557
when we got back state side..

33:42.590 --> 33:45.192
And they told me he was having
problems adjusting.

33:45.225 --> 33:47.194
I don't know man...

33:47.227 --> 33:48.830
I wish I would've
reached out to him more.

33:48.863 --> 33:50.632
You know what I mean?"

33:50.665 --> 33:53.300
"Do you believe
he killed the President?"

33:53.333 --> 33:57.404
"King can
get pretty angry sometimes.

33:57.437 --> 33:58.673
I mean, he was disappointed
with the government

33:58.706 --> 34:00.374
to say the least.

34:00.407 --> 34:01.743
He didn't feel like they were
being transparent

34:01.776 --> 34:04.278
or honest enough, you know?

34:04.311 --> 34:05.613
He really thought, they were
poisoning him.

34:05.647 --> 34:07.815
Stopped eating meat.
Stopped eating fish.

34:07.849 --> 34:10.250
He wouldn't eat anything
that was processed.

34:10.284 --> 34:13.555
But then he stopped
watching TV and, and...

34:13.588 --> 34:16.223
started not wanting to listen
to the radio.

34:16.256 --> 34:18.392
He thought that they were in his
head in some kind of way.

34:18.425 --> 34:20.160
He wanted to get them
out of his thoughts.

34:20.193 --> 34:22.797
And stop them from controlling
his thoughts, I don't know.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.533
He would get depressed about it.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.603
Sometimes, the guys said that he
would sit

34:28.636 --> 34:30.337
in his room for days at a time

34:30.370 --> 34:33.775
just let the candles burn.

34:33.808 --> 34:35.342
I don't know.

34:36.076 --> 34:39.112
He was crazy sometimes,
I can't lie.

34:39.146 --> 34:41.816
But could he have killed
the President?

34:41.849 --> 34:43.116
Luke?

34:43.150 --> 34:45.419
Luke was a good man.

34:45.452 --> 34:46.754
He was my friend.

34:46.788 --> 34:48.322
A brave soldier.

34:48.355 --> 34:50.858
And if he put his mind to it,
he could do anything.

34:50.892 --> 34:55.195
And if he thought like he had
a good reason for doing it?

34:55.228 --> 34:57.264
He could do it in his
sub-conscious, no question.

34:57.297 --> 34:59.567
So yes, I think he did it.

35:01.168 --> 35:03.370
I think he did kill the
President."

35:03.403 --> 35:04.404
He has family in Virginia?

35:04.438 --> 35:06.239
He hasn't spoken to them since
he was discharged

35:06.273 --> 35:07.407
from the military.

35:07.441 --> 35:09.242
His parents are both retired.

35:09.276 --> 35:11.178
His father, a former bus driver,

35:11.211 --> 35:13.180
his mother, a high school
teacher.

35:13.213 --> 35:15.182
He was a troubled child
and spent his teen years

35:15.215 --> 35:16.918
in and out of juvenile detention
center.

35:16.951 --> 35:20.588
Until he joined the marines
at age 20 to avoid jail time.

35:20.622 --> 35:23.256
He was a model soldier during
his tour with the marines.

35:23.290 --> 35:25.760
But Doctors say after he was
discharged and returned home,

35:25.793 --> 35:28.663
he began to show signs of PTSD,
and had bouts of anger

35:28.696 --> 35:30.464
and paranoia.

35:30.497 --> 35:31.933
Doctors had prescribed
medication,

35:31.966 --> 35:33.701
but he might not be taking it.

35:33.735 --> 35:37.204
If he's not, he could become
extremely violent and hostile.

35:37.237 --> 35:39.507
If you see Luke King,
don't approach him,

35:39.540 --> 35:40.908
stay away and alert
the authorities.

35:50.585 --> 35:51.485
Is all that stuff true?

35:56.256 --> 35:57.224
Most of it.

36:02.864 --> 36:05.633
Must suck having
your whole life on display

36:05.667 --> 36:09.269
to the whole world like that.

36:09.302 --> 36:11.873
Doesn't matter if everyone
thinks you're dead anyway?

36:11.906 --> 36:14.374
You could just disappear,
and start over.

36:14.408 --> 36:15.743
Because I want to be me
that's why.

36:20.247 --> 36:22.282
They took everything from me.

36:22.315 --> 36:25.586
I can't even go back to
see my family or my friends.

36:26.921 --> 36:27.955
I might as well be dead.

36:33.761 --> 36:37.765
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,

36:37.799 --> 36:39.667
and Cathy McAdams,
four other names.

36:41.836 --> 36:45.305
The other day in the car.

36:45.338 --> 36:47.542
Did you have proof that it
wasn't you?

36:47.575 --> 36:50.678
That you can bring them
all down.

36:50.712 --> 36:52.412
What's the proof?

36:55.950 --> 36:56.951
That's not even important
right now.

36:56.984 --> 36:59.554
What's important right now

36:59.587 --> 37:01.321
What's important right now
is that we play this thing on

37:01.354 --> 37:03.356
and that means we wait.

37:05.860 --> 37:08.896
But you could use that
information to clear your name.

37:08.930 --> 37:11.498
Why are you just waiting here?

37:11.532 --> 37:14.802
Why don't you be proactive?

37:14.836 --> 37:16.537
Once it's in the
public, you'll be safe.

37:20.007 --> 37:22.677
What's the proof?

37:22.710 --> 37:23.878
What do you have on them?

37:26.581 --> 37:28.415
Kid for your own good.

37:28.448 --> 37:29.650
It's best if you
don't know right now.

37:48.870 --> 37:49.670
Ya'll remember Ghazni?

37:49.704 --> 37:50.905
Ghanzi?

37:50.938 --> 37:53.040
Sending us out on recon
without proper equipment

37:53.074 --> 37:54.675
and then we get hit by a dirty
bomb.

37:54.709 --> 37:56.010
That's bullshit.

37:56.043 --> 37:57.712
Dumars died a slow
death on that one.

37:59.847 --> 38:02.415
How many of you are still taking
that medication every morning?

38:03.785 --> 38:05.485
Isn't it to useful for
those chemical attacks?

38:06.888 --> 38:07.989
That's what they say.

38:08.956 --> 38:10.024
What if it's not?

38:12.425 --> 38:13.961
Sometimes I have been having
these dreams.

38:13.995 --> 38:15.830
Argh, man.

38:17.397 --> 38:18.766
It's like we're killin' people.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.400
We all do that.

38:20.433 --> 38:21.803
I know,
but it wasn't in the East.

38:21.836 --> 38:22.770
It was here.

38:24.005 --> 38:24.672
What?

38:24.705 --> 38:25.540
Here.

38:25.573 --> 38:26.406
Out in West.

38:26.439 --> 38:28.009
I know.

39:08.716 --> 39:10.151
Hey, who say the game last
night?

39:49.991 --> 39:51.692
Get up.

40:05.873 --> 40:07.541
Shit's getting old man.

40:11.012 --> 40:12.445
You hear me, this shit's getting
old.

40:12.479 --> 40:13.781
Get up.

40:32.233 --> 40:35.169
A Missing Persons Alert
has been issued for Jerry Wilson,

40:35.202 --> 40:38.471
a 24 year old college
student from the LA area.

40:38.506 --> 40:41.175
He drives a white Forrester
and was last seen downtown,

40:41.208 --> 40:43.110
where traffic cameras spotted
him on the corner of 9th and

40:43.144 --> 40:44.879
Broadway.

40:44.912 --> 40:47.848
His parents are
offering a $50,000 reward

40:47.882 --> 40:49.717
for anyone able to
supply information

40:49.750 --> 40:51.519
that leads to his discovery.

40:51.552 --> 40:53.554
If you have any information
about Jerry Wilson

40:53.587 --> 40:55.156
or his whereabouts call the
number

40:55.189 --> 40:56.489
listed on the screen.

40:56.524 --> 40:58.626
Did you see that?

40:58.659 --> 41:00.661
You see, They're looking for me.

41:02.797 --> 41:05.232
I'd be very worried
if I were you.

41:05.266 --> 41:06.634
What?

41:06.667 --> 41:08.035
Why?

41:08.069 --> 41:10.604
They put you on the TV.

41:10.638 --> 41:13.140
This is a Nation wide broadcast
announcing a search for you.

41:17.078 --> 41:18.212
Yeah, that's great.

41:20.314 --> 41:23.818
They never mentioned me.

41:23.851 --> 41:25.186
What do you think is gonna
happen to you

41:25.219 --> 41:28.022
when the guys that are looking
for me find you?

41:33.995 --> 41:37.031
Then let me go and
get back on your meds.

41:37.064 --> 41:38.766
Or get back on your
meds and let me go.

41:38.799 --> 41:40.267
You still don't get it do you?

41:40.301 --> 41:42.136
These people were able
to make a clone of me,

41:42.169 --> 41:45.606
some super clone and then
kill the President with it.

41:45.639 --> 41:47.108
You don't think they're above
manipulating the media

41:47.141 --> 41:50.311
to help them find us
and then kill us.

41:50.344 --> 41:53.948
Open your eyes kid, even if I
let you go, you'll end up dead.

41:56.984 --> 41:59.987
Just...

42:00.021 --> 42:01.922
Just sit tight.

42:34.622 --> 42:35.856
Hello.

42:45.199 --> 42:47.034
You are a dead man.

42:47.068 --> 42:48.669
Mr. Garnerson you have to
understand

42:48.702 --> 42:49.904
You are a dead man.

42:49.937 --> 42:51.172
Mr. Gandersund.

42:51.205 --> 42:52.606
You talked, didn't you?

42:52.640 --> 42:54.208
I did not talk sir.
I did not talk.

42:54.241 --> 42:56.077
I'm still enrolled
in the program.

42:56.110 --> 42:57.344
Tell me the truth soldier.

42:57.378 --> 42:59.713
On my word sir,
on my word.

42:59.747 --> 43:01.582
I'm still the prof...

43:06.987 --> 43:09.123
Hello.

43:15.062 --> 43:16.864
Baby, listen.

43:16.897 --> 43:18.833
You gotta get the kids.
Take them to mom's.

43:18.866 --> 43:19.834
Why what's the matter?

43:19.867 --> 43:20.835
They know?

43:20.868 --> 43:21.902
how?

43:21.936 --> 43:23.037
I don't know, I don't know.

43:23.070 --> 43:25.806
They just know, they know.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.374
Take the kids, I'll
meet you when I can.

43:27.408 --> 43:29.110
Oh my God. Oh my God.

46:02.363 --> 46:03.764
Hello?

46:07.968 --> 46:10.437
No, no.
Please, please, no, no, no!

46:37.965 --> 46:39.601
After months of speculation
Archdiocese of Philadelphia

46:39.634 --> 46:43.337
and its 16 member blue ribbon
committee has called for the

46:43.370 --> 46:47.941
closing of 10 Catholic schools,
including Roman high school.

46:47.975 --> 46:50.878
The closings are the result of
falling enrollments and the

46:50.911 --> 46:54.882
opening of many charter
schools in the area.

46:54.915 --> 46:57.351
In politics today,
the race for the GOP...

47:16.337 --> 47:18.472
What the hell took you so long?

47:18.506 --> 47:22.476
I was being
followed and I lost it.

47:22.510 --> 47:23.410
What's going on, huh?

47:23.444 --> 47:25.245
Everything's upside
down, alright.

47:25.279 --> 47:28.048
I'm still trying to
put things together.

47:28.082 --> 47:29.249
You need to talk to your boy.

47:29.283 --> 47:32.386
He's got issues.

47:32.419 --> 47:33.521
Who's this?

47:33.555 --> 47:36.658
The guy who wants to go home.

47:36.691 --> 47:38.058
I needed a ride, alright?

47:38.092 --> 47:39.293
He was at the right place, right
time.

47:39.326 --> 47:42.463
Wrong place, wrong time.

47:42.496 --> 47:44.031
I just want to get the hell
out of here.

47:44.064 --> 47:46.333
Tell your friend to let me go.

47:46.367 --> 47:48.335
Are you serious?

47:54.441 --> 47:55.643
You got a hostage?

47:55.677 --> 47:59.079
I didn't plan for it like that,
it just turned out that way.

47:59.113 --> 48:00.548
What the hell is going on, Luke?

48:00.582 --> 48:02.416
Is it true, did you kill him?

48:02.449 --> 48:04.017
No, I didn't kill him.

48:04.051 --> 48:05.252
Have I killed people, Yes,

48:05.285 --> 48:08.989
but I didn't do this, all right,
you got to believe me, man.

48:09.022 --> 48:10.324
Put that away.

48:21.101 --> 48:22.604
And if you're a surfer,
you'll like this story,

48:22.637 --> 48:25.472
big waves expected to pound the
Southern California coastline in

48:25.507 --> 48:28.108
San Diego today and tomorrow.

48:28.142 --> 48:30.678
Waves could be breaking more
than 10 feet...

48:30.712 --> 48:32.079
Can you turn this down?

48:32.112 --> 48:33.648
That is just adding to your
stress.

48:35.482 --> 48:37.184
This is KNX Newsradio.

48:37.217 --> 48:40.187
Luke, I believe you bro.

48:40.220 --> 48:41.455
I do.

48:44.091 --> 48:45.993
Wait, wait, wait.
You believe him?

48:49.764 --> 48:51.465
I believe whatever you you think
you're thinking is real.

48:54.702 --> 48:56.170
What if it's not?

48:57.572 --> 48:58.972
Have you been taking the pills?

49:02.677 --> 49:04.111
What if I told you
there were cops outside?

49:13.487 --> 49:14.321
Are you serious?

49:18.459 --> 49:19.594
No.

49:22.262 --> 49:24.231
But what if I was?

49:24.264 --> 49:25.499
Would you give up?

49:25.533 --> 49:27.201
Nope.

49:27.234 --> 49:28.736
Too many people have died for
this.

49:28.770 --> 49:30.304
Their families need
to know the truth.

49:31.506 --> 49:32.607
What truth?

49:32.640 --> 49:35.309
That their family members
weren't killed by accident.

49:35.342 --> 49:38.011
They were killed on purpose by
the US government

49:38.045 --> 49:39.480
to allow the
enemy to move forward with the

49:39.514 --> 49:42.082
biggest conspiracy
in US history.

49:42.115 --> 49:43.417
I'm not the one to
kill the President.

49:45.285 --> 49:46.320
Who is this enemy you
keep talking about?

49:46.353 --> 49:49.122
Shhhh!

49:50.424 --> 49:51.258
Did you hear that?

49:52.794 --> 49:53.661
Hear what?

51:02.429 --> 51:03.765
You should get out of here,
the cops...

51:13.875 --> 51:16.544
Part of this is my fault, I
should've spotted the signs

51:16.578 --> 51:17.779
and known something was wrong.

51:19.146 --> 51:21.248
I was on my way to see Freddie,
okay?

51:21.281 --> 51:23.718
We've been putting
things together.

51:23.751 --> 51:27.287
The Doctor, the tests, all
those pills and injections.

51:27.321 --> 51:28.455
They were experimenting on us.

51:30.490 --> 51:33.528
I was on my way to Washington,
the bus stopped at a Rest Area.

51:33.561 --> 51:35.295
I had an episode
in the restroom.

51:35.329 --> 51:36.396
I lost time.

51:36.430 --> 51:38.198
After it was over,
the bus was gone.

51:38.231 --> 51:39.433
So I went off the grid.

51:39.466 --> 51:41.669
Three days later I learn
about the assassination.

51:43.337 --> 51:45.272
I watched them tell the
world that it was me.

51:45.305 --> 51:46.406
But its a damn lie.

51:49.309 --> 51:51.613
I have no doubts that
you believe this.

51:51.646 --> 51:54.147
But you have to see things
from my point of view,

51:54.181 --> 51:55.248
what are the facts?

51:56.450 --> 51:58.285
You're the one running.

51:58.318 --> 52:00.688
You're the one
everybody's looking for.

52:00.722 --> 52:03.390
If you're not the one who killed
the President then who did?

52:04.491 --> 52:05.793
It was a clone!

52:05.827 --> 52:07.528
They made a clone of me!

52:07.562 --> 52:08.663
Why won't you believe me?

52:10.297 --> 52:11.599
You know what?

52:11.633 --> 52:13.400
Regardless of what
you think,

52:13.433 --> 52:15.670
I think the doctors took samples
of our DNA and they're making

52:15.703 --> 52:17.572
clones with them.

52:17.605 --> 52:18.606
Cause that ain't me.

52:22.376 --> 52:23.678
You know how this
makes you look right?

52:23.711 --> 52:25.278
Don't... don't say it.

52:25.312 --> 52:26.179
Don't say that word.

52:26.213 --> 52:27.882
Once you say that
word I know you're lost.

52:27.915 --> 52:30.785
You'll dismiss everything that I
have to say.

52:30.818 --> 52:33.921
I need you to open your mind man
and accept the possibility that

52:33.955 --> 52:35.556
something like this
could actually happen.

52:37.959 --> 52:38.860
Alright.

52:39.627 --> 52:41.929
You think these private
companies are satisfied

52:41.963 --> 52:44.464
just cloning mice?

52:44.498 --> 52:46.534
You think they're satisfied with
just cloning mice and sheep?

52:46.567 --> 52:48.435
Using animals to
grow simple body parts?

52:48.468 --> 52:50.470
You think they would just
stop there, right?

52:50.505 --> 52:51.806
No.

52:51.839 --> 52:54.542
They're goal is to
create the whole human person.

52:54.575 --> 52:57.578
Create a man that's
programmed like a computer.

52:57.612 --> 52:59.379
A man easy to control.

52:59.413 --> 53:01.448
One with no moral
code or humanity.

53:01.481 --> 53:03.584
A man that would follow
orders without question.

53:04.886 --> 53:06.386
You need to calm down man.

53:06.420 --> 53:08.589
You're working
yourself up too much.

53:08.623 --> 53:09.924
And it doesn't
take much to clone you.

53:09.957 --> 53:11.793
All they need is a swab
of your DNA.

53:11.826 --> 53:12.927
They can get it from anywhere.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.730
They can get it from your
toothbrush, your hairbrush.

53:15.763 --> 53:17.765
A simple visit to the doctor and
they'd have everything they need

53:17.799 --> 53:18.833
to make a replica of you.

53:18.866 --> 53:21.468
One that wouldn't fight, one
that wouldn't argue,

53:21.501 --> 53:22.436
one that wouldn't disagree

53:22.469 --> 53:24.371
one that would
do what they wanted him to do

53:24.404 --> 53:25.540
whenever they wanted
him to do.

53:25.573 --> 53:26.908
No questions asked
and no remorse.

53:34.882 --> 53:37.451
Investigators have
wrapped up their primary investigation of

53:37.484 --> 53:41.656
the fiery bus crash that
happened on I-5 a few days ago.

53:41.689 --> 53:44.992
Tow trucks are on the scene and
we're told they'll begin pulling

53:45.026 --> 53:47.427
apart this wreckage, looking for
any evidence that would explain

53:47.461 --> 53:49.697
to them why, according
to their reports,

53:49.731 --> 53:51.566
the bus careened
off an embankment,

53:51.599 --> 53:54.902
smashed into a group of
trees and burst into flames.

53:54.936 --> 53:58.338
We now know, 10 people
died in that crash,

53:58.371 --> 54:00.775
including the bus
driver and two children.

54:00.808 --> 54:02.744
The names of those who
perished in the crash are:

54:03.845 --> 54:08.448
Emily Pierson, Sean Reynolds,
George Barker, Steve, Maggie,

54:08.482 --> 54:12.987
and Cathy McAdams, Tony Montero,
Becky Larson, Kevin Chan,

54:13.020 --> 54:14.922
and Jose Guzman.

54:14.956 --> 54:17.992
Those are the names.

54:18.025 --> 54:19.392
Those are the names
you keep repeating.

54:21.696 --> 54:22.697
Who are those people?

54:23.363 --> 54:25.465
These were the
people on the bus.

54:25.499 --> 54:26.868
The bus that I took
to Washington.

54:26.901 --> 54:28.069
The one that stopped at the
rest area,

54:28.102 --> 54:30.004
the one that I missed.

54:30.037 --> 54:33.775
These are people killed to
cover up this conspiracy.

54:33.808 --> 54:35.510
I am not gonna let
them go down quietly.

54:36.511 --> 54:37.310
C'mon man.

54:37.344 --> 54:38.513
That's a coincidence.

54:38.546 --> 54:39.747
There's to be an
explanation for all of this.

54:39.781 --> 54:41.549
Enough.

54:41.582 --> 54:43.084
You don't believe
me, that's fine.

54:43.117 --> 54:44.886
But no more talking.

54:44.919 --> 54:48.589
In other news,
a new Ebola vaccine was created

54:48.623 --> 54:49.924
and is ready for mass
production.

54:49.957 --> 54:52.827
KNX newstime 11:15.

55:06.741 --> 55:07.708
He's not telling you everything.

55:08.643 --> 55:09.476
What do you mean?

55:09.510 --> 55:11.444
He says he has proof.

55:11.478 --> 55:15.516
Some information that
can prove he's innocent.

55:15.550 --> 55:18.986
Luke, what proof?

55:19.020 --> 55:21.454
You don't have anything, do you?

55:23.124 --> 55:25.726
Luke, if you have some kind
of proof to clear your name,

55:25.760 --> 55:27.061
I suggest you use it.

55:27.094 --> 55:27.895
And use it now.

55:28.896 --> 55:30.698
Ignorance keeps you safe.

55:30.731 --> 55:32.934
And it's best if you
don't know.

55:36.003 --> 55:37.470
I thought we had some kind of
trust between us.

55:38.873 --> 55:40.775
We do.

55:40.808 --> 55:42.342
But they're killing
everyone connected to this!

55:43.010 --> 55:44.344
Which is why I wanna get
the hell outta here.

55:45.412 --> 55:47.081
Just let the man go Luke.

55:47.114 --> 55:48.983
You have nothing to gain
by keeping him here.

55:49.016 --> 55:50.685
Nobody going nowhere
until I say so.

55:51.619 --> 55:53.420
So I'm a hostage now?

55:53.453 --> 55:55.022
You can call it what you want.

55:55.056 --> 55:56.924
Just get comfortable, cause no
body's going nowhere

55:56.958 --> 55:58.425
until I get some answers.

55:58.458 --> 55:59.160
Are you serious?

55:59.193 --> 56:00.795
Yeah, I'm serious.

56:29.690 --> 56:31.926
The manhunt for the
man suspected of assassinating

56:31.959 --> 56:35.428
the President, has come
to a violent ending.

56:35.462 --> 56:39.466
Earlier today, anonymous tips
led police to this location,

56:39.499 --> 56:41.802
an abandoned building
in the Skid Row area,

56:41.836 --> 56:44.138
where Luke King was
hiding from authorities.

56:44.171 --> 56:47.074
Multiple Enforcement Agencies
converged on the building,

56:47.108 --> 56:49.710
he was found on the third floor.

56:49.744 --> 56:54.148
There was a brief gun battle and
Luke King was shot and killed.

56:54.181 --> 56:56.751
Compared to what happened a few
days ago at the White House,

56:56.784 --> 56:59.452
he was taken relatively easy.

56:59.486 --> 57:04.125
The police only shot 3 times and
Luke King was hit 3 times.

57:04.158 --> 57:06.928
"I, for one, am glad its over."

57:06.961 --> 57:09.931
Police are removing the body
from the building at the moment.

57:09.964 --> 57:12.533
It's been a difficult few days
for America

57:12.566 --> 57:15.536
and now we can all grieve,
knowing that Luke King,

57:15.569 --> 57:18.639
the man who assassinated our
President,

57:18.673 --> 57:21.175
our Commander and Chief has been
brought to Justice.

57:21.208 --> 57:23.978
The First Lady will be
addressing the nation

57:24.011 --> 57:26.080
this evening at 8:00 PM.

57:26.113 --> 57:28.749
I can't believe
it, you're right.

57:28.783 --> 57:29.750
I'm sorry I doubted you.

57:31.552 --> 57:33.788
It's over.

57:33.821 --> 57:34.989
I'll never have a
normal life now.

57:36.691 --> 57:37.858
What are you talking about?

57:37.892 --> 57:40.061
If you really have proof, once
you show them your proof,

57:40.094 --> 57:41.228
no one's gonna believe that.

57:41.262 --> 57:43.197
Are you kidding me?

57:43.230 --> 57:44.799
People believe everything
they see on TV!

57:45.900 --> 57:47.635
I believe you Luke.

57:47.668 --> 57:49.737
I think you're innocent.

57:49.770 --> 57:52.273
But what you're doing
man, evading authorities,

57:52.306 --> 57:56.677
armed carjacking, kidnapping.

57:56.711 --> 57:57.578
Man, you're making it all worse.

57:59.313 --> 58:02.984
Believe me when I tell
you bro, I got your back.

58:03.017 --> 58:03.784
I'm here help you.

58:04.484 --> 58:06.620
This is just a case
of mistaken identity.

58:06.654 --> 58:08.789
We can clear this all up.

58:08.823 --> 58:09.657
Have I ever let you down?

58:12.793 --> 58:14.061
Just give me the gun.

58:14.095 --> 58:15.663
Let's end this.

58:33.247 --> 58:35.082
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

58:35.116 --> 58:38.886
What's up with the gun?

58:38.919 --> 58:40.054
What the fuck?

58:41.789 --> 58:42.923
Oh shit.

58:42.957 --> 58:44.992
Oh shit.

58:45.026 --> 58:45.459
You see it?

58:45.493 --> 58:46.193
You see it right?

58:46.227 --> 58:46.861
I see it!

58:46.894 --> 58:48.062
Get that thing away from me!

58:48.629 --> 58:49.630
Put down the gun Luke.

58:52.366 --> 58:53.034
You killed my friend.

58:55.936 --> 58:57.605
I'm your friend.

58:57.638 --> 58:58.739
I could be.

58:58.773 --> 59:01.709
Things could be just like they
were,

59:01.742 --> 59:03.044
just come outside, with me.

59:55.196 --> 59:57.098
Today is a
sad day in our News Station.

59:57.131 --> 59:59.300
Today we mourn the
death of a colleague,

59:59.333 --> 1:00:01.368
one of our fellow reporters.

1:00:01.402 --> 1:00:03.904
Investigative Reporter Rebecca
March was found murdered

1:00:03.938 --> 1:00:06.073
in her home last night.

1:00:06.107 --> 1:00:08.976
Shot to death by an
unknown assailant.

1:00:09.009 --> 1:00:12.413
Neighbors heard loud noises
around 2:00PM that afternoon.

1:00:12.446 --> 1:00:15.716
Witnesses saw a man
walking from the scene.

1:00:15.749 --> 1:00:18.419
There are conflicting
accounts of his description.

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:22.189
Police are asking for help
in solving this murder.

1:00:22.223 --> 1:00:24.992
During her last broadcast, she
announced that she was set to

1:00:25.025 --> 1:00:28.062
launch a new investigation,
something, she said,

1:00:28.095 --> 1:00:30.898
that would "shake the foundation
of the US government.

1:00:30.931 --> 1:00:33.334
She claimed to have a
confidential informant,

1:00:33.367 --> 1:00:36.203
someone with unique knowledge
about the assassination.

1:00:36.237 --> 1:00:38.305
And she would be putting
together a new segment

1:00:38.339 --> 1:00:40.307
that will expose corruption
in the highest offices

1:00:40.341 --> 1:00:41.576
of our government.

1:00:41.610 --> 1:00:45.012
"Could this somehow be connected
to the Luke King investigation?"

1:00:45.045 --> 1:00:47.815
Authorities will have a lot of
questions to answer as they

1:00:47.848 --> 1:00:50.851
probe into what happened
to Rebecca March.

1:00:50.885 --> 1:00:54.121
We'll have more updates
as they come in.

1:00:54.155 --> 1:00:56.857
Rebecca
March, our colleague,

1:00:56.891 --> 1:01:00.361
our friend, will be missed.

1:01:00.394 --> 1:01:01.996
Back to you Jim."

1:01:10.237 --> 1:01:11.238
Did you know her?

1:02:13.267 --> 1:02:16.937
We were supposed
to meet in a park.

1:02:16.971 --> 1:02:18.372
After I realized I was wanted.

1:02:18.405 --> 1:02:22.943
I contacted her,
told her who I was.

1:02:24.945 --> 1:02:26.780
She wanted to meet face to face.

1:02:29.216 --> 1:02:31.352
But she never made the meet, and
I picked up a tail I've been

1:02:31.385 --> 1:02:32.920
trying to shake ever since.

1:02:35.389 --> 1:02:37.224
I got her killed.

1:02:57.177 --> 1:02:58.379
Wait.

1:02:58.412 --> 1:03:00.347
Wait.

1:03:00.381 --> 1:03:02.182
I've got to get samples.

1:03:02.216 --> 1:03:04.051
The research has to continue.

1:03:04.084 --> 1:03:05.119
Get it from the corpse.

1:03:05.152 --> 1:03:07.221
Wait, wait!

1:03:07.254 --> 1:03:08.956
Let me go in there and talk to
him at least

1:03:08.989 --> 1:03:11.292
before you level the place.

1:03:11.325 --> 1:03:13.227
He's got important data,
I need it.

1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:15.863
And I need the specimens to be
alive.

1:03:15.896 --> 1:03:19.166
Hey Doc, how long have
I been doing this?

1:03:19.199 --> 1:03:21.035
I keep telling you guys that
when they start to notice our

1:03:21.068 --> 1:03:23.370
presence its time
to put them down.

1:03:23.404 --> 1:03:25.540
But you don't listen to me.

1:03:25.573 --> 1:03:28.075
And I'm the one who gets
stuck cleaning it up.

1:03:28.108 --> 1:03:30.311
And I'm tired of it.

1:03:30.344 --> 1:03:31.412
They go down.

1:03:32.913 --> 1:03:34.848
Look, you're the
Handler, I'm the Doctor.

1:03:34.882 --> 1:03:37.051
Now you let me go in there
do my job first,

1:03:37.084 --> 1:03:38.385
then you can do whatever the
hell you wanted to.

1:03:38.419 --> 1:03:39.554
I don't care.

1:03:47.629 --> 1:03:49.997
Knock yourself out.

1:03:50.030 --> 1:03:51.065
Go.

1:04:00.274 --> 1:04:02.376
Luke King.

1:04:05.079 --> 1:04:06.180
Luke King.

1:04:07.381 --> 1:04:08.315
Who's out there?

1:04:09.450 --> 1:04:11.519
Come out Mr. King.

1:04:11.553 --> 1:04:13.320
It's time we have a talk.

1:04:13.354 --> 1:04:15.155
I... I... I'm a doctor Mr. King.

1:04:15.189 --> 1:04:17.391
I'd like to come inside please.

1:04:17.424 --> 1:04:18.560
Hell no.

1:04:20.294 --> 1:04:23.030
You have questions Mr. King.

1:04:23.063 --> 1:04:26.400
About your tour in the
Middle East,

1:04:26.433 --> 1:04:31.972
the headaches, the black outs,
your other half.

1:04:35.376 --> 1:04:37.612
Please, Mr. King
open the door

1:04:37.645 --> 1:04:39.313
all things will become clear.

1:04:42.950 --> 1:04:44.485
Come in.

1:04:51.593 --> 1:04:53.927
Shut the door.

1:05:05.607 --> 1:05:07.174
Open your coat.

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:15.149
What about my uh, my subject?

1:05:23.525 --> 1:05:26.460
It worked, I was right.

1:05:26.493 --> 1:05:29.396
The muscle mass, the strength.

1:05:29.430 --> 1:05:30.464
What about your
speed and agility?

1:05:33.434 --> 1:05:37.572
You haven't been
taking your medication.

1:05:37.605 --> 1:05:39.940
Of course not, why would you
be taking your medicine now?

1:05:43.177 --> 1:05:46.413
Have you been
experiencing headaches?

1:05:46.447 --> 1:05:49.149
Blackouts?

1:05:49.183 --> 1:05:50.284
The blackouts-

1:05:50.317 --> 1:05:51.318
The blackouts-

1:05:55.088 --> 1:05:56.624
It's completely
defective, it's worthless.

1:06:21.549 --> 1:06:24.485
Please, I know its difficult
to understand, but please,

1:06:24.519 --> 1:06:26.253
you've got to trust me.

1:06:26.286 --> 1:06:26.955
Take this.

1:06:26.987 --> 1:06:28.656
Why so you can kill me with it?

1:06:28.690 --> 1:06:30.257
No, no, no, no!

1:06:31.759 --> 1:06:34.127
I'm not your enemy Mr.
King, I'm not your enemy.

1:06:34.161 --> 1:06:35.663
But believe me when I tell
you, we don't have much time.

1:06:38.833 --> 1:06:39.601
What the hell is this?

1:06:40.334 --> 1:06:41.636
It's tetracycline.

1:06:41.669 --> 1:06:43.136
It's to help you,
it's for your mind.

1:06:44.371 --> 1:06:45.573
I'm not taking anymore
of your drugs doc,

1:06:45.607 --> 1:06:46.708
this whole experiment is over.

1:06:47.842 --> 1:06:50.678
It activates more receptors in
your brain so you can get past

1:06:50.712 --> 1:06:52.045
the programming.

1:06:52.079 --> 1:06:53.180
What programming?

1:06:53.213 --> 1:06:55.783
The programming-The headaches.

1:06:55.817 --> 1:06:58.418
The headaches the blackouts,
that's the mental block that

1:06:58.452 --> 1:07:00.187
they put in.

1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:03.223
Its to stunt you, to control
you, to stop your potential.

1:07:03.257 --> 1:07:04.258
That's what they're doing.

1:07:05.392 --> 1:07:07.494
You've got to get past the veil
so you can see through it,

1:07:07.529 --> 1:07:09.797
so you can get through
the other side.

1:07:09.831 --> 1:07:12.065
So you can be who
you really are.

1:07:14.569 --> 1:07:16.604
Please Mr. King.

1:07:16.638 --> 1:07:20.107
You've got to open your mind.

1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:22.777
You've got to see the system
that creates the system.

1:07:24.846 --> 1:07:26.079
Do you understand me?

1:07:26.113 --> 1:07:27.615
Once you do that...

1:07:27.649 --> 1:07:30.117
Once you do that,
you'll see everything,

1:07:30.150 --> 1:07:33.555
you'll understand all of it.

1:07:33.588 --> 1:07:36.423
That was just a clone.

1:07:36.456 --> 1:07:38.593
You're the original.

1:07:38.626 --> 1:07:40.628
That's why they
want to kill you,

1:07:40.662 --> 1:07:42.262
that's why they want you dead.

1:07:45.733 --> 1:07:46.534
Why are you helping me?

1:07:48.368 --> 1:07:52.105
It started out, the science.

1:07:52.139 --> 1:07:53.875
They gave me the opportunity
to do something I'd never done

1:07:53.908 --> 1:07:56.109
before, that nobody
had every done before.

1:07:56.143 --> 1:07:58.211
That was what was so
incredible about it.

1:07:58.245 --> 1:07:59.146
None of it had ever been done.

1:08:00.882 --> 1:08:04.117
But then, they took
it over and they,

1:08:04.151 --> 1:08:09.456
they-All they wanted were
perfect obedient soldiers.

1:08:09.489 --> 1:08:10.390
That's all they
wanted to create.

1:08:11.726 --> 1:08:15.563
Those tests, what
did they do to me?

1:08:18.633 --> 1:08:20.902
You were our very first subject,
you were the toughest subject

1:08:20.935 --> 1:08:22.737
we ever had.

1:08:22.770 --> 1:08:25.138
You were very resistant
to all of the mind control.

1:08:25.172 --> 1:08:27.174
But eventually they found
a way and they broke through.

1:08:30.912 --> 1:08:35.817
And then they, they-replaced
your memories that you wouldn't

1:08:35.850 --> 1:08:37.885
know about our experiments.

1:08:53.835 --> 1:08:55.469
You set?

1:08:57.270 --> 1:08:58.405
Set to go.

1:08:59.807 --> 1:09:01.408
Target the boy?

1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:07.447
Take the shot.

1:09:12.587 --> 1:09:14.522
Take the shot.

1:09:19.694 --> 1:09:21.328
Take the shot.

1:09:24.832 --> 1:09:25.933
Now.

1:09:28.703 --> 1:09:30.337
No.

1:10:39.473 --> 1:10:40.641
Why did they do this to me?

1:10:42.577 --> 1:10:46.948
The didn't do it just to you.

1:10:46.981 --> 1:10:48.315
They did it to your whole team.

1:10:50.017 --> 1:10:53.320
You were the first group
of soldiers ever created.

1:10:54.622 --> 1:10:56.824
Who were designed specifically
to infiltrate

1:10:56.858 --> 1:10:58.826
and to become a part
of a society

1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:04.565
or community and then wait
to be activated, by them.

1:11:04.599 --> 1:11:05.700
For whatever means necessary.

1:11:11.839 --> 1:11:12.974
Then why clone me?

1:11:14.675 --> 1:11:16.811
Because you broke
from the program Mr. King.

1:11:16.844 --> 1:11:19.580
You broke with the program.

1:11:19.614 --> 1:11:20.581
You didn't obey orders.

1:11:21.783 --> 1:11:25.352
You see, when they
tell you to fire,

1:11:25.385 --> 1:11:26.554
you do it or they replace you.

1:11:29.724 --> 1:11:30.658
And Angel, why clone Angel?

1:11:33.761 --> 1:11:39.534
My employers are uh,
they're paranoid Mr. King.

1:11:39.567 --> 1:11:42.703
And they have a real,
need for secrecy.

1:11:44.404 --> 1:11:47.008
They wanted to know who it was
that you talked to about them,

1:11:47.041 --> 1:11:49.644
if you talked to
anyone about them.

1:11:49.677 --> 1:11:51.045
So they decided to
clone your friend.

1:11:52.847 --> 1:11:55.415
They figured that would
make you talk but it didn't.

1:11:55.448 --> 1:11:57.718
You didn't talk.

1:11:57.752 --> 1:12:01.421
And, believe me,

1:12:01.454 --> 1:12:03.456
they're going to turn to more
aggressive methods.

1:12:09.496 --> 1:12:10.463
Why did they kill the president?

1:12:14.902 --> 1:12:16.904
Look I uh.

1:12:16.938 --> 1:12:19.774
I've said too much, okay?

1:12:19.807 --> 1:12:23.010
Look just... just, take the
injection Mr. King please.

1:12:23.044 --> 1:12:24.011
What did they gain by it?

1:12:24.045 --> 1:12:25.613
Control?

1:12:25.646 --> 1:12:27.815
Control over what?

1:12:27.849 --> 1:12:28.616
Over who?

1:12:29.650 --> 1:12:32.419
I've said too much already
Mr. King

1:12:32.452 --> 1:12:33.921
please just take the injection.

1:12:33.955 --> 1:12:35.056
Who's behind all of this?

1:12:37.490 --> 1:12:38.893
Holy fucking shit man.

1:12:38.926 --> 1:12:39.894
Holy shit man what was that.

1:12:39.927 --> 1:12:41.095
Cut me loose, cut me loose.

1:12:41.128 --> 1:12:43.598
I don't want to be apart
of this cut me loose.

1:12:43.631 --> 1:12:44.999
Hell no get me out I
don't wanna die like this.

1:12:45.032 --> 1:12:47.568
Shh.

1:12:49.469 --> 1:12:51.906
C'mon out Luke,
it's time to end this.

1:12:54.942 --> 1:13:00.014
The doctor was the diplomatic
approach, the passive way.

1:13:00.047 --> 1:13:03.618
Our attempt, to use a
scalpel to fix the situation.

1:13:05.586 --> 1:13:07.420
Now we do things my way.

1:13:08.956 --> 1:13:12.793
Now you got 60 seconds to get
your ass out here, drop the gun,

1:13:12.827 --> 1:13:14.929
tell us what you know, and die.

1:13:15.930 --> 1:13:23.004
Or, I call in a drone attack and
incinerate this whole house,

1:13:23.037 --> 1:13:25.139
and go after everyone
you ever cared about.

1:13:27.942 --> 1:13:29.610
Your choice.

1:13:36.617 --> 1:13:37.985
Hey.

1:13:38.019 --> 1:13:39.553
Wait.

1:13:39.587 --> 1:13:41.454
I believe you.

1:13:41.488 --> 1:13:44.058
I can help you.

1:13:44.091 --> 1:13:45.226
C'mon, let me help you.

1:14:17.124 --> 1:14:18.125
Times up King.

1:14:20.728 --> 1:14:22.163
You the one that took the
shot at me in the park?

1:14:24.198 --> 1:14:26.033
If it was me you'd be dead.

1:14:27.034 --> 1:14:28.102
My guy missed.

1:14:29.136 --> 1:14:30.137
You ran.

1:14:31.105 --> 1:14:32.974
But I told you, there's
nowhere you can run from me.

1:14:34.942 --> 1:14:36.811
But I'm not running now am I?

1:14:36.844 --> 1:14:37.645
What do you want?

1:14:38.813 --> 1:14:41.282
I wanna know where we stand.

1:14:41.315 --> 1:14:45.786
Did you tell anybody about us?

1:14:45.820 --> 1:14:49.023
What about my employers,
are they secure?

1:14:53.995 --> 1:14:55.696
All you had to do was
go down with the bus.

1:14:57.798 --> 1:14:58.866
Why do you want me dead?

1:15:02.837 --> 1:15:03.871
Everyone of you say that.

1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:06.974
Who the hell are you?

1:15:09.243 --> 1:15:12.279
I saw you talking to the doc.

1:15:12.313 --> 1:15:14.915
You think you know, but you
don't know

1:15:14.949 --> 1:15:19.086
what the hell is going on.

1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:20.654
Been skipping your meds right?

1:15:22.089 --> 1:15:24.992
Starting to get headaches.

1:15:25.026 --> 1:15:27.294
Starting to see visions
of yourself doing chores.

1:15:29.263 --> 1:15:30.965
Starting to put it all together.

1:15:33.701 --> 1:15:37.805
Do you wanna know why I know
exactly what you're feeling?

1:15:37.838 --> 1:15:39.974
Because I've seen
it a dozen times,

1:15:40.007 --> 1:15:43.878
and I'm getting sick
and tired of it.

1:15:43.911 --> 1:15:45.279
It's a dance I've been
doing way too long.

1:15:47.381 --> 1:15:48.649
The doctor told me the truth.

1:15:51.152 --> 1:15:52.219
And what truth is that?

1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:54.989
He told me about the others.

1:15:57.725 --> 1:16:00.027
I will stop you.

1:16:00.061 --> 1:16:02.730
No more clones of me, or my
team to do your dirty work.

1:16:11.705 --> 1:16:13.874
Did the doc tell you that
you were the original?

1:16:13.908 --> 1:16:14.842
You killed the president.

1:16:14.875 --> 1:16:16.644
Please Mr. King
take the injection.

1:16:18.212 --> 1:16:21.749
The original Luke King, is dead.

1:16:21.782 --> 1:16:23.350
Please, it's the help...

1:16:23.384 --> 1:16:24.285
Take the injection!

1:16:24.318 --> 1:16:25.986
Enough!

1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:27.188
That's bull shit
I'm the original.

1:16:28.389 --> 1:16:31.992
Nah, no you're not.

1:16:32.026 --> 1:16:33.160
You're the clone my man.

1:16:36.130 --> 1:16:37.364
You may say it, but
that don't make it true.

1:16:39.834 --> 1:16:42.403
I'm you're Handler Mr. King.

1:16:42.436 --> 1:16:44.638
I'm the one who activates you.

1:16:44.672 --> 1:16:46.373
I'm the one who calls you.

1:16:46.407 --> 1:16:50.311
I'm the one who gives you a
trigger word

1:16:50.344 --> 1:16:54.148
and watches you kill.

1:16:54.181 --> 1:16:57.051
I'm your puppet master.

1:16:57.084 --> 1:16:58.352
Wanna guess who you are?

1:17:01.388 --> 1:17:02.723
You're the one making me
kill people aren't you.

1:17:16.270 --> 1:17:19.773
Of course I am.

1:17:19.807 --> 1:17:22.042
That's what you were made for.

1:17:22.076 --> 1:17:24.812
That's your designation.

1:17:24.845 --> 1:17:26.413
Sleeper soldier number 5.

1:17:29.917 --> 1:17:33.754
Its a damn shame
about that reporter.

1:17:33.787 --> 1:17:35.990
But I put that on you.

1:17:36.023 --> 1:17:39.960
You should've never
contacted her.

1:17:39.994 --> 1:17:43.964
If you would have just
kept your damn mouth shut.

1:17:43.998 --> 1:17:48.235
You'd still be living your
blissfully pathetic life.

1:17:48.269 --> 1:17:49.770
And still be our clone.

1:17:51.839 --> 1:17:52.973
And the people on the bus?

1:17:54.208 --> 1:17:55.042
What about them?

1:17:55.976 --> 1:17:57.144
They died for no reason.

1:17:57.678 --> 1:18:00.748
Again, you're fault.

1:18:00.781 --> 1:18:02.983
Those people should've
died with you,

1:18:03.017 --> 1:18:05.753
that was their purpose.

1:18:05.786 --> 1:18:08.856
You pull the trigger when I
tell you to pull the trigger.

1:18:08.889 --> 1:18:12.426
You don't get to
walk away from this.

1:18:12.459 --> 1:18:15.930
One word from me, and
you'll take that gun out,

1:18:15.963 --> 1:18:17.698
and blow your
fucking brains out.

1:18:18.999 --> 1:18:20.467
From here on out, I
make my own choices.

1:18:36.083 --> 1:18:38.118
Rosebud.

1:19:35.577 --> 1:19:37.344
Damn.

1:19:39.581 --> 1:19:40.515
He broke the cage.

1:20:39.507 --> 1:20:42.276
No.

1:20:42.309 --> 1:20:45.547
I can't be.

1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:47.081
Monroe?

1:21:16.544 --> 1:21:20.013
You're looking at the next
generation super soldier.

1:21:20.047 --> 1:21:21.415
Stronger.

1:21:21.448 --> 1:21:23.384
Faster.

1:21:23.417 --> 1:21:26.186
No weakness and no mercy.

1:21:28.523 --> 1:21:30.692
I don't have to turn him on.

1:21:30.725 --> 1:21:32.192
He stays on.

1:21:36.363 --> 1:21:37.565
I can't hurt him.

1:21:37.599 --> 1:21:38.298
I can't do it.

1:21:38.332 --> 1:21:41.502
I won't.

1:21:41.536 --> 1:21:42.936
If only he could see what I see.

1:21:46.340 --> 1:21:48.242
But he doesn't know what I know.

1:21:48.275 --> 1:21:49.309
They're still controlling him.

1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:00.454
I don't wanna hurt you brother.

1:22:00.487 --> 1:22:02.690
But he's still asleep.

1:22:02.724 --> 1:22:05.092
You can't break the
programming for him.

1:22:05.125 --> 1:22:06.594
He has to do it himself.

1:22:20.073 --> 1:22:21.341
Looks like you
forgot your training.

1:23:00.648 --> 1:23:02.249
Finish him.

1:23:02.282 --> 1:23:03.518
Now.

1:23:19.534 --> 1:23:20.768
Let's go!

1:24:15.255 --> 1:24:16.624
What the hell is
going on with you?

1:24:16.658 --> 1:24:18.392
Let's go.

1:24:18.425 --> 1:24:19.426
Finish him!

1:24:31.438 --> 1:24:32.507
Forgive me brother.

1:24:37.645 --> 1:24:38.680
May you awaken in the next life.

1:25:10.444 --> 1:25:12.346
C'mon.

1:25:14.882 --> 1:25:16.350
Luke.

1:25:16.383 --> 1:25:18.218
Luke let's go.

1:25:19.319 --> 1:25:21.623
Luke.

1:25:21.656 --> 1:25:22.690
Luke c'mon!

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:00.528
Stay put.

1:26:00.561 --> 1:26:01.228
But I can help you.

1:26:01.261 --> 1:26:02.664
You already did now stay put.

1:26:20.548 --> 1:26:21.516
Go around back.

1:28:07.088 --> 1:28:08.623
Looks like you do
remember your training.

1:29:34.108 --> 1:29:35.442
So you got him?

1:29:37.078 --> 1:29:38.646
I got him.

1:29:40.147 --> 1:29:41.616
What kind of dirt did
you have on 'em?

1:29:43.684 --> 1:29:46.053
Nothing.

1:29:46.087 --> 1:29:49.657
I was bluffing until the
doc spilled the beans.

1:29:49.690 --> 1:29:52.059
Now, I got everything I need.

1:29:59.934 --> 1:30:01.702
Hand it over.

1:30:06.507 --> 1:30:08.175
Give me the tape.

1:30:25.159 --> 1:30:26.527
Shi... target's on the move.

1:30:58.826 --> 1:31:02.495
Stop the car!

1:31:02.530 --> 1:31:03.898
Let him in.

1:31:06.867 --> 1:31:08.135
Open the door.

1:31:11.772 --> 1:31:13.207
Drive!

1:31:24.251 --> 1:31:26.153
Stay with him.

1:31:26.187 --> 1:31:27.788
And get him to talk.

1:31:27.822 --> 1:31:29.790
We'll follow.

1:31:44.739 --> 1:31:47.008
It's funny.

1:31:47.041 --> 1:31:49.944
Every agent in the
country looking for you,

1:31:49.977 --> 1:31:54.181
the most dangerous man
on the most wanted list.

1:31:54.215 --> 1:31:57.218
And I'm the one to bring you in.

1:31:57.251 --> 1:32:02.223
Problem for you is, they don't
want you brought in alive.

1:34:31.405 --> 1:34:35.042
I woke up to a war,
A war I didn't even know existed.

1:34:36.944 --> 1:34:39.446
Its not a physical war.

1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:43.017
Its a war of the mind,
a war of the spirit.

1:34:45.019 --> 1:34:47.254
Who's behind this?

1:34:47.288 --> 1:34:50.391
Everything they ever
told me is a lie.

1:34:50.424 --> 1:34:52.026
What are they trying
to keep me from?

1:34:54.328 --> 1:34:56.730
I don't know.

1:34:56.764 --> 1:34:59.800
But I can't be the only one.

1:34:59.833 --> 1:35:02.169
There has to be
others out there.

1:35:02.203 --> 1:35:04.371
I'll find them.

1:35:04.405 --> 1:35:08.108
From this moment on every breath
that I take is for the mission,

1:35:08.142 --> 1:35:11.378
the mission for the truth.

1:35:11.412 --> 1:35:14.014
This is the beginning.
