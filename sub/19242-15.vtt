WEBVTT

01:10.320 --> 01:11.529
How have you been?

01:19.287 --> 01:20.455
Ma-rin, are you home?

01:20.789 --> 01:21.873
<i>I'm busy right now.</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:29.214
What's going on?

01:29.839 --> 01:31.466
I told you that I'm busy.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.967
Where are you right now?

01:33.510 --> 01:36.096
Ma-rin... where is she?

01:36.471 --> 01:38.181
Think about it, you punk.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.600
I'm answering her phone
because she's with me.

01:40.892 --> 01:41.768
Isn't it obvious?

01:41.851 --> 01:43.144
Where are you!

01:43.728 --> 01:44.562
Hey...

01:47.440 --> 01:49.234
Let's meet, okay?

01:50.151 --> 01:53.029
I have your dashboard camera now.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.699
You better not call the police
if you have a thing called brain.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.992
I'll call you again.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.955
<i>Got it? The great Chairman Yu So-joon.</i>

02:02.413 --> 02:04.332
-Okay?
-<i>Hey, Kim Yong-jin.</i>

02:07.377 --> 02:08.378
Damn...

02:15.718 --> 02:17.428
Hey! So-joon.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.097
What happened?

02:20.181 --> 02:21.099
Were you too late?

02:21.182 --> 02:23.893
Ma-rin is with Kim Yong-jin right now.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.314
-I don't know where he took Ma-rin.
-I know where.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.066
I know everything.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.568
Then you should go there.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.946
Okay, I will catch him.
I'll get Kim Yong-jin.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.240
No, Ma-rin is with him.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.868
Don't put her life in danger.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.328
He will want to meet me anyway.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.957
When Kim Yong-jin leaves to meet me,
you can quietly save her.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.709
-So-joon.
-Kim Yong-jin won't notice.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.503
So-joon, you're not actually
going to meet him, are you?

02:51.337 --> 02:54.549
No, you can't do it! You cannot meet him.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.343
You said I originally get this evidence
taken away by him?

02:57.635 --> 02:58.970
Is this from the camera?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.222
Yes. He takes this from you.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.184
Then the first thing I need to do
is give this to the police.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.938
Did I get on the subway alone
after getting threatened by him?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.773
You had no choice
because of Ma-rin.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.567
That's how he managed to get away.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.905
I won't repeat the same mistakes again.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.866
I'm going to make sure
he gets arrested today.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.076
So-joon...

03:22.660 --> 03:24.495
You will be in danger.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.831
If we don't end this,
I'll be in danger tomorrow.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.959
We have to catch him now
while we have the chance.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.296
Go to Ma-rin now.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.883
Everything I just said
is only possible if you find her.

03:37.675 --> 03:38.968
You have to save her.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.803
I trust you.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.974
You are Ma-rin's father.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.547
YU SO-JOON

04:20.009 --> 04:22.011
What the heck?
You didn't even come to work.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.099
What do you mean?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.393
Kim Yong-jin took who?

04:34.565 --> 04:35.441
Are you okay?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.819
-You haven't heard from Ma-rin yet?
-No.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.072
-Take this and go to the police.
-What is it?

04:41.155 --> 04:42.782
Footage from Kim Yong-jin's camera.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.784
I haven't looked at it yet,

04:44.993 --> 04:46.160
and I can't be sure.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.956
But I think Kim Yong-jin had something
to do with Se-young's father.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.666
-What do you mean?
-This...

04:52.542 --> 04:53.626
could be proof of that.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.254
Explain it to me.
What about Se-young's father?

04:56.379 --> 04:57.755
Go straight to the police.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.301
Even if it turns out to be nothing,
we still need to catch Kim Yong-jin.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
I need to wrap my head
around this, So-joon.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.346
The police can't move first on this.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.142
If Kim Yong-jin realizes it and runs,
we may never catch him.

05:09.767 --> 05:13.855
I will hold him down first.
The police can come in after, okay?

06:10.745 --> 06:11.871
Let's take a look.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.664
Oh, it was this day.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.962
<i>That sounds like my phone.</i>

06:20.088 --> 06:21.089
Wait.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.133
<i>That sounds like my phone.</i>

06:24.300 --> 06:26.511
-That's Se-young's dad's voice.
-Se-young's dad?

06:27.178 --> 06:28.388
The chairman of Happiness.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.722
<i>Don't pick up.</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:30.932
Detective Kim.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.226
-What?
-Come here. Look at this.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.811
<i>Let's talk with me...</i>

06:34.894 --> 06:35.853
Hurry up.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.398
You're in charge
of the Happiness chairman case?

06:38.481 --> 06:40.775
-Yes, why?
-Listen to this. This is his voice.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.570
<i>This isn't the way to the airport.</i>

06:45.363 --> 06:47.824
<i>I heard you said some strange things</i>
<i>to President Choi.</i>

06:48.449 --> 06:50.952
<i>Please drop me off here.</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:53.246
<i>I'd like to go alone.</i>

06:55.164 --> 06:56.290
<i>Let's make a deal.</i>

06:58.000 --> 07:01.212
Yu So-joon. Listen carefully.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.882
If you want your wife back,

07:04.966 --> 07:06.968
you want to meet at Namyeong Station?

07:08.010 --> 07:09.887
Sure, let's do that.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.767
It really is amazing.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.812
You really can see the future, huh?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.690
<i>Last time...</i>

07:21.816 --> 07:23.901
<i>you vanished right in front of my eyes.</i>

07:24.735 --> 07:28.990
I was curious about who you were,
so I listened in on you and I know.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.825
You're no average person.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.870
<i>You're not a character</i>
<i>in a movie or comic book.</i>

07:33.953 --> 07:35.872
<i>You really are a weird thing.</i>

07:36.330 --> 07:40.126
Anyway, do you even know
how much they have to toil and suffer

07:40.626 --> 07:43.754
to have as much as you have?

07:44.213 --> 07:46.215
I have been so diligent in life.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.928
I suffered through so much pain.
I still couldn't have as much as you.

07:51.220 --> 07:55.308
Honestly, that seems so unfair,
and it fills me with rage!

07:56.350 --> 07:57.685
<i>You lazy punk.</i>

07:58.895 --> 08:01.397
You've lived a very easy life,
haven't you?

08:02.064 --> 08:04.984
So, you can endure this much suffering.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.527
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:10.364
Still, others don't become like you.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.494
Yeah, I know the future somewhat.

08:15.786 --> 08:19.332
Should I tell you the truth
about what happens to you?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.044
You...

08:24.045 --> 08:25.546
will get rid of me today.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.090
You succeed in running away.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.760
It's just how you wanted.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.099
Really? Thank you so much.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.186
You are really amazing, Chairman Yu.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.979
You know this
and will still meet me?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.565
Because I can't let that happen.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.444
I don't know what you're up to.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.990
My plan is to meet you
on the subway train today.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.494
Then get my dash camera files back,
so let's see what happens.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.580
You better bring them. Do you understand?

09:00.748 --> 09:02.542
Don't even think
about going the police.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.669
The moment you do,

09:05.127 --> 09:08.005
you won't ever see your wife again.
You got that?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.508
I asked you if you understood, you punk.

09:11.008 --> 09:14.720
<i>Even if the police catch me,</i>
<i>I won't ever tell them.</i>

09:15.346 --> 09:17.557
Then your wife will starve to death.

09:19.183 --> 09:23.437
Your wife will freeze to death.
She will die!

09:23.688 --> 09:24.939
<i>Hey, Kim Yong-jin.</i>

09:25.481 --> 09:27.149
Shut your mouth.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.527
Let's meet.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.997
Please save me.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.419
Please save me.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.674
Ma-rin!

09:52.341 --> 09:53.884
Ma-rin!

10:04.687 --> 10:06.731
Ma-rin!

10:10.318 --> 10:11.402
Who are you?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.654
Ma-rin, are you okay?

10:14.322 --> 10:15.406
Who are you?

10:16.907 --> 10:20.870
I'm your dad... your dad.

10:29.170 --> 10:33.132
<i>So-joon. I'm on my way</i>
<i>to the hospital with Ma-rin.</i>

10:33.966 --> 10:36.385
<i>Things are okay here, so don't worry.</i>

10:43.351 --> 10:44.268
Where are you?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.562
THE NEXT STATION IS NAMYEONG

10:49.190 --> 10:52.610
Get on this next train,
I'm on the second or third car.

10:53.569 --> 10:57.239
Let's see what happens now, you lazy punk.
See you soon.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.631
<i>I'll disappear</i>

11:14.006 --> 11:16.258
<i>in exactly 90 seconds once I get on.</i>

11:16.676 --> 11:19.470
<i>You need to catch Kim Yong-jin</i>
<i>within 90 seconds.</i>

11:22.223 --> 11:23.891
<i>The doors are opening.</i>

11:31.565 --> 11:33.442
Stay here, and don't follow us.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.694
I can come.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.410
INCOMING CALL

11:47.164 --> 11:50.334
I'm going toward the front.
Let's meet in the middle.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.336
Okay?

12:11.522 --> 12:15.401
<i>I followed myself on that day</i>
<i>to see what happens.</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:18.571
<i>I turned around and looked at myself.</i>

12:19.405 --> 12:21.782
<i>So, I went back the next day.</i>

12:23.075 --> 12:24.618
<i>Do you know what I saw?</i>

12:27.079 --> 12:28.247
<i>I saw me from the past.</i>

12:28.998 --> 12:31.459
<i>No, you'll complicate things</i>
<i>if you're here.</i>

12:44.722 --> 12:46.015
Yu So-joon?

12:47.641 --> 12:48.851
His clothes are different.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.442
Follow him anyway.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.366
Why are you running so much?
Are you anxious?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.841
Get out! All of you!

13:21.383 --> 13:22.635
You punk!

13:25.429 --> 13:26.722
Wait!

13:28.891 --> 13:30.142
You can't beat me.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.687
Even if I die by your hands,
you can't ever beat me.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.899
-Your life is already a failure.
-Shut your mouth!

13:39.318 --> 13:40.861
Bring me the dashboard camera.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.738
Live your whole life with nothing.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.033
No money, honor, family, friends,
with nothing.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.161
-Like garbage on the street!
-Damn you!

13:50.913 --> 13:52.248
Die!

14:04.718 --> 14:06.262
Die, you punk!

14:06.887 --> 14:08.305
You punk!

14:09.348 --> 14:10.224
Just die!

15:01.817 --> 15:04.028
-Move.
-Move!

15:04.737 --> 15:06.447
Quickly, move out of the way!

15:07.823 --> 15:08.782
Move!

15:10.451 --> 15:11.368
Freeze!

15:18.542 --> 15:21.420
Yu So-joon! Where is Yu So-joon?

15:23.297 --> 15:25.799
Where is Yu So-joon?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.096
He's gone.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.183
He left.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.269
He left.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.688
What are you saying? Where is Yu So-joon?

15:39.772 --> 15:43.108
Hey, where did he go? Answer us. Hey!

15:48.989 --> 15:51.283
Stop crying and answer us!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.871
She will wake up in an hour or two.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.749
She needs to rest,
so please watch over her.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.751
Yes, thank you.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.514
<i>Please meet with me when you go back.</i>

16:15.099 --> 16:16.600
<i>I think I missed you.</i>

16:25.526 --> 16:26.610
Wait.

16:29.613 --> 16:33.742
How did you know I was locked up in there?

16:36.912 --> 16:37.955
Dad.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.967
You said you were my dad...

16:51.802 --> 16:53.220
when you were carrying me here.

16:55.514 --> 17:00.853
Why don't you get some sleep first?
We can talk once you get up.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.188
Is this a dream?

17:05.983 --> 17:11.155
You never looked so vivid
in my dreams before.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.656
It's not a dream.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.454
I'm sorry for everything.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.956
I'm sorry.

17:27.838 --> 17:28.881
Song Ma-rin?

17:29.048 --> 17:32.134
-Who are you?
-I'm from the police.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.597
-It's about Kim Yong-jin--
-Did you arrest Kim Yong-jin?

17:37.097 --> 17:39.308
Yes, we arrested him on the scene.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.187
-Can I ask you a few things?
-Hold on.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.857
Can we talk outside?

17:47.357 --> 17:48.317
Who are you?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.236
Let's just step outside and talk.

17:52.321 --> 17:56.700
The doctor said
that she needs complete rest.

17:57.284 --> 17:58.660
Let's step outside.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.336
What's your relationship with the victim?

18:08.545 --> 18:09.713
She's my daughter.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.549
-Ah, I see.
-By the way...

18:13.842 --> 18:16.762
what happened to So-joon?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
His name is Yu So-joon.

18:19.473 --> 18:23.477
Ah, I don't really know
how to explain this.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.773
I don't know if I should call this
a missing person case.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.441
Did he disappear...

18:30.734 --> 18:31.777
from the subway?

18:33.904 --> 18:35.072
How did you know?

18:41.995 --> 18:45.457
Detective, why don't you go for today?

18:45.582 --> 18:46.542
Come back tomorrow.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.127
I need to ask Song Ma-rin a few--

18:48.210 --> 18:50.879
Please... She doesn't know anything.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.590
She needs to get better first.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.636
I beg you.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.556
REALTOR

19:00.681 --> 19:02.307
<i>Your phone is turned off.</i>

19:03.016 --> 19:05.769
<i>Are you looking for Kim Yong-jin,</i>
<i>by chance?</i>

19:06.812 --> 19:08.188
<i>They arrested him.</i>

19:09.064 --> 19:11.817
<i>Also, I'm in the hospital.</i>

19:13.152 --> 19:14.444
<i>I even met my dad.</i>

19:15.696 --> 19:17.406
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

19:17.865 --> 19:19.491
<i>So much is happening.</i>

19:21.034 --> 19:23.287
<i>Call me as soon as you see my messages.</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:29.918
Why are you sitting up like that?

19:30.627 --> 19:33.172
You should try to sleep.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.091
Oh, I was just sending some texts.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.139
I am married, you know?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.308
Oh, I see...

19:45.434 --> 19:48.437
I think he'd be worried,
but I can't reach him.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.361
Right... What did the detective say?

19:58.071 --> 20:00.449
Did he happen to meet my husband?

20:00.616 --> 20:02.868
He's at the police station right now.

20:03.076 --> 20:06.371
They're writing up a report.
They need to write up a report.

20:06.830 --> 20:10.000
Ah, that's why I couldn't contact him.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.049
He's a good person.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.930
He's warm, fun, and reliable.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.059
I'm living happily.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.228
Good.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.898
What happened today?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.568
-How did you find me?
-You should...

20:37.653 --> 20:39.738
take some rest today.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.823
Let's take our time talking.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.951
We have plenty of time.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.881
I'll admit to Chairman Shin Sung-kyu
and President Choi.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.091
What about Yu So-joon?

20:59.549 --> 21:01.843
How many times do I have to tell you?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.388
You have no evidence.

21:04.471 --> 21:08.016
If he's hurt, then bring him in.
If he's dead, then bring a body.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.768
You killed him, you bastard!

21:09.851 --> 21:13.146
-What are you doing?
-Let me go!

21:13.230 --> 21:15.315
-Take him away.
-You killed him!

21:15.399 --> 21:17.067
-Take him away.
-Let go of me!

21:17.150 --> 21:18.860
-Get him out of here!
-I'll kill you!

21:19.444 --> 21:20.445
Let go of me!

21:20.529 --> 21:23.699
Bring Yu So-joon, you punk.
Bring Yu So-joon!

21:23.782 --> 21:26.159
-Stop--
-I said bring him!

21:30.122 --> 21:32.124
Is he that busy at the police station?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.841
He should send me one message.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.757
<i>I think I should go home.</i>

22:22.674 --> 22:24.718
<i>This is my number, so please call me.</i>

22:25.344 --> 22:26.720
<i>I have a lot of questions.</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:35.979
Realtor.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.067
Is he not home yet?

22:47.741 --> 22:48.992
Are you home, Realtor?

22:58.877 --> 23:00.545
I hope he's eating well.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.300
He must be shocked about Se-young's dad.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.845
Gosh, how nice would it be
if I were a good cook?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.098
I could cook delicious food for him.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.312
Should I ask So-ri for some recipes?

23:18.188 --> 23:19.523
She's a good cook.

23:28.115 --> 23:28.990
Hello?

23:31.368 --> 23:32.452
The police?

23:34.538 --> 23:35.872
Who has gone missing?

23:40.961 --> 23:42.587
I think you're mistaken.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.133
I heard he went
to the police station yesterday.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.804
No, I think you're mistaken.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.546
I heard such strange news.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.470
How could the police not even figure out
the truth?

24:33.972 --> 24:35.390
How can I trust them now?

24:53.575 --> 24:54.534
Ki-doong.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.078
It's me.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.916
Ah, I just...

25:01.917 --> 25:05.420
heard something strange from the police.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.843
So-joon.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.060
So-joon...

25:23.230 --> 25:24.523
It's not true, right?

25:25.565 --> 25:27.943
They're wrong, aren't they?

25:28.401 --> 25:30.654
They said all these weird things.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.786
I think he went on the subway
to find out about some things.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.958
He doesn't know that Kim Yong-jin
has been caught, so he's looking into him.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.045
But, the police said all these things.

25:47.879 --> 25:48.922
Ki-doong.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.758
Ki-doong. It's not true, right?

25:53.218 --> 25:55.345
Those people are wrong, aren't they?

25:57.472 --> 25:58.723
He will be back.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.269
I know it's hard to believe.

26:04.145 --> 26:08.525
That's what happens to my husband
when he rides the subway.

26:09.734 --> 26:14.281
He vanishes like he was never there.
Then he just appears again.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.952
He even disappeared
right in front of my eyes.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.121
But...

26:22.747 --> 26:24.040
he appeared again.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.334
He's usually like that.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.466
Still, I don't know
about being a time traveler.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.760
I can't do anything
if you don't believe me.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.264
But, he is in another time right now.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.808
He must be worried
about what's going on.

26:42.434 --> 26:46.021
As I told you before,
the loss of blood was very severe--

26:46.104 --> 26:50.317
So, he must be getting treatment
in three or five years later from now.

26:51.735 --> 26:55.155
The medical treatment
must be more advanced in the future.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.742
When he's done getting treated,
he will come back.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.369
He always did.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.665
Ma-rin.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.251
-Where are you going?
-Ma-rin.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.921
Let's leave her alone.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.508
She must be very shocked.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.970
She keeps saying nonsense
about her husband being a time traveler.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.973
Does she normally say strange things
like that?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.141
What?

27:23.516 --> 27:26.019
Oh, about Yu So-joon...

27:26.269 --> 27:29.272
we are looking into all witnesses
and surrounding hospitals--

27:29.356 --> 27:30.607
You saw it too, Detective.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.651
Two people who looked like So-joon.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.235
I know.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.697
It's not like I was possessed by a ghost.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.950
What are you talking about?

27:53.755 --> 27:55.757
Are you saying
these are all from the future?

27:58.218 --> 28:01.971
He took a lot of it home,
so there's not much left.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.686
I knew So-joon had a secret.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.649
Everything makes sense now.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.154
Sorry for not telling you all this time.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.077
I heard...

28:26.329 --> 28:28.832
you beat up that murderer
at the police station.

28:31.626 --> 28:32.460
No.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.255
I couldn't beat him up.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.093
I'm sorry,

28:40.427 --> 28:44.431
but even if I ended up in prison,
I really wanted to kill him.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.021
I really am sorry.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.277
Why would you be sorry?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.364
I'm so relieved to have you.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.742
If I didn't have you...

29:05.618 --> 29:07.162
I couldn't get through it.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.751
So-joon will be okay, right?

29:14.627 --> 29:15.962
What will Ma-rin do?

29:19.090 --> 29:23.136
I'm worried she'll be aimlessly
wandering around looking for So-joon.

30:12.393 --> 30:13.770
That was the last train.

30:45.426 --> 30:46.719
So, all of this...

30:49.931 --> 30:51.933
So-joon prepared it in advance?

30:53.059 --> 30:54.018
Yes.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.187
Perhaps he sensed something.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.648
He asked me to give this to you

30:58.773 --> 31:01.109
if anything were to happen to him.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.361
I see.

31:04.487 --> 31:08.074
This states that until he returns...

31:08.324 --> 31:11.953
he will appoint Director Wang
as the president.

31:12.245 --> 31:15.331
Also, this is a contingency operation plan
for the company.

31:16.165 --> 31:17.584
Until he returns,

31:17.750 --> 31:21.337
he doesn't want to start any big projects
and strengthen the company foundation.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.466
It says that he'd prefer it
if the company stuck to safe projects.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.345
He knew it would be dangerous.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.851
He stupidly went on the subway that day.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.988
<i>Let's meet at your house</i>
<i>on December third this year.</i>

31:48.031 --> 31:49.699
I have something I need to ask you.

31:50.491 --> 31:54.162
You have to be home that day,
no matter what.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.414
I'll explain it to you on that day.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.476
Yes, Ki-doong.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.478
<i>I found a way to meet So-joon.</i>

32:19.228 --> 32:20.188
How?

32:20.772 --> 32:24.150
It's not today's So-joon,
but So-joon is still So-joon.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.111
What do you mean by that?

32:27.737 --> 32:30.323
<i>So-joon from the past will be coming.</i>

32:30.448 --> 32:31.908
He had made a promise with me.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.327
He's supposed to come on December third
to meet me.

32:34.452 --> 32:35.703
He had something to ask me.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.705
So...

32:39.040 --> 32:42.168
So-joon from the past will be coming
to see you tomorrow?

32:42.335 --> 32:45.672
<i>Yes, you can meet and tell him everything</i>
<i>about Kim Yong-jin.</i>

32:45.797 --> 32:47.298
We can stop this from happening.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.676
Then wouldn't the present change?

32:50.885 --> 32:52.679
You have to come meet So-joon tomorrow.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.015
Okay.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.282
Do you think we can talk for a bit?

33:24.919 --> 33:27.714
This is not a good time for me.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.465
Can we talk another time?

33:29.674 --> 33:32.427
So-joon won't come.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.100
How do you know So-joon?

33:41.644 --> 33:44.147
I've known So-joon for a long time.

33:45.481 --> 33:46.649
Since 2009...

33:50.278 --> 33:52.739
It's been a very long time now.

33:55.908 --> 33:59.037
I was on that subway train, too.

34:00.246 --> 34:01.914
At Namyeong Station.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.962
I saw you there.

34:08.921 --> 34:12.050
It's the same one from the stores.
It's 1,000 won for three of these.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.760
MARCH 25, 2009

34:13.843 --> 34:17.889
It's 3,000 won in the stores,
but I'm selling this set for 1,000 won.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.474
Take a look at it.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.434
-Mister.
-Yes?

34:21.684 --> 34:23.686
-Give me three.
-Three sets?

34:26.814 --> 34:29.484
-Thank you.
-I don't need the change.

34:30.610 --> 34:35.156
Oh, no. I'm not panhandling.
I'm running a business.

34:35.698 --> 34:36.908
Please use it well.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.869
We could wash shoes with these.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.706
It's three for 1,000 won.
On the back side...

34:44.749 --> 34:47.877
Hello, everyone. Sorry to bother you.

34:48.294 --> 34:52.215
I have these great toothbrushes.
They are three for 1,000 won.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.674
Did you just film me?

34:54.008 --> 34:55.510
It's usually one for 1,000 won--

34:55.593 --> 34:56.886
You just filmed me.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.472
Why would I do that?

34:59.555 --> 35:01.057
Why are you secretly filming me?

35:01.516 --> 35:02.975
I didn't secretly film you.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.393
Give me your phone.

35:04.727 --> 35:07.438
-What's with you? This is mine.
-Just show me so I know.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.524
-Let me see.
-You're really strange.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.401
Hey, isn't that Bap-soon?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.196
It is Bap-soon.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.576
Let's get off and confirm it.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.080
Do you think I'm scared?

35:24.789 --> 35:25.665
Ma-rin...

35:26.791 --> 35:29.001
Ma-rin! Ma-rin...

35:29.585 --> 35:31.379
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

35:33.798 --> 35:35.049
Thank you.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.761
What's with you? Show me your phone.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.390
Why would I take pictures of someone
I don't even know?

35:42.932 --> 35:44.267
I saw you do it.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.519
You were doing it secretively.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.729
I could show it to you,

35:48.813 --> 35:50.481
but I don't want to.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.275
You're annoying me.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.068
I can tell that you took a photo.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.320
Delete it now.

35:57.446 --> 35:59.282
There sure are a lot of weird people.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.783
-Hey!
-What?

36:00.908 --> 36:02.201
Delete it before you go.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.419
What was that?

36:17.842 --> 36:19.468
Where are you going?

36:19.635 --> 36:20.678
-Stop!
-Hey!

36:23.347 --> 36:24.265
What is he doing?

36:28.477 --> 36:29.520
Are you...

36:31.147 --> 36:32.398
the other...

36:33.566 --> 36:35.818
time traveler?

36:38.487 --> 36:42.241
Are you also the person
who helped So-joon and I meet?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.286
Yes, that's me.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.167
It breaks my heart...

36:52.168 --> 36:54.086
to say this, but...

36:55.171 --> 36:56.339
Ma-rin.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.635
So-joon is not coming back.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.889
Yes, he likely cannot come back.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.725
But, well...

37:08.309 --> 37:11.604
So-joon made this choice
knowing well what would happen.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.022
Why can't he come back?

37:14.565 --> 37:16.275
You said you can go to the future.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.904
Well... Can't you find him for me?

37:21.113 --> 37:22.198
Just...

37:22.740 --> 37:24.742
Just find out when and where he is.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.494
Is he hurt?

37:27.078 --> 37:29.914
Why can't he come back?
Can't you find him?

37:30.331 --> 37:31.499
He's gone.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.127
I looked for him, and he's gone.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.967
I'm really sorry to say these things
to you.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.010
But...

37:43.844 --> 37:47.098
So-joon won't be able to come back.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.475
So, you...

37:51.894 --> 37:52.728
You...

37:54.021 --> 37:57.316
should also accept that reality.
Start a new life.

37:59.819 --> 38:00.695
No...

38:02.154 --> 38:03.948
You suddenly appeared in my life.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.493
You tell me, "I was close to So-joon."

38:07.868 --> 38:09.370
"I know the future."

38:09.829 --> 38:12.081
"So-joon can't come back."

38:12.456 --> 38:15.501
Do you expect me to say
"Okay. I won't wait for him"?

38:16.252 --> 38:17.295
I'm sorry.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.214
You show up after 20 years.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.175
What are you saying right now?

38:24.510 --> 38:26.012
Just because you saved me once

38:26.637 --> 38:28.639
you can't say such a devastating thing
to me.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.225
You can't tell me what to do.
Who are you to do that?

38:31.851 --> 38:32.893
I'm sorry...

38:34.228 --> 38:36.397
You can see the future so clearly.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.775
You should have saved So-joon that day,
not me.

38:40.609 --> 38:43.738
You said you knew everything.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.699
Why didn't you save So-joon? Why?

38:55.458 --> 38:57.126
I need to see So-joon.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.088
Find him now.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.682
Help me, help me...

39:26.072 --> 39:27.156
So-ri.

39:28.657 --> 39:29.950
I'm scared.

39:30.868 --> 39:31.869
Wake up.

39:32.119 --> 39:33.746
What's wrong?

39:34.705 --> 39:35.873
Gosh.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.310
Gosh.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.336
Hey, why did you scream?

40:27.383 --> 40:30.845
I think you need to see a psychiatrist.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.390
I'm so scared.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.059
It gives me the creeps.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.105
I can't believe it.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.572
He even kidnapped Ma-rin.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.033
What if something had happened to her?

40:54.243 --> 40:56.829
I don't know what to say either.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.542
He wouldn't come to kill me too, would he?

41:03.919 --> 41:05.463
Hey. Let's run away.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.507
Why would I have to?

41:08.632 --> 41:11.302
I'm so scared. I can't live alone.

41:11.385 --> 41:13.721
Let's run away together, So-ri.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.195
I feel so bad that I can't pick up.

41:29.778 --> 41:33.115
Just pick up.
She must have something to say.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.329
BAP-SOON

41:42.458 --> 41:43.459
Yeah.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.211
Gun-sook.

41:46.295 --> 41:49.131
<i>I heard everything at the police station.</i>

41:49.423 --> 41:50.466
<i>Are you okay?</i>

41:51.717 --> 41:53.969
About So-joon's accident...

41:55.095 --> 41:56.639
who did you tell?

41:56.931 --> 41:59.183
<i>So far, just So-ri.</i>

42:00.935 --> 42:04.688
From now on,
what happened to him is a secret.

42:05.439 --> 42:07.566
Huh? Why?

42:08.108 --> 42:09.318
<i>Just do that for me.</i>

42:09.985 --> 42:12.321
Tell So-ri to keep it to herself too.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.492
Tell her not to tell my mom either.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.746
Let her know that.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.333
And you can't ever tell anyone, okay?

42:26.001 --> 42:28.212
Okay, I understand.

42:28.754 --> 42:29.588
<i>Bye now.</i>

42:31.882 --> 42:32.883
Okay.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.052
<i>You have to come meet So-joon tomorrow.</i>

43:29.356 --> 43:31.442
Ma-rin, So-joon is not here yet.

43:31.775 --> 43:32.776
Come in.

43:43.954 --> 43:47.791
If the past changes,
I don't know how the present will change.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.501
Once So-joon gets here...

43:50.461 --> 43:53.088
let's help him
so he can stop it from happening.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.424
-So it never happens to him.
-No.

43:58.010 --> 44:00.012
You should meet him alone, Ki-doong.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.808
You're not going to meet So-joon today?

44:05.476 --> 44:07.770
Even if we tell him about Kim Yong-jin...

44:09.480 --> 44:11.482
they will get mixed up in a bad way.

44:13.275 --> 44:15.027
He will be in danger again.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.405
Once So-joon gets here...

44:19.657 --> 44:20.658
just tell him

44:22.785 --> 44:24.787
that he went abroad,

44:25.663 --> 44:27.665
and that's why no one could reach him.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.209
I think that would be best.

44:31.752 --> 44:32.753
What?

44:33.879 --> 44:36.507
Tell him our relationship was so bad.

44:38.258 --> 44:41.387
He got so sick of it,
and that's why he left.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.601
Tell him to break up with me
as soon as possible.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.232
What are you saying, Ma-rin?

44:53.565 --> 44:54.483
So-joon.

44:57.194 --> 45:00.114
He told me that we were never
meant to meet, to begin with.

45:02.116 --> 45:04.118
He was supposed to live freely alone.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.206
His future changed once he met me.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.877
The incident with Kim Yong-jin, as well.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.882
-He isn't supposed to go through this.
-No...

45:20.134 --> 45:23.929
Ma-rin.
Stop blaming yourself. It's not like that.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.014
Just explain things to him this time--

45:26.098 --> 45:27.891
He knew, and he still got hurt.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.189
I thought about it all night.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.401
I only have one answer.

45:41.071 --> 45:44.032
It's right to return things
to the way they were before he met me.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.952
So...

45:48.120 --> 45:52.624
tell him to break up with me quickly
once he returns.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.257
Tell him...

46:05.387 --> 46:06.972
we were so unhappy.

46:10.309 --> 46:13.187
So, tell him to end things quickly.
Can you do that?

46:14.062 --> 46:16.482
I think that's how we can save So-joon.

46:45.636 --> 46:46.929
<i>You really came.</i>

46:48.972 --> 46:51.433
You know who I am, right?

46:52.100 --> 46:52.976
Yes.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.396
We agreed to meet on December third.

46:58.982 --> 47:02.277
It's awkward meeting you like this.

47:03.362 --> 47:04.822
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

47:09.493 --> 47:11.954
<i>I disappeared, Ki-doong.</i>

47:12.621 --> 47:14.039
<i>What happened to me?</i>

47:15.541 --> 47:17.000
<i>You went abroad.</i>

47:18.293 --> 47:19.545
<i>You broke up with Ma-rin.</i>

47:21.755 --> 47:22.589
What?

47:22.714 --> 47:25.467
Things weren't good between you two
since you got married.

47:27.261 --> 47:30.597
Wait. Are you sure you're not mistaken?

47:31.306 --> 47:32.808
You're not fooling me, are you?

47:33.225 --> 47:34.560
I wouldn't do that.

47:35.644 --> 47:39.690
No matter how bad my relationship got
with Ma-rin,

47:40.357 --> 47:42.359
I would never run off on my own.

47:42.776 --> 47:44.820
There's a reason
why I could never do that.

47:44.903 --> 47:45.737
So-joon, I...

47:46.446 --> 47:48.657
I'm very sorry to tell you this.

47:49.825 --> 47:52.244
You should go back now
and break up with Ma-rin.

47:52.953 --> 47:54.955
For your sake and Ma-rin's sake.

47:56.123 --> 47:57.749
This is all I can say to you.

47:58.375 --> 47:59.835
Don't say that nonsense.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.059
Hey!

49:00.395 --> 49:01.647
Are you hurt?

49:01.855 --> 49:03.649
Miss, are you okay?

49:03.774 --> 49:04.942
-I'm okay.
-Yeah?

49:05.233 --> 49:06.193
Thank you.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.278
Wait.

49:09.571 --> 49:11.573
Where have I seen you before?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.492
I've seen your face before.

49:15.535 --> 49:18.163
Oh, you're Bap-soon!

49:19.206 --> 49:21.583
Bap-soon! Bap-soon!

49:22.209 --> 49:23.669
-What?
-Leave quietly.

49:24.753 --> 49:27.130
What? Who are you?

49:46.525 --> 49:48.527
I should've just seen him.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.657
I should've seen him from the distance.

50:30.235 --> 50:31.570
<i>He came and left.</i>

50:32.988 --> 50:34.406
<i>I do have good news.</i>

50:35.323 --> 50:39.453
<i>The fact that So-joon came from the past</i>
<i>means that So-joon is alive now.</i>

50:40.120 --> 50:42.622
<i>He told me long ago,</i>
<i>but I just remembered now.</i>

50:44.249 --> 50:47.711
<i>He can only travel within times</i>
<i>where he is still alive.</i>

50:48.795 --> 50:51.298
<i>So-joon is definitely alive.</i>

51:18.909 --> 51:20.660
ONE MONTH LATER

51:20.744 --> 51:23.121
-Are you meeting Ma-rin's dad again?
-Goodness.

51:23.497 --> 51:26.792
He keeps asking to meet lately.
It's such a pain.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.503
You look really happy about it to me.

51:29.669 --> 51:32.631
Why don't you two get back together?

51:32.756 --> 51:34.758
Why would I?

51:35.425 --> 51:36.343
I'll get going.

51:37.511 --> 51:40.305
Stop swaying your hips.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.432
My goodness.

51:53.151 --> 51:54.820
Oh, right.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.116
Here you go.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.661
This is really hard to get.

52:02.828 --> 52:04.663
Don't give it to anyone else.

52:06.164 --> 52:07.624
Don't show it to anyone.

52:08.667 --> 52:12.254
-Only you should eat it.
-Gosh, what is it?

52:15.257 --> 52:17.259
OHRI RAMEN

52:17.884 --> 52:18.844
Seriously?

52:19.594 --> 52:21.847
I'm sick of this.
I wondered what it was.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.474
Do you have friends in research too?

52:25.809 --> 52:27.435
I didn't even graduate high school.

52:27.978 --> 52:31.022
You called me over here
to give me some ramen?

52:31.148 --> 52:32.607
This situation is uncomfortable.

52:34.025 --> 52:35.360
It's the thought that counts.

52:35.902 --> 52:39.531
Oh, right… I have something to say.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.870
I'm not trying to argue with you.

52:45.245 --> 52:47.497
Don't get angry, okay?

52:48.456 --> 52:49.416
Well...

52:51.293 --> 52:55.130
It seems like you told Ma-rin
a lot of big lies about me.

52:55.630 --> 52:56.548
What about?

52:57.757 --> 53:01.094
Well... You told her

53:01.636 --> 53:04.514
that I hit on you
when you were just 20 and innocent.

53:04.598 --> 53:05.640
It's true, isn't it?

53:06.725 --> 53:09.519
-You're looking all innocent.
-What's wrong?

53:12.856 --> 53:15.192
Remember, I was only 17 back then.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.820
You seduced
an innocent high school student.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.907
Honestly, you were the biggest bully
in Naju.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.242
I was scared of you and ran away,
but got caught.

53:24.326 --> 53:26.453
I couldn't graduate high school
because of you.

53:26.536 --> 53:28.580
Stop exaggerating that I'm older!

53:30.624 --> 53:32.584
You lied about your age
at the night club.

53:33.126 --> 53:36.713
Is this why you came looking for me?
You're bringing up the past as an excuse.

53:36.796 --> 53:39.174
Then you're going to try
and sway my feelings.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.634
What are you saying?

53:41.176 --> 53:44.638
I was just worried about Ma-rin.

53:45.805 --> 53:49.309
You're using Ma-rin as an excuse
to hit on me.

53:49.392 --> 53:51.144
That's so old-fashioned.

53:52.187 --> 53:54.814
You're not old, are you?
I'm not old either.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.651
So, be cool and let it all out.

53:58.777 --> 54:01.988
Let what out? Your voice is so...

54:02.739 --> 54:07.118
I came here simply because
I was worried about Ma-rin.

54:07.202 --> 54:08.745
Ma-rin is doing well.

54:09.412 --> 54:13.500
So-joon is in the US to look at land,
so now they will become rich.

54:14.626 --> 54:15.710
Her life is just great.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.964
She's here and there to learn something,
going to shows, or vacations.

54:19.297 --> 54:22.050
She's been so busy
that I haven't been able to see her.

54:23.551 --> 54:26.471
-Do you call her often?
-I told you, she's really busy.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.890
Then you don't even call her
when she's all alone?

54:28.974 --> 54:32.060
You appeared all of a sudden,
and now you're acting like a dad.

54:32.143 --> 54:36.898
You're her mom and she's all alone.
You should call her often and visit.

54:37.774 --> 54:38.858
There she goes again.

55:11.057 --> 55:12.267
Hey, Mom.

55:15.270 --> 55:18.982
No, I'm on my way out now to take photos.

55:21.609 --> 55:23.737
Even if you come now, I can't meet you.

55:23.820 --> 55:25.071
I'll finish late.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.284
Why would I be avoiding you?

55:30.827 --> 55:32.620
Yes, I am on my way out.

55:38.251 --> 55:39.586
You heard the door, right?

55:40.670 --> 55:42.130
I told you I was on my way out.

55:43.798 --> 55:45.800
I'll call you another time.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.928
So-joon is doing well too.

55:49.679 --> 55:51.181
I'll call you later.

56:03.526 --> 56:04.861
How bothersome.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.889
FROM: YU SO-JOON
TO: SONG MA-RIN

56:45.527 --> 56:46.861
<i>To Song Ma-rin in the future.</i>

56:48.988 --> 56:50.990
<i>Hi, Future Song Ma-rin.</i>

56:52.867 --> 56:54.702
<i>It is October, 2016.</i>

56:55.161 --> 56:58.164
<i>We are on the trip to the sea</i>
<i>before Se-young leaves.</i>

56:58.248 --> 56:59.874
I haven't written a letter in ages.

57:00.041 --> 57:04.504
<i>Just now, you sent me</i>
<i>a pretty picture of yourself.</i>

57:05.964 --> 57:09.092
<i>You do not know I'm a time traveler yet.</i>

57:09.676 --> 57:11.136
<i>We are really happy these days.</i>

57:12.512 --> 57:14.806
<i>I wish I couldn't travel to the future.</i>

57:15.390 --> 57:18.935
<i>I wish I could freeze time instead.</i>

57:19.936 --> 57:21.813
<i>I pray that when you receive this letter,</i>

57:22.689 --> 57:24.566
<i>you will not be hating me.</i>

57:27.360 --> 57:31.739
<i>Even if our future days are unhappy</i>
<i>I am satisfied with what we have now.</i>

57:33.491 --> 57:36.035
<i>If I had to go back to the past</i>
<i>and make my choice again</i>

57:37.203 --> 57:38.037
<i>I...</i>

57:38.997 --> 57:39.998
<i>choose you.</i>

57:41.249 --> 57:44.252
<i>Please don't forget our precious memories.</i>

57:45.128 --> 57:47.505
<i>Your husband, So-joon.</i>

58:18.995 --> 58:20.705
Why didn't I think of this?

58:22.373 --> 58:26.127
I can schedule emails to be sent later,
he can read them in the future.

58:33.718 --> 58:34.594
<i>Hi.</i>

58:35.720 --> 58:39.807
<i>I just received the letter you sent</i>
<i>while we were at sea, and I'm replying.</i>

58:41.100 --> 58:43.770
<i>Will you be able to read it</i>
<i>if I send it to one year later?</i>

58:44.771 --> 58:45.939
<i>Or two years later?</i>

58:47.023 --> 58:49.776
<i>Or later than that?</i>

58:50.693 --> 58:53.863
Yes, my husband is cooking ramen
right now.

58:53.947 --> 58:55.949
Should we see what kind of ramen it is?

58:56.533 --> 58:58.535
Okay, Yu So-joon.

58:58.910 --> 59:01.538
-Oh my.
-What kind of ramen are you making?

59:01.621 --> 59:04.207
I'm about to make Ohri Ramen.

59:04.290 --> 59:06.209
Of course, Ohri Ramen is the best.

59:07.710 --> 59:08.670
All right, then.

59:09.170 --> 59:10.255
Now. Let's go.

59:11.756 --> 59:12.840
Hurry.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.009
Here we go.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.513
-This is boring. Let's switch.
-Okay.

59:20.473 --> 59:21.808
<i>I told you in the past</i>

59:23.101 --> 59:24.686
<i>to break up with me.</i>

59:26.646 --> 59:29.315
<i>Yet, I'm waiting for you in the future</i>
<i>to come back to me.</i>

59:31.025 --> 59:33.778
<i>Even if it takes one year or two years...</i>

59:34.404 --> 59:35.280
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

59:36.948 --> 59:40.285
<i>I believe, waiting for you is</i>
<i>part of my love towards you.</i>

59:41.995 --> 59:45.373
<i>I'll cherish my memories with you.</i>

59:46.874 --> 59:49.377
<i>I'll dream of the moment we meet again.</i>

59:51.045 --> 59:55.008
<i>I'll hope you're well wherever you are.</i>

59:56.718 --> 1:00:00.346
<i>Even if you are 10 years, 20 years,</i>
<i>or 30 years away,</i>

1:00:00.763 --> 1:00:02.432
<i>I'll be waiting for you right here.</i>

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:05.226

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:09.606

TWO YEARS LATER
FEBRUARY, 2019

1:00:48.561 --> 1:00:50.855
-I think it's a little dark here.
-Okay.

1:00:52.065 --> 1:00:53.483
-That's perfect.
-All right.

1:00:53.566 --> 1:00:54.484
Thank you.

1:00:56.944 --> 1:00:59.197
Ma-rin, you have guests.

1:00:59.364 --> 1:01:00.365
Guests?

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:03.660
-Photographer Song.
-Congratulations.

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:05.870
Congratulations on your first exhibition.

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:07.538
Wow! Looks cool.

1:01:07.705 --> 1:01:10.625
It's not open yet.
Why did you come so early?

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:12.752
We should help out a fellow family member.

1:01:12.877 --> 1:01:14.379
Do you need help with anything?

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:16.964
Can you help me with something?

1:01:17.048 --> 1:01:20.093
-Pardon?
-I have to lift something heavy.

1:01:20.259 --> 1:01:22.345
Oh, of course. I'll be back.

1:01:22.512 --> 1:01:24.514
-Sorry to ask, but how old are you?
-Huh?

1:01:24.597 --> 1:01:26.599
You look like a very nice person.

1:01:26.974 --> 1:01:28.893
What am I going to do with her?

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:34.232
She's in a rush lately,
so she goes nuts over any man.

1:01:34.941 --> 1:01:37.235
She's going to embarrass herself
one of these days.

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:38.403
She's unbelievable.

1:01:39.028 --> 1:01:41.656
Here you go. How are preparations going?

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:44.575
Thank you, Se-young.

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:47.787
Well, preparations are coming along.

1:01:48.621 --> 1:01:50.998
You're promoting Happiness quite a bit.

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:55.128
I was able to get a lot of good pictures
from Happiness.

1:01:56.629 --> 1:01:59.590
You really look
like a proper photographer now.

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:02.677
-You're a little awkward.
-A little awkward?

1:02:03.219 --> 1:02:07.515
It's not like a photographer has it
written on their face photographer.

1:02:09.434 --> 1:02:11.978
You should look around.
I'm going to check on something.

1:02:12.061 --> 1:02:13.479
-Okay.
-Thank you for this.

1:02:32.832 --> 1:02:38.963
