00:06.089 --> 00:07.881
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?

00:08.048 --> 00:09.591
- Yeah.
Mm-hm.

00:09.759 --> 00:12.177
Yeah. What was I thinking?

00:12.887 --> 00:17.599
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip?
Did I do something wrong?

00:19.060 --> 00:21.061
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.398
You know what's more generous than that?
Fifty percent.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.777
- You know what's even more generous?
- I see where you're going.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.613
- What's up with the greed, Joe?
- All right, look, I'm sorry, you guys.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.367
It's just that I gotta get
these new headshots made...

00:35.535 --> 00:37.494
...and they're really expensive, you know.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.621
I'm down to like three.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.542
Actually, two, because one of them
I kind of blackened in some teeth.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.878
Why'd I do that? Ugh.

00:46.087 --> 00:49.298
Well, isn't there something you can do
to earn a little extra money?

00:49.466 --> 00:52.551
I mean, can't you pick up,
I don't know, an extra shift here?

00:52.719 --> 00:55.888
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.

00:57.682 --> 01:01.310
Of course, it helps if you've got,
you know, a little of this going on.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.979
- Wow, I still have it. Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.858
Wait, don't you have an audition today?
Yeah. Maybe you'll get that job.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.109
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.446
Oh, wait a minute.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.449
I used to get medical experiments
done on me all the time.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.036
Ah, finally, an explanation.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.831
No, I used to get paid
for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?

01:22.999 --> 01:27.336
Let's see. Uh...
Well, I don't wanna donate sperm again.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.422
I really prefer doing that at the home office,
you know?

01:30.590 --> 01:34.676
Ooh, ooh, maybe they want some
of my blood or spit or something, huh?

01:34.886 --> 01:36.220
- Joey.
- Yeah?

01:36.387 --> 01:39.598
What did I tell you about talking
to your friends while you're working?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.183
Uh, do it?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.561
That guy's been waiting for his coffee
for 10 minutes.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.397
He's complained about you three times.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.235
Now, where was I?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.026
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.238
- Hey, what have you been up to?
- Oh. We went to a self-defense class today.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.447
Wow.

02:37.615 --> 02:41.535
Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch
all morning really takes it out of you.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.996
Takes it out of you? Heh.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.624
- No, now we can kick anybody's ass.
- Yeah.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.043
After one class? I don't think so.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.921
What, you wanna see me
self-defend myself?

02:53.089 --> 02:55.424
Go over there
and pretend you're a sexual predator.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.342
Go on, I dare you.

02:58.094 --> 03:01.930
Of course you can defend yourself
from an attack you know is coming.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.932
That's not enough.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.394
Look, I studied karate for a long time.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.690
And there's a concept
you should really be familiar with.

03:11.858 --> 03:16.236
It's what the Japanese call unagi.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.990
Isn't that a kind of sushi?

03:21.242 --> 03:25.329
- No, it's a concept.
- Yeah, it is, it is. It's freshwater eel.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.456
All right, maybe it means that too.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.751
Oh, I would kill
for a salmon-skin roll right now.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.172
You know what? Fine, get attacked.
I don't even care.

03:35.340 --> 03:39.092
Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
Please tell us what it is.

03:41.387 --> 03:46.391
Unagi is a state of total awareness.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.186
Okay? Only by achieving true unagi...

03:49.354 --> 03:53.941
...can you be prepared
for any danger that may befall you.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.402
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...

03:57.570 --> 03:58.612
...or your kettle of fish?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.702
All I'm saying is,
it's one thing being prepared...

04:05.870 --> 04:07.871
...for an attack against, like, each other.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.874
Whole other story being prepared
for an attack, I don't know...

04:11.042 --> 04:12.834
A surprise!

04:20.635 --> 04:26.265
All right, you knew that was coming,
but that doesn't mean you have unagi.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.771
Ooh, if we made reservations,
we could have unagi in about a half-hour.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.523
You know what?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.443
- Hey, hey, is Monica here?
- No.

04:38.611 --> 04:42.197
Okay, look, I need your help.
I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.

04:42.365 --> 04:47.119
Well, Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.

04:47.328 --> 04:51.456
Heh. She was working on Valentine's Day,
so we're celebrating it tonight.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.877
Oh, hey, why don't you book a day for both
of you at one of those romantic spas?

04:56.045 --> 04:58.463
Ooh, Joey,
that's actually a really good idea.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.717
Yeah, and of course, crotchless panties.

05:04.095 --> 05:07.014
Well, as appealing as that does sound
to her boyfriend...

05:07.181 --> 05:09.182
...and her brother...

05:12.520 --> 05:15.522
...I can't. We promised
we'd make each other gifts this year.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.024
- Oh, I love that.
- You guys.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.526
You can't make crotchless panties?
You take...

05:21.154 --> 05:24.698
- You take a pair of scissors and just cut...
- Okay, okay, okay.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.576
So making things,
that sounds so much fun.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.038
I thought so too,
until I papier-mâchéd one of my eyes shut.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.957
I love papier-mâché. What did you make?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.167
I made a:

05:37.587 --> 05:39.087
- What is that?
- Nothing.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.464
Oh.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.799
So, what are you gonna do?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.802
Have you guys made anything
that I could take credit for?

05:45.970 --> 05:49.556
Ooh, I have, I have.
I started making these little sock bunnies.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.933
Oh, for crying out loud.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.979
Hey, wait a minute. That is my sock.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.524
Now it's your little bunny friend.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.745
Okay.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.501
This actually is a:

06:21.172 --> 06:22.464
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.258
Can I ask you a question
about the Valentine's Day gifts?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.969
- Oh, yeah.
- Do we have to make the entire thing?

06:28.513 --> 06:30.806
Yes. Why, did you forget to make yours?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.767
Of course not.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.772
I just have to, uh, go over to the place
where I made it and pick it up.

06:38.940 --> 06:39.981
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.401
I can't wait.
It's gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.782
I can't believe it.
Make the presents. Make the presents.

06:49.575 --> 06:53.286
- What?
- Just so excited to make the presents!

06:57.792 --> 06:59.418
Shoot.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.964
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.967
And with all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.263
We're at the end
of one of our research cycles...

07:11.431 --> 07:13.473
...so we're not looking
for applicants now.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.226
That's too bad.
I've kind of been saving up.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.191
Uh, you sure there's no studies
I can participate in?

07:23.401 --> 07:25.444
Well, here's a schedule
of what's coming up.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.195
Ah, thanks.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.239
Oh, but this one starts now.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.409
That one is available now,
but only identical twins are eligible.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.245
- It's a twin study.
- But it's $2000.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.248
- Sorry.
- Oh.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.084
Well, how about this one?

07:41.252 --> 07:46.673
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
on Attractive Nurse Receptionists."

07:47.592 --> 07:51.386
We already got the results back
on that one, and they're not good.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.350
- That was good.
- Wasn't that a blast?

07:57.518 --> 08:00.770
- Danger! Danger!
- God, Ross!

08:04.233 --> 08:06.443
What the hell was that?

08:06.611 --> 08:10.697
A lesson in the importance of unagi.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.993
You're a freak.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.245
Perhaps.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.081
Now, I'm curious.

08:20.249 --> 08:25.629
At what point during those girlish screams
would you have begun to kick my ass?

08:27.757 --> 08:30.550
All right, so we weren't prepared.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.429
I'm sorry I had to take
such drastic measures to make my point.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.765
But, look,
I just want you guys to be safe.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.308
Oh...

08:39.477 --> 08:41.645
Danger!

08:45.274 --> 08:48.985
Ah, huh? Unagi.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.827
Two thousand bucks is a lot of money.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.413
Boy, I wish I had a twin.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.041
Where could I find someone...

09:03.209 --> 09:06.962
...who looks exactly like me?

09:26.732 --> 09:27.816
Hey.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.776
Chandler.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.655
I sensed it was you.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.992
What?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.160
Unagi.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.705
I'm always aware.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.833
Okay, are you aware that unagi is an eel?

09:46.711 --> 09:49.462
- What's up?
- I can't figure out what to make Monica.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.048
Oh. Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.550
I'm going crazy, okay?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.219
Do you have anything around here
that looks homemade?

09:57.096 --> 09:59.723
Oh, you know what? She'd love this.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.310
It's an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.

10:04.645 --> 10:08.273
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon."

10:08.441 --> 10:11.651
Yeah, yeah. Except Apollo 8
didn't actually land on the moon.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.986
But you could write, um:

10:13.154 --> 10:18.199
"Your love lets me orbit the moon twice
and return safely."

10:19.577 --> 10:21.036
Wait, I can't give this to her.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.205
- Why not?
- It says "Captain Ross" on the side.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.960
- And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
- Oh.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.884
- Danger!
- Aah!

10:40.890 --> 10:45.018
Ah. Salmon-skin roll.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.316
Okay, okay.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.707
Yes, honey, I made it myself.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.099
I can't do it. I can't do it.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.772
Oh, oh. A mixed tape. A mixed tape.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.566
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.653
- You ready to exchange gifts?
- Sure. Okay, you go first.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.405
- Okay, come here, come here.
- Okay.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.700
Okay, now, it's not wrapped,
because I just finished it.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.159
Okay.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.913
But I made you a tape
of what I think are all romantic songs.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.250
What a great gift.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.585
Oh.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.338
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?

11:58.008 --> 12:00.051
Maybe. We'll have to listen and see.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.305
- Oh, I love it. Thank you so much. Mwah.
- Aw. Okay. Mwah.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.224
Okay, you ready to open yours?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.393
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.239
It's a sock bunny.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.159
Ha, ha. Yeah, yeah.
Remember how I call you "bunny"?

12:25.035 --> 12:26.786
Not really.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.124
Well, I did one time.
And I wanna start doing it more.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.461
- That's what this is about.
- I see.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.130
You know, um,
Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.339
No. No, she doesn't.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.009
Phoebe, what she makes, that's...
They're sock rabbits.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.720
They're completely different. Okay, okay.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.307
Okay, I didn't make it. I'm sorry.
I totally forgot about tonight...

12:47.475 --> 12:49.768
...and that we were supposed
to make the presents.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.896
- Oh, it's okay. I don't...
- No, no, it's not okay. It's not.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.564
I mean, you're so incredible.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.777
You went through all this time
and effort to make this tape for me.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.239
You know, I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna make this up to you. I will.

13:03.407 --> 13:07.577
I am going to cook you anything you want
in here.

13:07.745 --> 13:12.332
And I'm going to do anything you want
in there.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.545
Well, I did put a lot of thought
into the tape.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.473
Wow.

13:31.894 --> 13:36.439
- You are way too young to have seen that.
- Oops. Ha, ha.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.483
Your birthday's in a month and a half.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.985
What do you say I forget
to get you a present for that too?

13:42.404 --> 13:46.199
You are totally and completely
100 percent forgiven.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.993
- We have got to wash that.
- Yeah.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.708
Hey, do you remember that jacket
that you loved so much...

13:55.876 --> 13:59.337
...that you thought was too expensive?
- You have done enough.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.090
Ha, ha. I'm gonna wake up early
and get it for you.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.425
No, you don't have...
Get it in black, not brown.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.347
- Oop. Your cake is ready.
- Oop.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.311
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake."

14:19.525 --> 14:22.443
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.242
Who the hell are you?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.786
I'm Joey.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.539
How are you doing?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.002
No, no, no!

14:39.169 --> 14:40.753
"How you doing?"

14:42.506 --> 14:45.091
"How you doing?"
Damn it, Carl. Go wait in the hall.

14:51.599 --> 14:56.477
- Look, I got to apologize on behalf of Carl.
- Who the hell is Carl?

14:57.062 --> 14:58.271
Oh, did I not mention?

14:59.523 --> 15:05.153
Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin
for a medical research project.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.618
You know, sometimes the good ideas
are just right in front of you, aren't they?

15:11.785 --> 15:14.370
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but I think it might work.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.998
But the only problem is Carl's acting is:

15:17.166 --> 15:19.417
The only problem?

15:20.169 --> 15:23.963
Yeah. He's the reason I didn't get
that big Minute Maid commercial.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.050
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed it up.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.844
Hey. Can I get a little piece of that cake?

15:30.054 --> 15:33.014
Pizza. We like pizza. Get out!

15:41.148 --> 15:43.274
- Pat Sajak?
- Yep.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.318
- Alex Trebek?
- Oh, of course.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.195
- Chuck Woolery?
- Definitely.

15:47.363 --> 15:51.407
Phoebe, you will not find
a single game-show host...

15:51.575 --> 15:53.242
...whose ass I cannot kick.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.046
- Say it.
- Say we are unagi.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.717
It's not something you are,
it's something you have.

16:10.761 --> 16:11.803
Say it.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.638
I could easily get out of this...

16:13.806 --> 16:17.767
...but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt.

16:30.406 --> 16:34.701
All right, Carl, we're next.
Now, remember, what is this not gonna be?

16:34.868 --> 16:37.787
- Another Minute Maid fiasco.
- That's right.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.372
And what are you not gonna do?

16:39.540 --> 16:43.292
- I'm not gonna talk, because...
- Ah. Damn it, Carl.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.549
Can I have the next one, please?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.134
Thank you.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.344
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.887
That's us.

16:55.055 --> 16:58.516
But, uh, this is a study
for identical twins.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.103
That's right. Two thousand dollars.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.605
But you're not identical twins.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.109
Damn it, Carl.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.036
Oh, my good God.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.790
Hey. Continuing the countdown
of your favorite meals.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.752
Tonight, number three:

17:27.296 --> 17:30.798
Macaroni and cheese
with cut-up hot dogs.

17:32.551 --> 17:36.012
Look, you have done enough, okay?
You have to stop this now.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.056
I will, but not tonight.

17:38.223 --> 17:42.560
For dinner music, I thought we could listen
to that tape that you made me.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.520
- Oh, the mixed tape.
- Mm-hm.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.735
When I'm awfully low

17:51.945 --> 17:55.907
Oh. "The Way You Look Tonight"
is on here.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.325
Dance with me.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.578
I will feel a glow

18:00.746 --> 18:05.708
Just thinking of you

18:07.878 --> 18:12.590
And the way you look tonight

18:16.136 --> 18:19.055
You are just the sweetest.

18:21.225 --> 18:26.854
I love the way
you look every night, Chandler.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.361
That's why I made you this tape.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.907
Happy birthday. Love, Janice. Mwah.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.206
No, you're the sweetest.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.050
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class.
Let's remember, let's be safe out there.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.017
- Great class. Heh.
- Thanks, man.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.061
Yeah, yeah. I was watching.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.400
Um, hey, a couple of questions, though.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.153
Um, you know that last move...

19:15.320 --> 19:18.406
...where that woman tripped you
and then pinned you to the floor?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.074
What would you do next?

19:20.242 --> 19:22.785
Well, then she'd take her keys
and jam them in your...

19:22.953 --> 19:25.997
No, no, no. What would you do next?

19:26.165 --> 19:29.083
- Who, me, the attacker?
- Yes, that's right.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.294
Why?

19:31.461 --> 19:35.047
I tried attacking two women.
Did not work.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.341
- What?
- No, I mean, it's okay.

19:37.509 --> 19:42.305
I mean, they're my friends.
In fact, I was married to one of them.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.849
Let me get this straight.
You attacked your ex-wife?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.768
Oh, no, no, no. Heh.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.896
I tried.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.567
But I couldn't. That's why I'm here.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.695
Maybe we could attack them together.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.908
That's a no.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.996
I am so, so, so sorry.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.165
Uh-huh.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.670
Oh! And I will cook anything you want
in here...

20:14.838 --> 20:18.633
...and do anything you want in there.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.095
Yeah, you will, and are you kidding me?

20:25.515 --> 20:28.476
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.811
Please, please, please?

20:33.106 --> 20:36.025
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:39.821 --> 20:45.243
My funny valentine

20:45.410 --> 20:49.956
Sweet comic valentine
You make me...

20:50.123 --> 20:53.668
- So are we going in there?
- I am.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.966
Your looks are laughable

21:07.057 --> 21:08.474
Aha.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.811
Nowhere to run.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.315
I don't like sitting up here.
I'm gonna go over...

21:16.483 --> 21:18.150
No, Rachel, they got here first.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.704
- Why is Ross doing that?
- Danger!

21:29.871 --> 21:34.709
Oh, my God.
Why is he jumping on those women?

21:36.003 --> 21:38.170
We should help them.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.548
I don't think they need any help.
