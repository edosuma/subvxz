00:01.100 --> 00:02.700
<i>Hi. I'm Chuck.
Here's a few things</i>

00:02.701 --> 00:03.700
<i>that you might need to know.</i>

00:03.701 --> 00:04.965
This is General Beckman
of the NSA.

00:04.966 --> 00:07.167
I am calling to say...

00:07.233 --> 00:10.701
That you are officially a member
of Operation Bartowski.

00:10.767 --> 00:12.466
I think we're gonna need
a few more days in Paris.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.634
No. I want you back ASAP.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:50.900 --> 00:52.499
<i>Bon soir, Madame.</i>

00:52.500 --> 00:55.267
Compartment service.
So sorry to bother you...

00:55.334 --> 00:56.599
Right. I'll take
it from here.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.800
Thank you.
But wait. Uh,

00:57.801 --> 01:00.133
wouldn't you prefer
for me to carve?

01:00.200 --> 01:01.865
I'm pretty good
with knives. Ah.

01:01.866 --> 01:03.199
Will there be anything else?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.399
Actually. You know what?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.300
I think we have
everything we need. Ah.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.333
Very good, monsieur.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.199
<i>Merci.
Bon soir.</i>

01:09.200 --> 01:11.200
* *

01:25.400 --> 01:28.334
Good afternoon
yet again, monsieur.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.733
<i>Merci.</i>

01:29.734 --> 01:31.466
You do know, we have
a full dining car

01:31.467 --> 01:32.633
at the rear of the train.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.932
Yes. Uh, we're just...

01:33.933 --> 01:35.499
We quite like it in here.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.400
Uh-uh.
So...

01:38.467 --> 01:39.999
Hey.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.900
So you really

01:41.933 --> 01:43.633
don't have a favorite band?

01:43.634 --> 01:44.733
I don't...
I can't...

01:44.734 --> 01:46.132
Everybody's got
a favorite band.

01:46.133 --> 01:48.233
What's your favorite live show?
We'll start there.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.132
Music has not been
at the top of my list.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.100
Oh, is that right? Oh.

01:53.334 --> 01:55.199
Is that so?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.167
Well, okay, music.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.832
Something that we can work on.

01:58.833 --> 02:01.100
Although, that would require us
leaving this compartment,

02:01.167 --> 02:03.434
and I'm not sure
how I feel about that.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.400
No.
I...

02:13.734 --> 02:15.767
Beckman expected us
back in Burbank today.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.933
So did Ellie and
Casey and Devon.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.865
We can't just run
away like this.

02:19.866 --> 02:22.100
Why not?

02:22.167 --> 02:23.666
Chuck...

02:23.667 --> 02:24.832
Casey's been reinstated,

02:24.833 --> 02:26.666
Ellie and Awesome
are going to Africa.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.734
Everyone else is moving forward
with their life.

02:28.801 --> 02:31.534
Sarah, for the first time
since I've known you,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.500
nothing is holding us back.

02:33.534 --> 02:37.801
And if Beckman finds out,
she could stop all of this, us.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.499
I can't risk that. I won't.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.965
You're right.

02:40.966 --> 02:43.367
I can't go back to
how it was before.

02:43.434 --> 02:45.667
Before this, before you.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.966
We should do what I should
have done in Prague.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.199
We should run.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.300
But, Chuck,
is that what you really want?

02:54.367 --> 02:56.267
I want you.

02:57.267 --> 03:00.667
Sarah Walker, do you agree
to quit the spy life with me?

03:02.634 --> 03:04.534
I do.

03:04.567 --> 03:07.634
Chuck Bartowski, do you agree
to quit the spy life with me?

03:07.701 --> 03:09.601
I do.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.700
<i>Agents Walker and Bartowski</i>

03:17.701 --> 03:19.601
haven't checked in
since the Shaw incident.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.833
They were to report back here
at 0800 today.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.734
As far as the U.S. government
is concerned, they're AWOL.

03:25.801 --> 03:27.833
Well, we'll need access
to Interpol sat imaging.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.066
Our uplink's...

03:29.067 --> 03:31.000
We've been down that path,
Colonel.

03:31.067 --> 03:34.233
I'm coming to you because
you have access to...

03:34.300 --> 03:37.334
A unique resource.

03:39.233 --> 03:40.800
The Intersect and Mr. Grimes

03:40.801 --> 03:44.866
have an oddly
codependent relationship.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.833
I need to know
if they're in communication.

03:46.868 --> 03:48.801
Use him to find Chuck.

03:53.534 --> 03:57.033
Devon, what are these?

03:57.100 --> 03:58.666
Babe,

03:58.667 --> 03:59.932
this didn't happen by accident.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.032
Okay, well, they're not

04:01.033 --> 04:03.000
coming with us to Africa.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.766
Don't worry, babe.

04:08.767 --> 04:11.267
I'm sure Chuck will be
at our going-away party.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.533
It's fine.

04:12.534 --> 04:14.667
It's fine. If he shows up,
he shows up.

04:14.734 --> 04:16.031
If he doesn't...

04:16.033 --> 04:17.865
You know, I'm sure
whatever he's doing

04:17.866 --> 04:20.132
at Buy More Corporate
is very important.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.899
Well, I see

04:28.900 --> 04:31.367
you finally made it out
of your compartment,

04:31.434 --> 04:33.667
Mr. and Mrs...

04:33.734 --> 04:35.299
Charles Carmi... Charles.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.634
Charles Charles is the name.

04:37.701 --> 04:39.132
We are the Charles.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.832
Charles-ezez.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.266
We-We're on our honeymoon.

04:42.267 --> 04:42.965
Huh.

04:42.966 --> 04:44.399
Mrs. Charles.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.534
<i>Ah. EnchantÃ©.</i>

04:46.600 --> 04:47.766
Enjoy.

04:47.767 --> 04:49.199
<i>Merci.
Merci.</i>

04:49.200 --> 04:52.801
I- I... I blew that cover story,
didn't I?

04:52.866 --> 04:54.499
I think the honeymoon bit
might have been too much.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.766
Was it? It probably was.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.767
I should have just said
we were dating exclusively.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.466
I mean,
that's a fair assumption, right?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.367
Chuck, we're running away
together.

05:04.801 --> 05:07.500
Man, pastries for breakfast
every morning.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.266
Europe is genius.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.567
Of course you're probably used
to this stuff, right?

05:11.634 --> 05:14.833
Well, I may have a lot of stamps
in my passport, but I think

05:14.900 --> 05:17.367
this is the first time that
I'm actually seeing the place.

05:17.434 --> 05:19.434
Well, where do we begin?

05:19.500 --> 05:22.500
We can go anywhere,
be anyone, do anything.

05:22.567 --> 05:25.400
Well, we could go skiing
in the Alps.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.099
I don't know.
Could be painful.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.667
Although, we could also catch
a bunch of great concerts.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.366
That could be fun.

05:36.367 --> 05:39.434
And, uh, if we get tired
of Europe, there is

05:39.500 --> 05:40.633
always...

05:40.634 --> 05:42.534
Canada.

05:42.933 --> 05:46.033
No matter where we go
or what we do...

05:46.100 --> 05:48.000
As long as we're together,
right?

05:53.033 --> 05:55.434
Raspberry and chocolate chips.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.801
Charge this to
room 47B, please.

06:17.866 --> 06:22.167
To not being spies.

06:26.063 --> 06:30.644
Transcript by www.addic7ed.com

07:08.467 --> 07:09.966
Casey, I'm telling you, I
haven't heard from Chuck,

07:09.967 --> 07:12.183
and he hasn't updated his
Facebook status in over a week.

07:12.218 --> 07:14.400
Which I can only assume means,
well, that he's prob...

07:14.467 --> 07:16.100
Probably something
pretty important, right?

07:16.101 --> 07:17.432
Let's cut the man some slack.

07:17.433 --> 07:19.165
He's got the world's
fate resting in his hands.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.767
Oh, I'd say he's got something
else resting in his hands.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.165
What do you mean?

07:23.166 --> 07:25.600
Chuck's off-grid with Walker.
Do the math, Grimes.

07:25.667 --> 07:29.400
He's going to need a walker
when Walker's through with him.

07:29.467 --> 07:31.734
They're having
intercourse, idiot.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.332
<i>Oh. Oh. Got you.
Say no more.</i>

07:33.333 --> 07:34.499
Ah.
Good for Chuck.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.132
Well, shouldn't be
too hard to find then.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.699
And yes, I will assist you.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.033
I happen to be

07:39.034 --> 07:41.433
the Intersect of
Chuck, so... Oh. Hey.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.734
You seen Chuck? I was just
going to ask you the same thing.

07:45.034 --> 07:47.500
So, where's Chuck?

07:47.567 --> 07:49.432
You are on
a need-to-know basis.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.367
Dude.

07:51.433 --> 07:53.265
Well, good thing
you came to me,

07:53.266 --> 07:56.400
as I have been tasked
to bring him back, so...

07:56.467 --> 07:58.066
Back? Back?
Back from where?

07:58.067 --> 08:00.001
Well, probably better
you don't know.

08:00.067 --> 08:01.466
Whatever. But you know
the going-away party

08:01.467 --> 08:03.000
I'm having for me
and Ellie tomorrow night?

08:03.001 --> 08:04.466
Yes, sure.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.066
No matter what she says,
it will kill her

08:06.067 --> 08:08.001
if Chuck's not there to say
good-bye, so make it happen.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.833
Somebody say Bat Mitzvah?

08:09.834 --> 08:11.199
Hey.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.467
No. Party.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.433
You know, there's a lengthy
Hebrew translation

08:15.500 --> 08:17.332
I'm not gonna get into,

08:17.333 --> 08:19.433
but in the olden days,
Bat Mitzvah meant,

08:19.500 --> 08:21.400
"party hard

08:21.467 --> 08:23.332
'cause your daughter's
almost ripe for plucking."

08:23.333 --> 08:24.499
Oh.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.332
Oh, my.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.599
I miss the olden days.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.800
I'm gonna assume
our invitations

08:28.867 --> 08:30.767
got lost in the mail.
Jeffster!...

08:31.567 --> 08:32.732
...formally accepts.

08:32.734 --> 08:34.599
Ha!

08:34.600 --> 08:38.799
Our manager, by which I mean me,
will be in touch.

08:42.567 --> 08:44.934
I can't believe it.

08:45.001 --> 08:47.567
We're really out
of the spy game.

08:47.634 --> 08:49.867
Yeah. Yeah,
it's gonna be tough

08:49.934 --> 08:53.233
to just turn off
this old head of mine.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.799
I know what you mean.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.001
It's kind of second nature.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.233
So, theoretically,
if I were to flash,

09:02.300 --> 09:03.699
I'd just ignore it.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.100
That's what we decided, right?

09:05.101 --> 09:06.466
Right.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.834
Right, just a couple
of regular people blending in.

09:11.067 --> 09:14.001
Just a couple of regular people
doing regular things.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.666
Nothing heroic.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.967
Exactly.

09:20.034 --> 09:23.200
'Cause that's what
you wanted, right?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.066
Of course.

09:39.367 --> 09:43.400
Maybe I'll just get some fresh air.
You know, I could use some ice cream.

09:43.467 --> 09:45.265
You want to go get it?

09:45.266 --> 09:46.399
No, you can get it.
You can get it.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.733
I'll get fresh air right here.

09:47.734 --> 09:49.834
Good. You know, I'll just
open the window, you know.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.299
There's nothing like some

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
nice Swiss air to
get the blood pumping.

09:53.367 --> 09:55.265
You know what I mean? Oh! Oh!

09:55.266 --> 09:56.466
Oh, that's cold.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.299
That is brisk, but refreshing.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.200
Ah, I'll be right back.

10:30.034 --> 10:31.666
Juan Arnaldo.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.166
He's a Basque terrorist.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.600
What on earth are they planning?

10:40.367 --> 10:42.400
Oh, damn it.

10:51.533 --> 10:53.567
* *

11:03.667 --> 11:05.366
Names, dates.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.267
What are they up to?

11:41.001 --> 11:43.634
What are y'all doing

11:43.700 --> 11:45.232
in my room?

11:45.233 --> 11:46.633
My husband is going

11:46.634 --> 11:48.534
to kick your behinds!

11:51.001 --> 11:52.633
This is my compartment.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.600
Though I'd be happy to show you

11:54.667 --> 11:56.165
to wherever you are going.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.833
Oh!

11:57.834 --> 11:59.466
I'm so embarrassed.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.400
<i>Perdon, lo siento!</i>

12:01.467 --> 12:05.067
All these rooms look the same
six drinks in.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.867
We do everything big in Texas.

12:07.934 --> 12:08.933
I can see that.

12:08.934 --> 12:09.699
Right.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.000
Well, I'll be on my way.

12:11.001 --> 12:12.901
<i>Perdon.</i>

12:45.166 --> 12:46.399
Was just doing
some calisthenics.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.733
You know? I can't
let myself go

12:47.734 --> 12:48.833
now that I got the girl.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.734
Right.

12:55.533 --> 12:57.199
Oh, yeah.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.166
Yeah.

13:07.266 --> 13:09.867
You know, Chuck,
I can't fake this.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.466
Not with you.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.332
What?

13:13.333 --> 13:14.899
You've been faking it
the whole time?

13:14.900 --> 13:16.265
No, no, no, not that.

13:16.266 --> 13:17.966
I spotted a Basque
terrorist on board.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.165
Juan...
Diego Arnaldo!

13:19.166 --> 13:20.833
I know, I flashed on him.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.834
He has a whole list
of names in his room.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.433
Yeah, all of his contacts from
the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.034
Oh, my God, you even make
terrorist groups sound sexy.

13:28.101 --> 13:30.166
So, you were the one
I was hiding from.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.233
You were the one
in the bathroom?

13:36.067 --> 13:38.300
You know, Juan Diego Arnaldo
is a terrorist.

13:38.367 --> 13:41.001
After all, it would
be irresponsible...

13:41.067 --> 13:43.734
Even criminal to turn
our backs on this.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.067
One last mission before we quit?

13:46.133 --> 13:48.133
One last mission.

13:54.866 --> 13:56.299
Let me get this straight.
Last time you saw Chuck

13:56.300 --> 13:58.099
was in Paris?
Quiet.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.067
Well, hey, you asked me
for my help.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.601
No, I was tasked to ask
for your help.

14:02.667 --> 14:03.700
There's a big difference.

14:03.701 --> 14:05.032
Tomato tomahto, John.
Listen to me.

14:05.033 --> 14:06.666
You're looking for a needle
in a haystack

14:06.667 --> 14:07.700
made of needles.

14:07.701 --> 14:09.634
You need to create
an advantage.

14:09.701 --> 14:10.832
That's me.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.132
You know, it can take up
to seven minutes

14:12.133 --> 14:13.865
to strangle someone to death.

14:13.866 --> 14:15.732
I've done it
in under 30 seconds.

14:15.733 --> 14:17.667
Wow.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.267
See, I thought John Casey
wasn't scared of anything.

14:20.334 --> 14:21.700
I'm not.

14:21.701 --> 14:23.900
Then why are you so scared
to ask for my help?

14:23.967 --> 14:25.967
Huh?

14:27.833 --> 14:29.333
Go.

14:29.334 --> 14:31.667
All right, looks like we have
an Oracle based system here.

14:31.733 --> 14:34.567
Okay. It's just
I've been studying

14:34.634 --> 14:36.399
this particular subject
for over 20 years.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.634
I think I know a
thing or two. Mm-hmm.

14:38.701 --> 14:41.833
I noticed that Chuck left behind
his eczema moisturizing cream,

14:41.900 --> 14:43.132
which he needs
a prescription for.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.100
Dr. Feldman,
our dermatologist,

14:46.167 --> 14:50.467
would've had to call
into a pharmacy.

14:50.534 --> 14:52.434
Montparnasse.

14:52.567 --> 14:53.832
Near the train station.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.366
Ah, let me see
if I can find out

14:55.367 --> 14:57.334
what day he picked it up.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.567
Okay, April 15, so let's

14:59.634 --> 15:01.333
cross-check that
with the train station

15:01.334 --> 15:02.832
security camera footage.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.267
This is going to be tough.

15:05.334 --> 15:08.167
Yeah, see? This is why we
leave the spy work to the spies.

15:08.234 --> 15:10.234
Uh-uh-uh- not yet, not yet.
Listen to me.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.799
Chuck's a hard-core
DC Comic's guy.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.701
And Sarah, I know, Sarah-
my boy's not leaving Paris

15:13.766 --> 15:15.667
<i>without the latest issue
of Justice League. What?</i>

15:15.733 --> 15:18.701
Now, where's the nearest
magazine stand?

15:20.100 --> 15:22.534
There. There.
Bingo.

15:22.601 --> 15:24.499
Huh, there he is.
There's our boy.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.400
Just see if we can
zoom in on the ticket.

15:27.766 --> 15:29.433
Gotcha.

15:29.434 --> 15:31.334
They're en route to Zurich.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.033
Make sure your passport's
up to date.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.000
Pack light.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.566
Wait a minute.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.166
I'm traveling to Europe
on the government's dime?

15:41.167 --> 15:43.067
Champagne,

15:43.100 --> 15:45.267
langostino,
fully reclining seats...

15:45.334 --> 15:47.701
First class, here I come, baby.

15:55.334 --> 15:58.400
Casey, I get
nervous feelings when I fly.

15:58.467 --> 15:59.966
Yeah, I know.
Big job ahead of us.

15:59.967 --> 16:01.299
Get some sleep.
Can't.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.334
You see, in my head,
the only way

16:03.400 --> 16:05.300
the plane remains aloft
is if I'm rooting for it.

16:05.334 --> 16:07.866
So, stands to reason
if I'm sleeping,

16:07.933 --> 16:09.833
I'm not rooting.

16:12.167 --> 16:13.600
Whatever, nut job.

16:13.601 --> 16:16.234
But you wake me, you'll be
the only one that dies.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.467
If we can subdue
Arnaldo and his men,

16:25.534 --> 16:27.366
and leave them cuffed
at the next station...

16:27.367 --> 16:29.800
We can place an anonymous call
to Interpol to pick them up.

16:29.866 --> 16:31.833
Bad guys delivered.
Day saved.

16:33.434 --> 16:36.000
Then we can finally start
living our real lives together.

16:36.067 --> 16:38.234
Right?
Right.

16:40.701 --> 16:42.566
So, what's the plan?

16:42.567 --> 16:44.467
We left all of our
spy gear in Paris.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.701
Oh, hey. Sorry, man.

16:59.766 --> 17:01.499
Ride on the train's
a little bumpy.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.865
You know, I've even
had a couple drinks.

17:02.866 --> 17:05.000
Take it easy.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.165
<i>Oui?</i>

17:21.166 --> 17:23.067
<i>Yeah? Oui?</i>

17:24.067 --> 17:25.566
<i>TrÃ¨s bien.</i>

17:25.567 --> 17:26.999
<i>Vive la France.</i>

17:27.000 --> 17:29.567
Au revoir.

17:29.634 --> 17:32.766
Well, they already know me
as a drunken newlywed.

17:32.833 --> 17:34.199
It's about time they met

17:34.200 --> 17:36.933
my handsome husband.
What do you say, tiger?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.533
Well, I do believe,

17:38.534 --> 17:42.300
you are correct,
Mrs. Charles.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.800
Although, I can't help feeling
like we're missing something.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.066
Is all that really necessary?

17:55.067 --> 17:57.367
Every world traveler knows that
he should own a sturdy rucksack.

17:57.434 --> 17:59.500
Oh, what's with the stupid maple
leaf patch? Every American also knows

17:59.567 --> 18:01.333
to act Canadian
as to be well-liked.

18:01.334 --> 18:02.999
That's a clichÃ©.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
We're on a mission,
not a vacation.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.700
Well, I'm sorry.
I've never been to Europe.

18:06.701 --> 18:08.701
I've barely been south
of Redondo Beach.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.701
Bonjour.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.500
Ticket, please.
Oh, right. Sorry.

18:16.933 --> 18:18.299
What are you doing?
Hold on.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.200
Don't worry.
My ticket is in my super secret

18:20.267 --> 18:21.799
money pouch.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.700
There you go.

18:23.701 --> 18:25.601
Hey, trains and
buses are hotbeds

18:25.634 --> 18:27.534
for gypsy activities.
Staying alert.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.166
Thank you.

18:30.167 --> 18:32.701
You check the sleeping
compartments, I got the dining car.

18:32.766 --> 18:34.666
Move.
Copy that.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.633
Whoa. Casey?

18:40.400 --> 18:41.466
Up you go.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.367
Okay.

18:49.601 --> 18:51.501
* *

18:57.967 --> 18:59.867
<i>Gracias, senor.</i>

19:03.567 --> 19:05.933
Oh, my God!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.133
Hi, y'all. It's me.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.100
Remember me?
I was in y'alls room.

19:10.101 --> 19:12.766
Oh, I don't suppose you would
mind taking a picture

19:12.833 --> 19:15.234
of me and my husband?
It's our honeymoon.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.234
Yes, it is.
Oh!

19:17.300 --> 19:18.366
Oh, dear.
Oh, my God.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.466
I am so sorry.

19:19.467 --> 19:20.899
Charlie, baby, look what I did.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.333
I made an oopsie.

19:22.334 --> 19:23.466
It's no problem, my dear.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.400
Like you say, you
only honeymoon once.

19:25.467 --> 19:26.832
This man speaks the truth.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.766
Hey, but still,
apologies nonetheless.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.633
Mr. Charles
and Mrs. Charles.

19:30.634 --> 19:32.634
We are the Charleses.
The Charlesezez.

19:32.701 --> 19:34.499
Well, either way,
Charlie Charles

19:34.500 --> 19:36.266
does not spill a man's
drink onto a man's

19:36.267 --> 19:39.200
cheese tray and not buy
a man another drink.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.567
So why don't I just go ahead
and get you some freshies

19:41.634 --> 19:43.132
and maybe another
cheese tray to boot?

19:43.133 --> 19:45.267
Oh, isn't he just a sweetheart?

19:45.334 --> 19:47.234
I mean, isn't that...

19:53.200 --> 19:56.800
Attention Mr. and Mrs.
Whatever-your-last-name-is.

19:56.866 --> 19:58.266
Why do they need a rehearsal?

19:58.267 --> 20:01.067
Prepare yourself to be
wowed by a Wall of Sound.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.033
Sound, sound.

20:08.334 --> 20:10.933
What was that?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.633
Damn it, Jeffrey,
you blew the amp.

20:12.634 --> 20:13.999
Don't you know
that it's not the size

20:14.000 --> 20:15.633
of the instrument that matters,
but how much and how long

20:15.634 --> 20:16.966
and how often your mother
catches you playing?

20:16.967 --> 20:21.167
You know who can fix that amp
in two seconds? Chuck.

20:22.267 --> 20:23.765
Guys, I really think

20:23.766 --> 20:25.666
you can handle it. No,
we definitely need Chuck.

20:25.701 --> 20:27.601
We don't need Chuck! Okay?

20:28.701 --> 20:30.399
Sorry.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.865
We're just...

20:31.866 --> 20:34.500
We're going to figuresomething e

20:38.133 --> 20:40.133
Go get our turtlenecks.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.267
Tonight...

20:43.334 --> 20:45.967
Jeffster! goes unplugged.

20:46.033 --> 20:48.133
Um, Lester, that's lime juice.

20:51.766 --> 20:53.666
<i>Vive la France.</i>

20:54.200 --> 20:55.932
Here we are.

20:55.933 --> 20:57.099
Sorry about the inconvenience.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.333
Here's your three

20:58.334 --> 20:59.932
fresh beverages for
you, gentlemen.

20:59.933 --> 21:01.433
Now, if you don't mind,

21:01.434 --> 21:03.701
I'm going to steal my pretty,
little wife back from you,

21:03.766 --> 21:05.967
'cause it's been a speck
of time since I whispered

21:06.033 --> 21:08.033
sweet nothings in my gal's ear.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.865
Come on, now.
She is a tigress.

21:09.866 --> 21:11.766
A tigress! She just
comes at you.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.299
Come on, baby.
Let's go have some fun.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.600
Bye.
Y'all have a good trip, now.

21:14.601 --> 21:16.501
Okay.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.300
Well, cheers!

21:21.534 --> 21:22.799
You know, uh,

21:22.800 --> 21:24.266
I know this is
our last mission,

21:24.267 --> 21:27.434
but we make a great
team, Mrs. Charles.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.200
I'm thinking the same
thing, Mr. Charles.

21:33.534 --> 21:35.534
CASEY Oh, God.

21:39.634 --> 21:41.166
Casey?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.399
What are you doing here?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.233
Putting to rest any stupid ideas

21:44.234 --> 21:47.200
you two might have of turning
this into a permanent vacation.

21:47.267 --> 21:50.200
I realize
how this must look right now,

21:50.267 --> 21:52.933
but what you are unaware of
is we're on a mission, okay?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Behind you
at the end of the dining car

21:55.067 --> 21:57.701
are members of the Basque ETA.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.600
Those drunk guys?

22:04.601 --> 22:06.733
Yeah, they-they look
real threatening.

22:12.866 --> 22:14.299
Casey, what are you doing?

22:14.300 --> 22:15.932
You don't understand.
He's getting away!

22:15.933 --> 22:18.701
What kind of a chump do
you take me for anyway?

22:18.766 --> 22:20.866
Sorry.

22:20.933 --> 22:22.533
Come on.
Coming. Coming.

22:22.534 --> 22:23.899
Not so fast.
Wrist. Wrist.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.733
Right.
Okay, go, go, go, go.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Excuse me.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.500
Excuse me. Are you Canadian?

22:38.701 --> 22:40.450
Me, too, eh.

22:40.451 --> 22:42.132
Oh, man.

22:42.133 --> 22:43.566
Sorry to bother you.

22:43.567 --> 22:45.399
Have you seen my friend?
He's about... He's aboot...

22:45.400 --> 22:47.933
Stay away from me,
or I'll cut you.

22:50.733 --> 22:52.800
Not such a passive
people after all, huh?

22:59.367 --> 23:01.267
I'll go first. Oh, you
know, maybe I should...

23:03.567 --> 23:05.933
S- Sarah! I'm stuck!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.765
Sarah? Sarah?
Are you okay?

23:07.766 --> 23:09.967
Hold on, Chuck.
I've got it.

23:13.766 --> 23:17.367
Uh, I just got
locked out. That's all.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.166
Hi. Hi there. Hi.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.067
Lovely scarf.

23:30.133 --> 23:32.033
Whoa!

23:33.900 --> 23:35.466
Oh. Chuck, get off me.

23:35.467 --> 23:36.666
Terrorist, huh?

23:36.667 --> 23:38.800
I would have thought
two spies could come up

23:38.866 --> 23:40.366
with a better excuse than that.

23:40.367 --> 23:41.765
Casey, he's-he's here, okay?

23:41.766 --> 23:43.666
He's in the bathroom,
I swear to you.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.967
Hi.

23:53.267 --> 23:55.200
All right, let's say
I believe you now.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.033
Would you explain to me
what the hell is going on?

24:08.500 --> 24:09.832
Hey! Hey!

24:09.833 --> 24:12.334
Go. Go!

24:17.833 --> 24:20.033
Run! Run! Get
out of the way!

24:20.100 --> 24:22.334
Oh!

24:23.634 --> 24:25.533
That was awesome!

24:25.534 --> 24:27.299
Did you see that hit? Guys!

24:27.300 --> 24:29.200
Oh. Oh.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.600
If you're going
to kill me, just do it.

24:32.601 --> 24:33.633
We're not going to kill you.

24:33.634 --> 24:35.634
Yeah, we're CIA, dirtbag.

24:35.701 --> 24:37.733
Morgan, probably
not the best idea

24:37.800 --> 24:39.533
to share that information
with just anyone.

24:39.534 --> 24:41.900
If you're CIA,
then why did you take out

24:41.967 --> 24:43.867
the Interpol agents
on the train?

24:45.033 --> 24:46.633
Wait. What? Excuse me?

24:46.634 --> 24:47.765
Those weren't your men?

24:47.766 --> 24:49.233
Interpol already
apprehended you?

24:49.234 --> 24:52.067
No, Interpol was taking me
to a witness protection program

24:52.133 --> 24:54.766
in exchange for the names
of several key

24:54.833 --> 24:56.032
ETA leaders.

24:56.033 --> 24:57.399
You turned yourself in?

24:57.400 --> 24:59.166
I have been living on the run

24:59.167 --> 25:01.100
for the last two years
of my life.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.466
I couldn't take it anymore.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.032
You didn't

25:04.033 --> 25:05.366
run this mission
through Beckman?

25:05.367 --> 25:07.334
We wanted to do it,

25:07.400 --> 25:09.967
um, under the radar.

25:10.033 --> 25:11.032
Why?

25:11.033 --> 25:12.233
Because they're quitting.

25:12.234 --> 25:13.233
What?!

25:13.234 --> 25:14.666
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.833
Hold on a second, Chuck.
You can't just stop.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.466
Dude, you are a spy.

25:18.467 --> 25:19.700
This is who you are, man.

25:19.701 --> 25:21.132
You're in the middle
of a mission.

25:21.133 --> 25:22.299
Morgan, Sarah and I...

25:22.300 --> 25:24.099
We decided we want
to be together.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.700
So, this is it for us, okay?

25:25.701 --> 25:28.467
Soon as we hand over Arnaldo,
we're quitting.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.234
Hey, give me the cuffs.

25:40.866 --> 25:42.199
It's Elia.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.400
The Interpol agents
are neutralized.

25:44.467 --> 25:47.067
Someone did our b for us.

25:47.133 --> 25:49.133
Meet me in Pundtun.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.167
We'll make sure Arnaldo
and his new friends never talk.

26:01.134 --> 26:02.999
Chuck, what were you thinking?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.499
You apprehended
Juan Diego Arnaldo

26:04.500 --> 26:06.265
without contacting me first?

26:06.266 --> 26:07.766
Well, yes, technically...

26:07.767 --> 26:10.266
Your part in this little
impromptu mission is over.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.166
I'll arrange for Arnaldo
to be picked up

26:12.167 --> 26:13.833
by a different Interpol team.

26:13.834 --> 26:16.201
Try not to physically
assault them.

26:16.266 --> 26:17.966
General, just so you know,
we didn't hit them

26:17.967 --> 26:19.766
or assault them in any way.

26:19.767 --> 26:21.332
There was no physical
altercation.

26:21.333 --> 26:23.867
We just dosed them with
pharmaceutical-grade narcotics.

26:23.934 --> 26:25.332
Agent Bartowski...

26:25.333 --> 26:26.532
No, you're right.
That's not making it better.

26:26.533 --> 26:28.299
How's she taking it?
Really good I think.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.533
All you need to do Yeah.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.266
is keep Arnaldo alive
until the local team arrives.

26:33.333 --> 26:34.532
Think you can handle that?

26:34.533 --> 26:36.365
Once Arnaldo is placed
Absolutely, General.

26:36.366 --> 26:37.699
Safely in Interpol custody,

26:37.700 --> 26:40.233
you are to return
to Burbank immediately.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.101
And you better have
a good explanation for...

26:45.201 --> 26:48.632
Agent Bartowski?

26:48.633 --> 26:50.066
General, General, please know
I'm not hanging up

26:50.067 --> 26:52.233
on you right now, it's...

26:54.700 --> 26:55.699
Well?

26:55.700 --> 26:58.400
Well, we get to hang around here

26:58.467 --> 27:01.134
for a little bit longer,
so... vaca.

27:01.201 --> 27:02.799
<i>It's like the butter</i>

27:02.800 --> 27:04.700
<i>shot directly from a Swiss cow
into my mouth.</i>

27:04.734 --> 27:07.934
And yet...
still can't enjoy it.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.167
I can't believe you're
just quitting.

27:10.233 --> 27:11.899
Walking away from
everything. I'm not.

27:11.900 --> 27:15.067
I'm walking toward something.
I can't believe you were just

27:15.134 --> 27:16.833
going to leave without saying
good-bye to Ellie, though.

27:16.834 --> 27:18.666
Ellie is going away

27:18.667 --> 27:21.034
to do something
that she wants to do

27:21.101 --> 27:22.599
and I'm happy
for her and Devon.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.067
So that's it?

27:25.134 --> 27:26.632
You're throwing away
your life for Bartowski?

27:26.633 --> 27:28.532
I'm making a life.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.667
You know I've been
tasked to retrieve you.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.066
Yeah, I know why
you're here, Casey,

27:32.067 --> 27:34.000
and we're not going back.

27:34.067 --> 27:35.133
But you're a spy, man.

27:35.134 --> 27:36.299
I mean, this is
the coolest thing

27:36.300 --> 27:37.566
that's ever happened to us.

27:37.567 --> 27:39.967
I know what it means
to make a choice like this.

27:41.633 --> 27:43.033
I won't stop you.

27:43.034 --> 27:44.934
Thank you.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.866
Unless you want me to.

27:46.867 --> 27:48.599
I thought this was everything
that you ever wanted.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.432
It is.

27:50.433 --> 27:51.432
Okay? It is.

27:51.433 --> 27:52.899
But I want Sarah more.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.333
Look, no matter how much I want
to be a spy, I want Chuck more.

27:59.034 --> 28:00.100
May I interject?

28:00.101 --> 28:00.933
No.
No.

28:00.934 --> 28:01.999
<i>So I- if I</i>

28:02.000 --> 28:03.299
<i>have to choose between the two,</i>

28:03.300 --> 28:04.365
I- I choose Sarah.

28:04.366 --> 28:05.733
Does it have to be a choice?

28:05.734 --> 28:07.499
I don't know.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.666
Excuse me.

28:08.667 --> 28:11.101
Look, Sarah has been a spy
her entire life.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.632
And now she's
willing to give up

28:12.633 --> 28:13.899
everything that
she has ever known

28:13.900 --> 28:15.365
to be with me, man. Me.

28:15.366 --> 28:16.799
Doesn't have to be
all or nothing.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.033
No, I can't risk it.

28:18.034 --> 28:19.265
This is what he wants.

28:19.266 --> 28:21.767
And if this is
what she wants...

28:21.834 --> 28:24.467
Then I'm not gonna
risk losing her again.

28:24.533 --> 28:26.633
Okay. Fine.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.166
Just do me this favor.

28:28.167 --> 28:29.265
Before you quit,

28:29.266 --> 28:32.533
make damn sure that quitting
is what she wants.

28:36.201 --> 28:38.201
All right, enough of this.

28:40.201 --> 28:42.101
Well, if you two are
gonna go, you better

28:42.134 --> 28:44.233
go now before the other
Interpol team gets here.

28:45.067 --> 28:46.033
Right now?

28:46.034 --> 28:47.599
Now.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.500
We'll hand over Arnaldo.
We'll handle it.

28:49.934 --> 28:51.834
Well, I will.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.466
Perhaps we should all share

28:53.467 --> 28:54.966
some nut cake before you go.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.666
Especially you two.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.600
Open communication
is very important...

28:58.667 --> 29:00.767
Shut up.

29:00.834 --> 29:02.733
All right.

29:02.734 --> 29:03.766
Say good-bye, huh?

29:03.767 --> 29:04.799
Love you, buddy.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.966
I love you, too.
I'll miss you.

29:05.967 --> 29:07.934
Thank you, Casey.

29:09.101 --> 29:11.600
Hey. Take care
of my boy.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.700
I will.
All right.

29:14.567 --> 29:17.034
Move.

29:31.633 --> 29:35.633
* So kiss me and smile for me *

29:35.700 --> 29:40.667
* Tell me
that you'll wait for me *

29:40.734 --> 29:46.667
* Hold me like
you'll never let me go *

29:48.533 --> 29:53.300
* 'Cause I'm leaving
on a jet plane *

29:53.366 --> 29:54.999
Well, here we go.
* Don't know *

29:55.000 --> 29:57.533
* When I'll be back again *

29:57.600 --> 30:00.034
* Ooh *

30:00.101 --> 30:01.766
I got to say,
it's really weird leaving.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.332
I mean, I've never
lived anywhere

30:03.333 --> 30:05.800
outside of California
before, so...

30:05.867 --> 30:07.133
Well,

30:07.134 --> 30:10.667
I've lived all over
the world, but, um,

30:10.734 --> 30:13.266
well, Burbank's the only place
that ever felt like home.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.067
* Oh, babe, I hate to go *

30:21.633 --> 30:23.934
* I hate to go. *

30:34.934 --> 30:35.999
Good job. All right!

30:36.000 --> 30:37.999
Thank you.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.100
Devon, Ellie, you want to

30:39.101 --> 30:41.667
come up here and
say a few words? Oh.

30:47.533 --> 30:48.833
Colonel John Casey.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.632
Agent Simon.
Agent Patine.

30:50.633 --> 30:52.567
We heard there was a
misunderstanding on the train.

30:52.633 --> 30:53.699
Yeah, you could say that.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.133
Hello.
I'm right here.

30:55.134 --> 30:56.799
So impolite.
M. Grimes.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.000
Can't disclose what the M stands
for. Security. You understand.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.467
So, yeah, yeah. Where you
boys stationed nowadays?

31:01.533 --> 31:02.532
Lake Como.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.532
Is that right? Seriously?

31:03.533 --> 31:05.734
Lake Como?
Oh, I love Lake Como.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.265
I've never actually
been there myself,

31:07.266 --> 31:09.900
but I took an entire plane ride
and read all about it.

31:09.967 --> 31:11.332
Check it out, right here.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.900
Yeah, paints quite
the elegant portrait, you know?

31:13.967 --> 31:16.067
But it is still
just a book, so...

31:16.134 --> 31:18.667
Tell me-
the Villa del Balbianello-

31:18.734 --> 31:21.000
I mean, am I saying that right?
Bell-bell- bellelo?

31:21.067 --> 31:22.365
It's beautiful.
Ah, I can imagine.

31:22.366 --> 31:24.100
This time of year, I would...
Grimes!

31:24.101 --> 31:25.365
Let them do their job.

31:25.366 --> 31:26.332
Naturally. Sure, sure.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.432
There I go.

31:27.433 --> 31:28.599
But one more question
about Lake Como.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.700
Sagra di San Giovanni-

31:30.767 --> 31:32.432
is it just everything
I heard it was?

31:32.433 --> 31:33.699
I mean, I-I...

31:33.700 --> 31:35.532
Look, like I said,
the palaces are beautiful there.

31:35.533 --> 31:37.332
Yeah.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.566
Palaces?

31:38.567 --> 31:40.166
We really should go.

31:40.167 --> 31:42.033
Yeah, no.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.332
I've held you up enough.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.100
I'll just go on all day-
"Lake Como, Lake Como."

31:45.101 --> 31:46.666
But one thing.
Sagra di San Giovanni,

31:46.667 --> 31:48.265
well, it's this
annual festival of boats.

31:48.266 --> 31:49.265
Supposed to be amazing.

31:49.266 --> 31:50.466
Dating back hundreds, if not

31:50.467 --> 31:52.367
thousands of years.
So I don't know,

31:52.400 --> 31:54.200
I just thought anyone
who spent any amount of time

31:54.201 --> 31:56.101
in Lake Como, well,
they'd probably know it.

32:00.567 --> 32:01.699
I don't recommend that.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.299
Oh, Canada.

32:03.300 --> 32:05.200
Wouldn't want to make a scene.

32:05.233 --> 32:07.133
Or a mess.

32:12.734 --> 32:16.366
Well, after you, Agent Walker.

32:16.433 --> 32:18.333
No longer an agent, right?

32:20.600 --> 32:23.433
No longer Mr. Charles
either, I suppose.

32:32.967 --> 32:36.700
Sarah, this is what you
want, right? To run away?

32:39.467 --> 32:42.400
Well, I always thought it had
to be one way or the other,

32:42.467 --> 32:45.734
but maybe...

32:45.800 --> 32:47.432
Maybe-maybe what?

32:47.433 --> 32:48.999
You can say it.
It's okay.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.400
Sorry to cut
the honeymoon short.

32:53.134 --> 32:55.967
But what the hell have you done
with Juan Diego Arnaldo?

33:01.133 --> 33:03.933
Guys, guys, guys,
please listen to me.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.366
This is a giant
misunderstanding.

33:05.367 --> 33:06.566
We're on the same side.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.266
Enough.
You drugged us.

33:08.267 --> 33:11.000
Interpol did send an additional
team to retrieve Arnaldo.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.067
Oh, okay, well, then
I expect an apology.

33:13.133 --> 33:15.234
They were just found dead
ten minutes outside of Pundtun.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.966
Oh, my God, Morgan and Casey.

33:16.967 --> 33:19.667
Guys, our friends are in really
big trouble right now.

33:19.733 --> 33:20.865
Well, our friends are dead.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.466
And you're going
to tell us why.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.367
Call it in.

33:26.133 --> 33:27.566
Sarah, we can't
just leave them.

33:27.567 --> 33:28.932
I know, but if we're going
to do something,

33:28.933 --> 33:29.999
we have to do it right now.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.900
Quiet.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.500
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the cuff keys.

33:40.567 --> 33:41.999
No, we don't have time.

33:42.000 --> 33:42.999
We have to run.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.967
Hold on.

33:52.833 --> 33:56.400
I want to know everything
you've told Interpol.

33:59.833 --> 34:02.634
You should never have
abandoned your team.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.799
Don't you have some sort
of signal you can send

34:05.800 --> 34:07.666
to the CIA to alert them
that we're in danger?

34:07.667 --> 34:11.234
The only CIA agents within
100 miles of here just quit.

34:33.333 --> 34:35.234
Just stay calm.

34:50.567 --> 34:52.467
* *

35:11.967 --> 35:14.033
* *

35:23.300 --> 35:25.200
I can't hit a girl.

35:25.766 --> 35:27.666
I can.

35:29.367 --> 35:31.400
On your feet. Hook arms.
Push, push, push.

35:44.467 --> 35:46.534
That was awesome.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.334
Casey, you all right?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.900
Don't worry, I'll take care
of this one.

35:53.935 --> 35:55.835
Don't you two have
a train to catch?

35:56.967 --> 35:59.601
Uh, yeah. Yeah, we do,
right, Chuck?

35:59.667 --> 36:03.266
Right.

36:03.267 --> 36:05.534
May I just say...

36:06.800 --> 36:08.633
...I've been on the run
for two years,

36:08.634 --> 36:10.299
and no matter how far you run,

36:10.300 --> 36:12.267
you can never run
from yourself.

36:12.334 --> 36:14.400
And from what I've heard
from both of you,

36:14.467 --> 36:17.701
it's not what either
of you really wants.

36:19.667 --> 36:22.000
You don't want to quit?

36:22.067 --> 36:24.434
I thought that's
what you wanted.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.266
I don't want you to choose me

36:26.267 --> 36:27.966
over sometng that you
want for yourself.

36:27.967 --> 36:31.933
I want you. I want us.

36:35.167 --> 36:36.899
Do you think if we went back,

36:36.900 --> 36:39.567
and we told Beckman the
honest-to-god absolute truth,

36:39.634 --> 36:42.866
do you think we'd really
have a shot at having it all?

36:45.701 --> 36:47.166
Chuck Bartowski, do you agree

36:47.167 --> 36:49.267
to not quit the spy life
and be with me?

36:49.334 --> 36:50.333
I do.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.366
Sarah Walker, do you agree

36:51.367 --> 36:53.267
to not quit the spy life
and be with me?

36:53.334 --> 36:55.467
I do.

37:08.666 --> 37:10.233
Good work, Colonel Casey.

37:10.234 --> 37:12.434
Because of your efforts,
a group of Basque terrorists

37:12.501 --> 37:14.900
were captured.
Thank you, General.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.233
It wasn't just me.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.566
Grimes here

37:17.567 --> 37:20.766
was resourceful and quick
to action when necessary.

37:20.833 --> 37:24.666
An unlikely pair often produces
successful results.

37:24.733 --> 37:26.633
Thank you.
You're both dismissed.

37:26.700 --> 37:30.234
Actually, if I may address
you directly, General.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.399
Wow, what a trip.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.334
And Chuck and Sarah,
I know, I know,

37:36.400 --> 37:39.666
they may have acted
impulsively, recklessly,

37:39.733 --> 37:41.833
foolishly even, I don't know,

37:41.900 --> 37:46.800
but I do know this- these two
were born to be spies- together.

37:46.867 --> 37:47.932
Get him out of here.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.833
Ma'am.
What?

37:51.300 --> 37:54.733
Do either of you have
any type of explanation

37:54.800 --> 37:57.134
for your extemporaneous holiday?

37:57.200 --> 37:59.234
It was my fault.
It was my fault.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.467
I flashed and made Agent Walker
accompany me

38:01.534 --> 38:02.899
while pursuing a suspect.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.900
I was following a hunch

38:04.967 --> 38:06.732
and Chuck was simply being
a good partner.

38:06.733 --> 38:08.066
Do you both think me an idiot?

38:08.067 --> 38:09.266
No, ma'am.
No, ma'am.

38:09.267 --> 38:11.234
Then don't lie to me.

38:11.300 --> 38:14.234
General,

38:14.300 --> 38:17.367
look, I think it's
important you should know

38:17.434 --> 38:18.765
that Sarah and I, we, we are...

38:18.766 --> 38:20.632
Stop right there.
Release Agent Walker.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.534
I didn't ask. I don't need
to know all the de...

38:23.601 --> 38:25.466
But I thought you said
no more lies,

38:25.467 --> 38:28.067
and-and we... we want
to tell you the truth.

38:28.134 --> 38:29.133
No.

38:29.134 --> 38:31.034
General, Chuck and I are dating.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.601
Exclusively.

38:39.967 --> 38:44.234
I must caution you that allowing
your private life

38:44.300 --> 38:47.000
to interfere
with your professional one

38:47.067 --> 38:49.334
can be dangerous.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.765
But off the record,

38:50.766 --> 38:52.800
it's about damn time.

39:02.733 --> 39:06.967
Oh, my God,
I forgot that Ellie was leaving.

39:15.933 --> 39:18.200
Ellie, Devon?

39:32.534 --> 39:35.300
I've never asked
Chuck for anything.

39:35.367 --> 39:39.434
I just wanted the chance
to say good-bye.

39:39.501 --> 39:41.633
And he couldn't even
give me that.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.200
I just wanted the chance
to say good-bye.

39:48.267 --> 39:50.534
And he couldn't...
Chuck.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.399
Ellie.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.467
I forgot my phone.

39:56.534 --> 39:58.900
I think I still might be
a little drunk.

39:58.967 --> 40:00.099
I'm so sorry, Ellie.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.433
I wanted to be here.

40:01.434 --> 40:02.632
Chuck, it's fine.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.733
You missed one party.

40:05.800 --> 40:12.434
Truth is, I think I got so drunk
because I was upset with myself.

40:12.501 --> 40:15.167
I'm leaving my little brother.

40:15.234 --> 40:18.300
I'm not so little anymore.

40:27.167 --> 40:30.766
And, uh, just so you know,

40:30.833 --> 40:34.833
you're not leaving me alone.

40:38.467 --> 40:40.032
You guys are back together?

40:40.033 --> 40:42.601
We're together.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.033
I think I found the one.

40:51.067 --> 40:52.967
This is going to be
your favorite song.

41:05.167 --> 41:08.567
I like this.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.900
That's a good start.
