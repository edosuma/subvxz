WEBVTT

00:08.848 --> 00:13.558
He calls himself a quarterback? I've
passed kidney stones more accurately.

00:14.691 --> 00:18.889
Roz, could you get my briefcase?
I left it in the studio.

00:19.239 --> 00:21.434
Why don't you go get it?

00:21.702 --> 00:23.658
He always humiliates me on the air.

00:23.914 --> 00:26.144
What do you think he does to me?

00:26.418 --> 00:30.889
Last week, he introduced me as
Martina Navratilova's girlfriend.

00:33.513 --> 00:36.107
Chuck, I'm sorry I offended you.

00:36.393 --> 00:40.386
Now, why don't you put your skirt
back on and do some dishes?

00:40.733 --> 00:43.452
The lines are open.

00:44.990 --> 00:48.869
How about some real men calling in
instead of crybabies like Chuck?

00:51.250 --> 00:54.606
Ah! Look who just crawled in:
Dr Frasier Crane.

00:54.924 --> 00:58.121
And you know what we do when
we get a house call from the doctor.

00:58.429 --> 01:02.468
(Italian accent) 'Drop your pants,
bend over. I take your temperature.'

01:03.897 --> 01:06.206
Hello, Bulldog.

01:06.484 --> 01:09.317
Who's your pick for
the Giants/Saints game this weekend?

01:09.614 --> 01:11.764
- The Giants.
- No.

01:12.035 --> 01:14.185
- The Saints.
- No.

01:14.455 --> 01:18.767
- Somebody has to win.
- If they were playing this weekend!

01:19.130 --> 01:21.644
(Donkey brays)

01:21.926 --> 01:24.679
Very funny.
You should play it on my show.

01:24.973 --> 01:28.886
It deserves to be heard by
a larger audience. Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

01:33.487 --> 01:36.047
(Doorbell)

01:37.243 --> 01:39.393
Hello, Dr Crane.

01:39.664 --> 01:43.657
- I brought this for dinner.
- Hey, Niles. You're early.

01:44.005 --> 01:48.476
I put Maris on the train to Chicago.
I am desolate without her.

01:48.846 --> 01:50.837
Champagne?

01:51.851 --> 01:53.842
It goes with all occasions.

01:54.104 --> 01:57.414
- Can I assist you in the kitchen?
- No, I have everything well in hand.

01:57.735 --> 01:59.930
Ah, well, lucky everything.

02:05.372 --> 02:07.488
Mmm... Uh-uh...

02:10.507 --> 02:11.906
Uh-uh...

02:12.134 --> 02:16.764
- What would you do?
- Take that corn nut off the board.

02:17.142 --> 02:20.691
That's my bishop.
Eddie ate the real one.

02:21.024 --> 02:23.697
In that case, corn nut to rook 7.

02:23.987 --> 02:25.864
Hello, all.

02:26.116 --> 02:29.347
Evening.
Your brother brought champagne!

02:29.663 --> 02:32.860
Oh, Maris left for Chicago already?

02:35.005 --> 02:37.439
She's riding the rails as we speak.

02:37.717 --> 02:39.992
Why doesn't she fly instead?

02:40.264 --> 02:43.973
She's been afraid to fly
since her harrowing incident.

02:44.312 --> 02:46.223
Did her plane almost crash?

02:46.482 --> 02:49.042
No, she was bumped from first class.

02:50.698 --> 02:52.654
She still wakes up screaming.

02:52.909 --> 02:56.458
- Frasier, I got a favour to ask you.
- What is it?

02:56.791 --> 03:00.909
A buddy of mine is running
the Widows and Orphans Fund benefit,

03:01.257 --> 03:05.091
and he needs some local
celebrities for his bachelor auction.

03:05.430 --> 03:09.264
If we could get somebody
really famous from the radio station...

03:09.604 --> 03:13.040
- I'd be delighted to help.
- So you'll ask Bulldog?

03:16.282 --> 03:19.240
- Bulldog?
- Oh, well, you know...

03:19.537 --> 03:21.892
I... Well, I mean...

03:22.166 --> 03:25.795
Don't get me wrong,
I was going to ask you, too.

03:26.131 --> 03:29.362
- I was just saving the best for last.
- Uh-huh.

03:29.678 --> 03:33.557
If he back-pedals any faster,
he'll trip over his walker.

03:36.064 --> 03:38.100
All right, I'll do it.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.396
I really appreciate it.

03:40.655 --> 03:44.807
- You won't forget to ask Bulldog?
- I'll leave a note on his hydrant.

03:46.873 --> 03:50.502
Oh, a bachelor auction.
It'd be fun to pick a man off the block

03:50.839 --> 03:53.751
to do my bidding
and fulfil my every desire.

03:54.052 --> 03:57.169
- Doctor Crane?
- I'd love to. I mean... I...

03:58.643 --> 04:00.042
Uh... Frasier?

04:01.064 --> 04:03.658
What if no one bids?

04:03.943 --> 04:07.902
What if you're left standing there
with flop sweat trickling down your back

04:08.242 --> 04:11.120
amidst a great gaping silence?

04:11.414 --> 04:14.167
- It'll never happen.
- Thank you, Dad.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.338
Yeah, we got a band.

04:21.096 --> 04:24.055
(Auctioneer) Our next
bachelor on the block is public TV's

04:24.352 --> 04:27.344
own cute and cuddly Mr Science!

04:27.649 --> 04:30.288
(Women cheer and yell)

04:30.571 --> 04:34.325
God, the oestrogen level
is off the charts out there.

04:34.660 --> 04:36.696
Yeah, isn't it great!

04:36.956 --> 04:40.266
Deep down, chicks are just like guys -
we all want the same thing.

04:40.587 --> 04:43.055
Frasier Crane does not put out.

04:43.342 --> 04:45.810
All they're getting is a gourmet meal

04:46.096 --> 04:49.247
- and a handshake at the door.
- Boring!

04:49.560 --> 04:53.712
My date gets a stretch limo, dinner,
floor seats at the Sonics game,

04:54.068 --> 04:58.539
and these incredible buns of steel.
Feel them, Doc. C'mon, feel them!

04:58.909 --> 05:00.706
Thank you, no.

05:00.954 --> 05:03.149
(Women shout)

05:03.416 --> 05:07.329
Ladies, keep your
articles of clothing off the stage.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.633
Show these women celebrity beefcake
and they go nutso!

05:11.973 --> 05:17.411
Typical mob mentality. I hope
the fire exits are clearly marked.

05:17.815 --> 05:20.488
Relax, will you?

05:20.778 --> 05:24.691
You're not the one jumping into the
Rottweiler pit carrying a pork chop.

05:25.035 --> 05:29.426
Hey, That's T.J. Smith
he's a linebacker for the Seahawks!

05:29.793 --> 05:33.832
They call him "The Enforcer".
He's put two quarterbacks in hospital.

05:34.175 --> 05:36.484
T.J., Marty Crane!

05:36.763 --> 05:40.642
- Number 19?
- Please don't make me go out there.

05:40.978 --> 05:45.290
Oh... You'll be fine. Just go on out there
and have a good time.

05:45.653 --> 05:47.803
(Women scream and yell)

05:49.534 --> 05:51.490
They're gonna have him for breakfast.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.929
(Door opens. Women scream and yell)

05:58.215 --> 05:59.967
How was it?

06:00.218 --> 06:03.096
They're like sharks in a feeding frenzy.

06:03.390 --> 06:05.506
The one who bought me looked crazed.

06:05.770 --> 06:07.886
Where do I pay?

06:08.148 --> 06:11.458
- Roz!
- I saw what I wanted and I went after it.

06:12.781 --> 06:14.533
Stay!

06:16.161 --> 06:17.913
Number 20?

06:18.207 --> 06:22.883
- That's me.
- I really appreciate this.

06:23.257 --> 06:26.454
Having somebody like you
in the auction really adds class.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.834
If the bidding gets slow,

06:30.142 --> 06:34.215
drop a quarter and take
a couple of minutes to pick it up, huh?

06:38.365 --> 06:42.483
(Auctioneer) Sold! To that determined
lady in the back row for $500!

06:42.831 --> 06:45.220
(Women cheer)

06:45.501 --> 06:48.937
- So, Doc, who bought you?
- No idea.

06:49.258 --> 06:51.692
The last thing I remember
is someone shouting out:

06:51.971 --> 06:54.280
"Shake your money maker!"

06:57.104 --> 07:00.574
- Number 21.
- Ladies, start your engines!

07:00.901 --> 07:03.859
(Women cheer)

07:05.326 --> 07:07.317
Doctor Crane?

07:07.580 --> 07:10.731
Kristina Harper. I just bought you.

07:14.925 --> 07:17.359
You... bought me?

07:17.638 --> 07:21.028
Yeah. I listen to your show.
I'm a big fan of yours.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.947
Well, how... wonderful.

07:27.028 --> 07:30.577
You bought me for $500.
That's a lot of money.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.424
I did a layout for "Seattle Style".

07:33.706 --> 07:36.539
- Are you a photographer?
- No, I'm a model.

07:36.836 --> 07:39.953
A model! How wonderful!
For you...

07:40.258 --> 07:42.374
How about Friday?

07:42.638 --> 07:46.517
OK. I live at the Elliot Bay Towers.
Around seven?

07:46.852 --> 07:50.447
- Sounds great. See you then.
- Bye.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.392
That's my new owner.

08:02.128 --> 08:04.119
She's a model.

08:04.382 --> 08:06.942
No kidding.
She almost put my eye out.

08:08.013 --> 08:10.083
You're back quick.

08:10.350 --> 08:13.786
I was one of the last guys.
The money was running low.

08:14.106 --> 08:18.179
But there was still one rawhide
chew-toy out there for the Bulldog.

08:22.578 --> 08:26.332
I got to take a squirt.
When I come back, we'll play fetch.

08:26.668 --> 08:28.784
My God! Daphne, why?

08:29.048 --> 08:32.357
Things were slow,
so your father asked me to shill.

08:32.678 --> 08:36.511
I opened at $100.
Who knew that would be the only bid?

08:43.236 --> 08:45.193
(Doorbell)

08:46.201 --> 08:48.157
Whoosh!

08:50.000 --> 08:56.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

09:09.155 --> 09:11.874
Kristina. <i>Buonanotte.</i>

09:12.160 --> 09:14.549
Sorry I'm late but I got a call for a job.

09:14.831 --> 09:17.220
OK. You're here now.

09:17.502 --> 09:21.097
No, the job's tonight,
but we could have dinner later.

09:21.426 --> 09:23.496
All right.

09:23.762 --> 09:26.071
I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble.

09:26.350 --> 09:28.341
Oh, no!

09:29.772 --> 09:33.811
- You rented a restaurant trolley.
- No, I own it. You don't have one?

09:35.157 --> 09:39.708
One more thing. My friend Sandy
got called in on the same job

09:40.081 --> 09:43.960
and she was supposed
to look after my daughter.

09:47.844 --> 09:51.393
Don't tell me you want me to baby-sit.

09:51.725 --> 09:55.798
Sandy will take her when I get back
and that'll leave just the two of us.

09:56.149 --> 09:58.299
Kristina,
I'm not really sure if I can...

09:59.906 --> 10:03.103
- I'll make points for this, won't l?
- A ton.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.517
Bring the darling in.

10:10.590 --> 10:13.787
- This is my daughter Renata.
- Hello.

10:14.096 --> 10:16.052
She's shy at first.

10:16.307 --> 10:17.262
(Bell)

10:17.476 --> 10:20.468
Oh, there's the elevator.
See you later.

10:24.028 --> 10:27.304
Well, come on in. Have a seat.

10:29.371 --> 10:32.124
Can I get you, uh... a soft drink?

10:34.629 --> 10:36.620
Goose liver pâté?

10:38.469 --> 10:42.018
"Renata" that's a pretty name.
It must have...

10:42.350 --> 10:44.739
Can I use your phone?

10:45.021 --> 10:48.730
We're spending the evening together.
Let's make the best of it.

10:49.070 --> 10:53.268
I may surprise you. I probably am
more "with it" than you think I am.

10:54.829 --> 10:57.787
The phone's right there.

11:00.755 --> 11:04.714
No way! No way!

11:05.054 --> 11:07.648
That is so fresh.

11:09.395 --> 11:11.226
No way!

11:12.650 --> 11:14.402
No way!

11:16.156 --> 11:17.589
No...

11:17.825 --> 11:19.258
...way!

11:22.666 --> 11:26.181
Hold on, there's another call.
Hello?

11:26.507 --> 11:29.101
(Irritated) He'll call you back.

11:31.139 --> 11:33.095
- No way!
- Who was that?

11:33.351 --> 11:35.819
I don't know.
No way!

11:36.105 --> 11:40.621
- Another call's coming in.
- I'll take this one. Hello?

11:42.032 --> 11:44.148
It's for you.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.434
Hello? Hey, Tiffany.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.983
Tiffany! You just spoke to Tiffany!

11:50.254 --> 11:53.690
That was Tiffany Schwartz.
This is Tiffany Martinez.

11:55.304 --> 11:59.695
I celebrate the ethnic mosaic
that is America, but nonetheless...

12:00.062 --> 12:02.098
What's your damage?

12:02.357 --> 12:04.746
You've been on the phone
for 1½ hours.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.781
You haven't spoken to me
except to ask for more Cheetos!

12:08.075 --> 12:11.112
They're coming, Eddie!

12:14.419 --> 12:17.456
I'm supposed to be happy I'm here?

12:17.757 --> 12:19.713
Her fabulousness dumps me here

12:19.970 --> 12:22.040
with a total stranger
who could be a perv.

12:22.307 --> 12:27.779
I'm not thrilled about it either.
And I am not a perv.

12:28.192 --> 12:32.708
You don't get it.
She's always doing this. She's a flake.

12:33.074 --> 12:38.785
Flake or not, you are in my charge.
You should have something nutritious.

12:39.210 --> 12:41.770
Now, how about seafood crêpes?

12:42.048 --> 12:44.118
Lobster Newburg?

12:44.385 --> 12:46.660
Corndog dipped in curare?

12:49.185 --> 12:53.576
- Have you got any raw cookie dough?
- Even more lethal. Let's see.

12:53.943 --> 12:59.176
You wouldn't have gotten anywhere
with this gourmet meal routine.

12:59.576 --> 13:02.648
She eats nothing.
She's a total diet freak.

13:02.958 --> 13:05.472
And she only talks about herself.

13:05.753 --> 13:09.302
- You don't care much for your mother?
- Well, duh (!)

13:09.635 --> 13:13.947
I hate to think that when my son's
your age, he'll think of me as a...

13:14.309 --> 13:17.062
- Dweeb?
- Thank you.

13:17.356 --> 13:19.916
Brace yourself.

13:21.864 --> 13:25.413
Oh, well, look what we have here.
Will one tube suffice?

13:25.744 --> 13:30.340
- Cool.
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

13:34.217 --> 13:38.688
Renata, you know...I am a psychiatrist.

13:39.058 --> 13:43.574
And if you're having problems
with your mother, I'd be glad to listen.

13:43.941 --> 13:48.173
You want me to tell you my problems
like those gomers on your show?

13:49.826 --> 13:53.819
- Like you care (!)
- I do care about the gomers.

13:55.461 --> 13:58.897
- I even care about you.
- Don't make me hurl.

14:07.940 --> 14:12.934
- She tells people I'm younger.
- Why do you think she does that?

14:13.323 --> 14:15.598
So they won't know how old SHE is.

14:15.869 --> 14:20.545
- I've been nine for three years.
- Really?

14:20.919 --> 14:24.070
Once she promised
to take me ice-skating.

14:24.383 --> 14:26.977
On the way there,
she saw a tattoo parlour.

14:27.263 --> 14:31.222
She left me outside to get
a butterfly tattooed on her shoulder.

14:31.562 --> 14:35.316
- She forgot I was out there.
- How old were you?

14:35.652 --> 14:38.166
That was the FIRST time I was nine.

14:40.827 --> 14:43.216
What does your father say about this?

14:43.498 --> 14:47.457
Tony? He's on the road
with Whitesnake all the time.

14:47.797 --> 14:50.994
- Is that a musical group or a pet?
- It's his new wife.

14:55.602 --> 15:00.198
I was apprehensive
about going out with you tonight,

15:00.568 --> 15:05.403
but I'm having a jolly time unless
it's the champagne getting to me.

15:05.784 --> 15:09.697
I have had quite a bit, haven't l?
Oh, who cares?

15:10.042 --> 15:14.479
That's the beauty of being in a limo
unless the driver's drinking.

15:14.841 --> 15:19.073
You're not drinking, are you?
He's not drinking.

15:19.432 --> 15:21.423
(Klaxon honks)

15:21.686 --> 15:26.885
- Let's drink to the driver not drinking!
- Man, you're really looped... Great!

15:27.278 --> 15:29.917
(Car horn blares)

15:30.200 --> 15:34.876
It certainly is taking a long time
getting out of this parking lot.

15:35.250 --> 15:40.483
Did I say this was my first
basketball game? I did, four times.

15:40.884 --> 15:45.321
I still can't get over those players.
They're positively gigantic.

15:45.684 --> 15:49.962
Not that being tall is the only measure
of a man...but it's a bloody good one!

15:53.781 --> 15:58.172
Oh, dear, I just insulted you,
didn't l? Sorry.

15:58.539 --> 16:02.657
Oh, well, you can take it.
You're a tough little nut.

16:04.047 --> 16:07.357
Oh, dear...
This is not good, not good at all.

16:07.679 --> 16:11.957
- You don't like the champagne?
- No, I can see the bottom of my glass!

16:12.312 --> 16:14.382
Well, bottoms up!

16:14.648 --> 16:19.164
You are a naughty boy.
Don't go getting any ideas.

16:19.531 --> 16:23.570
Oh, look who I'm saying this to.
You don't have an idea in your head.

16:26.585 --> 16:29.782
Oh! I did it again. I insulted you.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.399
Let's drink to that. Boom!

16:34.348 --> 16:36.623
(Car horn blares)

16:36.894 --> 16:38.885
Now, that is downright rude!

16:40.107 --> 16:45.022
Hey, you there! You in the Firebird!
Yes, you, stop that honking!

16:45.407 --> 16:47.762
(Car horn blares)

16:48.037 --> 16:51.586
Just because you look stupid
doesn't mean you have to act stupid!

16:51.918 --> 16:54.716
Don't aggravate him!

16:55.006 --> 16:57.474
Tosh! Civilisation won't progress

16:57.761 --> 17:01.151
unless someone points out
when people's manners are remiss.

17:01.476 --> 17:04.752
- (Man) Move it!
- Oh, shut your bloody cakehole!

17:06.233 --> 17:09.431
Don't do that!
He's getting out of his car now.

17:09.739 --> 17:12.810
- Ooh, he's a tall one, too.
- Roll up your window!

17:13.119 --> 17:15.076
He won't hurt a woman.

17:15.332 --> 17:19.883
- Just roll it up!
- Oh...! Let him go!

17:20.257 --> 17:25.455
- (Shouts) Let him go, you big ugly oaf!
- Shut up!

17:26.892 --> 17:29.804
(Thumping)

17:30.106 --> 17:32.904
Oh... Well, we're moving.

17:34.905 --> 17:38.659
Thank you, <i>Pit Bull!</i>
I had a lovely time!

17:51.224 --> 17:54.534
You know,
this cookie dough is not that bad.

17:56.441 --> 18:00.070
Of course, I'm sure later
I'll be <i>hurling,</i> but, well...

18:00.406 --> 18:02.397
(Doorbell)

18:02.659 --> 18:06.538
- Her fabulousness. Want that dough?
- I'd better not.

18:06.875 --> 18:11.426
If I gain an ounce, she goes ballistic.
She makes me weigh in every morning.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.759
- You poor thing.
- I'm used to it.

18:17.518 --> 18:19.827
Hi, I'm back.

18:20.106 --> 18:24.384
Renata, honey... Sandy's
waiting downstairs in the car.

18:26.574 --> 18:30.044
Renata? I must say, I had a rather
enjoyable evening.

18:30.372 --> 18:33.011
You don't get out much, do you?

18:34.087 --> 18:36.043
I think she likes me.

18:36.298 --> 18:40.849
Thank you for helping me out.
Now roll out that trolley. I'm starved.

18:41.223 --> 18:44.340
You know...I don't think so.

18:44.646 --> 18:47.763
Spend the evening
with your daughter.

18:48.068 --> 18:50.741
But I thought we had a date.

18:51.031 --> 18:56.185
When we first met, I was attracted
by your remarkable beauty,

18:56.582 --> 18:59.619
but now that I know
a bit more about you,

18:59.920 --> 19:03.230
suddenly you don't look so good, sister.

19:07.558 --> 19:09.310
Excuse me?

19:09.562 --> 19:13.316
You don't leave your daughter
on some street corner

19:13.651 --> 19:15.881
while you're getting tattooed,

19:16.156 --> 19:20.354
or keep her in some never-never land
where everyone is nine forever!

19:20.705 --> 19:22.457
Renata told you that?

19:22.708 --> 19:26.747
Yes, she also told me about the time
you left her with the coat-check girl.

19:27.091 --> 19:29.764
What kind of mother are you?

19:30.054 --> 19:33.683
Did it occur to you she might be lying?

19:34.019 --> 19:37.409
Cos this is the first night
I've been out in a year.

19:37.733 --> 19:41.692
John and Marianne never take her,
her father and his new wife.

19:42.032 --> 19:45.388
- Who are Tony and Whitesnake?
- Our two dogs.

19:51.172 --> 19:55.324
Most nights, I stay home
and I help her with her homework.

19:55.680 --> 20:00.959
Except last Saturday, when I took
her and her 12 friends ice-skating.

20:01.355 --> 20:05.234
I don't suppose that during that party
you got your shoulder tattooed?

20:06.865 --> 20:09.982
Do you see anything there, hmm?

20:12.541 --> 20:14.372
No.

20:14.627 --> 20:17.937
But then, my eyes are tearing up.

20:22.932 --> 20:26.891
- But why would she lie?
- Because she's 12 and mad at me.

20:27.231 --> 20:29.540
I wouldn't let her stay home alone.

20:29.819 --> 20:33.858
I probably would have been better off
if I had! Some shrink you are (!)

20:34.202 --> 20:38.275
Child development is not my thing.
My specialty is adult relations.

20:38.626 --> 20:41.982
You won't be having
any of those tonight.

20:42.298 --> 20:44.050
Don't go!

20:44.301 --> 20:48.010
Oh, by the way, I only have one
kidney. Guess who has the other?

21:13.140 --> 21:16.769
Is the coast clear?
Where's the supermodel?

21:17.106 --> 21:19.336
She left.

21:19.609 --> 21:22.885
I was afraid I might walk in
on an embarrassing moment.

21:23.199 --> 21:29.354
- You would have, half an hour ago.
- What are you doing still up?

21:29.793 --> 21:35.663
I was just wondering if my sweet boy
is going to be a monster when he's 12.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.370
What the hell brought that up?

21:39.726 --> 21:41.717
It's a long story.
Do you really want to hear it?

21:41.980 --> 21:44.050
Well, it is getting late...

21:45.861 --> 21:50.298
All kids start out cute,
then somewhere along the way,

21:50.660 --> 21:53.379
they get into that know-it-all stage.

21:53.665 --> 21:56.657
- You think they'll never grow out of it.
- Eventually they do.

21:56.962 --> 21:58.953
I'm still hoping.

22:00.677 --> 22:02.747
(Phone)

22:04.058 --> 22:08.051
Hello? Oh, Daphne.
How was your evening?

22:08.398 --> 22:10.593
No way!

22:13.782 --> 22:18.412
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.458 --> 22:20.811
# Oh, my!

22:21.044 --> 22:25.799
# And maybe I seen a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.181 --> 22:33.050
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.108 --> 22:36.542
# They're calling again #

22:36.820 --> 22:39.414
Good night, Seattle, we love you!

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
