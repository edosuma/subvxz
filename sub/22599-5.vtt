18:47.377 --> 18:53.050
Rise, the demon Etrigan

19:21.453 --> 19:23.080
[EXHALES]

19:24.123 --> 19:26.208
Surrender, old man.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.711
Arthur's reign is clone and you with it.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.841
This is the age of Le Fey.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.062
And finally--

19:49.815 --> 19:51.108
You?

19:52.317 --> 19:54.611
I know, I know, I'm amazing, right?

19:54.862 --> 19:57.990
You think your pathetic arrows
can stop me?

19:58.240 --> 20:02.953
Maybe not,
but I'm betting that this will. Uhn! Uhn!

20:03.287 --> 20:07.666
Only the one who is worthy
can release Excalibur from the stone...

20:07.958 --> 20:11.336
...and all you're worthy of
is failure and death.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.841
Maybe the one that was worthy
is really two.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.271
[ROARS]

20:34.401 --> 20:35.819
[SCREECHING]

20:47.998 --> 20:49.374
[MOANS]

20:49.374 --> 20:51.960
Forgive me, archer. I misjudged you.

20:52.211 --> 20:54.338
Eh, you're not the first.

20:55.172 --> 20:56.340
BATMAN:
You're free now, Etrigan.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.091
What will you do?

20:58.342 --> 21:01.428
When will you foolish mortals learn?

21:01.720 --> 21:06.850
A demon's fate's not your concern.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.605
GREEN ARROW:
Oh, he's a charmer, that one.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.780
MERLIN: King Arthur will be most
grateful for all you have done.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.741
I have no doubt
that he will knight you both.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.076
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.203
Why in the world
would Arthur knight him?

21:26.495 --> 21:28.997
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be a statue now.

21:29.248 --> 21:32.501
And if it wasn't for me,
you'd be dragon jerky.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.712
Just can't handle the fact
that I showed you up again, can you?

21:35.963 --> 21:38.715
Dark Knight, archer, please.

21:38.966 --> 21:41.760
- Again?
- As in always.

21:42.052 --> 21:46.056
This conduct is most unbecoming
in candidates for knighthood.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.225
As in, in your dreams.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.060
[SIGHS]

21:56.692 --> 22:01.238
I guess we really do take this
competitive thing way too far, huh?

22:03.282 --> 22:05.867
Since we took Le Fey together,
when you think about it...

22:06.118 --> 22:08.912
-...we're still tied, right?
- Right.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.207
- And what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.918
[BEEPING]

22:15.294 --> 22:16.628
Break-in at Bank of Star City.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.381
Bet this baby can get there
before your bucket of bolts can.

22:20.257 --> 22:23.176
BATMAN:
I know, I know. Totally juvenile.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.469
You're on.
