the one who was fired
in Islamabad

00:48.108 --> 00:49.240
about the same time
you got there.

Jordan Harris.

00:50.577 --> 00:51.943
No, Sandy didn't throw me out,

00:51.945 --> 00:53.277
it was Lockhart.

00:53.279 --> 00:55.246
I flew all the way
back here from Islamabad

00:55.248 --> 00:59.851

asset providing

01:05.025 --> 01:06.624
targeting information
on terrorists.

01:06.626 --> 01:08.526
He was out there trading
top secret information.

01:08.528 --> 01:11.195
- Oh, please.
- To God knows who.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.697
You knew what was
going on there.

01:12.699 --> 01:14.098
That makes you complicit.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.134

- It's called treason.

01:17.203 --> 01:18.369
I want Islamabad.

01:18.371 --> 01:19.771
We had a meltdown over there.

01:19.773 --> 01:21.272
I'm gonna need you
to send some guys over

01:21.274 --> 01:22.540

it doesn't happen again.

01:23.677 --> 01:24.676
They're sending me back.

I don't have a choice.

04:00.262 --> 04:01.728

You were looking to leave
the Agency then as well.

05:34.323 --> 05:35.455
That was different.

05:35.457 --> 05:36.857
How so?

Now I just want out.

As I'm sure you're aware,
it's not as simple as that.

05:48.971 --> 05:52.372
We need to certify that
you're not a danger to yourself.

05:52.374 --> 05:53.840
Or to others.

05:53.842 --> 05:55.675
Among other things.

05:55.677 --> 05:59.346
You're talking about
what happened at the diner.

05:59.348 --> 06:02.682
You fractured
a man's cheekbone.

06:02.684 --> 06:04.484
It says here 63 stitches.

06:05.720 --> 06:09.723
I controlled myself
for 12 fucking years.

06:09.725 --> 06:11.992

Once is all it takes.

06:16.198 --> 06:19.599
It won't happen again.

06:19.601 --> 06:23.503
Last time you were in here,
you talked about nightmares.

06:23.505 --> 06:25.839
Seeing your first kill
over and over again,

06:25.841 --> 06:28.075
his head disappearing
in a puddle of mud.

06:28.077 --> 06:29.209
Look, I snapped.

06:29.211 --> 06:32.279
What more do you
want me to say?

06:36.384 --> 06:40.053
Obviously, we need to talk about
recent events in Islamabad.

06:40.055 --> 06:43.056
Obviously.

06:43.058 --> 06:45.926
What about the two men
you killed on the ground there?

06:45.928 --> 06:47.594
What about them?

06:47.596 --> 06:49.062
Do you think about them?

06:49.064 --> 06:50.697
I do not.

06:50.699 --> 06:54.401
I think about Sandy and Carrie
and the choice I made.

06:54.403 --> 06:56.036
Carrie Mathison?

06:56.038 --> 06:58.271
Yes.

06:58.273 --> 07:00.273
She came up a lot
last time we talked.

07:00.275 --> 07:01.775
I don't remember.

07:01.777 --> 07:03.310
Dr. Byatt: You said she was
one of the reasons

07:03.312 --> 07:04.978
you wanted out of
Dar Adal's group.

07:04.980 --> 07:06.746
Maybe she was.

07:06.748 --> 07:09.449
She didn't approve
of targeted assassinations?

07:09.451 --> 07:12.652
No, I was the one having
the problem, not her.

07:12.654 --> 07:15.122
The Agency is worried
you might want to talk

07:15.124 --> 07:16.490
about all that one day.

07:16.492 --> 07:18.158
Well, you tell them
not to worry--

07:18.160 --> 07:20.260
I know what I agreed to.

07:20.262 --> 07:22.329
And what about Carrie?

07:22.331 --> 07:24.397
What about her?

07:24.399 --> 07:27.400
You just said you had
a choice to make in that car.

07:27.402 --> 07:29.803
You chose her.

07:31.606 --> 07:33.940
Is that a question?

07:33.942 --> 07:35.609
Are the two of you
romantically involved?

Answer.

07:37.813 --> 07:39.513
Please.

I don't see what that has
to do with anything.

much new to report,

catch you up myself.

10:14.169 --> 10:16.503

we stick to my plan?

No one regrets his death,

10:47.502 --> 10:49.969

Dande Darpa Khel, more than me.

10:49.971 --> 10:50.970
Regret it or not,

10:50.972 --> 10:52.605
US-Pakistan relations are

10:52.607 --> 10:55.608
at their lowest point
since the raid on Abbottabad.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.445
And at a time that we can
least afford it.

11:04.619 --> 11:06.119

on such short notice.

11:42.724 --> 11:45.024
Okay, I'll dive right in.

11:45.026 --> 11:48.261
Who can tell me something
about Jordan Harris?

11:52.433 --> 11:54.434
What, no opinions?

11:54.436 --> 11:56.703
Come on, you guys worked
with him for 18 months.

11:56.705 --> 11:59.606
What do you want to know?

12:00.941 --> 12:04.544
Do you share his suspicions
about Sandy Bachman?

12:04.546 --> 12:06.880
What suspicions?

12:06.882 --> 12:09.282
That, in exchange for upper-tier
targeting information,

12:09.284 --> 12:11.584
he was passing secrets
to somebody inside the S-wing

12:11.586 --> 12:12.719
of Pakistani intelligence.

12:12.721 --> 12:14.854
Harris is an asshole.

12:14.856 --> 12:16.956
Yeah, but is he right?

12:16.958 --> 12:20.927
Sandy's intel was
consistently good.

12:20.929 --> 12:23.163
(Sighs)

12:24.732 --> 12:26.699
Maybe it was too good.

12:26.701 --> 12:28.968
I mean, how else was he getting

12:28.970 --> 12:30.770
exact targeting coordinates
on bad guys

12:30.772 --> 12:32.472
we'd lost track of for years?

12:33.941 --> 12:36.142
Look, I get it.

12:36.144 --> 12:38.211
Nobody wants to admit
the possibility he was spying

12:38.213 --> 12:39.245
right under our noses...

12:39.247 --> 12:43.216
Young lady, let's have a chat.

12:43.218 --> 12:45.351
Sit down, John.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.335
I was about to say...

13:04.772 --> 13:06.439
I'm the one to blame.

13:06.441 --> 13:09.843
I wanted to believe
in Sandy more than anyone.

13:09.845 --> 13:13.446
But blame right now
is beside the point.

13:13.448 --> 13:14.848
In light of
what Harris told me,

13:14.850 --> 13:16.783
we have to reconstruct
the events leading

13:16.785 --> 13:18.318
to Sandy's death.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.987
What was he doing
outside the embassy that day?

13:20.989 --> 13:22.655
Who was he meeting with?

13:22.657 --> 13:25.492
And were they really
passing secrets back and forth?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.262
Yes?

13:29.264 --> 13:32.465
None of this is gonna be easy
if we're confined to campus.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.434
What's your name?

13:34.436 --> 13:36.970
Hensleigh. Alan Hensleigh.

13:36.972 --> 13:39.806
Yeah, I'm working on that, Alan.

13:39.808 --> 13:43.042
Expect the lockdown
to be lifted by tomorrow.

13:43.044 --> 13:44.477
And get me the transport log

13:44.479 --> 13:47.413
for the last five days
and a pouch, please.

13:49.116 --> 13:52.185
Okay, John. You and I
are gonna have that chat now.

14:01.395 --> 14:03.129
(Door closes)

14:03.131 --> 14:05.365
You were given a directive
to make yourself useful to me

14:05.367 --> 14:07.233
in any way I request or require.

14:07.235 --> 14:09.402
That doesn't give you
license to breeze in here

14:09.404 --> 14:11.504
and take a dump on my station.

14:11.506 --> 14:13.740
My station.

14:13.742 --> 14:16.175
And either you comply, or I'll
have the Marines remove you

14:16.177 --> 14:18.811
from the embassy and put you
on the next plane home.

14:20.648 --> 14:22.348
How did you swing this?

14:22.350 --> 14:24.150
Swing what?

14:24.152 --> 14:27.086
Four days ago, I got the
call tapping me as chief.

14:27.088 --> 14:29.188
Then yesterday,
Lockhart suddenly

14:29.190 --> 14:32.592
reverses his decision.

14:34.194 --> 14:35.495
What?

14:35.497 --> 14:38.197
That's a perfectly
innocent question.

14:38.199 --> 14:41.501
You really want
to know how I did it?

14:43.170 --> 14:45.338
I asked nicely.

14:50.911 --> 14:53.179
Oh, and, John?

14:53.181 --> 14:54.781
Clean yourself up.

14:54.783 --> 14:58.418
I can smell the booze from here.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.795
(Cell phone ringing)

15:15.402 --> 15:17.770
So, who are you avoiding?

15:17.772 --> 15:19.272
This guy from work.

15:19.274 --> 15:20.740
Your boss?

15:20.742 --> 15:23.676
Was. He thinks he still is.

15:32.286 --> 15:34.954
I'm quitting my job.

15:34.956 --> 15:36.589
Okay.

15:36.591 --> 15:38.725
Something happen?

15:38.727 --> 15:41.394
A lot of things happened.

15:41.396 --> 15:43.262
You seem worried.

15:43.264 --> 15:46.733
They don't...
like quitters.

15:46.735 --> 15:48.267
Might be a problem.

15:48.269 --> 15:50.003
You're gonna need them
for a good recommendation.

15:50.005 --> 15:52.805
Yeah, well, as long as they
don't kill me, I'll be happy.

15:55.943 --> 15:58.244
Joke.
(Chuckles)

15:59.947 --> 16:02.348
So, uh, what are you gonna do?

16:02.350 --> 16:03.950
What do you mean?

16:03.952 --> 16:06.152
I mean next.

16:07.855 --> 16:10.823
(Sighs)
Something different.

16:10.825 --> 16:14.827
Do you have any
marketable skills?

16:14.829 --> 16:17.597
Marketable? I don't know.

16:17.599 --> 16:19.365
Any skills?

16:19.367 --> 16:21.267
Not really.

16:21.269 --> 16:23.369
Do you have a degree?

16:23.371 --> 16:25.772
You mean, like, a college,
grad school thing?

16:25.774 --> 16:27.173
Yeah, generally
that's what it means.

16:27.175 --> 16:29.275
- No.
- Really?

16:29.277 --> 16:30.510
I'm shocked.

16:30.512 --> 16:32.145
- Why?
- I don't know.

16:32.147 --> 16:34.647
You seem...

16:34.649 --> 16:37.784
sophisticated.

16:37.786 --> 16:40.920
With your half gallon of
schnapps there, of course.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.758
(Cell phone ringing)

16:48.662 --> 16:50.930
You're not gonna get that, huh?

17:27.188 --> 17:29.202

17:44.251 --> 17:46.486
(Cell phone dings, vibrates)

17:49.825 --> 17:51.894
_

18:16.116 --> 18:17.884
I need to go
to The Sadirah Hotel.

18:17.886 --> 18:19.418
We're in lockdown, ma'am.

18:19.420 --> 18:20.787
According to the transport log,
limited pouch runs

18:20.789 --> 18:22.488
to allied embassies are cleared.

18:22.490 --> 18:25.124
Rolling drop at The Sadirah and
then on to the Swedish embassy

18:25.126 --> 18:27.326
to deliver this.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.621
ISI.

18:55.623 --> 18:57.323
They sit out here
waiting for us in shifts.

18:57.325 --> 19:00.793
We can't go anywhere
without them.

19:00.795 --> 19:02.461
Carrie:
Forget the embassy.

19:02.463 --> 19:04.263
Just dump me at The Sadirah
and wait for me there.

19:04.265 --> 19:06.032
Want to share with us
where you're going?

19:06.034 --> 19:07.700
I'll never be more than
ten minutes away.

19:07.702 --> 19:09.602
If I need you, I'll call.

19:30.157 --> 19:32.191
I shouldn't be
more than an hour.

How was the trip in?

21:51.833 --> 21:53.165
(British accent):
Fine.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.167
Taxi from the airport
was a little hairy.

21:55.169 --> 21:57.036
Been working on the accent.

21:57.038 --> 21:58.804
- Good.
Max: - Good?

It's flawless.

Hello, Max.

Evening, Governor.
Pip, pip. Cheerio.

22:10.351 --> 22:11.784
He's back at school.

22:11.786 --> 22:13.219
Seems to be trying to
get back to his life.

22:13.221 --> 22:15.221
Which is pretty impressive

22:17.125 --> 22:18.357
When are we making
the approach?

22:18.359 --> 22:19.525
Tomorrow morning.

22:19.527 --> 22:20.960
Talk me through it.

22:20.962 --> 22:22.628
It's gonna take place
at the medical college

22:22.630 --> 22:24.196
in the office of his
advisor, where we think

22:24.198 --> 22:25.798
he'll feel safe and respected.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.867
Smart.
Who's the advisor?

22:27.869 --> 22:29.535
Dr. Malik Gorshani.

22:29.537 --> 22:31.070
He's chief of their
neurology department.

22:31.072 --> 22:33.873
Neurology-- that's
the nervous system, right?

22:33.875 --> 22:36.342
That's... perfect.

22:36.344 --> 22:38.544
Why? You're nervous?

22:38.546 --> 22:40.079
Well, of course.

22:40.081 --> 22:41.647
It's the start of an operation.
It's good.

22:41.649 --> 22:43.249
It's good to be nervous.
It keeps you focused.

22:43.251 --> 22:44.550
My heart's going
like a steam engine.

22:44.552 --> 22:46.218
Use that energy.

22:46.220 --> 22:49.055
You're a journalist; this is
your chance at a big story.

22:49.057 --> 22:50.856
The best operations
are 90% true.

22:50.858 --> 22:52.558
Right.
You are recruiting him,

22:52.560 --> 22:54.727
just not for the reason
that he thinks.

22:54.729 --> 22:56.195
And don't press too hard.

22:56.197 --> 22:57.730
The objective is a follow-up
meeting, nothing more.

22:57.732 --> 22:59.031
How could he say no?

22:59.033 --> 23:00.900
- Max.
- Well...

23:00.902 --> 23:02.201
It is a seduction, Fara.

23:02.203 --> 23:03.602
There's just no way around it.

23:03.604 --> 23:05.538
Make physical contact
if you can.

23:05.540 --> 23:08.874
Touch his shoulder.
Put a hand gently on his arm.

23:08.876 --> 23:10.042
You're gonna do fine, Fara.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.447

I got to get this.

It's my dad.

23:16.551 --> 23:18.784
(Speaking Arabic)

23:21.721 --> 23:23.456
She gonna be okay?

23:24.758 --> 23:26.292
Be careful out there, Max.

23:26.294 --> 23:28.027
The streets
are crawling with ISI.

23:28.029 --> 23:29.261
And you're without
official cover.

23:29.263 --> 23:30.296
What about the embassy?

23:30.298 --> 23:31.430
Totally in the dark.

23:31.432 --> 23:32.865
Langley?

23:32.867 --> 23:34.233
Langley knows,
but they can't help you out

23:34.235 --> 23:35.234
if you get in trouble.

23:35.236 --> 23:37.470
Then we won't.

23:40.207 --> 23:42.908
(Knocking)

23:42.910 --> 23:45.544
All right, all right!
I'm coming.

23:48.248 --> 23:50.916
I told you to go fuck yourself,
not come for breakfast.

23:50.918 --> 23:52.451
Come on, Peter!
Let me in.

23:52.453 --> 23:55.187
I brought donuts.

23:58.925 --> 24:00.092
Just you.

24:00.094 --> 24:01.527
Whatever you say.

24:05.098 --> 24:07.466
I won't go to Langley,
so Langley comes to me.

24:07.468 --> 24:09.168
Is that what this is?

24:09.170 --> 24:11.337
Can you not accept that I'm
genuinely concerned about you?

24:11.339 --> 24:12.605
So why the gorilla?

24:12.607 --> 24:14.907
Jay? He's just my driver.

24:14.909 --> 24:16.108
Well, I appreciate the concern,

24:16.110 --> 24:17.576
- but I'm fine, thank you.
- Mmm.

24:19.479 --> 24:20.613
So I can see.

24:20.615 --> 24:21.847
So I had a few beers.

24:21.849 --> 24:23.015
I need help sleeping.
Big deal.

24:23.017 --> 24:24.283
The group takes
care of its own.

24:24.285 --> 24:25.651
You know that,
and you know why.

24:25.653 --> 24:27.653
I don't belong to you,
or to the group,

24:27.655 --> 24:29.255
or to anyone anymore.

24:29.257 --> 24:30.689
Once a scalp hunter,
always a scalp hunter.

24:30.691 --> 24:31.790
Isn't that what they say?

24:31.792 --> 24:33.025
That's what you say.

24:33.027 --> 24:34.527
That and "You're my guy, Peter."

24:34.529 --> 24:36.695
Well, I invested a lot
of time and money in you.

24:36.697 --> 24:37.796
I'm sorry to disappoint.

24:37.798 --> 24:38.931
You should be sorry.

24:38.933 --> 24:40.299
Those morons in the diner

24:40.301 --> 24:42.101
didn't deserve that.

24:47.174 --> 24:48.974
All right, so what now?

24:48.976 --> 24:50.776
Simple.

24:50.778 --> 24:52.978
Convince me that you can keep
your shit together from now on.

24:52.980 --> 24:54.346
Or else what?

24:55.515 --> 24:59.285
I believe they call it
"retraining."

25:01.121 --> 25:02.388
Of course, we both know

25:02.390 --> 25:04.023
the real explanation
for all this.

25:04.025 --> 25:04.990
What's that?

25:04.992 --> 25:07.626
This isn't about PTSD.

25:07.628 --> 25:09.895
It's about your feelings
for Carrie Mathison.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.798
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:12.800 --> 25:13.999
If she hadn't been in that car,

25:14.001 --> 25:15.668
Sandy Bachman would be
alive today.

25:15.670 --> 25:17.136
That really what you think?

25:17.138 --> 25:18.137
Tell me I'm wrong.

25:18.139 --> 25:19.905
You're wrong.

25:19.907 --> 25:22.841
I did all I could, and you can
watch it online for fuck's sake!

25:22.843 --> 25:24.143
I've seen it!

25:24.145 --> 25:26.645
The whole fucking
Agency's seen it.

25:26.647 --> 25:29.248
You took your eye off Sandy
to save Carrie.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.517
You left him to be beaten
to death in the str...

25:31.519 --> 25:33.152
(Choking)

25:45.398 --> 25:47.633
(Both panting)

25:52.772 --> 25:55.407
Well done, Peter.

25:55.409 --> 25:58.477
I knew you weren't
that far gone.

26:00.213 --> 26:02.514
Get the fuck out of here.

26:05.285 --> 26:07.786
Have a nice life.

26:33.213 --> 26:34.947
No one.

faintly over earphones)

I was stretched out

27:28.102 --> 27:30.969
in the lobby of The
Commodore Hotel.

27:30.971 --> 27:33.539
(Laughs): Who was
that awful night manager?

27:33.541 --> 27:35.441
He was Austrian?
Edward something?

27:35.443 --> 27:36.375
Amadeus.

27:36.377 --> 27:38.177
Edward Amadeus. Right.

27:38.179 --> 27:39.445
What a creep.

27:39.447 --> 27:41.046
"Would you like
a view of the sea,

27:41.048 --> 27:43.148
- or the war?"
- (Laughs)

27:43.150 --> 27:44.950
Saul.

27:44.952 --> 27:46.018
Hello, Carrie.

27:46.020 --> 27:48.854
What's going on?

27:48.856 --> 27:50.723
Didn't you see
your new security team?

27:50.725 --> 27:52.391
They're right outside,
unloading their gear.

27:52.393 --> 27:55.127
Well, I hardly expected you
to hand deliver them.

27:55.129 --> 27:58.230
Listen, I'll catch you later.

27:58.232 --> 27:59.465
Carrie:
No, no. Please.

27:59.467 --> 28:00.632
I didn't mean to interrupt.

28:00.634 --> 28:01.867
Not at all.

28:01.869 --> 28:03.135
It was great to see you.

28:03.137 --> 28:05.037
- You, too.
- Carrie.

28:06.906 --> 28:08.640
You lucked out with her.

28:08.642 --> 28:11.377
She's one of the good ones.

28:12.579 --> 28:14.780
Walk with me, will you?

28:17.384 --> 28:18.550
What the hell, Saul?

28:18.552 --> 28:20.152
So, you're not so
happy to see me?

28:20.154 --> 28:21.153
I am not.

28:21.155 --> 28:22.488
Can I ask why?

28:22.490 --> 28:23.655
I just got here myself.

28:23.657 --> 28:25.023
I've got enough on my plate

28:25.025 --> 28:26.392
without being responsible
for the safety

28:26.394 --> 28:27.526
of a former director.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.094
I'm only here for a few days.

28:30.497 --> 28:32.097
All right. A week.

28:32.099 --> 28:33.665
You should've called first.

28:33.667 --> 28:35.367
You're right, I should've.
But now that I'm here...

28:35.369 --> 28:36.835
Now that you're here,

28:36.837 --> 28:38.237
it looks like I've reached out
to you for help.

28:38.239 --> 28:40.172
That's not exactly the message
I want to send.

28:40.174 --> 28:43.308
- Well, now that I'm here,
do you need my help? - No.

28:46.780 --> 28:48.781
Yes.

28:48.783 --> 28:50.849
What can I do?

28:50.851 --> 28:53.285
One thing, and then
promise me you'll go home.

28:53.287 --> 28:54.686
I promise.

28:54.688 --> 28:57.856
The Ambassador's got
the embassy locked down.

28:57.858 --> 28:59.525
I need your friend
to lift the order

28:59.527 --> 29:01.393
so my case officers
can get back to work.

29:01.395 --> 29:03.362
Done.

29:29.989 --> 29:31.123
(British accent):
Hello, Aayan.

29:31.125 --> 29:33.992
Aayan, this is Fara Sassani,

29:33.994 --> 29:36.295
the journalist from London
I was telling you about.

29:36.297 --> 29:37.396
Nice to meet you.

29:37.398 --> 29:38.630
Nice to meet you.

29:38.632 --> 29:40.466
Dr. Gorshani.

29:46.739 --> 29:48.240
Well, you're a brave young man.

29:48.242 --> 29:49.408
Thanks for meeting me.

29:49.410 --> 29:50.909
The only reason I'm here is

29:50.911 --> 29:52.611
because Dr. Gorshani insisted
that I meet with you.

29:52.613 --> 29:53.645
Okay.

29:53.647 --> 29:54.746
No, not "Okay."

29:54.748 --> 29:56.181
Done that. Met you.

29:56.183 --> 29:57.349
I'm gonna go now.

29:57.351 --> 29:59.284
Aayan, please.

29:59.286 --> 30:00.752
I've come a long way.

30:00.754 --> 30:02.154
You don't understand.
Even if you are

30:02.156 --> 30:03.822
who you say you are,
I can't talk to you.

30:03.824 --> 30:06.225
What do you mean,
if I am who I say I am?

30:10.163 --> 30:12.798
Are you in some kind of trouble?

30:12.800 --> 30:14.633
I have to go.

30:14.635 --> 30:16.468
Aayan, please.

30:16.470 --> 30:18.537
Sorry.

30:18.539 --> 30:21.974
Don't be. We don't have to do
this now, if you don't want to.

30:21.976 --> 30:23.942
We can meet tomorrow.

30:23.944 --> 30:25.210
Or next week.

30:25.212 --> 30:26.678
Just please, please
leave me alone.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.781
Please.

30:37.490 --> 30:39.725
(Crowd clamoring over video)

30:55.408 --> 30:57.643
(Clamoring continues)

31:18.264 --> 31:20.365
Quinn:
<i>It's under the seat!</i>

31:20.367 --> 31:21.900
It's not here!

31:23.236 --> 31:24.870
Fuck!

31:24.872 --> 31:26.071
Help!

31:26.073 --> 31:27.039
Get off me!

31:27.041 --> 31:28.941
Carrie!

31:30.543 --> 31:33.245
Sandy:
Help me! Quinn!

31:34.080 --> 31:35.614
Carrie, no!

31:35.616 --> 31:36.915
Can't just leave him here!

31:36.917 --> 31:38.417
He's gone!
There's nothing we can do!

31:38.419 --> 31:39.751
Now, get down!

31:47.594 --> 31:49.962
You couldn't get through
to him because he was scared?

31:49.964 --> 31:52.698
Fara: He wasn't just scared,
he was terrified.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.566
What were his exact words?

31:54.568 --> 31:56.768
It wasn't what he said,
it was the look on his face.

31:56.770 --> 31:58.103
I felt so bad for him.

31:58.105 --> 32:00.038
The thing is,
he just got more valuable.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.974
The fact that he's being told
to shut up means

32:01.976 --> 32:03.775
he knows something
or saw something.

32:05.078 --> 32:06.878
What about a second approach?

32:06.880 --> 32:09.982
Happy to try, but I doubt the
result would be any different.

32:09.984 --> 32:11.416
Is a snatch and grab
out of the question?

32:11.418 --> 32:13.118
No way I get authorization
to interrogate

32:13.120 --> 32:15.954
the only surviving victim
of a botched kill mission.

32:15.956 --> 32:18.991
What then?

32:18.993 --> 32:22.227
Let me think on it.

32:28.601 --> 32:30.836
(Door opens)

32:37.010 --> 32:39.144
Best view in Islamabad.

32:39.146 --> 32:41.480
(Laughs) Which
isn't saying much.

32:46.085 --> 32:48.587
I thought you were gonna
join us for dinner.

32:48.589 --> 32:49.755
I got busy.

32:49.757 --> 32:51.990
Yeah, I heard.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.460
If you've got something
to say, just say it.

32:55.462 --> 32:57.462
You were outside the embassy,

32:57.464 --> 33:00.799
in violation of my order.

33:00.801 --> 33:02.300
Who told you that?

33:02.302 --> 33:03.301
Redmond?

33:03.303 --> 33:04.970
No.

33:04.972 --> 33:07.906
Really.

33:10.710 --> 33:13.445
How about we start again,
you and me?

33:13.447 --> 33:16.515
Funny. Saul just
suggested the same thing.

33:17.483 --> 33:20.018
And?

33:20.020 --> 33:22.521
Hey, I'm all for it.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.625
He likes you, Saul does.

33:26.627 --> 33:28.627
He doesn't like many people.

33:28.629 --> 33:30.228
Well, I should hope so.

33:30.230 --> 33:31.997
We almost got married once.

33:31.999 --> 33:33.899
What?

33:33.901 --> 33:37.369
We were young, we were
stupid, it was Beirut.

33:37.371 --> 33:40.205
Thank God we came
to our senses.

33:41.841 --> 33:43.809
He never said a word.

33:43.811 --> 33:46.778
How very discreet of him.

33:49.348 --> 33:51.883
But I want you to know
I'm not doing it for him.

33:51.885 --> 33:54.186
Doing what?

33:54.188 --> 33:56.755
Rescinding the lockdown.

33:56.757 --> 33:59.091
You're not?

33:59.093 --> 34:01.493
I'm doing it because
you were right.

34:01.495 --> 34:04.996
I can't complain about bad
relations with Pakistan,

34:04.998 --> 34:07.699
while at the same doing
nothing to make them better.

34:07.701 --> 34:10.034
Thank you.

34:10.036 --> 34:11.870
Well, don't thank me yet.

34:11.871 --> 34:13.672
I want enhanced security
measures in place first,

34:13.674 --> 34:16.208
and I want daily
updates from you.

34:16.210 --> 34:17.409
In person.

34:17.411 --> 34:19.610
Deal.

34:26.018 --> 34:28.286
Smoke another with me?

34:31.190 --> 34:33.425
Sure.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.973
(Clattering)

35:13.266 --> 35:14.633
What are you doing?

35:14.635 --> 35:15.901
You okay?

35:15.903 --> 35:17.269
You went out
pretty hard last night.

35:17.271 --> 35:18.670
I was worried.

35:18.672 --> 35:19.971
What are you doing?

35:19.973 --> 35:21.306
Just policing the
area a little bit.

35:21.308 --> 35:22.607
I see that.

35:22.609 --> 35:24.009
You know, dust
quickly becomes dirt,

35:24.011 --> 35:25.510
and then before you know it,
you owe me

35:25.512 --> 35:27.245
your entire security deposit.

35:27.247 --> 35:28.814
Can you just stop?

35:28.816 --> 35:30.115
What? Cleaning?

35:30.117 --> 35:32.184
Talking.

35:43.196 --> 35:45.163
Did I do something wrong here?

35:45.165 --> 35:48.333
No, I just think
you should leave now.

35:52.638 --> 35:54.506
Okay, I'll go.

35:54.508 --> 35:55.807
Okay.

35:55.809 --> 35:58.043
I'll get my stuff.

36:06.052 --> 36:08.386
(Sighs)

36:08.388 --> 36:09.988
Can I say something

36:09.990 --> 36:12.524
before I go?

36:14.293 --> 36:18.363
All this-- it has to do with
that CIA guy on the news, right?

36:18.365 --> 36:19.798
Couldn't help overhear.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.634
You don't know what you heard
or didn't hear.

36:22.636 --> 36:23.902
Do you understand?

36:23.904 --> 36:25.070
Jesus!

36:25.072 --> 36:26.738
Peter, you're scaring me.

36:26.740 --> 36:27.839
You should be scared.

36:27.841 --> 36:30.942
These people do not fuck around.

36:31.811 --> 36:33.812
(Scoffs quietly)

36:33.814 --> 36:36.481
What I wanted...

36:36.483 --> 36:38.583
to say to you...

36:38.585 --> 36:42.354
is that nobody should have to go
through what you went through.

36:42.356 --> 36:44.656
Nobody.

36:44.658 --> 36:47.659
And if that guy shows up here
again, I'd say it to his face.

36:51.097 --> 36:53.999
I'd like to see that.

36:55.935 --> 36:58.603
I really would.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.109
I went to the store, you know.

37:04.111 --> 37:07.245
There's, um...
a, uh, roast chicken

37:07.247 --> 37:09.381
in the fridge
and some eggs and cereal,

37:09.383 --> 37:12.183
you know, to go along
with your liquid diet.

37:14.287 --> 37:16.321
And, um...

37:17.757 --> 37:21.159
whoever Carrie is...

37:22.762 --> 37:25.830
she's a lucky girl.

37:28.701 --> 37:32.203
(Door opens, closes)

37:41.280 --> 37:43.515
♪

38:11.410 --> 38:13.611
Morning.

38:13.613 --> 38:15.313
Lockdown is lifted.

38:15.315 --> 38:16.915
Hallelujah.

38:16.917 --> 38:19.017
What else can I do for you?

38:19.019 --> 38:21.553
Go home.

38:27.526 --> 38:29.761
She was your fiancee?

38:29.763 --> 38:31.429
For about two minutes.

38:31.431 --> 38:32.497
A hundred years ago.

38:32.499 --> 38:34.199
Why didn't you say anything?

38:34.201 --> 38:36.601
Well, we haven't really been
talking much lately, Carrie.

38:40.272 --> 38:41.940
I'm sorry.

38:41.942 --> 38:43.875
No need to apologize.

38:43.877 --> 38:45.610
I wanted to pick up the phone

38:45.612 --> 38:48.313
so many times, but what I wanted
to talk about, I couldn't.

38:48.315 --> 38:50.949
I still can't.

38:54.687 --> 38:56.688
Tyranny of secrets.

38:56.690 --> 38:59.024
The tyranny of keeping them.

39:00.726 --> 39:02.961
So...

39:05.698 --> 39:08.466
What are you doing today
with your newfound freedom?

39:10.569 --> 39:13.071
I can't tell you.
(Laughs)

39:13.073 --> 39:16.708
I can guess, can't I?

39:16.710 --> 39:17.909
Sure.

39:17.911 --> 39:19.677
You got two problems,
far as I see.

39:19.679 --> 39:22.914
One, you need to get Sandy's
networks up and running again.

39:22.916 --> 39:24.249
Check.

39:24.251 --> 39:25.850
Two, you don't know
who you can trust yet.

39:25.852 --> 39:28.219
So you need to set up
a second station somewhere,

39:28.221 --> 39:30.789
with your own people,
independent of the embassy.

39:33.059 --> 39:34.993
You done that already?

39:37.563 --> 39:39.264
Wow.

39:39.266 --> 39:41.466
That was quick.

39:49.775 --> 39:51.743
When's your plane, Saul?

39:51.745 --> 39:54.112
Tomorrow morning.

39:54.114 --> 39:56.781
Thank you.

39:56.783 --> 39:59.617
Happy hunting.

40:17.603 --> 40:20.405
Here's your coffee.

40:51.170 --> 40:52.971
Hello?

Hello? Can you hear me?

40:58.244 --> 40:59.978
(Groaning, crying)

40:59.980 --> 41:02.313
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.

41:02.315 --> 41:03.982
I can help you.

41:03.984 --> 41:06.251
You're in trouble, Aayan.

41:06.253 --> 41:08.419
Who are you?

41:08.421 --> 41:10.588
My name is Carrie MacPherson.

41:10.590 --> 41:12.090
Fara Sassani works for me.

41:12.092 --> 41:13.591
Another journalist?

41:13.593 --> 41:15.026
I'm her London Bureau Chief.

41:15.028 --> 41:16.327
Let me go, please.

41:17.596 --> 41:18.997
Let me out! Please!

41:18.999 --> 41:20.865
Let me go!
(Grunts)

41:20.867 --> 41:22.467
(Shushes)

41:22.469 --> 41:23.701
(Whispers):
Hold on.

41:23.703 --> 41:25.904
(Shushing)

41:31.677 --> 41:35.213
No, I thought I heard somebody.

41:35.215 --> 41:37.715
Listen, Aayan.

41:37.717 --> 41:40.051
You are part
of an important story.

41:40.053 --> 41:42.620
I want to be
the one to tell it.

41:42.622 --> 41:44.556
On behalf of your family,

41:44.558 --> 41:46.991
all the people who were
killed at Dande Darpa Khel

41:46.993 --> 41:49.794
and all those who may yet die
at the hands of the CIA.

41:49.796 --> 41:51.229
I can't tell you.

41:51.231 --> 41:52.630
You don't understand.
I cannot talk to you.

41:52.632 --> 41:53.665
Wh-what are you scared of?

41:53.667 --> 41:55.466
Who's threatening you?

41:55.468 --> 41:57.969
Because I can
protect you, Aayan.

41:57.971 --> 41:59.671
I can even get you
out of Pakistan,

41:59.673 --> 42:02.040
if that's what you want.

42:05.911 --> 42:07.979
- In exchange for what?
- I told you.

42:07.981 --> 42:10.582
Your story.

42:11.650 --> 42:13.184
- I can't do...
- Do you want to continue

42:13.186 --> 42:15.486
your studies in England
or the United States?

42:15.488 --> 42:17.222
I can do that, too.

42:17.224 --> 42:19.190
How does the Royal College
of Physicians sound?

42:19.192 --> 42:20.925
(Mumbles):
Royal College of Physicians?

42:20.927 --> 42:23.661
It's not a problem.

42:26.165 --> 42:30.835
I'm putting my card
in your pocket, okay?

42:41.046 --> 42:44.182
You won't ever see me again
if you don't want to.

42:46.018 --> 42:48.519
But you should want to.

42:48.521 --> 42:51.489
Especially if you're in
any kind of danger.

42:53.092 --> 42:54.792
Look, look, I don't want...

42:54.794 --> 42:55.927
Go, go, go.

42:55.929 --> 42:57.528
Tell them I had
women's problems.

42:57.530 --> 42:59.197
I was cramping.

43:00.766 --> 43:03.167
Whatever you decide...

43:04.737 --> 43:08.373
I'm truly sorry for
what happened to you.

43:08.375 --> 43:11.509
And I wish you luck.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.327
(Chuckles quietly)

43:29.329 --> 43:31.562
(Crowd clamoring over video)

44:01.193 --> 44:03.428
♪

44:27.886 --> 44:29.620
♪

44:39.898 --> 44:42.467
Fuck me.

44:54.146 --> 44:56.381
(Microwave beeping)

45:15.434 --> 45:17.769
(Cell phone ringing)

45:29.114 --> 45:31.682
Please don't say
you pocket-dialed me.

45:31.684 --> 45:33.618
We never had a chance.

45:33.620 --> 45:35.353
What do you mean?

45:35.355 --> 45:37.255
In the car with Sandy.

45:37.257 --> 45:39.056
What makes you say that?
Are you all right?

45:39.058 --> 45:40.925
It was premeditated-- the whole
thing from start to finish.

45:40.927 --> 45:42.693
There was a guy in the crowd

45:42.695 --> 45:44.862
with an earpiece
coordinating the whole thing.

45:44.864 --> 45:46.030
Are you sure?

45:46.032 --> 45:47.365
I just sent you the link.

45:47.367 --> 45:48.699
Go to your computer.

45:48.701 --> 45:50.668
Uh, hold on.

45:59.211 --> 46:01.879
All right, got it.

46:01.881 --> 46:04.282
See the guy on the corner?

46:04.284 --> 46:06.150
Yeah.

46:06.152 --> 46:09.654
He's wearing a comm, Carrie.

46:09.656 --> 46:12.390
Jesus, Quinn.

46:12.392 --> 46:14.859
We never had a chance.

46:18.664 --> 46:19.730
You recognize him?

46:19.732 --> 46:21.232
I don't.

46:21.234 --> 46:22.967
But he's got to be
Pakistani intelligence, right?

46:22.969 --> 46:25.736
No one else could've pulled
something like this off.

46:25.738 --> 46:28.105
The question is...

46:28.107 --> 46:29.740
why?

46:29.742 --> 46:30.942
What do you mean?

46:30.944 --> 46:32.443
Well, Sandy was blown.

46:32.445 --> 46:34.145
He was already gonna
have to leave the country.

46:34.147 --> 46:36.247
Why kill him?

46:41.153 --> 46:42.787
Quinn.

46:42.789 --> 46:45.790
What?

46:45.792 --> 46:47.592
This changes everything.

46:47.594 --> 46:50.928
It means I really need you now.

46:53.765 --> 46:56.033
No, I'm sorry, Carrie.
I can't do that.

46:56.035 --> 46:57.335
I wouldn't ask you if there was

46:57.337 --> 46:59.070
somebody else here
I could count on.

47:01.773 --> 47:04.709
Don't make me beg.

47:04.711 --> 47:06.644
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

47:06.646 --> 47:08.913
Please. Please!

47:10.682 --> 47:12.517
Shit, Carrie.

47:12.519 --> 47:14.118
I know.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.921
You're the hardest person
in the world to say no to.

47:18.690 --> 47:20.892
Is that a yes?

47:28.534 --> 47:30.234
God, I fucking love you, Quinn.

47:30.236 --> 47:32.737
You know that, don't you?

47:34.506 --> 47:36.741
Yeah.

47:56.728 --> 47:58.429
(Sighs)
