00:00.027 --> 00:01.694
What do you know about Jessica Ford?

00:01.697 --> 00:02.828
She was my mother.

00:02.831 --> 00:04.898
You were in command at the Shiloh siege.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.234
You got Tactical too close.

00:07.236 --> 00:08.535
I don't pose any threat to Mr. Beaumont.

00:08.537 --> 00:10.704
Emotions <i> are</i> a threat.

00:10.706 --> 00:13.640
And let's be honest, Maxine,
you bring a lot of emotion.

00:13.642 --> 00:14.908
Mr. Beaumont.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.444
Why would you hire me
if you knew who my mother was?

00:17.446 --> 00:19.112
The question isn't why I hired you.

00:19.114 --> 00:21.314
It's why you'd want to work
for the man who got her killed.

00:21.316 --> 00:23.516
You know Damien Delaine's up for parole?

00:23.518 --> 00:25.518
Has he tried to contact you?

00:25.520 --> 00:27.687
I... I haven't spoken to him.

00:27.689 --> 00:30.156
Good.

00:30.158 --> 00:31.559
Keep it that way.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.480 --> 00:53.880
Okay.

00:53.882 --> 00:55.415
You can do this.

01:01.023 --> 01:02.589
Can I see your ID, please?

01:02.591 --> 01:03.924
Sure.

01:05.394 --> 01:06.493
Thank you very much.

01:12.134 --> 01:14.067
Thank you. Open the gate!

01:35.357 --> 01:36.490
Eric.

01:36.492 --> 01:38.458
Hey, just checking you got
everything you need.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.260
Well, apart from a good night's sleep.

01:40.262 --> 01:41.962
I stayed up going over
the protocols again.

01:41.964 --> 01:43.730
I wouldn't send you
on a risk assessment alone

01:43.732 --> 01:46.466
unless I knew you were
ready for it, and you are.

01:46.468 --> 01:48.702
Thanks, boss.

01:52.941 --> 01:54.941
I never should have let you
talk me into that.

01:54.943 --> 01:56.877
As if I could.

01:56.879 --> 01:58.745
Uh-huh.

01:58.747 --> 02:00.547
Yeah? Mm. Mm.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.552
Come in.

02:05.554 --> 02:07.821
Sir, Miss Carlson is here for you.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.823
Thank you, Agent Stokes.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.858
Crisis resolution must be
pretty good, Miss Carlson,

02:11.860 --> 02:13.960
for the FBI to kick this over
to a private contractor.

02:13.962 --> 02:16.096
Well, my boss, Eric Beaumont,

02:16.098 --> 02:18.565
wrote the FBI's
risk assessment protocols.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.168
Have you done many of these?

02:21.170 --> 02:22.569
Not many.

02:23.505 --> 02:25.305
Have you had any further contact

02:25.307 --> 02:26.640
since the voice message?

02:26.642 --> 02:28.341
Radio silence.

02:28.343 --> 02:30.210
And the voice said,

02:30.212 --> 02:33.280
"Give up your access codes,
or I pay with your life."

02:33.282 --> 02:35.882
Yeah, I think those
were the exact words.

02:35.884 --> 02:37.184
The voice was computerized,

02:37.186 --> 02:39.186
and I didn't get a chance to record it.

02:39.188 --> 02:41.888
What kind of access codes
is he demanding?

02:41.890 --> 02:43.824
To a top-secret data center...

02:43.826 --> 02:46.226
The kind we used to protect
western democracies

02:46.228 --> 02:48.195
from every kind of terrorist
attack you can imagine.

02:48.197 --> 02:49.496
And what makes you think

02:49.498 --> 02:51.865
a threat came from
this hack-tivist, Krank?

02:51.867 --> 02:52.933
Same M.O.

02:53.737 --> 02:55.368
Krank tried to hack into our systems

02:55.370 --> 02:58.171
to steal these access codes
10 years ago.

02:58.173 --> 03:00.607
Isn't it strange that he would
suddenly reappear now?

03:00.609 --> 03:01.608
You tell me.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.076
You're the expert.

03:11.487 --> 03:13.253
Didn't you promise Evie

03:13.255 --> 03:14.621
you wouldn't track her anymore?

03:17.059 --> 03:18.225
It's for her own safety.

03:18.227 --> 03:19.860
I'm sure.

03:19.862 --> 03:22.395
The point is, you told her you wouldn't.

03:23.130 --> 03:24.998
I don't want her worrying.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.467
Your work demands you manipulate people.

03:27.469 --> 03:29.002
Your family needs the truth.

03:29.652 --> 03:31.471
Better hurry up getting dressed.

03:32.407 --> 03:33.840
She's in the hallway.

03:34.576 --> 03:36.676
Mm-hmm.

03:42.885 --> 03:44.417
Hey, mom, I'm back.

03:44.419 --> 03:46.086
Hello, sweetie.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.723
Are you gate crashing our shopping trip?

03:49.725 --> 03:51.825
Your mom's got me working again.

03:52.828 --> 03:54.528
Uh-huh.

03:57.266 --> 03:59.566
What were you saying about the truth?

04:01.997 --> 04:03.036
Excuse me.

04:05.647 --> 04:06.740
Hello?

04:08.844 --> 04:10.010
Hel...?

04:13.382 --> 04:15.582
So, what's the verdict, Miss Carlson?

04:16.255 --> 04:19.986
The threat is nonspecific
and hasn't recurred.

04:19.988 --> 04:22.155
According to our protocols,
it's low risk.

04:22.157 --> 04:25.225
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that's not a relief.

04:31.033 --> 04:31.932
Hello?

04:31.934 --> 04:32.999
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:33.001 --> 04:34.401
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:34.403 --> 04:35.402
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:35.404 --> 04:36.570
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:36.572 --> 04:37.737
It's the same voice.

04:37.739 --> 04:39.172
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:39.174 --> 04:40.240
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:40.242 --> 04:41.408
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:41.410 --> 04:42.576
<i>Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>

04:42.578 --> 04:43.910
It's Latin.

04:43.912 --> 04:45.845
"Where there is death, there is hope."

04:45.847 --> 04:49.716
<i>- Ubi mors ibi spes.</i>
- Sir? Put the phone down.

04:49.718 --> 04:51.484
Put the phone down, please.

04:51.486 --> 04:53.086
Put the phone down, now!

04:54.990 --> 04:56.756
Someone help!

04:56.758 --> 04:58.592
Oh, my God! Marcus?

04:58.594 --> 05:00.760
Agent Nash, I have you. I have you.

05:00.762 --> 05:03.230
Help! Somebody help!

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:39.098 --> 05:40.931
Maxine?

05:45.304 --> 05:47.983
Agent Nash died an hour ago.

05:48.674 --> 05:50.307
Massive brain hemorrhaging.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.775
Look at me.

05:53.379 --> 05:54.678
Look at me.

05:56.582 --> 05:58.315
This isn't your fault.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.483
You understand me?

05:59.485 --> 06:00.617
The phone exploded

06:00.619 --> 06:03.053
seconds after I told him he was safe.

06:04.081 --> 06:05.656
That phrase in Latin.

06:06.926 --> 06:08.826
"Where there is death, there is hope."

06:08.828 --> 06:12.045
It was used by the Fascists
in the Spanish Civil War.

06:12.865 --> 06:15.026
You recognized it as a threat?

06:16.126 --> 06:18.235
Just not soon enough.

06:18.237 --> 06:19.690
Mr. Beaumont?

06:20.206 --> 06:22.372
Assistant Executive
Director Woods has arrived.

06:22.374 --> 06:23.740
He requests to meet with you
immediately.

06:23.742 --> 06:25.676
All right. Come on.

06:25.678 --> 06:28.245
Ma'am, you can relax.

06:31.717 --> 06:33.984
This wasn't your fault.

06:33.986 --> 06:35.652
Either the protocols are wrong,

06:35.654 --> 06:36.720
which we know they aren't,

06:36.722 --> 06:38.055
or I screwed up.

06:38.057 --> 06:39.923
Or neither.

06:46.065 --> 06:49.900
<i>I trust Marcus
Nash's cellphone got your attention.</i>

06:49.902 --> 06:52.603
<i>That was just a taste of my power.</i>

06:52.605 --> 06:54.571
<i>I can infect any computer</i>

06:54.573 --> 06:58.075
<i>that controls
an electromechanical process.</i>

06:58.077 --> 07:02.646
<i>Cars, life-support machines,
nuclear centrifuges...</i>

07:02.648 --> 07:04.915
<i>all your critical infrastructure.</i>

07:04.917 --> 07:07.929
<i>Release the access codes
to NSA's cloud servers</i>

07:07.931 --> 07:09.184
<i>by midnight tonight,</i>

07:09.186 --> 07:10.358
<i>or I will inflict</i>

07:10.360 --> 07:12.890
<i>mass civilian casualties and chaos.</i>

07:15.013 --> 07:16.793
Can he make good on that threat?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.063
Well, our guys are analyzing the pulse

07:20.065 --> 07:23.201
that he sent through the network
to Nash's phone.

07:23.769 --> 07:25.269
Theoretically, it's possible.

07:25.271 --> 07:27.104
Yes, theoretically, yes.

07:27.106 --> 07:29.035
Well, then we have
to assume this is real.

07:29.060 --> 07:30.474
Mm-hmm.

07:30.476 --> 07:31.441
And the U.S. government

07:31.443 --> 07:34.077
does not negotiate with terrorists.

07:35.381 --> 07:38.282
No, we don't, but...

07:39.952 --> 07:42.273
14 hours and change.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.289
I'm gonna need something to offer.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.256
You'll have it.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.660
And your word, Freddie.

07:49.662 --> 07:50.894
If you want me to negotiate,

07:50.896 --> 07:52.996
then you have to let me negotiate.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.867
Right, right... no force, no tactical.

07:56.869 --> 07:58.468
Scout's honor.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.738
- One other thing.
- Hmm?

08:01.740 --> 08:03.640
I don't want the girl on this one.

08:03.642 --> 08:05.742
Maxine is my second.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.011
You and I used to be friends.

08:08.013 --> 08:09.713
I still consider us friends, Freddie.

08:09.715 --> 08:12.115
All right, all right,
then listen to me on this one.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.751
Look, I know you feel responsible

08:14.753 --> 08:16.803
for Jessica Ford's death at Shiloh.

08:17.423 --> 08:20.023
But hiring her daughter,

08:20.025 --> 08:21.725
you don't see that as a mistake.

08:21.727 --> 08:23.594
This was a targeted assassination,

08:23.596 --> 08:26.296
timed to occur at precisely the moment

08:26.298 --> 08:27.664
Maxine was with Nash.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.299
Why would they do that?

08:29.301 --> 08:30.400
I don't know.

08:30.402 --> 08:31.768
Yet.

08:33.038 --> 08:35.639
My team. My way.

08:47.019 --> 08:49.019
- Did you reach Maxine?
- Yeah.

08:49.021 --> 08:52.389
Yeah, she is shaken, blaming herself.

08:53.002 --> 08:54.157
Should she?

08:54.159 --> 08:55.993
I mean, she followed protocol.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.494
So what happened?

08:57.496 --> 08:59.229
Well, that's them now.

09:00.232 --> 09:01.798
Hey, Max.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.322
- Hey.
- Hang in there.

09:03.324 --> 09:05.369
I'll be fine once we stop this guy.

09:05.371 --> 09:06.336
Well, Krank left

09:06.338 --> 09:08.305
no e-mail address, no phone number.

09:08.307 --> 09:10.507
We've got 14 hours
and no way to contact him.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.276
There's someone else we can talk to.

09:12.278 --> 09:13.477
The electromagnetic pulse

09:13.479 --> 09:15.279
that Krank used
to make that phone explode

09:15.281 --> 09:17.080
was written in a complex
programming language

09:17.082 --> 09:18.048
called "Coma."

09:18.050 --> 09:19.449
So complex,

09:19.451 --> 09:21.285
only a handful of people
know how to write it.

09:21.287 --> 09:23.153
It was developed
by a professor at Chicago Tech

09:23.155 --> 09:24.888
in the early '90s.

09:31.096 --> 09:32.329
Damien Delaine.

09:33.332 --> 09:35.065
Damien Delaine?

09:36.168 --> 09:38.635
Isn't he serving 17 years
for the massacre at Shiloh?

09:38.637 --> 09:39.868
<i>Was.</i>

09:40.472 --> 09:43.807
Paroled for good behavior last week.

09:43.809 --> 09:44.908
Oh.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.614
Last week?

09:46.616 --> 09:48.512
So, he was still in prison

09:48.514 --> 09:50.347
when Agent Nash originally
received the threat.

09:50.349 --> 09:53.450
Okay, only a handful of people
in the world

09:53.452 --> 09:54.918
know how to read this computer language.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.521
If Damien Delaine's
not behind this attack,

09:57.523 --> 09:58.855
he might know who is.

09:58.857 --> 10:00.249
All right, talk to him.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.625
All right.

10:01.627 --> 10:02.893
Okay.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.929
You okay?

10:06.521 --> 10:07.926
Talking about Delaine

10:07.928 --> 10:09.299
must bring back strong emotions for you,

10:09.301 --> 10:12.169
considering his involvement
in your mother's death.

10:12.171 --> 10:14.004
It does for me.

10:14.006 --> 10:15.939
I can handle it.

10:25.530 --> 10:28.016
_

10:28.053 --> 10:30.454
Do you think what I'm thinking?

10:30.456 --> 10:31.455
Six months ago,

10:31.457 --> 10:33.690
Maxine Carlson appears in our lives.

10:33.692 --> 10:36.993
And suddenly, we get a case
involving Damien Delaine,

10:36.995 --> 10:39.663
the man who's responsible
for her mother's death

10:39.665 --> 10:42.499
who Eric hasn't seen
or spoken to in 17 years.

10:42.501 --> 10:43.734
Damien Delaine convinced

10:43.736 --> 10:45.702
some 50-some odd people at Shiloh

10:45.704 --> 10:47.637
that suicide was a better option
than living.

10:49.174 --> 10:50.941
Get your game face on.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.642
And remember, we need his help.

10:56.682 --> 10:57.781
I'm Zara Hallam.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.202
This is my colleague, Oliver Yates.

11:01.053 --> 11:02.619
Thank you for agreeing to come in.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.989
I was so grateful to receive this call.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.661
17 years in prison, that's a long time.

11:11.663 --> 11:13.864
How does it feel to be on the outside?

11:14.449 --> 11:16.800
17 years gives you
a lot of sleepless hours

11:16.802 --> 11:20.003
to think about the people
that lost their lives,

11:20.028 --> 11:22.406
the families that I tore apart.

11:22.408 --> 11:24.441
Now you're rehabilitated?

11:24.443 --> 11:26.710
I was wrong.

11:26.712 --> 11:29.880
I thought I had a cause.

11:29.882 --> 11:33.490
I thought... many things,

11:33.492 --> 11:35.652
misguided things.

11:36.227 --> 11:37.888
So, please,

11:38.420 --> 11:41.691
if there's any small way
I can help you with your case,

11:41.693 --> 11:44.694
you have no idea
how much that would mean to me.

11:44.696 --> 11:47.597
And you bear no ill will
against Eric Beaumont?

11:48.314 --> 11:51.568
Eric Beaumont is
a manipulator and a hypocrite

11:51.570 --> 11:54.838
who bears
as much responsibility as I do,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.239
if not more so,

11:56.241 --> 11:57.607
for the deaths at Shiloh.

11:57.609 --> 12:01.378
We both consider Eric
a mentor and a friend.

12:02.027 --> 12:04.581
I've paid for my crimes, Miss Hallam.

12:04.583 --> 12:07.584
Eric Beaumont has not,

12:07.586 --> 12:11.922
but that does not
diminish my genuine desire

12:11.924 --> 12:14.925
to help you if I can.

12:22.768 --> 12:24.501
A person calling themselves "Krank"

12:24.503 --> 12:27.978
used these codes to blow up a cellphone

12:28.774 --> 12:30.707
and the man holding it.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.783
Well, no wonder you can't read this.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.551
This is Coma.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.720
Can you help us identify
the person who wrote it?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.956
It has to be Victoria Locke.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.624
She's a former student of mine.

12:47.626 --> 12:51.394
British. She'd be in her late 30s now.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.531
How certain are you that it's her?

12:54.533 --> 12:56.222
Well, Coma was Victoria's thesis.

12:56.224 --> 12:58.215
Others could write simple programs,

12:58.217 --> 13:01.834
but to pull off what you described.

13:02.474 --> 13:03.673
It can't be anyone else.

13:03.675 --> 13:05.342
Nice theory.

13:05.344 --> 13:06.409
Slight problem.

13:07.335 --> 13:10.192
Victoria Locke died in 2007.

13:22.977 --> 13:24.644
<i>People are asleep,</i>

13:24.646 --> 13:28.948
<i>walking around in daydreams
while the rich get richer,</i>

13:28.950 --> 13:31.351
<i>and the government destructs us
with consumerism</i>

13:31.353 --> 13:33.252
<i>as they watch our every move.</i>

13:33.254 --> 13:34.687
<i>We let them control us.</i>

13:34.689 --> 13:36.222
Surveillance audio of Victoria Locke

13:36.224 --> 13:37.590
from her college days.

13:37.592 --> 13:39.325
Anti-government rant, fits the profile.

13:39.327 --> 13:41.260
But if she drowned in Malta in 2007,

13:41.262 --> 13:42.706
how can she be Krank?

13:42.708 --> 13:44.199
And the timing of Victoria's death

13:44.201 --> 13:46.539
tallies with when Krank
dropped off the bureau's radar.

13:46.541 --> 13:49.068
So, what? She came back from the dead?

13:49.070 --> 13:50.503
Maybe.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.005
Maybe?

13:58.546 --> 14:01.681
Damien Delaine's
the ultimate manipulator.

14:01.683 --> 14:06.552
Each move seems random and disconnected.

14:08.089 --> 14:09.989
Until it doesn't.

14:09.991 --> 14:11.758
He was in prison until a week ago.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.626
Could he really be behind this?

14:13.628 --> 14:15.395
But I spoke to his prison officers.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.096
His behavior was exemplary.

14:17.098 --> 14:18.564
Not even caught with a cellphone,

14:18.566 --> 14:19.914
let alone a computer.

14:19.916 --> 14:21.868
Still, one week out of prison,
and this happens?

14:21.870 --> 14:23.836
The timing is suspicious.

14:23.838 --> 14:25.790
Maybe he gave us
the name of a dead woman

14:25.817 --> 14:27.283
to throw us off the scent?

14:27.285 --> 14:29.118
All right, get our techs
to compare Krank's threats

14:29.120 --> 14:31.787
with our hack-tivists
operating the last 10 years.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.022
Let's see if we can find a match.

14:33.024 --> 14:34.423
Right away.

14:39.197 --> 14:40.763
Excuse me.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.334
Yeah.

14:57.548 --> 14:58.848
Maxine?

15:00.658 --> 15:02.151
Sorry, am I interrupting?

15:02.153 --> 15:04.186
No, it's okay.

15:05.490 --> 15:07.511
Listen, um...

15:10.061 --> 15:14.096
...a man died in your arms yesterday.

15:14.098 --> 15:16.999
No one would think any less of you if...

15:17.001 --> 15:19.702
if you wanted to sit this one out.

15:19.704 --> 15:21.103
I'm fine.

15:22.206 --> 15:23.572
Really.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.708
But thank you for asking.

15:33.284 --> 15:35.050
Okay, our techs found something.

15:35.052 --> 15:36.719
They're sending it through right now.

15:37.455 --> 15:39.321
Okay.

15:40.191 --> 15:41.457
What are we looking at?

15:41.459 --> 15:42.658
Online posts

15:42.660 --> 15:45.327
from someone calling themselves
"Tech Girl."

15:45.329 --> 15:46.829
Tech Girl?

15:46.831 --> 15:49.965
Victoria Locke went to
Chicago Institute of Technology.

15:49.967 --> 15:52.234
Her posts bear a remarkable
similarity to Krank's.

15:52.236 --> 15:54.506
What kind of similarities?

15:55.716 --> 15:59.241
Vocabulary, syntax, subject matter.

15:59.243 --> 16:02.411
Plus, Tech Girl appears
to have come into existence

16:02.413 --> 16:04.947
shortly after Victoria Locke
drowned in 2007.

16:04.949 --> 16:07.783
Or is said to have drowned.

16:07.785 --> 16:10.653
Faked her own death
and went underground.

16:10.655 --> 16:12.621
So, she's alive,

16:12.623 --> 16:14.824
and Damien Delaine's intel was helpful.

16:14.826 --> 16:16.341
So it appears, yeah.

16:17.123 --> 16:19.094
Can you pull a cellphone number
for Tech Girl?

16:19.096 --> 16:20.238
Yeah, I'm working on it.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.231
Oh, and I need something
to negotiate with.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.200
The NSA has authorized the release

16:24.202 --> 16:25.668
of certain packets of classified intel

16:25.670 --> 16:28.504
for leverage purposes.

16:28.506 --> 16:29.805
Packets containing...?

16:29.807 --> 16:31.207
Above my pay grade.

16:32.076 --> 16:33.909
Bingo. Got a contact number.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.212
All right, well, let's roll the dice.

16:36.214 --> 16:37.780
This better work.

16:37.782 --> 16:40.282
We've got 10 hours left.

16:47.625 --> 16:48.858
Hello?

16:48.860 --> 16:51.861
Am I speaking with Tech Girl?

16:51.863 --> 16:53.395
My name is Eric Beaumont.

16:53.397 --> 16:54.797
I'm a negotiator.

16:58.803 --> 17:00.603
Am I right in presuming

17:00.605 --> 17:03.005
you are Victoria Locke, a.k.a., Krank?

17:03.007 --> 17:05.374
<i>Darling, I'll be whoever
you want me to be.</i>

17:05.376 --> 17:06.675
Waveform is a match.

17:06.676 --> 17:07.810
I'll try to track her location.

17:07.811 --> 17:09.178
Victoria, I want you to know

17:09.180 --> 17:10.980
that I'm authorized
by the U.S. government

17:10.982 --> 17:12.615
to negotiate a deal with you.

17:12.617 --> 17:13.915
<i>Negotiate what?</i>

17:13.917 --> 17:15.917
I have all the power.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.088
And you want access to
classified government data.

17:19.089 --> 17:21.123
What do you plan to do with it?

17:21.125 --> 17:22.424
Release it to the world.

17:22.425 --> 17:24.126
<i>People need to know the truth...</i>

17:24.127 --> 17:25.728
how they're using terrorism

17:25.730 --> 17:28.097
as an excuse to spy on all of us.

17:28.098 --> 17:29.131
Well, wouldn't it hurt the people

17:29.133 --> 17:31.600
if terrorists were able to read

17:31.602 --> 17:33.736
the U.S. government's classified files?

17:34.972 --> 17:36.205
Tell me, Eric,

17:36.207 --> 17:38.207
do you know how many of the machines

17:38.209 --> 17:40.376
<i>that power our lives
are run by computer?</i>

17:40.840 --> 17:41.951
Most of them.

17:41.953 --> 17:43.846
<i>So you'll know to give me what I want,</i>

17:43.848 --> 17:46.415
or I will start

17:46.417 --> 17:49.551
by taking down
a few hospitals, an airport,

17:49.553 --> 17:52.717
and maybe I'll wipe out
part of the Eastern seaboard.

17:55.893 --> 17:58.427
Here's the thing I don't get.

17:58.429 --> 18:00.963
You're brilliant enough
to create this virus,

18:00.965 --> 18:02.798
but you need my help

18:02.800 --> 18:04.500
to access the government's secrets?

18:04.502 --> 18:06.669
The government use quantum encryption

18:06.671 --> 18:08.170
to protect their secrets...

18:08.172 --> 18:11.307
completely unhackable, even to me.

18:11.309 --> 18:14.410
So why target ordinary people?

18:14.412 --> 18:16.178
Why not attack the government?

18:16.180 --> 18:18.514
This precisely is
an attack on the government.

18:18.516 --> 18:20.716
For these people, these sheep,

18:20.718 --> 18:22.384
for them to realize
they're being oppressed,

18:22.386 --> 18:24.086
the only thing is to spill their blood.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.855
<i>The revolution will not begin</i>

18:26.857 --> 18:28.490
<i>until we hit the reset button,</i>

18:28.492 --> 18:30.025
<i>and that's where we're going...</i>

18:30.027 --> 18:31.026
<i>a revolution,</i>

18:31.028 --> 18:32.728
a total collapse of authority.

18:32.730 --> 18:34.463
Please trust me,
I'm gonna do everything I can

18:34.465 --> 18:35.564
to get you what you need.

18:35.566 --> 18:36.799
<i>Access codes by midnight,</i>

18:36.801 --> 18:38.767
or the bodies start piling up.

18:41.005 --> 18:43.505
I wasn't able to track her location.

18:48.112 --> 18:50.379
Shouldn't the FBI get Damien Delaine

18:50.381 --> 18:53.148
to start working on a way
to block her attack?

18:53.150 --> 18:54.450
Well, Woods is working on it.

18:54.452 --> 18:55.851
He doesn't need Delaine on this.

18:55.853 --> 18:58.387
But they don't know
this programming language,

18:58.389 --> 18:59.388
and they don't know her.

18:59.390 --> 19:00.789
He does.

19:02.259 --> 19:03.993
Look at Victoria's profile.

19:03.995 --> 19:05.494
She's A-1 critical,

19:05.496 --> 19:07.129
total conviction to the cause,

19:07.131 --> 19:09.565
comfortable with
substantial loss of life,

19:09.567 --> 19:12.267
slight hysteria,
possibly not sane of mind.

19:13.471 --> 19:14.803
Your point?

19:15.906 --> 19:18.240
She's not gonna budge, Eric.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.562
Not in 10 hours, and you know it.

19:21.479 --> 19:24.046
We need Delaine to give us
another way out.

19:24.048 --> 19:25.280
She's right.

19:27.718 --> 19:29.852
Delaine's an asset
we can't afford to lose.

19:29.854 --> 19:32.354
Delaine is not what he seems, Freddie.

19:32.356 --> 19:33.489
We both know that.

19:33.491 --> 19:35.157
And without him,

19:35.159 --> 19:37.259
we wouldn't have had our lead
to Victoria Locke.

19:39.630 --> 19:41.463
This is a game,

19:41.465 --> 19:43.365
and we are playing by his rules.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.334
Eric, I despise the son of a bitch

19:45.336 --> 19:46.301
as much as you do,

19:46.303 --> 19:47.736
but within 10 hours,

19:47.738 --> 19:49.471
she's gonna start killing people.

19:51.809 --> 19:54.476
[Computer beeps

19:54.478 --> 19:56.678
They've given Delaine
a high-speed computer.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.480
He's working on a way
to counteract the virus.

20:03.387 --> 20:04.720
Victoria, it's Eric.

20:04.722 --> 20:06.065
Do you have what I need?

20:06.986 --> 20:08.290
Sir, the techs have been able to use

20:08.292 --> 20:09.458
Beaumont's communication

20:09.460 --> 20:11.093
to pinpoint Victoria Locke's location.

20:11.447 --> 20:14.207
South D.C. Tactical Unit's
ready to take her out.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.032
I told Eric Beaumont

20:17.034 --> 20:19.234
I'd give him time to negotiate.

20:19.236 --> 20:20.602
Sir, with 10 hours left,

20:20.604 --> 20:23.839
I don't think anyone expects you
to hold to that promise.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.744
I don't have those access codes,
but I do have a gift.

20:28.746 --> 20:30.279
What's the gift?

20:30.281 --> 20:31.847
And she's on the hook.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.753
A terabyte of classified information.

20:37.755 --> 20:39.421
It's a show of good faith, Victoria,

20:39.423 --> 20:41.490
while I work on getting you the rest.

20:45.763 --> 20:47.896
<i>And here I was thinking
you wanted me to trust you.</i>

20:54.038 --> 20:56.105
I absolutely do.

20:56.107 --> 20:59.808
You people forget
surveillance works both ways.

21:05.216 --> 21:06.982
What the hell just happened?

21:06.984 --> 21:08.350
She's watching us.

21:14.325 --> 21:15.457
Not us.

21:16.594 --> 21:18.347
Let me see.

21:19.463 --> 21:20.729
Son of a...

21:36.358 --> 21:37.846
Freddie?!

21:38.605 --> 21:39.848
Eric!

21:39.850 --> 21:41.750
Freddie, I'm gonna get you out of there!

21:41.752 --> 21:43.519
What's wrong with the elevator?

21:47.324 --> 21:48.357
Aah.

21:48.359 --> 21:50.058
Somebody get an engineer!

21:52.796 --> 21:54.096
Son of a bitch.

22:19.987 --> 22:23.876
Right this way, right this way.

22:23.878 --> 22:26.692
Can you move aside, please?
We got get through here, okay?

22:29.763 --> 22:31.296
I got him. I got him right here.

22:31.298 --> 22:33.031
I got it all clear.

22:58.959 --> 23:00.258
Eric?

23:02.730 --> 23:04.696
Government techs have confirmed it.

23:04.698 --> 23:07.165
The same code that blew Nash's phone

23:07.167 --> 23:09.301
took over the elevator.

23:09.790 --> 23:11.156
Hey.

23:11.538 --> 23:13.217
I'm sorry.

23:14.074 --> 23:15.761
We grew apart...

23:17.211 --> 23:18.610
but he was my mentor.

23:18.612 --> 23:20.178
He was my friend.

23:20.180 --> 23:24.137
This isn't easy for us, uh, to say,

23:24.139 --> 23:26.618
but we both feel

23:26.620 --> 23:28.353
that you should recuse yourself.

23:28.355 --> 23:30.322
- I can't.
- Why?

23:30.324 --> 23:32.224
Because you think
Damien Delaine's behind this?

23:32.226 --> 23:33.592
He's behind everything.

23:33.594 --> 23:35.978
Killing Nash in front of Maxine,

23:35.980 --> 23:37.863
programming language
leading us right to him,

23:37.865 --> 23:38.804
and now Woods's death.

23:38.806 --> 23:42.167
Eric, Victoria Locke killed Woods.

23:42.169 --> 23:43.301
She's not even trying to hide it.

23:43.303 --> 23:46.104
I am telling you this is Delaine.

23:46.106 --> 23:49.875
Eric, we don't trust him, either,

23:49.877 --> 23:51.460
but you're too close to this.

23:51.462 --> 23:54.913
Maybe. But I'm not leaving.

23:54.915 --> 23:57.216
It's Victoria.

24:02.823 --> 24:04.823
_

24:06.543 --> 24:08.020
_

24:09.029 --> 24:11.335
Face to face... that's progress, right?

24:13.505 --> 24:14.599
It's a trap.

24:14.601 --> 24:16.434
Yeah, it sure is.

24:16.436 --> 24:17.981
Look, if you go, we all go.

24:17.983 --> 24:19.448
You saw what she said.

24:19.450 --> 24:20.505
Alone.

24:20.507 --> 24:22.040
I'll check in when I get there.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.675
The feds are gonna want to find me

24:23.677 --> 24:26.044
so they can take her out.

24:26.046 --> 24:27.279
Make sure they don't.

24:35.789 --> 24:37.088
Eric!

24:37.879 --> 24:40.186
Eric, I have to tell you something.

24:40.186 --> 24:41.955
No time, Maxine.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.422
I've been in contact
with Damien Delaine.

24:49.539 --> 24:51.296
I know I should have told you,

24:51.298 --> 24:53.231
and you have every right to fire me.

24:53.233 --> 24:54.799
How long?

24:55.228 --> 24:56.768
He started writing me letters and texts

24:56.770 --> 24:58.203
about a year ago.

24:58.838 --> 25:00.338
I ignored them at first, but...

25:01.108 --> 25:03.441
But I wanted him to tell me
more about my mom,

25:04.053 --> 25:07.403
and not just the sugar-coated
version my aunt fed me.

25:11.685 --> 25:15.253
What? You're not angry with me?

25:16.690 --> 25:18.539
What? You think I didn't know?

25:19.326 --> 25:21.926
From the moment I hired you.

25:22.996 --> 25:24.195
You knew.

25:24.197 --> 25:25.539
I know Delaine.

25:26.032 --> 25:27.599
He's been using you to get to me

25:27.601 --> 25:28.733
from the start.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.735
Because you arrested him?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.971
Eric, that was 17 years ago.

25:32.973 --> 25:35.073
I know you feel responsible
for my mother's death, but...

25:35.075 --> 25:37.141
I am responsible.

25:37.143 --> 25:39.611
Freddie Woods launched that assault.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.514
All those people died
before you went in to negotiate.

25:48.555 --> 25:51.260
What I'm about to tell you
is not in the public record,

25:51.725 --> 25:53.725
because I made sure of it.

25:56.029 --> 25:59.931
<i>I did enter to negotiate.</i>

26:04.113 --> 26:05.803
There were dead bodies everywhere.

26:09.376 --> 26:12.010
<i>Delaine saw me
but kept right on walking.</i>

26:26.893 --> 26:28.192
And then I saw her.

26:28.194 --> 26:30.152
I saw your mother.

26:30.154 --> 26:32.730
I saw Jessica...

26:33.266 --> 26:34.632
Now we are calm.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.168
Now we are ready.

26:37.170 --> 26:38.469
This is what we talked about.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.771
Jessica?

26:42.609 --> 26:45.176
I want you to turn on the switch.

26:45.178 --> 26:47.912
<i>...Wearing a suicide vest.</i>

26:49.315 --> 26:51.327
A suicide vest?

26:52.519 --> 26:55.355
Delaine was right behind her.

26:56.289 --> 26:58.289
I pleaded with her to surrender

26:58.291 --> 27:00.358
for the sake of the men, women,
and children

27:00.360 --> 27:02.760
still alive inside the compound,

27:02.762 --> 27:05.463
but she said he was in her head.

27:07.133 --> 27:08.800
She couldn't get him out.

27:10.970 --> 27:13.071
Please, Jessica, don't do this.

27:13.073 --> 27:14.906
She didn't want to die.

27:14.908 --> 27:18.142
She loved you so much, Maxine.

27:19.813 --> 27:22.880
<i>I had Freddie in my ear,
ordering me to take the shot.</i>

27:23.850 --> 27:26.284
Jessica had Delaine in hers,

27:26.286 --> 27:27.985
telling her she had to press the button.

27:27.987 --> 27:30.221
Push that button.

27:30.223 --> 27:32.017
I couldn't reach her.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.592
I tried...

27:35.888 --> 27:37.187
...and I failed.

27:38.131 --> 27:39.464
Push the button.

27:41.634 --> 27:43.835
Jessica.

27:56.483 --> 27:58.332
You shot her?

28:00.353 --> 28:01.719
I didn't want you growing up

28:01.721 --> 28:03.354
thinking your mother was a bad person.

28:03.356 --> 28:04.622
She wasn't.

28:07.127 --> 28:08.459
But Damien Delaine

28:08.852 --> 28:11.329
wanted to become a martyr that day,

28:11.331 --> 28:13.831
and he will never forgive me.

28:17.670 --> 28:18.936
Never.

28:36.222 --> 28:39.457
Mr. Delaine, tell me something good.

28:39.459 --> 28:41.459
I'm working on a way to stop Victoria.

28:41.461 --> 28:44.295
In truth, the code she's written
is beautifully simple.

28:44.297 --> 28:45.963
A couple of nuts left to crack.

28:45.965 --> 28:48.566
Six hours, maybe. You have four.

28:50.703 --> 28:52.069
Maxine.

28:52.071 --> 28:53.571
Hi, Damien.

28:53.573 --> 28:56.174
How wonderful to finally see your face.

28:57.544 --> 28:59.143
You two know each other?

28:59.145 --> 29:00.411
Eric told me everything.

29:01.848 --> 29:05.610
Has this all been about
using me to get to him?

29:06.352 --> 29:07.819
My dear...

29:08.507 --> 29:11.489
I will wager that Eric did not, in fact,

29:11.491 --> 29:12.657
tell you everything.

29:12.659 --> 29:14.725
But right now, I have work to do.

29:14.727 --> 29:16.460
What didn't he tell me?

29:16.462 --> 29:18.462
Given he's a type-A control freak

29:18.464 --> 29:21.199
with a narcissistic
personality disorder,

29:21.201 --> 29:22.300
I'm sure he didn't mention

29:22.302 --> 29:24.569
the strings he's pulled all your life.

29:24.571 --> 29:26.003
What strings?

29:26.005 --> 29:28.940
The insurance payout
from Jessica's death,

29:28.942 --> 29:31.008
the scholarship to Northwestern.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.077
- You don't have to listen to this.
- Yes, I do.

29:33.079 --> 29:34.312
Why would he do that?

29:34.314 --> 29:36.747
Because he was in love
with your mother, of course.

29:38.484 --> 29:39.517
What?

29:39.519 --> 29:40.451
He's lying.

29:40.453 --> 29:42.420
Check my waveform, Mr. Yates.

29:42.422 --> 29:44.021
You will see that I am not.

29:44.023 --> 29:46.490
Eric and Jessica
had an affair for years,

29:46.492 --> 29:47.859
way before I met her.

29:47.861 --> 29:49.026
Okay, we're hanging up now.

29:49.028 --> 29:51.462
Do it, if the truth offends you.

29:52.498 --> 29:55.533
The real reason Eric shot your mother

29:55.535 --> 29:57.481
is because she left him...

29:57.971 --> 29:58.803
for me.

30:02.442 --> 30:05.343
- Can we track Eric's location?
- Yeah.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.544
Then let's go.

30:06.546 --> 30:08.346
- What about Delaine?
- I'm not waiting for him.

31:54.004 --> 31:55.503
All right, I just lost Eric's signal

31:55.505 --> 31:57.705
about 20 miles outside Bethesda.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.174
Where do you think she's led him?

31:59.176 --> 32:00.708
If she's planning on going through this,

32:00.710 --> 32:02.410
- it could be a data bunker.
- A data bunker?

32:02.412 --> 32:04.412
Where critical infrastructure
is controlled?

32:04.414 --> 32:05.613
She'd need direct access.

32:05.615 --> 32:07.415
Yeah, it's not the kind of place
you find on a map.

32:07.417 --> 32:08.850
And it would be protected, wouldn't it?

32:08.852 --> 32:10.585
She wouldn't be able
to get past the armed guards.

32:10.587 --> 32:12.220
Well, maybe she could.

32:16.010 --> 32:18.460
Don't worry.

32:18.462 --> 32:20.128
I've returned the carbon monoxide levels

32:20.130 --> 32:21.529
to normal.

32:21.531 --> 32:23.331
Have you got my codes?

32:23.333 --> 32:25.433
I don't think that's really
what you need.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.371
Please, stay back.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.376
Give me what I want, or I will do it.

32:36.947 --> 32:38.446
Traffic signals...

32:40.650 --> 32:42.083
...Life-support systems...

32:42.085 --> 32:44.085
Air traffic control.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.787
The whole country
will come crashing down

32:45.789 --> 32:47.355
in blood and chaos.

32:47.357 --> 32:50.291
You do not want to do this.

32:50.818 --> 32:52.360
You're wrong.

32:52.362 --> 32:54.329
One more step, and I will prove it.

33:06.142 --> 33:08.009
You swore you would never
pick up a gun again

33:08.011 --> 33:10.745
after you killed Jessica Ford.

33:13.483 --> 33:15.350
You want me to pick
up the gun, is that it?

33:19.589 --> 33:21.356
And what would you do

33:21.358 --> 33:24.257
to save all these lives, Eric?

33:25.228 --> 33:26.394
Take mine?

33:30.901 --> 33:32.567
Okay.

33:32.569 --> 33:34.536
What do the FBI say?

33:34.538 --> 33:36.938
- Any update on Delaine?
- Not exactly.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.873
He's disappeared.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.642
What do you mean "disappeared"?

33:40.644 --> 33:42.310
The FBI went to track his progress.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.978
He's vanished.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.180
So now we have no way of stopping Krank.

33:46.182 --> 33:48.550
This was never about stopping Krank

33:48.552 --> 33:50.051
or government secrets.

33:50.053 --> 33:52.220
I think Delaine's
been controlling Victoria,

33:52.222 --> 33:54.155
perhaps ever since he was her professor,

33:54.157 --> 33:56.257
probably even arranged
the faking of her death

33:56.259 --> 33:57.959
to one day activate her for this.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.662
Eric was right.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.665
This was about destroying him and me.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.832
Maxine, you don't believe

34:04.834 --> 34:06.434
what Delaine was saying back there?

34:06.436 --> 34:07.902
I believe everything he said.

34:07.904 --> 34:09.070
Think about it.

34:09.072 --> 34:10.737
If Delaine knew all that about me,

34:10.739 --> 34:12.473
then he also knew I studied Latin,

34:12.475 --> 34:15.275
that I would recognize
that phrase yesterday morning,

34:15.277 --> 34:17.512
just too late
to save that man from dying.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.213
Why would he want that?

34:19.215 --> 34:21.983
To shake her faith in Eric and herself,

34:21.985 --> 34:23.717
get her to turn against him.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.521
This is where Eric's
cellphone signal cut out.

34:35.799 --> 34:38.699
- I'm going in. You should call the FBI.
- No.

34:39.902 --> 34:41.402
We're going with you.

34:44.808 --> 34:48.775
Victoria, I do not want to shoot you.

34:48.777 --> 34:50.244
You don't have a choice.

34:50.246 --> 34:51.612
Delaine has gotten into your head,

34:51.614 --> 34:52.880
just like he got into Jessica's,

34:52.882 --> 34:54.983
but you do not have to die.

34:54.985 --> 34:57.675
An awful lot of people will unless I do.

35:01.658 --> 35:02.657
Damn it.

35:06.896 --> 35:09.764
Please, stop.

35:09.766 --> 35:11.599
I can't do that, Eric,

35:11.601 --> 35:13.101
but you can.

35:16.773 --> 35:18.406
Eric, wait.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.453
It's true, isn't it?

35:24.247 --> 35:26.614
You were in love with my mother.

35:30.787 --> 35:32.020
Yes, I was.

35:32.022 --> 35:33.955
But that's not why you shot her.

35:34.943 --> 35:36.566
Victoria, stop.

35:37.127 --> 35:39.293
This is not the time for
this conversation, Maxine.

35:39.295 --> 35:40.762
He's right, Maxine.

35:42.032 --> 35:43.464
This is ready to go.

35:43.466 --> 35:45.199
In just a few seconds,

35:45.201 --> 35:47.391
tens of thousands of people will die.

35:48.639 --> 35:50.206
She's wrong, Eric.

35:50.208 --> 35:51.373
Oh, is it Delaine's fix?

35:51.375 --> 35:52.575
He's disappeared.

35:52.577 --> 35:54.577
Because she can't do
what she thinks she can do.

35:55.632 --> 35:57.446
She blew up that cellphone,

35:57.448 --> 35:59.281
sent Freddie Woods
plunging to his death.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.784
Designed by Delaine to make you believe,

36:01.786 --> 36:03.425
to make all of us believe,

36:03.856 --> 36:05.788
the virus could infiltrate any system.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.323
It was all a bluff.

36:07.325 --> 36:09.024
You don't know that.

36:09.026 --> 36:10.991
You said it yourself.

36:12.163 --> 36:14.330
Damien Delaine is a game player.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.465
This has all been part of his game.

36:18.503 --> 36:20.736
To re-create Shiloh,

36:20.738 --> 36:22.271
to take revenge by pushing you to do

36:22.273 --> 36:25.574
the one thing you swore
you would never do.

36:25.576 --> 36:28.558
The only thing
he didn't count on was us.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.881
Put the gun down, Eric.

36:31.883 --> 36:33.582
Nothing will happen.

36:34.015 --> 36:35.551
And if you're wrong?

36:35.553 --> 36:38.294
Then we are all wrong together.

36:38.823 --> 36:42.291
Eric, if you're looking for forgiveness

36:42.293 --> 36:44.195
for my mother's death,

36:44.862 --> 36:46.161
you have it.

36:47.398 --> 36:49.727
I know you didn't have a choice.

36:50.968 --> 36:52.668
But you do now.

36:54.539 --> 36:56.405
Time's up.

36:56.407 --> 36:59.775
Eric, please.

37:01.546 --> 37:02.811
Eric, please.

37:09.954 --> 37:11.921
Say good night.

37:22.567 --> 37:23.532
No.

37:30.107 --> 37:31.140
I'm...

37:31.142 --> 37:32.965
No.

37:32.967 --> 37:34.476
No!

37:34.979 --> 37:36.545
No!

37:41.986 --> 37:44.920
- No.
- It's over, Victoria.

37:44.922 --> 37:46.884
No!

37:48.459 --> 37:50.359
No, no, no, no, no.
this can't be happening!

37:50.361 --> 37:52.374
- Wait! No, no.
- It's okay.

37:52.376 --> 37:53.862
No, no!

37:53.864 --> 37:54.863
No.

37:54.865 --> 37:57.099
Ugh.

38:38.776 --> 38:40.809
She'll face charges
for the deaths of Nash,

38:40.811 --> 38:43.767
Freddie Woods,
and everyone she killed here.

38:44.575 --> 38:45.708
How you doing?

38:46.743 --> 38:48.276
You were right.

38:49.292 --> 38:52.121
Emotions are dangerous.

38:53.275 --> 38:55.224
Well, one thing I wasn't right about

38:55.226 --> 38:59.261
was, uh... you.

39:00.931 --> 39:03.632
Maxine, you belong on this team.

39:05.369 --> 39:06.802
I'm not so sure about that.

39:20.451 --> 39:22.518
I kept this picture of your mother

39:22.520 --> 39:24.453
in my wallet for 17 years.

39:25.523 --> 39:27.022
I think you should have it now.

39:34.265 --> 39:36.845
All the doors that opened in my life...

39:37.735 --> 39:39.831
nothing is what I thought.

39:40.538 --> 39:41.503
I didn't open any doors

39:41.505 --> 39:42.971
you couldn't walk through on your own.

39:42.973 --> 39:46.884
I just had to make sure you were okay.

39:47.845 --> 39:49.278
Out of guilt?

39:50.748 --> 39:52.338
No.

39:54.151 --> 39:55.350
Out of love.

39:57.521 --> 39:58.887
Your mother couldn't take care of you,

39:58.889 --> 40:00.556
so I did.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.760
I always knew one day,

40:04.762 --> 40:06.695
the door you'd walk through
would be mine.

40:11.435 --> 40:13.368
I don't think I can stay here anymore.

40:16.474 --> 40:18.006
This isn't over, Maxine.

40:18.008 --> 40:19.652
It <i> is</i> over.

40:20.578 --> 40:22.111
You didn't pull the trigger.

40:22.113 --> 40:23.245
Delaine lost.

40:23.247 --> 40:24.747
He's not gonna accept defeat.

40:26.450 --> 40:29.340
He will keep after me, and you,

40:29.820 --> 40:31.620
until he's destroyed us both.

40:34.258 --> 40:35.624
- Nathalie?
- Eric.

40:35.626 --> 40:36.925
Nathalie, what's wrong?

40:36.927 --> 40:40.662
Oh, I put Evie on the plane
back to Montreal myself, Eric.

40:40.664 --> 40:42.881
The driver's waiting at Arrivals.

40:42.883 --> 40:44.500
She never showed.

40:44.502 --> 40:45.868
I've been calling and calling.

40:47.138 --> 40:49.638
I know something's wrong, Eric.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.206
I know it.

40:53.850 --> 40:54.715
So...

40:54.945 --> 40:56.445
Eric, answer me.

40:56.447 --> 40:57.479
Eric.

40:57.481 --> 40:58.747
What is it?

40:58.749 --> 40:59.882
Answer me.

40:59.884 --> 41:02.084
Eric, what's happening?

41:02.086 --> 41:04.753
Delaine's taken my daughter.
