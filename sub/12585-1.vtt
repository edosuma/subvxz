WEBVTT

00:34.492 --> 00:37.245
My very first clothing exchange.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.582
I've never felt so cosmopolitan.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.626
That's a word I learned in a bar.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.378
So the magazine says

00:45.462 --> 00:47.213
we each present an item of clothing,

00:47.297 --> 00:49.549
and the first one to call dibs gets it.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.551
Oh, like a key party.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.055
Or so I've heard.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.348
Okay, these boots I only wore once,

00:57.432 --> 00:58.933
and then I stopped wearing maroon.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.018
Dibs!

01:00.101 --> 01:01.728
These are adorable!

01:01.811 --> 01:03.354
I have the perfect outfit for...

01:06.858 --> 01:08.401
Oh, right.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.612
Dibs! I want to try them!

01:14.699 --> 01:17.035
-Oh! They're cute on you.
-Oh. Perfect!

01:17.118 --> 01:18.912
Yay!

01:18.995 --> 01:20.955
Okay, everybody, my turn.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.583
How about these?

01:23.666 --> 01:24.542
They're functional.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.878
They can go straight from a PTA meeting

01:26.961 --> 01:28.922
to a sexy night on the town.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.925
Aunt Peggy, culottes aren't cool.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.052
Even though it sounds like they should be.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.097
Oh, shug, surely someone
will want these...

01:37.180 --> 01:38.473
overalls.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.777
So how was your clothes exchange?

01:51.277 --> 01:54.614
I bet Nancy liked
that old softball jersey of yours.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.698
As it turns out,

01:55.782 --> 01:58.785
Nancy would rather have a pair
of men's dirty flip-flops

01:58.868 --> 02:00.578
than my softball jersey.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.914
Apparently, it wasn't feminine enough.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.667
You think I'm feminine, don't you, Hank?

02:05.750 --> 02:06.918
Well, sure you are.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.670
You're a wife and a mother.

02:08.753 --> 02:09.921
Yeah, there's that.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.758
I just felt so ungainly
compared to those women.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.177
Why don't you call
your shoe store in Lubbock?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.304
I'm treating you to some new shoes.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.764
Thank you, Hank.

02:19.848 --> 02:20.890
And, by the way,

02:20.974 --> 02:22.392
you're wearing my jeans again.

02:27.063 --> 02:30.191
This is the greatest book I've ever read.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.318
Wow, <i>Dr. Prankenstein</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:33.987
<i>has a degree in "Hee"</i>

02:34.070 --> 02:35.572
<i>with a minor in "Ha."</i>

02:35.655 --> 02:38.741
Joseph, have you seen
my lucky switchblade comb?

02:38.825 --> 02:40.410
I already told you!

02:40.493 --> 02:42.036
I broke it!

02:43.037 --> 02:44.289
Ah, you're right.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.291
Sorry I snapped at you, Joseph.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.960
See, there's going to be a coup
today at the gun club,

02:49.043 --> 02:51.129
and I may become the new president

02:51.212 --> 02:53.965
if I can get over these pre-coup jitters.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.679
Mr. Gribble, I know
what would help you relax.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.057
How would you like a 25-cent massage?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.350
Who wouldn't?

03:05.977 --> 03:07.520
Here you go, Mr. Gribble.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.857
One 25-cent massage coming up.

03:11.316 --> 03:15.028
You just roll this gently
all over your face.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.491
Wow, this is fantastic, Bobby.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.372
This is as relaxing as smoking used to be.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.708
Well, off to my coup.

03:28.791 --> 03:32.295
We got to go watch this.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.089
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hello, Lubbock's Very Big Shoes.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.341
Guess what I'm calling about?

03:36.424 --> 03:38.760
<i> Sorry, Lady.
the shoe store went out of business.</i>

03:38.843 --> 03:40.011
<i>We're a dog bakery now.</i>

03:43.848 --> 03:45.934
Aunt Peggy! Look what I got.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.143
A bracelet.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.104
It's what some women wear on their wrists.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.399
It's like jewelry.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.860
Yes, Luanne, I know what a bracelet is.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.504
Hello, do you have a pump in a size... 16?

04:14.587 --> 04:16.047
Which brand?

04:19.592 --> 04:20.843
Oh, my God.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.304
Wedges?

04:24.138 --> 04:25.098
Sandals?

04:25.890 --> 04:27.016
These boots...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.476
they're just like Nancy's.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.437
It's too big.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.982
<i>Okay.</i>

04:34.065 --> 04:35.733
Phase one of the coup is under way.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.653
Spiro's safely locked and secure
in the snack closet.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.196
It's time to pick our new leader.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.657
Our short list is
Earl Boley and Dale Gribble.

04:42.740 --> 04:43.741
Where's Dale?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.910
-Coward didn't show.
-All right,

04:45.994 --> 04:47.787
looks like you're our new president, Earl.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.041
Hey, guys.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.626
I think he's wearing war paint.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.628
I'm with Dale.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.130
Me, too. Give me that pen!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.800
I don't get it.
They're not laughing at him.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.177
I say we make Gribble
the new president.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.513
All in favor, fire once into the ground.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.267
Maybe we didn't do it right.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.276
How much do you love zebra print?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.277
Okay.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.779
You know how
when you see a really cute baby,

05:21.863 --> 05:23.448
and you just want to eat it?

05:23.531 --> 05:25.867
That is how I feel about these shoes.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.327
Oh, here, you take it.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.703
Oh, thank you.

05:28.786 --> 05:29.746
Peggy.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.913
Carolyn.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.041
I usually hear this, not say it...

05:33.124 --> 05:34.042
nice grip.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.590
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.883
Who are you talking to?

05:41.966 --> 05:42.925
Different people.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.179
I wanna see my new clothes in action
before I commit to owning them.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.432
It's a technique I learned
from this interesting woman I met today.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.352
Her name is Carolyn, and she wears gloves.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.478
Gloves?

05:53.561 --> 05:55.730
Huh, that is interesting.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.733
I felt this instant sense
of camaraderie with her

05:58.816 --> 06:00.860
that I don't normally find
with other women.

06:00.985 --> 06:04.530
So you've got someone to talk to
about this stuff now?

06:04.614 --> 06:05.907
That's great.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.283
Yes, it is, Hank.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.329
Taxi!

06:12.872 --> 06:13.748
<i>Hmm!</i>

06:13.831 --> 06:16.209
This chicken curry is delicious.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.921
I could understand why it is one
of Oprah's favorite sandwiches.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.256
Peggy, you ate that whole sandwich.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.093
Yes, yes, I did.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.345
I'm sorry. That was very unladylike.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.098
And none of your lipstick
smeared or came off at all.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.391
How do you do that?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.226
Well, just before biting,

06:33.309 --> 06:36.396
I move the teeth forward
and slide the lip up.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.855
I'll show you in slow-mo.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.029
It works!

06:45.113 --> 06:46.614
This is going to be a lifesaver.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.200
See, I do this song
and dance act on the weekends,

06:49.283 --> 06:51.244
and I need to be able
to snack between sets,

06:51.327 --> 06:53.746
so I don't pass out during
the particularly emotional numbers.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.705
Thank you, Peggy.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.790
I got the idea

06:55.873 --> 06:58.251
from watching <i>Shark Attacks</i>
on the Nature Channel,

06:58.334 --> 07:01.212
or a Bette Davis movie. I can't remember.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.801
I don't know why everyone doesn't drive
with their high beams on.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.010
You see so much better.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.595
So, the glasses.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.722
Are you afraid of the laser surgery, too?

07:11.806 --> 07:14.058
'Cause the closest I wanna get
to a laser is front row

07:14.142 --> 07:15.184
at a Chaka Khan concert.

07:15.309 --> 07:19.313
Actually, the glasses hide thin brows,
fine lines, and wrinkles.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.233
People do not say it,
but they make me look ten years younger.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.484
True that.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.075
Oh, Carolyn, if there wasn't
a parking brake between us,

07:31.159 --> 07:32.743
I'd think we were connected at the hip.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.580
Oh, my God, the parking brake's on.

07:37.832 --> 07:38.791
Ooh.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.918
I helped myself to some tea.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.628
Hey, Mom. Sorry, I'm late.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.882
Do not apologize for yourself,
now or ever.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.426
I love the new wig, son. Gorgeous.

07:48.551 --> 07:52.263
Thanks. I just had the best time
with this new girl, Peggy Hill.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.224
I don't know what his real name is.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.268
Nancy, it's Peggy.

07:57.351 --> 08:01.105
I can't go shopping with you tomorrow.
I'm hanging out with my new gal pal.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.192
I should call Minh, too.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.412
Ahh, it's so nice to have a friend

08:16.496 --> 08:18.706
who's strong enough
to push her way through a sale.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.043
Nancy always fell somewhere
between lingerie and handbags.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.337
Some of my friends are
too scared to go to the mall.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.755
They buy everything online.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.718
Thank goodness I hid all
the good stuff last week.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.513
Tah-dah.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.225
I love it. I have
to wear scarves in the show.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.936
So, what do you do in your act?

08:40.019 --> 08:42.980
Well, I don't do any one artist
like some of the girls do.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.900
A little Liza, Barbra, Celine.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.193
My favorites.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.447
You really know how to work a scarf.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.784
Hey, I've always wanted
to do a duet in the show.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.536
You and me, Peggy. What do you say?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.287
-Yes.
-Great!

08:58.371 --> 08:59.747
Just bring your own eyelashes.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.040
I always do.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.796
-<i>♪ I'm every woman ♪</i>
-And one more time.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.049
<i>♪ It's all in me ♪</i>

09:10.132 --> 09:11.467
<i>♪ Anything you want done, baby ♪</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:13.094
Now don't be afraid
to move your head a little

09:13.177 --> 09:14.178
during the humming part,

09:14.262 --> 09:16.180
so people will know
you're pretending to hum.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.223
Mm-hmm.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.644
<i>♪ I'm every woman ♪</i>

09:21.727 --> 09:22.979
<i>♪ It's all in me... ♪</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:25.022
Hi, Hank! Stand back.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.899
-We're kickin'!
-Okay, then.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.485
<i>♪ Every one from A to Z ♪</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:32.196
<i>♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa... ♪</i>

09:32.655 --> 09:35.324
Oh. Carolyn, this is my husband, Hank.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.159
Nice to meet you, Carolyn.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.411
Carolyn.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.912
I always liked that name.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.455
I thought it was a good one.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.457
Well, I'll get out of your way, ladies.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.712
Bobby, this is my new friend, Carolyn.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.672
Carolyn, my son, Bobby.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.881
Hey.

09:50.965 --> 09:51.966
Oh.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.594
So, did you two adopt?

09:54.677 --> 09:57.513
No, ma'am, and I have
the stretch marks to prove it.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.681
Stretch marks?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.391
Nothing seems to diminish them.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.310
Not shea butter, not cow placenta,

10:02.393 --> 10:03.769
not goat placenta.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.021
Really?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.522
Mm-hmm, oh, yeah.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.107
I imagine this is what it looks like

10:08.190 --> 10:10.860
when you're stabbed in the stomach
at several different angles, huh?

10:12.028 --> 10:13.571
Uh, yeah, stabbing.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.324
Could I have another drink, please?

10:21.996 --> 10:25.124
Mm. Oh, some string. Oh! A dollar!

10:26.167 --> 10:27.168
What the...

10:30.254 --> 10:31.464
Damn wind.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.798
Pull the string again.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.343
Mr. Dauterive really cares about money.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.803
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go? Oh, I see!

10:37.887 --> 10:41.015
Oh, there it is. Oh! Oh, darn it.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.609
Oh, my God!

10:51.692 --> 10:53.527
Are you okay?

10:55.321 --> 10:58.532
I'm doing better now, sweet cheeks.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.785
I never seen eyes so dilated.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.287
I could lose myself in them.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.873
You know, I really shouldn't be driving.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.167
-You wanna take the wheel?
-Sure.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.338
Did you see his face?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.340
Yeah, he was happy.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.758
I know!

11:15.841 --> 11:17.843
What kind of joke book is this?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.639
Mom, I need to talk to you.
It's about Peggy.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.224
What's "her" problem?

11:23.307 --> 11:25.434
Mom, she's a real woman, and...

11:25.518 --> 11:27.812
You mean a biological woman.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.857
Just because you were born a male
doesn't make you any less of a woman.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.235
Let no one clip your wings, baby.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.113
Could you stop being supportive
for one second and listen?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.699
I've got a problem.
I can't let a real woman perform with me.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.866
It's a drag show.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.660
Do what you need to do.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.830
As long as there is
no shame involved, hear me?

11:45.913 --> 11:47.081
You're a person!

11:47.164 --> 11:48.541
Oh, Mother.

11:54.046 --> 11:54.880
Peggy,

11:54.964 --> 11:57.007
you almost forgot this thing.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.928
I'll be in the front row.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.806
Yeah, that might not be such a good idea.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.226
Apparently, they single out
newcomers and embarrass them.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.811
You know, like at church.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.897
Well, I'll be in the back
by the soundboard then.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.816
That outfit,

12:13.899 --> 12:15.818
it's very becoming.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.405
Looking good, shug.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.532
Yeah! Big hair kind of works for you.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.950
Where you going all dolled up?

12:23.033 --> 12:26.328
Well, I'm on my way to perform
with my new friend, Carolyn,

12:26.412 --> 12:27.955
in a glamorous revue.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.540
Would you both like to come?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.625
Wow. Five-drink minimum.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.920
Yes, and I would prefer it
if you didn't get drunk and embarrass me.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.839
We'll see you there. Break a leg!

12:36.922 --> 12:38.048
Yeah, whatever.

12:46.724 --> 12:51.353
What does it mean if instead of a purse,
a woman carries a tattered grocery bag?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.695
Uh, hey.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.613
Hello.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.198
Is Peggy here?

13:02.281 --> 13:05.868
Uh, no, she's not.
Uh, can I help you? I'm her husband.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.412
I'm Jamie. Uh, I know Carolyn.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.581
We're friends. Close friends.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.958
Oh. Well, that Carolyn is great.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.462
She's quite a catch there, Jamie.
What do you say to a beer?

13:20.299 --> 13:23.010
I say, "Where have you been all morning?"

13:23.093 --> 13:24.512
Good one!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.430
Yeah, I'll have to remember that one.

13:29.266 --> 13:33.229
So, Carolyn needs me
to find Peggy before the show.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.438
When do you expect her back?

13:34.522 --> 13:37.024
Well, she had to get something
for her costume.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.735
She called it a sequin emergency.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.863
I asked her to call it
something else, but she refused.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.657
Then she's going right to the club.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.408
I'll just, uh, catch her there.

13:47.117 --> 13:47.952
Bye, guys.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.500
I like nice people.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.255
Show time!

14:07.847 --> 14:10.140
If she wasn't dead,
I'd swear you were the real thing.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.936
-Peggy.
-That Diana Ross looks freaking amazing.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.106
We are going to have to pretend
sing our hearts out to outshine her.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.483
Honey, we can't do the routine.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.110
I have something to tell you.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.361
What, what is it?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.408
Peggy, I'm a drag queen.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.328
But I thought most drag queens were men.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.621
I am a man.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.249
I'd take off my wig to show you,
but it's too close to curtain.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.089
So then, I don't understand
why you invited me

14:42.172 --> 14:44.049
to do this show with you
in the first place...

14:44.967 --> 14:46.051
Oh, my God.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.512
You thought I was a man?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.599
We have the same size feet,
and you were shopping at The Closet.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.309
It's a store for drag queens, Peggy.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.603
I, I didn't know.

14:57.396 --> 15:01.025
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I thought you were the best I'd ever seen.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.067
It doesn't!

15:02.693 --> 15:04.278
-Hey, shug! Here we are!
-Surprise!

15:04.361 --> 15:05.404
What kind of place is this?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.837
Come on, Peggy Hill. Open the door!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.297
We're here to comfort you.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.884
Sorry everybody thinks
you're a man, Aunt Peggy.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.178
You know how everybody is.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.888
Go away!

15:30.971 --> 15:33.807
Shug, you coached
a women's softball league.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.226
If that's not feminine,
I don't know what is.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.979
We're trying to cheer her up,
not tick her off.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.606
You wanna get punched in the face?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.067
That woman's got fists
like frozen turkeys.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.527
I could still hear you, you know.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.367
Don't answer it.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.787
Well, Peggy, that's like telling a lie.
You just don't do that.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.956
Fine. Then I'm not here.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.667
But that's also a lie.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.460
Hill residence.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.879
Uh, she's not here.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.756
Okay, Carolyn.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.257
Dang it.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.009
Did she think you were me?

16:09.093 --> 16:11.470
I do sound like a man, apparently.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.763
What are you talking about?

16:12.888 --> 16:17.893
Carolyn, my friend, is really a man
who dresses up like a woman.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.436
Now, now hold on.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.146
That, that doesn't make any sense.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.358
And he thought that
I was also a man dressed as a woman.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.442
But I am not.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.945
I am a woman who looks like a man.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.822
What? No, you're not.

16:29.905 --> 16:33.659
Then why is it that the only woman
I can relate to is a man?

16:34.451 --> 16:38.038
And here I was feeling feminine
for the first time in my life.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.375
I have never felt so ugly!

16:41.458 --> 16:44.712
Uh... isn't this something
you should be talking about

16:44.795 --> 16:46.588
with your girlfriends?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.632
You know, like that Carolyn.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.218
Hank, are you even listening to me?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.268
Everybody's not...

17:02.896 --> 17:06.400
Hello, Carolyn.
I was calling to get Jamie's number.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.736
Oh, he is? Oh, that'd be great.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.487
Hello, Jamie.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.073
Can I take your order?

17:13.157 --> 17:17.036
Uh, I'll have
a normal orange juice, please.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.495
Uh. Make it normal.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.164
Okay, and which nutrient booster?

17:20.289 --> 17:23.000
Uh, no, no, I won't be
needing any more nutrients.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.752
I'm having a steak later.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.795
Thanks for meeting me.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.005
Uh... I have to talk to you

17:28.088 --> 17:31.383
about something that
I can't talk about with the guys.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.551
Sure, Hank, shoot.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.304
Well, my wife is really upset.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.307
I think maybe she and Carolyn
had a fight or something.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.060
I don't know.
Has Carolyn talked to you about this?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.854
She has. And believe me, she adores Peggy.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.106
She thinks she's a model of femininity.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.026
Actually, she wishes
she could be more like her.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.320
Well, Carolyn's one
of the best girlfriends

17:51.403 --> 17:52.821
Peggy has ever had.

17:52.905 --> 17:57.117
You think maybe you could talk to Carolyn,
see if they can't patch things up?

17:57.201 --> 17:59.203
Yes, she'll take care of this.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.497
Women need to work out
their problems emotionally.

18:01.580 --> 18:06.001
Boy, I've got to hand it to you, Jamie.
You sure do know a lot about women.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.512
Oh, shoot.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.099
Sorry your food is ruined.
We've got pizza.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.935
My mom just got me a credit card,
so we went crazy.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.520
Wow, thanks.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.191
This book stinks!

18:29.274 --> 18:33.612
You know, dude, every time you do a prank,
something good happens.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.072
That's a magic book!

18:35.447 --> 18:37.199
I don't know.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.451
I do. You've got to prank me, dude.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.953
Oh, okay.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.664
Make me rich and handsome.

18:43.747 --> 18:49.086
If your hand is bigger than your face,
all your wishes will come true.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.045
Cool.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.296
Ow!

18:53.132 --> 18:55.092
So, am I handsome?

19:03.016 --> 19:06.520
Oh, hello. Peggy, it's Carolyn.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.522
Peggy, stop right there.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.732
What do you want?

19:10.816 --> 19:12.818
I want you to drop
that sad blanket and come with me.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.111
I need to show you something.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.947
Will I be humiliated in any way?

19:17.030 --> 19:20.951
I swear on my mother's unwavering support
that you will not.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.663
Uh, Peggy, I don't like
to butt into your affairs,

19:24.746 --> 19:26.373
but you should go with her.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.878
Whatever you've been going through,
well, I think Carolyn can help.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.593
Fine. I will get my purse.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.928
And grab your trash bag full of clothes.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.972
-Hurry!
-Why?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.432
It's just more dramatic.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.941
Have a seat, Peggy.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.735
Girls, this is Peggy Hill.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.820
She is the one responsible
for that great tip

19:56.904 --> 19:59.156
about the lipstick and the one
about the glasses.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.575
Look at me. I'm a girl again.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.785
Thank you.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.454
You're welcome.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.872
No, wait. I...

20:08.790 --> 20:10.834
Is this what I think it is?

20:10.918 --> 20:13.045
A denim vest with appliqués on it?

20:13.128 --> 20:17.174
Oh, I want that.
It's so Mandrell Sisters Variety Hour!

20:17.257 --> 20:20.093
Mm-hmm, I had a feeling
your stuff would go quickly here.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.346
So this is why you brought me here?

20:22.429 --> 20:25.224
To show me that a bunch
of men want my clothes?

20:25.307 --> 20:28.727
A bunch of men who want to look
like women want your clothes.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.978
Uh-huh.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.940
But, come on, aren't you
all more impressed by women

20:33.023 --> 20:35.776
who are fancier and daintier and girlier?

20:35.859 --> 20:39.029
Honey, wispy women are a dime a dozen.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.657
-You said it, girl.
-Yeah, baby.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.701
Peggy, drag queens model
themselves after strong,

20:44.785 --> 20:46.536
substantial, fearless women,

20:46.620 --> 20:48.997
women who aren't afraid
to wear purple gauchos

20:49.081 --> 20:50.374
and MC Hammer glasses,

20:50.457 --> 20:53.335
women who only need one name
to describe themselves,

20:53.418 --> 20:56.171
-like Liza, Barbra and Cher.
-Hm.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.674
You, my dear, are simply Peggy.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.259
Peggy.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.094
That does make sense.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.221
Girl, you are fierce.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.347
Deal with it.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.603
I have got to have
these platform sneakers.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.146
They are yours.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.777
<i>Okay, who's hoarding</i>
<i>the turtlenecks?</i>

21:18.860 --> 21:20.237
<i>I know you've got them!</i>

21:53.312 --> 21:54.479
<i>Let no one</i>

21:54.563 --> 21:55.897
<i>clip your wings, baby.</i>
