00:19.394 --> 00:22.147
<i>For centuries, millennia even,</i>

00:23.231 --> 00:25.400
<i>female sexuality has been seen</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:29.154
<i>as one of the most dangerous forces
in the universe.</i>

00:30.196 --> 00:33.450
<i>Something that needs
to be controlled physically,</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:37.245
<i>legally, psychically.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:44.502
<i>All the way back to the Garden of Eden

00:54.095 --> 00:56.181

00:56.723 --> 01:00.894

Cooper.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.787
Are you the wife?

02:02.747 --> 02:03.581
Ye-- Yes.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.834
Mr. Connelly
has already been read his rights.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.337
He'll be transported to the station
where he'll be booked and kept in lockup

02:09.337 --> 02:11.422
until, and unless bail can be posted.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.091
Any questions?

02:14.592 --> 02:16.427
I'll follow you to the station.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.223
Hey, are you okay?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.018
Um...

03:07.687 --> 03:08.605
This is Cooper.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.232
This is Majid.

03:20.116 --> 03:20.950
I should go.

03:20.950 --> 03:25.079
- No, no, you don't have to leave.
- I-- I think that would be best.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.627
Oh, I'll walk you out.

03:36.090 --> 03:39.010
Ellary woke up.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.595
She was crying.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.514
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I didn't know if she was hungry,

03:43.514 --> 03:46.976
so I gave her the sippy cup thing
that was in the fridge.

03:46.976 --> 03:50.230
- Was that supposed to be heated up?
- No. Thank you.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.564
Yeah.

03:52.232 --> 03:57.487
Um, Hudson's soccer game is tomorrow.
Well, I mean, really, it's today.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.074
Yeah, it's probably
not the best day for that.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.121
Hey, it's all good.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.459
I'll call you later.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.418
Mm.

04:28.017 --> 04:28.935
You were right.

04:31.854 --> 04:35.942
I couldn't hold them back any longer
and they crashed all over me.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.986
All those beautiful moments.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.862
Oh, Cooper.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.994
I wish I fought harder for you.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.997
I don't know if it would've
made any difference...

04:50.248 --> 04:52.208
but you are the love of my life.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.087
But I'm not yours.

05:00.425 --> 05:05.305
And that hurts so damn much.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.224
Oh, my God.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.018
Come here.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.632
Mommy.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.054
Daddy's here. He's downstairs.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.805
I know, baby.

05:47.805 --> 05:48.806
- Hello.
- Dada.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.350
Yes, Dada. Come here, my girl.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.186
Oh, my goodness.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.522
Oh, come here, my loves.

05:57.398 --> 06:00.068
Oh. Come here. Come here, angel.

06:00.943 --> 06:01.778
Come here.

06:08.576 --> 06:13.623
<i>As women, we are taught from childhood
the importance of making others happy.</i>

06:14.665 --> 06:18.086
<i>Be pretty, be quiet, be fun.</i>

06:19.462 --> 06:23.216
<i>Be just the way he wants you to be.</i>

06:30.306 --> 06:34.185
<i>So we learn how to navigate
to present only the parts of ourselves</i>

06:34.185 --> 06:37.522
<i>that are pleasing
to whomever we're trying to please.</i>

06:39.232 --> 06:42.276
<i>But those other parts are still there,</i>

06:42.276 --> 06:45.780
<i>brewing, stewing
in the displeasure of being ignored,</i>

06:45.780 --> 06:50.118
<i>denied, hidden away
and covered with a pretty smile.</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:53.246
<i>A good girl who's really just...</i>

06:59.794 --> 07:00.628
<i>scared.</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:25.778
Hey, <i>khoshgelam.</i>

07:27.029 --> 07:27.864
Good morning.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.368
Why did you let me sleep so late?

07:32.869 --> 07:35.413
Oh, because you were
at the restaurant late.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.416
Besides, I had plenty to keep me busy.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.878
How's the dissertation coming?

07:41.878 --> 07:42.879
It's coming.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.756
It's been a long time coming,

07:45.756 --> 07:49.135
so I've thought a lot
about what I wanna say.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.554
That's great.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.477
It's really spring.

07:59.020 --> 08:03.774
And my buddy, Matteo, called, he wants us
to join him on his boat this weekend.

08:03.774 --> 08:08.779
They're taking it out of dry dock,
sailing to Montauk,

08:09.530 --> 08:11.657
stopping at a bunch of wineries
on the way.

08:11.657 --> 08:17.413
That sounds incredible,
but I have my kids this weekend.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.331
Remember?

08:18.331 --> 08:22.335
Oh, shit.
Is there any way you could switch?

08:23.836 --> 08:24.795
Uh...

08:25.546 --> 08:28.299
I don't know.
I could, but I don't want to. I--

08:28.883 --> 08:31.385
I wanna see my kids.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.386
Of course.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.349
- No, I just--
- Yeah. Look, um...

08:38.392 --> 08:39.936
we should talk about this.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.565
After the accident, um...

08:46.526 --> 08:51.572
I-- I kind of just let things
go back to the way they were.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.991
- Billie--
- And I could tell that you were spooked,

08:54.700 --> 08:59.413
and I didn't wanna make things worse,
but we had such a great time that day.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.166
Hudson hasn't stopped
talking about it or you.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.626
But a month...

09:05.711 --> 09:07.755
is a long time for a kid.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.258
So if you're not gonna come around again,

09:10.258 --> 09:13.469
then I should probably let him know.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.554
No.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.306
No, that's not what I want.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.854
Saturday is opening day at Yankee Stadium.
I'll get us tickets.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.482
Are you serious?

09:26.482 --> 09:29.485
That sounds great.
But Sasha's book launch is on Saturday,

09:29.485 --> 09:31.988
and I was hoping
to just slip away for an hour or two.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.906
Maybe we could go to the game on Sunday?

09:33.906 --> 09:37.702
Or maybe Hudson and I
could go to opening day on our own.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.621
Just the two of you?

09:40.621 --> 09:41.747
Like a bro day.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.500
One-on-one, crackerjack,
hot dogs, easy-peasy.

09:44.500 --> 09:49.505
Okay, I mean, only if that's what you want
because I don't wanna force you.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.799
It is what I want.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.593
This is gonna be fun.

09:58.848 --> 10:03.185
Apparently, Singapore is the number one
easiest place to live as an expat.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.271
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.066
One in every six households
is a millionaire?

10:09.066 --> 10:10.401
- Fancy.
- Ooh.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.154
Which means you can end up
paying 15 bucks for a zucchini.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.239
It's not too late to come with.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.326
Last I checked,
seat 2B was still available.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.036
- Kam.
- Okay, I bought it.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.580
- Just in case.
- Kam.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.334
I'm sorry. I don't understand why
you won't even consider coming with me.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.918
I did consider it.

10:27.918 --> 10:31.005
For one night?
The next morning, it was a hard no.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.591
You're asking me
to give up my entire life,

10:33.591 --> 10:35.384
not to mention my career.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.470
You are a giant success now.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.389
You can write your books
and your tweets from anywhere.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.851
And tell all my fans I moved
to the other side of the world for a man?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.063
For love and adventure.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.149
- See, there's a way to spin it.
- And what about you? Hmm?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.944
Did you consider for longer
than one second not taking this job?

10:53.944 --> 10:55.321
You said it was a done deal,

10:55.321 --> 10:57.698
but you could undo it
if you really wanted to.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.493
Figure out how to run
that organization from New York.

11:00.493 --> 11:05.081
- Sasha, people are counting on me.
- And people aren't counting on me?

11:05.998 --> 11:09.835
I have a foundation, Kam, a business.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.422
I'm up for tenure at Columbia.
You need to check your sexist bullshit.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.423
What does that mean?

11:14.423 --> 11:19.136
Why is it always your assumption that the
woman should be the one to change course?

11:19.136 --> 11:20.846
Give up her plans for the man?

11:22.807 --> 11:23.641
Okay.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.771
Let's say I give up the job,
stayed in New York.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.564
Would you ever stand up to Mick?

11:34.276 --> 11:35.236
Hmm.

11:37.154 --> 11:40.741
We've been living
in this no man's land for the past month,

11:40.741 --> 11:42.243
flying under the radar.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.329
How do I know
you won't leave me stranded again?

11:45.329 --> 11:49.333
Will the author of <i>Unattached</i>
ever really attach to anyone?

11:49.333 --> 11:51.043
So that's the real problem, hmm.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.672
You don't trust me enough
to take the chance.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.174
You haven't given me a reason to.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.475
Can I at least see you off
at the airport Saturday?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.396
- After my book launch?
- I think that's a no.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.189
Just too hard.

12:12.189 --> 12:15.943
Another airport heartbreak
might turn me off travel forever.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.572
- Can't risk that, not in my line of work.
- So...

12:21.657 --> 12:22.616
this is goodbye?

12:25.828 --> 12:26.662
I guess so.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.383
Hi, I'm Cooper.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.552
I wouldn't exactly say
that I'm an alcoholic.

12:41.552 --> 12:45.181
But I--
I have been 30 days without drinking.

12:50.019 --> 12:54.398
This last year
has been the hardest year of my life.

12:57.860 --> 13:02.031
I tried a lot of things
to deal with my pain.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.911
Alcohol, drugs...

13:09.038 --> 13:10.289
sex.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.502
But the one thing that I didn't do
was talk about it.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.755
And that's why coming here

13:19.256 --> 13:22.676
and listening to everyone
be so honest, so...

13:23.844 --> 13:27.056
So willing to look at themselves
and what they've done,

13:27.681 --> 13:32.311
I really admire that because I've been
trying to do everything that I can

13:33.604 --> 13:35.773
to avoid taking responsibility for--

13:36.524 --> 13:38.108
For my part in, uh...

13:43.030 --> 13:43.948
Uh...

13:44.740 --> 13:46.116
In my marriage failing.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.995
I used to be such a good guy.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.043
- I haven't been a good guy lately.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.884
And a lot of people...

14:06.720 --> 14:11.517
have spent a lot of time trying to help me
get back to the person that I was.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.686
I wouldn't let them.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.357
All I can do now is try and make it up.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.822
Try and make amends, right?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.450
Just keep moving forward.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.037
- So...

14:41.171 --> 14:42.131
Weird, right?

14:43.257 --> 14:47.344
Never thought I'd be the guy giving weepy
confessionals to a room full of strangers.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.388
Don't tell Mom.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.683
- I sent her the video. Was that wrong?
- Bet you did.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.729
Hey, I'm really proud of you.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.273
Thank you.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.776
For everything,
for keeping me out of jail.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.781
- I mean, I probably deserve to go.
- No, you're here.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.036
You paid your fine. You're doing
a boatload of community service.

15:12.036 --> 15:16.165
And bonus, Piper and Bianca,
they agreed to settle the lawsuit.

15:16.874 --> 15:17.708
You're kidding me.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.628
Let's just say
you're not retiring any time soon.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.547
But it's done, and they're okay?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.008
It's enough, right?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.470
It's time to put all this behind you,
focus on the future.

15:30.137 --> 15:34.016
Yeah, because the future
seems so bright, huh?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.310
It's a blank slate.

15:38.854 --> 15:42.650
Well, that's the scary part.
What am I gonna fill it with?

15:44.568 --> 15:47.446
Now that, I can't wait to see.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.534
<i>It's opening day in the Big Apple.</i>

15:52.534 --> 15:54.036
<i>A great day here in the Bronx</i>

15:54.036 --> 15:58.791
<i>and a great day for Major League Baseball.
The Yanks will be squaring off...</i>

15:58.791 --> 16:00.501
- Hi.
-  Majid.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.337
Who's more excited about this game?
You or me?

16:03.337 --> 16:05.756
- Me.
-  Hi.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.384
Oh, he wants a Mickey Mantle bat.
Do not get it for him.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.052
I got something better.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.389
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.766
Yes. Come on, come here. Oh.

16:16.725 --> 16:17.559
Arms up.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.730
Uh... Whoops.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.733
- Sorry.
- It's no big deal.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.611
We'll get a smaller one at the game.
Let's go.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.196
I'll go get the car seat.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.489
- Right.
-  Yes.

16:30.489 --> 16:34.201
- You can't duct tape him to the back.
- I'm gonna get this. I promise.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.537
- Let's do it. Let's go.
- Come on.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.454
Come on.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.711
Dude, wipe that smile off your face.

16:43.711 --> 16:47.756
- I'm still the reigning pickleball champ.
- Okay, but not today you're not.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.634
You only beat my ass there
'cause I'm a month out of surgery.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.136
Wait till I get my lob back.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.221
I'm glad to know
that's your biggest problem.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.307
Seriously, I had a huge realization
in that crash.

16:58.142 --> 17:03.772
- What have we been doing with our lives?
- Right? I mean, I'm turning it all around.

17:04.523 --> 17:09.361
Like, blank slate.
In fact, I'm thinking about calling Emily.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.196
- Wait, what?
- Mm-hm.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.281
Emily, your ex?

17:12.281 --> 17:15.492
Emily stick-in-the-mud,
sweater set, vanilla latte Emily?

17:15.492 --> 17:17.578
Same Emily you tried to hook me up with.

17:17.578 --> 17:21.081
To make you feel better.
She had puppy dog eyes.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.917
- She thought you could do no wrong.
- Yeah, exactly.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.421
Maybe that's what I need now.
I don't know.

17:28.172 --> 17:32.009
Maybe she was the right woman
for me all along.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.011
You are a fucking snooze-o-rama.

17:34.011 --> 17:39.433
Dude, what I realized is that I've been
wasting my life, at least my sex life.

17:40.225 --> 17:44.188
- I have so many more sexual voyages ahead.
- Okay, Dev. I...

17:45.814 --> 17:47.107
I didn't wanna ask,

17:47.107 --> 17:51.278
but I thought that after the accident
that everything down there, it--

17:51.904 --> 17:53.322
It might have been, uh...

17:55.574 --> 17:56.867
impacted?

17:58.118 --> 18:01.955
Are you kidding? They reconstructed it.
I actually gained an inch.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.416
Really? Okay.

18:04.416 --> 18:08.170
Look, one of the tendons was cut.
But that's a good thing.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.173
- It let some of my inner penis fall out.
- I'm sorry. Inner penis?

18:11.173 --> 18:13.592
We all got one, dude.
You can't tell when it's soft.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.220
- Let me fire it up for you.
- What the hell are you doing?

18:16.220 --> 18:19.098
Doc put a pump in.
I need a little help after the remodel.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.225
- I-- I don't wanna see this.
- I wanna see it.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.477
Yeah, everything's fully automated.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.438
I have a stylish new curve, which is cool.
Chicks dig it, right?

18:26.438 --> 18:28.690
Makes it easier to hit the G-spot.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.111
If you actually believe
the G-spot's a thing, am I right?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.655
Who'd have thought
that Piper biting my penis off

18:34.655 --> 18:39.701
would give me a whole new lease on life?
My man, I am just getting started.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.417
- How you doing, champ?
- I'm hungry. Can I have a snack?

18:47.417 --> 18:48.794
Uh...

18:51.046 --> 18:53.715
- I have a mint.
- You don't have any snacks?

18:53.715 --> 18:56.635
- One sec. Hey, Alonso. What's up?

18:56.635 --> 18:59.263
-  <i>Eva quit.</i>
- What? Shit!

18:59.263 --> 19:02.266
- You owe me a dollar.
-<i>You gotta come in.</i>

19:02.266 --> 19:04.351
Um, Christophe's gotta take over.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.728
<i>- On a Saturday dinner rush?</i>
- It's not a good night.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.981
<i>It's not a good night for any of us.</i>

19:11.441 --> 19:14.736
- Gotta make a quick pit stop, buddy.
- Okay.

19:14.736 --> 19:18.198
How would you like
another Nutella lava melt, huh?

19:19.116 --> 19:20.492
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.952
That's what I'm talking about.

19:37.968 --> 19:38.969
What's going on?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
You can't be nervous.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.560
You're a superstar.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.854
It's not that.

19:49.938 --> 19:50.772
It's this.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.195
His plane leaves
in four hours and 35 minutes.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.155
Not that I set a timer on my phone.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.868
- Oh, honey.
- It's for the best.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.995
He can move on and so will I.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.415
I can focus on my work,
maybe find a new Kam.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.709
- Just like you found Majid.
- Or...

20:12.628 --> 20:15.839
Or what? I'm gonna go live in Singapore?

20:16.548 --> 20:17.382
You could.

20:18.759 --> 20:23.013
Sash, this isn't about
the logistics of work and life.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.598
This is about power.

20:25.390 --> 20:30.771
Who sacrifices for whom,
and someone always has to give first.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.232
You are the one who gave up your power,

20:33.232 --> 20:37.986
sacrificed a huge part of yourself
for a man with disastrous results.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.864
- You're telling me to do the same thing?
- It's not the same.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.451
Cooper and I weren't right for each other,
but I still believe in marriage.

20:44.451 --> 20:48.997
I still believe in that kind
of partnership, and honestly...

20:50.374 --> 20:54.086
if I could go back
and do it all over again...

20:56.838 --> 20:59.883
I might say yes to Brad's proposal
on my driveway.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.262
That kind of love comes...

21:04.554 --> 21:05.847
once in a lifetime.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.644
Now, it's too late for us.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.481
But it's not too late for you and Kam.

21:16.566 --> 21:20.946
Honey, you have a second chance.
Are you sure you don't wanna take it?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.741
Sasha, my star.

21:24.741 --> 21:25.867
Gran.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.287
- Hi, Billie.
- Hi there, Roz.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.872
- I'm so glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?

21:30.872 --> 21:33.709
This is your manifest destiny.

21:33.709 --> 21:38.839
It is my honor to see you exactly
where you're supposed to be.

21:46.221 --> 21:51.810
I am the master of my fate,
the captain of my soul.

21:53.395 --> 21:59.192
For decades,
those were words reserved for men alone.

21:59.192 --> 22:04.614
Women were expected to support,
to bend, to comply,

22:04.614 --> 22:10.078
to derive their power
from the men to whom they were attached.

22:11.747 --> 22:16.084
But this is a new era for women,

22:16.960 --> 22:20.881
for anyone
who wants to answer only to themselves

22:20.881 --> 22:27.179
and stand unattached
in the glory and power of doing...

22:28.472 --> 22:29.890
what you want...

22:31.475 --> 22:32.434
when you want...

22:35.145 --> 22:36.521
with whomever you want.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.657
Come with me.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.453
Um... [clears throat]. Sorry.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.593
When you follow your own path,
find your own way,

23:06.593 --> 23:10.472
you never have to ask yourself
what life could have been...

23:11.765 --> 23:18.271
because you can make it
exactly what you want it to be.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.484
Thank you.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.256
Great.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.968
Thank you so much for coming.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.722
I'm supposed to get home to Ellary,
but are you okay?

23:52.722 --> 23:55.183
- We did it.
- Roz.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.935
Yes, it is all about me.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.937
Well, call me.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.356
From wherever you end up.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.110
Have a good night.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.071
Oh, it's a shame about Billie.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.824
- Gran.
- She's back at school.

24:10.824 --> 24:15.036
You said. I know.
But she wasted so much time.

24:15.036 --> 24:18.540
You stayed the course.
Didn't let yourself get distracted.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.586
Now you've got everything
you could ever want.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.214
Except I'm alone.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.850
Gran, I will always be grateful to you

24:37.559 --> 24:41.146
for insisting I not throw away my dreams
all those years ago.

24:41.730 --> 24:46.818
I don't think any of this would exist if
I had run off to California when I was 22.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.320
Damn straight.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.406
But I'm not 22 anymore.

24:53.783 --> 24:54.618
And...

24:56.786 --> 24:59.748
I'm not sure this is
how I wanna spend the rest of my life.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.626
Why not?

25:08.506 --> 25:09.758
Kam is back.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.967
Oh, God.

25:10.967 --> 25:15.055
He still loves me.
He wants me to move to Singapore with him.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.934
Of course he does.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.311
So after all this time,

25:21.311 --> 25:23.563
you're just gonna
turn into one of those girls

25:23.563 --> 25:27.192
- who chucks it all to run after some man?
- Not some man.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.071
Kam.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.615
And maybe I am that girl, okay?

25:33.615 --> 25:36.576
Who gets swept away to Rome

25:36.576 --> 25:40.330
and who says yes
to a crazy proposal at the MET and--

25:41.289 --> 25:44.417
And who wants to follow the love
of her life to a tiny island in Asia

25:44.417 --> 25:47.045
where the zucchinis cost
15 fucking dollars.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.969
I've got the success now.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.640
I want the man too.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.686
I wanna at least try to have it all,

26:03.561 --> 26:07.899
so I don't spend the rest of my life
wondering, "What if?"

26:09.150 --> 26:11.152
You just stood on that stage.

26:12.028 --> 26:17.993
Your entire essence is convincing women
to live life on their own terms.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.912
Now, you're gonna go and do the opposite?

26:22.038 --> 26:23.540
Maybe these are my terms.

26:29.004 --> 26:29.921
Hey, buddy.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.673
Only a few more minutes.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.384
I checked the score,
Yanks are up three to nothing.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.303
You need anything? More hot chocolate?

26:36.303 --> 26:37.595
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:39.556 --> 26:42.642
Majid, you gotta take this.
I got a lead on a replacement chef.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.560
Oh.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.215
Great.

27:14.215 --> 27:17.969
We got five grilled prawns coming up.
Don't step back. I'm behind.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.054
We gotta go!

27:19.054 --> 27:21.306
- Flash the tagine for me!
- Excuse me?

27:21.306 --> 27:23.975
What are you doing here?
You gotta go, man.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.687
- Can I have more hot chocolate?
- What?

27:28.396 --> 27:30.774
- Shit, shit!
- I'll get the extinguisher!

27:30.774 --> 27:33.318
It's spreading! Oh, my God!

27:33.318 --> 27:35.612
- Call 911!
- Hudson, why are you in the kitchen?

27:35.612 --> 27:37.781
You're not allowed in here!
What are you doing?

27:41.159 --> 27:43.703
Stay right here! Do not move!

28:08.603 --> 28:11.231
Hey, how's the game?
Are the Yankees winning?

28:11.231 --> 28:14.025
<i>Billie, I'm so sorry.</i>

28:15.777 --> 28:16.611
What happened?

28:17.654 --> 28:20.323
His name's Hudson Connelly.
He's 6 years old.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.367
- He's probably three feet tall.
-  Cooper.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.327
- Cooper.
- Hey.

28:26.162 --> 28:30.917
Oh, my God. I'm so, so sorry.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.920
-  Stop.
- I'm so sorry.

28:33.920 --> 28:38.091
- No, no, stop. It's not your fault.
- It's my fault.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.302
I know, I'm the one who's sorry.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.012
Why did you even bring Hudson here?

28:43.012 --> 28:46.433
- You were supposed to be at the game.
- It was supposed to be a quick stop.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.809
And you didn't think to call

28:47.809 --> 28:50.854
or to even text me to let me know
where you were taking my son?

28:50.854 --> 28:53.440
Billie, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find him.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.024
I got my staff out there looking.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.360
Well, I'm not just
gonna sit around here and wait.

28:58.528 --> 29:01.030
Okay, I'll head east. You go west. Yeah?

29:01.030 --> 29:02.282
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.118
- I'll come with you.
- No. Don't.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.412
Billie.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.377
- What are you doing here?
- Alonso called all the investors.

29:14.377 --> 29:17.630
- How bad is it?
- I don't know, but Hudson was here,

29:17.630 --> 29:19.174
and now he's missing.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.259
- He ran away.
- What?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.887
- I need to go find him.
- I'm coming with you.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.681
I have no idea
where he would even think to go.

29:26.681 --> 29:29.392
- Does he have a favorite spot?
- He doesn't know the city.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.853
He's only been
to Majid's restaurant once before.

29:31.853 --> 29:35.398
Um, the day that
we ran into you in the park.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.818
He loved that bubble guy, remember?
The park's just up here.

29:39.652 --> 29:41.529
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, come on, come on.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.948
Mick is in a very important meeting
right now.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.456
Nice brotox, buddy.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.582
Ow, ow.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.544
What's the matter with you?
My maxillofacials are very sensitive.

29:56.544 --> 30:00.507
- This is who I was, but it's not who I am.
- The fuck is that supposed to mean?

30:00.507 --> 30:03.468
I'm not gonna live a lie anymore
and I'm not gonna hide.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.136
Do I look like I have a vagina?

30:05.136 --> 30:07.931
Save it for <i>The View</i>.
You got a book tour coming up.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.183
I'll do the tour for <i>Unattached,</i>

30:10.183 --> 30:15.104
but only as a promotion
for my next book, <i>Sustained By Love.</i>

30:15.104 --> 30:18.191
So schmaltzy.
<i>Shitstained By Love</i> is more like it.

30:18.191 --> 30:22.987
And last, I checked, your 10%
was paying me to set your brand strategy.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.198
Who are you to start barking orders?

30:25.198 --> 30:29.327
I'm Sasha fucking Snow.
And I've got a plane to catch.

30:34.457 --> 30:37.669
Hey, have you seen a little boy
about this tall, blond?

30:37.669 --> 30:38.920
- No?
- No?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.555
I don't see anyone.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.932
Hey. Hey, Billie. Billie, look at me.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.310
We're gonna find him, all right?
Here or somewhere else.

31:00.775 --> 31:01.609
Hudson?

31:04.863 --> 31:05.905
Hudson!

31:05.905 --> 31:08.074
- Mommy?
-  Huds.

31:10.785 --> 31:11.661
Hi, Mama.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.913
I was so worried about you.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.084
There was a fire.

31:18.084 --> 31:21.045
And Majid yelled at me,
and he owes me a dollar.

31:21.629 --> 31:24.799
I came to see bubble man,
but bubble man's not here.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.509
Yes, I know, baby. I know.

31:26.509 --> 31:29.846
That was just a special treat,
not every day.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.724
Those bubbles were great though, eh, mate?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.144
- You're that guy. Mommy's friend.
-  Yeah.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.396
Mommy's friend.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.945
Hey, you can never run away again.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.906
Okay? Ever.

31:47.906 --> 31:48.990
I'm sorry.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.242
That's okay.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.787
You know, I know what it's like to be
a scared little kid in New York City.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.958
So don't worry. Okay?

32:10.011 --> 32:12.680
-  You said you wanted my sneakers.
-  Oh, I do.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.351
- You said they were cool kicks.
- Wasn't that funny?

32:17.018 --> 32:19.938
The way you were looking at him,
I was like...

32:20.772 --> 32:22.273
- Oh!
- Daddy.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.444
Oh, buddy, hey.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.071
You had us worried sick.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.997
Thank you for your help.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.832
I didn't do anything.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.167
Oh, yes, you did.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.420
It was Brad's idea where to find Hudson.

32:44.420 --> 32:48.675
He remembered this park
that we'd all been at last month

32:48.675 --> 32:53.346
- where we ran into each other.
- Well, I'm very grateful.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.017
We both are.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.651
Well, I should get inside
and check out the damage.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.111
Check on Majid.

33:29.465 --> 33:30.925
I'll see you around, little man.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.844
Oh, yeah. Nice.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.139
Can you come home with us, Daddy?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.518
- It's fine with me.
- Yeah?

33:40.518 --> 33:44.022
Yeah, we can--
We can set up the guest room again.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.316
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Okay, baby?

33:47.316 --> 33:49.318
- Okay?
- Hey, that would be great.

33:50.194 --> 33:53.823
But, hey, listen to me.
I'm gonna meet you there. Okay?

33:53.823 --> 33:55.658
I just need to do one thing first.

33:55.658 --> 33:57.118
- All right?
- Okay. Yeah.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.436
Kam, wait.

34:25.521 --> 34:28.816
- Sasha, what are you doing here?
- I'm coming with you.

34:30.026 --> 34:32.862
I don't have anything.
I ran here straight from my book launch.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.948
Well, that and telling Mick
to go fuck himself.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.870
I'm gonna have to buy
a whole new wardrobe in Singapore.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.790
Or, considering the whole
$15 zucchini situation,

34:43.790 --> 34:46.167
may be cheaper
to have Billie send me all my stuff.

34:46.167 --> 34:51.964
Sasha, I'm touched, really,
but you can't come to Singapore.

34:51.964 --> 34:55.802
Yes. I can and I am.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.514
Look, somebody has to give first.

35:01.641 --> 35:02.475
And it's me.

35:04.060 --> 35:08.564
I wanna give for you. For us.

35:10.483 --> 35:14.112
For everything we could be
for the next 17 years of our lives.

35:15.738 --> 35:16.864
It's like you said.

35:19.033 --> 35:23.287
I just don't wanna wake up
one single morning without you in my arms.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.876
I love you, Sasha Snow.

35:30.586 --> 35:33.422
But you cannot come to Singapore.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.386
- Why not?
-  Dr. Evans.

35:41.472 --> 35:43.724
We were able to get your luggage
off the plane.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.226
Thank you so much.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.775
Because I'm giving first too.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.528
You were right.

35:56.279 --> 36:00.158
It shouldn't always be the woman
who's expected to change course.

36:00.783 --> 36:01.951
I don't wanna be that man

36:01.951 --> 36:04.704
that keeps asking you
to give up your life and follow mine.

36:06.831 --> 36:10.418
The woman I love lives in New York City.

36:12.795 --> 36:17.425
Her life is here,
and I belong wherever she is.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.220
So I'm staying.

36:24.056 --> 36:24.891
Really?

36:52.960 --> 36:53.794
<i>Come on up.</i>

37:04.222 --> 37:08.142
And this is why I know
this is gonna be your best year yet.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.478
To the birthday girl.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.563
To Emily.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.440
Cheers. I love you.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.441
Cheers.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.238
Cooper?

37:24.909 --> 37:26.035
What are you doing here?

37:28.454 --> 37:29.789
Wanted to say happy birthday.

37:30.581 --> 37:31.916
Nice to see you, Coop.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.086
Why don't you say a few words?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.672
Oh, no, that's okay.
I don't...

37:37.672 --> 37:38.923
I don't drink anymore.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.300
Um...

37:43.219 --> 37:45.137
I do wanna say something though.

37:46.013 --> 37:46.889
Uh...

37:48.474 --> 37:51.978
Didn't realize I was gonna be saying it
in front of all of you.

37:52.895 --> 37:57.441
But I've realized
that you can lose the people you love

37:57.441 --> 37:58.901
in the blink of an eye.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.654
So...

38:04.156 --> 38:08.244
twelve years ago,
I wasn't the right man for you.

38:09.912 --> 38:12.790
And I couldn't appreciate
all the things that you have to offer,

38:12.790 --> 38:14.375
and that list is long.

38:14.375 --> 38:18.421
You're compassionate, understanding,
you never give up on anyone.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.922
You never gave up on me.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.760
I am not in the same place
that I was the last time you saw me.

38:24.760 --> 38:29.348
I'm doing the work. I'm trying to be
the man that you have always seen in me.

38:29.849 --> 38:33.227
I still don't know
if I'm the man that you deserve, but--

38:46.991 --> 38:49.493
So you don't need
to think about it or you--?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.038
My birthday wish came true.

39:23.736 --> 39:24.570
Majid.

39:26.155 --> 39:26.989
<i>Khoshgelam.</i>

39:30.451 --> 39:32.578
Looks like the place is on the mend.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.749
Yeah, we should be
able to reopen next week.

39:37.249 --> 39:39.043
Oh, that's great. I'm glad.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.170
Look, um...

39:44.048 --> 39:46.717
I'm really sorry for what happened.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.676
Me too.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.764
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I know. I--

39:52.348 --> 39:54.433
Just needed a couple of days to cool down.

39:54.433 --> 39:59.855
I didn't wanna make any big decisions
while my emotions were running high.

39:59.855 --> 40:02.817
Billie, I love you so much.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.028
Our time together
has meant everything to me.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.198
But I'm not a dad.

40:10.408 --> 40:15.037
I'm not good at tiny feelings
and car seats and schedules.

40:15.037 --> 40:17.373
The only baby I have is my restaurant.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.377
And honestly,
that's the only baby I've ever wanted.

40:21.961 --> 40:22.795
I know.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.923
But don't break up with me.

40:26.590 --> 40:30.553
There's so much good.
We could go back to the way things were.

40:31.178 --> 40:33.222
Maybe that was the secret sauce.

40:33.222 --> 40:37.852
You have your life in Connecticut
and we have our life together here.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.020
It was working.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.647
Oh, there is so much good.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.609
And there's so much fun to be had, but...

40:48.195 --> 40:49.238
it's not enough.

40:51.907 --> 40:54.326
If there's anything that I've learned...

40:56.412 --> 40:59.248
it's that I don't wanna split my life
into two parts.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.628
And if I can't be in a relationship
that allows me...

41:05.796 --> 41:07.673
to be all of who I am...

41:11.010 --> 41:12.511
then I'd rather be alone.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.604
You're something else.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.566
So I've been told.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.146
Ladies, are you ready to experience

42:46.146 --> 42:49.275
multiple G-spot and cervical orgasms?

42:49.984 --> 42:53.195
Increased strength
leads to increased sensation.

42:54.530 --> 42:58.826
Now, the G-spot may have been named
after the guy who "discovered" it,

42:59.827 --> 43:02.621
but you certainly don't need a man
to find it for yourself.

43:03.872 --> 43:07.543
- Is she holding that with her--
- Pussy? Sure is.

43:09.336 --> 43:10.254
Okay.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.803
I think I'm gonna need a smaller coconut.

43:21.348 --> 43:23.475
Wilhelmina Mann.

43:24.476 --> 43:30.357

43:57.343 --> 43:58.927
This is the last of it.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.180
There's no more room,

44:01.180 --> 44:03.390
unless you wanna
try and Cooper Connelly it.

44:03.390 --> 44:04.642
What do I always say?

44:04.642 --> 44:07.561
- There's always room.
- There's always room.

44:07.561 --> 44:09.438
Oh, Cooper. This was so nice.

44:10.022 --> 44:11.940
- Thank you so much.
- Absolutely.

44:12.941 --> 44:13.776
Hey.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.279
I'm proud of you, Dr. Mann.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.447
Yes.

44:25.537 --> 44:28.874
Actually, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.752
- Yeah?
- Uh...

44:35.089 --> 44:36.924
I'm gonna ask Emily to marry me.

44:37.925 --> 44:38.801
Oh.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.761
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44:40.761 --> 44:44.390
It turns out you can have
more than one love of your life.

44:45.432 --> 44:49.561
It's not just that
she's the right woman for me, um...

44:52.731 --> 44:55.734
It's that I'm the right man for her.

44:55.734 --> 44:56.944
And when I'm with her...

44:58.570 --> 45:00.030
I feel like I'm enough.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.075
That's an amazing feeling.

45:04.451 --> 45:08.997
I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna
say sweater sets and vanilla lattes--

45:08.997 --> 45:10.541
No, no, no, Cooper.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.167
I-- I was gonna say...

45:12.835 --> 45:13.669
Um...

45:14.878 --> 45:16.088
Emily's lovely.

45:17.005 --> 45:19.133
That's the kind of girl I thought...

45:21.009 --> 45:22.803
you should have been with all along.

45:23.512 --> 45:27.433
And if I had been more honest
with myself and you...

45:30.185 --> 45:32.896
then maybe you could have been.

45:35.607 --> 45:37.943
I will never regret our time together.

45:38.694 --> 45:41.613
- We made two beautiful children.
- No.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.116
It's not just that.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.453
It's you.

45:48.996 --> 45:50.247
You are...

45:51.999 --> 45:52.875
formidable.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.296
And for whatever time
I was able to call you mine,

45:59.506 --> 46:01.967
I consider myself incredibly lucky.

46:03.552 --> 46:04.678
And deeply...

46:06.221 --> 46:07.347
deeply grateful.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.058
Oh, Cooper.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.271
I'm so happy for you.

46:15.939 --> 46:17.065
And Emily.

46:17.816 --> 46:18.650
Thank you.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.030
So...

46:25.115 --> 46:26.033
I gotta ask...

46:29.077 --> 46:30.120
Are you happy?

46:32.122 --> 46:33.165
Uh...

46:33.957 --> 46:35.501
I am. Yeah.

46:36.460 --> 46:41.548
I mean, this isn't the fairy tale
I imagined for myself, but you know,

46:42.299 --> 46:48.055
I've got friends, work, kids I adore,
a pretty cute and responsible co-parent.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.267
It's a fairy tale of its own kind.

47:01.735 --> 47:06.782
<i>In the end, all of us will look back
on our lives and say one of two things:</i>

47:09.284 --> 47:12.579
<i>"I wish I had," or "I'm glad I did."</i>

47:16.083 --> 47:19.545
<i>We've had so many amazing
"I'm glad I did" moments...</i>

47:21.380 --> 47:24.591
<i>even in those teary, soul-crushing days.</i>

47:25.425 --> 47:31.014
<i>I'm glad I had those moments too,
because I had them with you.</i>

47:33.684 --> 47:37.771
You're that rare person
who has no "I wish I hads,"

47:38.897 --> 47:41.358
who fearlessly says yes,

47:42.150 --> 47:45.571
even now to a man who is the definition...

47:47.281 --> 47:48.615
of "I'm glad I did."

47:50.117 --> 47:55.747
You are proud,
passionate, open to the world.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.211
And most of all, my best friend.

48:03.505 --> 48:05.549
So, Kam, enjoy her.

48:08.635 --> 48:11.555
But don't forget, it's you and me.

48:13.265 --> 48:14.099
Always.

48:15.809 --> 48:17.060
Always.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.145
To Sasha and Kam.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.397
-  To Sasha and Kam.
-  Cheers.

48:20.397 --> 48:23.567
-  Yeah.
-  Congratulations, Sasha and Kam.

48:31.575 --> 48:32.576
<i>You and me.</i>

48:33.785 --> 48:34.620
<i>Always.</i>

48:58.477 --> 49:00.270
That was beautiful, Billie.

49:01.229 --> 49:03.190
You've always had a way with words.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.983
What are you doing here?

49:07.486 --> 49:09.780
I asked Sasha if I could
come and surprise you,

49:09.780 --> 49:11.323
sweep you off your feet.

49:12.949 --> 49:15.994
She made me promise
to wait until after the cake, but...

49:26.838 --> 49:28.715
Where's Gigi?

49:29.424 --> 49:30.258
She left.

49:31.968 --> 49:32.969
A while ago, actually.

49:34.721 --> 49:38.475
She's with someone else now,
who didn't just lose his company.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.315
We both knew in our hearts that I could...

49:46.942 --> 49:48.652
I could never be hers completely.

49:50.946 --> 49:54.074
Because I've never stopped being yours.

49:58.537 --> 49:59.496
It's you, B.

50:01.039 --> 50:02.290
It's always been you.

50:05.127 --> 50:06.795
Please tell me this is real.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.172
It's real.

50:11.007 --> 50:11.842
We are real.

50:13.593 --> 50:17.055
We are undeniable.

50:19.099 --> 50:19.933
You know that.

50:23.478 --> 50:26.606
- I think I'm gonna faint. I...
- Here.

50:29.484 --> 50:30.318
I got you.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.280
And I...

50:35.240 --> 50:36.450
got you.
