WEBVTT

00:36.537 --> 00:39.790
Our "perfectly strong" campaign
is all about being authentic.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.708
Creating new role models.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.337
We want to see real people
like you and me in front of the camera.

00:53.428 --> 00:56.265
Beautiful

01:23.375 --> 01:26.378
I just love the products.
They make me feel so confident.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.547
- Beautiful.
- Invincible.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.292
- We're strong. Strong women.
- Yes, we feel beautiful and strong.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.176
Milan!

03:07.145 --> 03:09.064
We're just ourselves.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.150
We don't care what anyone thinks.
We make our own rules.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.823
This shit...

03:17.989 --> 03:19.157
Friday breakfast

03:57.863 --> 03:58.989
We are...

04:05.078 --> 04:06.997
10 minute break!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.797
What's going on? What are you doing?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.886
What?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.681
I... I thought it had been a while...

04:24.848 --> 04:26.057
Since...

04:26.308 --> 04:27.601
Oh!

04:30.353 --> 04:31.897
Right. No.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.565
Thanks, Iâ€œ

04:34.441 --> 04:36.359
I'm not really... thanks.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.236
Oh, right.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.198
- It has nothing to do with you.
- No, it's fine. I...

04:41.740 --> 04:43.158
Then I'll...

04:43.408 --> 04:45.285
I'll... make breakfast.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.913
Okay.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.379
Thank you.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.065
Hey! What the hell!

05:15.732 --> 05:17.609
What a...

05:18.527 --> 05:20.028
Nice ass.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.325
No, no, no.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.245
No, no, no, no!

05:34.835 --> 05:37.754
- Shit, got anything for a potbelly?
- Sure.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.847
- What is it?
- Prucalopride, it's a great laxative.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.058
If you need a prescription,
I have a contact. It's easy.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.310
Really? Awesome, thanks.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.691
Need a pick-me-up? It keeps you laughing.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.652
No, thanks. I'm doing enough coke already.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.073
Daddy!

06:05.240 --> 06:08.243
- Daddy's on the phone.
- I don't want to wear the tights.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.454
They're all I've got.
Look, they're thin. Now put them on.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.123
Sorry, it was important.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.667
Soma.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.627
- Sonja!
- Yes?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.963
- I got the promotion?
- Really? Great.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.798
Put them on, piet.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.385
- Piet, that's enough now!
- Why are you so annoyed at him?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.389
- He won't put his tights on.
- Yeah, but he's four.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.102
- Besides, it's summer.
- The washer is still broken.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.605
Oh. Sorry, Sonja.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.066
Sorry, it slipped my mind.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.861
Stop crying like a girl.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.324
I don't want to wear the tights.
They itch.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.993
Luke Skywalker always wears tights.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.830
Even in the desert.
You want to be like Luke Skywalker, right?

06:56.541 --> 06:57.834
Okay.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.797
Have you thought any more about the wall?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.884
I don't understand
what it is with you and that wall.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.847
We would finally have
a bit more space when the children come.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.724
They never come anyway.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.272
- What are you doing?
- I have to go to the office.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.233
Thilo needs me for...

07:22.400 --> 07:24.110
Something or other.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.739
They send me into retirement,
then can't cope without me.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.741
Do you want some coffee?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.660
I'm late.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.998
Stupid old thing.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.730
Excuse me.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.232
Yes?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.862
- Did you just whistle at me?
- What?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.698
It's just that...

08:10.448 --> 08:11.866
I just...

08:12.033 --> 08:13.994
I've always wanted that.

08:14.244 --> 08:18.665
For a total stranger to find me
really hot, on the spur of the moment.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.792
It's a huge compliment.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.796
Every woman wants it, and today,
I'm the chosen one. Now I'm all...

08:26.673 --> 08:28.133
Now...

08:28.299 --> 08:29.676
Now I'm all...

08:31.928 --> 08:32.929
Now...

08:33.096 --> 08:35.390
My legs are spreading all by themselves.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.642
No. Let's see... maybe like this?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.019
Oh, god.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.854
- Morning, Vicky.
- Morning.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.273
Morning.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.901
I meant the car, actually.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.659
- But if I can help...
- You're not needed here.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.204
I know an awful lot about engines.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.999
I oil my own.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.585
Okay.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.548
- See you around.
- I can hardly contain the excitement.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.277
Vicky!

09:30.153 --> 09:31.237
Vicky!

09:32.030 --> 09:34.240
- Hi.
- Listen,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.826
were you just talking to the new teacher?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.745
Really?

09:38.912 --> 09:42.290
- They'll take anyone these days.
- You two should go out.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.085
- Why?
- Well, because he's really hot.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.295
Oh, you mean for procreation.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.298
Okay, then. I'll put my life on hold
and raise his kids

09:50.465 --> 09:52.217
just because he's a genetic a+.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.844
You and your
weird "I prefer being alone" act.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.640
That's cheating. Don't you
want to try being a normal person again?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.892
There are good relationships, Vicky.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.769
How's the divorce going?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.650
Count yourself lucky you got out.
Seriously.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.611
There's nothing more stupid
than a woman in love.

10:12.529 --> 10:16.199
And once you've focused your attention
on your vagina,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.159
I want you to imagine

10:18.326 --> 10:21.079
that you're peeling an orange with it.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.623
Breathe in.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.084
Connect with your pelvic bone.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.629
And then push, keep pushing,

10:29.796 --> 10:31.673
applying constant pressure.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.675
And we push our orange...

10:33.842 --> 10:35.260
Out.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.181
Great.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.107
- Sorry, I'm weaning her.
- Really? Why so early?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.902
- So she sleeps through the night.
- I didn't breastfeed long either.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.030
- I don't want to ruin my breasts.
- So get a mommy makeover.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.409
- What's that?
- A mommy makeover. My colleague had one.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.912
She's good as new.
She has the labia of a 16-year-old.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.039
I'd do it right now if I had the money.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.918
Honestly, for me right now, sex is like
throwing a salami down a hallway.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.421
She had everything done? Her tummy too?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.756
Yes, her love channel too.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.634
I'd never go under the knife.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.724
What? I'm just disciplined.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.352
Being a mother
doesn't mean you have to let yourself go.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.063
I'm too tired to exercise.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.899
Does anyone have a cookie?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.611
You give her sugar?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.404
That's insane.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.198
She isn't even one yet.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.409
Everything she needs
until she's two is in your milk.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.870
It's a drug, you know.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.070
I thought that when he took
early retirement and the kids were gone,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.197
we 'd get a second chance.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.825
I can't remember
the last time he really looked at me.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.453
Maybe try wearing something other than...

12:26.746 --> 12:27.830
Beige.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.167
- Then maybe he'll see you.
- At some point, I turned invisible.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.461
God! You can do something about that.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.589
You think the way we look now
is supposed to be sexy? No!

12:38.341 --> 12:42.095
God was a misogynist. I mean,
we bleed, we give birth, we sweat...

12:42.262 --> 12:45.014
And in the end,
he leaves us with bodies like these.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.434
He didn't realize we'd want
to have a little fun too.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.978
Typical man.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.231
That's why
we have to take things into our own hands.

12:55.149 --> 12:59.112
Nobody wants to see old ladies with
shriveled cleavage. It's not pretty.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.822
I'm pragmatic about it.

13:01.072 --> 13:04.784
My breasts were saggy, I was miserable.
Now they're fixed and I'm happy.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.287
And so is my husband. Cheers!

13:08.538 --> 13:10.540
Nobody comes here before 11, frauke.

13:11.249 --> 13:15.128
Come on, we've no time to lose!
You'll be 60 next year, my dear!

13:17.714 --> 13:19.757
It can't be over already.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.927
So do a dance course,
if you insist on being old-fashioned.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.805
- A dance course?
- Everyone's doing it. Go for it!

13:26.055 --> 13:29.475
But Botox is effective against depression.
It's been proven.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.861
No, Picasso just isn't for me.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.448
I've never liked him.
Say what you like, but honestly...

13:43.614 --> 13:45.283
I mean, what's that about?

13:45.450 --> 13:48.995
Why are they staring at each other?
Are they sad they're fat?

13:49.162 --> 13:52.290
I don't see two women.
It's a woman and her reflection.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.918
But they look completely different.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.253
Exactly.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.382
And that's why the essay

14:05.178 --> 14:08.097
"why have there been
no great woman artists?"

14:08.723 --> 14:10.975
By Linda nocklin... nochlin...

14:11.225 --> 14:14.312
Was a seminal moment
for feminist art history.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.199
Yes, pauline. Great!
Thank you very much for that...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.951
Wonderful presentation
about an important woman,

14:29.118 --> 14:30.578
an early campaigner

14:31.162 --> 14:33.664
for an equal future in the art world.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.336
Any other questions?

14:40.963 --> 14:43.007
Can I sit back down?

14:44.467 --> 14:45.676
Yes.

14:48.221 --> 14:52.934
Tomorrow, we start our projects, which
we've all been looking forward to so much.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.604
After going through your suggestions...

14:57.230 --> 15:00.149
- "Drawing a giant weenie". Thanks, Tim.
- No problem.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.443
"3D-printed pugs".

15:02.610 --> 15:05.029
And my personal favorite, "let's Netflix".

15:05.196 --> 15:07.365
I've decided to choose a topic myself.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.033
"The power of images:

15:09.200 --> 15:12.078
Public representation of women's bodies

15:12.245 --> 15:14.247
from the renaissance to the present."

15:14.414 --> 15:16.707
Great, another man-hater topic.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.544
- I can't take any more.
- I mean, get over it.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.341
- Pick up the tempo, quasimodo.
- Leave her alone, Alina.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.941
Oh! God, I didn't mean you. Off you go.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.359
Sorry.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.414
Hey there! What are you doing here?

15:56.581 --> 15:58.040
You hungry?

15:58.916 --> 16:00.001
Okay!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.468
Tasty breakfast!

16:08.718 --> 16:10.970
Finally. God, I'm starving.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.390
I was at a shoot half the night.
I wish I could say what it was for,

16:14.557 --> 16:16.058
but it's a secret.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.977
But first things first!

16:40.625 --> 16:42.835
Is it okay to give a cat soy milk?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.844
Can cats drink soy milk?

17:11.781 --> 17:15.409
- What are you doing?
- Can you close the lid, please?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.204
Please.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.080
Don't you have parents?

17:25.670 --> 17:29.632
- What if the garbage truck comes?
- They come Thursdays at 10 am.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.476
Okay.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.568
Hello, everyone. I have some news.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.236
There's a new ad out.

17:50.403 --> 17:54.740
I'm so proud to have been part of the
"perfectly strong" family for so long. So:

17:56.492 --> 17:58.327
And... swipe up! Have fun.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.498
Our "perfectly strong" campaign
is all about being authentic.

18:02.665 --> 18:06.836
We wanted real faces. It's all real.
That's the most important thing.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.983
Hey, you! Excuse me!

18:29.233 --> 18:31.152
Can you throw me the ball, please?

18:38.576 --> 18:41.621
"I make my own baby food,
even though I work full time.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.206
"And I pluck daisies with my coochie."

18:44.832 --> 18:47.335
You spend too much time
with braindead people.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.547
Forget those mommy groups. This is what
I meant, you're in a relationship trap.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.426
The only fan of your life is evolution.
It's doing fist pumps.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.345
You need to go back to work.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.096
Wait a second. Here.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.265
Hanno. Great guy. Shame he's gay.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.933
He works in one of those...

19:03.100 --> 19:06.270
Consultancy type things.
Like you did before. A firm.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.064
They want to hire women.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.150
Then it won't be such a long break
as it was with...

19:11.901 --> 19:14.111
Piet. You're welcome.

19:14.278 --> 19:18.532
How would that work? Milan has so much
stress at work, and now this promotion...

19:18.699 --> 19:21.452
Women have to make demands,
or nothing ever happens.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.579
Oh, god. I wasn't even happy for him.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.581
Hello?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.083
Focus!

19:27.750 --> 19:31.671
- It's a financial decision too.
- To stay financially dependent on him?

19:31.921 --> 19:34.215
It's not so simple.
Families stick together.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.592
Speaking of which, had any sex recently?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.929
How can we? I've got kids clinging to me,

19:40.179 --> 19:43.474
I'm tired. I don't have time to exercise.
I feel fat and ugly...

19:43.641 --> 19:45.601
I've turned into an old mom.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.270
So stop behaving like one.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.411
Look, there's daddy!

20:03.577 --> 20:05.496
We're going to surprise him!

20:41.115 --> 20:42.116
Shit.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.130
Sorry, I just drank
half a gallon of water.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.224
- Last time she was smaller, right?
- A good half an inch.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.893
Sorry. Like I said,
I drank loads of water.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.396
- Waist 25".
- We need to alter her comp card.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.731
Okay.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.151
Julie, "perfectly strong" didn't renew.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.778
What?

22:00.945 --> 22:02.780
But... why? Did they say?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.282
Your look isn't in.
Even the commercial stuff

22:05.449 --> 22:07.743
is about uniqueness now,
it's just not you.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.663
It's been stagnating too long.
We need a new strategy.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.623
- Okay.
- You take four weeks out,

22:12.790 --> 22:15.501
get a personal trainer,
then we go to the b market.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.212
Let's see if I find something
for you there.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.173
That's our next step.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.718
I'm not ready to do catalogue shoots,
I want to be on a catwalk.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.387
A catwalk, Julie.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.682
Everyone wants that.
Don't be naive, you're almost 25.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.477
- If it hasn't worked out by now, it won't.
- I can do it. I'll lose weight.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.437
I'll go where you send me.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.439
Just let me try, please.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.656
Fine, if you like. Let's try again.

22:45.823 --> 22:49.577
A scout from the Asian market is coming
on Friday. Maybe they'll take you.

22:49.743 --> 22:53.539
- But your measurements need to go down.
- I can do that by Friday, I promise.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.418
Don't get lazy now.
This is your last chance, Julie.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.378
Thank you, gabo.

23:00.421 --> 23:03.799
Hey, Natasha. Can you give me
your contact for the prescription?

23:32.953 --> 23:34.663
Are you sure this is right?

23:35.706 --> 23:37.583
What, are you a doctor now?

23:38.292 --> 23:41.420
No, it's just that...
It's a hefty cocktail.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.589
I'm sick, asshole.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.049
Okay.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.010
Now I have to listen to your shit?
You don't know me.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.012
Right, sorry.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.515
Scan the prescription, hand out the drugs.
It can't be that hard.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.103
Unbelievable.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.780
- Pom-pom?
- I'm in the kitchen.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.331
What's that?

24:18.082 --> 24:20.501
So you don't burn your fingers anymore.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.422
What's all this? What's the occasion?

24:26.840 --> 24:30.678
I just thought now you're not working,
every day is a special occasion.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.413
What's wrong?

25:00.791 --> 25:02.126
Nothing.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.336
You're acting strange.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.923
I'd like to do a dance course with you.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.886
A what?

25:13.137 --> 25:15.973
I think it's important
for us to do something together.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.476
We're always doing things together.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.938
You barely look at me anymore.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.942
Oh, come on. Of course I look at you.
You're right there.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.490
Tango.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.493
It's already paid for.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.209
Is it too late to cancel?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.545
It starts on Wednesday.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.577
I'll be right there, honey. It's okay!

26:22.247 --> 26:23.457
Shit.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.709
I'll be right there, honey. It's okay.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.005
Shit.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.594
Oh, god...

27:14.424 --> 27:16.009
Shit, shit, shit...

27:31.024 --> 27:34.069
Visual representations of bodies
have always been used

27:34.319 --> 27:36.029
to create an ideal standard.

27:37.030 --> 27:40.367
It has never been so detailed
and precise as it is today.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.537
I want us to do an experiment.
Everyone take a pen,

27:44.663 --> 27:46.582
and draw a picture about yourself.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.924
Color the things you like red.

28:09.271 --> 28:12.858
Now take a blue pen
and color everything you don't like blue.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.627
Alina, what came to mind
for your self-portrait?

28:32.669 --> 28:35.172
Yeah... I colored my hair red,

28:35.339 --> 28:36.882
and my lips.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.635
Yeah. And the rest is blue.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.054
Your ass is totally red too.

28:44.014 --> 28:47.100
- Tim, what did you color red?
- Everything. I am red!

28:48.268 --> 28:49.770
Congratulations.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.480
Asian, you're filming?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.982
Great idea. Please do it all week.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.362
Did anyone draw something
that has nothing to do with looks?

29:05.160 --> 29:08.914
Interesting, isn't it?
That you immediately think of your looks.

29:09.581 --> 29:14.211
Let's take that idea further.
Our self-image determines our self-esteem.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.214
If it only
includes our outward appearance,

29:17.756 --> 29:20.759
that means our looks determine our worth.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.804
But are your looks all there is to you?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.128
Hey, you!

30:12.352 --> 30:14.396
Sorry, I...

30:15.480 --> 30:17.357
I wanted to, to...

30:17.816 --> 30:20.736
The website says to just drop by.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.739
Ever held a baseball bat before?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.159
A long time ago, as a little kid.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.454
- What's your name?
- Leyla.

30:32.622 --> 30:33.790
Okay then.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.213
Change.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.246
Wow!

31:13.413 --> 31:14.915
Center field!

31:15.665 --> 31:16.792
Hallelujah.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.088
Okay then.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.563
- Ah, the girl from the dumpster.
- Have you seen my cat?

31:44.111 --> 31:46.905
- That's a cat.
- It's my cat.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.574
She's not yours.
She belongs to the building.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.502
She has diarrhea. Can you help me?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.927
I have a dad,
but he's looking after my little brother.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.429
Okay.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.436
- This is silly.
- What? Everything's fine.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.780
The connection in tango
isn't a matter for the head.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.784
In tango, the connection
is between our hearts.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.339
The man leads, the woman follows.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.931
If the man rushes, the connection breaks.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.230
If the woman doesn't pay attention...

33:05.275 --> 33:06.943
The connection breaks.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.362
We have to be mindful of one another.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.323
It's an interplay

33:11.490 --> 33:13.867
of attraction and distance.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.036
Love,

33:17.412 --> 33:18.622
deske,

33:20.665 --> 33:21.958
jealousy

33:26.421 --> 33:27.797
and trust.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.092
It's the dance of life.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.928
Everyone can tango.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.975
- May I?
- God, no. I can't.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.525
Just concentrate
on the connection between us.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.485
Step...

33:49.236 --> 33:50.737
That's it.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.949
And... step!

33:56.159 --> 33:57.827
And go.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.270
Free your minds, connect your hearts

34:23.520 --> 34:25.272
and dance with feeling.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.400
- That's tango.
- What nonsense. Come on, we're leaving.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.777
I can't listen to this rubbish any longer.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.696
It's ridiculous.

34:34.114 --> 34:38.451
- Sorry, I... he's not feeling well.
- It's okay.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.428
What nonsense.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.274
Have a nice evening, miss Schiller.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.942
Excuse me.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.279
- You said you're good with cars?
- Yes.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.616
Can you... push?

35:45.435 --> 35:46.519
Wait.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.480
Wait, before I forget.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.149
This is just about sex.
Just this one time.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.400
Okay?

35:57.572 --> 35:58.615
What?

35:59.616 --> 36:03.078
I don't want to ruin the mood,
but while we're on the topic...

36:03.703 --> 36:05.830
One-off sex just isn't me.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.540
Sorry.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.627
Oh, right.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.426
Okay. Then...

36:19.302 --> 36:21.012
I'm sorry.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.390
Okay.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.558
Okay.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.480
- Have a nice evening.
- You too.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.567
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.089
- What is that?
- Makeup.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.591
It gives your skin an even tone.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.096
And this one?

37:03.847 --> 37:05.432
That's for your cheeks.

37:09.394 --> 37:13.148
- Is that for your lips?
- Toni, stop that. I have to concentrate.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.450
Why do you wear makeup?

37:23.616 --> 37:26.578
No idea. It's just what women do.
Doesn't your mom wear it?

37:27.120 --> 37:29.080
My mommy's in heaven.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.647
Come here, I'll do it for you.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.152
Okay.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.941
- Is that okay?
- Yes, everything's okay.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.235
- Does it hurt?
- No, only a little.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.112
- Keep going.
- Okay.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.492
Does it feel different?

39:29.951 --> 39:32.161
- I... I don't think so.
- Okay.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.550
Sorry, I didn't... that was just...

39:45.717 --> 39:48.386
- It was just air, it came from...
- It's okay.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.485
Oh, god.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.615
What's wrong?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.828
It's no big deal.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.424
Oh, come on. It's normal.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.260
Normal that after having two kids,
my vagina farts?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.346
Real sexy.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.973
But they're two adorable children.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.488
Come on, Sonja, feed her.
Just this once, please.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.824
- We have to stick to it now.
- And I have to sleep.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.869
- I want to sleep through the night.
- But I have to work.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.497
Right, I forgot.
I'm on a maternity holiday.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.792
I just drink coffee with my friends
and my adorable kids.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.171
Mommy.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.761
Come on, I'll put you back to bed.

42:20.580 --> 42:21.789
Leyla?

43:27.438 --> 43:29.649
- Morning.
- Good morning.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.902
What are you doing here?

43:33.903 --> 43:36.739
You were snoring too loudly again.
I couldn't sleep.

43:40.159 --> 43:42.286
- It's after ten o'clock.
- What?

43:42.453 --> 43:44.205
Why didn't you wake me earlier?

43:44.372 --> 43:49.418
- The store won't go broke if you're late.
- Right, wolfi. Everything I do is silly.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.137
Okay, great.

44:00.179 --> 44:03.558
Liposuction would definitely be an option
in this area.

44:04.267 --> 44:07.478
We could help out a little here too.

44:07.645 --> 44:11.858
The tummy tuck scar would be down here.
But don't worry, this kind of

44:12.024 --> 44:15.194
reconstructive surgery is routine.
We can fix it.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.613
- We talked about the breast lift.
- Yes.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.032
We offer it with or without implants.

44:20.199 --> 44:23.911
But we have to wait three to six
months after you stop breastfeeding.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.706
And, um... what about the...

44:26.873 --> 44:28.291
Love channel?

44:28.457 --> 44:30.334
- A vaginal tightening?
- Yes.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.588
Can you do that too?
Or is it more of a muscular thing?

44:34.130 --> 44:38.092
You can get dressed.
We don't offer vaginal tightening surgery.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.136
I consider it dubious.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.680
We simply don't know the risks yet.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.516
But there are less invasive procedures.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.602
Like the thermal method.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.062
How does that work?

44:50.229 --> 44:53.232
We take a device
which looks a bit like a vibrator.

44:53.399 --> 44:57.320
It's inserted, and then we carry out
a controlled burning inside.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.947
Of course, these procedures

45:00.198 --> 45:02.033
involve some temporary pain,

45:02.200 --> 45:05.661
but nothing which wouldn't usually subside
after a few weeks.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.789
Take some time to think it over.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.918
We can help put things right again

45:12.084 --> 45:14.295
so that you can enjoy motherhood.

45:14.545 --> 45:15.922
Price: From 7,900 Euros

45:16.088 --> 45:17.548
our aim is always

45:17.715 --> 45:19.926
to make you feel great again.

45:21.802 --> 45:22.970
Okay.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.808
Yes, Milan. I need 7,900 Euros to...

45:27.975 --> 45:29.852
To make me feel great again.

45:30.311 --> 45:31.896
No, no.

45:33.105 --> 45:36.984
I just need it, okay? It's none
of your business, I don't need permission.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.862
Shit. We'll be home in a minute.
It's okay.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.158
Yeah, yeah. Are you so busy?
Is the world too slow for you?

45:44.325 --> 45:46.619
Don't want to be late for the red light?

45:47.453 --> 45:48.704
Yeah.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.878
Yes. You're so hungry, aren't you?

45:57.046 --> 45:59.632
Come on, honey. Yes, I know.

46:00.633 --> 46:02.093
It's okay.

46:02.802 --> 46:03.970
What?

46:06.597 --> 46:07.807
Hello?

46:08.683 --> 46:11.269
About the interview? Yes, hello. Yes!

46:11.435 --> 46:13.813
Yes, that's right.
Thanks for calling back.

46:13.980 --> 46:17.024
Yes, I got your name from Vicky...
From Victoria Schiller.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.526
Yes, great.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.194
Yes. Tomorrow?

46:20.987 --> 46:23.531
Tomorrow... yes, that's no problem.

46:23.698 --> 46:26.701
Tomorrow at 8.30 am. Okay then.
Thank you very much.

46:26.867 --> 46:29.870
I look forward to it. See you soon, bye.
Thank you, bye!

46:30.037 --> 46:31.289
Yes!

46:32.456 --> 46:36.877
You drew a self-portrait with the things
you like and dislike about yourselves.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.713
The renaissance

46:38.879 --> 46:42.174
saw the first great golden age
of portrait painting.

46:43.134 --> 46:47.555
It was about showing people
for who they are. What defines them.

46:47.722 --> 46:50.933
This was often symbolized by an object.

46:53.853 --> 46:56.355
Leyla, what would you say defines Mia?

46:57.106 --> 46:58.482
Why Leyla?

46:58.649 --> 47:01.152
I don't think she talks.
She's mute or something.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.446
- This'll take a while.
- She never speaks.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.744
Well, I think...

47:10.202 --> 47:12.371
Mia really understands people.

47:12.913 --> 47:15.958
Somehow, she's really good
at talking to people.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.419
And she's fair.

47:18.586 --> 47:20.254
Most of the time.

47:25.885 --> 47:28.888
Fascinating, isn't it?
How much people can see.

47:29.805 --> 47:33.768
For the next class, I want you
to find out what defines you.

47:33.934 --> 47:35.686
What you're good at,

47:35.853 --> 47:38.064
what you're interested in.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.857
What's your object?

47:45.571 --> 47:47.740
Okay, I'm prepared to offer sex two times.

47:47.907 --> 47:50.076
- You liked the watermelon?
- Yes.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.411
Okay. Sex two times and one date.

47:53.954 --> 47:55.623
Okay, if we have to.

48:13.724 --> 48:14.809
Hello.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.277
So, you'd like to cancel the course?

48:27.363 --> 48:29.281
Can I take the course alone?

48:35.121 --> 48:36.997
With feeling!

48:38.165 --> 48:41.419
On five, men, put your feet together,
shift your weight.

48:41.669 --> 48:44.130
And on five, the women cross.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.423
Again!

48:50.261 --> 48:52.847
Kick up your heels, ladies.
Go, go, go! Heels up!

48:53.097 --> 48:54.682
And back again!

48:55.307 --> 48:57.476
Faster! Carlotta, heels up!

48:58.227 --> 49:01.230
And shuffle right! Come on, shuffle!

49:02.314 --> 49:03.732
A bit faster!

49:03.899 --> 49:05.568
Come on, come on!

49:06.986 --> 49:08.446
Let's go, let's go.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.660
And now back, knees up!

49:14.827 --> 49:16.579
- Sorry! Are you okay?
- It's okay.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.414
Knees up!

49:19.915 --> 49:21.250
Leyla, come on!

49:21.500 --> 49:23.043
Knees up!

50:11.383 --> 50:13.260
I... I forgot something.

50:13.886 --> 50:14.970
Okay.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.577
Julie bode?

50:59.723 --> 51:01.392
Sure. Sorry.

51:46.228 --> 51:48.564
What do you mean, you can't reach her?

52:07.207 --> 52:09.335
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, mom.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.545
Have you seen my hormone tablets?

52:12.129 --> 52:13.672
I'm dying.

52:14.173 --> 52:16.800
- Where have you been?
- Study group.

52:19.553 --> 52:20.929
Yes, zaree!

52:21.180 --> 52:25.184
I wanted to ask if I could pick up
a prescription on the way.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.521
I ordered food for you, don't wait for me.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.273
Yes.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.026
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

52:34.193 --> 52:35.736
I'm on my way.

53:02.971 --> 53:06.058
- Hello, mom.
- Hello, sweetie. Come in.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.856
Everything okay?

53:14.191 --> 53:15.943
You look good.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.404
Is Milan here?

53:19.697 --> 53:21.865
Yes. He's upstairs
putting the kids to bed.

53:22.700 --> 53:25.953
I'll be away for three hours tops.
You've got milk in the fridge.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.289
I have to work, Sonja.
I have a full schedule. It's not so easy.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.668
- So take a sick day.
- I just got promoted. I have to perform.

53:32.918 --> 53:37.005
It's just this once. You always say
you want more time with the kids.

53:37.256 --> 53:38.549
I do.

53:38.716 --> 53:42.594
What's the interview for? Alba hasn't
started daycare yet. How can you work?

53:42.761 --> 53:44.972
Why me? They're not just my children.

53:46.056 --> 53:48.267
Once again, I'm the nagging mom.

53:48.434 --> 53:49.935
I didn't say that.

53:50.102 --> 53:52.396
I'd love to laugh
at your stupid jokes again.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.357
What?

54:00.028 --> 54:02.990
I hope you have enough space.
It's a little cramped.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.534
Everything's wonderful, dear.

54:07.327 --> 54:08.912
Not so much, mom. Thanks.

54:09.163 --> 54:12.166
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm not hungry. I already ate.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.126
- Of course.
- It's chicken.

54:14.293 --> 54:15.711
It's lean. I made it for you.

54:15.878 --> 54:18.380
Leave her be, frauke.
The kids are grown up.

54:24.428 --> 54:26.930
Sorry, mom.
I have a lot of castings at the moment.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.348
I need to be in shape.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.350
You're already pretty enough.

54:31.393 --> 54:33.812
Milan, that's great news.

54:34.938 --> 54:37.357
Congratulations on the promotion.

54:38.567 --> 54:40.652
Thanks, dad. But it's no big deal.

54:40.819 --> 54:43.363
Nonsense. You've earned it.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.866
You've been working really hard.

54:46.617 --> 54:48.368
Let's drink to that.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.830
Maybe you can finally buy your own place.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.084
A house with a garden
is great for a family.

54:56.752 --> 54:59.004
That was always important for me.

54:59.254 --> 55:01.131
I know. I'm trying.

55:02.174 --> 55:04.176
But that's clearly not enough.

55:05.177 --> 55:07.054
- Yeah, right.
- Pass it along.

55:08.597 --> 55:10.224
And why not?

55:14.853 --> 55:17.272
Would changing my look be an option?

55:20.776 --> 55:22.027
Okay.

55:22.194 --> 55:23.821
Right, I understand.

55:28.075 --> 55:29.910
So now it's catalogues...

55:36.583 --> 55:38.460
Okay then... yes.

55:53.392 --> 55:56.895
- I thought you enjoyed it.
- Enjoy? It's not a hobby.

55:57.062 --> 56:00.941
I keep telling you that if you want
to go out, just say. I can help out.

56:01.108 --> 56:04.278
- How nice of you, helping me with my kids.
- Here we go again.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.822
Right, shall we?

56:09.116 --> 56:10.284
Sorry.

56:13.328 --> 56:16.206
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything's great.

56:20.419 --> 56:22.713
Right, then. Bon appetit.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.716
- I hope it's all okay.
- Of course it is.

56:31.597 --> 56:34.266
I do a lot as well. But I also have a job.

56:34.683 --> 56:36.602
I earn the money, Sonja. Okay?

56:38.478 --> 56:40.314
If you insist on working now,

56:40.480 --> 56:43.233
we should have planned for it
before you got pregnant.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.777
Sorry,
but you have to cancel the interview.

56:48.030 --> 56:49.907
Is everything okay, guys?

56:52.618 --> 56:54.620
Yes, everything's fine.

56:54.786 --> 56:56.288
I'm really happy.

56:56.455 --> 56:59.333
I finally have the chance
to be more than a milk dispenser,

56:59.499 --> 57:01.752
and your forward-thinking son understands

57:02.002 --> 57:06.089
that it's his turn to look after his kids.
Sorry, frauke. I've lost my appetite.

57:13.513 --> 57:16.808
- What's going on with you two?
- Stay out of the kids' business.

57:20.687 --> 57:23.231
I went to so much trouble
and now nobody's eating.

57:23.482 --> 57:25.692
Don't get so excited.

57:33.575 --> 57:34.826
Sorry.

57:35.285 --> 57:37.454
Your mother isn't doing so well right now.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.049
Sorry for asking.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.093
It's not your fault.

57:52.511 --> 57:54.179
But now we can go clubbing.

57:54.846 --> 57:57.015
- Great idea, Julie.
- Come on, please.

57:58.558 --> 58:00.811
Please! It's been so long.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.814
Take your little sister
to a models' party.

58:05.357 --> 58:07.109
Don't be so boring.

58:51.987 --> 58:53.947
Want a beer?

58:55.282 --> 58:57.200
Your mother didn't buy any.

59:20.348 --> 59:22.309
Dance

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.141
Julie.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.191
What's wrong?

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.654
Hello. Hello. I...

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:04.739
Everything's fine.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.825
Don't worry about it.

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:18.253
Come on, go away now.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.131
Go away. I'll see you later. Off you go!

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.967
Yeah. See you later.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.600
The one in the middle, right?

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.898
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.777
Okay. Okay.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:46.239
The milk's in the fridge. The first
bottle's already warm.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.409
- I'll be back in three hours.
- Are you serious?

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.161
Bye, kiddo.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.581
Sonja, you can't just...

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:06.468
- Blast off!
- Piet, that's enough of the astronaut act.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.094
Child care

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.943
Shit.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.153
Shit.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.578
- Sonja?
- Hello!

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.038
- Hello.
- Hi!

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.415
- I'm hanno.
- Nice to meet you, hi.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.626
- Okay, right this way.
- Okay.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:47.342
And change feet.
Back, side, forward, side.

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:51.554
And change feet. Back, side...

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:55.475
I'll show you again with the music.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:02.982
Okay, okay!

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.567
Good grief.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.487
Hi. Is mom home?

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.447
Hello. She's at work.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:11.658
- Oh, right. Shit.
- What's wrong?

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:15.203
I have to go to work.
Shit, what do I do now?

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.997
- Where's Sonja?
- At an interview. Don't ask.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.208
The contact, the embrace

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.210
- gets more intense.
- Right, then.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.296
- Then... leave her here.
- The woman gets faster...

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.675
- With you?
- Don't you think I'm up to it?

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.137
Can you change a diaper?

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.222
Seriously?

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:49.571
Toni...

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.667
I brought you some sugar pasta.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.339
When school finished,
she was the first to stand up,

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.717
run quickly down the stairs and...

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:13.136
Why don't they want you anymore?

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.096
Because I don't look right.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.182
What does right look like?

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:20.560
No idea. Taller, more striking. Special.

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:27.734
And... why did you sleep on the stairs?

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.696
I don't know.
Why were you lying in the dumpster?

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:36.159
I wanted to know how my mom feels.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.661
I dug a hole in the sandbox too,

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.997
but I was too scared to get in.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.796
Is your mom in heaven too?

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.887
No, my mom's still alive.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.020
The pasta's ready!

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.992
I love sugar pasta.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.455
It's my favorite food.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.301
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.979
We waste all of our energy

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.023
on an impossible task.

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:14.484
And end up missing out on the best thing:

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.487
Finding out who we are
and taking charge of our lives.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.613
As long as we strive for an ideal,

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.741
we're distracted.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.743
We miss the movie

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:25.995
because we're caught up in the ads.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:35.421
Bring your objects next time.
We'll do our self-portraits.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.715
I'm looking forward to your stories.

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:49.977
Do you need something?

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:51.895
I'd like to renegotiate.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:54.607
Nope.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.818
Sex twice, one date. It was a good deal.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.904
But we could just keep going.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.032
Sorry, I'm the wrong person for that.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:06.244
I don't believe
in the whole relationship idea.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:12.166
What idea?

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.670
Sorry, I've just never seen it work out.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.417
-Hey.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.968
- You're new, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.684
I saw you training.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.895
You're awesome.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:15.146
Thanks.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.781
Are you coming to the team party tonight?

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:27.074
I think so.

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.242
Cool.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.203
Yeah.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:37.126
You can do as many ochos as you like.

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.462
Step. Step.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.464
Then maybe a brief pause.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:45.343
There are no rules. Just your instincts.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.602
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.270
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:58.689
- Bye, frauke.
- Bye.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:14.932
Sorry.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:46.130
Follow

01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:47.965
requested

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.974
Leon has accepted your request

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.895
Leyla?

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:04.982
Leyla!

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:14.533
What are you doing in here?

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:18.454
I'm going to a party. And so...

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:22.959
And so I wanted to see if I could maybe
borrow one of your dresses.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:30.383
Oh! Oh.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.551
Who do you want to look pretty for?

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.346
- Mom, it doesn't matter, it's...
- No!

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:39.183
Sorry, I'm just happy
that my little baby is growing up.

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.769
Oh, god.
It doesn't matter, I'll stay like this.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.855
No! Stop underselling yourself.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.691
You're a pretty girl.

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.859
I'll help you.

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:50.736
What kind of party?

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.571
It's a school thing.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.157
I only have...

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:56.993
What size are you?

01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:58.869
12? 14?

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.252
I've got a fluttery number here.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.507
Where is it?

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.726
I can't take them to daycare.
Why don't you get it?

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:25.021
How's it supposed to work?
I have early flights to catch.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.106
Yeah, so talk to your boss.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.485
I'm exhausted too, Sonja.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.612
Why this change all of a sudden?

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.032
All of a sudden?

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:41.495
Before piet, we said
I'd stay at home to start with.

01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:45.124
Then those assholes let me go
because they didn't want me part-time.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:48.502
Then came alba,
and now it's been four years.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.089
And you just assume
nothing will change for you

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:54.091
while everything changes for me.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.180
Honestly, what were you thinking?

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.060
I just assumed
that if you needed something,

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.145
you'd say something first.

01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:10.316
Great, great. So now
I'm the nagging old woman.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.276
Why do I have to ask for it?

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:15.279
Did you ask me
if you could take the promotion? No.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:19.200
But it goes without saying
that I'll pick up the slack, right?

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:21.077
All of this shit.

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:25.915
- What are you even doing?
- Washing. The washer is still broken.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:28.626
Oh, god.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.172
I can't do this anymore, Milan.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.427
What? What can't you do anymore?

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.810
I want my kids to see me smile.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.521
Come on, stop exaggerating all the time.

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:53.234
I'm going to do it.
It's a real chance for me.

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:23.472
Hey.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:28.352
- Where are you going?
- Sorry.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:32.106
I think I'm going to leave.
This dress was a really dumb idea.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:33.941
I think you look good.

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:36.986
Here.

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:39.113
I'm getting a cramp in my hand.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.531
Thanks.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.972
Oh, god. No! Oh, god. Sorry!

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:06.724
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.528
- I don't need sleep.
- Did it get worse?

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:04.448
- Yes, it's really annoying.
- Okay, and back, back...

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:07.159
Back! Ali, come forward.

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:09.578
Let's speed it up, come on.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.872
We... we can't go that way.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:13.999
What? Why not?

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:17.461
- Because... because it stinks there.
- It stinks? Why?

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:20.172
The lake. The lake is eutrophied.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:23.133
- Eutro what? What lake?
- Eutrophied. Heidi, please!

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.061
Okay, yes.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.105
Okay, I see.

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.107
Yes, okay.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:51.161
Mom

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.172
Shit, shit, shit...

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.384
Hair removal cream

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:54.136
which one gives me a rash again?

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.598
It doesn't matter.
I'll never have sex again anyway.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:01.101
Sonja, stop whining.
You have to show a bit of stamina.

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:04.897
How are you going to get out of the trap
if you keep giving up?

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:08.400
It's just so much.
How can one person do it all?

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:10.903
Maybe people change when they have kids.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.196
Yes.

01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:14.531
Women do.
Men just keep living their lives.

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:16.992
Give the feminist crap a rest.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:19.453
- I'm not "women".
- All right...

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:22.414
Being a mom is tough work.
It just isn't paid.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:25.542
If men did it,
it'd be the best paid job in the world.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.711
You think so?

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:29.755
What?

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:34.176
Do you think Milan has it better than you?
Would you prefer to swap?

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.136
What?

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:41.141
Would you give up
your life in exchange for his?

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:48.440
You don't have the slightest idea, Vicky.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.692
Yeah, okay.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:55.113
- I'm trying to help, Sonja.
- More pressure doesn't help.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.116
"You have to work more.
You have to have sex."

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.869
"You have to accept your body."

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:03.539
But I'm not okay with my body.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.707
I want my proper body back.

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:10.754
- Your proper body?
- Yes, this one's a wreck. Look.

01:24:15.259 --> 01:24:18.053
What's that?
Did you go to a plastic surgeon?

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.559
Yes. It's my body.
I can do what I want with it.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.352
That's what you want, right?

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:29.773
That's emancipation.
If I want new tits, then I'll buy some.

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.195
Shit.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.447
Come on. Get down. Get down, please.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.533
Come with me. Come on.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:42.536
- Come on.
- What are you doing? I'm carrying a baby.

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.329
Just come, please.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.838
- What was that about?
- Nothing. Do you have cash on you?

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:54.047
Vicky!

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.847
- Everything good with you?
- Yeah. Yeah...

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:04.349
I'm good. I have to... I'm in a hurry.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:07.227
Two packs of hair removal cream.
Will that be all?

01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:08.562
Yes.

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.230
See you tomorrow.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.190
See you.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:13.775
11.70, please.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:16.778
Okay.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:20.324
Thank you.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.244
Vicky?

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:27.623
Vicky!

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.631
Vicky!

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.758
He's a colleague.

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:44.264
- Vicky!
- My students would call him my fuck boy.

01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:53.190
No way! David Ortiz, of course.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:54.691
What?

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:56.735
My dad watched all his games.

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.654
He was his hero.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:14.461
I have to... it's really late,
I have to go home.

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:18.048
- What? I didn't want to... did I...
- No, no. It's fine, really.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.467
I just have to feed the cat.

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.066
You're so brave!
I'm getting incredible feedback.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:39.319
Everyone loves your new look.
You look so confident.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:42.406
- They want you to do an editorial.
- What?

01:26:42.656 --> 01:26:44.408
- Really?
- Yes.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:48.578
It's great, just great.
Very edgy and strong.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:51.415
You're in great shape. You did great.

01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:56.169
We'll push this look,
and maybe even get you onto the catwalk.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:58.880
Hello?
Don't forget social media. Do a story.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.883
Something emotional about yourself.
Which airport?

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.719
Okay, I will.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:08.098
Julie? Turn around again.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:19.901
I don't have a cat.

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:25.490
We could just watch a series.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.286
- Mom?
- I'm here.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:37.252
- What happened to you?
- What's this?

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:40.255
- Where's your hair?
- What are you doing here?

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:43.341
I... I tried calling you. I thought I'd...

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.596
- Why don't you have any hair?
- Why are you packing up my room?

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:51.475
I just thought I'd like
a room for myself. And...

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:53.852
Have you lost your mind?

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:56.062
Couldn't you ask first?

01:27:57.564 --> 01:27:59.232
Don't take that tone with me.

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:02.778
You don't respond to my calls.
You're never here anyway.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.906
Why not take Milan's room?
Don't I matter anymore?

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:09.493
I see. I'm just stupid little Julie.
I get it.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:12.078
- That's not true, Julie.
- This is my room!

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.873
What do you need it for,
stress-relief pottery?

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.209
You do nothing all fucking day anyway.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:19.753
That's enough.

01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:22.088
Don't take that tone with me.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:24.591
I'm your mother. Show some respect.

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.346
I gave up everything for you kids.
I was always there for you.

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:33.141
I cooked and washed, healed your wounds
and suffered sleepless nights.

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:35.811
Until there was nothing left of me.

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:38.897
It's enough! Do you see?

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.483
It's enough! It's my turn now!

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.193
I want something for myself!

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:46.947
It's my right. I'm not just a doormat
to wipe your feet on,

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:49.658
who nobody respects.
Get out of here! Get out!

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.326
Okay, fine.

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:53.245
You've lost your mind.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:29.239
- Not today, Toni.
- But...

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:33.076
I said no! I don't have time
for your shit right now. Understood?

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.963
Yeah, get out!

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:51.803
Mommy.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:54.598
Piet, why are you still awake?

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:56.975
Can you read me a story?

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:04.065
Okay. Okay. Come on.

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:06.359
"The doctor fixes gitti's leg.

01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:09.613
After her surgery,
the nurse brings her back to her room.

01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:11.907
Her mom sleeps there with here.

01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:15.285
In the evening, daddy comes to visit."

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:22.000
Exactly. There it is.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:23.877
In writing.

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:26.463
It explains everything perfectly.

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:29.049
All men are doctors.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:33.011
And the women are just nurses.
They clean up the poo.

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:36.556
And daddy only comes
in the evening, because he works.

01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:38.475
Not like mom.

01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:41.728
She can stay all day, relaxed and caring.

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:43.188
By choice.

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:46.775
Because she has nothing else to do
with her life. It's important

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:50.028
that you understand how it all works
from an early age.

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:52.197
Otherwise it gets all messed up.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.951
That's why they write it out so clearly
in children's books,

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:59.621
so it's all clear.
Remember that, do you understand?

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:55.635
Aren't you coming to bed?

01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:57.554
No, I have to finish this.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:03.810
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.609
We're the... linas!

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.237
You can book us
for humorous stress relief.

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:18.366
I've made a bunch of short films
with this software here.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:21.536
It's, like, my talent.
So I wanted to show you something.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:23.580
Check me out, bro, without a doubt, yo

01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:25.498
one day, this guy'll be number one.

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:30.378
- I can beatbox too.
- Shit, now the software has crashed.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:33.131
This could take a while.
Can I show you later?

01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:37.218
Yeah. These are my clubs.
I practiced every day.

01:32:40.263 --> 01:32:42.807
When I did the spin, my kneecap...

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:45.518
Kind of got stuck at the front.

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:49.355
And... since then,
I just don't know anymore.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:16.466
My dad always wanted
to be a baseball player.

01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:18.927
But... he wasn't good enough.

01:33:20.887 --> 01:33:23.598
He dragged me and my mom
to loads of games.

01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:25.934
It was really great.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:30.605
But then he left us
and went back to america.

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:33.483
To his new family.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.069
My mom sent me to ballet classes.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.822
She wanted me to do something else. But...

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:40.740
I wasn't any good at it.

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:44.744
Now I play baseball again.

01:33:44.911 --> 01:33:47.247
I have strong shoulders. You need them.

01:34:04.848 --> 01:34:07.684
Hey, miss Schiller. What's your object?

01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:09.811
- My object?
- Yeah.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:12.522
In my case, it's more of a mosaic.

01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:26.119
Fuck boy?

01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:32.000
What?

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:38.214
You know what? I really like you,
and you like me too.

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:42.844
That doesn't happen often.
And when it does, you don't just run away.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:48.725
It doesn't happen often?

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:54.147
Sorry, but that's such a clichÃ©.

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:58.151
Right now, within a three mile radius,

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.904
20,000 people are saying
those words to each other.

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:04.741
And they all think
they're really special and chosen.

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:08.828
After four months, when
the chosen-one hormone leaves the body,

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:12.540
they all notice, whoops!
They're all caught up with one another.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:15.168
Nobody can see out, and nothing's fun.

01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:18.796
And while the "relationship"
consumes everything,

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:21.466
life in all its glory
passes behind your back.

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:24.636
But you're not allowed to join in,
because you're too busy

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:27.805
standing too close to someone else,
right on their feet.

01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:30.767
And they all hurt each other.
That's a fact.

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.811
Yet I still like standing here with you.

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:35.605
It feels good.

01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:38.858
That's a fact too.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.819
And I don't feel the slightest need
to get away from you

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:46.407
just because we might turn into a cliche
one day. Sometimes that can be a gift.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:49.744
But if you won't open the gift,
neither can I.

01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:52.121
And that... that's unfair!

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.463
Listen, I don't know...

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:02.882
My strengths lie elsewhere.

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:06.636
I'm good at other things.
Not at love, at other things.

01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:08.721
- But you already do.
- What?

01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:12.433
You already love me.

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.482
Are you crazy?

01:36:24.862 --> 01:36:26.614
You don't get to say that.

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:29.117
Who would say a thing like that? God!

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:05.695
Piet! Piet!

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.700
Come on. That's enough bath time now.

01:37:11.951 --> 01:37:13.036
Right.

01:37:13.619 --> 01:37:15.121
Jeez.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:23.671
Mommy, you're broken there.

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:26.341
- Where?
- There.

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.387
That's right.

01:37:31.554 --> 01:37:33.348
Should I make it better?

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:36.893
Okay, quickly.
But then you're going to bed.

01:37:39.312 --> 01:37:41.647
Right. Where does it hurt?

01:37:43.649 --> 01:37:45.568
Here, here, and here.

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:32.615
Don't worry, it will all be fine.

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:39.664
Feeling better?

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.544
Why are you crying then, mom?

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.921
It's nothing, everything's okay.

01:38:47.547 --> 01:38:49.424
So then why are you crying?

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.889
- I just forgot something.
- What did you forget?

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:04.814
I forgot that you kids
were inside there once.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:08.568
Did we make you all broken?

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:11.446
Come here.

01:39:13.906 --> 01:39:17.368
You're the best, most wonderful
and important thing in the world.

01:39:17.535 --> 01:39:18.661
Okay.

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:30.631
Beautiful!

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.800
More of the cold shoulder.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.387
Yes, awesome.

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:37.763
Great.

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:41.642
Hey, do you need a break?
You seem low on energy.

01:39:41.893 --> 01:39:43.311
No, sorry, I'm fine.

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:16.010
And now more condescending.

01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:20.181
Yes, awesome. Great.

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:22.266
Seductive!

01:40:57.176 --> 01:40:58.594
You look pretty.

01:40:59.303 --> 01:41:01.138
Piet wanted to paint.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.599
Am I an egotistical asshole hermit?

01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:08.020
You're not an egotistical asshole hermit.
But you can be annoying.

01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:10.982
- Okay, thanks.
- No problem, don't mention it.

01:41:20.658 --> 01:41:22.868
If that stupid surgery makes you happy,

01:41:23.035 --> 01:41:25.371
I'll go with you and be there for you.

01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:28.332
I guess you know I'd rather help
in some other way, but...

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:31.460
You're my family, and I love you.

01:41:34.171 --> 01:41:35.881
I love you too.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:39.552
- I don't want the surgery.
- Really? Oh, thank god!

01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:43.306
I'd have stuck that stupid doctor's
scalpel in his chest...

01:41:44.557 --> 01:41:46.642
I don't know if that's legal.

01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:50.563
It's a gray area.

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.276
- Won't you ask me in?
- Yes.

01:41:57.361 --> 01:42:01.032
- Alba and piet are in here.
- Okay, I'll go this way then.

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.162
- Leyla, are you there?
- Shit.

01:42:06.329 --> 01:42:08.372
- Is your stuff downstairs?
- Yes, why?

01:42:08.539 --> 01:42:11.125
- Shit. Get up, now!
- But we're not doing anything.

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:13.002
Why is she...?

01:42:15.087 --> 01:42:17.298
What's going on? What's this?

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:19.800
- Who's this?
- Hi.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.595
Leon brabandt. I play baseball with Leyla.

01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:25.640
Mom...

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:27.975
Baseball?

01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:30.561
- Get out.
- What? Why?

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:32.897
- I said get out.
- He's not going.

01:42:33.064 --> 01:42:37.360
- It's okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- You won't see her tomorrow. It's over.

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.570
Come on, let's go.

01:42:40.613 --> 01:42:42.365
Are you serious, Leyla?

01:42:43.407 --> 01:42:44.742
Baseball?

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:47.119
You're a baseball player?

01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:52.917
Sorry.

01:42:55.461 --> 01:42:58.381
You think your dad
will take an interest in you again?

01:42:58.547 --> 01:43:02.551
He abandoned us for his new fucking family
and his new fucking kids.

01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:05.346
He doesn't give a shit about us.
Don't forget that.

01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:08.641
Of course not. How could I?

01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:12.061
How could I forget it?
I see him every day in the mirror.

01:43:12.228 --> 01:43:14.730
I see how you look at me. I get it, okay?

01:43:14.897 --> 01:43:17.441
I know I'm not good enough for you.
But you know what?

01:43:17.608 --> 01:43:18.859
I don't care.

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.904
I don't have to do what you want
or be who you want.

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:23.989
I just want to be me.

01:43:41.507 --> 01:43:44.135
Hello, tweety. Where did you come from?

01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:06.115
Oh, shit.

01:44:06.282 --> 01:44:07.992
Toni, go inside.

01:44:15.291 --> 01:44:17.418
Toni, look after your brother.

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.768
I love dirty dancing!

01:44:36.645 --> 01:44:39.023
He's such a great dancer.

01:44:42.818 --> 01:44:45.154
It's not about how well he dances.

01:44:46.238 --> 01:44:48.157
Why does nobody get it?

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.495
I've never met anyone who can love
the way Johnny does.

01:44:52.661 --> 01:44:54.955
He just wants her to be free.

01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:06.550
Sure, but you also just wish
you could be in her place for that lift.

01:45:17.937 --> 01:45:19.730
My mother just called.

01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:22.066
It's Julie.

01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:40.292
How... how does it look?

01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:45.923
She was revived,
but her blood pressure keeps dropping.

01:45:46.090 --> 01:45:47.758
She's very weak.

01:45:48.467 --> 01:45:50.219
And she isn't...

01:45:51.971 --> 01:45:53.681
She isn't stable yet.

01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:26.213
Oh, god! Oh, no.

01:46:30.509 --> 01:46:33.846
"Gitti helps mom
with the spring cleaning." Okay...

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:04.293
You can see her now.

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:00.140
I didn't see it, Sonja.

01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:05.145
It's not your fault, Milan.

01:48:09.525 --> 01:48:11.151
I wasn't there.

01:48:14.863 --> 01:48:16.907
I'm never really there anymore.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:28.293
I don't know what we're doing, Sonja.

01:48:35.092 --> 01:48:36.927
I don't want to lose us.

01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:44.309
Me neither.

01:49:33.484 --> 01:49:35.402
I kissed another man.

01:49:40.491 --> 01:49:41.575
What?

01:49:50.876 --> 01:49:52.586
Okay. And now?

01:49:54.213 --> 01:49:56.006
Are you feeling better now?

01:49:58.008 --> 01:49:59.635
Are you done?

01:50:07.226 --> 01:50:10.104
Your romantic daydreams
have to stop, frauke.

01:50:11.814 --> 01:50:14.149
We need to pull ourselves together.

01:50:15.859 --> 01:50:17.903
You're not 20 anymore.

01:50:19.613 --> 01:50:22.074
I'm not 80, either. I'm not dead yet.

01:50:24.827 --> 01:50:26.662
And I'm not happy, wolfi.

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:32.376
Are you leaving me?

01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:37.589
We've been apart for a long time.

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:45.639
I'm going back to the hospital, to Julie.

01:50:46.557 --> 01:50:48.267
I want to be with her

01:50:49.226 --> 01:50:50.978
when she wakes up.

01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:53.874
Good job girl! You rock!
Get well soon. Love, gabo.

01:52:09.973 --> 01:52:11.099
Breakfast.

01:52:54.268 --> 01:52:56.395
But it's so little.

01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:59.898
Yeah, that's just how it looks
if we both work part-time.

01:53:00.065 --> 01:53:03.819
But can we stay in this apartment?
Or is that too expensive too?

01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:05.821
We'll manage it.

01:53:06.738 --> 01:53:08.615
This year, anyway.

01:53:11.785 --> 01:53:13.870
We'll just have to skip a holiday.

01:53:15.163 --> 01:53:17.165
You have to start dyeing your own hair.

01:53:17.332 --> 01:53:21.295
You have to buy cheap shirts and iron
them yourself. Dry cleaning is expensive!

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:23.338
We're going to be poor.

01:53:23.505 --> 01:53:25.048
And ugly.

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:27.718
But we have time.

01:53:30.012 --> 01:53:31.722
And we're together.

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.351
And we love each other.

01:53:54.369 --> 01:53:56.621
- Oh, thank you.
- Shut up.

01:54:05.547 --> 01:54:07.591
- Piet!
- No, not now...

01:54:07.841 --> 01:54:10.927
- Hey.
- The wolf eated alba's leg.

01:54:11.553 --> 01:54:13.430
Oh, no, sweetie.

01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:16.683
There aren't any wolves here.
Come here. It was just a dream.

01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:19.978
But when the forest is dark,
the wolf comes.

01:54:20.145 --> 01:54:21.772
Yes, that's when he comes.

01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:23.982
- There are no wolves here.
- Bad wolf...

01:54:26.026 --> 01:54:27.110
Milan?

01:54:28.487 --> 01:54:30.072
Are you asleep?

01:55:03.939 --> 01:55:06.900
What's important is that
you don't come to a standstill.

01:55:07.067 --> 01:55:09.986
The next runner has to recognize
the exact moment...

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.742
And should already be sprinting...

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.412
When the Baton is passed.

01:55:20.414 --> 01:55:22.207
Five laps around the field.

01:55:22.374 --> 01:55:23.917
Off you go!

01:55:50.402 --> 01:55:52.320
Oh, god! Ouch!

01:55:53.697 --> 01:55:57.242
- What was that?
- The lift. Why didn't you catch me?

01:55:57.492 --> 01:55:59.202
You have to warn me!

01:56:00.036 --> 01:56:01.496
Oh, right.

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:03.832
Do you want to be one of my objects?

01:56:04.541 --> 01:56:05.917
Okay.

01:56:06.084 --> 01:56:07.085
Why?

01:56:07.335 --> 01:56:09.796
I've been doing some calculations and...

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:12.966
On balance, more situations
are better when you're there

01:56:13.133 --> 01:56:14.801
than when you're not.

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:20.599
But I still want
to do things alone. Often.

01:56:20.849 --> 01:56:22.392
Often?

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:24.269
Often enough.

01:56:24.519 --> 01:56:25.729
Okay.

01:56:27.272 --> 01:56:28.398
Reading.

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.735
Okay.

01:56:47.375 --> 01:56:48.627
Get a room!

01:56:49.252 --> 01:56:51.171
Five more laps!

01:56:57.552 --> 01:56:58.553
Frauke!

01:57:00.096 --> 01:57:03.975
I saw you were back. I thought
it'd be better if you weren't alone.

01:57:06.019 --> 01:57:09.147
Come on, I'll pour us some wine.
Do you have some?

01:57:11.525 --> 01:57:13.276
Oh, my god.

01:57:13.443 --> 01:57:15.278
What happened here?

01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:12.836
Hey.

01:58:18.883 --> 01:58:20.635
I know you're in there.

01:58:28.602 --> 01:58:32.397
I wanted to ask if you'll
look after our cat until I'm all better.

01:58:46.453 --> 01:58:47.537
Toni.

01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:59.257
I'm sorry I scared you like that.
It won't happen again, I promise.

01:59:04.346 --> 01:59:06.431
I'm going to open it now, okay?

01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:58.775
Frauke, where shall I put the plates?

01:59:58.942 --> 02:00:00.443
On the table.

02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.237
What's bernt doing?

02:00:02.487 --> 02:00:03.988
That's nice.

02:00:04.656 --> 02:00:06.950
Oh, he's making roses.

02:00:07.117 --> 02:00:08.827
I need help!

02:00:09.744 --> 02:00:11.204
Bernt, come help.

02:00:11.371 --> 02:00:13.123
Bernt, come help.

02:00:13.832 --> 02:00:15.834
Leave me alone. I'm not done.

02:00:31.725 --> 02:00:33.059
Hi, guys.

02:00:33.309 --> 02:00:34.978
It's my birthday.

02:00:35.145 --> 02:00:36.938
I'm 25 years old.

02:00:38.523 --> 02:00:41.151
A quarter century. Crazy, right?

02:00:42.777 --> 02:00:46.322
I've spent half of it
constantly improving my body.

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:50.243
To the breaking point.

02:00:50.744 --> 02:00:53.997
My agent said to tell you something
emotional about myself.

02:00:55.123 --> 02:00:57.083
My dream, my story.

02:00:58.752 --> 02:01:00.712
So... here it is.

02:01:01.463 --> 02:01:03.214
My real story.

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:10.221
Every day, we're confronted
with what's not right about us.

02:01:10.388 --> 02:01:12.056
What we still have to achieve.

02:01:12.307 --> 02:01:15.268
What we have to optimize.
From childhood onwards.

02:01:15.518 --> 02:01:17.520
In ads, in magazines,

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:20.815
on social media, among friends, at school,

02:01:21.065 --> 02:01:23.818
in our families, in our own heads.

02:01:25.945 --> 02:01:28.364
And we believe that if we look perfect,

02:01:28.615 --> 02:01:30.241
we'll finally be happy.

02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:33.787
I can't see otherwise.

02:01:35.413 --> 02:01:36.664
You can kiss this side.

02:01:36.831 --> 02:01:40.794
Now let's hear some noise for Leyla zaree!

02:01:47.717 --> 02:01:50.345
The first pitch. She swings and misses.

02:01:51.012 --> 02:01:52.305
Strike one.

02:01:53.473 --> 02:01:57.936
We have to stop feeling bad and worrying
that other people might not like us.

02:02:05.819 --> 02:02:07.862
Just imagine.

02:02:08.029 --> 02:02:11.074
If we 'd only stop trying
to constantly improve ourselves,

02:02:11.241 --> 02:02:13.827
if it just mattered less how we look.

02:02:16.746 --> 02:02:18.706
Leyla! Leyla!

02:02:22.919 --> 02:02:25.046
What would we do with all that free energy

02:02:25.213 --> 02:02:27.131
and all that free time?

02:02:27.841 --> 02:02:29.467
Come on, girl.

02:02:33.346 --> 02:02:34.973
She hits it!

02:02:35.223 --> 02:02:36.558
Run, Leyla! Go!

02:02:36.808 --> 02:02:38.518
And she's offi

02:02:45.108 --> 02:02:46.609
Safe! Safe!

02:02:46.776 --> 02:02:50.113
The flamingos win! The flamingos win!

02:02:53.575 --> 02:02:56.077
It probably wouldn't be
our dreams that changed.

02:03:04.294 --> 02:03:06.004
But the world.

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:15.221
Spoon...

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:18.600
Put the baby monitor away, they're asleep!

02:03:18.766 --> 02:03:21.352
Maybe it's not loud enough,
or we're too far away?

02:03:21.519 --> 02:03:23.855
What, the 30 feet to the guest room?

02:03:25.648 --> 02:03:28.109
- Hey, hedgehog.
- Hey. You're the hedgehog.

02:03:28.276 --> 02:03:29.903
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:33.239
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet. Get healthy first.

02:03:34.616 --> 02:03:36.284
Hey, where were you?

02:03:36.451 --> 02:03:40.204
It was Franz's fault. He couldn't decide,
and now he looks like this.

02:03:40.371 --> 02:03:42.040
Hi. Fuck boy. Nice to meet you.

02:03:42.206 --> 02:03:44.918
- Nice to meet you.
- Still upset? Real sexy.

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:49.589
Oh, come on, please dance with me!

02:03:49.756 --> 02:03:50.840
Okay.

02:03:52.342 --> 02:03:54.844
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:07.106
What?

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:09.943
No. Absolutely not.

02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:15.323
- Hey, you can't dance at all, can you?
- Sure I can, look.

02:04:49.232 --> 02:04:50.608
Thanks.

02:05:05.456 --> 02:05:07.625
It's nice like this, without the wall.

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:11.421
Yeah.

02:05:12.672 --> 02:05:14.507
I think so too.

02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:29.840
