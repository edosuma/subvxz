01:12.572 --> 01:16.866
Did you ever have one of those days?

01:16.993 --> 01:19.994
Not one of those days. The other kind.

01:22.082 --> 01:26.459
The kind of day
where there was something in the air,

01:26.586 --> 01:29.955
something that had been
on its way for a while.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.464
Something good.

01:34.469 --> 01:38.930
And maybe, because I think about myself,
like, all the time,

01:39.057 --> 01:43.518
I was sure that
something on its way was about me.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.063
It's mine.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.292
You're up early.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.498
Did you sleep OK?

02:12.632 --> 02:16.961
JD woke me up a couple of times
but I went back to sleep.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.800
Is this what you're wearing today?

02:21.725 --> 02:24.013
Can JD come to the cemetery?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.635
- No.
- Why?

02:26.771 --> 02:28.847
Because he's a dog.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.770
Fuck her. You're coming.

02:36.906 --> 02:41.118
That's what she did.
Well, that's what she said she did.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.865
You have no respect for authority.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.914
The discipline of a fucking piss-ant.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.615
Wow, good morning to you, too.

02:49.753 --> 02:53.335
You'd make a good cop.
We were just discussing you.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.715
Were you, now?
What was the topic of discussion?

02:56.843 --> 03:00.971
My wit, my charm, my pouty lips?

03:01.097 --> 03:04.098
You quit your new job
the day after quitting at Happy Time.

03:04.225 --> 03:07.677
- The very next morning.
- Your lips are pouty.

03:07.812 --> 03:12.807
- How long did you last at the new gig?
- Less than five minutes.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.276
Got that one beat.
North London, the pizza parlour...

03:16.404 --> 03:21.743
- Not interested. It's George's day.
- What does that mean, it's my day?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.406
This is... This is not Tabasco.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.830
- Morning, Kiffany.
- How about a little breakfast?

03:28.958 --> 03:34.000
Need a little cash? Don't have a job.
Means you don't have any money.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.380
And no prospects. Just dead and stupid.

03:37.509 --> 03:41.756
I don't need your money, Rube.
I found 20 bucks today.

03:41.888 --> 03:45.423
- Save it, Georgia. Breakfast is on me.
- Sweet.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.426
Rube said it's her day,
her breakfast is on me.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.970
Thank you, Daisy.

03:52.107 --> 03:56.056
I'll have "Breakfast at Tiffany's"
with a large OJ

03:56.194 --> 04:00.607
and can you make the bacon
extra, extra crispy?

04:00.740 --> 04:03.990
- You don't eat bacon.
- I know. But Rube does.

04:04.119 --> 04:07.618
- That's the way he likes it.
- So, what, you're Rube's butt-boy?

04:07.747 --> 04:10.867
Why, did you resign?

04:11.001 --> 04:14.334
And instead of hot tea, Kiffany,
I'll have coffee.

04:14.462 --> 04:21.046
- No, make that a green tea. It's good for you.
- How about a hot cup of shut-the-fuck-up?

04:21.177 --> 04:25.341
I'm not sure you got the memo, Roxy,
but it is my day.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.344
- Nothing for me?
- Not today.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.967
That's right, not today!

04:31.771 --> 04:35.057
- Why?
- Every so often, you get one of those days.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.525
I wanted
something good to come my way.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.942
More than a free breakfast.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.322
More than 20 bucks. Just more.

04:59.924 --> 05:04.670
- I'm a good-looking guy. Am I not? Am I?
- You're fine for a white boy.

05:04.804 --> 05:10.391
Fuck "fine". I think I radiate
a certain raffish appeal. Do I not? Do I?

05:13.646 --> 05:16.102
Reaper.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.984
Too old.
You think everybody's a reaper.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.526
Maybe the women I'm attracted to
are more discerning.

05:22.655 --> 05:27.732
But as far as drawing power goes,
I've got it in spades. Have I not? Have I?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.989
- How long since you've had sex?
- With a woman.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.198
- With a woman.
- Who's alive.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.117
I have not had sex with a dead woman.
Technically.

05:37.253 --> 05:41.500
Flores? Flores? Flores para los muertos.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.049
- No, thank you.
- Flowers for the dead.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.969
- Reaper.
- Serious reaper.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.216
- How long has it been, Mason?
- A while.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.675
- How long exactly?
- A few months.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.887
- How many months?
- Fifteen!

05:55.021 --> 05:59.849
- My stars, that's pathetic.
- Jesus! Pay for it. Bang a hooker.

05:59.984 --> 06:03.816
Look, I don't know what to do.
I can't think straight.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.734
Daisy, you have to find me a woman.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.440
- Be your pimp?
- Please pimp me.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.614
- Don't you have a soul to reap?
- Yeah, here.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.950
Zulu Records.
There's hot girls in here all the time.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.458
Fuck off, man!

06:20.505 --> 06:22.379
Happy hunting.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.665
My Post-it's not until later.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.553
Let's see what kind of game you got.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.269
Hey. Morning.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.273
So, welcome to Hot Yoga. Sit.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.487
Anyone here for the first time?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.990
Hey. You lost?

06:52.120 --> 06:56.200
No. I had an appointment in the area

06:56.332 --> 06:58.954
and just wanted to see what was here.

06:59.085 --> 07:03.794
- What's your name?
- Uh, Rube.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.960
- What's yours?
- I'm Arun.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.676
- Arun Levert?
- This is my studio.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.633
Why don't you join us for class?
You're here.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.854
- I don't really do yoga.
- It doesn't matter.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.397
You're here. Be here.

07:24.611 --> 07:28.194
- I can do that.
- Good.

07:28.323 --> 07:33.744
Take off your clothes. There are extra shorts
in the cubby, OK? That's for you.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.613
OK, let's begin.

07:39.334 --> 07:44.708
Even though this job
was getting in the way of the business of living...

07:50.178 --> 07:51.756
Hello?

07:52.931 --> 07:56.382
.. there was no getting around
the costs of that business.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.842
I really needed money.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.150
No way Delores could tell me no today.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.028
It was my day.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.692
- What do you mean "no"?
- Millie.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.244
Delores, you and I were like... friends.

08:18.373 --> 08:24.209
Then you quit. And took a job from
one of our postings and quit after an hour.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.911
Five minutes.

08:27.048 --> 08:31.426
- Millie, let me tell you a story.
- OK.

08:31.553 --> 08:36.974
- Do you know who Wally Pip was?
- Is that a real person?

08:37.100 --> 08:40.054
He played for the New York Yankees.

08:40.186 --> 08:44.813
One summer day,
Wally Pip did not feel well

08:44.941 --> 08:47.776
and asked to sit out for a game.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.437
- I don't really like baseball.
- Do you know who replaced him?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.784
You ever heard of Lou Gehrig?

08:56.911 --> 09:00.280
I know there's a bad disease
named after him.

09:00.415 --> 09:04.033
Lou Gehrig played
over 2,000 straight games for them.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.502
He was known as "The Iron Horse".

09:07.630 --> 09:12.873
I don't need a Wally Pip, Millie,
and I don't need you.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.631
You're joking, right?

09:19.684 --> 09:22.306
So who's my replacement?

09:22.437 --> 09:25.224
- Who's Lou Gehrig?
- Mitchell.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.895
- Mitchell is The Iron Horse?
- Mm-hm.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.483
Oh, please, Delores,
just give me a second chance.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.367
It's Ms Herbig now.

09:41.498 --> 09:45.163
- I need my job back.
- We're done here.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.667
Line two.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.252
We're done, Wally.

09:51.383 --> 09:55.048
Oh... fucking unreal.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.967
Hello. Delores Herbig,
how may I help you?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.104
Wait.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.640
- How's it going, pretty lady?
- Fuck off.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.066
Press that down button!

10:13.196 --> 10:16.530
- That doesn't make it come faster.
- Fuck off!

10:16.658 --> 10:18.816
Murray's in shock!

10:18.952 --> 10:23.530
My neighbour said he pissed over her floor
then just collapsed!

10:23.665 --> 10:25.990
I have to get him to a hospital.

10:26.126 --> 10:30.788
- I think your husband...
- Murray's a cat, you ass-wipe.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.623
You're in no condition to drive.
Let me drive.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.333
Who are you calling an ass-wipe, ass-wipe?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.961
- Don't touch me!
- I will if I want to.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.719
Come on!

10:47.480 --> 10:50.351
Maybe you should drive.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.694
Now let's go into "eagle".

10:57.824 --> 11:00.944
Raise your hands above your head

11:01.077 --> 11:04.660
and swing them around,
wrap them together.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.707
Right elbow over left. Twist.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.794
Twist. Twist.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.459
Excellent job, Rube.

11:22.557 --> 11:27.219
- My mother is really pissed off.
- So let her be pissed off.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.390
It was her granddaughter, Joy.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.892
You know what, Clancy? I don't like her.

11:34.903 --> 11:39.861
She doesn't like me. If it were any other day
I still wouldn't wanna see her.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.158
- Sorry I brought it up.
- I don't wanna see her today.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.528
I am sorry I brought it up.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.457
Answer that phone
and I will shove it up your ass.

11:58.927 --> 12:03.423
- Hi.
- Uh, so what happens today?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.474
- What do you mean?
- What happens?

12:06.601 --> 12:10.978
Well, nothing much.
The reverend will say a prayer.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.232
- And I'm gonna say something.
- Really?

12:17.529 --> 12:20.483
And you can say something if you want to.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.406
OK.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.365
So, what are you gonna say?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.913
I'm gonna say...

12:33.211 --> 12:35.667
I can't deal with you today.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.927
I have an emergency!

12:51.396 --> 12:53.435
Sign in, please.

12:53.565 --> 12:56.056
Murray usually sees Doctor Wilson.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.980
Doctor Wilson's not in. Doctor Levy's here.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.568
Can he see us right away?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.319
Hold on, I'm new.

13:05.368 --> 13:09.580
There's a lady here
who wants to see you right away.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.206
Marcie.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.997
Marcie. I'm new. Marcie!

13:16.129 --> 13:18.702
This is a cat emergency!

13:18.840 --> 13:21.212
I'll be right back.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.842
- Come on, it probably won't be long.
- Meow, meow.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.588
Meow, meow, mister.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.928
- Excuse me. I...
- Certainly.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.181
- How's Murray doing?
- Not very good.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.270
What did you say your cat's name was?

13:47.410 --> 13:51.657
- Don't tell him, Delores.
- Murray, you hang in there, beautiful boy.

13:52.582 --> 13:56.081
You beat the Jacuzzi.
You beat the ice cream truck.

13:56.211 --> 14:00.671
- You've got seven lives left.
- What you reading?

14:00.799 --> 14:05.342
I appreciate the ride
but I think Murray and I will be fine now.

14:05.470 --> 14:09.966
- OK. Hey, are you waiting for a pet?
- Uh-huh.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.350
But if you leave
I don't know how we'll get home.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.850
I don't want to leave Murray here overnight.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.140
Well, I can stay.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.852
So, what's your pet's name?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.989
Is it a dog? Snake? Ferret?

14:27.117 --> 14:30.699
- What's your problem?
- Why aren't you sad?

14:30.870 --> 14:35.616
Maybe I am. Or maybe my mom's
boning the dude from animal control.

14:35.750 --> 14:40.993
- You're full of shit, you little punk.
- Millie, he's a child.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.714
I need the bathroom.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.630
- Don't let him touch Murray.
- Why?

14:47.762 --> 14:50.549
Just don't.

14:51.975 --> 14:56.851
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe life was flipping me off again.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.645
Maybe this wasn't my day at all.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.273
OK.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.741
Arun, could you demonstrate
the plough pose for me?

15:18.877 --> 15:21.913
- I feel my form isn't good.
- Oh, it's good.

15:22.047 --> 15:26.044
- I'd be happy to, Sandy.
- Thanks for the class.

15:32.515 --> 15:36.762
You want your calves
parallel like train tracks.

15:38.563 --> 15:42.857
My yoga teacher
used to get on my ass and stand there.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.893
He was surfing away.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.154
It's beautiful. Thanks.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.997
What just happened?

16:09.052 --> 16:11.507
You're dead.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.677
- You're kidding me.
- No.

16:16.851 --> 16:21.809
I have a neck injury. I'm not supposed
to do the plough pose. But Sandy's so hot.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.894
- You broke your neck.
- Wow.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.935
Where are my pants?

16:28.071 --> 16:32.532
- So I'm dead and nobody gives a shit.
- They don't know yet.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.494
I thought I put them in the second cubby.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.240
- No one sees me, just you.
- These aren't mine.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.414
Thanks for class, Arun.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.802
Would you like to go get some tea?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.304
Arun?

16:55.390 --> 16:58.260
- Arun?
- She wants to sleep with me.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.725
Yeah, that's gotta hurt.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.067
Hey! Shithead!

17:16.493 --> 17:21.452
Hootie & The Blowfish?
Take it and get the fuck out of here.

17:23.792 --> 17:27.625
This place is all about
the initial salvo, the opening line.

17:27.756 --> 17:32.418
Has to be clever, but at the same time
suggest an inner beauty.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.339
- D'you think you can do that?
- Yes.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.713
What's a line that's worked on you?

17:39.976 --> 17:43.060
- "I'm Gary Cooper."
- That's not gonna work for me.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.939
Yeah. Just be yourself.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.774
OK.

17:47.901 --> 17:54.069
Only smarter. Richer, more successful,
clean-shaven, and I'm guessing a bigger cock.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.606
Right.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.613
You're English. Use that to your advantage.

17:59.746 --> 18:04.740
Be James Bond.
Give them the really sexual innuendo.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.418
OK.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.127
Hi.

18:15.512 --> 18:20.637
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Or should I walk by again?

18:20.767 --> 18:26.437
Do either of you work for UPS?
I noticed you checking out my package.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.520
Nice legs. What time do they open?

18:31.653 --> 18:35.318
Hi there. Hi there. Hi... H...

18:35.448 --> 18:37.820
H... Hi there.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.206
I'm not James Bond.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.415
- What was that for?
- It looked like fun.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.170
- Was it?
- Yeah.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.505
I gotta run. Just try being yourself.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.185
- What are you looking for, sweetie?
- I don't know.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.906
OK.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.989
I wanna bring something to her grave.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.453
- Like what?
- I said I don't know.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.037
- You want help?
- No.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.758
Something of hers or something of yours?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.549
Mom.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.266
Go away.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.199
- Murray Herbig?
- We usually see Dr Wilson.

20:01.326 --> 20:05.276
He's at the zoo,
had to deliver a baby orang-utan.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.498
A breech birth. High degree of difficulty.

20:08.625 --> 20:14.959
- Murray hasn't been eating.
- Oh. Let's have a listen. OK...

20:15.090 --> 20:19.752
Hm. The heart rate is depressed,
the kidneys are a bit big.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.421
Any vomiting, unusual urination,
coughing up hairballs?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.807
- And how about the cat?
- What?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.971
A standard vet joke. I'm old school.

20:30.105 --> 20:34.731
Ha-ha-ha! That's not funny.
Look at her. That's panic.

20:36.027 --> 20:41.022
I'm sorry. Well, my guess is that
he's suffering some kind of renal failure.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.613
- Oh, my Lord.
- Something frightened him.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.077
He's not fond of being in the cat carrier.

20:49.124 --> 20:51.875
Have you ever heard someone say

20:52.002 --> 20:56.545
that mankind is the only species who
has the knowledge that he's gonna die?

20:56.673 --> 21:00.505
- Why?
- Well, Murray's very old. And he's sick.

21:00.635 --> 21:04.929
- You think cats know, too?
- Mm-hm. But I'm gonna try and treat him.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.678
I'm gonna do everything I can.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.885
OK.

21:18.153 --> 21:21.687
It's OK. Just take deep breaths.

21:21.823 --> 21:26.818
It seemed as if this day, my day,
was a bit of a mixed bag.

21:26.953 --> 21:32.030
I shouldn't have been surprised.
It's not like I was a particularly lucky girl.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.750
15 years of yoga and this is it,

21:37.881 --> 21:41.131
under a sheet and toe-up in my studio.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.750
Sorry.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.971
The good-looking one here
really cared about you.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.265
Doesn't help my dead ass now.

21:50.393 --> 21:54.308
- So what's next?
- You're off to your final destination.

21:54.439 --> 21:57.523
- Where's that?
- No idea.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.359
You have some idea.

22:00.487 --> 22:05.445
You know a lot of shit
and you play it close to the vest.

22:05.575 --> 22:08.327
I would hate to play poker with you.

22:08.453 --> 22:12.747
Don't nod, motherfucker, I'm dead.
Show me some cards.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.164
Let me ask you something.

22:17.295 --> 22:20.794
Yoga's supposed to be connected
with the divine, right?

22:20.924 --> 22:28.385
In yoga, the drama of the universe
gets acted out in our physical body.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.432
Pure energy marries pure consciousness.

22:31.559 --> 22:35.604
Trust me, only way to fly.

22:35.730 --> 22:39.680
- For the opportunity of spiritual growth .
- Yeah, that too.

22:39.818 --> 22:42.391
I led this serene, beautiful life

22:42.529 --> 22:47.072
and I am not embarrassed to tell you
the women are phenomenal.

22:49.202 --> 22:52.986
That one there,
she got a little crush on you.

22:53.123 --> 22:57.950
I try to live on the periphery.
I try not to get involved with the living.

23:01.256 --> 23:06.926
OK, man, you stay on the periphery.
Sounds like fun.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.099
He was so pure.

23:16.646 --> 23:20.430
- I wanted him inside of me.
- I can't take this. I gotta go.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.150
Oi, little boy.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.197
I was wondering
if you could tell your pretty...

23:29.117 --> 23:31.442
You motherf...

23:35.915 --> 23:39.201
- You dropped this.
- Yeah.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.791
What's ETD?

23:41.921 --> 23:44.709
Estimated time of death.

23:46.051 --> 23:49.633
What is this?
Whose estimated time of death?

23:54.642 --> 23:58.889
- Who are you?
- I'm Mason. Can I have this back, please?

24:02.734 --> 24:07.977
- What are you, some kind of grim reaper?
- Yes.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.820
- Say it.
- What?

24:11.951 --> 24:16.032
Tell me what you are.
Come on! Tell me what you are!

24:16.164 --> 24:18.572
I'm... I'm a... I'm a... I'm a...

24:18.708 --> 24:21.911
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a reaper?

24:22.045 --> 24:25.046
Say it again. Come on, say it again!

24:25.173 --> 24:26.916
I'm a... I'm a reaper.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.544
I'm a reaper!

24:29.678 --> 24:31.800
I'm a reaper!

24:47.904 --> 24:49.647
Yoga was very good for me,

24:50.615 --> 24:55.443
the way it made my body feel,
my mind was at peace.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.116
I loved some wonderful women.

24:58.248 --> 25:04.203
Housewives, shop girls, lawyers,
social workers. Black, white, Asian.

25:04.337 --> 25:08.465
- I was like a kid at a parade.
- Yeah, I've seen that parade.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.129
- You're not one of those monk-hats?
- No.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.385
You know, vow of celibacy,
silence, poverty.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.436
That's some wrong-headed shit,
don't you think?

25:21.563 --> 25:24.517
Yeah, I think it'd be wrong for you.

25:24.649 --> 25:29.644
Touching, stretching, laughing, talking.
That's all I did, my whole life.

25:29.779 --> 25:34.322
You should have talked to
that pretty woman in my class. She liked you.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.780
- You think too much.
- I don't think enough.

25:39.914 --> 25:43.663
You're a wise man.
And a wise man knows how to live.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.586
A wise man knows
how much he doesn't know.

25:53.595 --> 25:58.838
I'm just saying
I've seen a lifetime of love and affection.

25:59.809 --> 26:03.641
- Then you're a lucky man.
- Try this one.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.904
Very nice. Don't forget to breathe.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.332
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

26:36.096 --> 26:39.346
- I hope we meet again.
- I hope so, too.

27:28.273 --> 27:32.733
You know you take something for granted?
That's how I was with Murray.

27:32.861 --> 27:37.819
- He was just in the background.
- No, that's not true.

27:39.743 --> 27:42.862
It's like that Joni Mitchell song.

27:54.174 --> 27:56.878
I think you need to concentrate on...

27:57.010 --> 28:01.055
On what? What?
What could I possibly say?

28:01.181 --> 28:03.588
.. on the fact that...

28:03.725 --> 28:06.892
Could I tell Delores
I died earlier this year

28:07.020 --> 28:11.397
and I'm still waiting for
even the tiniest bit of perspective?

28:11.524 --> 28:16.352
.. that the universe...
will take care of things.

28:16.488 --> 28:18.279
Huh.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.779
You really believe that?

28:23.536 --> 28:26.371
- Yes, I do.
- I don't know.

28:30.669 --> 28:35.046
I think you need to trust
that everything is going to be OK.

28:36.132 --> 28:40.344
That the universe
is going to take care of you, of Murray.

28:43.223 --> 28:48.050
I realised by saying words
I wasn't even sure I believed,

28:48.186 --> 28:50.855
that comfort was enough.

28:50.980 --> 28:55.192
Maybe it was enough
to tell Delores things were going to be OK.

28:55.318 --> 28:59.398
Because even if they weren't,
they would be, someday.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.828
Mr Zetsman?

29:06.121 --> 29:10.581
The doctor said
he couldn't find anything wrong.

29:10.709 --> 29:14.706
Eddie's been acting so listless. Is he sure?

29:15.714 --> 29:19.332
- You gotta go?
- Yeah, my mom's picking me up.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.875
Yeah, my mom, too.

29:25.890 --> 29:29.758
- Your cat's gonna be OK.
- He is?

29:33.648 --> 29:37.231
- What's its name?
- Eddie. Eddie Rabbit.

29:39.279 --> 29:42.612
- Can I pet him?
- Sure.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.576
Eddie likes kids. He's a sweetheart.

29:47.662 --> 29:48.777
Cool.

29:53.668 --> 29:58.295
Ms Herbig?
Dr Levy says your cat's feeling much better.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.795
- Oh!
- You can see him if you want.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.463
Oh, God, what a day. Oh!

30:03.595 --> 30:05.884
My day.

30:08.683 --> 30:11.803
Do you want me to wait here? 'Cause I can.

30:11.936 --> 30:14.641
No. No, I'm fine.

30:14.773 --> 30:17.442
I mean, I can stay if you want.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.064
OK.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.313
Oh, Millie...

30:24.866 --> 30:27.986
I'll see you Monday morning
at Happy Time, OK?

30:36.711 --> 30:39.119
Hey.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.335
Hey!

30:40.465 --> 30:42.125
What?

30:42.717 --> 30:48.222
- So, uh, what's your name?
- Charlie. And your name's not Millie.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.424
No, it's not Millie.

30:50.558 --> 30:52.966
So how did you die, Not Millie?

30:53.812 --> 30:57.940
I got hit by a toilet seat
that fell from a space station.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.142
Toilet Seat Girl. Cool.

31:01.194 --> 31:06.864
- So what happened to you?
- Got hit by a car. Some drunk girl.

31:06.991 --> 31:10.158
- So where do you live?
- Here, there...

31:12.497 --> 31:14.620
I gotta go.

31:14.749 --> 31:16.576
Well, wait.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.960
What's that for?

31:21.089 --> 31:23.710
I don't know. Just having a day.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.918
Just take it.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.097
Awesome.

31:39.357 --> 31:42.358
- So what's your real name?
- George.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.609
See you around, George.

32:07.677 --> 32:10.382
Where are you today?

32:16.019 --> 32:18.889
No. No.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.560
# Do you know that behind of this bond...

32:21.691 --> 32:24.099
She seems OK.

32:24.235 --> 32:26.773
No, I don't... I don't know anything.

32:28.490 --> 32:31.111
Listen, I'll call you later.

32:34.454 --> 32:39.531
# A-boom ba
Can you hear my heart beat in this hurt?

32:40.210 --> 32:43.543
# Do you know that behind of this hurt

32:44.130 --> 32:48.210
# Lies the deep desire I'm in love, hey?

32:48.343 --> 32:52.091
# Make a wonderful love if I may #

32:52.222 --> 32:56.469
The day I dropped out of college
I remember lying on my bed.

32:56.601 --> 33:00.433
My mother came into my room
and she had been crying.

33:00.563 --> 33:04.810
She stared at me for a long time
and then she said,

33:04.943 --> 33:10.103
"You only have one shot at life, Georgia.
This is no dress rehearsal."

33:10.240 --> 33:15.400
And I said, "You know what, Mom?
Maybe I don't even wanna be in the play."

33:15.537 --> 33:18.158
A month later I was killed.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.959
I wonder sometimes
if someone was listening.

33:26.589 --> 33:29.674
And I commit her soul to Thee.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.877
Amen.

33:32.012 --> 33:33.719
Amen.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.640
Thank you very much.

33:40.770 --> 33:42.846
D'you wanna go first?

33:42.981 --> 33:45.519
Shouldn't we wait for Dad?

33:45.650 --> 33:49.351
- Do you want me to wait?
- Not really.

33:55.952 --> 33:59.701
Georgia, I'm sorry I wasn't sweeter.

34:02.334 --> 34:06.331
I'm sorry that
I ever criticised your appearance

34:06.463 --> 34:09.214
because you were a beautiful girl.

34:10.382 --> 34:15.010
- You forgot to meet her at the airport once.
- That was your father's fault.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.427
If you say so.

34:17.556 --> 34:21.389
Can I please just do this how I wanna do it?

34:25.065 --> 34:26.974
I... I'm sorry.

34:30.027 --> 34:34.737
I'm sorry that I didn't show you
as much affection as I felt for you.

34:36.284 --> 34:38.407
Because I did love you.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.452
And I miss you.

34:45.627 --> 34:48.496
- Nice, Mom.
- Thanks, honey.

34:49.964 --> 34:52.337
Do you wanna say something?

34:53.259 --> 34:56.379
Yeah, but... can you, like, go away?

34:57.764 --> 34:59.342
Seriously?

35:05.563 --> 35:07.639
Mom...

35:10.694 --> 35:12.982
Thank you.

35:15.865 --> 35:19.317
I miss you too.
Probably more than Mom does.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.663
This is us fishing at the lake last summer.

35:26.793 --> 35:29.913
And if somebody swipes it,
I have the negative.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.296
We could come back.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.884
OK.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.937
Maybe tomorrow.

35:56.031 --> 35:58.782
It's me with my little sister.

35:58.908 --> 36:01.281
Her handwriting's exactly like mine.

36:02.370 --> 36:05.870
- Can I swipe this?
- It's your grave.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.075
Thank you, Daisy.

36:08.209 --> 36:11.958
I keep forgetting
how young you were when you were killed.

36:12.964 --> 36:17.341
Is this a nice headstone?
I mean, is it pretty?

36:17.469 --> 36:20.138
It's a good one. Top drawer.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.890
Where's Mason?

36:26.936 --> 36:28.846
There he is.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.850
Hey, Mason.

36:33.985 --> 36:38.149
I took his soul last year.
Right cocksucker. Glad he's dead.

36:38.281 --> 36:42.943
- There you go.
- You can put them there.

36:44.162 --> 36:48.290
Rube, thank you! Everyone!

36:48.416 --> 36:51.370
- Champagne's cold. Can we drink it now?
- May I?

36:51.503 --> 36:55.203
Try not to snap the flutes.
They belong to my Aunt Lillian.

36:55.340 --> 36:58.507
It is a good day to be a reaper.

37:09.020 --> 37:12.721
OK, here's to George. Dead like us.

37:14.901 --> 37:17.107
- Cheers.
- To Georgia.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.110
- To me.
- To you.

37:22.575 --> 37:26.739
Hey, that is really good.
I have a confession to make.

37:26.871 --> 37:31.249
- Graveside, no less.
- I've never had champagne before.

37:31.376 --> 37:35.623
- Wow. I've had too much.
- What does it taste like to you?

37:37.716 --> 37:40.041
Like I wish I never died.

37:44.097 --> 37:49.304
- It's pretty where I am, isn't it?
- Very pretty.

37:49.436 --> 37:54.228
They usually put cemeteries
on the edge of town. Out of the way.

37:54.357 --> 37:56.729
Next to railroad tracks, highways.

37:56.860 --> 38:01.438
I like 'em in the middle of town.
Everybody can see us.

38:02.157 --> 38:04.648
I love cemeteries.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.869
The quiet, the stories, the headstones.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.620
- I hate 'em.
- Why?

38:09.748 --> 38:11.787
'Cause they live here.

38:11.916 --> 38:15.617
- They who?
- The gravelings, fool.

38:15.754 --> 38:18.042
Over there.

38:18.173 --> 38:21.090
Get outta there! Git!

38:24.888 --> 38:28.932
- A little more bubbly, everyone?
- Please.

38:29.059 --> 38:32.677
Georgia, I'm sorry for your loss...

38:33.897 --> 38:40.065
.. things in life you won't do, people
you won't know and who won't know you.

38:40.195 --> 38:42.686
But there's this, this life...

38:44.032 --> 38:46.155
.. where you are loved.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.530
- Drink up.
- Cheers.

38:55.001 --> 38:58.370
- "This is no dress rehearsal."
- What's that?

38:58.505 --> 39:03.250
Some drunken writer said
that there are no great second acts in life.

39:03.385 --> 39:06.504
I'm not sure he knew
what he was talking about.

39:06.638 --> 39:09.176
Or maybe he just never knew me.

39:09.307 --> 39:13.221
- Shall we let George kill the bottle?
- I think we should.

39:19.484 --> 39:23.268
So... any Post-its tonight?

39:25.240 --> 39:28.406
That night,
a man was killed by a speeding car

39:28.535 --> 39:30.990
and I was there to take his soul.

39:31.121 --> 39:34.786
The street where he died
turned into a flowing river of lights

39:34.916 --> 39:37.489
and he hesitated at its banks.

39:37.627 --> 39:42.455
I told him to take a deep breath,
"As if it's the last one you'll ever take."

39:42.590 --> 39:46.671
Because sometimes in life,
or in death, I guess,

39:46.803 --> 39:49.009
you just never know.

40:29.304 --> 40:31.629
