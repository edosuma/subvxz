30:20.967 --> 30:22.567
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

30:22.567 --> 30:24.667
THIS SHOULD MORE THAN COVER
THE BISQUICK, ASSHOLE.

30:24.667 --> 30:27.133

32:39.400 --> 32:41.200
WHILE YOU WERE UP
IN NORTH LAWNDALE

32:41.200 --> 32:42.900
STICKING A NEEDLE

33:26.233 --> 33:28.066

33:28.066 --> 33:30.667
ROGER RUNNING TREE AND I
BROKE UP.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.233
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

33:32.233 --> 33:34.633
HE'S GOT ANGER ISSUES.

33:34.633 --> 33:38.233
PLUS HE'S ON THE RUN
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

33:38.233 --> 33:43.200
SOMETHING LIKE COLLECTING
FALSE REPARATIONS.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.467

INDIAN BLOOD THAN I DO.

33:45.467 --> 33:48.500

33:48.500 --> 33:50.734
BUT THE CHILDREN, FRANK.

33:50.734 --> 33:54.000
OH, MY GOSH, FRANK,

THEY'RE SO ADORABLE.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.400

WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED

33:59.400 --> 34:02.133
AND ADOPT THEM BEFORE
HE SHOWED HIS TRUE COLORS,

34:02.133 --> 34:06.767
WHICH IS EVIDENTLY
BROWN AND NOT RED.

34:06.767 --> 34:09.934
FRANK, THEY'RE ALONE
IN THE WORLD.

34:09.934 --> 34:13.000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GETTING AT?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.867
ALL I NEED
IS A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.433
FRANK, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

34:30.033 --> 34:32.166
- HEY.

34:32.166 --> 34:34.200

MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOU,

34:46.333 --> 34:49.200
AND YOU BROKE IT DOWN

34:49.200 --> 34:51.667
I MEAN, WHO SCHEDULES
SOMETHING FOR 12:55?

34:51.667 --> 34:53.367

YOUR TIME.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.967
- RIGHT, BUT YOU EVEN PUT
IN PRESET BATHROOM BREAKS.

34:55.967 --> 34:59.066

35:20.266 --> 35:21.834
YOU KNOW, IT'S--I CAN'T--

35:21.834 --> 35:23.500
I CAN'T REGIMENT MY LIFE
LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT?

35:23.500 --> 35:25.467
