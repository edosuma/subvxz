00:28.416 --> 00:31.875
CERTAIN ASPECTS HAVE BEEN FICTIONALIZED
FOR STORYTELLING PURPOSES

00:31.958 --> 00:35.250
ANY SIMILARITY TO ACTUAL PERSONS
OR EVENTS IS NOT INTENDED

00:49.750 --> 00:50.875
Good morning.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.708
Good morning.

00:53.833 --> 00:57.666
Saudi Arabia wins Security Council
non-permanent membership,

00:57.750 --> 01:01.541
which will be a two-year membership
as of next year.

01:01.625 --> 01:04.125
Then Saudi Arabia has declared…

01:04.208 --> 01:07.791
Some scholars say that a woman
must fully cover up her arms,

01:07.875 --> 01:12.875
while some say only to the wrist,
and some say till half of the forearm.

01:12.958 --> 01:16.000
90% of our problems
are not simply preordained,

01:16.083 --> 01:18.000
but are due to our shortcomings.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.541
Good morning, beautiful.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.375
At least return the greeting.

01:53.041 --> 01:54.750
Don't be late like last time.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.833
-Good morning, Mr. Atiq.
-Good morning.

SECONDARY SCHOOL 2300 FOR GIRLS

FROM THE ASHES

02:24.916 --> 02:27.041
A DAY EARLIER

02:27.125 --> 02:29.791
SECONDARY SCHOOL 2300 FOR GIRLS

02:41.791 --> 02:43.958
Cover up. Cover up, girl.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.333
May God guide you all.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.916
Good.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.458
YOUR SCHOOL IS YOUR SECOND HOME
KEEP IT TIDY

03:05.166 --> 03:09.791
Class of the month
is senior class, science division C.

03:25.916 --> 03:26.916
Well done.

03:41.583 --> 03:46.083
An ideal student
of perfect manners and high grades.

03:46.666 --> 03:49.458
She stands out among her peers.

03:49.541 --> 03:52.458
And above all, she respects her teachers.

03:53.708 --> 03:57.541
Every mother would wish
for a daughter like this student.

03:57.625 --> 04:00.083
The student of the month

04:00.166 --> 04:01.375
is Amira Saeed.

04:18.875 --> 04:22.500
She gets that every month.
As if she's the only student.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.375
There goes the nerd.

04:31.958 --> 04:33.583
The morning inspection.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.125
Would you look at that!

04:37.208 --> 04:39.125
Do you think I can't see you?

04:39.208 --> 04:40.833
Spit out that gum.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.750
Yes, you, Mashael.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.250
Or do I have to call you out by name?

04:47.708 --> 04:49.125
-Quickly.
-Nails.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.166
Quickly.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.416
Nails.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.833
-Cigarettes, huh?
-Your hands.

04:55.916 --> 04:57.000
Stand there.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.416
Would you look at that!

04:59.500 --> 05:02.333
Step out of the line.
Stand with the violators.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.625
What's all this make up?

05:10.750 --> 05:13.291
Step out of the line.
Stand with the violators.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.583
Show your hands as soon as I reach you.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.625
Show me your nails.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.916
I said show me your nails!

05:32.458 --> 05:34.708
Well, well, well, when is the wedding?

05:35.625 --> 05:39.208
This is for my cousin's wedding, Ma'am.

05:39.291 --> 05:41.791
Is this a school or your cousin's wedding?

05:42.500 --> 05:45.625
Remove the nail polish.
Don't get up in my hair.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.083
Why? Is she shampoo?

05:50.208 --> 05:52.958
Girl! There isn't anything funny!

05:53.916 --> 05:55.750
To the vice principal's office.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.041
-It was funny.
-Yes.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.291
You won't rest
until you sign a pledge, huh?

06:00.375 --> 06:03.666
And you, don't laugh,
or you'll sign a pledge too.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.250
MY SCHOOL'S CLEANLINESS
IS A TESTAMENT TO MY CIVILITY

06:13.333 --> 06:15.041
Where did you hide the gum today?

06:16.708 --> 06:17.708
In my sock.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.458
To the vice principal's office.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.083
Quick.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.666
Listen to me, Heba.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.958
First, stand up straight.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.958
Second, this attitude of yours
won't benefit you,

06:58.041 --> 06:59.708
nor will it make you stand out.

06:59.791 --> 07:02.458
Focus on yourself
and your classes, or else.

07:02.541 --> 07:05.625
This is the last time
I pull you out of the line.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.416
Do you understand?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.458
Yes, Ma'am.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.541
And you, give me your gum. Now.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.250
Go to your classes.

07:36.541 --> 07:37.583
Hurry up!

07:41.333 --> 07:45.583
All right, girls, before I go,
I want to congratulate Amira once again.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.916
Speaking of, I've arranged
for another Student Speech contest.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.750
Hand me your written speeches
by first period tomorrow.

07:52.833 --> 07:56.458
The winner's name will be added
to the honors board, all right?

07:56.541 --> 07:58.041
Who wants to participate?

07:58.958 --> 08:03.000
Excellent. As I said,
hand me your speeches by tomorrow, okay?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.166
Bless you.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.958
Why bother if we know the outcome?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.625
What do you mean, Heba?

08:11.708 --> 08:14.833
We all know that you'll choose Amira.

08:14.916 --> 08:17.875
If I do, it's because
she's exceptional and hardworking.

08:17.958 --> 08:22.166
I have no issue with any of you, Heba.
You're all equal in my eyes.

08:22.250 --> 08:25.458
I promise, if you write a suitable speech,
I'll choose you.

08:25.541 --> 08:26.750
But apply yourself.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.166
Hopefully.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.750
Okay. Bless you.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.583
I'm too busy.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.125
What's that?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.916
I'll be the first to hand it in tomorrow.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I hope so.

08:41.708 --> 08:42.666
Goodbye.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.083
Afaf.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.250
Hey, Afaf.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.541
I swear I can hear you.

08:55.625 --> 08:58.500
Look what I got you. It's brand new.

08:59.916 --> 09:01.458
Would you look at that.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.541
Any herbs from Sudan or North Africa
you haven't shared yet?

09:04.625 --> 09:08.541
No. This isn't like the ones
I got you before.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.291
This is from Al Qadarif.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.500
I want you to have a baby
that makes you happy.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.583
Yes, a new thing from a new city.

09:15.666 --> 09:19.875
This time, it's from Al Qadarif,
and last time, where was it from? Atba.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.458
Atbara. It's called Atbara.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.000
May God spoil the heads of your haters.

09:26.083 --> 09:30.125
Look, Mahasin, all the girls
in this school are my children.

09:30.208 --> 09:34.291
As for pregnancy,
God has finally blessed me.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.208
Wonderful! You're pregnant?

09:37.291 --> 09:39.916
Since when? Why didn't you tell me?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.458
I only knew yesterday.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.041
Congratulations.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.875
May God fulfill your wishes
and bless you with happiness.

09:46.958 --> 09:51.250
Yay!

09:51.333 --> 09:52.500
Keep it down!

09:52.583 --> 09:53.541
I'm happy.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.291
Be happy elsewhere, not here.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.166
Why is it rejected?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.875
Afaf, I'm short on teachers.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.875
And there's no such thing
as "pregnancy leave."

10:12.958 --> 10:16.583
It's called "maternity leave."
You'll get it right before you give birth.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.708
Ms. Hayat, we were going
to our hometown tomorrow.

10:19.791 --> 10:23.291
I know how stressed you are.
It's your first pregnancy.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.416
But if you have a medical issue,

10:25.500 --> 10:28.083
get me a report,
and I'll approve your leave.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.000
-Ms. Mahasin.
-Yes?

10:37.083 --> 10:39.958
-How did Rana do in your exam?
-Let me check.

10:44.166 --> 10:48.166
RANA HAMAD - 13.5

10:48.250 --> 10:52.583
God bless Rana.
She's always one of the top students.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.541
SUBJECT: FIQH
DATE: 10/1/1434 HIJRI

11:00.625 --> 11:02.416
TOPIC: VIRTUE OF WASHING THE DEAD

11:09.833 --> 11:13.583
Next class, each of you
needs to bring her shroud.

11:15.125 --> 11:18.541
Because we'll learn
how to shroud the deceased.

11:18.625 --> 11:19.500
WASHING THE DEAD

11:19.583 --> 11:21.125
How depressing.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.541
For your information, Ms. Mashael,

11:24.625 --> 11:27.208
you were wrapped in cloth
when you were born,

11:27.291 --> 11:31.166
and when you die,
they'll wrap you in cloth too.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.333
The cloth that covers us up
and guards our modesty.

11:35.333 --> 11:39.458
That's why God ordered women
to be covered and wear the hijab.

11:42.750 --> 11:46.916
Really? Do men get covered in silk?
They're not like us, I suppose.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.791
There's no comparison.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.916
Women tempt men.

11:51.625 --> 11:54.041
Wasn't Potiphar's wife tempted by Joseph?

11:54.125 --> 11:57.208
Would you like to give the class
instead of me, Ms. Heba?

11:58.333 --> 12:02.750
You said it yourself.
Joseph, peace be upon him.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.625
A divine messenger
can't be compared to humans.

12:05.708 --> 12:08.250
Stop being uncouth
and respect the curriculum.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.333
And religion.

12:11.916 --> 12:13.083
Pass these around.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.375
Ms. Huda is absent today.

12:19.458 --> 12:22.166
The period after recess
will be for activities.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.166
Yes!

12:25.166 --> 12:29.416
Prepare yourselves
to tidy up the storeroom.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.583
Until you all learn not to argue with me.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.083
But we haven't done anything.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.250
One person's mischief affects all, Amira.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.416
"But we haven't done anything."

12:52.916 --> 12:53.958
What a pain!

12:55.000 --> 12:55.833
Quiet!

13:03.916 --> 13:05.500
Tell Ms. Hayat what happened.

13:05.583 --> 13:08.333
For no reason,
Mona pulled her eyes like this

13:08.416 --> 13:11.166
and said, "Do you see the world like us?"

13:11.250 --> 13:12.750
And the girls mocked me.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.333
Ms. Seham, take her to your office
to write a complaint.

13:16.416 --> 13:19.541
I complain about them every day
and nothing happens!

13:22.583 --> 13:23.833
What do you want me to do?

13:23.916 --> 13:27.250
It's normal for your classmates
to joke with you. Come up with a comeback.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.375
Okay, Jameela, wait for me in my office.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.916
They have gone too far.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.458
This may open the door
to things we'd rather avoid.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.500
It'll resolve by itself.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.666
It's dangerous
to allow this bullying to continue.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.041
-You see how the girls are.
-Seham.

13:47.208 --> 13:48.708
Life is full of problems.

13:49.291 --> 13:53.625
If a girl can't handle her classmates,
how will she handle life?

13:55.541 --> 13:57.625
Let her write a complaint and toughen up.

14:06.125 --> 14:10.375
Please, I'll get you the money
in the morning.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.583
Girl!

14:13.541 --> 14:15.708
Didn't we say that credit isn't allowed?

14:16.333 --> 14:19.125
If you have money, pay.
If you don't have any…

14:19.208 --> 14:20.083
CANTEEN

14:20.166 --> 14:22.416
…then don't hold up the line. Move along.

14:31.791 --> 14:32.791
Oops.

14:33.625 --> 14:34.625
I didn't see you.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.083
-Are you kidding?
-Amira!

14:36.666 --> 14:38.375
Listen, never mind her.

14:38.458 --> 14:42.583
-As for the sandwich, I'll give you one.
-It's not about the sandwich, Rana.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.875
-What did you accomplish?
-Girl!

14:44.958 --> 14:47.416
Get out of here
before I have you for breakfast.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.208
That's enough, Heba.
You too, come with me.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.416
Aren't you okay? Then it doesn't matter.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.958
If only she wasn't friends
with the principal's daughter.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Oh well.

15:01.416 --> 15:02.416
Eat up.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.666
Why did you report Mona?

15:22.916 --> 15:25.916
-No one reports my teddy bear.
-I'm not a bear.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.583
Only I can call you a bear.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.166
-Okay.
-You don't.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.166
Principal Hayat,
could you listen to this issue?

15:38.250 --> 15:40.875
I have an important appointment
at the court.

15:41.791 --> 15:44.916
Don't come running to me
with every problem. Fix it.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.166
Make them write pledges.

15:50.041 --> 15:55.500
VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

15:57.750 --> 16:00.375
Sweetheart, ask your father
to complain about them.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.125
Maybe they'll be expelled,
and we can get this over with.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.708
Even I am sick of them.

16:04.791 --> 16:08.291
No, I can't bother my father
with such problems.

16:08.375 --> 16:11.291
I don't want to harm them.
I just want them to leave me alone.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.416
Okay, I'll make them write pledges.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.708
You may go.

16:27.166 --> 16:31.250
Poor girl. I really feel for her.
All the girls are bullying her.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.333
The only poor girl here is me.

16:33.416 --> 16:36.958
She goes to handle her court issues
and leaves me in charge.

16:37.041 --> 16:40.166
To be honest,
the principal's role suits you.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.791
CHEMISTRY

17:09.666 --> 17:10.875
PHYSICS

17:10.958 --> 17:14.875
Finally, we'll get new books
to replace the filthy ones we have.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.750
As if that makes a difference to her.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.791
Hey, keep it to yourself,

17:22.583 --> 17:24.875
or I'll smack you in the face
with Arab History.

17:25.541 --> 17:26.500
What a pain.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.666
-Hey, where to?
-Listen.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.208
I'll call Saad from Mom's phone.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.791
I don't want anyone to notice.
Don't let me get caught.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.916
Look at you being all romantic.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.375

STOREROOM

18:03.166 --> 18:08.958
CLEANING STORAGE

18:27.750 --> 18:28.750
Hello, Saad.

18:29.583 --> 18:30.458
How are you?

18:32.750 --> 18:35.458
Would you look at that!

18:37.583 --> 18:40.583
I thought I wouldn't recognize
the storeroom after you'd tidied it.

18:40.666 --> 18:41.500
What's this?

18:41.583 --> 18:43.666
No, Miss. We really were tidying up.

18:43.750 --> 18:47.541
Yes, I can see how the storeroom
was tidier before you all came.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.500
Back to class.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.041
I can't rely on you.
Mona, leave the books.

18:55.916 --> 18:56.750
Come on.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.166
Back to class.

18:59.791 --> 19:02.541
I swear I'll make you both write pledges.
Move it!

19:03.375 --> 19:05.500
Okay, bye. I'll talk to you later.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.208
Bye.

19:13.708 --> 19:14.708
Where is…

19:22.458 --> 19:23.625
Come in, girl.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.375
The money.

19:41.708 --> 19:45.333
TAKEN

19:46.166 --> 19:47.250
He's taken.

19:49.708 --> 19:53.833
-Look at this one. He's very cute.
-Marzouka, I don't like any of them.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.041
Those are the only ones.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.791
Look, the rest are all taken.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.000
-I don't like any of them.
-Look at this one.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.583
-He's handsome.
-No.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.875
Look at this one!

20:07.375 --> 20:09.083
-Where?
-This one is handsome.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.208
Marzouka, he's not.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.250
I like none of them. I don't want this.

20:13.833 --> 20:14.833
My money.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.250
You think looking is free?

20:19.750 --> 20:22.458
-No, honey.
-I liked none of them. I want my money.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.375
Next week I'll have a fabulous batch.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.166
My money.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.708
Not going to happen. Back to your class.

20:40.666 --> 20:41.583
Amira.

20:42.125 --> 20:43.083
Hey, girl!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.250
Wait up. Why are you in a hurry?

20:46.333 --> 20:48.791
I forgot to tell you.
Dad's getting discharged today.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.166
Really? Praise God for his recovery.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.333
-Bless you.
-How's Uncle Saeed doing?

20:54.416 --> 20:58.250
He hasn't fully recovered yet,
but at least he'll be back home.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.291
Thank God. The main thing is
he's back and doing well.

21:01.375 --> 21:07.375
SECONDARY SCHOOL 2300 FOR GIRLS

21:08.291 --> 21:10.291
Did Fawzeiya's boy attend the hearing?

21:10.875 --> 21:12.375
He keeps postponing them, Mom.

21:13.916 --> 21:17.125
But the court got the receipts
proving I support my daughter.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.708
Let's see how he'll deny it.

21:18.791 --> 21:22.583
Fortunately, you're employed.
You'll win the case.

21:22.666 --> 21:24.166
He filed a new suit against me.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.958
For child custody.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.083
What? He can't take her.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.916
Ranno, my sweetheart.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.125
Ms. Mahasin showed me your grades today.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.333
You would've done better
if you'd studied harder.

21:40.416 --> 21:43.958
But Mom, I got 13.5 out of 15.

21:44.583 --> 21:45.916
That's very good.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.041
What do you mean "very good"?
That's in the past. We want excellence.

21:51.083 --> 21:54.083
You're the principal's daughter,
so you must be a top student,

21:54.166 --> 21:55.333
not just "very good."

21:55.416 --> 21:57.750
The girl has been studying all night.

21:57.833 --> 21:59.666
What more do you want from her?

22:00.291 --> 22:01.875
Please, Mom. Let me raise her.

22:03.541 --> 22:04.541
Sorry, Grandma.

22:07.375 --> 22:11.208
Anyway, the year is only beginning,
and we can improve.

22:11.291 --> 22:12.625
Make me proud.

22:15.208 --> 22:16.291
Hopefully.

22:28.625 --> 22:29.750
Chestnuts!

22:29.833 --> 22:31.000
Welcome.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.375
Wow!

22:33.875 --> 22:36.250
I knew you'd be here.

22:36.333 --> 22:39.250
You're all grown up
and making chestnuts now, huh?

22:39.333 --> 22:40.625
-Yes.
-God bless.

22:40.708 --> 22:44.916
I'll also make you Ma'dous, Saleeg,
and Molokheya.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.083
No, spare us the kitchen mess
and stick to painting with your father.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.125
I knew you'd say that.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.250
I'm supposed to be the best chef.

22:54.333 --> 22:57.041
May God grant you happiness
and success, my child.

22:57.125 --> 23:00.666
And good news, her grades are out.
Straight A's. God bless.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.750
God bless you. Congratulations. Well done.

23:05.125 --> 23:09.208
Come on, Saeed, you must rest.
You shouldn't be in the studio daily.

23:09.291 --> 23:10.708
Yes, Dad. You must rest.

23:10.791 --> 23:14.541
Not before I finish your friend's gift.
It's almost done.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.916
Her birthday is in two weeks.
We have time.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.833
Still, if I finish it early,
you'll have a chance to edit it.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.750
Since Rana gave her a gift,

23:22.833 --> 23:26.500
she's been counting the days
to give her this gift.

23:26.583 --> 23:29.708
-Aren't gifts a declaration of love?
-I'm with her on this one.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.916
I'm sure you're happy.
You just love misery.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.041
Yes, Dad. You must rest.
You just got out of the hospital.

23:36.708 --> 23:41.958
Yeah. Listen, dear. Passion never dies
even after one passes away.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.291
And those who live without passion

23:44.375 --> 23:46.958
live a soulless existence.

23:58.791 --> 24:00.750
Is this Ms. Wedad's class speech?

24:01.583 --> 24:04.166
-Yes.
-Why did you postpone it until now?

24:04.791 --> 24:08.708
No, Mom. I've been working on it all day,
not just now.

24:09.208 --> 24:13.083
I just wanted to write a final version,
you know, for--

24:14.291 --> 24:18.125
INCOMING CALL FROM DAD

24:20.625 --> 24:22.125
Has he called you before?

24:28.791 --> 24:30.291
Don't answer his calls.

24:31.916 --> 24:33.166
Until when, Mom?

24:33.958 --> 24:37.208
Until he realizes going to court
won't beat my resolve

24:37.291 --> 24:39.708
and he becomes a real father
to his daughter

24:39.791 --> 24:42.041
and doesn't call her
to turn her against her mother.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.375
Call him only when I tell you to.

24:52.916 --> 24:54.791
"Penitence," not "penance."

25:05.041 --> 25:06.041
Anyway,

25:06.708 --> 25:08.291
I have a hearing tomorrow.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.291
I won't be able to be at school.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.750
I hope Ms. Wedad selects your speech.

25:12.833 --> 25:15.250
Then your name will be added
to the honors board,

25:15.333 --> 25:16.625
like your friend, Amira.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.833
Make me proud.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.708
Yes, hopefully, Mom.

25:37.333 --> 25:38.958
Don't be late like last time.

25:44.875 --> 25:47.000
-Good morning, Mr. Atiq.
-Good morning.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.875
Bring breakfast right before recess.
It was cold last time.

25:50.958 --> 25:52.083
I will. I promise.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.291
God bless you.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.041
Who's there?

26:53.125 --> 26:55.333
Wait, I'm in here! Wait!

27:05.583 --> 27:10.375
SECONDARY SCHOOL 2300 FOR GIRLS

28:06.791 --> 28:08.041
Evacuate!

28:08.125 --> 28:10.166
There's a fire, girls! Evacuate!

28:10.250 --> 28:11.750
There's a fire! Evacuate!

28:22.166 --> 28:23.666
Quickly, girls!

28:26.041 --> 28:27.458
Hurry up, girls!

28:30.500 --> 28:31.750
Hello.

28:31.833 --> 28:34.791
I need formal permission
to evacuate the school immediately.

28:34.875 --> 28:38.000
There's a fire.
I won't be responsible for these girls.

28:38.708 --> 28:41.166
Vice Principal Seham
from Secondary School 2300.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.875
I need the permission right now.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.708
The defendant Hamad Saif
has postponed the case.

28:48.791 --> 28:50.000
Seriously? Again?

28:50.083 --> 28:52.666
I've been going back and forth
for months to no avail.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.041
Please keep it down.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.166
If you have a problem,
talk to your attorney.

29:02.625 --> 29:03.458
Hello.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.416
What did you say, Seham?

29:08.291 --> 29:09.583
What are you waiting for?

29:09.666 --> 29:12.041
Make the doorman open the gate
and get them out!

29:12.791 --> 29:14.625
But Rana! Where's Rana?

29:24.625 --> 29:27.375
Get out of the way, all of you!

29:27.916 --> 29:29.083
Atiq!

29:29.791 --> 29:32.166
Open the door, Atiq!

29:36.333 --> 29:38.916
-Get out, quickly!
-Hurry up!

29:39.000 --> 29:41.750
Quickly! There's a fire! Quickly!

29:43.666 --> 29:45.166
-Mashael!
-Hurry up!

29:45.750 --> 29:48.000
Go downstairs quickly!

29:49.666 --> 29:50.833
Hurry up!

29:50.916 --> 29:52.000
Get out, quickly!

29:52.083 --> 29:53.916
Quickly, girl! Where's Mashael?

30:06.666 --> 30:09.416
Heba, why are you standing here?
Get out, quickly!

30:14.500 --> 30:19.500
HONORS BOARD

30:25.250 --> 30:27.541
Why aren't you moving? Go downstairs!

30:32.583 --> 30:35.041
Marzouka, take them downstairs.
I'll follow you.

30:35.125 --> 30:35.958
All right.

30:36.041 --> 30:39.291
Come on, girls! Hurry up! Go downstairs!

30:39.375 --> 30:41.250
Come on, girl!

30:47.166 --> 30:49.375
SENIORS SCIENCE DIVISION D

30:50.916 --> 30:52.125
Open the door!

30:55.458 --> 30:57.916
Atiq, I spoke to the principal.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.208
Atiq, shame on you! Open the door!

31:01.291 --> 31:02.333
Quickly, girls!

31:09.291 --> 31:10.541
Ms. Afaf.

31:11.375 --> 31:13.666
Please, help me. I can't stand up.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.458
Ms. Afaf.

31:18.333 --> 31:22.416
Ms. Afaf.

31:23.458 --> 31:24.625
Ms. Afaf.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.083
Atiq!

32:21.416 --> 32:22.416
My leg!

32:23.125 --> 32:24.208
My leg!

32:42.708 --> 32:45.208
STUDENT OF THE MONTH
AMIRA SAEED

32:46.125 --> 32:46.958
Quickly!

32:47.750 --> 32:50.083
Rana! Come down here!

32:53.583 --> 32:54.583
Come down!

32:55.916 --> 32:57.166
Rana!

32:59.958 --> 33:02.250
Go upstairs!

33:20.541 --> 33:21.750
Open the door!

33:22.750 --> 33:23.916
Can anyone hear me?

33:24.458 --> 33:26.625
Open the door! Don't leave me here!

33:35.750 --> 33:36.750
Rana!

33:38.375 --> 33:40.750
Rana! Heba!

33:43.416 --> 33:44.500
Help me!

33:46.708 --> 33:47.833
I'm going to die.

33:50.916 --> 33:51.875
I'm…

34:06.125 --> 34:08.500
Rana, why aren't you downstairs
with the girls?

34:08.583 --> 34:09.875
-I--
-Rana!

34:16.583 --> 34:20.083
There is no power nor strength
except with Allah.

34:23.458 --> 34:24.750
Hurry up!

34:34.125 --> 34:35.416
-Where to?
-What do you want?

34:35.500 --> 34:37.666
-There are women in there.
-People are dying.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.375
-You have no right to open this door.
-Move away.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.708
-Women cannot go outside.
-Who do you think I am?

34:42.791 --> 34:44.750
Are you insane? People are dying in there.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.250
-God damn you!
-Girls, move away from the door.

34:48.333 --> 34:49.583
Move away from the door!

35:15.083 --> 35:17.125
The roof. Go upstairs to the roof.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.083
To the roof! Quickly!

35:20.583 --> 35:22.083
To the roof, all of you!

35:24.750 --> 35:26.208
How can I go with them?

35:27.166 --> 35:30.750
Zohour, don't worry.
We'll all go upstairs, okay?

35:30.833 --> 35:32.750
-Don't worry.
-I don't want to be a burden.

35:32.833 --> 35:35.458
-Leave me here.
-Don't say that.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.666
You're not a burden on anyone, okay?

35:37.750 --> 35:41.291
-You're not a burden--
-Ms. Afaf, the roof is locked.

35:44.458 --> 35:48.375
Okay. Go to the top floor, then.
I'll follow you there. Girls!

35:48.458 --> 35:52.458
Where are the rest of the girls? Girls!
Come help your classmates.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.041
Get to the roof,
and I'll follow you there.

35:55.125 --> 35:58.208
Even if the door is locked.
Don't come down.

35:59.541 --> 36:01.416
Don't you leave any girl behind!

36:07.833 --> 36:10.000
Have mercy, dear Lord!

36:10.083 --> 36:11.791
Mashael!

36:12.458 --> 36:15.000
Mashael, where's your mother?

36:15.083 --> 36:17.416
Is she inside the school
or is she outside?

36:18.958 --> 36:23.125
Take this. Cover up, my child.

36:26.375 --> 36:27.500
Oh God!

36:48.291 --> 36:49.291
Oh God!

36:51.458 --> 36:53.375
Heba! Where's Rana?

36:57.916 --> 37:00.875
Seham, where is Rana?

37:07.625 --> 37:09.333
Mona, where's Rana?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
I don't know.

37:22.833 --> 37:25.958
Marzouka, thank God you're safe.

37:26.041 --> 37:27.958
Marzouka, where's Rana?

37:36.916 --> 37:39.916
-Are there still girls inside?
-Calm down. We're doing what we can.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.916
Wait there, Ma'am. Please.

39:29.041 --> 39:32.250
The roof.

39:52.041 --> 39:52.916
Rana.

39:54.666 --> 39:55.541
Girls!

40:10.625 --> 40:13.916
Yes. Apart from the injured,
there's one confirmed death.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.250
They found her locked up in the storeroom.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.125
This may be arson.

41:23.375 --> 41:24.500
Ms. Afaf!

41:54.875 --> 41:57.791
THE CATASTROPHE
OF SECONDARY SCHOOL 2300 FOR GIRLS

41:59.041 --> 42:01.458
I informed the authorities
I was supposed to inform.

42:01.541 --> 42:06.541
I called the principal,
but the gate was locked by the doorman.

42:06.625 --> 42:10.250
When the vice principal informed you
of the fire, what measures did take?

42:12.500 --> 42:15.958
Ms. Seham called me
after she had already followed procedure.

42:16.041 --> 42:18.666
She called the education authority
and the fire brigade.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.625
Where was Amira at the time of the fire?

42:21.333 --> 42:23.708
I don't know. I didn't see her.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.500
I was in the toilet.

42:25.583 --> 42:27.541
So you didn't notice Amira's absence?

42:27.625 --> 42:29.875
Honestly, I wasn't paying attention
to anyone.

42:29.958 --> 42:32.583
All I can remember is that I was running.

42:32.666 --> 42:34.791
What do you remember the most
about the fire?

42:34.875 --> 42:36.750
I remember standing outside

42:36.833 --> 42:40.375
and seeing the girls pierced
by shards of glass.

42:40.458 --> 42:44.708
-Who keeps the key to the storeroom?
-It's kept in the teachers' room.

42:44.791 --> 42:46.583
Not with anyone in particular.

42:46.666 --> 42:49.833
-And any student could take it anytime?
-No.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.625
How come Amira had the key?

42:52.708 --> 42:53.750
I gave it to her.

42:54.333 --> 42:58.875
Because she had lost her mathematics book,
so I sent her to get another one.

42:58.958 --> 43:01.000
Who rescued you during the fire?

43:01.083 --> 43:04.125
Ms. Afaf, may she rest in peace,
came and kept saying,

43:04.750 --> 43:07.666
"Get out, girls. Move it."

43:08.208 --> 43:11.916
Until God gave us enough strength
and we managed to escape,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.375
but not all of us.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.291
So you heard the alarm from the classroom?

43:16.916 --> 43:20.125
She answered you already.
Why are you asking again?

43:20.208 --> 43:21.708
Please let me do my job.

43:24.625 --> 43:25.500
Tell me, kid.

43:26.916 --> 43:29.041
Were you in the classroom?

43:29.125 --> 43:30.625
Yes, we were.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.541
How did your hand get burned, Rana?

43:35.291 --> 43:37.583
I was trying to go down the stairs,

43:37.666 --> 43:40.708
then I saw Auntie Marzouka
holding one of the girls,

43:40.791 --> 43:43.625
trying to get through the hellish fire.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.208
I tried to go with her,

43:45.291 --> 43:49.000
but a banner fell between us
and burned my hand.

43:49.083 --> 43:51.708
About 40 people, students and teachers,

43:51.791 --> 43:54.625
testified that you weren't at the gate
at the time of the fire.

43:54.708 --> 43:57.250
The teachers sent me
to get them breakfast.

43:58.375 --> 44:03.291
Had I known this would happen,
I wouldn't have moved an inch.

44:06.791 --> 44:09.500
Why did you stop the NCO
from rescuing the girls?

44:09.583 --> 44:12.875
There were women inside.
Besides, he had no permission.

44:12.958 --> 44:15.500
The doorman left the women to the fire.

44:30.541 --> 44:32.458
Thank God for your recovery, Marzouka.

44:33.125 --> 44:35.083
Bless you, Ms. Hayat.

44:35.791 --> 44:39.208
They say you visited everyone.

44:39.291 --> 44:41.000
God bless you.

44:41.083 --> 44:44.083
You're my family,
and the girls are all my daughters.

44:44.583 --> 44:46.250
People don't realize that.

44:46.333 --> 44:50.166
You're the best principal we've ever had.
You do a good job.

44:52.083 --> 44:53.791
God bless you.

44:57.333 --> 45:00.375
You can't imagine my heartache
for Amira and Afaf.

45:00.458 --> 45:01.458
Rest their souls.

45:02.833 --> 45:06.666
You didn't see how Ms. Afaf
spared no effort

45:06.750 --> 45:08.291
to get the girls to safety.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.666
And Amira, my sweet Amira.

45:12.416 --> 45:13.791
My heart aches for her.

45:15.125 --> 45:19.833
But I am sure, Ms. Hayat,
that you'll find out who locked her in.

45:19.916 --> 45:23.583
-God will lead you.
-No one knows who did.

45:24.625 --> 45:25.791
Someone knows.

45:40.666 --> 45:42.083
God bless you.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.291
Hello.

45:54.375 --> 45:55.583
Hello.

46:03.833 --> 46:05.166
My condolences.

46:10.125 --> 46:10.958
Umm Amira.

46:12.833 --> 46:14.041
My condolences.

46:15.166 --> 46:18.875
You were responsible for my daughter.
How could you lose her?

46:22.333 --> 46:26.083
I understand what you're going through.
May God console you.

46:26.166 --> 46:29.291
My daughter was fine
when she left my house.

46:29.375 --> 46:32.250
She went to your school,
under your responsibility.

46:32.333 --> 46:36.208
They set her on fire
and buried her in the storeroom.

46:36.291 --> 46:38.708
Where were you?

46:39.375 --> 46:41.333
Answer me, who locked her in?

46:41.833 --> 46:45.333
Who burned her
and burned my heart with her?

46:46.250 --> 46:48.041
Who killed her?

46:48.125 --> 46:50.875
Your answer is my consolation.

46:51.625 --> 46:54.875
Answer! Say something!

46:54.958 --> 46:56.833
Why are you silent?

46:56.916 --> 46:58.875
Answer me!

47:00.291 --> 47:04.791
I'm putting you in God's hands!

47:10.708 --> 47:12.625
Oh, Amira, my girl.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.291
I can't believe that Amira's dead.

47:40.666 --> 47:43.166
It's a path we all end up taking, sweetie.

47:44.083 --> 47:45.333
Death is inevitable.

47:46.916 --> 47:50.625
Listen, stay here with me.
Don't go to school.

47:51.541 --> 47:53.041
We'll keep each other company.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.666
It is what it is, sweetheart.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.875
We can't change fate.

48:14.875 --> 48:18.416
It's been over two weeks since the fire.

48:20.750 --> 48:23.916
We have to come to school at night
to finish our curriculum

48:24.791 --> 48:26.916
while restorations continue by day.

48:28.083 --> 48:29.083
Unfortunately,

48:30.291 --> 48:32.333
the fire took from us a great educator

48:33.458 --> 48:34.916
and an ideal student.

48:35.875 --> 48:37.083
May they rest in peace.

48:38.208 --> 48:40.333
It also tarnished the school's reputation.

48:40.416 --> 48:45.000
That's why I've decided that no student
may leave class without her teacher.

48:45.625 --> 48:48.416
And no teacher may send a student
on any errand.

48:49.458 --> 48:50.708
From this day onward,

48:52.791 --> 48:55.500
there will be no leniency
for any violation.

48:56.083 --> 48:58.208
All the school doors are open.

48:59.166 --> 49:01.875
Whoever wants to learn is welcome.

49:01.958 --> 49:04.750
Anyone who doesn't like this can leave.

49:12.166 --> 49:16.250
Open your bags. I need to inspect them.

49:16.791 --> 49:19.375
Hand over any prohibited items you have.

49:23.666 --> 49:24.666
Principal Hayat.

49:28.583 --> 49:29.583
Listen, Seham.

49:30.541 --> 49:33.000
I've decided to conduct
an internal investigation

49:33.083 --> 49:35.041
to find out how this disaster happened.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.250
What could we do more than the police?

49:39.000 --> 49:41.250
Seham, the police don't know

49:41.333 --> 49:44.333
the nature of the relationships
among our girls like we do.

49:44.416 --> 49:46.041
We should complete their work

49:46.125 --> 49:48.791
and be a role model
to all departments and schools.

49:49.625 --> 49:51.708
Cigarettes? You're a smoker?

49:51.791 --> 49:52.791
Step aside.

49:55.333 --> 49:58.208
Get me the files
of all students with violations now.

49:59.375 --> 50:02.958
It's on a flash memory
because all the files were burned.

50:03.041 --> 50:04.875
Excellent. Bring it to me.

50:07.166 --> 50:08.375
God help me.

50:08.458 --> 50:10.750
-What do you have on you?
-My phone.

50:12.125 --> 50:14.333
We agreed only one of us
brings it each day.

50:14.416 --> 50:17.041
-It just happened.
-Hide it, quickly.

50:17.125 --> 50:19.958
-Stop. We'll get caught.
-Don't you want to quit?

50:20.708 --> 50:21.708
Step aside.

50:28.375 --> 50:32.125
PRINCIPAL HAYAT RADY

50:32.208 --> 50:35.666
This is Mona's phone. I searched it
and found disturbing messages.

50:38.500 --> 50:42.500
WE'LL BURN IT
THE PUNISHMENT WILL BE SEVERE

50:43.708 --> 50:46.083
I printed the texts.
These are the girls' files.

50:49.291 --> 50:52.750
YOU TOOK A PHOTO? DELETE IT
IT LOOKS STUPID, WE'LL BURN IT

50:52.833 --> 50:53.708
DON'T BE LATE

50:53.791 --> 50:57.125
IF THEY FIND OUT THIS TIME,
THE PUNISHMENT WILL BE SEVERE

51:00.125 --> 51:03.916
I'm sure our investigation
will uncover how Amira got locked in

51:04.000 --> 51:05.458
and who started the fire.

51:07.083 --> 51:08.208
Bring in the girls.

51:32.541 --> 51:34.625
Are these files for students or mobsters?

51:38.875 --> 51:42.500
In my opinion, you three are suspects.

51:45.708 --> 51:48.291
You lured Amira into the storeroom
and took a photo.

51:49.375 --> 51:51.625
Perhaps you locked her in
and started the fire.

51:52.791 --> 51:54.083
What are you saying, Ma'am?

51:54.166 --> 51:56.833
I can't stand you in particular.

51:56.916 --> 51:58.416
Stand there and let me finish.

52:01.458 --> 52:04.041
You had this conversation
on your phones, correct?

52:07.166 --> 52:09.583
It's clear that you planned your crime.

52:10.291 --> 52:11.833
No, you misjudged us.

52:13.125 --> 52:17.708
Ma'am, the girls wanted to celebrate
my birthday here at school.

52:17.791 --> 52:20.208
I had brought a candle for her birthday,

52:20.291 --> 52:22.375
and it was long and looked stupid.

52:22.458 --> 52:26.083
I sent them a picture of it.
They laughed at me, so I deleted it.

52:26.958 --> 52:29.708
Correct. We know we have many violations,

52:29.791 --> 52:34.791
so that's why I said to Mona
that the punishment would be severe.

52:34.875 --> 52:38.875
Would you look at that.
You're great at making up stories.

52:39.666 --> 52:40.708
Principal Hayat,

52:40.791 --> 52:43.416
the conversation with the picture
is on my phone.

52:43.500 --> 52:46.750
If you promise not to write me
another violation, I'll show it to you.

52:47.416 --> 52:48.250
Show me.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.708
Could you look the other way, please?

52:53.208 --> 52:54.750
So I can take the phone out.

53:05.750 --> 53:06.750
Here.

53:15.666 --> 53:17.375
Can I have my phone back?

53:18.708 --> 53:19.708
Leave it with me.

53:22.750 --> 53:23.666
Mona, you stay.

53:24.875 --> 53:27.750
Ms. Seham, take the rest and wait outside.

53:37.500 --> 53:40.333
-Clean that filth off of your brows.
-Ma'am, please, no.

53:40.416 --> 53:44.083
I swear I'll look like a fool,
and they'll laugh at me.

53:45.333 --> 53:47.250
Would you rather I call your parents?

53:53.250 --> 53:55.416
How was your relationship with Amira?

53:56.250 --> 53:58.375
Ma'am, don't remind me of her

53:58.458 --> 54:00.250
because I'm very sensitive.

54:00.333 --> 54:03.875
Whenever Amira is mentioned,
I get emotional.

54:03.958 --> 54:05.583
Because you feel guilty?

54:07.458 --> 54:10.250
There's a documented incident
of you locking her up in the computer lab.

54:10.916 --> 54:12.750
I was joking with her that day.

54:13.291 --> 54:19.458
COMPUTER LAB

54:28.625 --> 54:30.958
Heba, I forgot to do the math homework.

54:31.041 --> 54:33.000
-You're joking, right?
-No.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.750
Oh God, Mona.
I was going to copy it from you.

54:37.833 --> 54:40.208
-Now what do we do?
-What will we do?

54:42.166 --> 54:44.833
-What will we do?
-I'm thinking. Let me think.

54:47.166 --> 54:49.291
Listen, there's only one solution.

54:50.083 --> 54:52.750
Copy it from the nerd,
then I'll copy it from you.

54:52.833 --> 54:53.750
That's right.

54:54.875 --> 54:57.625
Amira, give me your math homework
before the teacher arrives.

54:57.708 --> 54:58.958
-Really?
-Yeah.

54:59.541 --> 55:01.291
Sorry, I won't give you my work.

55:03.000 --> 55:03.833
Why not?

55:04.916 --> 55:06.125
I worked hard on it.

55:06.833 --> 55:07.916
Why didn't you do it?

55:12.458 --> 55:13.625
Follow me.

55:15.250 --> 55:16.250
Hey!

55:19.500 --> 55:23.291
If I had the key, I would've locked her in
so she would miss Ms. Wedad's class.

55:23.375 --> 55:25.583
-Open the door!
-That'll teach you to listen.

55:25.666 --> 55:26.791
Girl!

55:26.875 --> 55:27.875
What's going on?

55:33.291 --> 55:35.791
Why do you keep doing that
to your classmate?

55:38.125 --> 55:38.958
Huh?

55:42.750 --> 55:44.041
You won't answer?

55:44.791 --> 55:47.541
Wait for me at Ms. Seham's office.
Now, go.

55:47.625 --> 55:49.583
Go. I have my eyes on you.

55:50.791 --> 55:52.208
Suppose I believe you.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.375
Who would want to do that to Amira?

55:55.458 --> 55:57.416
Honestly, I can't accuse anyone.

55:57.500 --> 55:59.000
No, I don't know.

55:59.083 --> 56:00.458
Get out and get Heba.

56:11.166 --> 56:12.375
What did she want?

56:12.458 --> 56:15.375
Not sure,
but she brought up our past violations.

56:15.458 --> 56:17.833
Didn't she know about them?

56:17.916 --> 56:20.750
I don't think so,
but this time she's targeting us.

56:20.833 --> 56:22.708
She wants to blame it on us.

56:25.125 --> 56:26.208
She wants you now.

56:26.291 --> 56:28.125
-What does she want?
-No clue, Heba.

56:30.583 --> 56:31.583
Move.

56:39.250 --> 56:41.333
You're the one
I've been the most lenient with.

56:41.416 --> 56:43.416
Don't worry,
I'm graduating in a few months.

56:48.208 --> 56:51.750
Funny to think
you'll graduate with all those violations.

56:56.291 --> 56:57.625
An immoral act.

56:58.375 --> 57:00.625
Why were you
in the bathroom stall with Mashael?

57:00.708 --> 57:03.000
I swear we were just using the phone.

57:03.083 --> 57:05.041
May God forgive whoever reported us.

57:05.708 --> 57:07.416
Who do you think reported you?

57:08.208 --> 57:09.708
May she rest in peace.

57:09.791 --> 57:13.333
And that's a strong motive
for you to hurt her and hate her.

57:13.416 --> 57:16.125
No, Ma'am.
It's true that I didn't like her.

57:16.208 --> 57:18.333
Not everyone has to like each other.

57:18.416 --> 57:20.875
But I would never lock her in
and cause her death.

57:21.458 --> 57:22.375
Really?

57:23.666 --> 57:25.916
For me, you are the prime suspect.

57:27.708 --> 57:29.666
Not because of the bathroom incident.

57:29.750 --> 57:31.125
Something's more important.

57:32.083 --> 57:33.583
Proof in your own handwriting.

57:34.250 --> 57:35.666
Isn't this your handwriting?

57:39.625 --> 57:41.500
Shall I remind you of what you wrote?

57:41.583 --> 57:45.416
"I wish I could erase Amira
from the school and from existence."

57:49.083 --> 57:50.083
Go, Heba.

57:50.750 --> 57:53.250
And tell your friends to go.
We'll resume tomorrow.

58:07.416 --> 58:11.750
Peace and Allah's blessings upon you.

58:25.916 --> 58:27.416
Thank God for your safety.

58:29.375 --> 58:31.208
Mom, I can't sleep.

58:31.875 --> 58:34.458
Even when I do, nightmares wake me up.

58:39.166 --> 58:41.833
Sweetheart, you'll get over the shock.

58:41.916 --> 58:44.750
Who lives forever anyway?
Everyone dies eventually.

58:50.166 --> 58:51.416
Take this pill.

58:52.791 --> 58:54.125
It'll help you sleep.

59:02.208 --> 59:03.875
You don't need to go to school.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.125
Stay home for a few days.

59:27.041 --> 59:28.333
Good evening.

59:29.833 --> 59:30.708
Honey,

59:31.291 --> 59:34.416
for the love of God,
your daughter is still young.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.708
Don't give her sleeping pills.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.166
Rana is under a lot of stress
and needs to rest.

59:39.875 --> 59:41.708
Sleep is the solution.

59:42.291 --> 59:44.416
Fine. You're always right.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.291
-Hello.
-Yes?

59:54.375 --> 59:58.208
I think we should communicate directly
instead of through attorneys.

59:58.291 --> 01:00:00.500
We have nothing to discuss. It's over.

01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:01.791
Seriously, Hayat?

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:04.750
Lawsuits and complaints are unlike you.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:07.333
They don't suit your name and reputation.

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:11.791
I willingly gave you 1,000 riyals monthly,

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:13.041
and I trusted you.

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:16.500
Suddenly, you deny that
and demand six years of child support?

01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:18.833
And you think 1,000 riyals is enough?

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.916
Don't you know your daughter's expenses?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.083
Are you really that out of touch?

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:26.291
Where has "you being so in touch"
gotten you with our daughter?

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:29.041
You left her and your school in chaos.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:32.708
And for what?
To sue me over a bit of money?

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:35.125
You denied me meeting my daughter
in normal places,

01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.291
and when you allowed me to see her,

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:39.458
she was in a hospital
being treated for burns.

01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:41.500
And then at the police station,

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:44.083
where she testified
on the death of her friend.

01:00:44.166 --> 01:00:46.416
Are these your motherly achievements?

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.375
How are you blaming me?

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:50.666
You'll never understand
those responsibilities,

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:54.375
nor what I do daily to ensure
that she's in the best and safest place.

01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:57.791
Please, we have nothing more
to discuss. It's over.

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.416
We'll talk in court only.

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.166
Are you done ranting?

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.833
Every day the same story?

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.291
God's given you plenty.
You don't need anything from him.

01:01:13.375 --> 01:01:16.875
I don't care about his money.
I'm bothered by his disregard.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:18.833
He neglected his daughter for six years.

01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:21.666
Now that he's married to another woman
who bore him a boy,

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.458
he wants to build family ties
at my expense.

01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:26.250
I swear he'll never see her!

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:29.000
It'll never be over like this.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:37.250
SECONDARY SCHOOL 2300 FOR GIRLS

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:46.875
Wow, your file is full of achievements.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.875
You sell cigarettes to students.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.625
It seems you're an expert smuggler.

01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.791
Ma'am, please. It was just one time.

01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:00.958
How am I an expert? I am so sorry.

01:02:01.875 --> 01:02:03.166
Forget about that.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:07.333
Tell me, there's something more important.
Who drew Amira on the board?

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:09.750
Wasn't it you?

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.375
When Ms. Afaf kicked us
out of the storeroom

01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:16.083
and we went back to class,
Heba drew Amira on the board.

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:17.500
I swear it wasn't me.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:20.416
Who's the one on my mind?

01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:24.125
Who's the one who broke my heart?

01:02:25.416 --> 01:02:27.916
-Who's the one on my mind?
-Clap your hands!

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.041
Hey!

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:32.041
-Who's the one who broke my heart?
-Clap your hands for Mona!

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:37.500
Line up, girls

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:41.166
Let me see the one on my mind
The one who broke my heart

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:45.000
My heart was taken from me
I used to be happy

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.583
If you know who she is, tell me…

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:49.875
What's this nonsense and vulgarity?

01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:54.333
Is this a school or a wedding hall?

01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:05.416
Which lowlife drew this on the board?

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:12.583
Amira, come with me.

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:28.666
Be quiet!

01:03:34.916 --> 01:03:36.666
I'll go eavesdrop on them.

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:02.291
I never told anyone except Heba, I swear.

01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:05.291
It wasn't what you think.

01:04:06.291 --> 01:04:09.375
Ms. Wedad was consoling Amira
after you all had bullied her.

01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:11.083
TEACHERS' ROOM

01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:13.958
Ms. Seham was at the door.

01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:15.833
She saw them, and she told me.

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:21.250
You have a fertile imagination
and a rotten conscience.

01:04:21.333 --> 01:04:22.375
Why do you hate Amira?

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:25.583
I don't. Why would I?
There was nothing between us.

01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:27.666
What about cheating on the biology exam?

01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:30.333
Wasn't Amira the one who reported you?

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:48.875
It's easier to study for the exam.
This subject is so easy.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.208
Will you shut up,
or should I glue your mouth shut?

01:04:57.041 --> 01:05:00.333
Do you think we have free time like you?
You're such a pain.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:05.125
Girls, put your desks back.

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:18.500
Oh, really?

01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:24.833
Stand up.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:27.875
Go stand by the board.

01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:30.458
When did you write this?

01:05:31.458 --> 01:05:33.166
How can you even read this?

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.166
You need a telescope to read these!

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:38.833
You guys are too much.
You could outwit the devil himself.

01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:40.333
Amira.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.541
Was Mashael with them?

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:45.458
Stand up.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:50.625
Go over there.

01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:53.666
Ma'am, I was only upset that day,

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.750
but I'm kind, and I don't hold grudges.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:59.458
Besides, Amira tattled on all of us,
not just me.

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:03.750
I don't know why you hated Amira,
envied her and tried to defame her,

01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:05.875
just because she's outstanding and honest.

01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:08.416
I swear there's nothing
between me and Amira.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.833
I didn't do anything to her.
I'd never hurt Amira--

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:12.791
Enough. Hush! Go away!

01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:10.000
Rana, what's wrong?
Don't you want to play?

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:19.000
In Allah we seek refuge
from the accursed Satan.

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:22.083
In the name of Allah,
Who with His name nothing can cause harm,

01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:23.791
He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:26.166
What's wrong with you, my child?

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:27.750
How long have I been asleep?

01:07:28.416 --> 01:07:30.583
You took the pill and slept right away.

01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:33.625
Try to go back to sleep.

01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.791
In the name of Allah.

01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:38.125
I'm right here. Don't be afraid.

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:47.083
Come on. I want you
to tell Principal Hayat what you told me.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:49.250
Next time
don't raise your voice at me, okay?

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:52.500
No, I want the whole school to hear
that you tarnished my reputation!

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:54.750
Why would you tell Hayat
about the message?

01:07:54.833 --> 01:07:57.583
You clearly want to tarnish my reputation
and ruin my future!

01:07:57.666 --> 01:08:00.833
First, lower your voice.
Second, her name is Principal Hayat.

01:08:00.916 --> 01:08:03.125
You really are rude and ill-mannered!

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:04.458
At least I'm not like you,

01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:06.791
pretending to be pious
while you're full of sin.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.333
-Calm down!
-Get off me!

01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:11.041
Stop! That's enough!

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:15.458
Not one word,
especially from you. Shut up.

01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:18.875
Ms. Seham, write a report
with all the details.

01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:01.125
Grandma.

01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:03.583
Where were you?

01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:05.625
-Where are you, Grandma?
-Here, Rana.

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:08.041
Another nightmare?

01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:10.541
Was Uncle Saeed here?

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:13.166
Was Amira's father here?

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.250
Yes, he was. Why are you so scared?

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.083
I'm not. Why was he here?
Did something happen?

01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:19.583
He brought you a gift.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.416
A gift for me?

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.541
Yes.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:25.041
I don't understand. Why?

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:28.708
Rana, it's just a gift.

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:32.458
He says his daughter,
may she rest in peace,

01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:36.250
asked him to paint a painting
just for you, for your birthday.

01:09:37.333 --> 01:09:39.000
God bless!

01:09:39.083 --> 01:09:40.833
Amira's dad is a real artist.

01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:44.666
May his daughter rest in peace,
and may God console him.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.666
Come, take a look. God bless.

01:09:48.583 --> 01:09:49.625
What's wrong?

01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:54.083
Grandma, I'm…

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:58.166
I know you miss her, dear.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.666
Parting is so difficult.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:02.166
There's no power nor strength,
except with Allah.

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:07.625
What's wrong?
Talk to me, my dear. Let it all out.

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:08.875
It's my fault.

01:10:09.958 --> 01:10:11.208
I killed Amira.

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:13.041
What are you talking about?

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.291
On the day of the fire…

01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:21.416
I feared that Ms. Wedad
would choose Amira for the honors board.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.250
I heard her ask Amira
to get a math book from the storeroom.

01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:30.250
Once she left the classroom,
I followed her.

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:35.791
She entered and left the key in the door.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:38.833
I locked her in.

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:41.833
Who's there?

01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:45.583
Wait, I'm in here! Wait!

01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:49.208
All I was thinking about
was my name on the honors board.

01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:51.458
-Just so that I wouldn't upset Mom.
-Rana!

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:53.166
You're just tired.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:56.541
It must be the medication
your mother is giving you.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:59.333
No, Grandma. I'm not hallucinating.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:03.375
During the investigation,
I was afraid, so I lied.

01:11:04.583 --> 01:11:06.625
But this is the truth. I locked her in.

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:09.958
I wish my hand would've been paralyzed
before I ever locked that door.

01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:14.250
Sweetheart, for the love of God,
for my sake,

01:11:14.333 --> 01:11:16.416
no one must ever hear this.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.625
And forget that you ever told me, okay?

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:22.500
You'd better get some sleep.
Come have a bite to eat first.

01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:25.000
-I swear, Grandma!
-Come on.

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:39.500
Your friends testified
that you hated Amira

01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:41.500
and that you bullied her the most.

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:43.250
And what's new?

01:11:43.875 --> 01:11:46.250
The whole school knows
that I didn't like Amira.

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:48.291
My friends know me very well.

01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.833
Do you know them well?

01:11:50.833 --> 01:11:51.791
What do you mean?

01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:55.791
Did you think Amira is the one
who reported you and Mashael?

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:57.875
Yes. Who else would?

01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:08.291
Promise me that you won't hurt her
or lay a hand on her.

01:12:08.375 --> 01:12:10.541
Otherwise I'll expel you immediately.

01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:13.583
I won't tell anyone or do anything.
I just want to know who.

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:15.208
Mona?

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:24.833
Life keeps throwing punches,
and each one feels worse than the last.

01:12:24.916 --> 01:12:27.541
It's a shame
your close friend reported you

01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:29.666
and added an ethical violation
to your file.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.250
-I think that she liked Amira.
-Who liked Amira?

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.791
Mona?

01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:39.166
Mona is the biggest hypocrite.
Look what she's done to me and Mashael.

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.166
Besides, Mona hates Amira the most.

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:45.333
Especially after she tattled
on Mashael and Saad's thing.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.125
I'm listening.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.875
Mashael has a boyfriend called Saad.

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:01.791
At the end of last year,
she introduced Mona to a friend of Saad's.

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:05.791
And the two of them skipped school
to meet the boys.

01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:07.416
Amira knew that.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.458
When they were late,

01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:11.791
Amira feared for them and told Ms. Seham.

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:14.958
Ms. Seham made a big deal out of it then.

01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:18.333
And because of that,
Mona's father forced her to get married.

01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:20.458
You can go.

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:28.333
Mona. Mashael.

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:38.750
Honestly, you have every right
to hate Amira

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:42.083
and want to get even with her.

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:45.250
-Not to the extent of killing her.
-No! What are you saying?

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:47.083
Relax. I'm not accusing you.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.041
Frankly, if I were you,
I would feel the same way.

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:56.583
Especially when she tattled
about you two going out with Saad.

01:13:58.833 --> 01:13:59.916
Isn't he called Saad?

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:03.500
Poor Auntie Marzouka was traumatized

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:05.416
and was mad at you for three months.

01:14:07.958 --> 01:14:10.708
You must think that was nothing
compared to your punishment.

01:14:11.833 --> 01:14:15.000
Your father forced you
to get married after that.

01:14:16.291 --> 01:14:17.875
Your father is really harsh.

01:14:19.541 --> 01:14:23.333
How could he marry you off like that?
You got divorced after two months.

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:24.541
What's the point?

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:30.625
As per your files,
you skipped school that day.

01:14:31.583 --> 01:14:34.708
And all the trouble you got into
because of your date with Saad,

01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:36.583
I wouldn't have known
if Heba hadn't told me.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:40.333
That means both of you are still suspects.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.041
Why do you think Heba told me?

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:46.958
To throw suspicion off her, obviously.

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:49.000
Heba isn't actually accused of anything.

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:51.333
She has a motive. Hate, just like you.

01:14:51.416 --> 01:14:54.500
-Nothing puts her in the storeroom.
-No, there is.

01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:57.083
The day of the fire,

01:14:57.166 --> 01:15:01.250
Amira went to the storeroom
to replace her math book.

01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:03.750
But no one knew how or when she lost it.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.500
But I know.

01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:08.833
The day before,
I saw Heba take Amira's book.

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.416
The next day,
she told me that she ripped it up.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.666
But Heba could deny that.

01:15:16.166 --> 01:15:17.458
And even if she doesn't,

01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:19.916
there's testimony
that puts her in the bathroom.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.791
Heba said she got her period
after Ms. Wedad's class

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.125
and went to the bathroom.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
That proves she wasn't in the storeroom.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.083
Come in, Heba.

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:37.750
Heba.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.666
Come in.

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:47.625
Anyway, I'm required
to present this information to the police.

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:52.291
I hope they don't focus on motives,
or you'll be in a vulnerable position.

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:53.458
Principal Hayat,

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:58.875
Heba did leave the classroom after class
and went to the bathroom.

01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:01.083
But she didn't go straight away.

01:16:01.583 --> 01:16:04.916
She left the classroom before me
and entered the bathroom after me.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.916
Enough time for her
to reach the storeroom and lock her in?

01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:09.916
Yes, absolutely.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.583
What? Are you insane?

01:16:11.666 --> 01:16:13.958
You ratted me out
while I was defending you.

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:17.083
No one knew about Saad
but us three and Ms. Seham.

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:19.833
She ended it that day,
but now you brought it up again.

01:16:19.916 --> 01:16:24.541
What do you mean no one knew?
Isn't that why Mona had to get married?

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:26.000
She never mentioned it again.

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:28.375
Be grateful that I supported you
and stood by you

01:16:28.458 --> 01:16:31.000
and was a friend
to a cleaning lady's daughter.

01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:35.166
Good news.

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:37.666
You're expelled from school.

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:40.166
We haven't done anything.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:53.625
Would you accept my apology, Seham?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.166
You're apologizing to me?

01:16:57.333 --> 01:17:00.083
Remember when you warned me
about the girls' bullying?

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:06.291
I wish I'd listened to you, Seham,

01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:09.500
and put a stop to all of it.

01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:14.250
Sadly, I thought the bullying
would help them toughen up

01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:16.083
and help them deal with life.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:20.500
I didn't expect that leniency
would lead us to this tragedy.

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:29.125
Had I dealt decisively with the bullies
as you advised me,

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:32.833
it wouldn't have come to this.

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:35.166
Not only would I have prevented
Amira's death,

01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:39.708
but I would've saved
her bullies' future too.

01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:46.500
In other news, the circumstances
of the student Amira Saeed's death,

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.541
the victim
of Secondary School 2300's fire,

01:17:49.625 --> 01:17:52.833
are not related to what caused the fire,

01:17:52.916 --> 01:17:55.375
adding that it is considered a coincidence

01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:57.791
with tragic consequences.

01:17:58.458 --> 01:18:02.500
Regarding punishment
for the student, Heba Anwar,

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:04.500
the source stated that she will face…

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:05.625
What's he saying?

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:07.125
…intimidation and manslaughter.

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:10.416
Sentencing will be left to the judiciary.

01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:13.541
What happened to Heba?

01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:15.958
Honey, have you had breakfast?

01:18:17.875 --> 01:18:19.250
You haven't, have you?

01:18:19.833 --> 01:18:21.541
Let's have breakfast together.

01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:24.666
Grandma, what happened to Heba?
Why is she being charged?

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.916
Nothing happened to Heba, my dear.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.166
Hey, have you taken your medicine?

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.916
Neither breakfast nor medicine, then.
Let's have breakfast.

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:36.541
Mom. Heba isn't the one
who locked Amira in.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:38.125
Rana…

01:18:38.958 --> 01:18:42.291
Calm down, okay?
For God's sake, my child, calm down.

01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:44.666
-Mom--
-You have been sick for two days.

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:47.041
Please, you're hallucinating.

01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:49.791
Never mind her. Don't respond to her.

01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:51.875
She's been sick and hallucinating.

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:54.458
It's all because of the pill you gave her.

01:18:54.541 --> 01:18:56.041
I'm not hallucinating!

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:57.583
-Calm down.
-I'm not mad.

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.208
For the love of God, dear.

01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:01.375
I locked Amira in, Mom.

01:19:03.375 --> 01:19:04.208
Me.

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:08.041
I locked her in, not Heba.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.125
I know.

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:17.625
But I am sure, Ms. Hayat,

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:20.791
that you'll find out who locked her in.

01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:22.625
God will guide you.

01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:24.541
No one knows who did.

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:26.666
Someone knows.

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:29.500
Who?

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:32.375
Your daughter knows.

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:35.541
Rana knows.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:39.166
The day of the fire…

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:41.625
Rana! Come down here!

01:19:45.166 --> 01:19:46.166
Come down!

01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:48.458
Rana!

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.791
Go upstairs!

01:19:54.416 --> 01:19:55.958
Amira's in the storeroom.

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:56.958
Go upstairs!

01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:59.500
-Amira!
-Go to the roof! Go!

01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:00.458
The storeroom.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:02.250
I'm sure…

01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:06.958
that Rana knows who locked Amira in.

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:19.541
Rana said that she was with you,

01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:22.458
helping you carry a girl
who had passed out.

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:23.958
That's when she was injured.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:26.583
That's what happened,

01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:30.041
and that's what you'll say
when you hopefully recover

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.208
and give a statement.

01:20:32.166 --> 01:20:35.208
-I can't say that--
-Marzouka, listen carefully.

01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:39.000
Your daughter's file
is filled to the brim with violations.

01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:42.250
Plus, she's friends with troublemakers.

01:20:42.333 --> 01:20:46.750
I remember Amira told me
that your daughter skipped school.

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:50.791
This could be considered a motive
for revenge on Amira.

01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:53.708
You wouldn't want that to be mentioned.

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.916
It's in neither of your interests.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.416
Not to mention all the contraband
and the phones in your room

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.041
and the catalog of boys.

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:06.666
I don't think you and your husband
want to be fired and sleep in the streets.

01:21:07.916 --> 01:21:12.916
No need to mention that Rana knows
Amira was locked in the storeroom.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.666
Understood, Marzouka?

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.416
What do you mean?

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.916
You handed her over to the police
and framed her?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.166
-She deserves punishment.
-And you know that she's innocent?

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.750
Who are you calling innocent?

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:31.500
She's a vile and vicious girl.

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:35.541
But she didn't lock Amira in
and cause her death!

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.291
No one caused Amira's death.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.625
Amira's time had come.

01:21:40.125 --> 01:21:42.500
Her death was inevitable.

01:21:44.625 --> 01:21:46.583
Are you listening to yourself?

01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:50.000
Do you even understand what you're saying?

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:52.458
What do you want me to say?

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:56.083
That I didn't raise you right?
To hand you over to prison?

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:58.875
Aren't you happy that I covered
your stupidity and failure?

01:22:02.541 --> 01:22:04.208
But I was never a failure.

01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:07.958
You made me a failure.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.916
I was a failure only in your eyes.

01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:14.500
I was never enough.

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:17.875
My success made no difference to you.
I have to be the best or nothing.

01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:20.750
Otherwise, I'm not fit to be
the daughter of Principal Hayat.

01:22:22.708 --> 01:22:24.625
So to be the best and to satisfy you,

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:28.416
I had to make
the worst mistake of my life.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.583
I locked her in to be the best for once
and satisfy you!

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:38.708
It's your fault.
You're the reason I did it.

01:23:52.458 --> 01:23:53.625
Dad.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.000
Why did you turn yourself in?

01:24:14.625 --> 01:24:16.208
Perhaps I just wanted to sleep.

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:21.541
And maybe because at least one of us
needs to say, "Enough,"

01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:24.166
and put an end to the hurt.

01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:27.208
But you never hurt anyone
except for that dreadful day.

01:24:29.166 --> 01:24:30.666
You think like my mother.

01:24:32.083 --> 01:24:35.041
"It's just one mistake, come on.
Let's just move on."

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:39.750
Heba, you and Mona made a lot of mistakes.

01:24:40.416 --> 01:24:41.833
You know that.

01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:43.750
But my mistake is bigger.

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:48.541
I watched you mock
and bully Amira every day.

01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:52.041
I was afraid to speak up.

01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:55.750
All the girls were scared
and silent about you bullying Amira.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.041
In the end,

01:24:58.625 --> 01:25:00.791
I dared to try and be like you too…

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.500
and I caused her death.

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:09.750
