00:26.300 --> 00:30.000
- So...

00:30.100 --> 00:33.700
when Glen and I first got married,

00:33.800 --> 00:39.900
his parents gave us,
as a wedding gift, um,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.850
a little house that they had
in Pennsylvania.

00:42.885 --> 00:45.700
They had it since
they were married back in,

00:45.735 --> 00:48.500
I don't know, '69,

00:48.600 --> 00:53.300
and now they spend their summers
in a bigger house

00:53.400 --> 00:57.100
that they moved into
that's right near the little house

00:57.200 --> 00:58.800
and I think that
they partly gave it to us

00:58.900 --> 01:01.200
so that they could see
Glen's kids more,

01:01.300 --> 01:05.700
since we would be spending
all of our summers right by them,

01:05.800 --> 01:12.600
uh, which I didn't mind at all,
because I liked them, and...

01:12.700 --> 01:16.600
And... I don't know.

01:16.700 --> 01:21.900
But after all the chapters
in my life being married to you,

01:22.000 --> 01:23.900
having the kids,

01:24.100 --> 01:28.800
the... whole mess, divorce,

01:28.900 --> 01:32.200
teaching public high school,

01:32.300 --> 01:35.500
I'd stopped really giving a shit about
my own personal space, you know?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.000
It was just like, well,
everybody, hey, come on in,

01:38.100 --> 01:41.200
you know, take whatever you want.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.000
So we started going there every summer.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.800
And it's really nice there.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.700
Just tall trees for days.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.100
Um, something about a place
that gets so cold in the winter,

01:52.135 --> 01:54.717
'cause in the summer,
there's all this moisture,

01:54.752 --> 01:57.300
and so there's still these pockets
of cool air,

01:57.335 --> 01:59.800
even in the hottest parts of the summer.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.400
I loved it.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.065
And...

02:06.100 --> 02:08.199
Glen's kids would romp

02:08.300 --> 02:13.000
and he loved taking them fishing,

02:13.100 --> 02:14.800
and there was a horse farm nearby

02:14.900 --> 02:18.500
and they would all borrow horses
and go riding

02:18.600 --> 02:21.700
and, uh, Roger and Beth,
Glen's parents,

02:21.800 --> 02:26.100
they would come over
almost every night for dinner.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.500
And it was real easy.
It, uh...

02:30.600 --> 02:33.500
I didn't mind
that it was all Glen's family,

02:33.600 --> 02:36.400
his parents, his kids, and then me.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.300
I was okay with that.

02:38.400 --> 02:43.800
I just thought, well, I can do this
for as long as it works.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.700
And it...

02:50.600 --> 02:52.300
Really...

02:52.400 --> 02:57.600
nothing ever went wrong,

02:57.700 --> 03:01.200
'cause nobody had any issues,

03:01.300 --> 03:06.200
Glen's kids and I, we-
we never had any bumps or...

03:09.200 --> 03:12.400
It was just real easy.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.600
And I used to love going
to sleep in the country

03:14.700 --> 03:17.700
with the bugs buzzing and frogs and...

03:17.800 --> 03:20.400
And then waking up in the quiet,

03:20.500 --> 03:22.900
'cause I used to get up before
anybody else did.

03:22.935 --> 03:24.600
That was my time.

03:24.700 --> 03:29.300
And so, also, Roger would come over
a lot, Glen's dad.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.100
He's real handy, Glen's not handy,
so Roger would come over

03:34.200 --> 03:37.500
and tend to stuff
around the little house,

03:37.600 --> 03:40.100
'cause I think he never really
let go of the feeling

03:40.200 --> 03:43.400
that that was still his to care for.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.800
And Beth, um...

03:46.900 --> 03:50.500
was just kinda quiet.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.500
Like together they're quiet,

03:52.600 --> 03:56.500
like their whole relationship is...

03:56.600 --> 03:58.400
kind of a secret.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.400
They would come over together
and sit and watch everybody

04:01.435 --> 04:03.900
with these two peaceful smiles
on their face,

04:03.935 --> 04:06.100
like they're already ghosts,

04:06.300 --> 04:08.700
silently watching over the grandkids,

04:08.800 --> 04:14.800
but by himself, Roger, he- he-
he would talk and tell stories.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.450
Uh, he...

04:17.485 --> 04:20.000
He's very...

04:20.100 --> 04:23.000
He has that kind of man's ego
from another time,

04:23.100 --> 04:25.100
when it wasn't considered
just being an asshole,

04:25.200 --> 04:26.900
when it was a virtue, you know,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.200
'cause he grew up in Michigan,
and I just think

04:30.235 --> 04:33.400
that it's really interesting
to know somebody

04:33.500 --> 04:35.600
that has a quarter-century
head start on you.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.900
It's like getting
to talk to a time machine.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.900
So he would come over and do
stuff around the house,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.700
and I'd make him coffee
and he would talk while he worked.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.800
And I would listen and laugh.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.200
He's really funny.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.000
And I'd watch him.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.100
I mean, he's 84.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.800
And in all those years,

04:57.900 --> 05:02.900
he never stopped using
his muscles, his body.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So he comes over and works

05:05.100 --> 05:10.300
and, um, usually takes
his shirt off after a while,

05:10.335 --> 05:13.900
and when you look at a man's
84-year-old body

05:14.000 --> 05:16.100
and you see the skin turn red

05:16.200 --> 05:20.000
and then sweaty with the work
that he's doing

05:20.035 --> 05:21.700
all of his life,

05:21.800 --> 05:24.700
and a man who doesn't have
to prove anything

05:24.800 --> 05:29.500
to anybody in that little house.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.800
He would tell me stories
about his past in the Navy

05:32.900 --> 05:34.600
and growing up on his parents' farm,

05:34.700 --> 05:39.200
but he- he didn't really care
that it was me that he was telling.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.500
He was just being social.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.900
He never looked at me much.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.565
But I would stare at him

05:45.600 --> 05:50.600
'cause I could,
'cause he wasn't looking back.

05:50.700 --> 05:55.300
So this one day when he comes over
to fix the porch boards,

05:55.400 --> 05:59.700
he drives up in this little
truck that he has.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.800
I can hear the truck
from all the way down the hill.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.200
The house is up on a little hill
and then there's nothing

06:05.300 --> 06:08.565
but woods between
their place and ours.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.500
And so whenever he comes,
I hear that little engine,

06:11.600 --> 06:17.300
I hear the- him switching his gears
when he comes up the hill.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.800
So it's morning and Glen's got
the kids out on the lake

06:21.900 --> 06:25.100
and I'm all alone
and I'm sunbathing out on the lawn,

06:25.200 --> 06:26.600
which feels stupid,

06:26.700 --> 06:29.300
but I just wanted to feel
the sun on my body

06:29.400 --> 06:32.365
and I'm alone, so who cares?

06:32.400 --> 06:37.600
And I'm laying back in the chaise
in my only bikini that I ever-

06:37.700 --> 06:42.150
that I ever, ever bought myself.

06:42.185 --> 06:46.565
And I just let my legs... go open,

06:46.600 --> 06:49.000
'cause I want the sun
on the inside of my thighs,

06:49.100 --> 06:53.600
and it just feels good
to be in the woods

06:53.800 --> 06:56.700
alone and letting the sun in,

06:56.800 --> 07:01.700
just splayed like a frog,
legs open and...

07:01.735 --> 07:04.300
letting the sun.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.200
And then I hear the little truck.

07:08.235 --> 07:11.800
I hear it, uh, coming.

07:11.900 --> 07:16.500
And I smile like I always do,
with my eyes closed.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.465
And I hear it getting nearer and nearer,

07:22.500 --> 07:28.100
and I think, well,
right where he's gonna pull in,

07:28.200 --> 07:29.900
he's gonna see me like that,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.200
and here I am with my legs open

07:32.300 --> 07:37.000
and I'd better close them
and lay here like a lady does.

07:37.035 --> 07:43.400
And then I thought,
oh, well, what if I don't?

07:43.500 --> 07:48.700
What if I lay here with my eyes closed
and my legs open

07:48.800 --> 07:51.800
and let him see?

07:51.900 --> 07:55.500
And...

07:55.600 --> 07:59.600
the thought of that, it re- it...

07:59.700 --> 08:04.400
made my heart go really fast.

08:04.500 --> 08:11.100
And I kept my eyes closed and...

08:11.300 --> 08:13.600
the closer that the sound
of that little truck got,

08:13.635 --> 08:18.167
the more...

08:18.202 --> 08:22.700
I got...

08:22.800 --> 08:24.200
Oh, my God.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.000
I just stayed there, and, uh...

08:30.100 --> 08:32.100
I tried to sort of make it look
like I was sleeping,

08:32.200 --> 08:34.100
but who sleeps like that?

08:34.200 --> 08:40.200
And- and I hear the truck pull
into the little space

08:40.299 --> 08:42.200
in front of the house

08:42.299 --> 08:45.500
and I have to- I-

08:45.600 --> 08:48.700
I was breathing so hard,

08:48.800 --> 08:54.000
I thought I was gonna have
an orgasm just laying there.

08:54.100 --> 08:58.500
And I hear the truck door squeak open
and slam shut,

08:58.600 --> 09:01.565
and I hear his feet in the grass.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.900
He'd take a step, then I hear him stop,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.300
so I know that he's standing there,
looking at me.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.800
And I let him.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.300
I just- I just let him look.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.900
And it was so...

09:18.000 --> 09:22.100
It was so dirty.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
I don't know, I don't know.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.800
- Why are you telling me this?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.400
- I know, I know, it's weird.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.200
- Yeah.
- I know, I know,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.800
'cause I mean, we haven't even
talked in years.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.300
Ever since Alice went
to college and 'cause now

09:35.400 --> 09:36.800
there finally hasn't been
any reason for us...

09:36.900 --> 09:39.000
- Yeah, I guess not.
- ... to talk.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.900
- Right.
- You probably think I hate you,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.700
and maybe sometimes I do, still,
a little bit.

09:43.735 --> 09:45.300
- Maybe I hate you, did you ever...?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.400
- Yeah, well, I don't know.
I'm sure you do.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.300
But I- can I just keep going?

09:50.400 --> 09:52.600
- Sure.

09:52.700 --> 09:55.865
- Okay.

09:55.900 --> 10:00.600
- You're laying on your back
with your legs open in a bikini

10:00.700 --> 10:04.700
and your new 84-year-old dad-in-law

10:04.800 --> 10:08.700
is looking between your legs.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.400
- So yes, he's looking.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.300
And, um...

10:12.400 --> 10:16.300
And I can tell because he's not moving,
so, yeah, he's...

10:16.400 --> 10:17.700
he's looking right at me.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.300
Now.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.700
Now, all I can think is,

10:21.800 --> 10:24.500
don't open your eyes, right?

10:24.600 --> 10:27.800
Because if you look back at him,
then you did this.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.165
You... That's it.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.165
And you can never take it back.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.800
And now you can't even close your legs

10:33.900 --> 10:36.100
because then you definitely
weren't sleeping,

10:36.200 --> 10:42.700
and what would Glen say
and sweet Beth and the kids?

10:42.800 --> 10:47.200
And I thought, I'm sick.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.100
I'm corrupt.

10:50.200 --> 10:56.100
I just should have left this
little family alone.

10:56.300 --> 11:00.000
Glen, he's pure, he's innocent.

11:00.100 --> 11:05.500
His wife died, is all,

11:05.600 --> 11:10.600
and he needed somebody,
and here I came,

11:10.700 --> 11:15.700
this fucked-up divorced older lady,

11:15.800 --> 11:20.300
and I'm showing half of my vagina
to his 84-year-old dad.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.700
- Did you open your eyes?
- No.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.100
No.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.300
I kept 'em closed.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.100
And he was there...

11:34.200 --> 11:37.900
a- a long time.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.300
I just felt him there.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.500
I...

11:47.800 --> 11:52.265
It was the most erotic thing ever,

11:52.300 --> 11:56.800
and after I don't even know
how long, um,

11:56.900 --> 12:00.300
I heard him start to unload wood
from the truck,

12:00.400 --> 12:03.300
so when that first plank of wood
hit the porch, I got up,

12:03.400 --> 12:05.700
I pulled a wrap on around my bottom,

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
I got up, I made him coffee,

12:07.900 --> 12:09.800
and just like always,
I watched him work.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.300
He told me stories,
but this time, when he talked to me,

12:12.400 --> 12:16.300
he looked right at me
and he asked me things

12:16.400 --> 12:21.100
and I talked and he listened and...

12:21.200 --> 12:24.000
And he listened very well.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.400
- Is that all that ever-
is that all that happened?

12:30.300 --> 12:33.200
- That's all that happened that day.

12:33.300 --> 12:38.000
I mean, that was it.
He... left,

12:38.100 --> 12:40.400
and I didn't even dare masturbate,

12:40.500 --> 12:42.900
because I knew that
it would just be too much.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.000
- What happened?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.400
- Okay.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.850
So... I didn't see him for a few days.

12:50.885 --> 12:54.200
Him and Beth didn't come over
for dinner.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.000
He didn't come over to fix anything.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.900
It was weird, not having
any contact with them

12:59.935 --> 13:02.600
and I got kinda scared,
even though I-

13:02.700 --> 13:05.400
I mean, what?
Nothing happened.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.100
But I couldn't think about
anything else.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.300
Glen and the kids and I,
we'd be having our time

13:11.400 --> 13:15.800
and... I'm miles away.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.400
I'd be in the kitchen

13:17.500 --> 13:20.565
watching Glen make something
he likes to cook,

13:20.600 --> 13:23.900
and I just kept staring out
the window at the chaise.

13:28.100 --> 13:34.100
So then, I think two days after that,
Roger calls the house,

13:34.135 --> 13:36.400
I pick up the phone,
he says, "Hi, Sarah,"

13:36.500 --> 13:41.100
I say, hey,
and my heart's pounding.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.800
It's pounding, and he says, um,

13:45.900 --> 13:48.500
"So I'm thinking about coming over
to paint the wainscoting

13:48.600 --> 13:51.600
"in the dining room tomorrow,
it's peeling.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.000
So is around 11:00
in the morning okay for you?"

13:55.035 --> 13:56.400
And see, here's the-

13:56.500 --> 13:59.300
The thing is, he never did that.
(clears throat)

13:59.400 --> 14:01.300
He never called before,
he just comes over.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.165
He never did that.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.600
So I just say, "Yeah, sure, Roger,
I'll see you then. "

14:05.700 --> 14:10.700
I hang up the phone
and Glen says, "What'd he say?"

14:10.800 --> 14:14.500
And so I told him what he said,

14:14.600 --> 14:17.700
exactly what he said.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.100
And I was lying to him.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.500
I mean, I never lied to him.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.300
I never- I never lied to a man,
that I remember.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.000
- You never lied to me.
- And here I am,

14:27.100 --> 14:29.200
telling Glen exactly what his dad said,

14:29.300 --> 14:31.400
and it was a big lie.

14:31.500 --> 14:35.400
And Glen just shrugged and said,
okay, and I thought,

14:35.500 --> 14:39.465
boy, the worst part about telling a lie

14:39.500 --> 14:42.500
is when someone that you love
just accepts it.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.900
- Yep.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.900
So he came over.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.000
- Well, oh, my God.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.500
That night, I- I- I said to Glen,

15:00.700 --> 15:04.200
well, first, you know,
I counted in my head

15:04.235 --> 15:07.700
like how much time should go by
after the call,

15:07.800 --> 15:11.300
and then I open my mouth to suggest
that Glen take the kids to the lake,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.300
and I thought, what the hell?

15:13.400 --> 15:14.700
- Mm-hmm.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.800
- Come-
What the hell are you doing?

15:17.900 --> 15:20.000
You know, am I really gonna do this?

15:20.100 --> 15:23.600
'Cause that- that would really be
doing something, to get rid of Glen.

15:23.635 --> 15:25.200
- Yep.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.500
- And I told myself,
you haven't done anything.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.200
Nothing happened.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.400
So I decide to do the opposite
and I say to Glen,

15:32.500 --> 15:34.000
"Hey, what do you want
to do tomorrow?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.600
Should we all go into town?"

15:35.635 --> 15:37.400
And he goes, "No.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.100
I already booked horses for me
and the kids, starting at 7:00."

15:41.135 --> 15:43.300
(Horace chuckles)

15:43.400 --> 15:45.265
- Of all...

15:45.300 --> 15:48.700
So, and then all I had to do was go-

15:48.800 --> 15:51.100
just nod my head up and down
and say, sure,

15:51.200 --> 15:55.800
and so the next morning, they leave
and now it's getting close to 11:00

15:55.835 --> 15:59.967
and I don't know what to do.
What do I do? What do-

16:00.002 --> 16:04.100
Do I put on the bikini
and assume the position?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.600
I don't know, what do I-

16:05.700 --> 16:07.900
I don't want to do anything.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.900
I do not want any of this to be
happening, but at the same time,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.700
I felt like I needed to see it through,

16:13.800 --> 16:15.800
because he called
and said that he was coming

16:15.900 --> 16:17.900
and he doesn't do that because
it- so it just-

16:18.000 --> 16:23.100
It sounded like he wanted it
to happen again.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.800
So I put on the old bikini, and then-

16:25.900 --> 16:28.500
Oh, Horace, this is the worst.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.200
I had the most awful thought.

16:30.235 --> 16:31.900
- What?

16:32.000 --> 16:37.100
- I thought that when he saw me there
that first time,

16:37.200 --> 16:39.000
he didn't like it.

16:39.100 --> 16:42.900
He thought that it was gross
and he thought that it was shameful

16:43.000 --> 16:44.600
and he thought that it was awful

16:44.635 --> 16:46.165
and the reason that he stopped

16:46.200 --> 16:48.100
was because he thought
that I was sleeping.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.600
He didn't want to wake me up

16:49.700 --> 16:51.800
because he didn't want to have me
feel ashamed,

16:51.900 --> 16:54.500
and that the reason
that he had called the house

16:54.600 --> 16:57.600
was that so I would have a warning
that he was coming

16:57.700 --> 16:59.400
so that it wouldn't happen again,

16:59.500 --> 17:02.300
because he's a decent man
and I'm a whore.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.900
And I hear the truck,
and I am so afraid, I run upstairs,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.200
I start changing my clothes.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.000
I am in a panic, I'm-

17:10.099 --> 17:12.900
I'm literally trying to figure out,
what does a woman wear

17:12.935 --> 17:15.599
who's trying not to fuck
the old guy down the hill

17:15.700 --> 17:19.200
who gave birth to her new husband?

17:19.300 --> 17:20.800
(Horace laughs)

17:20.900 --> 17:23.099
- So he comes in the house

17:23.200 --> 17:24.900
and he's-
he's- he's down there.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.865
And I hear him call out,
hi, hello?

17:27.900 --> 17:32.400
And I'm standing upstairs
in my bra and panties

17:32.435 --> 17:34.700
and I yell out, "Hi, Roger!"

17:34.800 --> 17:36.700
And he calls up, said,
"I'm just gonna get started,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.400
work down here. "

17:38.500 --> 17:41.400
And I yelled down,
"Yeah, sure. "

17:41.500 --> 17:46.100
And I hear him starting to work.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.900
And I...

17:49.000 --> 17:54.500
stood there in my underwear
listening to him shuffle around,

17:54.600 --> 17:58.800
popping open the paint can,
stirring it.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.700
And...

18:00.800 --> 18:05.300
all of the blood that had been
running through my body

18:05.400 --> 18:11.000
all that time went right
between my legs and...

18:11.100 --> 18:14.900
(chuckling)

18:15.000 --> 18:20.800
I laid down on my bed,
and this house is so old, so small, so-

18:20.835 --> 18:25.465
The walls are thin,
the floors are thin.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.300
When I laid down on the bed,
it made this noise,

18:28.400 --> 18:33.400
and he's in the room right below me,

18:33.500 --> 18:38.800
and I hear the brush stop

18:38.900 --> 18:42.500
when the bed creaks
and then start again,

18:42.600 --> 18:48.000
and I start running my hands...

18:51.200 --> 18:55.500
...on myself all over and...

18:55.600 --> 19:00.300
I mean, he's, what, maybe
like 10 feet away from me,

19:00.335 --> 19:02.300
vertically,

19:02.400 --> 19:04.900
and I'm this dirty woman
touching myself

19:05.100 --> 19:07.400
and I can hear him working,

19:07.500 --> 19:10.900
but very quietly,

19:11.000 --> 19:15.600
so my heart is pounding
and I made a sound- I-

19:15.700 --> 19:20.400
I made a sound, like a little moan.

19:20.500 --> 19:24.400
And then, I hear the brush stop.

19:24.435 --> 19:27.000
And then start.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.300
And then I just-

19:28.400 --> 19:30.300
I let myself get a little bit louder,

19:30.400 --> 19:33.400
and now I hear him put down
the brush, stand up,

19:33.500 --> 19:39.100
my heart's pounding,
I- I- I stop, I mean, I freeze.

19:39.200 --> 19:44.200
I hear him pull a chair out from
the table and sit down,

19:44.300 --> 19:47.700
'cause I hear the old wood
of the chair creak

19:47.735 --> 19:51.065
and settle under him
and- and, um... (chuckles)

19:51.100 --> 19:57.100
And then I hear, like rustling
of clothes and then nothing,

19:57.200 --> 20:01.000
and- and I know
that he's sitting in that chair,

20:01.100 --> 20:05.200
not moving, and that's all
that I know.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.000
So my heart's-
- Did he take his dick out?

20:07.100 --> 20:09.400
- I...

20:09.500 --> 20:11.600
I start touching myself,

20:11.700 --> 20:16.900
and I let my- my own sounds

20:17.000 --> 20:19.065
drowned out his,

20:19.100 --> 20:21.900
and I assume that he's doing
the same,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.500
but of course,
I don't know, I don't know.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.300
I- I don't know anything that's-

20:27.500 --> 20:29.900
I mean, for all I know,
he's guessing what I'm doing up there

20:30.000 --> 20:31.900
and the poor guy is sitting down there
just totally shocked,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.700
or he has no idea
that any of this is going on

20:35.800 --> 20:38.800
and all of this is just making me crazy.

20:38.900 --> 20:42.900
I'm full-on masturbating,
I came like crazy.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.600
I...

20:46.700 --> 20:49.100
I- I- I might have been loud,

20:49.200 --> 20:51.800
I might've not even made
any noise at all.

20:51.900 --> 20:56.200
I couldn't even tell you,
but my God, Horace,

20:56.235 --> 20:59.200
it was a lot.

20:59.300 --> 21:05.465
And I hear him, um, uh,

21:05.500 --> 21:09.100
stand up, then, from the chair
and go back to work,

21:09.200 --> 21:13.400
so I put my clothes on
and- and I go in the bathroom,

21:13.500 --> 21:16.000
I'm running the water, you know,
I'm just trying to be normal,

21:16.100 --> 21:18.200
I'm trying to be normal, loud,
footsteps, loud, loud,

21:18.235 --> 21:19.800
and all, ahh, ahh.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.200
You know, I come downstairs

21:21.300 --> 21:25.800
and, um, and we talk,

21:25.900 --> 21:28.400
we listen to each other.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.100
Um...

21:31.200 --> 21:32.900
He takes his shirt off.
(chuckles)

21:33.000 --> 21:34.600
I watch him work.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.700
When he's done, he leaves.

21:37.735 --> 21:40.700
That was... three months ago.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.400
- Holy fuck.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.700
So did you guys ever fuck or what?

21:53.700 --> 21:57.300
- I mean, Horace.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.765
Oh, do you know how...

21:59.800 --> 22:03.100
how horrible it would be
if Glen found out

22:03.200 --> 22:05.500
and Beth and the kids and...

22:05.600 --> 22:09.400
And even more, I mean, it would
just like be the end of life.

22:09.500 --> 22:13.000
- Sounds like you guys are fucking.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.400
Oh, shit.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.900
- I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.200
I- I can't stop, and...

22:23.600 --> 22:26.500
I mean, if I don't stop,

22:26.600 --> 22:30.500
then all these people are
gonna get so hurt.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.400
I just want to die.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.800
Just the other night, I-
I cried so hard till morning,

22:38.835 --> 22:42.800
and, um, I thought-

22:42.900 --> 22:46.100
I just felt like my back was
against a bed of rusty nails.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.500
- Oh, Sarah.
- And I thought of you, Horace,

22:49.600 --> 22:52.900
and I thought of how when I found out
about you and Rosemary

22:53.000 --> 22:54.900
and how much I hated you and how-

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
And how could you do that
to the family, you know,

22:58.100 --> 23:00.600
to the kids and to me and to yourself?

23:00.700 --> 23:04.800
And then- and then, I was like,
oh, Jesus Christ.

23:04.900 --> 23:09.700
The guy was 21, I was 32,
and I married him.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.800
I mean, I made him marry me.

23:11.900 --> 23:14.200
It's not that hard to make a guy
that age do what you want.

23:14.300 --> 23:18.550
He's so used to still listening
to his mother.

23:18.585 --> 23:22.800
And so, I just thought,
how was that like for you?

23:22.900 --> 23:28.200
'Cause, I mean, I had never
thought about how-

23:28.300 --> 23:30.100
How was it like for you?

23:32.400 --> 23:35.400
- So you thought that maybe
I could help you now

23:35.500 --> 23:37.600
because I went through it
when I cheated on you?

23:37.700 --> 23:39.700
- Yeah.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.165
- Wow.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.900
Well, that's... (scoffs)

23:50.300 --> 23:52.000
Can you give me a minute?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.000
I'll be right back.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.700
â™ªâ™ª

24:07.400 --> 24:10.400
(man humming)

24:33.300 --> 24:36.100
- â™ª Horace and Pete â™ª

24:44.900 --> 24:46.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.000
What, did you go jerk off
or something?

24:48.100 --> 24:49.800
- Ha.
- Ha ha.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.800
- Well, my head is clear now.
- Okay.

24:51.900 --> 24:56.465
- Yeah.
- And- and I am sorry.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.800
- Okay, it's all right, it's all right.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.200
So you're in a- you're in
a pretty fucked up situation.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.600
- Yes, I am, yes, I am.
- Well, I know how that feels.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.400
- Yes, you do.
That's why-

25:08.500 --> 25:13.000
- Okay, well, look, Sarah.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.900
I mean...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
you know, it's funny,
we never talked about it.

25:18.035 --> 25:19.400
- That's true.

25:22.100 --> 25:26.500
- Well, look, let me-
let me just say this off the bat, okay?

25:26.600 --> 25:29.400
If you keep doing this with this guy,

25:29.500 --> 25:32.800
and I'm not judging you,
obviously.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.900
I mean, people do what they-
they do what they do.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.300
But you really have two choices.
- Mm-hmm.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.600
- Stop and forget about it,

25:44.700 --> 25:49.800
or keep doing it, in which case,
everybody's gonna know.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.400
- Oh, my God.
- Well, come on, Sarah.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.650
There's no other way.

25:54.685 --> 25:56.700
I mean, you know it.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.200
If you keep fucking this guy,
someone's gonna find out,

26:00.300 --> 26:03.600
which means
everyone's gonna find out,

26:03.700 --> 26:06.500
and then all the worst things
that you're imagining,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.500
they're all gonna happen.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
So if you keep doing it-

26:10.700 --> 26:14.365
And again, God bless,
do what you gotta do.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.000
But it's all gonna happen,
all that awful stuff,

26:17.100 --> 26:19.600
so you need to reconcile with that

26:19.700 --> 26:21.800
and start thinking about how
you're gonna deal with it,

26:21.900 --> 26:25.000
or stop.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.300
- That's not really a choice.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.100
- Yeah, I know.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
None of it is a choice.
You can't stop.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.800
- No.
- I know.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.600
- I mean, he's just beautiful,
he smells good.

26:35.635 --> 26:38.300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
- I- I- I-

26:38.400 --> 26:42.500
I know what you're saying is true.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.200
I know what I need to do.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.100
I can't do it.

26:47.200 --> 26:51.000
So I'm not asking what I should do.

26:51.100 --> 26:55.400
- You're asking...

26:55.500 --> 26:58.300
How did I not kill myself?

27:00.200 --> 27:01.500
Jesus.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.800
I remember feeling like that.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.000
That was- that's a...

27:08.100 --> 27:10.100
That's a bad feeling.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.900
I mean, you're doing something that-

27:17.000 --> 27:20.100
I was doing something

27:20.200 --> 27:23.000
that was the end
of absolutely everything

27:23.035 --> 27:25.200
and I kept- I kept doing it.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.700
- Yeah.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.100
- I never thought about killing myself,

27:31.200 --> 27:35.300
but I used to have fantasies
about something happening to me,

27:35.400 --> 27:40.700
you know, like getting hit by a truck
or falling off a cliff.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.700
That's a bad feeling.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.465
So, well...

27:49.500 --> 27:54.500
I met your sister...

27:54.600 --> 27:56.700
when we started dating.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.000
Like we were dating for about a month,
right before we got married.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.900
- And I cannot believe
we got married that quick.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.700
- Yeah, that was dumb.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.400
I don't know, it was just-
I don't know.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.700
- So...
- So...

28:08.735 --> 28:11.900
you remember...

28:12.000 --> 28:13.900
I went to dinner with you
and your family?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.965
- Mm-hmm, sure.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.600
- Do you want to hear this?
- Sure.

28:20.700 --> 28:25.100
- Okay, so that's when I first met her,
was at that dinner,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.000
and I- I forgot- I don't know why,

28:27.100 --> 28:30.400
but I asked her why she-
when she graduated high school,

28:30.500 --> 28:33.700
and you made that joke, you said,
"She's your age, Horace. "

28:33.800 --> 28:37.600
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I remember that.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.400
- This doesn't bother you
to hear about this?

28:39.500 --> 28:42.100
- No, it's helping me.
I think it's-

28:42.135 --> 28:44.000
- Did you forgive me or-

28:44.100 --> 28:46.600
- No.
No, I never did.

28:46.700 --> 28:48.265
I stayed mad at you for years.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.000
Why would I forgive you
for fucking my sister?

28:50.100 --> 28:53.100
Breaking apart the family?
Doing that to the kids?

28:53.135 --> 28:54.800
- Just, you don't seem mad anymore.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.600
- I'm not, it just went away.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.800
It's kinda sad.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.900
Um...

29:02.000 --> 29:03.600
No, I was so mad at you,

29:03.700 --> 29:05.600
I would walk around all day
with these bad feelings,

29:05.700 --> 29:10.800
about what you did
and I thought, well, someday,

29:10.900 --> 29:13.600
something'll happen, you know,

29:13.700 --> 29:18.100
I'll be overcome by a wave of kindness,
or I'll just-

29:18.200 --> 29:21.000
or I'll just figure out
a different way to look at it

29:21.035 --> 29:23.800
and I'll forgive you and I'll feel good,
but instead,

29:23.900 --> 29:27.500
what happens is,
time just takes the feelings away,

29:27.600 --> 29:33.100
they just kinda get dim
with time going by,

29:33.200 --> 29:36.000
they just go away
and you don't get to figure it out.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.000
It's like erosion, it just goes away.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.400
It's kinda sad.
- Yeah.

29:40.500 --> 29:44.600
- Anyway, uh, I don't feel anything
about it, Horace.

29:44.700 --> 29:50.100
But, well, all that's left is,
I'm curious how you got through it.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.400
- Okay.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.900
So, Rosemary.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.300
You know, I never thought about her
that way when I first met her.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.900
I mean, she was all right.
She was your sister.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.700
And then... (chuckling)

30:13.800 --> 30:15.900
Shit.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.100
- Yes?
(Horace exhales)

30:18.200 --> 30:22.900
- Well, then we got married,

30:23.000 --> 30:27.200
and then one day, you were at work

30:27.300 --> 30:31.200
and I was home,
and she came over to get something,

30:31.300 --> 30:36.700
I don't remember what,
and we fucked.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.400
- So that's it?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.500
- Yeah, I mean, it's not
a cool story like yours.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.500
But, um...

30:42.600 --> 30:44.300
Maybe it was, I don't remember.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.800
Anyway, once we figured that out,

30:49.900 --> 30:53.500
that we were into fucking each other
and not telling anybody,

30:53.600 --> 30:56.200
we started to do it a lot.

30:56.300 --> 30:59.100
And after a while,
we couldn't stop doing it.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.700
- Oh, God.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.500
- Yeah, it was a lot of fucking.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.500
A lot.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.200
And then, just the worst...

31:07.300 --> 31:10.900
The worst, worst, worst, worst,
worst feeling

31:11.000 --> 31:12.900
in the whole wide fucking world.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.365
- Yeah.

31:15.400 --> 31:19.700
- I would lie awake next to you,

31:19.900 --> 31:24.000
just thinking,
what if she finds out?

31:24.100 --> 31:27.000
Like scared, like what if
she finds out?

31:27.100 --> 31:29.600
And then all the shit
with the kids when they were born.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.800
- Horace...
(chuckles)

31:31.900 --> 31:34.200
- Well, I couldn't have been
doing a worse thing.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.650
I couldn't have been doing
a worse thing.

31:36.685 --> 31:39.000
It was the worst thing I could ever do.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.800
And I kept doing it.

31:40.835 --> 31:42.900
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.400
- And every day, every single day,

31:45.500 --> 31:48.400
I would think,
I don't want to be alive.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.400
I just want it all to end.

31:50.500 --> 31:53.000
Not just me,
I wanted us all to die.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.800
- Oh, Jesus.

31:54.900 --> 31:58.400
- Well, I wanted everybody
involved in any way

31:58.500 --> 32:00.265
to just stop existing.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.965
It was the only clean way out.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
I remember on 9/11 when
the planes had hit the buildings

32:06.100 --> 32:09.000
and on the news they said that
Washington was on fire

32:09.100 --> 32:10.800
and there was-

32:10.900 --> 32:12.100
Remember, everybody thought
there was more planes coming?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.500
- Yeah, God.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.800
- I thought,
maybe this is it, maybe...

32:15.900 --> 32:19.000
maybe the planes will take us out
and this will all be over.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.900
- Oh, that's... horrible.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.700
It's horrible.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.300
- Well, I preferred that
to what I knew would happen, and did,

32:27.400 --> 32:30.000
that everybody would find out
what I was doing.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.700
- Mm-hmm.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.300
- I would picture you finding out.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.300
Like I would close my eyes
and I'd picture your face

32:37.400 --> 32:40.500
and I'd see all this hate in your eyes

32:40.600 --> 32:44.000
that I knew I could never
come back from,

32:44.100 --> 32:47.700
and I kept on fucking her,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.600
and you hated me anyway.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.400
- What?
- You hated me.

32:52.500 --> 32:56.000
- Horace, you thought
I hated you before we broke up?

32:56.100 --> 32:58.300
I didn't hate you.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.200
I didn't.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.900
- Yeah, I kinda know that now.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.900
I mean, come on, honey,
we were-

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I was 21, you were 32.

33:17.200 --> 33:21.400
- Well, you know, Horace,
aside from all of that,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.800
you were never
anything but nice to me.

33:23.900 --> 33:29.000
I mean, like just daily life,
like, you know,

33:29.100 --> 33:30.900
all that time,
you were always just nice

33:31.000 --> 33:33.800
and I do wish that I had put
a higher value on that than I did.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.600
I- Maybe that's a part of the reason.

33:35.700 --> 33:38.700
- Sarah, I fucked your sister.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.100
That's the story, okay?
That's what happened.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.900
- Yeah.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.800
- We don't have to dig
any deeper than that.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.200
- No, that- that does make it
a lot easier, doesn't it?

33:47.300 --> 33:50.200
- Well, that's why people
do stuff like that, like this.

33:50.300 --> 33:53.200
Because then you don't have
to go through all the muck.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.500
Otherwise, you have to go
through all the muck,

33:55.600 --> 33:58.700
and nobody can do that,
so you just...

33:58.800 --> 34:01.400
In a bad marriage?
Fuck a relative and get out.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.200
It works.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.000
It's like an insurance fire.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.900
And you know, when a building
burns to the ground,

34:07.000 --> 34:08.199
nobody asks any questions,

34:08.300 --> 34:10.000
you just gotta really burn it down.

34:10.100 --> 34:14.199
- I don't even know why
I'm laughing.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.000
- Come on.

34:16.100 --> 34:17.699
Like let's get real.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.900
Sarah, you know what you should do?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
You want to know the truth?
You should get out.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.400
You should leave Glen and get out.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.199
That's what you're doing anyway
by fucking his dad,

34:27.235 --> 34:28.699
you're getting out.
- I can't do it.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.300
I can't, I can't.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
No, ahh, I have to face it,
I have to fix it.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.100
- That is facing it.
That's facing it.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.100
Get out and then
the whole mess is fixed.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.199
That's the fix.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.100
- Well, but I can-

34:40.199 --> 34:42.400
I- I can stop.
I can stop with Roger.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.699
That's what a good person would do.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.400
That's what I'm called on to do.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.600
Don't just throw up your hands,
say, oh, well, I-

34:49.699 --> 34:52.000
You know, I do this awful thing,
so come what may.

34:52.100 --> 34:55.900
You have to correct your behavior,
and you have to strive to be better

34:56.000 --> 34:57.100
for the people in your life.
- Okay.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.900
Sarah, tell yourself the story

34:59.000 --> 35:00.400
where you've been fucking this guy
as long as you have

35:00.500 --> 35:02.165
and then all of a sudden,
you just stop,

35:02.200 --> 35:04.600
and then you just go back to one
big happy family every Christmas

35:04.700 --> 35:07.500
and Easter in your house
in the woods, is that-

35:07.600 --> 35:09.800
Do you see that future?
- No, no.

35:09.900 --> 35:13.600
- You gotta get out.
You gotta get out.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.800
- I- I don't want-

35:15.900 --> 35:17.800
I don't want to have another divorce.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.500
Horace, I can't take it,
I mean, ours was what it was.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.200
I don't blame you,
I don't blame me,

35:23.400 --> 35:26.500
it just happened,
but if it happens to me again,

35:26.600 --> 35:28.265
what does that say?

35:28.300 --> 35:31.100
- It says that you're shitty
at being married.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.565
It's okay, so am I.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.300
That doesn't make you a bad person.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.900
Just don't be married.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.800
Just get out
and don't do it again.

35:39.835 --> 35:42.000
Just be alone, like me.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.100
You can't stay in this fucking thing

35:44.200 --> 35:47.900
just to try to make the truth
not be true.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.700
That's insane, that's- that's Catholic.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.000
- Those kids love me,
they really do,

35:53.100 --> 35:56.000
and I love them, and- and-
and they lost their mother.

35:56.100 --> 36:00.200
How do I now just- just pull
out of their life so violently

36:00.300 --> 36:02.700
in such a terrible way?
I'd have to be a terrible person.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.500
- You had your kids.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.900
You had your kids, okay?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.100
And you raised your kids.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.300
Their- their dad...

36:12.400 --> 36:15.300
fucked the family up.

36:15.400 --> 36:19.600
You stayed and saw them through
their childhood, okay?

36:19.700 --> 36:22.800
Those are Glen's kids, not yours,

36:22.900 --> 36:24.900
and they lost their mom.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.400
That's what happened to them.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.650
Bu anything you give them is plus.

36:28.685 --> 36:30.800
They got to be with you, okay?

36:30.900 --> 36:33.200
If you leave, it doesn't mean
that they give that back.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.500
Just because you pull out
doesn't mean that you weren't-

36:35.600 --> 36:36.600
that you were never there.

36:39.300 --> 36:43.300
- Boy, you really have a skill
at justifying horrible things.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.600
- Yeah.

36:49.100 --> 36:51.000
- I don't know what to do.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.100
- No, you don't.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.300
(sighing)
- Oh, God.

37:06.900 --> 37:11.200
- All right, well,
here's what you gotta do.

37:11.300 --> 37:14.400
This is what you gotta do,
you might as well do it.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.700
Go back and keep fucking Roger.

37:17.800 --> 37:22.500
Keep loving Glen and the kids.

37:22.600 --> 37:26.700
Just do both things as long as you can
as well as you can.

37:26.735 --> 37:29.300
That's what you're gonna do.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.900
You know that's
what you're gonna do,

37:31.000 --> 37:32.200
so you just might as well decide
you're gonna do it.

37:32.235 --> 37:35.100
- Yeah.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.200
(sniffles)
Yep.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.000
Oh, my God.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.600
(shuddering)
What am I?

37:44.700 --> 37:48.000
- You're just like a whole bunch
of other people, Sarah.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.200
Like a lot of other people.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.365
Like you could field an army

37:54.400 --> 37:58.000
with how many people have been
in your situation.

37:58.100 --> 38:01.900
Literally, you could gather
the cheaters of the world,

38:02.000 --> 38:05.900
and you could wage war
on the honest and you'd win.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.500
- Oh, God, you're awful.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.200
- You're gonna be okay,
you know.

38:12.300 --> 38:14.500
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, Sarah.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.300
- Well, I don't know how
you know that.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.600
- Because,
you know how I know it?

38:18.700 --> 38:20.500
'Cause I'm okay.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.400
And I was right where you are,
and I'm okay.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.800
- What about Glen?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.800
- He'll be okay, too,

38:26.900 --> 38:31.300
because he is where you were,
and you're okay.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.100
- Yeah.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.500
- And his kids will be fine,
'cause look at our kids.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.100
(chuckling)
Fuck.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.965
How is he?

38:51.000 --> 38:52.700
I know, I mean,
I follow him on Instagram

38:52.800 --> 38:54.800
so I know...
- Yeah.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.700
- ... he's on a lacrosse team

38:56.800 --> 39:00.300
and he went to Peru
with his natural history class,

39:00.400 --> 39:02.300
but how is he?
- Well, I-

39:02.400 --> 39:03.900
(clears throat)

39:04.000 --> 39:06.800
He made me promise
not to talk to you about him.

39:06.835 --> 39:09.465
- Oh, okay.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.800
Did he-
He knew you were coming here

39:11.900 --> 39:14.500
to tell me that you're fucking
your new husband's dad?

39:14.600 --> 39:17.600
- Ehh.
- Well, ouch, okay?

39:17.700 --> 39:19.100
I mean...

39:19.200 --> 39:20.800
Fuck, man.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.200
I get it, I got it coming,
but it fucking hurts.

39:23.300 --> 39:24.900
That's...

39:25.000 --> 39:26.500
- So I'm honoring his...

39:26.700 --> 39:30.100
promise in the sense that,
you know,

39:30.135 --> 39:31.400
I'm telling you about it.

39:31.500 --> 39:35.400
I- I do owe him that,
but I think that you should know,

39:35.435 --> 39:38.600
your son is doing really great.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.065
I mean, he's great.

39:46.100 --> 39:50.100
He's a lovely guy, Horace.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.400
He- he- he-

39:53.500 --> 39:57.800
He's nice to everybody
and it's genuine.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.800
He's got a girl, terrific.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.400
She's terrific.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.600
And he likes life.

40:09.500 --> 40:13.000
And, um, he's... (clears throat)

40:13.100 --> 40:14.900
thoughtful.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.200
He... picks good friends.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.400
He's really good with tough things,

40:20.500 --> 40:25.100
and so he's doing really good.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.650
- Thanks.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.100
- Yeah.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.100
- I'm really blowing it with Alice.

40:33.135 --> 40:34.700
She's always pissed at me.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.100
- Oh, well, you know,
she just needs to stop already.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.865
I don't even-

40:38.900 --> 40:41.200
How long does she think
she gets to stay a kid?

40:41.300 --> 40:44.200
- Well...
- No, Hor- No.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.565
I mean, she's almost a lawyer now.

40:46.600 --> 40:51.400
You- you are making an effort
to be in her life.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.700
Nobody owes her any more than that.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.600
She's being a big fat brat.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.800
- Jesus, wow.
- Well, I-

40:57.900 --> 41:00.500
I can't- I can't with that.

41:00.600 --> 41:04.200
I can't with that one.
That's enough, I...

41:04.300 --> 41:06.600
- All right, I'll take it.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.400
I didn't really...
(clears throat)

41:10.500 --> 41:11.800
I didn't really know, you know,

41:11.900 --> 41:14.000
what I was throwing away
with those guys.

41:14.100 --> 41:16.900
- You still don't know, Horace,
but forgive yourself.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.600
And- and- and you want
to know something?

41:20.700 --> 41:25.400
I'm happy for you,
'cause I think that you found peace.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.900
I wish that I could do it.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.465
I can't, I'm weak,
'cause I need somebody.

41:30.500 --> 41:35.600
And it takes a strength
and a self-acceptance to be alone

41:35.700 --> 41:37.665
and I really do-
I feel like you found it

41:37.700 --> 41:40.500
and you're living your truth,
you're living honestly

41:40.600 --> 41:43.700
and- and...

41:43.800 --> 41:47.000
So... I'm proud of you.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.600
I'm just... (sniffles)

41:51.700 --> 41:53.600
I'm really happy for you.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.800
So long, hon.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.300
- Bye, Sarah, see you.
- Take care.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.600
- Okay.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.700
- I can't believe you married that cunt.

42:19.500 --> 42:22.500
â™ªâ™ª

42:28.600 --> 42:33.100
- â™ª Hell no â™ª

42:33.200 --> 42:40.000
â™ª I can't complain about my problems â™ª

42:40.100 --> 42:44.600
â™ª I'm okay the way things are â™ª

42:46.600 --> 42:52.300
â™ª I pull my stool up to the bar â™ª

42:53.700 --> 42:57.300
â™ª At Horace and Pete's â™ª

43:00.700 --> 43:06.200
â™ª Sometimes I wonder â™ª

43:06.300 --> 43:12.000
â™ª Why do we tear ourselves to pieces? â™ª

43:12.100 --> 43:18.200
â™ª I just need some time
to think â™ª

43:18.300 --> 43:23.800
â™ª Or maybe I just need a drink â™ª

43:25.900 --> 43:30.800
â™ª At Horace and Pete's â™ª

43:30.900 --> 43:33.900
â™ªâ™ª

43:37.900 --> 43:41.400
â™ª Horace and Pete â™ªâ™ª

43:43.800 --> 43:45.800
