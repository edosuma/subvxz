WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.740
<i>Previously on "zero hour"...</i>

00:01.775 --> 00:03.344
they didn't want the cross.

00:03.380 --> 00:06.460
You think they're after
the blood of christ?

00:06.495 --> 00:08.757
A blueprint
for the son of god.

00:08.792 --> 00:10.606
why would laila
betray hank?

00:10.641 --> 00:12.385
my position
with the shepherds

00:12.420 --> 00:15.220
Requires that I follow orders
on blind faith.

00:15.255 --> 00:18.020
Regardless of what I've done,
what I am doing now

00:18.055 --> 00:19.865
I'm doing to save your life.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.580
And when the time comes,
I won't flinch.

00:23.615 --> 00:24.665
your father achieved

00:24.700 --> 00:26.060
The first cloning
of a human being.

00:26.095 --> 00:27.785
<i>He created you.</i>

00:27.820 --> 00:30.780
You were the only man who could
complete this project.

00:30.815 --> 00:32.797
dad risked his life
for me.

00:32.832 --> 00:34.780
We are going to rescue him.

<i>10 is the number of completion.</i>

00:48.915 --> 00:51.885
<i>The road to christ is nigh.</i>

00:51.920 --> 00:54.765
<i>The path must now be walked.</i>

00:54.800 --> 00:57.680
<i>But the one you love
will die.</i>

01:00.600 --> 01:02.445
see that
inscription at the base?

01:02.480 --> 01:06.320
Where jesus throws the money
changers out of the temple.

01:06.355 --> 01:07.645
And what does it mean?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.600
So look what's happening
back in the u.S.,

01:09.635 --> 01:11.045
With paulson, bernanke,

01:11.080 --> 01:13.000
And your
collapsing stock markets.

01:13.035 --> 01:14.885
I'm telling you,
it's all connected.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.280
That locust, it isn't
just counting minutes.

01:17.315 --> 01:18.997
It's counting down.

01:19.032 --> 01:20.680
To the end of time?

01:20.715 --> 01:22.337
Got it.

01:22.372 --> 01:23.925
Thank you.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.600
You're really
writing that down?

01:26.635 --> 01:28.360
It's part of my job.

01:28.395 --> 01:29.445
Oh.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.660
"modern skeptic" magazine.

01:30.695 --> 01:31.840
Maybe you've heard
about us.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.125
Sorry.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.245
I don't want to brag,

01:34.280 --> 01:37.680
With men who are living
in their parents' basements.

01:37.715 --> 01:38.925
oh, really?

01:38.960 --> 01:40.240
Well, yeah, I've dated
a few of those.

01:40.275 --> 01:42.040
They never mentioned it
to me.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.020
Okay, you're clearly not
a conspiracy nut.

01:46.055 --> 01:48.720
What brings you
to see "the time eater"?

01:48.755 --> 01:51.040
I sort of have a thing
for clocks.

01:51.075 --> 01:53.325
I repair them, restore them.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.440
Do you know this one
is only accurate

01:55.475 --> 01:57.765
Once every five minutes?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.205
So all these people
have come here

01:59.240 --> 02:01.380
To see a clock
that doesn't actually work?

02:01.415 --> 02:03.520
Well, apparently,
it was designed that way

02:03.555 --> 02:06.325
To reflect
life's irregularity.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.620
Come on. Don't you think
perfection's boring?

02:08.655 --> 02:10.880
Personally, I've always been
more interested

02:10.914 --> 02:12.800
In things with flaws.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.740
Hank galliston.

02:15.775 --> 02:16.965
Laila.
Hi.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.400
Nice to meet you.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.685
Where am I?

02:38.720 --> 02:42.000
You are exactly
where you need to be.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.080
Too bad there'll be
no help coming for you.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.125
Who is it?

03:02.160 --> 03:04.640
It's laila.
Open the door.

03:04.675 --> 03:06.077
What's wrong?

03:06.112 --> 03:07.480
It's hank.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.720
He's been in an accident.

03:09.755 --> 03:10.757
How do you know?

03:10.792 --> 03:11.725
Because I heard it.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.140
<i>Listen, give me a call
when you get this, okay?</i>

03:14.175 --> 03:16.520
<i>I think I know
how to find my dad.</i>

03:21.760 --> 03:23.680
And then it's pretty quiet
for a few minutes,

03:23.715 --> 03:25.120
Until this.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.400
A helicopter.

03:28.435 --> 03:29.645
yeah.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.445
Then it goes ghost on us.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.240
Can you pull any more
out of that static-

03:33.275 --> 03:35.045
Voices, background noises?

03:35.080 --> 03:36.360
I can try,
but there's so much-

03:36.395 --> 03:38.285
D-don't try. Just do.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.960
If we're gonna find hank,
we need a lot more to go on.

03:40.995 --> 03:42.880
You guys head back
to the office,

03:42.915 --> 03:43.965
Dig through hank's stuff,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.360
Try and figure out
where he was headed.

03:45.395 --> 03:46.720
What does it matter
where he's headed?

03:46.755 --> 03:48.205
We need to find out
where he is.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.280
Laila, with that tape,
there are a lot of ways

03:50.315 --> 03:52.637
That we could figure out
where they've taken him.

03:52.672 --> 03:54.960
If we can figure out
where they took him from.

03:54.995 --> 03:56.405
Well, we need to hurry.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.160
If it's the pyrates
that took him, they'll-

03:58.195 --> 03:59.365
They'll what, laila?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.700
What do they want
from him?

04:01.735 --> 04:04.000
We just need to find him.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.600
Magellan, columbus,

04:09.635 --> 04:12.085
Amerigo vespucci-

04:12.120 --> 04:15.760
Great explorers who charted
a course to a new world.

04:15.795 --> 04:20.240
And now their names
will be joined by yours.

04:20.274 --> 04:22.365
Somewhere inside your son
lies the map

04:22.400 --> 04:25.920
We must follow
to recreate the cloning process

04:25.955 --> 04:28.960
You perfected
all those years ago-

04:28.995 --> 04:30.925
The path to...

04:30.960 --> 04:34.080
Resurrecting
the son of god,

04:34.115 --> 04:37.200
The path
to our own new world.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.685
So tell me, james,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.600
Are we ready to set sail?

04:41.635 --> 04:43.245
Soon.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.040
I think if I can compare
hank's d.N.A.

04:47.075 --> 04:48.325
And physiology

04:48.360 --> 04:50.445
To a flawed subject's,

04:50.480 --> 04:53.200
Then maybe by looking
at what went wrong there,

04:53.235 --> 04:55.920
I can figure out
what went right with hank.

04:55.955 --> 04:57.245
Flawed subject?

04:57.280 --> 05:01.120
Perhaps you can offer
your services here, mr. Vincent.

05:01.155 --> 05:04.005
come on.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.280
You might even get
some answers of your own.

05:06.315 --> 05:08.685
help me, please.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.200
I'm being held here
against my will.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.080
Could... Could you call
the fbi?

05:15.115 --> 05:17.520
Ask for beck riley.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.240
What-what are you doing?

05:24.275 --> 05:27.005
I'm-I'm-I'm fine.

05:27.040 --> 05:30.000
Can you at least
tell me where I am?

05:46.970 --> 05:48.335
hank, I am so sorry.

05:48.370 --> 05:49.970
I thought if I helped them,

05:50.005 --> 05:51.535
I could keep you
out of this.

05:51.570 --> 05:53.210
Dad, you know
what these people want.

05:53.245 --> 05:54.895
You can't help them.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.670
No, but I can stall them.
Make them think that-

05:57.705 --> 05:59.757
This isn't like before, dad,
with you and mom.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.810
<i>They're not gonna let you
sneak off</i>

06:01.845 --> 06:03.450
Into the dead of the night

06:03.485 --> 06:04.975
And disappear.

06:05.010 --> 06:07.290
Once they get
what they need,

06:07.325 --> 06:09.135
They will kill us.

06:09.170 --> 06:12.170
What choice do I have?
You're my son.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.655
Oh, I see.

06:13.690 --> 06:17.090
We're taking
creative license here.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.695
Daddy's son.

06:18.730 --> 06:21.770
I prefer to call you
my creator.

06:21.805 --> 06:23.647
What is he talking about?

06:23.682 --> 06:25.455
Oh, he still doesn't know.

06:25.490 --> 06:29.510
The lab where you were born?
I was born there as well.

06:29.545 --> 06:33.530
Along with many others who,
in fact, didn't make it,

06:33.565 --> 06:35.410
Thanks to your father here.

06:36.850 --> 06:38.255
You have to understand,

06:38.290 --> 06:40.210
I thought
I could use this work

06:40.245 --> 06:42.095
To cure birth defects,
disease.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.695
That all changed
when you were born.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.650
I knew that they were gonna
cut you open,

06:46.685 --> 06:47.855
Dissect you.

06:47.890 --> 06:49.335
I couldn't let that happen.

06:49.370 --> 06:51.290
You see,
I wasn't worth keeping.

06:51.325 --> 06:53.290
You were.

06:54.490 --> 06:57.495
Maybe... Hank,

06:57.530 --> 06:59.210
If I can give them
what they want,

06:59.245 --> 07:00.707
They'll finally
leave you alone.

07:00.742 --> 07:02.170
Yeah, well,
what do they want?

07:02.205 --> 07:03.547
Just your blood.

07:03.582 --> 07:04.855
<i>Come on.</i>

07:04.890 --> 07:06.775
No more lies.
We're family.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.890
We can be honest
with each other.

07:10.690 --> 07:13.570
It is not just your blood
they want.

07:13.605 --> 07:16.290
They want the secret inside.

07:16.325 --> 07:17.655
I don't understand.

07:17.690 --> 07:21.810
They can't have a flawed savior,
now can they?

07:21.845 --> 07:24.770
He has to be perfect clone,
like you.

07:24.805 --> 07:27.250
You are the blueprint, hank.

07:27.285 --> 07:30.015
The only one...

07:30.050 --> 07:32.890
That can show them the way.

07:33.930 --> 07:37.210
Just one more time, hank.
That's it.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.335
I'll start
with hank's computer.

07:46.370 --> 07:49.070
These are the files
that hank gave me

07:49.105 --> 07:51.770
Of all
the 41 trust subsidiaries,

07:51.805 --> 07:53.050
But we didn't find anything.

07:53.085 --> 07:54.095
Yeah.

07:54.130 --> 07:56.090
Maybe hank did.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.750
You want to ask me something,
ask.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.577
So you were
put into hank's life

08:07.612 --> 08:09.451
On assignment
from the shepherds

08:09.486 --> 08:11.255
So they could, what,
watch him?

08:11.290 --> 08:13.690
Or are you still going with
the story that you stuck around

08:13.725 --> 08:16.407
Because you conveniently
fell in love with him?

08:16.442 --> 08:19.055
You think that was
convenient for me, rachel?

08:19.090 --> 08:21.850
Loving hank was the last thing
that I wanted to do.

08:21.885 --> 08:23.735
and you expect us to believe

08:23.770 --> 08:25.550
That you're not still
on assignment?

08:25.585 --> 08:27.295
Look,
you've made it pretty clear

08:27.330 --> 08:29.370
That I shouldn't expect
anything from you.

08:29.405 --> 08:31.855
But know this-

08:31.890 --> 08:33.294
The shepherds wanted
to keep hank safe

08:33.330 --> 08:35.130
And away from the people
that have him right now.

08:35.164 --> 08:37.126
So whether or not
you believe me,

08:37.162 --> 08:39.090
We all want
the same thing here.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.130
Do we?

08:42.169 --> 08:44.890
<i>everything's going
according to plan.</i>

08:44.925 --> 08:46.247
He trusts me.

08:46.282 --> 08:47.535
Very good.

08:47.570 --> 08:51.030
Know that we are grateful
for your service.

08:51.065 --> 08:54.490
We understand how trying
these missions can be.

08:54.525 --> 08:57.290
Yeah, it hasn't been
as hard as I thought.

08:57.325 --> 08:59.567
Hank makes it easy.

08:59.602 --> 09:01.775
You like this man?

09:01.810 --> 09:05.010
I-yeah, I find him
pleasant to be around.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.930
He's a good person.

09:06.965 --> 09:09.015
I see.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.810
You seem worried.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.810
I need to be sure that
you haven't been compromised.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.770
Take it.

09:17.805 --> 09:19.415
Excuse me?

09:19.450 --> 09:21.250
The gun,
I'm asking you to take it.

09:25.170 --> 09:27.770
It's heavier than you thought,
isn't it?

09:28.890 --> 09:29.975
It's a strange feeling

09:30.010 --> 09:31.930
To hold a gun
for the first time.

09:31.965 --> 09:33.415
What is this about?

09:33.450 --> 09:35.330
If the pyrates were ever
to find out

09:35.365 --> 09:36.827
About hank galliston,

09:36.862 --> 09:38.255
I need to be assured

09:38.290 --> 09:40.210
That you'll be ready to act
when called upon.

09:40.245 --> 09:42.130
I'll do whatever's asked
of me.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.087
All right.

09:44.122 --> 09:46.010
The lamb.

09:47.930 --> 09:49.775
Shoot it.
What?

09:49.810 --> 09:51.770
I'm asking you to kill
the lamb you see before you.

09:51.805 --> 09:53.015
Clearly, you doubt me.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.810
On the contrary.
I believe in your goodness.

09:54.845 --> 09:55.895
Then why would y-

09:55.930 --> 09:56.890
Your job is not
to ask questions.

09:56.925 --> 09:58.410
You took an oath.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.575
You don't have time to think.

10:02.610 --> 10:04.730
Cock the gun
and pull the trigger.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.090
good. You're ready.

10:25.650 --> 10:27.975
Nothing.

10:28.010 --> 10:31.570
come on, hank.
What were you doing?

10:44.570 --> 10:45.775
Ray.

10:45.810 --> 10:49.210
Ray, I found something.
Come here.

10:49.245 --> 10:51.130
okay, listen to this.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.330
So the chopper goes on
for about four minutes,

10:54.365 --> 10:56.010
And then...

10:59.090 --> 11:00.550
Birds.

11:00.585 --> 11:01.975
Seagulls.

11:02.010 --> 11:05.170
So wherever they took him,
they had to fly over water.

11:05.205 --> 11:07.607
And based on the velocity
of the rotor blades,

11:07.642 --> 11:10.010
I-I'm guessing 170 miles
per hour, give or take...

11:10.045 --> 11:11.490
With the duration
of the flight,

11:11.525 --> 11:13.647
That-that's what, 13 miles?

11:13.682 --> 11:15.735
Yeah, but-but from where?

11:15.770 --> 11:17.655
So I'm trying to think
like hank, right?

11:17.690 --> 11:19.415
So I'm-I'm-I'm wondering
where they took my dad,

11:19.450 --> 11:22.010
And I'm getting frustrated
because I keep coming up empty.

11:22.045 --> 11:23.547
And then I-I lean back
in the chair,

11:23.582 --> 11:25.050
Like we've seen hank do
a thousand times

11:25.085 --> 11:26.175
When he hits a wall,

11:26.210 --> 11:29.810
And-and I look up
and I see... That.

11:31.010 --> 11:33.050
The magazine cover,
it's missing.

11:33.085 --> 11:34.450
Wait.
You think he took it?

11:34.485 --> 11:35.495
Yeah, but why?

11:35.530 --> 11:37.255
And-and which one?

11:37.290 --> 11:39.330
I've looked at these,
like, a hundred times,

11:39.365 --> 11:40.807
But I can't remember.

11:40.842 --> 11:42.215
Wait. The clocks.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.455
I took photos of them
in this room.

11:43.490 --> 11:46.010
Maybe in the background
of them somehow...

11:56.530 --> 11:58.570
Wait. There. Go back. Go back.
Yeah. No, that one.

11:58.605 --> 12:00.650
Okay. Blow it up.

12:03.770 --> 12:06.410
We better call beck.

12:06.445 --> 12:08.015
plum island-

12:08.050 --> 12:10.810
The epicenter for top-secret
agricultural research,

12:10.845 --> 12:12.695
And if you're big
into conspiracies,

12:12.730 --> 12:15.210
A hotbed for
animal cloning experimentation.

12:15.245 --> 12:17.047
You ever hear of
the montauk monster?

12:17.082 --> 12:18.726
Remember that bloated,
hairless raccoon

12:18.761 --> 12:20.335
That washed up on shore
a few years back?

12:20.370 --> 12:22.570
It was not a raccoon.
It had fangs and it was-

12:22.605 --> 12:24.867
Okay, whether or not
the monster was fake,

12:24.902 --> 12:26.716
The history of plum island
is very real.

12:26.751 --> 12:28.620
There was
a secret government program

12:28.655 --> 12:30.490
That was started
right after world war ii

12:30.525 --> 12:32.347
Called operation paperclip,

12:32.382 --> 12:34.135
And the idea was to bring over

12:34.170 --> 12:36.250
The most brilliant
nazi scientists

12:36.285 --> 12:37.975
To continue their research.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.090
One of those scientists
was this guy erich traub.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.695
His specialty-viruses,

12:41.730 --> 12:44.370
Specifically...
Disease-carrying bugs.

12:44.405 --> 12:45.807
Sound familiar?

12:45.842 --> 12:47.210
Yeah, theo.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.295
They found hank's car.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.170
Uh, new london, connecticut,

12:56.205 --> 12:58.267
About a 13-mile
helicopter ride

12:58.302 --> 13:00.295
Over water from plum island.

13:00.330 --> 13:02.935
Okay, um, I need to
put together a team.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.650
We don't have time for you
to get a team together.

13:04.685 --> 13:05.935
We have to get going now.

13:05.970 --> 13:07.830
It's a secure facility.
We need backup.

13:07.865 --> 13:09.655
We gonna need-
but if we wait any longer-

13:09.690 --> 13:14.490
You are not the only worrying
about losing someone today.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.330
You're right.
Hey, hey, um...

13:18.365 --> 13:20.055
I'm sorry.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.530
Let's do it your way.

13:27.930 --> 13:32.890
Earlier you called this one
"the flawed model."

13:32.925 --> 13:36.450
I-I didn't mean it
like that.

13:36.485 --> 13:38.295
Yes, you did.

13:38.330 --> 13:42.050
I'm not interested
in your apologies.

13:42.085 --> 13:45.130
I'm interested in your answers.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.255
I want to know

13:48.290 --> 13:51.015
What went wrong with me.

13:51.050 --> 13:53.495
Every person's
genomic sequence is unique.

13:53.530 --> 13:57.690
To say "what went wrong"
is a gross simplification.

13:57.725 --> 13:59.570
You're a smart man,
dr. Galliston.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.410
Don't try my patience.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.095
Here. Your eyes.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.510
The condition is similar
to albinism.

14:09.545 --> 14:11.855
That explains
the lack of pigmentation.

14:11.890 --> 14:16.850
This is what we call
the warrior gene cluster.

14:16.885 --> 14:18.810
It controls
the aggression levels.

14:18.845 --> 14:21.015
Yours...

14:21.050 --> 14:24.135
Are over-activated.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.410
It's just genes
that have mutated.

14:26.445 --> 14:28.175
These things happen.

14:28.210 --> 14:30.530
It didn't just happen!
You did this to me!

14:30.565 --> 14:32.490
It's your mistake!

14:36.170 --> 14:37.775
But I assure you, doctor,

14:37.810 --> 14:43.450
That my warrior genes are
quite silent at the moment.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.450
We still need you.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.050
Here are our targets.

14:53.085 --> 14:54.375
White vincent...

14:54.410 --> 14:56.490
Who I'm sure
you're all familiar with,

14:56.525 --> 14:57.850
Melanie lynch...

14:58.970 --> 15:00.770
C.E.O. Of the 41 trust...

15:02.330 --> 15:03.770
And theo riley.

15:06.610 --> 15:09.530
You have orders to apprehend
these subjects

15:09.565 --> 15:11.987
By whatever means necessary.

15:12.022 --> 15:13.896
What are you guys
doing here?

15:13.931 --> 15:15.735
We got a message
from laila.

15:15.770 --> 15:17.935
Said you wanted us
all to meet here.

15:17.970 --> 15:20.090
I-I never spoke with laila.
Is she here with you?

15:20.125 --> 15:21.930
No. Wait. You don't think
she's headed-

15:21.965 --> 15:24.655
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.130
Why would she try
to save hank without us?

15:27.165 --> 15:29.090
Maybe she's not trying
to save him.

15:29.125 --> 15:32.295
<i>one more target...</i>

15:32.330 --> 15:34.735
<i>Laila galliston.</i>

15:34.770 --> 15:36.215
<i>At this point, her motives</i>

15:36.250 --> 15:37.810
<i>And level of involvement
are unclear.</i>

15:37.845 --> 15:39.215
Thanks.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.210
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

15:46.170 --> 15:48.170
How can I help you?

15:48.205 --> 15:50.135
How much for this one?

15:50.170 --> 15:53.530
Ah, with the motor?
$1,500.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.410
All right.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.400
so is this
our answer?

16:00.435 --> 16:02.305
Yes. Erythropoietin...

16:02.340 --> 16:04.140
a rare variation
that caused hank's body

16:04.175 --> 16:05.940
To produce
extra red blood cells.

16:05.975 --> 16:07.505
Which would help fight off

16:07.540 --> 16:09.020
Any mutating genetic sequences
in his body.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.460
we must have
triggered it somewhere

16:10.495 --> 16:11.540
During the cloning process.

16:11.575 --> 16:13.037
A lucky accident.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.465
This was no accident.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.100
This was
god's divine intervention.

16:17.135 --> 16:18.665
The god of the 21st century...

16:18.700 --> 16:21.900
No longer speaks
in tongues and riddles.

16:21.935 --> 16:23.145
He speaks through science.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.740
But how can we be sure
the doctor's not lying?

16:25.775 --> 16:26.860
It's a legitimate hypothesis.

16:26.895 --> 16:27.997
Is it?

16:28.032 --> 16:29.065
Yeah.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.545
Uh, the only way
to know for sure

16:30.580 --> 16:32.140
Is to sample tissue from
one of hank's major organs-

16:32.175 --> 16:34.025
Liver, uh, kidneys.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.660
We're not equipped for
that kind of invasive surgery.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.105
The slightest misstep-

16:38.140 --> 16:40.625
Who won't have the same
fatherly investment,

16:40.660 --> 16:45.220
Someone who may not care
whether his son lives or not.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.900
The choice is up to you.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.020
Suction.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.420
No.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.585
Doctor?

17:15.619 --> 17:21.099
Yes. I no longer like
the terms of my employment.

17:21.135 --> 17:23.460
I didn't realize
the only person

17:23.494 --> 17:25.740
With nothing to negotiate

17:25.775 --> 17:26.825
Had the choice-

17:26.859 --> 17:28.620
You need hank's tissue sample.

17:28.655 --> 17:30.665
I know where to find it.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.900
But if I don't finish
this procedure in five minutes,

17:33.935 --> 17:34.945
Hank dies,

17:34.980 --> 17:37.100
And nobody gets
what they want.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.865
It's a good game.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.540
But trust me, you don't have
the stomach for it.

17:44.575 --> 17:46.980
Or should I say
the right gene for it?

17:47.015 --> 17:49.145
You think I'm bluffing?

17:49.180 --> 17:51.380
I'd rather have my son
die here with no pain

17:51.415 --> 17:53.465
Than be killed at your hand.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.140
I know you people.
I know what you have planned.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.865
Then why fight it?

17:57.900 --> 18:00.060
Because I believe my son
still has a life to live...

18:00.095 --> 18:01.665
A good one.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.780
And I intend
to make that happen.

18:03.815 --> 18:05.540
Doctor,
pressure is falling.

18:05.575 --> 18:06.860
we should push fluids.

18:07.980 --> 18:10.860
put more in the drip.

18:13.340 --> 18:17.945
So what are the terms
for this renegotiation?

18:17.980 --> 18:21.860
You make sure hank and I
get off this island safely,

18:21.895 --> 18:23.937
And in return, I give you

18:23.972 --> 18:25.980
What you've always wanted.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.460
Does she have a message
for me?

18:49.300 --> 18:50.780
Mm.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.145
I used to paint.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.740
Little hard to do
around here so...

18:57.775 --> 18:59.705
I draw.

18:59.740 --> 19:02.145
Helps me see things,

19:02.180 --> 19:04.780
Things I don't want
to forget.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.540
Well, it helps.

19:09.820 --> 19:12.740
How about you,
you ever draw?

19:16.260 --> 19:17.580
Come here.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.385
All right.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.140
You can start...

19:25.175 --> 19:26.860
With anything-

19:26.895 --> 19:28.797
A line,

19:28.832 --> 19:30.665
A shape.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.800
Just close your eyes...

19:33.835 --> 19:36.900
And draw what you see...

19:39.940 --> 19:43.020
What no one understands
but you.

19:43.055 --> 19:44.140
theo riley.

19:44.175 --> 19:46.025
Yes.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.300
Dr. Galliston told me
to give you this sample.

19:48.335 --> 19:50.345
He said it's ready
to be analyzed.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.220
Uh, great. You can just
set it over there.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.400
Thank you.

19:57.435 --> 19:59.140
No problem.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.500
That's it.

20:08.620 --> 20:11.425
Keep going.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.425
I spent my life
with theo.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.220
I thought I knew him,
and then...

20:16.255 --> 20:17.980
You know, laila was
the first person

20:18.015 --> 20:19.465
I let myself trust.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.220
Now she's probably about
the last person I ever would.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.957
But do you think that
she could hurt hank?

20:24.992 --> 20:27.660
Do you think that
you could hurt theo?

20:53.780 --> 20:55.240
La-laila?

20:55.275 --> 20:56.665
no, hank.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.745
It's not laila.

20:58.780 --> 21:00.540
How are you feeling?

21:00.575 --> 21:02.977
Why are you here?

21:03.012 --> 21:05.345
I came to thank you.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.425
After all,
it's your precious gift

21:07.460 --> 21:09.820
That's going to make
everything possible.

21:10.940 --> 21:14.140
You need to take it easy.

21:14.175 --> 21:15.865
Why is that...

21:15.900 --> 21:18.025
The end of the world?

21:18.060 --> 21:20.380
I understand
the path to the truth

21:20.415 --> 21:22.705
Is not an easy one.

21:22.740 --> 21:28.100
In fact,
it took me some convincing.

21:28.135 --> 21:30.060
My father was a doctor,

21:30.095 --> 21:31.625
Much like yours.

21:31.660 --> 21:34.505
I grew up in labs
and hospitals,

21:34.540 --> 21:39.340
Believing sickness and death
was always around me.

21:39.375 --> 21:42.037
Then I learned
what he was really doing.

21:42.072 --> 21:44.700
That in all those hours
searching, testing,

21:44.735 --> 21:47.620
What he was really trying
to do was...

21:47.655 --> 21:50.660
Deliver us the ultimate cure.

21:50.695 --> 21:53.017
And what's that?

21:53.052 --> 21:55.305
A clean slate.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.820
Is that what you're calling
your apocalypse?

21:58.855 --> 22:00.945
What else would you call it?

22:00.980 --> 22:03.980
Open your eyes,
look at the world around you,

22:04.015 --> 22:06.980
All the ways we've found
to destroy one another

22:07.015 --> 22:08.837
Over and over,

22:08.872 --> 22:10.625
Then tell me...

22:10.660 --> 22:13.820
Do you really believe
this world is worth saving?

22:13.855 --> 22:16.740
Does it matter
wh-what I believe?

22:16.775 --> 22:19.625
I mean, come on.

22:19.660 --> 22:22.020
There have always been
people like you

22:22.055 --> 22:23.865
Throughout history,

22:23.900 --> 22:26.185
Trying to scare everyone...

22:26.220 --> 22:29.660
With your talks
of fire and brimstone.

22:29.695 --> 22:32.060
But guess how this story ends.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.300
Enlighten me.

22:35.335 --> 22:36.745
Sooner or later,

22:36.780 --> 22:39.780
People will realize
that you're just a-

22:39.815 --> 22:42.857
Another crazy nut case,

22:42.892 --> 22:45.900
And they'll stop listening.

22:45.935 --> 22:48.617
And you'll disappear.

22:48.652 --> 22:51.300
And no one remembers you.

22:51.335 --> 22:53.665
Is that so?

22:53.700 --> 22:56.980
And it's not just
the people who see it.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.265
He'll see it, too...

23:00.300 --> 23:05.425
The pain that you've caused
in his name.

23:05.460 --> 23:09.140
God understands that I did
what had to be done.

23:09.175 --> 23:10.345
You sure about that?

23:10.380 --> 23:13.060
You're playing god,
melanie.

23:13.095 --> 23:15.105
And I'm thinking...

23:15.140 --> 23:17.480
He might not be too happy

23:17.515 --> 23:19.747
About handing the keys over

23:19.782 --> 23:22.261
To a false prophet like you.

23:22.296 --> 23:24.938
I will not be trifled with!

23:24.973 --> 23:27.336
I will deliver on my promise.

23:27.371 --> 23:29.665
I will lift this darkness

23:29.700 --> 23:34.420
And I will deliver the world
the burning it deserves.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.065
Like I said earlier...

23:41.100 --> 23:43.105
You must take care
of yourself.

23:43.140 --> 23:46.860
We're all very grateful
for what you've done.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.740
come on.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.980
come on.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.820
You really think
you can fix me?

24:16.780 --> 24:19.620
How can I be sure
you're not lying?

24:19.655 --> 24:21.225
You can't.

24:21.260 --> 24:24.300
Gene therapy is still
a highly experimental procedure.

24:24.335 --> 24:26.145
Oh, reassuring.

24:26.180 --> 24:29.580
The recombinant stem cells,

24:29.615 --> 24:31.117
If successful,

24:31.152 --> 24:32.585
Will regenerate

24:32.620 --> 24:34.820
The healthy tissues
in your eyes.

24:37.540 --> 24:40.460
I should warn you,
this may be uncomfortable.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.625
Like this will be

24:43.660 --> 24:46.020
If you try anything clever.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.980
Ah.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.380
your eyes will
be sensitive for a while.

26:15.415 --> 26:17.180
Sunglasses will help.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.840
Vision is a little bit off.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.140
That should clear up soon.

26:25.175 --> 26:27.665
It didn't work.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.900
Let's have a closer look.

26:37.340 --> 26:39.740
<i>The pigments are regenerating.</i>

26:39.775 --> 26:42.180
Is it permanent?

26:44.860 --> 26:48.060
It should be.

26:49.660 --> 26:52.740
If you don't mind,
I'd like to see if my-

26:52.775 --> 26:55.660
If hank is okay.

26:55.695 --> 26:58.265
Yeah.

26:58.300 --> 27:02.500
There's a guard outside
that will escort you.

27:04.660 --> 27:08.380
And then you'll come
and collect us and-

27:08.415 --> 27:10.860
Yes.
My end of the bargain.

27:12.220 --> 27:15.060
I'll make sure
you and your son

27:15.095 --> 27:16.900
Come out here alive.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.585
I know...

27:24.620 --> 27:27.100
You're not interested
in apologies.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.140
If I could go back

27:30.175 --> 27:31.905
And do it over,

27:31.940 --> 27:33.820
I would take you with me.

27:54.300 --> 27:55.580
We got visitors.

27:58.460 --> 27:59.865
I want a complete evacuation.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.480
Have vincent stay
with our subject.

28:01.515 --> 28:03.507
We can't leave
until we're sure

28:03.542 --> 28:05.500
We have what we need
from him.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.745
Put your drawing away.

28:08.780 --> 28:11.300
Our time here
is coming to a close.

28:17.300 --> 28:20.105
destroy it. All of it.

28:20.140 --> 28:21.420
all right.
We're shutting down.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.760
Find hank galliston,

28:52.795 --> 28:54.665
But don't shoot him.

28:54.700 --> 28:57.700
He's too valuable for that.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.100
laila.

29:14.135 --> 29:15.417
hank.

29:15.452 --> 29:16.665
Hey.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.825
How did you get in here?

29:18.860 --> 29:21.500
there's no time.
We need to go.

29:21.535 --> 29:22.585
White vincent's here.

29:22.620 --> 29:25.220
It's okay.
I know how to get out of here.

29:25.255 --> 29:27.660
Trust me.

29:34.780 --> 29:37.505
You guys wait here.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.860
I'll let you know
when I find him.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.420
vincent.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.820
Laila.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.625
Fbi.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.660
We're here to inspect
the premises.

30:19.695 --> 30:21.505
Sorry, private property,

30:21.540 --> 30:23.105
Unless you've got
a warrant.

30:23.140 --> 30:25.580
We have probable cause
and a whole lot of guns.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.340
I'm gonna suggest
that's warrant enough

30:27.375 --> 30:28.745
For you to step aside.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.220
Afraid I can't do that,
ma'am.

30:50.380 --> 30:51.865
Where are we?

30:51.900 --> 30:55.265
Still sequencing the protein
receptor expressions.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.060
Our enemies are at the gate.
We can't stay much longer.

30:58.095 --> 30:59.580
I just got the samples
from galliston an hour ago.

30:59.615 --> 31:00.825
It takes time.

31:00.860 --> 31:03.340
The good doctor,
where is he?

31:03.375 --> 31:04.780
Drop it. Drop the weapon.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.100
Where's hank?

31:08.135 --> 31:09.537
I don't know.

31:09.572 --> 31:10.905
White vincent,

31:10.940 --> 31:12.345
Theo riley-
you seen any of them?

31:12.380 --> 31:13.820
Check the lab.
But don't worry about vincent.

31:13.855 --> 31:14.865
We have an arrangement.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.720
He's gonna help hank
get out of here.

31:16.755 --> 31:18.540
Yeah, I doubt that.
Help him out.

31:18.575 --> 31:19.997
This way, sir.

31:20.032 --> 31:21.385
Wait a minute.

31:21.420 --> 31:24.300
Where's laila?
Have you seen her anywhere?

31:24.335 --> 31:25.900
What would laila
be doing here?

31:28.460 --> 31:31.180
Come on. You two with me.

31:34.620 --> 31:36.060
it's okay.

31:48.580 --> 31:51.065
Hey, hank, open up.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.860
I will not hurt you.
I need you, brother.

31:52.895 --> 31:54.980
hank!

31:56.620 --> 31:58.980
There's gotta be
another way out.

32:04.500 --> 32:08.100
I've got nothing.
No doors, no windows. You?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.020
nothing.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.940
Come on.

32:13.820 --> 32:15.460
What is that?

32:15.495 --> 32:16.745
what?

32:16.780 --> 32:17.900
open up, hank!

32:19.020 --> 32:20.300
oh, my god.
Open! Hank!

32:20.335 --> 32:22.025
Oh, my god.

32:22.060 --> 32:23.980
What is this place?

32:25.100 --> 32:27.020
Hank, what did they do
to you?

32:27.055 --> 32:29.220
I need you, brother.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.060
Dad...

32:33.460 --> 32:34.985
He did a little surgery.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.500
He said they needed
to find something.

32:36.535 --> 32:39.020
Did he find
what they needed?

32:39.055 --> 32:40.425
I don't know.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.020
Hank, think. Try and remember.
It's really important.

32:42.055 --> 32:43.225
If they wanted something
from you,

32:43.260 --> 32:44.980
I need to know if they got it.
I was out, laila.

32:45.015 --> 32:47.257
I-I didn't hang out
for the results.

32:47.292 --> 32:49.500
I mean,
what does it matter if...

32:51.980 --> 32:54.340
It's really important.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.705
Ohh.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.340
Of course.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.980
You didn't come here
to save me, did you, laila?

33:04.860 --> 33:07.180
You came here...
To save everyone.

33:07.215 --> 33:09.505
I don't know what to do.

33:09.540 --> 33:12.420
You can choose to believe
there's another way.

33:12.455 --> 33:14.940
You can choose
to believe they're lying.

33:14.975 --> 33:17.740
You can choose to believe
in more

33:17.775 --> 33:18.860
Than a book.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.060
I'm sorry.

33:25.260 --> 33:28.740
We've run out of time.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.300
Laila, put the gun down.

33:35.335 --> 33:37.145
the locusts-it's a sign.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.705
He's telling me
I have no choice.

33:38.740 --> 33:40.980
Or maybe he's presenting you
with one.

33:41.015 --> 33:43.020
Isn't that what god does?

33:43.055 --> 33:44.985
He tests us, right?

33:45.020 --> 33:47.780
I tried to stop it, hank.
I did.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.660
I didn't want to love you.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.665
Laila...

33:53.700 --> 33:55.200
Whatever's out there,

33:55.235 --> 33:56.700
What-whatever happens...

33:57.900 --> 34:00.620
We can
get through it together.

34:00.655 --> 34:02.657
Oh, hank.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.660
I promise.

34:06.580 --> 34:10.025
<i>Serve god... Not man.</i>

34:10.060 --> 34:11.665
<i>You don't have time to think.</i>

34:11.699 --> 34:13.780
<i>Cock the gun
and pull the trigger.</i>

34:17.460 --> 34:19.060
Hank.

34:19.094 --> 34:20.659
No!

34:31.380 --> 34:32.820
It's done.

34:32.855 --> 34:34.516
It's finished.

34:34.552 --> 34:36.145
It worked.

34:36.179 --> 34:37.780
We have the code.

34:37.815 --> 34:40.197
His code.

34:40.232 --> 34:42.025
At last...

34:42.061 --> 34:43.820
We're ready.

34:45.739 --> 34:46.860
Oh.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.179
It's okay.

34:50.215 --> 34:52.145
vincent.

34:52.179 --> 34:57.380
Okay. Looks like they have what
they need from you, brother.

34:57.415 --> 34:59.220
And so do I.

35:02.580 --> 35:04.180
you think it's the fbi?

35:04.215 --> 35:06.100
I don't think so.

35:09.220 --> 35:12.180
Where are you-
ray, where are you going?

35:19.060 --> 35:20.820
I see lynch,

35:20.855 --> 35:22.865
Theo.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.820
Call beck.

35:24.855 --> 35:26.757
Lab's clear.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.625
Nothing here.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.060
Thought you might
like to take a look.

35:43.020 --> 35:45.460
I got this.

35:47.820 --> 35:49.545
yeah.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.660
beck, where are you?
They're getting away.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.460
Come here, pretty one.

36:01.495 --> 36:02.705
Rachel. Rachel.

36:02.740 --> 36:04.180
Hey, hey, hey, hey, back off

36:04.215 --> 36:05.585
Or you spend the next week

36:05.620 --> 36:07.900
Picking bits of her face
out of your hair.

36:11.780 --> 36:14.180
Don't shoot!
He's got a hostage.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.380
I'm sorry.

36:44.580 --> 36:48.660
I tried to stop it
on the bridge.

36:48.695 --> 36:51.420
I tried to tell you.

36:51.455 --> 36:52.905
What?

36:52.940 --> 36:55.820
No, it's just I found this
in my pocket.

36:58.780 --> 37:01.420
Wow.
You're doing this.

37:01.455 --> 37:04.025
You're really doing this.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.020
This is the part
where you say "yes,"

37:06.055 --> 37:08.020
And then we kiss.

37:09.740 --> 37:12.060
I can't.

37:12.095 --> 37:14.345
I can't.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.020
Whoa, whoa, wait.
What do you-laila.

37:16.055 --> 37:18.197
Hank,
please don't follow me.

37:18.232 --> 37:19.846
No. No, no, no, no.
Just stop.

37:19.881 --> 37:21.460
Stop, stop, please, just...

37:21.495 --> 37:24.305
Look, okay...

37:24.340 --> 37:28.465
You're scared, right?

37:28.500 --> 37:31.140
Commitment, getting old...

37:31.175 --> 37:33.437
It's not that. I just...

37:33.472 --> 37:35.700
I don't want to hurt you.

37:37.100 --> 37:39.340
Uh, how do you know
I won't hurt you?

37:42.060 --> 37:45.020
Listen, listen,
all I know

37:45.055 --> 37:48.585
Is you and me...

37:48.620 --> 37:51.860
We can't live
without each other.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.065
But if I'm wrong,

37:54.100 --> 37:57.905
I-I-if everything
that's happened

37:57.940 --> 38:00.780
In the last few months
is just my imagination,

38:00.815 --> 38:03.505
Tell me, okay?

38:03.540 --> 38:06.220
Tell me you don't love me,

38:06.255 --> 38:09.700
And I'll go.

38:09.735 --> 38:11.380
Hank...

38:15.220 --> 38:17.120
I love you.

38:17.155 --> 38:18.985
It's not that.

38:19.020 --> 38:21.340
Then let's not
make this hard.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.337
Look, just...

38:23.372 --> 38:25.300
Just say "yes."

38:29.980 --> 38:31.780
Yes.

38:38.700 --> 38:41.140
I love you.
