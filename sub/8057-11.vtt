WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:03.613
Well, it's a pleasure
to be here, ladies.

00:03.870 --> 00:05.543
I didn't think
anybody really cared

00:05.605 --> 00:07.209
about my time
on the city council.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.014
Oh, we do. I mean, you
are such an inspiration.

00:10.076 --> 00:11.953
Still going strong at 82.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.184
(SNEEZES)

00:13.279 --> 00:14.451
(BLOWS NOSE)

00:14.714 --> 00:15.886
How old is
that handkerchief?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.924
Well, it's not a handkerchief.
It's a receipt.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.461
(GROANS)

00:19.519 --> 00:23.490
Paula Horke was Pawnee's first
female city councilor 40 years ago.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.160
And she was a huge
inspiration to me.

00:25.325 --> 00:27.271
Women have come
a long way in Pawnee,

00:27.327 --> 00:29.068
but we still have
quite a ways to go.

00:29.295 --> 00:30.433
I mean, technically,

00:30.497 --> 00:32.704
I'm not allowed to reserve
this conference room

00:32.799 --> 00:34.904
without my husband
or father's signature.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.205
Government was a real boys
club back in the '70s.

00:38.338 --> 00:41.148
They smoked their cigars.
They snapped my bra.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.981
Wore mirrors on their shoes
to look up my skirt.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.981
Well, I am happy to report that it
is now a pervert-free people's club.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.991
Well, except for
Councilman Dexhart,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.654
who is
a self-described pervert.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.829
Yeah, and didn't Milton
try to kiss you?

00:54.154 --> 00:55.690
Well, yeah.
Things aren't perfect.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.063
PAULA:
All the other councilmen

00:57.290 --> 01:00.032
used to keep a calendar
of my menstrual cycle.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.632
Are you kidding me?

01:01.694 --> 01:04.300
That is horrible.
They don't do that to me.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.169
Do they do that to me?

01:06.232 --> 01:07.939
I once tried to
start a commission

01:08.101 --> 01:10.843
to try to get more jobs for
women in city government.

01:11.037 --> 01:12.072
And they dismissed me,

01:12.172 --> 01:14.448
saying that it was because it
was just my time of the month.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.646
Admittedly,
they were right.

01:17.444 --> 01:18.650
Because of their calendar.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.289
LESLIE: Man-pigs.
All of them.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.458
You know what? I'm going to
get that commission going.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.688
Because this inequality
has gone on long enough.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.894
You know what? I think men
are better than women.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.089
She's kidding.
APRIL: No, I'm not.

01:29.489 --> 01:33.096
They provide for us, and we must obey
them because they are our masters.

01:33.359 --> 01:34.565
April, stop it.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.239
Leslie, you'll never land a beau
with that domineering tone.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.075
APRIL: We must always
walk behind the men.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.237
She...

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.588 --> 02:03.795
Mustache, dumb, dumb.
Mustache, dumb, dumb.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.866
Mustache, dumb, dumb.
RON: Hello.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.231
I just came to drop off
some of the employee...

02:08.862 --> 02:10.033
What is happening?

02:10.096 --> 02:11.166
Dumb!

02:11.231 --> 02:12.266
RON: <i>The girls are
on break.</i>

02:12.499 --> 02:14.979
And their sitter had to go
out of town for the day.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.945
<i>So, I'm watching them
while Diane works.</i>

02:17.403 --> 02:21.351
I borrowed some markers from Leslie,
and some stickers from Leslie.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.715
And a LITE-BRITE,
which I got from Andy.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.618
Girls, this is Ann.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.416
Talk to Ann.
She's terrific.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.120
Hey, dudettes.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.395
You stoked about
the weekend? No?

02:34.687 --> 02:35.927
Oh.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.868
(IN CHILDLIKE TONE) Look at this.
Pretty, pretty, little bead.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.233
They're not infants.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.397
I don't know.
I'm weird with kids.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.105
So... You guys
like Coldplay?

02:46.799 --> 02:48.039
You're weird.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.009
You're...

02:51.538 --> 02:53.142
Well, hey, girls.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.220
No.
Okay. Thanks.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.716
An equal gender
employment commission.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.587
Leslie, I don't think
this is a good idea.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.889
I think
it's a fantastic idea.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.188
Oh. I didn't know where you
were going with that.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.700
The lack of women in this
government is criminal.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.603
I'm going to ask
each department

03:12.659 --> 03:14.070
to send two people
to a meeting today.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.032
Yeah.
And.

03:16.095 --> 03:17.267
And, and...

03:17.730 --> 03:20.506
I can ask Shauna Malwae-Tweep
to write an article about it

03:20.600 --> 03:23.171
for the Pawnee Journal.
She's my special friend.

03:23.570 --> 03:24.708
That's what
you're calling her now.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.409
I don't know
what to call her.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.112
I don't entirely understand
the behavior of young people.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.580
Recently, we engaged in
something called a group hang.

03:32.645 --> 03:34.716
It was like a date, but there
were seven other people there.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.326
It was very confusing.

03:36.749 --> 03:39.093
I'm not really sure
what our label is.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.189
Labels can be bad.
But they can also be good.

03:41.287 --> 03:43.699
"Warning: toxic bleach"
is a good label.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.164
Shauna Malwae-Tweep
has amazing dimples.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.735
So, the commission? Oh! Yes.
Right. The commission.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.332
I'm going to get that
going right now. Great.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.835
Okay. I know this text
you sent me was a lie

03:55.902 --> 03:58.712
and Michael Stipe is not actually here.
Correct?

03:58.771 --> 04:00.409
Correct.
That was a lie.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.918
Yeah. No, I knew it was.
I just...

04:03.009 --> 04:04.920
...couldn't live with
myself if it had been true.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.145
And that's why I sent it.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.213
Where's free Skittles?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.520
Here you go, buddy.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.956
Ah! He gets his thing?

04:18.291 --> 04:19.928
Listen, I need you
two to teach me

04:20.026 --> 04:22.267
everything you know
about basketball.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.908
<i>TOM: Rent A Swag is
doing really well.</i>

04:24.964 --> 04:27.604
<i>I'm on track to turn a
profit in my third month.</i>

04:27.867 --> 04:31.713
One problem. All the kids that shop
in the store are basketball crazy.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.317
It's all they talk about. I need
to be able to <i>schmooze</i> them.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.145
And I can't keep referring
to basketball players

04:36.209 --> 04:38.849
as Khloe Kardashian's husband
and his friends.

04:38.911 --> 04:40.652
You're just the men
to help me out.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.054
One jock.
One geek who loves stats.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.623
I'll give you
a few minutes to cancel

04:44.684 --> 04:45.890
the rest of your plans
for the day.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.191
No need. My only plan
was to buy Skittles.

04:49.889 --> 04:54.531
Wow, Chris, your gender equality
commission is a real sausage fest.

04:55.662 --> 04:56.902
Oh, my God.
You're kidding me.

04:56.996 --> 05:00.102
I just assumed that some of the
departments would send women.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.043
Oh, my God.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.005
I am part
of the problem.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.572
EXCUSE me, everyone.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.447
Did anyone notice
that there are no women

05:07.507 --> 05:09.248
on the gender
equality commission?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.186
There's a lady
right next to you.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.087
Oh, wait, no.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.089
It's just
a very beautiful man.

05:15.214 --> 05:18.058
Yes. Okay. We are going to need
to rebalance this commission.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.661
Listen.
You did a great job

05:19.719 --> 05:22.029
setting it up and
getting the snacks ready.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.566
But we'll take it
from here.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.693
Well, Councilman Milton,

05:24.857 --> 05:25.858
I did put
the snacks together.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.131
And they are delicious,
I must say.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.297
But that is
not the point.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.773
Round of applause for the girl.
(ALL APPLAUDING)

05:30.830 --> 05:33.106
But she has to leave
to get more snacks.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.509
No, I don't.
This is my commission.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.147
Ouch. Why so ornery?

05:38.104 --> 05:39.412
It's not the 7th yet.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.021
Hmm.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.580
Your shoes
are red now.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.315
<i>Y ay.
Hurray',!</i>

05:49.015 --> 05:50.494
(GIRLS GIGGLING)
Hey.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.120
Mommy!
Mommy!

05:52.185 --> 05:53.459
You survived, huh?

05:53.586 --> 05:54.860
Indeed, I did.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.696
How were they? Really.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.237
Couldn't have been better.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.561
We had a wonderful time.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.628
Well, that's good.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.099
Because my sitter
is still out of town.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.143
So, I really hate
to ask you this,

06:08.301 --> 06:10.907
but is there any way that you
could take them again tomorrow?

06:11.337 --> 06:12.816
Of course.
I'd be delighted.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.445
You're a lifesaver.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.578
Thank you. Girls, you want to
spend another day with Ron?

06:16.709 --> 06:17.847
Yeah!
Yeah!

06:25.818 --> 06:29.561
I believe one problem
with hiring women

06:29.622 --> 06:32.068
is that they are
frail and breakable.

06:32.291 --> 06:33.702
Is it possible
you are thinking

06:33.760 --> 06:35.797
about light bulbs?
Or your hip?

06:36.429 --> 06:38.841
If I were 300 years older,
Councilman...

06:38.898 --> 06:41.970
Incoherent ramblings aside,
I have done some research,

06:42.034 --> 06:45.208
and the female employment rate
in government is abysmal.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.849
The number one offender?
Sanitation.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.448
All right.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.284
No, no, no.
Stop celebrating.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.020
Why are there no female
garbage collectors, Steve?

06:54.213 --> 06:56.124
I don't know. We hire
women for other things.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.162
You have one woman,
and she's a secretary.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.297
And she's the best
secretary we got.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.929
Except for Dan.
Dan's awesome.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.262
Dan.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.903
Garbage collectors make good wages.
They have good benefits.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.297
They are the smelly glue that
keeps this city together.

07:09.395 --> 07:10.635
You need to
hire more women.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.104
Not that many
women apply.

07:12.331 --> 07:15.471
Plus, it's a very
physically demanding job.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.946
Your average woman
can't handle it.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.741
Oh, no?

07:21.174 --> 07:24.678
Okay, so I took extensive notes on
ways to maximize our efficiency.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.121
Because we can't be just as good as the men.
We have to be better.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.850
Yeah, you're totally right.
Let's rock this.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.855
April, I love you, but I don't
need your sarcasm right now.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.588
I'm serious.
Let's get rolling.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.189
I want to get
into some garbage.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.334
What? I love garbage.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.532
Have you ever found a
dead body in the trash?

07:40.626 --> 07:41.730
Or body parts?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.433
Like a torso or a head?

07:43.529 --> 07:44.803
Please say head.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.969
Hey, Dewey.
Leslie brought binders.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.068
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:48.134 --> 07:51.138
What do they say? "Pick up
garbage, put in truck"?

07:51.671 --> 07:54.413
Actually, yeah. That's what's in the binder.
On every page.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.851
Because I believe
in being thorough.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.549
All right.
Okay.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.122
Let's do it,
trash people!

07:59.178 --> 08:00.350
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:00.413 --> 08:01.983
Let's feed the beast!

08:06.486 --> 08:09.763
Here you are. I had to search the
directory for quite a while.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.669
I thought your last name was
Hanson for some reason.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.997
No. It's Perkins.
Always has been.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.175
You seem
more like a Hanson.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.836
Anyway, I have
the girls again today,

08:20.900 --> 08:22.106
and they're asking
to play with you.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.114
Really?
I thought they hated me.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.308
The opposite.

08:25.371 --> 08:26.850
I don't know
what you did to them,

08:26.906 --> 08:28.351
but it worked
like gangbusters.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.278
Or they do hate me, and
you're just desperate and tired.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.753
Either way.
Can you help me?

08:34.080 --> 08:37.027
I'm out of activities and they're
playing with my land mine.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.255
(CHUCKLING)

08:38.317 --> 08:40.729
This thing's cool.
What are these things?

08:42.455 --> 08:45.095
Let's play a word
association game.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.598
I'll say a word
and then you say

08:46.659 --> 08:48.138
the first thing that
pops into your mind.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.229
Okay.

08:49.295 --> 08:50.330
You.

08:50.396 --> 08:51.397
Reporter.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.408
Me.
City manager.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.072
Us.
Ooh! Magazine.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.113
CHRIS: According to
Leslie's binder,

09:01.173 --> 09:02.652
she and April are
making even better time

09:02.708 --> 09:04.119
than the guys do
on a normal day.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.153
That's weird. You know, with
us being women and all.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.289
You'd think our boobs
would get in the way.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.025
SHAUNA: Is that accurate,
Mr. Phlegner?

09:11.183 --> 09:13.424
Is Councilwoman Knope ahead of the
regular schedule for this route?

09:13.586 --> 09:15.190
Whatever.
No comment.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.559
Tough stuff.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.398
Are you posing? I don't have
a photographer with me.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.202
Google Earth.
Always taking pics.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.872
Let's move it out.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.741
BEN: All right, let's
start with the basics.

09:25.831 --> 09:28.277
Why don't you just play some
one-on-one, see if you can score.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.369
Andy, guard him.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.816
He's too big.
I can't see over him.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.715
It's not fair. I feel like
everyone should be the same size.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.309
Okay. You have
to create space.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.581
You've got to just
dribble around him.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.585
There you go.
Now what?

09:39.779 --> 09:41.156
Shoot. Shoot the ball.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.154
Did I do basketball?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.522
Kind of.

09:44.850 --> 09:45.988
Try it again.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.869
Tommy for the dunk!

09:58.864 --> 09:59.865
(GRUNTS)

09:59.932 --> 10:01.138
(SCREAMS)

10:03.002 --> 10:04.413
My screen!

10:05.504 --> 10:08.610
But it was actually
a blood-hungry witch

10:08.674 --> 10:11.177
who was wearing their
mom's face like a mask.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.654
(BOTH SCREAMING)

10:12.745 --> 10:13.746
(LAUGHS)

10:13.846 --> 10:15.291
What is wrong
with you, woman?

10:15.348 --> 10:18.056
I'm sorry. I thought
kids liked ghost stories.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.221
Hey, girls. Do you want to
look through my nurse kit?

10:20.353 --> 10:21.525
Yeah!
Yeah!

10:21.587 --> 10:23.157
Ooh, check it out.
Bandages.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.930
We can wrap up the dolls and
pretend they just had surgery!

10:25.992 --> 10:27.300
Yeah.
Awesome.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.397
Yeah? Or we can use this
hammer and test reflexes.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.907
Yeah.
Here, Zoe. Watch.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.667
Do me! Do me!

10:33.499 --> 10:34.534
Do Princess Junebug now.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.601
Okay.

10:35.668 --> 10:38.615
You know what, Ron? I can watch them
for a little while if you want to...

10:39.105 --> 10:40.550
...take a break.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.352
This is
Stacy Knoblauch's house.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.652
I went to high school
with her,

10:47.713 --> 10:49.090
and she was
super mean to me.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.922
And now, I know
that she dyes her hair.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.398
I knew that wench
wasn't naturally blonde.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.533
Oh, my God.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.797
She has to use
prescription-strength deodorant.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.036
This is the best day
of my life.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.235
Hey, ladies, someone
just called in a pick-up.

11:06.298 --> 11:07.868
We have to make
an unscheduled stop.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.941
Hope you can handle it.
It's not in the binders.

11:10.036 --> 11:13.381
A new challenge? Bring
it on, Stevie boy. Whoo!

11:13.439 --> 11:16.886
April, let's finish up. We have
some stereotypes to overcome.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.781
And some privacy
to violate.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.016
Yeah!
Whoo!

11:20.079 --> 11:21.752
(BANGING)
Wait. No.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.519
Oh!
Yes!

11:26.018 --> 11:27.895
Nothing but net.
ANDY: Nice.

11:27.953 --> 11:29.728
You are
officially a baller.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.130
I've been a baller since birth, son.
Now, I'm an athlete.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.196
Hey. You little chumps
want to play some ball?

11:35.261 --> 11:37.138
Sure.
Let's do this.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.340
Watch out.
Tommy from half court.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.542
This could
really only go poorly.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.957
He won't get out
of my way!

12:00.686 --> 12:01.926
Oh, my God.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.467
Nice!
Yes.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.538
Tom, what the hell
are you doing?

12:14.667 --> 12:15.873
I'm pivoting.
Ben told me to pivot.

12:16.035 --> 12:19.141
I told you you can pivot,
not that you can only pivot.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.679
BEN: Stop pivoting.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.510
All right,
that's illegal.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.145
I may not know much,
but you can't

12:24.210 --> 12:25.746
just steal the ball
from another player.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.381
Hey. Aren't you the guy
who owns Rent A Swag?

12:27.446 --> 12:28.857
Yeah. Tom Haverford.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.257
You suck
at basketball, man.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.657
Well, you suck at
being polite, sir.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.028
This has been fun, but we
have an actual game tomorrow.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.794
Against guys who
can actually play.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.224
Let's go.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.295
Andy Dwyer
for the dunk!

12:43.229 --> 12:44.902
Oh, that wall is so close.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.310
Doctors, the operation
is now complete.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.380
Dr. Zoe, could you please use the
reflex hammer to see if she's okay?

12:51.904 --> 12:54.680
ANN: <i>This is the most fun
I have ever had with kids.</i>

12:55.107 --> 12:57.451
<i>They even said they want to
be doctors when they grow up.</i>

12:58.010 --> 12:59.853
Hot tip for you
babysitters out there?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.649
Let your kids play with
medical tools all the time.

13:02.882 --> 13:04.589
We have a problem.
What? Oh, my God.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.256
Girls, this is
not a negotiation.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.957
Unlock the door
immediately.

13:09.021 --> 13:12.798
No! We're doing surgery. Only
doctors are allowed in here.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.805
Okay.
Stand back, ladies.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.670
Ron. No, no, no, no!
That's dangerous.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.175
Somebody in here has
got to have keys, right?

13:19.231 --> 13:21.302
I have keys. What...
Jerry.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.275
I never thought I would say this,
but I am so glad you're here.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.646
Well, it's got to be
one of these, right?

13:28.674 --> 13:30.915
Oh, no. Ladies?
No, no, no, no, no!

13:30.976 --> 13:34.014
The patient needs a haircut.
Her hair is infected.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.081
RON: Hurry, Jerry! Okay, I'm trying.
It's not this one.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.354
No.

13:37.416 --> 13:38.656
Okay. I'm not good
under pressure like this.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.390
Zoe, stop it!
Please.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.587
No!

13:41.654 --> 13:42.758
Zoe,
put the scissors down.

13:43.622 --> 13:44.692
Oh!

13:46.025 --> 13:47.333
No!

13:47.893 --> 13:50.339
<i>Geuseuuey</i>

13:51.530 --> 13:52.873
Bakery called this in.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.542
Needs to go on that
truck right there.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.603
Easy, breezy, beautiful.

13:56.702 --> 13:58.682
That's the CoverGirl slogan.
I didn't mean to say that.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.580
Okay. Here we go.
On three.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.748
Okay. Two.
One. Three. Move it.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.252
(GRUNTING)

14:07.079 --> 14:09.116
On four, five, six.
Here we go.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.127
You need a hand? No, no.
We don't need a hand.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.391
What, do you think Joan
of Arc needed a hand?

14:14.453 --> 14:16.023
Doing what? Let me
tell you something.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.695
We are not leaving until this
symbolic feminist obstacle

14:19.758 --> 14:22.329
is loaded onto that truck
of women's advancement.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.667
And you can put that
on the record, Shauna.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.504
Well, you ladies clearly
have everything in hand.

14:26.565 --> 14:27.942
Dewey and I are going
to head back to base.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.338
Hope we didn't
throw you off schedule.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.812
Not at all.
Have fun.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.642
Hey, Shauna, maybe... Maybe not
put this part on the record.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.345
You know, leave the earlier
part on the record.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.354
But if we can't get this
fridge onto the truck,

14:38.410 --> 14:39.946
then maybe not put
that on the record,

14:40.012 --> 14:41.514
and then just destroy
the record altogether.

14:41.647 --> 14:42.921
Okay. Guys, I'm going to
go ahead and decide

14:42.982 --> 14:45.087
what's on and off the
record on my own. Cool?

14:45.684 --> 14:46.685
Uh-huh.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.355
LESLIE: <i>The whole city
is watching.</i>

14:48.520 --> 14:50.898
If I can't move that
fridge onto that truck,

14:50.956 --> 14:52.799
then feminism is over
in this town.

14:54.660 --> 14:55.832
(GRUNTING)

15:00.399 --> 15:03.039
I don't know why I thought
sneaking up on it would work.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.740
This is the one.
This is...

15:06.805 --> 15:08.307
Why do you have
so many keys?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.418
We did surgery,
just like you taught us.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.549
Okay. You know what? Why don't you
girls clean up all of this hair,

15:14.647 --> 15:15.682
and I'm going
to talk to Ron?

15:15.814 --> 15:16.884
Let's cut off our toes!

15:16.949 --> 15:17.984
No, let's not.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.687
I'm going to
take this bag, too.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.594
You need to fix this.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.423
It's not that bad.
Nobody got hurt.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.930
It's extremely bad.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.496
I love this woman. And I
just want to show her

15:27.559 --> 15:29.505
that I'm capable of
watching her children

15:29.561 --> 15:31.234
without something
horrible happening.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.405
What?

15:33.499 --> 15:35.501
Did you just say
you love Diane?

15:35.567 --> 15:37.171
No. I did not.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.773
Yes, you did.
That is so cute.

15:39.838 --> 15:43.342
For God's sake, Hanson, will you
please focus on the larger problem?

15:43.509 --> 15:44.783
(MIMICKING KISSING)

15:44.843 --> 15:47.585
<i>BOTH: Ron loves Mommy</i>

15:47.813 --> 15:49.986
<i>Ron loves Mommy</i>

15:50.082 --> 15:52.790
Girls, girls. I don't know
what you think you heard,

15:52.851 --> 15:54.853
but please don't
tell your mother

15:54.920 --> 15:56.900
what you incorrectly

I love nothing!
(LAUGHING)

16:05.064 --> 16:06.805
I'm going to have to
start writing this up soon.

16:06.865 --> 16:07.866
Kind of sucks.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.935
I thought maybe we'd be done
in time to grab a drink. Oh.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.209
Have you been to Bistro D'Amour?
It's really romantic.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.306
Ooh.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.908
Yeah, it was just
going to be you and me,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.476
my sister,
a few people from work,

16:16.542 --> 16:17.543
and my ex-boyfriend.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.451
(CHUCKLING)
That's really confusing.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.583
I have a request.

16:21.714 --> 16:25.161
Could you please make sure that my
involvement in this stays off the record?

16:25.517 --> 16:27.724
I wouldn't want anyone
thinking that you are biased

16:27.786 --> 16:29.891
because we are something.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.366
You don't have to
worry about that.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.766
I'm going to include
a disclaimer describing

16:32.825 --> 16:34.099
the nature of
our relationship.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.499
I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow's
paper to find out our status.

16:39.231 --> 16:42.007
Why did I have to fall for
somebody from the old media?

16:43.102 --> 16:45.446
Maybe we should just
eat the refrigerator.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.847
If we start chewing now, we can
finish before the sun comes up.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.544
We have to
solve this problem.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.519
Or they're going to
point to this forever

16:52.578 --> 16:53.784
as a reason
to not hire women.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.917
I should never
have taken the bait.

16:56.048 --> 16:59.621
It was just such tasty,
righteously flavored bait.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.223
(sums)

17:01.286 --> 17:02.492
You here to
move the fridge?

17:02.621 --> 17:04.692
(GASPS) Are you a ghost?
Yes, we are.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.167
Why you think
you can lift it?

17:06.892 --> 17:08.666
You are
two little canaries.

17:08.993 --> 17:12.406
Those garbage men couldn't even lift it.
They are like giant bears.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.567
Hold on.
What do you mean?

17:14.633 --> 17:16.670
Bears are bigger
than canaries, yes?

17:16.734 --> 17:18.442
So, if bears can't
lift the thing...

17:18.503 --> 17:20.450
No, I understand
animal sizes.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.144
What do you mean,
they couldn't lift it?

17:22.608 --> 17:26.181
They try three days ago.
And it does not budge.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.054
They say they're going to
come back with more guys,

17:28.113 --> 17:29.854
but they come back
with canaries.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.053
Fly away,
little canaries.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.797
Those Sanitation goons
set us up.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.298
You know what? Let's just go.
What?

17:39.458 --> 17:40.994
No. We can't
let them beat us.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.370
Just call it a tie.
Nobody can lift it.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.700
No, Leslie. We do not want to tie.
We want to win.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.610
Those guys suck. Okay?
We have to prove them wrong.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.779
Look, all we have to do
is get some PCP.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.475
You can move anything
on angel dust.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.582
My cousin, Hess, said he beat
off five cops on that stuff.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.086
Okay, hold on. Sir?

17:57.242 --> 17:58.653
Does this
refrigerator still work?

17:58.710 --> 18:00.053
Works okay.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.159
We got a new one.
We don't need it.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.261
So what if those kids think you're
the lamest guy in the world?

18:07.319 --> 18:09.856
That's not who you want shopping
at Rent A Swag anyways, Tom.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.959
That's exactly who I want
shopping at Rent A Swag.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.695
Oh. Well, then,
that sucks.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.929
Look. I want
to show you something.

18:20.065 --> 18:23.410
Okay, this is Kevin Durant and
Russell Westbrook after a bad loss.

18:23.502 --> 18:27.644
Even the greats get beat. But they get back
out there the next day and they fight.

18:28.006 --> 18:30.179
So, let's hit
the gym again tomorrow.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.855
Guys, I think I just
dribbled up an idea.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.783
No. Double dribbled it.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.321
You have learned nothing
about basketball.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.057
You're a good friend,
Ben.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.291
Oh. Thanks.

18:41.887 --> 18:45.664
Can I borrow $1,500? You're not
allowed to ask what it's for.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.126
Fireworks.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.503
First of all, everyone is fine.
No one got hurt.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.607
But there was
an incident.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.603
Oh, my God.
What happened?

18:57.603 --> 18:59.276
ANN: Diane,
this is all my fault.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.443
I let them go
into my nurse's bag.

19:01.707 --> 19:02.879
(LAUGHING) Oh.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.579
(RON LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

19:04.643 --> 19:06.054
Well, who has
been having fun

19:06.111 --> 19:07.419
with scissors?
Us!

19:07.546 --> 19:10.322
Ann taught us how to be doctors.
Yay!

19:10.382 --> 19:11.520
You're not mad?

19:11.583 --> 19:13.028
No, it's fine.
They're kids.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.962
Once, Zoe put
Ivy in the dryer.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.101
I'm still incredibly sorry.
I feel like I let you down.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.203
It is so sweet to me
how much you care.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.268
This is why I love you.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.675
Oh.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.535
I love you, too.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.804
(LAUGHS)

19:29.868 --> 19:31.040
That's my cue.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.510
All right, girls.
Good hang.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.309
Bye, Ann!
Bye, Ann!

19:36.141 --> 19:38.815
Hey, Leslie? Shaunajust
sent me the disclaimer

19:38.877 --> 19:40.788
that she's going to use before
she prints the article.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.720
"City Manager Chris Traeger
was present for this event,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.622
"and has a personal
relationship with the author."

19:46.685 --> 19:48.062
Okay.
That's pretty good, right?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.566
Personal relationship.
It's not romantic.

19:51.089 --> 19:53.296
But it is descriptive. No,
it's not even descriptive.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.627
I know you're
not used to this,

19:54.693 --> 19:58.334
but maybe you should just try to
keep it chill and see what happens.

19:58.630 --> 19:59.870
Great advice.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.843
Impossible to follow,
but great advice.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.914
So, do you think the soup
kitchen could use that fridge?

20:06.038 --> 20:09.042
I mean, April and I were going to
haul it onto the truck effortlessly.

20:09.107 --> 20:10.415
But if you need it.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.149
Absolutely. This is a godsend.
Thank you for thinking of us.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.018
Grab a side, ladies. I think all
of us can get it on the truck.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.224
LESLIE: <i>Not only did we complete the garbage
route, and move an unmovable fridge,</i>

20:21.486 --> 20:25.901
<i>but the Sanitation department hired
three new female trash haulers.</i>

20:26.325 --> 20:27.668
And best of all,

20:27.726 --> 20:30.798
April gave me this present to
commemorate our feminist victory.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.370
And it's trash.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.746
It's filled with trash.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.812
Maybe there's something
on the bottom here.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.509
Let me see.
No, just trash.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.886
This is Brandon Turnbill
for Kid's 46 news.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.754
I'm here with the star of
today's win, Josh Diamond.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.253
What was the key to
the victory, Josh?

20:52.317 --> 20:54.854
Everything just came together
for us, and we came out on top.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.530
And we're going to try to keep it
going next week against Snerling.

20:57.923 --> 20:58.993
Thanks, tiny reporter.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.304
It was a huge win
for Josh and the boys.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.931
And after a huge win,
be sure to visit
