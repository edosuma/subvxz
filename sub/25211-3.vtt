00:10.776 --> 00:12.146
Clay woke up.

00:14.447 --> 00:17.187
Henry.

00:17.216 --> 00:19.786
- Are you okay? Henry?
- I have to go.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.720
- My God.
- Henry?

00:22.755 --> 00:24.525
I'm sorry.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.757
Are you okay?

00:34.166 --> 00:36.436
I can't... I can't...
I can't breathe.

00:38.270 --> 00:39.440
Jenna, get back!

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:52.818 --> 00:55.318
Did you guys hear that?
It sounded like an explosion!

00:55.354 --> 00:56.824
Was that a gunshot?

00:56.856 --> 00:58.696
Holy shit! This is crazy!

01:01.127 --> 01:02.567
Evacuation protocol now!

01:02.595 --> 01:04.595
Henry? Let's get out of here.

01:20.579 --> 01:22.779
Holy shit.

01:22.815 --> 01:24.285
Where did she go?

01:24.316 --> 01:26.556
I-I don't know.

01:30.589 --> 01:33.629
- Did she do this?
- Just shut up, okay?

01:41.767 --> 01:43.537
Attention all faculty
and students...

01:43.569 --> 01:45.509
Please evacuate the building
immediately.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.578
Maybe we should tell them
there wasn't a bomb.

01:47.606 --> 01:50.246
No, no, Townes, you can't say
anything to anyone, okay?

01:50.276 --> 01:52.346
As quickly and orderly
as possible.

01:52.378 --> 01:54.348
We need to get out of here.
Come on.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.380
Go.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.741
Fuck.

02:16.769 --> 02:19.309
Hello?

02:19.338 --> 02:20.708
Thomas?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.509
What are you doing here?

02:26.946 --> 02:29.346
I asked you a question.

02:33.485 --> 02:35.725
I... I don't know.

02:35.754 --> 02:37.194
Are you high?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.923
No, Mom, I'm not high.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.198
Did you have another seizure?

02:42.962 --> 02:44.932
No, I just forgot my homework.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.464
I have a test,
so I should probably go.

02:47.499 --> 02:49.599
Why didn't you tell me
you were in that car accident

02:49.635 --> 02:51.375
with Clay Boone?

02:53.672 --> 02:55.642
Who told you that?

02:55.674 --> 02:58.944
Why did you leave him there?

02:58.978 --> 03:01.378
Were you embarrassed?
Are you... are you two dating?

03:01.413 --> 03:02.591
Why would you think that? Why?

03:02.615 --> 03:04.315
It's nothing to be ashamed of!

03:04.350 --> 03:06.290
- It's fucking typical of you.
- Hey, hey, wait!

03:06.318 --> 03:07.818
Henry, wait.

03:07.853 --> 03:09.953
Would you please stop?

03:09.989 --> 03:11.533
What the hell else am
I supposed to think?

03:11.557 --> 03:13.297
You won't talk to me
about anything!

03:13.325 --> 03:14.903
What's the point? It's not
gonna change anything.

03:14.927 --> 03:16.697
- Maybe it would!
- No, no, no. I can't!

03:16.729 --> 03:20.499
I can't keep doing this
with you! It is not fair!

03:20.532 --> 03:22.332
I'm alone!

03:22.368 --> 03:25.868
I am completely alone here,
and it is because of you.

03:25.904 --> 03:28.604
It is your fault.
Do you not see that?

03:28.641 --> 03:33.411
Do you not, like, see anything
that you do to me at all?

03:33.445 --> 03:34.723
Then you stand there
and you think

03:34.747 --> 03:36.347
that I had sex with Clay?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.859
- Are you fucking serious?
- I never said...

03:37.883 --> 03:39.523
You are the one
who sleeps around!

03:39.551 --> 03:41.821
Okay, come back here right now!

03:41.854 --> 03:44.254
- Get back here right now!
- Just fucking leave me alone!

03:44.290 --> 03:45.760
You cannot talk to me that way!

04:39.745 --> 04:42.815
Dominick?

05:34.099 --> 05:37.139
You grew up
in the inner city, right?

05:37.169 --> 05:38.909
Just the city, sir.

05:38.937 --> 05:42.107
You ever have any shit like
this go on in your school?

05:42.141 --> 05:43.511
No.

05:48.847 --> 05:51.117
All students and faculty
please stay

05:51.150 --> 05:54.720
outside of the building
but on school grounds.

05:56.822 --> 05:58.922
All right, Eileen,
what do you got?

05:58.957 --> 06:00.627
There was an explosion,

06:00.659 --> 06:02.659
and the manual said to evacuate,

06:02.694 --> 06:04.734
but maybe we should've gone
into lockdown.

06:04.763 --> 06:06.603
- Is the building clear now?
- It should be.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.432
Bomb squad will be here
in 20 minutes.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.737
Nobody goes in until we
give the okay, understood?

06:10.769 --> 06:12.469
- Yes, Sheriff.
- All right.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.191
Shit.

07:41.226 --> 07:43.826
They got that big Lincoln game
coming up, don't they?

07:43.862 --> 07:45.102
Pretty aggressive prank.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.100
Yeah, well, you should see some

07:47.132 --> 07:49.532
of the crap these kids
have pulled.

07:49.568 --> 07:51.708
Yeah.

07:51.737 --> 07:54.107
Henry, wait!

07:54.139 --> 07:57.209
Henry! Henry! I saw
what you did!

07:57.242 --> 07:59.142
Townes, I can't talk
to you right now.

07:59.177 --> 08:01.077
- Henry...
- Townes, I do not have time

08:01.113 --> 08:02.583
- for this shit.
- Are you okay?

08:02.614 --> 08:04.584
You experienced
another episode, right?

08:04.616 --> 08:06.716
You told Townes?

08:06.752 --> 08:08.052
He figured it out.

08:08.086 --> 08:10.226
Your telekinesis has gotten
much stronger.

08:10.255 --> 08:12.855
Did you want to crush
the bathroom with your mind?

08:12.891 --> 08:14.135
- No.
- Telekinesis isn't a thing

08:14.159 --> 08:15.859
in life or in science.

08:15.894 --> 08:18.064
No, I had...

08:18.096 --> 08:20.066
I don't know.
I had, like, a panic attack.

08:20.098 --> 08:22.098
And I couldn't breathe,

08:22.134 --> 08:24.174
and my vision went out,

08:24.202 --> 08:26.302
and shit started to come
towards me,

08:26.338 --> 08:28.638
and then I was
in my bedroom, so...

08:28.674 --> 08:31.014
Instantaneously?

08:31.043 --> 08:33.113
Yeah.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.815
This changes everything. I...

08:35.847 --> 08:37.087
I need my books!

08:37.115 --> 08:39.085
Meet me at my house
in 34 minutes.

08:39.116 --> 08:40.687
Do you remember the address?

08:40.719 --> 08:41.962
Townes, we're not going
to your stupid...

08:41.986 --> 08:43.231
"Even the imagination
has a limit,

08:43.255 --> 08:45.325
"a point at which
our best creations

08:45.357 --> 08:47.257
"meet our worst fears.

08:47.292 --> 08:50.692
We are about to exceed
that limit."

08:52.331 --> 08:54.571
Come on, I'll take you home.

08:56.134 --> 09:00.304
I really thought
that medication would help.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.179
Maybe it still can.

09:04.943 --> 09:06.743
I need to talk to him.

09:08.113 --> 09:10.253
Who, Clay?

09:11.750 --> 09:12.890
Yeah.

09:13.885 --> 09:16.255
I need to know what he knows.

09:16.288 --> 09:18.358
And I need him to understand

09:18.390 --> 09:20.830
exactly what happened
before this gets out

09:20.859 --> 09:22.699
and gets, like, all...

09:22.728 --> 09:24.028
distorted or some...

09:24.062 --> 09:25.262
And you deserve that,

09:25.297 --> 09:27.167
but what happens
if you confront him...

09:27.199 --> 09:28.939
Jenna, it doesn't matter.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.837
He could tell, like,
Lucas or his dad,

09:31.870 --> 09:33.210
I mean, you have no idea

09:33.238 --> 09:35.778
how fucking dangerous
they are, Jenna.

09:40.946 --> 09:42.686
Can you take me
to Townes's house?

09:42.714 --> 09:44.254
Henry!

09:44.282 --> 09:46.352
Townes has no idea what
the hell he's talking about.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.985
I need to talk to Clay,
and for that to happen,

09:49.021 --> 09:51.221
I need to understand what
the fuck is going on with me.

09:51.256 --> 09:52.926
So, unless you have
some better idea,

09:52.958 --> 09:55.028
can you just please drive?

09:59.164 --> 10:00.864
I can't take your call
right now,

10:00.899 --> 10:02.739
but leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.068
Hey, Pop.

10:04.102 --> 10:06.242
Just wondering where you're at.

10:06.271 --> 10:09.111
Clay's asking for you.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.811
Call me back.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.326
Dad says he's on his way.

10:25.123 --> 10:27.693
So how'd it go with the doctor?

10:30.295 --> 10:32.335
You want some water?

10:34.232 --> 10:36.232
Well, how about a snack
or something?

10:36.268 --> 10:38.308
Lucas, I know what they said.

10:38.336 --> 10:40.236
But I'm telling you,

10:40.272 --> 10:43.312
I can feel my legs, all right?

10:43.341 --> 10:45.681
'Cause they hurt.

10:45.711 --> 10:48.711
And they wouldn't hurt
if I couldn't feel them.

10:48.747 --> 10:51.787
No, they... they wouldn't.

10:53.251 --> 10:55.251
Okay, well...

10:55.287 --> 10:57.087
I'll tell them that,

10:57.122 --> 10:59.292
and I'll make sure
that they listen, okay?

10:59.324 --> 11:01.024
Okay.

11:20.378 --> 11:23.918
Hey, Jake, could you grab
Thomas for me, please?

11:23.949 --> 11:26.149
- Sure thing, Ms. Coles.
- Thank you.

11:45.537 --> 11:47.837
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.873
Um, I'm Cleo Coles
from the diner.

11:49.908 --> 11:52.178
I'm Thomas Hope's girlfriend,
and...

11:52.210 --> 11:54.350
I just... I wanted to say...

11:54.379 --> 11:56.919
how sorry I am about Clay.

12:09.094 --> 12:11.864
He woke up today.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.237
That's, um...

12:13.265 --> 12:15.165
that's great.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.870
How's he doing?

12:16.902 --> 12:18.772
I don't know.

12:18.804 --> 12:22.274
I got the call, and...

12:22.307 --> 12:24.947
I ended up here.

12:27.078 --> 12:31.248
He had a real shot of getting
out of this town, you know?

12:31.283 --> 12:34.383
Syracuse and Connecticut
were already scouting him.

12:40.125 --> 12:43.495
Coming up on 13 years.

12:43.528 --> 12:46.298
Long time to go without a drink.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.475
Be a shame not
to make it to 13...

12:52.504 --> 12:54.474
being such
a lucky number and all.

13:07.152 --> 13:09.392
Hey, what...

13:09.421 --> 13:10.561
what was that?

13:10.589 --> 13:12.489
I was asking him about Clay.

13:12.524 --> 13:14.424
I thought it was
the right thing to do,

13:14.459 --> 13:17.159
since Henry was in the car with
him the night of the accident.

13:17.195 --> 13:19.835
But you knew that
already, right?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.567
Really? Nothing?

13:23.602 --> 13:25.342
I did what I thought was right.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.310
Okay.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.283
And I'm not gonna apologize
for trying to protect your kid.

13:29.307 --> 13:30.907
Protect my...
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:30.942 --> 13:32.482
- Hey...
- Where do you get off?

13:32.510 --> 13:34.388
How would you feel if I kept
secrets about Jenna from you?

13:34.412 --> 13:35.523
- Okay. Hey!
- Would you like that?

13:35.547 --> 13:37.247
I get it, okay?

13:37.282 --> 13:38.952
I do.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.024
But with you, Cleo,
it's always yours or mine.

13:41.052 --> 13:42.352
Right? We live together now.

13:42.387 --> 13:43.957
Don't you think
that we should be...

13:43.989 --> 13:45.399
We should... we should try
to parent together?

13:45.423 --> 13:46.993
Why would you think that?

13:47.025 --> 13:48.302
We've been together,
like, a couple of months.

13:48.326 --> 13:49.596
Four months!

13:49.628 --> 13:51.568
And moving in was your idea!

13:51.596 --> 13:53.336
Okay, well, clearly,
we rushed things,

13:53.365 --> 13:54.865
because Henry was
certainly not ready.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.440
This has nothing
to do with Henry.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.346
This is all about you, Cleo.
You haven't even unpacked.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.140
Can we please not go
over this again?

14:00.171 --> 14:01.449
Why do you feel the need
to be ready to go

14:01.473 --> 14:03.013
- at a moment's notice?
- I don't!

14:03.041 --> 14:04.118
- What are you so afraid of?
- Nothing!

14:04.142 --> 14:05.542
I am not afraid of anything!

14:05.577 --> 14:07.177
I don't even know
why I bother, Cleo.

14:07.212 --> 14:08.556
We both know I'm gonna
come home some night

14:08.580 --> 14:10.024
- and you're both gonna be gone.
- Okay.

14:10.048 --> 14:11.648
And, fuck,
you're packed already.

14:11.683 --> 14:13.883
- Fuck off!
- You know what? You first.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.559
- You first!
- Okay, fine.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.190
Shit.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.308
Why even bother knocking?

15:04.336 --> 15:06.436
I thought my friend
would open the door.

15:06.471 --> 15:10.211
You should not be here.

15:10.241 --> 15:14.251
- I come bearing gifts.
- No, I don't want whatever...

15:15.981 --> 15:19.051
- Are those Przystanek?
- Krakow's finest.

15:28.326 --> 15:29.726
What do you want?

15:29.761 --> 15:31.305
I paid a visit to everyone
on your list.

15:31.329 --> 15:32.529
No one will talk.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.134
Well, everyone's
a paid employee.

15:34.165 --> 15:36.335
If they'd rather die
than talk, well...

15:37.402 --> 15:39.072
Yeah. That's fucking delicious.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.544
There was a man this last time.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.643
He knew I was coming.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.480
And he had this.

15:50.515 --> 15:52.460
It emitted a sound that
prevented me from traveling,

15:52.484 --> 15:54.454
at least, in the way
I'm used to.

15:54.486 --> 15:57.356
- If I can find him, then...
- No.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.689
- All I'm asking...
- No.

15:58.723 --> 16:00.293
- Is for you to take a look...
- No.

16:00.325 --> 16:02.625
See if you know
where it came from.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.400
Please, Sam.

16:04.429 --> 16:06.499
I have nowhere else to go.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.339
You know, Townes is good
at science.

16:13.371 --> 16:14.741
Not great.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.413
Sometimes he gets a bit confused

16:16.441 --> 16:18.281
about which is science
and which is fiction.

16:18.309 --> 16:21.049
For not liking the guy,
you sure know a lot about him.

16:24.649 --> 16:27.689
Jenna Faith Hope.
It's been a minute.

16:27.719 --> 16:30.789
Faith?
Your middle name is Faith?

16:30.822 --> 16:32.492
Shut up.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.194
This is Henry.
She's not my friend.

16:35.226 --> 16:38.126
Hey. Meghan. Come on in.

16:40.231 --> 16:42.201
Faith Hope.

16:43.368 --> 16:47.038
Holy shit, I can't believe they
thought that was a good idea.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.312
Townes, you got company.

16:50.341 --> 16:53.441
He mentioned
he might have friends over,

16:53.478 --> 16:56.248
but he's thought that
before, and...

16:56.281 --> 16:58.681
Anyway, I'm trying to think
of the last time I saw you.

16:58.716 --> 17:00.816
Yeah, I don't know.

17:00.852 --> 17:03.122
How's high school?

17:03.154 --> 17:04.454
It's school.

17:04.489 --> 17:06.289
Jenna's very popular.

17:06.324 --> 17:09.324
- Are you home on break?
- Yeah, but being back sucks.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.500
I kind of found my people
in college,

17:11.529 --> 17:13.569
and Reston, well...

17:13.598 --> 17:15.137
- You know.
- Totally.

17:18.303 --> 17:19.573
You came.

17:19.604 --> 17:21.374
And you're right on ti...

17:21.406 --> 17:25.205
Or... Actually,
you're two minutes early.

17:28.445 --> 17:29.716
After you.

17:31.649 --> 17:33.619
Tell me exactly what happens.

17:33.651 --> 17:35.521
I get this feeling...

17:35.553 --> 17:38.323
like the world starts
to pull away,

17:38.356 --> 17:41.796
and then my hearing goes out,

17:41.826 --> 17:43.726
and suddenly I'm in my bedroom.

17:43.761 --> 17:46.231
Always to your bedroom?

17:46.264 --> 17:48.164
Yeah, every time.

17:48.199 --> 17:50.639
Is there anything specific
you feel?

17:50.668 --> 17:52.738
I'm looking for a pattern.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.810
Um...

17:57.575 --> 18:01.345
It sometimes happens if
somebody gets too close to me.

18:01.379 --> 18:03.549
Before my mom knew
I didn't like to be touched,

18:03.581 --> 18:05.481
she'd hug me and hug me
and hug me.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.161
She thought that that's
what I was missing,

18:07.185 --> 18:09.385
but hugs can hurt. They can...

18:09.420 --> 18:11.560
Actually, they can feel
a lot like fire.

18:11.589 --> 18:14.289
It happens
when you're scared, too, right?

18:14.325 --> 18:17.125
When I told you about Clay
waking up, you...

18:17.162 --> 18:19.602
But, I don't... I don't know.
I could be wrong.

18:19.631 --> 18:23.231
No, fear's interesting.
It motivates a lot of behavior.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.138
I think I know what's going on
and possibly how to control it,

18:26.171 --> 18:27.771
but in order to prove my theory,

18:27.805 --> 18:30.445
we need to induce another event.

18:30.475 --> 18:32.475
You want to scare the shit
out of me?

18:32.510 --> 18:33.610
Why?

18:33.645 --> 18:35.745
To prove you can teleport.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.480
- Townes...
- That's impossible.

18:37.515 --> 18:39.215
Scientists have only been able

18:39.250 --> 18:40.920
to teleport elementary
particles,

18:40.952 --> 18:43.822
and even then, they're just
copies of the original.

18:43.855 --> 18:45.555
Then maybe Henry's
making copies of herself

18:45.590 --> 18:47.890
every time she teleports.

18:47.926 --> 18:52.266
Maybe this isn't
even the original Henry.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.797
I mean, it would make more sense

18:53.831 --> 18:55.471
if you were generating
a wormhole.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.900
- Like a singularity?
- A naked singularity.

18:57.936 --> 19:02.906
What? What the fuck
is a single-naked wormhole?

19:02.941 --> 19:04.841
What are you talking about?

19:04.876 --> 19:07.676
And since when did you become
such a huge nerd, Jenna?

19:07.712 --> 19:09.352
It's like you're leading
a double life.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.920
A wormhole is a black hole,
like in space.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.750
But one you can travel through.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.763
Well, theoretically,
but the amount of mass it takes

19:15.787 --> 19:17.727
to create one is insane.

19:17.755 --> 19:19.695
But what if fear has mass?

19:19.724 --> 19:22.194
No, emotions don't have mass.

19:22.227 --> 19:26.397
This is fucking bat shit.
This is nuts!

19:26.431 --> 19:27.971
Right?

19:27.999 --> 19:30.639
It kind of explains
why the bathroom imploded.

19:30.668 --> 19:32.508
Energy was drawn toward you.

19:32.537 --> 19:34.277
And you always end up back
in your bedroom,

19:34.305 --> 19:37.845
which is arbitrary to physics,
but unique to you.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.512
And this makes sense to you?

19:42.547 --> 19:46.247
In a completely
"detached from reality" way,

19:46.284 --> 19:48.324
yes.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.553
But it's all theoretical
until we test it.

19:59.397 --> 20:00.967
Then let's scare the shit
out of me.

20:16.481 --> 20:17.721
No, I can't.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.419
- No fucking way.
- Henry, wait!

20:19.450 --> 20:22.250
Jenna, there is no fucking way

20:22.287 --> 20:23.987
that I'm gonna jump
off that thing.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.722
- No!
- Henry, just...

20:25.757 --> 20:27.797
It's not fair!

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
And what if it doesn't work?

20:31.496 --> 20:33.040
There's such a good chance
that it just,

20:33.064 --> 20:35.664
like, won't work, Jenna.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.470
But if... if we're right,

20:37.502 --> 20:39.642
your body won't even
let you hit the water.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.377
Fuck.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.379
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

20:56.587 --> 20:58.727
Fuck me.

21:15.073 --> 21:16.843
Whoa.

21:31.856 --> 21:33.996
Stupid fucking... Shit!

21:34.025 --> 21:35.795
Actually, this was very helpful.

21:35.827 --> 21:38.497
Disproving theories is just
as important as proving them.

21:38.529 --> 21:39.729
Fuck off, Townes.

21:39.764 --> 21:41.834
Maybe you can go warm up
the car.

21:47.038 --> 21:50.838
What am I gonna do now?

21:50.875 --> 21:52.775
What if I go talk to Clay?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.988
Patty's already at the hospital
with some of Clay's friends.

21:55.012 --> 21:56.952
I could find out
what he remembers,

21:56.981 --> 21:58.521
if anything.

22:00.451 --> 22:02.821
Okay?

22:05.857 --> 22:08.497
Betty, can I get a Scotch?

22:08.526 --> 22:11.066
Preferably something that
doesn't taste like a campfire.

22:11.095 --> 22:13.795
- Where's Thomas?
- Not here.

22:13.831 --> 22:16.731
One of those kind of days?

22:16.768 --> 22:17.768
Thanks.

22:27.945 --> 22:29.685
I mean, I'd apologize,
but it's Marky Mark.

22:29.714 --> 22:31.054
Marky Mark?

22:31.082 --> 22:32.952
That's not...
That's C+C Music Factory.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.524
No, it's not. It's Marky Mark.

22:34.552 --> 22:35.922
I'm positive.

22:35.953 --> 22:38.023
My band used to do
a country cover of it.

22:38.055 --> 22:39.955
You did this country style?

22:39.991 --> 22:41.891
Yeah, it's a choice.

22:52.804 --> 22:54.034
Boom.

22:54.071 --> 22:55.841
Well, are you guys
performing tonight?

22:55.873 --> 22:57.973
I mean, I'd love to see you.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.179
No, we're not. We broke up
a long time ago.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.419
But I'll sing along
to anything on the jukebox

23:06.451 --> 23:09.021
for a two-drink minimum.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.529
That's one.

23:31.976 --> 23:34.446
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

23:34.479 --> 23:37.719
Yeah, I...

23:37.748 --> 23:41.118
I need a wheelchair.
My son is...

23:42.653 --> 23:45.453
Paralyzed.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.160
I see.

23:47.191 --> 23:51.201
Can you tell me where on
the spine the injury occurred?

23:51.229 --> 23:53.199
Well, I don't...

23:53.231 --> 23:54.971
Does that matter?

23:54.999 --> 23:56.569
Well, believe it or not,
it does.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.801
See, every chair
is designed specifically

23:58.836 --> 24:00.806
to a person's injury.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.007
That one looks good.

24:04.041 --> 24:06.741
Yes, that... that's
a very good chair,

24:06.777 --> 24:09.017
but it might not be right
for your son.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.916
See, if I know
how much mobility he has,

24:10.948 --> 24:12.548
then we can refine your search.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.183
He's strong. He's an athlete.

24:14.218 --> 24:16.758
I see. Well, if you'd like,

24:16.787 --> 24:18.487
I can get you a list
of questions

24:18.523 --> 24:20.163
to ask your son's doctor,

24:20.191 --> 24:22.135
and then perhaps you can come
back with those details...

24:22.159 --> 24:24.229
I'm here now.
I can't see him without...

24:24.262 --> 24:25.962
We just want to be sure

24:25.997 --> 24:27.967
that we choose a chair
that best fits his needs.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.199
Don't tell me what we want.

24:30.234 --> 24:32.834
Just give me that one!

24:32.870 --> 24:34.070
Yes, sir.

24:34.105 --> 24:36.575
Yes, sir. Of course.

24:44.282 --> 24:47.152
Hey, Jenna. Glad you made it.

24:47.184 --> 24:49.184
Me too.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.192
Hey.

24:54.091 --> 24:55.891
What's going on?
Why is everybody out here?

24:55.927 --> 24:59.127
The nurses won't let us in.
They said it's family only.

24:59.163 --> 25:01.263
It's total bullshit.

25:01.299 --> 25:03.799
Hey, do you guys want
to sign Clay's card?

25:03.834 --> 25:07.004
Yeah.

25:25.222 --> 25:27.562
What are you doing here?

25:29.293 --> 25:30.763
Is Henry with you?

25:30.795 --> 25:32.835
She told me what you did to her.

25:32.863 --> 25:34.303
That's some psycho shit,

25:34.332 --> 25:36.072
putting a girl in the trunk
of your car.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.670
I'm not psycho.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.012
You're lucky
we didn't call the police.

25:39.036 --> 25:40.676
Well, then she'd have to explain

25:40.705 --> 25:42.105
what she did to my car, right?

25:42.139 --> 25:43.809
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:43.841 --> 25:45.981
Okay, this isn't a joke.
My brother is a paraplegic.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.210
His life is over, and nobody
seems to give a shit.

25:48.245 --> 25:50.685
Well, maybe it's his own fault.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.755
What did you just say?

25:54.051 --> 25:56.621
Just...

25:56.654 --> 25:58.954
stay away from Henry.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.130
She's been through enough.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.134
Here's one.

26:18.209 --> 26:21.209
I literally have no idea
what that is.

26:21.245 --> 26:23.357
- Sing the hook so that I can...
- That's it. That's the hook.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.881
That's the hook? It sounds
like elevator music.

26:25.916 --> 26:28.716
That's "Think Twice"
by Celine Dion.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.953
Okay, that's not even
a real song. Come on.

26:30.988 --> 26:32.228
How can you say that?

26:32.256 --> 26:34.656
That was, like, a...
That was a huge hit.

26:34.692 --> 26:36.392
That's not a hit. No, no.

26:36.427 --> 26:38.697
The song from "Titanic"
was a huge hit.

26:38.729 --> 26:40.340
Whatever that is...
Whatever you just sang,

26:40.364 --> 26:43.634
that's... that's a bonus track
at Starbucks.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.968
My God, that's...

26:45.002 --> 26:47.072
You just broke
Celine Dion's heart...

26:47.104 --> 26:49.404
- Yeah.
- With that.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.140
Let me ask you something. Um...

26:54.045 --> 26:59.015
Do you know
any decent restaurants nearby?

26:59.050 --> 27:01.790
My car's in the shop, and I'm
kind of trapped in this town

27:01.819 --> 27:03.389
until I can get it fixed.

27:05.923 --> 27:07.363
What?

27:07.391 --> 27:10.861
Nothing. It's just, um...

27:10.895 --> 27:13.695
my car broke down here, too.

27:13.731 --> 27:15.831
And I never left.

27:20.404 --> 27:23.374
Well, I can see how this town
could grow on you.

27:27.311 --> 27:29.051
Have dinner with me.

27:38.389 --> 27:40.459
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

27:40.491 --> 27:43.031
Okay. What exactly can you feel?

27:43.060 --> 27:44.460
Can you describe it to me?

27:44.495 --> 27:48.065
Shooting pains
all up and down my leg.

27:48.099 --> 27:49.369
That means something.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.200
Right?

27:51.235 --> 27:54.305
Not necessarily.

27:54.338 --> 27:55.778
There he is.

27:55.806 --> 27:57.276
Dad.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.978
What is this?

27:59.009 --> 28:01.279
I'm not gonna need
that thing, all right?

28:01.312 --> 28:02.312
I-I can feel my legs.

28:02.346 --> 28:04.146
Clay, that's not quite...

28:04.181 --> 28:06.093
What you're experiencing,
it's called "phantom pain."

28:06.117 --> 28:08.157
Why don't you just get
this out of here?

28:08.185 --> 28:09.955
What are you talking about?

28:09.987 --> 28:11.487
It's the nicest chair
on the market.

28:11.522 --> 28:13.200
Yeah, but he's not gonna
be able to get himself

28:13.224 --> 28:14.468
in and out of this
fucking thing.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.192
If you'd been here,
you would know that.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.105
Who the hell says he can't
do that in this chair?

28:18.129 --> 28:19.840
Mr. Boone, perhaps we could
talk about this another time?

28:19.864 --> 28:21.734
Can we please just go
to the cafeteria

28:21.766 --> 28:23.276
- and let the nurse work?
- I just got here!

28:23.300 --> 28:25.770
No, no, Lucas, it's fine.
I want him to stay.

28:25.803 --> 28:27.403
You hear that?
My boy wants me here.

28:27.438 --> 28:29.149
- Maybe you should leave.
- No, that's not what I'm...

28:29.173 --> 28:30.473
Why do you need to be like this?

28:30.508 --> 28:31.978
Because I don't need you
telling me

28:32.009 --> 28:33.379
what I can and can't do!

28:33.410 --> 28:35.150
Gentlemen, please,
this is a hospital!

28:35.179 --> 28:37.119
Wait, something's wrong.

28:37.148 --> 28:39.518
- Shit! Are you okay?
- Look... look at his leg!

28:39.550 --> 28:41.094
- What? What's happening?
- It's gonna be okay.

28:41.118 --> 28:42.229
What's happening?
Why am I sweating?

28:42.253 --> 28:43.923
The hot coffee just spilled,

28:43.954 --> 28:45.499
and the sweat is your body's
way of telling you

28:45.523 --> 28:47.123
that something is wrong.

28:47.158 --> 28:49.958
Now, maybe the two of you
want to step outside

28:49.994 --> 28:51.864
until I'm done here... thank you.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.006
- Wait. Why...
- You're good.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.270
Why can't I feel it?

28:54.298 --> 28:56.338
- There we go.
- Hey.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.207
- Hey. Why can't I feel it?
- It's all good.

29:02.807 --> 29:04.377
Why can't I feel it?

29:25.329 --> 29:27.129
- Hey, Yvette.
- Hey.

29:27.164 --> 29:29.364
Didn't think I'd get you.
Then why'd you call?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.500
Be nice.

29:31.535 --> 29:33.305
I didn't get your RSVP,

29:33.337 --> 29:36.107
so I figured you're not coming
to the party.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.480
But I wanted to double-check.

29:39.977 --> 29:43.017
Yeah... I...

29:43.047 --> 29:44.887
Yeah, I don't know.

29:44.915 --> 29:47.415
You're gonna have to come
back home sometime.

29:47.451 --> 29:49.251
Folks will understand.

29:49.286 --> 29:51.326
Yeah, like Aunt Marie?

29:51.355 --> 29:54.355
Aunt Marie is a drunk with a
trick hip and a forked tongue.

29:54.391 --> 29:56.591
Nobody listens to that woman.

29:56.627 --> 29:58.827
Just come.

29:58.863 --> 30:01.463
Ruby is dying to see her auntie.

30:01.498 --> 30:03.498
And Dad?

30:09.607 --> 30:11.407
All units, we have a 10-39,

30:11.442 --> 30:13.119
convenience store at Lakewood
and Highway 68.

30:13.143 --> 30:14.883
Okay. I got to go.

30:14.912 --> 30:16.089
Hey, you're gonna let me know.

30:16.113 --> 30:17.183
- Right?
- I got to go!

30:17.214 --> 30:18.454
Unit 29 responding.

30:32.429 --> 30:35.469
Hey.

30:39.169 --> 30:41.169
So what happened?
Did you see him?

30:41.205 --> 30:45.005
Nobody was allowed in.

30:46.510 --> 30:49.150
- What?
- Lucas was there.

30:49.179 --> 30:50.649
I swear to God...

30:50.681 --> 30:52.981
There's too much testosterone
in that family.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.887
- What did he do?
- Nothing, but...

30:56.120 --> 30:58.660
Henry, Clay's a paraplegic.

31:05.095 --> 31:10.035
- I'm sorry, um...
- No...

31:10.067 --> 31:12.607
But it is not your fault.

31:12.636 --> 31:15.406
Right? This never
would've happened if Clay...

31:17.975 --> 31:19.975
He deserves it.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.588
Henry, talk to me.-

31:27.318 --> 31:29.918
You should get that.

31:29.954 --> 31:32.254
No, it can wait.

31:32.289 --> 31:36.259
No, seriously, Jenna, get it.

31:36.293 --> 31:38.193
This is on me. This is my thing.

31:38.228 --> 31:40.368
I shouldn't have sent you
to, like, deal with my shit.

31:44.268 --> 31:45.938
Seriously.

31:47.638 --> 31:49.938
I would rather be alone.

31:54.979 --> 31:56.319
Hey, Patty.

31:56.347 --> 31:57.947
Yeah, just give me a minute.

32:21.505 --> 32:24.145
Hey, are you hungry?
'Cause I can...

32:26.677 --> 32:28.077
Henry?

34:32.335 --> 34:33.335
Henry?

34:36.473 --> 34:38.373
Henry?

34:42.212 --> 34:43.681
Henry!

34:47.184 --> 34:48.724
Henry!

35:30.694 --> 35:33.634
Hello?

35:33.664 --> 35:36.164
Holy shit, Henry. Where are you?

35:38.235 --> 35:39.575
In my bedroom.

35:39.603 --> 35:41.643
It happened again.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.672
Yeah.

35:43.707 --> 35:45.677
We were right. It's fear.

35:45.709 --> 35:47.609
Why didn't you tell me?

35:47.644 --> 35:51.444
Because fear only works
if you're...

35:51.481 --> 35:53.281
really alone.

35:53.317 --> 35:56.717
You know, if there's
no safety net.

35:56.753 --> 35:58.553
It's like fight or flight,

35:58.589 --> 36:02.289
and if I can't fight, I think
my body will protect me.

36:04.962 --> 36:07.362
I got to go.

36:07.397 --> 36:09.637
What are you gonna tell him?

36:11.635 --> 36:13.935
The truth.

36:13.971 --> 36:17.711
Unit 21, 10-9, 10-39 confirmed.

36:18.976 --> 36:20.976
My guess is an overdose.

36:21.011 --> 36:22.811
Been seeing a lot
of junkies lately.

36:22.846 --> 36:25.216
He probably shot up
in the bathroom

36:25.249 --> 36:27.949
and collapsed out here.

36:27.985 --> 36:30.385
Have you ever seen him before?

36:30.420 --> 36:32.820
I don't know. Maybe.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:15.732 --> 37:17.502
Could you give me a hand
with this box?

37:17.534 --> 37:18.734
Yeah.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.809
Seriously, it's,
like, really heavy.

37:20.837 --> 37:22.507
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Thank you.

37:22.539 --> 37:23.909
- Wow.
- I know.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.680
I've got, like, 20 more, so...

37:26.710 --> 37:28.510
Here, wait. Wait a second.

37:28.545 --> 37:30.345
Um...

37:30.380 --> 37:33.520
I'm... I am really sorry about
what happened this morning.

37:33.550 --> 37:36.990
I-I never should've said
what I said. I...

37:37.020 --> 37:38.490
And you were totally right.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.822
I... should've told you
about Henry.

37:40.857 --> 37:44.357
Yeah, you should've.

37:44.394 --> 37:46.934
But you weren't
completely wrong either.

37:48.799 --> 37:51.299
I'm not going anywhere, Thomas.

37:52.869 --> 37:54.509
Good.

38:20.030 --> 38:22.500
Hey.

38:22.532 --> 38:24.332
I, um...

38:27.771 --> 38:29.841
You're paralyzed.

38:44.087 --> 38:45.757
Are you okay?

38:52.763 --> 38:55.803
Lucas says you called 911.

38:58.135 --> 39:00.705
Do you remember what happened?

39:03.940 --> 39:05.880
I remember you were there.

39:07.778 --> 39:09.478
And we were kissing.

39:11.448 --> 39:13.648
And after that...

39:17.087 --> 39:18.927
Yeah, I don't know.

39:21.858 --> 39:24.358
Do you remember?

39:32.569 --> 39:34.069
Yeah.

39:35.972 --> 39:39.882
We were in your truck,
and you...

39:39.910 --> 39:42.550
Hey!

39:42.579 --> 39:44.019
Please, stop!

39:45.916 --> 39:48.516
You were...

39:54.090 --> 39:56.830
We were attacked...

40:00.664 --> 40:04.704
By these guys that work
for your dad.

40:06.736 --> 40:09.636
They had, like, bats and clubs,

40:09.673 --> 40:12.073
and I just...

40:12.108 --> 40:13.878
I ran.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.885
What are you doing in here?
Visiting hours are over.

40:17.914 --> 40:20.114
- You need to leave right now.
- Okay.

40:20.150 --> 40:21.720
Henry.

40:25.489 --> 40:27.059
I'm glad you got away.

40:51.848 --> 40:54.218
Somebody grab him!

40:54.251 --> 40:57.921
Holy shit! What was that?

40:57.954 --> 41:00.524
- Somebody grab him!
- Holy shit! What was that?

41:00.557 --> 41:01.997
Whoa.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.567
I don't know what
to tell you, Dom. It's clean.

41:09.599 --> 41:12.569
There's no marking
of any kind that I can...

41:12.602 --> 41:14.202
There should be
an equalizer, though.

41:14.237 --> 41:16.607
Is... is this all there is?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.480
I think...

42:32.248 --> 42:33.948
Here.

42:38.355 --> 42:39.925
Is that where the sound
comes from?

42:41.958 --> 42:43.158
Shit!

42:44.961 --> 42:47.031
Fuck! Come on!

42:52.068 --> 42:53.808
It's a tracker, Dom.

42:53.837 --> 42:55.207
It's a fucking tracker.

42:55.238 --> 42:58.238
How long
have you had this on you?

42:58.274 --> 43:00.214
Dom! How long?

43:00.243 --> 43:02.613
Sabine!

43:13.923 --> 43:16.793
Tristan! Tristan!

43:25.435 --> 43:26.905
Tristan!

44:02.105 --> 44:03.845
Dominick.

44:16.286 --> 44:17.986
It's late.

44:18.021 --> 44:19.121
Yeah.

44:19.155 --> 44:21.355
I was at the hospital,

44:21.391 --> 44:23.831
um, visiting Clay.

44:23.860 --> 44:26.230
How is he?

44:26.262 --> 44:27.762
He's okay.

44:27.797 --> 44:29.337
Henry.

44:29.365 --> 44:33.275
You shouldn't have talked
to me like that earlier.

44:33.303 --> 44:35.173
I know, I'm sorry.

44:36.806 --> 44:38.276
You were right...

44:38.308 --> 44:41.448
about what I put you through.

44:41.478 --> 44:45.148
I'm trying to be better.
I want you to know that.

44:47.951 --> 44:50.391
The way I felt
about your dad was...

44:54.491 --> 44:58.031
Maybe I've been trying
to chase that feeling.

44:58.061 --> 45:00.031
Maybe I feel safer
if I move on from men

45:00.063 --> 45:03.803
before they have a chance
to move on from me.

45:03.833 --> 45:06.203
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

45:08.371 --> 45:11.071
Your father didn't leave me
for another woman.

45:12.342 --> 45:14.012
But you've always said that he...

45:14.043 --> 45:16.883
I know. I know what I said.
I just...

45:16.913 --> 45:18.983
I feel like now
that you're older, you...

45:19.015 --> 45:20.915
You should know the truth.

45:22.185 --> 45:24.085
Do you want to sit down?

45:28.458 --> 45:31.428
You remember how I used
to be in a band?

45:31.461 --> 45:33.401
Yeah.

45:33.429 --> 45:36.229
When you were about four,
I went on tour.

45:36.266 --> 45:38.406
It wasn't like it was
a tour tour.

45:38.434 --> 45:42.104
It was just a weekend away,
but I was so excited.

45:44.474 --> 45:47.514
And when I came home...

45:47.544 --> 45:50.214
you were all alone...

45:50.246 --> 45:52.286
and you were crying.

45:53.516 --> 45:57.386
He just left you
all by yourself.

45:59.556 --> 46:01.956
Your father just left you.

46:03.226 --> 46:05.326
I don't know.

46:05.361 --> 46:07.431
I know I'm not perfect.

46:07.463 --> 46:09.563
I know that. I know that
more than you know,

46:09.599 --> 46:11.899
but I would never leave you,
do you understand that?

46:14.604 --> 46:17.304
I'm here,
whether you like it or not.

46:19.242 --> 46:21.442
Maybe we could just...

46:21.477 --> 46:23.417
we could make a pact.

46:23.446 --> 46:25.916
No more secrets.

46:25.949 --> 46:28.819
We tell each other the truth,
even if it's hard.

46:32.021 --> 46:33.921
Okay.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.497
Come here.

46:37.293 --> 46:39.133
I love you, baby.
