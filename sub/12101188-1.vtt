WEBVTT

00:10.793 --> 00:13.491
[wondrous music]

00:40.605 --> 00:42.085
- Such a good boy.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.134
Come on, come on, almost
home, almost home.

00:48.222 --> 00:48.961
Come on.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.621
Come on, treats at home.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.840
What?

00:57.927 --> 00:59.233
Come on.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.237
[tires screeching]
[car speeding]

01:03.324 --> 01:05.152
Come on, what's with you?

01:05.239 --> 01:07.502
[dog whimpering]
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:08.894 --> 01:11.419
[man yells]

01:11.506 --> 01:13.116
[dog barks]

01:13.203 --> 01:16.163
[catchy rock music]

01:24.954 --> 01:28.914
- Okay, okay.

01:29.001 --> 01:30.699
- Watch it, pothole, pothole!

01:30.786 --> 01:32.266
Stop, stop!

01:32.353 --> 01:33.049
- Watch out, watch out,
watch out for the old man,

01:33.136 --> 01:33.963
the old man!

01:34.050 --> 01:35.921
[screaming]

01:36.008 --> 01:38.098
- We must've looked
like the getaway car

01:38.185 --> 01:39.925
after a bank robbery.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.798
But really, it was just my
family getting back on track,

01:42.885 --> 01:44.713
which is all I ever wanted.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.410
But you gotta be careful
what you wish for,

01:46.497 --> 01:48.891
'cause it just might
take the craziest,

01:48.978 --> 01:50.893
most insane way
to get you there.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.200
Maybe even the greatest
adventure of your life.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.421
[lighthearted music]

02:08.737 --> 02:10.956
Echo Harbor was a
great place to be,

02:11.043 --> 02:13.176
and do everything family.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.787
But Main Street fell
apart, literally.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.573
The population aged, and when
kids went away to college,

02:18.660 --> 02:19.922
they never came back.

02:21.489 --> 02:24.579
So, dad rolled up his
sleeves and ran for Mayor.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.320
It was so exciting.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.669
He was gonna make a difference,

02:27.756 --> 02:29.801
and give everybody
hope and reason to stay

02:29.888 --> 02:31.977
in what I once thought
was the best place

02:32.064 --> 02:33.153
in the world to grow up.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.939
And he won!

02:37.026 --> 02:39.420
It felt like a victory
for our whole family.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
Everything that was
wrong in Echo Harbor

02:41.552 --> 02:43.989
would get fixed,
thanks to my dad.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.166
And life would be
even better now.

02:46.253 --> 02:51.171
[lighthearted music]
[clapping]

02:58.265 --> 03:00.571
But the job of being Mayor,

03:00.658 --> 03:04.575
trying to make everyone
happy consumed my dad.

03:04.662 --> 03:05.968
Totally stressed him out,

03:06.055 --> 03:07.970
which then stressed my mom out,

03:08.057 --> 03:09.014
and then even me.

03:10.494 --> 03:14.368
We became like so many
families today, broken.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.110
It really made me sad.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.025
Even sadder than
when my grandma died.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.421
He told me it
wouldn't be forever,

03:24.508 --> 03:27.076
he just had to figure
some things out.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.256
So, dad moved in with grandpa,

03:33.343 --> 03:36.651
which looking back, was probably
a nice thing for grandpa,

03:36.738 --> 03:37.608
because of grandma.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.656
But I was suffering.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.659
Our family was suffering.

03:44.746 --> 03:48.097
And I knew that something
needed to be done.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.882
[dramatic music]

03:54.146 --> 03:57.237
[lighthearted music]

04:08.248 --> 04:13.122
Mom?
[car beeps]

04:13.209 --> 04:15.080
- Mary, Jess is here!

04:15.167 --> 04:16.473
- Gotta go.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.996
- Okay, great.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.563
I will have five dozen
delivered by 6 p.m.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.217
Okay, thanks, Olivia.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.697
Bye.

04:22.784 --> 04:23.524
- Scary.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.525
- What?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.048
It's your senior year picture.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.571
I'm proud.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.051
- Glad to hear it,
because one more college

04:29.138 --> 04:30.095
I won't be going to.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.575
They say I lack life experience.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.405
Is something burning?

04:35.492 --> 04:36.754
- Oh!

04:36.841 --> 04:38.060
Your cake.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.235
- Happy birthday, me.

04:40.802 --> 04:41.585
- Scuffles!

04:42.543 --> 04:45.633
[lighthearted music]

04:55.947 --> 04:57.297
- What are those?

04:57.384 --> 04:59.864
- Two dozen deliciously
cinnamonny scuffles.

04:59.951 --> 05:00.648
- Gotta love your mom.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.475
Feed me.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.434
Happy birthday selfie!

05:04.521 --> 05:05.957
- Oh, oh, I'll take it.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.483
[laughing]

05:09.570 --> 05:11.223
So, I finally convinced my dad

05:11.311 --> 05:12.790
to take me to see
schools in California.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.096
- [Jess] Oh, that's great.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.227
- After the election.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.664
Serial politician.

05:17.752 --> 05:18.883
- Derek just checked you out.

05:18.970 --> 05:19.971
- No, he checked you out.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.016
- No, you!
- Whatever.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.324
- Why can't your
mom just take you?

05:24.411 --> 05:26.195
- Evidently, having
a dad who's a mayor,

05:26.282 --> 05:27.283
even if it's only
of Echo Harbor,

05:27.370 --> 05:28.850
plays well in the room.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.331
Having an amazing mom
with amazing scuffles,

05:31.418 --> 05:32.244
not so much.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.594
[Jess laughs]

05:33.681 --> 05:34.682
- They haven't
tried her scuffles.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.728
Good morning, fellow seniors.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.342
[lighthearted music]

05:43.821 --> 05:45.432
- I thought I was
having a bad day.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.042
- You're not allowed in here.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.045
- Scuffles, anyone?

05:50.915 --> 05:51.525
- Dude.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.354
- Did I mention
it's my birthday?

05:56.399 --> 05:59.228
- Okay, seriously,
what is going on here?

05:59.315 --> 06:01.839
- Under the Stars Senior
Dance, one week from now,

06:01.926 --> 06:03.885
has been relocated from
outside, in the park,

06:03.972 --> 06:05.408
under the stars,

06:05.495 --> 06:06.844
where it's been since
the beginning of time,

06:06.931 --> 06:08.368
to the stinky school gym

06:08.455 --> 06:10.195
I've successfully avoided
for the last four years.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.719
That's what's going
on here, Mary.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.373
- What?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.112
- Do you know how much work
I've been putting into this

06:14.199 --> 06:15.592
for like, eons?

06:15.679 --> 06:16.811
- And I had planned
out this most epic

06:16.898 --> 06:17.899
light projection show.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.509
You see, I figured out this way

06:19.596 --> 06:23.252
to beam up our senior class
message into the cosmos.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.209
Like, a super galactic time-

06:24.296 --> 06:25.733
- Yo, yo, back to earth, Ed.

06:25.820 --> 06:26.560
Come on, bro.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.476
- But it's always in the park.

06:29.563 --> 06:30.259
- The city council-

06:30.346 --> 06:31.826
- And your dad-

06:31.913 --> 06:33.610
- Created some new
ordinance about teens

06:33.697 --> 06:35.525
not allowed to loiter
on Main Street after 10

06:35.612 --> 06:36.526
once summer's over.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.093
- So, goodbye tradition.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.921
- Well, that stinks.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.270
- So, we were thinking-

06:41.357 --> 06:43.359
- Since your dad is the Mayor.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.534
- And it's your birthday.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.057
- No way.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.582
- Just like I told
you, totally useless.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.801
- Guys, come on.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.324
- Just leave.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.415
[melancholic music]

07:03.423 --> 07:04.728
- Hey.

07:04.815 --> 07:05.555
- Hey.

07:13.084 --> 07:13.911
- Just in time.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.393
Hot out of the
oven ginger snaps.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.569
- Sympathy snaps.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.918
- [Mom] Celebration snaps.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.354
- For what?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.400
Failing in almost
every part of my life?

07:24.487 --> 07:26.141
- How about for turning 18?

07:26.228 --> 07:27.534
- Perfect, now I'm legal.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.318
- That wasn't a rejection
letter, you know.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.233
- Rejection letter,
early feedback letter.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.323
Read between the lines,
Mom, I'm useless.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.846
It's a theme.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.327
- Look, either I
break out the violin,

07:38.414 --> 07:39.328
or you talk to me.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.683
- Sorry.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.380
Self indulgent pity party over.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.472
So, daddy still gonna
be there tonight?

07:52.559 --> 07:54.299
- As far as I know.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.998
Why?

07:57.085 --> 08:00.436
- Family meal, all
of us together again.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.657
Should be interesting.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.615
- It's what you wanted.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.357
[dramatic music]

08:15.582 --> 08:16.496
- Hi.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.932
- Okay, are we still waiting?

08:18.019 --> 08:19.890
- Yeah, just give
us a minute, thanks.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.025
I called ahead, I ordered
the seafood tower.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.330
Anybody with me?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.507
- I never turn
down fresh shrimp.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.551
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.075
[clears throat]

08:31.162 --> 08:32.381
- Hey, aren't you the
guy that wrote that book?

08:32.468 --> 08:33.817
- I was, yeah.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.253
- Sorry, we don't
mean to bother you,

08:35.340 --> 08:36.646
but we recognized
you from over there

08:36.733 --> 08:38.082
and just wanted to come
over and say hello.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.606
- Thank you.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.433
- And by the way, I think
you look better bald.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.393
[laughing]

08:44.480 --> 08:45.481
- Sorry about that.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.135
- Must be nice to be famous.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.833
- I was not famous, and
that was a long time ago.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.662
- Speaking of famous,
the Mayor's here.

08:52.749 --> 08:53.968
- [Loren] Late as usual.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.668
- Oh, hey, Smitty, how are ya?

08:58.755 --> 08:59.539
- Hi.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.281
- Juan, I wanted to mention,

09:03.368 --> 09:04.326
we're gonna get right on that.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.588
We're gonna take care of it.

09:05.675 --> 09:06.981
Just some wording.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.592
In fact, we're gonna
get two Tuesday.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.422
Happy birthday, princess!

09:13.509 --> 09:14.510
- Thanks, Dad.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.380
You're sitting there.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.164
- Yep.

09:16.251 --> 09:16.947
Hey, Pops.

09:17.034 --> 09:17.818
- Son.

09:20.516 --> 09:21.430
- Doesn't mom look
great tonight?

09:21.517 --> 09:24.476
- Oh, yes, fantastic as usual.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.087
- You're in a good mood.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.524
- Well, I got some good
news on the election front.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.222
Ben Rogers had a heart attack.

09:32.093 --> 09:32.920
- What?

09:33.007 --> 09:34.356
- Wow, that is great news.

09:34.443 --> 09:35.400
A pillar of the
community nearly died,

09:35.487 --> 09:36.488
let's get champagne.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.533
- What?

09:37.620 --> 09:38.969
Come on, no, he's gonna be fine.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.710
But he is dropping
out of the race, so,

09:40.797 --> 09:43.365
that means I'm basically
running unopposed.

09:43.452 --> 09:44.584
Not that I was worried.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.673
- Of course not.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.152
- You know me so well.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.023
- Too well.

09:50.067 --> 09:50.981
What else?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.330
You're holding something back.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.941
- Nope, it's nothing.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.290
It's Mary's night.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.944
- This is not my night,
this is our night.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.554
The whole family together.

09:58.641 --> 09:59.511
Isn't this great?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.425
- Yeah, it is.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.950
I got your text, by the way,

10:03.037 --> 10:05.430
about the Main Street
Park and the senior dance.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.520
- Oh, yeah, it's a tradition
for the Under the Stars Dance

10:08.608 --> 10:10.435
to be under the stars.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.872
- Yeah, well, good.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.004
- That would be great.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.397
- But I can't.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.442
We implemented that
ordinance for a reason.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.402
To keep downtown safe,
we had complaints.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.533
- Safe from what?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.013
Nobody goes down there anymore.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.275
- 'Cause it's not safe.

10:25.973 --> 10:29.454
But I do have some
other exciting news.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.108
We got the last
investor in place

10:31.195 --> 10:32.501
for the mall in Port Byron,

10:32.588 --> 10:34.372
we break ground in January.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.419
- Well, that's lovely
for Port Byron,

10:37.506 --> 10:40.030
meanwhile, Echo harbor is dying.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.336
- Port Byron's on a freeway.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.293
We don't want a mall here,

10:42.380 --> 10:43.251
it would take over downtown.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.644
But guess what?

10:44.731 --> 10:45.906
We're gonna get
all that overflow.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.603
- Wow, that settles it.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.779
Dad gets his mall,
we get the overflow,

10:49.866 --> 10:53.087
gamps looks better bald, and
mom looks fantastic as usual.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.482
- And you are finally 18.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.136
And you know what that means?

10:59.223 --> 11:00.094
You can vote for me.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.967
- First thing I thought
when I woke up this morning.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.403
- That's my girl.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.840
- Everyone get a chance
to Look at the menus?

11:06.927 --> 11:09.538
- Uh, can you just give
us one more minute?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.627
We're almost, thank
you, thank you.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.324
- Investors are
very happy though.

11:13.411 --> 11:16.371
They're gonna take me on a
trip, golfing in Scotland.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.894
I'll do that after the election.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.375
- Wow.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.116
- Rob, what about your trip
to California with Mary,

11:22.203 --> 11:23.073
looking at schools?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.553
- We'll work something out.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.860
It's golf, but, you
know, it's business.

11:26.947 --> 11:27.948
It never stops.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.558
- No, it doesn't.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.082
- Rob, she's counting on this.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.736
- Mary, I need this, all right?

11:33.823 --> 11:35.477
It's important.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.914
- I need this, it's
also important.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.177
- All right, can we
all just back off here?

11:40.264 --> 11:42.876
- Look, pops, I don't
want any fingers

11:42.963 --> 11:44.181
being pointed here tonight.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.879
I support this
family with things

11:45.966 --> 11:47.402
like my real estate investment,

11:47.489 --> 11:49.578
opening the baking
business, going to college,

11:49.665 --> 11:51.188
those things aren't cheap.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.147
Oh, and by the way, I'm
living with my father.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.844
You know what I mean, Dad.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.541
While you two are
living very comfortably

11:56.628 --> 11:58.021
in a house that I pay for.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.544
- We didn't leave
you, you left us!

11:59.631 --> 12:00.676
- I left you?

12:00.763 --> 12:03.200
- Enough, enough, guys!

12:03.287 --> 12:04.680
- Happy birthday, Mary.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.032
Everybody smile.

12:12.644 --> 12:13.689
[camera shutter snaps]

12:13.776 --> 12:16.518
[somber music]

12:21.697 --> 12:23.525
- I'm sorry about
the trip, princess.

12:23.612 --> 12:24.613
I'll see what I can do.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.093
- It's fine, forget about it.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.095
Can we retire the
whole princess thing?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.574
- You got it.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.577
In the meantime, maybe
this will make up for it.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.102
- What?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.582
- It's yours.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.453
Happy birthday.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.112
- You're giving me
your mid-life crisis?

12:45.199 --> 12:46.591
- Well, I'm done
with it, I thought-

12:46.678 --> 12:48.202
- Like mom, me, us?

12:48.289 --> 12:48.985
Done with it?

12:55.209 --> 12:57.385
- Where did that come from?

12:57.472 --> 12:59.866
[somber music]

13:03.695 --> 13:04.784
- Come on, son.

13:04.871 --> 13:05.654
Let's go home.

13:06.742 --> 13:09.179
[somber music]

13:22.671 --> 13:23.715
- [Mary] I think
everyone should have

13:23.803 --> 13:25.369
a box of disappointments.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.112
A place to put all the
disappointing things of life

13:29.199 --> 13:31.245
so you can just hide them away.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.987
[dramatic music]

13:39.906 --> 13:42.734
Seems like a million years
ago since we were a family.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.483
Although some things are
harder to keep in the box.

14:05.496 --> 14:06.628
- I brought you
some more goodies,

14:06.715 --> 14:08.412
and they're actually still warm.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.632
I so appreciate your
business, Olivia.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.155
- Dirty little secret,

14:12.242 --> 14:13.722
when a customer comes
in to just browse,

14:13.809 --> 14:15.419
they get a cup of coffee

14:15.506 --> 14:17.334
and one of your delicious...

14:17.421 --> 14:19.641
- Scuffles.
- Scuffles.

14:19.728 --> 14:20.772
Then they buy something.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.426
- Wow, glad it helps.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.428
- Maybe now's the
time to tell her

14:24.515 --> 14:27.083
what you put in them that
makes them so powerful?

14:27.170 --> 14:28.258
- Nothing.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.259
Nothing but love.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.000
- And just a wee bit of sugar.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.697
- And spice.
- And everything nice.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.047
- Well, whatever
it is, it works.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.918
[laughing]

14:36.005 --> 14:39.487
So, Mary, are you gonna
follow in the family business?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.793
- Which one, baking or bullying?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.752
That would be my father's job.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.494
- College first,
then she'll decide.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.148
- If she can get
into any college

14:48.235 --> 14:50.933
that will accept her with
her lack of life experiences.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.804
- Oh, to be young again.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.328
Well, for whatever it's worth,

14:54.415 --> 14:56.678
don't change who you
are to impress anyone.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.767
- Only problem, who am I?

14:58.854 --> 15:00.203
[laughing]

15:00.290 --> 15:01.683
- No, I'm serious,
if you can find out

15:01.770 --> 15:04.294
what makes you tick, then
the path will follow.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.469
- Thank you, master.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.732
Can I ask you a question?

15:07.819 --> 15:10.692
Why here, Echo Harbor?

15:10.779 --> 15:12.302
I mean, you've
taken this old place

15:12.389 --> 15:13.869
and turned into
something really cool,

15:13.956 --> 15:16.916
so props for that, but in
case you haven't noticed,

15:17.003 --> 15:20.223
we're kinda nobody anymore,
sort of off the radar.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.007
- Mary!

15:21.094 --> 15:22.182
- No, no, no.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.705
That's very observant.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.664
I had a feeling about you, Mary.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.667
So, going back to
what I just said,

15:31.191 --> 15:33.933
I think I know who I
am, I'm a restorer.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.760
I value history, and
the people and places

15:35.847 --> 15:37.371
that are part of that.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.895
I also see the opportunity
that comes with that.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.115
I like to fix things
up, turn them around.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.117
Create a win-win for everybody.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.988
When I first came here, I
fell in love with Echo Harbor

15:46.075 --> 15:47.424
and this building,

15:47.511 --> 15:48.904
although I suspect both
had seen better days.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.340
- That's being generous.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.777
- But my gut said, "buy
it, give it some love

15:52.864 --> 15:53.822
and a new life."

15:53.909 --> 15:56.477
And voila, here we are.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.783
Wharf Hill, Homewares
and Skiffles.

15:59.959 --> 16:00.524
- Scuffles.
- Scuffles.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.265
- Oh.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.702
- I wish they would do that to
all of Main Street, you know?

16:04.789 --> 16:06.095
Restore it.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.880
It used to be so
beautiful, colorful.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.882
People strolling
in the evenings.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.232
- Well, I'm sure they
would if they could,

16:12.319 --> 16:13.407
but I had a hard enough time

16:13.494 --> 16:15.278
putting this place together.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.801
You guys have enough
rules and laws

16:16.888 --> 16:18.412
to scare anyone off,

16:18.499 --> 16:20.762
and the real deal breaker
for an outside like me

16:20.849 --> 16:23.852
is one buyer, one corporation
per building, per business,

16:23.939 --> 16:25.375
meaning I can't
use my corporation

16:25.462 --> 16:26.768
to buy multiple properties.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.075
And believe me, I would.

16:29.162 --> 16:29.989
Others too.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.817
Yes, I look up and
down Main Street,

16:32.904 --> 16:35.255
and I see so much
potential and opportunity,

16:35.342 --> 16:38.867
but it just doesn't
make financial sense.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.825
- Yep, that would be my dad.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.828
Well, gotta hit it, guys.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.395
I gotta get good old
fashioned life experience

16:45.482 --> 16:46.744
from good old fashioned people.

16:46.831 --> 16:47.789
[chuckling]

16:47.876 --> 16:48.659
See ya.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.930
[lighthearted music]

17:07.548 --> 17:08.810
- Lose your way back, Teddy?

17:08.897 --> 17:10.507
Your room's just
around the corner.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.294
- I tell ya.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.339
Something fishy is
going on around here,

17:16.426 --> 17:18.385
I can smell it.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.083
- That smell is old man
who doesn't bathe enough.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.955
- Amen, hallelujah.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.000
- Deep.

17:25.087 --> 17:25.870
Go Eleanor.

17:25.957 --> 17:26.915
- You watch.

17:27.002 --> 17:27.698
This is big.

17:27.785 --> 17:28.743
It's the big one.

17:30.310 --> 17:34.053
- Speaking of which,
Mary, read your card.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.882
Oh, to be 18 again.

17:37.969 --> 17:41.408
- And all the poor men
you left in your wake.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.974
- "I'm not saying you're old,

17:43.062 --> 17:44.759
I'm just saying
when you were a kid,

17:44.846 --> 17:46.848
emojis were called
hieroglyphics."

17:46.935 --> 17:47.762
[laughing]

17:47.849 --> 17:48.850
It's a good one.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.591
- Franklin picked it out.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.767
He said that you
would understand it.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.639
- Teddy's just mad 'cause he
doesn't know what emojis are.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.554
- Speculation.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.165
Overruled.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.341
- Well, you take the girl
out of the courtroom,

18:01.428 --> 18:04.300
but you can't take the lawyer
out of the little girl.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.955
- Reverend, you ready to check
yourself in here, old man?

18:07.042 --> 18:10.524
- Oh, not quite yet,
Franklin, but gettin' close.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.047
- Pat, you still have
to play by my rules.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.048
- Yeah, I'm just here to-

18:13.135 --> 18:14.223
- What is in the bag?

18:14.310 --> 18:15.137
- Nothing.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.312
- He brought our pudding!

18:16.399 --> 18:18.488
- Do you ever shut up, dummy?

18:18.575 --> 18:19.707
- Hand it over.

18:19.794 --> 18:20.621
- Objection!

18:20.708 --> 18:21.622
- Sustained!

18:22.492 --> 18:23.972
Beat it, Wilma!

18:24.059 --> 18:25.930
- Fine, y'alls want to
go to an early grave?

18:26.017 --> 18:26.975
Have it your way.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.978
- Who knew 80 was the new early?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.501
- Hey, padre.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.938
Would you say a
blessing over Roosevelt?

18:34.025 --> 18:35.505
He hasn't been himself lately,

18:35.592 --> 18:37.333
I'm not suer what's up.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.856
- I'll tell you what's up.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.076
Critters are smarter
than you think.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.166
He knows something
sneaky is going on.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.037
- All right, let's see.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.258
Roosevelt, may we
bless this home

18:49.345 --> 18:51.347
in the name of the
God who created you.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.436
May you and Franklin
continue to live

18:53.523 --> 18:55.221
an abundant life together.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.179
Amen.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.443
Now, here's your pudding.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.271
Shh.

19:08.669 --> 19:09.409
- Thanks, gamps.

19:10.845 --> 19:11.585
- What?

19:12.499 --> 19:13.804
- This.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.242
Family fishing days,
being constant.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.286
- The most important part about

19:17.373 --> 19:18.809
being a family is showing up.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.637
As long as you and
I keep showing up.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.336
You're the glue that
holds the family together,

19:23.423 --> 19:24.163
you know that.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.035
- Not so sure I'm that sticky.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.910
- Your dad, he's
a good man, Mary.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.957
You know, your grandma and I
had him when we were young,

19:36.044 --> 19:37.437
just a couple years
older than you.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.048
We were very young,
and very much in love.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.095
I suppose because of
that, being so young,

19:44.183 --> 19:48.143
he and I became more
friends than father and son.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.494
He was a good friend, and I
know you see some of that.

19:53.453 --> 19:56.195
It may be hard to tell,
but he means well.

19:58.066 --> 20:01.243
- He should've never
have become Mayor.

20:01.330 --> 20:05.856
- Never confuse blindness
with badness, or baldness.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.858
[chuckling]

20:09.295 --> 20:11.210
We can all lose the
plot from time to time.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.036
- Even you?

20:13.037 --> 20:14.038
- Oh yeah.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.084
Even me.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.525
Can I share something with you?

20:22.612 --> 20:23.352
- Of course.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.227
- I've got this
sermon on forgiveness.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.230
I've been meaning to give it
for a year full of Sundays.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.667
It's about me.

20:33.754 --> 20:34.363
- Why haven't you?

20:35.843 --> 20:39.586
- Well, every time I
get to it, every Sunday,

20:39.673 --> 20:41.936
I look out at my
congregation, all of you,

20:42.023 --> 20:45.983
and I just chicken out,

20:46.070 --> 20:48.334
go to one of my old standards.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.379
- That doesn't sound like you.

20:50.466 --> 20:51.206
- No.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.775
I tell you what.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.951
You continue to inspire
me, and this Sunday,

20:57.038 --> 20:59.127
this Sunday I'm gonna do it!

20:59.214 --> 21:00.781
You see, you be ready.

21:00.868 --> 21:01.608
- I'll be ready.

21:02.739 --> 21:03.479
- Hey, Mary.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.395
Mr. Parson.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.223
- Oh, hey, Jordan!

21:09.703 --> 21:10.747
- Hey, Jordan.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.227
What's up?

21:12.314 --> 21:14.316
[whimsical music]

21:14.403 --> 21:14.838
- Uh...

21:16.405 --> 21:19.800
Well, Mary, you know
the dance is tonight,

21:20.801 --> 21:24.283
and um, I'm going alone,

21:26.023 --> 21:29.244
and I knew everybody was
gonna be excited to see you,

21:30.898 --> 21:35.294
so I was wondering would
you go to the dance with me?

21:36.860 --> 21:39.341
- I already have plans
with my grandpa, sorry.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.217
- Yeah.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.131
Yeah, that's fine.

21:49.743 --> 21:53.486
I just wanted you to know
that you're gonna be missed.

21:54.443 --> 21:55.705
- Thank you.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.707
Have fun, tell
everyone I said hi.

21:57.794 --> 21:58.491
- I will.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.494
See ya, Mr. Parson.

22:01.581 --> 22:02.321
- See ya around.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.281
[whimsical music]

22:08.327 --> 22:09.850
Seems like a cool dude.

22:09.937 --> 22:10.720
- Grandpa.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.157
- I'm just saying the obvious.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.116
Why don't you want to go
to the dance with him?

22:15.203 --> 22:16.639
- First of all, "cool dude"?

22:16.726 --> 22:18.162
- Well, you say that
all the time, dude.

22:18.249 --> 22:18.859
- But you're old.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.688
Second of all, it's
a school dance,

22:21.775 --> 22:23.733
third of all, I don't dance.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.082
- Oh, yeah?

22:25.169 --> 22:26.736
We'll see about that.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.870
[lighthearted music]

22:39.967 --> 22:42.709
- I bet this isn't how you
envisioned your senior dance.

22:42.796 --> 22:43.884
- No, it isn't.

22:43.971 --> 22:44.841
Thanks, Grandpa?

22:46.365 --> 22:49.019
- You know, my James was
quite the twinkle-toes

22:49.106 --> 22:50.369
back in the day.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.371
- Well, you're no
slouch yourself.

22:52.458 --> 22:57.376
[laughing]
[lighthearted music]

22:59.073 --> 22:59.856
- May I cut in?

22:59.943 --> 23:00.553
- Yeah, sure.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.993
- Pastor, have you
heard the news?

23:07.124 --> 23:08.909
They're shutting the place down.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.476
[clapping]

23:10.563 --> 23:12.478
- Let's start thinking
about bedtime, kids.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.308
- What do you mean
they're shutting it down?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.309
- Take a look.

23:21.312 --> 23:24.490
- GSA, it's the eviction
of demolition notice.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.187
The building's being condemned.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.971
- They're saying it
doesn't meet code.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.410
And if it can't be fixed,
boom, down it goes!

23:31.497 --> 23:33.194
- They're not gonna
tear this place down,

23:33.281 --> 23:34.935
it's the site of the
first animal hospital

23:35.022 --> 23:36.502
south of New York.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.243
- You've been telling
us that for 20 years.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.506
- This is our home!

23:42.116 --> 23:43.857
- It's not just here,
most of Main Street

23:43.944 --> 23:45.424
is being condemned.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.816
- Yeah, half these buildings
are already closed down,

23:46.903 --> 23:48.557
the other folks are just
struggling to survive.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.298
- Smithfield Ice
Cream is on there,

23:50.385 --> 23:52.387
they're gonna take
our ice cream!

23:52.474 --> 23:53.519
- Is this legal?

23:53.606 --> 23:54.911
- Give me that!

23:54.998 --> 23:57.610
[dramatic music]

24:02.049 --> 24:03.572
I'm afraid that it is.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.489
It looks like they have
everything they need.

24:07.576 --> 24:10.274
[dramatic music]

24:29.598 --> 24:32.296
- We're losing the senior home?

24:32.383 --> 24:34.168
- This is not a
good time, princess.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.909
Mary, sorry.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.432
I have a press conference.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.825
And yes, someone has
reported half the town

24:38.912 --> 24:40.304
on code violations,

24:40.391 --> 24:42.306
and a handful of other
problems, I know.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.178
- Okay, so what are
you gonna do about it?

24:44.265 --> 24:45.701
- Nothing, it's out of my hands.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.442
- Lately everything seems
to be out of your hands.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.922
- Please, don't start.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.750
And by the way, it might
not be such a bad thing.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.534
- Might not be such a bad thing?

24:52.621 --> 24:54.449
Half of Main Street is on there!

24:54.536 --> 24:57.234
- Which has been dying
a slow death for years,

24:57.321 --> 24:59.454
long before I took over.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.847
- What about
Sunnyside, my friends?

25:00.934 --> 25:02.283
They're on the list.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.067
It's the government's
job to help the people.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.373
- Look, if a business
can't make it,

25:05.460 --> 25:06.896
maybe it shouldn't
be a business.

25:06.983 --> 25:08.419
- We should step
in and help them.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.899
Especially 80 year
olds who have spent

25:09.986 --> 25:11.727
their entire lives
here contributing.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.381
- Okay, fine, and
while we're at it,

25:13.468 --> 25:15.252
why don't we just
bring Blockbuster back,

25:15.339 --> 25:16.689
and we'll make a law that says

25:16.776 --> 25:18.952
everyone has to watch
movies again on videotape.

25:19.039 --> 25:19.953
[laughing]

25:20.040 --> 25:21.084
- What's Blockbuster?

25:23.913 --> 25:25.219
[Rob sighs]

25:25.306 --> 25:28.004
- Mary, we cannot solve
everyone's problems.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.440
- Do you even hear yourself?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.530
So while you're busy
building along Port Byron,

25:31.617 --> 25:34.097
our own Main Street doesn't
actually get the overflow,

25:34.184 --> 25:35.664
it gets ripped down?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.231
It doesn't take a conspiracy nut

25:37.318 --> 25:38.972
to smell something
fishy going on here.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.190
- Conspiracy?

25:40.277 --> 25:41.061
- Dad!

25:41.148 --> 25:41.888
- Okay, all right.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.280
Hold on a second.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.325
Where is it?

25:44.412 --> 25:45.195
Here you go.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.371
Uh, take a look at this.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.723
This is Main Street.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.768
- Yeah, I know, I've
lived here for 18 years.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.640
- Okay, well half the
stores are closed.

25:54.727 --> 25:55.292
- Way too many.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.729
- Yes.

25:56.816 --> 25:57.773
And the other half
need serious repairs

25:57.860 --> 25:59.209
just to get up to code.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.515
You know who they're
gonna come to for that?

26:00.602 --> 26:01.385
Me.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.387
- Then do it, help them!

26:03.474 --> 26:05.085
- I have run the
numbers, princess,

26:05.172 --> 26:06.565
it doesn't make sense.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.523
- Okay, what about that law?

26:08.610 --> 26:10.569
About how many businesses
a corporation can buy.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.222
- What do you know about that?

26:12.309 --> 26:14.485
- I know that Olivia Wharf-Hill
bought up that old shop,

26:14.573 --> 26:15.965
and I know that people like her,

26:16.052 --> 26:18.141
people with corporations
might be interested

26:18.228 --> 26:19.447
in buying a whole lot more

26:19.534 --> 26:21.362
if that stupid ordinance
wasn't in place-

26:21.449 --> 26:22.842
- The stupid ordinance
is to prevent

26:22.929 --> 26:24.583
a mega-company from coming in,

26:24.670 --> 26:26.497
imploding downtown
and destroying it.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.587
- Right, that's your job.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.763
- I'm not the bad
guy here, okay?

26:30.850 --> 26:32.460
- That's exclusive
to our family.

26:32.547 --> 26:36.029
- Okay, I don't expect
a high school kid

26:36.116 --> 26:38.205
who needs her daddy running
off to California with her

26:38.292 --> 26:39.772
so she can finally get
accepted to college

26:39.859 --> 26:42.078
to understand any of this.

26:43.514 --> 26:44.559
- Wow.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.344
- I'm sorry.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.390
- So many parts of
that were messed up.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.826
- Yes, that came out wrong.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.395
- No, that's the most
true thing you ever said.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.094
Just so we're clear,
you think I'm too young,

26:58.181 --> 27:00.531
and I guess too dumb to
care about my hometown?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.316
- No, that's not what I said.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.926
- You're the Mayor.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.101
You can do something about this.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.494
And while you're at it,

27:06.581 --> 27:09.323
give us kids our
park back, it's safe!

27:09.410 --> 27:10.977
- I am the Mayor,
and guess what?

27:11.064 --> 27:13.022
I'm gonna be Mayor
for the next 4 years,

27:13.109 --> 27:14.676
so what I say goes.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.591
Now, I think we're done here.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.246
[intense music]

27:24.512 --> 27:25.905
- I had to either walk out,

27:25.992 --> 27:27.950
or go nuclear on him.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.735
He lost sight of everything

27:29.822 --> 27:31.432
that once made me
so proud of him,

27:31.519 --> 27:34.261
family and the town
he promised to fix.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.305
You know what?

27:35.392 --> 27:37.133
I'm running for Mayor!

27:37.220 --> 27:39.875
[dramatic music]

27:45.054 --> 27:48.492
[camera shutters snapping]

27:52.105 --> 27:53.584
- That's not gonna
happen overnight,

27:53.672 --> 27:54.760
getting my five point
plan into place-

27:54.847 --> 27:55.674
- You know what?

27:55.761 --> 27:56.544
I'm running for Mayor!

27:57.632 --> 27:59.242
I'm not running for Mayor,

27:59.329 --> 28:00.330
so you don't have to worry.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.770
I don't know, I was
just so angry with him.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.119
He keeps ignoring everything.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.598
Sunnyside Senior
Home, Main Street,

28:07.686 --> 28:09.557
Seniors Under the Stars Dance.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.515
And he's being a
bully about it too.

28:11.602 --> 28:12.778
- So, you wanted to hurt him.

28:12.865 --> 28:13.604
- No!

28:15.171 --> 28:17.304
Yeah, maybe a little.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.871
- That was wrong.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.568
- I know it was, but then
I left there and thought

28:20.655 --> 28:22.178
maybe I can actually do
something around here,

28:22.265 --> 28:23.745
make a difference, why not?

28:23.832 --> 28:26.574
It's better than him doing
nothing at all, right?

28:26.661 --> 28:27.357
- Okay.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.838
- But that's absurd.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.449
I can't even get into a decent
college without his help.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.060
I'll just apologize, fix it,

28:34.147 --> 28:35.017
make it all go away.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.542
Wow, now I'm starting
to sound like him.

28:41.589 --> 28:44.070
[cell phone ringing]

28:44.157 --> 28:46.028
It's Jess, needs me at school.

28:47.595 --> 28:51.381
[lighthearted music]

28:51.468 --> 28:52.818
- About time!

28:52.905 --> 28:54.341
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

28:54.428 --> 28:55.734
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.214
Okay, sign here,
and here, and here.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.563
- What am I signing?

28:59.650 --> 29:00.303
- Papers, to get
you on the ballot.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.783
- Wait, what?

29:01.870 --> 29:02.784
- We heard your announcement,
it was brilliant.

29:02.871 --> 29:04.177
- But I didn't even know-

29:04.264 --> 29:05.569
- Okay, so we missed
some deadlines,

29:05.656 --> 29:06.570
so we have some hoops
to jump through,

29:06.657 --> 29:07.789
but we can make it.

29:07.876 --> 29:08.703
- "We"?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.096
- I talked to Mr. Fordham.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.532
Anyone participating
in your campaign

29:11.619 --> 29:14.578
doesn't have to take the
social studies final.

29:14.665 --> 29:15.536
You're my hero.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.320
- But I didn't even-

29:17.407 --> 29:18.626
- You're right, you're not.

29:18.713 --> 29:19.105
This is a complete
waste of time.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.541
- Annie!

29:20.628 --> 29:21.934
- Mary, come on,
you're not your dad.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.327
- No, she's right,
this is a mistake.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.720
- There are no mistakes.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.461
- Guys, my dad
pushed my buttons,

29:27.548 --> 29:29.158
ruined my family,
so I pushed back.

29:30.638 --> 29:31.900
- I think you'd
make a great mayor.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.336
- No, I'm 18.

29:34.642 --> 29:35.686
Wait, really?

29:35.774 --> 29:36.775
- Awesome.

29:38.298 --> 29:39.299
- Dumb.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.126
- She's right.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.562
Guys, let's be real.

29:41.649 --> 29:42.389
If no one can think
of a better idea

29:42.476 --> 29:43.564
than get back at my dad,

29:43.651 --> 29:44.565
then this conversation is over.

29:44.652 --> 29:45.827
- No social studies final.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.002
- Better than that.

29:47.089 --> 29:47.960
- Little help, bro?

29:49.962 --> 29:51.441
[grunting]

29:51.528 --> 29:53.356
- Hey, where is everybody?

29:53.443 --> 29:56.229
[whimsical music]

29:59.754 --> 30:01.103
- High schooler runs for mayor

30:02.713 --> 30:04.803
could look great on
a college application

30:04.890 --> 30:06.195
for anyone involved.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.459
What?

30:09.546 --> 30:10.983
People can't change their minds?

30:13.202 --> 30:15.683
- I mean, talk about
a life experience.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.119
- How many high
school seniors can say

30:17.206 --> 30:19.426
they've ran an official
political campaign?

30:19.513 --> 30:20.993
- And think about it, you win,

30:21.080 --> 30:23.212
you could really make a
difference, change things up.

30:23.299 --> 30:24.257
- Get our park back.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.130
- Help Sunnyside Senior Home.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.698
- And of course, show
your dad who's boss.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.047
- Okay, keep talking.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.614
- Great, town
council meets today.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.746
- You missed the regular
deadline to enter the race.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.617
- You're gonna have to
speak to the council

30:36.704 --> 30:38.010
to get an exception.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.751
- Speak?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.623
Like, in front of people?

30:42.710 --> 30:43.972
- It's a part of
the job description.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.539
- I've got you on the agenda.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.324
- Speak about what?

30:48.411 --> 30:50.761
- Okay, there's like 5 minutes
of my life missing here,

30:50.849 --> 30:52.502
can someone please
fill in the blanks?

30:52.589 --> 30:53.634
- And we're off!

30:53.721 --> 30:56.811
[lighthearted music]

31:03.513 --> 31:05.689
- And that is why we think
you should grant our petition

31:05.776 --> 31:08.127
to put Mary Parson
on the ballot.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.868
Just remember, "Yes for Mary!"

31:09.955 --> 31:11.739
The acronym Y-E-S.

31:11.826 --> 31:13.741
Y is for youth, E for educated,

31:13.828 --> 31:16.309
and S for she is a female.

31:16.396 --> 31:17.179
Yes for Mary.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.093
- Well said.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.312
Thank you, Miss Duffy.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.226
- Thank you.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.749
- Look, enough, okay?

31:23.229 --> 31:25.622
On behalf of my family
and I, we're very sorry.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.842
This is obviously a very
private family matter

31:27.929 --> 31:30.410
that should be resolved
at home, and not here.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.281
I apologize for
wasting everyone's time

31:32.368 --> 31:34.588
with this little fiasco.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.895
- Excuse me, but what about this

31:36.982 --> 31:39.506
makes you think it's
a fiasco, Mr. Mayor?

31:39.593 --> 31:41.073
- Well, Mary's a young girl,

31:41.160 --> 31:43.118
she obviously
can't run the town-

31:43.205 --> 31:45.033
- Just a young girl?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.687
Joan of Arc was
just a young girl

31:46.774 --> 31:48.558
when she led her
troops to victory.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.169
Cleopatra was just a young girl

31:50.256 --> 31:52.562
when she toppled the two
leaders of the Roman Empire.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.348
Queen Elizabeth I was
just a young girl.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.436
- Okay.

31:56.523 --> 31:57.785
- Your daughter's a young woman,

31:57.872 --> 31:59.395
with more ideas in
her little pinky

31:59.482 --> 32:02.094
than you have in that pea
head you call a brain!

32:02.181 --> 32:02.921
- Ma'am.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.358
- Just, we got it.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.359
- You told 'em, you told 'em,

32:06.446 --> 32:07.926
we got it, we'll handle this.

32:08.013 --> 32:11.451
- All right, so we would
like to speak in opposition

32:11.538 --> 32:13.366
to allowing Mary
to run for mayor.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.846
- Finally, the voices of reason.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.719
- As you know, some of
the most notorious leaders

32:18.806 --> 32:20.721
in all of history
got their top jobs

32:20.808 --> 32:22.462
without being voted in.

32:22.549 --> 32:25.552
- Well, I am being voted
in, just unopposed.

32:25.639 --> 32:26.509
- Exactly.

32:26.596 --> 32:27.815
Unopposed.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.773
Like Stalin and Attila the Hun.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.644
- And Kim Jong-Un.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.039
Yeah, no debate is complete
without bringing up

32:34.126 --> 32:35.649
that nasty little dude

32:35.736 --> 32:38.173
with the funny looking soul
patch on his upper lip.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.696
Am I right, guys?
- Good one, bro.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.872
[laughing]

32:45.354 --> 32:46.834
- Okay.

32:46.921 --> 32:49.880
Princess, do you have
anything you'd like to say,

32:49.968 --> 32:51.752
or have you been spoken for?

32:53.275 --> 32:54.494
- I can't do this.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.365
- Yes, you can.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.280
Just read what's on the cards.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.282
I got an A on my essay
using those notes.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.069
- Just speak from your heart.

33:05.505 --> 33:06.506
- Miss Parson?

33:21.738 --> 33:24.219
- Members of the council.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.874
America is known as the
great democratic experiment.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.791
The principles set forth
by the founding fathers-

33:30.878 --> 33:33.881
- Mary, this isn't the
battle for the White House.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.275
Just tell us why you think

33:36.362 --> 33:38.059
we should allow you
to run for mayor.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.019
- [Jess] Mary, hey!

33:41.106 --> 33:42.194
You've got this, girl.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.115
- Will and Ed are right.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.814
A true election is about choice.

33:53.901 --> 33:57.296
And right now it's just
same old, same old.

33:57.383 --> 33:59.124
I meet the requirements,
the checklist.

34:00.473 --> 34:01.343
The one thing that
isn't on there

34:01.430 --> 34:02.823
that I can't just check off

34:02.910 --> 34:04.259
is that I actually
care about this town.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.175
It's like an extended
family to me,

34:07.262 --> 34:09.438
and like family, it deserves
to be given a chance

34:09.525 --> 34:11.527
to be brought back, restored.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.488
We have to actually
listen to each other,

34:15.575 --> 34:19.361
and understand what each
of us needs, young and old.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.148
A future informed
by our history.

34:24.845 --> 34:28.327
Because we're all a part of
this town, we all matter.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.024
Echo Harbor is our home.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.028
For better or for
worse, a family.

34:34.115 --> 34:37.075
[dramatic music]

34:38.554 --> 34:40.643
At least, that's what I think.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.169
[clapping]

34:48.303 --> 34:50.958
[dramatic music]

35:05.103 --> 35:07.453
- Well, looks like we have
ourselves a race for mayor.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.892
Not awkward for me, in
that I have two horses

35:11.979 --> 35:13.937
in this two horse race.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.114
[laughing]

35:17.985 --> 35:20.901
In politics, we tend
to find ourselves

35:20.988 --> 35:22.990
up against each other, divided.

35:24.731 --> 35:27.516
And in doing so, I think we
lose sight of certain things.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.911
So, today, I'd like to
talk about something

35:30.998 --> 35:32.347
that affects us all,

35:32.434 --> 35:36.743
something without we can
find ourselves alone,

35:38.310 --> 35:42.749
disconnected from one
another, certainly from God.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.537
Today I would like
to talk about f...

35:51.671 --> 35:52.454
For...

35:58.982 --> 35:59.766
Fellowship.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.161
Fellowship.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.074
Oh, thank you, thank you.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.467
Good to see you.

36:05.554 --> 36:07.077
Hey, so good to
see you, thank you.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.994
- Wow, sure learned a lot
about for, for, fellowship.

36:11.081 --> 36:14.302
- Oh, hey, thank you, thank you.

36:16.043 --> 36:19.177
Mary, you're gonna have to
talk to him sooner than later.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.570
Thanksgiving,
Christmas, my funeral.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.093
- Hey, pops.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.443
Sermon kind of wandered a
little today, didn't it?

36:24.530 --> 36:25.444
- Oh, not you.

36:25.531 --> 36:26.140
- [Rob] For, for, for, for...

36:26.227 --> 36:27.837
- Rob, I get it.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.404
- Mary.

36:29.491 --> 36:32.364
Sorry if I was out of line
at the council meeting.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.975
Honestly, I did not
mean to insult you.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.411
- It's fine.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.326
- [Rob] But can I
ask you a question?

36:38.413 --> 36:39.980
- Sure.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.156
- Do you really
want to be mayor?

36:42.243 --> 36:43.679
- I guess, yeah.

36:43.766 --> 36:44.550
- Well, why?

36:44.637 --> 36:46.247
I mean, what is it?

36:46.334 --> 36:48.728
Civic duty, make a difference,
you want to get back at me?

36:48.815 --> 36:49.424
Whatever it is-

36:49.511 --> 36:51.034
- Son-

36:51.121 --> 36:52.166
- No, whatever it is, I
think you're gonna have to do

36:52.253 --> 36:52.949
a little better than "I guess".

36:53.036 --> 36:54.516
Okay?

36:54.603 --> 36:55.735
And you're gonna have to
take a hard look around here

36:55.822 --> 36:57.215
at the good and the bad

36:57.302 --> 36:58.694
and figure out what makes
this place so special

36:58.781 --> 37:00.174
that you want to
fight so hard for,

37:00.261 --> 37:01.741
that you want to
fight me for it.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.917
- You can smart with
Smitty's Ice Cream Parlor.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.180
All those Saturdays we
spent there together?

37:06.267 --> 37:07.442
- Yes, yes we did.

37:07.529 --> 37:09.227
- And Sunnyside Senior Home.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.054
If that goes away, they
won't have any place to live.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.752
- We will find
places for everyone-

37:12.839 --> 37:14.014
- Scattered across the country.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.755
- There is a workable solution.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.539
- And what about the
rest of downtown?

37:17.626 --> 37:18.932
- Yes, all right?

37:19.019 --> 37:20.368
Yes.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.196
Echo Harbor's broken,
but guess what?

37:22.283 --> 37:23.328
- No, please, come on.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.546
- Dad, guess what?

37:24.633 --> 37:26.026
It's not lost on me.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.202
I take the job of
being mayor seriously.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.596
- Then do your job and
help the people seriously!

37:30.683 --> 37:32.032
- All right, guys, seriously.

37:32.119 --> 37:32.685
I'm...

37:32.772 --> 37:34.164
Please.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.254
- You know, Mary,
you have a big heart.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.081
That's one of the
things I love about you.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.127
We can't save everyone.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.870
But we can forgive.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.481
We can forgive.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.049
I don't fault you
for this silly idea

37:49.136 --> 37:50.224
that you're somehow
gonna run against me

37:50.311 --> 37:51.965
and make everything better,

37:52.052 --> 37:53.488
but I do forgive you,

37:53.575 --> 37:55.751
for making me look
foolish in the process.

37:58.841 --> 37:59.799
See?

37:59.886 --> 38:00.843
Walk away.

38:00.930 --> 38:01.844
- Shh.

38:01.931 --> 38:02.715
Just shh.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.067
Okay, I can't.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.331
[dramatic music]

38:10.418 --> 38:12.202
Hi, everybody.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.901
Steve, welcome home,
congratulations.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.424
- What?

38:16.511 --> 38:19.253
[catchy music]

38:28.044 --> 38:28.828
- No.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.048
We can do better.

38:32.135 --> 38:32.962
We can do better.

38:34.442 --> 38:35.661
Now we just have to
see who's with us.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.010
- And who's against us!

38:37.097 --> 38:38.446
- Not quite.

38:38.533 --> 38:39.360
We just want to see who
else wants to help us

38:39.447 --> 38:40.230
save Echo Harbor.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.275
- And who doesn't.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.539
- So, "We can do better."

38:44.626 --> 38:45.845
Is that like our slogan?

38:48.238 --> 38:49.805
- A slogan, you know,
it's like a saying.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.111
- I know what a slogan is.

38:51.198 --> 38:51.981
Thanks, Ed.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.245
Sure.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.899
"We can do better."

38:56.986 --> 38:57.726
Jess?

38:57.813 --> 38:58.684
- Works for me.

38:58.771 --> 39:00.250
- [Mary] Jordan?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.164
- Absolutely.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.209
- [Mary] Annie?

39:02.296 --> 39:03.079
- Game on.

39:06.996 --> 39:07.780
- That's a start.

39:08.955 --> 39:12.045
[lighthearted music]

39:20.270 --> 39:21.359
Thank you guys.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.102
- But isn't she the
Mayor's daughter?

39:26.189 --> 39:27.321
- She is.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.757
Guilty, Mrs. Shanahan.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.934
- Oh, my.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.328
This is all very odd.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.942
- Speaking of odd,
I so hate my face.

39:40.029 --> 39:40.813
- Try smiling.

39:43.598 --> 39:44.860
- Mary?

39:44.947 --> 39:45.687
You got a minute?

39:46.775 --> 39:47.472
- Hey, Rhonda.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.648
What's up?

39:49.735 --> 39:50.649
- Town council sent me
to get your platform

39:50.736 --> 39:51.824
for the election website.

39:51.911 --> 39:53.260
- Oh, like on camera?

39:53.347 --> 39:54.522
- Your dad's is.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.829
- Mary, smile.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.309
- A bake sale fundraiser.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.833
That's a first.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.312
- Yeah, that's what
happens when your mom

40:02.400 --> 40:03.923
is the best baker
this side of Brooklyn.

40:04.010 --> 40:05.272
- You know the
average campaign costs

40:05.359 --> 40:07.056
about $50,000.

40:07.143 --> 40:09.058
That's a lot of cookies.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.625
- We'll do that
in scuffles alone.

40:10.712 --> 40:13.236
Now ask her something
serious or get lost!

40:13.323 --> 40:16.152
- No, seriously, this
topic is totally fine.

40:16.239 --> 40:17.719
Thank you, though.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.417
- Okay.

40:19.504 --> 40:23.116
Initiative 143 comes before
the town council next month.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.291
What's your stance?

40:25.945 --> 40:28.600
- We're not up to speed
yet, what is that again?

40:28.687 --> 40:31.385
- Reallocation of funds
from the boardwalk repair

40:31.472 --> 40:33.692
to upgrade the computer
system at the high school.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.345
- I would vote yes.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.260
The high school mainframe
is like 80's technology,

40:37.347 --> 40:38.871
there's no security wall at all.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.527
Not like I know
anyone who deleted

40:42.614 --> 40:44.398
a couple of absent days.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.618
- [Will] Are you like
completely oblivious, bro?

40:50.056 --> 40:51.492
- What's my dad doing?

40:51.579 --> 40:54.364
- The Mayor is suggesting
we focus on the school,

40:54.452 --> 40:56.236
for obvious reasons,

40:56.323 --> 40:58.194
and tackle the
boardwalk next spring

40:58.281 --> 40:59.369
before the summer rush.

41:00.501 --> 41:01.633
- Sounds about right.

41:01.720 --> 41:02.721
- Mary?

41:02.808 --> 41:04.287
- Oh!

41:04.374 --> 41:07.943
That was Mary Parson,
running for Mayor.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.336
Literally.

41:09.423 --> 41:12.208
[whimsical music]

41:17.344 --> 41:18.780
- Well, why don't
we go on upstairs?

41:18.867 --> 41:20.216
We'll get to the details,

41:20.303 --> 41:21.870
there will be plenty
of time for that.

41:21.957 --> 41:24.699
[whimsical music]

41:29.487 --> 41:30.357
Come on in.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.190
- 52 dollars, 86 cents.

41:39.322 --> 41:40.759
- 86 cents?

41:40.846 --> 41:42.717
- Mr. Fergus said
he liked our shirts.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.024
- 86 cents?

41:47.983 --> 41:49.507
I just need to find my focus.

41:50.986 --> 41:51.944
Can you please turn that off?

41:52.031 --> 41:53.772
My voice is so nasally.

41:53.859 --> 41:54.773
- It's not that bad.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.515
- I endorsed my dad's position,

41:57.602 --> 41:59.734
I run away from an interview.

41:59.821 --> 42:00.518
Not that bad?

42:01.606 --> 42:03.085
- I just meant your voice.

42:03.172 --> 42:05.218
- The good news is,
you're up in the polls.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.002
You were at 1%, now you're at 2.

42:07.089 --> 42:08.134
- Woo hoo!

42:08.221 --> 42:09.657
- Found him.
- Found him.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.181
His name's Perry Stevens,
inspector with the GSA.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.662
- The agency that put notice

42:14.749 --> 42:16.272
to all the buildings downtown?

42:16.359 --> 42:17.752
- Why was he talking to him?

42:17.839 --> 42:19.101
- 'Cause he's the rat
who ratted him out

42:19.188 --> 42:20.538
to the GSA in the first place.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.583
- Maybe he was meeting
for something different.

42:22.670 --> 42:25.978
- Dark and sinister,
back alleys, rain
covered cobblestones,

42:26.065 --> 42:27.066
figures lurking in the sha-

42:27.153 --> 42:27.936
- Dude.

42:29.285 --> 42:30.199
Or, maybe your dad's right.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.420
52 bucks doesn't
show a ton of support

42:33.507 --> 42:34.856
that downtown can
sustain itself.

42:34.943 --> 42:36.292
- So, what?

42:36.379 --> 42:38.468
Do we just let it
shrivel up and die?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.165
- I'm not saying that.

42:40.645 --> 42:41.646
I'm just saying who
thinks Main Street

42:41.733 --> 42:42.951
is important anymore?

42:44.910 --> 42:45.650
- Disney.

42:47.521 --> 42:49.654
There's a reason that Walt
Disney made Main Street

42:49.741 --> 42:52.526
the first thing you see when
you walk into his parks.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.963
It's the heart, everything
goes out from there.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.487
- I never thought about that.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.402
- When you walk into
Disneyland, you feel safe.

42:59.489 --> 43:02.884
You feel welcomed, loved,
like you're at home.

43:02.971 --> 43:04.364
- Main Street.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.366
- Main Street isn't just
a place for businesses,

43:06.453 --> 43:08.673
it's a representation
of who we are

43:08.760 --> 43:10.457
and what we stand for.

43:10.544 --> 43:11.806
Believe it or not, my
dad actually told me

43:11.893 --> 43:13.329
to think about the town

43:13.416 --> 43:14.592
and why it's so important to me.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.856
And now I think it's
time the Mayor's office

43:17.943 --> 43:19.379
thinks about that too.

43:19.466 --> 43:20.815
There's two kinds of people.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.469
Those who want to
tear everything down,

43:22.556 --> 43:24.253
and those who want
to restore it.

43:24.340 --> 43:27.822
So now we have to
decide, who are we?

43:27.909 --> 43:28.823
- Main Street.

43:28.910 --> 43:30.042
- Main Street.

43:30.129 --> 43:32.131
- Main Street.
- Main Street.

43:32.218 --> 43:35.308
[lighthearted music]

43:54.936 --> 43:56.895
- The old music store.

43:56.982 --> 43:58.461
- Mr. Kostreva.

43:58.548 --> 44:00.986
- Bought my first and
last guitar in there.

44:01.987 --> 44:03.031
Fat fingers.

44:03.118 --> 44:04.685
- Me too.

44:04.772 --> 44:07.949
- Broke Mr. Singer's heart
when he had to close her up.

44:08.036 --> 44:09.908
- You think at least
music would survive.

44:09.995 --> 44:12.432
- Yet somehow, there's purpose.

44:12.519 --> 44:13.955
You just gotta find it.

44:14.042 --> 44:16.305
Nothing's worthwhile that
comes without a struggle.

44:16.392 --> 44:20.353
It's how we deal with those
obstacles that define us.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.268
- You and your family
have been in here,

44:22.355 --> 44:23.748
Echo Harbor-

44:23.835 --> 44:26.620
- God created the
Earth, Echo Harbor,

44:26.707 --> 44:28.491
and my family's hardware store.

44:28.578 --> 44:31.930
- Right, so, what is it?

44:32.017 --> 44:33.583
What makes everyone stay?

44:33.671 --> 44:34.976
- Why is it so special?

44:35.063 --> 44:35.803
- Exactly.

44:37.370 --> 44:38.632
- How about I walk you home?

44:43.289 --> 44:45.204
You know all those
storms we had last year?

44:45.291 --> 44:46.684
- Yeah.

44:46.771 --> 44:49.121
- Now after that,
just about packed up

44:49.208 --> 44:51.036
and got out of here.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.515
- Why?

44:52.602 --> 44:55.823
- Well, I kind of realized
that, looking around,

44:55.910 --> 44:57.564
this place was our whole world.

44:58.652 --> 45:00.175
- Hey, Mom!

45:00.262 --> 45:02.700
I had the worst day ever
and then the best day ever.

45:03.483 --> 45:04.832
Wow.

45:04.919 --> 45:06.965
Whole family's here,
looking like Mt. Rushmore.

45:10.795 --> 45:12.884
Is this like, an
intervention or something?

45:12.971 --> 45:13.928
'Cause I don't drink,
and I don't do drugs.

45:14.015 --> 45:15.582
- Mary, we need to talk.

45:15.669 --> 45:16.931
Push an end to this.

45:17.018 --> 45:18.324
- I'm just getting started.

45:18.411 --> 45:20.021
- Mary, he comes in peace.

45:20.108 --> 45:21.457
- Just listen.

45:21.544 --> 45:22.415
- I don't like the
way we left things,

45:22.502 --> 45:23.372
and it's been eating me up.

45:23.459 --> 45:25.331
- Losing sleep, I'm sure.

45:25.418 --> 45:27.376
By the way, I'm on to you.

45:27.463 --> 45:28.508
- What's that supposed to mean?

45:28.595 --> 45:29.378
- Nothing, go on.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.338
- I don't want to
make you mad, ever,

45:32.425 --> 45:33.339
I really don't.

45:33.426 --> 45:34.688
- Debatable.

45:34.775 --> 45:35.776
- And I don't want
to see you hurt.

45:35.863 --> 45:36.951
- A little late for that.

45:37.038 --> 45:38.431
- Mary, stop.

45:40.650 --> 45:41.913
- Look, we all know
that you're running

45:42.000 --> 45:43.915
just to get back at
me, and I get it, I do-

45:44.002 --> 45:44.872
- No!

45:44.959 --> 45:46.482
I mean, maybe a little,

45:46.569 --> 45:48.223
but now I really do think
things can be better,

45:48.310 --> 45:50.138
I can do better, than you.

45:51.661 --> 45:53.402
- I don't want to
see you humiliated,

45:53.489 --> 45:55.535
but that interview was
frankly embarrassing.

45:55.622 --> 45:57.145
- You know how when you
first go into Disneyland-

45:57.232 --> 45:58.277
- You see?

45:58.364 --> 45:59.234
This is what I'm talking about.

45:59.321 --> 46:00.888
The world is not Disneyland.

46:00.975 --> 46:01.846
- Says who?

46:01.933 --> 46:03.543
Did you know-

46:03.630 --> 46:04.936
- Someone tell her that the
world is not Disneyland, okay?

46:05.023 --> 46:06.546
She needs some tough love here,

46:06.633 --> 46:08.200
a dose of reality at least!

46:08.287 --> 46:09.723
- Tough love?

46:09.810 --> 46:11.551
You can't just show up
here after two years

46:11.638 --> 46:13.205
and suddenly act like you care!

46:13.292 --> 46:14.554
- Guys!

46:14.641 --> 46:15.250
- Oh, okay, so
now it's about me.

46:15.337 --> 46:16.730
Well, guess what?

46:16.817 --> 46:18.079
Someone has to provide
for this family.

46:18.166 --> 46:18.950
- Oh, here we go!

46:19.037 --> 46:19.820
- I'm so over this!

46:19.907 --> 46:21.735
- Both of you, stop.

46:25.434 --> 46:28.698
[dramatic piano music]

46:37.795 --> 46:40.493
[wondrous music]

46:57.118 --> 46:58.424
- [Annie] What about
campaign funds?

46:58.511 --> 47:00.556
This is a real campaign,
we need real money.

47:00.643 --> 47:01.731
- Okay, so until we get more,

47:01.819 --> 47:03.124
we work with what we have.

47:03.211 --> 47:04.604
Great ideas and the
kind of ambition

47:04.691 --> 47:06.127
we're allowed this
one time in our lives,

47:06.214 --> 47:09.043
but I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for more money

47:09.130 --> 47:12.568
or to become mayor, or
to prove my dad wrong.

47:12.655 --> 47:14.135
We should start helping now.

47:14.222 --> 47:17.182
Serving the community now,
restoring Main Street now.

47:17.269 --> 47:18.836
- Whoa!

47:18.923 --> 47:21.142
You should like jump straight
to running for president.

47:21.229 --> 47:22.622
- You said it, Jess.

47:22.709 --> 47:24.842
This is our time to
roar, so let's roar.

47:24.929 --> 47:25.538
- Roar!

47:26.931 --> 47:28.758
- Kind of meant
that figuratively.

47:29.803 --> 47:31.239
So, who's in?

47:31.326 --> 47:33.502
Let's get every
student in this school,

47:33.589 --> 47:36.941
every kid in town, every jock,
braniac, get them together.

47:38.812 --> 47:41.684
And we're gonna show
them what we're made of.

47:41.771 --> 47:43.121
- [All] Roar!

47:43.208 --> 47:45.427

48:01.313 --> 48:02.749

48:02.836 --> 48:03.924
- What if I told you...

48:04.011 --> 48:05.273
- [All] We can do better!

48:07.362 --> 48:08.842
- Oh.

48:35.521 --> 48:37.392
- Whatever you're selling,
I ain't interested!

48:37.479 --> 48:39.394
- What about making
Main Street shine again?

48:39.481 --> 48:40.221
- Dream on!

48:40.308 --> 48:41.788
- We are!

48:41.875 --> 48:43.224
- What'd you say
your name is again?

48:43.311 --> 48:45.661
- I'm Mary Parson,
I'm running for mayor.

49:05.725 --> 49:06.726
- Yeah, did you guys
just move in here?

49:06.813 --> 49:07.901
- Yes, we did.
- We did.

49:07.988 --> 49:09.468
- Well, welcome to Echo Harbor.

49:09.555 --> 49:10.904
- Is every kid in town here?

49:10.991 --> 49:12.384
- Every kid that wants
to make this town better

49:12.471 --> 49:13.907
for you and your family.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.822
- [Man] You're the one
they've been talking about.

49:15.909 --> 49:17.258
- [Mary] If you mean...

49:17.345 --> 49:18.303
[cheering]

49:18.390 --> 49:19.869
- [Woman] Go Mary!

49:19.957 --> 49:22.916
- Then yep, I'm your
girl, woman, mayor person.

49:23.003 --> 49:24.962
[chuckling]

49:25.049 --> 49:27.834
[brooms sweeping]

49:30.924 --> 49:32.665
[water splashes]

49:32.752 --> 49:35.189
[catchy music]

49:44.677 --> 49:45.765
- Oh, hi there!

49:45.852 --> 49:47.158
- Need your windows washed?

49:47.245 --> 49:49.029
- I think they're
okay at the moment.

49:49.116 --> 49:50.030
Oh, great job out there.

49:50.117 --> 49:51.771
- You know how you were saying

49:51.858 --> 49:54.817
you might know some people who'd
invest here on Main Street?

49:54.904 --> 49:56.776
- If those ordinances
weren't in place.

49:56.863 --> 49:58.517
- One business, one corporation.

49:58.604 --> 49:59.344
- Right.

49:59.431 --> 50:00.954
It's a hurdle.

50:01.041 --> 50:02.825
If we could somehow
make that go away...

50:02.912 --> 50:06.133
- Well, if I became
mayor, maybe-

50:06.220 --> 50:07.917
- You've already got my vote,

50:08.005 --> 50:10.224
now you just gotta go
beat the other guy.

50:10.311 --> 50:11.573
- Right, there is that.

50:18.450 --> 50:19.886
Do I really have to do this?

50:19.973 --> 50:21.714
- If you want to beat
your dad, then yes,

50:21.801 --> 50:23.455
you have to debate
him on the issues.

50:23.542 --> 50:25.631
Not to mention, if I can
wear this stupid hat,

50:25.718 --> 50:26.893
you can debate.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.242
- Just read the cards.

50:28.329 --> 50:29.939
I got an A on my
essay using them.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.811
- Okay, but you're the one
that got an A using your notes,

50:31.898 --> 50:33.334
you should be running for mayor.

50:34.335 --> 50:35.771
- Are we ready?

50:35.858 --> 50:36.990
Are you nervous?

50:37.077 --> 50:37.860
I'm nervous.

50:37.947 --> 50:38.861
Anyone else nervous?

50:40.254 --> 50:41.864
Honey, I know I've
said it before,

50:41.951 --> 50:43.823
but it bears repeating,
so I'm gonna say it again.

50:43.910 --> 50:45.433
I am so proud of you.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.826
What a night!

50:46.913 --> 50:47.827
- If this doesn't
impress colleges,

50:47.914 --> 50:49.002
I don't know what will.

50:49.089 --> 50:50.917
- Everyone just breathe!

50:51.004 --> 50:52.179
- 5 minutes, everybody.

50:52.266 --> 50:53.746
It is packed out there.

50:53.833 --> 50:55.182
- I'm scared I'm gonna
get my first question,

50:55.269 --> 50:56.792
and then do a face
plant on the podium.

50:56.879 --> 50:58.272
- Focus on the notes.

50:58.359 --> 51:00.057
- Focus on what makes
Echo Harbor special.

51:00.144 --> 51:01.754
- Focus on you.

51:01.841 --> 51:02.842
That's our best shot.

51:02.929 --> 51:04.322
You being you, Mary.

51:04.409 --> 51:07.542
- Okay, you're officially
the greatest guy ever.

51:08.413 --> 51:09.631
- Just breathe.

51:11.938 --> 51:13.896
- History has
shown us repeatedly

51:13.983 --> 51:15.768
that when we act individually,

51:15.855 --> 51:19.511
with our own personal interests
in mind, societies collapse.

51:19.598 --> 51:22.644
So, in closing, that
is why economic renewal

51:22.731 --> 51:24.516
can only come through
individual development

51:24.603 --> 51:26.126
with a civic
universalist approach.

51:26.213 --> 51:27.867
Thank you.

51:27.954 --> 51:28.737
Your turn.

51:30.174 --> 51:32.524
[snoring]

51:32.611 --> 51:33.307
- Yeah!

51:33.394 --> 51:34.613
[clapping]

51:34.700 --> 51:37.094
[chuckling]

51:38.356 --> 51:39.879
- Thank you, Ed.

51:41.010 --> 51:41.968
- Thank you, Mary.

51:42.055 --> 51:43.578
- Mayor Parson.

51:43.665 --> 51:44.753
She's right, you're up.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.190
- Thank you, Rhonda.

51:46.277 --> 51:48.017
And thank you, Mary,
for those thoughts,

51:48.105 --> 51:49.367
I guess we're gonna call them.

51:49.454 --> 51:50.281
You did good, princess.

51:51.978 --> 51:56.417
"Save the town, rescue Main
Street, we can do better."

51:56.504 --> 51:57.984
Great sentiments.

51:58.071 --> 52:00.639
A bit naive, but naivety, well,

52:00.726 --> 52:01.988
that's the strength of youth.

52:03.381 --> 52:05.339
Cute t-shirts only go so far.

52:05.426 --> 52:07.646
The problem is
not in the desire,

52:07.733 --> 52:10.779
the problem is in
the means, the how.

52:10.866 --> 52:12.259
Now, I'm sorry princess,

52:12.346 --> 52:14.566
but your speech didn't
put forth any solid ideas

52:14.653 --> 52:18.744
on how we can actually save
Main Street, solutions.

52:18.831 --> 52:22.313
Like most of you, I grew
up here, I call this home.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.141
But let's be honest,

52:24.228 --> 52:26.055
our Main Street hasn't
been idyllic for what,

52:26.143 --> 52:27.535
over a decade.

52:27.622 --> 52:30.016
And guess what, we're
not alone in that.

52:30.103 --> 52:32.018
This is happening
all over the country.

52:32.105 --> 52:35.717
And look, maybe saving
something that's broken

52:35.804 --> 52:37.806
isn't the right approach anyway.

52:37.893 --> 52:39.939
Now, isn't it time
we all came together

52:40.026 --> 52:42.333
and started looking to the
future and not the past

52:42.420 --> 52:44.509
for our inspiration
and our solutions?

52:44.596 --> 52:46.075
We need to think
about the kind of town

52:46.163 --> 52:47.947
we're gonna be leaving
people like Mary.

52:48.034 --> 52:51.124
And yes, sometimes that's
gonna mean doing things

52:51.211 --> 52:53.039
that seem unpopular
in the moment,

52:53.126 --> 52:55.433
like letting
Smithfield's Ice Cream go

52:55.520 --> 52:56.434
and replacing it with a-

52:56.521 --> 52:57.870
- Yogurt?
- Shop.

52:57.957 --> 52:59.741
- This town isn't your
marriage or your family.

52:59.828 --> 53:01.134
- Mary.

53:01.221 --> 53:02.527
- You can't just
throw it all away

53:02.614 --> 53:04.050
'cause times are tough
and you're done with it.

53:04.137 --> 53:05.051
- [Rob] That is not
what I'm saying.

53:05.138 --> 53:06.444
- [Mary] Sure sounds like it.

53:06.531 --> 53:08.620
- Progress requires
some letting go.

53:08.707 --> 53:10.187
- You ever think that maybe

53:10.274 --> 53:13.146
everything and everyone
that you dump along the way

53:13.233 --> 53:14.060
for future...

53:15.801 --> 53:17.281
We can't get over
it as easily as you,

53:17.368 --> 53:18.934
okay, Mr. Mayor?

53:19.021 --> 53:21.502
- I think this is going
in the wrong direction.

53:21.589 --> 53:23.765
- Yeah, I don't think you can
take this personal, princess.

53:23.852 --> 53:25.332
- Then don't call me princess.

53:25.419 --> 53:27.595
And maybe making it personal
is the job of the mayor.

53:27.682 --> 53:28.814
- Not when it comes to business.

53:28.901 --> 53:30.337
Am I right, Rhonda?

53:30.424 --> 53:33.601
- Bernie Kostreva is not
a business, he's a person.

53:33.688 --> 53:35.299
His family hardware store

53:35.386 --> 53:37.257
has been the center of Main
Street for three generations,

53:37.344 --> 53:39.738
and it's about to go
away, he's gonna lose it.

53:39.825 --> 53:41.130
But here's the thing, Mr. Mayor.

53:41.218 --> 53:44.003
His business isn't
failing, he makes a profit

53:44.090 --> 53:45.526
month in and month out.

53:45.613 --> 53:47.311
Not much, but a profit.

53:47.398 --> 53:49.835
That hardware store has
outlasted the Depression,

53:49.922 --> 53:52.577
a world war, and 15 presidents.

53:52.664 --> 53:55.057
When the economy turned,
Bernie cut back on his expenses

53:55.144 --> 53:56.450
and increased his
personal hours.

53:56.537 --> 53:58.147
He gave credit to half the town

53:58.235 --> 53:59.671
and did so interest free.

53:59.758 --> 54:01.586
The storms two years ago
gave him flood damage

54:01.673 --> 54:02.761
that his insurance
wouldn't cover,

54:02.848 --> 54:04.415
but still, he stayed open,

54:04.502 --> 54:06.025
he kept his
employees on payroll,

54:06.112 --> 54:07.592
and he did what
each of us would do.

54:07.679 --> 54:09.115
The best he can.

54:09.202 --> 54:10.638
He was never done.

54:10.725 --> 54:12.074
But still, that wasn't enough.

54:12.161 --> 54:14.512
Not because his
business wasn't solid,

54:14.599 --> 54:16.078
or because he wasn't
trying hard enough,

54:16.165 --> 54:18.777
but because the drywall in
the back room wasn't solid.

54:18.864 --> 54:21.475
Too many floods back to back.

54:21.562 --> 54:24.261
So now, he's on a list.

54:24.348 --> 54:27.133
He has to fix it or get out.

54:27.220 --> 54:29.701
And that requires money that
he doesn't have anymore,

54:29.788 --> 54:32.225
because he was just doing
what he thought was best.

54:32.312 --> 54:34.227
The same goes for
so many other stores

54:34.314 --> 54:35.489
up and down the street.

54:35.576 --> 54:36.838
The ice cream parlor, the-

54:36.925 --> 54:38.884
- Okay, somebody's
been Googling.

54:38.971 --> 54:40.929
- No, Dad, I haven't
been Googling.

54:41.016 --> 54:42.322
I went out on the street

54:42.409 --> 54:44.063
and actually talked
with the people.

54:45.412 --> 54:46.761
You know, there isn't any law

54:46.848 --> 54:48.328
against the mayor
hitting the pavement

54:48.415 --> 54:51.592
and talking to the people
that he or she represents.

54:51.679 --> 54:53.246
You might want to
keep that in mind.

54:54.116 --> 54:55.074
- Yes!

54:55.161 --> 54:57.206
[clapping]

55:00.340 --> 55:02.211
[whistling]

55:02.299 --> 55:05.214
[triumphant music]

55:21.230 --> 55:23.363
[chuckling]

55:31.850 --> 55:33.721
- Thank you so much.

55:33.808 --> 55:34.592
- Hi!

55:35.636 --> 55:36.637
- Thank you.

55:36.724 --> 55:38.509
Thank you so much.

55:38.596 --> 55:40.162
- Thank you so much.

55:40.249 --> 55:43.165
[triumphant music]

55:52.305 --> 55:53.306
- He didn't know what hit him.

55:53.393 --> 55:55.482
[laughing]

55:55.569 --> 55:58.311
- I have tried for years
to get that man to zip it!

55:58.398 --> 55:59.878
- I can't believe all
these people came.

55:59.965 --> 56:01.270
Do you think any of
them will vote for me?

56:01.358 --> 56:02.533
- You know how the
town Facebook page

56:02.620 --> 56:04.230
has that polling feature?

56:04.317 --> 56:06.101
- Please tell me
we're at least 5%.

56:06.188 --> 56:07.102
- Oh yeah.

56:07.189 --> 56:08.103
- Double digits?

56:08.190 --> 56:09.148
- Mary, you're in the lead.

56:09.235 --> 56:11.193
[Jess gasps]

56:11.280 --> 56:15.110
- I love politics.

56:15.197 --> 56:15.937
- Right.

56:16.024 --> 56:16.982
[laughing]

56:17.069 --> 56:18.549
- Not to break up the love fest,

56:18.636 --> 56:20.551
but even though this isn't
an official fundraiser,

56:20.638 --> 56:22.204
it's kind of become that.

56:22.291 --> 56:24.163
I took off old Uncle Sam's
hat to let my head breathe,

56:24.250 --> 56:25.294
and the next thing you know,

56:25.382 --> 56:27.122
I have over 600 bucks in it.

56:27.209 --> 56:28.602
- Feed the beast!
- Feed the beast!

56:28.689 --> 56:29.211
- Done.

56:30.517 --> 56:31.910
Mary, you were
brilliant tonight.

56:31.997 --> 56:34.086
You have my admiration
and full support.

56:36.697 --> 56:38.264
- It's for $5,000.

56:38.351 --> 56:39.787
- Yes, yes.
- Oh!

56:39.874 --> 56:41.528
- We have a town to save.

56:41.615 --> 56:43.182
- I don't know what to say.

56:43.269 --> 56:44.052
- I do.

56:44.139 --> 56:45.706
Fundraising selfie!

56:45.793 --> 56:47.316
[chuckling]

56:47.404 --> 56:49.449
[laughing]

56:51.364 --> 56:54.411
[lighthearted music]

56:55.890 --> 56:57.283
- It's like everyone
disappeared,

56:57.370 --> 56:59.154
and I just said whatever
was in my heart.

56:59.241 --> 57:00.547
To be honest, I don't
remember most of it.

57:00.634 --> 57:02.767
- Sounds like you
found your voice.

57:02.854 --> 57:04.029
- Me as mayor.

57:04.116 --> 57:04.899
Who'd of thought?

57:06.510 --> 57:09.382
- Can I give you some advice?

57:09.469 --> 57:12.124
- As my pastor or as my grandpa?

57:12.211 --> 57:13.517
- I think they're
one in the same.

57:13.604 --> 57:15.040
To be a good pastor,

57:15.127 --> 57:16.911
you have to think of
everyone as your grandchild.

57:16.998 --> 57:18.260
- That's a lot of
birthday presents.

57:18.347 --> 57:19.610
- Yeah.

57:19.697 --> 57:20.524
There was that
part in the debate,

57:20.611 --> 57:21.612
what was it you said?

57:23.483 --> 57:26.617
"We can't forget that
behind all the businesses

57:26.704 --> 57:27.313
are real people."

57:27.400 --> 57:28.662
- Yeah.

57:28.749 --> 57:29.576
I just remember helping
out Mr. Kostreva,

57:29.663 --> 57:31.143
and how devastated he was

57:31.230 --> 57:33.014
over the thought of losing
his family business.

57:33.101 --> 57:36.235
- My advice is to keep
that wisdom in your heart.

57:37.671 --> 57:39.673
- Behind every
business is a person.

57:39.760 --> 57:41.196
- And behind every politician.

57:42.371 --> 57:44.373
- Are you talking about my dad?

57:44.461 --> 57:45.244
- A little.

57:46.288 --> 57:47.464
I'm also talking about you.

57:50.379 --> 57:51.816
Uh oh.

57:51.903 --> 57:53.208
Go on, I'll clean up here.

57:53.295 --> 57:55.863
Go on, be nice.

57:55.950 --> 57:59.127
[lighthearted music]

57:59.214 --> 58:00.607
- [chuckling] Hi.

58:00.694 --> 58:03.784
[lighthearted music]

58:12.706 --> 58:15.753
- So, we've expanded the bake
sales to every afternoon.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.276
- And after the game,

58:17.363 --> 58:19.321
we're gonna have a pep
rally in the square.

58:19.408 --> 58:21.149
- You should get the
Girl Scouts involved.

58:21.236 --> 58:23.238
They're a bunch of pushy broads.

58:23.325 --> 58:24.283
- Oh, Mary!

58:24.370 --> 58:25.806
- Excuse me, excuse me.

58:25.893 --> 58:27.286
Family and volunteers only.

58:27.373 --> 58:28.287
- She's with me.

58:28.374 --> 58:30.028
- She doesn't have a vest on!

58:30.115 --> 58:31.290
- Charming.

58:31.377 --> 58:33.118
Mary, can I have a quick word?

58:33.205 --> 58:33.988
Sorry.

58:40.081 --> 58:42.823
[whimsical music]

58:44.738 --> 58:45.739
Get in, please.

58:53.617 --> 58:57.011
[car doors close]

58:57.098 --> 58:58.491
- Bake sales and pep rallies.

58:58.578 --> 58:59.405
Cute.

58:59.492 --> 59:00.319
- I'm sorry, who are you?

59:00.406 --> 59:01.929
- Oh, this is Eugene.

59:02.016 --> 59:04.323
A good friend and a professional
political consultant.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.412
- I've run three successful
mayoral campaigns.

59:06.499 --> 59:08.370
One in New York, two in D.C.

59:08.457 --> 59:09.371
Not a nice playground.

59:09.458 --> 59:10.895
- Oh, so-

59:10.982 --> 59:12.374
- Olivia sent along a
copy of your debate.

59:12.461 --> 59:14.638
Raw, but there's something...

59:14.725 --> 59:17.031
- What he's trying to say
is you show potential.

59:17.118 --> 59:18.990
He doesn't like to
reveal his cards.

59:19.077 --> 59:20.513
- Mary, you need to stop acting

59:20.600 --> 59:21.775
like you want to be
homecoming queen.

59:21.862 --> 59:23.560
- Ew, I would never do that.

59:23.647 --> 59:25.562
- No more daddy's
little princess.

59:25.649 --> 59:27.346
- Okay, where do I sign up?

59:30.871 --> 59:32.569
This is for $20,000.

59:32.656 --> 59:33.831
- She can be the real deal.

59:33.918 --> 59:35.006
Echo Bay-
- Harbor.

59:35.093 --> 59:36.964
- Who knows from there?

59:37.051 --> 59:38.575
There, cards are on the table.

59:40.533 --> 59:41.578
- Hey!

59:41.665 --> 59:43.188
- [Eugene] Bake sales are over.

59:43.275 --> 59:45.407
- [Mary] Sure, but we
just cleaned this street.

59:48.367 --> 59:49.324
- Wow!

59:49.411 --> 59:50.369
[clapping]
- Really?

59:50.456 --> 59:51.762
- Just enough Hilary with a dose

59:51.849 --> 59:53.372
of classic Margaret Thatcher.

59:53.459 --> 59:54.765
- One lost and the
other one's dead.

59:54.852 --> 59:56.201
- How about...

59:56.288 --> 59:58.029
Jennifer Lawrence
eat your heart out.

59:59.117 --> 1:00:00.379
- I can get used to that.

1:00:00.466 --> 1:00:03.382
- This suit says power,
it says authority.

1:00:03.469 --> 1:00:06.080
- Power, authority.

1:00:08.126 --> 1:00:08.866
Cool.

1:00:08.953 --> 1:00:09.693
- Next.

1:00:10.781 --> 1:00:14.306
[dramatic music]

1:00:14.393 --> 1:00:15.176
Perfect.

1:00:19.877 --> 1:00:23.184
[camera shutter snaps]

1:00:31.323 --> 1:00:32.716
- No one's hit
Division Street yet.

1:00:32.803 --> 1:00:34.456
- Dude, seriously, I would
never live over there,

1:00:34.543 --> 1:00:36.415
and I'd pretty much sleep
in a dumpster if I had to.

1:00:36.502 --> 1:00:38.025
- Guys, we need people
working Main Street still,

1:00:38.112 --> 1:00:39.940
that's the focus
of our campaign.

1:00:41.115 --> 1:00:42.073
Finally!

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:42.856
- Hey, guys.

1:00:44.510 --> 1:00:45.903
- I'm sorry, who are you?

1:00:45.990 --> 1:00:47.121
- Oh, you like?

1:00:47.208 --> 1:00:48.427
Eugene hautcoutured me.

1:00:49.471 --> 1:00:50.516
- Again, who are you?

1:00:50.603 --> 1:00:52.170
- Uh, who is Eugene?

1:00:53.345 --> 1:00:55.173
- You're not dressed to clean.

1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:56.653
- I don't know, I think
she looks kind of hot.

1:00:56.740 --> 1:00:58.437
- She looks like she's 60.

1:00:58.524 --> 1:01:00.047
- Mary, what's going on here?

1:01:00.134 --> 1:01:01.353
- Long story, but so good.

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:02.833
We got a huge donation,

1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:04.486
Olivia's introducing
me to her investors,

1:01:04.573 --> 1:01:06.488
Eugene set up a hair
and nail thingy,

1:01:06.575 --> 1:01:07.881
and they all want to help!

1:01:07.968 --> 1:01:09.491
- Again, who's Eugene?

1:01:09.578 --> 1:01:11.189
- Shouldn't you
be seen, you know,

1:01:11.276 --> 1:01:13.017
cleaning up the town, with us?

1:01:13.104 --> 1:01:14.496
- Actually, Olivia
wants me to focus

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:16.498
on spreading our optics.

1:01:16.585 --> 1:01:17.978
You know, me with
the businesses,

1:01:18.065 --> 1:01:20.241
you guys with the
little clean up thingy.

1:01:20.328 --> 1:01:21.547
- Spread our optics?

1:01:21.634 --> 1:01:22.722
- Clean up thingy?

1:01:22.809 --> 1:01:25.420
Yeah, I'm feeling optics.

1:01:25.507 --> 1:01:27.248
- You guys, I would
love to stay and chat,

1:01:27.335 --> 1:01:28.641
but I have to go to
campaign headquarters.

1:01:28.728 --> 1:01:30.861
- This is our
campaign headquarters.

1:01:30.948 --> 1:01:32.166
- Eugene set up a
new headquarters

1:01:32.253 --> 1:01:34.081
for our platinum
donors and call center.

1:01:34.168 --> 1:01:36.214
- Again, who is Eugene?

1:01:40.914 --> 1:01:42.916
- If I want to win, I have
to play like a winner,

1:01:43.003 --> 1:01:45.527
not someone who's trying
to be homecoming queen.

1:01:45.614 --> 1:01:46.659
No offense, Jess.

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:51.272
You guys, I'm just trying
to reach my full potential

1:01:51.359 --> 1:01:53.144
maybe for the first
time in my life.

1:01:53.231 --> 1:01:55.537
Imagine what good I can
do if I become mayor.

1:01:55.624 --> 1:01:57.235
What good we can do.

1:01:57.322 --> 1:01:59.759
Isn't that what we wanted,
why we did this whole thing?

1:02:01.587 --> 1:02:04.155
I tell you what, after
my little meet and greet

1:02:04.242 --> 1:02:06.418
cheese cracker thingy,
I'll come back and help.

1:02:06.505 --> 1:02:07.767
Promise.

1:02:07.854 --> 1:02:09.073
Gotta go, love you guys.

1:02:14.687 --> 1:02:17.168
- You know Cleopatra had her
brother and sister murdered?

1:02:17.255 --> 1:02:19.605
Looks like power in the hands
of a desperate, young woman

1:02:19.692 --> 1:02:20.737
might have a downside.

1:02:22.739 --> 1:02:24.523
- Look what she's
done with this place.

1:02:24.610 --> 1:02:26.525
Olivia came in with a vision,

1:02:26.612 --> 1:02:29.093
cleaned up the building,
and created a new business.

1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:32.270
Working together, we can
save all of Main Street.

1:02:32.357 --> 1:02:33.793
- I'm sorry, forgive me.

1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:35.795
I appreciate everything
you said about me

1:02:35.882 --> 1:02:36.796
at the debate, sweetie.

1:02:38.319 --> 1:02:40.278
Tell me again how
this works exactly?

1:02:41.670 --> 1:02:43.063
- Mr. Kostreva.

1:02:43.150 --> 1:02:44.717
First of all, your
family's history here

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:47.328
is the wonderful heartbeat
of this extraordinary town.

1:02:48.895 --> 1:02:51.289
My group of investors,
all good friends,

1:02:51.376 --> 1:02:52.812
are going to buy the
buildings on Main Street

1:02:52.899 --> 1:02:54.596
that have already closed down.

1:02:54.683 --> 1:02:56.381
- Assuming we can get
the ordinance lifted

1:02:56.468 --> 1:02:57.730
so that they could
buy more than one.

1:02:57.817 --> 1:02:58.905
- [Olivia] That's right.

1:02:58.992 --> 1:02:59.732
- And with that money-

1:02:59.819 --> 1:03:00.602
- Capital.

1:03:01.647 --> 1:03:02.996
- Capital for those purchases,

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:05.216
we will also include
some money for a-

1:03:05.303 --> 1:03:06.739
- General building fund.

1:03:06.826 --> 1:03:09.350
- Which we then use
as non interest loans

1:03:09.437 --> 1:03:11.265
for small businesses like yours,

1:03:11.352 --> 1:03:14.791
bring them up to code,
make those bad men go away.

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:17.402
- Okay, so, what's in it
for you, Ms. Wharf-Hill?

1:03:19.752 --> 1:03:22.799
- Main Street thrives,
Olivia's business here thrives.

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:24.626
A rising tide lifts all boats.

1:03:24.713 --> 1:03:26.193
My gamps taught me that one.

1:03:27.673 --> 1:03:29.936
[whispering]

1:03:32.112 --> 1:03:34.811
[catchy music]

1:04:02.534 --> 1:04:03.796
- Is there any
further discussion

1:04:03.883 --> 1:04:05.406
on the sewage
extension proposal?

1:04:06.843 --> 1:04:08.105
Mary?

1:04:08.192 --> 1:04:09.758
- I'd like to
address the council.

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:11.282
- Princess, we're in the
middle of something here, okay?

1:04:11.369 --> 1:04:12.761
Can you please just go home?

1:04:12.849 --> 1:04:13.893
- Move to table current business

1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:15.764
and go straight to new business.

1:04:16.635 --> 1:04:18.028
- I second that.

1:04:18.115 --> 1:04:20.073
- Well, Mary, looks like
you have our attention.

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:22.293
- Come on, guys, we
don't have time for this.

1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:23.729
- I'd like to ask the council

1:04:23.816 --> 1:04:25.687
to repeal the corporate
limitation ordinance,

1:04:25.774 --> 1:04:27.864
and to do it like, now,
if that's possible.

1:04:27.951 --> 1:04:30.170
- The limitation is
in place for a reason.

1:04:30.257 --> 1:04:31.606
- Yeah, to help
you with your mall.

1:04:31.693 --> 1:04:33.043
- No.
- What?

1:04:33.130 --> 1:04:34.740
- My father has
been quietly helping

1:04:34.827 --> 1:04:36.176
build a mall in Port Byron,

1:04:36.263 --> 1:04:37.917
which of course
would do a lot better

1:04:38.004 --> 1:04:40.354
if it wasn't competing with
businesses here in Echo Harbor.

1:04:40.441 --> 1:04:43.053
- There's plenty of room for
our downtown and the mall.

1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:44.532
- Sure.

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:46.665
If overflow is your
big fix to save us.

1:04:48.449 --> 1:04:50.756
We all know that
an anonymous report

1:04:50.843 --> 1:04:53.715
lead the GSA to putting up
notices all around town.

1:04:53.802 --> 1:04:55.848
Well, it's no longer anonymous.

1:04:55.935 --> 1:04:57.763
Our mayor is the one
that reported us.

1:04:57.850 --> 1:04:58.982
- That is not true.

1:04:59.069 --> 1:05:00.548
- I have pictures, Dad.

1:05:00.635 --> 1:05:01.680
- If Rob's selling us out,

1:05:01.767 --> 1:05:03.116
and Rob's the main proponent

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:05.249
to the corporate
limitation ordinance,

1:05:05.336 --> 1:05:07.860
then maybe we need
to really consider-

1:05:07.947 --> 1:05:10.167
- No, I have not
sold anybody out.

1:05:10.254 --> 1:05:11.603
We voted on this, all of us.

1:05:11.690 --> 1:05:13.300
- I move that we
strike the ordinance.

1:05:13.387 --> 1:05:14.736
- Second.

1:05:14.823 --> 1:05:15.650
- Movement seconded.

1:05:15.737 --> 1:05:17.000
The ordinance is repealed.

1:05:17.087 --> 1:05:18.044
Thank you, Mr. Land.

1:05:19.698 --> 1:05:20.438
- That was easy.

1:05:22.092 --> 1:05:23.484
- Who do you think I am?

1:05:23.571 --> 1:05:26.444
- A guy who used to
call himself mayor.

1:05:26.531 --> 1:05:27.662
[laughing]

1:05:27.749 --> 1:05:30.578
[phone ringing]

1:05:34.104 --> 1:05:36.933
Jordan, please
call me, somebody.

1:05:38.586 --> 1:05:39.544
Radio blackout.

1:05:41.981 --> 1:05:43.417
You should've seen it.

1:05:43.504 --> 1:05:44.941
Pretty amazing.

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.768
The look on dad's face.

1:05:46.855 --> 1:05:48.379
- I'm glad I didn't.

1:05:48.466 --> 1:05:49.206
- Why?

1:05:50.424 --> 1:05:51.904
- Politics.

1:05:51.991 --> 1:05:53.558
Us versus them.

1:05:53.645 --> 1:05:55.473
Somebody's always made
to be the villain.

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:58.911
- Well, if they're
wrong, they should be.

1:05:58.998 --> 1:06:02.001
You could listen and love
them, but they're still wrong.

1:06:04.482 --> 1:06:05.222
- I don't know.

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:07.746
What would happen if politics

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:09.530
wasn't about winning
and being right?

1:06:11.097 --> 1:06:12.359
- What's left after that?

1:06:13.708 --> 1:06:14.927
- The people, of course.

1:06:19.888 --> 1:06:22.282
- I gotta go, see
what's going on.

1:06:22.369 --> 1:06:23.501
- I ironed your jacket.

1:06:23.588 --> 1:06:24.893
- What?

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:27.722
It's like dry clean
only, didn't you read...

1:06:27.809 --> 1:06:28.549
Ugh!

1:06:28.636 --> 1:06:29.420
So stressful.

1:06:33.511 --> 1:06:34.947
Come on, guys.

1:06:35.034 --> 1:06:36.775
You're gonna have to
talk to me eventually.

1:06:36.862 --> 1:06:39.908
- Robert's rules of
order, no we don't.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.345
- What did I do?

1:06:41.432 --> 1:06:42.868
I did so well last
night, I killed it.

1:06:42.955 --> 1:06:44.435
- What happened to "we"?

1:06:44.522 --> 1:06:46.002
- Yeah, your Machiavellian
ways are impressive,

1:06:46.089 --> 1:06:47.394
if not a little bit spooky.

1:06:47.481 --> 1:06:49.005
- Use your friends
to gain power,

1:06:49.092 --> 1:06:51.659
then drop them and your
constituents along the way.

1:06:51.746 --> 1:06:53.226
You're like a
backstabbing Caesar.

1:06:53.313 --> 1:06:54.749
We love it.

1:06:54.836 --> 1:06:56.360
- Caesar was the one
who got stabbed, bro.

1:06:58.927 --> 1:06:59.972
- Jordan?

1:07:03.497 --> 1:07:05.108
Fine.

1:07:05.195 --> 1:07:07.327
This isn't the first time
this has happened in my life!

1:07:11.244 --> 1:07:12.506
[door slams]

1:07:12.593 --> 1:07:13.899
For all the great
success I thought I had

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:16.510
already achieved before
even becoming mayor,

1:07:16.597 --> 1:07:17.816
something wasn't right.

1:07:17.903 --> 1:07:19.296
I was feeling so great,

1:07:19.383 --> 1:07:20.993
everything I wanted
was coming together,

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.300
and suddenly everyone hated me.

1:07:23.387 --> 1:07:25.041
And those pantsuits.

1:07:25.128 --> 1:07:27.260
Let's just say they
started to itch.

1:07:27.347 --> 1:07:30.611
[dramatic piano music]

1:07:34.746 --> 1:07:36.052
I don't get it.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.494
It's so confusing.

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:45.017
- Oh, you'll be fine, dear.

1:07:46.453 --> 1:07:47.889
- Not so sure about that.

1:07:47.976 --> 1:07:50.501
I got good news and bad news.

1:07:50.588 --> 1:07:52.416
- I don't like that game.

1:07:52.503 --> 1:07:55.114
- The good news is that Olivia
has bought her building.

1:07:55.201 --> 1:07:57.029
- That's awesome!
- Oh!

1:07:57.116 --> 1:07:58.639
- And the bad news?

1:07:58.726 --> 1:08:00.076
- She's tearing it down.

1:08:00.902 --> 1:08:02.252
- What?

1:08:02.339 --> 1:08:05.472
- There it is, the
old bait and switch.

1:08:05.559 --> 1:08:07.387
- We have to move
out by January.

1:08:07.474 --> 1:08:09.128
- This doesn't make any sense.

1:08:09.215 --> 1:08:10.521
- There she is!

1:08:10.608 --> 1:08:11.957
- Mary.

1:08:12.044 --> 1:08:13.567
Your friend Olivia just
bought half the town,

1:08:13.654 --> 1:08:15.003
and she's planning
to rip it down.

1:08:15.091 --> 1:08:16.309
- What about the
general building fund?

1:08:16.396 --> 1:08:18.006
- There is no building fund.

1:08:18.094 --> 1:08:19.573
- Not only that, now she's
putting the squeeze on us

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:20.574
to sell our businesses.

1:08:20.661 --> 1:08:22.010
- Even me.

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:23.969
- No more ice cream!

1:08:24.056 --> 1:08:27.451
- There has to be
a misunderstanding,
she promised me.

1:08:27.538 --> 1:08:30.193
[dramatic music]

1:08:33.196 --> 1:08:34.719
- Straight to voicemail?

1:08:34.806 --> 1:08:35.676
- Yup.

1:08:35.763 --> 1:08:37.809
Pumped and dumped us.

1:08:37.896 --> 1:08:40.594
[dramatic music]

1:09:04.575 --> 1:09:07.143
- [Bernie] What's in it
for you, Ms. Wharf-Hill?

1:09:08.709 --> 1:09:11.538
- [Olivia] If those
ordinances weren't in place...

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:13.453
- [Mary] One business,
one corporation.

1:09:15.063 --> 1:09:17.153
- [Olivia] If we could
somehow make that go away...

1:09:20.112 --> 1:09:22.375
- Ms. Crompton will
be with you shortly.

1:09:22.462 --> 1:09:23.898
- I'm here to see
Ms. Wharf-Hill.

1:09:23.985 --> 1:09:25.030
- One in the same.

1:09:32.646 --> 1:09:36.084
- [Mary] And there it was,
right in front of my eyes.

1:09:38.130 --> 1:09:39.131
Olivia's plan.

1:09:41.002 --> 1:09:43.440
Formerly known as Echo Harbor.

1:09:43.527 --> 1:09:44.615
- Pretty cool, isn't it?

1:09:45.616 --> 1:09:47.705
A world class resort.

1:09:47.792 --> 1:09:50.882
And if things go my way,
which they usually do,

1:09:50.969 --> 1:09:53.667
grandest casino
this side of Vegas.

1:09:53.754 --> 1:09:55.887
- So, let me get this straight.

1:09:55.974 --> 1:09:57.889
You buy up everything you can,

1:09:57.976 --> 1:09:59.282
you let the rest
go out of business,

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:01.762
and then you can get
everything for nothing.

1:10:01.849 --> 1:10:02.981
It's all yours.

1:10:03.068 --> 1:10:04.243
- Aren't you clever?

1:10:05.766 --> 1:10:07.464
Yes, the unfortunate
world of cause and effect.

1:10:07.551 --> 1:10:08.987
It's just business.

1:10:09.074 --> 1:10:11.076
- You never intended
on saving Echo Harbor.

1:10:11.163 --> 1:10:13.557
- Aren't I saving it,
giving it new life?

1:10:13.644 --> 1:10:16.037
- By turning it
into what, a resort?

1:10:16.124 --> 1:10:18.475
My friends at Sunnyside in
the last years of their lives

1:10:18.562 --> 1:10:19.911
are gonna have to
find new homes.

1:10:19.998 --> 1:10:21.304
- Life moves on, Mary,

1:10:21.391 --> 1:10:22.740
but Echo Harbor will
always be there.

1:10:22.827 --> 1:10:24.045
- This isn't who we are.

1:10:24.132 --> 1:10:25.569
- No, but it's
who you'll become.

1:10:25.656 --> 1:10:27.484
You do understand
that now, don't you?

1:10:28.615 --> 1:10:30.138
- You manipulated me.

1:10:30.226 --> 1:10:31.749
- I like to think
I educated you.

1:10:32.706 --> 1:10:34.665
Which reminds me...

1:10:34.752 --> 1:10:37.145
You're a natural, Mary,
great for politics.

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:39.539
You have this thing,
people believe in you.

1:10:39.626 --> 1:10:41.976
Hey, maybe one day you'll
come and work for me.

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:46.720
- What's this?

1:10:46.807 --> 1:10:48.156
- A letter of recommendation

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:50.071
to whatever college
you want to go to.

1:10:50.158 --> 1:10:51.986
With that, you don't
need daddy's help.

1:10:52.073 --> 1:10:53.423
You see, I'm British.

1:10:53.510 --> 1:10:55.033
I've got clout.

1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:56.382
The Empire and all that.

1:10:56.469 --> 1:10:58.079
- The empire you lost.

1:10:58.166 --> 1:11:00.081
- Bad management,
what can I say?

1:11:00.168 --> 1:11:01.039
- You're going to lose again.

1:11:01.126 --> 1:11:02.432
- Oh, I never lose, sweetie.

1:11:03.476 --> 1:11:05.130
Ask all my ex-husbands.

1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:16.968
[dramatic piano music]

1:11:23.366 --> 1:11:24.932
- What a mess.

1:11:25.019 --> 1:11:27.108
- Your whole town just got
sold out from under you.

1:11:27.195 --> 1:11:28.153
That's gotta sting.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.590
- No, not that, Mary.

1:11:30.677 --> 1:11:34.115
She's been betrayed,
she's out there hurting.

1:11:34.202 --> 1:11:35.813
What could be more important?

1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:37.162
- He's human after all.

1:11:38.946 --> 1:11:40.252
- Is it too late
to say I'm sorry?

1:11:40.339 --> 1:11:41.253
- Never.

1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:42.167
Let's hear it.

1:11:43.211 --> 1:11:44.300
- You're relentless.

1:11:45.170 --> 1:11:46.127
[chuckling]

1:11:46.214 --> 1:11:46.954
I'm sorry, Loren.

1:11:48.434 --> 1:11:50.523
This job, feeling important.

1:11:52.046 --> 1:11:54.135
My pride, ego, I
don't know, whatever.

1:11:54.222 --> 1:11:56.181
It blocked my view
of the whole reason

1:11:56.268 --> 1:11:57.574
I wanted to be mayor.

1:11:57.661 --> 1:11:59.663
- When did you get
that wake up call?

1:11:59.750 --> 1:12:00.838
- Honestly?

1:12:00.925 --> 1:12:02.361
It was the night of the debate.

1:12:02.448 --> 1:12:04.624
Halfway through her
eviscerating me,

1:12:04.711 --> 1:12:07.235
I thought "Who is this
amazing young woman?"

1:12:10.195 --> 1:12:11.457
And that's my daughter.

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:14.895
She's a lot like you.

1:12:14.982 --> 1:12:17.158
- And not without some of you.

1:12:17.245 --> 1:12:20.292
[dramatic piano music]

1:12:32.652 --> 1:12:34.132
- I fell for it.

1:12:34.219 --> 1:12:35.525
- Hook, line, and sinker.

1:12:37.048 --> 1:12:37.918
What?

1:12:38.005 --> 1:12:38.702
That's funny.

1:12:38.789 --> 1:12:39.355
- Ha ha.

1:12:40.443 --> 1:12:42.358
- Look, Mary, it's seductive.

1:12:42.445 --> 1:12:44.882
Power, attention.

1:12:44.969 --> 1:12:46.318
It got to both your dad and I.

1:12:47.928 --> 1:12:49.408
You were doomed.

1:12:49.495 --> 1:12:52.455
- Still, I made everything
worse, divided the family.

1:12:52.542 --> 1:12:54.152
- I think your
dad and mom played

1:12:54.239 --> 1:12:55.849
a pretty good role in that.

1:12:55.936 --> 1:12:56.937
- So, what now?

1:12:57.024 --> 1:12:58.852
Sunnyside is about to go away,

1:12:58.939 --> 1:13:00.114
and Echo Harbor as we know it

1:13:00.201 --> 1:13:01.246
is on the brink of extinction.

1:13:02.987 --> 1:13:05.337
- And don't forget, all of
your friends have deserted you.

1:13:08.340 --> 1:13:10.734
Well, almost all of them.

1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:14.520
- Sorry?

1:13:17.610 --> 1:13:18.829
- So, what's left, Mary?

1:13:19.873 --> 1:13:21.222
Who's left?

1:13:21.309 --> 1:13:22.876
Who can fix this?

1:13:22.963 --> 1:13:23.747
- Me?

1:13:30.841 --> 1:13:34.235
Gamps, was Sunnyside really
a veterinary hospital?

1:13:34.322 --> 1:13:35.933
Franklin said
something about it.

1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:37.325
- Yeah.

1:13:37.413 --> 1:13:39.632
Yeah, it was called
Emory before Sunnyside.

1:13:39.719 --> 1:13:42.679
- So, like, does that
make it a landmark?

1:13:42.766 --> 1:13:43.854
- I don't know.

1:13:43.941 --> 1:13:44.811
Why?

1:13:44.898 --> 1:13:46.639
- I think I have an idea.

1:13:46.726 --> 1:13:49.381
[wondrous music]

1:14:02.742 --> 1:14:06.572
- As you all know, Evelyn,
the love of my life,

1:14:08.139 --> 1:14:12.099
our sweet Evelyn, we lost
her several years ago.

1:14:13.318 --> 1:14:15.059
And she was my everything.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.456
So it's no wonder it shook me
to the core when she passed.

1:14:23.328 --> 1:14:24.895
And if I'm to be truthful,

1:14:26.462 --> 1:14:28.202
I have not yet been
able to bring myself

1:14:28.289 --> 1:14:31.771
to a point of forgiveness

1:14:33.338 --> 1:14:35.035
for any role that I
played in all that.

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:38.604
My job here, it's
relatively simple.

1:14:40.301 --> 1:14:44.131
Honor God, and be truthful
with all of you, and myself.

1:14:45.698 --> 1:14:47.265
And yet I've not
done what I so often

1:14:47.352 --> 1:14:50.616
ask each of you to do in the
darkest moments of your lives.

1:14:52.531 --> 1:14:54.664
I wasn't there on that awful day

1:14:54.751 --> 1:14:58.406
that they took Evy
to the hospital,

1:14:58.494 --> 1:14:59.799
she's already lifeless.

1:15:03.150 --> 1:15:07.938
I wasn't there much at
all back then, for years.

1:15:08.025 --> 1:15:10.288
I had my book, ya'll
know about that.

1:15:10.375 --> 1:15:12.377
Next thing you know, I'm
missing Sundays with all of you,

1:15:12.464 --> 1:15:13.900
my favorite thing in the world,

1:15:13.987 --> 1:15:17.251
because I'm off lecturing
and talking and preaching.

1:15:17.338 --> 1:15:19.427
[laughing]

1:15:21.342 --> 1:15:23.257
I gotta tell you, it felt good.

1:15:23.344 --> 1:15:24.302
Oh, it felt good.

1:15:24.389 --> 1:15:26.609
No, it felt tremendous!

1:15:26.696 --> 1:15:28.393
I was popular.

1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:30.526
And I've got this new authority,

1:15:30.613 --> 1:15:32.484
and darn it if I'm
not gonna milk it

1:15:32.571 --> 1:15:33.659
for everything it's worth.

1:15:36.662 --> 1:15:37.576
Family trait.

1:15:41.014 --> 1:15:43.147
I think so often, all of us,

1:15:43.234 --> 1:15:45.671
we get lost in our
jobs and our work,

1:15:45.758 --> 1:15:48.805
that we forget that life
isn't about our job,

1:15:48.892 --> 1:15:50.371
our job is there
to service our life

1:15:50.458 --> 1:15:51.895
so we can serve God.

1:15:53.505 --> 1:15:58.031
So, Evy collapsed in our
house just across the way,

1:15:58.118 --> 1:15:59.163
most of you have been there

1:15:59.250 --> 1:16:01.382
for one of her wonderful meals.

1:16:03.123 --> 1:16:06.649
She collapsed, and
I wasn't there.

1:16:06.736 --> 1:16:08.128
I wasn't there to help her.

1:16:11.436 --> 1:16:13.394
It was hours before
she was even found.

1:16:16.310 --> 1:16:18.574
I've never been able to
forgive myself for that.

1:16:21.446 --> 1:16:24.492
So, starting today,
in this very place,

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:27.887
in this very moment,
complete honesty.

1:16:27.974 --> 1:16:30.150
And perhaps working
together with God's grace,

1:16:30.237 --> 1:16:32.152
whatever happens to
our sleepy hollow,

1:16:32.239 --> 1:16:34.154
our great history
becomes our tomorrow,

1:16:34.241 --> 1:16:36.592
whatever happens...

1:16:39.638 --> 1:16:42.119
Perhaps forgiveness should be

1:16:42.206 --> 1:16:44.730
the first and last
thought of every day.

1:16:45.818 --> 1:16:48.865
[lighthearted music]

1:17:00.528 --> 1:17:01.921
- You working the counter today?

1:17:02.008 --> 1:17:03.444
- I convinced Smitty
to give it to us

1:17:03.531 --> 1:17:04.532
all to ourselves.

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:05.838
- It's good to be mayor.

1:17:07.927 --> 1:17:08.798
So, what's up?

1:17:08.885 --> 1:17:10.495
- Uh, us?

1:17:10.582 --> 1:17:12.410
- Right, I owe you an apology.

1:17:12.497 --> 1:17:14.978
- Well, yeah, you do actually.

1:17:15.065 --> 1:17:16.893
- You didn't report the
buildings not being to code.

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:18.721
- No, but I did
get the GSA agent

1:17:18.808 --> 1:17:20.548
to finally admit it was Olivia.

1:17:20.636 --> 1:17:21.985
- When I saw you with that guy-

1:17:22.072 --> 1:17:23.421
- GSA makes a complaint,

1:17:23.508 --> 1:17:25.597
the Mayor's required
to meet with him.

1:17:25.684 --> 1:17:26.511
- My bad on that one.

1:17:27.512 --> 1:17:28.992
- It doesn't excuse the way

1:17:29.079 --> 1:17:31.429
that I've been acting
throughout this whole thing.

1:17:34.824 --> 1:17:35.955
I made some mistakes, Mary.

1:17:37.522 --> 1:17:38.915
I didn't understand
why you got so upset

1:17:39.002 --> 1:17:41.613
when I stopped fighting
for places like this.

1:17:42.527 --> 1:17:43.702
- Lots of memories.

1:17:43.789 --> 1:17:45.095
- Yeah.

1:17:45.182 --> 1:17:47.706
And every weekend,
since you were 5-

1:17:47.793 --> 1:17:49.403
- Father-daughter date days.

1:17:49.490 --> 1:17:52.232
I had you and chocolate chip
cookie dough all to myself.

1:17:52.319 --> 1:17:54.887
- And I had you, and rocky road.

1:17:54.974 --> 1:17:57.237
[laughing]

1:18:00.893 --> 1:18:01.677
I'm sorry.

1:18:03.417 --> 1:18:08.074
I guess I just still see
you as my little girl.

1:18:09.075 --> 1:18:10.860
You know, a princess.

1:18:12.557 --> 1:18:14.559
But you're not a little
girl anymore, I...

1:18:14.646 --> 1:18:15.908
- So they say.

1:18:15.995 --> 1:18:18.519
- You are a
beautiful, incredible,

1:18:18.606 --> 1:18:20.130
whip smart talented woman.

1:18:20.217 --> 1:18:22.175
- Overkill, but thanks.

1:18:22.262 --> 1:18:23.568
- And you know what?

1:18:23.655 --> 1:18:24.612
You got a lot of
your mother in you.

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:27.615
- A lot of my dad too, recently.

1:18:27.703 --> 1:18:28.878
- Well, I'm sorry about that.

1:18:28.965 --> 1:18:30.923
[laughing]

1:18:31.010 --> 1:18:33.360
- Dad, we have to stop Olivia.

1:18:33.447 --> 1:18:34.535
I have some ideas how.

1:18:34.622 --> 1:18:37.147
- First, will you do me a favor?

1:18:38.365 --> 1:18:39.149
Yeah, come on.

1:18:42.152 --> 1:18:45.546
Can we have one more
father-daughter date?

1:18:45.633 --> 1:18:49.028
You know, without all the
politics and all that?

1:18:49.115 --> 1:18:50.421
Just you and me?

1:18:50.508 --> 1:18:52.336
- I don't know, what
are you serving?

1:18:52.423 --> 1:18:53.293
- Uh, well...

1:18:56.601 --> 1:18:58.603
- Banana split?

1:18:58.690 --> 1:18:59.691
- Yeah.
[laughs]

1:18:59.778 --> 1:19:00.736
- Cherry?

1:19:01.867 --> 1:19:02.650
- Come on.

1:19:04.696 --> 1:19:05.697
There you go.

1:19:05.784 --> 1:19:07.917
[chuckling]

1:19:09.788 --> 1:19:11.094
Ah!

1:19:11.181 --> 1:19:13.444
[laughing]

1:19:13.531 --> 1:19:16.577
[lighthearted music]

1:19:17.535 --> 1:19:19.972
[catchy music]

1:19:28.807 --> 1:19:31.767
Okay, thank you all for coming,
we need to do two things.

1:19:31.854 --> 1:19:33.420
First-
- First...

1:19:33.507 --> 1:19:35.553
We need to stop Olivia's
development plans, like pronto.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:38.295
- And then something I
should've been focusing on but-

1:19:38.382 --> 1:19:40.166
- Messed up, royally.

1:19:40.253 --> 1:19:43.517
- We need to restore
downtown, save Main Street.

1:19:43.604 --> 1:19:45.389
- Seems like a tall order,

1:19:45.476 --> 1:19:47.478
like you might need some muscle.

1:19:47.565 --> 1:19:48.609
- We just might.

1:19:48.696 --> 1:19:49.959
Okay, my dad needs some people

1:19:50.046 --> 1:19:51.699
to comb through
government websites.

1:19:51.787 --> 1:19:53.092
- Uh, we got you covered.

1:19:53.179 --> 1:19:53.876
- Ding.

1:19:53.963 --> 1:19:54.790
We'll go deep!

1:19:56.487 --> 1:19:59.620
- And then what we're gonna
need is one great lawyer.

1:20:02.101 --> 1:20:03.320
- Talk to me!

1:20:03.407 --> 1:20:04.625
[laughing]

1:20:04.712 --> 1:20:05.801
- And then one last thing.

1:20:07.672 --> 1:20:08.934
I'm sorry, guys.

1:20:09.021 --> 1:20:09.805
Forgive me?

1:20:11.894 --> 1:20:12.546
I messed up too.

1:20:14.331 --> 1:20:17.290
- Whatever happens, we're all
gonna do this together, right?

1:20:18.248 --> 1:20:19.205
Deal?

1:20:19.292 --> 1:20:20.293
- Deal.

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:21.120
All of us.

1:20:22.034 --> 1:20:24.776
[catchy music]

1:20:38.398 --> 1:20:39.791
- Ah, democracy.

1:20:39.878 --> 1:20:40.661
Just go in there and vote
for whoever you want,

1:20:40.748 --> 1:20:42.098
completely anonymous.

1:20:42.185 --> 1:20:43.273
- Yeah, no one knows
who you voted for,

1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:44.970
totally a secret.

1:20:45.057 --> 1:20:47.755
- Thank you, Mrs. Vance.
- Thank you, Mrs. Vance.

1:20:47.843 --> 1:20:48.844
Send it in.

1:20:52.717 --> 1:20:53.979
- So, as you can see,

1:20:54.066 --> 1:20:54.850
your investment
is going to create

1:20:54.937 --> 1:20:57.417
a brand new Echo Harbor.

1:20:57.504 --> 1:20:58.766
I have an idea
for a name change,

1:20:58.854 --> 1:21:00.638
re-imagined in the 21st century,

1:21:00.725 --> 1:21:03.684
a world class resort and casino.

1:21:03.771 --> 1:21:05.121
- Oh, hi.

1:21:05.208 --> 1:21:06.165
It's a party.

1:21:06.252 --> 1:21:07.732
- Oh, everyone meet Mary Parson,

1:21:07.819 --> 1:21:09.255
the future mayor of Echo Harbor.

1:21:09.342 --> 1:21:11.257
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

1:21:11.344 --> 1:21:13.477
You guys must be talking
about the new resort project.

1:21:13.564 --> 1:21:14.478
Pretty cool, right?

1:21:14.565 --> 1:21:16.132
- [Olivia] Yes!

1:21:16.219 --> 1:21:18.612
- So, I'm guessing you guys
haven't heard the bad news?

1:21:18.699 --> 1:21:19.526
- Mary...

1:21:19.613 --> 1:21:20.658
- [Man] What bad news?

1:21:20.745 --> 1:21:22.051
- There is no bad news.

1:21:22.138 --> 1:21:22.878
- Eleanor?

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:25.837
- What's this?

1:21:25.924 --> 1:21:27.839
- This is an injunction.

1:21:27.926 --> 1:21:31.712
There will be no more
construction at 16 Main,

1:21:31.799 --> 1:21:34.802
this building, and the
adjoining properties.

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:36.674
- This is a historical landmark.

1:21:36.761 --> 1:21:37.414
[chuckling]

1:21:37.501 --> 1:21:38.894
- Since when?

1:21:38.981 --> 1:21:40.286
- This building was
the first hospital

1:21:40.373 --> 1:21:42.723
for veterinary care
south of New York.

1:21:42.810 --> 1:21:43.768
- Kinda famous.

1:21:43.855 --> 1:21:45.117
Who knew?

1:21:45.204 --> 1:21:47.554
- Well, now the
Historical Society does.

1:21:47.641 --> 1:21:51.428
- Paperwork submitted by
Mayor Parson just yesterday.

1:21:51.515 --> 1:21:53.778
He rushed it right through.

1:21:53.865 --> 1:21:55.649
- I'll fight this
in court, and win.

1:21:55.736 --> 1:21:57.695
- Maybe, maybe not.

1:21:57.782 --> 1:22:02.265
Certainly not until after a
long, drawn out legal process,

1:22:02.352 --> 1:22:03.919
7-8 years?

1:22:04.006 --> 1:22:06.791
- Not to mention, the optics
aren't really on your side.

1:22:06.878 --> 1:22:10.012
- I fought the Second
World War, Your Honor,

1:22:10.099 --> 1:22:13.885
and this woman is throwing
me out on the street.

1:22:13.972 --> 1:22:16.801
- You do understand, if
you stop this project,

1:22:16.888 --> 1:22:18.455
there will be nothing and nobody

1:22:18.542 --> 1:22:21.110
to help you save this pitiful
little excuse of a town.

1:22:21.197 --> 1:22:23.112
You truly will become an echo.

1:22:23.199 --> 1:22:25.375
- Wow, low.

1:22:25.462 --> 1:22:26.898
And the second
reason why I'm here.

1:22:26.985 --> 1:22:28.204
- [Olivia] Oh, pray tell.

1:22:29.118 --> 1:22:29.814
- Mom?

1:22:29.901 --> 1:22:30.858
- Coming, honey!

1:22:33.078 --> 1:22:34.471
Fresh from the oven.

1:22:37.169 --> 1:22:38.083
You'll do great, sweetie.

1:22:38.170 --> 1:22:39.041
- Thanks.

1:22:39.128 --> 1:22:41.130
Let me just fix this.

1:22:41.217 --> 1:22:44.655
Okay, not as fancy, but some
great memories with legos.

1:22:44.742 --> 1:22:47.310
So, here's another
investment opportunity.

1:22:47.397 --> 1:22:51.749
It might help you and my pitiful
little excuse for a town?

1:22:51.836 --> 1:22:53.969
It's good to have
options, right?

1:22:54.056 --> 1:22:56.667
So, yeah, you invest a little
bit more in these businesses,

1:22:56.754 --> 1:22:57.755
and then bring them up to code,

1:22:57.842 --> 1:22:58.756
add a fresh coat of paint,

1:22:58.843 --> 1:23:00.279
and then next thing you know-

1:23:00.366 --> 1:23:02.760
- A thriving town center,
open for business.

1:23:02.847 --> 1:23:04.109
- This is ridiculous!

1:23:04.196 --> 1:23:05.893
These are sophisticated
investors,

1:23:05.981 --> 1:23:08.287
not a bunch of idiots
looking to give handouts.

1:23:08.374 --> 1:23:09.462
- Yeah, no problem.

1:23:09.549 --> 1:23:10.855
We already have investors,

1:23:10.942 --> 1:23:12.857
but just in case...

1:23:12.944 --> 1:23:14.163
Guys?

1:23:14.250 --> 1:23:15.903
- Is the whole town out there?

1:23:15.991 --> 1:23:18.906
- I convinced my mall
investors to shelf Port Byron

1:23:18.994 --> 1:23:20.299
and invest in Echo Harbor.

1:23:20.386 --> 1:23:22.171
Call it a reverse anchor.

1:23:22.258 --> 1:23:24.042
You see, tourists will
come to Echo Harbor

1:23:24.129 --> 1:23:26.305
as they always have, for
the charm, and the beauty,

1:23:26.392 --> 1:23:27.872
and the wonderful hospitality.

1:23:27.959 --> 1:23:30.005
That will be the destination.

1:23:30.092 --> 1:23:31.789
- You're throwing your
money away on this dump.

1:23:31.876 --> 1:23:33.921
- Maybe, maybe not.

1:23:34.009 --> 1:23:35.749
I mean, either way, I'm
not making any money.

1:23:35.836 --> 1:23:37.490
In fact, I'm losing money.

1:23:37.577 --> 1:23:40.015
You see, that was the
incentive for the investors.

1:23:40.102 --> 1:23:42.800
I'm giving up 100%
of my 30% interest

1:23:42.887 --> 1:23:44.628
that they can share equally.

1:23:44.715 --> 1:23:45.585
I end up with nothing.

1:23:46.673 --> 1:23:48.980
Well, that's not really true.

1:23:49.067 --> 1:23:50.503
I kind of get it all.

1:23:50.590 --> 1:23:51.635
- Where do I throw up?

1:23:53.289 --> 1:23:57.032
- Investment disbursements
are outlined in section 18,

1:23:57.119 --> 1:23:59.469
paragraph 3 of these packages.

1:24:01.123 --> 1:24:02.733
Ha.

1:24:02.820 --> 1:24:05.736
- So, we also share in the
success of an existing business

1:24:05.823 --> 1:24:06.824
once they're up and running?

1:24:06.911 --> 1:24:08.608
- Of course, it's an investment.

1:24:08.695 --> 1:24:10.741
- Plus 36% federal
rebate for the AHA,

1:24:10.828 --> 1:24:14.310
21% tax security for the
Small Business Loan Act,

1:24:14.397 --> 1:24:17.530
and the rest appreciated over
increased property valuations

1:24:17.617 --> 1:24:19.445
all outlined in appendix C.

1:24:21.099 --> 1:24:22.231
Wow, I can't believe
I just said that.

1:24:22.318 --> 1:24:23.623
- Without the cards!

1:24:23.710 --> 1:24:25.234
[laughing]

1:24:25.321 --> 1:24:26.844
- Come on, people, you
can't seriously think

1:24:26.931 --> 1:24:28.672
you're gonna make more money
with her silly little plan

1:24:28.759 --> 1:24:29.673
than my resort.

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:31.501
- If it gets built.

1:24:31.588 --> 1:24:34.243
- His shares alone boost
the return by a third.

1:24:34.330 --> 1:24:35.635
It's a no brainer, Olivia.

1:24:35.722 --> 1:24:37.072
- That's right.

1:24:37.159 --> 1:24:38.508
Have any of you ever
seen Echo Harbor?

1:24:38.595 --> 1:24:40.858
- Or tried our world
famous homemade scuffles?

1:24:42.425 --> 1:24:44.427
There's a saying on this
side of the pond, Olivia,

1:24:44.514 --> 1:24:46.081
and I think I get it now.

1:24:46.168 --> 1:24:49.997
"United we stand,
divided we fall."

1:24:50.085 --> 1:24:52.913
Kind of like that
little empire of yours.

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.002
- [Rob] All right,
guys, let's go.

1:24:55.090 --> 1:24:56.656
Ladies, gentlemen,
everyone, let's go.

1:24:56.743 --> 1:24:58.093
- Hey, sounds pretty good.

1:24:58.180 --> 1:24:59.485
- Peter, Sarah!

1:25:01.096 --> 1:25:02.053
Wait!

1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:02.923
I can explain!

1:25:04.142 --> 1:25:05.187
What just happened here?

1:25:05.274 --> 1:25:06.623
- You got your butt kicked.

1:25:06.710 --> 1:25:07.537
- Big time.

1:25:07.624 --> 1:25:08.364
- Boom!

1:25:11.236 --> 1:25:12.498
- The pressure, Will,
I can't take it,

1:25:12.585 --> 1:25:13.891
I feel like I'm
gonna short circuit.

1:25:13.978 --> 1:25:15.240
- Sit down.

1:25:15.327 --> 1:25:16.023
- Is it raining, Will?

1:25:16.111 --> 1:25:17.024
I feel wet.

1:25:17.112 --> 1:25:18.896
- No, it's not raining.

1:25:18.983 --> 1:25:19.853
Hold on, bro.

1:25:21.028 --> 1:25:22.247
Whoa, tied?

1:25:22.334 --> 1:25:23.335
- What?

1:25:23.422 --> 1:25:24.206
- Yo-
- Hey, send it, send it!

1:25:24.293 --> 1:25:25.076
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:25:25.990 --> 1:25:27.078
- Thank you so much.

1:25:27.165 --> 1:25:28.123
I think it's actually working.

1:25:28.210 --> 1:25:29.559
- Oh, God willing.

1:25:29.646 --> 1:25:30.995
- I think it already has.

1:25:31.082 --> 1:25:31.996
- Eleanor killed it.

1:25:32.083 --> 1:25:33.563
- Mad skills never age.

1:25:33.650 --> 1:25:34.868
- We already have more
than enough investors

1:25:34.955 --> 1:25:35.869
to make it work.

1:25:35.956 --> 1:25:37.523
- You just saved Echo Harbor.

1:25:37.610 --> 1:25:39.003
- We saved it.

1:25:39.090 --> 1:25:39.960
- Victory selfie?

1:25:40.047 --> 1:25:42.746
[phones buzzing]

1:25:42.833 --> 1:25:43.790
- Oh, no.

1:25:43.877 --> 1:25:44.530
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1:25:44.617 --> 1:25:46.010
- 854 to 854?

1:25:46.097 --> 1:25:48.404
- The polls are about to close.

1:25:48.491 --> 1:25:50.406
- I think somebody
forgot to vote.

1:25:54.192 --> 1:25:56.890
- Mary, where's your sticker?

1:26:02.331 --> 1:26:03.462
- Go vote.

1:26:03.549 --> 1:26:04.898
But-

1:26:04.985 --> 1:26:05.725
- And that's an order
for your father.

1:26:05.812 --> 1:26:06.726
- I'd listen to him.

1:26:06.813 --> 1:26:07.771
- And you still have time,

1:26:07.858 --> 1:26:09.120
you've got like two minutes.

1:26:09.207 --> 1:26:10.556
- We'll never make it.

1:26:10.643 --> 1:26:12.819
- Oh, yes you will.

1:26:12.906 --> 1:26:14.952
[catchy music]

1:26:15.039 --> 1:26:18.173
[tires screeching]

1:26:19.435 --> 1:26:21.132
- Woo!

1:26:21.219 --> 1:26:23.134
I could get used to this.

1:26:23.221 --> 1:26:26.050
- Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

1:26:27.834 --> 1:26:29.140
Guy, there's a guy,
there's a guy, there's a-

1:26:29.227 --> 1:26:30.489
- Watch out!

1:26:32.012 --> 1:26:32.796
- Sorry!

1:26:35.929 --> 1:26:37.627
Watch it, pothole, pothole!

1:26:37.714 --> 1:26:38.758
Stop, stop, stop!

1:26:38.845 --> 1:26:41.413
- Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:45.112
[Mary screaming]

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:46.070
- Yeah!

1:26:46.157 --> 1:26:47.158
- Jordan!

1:26:47.245 --> 1:26:49.160
- I'm sorry!
- Jordan!

1:26:52.946 --> 1:26:54.513
- Stop, slow down,
we're here, we're here!

1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:55.471
Stop!

1:26:55.558 --> 1:26:56.254
- Watch out, watch out!

1:26:56.341 --> 1:26:58.517
[screaming]

1:26:58.604 --> 1:27:01.085
- Get out, go, go!

1:27:01.172 --> 1:27:02.347
Go, Mary, go!

1:27:02.434 --> 1:27:03.479
- There you go, go, go.

1:27:03.566 --> 1:27:04.828
- Dad, I just want to say-

1:27:04.915 --> 1:27:06.003
- Go, go, hurry,
I'll get over it.

1:27:06.090 --> 1:27:06.656
Go on.

1:27:06.743 --> 1:27:07.613
Vote.

1:27:07.700 --> 1:27:08.745
- I hope she makes it.

1:27:11.617 --> 1:27:12.357
- Let's go.

1:27:14.272 --> 1:27:15.752
- I'm proud of you.

1:27:15.839 --> 1:27:17.580
I know how much being
mayor was important to you.

1:27:17.667 --> 1:27:19.190
- When Mary wins and
she's out of earshot,

1:27:19.277 --> 1:27:20.322
I'm gonna cry like a baby.

1:27:20.409 --> 1:27:21.801
- I expect nothing less.

1:27:21.888 --> 1:27:23.368
- Listen, honey.

1:27:23.455 --> 1:27:25.457
Now that Mary's gonna
be running the town,

1:27:25.544 --> 1:27:27.198
I'm gonna have some free time.

1:27:28.243 --> 1:27:30.027
Don't you think we could...

1:27:30.114 --> 1:27:31.420
- Yes?

1:27:31.507 --> 1:27:35.511
- Yes what, yes
you'll take me back?

1:27:35.598 --> 1:27:36.947
- I never let you go.

1:27:38.340 --> 1:27:39.819
- Oh.

1:27:39.906 --> 1:27:42.082
[chuckling]

1:27:46.304 --> 1:27:47.784
Oh, here she comes.

1:27:47.871 --> 1:27:48.741
- Did you make it?

1:27:48.828 --> 1:27:50.090
- Made it just in time.

1:27:50.177 --> 1:27:51.178
- I guess I should
be the first one

1:27:51.266 --> 1:27:53.006
to congratulate Miss Mayor.

1:27:55.966 --> 1:27:57.010
- Are you crying?

1:27:57.097 --> 1:27:58.751
- No, I'm not crying.

1:28:00.013 --> 1:28:02.059
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

1:28:02.146 --> 1:28:03.800
[laughing]
I don't know.

1:28:03.887 --> 1:28:06.803
I know I lost, but I feel great.

1:28:06.890 --> 1:28:08.195
I feel like a winner.

1:28:08.283 --> 1:28:09.458
- Just so you know,
you have 4 years,

1:28:09.545 --> 1:28:11.068
and then once I finish college-

1:28:11.155 --> 1:28:12.025
- Finish college?

1:28:12.112 --> 1:28:13.200
What are you talking about?

1:28:13.288 --> 1:28:14.550
- Uh, Rob?

1:28:16.116 --> 1:28:17.379
- [Man] What, really?

1:28:17.466 --> 1:28:19.555
- [Rob] She voted for me?

1:28:19.642 --> 1:28:20.730
- If you don't keep your promise

1:28:20.817 --> 1:28:21.774
and do what's right around here,

1:28:21.861 --> 1:28:23.210
I'm gonna come back from college

1:28:23.298 --> 1:28:24.777
and we can do this
little dance again,

1:28:24.864 --> 1:28:27.084
except this time,
I'll win, old man.

1:28:27.171 --> 1:28:28.041
- Oh, okay.

1:28:28.128 --> 1:28:29.391
[chuckling]

1:28:29.478 --> 1:28:30.566
- She voted for me?

1:28:32.872 --> 1:28:35.310
- I just got here and you
just figured that out?

1:28:36.398 --> 1:28:37.268
- Family photo?

1:28:37.355 --> 1:28:39.662
- All right, let's get one!

1:28:39.749 --> 1:28:40.967
Hey, where's Dad?

1:28:41.054 --> 1:28:42.404
- I'm here. [groaning]

1:28:42.491 --> 1:28:43.361
- Pops!
- Gamps.

1:28:43.448 --> 1:28:45.232
- I need to get my balance.

1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:46.233
- Get over here!

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:48.627
[laughing]

1:28:53.284 --> 1:28:54.459
- Thanks for the car, Dad.

1:28:54.546 --> 1:28:55.982
- Take care of it.
[chuckling]

1:28:56.069 --> 1:28:57.680
- All right, Jordan,
let's hit it.

1:28:57.767 --> 1:28:59.290
- Cheese!

1:28:59.377 --> 1:29:02.162
[lighthearted music]

1:29:08.255 --> 1:29:09.300
- [Rob] What?

1:29:09.387 --> 1:29:10.475
Hey!

1:29:10.562 --> 1:29:12.216
- Finally.

1:29:12.303 --> 1:29:12.999
- Aw.

1:29:13.086 --> 1:29:14.044
- Cool.
- Cool.

1:29:14.131 --> 1:29:15.915
- All right, that's enough.

1:29:16.002 --> 1:29:17.177
- Praise God!

1:29:17.264 --> 1:29:18.875
- Praise God!

1:29:18.962 --> 1:29:20.137
Ah, we'll see.

1:29:21.094 --> 1:29:22.313
We'll see.

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:25.229
[lighthearted music]

1:29:32.279 --> 1:29:34.804
- As the great Will
and Ed once said,

1:29:34.891 --> 1:29:37.241
this election really
was about choice.

1:29:37.328 --> 1:29:39.809
The choice to help others,

1:29:39.896 --> 1:29:41.201
the choice to forgive,

1:29:42.855 --> 1:29:45.815
and most importantly, the
choice to see all moments,

1:29:45.902 --> 1:29:50.080
even defeats as blessings,
and not as disappointments.

1:29:50.167 --> 1:29:52.604
I think I'm gonna
need a bigger box.

1:29:54.040 --> 1:29:55.172
Dad is actually
doing a great job

1:29:55.259 --> 1:29:56.260
revitalizing the town,

1:29:56.347 --> 1:29:58.305
almost like he's 18 again.

1:29:58.393 --> 1:30:00.307
He really wanted to
restore the music store,

1:30:00.395 --> 1:30:02.571
but had a much better idea.

1:30:02.658 --> 1:30:05.225
And Olivia Wharf-Hall Compton

1:30:05.312 --> 1:30:06.662
or whatever she calls herself,

1:30:06.749 --> 1:30:08.794
her place still sits empty.

1:30:08.881 --> 1:30:10.317
The minute I finish college,

1:30:10.405 --> 1:30:13.103
I have a plan, a big
plan for this one.

1:30:13.190 --> 1:30:16.280
[lighthearted music]

1:30:18.369 --> 1:30:21.198
And most of all,
I am happy to say,

1:30:21.285 --> 1:30:23.113
our family feels
like a family again.

1:30:24.549 --> 1:30:25.898
Of course, we still
have work to do,

1:30:25.985 --> 1:30:27.247
but what family doesn't?

1:30:29.467 --> 1:30:31.426
So, the race delayed
my trip a little,

1:30:31.513 --> 1:30:33.079
but here I am now,
better for it.

1:30:33.166 --> 1:30:34.559
And I'm so excited
about your school.

1:30:34.646 --> 1:30:35.995
I mean, California?

1:30:36.082 --> 1:30:36.909
Who wouldn't want
to be me right now?

1:30:36.996 --> 1:30:37.736
We're going to Disneyland!

1:30:37.823 --> 1:30:39.216
- I'm so excited!

1:30:39.303 --> 1:30:40.652
[laughing]

1:30:40.739 --> 1:30:42.262
About your school, excited.

1:30:42.349 --> 1:30:45.178
I mean, we're excited about
Disneyland too, you know.

1:30:45.265 --> 1:30:46.615
We're generally-
- Dad, Dad, stop.

1:30:46.702 --> 1:30:47.442
- Sorry.

1:30:47.529 --> 1:30:47.964
Isn't she amazing?

1:30:49.487 --> 1:30:51.054
- So, does that
answer your question?

1:30:51.141 --> 1:30:52.490
Sorta, kinda?

1:30:52.577 --> 1:30:54.274
- I was thinking
more along the lines

1:30:54.361 --> 1:30:56.015
of a couple of sentences.

1:30:56.102 --> 1:30:58.714
But yeah, that sounds like it
was a great life experience.

1:30:58.801 --> 1:31:01.760
[lighthearted music]

1:32:28.107 --> 1:32:30.632
[calming music]

1:33:07.494 --> 1:33:10.193
[catchy music]

1:36:03.670 --> 1:36:06.761
[lighthearted music]
