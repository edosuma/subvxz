WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:01.710
Previously on The Royals...

00:01.750 --> 00:02.449
Take a shot.

00:04.620 --> 00:06.820
You're gonna keep getting
back up, that's what you do,

00:06.889 --> 00:08.989
but I will keep putting you back down.

00:09.058 --> 00:12.459
I told you I wouldn't be the girl
waiting for you to show up, Liam,

00:12.528 --> 00:16.930
and yet here I am, waiting
for you to show up.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.732
I never asked you to.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.167
I'm not good at relationships.

00:20.236 --> 00:22.936
- I can't be in one, not with you.
- Okay.

00:23.005 --> 00:26.506
So you're gonna bury the story
about the Princess and me

00:26.575 --> 00:28.542
and in return, I'm gonna
give you a story.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.012
You're the one that crashed
Prince Robert's plane?

00:31.014 --> 00:31.813
Yeah.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.614
All the proof you need is on this drive.

00:33.682 --> 00:36.250
- Enjoying the view?
- It's lovely.

00:36.719 --> 00:39.319
Yeah, it certainly is.

00:39.388 --> 00:41.421
Your blood claim to the throne,

00:41.490 --> 00:44.391
how do you propose we deal
with that little footnote?

00:44.460 --> 00:46.159
Honestly? I don't know.

00:46.228 --> 00:48.996
Let the upper echelons
of the nation decide

00:49.064 --> 00:50.697
behind closed doors.

00:50.766 --> 00:52.799
A privy council.

00:52.868 --> 00:54.501
Following the tribunal,

00:54.570 --> 00:56.870
I expect to remain the King of England.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.306
Long live King Robert.

01:26.635 --> 01:28.769
How long have you been here for?

01:28.837 --> 01:30.570
Most of the night.

01:30.639 --> 01:32.572
And no one recognized you?

01:32.641 --> 01:36.109
No one expects the next King of England
to be sat on a bench all night,

01:36.178 --> 01:38.478
especially not the night
before the decision.

01:39.214 --> 01:42.349
You sound pretty sure about this
"next King of England" stuff.

01:42.418 --> 01:44.985
It's my birthright, my destiny.

01:45.921 --> 01:47.688
The Privy Council will see that.

01:51.727 --> 01:53.727
They're testing Big Ben.

01:53.796 --> 01:55.529
That's a good sign.

01:56.832 --> 02:00.133
I should go. I've got to
go and inherit the throne

02:00.202 --> 02:02.469
to the greatest empire the
world has ever known.

02:03.372 --> 02:04.905
Are you ready?

02:04.973 --> 02:06.973
I've been ready my entire life.

02:21.865 --> 02:24.043
â™ª

02:31.033 --> 02:32.933
All rise!

02:51.731 --> 02:54.098
Liam? Liam!

02:55.034 --> 02:57.034
- I need to talk to you.
- Not today.

02:57.103 --> 02:59.036
Brandon Boone told me
something, it's not good.

02:59.105 --> 03:00.971
First of all, hi, hello, welcome back.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.174
Second, my brother is about to be
crowned the next King of England.

03:04.243 --> 03:06.777
If you have not good news from
the guy who tried to kill him,

03:06.846 --> 03:08.679
I suggest you bury it.

03:08.748 --> 03:10.547
We need to be unified today.

03:13.285 --> 03:15.552
Speaking of not good...

03:19.492 --> 03:21.492
We need to disgrace him.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.427
We need to make it
obvious that he's unfit,

03:23.496 --> 03:25.229
while not making the family look like

03:25.297 --> 03:27.030
a traveling circus of idiots.

03:27.099 --> 03:29.399
The world sees Cyrus for what he is.

03:29.468 --> 03:31.502
It never hurts to remind them.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.170
Robbie?

03:34.073 --> 03:35.873
I want you to wear this for luck.

03:37.743 --> 03:40.177
Ooh, your sister is on to something.

03:40.246 --> 03:41.845
Ever since the Christmas address,

03:41.914 --> 03:44.348
that watch has been more
famous than you are.

03:44.416 --> 03:46.550
You should reach for it when you speak.

03:46.619 --> 03:48.685
Council will notice.

03:48.754 --> 03:50.187
They need to represent the people

03:50.256 --> 03:52.022
and the people loved Simon.

03:52.091 --> 03:55.025
- I will never be my father.
- Neither will Cyrus.

03:56.428 --> 03:59.630
Seated before us are two petitioners,

03:59.698 --> 04:01.965
each his own claim to the throne.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.767
It is our duty

04:03.836 --> 04:05.435
in the next few hours

04:05.504 --> 04:07.604
to decide between them,

04:07.673 --> 04:10.240
informing the world which will be

04:10.309 --> 04:16.313
from this day forward the
one true King of England.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.615
At midnight,

04:18.684 --> 04:22.219
if the euphonious tones
of Big Ben ring out,

04:22.288 --> 04:24.388
we shall have a new king.

04:24.456 --> 04:27.891
Should the moment pass in silence,

04:27.960 --> 04:31.929
our current king will
remain the sovereign ruler

04:31.997 --> 04:34.498
of this United Kingdom.

04:35.201 --> 04:38.869
I remind you that this
is not a court of law,

04:38.938 --> 04:40.838
it is a council of equity.

04:41.203 --> 04:42.736
Are the claimants...

04:43.576 --> 04:45.275
..ready to speak?

04:47.146 --> 04:49.279
Hey!

04:49.348 --> 04:51.248
I wanna talk to you.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.353
- Hi.
- Hi?

04:56.422 --> 04:59.122
"Hi"? That's what you're going with?

04:59.191 --> 05:01.859
- It's really good to see you.
- Where the hell did you go?

05:01.927 --> 05:05.262
I had some stuff I had to take care of.
The less you know, the better.

05:05.331 --> 05:07.331
I've been sitting in silence...

05:08.721 --> 05:10.688
..wondering what the hell I did wrong.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.404
Texting you like a pathetic
loser, crying every night

05:14.473 --> 05:17.241
and you just show up like
nothing even happened.

05:17.309 --> 05:19.743
I'm so sorry.

05:19.812 --> 05:21.979
Apology not accepted.

05:23.765 --> 05:25.932
I'm so done with this shit.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.268
You be sorry, Jasper. You enjoy that.

05:29.336 --> 05:31.703
- Hey. - Rosie...
- You need to step away.

05:31.772 --> 05:34.584
- Helena, please, Len...
- You need to step away now!

05:36.898 --> 05:38.858
What are you gonna do? Are
you gonna shoot me, honey?

05:38.860 --> 05:40.663
Call me "Honey" again, I am.

05:40.718 --> 05:44.233
You'd better make sure your safety's
off because, I assure you, mine is.

05:50.030 --> 05:52.798
If you do shoot him, aim for the heart.

05:53.968 --> 05:55.901
He already broke mine.

05:59.212 --> 06:02.295
That's the last time you ever aim your
weapon at me and live to tell about it.

06:10.947 --> 06:12.924
The file came from your computer.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.167
Our digital forensics team verified it.

06:18.736 --> 06:19.806
It wasn't me.

06:19.808 --> 06:21.675
It looks like it was.

06:22.142 --> 06:25.040
Dave, how long have we known each other?

06:25.109 --> 06:27.075
30 years?

06:27.767 --> 06:29.204
I'm telling you it wasn't me.

06:29.314 --> 06:31.314
I'm telling you that won't matter.

06:31.383 --> 06:33.750
The file was classified
and it's been leaked.

06:40.859 --> 06:45.028
- What am I looking at, Dave?
- Dismissal, prosecution...

06:45.097 --> 06:48.899
Possibly 15 years,
reducible to half that.

06:50.102 --> 06:51.902
You have to give me a name, Jim.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.905
Do you remember anything
that can help us?

06:54.973 --> 06:57.507
'I remember
everything about it.'

06:57.576 --> 07:03.180
How could I forget the moment I learned
my dear nephew Robert was alive?

07:03.248 --> 07:08.418
The moment I saw his
face, I was so overcome,

07:08.487 --> 07:12.189
my eyes became bleary
and I needed a drink.

07:12.257 --> 07:17.194
It was I who gently revealed
the passing of his father

07:17.262 --> 07:21.164
and encouraged him to reach out
if he needed to talk about it.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.401
Daddy's dead.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.636
Discuss.

07:26.705 --> 07:30.674
So I want to make it clear that I
never considered this a competition.

07:31.777 --> 07:36.613
I love Robbie and he'll make
a wonderful king one day,

07:36.682 --> 07:38.949
but that day is not today.

07:39.852 --> 07:42.419
I am the leader of this nation.

07:43.355 --> 07:47.457
And when my dear,
departed brother Simon...

07:48.460 --> 07:50.193
..was taken from us,

07:50.262 --> 07:56.199
even Queen Helena supported
my reign over her own son's.

07:57.136 --> 07:59.269
She knows it's true.

07:59.338 --> 08:02.005
'It's all my fault.'

08:02.074 --> 08:04.407
I helped Cyrus change
the course of history

08:04.476 --> 08:06.409
and not for the better.

08:06.478 --> 08:08.979
What were you looking for
when you made that pact?

08:09.915 --> 08:11.648
What did you need from him?

08:11.717 --> 08:13.750
Control.

08:13.819 --> 08:16.920
Perhaps power, but certainly control.

08:17.990 --> 08:22.425
The ability to run the monarchy and
this family exactly as I saw fit.

08:22.494 --> 08:24.361
And now?

08:25.631 --> 08:29.132
Now I am tired.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.736
Now I have Robert.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.707
I have a place in Wyoming.

08:37.775 --> 08:39.943
A few thousand acres of land

08:40.011 --> 08:43.246
that are so immaculate it'll
take your breath away.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.683
How would you like to spend
some time with me there?

08:47.786 --> 08:49.753
We can leave tomorrow night.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.621
- Tomorrow night?
- Mm-hm?

08:51.690 --> 08:53.990
The night they announce the next king?

08:54.059 --> 08:57.761
Possibly the culmination of my
life's work, grooming Robert?

08:57.830 --> 09:00.897
Tomorrow night at midnight, one
of two things is gonna happen.

09:00.966 --> 09:04.601
Cyrus will remain King and will do
whatever the hell he wants to do,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.603
or Robert will be King.

09:07.639 --> 09:10.140
You'll have trained him
since the day he was born.

09:10.876 --> 09:13.176
There'll be a coronation to plan.

09:13.245 --> 09:15.378
Helena, you're the Queen.

09:15.447 --> 09:17.647
There will always be something.

09:19.885 --> 09:22.185
So, when that clock strikes midnight,

09:22.254 --> 09:25.956
perhaps the best place for you to
be is 30,000 feet above it all.

09:27.893 --> 09:30.026
Come with me.

09:30.095 --> 09:32.062
If you can let go tomorrow,

09:32.130 --> 09:35.065
you'll have truly found the
control you're chasing.

09:38.503 --> 09:40.237
I'll think about it.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.007
You're kind of persuasive, Mr. Parker.

09:44.076 --> 09:45.809
Especially with things that I want

09:45.878 --> 09:48.945
or, in this case, desperately want.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.816
'No one has desperately
wanted this as much as I have.'

09:52.885 --> 09:56.286
To rule this kingdom,
to lead this country.

09:56.355 --> 09:59.055
But let me be absolutely clear.

09:59.124 --> 10:01.791
Since the beginning of time,

10:01.860 --> 10:04.661
a privy council has never
removed a sitting king

10:04.730 --> 10:10.467
on the grounds that the Crown Prince
has returned from parts unknown

10:10.535 --> 10:12.802
and asked for a do-over.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.639
It simply isn't done.

10:16.508 --> 10:20.043
And without our rules
and our traditions,

10:20.112 --> 10:21.811
what are we?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.547
America?

10:24.616 --> 10:28.985
You saw what happened with
Trump versus Hillary.

10:29.054 --> 10:30.921
Lose-lose.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.958
This is my crown.

10:35.027 --> 10:37.360
This is my reign.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.429
History supports me.

10:39.498 --> 10:41.598
Tradition supports me.

10:42.501 --> 10:45.035
I know you will too.

10:45.103 --> 10:49.172
To take the crown from me would
be nothing short of stealing.

10:49.241 --> 10:52.075
'You stole it, didn't
you?' 'Stole what?'

10:52.144 --> 10:54.010
I was woken up in the
middle of the night

10:54.079 --> 10:56.880
and interrogated for hours
about a missing file

10:56.949 --> 10:58.815
that you took... why?

10:58.884 --> 10:59.910
Do they know I took it?

10:59.912 --> 11:02.053
No, they don't know.
They think I took it.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.287
- Why did you take it?
- I needed proof...

11:05.157 --> 11:06.990
..about Boone.

11:07.059 --> 11:09.092
A journalist knew about
me, so I traded stories

11:09.161 --> 11:11.628
- to protect the Princess.
- To protect yourself.

11:11.697 --> 11:13.730
Well, I hope that works
out well for you,

11:13.799 --> 11:15.398
'cause I'm going to prison

11:16.935 --> 11:18.969
and my daughter is going to that
orphanage that you claim to be from.

11:19.037 --> 11:21.738
- I'll tell them I did it.
- I'll tell them you did it,

11:21.807 --> 11:23.873
but I'm still gonna lose my job.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.777
I understand that your
father was a disappointment,

11:27.846 --> 11:30.113
but your inability to trust anyone

11:30.182 --> 11:32.649
or ask anyone for help has
hurt a lot of people.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.452
Including my daughter.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.253
You might want to think about that.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.789
- It can't be fixed?
- No.

11:39.858 --> 11:41.825
No, not this time.

11:47.299 --> 11:50.500
- Hey.
- Hey. Are you ready to go?

11:50.569 --> 11:53.169
Nearly. Can I talk to you a moment?

11:53.238 --> 11:55.405
I need a favor.

11:55.474 --> 11:57.774
At today's hearing, they
may ask you to speak

11:57.843 --> 12:01.344
but, if they don't, I'm
going to suggest it.

12:01.413 --> 12:04.381
- I'll say I support you.
- And I appreciate that.

12:04.449 --> 12:07.183
But I also think you
should denigrate Cyrus,

12:07.252 --> 12:11.054
talk about his drug use, mention
his cancer, his erratic behavior.

12:11.123 --> 12:12.919
Hell, make something up if you have to.

12:12.921 --> 12:14.888
You really think that's necessary?

12:16.028 --> 12:18.061
Unfortunately, I do.

12:18.130 --> 12:21.031
If it comes from me, it'll
play as negative campaigning.

12:21.099 --> 12:23.833
Besides, it's not like Cyrus
has been a model of virtue.

12:23.902 --> 12:25.301
But why stoop to his level?

12:25.370 --> 12:28.304
The people see your nobility
and they appreciate it.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.373
The Privy Council will too.

12:30.442 --> 12:33.576
Remind them how great our
country is and can be.

12:33.645 --> 12:35.945
Tell them that everyone
should have a chance.

12:36.014 --> 12:38.148
We're England. We can
be great and majestic.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.016
Remind them of that. Inspire them.

12:40.085 --> 12:42.285
That's what they want from a king.

12:43.522 --> 12:46.756
I love you, brother, but
you're being naive.

12:46.825 --> 12:50.493
We need to do whatever we
can to secure the crown.

12:50.562 --> 12:54.230
Your job is to vilify Cyrus.
You need to trash him, okay?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.600
Look, trust me on this, please.

12:59.109 --> 13:01.642
I'm counting on you, little brother.

13:11.195 --> 13:14.085
You're the Queen of England. You
can run, but you can't hide.

13:16.084 --> 13:18.852
Jack's invited me to his
ranch for the weekend.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.756
Oh, Jack Parker stepping up! Ooh!

13:24.608 --> 13:26.542
Packing kind of light, aren't we?

13:26.610 --> 13:29.144
It's not as though you're
gonna need many clothes.

13:30.047 --> 13:32.915
The tree does not grow far
from the apple, Mummy.

13:32.983 --> 13:34.883
I haven't decided if I'm going yet.

13:34.952 --> 13:36.819
Why wouldn't you?

13:36.887 --> 13:40.088
There's a thing today where they
pick the next King of England.

13:40.157 --> 13:43.158
Which is completely out of your hands.

13:43.227 --> 13:44.526
Go.

13:44.595 --> 13:46.261
Hm.

13:46.330 --> 13:47.729
Go!

13:55.272 --> 13:57.005
Psst!

13:57.074 --> 13:58.774
For God's sake!

13:58.843 --> 14:00.642
Inappropriate!

14:01.312 --> 14:03.111
I need your help.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.647
It seems you're running out
of lives, Mr. Whiskers.

14:05.716 --> 14:09.084
I gave some confidential
information to a reporter.

14:09.153 --> 14:10.552
About what?

14:10.621 --> 14:13.088
Robert's plane crash. It's a long story.

14:13.157 --> 14:16.792
Now James Hill's in the line of fire and
I was hoping that you could intervene.

14:16.861 --> 14:18.260
Let me get this straight.

14:19.830 --> 14:22.998
You steal from me, breach the security
of this family, let alone the country,

14:23.067 --> 14:24.733
and then ask me for help.

14:24.802 --> 14:26.301
Well, essentially, yes.

14:27.972 --> 14:30.973
I'm beginning to see why my daughter is
at her wits' end with you, Bodyguard.

14:31.842 --> 14:34.943
You understand, if I intervene on Mr.
Hill's behalf,

14:35.012 --> 14:37.346
I'll be pointing fingers at Mr. Frost.

14:37.848 --> 14:39.681
I do, yes.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.450
Then why don't you think about it?

14:41.519 --> 14:44.119
See if any other course
of action comes to mind.

14:45.356 --> 14:48.790
As far as my son's plane
crash is concerned...

14:48.859 --> 14:52.661
Robert would already be king
if he hadn't gone missing,

14:52.730 --> 14:54.530
serving his country,

14:54.598 --> 14:59.902
if he hadn't been mercilessly
attacked and left for dead.

14:59.970 --> 15:02.137
Our current King is trying
to make it look like

15:02.206 --> 15:04.273
Robert is trying to change history

15:04.341 --> 15:08.243
based on a loophole, or a technicality.

15:08.312 --> 15:12.614
In fact, it's Cyrus who is the loophole.

15:12.683 --> 15:15.951
He's King merely because of

15:16.020 --> 15:19.454
a very unfortunate technicality.

15:20.524 --> 15:25.494
And to not make things
right is to concede that

15:25.563 --> 15:29.765
the man who murdered Simon
and tried to murder Robert

15:29.833 --> 15:34.570
has once again been allowed
to attack this family...

15:35.539 --> 15:37.272
..and get away with it.

15:38.108 --> 15:43.712
You have the ability
to put things right,

15:44.448 --> 15:49.718
to reach down into hell and
send a message to Mr. Pryce:

15:49.787 --> 15:52.254
"You don't win!

15:52.323 --> 15:55.657
You don't get to change
this part of history.

15:56.660 --> 16:00.696
You might have taken our
last great king from us,

16:00.764 --> 16:05.000
but you will not take our
next great king from us."

16:05.069 --> 16:07.202
Send a message.

16:08.038 --> 16:11.239
Do the just and honest thing.

16:12.443 --> 16:14.977
Make it right.

16:25.356 --> 16:27.022
My name is Jasper Frost.

16:28.492 --> 16:30.425
I'm His Royal Highness' Prince Liam
Henstridge's responsible security detail

16:30.494 --> 16:32.728
and I'm the person who
leaked those documents.

16:32.796 --> 16:34.563
Mr. Hill had absolutely no part in it,

16:34.632 --> 16:36.531
nor was he negligent in any way.

16:38.235 --> 16:40.035
His only mistake, if any, was trusting me
and expecting me to do the right thing.

16:43.907 --> 16:45.674
Take Mr. Frost into custody.

16:51.548 --> 16:54.316
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.252
Mr. Frost was working for me
under my direct instructions.

16:57.321 --> 16:59.955
There was no breach and thus no crime.

17:00.758 --> 17:05.460
With all due respect, that seems
difficult to believe, Your Highness.

17:05.529 --> 17:10.432
Does it? The Privy Council is about to
meet to decide who will be your next king

17:10.501 --> 17:12.467
and your boss.

17:12.536 --> 17:15.037
Call me crazy but, selfishly,
I'd like that to be me.

17:15.105 --> 17:18.040
The timing of this article
would work in my favor,

17:18.108 --> 17:21.576
not only reminding the people
and the Council what I endured,

17:21.645 --> 17:24.179
but why I'm not sat on the
throne at this moment.

17:24.248 --> 17:27.049
I asked the man who
solved my father's murder

17:27.117 --> 17:29.551
to help me tell that story.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.521
With apologies to Mr. Hill,
I asked him to tell no one.

17:34.458 --> 17:39.494
He's not a traitor, gentlemen,
he's a hero. Uncuff him.

17:41.165 --> 17:43.398
Uncuff him, for God's sake!

17:47.671 --> 17:50.305
I appreciate your service, gentlemen,

17:50.374 --> 17:54.142
and I'll be happy to talk to anyone
who needs more clarification.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.611
You'll likely have to
do that, Your Highness.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.047
I'll see you out.

18:13.530 --> 18:15.931
Was any of that true?

18:19.470 --> 18:21.436
I should've stayed a detective.

18:21.505 --> 18:23.205
I'm so sorry, James.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.540
I never meant to cause you
or Sara Alice any harm.

18:25.609 --> 18:27.175
Well, you did.

18:27.244 --> 18:29.277
- I understand.
- I don't think you do.

18:29.346 --> 18:31.279
You're fired.

18:31.348 --> 18:35.050
Place your gun on the table and
I'll escort you off the premises.

18:36.253 --> 18:38.620
Put it on the table!

18:39.957 --> 18:41.957
You know I love her, don't you?

18:42.025 --> 18:44.025
I've always known that,

18:44.094 --> 18:46.561
but I'm afraid that's
not enough this time.

18:47.531 --> 18:50.057
Is there anything I can
do to change your mind?

18:50.059 --> 18:50.900
There was.

18:50.968 --> 18:52.934
You could've trusted me.

19:02.613 --> 19:05.714
You can watch me on the monitors.
I know the way out.

19:05.783 --> 19:08.083
Tell Sara Alice I said goodbye.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.853
I'm gonna miss her.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.689
Before I speak, I think...

19:21.829 --> 19:23.905
It's only fair to give my siblings

19:23.907 --> 19:26.207
to voice their support or concerns.

19:26.276 --> 19:28.743
So I humbly defer to my brother,

19:28.811 --> 19:30.778
His Royal Highness Prince Liam,

19:30.847 --> 19:33.814
whose opinion matters to me immensely,

19:33.883 --> 19:35.650
as it should to you too.

19:37.587 --> 19:40.421
Prince Liam, as your
brother has suggested,

19:40.490 --> 19:41.889
would you like to share with us

19:41.958 --> 19:44.258
your perspective on these proceedings?

19:55.438 --> 19:57.004
Cyrus?

20:00.777 --> 20:02.410
What do you want?

20:02.478 --> 20:04.645
Nothing.

20:04.714 --> 20:07.214
What's he planning,
anyway, your brother?

20:10.520 --> 20:12.920
- He's planning to tell the truth.
- The truth!

20:12.989 --> 20:15.389
He'll never know what it's like.

20:16.559 --> 20:20.761
When you're the first-born
son, the crown is inevitable.

20:22.298 --> 20:24.329
It's only now that he's
gotten a small taste

20:24.392 --> 20:26.564
of what you and I have always known...

20:27.437 --> 20:30.571
the possibility of life
without the crown.

20:31.507 --> 20:37.111
I wonder how he'll behave in
this moment of uncertainty.

20:38.815 --> 20:44.151
Not before the world, but
behind closed doors.

20:45.121 --> 20:49.790
People are at their best, or worst,

20:49.859 --> 20:52.827
when they have an opportunity
to touch greatness.

20:54.764 --> 20:56.897
I should know.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.767
I've been both.

20:59.836 --> 21:01.836
Mostly worst.

21:01.904 --> 21:04.305
Runs in the family.

21:06.409 --> 21:08.576
Liam?

21:08.644 --> 21:11.012
I have full-blown cancer...

21:12.081 --> 21:15.316
..and these have been the
greatest days of my life...

21:17.353 --> 21:19.553
..in case you wondered what it's like.

21:23.026 --> 21:26.360
I humbly defer to the
wisdom of the Council.

21:33.736 --> 21:36.037
- Are you kidding me?
- Princess Eleanor...

21:39.442 --> 21:41.942
The man has a mohawk.

21:42.011 --> 21:46.280
The King of England has
a ferret on his head.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.718
He canceled the dedication
of my father's monument

21:50.787 --> 21:53.220
and then drove his car
through it, drunk.

21:53.289 --> 21:57.324
A few weeks ago, he knighted a
whore in the Red State Room.

21:57.393 --> 21:59.060
Dame Sinnamon of Skankville.

21:59.128 --> 22:01.128
Baroness Saffron.

22:01.197 --> 22:06.200
One candidate is noble, is
inspiring and the best of us

22:06.269 --> 22:09.437
while the other is a
malicious freak show

22:09.505 --> 22:13.007
dressed as a court
jester on nitrous oxide.

22:13.076 --> 22:15.209
That's my perspective, just so you know.

22:15.278 --> 22:17.478
You certainly have a point of view.

22:17.547 --> 22:21.082
Yeah, that
one turned out okay.

22:21.150 --> 22:23.918
I personally like this one better.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.855
You would.

22:28.624 --> 22:30.791
Mm-hm.

22:30.860 --> 22:32.860
Nice drugs.

22:32.929 --> 22:35.196
I don't do them much these days,

22:35.264 --> 22:38.566
I just keep them around in case of
emergency, or if guests pop in, obviously.

22:38.634 --> 22:40.234
Help yourself.

22:41.471 --> 22:44.038
No. I've got a shipment coming
in from Morocco soon. I'm good.

22:44.107 --> 22:45.739
Oh, do you?

22:46.976 --> 22:49.844
So, I want to talk to you
about my latest project.

22:49.912 --> 22:54.048
My family owns quite a bit of coastal
real estate all over the world.

22:54.117 --> 22:56.584
Most of these properties
are empty and a bit faded,

22:56.652 --> 23:00.688
so I plan to restyle and rebrand
them as boutique hotels.

23:01.090 --> 23:03.791
Like the Chateau Marmont's
way cooler little brother.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.460
- Ooh, or little sister.
- Or little sister.

23:07.530 --> 23:10.531
Which brings me to you.
I want you to style.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.234
You have impeccable taste,
I've already seen your work

23:13.302 --> 23:15.669
and quite frankly, you need
to keep busy, otherwise...

23:15.738 --> 23:18.139
- I could do all that from here?
- No.

23:18.207 --> 23:19.974
We'd be on the road the next six months.

23:20.042 --> 23:22.409
Sebastian, I can't be
gone for six months.

23:22.478 --> 23:23.329
Why not?

23:23.331 --> 23:25.881
Because in case you didn't
know, I'm a princess.

23:25.948 --> 23:29.150
You'd still be a princess. Give me one
good reason why you have to be here.

23:29.218 --> 23:31.252
I do things.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.022
- Charities and I...
- You do drugs in your room.

23:35.091 --> 23:37.057
As far as charities go,

23:37.126 --> 23:40.427
we can donate a portion of every
booking to whatever charity you like.

23:41.831 --> 23:44.899
Six months, a different
city every month.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.567
You doing what you do best.

23:46.636 --> 23:49.603
You can hide in your room and
call it your obligation,

23:49.672 --> 23:51.672
but your fire?

23:51.741 --> 23:55.276
Your fire is meant to be
shared with the world.

23:56.612 --> 23:59.246
Think about it.

24:03.986 --> 24:08.422
Your Highness, I wanted to thank you

24:08.491 --> 24:11.058
for keeping me out of prison.

24:11.127 --> 24:13.127
I owe you one for tracking Ted Pryce.

24:13.196 --> 24:14.962
You let me use the family gym for that.

24:15.031 --> 24:17.531
True, so I guess you owe me one.

24:18.434 --> 24:20.834
Well, I'm afraid it's
my last day on the job.

24:21.737 --> 24:26.373
I've been relieved of my position,
which is... not exactly a surprise,

24:26.442 --> 24:28.042
given the circumstances.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.578
I have a feeling you won't
be unemployed for long.

24:30.646 --> 24:33.323
As a matter of fact,
this makes things easier.

24:33.325 --> 24:34.216
How so?

24:34.283 --> 24:37.518
When I'm elected King, I want
the best security detail.

24:37.587 --> 24:39.587
That happens to be you.

24:39.655 --> 24:43.290
Rather than take you from my brother, I
can simply re-employ you. Count on that.

24:43.359 --> 24:45.292
- Why would you do that?
- I just told you.

24:45.361 --> 24:47.328
I want the best.

24:47.396 --> 24:49.396
One small caveat, though.

24:49.465 --> 24:53.267
You have to keep your
extra-curricular affairs in check.

24:54.270 --> 24:58.105
- You mean the Princess?
- I mean that very one.

24:59.809 --> 25:03.477
Time has a way of making
things right, Mr. Frost.

25:03.546 --> 25:06.080
Dedicate yourself to protecting me

25:06.148 --> 25:10.484
and I will always protect
you, even with her.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.387
I'll think about it.

25:14.757 --> 25:16.757
Good luck.

25:19.328 --> 25:21.462
Jasper?

25:21.530 --> 25:23.564
If those bells chime at midnight,

25:23.633 --> 25:25.566
you're back in the game.

25:28.304 --> 25:31.238
I promised myself I
wouldn't covet things.

25:32.275 --> 25:36.243
If I survived, if I was
rescued, I would be thankful

25:36.312 --> 25:38.679
for everything that I have and have had.

25:38.748 --> 25:43.083
The truth is... my time away
made me a better person.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.053
When you're surrounded by silence

25:46.122 --> 25:48.055
for the first time in your life,

25:48.124 --> 25:50.658
you learn to appreciate
the life you once had,

25:50.726 --> 25:54.328
the people that you may have
once taken for granted.

25:54.397 --> 25:57.765
So I consider my time on
the island a blessing,

25:57.833 --> 25:59.199
not a tragedy.

26:00.670 --> 26:04.004
My only wish is that I had found my
way home before my father was killed.

26:08.077 --> 26:09.877
But let's not dwell on the past.

26:09.945 --> 26:14.882
Let's use this opportunity to focus
on the goodness that is England.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.117
Glorious, noble England.

26:17.186 --> 26:19.353
The fairest region on Earth.

26:20.256 --> 26:22.289
Let's focus on its people.

26:22.358 --> 26:26.193
Not just one person, not
a king, but all people,

26:26.262 --> 26:29.096
working together, a kingdom united,

26:29.165 --> 26:34.935
without restriction to the happiness, to
the prosperity and glory of Great Britain.

26:36.405 --> 26:39.206
We, all of us, have made mistakes.

26:39.552 --> 26:41.552
After all, we are simply human

26:41.554 --> 26:43.554
and alone, we are fallible,

26:43.622 --> 26:47.131
but together, we are strong.

26:47.226 --> 26:49.192
We are united.

26:49.261 --> 26:52.362
The strength of our
parliament, our democracy,

26:52.431 --> 26:56.933
of this very Privy Council who
represents the voice of the people,

26:57.002 --> 26:59.402
will make the right decision.

26:59.471 --> 27:01.738
I know it in my heart.

27:02.741 --> 27:05.041
And whatever decision you make,

27:05.110 --> 27:07.878
as a citizen of this great nation,

27:07.946 --> 27:11.848
I vow to be the best
man I can possibly be.

27:11.917 --> 27:13.850
King or not.

27:13.919 --> 27:18.855
I will do my utmost to
make this country a region

27:18.924 --> 27:22.025
where all persons have a duty

27:22.094 --> 27:25.462
and all people have a chance.

27:26.431 --> 27:28.698
We are England.

27:28.767 --> 27:32.569
Great, majestic England

27:32.638 --> 27:37.240
and together, our majesty is infinite.

27:38.291 --> 27:41.091
God save the King.

27:55.069 --> 27:56.413
All rise!

28:06.714 --> 28:11.417
We are advisors to the Sovereign
of the United Kingdom.

28:11.485 --> 28:15.620
On this day, however, let history record

28:15.689 --> 28:20.091
that we will select the
Sovereign we will next serve.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.194
At midnight, if Big Ben remains silent,

28:23.263 --> 28:27.365
His Majesty King Cyrus
will remain in power.

28:27.434 --> 28:31.102
But, if the great bell chimes,

28:31.171 --> 28:35.707
then we will, with great
felicity, dedicate ourselves

28:35.776 --> 28:39.878
to the stewardship of His
Royal Highness Prince Robert.

28:39.947 --> 28:44.482
For now, we adjourn until
the hour strikes 12.

28:45.285 --> 28:47.452
God save the King!

28:47.521 --> 28:49.788
God save the King!

28:49.856 --> 28:52.591
We need to talk. What the hell was that?

28:52.659 --> 28:54.659
- You're welcome.
- I'm welcome?

28:54.728 --> 28:57.495
My idiot brother may have cost
me the throne and I'm welcome?

28:58.565 --> 29:01.566
I asked you to do one simple thing.

29:01.635 --> 29:03.535
You asked me to do one stupid thing...

29:04.471 --> 29:08.206
- ..and I fixed it for you.
- You fixed it how?

29:09.943 --> 29:12.277
I protected our family's image...

29:12.346 --> 29:15.847
so that there might actually
be a throne for you to sit on.

29:16.984 --> 29:21.119
That is until Len did your
bidding, as she always does.

29:21.188 --> 29:23.855
Len did the right thing.
She actually helped us.

29:23.924 --> 29:27.626
You, on the other hand, lost your nerve
and your balls, like you always do.

29:27.694 --> 29:30.028
People are at their best or their worst

29:30.097 --> 29:33.365
when they have an opportunity
to touch greatness.

29:34.568 --> 29:36.668
I think we know which one you are.

29:38.438 --> 29:40.572
I have to be at my worst, Liam,

29:40.641 --> 29:43.775
because no one gives you anything.

29:43.844 --> 29:46.544
At least not a place on the
greatest throne on Earth.

29:46.613 --> 29:51.149
Crowns are for taking and
I am taking this one.

29:52.252 --> 29:54.919
That is unless you've screwed
it up for all of us.

30:00.293 --> 30:02.127
Mum?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.467
I couldn't do it.

30:09.536 --> 30:12.470
- There's still time.
- No.

30:12.539 --> 30:14.539
My life is here.

30:14.608 --> 30:16.408
My identity is here.

30:17.344 --> 30:20.512
The time when I could slip away

30:20.580 --> 30:24.416
and be someone else is long since past.

30:24.484 --> 30:26.518
I have a good life.

30:26.586 --> 30:29.754
I have a wonderful, fairy-tale life.

30:29.823 --> 30:31.956
But...

30:32.025 --> 30:34.259
It does come with certain restrictions.

30:36.496 --> 30:38.596
Perhaps if I were younger...

30:39.866 --> 30:42.100
..maybe things could've been different.

30:42.169 --> 30:44.135
Oh, Mum.

30:56.783 --> 30:58.183
Liam?

31:00.654 --> 31:01.853
Hi.

31:03.190 --> 31:07.058
I er... I took the liberty of typing
up some social media messages

31:07.127 --> 31:09.194
you can post at midnight.

31:09.262 --> 31:11.796
There's one for each outcome.

31:11.865 --> 31:16.201
I also think it's important you have a
presence tomorrow online, no matter what.

31:17.070 --> 31:20.605
I know neither outcome is what
you want or once imagined,

31:20.674 --> 31:23.475
but people still care
about your point of view.

31:23.543 --> 31:25.310
And so do I.

31:26.246 --> 31:28.246
Willow?

31:29.850 --> 31:31.983
It's been a long day.

31:32.052 --> 31:33.818
Would you like to just hang for a bit?

31:34.755 --> 31:38.189
I think it's better if we keep
things professional from now on.

31:39.893 --> 31:42.026
I'm sorry.

32:35.448 --> 32:37.415
It's 11:59, Your Majesty.

32:37.484 --> 32:39.450
Good luck.

32:50.463 --> 32:54.966
They'll do the right thing.
They have to.

32:55.035 --> 32:58.069
It was so clear today to everyone...

32:58.138 --> 33:01.506
If they don't, if they pick
Cyrus, we can fight it.

33:01.575 --> 33:05.143
No. If they pick Cyrus, it's done.

33:05.212 --> 33:07.111
We've done what we can.

33:07.180 --> 33:09.914
- Son?
- Whatever happens next is history.

33:10.851 --> 33:13.952
After that, natural order
will run its course.

33:19.293 --> 33:21.527
15 seconds.

33:39.011 --> 33:40.445
It's time.

34:05.672 --> 34:07.639
Kathryn!

34:41.992 --> 34:44.259
'It's official. Prince Robert...'

34:54.935 --> 34:56.333
Hi.

35:05.342 --> 35:08.176
I'm sorry I'm so late.
It's crazy out there.

35:08.245 --> 35:10.078
It's okay, it's fine.

35:10.147 --> 35:13.081
- I dunno why I'm crying.
- Do you want to go out, celebrate?

35:13.150 --> 35:15.750
I found these.

35:20.290 --> 35:22.957
I love you. You know that.

35:30.801 --> 35:33.134
Or we could just stay in.

35:33.203 --> 35:35.603
You could have amazing sex
with the King of England.

35:36.506 --> 35:38.273
Yeah.

35:38.341 --> 35:40.408
Let's do that.

36:05.969 --> 36:08.002
What did you do?

36:09.372 --> 36:10.872
I did what I could.

36:10.941 --> 36:12.807
What you did was drink my bourbon,

36:12.876 --> 36:15.176
defile a whore in my bed

36:15.245 --> 36:18.146
and then betray me and
take away my crown.

36:18.215 --> 36:21.583
I only have one vote, Your Highness.

36:21.651 --> 36:23.451
Your Majesty!

36:23.520 --> 36:26.921
I told you, you had to
win it in the room.

36:26.990 --> 36:29.190
You told me you could
manipulate the council.

36:29.259 --> 36:31.059
You told me you could convince them,

36:31.127 --> 36:36.731
so you look me in the eye, you
ridiculous nappy-wearing fool,

36:36.800 --> 36:39.133
and tell me what the...
just happened here!

36:52.849 --> 36:58.553
We saw a king today and it wasn't you.

36:58.622 --> 37:00.722
I'm gonna kill you, Westcott.

37:00.790 --> 37:03.725
I'm gonna torture you and kill you

37:03.793 --> 37:07.362
and defile your pathetic, little corpse.

37:07.430 --> 37:09.163
You don't decide shit!

37:09.232 --> 37:11.132
You don't tell me a goddamn thing!

37:11.201 --> 37:15.403
I'm the King of England and
you're all just people.

37:16.373 --> 37:18.673
I'm sorry.

37:19.576 --> 37:21.242
I did what I could.

37:30.153 --> 37:32.553
You simply think it's over for me.

37:33.623 --> 37:35.790
It's over for you.

37:35.859 --> 37:40.361
All of you, with your
birthrights and your titles

37:40.430 --> 37:43.164
and your esteemed sense of privilege.

37:43.233 --> 37:46.334
You had a king who let you be corrupt

37:46.403 --> 37:48.169
and you destroyed that.

37:48.972 --> 37:52.273
You think Robert's gonna
let you be that way?

37:52.342 --> 37:54.342
He won't.

37:54.411 --> 37:56.377
It's over.

37:56.446 --> 37:59.213
Good luck being old and common,

37:59.282 --> 38:02.183
you stupid son of a bitch.

38:31.081 --> 38:32.914
Hey.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.353
I'm not supposed to be here,

38:39.661 --> 38:41.861
but I wanted to come and see you, because
I need to try and explain myself.

38:41.864 --> 38:44.398
Don't bother. I don't want you to.

38:45.462 --> 38:47.628
I got fired today...

38:48.798 --> 38:52.033
..because I took a file
of classified information

38:52.102 --> 38:54.569
and I gave it to a reporter.

38:54.637 --> 38:58.373
I did that because the reporter knew
about my past and I was trying...

38:58.441 --> 39:00.375
I'm leaving soon.

39:01.678 --> 39:04.012
After the coronation.

39:04.981 --> 39:07.415
I'm gonna be someone
more than a princess.

39:09.486 --> 39:12.286
I'm leaving this behind, including you.

39:14.324 --> 39:17.191
I'm trying to tell you that I
did what I did to protect you.

39:17.260 --> 39:20.928
It doesn't matter. Truly,
it doesn't matter.

39:22.332 --> 39:25.833
I can't do this any more, any of it.

39:25.902 --> 39:28.436
I don't want to and I'm not going to.

39:30.273 --> 39:31.706
When?

39:34.444 --> 39:38.780
I have a chance to be someone, Jasper...

39:41.151 --> 39:43.251
..to get away from all of this.

39:46.289 --> 39:48.456
Please walk away.

40:00.070 --> 40:03.037
Fine. If you won't, then I will.

41:06.569 --> 41:08.669
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.373
I just wanted to let you know in person

41:12.442 --> 41:14.976
that I'm not your
security detail any more.

41:15.044 --> 41:16.978
We'll see about that.

41:18.047 --> 41:22.717
Before the council hearings, you said you
heard something from Boone. Bad news.

41:22.785 --> 41:24.785
I thought you were letting all that go?

41:24.854 --> 41:27.922
I was then. I'm not now.
Was it about Robert?

41:30.193 --> 41:33.561
- Then it's important I know.
- Okay.

41:34.964 --> 41:38.499
But, once you hear it,
there's no going back.

41:39.335 --> 41:40.935
I'm okay with that.

41:41.004 --> 41:42.970
Besides, I have no place to go back to.

41:44.807 --> 41:47.408
What did Boone say about Robert?
