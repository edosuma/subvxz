WEBVTT

00:04.430 --> 00:05.510
What's this?

00:05.570 --> 00:07.219
I didn't put that there!
That isn't mine.

00:07.260 --> 00:09.956
How did my Iavwer
work out for you?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.739
Easy job defending
an innocent man.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.610
Yet here you are,
on their side.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.480
I don't know who's
side I'm on.

00:15.530 --> 00:18.055
Frankie DiCarlo has ties to know
fascist sympathizers.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.797
If Marco's guilty of
anything, it's loving this
country too much.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.922
Then prove it,
get close to him.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.451
Betty- How long before you tell
him the truth; he doesn't even
know your real name.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.028
What do you want me tell him;
that my father was a crazy
street preacher.

00:33.070 --> 00:35.595
Will you have children
with this man?

00:35.640 --> 00:39.986
What world will you raise
them in? It can't work.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.167
You've got some big secret?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.940
You're not my old lady
all of a sudden.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.945
I've heard some good things
about you, Moretti.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.958
Win back some of that self
respect they bled out of you.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.959
What kind of device
are you looking for?

01:05.540 --> 01:07.235
It's a shame,

01:07.280 --> 01:09.919
how they shut down
your dad's business.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.971
Left it to rot.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.284
What'd you get us into, Frankie?

01:14.330 --> 01:15.979
We're making a statement,

01:16.030 --> 01:18.282
Civil Defiance.

01:18.330 --> 01:22.505
Make the government
bastards think twice
about pushing us around.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.643
Just sick of being treated
like we don't belong here.

01:25.690 --> 01:28.204
Nothing's gonna change
unless we push.

01:31.780 --> 01:34.089
I told Mahoney,

01:34.130 --> 01:37.600
I'll only build the device once
I know what the target is.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.094
No one gets hurt,
you got me Frankie.

01:40.140 --> 01:40.913
I'll make sure.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.130
I mean it.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.353
We're in this together.

01:50.840 --> 01:54.230
You are in, yeah?

01:54.280 --> 01:57.010
I said I'd do it.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.150
I will.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.689
Look, Gladys, there's
Arla Ross.

02:12.740 --> 02:15.083
I wonder if she's here
with Tom Junior.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.564
Now there's a man
you should meet.

02:28.100 --> 02:31.092
Mr. Parry.
Good evening.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.974
Miss Witham. Didn't take you
for a Tchaikovslq buff.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.978
My mother and I are fans
of Sir Ernest MacMillan.

02:40.020 --> 02:43.672
I look forward to the entire
season under his baton.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.507
We're basking in more than
one peer of the realm.

02:46.550 --> 02:49.678
The Governor General is visiting
Victory Munitions this week.

02:49.730 --> 02:51.778
Yes, I read that
in the paper.

02:51.820 --> 02:53.424
With the offensive in
North Africa,

02:53.470 --> 02:57.645
he's doing rounds on behalf of
His Majesty to keep spirits up.

02:57.690 --> 03:01.990
Our new G.G. is big news
around here, he's the
Earl of Athlone

03:02.050 --> 03:04.610
and even a minor royal
causes a stir.

03:04.660 --> 03:07.390
But isn't an earl
old-hat to a Londoner?

03:07.440 --> 03:10.910
Not when the Earl is the
King's uncle.

03:10.970 --> 03:16.146
We can't have agitators on
the loose around members
of the Royal Family.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.268
And by agitator,

03:20.330 --> 03:22.673
you mean Marco Moretti?

03:22.720 --> 03:26.417
I'm afraid his
time has run out.

03:26.460 --> 03:28.064
Come to my office first thing.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.544
If your fascist friend is going
to lead us to bigger fish,

03:31.600 --> 03:34.239
we need to reel them in
and make some arrests.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.167
Marco is not a lost cause.

03:37.210 --> 03:38.814
IfI had a little more time -

03:38.870 --> 03:40.212
You don't.

03:40.260 --> 03:42.125
Enjoy the concert.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.356
Betty- Someone's gone and raided
their magazine rack.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.186
Just think, The
Governor General's coming here.

03:59.230 --> 04:00.663
Yeah, Earl Whatchamahooey.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.144
I saw the King and Queen
when they came before the war.

04:03.190 --> 04:06.102
Jumpin', Vera, how long you been
collecting wedding magazines?

04:06.150 --> 04:09.677
A while, you know just in case.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.188
How go the big wedding plans?

04:12.250 --> 04:14.468
We're thinking of a
quickie at City Hall.

04:14.510 --> 04:15.852
Is Ivan enlisting?

04:15.900 --> 04:17.333
No, he can't. Asthma.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.462
We just want to keep it simple.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.684
Then after, we'll take the
train out to Winnipeg for a big
Ukrainian Christmas.

04:23.740 --> 04:26.868
Your honeymoon is Winnipeg?
In winter?

04:26.910 --> 04:30.789
That's our Kate.
Fairy-tale romance.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.742
Well who you got
standing up for you?

04:33.790 --> 04:38.136
Oh, I don't know...

04:38.190 --> 04:41.660
I guess... Betty?

04:41.710 --> 04:46.625
Awww... sure, yeah.

04:46.670 --> 04:50.140
Well...
See you inside.

04:52.420 --> 04:57.028
Oh that girl needs a bridal
shower in the worst way.

04:57.070 --> 05:00.073
Since you're now maid of
honour...

05:00.120 --> 05:01.724
What? I'm on the hook?

05:01.770 --> 05:03.294
Mmm-hmm. Yup!

05:05.340 --> 05:09.253
Me in charge of a hen party?
That would be the worst way.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.439
With the Governor General
arrIVIng In three days,

05:11.480 --> 05:13.084
the plant is tightening
security protocol.

05:13.130 --> 05:16.258
Some workers need to
update their passes.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.919
Hey, hot stuff!

05:25.970 --> 05:27.574
Iw don't! You know
I'm ticklish!

05:27.630 --> 05:29.313
Who's this_ Gabe
you're writing?

05:29.370 --> 05:30.268
Just give it back.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.457
Are you writing some guy?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.149
It's only a card, alright?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.282
I can see that. Who is it?

05:36.330 --> 05:38.890
It's my little
brother. Gabriel.

05:38.940 --> 05:40.248
In North Bay?

05:40.290 --> 05:42.155
I told you, he lives
with my aunt.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.632
It's his birthday coming up.

05:43.690 --> 05:46.648
His last name, how come it's
Rowley, instead of Andrews?

05:46.690 --> 05:48.555
It's my aunt's name.

05:48.600 --> 05:53.515
North Bay's not big, it's
just easier on the boys.

05:53.570 --> 05:54.901
Please?

05:58.440 --> 06:01.307
Well, happy
birthday, Gabe.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.836
Marco tried to enlist, he
wanted to serve his country.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.314
I helped you send
him down this road

06:09.360 --> 06:11.408
because you told me it
would lead somewhere.

06:15.630 --> 06:17.621
The man with him is
Alfred Mahoney,

06:17.680 --> 06:20.285
a known fascist agitator.

06:20.330 --> 06:23.413
He fled the country to avoid
arrest when the war broke out.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.983
And now he's back.

06:25.030 --> 06:26.759
Have you ever seen
him before?

06:26.820 --> 06:27.889
No.

06:27.950 --> 06:31.204
Has Moretti ever
mentioned him?

06:31.260 --> 06:34.559
You're sure?

06:34.610 --> 06:36.953
What's this about?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.649
Don't worry, Marco.
It's just routine.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.123
You're a good man,
don't let them get to you.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.307
Marco have said
some overheated things,

06:43.350 --> 06:45.568
but using him to
get to this fellow -

06:45.620 --> 06:48.180
Mahoney faces charges of
seditious conspiracy.

06:48.230 --> 06:50.403
He has a li_st_of
felony conVIctlons

06:50.450 --> 06:54.090
and is wanted in
connection with at least
two beating deaths.

06:57.540 --> 07:01.886
This is the type of model
citizen with whom your
friend chooses to associate.

07:01.940 --> 07:08.152
As an enemy alien, we could
arrest him just for being
in the back of that car.

07:09.770 --> 07:13.297
Moretti is an explosives
expert with security
clearance.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.071
He is only at liberty in the
hope he leads us to Mahoney.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.518
So tell me...

07:18.560 --> 07:21.120
Do you know what they
discussed in that car?

07:21.170 --> 07:22.478
No.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.080
Have you any idea what
Mahoney wants him to do?

07:25.140 --> 07:27.301
No.

07:27.350 --> 07:30.831
All right then.
Your job is done.

07:34.010 --> 07:36.968
What, you're firing me?

07:37.020 --> 07:39.409
We prefer the term
"standing down".

07:39.450 --> 07:43.147
The arrival of the Governor
General has tied my hands.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.236
If we can panic
Moretti or DiCarlo,

07:45.290 --> 07:47.417
maybe they'll
recontact Mahoney.

07:47.460 --> 07:48.939
If not?

07:48.990 --> 07:52.812
This time tomorrow, both DiCarlo
and Moretti go to prison.

07:59.870 --> 08:03.169
Miss Burr, report to
the ID photographer.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.255
What for?

08:04.300 --> 08:06.348
Oh, ours is not to reason why.

08:06.390 --> 08:07.345
Over here.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.869
It's all the changing
hair-colours.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.047
Too many gals going
cordite blond.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.959
Our Governor General,
the Earl of Athlone,

08:22.020 --> 08:25.012
was actually born Prince
Alexander of Teck.

08:25.060 --> 08:28.496
Unfortunately, Teck happens to
be a little part of Germany,

08:28.550 --> 08:30.802
so he had to give
up that title.

08:30.850 --> 08:34.195
Anyway, he is married to
Princess Alice,

08:34.250 --> 08:37.629
the sister of King George V;
the old King George...

08:37.690 --> 08:41.114
Sorry, got held up getting
my new pass.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.427
What's she doing at my desk?

08:46.480 --> 08:49.472
Seems someone's off the
high-security project.

08:49.520 --> 08:55.481
You've been demoted_back
to general secretarial.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.350
Mr. Aikins!!!!

08:57.400 --> 08:59.960
Vera, I have umpteen things
on my mind with the

09:00.010 --> 09:01.443
Governor General coming.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.401
One of them better explain why
I got chucked off my desk!

09:03.450 --> 09:05.406
Your security clearance
was downgraded.

09:05.450 --> 09:07.498
Why?

09:07.540 --> 09:11.328
Well, ifI was a betting
man, I'd say it had to do
with the company you keep.

09:11.370 --> 09:15.249
I hear the girls clucking
about you and Marco Moretti.

09:15.290 --> 09:16.541
What difference does it make?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.410
Marco was no smuggler.

09:18.470 --> 09:21.849
Seems he's still turning
heads with security.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.368
Now pull yourself together
and get upstairs.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.917
Miss McRae.

09:40.970 --> 09:43.268
They've asked for a
display to show the range

09:43.320 --> 09:45.402
of our firepower to the
Governor General.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.406
I trust you can represent
Blue Shift?

09:47.450 --> 09:48.701
Betty- Me?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.182
Betty - Mrs.Corbett,

09:50.240 --> 09:52.879
you sure I'm the buffed-up
type you shove at royalty?

09:52.940 --> 09:56.319
I have every
confidence in you.

09:56.370 --> 10:02.502
I think Mr. Aikins,
may want a word?

10:02.550 --> 10:04.336
Thank you.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
Betty- Guess who's
meeting flippin' royalty.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.385
They'll love you, Bets.

10:14.430 --> 10:17.991
From now on, I'm
keeping my pinkie up
when I pour the amatol.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.225
Marco. Where you
been lately?

10:23.270 --> 10:24.749
Same place I
always been. You?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.655
Got any tips on
royalty, Moretti?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.314
Let's see you curtsey.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.057
I'm not big on bowing and
scraping like some around here.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.658
Whoa. What's
happening up there?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.109
More gabbing about
the Earl, I bet.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.369
Another search. What gives?

10:43.420 --> 10:46.332
They're headed for
the change-rooms.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.506
My guess?

10:47.550 --> 10:49.370
Precautions for the
Governor General.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.513
Lorna- You have a minute?

10:59.570 --> 11:00.912
Not really.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.565
Did you want something?

11:03.610 --> 11:05.566
How are you keeping?

11:09.970 --> 11:13.406
I tried calling.

11:13.450 --> 11:17.659
Your father's coming home
from Uncle Ty's and...

11:17.720 --> 11:20.359
he'll be missing you.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.549
Sheila, must you chomp gum?

11:22.590 --> 11:24.763
Yes, Mom, I must.

11:24.810 --> 11:28.246
Your father, I know he'd love
to see you tonight.

11:28.290 --> 11:29.541
I'm working a double.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.421
Well, when can you come by?

11:32.470 --> 11:34.506
He's been away two months and

11:34.560 --> 11:37.427
I think it's important we
talk a few things through.

11:37.470 --> 11:39.813
By a few things, do you mean
Dr. Patel?

11:39.870 --> 11:45.308
I didn't want to burden your
father with this business over
the phone long-distance.

11:45.350 --> 11:48.001
_This business?
Is mine, Mom. Not yours.

11:48.050 --> 11:50.518
You think you have all the
answers, don't you.

11:50.570 --> 11:55.052
No. I just have my answers.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.708
Frankie, something's up.
I don't know what.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.149
Just tell the guy we're
lying low awhile.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.248
Too late. I heard from him,
Marco.

12:10.290 --> 12:10.984
And what?

12:11.030 --> 12:12.725
What's he want us to do?

12:12.770 --> 12:15.330
Not on the phone.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.984
[Dial-tone]

12:28.350 --> 12:31.308
Bob? Are you home?

12:31.350 --> 12:34.524
Front room.

12:34.570 --> 12:36.003
Oh my goodness...

12:36.050 --> 12:39.406
You made it_home safe and
sound and In one piece...

12:43.630 --> 12:45.621
Hello, old girl.

12:49.590 --> 12:50.807
Stay there.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.429
Bloody hell...

13:05.480 --> 13:07.823
It's okay, I got you.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.030
I wanted you to see.

13:09.090 --> 13:10.341
I did.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.393
Bob! This is... unbelievable.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.998
I won't lie to you.

13:15.050 --> 13:18.702
What you've seen is
about all I can do.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.481
God... I missed you.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.701
I missed you too.

13:28.110 --> 13:31.409
Now please, will you
sit yourself down.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.358
Yeah, okay.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.060
Frankie— It's set to blow when
the Govenor General visits.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.543
Mahoney wants something bigger,
we don't get a choice.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.544
No.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.283
We're not blowing
up the factory.

13:42.340 --> 13:44.069
We're knocking out VicMu's
power station.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.337
It's separate from
the plant.

13:45.380 --> 13:46.381
He's frickin' nuts.

13:46.430 --> 13:47.556
No one will be hurt.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.034
It goes down wrong,
it set off sparks?

13:50.090 --> 13:50.602
It won't...

13:50.650 --> 13:51.958
How do you know?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.309
It'll close the factory a
few days, maybe a week.

13:54.350 --> 13:55.829
A bomb plant down
in wartime?

13:55.870 --> 13:57.394
I didn't sign up for this.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.169
So what did you sign up for?

13:59.220 --> 14:00.960
To make a change.
This is treason.

14:01.010 --> 14:02.523
Those guys in Niagara Falls?

14:02.580 --> 14:06.220
They got caught just planning
to blow up a power plant.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.793
They got the chair!

14:07.840 --> 14:11.492
You know me. I wouldn't say
this if it weren't true.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.974
There's no way out.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.669
I'm not doing it.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.632
Mahoney's not gonna let
us walk away, not knowing
what we know.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.716
He"s gonna come after
us, our families.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.499
Jeeze, Frankie...

14:22.550 --> 14:23.767
We're like brothers.

14:23.810 --> 14:25.505
We see this through. Together.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.289
[Knock at the door]

14:36.350 --> 14:37.123
Vera?

14:37.180 --> 14:39.603
We need to talk.

14:39.660 --> 14:40.957
Vera- Alone.

14:45.140 --> 14:47.608
With all the young bucks
overseas,

14:47.660 --> 14:52.404
nobody left to farm but
old men and gimps.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.406
And by day they worked
us like beggars.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.589
At night we slept like
the dead.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.804
And I loved it.

14:59.850 --> 15:01.329
How have you been?

15:01.370 --> 15:02.974
Oh, I'm fine.

15:05.990 --> 15:10.427
But Bob,

15:10.470 --> 15:15.248
Sheila's found herself a beau.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.734
Well it's about time,
I was starting to worry.

15:17.780 --> 15:21.341
It's that brown doctor.
The one she brought home.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.561
Patel.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.520
How far has it gone?

15:27.570 --> 15:30.573
She's serious.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.440
But...

15:32.490 --> 15:37.143
He's engaged to another
girl back in India.

15:43.020 --> 15:45.978
What are we going to do?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.502
Alright.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.209
Now what have I done?

15:54.250 --> 15:56.070
I want to thank you...

15:56.120 --> 15:59.601
for coming into my life and
making such a mess of it.

15:59.650 --> 16:00.685
How?

16:00.740 --> 16:01.820
Name one thing.

16:01.870 --> 16:03.906
I got demoted today
because of you!

16:03.960 --> 16:06.087
Demoted?
That's has nothing
to do with me.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.654
Of course it's you.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.009
You and whatever stupidity
you got yourself involved in.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.358
It's dragging me down too.

16:11.400 --> 16:17.669
Well, then stay the
hell away from me, Vera.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.702
I always knew you'd
make a fool of me.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.923
Gladys was right about you.

16:23.980 --> 16:27.416
You and DiCarlo and
this whole rotten mess.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.018
What the hell does she know?

16:29.070 --> 16:31.630
No idea.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.638
But she's awful chummy with
our head of security, so...

16:34.680 --> 16:36.420
you add it up.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.123
That satin'd look
pretty on you.

16:50.180 --> 16:54.002
City Hall's no place
for a fancy dress.

16:54.050 --> 16:56.518
Is that what you want?

16:56.580 --> 17:00.050
You must've played
here-comes—the-bride
when you were a kid.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.228
Wrapped up in a bed-sheet,
doily on your head?

17:03.280 --> 17:06.363
Not really.

17:06.410 --> 17:07.752
Well, I did.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.449
You?

17:09.500 --> 17:12.845
Yeah, I grew up on a farm,
Kate, not Mars.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.199
I played bride,
same as any girl.

17:16.250 --> 17:20.152
I never played much of anything.

17:20.210 --> 17:23.680
I just remember long,
hot prayer meetings,

17:23.730 --> 17:27.860
itchy collars, and
tent revivals.

17:30.480 --> 17:35.008
Hope I'm not interrupting
any girl-talk or
wedding whatnot...

17:35.050 --> 17:36.563
Don't be silly!

17:45.150 --> 17:46.959
Okey-dokee.

17:47.020 --> 17:50.979
Don't forget, thin walls.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.939
I did something for us.

17:55.980 --> 17:58.767
Well, look at you,
all man-of-the-house.

17:58.810 --> 18:00.152
I wrote your brothers.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.725
Told them they should come
down for the wedding.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.556
Why?

18:04.600 --> 18:07.592
They're just little boys,
it won't make any
difference to them.

18:07.650 --> 18:11.427
Yeah but it should for you.
For us.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.948
Ivan, I love my brothers,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.696
but it's too complicated,
getting them down here.

18:16.740 --> 18:19.470
Besides it's just a
City Hall ceremony.

18:19.530 --> 18:24.615
So, we get hitched and we pick
'em up on our way to Winnipeg.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.925
North Bay, train goes
right through it.

18:27.970 --> 18:31.622
They're family, Kate.
Your family.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.059
And it's up to me
to invite them.

18:34.110 --> 18:37.580
It's our wedding.
You can't say no.

18:46.510 --> 18:47.943
You're an adult.

18:47.990 --> 18:50.515
And whatever mistakes your
mother and I may have made

18:50.560 --> 18:53.472
to get you this
far, we made 'em.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.559
From now on, the
mistakes are your own.

18:57.610 --> 19:01.865
Dad. I can't talk
about this now.

19:01.920 --> 19:02.739
Well when, Sheila?

19:02.790 --> 19:04.394
What's she want me to do?

19:04.440 --> 19:06.783
Quit school and move back home?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.523
I'm not fourteen.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.616
She knows that.
Give her some credit.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.922
She doesn't understand
what it's like for me.

19:12.970 --> 19:17.407
And she never will,
until you start talking.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.623
C'mon make things
right with her.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.718
Welcome home, Mr. Corbett.

19:27.770 --> 19:32.116
The fresh air seems to
have agreed with you.

19:46.530 --> 19:48.259
[Knock at the door]

19:50.710 --> 19:52.268
[Knock at the door]

19:53.710 --> 19:54.222
Marco?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.531
I'm on my way...

19:55.580 --> 19:57.536
The hell are you doing
in my business?

19:57.580 --> 19:59.229
Marco, I... what are you...

19:59.280 --> 20:03.546
Would you just
quit lying to me?!

20:03.590 --> 20:06.366
What d'you know about
Frankie DiCarlo?

20:06.420 --> 20:07.978
Whatcha been feeding
Clifford Parry?!

20:08.030 --> 20:10.021
Marco? You need to leave...

20:11.070 --> 20:13.459
Give me that phone.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.593
You pretend to be my
friend, to wanna help me.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.335
Why? What's the point?

20:19.390 --> 20:21.688
What's going on?
What's wrong with you?

20:21.740 --> 20:24.254
I went to your house, Marco,
I saw the pamphlet there.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.038
What?

20:25.090 --> 20:26.307
The fascist propaganda?

20:26.350 --> 20:27.999
So that's what you told Parry?

20:28.050 --> 20:29.563
About a stupid pamphlet?

20:29.610 --> 20:32.522
Where'd you get that?
Frank DiCarlo?

20:32.570 --> 20:34.709
Me and Frankie,
we were altar boys.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.617
We'd play in the basement
of the Sons of Italy.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.535
You don't know him.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.798
Frankie's who you were
with the night you beat up
the Witham's driver?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.626
Sei pazza. Crazy...

20:43.670 --> 20:46.138
You gonna try and tell
me you didn't hit him?

20:46.200 --> 20:48.282
I trusted you! I let you in!

20:48.330 --> 20:49.934
You met my family!

20:49.980 --> 20:54.064
You saw what they did
to my dad in Petawawa,
what they did to me?

20:54.120 --> 20:56.725
And you go squealing
to the police?

20:56.770 --> 20:57.725
You...

20:57.770 --> 20:59.294
[Knock at the door]

20:59.340 --> 21:02.992
Miss Witham? Is everything all
right in there?

21:08.650 --> 21:10.698
Miss Witham?

21:13.620 --> 21:16.703
Yes. Yes, I'm fine,
I'm here with a friend.

21:30.940 --> 21:33.761
I'm in so much trouble.

21:39.730 --> 21:43.336
You need to talk
to the police.

21:43.380 --> 21:46.076
I can't do that, not to Frankie.

21:46.130 --> 21:46.949
Marco.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.083
I won't sell out my friend.

21:50.130 --> 21:51.825
Let me help you.

21:51.870 --> 21:54.782
You can't fix this.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.047
Nobody can.

21:56.090 --> 21:59.048
Let me try.

21:59.100 --> 22:02.228
Stay clear of me.

22:02.270 --> 22:03.703
For your own good.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.537
Just stay clear.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.196
Looking good.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.026
What can I do for you, Regina?

22:20.070 --> 22:20.889
Me?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.988
I'm just on my way to work.

22:23.030 --> 22:26.113
But there is someone
here to see you.

22:30.470 --> 22:31.641
Dr. Patel.

22:31.690 --> 22:33.510
I hate to arrive unannounced.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.959
Then why did you?

22:35.000 --> 22:38.527
I was out walking, hoping to
get my thoughts straight.

22:38.570 --> 22:42.483
I hope you got 'em all in
a line, 'cause I gotta get to
the newstand.

22:42.530 --> 22:44.225
I hadn't realized you could...

22:44.270 --> 22:46.579
I can't.

22:46.620 --> 22:49.919
I can barely support my weight
with the one leg, and the other
one is completely useless.

22:49.970 --> 22:51.961
Ankylosis, I gather?

22:52.020 --> 22:53.624
From a bad bout of shelling?

22:53.670 --> 22:56.844
Most folks think that
I broke my back.

22:56.890 --> 22:59.199
Most folks can't see what I can.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.582
What's that?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.710
The field of orthopedics
has changed a great deal.

23:02.770 --> 23:04.544
New therapies have emerged...

23:04.600 --> 23:07.467
You here to examine me doctor?

23:07.510 --> 23:09.501
No sir.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.381
Mr.Corbett, I am genuinely
fond of your daugther.

23:12.430 --> 23:14.034
Stop listen.

23:14.080 --> 23:18.039
Son, I don't care if
you're brown, white, or
blue with spots.

23:18.090 --> 23:20.308
You're leading Sheila
down the garden path.

23:20.350 --> 23:21.863
I've never misled her.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.960
Well then, you're lying to that
girl back where you're from.

23:27.010 --> 23:31.959
Believe me, I understand war
separation, men being men.

23:32.010 --> 23:36.106
But I am not going to accept
anyone who uses my daughter

23:36.150 --> 23:38.618
as their just-for-now girl.

23:38.670 --> 23:39.238
You hear me?

23:39.280 --> 23:40.622
Yes sir.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.581
So I don't need to tell
you what you're going to do.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.449
Excuse me.

23:48.330 --> 23:49.592
Your legs, sir.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.858
That story isn't over.

24:04.570 --> 24:08.267
[Reminder that blue shift's
decorating committee will meet
at the canteen.]

24:10.530 --> 24:12.578
I don't give a damn
about Moretti!

24:12.620 --> 24:15.669
We've made him distrustful,
we've turned him paranoid -

24:15.710 --> 24:17.666
Mahoney's determined to
disrupt the war effort

24:17.710 --> 24:19.666
at a cost of hundreds of lives.

24:19.710 --> 24:23.146
I won't lose sleep
over one casualty.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.542
You've seen his file.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.808
Raised in a pro-fascist
household.

24:26.850 --> 24:29.501
He's made inflammatory
statements to police,

24:29.550 --> 24:30.369
to co-workers,

24:30.420 --> 24:32.547
to our agent at Petawawa.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.558
We knew that with enough rope,
he'd eventually hang himself.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.591
And that's exactly
what he's done.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.517
Who can blame him, after
what happened to his father?

24:40.560 --> 24:42.608
Read it again.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.515
A neighbour informed
on his father.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.949
Some fellow named Ed.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.345
Comes a time,
you'll wish you knew less.

25:07.110 --> 25:08.589
Don't drop it.

25:08.630 --> 25:10.063
You can breathe, Matron.

25:10.110 --> 25:12.101
There's no explosives
in these babies.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.720
Well, one never
knows for sure.

25:14.770 --> 25:17.728
Hey Vere, I got the
shower invites.

25:17.770 --> 25:21.558
Well, get 'em in the mail.
Gals need them by Saturday.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.648
You feel like helping me?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.476
You're the maid of honour.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.033
You're the one
said you'd help.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.433
Someone throwing a party?

25:29.480 --> 25:33.735
Oh. Um... Just a bridal
shower for Andrews,

25:33.790 --> 25:35.655
hush-hush and all that.

25:35.700 --> 25:41.741
Ah. Of course.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.667
We were just getting the
shower invites out.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.621
That's why you
haven't got yours.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.750
I wasn't fishing.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.849
No! Kate wants you there.

25:50.890 --> 25:53.358
You're top of her list!

25:53.420 --> 25:55.320
Said you're like a
second mother.

25:55.370 --> 25:57.895
And who wouldn't want her
mother at a shower, yeah?

25:57.940 --> 25:59.669
I suppose.

25:59.730 --> 26:01.630
When is it?

26:01.690 --> 26:04.591
Next Saturday. After shift.

26:18.180 --> 26:19.693
Ed?

26:19.750 --> 26:22.708
E.D. Oh good Lord.

26:35.370 --> 26:37.713
Your loops are all
different depths.

26:37.770 --> 26:40.671
Cool your engines. Let me
get the bloody things up

26:40.720 --> 26:41.766
then we'll adjust after.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.721
Miss Burr, royalty is coming.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.421
So long as I'm in charge
of this reception,

26:46.470 --> 26:49.849
your usual slapdash
effort will not do.

26:54.870 --> 26:56.644
Vera, what's gotten
into you?

26:56.700 --> 26:59.260
I am so sick of that
bee with an itch!

26:59.310 --> 27:02.689
You're upset and it's
not about Carol.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.877
What do you want now,
Gladys?

27:04.920 --> 27:07.650
I need you to tell me
where Marco is.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.928
You tell anyone who
wants to know,

27:09.970 --> 27:11.835
Marco and I are through.

27:11.890 --> 27:14.757
Vera, you don't want to
turn your back on him.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.051
Let me help.

27:16.110 --> 27:19.455
You know where he is?

27:19.500 --> 27:22.674
Why do I still care
about that jerk?

27:22.720 --> 27:24.506
I need my head examined.

27:24.550 --> 27:26.802
Vera, where is he?

27:46.830 --> 27:53.178
Marco! Marco!
Marco, it's Gladys!

27:53.230 --> 27:55.403
Marco.

27:55.450 --> 27:56.838
What?

27:56.890 --> 27:58.448
Vera had a hunch you'd be at
your father's old factory.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.797
She wants to help.

27:59.850 --> 28:01.715
And so do I.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.800
I've been a lousy friend.

28:08.860 --> 28:10.202
Police reports.

28:10.250 --> 28:11.854
How did you get these?

28:11.900 --> 28:14.334
They're from the night
your father was arrested.

28:14.380 --> 28:19.738
Marco, the bulk of the
evidence against your
father came from one man.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.815
"Ed..."

28:20.870 --> 28:22.952
Your father had some
lousy friends too.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.820
My father doesn't know
anyone named Ed.

28:24.870 --> 28:25.950
They're initials.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.433
Enzo DiCarlo.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.390
Frankie's father.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.260
No”.no”.no".

28:30.310 --> 28:31.652
Think about it.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.439
Frankie's father ran the
same business your dad did,

28:33.490 --> 28:34.798
he was in the same club.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.740
Why lock up one man
and not the other?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.483
They rounded up everybody.

28:38.540 --> 28:41.532
Who they took, who they
left behind? It was random,
Gladys!

28:41.580 --> 28:45.710
No, it's not as
random as you think.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.102
They interviewed Frankie too.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.024
Frankie?

28:48.070 --> 28:48.968
Marco.

28:49.030 --> 28:50.759
This "friend"
you're protecting,

28:50.810 --> 28:52.892
he helped put your dad away.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.158
"He loves Italy not Canada."

29:08.000 --> 29:09.786
I got your note.

29:09.830 --> 29:10.694
Come in.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.395
I hope you'll accept
a peace offering.

29:15.440 --> 29:20.139
Lanart-Drolet 1932.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.351
I'll put this on ice for later.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.795
First, we have some business.

29:31.630 --> 29:34.417
Clifford Parry?
Meet Marco Moretti.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.641
Gladys?

29:42.690 --> 29:44.772
You told me to
find another way.

29:47.390 --> 29:50.211
The point was for him to
lead us to Mahoney.

29:50.260 --> 29:51.602
He can.

29:51.650 --> 29:53.914
He's coming forward freely.
Marco could've run.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.871
I know you don't care about me.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.524
I care about winning
this war.

29:57.570 --> 30:00.175
So do I.

30:00.230 --> 30:03.609
I never wanted it
to go this way.

30:07.280 --> 30:10.363
Give him the chance
to clear his name.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.729
What the hell did you
say to Narendra?

30:22.770 --> 30:25.773
You know? I'm at a real good
point in my book right now.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.424
Something happen
between you two?

30:27.470 --> 30:29.381
Oh and wouldn't
you like that?

30:29.430 --> 30:31.341
Sheila, I only want
what's best for you.

30:31.390 --> 30:32.869
I talked to Dr. Patel...

30:32.910 --> 30:34.639
Why don't you mind
your own business?

30:34.700 --> 30:36.383
Don't you speak back to...

30:36.440 --> 30:38.954
There's a difference between
speaking back and speaking up.

30:39.010 --> 30:42.138
I am sorry if your father
threw cold water all over
your love-nest...

30:42.180 --> 30:44.182
I didn't throw a thing.

30:44.230 --> 30:47.870
Narendra cabled his parents

30:47.930 --> 30:51.184
to call off his engagement.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.492
Bob. What did you
say to him?

30:53.540 --> 30:55.451
Nothing about that!

30:58.420 --> 31:01.412
Why are you crying?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.246
Didn't you want him
to choose you?

31:03.290 --> 31:05.076
Yes!

31:05.120 --> 31:08.908
But not because you
forced him to!

31:08.950 --> 31:11.202
Stop mothering me.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.249
Live your own life.

31:22.530 --> 31:28.002
"Our nations ammunition
output has never been greater
than it is today.

31:28.060 --> 31:32.349
Canada now produces more
explosives in six months

31:32.410 --> 31:34.799
than the entire Great War."

31:34.840 --> 31:36.102
Betty?

31:36.150 --> 31:38.402
"VicMu's production alone..."

31:38.460 --> 31:39.848
Sorry. You busy?

31:39.890 --> 31:42.199
Naw, I'm only practising the
biggest speech of my life.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.151
It's about Kate.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.895
Something's off.

31:45.940 --> 31:49.239
I've never met somebody so torn
up about her family before.

31:49.290 --> 31:50.689
What happened?

31:54.520 --> 31:56.465
The way I see it.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.603
Our Kate never once felt loved.

31:59.650 --> 32:02.118
Till you, Ivy.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.989
That's where you come in.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.488
We in business?

32:24.020 --> 32:28.377
The device is set for when
the Governor General gives
his speech at two.

32:28.420 --> 32:30.593
Where's Mahoney?

32:30.640 --> 32:32.335
He'll be here.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.371
And not happy about it,
my friend.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.421
I don't care.

32:36.470 --> 32:39.121
I want us both in the back
of Mahoney's car,

32:39.170 --> 32:41.388
heading for the border
before it blows.

32:41.430 --> 32:43.603
He thinks you don't trust him.

32:43.650 --> 32:45.641
I don't.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.565
I left a letter naming names.

32:47.610 --> 32:51.489
Once he gets us south of
Buffalo, I phone a friend.

32:51.530 --> 32:54.488
If he doesn't receive my call,
the letter gets delivered.

32:54.530 --> 32:58.057
If we take the fall for this,
we fall together.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.660
You have no clue what
Mahoney could do to us.

33:02.710 --> 33:05.019
This is not a game
you want to play.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.979
People!

33:08.020 --> 33:09.362
The Earl of Athlone

33:09.420 --> 33:12.981
and his consort her Royal
Highness Princess Alice,

33:13.030 --> 33:16.500
Countess of Athlon_e will be
here in twenty minutes!

33:16.550 --> 33:18.074
When I give the signal,

33:18.120 --> 33:20.031
the viceregal salute
will be played,

33:20.080 --> 33:24.426
at which point the doors
will open and all will rise.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.381
The Earl and Countess will
make their way to the dais,

33:27.440 --> 33:31.820
where I will present a
bouquet to Princess Alice...

33:31.870 --> 33:33.303
Thought it was eight year-olds

33:33.350 --> 33:35.352
who shoved flowers in
a princess's face.

33:35.400 --> 33:39.439
It's Carol's parade,
don't rain on it.

33:39.490 --> 33:43.096
I will then show the Earl and
Countess to their seats.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.664
Where they will take a moment to
relax and enjoy the scenery.

33:45.710 --> 33:48.588
Then and only then will you sit.

33:48.630 --> 33:52.327
And Miss McRae will
speak about the bombs.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.428
Looks like business
is still pretty good.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.607
Look at this place,
your dad's doing really well.

34:10.650 --> 34:12.345
You're kidding, right?

34:12.390 --> 34:14.858
Nobody buys fireworks no more.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.171
Even if they did,

34:16.220 --> 34:20.657
you can't get inventory.
Suppliers are shut off.

34:20.710 --> 34:23.577
Everything goes to the
damn war effort.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.349
Could be worse.

34:25.410 --> 34:27.571
Yeah, how?

34:31.460 --> 34:34.452
Could be your old man
they locked up.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.945
He's coming,
get ready!

34:51.740 --> 34:53.128
[Phone rings]

34:54.610 --> 34:56.089
Clifford Parry.

34:56.130 --> 34:58.178
Everythings in place.
Waiting for target.

34:59.270 --> 35:00.919
You_ remember that
night, Frankie?

35:00.960 --> 35:03.702
When they declared
war on Italy?

35:03.750 --> 35:04.967
Yeah.

35:05.010 --> 35:07.228
We came up our street,

35:07.270 --> 35:10.797
my Ma was on the porch
sobbing her guts out.

35:10.840 --> 35:15.197
Said I had to go to the
detainment centre.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.459
Bring Pa's rosary
and a warm coat.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.491
I remember that.

35:20.550 --> 35:23.587
We told you to do the same.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.507
Expect,

35:26.550 --> 35:30.589
your dad didn't need
an extra coat, did he?

35:30.650 --> 35:32.720
He got out the next morning.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.169
While they loaded my old man
onto a truck.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.825
I'm just wondering why
you're bringing my dad up now.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.997
'Cause I want to hear from
you what happened...

35:40.050 --> 35:43.178
while I can still hear it.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.619
That's him.

35:44.660 --> 35:49.393
No stupid moves Marco,
you'll get us killed.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.579
Mr. Mahoney.

35:54.710 --> 35:57.144
I don't enjoy picking up
hitch-hikers, you got me?

35:57.190 --> 35:58.623
We're in this together, sir.

35:58.670 --> 36:02.674
Yeah. Together.
Now let's move.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.153
He's here!

36:05.200 --> 36:06.633
The Governor General's here!

36:13.730 --> 36:15.163
Take him down.

36:28.090 --> 36:28.658
Police!

36:28.700 --> 36:30.042
Don't move!

36:30.100 --> 36:33.001
Get on your knees!

36:33.060 --> 36:34.220
What is this?

36:34.270 --> 36:36.659
Get on your knees now!

36:58.120 --> 37:01.248
Thanks for asking me
to do the thing.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.029
You made me proud.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.604
Nobody could have done
a better presentation.

37:09.350 --> 37:12.956
Princess Alice, she looked
right at me and she said,

37:13.010 --> 37:15.570
"Mums, how lovely."

37:15.620 --> 37:18.578
Just like a regular person.

37:20.060 --> 37:22.096
Sometimes you look at Carol
and see a little girl

37:22.150 --> 37:24.618
just wanting to be special.

37:24.670 --> 37:25.625
Yup.

37:25.670 --> 37:28.059
There's a bit of
that going around.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.377
It's done.

37:39.430 --> 37:42.115
Mahoney and DiCarlo
are in custody.

37:42.170 --> 37:45.037
And Marco?

37:45.080 --> 37:48.993
I won't turn over his file,
and no charges will be laid.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.396
I hope he realizes
what you did for him.

38:00.660 --> 38:03.140
Looks like the stolen
TNT, Sergeant.

38:05.930 --> 38:07.716
They found the VicMu TNT here.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.320
You were mixed up in the
smuggling all along.

38:10.370 --> 38:12.361
Just playing me.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.751
Why?

38:13.810 --> 38:17.029
This country kicked the crap
out of both our fathers.

38:17.070 --> 38:19.197
Yours went to the camp,

38:19.250 --> 38:21.150
but they broke mine
just the same.

38:21.210 --> 38:24.247
Made him into the kind of
man who'd turn on his own.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.996
I wanted my pride back,
Marco.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.076
But why me, Frankie?

38:34.440 --> 38:36.567
Frankie— It's the war.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.963
Police - Well played, Moretti.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.193
Police - You're free to go.

39:07.860 --> 39:10.863
House is so quiet
once Reggie goes out.

39:12.950 --> 39:16.306
Remember how nice it
used to be with the kids?

39:16.350 --> 39:19.217
Ellie upstairs would
pound on the floor,

39:19.260 --> 39:22.263
calling us worse than a
three-ring circus.

39:24.050 --> 39:25.392
You know,

39:25.450 --> 39:28.669
Patel says there's some
new fancy medical rigmarole.

39:28.710 --> 39:31.224
The upshot of which is,

39:31.280 --> 39:33.794
there's a chance they could
help these legs some.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.922
Let's please not
discuss that man.

39:38.330 --> 39:40.457
Careful, you almost
landed on top of me.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.287
You_ never used to
mind so much.

39:43.330 --> 39:45.195
When we first
started gomg out,

39:45.250 --> 39:48.242
you couldn't keep
your hands off me.

39:48.290 --> 39:51.168
Ha! That's not how
I remember it.

39:51.210 --> 39:56.204
You don't remember how we
scandalized folks just
riding the Yonge streetcar.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.081
Remember our date at
the Winter Garden?

39:59.130 --> 40:04.136
Under all those leaves,
was like a fairy tale.

40:04.180 --> 40:07.399
Then sneaking up the steps
to the spire of St. James.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.226
What a view.

40:09.270 --> 40:10.578
What a kiss.

40:12.270 --> 40:13.578
Was our first.

40:14.970 --> 40:16.369
You think I've forgotten?

40:22.240 --> 40:24.322
You'll make me drop a stitch.

40:24.370 --> 40:26.065
Bob that's going
to unravel.

40:26.110 --> 40:27.111
Let it.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.195
See what happens.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.446
I miss you.

41:09.680 --> 41:10.806
Marion?

41:22.130 --> 41:23.643
Mom?

41:24.780 --> 41:27.692
You're here?
You're alive?

41:30.610 --> 41:34.262
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay, honey.

41:34.310 --> 41:36.699
Father told me you were dead.

41:36.750 --> 41:39.708
Too proud to admit I left him.

41:39.750 --> 41:40.614
But I did.

41:40.670 --> 41:43.059
I grabbed the boys and I ran.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.752
I had no idea he would
go looking for you.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.018
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

41:49.070 --> 41:52.540
How did you find me?

41:52.590 --> 41:54.717
Your young man's letter.

41:54.770 --> 41:57.807
The boys got your cards,
but there was never a
return address.

41:57.860 --> 42:01.682
And I understand why.

42:01.730 --> 42:05.461
Do you know about Dad?

42:05.520 --> 42:08.250
I know he died.

42:08.300 --> 42:11.827
There's so much to say and
I'm gasping for a cup of tea.

42:11.870 --> 42:13.918
I left North Bay at
seven this morning.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.212
There's a cafe just
down the block.

42:16.270 --> 42:17.043
Come on.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.574
[Ladies and Gentlemen]

42:23.620 --> 42:26.498
[Please take your seats as the
concert will soon begin.]

42:39.640 --> 42:40.595
Miss Witham.

42:43.210 --> 42:44.598
What a delightful surprise.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.039
Oh, I doubt that.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.607
Or did you somehow forget
I hold a subscription?

42:50.740 --> 42:52.344
Point to you.

42:52.390 --> 42:53.698
And what's the game?

42:53.740 --> 42:54.866
I'd say cat-and-mouse.

42:54.920 --> 42:58.219
I'd say it's more
of a charade.

42:58.270 --> 42:59.783
I'm sorry if I've been...

42:59.830 --> 43:00.694
distant.

43:00.750 --> 43:01.694
I was working.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.706
And now that the job is done,

43:03.750 --> 43:07.095
you think I'm yours for the
taking with a bottle of
fizzy wine?

43:07.140 --> 43:09.700
You know you have
beautiful neck.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.409
I inherited it
from my mother,

43:11.450 --> 43:13.668
who's about to spot
us any second.

43:14.980 --> 43:17.414
I won't be a_nuisance if
you're not interested.

43:17.460 --> 43:18.802
If you are,

43:18.850 --> 43:22.320
I could manage to be
much less distant.

43:22.380 --> 43:24.848
I'll let you know.

43:24.900 --> 43:27.812
Wait for my signal.
