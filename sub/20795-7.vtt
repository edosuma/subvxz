<i>Previously on</i> I'm Dying Up Here...

00:06.033 --> 00:08.475
- The hell are we doing here?
- Said you wanted an audience.

00:08.555 --> 00:09.896
But I'm not an alcoholic.

00:09.996 --> 00:11.338
Yeah, don't open with that.

00:11.438 --> 00:14.101
Bill, it's over. Go home.

00:14.201 --> 00:15.920
Well, I did the one thing
that no comic's ever done.

00:15.922 --> 00:17.904
I got my shit together.

00:18.004 --> 00:19.566
I could put together a group of women,

00:19.646 --> 00:22.629
make them pee their pants faster
than bad Nielsen ratings.

00:22.729 --> 00:25.312
You could call your special
<i>Girls Are Funny Too.</i>

00:25.412 --> 00:26.893
Edgar, Melvin and I served together.

00:26.973 --> 00:28.175
Oh, really? What restaurant?

00:30.537 --> 00:32.920
- I'm not a fucking junkie.
- No, not you.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.740
Who's the cute blonde
you got going up here?

00:34.781 --> 00:36.283
<i>Does the Texas Jew thing?</i>

00:36.383 --> 00:39.106
Cassie's not ready yet. I got
a laugh track says she is.

00:39.186 --> 00:40.705
We agree to this, the
project moves forward?

00:40.707 --> 00:41.648
Green-lit.

00:41.748 --> 00:42.929
You're in.

00:43.029 --> 00:44.851
You told me that my act wasn't ready.

00:44.951 --> 00:46.893
Who said anything about doing your act?

00:46.993 --> 00:48.995
They want the girl from Wink.

lot of handyman work,</i>

01:17.624 --> 01:19.126
<i>growing up.</i>

01:19.226 --> 01:21.728

01:29.836 --> 01:31.818

you doing in here?</i>

01:31.918 --> 01:34.000
<i>That hooker in the trunk

01:39.486 --> 01:40.885
<i>All right, thank you, folks.</i>

01:40.887 --> 01:42.149
<i>You've been a...</i>

01:42.249 --> 01:43.368
<i>slightly above average crowd.</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:13.300
Right this way.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.302
Hi.

02:19.966 --> 02:21.388
You have a nice day.

02:34.861 --> 02:36.303
<i>My uncle was the town drunk,</i>

02:36.383 --> 02:39.206
which in Wink, Texas is
an elected position.

02:39.306 --> 02:41.288
I like it.

02:41.388 --> 02:44.451
Uh, it's one of those rare positions

02:44.551 --> 02:48.215
where falling down on the job
is actually a requirement.

02:48.315 --> 02:50.114
Eh, I don't know about that.

02:50.116 --> 02:52.379
I moved to Wink when I was ten

02:52.479 --> 02:53.820
after my parents died.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.022
They went to Heaven,
and we went to Wink.

02:56.122 --> 02:58.385
Stop. No dead parents, I told you.

02:58.485 --> 02:59.806
I know, but some of this new stuff

02:59.886 --> 03:01.748
is really starting to play out there.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.632
This is prime time.

03:05.732 --> 03:07.394
Your parents are out at a hootenanny,

03:07.494 --> 03:09.236
making music blowing through a jug.

03:09.336 --> 03:10.917
All right.

03:11.017 --> 03:12.359
Well, what if I just maim 'em?

03:12.459 --> 03:15.402
Building a relationship
with a network audience

03:15.502 --> 03:18.004
is it's... it's like
building any relationship.

03:18.104 --> 03:19.646
You lead with your best behavior

03:19.746 --> 03:21.328
before you shit on their heads.

03:21.428 --> 03:23.670
You stick with the Texas
twang, the wide-eyed innocence

03:23.750 --> 03:26.973
and... dating
relatives with funny names.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.536
Well, I haven't used Lum yet.

03:29.636 --> 03:31.778
You are a comedy gold mine, Daisy Mae.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.662
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

03:35.762 --> 03:37.944
There you go!

03:38.044 --> 03:39.306
Got my 30-day chip today.

03:41.928 --> 03:44.110
Thirty days without alcohol.

03:44.210 --> 03:47.514
Uh, I also got my "130
days without sex" chip.

03:47.614 --> 03:49.316
Yeah.

03:49.416 --> 03:51.798
That was more of a scar than a chip.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.258
I mean, if it hadn't been for a hand job

03:53.260 --> 03:55.121
I got just for shutting up,

03:55.221 --> 03:56.941
we could be talking about
well over a year here.

03:59.185 --> 04:01.065
But, I mean, if you think
I got a drinking problem,

04:01.067 --> 04:03.690
you should see the women that
agree to have sex with me.

04:03.790 --> 04:07.133
They are basically just
vaginas floating in vodka.

04:08.795 --> 04:11.137
Ahh, okay. That's my time.

04:11.237 --> 04:12.899
Uh, this next guy...

04:12.999 --> 04:15.582
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!
Not for the faint of heart.

04:15.682 --> 04:17.242
He's done some pretty unforgivable shit.

04:17.284 --> 04:19.065
Let's give a big Try
God welcome to Terry.

04:19.165 --> 04:20.307
Terry, everybody.

04:26.293 --> 04:27.674
Keep coming back.

04:27.774 --> 04:29.956
Are you kidding? I love this room.

04:30.056 --> 04:31.358
Hi, Terry.

04:31.458 --> 04:35.161
Jesus Christ!

04:35.261 --> 04:37.204
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Lovis.

04:37.304 --> 04:38.943
There's a lot of chatter
about you in here, huh?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.106
The booths are full of suits.

04:40.186 --> 04:41.888
All right. Thanks.

04:41.988 --> 04:44.431
Your next comedian coming to
the stage is a very funny guy.

04:44.511 --> 04:47.294
Formerly a very funny
doorman here at Goldie's.

04:47.394 --> 04:50.217
Big round of applause for Joey Spencer!

04:50.317 --> 04:53.019
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:53.119 --> 04:54.901
All right, thanks.

04:55.001 --> 04:57.744
Manny Martinez, everybody,
keep it going for him.

04:59.606 --> 05:01.006
It's okay, he's the one Mexican here

05:01.047 --> 05:02.549
who's not trying to steal your job...

05:05.932 --> 05:07.534
Joey Spencer, ladies and gentlemen, huh?

05:07.614 --> 05:09.316
Let's keep it going.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.416
I'm Mike Lovis, and I've
been working the door here

05:11.458 --> 05:12.819
at Goldie's a lot longer than him.

05:12.899 --> 05:14.138
Ain't that right, shit-stain?

05:14.140 --> 05:15.602
Sounds like a yes to me.

05:15.702 --> 05:17.462
So I'm in the grocery store
the other day and I see a

05:17.464 --> 05:19.103
- woman start to have a seizure.
- Just get off the...

05:19.105 --> 05:20.825
God damn it! In the "12
items or less" line.

05:20.907 --> 05:22.987
So I do what any person would
do in that kind of situation.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.771
I start counting how many items she has

05:24.871 --> 05:27.133
in... her... fucking cart.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.696
No, no, no.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.778
So I'm all like, "Twelve, 13..."

05:31.878 --> 05:34.100
She had 17 fucking items in her cart!

05:34.200 --> 05:35.562
Three years! Three years I worked

05:35.642 --> 05:37.042
- that fucking door!
- Go over here!

05:37.123 --> 05:39.225
And I've been up in The Cellar one time!

05:39.325 --> 05:41.227
And Joey gets the fucking Main Stage!

05:41.327 --> 05:42.927
Fucking bullshit!

05:42.929 --> 05:44.328
- All right, Joey Spencer.
- ...fucker!

05:44.330 --> 05:45.952
Keep it going for Joey Spencer.

05:48.655 --> 05:49.956
Sorry, everybody.

05:50.056 --> 05:51.798
Um...

05:51.898 --> 05:53.618
So I was out with this
girl the other night.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.721
Ah!

05:54.821 --> 05:56.363
What the hell's going on in here?

05:56.463 --> 05:57.924
Lovis flipped out.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.806
Must be some kind of doorman syndrome.

05:59.906 --> 06:01.648
How 'bout those gas prices, huh?

06:01.748 --> 06:03.049
What's the deal with that, huh?

06:03.149 --> 06:04.531
No... no, no!

06:04.631 --> 06:06.893
Ron. Take the door.

06:06.993 --> 06:08.495
Nixon was...

06:08.595 --> 06:10.256
- Me?
- That's your name, right?

06:10.356 --> 06:12.316
Yeah, yeah, no, I-I just
didn't know that you knew it.

06:12.318 --> 06:13.478
It was great catching up with you.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.941
Now grab the fucking door.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.280
Three years, three years
I worked that fucking door!

06:16.282 --> 06:17.584
Yes, ma'am.

06:17.684 --> 06:20.947
Goldie told me... Did you...

06:21.047 --> 06:22.989
- Lovis, it's cool!
- You did good.

06:23.089 --> 06:25.712
Fucking bullshit! Fuck you!

06:25.812 --> 06:27.874
Now get your fucking ass out!

06:32.378 --> 06:34.080
Arnie.

06:34.180 --> 06:35.922
Goldie told me to watch the door.

06:36.022 --> 06:37.203
She knows my name.

06:37.303 --> 06:38.525
Ooh, stirring.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.306
You watching the door,
you need a T-shirt.

06:40.386 --> 06:41.328
What size are you?

06:41.428 --> 06:42.208
Medium.

06:42.308 --> 06:43.650
Oh, we only have smalls.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.011
Why the fuck did you ask?

06:45.111 --> 06:46.551
It's called common courtesy, douchebag.

06:46.553 --> 06:47.293
All right.

06:47.393 --> 06:49.295
Give Ron a large shirt.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.944
That is the weirdest sex
ever, the weirdest sex, okay?

06:58.044 --> 07:00.787
Now, ladies, I don't want y'all
to take this the wrong way,

07:00.887 --> 07:02.869
but y'all are fucking crazy.

07:04.210 --> 07:06.152
Always trying to figure us men out.

07:06.252 --> 07:08.314
You think I'm playing?

07:08.414 --> 07:10.837
When JFK got shot, his wife
jumped on the trunk of the car

07:10.937 --> 07:12.719
and grabbed his brains.

07:12.819 --> 07:15.682
Even when we dead, y'all
wanna know what we thinking.

07:18.064 --> 07:21.608
Bay of Pigs? No.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.530
Cuban missile crisis?

07:23.630 --> 07:25.632
Not interested.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.334
Marilyn.

07:29.395 --> 07:30.617
That bitch.

07:30.717 --> 07:34.100
I knew you was in here somewhere.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.703
You're in some shit when
we get to the house.

07:43.449 --> 07:45.351
I'm from Boston originally.

07:45.451 --> 07:48.234
Uh, my father owned a men's shop.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.797
Big sports town, Boston.
Big sports town.

07:50.897 --> 07:53.560
Red Sox, Yankees. You know?

07:53.660 --> 07:57.043
One of the great rivalries
in professional sports.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.886
Uh, my father, he hated the Yankees.

07:59.986 --> 08:01.408
You know?

08:01.508 --> 08:04.571
The-the thing my father
detests most, in order,

08:04.671 --> 08:07.934
are the Yankees, the Nazis,

08:08.034 --> 08:09.536
and ill-fitting suits.

08:11.918 --> 08:13.940
Um, my father's very critical

08:14.040 --> 08:15.782
of-of how people dressed.

08:15.882 --> 08:18.224
In fact, when we go to see
the Sox play the Yankees

08:18.324 --> 08:20.947
at Fenway Park, my father would
often direct his insults

08:21.047 --> 08:23.007
at how the Yankees players
looked in their uniforms

08:23.009 --> 08:25.512
rather than the players themselves.

08:25.612 --> 08:27.233
Hey, Mantle!

08:28.414 --> 08:29.636
Mantle!

08:29.736 --> 08:31.958
You look like shit out there!

08:32.058 --> 08:34.640
A well-fitted shoulder should lie flat

08:34.741 --> 08:36.402
and be the same length
as the bone und...

08:36.501 --> 08:40.447
You okay, sir? You-you
need to walk or...

08:40.547 --> 08:42.288
Thank you.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.451
A well-fitted shoulder should lie flat

08:44.551 --> 08:46.973
and be the same length
as the bone under it!

08:47.073 --> 08:48.673
And should meet the
sleeve of the uniform

08:48.715 --> 08:51.097
right where your arm
meets your shoulder!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.199
Ya bum!

08:54.520 --> 08:56.522
Pick up.

09:01.527 --> 09:02.989
Okay. Thank you.

09:03.089 --> 09:05.872
You've been a very
well-behaved audience.

09:13.940 --> 09:17.163
You good over here? All right.

09:17.263 --> 09:19.806
Hey, would you guys like
some refills, or...

09:19.906 --> 09:22.008
All right.

09:22.108 --> 09:24.050
- Would you like a refill?
- Decaf.

09:24.150 --> 09:25.211
Okay.

09:25.311 --> 09:26.452
Funny stuff.

09:26.552 --> 09:28.414
Uh, yeah, doing my best.

09:28.514 --> 09:29.736
Kenny Vesey.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.217
Uh, hey.

09:31.317 --> 09:34.380
Eddie Zeidel.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.742
Wait, are you, uh,

09:35.842 --> 09:38.024
are you <i>Kenny In The AM?</i>

09:38.124 --> 09:39.385
Kenny!

09:39.485 --> 09:41.427
Holy shit. Man.

09:41.527 --> 09:43.750
I-I listen to you all the
time since I've, uh,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.391
since I've been here from Boston.

09:45.491 --> 09:47.393
I'm a Yankee fan. But

09:47.493 --> 09:48.933
I'm gonna fight every instinct I have

09:48.935 --> 09:50.436
and still leave you a decent tip.

09:50.536 --> 09:52.599
Well, my hand-to-mouth
existence thanks you.

09:53.780 --> 09:55.682
No, seriously, man, uh...

09:55.782 --> 09:57.283
- You and Klein the other day.
- Mm.

09:57.383 --> 09:58.805
It was so funny.

09:58.905 --> 10:01.047
Jesus, I've known Bobby
since our New York days.

10:01.147 --> 10:02.368
Yeah, we did, uh,

10:02.468 --> 10:03.748
did a lot of coffee shops together.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.772
- Right.
- Seriously though.

10:05.872 --> 10:06.653
Funny shit.

10:06.753 --> 10:08.014
Especially the closer.

10:08.114 --> 10:09.616
"Closer," huh?

10:09.716 --> 10:11.858
More like segue to pouring coffee.

10:11.958 --> 10:13.099
Well,

10:13.199 --> 10:14.541
keep at it.

10:14.641 --> 10:16.082
Maybe one day soon we'll have you on.

10:16.162 --> 10:18.424
- Oh.
- You know what? Here.

10:18.524 --> 10:20.026
Thanks for Babe Ruth.

10:20.126 --> 10:21.527
And thank you for <i>No No Nanette.</i>

10:26.492 --> 10:28.915
I can't tell you how anxious CMA is

10:29.015 --> 10:31.197
to get into the Nick
Beverly business, huh?

10:31.297 --> 10:32.679
Seriously.

10:32.779 --> 10:34.761
Yeah, I'm more of a, uh,
mom and pop operation

10:34.861 --> 10:36.242
right now than a business.

10:36.342 --> 10:38.284
We launch careers, Nick.

10:38.384 --> 10:41.247
- Yeah.
- Seriously, that's what we do.

10:41.347 --> 10:43.730
Look, as a side note, uh,

10:45.591 --> 10:49.255
I'm a full-service agent, Nick. Hm?

10:49.355 --> 10:53.299
You say jump. I say how

10:53.399 --> 10:56.342
Bolivian. Not so much as a footprint.

10:56.442 --> 10:57.704
Yeah, not much of a coke man,

10:57.804 --> 10:59.425
but a lovely gesture nonetheless.

10:59.525 --> 11:00.707
Cool.

11:00.807 --> 11:02.909
Just know,

11:03.009 --> 11:04.470
late or loaded,

11:04.570 --> 11:07.313
CMA has got your back, Nick.

11:07.413 --> 11:08.474
Seriously.

11:08.574 --> 11:10.516
Late and loaded, I got.

11:10.616 --> 11:13.079
So why don't we go with
rich and famous, huh?

11:13.179 --> 11:15.962
Speaking my language.

11:16.062 --> 11:19.405
Your wish is my command.

11:19.505 --> 11:21.487
<i>Hey, I'm gonna
hit the road early.</i>

11:21.587 --> 11:22.929
7 a.m. sharp.

11:23.029 --> 11:24.010
You hear me?

11:24.110 --> 11:25.531
Yeah. 7 a.m. sharp.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.974
So that means, what,
you'll be ready by 8?

11:28.074 --> 11:30.296
8:15. I still haven't packed.

11:30.396 --> 11:32.739
Oh, yeah. It's your Sonny and Cher gig.

11:32.839 --> 11:34.941
Yeah, baby, four
sold-out shows in Vegas.

11:35.041 --> 11:36.422
Oh.

11:36.522 --> 11:38.204
It's like a boring white
people convention.

11:38.284 --> 11:40.084
Yeah, but I'm gonna be yawning
all the way to the bank

11:40.086 --> 11:41.868
at a grand a gig to open for those two.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.310
Bring me to Vegas. I'd
be nice to get away.

11:44.410 --> 11:47.473
Well, Edgar already wormed
his way into driving.

11:47.573 --> 11:51.237
I didn't worm my way into driving, okay?

11:51.337 --> 11:53.319
That's like saying
somebody wormed their way

11:53.419 --> 11:54.921
into painting your apartment.

11:55.021 --> 11:56.282
Comped room at Caesar's?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.324
All the food and drink you can handle?

11:58.424 --> 12:00.366
You a motherfucking
worm, and you know it.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.369
It's a little wormy.

12:03.469 --> 12:04.989
First of all, if you go anyway,

12:05.071 --> 12:06.532
which bed you gonna sleep in?

12:06.632 --> 12:08.574
Mine or Edgar's?

12:08.674 --> 12:10.136
Oh, hey.

12:10.236 --> 12:11.675
Here's a funny prick you want to know.

12:11.677 --> 12:14.500
Bill Hobbs, Miles Farber, CMA.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.903
Bill Hobbs, yeah. Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.825
I seen your stuff. I'm a big fan.

12:18.925 --> 12:20.266
Seriously.

12:20.366 --> 12:21.587
Yeah, we've already met.

12:21.687 --> 12:23.309
When you passed on repping me.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.630
Uh, yeah, sorry,

12:24.730 --> 12:26.432
I usually don't forget a face.

12:26.532 --> 12:28.434
No, please, forget this one.

12:28.534 --> 12:30.656
That way, a year from now
after I've been on <i>Carson</i>

12:30.736 --> 12:32.558
and you come crawling
back to suck my cock,

12:32.658 --> 12:34.360
I can tell you to go fuck yourself.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.462
Seriously.

12:37.743 --> 12:39.745
I did say prick.

12:46.552 --> 12:47.854
You know, Goldie,

12:47.954 --> 12:49.816
I've always liked your club.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.998
Something about it reminds
me of my daddy's place.

12:53.759 --> 12:55.862
Yeah, all the talent
that's come through here.

12:55.962 --> 12:57.824
Only instead of, uh, Coleman Hawkins

12:57.924 --> 12:59.625
and Thelonious Monk,

12:59.725 --> 13:02.468
now it's Richard and Carlin.

13:02.568 --> 13:05.031
Different music, but same energy.

13:05.131 --> 13:08.554
That's lovely, Barton. You
got something on your mind?

13:08.654 --> 13:10.476
- Adam Proteau.
- What about him?

13:10.576 --> 13:12.358
I'm just wondering, is it wise

13:12.458 --> 13:15.201
you hiding him in your cellar is all?

13:17.583 --> 13:19.645
Carl is a good manager.

13:19.745 --> 13:21.687
And he was taking care of that kid.

13:21.787 --> 13:23.970
Till you whispered in his ear.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.452
Nobody's casting aspersions.

13:26.552 --> 13:28.334
Boy made his own decisions.

13:28.434 --> 13:29.495
Yeah?

13:29.595 --> 13:31.217
So what are you to him now?

13:31.317 --> 13:32.378
A friend.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.700
No financial entanglements.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.582
Just seems obvious, so much talent.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.545
And look, when you got a van Gogh,

13:39.645 --> 13:41.307
you don't hang it in the cellar.

13:44.971 --> 13:46.192
It's my van Gogh.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.075
I'll hang it wherever the fuck I want.

13:49.175 --> 13:52.238
Look, Barton, I'm sure
you're a hell of a pimp,

13:52.338 --> 13:54.080
but don't ever come into my club

13:54.180 --> 13:56.923
and tell me how to handle my kids.

13:57.023 --> 13:58.284
Stick to what you know...

13:58.384 --> 14:00.887
Racketeering and getting Pryor laid.

14:09.996 --> 14:12.658
Don't fool yourself, Goldie.

14:12.758 --> 14:16.382
We're both pimps.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.865
Only my whores get paid.

14:21.647 --> 14:23.709
So I've been making
the amend rounds lately.

14:23.809 --> 14:26.953
Uh, it's been about eight weeks,
and I'm up to the Cs now.

14:27.053 --> 14:29.876
- Hold for laughs.
- Really?

14:29.976 --> 14:31.497
You know what? A-at least my audience

14:31.577 --> 14:33.377
can get up and leave; yours
are trapped till they

14:33.379 --> 14:36.122
finish their unpronounceable
sausage specials.

14:36.222 --> 14:38.604
Don't you feel bad pretending
to be an alcoholic

14:38.704 --> 14:40.166
just to work on your material?

14:40.266 --> 14:42.128
Are you kidding?

14:42.228 --> 14:44.068
It's like one country song
after another in there.

14:44.070 --> 14:47.413
Trust me, I'm providing
much-needed comic relief.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.473
Besides I gotta up my game
now that I'm a door guy.

14:49.475 --> 14:51.075
I mean, Goldie gives those
guys special treatment.

14:51.077 --> 14:52.917
They get to pick their own
spots at open-mic night,

14:52.919 --> 14:54.580
so she's bound to see me.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.543
And when she does...
<i>Carson,</i> here I come.

14:57.643 --> 15:00.106
Hold for the amazing
lack of self-awareness.

15:00.206 --> 15:01.445
A year from now when me and Johnny

15:01.447 --> 15:02.829
are playing golf together,

15:02.929 --> 15:04.490
I want you to think back on this moment

15:04.570 --> 15:06.993
when you wonder why I
never ask you to caddie.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.134
<i>All right,
thanks for that call, Sharon.</i>

15:10.136 --> 15:11.838
<i>Now, you heard her, folks.</i>

15:11.938 --> 15:13.257
<i>If you like funnel cakes,
if you like petting zoos,</i>

15:13.259 --> 15:15.001
<i>you are running out of time!</i>

15:15.101 --> 15:17.263
<i>This is the final weekend,
so head on over to that</i>

15:17.343 --> 15:19.045
<i>L.A. County Fair!</i>

15:19.145 --> 15:21.647
<i>Stay tuned, everybody
this is</i> Kenny in the AM.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.672
All right, Kenny
Vesey, everybody,

16:08.674 --> 16:09.713
and we're talking to Nick Beverly

16:09.715 --> 16:12.378
on <i>Kenny in the AM!</i>

16:14.200 --> 16:16.542
<i>Man, biscuit!</i>

16:16.642 --> 16:18.002
Now, I don't know how
many of you caught it,

16:18.004 --> 16:19.445
but Nick was on <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

16:19.525 --> 16:21.747
What was that, about a week ago?
How'd that go?

16:21.847 --> 16:22.788
It was incredible.

16:22.888 --> 16:24.670
How bad was Ed's breath?

16:24.770 --> 16:27.173
Because when I was on, he could
have knocked a buzzard off a

16:27.253 --> 16:28.754
wagon!

16:28.854 --> 16:30.276
It was so bad...

16:30.376 --> 16:31.615
Yeah, I can't say I got that close,

16:31.617 --> 16:33.879
but Johnny smelled delightful.

16:33.979 --> 16:36.882
I'd like to find a car freshener
that smells just like Johnny.

16:36.982 --> 16:38.424
All right. Speaking of cars,

16:38.504 --> 16:40.486
it's time for KROQ's traffic and weather

16:40.586 --> 16:44.850
on <i>Kenny in the AM!</i>

16:49.675 --> 16:51.257
I'm just not totally sold.

16:51.357 --> 16:52.698
Are you a fuckin' idiot?

16:52.798 --> 16:55.301
Doorman's a plumb gig.

16:55.401 --> 16:57.303
How much money you make
is totally up to you.

16:57.403 --> 17:00.106
It's all a big hustle, Ronnie.

17:00.206 --> 17:02.548
Hey, what's this "Ronnie" shit?

17:02.648 --> 17:05.871
All right, here's the deal, "Ronnie."

17:05.971 --> 17:08.434
Main room has three levels, 'kay?

17:08.534 --> 17:10.316
Up front, that's your target range

17:10.415 --> 17:11.537
for comics doing crowd work.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.598
Ideally you want to sit hot chicks,

17:13.699 --> 17:16.082
old guys with hot chicks,
and homosexuals.

17:16.182 --> 17:17.661
And how will I know they're homosexuals?

17:17.663 --> 17:19.685
You know, homo behavior.

17:19.785 --> 17:21.446
Giggling, white wine.

17:21.547 --> 17:23.089
Manners.

17:23.189 --> 17:25.171
The back is noisy and it
has poor sight lines,

17:25.271 --> 17:26.632
so that's strictly for the rabble.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.374
So the prime seating is the booths?

17:28.473 --> 17:29.633
Oh, yeah, that's where you're

17:29.635 --> 17:31.137
gonna make most of your bread.

17:31.237 --> 17:33.419
Say some high roller comes
in asking about a booth,

17:33.519 --> 17:35.701
you say, "Sorry, pal.

17:35.801 --> 17:37.923
These booths are reserved
for Presidents Lincoln,

17:38.003 --> 17:39.345
Hamilton, and Jackson."

17:39.445 --> 17:41.067
Hamilton was not a president.

17:41.167 --> 17:43.249
He was the country's first
Secretary of the Treasury,

17:43.329 --> 17:46.432
and he also helped found
the Federalist Party.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.714
Well, cock-a-doodle- who-gives-a-fuck?

17:48.814 --> 17:51.197
Anyway,

17:51.297 --> 17:53.599
I'm doorman supervisor, so I
get 20 percent of your take.

17:53.699 --> 17:54.720
Are you shitting me?

17:54.820 --> 17:56.162
Eh, you'll still make plenty.

17:56.262 --> 18:00.406
That's where I started. Look at me now.

18:00.506 --> 18:02.928
Not right now, later now.

18:03.028 --> 18:04.610
When I'm dressed.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.654
Hey, fuck you! I own a Mustang!

18:08.754 --> 18:10.354
<i>All right,
we're back everybody.</i>

18:10.356 --> 18:11.355
<i>Kenny Vesey, we're
talking to Nick Beverly</i>

18:11.357 --> 18:12.618
<i>about Dodger fans...</i>

18:12.718 --> 18:14.500
Ooh, Nick's on.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.482
<i>Only
tension during the game</i>

18:16.562 --> 18:18.362
<i>is when it's all tied up in
the middle of the seventh</i>

18:18.364 --> 18:20.003
<i>and they can't find their
cars in the parking lot.</i>

18:21.647 --> 18:23.767
You know Kenny Vesey caught my
act at the deli last night?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.831
Complimented me. Nice guy.

18:25.931 --> 18:27.353
I got to tell you something, pal.

18:27.453 --> 18:29.012
I used to go to a lot
of Yankees-Sox games.

18:29.014 --> 18:30.836
And my uncle, who was a tailor,

18:30.936 --> 18:32.878
all his insults about the Sox

18:32.978 --> 18:34.378
used to be about how their clothes fit.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.761
Hey, Ted Williams!

18:35.861 --> 18:37.763
<i>A well-fitted shoulder lies flat</i>

18:37.863 --> 18:39.463
<i>and should meet the
sleeve of your uniform</i>

18:39.465 --> 18:41.487
<i>right where your arm
meets your shoulder!</i>

18:41.587 --> 18:42.488
<i>Ya bum!</i>

18:44.390 --> 18:45.411
That's your joke.

18:45.511 --> 18:47.333
I wouldn't be bragging.

18:47.433 --> 18:49.032
<i>I'm gonna
tell you how the term...</i>

18:49.034 --> 18:51.036
That motherfucker.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.222
- What? What the hell?
- Jesus.

18:56.322 --> 18:57.583
What... what is all this?

18:57.683 --> 18:59.505
Extra, extra. Read all about it.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.187
Goldie Herschlag,

19:01.287 --> 19:05.030
exec producing CBS comedy special.

19:06.692 --> 19:09.034
Finally, news that's fit to print.

19:09.134 --> 19:11.197
- Madam?
- Apple wine?

19:11.297 --> 19:12.838
Where's the Dom?

19:12.938 --> 19:13.879
Uh-uh-uh.

19:13.979 --> 19:15.321
There's a story.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.603
Well, I hope it's a
story about champagne.

19:17.703 --> 19:20.926
Years ago, before I had a dime,

19:21.026 --> 19:23.529
I toasted my very first
deal with a bottle

19:23.629 --> 19:28.534
of this fine Boone's Farm Apple Wine.

19:28.634 --> 19:32.258
And nothing... And I mean nothin'...

19:32.358 --> 19:33.339
Ever tasted as good.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.940
Come here.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.349
Mmm.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.470
That is yummy.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.037
This is big.

19:52.137 --> 19:54.400
Are you kid...

19:54.500 --> 19:57.963
As your lawyer, I'm telling
you, this is <i>very</i> big.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.366
And don't worry about the Dom,
there'll be plenty of that

20:00.466 --> 20:02.368
tomorrow night at the Dansaks' party.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.510
Good, because this is awful.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.296
You know, uh, Camille's
gonna be there, so...

20:10.396 --> 20:12.398
Course she is. She's your wife.

20:16.242 --> 20:17.303
To our baby.

20:17.403 --> 20:19.585
Ohh...

20:19.685 --> 20:21.687
Mmm.

20:28.254 --> 20:29.515
Hey.

20:29.615 --> 20:31.277
I thought you was moving furniture.

20:31.377 --> 20:32.598
Yeah.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.420
For my people, beanbag
chairs are furniture.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.616
Hey.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.578
Getting in the zone.

20:52.678 --> 20:54.380
What kind of black dude are you?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.542
Look, Sonny and Cher
have done me a solid.

20:56.642 --> 20:59.144
I'm opening for the biggest
audience I've ever played for

20:59.244 --> 21:00.666
all because they believe in me.

21:00.766 --> 21:04.470
So forgive me if I don't share your ire.

21:04.570 --> 21:06.031
"Ire"?

21:06.131 --> 21:09.114
I repeat, what kind of
black dude are you?

21:09.214 --> 21:11.637
The kind that's trying to
build a motherfucking career

21:11.737 --> 21:13.078
and take care of his own

21:13.178 --> 21:15.220
rather than trying to fix
a motherfucking world

21:15.301 --> 21:16.642
that don't give a shit.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.163
Why does everybody think

21:18.263 --> 21:20.165
every black comic gotta
be all in your face

21:20.265 --> 21:21.407
about how black they are?

21:21.507 --> 21:22.968
Can't shit just be funny?

21:23.068 --> 21:24.690
You see, now that sounded black.

21:24.790 --> 21:26.492
Two octaves higher,
I'd pull over the van

21:26.592 --> 21:27.992
so you could hold up a liquor store.

21:29.194 --> 21:30.616
You'd like that.

21:30.716 --> 21:32.578
The revolution will be televised,

21:32.678 --> 21:34.300
and I'm hosting that motherfucker.

21:43.449 --> 21:45.451
Yeah?

21:48.334 --> 21:50.356
I got a scoop you won't
find in the trades.

21:50.456 --> 21:51.717
Oh, for fuck's sake, Arnie,

21:51.817 --> 21:55.801
does everything with you
come with a drum roll?

21:55.901 --> 21:58.244
I-I just talked to our liquor guy.

21:58.344 --> 22:03.088
He's gonna have one less
stop to make on his route.

22:03.188 --> 22:03.969
Teddy's.

22:04.069 --> 22:05.611
Cut off.

22:05.711 --> 22:08.494
Three months late on his
fucking liquor bill.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.257
Ooh, I like the way
this day is shaping up.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.663
Now this is what I call music.

22:21.727 --> 22:22.868
Oh, shit.

22:25.771 --> 22:27.273
Just... eh-be cool.

22:27.373 --> 22:28.874
I'm cool.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.374
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of everything.

22:30.376 --> 22:31.877
Okay, you do that.

22:33.298 --> 22:34.640
You acting jittery as shit.

22:34.740 --> 22:36.121
Just shut up.

22:39.465 --> 22:40.846
Be cool.

22:40.946 --> 22:43.569
Okay. I got this.

22:43.669 --> 22:45.671
Y-you sure?

22:48.914 --> 22:50.015
Hello, Officer.

22:50.115 --> 22:52.257
License and registration.

22:52.357 --> 22:53.299
Um...

22:53.399 --> 22:55.381
Well, I left it in the van.

22:55.481 --> 22:57.483
I'll just get it.

23:05.370 --> 23:07.573
What the fuck?

23:17.182 --> 23:18.804
What the fuck was that?

23:18.904 --> 23:21.046
I panicked.

23:21.146 --> 23:23.128
Now I'm gonna get screwed over

23:23.228 --> 23:26.011
because you panicked over a
couple of fucking joints?

23:30.716 --> 23:32.658
- Dispatch, this is 166.
<i>- Copy, 166.</i>

23:32.758 --> 23:35.140
We've intercepted a vehicle
with two beanbag chairs

23:35.240 --> 23:38.063
stuffed with over 5,000
hits of THC, copy?

23:38.163 --> 23:40.466
<i>Copy, 166.</i>

23:40.566 --> 23:42.027
Now is the time

23:42.127 --> 23:45.631
you should start
motherfucking panicking.

23:50.576 --> 23:52.157
Oh, when do I get to meet Silverman?

23:52.257 --> 23:53.817
Oh, you know Fred really
wanted to be here,

23:53.819 --> 23:55.160
but he had to give a speech

23:55.260 --> 23:57.843
at some, uh, some animal rights event.

23:57.943 --> 23:59.485
He couldn't switch it around, so...

23:59.585 --> 24:00.926
And have you met my wife, Lisa?

24:01.026 --> 24:02.105
Lisa, honey, come here, come here.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.649
This is Goldie.

24:03.749 --> 24:05.188
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

24:05.190 --> 24:06.790
- Beautiful home you have.
- Oh, thank you.

24:06.792 --> 24:10.736
Everybody, if I could have
your attention please?

24:10.836 --> 24:14.019
One of our honored guests
tonight, Eli Gershman,

24:14.119 --> 24:15.821
his beautiful wife, Camille,

24:15.921 --> 24:17.563
would like to say a
few words, so please.

24:17.643 --> 24:18.744
Camille?

24:21.206 --> 24:22.788
Thank you.

24:22.888 --> 24:25.370
- Please.
- Thank you, Marty.

24:26.972 --> 24:31.036
In 1961, our oldest,
Christopher, was born.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.738
We wanted to welcome him into the world

24:32.818 --> 24:34.800
toasting him with champagne.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.483
The only problem was we were flat broke

24:37.583 --> 24:39.765
after setting up Eli's practice.

24:39.865 --> 24:42.047
Fortunately for us, that was the year

24:42.147 --> 24:44.930
this delightful little vintage came out.

24:45.030 --> 24:47.853
Boone's Farm Apple Wine.

24:49.434 --> 24:51.897
So now, when good things
happen, we remember back

24:51.997 --> 24:54.900
to when love and a buck a
bottle were more than enough.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.301
Aww.

24:56.401 --> 24:58.664
To my darling husband, Eli,

24:58.764 --> 25:01.146
our three wonderful children,

25:01.246 --> 25:04.389
and Eli's formidable partner, Goldie.

25:04.489 --> 25:06.191
Oh..

25:06.291 --> 25:07.793
Congratulations.

25:07.893 --> 25:09.274
Congratulations.

25:10.415 --> 25:11.757
Delightful, just delightful.

25:11.857 --> 25:12.758
Everybody, let's eat.

25:29.955 --> 25:33.579
Oh, come quick. I'm drinking the stars.

25:33.679 --> 25:36.421
Look, the story with the wine was true.

25:36.521 --> 25:38.281
All right, and I wanted
to share it with you.

25:38.283 --> 25:42.828
Just... you know...
Without the back story.

25:42.928 --> 25:44.389
I'm not an idiot, Eli.

25:44.489 --> 25:47.272
I know what we have is a lie.

25:47.372 --> 25:49.955
But what makes it tenable:

25:50.055 --> 25:52.437
we don't lie to each other.

25:52.537 --> 25:55.340
Otherwise, I don't know
what the fuck we're doing.

25:59.344 --> 26:01.126
[Ticket's "Bad Things in the World

26:06.551 --> 26:07.991
How do you know

26:07.993 --> 26:09.895
- who drank out of that?
- I don't.

26:09.995 --> 26:13.278
Ah, sweet mystery of life.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.102
The comedy world just got smaller.

26:17.202 --> 26:18.303
You retiring?

26:18.403 --> 26:20.065
- No, he said "comedy."
- Oh, right.

26:20.165 --> 26:21.965
Hey, Gabe, it's past sundown.
Shouldn't you be

26:22.007 --> 26:24.129
in a synagogue, atoning for
being such a fucking dick?

26:24.209 --> 26:25.711
Ooh, that's a good one.

26:25.811 --> 26:26.792
So what happened?

26:26.892 --> 26:28.754
King Theodore's done.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.395
Cut off by his liquor supplier.

26:30.495 --> 26:32.037
Mm, no shit.

26:32.137 --> 26:33.438
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:33.538 --> 26:35.020
Did you hear about King Theodore's?

26:35.100 --> 26:37.282
Yep, the King is dead;
long live the Queen.

26:37.382 --> 26:38.764
Hey, Cass.

26:38.864 --> 26:41.767
I read about "Vagina
Nights" in the trades.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.089
I can't tell you how happy I am for you.

26:44.189 --> 26:47.132
Wow, guys, overwhelmed with
the support, thank you.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.814
Cassie, you were in the trades?

26:48.914 --> 26:50.513
Yeah and <i>Girls Are Funny
Too</i> is announced.

26:50.515 --> 26:52.417
It's, uh, it's actually happening.

26:52.517 --> 26:54.700
Christ, why can't they
do a guy's version?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.802
They do; it's called the
fucking <i>Tonight Show.</i>

26:56.882 --> 26:58.744
Amen to that.

26:58.844 --> 27:00.145
Amen to what?

27:00.245 --> 27:01.525
<i>Girls Are Funny Too</i> is basically

27:01.566 --> 27:03.388
the Negro League with tits.

27:03.488 --> 27:06.031
Funny is funny... that should
be the sole determining factor.

27:06.131 --> 27:08.171
But, hey, if you want to be
a second-class comedian,

27:08.173 --> 27:09.474
then be my guest.

27:09.574 --> 27:11.076
- He's got a point.
- Oh, yeah?

27:11.176 --> 27:13.759
So if there was a "Jews
Are Funny Too" special,

27:13.859 --> 27:15.761
- you wouldn't sign up?
- Yeah, right.

27:15.861 --> 27:18.163
What, if there were a "Black
Guys Are Funny Too" special

27:18.263 --> 27:21.567
or a "Guys With Glasses Are
Funny Too" special or a

27:21.667 --> 27:24.169
"Guys Who Smell Faintly Like
Urine Are Funny Too" special,

27:24.269 --> 27:25.691
you wouldn't jump at it?

27:25.791 --> 27:27.492
It's a good thing he said "faintly."

27:27.592 --> 27:28.872
Man, biscuit!

27:28.874 --> 27:30.856
Thursday morning. Are we a go?

27:30.956 --> 27:32.578
Yeah, I'll be there, man.

27:32.678 --> 27:33.997
All right, good, you could
do the call-ins with me.

27:33.999 --> 27:36.021
Hey. You stole my joke, asshole.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.823
I'm sorry, who are you?

27:37.923 --> 27:40.145
Oh, I'm the fucking
waiter who told that joke

27:40.245 --> 27:42.467
at the deli yesterday, the one you stole

27:42.567 --> 27:44.670
and said on your radio
show this morning.

27:44.770 --> 27:46.471
- Remember that?
- Hey, pal...

27:46.571 --> 27:48.451
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

27:48.493 --> 27:50.195
You know what you did.

27:50.295 --> 27:51.837
Kenny Vesey.

27:51.937 --> 27:53.599
He's the youngest comic to do <i>Carson.</i>

27:53.699 --> 27:55.240
<i>Carson.</i>

27:55.340 --> 27:57.482
Why the fuck would he
steal your open mic joke?

27:57.582 --> 27:59.204
I'm not sure, why don't you ask him?

27:59.304 --> 28:01.006
Come on, man.

28:01.106 --> 28:02.866
He didn't take it. Plus,
we've seen your act.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.068
I mean, who'd want to pick
corn out of that pile of shit?

28:05.070 --> 28:06.932
Look alive, guys. Eddie,
you're up after Ron.

28:07.032 --> 28:08.333
Let's go

28:08.433 --> 28:10.375
Yeah, not with this jerk-off here.

28:10.475 --> 28:12.858
Fucking nerve
on this little kid.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.920
Ignore him, man, he's an
arrogant little asshole.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.224
What do you call
a Mexican hitchhiking?

28:19.324 --> 28:20.866
Stranded.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.829
This next guy needs no introduction.

28:33.178 --> 28:35.180
Fitzy, ladies and gentlemen.

28:36.701 --> 28:38.563
Uh, if anybody wants an autograph,

28:38.663 --> 28:40.966
he'll be outside vomiting
up cocktail onions

28:41.066 --> 28:43.408
after the show.

28:43.508 --> 28:45.811
So my mother's a big woman.

28:45.911 --> 28:48.253
Yeah, just-just not a fan of exercise.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.095
Little bit of a drinking problem too.

28:50.195 --> 28:52.017
I-I, actually, I tried
to get her to go to AA,

28:52.117 --> 28:55.781
but she refused when she
heard it had 12 steps.

28:57.843 --> 29:00.585
She-she is really, really heavy.

29:00.685 --> 29:01.907
She told me when she dies,

29:02.007 --> 29:03.468
she wants to be cremated

29:03.568 --> 29:05.831
so her ashes can be used
to blot out the sun.

29:10.976 --> 29:12.477
No, I mean, I love my mother,

29:12.577 --> 29:14.739
but, you know, she's...

29:18.663 --> 29:20.926
She, uh...

29:21.026 --> 29:23.488
she-she is, uh, she-she's
just a big lady.

29:23.588 --> 29:26.772
You know, she-she just-she-
you know, she won't exercise.

29:26.872 --> 29:29.614
But I already said that.

29:29.714 --> 29:31.937
Sorry, um...

29:32.037 --> 29:34.339
What, uh, what-what else-what...

29:34.439 --> 29:36.902
Um... oh, yeah, so, uh,

29:37.002 --> 29:39.624
so my name-my name is,
uh, my name's Ron Shack,

29:39.724 --> 29:43.108
which, you know, Fitzy
kind of failed to mention.

29:43.208 --> 29:44.149
Uh, hi.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.812
Uh, Ron is, uh, my nickname.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.636
It's-it's, uh, it's actually short

29:51.736 --> 29:54.239
for "Moron."

29:54.339 --> 29:56.922
'Cause, uh...

29:57.022 --> 29:59.024
uh, 'cause...

30:02.067 --> 30:03.368
Uh...

30:03.468 --> 30:06.211
You know, people assumed
it'd be short for...

30:08.153 --> 30:09.815
Technical problems.

30:09.915 --> 30:11.917
Uh...

30:12.797 --> 30:15.220
Anybody got an instruction manual?

30:15.320 --> 30:16.701
Nope?

30:16.801 --> 30:19.184
He bombed three times at once.

30:19.284 --> 30:20.844
We're bringing in a firing squad

30:20.846 --> 30:22.848
and they'll put you out of your misery.

30:25.931 --> 30:27.592
Just be honest.

30:27.692 --> 30:30.515
Like-like scale of one to ten,

30:30.615 --> 30:33.398
how bad was that?

30:33.498 --> 30:36.561
Uhh, well, what you want to
hear is that you did okay.

30:36.661 --> 30:39.004
But what you need to
hear is that you sucked.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.525
Which you did.

30:40.625 --> 30:42.567
But that's good, that's
how you get better.

30:42.667 --> 30:44.770
Hey, hey, look at the bright side.

30:44.870 --> 30:46.531
You know, after that performance,

30:46.631 --> 30:48.391
short of one of "Jerry's
kids" coming up on stage

30:48.393 --> 30:52.017
and popping a crutch, you're
a lock for a pity fuck.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.498
I panicked.

30:53.598 --> 30:56.021
I saw Goldie watching, and I just froze.

30:56.121 --> 30:58.243
It-it-it-it was like one of
those-those horror movies

30:58.323 --> 31:01.186
where you try to scream
and-and nothing comes out.

31:01.286 --> 31:02.908
I'm dead. I'm fucking dead.

31:03.008 --> 31:03.949
It's okay, Ronnie.

31:04.049 --> 31:05.430
It's not that big a deal.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.952
Yeah, tell that to Lovis.

31:07.052 --> 31:09.034
He bombed in front of Goldie early on,

31:09.134 --> 31:10.996
and... look what happened to him.

31:13.498 --> 31:16.041
Now, look here, Norton has style.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.283
He shoots that jab right from his hip.

31:18.383 --> 31:21.046
Then he move all herky-jerky.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.986
You know what I'm sayin-saying?
I'm telling you.

31:22.988 --> 31:24.689
Ali gonna have trouble timing that boy.

31:24.789 --> 31:26.629
You watch what I tell you.
You know what I'm saying?

31:26.631 --> 31:28.814
Well, speaking of young,
pretty, and black.

31:30.195 --> 31:31.056
All right, baby.

31:31.156 --> 31:34.779
From Sonja.

31:34.879 --> 31:39.544
Hey, y'all should have seen
this man the other night.

31:39.644 --> 31:41.586
Man, he had the audience
bent with laughter.

31:43.328 --> 31:45.270
I just had a good set, that's all.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.833
Hey, never underestimate

31:47.933 --> 31:49.554
the power of charisma.

31:49.654 --> 31:52.838
And that is something
that you have tenfold.

31:52.938 --> 31:55.240
No matter what Goldie may think.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.402
And she could stick you in
the bottom of the well,

31:57.502 --> 31:58.964
you'd still come up with laughs.

32:00.225 --> 32:01.686
Meaning?

32:01.786 --> 32:04.249
Means she's burying you
in that bullshit cellar.

32:04.349 --> 32:06.611
Hey, man, the Cellar's just
somewhere to hone my style

32:06.711 --> 32:08.653
until it's ready for Main Stage.

32:08.753 --> 32:10.455
Y'all hear this?

32:12.477 --> 32:14.019
The fuck is so funny?

32:14.119 --> 32:16.021
She got you trained. Hmph!

32:16.121 --> 32:17.822
You wanna buy that jive.

32:17.922 --> 32:19.884
But if you want to bury
your light under a bushel

32:19.965 --> 32:23.628
and keep playin' house nigga to
Miss Goldie, that's your call.

32:23.728 --> 32:25.991
Man, why you always gotta
talk shit to make a point?

32:26.091 --> 32:27.931
I'm sorry, Adam, but I
don't decorate the truth

32:27.973 --> 32:29.674
with ribbons and bows.

32:29.774 --> 32:31.716
All right. You want some truth?

32:31.816 --> 32:34.039
Try this shit on.

32:34.139 --> 32:36.281
If you want to make it in comedy,

32:36.381 --> 32:39.444
it's only one place to do that
in L.A., and that's Goldie's.

32:39.544 --> 32:42.047
You sound like you done found Jesus.

32:43.508 --> 32:46.131
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

32:46.231 --> 32:50.055
Maybe I have.

32:50.155 --> 32:51.656
There are other clubs,

32:51.756 --> 32:53.138
just like there are other ways.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.419
Like what?

32:54.519 --> 32:56.101
King Theodore's?

32:56.201 --> 32:58.823
Man can't even pay his liquor bill.

32:58.923 --> 33:00.145
And what does it matter?

33:00.245 --> 33:02.707
Ain't nobody being found there anyways.

33:02.807 --> 33:04.069
I gotta go.

33:08.013 --> 33:11.196
Dating was different after guys
found out my parents were dead.

33:11.296 --> 33:14.159
They became afraid to
use the word "parents."

33:14.259 --> 33:15.580
I'd meet a guy's mother and father

33:15.660 --> 33:17.082
and he'd introduce them to me as,

33:17.182 --> 33:18.461
"the couple who did his laundry."

33:18.463 --> 33:21.406
It's funny.

33:21.506 --> 33:23.408
Goldie wants my parents still breathing,

33:23.508 --> 33:25.450
it being network and all.

33:25.550 --> 33:27.212
Mm, I get that.

33:27.312 --> 33:29.374
So can you save it?

33:29.474 --> 33:30.895
I mean,

33:30.995 --> 33:32.377
Cass, this is your life.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.059
I can be a sounding board and all,

33:34.159 --> 33:35.740
but this is-this is all you.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.960
Yeah, but the stuff she wants
me to say isn't my life.

33:38.043 --> 33:39.945
It's like a cartoon version of my life.

33:40.045 --> 33:43.108
Right.

33:46.931 --> 33:50.035
God, I'm so sick of my stomach

33:50.135 --> 33:52.077
being in knots.

33:52.177 --> 33:55.760
And it's just jokes, right?

33:55.860 --> 33:57.462
Think Henny Youngman pulls his hair out

33:57.542 --> 33:59.444
every time he picks up his fiddle?

33:59.544 --> 34:01.166
Yeah, probably.

34:01.266 --> 34:03.768
I mean, "take my wife... please"

34:03.868 --> 34:05.490
came from someplace.

34:05.590 --> 34:07.312
Henny's wife probably
shit herself laughing

34:07.392 --> 34:08.612
when she first heard it.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.755
- You think?
- Yeah, definitely.

34:14.319 --> 34:15.560
My dad was always disappointed

34:15.639 --> 34:18.382
that I didn't play baseball as a kid.

34:18.483 --> 34:20.425
Harmon Killebrew and Sandy Koufax,

34:20.525 --> 34:23.288
they were heroes in our house.

34:23.368 --> 34:25.248
Jews that could throw the ball,
that was a very big deal.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.312
Hey, you know who you're
talking to, right?

34:27.411 --> 34:30.114
Anyway, I, um...

34:30.215 --> 34:32.197
I got bullied a lot as a kid.

34:32.297 --> 34:35.880
So I was never fully comfortable
around jocks holding bats.

34:35.980 --> 34:37.722
And there was this one day

34:37.822 --> 34:40.245
I was at Fenway with my old man,

34:40.344 --> 34:42.246
about ten years old.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.369
And it was the bottom of the seventh,

34:44.469 --> 34:46.811
and he was extra surly

34:46.911 --> 34:49.654
'cause the Sox were getting creamed

34:49.754 --> 34:52.217
by the fucking Yankees no less.

34:52.317 --> 34:55.100
And he just keeps getting
madder and madder.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.862
And so I look at him
and I say, "Hey, Dad.

34:57.962 --> 34:59.642
What do you call a New
Yorker with a baseball bat

34:59.644 --> 35:02.707
who's covered in baggy pinstripes?

35:02.807 --> 35:04.029
A piece of shit."

35:06.371 --> 35:09.114
Admittedly, it's not
my A material, but...

35:09.214 --> 35:10.435
it's still my favorite.

35:10.535 --> 35:12.357
And why is that?

35:12.457 --> 35:16.681
'Cause it was the first time I
ever made my old man laugh.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.763
Yeah.

35:22.987 --> 35:25.570
Jokes are sacrosanct

35:25.670 --> 35:29.614
because they're never
just jokes, you know?

35:29.714 --> 35:31.856
You are always in there somewhere.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.422
Ooh.

35:37.522 --> 35:40.145
You are one serious fucker.

35:40.245 --> 35:41.506
Oh, that's nothin'.

35:41.606 --> 35:42.927
Wait till you hear my dissertation

35:43.007 --> 35:43.988
on knock-knock jokes.

35:44.088 --> 35:45.270
Oh, yeah?

35:45.370 --> 35:46.490
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

35:46.571 --> 35:48.193
- Nietzsche.
- Nietzsche who?

35:48.293 --> 35:49.692
Eh, fuck it, don't answer,
what's the point?

35:49.694 --> 35:51.636
Life has no intrinsic meaning or value.

35:51.736 --> 35:52.997
I'm sorry I bothered you.

35:53.097 --> 35:54.519
You always make me laugh.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.001
Well, it's my burden.

35:57.101 --> 35:59.103
You're a good friend, Eddie.

36:03.107 --> 36:05.109
Yeah, you too.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.864
<i>Roger Moore is 002 at best.</i>

36:24.168 --> 36:25.430
What's that?

36:25.530 --> 36:28.233
Care package?

36:28.333 --> 36:29.674
From my mom.

36:29.774 --> 36:32.637
Stuff from back home you
can't get out here.

36:37.742 --> 36:38.723
You eat this?

36:38.823 --> 36:40.845
Yep. On bread.

36:40.945 --> 36:44.569
Mix it with peanut butter,
it's called a "fluffernutter."

36:44.669 --> 36:46.531
You okay, Ronnie?

36:46.631 --> 36:47.452
You seem a little...

36:47.552 --> 36:48.373
Down?

36:48.473 --> 36:49.534
Pussy-ish.

36:49.634 --> 36:50.655
Thanks, Maggie.

36:50.755 --> 36:51.715
Seriously.

36:51.756 --> 36:53.218
You should work with children.

36:53.318 --> 36:55.500
Is this still about last night?

36:55.600 --> 36:57.782
You bombed. Move on already.

36:57.882 --> 36:58.983
Maggie, I didn't just bomb.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.665
I bombed in front of fucking Goldie,

37:00.765 --> 37:03.027
the one fucking person that
you can't bomb in front of!

37:03.127 --> 37:04.869
Whoa, whoa, take it down a notch.

37:04.969 --> 37:06.751
I'm not the one who sucked last night.

37:06.851 --> 37:08.433
You know what, Mags?

37:08.533 --> 37:09.874
Fuck you.

37:09.974 --> 37:11.436
You know what else?

37:11.536 --> 37:13.095
Why don't you wear some
fucking pants to breakfast

37:13.097 --> 37:14.919
like a normal person, okay?

37:15.019 --> 37:16.120
'Cause we get it.

37:16.220 --> 37:18.403
You have a vagina.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.514
Really?

37:31.596 --> 37:34.018
Hey, you get through to Sonny Bueno?

37:34.118 --> 37:36.120
They're at rehearsal.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.584
Sorry, man.

37:39.684 --> 37:42.427
I was... I was really
hoping you'd get us sprung

37:42.527 --> 37:44.709
because I gotta take a shit,

37:44.809 --> 37:47.752
and I can't take a shit in
public, no fucking way.

37:47.852 --> 37:49.754
I mean, y- You wouldn't understand

37:49.854 --> 37:52.016
'cause a guy like you can
take a dump anywhere, right?

37:52.096 --> 37:54.399
I truly envy that.

37:54.499 --> 37:56.921
What's it like, Edgar?

37:57.021 --> 37:59.644
Being so wrapped up in yourself
that you don't give a fuck

37:59.744 --> 38:03.007
about anybody else?

38:03.107 --> 38:04.489
I care about people.

38:04.589 --> 38:06.931
Who do you give a
motherfucking two shits about

38:07.031 --> 38:08.853
other than yourself?

38:08.953 --> 38:10.014
I care about my friends.

38:10.114 --> 38:12.016
What friends?

38:12.116 --> 38:14.839
The people you sell drugs to?
Those are customers.

38:14.919 --> 38:17.622
You don't have any fucking friends.

38:17.722 --> 38:18.623
Ralph,

38:18.723 --> 38:21.746
I fucked up, okay?

38:21.846 --> 38:24.949
But that does not mean I
don't care about people.

38:25.049 --> 38:27.111
You know what we used
to call motherfuckers

38:27.211 --> 38:28.553
like you in the army?

38:30.335 --> 38:31.876
"Jack."

38:31.976 --> 38:33.958
That's a special term of contempt

38:34.058 --> 38:35.480
reserved for those

38:35.580 --> 38:38.483
who only look out for
themselves and not their mates.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.445
That's you, Edgar.

38:40.545 --> 38:44.569
A Jack motherfucker,
through and through.

38:44.669 --> 38:45.570
Ralph.

38:45.670 --> 38:47.812
I am so fucking sorry, man.

38:47.912 --> 38:49.311
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Hey, hey.

38:49.313 --> 38:52.477
- Get your ass in a fucking...
- Knock it off!

38:52.557 --> 38:55.099
Both of you!

38:55.199 --> 38:57.061
It's all right, Officer.

38:57.161 --> 39:00.865
Think it's a Vietnam thing.

39:00.965 --> 39:02.347
You tour there?

39:02.447 --> 39:04.509
Twice.

39:04.609 --> 39:05.470
Who you with?

39:05.570 --> 39:07.592
75th Infantry Rangers.

39:07.692 --> 39:10.395
Sergeant Major Ralph
Carnegie, Company C.

39:10.495 --> 39:13.117
Sergeant Jerry Barnsdale.

39:13.217 --> 39:15.680
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.362
Find 'em, track 'em, kill 'em.

39:17.462 --> 39:19.364
What happened here, Sergeant?

39:19.464 --> 39:20.765
Wrong place, wrong time,

39:20.865 --> 39:23.768
wrong person to get a fucking ride from.

39:23.868 --> 39:25.209
He's right, Officer.

39:25.309 --> 39:28.293
He did not have anything
to do with this, okay?

39:28.393 --> 39:31.376
He's a comedian; he's gonna
open for Sonny and Cher.

39:31.476 --> 39:35.620
He barely drinks alcohol.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.021
How'd you pull that off?

39:40.845 --> 39:43.748
Anyone ever tell you you're
a real piece of shit?

39:43.848 --> 39:46.411
Yeah. I stopped counting.

39:50.895 --> 39:53.638
We haven't processed you yet.

39:53.738 --> 39:57.402
If you were released now,
it's like it never happened.

39:57.502 --> 39:58.683
You serious?

39:58.783 --> 40:00.084
I mean, I can make my gig.

40:00.184 --> 40:02.286
This offer doesn't extend to him.

40:04.388 --> 40:05.570
I'm good with that.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.453
Ralph, Ralph.

40:08.553 --> 40:10.074
It was me bringing up your Vietnam shit

40:10.154 --> 40:11.976
that got you out of here.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.778
Come on, you gotta...

40:13.878 --> 40:15.660
You gotta get somebody, Ralph.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.702
Don't leave me in here.

40:17.802 --> 40:20.825
Ralph, please, come on, Ralph.

40:20.925 --> 40:23.307
You're on your own, Jack.

40:39.423 --> 40:40.965
Buy you a drink, sailor?

40:41.065 --> 40:43.127
Seriously, again?

40:43.227 --> 40:45.009
What are you talking about?

40:45.109 --> 40:47.509
I don't know if someone told you
that I'm dying or something,

40:47.552 --> 40:49.734
but save your good works.

40:49.834 --> 40:51.175
It's a fucking beer, Bill.

40:51.275 --> 40:52.937
And the agent the other night?

40:53.037 --> 40:54.258
I was throwing you a bone.

40:54.358 --> 40:56.861
You think I need you to throw me a bone?

40:56.961 --> 40:58.863
Did you come out of the womb an asshole?

41:00.765 --> 41:02.387
Go fuck yourself.

41:02.487 --> 41:05.109
Jesus, no wonder Cassie dumped your ass.

41:05.209 --> 41:07.151
- What the...
- Oh, motherfucker.

41:07.251 --> 41:10.154
Oh, you pussy, I barely touched you.

41:10.254 --> 41:12.557
Jesus Christ, Nick.

41:12.657 --> 41:14.659
Oh, fuck, not now.

41:16.340 --> 41:18.202
Come on.

41:18.302 --> 41:19.604
<i>Anyway,</i>

41:19.704 --> 41:22.407
days blurred when I was drinkin'.

41:22.507 --> 41:25.610
Holidays, birthdays.

41:25.710 --> 41:27.131
Now that I'm sober,

41:27.231 --> 41:29.293
they're all too clear.

41:29.393 --> 41:31.656
It sure was a lot
easier to face your day

41:31.756 --> 41:36.320
when you weren't sure what
day it was you were facin'.

41:44.689 --> 41:46.931
Hey. You wanna go up?

41:58.342 --> 41:59.764
Hi, uh, my name's Ron

41:59.864 --> 42:01.866
and I, uh...

42:06.911 --> 42:10.735
My name is Ron

42:10.835 --> 42:13.337
and I-I-I'm not an alcoholic.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.862
Uh, believe me,

42:17.962 --> 42:20.745
I wish I was because then
at least I could point to

42:20.845 --> 42:24.228
something I was successful at.

42:25.770 --> 42:28.613
Here's some rigorous honesty.

42:30.815 --> 42:34.479
I have been coming here to
work on my stand-up comedy.

42:34.579 --> 42:37.361
I've been using all you as guinea pigs

42:37.461 --> 42:40.084
while I stand up here
and make up stories...

42:40.184 --> 42:42.767
Jokes. I make up jokes

42:42.867 --> 42:44.849
about being an alcoholic.

42:48.192 --> 42:50.194
It's fucking pathetic.

42:51.956 --> 42:53.738
I have no idea what it is

42:53.838 --> 42:55.840
I'm-I'm doing anymore.

43:01.005 --> 43:02.667
Wait, Ron.

43:02.767 --> 43:04.068
What?

43:04.168 --> 43:06.611
You sure that's all you wanted to share?

43:09.413 --> 43:11.916
Oh. Yeah, um...

43:12.016 --> 43:13.237
I'm really sorry.

43:13.337 --> 43:14.398
No, no.

43:14.498 --> 43:17.041
What I mean is

43:17.141 --> 43:20.164
maybe you <i>need</i> to be here.

43:20.264 --> 43:24.048
So why not use this room
as it was intended,

43:24.148 --> 43:26.911
a place to share your truth?

43:30.715 --> 43:32.717
My truth.

43:41.445 --> 43:43.447
Um...

43:44.288 --> 43:46.711
Okay. Well...

43:46.811 --> 43:48.192
when I was in high school,

43:48.292 --> 43:50.795
I was this overweight dork.

43:50.895 --> 43:53.117
And, I mean, I had some friends, but

43:53.217 --> 43:56.881
I was never what you'd
describe as "popular."

43:56.981 --> 44:01.806
Um, I ate alone a lot.
Like-like a real lot.

44:01.906 --> 44:06.170
And I guess I've always kind of thought

44:06.270 --> 44:10.294
if I could be this,
uh, this other thing,

44:10.394 --> 44:13.818
like this-this better, funny thing,

44:13.918 --> 44:16.380
uh, that-that people would
treat me different,

44:16.480 --> 44:20.144
you-you know, be nicer or whatever.

44:20.244 --> 44:22.987
And-and you know, and if...
If this better

44:23.087 --> 44:25.389
if this better, funny thing

44:25.489 --> 44:27.351
was really special,

44:27.451 --> 44:29.353
you know, it could... It could...

44:29.453 --> 44:31.555
it could get you out of there.

44:31.655 --> 44:33.517
And people-people would see you

44:33.617 --> 44:37.962
as that thing.

44:38.062 --> 44:40.164
You know, instead of this thing.

44:42.626 --> 44:43.808
Um...

44:46.430 --> 44:48.052
But... Ha.

44:48.152 --> 44:51.035
But now I know that there
is no other thing.

44:53.517 --> 44:55.840
And it scares the shit out of me.

44:58.963 --> 45:02.106
You know, just knowing that this...

45:02.206 --> 45:04.789
This identity that I

45:04.889 --> 45:07.952
banked on

45:08.052 --> 45:11.355
giving my life its meaning

45:11.455 --> 45:13.357
was bullshit.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.283
It's all bullshit.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.767
And all that's left

45:22.867 --> 45:25.209
is me.

45:33.517 --> 45:35.519
That's all.

45:39.764 --> 45:41.906
You still clap.

45:42.006 --> 45:44.008
Thank you.

45:46.450 --> 45:48.673
<i>- Am I right or am I right?</i>
<i>- You're wrong.</i>

45:48.773 --> 45:50.995
<i>House of Pies is way
better than this shit.</i>

45:51.095 --> 45:52.775
<i>- Are you fuckin' kidding?</i>
<i>- No, I'm dead serious.</i>

45:52.777 --> 45:54.016
<i>You're not even eating the crust.</i>

45:54.018 --> 45:55.319
<i>The crust is the best part.</i>

45:55.419 --> 45:57.241
<i>Because I don't like to eat shit.</i>

45:57.341 --> 45:58.941
<i>This is the only reason
I come back to Los Angeles.</i>

45:58.943 --> 46:00.302
- Mmm.
- If you're done

46:00.304 --> 46:01.543
with your pie now, can
we go to the hospital

46:01.545 --> 46:02.785
and get your fucking arm looked at?

46:02.787 --> 46:05.529
Jesus, Mom. I told you, it's a cyst.

46:05.629 --> 46:07.211
Can you just relax?

46:07.311 --> 46:08.572
I'm overreacting?

46:08.672 --> 46:10.014
- Yeah.
- I hit you in the arm,

46:10.114 --> 46:12.016
and you howl like I found your G-spot.

46:12.116 --> 46:14.618
Come on.

46:14.718 --> 46:16.260
Where's... hey.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.421
Thank you.

46:21.325 --> 46:22.186
What are you doing?

46:22.286 --> 46:24.668
Don't worry about it.

46:24.768 --> 46:27.712
- Oh.
- A little for Mr. William.

46:27.812 --> 46:29.273
And a little for Nicky.

46:29.373 --> 46:32.917
Whoops.

46:33.017 --> 46:34.959
Hey, look, I'm sorry about
what I said about, uh,

46:35.059 --> 46:36.560
Cassie dumping you.

46:36.660 --> 46:38.883
Yeah, I'm sorry that you got
the world by the balls,

46:38.983 --> 46:41.165
but you're too much of
a fuck-up to cash in.

46:41.265 --> 46:43.447
Wow.

46:43.547 --> 46:46.170
Just so you know, that is <i>not</i>
how you get in my pants.

46:46.270 --> 46:48.172
No?

46:48.272 --> 46:51.175
All right, let's go to the
doctor; I got shit to do.

46:51.275 --> 46:52.176
Man,

46:52.276 --> 46:54.859
What?

46:54.959 --> 46:57.541
What are you so fucking
pissed off about?

46:57.641 --> 46:59.503
You really resent my success that much?

46:59.603 --> 47:02.466
Your success?

47:02.566 --> 47:04.006
Maybe I just don't think you're funny.

47:04.008 --> 47:06.370
Tell that to Carson. And we all have

47:06.450 --> 47:08.352
our special little
gifts, don't we, Nick?

47:08.452 --> 47:10.674
Look, I'm so much fucking
funnier than you.

47:10.774 --> 47:12.334
And you just so happen
to be better than me

47:12.336 --> 47:14.136
at being in the right
place at the right time.

47:14.138 --> 47:16.000
- Hm.
- Plus you didn't get the couch.

47:16.100 --> 47:18.282
They ran long.

47:18.382 --> 47:19.563
Fuckin' Joan Embery.

47:19.663 --> 47:20.925
What's that tell ya?

47:21.025 --> 47:22.264
Carson would rather
have a three-toed sloth

47:22.266 --> 47:24.248
piss all over his jacket

47:24.348 --> 47:26.070
then spend ten seconds
chatting with you.

47:26.150 --> 47:27.709
You really think you're funnier than me?

47:27.711 --> 47:30.054
The fucking Zapruder film
is funnier than you, Nick.

47:30.154 --> 47:31.776
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

47:31.876 --> 47:35.219
'Cause I always thought the
beginning kind of meandered.

47:35.319 --> 47:37.701
Excuse me, uh, Doris?

47:37.801 --> 47:39.263
Would you solve something for us?

47:39.363 --> 47:41.163
If we both tell you a joke, will
you let us know who's funniest?

47:41.165 --> 47:43.227
Who's paying?

47:43.327 --> 47:45.329
He is.

47:47.091 --> 47:49.193
She's the funniest.

47:49.293 --> 47:50.955
Yeah.

47:54.899 --> 47:56.320
Oh.

47:56.420 --> 47:58.562
I told you I got a new
tranny for my car.

47:58.662 --> 48:00.462
Yeah, I didn't know they were
putting them on the outside now.

48:00.464 --> 48:02.166
- Yeah, they are.
- Hey, blue eyes.

48:02.266 --> 48:03.968
You looking for a date?

48:04.068 --> 48:06.028
Oh-ho, I'm all set, but
thank you, Scrotum O'Neil.

48:07.551 --> 48:10.014
I loved <i>Paper Moon.</i> You funny.

48:10.114 --> 48:11.655
Ooh, two for two, baby.

48:11.755 --> 48:13.435
That's not fucking funny...
Ask me on a date.

48:13.437 --> 48:14.778
Oh, you want a date, Red?

48:14.878 --> 48:16.278
You know what? I would,
but I promised myself

48:16.280 --> 48:17.879
I would not get involved
with another woman

48:17.881 --> 48:20.244
whose cock is bigger than mine.

48:20.324 --> 48:21.986
- Good one.
- Hey, all beef,

48:22.086 --> 48:24.308
if I wanted to pay 20 bucks
to get fucked in the ass,

48:24.408 --> 48:26.750
I'd just buy a ticket to a
Loggins and Messina concert.

48:28.012 --> 48:29.713
Yeah, I do want to take
you out on a date.

48:29.813 --> 48:31.493
Me, you, and a quiet table at
the Hollywood free clinic.

48:31.495 --> 48:32.917
- What do you say, huh?
- Ooh.

48:33.017 --> 48:34.198
- No?
- Ooh.

48:34.298 --> 48:35.497
I mean, I thought that was funny.

48:35.499 --> 48:37.081
- Thanks, man. Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:37.181 --> 48:38.780
Hey, if it's a loveless
fuck you're looking for,

48:38.782 --> 48:40.182
maybe it's time you finally
call your father back.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.445
- Ooh.
- Shit.

48:41.545 --> 48:43.027
That's your daddy he's talking about.

48:43.107 --> 48:45.449
- Okay, okay, stop.
- You both funny.

48:45.549 --> 48:47.932
Yeah, we know we're both
funny, but who's funnier?

48:48.032 --> 48:49.093
Well, shit,

48:49.193 --> 48:50.654
junkie's the funniest, I guess.

48:50.754 --> 48:52.394
- What'd you call me?
- Hey, man, back up.

48:52.436 --> 48:54.698
- I ain't judging.
- Yeah? Fuck you, cocksucker.

48:54.798 --> 48:56.358
And fuck
you, motherfucker.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.102
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Look at your arm, man.

48:58.202 --> 48:59.601
It's abscessed... it's
comin' through your shirt.

48:59.603 --> 49:00.963
Oh, oh, I'm sorry to
give away your secret.

49:00.965 --> 49:02.426
Yeah? Fuck you.

49:02.526 --> 49:03.685
All right, you know what?
Nobody's funny.

49:03.687 --> 49:04.726
- How bout that, okay?
- No, no.

49:04.728 --> 49:06.230
Let your bitch-ass friend go.

49:06.330 --> 49:08.672
I'll cut his motherfucking
junkie throat.

49:08.772 --> 49:10.434
Hey, hey, get in the fucking car.

49:10.534 --> 49:12.254
All right, thank you, ladies.
Have a good night.

49:12.256 --> 49:14.096
Enjoy the repercussions
of your life decisions.

49:14.138 --> 49:15.439
The truth is

49:15.539 --> 49:17.882
you're both some unfunny,
sorry-ass faggots.

49:17.982 --> 49:19.603
Quite a compliment. Thank you so much.

49:19.703 --> 49:21.365
That's the damn truth, bitch.

49:21.465 --> 49:23.385
Why don't you go suck
off the rest of The Supremes?

49:23.387 --> 49:25.187
- I got you some Supremes...
- You look like Jimi Hendrix

49:25.189 --> 49:26.991
with fetal alcohol syndrome,
you motherfucker!

49:27.071 --> 49:28.692
Yeah, any fuckin' time!

49:28.792 --> 49:31.815
I, for one, am okay with women
breastfeeding in public.

49:31.915 --> 49:33.697
As long as they're
okay with me watching.

49:33.797 --> 49:36.660
Speaking of watching...

49:36.760 --> 49:40.144
Man, I could get used
to having this many people here.

49:40.244 --> 49:41.865
You deserve it.

49:41.965 --> 49:43.427
Your stuff's great.

49:43.527 --> 49:46.430
You're gonna kill.

49:46.530 --> 49:48.232
Thank you.

49:48.332 --> 49:49.313
For what?

49:49.413 --> 49:51.555
Oh, for being such a nice guy.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.877
Ladies and gentlemen,
the lovely Cassie Feder.

49:53.977 --> 49:56.040
You ever think that maybe
I'm not that nice a guy?

49:56.140 --> 49:57.561
Not for a second.

50:02.946 --> 50:04.248
Whoo!

50:04.348 --> 50:06.450
Gabe Schwartz,
ladies and gentlemen.

50:08.352 --> 50:11.635
So I'm sure you
can tell where I'm from.

50:14.318 --> 50:16.900
- It's good?
- Yeah.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.742
- Hey?
- Hm?

50:18.842 --> 50:20.844
You're bleeding again.

50:23.287 --> 50:24.606
You want me to take you
to that emergency room

50:24.608 --> 50:27.271
or should we get ice cream this time?

50:27.371 --> 50:29.373
I'm good.

50:32.496 --> 50:34.198
You know, that shit turned Lenny Bruce

50:34.298 --> 50:36.840
into a strung-out court stenographer.

50:36.940 --> 50:38.322
Not that I'm comparing you

50:38.422 --> 50:42.806
in any way, shape, or form to Lenny.

50:42.906 --> 50:45.769
Can't all be Soupy Sales, Bill.

50:50.554 --> 50:52.336
It's a fucking crutch.

50:52.436 --> 50:54.058
You don't need it.

50:54.158 --> 50:58.382
Pain is
essential, and you know it.

50:58.482 --> 51:00.964
All we are is agony as art.

51:07.931 --> 51:10.194
Who the fuck talks like that?

51:10.294 --> 51:13.117
Really?

51:13.217 --> 51:16.480
Nobody gives a fuck about
the depths of your soul.

51:19.223 --> 51:20.924
It's about funny.

51:21.024 --> 51:23.607
It's about money, fame,

51:23.707 --> 51:27.091
and getting laid by women
way out of our league.

51:28.352 --> 51:31.215
Spoken like a true hack.

51:31.315 --> 51:32.456
Well, so what?

51:32.556 --> 51:35.179
I'm supposed to be like you and Clay?

51:35.279 --> 51:37.521
Shooting fucking heroin and
then jump in front of a bus

51:37.601 --> 51:39.223
just as the spotlight hits?

51:41.565 --> 51:43.667
You don't deserve any of
the good that's falling

51:43.767 --> 51:45.949
into your aggressively untalented lap.

51:46.049 --> 51:47.871
Wait, what are you talking about?

51:47.971 --> 51:50.354
Clay was an accident.

51:54.618 --> 51:56.800
Don't be a fucking idiot, Nick.

51:58.222 --> 51:59.423
Clay walked against the light

51:59.503 --> 52:00.902
and jumped in front of a speeding bus.

52:00.904 --> 52:02.166
People saw it.

52:10.514 --> 52:13.057
You're a fucking cunt, Nick.

52:15.439 --> 52:16.540
A real asshole.

52:18.402 --> 52:20.284
Which probably means we'll
be friends for life.

52:20.364 --> 52:22.786
So wake the fuck up.

52:22.886 --> 52:25.549
Be funny.

52:25.649 --> 52:27.231
Not everyone cares

52:27.331 --> 52:30.914
about the darkness that
keeps you up at night.

52:31.014 --> 52:33.557
All right, that's my time.
You guys have been great.

52:33.657 --> 52:34.678
Thank you.

52:36.700 --> 52:39.323
Keep it going,
ladies and gentlemen.

52:42.426 --> 52:44.208
Hi. How are you, sweetheart?

52:44.308 --> 52:46.570
Good. Whatever joke he just told you

52:46.670 --> 52:48.372
that you were laughing at,

52:48.472 --> 52:50.374
just know he probably stole it.

52:50.474 --> 52:52.616
Okay? Have a good night.

52:54.117 --> 52:56.540
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please move.

52:56.640 --> 52:58.342
Get the fuck out of the way...

53:04.368 --> 53:05.487
More demand for the Cellar tonight

53:05.489 --> 53:07.231
than there is for the main room.

53:07.331 --> 53:09.953
You are gonna get me in so much
trouble with the fire marshal.

53:10.053 --> 53:13.557
Spending more time killing it in
the Cellar than Norman Bates.

53:13.657 --> 53:16.360
This next kid, he's
like a <i>Raisin in the Sun</i> to me.

53:16.460 --> 53:18.762
Give it up for Adam Proteau,
give it up, everybody.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.124
Come on, Adam.

53:23.787 --> 53:25.048
Whoo!

53:27.951 --> 53:29.993
<i>♪ You're going to reap...
♪</i> Oh, shit, now.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.741
Six, though, six?

53:37.841 --> 53:40.584
We saw six Ping-Pong balls
come out of her vagina.

53:40.684 --> 53:41.963
- Shut up.
- Here's the real trick though.

53:41.965 --> 53:43.567
The seventh one came out of her asshole.

53:44.848 --> 53:46.850
I'm serious.

53:48.612 --> 53:49.913
Hey.

53:50.013 --> 53:52.035
What the fuck was that, huh?

53:52.135 --> 53:53.277
- Uhh!
- Oh, shit!

53:53.377 --> 53:54.678
- Oh, oh.
- Hey-hey-hey-hey.

53:54.778 --> 53:56.418
Hey, hey, what the hell
was that for, huh?

53:56.420 --> 53:58.282
He stole my joke!

53:58.382 --> 54:00.342
He didn't steal your shitty
joke, that's in your head.

54:00.344 --> 54:03.006
You're the last person who knows
what's in my fucking head, okay?

54:03.106 --> 54:04.826
You think you're some
great mystery, kid, huh?

54:04.828 --> 54:06.348
You think I don't know you're
trying to fuck Cassie?

54:06.350 --> 54:07.491
- Fuck you I am...
- Fuck me?

54:07.591 --> 54:08.492
Hey, hey.

54:08.592 --> 54:09.573
Oh, shit.

54:09.673 --> 54:11.054
Hey, enough, enough.

54:11.154 --> 54:12.514
You both got your licks in.
Jesus, Kenny...

54:12.516 --> 54:13.555
- Fucking little putz!
- Hey.

54:15.359 --> 54:17.118
I didn't know he's moving
on your girlfriend, Bill.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.422
You know what? I'm glad.

54:18.522 --> 54:20.123
I'm glad I stole your
shitty little joke!

54:20.203 --> 54:21.825
Fuck.

54:21.925 --> 54:22.666
What?

54:22.766 --> 54:24.388
Fuck him, man.

54:24.488 --> 54:26.127
Only scum tries to steal
another guy's girl.

54:26.129 --> 54:27.671
But you did steal his joke?

54:27.771 --> 54:29.250
Yeah, it wasn't even that
good of a joke, man.

54:29.252 --> 54:30.572
Some stupid fucking baseball thing.

54:30.574 --> 54:32.356
You know what? Not one call,

54:32.456 --> 54:35.639
not one call complimenting me on it.

54:35.739 --> 54:37.441
Oh!

54:39.423 --> 54:41.705
Hey, you don't steal another
guy's fucking joke, asshole.

54:41.785 --> 54:43.487
Ow, Nick!

54:43.587 --> 54:45.729
Nicky. Ah, Nicky.

54:45.829 --> 54:47.028
- Fucking thief.
- Ah, no-no-no...

54:48.271 --> 54:49.150
- Come here.
- But, Red, man...

54:49.152 --> 54:50.414
Where you going, huh?

54:50.514 --> 54:52.055
- Oh!
- Okay-okay-okay-

54:52.155 --> 54:53.457
Billy, Billy...

54:53.557 --> 54:55.219
Ah! Oh...

54:55.319 --> 54:56.700
So, uh, who we kicking?

54:56.800 --> 55:00.344
Hey. What happened?

55:00.444 --> 55:02.826
Are you okay?

55:06.330 --> 55:07.511
We're not friends.

55:07.611 --> 55:08.832
That's what happened.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.374
You okay?

55:30.474 --> 55:31.715
Maggie, as it stands right now,

55:31.795 --> 55:33.114
any more warmth and kindness from you,

55:33.116 --> 55:35.118
and I might slit my wrists, so...

55:40.163 --> 55:42.386
- I'm sorry about earlier.
- No, I'm...

55:42.486 --> 55:43.725
I shouldn't have blown up on ya.

55:43.727 --> 55:45.549
I'm sorry, Ronnie, I was a bitch.

55:45.649 --> 55:47.511
And I promise from now on

55:47.611 --> 55:49.673
I will always wear pants at breakfast.

55:49.773 --> 55:52.115
Please don't.

55:52.215 --> 55:53.855
Breakfast is only the most
important meal of the day

55:53.857 --> 55:55.298
'cause you show up to it pants-less.

55:59.703 --> 56:01.445
Mmm.

56:01.545 --> 56:03.046
Actually looks kind of yummy.

56:03.146 --> 56:04.648
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

56:16.159 --> 56:17.100
Interesting.

56:18.642 --> 56:20.143
My mom always used to make 'em for me

56:20.243 --> 56:21.425
when I'd have a bad day.

56:21.525 --> 56:24.788
Mm, for me it was grape ZaRex.

56:24.888 --> 56:26.770
Mm. It's funny how sometimes
those little things

56:26.850 --> 56:28.271
can make you forget.

56:28.371 --> 56:30.554
Forget what?

56:30.654 --> 56:32.556
I don't know.

56:32.656 --> 56:36.560
Everything.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.682
Don't let the shit get you down, Ronnie.

56:38.782 --> 56:40.484
You gotta ease up, okay?

56:40.584 --> 56:41.885
As my dad used to say,

56:41.985 --> 56:45.108
"Good things happen when
you lighten your grip."

56:47.310 --> 56:49.473
Obviously he wasn't
masturbating when he said that.

56:50.674 --> 56:52.676
No.

56:59.162 --> 57:00.544
Hey, hey, hey.

57:00.644 --> 57:03.487
Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Whoa.

57:03.567 --> 57:05.687
You might want to wheel that
delivery back out of here.

57:05.689 --> 57:07.591
Unless it's Christmas.

57:07.691 --> 57:08.952
Uh, is this King Theodore's?

57:09.052 --> 57:11.355
Yeah, you got the right place,

57:11.455 --> 57:15.118
but, uh, I, uh,

57:15.218 --> 57:17.921
I can't afford to pay
you right now, hoss.

57:18.021 --> 57:19.723
No need. It's already paid.

57:23.467 --> 57:26.129
