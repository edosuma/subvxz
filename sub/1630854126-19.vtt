WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.003
Here it is.
Item number seven

00:03.003 --> 00:04.221
of next week's
school board meeting.

00:04.221 --> 00:06.658
A proposal to transition
Abbott Elementary

00:06.658 --> 00:09.444
into a Legendary Charter School
for the 2023-24 school year.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.750
Times New Roman,
the most decisive of the fonts.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.100
Well,
I guess that's it.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.362
Draemond goes to
the school board,

00:14.362 --> 00:15.406
we become a charter.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.581
This is horrible.

00:16.581 --> 00:17.887
I can't be
a charter teacher.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.410
I-I don't have
the wardrobe for it.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.412
School district's gonna
hang us out to dry yet again.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.327
Can't we call the teacher's
union or something?

00:23.327 --> 00:26.635
All they can do is help us
find a job at another public.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.941
I was really hoping
that I had gotten through

00:28.941 --> 00:30.508
to that young man.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.249
As his former teacher,
I thought that Draemond

00:32.249 --> 00:33.946
would take my words to heart.

00:33.946 --> 00:36.819
But now we don't know
who will be asked to stay

00:36.819 --> 00:38.560
and who will be
forced to leave,

00:38.560 --> 00:41.171
and that goes for
teachers <i>and</i> students.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.695
I know that this seems
really, really bad,

00:43.695 --> 00:45.262
but look, no matter
what happens,

00:45.262 --> 00:47.177
we are still
Abbott Elementary.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.005
You know, they can't take
that away from us.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.268
Just found out we're not gonna
be Abbott Elementary anymore.

00:51.268 --> 00:54.141
Draemond is changing the name
to "Legendary Schools Presents:

00:54.141 --> 00:55.272
Abbott Charter."

00:55.272 --> 00:56.969
What in
the Lee Daniels?

00:56.969 --> 01:00.495
I mean...

01:00.495 --> 01:01.496
Wait, I don't get it.

01:01.496 --> 01:02.497
You know what? No.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.281
This is not happening.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.326
Not on our watch.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.544
- Yeah, that's right.
- Right?

01:06.544 --> 01:07.676
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, no.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.373
We can do something
about this.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.419
- Who is Lee Daniels?
- Yes.
We're gonna fight back.

01:11.419 --> 01:12.594
Yes!
- Of course!
- Phone voice: <i>Here is what
I found for Lee Daniels.</i>

01:12.594 --> 01:14.074
<i>African Amer--</i>

01:30.742 --> 01:32.396
That's what needs
to happen.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.572
Operation Save The School
starts now.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.183
Okay, I'm gonna staple
all the info

01:36.183 --> 01:37.706
about what's going on
to the kids' clothes

01:37.706 --> 01:39.055
- so the parents see it.
- Nice.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.709
I'm gonna butter up
Delisha Sloss

01:40.709 --> 01:42.537
like a hot dinner roll

01:42.537 --> 01:45.017
and see what she can do for us
on the school board level.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.194
And I am gonna talk
to every parent I see

01:47.194 --> 01:49.239
and tell them
what Legendary is up to.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.199
When they find out, they are
going to storm the gates... Mm.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.504
...of the school board.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.115
- If they have gates there.
- Wait.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.247
We can hardly get parents
to come to the Open House.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.206
I don't think you're gonna get
that many at drop off.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.426
Oh, no, I'm <i>very</i> good
at canvassing.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.775
People always
open the door for me

02:03.775 --> 02:05.429
'cause they think
I'm a lost child.

02:07.431 --> 02:08.954
Oh, Ava,
you look great.

02:08.954 --> 02:11.087
It'd be
breaking news if I didn't.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.219
Where are you headed?

02:12.219 --> 02:13.568
To handle my business.

02:13.568 --> 02:14.699
I would tell
y'all my plan,

02:14.699 --> 02:16.092
but then it'd
be compromised

02:16.092 --> 02:18.790
and this walk off
wouldn't be as enticing.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.404
Oh, hey! You're
the mom with the bi--

02:23.404 --> 02:24.709
Mm.
You're Krystal, right?

02:24.709 --> 02:25.841
Yep.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.364
- Oh, cute look.
- Thank you.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.409
You should let me
hook you up with my brand.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.453
We just released our line

02:29.453 --> 02:30.933
of extra-petite bitch.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.413
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.805
Listen, I'm trying
to spread the word

02:33.805 --> 02:35.416
about Draemond Winding
and Legendary Charter--

02:35.416 --> 02:36.547
Oh, let me stop you
right there.

02:36.547 --> 02:38.114
I read about that
on Facebook.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.724
Look, I'm all for keeping
the schools public.

02:39.724 --> 02:40.943
What do you need?

02:40.943 --> 02:43.554
Wow, that was so easy.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.295
Man, I had a whole
presentation prepared,

02:45.295 --> 02:47.079
and if that didn't work, begging.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.212
Well, keep me updated.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.387
Look, take my e-mail--
Okay.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.607
It's S-L-U...Oh, you know what?

02:52.607 --> 02:54.043
Actually, I can get it
from Venus,

02:54.043 --> 02:55.349
'cause I'm sure
she has it.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.437
Alright,
Miss Teagues. Teagues.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.438
Okay.
Nice to meet you.

02:57.438 --> 02:58.787
Nice to see you.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.876
I've got good news,

03:00.876 --> 03:02.573
and I've got bad news.

03:02.573 --> 03:06.055
The good news is every day
is a blessing.

03:06.055 --> 03:09.189
The bad news is Draemond
has already buttered up

03:09.189 --> 03:12.366
Delisha Sloss like a freshly
cooked piece of corn on the cob.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.410
Son of a bitch!

03:13.410 --> 03:15.064
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.761
I'm-- This whole situation's
got me on edge.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.633
My night terrors have spread
into day terrors.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.112
I can't tell
if I'm asleep right now,

03:20.112 --> 03:21.288
or if this is some
kind of waking nightmare.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.637
Like, you know...

03:22.637 --> 03:24.291
I think I might
be saving Abbott.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.031
I already got
a parent on board,

03:26.031 --> 03:27.424
and I didn't even have
to fake cry.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.947
Or real cry.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.514
The bell went off before
I could get more signatures,

03:30.514 --> 03:32.342
but the parents
want to help.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.388
We just have to engage them.
So, who's with me?

03:34.388 --> 03:36.216
I'll do it with you
after school, Janine.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.434
Oh!

03:37.434 --> 03:39.958
Uh, I mean I'll get
engaged with you.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.438
With the parents.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.874
- We're gonna get signatures.
- Yes, we are. Yes.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.789
- Who-- Who else?
- Yes! Alright, I'm with you.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.182
Yeah,
so are we.

03:46.182 --> 03:49.272
I'm not loved by
all of the parents,

03:49.272 --> 03:50.839
uh, except for the one
that calls me Stuart Little.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.667
But even that, I'm not sure
is the compliment

03:52.667 --> 03:54.016
I want it to be.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.452
Okay, you hold down
the fort here,

03:55.452 --> 03:57.498
and the rest of us
will go car to car together.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.151
Yes!
Yes! <i>Si se puede!</i>

03:59.151 --> 04:00.631
Yes! <i>Si se p--</i>
Yes!

04:00.631 --> 04:02.024
- Actually, no.
- Um... no.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.852
- No, no, no.
- We've got
three more classes.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.593
Yeah, okay.
We'll do it after school.

04:05.593 --> 04:06.811
'Cause I'm about to pick
the kids up now...

04:06.811 --> 04:08.596
Hello. Hey. Hi!

04:08.596 --> 04:10.685
Sorry, I'm not interested in
saving the whales or whatever.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.469
Oh, no.
I mean, neither am I.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.992
I don't get the hype.
It's like seahorses--

04:13.992 --> 04:15.864
Uh, sorry, that's not
what we're here to talk about.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.866
So, I want to talk to you
about making a change.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.346
I don't believe
in climate change.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.825
Uh, alarming, but no.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.349
Actually, I'm talking
about saving Abbott.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.220
Ugh, I was more interested
in the whales.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.049
Okay, I just need
a little bit of your time.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.617
I don't understand. I thought
Abbott was already a charter.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.053
Actually, it's complicated,
but if you coul--

04:31.053 --> 04:32.533
Well, unless you can
uncomplicate it,

04:32.533 --> 04:33.795
I gotta get to work.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.231
But I--
Come on, come on.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.668
Hey!

04:37.668 --> 04:39.017
Are you the teacher
that stapled that letter

04:39.017 --> 04:40.497
to my son's
brand-new jacket?

04:40.497 --> 04:42.020
Jacob!

04:42.020 --> 04:45.807
I told you, quit stapling stuff
to the kids.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.809
Excuse me, miss.
I was wondering--

04:47.809 --> 04:50.115
Oh, hey, Erika.
Hey, Greg.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.074
What you doing out here,
begging for money?

04:52.074 --> 04:53.293
I told you I can
get you involved

04:53.293 --> 04:54.555
with my cousin's
Herbalife thing.

04:54.555 --> 04:55.904
Let me text him.
No. No.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.209
I'm just trying
to get petitions signed.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.602
Um, Janine tell
you about this?

04:58.602 --> 05:00.038
She might have
mentioned it.
Mm-hmm.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.214
I'll sign.

05:02.214 --> 05:05.566
So, heard you and Janine
just friends now.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.871
We are.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.046
Did she tell you
everything?

05:08.046 --> 05:09.918
That's what
friends do...

05:09.918 --> 05:11.485
Mr. It Was A Whoopsie.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.489
So, you cool being
just friends, or...

05:15.489 --> 05:16.707
Yes.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.143
I am, Erika.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.363
It's... fine.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.495
Are you done signing?

05:21.495 --> 05:23.584
Ooh, testy.

05:23.584 --> 05:24.976
I heard that pause, though.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.067
I'm-- I...Well, I barely
got anything.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.852
Me neither.
I mean, I get it.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.202
I wouldn't sign anything
I handed me.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.770
Janine, how'd you get that first
person to sign up so easily?

05:35.770 --> 05:37.337
Well, I just explained
to Krystal that if--

05:37.337 --> 05:38.860
Oh, the mom
with the "bitch" tattoo.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.252
Of course she signed on.

05:40.252 --> 05:42.124
She's one of our most
active parents.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.082
- Yeah.
- Oh, this was a fool's errand.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.910
Now it makes sense, 'cause
we were sent on it by a fool.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.912
Hey!
I'm sorry.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.261
I know you're trying
really hard,

05:49.261 --> 05:51.612
but... this may
be a lost cause.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.180
Hey! Don't go!

05:55.180 --> 05:57.487
This will only take
27 minutes of your time.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.925
So, how'd that
begging work out?

06:00.925 --> 06:02.013
Okay, we are
not begging.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.363
We are
respectfully pleading,

06:03.363 --> 06:04.581
and not well. Mm.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.800
- Where'd you go?
- Job interview.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.236
Ava!

06:07.236 --> 06:08.933
I'll be the first one fired
by Legendary.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.892
You know the saying--
"Finest one in, first one out."

06:10.892 --> 06:12.633
I thought you were trying
to stop us from going charter.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.112
I've been trying
to stop it.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.113
Even went down
to the school board myself,

06:15.113 --> 06:17.159
but now...

06:17.159 --> 06:19.161
Let's get every teacher
in a room, okay?

06:19.161 --> 06:21.206
And then we don't leave
until we figure this out.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.773
Or until 9:00 p.m.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.035
That's when my neighbors
start arguing,

06:24.035 --> 06:25.820
and you can't DVR that.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.648
What job did you
interview for, anyway?

06:27.648 --> 06:29.519
Chief Marketing Officer,
Legendary Schools.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.999
What?

06:30.999 --> 06:32.435
Their branding
needs work.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.354
I can't believe we might
all get fired.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.747
We don't know that yet.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.226
I have had just about enough, Morton.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.011
Sorry. That man knows
where my buttons are

06:43.011 --> 06:44.795
and just loves to push.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.145
We don't know anything.
This could be good.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.495
Or very bad.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.149
Thank you for that
crack analysis, Ally.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.150
Okay.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.456
My plan A didn't work out,

06:53.456 --> 06:55.371
so now I turn to you,
my plan B's.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.199
Well, I really don't know
where we go from here.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.375
We didn't get enough signatures,
and we need at least 500

06:59.375 --> 07:01.769
to prove to the school board
that the community's
against going charter.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.379
Hold up.
All we need is signatures?

07:03.379 --> 07:05.381
That's easy.
I know tons of names.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.992
Barbara, Melissa,
Jason, Marge,

07:07.992 --> 07:09.385
Homer, Peter Pan--

07:09.385 --> 07:11.996
They need to be real names
of real people

07:11.996 --> 07:13.607
who live in
- this community.
- Oh.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.609
What if we just focus
on new ideas?

07:15.609 --> 07:17.045
Because what we've been doing
isn't working.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.916
No idea is too stupid
to pitch.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.310
How about if we just lock
all the doors in the school?

07:21.310 --> 07:23.443
Then they can't get in.
Like "Lean on Me."

07:23.443 --> 07:26.054
In a rare turn of events,
I was wrong.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.751
Please only pitch
good ideas.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.711
Alright, what if we petition
to take over Addington?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.016
You know,
we go on the offense.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.323
Oh! I like it.
A hostile takeover.

07:34.323 --> 07:37.195
Did a lot of "hostel" takeovers
in Peru.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.197
Get it?
I stayed in them.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.721
Just trying
to lighten the mood.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.070
Normally, I would
politely chuckle,

07:42.070 --> 07:43.375
but this might not
be the right time

07:43.375 --> 07:44.725
- to lighten the mood.
- That's it, Morton.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.553
You want to get nuts?
Let's get nuts.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.816
Sorry. Sorry.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.208
We could bribe
the superintendent.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.645
With what money?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.473
Would you get your head
in the game, Ally?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.996
Mr. Johnson:
In my safety deposit box,

07:54.996 --> 07:57.389
I have 3/4 of what
I think is a treasure map.

07:57.389 --> 07:58.565
Now if we find
the other quarter...

08:01.393 --> 08:03.091
We have to trick them.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.919
We have to trick the community

08:04.919 --> 08:07.704
into simply signing their names
on our petition,

08:07.704 --> 08:11.229
and then we will submit it
to the school board, and...

08:11.229 --> 08:13.449
we will win.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.886
It's not my preference
to dance with the devil,

08:15.886 --> 08:17.758
but this is a special case.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.934
I'm sorry.
Tricking them just seems wrong.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.936
They need to know
what they're signing

08:21.936 --> 08:23.546
and the why behind it.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.462
No, let's trick 'em.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.508
Oh, guys, how would we
even do that?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.293
What, we throw a big festival
during Open House

08:31.293 --> 08:33.251
and make people sign
the petition to get in?

08:33.251 --> 08:36.080
Like... Now, that's absurd,
but it does give me an idea.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.735
We should throw a big <i>fun</i>
festival during the Open House

08:38.735 --> 08:40.650
and make everyone sign
the petition to get in.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.044
You just repeated what I said
and added the word "fun" in it.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.349
Yeah.
One problem.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.177
The parents don't come
to Open House.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.136
This'll be more than
an Open House.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.094
We have a couple weeks
to make this thing a blowout

08:50.094 --> 08:53.097
with games and prizes
and must-see entertainment.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.709
Why can't you ever give me
credit for a good idea?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.232
Stop making everything
about you, Janine.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.755
AVA Fest is about
the kids.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.148
Hold up. Ava Fest?

09:00.148 --> 09:01.758
Why is it named after you,
all of a sudden?

09:01.758 --> 09:03.978
It's not, Melissa.
A-V-A.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.632
A Very Abbott Festival.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.073
AVA Fest prep is popping off.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.204
Now, we don't have a lot
to work with,

09:13.204 --> 09:14.466
so we're leaning
on our strengths.

09:14.466 --> 09:15.990
Janine is trying
to locate her rhythm

09:15.990 --> 09:18.166
and help the step team
with their performance.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.297
 Oh, Ava, thank goodness
you're here.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.385
So, the girls
told me you said

09:20.385 --> 09:21.691
they could dance
to Ice Spice.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.388
I'm gonna say no,
but I have a catalog

09:23.388 --> 09:24.694
that I think
is pretty good.

09:24.694 --> 09:25.913
Mr. Johnson
found an old dunk tank

09:25.913 --> 09:27.349
in the basement.
Oh, come on.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.829
What, are you kidding me?
You said it yourself.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.787
The parents don't exactly
love you.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.615
They would be psyched
to come and dunk your ass.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.964
I don't know
how to swim.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.663
And now it's dangerous?
Even better.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.534
Barb is working on
a motivational speech.

09:38.534 --> 09:42.538
And to them I say,
"This is how you Abbott."

09:42.538 --> 09:45.019
I'm thinking about ending
with a song.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.108
And we welcome
your vocal acrobatics.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.805
This is gonna be
the best show in Philly

09:48.805 --> 09:51.373
since Dru Hill sold out
the Wachovia Center in '03.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.202
They were like two hours late,
but Sisqó did like 30 backflips.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.421
Mr. J is working
to keep the place spotless.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.466
What do you call this?

09:57.466 --> 09:58.641
Sharpening my mop.

09:58.641 --> 09:59.947
We're going to war.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.209
Sure, whatever.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.514
We got sharp mops,
dunk tanks,

10:02.514 --> 10:03.733
step, and food?

10:03.733 --> 10:04.865
What's the problem?

10:04.865 --> 10:06.388
They have
conflicting opinions

10:06.388 --> 10:07.694
on the consistency
of the macaroni.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.173
He would like soupy--Solid.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.566
And I believe
he would like solid.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.524
I would like to go back
to my classroom.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.874
This is AVA Fest, baby.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.658
We'll have soupy and solid.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.529
Double 'ronis.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.922
Congrats.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.320
Miss Teagues,
are you getting fired?

10:25.320 --> 10:28.845
What? No. N-No.
I don't... think so.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.194
I heard the school
is changing,

10:30.194 --> 10:31.935
and I think
I'm getting fired, too.

10:31.935 --> 10:35.809
Okay. No one is going anywhere,
at least not for now.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.245
So we're getting
fired later?

10:37.245 --> 10:39.726
Go back to your
art project.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.772
Oh, hey.
It is so busy.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.687
They are making projects
for AVA Fest and Open House.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.428
I'm worried this isn't gonna
be enough, though.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.386
Feels like we need more than
popsicle-stick houses

10:48.386 --> 10:49.387
to get people
to show up.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.867
Well, some are castles.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.477
I'm thinking more
of a headliner.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.610
It's like going to see Paramore
without Hayley Williams.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.003
There are other people
in that band?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.569
- Yeah, actually.
- Hmm.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.919
Maybe I can call Tariq.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.398
What? Why?

11:00.398 --> 11:02.009
Well, because he's from
the neighborhood,

11:02.009 --> 11:03.750
and--
and people like him.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.274
And he's on the WNBA pre-game
pump-up playlist on Spotify.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.928
He could draw
a crowd.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.408
Um, I don't-- I don't--
I don't think so.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.280
Um, he's a bit
of a wild card.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
But I do think we're
on the right track.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.152
We're gonna
figure this out.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.893
Okay.
Yeah.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.549
Hey!
You better watch that.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.985
Anytime the score
gets past 20,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.639
that thing
starts to shake. Please.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.206
That scoreboard's been here
since you had

11:25.206 --> 11:27.469
a full head of hair
and a look of hope on your face.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.950
So, this is all great, Ava,
but, you know, Gregory and I

11:29.950 --> 11:32.604
were thinking that we needed
something, you know, flashy.

11:32.604 --> 11:33.954
Like something big,
a big name.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.303
Something for the parents.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.479
Ooh, ooh.
What about Nikki Giovanni?

11:37.479 --> 11:39.307
Oh, my God.
Do you know her?

11:39.307 --> 11:40.961
No.
You know what?

11:40.961 --> 11:42.484
I've already
handled this.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.920
Walk with me.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.316
Boom!

11:48.316 --> 11:50.622
You got Jazmine Sullivan
to come here tomorrow night?

11:50.622 --> 11:52.494
That's amazing, Ava.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.625
We're gonna pull this off.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.149
Yes.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.455
Who is Jazmine Sulliv--

12:00.545 --> 12:01.633
Things are looking up.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.287
But nothing more dangerous

12:03.287 --> 12:05.028
than an uninformed signatory.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.596
So I have a plan in place
to make sure the community

12:07.596 --> 12:09.685
understands the situation
at hand.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.905
Now turn around.
I gotta wand you, son.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.560
Is that
a curling iron?

12:15.560 --> 12:16.953
Can't be too careful.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.172
Hey,
where the party at?

12:18.172 --> 12:19.347
Oh, my God.
It's right here.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.349
Wow, isn't this fun?

12:21.349 --> 12:22.611
Um, I'm sure you guys
are members

12:22.611 --> 12:24.352
of the community
like I am,

12:24.352 --> 12:26.006
and I heard there's
an informational sesh

12:26.006 --> 12:28.182
taking place about
the issues facing Abbott.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.270
Yo, don't you work here?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.967
She does.
Alright, okay.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.403
Guilty.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.492
Serving a life sentence
as an educator.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.190
But I just want you to know
the petition you're signing

12:36.190 --> 12:37.495
means we can keep
Abbott, Abbott.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.193
Information is power.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.673
Listen, lady, I'm just trying
to dunk a white dude.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.024
Next!

12:44.024 --> 12:45.373
♪ Two bad brauds ♪

12:45.373 --> 12:47.549
♪ Lookin' like they down right ♪

12:47.549 --> 12:49.551
♪ Ah, baby, tell me
is you down right? ♪

12:49.551 --> 12:51.205
Alright, step right up.
Step right up.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.381
You're not really a fan of him,

12:53.381 --> 12:55.339
and now's your chance
to send him plunging

12:55.339 --> 12:58.038
into whatever
our tap water's made of.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.953
Let's go. Come on.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.389
Oh, I knew it, Morton.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.826
I knew you hated me.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.871
Oh, uh...

13:04.871 --> 13:06.437
Sorry.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.396
Hey, Gregory.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.702
Hey, Amber.
Um, how are you?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.835
Good. Cute.
You?

13:12.835 --> 13:15.664
I'm good. I see you finally
got your bag.

13:15.664 --> 13:16.970
Thank you.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.580
My boyfriend
got it for me.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.669
Your boyfriend?
We broke up like two weeks ago.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.714
And? I met Rashon
a week after.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.412
Gregory, look.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.022
It's a wrap
between us,

13:26.022 --> 13:28.068
but you'll find somebody
more your speed.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.374
Let's just focus
on the festival.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.550
Um... Dad: You know I don't like
hanging around.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.552
When is Jazmine Sullivan
getting here?

13:34.552 --> 13:35.989
I bet I won't.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.339
Look, I'm giving it
about 10 more minutes.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.601
I need to get on home.

13:39.601 --> 13:40.994
Hey.
How we doing?

13:40.994 --> 13:42.778
Still quite a few
signatures short.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.041
Man, well, people
are starting to, like,

13:45.041 --> 13:46.695
call their friends and tell them
not to come, you know?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.262
Where's our headliner?

13:48.262 --> 13:50.046
You know, that's a really
good question.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.353
Right?

13:52.353 --> 13:55.008
Um, Ava?

13:55.008 --> 13:56.966
When is Jazmine Sullivan
getting here?

13:56.966 --> 13:59.273
Good one, Gregory.
Like she'd ever come here.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.797
What? But you said
she was coming.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.321
Yeah, but before I said that,
Barb said to trick 'em.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.932
So she's not coming?

14:05.932 --> 14:08.195
You need to pay better
attention, Janine.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.588
Buckets!

14:16.029 --> 14:16.986
- Ava, why did you lie?
- I thought that was
the whole point.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.335
You lie to them,
not to us.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.946
- My lies don't discriminate.
- Oh, my God.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.251
Look, either way, we still
don't have enough signatures.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.210
Well, look,
maybe they won't realize it.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.864
Hey, yo, Jazmine Sullivan ain't
even coming, y'all.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.996
Yeah, they done tricked us
into supporting the school

14:26.996 --> 14:29.477
by dangling the carrot
of a local yet global

14:29.477 --> 14:31.958
R songstress
in our face!

14:31.958 --> 14:34.003
Well, they put that together
quite quickly.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.136
Okay, I had a feeling
that Ava may pull an Ava,

14:36.136 --> 14:37.659
so I called in
a backup plan, but...

14:37.659 --> 14:39.574
Ah.
Well, well, well.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.619
If it isn't the little people
who first believed in me,

14:41.619 --> 14:43.578
and then I left behind
for FADE and fortune.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.146
- Tariq, you're here?
- Yeah, what's up, 'Neen?

14:46.146 --> 14:48.017
Don't try to win me back
with some type of grand gesture.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.976
I am very busy right now, actually.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.194
Get on the stage.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.065
You're right,
Talent Manager.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.023
- Alright.
- Give me that.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.069
You called Tariq?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.461
Anything for Abbott, right?

14:57.461 --> 14:58.810
Aw, yeah.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.161
Time to slay one
for my day ones.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.033
What's up, y'all?
Yeah!

15:04.033 --> 15:06.122
Legendary Schools,
they said that my jingle

15:06.122 --> 15:08.255
infringed upon
a "existing melody."

15:08.255 --> 15:09.430
Like...

15:09.430 --> 15:10.692
And then FADE,
they fired me

15:10.692 --> 15:12.824
because I had become
a liability.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.784
So, yeah, between
Legendary Schools, FADE,

15:15.784 --> 15:17.612
that one dude
at Lady Foot Locker,

15:17.612 --> 15:20.658
I got enough beefs to start
a butcher shop right now.

15:20.658 --> 15:21.746
Let me see y'all
put a fist up.

15:21.746 --> 15:22.747
Yeah.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.184
Put that fist up real quick.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.620
This a powerful symbol.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.318
This-- This
the universal symbol for...

15:28.318 --> 15:30.538
Hey, we--
we will fight y'all.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.627
Yeah, you feel me?

16:07.662 --> 16:08.968
They got a rapper now.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.143
You should pull up.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.666
Never have I ever

16:11.666 --> 16:14.364
been so happy to hear
such explicit content.

16:14.364 --> 16:15.539
Yep.
Mm.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.541
So happy
I thought of this.

16:17.541 --> 16:20.153
Oh, no.
Is that...

16:20.153 --> 16:21.893
Draemond.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.113
What is he doing here?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.507
Did y'all get a youth pastor
to do stand-up during my set?

16:26.507 --> 16:28.117
What's going on?

16:28.117 --> 16:29.640
Good evening, everyone.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.729
I'm Draemond Winding
from Legendary Schools,

16:31.729 --> 16:33.775
and I'm sorry to say
you're being lied to.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.559
The petition that's
circulating this evening

16:35.559 --> 16:37.735
is nothing more than a promise
to hold your children back.

16:37.735 --> 16:40.042
These teachers
are afraid of change.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.523
They want to keep this place
tore up from the floor up.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.438
Okay, just give me
the signal.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.787
But I want to turn it
into a beautiful,

16:45.787 --> 16:47.745
new Legendary property.

16:47.745 --> 16:48.964
Yo, I just walked around
this school.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.574
This place looks
alright to me.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.881
But we can do better.
We <i>will</i> do better.

16:52.881 --> 16:56.406
I heard those Legendary Schools
do look fresh and new.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.235
And we can bring that here.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.758
The truth is
Abbott is failing.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.108
Parent #2: I haven't
been here all year,

17:02.108 --> 17:03.500
but they're making
race cars,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.763
doing goofy murals
and fun stuff here.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.591
They do the best
with what they have.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.550
I went to Abbott.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.595
The great Mrs. Howard
was my teacher,

17:11.595 --> 17:13.249
and she gave me so much.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.816
Then I struggled

17:14.816 --> 17:17.558
until I found my way
into a charter school.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.343
Folks, you talk to any parent
from Addington--

17:20.343 --> 17:22.693
My kid went to Addington,
and you kicked him out.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.479
No, we don't--
we don't kick kids out.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.959
We encourage a small few

17:27.959 --> 17:31.006
to explore other
educational opportunities.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.095
Yeah, by kicking
them out.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.966
I want to focus
on the future.

17:34.966 --> 17:39.667
This place is going to get
a full and complete facelift.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.887
We are going to hire the best
and brightest teachers.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.412
What about the teachers
we have here now?

17:45.412 --> 17:47.240
What you gonna do?
You gonna fire Mrs. Howard?

17:47.240 --> 17:48.937
- Huh?
- No, not Mrs. Howard. No.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.243
Oh, yeah?
Then who?

17:50.243 --> 17:51.679
If your child
becomes a student

17:51.679 --> 17:53.333
at Legendary Charter,
you will s--

17:53.333 --> 17:54.725
If? Wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.032
My kid might not
even get to go here?

17:57.032 --> 18:00.818
We employ a lottery system
to ensure equality.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.124
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.691
I play the lottery
every single day,

18:03.691 --> 18:05.258
and I never win.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.738
This man is playing
the Powerball with our kids!

18:09.523 --> 18:12.178
The reality is

18:12.178 --> 18:15.050
Legendary has resources
Abbott just does not.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.660
Then why don't you spend
that money on Abbott?

18:16.660 --> 18:19.576
Help us make this school better,
since you care so much.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.537
See, I told you
our community would step up.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.278
I guess they know more about
this stuff than we thought.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.802
Yeah, no. What they know
is a phony when they see one.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.586
- Yeah.
- Folks, listen.
What-- What I--

18:29.586 --> 18:31.153
Man, get out of here
with that nut-ass suit.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.896
Yeah.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.507
Go on somewhere.

18:37.507 --> 18:38.900
Yeah, yeah.
Get them all.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.249
Get 'em out of here.
Bye!

18:40.249 --> 18:41.642
Get 'em out of here.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.166
Yeah.
Get 'em out of here.

we can just

19:21.464 --> 19:23.379
put this whole endeavor
behind us.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.600
This actually takes a lot
off my plate.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.864
I really brought the community
together tonight, huh?

19:29.864 --> 19:32.258
Bless your soul, Draemond.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.781
Every student is special,

19:33.781 --> 19:35.435
and you have to give them
your best.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.872
And you hope that they will
carry it with them,

19:37.872 --> 19:39.613
but at the end of the day,

19:39.613 --> 19:42.398
<i>they</i> have to decide
who they want to be.

19:42.398 --> 19:47.490
And this one decided
to be a jackass.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.405
Alright, I think we have
cleaned up enough for tonight.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.624
We can do
the rest tomorrow.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.191
It is so magical

19:52.191 --> 19:54.193
when everyone comes together
for a cause.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.543
See? This is what I love
about emergencies.

19:56.543 --> 19:57.587
You know what?
Now that we've got

19:57.587 --> 19:58.893
the community
all fired up,

19:58.893 --> 20:00.242
we should ask them
for more stuff,

20:00.242 --> 20:02.636
like calculators
and another dunk tank.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.507
You know, Tariq really
bailed us out.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.293
Yes, and you called him.
You saved Abbott.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.686
Well, we all did.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.514
And the best part
is Mr. Morton and I

20:11.514 --> 20:14.125
- are practically BFFs now.
- Ooh.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.084
No, he still hates you.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.086
Impossible.
What did he say?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.262
He said, "I still hate Jacob.
Pass the chips."

20:20.262 --> 20:21.872
Wait a minute.
There were chips?

20:21.872 --> 20:24.527
Why was I eating wet-yet-dry
macaroni all night?

20:24.527 --> 20:27.138
I am so happy Abbott is safe.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.401
This is the best--

20:28.401 --> 20:30.098
Oh, geez.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.143
Ooh, what in the immaculate
reception?

20:32.143 --> 20:33.580
Oh.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.495
Melissa Oh. Scoreboard.
Always something.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.192
Well, Abbott's
gonna Abbott.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.889
You know what?
Let's go home.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.761
We can hit the ground running
on this Monday.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.110
Hell, yeah.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.765
Guys...

20:44.765 --> 20:46.506
I think
I can pick this up, right?

20:46.506 --> 20:48.986
Janine, don't try
and fix that!

20:54.514 --> 20:56.167
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.995
I'm tryin' to find a new lane
since this FADE beef.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.432
I'm looking at a lot of avenues
untouched by mainstream rappers.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.650
I got a whole gang
of national park songs,

21:00.650 --> 21:01.999
mainly about how mountaintops

21:01.999 --> 21:03.262
look like boobies.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.915
I got a anti-Amazon song.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.569
I got a pro-Amazon song called

21:06.569 --> 21:08.092
"She Gon' Get This Package."

21:08.092 --> 21:10.007
I got a song about, uh,
endangered species,

21:10.007 --> 21:12.445
'cause I'm trying to help them
bring velociraptors back.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.185
You know, when they get
the mosquitos in that amber.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.274
You know how they do.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.537
Um, hey, any of y'all got a car?

21:17.537 --> 21:19.887
'Cause I need a ride back
to New York and then--

21:19.887 --> 21:22.890
and then back here to Philly
with all my stuff in it.
