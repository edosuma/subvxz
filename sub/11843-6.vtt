00:10.276 --> 00:12.711
<i>Thank you, Sheriff
Your work is done. We?! take it from here.</i>

00:12.779 --> 00:16.773
<i>Oh, the sheriff is Kyle's dad.
He's gonna find out the truth.</i>

00:16.850 --> 00:19.820
Kyle, I really don't think that
we should be together anymore.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.752
What do you make
of that mark?

00:21.821 --> 00:24.688
<i>So with this picture,
what we're saying is there's more of us?</i>

00:24.758 --> 00:26.590
One more.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.881
What do you want,
you two-bit punk?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.180
Nothing. This is all just a mistake.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.051
Huh?

02:36.522 --> 02:38.923
It was all just
one big mistake.

Listening to Mr. Sommers...

03:59.939 --> 04:02.772
<i>I realized how strange it must be
for Max, Isabel, and Michael.».</i>

04:02.842 --> 04:05.243
<i>not to even know
their own history.</i>

04:05.311 --> 04:08.372
And how scary it would be if anyone
discovered it before they did.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.179
For tonight's assignment,
I've paired you together.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.275
<i>It is your job as...</i>

04:13.353 --> 04:15.845
historians...

04:15.922 --> 04:20.291
to find out as much as you can about your
partner by asking these specific questions...

04:20.360 --> 04:23.386
and then writing up an oral
history report for tomorrow.

04:23.463 --> 04:27.627
Uh, excuse me, but these are kinda personal,
don't you think?

04:27.700 --> 04:31.796
Exactly. Personal is the goal
of the professional biographer.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.397
And who knows?
You just might make a new friend.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.442
Okay, so the partners
are as follows-

04:36.509 --> 04:39.410
<i>Daska! with Hausman.</i>

04:39.479 --> 04:43.780
Kalinowski with Unell.
Parker with Evans.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.784
<i>That's l. Evans.</i>

04:45.852 --> 04:48.947
<i>M. Evans is with...</i>

04:49.021 --> 04:51.615

04:51.691 --> 04:56.253
Papas with Cooney.
DeLuca with... Guerin.

04:56.329 --> 04:59.094
- Wait, <i>did you just say Guerin?</i>
- <i>Yes, Michael Guerin.</i>

04:59.165 --> 05:01.156
No, no, I'm sorry.
That's unacceptable.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.336
- I beg your pardon?
- I mean, the guy's not even here.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.831
Well, then it'll be
like true fieldwork...

05:09.909 --> 05:12.139
tracking down
your subject.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.305
<i>Trusse/I with Wolf.</i>

05:14.380 --> 05:16.747
I mean, this is like
cruel and unusual education.

05:16.816 --> 05:21.515
I mean, aren't there, like, Geneva convention
rules against this sort of thing?

05:21.587 --> 05:24.420
Could this possibly
get any worse?

05:24.490 --> 05:27.187
All right, so let's meet
at the Crashdown after school today...

05:27.260 --> 05:29.991
get started on some
of these questions.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.860
Get to know
each other a little.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.301

acting so weird since we broke up.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.621
Mm. My pleasure, Steve.

06:00.693 --> 06:04.926
As you know, I did my graduate thesis on
the importance of oral history in psychology.

06:04.997 --> 06:07.523
So, did you pair up the students
the way I suggested?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.661
Oh, yes, yes.
It should prove quite interesting.

06:10.736 --> 06:13.171
Sometimes you end up with
the most revealing details...

06:13.239 --> 06:15.367
just by putting
the right people together.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.938

You okay?
I mean, you look-

06:27.653 --> 06:31.487
Shaken. Yes.
Shaken by the entire incident.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.821

06:33.893 --> 06:35.554
<i>[ Black wood]

the premises at your behest.

06:38.764 --> 06:42.496
<i>Please! He's a hoodlum.
Max doesn't know people like that.</i>

06:42.568 --> 06:46.061
- Well, actually-
- Evans-

06:46.138 --> 06:48.835
Say it isn't so.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.640
I lent him my keys so he could pick up
some research we needed for class.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.908
I lost them. The keys.
So I snuck in.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.678
- I'm shocked.
- He wasn't trying to steal anything.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.014
I was trying
to do him a favor.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.411
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't press charges.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.514
If there were
any damages...

07:05.591 --> 07:08.617
I'd be happy
to work them off.

07:08.694 --> 07:11.425
Well, uh-

07:11.497 --> 07:14.592
I suppose we could
work something out.

07:14.667 --> 07:18.126
<i>Ifnobodys gonna press any charges,
you're free to go.</i>

07:18.204 --> 07:20.138

- Thanks.
- Yeah.

07:37.356 --> 07:40.951
Don't do me

08:18.230 --> 08:20.631
- I'm going there.
- Have you completely lost it?

08:20.700 --> 08:24.534
No, I've found it. And you guys
are too scared to admit it.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.505
Gimme the keys to thejeep.
I want to go to Marathon.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.168
Let's just wait until we can find out
more about this place.

08:32.244 --> 08:34.178
Max, I'm connected
to this thing, all right?

08:34.246 --> 08:37.807
I see it when I close my eyes.
I dream about it when I go to sleep.

08:37.883 --> 08:41.513
And it's not letting me wait,
no matter what you guys say.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.519

You're telling me to get out?
This is my car.

Being alone
in a car with you.

12:36.455 --> 12:40.289
- In a car alone with who?
- Not knowing where we're going...

12:40.359 --> 12:42.555

12:42.628 --> 12:45.097
- Do you always talk this much?
- Was that Michael?

12:45.164 --> 12:47.258

when I'm nervous.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.563
Very nervous.

12:49.635 --> 12:52.730
You're nervous about being
in a car alone with Michael?

12:52.805 --> 12:55.866
So, how far
will we be going...

12:55.941 --> 12:58.433
south on 285, huh?

12:58.510 --> 13:00.842
- South on 285?

What's going on?

13:14.260 --> 13:16.388
That was Maria.
She's with Michael in a car.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.396
I don't know.
She sounded really weird.

We have to go.

He found a car.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.742

13:35.814 --> 13:37.748
The less you know
right now, the better.

13:37.816 --> 13:43.186
- Max, no. Not when Maria's involved.
- Maria?

13:43.255 --> 13:47.158
It would be her car with her in it.
Going south on 285.

13:47.226 --> 13:50.685
We better hurry. Wait.
No, you can't come.

13:52.197 --> 13:55.656

So soon?

13:59.371 --> 14:02.636
Get in.

14:16.888 --> 14:18.822
I'm outside

just left... in a hurry.

14:21.526 --> 14:24.962
- Let's find out where they're going.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.757
Well, yeah,
it's a really big test.

14:54.826 --> 14:57.591
So, look, if I spend the night at Maria's...

14:57.662 --> 14:59.756
then I can get
maximum study time in.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.856
Okay.

15:01.933 --> 15:04.732
And, Mom, if you need me,
just call me on the cell, okay?

Yeah, well, at least
she knows what species I am.

15:13.144 --> 15:15.272
Let's just find them
and bring them back home.

15:15.346 --> 15:17.906
What are you guys
not telling me about this?

15:17.982 --> 15:21.782
<i>Michael is the kind of guy that could
be involved in some pretty shadystufi'.</i>

15:23.288 --> 15:25.882
You guys know exactly
where they're going, don't you?

15:25.957 --> 15:28.585
Marathon, Texas?
That's, like, in another state.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.594
It's only
three more hours.

15:30.662 --> 15:33.461
- You- You are going to be arrested.
- For driving t0 <i>Texas?</i>

15:33.531 --> 15:36.228
Across a state line with a minor.
In a stolen vehicle.

15:36.301 --> 15:39.430
There are laws, you know.
And that-that cell phone you just tossed-

15:39.504 --> 15:41.438
vandalism
of personal property.

15:41.506 --> 15:44.032
God, I just- I knew you
had criminal tendencies.

15:44.108 --> 15:46.042
You even
drive erratically.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.078
What's exactly wrong
with my driving?

15:48.146 --> 15:50.638
I told you not to go over 80.
The engine won't take it.

31:39.494 --> 31:42.828
I'm sorry too, Max.
You know, for Kyle and...

31:42.897 --> 31:46.356
how my stupid, boring life could possibly
get you guys into trouble.

31:49.837 --> 31:52.534
First of all,
nothing about you is stupid.

31:54.275 --> 31:56.437
And secondly...

31:58.379 --> 32:00.313
it feels like...

32:00.381 --> 32:04.215
my life didn't even start
