WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:02.698
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.741 --> 00:04.221
DELILAH: SANCTUM WAS COLONIZED

00:04.265 --> 00:07.398
BY A TEAM FROM EARTH MADE UP
OF 4 FAMILIES--THE PRIMES.

00:07.442 --> 00:10.184
GABRIEL: NOT EVERYONE BELIEVES
IN THE DIVINITY OF THE PRIMES.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.185
RUSSELL: CHILDREN OF GABRIEL.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.622
NONBELIEVERS MUST BE PURIFIED!

00:13.665 --> 00:16.059
WOMAN: DIE, NONBELIEVERS!
UHH!

00:16.103 --> 00:18.540
CLARKE: NO!

00:18.583 --> 00:19.976
RUSSELL: IT WILL BE
YOUR GREAT HONOR

00:20.020 --> 00:21.804
TO BECOME ONE
WITH SIMONE PRIME.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.371
CLARKE: I TRIED TO DO BETTER.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.025
AND THEN I LOST MY MOM.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.896
RAVEN: THE FLAME.
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.332
I'M NOT THE
COMMANDER ANYMORE.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.117
INDRA: RAVEN, SHEIDHEDA.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.727
NIYLAH: WHERE DID HE GO?

00:31.770 --> 00:33.424
GABRIEL: NO ONE HAS EVER
COME OUT OF THE ANOMALY.

00:33.468 --> 00:37.211
OCTAVIA: HOPE.
HOPE: I'M SO SORRY, OCTAVIA.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.473
ECHO: KNIFE!
BELLAMY: NO!

00:38.516 --> 00:39.561
HOPE: UHH!

00:42.216 --> 00:43.826
OCTAVIA!

00:46.220 --> 00:47.743
OCTAVIA!

00:49.571 --> 00:52.095
OCTAVIA!

01:04.890 --> 01:06.240
BELLAMY?

01:07.937 --> 01:08.981
BELLAMY!

01:12.028 --> 01:13.073
AAH!

01:28.479 --> 01:30.264
UHH!

01:30.307 --> 01:31.352
UHH!

01:33.919 --> 01:35.660
-WHOA, WHOA, EASY.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.445
HOPE: WHERE AM I?

01:37.488 --> 01:39.447
YOU'RE OK.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.145
UH, BELLAMY
SHE'S AWAKE.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.538
WHO ARE YOU?

01:43.581 --> 01:44.669
I WAS ABOUT TO
ASK YOU THE SAME.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.280
OCTAVIA CALLED YOU HOPE.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.411
THE NAME DIYOZA CHOSE

01:47.455 --> 01:48.586
FOR HER UNBORN CHILD.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.548
DIYOZA? OCTAVIA?

01:53.591 --> 01:56.333
YOU'RE, UH...
YOU'RE HURT.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.119
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
LET ME SEE. OOH!

02:01.904 --> 02:03.427
HOPE, WAIT!

02:05.908 --> 02:07.779
BELLAMY! ECHO!

02:10.869 --> 02:12.175
ECHO: WE'RE NOT ALONE.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.394
BACK INSIDE.
WATCH THE GIRL.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.743
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.874
COME ON.
WE CAN STILL
CATCH HER.

02:17.702 --> 02:18.747
UHH!

02:20.357 --> 02:21.706
SOMETHING ELSE
CAME THROUGH.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.100
WELCOME TO THE PARTY.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.319
WHERE'S BELLAMY?

02:25.362 --> 02:26.711
IT TOOK HIM
TOWARDS THE ANOMALY.

02:26.755 --> 02:29.105
NO, NO, NO, NO.
TIME'S NOT BEHAVING.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.933
WE HAVE TO GET
TO HIM FIRST.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.761
ECHO, YOU CAN'T SHOOT
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.155
STOP TALKING. I'M OPENING
UP A PATH. FOLLOW ME!

03:23.290 --> 03:24.334
MADI: HELLO.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.772
YOU SAID I COULD
START SCHOOL TODAY.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.339
WHY ARE WE HERE?

03:29.383 --> 03:31.820
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
LIKE TO SEE OUR NEW HOME.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.430
RUSSELL BUILT IT
FOR SIMONE

03:33.474 --> 03:34.953
SO SHE'D HAVE A PLACE
THAT REMINDED HER

03:34.997 --> 03:36.520
OF THE FARM
SHE GREW UP ON,

03:36.564 --> 03:38.696
BACK ON EARTH,
BEFORE THE BOMBS.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.526
PICASSO COMES WITH IT.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.875
WE CAN KEEP HER?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.057
THANK YOU, CLARKE.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.277
CLARKE: LET'S GO INSIDE.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.583
MADI: COME ON, GIRL.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.849
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I LIKE LESS--

04:00.892 --> 04:02.590
LYING ABOUT THE FLAME
OR MAKING MADI

04:02.633 --> 04:05.245
PRETEND SHE'S
STILL COMMANDER.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.030
INDRA THINKS IT
COULD SPLIT WONKRU.
YOU DON'T AGREE?

04:08.073 --> 04:10.554
I DO, AND I KNOW
WE NEED THEM

04:10.598 --> 04:11.947
UNIFIED TO KEEP
THE PEACE HERE.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.602
JUST...I WORRY
ABOUT MADI.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.736
YEAH.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.521
FOR NOW,
WE KEEP IT QUIET.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.219
INDRA CAN SAY THAT
SHE SPEAKS FOR HEDA.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
BUT MADI IS
OUT OF IT.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.744
SHE FINALLY GETS
TO BE A KID.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.444
COME ON.
THERE ARE

04:30.487 --> 04:32.141
PLENTY OF ROOMS
FOR ALL OF US.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.666
INDRA: HEDA. IF YOU DON'T MIND,

04:35.710 --> 04:37.494
YOU'RE NEEDED ELSEWHERE.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.714
CLARKE: WHERE?
INDRA: WE'VE BEEN HERE A DAY,

04:39.757 --> 04:41.063
AND WONKRU
HASN'T SEEN HER.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.412
GAIA: MOTHER,
DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.546
GO ON, MADI.
EAT YOUR LUNCH.
IT'S OK.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.161
COME ON, GIRL.
LET'S GO.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.599
MAN: HEY, MADI.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.079
SHE SEEMS OK.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.559
INDRA: SHE IS.
GAIA: SHE WILL BE.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.171
GAIA: THERE'S NEVER BEEN
AN EX-COMMANDER BEFORE.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.129
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
HAVING THE FLAME REMOVED

05:04.173 --> 05:06.088
WILL AFFECT HER.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.524
NOT TO MENTION
BEING TAKEN OVER BY--

05:07.568 --> 05:08.743
SHEIDHEDA'S GONE.

05:08.786 --> 05:09.961
ARE WE SURE ABOUT THAT?

05:13.878 --> 05:17.099
HE'S GONE.
I DIDN'T MEAN--I--

05:17.142 --> 05:18.579
I WOULD JUST
FEEL BETTER IF I KNEW

05:18.622 --> 05:20.885
WHERE THAT CODE ENDED UP,
THAT'S ALL.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.234
CLARKE: OK.
THEN ON YOUR NEXT

05:22.278 --> 05:23.671
SUPPLY RUN
TO THE MOTHERSHIP,

05:23.714 --> 05:25.412
YOU CAN SEARCH
THE COMPUTER AGAIN.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.415
MEANTIME, WE HAVE
TO ESTABLISH A ROUTINE.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.591
NOT JUST FOR MADI
BUT FOR ALL OF US.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.332
SANCTUM IS BROKEN,
AND IT'S OUR JOB

05:32.375 --> 05:33.724
TO PUT IT
BACK TOGETHER.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.510
IF WE FOCUS ON THAT,
WE'LL BE OK.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.990
NOW LET'S EAT SO WE
CAN GET BACK TO WORK.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.345
ONE OF US NEEDS TO
REPRESENT THE COMMANDER.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.043
AND I'M HUNGRY.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.101
MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS.

06:06.714 --> 06:07.802
I'M SORRY.

06:07.845 --> 06:14.112
IT'S OK, RAVEN.
I'M FINE.

06:19.030 --> 06:23.426
MAN: ♪ I GOT DARKNESS
ON MY MIND ♪

06:23.470 --> 06:28.170
♪ SO THE QUESTION MARK,
IT KEEPS ME LOOKING... ♪

06:28.213 --> 06:30.694
HER MOTOR FUNCTIONS
SEEM NORMAL.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.088
CLARKE: MADI, COME ON.
LET'S EAT.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.437
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
YOUR NEW ROOM.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
OK.
COME ON, PICASSO.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.311
MURPHY: I SEE YOU TOOK
THE MASTER SUITE.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.792
NIYLAH: TO THE VICTOR
GO THE SPOILS.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.316
WE ALL SHARE
THE CLOTHES, THOUGH.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.970
EMORI: IT'S FINE, CLARKE.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.842
OUR ROOM IS FINE.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.626
A LITTLE TIGHT, BUT
WE'LL MAKE IT WORK.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.846
MAYBE DANIEL
AND KAYLEE PRIME

06:51.889 --> 06:53.456
SHOULD LIVE
IN THE PALACE.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.851
DANIEL AND KAYLEE PRIME
SAVED YOUR ASS, MILLER.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.461
BUT A THANK YOU
WOULD DO.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.158
EMORI: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
THAT PALACE IS--

07:00.202 --> 07:02.247
INDRA: NO ONE LIVES
IN THE PALACE,

07:02.291 --> 07:03.510
LEAST OF ALL US.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.946
BEING SEEN AS CONQUERORS

07:04.989 --> 07:07.078
WILL ONLY MAKE
KEEPING THE PEACE HARDER.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.999
AHH. AHEM.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.003
OUR FIRST MEAL IN OUR NEW HOME.

07:20.570 --> 07:21.615
TO ABSENT FRIENDS.

07:23.486 --> 07:24.835
AND DEPARTED ONES.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.839
MILLER: TO ABBY.
ALL: TO ABBY.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.366
HEY!

07:34.410 --> 07:35.803
WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

07:39.328 --> 07:40.677
I'M SORRY,

07:40.721 --> 07:42.462
BUT I'M NOT JUST GONNA SIT HERE

07:42.505 --> 07:44.028
WHILE HE DRINKS TO THE WOMAN
THAT HE GOT KILLED.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.599
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
RUSSELL WAS GONNA DO.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.736
OK, I--CLARKE,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

07:55.779 --> 07:56.998
I BELIEVE YOU.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.394
DWELLING ON THE PAST

08:02.438 --> 08:04.135
IS NOT GOING TO GET
THIS COMPOUND RUNNING.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.182
AND IT WON'T GET
OUR COMPOUND BUILT.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.729
AHH. WHAT THE--

08:39.606 --> 08:40.781
UHH.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.110
INDRA: THE PEOPLE OF SANCTUM
HAVE LOST THEIR WAY OF LIFE,

09:06.154 --> 09:08.112
BUT MANY STILL BELIEVE
IN THE PRIMES.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.461
THEY BLAME US.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.985
FAITH IS
A POWERFUL THING.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.595
A DANGEROUS THING.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.031
WE CAN EXPECT
CONFLICT BETWEEN

09:14.075 --> 09:16.164
BELIEVERS
AND NONBELIEVERS.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.122
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
THE CHILDREN OF
GABRIEL ARE HERE.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.646
SANCTUM IS THEIR HOME, TOO.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.169
THEY WANT RUSSELL PRIME

09:21.212 --> 09:23.171
AND ANYONE WHO
BELIEVES IN HIM DEAD.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.608
AT THE MOMENT, THEY, TOO,
ARE OUR ALLIES.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.742
ADD TO THAT 36 HARDENED
CRIMINALS FROM EARTH

09:28.785 --> 09:31.353
WHO WONKRU WAS AT WAR WITH
A FEW DAYS AGO,

09:31.396 --> 09:32.963
AND I SAY WE HAVE OUR HANDS FULL

09:33.007 --> 09:34.312
BEING THE KEEPERS OF THE PEACE.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.794
AT THE POINT
OF A GUN?

09:37.838 --> 09:39.927
UNTIL WE'RE SURE
ALL THE GUNS
ARE ROUNDED UP,

09:39.970 --> 09:41.798
WONKRU WILL BE ARMED.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.844
MURPHY: AN ARMY
OF CANNIBAL
PEACEKEEPERS, HUH?

09:45.236 --> 09:46.586
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

09:46.629 --> 09:47.761
REMIND ME AGAIN
HOW LONG WE GOTTA WAIT

09:47.804 --> 09:49.545
UNTIL OUR COMPOUND
GETS BUILT.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.113
TWO YEARS
IF EVERYTHING
GOES PERFECTLY.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.723
MAN: HEY! GET AWAY FROM THERE!

09:53.767 --> 09:54.985
SO 3 YEARS.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.647
INDRA: ALL RIGHT.
STOP STARING.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.996
IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.132
HEDA.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.093
GO LEARN
SOMETHING, OK?

10:20.532 --> 10:21.795
BODYGUARDS?

10:21.838 --> 10:24.449
YEAH. BUT
NOT SO CLOSE

10:24.493 --> 10:26.538
AND MAKE SURE
THEY LEAVE HER ALONE.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.670
COPY THAT.

10:32.719 --> 10:33.981
TOO MANY PEOPLE.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.896
RAVEN: GOOD THING
ALIE'S NOT AROUND.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.593
THERE YOU ARE.
THANK GOD.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.203
JAMES, WHAT IS IT?
THE REACTOR AGAIN?

10:39.247 --> 10:40.640
NO. THIS IS MORE
EXPLOSIVE THAN THAT.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.731
NIKKI: WHAT'S THE MATTER?
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.384
I'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO SAY THAT AGAIN.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.517
TREY: WAIT.
DON'T HURT HIM. PLEASE.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.040
JORDAN: TREY, IT'S OK.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.347
I JUST MEANT THIS PALACE
IS SACRED TO THEM.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.045
I'M SURE WE CAN FIND YOU
SOMEPLACE ELSE--

10:55.089 --> 10:57.047
DON'T MIND
MY WIFE.

10:57.091 --> 11:00.224
SHE'S MORE
BARK THAN BITE. HMM.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.881
NELSON: THIS LOOKS LIKE FUN.
CRIMINALS AND FOOLS.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.317
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.623
HATCH: THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.494
ME AND MY FRIENDS
HERE, WE'RE JUST

11:09.538 --> 11:11.409
LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO LAY OUR HEADS.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.237
YOU CAN'T DO IT HERE.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.848
THIS UNHOLY SHRINE

11:14.891 --> 11:16.806
IS NOW CONTROLLED BY
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.721
TREY: LIKE HELL IT IS.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.637
NELSON: OH.
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.160
BUT YOUR GODS ARE DEAD

11:23.204 --> 11:24.988
AND THEY ARE NOT
COMING BACK THIS TIME.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.773
TELL THAT TO
RUSSELL PRIME, NULL.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.732
I WILL.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.561
RIGHT BEFORE WE BURN HIM
AT THE STAKE.

11:32.604 --> 11:33.954
YOU THINK KILLING
OUR GOD WILL GET

11:33.997 --> 11:35.695
YOUR PARENTS
TO LOVE YOU AGAIN?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.918
NOW MY MONEY'S ON THE GUYS
WITH THE GUNS.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.445
INDRA: CHILDREN OF GABRIEL,
STAND DOWN, NOW.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.275
THE OTHER GUNS.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.367
HERE COMES THE PART
WHERE THE CONVICTS
TAKE THE BLAME.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.934
CLARKE: WRONG.
BUT WHEN WE WOKE YOU

11:57.978 --> 11:59.980
TO CLEAR THE GROUND
FOR OUR COMPOUND,

12:00.023 --> 12:01.721
YOU AGREED TO STAY IN TENTS.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.679
THE PALACE IS OFF LIMITS.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.246
MILLER: THAT GOES
FOR THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL, TOO.

12:08.815 --> 12:12.079
OK. OK, YEAH,
THAT'S--THAT'S FINE.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.559
WE'LL--WE'LL TAKE
YOUR SCRAPS FOR NOW.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.996
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA
DO THE WORK,

12:16.039 --> 12:17.258
THEN WE'RE GONNA
HOLD YOU TO THE MEANING

12:17.301 --> 12:21.044
OF THE WORDS
"OUR COMPOUND."

12:21.088 --> 12:23.307
MM. LET'S GO.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.532
JORDAN.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.144
YOU WEREN'T AT
THE FARMHOUSE.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.493
WE SAVED YOU A ROOM.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.799
I'M OK ABOVE
THE TAVERN.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.760
CLARKE, THESE PEOPLE
WANT TO SEE RUSSELL.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.500
INDRA: OUT OF
THE QUESTION.

12:42.544 --> 12:45.112
NELSON: I TOLD YOU, YOU'LL
SEE HIM WHEN HE BURNS.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.114
MAYBE TAKE A LOG
OFF THE FIRE.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.857
NO ONE IS BURNING
AT THE STAKE.
NOT ANYMORE.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.075
THEN WHAT'S BEING
DONE WITH HIM?

12:53.511 --> 12:55.687
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED
THAT OUT YET.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.037
BUT HE'S BEING
WELL CARED FOR.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.821
WE CAN'T JUST TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR THAT.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.041
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MAN
WHO KILLED HER MOTHER.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.607
I SUGGEST YOU SAY
THANK YOU

13:02.651 --> 13:03.695
AND BE ON YOUR WAY.

13:03.739 --> 13:08.570
INDRA, IT'S OK.

13:08.613 --> 13:12.269
LOOK, YOU SEEM TO GET ON
JUST FINE WITH JORDAN.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.967
IF YOU WON'T TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT,

13:14.010 --> 13:15.098
HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE HIS?

13:33.377 --> 13:34.596
JORDAN: I KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.904
TO LOSE YOUR FAMILY
100 YEARS AGO

13:37.947 --> 13:39.993
AND YESTERDAY
AT THE SAME TIME.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.690
DID YOU KILL YOURS?

13:44.171 --> 13:46.390
DIDN'T THINK SO.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.262
YOU UNDERSTAND
A BARE WHISPER

13:48.305 --> 13:49.872
OF THE AGONY
I FEEL.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.265
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE NOT EATING?

13:53.702 --> 13:55.791
OR SLEEPING, FROM
THE LOOKS OF IT?

13:55.835 --> 13:59.751
I DON'T NEED
SLEEP OR FOOD.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.101
I NEED DEATH!

14:03.930 --> 14:05.148
YOU LOOK SURPRISED.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.108
OR IS THAT CONCERN
I SEE?

14:09.587 --> 14:10.937
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

14:13.504 --> 14:14.766
YOUR PEOPLE
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

14:14.810 --> 14:15.942
YOU'RE BEING
TREATED WELL.

14:18.422 --> 14:19.597
WHY DO THEY TRUST YOU?

14:21.164 --> 14:22.470
NEVER MIND.
I DON'T CARE.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.124
TELL THEM
I'M BEING TREATED

14:24.167 --> 14:25.865
BETTER THAN
I DESERVE.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.692
NOW GET OUT!

14:46.842 --> 14:49.584
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE THIS.

14:58.593 --> 15:01.988
YOU WERE ADJUSTED.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.121
SO, NOW YOU BELIEVE

15:05.165 --> 15:06.688
IN THE DIVINITY
OF THE PRIMES?

15:06.731 --> 15:07.819
IS THAT IT?

15:09.386 --> 15:11.301
NO.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.042
I KNOW YOU'RE
JUST A MAN

15:13.086 --> 15:14.435
WHO LOST HIS WAY.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.657
THEN TELL ME--
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.097
YOU GOT A GLIMPSE.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.100
A GLIMPSE?

15:27.143 --> 15:29.754
OF THE TRUTH
GREATER THAN US ALL.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.408
YES. NO.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.021
I DON'T KNOW.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.109
LET ME GUESS.

15:37.632 --> 15:38.807
YOU SAW THIS.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.071
YOU SAW IT, TOO?

15:43.507 --> 15:44.595
OF COURSE.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.425
I CREATED ALL OF
SANCTUM IN ITS IMAGE.

15:53.604 --> 15:54.866
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

15:57.608 --> 15:59.219
I STOPPED TRYING
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

15:59.262 --> 16:00.829
100 YEARS AGO.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.962
LOOKS LIKE IT'S YOUR
CROSS TO BEAR NOW.

16:04.659 --> 16:05.703
UHH!

16:10.230 --> 16:13.059
UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED
TO DO THE SAME TO ME,

16:13.102 --> 16:14.451
WE'RE DONE HERE.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.658
ECHO: BELLAMY!
CALL OUT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME!

16:52.924 --> 16:54.230
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

16:54.274 --> 16:55.231
MAKING SURE WE'RE
NOT BEING FOLLOWED.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.798
FOLLOWED BY WHAT?

16:56.841 --> 16:58.452
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

16:58.495 --> 16:59.888
NO.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.254
HOPE: AAH!
GABRIEL: HOPE, NO, STOP.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.042
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.136
WHO ARE YOU?

17:30.179 --> 17:32.051
WHERE'S OCTAVIA,
AND WHY ARE THEY

17:32.094 --> 17:33.443
TAKING BELLAMY
TO THE ANOMALY?

17:33.487 --> 17:34.966
BELLAMY'S GONE?

17:35.010 --> 17:37.012
GABRIEL: YOU KNOW HIM?
YOU REMEMBER?

17:37.056 --> 17:41.060
NO. YOU CALLED TO HIM
FROM THE TENT.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.367
THIS...WAS IN MY ARM.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.286
"TRUST BELLAMY."

17:50.330 --> 17:51.461
I DON'T REMEMBER
PUTTING IT THERE,

17:51.505 --> 17:52.854
BUT I THINK
I MUST HAVE.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.902
IT'S ANOTHER CODE.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.079
LIKE THE ONE
ON OCTAVIA'S BACK.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.602
WHAT'S IT FOR?

18:01.645 --> 18:03.038
HOPE: I DON'T KNOW.
ECHO: STOP LYING!

18:03.082 --> 18:04.518
GABRIEL: EASY.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.998
OCTAVIA LOST
HER MEMORY, TOO.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.566
MUST BE A RESULT OF
MOVING THROUGH THE ANOMALY.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.786
HOPE: WHAT'S THE ANOMALY?
ECHO: YOU TELL US.

18:11.829 --> 18:12.961
GABRIEL: IT'S THE SOUND
YOU HEAR.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.484
YOU SAID
OCTAVIA'S NAME

18:14.528 --> 18:16.530
RIGHT BEFORE
YOU STABBED HER.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.271
YOU REMEMBERED THEN,

18:18.314 --> 18:20.142
AND YOU REMEMBER NOW.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.057
THE ANOMALY WAS
ON TOP OF US THEN.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.147
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
THEN SHE LOST HER MEMORY

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
WHEN IT RECEDED...

18:27.193 --> 18:28.846
TAKING OCTAVIA WITH IT.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.545
WHY JUST HER?
WHY THE MEMORY LOSS?

18:33.024 --> 18:34.156
NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE,

18:34.200 --> 18:35.897
BUT, MY GOD, IT'S INCREDIBLE.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.464
WE NEED TO GET
TO BELLAMY.

18:40.554 --> 18:41.903
HOW FAST CAN YOU RUN?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.078
I DON'T KNOW.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.341
LET'S FIND OUT.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.762
MURPHY: CLOWNS TO
THE LEFT OF ME,

19:14.805 --> 19:16.155
JOKERS TO THE RIGHT.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.982
EMORI: STOP IT.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.854
HERE.
LISTEN TO THIS.

19:19.897 --> 19:23.074
KAYLEE CHANGED
BECAUSE OF LOVE, TOO.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.772
ISAAC, A NULL,

19:24.815 --> 19:26.208
MADE HER SEE
WHAT THEY'D BECOME.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.992
AWW. FARMER
LOVING THE PIG

19:28.036 --> 19:29.298
SHE LEADS TO
THE SLAUGHTER.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.173
JACKSON DIDN'T
MEAN IT, JOHN.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.874
YOU DIDN'T KILL ABBY.
RUSSELL DID.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.311
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS
GONNA BE GOOD FOR HER.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.271
I TOLD THEM THAT
ABBY COULD MAKE

19:45.314 --> 19:46.489
NIGHTBLOOD OUT
OF BONE MARROW.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.925
YOU DID THAT
TO SAVE US ALL.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.623
I HELPED JOSEPHINE
CONVINCE ABBY

19:49.666 --> 19:50.885
THAT SHE WAS CLARKE.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.368
BLESSED
IS DANIEL.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.456
BLESSED IS--

19:58.980 --> 20:01.025
I--I'M SO SORRY,
MY LORD.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.072
I GOT THIS.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.334
IT'S OK.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.683
HE'S CLEARLY
HAD ENOUGH.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.604
LOOK, YOU GOT IT
ALL WRONG.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.215
I KNOW YOU THINK THAT I'M--

20:16.258 --> 20:17.955
RAVEN: DANIEL, CAN I--

20:17.999 --> 20:19.000
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

20:19.043 --> 20:20.088
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.921
ACT LIKE YOU
HARDLY KNOW ME.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.401
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.060
THIS PLACE IS
A POWDER KEG.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.846
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.022
MISS MORALITY WANTS US
TO BE PRIMES.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.285
NEWSFLASH:
YOU ARE PRIMES.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.461
THAT BAD CHOICE
HAS SAILED.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.202
BUT IF THESE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY BELIEVE

20:47.246 --> 20:49.204
YOU'RE DANIEL
AND KAYLEE,

20:49.248 --> 20:50.597
IT MAY STILL
DO US SOME GOOD.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.731
THE ANSWER'S NO.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.212
DANIEL.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.912
HE BLAMES HIMSELF
FOR ABBY.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.220
RAVEN: THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.310
HOW'S RUSSELL?

21:08.354 --> 21:10.094
TREY: WHAT'D HE SAY?
JORDAN: IT'S OK.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.879
TREY: DON'T TELL ME IT'S OK.
WE HAVE TO HELP HIM.

21:11.922 --> 21:15.361
EVERYONE, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.147
NELSON: CHILDREN OF GABRIEL,
LET'S MOVE.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.411
RAVEN: HERE WE GO AGAIN.
MAN: GET OUT OF THE WAY. MOVE.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.502
IT'S A RIOT AGAIN.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.987
JORDAN: TREY, JUST
HANG ON FOR A SECOND.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.728
TREY: FREE RUSSELL PRIME!

21:34.771 --> 21:36.643
HOW DARE YOU PUT HIM IN A CAGE!

21:36.686 --> 21:38.340
NELSON: A CAGE IS
BETTER THAN HE DESERVES.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.740
TREY: EVERYONE.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.437
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
AND GET RUSSELL
OUT OF THERE.

21:48.481 --> 21:49.830
CLARKE: HEY.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.048
THEY'RE GOING
FOR RUSSELL.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.094
TREY: LET US SEE OUR GOD!

21:53.137 --> 21:54.965
LET US SEE HIM!

21:55.009 --> 21:56.793
GIVE US RUSSELL!

21:56.837 --> 21:58.360
I'M MOVING HIM
TO THE PALACE

21:58.404 --> 22:00.014
WHERE WE CAN
PROTECT HIM.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.581
CLARKE: WE SAID THE PALACE
WAS OFF LIMITS.

22:01.624 --> 22:02.973
EVERY BATTLE PLAN
IS PERFECT

22:03.017 --> 22:04.540
TILL THE FIRST SHOT
IS FIRED.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.150
RAVEN: AND THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL?

22:06.194 --> 22:07.369
INDRA: THEY'LL BE UNHAPPY.
IT'S EITHER THIS,

22:07.413 --> 22:08.501
OR WE EXECUTE HIM NOW

22:08.544 --> 22:10.241
AND BE DONE
WITH IT.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.113
HEY, THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.507
HE WANTS TO BE KILLED.
THAT'S ALL I TOLD THEM.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.465
THEN LET'S GIVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTS.

22:16.509 --> 22:17.988
DEATH TO PRIMES!

22:20.382 --> 22:22.297
WE HAVE TO
DO THIS NOW.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.476
NELSON: DEATH TO PRIMES!

22:27.520 --> 22:28.869
GET BACK, GET BACK!

22:36.703 --> 22:38.269
WE'RE MOVING YOU
SOMEPLACE SAFE.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.318
WHY ARE YOU
PROTECTING THE MAN

22:43.362 --> 22:44.406
WHO KILLED YOUR MOTHER?

22:44.450 --> 22:45.842
EXCELLENT QUESTION.

22:50.499 --> 22:54.155
IF I COULD KILL YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID,

22:54.198 --> 22:55.765
I WOULDN'T HESITATE.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.899
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

23:09.736 --> 23:10.998
NELSON: THERE HE IS!

23:15.568 --> 23:17.744
DEATH TO PRIMES!

23:24.838 --> 23:26.405
TREY: WE WON'T LET YOU KILL HIM!

23:26.448 --> 23:27.928
JORDAN: HANG ON!
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.017
GET OUT OF THE WAY.
WE ARE MOVING HIM

23:30.060 --> 23:31.758
TO THE PALACE
FOR HIS OWN SAFETY.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.237
JORDAN: NOBODY HAS TO GET HURT!
INDRA, STOP!

23:33.281 --> 23:34.282
TREY: YOU DON'T BELONG HERE!

23:42.769 --> 23:45.728
HAVE WE
LEARNED NOTHING? HUH?

23:47.077 --> 23:48.122
LET THEM PASS!

23:50.951 --> 23:52.343
WE CAN TRUST WONKRU.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.390
AFTER ALL...

23:58.262 --> 23:59.307
WE ARE ONE.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.007
WE ARE ONE.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.624
-LET'S GO.
-RUSSELL!

24:13.408 --> 24:15.454
MAN: LET'S GO.
SECOND MAN: RIGHT NOW.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.109
"WE ARE ONE"?

24:19.153 --> 24:20.894
IT'S FROM
KAYLEE'S JOURNAL.

24:20.937 --> 24:23.679
HER SLOGAN WHEN SHE
STOPPED OBLATION.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.725
YOU ARE SO HOT
RIGHT NOW.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.161
SISTER.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.512
MY IDEA.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.340
GOOD ONE.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.733
OF COURSE,
NOW THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL

24:33.776 --> 24:35.299
WANT THEM DEAD.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.518
THE LENGTHS
SOME PEOPLE WILL GO

24:36.562 --> 24:38.738
TO LIVE IN
A CASTLE.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.566
EMORI: WE GET
TO LIVE IN THE CASTLE?

24:40.609 --> 24:42.219
MILLER: IF THEY'RE GONNA
GET MURDERED IN THEIR SLEEP,

24:42.263 --> 24:43.394
BETTER THERE THAN AT
THE FARMHOUSE WITH US.

24:43.438 --> 24:44.395
RAVEN: HE DOES
HAVE A POINT.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.528
I NEED MY 8 HOURS.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.791
OK. FOR NOW.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.401
AT LEAST UNTIL
THEY KILL YOU.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.512
WHY DID YOU
DRAW THESE?

25:13.555 --> 25:15.557
MM, I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS BORED

25:15.601 --> 25:17.167
WHILE THEY WERE TEACHING
US ABOUT THE PRIMES.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.214
WHY ARE THEY
STILL DOING THAT

25:20.257 --> 25:21.520
IF THEY KNOW
THE TRUTH?

25:21.563 --> 25:23.043
I SUPPOSE
SOMETIMES BELIEF

25:23.086 --> 25:24.348
IS STRONGER
THAN THE TRUTH.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.789
HI. SORRY WE'RE LATE.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.399
NO PROBLEM.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

25:31.442 --> 25:33.619
THAT MADI AND I
ALREADY ATE.

25:33.662 --> 25:34.924
YOU KNOW, WHILE
YOU WERE OFF

25:34.968 --> 25:36.578
REBUILDING SANCTUM
BY HAND.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.841
WHO KNEW PUTTING
A BROKEN SOCIETY
BACK TOGETHER

25:38.885 --> 25:40.190
WOULD BE
HARD WORK?

25:43.890 --> 25:45.108
CLARKE...

25:46.849 --> 25:48.851
I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE LATE.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.244
I CARE WHY YOU ARE.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.682
CLARKE: MADI, INDRA'S RIGHT.

25:53.726 --> 25:54.944
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.643
STOP IT.
TALK TO ME.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.344
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE A MOM.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.475
AND I CAN HELP.

26:04.519 --> 26:08.044
HEY. I'M STILL HERE.

26:09.655 --> 26:10.786
YOU DIDN'T LOSE ME.

26:12.309 --> 26:13.659
NOT YOU, CLARKE.

26:19.534 --> 26:20.927
SHE DIED IN MY ARMS.

26:22.711 --> 26:23.930
I KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE.

26:32.416 --> 26:35.419
WELL, THE WOMAN
I FLOATED

26:35.463 --> 26:36.638
WAS NOT MY MOM.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.294
I'M FINE, MADI. REALLY.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.778
I'M GOING TO BED.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.222
NOT MY FINEST MOMENT.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.093
INDRA: DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.573
YOU HANDLED THAT WELL.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.227
GAIA: YOU WOULD THINK THAT.

27:00.270 --> 27:03.273
AFTER MY FATHER DIED,
CRYING WAS FORBIDDEN.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.537
WE WERE AT WAR.
IT MADE YOU STRONG.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.627
IT MADE ME BECOME
A FLEIMKEPA.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.415
THE QUESTION IS,
WHO IS THE FLEIMKEPA

27:14.458 --> 27:15.634
WITHOUT A FLAME?

27:17.592 --> 27:19.899
WE ALL HAVE TO FIND
OUR OWN NEW PATH.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.259
I JUST REALIZED
I NEVER THANKED YOU.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.479
THE FLAME WAS
YOUR WHOLE WORLD,

27:35.523 --> 27:37.656
AND YET YOU CHOSE
TO SAVE MADI.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.396
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW HARD

27:39.440 --> 27:40.659
THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN FOR YOU.

27:42.791 --> 27:43.879
THANK YOU.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.930
YOU SHOULD, UM,
SEE THIS.

27:50.973 --> 27:53.672
SHE'S DRAWING MEMORIES
THAT ARE NOT HER OWN.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.457
SHEIDHEDA?

27:56.500 --> 27:57.937
I DON'T KNOW.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.590
IT COULD BE ANY
OF THE COMMANDERS

27:59.634 --> 28:01.244
OR ALL OF THEM.

28:01.288 --> 28:02.724
I'LL KEEP
AN EYE ON IT.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.380
I'M GLAD SHE HAS YOU
IN HER LIFE.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.695
THE NIGHT WANHEDA
KNELT TO HEDA.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.393
I'M SORRY I MISSED THAT.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.701
SEEMS LIKE ANOTHER WORLD.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.406
NEW WORLD.
SAME PROBLEMS.

28:32.449 --> 28:33.668
I GOT MADI.
GO ON.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.325
THANK YOU.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.421
WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.901
TOO MUCH TOXIN
IN THE AIR.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.295
I AM NOT
IN THE MOOD TO SEE

28:52.339 --> 28:53.688
MY GHOST RIGHT NOW, ARE YOU?

29:02.175 --> 29:04.220
GABRIEL:
RAY GUNS. COOL.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.744
IF IT SHOOTS,
IT CAN BE SHOT AT.

29:09.486 --> 29:12.228
THAT WAS A BAD SHOT,
EVEN FROM FAR AWAY.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.888
ECHO? ECHO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:22.891 --> 29:24.458
TESTING A THEORY.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.677
A THEORY?
IF YOU'RE WRONG--

29:32.509 --> 29:33.989
SHE'S NOT WRONG.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.512
IT'S NOT TRYING
TO KILL US.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.735
WE'RE NOT PLAYING
BY THE SAME RULES.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.215
ECHO, LOOK AROUND YOU.

29:42.258 --> 29:43.433
THE PARTICULATE
MATTER MOVES

29:43.477 --> 29:45.044
IN RESPONSE TO MOTION.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.219
THEY COME
CLOSE ENOUGH...

29:46.262 --> 29:47.394
I'LL HAVE A TARGET.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.485
ECHO: TO SET THE TRAP,
WE HAVE TO

29:51.528 --> 29:52.878
OPEN UP A LEAD.

29:52.921 --> 29:53.966
FOLLOW ME.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.457
LISTEN.

30:10.809 --> 30:14.638
HERE IT COMES.
NO ONE MOVE,

30:14.682 --> 30:16.336
OR IT WON'T
COME CLOSE ENOUGH.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.515
ROAN: ONCE A KILLER,
ALWAYS A KILLER.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.169
YOU JUST SAID
DON'T MOVE.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.261
ROAN?

30:30.654 --> 30:33.266
YOU DIDN'T USE
THE ANTITOXIN, ECHO.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.267
ECHO, IT'S NOT REAL.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.008
ROAN: WITHOUT BELLAMY,

30:36.051 --> 30:37.400
WHO WILL YOU FOLLOW?

30:37.444 --> 30:38.575
ECHO: SHUT UP.
GABRIEL: QUIET.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.889
ECHO: NOW HE'S IN MY SHOT.
GABRIEL: SHUSH!

30:55.201 --> 30:56.898
ANSWER THE
QUESTION, ASH.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.379
ROAN: WITHOUT SOMEONE
TO FOLLOW, WHO ARE YOU?

31:01.990 --> 31:04.036
A GIRL WHO KILLED
HER ONLY FRIEND

31:04.079 --> 31:05.124
AND STOLE HER NAME?

31:05.167 --> 31:06.647
ROAN: THE HONORLESS SPY

31:06.690 --> 31:08.518
WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR HER QUEEN,

31:08.562 --> 31:10.869
EVEN BETRAY THE MAN
SHE NOW CLAIMS TO LOVE?

31:12.087 --> 31:14.524
ECHO? ECHO, IT'S CLOSE.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.310
I CAN DO THIS.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.924
OCTAVIA: HOPE.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.665
YOU HAVE
TO STAY QUIET.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.319
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU HEAR,

31:26.362 --> 31:27.842
YOU STAY QUIET.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.191
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.762
HOPE, IT'S
JUST IN YOUR MIND.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.242
OCTAVIA:
I PROMISE YOU,

31:36.285 --> 31:38.157
MOMMY AND AUNTY O
WILL COME BACK FOR YOU.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.684
NO, NO, DON'T--

31:43.727 --> 31:44.990
STAY DOWN.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.646
GABRIEL: ECHO,
THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.
TAKE THE SHOT.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.040
NOW. PULL THE TRIGGER NOW.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.824
I'M SORRY.

32:05.575 --> 32:06.750
ECHO: GABRIEL,
THERE COULD BE MORE.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.317
WE HAVE TO GO. NOW.

32:08.361 --> 32:09.666
GABRIEL: WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.539
ECHO: GABRIEL--
GABRIEL: HOLD ON.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.895
HE'S JUST A MAN.
SAME TATTOOS AS YOURS.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.734
GABRIEL: LISTEN.
ECHO: WHAT IS IT?

32:33.777 --> 32:35.736
GABRIEL: THE ANOMALY.
IT'S QUIETER.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.783
THEY'RE SHUTTING IT DOWN.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.220
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:41.263 --> 32:43.004
GABRIEL: IT MEANS
THEY CAN CONTROL IT.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.440
WHAT IF IT MEANS
THEY'RE TAKING
BELLAMY THROUGH

32:44.484 --> 32:46.268
AND THEY DON'T
WANT US TO FOLLOW?

32:46.312 --> 32:47.487
GABRIEL, SOFTLY: LET'S GO.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.755
ECHO: BELLAMY!
GABRIEL: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.757
GABRIEL: SLOW DOWN. ECHO.
ECHO: IT'S CLOSING!

32:56.800 --> 32:58.759
GABRIEL: WE GO THROUGH TOGETHER.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.239
IF WE'RE EVEN
SECONDS APART,

33:00.282 --> 33:02.023
WE COULD BE SEPARATED
BY MONTHS. OK?

33:26.874 --> 33:28.615
INDRA: WE HEARD AN EXPLOSION.
MILLER, REPORT.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.660
MILLER: THEY BLEW UP
A CONTAINER ON THE LOWER LEVEL

33:30.704 --> 33:32.097
TO PULL OUR ATTENTION
AWAY FROM THE PALACE.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.707
THERE'S A DOZEN
HARDCORE BELIEVERS

33:33.750 --> 33:35.317
OUTSIDE RUSSELL'S
QUARTERS RIGHT NOW.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.102
THE ADJUSTERS ARE
BACK IN THEIR BIBS.

33:37.145 --> 33:38.625
OUR GUARDS
AT THEIR DOOR,

33:38.668 --> 33:40.105
THEY WITHDREW WITHOUT ENGAGING.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.976
CLARKE: THAT WAS
THE RIGHT CALL, MILLER.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.456
NO ONE ELSE SHOULD DIE
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.327
WHAT OTHER REASON
IS THERE TO DIE?

33:45.371 --> 33:46.937
NELSON: I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

33:49.810 --> 33:52.030
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING HERE?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.596
HE'S UNARMED.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.294
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
HAVE DEMANDS.

33:55.337 --> 33:56.860
CLARKE: GET IN LINE.
NELSON: YOU WANT PEACE,

33:56.904 --> 33:58.427
WE WANT RUSSELL PRIME.

33:58.471 --> 33:59.994
THE PEOPLE
THAT LIVE HERE

34:00.038 --> 34:01.300
SHOULD DECIDE RUSSELL'S FATE,
NOT US.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.693
NELSON: THIS IS
OUR HOME, TOO.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.566
WE WERE THROWN OUT
LIKE GARBAGE.

34:06.609 --> 34:09.525
MY PARENTS ARE STILL HERE

34:09.569 --> 34:11.788
AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

34:11.832 --> 34:14.008
THE PRIMES DID THAT.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.663
I'M SORRY THAT
HAPPENED TO YOU.

34:16.706 --> 34:18.360
BUT WE'RE NOT
LETTING YOU HAVE RUSSELL.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.493
EITHER RUSSELL
PRIME DIES,

34:20.536 --> 34:22.234
OR KAYLEE
AND DANIEL DO.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.800
MILLER: COME ON, NELSON.

34:23.844 --> 34:24.888
YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT
DANIEL AND KAYLEE.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.675
YOU WANT THEM TO PLAY DRESS-UP

34:28.718 --> 34:30.633
SO YOU CAN CONTROL
THE SHEEP, FINE.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.940
BUT RUSSELL PRIME IS OURS.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.248
YOU HAVE TILL TOMORROW'S
SECOND MOON TO DECIDE.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.824
THE MAN DOES DESERVE
TO DIE, CLARKE.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.740
MAYBE.
BUT THE KIND OF SOCIETY

34:50.784 --> 34:52.264
I WANT MY CHILD
TO GROW UP IN

34:52.307 --> 34:53.787
DOESN'T TAKE
AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

34:53.830 --> 34:58.139
CLARKE, HE
KILLED YOUR--

34:58.183 --> 35:01.751
FINE. WE'LL
CLEAR OUT THE FANATICS.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.927
NO. NO MORE VIOLENCE.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.365
SO, HOW DO
WE DO IT?

35:07.801 --> 35:11.109
WE DON'T.
RUSSELL DOES.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.763
I'LL GET JORDAN.
HE'S IN THE TAVERN.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.680
TREY: WE INVOKE THE NAMES
OF THE PRIMES AS WE PRAY.

35:19.160 --> 35:26.863
JOSEPHINE...SIMONE...
PRIYA...RUSS--

35:28.691 --> 35:29.953
FAITHFUL, BLOCK THE WAY.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.567
SHE JUST WANTS
TO SEE RUSSELL.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.710
YOU WERE GONNA
SEARCH ME, RIGHT?

35:47.754 --> 35:49.277
YOU WOULDN'T BE
DUMB ENOUGH TO LET

35:49.321 --> 35:51.105
SOMEONE BRING A GUN
IN TO SEE YOUR GOD.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.280
JORDAN: IT'S OK, TREY.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.716
YOU CAN TRUST HER.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.201
LET HER PASS.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.876
THEY DIDN'T
UNCHAIN YOU.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.051
I WOULDN'T
LET THEM.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.015
I NEED YOU TO ORDER
YOUR PEOPLE

36:32.059 --> 36:33.191
TO LEAVE THE PALACE.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.153
TELL ME, CLARKE...

36:39.197 --> 36:40.198
HOW DO YOU GO ON

36:40.241 --> 36:42.156
AFTER YOU LOSE EVERYTHING?

36:44.463 --> 36:47.509
YOU TAKE A BREATH.
THEN ANOTHER.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.685
THAT'S IT.

36:49.729 --> 36:51.861
NOW WILL YOU GIVE
THE ORDER OR NOT?

37:03.656 --> 37:06.354
IF I'D HAVE KILLED
MADI WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

37:06.398 --> 37:07.921
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

37:09.792 --> 37:13.274
WAIT. I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.109
SIMONE LEFT
THESE HERE,

37:22.152 --> 37:24.242
AFTER SHE WAS
RESURRECTED.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.113
THEY WERE YOUR
MOTHER'S.

37:26.156 --> 37:27.636
I THOUGHT YOU'D
WANT THEM BACK.

37:55.577 --> 37:56.752
FOR MY MOTHER!

38:01.322 --> 38:02.323
GET UP.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.935
CLARKE: UHH!

38:09.809 --> 38:11.854
-UHH!
-UGH!

38:17.425 --> 38:18.557
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

38:20.036 --> 38:23.344
YES. DO IT.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.999
PULL THE TRIGGER.
SET ME FREE.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.132
-AAH!
-UHH!

38:53.331 --> 38:56.029
I'M SO SORRY.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.649
SHEIDHEDA: HELLO,
RUSSELL PRIME.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.172
I PREFER
YOUR NEW BODY.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.828
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

39:12.872 --> 39:14.003
WHO ARE YOU?

39:27.147 --> 39:29.149
MILLER: CLARKE,
OPEN THE DOOR!

39:57.612 --> 39:59.397
LOOKS LIKE
YOU BURN AFTER ALL.

40:02.922 --> 40:05.794
PLEASE. DO NOT
LEAVE ME HERE.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.627
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT MADI TO DO?

40:39.088 --> 40:40.916
NO! UHH!

40:40.960 --> 40:42.004
LET IT BURN.

40:47.749 --> 40:50.448
SANCTUM IS FREE!

40:52.754 --> 40:56.366
THERE ARE NO KINGS OR QUEENS

40:56.410 --> 40:58.978
OR PRIMES HERE!

40:59.021 --> 41:02.677
WE HAVE NO USE FOR A PALACE.

41:02.721 --> 41:07.029
WE ARE THE LAST
OF THE HUMAN RACE,

41:07.073 --> 41:09.118
AND WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES.

41:11.730 --> 41:16.474
TOMORROW, RUSSELL PRIME
DIES FOR HIS.
