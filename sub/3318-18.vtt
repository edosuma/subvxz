00:33.601 --> 00:35.334
Bash:
<i>It's not what we chose.</i>

00:35.336 --> 00:37.136
We're married
before king and god.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.804
You are pregnant
with my husband's child.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.139
And if francis finds out...

00:40.141 --> 00:41.473
I will do my very best to marry.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.342
The beautiful creature
standing beside me

00:43.344 --> 00:45.210
Has agreed to be my wife!

00:45.212 --> 00:47.346
Have you changed your mind?
I'm pregnant.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.614
You look very pretty.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.083
Perhaps it is time
to rejoin society.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.052
I can give you the pleasure
you offer others.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.354
These days he seems infatuated
by penelope.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.189
<i>Barely even notices</i>
<i>affairs of state.</i>

00:57.191 --> 01:00.426
You are ill-- you could do harm
to yourself, to France.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.393
We have waited a long time

01:01.395 --> 01:04.363
For you to rise.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.432
Mary:
<i>If it ever becomes a choice</i>
<i>between our two countries,</i>

01:06.434 --> 01:08.200
I will choose mine.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.304
What's this?

01:12.306 --> 01:13.539
A wedding ring.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.773
It's modest, I know.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.408
It belonged to my grandmother.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.609
Huh.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.311
I thought diane de poitiers
came from money.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.081
(sighs)
well, if you don't want it...

01:22.083 --> 01:23.415
I didn't say that.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.085
It's just...

01:26.087 --> 01:27.152
Well, why?

01:27.154 --> 01:28.153
We're married.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.354
We can't be un-married.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.156
I thought we'd agreed
to at least try.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.157
(wry laugh)

01:32.159 --> 01:33.292
How romantic.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.327
Yes, let's...

01:35.329 --> 01:38.630
Try.

01:38.632 --> 01:42.568
Well, there's a promising start.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.139
They've spared no expense
for lola's wedding.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.740
Bares no resemblance
to mine.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.642
Try not to be bitter
on lola's special day.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.511
Kenna, greer, I found you!

01:52.513 --> 01:54.613
Look at this necklace
julien just gave me.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.515
Kenna:
Well, now I am bitter.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.484
Those sapphires are
the size of grapes.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.585
It's gorgeous.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.487
But why are you
talking to julien

02:01.489 --> 02:02.688
Before your wedding?
And why aren't you dressed?

02:02.690 --> 02:03.689
The ceremony's in less

02:03.691 --> 02:04.690
Than an hour.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.191
Wish me luck. And happiness.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.726
With all of our hearts.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.196
I think they have a chance.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.431
She seems so

02:12.433 --> 02:13.532
Hopeful and excited.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.535
Once castleroy returns
from his business.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.137
We haven't set a date yet.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.439
You might as well
as it's inevitable.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.608
Your reputation can't do
with a broken engagement.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.143
Thank you for the reminder.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.145
At least castleroy's
title is real.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.647
Well, the master
of horse and hunt

02:28.649 --> 02:30.249
May not have any lands but...

02:30.251 --> 02:32.584
At least bash is
young and handsome.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.553
I suppose he is, isn't he?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.622
How are things between you two?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.390
I don't know.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.391
I can sense that he's trying.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.692
But the fact that he has to...

02:40.694 --> 02:43.395
Imagine how awful our wedding
was, how monstrous...

02:43.397 --> 02:45.731
Henry:
Lady kenna?

02:48.568 --> 02:50.636
Your grace.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.571
I can see by your dress

02:52.573 --> 02:54.239
That you're still trying to...

02:54.241 --> 02:55.541
Impress your king.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.312
It's working.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.650
(grunts)

03:07.720 --> 03:10.189
Don't hide yourself away.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.224
Or I'll have to come find you.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.261
This...

03:16.263 --> 03:17.429
Itches.

03:24.237 --> 03:27.806
How is this marriage
ever going to work?

03:39.619 --> 03:40.752
Oh.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.921
Oh, dear.
Did I step on your toes?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.890
Are those tears of pain?

03:44.892 --> 03:45.891
No.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.993
I'm just so grateful.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.728
You're too good to me.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.929
Do go on, wife.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.232
This day, this necklace,

03:53.234 --> 03:55.534
Marrying me,

03:55.536 --> 03:56.802
Even in my situation.

03:56.804 --> 03:57.903
No more of that talk.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.471
I've only given you

03:59.473 --> 04:01.406
What you deserve.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.642
From now on, we're
in this together.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.711
No secrets, no shame.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.745
Just the two of us

04:06.747 --> 04:08.814
On the adventure of our lives.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.823
Francis:
Pleased to see you
enjoying yourself.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.025
It wasn't so long ago
you were ready

04:20.027 --> 04:21.960
To rain anarchy
down on this place.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.630
It wasn't so long ago
that your parents were trying

04:24.632 --> 04:26.732
To trick me into bequeathing
them scotland.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.834
That's enough merriment
for you two.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.403
We have problems.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.972
Well, then.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.807
Mother, what's so wrong
that it can't wait

04:35.809 --> 04:37.376
The length of a dance?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.745
That impatient-looking man
over there

04:39.747 --> 04:41.813
Is cardinal morosini,
the pope's new envoy.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.815
Don't look now.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.385
I thought the cardinal wasn't
due for another week.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.020
The weather cleared in the
alps, and he left early.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.789
He came all this way
to see henry.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.326
But your father seems
to have chosen not to attend.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.861
Well, maybe that's a blessing,

04:55.863 --> 04:58.864
Seeing how father is feeling.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.666
Can't the cardinal be told
that the king's indisposed?

05:00.668 --> 05:02.801
For an entire week?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.637
That's how long the
cardinal is staying.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.572
He wants to renegotiate leases

05:07.574 --> 05:08.807
On the pope's tenancies
in France.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.310
We depend on that income.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.945
Francis:
Can't you negotiate with him?

05:13.947 --> 05:15.781
Let's just say that the
cardinal wasn't my choice

05:15.783 --> 05:18.417
For his current position,
and he's well aware of it.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.785
There might be another way.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.720
I have an idea.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.926
I'm not sure about this.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.494
Trust me.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.729
Just follow my lead.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.764
Cardinal morosini,
what an honor

05:32.766 --> 05:34.066
And a pleasure to meet you.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.601
Your grace, a pleasure indeed.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.070
Dauphin.

05:39.739 --> 05:40.906
You'll forgive
our presumptions.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.008
We thought you might agree,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.910
As francis and I are the future
of France and scotland,

05:44.912 --> 05:46.611
And you are the
future of rome,

05:46.613 --> 05:47.779
That we might discuss

05:47.781 --> 05:49.715
The, uh, um...

05:49.717 --> 05:51.350
How should I say it?

05:51.352 --> 05:53.819
The intimacies
of our papal relations?

05:53.821 --> 05:56.355
I'm not sure what you mean.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.090
Well, you're here to discuss
rents and tenancies, yes?

05:58.092 --> 06:00.759
With king henry, indeed.

06:00.761 --> 06:04.830
I'm sure henry will sign off
on anything that we agree on.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.399
Tell me, are cardinals
permitted to dance?

06:07.401 --> 06:09.835
To further
the interests of rome,

06:09.837 --> 06:10.836
Why not?

06:10.838 --> 06:14.639
Then let us go further.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.775
(clears throat)

06:16.777 --> 06:18.777
Have you learned anything?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.045
Where is henry?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.613
Queen penelope told me

06:21.615 --> 06:22.881
To tell you that
the king is quite

06:22.883 --> 06:24.950
Tied up.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.888
Oh, good lord.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.490
(sighs)

06:31.492 --> 06:33.825
Where is penelope?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.394
She's gone to get supplies.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.829
The waiting is horrible.

06:37.831 --> 06:38.897
I love it.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.898
Henry...

06:39.900 --> 06:41.566
That girl is humiliating us.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.403
She's a thief.
She's looting the castle.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.405
There are rumors
that you have gifted her

06:46.407 --> 06:47.973
An entire estate.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.674
She deserves it.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.877
People are talking

06:51.879 --> 06:54.479
About your behavior.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.914
Her control over you.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.916
Rumors could reach the vatican.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.752
Is the cardinal already here?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.754
You've had your fun
with the girl.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.922
But it has to stop.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.023
Now.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.527
I will not be
so demeaned by a woman!

07:08.529 --> 07:10.662
Yes, I can see that.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.834
Your grace,
I've come to announce

07:15.836 --> 07:18.970
The arrival of james stewart,
earl of moray.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.908
My lord earl of moray.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.075
Why are you still on your knees?

07:24.077 --> 07:27.679
Your grace, I always kneel
before my queen.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.981
Please, stand up.
I am also your sister.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.083
Half sister.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.985
Oh, james, you've grown a beard.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.620
It suits you.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.191
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming?

07:39.193 --> 07:40.926
There was no time.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.994
Your mother, marie de guise,
is in trouble.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.529
And she needs your help.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.998
Yes, we fund her troubles.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.934
Mary, this is real.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.870
And the french help you sent
hasn't proved a solution.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.572
It's rather the problem.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.906
Well, I don't understand.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.942
Your mother is french,
and so are

07:56.944 --> 07:58.710
Half the men she has
running scotland's affairs.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.712
Scots want their
affairs managed

08:00.714 --> 08:02.881
By men who share
their nationality.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.916
And they want it more
passionately every day.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.619
And why hasn't my mother
attended to this problem?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.688
I'm not sure
she sees it or cares.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.256
Scots are a crude people to her.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.625
In need of french
leadership.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.094
You have
always resented my mother.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.063
But she serves me.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.966
Are you sure

08:20.968 --> 08:24.035
It is not me
that you truly resent?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.137
Are you sure it's not my rule
you wish to change?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.974
If it were, do you think

08:28.976 --> 08:30.642
I'd have come here
to tip my hand?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.677
Then why are you here?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.013
Do you want me to tell my mother
to bring more scots

08:35.015 --> 08:37.015
Into her government?
One will do.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.216
For the moment.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.885
Who? You?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.186
You.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.988
Scotland needs

08:42.990 --> 08:44.523
To see her queen.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.757
To bow before her as I do,

08:45.759 --> 08:49.027
With pride and with duty.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.929
Come home to scotland.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.697
Come home.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.841
Now? You want to go
to scotland now?

09:02.843 --> 09:04.676
James says it's now or never.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.211
The scots feel occupied

09:06.213 --> 09:09.114
By their french allies.
If we don't act now,

09:09.116 --> 09:10.949
They could end up hating you
more than they hate the english.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.918
It needs attention,
I can see that.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.954
But why does it need
your attention in person?

09:15.956 --> 09:18.123
So they can see that they
still have a scottish queen.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.759
So I can strengthen
my mother's rule.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.761
And then, if that doesn't work,
then to replace her,

09:22.763 --> 09:24.095
With someone
who can rule for me.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.097
Well, then let me
send diplomats.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.699
Let me help you
determine the answers

09:27.701 --> 09:29.034
Without sending you
into the middle

09:29.036 --> 09:30.101
Of so much unrest.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.038
To solve the problem
of not enough scots?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.273
Mary, you convinced the cardinal

09:35.275 --> 09:37.142
To do business with us.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.977
You can't leave in the middle
of what you just started.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.145
Then finish it without me.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.980
I told him we were the future

09:41.982 --> 09:43.014
Of scotland and France,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.783
You and I both.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.151
You know perfectly well
why he doesn't insist

09:46.153 --> 09:47.652
On meeting with father.

09:47.654 --> 09:48.954
He keeps asking for you.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.955
He wants more of your flirting,

09:49.957 --> 09:51.056
Your innuendos.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.325
You want me to risk

09:53.327 --> 09:56.161
Scotland's health
to continue some game?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.697
To save France
some embarrassment?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.165
My father is mad.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.271
France is unstable
enough as it is.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.907
If word gets out of his madness,

10:08.909 --> 10:12.844
If rome pulls its
support and its money,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.714
This country could come apart.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.917
Mary, I promise I will travel
to scotland with you.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.151
Just not now.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.187
Please wait until
this deal is sealed

10:22.189 --> 10:24.155
And my father is better.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.691
Don't you see? I need you here

10:26.693 --> 10:29.194
With me, safe by my side,

10:29.196 --> 10:32.030
While France is in peril,

10:32.032 --> 10:33.298
And whilst we're trying
to have a child.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.301
An heir.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.869
For France, of course.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.139
Stability... For France.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.843
A handy queen consort
for the pleasure

10:44.845 --> 10:47.345
Of the next king... Of France.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.781
I don't just think
of my country's needs.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.183
I think of my wife's needs
as well, but scotland...

10:52.185 --> 10:54.052
...Is one and the same.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.055
My country and I
are one and the same.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.291
Forget that, and you've
forgotten who I am.

11:04.997 --> 11:09.034
How are you... Wife?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.069
Perfect... Husband.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.904
You?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.276
Husband and wife.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.145
A family.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.047
Two families, really.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.882
Who'll have to meet,
at some point,

11:23.884 --> 11:27.152
Since the wedding
was so quick.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.420
Tell me about
your parents.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.222
After breakfast, hmm?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.158
I'm famished.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.127
Julien, let's leave
on our wedding tour

11:36.129 --> 11:37.962
As soon as possible, can we?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.264
Before I really begin to show.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.733
Are you quite sure
it's safe for you to travel?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.135
I thought maybe we ought
to remain here a bit

11:44.137 --> 11:46.104
Till everything's
settled.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.472
What needs to be settled?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.808
I don't know.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.209
Living arrangements,
paperwork...

11:51.211 --> 11:52.477
Your dowry.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.713
My dowry?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.981
Why wait on that?

11:56.983 --> 11:59.284
Because, otherwise,
it could be months of delay.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.186
So what?

12:01.188 --> 12:04.289
We're both rich.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.391
The money will follow us
wherever we settle.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.960
Right.
Of course you're right.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.265
So tell me,

12:14.267 --> 12:17.368
Where would you like
to go on our tour?

12:23.375 --> 12:26.778
I admire your disregard
for others' opinions,

12:26.780 --> 12:29.247
But we have to consider
how this looks.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.316
You've been staying
with me.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.484
People will talk.

12:32.486 --> 12:37.455
You saved me,
nostradamus.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.225
If people want to talk,
let them say that.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.866
Lady kenna.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.805
You distract me so.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.241
What is it, hmm?

13:30.243 --> 13:33.311
Um, perhaps my new ring?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.114
A wedding gift
from my husband.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.115
Your son.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.249
Oh.
Mm.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.318
Penelope:
Oh, it's lovely.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.886
I want it.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.289
Henry.

13:45.424 --> 13:48.893
Henry, I'm your queen.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.328
And it's so cute and tiny.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.465
(clears throat)

13:54.467 --> 13:57.569
A compliment
to your fine tastes.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.238
It's not right.
I won't have it.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.942
(clears throat)

14:05.311 --> 14:07.412
Catherine.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.014
Lady kenna seems
to need a wedding ring.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.015
Pardon?

14:11.017 --> 14:13.084
A ring, catherine.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.254
Here.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.355
Wonderful.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.457
Wear it
in good health.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.368
You shouldn't have
to live like this.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.904
True. But I'd also
like you to live.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.106
I'm too high-spirited
to be a widow.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.374
People will talk.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.343
Please.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.510
You'll only make it worse.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.412
He's moved on now.
Go get some air.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.449
I'm all right.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.086
Keep it.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.122
A token of my sympathy.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.393
Henry is not himself,

14:55.395 --> 14:58.496
And that woman
is making life untenable,

14:58.498 --> 15:00.965
Not only for us
but for all of France.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.367
For France?

15:02.369 --> 15:06.037
The irony is,
if henry knew how close

15:06.039 --> 15:07.438
He was to exposing himself

15:07.440 --> 15:09.040
To his precious
vatican friends...

15:09.042 --> 15:10.441
What are you
talking about?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.944
A plan
to get rid of her.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.046
I need your help
to get rid of penelope.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.181
You mean, to kill her?

15:17.183 --> 15:19.417
I wouldn't come to you
if it were that simple.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.486
Henry would suspect me;
he'd have my head.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.354
I don't need to be part
of any of your schemes.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.622
Oh, you do,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.357
For so many reasons,

15:26.359 --> 15:28.459
But I'll give you one
that will appeal to you.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.597
Help me, and I'll
help you and sebastian--

15:32.599 --> 15:37.302
An estate of your own,
far from french court.

15:37.304 --> 15:42.206
But it's more than just land:
It's a chance for you

15:42.208 --> 15:44.375
And your husband
to live life free

15:44.377 --> 15:46.511
From the constant threat
of henry taking it all away.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.346
But why me?

15:48.348 --> 15:51.149
Would your plan just throw me
back into bed with him?

15:51.151 --> 15:54.152
Not at all.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.688
But it does involve sex.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.057
And rather a mess of it.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.165
(both grunting)

16:13.505 --> 16:15.573
Sorry, I'm a bit spent.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.009
You're hundreds
of miles away.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.345
Scotland, I'm guessing?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.480
Some dire news brought
by mary's brother james?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.482
He's convinced her she's needed
in scotland right away.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.251
From the moment that
I started to fall for her,

16:27.253 --> 16:28.987
This is what I feared most:

16:28.989 --> 16:31.489
That, someday, the needs
of our countries would
tear us apart.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.359
Wouldn't have mattered,
except you married for love.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.028
I wanted to believe
that we could push
past these problems,

16:37.030 --> 16:39.130
Work together.
And can't you?

16:39.132 --> 16:40.999
Mostly, yes. But what happens
when being a good king means

16:41.001 --> 16:42.300
Being a bad husband?

16:42.302 --> 16:45.336
That's simple:
Be a bad king.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.605
That's why she wanted
to marry you, isn't it?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.508
She never wanted to marry me.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.043
She wanted to save your life.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.645
Come on, you're smarter
than that, and so is she.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.514
Mary knew that you could
promise her something

16:56.516 --> 16:59.751
That I never could,
something that I warned
her from the start.

16:59.753 --> 17:03.221
You could put her
first, always.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.523
Isn't that what love is?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.326
To anyone but a king.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.450
Perhaps one of the
original gems was lost

17:32.452 --> 17:34.619
And had to be replaced
with a fake.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.320
Why not mention it
to julien?

17:36.322 --> 17:38.389
He'll probably just have it
repaired for you.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.490
I don't want to stir up
mistrust.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.625
It seems like mistrust

17:40.627 --> 17:42.560
Is already stirred up.
What happened?

17:42.562 --> 17:45.396
Whenever I mention
meeting his parents

17:45.398 --> 17:47.732
Or going to hungary
on our wedding tour,
he changes the subject.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.234
Plenty of people would like
to hide their parents.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.602
Me, for instance.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.406
It's also the subjects
he does seem keen on...

17:55.408 --> 17:56.541
Like my dowry.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.444
Well, it is a large sum.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.779
For a rich man
with a castle in hungary,

18:01.781 --> 18:04.148
He seems awfully impatient
to have it in hand.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.650
What did your family tell you
about him?

18:05.652 --> 18:07.218
Just that he was

18:07.220 --> 18:10.421
A very wealthy hungarian
who married two rich women.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.624
Both wives died,
making him sad, but even richer.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.660
And there was nothing suspect
about his finances?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.528
He gambled a bit,
but all men do.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.197
Besides, you can't gamble
away wealth like his.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.499
My brother came awfully close.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.568
Talk to julien.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.670
You've both been so open
till now.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.505
Well, yes and no.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.108
When I told him I was pregnant
but wouldn't say

18:30.110 --> 18:32.610
Who the father was,
he said he wouldn't ask

18:32.612 --> 18:34.879
About my past mistakes
if I didn't ask about his.

18:34.881 --> 18:39.517
I'm sure he meant nothing more
than the usual male adventuring.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.819
You wed quickly is all.
It's nerves, lola.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.688
I'm sure of it.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.560
Trinidad?

18:49.562 --> 18:50.895
Really?

18:50.897 --> 18:52.196
That seems awfully far.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.632
Far from everything.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.601
Olivia wants to find
a new life with me.

18:56.603 --> 19:00.605
You'd be taking her from all
the comforts of court.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.274
She's been through so much here.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.375
We both have.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.843
The years have been long
and dark.

19:05.845 --> 19:11.516
I'm thankful for the time
I spent as your adviser,

19:11.518 --> 19:13.651
But I-I want to give her
a new start.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.320
You're trying to save her.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.756
You've seen danger here.

19:18.758 --> 19:23.261
My old friend,
how can I say this?

19:24.530 --> 19:26.397
I can't let you leave.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.834
Your gift of sight
is invaluable to me,

19:29.836 --> 19:31.669
To the safety of France.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.439
You can force me to stay...

19:38.377 --> 19:40.511
...But not to see.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.812
You'll have me,
but not my visions.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.215
Not if you cost me this
last chance at happiness.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.717
So you came to me
as if I had a choice,

19:46.719 --> 19:48.653
But clearly I don't.
You have choices.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.655
And none will get
you what you want from me.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.756
I could take your life.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.724
This is not a betrayal.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.562
This is a friend
saying good-bye.

20:00.599 --> 20:03.834
I suppose I'll have
to wish you luck, then.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.803
You'll need it, you know.

20:05.805 --> 20:10.508
If you think you're safe in
the new world, you're wrong.

20:10.510 --> 20:14.445
The land is soft and sweet,
but filled with vipers.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.983
(door opens)

20:21.253 --> 20:22.753
I've been thinking,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.855
And I want to take you
to scotland with me.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.692
Yes, I know, you told me that.
But when?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.227
Next month?

20:29.229 --> 20:31.696
Next year?
Now.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.298
As soon as we can.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.701
It will need to be brief,

20:36.703 --> 20:39.303
And I'll need
to finish my deal
with the cardinal

20:39.305 --> 20:41.772
Before we leave,
and make sure

20:41.774 --> 20:43.841
That my mother can
handle my father.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.577
It won't be easy,
may take a day or two.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.778
You're serious.

20:49.548 --> 20:52.450
But what if we can't seal
the deal with the vatican?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.385
What if your father gets worse?
What...?

20:54.387 --> 20:57.288
What if my wife
doesn't realize
that I love her?

20:57.290 --> 21:00.625
What if she doesn't see
that I've put her first?

21:00.627 --> 21:03.461
Francis, thank you.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.831
I promise you'll be glad
we went.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.500
When scotland is stronger,
France will be stronger, too.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.035
Well, start packing.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.670
And tell your brother

21:12.672 --> 21:14.639
That scotland will
soon greet her queen

21:14.641 --> 21:16.474
And her king.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.047
Both of you?
Really?

21:23.049 --> 21:25.549
I thought you'd be pleased.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.551
You wanted a queen
for scotland to bow to,

21:27.553 --> 21:29.720
And now you're getting more:
A queen and a king.

21:29.722 --> 21:30.788
A french king.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.023
My king.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.758
Scotland's king.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.726
Who arrives with
french soldiers,

21:35.728 --> 21:37.361
Who even has "France"
in his name.

21:37.363 --> 21:38.596
James, this is silly.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.398
Francis is strong

21:40.400 --> 21:42.700
And he's devoted to me
and to scotland.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.769
When scotland sees
that with her own eyes,

21:44.771 --> 21:46.370
The crown will be stronger

21:46.372 --> 21:47.705
And so will
my mother's position.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.674
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

21:49.676 --> 21:51.342
Of course.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.577
I apologize.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.746
I worry too much.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.982
Scotland will
celebrate her queen,

21:57.984 --> 22:01.619
Even if she arrives
with some fair-haired
french baggage.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.088
(laughs)
how soon can
you leave?

22:04.090 --> 22:05.856
Uh, francis has some
business to attend to,

22:05.858 --> 22:07.058
And then we'll leave.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.761
I'll make arrangements
immediately.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.100
You seem worried,
my darling.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.702
Are you having doubts?

22:17.704 --> 22:18.703
No.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.538
I'm eager to go.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.073
I've considered it
for some time.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.708
I've made mistakes.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.743
I've misread prophecies

22:25.745 --> 22:28.079
And shared others where
I probably shouldn't have.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.513
Sooner or later,

22:29.515 --> 22:31.782
The truth will
catch up to me.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.884
Leaving is
the right thing,

22:33.886 --> 22:35.019
For both of us.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.521
I want you to know,

22:37.523 --> 22:39.657
Whatever happens,

22:39.659 --> 22:41.359
You've already...

22:41.361 --> 22:42.460
Olivia!

22:42.894 --> 22:43.627
Oh!

22:50.902 --> 22:52.970
Beware of vipers.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.040
She's beautiful,

22:56.042 --> 22:57.775
But damnably willful
and headstrong.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.643
And there's
something not right

22:59.645 --> 23:01.879
About someone else
telling me who to
spend my life with.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.614
Not to mention she's
been with a member
of my own family.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.882
Uh, forgive my
lack of compassion,

23:04.884 --> 23:06.584
But I'm not sure whether
you're bemoaning

23:06.586 --> 23:07.785
Your situation with kenna
or mine with mary.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.953
(laughter in distance)

23:11.823 --> 23:13.891
(coins clinking)

23:13.893 --> 23:16.660
(indistinct conversation)

23:16.662 --> 23:18.596
Francis:
That was mimi natalia,
wasn't it?

23:18.598 --> 23:19.897
Bash:
Mary's brother's footman

23:19.899 --> 23:22.833
Has expensive tastes
in courtesans.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.870
Suspiciously
expensive, I think.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.975
Hmm...

23:32.144 --> 23:33.878
It needs more.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.780
More?

23:35.782 --> 23:37.114
Penelope:
More red.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.517
More lace.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.052
To keep the king's eyes
from wandering

23:42.054 --> 23:44.155
To, uh, sad
old habits.

23:44.157 --> 23:45.823
Yes, your grace.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.626
What do you want?

23:48.628 --> 23:51.061
Did you come here for
this miserable little ring?

23:51.063 --> 23:53.531
Not at all.
You can keep it.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.965
I actually came here to help.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.066
(scoffs)

23:56.068 --> 23:57.501
I find that hard to believe.

23:57.503 --> 23:58.969
Have you noticed that the queen

23:58.971 --> 24:00.438
Makes no effort
to have you removed?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.507
She tried and she failed.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.009
She's an artist with poisons.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.577
If she wanted you dead,

24:06.579 --> 24:08.078
You'd be
rotting by now.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.880
No, you're alive
because you serve

24:09.882 --> 24:11.882
A purpose: You keep our poor
mad king distracted.

24:11.884 --> 24:15.019
He is unwell, yes.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.021
I try to divert him
from his pain.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.722
Well, you used
to divert him.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.524
Until his mind wandered back

24:20.526 --> 24:22.726
To "sad old habits,"

24:22.728 --> 24:24.728
Like me.
You won't get him back,

24:24.730 --> 24:25.963
If that's what you're thinking.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.465
I don't want henry back.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.099
I've seen what he does
to playthings,

24:29.101 --> 24:30.935
Once they start to bore him,
and it's not pretty.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.037
What's your point?

24:33.039 --> 24:35.940
If you want to keep
the king's interest

24:35.942 --> 24:38.742
And survive
by his side...

24:38.744 --> 24:41.946
Then again,
if you're unconcerned...

24:42.914 --> 24:44.181
I'm listening.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.221
Have you tried
blindfolds?

24:50.223 --> 24:51.956
Having him listen to
the sound of your voice?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.958
His grace would
follow me anywhere.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.026
Hot wax on his chest?
Just his chest?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.828
(laughs)

24:57.830 --> 24:58.929
No wonder he tired of you.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.698
The standing cross?

25:03.835 --> 25:06.670
All I did was pay
for the lady's services.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.506
Since when is that a crime?

25:08.508 --> 25:09.740
It's rather how much you paid,

25:09.742 --> 25:11.008
And how you could afford it.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.011
I told you, in thanks
for a decade's service.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.714
Service to my wife's brother,
the earl of moray.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.883
But he's a scot,
and you're a scot

25:18.885 --> 25:22.219
And there's...
<i>A</i> queen mary on this coin,

25:22.221 --> 25:23.888
But not <i>my</i>
<i>queen mary.</i>

25:23.890 --> 25:25.289
That gold isn't mine.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.858
You're lying.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.760
Not a good start.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.999
My men found this gold
in your room,

25:35.001 --> 25:36.200
Stitched into your valise.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.868
Would you care to explain to me

25:37.870 --> 25:40.170
Why you're carrying
english gold?

25:40.172 --> 25:41.839
I don't know what you mean.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.607
Where were you going
when my men caught you

25:43.609 --> 25:45.009
Ducking out of the castle?

25:45.011 --> 25:46.310
Meeting the person
who paid you this gold?

25:46.312 --> 25:47.745
An englishman?

25:47.747 --> 25:49.113
An enemy of my wife's?

25:49.115 --> 25:50.180
No.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.782
I-I'm not from these parts.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.752
I just wanted
to see the village.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.323
Fetch the torturer

25:59.325 --> 26:01.892
And tell him that we
may have a job for him.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.195
I don't want to hurt you,
but trust me...

26:08.133 --> 26:09.233
...They do.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.978
He admitted to having enough
gold to pay for a courtesan,

26:20.980 --> 26:23.247
But denied that
the gold hidden in
his own bag was his.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.616
He's lying; he has to be.

26:25.618 --> 26:26.684
There are plenty of
ways for a scotsman

26:26.686 --> 26:27.952
To get ahold
of english gold.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.887
We still trade
with the english.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.288
Then why so much of it,

26:31.290 --> 26:32.723
And why lie
about it?

26:32.725 --> 26:33.857
Leave us.

26:35.026 --> 26:37.661
This is my
brother's footman

26:37.663 --> 26:38.896
You are torturing.
Questioning.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.064
For now. Which is why

26:40.066 --> 26:41.699
I came
straight to you.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.067
Mary, does none of this
trouble you?

26:43.069 --> 26:45.069
I trust my brother.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.705
This footman could be
a protestant scottish rebel,

26:47.707 --> 26:49.740
Or work for
the english, or both.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.275
And whether james knows
what his own man

26:51.277 --> 26:53.043
Is up to or not,
you aren't safe.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.178
James will keep me safe.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.146
Are you so sure?

26:56.148 --> 26:57.214
James is a protestant...

26:59.184 --> 27:00.384
He hates the french.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.286
And many want to see
him rule scotland.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.089
Only one claim to power
is stronger than his,

27:05.091 --> 27:08.058
And that's yours.
If his claim is so strong,

27:08.060 --> 27:10.060
Then why doesn't he topple
my mother without warning me?

27:10.062 --> 27:12.096
Why bring me back to make his
task that much more difficult?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.365
You're assuming he wanted
to see you home safely.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.034
Accidents happen
at sea all the time.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.969
Then I will ask james
about this.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.638
And what if he's
a part of it?

27:20.640 --> 27:22.673
He'll lie and you'll
learn nothing from it.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.274
Mary, don't you need to know
how much you can trust

27:24.276 --> 27:26.010
Your own brother?

27:26.012 --> 27:28.646
For the sake of your mother
and for scotland,

27:28.648 --> 27:30.914
Give me a little time
to find you some answers.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.282
I want to take you to scotland,

27:32.284 --> 27:34.084
But not if I'm leading us
both into danger.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.987
Do it quickly.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.355
There's a storm coming.
We need to leave soon.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.358
(grunts)

27:48.933 --> 27:50.334
Wait.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.303
I don't know about this.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.105
What's wrong?
Is the platform unsteady?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.206
It's not that.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.675
It doesn't feel right.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.410
Exactly.

27:59.412 --> 28:01.278
It's wrong.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.114
You're a wicked old king,

28:04.116 --> 28:06.116
And you need to be cleansed
of your sins.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.923
Please.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.191
Take me down.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.959
Kenna said you would beg.

28:15.961 --> 28:19.096
Oh, dear kenna.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.198
(sighs)
how I miss her kind face.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.834
Shut up.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.837
(pounding at door)

28:27.439 --> 28:29.039
Henry, I'm sorry.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.207
I tried
to make him wait.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.743
But the rumors...

28:32.745 --> 28:35.713
The bishop insisted
on seeing you.
Bishop?!

28:35.715 --> 28:37.281
Don't you remember?

28:37.283 --> 28:40.117
This is bishop renauld,
from provence.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.252
He came with the cardinal,
the pope's delegation.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.287
Renauld:
Your grace.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.189
I-I cannot look.
This is,

28:45.191 --> 28:47.424
Is blasphemy.
Then close your eyes,

28:47.426 --> 28:49.226
You pious fool.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.495
I will,
but what of god?

28:54.099 --> 28:55.733
Oh, don't bring...

28:55.735 --> 28:57.167
Don't bring him into this.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.470
But he is here...

28:59.472 --> 29:01.438
He is everywhere; he sees

29:01.440 --> 29:04.241
This mockery!

29:04.243 --> 29:06.977
If you turn from him...

29:06.979 --> 29:08.178
What if

29:08.180 --> 29:11.281
He turns from you?

29:11.283 --> 29:13.016
But would he?

29:13.018 --> 29:14.818
It is god's will
that puts you here.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.153
It is god's will

29:16.155 --> 29:17.387
That gives you your armies,

29:17.389 --> 29:20.290
Your gold, your crown.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.359
He only provides for those

29:22.361 --> 29:24.762
Who are worthy
and righteous.

29:24.764 --> 29:25.863
I see no righteousness here.

29:25.865 --> 29:26.897
Henry, end this now.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.832
Send this witch away,

29:28.834 --> 29:30.834
Before her wickedness
curses us all...
Wait!

29:30.836 --> 29:32.903
They're in it together!
Don't you see?

29:32.905 --> 29:34.872
Leave, penelope.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.340
Kenna and the queen...

29:36.342 --> 29:37.775
Henry, they've got you twisted

29:37.777 --> 29:39.543
In knots!
It is you

29:39.545 --> 29:43.013
Who have bound
and twisted me.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.249
Get out.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.050
What?
Now!

29:47.052 --> 29:48.886
Come, child.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.420
While the king feels forgiving.
Henry, no!

29:50.422 --> 29:52.089
Come.
Get off me!

29:52.091 --> 29:55.225
Henry, you poor thing.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.227
Oh, look at you.
It all seemed so...

29:57.229 --> 29:59.329
So harmless.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.099
Oh, catherine...

30:02.101 --> 30:04.168
Catherine, I am lost.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.904
I need god's support.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.406
Absolutely.

30:11.276 --> 30:13.944
(thunder rumbles)

30:21.186 --> 30:23.520
Wait. Where are
your things?

30:23.522 --> 30:25.989
I watched you pack.
Where is the...?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.958
I can't go with you.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.126
What?

30:29.128 --> 30:30.828
I don't...

30:34.465 --> 30:36.133
You mean to send me off
without you?

30:36.135 --> 30:37.401
What's changed?

30:37.403 --> 30:39.269
Why would
you do this?

30:39.271 --> 30:41.405
My gift, it's truly a curse.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.974
I can't escape its burdens,
however far I run.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.310
But you can.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.978
And you must.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.013
No.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.082
I won't
leave you.
You will.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.550
I've seen it, olivia.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.552
I've seen you happy

30:55.554 --> 30:57.921
With someone else.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.089
You're lying.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.425
The vision that
changed your mind,

31:01.427 --> 31:03.026
We both saw it,
didn't we?

31:03.028 --> 31:05.062
That snake was a message
from catherine.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.231
She considers me a weapon

31:07.233 --> 31:08.866
She doesn't want to lose.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.334
She will punish me
for defying her.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.568
She will kill you.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.036
That is the cost
of my leaving:

31:13.038 --> 31:14.504
Your life.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.040
That is her message.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.508
But if we were far away...

31:18.510 --> 31:20.477
There is no escaping her reach.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.212
And what if I stayed?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.348
And be shackled to a man

31:24.350 --> 31:26.049
Enslaved to a wicked queen?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.118
Oh, that is no
life for you.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.486
That is barely
a life for me.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.989
Be free of this place

31:31.991 --> 31:34.124
That has caused you
so much pain.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.560
Be free of me.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.196
(thunder rumbling)

31:40.398 --> 31:42.499
Pardon. Time to go.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.668
Weather's turning.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.036
No, no.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.037
My cousins...

31:47.039 --> 31:48.538
Will look after you.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.573
I've sent them word.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.208
Start a new life.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.314
And be happy.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.588
(thunder rumbling)

32:08.026 --> 32:10.227
(thunder rumbling,
bell ringing in distance)

32:29.514 --> 32:32.716
A letter of credit
has come from your father

32:32.718 --> 32:34.351
To the bank where I work.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.153
With your word, I'll sign it,

32:36.155 --> 32:38.188
And your dowry will be moved
to your husband's accounts.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.157
Just my word?

32:40.159 --> 32:41.658
It's your father's request.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.060
The money is not
yours, of course.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.029
Women cannot hold
such accounts.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.698
Yes.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.533
Heaven knows
what foolish things

32:49.535 --> 32:51.068
Women might do
with our own money.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.170
Gamble, buy prostitutes...

32:53.172 --> 32:54.171
I beg your pardon?

32:54.173 --> 32:56.707
What if I wait?

32:56.709 --> 32:59.343
Does the money stay safe
in my father's accounts?

32:59.345 --> 33:01.745
Of course; but safe from what?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.180
Nothing.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.148
Hopefully.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.050
I'll send word when I'm ready.

33:07.052 --> 33:09.119
Good day.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.289
(knocking on door)

33:14.726 --> 33:16.493
Forgive me, mary.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.061
Would've requested
an audience,

33:18.063 --> 33:19.429
But I seem to have
misplaced my footman.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.164
Is something wrong?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.300
The storm is blowing in
faster than I thought.
Yes.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.602
I did notice
the sky was darkening.
Not that storm.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.337
You've heard of the lords
of the congregation?

33:27.339 --> 33:30.507
Those tiresome
protestant malcontents?

33:30.509 --> 33:32.476
Tiresome until they
agree on something.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.311
They've voted to
start a rebellion.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.413
A blockade will
provoke a battle

33:36.415 --> 33:38.215
With catholic authorities,

33:38.217 --> 33:40.784
And then they intend to
remove your mother by force.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.352
You couldn't have
missed the weight

33:42.354 --> 33:43.754
Of the gold in your valise.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.155
You are guilty

33:45.157 --> 33:46.423
Or covering
for someone who is.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.125
Is it james?

33:48.127 --> 33:50.660
Shall I question your master?

33:53.331 --> 33:55.165
Fetch me his master,
the earl.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.200
Take two dozen guards,
and prepare for a fight.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.136
You may kill if needs be.
No.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.204
It's, it's not his gold.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.606
Who paid you then?

34:02.608 --> 34:04.341
An englishman?

34:06.077 --> 34:09.379
Very well.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.115
(screaming)

34:12.117 --> 34:14.251
Where did you hear about this?
From your own envoy.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.186
You can ask him yourself.
Well, what can we do?

34:16.188 --> 34:18.121
Come home to scotland.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.122
Leave now.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.557
But francis, he's not ready yet.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.125
Leave without him.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.193
Let him catch up.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.262
He'll only be days behind us.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.164
(grunting)

34:30.134 --> 34:32.235
Do you know what this gold
tells me that you won't?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.071
You're brave.

34:34.073 --> 34:35.439
But your loyalty has a price.

34:35.441 --> 34:38.141
You sold it once,
why not sell it again?

34:38.143 --> 34:40.210
Will you talk
if I promised you your freedom,

34:40.212 --> 34:43.313
Plus three times
the gold you were paid?

34:45.249 --> 34:46.283
Five times.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.420
And a prince's oath

34:50.422 --> 34:52.355
That I will let you live.

34:54.625 --> 34:57.194
Mary, I'm sorry to be so plain.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.495
But you never knew
our father as I did.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.464
You never knew what
he dreamed for you.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.332
For your time on his throne.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.568
I can't risk this marriage,
this alliance,

35:04.570 --> 35:06.570
For a dead man's dreams,
even my father's.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.205
Can you risk it
for scotland?

35:08.207 --> 35:10.540
Would you rather be the queen
you were born to be

35:10.542 --> 35:12.442
Or a pawn of the french court?

35:17.248 --> 35:19.382
Finish packing my things.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.851
Only enough for two weeks.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.319
Francis can bring
the rest, if he follows.

35:22.321 --> 35:23.753
I'm leaving for scotland.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.255
Today.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.690
Francis: <i>Ten times the gold</i>
<i>you were paid.</i>

35:26.692 --> 35:29.259
And you can buy
all the courtesans you want.

35:29.261 --> 35:32.596
And you swear
I'll be spared?

35:32.598 --> 35:34.698
I'll be set free?

35:34.700 --> 35:36.233
If I believe your story,
you'll be placed

35:36.235 --> 35:38.869
On the ship of your choosing,
by my men.

35:38.871 --> 35:42.372
And what happens to you
after that is up to you.

35:44.509 --> 35:48.512
I was paid to murder the queen
of scots on her voyage home.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.514
Who paid you?
Englishmen.

35:50.516 --> 35:54.451
I didn't know them, but
I heard them talking.

35:54.453 --> 35:57.420
They want james to
be scotland's king.

36:14.805 --> 36:16.640
Married less than a week,

36:16.642 --> 36:17.807
And you've already
tired of me?

36:17.809 --> 36:20.343
I don't feel well is all.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.378
I-is it the baby?

36:21.380 --> 36:22.846
No, I...

36:22.848 --> 36:24.648
I think it's just nerves.

36:24.650 --> 36:28.318
There's... (sighs)
so much uncertainty.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.621
The baby, my future...

36:31.623 --> 36:33.857
My husband...

36:33.859 --> 36:36.359
You're uncertain about me?

36:36.361 --> 36:38.728
I fear we don't know
each other well.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.265
Is there anything
weighing on you?

36:42.267 --> 36:44.501
Any troubles of yours

36:44.503 --> 36:46.970
A wife might share?

36:50.374 --> 36:52.842
I-I'm sure, in time,

36:52.844 --> 36:55.212
We'll share everything.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.847
You may even tell me
who fathered your baby.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.584
Our baby.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.286
Or I may never ask.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.422
Because it may not matter.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.458
What matters is how we feel
about one another.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.560
And I feel love for you.

37:10.562 --> 37:14.364
I know it all happened
very quickly, but

37:14.366 --> 37:15.899
That's where we are.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.300
Together.

37:17.302 --> 37:19.002
With our secrets.
With our pasts.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.305
I swear, if I believed knowing
every single thing

37:22.307 --> 37:24.674
About one another could protect
us from future troubles,

37:24.676 --> 37:26.443
I would tell you every moment

37:26.445 --> 37:28.511
Of my past.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.513
But...

37:30.515 --> 37:31.982
My life...

37:31.984 --> 37:35.752
This... Wonderful life,

37:35.754 --> 37:40.023
Began the day you agreed
to be my bride.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.792
Then why do I feel afraid?

37:42.794 --> 37:45.862
Because life is
full of uncertainty.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.531
(quiet laugh)
that's why we love.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.934
To face it with someone.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.436
Together.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.006
Let's face life
together, lola.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.508
You and me.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.943
Can we?

38:02.613 --> 38:04.447
My father believed that actor

38:04.449 --> 38:06.449
Was part of the
vatican delegation.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.351
You did it.

38:08.353 --> 38:09.719
And now you're saying
we're rich?

38:09.721 --> 38:11.955
Well, richer than we were.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.291
That estate that henry
promised penelope

38:14.293 --> 38:15.792
Belonged to catherine;
she's given it to us.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.295
She also let me keep her ring.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.063
Well, you have
everything you wanted:

38:20.065 --> 38:22.399
Land, money, jewelry...

38:22.401 --> 38:23.933
Practically everything.

38:27.505 --> 38:31.041
I was able to get
this back as well.

38:31.043 --> 38:33.910
Penelope looked so pathetic,
back in the kitchen.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.478
Yet still, I couldn't resist.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.647
Should I buy you a new ring,

38:37.649 --> 38:38.815
Now that we can afford it?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.550
No, you fool,
you gave it to me.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.888
Such a queer feeling,
whenever I look at it.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.656
What's that?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.725
A sort of certainty.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.461
One I've never felt before.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.762
Someone's always
going to be looking

38:52.764 --> 38:54.631
Out for me now,
no matter what.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.067
I'm not sure you need
looking out for.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.402
Well...

38:59.404 --> 39:01.404
I'm stuck with him, aren't I?

39:01.406 --> 39:04.107
Might as well put him
to some kind of use.

39:13.984 --> 39:16.553
Leave...

39:16.555 --> 39:18.521
Me alone.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.056
Get...

39:20.058 --> 39:22.592
Out.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.027
Please!

39:24.029 --> 39:25.829
Go.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.902
Will my sins never leave me?

39:32.904 --> 39:34.471
Did the footman tell you

39:34.473 --> 39:35.505
That james was involved
with the plot?

39:35.507 --> 39:36.840
No, but can you take
that chance?

39:36.842 --> 39:38.842
I take that chance every day.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.044
The english are constantly
plotting against me.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.612
If they want
a protestant king in scotland,

39:42.614 --> 39:43.546
Of course
they would choose james.

39:43.548 --> 39:44.748
But do you really think

39:44.750 --> 39:46.516
That he had no inkling of this?

39:46.518 --> 39:48.551
His own man in the pay
of your enemies?

39:48.553 --> 39:51.588
James has written to me
of dozens of plots against me.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.757
Plots that were
to his benefit.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.892
He tells me because he wants
what is best for scotland.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.460
As he knows I do.

39:57.462 --> 39:59.462
Mary, please, we will go later,

39:59.464 --> 40:00.563
When it is safe.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.499
My mother is in jeopardy now.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.868
Scotland is in jeopardy now.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.469
I said we'll go when it's safe.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.804
We will never be safe.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.639
I know that you're afraid

40:09.641 --> 40:11.908
This is a trap.
I am, too.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.877
But I need to take this chance.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.780
I have to.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.948
I will be home soon.

40:18.950 --> 40:22.519
Please trust me.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.921
(quietly):
I can't.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.556
Guards! Surround the queen.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.059
What are you doing?

40:31.495 --> 40:33.963
(thunder rumbling)

40:33.965 --> 40:35.765
Locked in the tower?

40:35.767 --> 40:38.601
Did you think that I would
try to slink out of my rooms,

40:38.603 --> 40:39.969
Like a rat in a passageway?

40:39.971 --> 40:40.970
Not like a rat.

40:40.972 --> 40:43.440
Like a defiant queen.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.508
You will be released as soon
as your brother has cast off.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.177
I told him that we'd follow
as soon as we could.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.813
So, you lied?
It is not a lie.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.482
When I know
that it is safe to...
It will be too late!

40:52.484 --> 40:55.552
We both know
that day will never come.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.986
I will not help you
with the cardinal,

40:56.988 --> 40:58.688
If that's what you think.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.523
I know.

41:00.525 --> 41:01.858
My mother and I will

41:01.860 --> 41:04.160
Do what we have to;
we'll find a way.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.728
You may hate me
right now,

41:05.730 --> 41:08.698
But I have done this for you.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.900
I love you,
and I've put you first.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.536
You love a <i>girl!</i>

41:13.538 --> 41:16.573
You don't love a queen
or you would allow me to be one!

41:16.575 --> 41:18.608
You are putting yourself
and your country first,

41:18.610 --> 41:20.777
Just as you always have!
That is not true.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.613
If scotland falls,
I will never forgive you!

41:23.615 --> 41:26.115
You will lose my country,
and you will lose me!

41:26.117 --> 41:29.085
I warned you, francis--
we are one and the same.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.553
Scotland won't fall.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.555
And neither will we.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.691
I can't hear another word.
Get out!

41:36.727 --> 41:40.029
I'll be back when you've
had a chance to calm down.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.732
Francis...

41:42.734 --> 41:44.767
You can't just leave me
locked in here-- francis!

41:46.737 --> 41:49.072
(echoing):
Francis! Francis! Francis!
