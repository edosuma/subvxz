[cell door slams]

01:19.371 --> 01:22.374
Now, you'll want to pick
the gayest handkerchief you can find,

01:22.457 --> 01:24.668
since this will serve as your doll's head.

01:24.752 --> 01:29.089
Uh, I'll choose apple-blossom pink
for my demonstration.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.843
I'm gonna give my doll bangs
like Debbie Reynolds.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.387
My mom says
I can't watch her movies anymore,

01:35.470 --> 01:38.598
now that she gave her lady gift
to Eddie Fisher.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.309
-What does that mean?
-It's some kind of flower.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.146
This may not look as tricky
as the Indian Lore badge

01:44.229 --> 01:45.648
or the Backyard Chef badge,

01:45.731 --> 01:49.860
but the Hobby Fun badge
has eluded many a sloppy girl.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.154
Did you hear that, Frieda?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.657
Finally a badge you won't get.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.366
You calling me sloppy?

01:56.449 --> 01:58.744
-And smelly. Also smelly.
-[chuckles]

01:58.827 --> 02:00.412
It's the beaver musk
I put around my neck.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.580
Well, it smells like a monkey butt.

02:02.665 --> 02:03.707
[Susan chuckles]

02:03.791 --> 02:06.209
Technically, it does come
from the anal glands,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.836
which makes it very helpful
when you want to attract deer.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.007
"Attract deer"?
Are you gonna marry them?

02:12.090 --> 02:13.466
I'm gonna shoot 'em.

02:14.718 --> 02:18.055
[whispering] You were right.
She is an alien from outer space.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.350
Do you know the Nature Scout motto?

02:22.434 --> 02:24.477
"Ready for any and all things."

02:24.561 --> 02:26.104
Do you know what it means?

02:26.188 --> 02:29.942
What if your mom went away one day
and there were no more finger sandwiches?

02:30.025 --> 02:33.278
What if the sky went dark
and all the crops died?

02:33.361 --> 02:35.613
Would you know
which plants were safe to eat

02:35.698 --> 02:37.324
and which ones will make you vomit
till you're dead?

02:37.407 --> 02:41.578
Could you kill an animal and clean it
without cutting the intestines?

02:41.662 --> 02:46.041
Could you take its skin
and salt it and tan it to keep warm?

02:46.959 --> 02:51.880
Or would you sit in the corner
with your doll and wait to die?

02:51.964 --> 02:53.048
[girls gasping]

02:53.966 --> 02:56.885
I'll take a piece of that green gingham
over there, thank you.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.748
Uh, hello? Hello?

03:25.831 --> 03:27.665
-Anybody there?
-Maybe it's broken.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.128
Hey, uh, if you're a guard,
buzz twice.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.295
[silence]

03:33.756 --> 03:35.007
-Not a good sign.
-[sighs]

03:35.090 --> 03:37.009
The one who kicked me in the vag
is kinda cute.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.886
Good Aryan stock.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.430
[Sankey] You can't tell by looking.
I met a Jew once, nose like a Kewpie doll.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.267
And the crotch kicker's mine.
You get the bald one.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.601
But I called him.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.022
Hair likes hair, bald likes bald.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.399
Why do you think Cali skins
don't fuck Idaho Klan?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.401
-No mixing.
-[Helen] Both.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.569
What?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.739
All for Helen.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.657
[Frieda] News flash, ladies.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.826
Those boys don't wanna fuck any of you.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.953
They don't see you as women.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.289
-[Brandy] Look, the garden gnome talks.
-[Sankey laughing]

04:08.081 --> 04:09.792
-The fuck are you doing, anyway?
-[Frieda sawing]

04:12.585 --> 04:13.879
Craft project.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.841
[Sankey] What a weirdo.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.014
[grunts]

04:24.097 --> 04:25.182
They look kinda dumb.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.642
I like someone
I can have a conversation with.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.103
Oh, wait, are we talking sex
or relationship here?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.646
Fuck, marry, kill.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.106
[Brandy] There's only two of them.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.150
Three of us.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.694
It'll pass the time.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.571
Hey, Einstein.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.866
-He knows his name.
-[all chuckle]

04:42.950 --> 04:44.284
Wanna play a game?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.331
[dial tone]

04:49.414 --> 04:50.874
[grunting]

05:01.593 --> 05:03.136
[breathing heavily]

05:05.973 --> 05:07.432
-Oh, sh--
-Shit, you scared me.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.810
No, you scared me
with that performance back there.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.145
You should win an Oscar
and use it like a dildo.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.897
Sorry, I just had to clear my head.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.482
You got that gun on you?

05:16.817 --> 05:20.487
Yeah, it's in my underwear drawer.
What you think? [scoffs]

05:20.570 --> 05:23.698
Go collect the guards from the bubble.
Bring 'em to the chapel.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.908
Get Flaritza to help you, all right?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.868
-Flaritza?
-Yeah, that's their thing now.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.912
I'll see you in the chapel in ten minutes.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.455
We gonna get organized.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.624
[Dayanara sighs]

05:34.877 --> 05:36.253
You need to bow out?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.131
This is your chance,
right here, right now.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.134
All you gotta do is hand over the piece.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.469
Nah, I got this.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.514
Good.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.267
-No more <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> shit, okay?
-Wait, what does that mean?

05:50.350 --> 05:53.811
-Like, letting people interrupt me?
-Nah, it's, like, the whitest movie ever.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.189
Just don't act
like a <i>gringa</i> mental case, okay?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.612
I thought you said
this shit was clickbait.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.907
Be patient.
All it takes is one retweet.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.076
We was supposed to be
"Hamster With a Burrito."

06:08.160 --> 06:10.913
-Instead, we nothin' but Side Boob.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.331
Hey, "Workers in the Mine"
has over 1,100 views.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.875
[chuckles] Yeah? Well, how many of those
was from your mama?

06:15.959 --> 06:18.921
[laughs] Ooh, ya burnt!

06:19.004 --> 06:20.630
-That'll do it.
-[door opens]

06:23.133 --> 06:24.634
State your business.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.137
Oh, shit, they got <i>Jefe.</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:28.430
They don't "got" me.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.932
Kinda looks that way.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.309
Business?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.769
Ruiz is havin' a little orientation
in the chapel.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.521
A reorientation.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.981
-Pass.
-[Janae] Yeah.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.900
Where I come from, you don't hang
with bitches packin' caliber.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.777
That guard only took one bullet.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.321
Too many left.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.448
Yeah, we keepin' this here
a no-violence zone.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.326
[sniffles]

06:50.285 --> 06:52.079
A no-gun zone.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.664
We cool with Spam cans in socks.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.748
Hey, your call.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.793
Look, we was just tryin' to have
a racially inclusive riot and shit.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.003
Wait, a guard was shot?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.214
[clicks tongue] Yeah,
but he ain't dead or nothin'.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.632
-Yeah--
-[Taystee] Yo, we got a comment, y'all.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.634
[Janae laughs] Yo, here come a revolution!

07:07.552 --> 07:11.889
Hold up.
"Earn up to $1,200 a week from home."

07:12.807 --> 07:15.393
[chuckles] Looks like the spam
escaped your socks.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.188
Wait, you can make
that kinda money from home?

07:19.897 --> 07:23.860
So I'm asking you to poke your head in.
See who's takin' charge.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.321
It's just a meeting.
I'm sure it'll be civilized.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.864
[inmates hooting and yelling]

07:32.369 --> 07:34.621
Well, that does not seem very PC.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.999
Or is it allowed
if you're darker than a Band-Aid?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.208
[grunts and sighs]

07:38.291 --> 07:40.835
I'm not ready to be around people yet.
[chuckles nervously]

07:40.918 --> 07:42.837
And maybe that includes you.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.464
You should go.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.924
-I'm not in uniform.
-[groans]

07:47.009 --> 07:48.843
And you're nice and anonymous.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.553
[sighs] Anonymous?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.639
There are, like,
four Asian girls in this prison

07:52.722 --> 07:54.349
and my girlfriend just died.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.684
-[breathing heavily]
-Oh, so let them comfort you, then.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.311
Well, I can't go out there.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.437
When there's a revolution,

07:59.521 --> 08:02.524
who do you think it is
that gets guillotined first?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.109
-The one percent.
-Marie-Antoinette.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.568
-The one percent.
-That's right.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.737
And I intend to keep
this one-percent neck.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.822
I had it contoured last January

08:09.906 --> 08:13.743
after Colicchio told me
that it had more rings than a Swiss roll.

08:13.826 --> 08:17.122
But I told him
he looked like a manscaped scrotum,

08:17.205 --> 08:20.792
which is less poetic,
but extremely apt.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.003
[sighs]

08:24.004 --> 08:25.088
You're scared.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.590
That's a new shade from you.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.135
-"Darker than a Band-Aid."
-Oh, darling... [chuckles]

08:30.218 --> 08:34.639
-I have been terrified this whole time.
-Bullshit.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.100
You have had this place
wrapped around your finger,

08:37.183 --> 08:39.019
but now you just lost your protectors.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.188
So I'm in the market for replacements.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.649
Look, I wasn't supposed
to be here anymore.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.277
All right?
I was supposed to be out.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.611
[sighs]

08:53.700 --> 08:56.036
[exhales heavily] Hmm.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.664
-The books...
-Mmm-hmm.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.458
She'd want me to make sure
that they're safe.

09:01.541 --> 09:07.004
Rest assured, I will play the role
of stern but foxy librarian to the hilt.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.764
[Judy mutters]

09:19.059 --> 09:21.269
All right.
You can do it.

09:30.987 --> 09:31.988
[sighs]

09:33.115 --> 09:34.366
[Linda] Guys, wait up!

09:34.449 --> 09:36.326
[Piper] Aw, can we keep her?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.578
[sighs] If you promise to feed her
and walk her every day.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.372
And she never comes into our bed.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.664
[inmates screaming]

09:41.748 --> 09:44.667
You are very long-legged women.
Ooh, are we seeing a movie?

09:45.752 --> 09:49.922
I heard he was shooting all the Muslims
execution style.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.384
-I heard it was an inmate.
-No, it was Humps.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.926
The guy's a psycho.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.345
Humps is a name?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.015
Who's the ranking officer here?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.435
Rick Hopper.
I'm the captain over at the Max facility.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.853
CO Piscatella is your man up here.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.438
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.357
Still inside, maybe.
I'm guessing.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.442
It's a developing situation.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.903
-What are your orders?
-Orders?

10:11.986 --> 10:13.905
We don't even know
whose jurisdiction this is yet.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.615
If it's a mass shooter, it's the feds.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.450
If it's a prison riot,
chain starts at MCC,

10:17.534 --> 10:19.244
and if it's a cat up a tree,
that's you guys.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.495
Oh, so that's how it's gonna be, huh?

10:20.578 --> 10:23.123
-They were yelling, "Attica."
-So it's a riot.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.916
We're not gonna jump to conclusions.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.294
[stutters] I'd rather it be a riot
than a shooter any day.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.796
Inmates can't organize.
And lady inmates?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.256
Come on.
I give 'em 15, 20 minutes

10:31.339 --> 10:32.507
before they're all pulling
each other's hair

10:32.590 --> 10:34.634
and begging us to come back inside.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.055
-Ma'am.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.350
[in Spanish]
You think they care about us?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.144
[inmates] No!

10:44.227 --> 10:47.188
Do they care if we live or die?

10:47.272 --> 10:49.232
-[inmates] No!
-"Do they care if we live or die?"

10:49.315 --> 10:50.608
[in Spanish]
They care about money!

10:50.692 --> 10:52.569
[in English]
"They care about the money."

10:52.652 --> 10:54.404
[inmates] <i>Sí!</i>

10:54.487 --> 10:56.323
-[in English] "Yes."
-I got that.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.658
[Maria in Spanish]
We are done getting shit on.

10:58.741 --> 11:03.413
From now on,
we're the ones doing the shitting!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.540
-[inmates cheering]
-[in English] "We are the shitters."

11:05.623 --> 11:07.417
Yeah, everything sounds better in Spanish.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.710
[Maria in Spanish] We're here,

11:08.793 --> 11:13.215
in this situation, 'cause of
how they been running this place,

11:13.298 --> 11:15.675
and now that we in charge,

11:15.758 --> 11:17.009
we gonna do better.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.177
[inmates cheering]

11:18.261 --> 11:19.971
[in English] Speak English!

11:21.138 --> 11:22.181
Fine.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.852
This motherfucking meeting
is called to order!

11:26.478 --> 11:27.895
[inmates cheering]

11:28.813 --> 11:31.065
Welcome to Litchfield 2.0!

11:34.486 --> 11:37.530
Still busted-ass,
but getting better by the minute.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.907
-[inmates laughing]
-[Maria] Now,

11:39.991 --> 11:43.703
because you're such
a special fucking audience,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.747
we got a free riot giveaway for you.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.374
Now don't fight, okay?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.709
You get a phone,
you get a phone,

11:49.792 --> 11:51.878
-you get a phone!
-[inmates cheering]

11:51.961 --> 11:53.880
You get a phone!

11:55.047 --> 11:57.634
Ass phones, <i>toti</i> phones...
Everybody gets a phone!

11:57.717 --> 11:59.511
[laughs] Not everybody.
Don't say everybody.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.429
Lots of people get phones!

12:01.513 --> 12:03.973
[in Spanish]
Welcome to the 21st century, bitches.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.892
You got chargers?

12:05.975 --> 12:08.102
We got no power, <i>pendeja.</i>
Use 'em till they die.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.479
[scoffs]

12:09.562 --> 12:10.647
Well, that was pretty exciting, huh?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.064
[inmates cheering]

12:12.148 --> 12:13.858
I can't hear you!

12:13.941 --> 12:16.110
[inmates cheering loudly]

12:16.193 --> 12:18.988
Now, hold onto your pants because
we got something real special comin' up.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.698
Hey, bring 'em in!

12:22.284 --> 12:24.952
[inmates laughing and cheering]

12:27.038 --> 12:28.498
Any of you little bitches
let go of that rope,

12:28.581 --> 12:29.874
we shoot you in the head.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.751
-[cheering continues]
-[Dixon] Don't push me.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.629
You know, I'm having, like,
a total kindergarten flashback.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.299
The shooting in the head part,
or the holding the rope part?

12:37.382 --> 12:38.591
Both.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.306
You're stepping on my foot.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.599
It's not like I'm doing it on purpose.
I can't see.

12:46.683 --> 12:50.061
-Okay, I'm out.
-Sit, sit, sit.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.856
Do you really wanna
call attention to us right now?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.483
Are those actual guards?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.072
This all we got?

13:01.155 --> 13:03.115
[in Spanish] There's two
still locked in the kitchen

13:03.199 --> 13:04.992
with those bald bitches.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.077
Oh.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.330
Too bad...

13:11.874 --> 13:13.501
[in English]
They're gonna miss all the fun.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.919
Strip search.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.212
[inmates laughing]

13:16.296 --> 13:18.089
You just love yelling shit out,
don't you?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.298
[inmates laughing]

13:19.382 --> 13:20.967
[inmates cheering]

13:24.512 --> 13:27.098
How are you holding up, pretty lady?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.141
Uh, where's Dr. DePalma?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.602
He had to run,

13:30.685 --> 13:33.355
but we will take
very good care of you.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.858
Oh, you can't fool me.
You're a nurse.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.612
She cuts hair.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.154
Well, lucky for you.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.575
If you're nice,
I'll fix that mess on your head.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.201
Looks like Danita's work.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.662
How's the pain, scale of one to ten?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.206
[grunts] Six.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.544
-[stammers] Maybe seven.
-There's no wrong answer.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.170
-[air hissing from device]
-Oh.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.551
BP's okay: 138/82.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.761
Good.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.887
[Adarsh] Burset?

14:06.804 --> 14:08.890
-Sorry, sorry.
-[Velcro rips]

14:11.350 --> 14:12.769
Where'd you go?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.312
I've been through something.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.900
We can work on that.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.987
There's people in real pain here.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.868
You think he'll die?

14:28.951 --> 14:30.244
I hope so.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.163
He deserves it.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.833
You think I deserve it?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.545
He got in your head.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.090
-Got in my head.
-Well, maybe he's already dead...

14:43.966 --> 14:46.678
and we're already dead,
and this is limbo.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.890
It does kinda look like it.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.771
[door opens]

14:56.854 --> 14:59.732
Change his IV bag.
I'll hook up his catheter.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.233
You get all the fun stuff.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.653
-Make sure you squeeze out the bubbles.
-I know.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.448
-It's not my first rodeo.
-[Suzanne] Yeah, um...

15:07.657 --> 15:08.658
Are we in limbo?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.535
Sure as shit we in limbo.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.081
Mmm-hmm.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.542
Mmm-hmm.

15:18.876 --> 15:19.877
If you ask me...

15:20.878 --> 15:24.466
this looks like
a pretty nasty group of criminals.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.092
[inmates cheering]

15:26.175 --> 15:28.428
And they're gathering
in groups of four or more.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.097
-[inmates cheering]
-So where should we start first?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.389
Chocolate City, huh?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.476
[inmates cheering]

15:35.643 --> 15:37.228
Or Vanilla Suburbs?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.688
[inmates groaning]

15:38.771 --> 15:41.357
-Looks like we have a winner.
-[inmates cheering]

15:41.441 --> 15:42.859
Oh, but wait a minute.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.777
Isn't that racial profiling?

15:44.861 --> 15:45.862
[inmates] Yes.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.030
But we don't do that here
in Litchfield, right?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.198
[inmates agreeing]

15:50.617 --> 15:54.537
-Look what I found.
-Oh! Whoa.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.416
Looks like somebody's going in the hole.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.042
[indistinct chatter]

16:00.126 --> 16:01.168
You want me to go in his hole?

16:01.252 --> 16:04.005
No, no, hold off.
We gotta build to that.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.172
That's actually my insulin.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.049
My insulin now, Chocolate City.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.676
I'm from rural Michigan.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.427
Let's check out
the suburbs now, shall we?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.138
-[inmates cheering]
-Yeah, that's right, ladies...

16:12.221 --> 16:13.347
[Luschek] Oh, no.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.558
Go deep.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.101
[Luschek grunting]

16:17.184 --> 16:19.353
Who knows what weapons
he could be hiding, huh?

16:19.437 --> 16:20.938
[in Spanish]
Oh, shit, his dick's hard.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.982
[in English] What? Oh!

16:23.065 --> 16:25.192
That happens when I get scared.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.194
Or turned on.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.577
Please.
I gave you tampons.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.912
-[gasps]
-We have a bond.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.874
Relax! You have a nice figure.
Don't get all body shamey.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.084
Your boobs are real creamy.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.377
[Maritza] Mmm-hmm.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.549
[Maria] Looks like we
haven't found that much yet.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.425
What else could we do?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.343
[Boyle] Go spelunking.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.428
The fuck is that?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.221
Cave dive!

16:54.305 --> 16:55.306
[inmates cheering]

17:01.020 --> 17:02.438
I'm not sure I like prison.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.065
Oh, come on.
Give it a chance.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.775
You don't think
that they're really gonna...

17:08.484 --> 17:09.945
[Alex] Hmm...

17:10.029 --> 17:12.615
This kinda reminds me of pledge week.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.411
-Fuck Sankey, I guess.
-[Stratman] Mmm-mmm.

17:17.493 --> 17:19.079
No, you gotta look past the hair, man.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.208
I mean, imagine the big one
with Sankey's hair.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.417
So you glue her scalp onto her head,

17:25.169 --> 17:27.171
you got a Pamela fucking Anderson.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.215
Pamela who?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.342
[scoffs] What, really?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.678
Who did you wank to, growing up?

17:33.761 --> 17:36.806
We, uh, weren't allowed.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.809
Yeah, no one's allowed, man.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.310
[Brandy] Hey, you suck.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.770
You and your stupid blue shirt.

17:44.814 --> 17:45.815
She's talking about you.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.108
Uh, what're you doing?

17:47.191 --> 17:49.360
Haven't you heard of negging?
It's a seduction technique.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.362
Hey, I fuckin' hate you.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.240
Um, okay.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.449
[both chuckling]

17:57.744 --> 17:58.745
Helen?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.079
I'm winking.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.626
That's blinking. You're blinking.
Winking is one eye.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.127
[Brandy] That's batting.
She's batting.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.587
[Helen] Winking.
[Sankey] Blinking.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.755
[Brandy] Batting.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.758
Oh, wait.
No, now it looks like she's got a tic.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.176
-She's ticking.
-[Sankey stammers] Just cut it out.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.763
-[blows]
-[Blake] It's all subjective, man.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.724
Come on, look at her tits!
How are those subjective?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.809
And she got those DSLs, you know?

18:21.893 --> 18:24.937
[stutters] Digital subscriber lines?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.939
Dick-sucking lips.
Jesus, man!

18:27.023 --> 18:28.065
Is there even come in these veins?

18:28.149 --> 18:29.734
-Huh? Yeah?
-Shut up! I have come!

18:29.817 --> 18:31.527
[Sankey] It's not gonna get
better than this, boys.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.237
[Blake and Stratman laughing]

18:33.320 --> 18:35.322
[chuckles] All right, moment of truth.
[sniffles]

18:37.366 --> 18:39.869
Got it. Fuck Helen, marry Sankey,
and then you kill Brandy.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.829
Nah, I gotta say...

18:41.913 --> 18:43.748
Fuck Sankey, marry Helen,

18:43.831 --> 18:45.332
kill Brandy.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.501
Man, I am not made of stone.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.211
You and me, blondie.
Let's do this.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.337
[chuckles]

18:50.963 --> 18:52.840
-Wait, I thought this was a hypothe--
-[dart stabs]

18:52.924 --> 18:55.301
[grunts] What was that?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.971
-Oh, fuck. It's a fucking dart!
-Well, get it out. Get it out, man!

18:59.055 --> 19:00.056
[Stratman stammers] All right.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.685
There you go.
Got it.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.353
[yells] Motherfuck! Oh!

19:06.437 --> 19:07.479
[Stratman grunts]

19:07.563 --> 19:09.691
Hey, nice knowing you, boys.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.318
What? Hey!
What do you mean, huh?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.488
Well, the poison acts quick.
Better save your strength.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.950
[chuckling]

19:27.458 --> 19:28.793
[Lloyd] Show me Polaris.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.047
There. In Ursa Minor's tail.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.882
And how do you find south?

19:34.966 --> 19:36.133
Orion.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.094
Daddy, this is little-girl stuff.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.679
And you're my little girl.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.222
Name the stars in his belt.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.808
Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.476
Okay, wise guy.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.979
What do you do if it's a cloudy night?

19:48.062 --> 19:49.856
-Hope for the best?
-[chuckles]

19:50.732 --> 19:53.109
Sometimes, knowledge can be dangerous.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.526
When you know
the right word for something,

19:54.610 --> 19:57.238
it can make you overconfident,
dull your senses.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.532
The planet always
has something to teach you.

20:01.784 --> 20:05.662
The second you're sure
you know where you are, you're lost.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.708
The second you're lost...

20:09.834 --> 20:10.918
you're dead.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.214
Told you to wear your dungarees.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.008
You're gonna freeze in that getup.
[grunts]

20:17.091 --> 20:18.718
I'm not cold.
I'm fine.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.430
You sure are cleanin' up there.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.726
I'm only missing two.
Ice Skating and Troop Dramatics.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.854
When you really know something...

20:31.105 --> 20:32.815
you don't need a badge for it.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.567
Bon appétit.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.408
[birds chirping]

20:59.926 --> 21:01.010
Dad!

21:02.469 --> 21:03.637
Daddy.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.559
Daddy!

21:11.520 --> 21:12.521
Dad!

21:40.091 --> 21:41.467
[tires screech]

21:42.426 --> 21:45.346
-What the hell is this?
-Desi! They didn't get you.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.807
-Boy, that's a load off.
-There have been shots fired,

21:47.890 --> 21:49.433
the inmates have seized the warden,

21:49.516 --> 21:51.768
and you thought you'd throw
a fucking tailgate party

21:51.853 --> 21:53.980
in the parking lot?
Jesus, Ricky.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.148
The warden's in there?
How do you know that?

21:56.232 --> 21:57.984
'Cause they made a fucking video.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.861
Think it might be time to storm?

21:59.944 --> 22:01.403
If we storm, we're only gonna escalate it.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.739
So escalate it!

22:07.034 --> 22:08.660
The best move is to let it die out.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.913
They don't know what they're doing.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.748
You don't know them like I do.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.542
[inmates clamoring]

22:21.382 --> 22:22.799
[Anita chuckles]

22:22.884 --> 22:25.552
That is one gay table.

22:25.636 --> 22:26.678
[chuckling]

22:26.762 --> 22:28.430
Look how the napkins

22:28.514 --> 22:31.600
match the little gingerbread houses
exactly.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.186
-[both chuckle]
-[Red] If you like <i>Christmas in Vienna,</i>

22:34.270 --> 22:36.898
wait till you see <i>Arabian Fantasy.</i>

22:36.981 --> 22:37.982
[Anita gasps] Ooh!

22:38.065 --> 22:39.608
[all laughing]

22:40.776 --> 22:45.572
Man, for every year we in here
it's like 100 Internet years.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.909
-Mmm.
-We ain't never gonna catch up.

22:47.992 --> 22:51.120
We gonna be like my momma
tryin' to work her DVDs.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.580
[Taystee] Like, now,
there's an app for scorin' dope.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.875
You know how many bitches in here would be
free people if they had that shit?

22:56.959 --> 22:59.086
I make my daughter teach me
all the new stuff.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.005
That helps a little.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.673
You never said you had a daughter.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.383
Well, you never asked.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.929
[Janae] Oh, hold up.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.555
We been retweeted.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.140
Praise black Jesus!

23:11.223 --> 23:14.185
-Show.
-All right. There's the link.

23:14.268 --> 23:15.602
Hashtag.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.398
"Black lattes matter."

23:19.481 --> 23:20.857
-What?
-Lattes?

23:20.941 --> 23:22.109
[music plays]

23:22.193 --> 23:24.070
[Janae] Oh. [chuckles]

23:24.153 --> 23:25.612
[slurping on video]

23:28.699 --> 23:30.617
-[all chuckling]
-[Black Cindy] What the...

23:30.701 --> 23:33.245
They ain't got me up there
with Sarah Palin...

23:35.747 --> 23:38.042
-[sighs]
-[Alison] Whoa.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.002
That shit is meta.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.670
[Black Cindy]
That don't even make no sense.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.548
"Black lattes matter"?
Lattes got milk.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.384
That's what make 'em lattes.
Ain't no "black latte,"

23:47.468 --> 23:50.387
'cause that would make it, like,
iced coffee or somethin'.

23:50.471 --> 23:54.100
[scoffs] That's a, uh...
What do you call that? Oxymormon?

23:54.183 --> 23:55.726
[voice breaking] It's all a joke.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.271
You okay, T?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.274
The whole point...

24:02.358 --> 24:05.611
was to tell the world about Poussey.
[breath trembling]

24:05.694 --> 24:08.197
Tell 'em what happened to our girl, man!

24:08.280 --> 24:09.906
People don't care!

24:11.533 --> 24:13.035
[crying]

24:18.624 --> 24:19.791
If we're already dead,

24:19.875 --> 24:21.752
maybe it wouldn't be murder
if we killed him again.

24:21.835 --> 24:25.131
[gasps] We could prop his feet up
a little bit above his head,

24:25.214 --> 24:27.424
so the blood all goes to one end.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.426
I hear that's really bad for you.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.178
No, that could take a while.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.971
We could take the feathers
out of his pillow

24:33.055 --> 24:34.681
and savagely tickle him to death.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.559
[scoffs] That's too gentle.

24:41.522 --> 24:45.484
Or... we could get a big jar of fire ants,

24:45.567 --> 24:47.486
and they could nibble at him.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.696
Yeah, better.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.242
-But you should get some honey.
-[Suzanne] Honey?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.161
Lead the ants where you want.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.539
Do you want them to go
in the guy's ears and eat his brain?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.915
Or his eyes?

25:01.458 --> 25:05.879
You don't want ants wandering all over.
You want them organized.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.633
-Where am I?
-Purgatory.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.635
Really?

25:13.429 --> 25:14.680
No!

25:14.763 --> 25:16.890
Lezzies go straight to hell.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.688
What are some other ways
you might kill someone?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.481
Oh, you can get really creative.

25:24.565 --> 25:28.527
In the Middle Ages,
they would do this cool thing.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.697
They'd attach a cage full of rats
to a guy's stomach.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.949
And then they'd put candles
on top of the cage,

25:34.032 --> 25:38.120
and the rats would burrow
into the guy's stomach to escape the heat.

25:38.204 --> 25:42.666
I had a scene like that in <i>Time Hump,</i>
except the rats were penises.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.210
And it wasn't a stomach.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.171
The Flesh Towers of Infamy.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.381
It's not super practical, of course.

25:49.465 --> 25:53.469
You gotta get a cage,
and you gotta get rats...

25:54.678 --> 25:58.474
Sometimes it's best to just use
whatever's available on hand.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.066
Come on!

26:08.150 --> 26:10.861
Open the door, Flores.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.113
Yeah.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.989
I prefer not.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.907
How'd you like ten more years in prison?

26:15.991 --> 26:17.993
I don't mind it so much
now that we running the place.

26:18.619 --> 26:22.664
[in Spanish] Go to the chapel.
Tell Maria the Jolly Gay Giant is back.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.251
-[laughs]
-[scoffs]

26:25.334 --> 26:26.502
[Piscatella in English]
When I get in there,

26:26.585 --> 26:29.671
I'm going to personally take you apart,
Piscatella style.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.797
[Blanca] If you can find me.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.966
I know we all look alike to you.

26:37.679 --> 26:41.475
Is this what you mean
by "Piscatella style"?

26:41.558 --> 26:42.934
Is that supposed to embarrass me?

26:43.018 --> 26:46.313
That took grand prize
at the Dutchess County Fair.

26:46.397 --> 26:47.731
I could not be prouder.

26:47.814 --> 26:51.818
The blind cannot see, the proud will not.

26:51.902 --> 26:56.573
Well, my vision's 20-20, lady,
and all I see is awesome.

26:56.657 --> 27:00.619
And in a matter of minutes,
we are going to take back this prison,

27:00.702 --> 27:03.705
and you are going to be
cooking roaches in Seg

27:03.789 --> 27:05.832
for the rest of your sorry life.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.001
Can you see that?

27:13.715 --> 27:15.759
I see many things.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.138
[Blanca] Is that a Russian proverb?

27:20.222 --> 27:21.848
That blind-proud thing?

27:21.932 --> 27:23.559
[Red] Real Russians have no proverbs.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.727
We have vodka and misery.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.275
Wait.
That was a proverb.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.946
[inmates chanting] Squat and cough!
Squat and cough!

27:36.029 --> 27:37.113
Squat and cough!

27:37.198 --> 27:39.115
-[Dixon whimpers] No, don't.
-[inmates cheering]

27:39.200 --> 27:41.743
My bad, ladies.
Seriously.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.496
Lesson learned.
Mea fuckin' culpa.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.748
[chuckling] Look at his Smurf dick.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.834
How is it a Smurf dick?
Smurfs are blue.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.211
It's not not blue.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.045
[in Spanish]
It's small with a droopy hat.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.130
That's Smurf enough for me.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.383
[in English] Hey, Cabrera, you got this.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.469
[Maria chuckles]

27:58.552 --> 28:00.095
Really?
You don't wanna?

28:00.178 --> 28:02.138
[scoffs] A good leader delegates.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.433
[inmates cheering]

28:04.516 --> 28:07.060
-Looks like we goin' to fifth base.
-Oh, Jesus.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.439
Don't worry.
I got talented fingers.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.525
[whimpers] Oh, please.
I'm so sorry.

28:13.609 --> 28:14.651
[crying]

28:15.569 --> 28:18.447
Please stop.
There's nothing in there.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.741
[grunts]

28:22.993 --> 28:24.661
[whispers] Yo, this is getting
kinda messed up.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.456
Yeah, if they're gonna kill 'em,
they should just kill 'em.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.333
-How're you okay with this?
-I'm not...

28:29.416 --> 28:33.003
I'm not okay with this, Alex.
We just need to be quiet, or they'll--

28:33.086 --> 28:35.922
I'm not gonna be quiet.
This is fucking insane.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.642
[smacks lips]
I don't wanna be a part of this.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.894
Most of us have done nothing wrong yet,

28:48.977 --> 28:51.938
so why should we all go down
because Diaz shot a guard?

28:52.022 --> 28:53.815
[Maria] Lots of us did shit
we're guilty for.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.609
-Not just Daya.
-[inmates murmuring]

28:58.404 --> 29:01.365
Good luck with your
Rumsfeld dinner theater. I'm out.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.496
[in Spanish] The big gay is back!

29:07.579 --> 29:08.580
Piscatella?

29:08.664 --> 29:10.874
-[in English] He's trying to storm.
-Let him.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.334
We could take down that walking tree.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.502
[inmates clamoring]

29:13.585 --> 29:17.005
Great, so more of us can end up
like the little black hooch maker?

29:17.088 --> 29:18.799
How does Ruiz always end up in charge?

29:18.882 --> 29:20.967
We gotta look into that.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.303
You think you can do better?

29:23.178 --> 29:25.889
I can't answer that right now.
I gotta think about it.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.933
[Guerrera] Just shoot Piscatella.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.476
-We got the gun, don't we?
-[inmates] Yeah.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.061
Oh, so you're in charge now?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.854
Never take on a heckler.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.694
[inmates clamoring]

29:38.777 --> 29:41.280
Ah! Enough!

29:41.363 --> 29:45.492
The gun ain't gonna beat
all the guns they got out there.

29:45.576 --> 29:48.161
What we got are hostages.

29:49.079 --> 29:52.374
If it wasn't for them, they'd have
burned this place down already.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.876
And whatever you feel
about what Daya did,

29:54.960 --> 29:57.588
the only way out
is for us to come together.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.632
We gotta show them on the outside
that we got their people,

30:00.716 --> 30:03.719
and they're fine now,
but that could change.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.262
It'll buy us time.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.264
Time?

30:09.725 --> 30:12.394
To figure out
what the fuck we gonna do.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.190
Who else we got out there?

30:17.273 --> 30:18.692
The black girls have Caputo.

30:18.775 --> 30:21.737
Those guards in the kitchen.
The one with the hair you wanna sit on?

30:21.820 --> 30:22.988
[in Spanish]
And the one with the hot mouth.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.073
Hair sitting?
[in English] Is that a thing?

30:25.156 --> 30:27.451
[in Spanish]
Everything's a thing.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.120
[in English] And Humps.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.622
Fuckin' Humps.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.671
Time for a family photo.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.385
Best day ever.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.638
This is better than the time
my mom let me babysit my little sister...

30:47.721 --> 30:51.767
[in Spanish] and I made her eat Alpo
Gravy Cravers wet dog food for dinner.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.685
She was a little bitch.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.687
[in English]
I really wanna just take a nap.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.939
Come on!
You the gangsta with the gun.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.149
Bangers don't nap.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.485
You're tired a lot lately.
You should maybe check your iron.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.278
What if Caputo doesn't wanna come with us?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.155
Dude used to be a boxer or some shit.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.699
So, then you point the gun at his head
and he'll change his mind.

31:07.783 --> 31:11.412
[sighs] If I tell you something,
will you promise not to tell Maria?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.580
Yeah, okay.

31:15.666 --> 31:16.792
It's gone.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.461
-You not tired anymore?
-The gun?

31:20.921 --> 31:21.922
I lost it.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.715
How do you lose a gun?

31:23.799 --> 31:25.258
I don't know.
Somebody knocked me out.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.469
I wake up, and I'm this person
who's supposed to have power,

31:27.553 --> 31:28.845
and I just fucking shot someone.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.972
[in Spanish]
Shit, I hate when people cry.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.767
[in English] Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.728
We've all pretended
to have guns that we don't have.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.980
-Right?
-Sure.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.899
I'll show you how
I make everyone think I got a gun.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.651
I'm like a expert.

31:47.781 --> 31:48.949
[Dayanara sighs]

31:49.700 --> 31:53.286
One thing I know, never let them
move you to a second location.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.705
That's when they kill you.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.290
Nobody's killing anybody.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.751
They need us alive to negotiate.

31:59.835 --> 32:02.629
Uh, think of any hostage movie ever.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.172
The hostages always die.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.842
They act like whiny bitches,
and then they die.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.386
What're you talking about?
Hostages never die.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.932
<i>Air Force One,</i> they're safe.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.308
<i>Speed,</i> safe.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.770
Well, what about the black guy
driving a bus?

32:19.855 --> 32:20.856
That's one.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.442
And the black guy
in <i>Assault on Precinct 13?</i>

32:23.525 --> 32:26.319
And the black guard in <i>Dog Day</i>
has an asthma attack.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.279
I'm sensing a pattern here.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.575
What, are you saying
we're safe because we're white?

32:31.658 --> 32:34.077
If we were in a movie, I'd say that.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.912
But we're not in a movie.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.914
[Alison] Horror movies are even worse.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.291
Black one's always toast.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.461
And by the way, one of the hostages

32:42.544 --> 32:44.295
does die in <i>Air Force One.</i>

32:45.839 --> 32:46.840
Which one?

32:46.923 --> 32:48.592
The PR person.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.720
Oh, yeah.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.642
[Josh] Oh, shit.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.227
Oh, shit.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.188
-You gotta hand them over.
-[scoffs]

33:02.272 --> 33:03.649
We ain't gotta nothin'.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.817
I got a gun that says you do.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.402
Cool down, Diaz.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.571
I think we should settle this with words.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.618
This is how we show the outside
that we got power.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.422
[unzips]

48:46.841 --> 48:48.926
[inmates cheering and laughing]

48:49.844 --> 48:52.597
Would you look at those bloomers!

48:52.680 --> 48:53.764
It's a temple garment.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.058
What are you...
what are you? Mormon?

48:56.141 --> 48:57.602
Still hot.

49:04.358 --> 49:05.610
What the hell?

49:05.693 --> 49:07.194
You don't fucking have it, do you?

49:07.277 --> 49:08.654
Have what?

49:08.738 --> 49:10.239
[Gloria] Maria.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.782
[in Spanish] Later.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.118
[Taystee] All right, everybody closer.

49:14.201 --> 49:16.036
Everybody get in.
We need to see everybody.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.121
[Luschek groans]

49:17.204 --> 49:18.789
Can we do this?
I... I really gotta pee.

49:18.873 --> 49:20.374
Quiet, boner boy.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.334
Do landscape, not portrait.

49:22.417 --> 49:23.669
What the hell is that?

49:23.753 --> 49:25.420
Sideways, not upways.

49:25.505 --> 49:26.506
[Black Cindy] "Upways"?

49:26.589 --> 49:29.383
Anybody else got any helpful tips?

49:29.466 --> 49:30.467
No!

49:31.385 --> 49:33.513
Good. All right.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.307
Everybody say, "Cheese!"

49:39.894 --> 49:42.187
-Cheese.
-Don't fucking say chee--

49:42.271 --> 49:43.814
[camera shutter clicks]

49:46.150 --> 49:48.027
