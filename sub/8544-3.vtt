09:29.394 --> 09:31.005
POLICE.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.876
[hissing]WHO'S IN HERE?

09:36.663 --> 09:39.274
STEP OUT SLOWLY.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.928
DON'T SHOOT.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.017
SET IT DOWN.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.322
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.759
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.068
WHAT'S THIS?

09:55.856 --> 09:57.945
LAXATIVES
IN THE WEDDING CAKE, HUH?

09:57.945 --> 09:59.860
THAT'S A CUTE MOVE.WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.383
OSCAR SALAS.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.950
THE GROOM'S BROTHER.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.343
WHY'D YOU WANT TO RUIN
YOUR BROTHER'S WEDDING, OSCAR?

10:05.343 --> 10:06.606
WHY NOT?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.998
YOU DON'T LIKE HIS FIANCéE?

10:07.998 --> 10:11.045
TWITTER FREAK.
COMPLETELY SELF-OBSESSED.

10:11.045 --> 10:15.049
THEY ALL ARE. CHILDREN WHO NEED
CONSTANT FEEDBACK.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.964
JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY TRY
THAT CAKE.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.401
I AM DYING TO READ
THAT TWEET.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.056
[clicks tongue]
WHAT ABOUT UNCLE LARRY?

10:22.056 --> 10:23.535
HE SEEMS COOL.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.015
AT LEAST HE DOESN'T
FOLLOW THE PACK.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.538
DID YOU KNOW HE WAS MURDERED
LAST NIGHT

10:26.538 --> 10:27.844
AFTER THE REHEARSAL DINNER?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.585
NO.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.675
ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT WANT
TO HURT HIM?

10:32.675 --> 10:34.982
YEAH. ANGEL.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.592
MY BROTHER'S BEST MAN.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.812
HE TALKED TRASH
ABOUT LARRY ALL THE TIME.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.465
I THINK HE SENT HIM
TEXT MESSAGES, TOO.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.555
WHAT WAS YOUR BEEF
WITH THE VICTIM?

10:43.555 --> 10:44.905
NO BEEF.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.254
WE HEARD YOU DIDN'T
LIKE HIM.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.864
[chuckles]
YOU HEARD WRONG.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.344
I DIDN'T HAVE NO OPINION
OF HIM.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.954
BARELY KNEW THE GUY.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.478
WE ALSO HEARD YOU HARASSED HIM
WITH TEXT MESSAGES.

10:53.478 --> 10:56.830
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.092
HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW ME
THOSE TEXTS?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.920
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
MY PHONE.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.617
I CAN HAVE A COURT ORDER HERE
IN 30 MINUTES.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.663
ONLY THEN, I'LL BE LOOKING
AT YOU AS A SUSPECT.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.404
[taps table rhythmically]

11:06.404 --> 11:08.102
[clicks tongue]

11:11.235 --> 11:13.760
[exhales]

11:13.760 --> 11:15.675
"HEY, LARRY, ANY WORD YET
FROM YOUR BOSS?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.199
I COULD REALLY USE THE WORK.
THANKS, BUDDY."

11:18.199 --> 11:21.202
HE WAS HELPING YOU
GET A PIZZA JOB?

11:21.202 --> 11:23.247
I NEED WORK. SO WHAT?

11:23.247 --> 11:25.772
YOU GET THE JOB?NOPE.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.425
DID YOU LEAVE THE WEDDING TENT
AT ANY POINT

11:27.425 --> 11:28.818
DURING THE AFTER PARTY?

11:28.818 --> 11:31.995
NO, I WAS THERE TILL THE END.
ASK ANYONE.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.868
AND LARRY WAS LONG GONE
BY THE TIME I LEFT.

11:37.087 --> 11:40.264
THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MRS. BONNER.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.832
DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
YOUR BROTHER LEAVE THE PARTY?

11:42.832 --> 11:45.966
[voice breaking] NO, I, UH...
I HAD A HEADACHE.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.402
I LEFT THE PARTY EARLY

11:47.402 --> 11:48.925
AND WALKED BACK
TO THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

11:48.925 --> 11:52.102
WHY WERE YOU
IN THE HONEYMOON SUITE?

11:53.669 --> 11:56.933
WE'RE PAYING
FOR THIS WEDDING.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.719
WHAT WAS THE VICTIM
DOING AT THE PARTY?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.459
THE USUAL.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.027
STANDING... WATCHING.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.597
TO BE HONEST,
I FELT SORRY FOR THE MAN.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.863
WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE VICTIM?

12:13.863 --> 12:16.257
[clicks tongue]
LARRY'S MY FIANCéE'S UNCLE,

12:16.257 --> 12:18.128
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
HE'S MY BLOOD.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.697
BUT WEIRD BLOOD, YOU KNOW?

12:21.697 --> 12:25.135
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYBODY WHO MAY
HAVE WANTED TO HARM THE VICTIM?

12:25.135 --> 12:27.442
NOBODY REALLY FELT
STRONGLY ENOUGH ABOUT HIM

12:27.442 --> 12:28.617
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.662
HE JUST KINDA...
FLOATED ALONG

12:30.662 --> 12:33.665
LIKE FAMILY FLOTSAM.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.625
[Suzie] THAT WAS
HIS STRENGTH, YOU KNOW?

12:36.625 --> 12:40.455
THE POWER
OF SOCIAL INVISIBILITY.

12:40.455 --> 12:43.197
I THINK I COULD HAVE
LOVED HIM.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.721
DID HE TALK TO ANYONE
AT THE PARTY?

12:45.721 --> 12:49.029
YES. MY SON'S FRIEND CHARLIE
FROM COLLEGE.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.813
DID YOU KNOW ROBERTO
WENT TO COLLEGE?

12:50.813 --> 12:53.424
FIRST IN THE FAMILY.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.557
WELL, I WAS PRETTY TOASTED.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.472
BUT I THINK LARRY WAS
TALKING ABOUT A NEW RIFLE.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.343
SAID HE BOUGHT IT
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.954
RIFLE? ARE YOU SURE?

13:00.954 --> 13:03.739
THE VICTIM DOESN'T HAVE
ANY RECORD OF GUN OWNERSHIP.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.872
[sighs] I THINK HE WAS
JUST TRYING TO FIT IN.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.482
YOU KNOW, BE ONE OF THE GUYS.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.701
SAME REASON LARRY OFFERED TO GO
ON A LIQUOR RUN FOR US.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.095
DID YOU SEE THE VICTIM
LEAVE THE PARTY?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.838
NO HABLO INGLéS.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.754
[Lisbon] EXCUSE ME.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.540
[police radio chatter,
phones ringing]

13:26.283 --> 13:29.417
SOMEBODY IN THAT WEDDING PARTY
HAD TO HAVE SEEN SOMETHING.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.159
LOVE IS IN THE AIR,
LISBON.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.378
THESE TWO FAMILIES ARE
ABOUT TO BE MARRIED.

13:34.378 --> 13:37.077
THEY'RE NOT GONNA TURN
ON EACH OTHER WITHOUT A PUSH.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.122
WHAT KIND OF PUSH?

13:39.122 --> 13:40.820
IF WE WANT TO LEARN
WHO KILLED UNCLE LARRY,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.517
THEN WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AIR.

13:42.517 --> 13:45.650
THAT MEANS NO MORE PLAYING NICE
FOR THE HAPPY COUPLE.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.565
WE NEED SOME HONESTY.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.741
WHO'S NOT BEING HONEST?WELL, YOU, FOR STARTERS.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.265
YOU'RE THE GROOM'S SISTER,
I TAKE IT.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.570
AND MY BRIDESMAID.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.094
YES, THAT WAS A LOVELY GESTURE,

13:54.094 --> 13:55.617
BUT YOU PUT HER
IN A VERY AWKWARD POSITION,

13:55.617 --> 13:57.184
BECAUSE SHE RESENTS YOU.NO, I DON'T.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.229
YES, YOU DO. BE HONEST.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.883
DO YOU RESENT ME, ROSE?

14:00.883 --> 14:04.756
YOU TALK DOWN TO MY BROTHER!
YOU'RE ALWAYS CORRECTING HIM.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.758
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHEN HAS SHE EVER--NOT NOW, ROBERTO.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.457
ROSE, ARE YOU MAD AT ME

14:09.457 --> 14:12.242
BECAUSE I PAID
FOR YOUR BRIDESMAID DRESS?

14:12.242 --> 14:14.201
YOU DIDN'T PAY
FOR MYDRESS.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.680
[lowered voice]
YOU DON'T WORK IN RETAIL.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.204
NOW SHE'S DOING IT TO ME.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.683
STACEY WAS AN ENGLISH MAJOR,
CHICA.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.468
SHE JUST SOUNDS SUPERIOR.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.036
"CHICA"?MY DAUGHTER
IS NOT YOUR HOUSEMAID.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.602
HEY. SHE SPEAKS ENGLISH.MM.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.866
CAN WE ALL SHOW SOME
RESPECT HERE, PLEASE?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.606
WE'RE A FAMILY NOW.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.173
YES, ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.435
IS THAT WHY YOU HOOKED UP
WITH THE BRIDE'S MOTHER

14:31.435 --> 14:32.784
AT THE AFTER PARTY?

14:32.784 --> 14:34.482
HMM? HMM? WHAT WAS THAT?

14:34.482 --> 14:36.658
YOU SAID THAT YOUR WIFE
HAD A MIGRAINE LAST NIGHT,

14:36.658 --> 14:39.008
WHICH IS THE ENABLERS' CODE
FOR "DRUNK."

14:39.008 --> 14:42.446
AND TODAY, SHE CAN'T LOOK
THE GROOM'S FATHER IN THE EYE.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.492
THAT'S WHY SHE WASN'T
AT THE WINE TASTING

14:44.492 --> 14:45.928
THIS MORNING.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.756
YOU MADE A MOVE ON MY MOM?

14:47.756 --> 14:49.845
WHY ARE YOU BLAMING PAPI?
MAYBE YOUR MOM'S THE ADULTERER.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.152
ADULTRESS.STOP CORRECTING HIM!

14:52.152 --> 14:55.024
YEAH! I SEE IT NOW.OKAY, SHUT UP!

14:55.024 --> 14:58.593
THIS IS MY WEDDING DAY,
AND I WILL SAY AND DO

14:58.593 --> 15:00.812
WHATEVER I WANT.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.814
AND WHAT I WANT...

15:02.814 --> 15:04.468
IS TO CANCEL THIS WEDDING.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.688
[gasping and murmuring]

15:06.688 --> 15:08.603
[Stacey sighs]LIFE. HAPPENING.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.126
STACEY,
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.388
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
PLANNING THIS FOR MONTHS.

15:11.388 --> 15:14.261
I FLEW IN FROM FLORIDA
TO BE HERE.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.002
YOU'RE ALL ON YOUR OWN.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.178
[sighs]NICE PUSH.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.484
AH, SOMETHING GOOD WILL
COME OUT OF THIS. YOU'LL SEE.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.923
CAN WE GO BACK TO NAPA NOW?PLEASE.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.973
THAT NEITHER SIDE OF THE FAMILY
APPROVES OF THE WEDDING,

15:30.973 --> 15:32.192
BUT THEY'RE BOTH PRETENDING
LIKE THEY DO.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.671
NOT ANYMORE.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.195
I FOLLOWED UP
ON THAT RIFLE TIP.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.587
ACCORDING TO BANK RECORDS,
UNCLE LARRY WROTE

15:36.587 --> 15:38.198
A PERSONAL CHECK FOR ONE
TWO WEEKS AGO.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.678
WE NEED CONTACT INFORMATION
FOR THE FIREARMS DEALER.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.332
A PRIVATE RANCHER
SOLD IT TO HIM.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.204
JAMES HARRIS.
I HAVE AN ADDRESS.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.946
THE VICTIM SAID HE BROUGHT
A RIFLE TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.035
LET'S FIND OUT FROM WHO.
RIGSBY, YOU'RE WITH ME.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.124
I'LL RUN BACKGROUND CHECKS
ON THE INVITATION LIST.

15:53.648 --> 15:57.521
[quacking]

15:57.521 --> 15:59.697
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO SOLVE A CRIME,

15:59.697 --> 16:01.351
NOT, UH,
DESTROY A WEDDING.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.224
WELL, I'D SAY THE KILLER
DID THAT.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.574
I'M PREPARED TO MARVEL
AT YOUR INSIGHT.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.010
WHO'S THE KILLER?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.533
STILL WORKING ON IT.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.231
REALLY? I'M SURPRISED.
I'D HAVE...

16:11.231 --> 16:14.190
I'D HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE HIM
IN CUFFS BY NOW.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.714
OH, I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU.[chuckles]

16:16.714 --> 16:19.413
JANE. MRS. BONNER WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.547
[sighs]

16:23.547 --> 16:25.201
[voice breaking]
YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.943
BEFORE I LEFT THE PARTY,
MR. SALAS AND I SHARED A KISS.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.511
[sniffles]
A DRUNKEN, MISTAKEN KISS.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.295
HMM.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.472
UH, WHERE DID THIS, UH,
INEBRIATED SMOOCH TAKE PLACE?

16:35.472 --> 16:37.474
BEHIND THE CHAPEL.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.521
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
HERE BY THE POND?

16:40.521 --> 16:43.741
NO, BUT WE HEARD A SPLASH
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

16:43.741 --> 16:47.093
DID YOU HEAR ANY... SCREAMS
OR SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE?

16:47.093 --> 16:49.834
I SHOULD HAVE GONE
TO HELP HIM.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.314
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.055
IT SEEMS HE WAS KILLED
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.362
THE BODY WAS JUST DUMPED HERE.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.017
HIDING THE BODY UNTIL
AFTER THE WEDDING IN THE POND,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.845
WHICH IS NOT SUCH A GREAT
HIDING PLACE, I WOULD THINK.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.673
A LITTLE TOO PUBLIC.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.197
BELLA VISTA.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.938
[Italian accent]
BELLA VISTA.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.244
[normal voice]
"BEAUTIFUL VIEW" IN ITALIAN.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.072
WHERE IS THIS, UH,
BELLA VISTA?

17:10.072 --> 17:12.553
THROUGH THE TREES.

17:15.164 --> 17:18.124
[birds chirping]

17:21.866 --> 17:24.217
WOW.

17:24.217 --> 17:27.089
NOW THIS IS A PLACE
TO DUMP A BODY.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.960
TAKE A LOOK. HUH?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.050
KILLER HAULS THE BODY
TO THE POND.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.529
JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER,

17:32.529 --> 17:34.227
AND HE COULD HAVE DUMPED IT
RIGHT HERE.

17:34.227 --> 17:37.491
HE'S RIGHT. NOBODY'S FINDING
ANYTHING DOWN THERE.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.145
COME OVER HERE, FELLA.
HAVE A LOOK.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.452
YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE VIEW.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.282
UH, TELL US WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING AT.

17:46.282 --> 17:47.718
UH...[police radio chatter]

17:47.718 --> 17:51.200
EXCUSE ME.
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.897
[lowered voice]
STRIKE TWO.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.290
YOU BELIEVE ME NOW?

18:06.346 --> 18:09.653
HEY, CHO, YOU THINK
I'M A MARRYING TYPE?

18:09.653 --> 18:11.394
YOU PROPOSED
TO YOUR BABY MAMA.

18:11.394 --> 18:14.267
WELL, YEAH, BUT EVERY KID
DESERVES TWO PARENTS.

18:14.267 --> 18:17.444
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
VAN PELT.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.447
YOU KNOCK HER UP, TOO?NO.

18:20.447 --> 18:22.013
SO WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

18:22.013 --> 18:25.016
WELL, YOU CLEARLY MISSED
THE DEPARTMENTAL MEMO.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.627
THEY CHANGED THE POLICY
ON OFFICE RELATIONSHIPS.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.455
DON'T HAVE TO LAY LOW
ANYMORE.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.327
HMM. GOOD FOR YOU.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.286
WE COULD EVEN GET MARRIED
IF WE WANTED TO.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.809
AH.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.593
THAT'S IT? "AH"?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.595
SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.684
NO. MAYBE.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.165
NO. I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.254
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT MY FAULT?

18:45.254 --> 18:47.343
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.345
IT'S MY CALL.

18:53.349 --> 18:54.829
[turns off engine]

18:59.703 --> 19:02.010
YOU'RE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

19:02.010 --> 19:05.448
CBI AGENTS.
YOU JAMES HARRIS?

19:05.448 --> 19:06.928
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.059
YOU SELL A RIFLE TO A MAN
NAMED LARRY KINCAID

19:08.059 --> 19:09.757
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO?

19:09.757 --> 19:12.847
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE.
I'D HAVE TO CHECK MY RECEIPTS.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.240
IT'S A VIOLATION
OF STATE LAW

19:14.240 --> 19:16.198
FOR YOU TO SELL FIREARMS
WITHOUT A LICENSE.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.678
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
IN THE BARN?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.202
MY PRIVATE ARSENAL.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.204
OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.727
KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.735
IF I RECALL,

19:31.735 --> 19:35.348
LARRY BOUGHT ONE OF THESE.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.438
A GENUINE
1840 SPRINGFIELD MUSKET.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.831
IT'S RIGGED UP
TO FIRE BLANKS NOW.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.836
YOU'RE A CIVIL WAR
RE-ENACTOR.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.534
THAT'S RIGHT--
FIELD COMMANDER

19:47.534 --> 19:48.970
FOR THE NAPA VALLEY
CUMBERLAND GUARD,

19:48.970 --> 19:51.102
156th REGIMENT.

19:51.102 --> 19:54.193
[sighs] WE GOT A BATTLE
NEXT WEEK IN FORT POINT.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.892
THAT MUST BE WHAT THE "156"
MEANT ON THE VICTIM'S SHIRT.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.198
WHAT VICTIM?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.287
LARRY WAS MURDERED LAST NIGHT

20:01.287 --> 20:02.940
BEHIND THE BELLA VISTA
CHAPEL.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.813
VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.555
YOU KNOW OF ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE
WANTED TO HURT THE VICTIM?

20:08.555 --> 20:11.558
OH, GOD, NO. NO.
LARRY WAS A HARMLESS SORT.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.689
[blade zings]

20:12.689 --> 20:15.431
QUIET, BUT...
A GOOD SOLDIER.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.999
HIS LOSS IS GONNA LEAVE
A REAL WHOLE

20:17.999 --> 20:20.436
IN OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.395
[drum rattling][grunts]

20:22.395 --> 20:25.267
YOU BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.767
OH, PLEASE, DON'T STOP
PRAYING ON MY ACCOUNT.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.421
OH, I'M NOT PRAYING.

20:48.421 --> 20:52.425
TEXTING. IN CHURCH.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.122
ISN'T THAT A SIN?

20:54.122 --> 20:57.125
I HOPE NOT. I MAKE
MY LIVING WITH MY THUMBS.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.388
[exhales]

20:59.388 --> 21:03.262
I'M, UH, SORRY
FOR BUSTING YOUR WIFE.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.351
IT'S NOT THE FIRST
DRUNKEN KISS

21:05.351 --> 21:07.483
SHE'S SHARED WITH A MAN
THAT WASN'T ME.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.356
AND I'M SURE IT WON'T BE
THE LAST.

21:10.356 --> 21:13.272
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO KILLED HER BROTHER?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.448
I BELIEVE IT WAS SOMEONE
FROM THE WEDDING PARTY.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
NO. NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.408
NO ONE HAD ANY REASON
TO KILL UNCLE LARRY.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.845
IT WOULD BE LIKE...
KILLING A LLAMA.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.194
WHY WOULD YOU?

21:23.194 --> 21:24.370
THEY SPIT?

21:24.370 --> 21:25.719
[chuckles]

21:25.719 --> 21:26.981
WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.939
I'M A SPECULATOR.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.507
I LOOK
FOR UNDERVALUED ASSETS.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.596
WHAT KIND OF ASSETS?

21:33.596 --> 21:34.989
OH, ARTWORKS, ISLANDS--

21:34.989 --> 21:37.121
ANYTHING I CAN BUY LOW
AND SELL HIGH.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.733
LAST MONTH I FOUND
A FIRST EDITION

21:39.733 --> 21:41.517
COVERDALE BIBLE
AT A CHURCH AUCTION,

21:41.517 --> 21:43.389
PRINTED IN 1535.

21:43.389 --> 21:46.522
I WAS GONNA DO A READING
FROM IT AT THE WEDDING.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.092
HOW MUCH IS THAT WORTH?

21:51.092 --> 21:53.573
OH, UH, HALF A MILLION.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.226
WOW.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.228
FOR AN ANTIQUE BIBLE.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.016
WHERE IS IT NOW?

22:02.016 --> 22:03.713
WITH A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM.

22:03.713 --> 22:07.369
THEY WERE GONNA DELIVER IT
HERE FOR THE WEDDING TONIGHT.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.285
MIGHT AS WELL JUST
SELL IT NOW.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.678
[sniffs]

22:13.854 --> 22:16.900
[telephone rings]AGENT VAN PELT.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.293
[lowered voice]
GRACE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.730
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT
OUR YOUNG LOVERS

22:20.730 --> 22:22.602
GO AHEAD WITH THE WEDDING
AS PLANNED.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.865
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
YOU RUINED A GIRL'S WEDDING.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.867
YES, AND I LACK THE PUTTY

22:26.867 --> 22:28.434
TO SPACKLE THOSE
EMOTIONAL WOUNDS.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.000
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING YOU.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.350
I HAVE PUTTY?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.917
NO,
YOU HAVE LIFE EXPERIENCE.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.484
USE IT TO CONVINCE
THE BRIDE

22:35.484 --> 22:38.182
THAT HER "HAPPILY EVER AFTER"
BEGINS TONIGHT.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.097
[sighs] REALLY?

22:40.097 --> 22:41.534
[snaps cell phone shut]

22:43.710 --> 22:45.842
[sighs] JANE IS FEELING
REALLY BADLY

22:45.842 --> 22:47.844
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE BULL PEN.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.977
HE SHOULDN'T.

22:49.977 --> 22:53.633
THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK.
HE DID ME A HUGE FAVOR.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.199
YOUR FAMILIES
DON'T WANT THE MARRIAGE.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.987
MOM SAYS I'M TOO SMART
FOR ROBERTO.

22:59.987 --> 23:02.424
AND MY DAD IS WORRIED
HE WON'T BE ABLE

23:02.424 --> 23:04.383
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.254
AND ROBERTO'S PARENTS
JUST WANT HIM TO MARRY

23:06.254 --> 23:07.777
A NICE CATHOLIC GIRL.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.431
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:13.174 --> 23:14.784
I WANT ROBERTO.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.919
BUT...

23:18.919 --> 23:21.051
IT'S TOO COMPLICATED.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.184
SO YOU'RE GONNA
THROW IT AWAY?

23:26.448 --> 23:29.799
LOOK... [sighs]

23:29.799 --> 23:31.975
[chuckles]

23:31.975 --> 23:35.109
I HAD SOMEONE I WANTED TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

23:35.109 --> 23:41.463
BUT... STAYING TOGETHER
WOULD HAVE ENDED MY CAREER.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.119
SO I LET HIM GO.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.468
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:46.468 --> 23:47.730
OH... [sighs]

23:47.730 --> 23:49.515
[chuckles]

23:49.515 --> 23:51.386
I GOT ENGAGED
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.694
THAT ENDED BADLY.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.870
SO I SHUT DOWN
A LITTLE INSIDE.

23:56.870 --> 24:01.352
CLOSED SOME DOORS
TO FEEL SAFER. BUT...

24:01.352 --> 24:04.399
THE PROBLEM IS
WITH EVERY PASSING YEAR,

24:04.399 --> 24:06.662
YOU CLOSE MORE DOORS.

24:06.662 --> 24:09.796
UNTIL EVENTUALLY...

24:09.796 --> 24:12.625
YOU WONDER IF ANYONE
WILL EVER GET INSIDE AGAIN.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.803
THAT'S REALLY TRAGIC.YEAH.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.588
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I KEEP THE DRESS.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.677
YOUR WEDDING DRESS?

24:21.677 --> 24:24.158
[chuckles] I KNOW.
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

24:24.158 --> 24:27.030
BUT...

24:27.030 --> 24:30.556
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHO I WAS...

24:30.556 --> 24:34.211
[clicks tongue] NAIVE.
MAYBE A LITTLE FOOLISH, BUT...

24:34.211 --> 24:37.171
[voice breaking]
FULL OF HOPE.

24:39.739 --> 24:42.481
I'M AFRAID IF I DESTROY
THAT DRESS...

24:45.396 --> 24:50.010
I'LL FORGET
WHAT HOPE FEELS LIKE.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.839
[sighs]

24:56.364 --> 24:58.714
[indistinct conversations]

24:58.714 --> 24:59.715
[lowered voice]
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

24:59.715 --> 25:01.587
ABOUT McALLISTER?

25:01.587 --> 25:03.110
[lowered voice] WELL, UNTIL
I GET SOME ALONE TIME WITH HIM,

25:03.110 --> 25:04.981
I'M NOT GONNA DRAW
ANY CONCLUSIONS.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.549
WELL, HE'S AVOIDED HEIGHTS
TWICE.

25:07.549 --> 25:12.249
IF RED JOHN IS ACROPHOBIC,
WHY WOULD HE TELL MY SHRINK?

25:12.249 --> 25:14.904
TO GAIN HER TRUST
SO HE COULD STEAL HER FILE--

25:14.904 --> 25:18.038
WHICH HE DID
RIGHT BEFORE HE KILLED HER.

25:18.038 --> 25:19.387
GUESS WHAT?

25:19.387 --> 25:21.432
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
NO HARD FEELINGS.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.391
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT DECISION.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.785
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU--
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW,

25:25.785 --> 25:27.569
WE WILL HAVE TO ATTEND
THE CEREMONY,

25:27.569 --> 25:31.573
JUST IN CASE UNCLE LARRY'S
KILLER REVEALS HIMSELF.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.793
OKAY.UH, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW US.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.056
THE COURTHOUSE CLOSES.COURTHOUSE?

25:36.056 --> 25:38.449
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR BIG NAPA WEDDING?

25:38.449 --> 25:40.277
IT'S A WASTE, BUT, I MEAN,
WHAT CAN WE DO?

25:40.277 --> 25:42.410
I CAN'T FIND A PRIEST.
I CANCELED HIM THIS MORNING.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.934
AND WE ONLY HAVE THE CHAPEL
FOR TWO MORE HOURS. SO...

25:44.934 --> 25:47.067
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT TURNS OUT
THAT I AM, IN FACT,

25:47.067 --> 25:50.200
A CERTIFIED WEDDING
OFFICIANT.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.898
I CAN MARRY YOU.[chuckles] OH, MY GOSH.

25:51.898 --> 25:54.291
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.
THANK YOU.THANK YOU SO MUCH.

25:54.291 --> 25:57.251
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.[Stacey chuckles]

25:57.251 --> 26:00.341
OH, YOU ARE NOT
LEGALLY ORDAINED.YEAH, I'VE NEVER USED IT.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.082
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS
A HANDY THING TO HAVE.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.258
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.I SWEAR.

26:04.258 --> 26:07.130
I COULD MARRY YOU OFF
IN A MINUTE.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.262
HEY, RON.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.656
DON'T TEMPT ME.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.448
YEAH, IT'S PATRICK JANE.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.102
What can I do for you,
Patrick?

26:22.102 --> 26:24.278
WELL, I'M AT THE CHAPEL.
WE HAVE A BREAK IN THE CASE.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.975
HOW SOON CAN YOU
MEET ME HERE?

26:25.975 --> 26:28.717
REAL SOON.

26:28.717 --> 26:32.852
FUNNY THING, I, UH,
SAW YOUR CAR IN THE LOT,

26:32.852 --> 26:34.680
AND I WAS JUST COMING
TO FIND YOU.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.118
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COMING.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.598
YOU MOVE QUIETLY.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.903
WELL, IT'S AN OLD HABIT.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.557
I'VE BEEN A HUNTER
MOST OF MY LIFE.

26:42.557 --> 26:45.255
REALLY? WHAT DO YOU HUNT?

26:45.255 --> 26:47.475
ANYTHING WITH A FACE.
[chuckles]

26:47.475 --> 26:49.651
GAME IS GAME, RIGHT?

26:49.651 --> 26:51.827
YOU HUNT?ME? NO.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.568
NO. TOO SQUEAMISH. I--

26:53.568 --> 26:56.745
I COULDN'T HANDLE ALL
THE SKINNING AND THE GUTTING.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.356
YEAH. SURE, YEAH.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.358
CLEAN AND QUARTER A KILL.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.491
IT TAKES SOME STOMACH
FOR THAT.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.232
AND A CERTAIN BLOODLUST.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.103
[chuckles]

27:07.103 --> 27:10.237
THERE'S A GRAIN OF TRUTH
IN THAT.

27:10.237 --> 27:14.458
SO YOU GOT A BREAK IN
THE DUCK POND KILLER CASE?WELL...

27:14.458 --> 27:17.766
LESS A BREAK, BUT, UH,
MORE A PLAN.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.638
I'M GONNA REVEAL
THE KILLER TONIGHT.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.422
AND I NEED YOU
AND YOUR PEOPLE

27:21.422 --> 27:23.032
TO JUST HANG BACK.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.991
NO PROBLEM.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.254
I TRULY APPRECIATE YOU
MAKING MY JOB EASIER FOR ME.

[indistinct conversations]

27:36.829 --> 27:37.960
YOU LOOK GREAT.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.701
THANK YOU, WAYNE.

27:41.268 --> 27:45.533
JANE THINKS OUR MAN'S GONNA TRY
TO SNEAK OUT OF THE RECEPTION.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.230
WE NEED TO BE THERE.
I'M GONNA FOLLOW HIM.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.711
WHAT IF HE'S TOO CAUTIOUS
TO MAKE A MOVE WHILE WE'RE HERE?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.104
IF HE'S IN
THE RECEPTION TENT

27:51.104 --> 27:52.975
FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS,
JANE WANTS YOU TO CREATE

27:52.975 --> 27:54.629
SOME SORT OF DISTRACTION.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.413
HE THINKS IT'LL
ENCOURAGE HIM OUT.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.459
WHAT KIND OF DISTRACTION?YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T WORRY.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.026
I CAN HANDLE THIS.GREAT.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.027
GREAT. LET'S SPLIT UP.

HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS
BEFORE?

28:36.018 --> 28:37.193
HAVE YOU?

28:37.193 --> 28:38.847
YES. I'M MARRIED.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.544

28:40.544 --> 28:41.676
KISSING.

28:41.676 --> 28:44.461
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

28:44.461 --> 28:47.421
OKAY, UM...

28:47.421 --> 28:49.510
IF THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS...

NOPE, OKAY.
