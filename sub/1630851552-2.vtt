WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:25.192
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:25.275 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:38.330 --> 00:40.541
"Rusty's Chance to Dance."

00:45.796 --> 00:47.798
There you go, Daisy. Drink up.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.802
Thanks, Otis.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.263
Would you look at that?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.431
What is it, Rusty?

00:56.515 --> 00:58.433
It's the harvest moon.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.144
It's so pretty.

01:02.104 --> 01:06.692
We used to have dances
all the time on nights like this. See?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.781
Hopping hay bales!

01:12.865 --> 01:13.991
Cool.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.328
And this is how you do my favorite dance.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.498
Now, jump, jump, jump
Right off the ground

01:21.582 --> 01:24.918
Then spin, spin, spin
Go round and round

01:27.838 --> 01:31.133
Way to move. I want to try.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.595
Jump, jump, jump
Right off the ground

01:34.678 --> 01:37.931
Then spin, spin, spin
Go round and round

01:39.057 --> 01:41.977
I had so much fun at those dances.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.980
We should have a dance tonight.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.773
Great idea, Otis.

01:46.857 --> 01:50.152
Wowie-wow. A dance. I'll tell everyone.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.697
We just have to find the perfect spot.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.781
I'll help.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.491
Great. This way.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.126
We're gonna have a dance tonight
We're gonna have a dance tonight

02:06.835 --> 02:08.044
With music.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.545
And singing.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.756
And dancing!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.382
Yeah!

02:12.466 --> 02:16.929
Look, Otis, the harvest moon
is shining right on the hayfield.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.515
That's the perfect spot.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.183
The hayfield's the perfect spot

02:21.266 --> 02:22.601
The hayfield is--

02:22.684 --> 02:24.186
Wha--

02:25.062 --> 02:26.688
A mess!

02:27.898 --> 02:30.234
There's no room to dance at all.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.112
I can barely get through.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.290
There's no way I can move
all these carts and hay bales.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.583
Hit the brakes.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.962
Rusty? Are you okay?

02:50.045 --> 02:54.341
This is the perfect spot,
but there's no room to dance.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.261
I don't think
we can have the dance anymore.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.264
I am so disappointed.

03:03.809 --> 03:07.187
Everyone else
is going to be disappointed too.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.398
Maybe we can still have it.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.109
Can I help you clean everything up?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.735
Sure, Otis,

03:13.819 --> 03:17.322
but it's going to take a lot of work
to get this field ready in time.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.867
I'm a hearty helper.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.535
Well, all right, then.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.120
Let's get rolling.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.749
Yeah!

03:33.255 --> 03:35.257
Not too shabby.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.509
Just a little tractor trick.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.637
Looks like we might be able
to have this dance after all.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.556
Farm-tastic!

03:42.639 --> 03:44.641
So, what should I do next?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.476
I'll tell you!

03:47.603 --> 03:50.314
First, pull those carts
Off to the side

03:50.397 --> 03:53.233
I'll give each one a little ride

03:56.153 --> 03:58.530
Move those tires stacked up tall

03:58.614 --> 04:01.116
I'll hold them tight
So they don't fall

04:04.286 --> 04:06.997
Stack those hay bales to the sky

04:07.080 --> 04:09.791
I think I can reach up that high

04:13.003 --> 04:14.171
I did it!

04:14.254 --> 04:16.798
Now hang those streamers
Here and there

04:16.882 --> 04:19.968
I'll hang them all around the square

04:22.137 --> 04:24.973
We cleaned the mess up off the ground

04:25.057 --> 04:27.809
I'm so happy I can wiggle around

04:32.314 --> 04:33.982
You did it, Otis.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.778
Thanks to you, there's plenty of room
to do my favorite dance.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.822
Now, jump, jump, jump
Right off the ground

04:40.906 --> 04:43.617
Then spin, spin, spin
Go round and round

04:45.744 --> 04:47.829
I'm getting a little creaky tonight.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.960
Looks like you have
one more streamer on your seat, Rusty.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.711
Let's get that on a hay bale.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.049
Way to wiggle.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.262
This wiggling has got me giggling.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.599
Look how high the moon is now.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.185
It's almost time for the dance.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.856
Good thing we have
the perfect spot to dance in.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.023
High tire.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.860
Next, we need the music.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.534
Come on, you old radio.
We're counting on you.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.453
Hit the brakes.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.080
What's wrong?

05:30.914 --> 05:33.709
I guess this radio is not working so well.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.627
Just like me.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.047
We can't have a dance without music.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.383
I'm really upset.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.554
How can I help, Rusty?

05:45.637 --> 05:48.599
I'm not sure. We better think.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.977
We just need to use
the gears between our ears.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.439
Putt, puff, puttedy chance

05:55.522 --> 05:58.317
I'll think of a way
To save Rusty's dance

06:06.450 --> 06:08.327
Great gears. That's it.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.416
What if we made our own music?

06:19.171 --> 06:21.465
But we don't have any instruments.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.760
Maybe our friends
can help us make instruments.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.345
Let's get rolling.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.973
Right behind you, Otis.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.356
Stretch. Stretch.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.233
-Hey, everyone.
-Hiya, folks.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.569
Otis. Rusty. We're ready for the dance.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.739
Actually, we need your help
making the music.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.659
How do we cock-a-doodle-do that?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.202
Let me show you.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.831
Turn this bucket upside-down.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.835
Tap it and it makes a sound.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.128
Now there's a beat.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.341
Drumming?

07:05.259 --> 07:06.885
I'm drumming!

07:09.429 --> 07:12.182
Give this jug a nice big blow.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.854
We're making music as we go.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.981
What about me? What about me?

07:19.064 --> 07:21.817
Take that washboard off the wall.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.403
Strum it and we'll play them all.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.995
Play them loud and all together.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.956
This music's getting better and better.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.216
Hey. Nice wiggling, Rusty.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.640
That was music to my gears.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.226
What a great idea, Otis.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.396
Looks like we might be able
to have this dance after all.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.648
It's going to be oink-cellent.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.652
Look at the moon.

08:06.278 --> 08:09.615
We need to get back
to the hayfield for our dance.

08:09.698 --> 08:13.285
-Let's get rolling.
-Right this way, folks.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.079
I can't wait to jump and spin.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.708
We're gonna have a dance tonight
We're gonna have a dance tonight

08:20.209 --> 08:22.669
-I wanna spin, spin, spin!
-I can't wait to dance.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.963
I'm going to shake my tail feathers.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.340
Whoo-moo!

08:26.423 --> 08:27.549
Right behind you.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.804
We've got the perfect spot
with lots of room for dancing.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.597
We've got the music.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.683
Now it's time to dance.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.727
You said it, Otis.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.612
Rusty, show everyone your special dance.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.114
It's a-moo-zing.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.701
A special dance? I want to see.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.037
Okay, folks.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.165
Now jump, jump, jump
Right off the grou--

09:04.962 --> 09:06.505
That's not gonna happen.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.341
But-- Then we...

09:10.133 --> 09:13.512
Spin, spin, spin
Go round and round

09:17.850 --> 09:18.934
Hit the brakes.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.104
Rusty, are you okay?

09:23.021 --> 09:26.817
Looks like I'm too creaky
and worn-out to do my dance.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.111
I'm so sad.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.241
You all go ahead. Dance without me.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.205
Rusty, please stay.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.500
We can't have a dance
without the most important thing.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.335
What's that?

09:45.419 --> 09:47.212
You, Rusty.

09:47.296 --> 09:51.758
That's very nice, Otis.
But if I can't jump or spin,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.136
I can't do my favorite dance.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.514
It's the same dance I always used to do.

09:59.349 --> 10:03.562
Maybe we can think of a new dance
that you can do now.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.440
Okay. Like what?

10:06.523 --> 10:10.152
Well, you're a great wiggler. Try this.

10:10.611 --> 10:14.239
Wiggle your front. Now wiggle your seat.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.659
Wiggle your front. Now wiggle your seat.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.246
Then thump your tires, hooves or feet.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.041
Then thump your tires, hooves or feet.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.419
Now, this is a dance that I can do.

10:27.503 --> 10:28.921
Thank you, Otis.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.298
You made me one happy tractor.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.093
Wiggle your front
Now wiggle your seat

10:35.177 --> 10:37.930
Then thump your tires, hooves or feet

10:38.013 --> 10:40.307
Wiggle your front
Now wiggle your seat

10:40.390 --> 10:43.143
Then thump your tires, hooves or feet

10:43.227 --> 10:45.479
Wiggle your front
Now wiggle your seat

10:45.562 --> 10:48.440
Then thump your tires, hooves or feet

10:48.524 --> 10:50.776
Wiggle your front
Then wiggle your seat

10:50.859 --> 10:53.403
Then thump your tires, hooves or feet

10:55.072 --> 10:56.281
All right!

10:58.992 --> 11:01.620
Hey, Otis. What's this dance called?

11:01.703 --> 11:04.873
It's called, "The Rusty."

11:04.957 --> 11:07.709
Do the Rusty, do the Rusty

11:11.672 --> 11:14.508
This is the best dance ever.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.887
And it wouldn't have happened
without your help, Otis.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.014
Thanks, Rusty.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.476
On this farm, we all help each other.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.436
We sure do, Otis.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.285
"The Bull Next Door."

11:48.375 --> 11:50.169
-Hi, Sal.
-Hey, Otis.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.258
Hey, chickens. I'm Charles.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.718
Do you want to see my ribbon?

12:01.138 --> 12:02.264
I guess not.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.728
Wow. What a nice ribbon, Charles.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.273
I've never seen something so shiny before.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.858
Thank you.

12:12.941 --> 12:17.529
And it's not just any ribbon.
It's the first-prize ribbon that I won.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.034
Oh, no, no, no!

12:22.117 --> 12:24.036
Not my ribbon.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.039
Come back, ribbon! Come back!

12:31.793 --> 12:33.921
Is the kite ready to fly, Sal?

12:36.798 --> 12:40.344
I think it's still missing something.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.305
Where did that come from?

12:43.388 --> 12:45.682
I don't know. But it's just what I need.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.977
Now my kite has a tail just like me.

12:49.728 --> 12:50.896
Ta-da!

12:52.272 --> 12:54.066
It's ready for takeoff.

12:54.149 --> 12:59.655
Without feather ado, here we go.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.494
It's flying!

13:05.577 --> 13:07.079
Look at it go!

13:07.913 --> 13:09.540
-Wow!
-Yeah!

13:10.958 --> 13:12.584
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:12.668 --> 13:14.169
Whoa, whoa, what?

13:14.253 --> 13:16.338
Look, it's a big bull.

13:21.552 --> 13:25.472
His long horns are kind of scary.

13:25.556 --> 13:28.183
Come on, Otis. Let's get away from here.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.145
Oh, no. Ribbon, where are you?

13:32.688 --> 13:33.856
Hit the brakes.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.191
He sounds upset.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.196
Hi. I'm Otis.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.489
Are you okay?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.741
I'm Charles.

13:45.450 --> 13:50.122
And I lost something really special,
and I'm worried I'll never get it back.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.751
Can I help you find it?

13:54.835 --> 13:58.422
I would... love that.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.840
What did you lose?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.843
I lost my first-prize ribbon.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.052
Have you seen it?

14:04.761 --> 14:06.889
Is it blue?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.307
Yes.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.558
And shiny?

14:09.641 --> 14:10.642
Yes!

14:12.811 --> 14:15.647
I think my friend Sal put it on his kite.

14:15.731 --> 14:18.400
Come on, let's get rolling to find him.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.111
Wait.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.075
There's just one problem.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.371
Right. The fence.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.498
But there must be a way over it.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.667
Over it? Yeah.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.170
Maybe I could jump over it.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.473
Oh, no. The fence is too high.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.518
There's no way I'm getting over it.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.812
I'll never get my first-prize ribbon back.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.065
I'm a hearty helper.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.151
There must be something
we can do to figure this out.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.280
Putt, puff, puttedy--

15:05.364 --> 15:06.448
Oops.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.370
That's it. Maybe we could use this wood--

15:11.453 --> 15:12.996
To build another fence?

15:13.497 --> 15:14.790
Not a fence.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.586
A bridge, so you can climb over.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.716
There we go. One on your side...

15:26.134 --> 15:28.011
and one on my side.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.639
Now just climb on over.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.142
Here goes nothing.

15:34.226 --> 15:37.396
One foot up like that. Careful.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.772
Go, Charles. Go!

15:41.191 --> 15:43.610
Hey, you did it, Otis.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.821
This bridge is just what I needed.

15:47.322 --> 15:51.201
I climbed up and down the bridge
I climbed up and down the bridge

15:51.285 --> 15:54.288
-Yeah!
-You made it.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.664
All thanks to you.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.417
You really are a hearty helper.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.710
Any time.

15:59.793 --> 16:03.463
Now let's go find Sal
and get your ribbon back.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.221
But where could it be?

16:11.305 --> 16:13.515
Your farm is so big.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.477
Ribbon! Ribbon!

16:19.605 --> 16:20.606
Look.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.402
Ribbon. There you are.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.029
Let's go get it back.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.367
What a day.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.454
A nice breeze, a beautiful kite,

16:35.537 --> 16:38.081
Otis being chased by a big bull.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.835
Otis being chased by a big bull?

16:41.919 --> 16:44.505
Oh, no. Oh, no. That bull got out.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.132
Otis! Behind you!

16:47.758 --> 16:50.427
The bull is chasing you!

16:50.928 --> 16:52.721
Sal, this is Charles.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.598
He wasn't chasing me.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.767
I was helping him get his ribbon back.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.981
Well, nice to meet you.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.358
The kite!

17:04.441 --> 17:06.443
Ruffle my feathers. The kite!

17:07.109 --> 17:08.862
And my first-prize ribbon.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.281
Come back, ribbon!

17:11.365 --> 17:13.200
Come back, kite.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.119
Now it's lost all over again.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.540
I loved that ribbon.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.626
And now it's gone forever.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.878
This is the saddest day ever.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.134
Sal and I
will help you get your ribbon back.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.512
-You will?
-We will?

17:33.595 --> 17:36.473
Yep. And your kite too, Sal.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.643
Yes. We can cock-a-doodle-do it.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.939
I promise you we will search high and low,

17:44.022 --> 17:46.358
from hilltop to hilltop.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.862
We will not stop till we find them!

17:52.364 --> 17:53.490
There they go.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.492
Well, that was easy.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.870
The hard part's going to be catching them.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.371
Let's get rolling.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.129
There it is!

18:08.005 --> 18:09.506
It's getting away!

18:10.132 --> 18:11.133
Oh, no!

18:13.427 --> 18:14.845
We can do this.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.097
There it goes.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.099
Faster!

18:19.725 --> 18:21.518
We're so close.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.814
I got you, ribbon.

18:33.572 --> 18:34.823
Did I get it?

18:34.907 --> 18:36.366
Almost.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.038
There it is!

18:41.121 --> 18:42.372
Come on, Sal.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.791
I got it.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.376
I really got it.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.047
This time I mean it!

18:52.216 --> 18:54.426
Did you see how close I was?

18:54.510 --> 18:57.346
Yeah. I know we can get it next time.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.557
There it goes.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.780
It's stuck in the tree.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.032
But how are we gonna get it?

19:19.493 --> 19:20.911
Like this.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.081
Here I go.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.000
Oh, horsefeathers.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.503
I can't flutter high enough.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.255
Nice try, Sal.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.881
Maybe I can reach it.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.596
I can't quite get it.

19:41.557 --> 19:44.184
There's no way
I'll get my ribbon back now.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.565
We'll think of a way
to get that kite down.

19:49.648 --> 19:52.442
But if I'm not big enough
to reach it, who is?

19:53.485 --> 19:54.820
He has a point.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.617
This is so disappointing.

20:03.203 --> 20:08.584
If none of us can reach it alone,
maybe we can try to reach it together.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.795
Sure, but how?

20:11.879 --> 20:14.339
Charles, climb onto my tire.

20:15.591 --> 20:16.925
Are you sure?

20:17.009 --> 20:21.346
If you can climb over the fence,
then you can climb onto my tire.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.520
I'm coming, ribbon!

20:29.563 --> 20:30.772
Can you reach it?

20:34.318 --> 20:35.777
It's still too far.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.574
Sal, can you hop on Charles?

20:40.657 --> 20:42.868
You bet your gears I can.

20:45.704 --> 20:48.040
Look how big I am.

20:52.503 --> 20:56.048
A little bit higher, please.

21:02.971 --> 21:08.060
I can't... quite... get it.

21:09.561 --> 21:12.814
Oh, no. The kite's gonna blow away.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.358
Hold on.

21:15.651 --> 21:19.029
I think I can get us a little higher.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.948
Keep going, Otis.

21:21.031 --> 21:24.409
Almost. Almost.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.537
I'm a hearty helper.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.999
And hearty helpers never give up.

21:34.503 --> 21:35.671
Got it!

21:36.255 --> 21:37.381
Ribbon!

21:37.464 --> 21:39.174
Farm-tastic!

21:39.716 --> 21:42.177
Wow, that was amazing.

21:42.261 --> 21:43.720
We did it!

21:45.848 --> 21:51.103
And now I can finally give back
your beautiful, shiny ribbon.

21:51.603 --> 21:52.896
Wait!

21:52.980 --> 21:57.025
Do you think
we could fly the kite together first?

21:57.109 --> 21:59.653
-You bet.
-Let's cock-a-doodle-do it.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.323
Ready?

22:03.407 --> 22:07.369
In three, two, one...

22:07.452 --> 22:09.079
takeoff!

22:13.750 --> 22:15.502
Look at my ribbon go.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.505
This is the best feeling ever.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.969
I never would have gotten it back
without your help, Otis.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.305
We all helped each other, Charles.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.183
That's what we do on our farm. Come on.
