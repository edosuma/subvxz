00:46.191 --> 00:47.995
Reputed crime boss Gaetano Chezere...

00:47.995 --> 00:50.535
Once again avoided prison
when a mistrial was declared

00:50.565 --> 00:52.735
today in his 8-week-long RICO prosecution.

00:54.511 --> 00:56.243
Allegedly responsible for over 200 murders,

00:56.516 --> 01:01.305
Chezere has yet to spend one day behind bars.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.805
Mr Eugene Gordlock, a witness that repeatedly
asked to be recused from the case

01:04.836 --> 01:08.306
was gunned down just a few hours earlier.

01:15.730 --> 01:19.934
Punisher - War Zone
(subs by MajorTJKong)

02:50.007 --> 02:51.337
The pained words of a grieving woman,

02:51.408 --> 02:54.808
left all alone in a city outraged 
by today's developments

02:55.909 --> 02:59.935
No concrete evidence of tampering, 
and with Mr Gordlock now dead...

03:43.156 --> 03:44.422
Do I fix your
make up for you?

03:48.134 --> 03:49.000
Come on.

03:53.648 --> 03:57.791
You know so, the captain should have
sent me out here with 30 or 40 men

03:57.791 --> 03:58.928
to raze this bloody get out of jail party.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.463
Instead I'm stuck here with you.

04:00.598 --> 04:01.931
He might come out tonight.

04:03.539 --> 04:05.840
As a matter of fact I'm
pretty sure he's going to show up.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.086
And what are you going to do?

04:09.086 --> 04:10.213
I'm going to bring him in.

04:11.993 --> 04:16.265
You know, you kill me so.
Let's just say you can make this happen.

04:16.437 --> 04:17.769
Why would you?

04:18.308 --> 04:22.052
He does to those bastard what
me and you can only fantasize about

04:22.252 --> 04:27.795
Hey, keep your nose clean.
-Yeah, sure thing pops.

04:36.822 --> 04:41.266
Hey, Okay now, I was just, uh...
Take it easy in there, ok?

04:41.326 --> 04:42.361
Nicky

04:42.401 --> 04:44.261
What am I going to do?

04:44.406 --> 04:46.602
Give the old guy a heart attack?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.427
Go on, beat it.
- Give me una minuto.

04:59.575 --> 05:01.569
You handled the witness situation...

05:01.815 --> 05:03.877
... perfectly.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.346
No sweat, Uncle G.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.549
You look great?

05:10.659 --> 05:13.777
The hell I do.
I shit in a bag for Christ's sake.

05:13.777 --> 05:16.511
Hey, it saves you a
trip to the can, right?

05:16.717 --> 05:19.121
You came to discuss a private matter.

05:20.192 --> 05:23.325
Down at the docks!
-Right yeah, Cristu Bulat.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.504
I hear he's a sick fucker...

05:25.673 --> 05:27.157
...fresh off the boat.

05:27.329 --> 05:29.671
Cristu's bringing in a shipment.
Needs a safe port.

05:29.916 --> 05:32.856
I've arranged for my custom's guy
Simmons to be on that night...

05:32.856 --> 05:35.624
The union boys will be there to unload
Our cut's 10 mil.

05:35.931 --> 05:37.058
We won't break a sweat.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.403
10 mil. What's Cristu's shipment?
-I don't know.

05:42.915 --> 05:47.255
Some kind of biological package.
-Biological package!

05:47.492 --> 05:49.190
I fucking knew it!

05:49.932 --> 05:52.461
Probably going up to
the rag heads in Queens.

05:52.705 --> 05:54.470
Cristu's guaranteed it's leaving the city.

05:54.710 --> 05:56.682
We don't touch that kind that shit!

05:56.882 --> 05:59.789
In case your memory is going along with
the rest of your bodily functions...

05:59.789 --> 06:02.387
... you might like to remember,
I'm the top earner around here.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.295
I'm not stupid.
- Stupido.

06:05.096 --> 06:07.696
You're as shithouse crazy as your brother,...

06:08.244 --> 06:09.901
...Loony Bin Jimmy.

06:10.983 --> 06:13.785
I should have had the
both of you locked away!

06:13.957 --> 06:16.588
One more word about my brother,
I swear to Christ I'll....

06:16.998 --> 06:19.630
You know what,
you make one move you greasy fuck!

06:19.838 --> 06:23.006
Hey, let's just all calm down here, ok.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.158
I put on a big spread out here,

06:28.158 --> 06:29.522
So come on boys.

06:29.795 --> 06:30.821
Eat up!

06:37.247 --> 06:39.719
I'm not fucking eating with that
shit bag. You understand?

06:40.355 --> 06:42.120
Pittzy, pour me a drink!

07:25.521 --> 07:26.721
Vaffanculo!

07:27.053 --> 07:28.412
What the fuck?

08:22.591 --> 08:23.891
Let's go!

08:59.092 --> 09:02.064
Alright, let's split up.
Shouldn't we wait for back up?

09:14.965 --> 09:17.165
Police! Freeze!

09:26.192 --> 09:28.292
Listen, Billy Russoti is getting away.

09:28.698 --> 09:29.831
The silver Rover.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.430
Might want to head out to the docks first.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.165
Shit! That hurt!

09:48.447 --> 09:49.415
What happen to you?

09:49.716 --> 09:53.556
Your Punisher. He disarmed me, held me at gunpoint
then he stole my damn ride.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.220
And where the hell were you, huh?

09:55.531 --> 09:58.134
I know he would come.
Let me get your statement.

09:59.173 --> 10:01.937
Come on, Cesare, tell me everything.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.449
How'd it go down? Huh?

11:28.891 --> 11:30.053
-muffled-

11:32.066 --> 11:33.865
Oh well. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

11:36.176 --> 11:39.240
It's time for me to take over
anyway, thanks to the Punisher!

11:39.417 --> 11:40.944
I won't even get my fucking hands dirty.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.693
There's your problem.

11:46.033 --> 11:47.862
What the fuck he doing here?
-Relax!

11:47.938 --> 11:49.097
I asked him to come.

11:50.745 --> 11:52.909
My man. How are you doing?

11:53.250 --> 11:54.480
Who the fuck are these fanooks?

11:54.687 --> 11:56.317
These are a couple of my colleagues.

11:57.294 --> 11:58.923
They are very very...

11:59.165 --> 12:02.263
...gifted deliverymen.
No mountain too high. No river...

12:02.974 --> 12:03.464
...too deep.

12:05.881 --> 12:07.681
Alright, alright...enough!

12:08.187 --> 12:09.212
Pittsy, get me some money.

12:09.591 --> 12:10.559
Time to go to work.

12:11.094 --> 12:12.154
Running a little low, boss.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.095
We just picked up 200K from
the Luciano Construction site.

12:15.338 --> 12:17.309
I had to launder it
through the Pussy Cat lounge

12:17.309 --> 12:18.835
Like you told me, remember?

12:19.518 --> 12:22.723
Well bring it back tomorrow.
- You got it boss.

12:22.723 --> 12:28.002
Here. That's 20 rolls of hundreds.
That's a grand each, all counted.

12:28.002 --> 12:30.338
Head for the port. Do your monkey thing.
Get over the security fence. Hand out the money.

12:33.716 --> 12:34.706
Hey, where the fuck you going?

12:34.919 --> 12:39.157
Will it be alright if
I took the roof instead of the door?

12:39.397 --> 12:39.921
Whatever.

12:40.132 --> 12:41.100
You're a fucking saint.

13:13.301 --> 13:14.501
Hey, what's the matter?

13:52.742 --> 13:53.402
Fuck!

13:53.578 --> 13:54.426
What the fuck with that?

13:54.476 --> 13:56.276
Agent down! Repeat, agent down! Fuck!

13:56.377 --> 13:57.577
I'll check it out boss.

14:12.792 --> 14:13.594
Pop!
-No, I'l take care of it.

14:13.634 --> 14:14.659
You get the guards!

14:15.732 --> 14:16.427
Pittsy!

14:31.236 --> 14:32.531
Fuck!
Fuck you Castle!

14:36.482 --> 14:37.040
Come on, Frank!

14:40.425 --> 14:42.696
Fuck you, Frank!
Fuck you Castle you fuckin...

14:59.070 --> 14:59.901
Pittsy! Pittsy!

15:01.102 --> 15:02.502
There he is!

15:53.971 --> 15:54.673
FBl, drop your weapons!

15:54.673 --> 15:55.504
Oh shit! Shit!

15:55.909 --> 15:56.774
You two, up the stairs.
The rest, behind me.

15:58.783 --> 15:59.341
Don't move!

15:59.993 --> 16:00.986
FBI

16:01.121 --> 16:02.016
Put your weapons down!

18:01.117 --> 18:03.017
We got a live one!

18:05.391 --> 18:06.257
Billy the Beaut!

18:09.201 --> 18:09.930
Not anymore, eh?

18:14.133 --> 18:15.801
Wait a minute.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.309
The Lord is compassion and love.

18:26.309 --> 18:28.975
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

18:30.085 --> 18:34.825
He does not treat us according to our sin,
nor repay us according to our faults

18:36.634 --> 18:38.605
As parents have compassion on their children

18:39.107 --> 18:42.080
The Lord had pity of those here.

18:42.349 --> 18:46.689
For he know of what we are made.
He remembers that we are dust

18:48.029 --> 18:50.398
And for us, our days are like grass.

18:51.303 --> 18:54.277
We flower like a flower in a field.

18:54.277 --> 18:59.848
The wind blows and we are gone,
and our place never sees us again.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.283
I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

19:24.617 --> 19:26.053
Who compromised Donatelli?

19:26.255 --> 19:28.727
Calm down Budiansky.
It wasn't anybody's fault.

19:28.727 --> 19:32.269
None of us could have foreseen Frank Castle
opening up hunting season on La Cosa Nostra.

19:32.269 --> 19:33.169
Come on!

19:33.607 --> 19:36.029
Look, Donatelli sent us a message.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.363
He said something big is going to happen.

19:38.418 --> 19:42.061
He asked for Homeland Security. We've
been running 24 hours surveillance on Russoti.

19:42.061 --> 19:44.199
And just as we were about to find
out what the fuck is happening,

19:44.199 --> 19:46.103
Donatelli got shot
believe me!

19:46.103 --> 19:47.841
No one's more pissed off about it than I am!

19:47.841 --> 19:50.414
How is it we are not all over Frank Castle?

19:50.414 --> 19:53.923
Because we have real National Security
threat, and the last time I checked

19:53.923 --> 19:56.394
that tops trying to stop some
crazed vigilante.

19:57.532 --> 19:58.329
Go!

20:03.145 --> 20:05.239
Hey.
- Hey.

20:06.387 --> 20:07.947
I'm going to get this guy Angie.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.627
I promise you.

21:48.402 --> 21:50.469
I heard the Bureau
was sending a baby sitter.

21:50.908 --> 21:53.175
A liaison.
-Thirty years on the force.

21:53.949 --> 21:55.816
I still don't know what that word means.

21:55.987 --> 21:59.154
We have a certain way of doing
things around here, Special Agent Budiansky.

21:59.663 --> 22:02.100
Like letting mass murderers run free?

22:02.570 --> 22:05.270
4 years, this Punisher
has been wreaking havoc.

22:06.178 --> 22:08.317
And you haven't once caught a break.

22:08.317 --> 22:10.117
I'm always deep in shit
around here as you can plainly see.

22:12.962 --> 22:15.992
Your buddies from the Bureau told me
the city is under some kind of terror threat

22:17.640 --> 22:20.807
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive
about that if you know what I mean.

22:21.082 --> 22:24.921
I've got all my men trying to find out what
your late colleague came across when he went under.

22:25.792 --> 22:31.440
Maybe if you Feds allowed us lowly cops
in on your undercover operations once in a while

22:31.440 --> 22:32.944
all of this could have been avoided.

22:33.004 --> 22:35.610
With all due respect, Captain,...

22:37.087 --> 22:38.713
that, is bullshit!

22:39.359 --> 22:41.598
What if it had been your man lying there, huh?

22:41.598 --> 22:43.626
in a pool of his own blood?

22:44.706 --> 22:50.018
You crispy crème mother fuckers
would be beating down every door in the city

22:50.018 --> 22:53.049
Captain. Captain, You know what?

22:53.695 --> 22:57.899
The Punisher task force could
use an extra man.

23:03.719 --> 23:05.382
Room 12,

23:06.525 --> 23:07.117
The basement.

23:25.906 --> 23:29.905
Ah, Agent Budiansky?
Did I get that right?

23:30.383 --> 23:32.354
Captain told me you were coming in.

23:33.658 --> 23:35.424
Welcome to the Punisher task force.

23:35.697 --> 23:38.169
I'm Detective Martin Soap.
Pleasure.

23:39.473 --> 23:44.041
Make yourself at home.
-You have a degree in behavioral psychology

23:44.585 --> 23:48.618
Surprised?
That's okay, most people are.

23:50.767 --> 23:53.331
So, what do you actually do here?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.935
Here?
- Uh huh.

23:55.995 --> 23:57.422
This is ground zero.

23:58.786 --> 24:01.350
I shadowed his every step for the last five years.

24:02.328 --> 24:06.270
I've documented every murder that fit his profile.

24:06.506 --> 24:09.536
I've collected intelligence on all known associates.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.812
Take the look at this.

24:14.090 --> 24:15.617
Six years ago,

24:15.861 --> 24:18.298
Frank Castle was a
Special Forces instructor

24:21.040 --> 24:26.315
And a simple family man. One day
he takes his wife and kids for a picnic

24:26.788 --> 24:30.388
And by chance or fate,
depending on which you believe in,

24:30.798 --> 24:32.894
they witnessed a mob execution.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.101
When they were discovered.

24:38.550 --> 24:40.612
Castle survived.

24:43.161 --> 24:47.331
Since then, he's been taking down
one crime family after another.

24:51.314 --> 24:53.912
I'm really close, Budiansky

24:54.388 --> 24:57.122
The only thing getting
in my way is some bad luck.

24:58.733 --> 25:00.931
But I have a feeling
that's about to change.

25:02.308 --> 25:04.245
You know, I've
been waiting for someone like you.

25:06.385 --> 25:08.184
Take a look at some of the case files.

25:08.390 --> 25:12.730
Get the lay of land. I'll get us a pie
from Melanos. Best pizza in the city

25:13.034 --> 25:15.404
With drawer?
-What?

25:15.573 --> 25:17.601
The alleged Punisher murders.

25:19.316 --> 25:20.751
All of them.

25:58.578 --> 26:00.082
What do you want, Micro?

26:00.082 --> 26:03.290
You ever heard of Jahadiblogger.com?

26:03.290 --> 26:07.926
I'm posing as a one-arm Wahabi warrior
who took a crap in a cave next to bin Laden.

26:08.269 --> 26:11.042
I think I can score you a couple of rocket launchers.

26:11.042 --> 26:12.568
What do you want?

26:14.149 --> 26:15.676
I haven't seen you in a while.

26:18.259 --> 26:21.859
I brought you some treats.
It's gun show season in Virginia

26:22.169 --> 26:23.900
No background checks, no problems.

26:28.485 --> 26:29.621
That's too much Frank.

26:29.621 --> 26:32.092
Call it a retirement package.

26:34.332 --> 26:38.571
Look I know this thing with the Fed is eating you
up inside but that doesn't mean that you pack up your tent.

26:38.610 --> 26:40.603
We all make the mistakes Frank.

26:40.781 --> 26:42.152
You are fighting a war...

26:42.152 --> 26:46.595
against the assholes who slip through
the raindrops. Who get away with it.

26:46.595 --> 26:49.124
In any war there is collateral damage.
You know that.

26:49.636 --> 26:51.539
Collateral damage?

26:56.620 --> 26:59.855
I killed an agent in the field.
One of the good guys.

27:01.866 --> 27:03.530
He had a family.

27:04.031 --> 27:05.331
You didn't know.

27:07.948 --> 27:09.782
I fucked up Micro.

27:12.559 --> 27:15.258
Now please, just leave me alone.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.146
Where the fuck is Nicky?

27:37.085 --> 27:41.425
He didn't make it.
-Nicky was a fucking rat.

27:41.797 --> 27:43.130
For the Feds.

27:45.138 --> 27:46.699
What about my money?

27:48.413 --> 27:50.350
We already went
to his place and tore it apart.

27:50.786 --> 27:52.722
No sign of the safety deposit key or nothing.

27:53.325 --> 27:54.989
Does he got any next of kin?

27:55.296 --> 27:57.928
Somebody to carry
on the family name?

27:58.143 --> 28:00.897
Yeah. Paper said something
about a wife and a little girl.

28:01.144 --> 28:04.441
Good. Let's look there.
- You got it.

28:05.722 --> 28:08.161
Hey, Buck! Where you been?

28:08.161 --> 28:09.758
Am I glad to see you.
- Hi Billy.

28:09.808 --> 28:12.873
You should have seen those
fucking brashules at the clinic.

28:12.973 --> 28:16.003
They must have bought their
fucking degrees off of the internet.

28:16.347 --> 28:18.018
How the heck did you end up at a free clinic?

28:18.018 --> 28:20.357
Insurance said I missed a payment.

28:20.357 --> 28:22.162
Can you fucking believe that?

28:22.162 --> 28:25.871
Yeah, before we do this,
I need you to understand.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.042
The severity of your injuries
when you arrived here.

28:28.042 --> 28:30.649
Statistically speaking you
shouldn't have been able to survive this.

28:30.649 --> 28:32.754
Well that's why I'm here, Doc.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.628
I have the best plastic surgeon
in all of New York.

28:35.628 --> 28:42.076
Your facial muscles, tendons,
bone structure, everything - it was destroyed.

28:42.076 --> 28:44.316
There wasn't a single
square inch of skin

28:44.316 --> 28:45.452
left intact.

28:45.452 --> 28:48.091
Just take it off already.

28:48.091 --> 28:50.723
Ok, let's do this.

28:52.536 --> 28:55.338
Now I need you to sit
forward a little bit.

28:55.543 --> 28:56.636
Alright.

29:00.422 --> 29:01.891
Ok!

29:04.392 --> 29:05.592
Polymers

29:11.248 --> 29:14.279
strategically placed alloy plates,

29:16.628 --> 29:20.034
And just a little bit of horse hide.

29:20.135 --> 29:21.235
A little what?

29:34.572 --> 29:36.338
I need to talk to my doctor alone.

29:37.378 --> 29:38.745
Yeah, of course, Billy.

29:44.462 --> 29:46.100
What the fuck's the matter with you?

29:46.100 --> 29:47.737
You can't fuckin' control yourself?

29:47.737 --> 29:49.842
You know how sensitive
he is about his looks.

29:49.842 --> 29:54.752
Sorry Pops, it's just that I've never
seen anything so...  -Just shut the fuck up!

30:22.790 --> 30:24.259
You ok boss?

30:24.527 --> 30:26.087
Much better, thanks.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.426
I'll be in the car.

30:51.292 --> 30:52.729
No more distractions.

30:52.729 --> 30:54.533
We need to focus on my goals.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.002
One.

30:57.039 --> 30:58.633
We need to get my money back.

30:58.878 --> 31:01.049
Two. We gonna get rid of Frank Castle.

31:01.049 --> 31:02.853
Well...

31:02.853 --> 31:04.357
He took out like 30 of us. I mean-

31:04.357 --> 31:07.698
How are we gonna kill him
before he'll kill us?

31:07.698 --> 31:09.235
My brother will take care of that.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.469
Loony Bin Jim?
-Shut the fuck up.

31:12.009 --> 31:14.379
His name is James.

31:14.582 --> 31:16.420
Not Loony Bin Jim.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.762
Not LBJ, James.
-I'm sorry.

31:19.762 --> 31:22.929
It was a good idea Really, It is.

31:24.039 --> 31:25.208
Don't mind him.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.046
He doesn't think before he talks.

31:27.046 --> 31:29.117
Just like his mother.

31:29.117 --> 31:31.223
Sorry about that Billy.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.528
Billy is dead.

31:33.528 --> 31:38.234
From now on, you call me Jigsaw.

33:07.758 --> 33:10.629
How are we doing today,
Loony Bin Jim?

33:23.129 --> 33:25.123
Yummy yummy.

33:29.612 --> 33:31.582
So good.

33:35.159 --> 33:35.827
What?

33:35.827 --> 33:37.464
Doctor Basner. Open up.

33:37.464 --> 33:38.956
Yes, doctor.

33:58.749 --> 34:00.275
Billy?

34:00.687 --> 34:02.385
Is that you?

34:05.666 --> 34:06.861
It is.

34:07.604 --> 34:10.543
You look fantastic, brother.

34:16.659 --> 34:19.496
Ink, cut these off. Now.

34:20.335 --> 34:23.364
Pittsy, go open the doors of every other cell.

34:23.576 --> 34:25.347
Lead everybody out at the front door.

34:25.347 --> 34:28.377
Sure thing, Billy... Jigsaw.

34:29.992 --> 34:31.757
I'll take care of this guy.

34:31.929 --> 34:36.931
Oh no brother. Fatso is mine.

34:37.610 --> 34:39.012
Of course.

34:42.088 --> 34:45.654
I'm gonna get my apple sauce back.

34:46.065 --> 34:47.802
Did you know...

34:47.802 --> 34:52.803
Kidneys in apple sauce are
a delicacy in Sweden?

34:54.351 --> 34:57.815
Did you know that? Yes.

34:59.430 --> 35:05.138
Yummy yummy yummy,
in my tummy tummy tummy.

35:13.899 --> 35:15.493
What do ya say boss?

35:15.737 --> 35:17.106
Stuff might come in handy.

35:17.106 --> 35:18.176
What for?

35:18.176 --> 35:22.016
Well, in case he starts,
you know, not feeling so good.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.701
He's doing just great.

36:03.654 --> 36:05.123
You're in my light.

36:17.020 --> 36:20.552
For the next time someone
gets in your light.

36:29.350 --> 36:31.387
Stay the fuck away from my little girl.

36:31.387 --> 36:34.657
Mom! That's a bad word.
-Go inside, Grace.

36:39.474 --> 36:42.812
You're messing with the wrong family
on the wrong day, asshole.

36:46.157 --> 36:48.891
You... You are...

36:50.100 --> 36:51.738
What are you doing here?

36:51.738 --> 36:54.043
What makes you think you can come here?

36:54.043 --> 36:56.416
You scared the girl.
-Shut up.

36:56.416 --> 36:58.352
Just shut your mouth.

36:59.858 --> 37:02.022
I'm sorry.
-I said shut up.

37:05.137 --> 37:06.731
What's this?

37:07.042 --> 37:10.140
Something to help out.
-No.

37:10.985 --> 37:12.921
No, you don't get to do that.

37:13.157 --> 37:16.064
You don't get to shoot my husband
in cold blood...

37:16.064 --> 37:17.400
and did stuff with the ATM.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.894
It's for your daughter.

37:20.074 --> 37:22.136
This is what you deserve.

37:23.181 --> 37:25.619
What you did to Nicky.

37:29.396 --> 37:31.663
Who punishes you?

37:34.274 --> 37:36.142
He taught you how to shoot.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.781
Good agent keeps his family safe.

37:40.189 --> 37:41.886
He couldn't always be here.

37:44.633 --> 37:46.467
Took the out to the range.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.641
Showed you what to do.

37:52.018 --> 37:54.251
This... is where you do it.

37:57.632 --> 37:59.261
Squeeze.

37:59.870 --> 38:01.362
Don't pull.

38:12.401 --> 38:14.839
I can't find my red pen.

38:18.416 --> 38:20.683
Mom? I need it.

38:27.270 --> 38:28.900
Take it.

39:13.115 --> 39:15.345
Is this it boss?
- Yeah.

39:15.688 --> 39:17.180
Nice brother.

39:17.693 --> 39:19.431
Is it yours?

39:19.431 --> 39:20.100
Not yet.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.731
Ol' Cesare used to
rent it to screw hookers

39:23.374 --> 39:26.313
Let's go inside before I freeze
my fucking balls off.

39:44.559 --> 39:46.290
What's the matter, Billy?

39:47.266 --> 39:52.472
Just when I think I'm Ok
I see my reflection somewhere and ...

39:54.450 --> 39:56.250
I look horrible.

39:58.726 --> 40:00.663
What has he done to me?

40:01.266 --> 40:05.577
Oh no... don't cry, brother.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.317
Everything is gonna be alright.

40:08.317 --> 40:11.558
I promise you two things.

40:11.558 --> 40:15.601
One, I will find Castle and
I will kill him.

40:15.601 --> 40:18.942
Slowly and painfully.

40:18.942 --> 40:26.127
And two, you will never ever have to
look at your reflection again,

40:26.127 --> 40:28.496
as long as you're with me.

41:30.050 --> 41:33.785
- Speaking in Russian -

41:35.963 --> 41:38.367
You're not in Transylvania anymore Cristu.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.975
We don't talk vampire.

41:40.975 --> 41:43.915
It's Russian,...

41:45.554 --> 41:48.127
My men is concerned.

41:48.127 --> 41:50.759
If Punisher can do this to your face,

41:51.569 --> 41:53.807
what might he do to our deal?

41:53.807 --> 41:57.509
The tongue stretches further than
most people think.

41:57.851 --> 42:01.257
Ask your man how he's gonna talk
that shit,

42:01.526 --> 42:03.498
when I pull it from his mouth.

42:03.498 --> 42:05.024
Or you'll what?

42:06.271 --> 42:07.875
Enough!

42:07.875 --> 42:09.980
The Punisher is not a problem.

42:09.980 --> 42:11.848
The docks are mine.

42:12.453 --> 42:14.788
My looks have nothing to do with this.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.358
Everybody.

42:17.532 --> 42:20.836
From local security to international
customs is in my pocket.

42:21.542 --> 42:25.882
Quite frankly. This job doesn't get done
without me.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.782
What do you think?

42:29.594 --> 42:32.762
It seems he is right.

42:33.237 --> 42:34.968
We do not need monster.

42:39.117 --> 42:40.586
Shit!

42:50.378 --> 42:52.315
Stop!

43:06.919 --> 43:09.859
My most sincere apologies.

43:09.859 --> 43:13.562
My father always say never insult
your host.

43:14.137 --> 43:16.574
Sounds like a reasonable man.

43:17.110 --> 43:18.944
You don't know my father.

43:26.767 --> 43:28.327
Three days.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.970
It has to be 12 million.

43:33.985 --> 43:36.924
We agreed on 10.
- We both know ...

43:37.093 --> 43:41.126
that this biological shit you're
bringing in isn't leaving the city.

43:42.071 --> 43:45.813
You're selling it to the ragheads
in Queens.

43:45.813 --> 43:48.453
The ports been crawling with suits
from Homeland.

43:48.453 --> 43:51.689
It's going to take a lot of payola
to keep it quiet.

44:02.120 --> 44:05.391
I always knew you'd be a good boss, Billy

44:05.592 --> 44:06.992
Thanks brother.

44:49.169 --> 44:50.661
Latin kings.

44:51.006 --> 44:53.244
Let him go, Frank.

44:53.244 --> 44:55.249
You know this piece of shit?

44:55.249 --> 44:57.783
Ex piece of shit.
-Yeah.

44:58.291 --> 45:00.296
He's a regular choir boy.

45:00.426 --> 45:02.379
Fuck you, cracker.
-Language!

45:02.509 --> 45:04.038
It's a genius racket.

45:04.158 --> 45:06.876
You know how the cops are
always running those guns buy backs?

45:06.976 --> 45:08.748
Except they never work.

45:08.864 --> 45:12.481
Because what banger
is gonna trust a cop, right?

45:13.595 --> 45:17.203
Well, these drive by whack jobs,
they just love Carlos here.

45:17.203 --> 45:21.509
They get one look at that lnk,
and they know he's for real.

45:21.680 --> 45:25.624
We get the guns of the streets to you

45:25.624 --> 45:29.496
Never once seen a banger that could quit.
Too fucking stupid.

45:31.672 --> 45:32.902
He's straight, Frank.

45:34.612 --> 45:38.348
Hey ma! Frank's here.
He says eat up.

45:40.226 --> 45:41.752
How is she doing?

45:42.531 --> 45:44.403
Yeah well...

45:44.403 --> 45:48.209
As long as she's got her cooking shows,
she's good.

45:49.716 --> 45:51.413
It's the only thing she notices.

45:51.620 --> 45:53.785
But hey that's something, right?

45:57.601 --> 45:58.193
Listen. I-

45:59.873 --> 46:02.779
I just came around to tell you I'm
going out of town for a while.

46:03.450 --> 46:03.973
Out of town?

46:09.030 --> 46:11.102
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:11.102 --> 46:15.272
I never thought of the Punisher, you know
taking a long weekend.

46:15.479 --> 46:17.382
I'm not planning on coming back.

46:18.486 --> 46:21.418
So I take it things didn't go so well
at the Donatelli home.

46:23.264 --> 46:25.132
Are you aware that Billy Russoti survived?

46:27.374 --> 46:28.570
I heard.

46:30.014 --> 46:32.821
Let the cops take care of him.

46:32.841 --> 46:35.310
You and I know they got nothing on him.

46:35.326 --> 46:36.663
Their hands are tied.

46:36.663 --> 46:38.335
This is where the Punisher comes in.

46:38.385 --> 46:41.533
This is why I believe in you.
Why I've supported you all these years.

46:41.575 --> 46:43.145
You want me to tell you when
something happens to...

46:43.185 --> 46:44.645
Mrs. Donatelli and her daughter?

46:44.715 --> 46:46.855
Because that's what's gonna happen.

46:46.895 --> 46:48.793
You don't think he's gonna go
for revenge?

46:48.803 --> 46:51.153
It's not a question of if.
it's just a matter of when.

47:02.025 --> 47:04.155
Pull a couple of Berettas.
-For what?

47:07.036 --> 47:09.768
3, 2, 1

47:13.854 --> 47:15.792
Russoti is the last one.

47:15.992 --> 47:16.927
Then I'm done.

47:17.027 --> 47:18.532
For your own lips to God's ears.

47:18.602 --> 47:19.802
You know where I can find him.

47:19.862 --> 47:21.974
I don't have a fix on him.

47:21.974 --> 47:24.915
You wiped out all of his associates
that are known to me.

47:24.915 --> 47:27.655
I saw him with some new guys.
The leader was black.

47:27.655 --> 47:29.091
Dreadlocks.

47:29.191 --> 47:31.425
Doing some kind of acrobatic
stuff over the roofs.

47:31.475 --> 47:33.769
That's Maginty and his
Urban Freeflow Gang.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.507
He's a mean motherfucker.

47:35.507 --> 47:37.607
He's on a constant meth high.

47:45.395 --> 47:46.598
Well come on.

47:46.867 --> 47:49.038
You want to find this guy or not?

47:52.882 --> 47:54.682
You boys play nice.

48:04.110 --> 48:05.714
I've been looking for you.

48:05.714 --> 48:08.151
Agent Budiansky. Take a load off.

48:08.251 --> 48:09.857
I need to go see Castle.

48:09.957 --> 48:12.698
Where do I find him?
-Brats, you know.

48:12.798 --> 48:13.490
He just left.

48:14.936 --> 48:16.667
Wait...

48:17.142 --> 48:18.304
You know what I like to do.

48:18.512 --> 48:24.790
I like to sit in my car and listen
to the CB Radio and follow the crime.

48:26.699 --> 48:28.202
I might just run into him.

48:28.202 --> 48:30.207
It's never worked for me
in five years now.

48:30.207 --> 48:33.180
But I'm not the luckiest guy
on the planet, you know.

48:49.053 --> 48:50.853
Let's get through the back door.

49:07.765 --> 49:10.465
Maginty and his boys are planning to hit
a convenience store of 45th and 2nd.

49:27.854 --> 49:29.616
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

49:29.796 --> 49:32.912
I repeat.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

49:33.893 --> 49:35.021
Let's do this.

49:36.966 --> 49:37.904
Really?

49:38.573 --> 49:39.967
Just drive the car.

49:41.515 --> 49:43.986
Come on! Run!

50:18.001 --> 50:19.203
Oh fuck!

50:34.613 --> 50:35.813
Please

50:36.014 --> 50:37.350
Don't kill me.

50:37.350 --> 50:39.555
Russoti, where is he?

50:39.555 --> 50:41.993
Yeah Jigsaw, I was just with him.

50:42.095 --> 50:44.367
He was suppose to give us some
dope for a job.

50:44.367 --> 50:45.961
But it turns out...

50:47.307 --> 50:49.210
He don't have any anymore.

50:49.446 --> 50:53.388
He forgot. He botched it.
He be a bastard.

50:54.024 --> 50:56.931
So you wanna go see him,
you need to tell him this,

50:56.931 --> 50:58.663
Wee bitch. Take it back.

51:00.239 --> 51:05.013
So tell him, for something,
Mr. Punisher, sir.

51:08.793 --> 51:12.202
So when did Donatelli
go undercover?

51:12.202 --> 51:14.340
We were partners in narcotics.

51:14.340 --> 51:15.477
Unfortunately,

51:15.537 --> 51:17.538
most of the blow we confiscated.

51:17.588 --> 51:18.912
ended up in my nose.

51:19.585 --> 51:22.060
Internal Affairs tried to
get Nicky to rat me out.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.327
He wouldn't.

51:23.387 --> 51:25.596
So, they sent him undercover.

51:27.339 --> 51:29.572
He's dead because of me.

51:32.585 --> 51:34.384
So you still skiing the old Alps?

51:36.494 --> 51:38.491
No. That's in the past.

51:43.577 --> 51:45.471
Holy shit!

51:56.878 --> 51:59.578
I'm getting out.
You meet me on the other side.

52:27.519 --> 52:28.145
Boo.

52:29.390 --> 52:31.258
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

52:31.629 --> 52:32.999
Or will you be calling
yourself 'miss' from now on.

52:32.999 --> 52:35.605
What do you want from us?

52:35.605 --> 52:37.677
I'm looking for my money.

52:37.677 --> 52:39.648
Which your rat of a husband
stole from me.

52:39.748 --> 52:41.740
But we don't have it. I swear to God.

52:45.830 --> 52:47.601
How about you, sweet cheeks?

52:47.601 --> 52:50.372
Would you also like to swear
on an imaginary friend?

52:53.382 --> 52:55.320
Make sure they don't move.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.718
I'll look for the money.
-Come here kid.

53:02.337 --> 53:03.607
Freeze, asshole.

53:03.807 --> 53:05.871
You're under arrest.

53:23.221 --> 53:25.124
Stay out of my way.

54:16.618 --> 54:17.787
Listen to me.

54:17.847 --> 54:21.121
Russoti is headed to the Donatelli house.

54:21.225 --> 54:22.961
He's probably already there.

54:24.037 --> 54:26.007
You have to let me go.

54:26.007 --> 54:28.673
You have the right to shut the fuck up.

55:25.386 --> 55:27.825
Good evening, officers.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.031
Is everything Ok in there?

55:30.031 --> 55:34.907
No. Everything is not Ok.
Follow me.

55:43.931 --> 55:46.129
Officer.

55:46.470 --> 55:49.102
No you don't!

56:03.077 --> 56:05.082
Well...

56:05.082 --> 56:08.318
This day was about to come sooner
or later, wasn't it?

56:09.661 --> 56:12.793
Have you heard back from the patrol car?

56:14.840 --> 56:16.310
So...

56:16.310 --> 56:17.574
I tried it a couple times.

56:19.016 --> 56:20.349
There was no answer.

56:29.408 --> 56:30.177
Listen.

56:30.177 --> 56:32.945
We gotta get out of here before
more pigs arrive.

56:34.822 --> 56:36.292
Where is my fuckin' money?

56:36.292 --> 56:38.329
My husband has a safe upstairs
in the bedroom.

56:38.505 --> 56:40.970
I don't know if it's there but
I can give you the combination.

56:40.970 --> 56:42.964
10-12-1965

56:43.342 --> 56:45.114
Oh how cute.

56:45.114 --> 56:47.312
Is that your dead husband's birthday?

56:58.814 --> 57:01.342
Let me out here.

57:07.903 --> 57:10.033
Get him to the station.
-You bet.

57:28.252 --> 57:29.210
Let me out.

57:31.524 --> 57:33.464
You know, Frank.

57:33.464 --> 57:36.029
Throwing your tip now and then
is one thing.

57:36.104 --> 57:39.871
Password to the crime database, sure,
but letting you go, so-

57:41.151 --> 57:42.049
Fine.

57:54.015 --> 57:55.348
How you doing?

58:09.720 --> 58:12.123
19.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.544
What was that?

58:36.418 --> 58:37.176
Go check it out.

58:39.993 --> 58:42.296
What the fuck you waiting for? Christmas?

59:10.635 --> 59:11.069
Now.

59:11.069 --> 59:13.240
Now, you sit down.

59:22.363 --> 59:23.023
I'm calling this in.

59:24.235 --> 59:24.998
Put your hands behind your back.

59:29.414 --> 59:31.782
Goddamnit you asshole!

59:33.424 --> 59:35.292
Where do you think you're going?

59:36.697 --> 59:38.695
Hands up!

59:42.847 --> 59:44.340
I repeat,
Request immediate back up.

59:52.669 --> 59:54.976
Don't worry. I'm here.

59:54.976 --> 59:56.844
Give me your fucking gun.

01:00:01.493 --> 01:00:03.828
Stay right where you fucking are.

01:00:07.674 --> 01:00:08.140
We did it, Budiansky, huh?

01:00:09.913 --> 01:00:11.812
You mind explaining it to me...

01:00:11.918 --> 01:00:15.527
how a handcuffed criminal escapes custody
the back of your locked car?

01:00:15.937 --> 01:00:19.259
The Castle is a slippery one.

01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:34.530
You'll be safe here.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:36.576
We can manage on our own.

01:00:36.718 --> 01:00:38.279
Just until we know Russoti's
been arrested.

01:00:43.228 --> 01:00:45.633
Grace.

01:00:45.633 --> 01:00:47.901
Grace, you listen, honey.

01:00:49.443 --> 01:00:50.969
She's smart.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.852
Go ahead. Open it.

01:01:25.531 --> 01:01:27.194
It... belonged to my daughter.

01:01:29.874 --> 01:01:30.503
Here.

01:01:37.526 --> 01:01:39.789
Wow!

01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:55.290
Put that down, honey.

01:01:57.442 --> 01:02:03.957
This was... Lisa's favorite toy.

01:02:03.957 --> 01:02:07.299
She got so angry when her little
brother used to hide it from her.

01:02:07.299 --> 01:02:11.070
Does she care if I play with it?

01:02:11.443 --> 01:02:13.778
No.

01:02:32.093 --> 01:02:35.032
You gonna fry for killing
two of my officers, Billy.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.230
I want a lawyer.
- Oh, you'll get your fucking lawyer.

01:02:38.977 --> 01:02:40.947
No lawyer's going to get
you out of this one.

01:02:41.282 --> 01:02:43.219
Lousy piece of shit.

01:03:00.896 --> 01:03:03.970
Agent Miller.
What are you doing here?

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.006
Russoti.

01:03:05.006 --> 01:03:06.811
What's he gotta do with the Bureau?

01:03:06.861 --> 01:03:08.180
The case Donatelli was
working on.

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.882
He says he got some intel to
make a deal for.

01:03:12.057 --> 01:03:13.293
Anyone know where he is right now?

01:03:13.293 --> 01:03:15.198
They just brought him
into the observation room.

01:03:15.198 --> 01:03:15.962
Good.

01:03:19.073 --> 01:03:19.942
Yeah.

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:21.814
Captain Ross. Agent Miller with the Bureau.

01:03:21.834 --> 01:03:25.282
I believe you've been informed
I'll be taking over this.

01:03:27.662 --> 01:03:31.104
This perp killed two of my officers.

01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:34.344
And terrorized a widow and child
of one of your agents.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:35.974
You keep that in mind, Miller.

01:03:41.763 --> 01:03:45.004
You're lucky I came to you with this.

01:03:45.004 --> 01:03:47.841
But then I'm a patriot just like you.

01:03:49.348 --> 01:03:51.085
I shit red white and blue.

01:03:51.085 --> 01:03:52.723
The reason you came to me is
because you got caught.

01:03:52.723 --> 01:03:56.131
So don't insult my intelligence, Ok?

01:03:56.131 --> 01:03:57.333
You tell me what you know.

01:03:57.363 --> 01:03:59.339
If it's any good,

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:02.176
I'll recommend life without parole.

01:04:03.515 --> 01:04:06.044
This deal is going down tonight?

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:12.067
I know when and I know where.

01:04:12.471 --> 01:04:18.076
So you're gonna give me and my brother
the immunity and the money.

01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:20.847
Or you're gonna have to explain
to Wolf fucking Blitzer...

01:04:22.061 --> 01:04:26.471
why you had a lead on the thing
that killed half of the fucking city,

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:28.705
and you didn't do
a goddamn thing about it.

01:04:33.455 --> 01:04:35.527
I'll be right back.

01:04:35.527 --> 01:04:37.532
Oh and Miller.

01:04:37.532 --> 01:04:39.298
Just that one other little thing.

01:05:42.931 --> 01:05:44.631
Wow!

01:05:45.732 --> 01:05:47.292
Happy?

01:06:02.238 --> 01:06:04.437
Shit! You bastard.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.515
You're fucking dead men.

01:06:06.615 --> 01:06:08.883
My father will kill you.
Hear me?

01:06:09.723 --> 01:06:12.389
My father will serve your head
on a fucking silver platter!

01:06:17.777 --> 01:06:19.406
Agent Miller.

01:06:19.715 --> 01:06:21.252
It's agreed.

01:06:21.252 --> 01:06:23.154
The other conditions of our agreement?

01:06:24.526 --> 01:06:26.497
Clear the area.

01:06:28.102 --> 01:06:31.802
I hope to God he finds you,
and you get what you deserve.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.130
How long was l-

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.635
A long time.

01:06:55.635 --> 01:06:56.905
You should eat.

01:06:56.905 --> 01:06:58.542
Yuck!
-Grace.

01:06:58.542 --> 01:06:59.578
What is it?

01:06:59.578 --> 01:07:01.450
Egg and cheese MREs.

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:02.318
That's all I have.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.789
What's an MRE?

01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:06.796
Meal. Ready to eat.

01:07:06.796 --> 01:07:07.964
Military food.

01:07:08.014 --> 01:07:10.439
It's great for people who can't cook.

01:07:10.439 --> 01:07:13.810
Look, Grace.
This is gonna come with chuckles.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.383
It's the best one I got.

01:07:16.553 --> 01:07:17.989
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.

01:07:17.989 --> 01:07:20.689
Out of practice.

01:07:22.301 --> 01:07:25.833
Not one more step.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:32.759
Where's Micro?

01:07:32.809 --> 01:07:33.860
His mother isn't feeling well.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:34.930
He didn't want to leave her.

01:07:34.945 --> 01:07:35.665
Damn it.

01:07:35.695 --> 01:07:38.002
I need to talk to him.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.308
This is Carlos.

01:07:39.308 --> 01:07:42.247
He's... a friend of mine.

01:07:43.652 --> 01:07:46.524
He's gonna hang while I
take care of some things.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.832
Hi Carlos. I'm Grace.

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:50.101
Hey little darling.

01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:51.602
We're gonna be homies, right?

01:07:52.842 --> 01:07:55.047
Yeah. we're gonna be tight.

01:07:55.047 --> 01:07:56.380
This all will be over soon.

01:07:57.587 --> 01:07:59.523
Then you can go.

01:08:06.575 --> 01:08:07.601
Don't go.

01:08:23.817 --> 01:08:25.787
I need you alert.

01:08:27.058 --> 01:08:28.892
Don't make me regret this.

01:08:38.754 --> 01:08:40.587
That was fun.

01:08:40.959 --> 01:08:45.002
Now let's go kill Castle and
his miserable whore.

01:08:45.002 --> 01:08:46.939
No, not yet.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.841
We're gonna have ourselves
a little fun with this.

01:08:50.014 --> 01:08:52.654
Next time he has to face us
and a fucking army.

01:08:52.654 --> 01:08:54.591
Where do we get the army from?

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.765
Just like Uncle Sam, bro.

01:08:57.765 --> 01:09:00.673
We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.

01:09:00.673 --> 01:09:04.115
Offer a hundred grand towards
a college education they'll never get.

01:09:04.115 --> 01:09:07.055
Promise nobody ever has to
go to Iraq.

01:09:08.192 --> 01:09:10.430
Just as long as I get to kill Castle.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.603
Don't worry brother. You will.

01:09:12.603 --> 01:09:15.808
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.

01:10:00.385 --> 01:10:01.786
Hold it.

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:08.897
Hello sportsfans.

01:10:16.157 --> 01:10:18.396
How are you today my friend?

01:10:18.396 --> 01:10:20.234
Run! Get out of here!

01:10:20.234 --> 01:10:24.776
Hey! I axed you a question.
- Run!

01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:28.619
You don't answer.

01:10:29.523 --> 01:10:32.588
Guess I'll have to ask it again.

01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:35.869
Here I come.

01:11:17.675 --> 01:11:19.372
Good.

01:11:20.047 --> 01:11:21.141
Bring them upstairs.

01:11:21.483 --> 01:11:22.383
Meet me back down here.

01:11:23.255 --> 01:11:26.292
I'll see if we can talk a few
poor bastards into signing up.

01:11:34.716 --> 01:11:35.942
Where are they?

01:11:43.203 --> 01:11:45.509
I shout. I swear I shout.

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:48.573
Goddamnit! Don't die on me.

01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:51.591
I'm bleeding out.

01:11:51.591 --> 01:11:53.161
I seen this shit before.

01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:55.598
Shut up kid. You're gonna be fine.

01:11:56.436 --> 01:11:58.805
It hurts real bad.
Hurts real bad, Frank.

01:12:01.314 --> 01:12:03.686
Don't let me die like this, man.

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:05.280
Not like this.

01:12:16.317 --> 01:12:17.616
See you in hell.

01:12:18.322 --> 01:12:22.094
I see you anywhere near hell,
I'll kick your ass out.

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:49.658
I haven't seen you in ages, Frank.

01:12:50.635 --> 01:12:53.300
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.

01:12:53.575 --> 01:12:55.635
Maybe I'm just here to see an old friend, Mike.

01:12:56.348 --> 01:12:58.019
Yeah right. I haven't seen you since-

01:12:58.109 --> 01:12:59.981
The funeral. I know.

01:13:02.397 --> 01:13:04.299
I've been reading about you.

01:13:04.568 --> 01:13:07.507
You've been a long way from
the seminary, my friend.

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:11.744
I don't even remember
that as part of my life.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:13.446
Why do you do this?

01:13:15.328 --> 01:13:17.259
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:21.376
For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged.

01:13:21.376 --> 01:13:25.819
And with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:29.125
Matthew. 72.

01:13:32.536 --> 01:13:33.196
I'm Ok with that.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:36.979
God be with you, Frank.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:47.436
Sometimes I'd like to get
my hands on God.

01:14:01.374 --> 01:14:03.003
Interesting choice for a meeting place.

01:14:03.378 --> 01:14:05.612
Didn't take you for a religious man,
Castle.

01:14:06.352 --> 01:14:09.484
Yeah well. An eye for an eye.

01:14:09.694 --> 01:14:12.826
If I remember right, they are
not called the Ten Suggestions.

01:14:13.835 --> 01:14:16.069
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.913
How?-
Doesn't matter.

01:14:18.965 --> 01:14:21.721
Or maybe if you put her in protective
custody like you should've...

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.353
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

01:14:24.454 --> 01:14:26.054
They'd be dead.

01:14:26.702 --> 01:14:28.401
The law can't touch them, Castle.

01:14:29.609 --> 01:14:31.003
Total immunity.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.749
Unless you got a video tape of
Russoti taking them.

01:14:35.924 --> 01:14:37.622
Can't even give him a parking ticket.

01:14:38.062 --> 01:14:40.261
It's a fucked up system you're
sworn to protect.

01:14:41.639 --> 01:14:42.698
I never said it was perfect.

01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:45.740
He wants me in
exchange for them.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:50.018
I need you to secure the trade.

01:14:50.659 --> 01:14:52.122
Ok.

01:14:53.099 --> 01:14:54.871
But I'm doing this by the book.

01:14:54.871 --> 01:14:57.673
What book do you think
they're going by huh?

01:14:58.045 --> 01:14:59.879
I took an oath, Castle.

01:15:00.718 --> 01:15:02.978
There are laws.
-No official police procedure.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.826
You wanna come along?

01:15:05.998 --> 01:15:07.327
Leave your badge at home.

01:15:11.812 --> 01:15:13.172
I have to think about it.

01:15:13.282 --> 01:15:14.607
The clock's ticking.

01:15:37.308 --> 01:15:38.276
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.174
Relax.

01:15:40.849 --> 01:15:43.447
We're looking for a few good man.

01:15:45.661 --> 01:15:47.332
And we'd like to offer you
the opportunity...

01:15:47.332 --> 01:15:50.605
to be all that you can be.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:53.780
Now we've all suffered loss,

01:15:53.808 --> 01:15:56.712
at the hands of the Punisher.

01:15:58.058 --> 01:16:01.065
And because we don't look like
everybody else,

01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:04.038
and because we don't act like
everybody else,

01:16:05.275 --> 01:16:07.437
nobody does a goddamn thing about it.

01:16:08.851 --> 01:16:13.727
Well I say, he ain't the only one who can
take the war into his own hands.

01:16:14.431 --> 01:16:19.811
So if you're as sick of this
cocksucker as I am,

01:16:19.811 --> 01:16:21.883
raise your armies.

01:16:21.883 --> 01:16:22.578
You'll be well paid.

01:16:24.823 --> 01:16:25.951
You'll be well armed.

01:16:27.797 --> 01:16:31.705
And at the end of it, the Punisher
will be dead.

01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:51.434
Agent Budiansky.

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:52.602
Just in time for happy hour.

01:17:53.806 --> 01:17:55.532
You need to come with me.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.240
Where to?

01:17:57.348 --> 01:17:58.681
Your partner, Frank Castle.

01:17:58.718 --> 01:18:00.450
He needs help.

01:18:02.461 --> 01:18:04.796
Partner is a little bit
of an exaggeration.

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:07.130
How did you know?

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:10.169
Usually unless you've arrested Houdini.

01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:13.211
A handcuffed criminal does
not escape that easily.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.152
You know you're not as stupid as you-

01:18:15.653 --> 01:18:16.853
I didn't say that.

01:18:20.037 --> 01:18:21.707
Who are we looking for?

01:18:21.607 --> 01:18:22.803
Cristu's father.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:28.086
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:18:38.483 --> 01:18:39.644
What?

01:18:40.386 --> 01:18:42.056
We're looking for Tiberiu,
Cristu father.

01:18:46.135 --> 01:18:47.160
Why?

01:18:47.605 --> 01:18:48.440
If I were to Tiberiu,

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:52.348
I'd probably wanna find the man who was
responsible for sending my son to prison,

01:18:53.085 --> 01:18:53.848
for the rest of his life.

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:55.950
And how would you do that?

01:18:56.025 --> 01:18:58.328
I tell him when and where to find him.

01:18:58.799 --> 01:19:02.567
What do you want from me?

01:19:02.607 --> 01:19:05.706
I don't like him.
I want him taken care of.

01:19:08.322 --> 01:19:11.261
No worries my friend.

01:20:07.535 --> 01:20:08.735
Here they are.

01:20:08.936 --> 01:20:10.633
Oh boy!

01:20:44.291 --> 01:20:47.585
Take it easy James.
He'll be here.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.680
You get it.
- Fuck that, you get it!

01:20:54.381 --> 01:20:55.776
I'll get it.

01:20:58.858 --> 01:20:59.793
What you looking for?

01:20:59.893 --> 01:21:04.261
I'm here to see the Jigsaw.
- You out of luck. No Jigsaw here.

01:21:05.775 --> 01:21:08.773
I'm here, for the Punisher party.

01:21:18.339 --> 01:21:22.213
Who is the old man?
That's Critu's father.

01:21:24.487 --> 01:21:26.792
Old country genocidal maniac.

01:21:26.792 --> 01:21:29.466
Figured he'd stir up a shitstorm for us.

01:21:29.466 --> 01:21:32.907
Cops will be all over this place
once the fireworks start.

01:21:33.676 --> 01:21:36.240
I wouldn't worry about that,
I called in a explosives permit.

01:21:37.719 --> 01:21:40.783
Consruction. Said we'd be
blasting dynamite all night

01:21:41.562 --> 01:21:44.503
So, what's the plan?

01:21:44.503 --> 01:21:46.200
I going in to get them.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:50.918
You call that a plan.

01:21:50.918 --> 01:21:52.114
It's all I've made.

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:55.889
Well I'm going with you.

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:03.148
I never took the time
to think about where I was headed.

01:22:03.148 --> 01:22:05.449
I'm far down that road.

01:22:07.392 --> 01:22:09.385
You're not going there.

01:22:10.299 --> 01:22:12.736
Thanks Frank.

01:22:13.741 --> 01:22:15.370
You know he's going to take it
out on me when he wakes up.

01:22:16.748 --> 01:22:19.448
You don't hear gunfire for
longer than 5 minutes

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.924
Then the girls are not here.

01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:24.558
Set him loose.

01:26:02.098 --> 01:26:02.688
It's time.

01:26:03.805 --> 01:26:05.599
James, be careful.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:55.552
Oh for fuck sake!

01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:32.180
You won't be replacing that
son of yours any time soon.

01:27:33.553 --> 01:27:36.252
Blood in the urine. Early
indicator of kidney failure.

01:27:41.706 --> 01:27:43.336
You should be seeing
double right about now.

01:27:46.618 --> 01:27:47.809
That would be a torn meniscus.

01:28:31.696 --> 01:28:32.287
James!

01:28:32.397 --> 01:28:33.992
Gun!

01:28:40.584 --> 01:28:42.076
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

01:28:46.599 --> 01:28:48.627
Please help us!
-Shut the fuck up!

01:28:50.641 --> 01:28:52.305
C'mon Castle, don't be shy.

01:28:56.991 --> 01:28:58.118
Throw down your gun!

01:29:04.275 --> 01:29:08.184
Die you bastard.
-No, James

01:29:08.184 --> 01:29:12.023
That's no way to punish the Punisher.

01:29:30.974 --> 01:29:31.869
Nice shooter!

01:29:45.241 --> 01:29:49.954
Catch! Let's play a game.
What do you say?

01:29:50.054 --> 01:29:51.991
You got one round left in there.

01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:56.725
You shoot one of these two
I'll let the other one go free.

01:29:57.638 --> 01:29:59.773
What do you say, Frank?

01:30:00.078 --> 01:30:02.709
Who's it to be,
your fat friend right here?

01:30:03.018 --> 01:30:04.544
Or that nice little piece
of jailbait over there?

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:06.721
Burn in hell!
-Ok

01:30:06.822 --> 01:30:08.022
Then they both die.

01:30:09.133 --> 01:30:09.758
Frank!

01:30:10.703 --> 01:30:15.112
She's a kid. Shoot me.

01:30:32.156 --> 01:30:34.161
Ok, fuck it, kill her first!
-No!

01:30:34.161 --> 01:30:35.094
Stop!

01:30:38.103 --> 01:30:38.661
He's made a decision.

01:30:41.913 --> 01:30:44.784
Not looking too good for you, fatso

01:30:49.097 --> 01:30:51.091
You have to three, Castle!

01:30:51.292 --> 01:30:52.192
One

01:30:54.075 --> 01:30:54.911
Two

01:30:54.911 --> 01:31:00.186
You won't feel a thing my friend.

01:31:20.874 --> 01:31:21.238
God!

01:31:43.797 --> 01:31:45.426
Frank!

01:31:55.759 --> 01:31:56.658
Get out!

01:32:22.124 --> 01:32:23.286
Fuck you!

01:32:24.129 --> 01:32:24.789
Let me put you out of my misery!

01:32:32.482 --> 01:32:34.281
This is just the beginning!

01:32:58.746 --> 01:33:01.275
You ok?

01:33:01.453 --> 01:33:02.611
Where is Castle?
-Still inside

01:33:03.558 --> 01:33:04.583
And Micro?

01:33:11.144 --> 01:33:12.442
Frank!
Are you ok?

01:33:21.502 --> 01:33:22.094
You better get out of here.

01:33:23.607 --> 01:33:25.136
Come on, Frank, I'll buy you a drink.

01:33:26.246 --> 01:33:27.510
Wait! Wait!

01:33:29.154 --> 01:33:33.894
My husband Nicky, we talked about you.

01:33:35.703 --> 01:33:36.933
Argued about you.

01:33:41.283 --> 01:33:42.409
He said you were one of the good guys.

01:34:28.698 --> 01:34:31.729
You know buddy?
Maybe it's time to quit now, huh?

01:34:32.775 --> 01:34:35.646
I mean, you must get tired of this, right?

01:34:36.685 --> 01:34:38.557
I think you got all the criminals in town.

01:34:38.557 --> 01:34:41.257
If there are any left
at least consider rehabilitation.

01:34:44.738 --> 01:34:47.377
I mean contrary to popular
belief, people can change.

01:34:47.377 --> 01:34:51.610
I guess what I'm saying is, I'm
just personally not a fan of the death penalty.

01:34:54.863 --> 01:34:55.523
Frank?

01:34:56.299 --> 01:34:59.006
Where did he go?

01:34:59.006 --> 01:35:02.242
Hey, give me your fucking
wallet motherfucker!

01:35:03.283 --> 01:35:06.724
You're kidding right?
Do I look like I'm fucking kidding?

01:35:07.496 --> 01:35:09.427
Frank!
- Give me your wallet!

01:35:11.002 --> 01:35:11.838
Frank?

01:35:11.838 --> 01:35:12.804
Do you wanna die?

01:35:15.883 --> 01:35:18.849
For the last time, give me your wallet!

01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:25.750
Oh God. Now I've got
brains splattered all over me.
