01:37.458 --> 01:39.833
Are you going to
write any of this?

01:39.833 --> 01:40.667
I wrote plenty.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.500
Plenty?

01:41.500 --> 01:43.375
You wrote act one.

01:43.375 --> 01:44.458
Well, there you are then.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.208
I don't mean you wrote act one.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.208
I mean, you wrote
the words "Act I"

01:48.208 --> 01:50.292
at the top of the first page.

01:50.292 --> 01:51.750
I'm thinking.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.667
Well, what is it
you're thinking?

01:53.667 --> 01:55.833
Do you know that you're
never more than six feet away

01:55.833 --> 01:57.792
from a spider?

01:57.792 --> 01:58.625
Sure.

01:58.625 --> 01:59.958
It goes like this.

01:59.958 --> 02:01.250
You're never
more than six feet away

02:01.250 --> 02:02.875
from a spider, baby.

02:02.875 --> 02:07.792
So you better stay
away from my fly.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.167
That makes no sense.

02:09.167 --> 02:10.167
I liked it.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.792
Well, put it in some other play.

02:11.792 --> 02:12.625
It was your idea.

02:12.625 --> 02:13.833
No.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.375
My idea was that no
matter how secure

02:15.375 --> 02:18.500
you are, how safe you
feel, danger could

02:18.500 --> 02:19.875
be right at your shoulder.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.458
Ah, the spider is a metaphor.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.625
Or a simile.

02:22.625 --> 02:23.792
I can never remember
the difference.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.542
Me neither.

02:25.542 --> 02:26.625
But whichever it is, it's an
important theme for our play,

02:26.625 --> 02:27.250
isn't it?

02:27.250 --> 02:27.792
It is?

02:27.792 --> 02:28.500
Well, yeah.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.958
Think of it.

02:29.958 --> 02:32.333
We have Bridgette, a
beautiful young woman in love,

02:32.333 --> 02:34.458
probably for the first
time in her life,

02:34.458 --> 02:37.958
with Richard, about whom she
knows absolutely nothing.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.333
I mean, he could
be an axe murderer.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.375
But he isn't.

02:42.375 --> 02:43.583
Maybe he should be.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.375
An axe murderer?

02:45.375 --> 02:47.542
No, but a spider.

02:50.583 --> 02:52.875
I mean, maybe axe
murderer is a bit much.

02:52.875 --> 02:57.667
But he should have, like, a
dark side, a dangerous side.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.833
Well, I think he already does.

02:59.833 --> 03:03.667
Well, let's see
what we have on him.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.333
"Richard enters.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.333
He is a pleasant-looking
chap with a perpetual grin.

03:07.333 --> 03:11.333
He's wearing tennis
clothes, holding a bat."

03:15.250 --> 03:17.708
Cricket, anyone?

03:22.708 --> 03:23.625
Wait.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.042
He's playing cricket?

03:25.042 --> 03:26.667
Why is he playing cricket?

03:26.667 --> 03:27.583
Who plays cricket?

03:27.583 --> 03:28.875
He's British.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.667
Why is he British?

03:30.667 --> 03:32.000
Why does it matter?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.042
Well, not scary, for one.

03:34.042 --> 03:36.625
I mean, the scariest thing about
the British is their teeth.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.958
You know, they started taking
better care of their teeth

03:38.958 --> 03:41.250
after the Austin Powers movies.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.292
Yeah, you're right.

03:42.292 --> 03:44.375
It's weird.

03:44.375 --> 03:44.958
OK.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.417
"Richard enters.

03:46.417 --> 03:47.500
He's a pleasant-looking
All-American chap.

03:48.375 --> 03:49.875
He has a perpetual grin.

03:49.875 --> 03:53.458
He's wearing tennis clothes
and carries a racket."

03:53.458 --> 03:54.417
Tennis, anyone?

04:04.583 --> 04:07.750
Gee, I'm shaking in my boots.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.375
He does seem kind of bland.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.583
Yeah.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.000
But remember, this
is the first time

04:12.000 --> 04:14.375
we're seeing him before the
main action of the play.

04:14.375 --> 04:18.583
And his line is an old cliche
meant to evoke titters.

04:18.583 --> 04:23.708
I hope no line I ever
write evokes titters.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.583
So what then?

04:24.583 --> 04:25.458
OK, OK.

04:25.458 --> 04:26.417
I think I have an idea.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.000
"Richard enters.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.708
He's a sly-looking fellow with
an odd, almost unnatural smile

04:35.708 --> 04:38.792
and dark, piercing eyes.

04:38.792 --> 04:42.917
He's dressed in tennis clothes
and holding a tennis racket.

04:42.917 --> 04:47.333
And we see that it is
dripping with blood.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.042
Murder, anyone?

04:55.792 --> 04:57.542
I love it.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.042
And it can set up everything
that's going to happen later.

04:59.042 --> 05:00.958
We haven't written
what happens later.

05:00.958 --> 05:04.417
But even still, it gives
everything we've written so far

05:04.417 --> 05:06.042
kind of foreshadowing.

05:06.042 --> 05:08.583
Something bad is
going to happen.

05:08.583 --> 05:11.833
And never more than six
feet away from a spider.

05:11.833 --> 05:12.833
I know just what to do.

05:12.833 --> 05:13.458
All right.

05:19.375 --> 05:25.708
You're never more than
six feet away from a spider.

05:25.708 --> 05:26.500
Oh, no.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.000
No fucking way.

05:28.000 --> 05:28.833
I was just kidding.

05:28.833 --> 05:29.667
Yeah.

05:40.042 --> 05:42.833
Hello?

05:42.833 --> 05:43.792
Hello?

05:47.667 --> 05:49.583
Who's there?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.458
Hello.

05:50.458 --> 05:53.458
I'm from next door.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.708
Next door?

05:54.708 --> 05:55.708
Yes.

05:55.708 --> 05:58.000
I'm staying with the Babcocks.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.875
Oh.

05:59.875 --> 06:00.500
OK.

06:05.000 --> 06:05.708
Hi.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.500
Richard Babcock.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.833
Oh, you're--

06:10.833 --> 06:14.208
David and Nancy's nephew.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.500
Nephew?

06:16.500 --> 06:19.708
Aren't they a bit old to
be your aunt and uncle?

06:19.708 --> 06:22.708
Great aunt and uncle actually.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.875
Of course.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.000
How silly of me.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.042
Why didn't you come
to the front door?

06:32.042 --> 06:33.042
Why?

06:33.042 --> 06:36.083
Well, I was on the tennis court.

06:36.083 --> 06:38.125
And I walked across the lawn.

06:38.125 --> 06:41.208
I saw the gate in the
fence and came over.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.708
I'm sorry if-- I
didn't mean to--

06:42.708 --> 06:43.583
No, no.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.750
It's quite all right.

06:45.750 --> 06:49.000
I used that gate all the
time when I was a girl.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.083
I used to go over and have
milk and cookies with Nancy

06:52.083 --> 06:53.625
when I was young.

06:53.625 --> 06:56.792
Oh, I do love Aunt
Nancy's cookies.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.167
She still bakes?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.750
I thought she was bedridden.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.792
She is.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.792
I was just remembering
that's all.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.500
You used to visit?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.125
All the time when
I was much younger.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.042
Funny how I don't
remember seeing you.

07:12.042 --> 07:15.750
Maybe it was when I
was away at school.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.042
Yes.

07:17.042 --> 07:18.792
I'm sure that's it.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.792
And you're staying
with them, you said?

07:20.792 --> 07:21.958
Just for a little while.

07:21.958 --> 07:26.042
And where do you usually stay?

07:26.042 --> 07:28.625
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:28.625 --> 07:30.917
Won't you sit down?

07:30.917 --> 07:33.250
Can I get you anything?

07:33.250 --> 07:34.250
Thank you.

07:34.250 --> 07:38.167
I could use some cold water.

07:38.167 --> 07:44.292
I'm still a little sweaty
from hitting all those balls.

07:48.708 --> 07:49.625
I'll be right back.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.667
I just realized I've
forgotten to introduce myself.

08:12.542 --> 08:15.667
I'm Bridgette Nelson.

08:15.667 --> 08:19.167
Pleasure to meet you,
Bridgette Nelson.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.125
I'll be right back
with that water.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.583
Thank you.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.125
Or would you prefer
some lemonade?

08:25.125 --> 08:26.000
Wow.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.917
Yes.

08:26.917 --> 08:28.167
Yes, lemonade.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.000
Yes.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.708
Yeah.

08:30.708 --> 08:33.292
Excuse me?

08:33.292 --> 08:36.167
Not-- I just-- lemonade.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.000
I get excited over lemonade.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.083
That's-- I'm sorry.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.583
Yay, lemonade.

08:43.792 --> 08:44.583
OK then.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.708
What are you doing?

08:59.708 --> 09:00.875
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.208
I'm sorry.

09:02.208 --> 09:07.042
I just-- I like to measure
things, everything.

09:07.042 --> 09:10.875
Did you know that your door
here is exactly 42 inches wide?

09:10.875 --> 09:13.042
Exactly.

09:13.042 --> 09:15.792
No, I didn't.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.750
Why exactly do you
measure everything?

09:18.750 --> 09:22.042
Is it some sort of OCD?

09:22.792 --> 09:24.083
Yes.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.833
Yes.

09:25.833 --> 09:31.042
I absolutely have to know how
long and wide everything is.

09:31.042 --> 09:35.125
And I can't stop
washing my hands.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.958
That's fascinating.

09:36.958 --> 09:38.333
It is.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.917
I have a friend who won't
walk on tile floors.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.250
What a loon.

09:48.125 --> 09:48.750
Thank you.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.208
Well, I hope you
enjoy the lemonade.

09:59.208 --> 10:04.125
It's completely
homemade, or at least

10:04.125 --> 10:05.708
that's what it
says on the bottle.

10:06.667 --> 10:10.208
Oh, I'm sure that I will.

10:10.208 --> 10:16.292
However, there's a little
something I have to do first.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.958
Wait a minute.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.458
Isn't it a little
early in the play

10:29.458 --> 10:31.792
to show that Richard's
a psycho killer?

10:31.792 --> 10:33.167
And we haven't
even really decided

10:33.167 --> 10:34.417
that he is a psycho killer.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.958
No, he's a psycho
killer all right.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.208
But maybe you're right.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.125
Maybe we should hold
back on the violence

10:40.125 --> 10:42.042
and let the tension build.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.458
If this was a movie--

10:43.458 --> 10:44.417
That's the thing.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.125
Why isn't it a movie?

10:46.125 --> 10:47.917
Why are we even writing a play?

10:47.917 --> 10:50.083
This is Los Angeles.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.917
Because it's a play.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.500
But it doesn't have to be.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.792
Look, why spend the next few
weeks, possibly months, writing

10:58.792 --> 11:04.000
a play that'll be put up at some
tiny little black box theater

11:04.000 --> 11:06.167
and be seen by maybe
a dozen people,

11:06.167 --> 11:08.292
because they know
somebody in the cast?

11:08.292 --> 11:10.708
I mean, it'll just be some
other fucking play in LA.

11:10.708 --> 11:13.167
We'll be lucky if we
get even one review.

11:13.167 --> 11:15.417
Nobody cares about
theater in La La Land.

11:15.417 --> 11:18.333
At least in the theater
nobody can tell us what to do.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.042
The writer has power.

11:20.042 --> 11:22.375
No studio executive who's
taken Robert McKee's course

11:22.375 --> 11:24.500
and now thinks he knows
everything there is to know

11:24.500 --> 11:27.000
about writing can
tell us what to write.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.917
But you can't make a
living as a playwright.

11:28.917 --> 11:31.125
There are thousands of
successful playwrights.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.833
In the film business,
you can be a lousy writer

11:34.833 --> 11:36.292
and still make a fortune.

11:36.292 --> 11:39.083
There's just as little
chance of success, even less.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.917
Most movie scripts just
end up taking space

11:40.917 --> 11:42.375
on your hard drive.

11:42.375 --> 11:44.958
At least we have a chance
of someone seeing our play

11:44.958 --> 11:46.542
and nobody can fuck us over.

11:46.542 --> 11:49.208
Not everybody in the film
business gets fucked.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.208
And we can negotiate
for some real money.

11:51.208 --> 11:54.208
One thing I know is true,
in the film industry,

11:54.208 --> 11:55.417
you will get fucked.

11:55.417 --> 11:57.292
The only thing you're
ever negotiating

11:57.292 --> 11:58.875
is the amount of the lubricant.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.375
All right.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.042
All right.

12:00.042 --> 12:00.458
Fine.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.375
Fine.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.208
It's a play, for now.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.875
But there's something
I got to change.

12:04.875 --> 12:05.750
What?

12:05.750 --> 12:06.542
Richard.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.917
His name, it's too normal.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.250
Don't we want him
to seem normal?

12:11.250 --> 12:12.375
No.

12:12.375 --> 12:14.417
I think he should
be exceptional.

12:14.417 --> 12:18.042
And I think he's exceptionally
good-looking, exceptionally

12:18.042 --> 12:21.583
charming, and he should have
an exceptional-sounding name.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.250
What do you have
in mind, Aloysius?

12:23.250 --> 12:24.917
OK, not that exceptional.

12:24.917 --> 12:29.083
But it could be
something upper crusty,

12:29.083 --> 12:31.917
like one of those first names
that can also be a last name.

12:31.917 --> 12:37.000
I went to school with a very
WASP-y kid named Cooper.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.167
Cooper?

12:38.167 --> 12:39.917
Cooper.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.875
Cooper Babcock.

12:42.875 --> 12:43.583
I like it.

12:43.583 --> 12:44.333
It's--

12:44.333 --> 12:45.083
Upper crusty?

12:45.083 --> 12:45.958
Upper crusty.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.458
Cooper Babcock it is.

12:48.458 --> 12:51.583
Search and replace and done.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.250
Maybe it's too upper crusty.

12:54.250 --> 12:55.458
No, it's fine.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.125
Let's move on.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.958
Now, what are we doing
about this strangling scene?

12:58.958 --> 12:59.917
OK.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.458
So we know that Richard--

13:01.458 --> 13:02.458
Cooper.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.167
-Cooper wants the Picasso.

13:05.167 --> 13:08.292
But what if all he
wants is the Picasso?

13:08.292 --> 13:12.833
Like we know he's a thief and
the audience can know that.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.583
But we don't know that
he's a psycho killer,

13:15.583 --> 13:17.458
because we haven't
decided whether or not

13:17.458 --> 13:18.917
he's the psycho killer.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.042
What do we have so far?

13:20.042 --> 13:22.458
All right.

13:22.458 --> 13:23.583
We introduce Richard--

13:23.583 --> 13:24.500
Cooper.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.125
-Cooper Babcock.

13:26.125 --> 13:29.458
And we see that he
has done something

13:29.458 --> 13:32.042
bloody with the tennis racket,
but we don't know what.

13:32.042 --> 13:36.167
We also don't know what he's
done with Nancy and David,

13:36.167 --> 13:39.042
or if he's even
related to them at all.

13:39.042 --> 13:42.958
But we do know that he is
interested in the Picasso

13:42.958 --> 13:45.250
and he's not at all
interested in Bridgette.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.292
Aha.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.500
That's what we have to change.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.875
What?

13:48.875 --> 13:50.167
That he isn't
interested in Bridgette.

13:50.167 --> 13:51.667
What if he has plans
to take the Picasso,

13:51.667 --> 13:53.250
but he's so taken
with Bridgette that it

13:53.250 --> 13:54.292
puts a crimp in his plan?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.333
Hmm.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.000
That could work.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.500
But something's bothered me.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.417
I don't think we should show
the bloody tennis racket.

14:01.417 --> 14:02.542
No, but it's great.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.000
That's a terrific,
horrific image.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.583
Yeah, but it gives
away too much.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.125
I mean, the audience
should feel some sympathy

14:09.125 --> 14:11.167
for Cooper, at
least a little bit.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.167
At first.

14:12.167 --> 14:13.167
But later on--

14:13.167 --> 14:14.375
Later on is something else.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.417
Let's see where this takes us.

14:16.417 --> 14:17.542
I've got an idea.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.458
But in order for
it to work, Cooper

14:20.458 --> 14:23.375
has to be much younger,
like Bridgette's age.

14:32.333 --> 14:36.208
So how are you enjoying
staying with David and Nancy?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.417
Oh, they're no trouble.

14:37.417 --> 14:39.042
No trouble at all.

14:39.042 --> 14:41.458
And how are you
getting on with Milo?

14:41.458 --> 14:42.333
Milo?

14:42.333 --> 14:43.708
Yes.

14:43.708 --> 14:47.250
Don't you find him
extraordinarily intelligent?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.000
Yes, of course.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.208
We've had many
long conversations.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.708
He has a very interesting
perspective on life.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.417
You're funny.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.000
Am I?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.625
You've had many long
conversations with a dog?

15:03.958 --> 15:06.167
Well, they were
rather one-sided.

15:06.167 --> 15:09.083
I could barely get
a word in edgewise.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.750
You are funny.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.667
So where do you
usually stay when

15:16.667 --> 15:18.458
you're not staying next door?

15:18.458 --> 15:20.042
I was in prison.

15:20.042 --> 15:20.583
Prison?

15:20.583 --> 15:21.542
Prison?

15:21.542 --> 15:22.417
No.

15:22.417 --> 15:23.500
Yes.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.583
At least it felt that way.

15:27.583 --> 15:31.083
So I decided to take
a little time off.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.583
Mhm.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.500
For good behavior?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.083
Something like that.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.042
So what do you do?

15:40.042 --> 15:45.292
Well, I was at Bryn Mawr,
graduated with highest honors.

15:45.292 --> 15:49.792
And I'm now, like most
people, unemployed.

15:49.792 --> 15:52.458
Thank God I am filthy rich.

15:55.458 --> 16:01.167
Well, it does take a bit of
the pressure off, doesn't it?

16:01.167 --> 16:03.208
Unfortunately, my
parents' trust fund

16:03.208 --> 16:05.500
doesn't kick in until I'm 30.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.208
That is ghastly.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.458
Ghastly indeed.

16:10.458 --> 16:16.708
So till then, I'll just have
to survive however I can.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.042
Maybe tennis.

16:19.042 --> 16:19.750
Are you good?

16:23.792 --> 16:28.833
Well, I usually hit
what I'm supposed to.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.208
How's your serve?

16:32.750 --> 16:36.375
Hardly ever returned.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.792
Really?

16:37.792 --> 16:39.667
Then, you are good.

16:50.833 --> 16:51.708
Wait a second.

16:51.708 --> 16:52.750
What the fuck is that?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.167
Someone in a chicken costume.

16:54.167 --> 16:55.500
Yeah.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.750
I can see it's someone
in a chicken costume.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.583
Why is it someone in
a chicken costume?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.292
I thought it would
be cool to introduce

17:00.292 --> 17:02.125
a surreal element to the play.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.625
You see, this is why
I like the movies,

17:03.625 --> 17:06.875
because nobody just shows
up in a chicken costume.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.458
That's the beauty of theater.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.750
There are no rules.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.583
If you want someone
in a chicken costume,

17:11.583 --> 17:13.833
you can have someone
in a chicken costume.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.833
Well, I don't want someone
in a chicken costume.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.208
What do you got against
someone in a chicken costume?

17:18.208 --> 17:19.083
It makes no sense.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.167
What if it made sense?

17:21.167 --> 17:23.667
How is it going to make sense?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.708
Watch and learn.

17:30.208 --> 17:32.458
Huh.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.208
Where is everybody?

17:34.208 --> 17:37.292
The costume party is
tomorrow night, Blain.

17:37.292 --> 17:38.542
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:38.542 --> 17:39.708
That can't be right.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.750
Today is Friday the
16th, is it not?

17:41.750 --> 17:45.375
It's Friday all right,
but it's the 15th.

17:45.375 --> 17:48.583
But he's in costume.

17:48.583 --> 17:49.833
Those are tennis clothes.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.167
So they are.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.667
My apologies.

18:00.667 --> 18:03.167
We were just having
some lemonade.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.833
Ah.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.875
I think I could use something
a little bit stronger.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.667
So could I, come to think of it.

18:11.667 --> 18:12.667
Cooper?

18:12.667 --> 18:14.583
I'm good with this.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.417
Blaine, this is Cooper.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.833
He's staying with the Babcocks.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.583
Really?

18:20.583 --> 18:24.208
My house is just abreast the
starboard side of their house.

18:24.208 --> 18:25.583
I haven't seen you.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.458
How long have you been there?

18:27.458 --> 18:30.167
Just a few days.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.833
Cooper says he
talks to their dog.

18:33.833 --> 18:38.458
In all fairness, we are
speaking to a chicken.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.667
So we are.

18:39.667 --> 18:40.625
How silly.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.500
Well, cheers.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.625
The chicken costume was
a last-minute decision.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.208
I was going to go
as Freddy Krueger.

18:50.208 --> 18:54.542
But I've gone as old Freddy
for every costume party

18:54.542 --> 18:57.375
and Halloween outing
since I was nine.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.375
Well, it's a very
good chicken costume.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.708
And it suits you.

19:04.708 --> 19:05.958
Mhm.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.625
It does, sort of.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.792
How so, would you say?

19:10.792 --> 19:14.958
Well, you see, I've got a
dreadful heart condition.

19:14.958 --> 19:18.875
Any severe shock and I
could drop dead right here.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.833
So naturally, I'm timid
of things like horror

19:21.833 --> 19:25.500
films and violence, you know.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.667
But you dressed
like Freddy Krueger.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.250
Well, if I dress
like the scary thing,

19:32.250 --> 19:33.792
I'm not likely to get scared.

19:33.792 --> 19:34.625
Now, am I?

19:36.458 --> 19:39.500
Very clever.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.333
Look, I have all the stuff set
up in the kitchen for tomorrow.

19:43.333 --> 19:46.542
Shall I be naughty and
get us some snacks?

19:46.542 --> 19:50.042
Caviar, champagne, cocaine?

19:50.042 --> 19:51.750
Why don't you just ring for it?

19:51.750 --> 19:54.000
The staff has the night off.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.292
Oh my God.

19:56.292 --> 19:58.708
You have to actually
get things for yourself?

19:58.708 --> 20:00.375
However will you survive?

20:00.375 --> 20:02.000
Very funny.

20:02.000 --> 20:02.917
I'll be right back.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.875
Oh, Blain, you and Cooper
should get along famously.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.708
He was admiring my
father's Picasso before.

20:14.708 --> 20:15.500
Was he?

20:20.000 --> 20:24.458
Admiring daddy's
Picasso were we?

20:24.458 --> 20:28.333
What the fuck are
you doing here?

20:28.333 --> 20:29.917
What the fuck are
you doing here?

20:29.917 --> 20:32.583
I'm introducing a plot twist.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.833
So you're saying Blain and
Cooper know each other?

20:34.833 --> 20:38.583
Not only know each other,
but they're in cahoots.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.542
Cahoots?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.292
Who are you, Buffalo Bill?

20:41.292 --> 20:42.833
It's a perfectly good word.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.375
Yes.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.792
This is where we
reveal that something

20:46.792 --> 20:49.917
is going on that the
audience didn't realize.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.667
There's something going
on that I didn't realize.

20:52.667 --> 20:53.667
Don't worry.

20:53.667 --> 20:54.458
I've got it all worked out.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.000
What the fuck are
you doing here?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.333
Imagine my surprise
when I come here

21:02.333 --> 21:04.292
and see you sitting
there a day early.

21:04.292 --> 21:05.375
It's not part of the plan.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.583
I improvised.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.958
Why leave a house
full of witnesses?

21:07.958 --> 21:10.667
Drunk witnesses at
a costume party.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.500
I could've taken the painting
from right under their noses.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.750
No one would've identified you.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.583
Except you.

21:15.583 --> 21:16.625
You can trust me.

21:16.625 --> 21:17.833
You're in a chicken suit.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.500
Look, it's going to work.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.833
We take the painting tonight,
take care of Bridgette.

21:22.833 --> 21:25.958
Then, tomorrow--
listen. --as the guests

21:25.958 --> 21:29.625
arrive, we among them,
walk in to discover

21:29.625 --> 21:33.583
a horrible bloody scene.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.333
But--

21:34.333 --> 21:35.667
Bloody scene?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.333
Does it-- does it have
to be a bloody scene?

21:37.333 --> 21:39.750
Doesn't have to
be, but I really,

21:39.750 --> 21:42.958
really, really want it to be.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.708
You're a sick fuck, Blain.

21:45.708 --> 21:48.958
Hey, you were down
with the plan before.

21:48.958 --> 21:52.500
Remember robbery, murder,
something Manson-esque?

21:54.500 --> 21:55.000
That was before.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.458
Before what?

22:00.083 --> 22:03.125
Before I met her.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.917
I like her.

22:05.917 --> 22:09.708
She's a real person.

22:09.708 --> 22:13.083
She's a stuck-up real bitch
who deserves everything

22:13.083 --> 22:14.667
that's coming to her.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.500
Who's that?

22:15.500 --> 22:19.125
Oh, no.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.833
Just this chick
from the club, walks

22:21.833 --> 22:23.500
around acting like
a princess just

22:23.500 --> 22:26.667
because her parents are rich.

22:26.667 --> 22:29.542
I utterly loathe
people like that.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.417
OK.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.542
Dig in.

22:34.542 --> 22:39.000
There's caviar,
Scottish salmon, blinis,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.917
and grapes from my
father's vineyard, food

22:41.917 --> 22:43.125
for the common folk.

22:44.833 --> 22:45.708
Common folk.

22:45.708 --> 22:46.917
Poors.

22:46.917 --> 22:50.208
Those poor people.

22:50.208 --> 22:53.958
I saw you admiring my
father's Picasso before.

22:53.958 --> 22:57.500
It's his pride and joy.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.792
I thought you were
his pride and joy.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.542
Don't make me laugh.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.000
He couldn't auction me
off for $50 million.

23:08.042 --> 23:08.875
It'll be OK.

23:08.875 --> 23:09.667
Wrong pipe.

23:09.667 --> 23:10.958
Wrong pipe.

23:10.958 --> 23:11.833
You'll be all right.

23:11.833 --> 23:12.708
Won't you, buddy?

23:12.708 --> 23:13.667
Yes.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.083
$50 million you say?

23:15.083 --> 23:16.625
Yes.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.833
He had an offer for that
for some art dealer.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.083
But dad turned him down.

23:21.083 --> 23:25.167
Now, if the father of some
boy from a good family

23:25.167 --> 23:30.042
offered that for me, well, he'd
sell in the blink of an eye.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.542
Oh, that's absurd.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.542
People don't sell people.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.917
Don't they?

23:34.917 --> 23:37.833
I mean, after all,
it's the ruling class'

23:37.833 --> 23:39.458
most popular commodity.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.583
They sell each other
their children,

23:41.583 --> 23:44.583
sell each other to the country.

23:44.583 --> 23:47.208
It's called American politics.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.708
Yes.

23:48.708 --> 23:53.083
Well, aren't you
philosophical for a chicken?

23:53.083 --> 23:57.500
I thought of having
someone steal the Picasso.

23:59.292 --> 24:04.250
As you were saying,
steal the Picasso?

24:04.250 --> 24:08.833
Yes, just to spite my father
and, of course, for the money.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.667
You need money?

24:10.667 --> 24:11.917
Absolutely.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.125
None of this is mine.

24:15.125 --> 24:17.958
I don't even really
live here anymore.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.708
My parents are at their
house on Martha's Vineyard

24:20.708 --> 24:22.917
and I'm crashing here.

24:22.917 --> 24:26.042
If they knew I was here,
well, they'd call the cops.

24:26.042 --> 24:27.625
Why is that?

24:27.625 --> 24:31.958
Because I'm a bad, bad girl.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.292
Didn't you know?

24:33.292 --> 24:35.208
I don't believe I did.

24:39.167 --> 24:41.000
Bad how?

24:46.167 --> 24:47.833
Where have you been all my life?

24:54.917 --> 24:55.917
OK.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.542
She's the worst type of bad.

24:57.542 --> 24:59.208
One, she slept with a Mexican.

24:59.208 --> 25:03.333
Two, she's tattooed and pierced
and voted for Barack Hussein

25:03.333 --> 25:04.750
Obama.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.542
He wasn't Mexican.

25:06.542 --> 25:08.708
He was from Ecuador.

25:08.708 --> 25:09.708
A Mexican.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.667
Anyway, far worse than that.

25:12.667 --> 25:16.000
I also used my father's
electronic setup

25:16.000 --> 25:20.083
to eavesdrop on the two of you
while I was getting snacks.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.833
OK.

25:21.833 --> 25:26.083
So you'd like to
murder me, Blain,

25:26.083 --> 25:28.208
in a particularly bloody way?

25:28.208 --> 25:28.958
I would never.

25:28.958 --> 25:29.750
It's a joke.

25:29.750 --> 25:30.208
It's a joke.

25:30.208 --> 25:30.875
Never.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.625
Oh, fuck.

25:32.625 --> 25:33.208
Oh.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.208
Oh, fuck.

25:34.208 --> 25:36.792
The fucking bitch shot me.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.292
Bridgette.

25:38.292 --> 25:38.958
Bridgette.

25:40.208 --> 25:41.042
Stop.

25:41.042 --> 25:43.958
You help me right now.

25:43.958 --> 25:47.167
I could probably make it.

25:47.167 --> 25:51.292
We could go to Cedars
or St. Joseph's.

25:51.292 --> 25:53.625
Oh, please.

25:53.625 --> 25:54.875
Please, help me.

25:54.875 --> 25:55.917
Please.

25:55.917 --> 25:56.875
Are you going to shoot me too?

25:56.875 --> 25:57.875
Oh, it hurts--

25:57.875 --> 25:59.875
I haven't decided that yet.

25:59.875 --> 26:01.333
Depends.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.250
Please, brother.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.375
Help me, please.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.292
Please?

26:04.292 --> 26:05.208
On what?

26:05.208 --> 26:07.000
My feathers are bloody.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.292
Oh, please.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.750
Did you mean it when
you said you liked me?

26:10.750 --> 26:11.667
Help me.

26:11.667 --> 26:12.625
Please.

26:13.375 --> 26:15.417
Yes.

26:15.417 --> 26:20.125
Yes, I did, very much so.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.917
There's a light.

26:21.917 --> 26:25.000
Oh, looks like one of those
lights outside of a barbershop.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.375
What?

26:26.375 --> 26:27.333
Please.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.250
Oh, Jesus, Lord.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.375
Oh.

26:30.375 --> 26:33.000
Even right now.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.667
I think I see Gram Gram.

26:35.667 --> 26:38.167
I smell the cinnamon
buns she made.

26:38.167 --> 26:39.125
Please.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.125
Oh.

26:40.125 --> 26:41.042
That's not grandma.

26:41.042 --> 26:41.750
That's Satan.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.250
Oh, please.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.292
Oh, goodness.

26:44.292 --> 26:46.167
You're making this very awkward.

26:46.167 --> 26:49.083
I made you a fucking
friendship bracelet.

26:49.083 --> 26:50.792
Shut up about the bracelet.

26:50.792 --> 26:54.000
I'm very happy for you both,
but I'm fucking dying here.

26:54.000 --> 26:54.792
Please.

26:54.792 --> 26:56.125
Not fast enough.

26:56.750 --> 26:57.250
Fuck.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.792
Oh.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.750
Shot again.

27:04.792 --> 27:07.292
Was that second shot
really necessary?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.000
I think it was.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.792
Well, he was a racist chicken.

27:12.792 --> 27:14.750
What happens now?

27:15.792 --> 27:16.792
I haven't figured that out yet.

27:19.875 --> 27:22.042
So what happens now?

27:22.042 --> 27:23.292
I haven't figured that out yet.

27:23.292 --> 27:25.958
Look, I'm not sure
about any of this.

27:25.958 --> 27:28.375
So we're saying Bridgette is
the psycho killer, not Cooper?

27:28.375 --> 27:29.417
Yes.

27:29.417 --> 27:30.833
And she's the one with the plan.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.125
What's the plan?

27:32.125 --> 27:34.250
To steal her father's
Picasso and blame it

27:34.250 --> 27:36.500
on Blain and another accomplice.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.333
You know, I actually like this.

27:38.333 --> 27:41.833
It's getting very classical
stage mystery/comedy.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.417
You know, like Deathtrap
or The Mousetrap.

27:44.417 --> 27:45.333
You're right.

27:45.333 --> 27:46.792
It is.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.417
Oh, fuck.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.125
We should change everything.

27:50.125 --> 27:53.292
We should go back and make
it less like those plays

27:53.292 --> 27:54.750
and make it more movie-like.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.333
There you go with that
movie thing again.

27:56.333 --> 27:59.167
You do know that The Mousetrap
is the most successful, longest

27:59.167 --> 28:00.458
running play in history?

28:00.458 --> 28:02.958
And Deathtrap ran
forever and they even

28:02.958 --> 28:06.292
made a movie out of it with
Michael Caine and Superman.

28:06.292 --> 28:08.083
Christopher Reeve.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.458
If we can write a play even
half as successful as those two,

28:09.458 --> 28:10.292
we'll have a hit.

28:10.292 --> 28:11.917
Think of it.

28:11.917 --> 28:14.083
Small cast, one set, thrills
and chills and comedy.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.917
Nobody's writing plays
like this anymore.

28:15.917 --> 28:17.292
Yeah, because they're old hat.

28:17.292 --> 28:18.792
No, they're not.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.167
If you can write a good
play in that genre,

28:20.167 --> 28:23.000
you can get it produced
and make a lot of money.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.792
Community theaters
love that kind of shit.

28:24.792 --> 28:29.208
What happened to the idea of
a surrealistic, avant garde,

28:29.208 --> 28:30.958
mind-bending neo-noir thriller?

28:30.958 --> 28:34.042
Have you ever noticed that
the avant garde never changes?

28:34.042 --> 28:35.542
If it's after garde,
when was garde?

28:35.542 --> 28:36.500
I must've missed it.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
That would be apres garde.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.375
What would be?

28:38.375 --> 28:41.750
Our play, Murdertrap.

28:41.750 --> 28:42.375
Murdertrap?

28:42.375 --> 28:43.458
Yes.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.958
I just came up with it.

28:44.958 --> 28:46.875
Cool title, huh?

28:46.875 --> 28:50.042
Isn't it a little much like
Deathtrap or The Mousetrap?

28:50.042 --> 28:51.417
Only in the "trap" part.

28:51.417 --> 28:53.917
Besides it makes a
great movie title.

28:53.917 --> 28:55.208
Someday.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.083
Someday.

28:56.083 --> 28:56.917
All right.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.125
You've convinced me.

28:58.125 --> 29:01.000
After it's a huge
Broadway success.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.208
One thing though.

29:02.208 --> 29:06.292
Don't these characters
seem British?

29:06.292 --> 29:07.833
Why do you say that?

29:07.833 --> 29:09.250
Well, I don't know
anyone like these people.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.083
Do you any British
people like these people?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.875
No.

29:12.875 --> 29:16.292
But I think that it would be
classier if they were British.

29:16.292 --> 29:17.333
OK.

29:17.333 --> 29:18.417
Let's make them British again.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.125
Is the painting in the lorry?

29:30.125 --> 29:31.292
Yes.

29:31.292 --> 29:33.083
And thank goodness
no one saw me.

29:33.083 --> 29:37.833
This is Fanlee on the Bump,
the most exclusive community

29:37.833 --> 29:39.875
off the roundabout
to East Sussex.

29:39.875 --> 29:43.542
No one sees anything.

29:43.542 --> 29:44.292
Two lumps?

29:47.083 --> 29:47.708
Thanks, darling.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.875
So what do we do about Blain?

29:52.875 --> 29:55.375
Just leave him there
behind the couch.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.875
Remember, we caught
him in the midst

29:57.875 --> 30:02.833
of committing grand larceny
and justifiably shot him.

30:02.833 --> 30:04.167
Mhm.

30:04.167 --> 30:06.250
Twice.

30:06.250 --> 30:08.125
The gun has a hair trigger.

30:09.542 --> 30:12.208
I think you should say we
were being held captive.

30:12.208 --> 30:17.208
There was a struggle and the
gun went off quite accidentally.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.250
Twice?

30:19.250 --> 30:20.917
Could be hard to explain.

30:20.917 --> 30:22.208
Not really.

30:22.208 --> 30:25.167
You were fighting for your life.

30:25.167 --> 30:27.167
I was fighting for my life?

30:27.167 --> 30:29.000
Well, the police
will never believe

30:29.000 --> 30:30.333
that I could've disarmed him.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.417
Yes.

30:34.417 --> 30:37.167
You're quite right.

30:37.167 --> 30:38.417
We'll have to say I shot him.

30:38.417 --> 30:41.875
Oh, well.

30:41.875 --> 30:48.125
Now, how exactly do we
explain the chicken suit?

30:48.125 --> 30:49.167
That's easy.

30:49.167 --> 30:50.667
We'll tell the truth.

30:50.667 --> 30:52.958
Blain mistook the
date and thought

30:52.958 --> 30:56.208
he was going to be
attending a costume party.

30:56.208 --> 30:56.667
All right.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.417
Yeah.

30:58.417 --> 31:00.542
Well, how do we explain me?

31:00.542 --> 31:03.292
You're my neighbor.

31:03.292 --> 31:09.583
Bridgette, I'm not
really your neighbor.

31:09.583 --> 31:13.417
But you're David
and Nancy's nephew.

31:13.417 --> 31:15.917
Unfortunately, not.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.208
Great nephew?

31:18.208 --> 31:20.375
Not even remotely related.

31:20.375 --> 31:23.000
But you are staying
with them, aren't you?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.542
In a manner of speaking, yes.

31:25.542 --> 31:28.542
Whatever do you mean?

31:28.542 --> 31:30.375
I'm afraid I slit
both their throats

31:30.375 --> 31:32.167
and buried them in
the rose garden.

31:32.167 --> 31:32.708
Oopsie daisy.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.583
And Milo?

31:34.583 --> 31:37.000
Milo is just fine.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.417
What the bloody hell
do you take me for?

31:41.417 --> 31:46.708
Possibly my soulmate.

31:48.625 --> 31:50.417
Oh, I was hoping
you felt that way.

31:50.417 --> 31:52.583
I felt an immediate attraction
towards you the moment

31:52.583 --> 31:54.250
I first laid eyes on you.

31:54.250 --> 31:56.167
And it's only deepened
massively in the brief time

31:56.167 --> 31:57.708
I've known you.

31:57.708 --> 32:02.250
You are a complete sociopath
without one single redeeming

32:02.250 --> 32:03.583
quality.

32:03.583 --> 32:06.708
I'm afraid that's entirely true.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.250
Kiss me.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.583
Oh, it still hurts.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.583
Oh, it's not happened yet.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.708
I think I did shit--

32:21.375 --> 32:22.667
Please.

32:22.667 --> 32:25.333
I made you that fucking
friendship bracelet.

32:25.333 --> 32:28.292
I gave you my last
Livestrong bracelet.

32:28.292 --> 32:30.458
Hold on a tick.

32:30.458 --> 32:31.708
Help me, please.

32:31.708 --> 32:32.583
Please.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.292
We can stop for fro-yo.

32:34.292 --> 32:35.458
I know you love Menchies.

32:36.333 --> 32:41.125
Why don't you just die?

33:00.458 --> 33:02.333
Murder, anyone?

33:08.083 --> 33:10.792
So now, we have two psycho
killers in the scene.

33:10.792 --> 33:12.500
Three if you count, Blain.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.667
Isn't that a bit much?

33:13.667 --> 33:14.583
No, no, no.

33:14.583 --> 33:16.208
The more, the merrier.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.833
You can never have too many
psycho killers, Clarice.

33:18.833 --> 33:20.250
OK.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.333
But it's getting a
little far-fetched.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.625
Well, isn't that the point?

33:22.625 --> 33:25.375
Isn't art supposed
to be far-fetched?

33:25.375 --> 33:29.125
You don't plop down a hundred or
even $12.50 to go see something

33:29.125 --> 33:30.708
that's fetched.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.417
I don't think that's
an actual term.

33:32.417 --> 33:33.458
Why not?

33:33.458 --> 33:35.042
Why are things only far-fetched?

33:35.042 --> 33:37.500
Why can't they be
merely-fetched or 3/4-fetched?

33:37.500 --> 33:38.792
I don't know.

33:38.792 --> 33:40.708
The point is, where
do we go from here?

33:40.708 --> 33:42.542
We've already thrown
out the whole outline.

33:42.542 --> 33:43.542
You know what?

33:43.542 --> 33:44.792
I think that's a good thing.

33:44.792 --> 33:46.375
Let's take this thing
as far as we can.

33:46.375 --> 33:49.750
And I am not wild about
them being British.

33:49.750 --> 33:50.667
OK.

33:50.667 --> 33:51.875
So make them American.

33:51.875 --> 33:53.625
I'll go back and
change lorry to truck

33:53.625 --> 33:56.292
and make the other things in
that scene more American later.

33:56.292 --> 33:56.792
All right.

33:56.792 --> 33:57.500
All right.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.125
All right.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.458
Great.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.333
Because I have an idea
for what happens next.

34:00.333 --> 34:01.208
Carry on, old chap.

34:01.208 --> 34:02.333
I said not British.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.375
I just wanted to
get that out there

34:03.375 --> 34:05.792
before we go all colonial again.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.125
All right.

34:07.125 --> 34:08.583
It's later now.

34:08.583 --> 34:11.458
Cooper, I'm worried someone's
going to find the body

34:11.458 --> 34:12.708
and ruin everything.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.375
Don't even worry about it.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.792
Blain fit right in the grave
next to David and Nancy.

34:16.792 --> 34:21.083
And he's now perfectly covered
by David's prizewinning roses.

34:21.083 --> 34:23.583
Blain's disappearance won't
be noticed for a while.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.750
He often disappears for months
at a time and only returns

34:26.750 --> 34:28.500
when he runs out of money.

34:28.500 --> 34:33.792
But how ever are we going
to explain David and Nancy?

34:33.792 --> 34:35.375
What?

34:35.375 --> 34:36.833
Why do we need to explain
anything about them?

34:36.833 --> 34:39.625
What do they have to do with us?

34:39.625 --> 34:40.875
You're right.

34:40.875 --> 34:43.292
I hadn't thought
of it like that.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.417
We're in the clear.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.417
Nothing can stop us now.

34:48.917 --> 34:49.833
Hello?

34:49.833 --> 34:51.542
Anybody home?

34:51.542 --> 34:53.125
Who can that be?

34:53.125 --> 34:53.833
I don't know.

34:53.833 --> 34:54.750
It sounds like a woman.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.375
Hello?

34:58.375 --> 34:59.875
Her voice doesn't
sound familiar.

34:59.875 --> 35:02.125
I don't want to let her in.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.292
I think you have to.

35:04.292 --> 35:05.708
You can't do
anything suspicious.

35:15.292 --> 35:17.875
Hello.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.250
Sup, bitches?

35:19.250 --> 35:20.417
I'm Mary Clemens.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.500
I'm a psychic.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.375
I live next door.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.292
Wait, wait, wait.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.417
We can't have a
psychic next door.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.958
That's right out of Deathtrap.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.583
Well, cheese and crackers.

35:31.583 --> 35:32.750
I'll make it different.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.667
Yeah, it got all muddy.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.458
I am Mary Clemens.

35:36.458 --> 35:38.292
I am blind.

35:41.292 --> 35:42.417
Who's there?

35:42.417 --> 35:43.958
A blind woman?

35:43.958 --> 35:45.333
We can't have a blind woman.

35:45.333 --> 35:46.750
That's out of Wait Until Dark.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.625
We can't rip off two
successful plays like that.

35:48.625 --> 35:49.458
It's not a rip off.

35:49.458 --> 35:50.917
It's an homage.

35:50.917 --> 35:51.833
An homage?

35:51.833 --> 35:53.250
Yes.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.500
And besides, Deathtrap
had a psychic.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.500
And Wait Until Dark
had a blind woman.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.375
But neither of those
had a blind psychic.

36:00.375 --> 36:00.958
OK.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.500
It's an homage.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.250
But let's make her
French and not a psychic.

36:04.250 --> 36:05.292
All right.

36:05.292 --> 36:07.500
I am Marie Clement de la France.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.625
I am blind and I am a medium.

36:10.625 --> 36:11.833
A medium?

36:11.833 --> 36:13.958
You mean a psychic,
like in Deathtrap?

36:13.958 --> 36:16.958
No, not
at all like that play.

36:16.958 --> 36:18.333
No.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.917
I cannot read mind
or see the future.

36:19.917 --> 36:21.250
See, guys?

36:21.250 --> 36:22.375
Shit ain't nothing
like Deathtrap.

36:22.375 --> 36:25.375
But I can tell the past.

36:25.375 --> 36:28.833
Also not like The Dead Zone.

36:28.833 --> 36:30.958
Won't you sit down, Ms. Clement?

36:30.958 --> 36:33.000
Merci beaucoup.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.042
Oh, um.

36:34.042 --> 36:35.875
It's just to your right.

36:35.875 --> 36:36.542
Oh, no.

36:36.542 --> 36:37.500
Sorry.

36:37.500 --> 36:37.875
Can you help her, please?

36:37.875 --> 36:38.542
Mhm.

36:38.542 --> 36:39.292
Here.

36:39.292 --> 36:40.375
Just-- right.

36:40.375 --> 36:40.792
No.

36:40.792 --> 36:41.417
No.

36:41.417 --> 36:41.875
Oh gosh.

36:41.875 --> 36:42.500
Almost.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.000
Almost.

36:43.000 --> 36:43.708
Can you--

36:43.708 --> 36:44.375
Are you OK?

36:46.458 --> 36:48.333
Sorry.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.375
You're finding it.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.375
Almost.

36:50.375 --> 36:50.875
You just need to do a 180.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.500
OK.

36:55.917 --> 36:57.292
Oh, goodness.

36:57.292 --> 36:57.792
Here.

36:57.792 --> 36:58.417
Take my--

36:59.333 --> 36:59.750
OK.

36:59.750 --> 37:00.500
Just--

37:00.500 --> 37:00.875
Here.

37:00.875 --> 37:01.708
OK.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.417
Now, easy does it.

37:03.417 --> 37:03.875
Easy does it.

37:03.875 --> 37:04.500
Voila.

37:04.500 --> 37:04.917
Yay.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.708
Voila.

37:07.708 --> 37:12.875
So you say you have the uncanny
ability to see the past?

37:14.375 --> 37:15.875
Indeed I do.

37:15.875 --> 37:19.500
Excuse me, but don't we
all have that ability?

37:19.500 --> 37:21.750
Uh, pardon me, but don't
we all have that ability?

37:21.750 --> 37:22.917
No.

37:22.917 --> 37:24.667
own past.

37:24.667 --> 37:25.667
Everybody can.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.292
No one care.

37:27.292 --> 37:29.917
But with this power I have,
which I did not ask for,

37:29.917 --> 37:32.833
I merely need to be in
the presence of a person

37:32.833 --> 37:35.042
and I immediately
see their whole life,

37:35.042 --> 37:37.667
like a movie or a play.

37:37.667 --> 37:40.042
Again, not like The Dead Zone.

37:40.042 --> 37:42.542
It is quite formidable.

37:42.542 --> 37:45.667
And you say that's why you've
come here this evening?

37:45.667 --> 37:46.375
Oui.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.417
Quite so.

37:47.417 --> 37:49.417
But that is not the only reason.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.708
I have been summoned.

37:51.708 --> 37:52.750
Summoned?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.958
By whom?

37:54.958 --> 37:55.792
The dead.

38:00.125 --> 38:01.625
The lights are flickering, yes?

38:04.125 --> 38:04.875
The dead?

38:10.333 --> 38:12.042
Well, that's just
a bit far-fetched.

38:12.042 --> 38:13.792
Wouldn't you say, Ms. Clement?

38:13.792 --> 38:14.458
No.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.333
No.

38:15.333 --> 38:16.083
It's quite fetched.

38:16.083 --> 38:18.500
Is that the correct usage?

38:18.500 --> 38:19.958
My English is not so well.

38:19.958 --> 38:20.625
No.

38:20.625 --> 38:21.625
It's OK.

38:21.625 --> 38:22.958
But let me get this straight.

38:22.958 --> 38:25.958
You're saying you
communicate with the dead?

38:30.000 --> 38:30.958
Of course.

38:30.958 --> 38:33.458
I am a medium, after all.

38:33.458 --> 38:36.167
But I not only communicate
with the departed.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.667
I bring them--

38:37.667 --> 38:39.500
Fascinating, Ms. Clement.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.875
But what does any of
that have to do with me?

38:41.875 --> 38:42.917
I don't even--

38:42.917 --> 38:44.458
May I have your hand, Bridgette?

38:46.958 --> 38:48.167
How did you know my name?

38:48.167 --> 38:50.375
You're hand.

38:50.375 --> 38:51.083
Oh.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.458
It's here.

38:55.750 --> 38:56.917
What is it?

38:56.917 --> 39:00.458
Ma cher, I see
everything clearly.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.958
What do you see?

39:01.958 --> 39:04.000
It is what I do not see.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.083
What is that?

39:05.083 --> 39:06.917
I do not see a penis.

39:06.917 --> 39:07.875
Say what?

39:07.875 --> 39:08.750
A penis.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.042
No?

39:10.042 --> 39:12.708
I do not see a penis.

39:12.708 --> 39:14.542
A penis?

39:14.542 --> 39:15.667
What the hell is that?

39:15.667 --> 39:17.125
It's happiness.

39:17.125 --> 39:20.000
It just sounds like "a
penis," because she's French.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.125
But the audience is going to
think she's saying "a penis."

39:24.125 --> 39:26.208
You think so?

39:26.208 --> 39:27.208
A penis.

39:28.750 --> 39:29.708
A penis.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.625
A penis.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.458
Maybe you're right.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.875
I'll add this.

39:35.875 --> 39:40.458
I do not see much
happiness in your life.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.667
She's trying to say "happiness."

39:42.667 --> 39:43.542
Oui.

39:43.542 --> 39:44.958
Happiness.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.125
I thought she was saying--

39:46.125 --> 39:47.542
No.

39:47.542 --> 39:48.917
We know what we
thought she was saying.

39:48.917 --> 39:52.125
Bridgette, there is so
much sadness in your life.

39:52.125 --> 39:52.958
Your father--

39:52.958 --> 39:55.750
Please.

39:55.750 --> 39:58.458
I don't want to
discuss my father.

39:58.458 --> 40:00.167
There's something
really wrong here.

40:00.167 --> 40:01.875
You don't like where
the story's going?

40:01.875 --> 40:02.625
No.

40:02.625 --> 40:03.500
It's not that.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.833
It's the characters.

40:04.833 --> 40:05.917
They have no inner lives.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.667
We don't really care about them.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.667
They're just pieces we're
moving around on a chessboard.

40:09.667 --> 40:11.000
You're right.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.500
There's nobody to care
about in this movie--

40:13.500 --> 40:14.792
play, play.

40:14.792 --> 40:16.875
We need a moment, a
glimpse into the soul,

40:16.875 --> 40:19.208
of one of the characters.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.083
Marie?

40:20.083 --> 40:21.167
Why Marie?

40:21.167 --> 40:22.708
Well, she's interesting.

40:22.708 --> 40:24.500
She's a blind, French, psychic.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.208
That's the problem.

40:25.208 --> 40:27.583
She's too interesting.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.125
Well, Cooper?

40:29.125 --> 40:30.917
We want to keep him
sort of enigmatic.

40:30.917 --> 40:31.875
Don't we?

40:31.875 --> 40:32.917
You're right.

40:32.917 --> 40:35.083
That just leave Bridgette.

40:35.083 --> 40:36.833
I think I've got a
way to go with her.

40:36.833 --> 40:39.917
Oh, a wise guy, eh?

40:39.917 --> 40:41.958
Well, be my guest.

40:41.958 --> 40:43.583
I think this will do it.

40:47.958 --> 40:50.083
You say you do not want
to talk about your life,

40:50.083 --> 40:53.125
but what else have
we but our lives?

40:53.125 --> 40:58.208
I don't want to talk about my
life, because it's too painful.

40:58.208 --> 41:03.792
You say you do not see
much happiness in my life?

41:03.792 --> 41:05.833
That's true.

41:05.833 --> 41:09.250
Also, no love.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.958
That's not exactly true.

41:11.958 --> 41:23.958
I was in love once, with a boy
named Eduardo, Eduardo Gomez

41:23.958 --> 41:27.583
Alfonso de la Guapa.

41:27.583 --> 41:32.750
My father did everything
he could to break us up.

41:32.750 --> 41:33.292
I'm sorry.

41:33.292 --> 41:34.125
Why is that?

41:42.042 --> 41:46.083
Alfonso was dark complected.

41:46.083 --> 41:50.958
Even in these enlightened
times of post-racial America,

41:50.958 --> 41:55.042
my father was hateful.

41:55.042 --> 42:02.625
He systematically destroyed
our love, had Eduardo deported,

42:02.625 --> 42:08.000
and forced me to have
a late-term abortion.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.125
Afterward, I hated my
father with a passion.

42:14.125 --> 42:19.625
My mother insisted that my
father had acted out of love.

42:19.625 --> 42:24.250
But I saw no love
in his actions.

42:24.250 --> 42:28.208
I, determined to spend
the rest of my life

42:28.208 --> 42:35.000
defying his authority,
flaunting his prejudices,

42:35.000 --> 42:39.083
I had many public affairs.

42:39.083 --> 42:45.750
Black men, Brown
men, even women.

42:45.750 --> 42:50.167
You should've seen my
father froth at the mouth

42:50.167 --> 42:55.250
at the idea of his poor
sweet little daughter

42:55.250 --> 42:56.708
becoming a lesbian.

42:59.792 --> 43:03.208
That was the final straw.

43:03.208 --> 43:09.167
He threw me out and
disinherited me.

43:09.167 --> 43:11.417
I swore revenge.

43:11.417 --> 43:17.833
And nothing can stand in my
way, no code of morals or ethics

43:17.833 --> 43:19.625
or laws.

43:19.625 --> 43:21.917
I'm my own.

43:21.917 --> 43:26.958
I own me.

43:26.958 --> 43:27.958
And scene.

43:37.958 --> 43:39.125
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:39.125 --> 43:40.167
She's a racist?

43:40.167 --> 43:41.375
No, but her father is.

43:41.375 --> 43:43.917
And she's trying
to get back at him.

43:43.917 --> 43:46.125
I hate it.

43:46.125 --> 43:49.667
It is a little overblown
with the Judy Garland spot.

43:49.667 --> 43:51.792
I just don't think we need it.

43:51.792 --> 43:53.917
I mean, why do we
care about her past?

43:53.917 --> 43:55.125
We know she's a psychopath.

43:55.125 --> 43:57.167
That's all we need
to know about her.

43:57.167 --> 43:57.792
OK.

43:57.792 --> 43:58.292
Cut it.

43:58.292 --> 44:00.958
It's cut.

44:00.958 --> 44:05.458
Now, let's up the stakes here.

44:05.458 --> 44:08.000
So you say you were summoned
here by dead people?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.042
Oui.

44:09.042 --> 44:12.375
But it was very confusion.

44:12.375 --> 44:16.875
I was summoned by a poulet.

44:16.875 --> 44:18.875
Oh, no.

44:18.875 --> 44:21.333
A poulet?

44:21.333 --> 44:23.333
You mean a chicken?

44:23.333 --> 44:24.167
Oui.

44:24.167 --> 44:26.292
But not a chicken.

44:26.292 --> 44:28.417
It was very, very confusion.

44:28.417 --> 44:29.333
Yes.

44:29.333 --> 44:32.167
It is very confusion.

44:32.167 --> 44:34.750
Could you give us
just a moment, please?

44:34.750 --> 44:36.167
But of course.

44:36.167 --> 44:37.917
Not a problem.

44:37.917 --> 44:38.333
Oh.

44:41.167 --> 44:44.167
I sense you have some champagne.

44:44.167 --> 44:46.375
Oh, yes.

44:46.375 --> 44:47.917
Should I--

44:47.917 --> 44:48.792
No, no, no.

44:48.792 --> 44:50.167
It will speak to me.

44:50.167 --> 44:53.042
I am a medium.

44:53.042 --> 44:56.708
Bring some spirits back from
the dead, including alcohol.

45:00.292 --> 45:01.917
We have to get rid of her.

45:01.917 --> 45:03.458
What can she know?

45:03.458 --> 45:06.083
She knows about
the chicken suit.

45:06.083 --> 45:08.083
I want to find out
what else she knows.

45:08.083 --> 45:12.417
You play a very dangerous
game, Bridgette.

45:12.417 --> 45:15.167
Haven't you figured me out yet?

45:15.167 --> 45:19.458
Danger is my middle name.

45:19.458 --> 45:21.208
Sure thing.

45:21.208 --> 45:23.417
But what about me?

45:23.417 --> 45:25.208
I don't know your middle name.

45:25.208 --> 45:26.125
Shirley.

45:26.125 --> 45:27.083
Shirley?

45:27.083 --> 45:28.333
William Goldberg III, yes.

45:31.125 --> 45:32.125
Shirley.

45:32.125 --> 45:34.208
I'm curious, Ms. Clement.

45:34.208 --> 45:36.542
No, it's not two.

45:36.542 --> 45:37.458
Um.

45:37.458 --> 45:39.375
Marie, please.

45:39.375 --> 45:41.083
I am not so formal.

45:41.083 --> 45:43.000
Oui.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.333
Marie, then.

45:44.333 --> 45:48.917
How exactly do the dead
communicate with you?

45:48.917 --> 45:50.417
It is very interesting.

45:50.417 --> 45:52.917
I get a cryptic--

45:52.917 --> 45:54.083
is that the word?

45:54.083 --> 45:56.125
-a cryptic message.

45:56.125 --> 46:01.833
A word, a phrase, like a
text message in my mind.

46:01.833 --> 46:05.333
So the dead text message you?

46:05.333 --> 46:08.333
Yes, like a text,
but not exactly.

46:08.333 --> 46:11.292
Then, they tell me where to go
and it must have the seance.

46:11.292 --> 46:12.417
A seance?

46:12.417 --> 46:13.458
Is that necessary?

46:13.458 --> 46:14.833
Mademoiselle Bridgette.

46:14.833 --> 46:15.625
Yes?

46:15.625 --> 46:17.458
Yes, I am talking to you.

46:17.458 --> 46:20.167
There is a departed soul who
wishes to communicate with you.

46:20.167 --> 46:23.042
It is tres, tres necessary.

46:23.042 --> 46:25.500
Well, then, let's have a seance.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.125
Bridgette.

46:28.125 --> 46:30.000
What's the worst
that can happen?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.542
Either nothing or some
disembodied spirit

46:32.542 --> 46:35.292
raps on a table?

46:35.292 --> 46:38.958
I must warn you, I'm not
like the other medium.

46:38.958 --> 46:43.292
Not only can I summon the souls
of the departed, I summon--

46:43.292 --> 46:44.583
Whatever.

46:44.583 --> 46:47.417
Sounds like fun.

46:47.417 --> 46:48.292
Fuck it.

46:48.292 --> 46:49.042
Let's have some fun.

46:50.458 --> 46:53.042
I think this is where the
intermission should go.

46:53.042 --> 46:54.250
Intermission?

46:54.250 --> 46:55.667
What do we need an
intermission for?

46:55.667 --> 46:57.250
Movies don't have intermissions?

46:57.250 --> 46:58.208
Well, they used to.

46:58.208 --> 46:59.500
I remember seeing Ben-Hur.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.125
They had a long intermission.

47:01.125 --> 47:02.542
Well, yeah.

47:02.542 --> 47:04.375
For one thing, Ben-Hur
was, like, four hours long.

47:04.375 --> 47:07.958
And for another thing, no movies
have intermissions anymore.

47:07.958 --> 47:09.375
This is not a movie.

47:09.375 --> 47:11.292
And theatergoers
expect an intermission.

47:11.292 --> 47:12.542
I hate intermissions.

47:12.542 --> 47:14.417
I mean, why give the
audience the chance

47:14.417 --> 47:17.125
to go out and discuss the
play at the halfway point?

47:17.125 --> 47:19.167
What if someone's like
really enjoying the play

47:19.167 --> 47:20.667
and they overhear
somebody else saying,

47:20.667 --> 47:23.125
gee, this plays sucks, and
it changes their attitude

47:23.125 --> 47:24.000
entirely?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.208
That never happens.

47:25.208 --> 47:27.000
Besides maybe the
reverse can happen.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.208
Somebody could think the play
sucks, go out in the lobby,

47:29.208 --> 47:31.500
hear someone else raving
about it, and say,

47:31.500 --> 47:35.292
I must've missed something
that guy obviously appreciates.

47:35.292 --> 47:37.375
Besides, what about the
women who have to pee?

47:37.375 --> 47:39.208
Men have to pee too.

47:39.208 --> 47:42.083
Have you ever seen the
line outside the restroom

47:42.083 --> 47:43.583
during the
intermission of a play?

47:43.583 --> 47:45.500
The women are lined up
from here to Zanzibar.

47:45.500 --> 47:48.208
The men go in, unzip,
pee, and they're out again

47:48.208 --> 47:49.708
in 10 seconds.

47:49.708 --> 47:51.917
Nobody ever leaves in the
middle of a movie to pee.

47:51.917 --> 47:53.500
This isn't a movie.

47:53.500 --> 47:55.125
It's a play.

47:55.125 --> 47:57.083
Besides, the little
black box theaters

47:57.083 --> 48:00.042
need time to sell their
drinks and snacks.

48:00.042 --> 48:01.250
Oh, yes.

48:01.250 --> 48:04.958
The old $1 worth of
white wine for $8.

48:04.958 --> 48:06.208
What a value.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.500
They need to make
their money somewhere.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.500
They're not making
it at the box office.

48:09.500 --> 48:10.375
All right.

48:10.375 --> 48:11.042
You made your point.

48:11.042 --> 48:12.125
OK.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.208
We'll put the intermission here.

48:14.208 --> 48:17.250
Now, for some reason,
I have to pee.

48:27.083 --> 48:29.167
Ladies and gentlemen, that
concludes the first act

48:29.167 --> 48:30.708
of our performance.

48:30.708 --> 48:32.708
Please feel free to enjoy some
refreshments in the lobby.

48:32.708 --> 48:34.500
And when the lights
flicker, make your way

48:34.500 --> 48:35.333
back to your seats.

48:48.083 --> 48:49.500
Ah, fuck it.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.375
This play is too short
for an intermission.

48:51.375 --> 48:52.375
You're right.

48:52.375 --> 48:53.250
Let's go right into act two.

48:53.250 --> 48:54.125
All right.

48:54.125 --> 48:56.750
OK, ball, you are ready?

49:12.000 --> 49:15.125
The axis on planets must flip.

49:18.208 --> 49:19.125
No, no, no.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.208
Just the tip.

49:20.208 --> 49:21.375
What does all that mean?

49:21.375 --> 49:22.708
Shh.

49:22.708 --> 49:25.333
You must remain silent
during the incantation.

49:25.333 --> 49:28.250
The spirits are very
restless tonight.

49:28.250 --> 49:29.500
Sorry.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.208
This is my first seance.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.333
No, no.

49:34.333 --> 49:36.625
You must not touch
the summoning candle.

49:36.625 --> 49:39.667
It must remain lit
for the duration.

50:10.500 --> 50:13.458
Bridgette?

50:13.458 --> 50:16.333
Bridgette.

50:16.333 --> 50:17.458
Oh God.

50:17.458 --> 50:20.375
That's Nancy Babcock's voice.

50:20.375 --> 50:21.667
Oh, good Lord.

50:21.667 --> 50:23.708
I only ever heard her
screaming in pain.

50:23.708 --> 50:24.708
I mean--

50:24.708 --> 50:25.542
It doesn't matter.

50:28.542 --> 50:32.542
Marie has checked out.

50:32.542 --> 50:34.167
Shit.

50:34.167 --> 50:40.333
Bridgette, don't you want
any more of my cookies?

50:40.333 --> 50:41.542
No, I don't.

50:41.542 --> 50:45.208
I never liked your cookies.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.542
Whore.

50:46.542 --> 50:52.458
You there, boy, what did
I ever do to harm you?

50:52.458 --> 50:53.583
Nothing, actually.

50:53.583 --> 50:54.625
Nothing at all.

50:54.625 --> 50:57.458
Then, why did you send me here?

50:57.458 --> 51:01.750
It's so cold and damp.

51:01.750 --> 51:03.667
I'm so sorry.

51:03.667 --> 51:07.250
You know, if I could
do it all over again--

51:07.250 --> 51:09.750
Yes?

51:09.750 --> 51:11.125
I'd still kill you.

51:11.125 --> 51:13.417
Just being honest.

51:13.417 --> 51:14.750
I do love that about you.

51:18.375 --> 51:21.583
Who the fuck ruined my roses?

51:21.583 --> 51:23.583
David?

51:23.583 --> 51:27.417
I tended those
roses for 30 years.

51:27.417 --> 51:30.417
And now, I'm
fertilizer for them.

51:30.417 --> 51:31.458
Hey, come on.

51:31.458 --> 51:32.500
I put a lot of effort into that.

51:32.500 --> 51:33.708
I was trying to be thoughtful.

51:33.708 --> 51:34.833
Thoughtful?

51:34.833 --> 51:37.167
You buried me with
that shrew I've

51:37.167 --> 51:40.417
been stuck with since I was 23.

51:40.417 --> 51:42.333
Shut up, you old fart.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.708
Oh, get your fat ass
back in the kitchen.

51:47.625 --> 51:50.542
I always thought of them as
a particularly loving couple.

51:50.542 --> 51:51.667
Yeah.

51:51.667 --> 51:53.292
They seemed so
compatible the way

51:53.292 --> 51:56.500
they screamed each other's
names when they died.

51:56.500 --> 52:00.167
You just can't tell what
goes on behind closed doors.

52:00.167 --> 52:01.375
It's true.

52:01.375 --> 52:02.542
Who knows what
they're really up to?

52:05.458 --> 52:07.167
They are gone.

52:07.167 --> 52:09.875
Of course, I remember nothing.

52:09.875 --> 52:11.292
Did you get a message?

52:11.292 --> 52:13.208
Oh, not really.

52:13.208 --> 52:16.500
Just some old
neighbors dropping by.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.333
That is very strange.

52:18.333 --> 52:23.458
There was a very powerful and
angry spirit which summoned me.

52:23.458 --> 52:24.417
OK.

52:24.417 --> 52:25.250
Well, we try again, huh?

52:25.250 --> 52:25.792
Oh, please.

52:25.792 --> 52:27.250
No.

52:27.250 --> 52:28.417
You don't need to go
to any more trouble.

52:28.417 --> 52:30.500
It's been very interesting.

52:30.500 --> 52:31.958
But enough is enough.

52:44.375 --> 52:45.875
Milo?

52:45.875 --> 52:47.708
You said you didn't kill him.

52:47.708 --> 52:48.333
I know.

52:48.333 --> 52:49.667
I know.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.667
He looked so sad without
the food and water he--

52:51.667 --> 52:54.292
and he also started to
eat David's eyeball.

52:54.292 --> 52:55.875
Oh.

52:55.875 --> 52:57.208
I know.

52:57.208 --> 52:58.833
It's like in less
than half a day,

52:58.833 --> 53:00.792
a dog can go from loving
the shit out of you

53:00.792 --> 53:05.500
to eating your eyeball
out of your dead corpse.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.292
Finally.

53:11.292 --> 53:13.250
I've been trying to reach
you guys for 20 minutes.

53:13.250 --> 53:15.500
But the only thing I'm getting
from this French lunatic

53:15.500 --> 53:16.667
is a busy signal.

53:16.667 --> 53:18.375
Blain?

53:18.375 --> 53:19.292
Yes, Blain.

53:19.292 --> 53:20.250
Who'd you think it was?

53:20.250 --> 53:21.542
Elvis?

53:21.542 --> 53:23.833
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

53:23.833 --> 53:26.375
to be on hold when you're dead?

53:26.375 --> 53:29.875
Coop, I am very
disappointed in you.

53:29.875 --> 53:32.000
I didn't know she was
going to shoot you.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.708
You didn't seem to give
a fuck that she did.

53:34.708 --> 53:35.458
Hey.

53:35.458 --> 53:36.458
You know me.

53:36.458 --> 53:39.375
I go with the flow.

53:39.375 --> 53:40.250
Hey.

53:40.250 --> 53:41.375
You wanted to kill me.

53:41.375 --> 53:42.375
Remember?

53:42.375 --> 53:44.542
In a particularly bloody way.

53:44.542 --> 53:45.958
But I didn't.

53:45.958 --> 53:47.667
There's a difference between
wanting to commit murder

53:47.667 --> 53:50.417
and murdering someone.

53:50.417 --> 53:53.375
Apparently, you
didn't know that.

53:53.375 --> 53:55.833
And now, you're going
to have to face--

53:55.833 --> 53:57.542
-the consequences.

53:57.542 --> 53:59.917
Consequences.

53:59.917 --> 54:01.417
What consequences?

54:01.417 --> 54:03.333
You're just a ghost.

54:03.333 --> 54:04.542
Am I?

54:04.542 --> 54:06.292
Marie here's been
trying to tell you

54:06.292 --> 54:08.792
that she isn't just any old
French, blind, psychic medium.

54:08.792 --> 54:09.917
No, no, no.

54:09.917 --> 54:12.583
She does much, much
more than that.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.417
See that candle over there?

54:14.417 --> 54:15.750
Yeah.

54:15.750 --> 54:18.417
That's an ancient
Egyptian summoning candle.

54:18.417 --> 54:21.333
It was used by
Isis, not that ISIS,

54:21.333 --> 54:23.750
to raise Osiris from the dead.

54:23.750 --> 54:26.458
Not only does Marie
summon the soul

54:26.458 --> 54:28.917
of the departed, she summons--

54:28.917 --> 54:30.542
The body.

54:39.708 --> 54:40.500
Hey.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.417
I'm back.

54:42.417 --> 54:43.583
Great to be back.

54:43.583 --> 54:45.000
I'm just, you know, dead.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.375
Ah.

54:47.375 --> 54:50.333
You remember what a really,
really bad hangover feels like?

54:50.333 --> 54:52.000
Yeah, well, this kind
of feels like that

54:52.000 --> 54:56.333
plus the overwhelming
desire to eat brains.

54:56.333 --> 54:58.042
What kind of zombie are you?

54:58.042 --> 54:59.375
Huh?

54:59.375 --> 55:01.500
Zombies don't talk.

55:01.500 --> 55:02.750
What?

55:02.750 --> 55:04.583
Everything you
know about zombies

55:04.583 --> 55:05.875
you know from the movies.

55:05.875 --> 55:07.708
That doesn't make them true.

55:07.708 --> 55:10.750
Those movies don't
get anything right.

55:10.750 --> 55:12.083
What about the brains thing?

55:12.083 --> 55:13.833
Nah, I made that up.

55:13.833 --> 55:15.917
I mean, what possible good
could eating brains do?

55:15.917 --> 55:17.875
Really, think about it.

55:17.875 --> 55:19.375
No.

55:19.375 --> 55:20.667
I just want to kill you.

55:20.667 --> 55:23.000
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

55:25.667 --> 55:26.792
Zombie?

55:26.792 --> 55:27.875
Are you kidding me?

55:27.875 --> 55:28.667
What?

55:28.667 --> 55:29.458
Zombies are hot.

55:29.458 --> 55:30.667
Hot?

55:30.667 --> 55:32.042
There are five
million zombie movies.

55:32.042 --> 55:34.708
There's The Walking
Dead and 28 Days Later

55:34.708 --> 55:37.958
and Zombieland and Shaun
of the Dead and Night

55:37.958 --> 55:40.667
of the Living Dead and Return
of the Living Dead and Dawn

55:40.667 --> 55:43.167
of the Dead and Day of the
Dead and Afternoon of the Dead.

55:43.167 --> 55:44.083
I missed that one.

55:44.083 --> 55:45.500
Whatever.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.417
Zombies are played
out, finished, over.

55:47.417 --> 55:48.833
Hardly.

55:48.833 --> 55:51.083
That's why they keep
making new ones every year.

55:51.083 --> 55:53.958
It's money in the
bank, a zombie movie.

55:53.958 --> 55:57.583
This, in case I haven't
made it sufficiently clear,

55:57.583 --> 55:59.000
is not a movie.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.458
It's a play.

56:00.458 --> 56:01.167
Fine.

56:01.167 --> 56:02.875
It's a zombie play then.

56:02.875 --> 56:05.125
There certainly aren't
too many of those around.

56:05.125 --> 56:07.875
That's because
theatergoers want something

56:07.875 --> 56:09.958
more than just the
regurgitated pap

56:09.958 --> 56:13.000
they can get any day of the
week at their local multiplex.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.958
Oh, people who go
to the theater.

56:15.958 --> 56:19.417
You really don't like
common people, do you?

56:19.417 --> 56:20.875
What do you mean by that?

56:20.875 --> 56:23.542
Well, you've turned your
nose up at popular culture,

56:23.542 --> 56:24.875
as if they're stupid.

56:24.875 --> 56:26.917
What's wrong with a
little commercial success?

56:26.917 --> 56:28.042
You've got it all wrong.

56:28.042 --> 56:29.458
It's not that I dislike people.

56:29.458 --> 56:30.792
I just want to
give them something

56:30.792 --> 56:32.500
worthwhile, thought-provoking.

56:32.500 --> 56:33.167
Oh, really?

56:33.167 --> 56:34.583
12 people at a time?

56:34.583 --> 56:36.917
With a movie, you
can reach millions.

56:36.917 --> 56:39.500
You can write a movie
on your own time.

56:39.500 --> 56:42.875
We agreed to write a play.

56:42.875 --> 56:43.667
All right.

56:43.667 --> 56:45.583
All right.

56:45.583 --> 56:49.125
I just want to write a play that
could be adapted into a movie.

56:49.125 --> 56:51.458
Besides, this is
only the first draft.

56:51.458 --> 56:55.667
Why don't we play it out to the
end and see how we feel then?

56:55.667 --> 56:57.250
Whatever.

56:57.250 --> 57:00.667
I just don't want to keep having
the same argument with you.

57:00.667 --> 57:01.667
Now, where are we?

57:01.667 --> 57:02.083
All right.

57:02.083 --> 57:03.708
OK.

57:03.708 --> 57:06.667
What I have is that the
David and Nancy zombies come

57:06.667 --> 57:08.000
crashing back into the room.

57:08.000 --> 57:08.917
Two more zombies?

57:08.917 --> 57:09.792
Are you kidding me?

57:09.792 --> 57:11.000
We can't have that.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.583
How are you going
to get two actors

57:12.583 --> 57:15.958
to audition for non-speaking
zombie roles in a play?

57:15.958 --> 57:18.125
Well, you know, in
a movie, there are

57:18.125 --> 57:20.208
thousands of extras lining up.

57:20.208 --> 57:22.125
Again, that's a movie.

57:22.125 --> 57:23.958
This is a play.

57:23.958 --> 57:28.542
How then, are we going to
explain that Blain comes back

57:28.542 --> 57:31.583
as a zombie, but
David and Nancy don't?

57:31.583 --> 57:32.208
I don't know.

57:32.208 --> 57:33.167
This is so stupid.

57:34.125 --> 57:34.792
All right.

57:34.792 --> 57:35.792
I've got.

57:35.792 --> 57:36.625
I think I've got something.

57:41.167 --> 57:44.042
Brains.

57:44.042 --> 57:48.000
David and Nancy are staggering
across the lawn, very slowly.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.958
They're going to take
at least 20 minutes.

57:49.958 --> 57:51.917
Oh, they don't look so good.

57:51.917 --> 57:54.292
Brains.

57:54.292 --> 57:55.458
Big brains.

57:58.250 --> 57:59.667
We have to do something.

57:59.667 --> 58:02.708
Yes, you have to die.

58:02.708 --> 58:04.167
But don't worry.

58:04.167 --> 58:06.750
It's not so bad, once you
get past the worms eating

58:06.750 --> 58:08.083
your flesh.

58:08.083 --> 58:10.875
The medium, this has all
happened because of her.

58:10.875 --> 58:11.917
You're right.

58:11.917 --> 58:12.958
We have to snap her out of it.

58:12.958 --> 58:14.542
You fend off Blain while I try.

58:14.542 --> 58:16.042
Yes.

58:16.042 --> 58:17.042
Marie.

58:17.042 --> 58:19.000
Marie, wake up.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
Marie, you have to wake up.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.167
Bridgette, I miss you.

58:25.167 --> 58:28.583
Ay, dios mio.

58:28.583 --> 58:29.792
Eduardo?

58:29.792 --> 58:31.292
I miss you, cara mia.

58:31.292 --> 58:32.125
You're dead?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.208
It's so hot in here.

58:37.208 --> 58:38.333
Ay, dios mio.

58:39.917 --> 58:41.333
You're in hell?

58:41.333 --> 58:43.875
No, in Ecuador.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.292
Enough with Eduardo.

58:45.292 --> 58:47.083
She's just connecting
with the dearly departed,

58:47.083 --> 58:48.208
like the dearly deported.

58:53.083 --> 58:56.917
Happy birthday to you.

58:56.917 --> 59:02.375
Happy birthday to you.

59:02.375 --> 59:08.625
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

59:08.625 --> 59:12.708
Oh, why do I always get the
fuzzy end of the lollipop?

59:12.708 --> 59:17.375
Jack, if you don't call me back,
I'm going to take all these--

59:17.375 --> 59:18.708
-pills.

59:18.708 --> 59:20.625
Now, she's Marilyn Monroe.

59:20.625 --> 59:22.875
Is she buried in
the rose garden too?

59:22.875 --> 59:24.042
No.

59:24.042 --> 59:25.833
She's just a disembodied spirit.

59:25.833 --> 59:28.667
Haven't you heard that
sometimes happens to suicides?

59:28.667 --> 59:29.833
Keep going.

59:29.833 --> 59:30.625
What should I do?

59:30.625 --> 59:31.208
I don't know.

59:31.208 --> 59:32.417
But do it fast.

59:32.417 --> 59:34.875
Chicken Boy's wearing
me the fuck out.

59:34.875 --> 59:36.375
I should've been Freddy Krueger.

59:36.375 --> 59:37.333
No.

59:37.333 --> 59:38.375
It's a good chicken suit.

59:44.875 --> 59:45.875
Sacre bleu.

59:51.292 --> 59:52.000
Shit.

59:57.125 --> 1:00:00.250
You haven't seen the last of me.

1:00:00.250 --> 1:00:02.750
I'll be back.

1:00:05.083 --> 1:00:05.792
Fuck you.

1:00:29.875 --> 1:00:38.458
Bridgette, was it
really necessary?

1:00:42.750 --> 1:00:45.500
Apparently.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:48.375
This is all insane.

1:00:48.375 --> 1:00:49.333
Yes, it is.

1:00:49.333 --> 1:00:52.292
I know.

1:00:52.292 --> 1:00:53.250
But it's over now.

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:10.708
Seriously?

1:01:10.708 --> 1:01:12.083
Kung Fu and Karate?

1:01:12.083 --> 1:01:14.167
How are we going to do that?

1:01:14.167 --> 1:01:16.458
We'll use stunt
doubles, of course.

1:01:16.458 --> 1:01:17.417
It's a movie.

1:01:17.417 --> 1:01:19.292
No one will ever know.

1:01:19.292 --> 1:01:23.333
It's a fucking play.

1:01:54.958 --> 1:01:57.875
I might be some bloody
poultry, but you're no match

1:01:57.875 --> 1:02:00.833
for my Kung Fu stylings.

1:02:00.833 --> 1:02:04.333
Let's go then, Kung Pao chicken.

1:02:17.458 --> 1:02:18.958
Let's go, Cooper.

1:02:25.333 --> 1:02:26.917
How is this happening?

1:02:26.917 --> 1:02:28.292
I killed Marie?

1:02:28.292 --> 1:02:30.250
Must be the fact that the
candle's still burning.

1:02:30.250 --> 1:02:31.208
You get to the candle.

1:02:31.208 --> 1:02:32.208
I'll handle chicken boy.

1:02:32.208 --> 1:02:32.833
All right?

1:02:32.833 --> 1:02:33.250
OK.

1:03:12.125 --> 1:03:15.375
We can't afford to
choreograph any more.

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:18.000
Blow the fucking candle out.

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:30.167
Thank you.

1:03:33.208 --> 1:03:35.958
This is awful.

1:03:35.958 --> 1:03:38.167
Kung Fu zombies?

1:03:38.167 --> 1:03:41.625
Hey, that's a great title.

1:03:41.625 --> 1:03:45.000
I can't believe my name
is going to be on this.

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.250
Are you kidding me?

1:03:46.250 --> 1:03:48.042
This is great stuff.

1:03:48.042 --> 1:03:49.375
Boy, oh, boy.

1:03:49.375 --> 1:03:51.167
Wait till you read the
ending I come up with.

1:03:56.583 --> 1:03:57.500
To us.

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:58.583
To us.

1:04:02.375 --> 1:04:05.625
It has been quite an evening.

1:04:05.625 --> 1:04:07.958
Yes, it has.

1:04:07.958 --> 1:04:10.167
It's a good thing that bit
with the candle worked.

1:04:10.167 --> 1:04:12.500
I was about to be
zombied to death.

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.208
That's right.

1:04:14.208 --> 1:04:18.292
I was about to be pecked to
death by a zombie chicken.

1:04:18.292 --> 1:04:20.042
Wow.

1:04:20.042 --> 1:04:21.375
I've definitely done enough
digging in that rose garden.

1:04:21.375 --> 1:04:22.083
That's for sure.

1:04:22.083 --> 1:04:22.958
Four bodies?

1:04:22.958 --> 1:04:24.542
Yeah, that's enough.

1:04:24.542 --> 1:04:25.917
Thank goodness there's you.

1:04:29.083 --> 1:04:31.250
Yeah.

1:04:31.250 --> 1:04:33.583
You're pretty remarkable.

1:04:33.583 --> 1:04:35.458
As are you.

1:04:35.458 --> 1:04:38.083
We're sort of made
for each other.

1:04:38.083 --> 1:04:39.333
I think so.

1:04:45.958 --> 1:04:48.375
I don't think this is what
romantic comedy writers would

1:04:48.375 --> 1:04:49.917
call a "meet cute."

1:04:52.333 --> 1:04:54.125
A meet cute?

1:04:54.125 --> 1:04:55.583
Yes.

1:04:55.583 --> 1:04:58.292
You know, when the boy
meets the girl in the movie.

1:04:58.292 --> 1:05:01.250
She's having an online romance
with him, but doesn't know it.

1:05:01.250 --> 1:05:05.083
Or he's a widow who
goes on the radio

1:05:05.083 --> 1:05:06.750
and she falls in
love with his voice.

1:05:06.750 --> 1:05:10.958
Or, well, you know.

1:05:10.958 --> 1:05:15.667
I mean, what like a Tom
Hanks-Meg Ryan kind of thing?

1:05:15.667 --> 1:05:17.542
Yes, exactly.

1:05:17.542 --> 1:05:18.250
OK.

1:05:18.250 --> 1:05:18.667
For sure.

1:05:18.667 --> 1:05:19.500
OK.

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:20.208
That shit's crazy.

1:05:20.208 --> 1:05:21.583
Yeah.

1:05:21.583 --> 1:05:23.292
Some people don't even
think that a triple murder

1:05:23.292 --> 1:05:25.083
is that romantic.

1:05:25.083 --> 1:05:26.042
I know.

1:05:26.042 --> 1:05:28.042
I guess some people don't.

1:05:28.042 --> 1:05:31.333
That's why we're so
right for each other.

1:05:31.333 --> 1:05:33.458
There aren't many people
capable of accomplishing

1:05:33.458 --> 1:05:34.583
what we've done together.

1:05:34.583 --> 1:05:37.375
That's damn right.

1:05:42.167 --> 1:05:45.208
That's why I feel so bad.

1:05:47.625 --> 1:05:49.083
Bad?

1:05:49.083 --> 1:05:50.708
Why?

1:05:50.708 --> 1:05:53.208
You might've noticed that
it's getting a bit difficult

1:05:53.208 --> 1:05:54.250
to move your extremities.

1:05:56.125 --> 1:05:58.375
I put a little something
in your champagne.

1:06:01.458 --> 1:06:03.042
I'm sorry, but I
still need someone

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:04.417
to blame the Picasso on.

1:06:04.417 --> 1:06:07.750
And, well, Blain is
buried in the rose garden.

1:06:07.750 --> 1:06:08.333
So--

1:06:10.750 --> 1:06:14.958
Was it-- was this
really necessary?

1:06:17.375 --> 1:06:20.417
I think so.

1:06:20.417 --> 1:06:21.500
I can't feel my body.

1:06:25.667 --> 1:06:29.083
You can still feel
your mouth, apparently.

1:06:29.083 --> 1:06:30.417
Psych.

1:06:37.833 --> 1:06:42.250
I don't drink champagne.

1:06:42.250 --> 1:06:43.458
What do you mean?

1:06:43.458 --> 1:06:46.208
I saw you drink it all day.

1:06:46.208 --> 1:06:47.667
You should pay more attention.

1:06:47.667 --> 1:06:50.375
I actually didn't eat
or drink a single thing

1:06:50.375 --> 1:06:52.208
since I've been here.

1:06:52.208 --> 1:06:53.667
Thank you.

1:06:53.667 --> 1:06:54.625
Am I?

1:06:54.625 --> 1:06:56.083
I'm good with this.

1:06:56.083 --> 1:06:58.458
To us.

1:06:58.458 --> 1:07:00.083
Well, the police
will never believe

1:07:00.083 --> 1:07:02.500
that I could've disarmed him.

1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:04.208
Why is that?

1:07:04.208 --> 1:07:08.875
Because, one second--

1:07:08.875 --> 1:07:09.458
OK.

1:07:21.625 --> 1:07:28.458
Because I intend to drink now.

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:30.625
I have no idea
what you're saying.

1:07:30.625 --> 1:07:37.208
I said- I intend to drink now.

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:39.333
There's something really
distracting in your mouth.

1:07:39.333 --> 1:07:41.292
I just can't.

1:07:41.292 --> 1:07:44.167
You're killing recalling the
fucking moment..

1:07:44.167 --> 1:07:45.208
Huh?

1:07:45.208 --> 1:07:46.667
Fuck.

1:07:46.667 --> 1:07:48.583
I don't--

1:07:48.583 --> 1:07:52.458
Because I intend to drink now.

1:07:54.125 --> 1:07:55.250
Oh, you're a vampire.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:56.125
Good.

1:07:56.125 --> 1:07:56.750
You picked up on that.

1:07:56.750 --> 1:07:57.667
Yes.

1:07:57.667 --> 1:07:58.583
Finally.

1:07:58.583 --> 1:07:59.750
Thank you.

1:07:59.750 --> 1:08:02.208
I had to put this
shit for you to--

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:02.750
you get it.

1:08:02.750 --> 1:08:03.417
I'm a vampire.

1:08:03.417 --> 1:08:04.333
Right?

1:08:04.333 --> 1:08:05.375
Yes.

1:08:05.375 --> 1:08:05.792
I can put this in my pocket now.

1:08:05.792 --> 1:08:06.417
Yeah?

1:08:06.417 --> 1:08:07.500
Yeah.

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.625
Sorry.

1:08:08.625 --> 1:08:12.583
Now, I don't know
how I missed it.

1:08:12.583 --> 1:08:13.250
Yes.

1:08:13.250 --> 1:08:14.833
Yes.

1:08:14.833 --> 1:08:18.833
Hey, you know how I said I slit
the Babcocks' throats earlier?

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:19.792
Bit their throats.

1:08:19.792 --> 1:08:21.167
Fucking bit those throats.

1:08:21.167 --> 1:08:21.875
You bit them.

1:08:21.875 --> 1:08:23.458
You want to know why?

1:08:23.458 --> 1:08:24.375
You want to know why?

1:08:24.375 --> 1:08:25.500
I do.

1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:26.625
Because that's how
I roll, brother.

1:08:26.625 --> 1:08:27.875
That's how I roll.

1:08:27.875 --> 1:08:29.833
I bite throats.

1:08:29.833 --> 1:08:31.708
Well, this is perfect.

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:34.500
Now, you can turn
me into a vampire

1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:38.292
and we can keep killing and
killing for all eternity.

1:08:41.542 --> 1:08:43.167
That shit would be dope.

1:08:43.167 --> 1:08:43.583
Mhm.

1:08:51.292 --> 1:09:00.208
But, unfortunately, nah.

1:09:00.208 --> 1:09:02.125
I'm too much of a
commitment-phobe.

1:09:04.583 --> 1:09:06.208
Yeah.

1:09:06.208 --> 1:09:07.583
Couldn't have you around
like that, not too much, not

1:09:07.583 --> 1:09:08.292
too much.

1:09:08.292 --> 1:09:08.667
Oh, shit.

1:09:08.667 --> 1:09:09.292
No.

1:09:13.333 --> 1:09:14.292
But I'll tell you what.

1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:19.875
I'll keep that
summoning candle shit

1:09:19.875 --> 1:09:23.208
and I'll summon you
back, from time to time,

1:09:23.208 --> 1:09:26.500
like it's a booty call, like
a vamp and chill or some shit.

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:27.250
Yeah.

1:09:27.250 --> 1:09:27.875
Yeah.

1:09:27.875 --> 1:09:29.333
We could do that.

1:09:29.333 --> 1:09:30.750
We could do that.

1:09:30.750 --> 1:09:32.958
We could.

1:09:32.958 --> 1:09:37.375
So you do care something for me.

1:09:37.375 --> 1:09:41.333
I knew we had a connection.

1:09:45.542 --> 1:09:47.458
What?

1:09:47.458 --> 1:09:52.292
You just so happened to have
a wooden fucking stake on you?

1:09:52.292 --> 1:09:55.000
I lied about my last name.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.750
It isn't Nelson.

1:09:56.750 --> 1:09:58.875
It's Van Helsing.

1:09:58.875 --> 1:10:00.000
Oh, of course.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.458
My family has been
luring vampires

1:10:02.458 --> 1:10:04.667
to their death for centuries.

1:10:04.667 --> 1:10:06.875
Is that really necessary?

1:10:06.875 --> 1:10:07.500
Quite.

1:10:10.833 --> 1:10:11.958
Am I out of blood?

1:10:11.958 --> 1:10:14.667
I might be out of blood.

1:10:14.667 --> 1:10:15.708
You can die now.

1:10:17.875 --> 1:10:18.875
No.

1:10:18.875 --> 1:10:20.417
I've got a little blood left.

1:10:20.417 --> 1:10:22.375
I have to bleed out first.

1:10:22.375 --> 1:10:22.750
Welp.

1:10:25.958 --> 1:10:27.583
It's such a skinny stake.

1:10:27.583 --> 1:10:30.750
What a slow death
you've appointed me to.

1:10:30.750 --> 1:10:33.333
It's been fun.

1:10:33.333 --> 1:10:33.833
Yes.

1:10:33.833 --> 1:10:34.750
Thank you.

1:10:34.750 --> 1:10:36.083
At least you say that.

1:10:36.083 --> 1:10:37.375
God, compliment me while
I die, why don't you?

1:10:37.375 --> 1:10:38.042
Is it 11:00 already?

1:10:38.042 --> 1:10:40.750
Wow.

1:10:43.542 --> 1:10:45.083
This is the final straw.

1:10:45.083 --> 1:10:46.583
Ghosts I was OK with.

1:10:46.583 --> 1:10:48.625
I even begrudgingly
accepted zombies.

1:10:48.625 --> 1:10:52.417
But Kung Fu zombies and Marilyn
Monroe and now a vampire?

1:10:52.417 --> 1:10:53.833
And Van Helsing.

1:10:53.833 --> 1:10:55.000
Van Helsing?

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.708
And how many times
do you think you

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:59.292
can shock an audience with
a supposedly dead character

1:10:59.292 --> 1:11:01.083
suddenly springing up?

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.000
This is just bad writing.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.917
This is 10 pounds of
shit in a 5 pounds bag.

1:11:05.917 --> 1:11:08.083
I'm for scrapping the whole
thing and starting over.

1:11:08.083 --> 1:11:09.708
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:11:09.708 --> 1:11:11.583
You don't know a good
thing when you see it.

1:11:11.583 --> 1:11:15.667
This screenplay could
be our meal ticket.

1:11:15.667 --> 1:11:17.083
Oh, I see.

1:11:17.083 --> 1:11:19.500
You were just pretending
to collaborate on a play.

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:23.333
This whole time, you were
writing your cheap exploitation

1:11:23.333 --> 1:11:24.750
film for the mindless masses.

1:11:24.750 --> 1:11:27.375
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

1:11:27.375 --> 1:11:28.583
I'm deleting the whole thing.

1:11:28.583 --> 1:11:30.500
Oh, no you are not, my friend.

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:31.500
No, no.

1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:32.458
Do not hit that delete key.

1:11:33.042 --> 1:11:33.625
Dammit, Charlie.

1:11:33.625 --> 1:11:34.625
Don't make me do this.

1:11:49.625 --> 1:11:52.583
"Damn it, Charlie.

1:11:52.583 --> 1:11:53.833
Don't make me do this."

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:07.083
Knock, knock, honey.

1:12:07.083 --> 1:12:09.417
I'm kind of working here.

1:12:09.417 --> 1:12:10.458
Oh.

1:12:10.458 --> 1:12:12.000
Well, I didn't hear any typing.

1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.417
So I thought that it was OK.

1:12:14.417 --> 1:12:16.500
Whether you hear me
typing or whether you

1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:19.625
don't hear me typing,
whatever the fuck you hear--

1:12:19.625 --> 1:12:21.792
Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

1:12:21.792 --> 1:12:22.500
Very good.

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:29.500
Well, at least you're not
typing "All work and no play

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:33.750
make George a dull boy."

1:12:33.750 --> 1:12:36.083
Yeah.

1:12:36.083 --> 1:12:37.000
No.

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.667
Thank heaven for that.

1:12:38.667 --> 1:12:41.083
How's the writing going today?

1:12:41.083 --> 1:12:44.000
Well, to be honest, I've
been fighting with myself

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.458
the whole day.

1:12:46.458 --> 1:12:51.708
It's that old art versus
commerce argument.

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:52.792
Yeah.

1:12:52.792 --> 1:12:53.583
Yeah.

1:12:53.583 --> 1:12:54.000
Exactly.

1:12:57.667 --> 1:12:58.917
Bridgette?

1:12:58.917 --> 1:13:00.500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:02.417
Are you basing a
character on me?

1:13:02.417 --> 1:13:04.875
Just the name.

1:13:04.875 --> 1:13:06.875
So she's nothing like me?

1:13:06.875 --> 1:13:10.000
Unless you're a total sociopath
with no redeeming qualities,

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:10.958
then no.

1:13:10.958 --> 1:13:13.458
She is nothing like you.

1:13:13.458 --> 1:13:14.125
Oh, yes.

1:13:14.125 --> 1:13:17.000
That would be me.

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:21.250
You know, honey, I was thinking.

1:13:21.250 --> 1:13:25.583
Maybe you should think about
getting someone, another writer

1:13:25.583 --> 1:13:26.458
to work with you.

1:13:26.458 --> 1:13:29.458
You mean, collaborate?

1:13:29.458 --> 1:13:31.083
I'm deleting the whole thing.

1:13:31.083 --> 1:13:31.958
Damn it, Charlie.

1:13:31.958 --> 1:13:33.250
Don't make me do this.

1:13:33.250 --> 1:13:36.125
I don't know if that'd
work out so well.

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:39.042
But at least then you
wouldn't be, you know,

1:13:39.042 --> 1:13:42.125
spending all your time cooped
up down here, all alone,

1:13:42.125 --> 1:13:45.583
in a room, talking to yourself.

1:13:45.583 --> 1:13:46.125
OK.

1:13:46.125 --> 1:13:47.500
You know what?

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:50.000
I'll consider it
for my next project.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:50.875
OK.

1:13:50.875 --> 1:13:52.000
It's just a thought.

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.542
I mean, you know
I worry about you.

1:13:53.542 --> 1:13:55.083
You don't have to
worry about me.

1:13:55.083 --> 1:13:58.208
Actually, I think I've really
written something good here

1:13:58.208 --> 1:14:01.125
and has commercial value.

1:14:01.125 --> 1:14:02.250
You've said that before.

1:14:02.250 --> 1:14:02.875
I know.

1:14:02.875 --> 1:14:03.833
I know.

1:14:03.833 --> 1:14:04.875
But this one is different.

1:14:04.875 --> 1:14:09.125
This one has, well, everything.

1:14:09.125 --> 1:14:11.083
Well, I hope so.

1:14:11.083 --> 1:14:13.208
We could use some money.

1:14:13.208 --> 1:14:16.167
I know.

1:14:16.167 --> 1:14:17.667
What about your dad?

1:14:17.667 --> 1:14:19.625
Do you think, like,
he'd maybe loan us some

1:14:19.625 --> 1:14:21.625
till I can sell this?

1:14:21.625 --> 1:14:22.708
Oh, boy.

1:14:22.708 --> 1:14:24.500
My father?

1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:25.583
You must be kidding?

1:14:25.583 --> 1:14:28.625
I mean, you know what?

1:14:28.625 --> 1:14:29.500
I know.

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:31.292
Let's steal his Picasso.

1:14:31.292 --> 1:14:32.583
Oh, now, there's a thought.

1:14:32.583 --> 1:14:34.958
Hmm?

1:14:34.958 --> 1:14:35.792
All right.

1:14:35.792 --> 1:14:36.542
Coming to dinner?

1:14:36.542 --> 1:14:37.167
Yeah.

1:14:37.167 --> 1:14:38.542
In a little bit.

1:14:38.542 --> 1:14:41.083
I just want to put
one thing in here

1:14:41.083 --> 1:14:42.875
before it falls out my ears.

1:14:42.875 --> 1:14:46.875
You know, the kids would like
to see their father sometime.

1:14:46.875 --> 1:14:51.208
Bridgette, my darling, love
of my life, I'll be right up.

1:14:51.208 --> 1:14:53.667
But I'll bash your brains in.

1:14:53.667 --> 1:14:56.083
I'll bash your fucking
brains right in.

1:14:56.083 --> 1:14:57.125
That was good.

1:14:57.125 --> 1:14:57.750
That was--

1:14:57.750 --> 1:14:59.292
Thanks.

1:14:59.292 --> 1:15:00.917
That was good, but I don't
think you quite have it exactly.

1:15:00.917 --> 1:15:01.833
All right.

1:15:01.833 --> 1:15:03.583
I'll keep working on it.

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:05.708
And I got to work on this.

1:15:05.708 --> 1:15:07.042
But I will be right up.

1:15:07.042 --> 1:15:09.167
Tell the kids I'll be
up in time for dessert.

1:15:09.167 --> 1:15:10.917
OK?

1:15:10.917 --> 1:15:13.083
I just really need to get
this down before I forget it.

1:15:13.083 --> 1:15:13.792
OK.

1:15:13.792 --> 1:15:14.167
All right.

1:15:23.292 --> 1:15:24.708
Love you.

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:27.083
Love you.

1:15:27.083 --> 1:15:31.792
Kung Fu Zombies, the screenplay.

1:15:32.375 --> 1:15:33.750
We fade in--

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.750
What the hell just happened?

1:16:04.750 --> 1:16:06.167
Where am?

1:16:06.167 --> 1:16:10.208
What-- why does everything
seem so much smaller?

1:16:10.208 --> 1:16:13.000
Am I in a dollhouse
version of my house?

1:16:16.708 --> 1:16:22.083
Are those credits rolling
by outside my smaller house?

1:16:22.083 --> 1:16:23.625
Whoa.

1:16:23.625 --> 1:16:25.250
How the hell did
you get in here?

1:16:25.250 --> 1:16:26.125
All right.

1:16:26.125 --> 1:16:27.417
George, George, relax.

1:16:27.417 --> 1:16:28.750
I know this is a little
freaky right now.

1:16:28.750 --> 1:16:29.750
Yeah.

1:16:29.750 --> 1:16:30.625
This is actually a movie.

1:16:30.625 --> 1:16:31.042
What?

1:16:34.417 --> 1:16:37.000
I was writing a movie.

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:37.917
I know that.

1:16:37.917 --> 1:16:39.333
Not exactly.

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:43.292
You're actually a character
in a movie I directed.

1:16:43.292 --> 1:16:43.958
Hold on.

1:16:43.958 --> 1:16:44.958
Hold on.

1:16:44.958 --> 1:16:46.708
Explain to me what's going on.

1:16:46.708 --> 1:16:48.000
Guys.

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:49.125
Guys, guys, kill the
credits for a second.

1:16:49.125 --> 1:16:49.500
Oh.

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:50.083
Thank you.

1:16:50.083 --> 1:16:51.125
That's very unsettling.

1:16:51.125 --> 1:16:51.792
Oh.

1:16:51.792 --> 1:16:52.292
Thank you.

1:16:52.292 --> 1:16:53.000
Thank you.

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:53.917
Thank you.

1:16:53.917 --> 1:16:54.333
That was so unsettling.

1:16:54.333 --> 1:16:54.958
Yeah.

1:16:54.958 --> 1:16:56.708
Yeah.

1:16:56.708 --> 1:16:57.667
You should feel like you got
a little bit more breathing

1:16:57.667 --> 1:16:58.208
room, a normal size again.

1:16:58.208 --> 1:16:59.292
Yeah, yeah.

1:16:59.292 --> 1:17:01.458
So what's going on?

1:17:01.458 --> 1:17:02.833
OK.

1:17:02.833 --> 1:17:04.292
So like I was saying,
you're actually

1:17:04.292 --> 1:17:07.125
a character that was written
by my father for a play

1:17:07.125 --> 1:17:10.458
that he created and then
I turned into a movie.

1:17:10.458 --> 1:17:13.917
You're played by an actor
named Maurice LeMarche.

1:17:13.917 --> 1:17:16.250
I'm not familiar with his work.

1:17:16.250 --> 1:17:17.833
Voice actor?

1:17:17.833 --> 1:17:18.750
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:17:18.750 --> 1:17:19.417
Pinky and the Brain.

1:17:19.417 --> 1:17:20.458
Yeah, yeah.

1:17:20.458 --> 1:17:21.042
He was a friend of my father's.

1:17:21.042 --> 1:17:21.667
Oh.

1:17:21.667 --> 1:17:22.375
Yeah.

1:17:22.375 --> 1:17:23.125
Your dad wrote on that?

1:17:23.125 --> 1:17:23.917
Yeah, yeah.

1:17:23.917 --> 1:17:25.083
Yes, yes, yes.

1:17:25.083 --> 1:17:26.750
I liked his episodes
particularly.

1:17:26.750 --> 1:17:32.250
So you're saying then that
I, George the screenwriter

1:17:32.250 --> 1:17:34.958
and playwright, am not real.

1:17:34.958 --> 1:17:36.375
Well, I mean, are any of us?

1:17:36.375 --> 1:17:38.167
I'm actually not
really the director.

1:17:38.167 --> 1:17:40.125
I'm a character
named "The Director"

1:17:40.125 --> 1:17:42.958
that the director is actually
playing inside of his own movie

1:17:42.958 --> 1:17:44.250
that was written as a play.

1:17:44.250 --> 1:17:46.833
I mean, I was
almost really recast

1:17:46.833 --> 1:17:48.708
because I couldn't
learn my lines.

1:17:48.708 --> 1:17:50.125
Wow.

1:17:50.125 --> 1:17:51.708
That's got to be a comedown.

1:17:51.708 --> 1:17:52.500
I know.

1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:54.083
I really feel for the actor.

1:17:54.083 --> 1:17:57.750
So are you telling me
I'm just words on a page?

1:17:57.750 --> 1:17:59.458
Words on a page.

1:17:59.458 --> 1:18:05.083
So when the movie ends,
do I just disappear

1:18:05.083 --> 1:18:07.542
and I'm gone for good?

1:18:07.542 --> 1:18:08.333
No.

1:18:08.333 --> 1:18:09.208
No.

1:18:09.208 --> 1:18:10.208
I'm not saying that.

1:18:10.208 --> 1:18:13.042
Some works, they last forever.

1:18:13.042 --> 1:18:14.417
Nothing's ever
really gone for good.

1:18:17.917 --> 1:18:18.333
All right.

1:18:18.333 --> 1:18:19.167
Cut.

1:18:19.167 --> 1:18:19.833
Cut it.

1:18:19.833 --> 1:18:20.208
Cut.
