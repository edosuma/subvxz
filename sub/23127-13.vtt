00:01.100 --> 00:03.023
(Sally) Previously,
on "Being Human"...

00:03.070 --> 00:04.799
No one in our world is gonna
have anything to do

00:04.830 --> 00:06.036
with Aidan Waite.

00:06.070 --> 00:09.404
I am banished from all
vampires under penalty of death.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.908
I have to go back.

00:10.940 --> 00:15.173
As long as we keep running,
your life is in danger.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.747
(Sally) Ghosts have
started appearing.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.544
I'm trapped, forever.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.947
(man) Because some ghost
just took the wrong door.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.142
Limbo, that's
what we're calling it.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.783
Josh, I know how to
lift this curse.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.811
It's about finding
the man who turned you.

00:27.860 --> 00:32.149
If you find him and you
kill him, you're free.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.623
(screaming)

00:34.660 --> 00:36.697
(crashing)

00:38.470 --> 00:39.665
I will protect you.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.429
It's too late.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.564
I loved you
enough, Josh.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.409
You just never
believed it.

00:51.950 --> 00:56.183
<i>*Xk</i>

01:05.030 --> 01:07.089
(Sally) I was a good child.

01:07.130 --> 01:08.359
I did my homework.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.595
Ate my vegetables.

01:09.630 --> 01:10.620
Josh.

01:10.670 --> 01:14.368
Kissed my mother
goodnight.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.939
Let's not
go in there.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.574
I'm here now.

01:24.610 --> 01:26.442
Can't just leave, how
would that look?

01:26.480 --> 01:31.782
It will look
smart, Josh.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.279
The easiest person for
them to hate right now is you.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.925
(crying)

01:53.010 --> 01:54.899
I was patient.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.739
I was kind.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.475
But I'm starting to
think that good things

01:59.520 --> 02:02.683
don't actually come to
those who wait.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.109
(crying)

02:06.260 --> 02:10.526
We behaved as well as we could
for as long as we could.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.757
And now it's time
to try something else.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.895
Can I help you?

02:19.540 --> 02:21.668
I'm sorry.

02:25.870 --> 02:31.707
You would've been content
to never see me again.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.741
Hey, if this is gonna
be the last time we talk,

02:33.780 --> 02:37.080
can we at least have some
satisfying answers?

02:37.120 --> 02:40.613
Come on, please, just give me
something to make sense of this.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.889
Sense?

02:41.920 --> 02:44.252
Logic?

02:44.290 --> 02:45.325
None of
that matters.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.749
You know that.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.690
Never forget how
old Mother and I are.

02:50.730 --> 02:53.597
Matters like this are
primal with her.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.167
Yeah, like
love is primal?

02:57.210 --> 02:59.599
Like survival
is primal.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.529
I'm sorry.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.741
I was weak.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.078
See, she's made you
believe that you are,

03:05.110 --> 03:07.750
but I know that we could've
been strong.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.817
If you had just held on
just a little while longer,

03:09.850 --> 03:13.059
you would've known...

03:13.090 --> 03:15.286
that I did it.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.688
I-I secured asylum
with the Dutch.

03:18.730 --> 03:20.289
I didn't
doubt you would.

03:20.330 --> 03:25.530
Well, then why--
Why would you give up?

03:25.570 --> 03:30.269
Just...
just tell me the truth.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.406
Because you would've paid for
my indiscretions with your life.

03:36.380 --> 03:39.839
I told you--
I tried to warn you.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.314
Mother wouldn't
let me run.

03:41.350 --> 03:44.911
She wouldn't rest until
I came back to her,

03:44.950 --> 03:46.714
until you
were dead.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.822
You're safe
now, Aidan.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.158
That's why
I came back.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.759
You're free.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.065
After all this...

04:04.110 --> 04:08.934
After decades, do you
really think that freedom,

04:08.980 --> 04:10.209
freedom won
like this,

04:10.250 --> 04:14.972
do you think it really means
anything to me without you?

04:15.020 --> 04:16.112
Huh?

04:16.149 --> 04:18.141
No, I don't accept
your conditions.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.285
<i>*Xk</i>

04:21.320 --> 04:22.651
Aidan.

04:22.690 --> 04:26.524
I told you
I was weak.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.756
You're my weakness.

04:30.230 --> 04:34.098
You can't ask me
to watch you die.

04:49.850 --> 04:52.512
- We came
screaming into this world.

04:54.820 --> 04:59.360
How can we possibly leave
it without a fight?

05:09.540 --> 05:12.305
(Josh) You know what I was
thinking on the drive down here?

05:12.340 --> 05:15.435
(Emily
Hmm?)

05:15.480 --> 05:19.644
For most people,
going home is a safety net,

05:19.680 --> 05:23.719
a place to hide until
the worst passes.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.220
And there's no
hiding here for me anymore.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.555
I'm the monster they
wanna keep out.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.929
Look.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.961
People are
in shock.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.569
They're
grieving.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.738
Which is not to say
that you're not...

05:48.780 --> 05:52.569
No, you
are right.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.576
I shouldn't
have come.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.975
It was...

05:56.020 --> 05:57.909
selfish.

05:59.420 --> 06:02.424
I thought I could
redeem myself to them.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.350
I was so close to
redeeming myself to her.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.028
But you did.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.051
I saw you two
together. What you saw

06:09.100 --> 06:10.363
was me holding
on to something

06:10.400 --> 06:12.994
that was never
gonna happen.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.364
I can't imagine how horrible
it must've been for you

06:17.410 --> 06:20.903
being there.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.341
But you
didn't do this.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.348
You don't understand.

06:25.380 --> 06:29.214
This would never have
happened if I wasn't how I am.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.287
Josh.

06:31.320 --> 06:36.190
You had no control
over the situation.

06:36.220 --> 06:40.293
Don't let something random
cloud the truth.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.519
(phone vibrating)

06:48.600 --> 06:49.965
What is it?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.865
I don't know.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.336
<i>*Xk</i>

07:07.360 --> 07:08.850
Josh.

07:08.890 --> 07:09.857
I would've
come sooner.

07:09.890 --> 07:11.380
I just got the messages.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.591
What?

07:12.630 --> 07:13.620
Oh, God.

07:13.660 --> 07:16.027
You're still
my emergency contact.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.960
Yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.399
I'm sorry.

07:19.430 --> 07:20.534
I never
changed it.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.265
No, don't be sorry.

07:23.770 --> 07:26.307
Was it the,
uh...

07:26.340 --> 07:28.001
Eclipse?

07:28.040 --> 07:30.407
Yeah.

07:30.450 --> 07:35.547
I was here,
working.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.514
Kaufman
let me back.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.015
It's a concussion?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.209
They're worried
about swelling?

07:41.260 --> 07:45.686
That's why
I'm in observation.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.927
I tried to make it down to
the isolation room,

07:48.960 --> 07:52.328
but on that
last flight of stairs...

07:52.370 --> 07:54.964
Yeah.

07:58.840 --> 08:03.778
Josh, I'm sorry.

08:03.810 --> 08:07.246
I heard what
happened.

08:09.550 --> 08:11.518
I was...

08:11.550 --> 08:13.985
I was gonna tell
her the truth.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.800
And then
she saw me.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.993
You can't blame
yourself,

08:23.030 --> 08:25.567
Who do you
want me to blame-- Ray?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.404
I've thought
about it.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.408
If there were
ever a time...

08:37.549 --> 08:41.817
Grab the gun, go
to his house...

08:41.850 --> 08:45.081
And then what?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.418
Kill him,
free myself.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.521
And leave you
where?

08:50.560 --> 08:53.154
Cursed.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.592
And I promised you I
would find a way to fix this.

08:57.630 --> 09:02.466
I can't do
this to you.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.901
You haven't.

09:04.940 --> 09:07.034
I've made my
decision.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.141
But you don't know
everything you need to know.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.579
What do
you mean?

09:11.610 --> 09:17.447
The curse, it's in
the bloodline.

09:17.490 --> 09:22.052
If you kill your maker,
you don't just cure yourself.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.388
You cure whoever
you made.

09:27.760 --> 09:33.233
I wanted you to choose
for you, not for me.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.864
And when you
decided not to kill Ray,

09:35.900 --> 09:38.210
I was relieved,
Josh.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.971
I was.

09:41.010 --> 09:45.902
I wouldn't want you to become a
man who could kill another man.

09:45.950 --> 09:49.045
I know what that
would do to you.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.082
Please, Josh.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.487
You can't.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.579
Promise me.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.850
I promise.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.199
(Sally) Danny called it "limbo."

10:05.230 --> 10:07.995
No, what--
Danny?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.394
Yeah.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.909
That happened.

10:11.940 --> 10:16.776
About limbo, he
told me a way in.

10:16.810 --> 10:21.714
I take another
ghost's door.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.811
Just so you're clear,
that ghost goes crazy.

10:24.850 --> 10:28.809
I mean, that's what
happens, right?

10:28.860 --> 10:32.751
Did Danny happen to
mention how to get out?

10:37.400 --> 10:38.959
So I give up?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.264
The way Suren
gave up?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.036
I just...

10:44.070 --> 10:45.504
I need to make
it right.

10:45.540 --> 10:49.204
She thinks that
she's done me a favor.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.347
Maybe it's better you two were
only together for a few months.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.439
It was a little
longer than that.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.139
<i>*Xk</i>

10:59.190 --> 11:01.215
I'm here.

11:01.260 --> 11:05.424
I didn't forget.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.599
Suren.

11:07.630 --> 11:10.395
(Mother) Useless
and sentimental.

11:15.770 --> 11:16.737
Forgive me.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.602
I thought that
you were away.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.574
So you intrude
on my estate?

11:20.610 --> 11:22.840
Only once a year.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.405
On the day
of her burial.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.010
My daughter can't see
you or hear you.

11:27.050 --> 11:31.248
You think she can sense
you, standing above her grave,

11:31.290 --> 11:34.112
that she takes comfort
from that?

11:34.160 --> 11:38.552
Respectfully, but
it's been 5 years.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.957
The longer she stays
underground...

11:41.000 --> 11:44.868
No one's mind can
handle that.

11:44.900 --> 11:48.564
If you dig her up now,
she'd be grateful.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.968
You think I'm doing
this to hurt her?

11:57.010 --> 11:58.648
(banging)

12:08.520 --> 12:11.080
I'm sorry
about Julia.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.891
I'm guessing it's not a good
thing that you're back here.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.978
I'm gonna kill Ray.

12:35.980 --> 12:39.211
With a gun,
with Hegeman's gun.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.718
For Nora.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.956
I can cure her if
I kill him.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.186
(Sally)
Josh.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.756
And don't
even try to stop me.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.462
I've made up
my mind.

12:54.570 --> 13:00.577
If you could get Ray
into that shed,

13:00.610 --> 13:02.601
where the twins were...

13:02.640 --> 13:06.349
can you
do that?

13:06.380 --> 13:07.677
I think so, yeah.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.109
Can you do it
tonight?

13:12.420 --> 13:14.650
Good.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.454
I'll meet
you there.

13:16.490 --> 13:19.755
Just as soon as I
kill Mother.

13:19.790 --> 13:22.725
Too many
people have suffered.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.762
She's gotta go.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.695
So you're
helping me.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.469
You want me
to help you, or...

13:33.510 --> 13:36.400
Mmm, I got it.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.706
You two are
totally about to go

13:38.750 --> 13:42.072
on two separate killing
sprees for women.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.509
That is
so hot.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.781
I'm gonna
kill a man.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.298
(horn honking)

13:58.630 --> 14:00.166
(Henry)
Kill Mother?

14:00.200 --> 14:02.294
Are you insane-- Have you
even thought this through?

14:02.340 --> 14:03.364
There's nothing
to think.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.764
She's ruined
enough lives.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.505
But that's not what
this is about.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.008
This is about her
ruining your life!

14:08.040 --> 14:10.702
And Suren's and forcing her to
live a life that she hates.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.639
She walked right
back into that life

14:12.680 --> 14:14.216
and that's because
of me, Henry.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.548
This is suicide.

14:16.580 --> 14:19.288
Not with your help,
it isn't.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.719
My help?

14:20.760 --> 14:21.955
(scoffs)

14:21.990 --> 14:25.858
Of course.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.221
It's too late.

14:27.260 --> 14:30.025
Now that Boston's under control,
Mother's leaving the state,

14:30.070 --> 14:31.299
maybe for years.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.798
Okay, then we'll
think about today.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.138
I don't
see how.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.730
Mother's called the council
to her lake house tonight

14:36.770 --> 14:38.738
before she leaves.

14:38.770 --> 14:41.979
Part going-away party,
part recognizing Suren

14:42.010 --> 14:43.273
as the new leader
of Boston.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.369
That's great, yeah, that's
just like Mother,

14:45.410 --> 14:47.117
congratulate
Suren in the same place

14:47.150 --> 14:49.539
that you've imprisoned
her for 80 years!

14:54.220 --> 14:56.484
Are you gonna
be there?

15:00.830 --> 15:04.994
I've been put
on guard detail.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.362
Good.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.993
Good, then we'll
do it there.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.168
Kill Mother at
her own house,

15:11.210 --> 15:12.905
surrounded by
the entire council?

15:12.940 --> 15:14.271
Pretty much.

15:14.310 --> 15:16.574
You'd be dead before you got
within spitting distance of her.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.250
Not if she never
sees us coming.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.447
Oh...

15:26.490 --> 15:27.980
The faithful one.

15:30.090 --> 15:33.424
You're early
this year.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.054
Or is it late?

15:37.830 --> 15:42.097
25 years underground and still
you cling to your humanity.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.700
I can feel it!

15:44.740 --> 15:47.038
It's disgusting!

15:50.050 --> 15:52.644
Uh, Mother,
you just fed.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.216
Let me walk you back
to the house.

15:54.250 --> 15:59.541
My daughter fell to
pieces over a love affair!

15:59.590 --> 16:04.380
She slaughtered a human
in front of humans.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.320
Yes, she did.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.467
And you've made
her pay dearly for it.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.662
The punishment is only
enough when she realizes

16:13.700 --> 16:17.102
it isn't punishment
at all.

16:17.140 --> 16:20.405
But Suren's
mastering her emotions.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.205
She's getting
stronger.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.469
Do you hear me?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.625
No.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.298
Not
the house.

16:44.030 --> 16:47.364
<i>*Xk</i>

16:56.840 --> 17:00.276
Root cellar.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.573
This is where
you sleep?

17:02.620 --> 17:05.042
I prefer
it here.

17:05.089 --> 17:10.926
The dark, the quiet,
the sweetness of blood.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.852
This is how I spend
Suren's anniversary.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.925
Drinking.

17:17.970 --> 17:22.635
Doesn't have to be
an anniversary.

17:22.670 --> 17:25.537
If you wanted to, you
could be with her today.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.971
Did you have
a child, Aidan?

17:28.010 --> 17:31.776
As a human.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.472
Yeah--
Yeah, I did.

17:34.520 --> 17:38.184
Then you know what
that love is.

17:38.220 --> 17:40.985
Irrational.

17:41.020 --> 17:45.184
Animal.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.551
So strong,
it weakens you.

17:49.460 --> 17:54.660
When I gave birth to
Suren, for a moment,

17:54.700 --> 17:58.603
I couldn't breathe
for looking at her.

17:58.640 --> 18:03.771
Human mother,
human child.

18:03.810 --> 18:07.246
And then...

18:07.280 --> 18:10.284
I gave
her eternity.

18:14.190 --> 18:19.583
Something that my son taught me
is that when I punished him...

18:22.200 --> 18:23.998
He only
rebelled more.

18:28.370 --> 18:33.308
But I learned that he
would do anything for me,

18:33.340 --> 18:34.933
out of love.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.640
You know what
savaging is?

18:41.120 --> 18:45.819
Amongst animals?

18:45.850 --> 18:51.186
A tiger licks the afterbirth
from her newborn litter,

18:51.230 --> 18:55.428
rousing
them to life.

18:55.460 --> 19:01.160
And if one cub
doesn't rouse...

19:01.200 --> 19:05.410
she may Kkill it
and eat it.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.371
The weak one
who won't survive.

19:11.410 --> 19:14.641
If you're so concerned
that Suren is weak,

19:14.680 --> 19:18.639
why are you trying
so hard to break her?

19:18.690 --> 19:23.230
Problem is,
I only have one.

19:27.130 --> 19:30.760
Aidan...

19:30.800 --> 19:32.996
Don't come back
here ever again.

19:34.870 --> 19:40.070
<i>*Xk</i>

19:44.910 --> 19:46.639
The only time that Mother
is weak enough to attack

19:46.680 --> 19:50.116
is when she's
sleeping in that cellar.

19:50.150 --> 19:53.256
What about
the guards?

19:53.290 --> 19:55.509
Well, you're gonna have to take
them out before I get there.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.621
And then you're gonna
have to leave me a signal.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.025
Here's what
you're gonna do.

20:00.060 --> 20:02.358
You tie this rag to
a tree branch

20:02.400 --> 20:05.370
near Mother's
cellar door.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.893
And then, Henry, you just
get the hell out of there.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.635
Hey,
everyone wins.

20:10.670 --> 20:13.503
We take care of Mother, we
all get what we want.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.578
You get
what you want.

20:16.610 --> 20:19.841
I'm beginning to wonder if
you even know what I want.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.712
I gave
you my blood.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.684
Now you have to give
this to me.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.554
Sticking with this plan,
it's the only help that I need.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.727
Now, can you do
that for me?

20:37.200 --> 20:39.498
What if you lose?

20:39.530 --> 20:45.162
Well, then I want you to
know that I am very proud

20:45.210 --> 20:47.133
of the man that
you've become.,

20:48.480 --> 20:51.745
<i>*Xk</i>

21:02.590 --> 21:05.287
Does it have
to be the gun?

21:05.330 --> 21:07.458
He just has to
die at my hands.

21:07.500 --> 21:11.095
Because I was thinking,
what's he got going on

21:11.130 --> 21:13.633
in that landscaping truck?

21:13.670 --> 21:16.492
What, you think
I should...

21:16.540 --> 21:17.939
mow Ray down?

21:17.970 --> 21:19.233
I'm just saying if
you're bad with the gun...

21:19.270 --> 21:21.876
I'm not bad with
the gun, okay?

21:21.910 --> 21:23.571
Do you have any idea how many
gang members are kids

21:23.610 --> 21:24.702
who've never
even touched a gun

21:24.750 --> 21:26.309
and they kill people
all the time?

21:26.350 --> 21:28.944
No, that's
fantastic logic.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.720
Are you gonna wear
that shirt?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.716
Why?

21:34.760 --> 21:35.989
Because it's my
favorite shirt,

21:36.020 --> 21:38.853
and if you shoot him,
you're gonna have to burn it

21:38.890 --> 21:40.528
because of
the gunpowder.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.959
Evidence or
something.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.058
Right.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.194
Which is why I'm saying,

21:45.230 --> 21:46.425
you should just
hack him up

21:46.470 --> 21:48.734
with some of those
professional garden shears.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.636
Yeah, no, that's
a great idea.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.707
Wildly attacking him
with some rusty shears

21:52.740 --> 21:55.607
is way less messy than
shooting him.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.469
What the hell
am I doing?

22:02.520 --> 22:03.942
I don't know what
the hell I'm doing!

22:03.990 --> 22:06.288
I mean, how-how am I supposed
to get Ray to meet me

22:06.320 --> 22:10.052
in the middle of
the friggin' woods?

22:10.090 --> 22:12.582
I know how.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.995
We have
to hurry.

22:14.030 --> 22:16.795
<i>*Xk</i>

22:20.200 --> 22:21.270
It's just
a flat, Ray.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.961
I could call
a tow.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.104
(Ray)
No, no.

22:24.140 --> 22:25.869
I don't like you
sitting out there like that.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.139
Let me come out.

22:27.170 --> 22:29.537
I'm on the bend,
Bassett Creek Road.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.173
Okay, got it.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.348
Okay.

22:38.390 --> 22:39.539
I'm fine.

22:39.590 --> 22:40.682
It's fine.

23:05.110 --> 23:07.272
I better go.

23:07.310 --> 23:09.813
This has to work.

23:09.850 --> 23:12.649
For everyone's
sake.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.910
But if
it does...

for our one and only hug,

23:40.150 --> 23:44.587
it would be better
if you weren't...

23:44.620 --> 23:48.011
possessing the wife of
the man I'm about to...

23:48.060 --> 23:50.688
I know.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.598
And I mean this in the best way
possible when I say that

23:57.630 --> 23:59.689
I hope I don't
see you again

could be.

was you saw in me,

or didn't.

only see what I see.

You will, sooner
than you know.

26:23.180 --> 26:26.172
At least the joint I
haunt has basic cable.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.110
What are you
doing here?

26:28.150 --> 26:31.711
Mom, do
you love me?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.047
What kind of question
is that?

"Cause I need you
to do something for me.

It's not forever,

You think?

Sally, no--
No!

26:57.750 --> 26:58.808
You're
being silly.

Silly.

27:00.550 --> 27:02.416
I ruin
lives.

27:02.450 --> 27:03.815
Dozens of them.

You stood in front of me
and you wondered

what you could
do to help me?

27:07.390 --> 27:08.858
This is what
you can do.

By ripping
you up?

the only way, Mom!

it and move on.

wanted to help me.

I could not be more
proud of her efforts

29:12.050 --> 29:13.609
to bring Boston
to bear,

29:13.650 --> 29:16.620
which is why I have chosen
tonight to announce Suren

29:16.650 --> 29:19.119
<i>aS my successor.</i>

29:19.150 --> 29:21.881
(murmuring)

29:21.920 --> 29:26.858
Nothing is permanent in
this world, not even us.

29:26.890 --> 29:30.997
It's high time a succession
plan stood in place.

29:31.030 --> 29:34.091
Mother, I don't
know what to say.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.462
Bring him.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.832
<i>*Xk</i>

29:39.870 --> 29:41.429
(Suren)
Aidan!

29:53.550 --> 29:54.711
What is this?

29:57.390 --> 29:59.256
Your finest
moment, dear.

30:04.230 --> 30:06.369
Kill him, Suren...

30:08.640 --> 30:10.699
and your birthright
will be earned.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.816
(Josh)
Over there.

30:32.730 --> 30:34.494
Aidan?

30:34.530 --> 30:35.827
Come on,
come on.

30:35.860 --> 30:37.726
Were you expecting
somebody?

30:41.540 --> 30:42.598
Okay...

30:42.640 --> 30:43.766
If I can just
talk to you...

30:43.800 --> 30:46.531
Shut up!

30:46.570 --> 30:48.004
Get down
on the ground.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.702
Josh.
Get down, now!

30:51.850 --> 30:53.545
Down!

30:58.890 --> 31:01.882
You told me to
leave you be, Josh.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.149
I did that.

31:03.190 --> 31:04.453
You found me.

31:04.490 --> 31:05.958
Shut up--
Shut up!

31:05.990 --> 31:08.152
Look, I never
told you.

31:08.200 --> 31:13.969
Meeting you, your friends,
it made me a different man.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.331
You saw them.

31:15.370 --> 31:19.568
My wife, my kid.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.999
You made me
want a better life.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.678
It's all lies, Ray. No, Josh!

31:23.710 --> 31:26.975
Damn you for pretending like
it could be any different!

31:28.620 --> 31:32.113
The eclipse-- It
knocked you for a loop too.

31:32.150 --> 31:36.280
The eclipse, you,
my fiance.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.788
Nothing
changes, Ray.

31:37.820 --> 31:41.495
No matter what we try to do, no
matter how we try to spin it,

31:41.530 --> 31:43.919
one way or another,
the wolf destroys it all.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.768
And I've been
there, Josh.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.996
We can help
each other.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.498
There's only one way
you can help me.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.339
All T have to
do is kill you

31:53.370 --> 31:57.409
and everyone I've cursed and
they've cursed, they're free.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.475
What are you talking about?

31:58.510 --> 31:59.739
The bloodline, Ray.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.147
The what?

32:02.180 --> 32:05.514
You think killing me is
gonna free you of something,

32:05.550 --> 32:07.382
make you some
sort of hero?

32:07.420 --> 32:11.357
You pull that trigger and
you are the monster, Josh,

32:11.390 --> 32:13.654
not the wolf,
not me!

32:13.690 --> 32:17.126
All this time, I've
been beating myself up...

32:17.160 --> 32:19.128
(growling)

32:19.170 --> 32:20.592
Iiving half a life.

32:20.630 --> 32:22.359
(howling)

32:23.640 --> 32:25.267
1 tried to
find a cure.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.267
(groaning)

32:27.310 --> 32:29.779
I tried to find a
way to make this right.

32:29.810 --> 32:32.006
(crashing)

32:32.050 --> 32:33.939
And all
this time...

32:33.980 --> 32:35.414
(growling)

32:37.350 --> 32:39.182
It was you.

32:42.690 --> 32:44.624
(Nora)
Josh!

32:44.660 --> 32:46.059
(gun fires)

32:50.060 --> 32:51.494
Josh!

32:53.100 --> 32:54.499
(horn honking)

32:56.800 --> 32:58.438
Mom?

32:58.470 --> 32:59.960
You're right.

33:00.010 --> 33:01.603
I should've
been here.

33:07.980 --> 33:11.109
It's fine.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.345
It's
in the past.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.813
I know you're
in pain.

33:14.860 --> 33:19.457
I just wanna make it right,
and I don't know how.

33:21.260 --> 33:25.060
Hey, I am
proud of you.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.499
Seriously?

33:26.530 --> 33:30.990
You are so much stronger
and more selfless now

33:31.040 --> 33:32.838
than you were
when you were alive.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.339
See...
Everyone agrees, Sally.

33:35.380 --> 33:38.441
You're better
with me.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.903
I did terrible
things to get here.

33:40.950 --> 33:45.547
So we make mistakes, and how
we got here was tragic,

33:45.590 --> 33:47.786
- but it still
isn't wrong to say

33:47.820 --> 33:50.949
that I'm looking forward to the
time we have together now.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.195
Your door.

33:59.770 --> 34:01.989
Oh, my God...

34:04.910 --> 34:08.574
Mother, this
isn't necessary.

34:08.610 --> 34:09.804
I've made my
choice.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.739
You have my
complete devotion.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.873
You know that.

34:13.909 --> 34:19.542
Why waste our time
with this heretic?

34:19.590 --> 34:21.478
Because you will never lay
claim to your birthright

34:21.520 --> 34:23.409
as long as you allow
yourself to be held captive

34:23.460 --> 34:25.121
by distractions
such as him!

34:25.159 --> 34:27.150
Suren.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.328
It's okay.

34:30.230 --> 34:31.719
I can't.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.793
Do it.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.638
Kill him,
Suren.

34:39.670 --> 34:41.034
(groaning)

34:41.070 --> 34:42.469
Kill him!

34:42.510 --> 34:43.500
You didn't
call the council here

34:43.540 --> 34:46.146
to watch me succeed,
did you?

34:46.179 --> 34:49.377
You wanted them here
to witness my failure.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.114
Then prove
me wrong.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.118
Prove that
you're worthy.

34:53.150 --> 34:56.949
Prove that I did not put you
into the ground in vain.

34:56.989 --> 35:00.927
Show them all that a
leader, a true leader,

35:00.960 --> 35:03.691
is stronger than
her emotions.

35:07.070 --> 35:08.333
Kill him!

35:09.800 --> 35:12.735
<i>*Xk</i>

35:16.310 --> 35:18.005
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry,

35:24.850 --> 35:26.488
I can't.

I can't.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.151
I'm sorry.

35:33.190 --> 35:34.260

all right.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.223
I understand.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.625
It's over.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.460
(Mother)
Shhh...

35:45.340 --> 35:49.231
I love him,
Mother.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.749
(Mother)
I know.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.999
And I love you.

Oh, no!

36:36.460 --> 36:37.518
No!

36:37.560 --> 36:41.997
She was never
going to be you.

36:42.030 --> 36:44.465
Why couldn't you
just see that?

36:44.500 --> 36:47.197
Why couldn't you
just leave her be?

36:47.230 --> 36:50.768
Now you have to live

37:11.960 --> 37:14.600
But I don't need the wolf
to end you, boy.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.367
(groaning)

37:26.140 --> 37:28.006
But I can't
go Now.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.680
You have to.

37:30.710 --> 37:34.544
I am not leaving
you like this.

37:34.580 --> 37:35.547
I'll be fine.

37:35.580 --> 37:36.843
You'll be
fine.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.087
Didn't you say if you
took someone else's door...

37:39.120 --> 37:40.212
No, Mom.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.252
You're not doing
that for me.

37:42.290 --> 37:43.655
Take it.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.055
Sure, Sally.

37:45.090 --> 37:46.182
Take it.

37:46.230 --> 37:47.425
Leave your mother
to go mad.

37:47.460 --> 37:48.621
That's so selfish.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.059
You just don't
want me to save them!

37:50.100 --> 37:51.158
They don't deserve
it!

Sally?

37:52.570 --> 37:53.765
You don't
understand.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.791
I don't know if you're
gonna get another one.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.160
You could go
crazy like me!

37:57.200 --> 38:01.000
So you'll help
me when you get back.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.652
I'll be okay.

But I can't leave
this up to chance.

You thought
you could win, huh?

39:17.650 --> 39:19.311
I made you, Josh,

39:19.350 --> 39:23.014
and your weakness is
my biggest disappointment!

Come on!

Let's do this
your way, huh?

39:51.520 --> 39:53.887
(Mother) The famished ache
you will soon come to feel

39:53.920 --> 39:57.788
is something very few
can understand,

39:57.820 --> 40:00.050
and the eternal
madness that results

40:00.090 --> 40:03.196
is a fate worse than
no other.

40:06.900 --> 40:10.996
I can think of
a worse fate.

40:11.040 --> 40:15.409
Living in eternity,

40:15.440 --> 40:19.047
knowing that you killed the only
one that ever loved you.

Close it.
