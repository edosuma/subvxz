01:07.360 --> 01:08.360
Now...

01:08.840 --> 01:12.400
that is an excellent magical staff!

01:12.480 --> 01:13.480
Thanks, Miss Mould.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.040
What's it for again?

01:15.440 --> 01:18.040
Well, wizards use them,
to focus their magic.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.480
I thought it might help
make your spells a little more... precise.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.680
- I wonder why no one suggested it before.
- Well, there are some who'll tell you...

01:26.760 --> 01:29.360
Staffs are for wizards only!

01:30.040 --> 01:33.680
They are considered un-witchlike.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.040
That, basically.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.840
But Miss Hardbroom,
if it helps with my magic, then...

01:38.920 --> 01:41.800
The Great Wizard does not allow it.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.520
Do you wish to discuss it with him?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.560
No, thank you.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.720
As I'm sure Miss Mould is aware,

01:57.160 --> 02:00.040
we have our own things,

02:01.120 --> 02:04.000
things which wizards are not allowed.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.440
Like what?

02:12.880 --> 02:15.480
<i>♪ Feathers of duck, tears of mole ♪</i>

02:15.560 --> 02:18.200
<i>♪ Burn them in a rabbit hole ♪</i>

02:18.280 --> 02:20.480
<i>♪ Dig them up, dance about ♪</i>

02:20.880 --> 02:23.640
<i>♪ Squashing flat a Brussels sprout ♪</i>

02:25.560 --> 02:28.680
Those are not the correct words,
and well you know it.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.720
Will you please
take your chanting more seriously?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.200
It's so unfair.

02:38.280 --> 02:42.320
Wizards get all the cool stuff.
Staffs, wands, wiz-ball.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.480
And what do we get? Boring old chanting.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.160
And girls, don't forget
our event this evening.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.360
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.680
The Extraordinary Esper Vespertilio.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.000
The who, Miss Bat?

03:01.560 --> 03:03.720
Esper Vespertilio.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.240
The most famous chantsmith of her day.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.160
Thank you, Ethel Hallow.
At least somebody's been paying attention.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.400
I'll be seeing you at the performance.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.200
Oh, I have to wash my broomstick,
Miss Bat.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.480
Madame Vespertilio has been persuaded

03:22.560 --> 03:24.920
to come out of retirement
for one night only

03:25.000 --> 03:28.280
to show you the beauty and power
of chanting.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.360
Now who is going to attend?

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
It's just...

03:35.360 --> 03:39.040
Um, I think it'd be nice
to do some more modern witching.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.440
Oh, well, if that's how you feel,
Mildred Hubble,

03:43.880 --> 03:47.240
you and your friends
can miss the rest of my lesson

03:48.040 --> 03:50.200
and put these up instead.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.200
I am sorry you have had to manage
without your cats,

03:54.280 --> 03:57.560
but perhaps now you'll think again
before misusing a wildfire spell,

03:57.640 --> 03:59.560
or any spell, for that matter.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.400
Thank you, Miss Cackle.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.640
Yours, I believe.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.400
Thank you, Miss Cackle.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.680
And yours, Beatrice.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.680
- Miss Cackle...
- Now I must get on.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.800
I need to check arrangements
for tonight's chanting performance.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.120
And I'm sure you're all itching
to get reacquainted.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.320
I thought she had that under control.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.400
The wizards wanna keep
all the good stuff for themselves.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.000
To stop the witches getting too powerful.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.280
If you feel that strongly,
why don't you tell the Great Wizard?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.560
Yeah, you can change
witching forever, Millie.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.120
I'm the worst witch here.
He's not gonna listen to me.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.400
Hey, careful.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.600
Is that my hat?

04:59.560 --> 05:00.960
Hey! Come back here!

05:04.440 --> 05:05.440
Uh...

05:27.600 --> 05:28.800
There!

05:40.800 --> 05:41.800
Got you.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.920
That's a boy.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.000
Thank you, Detective Maud.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.080
Who are you?

05:47.240 --> 05:49.960
Oliver. Ollie. I'm a wizard.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.240
We're taking you to Miss Cackle
before you steal anything else.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.120
Oh, no, please.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.560
We can do it the easy way

05:56.640 --> 05:59.600
or we can turn you into a mouse
and carry you by the tail.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.880
You got a kangaroo last time you tried.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.240
Yes, I know that, Maud.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.040
You can't tell the teachers.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.600
If I get caught,
I'll be finished as a wizard forever.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.120
<i>Sting of bee, egg of grouse,
turn this wizard into a...</i>

06:11.200 --> 06:13.120
I'm the Great Wizard's grandson!

06:18.400 --> 06:19.760
Beatrice?

06:20.760 --> 06:22.760
Beatrice, where are you?

06:24.240 --> 06:25.600
There!

06:27.400 --> 06:28.520
Now where?

06:30.920 --> 06:33.320
Beatrice, this cannot go on.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.440
You have to tell someone
about your asthma.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.480
I'm sure there are many simple treatments.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.520
It's not asthma.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.120
I'm allergic to cats.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.400
You don't know how hard it is
having him for a grandfather.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.800
So much pressure
to become a great wizard myself one day.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.200
That still doesn't explain
why you're sneaking around as a witch.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.960
Because it's my only chance.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.440
The type of magic I really love,
they don't teach at wizard school.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.920
And what type of magic is that?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Chanting.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.720
Chanting?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.760
And I think I'm actually quite good.
Or I could be.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.200
If I could take chanting lessons.
I've asked my grandfather again and again,

07:24.280 --> 07:27.040
but he says wizards don't chant,
that's just the way it is.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.200
That sounds just like HB.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.440
So, you came here to chant?

07:31.960 --> 07:33.320
I came to see her.

07:34.840 --> 07:35.840
Esper Vespertilio.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.800
I don't think we've got anything
to play that on.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.600
<i>♪ Cast of worm and spider hair ♪</i>

07:48.760 --> 07:53.280
<i>♪ Those who hold us back, beware ♪</i>

07:53.360 --> 07:57.320
<i>♪ Mix in rain from midnight skies... ♪</i>

07:58.440 --> 08:00.680
Okay, that was pretty crafty.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.120
A good soloist can take any chant
and make it their own.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.360
A great one like Madame Vespertilio

08:07.440 --> 08:09.480
can make even the oldest chant sound new.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.960
- You are such a fanboy.
- And so was my grandfather.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.000
I thought, if she could somehow
hear me chant,

08:16.080 --> 08:17.640
maybe she could talk to him.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.360
And then maybe
he'd let wizards take chanting lessons.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.600
We've had worse plans.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.880
Other academies have different familiars.
Why didn't you go to one of those?

08:29.960 --> 08:31.960
I've always dreamed of coming to Cackle's.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.799
And I'm not giving up on it
because of a silly allergy.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.039
- What is that?
- I brewed a vanishing potion.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.960
Do you have any idea how many rules
you're breaking even holding that?

08:44.039 --> 08:46.960
- What are you making vanish?
- My allergy, of course.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.200
You're aware how precise you have to be
when using a vanishing potion?

08:50.280 --> 08:53.520
<i>Potion, potion, now I spray,
make my sneezes go away!</i>

08:57.480 --> 08:58.600
Not even a tickle.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.400
I'm cured! I can stay! I'm cured!

09:03.120 --> 09:05.040
Where's Solstice?

09:05.440 --> 09:09.040
Oh, great. You made your cat vanish
instead of the allergy.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.120
Are you sure this is going to work?

09:16.200 --> 09:19.760
I said I'd get you backstage
to see Madame Vesper-thingy,

09:19.840 --> 09:20.840
and I will.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.640
Just try to look witchy.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.440
I've seen witchier bananas.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.080
We could all get
into terrible trouble for this, Millie.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.800
I know, but Ollie deserves a chance.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.440
And if everyone stuck to the rules,
I'd never have become a pupil here.

09:34.520 --> 09:38.000
And anyway, if Ollie can change
the Great Wizard's thinking on chanting,

09:38.080 --> 09:41.320
it could mean the end of wizards-only
and witches-only everything.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.000
If he's telling the truth.
Millie, we haven't even heard him chant.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.160
You think I'd put myself
through this unless...

09:47.560 --> 09:49.880
Hey, Mildred, who's your friend?

09:53.080 --> 09:56.440
Olive! Exchange student, from Pentangle's.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.640
- You're from Pentangle's?
- Yeah, I'm sure we told you.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.920
Hold on a minute.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.760
You're going nowhere

10:03.840 --> 10:07.200
until you tell me how you get
that amazing look for my new blog.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.000
- Um, I...
- Designer.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.960
You know, Pentangle girls.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.640
Has anybody seen Nightstar?
She was here a moment ago.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.440
- Who is this person?
- Exchange student, she says.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.160
Exchange? What exchange?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.800
- You remind me of someone.
- Well, must run.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.360
Can't be late for lessons
on her first day.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.160
But it's the end of school.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.520
No girls in classrooms after hours.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.080
- Yes, Miss Hardbroom.
- Yes, Miss Hardbroom.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.000
- Yes, Miss Hardbroom.
- Yes, Miss Hardbroom.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.800
There she is.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.920
- That is not a designer cloak.
- Go!

11:04.560 --> 11:07.720
Okay, okay, it's simple.
We can totally explain who that is.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.880
Maud?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.560
- We made it.
- Yeah.

11:17.640 --> 11:21.320
Esper should be right through... here!

11:22.720 --> 11:26.360
Miss Bat? We really need to speak
to Madame Vespertilio.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.920
- I'm afraid she won't be coming, Mildred.
- What?

11:30.400 --> 11:33.840
I've cancelled the show,
due to lack of interest.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.800
- Sparkle's gone!
- And Hazel.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.120
I think they're all gone.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.760
I passed a few girls
calling for their cats.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.680
Bea, what have you done?

11:51.760 --> 11:55.600
You could chant for Miss Bat.
Maybe she could speak to the Wizard.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.000
She's just a teacher.
Why would my grandfather listen to her?

12:01.360 --> 12:03.320
My last chance, gone.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.920
All because people don't understand
how amazing chanting can be.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.200
Where's that record?

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
Why do you...?

12:20.760 --> 12:23.720
Where do things go when they vanish?
They have to go somewhere.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.880
They go to Vanishment, of course.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.960
Where?

12:27.160 --> 12:30.640
I do so wonder
how you ever passed the entrance exam.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.600
Everything that gets magically vanished
goes to Vanishment.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
It's simple.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.800
So, if it's possible
to put something into Vanishment,

12:39.880 --> 12:41.880
it's possible to get it out again.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.360
Well, yes.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.240
All you need is a pair
of enchanted scissors, but...

12:49.640 --> 12:51.240
But it's dangerous!

12:51.600 --> 12:54.200
So many reports
of students losing their cats.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.040
- Don't you think that's...?
- Want to hear something amazing?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.520
Ugh, please.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.520
I'd rather listen to my sister
clanging a cauldron or...

13:02.600 --> 13:07.040
<i>♪ Cast of worm and spider hair ♪</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:11.440
<i>♪ Those who hold us back beware ♪</i>

13:11.720 --> 13:15.960
<i>♪ Mix in rain from midnight skies ♪</i>

13:16.200 --> 13:18.560
<i>♪ Witches now shall rise ♪</i>

13:18.640 --> 13:22.280
Not only that, but she was cool too.
She broke all the rules.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.440
- Chanting is awesome.
- Mildred Hubble!

13:26.880 --> 13:30.560
Where is Mildred Hubble
and her new friend?

13:41.040 --> 13:44.280
You'll soon have your cats back.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.680
Solstice.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.400
Uh... uh...

14:10.280 --> 14:11.440
Beatrice.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.680
Beatrice, don't.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.200
Relax, I've fixed it. Look.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.760
Sparkle.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.920
Hazel.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.080
I don't think you fully understand.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.400
Give me some credit...

14:31.320 --> 14:32.720
Give me some credit.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.560
You're not the only one
who can do magic around here.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.280
Ugh! What...?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.160
- What's happening?
- I told you!

14:43.720 --> 14:46.720
Everything that gets disappeared
goes into Vanishment.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.880
And you just pulled out the stopper.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.160
Pocus!

15:04.240 --> 15:06.480
Nightstar, there you are.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.920
Marvellous turnout. How exciting!

15:18.000 --> 15:21.440
It shows that young witches
still enjoy the old traditions.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.040
Well, even the most traditional traditions
were new once, Miss Hardbroom, no?

15:25.120 --> 15:29.200
I think that might be
from an Esper Vespertilio chant, actually.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.640
I wouldn't know.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.880
Oh, she's wonderful. Huge fan.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.840
She taught me so much

15:35.920 --> 15:39.000
about not blindly following
those in charge.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.960
- Millie, how did you?
- You sold a chanting performance.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.760
Looks like it's going to be
a wonderful show, dear.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
Yes, it does.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.960
Miss Bat. Everybody wants to see
Madame Vespertilio.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.920
Please send a broomstick,
do a transportation spell,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
whatever it takes.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.600
- I can't.
- But why?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.680
Because she's already here.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.000
Thank you all for coming.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.960
<i>♪ Tail of ox and beard of goat ♪</i>

16:50.320 --> 16:54.160

16:58.640 --> 17:03.560
<i>♪ And then the bats shall dance for you ♪</i>

17:05.480 --> 17:06.480
Wow.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.319
I don't...

17:13.119 --> 17:16.160
"Vespertilio," Mildred Hubble...

17:16.839 --> 17:20.480
- Latin for "bat."
- Wow!

17:20.560 --> 17:22.640
Wow!

17:22.720 --> 17:27.200
That was her stage name.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.200
Don't tell me you didn't know.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.240
There must be a way
to close the hole.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.160
Yes, there is. But I don't know it.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.080
Push, you two, push!

17:52.880 --> 17:57.200
<i>♪ Scatter petals

17:57.280 --> 18:01.560
<i>♪ Bring our dance now to a close ♪</i>

18:11.000 --> 18:12.840
- Now's your chance.
- What?

18:12.920 --> 18:13.920
You're on!

18:14.800 --> 18:16.640
For my next chant...

18:17.000 --> 18:19.560
Miss Vespertilio! Excuse me, but...

18:21.560 --> 18:23.400
As promised, front row.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.560
- Nothing's too good for the Great Wizard.
- I hope we haven't missed too much.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.400
If you don't come out,
I'm giving this to the school jumble sale.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.240
My grandfather's on the front row.
He's sure to recognize me.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.760
So you just give up?

18:42.160 --> 18:43.600
Nothing is ever going to change

18:43.680 --> 18:46.240
unless you stand up
and do something about it.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.520
Isn't that what Esper did?

18:47.840 --> 18:49.560
Yes, Mildred. It was.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.120
And I wonder
if it's what you're going to do, too.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.680
Or are you just going
to accept things as they are?

18:57.120 --> 19:01.080
After all, wizards
get so much "cool stuff," don't they?

19:02.120 --> 19:04.280
Staffs, wands, wiz-ball.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.000
And what do we get?

19:06.560 --> 19:07.880
Madame Vespertilio,

19:08.320 --> 19:11.800
I've come a long way to...
To perform for you, so...

19:11.880 --> 19:15.720
Your audience is out <i>there, </i> young man.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.520
You know?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
Are we going to hear you or not?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.000
- Push!
- We are pushing!

19:24.400 --> 19:26.560
Oh, it's going to blow!
It's going to blow!

19:30.480 --> 19:33.040
Yes, I was a great admirer of Vespertilio.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.200
I have all her albums, every one.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.960
Oh, you'll be familiar

19:37.040 --> 19:40.680
with the rare
<i>Live at Pendle Hill</i> album, then?

19:40.760 --> 19:43.160
Yes, of course.
Yes. Yes, one of my favourites.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.480
Funny. I just made that one up.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.480
Oh, good. It's starting again.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.880
<i>♪ Acorn husk and coal... ♪</i>

20:04.080 --> 20:05.240
♪ Mmm... ♪

20:05.640 --> 20:08.840

20:08.920 --> 20:11.880

20:12.440 --> 20:15.840

20:16.200 --> 20:20.080

20:45.040 --> 20:47.120
You'll make
a very good chantsmith one day.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.200
I hope she's having extra lessons, Ada.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.280
I'm a...

20:50.840 --> 20:53.880
I'm afraid I don't know who that is,
Your Greatness.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
Nor I.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.840
But she has something to do
with Mildred Hubble.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.520
Mildred Hubble...?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.040
Excuse me.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.960
Who are you?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.160
What is this?

21:17.520 --> 21:18.640
Is this a joke?

21:18.920 --> 21:21.880
No, Grandfather. I just want a chance.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.400
I thought maybe Esper could make you see...

21:24.720 --> 21:28.720
What I see is a wizard
shaming the family name!

21:29.520 --> 21:32.520
How dare a grandson of mine
challenge my authority?

21:32.600 --> 21:34.520
Wizards do not chant!

21:34.600 --> 21:35.680
Please.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.920
That is the way it has
always been, the way it always will be!

21:40.000 --> 21:42.440
Now get out of that ridiculous costume.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.400
Um, excuse me, Your Greatness,

21:45.480 --> 21:48.400
but I do think that,
if you don't mind me saying,

21:48.480 --> 21:51.920
that is the most old-fashioned
and unfair rule I ever heard.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.240
No one should be stopped
from doing what they love

21:54.320 --> 21:57.080
purely because they are a wizard
or a witch.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.480
Why shouldn't a wizard be great
at chanting?

21:59.560 --> 22:02.080
Why shouldn't a witch be great
at wizard ball?

22:02.160 --> 22:05.320
It makes no sense, Your Greatness.
No sense at all.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.640
Surely it's time that it changed.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.280
She's right.

22:14.280 --> 22:15.960
Nothing is going to change.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.080
A wizard chanting.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.440
It would be like...

22:25.080 --> 22:26.520
a witch with a staff.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.000
Oh!

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Pity.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.640
You know, young man, it's funny...

23:10.960 --> 23:15.800
the times we've met and you never
seemed to realize who I was.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.120
I've always remembered <i>you.</i>

23:22.440 --> 23:25.080
I signed it for you. Don't you remember?

23:30.760 --> 23:31.760
I remember.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.520
I remember telling you, you made me want...

23:36.960 --> 23:39.320
You made me want to change
the world with magic.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.760
Well, Oliver, it seems that magic
has to be dragged into the modern world.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.240
If Esper... Miss Bat, agrees, then...

23:53.160 --> 23:56.200
- you can come here for night classes.
- Yes!

24:00.560 --> 24:01.560
As for you,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.160
Mildred Hubble...

24:05.200 --> 24:09.280
Miss Cackle, it's all my fault. I opened
a Vanishment hole and I can't close it.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.360
It is a good staff.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.440
Use it wisely.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.400
- You were brilliant, Ollie.
- And so were you, Millie!

24:50.480 --> 24:53.200
Esper Vespertilio, thank you.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.280
- Thank you, Mildred Hubble.
- You're welcome.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.400
Oliver, home.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.360
Thought he'd never leave.

25:02.480 --> 25:06.200
How exactly
did this Vanishment hole open, girls?

25:06.720 --> 25:09.280
Well, it's a long story, and...

25:09.360 --> 25:10.960
She's allergic to cats.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.840
Well, there's only one solution to that.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.280
Miss Hardbroom,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.600
would you escort Beatrice to my office?

25:23.560 --> 25:26.240
You know what can not
be put into Vanishment?

25:26.880 --> 25:28.160
Detention.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.840
And you can join them, Mildred Hubble.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.720
What I can't understand
is why you didn't tell me sooner.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.040
We could have done something about it
before you caused all this trouble.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.160
I'm sorry.
I just really wanted to stay here.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.520
Mmm.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.600
Well, if you can't have a cat,
how is that possible?

26:00.480 --> 26:02.880
- I don't know, Miss Cackle.
- Hmm.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.840
I think there are a few drops left here.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.680
You have to be very precise
when using a vanishing potion.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.560
Now.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.880
But Miss Cackle, I... I...

26:32.480 --> 26:33.600
No sneezes.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.640
Not even a tickle. Am I really cured?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.200
Of course you're cured.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.720
In future, if you have a problem
which you can't solve,

26:41.800 --> 26:45.240
the only way to make it vanish
is ask for help.

27:03.680 --> 27:04.680
Miss Hardbroom?

27:10.440 --> 27:12.680
I'm here for detention.

27:12.760 --> 27:13.760
Fine.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.360
Is something the matter?

27:17.680 --> 27:19.320
Nothing, Miss Hardbroom.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.080
Nothing at all.
