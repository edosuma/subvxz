00:02.461 --> 00:03.796
MARY:
Sammy.

00:04.046 --> 00:07.216
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Now, Dean. Go!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.387
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.222
He hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.102
-I swore I was done hunting.
-I can't do this alone.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.646
No! Jess!

00:20.813 --> 00:23.065
I think Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.192
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.820
No. I gotta find Jessica's killer.

(WOMAN WHIMPERING)

00:47.381 --> 00:49.258
MAN 1 (ON WALKIE-TALKIE):
Roger that.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.181
(BLAST)

01:29.048 --> 01:31.175
MAN 1:
Be advised, we found the victim.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.346
She's alive.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.100
It's okay. It's okay.

01:41.519 --> 01:46.023
WOMAN:
In there. There. In there.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.234
MAN 1:
Choke Team, let's go.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.867
-Freeze! Don't move!
MAN 2: Drop the knife.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.203
-Keep your hands where I see them!
MAN 1: Drop it.

01:59.286 --> 02:03.123
-Hold it right there! Come on, come on!
MAN 2: Now.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.750
MAN 3:
Nice and easy.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.169
MAN 1:
Do it.

02:26.939 --> 02:31.569
All right. I figure we hit Tucumcari
by lunch, then head south...

02:31.777 --> 02:34.196
...then Bisbee by midnight.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.782
Sam wears women's underwear.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.035
-I've been listening, I'm just busy.
-Busy doing what?

02:40.119 --> 02:42.079
Reading e-mails.

02:43.581 --> 02:46.125
-E-mails from who?
-From my friends at Stanford.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.712
You're kidding. You still keep in touch
with your college buddies?

02:50.045 --> 02:53.007
-Why not?
-Well...

02:56.051 --> 02:57.720
...what exactly do you tell them?

02:57.928 --> 03:00.848
You know? About where you've been,
what you've been doing.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.309
I tell them I'm on a road trip
with my big brother.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.228
I tell them I needed
some time off after Jess.

03:06.312 --> 03:11.191
-Oh, so you lie to them.
-No. I just don't tell them everything.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.111
Yeah, that's called lying.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.780
I get it. Telling them the truth
is far worse.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.992
So, what am I supposed to do?
Just cut everybody out of my life?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.245
-You're serious?
-Look, it sucks, but...

03:23.412 --> 03:25.998
...a job like this, you can't
get close to people.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
You're kind of antisocial,
you know that?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.710
Yeah, whatever.

03:31.629 --> 03:33.297
Unbelievable.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.008
-God.
-What?

03:37.009 --> 03:40.596
This e-mail from this girl Rebecca
Warren, one of those friends of mine.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.097
She hot?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.808
I went to school with her
and her brother Zach.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.227
She says Zach's been
charged with murder.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.355
Arrested for killing his girlfriend.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.231
Rebecca says he didn't do it...

03:51.440 --> 03:55.194
...but it sounds like the cops
have a pretty good case.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.571
Dude, what kind of people
you hanging out with?

03:57.655 --> 03:59.198
No, I know Zach. He's no killer.

03:59.448 --> 04:02.618
Yeah, well, maybe you know Zach
as well as he knows you.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.454
They're in St. Louis. We're going.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.581
Look, sorry about your buddy, okay?

04:07.790 --> 04:09.959
This does not sound like
our kind of problem.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.710
It is. They're my friends.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.047
St. Louis is 400 miles
behind us, Sam.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.857
-Oh, my God. Sam.
-Well, if it isn't little Becky.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.819
And you know what you can do
with that "little Becky" crap.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.449
-I got your e-mail.
-I didn't think that you would come.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.327
Dean. Older brother.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.246
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.332
We're here to help.
Whatever we can do.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.042
Come in.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.841
DEAN: Nice place.
BECKY: It's my parents'.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.219
I was crashing here for the long
weekend when everything happened.

05:02.428 --> 05:06.932
I decided to take the semester off.
I'm gonna stay until Zach's free.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.102
-Where are your folks?
-They live in Paris for half the year...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.646
...so they're on their way
home now for the trial.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.148
You guys want a beer?

05:14.356 --> 05:15.524
-Hey.
-No thanks.

05:16.692 --> 05:20.404
So tell us what happened.

05:20.487 --> 05:25.617
Well.... Zach, he came home,
and he found Emily tied to a chair.

05:26.076 --> 05:30.956
And she was beaten up and bloody,
and she wasn't breathing, and so he--

05:31.206 --> 05:35.169
He called 911 and the police,
they showed up and--

05:35.377 --> 05:36.462
And they arrested him.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.758
But the thing is, the only way
that Zach could have killed Emily...

05:40.966 --> 05:43.343
...is if he was in two places
at the same time.

05:44.261 --> 05:48.891
The police, they have a video. It's from
the security tape from across the street.

05:49.058 --> 05:53.479
And it shows Zach
coming home at 10:30.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.939
Now, Emily was killed just after that.

05:56.231 --> 06:01.028
But I swear, he was here with me having
a few beers until at least after midnight.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.697
You know, maybe we could
see the crime scene.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.657
-Zach's house.
-We could.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.119
I mean, why?
I mean, what could you do?

06:09.369 --> 06:12.331
Well, me, not much. But Dean's a cop.

06:13.499 --> 06:14.583
(CHUCKLES)

06:16.293 --> 06:20.172
-A detective, actually.
-Really? Where?

06:20.339 --> 06:22.424
Bisbee, Arizona.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.677
But I'm off duty now.

06:27.638 --> 06:31.433
You guys, it's so nice to offer,
but I just-- I don't know.

06:31.642 --> 06:35.479
Beck, look, I know Zach didn't do this.

06:35.729 --> 06:40.317
Now, we have to find a way
to prove that he's innocent.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.654
Okay.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.490
I'm gonna go get the keys.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.329
(DEAN WHISTLES)

06:52.538 --> 06:55.082
You're a real straight shooter
with your friends.

06:55.457 --> 06:59.419
-Look, Zach and Becky need our help.
-I don't think this is our kind of problem.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.714
Two places at once?
We've looked into less.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.111
You're sure this is okay?

07:24.319 --> 07:27.322
Yeah. I am an officer of the law.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.675
Beck, you wanna wait outside?

07:48.427 --> 07:50.804
No, I wanna help.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.355
Tell us what else the police said.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.234
Well, there's no sign of a break-in.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.820
They say that Emily let her attacker in.

08:07.029 --> 08:10.699
The lawyers, they're already
talking about plea-bargain.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.703
Oh, God.

08:16.163 --> 08:21.919
Look, Beck, if Zach didn't do this,
it means someone else did.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.670
Any idea who?

08:28.091 --> 08:32.804
There was something. About a week
before, somebody broke in here.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.600
They stole some clothes. Zach's clothes.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.561
The police,
they don't think it's anything.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.564
I mean, we're not that far
from downtown.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.776
Sometimes people get robbed.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.697
(DOG BARKING)

08:53.784 --> 08:56.036
You know, that used to be
the sweetest dog.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.413
DEAN: What happened?
BECKY: He just changed.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.666
DEAN:
Do you remember when he changed?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.210
I guess around the time of the murder.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.181
So the neighbor's dog went psycho...

09:16.390 --> 09:19.017
...right around the time
Zach's girlfriend was killed.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.395
Animals can sense the paranormal.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.605
Yeah, maybe Fido saw something.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.943
So you think maybe
this is our kind of problem?

09:28.151 --> 09:32.197
No, probably not. But we should look at
the security tape just to make sure.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.449
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.787
So the tape, the security footage?

09:38.954 --> 09:42.249
Think your lawyers could get it?
I don't have that jurisdiction.

09:42.457 --> 09:46.086
I've already got it. I didn't wanna say
something in front of the cop.

09:46.295 --> 09:51.842
I stole it off the lawyer's desk.
I just had to see it for myself.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.428
All right.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.573
LINDSAY:
I'm gonna miss you.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.660
-Why do they always have to send you?
-Because I'm the best.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.872
Well, I know. That's why
I want you to stay home.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.790
It's just Kansas City.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.296
Be home tomorrow night
and make it up to you.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.760
LINDSAY:
You'd better.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.702
Here he comes.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.247
2204, that's just after 10.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.000
You said time of death
was about 10:30.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.753
Our lawyers hired
some kind of video expert.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.880
He says the tape's authentic.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.757
It wasn't tampered with.

11:17.928 --> 11:22.849
-Beck, can we take those beers now?
-Oh, sure.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.895
Hey.... Maybe some sandwiches too?

11:27.104 --> 11:30.065
What do you think this is, Hooters?

11:31.233 --> 11:35.070
-I wish. What is it?
-Check this out.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.665
DEAN: Maybe it's just a camera flare.
-That's not like any flare I've ever seen.

11:46.915 --> 11:50.085
A lot of cultures believe a photo
can catch a glimpse of the soul.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.796
-Right.
-Remember that dog? Maybe he saw this.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.883
Maybe this is a dark double of Zach's,
something that looks like him but isn't.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.468
-Like a doppelgänger.
SAM: Yeah.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.638
That would sure explain how
he was in two places at once.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.691
Honey? It's me.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.612
The client cancelled at the last minute.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.659
I called. Why didn't you answer?

12:26.872 --> 12:28.832
Lindsay?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.794
Lindsay?

12:35.630 --> 12:37.257
Lindsay?

12:42.804 --> 12:44.598
It's okay, Lindsay. It's me.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.766
Please don't hurt me anymore.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.977
Leave me alone.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.874
All right. So, what are we doing
here at 5:30 in the morning?

13:53.083 --> 13:54.209
I realized something.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.796
The videotape shows the killer
going in, but not coming out.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.590
-So he came out the back door?
SAM: Right.

14:00.799 --> 14:04.678
So there should be a trail to follow.
A trail the police would never pursue.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.557
DEAN: Because they think the killer never
left. They caught your friend Zach inside.

14:08.807 --> 14:12.018
I still don't know what we're
doing here at 5:30 in the morning.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.702
Blood. Somebody came this way.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.329
Maybe the trail ends.
I don't see anything here.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.790
(SIRENS WAILING)

14:49.889 --> 14:52.892
-What happened?
-He tried to kill his wife.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.062
-Tied her up and beat her.
-Really?

14:56.146 --> 14:59.566
I used to see him going to work
in the morning. He'd wave, say hello.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.901
He seemed like such a nice guy.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.137
Hey. Remember when I said...

15:29.346 --> 15:31.306
-...this wasn't our kind of problem?
-Yeah.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.767
-Definitely our kind of problem.
-What did you find out?

15:33.850 --> 15:37.270
I just talked to the patrolman
who heard this guy Alex's story.

15:37.354 --> 15:40.565
The dude was driving home from a trip
when his wife was attacked.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.609
-So he was two places at once?
-Exactly.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.654
Then he sees himself in the house.
Cops say he's a nut job.

15:45.737 --> 15:50.533
Two dark doubles attacking
loved ones in exactly the same way.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.619
Could be the same thing doing it too.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.540
Shapeshifter? Something that
can make itself look like anyone?

15:57.749 --> 15:59.751
Every culture has a shapeshifter lore.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.380
Legends of creatures who transform
themselves into animals or other men.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.006
Right. Skinwalkers, werewolves.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.509
We got two attacks
within blocks of each other.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.928
I'm guessing we got
a shapeshifter problem.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.388
Let me ask you this:

16:11.554 --> 16:15.892
In all this shapeshifter lore,
can any of them fly?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.937
-Not that I know of.
SAM: I picked up a trail here.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.315
Someone ran out of the back of this
building, headed off this way.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.902
-Just like your friend's house.
-Yeah. And just like at Zach's house...

16:26.111 --> 16:27.737
...the trail suddenly ends.

16:28.279 --> 16:32.367
I mean, whatever it is just disappeared.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.954
Well, there's another way to go.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.997
Down.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.395
I bet this runs right by Zach's house too.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.982
The shapeshifter could be using
the sewer system to get around.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.317
DEAN:
I think you're right.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.778
Look at this.

17:14.826 --> 17:18.121

Is this from his victims?

17:23.334 --> 17:24.794
DEAN:
I just had a sick thought.

17:25.003 --> 17:30.508
When the shapeshifter
changes shape, maybe it sheds.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.094
That is sick.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.765
One thing I learned from Dad:

17:37.015 --> 17:40.810
No matter what kind of shapeshifter
it is, there's one sure way to kill it.

17:41.436 --> 17:44.689
-Silver bullet to the heart.
-That's right.

Sam, just stop, because I really...

17:53.281 --> 17:55.492
-...don't need your help anymore.
-What?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.912
I told the lawyers that
we went to the crime scene.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.998
-Why would you do that?
-I said we were with a policeman...

18:02.081 --> 18:05.835
...and they checked it out and said
there is no Detective Dean Winchester.

18:05.919 --> 18:09.547
-Beck--
-I don't get why you would lie to me.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.925
-We're trying to help.
-Oh, trying to help?

18:12.133 --> 18:14.344
Do you realize that was
a sealed crime scene?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.347
-This could have ruined Zach's case.
-I'm sorry, but--

18:17.555 --> 18:19.224
No. Goodbye, Sam.

18:32.028 --> 18:35.114
I hate to say it, but that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.494
You lie to your friends because if they
knew the real you, they'd be freaked.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.289
-It's just-- It'd be easier if--
-If I was like you.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.917
Hey, like it or not,
we are not like other people.

18:47.585 --> 18:50.588
But I'll tell you one thing,
this whole gig...

18:52.215 --> 18:53.842
...it ain't without perks.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.150
DEAN: Think we're close to its lair.
-Why do you say that?

19:52.734 --> 19:55.528
Because there's another
puke-inducing pile next to your face.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.946
Oh, God.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.367
DEAN: Looks like it's lived
here for a while.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.746
Who knows how many murders
he's gotten away with.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.540
Dean!

20:12.754 --> 20:15.214
Get the son of a bitch!

20:44.994 --> 20:48.998
-All right, let's split up.
-All right. I'll meet you on the other side.

20:51.793 --> 20:52.835
(CHATTERING)

21:02.720 --> 21:05.181
-Yes.
-Oh, I know.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.787
DEAN:
Hey.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.750
-Anything?
-No, he's gone.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.336
All right, let's get back to the car.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.215
(HORN HONKING)

21:51.436 --> 21:53.938
SAM: You think he found
another way underground?

21:54.105 --> 21:57.442
Yeah, probably. You got the keys?

22:00.528 --> 22:04.615
Hey, didn't Dad once face a
shapeshifter in San Antonio?

22:05.408 --> 22:06.451
No, it was Austin.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.912
And it turned out not to be a
shapeshifter. It was a thought-form.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.789
A psychic projection, remember?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.585
Oh, right.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.628
Here you go.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.522
Don't move!
What have you done with him?

22:36.814 --> 22:38.274
Dude, chill.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.276
-It's me, all right?
-I don't think so.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.862
-Where's my brother?
-You're about to shoot him.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.531
-Calm down.
-You caught those keys with your left.

22:45.615 --> 22:48.701
-Your shoulder was hurt.
-Yeah, it's better. You want me to cry?

22:48.951 --> 22:50.620
You're not my brother.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.541
Why don't you pull the trigger, then.
Because you're not sure.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.085
Dude, you know me.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.462
Don't.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.623
Where is he?

23:36.040 --> 23:38.459
Where's Dean?

23:39.627 --> 23:42.421
SHAPESHIFTER:
I wouldn't worry about him.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.633
-I'd worry about you.
-Where is he?

23:46.801 --> 23:48.219
You don't really wanna know.

23:51.055 --> 23:53.558
I swear, the more I learn
about your family....

23:55.226 --> 23:57.478
I thought I came from
a bad background.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.188
What do you mean, learn?

(SHAPESHIFTER GRUNTS)

24:21.752 --> 24:23.087
He sure got issues with you.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.716
You got to go to college.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.468
He had to stay home.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.930
I mean, I had to stay home.
With Dad.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.266
You don't think I had
dreams of my own?

24:35.516 --> 24:37.476
But Dad needed me.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.562
-Where the hell were you?
-Where...

24:39.729 --> 24:42.565
-...is my brother?
-I'm your brother.

24:43.941 --> 24:48.529
See, deep down, I'm just jealous.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.949
You got friends. You could have a life.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.329
Me? I know I'm a freak.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.582
And sooner or later,
everybody's gonna leave me.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.295
-What are you talking about?
-You left.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.715
Hell, I did everything Dad asked me to,
and he ditched me too.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.092
No explanation, nothing. Just:

25:12.845 --> 25:14.263
Left me with your sorry ass.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.104
But still, this life...

25:22.188 --> 25:25.066
...it's not without its perks.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.778
I meet the nicest people.

25:29.028 --> 25:33.658
Like little Becky. You know Dean
would bang her if he had the chance.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.744
Let's see what happens.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.080
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

25:47.797 --> 25:50.258
-Oh, hi.
-I know what you're gonna say.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.593
-Oh, you do?
-Well, no, not exactly.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.846
But I can take a guess:
"Get off my porch"?

25:57.598 --> 25:58.849
That's about right.

25:59.934 --> 26:03.062
I admit it, we lied.
Thought I'd try to explain myself.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.898
Sam told me not to come,
but I thought:

26:05.982 --> 26:08.317
"What the hell? I have to try."

26:14.323 --> 26:15.992
Damn it.

(DEAN COUGHING)

26:19.537 --> 26:22.123
That better be you, Sam,
and not that freak of nature.

26:24.166 --> 26:28.129
Yeah, it's me. He went to Rebecca's,
looking like you.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.091
Well, he's not stupid.
He picked the handsome one.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.349
So you're saying
that there's something...

26:40.558 --> 26:43.269
...out there that made itself
look like my brother.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.979
Mm-hmm.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.189
-What did you call it?
-A shapeshifter.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.777
Yeah. Maybe we're crazy.

26:52.028 --> 26:52.987
But what if we're not?

26:54.071 --> 26:57.241
Look, you said it yourself that
Zach was in two places at once.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.745
-Tell me how that could happen.
-Okay, so this thing...

27:00.953 --> 27:03.998
...it can make itself look like anybody?

27:04.165 --> 27:05.708
That's right.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.336
Well, what is it? Like a genetic freak?

27:09.045 --> 27:10.463
(CHUCKLES)

27:11.339 --> 27:13.090
Maybe.

27:14.884 --> 27:18.721
Evolution is about mutation, right?

27:19.096 --> 27:22.433
So maybe this thing was born human...

27:22.767 --> 27:24.560
...but was different.

27:25.102 --> 27:28.314
Hideous and hated.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.068
Until he learned to
become someone else.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.199
SAM:
Yeah, that's the thing.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.202
He didn't just look like you,
he was you...

27:41.410 --> 27:43.871
-...or he was becoming you.
-What do you mean?

27:44.080 --> 27:47.083
It's like he was downloading
your thoughts and memories.

27:48.042 --> 27:51.003
-You mean like the Vulcan Mind Meld?
-Yes, something like that.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.547
Maybe that's why
he doesn't just kill us.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.137
Maybe he needs to keep us alive...

28:00.429 --> 28:03.265
-...for the psychic connection.
-Hands.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.645
Yeah. Come on, we gotta go.
He's probably at Rebecca's already.

call the police.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.295
Close to no one.

no silver bullets.

39:13.477 --> 39:17.314
Well, you know, Zach and me and
everybody at school, we really miss you.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.193
Yeah, me too.

39:24.237 --> 39:27.616
Well, will you call sometime?

39:28.158 --> 39:30.702
It might not be for a little while.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.386
DEAN:
So, what about your friend Zach?

39:48.595 --> 39:52.933
Cops are blaming this Dean Winchester
guy for Emily's murder.

39:53.016 --> 39:55.435
They found the murder weapon
in the guy's lair...

39:55.560 --> 39:57.896
...Zach's clothes
stained with her blood.

39:58.105 --> 40:01.358
Now they're thinking maybe the
surveillance tape was tampered with.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.985
Yeah, Becca says Zach will be
released soon.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.998
Sorry, man.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.043
About what?

40:21.002 --> 40:24.798
I really wish things could be different.
I wish you could just be...

40:24.965 --> 40:27.717
-...Joe College.
-It's okay.

40:27.884 --> 40:31.930
You know, truth is, even at Stanford,
deep down, I never really fit in.

40:32.013 --> 40:34.808
-Well, that's because you're a freak.
-Yeah, thanks.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.685
Well, I'm a freak too.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.312
I'm right there with you all the way.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.566
Yeah, I know you are.

40:43.567 --> 40:46.903
You know, I gotta say,
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.

40:47.154 --> 40:48.905
Miss what?

40:48.989 --> 40:52.242
How many chances am I gonna have
to see my own funeral?
