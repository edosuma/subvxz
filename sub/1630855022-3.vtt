WEBVTT

00:34.159 --> 00:35.160
Hello?

00:37.913 --> 00:38.997
Is someone in here?

00:40.874 --> 00:44.628
I have bat... and a Taser,

00:45.254 --> 00:48.090
and I know Krav Maga, so...

01:11.071 --> 01:12.197
What the hell?

01:18.537 --> 01:19.371
Okay.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.022
Yes. Jesus.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.537
Yeah, okay.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.464
Jacob, what the hell is this?

02:10.964 --> 02:14.009
I don't know.
It's like a video game or something.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.636
Where did it come from?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.221
I don't know. You don't know?

02:17.221 --> 02:19.890
What do you mean you don't know?
Weren't you here, stocking shelves?

02:19.890 --> 02:22.976
Yeah, definitely.
I just had my headphones on, but--

02:22.976 --> 02:24.728
You were here the whole time?

02:24.728 --> 02:25.812
Yeah.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.773
So, it just appeared like magic?

02:27.773 --> 02:28.857
Yeah.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.444
"Discover your life potential."

02:33.862 --> 02:36.156
You think people might actually
use this thing?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.327
Yeah.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.515
Yeah, apparently,
Principal Pat had been there for an hour.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.226
Yeah. She could've died
if Jacob hadn't found her.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.354
Hey-oh, the hero's here! I gotta go.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.691
- Hey.
- Okay. All right.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.860
Shouldn't you be at work?

03:12.860 --> 03:16.363
I don't know. Should people
who quit their jobs be at work?

03:17.072 --> 03:20.242
- What?
- Yeah, man. You inspired me.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.411
You're running around
saving people's lives,

03:22.411 --> 03:26.081
and here I am, driving a Zamboni
in circles for a shit wage.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.084
I'm not saving people's lives.
I dialed 911.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.545
At most, I should be praised
for knowing how to use a phone.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.547
Hey, Jake, check it out.

03:34.131 --> 03:39.887
I made you... a face.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.056
Just like your mom used to.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.685
Except we didn't have onions,
so I used celery.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.479
And the eggs are past the sell-by date,
but they smell fine.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.442
- You don't have to eat 'em--
- Okay.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.281
All right, what's going on, Dad?

03:59.281 --> 04:02.743
Why are you making breakfast
and conversation with me?

04:02.743 --> 04:05.537
- Why are you calling me "Jake"?
- Because, Jacob.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.248
Look, I know

04:09.333 --> 04:12.669
that you and I aren't... super tight.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.214
And I know that you've had to pick up
a lot of slack around here

04:16.214 --> 04:19.885
for a long time,
but I'm gonna step up my game now.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.928
I don't really think I need that.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.389
I should get to school.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.934
- Cool. But hey, Sport--
- No.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.520
With this whole Principal Pat thing,

04:30.270 --> 04:31.688
I just wanted to say...

04:34.691 --> 04:35.734
awesome.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.698
All right.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.457
Yeah!

05:00.425 --> 05:02.845
Dude, why'd you save the principal?
Fricking nerd!

05:04.221 --> 05:07.057
I'm just kidding, man. I'm just kidding.
I fricking adore you.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.269
All right, everybody just--

05:10.269 --> 05:12.312
Let's give Jacob a chance to settle in.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.441
I'm sure that we all know by now
what was written on Jacob's card.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.360
And I know that a lot of you
are very excited,

05:18.360 --> 05:21.154
because it seems like
he's fulfilled his "potential."

05:22.155 --> 05:23.866
But this is a history class.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.869
I happen to think that we can learn
things from history.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.038
Let's talk about what would happen

05:30.038 --> 05:34.376
if the MORPHO machine existed
at some key historical moments.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.171
Okay, Rita. You are Abraham Lincoln,

05:37.171 --> 05:41.383
and you're about to start your
law practice in Springfield, Illinois.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.343
- Okay.
- Or are you?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.345
Because I am the MORPHO machine,

05:45.345 --> 05:51.518
and I have given you a card that tells you
your potential is actually to be...

05:53.687 --> 05:56.148
- "Candy maker."
- So now the question is, Mr. Lincoln,

05:56.148 --> 06:00.694
do you pursue a career
making sour worms and lollipops,

06:00.694 --> 06:05.115
or do you continue your trajectory
of setting up a law practice

06:05.115 --> 06:08.160
and becoming the most influential
president in American history?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.953
I guess I become a lawyer?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.622
Of course you do.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.665
He'd still be alive though.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.709
- What?
- Lincoln.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.253
No one would've assassinated him
for being a candy maker.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.797
America would've missed out on
a pretty great president, don't you think?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.300
Isn't it true that in his Peoria speech,
it was Lincoln's position

06:23.300 --> 06:26.094
to force slaves to leave America
if and when they were freed?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.346
Uh-huh.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.432
You know, strictly speaking,
this is a European history class, Rita,

06:30.432 --> 06:32.935
so let's just try
and stay on that lesson plan.

06:32.935 --> 06:37.147
Savannah. Would Henry I
have signed the Treaty of Alton

06:37.147 --> 06:40.484
if the MORPHO machine had told him
that he was supposed to be a--

06:40.484 --> 06:41.568
I don't know, a janitor?

06:41.568 --> 06:44.947
We never got to the Treaty of Alton.
You keep doing lectures about the MORPHO.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.698
I bring it up
because I see a lot of people

06:46.698 --> 06:50.160
diving into whatever
a machine tells them to do,

06:50.160 --> 06:51.995
instead of really thinking
about the consequences.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.372
Didn't you get "Teacher"?

06:54.039 --> 06:56.875
And aren't you... teaching right now?

06:56.875 --> 06:57.793
Yeah.

06:57.793 --> 06:58.877
I'm trying to.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.504
Okay.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.007
Let's-- I've got a surprise for you guys.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.133
We gonna watch another movie?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.302
No, we are not watching another movie.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.973
I'm gonna make a little call
to someone you know

07:11.765 --> 07:13.851
who will have some interesting thoughts
on the MORPHO machine,

07:13.851 --> 07:15.185
I would've thought.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.064
Okay. I probably should've dialed her in
before announcing it, but--

07:19.064 --> 07:20.190
No, hold it. Hey--

07:20.190 --> 07:22.985
Hello, Principal Pat! How are you feeling?

07:22.985 --> 07:23.944
<i>Better than I look,</i>

07:23.944 --> 07:25.654
<i>which isn't saying much, I know.</i>

07:25.654 --> 07:28.031
You look fine.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.534
Listen, I'm so sorry
to hear about your accident,

07:30.534 --> 07:34.162
which was brought about because you were
recklessly pursuing your potential.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.873
Do you wanna talk us through
what happened?

07:35.873 --> 07:38.083
<i>Well, you all know what happened, Dusty.</i>

07:38.083 --> 07:40.169
<i>Jacob Kovac saved my dang life.</i>

07:40.169 --> 07:42.963
Yeah, okay, but right before
that happened, what happened?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.798
<i>Well, I was pursuing my potential</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:46.133
and having the time of my life.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.427
I can't wait to get back on my bike.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.180
But, you know, in the meantime,

07:51.180 --> 07:54.141
I have Mr. Malik here keeping me company.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.436
- <i>Hello, students!</i>
- Hello.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.771
<i>The only pain I'm in
is the pain of missing the first</i>

07:59.771 --> 08:01.940
<i>homecoming basketball game tonight.</i>

08:01.940 --> 08:05.277
The doctor says I'm in no condition
to do my dunk off the trampoline.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.904
No, that's such a shame.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.489
That's always the highlight
of the pre-game festivities for me,

08:09.489 --> 08:12.075
and now we're all gonna miss out,
simply because you pursued your--

08:12.075 --> 08:14.620
<i>Wait a minute. I have an idea.</i>

08:14.620 --> 08:17.247
<i>What if my hero, Jacob,
does the dunk in my place?</i>

08:17.247 --> 08:20.626
Hell, yeah! My boy Jacob!
It'd be like a tribute to his brother.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.795
Except he could actually dunk,
and you'll be using a trampoline.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.049
You want me to embarrass myself
in front of the entire school?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.510
It's what Kolton would have wanted.

08:39.977 --> 08:40.979
Hey, Jacob.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.943
I just wanted to say how amazing it was,
what you did for Principal Pat.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.946
- It really is like destiny or something.
- It's really not.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.532
Where's your next class?
I can walk with you.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.493
Unless you're not going to class?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.537
I don't actually...

09:00.999 --> 09:02.000
I'm not.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.504
Yeah, I--

09:06.338 --> 09:08.632
I have to go practice for chess club.

09:09.550 --> 09:10.968
- You're in chess club?
- No, not yet.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.761
So that's why I gotta go practice.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.183
He's so fucking hot. Right?

09:20.269 --> 09:23.105
You're asking me if my dead boyfriend's
identical twin is hot?

09:24.481 --> 09:25.482
Sorry.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.026
I guess that was insensitive.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.238
Are you going to the game tonight?

09:32.573 --> 09:33.740
I mean, obviously.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.784
I'm in the band.
We're doing a tribute to Kolton.

09:37.160 --> 09:37.995
Sorry.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.914
I feel like I keep saying
the wrong thing to you.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.293
No, I'm sorry.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.627
Today is just really, really weird.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.212
You can say whatever you want.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.047
Okay.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.468
I think I might try out for chess.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.440
So...

10:09.359 --> 10:11.361
What can I do you for, Jacob?

10:11.987 --> 10:16.533
Well, I've been feeling a little
short of breath sometimes.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.035
Uh-huh.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.412
Any big stresses in your life
at the moment?

10:22.915 --> 10:24.166
I guess, maybe.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.960
Why don't you tell me what's wrong,
and we can figure it out?

10:29.379 --> 10:31.173
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.677
Well, my mom died a few years ago.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.971
But I was barely able to process it,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.974
because I had to hold my family together
'cause my dad got super depressed.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.769
Though he'd never admit it
because he's in denial, but--

10:44.269 --> 10:46.563
I basically had to be the parent
for me and my twin brother,

10:46.563 --> 10:50.651
and then he died in a car accident
a few months ago,

10:50.651 --> 10:52.694
which is also something
I can't talk to my dad about

10:52.694 --> 10:56.573
because of his inability
to talk about anything real.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.701
Which makes it feel like I'm suffocating
in my own house.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.620
Which is a big reason
I smoke a shit-ton of weed,

11:01.620 --> 11:03.455
and then I get a MORPHO card
that says I'm a hero,

11:03.455 --> 11:05.082
but I definitely don't feel like a hero,

11:05.082 --> 11:07.209
because I barely did anything
for Principal Pat.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.002
And I can't possibly be a hero
like my brother,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.964
which makes me feel
like a complete impostor.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.757
You know?

11:16.885 --> 11:17.928
Wow.

11:18.720 --> 11:24.142
I feel exactly the same way.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.103
What?

11:27.229 --> 11:30.148
I just finished med school,
and now I'm running a medical office.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.859
I'm not ready for this.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.945
I have impostor syndrome,
just like you said.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.448
I mean,
that's just one of many things I said.

11:38.448 --> 11:43.036
But-- But I'm sure you're good
at what you do.

11:43.662 --> 11:48.250
I mean, I thought I was,
till I got this.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.341
Yeah, that's less than ideal, but...

11:56.842 --> 11:58.051
It's freaking me out.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.762
When patients come in, my mind goes blank.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.348
All medical knowledge
just flies out the window.

12:03.348 --> 12:08.478
If I see something I don't recognize,
I just say, "It's nothing."

12:09.605 --> 12:13.275
It's really bad.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.618
So, what should I do
about my panic attacks?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.538
Well, as I said,
my mind is literally blank,

12:26.538 --> 12:28.957
but if you figure something out,
please let me know.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.627
Okay?

12:32.503 --> 12:33.545
Okay.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.134
You gotta break away.
We gotta find you a new man.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.803
One more, one more. Yes! Great move!

12:41.803 --> 12:45.390
- Hey...
- Jake. Jacob. Look who stopped by.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.060
Yeah. I came over to see
how your dad was doing.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.645
'Cause of the tribute
to Kolton at the game.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.146
So thoughtful, right?

12:51.146 --> 12:53.190
I told her she should stop by
whenever she wants.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.652
And she told me
you're doing the dunk tonight!

12:56.652 --> 12:57.778
You kidding me?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.696
My hero-boy doing the dunk?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.907
Yeah. I'm super stoked about it.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.493
What's happening here?

13:04.493 --> 13:07.329
Well, since I quit my job-- I quit my job.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.498
I thought I'd get things accomplished.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.375
And look at all this great stuff
I'm finding.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.335
Look at this thing, huh?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.463
Yeah, I'm really starting to see
the benefits of your unemployment.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.549
Look, I found a bunch
of Kolton's old stuff.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.302
Kolton's jersey.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.472
You wanna wear it for the dunk?
As a tribute to Kolton?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.182
I don't think that's a good idea.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.518
I don't even wanna do the dunk.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.770
You're gonna be great. Isn't he?

13:32.271 --> 13:34.231
Come on. I can teach you.

13:38.110 --> 13:41.154
I don't have a trampoline,
but I can build you a ramp.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.740
I'm gonna chop up some wood.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.371
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't think anyone expects you

13:49.371 --> 13:51.039
to, like, get the ball in.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.542
Principal Pat never misses.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.210
Okay.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.880
I've been watching videos of her dunks,
and it's like--

14:01.633 --> 14:02.509
Okay.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.803
She got a slow start, but...

14:07.347 --> 14:10.267
- Wow! She actually gets some serious air.
- Insane air.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.771
You're not actually gonna wear that
to the game, are you?

14:17.274 --> 14:18.609
I mean,

14:18.609 --> 14:22.821
it's the first time I've heard my dad
say Kolton's name since he died, so...

14:23.488 --> 14:25.449
I feel like I don't wanna
shut him down right now.

14:25.949 --> 14:26.992
Yeah.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.704
I'm just glad he didn't ask me
to wear Kolton's jockstrap.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.624
Yeah, I don't think you actually need
a jock for basketball, but...

14:33.624 --> 14:35.542
Okay.
I didn't know you were such an expert.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.668
Maybe you should do it.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.087
Wear Kolton's jock? I'd be honored.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.060
All right. Pinot for the lady.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.144
Yeah.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.773
- And a ginger ale for the man of God.
- Thank you.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.358
- Yeah.
- Wait, hold up. Hana. Hold up.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.485
Hana's new in town.
She doesn't quite know what's going on.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.736
No, I think I get it.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.155
You guys all get drunk
and go to your kids' basketball games.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.114
Yes.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.034
Actually,
I'm going as an alumnus this evening.

15:09.034 --> 15:12.538
I played a little hoop back in my day,
on top of hockey and track--

15:12.538 --> 15:13.455
I was on the team too.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.332
And Cass was there. Always cheering me on.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.918
I was a cheerleader,
so I cheered on everyone.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.128
I just cheered for Jason Rodriguez.

15:20.128 --> 15:24.049
Remember? He had that tattoo
of an eagle on his pelvic mound.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.843
- Oh, God.
- On his pelvic mound?

15:25.843 --> 15:27.594
I'll admit. I love a man with a tattoo.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.139
You love a guy with a tattoo?

15:31.139 --> 15:34.518
Okay, Cassie. Note to self.
Hey, remember senior year--

15:34.518 --> 15:35.727
Father Reuben, you weren't there.

15:35.727 --> 15:39.189
So, you might like to know
that legend has it, and the legend is true

15:39.189 --> 15:41.400
that your boy scored
a half-court buzzer-beater.

15:41.984 --> 15:42.901
Yeah, nothing but net.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.029
Sounds like something
worth holding on to decades later.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.365
- Didn't we lose that game?
- Yes, we did. By a lot.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.702
Yeah. Dusty had a clear view of
the scoreboard from the bench.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.204
- I got some time--
- But nobody remembers the score, Big D.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.164
They just remember the man and the ball.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.835
Anyway. Enough about my triumphs.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.378
I wanna guess everybody's MORPHO card.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.172
Let's not do that. We don't wanna.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.841
- I'm gonna clear these glasses.
- Obviously yours is "Party Pooper."

16:05.841 --> 16:08.093
But no, seriously, let me guess, bro.
Yours is...

16:09.219 --> 16:11.680
Your potential is "Man." Or "Generic Man."

16:11.680 --> 16:13.307
I got "Teacher Whistler."

16:13.307 --> 16:15.350
Yes. And in my opinion,

16:15.350 --> 16:17.603
the best teacher whistler in town.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.813
Boring. Okay. Nat, you're next.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.398
Definitely got "Storyteller."

16:21.398 --> 16:22.900
Who told you?

16:24.067 --> 16:26.612
Father Reuben. "Priest," obviously.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.615
Actually, I haven't used the machine,
and I don't plan to.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.949
That's probably smart.

16:30.949 --> 16:34.119
Because if you don't get "Priest,"
people won't trust you.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.496
Because the machine
knows everything apparently.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.333
I bet you'd get "Priest," Father.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.543
Save those two bucks for something else.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.503
Now, Cass.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.547
Cass, Cass, Cassie, Cass. My Cass.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.467
Okay. My initial thought is something
like "Model" or "Movie Star."

16:48.467 --> 16:51.512
Maybe even "Goddess."
But I feel like it might be more specific.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.014
Can you just guess,
so we can go to the game?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.807
Hold on.
It's gonna take me a second to figure out

16:55.807 --> 16:57.893
what the smartest,
most beautiful woman in town got.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.938
But I'm stumped.
Is "Perfection" a potential?

17:00.938 --> 17:02.564
No, but let me help you out.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.317
Because I got "Royalty."

17:05.317 --> 17:08.403
Of course, dude.
That makes complete and total sense to me.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.988
Also, I would really like one of those.

17:09.988 --> 17:13.157
- I can make you one. I made that one.
- Yes, but mine is gonna say "Superstar,"

17:13.157 --> 17:16.244
which actually pairs very well
with "Royalty," if you think about it.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.829
But... what I'm confused about, though,

17:18.829 --> 17:21.333
is how "Teacher" and "Royalty"
make sense together?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.960
"Teacher/Whistler."

17:22.960 --> 17:25.587
They make sense together because we
make sense together, which is why

17:25.587 --> 17:29.550
- we've been together for 23 years.
- Three... Yeah.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.511
And also, those cards,
they do not tell you everything, okay?

17:32.511 --> 17:36.807
Because "Teacher Whistler" is not
necessarily all that Dusty is or can be.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.101
- So, there.
- Oh, really?

17:39.101 --> 17:40.894
Then be something else, Big D.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.105
- Can we get some wings?
- Yeah.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.357
Yes, wings. That's a good idea.

17:49.653 --> 17:54.825
Good evening, Hooves fans,
or should I say, "Welcome, Hoovers!"

17:58.370 --> 18:01.874
Now, as we welcome you back
to another great season,

18:02.583 --> 18:04.960
I am proud
to announce that tonight's game

18:04.960 --> 18:09.214
is dedicated to the memory
of Kolton Kovac.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.384
Kolton wasn't just
the captain of our team,

18:13.051 --> 18:15.095
he was the captain of our hearts.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.098
He was quite simply, an angel.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.728
Which is why, tonight,
the Deerfield High Marching Band

18:22.728 --> 18:27.608
will be performing "Angel" by Shaggy,
featuring Rayvon.

18:27.608 --> 18:28.775
Oh, fuck.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.680
Okay. We gotta go.
Who's gonna finish the hot wings?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.098
I'll get in on it.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.934
No, careful, Cassie.
They're hot wings.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.020
- So?
- Well, since when do you like hot wings?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.522
Since always.

19:06.522 --> 19:09.024
What? We always get honey garlic.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.400
Because you like honey garlic.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.779
Oh, no. I didn't mean to start something.
Please don't fight, you guys.

19:13.779 --> 19:17.074
Look, I've always liked spicy stuff.
It was just, you know, you really...

19:17.074 --> 19:19.952
you really went off the deep end that time
we ordered medium salsa by accident.

19:19.952 --> 19:23.789
- Well, my tongue nearly burned off, so...
- Which is why we always get honey garlic.

19:23.789 --> 19:25.457
You guys are gonna miss the tip-off.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.501
I will get the check. You should go.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.919
Aren't you coming, Father?

19:28.919 --> 19:30.629
I'm not much of a sports fan, so...

19:30.629 --> 19:32.047
- Thank you.
- Bless you.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.715
You're gonna have
the bar to yourself, Father.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.843
You might even have
the whole town to yourself.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.095
Be a good boy, Father.

19:38.679 --> 19:40.722
Come on, Hoovers! Game time, baby!

19:40.722 --> 19:43.100
Let's get this! Go, Hooves, go!

19:44.059 --> 19:46.228
- Go, Hooves, go! Go, Hooves, go!
- Wow.

19:46.812 --> 19:48.438
- Thank you.
- Figured you need this.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.399
After five minutes with Giorgio,
anyone would.

19:50.399 --> 19:53.360
I actually like him.
He's super grounded and humble.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.112
Speaks at the appropriate volume.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.197
He's an inspiration.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.490
Just incredible.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.542
Hey.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.669
How'd practice with your dad go?

20:13.630 --> 20:16.049
Bad enough that I guess
he decided not to come.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.760
We were supposed to meet here, but...

20:20.262 --> 20:21.305
That sucks.

20:21.972 --> 20:23.473
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

20:23.473 --> 20:26.018
I think my parents missed
my big sousaphone performance.

20:26.018 --> 20:28.270
That was amazing, by the way.

20:28.896 --> 20:33.233
The big sousaphone was,
you know, definitely my favorite part.

20:33.817 --> 20:34.860
Thanks.

20:35.569 --> 20:38.155
It's not a "bigger" sousaphone.

20:38.989 --> 20:42.784
Got it. It's a "big" performance.
Normal sousaphone.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.121
Coach Eagleson originally wanted us
to play "It Wasn't Me."

20:46.622 --> 20:48.290
Then I managed
to talk him down to "Angel,"

20:48.290 --> 20:50.042
which still doesn't make any sense.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.127
It's about this guy
who has trouble being monogamous.

20:52.127 --> 20:56.423
You can't blame Coach Eagleson.
I mean, Kolton was a huge Shaggy fan.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.176
Yeah. Total Shag head.

21:01.762 --> 21:02.971
Shouldn't you be playing right now?

21:02.971 --> 21:04.640
You know how heavy this thing is?

21:05.140 --> 21:07.351
I don't think anyone will notice. Or care.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.691
Trina's gonna be so mad.
Do you see her? Do you see her?

21:14.691 --> 21:16.860
Why would she be mad?
She hates when we come to her concerts.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.112
Well, you told me
that the game started at 8:00.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.032
Yeah, well, you told me
that you liked honey and garlic wings, so...

21:22.658 --> 21:23.784
Oh, my God. Dusty.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.953
I like different kinds of wings.
Is that such a big deal?

21:25.953 --> 21:27.746
It wouldn't have been a big deal
if you told me

21:27.746 --> 21:29.248
at some point in our relationship.

21:29.248 --> 21:31.500
I just went on thinking that you
were my honey and garlic girl.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.628
But no, no.
You like spicy food and tattooed men.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.255
What do I find out next?

21:36.255 --> 21:37.756
You also enjoy meth?

21:38.507 --> 21:40.008
No. You found my meth?

21:40.008 --> 21:42.928
Okay. Let's go, slowpokes!
The game's about to start.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.721
Clear the court. Respect the players.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.224
Come on, "alumnuses," over here!

21:48.267 --> 21:51.687
Cass. I hope people
don't notice us in our funky sweatshirts.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.605
I hope that they do.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.400
Now, I would've ordered hot wings
if I'd known.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.609
Or at least half and half.

21:57.609 --> 22:00.487
It's just-- How am I supposed
to know that you want something different

22:00.487 --> 22:01.572
if you don't tell me?

22:01.572 --> 22:03.448
Well, I'm telling you now.

22:03.949 --> 22:06.201
And that's gotta be a good thing, right?

22:06.201 --> 22:08.745
I mean, we can still surprise each other.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.417
Let's go, Hooves!

22:13.417 --> 22:17.004
- Go, Hooves!
- Let's go, Hooves! Let's get it, Hooves!

22:51.371 --> 22:52.456
Something good, I hope?

22:56.877 --> 22:57.920
Are you kidding me?

22:59.129 --> 23:01.924
As if we needed any more proof
that this thing works.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.467
I'm gonna get my camera.

23:16.438 --> 23:20.776
And now, because Principal Pat
couldn't be here tonight,

23:21.944 --> 23:27.574
to perform the ceremonial opening dunk,
Deerfield High's own hero,

23:28.200 --> 23:33.163
and Kolton Kovac's loving brother,
Jacob Kovac!

23:36.875 --> 23:40.170
- Yeah, go, Jacob!
- Let's go, Jacob!

23:40.170 --> 23:44.508
Come on! Let's go! Jacob!

23:49.221 --> 23:50.931
They're making Jacob do the dunk?

23:51.515 --> 23:52.933
How is that even a thing?

23:52.933 --> 23:54.768
It's supposed to be for charity.

23:54.768 --> 23:58.188
Principal Pat said she'd give a 1,000
bucks to the school library if she missed,

23:58.188 --> 23:59.857
and she's never missed.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.984
Which is why our library is just terrible.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.486
Oh, my gosh. Poor thing.
He's probably freaking out.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.030
- We have to show him that we love him.
- Right.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.617
- Cass, what are you doing?
- Yes, Cassie.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.286
Everything you do is amazing.

24:13.704 --> 24:15.247
Hi. Sorry, Coach. Hey.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.668
Hey! Hey! Deerfield!

24:20.961 --> 24:24.965
All right, guys. Let's show our guy
some love and some support, yeah?

24:24.965 --> 24:26.508
All right, let's go! Let's go.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.807
- Kovac! Kovac!
- Kovac!

24:33.807 --> 24:34.850
Kovac!

25:10.761 --> 25:12.137
Let's go, Jacob!

25:13.430 --> 25:14.932
Game time!

25:14.932 --> 25:17.392
So you want me to throw this
to you when you hit the trampoline?

25:17.392 --> 25:18.977
I don't think I need to add any steps.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.188
Okay. But listen to me.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.191
People are gonna think
that you can't do this--

25:24.191 --> 25:27.110
- I know I can't do this.
- You've got this.

25:28.654 --> 25:29.488
Okay.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.450
You got it.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.955
Where did that come from?

25:37.955 --> 25:41.208
I don't know. I was just feeling myself.

25:43.794 --> 25:44.878
Go, Jacob!

25:52.719 --> 25:54.638
You got this.

26:14.992 --> 26:15.993
No!

26:24.877 --> 26:26.628
- Not good.
- He's moving. He's moving.

26:27.588 --> 26:31.925
We just got $1,000 for the library,
so... Hey!

26:33.468 --> 26:35.179
Books! Books!

26:35.179 --> 26:39.600
- Books! Books! Books! Books! Books!
- Books! Books! Books! Books!
