00:19.394 --> 00:21.188

00:21.229 --> 00:23.106

05:37.045 --> 05:39.047
The menu is set.'

05:39.089 --> 05:41.300
'And these new caterers

05:39.089 --> 05:41.300
I found are fabulous.'

05:41.340 --> 05:43.177
'All you have to do

05:41.340 --> 05:43.177
is smile and make sure'

05:43.218 --> 05:44.427
'everyone's cocktails

05:43.218 --> 05:44.427
are replenished.'

05:44.469 --> 05:45.720
Well--

05:45.762 --> 05:48.140
'Just picture that snake

05:45.762 --> 05:48.140
doing the splits.'

05:49.599 --> 05:53.187
Um, okay, grandma.

05:49.599 --> 05:53.187
I'll help you out.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.064
'Oh, bless you,

05:53.228 --> 05:56.064
I'll check in a little later'

05:56.106 --> 05:58.357
'and give you a briefing

05:56.106 --> 05:58.357
about some of the canapes.'

05:58.399 --> 06:00.485
Good, 'cause I-I'm rusty

05:58.399 --> 06:00.485
on canapes.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.780
- 'Call you later.'

06:00.527 --> 06:03.780
- Okay, bye, grandma. Stay warm.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.741
[sighs]

06:08.451 --> 06:10.120
Maid?

06:10.162 --> 06:13.372
No, this is not going to work.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.372
Maid?

06:13.414 --> 06:16.335
A bath? A baptism

06:13.414 --> 06:16.335
is nothing like taking a bath.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.671
I'm not saying it's a bath, I'm

06:16.375 --> 06:19.671
just saying if you don't believe

06:19.713 --> 06:21.380
in the religious aspect of it

06:21.422 --> 06:24.592
then it's like a bath, as

06:21.422 --> 06:24.592
simple and as brief as a bath.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.845
- Coffee.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.845
- It is so not like a bath.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.140
[stammering]

06:26.887 --> 06:30.140
When you take a bath, there are

06:26.887 --> 06:30.140
candles and-and water-warped

06:30.182 --> 06:32.391
entertainment weeklies to read,

06:30.182 --> 06:32.391
and soap.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.393
There are not people

06:32.433 --> 06:34.393
standing around

06:34.435 --> 06:36.437
praying over you, at least

06:34.435 --> 06:36.437
not when I take a bath.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.065
- Who's getting baptized?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.065
- Oh, our kids are.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.774
Because apparently

06:38.106 --> 06:39.774
we're suddenly super-religious.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.526
No kidding? Hey, would you mind

06:39.816 --> 06:41.526
moving over just a little bit?

06:41.568 --> 06:44.029
Sookie, look at the baptism

06:41.568 --> 06:44.029
as a bargaining chip.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.323
If we give my mother this,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.323
then it will soften the blow

06:46.365 --> 06:48.116
when she finds out that we're

06:46.365 --> 06:48.116
not having any more children

06:48.158 --> 06:49.743
because of the vasectomy.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.079
They'll wanna stay at the house

06:49.784 --> 06:52.079
if we have this baptism.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.581
- Your whole family.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.581
- We'll just have to make room.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.500
How? The house is barely

06:54.622 --> 06:57.500
big enough for us and the kids.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.711
And we'll all end up sleeping

06:57.542 --> 06:59.711
on a leaky air mattress

06:59.753 --> 07:01.922
in the kids' room, and getting

06:59.753 --> 07:01.922
horrible creaks on our neck

07:01.963 --> 07:04.716
while your mother blasts

07:01.963 --> 07:04.716
her Flatt and Scruggs CD.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.676
'And your cousins are gonna

07:04.758 --> 07:06.676
be picking their teeth'

07:06.718 --> 07:08.427
with my Rada paring knives.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.513
Oh, like your family is so easy.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.557
What about the time we had

07:10.555 --> 07:12.557
to see your stuttering cousin

07:12.599 --> 07:15.018
Odell in the worst production

07:12.599 --> 07:15.018
of "Nicholas Nickleby"

07:15.060 --> 07:19.189
known to man? That was

07:15.060 --> 07:19.189
like nine hours of pure hell.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.649
And did I get to fake a heart

07:19.231 --> 07:21.649
attack during intermission?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.360
- No!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.360
- I'm sorry.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.321
There is a difference between

07:23.402 --> 07:26.321
nine hours and three full days.

07:26.363 --> 07:31.034
Okay, there's 48 hours plus 24,

07:26.363 --> 07:31.034
whatever that is, minus 9 hours.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.661
What does that equal?

07:31.076 --> 07:33.661
Forty eight and-and twenty four.

07:33.703 --> 07:38.166
So that's, uh, eight and four,

07:33.703 --> 07:38.166
and that's two and..

07:38.208 --> 07:40.294
Carry the, carry the ten over..

07:40.335 --> 07:42.754
Whoa! Whoa!

07:40.335 --> 07:42.754
Sookie, don't do math.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.464
- You know that hurts your head.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.464
- Ow!

07:44.505 --> 07:47.092
Hey, I have an idea,

07:44.505 --> 07:47.092
if you're gonna have the baptism

07:47.134 --> 07:49.052
and you've got three days

07:47.134 --> 07:49.052
of family in town

07:49.094 --> 07:50.553
how about if they all stay here?

07:50.595 --> 07:53.681
- At the inn?

07:50.595 --> 07:53.681
- Yeah. Just give me the dates.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.642
- We'll work it out.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.642
- That would be okay?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.269
Sookie, you're part owner

07:55.683 --> 07:57.269
of the place.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.187
- Oh, yeah.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.187
- That would really help.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.731
So, cool. I'll take care

07:59.229 --> 08:01.731
of the arrangements.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.234
Sookie, you just deal

08:01.773 --> 08:04.234
with the post-baptism party.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.112
Oh, I didn't know anything

08:04.276 --> 08:07.112
about a post-baptism party.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.114
You didn't tell me anything

08:07.154 --> 08:09.114
about a post-baptism party.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.531
I didn't know myself.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.617
I've got some late summer

08:10.573 --> 08:12.617
salad recipes

08:12.659 --> 08:13.952
I've been wanting

08:12.659 --> 08:13.952
to try out.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.914
Oh, perfect, okay, well,

08:13.994 --> 08:17.914
just let Michel know

08:17.956 --> 08:20.625
how many rooms you need

08:17.956 --> 08:20.625
and I'll see you guys later.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.003
- Thanks, Lorelai.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.003
- Yeah, thanks, hon.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.297
I just need the invoice signed

08:23.044 --> 08:25.297
for the zucchini and I'm off.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.631
Oh, you think I'm taking

08:25.339 --> 08:26.631
this zucchini?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.508
- You ordered them.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.508
- You stressed them out.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.469
- Don't point that thing at me.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.469
- I can tell.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.637
- Get them out of here.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.637
- No, you give me the invoice.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.348
I'll just have one of my guys

08:32.679 --> 08:34.348
get them out of here.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.599
This isn't about the zucchini.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.599
This is about the baptism.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.559
Well, I christen

08:36.641 --> 08:38.559
these vegetables sucky.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.773
Oh, hello, Sarah.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.773
Thank you so much for coming.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.484
E-excuse me. Hold on a sec.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.610
This tray is half empty.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.612
Should we fill it up

08:47.652 --> 08:49.612
to make it look less sad?

08:49.654 --> 08:52.199
- Uh, this is the last tray.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.199
- What?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.534
Oh, no.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.911
Oh, boy, there are only

08:54.575 --> 08:56.911
eight trays of salmon puffs

08:56.953 --> 08:58.372
allotted for the whole night?

08:58.413 --> 09:00.832
This is not good.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.832
This is really not good.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.168
Do you think I should have

09:00.874 --> 09:03.168
staggered their release?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.837
I should have. I should have

09:03.210 --> 09:05.837
staggered their release.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.424
Okay, well, just spread them

09:05.879 --> 09:09.424
out, and then push the shrimp.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.634
Okay, you can circulate now.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.634
Circulate.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.223
Uh, excuse me, uh,

09:13.261 --> 09:16.223
there's garnish on this tray

09:16.264 --> 09:18.725
there shouldn't be.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.725
My grandmother hates garnish.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.852
Here, I'll just, uh,

09:18.766 --> 09:20.852
there you go.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.147
Okay, go, circulate.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.147
Circulate.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.274
- Hello, Lana.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.274
- Hello.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.195
- Nice to see you.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.195
- Carole, hello. Great dress.

09:30.237 --> 09:34.324
Darla, does the pearls council

09:30.237 --> 09:34.324
know about you? Fabulous.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.992
Everything alright

09:34.366 --> 09:35.992
over here, ladies?

09:36.034 --> 09:38.453
Everything's perfect, Rory.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.453
This is a lovely party.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.330
And those salmon puffs, insane.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.916
Aren't they though? Eight trays,

09:40.372 --> 09:42.916
and they're almost gone.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.752
I might have to go grab a pole

09:42.957 --> 09:45.752
and do some fishing.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.670
Let me know

09:45.793 --> 09:47.670
if you need anything.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.466
I like the way

09:49.297 --> 09:51.466
he paints Washington's hair.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.093
(Nora)

09:51.508 --> 09:53.093
It looks so luminous.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.886
If Gilbert Stuart

09:53.134 --> 09:54.886
were alive today

09:54.928 --> 09:56.346
I would absolutely

09:54.928 --> 09:56.346
commission him

09:56.388 --> 09:57.847
to paint a portrait of my Henry.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.849
Well, Martha Washington

09:57.889 --> 09:59.849
had the same impulse.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.810
In 1796, she commissioned Stuart

09:59.891 --> 10:02.810
to do a portrait of her husband

10:02.852 --> 10:04.687
along with the one of herself

10:02.852 --> 10:04.687
to hang at Mount Vernon.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.690
Henry's not Nora's husband.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.690
He's her Springer Spaniel.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.443
- Oh!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.443
- May I freshen your drink?

10:09.484 --> 10:11.194
- Nora?

10:09.484 --> 10:11.194
- Well, thank you, Rory.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.530
That's awfully sweet of you.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.530
Vodka tonic.

10:13.572 --> 10:17.033
- No ice and light on the tonic.

10:13.572 --> 10:17.033
- I'll be right back.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.369
Isn't she just darling?

10:22.581 --> 10:24.458
E-excuse me? Hi.

10:24.499 --> 10:28.420
Um, the woman with the red hair

10:24.499 --> 10:28.420
over by the paintings

10:28.462 --> 10:30.505
could you get her a vodka tonic,

10:28.462 --> 10:30.505
please, ASAP?

10:30.547 --> 10:32.048
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.048
- Thanks.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.968
[sighs]

10:32.090 --> 10:34.968
No-no ice

10:32.090 --> 10:34.968
and light on the tonic.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.770
Oh, Rory, perfect.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.730
Maybe you could help us

10:45.812 --> 10:47.730
with something.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.773
Absolutely.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.317
We're admiring this plant here.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.652
This one with the waxy leaves,

10:50.358 --> 10:52.652
and yet the name for it

10:52.693 --> 10:55.071
has gone right

10:52.693 --> 10:55.071
spot out of our heads.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.574
I'm so sorry.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.574
I'm not sure what it's called.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.951
But I promise to ask

10:57.616 --> 10:59.951
my grandmother and let you know.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.287
Let me just, um, get

10:59.993 --> 11:02.287
your phone number here.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.081
Oops! Garnish.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.125
You just can't

11:05.123 --> 11:07.125
get away from it, huh?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.586
Um, excuse me for a minute.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.839
Hey, I didn't know

11:11.463 --> 11:12.839
you were coming.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.759
Yeah, I forgot

11:12.880 --> 11:16.759
you had a thing today.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.346
Oh, it's okay, 'cause

11:16.801 --> 11:19.346
now I get to show you off.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.266
Nancy, Lucy, I'd like to

11:19.387 --> 11:23.266
introduce Logan Huntzberger.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.436
Logan, this is Nancy Osgood

11:23.308 --> 11:26.436
and Lucy Faxtonfield.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.062
How do you do, Logan?

11:28.104 --> 11:30.106
It's such a pleasure

11:28.104 --> 11:30.106
to meet the young Huntzberger.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.358
Hey.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.945
Uh, Logan, I think

11:32.984 --> 11:35.945
I've-I've told you about Nancy.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.864
She's the one who insists

11:35.987 --> 11:37.864
I look like Clara Barton

11:37.905 --> 11:39.366
which I'm still not sure

11:37.905 --> 11:39.366
is a compliment.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.994
Oh, it's a compliment

11:39.407 --> 11:42.994
of the highest order.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.663
[chuckles]

11:47.207 --> 11:50.210
Um, well,

11:47.207 --> 11:50.210
if you'll excuse us

11:50.251 --> 11:53.046
I think I promised Logan

11:50.251 --> 11:53.046
one of the coveted salmon puffs.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.589
So nice to meet you, Logan.

12:00.136 --> 12:04.224
You want some coffee?

12:00.136 --> 12:04.224
With your scotch?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.184
Sorry, I'm just not

12:04.265 --> 12:06.184
in the mood to deal with this

12:06.226 --> 12:07.768
type of thing right now.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.768
These type of people.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.354
Why? Did something happen?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.189
So how long do you think

12:09.396 --> 12:11.189
this thing's gonna last?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.483
Um, an hour,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.483
hour and a half tops

12:13.525 --> 12:15.569
and then 15 minutes for me

12:13.525 --> 12:15.569
to pay the caterers

12:15.610 --> 12:17.571
and make sure the cleaning staff

12:15.610 --> 12:17.571
knows what to do.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.072
Hey, I have an idea.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.699
Why don't you go hang out

12:19.113 --> 12:20.699
in the pool house

12:20.739 --> 12:22.158
and then I'll come out

12:20.739 --> 12:22.158
as soon as I finish up here?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.160
- We could talk

12:22.200 --> 12:24.160
- Yeah, okay.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.667
We need coffee.

12:30.709 --> 12:34.128
There's no more coffee.

12:30.709 --> 12:34.128
Someone, make me some coffee.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.840
Okay, Paul Anka, dinnertime.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.840
You need to eat tonight, okay?

12:37.882 --> 12:40.301
Now, this is the kibble

12:37.882 --> 12:40.301
you like in the nice

12:40.343 --> 12:44.264
new, yellow bowl

12:40.343 --> 12:44.264
that you picked. I will now..

12:44.305 --> 12:48.935
I will now back out of the room

12:44.305 --> 12:48.935
so you can eat..

12:48.976 --> 12:51.854

13:53.082 --> 13:56.628
love him completely irrelevant.

- Anything is good in a puff.

- Hi.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.427
- Hey, Rory.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.427
- Hey, Colin.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.844
I didn't know

14:04.469 --> 14:05.844
you guys were coming over.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.555
I invited them over.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.555
I hope that's cool.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.223
Oh, yeah.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.223
Of course, it's cool.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.809
I just, I would have

14:09.265 --> 14:10.809
brought more puffs.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.352
- You need a drink.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.352
- Oh, no, I..

14:12.393 --> 14:13.394
Quick, somebody,

14:12.393 --> 14:13.394
give me a sonnet.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.771
Melissa's a poetry major.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.356
"There once was a gal

14:14.813 --> 14:16.356
from Nantucket."

14:16.397 --> 14:19.108
Stop it, Colin.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.108
I'm not trying to propose.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.235
Melissa, do you miss me,

14:19.150 --> 14:21.235
darling?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.825
- Hi. Uh, Logan?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.825
- Yes.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.744
- Who's this girl?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.744
- Ah, that is Colin's milkmaid.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.995
He brought her back

14:29.786 --> 14:30.995
from Holland?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.163
Yes, he did.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.998
Oh! Hi.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.667
I'm Rory.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.667
I've heard a lot about you.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.502
She doesn't understand English.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.003
Oh, sorry.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.005
- Yes, aren't we all?

14:39.045 --> 14:41.005
- Colin, rude.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.923
Everywhere I go,

14:41.047 --> 14:42.923
everything I do, surprise.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.801
- There she is.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.801
- Well, you brought her here.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.553
- What did you expect?

14:44.843 --> 14:46.553
- I don't know what happened?

14:46.594 --> 14:49.514
When we were in the Netherlands,

14:46.594 --> 14:49.514
she seemed so amazing, you know?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.641
But the minute we left,

14:49.556 --> 14:51.641
she began to lose her appeal.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.975
Well, everything looks

14:51.683 --> 14:52.975
appealing when you're

14:53.017 --> 14:54.728
stumbling out

14:53.017 --> 14:54.728
of an Amsterdam coffee bar.

14:54.769 --> 14:57.313
Tell me about it. Uh, I spent

14:54.769 --> 14:57.313
half an hour hitting on a bike.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.482
Maria, you're the only one

14:57.355 --> 14:59.482
that can save me.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.734
Rory, you have to understand.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.402
Milkmaids are like,

15:00.775 --> 15:02.402
iconic over there.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.903
They're practically

15:02.443 --> 15:03.903
Dutch superheroes.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.072
Dating Katrinka was like

15:03.944 --> 15:06.072
dating Wonder Woman.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.782
- Katrinka.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.782
- Yeah.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.158
He's gonna be hearing about

15:07.824 --> 15:09.158
that one for a long time.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.870
Oh, I see, well,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.870
just so you know

15:11.911 --> 15:13.872
I think you're an awfully

15:11.911 --> 15:13.872
sweet girl to date a guy

15:13.913 --> 15:16.332
with such an unfortunate

15:13.913 --> 15:16.332
skin condition.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.751
- Rory.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.751
- Hmm.

15:17.792 --> 15:18.793
Any chance you're

15:17.792 --> 15:18.793
breaking up with Logan

15:18.835 --> 15:19.836
in the next 20 minutes?

15:19.878 --> 15:21.796
- Sorry.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.796
- Damn!

15:21.838 --> 15:25.550
Veronica. Finn.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.550
Still engaged, darling?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.261
Well, I am too, but I'm not

15:25.592 --> 15:28.261
going to say in what.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.972
So this is a surprise. The guys

15:28.302 --> 15:31.972
being here and everything.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.558
Well, Colin just got back.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.558
I hadn't seen him.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.060
- Is that okay?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.060
- Oh, yeah, it's fine.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.729
I just..

15:37.771 --> 15:39.689
Well, you seemed like you were

15:37.771 --> 15:39.689
kind of in a bad mood earlier.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.566
Well, this is how you

15:39.731 --> 15:41.566
get out of a bad mood, Ace.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.067
Hey, let's get something

15:41.608 --> 15:43.067
to eat. I'm starving.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.279
Yes. Chinese food.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.279
No dairy in Chinese food.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.322
Perfect, General Lee's

15:46.320 --> 15:48.322
has that adorable waitress

15:48.364 --> 15:50.241
with a very tiny intellect.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.241
Let's go.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.618
- General Lee's?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.618
- General Lee's.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.327
Just give me a minute,

15:51.659 --> 15:53.327
and I'll go change.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.204
No way, you've got that

15:53.369 --> 15:55.204
hot librarian thing going on.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.873
I like it. Grab a book.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.873
Let's go.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.000
- 'I've got shotgun.'

15:58.499 --> 16:00.000
- No, you don't.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.044
- You're driving.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.044
- I can reach over to steer.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.049
Uh, Colin,

16:03.755 --> 16:07.049
you forgot your milkmaid.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.973
(Lorelai)

16:12.472 --> 16:13.973
'Okay, room five

16:12.472 --> 16:13.973
just checked out.'

16:14.014 --> 16:16.058
So let's give that

16:14.014 --> 16:16.058
to Jackson's sister, Adele.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.561
Put Cousin Rachel in room three

16:16.100 --> 16:18.561
and..

16:18.603 --> 16:20.730
...Aunt Pat and Uncle Rusty

16:18.603 --> 16:20.730
in room six.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.358
Okay, that's two people

16:22.482 --> 16:24.358
in room six.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.527
Aunt Pat and Uncle Rusty,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.527
they're gonna need two keys.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.112
I gave them one.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.112
They can share.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.948
It's the least

16:28.154 --> 16:29.948
the freeloading hicks can do.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.032
They're not freeloading hicks.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.032
They're our guests.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.743
Phew! They are moochers.

16:33.785 --> 16:37.288
They go supermarket-hopping to

16:33.785 --> 16:37.288
gorge themselves on free samples

16:37.330 --> 16:39.999
and get their perfume

16:37.330 --> 16:39.999
from magazine inserts.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.710
You can recognize them from

16:40.040 --> 16:42.710
the paper cuts on their wrists.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.963
Oh! Jackson's not here yet?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.757
No, but his family's arrival

16:45.004 --> 16:47.757
is imminent

16:47.799 --> 16:50.384
so I'm off to nail

16:47.799 --> 16:50.384
the furniture to the floor.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.137
I don't believe it. The whole

16:50.426 --> 16:53.137
clan will be here any minute.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.806
- Sookie, relax.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.806
- I can't relax.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.308
It's Jackson's family,

16:54.848 --> 16:57.308
I-I-I try to say nice things

16:57.350 --> 16:58.852
to them but they always

16:57.350 --> 16:58.852
misinterpret it and they think

16:58.893 --> 17:01.228
I'm insulting them so

16:58.893 --> 17:01.228
I-I've tried being really quiet

17:01.270 --> 17:03.481
and then they get all like,

17:01.270 --> 17:03.481
"Why are you so quiet?"

17:03.523 --> 17:05.566
So I overcompensate

17:03.523 --> 17:05.566
and start cracking jokes

17:05.608 --> 17:07.485
like I'm Carrot Top,

17:05.608 --> 17:07.485
and I start doing funny things

17:07.527 --> 17:09.737
with props, and, uh,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.737
I hate prop comedy.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.281
- We all do, honey.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.281
- They're right behind me.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.826
Jackson, you almost left me

17:12.323 --> 17:14.826
bufferless. What happened?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.744
Aphids happened.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.744
All over my tomatoes.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.412
And I'm squirting them,

17:16.786 --> 17:18.412
and they're multiplying

17:18.454 --> 17:21.415
and I lost track of time so

17:18.454 --> 17:21.415
I start racing over here on foot

17:21.457 --> 17:23.793
and I saw Bo's minivan

17:21.457 --> 17:23.793
just in front of me so I cut

17:23.835 --> 17:25.795
through the thicket and

17:23.835 --> 17:25.795
you know how I hate the thicket?

17:25.837 --> 17:27.547
Just so I could get here first.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.841
[panting]

17:27.588 --> 17:29.841
Oh, my God, my breath.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.841
I can't catch my breath.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.885
I'm breathing out,

17:29.883 --> 17:31.885
but I can't breathe in.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.136
Okay, Jackson, calm down.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.136
You're here, right?

17:34.178 --> 17:36.222
He's here.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.222
Your buffer's here.

17:36.263 --> 17:39.017
I got my buffer.

17:36.263 --> 17:39.017
It'll be okay.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.854
Okay, so, did you tell

17:39.058 --> 17:42.854
hm-hmm about hm-hmm?

17:42.896 --> 17:45.565
No, he's your family.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.565
You tell hm-hmm about hm-hmm.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.067
Why do I get the feeling I'm

17:45.606 --> 17:48.067
at least one of the hm-hmms?

17:48.108 --> 17:50.570
Lorelai, we need

17:48.108 --> 17:50.570
to tell you something.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.613
Remember my brother, Bo?

17:52.655 --> 17:55.658
Uh, dark hair, coarse stubble,

17:52.655 --> 17:55.658
Jefferson Davis tattoo?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.159
- He thinks you're a nympho.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.159
- A what?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.828
It's short for nymphomaniac.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.454
It means you really

17:58.870 --> 18:00.454
dig the fellas.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.081
I know what it means,

18:00.496 --> 18:02.081
but how?

18:02.122 --> 18:03.666
I-I didn't say two words

18:02.122 --> 18:03.666
to the guy when I met him.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.543
I said one hi.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.754
And that was not in response to

18:05.585 --> 18:07.754
What's your sex drive like?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.047
Apparently,

18:07.795 --> 18:09.047
Cousin Rune told him.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.340
Rune? Short guy, light hair.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.009
Thought marijuana

18:11.382 --> 18:13.009
gave your salad zest?

18:13.051 --> 18:15.887
That's the one. Bo said

18:13.051 --> 18:15.887
Rune said you're a horndog.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.263
A horndog?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.139
- His word, not mine.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.139
- His family, not mine.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.435
Mom! Hey, buffer.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.897
- Welcome to the Dragonfly.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.897
- Hi, everybody.

18:25.939 --> 18:30.526
Oh, my, that's quite a bit

18:25.939 --> 18:30.526
of luggage for three days.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.446
'You are just staying

18:30.568 --> 18:33.446
three days, aren't you?'

18:33.487 --> 18:35.656
That's right, little brother,

18:33.487 --> 18:35.656
three days.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.367
Why don't you all relax? I'll

18:35.698 --> 18:38.367
take care of checking us in.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.038
Well, hello, LG.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.290
- Welcome to the Dragonfly Inn.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.290
- Welcome to Bo.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.250
Nice sunglasses.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.250
Very risky business.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.128
Risky business, huh?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.128
Are you into risky business?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.005
No. All of a sudden,

18:49.169 --> 18:51.005
I hate it.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.590
Tom Cruise in his underwear

18:51.047 --> 18:52.590
makes me wanna barf.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.801
[inhales deeply]

18:52.632 --> 18:54.801
Would you like to register?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.302
I would love to.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.307
You just signed the blotter.

19:01.348 --> 19:05.478
Oh, whoops.

19:01.348 --> 19:05.478
Sorry. I was distracted.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.981
Well, um, you're in room seven,

19:05.519 --> 19:07.981
so just take a right

19:08.022 --> 19:09.649
at the top of the stairs

19:08.022 --> 19:09.649
and enjoy your stay.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.400
Well, aren't you accommodating?

19:11.442 --> 19:14.320
I guess I'll just go get my

19:11.442 --> 19:14.320
duffel bag out of the minivan.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.156
That's the first time

19:16.155 --> 19:17.156
I ever heard

19:17.197 --> 19:18.825
the word duffel sound dirty.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.078
- I am so, so sorry.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.078
- Alright, here are their keys.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.831
Names are on the envelopes.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.831
They can go up any time.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.916
I am so, so sorry.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.585
Whoa, whoa, Uncle Artie

19:26.958 --> 19:29.585
hugged me too long.

19:29.627 --> 19:33.673
- Lorelai checked Bo in.

19:29.627 --> 19:33.673
- We are so, so sorry.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.508
- Keys!

19:33.714 --> 19:35.508
- Let's get 'em upstairs.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
I got your keys, everybody.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
Come and get them.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.304
Come and get them.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.389
- 'You got your room keys?'

19:40.346 --> 19:42.389
- 'Yeah.'

19:45.768 --> 19:47.812
Just thought I'd give you

19:45.768 --> 19:47.812
my room number, princess.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.314
I have it. Remember, I checked

19:47.854 --> 19:50.314
you in about a minute ago?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.692
Alright, then.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.692
See you soon.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.072
Oh!

20:00.116 --> 20:01.159
[indistinct chattering]

20:03.202 --> 20:05.079
- He asleep?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.079
- He's waiting for his muse.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.831
- Don't say it like that.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.831
- Like what?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.374
All condescending.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.374
It's not cool.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.834
I wasn't condescending.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.752
Songwriting

20:09.876 --> 20:11.752
is about making yourself open

20:11.794 --> 20:14.005
and vulnerable so that

20:11.794 --> 20:14.005
the lyrics come out true.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.256
If I'm being sensitive, that's

20:14.047 --> 20:16.256
a by-product of my craft.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.051
- I hear you.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.051
- Okay.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.678
- Now you just patronized me.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.678
- I wasn't patronizing you.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.429
Carry on.

Hey, you wanna

20:23.931 --> 20:25.141

20:25.183 --> 20:27.894
Oh, yes, yes.

Dude, you said fries,

20:27.935 --> 20:29.687

21:23.616 --> 21:25.576
- This is a vintage cake topper.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.996
Porcelain bisque, hand-painted,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.996

Shoulder pads on the shoulders.

Aah!

21:31.415 --> 21:33.167
I found it at the flea market

21:31.415 --> 21:33.167
this morning.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.377
- It's perfect.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.377
- Perfect for what?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.837
For your and Lorelai's

21:35.419 --> 21:36.837
wedding cake.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.506
- Oh, wow, that's nice.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.506
- Nice? Nice?

21:39.548 --> 21:42.802
It's not nice, it's fate. Look.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.971
Perhaps this looks familiar.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.556
His butt.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.556
It's your butt.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.770
Sookie, stop screaming, "It's

21:50.184 --> 21:52.770
your butt." People are eating.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.068

21:59.110 --> 22:01.779
Oh, when I found this topper,

21:59.110 --> 22:01.779
uh, your whole cake came to me

22:01.821 --> 22:04.657
like in a vision,

22:01.821 --> 22:04.657

22:04.698 --> 22:07.534
with beautiful daisies

22:04.698 --> 22:07.534
made of fondant on the top.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.787
- A cow burger with cheddar.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.787
- 'Thanks.'

22:09.829 --> 22:11.956
So, now that

22:09.829 --> 22:11.956
I know the cake

22:11.998 --> 22:13.415

22:11.998 --> 22:13.415

What do you mean

22:16.085 --> 22:18.045
you don't know?

22:18.087 --> 22:20.422
- I mean I don't know.

- Luke.

Miss Manners said

22:20.464 --> 22:22.049
you're not really engaged

22:22.091 --> 22:24.010
until you have a ring

22:22.091 --> 22:24.010
and a date.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.013
Yeah, and it's tacky to drink

22:24.051 --> 22:27.013
from a can, but there you go.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.597
- Luke, please.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.597
- Look.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.309
You know the drill here, Sookie,

22:28.639 --> 22:31.309
we're not setting a date

22:31.349 --> 22:34.061
until things are settled

22:31.349 --> 22:34.061
between Lorelai and Rory.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.189
- And when exactly is that?

22:34.103 --> 22:36.189
- I don't know.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.024
Well, what do you plan

22:36.230 --> 22:38.024
to do about it?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.357
Nothing.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.734
Nothing? What kind

22:39.399 --> 22:40.734
of an answer is that?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.236
Sookie, it's between them.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.113
Me and my butt

22:42.278 --> 22:44.113
are staying out of it.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.073
Oh, come on, you know

22:44.155 --> 22:46.073
this whole non-talking thing

22:46.115 --> 22:48.868
between Lorelai and Rory

22:46.115 --> 22:48.868
is ridiculous, and you know it.

22:48.909 --> 22:52.288
I do know it. Your grilled

22:48.909 --> 22:52.288
cheese, double order of fries.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.623
Well, all I can say is that

22:52.330 --> 22:54.623
those two would better make up

23:27.948 --> 23:29.742
What is going on?

23:27.948 --> 23:29.742
Wh-what is that?

23:29.783 --> 23:34.121
Hey, this is the G5 dual 2.3

23:29.783 --> 23:34.121
with a one gig ram upgrade.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.915
And this three and a half inch

23:34.163 --> 23:35.915
aluminum casing

23:35.956 --> 23:38.125
houses a 300 gig hard drive.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.378
And we got pro tools too,

23:38.167 --> 23:40.378
we're gonna be able to record

23:40.418 --> 23:43.130
like a million tracks

23:40.418 --> 23:43.130
every song, we can burn, mix

23:43.172 --> 23:45.049
and edit our own CDs.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.049
It's gonna be nuts.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.218
Yeah, just as soon as we

23:45.091 --> 23:47.218
figure out how to turn it on.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.303
But how? When did..

23:50.388 --> 23:52.181
Oh, my God! The tour money.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.602
'You went into

23:54.392 --> 23:56.602
my underwear drawer?'

23:58.604 --> 24:01.274
I cannot believe that you went

23:58.604 --> 24:01.274
into my underwear drawer.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.359
But that's where

24:01.315 --> 24:03.359
the tour money was.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.985
But that was

24:03.401 --> 24:04.985
my underwear drawer.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.653
It was business,

24:05.027 --> 24:06.653
not pleasure, Lane.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.155
I had my eyes closed

24:06.695 --> 24:08.155
the entire time.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.074
- It was all by feel.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.074
- That was my room.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.534
My private inner sanctum,

24:10.116 --> 24:12.534
and you ransacked it.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.412
Hey, we could be mad too,

24:12.576 --> 24:14.412
you know?

24:14.452 --> 24:16.163
Frankly, the fact that

24:14.452 --> 24:16.163
you felt you had to hide

24:16.205 --> 24:17.748
the tour money from us

24:16.205 --> 24:17.748
is pretty insulting.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.292
Yeah, and that money was

24:17.790 --> 24:19.292
for recording equipment

24:19.333 --> 24:20.793
anyway so what's the big deal?

24:20.834 --> 24:23.212
But did you at least

24:20.834 --> 24:23.212
shop around?

24:23.254 --> 24:26.006
I mean, did you go through

24:23.254 --> 24:26.006
the stack of research I have

24:26.048 --> 24:27.800
on recording equipment,

24:26.048 --> 24:27.800
cost comparisons

24:27.841 --> 24:30.261
audio magazine articles? Did you

24:27.841 --> 24:30.261
happen to look at any of that?

24:30.303 --> 24:32.263
Jeez, we didn't go through

24:30.303 --> 24:32.263
all your stuff, Lane.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.722
I can't believe

24:32.305 --> 24:33.722
you just went out

24:33.764 --> 24:35.308
and spent nine grand

24:33.764 --> 24:35.308
without talking to me.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.684
It wasn't the plan, I mean,

24:35.349 --> 24:37.684
we just cruised by the store

24:37.726 --> 24:40.396
to get a microcassette recorder,

24:37.726 --> 24:40.396
so I could preserve my tunes.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.315
- And there was this sales guy--

24:40.438 --> 24:42.315
- A great guy.

24:42.356 --> 24:45.109
A really great guy, and we ended

24:42.356 --> 24:45.109
up talking to him about music.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.403
- And Zach sang him his tune.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.403
- Which he totally dug.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.280
- Reminded him of early Smiths.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.280
- Great guy.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.573
He was, and he was like,

24:49.322 --> 24:51.573
"You should get this."

24:51.615 --> 24:53.451
And he was like,

24:51.615 --> 24:53.451
"This is the last day

24:53.491 --> 24:55.744
of our once-a-year sale, and

24:53.491 --> 24:55.744
everything's 30 percent off."

24:55.786 --> 24:57.288
'And he showed us

24:55.786 --> 24:57.288
this whole system.'

24:57.330 --> 24:58.914
(Brian)

24:57.330 --> 24:58.914
'He spent like an hour with us.'

24:58.956 --> 25:00.498
- Totally great guy.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.498
- He thinks we're gonna be huge.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.460
- Was there change?

25:00.540 --> 25:02.460
- Huh?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.295
Did the totally great guy

25:02.500 --> 25:04.295
give you any change?

25:06.922 --> 25:07.881
[screaming]

25:09.925 --> 25:11.135
She totally

25:09.925 --> 25:11.135
would have liked him.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.387
'Cause he was a great guy.

25:13.429 --> 25:16.307
I believe Jackson's Aunt Pat

25:13.429 --> 25:16.307
is borrowing DVDs

25:16.349 --> 25:19.517
from our collection

25:16.349 --> 25:19.517
and secretly burning copies

25:19.559 --> 25:22.646
for her own DVD library.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.358
What makes you think

25:22.688 --> 25:25.358
she's not watching the DVDs?

25:25.399 --> 25:28.027
The Bellevilles are freeloaders.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.027
The whole lot of them.

25:28.068 --> 25:31.864
They are as cheap as tan

25:28.068 --> 25:31.864
panty hose with white sandals.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.992
Plus, I believe

25:31.905 --> 25:34.992
they have emptied all the booze

25:35.034 --> 25:38.245
from the minibars upstairs

25:35.034 --> 25:38.245
into their own flask

25:38.287 --> 25:41.290
and then refilled the bottles

25:38.287 --> 25:41.290
with water.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.833
Can I interest you

25:41.332 --> 25:42.833
in a sick day?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.711
But I would not give them

25:42.875 --> 25:45.711
the satisfaction.

25:45.752 --> 25:50.508
Oh, how proud a family reunion

25:45.752 --> 25:50.508
must be for you.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.592
- He's snarky.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.592
- And sarcastic.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.594
- He's snar-castic.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.594
- Hey, do you have a minute?

25:54.636 --> 25:56.430
I wanna ask you something

25:54.636 --> 25:56.430
kind of important.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.849
Oh, sure, I've got

25:56.472 --> 25:58.849
nothing but minutes.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.477
Well, I was wondering

25:58.891 --> 26:01.477
if you would honor

26:01.519 --> 26:03.896
me and Jackson by being

26:01.519 --> 26:03.896
Martha's godmother.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.106
[gasps]

26:03.937 --> 26:06.106
Oh, wow.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.234
Oh, is that a good oh, wow,

26:06.148 --> 26:08.234
or a bad oh, wow?

26:08.275 --> 26:10.361
Uh, it's just oh, wow.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.987
The whole idea of me

26:10.403 --> 26:11.987
being a godmother.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.906
I never thought of myself

26:12.029 --> 26:13.906
as the godmother type.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.324
Would I need a wand?

26:15.366 --> 26:17.159
I think you can pull it off

26:15.366 --> 26:17.159
without it.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.994
Oh, jeez, Sookie, I'm touched.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.787
I would love

26:19.036 --> 26:20.787
to be Martha's godmother.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.832
Great. Oh, I'm so happy you said

26:20.829 --> 26:23.832
yes. It's going to be great.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.751
And we're gonna baptize

26:23.874 --> 26:25.751
both kids at once

26:25.792 --> 26:28.295
so Davey's gonna need

26:25.792 --> 26:28.295
a godmother too

26:28.337 --> 26:30.672
and I thought, "How about Rory?"

26:30.714 --> 26:31.924
Rory, huh?

26:31.965 --> 26:33.551
Yeah, I thought

26:31.965 --> 26:33.551
it would be fun

26:33.591 --> 26:35.593
and I know it's weird

26:33.591 --> 26:35.593
with you two now

26:35.635 --> 26:37.971
but there's really no one else

26:35.635 --> 26:37.971
I'm close to to ask.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.681
Oh, yeah?

26:39.723 --> 26:41.683
Uh, oh, what about your friend

26:39.723 --> 26:41.683
Kat from the culinary institute?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.477
You guys roomed together

26:41.725 --> 26:43.477
in college.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.563
- She's been institutionalized.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.563
- What? Really?

26:45.603 --> 26:48.148
Oh, yeah. She shaved her head.

26:45.603 --> 26:48.148
She thinks she's Susan Powter.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.568
- Ooh, sad.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.568
- Well, how about Theresa?

26:50.608 --> 26:52.069
She lived next door to you

26:50.608 --> 26:52.069
growing up.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.071
Aren't her husband

26:52.111 --> 26:54.071
and Jackson best friends?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.155
She moved.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.449
- She moved?

26:55.197 --> 26:56.449
- To Peru.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.200
- When?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.200
- Yesterday, actually.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.618
- Tall, skinny Margo?

26:58.242 --> 27:00.618
- Has an inner ear problem.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.955
Frankly, I'm a little worried

27:00.660 --> 27:02.955
that she'll lose her balance

27:02.996 --> 27:04.706
holding the baby

27:02.996 --> 27:04.706
and fall right into the water.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.792
She's tall, so that, you know,

27:04.748 --> 27:06.792
that's a long way to fall.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.586
'But, hey, look,

27:06.833 --> 27:08.586
if you don't wanna do it'

27:08.626 --> 27:10.087
or you don't want me to ask Rory

27:10.129 --> 27:12.423
then I'll-I'll

27:10.129 --> 27:12.423
totally understand.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.259
I'm sure Jackson will

27:12.465 --> 27:15.259
understand too, and Martha.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.429
Hey, you gotta-gotta do

27:15.301 --> 27:18.429
what you gotta do.

27:18.471 --> 27:22.558
No, no, it's okay.

27:18.471 --> 27:22.558
Um, I'll do it.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.143
- You will?

27:22.600 --> 27:24.143
- Of course, I will.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.354
Oh, thank you. Now,

27:24.184 --> 27:27.354
it's gonna be a perfect day.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.238
[alarm ringing]

27:49.084 --> 27:50.377
Which one goes better

27:49.084 --> 27:50.377
with a baby?

27:50.419 --> 27:52.338
[sighs]

27:52.379 --> 27:54.047
I like the green one.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.091
It's not too sheer? Because

27:54.089 --> 27:56.091
I'm gonna be in a church.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.802
- Looks good from here.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.802
- Yeah, maybe.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.387
Man, she's good.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.387
She's really good.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.014
- Who?

28:00.429 --> 28:02.014
- Sookie.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.890
This whole baptism thing

28:02.055 --> 28:03.890
is just a ruse

28:03.932 --> 28:05.934
to get me and Rory together.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.934
She's played me.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.478
She's played me

28:05.976 --> 28:07.478
like a Stradivarius.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.686
So don't go then.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.356
- No, I gotta go.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.356
- Why?

28:10.397 --> 28:11.815
Because she asked me

28:10.397 --> 28:11.815
to be a godmother.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.900
- You don't say no to that.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.900
- Why?

28:13.942 --> 28:15.777
Look, I know what she's doing,

28:13.942 --> 28:15.777
and she knows what she's doing

28:15.819 --> 28:17.446
but no one else

28:15.819 --> 28:17.446
knows what she's doing

28:17.488 --> 28:19.657
so on the chance she's not doing

28:17.488 --> 28:19.657
what I think she's doing

28:19.697 --> 28:21.575
which is actually just

28:19.697 --> 28:21.575
doing what she wants to do

28:21.617 --> 28:23.452
then I will be the jerk

28:21.617 --> 28:23.452
who wouldn't be the godmother

28:23.494 --> 28:24.828
to her best friend's baby

28:23.494 --> 28:24.828
'cause she thought

28:24.870 --> 28:26.497
something was happening

28:24.870 --> 28:26.497
that wasn't.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.499
And that will be the story

28:26.539 --> 28:28.499
everyone remembers, understand?

28:28.541 --> 28:30.250
I like the green dress.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.172
[alarm ringing]

28:37.633 --> 28:39.885
Go back to sleep.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.054
I have to go to the baptism.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.724
- Blow it off.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.724
- I can't.

28:45.765 --> 28:48.227
You can do anything. You just

28:45.765 --> 28:48.227
have to believe in yourself.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.396
Did we learn nothing

28:48.268 --> 28:50.396
from "Mad Hot Ballroom?"

28:52.022 --> 28:53.982
I have to go to Stars Hollow.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.361
I have to see my mom.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.990
One, two, cha cha cha.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.493
Oh, okay.

29:04.535 --> 29:08.288
Nothing left to do but get up

29:04.535 --> 29:08.288
and face the music.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.175
Which goes better

29:17.423 --> 29:20.175
with a baby?

29:20.217 --> 29:22.636
[guitar music]

29:44.866 --> 29:46.410
You're wasting your time, Lane.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.579
That manual's just

29:46.452 --> 29:48.579
a bunch of gobbledygook.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.997
Got to be R2-D2

29:48.621 --> 29:50.997
to understand that thing.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.041
No, you just have to spend

29:51.039 --> 29:53.041
more than six minutes

29:53.083 --> 29:54.543
trying to figure it out

29:53.083 --> 29:54.543
before giving up.

29:54.585 --> 29:57.296
I can't believe

29:54.585 --> 29:57.296
there's a second C-SPAN.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.715
[knock on door]

29:59.757 --> 30:01.300
- Hi.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.300
- Rory.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.302
Hi.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.302
Am I interrupting anything?

30:03.343 --> 30:04.762
Nah, there's nothing on.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.181
No, you're interrupting

30:04.803 --> 30:08.181
nothing. Come on in.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.642
Wow, this looks very fancy.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.184
Yeah, it's pretty fancy,

30:09.683 --> 30:11.184
alright.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.312
Apparently, it does everything

30:11.226 --> 30:13.312
except turn on.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.105
You look pretty fancy too.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.608
Oh, I'm on my way over

30:15.147 --> 30:17.608
to Sookie's kids' baptism.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.984
I'm gonna be Davey's godmother.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.069
Very religious.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.069
My mother would be impressed.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.781
Hey, is it true you get to keep

30:21.111 --> 30:23.781
the baby if the parents die?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.491
I'm just doing it

30:23.822 --> 30:25.491
as a favor for Sookie.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.743
Godmother, huh?

30:27.785 --> 30:29.244
[imitating Marlon Brando]

30:27.785 --> 30:29.244
Did you make her an offer

30:27.785 --> 30:29.244
she couldn't refuse?

30:29.286 --> 30:31.747
- Dude, you nailed that.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.747
- Thanks.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.625
Come on, I need a break

30:31.789 --> 30:34.625
from the ADD boys.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.670
Whoa! There's a third C-SPAN.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.425
- Room looks the same.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.425
- Yeah.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.719
How come there's a padlock

30:43.467 --> 30:45.719
on your dresser drawer?

30:45.761 --> 30:48.430
- Uh, long story. Here, sit.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.430
- Okay.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.516
So, you look great.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.516
Did you get a haircut?

30:50.557 --> 30:52.768
Yeah. Well, maybe a month ago.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.812
- I like it.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.812
- Thanks. You look good too.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.730
I like the bangs.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.730
Very Marianne Faithfull.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.691
Thanks. I'm hoping

30:56.772 --> 30:58.691
Mick Jagger notices.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.194
- So, you went on tour?

31:00.150 --> 31:02.194
- Yeah, we did.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.903
- And how was it?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.903
- Great.

31:03.945 --> 31:08.742
Great. And, um, how are things

31:03.945 --> 31:08.742
in the Zach department?

31:08.784 --> 31:10.410
I mean, you two

31:08.784 --> 31:10.410
are still together, right?

31:10.452 --> 31:13.955
We are, and it's good.

31:10.452 --> 31:13.955
He's good. We're good.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.082
Gee, how many times

31:13.997 --> 31:16.082
can I use the word good?

31:16.124 --> 31:18.126
[chuckles]

31:16.124 --> 31:18.126
Have you guys..

31:18.168 --> 31:21.380
No, no, no, uh,

31:18.168 --> 31:21.380
we're still not having sex

31:21.421 --> 31:24.132
but I did tell Zach he could

31:21.421 --> 31:24.132
tell the guys we're doing it.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.217
It's a little more

31:24.174 --> 31:25.217
rock 'n' roll.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.844
You are a good girlfriend.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.346
So, how's Logan?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.807
Logan is..

31:31.849 --> 31:33.016
...a constant surprise.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.852
I have trouble

31:33.058 --> 31:34.852
keeping up with him.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.354
He moves a mile a minute,

31:34.893 --> 31:37.354
gets bored in two seconds flat.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.773
He started flying

31:37.396 --> 31:39.773
those scary little planes

31:39.815 --> 31:41.775
that seem like they're

31:39.815 --> 31:41.775
made of<i> papier-mache</i>

31:41.817 --> 31:43.151
which is thrilling,

31:41.817 --> 31:43.151
by the way.

31:43.193 --> 31:45.070
And Logan's good.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.239
Wow. Is this serious?

31:47.280 --> 31:49.991
- Seriously exciting.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.991
- I love that.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.326
Is it hard with him

31:50.033 --> 31:51.326
still at Yale

31:51.368 --> 31:53.286
and you living

31:51.368 --> 31:53.286
with your grandparents?

31:53.328 --> 31:55.831
No, not really.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.831
It's been fine actually.

31:55.873 --> 31:57.957
Taking time off

31:55.873 --> 31:57.957
has been great.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.126
It was absolutely

31:57.999 --> 32:00.126
the right decision for me.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.045
That's good.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.045
That's really good.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.714
Yeah.

32:03.756 --> 32:07.718
Yeah, I just wish that

32:03.756 --> 32:07.718
my mom could understand that.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.469
She's so..

32:09.511 --> 32:11.263
I doubt that she will

32:09.511 --> 32:11.263
talk to me again

32:11.304 --> 32:12.972
until I am back in a dorm room

32:13.014 --> 32:14.974
with a course catalog

32:13.014 --> 32:14.974
on my lap, if then.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.602
I don't know.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.602
Maybe we'll never talk again.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.228
You two? Oh, please.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.647
- We haven't talked in weeks.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.647
- It will blow over.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.776
She didn't tell me when

32:20.689 --> 32:23.776
she and Luke got engaged.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.570
Rory, look at me.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.739
You and your mom

32:26.612 --> 32:28.739
will talk again, this rift

32:28.781 --> 32:31.450
is just nature's attempt

32:28.781 --> 32:31.450
to find some equilibrium.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.578
You and Lorelai have gone too

32:31.491 --> 32:34.578
many years without fighting.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.330
So you had to have one big fight

32:34.620 --> 32:37.330
to make up for it.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.207
Now you've had it,

32:37.372 --> 32:39.207
and soon you'll make up

32:39.249 --> 32:41.835
and then this will all

32:39.249 --> 32:41.835
be just your lost weekend.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.213
- I've missed you.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.213
- I've missed you too.

32:45.255 --> 32:47.299
We can never go this long

32:45.255 --> 32:47.299
without talking again.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.050
- Deal.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.050
- I'll do anything.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.303
- I'll raise carrier pigeons.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.303
- I'll learn Morse code.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.096
I'll send you pigeons,

32:51.344 --> 32:53.096
and you can send me code.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.807
Okay.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.935
Oh, it's 10:30. I have

32:54.848 --> 32:57.935
15 minutes before I have to go.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.812
Now, I wanna hear

32:57.976 --> 32:59.812
all about that tour.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.105
Okay, well,

32:59.853 --> 33:02.105
let's start with the whole

33:02.147 --> 33:03.440
three boys and no shower thing.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.483
Oh, Lord.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.610
[bells tolling]

33:10.614 --> 33:12.532
- You look nice today, Kirk.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.532
- Thanks.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.618
This is the suit

33:12.574 --> 33:14.618
they buried my dad in.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.829
Oh, well..

33:16.870 --> 33:18.664
I think I'm gonna

33:16.870 --> 33:18.664
let that one go.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.332
So, do you know

33:18.705 --> 33:20.332
which is the Davey side

33:20.373 --> 33:22.125
of church

33:20.373 --> 33:22.125
and which is the Martha?

33:22.167 --> 33:23.836
Oh, I don't think

33:22.167 --> 33:23.836
there are sides, Kirk.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.379
It's not like a wedding. I think

33:23.877 --> 33:26.379
we're all on both kids' sides.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.340
I just didn't want

33:26.421 --> 33:28.340
to offend by taking a side

33:28.381 --> 33:29.842
if there are sides.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.302
I've had some contact

33:29.883 --> 33:32.302
with Davey in passing

33:32.344 --> 33:34.638
couple of high-fives,

33:32.344 --> 33:34.638
one or two peekaboo sessions

33:34.680 --> 33:37.015
but I haven't had

33:34.680 --> 33:37.015
much contact with Martha.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.601
She seems more reserved,

33:37.056 --> 33:39.601
elusive.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.562
- There's a bit of Garbo in her.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.562
- 'Jackson was adopted.'

33:42.604 --> 33:43.856
- 'So nice.'

33:42.604 --> 33:43.856
- 'I know.'

33:43.897 --> 33:45.983
[both chuckling]

33:46.024 --> 33:47.609
I just talked

33:46.024 --> 33:47.609
to my former mother

33:47.651 --> 33:49.611
and, oh, you are going

33:47.651 --> 33:49.611
to love this.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.321
Guess who's getting

33:49.653 --> 33:51.321
baptized today?

33:51.363 --> 33:52.489
- Who?

33:51.363 --> 33:52.489
- Me.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.032
- 'What?'

33:52.531 --> 33:54.032
- No!

33:54.073 --> 33:55.826
- Is it Christmas already?

33:54.073 --> 33:55.826
- This isn't funny.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.828
- A-ha!

33:55.868 --> 33:57.828
- You've never been baptized?

33:57.870 --> 33:59.872
Apparently on the day

33:57.870 --> 33:59.872
I was supposed to be baptized

33:59.913 --> 34:01.748
I stuck a quarter up my nose

33:59.913 --> 34:01.748
and had to be taken

34:01.790 --> 34:03.542
to the hospital,

34:01.790 --> 34:03.542
and they never rescheduled.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.586
Well, organizational skills were

34:03.583 --> 34:06.586
never your family's strongpoint.

34:06.628 --> 34:09.006
You know what?

34:06.628 --> 34:09.006
I have had it with my family.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.090
'I want you to march right

34:09.047 --> 34:11.090
over there and tell my mother'

34:11.132 --> 34:13.301
that you're divorcing me

34:11.132 --> 34:13.301
if I get baptized.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.554
Oh, yeah, that will

34:13.343 --> 34:15.554
go over very well.

34:15.595 --> 34:18.515
Okay, fine. Then just say

34:15.595 --> 34:18.515
we're getting separated.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.352
I guess I better go find out

34:20.141 --> 34:22.352
what it means exactly

34:22.394 --> 34:23.937
for a grown man to get baptized.

34:23.979 --> 34:26.105
Oh, my God, are you gonna wear

34:23.979 --> 34:26.105
a giant christening gown?

34:26.147 --> 34:27.607
You're really enjoying this,

34:26.147 --> 34:27.607
aren't you?

34:27.649 --> 34:29.484
Oh, you have no idea.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.699
- Oh, Rory's here.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.699
- Yeah, I see that.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.660
Boy, that's a pretty dress

34:35.741 --> 34:38.660
she's wearing, don't you think?

34:38.702 --> 34:40.871
Sure, it will go good

34:38.702 --> 34:40.871
with a baby.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.205
Well, I better

34:40.913 --> 34:42.205
go check on the kids.

34:42.247 --> 34:43.999
Say hi to Rory for me

34:42.247 --> 34:43.999
if you see her first.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.880
Oh, uh, there you two are.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.880
Good. Uh, do you have a minute?

34:49.922 --> 34:51.339
I was hoping

34:49.922 --> 34:51.339
we could have a quick chat

34:51.381 --> 34:52.883
in my office

34:51.381 --> 34:52.883
before the ceremony.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.676
- Oh, well..

34:52.925 --> 34:54.676
- Um, sure.

34:54.718 --> 34:57.470
Wonderful. Right this way.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.473
So I always like to take a

34:57.512 --> 35:00.473
few minutes before my baptisms

35:00.515 --> 35:02.350
to get to know the godparents

35:00.515 --> 35:02.350
a little bit.

35:02.392 --> 35:05.353
Of course, I already know you

35:02.392 --> 35:05.353
two but I just wanna touch base

35:05.395 --> 35:07.022
and make sure you understand

35:05.395 --> 35:07.022
the obligations

35:07.064 --> 35:08.732
of what you're getting

35:07.064 --> 35:08.732
into here today.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.150
Now, basically,

35:08.774 --> 35:11.150
godparents are responsible

35:11.192 --> 35:13.612
for the spiritual upbringing

35:11.192 --> 35:13.612
of their godchildren.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.781
I certainly hope the parents

35:13.653 --> 35:15.781
throw their two cents in

35:15.822 --> 35:17.783
but the godparents

35:15.822 --> 35:17.783
are vitally important figures

35:17.824 --> 35:19.492
'in a child's life.'

35:19.534 --> 35:22.120
Uh, so, tell me, what are

35:19.534 --> 35:22.120
your religious affiliations?

35:22.161 --> 35:24.623
Oh, well, reverend,

35:22.161 --> 35:24.623
you've known us forever.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.166
Well, yes, I have,

35:24.664 --> 35:27.166
and I still have no idea

35:27.208 --> 35:28.794
what your religious

35:27.208 --> 35:28.794
affiliations are.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.629
- Oh!

35:28.835 --> 35:30.629
- Well..

35:30.670 --> 35:35.216
- We're a bit lapsed.

35:30.670 --> 35:35.216
- Yes. Uh, from?

35:35.258 --> 35:39.345
Well, um, religion, but

35:35.258 --> 35:39.345
you know, I can't speak for Rory

35:39.387 --> 35:44.977
but I have a strong belief

35:39.387 --> 35:44.977
in good, you know, over evil.

35:45.018 --> 35:48.021
I mean, if I was asked

35:45.018 --> 35:48.021
to choose a side..

35:48.063 --> 35:49.815
I read "The Lion, The Witch,

35:48.063 --> 35:49.815
And The Wardrobe."

35:49.856 --> 35:52.025
I have a Bible, although I may

35:49.856 --> 35:52.025
or may not have accidentally

35:52.067 --> 35:54.444
given it to Goodwill,

35:52.067 --> 35:54.444
because I'm remodeling.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.115
But Goodwill is a religious

35:54.486 --> 35:58.115
organization, I think.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.617
But even if it's not. Good will.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.617
It's in the ballpark.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.702
I buy tons

36:00.659 --> 36:02.702
of girl scout cookies.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.705
I have two Mary Is My Homegirl

36:02.744 --> 36:05.705
T-shirts.

36:05.747 --> 36:08.708
Well, these are all very

36:05.747 --> 36:08.708
positive if somewhat irrelevant

36:08.750 --> 36:11.377
things, and it seems like your

36:08.750 --> 36:11.377
hearts are in the right place.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.130
- Absolutely.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.130
- Definitely.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.673
'And it says something

36:13.171 --> 36:14.673
good about you both.'

36:14.714 --> 36:16.883
That when a friend calls you up

36:14.714 --> 36:16.883
and asks a favor

36:16.925 --> 36:18.802
you come through like this.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.470
Right, right.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.347
- Shall we?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.347
- We shall.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.104
So, are you a Davey

36:27.060 --> 36:29.104
or a Martha?

36:29.146 --> 36:31.356
Davey, I bet, right?

36:29.146 --> 36:31.356
He's much more accessible.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.774
He's the Dandy Warhols

36:31.397 --> 36:32.774
to Martha's

36:32.816 --> 36:34.651
Brian Jonestown Massacre.

36:38.237 --> 36:40.740
[coins clanking]

36:38.237 --> 36:40.740
Oh. Dang it!

36:42.492 --> 36:45.078
- Hey, Rory. You look so pretty.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.078
- Hey, Sookie.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.872
Oh, I want a picture of this.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.792
Welcome, everybody.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.252
Jesus tells Nicodemus

36:50.834 --> 36:53.252
in the Fourth Gospel

36:53.294 --> 36:55.672
"Unless one is born

36:53.294 --> 36:55.672
of water and spirit

36:55.714 --> 36:57.799
one cannot enter

36:55.714 --> 36:57.799
the kingdom of God."

36:57.841 --> 37:00.802
'Today, we gather to honor

36:57.841 --> 37:00.802
three individuals'

37:00.844 --> 37:03.513
'as they dedicate themselves

37:00.844 --> 37:03.513
in the first sacrament'

37:03.555 --> 37:07.184
of the faith, and become members

37:03.555 --> 37:07.184
of the body of the church

37:07.225 --> 37:08.894
and the kingdom of God.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.688
Here to bear witness

37:08.935 --> 37:11.688
and offer spiritual support

37:11.730 --> 37:14.524
are Lorelai Gilmore,

37:11.730 --> 37:14.524
godparent to Martha

37:14.566 --> 37:17.235
'Rory Gilmore,

37:14.566 --> 37:17.235
godparent to Davey, and..'

37:17.276 --> 37:19.071
- Uh, Jackson.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.071
- Yo.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.322
Acting as your godparent

37:19.112 --> 37:21.322
will be?

37:21.364 --> 37:24.325
Oh, uh, my brother, Bo,

37:21.364 --> 37:24.325
I guess.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.828
Oh, and, uh,

37:24.367 --> 37:26.828
Bo Belleville will serve

37:26.870 --> 37:29.330
as sponsor and witness

37:26.870 --> 37:29.330
for Jackson.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.290
Uh, will you come up here,

37:29.372 --> 37:31.290
please, Bo?

37:31.332 --> 37:34.252
[coins clanking]

37:31.332 --> 37:34.252
Oh! Oh, bananas.

37:34.293 --> 37:37.422
The candidates for baptism

37:34.293 --> 37:37.422
will now be presented.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.304
We are honored with the

37:42.928 --> 37:45.304
privilege of being here today

37:45.346 --> 37:47.140
to witness and support in faith

37:47.182 --> 37:50.518
the baptism

37:47.182 --> 37:50.518
of David Edward Belleville

37:50.560 --> 37:53.813
'Martha Janice Lori

37:50.560 --> 37:53.813
Ethan Rupert Glenda'

37:53.855 --> 37:56.191
'Carson Daisy

37:53.855 --> 37:56.191
Danny Belleville'

37:56.233 --> 37:58.735
and Jackson Matthew Belleville.

37:58.777 --> 38:02.864
I hereby charge Lorelai Gilmore,

37:58.777 --> 38:02.864
Rory Gilmore, and Bo Belleville

38:02.906 --> 38:05.575
'with the responsibility of

38:02.906 --> 38:05.575
seeing to the spiritual welfare'

38:05.617 --> 38:08.369
of these children

38:05.617 --> 38:08.369
and this believer.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.581
We will now begin a series

38:08.411 --> 38:11.581
of ceremonial questions.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.625
Lorelai Gilmore,

38:11.623 --> 38:13.625
do you renounce Satan

38:13.666 --> 38:16.253
'and all the spiritual forces

38:13.666 --> 38:16.253
that rebel against God?'

38:17.629 --> 38:19.464
[audience murmuring]

38:19.505 --> 38:21.216
- Lorelai?

38:19.505 --> 38:21.216
- What?

38:21.258 --> 38:23.135
[whispering]

38:21.258 --> 38:23.135
Why aren't you renouncing Satan?

38:23.176 --> 38:24.636
He said,

38:23.176 --> 38:24.636
"Do you renounce Satan?"

38:24.677 --> 38:26.596
And you pause. That's not

38:24.677 --> 38:26.596
something you pause about.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.015
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.015
Uh, yes, I renounce Satan.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.349
Okay.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.603
Rory Gilmore,

38:30.391 --> 38:33.603
do you renounce Satan

38:33.645 --> 38:35.105
'and all the spiritual forces

38:33.645 --> 38:35.105
that rebel against God?'

38:35.147 --> 38:36.898
- Did you call Rory?

38:35.147 --> 38:36.898
- What?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.566
Did you call Rory

38:36.940 --> 38:38.566
on her cellphone

38:38.608 --> 38:40.693
and ask her to be a godmother?

38:40.735 --> 38:42.570
- I renounce him.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.570
- Bo Belleville..

38:42.612 --> 38:43.822
What are you whispering about?

38:43.863 --> 38:44.906
I'm just trying

38:43.863 --> 38:44.906
to get some information.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.074
What information?

38:46.116 --> 38:48.076
Satan can kiss my ass.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.078
- Sookie had your phone number?

38:48.118 --> 38:50.078
- What?

38:50.120 --> 38:52.038
She called you

38:50.120 --> 38:52.038
to ask you to be here

38:52.080 --> 38:53.790
which means she must have

38:52.080 --> 38:53.790
had your phone number.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.417
Excuse me. Ladies?

38:56.459 --> 38:59.879
Uh, I'm sorry, reverend. Can you

38:56.459 --> 38:59.879
just give us a moment, please?

39:04.176 --> 39:05.551
What is wrong with you?

39:05.593 --> 39:07.179
Look, it's not like

39:05.593 --> 39:07.179
I really care, okay?

39:07.220 --> 39:08.805
It's not like I was gonna

39:07.220 --> 39:08.805
call you up to chit-chat

39:08.847 --> 39:10.807
or make a date to go

39:08.847 --> 39:10.807
shoe shopping or something.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.892
But shouldn't a mother have

39:10.849 --> 39:12.892
a way to contact her daughter

39:12.934 --> 39:14.811
at least in-in case

39:12.934 --> 39:14.811
of an emergency?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.479
I mean, what if I was in

39:14.853 --> 39:16.479
an accident and I had to have

39:16.521 --> 39:17.981
'a blood transfusion,

39:16.521 --> 39:17.981
you're the only person'

39:18.023 --> 39:19.524
in the world

39:18.023 --> 39:19.524
with the same blood type.

39:19.565 --> 39:20.775
It would really help

39:19.565 --> 39:20.775
to have your phone number.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.194
We are holding up the service.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.361
I just think it's weird

39:22.235 --> 39:23.361
you would give

39:23.402 --> 39:24.737
Sookie your number and not me.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.281
I didn't give Sookie

39:24.779 --> 39:26.281
my new number.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.283
Sookie called grandma,

39:26.323 --> 39:28.283
grandma left me a note

39:28.325 --> 39:29.826
and then I called Sookie back.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.370
And I didn't get a new number.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.370
I lost my phone.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.247
If you lose your phone,

39:32.411 --> 39:34.247
you should suspend your service

39:34.289 --> 39:35.957
until you get a new one.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.335
That way, you get to keep the

39:35.999 --> 39:38.335
same number. Ever hear of that?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.128
'It's ridiculous to get

39:38.376 --> 39:40.128
an entirely new number.'

39:40.170 --> 39:41.963
No one gets

39:40.170 --> 39:41.963
an entirely new number.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.257
Well, next time,

39:42.005 --> 39:44.257
I will suspend my service.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.260
Um, hi, guys.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.260
We kinda need the kids back.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.511
Okay.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.265
[baby crying]

39:52.307 --> 39:54.100
-'That was fun.'

39:52.307 --> 39:54.100
- Hey, godmother.

39:54.142 --> 39:58.146
Hi, so sorry again

39:54.142 --> 39:58.146
for the drama.

39:58.188 --> 39:59.564
You always give me

39:58.188 --> 39:59.564
a good story to tell.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.066
Well, I aim to please.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.235
- I have a confession to make.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.235
- Oh, yeah.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.195
I kind of asked you and Rory

40:03.276 --> 40:05.195
to both be godmothers

40:05.237 --> 40:07.947
because I thought it might

40:05.237 --> 40:07.947
kind of bring you back together.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.782
- 'Patch things up.'

40:07.989 --> 40:09.782
- Well, blow me down.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.450
- Didn't fool you, huh?

40:09.824 --> 40:11.450
- No.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.079
- But the salads are excellent.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.079
- The salads are excellent.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.542
Okay, that's it.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.542
I'll be right back.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.383
- Hi, Bo.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.383
- Hey, darlin'.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.054
What do you say we get

40:28.885 --> 40:31.054
out of these wet clothes?

40:31.096 --> 40:34.557
Listen, Bo, uh, there's been

40:31.096 --> 40:34.557
a misunderstanding here.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.351
What Rune told you about me,

40:34.599 --> 40:36.351
it's not true.

40:36.393 --> 40:37.518
- Really?

40:36.393 --> 40:37.518
- None of it.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.229
- Oh.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.229
- Yeah.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.439
- So you don't have a kid?

40:39.271 --> 40:41.439
- Well, no, I do have a kid.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.149
But you didn't get knocked up

40:41.480 --> 40:43.149
when you were 16?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.442
Well, that part

40:43.191 --> 40:44.442
technically is true.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.735
And he said

40:44.483 --> 40:45.735
you've never been married.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.570
That you're just single

40:45.777 --> 40:47.570
and datin' around.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.740
Well, I've never been married

40:47.612 --> 40:50.740
exactly, but I'm engaged now.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.200
That's pretty steady,

40:50.782 --> 40:52.200
very permanent.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.910
He said you were engaged before.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.870
You know what, it's all true,

40:53.952 --> 40:55.870
okay, I'm a horndog.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.998
So if you'll excuse me,

40:55.912 --> 40:58.998
I'm gonna get some potato salad.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.918
- Potato salad.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.918
- Yeah.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.962
- I get it.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.962
- Okay.

41:06.547 --> 41:10.843
- So, I'm leaving.

41:06.547 --> 41:10.843
- Uh, okay. Drive safe.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.305
Look, I know this is lame

41:10.885 --> 41:13.305
at this point

41:13.346 --> 41:15.307
but you can have my new number

41:13.346 --> 41:15.307
if you want it.

41:15.348 --> 41:18.393
That's okay. I can call mom,

41:15.348 --> 41:18.393
and she can leave you a note.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.730
- Okay.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.191
[guitar music]

41:29.612 --> 41:31.364
[cellphone ringing]

41:33.574 --> 41:34.867
- Hello?

41:33.574 --> 41:34.867
- 'Hey.'

41:34.909 --> 41:36.619
Hey, how was the baptism?

41:36.661 --> 41:38.788
Fine. I don't know.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.957
I don't know what's going on.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.584
I'm not handling things

41:40.999 --> 41:43.584
particularly well these days.

41:43.626 --> 41:46.171
Yeah, I know what you mean.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.089
Logan, are you okay?

41:48.131 --> 41:50.300
I had a talk with my father

41:48.131 --> 41:50.300
the other day

41:50.342 --> 41:52.677
and apparently, I'm going

41:50.342 --> 41:52.677
to graduate this year.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.179
That I'm going

41:52.718 --> 41:54.179
to get my act together

41:54.220 --> 41:55.305
and I'm gonna

41:54.220 --> 41:55.305
become a Huntzberger.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.307
What does that mean?

41:57.349 --> 41:59.351
'I'm going to start attending

41:57.349 --> 41:59.351
shareholder meetings'

41:59.392 --> 42:01.186
letting the boys

41:59.392 --> 42:01.186
see my face around.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.396
It means my preordained life

42:01.227 --> 42:03.396
is kicking in.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.981
'Oh, I'm sorry.'

42:05.023 --> 42:07.942
Hey, always read the fine print

42:05.023 --> 42:07.942
on the family crest.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.361
You know, maybe you can

42:07.984 --> 42:09.361
talk to your dad

42:09.402 --> 42:10.903
and-and tell him how you feel.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.156
Hey, how far away are you

42:10.945 --> 42:13.156
from the airport?

42:13.198 --> 42:14.866
- 'Why?'

42:13.198 --> 42:14.866
- Let's go to New York.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.493
What?

42:16.534 --> 42:19.245
'New York, you and me

42:16.534 --> 42:19.245
right now by helicopter.'

42:19.287 --> 42:20.788
A helicopter?

42:19.287 --> 42:20.788
You're kidding.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.623
We will spend the weekend

42:20.830 --> 42:22.623
at The Pierre.

42:22.665 --> 42:24.000
You don't have your community

42:22.665 --> 42:24.000
service till Monday, right?

42:24.042 --> 42:25.543
- Yeah, but..

42:24.042 --> 42:25.543
- 'Don't pack.'

42:25.584 --> 42:27.212
We'll shop.

42:25.584 --> 42:27.212
Much more irresponsible.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.130
Um, Logan--

42:29.172 --> 42:31.883
I'll see you at the airport

42:29.172 --> 42:31.883
in 20 minutes, Ace.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.759
Okay, I'll see you

42:31.924 --> 42:33.759
in 20 minutes.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.018
(woman on TV)

42:40.099 --> 42:42.018
'I think he's gonna

42:40.099 --> 42:42.018
take me for a ride in it.'

42:42.060 --> 42:44.187
(man on TV)

42:42.060 --> 42:44.187
'What about your boyfriend?

42:42.060 --> 42:44.187
What about Jesse?'

42:44.229 --> 42:46.605
Jesse's delicious,

42:44.229 --> 42:46.605
he's gonna take me today

42:46.647 --> 42:50.902
to get a new toilet seat because

42:46.647 --> 42:50.902
mine got broken and was sliding.

42:50.943 --> 42:53.821
I thought I might fall off

42:50.943 --> 42:53.821
of it. I go, "Whoa!"

42:53.863 --> 42:57.492
It's not the same.

42:57.534 --> 43:00.578
(woman on TV)

42:57.534 --> 43:00.578
'What, am I scaring you?

42:57.534 --> 43:00.578
Want me to scare you?'

43:00.619 --> 43:02.455
- 'Boo boo boo!'

43:00.619 --> 43:02.455
- 'Beth..'

43:08.669 --> 43:10.922
