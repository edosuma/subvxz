WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.405
A MOTHER PROTECTED HER SON.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.677
HERE IN AMERICA,
WE ACTUALLY GET DIVORCED

00:06.677 --> 00:09.180
BEFORE WE GET MARRIED AGAIN.
 I WILL EXPLAIN IT ALL AWAY.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.115
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME
YOU CALLED OFF THE WEDDING.

00:14.115 --> 00:17.288
EVIL CAME TO WISTERIA LANE.
 (gasps and chokes)

00:17.288 --> 00:20.351
SUSAN, HOW IS SHE?
 WE DON'T KNOW YET.
NOBODY'S TALKING TO US.

00:20.351 --> 00:22.753
IT STRUCK AGAIN...
 (gasps and chokes)

00:22.753 --> 00:25.096
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S DEAD.
 I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HER,

00:25.096 --> 00:28.229
BUT I GUESS WE'RE SORT OF
CONNECTED NOW.
 YOU WOULD'VE LIKED HER.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.732
AND FEAR SET IN.
 WHOEVER ATTACKED JULIE
IS STILL OUT THERE.

00:31.732 --> 00:35.766
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A MADMAN
ON THE LOOSE.
 HEY!

00:35.766 --> 00:38.069
THE STAGE WAS SET...

00:38.069 --> 00:40.741
I'M A LITTLE OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.673
FOR THE KILLER...
 (tires squeal)

00:42.673 --> 00:44.515
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:44.515 --> 00:47.578
TO STRIKE AGAIN.
 (Irina screams)

00:52.323 --> 00:56.287
(Mary Alice) THERE IS A HOUSE
IN THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW.

00:56.287 --> 00:59.760
INSIDE THIS HOUSE
LIVES A MONSTER--

00:59.760 --> 01:04.135
THE KIND WHO KILLS YOUNG WOMEN.

01:04.135 --> 01:09.200
YOU MAY ASK
HOW SUCH A MONSTER CAME TO BE,

01:09.200 --> 01:13.544
AND THAT'S
A VERY GOOD QUESTION, INDEED.

01:13.544 --> 01:17.208
I'M OUT OF SCOTCH.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.550
I'LL BUY YOU SOME MORE
WHILE I'M OUT.

01:19.550 --> 01:22.553
YOU GOT ANY IN YOUR ROOM?

01:22.553 --> 01:25.156
NO. AND STAY OUT OF THERE.

01:25.156 --> 01:27.488
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
STEALING MY BOOZE.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.491
MOM, STOP BEING SO PARANOID.
I DON'T EVEN DRINK.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.124
(sets bottle down)
 SURE YOU DON'T.

01:33.124 --> 01:35.696
I GOTTA HELP MRS. SCAVO
FIX HER CAR.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.270
YOU CAN WAIT A LITTLE WHILE,
RIGHT?

01:43.734 --> 01:47.107
(dog barking in distance)

01:47.107 --> 01:50.211
HIS NAME WAS EDDIE.

01:51.782 --> 01:55.386
EVERYONE THOUGHT
HE WAS HARMLESS...

01:55.386 --> 01:56.617
(sighs)

01:57.888 --> 02:03.454
UNTIL THE DAY HIS MOTHER
WENT INTO HIS ROOM.

02:03.454 --> 02:08.699
SHE WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH...

02:12.132 --> 02:16.467
BUT FOUND THE TRUTH INSTEAD.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.414
SOON EVERYONE IN TOWN
WOULD BE ASKING,

02:23.414 --> 02:26.747
"HOW COULD SUCH A MONSTER
COME TO BE?"

02:29.380 --> 02:33.554
SADLY, THE ANSWER...

02:33.554 --> 02:47.398
WOULD SATISFY NO ONE.

02:47.398 --> 02:49.900
I MET EDDIE ON A MONDAY.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.876
HE HAD JUST TURNED 4.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.509
(panting)

02:58.509 --> 03:01.212
IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'LL TAKE UP JOGGING NOW.

03:01.212 --> 03:03.784
DON'T WAIT TILL YOU'RE MY AGE.
IT'S TOO LATE.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.916
(woman) I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!
 (man) AT THIS POINT,
I'D SETTLE FOR ANYTHING.

03:05.916 --> 03:09.260
DO THE DISHES. WIPE DOWN
THE COUNTER. YOU'VE GIVEN UP!

03:09.260 --> 03:12.363
(woman) I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.
 SO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

03:12.363 --> 03:15.726
(door opens)
 (man) YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
NEED THIS CRAP. I AM DONE!

03:15.726 --> 03:19.630
BABY, I SAID I WAS SORRY!
 IT'S TOO LATE, BARBARA.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

03:19.630 --> 03:22.903
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST WALK OUT.
WE HAVE A KID!
 NO, YOU HAVE A KID.
I NEVER WANTED HIM.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.607
I NEVER WANTED ANY OF THIS!
 EXCUSE ME!

03:26.607 --> 03:28.939
IS THIS YOUR CHILD?

03:28.939 --> 03:31.882
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
 WELL, I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT

03:31.882 --> 03:34.945
TO BE TALKING LIKE THIS
IN FRONT OF HIM.

03:38.949 --> 03:40.451
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.222
HANK, DON'T DO THIS!

03:42.222 --> 03:43.954
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.797
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.
 (car door shuts, engine starts)

03:46.797 --> 03:48.259
(tires peal)

03:48.259 --> 03:50.531
(crying)

03:58.509 --> 04:00.010
EDDIE, COME HERE.

04:00.010 --> 04:03.374
(sniffles) COME HERE.
I HAVE TO GET READY FOR WORK.

04:04.475 --> 04:07.548
(doorbell rings)

04:09.450 --> 04:11.822
OH, IT'S YOU.

04:11.822 --> 04:12.953
HI.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.955
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN,

04:14.955 --> 04:16.957
SEE HOW YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.659
(clears throat)

04:18.659 --> 04:20.930
ALSO, I-I MADE YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.633
YOU'RE KIDDING.

04:22.633 --> 04:25.866
WELL, IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL,
JUST MACARONI AND CHEESE.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.698
(lid clanks)

04:27.698 --> 04:30.971
COME ON.
LET ME HEAT THIS UP FOR YOU.

04:32.903 --> 04:34.405
I DON'T KNOW.

04:34.405 --> 04:36.407
AND THEN WE CAN TALK.

04:36.407 --> 04:38.909
AND IF YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND,

04:38.909 --> 04:41.482
I PROMISE,
I WON'T DEFEND HIM.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.415
DON'T JUST STAND THERE, THEN.
(chuckles)

04:44.415 --> 04:45.956
COME ON IN.

04:47.758 --> 04:51.392
(TV playing indistinctly)

04:51.392 --> 04:53.524
HE'S A HANDSOME LITTLE BOY.

04:53.524 --> 04:56.527
LOOKS JUST LIKE HIS FATHER...
 MM.

04:56.527 --> 04:57.898
WHICH IS A SHAME.

05:00.331 --> 05:02.032
MAYBE HANK WILL RECONSIDER.

05:02.032 --> 05:05.576
NO. HE'S SERIOUS THIS TIME.

05:05.576 --> 05:08.078
I'M ALL ALONE
WITH A 4-YEAR-OLD TO RAISE.

05:08.078 --> 05:10.611
ISN'T THERE ANYBODY
WHO CAN HELP YOU?

05:10.611 --> 05:12.082
FAMILY, YOUR MOTHER?

05:12.082 --> 05:13.884
OH, MY MOTHER. (chuckles)

05:13.884 --> 05:15.386
GOD FORBID.

05:15.386 --> 05:16.987
WHAT ABOUT FRIENDS?

05:16.987 --> 05:19.490
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A GREAT GROUP OF FRIENDS

05:19.490 --> 05:20.991
OVER ON WISTERIA LANE.

05:20.991 --> 05:23.954
WE'VE HELPED EACH OTHER GET
THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS.

05:23.954 --> 05:25.956
YEAH, I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN

05:25.956 --> 05:27.958
THE TYPE OF WOMAN
TO HAVE GIRLFRIENDS.

05:27.958 --> 05:31.101
AND NOW I'M 35 YEARS OLD
WITH A KID.

05:31.101 --> 05:33.333
I'M GUESSING
I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO BE

05:33.333 --> 05:35.335
HAVING ANY BOYFRIENDS EITHER.
(chuckles)

05:35.335 --> 05:36.837
OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.370
WOMEN IN YOUR SITUATION
FIND LOVE.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.972
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT.

05:41.972 --> 05:44.815
I GUESS.
 WELL, I'VE GOTTA GO.

05:44.815 --> 05:46.877
(keys jangle)

05:46.877 --> 05:49.950
UM, IF YOU LIKE,
I CAN STOP BY NEXT WEEK.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.953
UH, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THAT. WE'LL BE FINE.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.955
UH, EDDIE,
SAY GOOD-BYE TO MARY ALICE.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.927
GOOD-BYE.

05:56.927 --> 05:58.088
YOU TAKE CARE, EDDIE.

05:58.088 --> 05:59.790
OH, SO CUTE.

05:59.790 --> 06:00.991
(chuckles)

06:00.991 --> 06:04.565
HE'S GONNA BE A HEARTBREAKER
ONE DAY.

06:04.565 --> 06:08.499
JUST LIKE HIS FATHER.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.473
(crickets chirping)

06:12.473 --> 06:14.975
(doorbell rings)

06:20.881 --> 06:22.683
OH, HI, EDDIE.

06:22.683 --> 06:27.087
REMEMBER ME? I-I BROUGHT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.491
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
OPEN THE DOOR.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.494
WELL, TELL YOUR MOM I'M HERE,
AND SHE CAN OPEN IT.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.426
SHE'S NOT HERE.

06:35.426 --> 06:37.998
OH, WELL,
TELL YOUR BABYSITTER THEN.

06:40.170 --> 06:43.704
Y-YOU DO HAVE A SITTER,
DON'T YOU?

06:45.035 --> 06:50.140
EDDIE, WHERE EXACTLY IS
YOUR MOTHER?

06:50.140 --> 06:53.914
(Sheryl Crow) ♪ ALL I WANNA DO
IS HAVE SOME FUN ♪

06:53.914 --> 06:55.185
(laughs)

06:55.185 --> 06:58.689
♪ I GOT A FEELING
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE ♪

06:58.689 --> 07:01.091
OH, MY GOSH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:01.091 --> 07:05.425
LOOK,
IT'S MY FRIEND, MARY ALICE.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.057
WELL,
NICE TO MEET YOU, MARY.

07:07.057 --> 07:09.900
THE NAME'S RON.
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

07:09.900 --> 07:12.062
THANKS, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA BE HERE THAT LONG.

07:12.062 --> 07:14.835
GET UP. YOU'RE LEAVING.
 WHOA! (laughs)

07:14.835 --> 07:17.608
SHE CAN'T LEAVE YET. NO, THIS
PARTY'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

07:17.608 --> 07:20.070
(laughs)
 DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS RON?

07:20.070 --> 07:24.074
YEAH.
 SHUT UP, RON.
I HAVE EDDIE IN MY CAR.

07:24.074 --> 07:26.577
EDDIE? HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?
HE'S NOT HURT, IS HE?

07:26.577 --> 07:30.150
NO, HE'S FINE,
NO THANKS TO YOU.
 WHO'S EDDIE?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.153
HER 4-YEAR-OLD CHILD WHO SHE
LEFT AT HER HOME, UNATTENDED.
 YOU GOT A KID?

07:33.153 --> 07:36.126
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LEAD WITH THAT NEXT TIME,

07:36.126 --> 07:38.088
BEFORE I SPRING
FOR THE SCREWDRIVERS.

07:38.088 --> 07:39.960
OH, BABY.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.063
DON'T, UH, DON'T YOU WANT
TO GET MY PHONE NUMBER?

07:43.063 --> 07:46.136
NOW LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

07:46.136 --> 07:48.138
I AM THIS CLOSE
TO CALLING SOCIAL SERVICES.

07:48.138 --> 07:50.641
YOU MIGHT WANNA CHANGE
YOUR TONE. LET'S GO.
 (keys jangle)

07:50.641 --> 07:54.575
(sets glass down)
 YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BOY
TO LOOK AFTER.

07:56.907 --> 07:59.009
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE
STAYED HOME.

07:59.009 --> 08:01.512
BUT I WAS ALREADY DRESSED
WHEN THE SITTER CANCELED,

08:01.512 --> 08:04.555
AND I REALLY JUST NEEDED
A COUPLE OF HOURS TO MYSELF.

08:04.555 --> 08:08.018
HE'S 4 YEARS OLD, BARBARA.
WHAT IF HE HAD GOTTEN SICK?

08:08.018 --> 08:11.592
WHAT IF HE HAD HURT HIMSELF?
 I KNOW. I KNOW.
IT WAS REALLY STUPID.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.594
YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE ME

08:13.594 --> 08:15.926
YOU WILL NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.

08:15.926 --> 08:18.098
NEVER AGAIN. I SWEAR.

08:19.169 --> 08:22.072
IT'S JUST...

08:22.072 --> 08:24.535
WHAT?

08:26.737 --> 08:29.109
I REALLY NEED A MAN.

08:31.982 --> 08:33.984
(inhales deeply)
OH, MY HEAVENS.

08:33.984 --> 08:36.046
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOME
HOURS AGO.

08:36.046 --> 08:38.048
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US.
WE ARE GOOD NOW.

08:40.049 --> 08:43.023
(keys jangle)

08:43.023 --> 08:46.727
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY,
BARBARA. I DO.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.929
IT'S JUST...

08:48.929 --> 08:50.260
BEING A MOTHER MEANS

08:50.260 --> 08:53.003
ALWAYS PUTTING HIS NEEDS
AHEAD OF YOURS.

08:54.905 --> 08:56.236
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.610
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS.
(chuckles)

09:04.575 --> 09:06.116
BABY...
 (door opens)

09:06.116 --> 09:08.318
(door closes)
 COME HERE.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.222
OH, EDDIE.

09:14.084 --> 09:18.689
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU RUINED MY LIFE.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.672
GABRIELLE MET EDDIE
ON A TUESDAY,

09:31.672 --> 09:34.274
THE DAY SHE MOVED
INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.977
CARLOS, I'M BORED.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.979
NO, I CAN'T GO GET
MY NAILS DONE,

09:38.979 --> 09:40.981
BECAUSE I'M WAITING
FOR THE FREAKING MOVERS!

09:40.981 --> 09:43.583
BESIDES, I DOUBT THIS TOWN
EVEN HAS A SPA.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.585
IT DOES, HOWEVER,
HAVE ANNOYING PEOPLE

09:45.585 --> 09:47.918
WHO COME TO YOUR HOUSE
WITH WELCOME BASKETS

09:47.918 --> 09:51.121
AND SAY THINGS LIKE,
"HOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?" (scoffs)

09:51.121 --> 09:54.124
NO, NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE NOT
 GOING INTO ANOTHER MEETING!

09:54.124 --> 09:57.127
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
I MOVED HERE FOR YOUR JOB,

09:57.127 --> 09:58.829
DOESN'T MEAN YOU...

09:58.829 --> 10:01.832
OH, YEAH. DAMN RIGHT WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS TONIGHT,

10:01.832 --> 10:04.134
AND IT WILL BE HOT ENOUGH
FOR YOU.
 (beep)

10:04.134 --> 10:07.938
(sighs and groans)

10:07.938 --> 10:11.241
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, CHANEL.

10:15.846 --> 10:18.849
(clattering in distance)

10:28.398 --> 10:31.231
OH! GOD.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

10:31.231 --> 10:34.134
EDDIE.
 HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.667
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
HOW DID YOU GET IN?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.809
WITH MY KEY.
I OWN THIS PLACE.

10:38.809 --> 10:41.772
WELL, I'VE BEEN PLAYING HERE
SINCE THE OTHER PEOPLE MOVED.

10:41.772 --> 10:43.774
CAN I STILL DO THAT?

10:43.774 --> 10:47.417
NO! GET OUT. GO. GO HOME.
SHOO! SHOO, SHOO, SHOO!

10:49.419 --> 10:52.082
DID YOU KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY BEAUTIFUL?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.432
OKAY, MAYBE I WAS
A LITTLE RUDE EARLIER.

11:02.432 --> 11:05.435
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
WHAT DO YOU DO?
 I'M A KID.

11:05.435 --> 11:09.199
OH. RIGHT.
SO WHY AREN'T YOU IN SCHOOL?
 IT'S SUMMER.

11:09.199 --> 11:12.943
OH. RIGHT. WELL, I DON'T
REALLY DO THE KID THING.

11:12.943 --> 11:14.945
SO WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

11:14.945 --> 11:17.147
A COUPLE OF STREETS OVER.

11:17.147 --> 11:18.879
THE HOUSE WITH THE WEEDS.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.051
(truck horn honks in distance)

11:21.051 --> 11:23.053
WELL, THAT'S THE MOVING VAN

11:23.053 --> 11:26.056
THAT HAS A LOT OF BOXES
I HAVE TO UNPACK.

11:26.056 --> 11:28.688
YOU BETTER HIT THE ROAD.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.892
OR I COULD STAY HERE
AND HELP YOU UNPACK.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.898
FOLLOW ME.

11:39.229 --> 11:41.231
MMM.

11:41.231 --> 11:43.874
MM! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

11:43.874 --> 11:45.175
OH, SORRY.

11:45.175 --> 11:47.978
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
YOU DO GOOD WORK.

11:47.978 --> 11:50.811
MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE
READY TO DO A FRENCH TIP.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.744
(doorbell rings)
 SHOULD I GET THAT?

11:53.744 --> 11:55.746
(lowers voice) NO. SHH.
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

11:55.746 --> 11:57.748
IT MIGHT BE
ONE OF THOSE STEPFORD WIVES

11:57.748 --> 11:59.750
WITH ANOTHER "WELCOME TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD" CAKE.

11:59.750 --> 12:03.193
I MEAN, REALLY, DOES IT
LOOK LIKE I EAT CAKE?
 SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS
ARE NICE.

12:03.193 --> 12:06.857
THAT LADY WITH THE RED HAIR
MAKES HER OWN HALLOWEEN CANDY.

12:06.857 --> 12:09.860
YOU MEAN THE ONE WHOSE PARENTS
NAMED HER AFTER CHEESE?

12:09.860 --> 12:12.963
NO, THANK YOU. I LIKE MY ROBOTS
A LITTLE MORE LIFELIKE.

12:12.963 --> 12:14.965
(sighs)
THOUGH SHE'S NOT AS BAD

12:14.965 --> 12:17.968
AS THAT BLONDE CHICK WHO'S
ALWAYS YELLING AT HER KIDS.

12:17.968 --> 12:20.971
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON FIRE
WHO ARE NOT AS LOUD AS SHE IS.

12:20.971 --> 12:23.173
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
MAYBE FOR A SECOND,

12:23.173 --> 12:26.076
THAT SUSAN MAYER LADY
AND I COULD FRIENDS.

12:26.076 --> 12:29.349
AND THEN SHE STARTED TALKING.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.182
OKAY, GOOD.
I THINK THEY'RE GONE.

12:32.182 --> 12:35.155
CAN WE WATCH OUR SHOWS NOW?

12:35.155 --> 12:37.157
(normal voice)
JUST AS SOON AS YOU FINISH

12:37.157 --> 12:40.831
UNPACKING THOSE BOXES
IN THE KITCHEN.
 I DID IT THIS MORNING.

12:40.831 --> 12:43.934
OH, MY GOD. IF YOU CAN SEW,
I AM LOCKING YOU IN MY BASEMENT,

12:43.934 --> 12:45.996
AND YOU ARE STAYING HERE
FOREVER.

12:45.996 --> 12:47.537
COOL!

12:47.537 --> 12:49.239
EDDIE, I WAS KIDDING.

12:49.239 --> 12:51.501
YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE
EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK.

12:51.501 --> 12:54.404
DOESN'T YOUR MOTHER MIND?
 NO.

12:54.404 --> 12:56.947
ARE YOU SURE?
MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HER.

12:56.947 --> 12:58.949
NO. UH,
SHE HAS THIS NEW BOYFRIEND,

12:58.949 --> 13:01.852
AND THEY LIKE
THEIR ALONE TIME.

13:01.852 --> 13:03.183
OH.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.386
OKAY. WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
STAY FOR DINNER? I'LL COOK.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.890
GREAT!
 ALTHOUGH, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO
UNPACKED THE POTS AND PANS,

13:09.890 --> 13:12.222
SO I'D HATE TO MESS UP
YOUR SYSTEM.

13:12.222 --> 13:14.895
I'LL COOK.
I CAN HEAT UP SOUP.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.127
MORE THAN I CAN DO.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.472
OKAY, YAO LIN,
HOW SICK ARE YOU, REALLY?

13:22.472 --> 13:25.475
IF YOU CAN DIAL A PHONE,
YOU CAN COME IN

13:25.475 --> 13:28.478
AND DO THREE LOADS OF LAUNDRY
AND WASH SOME DISHES.

13:28.478 --> 13:31.181
(raises voice) W--YAO LIN,
YOU KNOW I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

13:31.181 --> 13:34.915
WHEN YOU SPEAK
IN YOUR NATIVE GIBBERISH!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.546
(normal voice) HELLO?

13:36.546 --> 13:37.918
HELLO?

13:39.289 --> 13:41.121
SURPRISE, BABE.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.954
HONEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

13:43.954 --> 13:46.256
WELL, I WAS AT WORK
AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT

13:46.256 --> 13:48.028
MY LONELY...

13:48.028 --> 13:49.159
BEAUTIFUL WIFE. (kisses)

13:49.159 --> 13:50.901
AW!

13:50.901 --> 13:53.063
AND THAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BATHTUB
UPSTAIRS

13:53.063 --> 13:56.136
WE HAVEN'T CHRISTENED YET.
 (gasps) YOU PIG.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.609
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T
WANT TO TAKE A BATH WITH ME?

13:59.609 --> 14:02.242
WELL,
I GUESS THE PANS CAN WAIT

14:02.242 --> 14:05.845
UNTIL YAO LIN RECOVERS
FROM HER DOUBLE PNEUMONIA.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.350
(giggles) ALL RIGHT.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.222
WE'VE DONE THE TUB.

14:12.222 --> 14:15.585
MAYBE WE SHOULD CHRISTEN
THE GUEST ROOM NEXT.

14:15.585 --> 14:18.858
MM, THAT SOUNDS GREAT,
BUT I NEED TO GET GOING.
 WAIT A MINUTE.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.131
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WORK?
THIS IS A NOONER?

14:21.131 --> 14:23.133
I CAN'T TAKE
THE WHOLE DAY OFF.

14:23.133 --> 14:26.997
I ALREADY CANCELED TWO MEETINGS
AND A LUNCH FOR THIS.
 SO HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

14:26.997 --> 14:28.298
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

14:28.298 --> 14:30.971
WELL, DON'T JUST SIT THERE.
FONDLE SOMETHING.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.143
(chuckles)

14:33.143 --> 14:36.006
WHAT THE HELL? WHO ARE YOU?
 AAH!

14:36.006 --> 14:37.247
EDDIE!

14:37.247 --> 14:38.608
YOU KNOW THIS KID?

14:38.608 --> 14:41.111
HE LIVES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:41.111 --> 14:44.254
I KNOCKED. NO ONE ANSWERED.
SO I CAME THROUGH THE WINDOW.

14:44.254 --> 14:46.656
WE'RE NAKED. GET OUT!

14:46.656 --> 14:49.289
SHE TOLD ME I COULD COME OVER.
WHO'S THIS GUY?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.192
HE'S MY HUSBAND, EDDIE!
GET OUT!

14:55.125 --> 14:58.528
THIS IS HOW YOU'VE BEEN
SPENDING YOUR DAYS? (sighs)

14:58.528 --> 15:00.370
HE'S LONELY. I'M LONELY.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.372
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WOMEN
ON THIS STREET

15:02.372 --> 15:06.236
THAT YOU CAN BE FRIENDS WITH.
 WELL, THEY'RE ALL SO WEIRD.

15:06.236 --> 15:09.609
GABY, YOUR BEST FRIEND IS
A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY. THAT'S WEIRD.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.612
HE HAS NO ONE IN HIS LIFE.
HIS MOTHER TOTALLY IGNORES HIM.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.315
I'M THINKING OF GOING OVER THERE
AND SAYING SOMETHING.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.318
NO. STAY OUT OF IT.
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE NOW,

15:18.318 --> 15:21.421
AND I DON'T WANT US TO BE KNOWN
AS THE NOSY NEIGHBORS.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.258
BUT HE'S SO SAD.
 I DON'T CARE.

15:28.258 --> 15:30.260
STOP USING HIM AS YOUR EXCUSE.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.262
CUT HIM LOOSE
AND GET OUT THERE

15:32.262 --> 15:34.404
AND START MAKING A LIFE
FOR YOURSELF.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.608
(door closes)

15:43.313 --> 15:45.115
BUDDY?

15:48.348 --> 15:53.253
LOOK, EDDIE, I'M SORRY
CARLOS YELLED AT YOU.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.156
IT'S JUST--
WE WERE CLEANING THE TUB.

15:56.156 --> 16:00.260
I KNOW WHAT SEX IS.
I'M NOT STUPID.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.363
NO, YOU'RE NOT,
WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD KNOW

16:03.363 --> 16:06.236
YOU CAN'T JUST BREAK
INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

16:06.236 --> 16:09.699
IT WAS OKAY WHEN I WAS
UNPACKING YOUR BOXES.

16:09.699 --> 16:12.642
LOOK, EDDIE,
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

16:12.642 --> 16:15.305
BUT THE THING IS,

16:15.305 --> 16:17.677
WE CAN'T HANG OUT SO MUCH
ANYMORE.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.310
I NEED TO MAKE FRIENDS
MY AGE,

16:20.310 --> 16:23.353
AND YOU NEED TO MAKE FRIENDS
YOUR AGE.

16:23.353 --> 16:26.286
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT SO PRETTY.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.987
(gasps)

16:27.987 --> 16:30.060
EDDIE!

16:30.060 --> 16:34.264
(both moaning)

16:37.467 --> 16:40.470
(door closes)
 (moans and giggles)

16:43.303 --> 16:45.075
(both laughing)

16:56.646 --> 16:59.649
(birds chirping)

17:01.121 --> 17:02.622
(thud)

17:02.622 --> 17:06.226
(chirping loudly)

17:11.131 --> 17:13.333
(gunshot)

17:22.311 --> 17:25.214
BREE HIRED EDDIE
TO HELP OUT ON A WEDNESDAY,

17:25.214 --> 17:28.748
AND SHE HELPED HIM IN RETURN.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.751
IT'S LOOKING WONDERFUL,
EDDIE.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.823
SAME TIME TOMORROW?

17:33.823 --> 17:38.228
SURE, MRS. HODGE.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.130
UM...

17:40.130 --> 17:42.292
I THINK
YOU GAVE ME TOO MUCH.

17:42.292 --> 17:44.564
CALL IT A BONUS
FOR A JOB WELL DONE.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.568
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS.
 WELL, I'M SURE YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE EXTRA CASH.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.570
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.273
MAYBE YOU COULD, UH,
BUY HER SOMETHING NICE.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.275
UH, I DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.347
OH.

17:57.347 --> 17:58.678
WELL...

17:58.678 --> 18:00.580
YOU'RE STILL YOUNG.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.283
WELL, IT WOULDN'T MATTER
HOW OLD I AM.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.655
GIRLS NEVER NOTICE ME.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.657
WELL,
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

18:07.657 --> 18:11.391
THAT THEY MIGHT BE WAITING
FOR YOU TO NOTICE THEM?

18:11.391 --> 18:13.363
UM... NO.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.698
ARE THERE ANY GIRLS
THAT YOU LIKE?

18:18.698 --> 18:22.332
THERE IS THIS ONE GIRL
AT SCHOOL.

18:22.332 --> 18:25.335
DO YOU EVER TALK TO HER?

18:25.335 --> 18:28.378
SEE? SHE HAS PROBABLY
NOTICED YOU LOTS OF TIMES

18:28.378 --> 18:31.311
AND WONDERS WHY YOU DON'T
WALK UP TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.313
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.216
DOES SHE HAVE NICE EYES?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.318
SHE HAS NICE EVERYTHING.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.621
(chuckles) WELL, YOU CAN START
BY MENTIONING HER EYES.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.355
TRUST ME. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG
WITH A GENUINE COMPLIMENT.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.357
THIS IS GOOD STUFF.
 MM-HMM.

18:47.357 --> 18:49.359
ANYTHING ELSE?

18:49.359 --> 18:52.202
WELL, ONCE YOU HAVE HER
ATTENTION, YOU'VE GOTTA WOO HER.

18:52.202 --> 18:53.233
WOO?

18:53.233 --> 18:55.235
YES. GIVE HER A LITTLE GIFT

18:55.235 --> 18:57.737
SO SHE KNOWS THAT
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HER.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.239
FLOWERS ARE NICE.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.311
ROSES ARE EVEN BETTER.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.273
AND THEN EVENTUALLY,

19:03.273 --> 19:05.815
YOU CAN WORK YOUR WAY UP
TO JEWELRY.

19:05.815 --> 19:08.478
I CAN'T AFFORD ALL THAT.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.652
NOW YOU CAN.

19:23.393 --> 19:24.534
EXCUSE ME.

19:24.534 --> 19:26.896
UM, ARE YOU
EDDIE ORLOFSKY'S MOTHER?

19:26.896 --> 19:29.469
WHO'S ASKING?
 BREE HODGE.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.171
YOUR SON HAS BEEN DOING
SOME PAINTING FOR ME

19:32.171 --> 19:34.374
OVER ON WISTERIA LANE.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.307
YOU'RE NOT THE WOMAN WHO HAS SEX
WITH HER GARDENERS, ARE YOU?

19:37.307 --> 19:39.909
OH, GOOD HEAVENS, NO.
THAT'S...

19:39.909 --> 19:41.411
SOMEBODY ELSE.

19:41.411 --> 19:44.714
UM, MAY I PLEASE SPEAK
TO EDDIE?

19:44.714 --> 19:46.916
UH, HE'S NOT HERE.
 (thud)

19:46.916 --> 19:49.589
OH. UH, WELL, THEN, UM,

19:49.589 --> 19:52.292
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.894
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

19:54.894 --> 19:58.498
I GAVE EDDIE SOME ADVICE
ON HOW TO TALK TO GIRLS.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.771
OH, I'M GLAD SOMEONE DID.
THE KID IS A LUMMOX.

20:01.771 --> 20:04.604
UH, YES. UH, WELL...

20:04.604 --> 20:08.338
WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT
THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION

20:08.338 --> 20:09.939
IS MY DAUGHTER DANIELLE.

20:09.939 --> 20:12.282
HE GAVE HER ROSES
AND THEN MORE ROSES,

20:12.282 --> 20:16.716
AND THEN I FOUND THIS
IN MY MAILBOX.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.918
(scoffs)

20:18.918 --> 20:21.721
OH, BIG SPENDER. (chuckles)

20:21.721 --> 20:23.993
JUST LIKE HIS DAD.

20:23.993 --> 20:26.356
IT WAS A LOVELY GESTURE.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.332
SADLY, DANIELLE
DOESN'T RETURN HIS FEELINGS.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.335
SHE SPENDS MOST OF HER TIME
WITH THE OTHER CHEERLEADERS--

20:35.335 --> 20:37.467
SAY NO MORE.
SHE'S OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

20:37.467 --> 20:40.340
NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.313
SO WHAT,
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HIM?

20:43.313 --> 20:44.744
UH, YES.

20:44.744 --> 20:48.718
UH, IF YOU COULD JUST SAY
SOMETHING TO LET HIM DOWN EASY.

20:48.718 --> 20:51.020
YOU GOT IT.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.984
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:54.984 --> 20:58.358
(door closes)
 THIS LADY SAYS YOU'VE BEEN
STALKING HER DAUGHTER.

20:58.358 --> 21:02.692
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
 YOU JUST SAID HE IS HARASSING
SOME GIRL HE HAS NO CHANCE WITH.

21:02.692 --> 21:05.965
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
DO YOU CALL THAT?

21:05.965 --> 21:09.439
I WAS TRYING TO WOO HER.

21:09.439 --> 21:11.841
(laughing)

21:11.841 --> 21:14.374
WOO HER?

21:14.374 --> 21:16.706
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HYSTERICAL.

21:16.706 --> 21:18.848
THERE'S NO NEED TO MOCK HIM.

21:18.848 --> 21:21.010
OH, WHO IS MOCKING?
I AM THRILLED.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.983
I ALWAYS FIGURED
THE ONLY GIRL HE'D END UP WITH

21:23.983 --> 21:25.985
WOULD BE BLIND, DEAF
OR INFLATABLE.

21:27.487 --> 21:31.491
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW HOW GOOD
HE IS AT WOOING...

21:31.491 --> 21:32.662
(laughs)

21:32.662 --> 21:34.894
PLEASE DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.966
I'LL DO WHAT I WANT, ROMEO.

21:36.966 --> 21:38.798
AND DON'T WORRY.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.701
I'LL MAKE SURE HE STOPS
HASSLING YOUR DAUGHTER.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.942
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

22:02.552 --> 22:03.893
HELLO, EDDIE.

22:03.893 --> 22:06.826
IT'S BEEN A FEW DAYS.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.329
I WASN'T, UH, SURE
IF I'D BE SEEING YOU AGAIN.

22:11.661 --> 22:14.964
I DIDN'T WANNA COME BACK,
BUT I NEEDED THE MONEY.

22:14.964 --> 22:17.667
NO, I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING ANGRY.

22:17.667 --> 22:21.010
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

22:21.010 --> 22:23.342
OH, EDDIE,
I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME

22:23.342 --> 22:25.845
THAT DANIELLE WAS THE GIRL
YOU WERE INTERESTED IN.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.847
OH, YEAH, RIGHT. THEN--
THEN YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME

22:27.847 --> 22:31.350
THAT SHE WAS OUT OF MY LEAGUE
AND SAVED MY MOM THE TROUBLE.
 I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.853
AND I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T
HAVE LAUGHED AT YOU.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.026
WHY NOT? (laughs)
IT'S--IT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

22:37.026 --> 22:40.430
NERDY FREAK WANTS TO DATE
POPULAR CHEERLEADER?

22:40.430 --> 22:43.393
THE ONLY THING I SEE WHEN I LOOK
AT YOU IS A NICE YOUNG MAN

22:43.393 --> 22:45.935
WHO ISN'T TREATED
AS WELL AS HE SHOULD BE.

22:45.935 --> 22:49.038
YEAH, WELL, TELL DANIELLE
SHE CAN RELAX.

22:49.038 --> 22:52.141
I, UH, I WON'T BE TALKING TO HER
ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN FORBIDDEN.

22:52.141 --> 22:55.445
OH, EDDIE, DANIELLE WOULD
BE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU,

22:55.445 --> 22:57.647
AS A FRIEND.

22:57.647 --> 23:01.951
(crying) I DON'T WANT A FRIEND.
I WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE ME.

23:04.614 --> 23:07.156
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.

23:08.818 --> 23:11.120
I THINK I, UH,

23:11.120 --> 23:13.092
I WANNA WORK NOW.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.565
(sniffles)

23:20.430 --> 23:24.804
EDDIE, THERE IS SOMEONE
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.106
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE
PATIENT.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.779
FOR HOW LONG?

23:29.779 --> 23:31.781
I FEEL LIKE I'M WAITING

23:31.781 --> 23:34.784
FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S NEVER GONNA SHOW UP.

23:34.784 --> 23:38.417
THERE ARE GIRLS OUT THERE
WHO WILL SAY "YES" TO YOU.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.419
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THEM.

23:44.454 --> 23:48.127
(siren wailing in distance)
 YES. IT'S HALF UP FRONT
AND HALF AFTER.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.760
(bills crinkle,
dog barking in distance)

23:50.760 --> 23:53.463
SO WHERE DO WE GO?

23:53.463 --> 23:55.064
DOWN THERE.

23:55.064 --> 23:56.566
OH.

23:56.566 --> 23:59.168
(horns honking in distance)
 DON'T WORRY, CUTIE.

23:59.168 --> 24:01.440
NO ONE'S GONNA SEE US.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.174
YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.551
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

24:13.222 --> 24:15.855
I FORGOT SOMETHING.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.227
I GOT YOU THESE.

24:20.089 --> 24:23.092
(laughing)

24:25.535 --> 24:28.097
WOW. I JUST...

24:28.097 --> 24:29.839
(laughs)

24:29.839 --> 24:31.841
PLEASE DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

24:31.841 --> 24:33.703
I'M SORRY.

24:33.703 --> 24:37.076
I'M SORRY. (laughs)

24:37.076 --> 24:38.848
LET'S JUST GO.

24:38.848 --> 24:41.851
(laughing)

24:48.257 --> 24:51.821
(dog barking in distance)

24:51.821 --> 24:55.224
(panting)

25:07.937 --> 25:10.279
(door bells jingle)

25:10.279 --> 25:13.042
SUSAN FIRST NOTICED EDDIE

25:13.042 --> 25:16.045
AS THE BOY WHO SOLD HER COFFEE.

25:16.045 --> 25:18.187
THEN ONE THURSDAY,

25:18.187 --> 25:20.550
SHE NOTICED SOMETHING MORE.

25:20.550 --> 25:22.251
WOW. THAT'S AMAZING.

25:22.251 --> 25:25.154
OH, HEY.
 I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE AN ARTIST.

25:25.154 --> 25:27.156
OH, I WAS JUST--
I'M FOOLING AROUND.

25:27.156 --> 25:29.158
UH, WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

25:29.158 --> 25:31.631
NO, LET ME SEE IT.

25:34.063 --> 25:37.837
(man) OH, THOSE ARE GREAT.
 IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU ALL WOULD LIKE?

25:37.837 --> 25:40.539
WOW. LOOK AT THE SHADOWING
AND THE BLENDING.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.572
IT'S... IT'S REALLY GOOD.

25:42.572 --> 25:44.574
MY MOM THINKS
I'M WASTING MY TIME.

25:44.574 --> 25:47.216
SHE SAYS THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE
WAY BETTER THAN ME.

25:47.216 --> 25:49.218
WELL, YOU TELL YOUR MOM

25:49.218 --> 25:51.280
THAT I HAVE AN EXPENSIVE,
WORTHLESS ART DEGREE

25:51.280 --> 25:53.282
THAT SAYS I KNOW
WHAT I'M TAKING ABOUT,

25:53.282 --> 25:55.925
AND YOU HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL.

25:55.925 --> 25:58.958
YOU THINK?
 YEAH. YOU JUST NEED
TO WORK ON YOUR TECHNIQUE.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.030
I COULD HELP IF YOU WANT.

26:01.030 --> 26:02.762
SERIOUSLY?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.295
THAT'D BE GREAT. THANKS.

26:06.295 --> 26:07.667
(chuckles)

26:07.667 --> 26:10.569
(chuckles) OKAY, WHATEVER
YOU WANT--ON THE HOUSE.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.642
OH. UM,

26:12.642 --> 26:16.806
I'LL HAVE
A LARGE, TRIPLE-SHOT LATTE.

26:16.806 --> 26:18.848
THAT'S FUNNY. YOUR HUSBAND
WAS IN HERE EARLIER,

26:18.848 --> 26:21.110
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE ORDERED.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.852
ACTUALLY, HE'S...

26:22.852 --> 26:24.213
NOW MY EX-HUSBAND.

26:26.656 --> 26:29.619
OH. I'M--I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

26:29.619 --> 26:32.221
NO, NO. IT'S FINE.
WE'VE ALL MOVED ON.

26:32.221 --> 26:35.224
(espresso machine whirring)
 MIKE'S DATING THE WOMAN THAT
LIVES ACROSS THE STREET NOW,

26:35.224 --> 26:38.267
AND I'M, UH...

26:38.267 --> 26:42.001
ADDING A DOUBLE CHOCOLATE
BROWNIE TO MY ORDER.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.373
WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY.

26:44.373 --> 26:46.776
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

26:46.776 --> 26:49.378
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE TO DATE YOU.

26:49.378 --> 26:52.111
YOU HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL, TOO.
(chuckles)

26:53.612 --> 26:55.284
(whispers) BROWNIE.

26:55.284 --> 26:57.817
RIGHT.

26:59.649 --> 27:03.122
EDDIE, THE DETAIL IS AMAZING.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.094
YOUR USE OF PERSPECTIVE....

27:05.094 --> 27:09.028
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE COME
SO FAR IN JUST A FEW WEEKS.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.299
WELL...

27:10.299 --> 27:12.301
I HAD A REALLY GOOD TEACHER.

27:12.301 --> 27:14.303
(chuckles) THAT'S SWEET.

27:14.303 --> 27:18.067
BUT ACTUALLY, I THINK
THAT YOU'VE OUTGROWN ME,

27:18.067 --> 27:20.109
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

27:20.109 --> 27:22.772
WHAT?

27:22.772 --> 27:24.714
I SIGNED YOU UP

27:24.714 --> 27:29.118
FOR A 2-WEEK SEMINAR
AT THE ART INSTITUTE.

27:29.118 --> 27:31.420
AND BEFORE YOU SAY
YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT,

27:31.420 --> 27:34.724
I ALREADY WROTE THE CHECK.

27:34.724 --> 27:37.727
THIS IS, LIKE, THE NICEST THING
ANYBODY'S EVER DONE FOR ME.

27:37.727 --> 27:39.729
OH.

27:39.729 --> 27:41.931
BUT I CAN'T GO.

27:41.931 --> 27:43.262
WHY NOT?

27:43.262 --> 27:45.264
MY MOM WOULD NEVER LET ME.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.267
I MEAN, SHE--SHE--SHE THINKS
THIS WHOLE ART THING IS STUPID.

27:48.267 --> 27:51.070
EDDIE, YOU CAN'T LET HER
DO THIS TO YOU.

27:51.070 --> 27:54.103
YOU HAVE SUCH A GIFT.

27:54.103 --> 27:56.045
(sighs)

27:58.407 --> 28:00.309
LISTEN TO ME.

28:00.309 --> 28:03.252
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMETHING
THAT MUCH,

28:03.252 --> 28:05.314
YOU CAN'T JUST LET IT GO.

28:05.314 --> 28:10.089
THAT KIND OF LOVE IS THE ONE
THING THAT KEEPS US GOING,

28:10.089 --> 28:13.192
WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE
TO ANYONE ELSE OR NOT.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.925
WOW.

28:17.767 --> 28:21.270
THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE ONLY
THING THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

28:21.270 --> 28:25.104
THEN TO HELL
WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.406
(chuckles)

28:33.783 --> 28:36.045
MRS. MAYER?

28:36.045 --> 28:38.417
ARE YOU THERE?
IT'S ME, EDDIE.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.821
(Susan) OH, COME ON IN!
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

28:41.821 --> 28:45.294
HEY, THOSE ART CLASSES
WERE AMAZING!

28:45.294 --> 28:46.996
THE FIRST THREE DAYS,

28:46.996 --> 28:50.029
THEY HAD US DO NOTHING
BUT PORTRAITS FROM MEMORY.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.330
AND THEN THEY, UH,

28:51.330 --> 28:54.133
THEY BROUGHT US DOWN
TO THE BEACH TO DO SEASCAPES.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.135
I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO TELL YOU!

28:56.135 --> 28:58.207
YEAH. ME, TOO.

28:58.207 --> 28:59.869
(chuckles)

28:59.869 --> 29:01.941
WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT?

29:01.941 --> 29:04.073
(sighs) I'M GETTING MARRIED.

29:04.073 --> 29:06.375
TO WHO?

29:06.375 --> 29:07.777
MIKE.

29:07.777 --> 29:10.019
UH, BUT HE DIVORCED YOU.

29:10.019 --> 29:12.021
HE MADE YOU SO UNHAPPY.

29:12.021 --> 29:13.252
HE DID.

29:13.252 --> 29:17.256
UH, BUT THEN THIS MADMAN
KIDNAPPED M.J.,

29:17.256 --> 29:20.259
AND SO I WENT AFTER HIM,
AND THEN MIKE CAME AFTER US,

29:20.259 --> 29:22.261
AND HE SAVED US BOTH.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.293
SO WE FELL BACK IN LOVE.

29:24.293 --> 29:27.036
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

29:27.036 --> 29:28.337
IT'S SO QUICK.

29:28.337 --> 29:30.169
I KNOW.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.942
OH, MY GOD.
ARE THOSE ECLAIRS?

29:32.942 --> 29:34.173
YEAH.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.375
OH, THEY LOOK MESSY.
GET THEM AWAY.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.048
SO, YEAH, IT IS QUICK.

29:39.048 --> 29:41.480
I CAN'T BELIEVE IN TWO HOURS,

29:41.480 --> 29:43.883
I'M GONNA BE MARRYING MIKE

29:43.883 --> 29:45.985
AND PROMISING HIM
I'LL BE WITH HIM FOREVER...

29:45.985 --> 29:47.987
(chuckles)
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.289
OH, I HAVE ZERO CREDIBILITY.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.320
(sighs)

29:51.320 --> 29:53.362
OH, LOOK AT ME.

29:53.362 --> 29:56.225
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA
MAKE IT DOWN THE AISLE.

29:56.225 --> 29:58.427
ARE THEY CHOCOLATE?
NO, I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

29:58.427 --> 29:59.929
DON'T DO IT.

29:59.929 --> 30:03.432
THEY JUST SMELL SO GOOD.
 NO, I MEAN THE WEDDING.

30:03.432 --> 30:06.105
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE,
DON'T MARRY MIKE.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.107
OH, NO, EDDIE,
I'VE--I BOOKED THE CHURCH,

30:08.107 --> 30:11.040
I BOUGHT THE DRESS.
I HAVE TO MARRY SOMEBODY.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.413
YOU COULD MARRY ME.

30:16.986 --> 30:18.988
I HAVE SOME MONEY SAVED UP.

30:23.552 --> 30:27.556
(laughs)

30:27.556 --> 30:30.429
OKAY, YOU ALMOST GOT ME.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.903
(laughs)

30:33.903 --> 30:35.464
YOU ARE SO SWEET.

30:35.464 --> 30:37.466
YOU SAW
THAT I WAS FREAKING OUT,

30:37.466 --> 30:39.939
AND YOU KNEW
THAT I NEEDED A GOOD LAUGH.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.211
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
WITHOUT YOU. (kisses)

30:42.211 --> 30:44.213
HEY, I HAVE TO
FINISH GETTING READY.

30:44.213 --> 30:46.876
COME TO THE CHURCH
IF YOU WANT.

30:46.876 --> 30:48.317
OH. WHAT THE HELL?

30:48.317 --> 30:50.249
(bag crinkles)

30:50.249 --> 30:53.052
I CAN ALWAYS USE MY BOUQUET
TO COVER THE STAIN. (laughs)

31:11.470 --> 31:14.043
BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME,

31:14.043 --> 31:17.376
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.578
YOU MAY KISS YOUR BRIDE.

31:21.450 --> 31:23.482
(chuckles)

31:23.482 --> 31:26.485
(cheering)

32:09.328 --> 32:13.302
(bottles rattling)

32:13.302 --> 32:16.165
(gasps)

32:16.165 --> 32:18.567
(choking)

32:23.712 --> 32:26.715
(dog barking in distance)

32:28.447 --> 32:30.279
(whispers) JULIE!

32:34.323 --> 32:37.326
(monitor beeping steadily)

32:38.687 --> 32:41.690
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

32:43.562 --> 32:45.494
EDDIE.

32:45.494 --> 32:48.367
I WAS JUST GETTING SOME COFFEE.
HOW SWEET OF YOU TO VISIT.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.369
WELL, IT'S THE FIRST DAY

32:50.369 --> 32:54.373
THAT THEY ALLOWED
NON-FAMILY MEMBERS.

32:57.306 --> 32:59.548
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
IT HAPPENED.

32:59.548 --> 33:01.480
I KEEP ASKING MYSELF,

33:01.480 --> 33:05.454
HOW CAN THERE BE THIS KIND
OF EVIL IN THE WORLD?

33:09.518 --> 33:12.121
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER
WOULD DO THIS TO HER?

33:18.427 --> 33:20.269
IT WASN'T A MONSTER.

33:22.131 --> 33:25.374
NO, MONSTERS ARE BIG AND STRONG.

33:25.374 --> 33:28.377
THIS WAS DONE BY SOME WEAK,
INSIGNIFICANT PIECE OF GARBAGE

33:28.377 --> 33:30.709
THAT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE
TO BE ON THIS EARTH.

33:33.182 --> 33:35.184
ANYONE WHO COULD DO THIS

33:35.184 --> 33:37.486
TO SOMEONE AS SWEET AS JULIE
AND YOU...

33:37.486 --> 33:39.748
HE SHOULD JUST
DO EVERYONE A FAVOR

33:39.748 --> 33:42.291
AND JUST...

33:42.291 --> 33:45.254
KILL HIMSELF.

33:45.254 --> 33:48.457
ANYONE THAT COULD DO THIS...

33:48.457 --> 33:50.459
IS TOO COWARDLY FOR THAT.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.507
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:09.277 --> 34:12.181
IT WAS DURING
A FRIDAY NIGHT GAME OF CHARADES

34:12.181 --> 34:16.324
THAT LYNETTE WAS CLUED IN
TO THE TRUTH OF EDDIE'S LIFE.

34:16.324 --> 34:17.456
TH-THREE WORDS.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.158
THIRD WORD. THIRD WORD.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.690
YOU. YOU. OH, UH, PREGNANT.

34:22.690 --> 34:25.393
BLOATED. SWOLLEN. HUGE.

34:25.393 --> 34:28.137
LADY, TOM. I'M A LADY.

34:28.137 --> 34:29.697
NO TALKING.
 BETTER THAN HITTING.

34:32.341 --> 34:33.742
"DU BARRY WAS A LADY."

34:33.742 --> 34:35.744
"THREE TIMES A LADY."

34:35.744 --> 34:37.775
UH, "TRAMP AND THE LADY"?
 NO. NO, "MY FAIR LADY"!

34:37.775 --> 34:40.109
YES. YES!

34:40.109 --> 34:42.311
"TRAMP AND THE LADY."
REALLY?

34:42.311 --> 34:44.413
(doorbell rings)
 COMING!

34:44.413 --> 34:49.518
IT'S NOT EASY WHEN YOU'RE
SWOLLEN, BLOATED AND HUGE.

34:49.518 --> 34:52.161
WHERE'S MY KID?

34:52.161 --> 34:55.264
HEY, BARBARA. HE'S IN HERE
WITH US. YOU WANT TO COME IN?

34:55.264 --> 34:57.326
NO.

34:57.326 --> 34:59.798
EDDIE.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.271
GET OUT HERE.

35:07.206 --> 35:10.209
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER
YOUR PHONE?

35:10.209 --> 35:12.211
WELL, THAT WAS
PROBABLY OUR FAULT.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.483
UM,
WE WERE PLAYING CHARADES,

35:14.483 --> 35:18.417
AND YOU KNOW HOW LOUD
THAT CAN GET.
 YEAH, I GUESS MY INVITATION
GOT LOST IN THE MAIL.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.749
YOU GOTTA COME HOME.
 IT'S NOT EVEN 8:00, MOM.

35:20.749 --> 35:23.192
I DON'T CARE.
 MOM, I'M HAVING FUN.

35:23.192 --> 35:25.824
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

35:25.824 --> 35:28.727
BEFORE YOU HID MY STUFF.
 I DIDN'T HIDE IT.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.429
EVERYTHING OKAY?
 IT'S NOTHING.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.331
YEAH, HE HIDES MY BOOZE

35:32.331 --> 35:34.333
AND THEN ACTS ALL ASHAMED
WHEN I CALL HIM ON IT.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.336
I KNOW YOU HID IT,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD.
 HEY.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.468
NO, MRS. SCAVO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

35:39.468 --> 35:42.511
MOM, COME ON.
I'LL WALK YOU HOME.

35:42.511 --> 35:46.775
I-I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
TALK TO YOUR SON THAT WAY.

35:48.577 --> 35:49.878
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

35:49.878 --> 35:52.551
HUH? WHAT IS HE,
YOUR PET PROJECT?

35:52.551 --> 35:54.553
YOU FEED HIM A LITTLE DINNER,
LYNETTE,

35:54.553 --> 35:56.785
AND THEN YOU LET HIM
PLAY YOUR STUPID GAMES

35:56.785 --> 35:59.458
SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.461
YEAH.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.263
I GOT YOUR NUMBER.

36:23.452 --> 36:25.414
(speaking inaudibly)

36:27.886 --> 36:30.559
I'M OUT OF SCOTCH.

36:30.559 --> 36:33.262
I'LL BUY YOU SOME MORE
WHILE I'M OUT.

36:33.262 --> 36:36.365
GOT ANY IN YOUR ROOM?

36:36.365 --> 36:39.568
NO. AND STAY OUT OF THERE.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.606
HI, MRS. SCAVO.
I'M HERE TO FIX YOUR CAR.

36:47.606 --> 36:51.280
YOU ARE SO SWEET
TO REMEMBER THIS. THANK YOU.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.811
SO...

36:52.811 --> 36:55.514
HOW ARE THINGS AT HOME?

36:55.514 --> 36:58.547
ARE THE TOOLS IN THE GARAGE?
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET STARTED.

36:58.547 --> 36:59.818
YEAH.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.390
OKAY.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.463
HEY. WE GOT ANY CAKE LEFT?

37:14.463 --> 37:16.565
I'M NOT SURE.

37:16.565 --> 37:18.667
YOU OKAY?

37:18.667 --> 37:22.611
I DON'T KNOW. I KEEP
THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

37:22.611 --> 37:24.943
MM. YEAH, ME, TOO.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.546
AND I'M JUST SO...

37:29.518 --> 37:31.450
LIVID.

37:31.450 --> 37:35.484
YEAH. THAT BARBARA IS
AN INFURIATING WOMAN.

37:35.484 --> 37:38.887
NO. TOM, NO.
I AM LIVID AT US--

37:38.887 --> 37:42.291
THE WAY SHE TALKED TO EDDIE,
AND WE DID NOTHING.

37:42.291 --> 37:46.565
I KNOW. BUT WE CAN'T FORCE HER
TO BE NICE TO HER OWN KID.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.567
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
ALWAYS SAYS.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.570
BUT WE ALL KNOW THE WOMAN
IS A DRUNKEN NIGHTMARE.

37:51.570 --> 37:55.344
WE COMPLAIN ABOUT HER,
WE GOSSIP ABOUT HER,

37:55.344 --> 37:58.447
AND THEN WE WATCH HER
WALK INTO THAT HOUSE,

37:58.447 --> 38:01.950
WHERE WE KNOW
SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.482
BUT WE DO NOTHING.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.614
(kettle whistling)

38:05.614 --> 38:07.656
WELL...

38:07.656 --> 38:10.959
I'M TIRED OF BEING ONE
OF THE PEOPLE WHO DOES NOTHING.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.992
WELL,
EDDIE IS AN ADULT NOW.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.665
AND HE CAN LEAVE
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

38:16.665 --> 38:19.698
HE'S PROBABLY SO DAMAGED,
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO LEAVE.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.835
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THIS?

38:26.835 --> 38:30.939
MA, I'M BACK FROM THE STORE.

38:30.939 --> 38:32.881
MA?

38:34.683 --> 38:36.445
WHAT IS THAT?

38:36.445 --> 38:38.587
YOUR SCRAPBOOK.

38:41.350 --> 38:44.052
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, EDDIE.

38:44.052 --> 38:46.825
THERE ARE ALL THESE
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES IN HERE

38:46.825 --> 38:50.459
ABOUT GIRLS IN FAIRVIEW
WHO HAVE BEEN...

38:50.459 --> 38:52.661
STRANGLED OR MURDERED.

38:55.063 --> 38:58.637
WHY WOULD YOU COLLECT
THIS STUFF?

39:00.909 --> 39:05.343
DON'T JUST LOOK DOWN
AT YOUR FEET.

39:05.343 --> 39:09.347
YOU GOTTA TELL ME THE TRUTH,
OKAY?

39:09.347 --> 39:11.680
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH...

39:11.680 --> 39:13.552
HURTING THOSE GIRLS?

39:18.086 --> 39:21.460
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.831
(dishes clatter)

39:22.831 --> 39:26.034
HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS? OH, GOD.

39:26.034 --> 39:29.668
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU
TO--TO BE LIKE THIS.

39:32.501 --> 39:34.002
DIDN'T YOU?

39:34.002 --> 39:36.475
(exhales deeply)

39:36.475 --> 39:39.608
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
THIS IS MY FAULT?

39:39.608 --> 39:42.551
LOOK... YOU'RE UPSET.

39:44.453 --> 39:47.586
WHY DON'T YOU SIT BACK DOWN
AND HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK?

39:47.586 --> 39:50.619
YOU'RE GONNA TRY
TO BLAME THIS ON ME.

39:50.619 --> 39:52.591
NO WAY.

39:52.591 --> 39:55.123
SCREW YOU.

39:57.426 --> 40:01.470
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING, YOU
MORON? I'M CALLING THE POLICE!

40:01.470 --> 40:03.502
DON'T DO THAT.
P-PUT THAT DOWN.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.505
I ALWAYS SAID THE WORST MISTAKE
I EVER MADE IN MY LIFE

40:06.505 --> 40:08.507
WAS HAVING YOU.

40:10.579 --> 40:12.441
(grunts)
 (grunts)

40:12.441 --> 40:14.943
(gasps)
 (bottle thuds and rolls)

40:19.548 --> 40:22.621
(both screaming and grunting)

40:25.754 --> 40:28.757
(choking)

40:30.829 --> 40:33.832
(panting)

40:45.514 --> 40:47.546
(keys jangle)

40:47.546 --> 40:50.679
HEY, EDDIE. PERFECT TIMING.
 (panting) MRS. SCAVO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:50.679 --> 40:52.621
ARE YOU OKAY?

40:52.621 --> 40:54.553
OH, MY GOSH,
YOU'RE TREMBLING AND--

40:54.553 --> 40:58.026
OH, YEAH, I'M JUST--
I'M--I WAS ON MY WAY OUT.
 THEN I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

40:58.026 --> 41:01.590
TOM AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING,
AND...

41:01.590 --> 41:04.793
WE WOULD LIKE IT
IF YOU WOULD MOVE IN WITH US.

41:04.793 --> 41:05.964
(chuckles)

41:05.964 --> 41:07.966
I KNOW IT'S A BIG CHANGE,

41:07.966 --> 41:10.539
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE, EDDIE.

41:10.539 --> 41:12.801
THIS ISN'T
A HEALTHY SITUATION.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.104
YEAH.

41:16.104 --> 41:18.146
I GUESS IT COULD BE BETTER.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.013
OH, MY GOD.

41:27.185 --> 41:28.757
IS SHE PASSED OUT?

41:28.757 --> 41:30.789
YEAH.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.791
THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.794
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.896
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER--

41:37.896 --> 41:39.628
DEAD DRUNK.

41:39.628 --> 41:42.130
(whispers) OKAY.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.833
(normal voice)
I'LL COME LIVE WITH YOU.

41:44.833 --> 41:48.637
GREAT. SO JUST PACK YOUR BAGS
AND COME ON OVER.

41:48.637 --> 41:50.639
I HOPE YOU LIKE MEAT LOAF.

41:50.639 --> 41:52.140
(laughs and sniffles)

41:52.140 --> 41:54.643
YOU WANT ME TO COME IN
AND HELP YOU,

41:54.643 --> 41:57.646
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK
LATER TO TALK TO HER?

41:57.646 --> 42:01.189
BELIEVE ME, MRS. SCAVO,
SHE WOULDN'T HEAR A WORD.

42:01.189 --> 42:02.951
OKAY.

42:08.056 --> 42:11.199
(crow cawing)

42:11.199 --> 42:15.033
THERE IS A HOUSE
IN THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW.

42:15.033 --> 42:20.709
INSIDE THIS HOUSE
LIVES A MONSTER...

42:20.709 --> 42:24.242
THE KIND WHO KILLS WOMEN.

42:24.242 --> 42:29.778
YOU MAY WONDER HOW A MONSTER
LIKE THAT CAME TO BE.

42:29.778 --> 42:33.782
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE--

42:33.782 --> 42:37.125
MONSTERS ARE CREATED...

42:37.125 --> 42:40.158
BY OTHER MONSTERS.
