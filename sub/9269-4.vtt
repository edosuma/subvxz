00:02.726 --> 00:05.646
I have been... angry...

00:08.246 --> 00:10.086
jealous.

00:11.086 --> 00:13.126
I have given in to self-pity.

00:16.806 --> 00:19.446
Do you have any mortal sins
to confess?

00:20.446 --> 00:22.166
I have...

00:23.166 --> 00:27.126
loved... outside of marriage.

00:28.446 --> 00:32.406
Violet, many people return
to the fold when they face death.

00:34.446 --> 00:36.285
But they cannot find true salvation

00:36.286 --> 00:38.646
if they hide
their selves from God.

00:40.126 --> 00:44.046
If you killed your husband,
don't you want to confess?

00:45.486 --> 00:49.886
Tell his family where the body
is and clear your conscience?

00:55.166 --> 00:57.205
Violet...

00:57.206 --> 00:59.366
From the Lord Chief Justice?

01:05.446 --> 01:07.486
They turned it down?

01:08.806 --> 01:12.006
Appeal unsuccessful.

01:20.326 --> 01:22.846
You know now that death is certain.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.486
Confess...

01:27.486 --> 01:30.046
so that God can forgive your sin.

01:31.766 --> 01:34.965
I can't admit
what I didn't do, Father.

01:34.966 --> 01:38.245
I'm not guilty, I am innocent.

01:38.246 --> 01:40.445
Help me, please!

01:40.446 --> 01:43.686
We have to take you in now.
You can't do this!

01:55.246 --> 01:57.366
Charlie! Charlie!

01:58.566 --> 02:00.845
Charlie!

02:00.846 --> 02:02.525
Wait!

02:02.526 --> 02:04.766
You can't do this! I'm pregnant!

02:47.006 --> 02:49.125
The lab will have
to run a pregnancy test.

02:49.126 --> 02:52.285
It'll take a few days
to show a response...

02:52.286 --> 02:54.325
So she has three days' reprieve?

02:54.326 --> 02:58.005
If it comes back positive
the death sentence will be commuted.

02:58.006 --> 03:01.806
And if it's negative?
We go through all this again.

03:02.926 --> 03:07.006
14 weeks since she was arrested -
why hasn't she mentioned it before?

03:08.086 --> 03:11.485
Father, save me.
How can I help?

03:11.486 --> 03:14.485
You have to prove me innocent.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.925
You have to give me
something to go on.

03:16.926 --> 03:21.326
Peter. He's the key. Find Peter!
Get moving.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.406
Archie! Wilfred!

03:31.566 --> 03:33.605
Ma, I don't think you should get up.

03:33.606 --> 03:37.445
I can't just lie here.
Not till I know it's done.

03:37.446 --> 03:39.366
Come on, help me.

03:45.846 --> 03:51.446
Oi, ready? On my count -
one, two, three.

03:56.886 --> 03:59.485
They say the eyes pop out -
is that true?

03:59.486 --> 04:01.525
I'm going to go see the body.

04:01.526 --> 04:04.245
If I could've watched her dangle,
I would've.

04:04.246 --> 04:06.605
For heaven's sake, Ma!
Can't we get on with our lives?

04:06.606 --> 04:09.325
Before your brother's
murderer gets her due?

04:09.326 --> 04:13.805
My Ivan looked after me for years.
I'm looking after you now.

04:13.806 --> 04:16.685
Why haven't they telephoned?

04:16.685 --> 04:19.005
They said they'd telephone
when it was done.

04:24.766 --> 04:26.646
3764.

04:28.526 --> 04:30.285
Wh-?

04:30.286 --> 04:32.246
What?

04:40.966 --> 04:44.485
I know why you're here, Father.
I suggest you stop now.

04:44.486 --> 04:46.845
Just picking up
something for supper.

04:46.846 --> 04:48.845
There's no law against that,
is there?

04:48.846 --> 04:52.006
And it's mere happenstance
that it's from Fernsley's?

04:53.046 --> 04:55.365
His sausages are the talk
of the town.

04:55.366 --> 04:57.885
Pork and hop.
Isn't your mouth watering?

04:57.886 --> 05:00.645
I see you're as susceptible
to a charming countenance

05:00.646 --> 05:02.045
as the rest of mankind.

05:02.046 --> 05:06.405
I don't... We have the right woman,
irrespective of what Violet may say.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.405
I guarantee it.

05:08.406 --> 05:12.125
Guarantee is a strong word.
They never even found a body!

05:12.126 --> 05:15.925
Just because you weren't around
to meddle during the investigation...

05:15.926 --> 05:18.525
"Meddle"? If only you went
on retreat more often.

05:18.526 --> 05:22.445
I can just about put up with your
pottering before a case is solved,

05:22.446 --> 05:24.525
but once a murderer's
been found guilty,

05:24.526 --> 05:27.165
it's wasting police time
to rake it up again.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.965
How could I not?

05:28.966 --> 05:33.206
She's a lost sheep from my flock
- defenceless, pregnant.

05:34.486 --> 05:38.046
You don't believe it?
I've seen the medical reports.

05:39.446 --> 05:42.205
She lost a baby at eight months gone
after Ivan hit her.

05:42.206 --> 05:44.245
Her system never recovered.

05:44.246 --> 05:46.366
It's highly unlikely
she can have children.

05:47.606 --> 05:49.405
I knew he was violent, but...

05:49.406 --> 05:51.165
The point is Violet's lied.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.925
And if she'd lie about her pregnancy,

05:53.926 --> 05:57.125
why wouldn't
she lie about the killing?

05:57.126 --> 06:00.086
Now then, Father, isn't it time
you were on your way?

06:02.726 --> 06:04.806
Right you are.

06:26.846 --> 06:28.846
Peter?

06:31.806 --> 06:35.246
I know about six Peters,
like everybody else in Kembleford.

06:38.286 --> 06:41.446
But none of them had anything
to do with Ivan's murder.

06:59.006 --> 07:01.326
Still here, Father?

07:02.406 --> 07:05.325
You've inherited the tenancy
of the pig farm

07:05.326 --> 07:07.526
now your brother's gone,
haven't you?

07:08.526 --> 07:10.485
That supposed to be a motive?

07:10.486 --> 07:13.405
I'm doing better with the shop
than the farm ever did.

07:13.406 --> 07:17.566
Give it five years, I'll have
branches in Broadway and Toddington.

07:18.926 --> 07:20.966
A man of ambition.

07:23.126 --> 07:26.725
Of course, if anyone knows
how to make a body vanish,

07:26.726 --> 07:29.006
it's a butcher.

07:30.926 --> 07:33.565
They got the right woman
when they sent Violet down.

07:33.566 --> 07:37.166
And that pregnancy's cobblers.
She'll get what's coming to her.

07:38.166 --> 07:42.205
Meantime, I'd stay away from us,
Father,

07:42.206 --> 07:44.246
if you know what's good for you.

08:01.046 --> 08:02.966
So? I didn't...

08:04.846 --> 08:06.886
I didn't know how you'd feel.

08:08.086 --> 08:09.966
If you'd even want a baby with me.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.726
So it's true?
I think so.

08:14.726 --> 08:18.166
I can't be sure.
Was this what it was all about, then?

08:19.326 --> 08:21.886
Getting pregnant to escape
the gallows? No!

08:23.086 --> 08:25.845
I never believed they'd actually...

08:25.846 --> 08:28.246
I thought the appeal would succeed.

08:29.326 --> 08:32.845
I thought we'd live
the rest of our lives together.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.684
And the baby?
Are you sure it's...

08:35.686 --> 08:38.645
If you're going to ask if
it's yours, you can leave now.

08:46.806 --> 08:51.445
Why didn't you tell me, Vi?
I told you, I wasn't sure.

08:51.446 --> 08:55.126
It was bad enough me hoping,
praying...

08:56.326 --> 09:01.406
I couldn't put you through that,
too. If you even wanted my baby.

09:02.486 --> 09:05.206
How could I not want our baby?

09:08.406 --> 09:10.446
I know it's not much...

09:14.006 --> 09:16.366
Violet Fernsley.

09:17.606 --> 09:19.646
Will you marry me?

09:40.406 --> 09:42.406
Sid.

09:45.006 --> 09:47.045
Come here often? Mm-hmm.

09:47.046 --> 09:49.965
Lady Felicia's comforting
Mrs Fernsley.

09:49.966 --> 09:53.085
She takes care of her tenant farms
by reading her book to them

09:53.086 --> 09:55.525
once a week at least.
Very generous.

09:55.526 --> 09:58.005
Well, you haven't read her book.

09:58.006 --> 10:00.925
Lady Felicia's many things,
but... a writer?

10:00.926 --> 10:03.686
Generous of Mrs Fernsley, I mean.

10:04.686 --> 10:08.166
Well, I'm here to see the lady of
the house as well, so I'll wait.

10:10.766 --> 10:15.005
Both of Ethel's younger sons live
out here too, don't they? Mm-hmm.

10:15.006 --> 10:17.046
Seen anyone else? Nope.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.046
You snooping, Father?

10:31.606 --> 10:34.565
You're friends with Officer Denham,
aren't you?

10:34.566 --> 10:37.845
I wouldn't say friend, exactly. Go
to the dogs together now and again.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.965
So you knew about him and Violet.
What? No. I didn't know nothing.

10:41.966 --> 10:45.765
Calm down, Sid. I won't tell anyone.
Scout's honour?

10:45.766 --> 10:48.326
You have my word of honour,
as man of God.

10:49.806 --> 10:52.005
Did they meet in prison?

10:52.006 --> 10:54.646
Or could they have
known each other before?

10:55.926 --> 10:59.885
You don't really think Charlie's got
anything to do with this, do you?

10:59.886 --> 11:02.326
I'm keeping an open mind.

11:08.526 --> 11:10.526
Hello?

11:14.966 --> 11:18.085
After all, Ivan might not
even be dead.

11:18.086 --> 11:20.325
He must've got himself
a transfusion, then.

11:20.326 --> 11:22.925
Do you have any idea
how much blood they found?

11:22.926 --> 11:25.565
There are other possible killers.

11:25.566 --> 11:27.925
Like who?

11:27.926 --> 11:32.165
Did I scare you?
That's gamekeeping, you see.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.245
My stock-in-trade -
stillness and silence.

11:36.246 --> 11:38.165
One of your catches?

11:38.166 --> 11:41.965
The fox got this one.
Along with three of my hens.

11:41.966 --> 11:45.005
He kills for fun, just rips their
throats out.

11:45.006 --> 11:47.006
I'll get my revenge.

11:49.366 --> 11:52.125
Enjoy your job, do you?
No law against that, is there?

11:52.126 --> 11:56.606
Lonely work.
These beauties keep me company.

12:04.406 --> 12:07.725
This "Piotr",
does he still work here?

12:07.726 --> 12:11.645
We did have a labourer called Peter,
Piotr.

12:11.646 --> 12:15.005
Polish, I think.
Bit of a soft spot for Violet.

12:15.006 --> 12:18.966
Course, Ivan didn't like that,
so... think he left.

12:20.566 --> 12:24.206
Sausage roll? Our own produce.

12:25.926 --> 12:27.966
Lovely.

12:31.926 --> 12:34.246
They say pig tastes
most like people.

12:36.046 --> 12:40.006
"Long pig", that's what the
cannibal tribes call human meat.

12:41.246 --> 12:44.406
Gone down the wrong way.
Perhaps some water?

12:52.046 --> 12:54.086
Still think Violet murdered him?

12:58.486 --> 13:03.446
"Gerald's guttural scream
cut the air like a cheese-knife."

13:07.286 --> 13:10.645
We'll pick up chapter ten on Friday,
how does that sound?

13:10.646 --> 13:12.726
Friday it is.

13:13.926 --> 13:16.405
Oh, Father, so good of you
to come comfort Ethel...

13:16.406 --> 13:18.525
But I must warn you, she's tired.

13:18.526 --> 13:21.045
We've had a very emotional session.
So I heard.

13:21.046 --> 13:23.565
She's very good
at making suggestions.

13:23.566 --> 13:26.605
Better than you are, anyway.
When are you going to give me notes?

13:26.606 --> 13:28.485
I'm no literary critic.

13:28.486 --> 13:31.485
I hope you are here
just to comfort her.

13:31.486 --> 13:34.845
Ivan's death was almost too
much for Ethel.

13:34.846 --> 13:36.966
Dragging it all up won't help.

13:49.006 --> 13:52.046
Father! Oh, I didn't know.

13:53.926 --> 13:56.285
Archie! Archie, I need your help.

13:56.286 --> 13:59.326
Mrs Fernsley.
Don't concern yourself.

14:00.566 --> 14:02.845
Archie's already been very
hospitable.

14:02.846 --> 14:05.046
That'll be the first time.

14:07.766 --> 14:11.045
You'll have seen
he's not quite right.

14:11.046 --> 14:14.685
Poor Ivan dropped him on his head
when he was small.

14:14.686 --> 14:17.726
Forgive me,
I'm loath to ask questions...

14:18.726 --> 14:23.965
in this time of trail for you, but
a woman's life hangs in the balance.

14:23.966 --> 14:27.645
And I can't let it lie
unless I find some answers.

14:27.646 --> 14:31.686
Do your worst, Father.
We have nothing to hide.

14:33.166 --> 14:37.485
You had a labourer called Piotr.
Perhaps you knew him as Peter.

14:37.486 --> 14:40.845
When did he leave?
Three months ago. Maybe four.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.445
Around the same time of Ivan's
disappearance?

14:43.446 --> 14:45.285
About that time, yes.

14:45.286 --> 14:49.085
Casual labourers are just that
- here one day, gone the next.

14:49.086 --> 14:52.445
You're wasting your time, Father.

14:52.446 --> 14:55.645
That woman killed my son.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.965
What makes you so sure?

14:57.966 --> 15:01.565
Like I told the police,

15:01.566 --> 15:04.605
the evening Ivan disappeared,

15:04.606 --> 15:09.086
I heard them arguing
and then it suddenly went quiet.

15:10.726 --> 15:14.525
The next day, I was in the kitchen

15:14.526 --> 15:18.766
and I saw Violet washing
at the water trough in the yard.

15:21.726 --> 15:26.525
Is that unusual? There was blood
on her hands, her dress.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.525
The water was red with it.

15:28.526 --> 15:31.805
Blood that may have
come from slaughtering a chicken,

15:31.806 --> 15:34.805
skinning a rabbit.
She said she'd been bitten by a sow.

15:34.806 --> 15:36.686
There we are.

15:37.726 --> 15:40.526
They examined her
when they arrested her.

15:42.446 --> 15:45.366
If she had been bitten,
it didn't break the skin.

15:49.846 --> 15:51.886
Where do you think she hid the body?

15:53.326 --> 15:57.446
In the river? The marsh?
Any number of places on a farm.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.645
You dig all you want, Father.

16:01.646 --> 16:04.366
You'll only find out
what I already know.

16:05.726 --> 16:10.126
My son is dead
and that woman killed him.

16:11.486 --> 16:14.406
Hello?

16:16.166 --> 16:18.366
I'm here to make a complaint.

16:20.366 --> 16:24.046
Could you please open this door?
I want to make a complaint!

16:28.966 --> 16:33.765
That mutton you sold Father Brown
yesterday - dry as a bone.

16:33.766 --> 16:36.605
I can't legislate
for the cooking process.

16:36.606 --> 16:40.125
I'll have you know I learnt my
culinary skills at my mother's knee,

16:40.126 --> 16:44.525
and she was the finest cook
in County Cork. That will explain it.

16:44.526 --> 16:48.885
I want compensation
- some nice, fresh meat,

16:48.886 --> 16:51.325
none of that offal
you're pummelling at.

16:51.326 --> 16:53.885
These are Gloucester's
finest pig's stomachs

16:53.886 --> 16:56.966
and are used for Gloucestershire's
finest sausages.

17:01.006 --> 17:03.406
And what is that?

17:08.286 --> 17:11.325
It's a ring.
On a finger, is it?

17:11.326 --> 17:13.365
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.005
Is that what she did with
poor Ivan's body? Don't count on it.

17:17.006 --> 17:19.085
I once cut open a cow's stomach

17:19.086 --> 17:21.605
and found a key that'd
been missing for three years.

17:21.606 --> 17:23.645
This could belong to anyone.

17:23.646 --> 17:25.806
We'll let the inspector
be the judge of that.

17:28.246 --> 17:31.605
The jewellers have confirmed
that it's Ivan Fernsley's.

17:31.606 --> 17:34.525
So now we know how
she disposed of the corpse.

17:34.526 --> 17:37.045
All this proves is that Ivan
Fernsley is dead...

17:37.046 --> 17:38.885
or missing a finger.

17:38.886 --> 17:41.485
Anyone could have put
that body in the pigpen.

17:41.486 --> 17:43.965
The pregnancy test comes back
tomorrow, Father.

17:43.966 --> 17:46.165
You'll have to do better
than vague allegations

17:46.166 --> 17:48.646
if you truly hope
to stall this execution.

17:52.686 --> 17:55.525
Piotr Symanski, the casual labourer

17:55.526 --> 17:58.125
who worked at the farm
at the time of Ivan's death.

17:58.126 --> 18:00.165
He disappeared.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.405
So he took a new job,
found himself a nice English rose

18:02.406 --> 18:05.406
and quietly left his old life behind.
And left no trace.

18:06.846 --> 18:08.925
Isn't that suspicious?

18:08.926 --> 18:13.006
Archie Fernsley says Piotr had
a run-in with Ivan about his wife.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.645
Doesn't that make him
an alternative suspect?

18:16.646 --> 18:20.045
Father, Piotr came up
in the original investigation.

18:20.046 --> 18:22.846
He left the farm six
weeks before Ivan was killed.

18:30.486 --> 18:33.165
Charlie. Any news on the test?

18:33.166 --> 18:36.206
The Father's here to give you
Holy Communion.

18:37.606 --> 18:39.806
I'm sorry, I didn't...

18:41.446 --> 18:44.165
Honestly, it doesn't matter
that he knows.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.405
Father will keep our secret.

18:46.406 --> 18:50.846
And when I'm out, he'll marry us!
Won't you, Father?

18:51.886 --> 18:53.926
One thing at a time.

18:55.326 --> 18:57.965
Well, I'm glad, you know.

18:57.966 --> 19:01.006
I've been wanting to offer my help
with your... digging.

19:02.446 --> 19:04.925
Anything I can do
to clear Violet's name.

19:04.926 --> 19:06.926
I'll think about that.

19:08.966 --> 19:12.246
I'll leave you to it.

19:19.246 --> 19:23.245
I've pulled all sorts
of strings to get in here.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.605
Please tell me
you've found something, Father.

19:25.606 --> 19:29.286
Only Ivan's finger bone
in a pig's stomach.

19:30.966 --> 19:34.245
It does not look good for you.

19:34.246 --> 19:36.086
Don't you believe me?

19:37.086 --> 19:39.125
Time is running out!

19:39.126 --> 19:42.686
Then why send me on a wild goose
chase about Peter, Piotr?

19:44.406 --> 19:47.165
He left the farm before Ivan died.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.686
I didn't mean
he could be a suspect!

19:51.286 --> 19:53.646
I thought he could've been a victim.

19:55.046 --> 20:00.605
What? He was kind,
he saw how Ivan treated me.

20:00.606 --> 20:03.126
He said he could help me get away.

20:04.646 --> 20:06.965
He found someone to take me in.

20:06.966 --> 20:10.325
The plan was to drive me over there
when Ivan was in bed

20:10.326 --> 20:14.526
but the night he'd planned
to do it... he was gone.

20:16.246 --> 20:19.885
So two men have disappeared
without trace from the farm,

20:19.886 --> 20:21.886
within weeks of each other?

20:24.446 --> 20:26.885
We have wasted two whole days.

20:26.886 --> 20:30.686
If you are right we are looking
for someone who has killed twice.

20:52.326 --> 20:54.366
Two deaths, now?

20:55.366 --> 20:57.965
Yes, and the pregnancy test
comes back today.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.445
Well, if it wasn't her
we'll soon find out who it was.

21:00.446 --> 21:03.125
Archie Fernsley's not clever enough
to have hidden all trace.

21:03.126 --> 21:05.765
I'm not convinced it's Archie
we're after. Hey, isn't that...

21:05.766 --> 21:08.686
Charlie, yes.
What's he doing here?

21:11.766 --> 21:13.646
Mrs Fernsley?

21:15.486 --> 21:17.526
Archie?

21:20.966 --> 21:25.446
What you doing?
As we're here, might as well.

21:30.846 --> 21:33.086
Well, come on then.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.486
Well, lookee here.

21:51.726 --> 21:54.685
Looks like Wilf took Ivan
to court over the inheritance.

21:54.686 --> 21:56.645
And lost.

21:56.646 --> 21:58.685
So much for Wilf
not being interested

21:58.686 --> 22:00.406
in running the family farm.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.645
Maybe you were right
about it not being Archie.

22:04.646 --> 22:06.686
What's going on?

22:08.366 --> 22:10.805
Ah, Archie.
We were hoping we'd catch you.

22:10.806 --> 22:14.205
Are you searching our house?
Put that stuff down.

22:14.206 --> 22:16.645
Hey, Archie, look, look,
there's no need to...

22:16.646 --> 22:18.486
Hey, hey!

22:21.326 --> 22:23.285
Take a breath.

22:23.286 --> 22:26.806
All right, you're not listening!

22:32.406 --> 22:34.606
Look what you've done!

22:37.526 --> 22:40.166
Archie, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to...

22:41.766 --> 22:44.006
Archie.

22:46.526 --> 22:50.165
The rings and watches
that you've put on your animals,

22:50.166 --> 22:52.806
where did you find them?

22:54.126 --> 22:56.606
Just bits of old rubbish.
Finders keepers.

22:57.766 --> 23:02.485
This belongs to Peter.
So? I was cleaning the slurry tank.

23:02.486 --> 23:04.885
They were all in there.
Pigs will eat anything.

23:04.886 --> 23:07.205
This is engraved.

23:07.206 --> 23:10.966
It isn't something
you'd throw away or leave behind.

23:13.526 --> 23:17.365
Archie, did you find anything else
in the slurry tank?

23:17.366 --> 23:19.406
No.

23:20.526 --> 23:22.566
This "treasure"...

23:24.166 --> 23:26.206
Father, it's teeth...

23:32.246 --> 23:36.965
This belonged to Piotr Symanski,
as did this.

23:36.966 --> 23:39.525
But this is someone else's
wedding ring.

23:39.526 --> 23:41.805
Am I supposed to read
something into these?

23:41.806 --> 23:45.005
And look at all these teeth.
Ivan wasn't the only victim.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.445
Whoever killed him
has killed before,

23:47.446 --> 23:49.325
more than once.

23:49.326 --> 23:52.045
Does that sound like Violet to you?
I see.

23:52.046 --> 23:54.765
Yesterday Piotr was the murderer.
Today he's now the victim.

23:54.766 --> 23:58.565
What will he be tomorrow, I wonder?
This is no time for levity.

23:58.566 --> 24:01.125
OK, if Piotr
and Violet are out of the picture,

24:01.126 --> 24:03.606
who's your current potential
mass-murderer?

24:49.286 --> 24:51.005
What are you doing?

24:51.006 --> 24:52.805
Was it you? What?

24:52.806 --> 24:55.125
That flue's been stuffed with rags.

24:55.126 --> 24:58.525
If the stove's belching out fumes
into the hut, it will take, what,

24:58.526 --> 25:01.445
20 minutes, less,
till they're out cold?

25:01.446 --> 25:02.806
Who?

25:03.886 --> 25:05.485
You kill them yourself?

25:05.486 --> 25:07.125
Or do you let the pigs do the rest?

25:07.126 --> 25:08.645
You think I'm a murderer?

25:08.646 --> 25:09.926
I'm your brother!

25:11.646 --> 25:13.885
I know that better than anyone.

25:13.886 --> 25:16.365
You think I've forgot
what you used to do?

25:16.366 --> 25:19.445
I found that litter of collie pups
when you finished with them.

25:19.446 --> 25:22.165
Why do you want to put this on me?

25:22.166 --> 25:24.965
I should never have given you
an alibi for Ivan's disappearance.

25:24.966 --> 25:26.325
That goes both ways.

25:26.326 --> 25:27.965
You're the one who hated him.

25:27.966 --> 25:30.165
You're the one who lost out
on the farm.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.125
Why would I kill my own brother?

25:32.126 --> 25:33.685
I don't know.

25:33.686 --> 25:36.046
Why would you kill your own dogs?

25:38.766 --> 25:40.565
I didn't do it!

25:40.566 --> 25:44.085
Yeah, we'll let the police
be the judge of that!

25:44.086 --> 25:45.645
They both have alibis?

25:45.646 --> 25:48.725
They were wildfowling that evening.

25:48.726 --> 25:51.765
Together? Yes!

25:51.766 --> 25:54.685
So Archie and Wilf provided
each other with alibis?

25:54.686 --> 25:56.605
Don't you see, Inspector...

25:56.606 --> 25:58.245
No, don't YOU see?!

25:58.246 --> 26:00.445
Even if I accept that
these trinkets prove that

26:00.446 --> 26:02.645
other murders were committed,
it's only putting

26:02.646 --> 26:04.765
Violet in the picture there, too.

26:04.766 --> 26:07.245
You're making things worse
for her, Father, not better.

26:07.246 --> 26:10.606
Now, I'd like you to leave.
I have genuine police work to do!

26:16.566 --> 26:18.406
Hey! Hey!

26:21.926 --> 26:23.726
Aargh! Aargh!

26:36.006 --> 26:40.086
Sir, Ethel Fernsley,
reporting screams.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.925
'I heard him crying out.'

26:46.926 --> 26:51.365
Please, help. I can't move,
I'm trapped here!

26:51.366 --> 26:53.246
Mrs Fernsley, do you know how...

26:54.646 --> 26:56.286
Mrs Fernsley?

27:02.326 --> 27:04.086
You can collect me in an hour.

27:10.726 --> 27:12.006
Hello?

27:15.886 --> 27:17.286
Hello?

27:31.286 --> 27:32.805
Thank the Lord you're here.

27:32.806 --> 27:35.045
Do you want to tell me
what happened? Mm!

27:35.046 --> 27:37.925
Weren't you just saying you thought
Wilfred might be the killer?

27:37.926 --> 27:39.885
Time to strike him
off your suspect list.

27:39.886 --> 27:41.206
Wilf is dead?

27:42.606 --> 27:45.605
Lady Felicia,
I don't have a WPC at my disposal.

27:45.606 --> 27:47.845
Thank you, I'll be quite
all right without one.

27:47.846 --> 27:51.406
No, I mean, would you mind
attempting to comfort Mrs Fernsley?

27:56.806 --> 27:58.406
Thank you.

28:03.606 --> 28:04.645
Another murder.

28:04.646 --> 28:06.965
Another corpse disposed of
in the same way as Ivan's.

28:06.966 --> 28:10.405
How many more people have to die
before you will listen to me?

28:10.406 --> 28:12.885
I presume you believe this proves
it's the same killer

28:12.886 --> 28:15.005
and Violet's innocent?

28:15.006 --> 28:16.725
It is a possibility.

28:16.726 --> 28:18.645
Another is that it's just a copycat.

28:18.646 --> 28:21.525
A third is that there is a second
killer who's working with Violet.

28:21.526 --> 28:23.285
That prison officer.

28:23.286 --> 28:25.325
Who is he, her beau?

28:25.326 --> 28:27.765
He was here earlier, sniffing about.

28:27.766 --> 28:31.725
Bullying Ma and saying
it was me or Wilf that killed Ivan.

28:31.726 --> 28:34.365
What officer is this?

28:34.366 --> 28:36.205
What's happening out there?

28:36.206 --> 28:37.725
What have they said?

28:37.726 --> 28:39.525
They're doing everything they can.

28:39.526 --> 28:41.885
That's what they said about Ivan.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.845
Someone's out to get us!

28:43.846 --> 28:47.245
Don't worry. The police are
going to get whoever did this.

28:47.246 --> 28:50.525
I can't just lie here. Get someone.

28:50.526 --> 28:52.045
I have to get up!

28:52.046 --> 28:55.206
Oh... Sid! Sid!

28:58.166 --> 29:00.765
Pregnancy test results
just came through.

29:00.766 --> 29:02.205
Negative.

29:02.206 --> 29:04.605
The whole thing was
a delaying tactic,

29:04.606 --> 29:07.805
while her boyfriend tried
to concoct new "evidence".

29:07.806 --> 29:11.725
Wilfred Fernsley probably caught him
at it and that's why he had to die.

29:11.726 --> 29:13.725
Speculation.

29:13.726 --> 29:15.965
She's played you
like a fiddle, Father.

29:15.966 --> 29:17.845
But in under an hour she'll hang.

29:17.846 --> 29:20.525
Guv, Charlie Denham's been spotted.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.846
Just down the road.

29:23.206 --> 29:26.566
And, in due course, I fully expect
her lover to follow her.

29:28.446 --> 29:31.926
Maybe you're right. Maybe Charlie
was in on it with Violet.

29:38.806 --> 29:40.286
Go home, Father.

29:50.526 --> 29:52.126
That's how they died.

30:04.686 --> 30:05.965
What does that look like?

30:05.966 --> 30:08.525
A dress.

30:08.526 --> 30:11.125
Ethel's dress.

30:11.126 --> 30:13.285
Well, it could be. You can
ask her yourself.

30:13.286 --> 30:14.846
She's in the kitchen...

30:25.686 --> 30:27.125
Where?

30:27.126 --> 30:28.485
She's in there, trust me.

30:28.486 --> 30:30.286
I had to push her in there myself.

30:35.366 --> 30:36.966
Good morning.

30:49.046 --> 30:50.766
What's he doing?

30:53.006 --> 30:55.085
Ethel, your evidence about Violet.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.285
Take it back.

30:57.286 --> 30:58.445
What?

30:58.446 --> 31:00.406
An innocent woman is about to hang.

31:01.686 --> 31:04.205
Your evidence about
the water trough, take it back.

31:04.206 --> 31:06.445
She's not innocent!

31:06.446 --> 31:07.726
No?

31:09.126 --> 31:11.925
Well, from where I'm sitting,
which is the level at which you sit,

31:11.926 --> 31:14.845
there is no way that you could see
the water trough across the yard.

31:14.846 --> 31:16.406
I don't understand.

31:18.766 --> 31:21.045
You're lying, take it back.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.565
There was blood on her hands.

31:23.566 --> 31:24.926
I swear it!

31:28.606 --> 31:30.085
Then, in that case,

31:30.086 --> 31:33.846
the only possible
explanation is that you...

31:35.086 --> 31:36.445
can stand unaided.

31:36.446 --> 31:39.166
Pfff! And people say I'M daft!

31:41.846 --> 31:45.965
I wanted to ask you who would
have access to your old clothes,

31:45.966 --> 31:50.205
who could've stuffed the flue
and poisoned the workers.

31:50.206 --> 31:53.885
But, of course,
the most obvious answer...

31:53.886 --> 31:55.325
is you.

31:55.326 --> 31:57.485
What? Father!

31:57.486 --> 31:59.205
This is poppycock!

31:59.206 --> 32:01.045
And if you stuffed the flue

32:01.046 --> 32:03.765
and asphyxiated the workers,

32:03.766 --> 32:06.085
then you

32:06.086 --> 32:08.845
killed your son Wilf

32:08.846 --> 32:13.125
before he could take the evidence
to Inspector Sullivan.

32:13.126 --> 32:15.285
Ma, tell him, that's ridiculous!

32:15.286 --> 32:19.405
Well, we'll see
how ridiculous it is

32:19.406 --> 32:22.005
when I ask the Inspector

32:22.006 --> 32:26.125
to compare the fingerprints
in the van with yours.

32:26.126 --> 32:27.926
The ones on the steering wheel.

32:32.046 --> 32:33.286
Aaargh!

32:40.846 --> 32:42.605
Oh!

32:42.606 --> 32:45.125
Archie, you stay with
Lady Felicia, here.

32:45.126 --> 32:46.726
Sid, come with me.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.406
Ow!

32:56.406 --> 32:57.606
There she is!

33:40.646 --> 33:42.286
Go on, go on!

33:45.086 --> 33:48.245
Well, we can't just
stay clinging here

33:48.246 --> 33:49.885
waiting for someone
to save our bacon.

33:49.886 --> 33:51.765
Violet hasn't got time for this.

33:51.766 --> 33:53.526
All right, here goes nothing.

33:58.006 --> 33:59.525
Explain to me, Father,

33:59.526 --> 34:01.325
in case I should fall to my death.

34:01.326 --> 34:03.725
If Ethel could walk,
why would she pretend

34:03.726 --> 34:05.366
for so many years that she can't?

34:07.646 --> 34:09.525
Some people fake chronic illness.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.165
Why?

34:11.166 --> 34:13.005
It's a psychological condition.

34:13.005 --> 34:15.445
It's an illness itself.

34:15.446 --> 34:18.925
They crave attention from
doctors, hospitals, their family.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.804
But why would you kill your own son?

34:20.806 --> 34:22.324
And that Piotr?

34:22.326 --> 34:24.565
Because they were
threatening her facade.

34:26.005 --> 34:28.485
Piotr was helping Violet
to escape from her marriage,

34:28.485 --> 34:31.245
which meant Ethel would've
lost her household slave.

34:31.246 --> 34:33.605
And Wilf was going to
the police with evidence

34:33.606 --> 34:35.885
that the workers had been killed.

34:35.886 --> 34:37.965
And what about the workers?
Why kill them?

34:37.966 --> 34:41.446
They saw her out of bed.
They would have told her sons.

34:43.926 --> 34:44.966
Oh!

34:48.726 --> 34:49.966
Come on, piggies!

34:51.606 --> 34:53.165
Come on! It's not going to work.

34:53.166 --> 34:54.764
What you doing?

34:54.766 --> 34:57.366
Argh... Err...

35:17.206 --> 35:18.566
I hate pigs!

35:28.846 --> 35:30.565
Take a statement from Mrs Fernsley.

35:30.566 --> 35:32.765
But be gentle, she's in shock.

35:32.766 --> 35:34.805
I'll be questioning Officer Denham.

35:34.806 --> 35:36.165
Inspector!

35:36.166 --> 35:38.925
You have to find Ethel Fernsley.
She's the killer..

35:38.926 --> 35:40.805
If this is a stunt...

35:40.806 --> 35:44.045
You have to find her now.
You have to stop the execution.

35:44.046 --> 35:46.766
I'm leaving now, Father.
No more diversions!

35:48.126 --> 35:50.886
If Ethel's the murderer,
then I'm the next pope!

35:58.606 --> 35:59.965
Stay where you are!

35:59.966 --> 36:01.605
No! Get off me!

36:01.606 --> 36:03.925
You brute! She did it!

36:03.926 --> 36:06.965
She killed my Ivan!

36:06.966 --> 36:09.685
Ethel Fernsley, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

36:09.686 --> 36:12.445
You are not obliged to say anything,
unless you wish to do so.

36:12.446 --> 36:13.526
Get off me!

36:15.246 --> 36:18.166
Get your filthy hands off me!

36:19.246 --> 36:20.766
If you ever need me...

36:23.926 --> 36:27.645
You dirty lie...
Don't you touch me, you pig!

36:27.646 --> 36:29.445
I hope you rot in hell!

36:29.446 --> 36:30.965
Thank you.

36:30.966 --> 36:35.605
Well. It would be ungracious of me
not to offer my congratulations.

36:35.606 --> 36:37.566
I imagine you'll be celebrating.

36:39.326 --> 36:42.765
Well, I'm pleased that Violet
and Charlie will be released.

36:42.766 --> 36:45.965
But Ethel is facing
a death sentence.

36:45.966 --> 36:48.085
So, nothing to celebrate there.

36:48.086 --> 36:50.485
Even for a self-confessed
mass murderer?

36:50.486 --> 36:53.325
Has she admitted everything?
She's admitted enough.

36:53.326 --> 36:55.286
We only needed one to send her down.

36:57.486 --> 37:02.046
So, which ones hasn't
she confessed to?

37:09.366 --> 37:10.966
Father?

37:11.966 --> 37:13.126
Father?

37:18.246 --> 37:20.645
I told you
you were going to marry us.

37:20.646 --> 37:23.805
We're here to set the date.
The sooner the better.

37:23.806 --> 37:27.246
Well, I'll get Mrs McCarthy
to consult the parish diary.

37:29.126 --> 37:33.405
Violet, before you marry,
you should make your confession.

37:33.406 --> 37:36.445
Actually, I've been meaning to.

37:36.446 --> 37:37.925
Are you free now?

37:37.926 --> 37:39.686
Now is as good a time as any.

37:41.246 --> 37:43.326
I'll leave you alone.

37:47.846 --> 37:49.845
This marriage.

37:49.846 --> 37:51.645
Is it what you really want?

37:51.646 --> 37:53.125
Of course.

37:53.126 --> 37:57.245
You're not doing it out of gratitude
or guilt, you do truly love him?

37:57.246 --> 37:58.966
More than anything.

38:02.926 --> 38:07.006
Only you still seem to carry
a shadow with you.

38:08.926 --> 38:10.966
I'm finally happy, Father.

38:12.806 --> 38:14.565
Trouble is,

38:14.566 --> 38:15.966
I don't deserve it.

38:17.446 --> 38:19.566
God has given me happiness.

38:20.606 --> 38:22.446
Is it wrong to enjoy it?

38:33.726 --> 38:36.245
Pray, Father, give your blessing,
for I have sinned.

38:36.246 --> 38:38.325
It's been three days
since my last confession.

38:38.326 --> 38:39.806
Go on, my child.

38:41.046 --> 38:42.446
I have...

38:44.206 --> 38:46.366
made false representation.

38:48.286 --> 38:49.925
You have lied?

38:49.926 --> 38:51.526
To you, Father.

38:52.646 --> 38:55.246
I have broken a commandment.

38:56.406 --> 38:58.006
Tell me.

38:59.646 --> 39:01.846
I killed my husband, Father.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.326
I know.

39:05.966 --> 39:08.045
But it needed to be said,

39:08.046 --> 39:10.405
for God's ears, not mine.

39:10.406 --> 39:12.405
How did you know?

39:12.406 --> 39:14.726
Ethel's evidence against you.

39:15.766 --> 39:19.045
She'd refused to back down,
even when it proved that

39:19.046 --> 39:20.805
she wasn't handicapped.

39:20.806 --> 39:23.685
And then, when I found out that

39:23.686 --> 39:25.885
Ivan's death was the only one

39:25.886 --> 39:27.365
she didn't confess to.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.246
Why didn't you hand me in?

39:31.366 --> 39:35.926
Facing death did not convince you
to seek peace with God.

39:36.926 --> 39:40.725
But looking forward to a life of...

39:40.726 --> 39:43.805
perhaps undeserved happiness

39:43.806 --> 39:46.006
has brought you closer to him.

39:47.006 --> 39:48.646
I did a terrible thing.

39:49.966 --> 39:53.045
But Ivan was a terrible man.

39:53.046 --> 39:55.286
I didn't deserve to die for it.

39:56.566 --> 39:58.966
I know how savagely he beat you.

40:01.366 --> 40:05.325
When I said I was innocent,
Father, I meant it.

40:05.326 --> 40:06.806
And Charlie?

40:07.886 --> 40:09.366
Does he know the truth?

40:10.526 --> 40:11.926
No.

40:15.286 --> 40:18.845
If you think that Charlie
wouldn't marry you

40:18.846 --> 40:20.806
if he knew what you'd done...

40:22.126 --> 40:25.846
how can you marry him
while keeping him in the dark?

40:27.366 --> 40:30.645
Father, God has given me back
my life back for a reason.

40:30.646 --> 40:32.885
I agree.

40:32.886 --> 40:35.325
Father, I love him.

40:35.326 --> 40:38.086
You have to marry us, please!

40:39.766 --> 40:41.366
Of course I'll marry you!

40:42.566 --> 40:46.446
I'll do whatever you think
is the right thing.

40:55.886 --> 40:59.086
Father Brown, do the honours!

41:04.846 --> 41:06.765
Ta-da!

41:06.766 --> 41:09.806
See, I caught him in the end, Father.
Hunted him down.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.085
I don't know what to say.

41:14.086 --> 41:15.245
I do.

41:15.246 --> 41:17.085
It's you, can't you see?

41:17.086 --> 41:19.205
Cunning, wily.

41:19.206 --> 41:21.005
More wily than my mother, anyhow.

41:21.006 --> 41:23.285
There's not a lot of people
who can say that.

41:23.286 --> 41:25.486
Thank you, Father.

41:28.406 --> 41:31.365
Tell him to take
that thing with him!

41:31.366 --> 41:34.045
I'm not going to look
a gift fox in the mouth.

41:34.046 --> 41:35.366
Was that...

41:36.486 --> 41:39.605
Oh! That's actually
a good likeness.

41:39.606 --> 41:42.525
I must dash.
I'm just dropping this by.

41:42.526 --> 41:44.645
Would you? Oh... Thank you.

41:44.646 --> 41:47.806
A first edition of
my published novella.

41:51.526 --> 41:53.005
Well, I'm flattered.

41:53.006 --> 41:54.565
I shall look forward to reading

41:54.566 --> 41:57.005
the investigations
of Reverend Green.

41:57.006 --> 41:59.525
I got the telephone call
just after Ethel's story

41:59.526 --> 42:00.845
appeared in the paper.

42:00.846 --> 42:04.125
My blow to the head in
the pursuit of justice

42:04.126 --> 42:05.885
was the icing on the cake.

42:05.886 --> 42:08.366
They offered me a publishing deal.

42:09.366 --> 42:10.886
Only cost Â£100!

42:12.406 --> 42:14.605
Would it be very unchristian of me

42:14.606 --> 42:18.046
to mention that they are
supposed to pay her?

42:19.046 --> 42:21.645
Oh! Now, Father,
if I'm not mistaken,

42:21.646 --> 42:23.365
there's somewhere you need to be.

42:23.366 --> 42:25.085
Would you?

42:25.086 --> 42:26.486
Father.

42:27.686 --> 42:30.325
Shouldn't you be... dressed,
or something?

42:30.326 --> 42:31.726
Come inside.

42:48.366 --> 42:49.765
I don't understand.

42:49.766 --> 42:52.205
I'm sorry. She's not coming.

42:52.206 --> 42:54.605
But she has to, she promised.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.965
She loves me. I know.

42:56.966 --> 42:59.286
Charlie, she must have her reasons.

43:00.326 --> 43:02.645
Where is she? I'll talk her round.

43:02.646 --> 43:04.845
Get your things on,
you're going to marry us.

43:04.846 --> 43:07.445
Maybe later than we thought,
but you will.

43:07.446 --> 43:09.046
That might be difficult.

43:10.406 --> 43:12.125
Why?

43:12.126 --> 43:13.286
Where is she?

43:15.526 --> 43:17.646
Violet has asked me to tell you...

43:19.366 --> 43:22.926
that God has given her her life
back for a reason.
