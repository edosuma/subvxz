D-ohhh!

Aaahh!

01:18.960 --> 01:20.090
y, Mom.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.130
If we don't get to
the convention soon,

01:21.190 --> 01:22.350
all the good comics
will be gone.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.130
Aw, what do you care
about good comics?

01:24.200 --> 01:26.770
All you ever buy is
<i>Casper "The Wimpy" Ghost.</i>

01:26.830 --> 01:29.690
I think it's sad that you equate
friendliness with wimpiness,

01:29.770 --> 01:32.640
and I hope it will keep you from
ever achieving true popularity.

01:32.710 --> 01:33.980
Well you wanna know
what I think?

01:34.040 --> 01:36.410
I think Casper is
the ghost of Richie Rich.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.280
Lisa:
<i>Hey, they do look alike.</i>

01:38.340 --> 01:39.640
I wonder how Richie died?

01:39.710 --> 01:40.780
Perhaps he realized

01:40.850 --> 01:42.350
how hollow the pursuit
of money is,

01:42.410 --> 01:43.740
and took his own life.

01:43.820 --> 01:45.750
Kids, could you
lighten up a little?

01:45.820 --> 01:47.390
Now Radioactive Man, he rules!

01:47.450 --> 01:50.550
Never punches a bad guy
without saying something cool.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.080
He's no wittier
than the next superhero.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.160
Oh yeah? Look. He knocks a guy
into the sun and says

01:56.230 --> 01:57.830
"Hot enough for you?"

01:57.900 --> 01:59.330
Heh, heh, heh...

01:59.400 --> 02:00.770
I stand corrected.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.430
We're here.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.580
Too bad we
didn't come dressed

02:07.640 --> 02:09.580
as popular
cartoon characters.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.850
This looks like
a discount for...

02:11.910 --> 02:12.980
Hey!

02:13.050 --> 02:15.680
Bartman!

02:15.750 --> 02:18.050
Who are you supposed to be?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.420
I'm Bartman.

02:19.490 --> 02:21.420
Never heard of him--
full price.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.320
Lousy rip-off.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.390
Is this on?

02:25.460 --> 02:28.060
Young people of Springfield,
as your mayor

02:28.130 --> 02:31.730
I'd like to welcome you to our
annual funny book convention.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.940
And thank you for pumping almost
$300 into the local economy.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.210
Your youthful high spirits
have imparted a glow

02:39.270 --> 02:40.880
to this old war-horse.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.210
You might say I feel like

02:43.280 --> 02:44.550
Radiation Man.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.710
That's "Radioactive Man," jerk.

02:46.780 --> 02:47.750
( <i>laughing )</i>

02:47.810 --> 02:49.610
I, uh... stand corrected.

02:49.680 --> 02:54.120
Well, have fun and be sure
to clear out by 6:00
for the Shriners.

02:54.190 --> 02:55.460
Get that punk's name.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.460
No one makes a fool out of
Diamond Joe Quimby.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.880
Excuse me, sir.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.830
Has anyone turned in
a left Vulcan ear?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.220
Well, let's see.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.500
We got a utility belt,
a couple of tricorders

03:06.570 --> 03:07.840
a light sabre...

03:07.900 --> 03:08.970
Sorry, kid.

03:09.030 --> 03:12.160
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.440
Nhh-mm.

03:14.940 --> 03:16.210
Hey, Bart dude.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.480
Hey, Otto man.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.870
Ooh, what's that?

03:18.940 --> 03:21.470
My very own idea
for a comic book, little man.

03:21.550 --> 03:24.450
It's about a dude
who drives a school bus by day

03:24.520 --> 03:28.720
but by night, fights vampires
in a post-apocalyptic war zone.

03:28.790 --> 03:29.720
Cool!

03:29.790 --> 03:30.960
Come on, Bart.

03:31.020 --> 03:33.020
We're going to see
Buddy Hodges.

03:33.090 --> 03:35.700
The guy who played
Fallout Boy on TV?
Yep!

03:35.760 --> 03:38.670
Wow! I guess he
<i>wasn't killed in Vietnam.</i>

03:38.730 --> 03:42.170
Ahh, these Laramie cigarettes

03:42.230 --> 03:45.600
give me the steady nerves
I need to combat evil.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.610
Gee willickers,
Radioactive Man.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.130
Wished I was old enough
to smoke Laramies.

03:49.210 --> 03:50.180
Sorry, Fallout Boy.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.850
Not until you're 16.

03:51.910 --> 03:53.050
Look out!

03:54.580 --> 03:56.880
Announcer:
<i>Will Radioactive Man</i>

03:56.950 --> 03:58.590
<i>act in time to save the Earth?</i>

03:58.650 --> 04:00.890
( <i>kids cheering )</i>

04:00.950 --> 04:02.910
Well, wasn't that great?

04:02.990 --> 04:05.760
You know kids, I'm sure
we'd all like to remember
actor Dirk Richter

04:05.820 --> 04:08.290
for his portrayal
of Radioactive Man

04:08.360 --> 04:11.300
and not the sordid details
of his final years

04:11.360 --> 04:14.260
so let's keep the questions
tasteful, okay?

04:14.330 --> 04:18.130
Now, how about a big welcome for
Buddy "Fallout Boy" Hodges!

04:18.200 --> 04:20.200
( <i>kids cheering )</i>

04:20.269 --> 04:22.140
Any questions?

04:22.210 --> 04:25.450
When Radioactive Man got
injected with shrinking serum
in issue 234,

04:25.510 --> 04:27.420
how come his costume
shrinks too?

04:27.480 --> 04:28.950
I'm sure I don't know

04:29.010 --> 04:31.840
but I did just finish playing
Rum Tum Tugger

04:31.920 --> 04:34.660
in the second national
touring company of <i>Cats.
Anybody see it?</i>

04:34.720 --> 04:36.820
Oh, oh, over here,
Fallout Boy! Me, me me!

04:36.890 --> 04:38.430
Yes, you.
The masked boy.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.460
Do you think the ghost
of Dirk Richter haunts
the bordello

04:40.530 --> 04:43.200
where his bullet-riddled body
was found?

04:43.260 --> 04:45.970
( <i>crying: )
Dirk Richter
was a beautiful man.</i>

04:46.030 --> 04:48.670
Can't you little vultures
leave him alone?!

04:53.140 --> 04:56.440
Hey! <i>Radioactive Man #72!</i>

04:56.510 --> 04:58.250
It's an imaginary tale

04:58.310 --> 05:01.280
where Radioactive Man
marries Larva Girl.

05:01.350 --> 05:03.150
Bart:
<i>Wow, number nine!</i>

05:03.220 --> 05:04.950
That's before
Fallout Boy
became his ward.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.250
Tell you what.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.760
I'll show you something
very special

05:08.820 --> 05:12.790
if you promise to put your
grubby little hands behind
your back and keep 'em there.

05:12.860 --> 05:14.160
Behold!

05:14.230 --> 05:17.700
Wow! <i>Radioactive Man
Number One.</i>

05:17.760 --> 05:18.690
<i>None other.</i>

05:18.760 --> 05:19.660
I bet it's worth
a million bucks.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.200
It is, my lad.

05:21.270 --> 05:24.010
But I'll let you have it for 100
because you remind me of me.

05:24.070 --> 05:26.010
Oh, all I got is 30.

05:26.070 --> 05:27.010
Then you cannot have it.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.530
But I must.

05:28.610 --> 05:31.210
Until this moment, I never knew
why God put me on this Earth

05:31.280 --> 05:34.220
but now I know--
to buy that comic book.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.880
Your emotion is
out of place here, son.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.780
( <i>horns honking )</i>

05:39.920 --> 05:42.160
So, did you kids
have fun?

05:42.220 --> 05:44.930
Yeah Mom. Guess what?
For a dollar, a man
sold me 35 <i>Caspers</i>

05:44.990 --> 05:46.830
and a dozen <i>Lois Lanes.</i>

05:46.890 --> 05:49.530
Ooh.
I never knew what
Superman saw in her.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.070
Give me Wonder Woman!

05:51.130 --> 05:52.730
( <i>lecherous growl )</i>

05:52.800 --> 05:56.740
And that golden lariat--
she can tie me up anytime.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.270
( <i>barking and howling )</i>

06:00.340 --> 06:01.310
Homer!

06:01.370 --> 06:02.770
I was just kidding, Marge.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.780
Hey! What does everyone say
to dinner at Krusty Burgers?

06:06.850 --> 06:08.350
( <i>cheering )
My treat.</i>

06:08.410 --> 06:11.240
Alright Homer!
Woah, you really are
a sport, Dad

06:11.320 --> 06:12.520
taking us out
to a fine restaurant

06:12.580 --> 06:13.950
like Krusty Burger.

06:14.020 --> 06:15.590
Alright, what are you
getting at?

06:15.650 --> 06:17.980
I need $100
for a comic book.

06:18.060 --> 06:20.290
100 bucks? For a comic book?
Who drew it,
Michael Malangelo?

06:20.360 --> 06:24.030
Oh please Dad. I want this more
than anything in the world.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.900
Well, T.S.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.330
Please, Dad...
No.
Please, Dad...
No.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.010
Please, Dad...
No... No...
Please, Dad...

06:31.070 --> 06:32.010
Please, Dad...
No... <i>no!
Please, Dad...</i>

06:32.070 --> 06:33.810
No!!
Now look, son.

06:33.870 --> 06:36.830
We all know that usually
when you bug me like this,
I give in

06:36.910 --> 06:38.280
so I'm not mad at you
for trying--

06:38.340 --> 06:40.810
shows you've been
paying attention--

06:40.880 --> 06:43.620
but we all know
I'm not gonna give you $100.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.520
Now are you going
to stop bugging me?

06:45.580 --> 06:47.280
No... no...
Are you?...
are you?...

06:47.350 --> 06:48.950
Are you?...
are you?...
No... no...

06:49.020 --> 06:50.490
No... no...
Are you?...
are you?...

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
Okay!!

06:51.620 --> 06:53.220
Hee-hee! I win!

06:53.290 --> 06:54.630
In your face!

06:54.690 --> 06:56.820
Yeah! How do you
like them apples?

06:56.900 --> 06:57.870
Hoo-hoo!

06:57.930 --> 06:59.130
Don't gloat, Homer.

07:00.470 --> 07:03.140
You know Bart,
when I was your age

07:03.200 --> 07:04.970
the one thing I wanted
more than anything in the world,

07:05.040 --> 07:06.940
was a child-size,
electric-light bulb oven.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.310
My parents wouldn't
give me the money

07:08.370 --> 07:10.500
so I went to my sisters,
Patty and Selma.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.280
We'll give you
half our allowance.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.570
Uh-huh, but you have
to be our slave.

07:14.650 --> 07:15.980
Okay.

07:16.050 --> 07:17.920
This gives us a
lot more free time.
Uh-huh!

07:17.980 --> 07:19.940
Let's take up smoking.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.160
<i>For months I worked and worked</i>

07:22.220 --> 07:24.590

smoked and smoked.</i>

♪ Venus ♪

07:28.160 --> 07:31.270
♪ Oh, Venus... ♪

07:31.330 --> 07:34.370
We want those dress shields
hand-washed

07:34.430 --> 07:36.760

07:36.840 --> 07:38.810
<i>But the big day finally came</i>

07:38.870 --> 07:41.440
<i>and because I'd worked for it</i>

07:41.510 --> 07:45.280
<i>all those lightbulb-warmed
treats always tasted
extra good.</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:47.510
So maybe a part-time job
is the answer.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.950
Oh Mom, I couldn't ask you
to do that.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.750
You already take care
of Maggie, and Lisa is
such a handful.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.820
Lisa:

No, not today.

Seeing how it's
a first offense...

09:42.510 --> 09:44.580
I guess we can
overlook this.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.950
So long, officers.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.320
Uh-oh.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.010
Hey, what's all the..?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.120
( <i>screams )</i>

09:51.190 --> 09:52.960
My beer! My beer!

09:53.020 --> 09:55.060
My beautiful beer!

09:55.120 --> 09:58.190
Marge:
The poor boy is so desperate.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.500
He wants to earn money
to buy a comic book.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.360
A comic book?

10:03.430 --> 10:05.400
Oh, my.
Boys never change.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.970
Which one is it,
<i>Nazi Smasher?</i>

10:08.040 --> 10:09.570
I don't think so.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.910
Send him over
to my house.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.370
I got a few chores
he can do.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.070
He knows how to mix whitewash,
don't he?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.250
( <i>crows cawing )</i>

10:18.310 --> 10:20.370
Mrs. Glick?

10:20.450 --> 10:22.390
You must be
Bert Simpson.

10:22.450 --> 10:25.820
You look like you got
a strong, young back.

10:25.890 --> 10:28.860
Would you like
something to eat?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.950
I got dried apricots,
almond paste

10:32.030 --> 10:33.600
sauerkraut candy.

10:33.660 --> 10:34.930
No, thanks.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.270
Who's that?

10:36.330 --> 10:38.340
Oh, that's
my brother Esa.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.810
He was killed
in the great war.

10:40.870 --> 10:43.610
Held a grenade too long.

10:44.670 --> 10:47.170
This one's for you, Kaiser Bill.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.210
Special delivery from
Uncle Sam and all the boys
in "D" company--

10:50.280 --> 10:52.950
Yeah, Johnny, Harrison,
Brooklyn Bob and Reggie.

10:53.010 --> 10:55.510
Yeah, even Reggie.

10:55.580 --> 10:56.510
He ain't so stuck up
once you get to..

10:56.590 --> 10:58.890
( <i>explosion )</i>

10:58.950 --> 11:00.010
( <i>gulp )</i>

11:00.090 --> 11:02.360
Here, have
some ribbon candy.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.850
Boys <i>love candy.</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:04.930
No, thanks.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.250
Boys love candy!

11:06.330 --> 11:07.530
Eww!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.270
I think I'd rather
just get to work, ma'am.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.540
We'll start with a little
light yard work,

11:11.600 --> 11:14.710
and when you're done,
you can have a nice barley pop.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.840
I want you to clear out
all the weeds.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.480
You do know
which ones are weeds?

11:20.540 --> 11:21.810
All of them?

11:21.880 --> 11:22.880
Good boy.

11:22.940 --> 11:25.470
Now be careful
with these.

11:25.550 --> 11:28.890
I'll be inside
watching my stories.

11:28.950 --> 11:29.990
( <i>grunting )</i>

11:31.950 --> 11:33.710
Ow!

11:33.790 --> 11:36.860
Ow! Ooh!

11:36.930 --> 11:38.430
Jack, please.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.990
I'm married.

11:40.060 --> 11:42.400
That must be
what's turning me on.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.260
<i>Oh, stop it...
some more.</i>

11:45.330 --> 11:46.930
Filthy...

11:47.000 --> 11:49.770
but genuinely arousing.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.940
Finished.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.480
Merciful heavens!

11:52.540 --> 11:53.840
You're bleeding.

11:53.910 --> 11:55.650
I'll get the iodine.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.650
( <i>mumbling: )
Now, let's see....</i>

11:57.710 --> 11:59.610
bunion pad... liver...

11:59.680 --> 12:00.750
iodine.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.190
Now don't fidget.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.020
Listen, lady,
you don't have...

12:04.090 --> 12:05.390
( <i>long scream )</i>

12:05.450 --> 12:08.820
Mrs. Glick:
<i>They never improved on iodine.</i>

12:08.890 --> 12:09.960
Hi, Mom.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.030
Did you make any money?

12:12.090 --> 12:14.490
Not yet, but at least
I'm in a lot of pain.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.630
Well, I think what you're doing
for Mrs. Glick is very nice.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.970
Poor old thing
doesn't have anybody.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.610
There's a reason.

12:21.670 --> 12:24.340
The sludge
certainly collects

12:24.410 --> 12:27.650
around those downspouts,
don't it?

12:27.710 --> 12:30.180
I'll sludge you, you old bat.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.020
Today, we wash Beulah.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.050
You know what that is?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.420
Some old lady thing
nobody's heard about
for fifty years?

12:36.480 --> 12:37.950
No.

12:38.020 --> 12:40.760
It was my wedding dress.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.580
But then I dyed it black

12:43.660 --> 12:46.200
and it became
my mourning dress.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.730
Great story, lady.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.670
Last night I dreamed
I held you in my arms.

12:58.740 --> 13:01.010
( <i>cat growling )</i>

13:01.080 --> 13:02.650
( <i>yowling )</i>

13:02.710 --> 13:04.180
No, no,
not the iodine!

13:04.250 --> 13:06.420
Burn the germs off
with a torch

13:06.480 --> 13:08.550
amputate my arm,
but not the...

13:08.620 --> 13:11.260
( <i>screaming )</i>

13:11.320 --> 13:12.890
Well, it's payday.

13:12.950 --> 13:16.580
I'll wager you've been
looking forward to this.

13:16.660 --> 13:17.800
Oh, yes, ma'am.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.630
Here we are--
two quarters.

13:19.690 --> 13:20.960
Two quarters?

13:21.030 --> 13:22.770
You deserve every penny.

13:22.830 --> 13:26.700
You know, I've told a lot
of my girlfriends about you

13:26.770 --> 13:28.670
and they have chores too.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.210
<i>Two quarters?</i>

13:30.270 --> 13:33.010
Bart, you didn't
say thank you.

13:33.070 --> 13:36.000
Listen lady, I can leave
without screaming,

13:36.080 --> 13:37.280
and I can leave
without saying a bad word.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.080
But there is no way
that I am saying thank you.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.420
You're welcome.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.140
All right then, off you go

13:44.220 --> 13:47.460
to spend it on penny whistles
and Moon Pies.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.630
( <i>door slams )</i>

13:48.690 --> 13:50.090
Bart:
<i>Moon Pies, my butt.</i>

13:50.160 --> 13:51.730
<i>Somebody ought
to Moon-Pie her.</i>

13:51.790 --> 13:53.320
What's the problem, boy?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.800
I been bustin' my hump all week
for that withered old clam

13:55.860 --> 13:57.830
and all I got was 50¢.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.800
Hey, when I was your age,
50¢ was a lot of money.

14:00.870 --> 14:01.810
Really?

14:01.870 --> 14:03.070
Nah.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.010
Dad, I've done
everything I could

14:05.070 --> 14:06.900
and I've only got 35 bucks.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.750
I am through with working.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.510
Working is for chumps.

14:10.580 --> 14:11.920
Son, I'm proud
of you.

14:11.980 --> 14:15.090
I was twice your age
before I figured that out.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.390
( <i>gasps )</i>

14:20.460 --> 14:22.090
Can you let me have it
for $40?

14:22.160 --> 14:24.800
40 bucks? Forget it.
You made me get off
my stool for that?

14:24.860 --> 14:26.330
It's all I've got.

14:26.390 --> 14:27.590
I sold seeds.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.020
I visited my aunt
in the nursing home.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.070
I fished a dime out
of the sewer, for God's sake!

14:33.130 --> 14:34.060
No way.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.410
What do you want?

14:35.470 --> 14:37.110
Can I have it for 35?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.480
No! No. Freaking kid.
I do not need this.

14:39.540 --> 14:42.910
I've got a Masters
in Folklore and Mythology.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.420
Do you have the
Carl Yastrzemski
baseball card from 1973,

14:45.480 --> 14:47.380
when he had big sideburns?

14:47.450 --> 14:49.320
Show me the 30 bucks

14:49.380 --> 14:51.810
because if you ain't got it,
I ain't getting off the stool.

14:51.890 --> 14:52.720
Okay.

14:53.790 --> 14:54.960
Wait a minute.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.050
Martin, if you, Milhouse
and I went in together

14:58.130 --> 15:01.830
we could buy a copy
of <i>Radioactive Man #1 right now.</i>

15:01.900 --> 15:03.200
Wow!
Wow!

15:03.260 --> 15:04.590
Here you go.
Muttonchop Yaz.
I don't want it.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.940
Freaking kids.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.640
Look pal, we
got 100 bucks

15:07.700 --> 15:10.330
and we'd like to buy
<i>Radioactive Man #1.</i>

15:10.410 --> 15:12.940
So why don't you just
waddle over there

15:13.010 --> 15:14.110
and get it!

15:14.180 --> 15:15.310
Yes, sir!

15:17.510 --> 15:18.450
Wow!

15:18.510 --> 15:20.510
Breathe it in, boys.

15:20.580 --> 15:21.650
( <i>sniffing )</i>

15:21.720 --> 15:25.260
This is the stuff
dreams are made of.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.520
It smells like my Grampa.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.130
Uh-oh, looks like rain.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.160
We better get this baby home.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.300
Uh-oh.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.290
Looks like you bought more
than you bargained for.

15:38.370 --> 15:41.340
( <i>fiendish laughter )</i>

15:45.510 --> 15:49.710
<i>My pants... caught
on barbed wire!</i>

15:49.780 --> 15:53.120
<i>Good Lord! Choke! An A-bomb!</i>

15:53.180 --> 15:56.590
<i>Yaarrgh!!</i>

15:56.650 --> 15:57.890
( <i>grunts )</i>

15:57.950 --> 16:00.910
<i>...becoming Radioactive.</i>

16:00.990 --> 16:05.060
( <i>deep, powerful voice:)
From this day forward
I shall call myself...</i>

16:05.130 --> 16:06.700
<i>Radioactive Man!</i>

16:06.760 --> 16:08.830
So that's how it happened.

16:08.900 --> 16:12.200
I would have thought
being hit by an atomic bomb
would've killed him.

16:12.270 --> 16:13.300
Now you know better.

16:13.370 --> 16:14.240
Turn the page,
Bart.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.410
Bart:
<i>Careful, careful...ah.</i>

16:23.480 --> 16:25.150
Listen, you guys
are welcome to come over

16:25.210 --> 16:26.540
and read it any time you like.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.010
Why can't we keep it
at my house?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.710
Your house?
That's crazy talk.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.050
Well the comics' ours as much
as it is yours.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.420
How about this, guys?

16:33.490 --> 16:35.960
Bart can have it
Mondays and Thursdays

16:36.020 --> 16:37.950
Milhouse will get it
Tuesdays and Fridays

16:38.030 --> 16:39.360
and yours truly will take it
Wednesdays and Saturdays.

16:39.430 --> 16:40.330
Perfect.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.700
Wait a minute.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.120
What about Sunday?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.070
Yeah. What <i>about Sunday?</i>

16:45.130 --> 16:48.960
Sunday possession will
be determined by a
random number generator.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.710
I'll have one through three,
Milhouse, four through six

16:52.770 --> 16:54.600
and Bart will have
seven through nine.
Perfect.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.110
Wait a minute.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.820
What about zero?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.850
Yeah. What <i>about zero?</i>

16:59.910 --> 17:03.540
In the unlikely event of a zero,
possession will be determined

17:03.620 --> 17:06.960
by rock, scissors, paper
competition. Best three
out of five, how's that?

17:07.020 --> 17:08.690
All right.
That's cool.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.589
Excellent.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.599
Well, today being Saturday,
gentlemen, I guess I'll be
taking my comic and...

17:13.660 --> 17:14.630
Uh-uh-uh.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.900
Nice try, Martin.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.260
It almost worked

17:17.329 --> 17:20.300
but tonight this comic book
stays right here.

17:20.369 --> 17:22.609
If the comic stays right here,
then so do I.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.210
Me too.

17:24.270 --> 17:27.280
Fine. We're all going to stay
here with the comic book.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.580
It will be like a sleep-over.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.040
Yeah, a sleep-over.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.080
That's what pals do, right?

17:32.150 --> 17:33.680
Real friendly-like.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.650
( <i>wind blowing )</i>

17:38.990 --> 17:40.560
I want to read it again.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.190
Nice try, mister.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.460
Milhouse,
The acids in your hand

17:43.520 --> 17:45.290
could damage
the newsprint.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.560
We want to keep
this comic forever

17:47.630 --> 17:49.130
so the last one alive

17:49.200 --> 17:51.940
will have the honor
of being buried with it.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.100
What do you mean,
"The last one alive"?

17:54.170 --> 17:55.410
I meant years from now.

17:55.470 --> 17:56.940
Yeah, sure you did.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.840
Bart, don't push him.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.410
I knew it--
you're both against me.

18:01.480 --> 18:06.050
Nobody makes a sap
out of Bartholomew J. Simpson.

18:06.110 --> 18:07.770
Quit it!
<i>You quit it.</i>

18:07.850 --> 18:09.350
No, <i>you quit it.</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:13.750
( <i>all choking )</i>

18:13.820 --> 18:15.330
I thought you boys

18:15.390 --> 18:18.330
might like some milk
and microwave s'mores.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.690
( <i>gasping: )
Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.</i>

18:20.760 --> 18:21.730
Thanks, Mom.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.570
Sweet dreams, boys.

18:23.630 --> 18:26.300
( <i>all crunching )</i>

18:28.100 --> 18:30.130
( <i>thunder )</i>

18:39.310 --> 18:42.410
One more step
and you're a dead man.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.340
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.090
Yeah right, so do I, but you
don't see <i>me getting up.</i>

18:47.160 --> 18:48.730
What's going on?

18:48.790 --> 18:51.160
Our dear friend Martin
was trying to steal
the comic book.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.730
Let's tie him up!

18:52.790 --> 18:55.490
( <i>thunder )</i>

18:55.560 --> 18:56.820
Bart, is this how you treat
all your guests?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.570
Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an
apple in your mouth.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.890
We can't take any chances.
We'll have to take turns
watching him.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.140
Okay. I'll go first.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.400
Ah! So that's your little game.

19:05.470 --> 19:07.900
Let old Bart get nice and drowsy

19:07.980 --> 19:10.310
then when his back
is turned, <i>wham!</i>

19:10.380 --> 19:12.420
Well, it
will not happen, see?

19:12.480 --> 19:13.920
You're going crazy.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.550
I'm telling your Mom.

19:15.620 --> 19:16.450
Hey Martin, tell him
what we do with squealers.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.520
I don't know. Is it worse than

19:18.590 --> 19:20.660
what you do with people
who have to go to the bathroom?

19:20.720 --> 19:21.930
You can't stop me.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.330
The hell I can't.

19:24.390 --> 19:25.700
( <i>both grunting )</i>

19:27.500 --> 19:29.630
Marge:
It's really
coming down.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.570
Could you check
on the boys?

19:34.840 --> 19:35.870
They're fine.

19:42.110 --> 19:43.050
Whoa!
Yeow!

19:45.080 --> 19:46.380
Bart! The comic!

19:48.050 --> 19:50.050
Don't let go of me, Bart!

19:50.120 --> 19:52.890
Milhouse, it's not that far
to the ground.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.980
The rain's probably
softened it up a bit.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.560
No, Bart, no!

19:59.630 --> 20:01.670
If you guys
hadn't tied me up

20:01.730 --> 20:03.530
I could be saving
the comic as we speak.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.600
Shut up... shut up!

20:05.670 --> 20:06.800
Help me, Bart.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.870
I didn't even want the comic.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.680
I wanted Carl Yastrzemski
with the big sideburns.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.280
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:15.340 --> 20:16.440
( <i>ripping )</i>

20:22.220 --> 20:23.250
( <i>sighs )</i>

20:27.890 --> 20:29.830
( <i>growling )</i>

20:29.890 --> 20:31.090
( <i>gasping )</i>

20:31.160 --> 20:32.930
( <i>thunder clap )</i>

20:34.530 --> 20:37.170
( <i>groaning )</i>

20:37.230 --> 20:39.500
Boys, you better
come in the house.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.770
You don't want
to get the sniffles.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.970
Oh, Mom.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.510
Now come on.

20:44.570 --> 20:48.010
Hmm. You can play your
little tie-up game inside.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.350
I've got some cocoa
on the stove.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.480
Who wants
imitation marshmallows?

20:52.550 --> 20:54.080
I do!
I do!

20:54.150 --> 20:56.220
I'd raise my hand,
Mrs. Simpson,
if I could.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.360
( <i>birds chirping )</i>

21:00.420 --> 21:01.530
( <i>yawning )</i>

21:04.030 --> 21:05.130
D-ohhh!

21:05.190 --> 21:07.520
It's no use, fellas.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.870
Another comic book

21:08.930 --> 21:12.170
has returned to the Earth
from whence it came.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.030
We worked so hard
and now it's all gone.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.800
We ended up
with nothing

21:16.870 --> 21:19.080
because the three of us
can't share.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.480
What's your point?

21:20.540 --> 21:23.050
Nothing. Just kind of
ticks me off.

21:27.450 --> 21:31.490
Radioactive Man:
<i>Well, the world is safe again</i>

21:31.550 --> 21:34.350
<i>but... for how long?</i>
