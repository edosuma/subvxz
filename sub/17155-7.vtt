<i>Previously on</i> Jonas LA...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.375
Mona wants me to kiss Vanessa today
during the shoot.

00:04.458 --> 00:06.709
-How do you feel about that?
-Good.

00:07.792 --> 00:10.458
It was hard because I didn't
want to watch you kiss her.

00:10.542 --> 00:13.000
We're not dating
and you're dating somebody else.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.959
Yeah, Ben.

00:15.041 --> 00:16.333
He just asked me out!

00:16.417 --> 00:17.583
-He's cute.
-I know.

00:17.667 --> 00:20.417
We should be able
to date whoever we want

00:20.500 --> 00:23.208
without the other one of us
freaking out about it.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.750
-I agree.
-Let's go on a date.

00:27.208 --> 00:29.000
That sounds really nice.

00:31.291 --> 00:34.041
OK, here's the plan:
Joe, down and out to the right,

00:34.125 --> 00:35.625
Nick, buttonhook to the left.
Break.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.333
[Macy] You know, Stella,
this is a great opportunity

00:38.417 --> 00:40.583
to observe boys
in their natural habitat.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.166
And get a tan at the same time.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.834
[laughs]
Oh, you did not say tan!

00:46.917 --> 00:49.375
Remember the tan ban? Hi.
Hands.

00:51.125 --> 00:54.166
For you and for you.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.083
And a little more for you.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.250
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Hm.

01:01.041 --> 01:03.125
OK, guys, hut one, hut two.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.333
-Over here.
-OK.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.417
-Nobody's open.
-Dude!

01:05.500 --> 01:06.458
Oh, no, here comes the blitz.

01:06.542 --> 01:07.458
-Nobody's open.
-Come on.

01:07.542 --> 01:09.667
-Over here.
-He's gonna run for it.

01:09.750 --> 01:10.792
Dude!

01:11.166 --> 01:13.625
He's at the 20. He's at the ten.
He might go--

01:13.709 --> 01:16.583
All the way!
Come on, no.

01:16.667 --> 01:20.375
Interesting. The youngest ones
seem to have attacked the eldest.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.291
You can learn much
by observing their ways.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.250
Why can't boys ever just relax?

01:24.333 --> 01:27.875
Well, they can't
express their feelings, so they do this.

01:27.959 --> 01:30.333
How do you know so much?

01:30.417 --> 01:33.000
I've lived among them for years.
I have brothers.

01:34.875 --> 01:36.917
[Stella]
Huh, that's fascinating.

Ben, how gorgeous is this?

02:37.083 --> 02:41.417
-Cute.
-Cute? It's genius.

02:41.500 --> 02:45.041
I mean, it's revolutionary.
It's the future of fashion.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.875
-It's a sweater.
-That's reversible.

02:50.458 --> 02:51.667
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

02:51.750 --> 02:55.709
Hey. Um, you guys,
you remember Ben, right?

02:55.792 --> 02:58.750
Of course I do. Ben.
Big Ben.

03:00.542 --> 03:01.959
Yeah, OK, let's just...

03:02.792 --> 03:07.500
-Vanessa, hi, you look amazing.
-No, you do.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.458
-Stop.
-Start.

03:09.542 --> 03:11.583
[laughing]

03:13.166 --> 03:17.000
Lightning bolt:
you two should totally join us for lunch.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.125
-Ooh--
-Really...

03:20.208 --> 03:22.917
I just kinda was hoping
it'd be the two of us.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.792
Oh, Joe, Chef Shiraki
is coming here today

03:25.875 --> 03:29.667
to prepare a very special meal for us,
so it needs to be shared with friends.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.041
Shiraki? He's, like,
the best sushi chef in the world.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.041
Oh, his sushi is totes delish.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.333
-So, you're in?
-Uh, yes!

03:38.417 --> 03:40.083
-Yeah, we're totally in.
-You are?

03:40.166 --> 03:41.834
-We are.
-Good.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.625
-Sure.
-Great.

03:44.709 --> 03:46.792
-Totes excited.
-Yay!

03:46.875 --> 03:47.917
Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.250
Um, Joe, question.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.166
Do we have enough...

03:54.166 --> 03:56.709
-Batteries?
-Yes, batteries.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.500
-We should check.
-Absolutely.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.083
Because there might be a blackout
in the middle of the day.

04:01.166 --> 04:04.333
-Which wouldn't really make sense, but--
-You know, it never hurts to check.

04:04.417 --> 04:07.000
-OK, we're checking. We'll be back.
-We'll be...

04:07.208 --> 04:08.500
[Joe]
Battery check.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.417
Batteries?
Are you kidding me?

04:13.500 --> 04:15.291
Whatever.
We only have a second.

04:15.375 --> 04:17.834
-Does Ben know that you and I were--?
-No, no!

04:18.709 --> 04:21.291
-Does Vanessa know about--
-No, no, no.

04:21.375 --> 04:24.083
Good, that's good.
We should probably keep it that way.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.166
-They don't need to know.
-They don't need to know.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.542
Shh! 'Cause everything's going
really good with me and Vanessa right now,

04:29.625 --> 04:31.333
and I don't want to complicate things.

04:31.417 --> 04:34.917
-Yeah, me too with Ben.
-Really? You guys are happy?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.875
Of course we're happy.
Why wouldn't we be happy?

04:37.959 --> 04:38.792
Do we not look happy?

04:38.875 --> 04:41.583
No, no, no, I didn't say that.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.375
Oh.
Well...

04:44.375 --> 04:45.208
We are.

04:45.583 --> 04:48.333
Great.
We should probably get back out there.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.542
-Yeah.
-Wait.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.542
Shouldn't we, like,
grab a battery or something?

04:53.625 --> 04:55.083
No!

04:56.208 --> 04:57.083
Fine.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.250
Should you guys be
doing that in the house?

05:03.333 --> 05:05.667
No, that's why we're heading
to the golf course today.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.625
Really?
Can I come with?

05:07.709 --> 05:10.750
-You know it's not miniature golf, right?
-Uh, yeah.

05:10.834 --> 05:13.834
You know there's no windmills
or castles or anything.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.041
Gotcha.
Big-boy golf.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.208
Mace, it's a lot harder than it looks.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.667
I know!
[laughs]

05:22.750 --> 05:25.291
But I just... I really
want to try and play golfing.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.875
-Yeah, play golfing.
-Please?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.208
You're so adorable, how can I say no?

05:32.959 --> 05:34.583
Thank you.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.750
I'm gonna go change
into something really cute and golfy.

05:40.417 --> 05:41.875
-Adorable.
-[chuckles]

05:43.250 --> 05:46.333
[speaks foreign language]

05:49.709 --> 05:53.166
-Oh cool.
-That means, "You guys, sushi!"

05:53.250 --> 05:54.875
Seriously.

05:54.959 --> 05:57.041
Oh, my gosh.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.750
This is so pretty.
It's like our own little sushi bar.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.750
Do not say pretty in front of Shiraki.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.959
He takes the art of sushi
very seriously.

06:04.041 --> 06:06.208
Oh, yeah, I heard he once kicked a guy
out of his restaurant

06:06.291 --> 06:07.959
for saying the word "yummy."

06:08.041 --> 06:12.000
Good to know, because we don't want
any drama at this lunch.

06:12.083 --> 06:17.208
-Right, Stella?
-Right, Joe.

06:17.291 --> 06:20.375
Shiraki-san... has arrived.

06:20.917 --> 06:24.875
Thank you for gracing us
with your time and your tuna.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.333
Oh.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.375
Sit.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.875
So, Shiraki, what's tasty?

06:33.959 --> 06:35.750
-Tasty?
-Joe!

06:35.834 --> 06:38.000
-What? I didn't say yummy.
-Yummy?!

06:38.625 --> 06:40.750
I think he just takes the last thing
anyone says and yells it.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.166
Yells it!

06:42.959 --> 06:44.625
I was just messing with you.

06:44.709 --> 06:48.583
[all laughing]

06:55.583 --> 06:57.208
Enough laughter!

06:57.875 --> 06:59.792
-Sushi time.
-[knife thuds]

07:02.417 --> 07:03.500
[Nick] All right, so,
don't be too discouraged

07:03.583 --> 07:04.750
if you don't do that well, OK?

07:04.834 --> 07:08.792
OK. I guess I'll just watch you guys
and try to do what you do.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.959
-Isn't she--
-Yeah, adorable.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.000
All right, Nick, show us the way.

07:16.625 --> 07:20.291
OK, now if you watch closely,
he has a very specific routine.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.250
-It helps him concentrate.
-Shh.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.375
Sorry, dude.

07:27.709 --> 07:30.458
Yay, Nick!
Goody for you.

07:30.542 --> 07:33.375
Macy, golfers prefer a nice,
"Nice shot."

07:33.458 --> 07:34.917
Oh, sorry.
Nice shot.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.709
-Thank you.
-My turn.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.041
OK, fly free, fly straight.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.875
So, what is he doing?

07:43.959 --> 07:46.041
He's getting his mind
and his body to work as one.

07:46.125 --> 07:49.083
Oh.
What do they normally do?

07:52.542 --> 07:55.667
-Nice shot, Kev.
<i>-Nice shot.</i> [giggles]

07:56.208 --> 07:57.333
-All right, Mace, you're up.
-Oh.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.208
-Let's head down to the ladies' tees.
-Down here.

07:59.291 --> 08:02.000
Oh, um, why do girls
have to play over there?

08:02.083 --> 08:04.125
Well, guys are more powerful
so we have to start farther back.

08:04.208 --> 08:06.917
-Kind of even things out.
-Oh.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.500
Well, I kinda wanted to try from here.
I mean, the view is so much nicer.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.208
-Sure, sweetie, go ahead.
-OK.

08:14.917 --> 08:16.291
[exhales]

08:16.834 --> 08:18.291
Here goes nothing.

08:22.583 --> 08:25.000
-That was pretty bad.
-Yeah, we told you it was tough.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.834
-Don't be too hard on yourself.
-Thanks, guys.

08:29.792 --> 08:32.375
But at least it's a beautiful day.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.417
This is the best uni ever.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.667
And uni is?

08:49.750 --> 08:51.959
-Raw sea urchin.
-Oh.

08:52.041 --> 08:54.166
Oh, you have to try this.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.250
Ooh, mm-mm.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.792
You know, it looks like
somebody already ate that.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.875
Stella, life is a series of first bites.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.667
Yeah, Stella, try it.

09:03.750 --> 09:07.458
OK, big shot, after you.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.500
-You first.
-You first.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.083
I'll try it if you try it.

09:12.542 --> 09:15.333
Fine.
Same time.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.083
-OK.
-On three.

09:17.709 --> 09:21.250
-[both] One, two...
-Three.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.375
Mmm, it's really good.

09:27.959 --> 09:29.125
I know.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.333
Oh, we did it.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.458
-We did it.
-We did it!

09:32.542 --> 09:33.750
We did it!
[laughing]

09:34.750 --> 09:36.542
-Oh, you were nervous.
-No, you were scared.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.375
I was fine.
What are you talking about?

09:38.458 --> 09:40.959
I saw your face...
[moans]

09:43.500 --> 09:45.083
-Ben.
-Vanessa.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.208
Benny, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

09:47.291 --> 09:51.500
Thank you, honey,
for encouraging me to try new things.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.542
That's my Ben, y'all.

09:57.125 --> 09:59.417
-Uh-huh.
-Enough!

09:59.500 --> 10:01.333
Next course.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.542
-Ooh, green tea ice cream.
-Joe, no! Joe, no!

10:04.625 --> 10:07.959
That's wasabi,
Japanese mustard, super spicy.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.208
Really?
It's not that...

10:10.917 --> 10:12.834
[panting]

10:16.291 --> 10:17.625
Are you crying?

10:18.458 --> 10:20.458
I didn't think his face
could get that red.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.000
Oh, I'd do anything to get
that glow in my cheeks.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.917
Joe! Joe! Joe!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.750
-[Joe yells]
-[laughing]

10:31.000 --> 10:34.834
Ah, wasabi, it always make me laugh.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.542
-That's five for me.
-And me.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.792
I got a nine!
I beat you both.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.792
OK, for the last time:
the goal in golf

10:48.875 --> 10:51.834
is to get the ball in the hole
in the fewest number of shots.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.792
Right, like bowling.

10:55.208 --> 10:57.458
Hey, sweetie, how about
you go to the clubhouse,

10:57.542 --> 10:59.291
get a lemonade and relax?

10:59.375 --> 11:01.667
You could even drive the golf cart!

11:01.750 --> 11:04.500
That does sound like a lot of fun,
but I'm not a quitter.

11:04.583 --> 11:07.375
I mean, maybe there's something
that could help me concentrate.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.000
Like, I don't know, raise the stakes?

11:10.083 --> 11:12.000
-How?
-Like a bet.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.792
You want to bet us at golf?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.291
You're right,
that was a terrible idea.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.125
No, no, no, I want to hear
what she has to say.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.625
-Keep talking.
-Hmm, let me think.

11:22.709 --> 11:26.250
Oh, I got one. If you beat me
I'll do your laundry for a week.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.792
-I don't want to make you do that.
-I do!

11:28.875 --> 11:31.208
We haven't washed any clothes
since we've moved in.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.083
And if I win, let's say

11:33.166 --> 11:35.333
Stella and I get to live
in the main house for a week

11:35.417 --> 11:37.000
while you guys live in the guest house.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.792
Bet on.
Oh, yeah.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.291
Gracious, where did that come from?

11:58.792 --> 12:02.041
-I'm guessing you've done this before.
-Big golfing family.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.667
-Your dad taught you?
-My mom.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.792
OK, I read somewhere that
you're supposed to drink milk, so...

12:15.875 --> 12:18.291
-I'll drink anything... anything.
-It's OK.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.625
-Is that better?
-I can feel my tongue now.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.875
[laughing]
That's good, 'cause, um, you're a mess.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.917
And, um, you got a little in your hair.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.625
-What? Oh, man.
-Relax, chill out. I got it.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.875
I got it.
Come here.

12:33.709 --> 12:34.709
There you go.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.083
Back to perfect.

12:39.375 --> 12:43.083
-You rule.
-Thanks.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.375
[Ben]
Stella?

12:57.333 --> 12:58.583
This isn't what it looks like.

12:58.667 --> 13:02.250
Unless it looks like nothing's going on,
because nothing was happening.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.166
You know, you and Joe
always act weird around each other,

13:05.250 --> 13:09.709
and I let it go because you said,
"Don't worry. Everyone here is weird."

13:09.792 --> 13:10.834
And we are.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.000
Stella, you two clearly
have something going on.

13:14.083 --> 13:19.500
Look, yes, Joe and I have been
friends for a really long time.

13:19.583 --> 13:24.709
And, yes, we did sort of
try dating briefly.

13:24.750 --> 13:26.667
-Very briefly.
-Barely at all. [chuckles]

13:28.875 --> 13:30.750
And now we're back to just friends.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.291
-You know, I'm gonna go.
-Oh, Ben!

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
There's no point in us dating
until you two figure out what this is.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.250
Sorry.

13:49.125 --> 13:52.166
[door opens, closes]

13:52.250 --> 13:55.125
Well, that wasn't fun.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.375
Are you OK?

13:58.959 --> 14:02.583
Yeah.
I guess I'm supposed to feel bad.

14:03.917 --> 14:04.875
I don't.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.417
Is that good?

14:08.208 --> 14:11.709
Are you really asking me
a relationship question right now?

14:12.166 --> 14:14.333
Right.
Never mind.

14:16.959 --> 14:20.417
So, about what Ben thought
he saw back there...

14:20.834 --> 14:22.500
It was totally innocent.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.125
-Totally.
-Totally.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.417
Totally.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.291
-So, we're cool?
-Yeah.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.375
Except your girlfriend's
in the other room.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.583
Right.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.583
Mm, Joe, Stella, you finally made it back.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.250
Yep, here we are.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.792
-It's like we were never gone.
-Where's Ben?

14:47.834 --> 14:49.750
-Oh, his cat's sick.
-He wanted a burger.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.166
-Cat!
-Burger.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.250
He's eating a burger with his sick cat.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.667
Liars!

14:56.667 --> 14:58.291
OK.
OK.

14:58.375 --> 15:01.750
Um, Ben broke up with me.

15:03.792 --> 15:07.166
Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.500
Come, sit, tell me everything.

15:14.583 --> 15:18.208

is Macy "the Girl" Misa.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.041
-I think your girlfriend hustled us.
-I can't believe you said "I think."

16:41.125 --> 16:44.000
You know, I'm kinda starting
to feel bad for you guys.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.458
You are?

16:47.333 --> 16:50.542
Nah!
In your face!

16:51.750 --> 16:53.333
Still think she's adorable?

16:55.208 --> 16:56.417
You know what I think?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.834
I think that you went out with Ben
to get over someone else.

16:59.917 --> 17:00.750
[spits up]

17:00.834 --> 17:02.917
So, Shiraki-san,
you got anything else back there?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.625
I tell you when you eat.
I tell you what you eat.

17:05.709 --> 17:09.125
I tell you how you eat.
I am the boss of eating.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.542
-Dude, chill.
-Chill?!

17:11.625 --> 17:14.875
-Sorry.
-Joe, please, we're talking.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.291
So, this guy before Ben,
anyone I would know?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.500
-Well, um...
-Vanessa...

17:24.083 --> 17:27.083
-You want the truth?
-Of course.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.792
[Joe]
Before I fell for you...

17:31.125 --> 17:36.917
Stella and I... almost... were a thing.

17:38.125 --> 17:41.500
-Excuse me?
-[Stella] But, Vanessa, I promise you,

17:41.625 --> 17:43.709
it is totally over between us.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.625
-Are you mad?
-No.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.959
Are you sure you're not mad?

17:53.250 --> 17:57.333
No, no, and now that
everything is out in the open,

17:57.417 --> 17:59.625
I just need Stella
to tell me one thing.

17:59.709 --> 18:01.083
Mm-hmm.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.667
What is the deal
with Joe and his hair?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.041
-His hair?
-[Vanessa] Yeah.

18:06.125 --> 18:08.792
-What about my hair?
-You're, like, obsessed with it.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.792
-I am not!
-You kind of are.

18:11.875 --> 18:15.375
[laughs] You know what, Stella?
I'm kind of glad that you two had a thing,

18:15.458 --> 18:17.125
because now you can tell me everything.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.917
Oh, well, for starters,
he can't even walk past a mirror

18:20.000 --> 18:21.417
without stopping to stare
at himself in it.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.125
Oh, please! I once saw him
stand over a puddle for ten minutes.

18:25.208 --> 18:29.208
-[all laugh]
-Ten minutes, that's a long time.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.709
Macy, I'm sorry we teased you.
You're an incredible athlete.

18:36.792 --> 18:41.625
-And still an amazing girlfriend.
-Aww, you guys are so sweet.

18:41.709 --> 18:45.166
But you're not weaseling out of the bet.
Enjoy the guest house.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.959
-[mocking] Adorable!
-Zip it.

<i>Sayonara,</i> homies.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.125
<i>Arigato,</i> Shiraki-san.
It was an honor.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.000
Joe, would you mind walking
Shiraki-san to his hybrid?

19:05.083 --> 19:06.500
No problem.

19:09.041 --> 19:12.792
-Let me help you with that.
-Oh, could you be any sweeter?

19:16.375 --> 19:18.583
You know something, Shiraki-daki?

19:18.875 --> 19:22.041
Everybody's afraid of you,
but I gotta say you're OK.

19:22.125 --> 19:26.500
[laughs] I like to keep
my customers on their toes.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.709
Do not touch Shiraki!

19:32.125 --> 19:36.250
Thanks for this. You know, despite all
the drama, that was really fun.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.375
-So, thanks.
-Fun, right.

19:41.458 --> 19:44.000
Wow, you OK there?

19:44.792 --> 19:48.041
Here's the thing:
I liked you, Stella.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.875
I thought we could be... friends.

19:50.959 --> 19:54.750
[chuckles] I'm sorry.
I thought we were friends.

19:54.834 --> 19:58.125
You know, we had sushi,
and we made fun of Joe,

19:58.208 --> 20:00.208
the whole staring-at-the-puddle thing.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.500
Yeah, that was fake.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.208
Kinda like the way you've been faking

20:05.291 --> 20:07.417
that there's nothing
going on between you and Joe.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.875
-There is nothing between me and Joe.
-Oh, please.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.458
I know bad acting when I see it,

20:11.542 --> 20:14.250
because people always come up to me
and ask me if their kids have talent,

20:14.333 --> 20:16.834
and they never do, and I always have to
tell them that they have talent.

20:16.917 --> 20:18.041
And you know how I do that?

20:19.834 --> 20:22.417
With good acting.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.500
What are you talking about?

20:24.583 --> 20:26.667
-Just stay away from Joe.
-Or what?

20:26.750 --> 20:29.208
-Or we're gonna have a problem.
-Are you threatening me?

20:29.333 --> 20:32.083
Ah, now you're getting it!

20:33.542 --> 20:34.667
Mmm!

20:35.625 --> 20:37.834
-Did you just poke me?
-What if I did?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.709
Well, then, girlie, it would be on.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.792
-Oh, it's on.
-All right.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.834
All right, wow, I haven't been in
one of these since the fifth grade.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.166
-[Joe] Ladies!
-[Stella] Hey!

20:45.250 --> 20:46.834
Hi!

20:46.917 --> 20:50.291
-Look at you two.
-We're sharing jewelry.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.166
Oh, this would look adorbs on you.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.083
Oh, "adorbs," I love it
when you don't finish your words.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.542
It is so cool that you guys are friends.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.166
-Total besties.
-Yep, buddies.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.917
Ah, buddy.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.542
I can't believe you guys lost the house.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.834
-It's not our fault.
-We got hustled.

21:20.917 --> 21:22.500
-By Macy?
-Let's not relive it.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.041
-What do you think they're doing in there?
-Not bumping into one another.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.458
And having enough air to breathe.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.333
All right, guys,
we have a major problem:

21:28.417 --> 21:30.000
three brothers, two beds and one floor.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.667
Or a bedroom with Aunt Lisa's
cat and his litter box.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.500
There's only one way to settle this.

21:37.333 --> 21:40.125
Guys, this isn't fair.
I stink at golf.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.792
Dude, loser claims the floor.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.458
Or the cat.
Sorry, dude, we don't make the rules.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.291
Yeah, you kinda do.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.875
-What just happened?
-Yeah, you're supposed to stink.

21:52.959 --> 21:56.709
I did, but then I got some pointers
from my new golf coach.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.542
-Macy?
-Macy.

21:59.834 --> 22:01.917
Good luck fighting for the floors, boys.

22:02.166 --> 22:04.917
Oh, and the toilet brush
is underneath the sink.
