-I can make it happen.
-As much as I can get.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.166
Will your father hold up
under questioning?

00:17.250 --> 00:19.250
He's not taking my counsel
at the moment.

00:19.333 --> 00:19.750
Do you want access?

00:19.834 --> 00:22.583
Yes, I believe I do.

Fifties. Bald.

If you don't want
to get on the stand,

00:51.625 --> 00:53.917
then there needs to be
physical evidence.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.041
An item that
could speak for you.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.458
Confidence?

10:36.542 --> 10:37.709
Not even Evel Knievel
could jump the gap

10:37.792 --> 10:40.333
between what I know
and what I can prove.

10:40.417 --> 10:42.792
Then I suggest you do
what Mr. Knievel always did.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.875
Rev her high.
Pray for mercy.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.583
Try to put her down
on the ramp.

10:46.667 --> 10:47.875
And hope you are
one of the elect.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.166
Mr. Bach,
it's your motion.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.291
-Move me.
-I will.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.291
Like Brian's Song.

10:59.375 --> 11:01.709
Because like Mr. Piccolo's
sad, short life,

11:01.792 --> 11:05.375
Prosecution's case
starts off hopeful

11:05.458 --> 11:07.625
but ends
in an untimely demise.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.792
Your Honor,
to date, the government

11:09.875 --> 11:10.750
hasn't alleged
sufficient evidence

11:10.834 --> 11:13.959
that Mr. Axelrod
is guilty of any charges.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.542
Yet my client
has been unfairly stripped

11:16.625 --> 11:18.083
of his ability
to trade--

11:18.166 --> 11:20.375
while his firm,
his employees,

11:20.458 --> 11:23.208
and his family
have all been destabilized.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.166
We ask that you bring
this baseless campaign

11:26.250 --> 11:27.500
to its conclusion.

11:27.583 --> 11:28.959
Your Honor, this
entire motion is premature.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.625
The jury gets to decide issues
on material fact.

11:31.709 --> 11:34.250
Whether or not
they believe the evidence.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.125
Mr. Bach is saying
there's no evidence

11:36.208 --> 11:36.959
for them to decide about.

11:37.041 --> 11:40.208
We are pursuing
several threads.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.959
So maybe it's not
this motion that's premature.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.083
Maybe it's
your whole prosecution.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.667
Testimony that
we initially promised to have,

11:45.750 --> 11:48.542
that we meant to have,
should have

11:48.625 --> 11:51.208
is not...available.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.583
We have reason to believe
that several of our witnesses

11:53.667 --> 11:54.792
have been tampered with.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.083
Your Honor--

11:56.166 --> 11:59.208
Mr. Bach, there's no jury to
hear your pained objections.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.709
Mr. Connerty,
do you have any evidence

12:01.792 --> 12:05.417
to back up that claim...for why
you don't have any evidence?

12:06.583 --> 12:08.000
Not at this time.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.208
Then...what do  you have
at this  time?

12:11.291 --> 12:13.291
We are pursuing information
about an operative

12:13.375 --> 12:14.792
we believe
is a direct link

12:14.875 --> 12:17.083
between Mr. Axelrod
and the contaminant

12:17.166 --> 12:19.291
that sabotaged
the juice company.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.250
You have him in custody?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.291
We are pursuing
the thread to him.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.041
So, in other words,
all you have is evidence

12:25.125 --> 12:26.500
against someone
who isn't me.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.333
Mr. Axelrod, do I look
like I need your help?

12:29.417 --> 12:32.667
Mr. Connerty, what do you know
about the operative so far?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.250
Does he
have a name?

12:34.333 --> 12:36.667
That's...part of what
we're trying to ascertain.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.208
We do have witnesses
that can ID him.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.917
If you find him.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.417
Yes.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.041
You a music fan,
Mr. Connerty?

12:49.709 --> 12:51.083
Sure. Much as
the next guy.

12:51.166 --> 12:53.125
Yo-Yo Ma,
Clancy Brothers and such.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.750
I'm thinking of
the great George Clinton.

12:54.834 --> 12:55.875
Who most famously said,

12:55.959 --> 12:57.750
"Free your mind
and your ass will follow."

12:57.834 --> 12:59.041
But only slightly
less known and far more apt

12:59.125 --> 13:02.709
in the case at bar is,
"You can't fake the funk."

13:02.792 --> 13:04.709
As much as I want
to dance to your tune,

13:04.792 --> 13:06.709
if the groove isn't fat enough,
I'm just gonna stand in place.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.166
And right now,
my feet aren't tapping.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.875
That said,
I don't think you're lying.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.834
I'm splitting the baby.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.166
I'm granting Mr. Connerty
one more week.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.792
At that time,
the prosecution will produce

13:17.875 --> 13:19.000
evidence compelling enough
to sustain the case.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.375
Or I will grant Mr. Axelrod
his dismissal.

You're wondering
if Axe Capital can survive

14:40.709 --> 14:42.458
Axe himself
going to jail.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.208
Yes.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.500
Not as we know it.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.000
It'll be about mutation.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.208
The capital will still
need to be managed.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.250
The people here are capable
and the right ones to do it.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.917
But can it thrive, grow,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.625
and continue to really live
if Axe goes to jail?

15:00.709 --> 15:02.458
That'll come down
to one thing.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.667
You know what that is.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.291
You.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.875
But that's
not news to you.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.667
Because part of you
wants that challenge,

15:13.750 --> 15:14.959
part of you is
terrified of it,

15:15.041 --> 15:17.291
and part of you
hates yourself

15:17.375 --> 15:20.834
for hoping he does go away,
so you get a chance to see.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.709
Yes.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.208
Even now I measure myself
against him,

15:24.291 --> 15:25.458
as though he were gone.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.000
And the thought
of coming up short--

15:27.083 --> 15:29.166
Measurable successes
are seductive.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.166
Especially when
we're young.

15:32.625 --> 15:36.834
But when it comes to dealing
with other human beings,

15:36.917 --> 15:38.709
we have to steer
from instinct.

15:38.792 --> 15:39.959
I don't trust instinct.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.417
That's because
you're defining it

15:41.500 --> 15:43.375
in some woo woo
spiritual way.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.041
Don't.

15:45.125 --> 15:48.959
Instead, think of your gut
as the deepest part of you,

15:49.041 --> 15:51.125
the part that can do
internal calculations

15:51.208 --> 15:52.333
on the highest plane.

15:52.417 --> 15:54.834
Axe, at his best,
does this.

15:54.917 --> 15:58.834
You want to be on his level,
in the purest way,

15:58.917 --> 16:02.875
the most profound,
then you must, too.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.291
Identify it.

16:04.375 --> 16:07.250
Separate it
from your fears, your hopes,

16:07.333 --> 16:08.792

in your head.

Because if you don't cultivate
instinct, and listen to it--

-I heard what you said.

21:13.834 --> 21:17.083
But you hear me: Men like
Axelrod do what they need to do.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.458
You counter not in here,
in the courtroom. With evidence.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.000
-In a week.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.709
Goodbye, Mr. Connerty.

21:28.959 --> 21:32.083
No!

21:32.166 --> 21:34.875
Why the hell would you risk
coming to my chambers

21:34.959 --> 21:36.041
just to turn heel
and walk out?

21:36.125 --> 21:38.875
What weak cheese is that?

21:38.959 --> 21:40.333
You said "goodbye."

21:40.417 --> 21:43.041
I'm a judge.
I give orders all day.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.291
You're a litigator.

21:44.375 --> 21:47.583
You find a way to disobey them
without getting nailed for it.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.834
Then I'm not leaving
until you give me an answer.

21:54.291 --> 21:57.667
That sensation you're feeling,
it's known as the Dip.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.834
Seth Godin coined it.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.959
Feels like the moment
before defeat.

22:01.041 --> 22:03.917
It's actually the moment
before success.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.083
Feels more
like Death Valley.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.208
You care so fucking much.
I love that.

22:08.291 --> 22:09.709
I love that.
You're meant for this shit.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.750
Dig in, man.

22:11.834 --> 22:13.250
The world has lost
countless artists and artisans

22:13.333 --> 22:16.333
and engineers
and even politicians who quit

22:16.417 --> 22:18.583
because they cared too much
to come up short

22:18.667 --> 22:21.417
and yet also too much
to keep going.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.333
You push through that Dip
right now,

22:23.417 --> 22:25.625
maybe you put Axelrod
where he needs to be.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.917
Why are you
out of breath?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.583
Bike ride.
I have a recumbent.

22:35.667 --> 22:36.333
Great for the hills
out here.

22:36.417 --> 22:39.417
Of course.
More aerodynamic.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.583
Where are you?

22:40.667 --> 22:42.250
Meditation room.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.750
Oh. I'll go
to mine, too!

22:46.792 --> 22:48.250
Why you hiding out
in there?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.709
I'm not hiding.
My office has been commandeered.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.542
I'm working through issues
with my algorithm

22:52.625 --> 22:54.500

that's quiet.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.917
You ran
another back

22:56.000 --> 22:58.125
My programmers didn't
correct for slippage.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.208
They're software,
not finance.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.625
I have a vision for it
that I haven't yet been able

23:01.709 --> 23:03.083

by the architect

23:04.834 --> 23:06.625

23:06.709 --> 23:08.667
I can keep tweaking it
and improve it incrementally,

23:08.750 --> 23:09.667
or--

23:09.750 --> 23:11.959
Or start over.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.792
Crap. Yes.

23:14.875 --> 23:16.083
I'd have to gut it.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.583

kicked over your Lego city.

23:19.542 --> 23:22.458

Just frustrating.

24:21.834 --> 24:23.041
Yes.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.250
Which in this case
is not an actual baton,

24:24.333 --> 24:28.542
but is Dr. Wendy Rhoades.

24:29.917 --> 24:32.417
I've been doing a little
sleuthing about the IPO;

24:32.500 --> 24:33.417
you know,
winners and losers.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.583
And I discover
that one particular fund

24:36.667 --> 24:38.417
made a killing that day
shorting the stock.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.500
So I look to see
whose account it is,

24:40.583 --> 24:43.458
and I notice
there's an irregularity.

24:43.542 --> 24:45.792
So I keep digging,

24:45.875 --> 24:48.792
and lo and behold--
it's Wendy's.

24:48.875 --> 24:52.500
The name on the account had been
flipped with someone else's.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.458
Now this is the first time
she has ever even made a trade,

24:54.542 --> 24:57.875
herself, in her whole history
at Axe Cap.

24:57.959 --> 25:00.333
So I get a buddy of mine who
works for the NSA to find out

25:00.417 --> 25:02.083
where she was
when she called in

25:02.166 --> 25:03.583

-Wait.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.125

look into Wendy?

25:05.208 --> 25:06.917
Completely off-book.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.333

25:08.417 --> 25:11.917
Southern District
of New York.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.542
Chuck's office.

25:13.625 --> 25:18.000
We got some real
Whitewater shit here.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.542
Needless to say: with this
in Bryan Connerty's hands,

25:20.625 --> 25:23.375
the spotlight
moves off of you

25:23.458 --> 25:26.959

Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades.

25:27.041 --> 25:28.583
Chaos grenade.

25:32.041 --> 25:34.542
If this were
the four by 100 meter relay,

25:34.625 --> 25:37.500
you would be disqualified for
sniffing glue on the team bus.
