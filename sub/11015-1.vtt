<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how nature gets its glow?</i>

00:58.698 --> 01:03.067
<i>Who gives it light and color</i>
<i>as the seasons come and go?</i>

01:06.039 --> 01:09.475
<i>Who helps all creatures,</i>
<i>great and small,</i>

01:09.576 --> 01:12.170
<i>to walk, to swim, to fly?</i>

01:14.714 --> 01:17.046
<i>Who crafts such tiny details?</i>

01:20.420 --> 01:22.650
<i>You might see them if you try.</i>

01:25.158 --> 01:29.959
<i>For it's all the work of fairies,</i>
<i>but they stay well out of sight.</i>

01:37.303 --> 01:42.138
<i>And the first time that a baby laughs,</i>
<i>a fairy's life takes flight.</i>

01:43.443 --> 01:44.933
<i>When the moon comes out</i>

01:45.044 --> 01:47.171
<i>To shine her face</i>

01:47.280 --> 01:50.044
<i>The birds are fast asleep</i>

01:50.150 --> 01:56.521
<i>And the lanterns hang from every post</i>
<i>The fairies leave their keep</i>

01:56.623 --> 02:00.320
<i>They join their hands</i>
<i>and sing their songs</i>

02:00.427 --> 02:03.328
<i>That nary a soul can hear</i>

02:03.430 --> 02:06.331
<i>In the springtime</i>
<i>when the earth is new</i>

02:07.500 --> 02:11.095
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

02:11.204 --> 02:18.167
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

03:45.064 --> 03:46.622
Hello.
- Hello.

03:46.733 --> 03:48.223
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:48.334 --> 03:49.961
- Hello.
- Hello.

03:50.670 --> 03:51.830
Hello?

03:53.006 --> 03:54.496
Queen Clarion.

04:05.818 --> 04:08.912
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,

04:09.522 --> 04:11.820
happiness has brought you here.

04:12.358 --> 04:16.795
Welcome to Pixie Hollow.
I trust you found your way all right.

04:17.262 --> 04:18.958
I think so.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.232
Now, let's see about those wings.

05:06.879 --> 05:08.608
What are these things?

05:08.715 --> 05:11.479
They will help you
find your talent, little one.

05:11.584 --> 05:14.075
But how will I know which one is...

05:15.655 --> 05:17.054
You'll know.

06:10.243 --> 06:11.267
Hmm.

06:54.721 --> 06:55.710
Whoa!

06:55.822 --> 07:00.020
Never seen one glow that much before,
even for Vidia.

07:00.293 --> 07:01.920
You know,
I do believe you're right.

07:02.028 --> 07:05.862
Little daisy top
might be a very rare talent indeed.

07:14.373 --> 07:16.807
Come forward, tinker fairies,

07:16.909 --> 07:21.903
and welcome the newest member
of your talent guild, Tinker Bell.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.778
Glad we had a bath today, eh, Clank?

07:25.885 --> 07:27.284
Excuse us!
- Coming through!

07:27.386 --> 07:29.854
Sorry! Make way for tinkers!

07:31.057 --> 07:34.823
Hady-hi, hady-ho, Miss Bell. I'm Clank.

07:35.461 --> 07:38.225
Splinters, Clank. Say it, don't spray it.

07:38.331 --> 07:41.823
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire,
at your service.

07:41.934 --> 07:43.094
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

07:43.202 --> 07:46.365
Oh, foo! He's Bobble, I'm Clank.

07:47.573 --> 07:49.040
Clank, Bobble.

07:49.709 --> 07:53.406
We're pleased as a pile of
perfectly polished pots you're here.

07:53.513 --> 07:54.571
Uh...

07:54.814 --> 07:55.781
Me, too.

07:56.949 --> 08:00.043
Come on, Miss Bell.
There's so much to show you.

08:02.555 --> 08:07.322
You've arrived
at a most wondrous and glorious time.

08:07.426 --> 08:08.688
Really? Why?

08:08.795 --> 08:12.094
Why, it's almost time
for the changing of the seasons.

08:12.198 --> 08:16.498
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year.

08:16.602 --> 08:17.660
Well, there's one up ahead.

08:22.742 --> 08:25.973
Winter Woods. It's always cold here.

08:26.078 --> 08:29.673
Look there! Snowflake and frost fairies
returning home for...

08:29.782 --> 08:32.443
For some well-deserved rest.

08:32.552 --> 08:36.078
Aye. They've just finished
bringing winter to the world.

08:37.490 --> 08:40.152
It's the off-season
for the autumn fairies, too.

08:40.259 --> 08:43.558
Always practicing
that perfect shade of amber, eh?

08:43.663 --> 08:45.460
And the fairies of Summer Glade

08:45.565 --> 08:47.556
still have plenty of time to get ready.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.862
But not as much
as the autumn fairies,

08:49.969 --> 08:51.402
of course, because, well...

08:51.504 --> 08:54.996
Yes, Clanky. Because
right now, fairies of every talent

08:55.107 --> 08:58.406
are preparing for my favorite season,
springtime!

08:59.946 --> 09:00.935
Oh!

09:03.516 --> 09:07.008
Get along.
Get along, little sproutlings, and dig.

09:12.024 --> 09:13.423
Hello, there!

09:14.827 --> 09:18.126
Come on, Miss Bell.
You've got to see where we live.

09:24.503 --> 09:26.664
Welcome to Tinker's Nook.

09:26.772 --> 09:28.899
Oh, wow!

09:38.451 --> 09:39.418
Oh.

09:40.953 --> 09:43.615
Come on.
There's so much to show you.

10:06.712 --> 10:07.838
Cute.

10:09.815 --> 10:11.180
Just taking some supplies down...

10:11.284 --> 10:14.014
They're taking supplies
down to the workshop.

10:16.822 --> 10:18.187
Let her go.

10:18.824 --> 10:19.813
Watch out for falling...

10:19.926 --> 10:22.360
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

10:25.831 --> 10:26.889
Wow!

10:37.643 --> 10:40.771
And over here is where most of us live.
There's your house...

10:40.880 --> 10:43.178
There's your house, Tinker Bell.

10:48.587 --> 10:50.350
- It's mine?
- Sure is.

10:51.057 --> 10:53.184
We were hoping the new arrival
would be one of us,

10:53.292 --> 10:55.692
so we got the place all ready.

10:55.795 --> 10:57.194
We rounded up some work clothes...

10:57.296 --> 10:59.696
- We didn't know your size.
- Yes, our apologies, but...

10:59.799 --> 11:02.427
- But they might be too big.
- Yeah, well, that's only...

11:02.535 --> 11:04.696
'Cause you're so tiny.

11:04.804 --> 11:06.271
That'll do, Clank.

11:06.372 --> 11:08.738
Please come on down to the workshop
when you're ready.

11:08.841 --> 11:10.604
Fairy Mary will want to meet you.

11:10.710 --> 11:11.938
Goodbye.

11:19.952 --> 11:20.919
Oh.

12:05.998 --> 12:07.659
Stop! What?

12:08.267 --> 12:12.135
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.

12:12.238 --> 12:13.432
Oh, you said five.

12:13.539 --> 12:17.669
I said seven! Oh, Clank, I tell you,
sometimes you can be pretty,

12:17.777 --> 12:19.039
pretty...

12:22.148 --> 12:24.343
So pretty.

12:26.218 --> 12:29.619
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain.

12:32.892 --> 12:35.122
Wow, everyone seems so busy.

12:35.227 --> 12:37.718
Well, spring won't spring itself.

12:37.830 --> 12:42.267
Indeed, my bellowing buddy.
And we tinkers are a big part of it.

12:42.368 --> 12:44.768
Allow us to elucidate, Miss Bell.

12:45.604 --> 12:48.573
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

12:48.674 --> 12:51.643
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

12:51.744 --> 12:54.542
- Weave saddles and satchels.
- For birdies, you see.

12:54.647 --> 12:57.639
- Make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds!

12:57.750 --> 13:00.446
- When preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more!

13:00.553 --> 13:04.717
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

13:06.258 --> 13:07.384
That was great.

13:07.493 --> 13:12.294
So you see, Miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

13:12.398 --> 13:16.129
Unfortunately, all those fairies
are out of luck this year.

13:16.235 --> 13:18.863
Unless we can actually
deliver these things to them.

13:18.971 --> 13:21.405
The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?

13:25.010 --> 13:26.637
Yes, Fairy Mary.

13:26.912 --> 13:29.881
- Tip-top shape.
- No wheels missing whatsoever!

13:31.317 --> 13:32.784
Then let's see it.

13:32.885 --> 13:35.319
- Ah, you see... Well...
- See,

13:35.421 --> 13:38.652
- with your eyes?
- Define "see," actually...

13:38.858 --> 13:41.622
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What? Who?

13:41.861 --> 13:44.625
- She's new, Fairy Mary.
- Nice to meet you.

13:44.730 --> 13:47.597
Rapture! A new charge on whom
we can lavish

13:47.700 --> 13:50.430
all our tinkering wisdom and expertise!

13:52.571 --> 13:54.471
Let me see those hands.

13:55.341 --> 13:58.276
Teetering teapots, so dainty.

13:58.611 --> 14:02.672
Don't worry, dear. We'll build up those
tinker muscles in no time.

14:02.848 --> 14:03.906
Okay.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.644
- Now, boys, the deliveries?
- Aye, we're on it.

14:07.753 --> 14:10.620
As a matter of fact,
we're heading out right this second.

14:10.723 --> 14:14.591
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

14:15.227 --> 14:19.061
Nothing really,
Clank was just asking...

14:19.165 --> 14:21.531
If I can go as well!

14:22.001 --> 14:24.629
- Yeah! Good one. Very nice.
- Yes! I wondered that,

14:24.737 --> 14:29.197
- if you could go with us. Yes.
- That's exactly what he was saying.

14:29.775 --> 14:31.572
Very well. Get on with it, then.

14:33.679 --> 14:36.409
Slow down, Cheese, I can't keep up!

14:37.616 --> 14:39.607
The mouse's name is Cheese?

14:39.718 --> 14:42.551
Must be.
He always comes when we yell it.

15:10.883 --> 15:13.875
Sprinting thistles!
Bobble! Bobble!

15:49.922 --> 15:55.121
Easy. Easy, boy. It's all right.
Fawn's got you.

15:56.428 --> 16:00.831
Easy. Easy, girl. It's all right.
Silvermist's got you.

16:02.034 --> 16:03.467
Oh, you all right, sugar cane?

16:03.569 --> 16:04.862
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

16:06.071 --> 16:08.869
Elevate her legs. No, wait.
I mean her head.

16:08.974 --> 16:10.805
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
If she's red, raise the head.

16:10.909 --> 16:13.070
If she's pale, raise the tail.

16:13.345 --> 16:15.245
Does she look pale or red?

16:15.381 --> 16:17.144
She looks squished.

16:17.883 --> 16:19.043
Sorry.

16:19.285 --> 16:22.413
Here, let me, raindrop.
So, what happened to you, anyway?

16:22.521 --> 16:24.853
- Well, I...
- It was sprinting thistles!

16:26.058 --> 16:28.219
Those weeds are an absolute menace.

16:28.327 --> 16:31.763
Always trampling things,
poking people in the petunia.

16:33.232 --> 16:34.756
Gather round, ladies.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.266
We've brought some selections

16:36.368 --> 16:39.531
from the new spring line
of tinker specialties!

16:39.638 --> 16:41.230
- All right!
- Show us, show us!

16:41.340 --> 16:44.366
- What'd you bring?
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa.

16:44.476 --> 16:47.138
Finally! Silvermist,
could you help me?

16:57.723 --> 16:58.747
Oh.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.425
What're you gonna do with that?

17:09.535 --> 17:11.469
I'm gonna take it to the mainland.

17:11.569 --> 17:12.763
What's the mainland?

17:12.871 --> 17:14.896
It's where we're gonna go
change winter to spring.

17:15.007 --> 17:17.635
The seasons change all the time there.

17:17.810 --> 17:20.335
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

17:20.445 --> 17:23.506
Yeah. And I'll have breakfast ready
for all the wittle fuzzies

17:23.615 --> 17:25.606
coming out of hibernation.

17:27.653 --> 17:29.518
We just follow the second star...

17:29.621 --> 17:32.181
Ride the breeze, follow the waves...

17:32.291 --> 17:34.259
All the way across the sea...

17:34.360 --> 17:36.225
And then, there it is.

17:36.929 --> 17:41.093
Wow! The mainland sounds flitterific!

17:44.303 --> 17:48.103
Yes. The glamorous lives
of the nature-talent fairies, eh?

17:48.207 --> 17:49.674
We'd love to stay and chat, but...

17:49.775 --> 17:53.438
But we tinkers
have real work to do. Right?

17:53.545 --> 17:56.776
Don't get your wings in a bunch.
- Don't be like that.

17:56.882 --> 17:58.315
Nice to meet you all!

17:58.417 --> 18:01.648
You, too! Fly with you later!
- Fly with you later!

18:03.956 --> 18:05.355
Right! Here we are.

18:05.457 --> 18:07.618
A pretty large order of pollen pots
for the...

18:21.840 --> 18:24.468
Last thing is berry bushels
to deliver to the glen...

18:24.576 --> 18:26.806
Is it okay
if I just catch up with you later?

18:26.912 --> 18:28.402
Oh, I suppose.

18:29.181 --> 18:31.240
Can you find your way back?

18:31.583 --> 18:34.484
- Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.
- Well, I...

18:34.686 --> 18:37.246
- All right, then.
- Just be careful!

18:40.726 --> 18:41.715
Hi, there!

18:44.563 --> 18:45.757
Sorry.

18:46.165 --> 18:47.632
Vidia, right?

18:54.573 --> 18:57.406
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Tinker Bell.

18:58.210 --> 18:59.472
Oh, yes.

19:00.846 --> 19:02.040
The new girl.

19:02.147 --> 19:05.776
That's right! So, what's your talent?

19:07.719 --> 19:09.653
What do you think it is?

19:10.255 --> 19:15.750
You're a pollen-izer? Pollen-ator?
Pollen-picker? Pollen-plucker?

19:15.861 --> 19:19.490
I am a fast-flying fairy,
a true rare talent.

19:19.965 --> 19:22.433
And this is but a small part of what I do.

19:22.534 --> 19:26.197
I make breezes in the summer,
blow down leaves in the fall.

19:26.305 --> 19:29.103
My winds even brought you here, dear.

19:29.208 --> 19:32.075
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

19:33.011 --> 19:35.377
Hey, that's just like what I do.

19:36.782 --> 19:37.771
Excuse me?

19:37.916 --> 19:40.214
I mean, tinkers help fairies
of every talent, too.

19:40.319 --> 19:42.844
So we're kind of the same, you know?

19:45.224 --> 19:48.853
Sweetie, I make forces of nature.

19:49.361 --> 19:51.056
You make pots and kettles.

19:51.163 --> 19:55.429
I work up in the sky,
and you work down in a ditch.

19:56.101 --> 19:57.159
Hey!

19:57.269 --> 20:00.397
Don't get me wrong, sunshine.
Being a tinker is really swell and all,

20:00.506 --> 20:03.669
but I wouldn't go around
bragging about your talent.

20:03.775 --> 20:06.073
It's not like spring depends on you.

20:06.178 --> 20:07.702
Of course it does!

20:07.813 --> 20:11.408
And when I go to the mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are.

20:11.517 --> 20:13.485
When who goes to the mainland?

20:13.585 --> 20:16.418
Me, of course! For spring!

20:18.824 --> 20:21.486
Oh, of course. You'll prove it, huh?

20:21.793 --> 20:22.851
Yes, I will.

20:22.961 --> 20:27.660
Well, I, for one,
am looking forward to that. Excuse me.

20:29.201 --> 20:30.964
No. Excuse me.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.533
"Mine is a rare talent."

20:38.777 --> 20:39.801
Ugh.

20:41.547 --> 20:43.845
Try and tell me tinkers don't matter.

20:43.949 --> 20:46.440
I'll show her what a rare talent really is,
when I...

21:57.356 --> 21:58.380
Oh.

22:20.912 --> 22:23.437
- Hey, Tink, what you got there?
- Oh, hi.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.513
I don't know. I just found them.

22:27.919 --> 22:29.386
Lost things.

22:30.389 --> 22:32.050
- Lost things.
- Aye.

22:32.157 --> 22:36.116
Stuff gets lost and washes up
on Neverland from time to time.

22:36.228 --> 22:37.957
You know, from the mainland.

22:38.063 --> 22:40.190
These come from the mainland?

22:40.298 --> 22:42.960
That place sounds
more fascinating all the time.

22:43.068 --> 22:47.596
Berry bushels, check.
Pollen pots, check. Lost things, check.

22:48.340 --> 22:49.307
Huh?

22:50.008 --> 22:53.273
Lost things?
Why are you fiddling with that junk?

22:53.378 --> 22:54.709
Oh, um...

22:55.113 --> 22:57.741
Well, they were just so unusual.

22:57.849 --> 23:00.317
You mustn't be wasting your time
with that rubbish.

23:00.419 --> 23:02.979
And I won't have it
cluttering up my workshop.

23:03.088 --> 23:04.919
And as for you two,

23:05.724 --> 23:08.090
no more dilly-dallying around.

23:08.193 --> 23:10.593
And don't forget about
the Queen's review tonight.

23:10.696 --> 23:13.563
Goodness, there's still
so much to be done!

23:17.235 --> 23:18.634
Thank you.

23:19.304 --> 23:21.397
Sorry about your trinkets, Miss Bell.

23:21.506 --> 23:24.498
Well, we'd best be getting ready
for the review, anyway.

23:24.609 --> 23:26.770
What is the Queen's review?

23:26.878 --> 23:30.814
You see, the Queen is going to
review all the preparations for spring!

23:30.916 --> 23:34.909
Yeah, it's a good time for us tinkers
to show what we can do, eh?

23:35.020 --> 23:36.783
- Oh, indeed.
- Really?

23:37.422 --> 23:39.413
Like me. I can be a wheel.

23:40.158 --> 23:41.216
Hmm.

23:42.294 --> 23:45.024
Perfect. That's my chance.

24:42.154 --> 24:46.648
Okay, everybody, turn!
Ready for the base coat over here!

24:57.302 --> 25:02.205
Splendid, splendid. Stack those neatly,
plenty of time before the Queen arrives.

25:02.307 --> 25:03.501
It's the Queen!

25:03.608 --> 25:06.702
What? She's here? Now?
Play, music fairies.

25:07.779 --> 25:09.076
Yes, play!

25:24.563 --> 25:26.326
Queen Clarion, Your Illustriousness!

25:26.431 --> 25:30.663
As Minister of Spring,
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

25:30.869 --> 25:33.269
What? No fireworks, Minister?

25:33.371 --> 25:36.397
Oh, well, yeah, that could be arranged.
Light fairies! Light fairies!

25:36.508 --> 25:39.705
I'm teasing.
You always make such a fuss,

25:39.811 --> 25:42.678
and everything always
turns out wonderfully.

25:45.684 --> 25:48.380
Well, I think you'll find
that we have things well in hand.

25:48.486 --> 25:50.044
When the Everblossom blooms,

25:50.155 --> 25:52.680
we'll be ready to bring
spring to the mainland!

25:52.791 --> 25:55.021
Music to my ears.

25:55.126 --> 25:58.357
I know you've all put in months
of practice and preparation,

25:58.897 --> 26:01.661
but keep up the good work
these last few days,

26:01.766 --> 26:03.791
- because just as fairies...
- Queen Clarion!

26:05.670 --> 26:06.637
Huh?

26:07.038 --> 26:08.505
Queen Clarion!

26:09.941 --> 26:12.239
- Did I miss anything?
- No, no, no.

26:12.410 --> 26:13.900
Phew! Good.

26:14.479 --> 26:15.468
It's all right.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.377
I came up with some fantastic things

26:17.482 --> 26:20.042
for tinkers to use
when we go to the mainland.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.787
What's she talking about?

26:23.889 --> 26:25.481
Let me show you!

26:27.192 --> 26:30.423
First, baby chipmunks
can't eat the whole nut, right?

26:30.528 --> 26:32.860
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

26:32.964 --> 26:36.422
So you just crank back this lever,
and it's...

26:46.011 --> 26:47.171
Whoops.

26:47.479 --> 26:51.210
- It's kind of a work in progress.
- Yes, yes, yes. Very clever.

26:53.485 --> 26:54.474
Oh!

26:54.586 --> 26:57.180
And I made this, too.
It's a flower-sprayer.

26:57.289 --> 27:00.486
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Here, allow me to demonstrate.

27:10.302 --> 27:11.462
Sorry.

27:11.970 --> 27:15.838
- But wait till you see this last one.
- Tinker Bell, sweetheart,

27:16.341 --> 27:18.104
has no one explained?

27:19.844 --> 27:21.368
Explained what?

27:21.813 --> 27:24.680
Tinker fairies
don't go to the mainland, dear.

27:24.950 --> 27:25.917
What?

27:26.017 --> 27:29.612
All of those things
are done by the nature-talent fairies.

27:29.721 --> 27:32.315
Your work is here in Pixie Hollow.

27:32.857 --> 27:36.054
- But I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell.

27:38.463 --> 27:42.263
Oh, okay. No. No, that's good.

27:42.367 --> 27:45.063
I mean,
I really couldn't make it anyway.

27:45.170 --> 27:50.039
So, good. Yeah.
This actually works out good.

27:50.542 --> 27:55.275
I mean, well...
So, I'm just gonna... Yeah.

28:12.731 --> 28:14.164
Back so soon?

28:14.866 --> 28:16.060
You didn't go?

28:16.167 --> 28:19.762
Goodness, no.
Far too much work to do down here.

28:29.748 --> 28:32.979
Vidia was right. Being a tinker stinks.

28:33.852 --> 28:35.649
Excuse me?

28:36.421 --> 28:39.618
It's just, why don't we get to go
to the mainland?

28:40.725 --> 28:45.059
The mainland? Who gives
a pile of pebbles about the mainland?

28:45.764 --> 28:48.289
But, Fairy Mary,
the other fairies get to go.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.597
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you a garden fairy?

28:52.504 --> 28:53.698
Well, no.

28:53.805 --> 28:56.239
- Are you a light fairy?
- No.

28:56.341 --> 28:59.105
Animal fairy? Water fairy, perhaps?

28:59.210 --> 29:00.677
No and no.

29:00.779 --> 29:04.977
No. You're not. You are a tinker.
It's who you are.

29:05.417 --> 29:06.907
Be proud of it.

29:08.286 --> 29:11.255
The day you can
magically make the flowers grow,

29:11.356 --> 29:15.156
or capture the rays of the sun
and whatnot, then you can go.

29:15.527 --> 29:17.757
Until then, your work is here.

29:42.654 --> 29:44.815
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

29:56.134 --> 29:57.101
Get your pixie dust yet?

29:57.202 --> 29:58.169
Just did.

29:58.269 --> 30:00.134
- Nice day for flying.
- Sure is.

30:00.238 --> 30:01.227
Here you go, Silvermist.

30:01.339 --> 30:03.068
Thank you, Terence.

30:04.742 --> 30:06.676
I hope Tinker Bell is okay.

30:06.778 --> 30:09.144
I know. That poor little sapling.

30:09.981 --> 30:12.040
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

30:12.150 --> 30:14.516
Well, I wouldn't blame her
if she stayed in bed all day.

30:14.619 --> 30:16.143
Morning, girls!

30:16.254 --> 30:17.221
Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell?

30:17.322 --> 30:21.224
Guess what? I've decided I'm not
gonna be a tinker fairy anymore.

30:21.326 --> 30:22.315
- What?
- What?

30:22.427 --> 30:25.590
Well, I was thinking.
Why do I have to be a tinker?

30:25.697 --> 30:28.257
Just 'cause
some silly hammer glowed?

30:28.366 --> 30:31.028
I mean, who's to say
it wasn't some big mistake?

30:31.136 --> 30:33.434
Maybe I can just switch my talent.

30:33.538 --> 30:36.939
Switch your talent?
I don't know, Tinker Bell...

30:37.041 --> 30:39.703
If you could teach me your talents,
any of them,

30:39.811 --> 30:42.678
maybe I could show the Queen
I can work with nature, too.

30:44.249 --> 30:46.683
And then she'd let me go
to the mainland for spring.

30:46.784 --> 30:49.981
Oh, Tinker Bell.
That's just not how it works.

30:50.088 --> 30:52.886
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right. She could.

30:52.991 --> 30:55.721
Well, I've never heard of someone
switching talents before.

30:55.827 --> 30:57.761
She's right. Me, neither.

30:57.929 --> 31:04.425
Look. You all do things that are
beautiful and magical and important.

31:04.736 --> 31:08.172
But me, well,

31:08.273 --> 31:12.004
there's gotta be more to my life
than just pots and kettles.

31:12.877 --> 31:15.744
All I'm asking
is that you give me a chance.

31:17.549 --> 31:18.982
I'll help you, Tinker Bell.

31:19.083 --> 31:20.744
Thank you, Sil.

31:20.852 --> 31:22.717
Me, too. Could be fun.

31:22.954 --> 31:26.890
Well, first time for everything, I guess.
What harm can come from trying?

31:26.991 --> 31:29.653
Well, I still think this is a bad idea.

31:32.297 --> 31:34.857
So, for your first day
of water fairy training,

31:34.966 --> 31:37.161
I could show you
how to make ripples in the pond.

31:37.268 --> 31:38.326
Okay!

31:38.436 --> 31:41.234
Or teach you how to talk
to the babbling brook.

31:41.339 --> 31:43.068
Oh, that sounds fun, too.

31:43.174 --> 31:46.405
Or wait, wait, wait.
I got it, I got it, I got it!

31:47.011 --> 31:49.707
Dewdrops on spider webs!

31:50.748 --> 31:52.545
Come on. I'll show you how to do it.

31:52.650 --> 31:55.016
- Good luck, Tink!
- You can do it!

31:56.621 --> 31:57.679
Oh, um...

31:57.789 --> 31:59.279
Go get 'em.

32:01.759 --> 32:07.629
Just cup your hands like this,
reach into the water, and...

32:08.333 --> 32:10.528
Okay, you've heard of a dewdrop?

32:10.635 --> 32:14.571
This is a don't drop.
That's water fairy humor.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.005
It's good.

32:17.609 --> 32:18.576
Come on.

32:18.676 --> 32:21.509
Okay, Tink, now,
this next part can be a little tricky.

32:21.613 --> 32:24.377
It takes a very steady,
delicate hand to...

32:27.285 --> 32:29.116
Where's your dewdrop?

32:29.387 --> 32:30.354
Oh.

32:31.856 --> 32:33.585
Forgot my dewdrop.

32:37.528 --> 32:38.825
Hey! I did

32:39.764 --> 32:40.753
it.

32:40.865 --> 32:44.266
Shake that one off. Shake it off.
You can do this!

32:47.472 --> 32:50.805
That's it. That's it, Tink.
You're doing it! You're...

32:52.443 --> 32:54.206
Now, Tink, try to...

32:54.512 --> 32:57.743
No, no, sweetie, you need to...
Well, maybe if you...

32:58.950 --> 33:01.680
Well, you have to admire
her persistence.

33:01.953 --> 33:02.977
Tinker Bell!

33:03.087 --> 33:05.385
Although, sometimes hammers glow

33:06.057 --> 33:07.490
for a reason.

33:13.298 --> 33:14.390
Whoa.

33:26.978 --> 33:31.415
You know, you always struck me
as a light fairy kind of gal.

33:43.394 --> 33:45.988
<i>Here we go in the treasure...</i>

33:49.967 --> 33:50.968
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you. Not thirsty!

33:54.238 --> 33:56.206
No, no. Not "drink," Tink!

33:56.541 --> 33:59.203
Pink? I like purple meself!

33:59.310 --> 34:02.040
Tink! Have you seen Tink?

34:02.146 --> 34:03.272
What?

34:03.848 --> 34:06.908
I do not stink! Maybe it's you, eh?

34:09.020 --> 34:10.987
Hey, have you seen Tink?

34:13.324 --> 34:16.815
- Fairy Mary's gonna be cross.
- Aye, Clank.

34:16.928 --> 34:19.158
We'd better take some of this
off Miss Bell's plate, so...

34:19.263 --> 34:21.722
- All right, then.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, Clank!

34:27.472 --> 34:30.498
What are...
Will you two stop mucking about?

34:30.608 --> 34:33.873
- What Clank did was, he took it off...
- Bobble told me that I should...

34:33.978 --> 34:37.937
I see Tinker Bell has
got her work done, mysteriously.

34:38.549 --> 34:39.947
Where is she, anyway?

34:41.152 --> 34:43.712
Well, you see, she's...

34:44.121 --> 34:46.112
She went with Cheese to...

34:47.625 --> 34:50.617
No, no. Clank means
she went to get cheese, you see,

34:50.728 --> 34:53.719
- the food, for Cheese the mouse...
- Yes, the food, for Cheese the mouse.

34:53.831 --> 34:56.458
...because he was whining.

34:56.567 --> 34:57.556
Yeah. Like a baby.

34:57.668 --> 35:00.364
Like a wittle, wee baby, there.

35:12.950 --> 35:17.319
Okay, what can I teach you that's
gonna do the least amount of damage?

35:19.857 --> 35:22.382
Oh, I know. Follow me, Tinker Bell.

35:27.865 --> 35:32.063
The last light of day,
it's the richest kind of all!

35:32.170 --> 35:36.038
Wait for it. Wait for it.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.005
Okay, and now!

35:38.109 --> 35:39.974
Oh, wow.

35:42.346 --> 35:43.438
Huh?

35:45.483 --> 35:46.814
It's incredible.

35:46.918 --> 35:48.749
Now for the fun part.

35:49.654 --> 35:53.420
- Do you think it's heavy?
- No. It's light.

36:05.136 --> 36:06.501
Okay, okay.

36:38.836 --> 36:39.894
Stay.

36:40.004 --> 36:43.030
- Here, Tink. Let me...
- No! I almost got it.

36:43.140 --> 36:44.835
If I just get you started...

36:44.942 --> 36:46.876
This is impossible!

36:50.281 --> 36:51.543
Look out!

36:57.755 --> 36:59.017
Oh, no.

36:59.724 --> 37:01.453
Whoa!

37:04.729 --> 37:06.697
I wonder how it's going.

37:07.565 --> 37:09.430
Fly, Tink, fly!

37:10.101 --> 37:11.261
Uh-oh.

37:12.703 --> 37:13.761
We'll save you, Tink!

37:13.871 --> 37:15.839
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!

37:15.940 --> 37:18.170
Cover your tushy!

37:31.155 --> 37:33.487
- We fiddle and fix.
- Craft and create.

37:33.591 --> 37:35.718
- Carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

37:35.826 --> 37:38.386
- Preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more.

37:38.496 --> 37:42.262
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

37:44.702 --> 37:46.932
Tinker Bell,
I'd like a word with you.

37:47.038 --> 37:48.403
Fairy Mary!

37:49.073 --> 37:53.772
See, I was on my deliveries,
and it's actually kind of...

37:53.878 --> 37:57.143
Save it.
I know what you've been up to, missy.

37:58.950 --> 38:01.851
And I had such high hopes for you.

38:13.197 --> 38:15.188
- You'd do well to listen to her...
- Why?

38:15.299 --> 38:17.233
So I can do this my whole life?

38:17.335 --> 38:20.361
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

38:22.807 --> 38:25.708
No, no, not that you guys are...

38:27.178 --> 38:30.875
I didn't mean that... Guys, I wasn't...

38:33.150 --> 38:34.617
I have to go.

38:49.066 --> 38:53.935
Now, flap them. Flap them.
That's it! Have fun!

38:58.843 --> 39:00.674
Hey, Tink! You ready?

39:01.112 --> 39:02.773
A little nervous, actually.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.542
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on, you'll be fine.

39:05.650 --> 39:08.380
We're teaching baby birds
how to fly.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.748
First, you have to get their attention.

39:11.856 --> 39:14.723
Smile and establish trust.

39:15.860 --> 39:21.162
See? Okay, open your wings, honey,
and flap them up and down.

39:21.465 --> 39:25.526
Up and down. That's the way.
Faster, faster.

39:25.636 --> 39:29.538
That's right. Yes! You're doing it! Okay.
Come out this way a little bit.

39:30.541 --> 39:35.501
You're okay. You're okay. You got it.
Keep flapping, keep flapping!

39:35.680 --> 39:38.581
Hey, why don't you help
that last little guy?

39:43.554 --> 39:48.082
Okay, okay.
Just smile and establish trust.

39:48.526 --> 39:49.857
Hi, there!

39:50.728 --> 39:54.687
Hey, little fella,
you wanna do some flap-flap today?

39:56.233 --> 39:58.258
Oh, sure you do!

39:58.369 --> 40:02.237
All you do is,
you just flap your wings, like this.

40:04.909 --> 40:08.174
No, no, no. None of that.
Come on. All we got to do is...

40:08.279 --> 40:09.268
Ow!

40:11.615 --> 40:13.981
Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?

40:14.085 --> 40:17.714
I kind of bombed out on
the whole water and light fairy things,

40:17.822 --> 40:20.188
and I'm starting to
run out of options here.

40:20.291 --> 40:22.816
If you could see fit
to flap your little wings

40:22.927 --> 40:25.293
and take flight
for a few measly seconds,

40:25.396 --> 40:28.797
I might be able to go to the mainland
and bring happiness to the world!

40:28.899 --> 40:30.833
What do you say?

40:31.702 --> 40:33.169
Wrong answer.

40:34.972 --> 40:37.372
If I end up making acorn kettles
for the rest of my life,

40:37.475 --> 40:39.466
I am holding you
personally responsible.

40:41.212 --> 40:43.112
Hey, hey. Look at this!

40:43.314 --> 40:48.308
Okay, just stop squirming.
Would you just... Hey!

40:49.019 --> 40:52.614
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm letting go. I am letting go.

40:57.394 --> 40:59.157
This is not working.

41:01.866 --> 41:05.324
Hey, maybe that guy can help.
He's a really good flyer.

41:06.837 --> 41:08.304
Hey, up there!

41:11.842 --> 41:12.934
Hawk!

41:23.821 --> 41:25.186
- What's happening?
- Quick, hide!

41:25.289 --> 41:26.551
Look out!

41:32.296 --> 41:34.696
A hawk! Tinker Bell's in trouble!

41:48.913 --> 41:50.175
- Hey!
- Vidia?

41:50.281 --> 41:52.181
This is my hiding spot!

41:54.285 --> 41:56.185
But it's all yours, now.

41:58.923 --> 41:59.947
No!

42:10.868 --> 42:14.031
- Get him!
- Get him!

42:19.476 --> 42:22.036
What?
- You all right?

42:23.681 --> 42:24.841
So scary.

42:32.423 --> 42:34.186
Are you okay, Vidia?

42:37.595 --> 42:39.722
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me! I'm fine!

42:39.830 --> 42:43.095
- But I was only trying to help.
- Well, stop trying.

42:47.938 --> 42:49.428
Tinker Bell...

42:50.941 --> 42:53.535
I can't hold water. I can't hold light.

42:53.644 --> 42:57.375
Birds hate me. I'm just so useless!

42:57.481 --> 42:58.675
Tink.

43:11.629 --> 43:14.530
Great.
I failed for the third time in a row.

43:15.532 --> 43:20.299
At this rate, I should get to
the mainland right about... Oh... Never!

43:22.506 --> 43:23.473
Huh?

44:17.261 --> 44:18.319
Yes!

44:27.371 --> 44:28.429
Sil!

45:13.584 --> 45:14.881
Beautiful.

45:43.614 --> 45:45.081
You fixed it!
- Wow!

45:45.249 --> 45:47.080
Beautiful!
- Amazing!

45:47.184 --> 45:48.173
What are you guys doing here?

45:48.285 --> 45:51.152
It might be
the sparkliest thing I've ever seen,

45:51.255 --> 45:52.779
and I've seen a lot of sparkly things!

45:52.890 --> 45:57.224
It's a really pretty thingy. What is it?

45:57.561 --> 45:59.256
I don't know. I just found it.

45:59.363 --> 46:03.766
Tinker Bell, don't you even realize
what you're doing? You're tinkering!

46:04.068 --> 46:07.504
What? No, no, this isn't... I was just...

46:07.805 --> 46:11.969
Creating those gadgets,
figuring things out, fixing stuff like this,

46:12.276 --> 46:14.039
that's what tinkering is, sweetie!

46:14.144 --> 46:17.602
Don't you like doing this?
Isn't it what you really love?

46:17.714 --> 46:20.239
Yeah! Who cares about
going to the mainland, anyway?

46:20.350 --> 46:22.682
Well, I do, remember?

46:23.353 --> 46:25.583
I want to see
where these things come from.

46:25.689 --> 46:28.021
Why are you saying this?
Are you just giving up on me?

46:28.125 --> 46:31.617
I mean, aren't you going to teach me
to be a garden fairy anymore?

46:31.728 --> 46:34.424
Sweet pea, I think this is your talent.

46:35.032 --> 46:37.262
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

46:37.367 --> 46:40.302
If you really want me to be happy,
you'll help me get to the mainland

46:40.404 --> 46:42.065
like you promised.

46:43.373 --> 46:46.570
Please, Tinker Bell, just think about it.

47:24.982 --> 47:28.076
Will you teach me how to be
a fast-flying fairy?

47:30.487 --> 47:32.682
Please? I know I could do it!

47:32.823 --> 47:36.554
With your help, I could be flying
as fast as you in no time.

47:36.793 --> 47:40.957
Vidia, you're my last hope.
All my friends have given up on me.

47:42.466 --> 47:46.197
Rosetta won't even try to teach me
to be a garden fairy now.

47:46.637 --> 47:51.404
I bet I could at least paint some flowers
or plant some sproutlings.

47:51.942 --> 47:54.775
I mean,
there must be something I could do.

47:57.548 --> 48:01.040
Or if you really want to be
a garden fairy...

48:11.895 --> 48:14.193
Capture the sprinting thistles.

48:15.299 --> 48:19.429
Well, okay. I can do this. Yeah!

48:21.605 --> 48:23.368
Okay. Ready, Cheese?

48:26.143 --> 48:28.270
Come on. They're just weeds.

48:30.714 --> 48:34.411
Besides, there were only
seven or eight at the most, right?

48:39.223 --> 48:40.315
Hyah!

48:45.095 --> 48:49.532
We can do this. I know we can do this.
What do you say?

48:53.470 --> 48:54.698
Attaboy.

49:05.182 --> 49:07.047
This ought to be good.

49:19.429 --> 49:20.521
Hey!

49:20.631 --> 49:23.191
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!

49:23.834 --> 49:28.396
Just a bit this way!
It's working! It's working!

49:36.480 --> 49:37.708
Come on!

49:45.222 --> 49:48.157
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back! Come back!

49:50.460 --> 49:56.330
These things just won't listen!
Come on, Cheese. Go, go, go!

50:02.172 --> 50:04.572
Okay, definitely more than eight.

50:06.443 --> 50:09.606
Please file into the corral
in an orderly manner!

50:12.582 --> 50:13.674
Wait!

50:16.420 --> 50:18.285
Oh, no! Come on!

50:24.428 --> 50:25.895
Come on, now.

50:35.505 --> 50:38.303
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. So sorry.

50:38.475 --> 50:40.375
This is the last batch.

50:44.548 --> 50:45.810
Look out!

50:46.216 --> 50:47.843
Sorry. Sorry!

51:41.638 --> 51:42.832
Oh, no.

51:43.006 --> 51:44.633
Tink. What happened?

51:44.741 --> 51:46.140
- I...
- Tinker Bell,

51:46.243 --> 51:47.642
what did you think you were doing?

51:47.744 --> 51:50.269
I was just... I was just trying to...

51:50.380 --> 51:52.405
I thought if I could capture
the thistles, then...

51:52.516 --> 51:56.179
There isn't a garden fairy alive
who can control those weeds!

51:56.286 --> 51:58.982
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

51:59.089 --> 52:02.024
She's right, Tink.
This has all gone too far.

52:05.962 --> 52:07.953
By the second star!

52:10.734 --> 52:13.931
All the preparations for spring...
How did this...

52:22.345 --> 52:27.339
Queen Clarion, it was me.

52:28.151 --> 52:30.517
I did it. It was all my fault.

52:31.521 --> 52:32.920
Tinker Bell.

52:34.124 --> 52:35.591
I...

52:36.593 --> 52:37.924
I'm sorry.

52:53.510 --> 52:55.944
I don't think we can
fix this in time.

52:56.046 --> 52:59.106
We're going to have to cancel spring,
or postpone it at the very least.

52:59.216 --> 53:01.480
What, and put my
snowflake fairies back to work? Oh, no.

53:01.585 --> 53:03.177
But we can't! We can't do that!

53:03.286 --> 53:04.446
If the snow isn't melted,

53:04.554 --> 53:06.647
the seedlings won't grow,
the fruit won't ripen in the summer...

53:06.756 --> 53:09.156
And in the autumn,
there will be nothing to harvest.

53:09.259 --> 53:10.624
Spring must happen on time,

53:10.727 --> 53:12.456
or the balance of nature
will be undone!

53:12.562 --> 53:15.656
There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!

53:15.765 --> 53:17.995
It has!
Did you ever hear of the Ice Age?

53:18.101 --> 53:20.069
Settle down, all of you.

53:20.871 --> 53:25.308
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

53:31.414 --> 53:33.814
- No.
- Oh, no.

53:33.917 --> 53:36.442
We were so close,
and now it's all gone.

53:36.553 --> 53:38.248
Who's going to paint
our leaves now?

53:38.355 --> 53:40.016
The apples and pumpkins
will never grow.

53:40.123 --> 53:42.114
No rolling hills
covered in daffodils?

53:42.225 --> 53:44.284
And it took months to harvest
all those seeds!

53:44.394 --> 53:45.827
Animals waking
from hibernation

53:45.929 --> 53:47.897
will have nothing to eat!

54:15.625 --> 54:17.149
You okay, Tink?

54:18.295 --> 54:20.388
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

54:21.364 --> 54:26.324
I just came hoping to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.

54:27.137 --> 54:28.104
Oh.

54:28.572 --> 54:32.668
- Well, how long you going to be gone?
- Well, actually, forever.

54:34.511 --> 54:36.240
Forever? Well,

54:37.881 --> 54:40.543
in that case,
a double scoop.

54:41.117 --> 54:43.779
Forever's a pretty long time, so I hear.

54:43.887 --> 54:45.377
Thanks, Terence.

54:45.488 --> 54:47.115
You know my name?

54:47.223 --> 54:49.589
Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

54:49.926 --> 54:52.656
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.

54:53.630 --> 54:56.724
I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.733
Terence, what are you talking about?

54:58.835 --> 55:01.269
You're probably the most important one
there is!

55:01.371 --> 55:03.669
Without you,
no one would have any magic!

55:03.773 --> 55:06.469
Why, your talent makes you
who you are!

55:07.010 --> 55:09.911
- You should be proud of it! I mean...
- I am.

55:18.688 --> 55:21.555
I'd better get going.

55:58.828 --> 56:00.227
Hey, Cheese.

56:02.565 --> 56:05.295
"Be proud of your talent." What talent?

56:05.802 --> 56:08.862
I couldn't even get
these silly things to work.

56:22.085 --> 56:23.484
Lost things.

56:38.935 --> 56:40.266
That's it!

56:49.779 --> 56:51.542
Attention, everyone!

56:53.249 --> 56:55.740
I'm afraid I have distressing news.

56:57.353 --> 57:00.151
There is no way spring
can come on time.

57:01.024 --> 57:03.322
Months of work was lost,

57:03.426 --> 57:05.986
and it will take us months
to restore it all.

57:06.730 --> 57:09.358
So when the Everblossom
opens tomorrow,

57:09.733 --> 57:13.430
I'm afraid we will not be going
to the mainland for spring.

57:15.538 --> 57:18.507
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

57:19.976 --> 57:21.375
Tinker Bell?

57:24.047 --> 57:25.981
Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...

57:26.082 --> 57:29.017
Just hear me out. Please.

57:30.153 --> 57:31.211
You!

57:34.524 --> 57:37.220
How long does it take you
to paint a ladybug?

57:37.327 --> 57:40.228
I don't know. 10, 15 minutes, I guess.

57:57.981 --> 58:01.747
See? We can build more.
I can show you how.

58:01.851 --> 58:05.548
Making paint, gathering seeds,
we can do it all in no time.

58:06.122 --> 58:08.090
We have to at least try!

58:08.925 --> 58:11.985
Wait a...
Are we really gonna listen to her?

58:12.262 --> 58:14.822
She's the reason we're in this mess
in the first place!

58:14.931 --> 58:16.762
But I can fix it.

58:16.866 --> 58:21.462
Yippee! Tinker Bell's going to save us
with her dopey little doohickeys.

58:21.971 --> 58:25.168
- Hide the squirrels!
- What is your problem, Vidia?

58:25.308 --> 58:27.037
Why do you think
you're so much better than me?

58:27.143 --> 58:30.601
I am better than you, sweetie.
I didn't ruin spring.

58:30.713 --> 58:32.806
At least now I'm trying to help.

58:32.916 --> 58:35.350
Have you ever helped anyone
besides yourself?

58:35.451 --> 58:37.248
Well, I tried to help you!

58:37.353 --> 58:39.253
Maybe I should have told you
to capture the hawk

58:39.355 --> 58:41.289
instead of the thistles!

58:48.991 --> 58:52.119
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not
the only one responsible.

58:54.163 --> 58:57.860
It seems to me that
your fast-flying talent is well-suited

58:57.967 --> 59:01.368
to chasing down each and every one
of the thistles.

59:01.704 --> 59:02.728
Me?

59:02.972 --> 59:06.533
Yes. And I expect them all
to be returned to Needlepoint Meadow

59:06.642 --> 59:07.631
as soon as possible.

59:07.743 --> 59:10.143
But that could take forever!

59:10.246 --> 59:12.544
Then I suggest you get started.

59:22.258 --> 59:26.695
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you sure you can do this?

59:29.699 --> 59:30.757
Yes.

59:32.101 --> 59:35.730
Because I'm a tinker. It's who I am.

59:37.740 --> 59:39.640
And tinkers fix things.

59:41.244 --> 59:43.212
But I can't do it alone.

59:46.682 --> 59:48.547
Command us, Miss Bell.

59:49.285 --> 59:51.276
- I'll help.
- Show us how, Tink!

59:51.387 --> 59:53.355
- I'll help you.
- Me, too!

59:53.623 --> 59:59.323
Okay, gather up all the twigs you can,
all different sizes, and tree sap.

59:59.428 --> 01:00:02.795
We need lots of that.
But most importantly,

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:06.426
we need to find lost things.

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:16.906
Okay, what have you got?

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.004
- How about this?
- Will this do?

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.208
Can you use this fuzzy thing,
Miss Bell?

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.682
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy.

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.219
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.752
Twig.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.451
Hammer.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:34.428
Magnification, please. Thank you.

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.600
And that's how you do it!

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.067
Now, what do you suppose the...

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.909
You smell funny.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:58.576
Oh!

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:03.023
- I saw it first.
- I bumped into it.

01:01:03.859 --> 01:01:05.850
Just tie this off here.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:10.994
So, you just squeeze this,
then let it go, and...

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:14.064
See? Simple!

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.301
Now, just put the berries in,

01:01:18.407 --> 01:01:20.466
and we'll have plenty of paint
in no time!

01:01:56.679 --> 01:02:00.080
Six, seven and eight.

01:02:56.505 --> 01:02:59.997
You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:02.775
We all did it.

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:06.041
Queen Clarion? Can't Tink
come with us to the mainland?

01:03:06.148 --> 01:03:09.174
Yeah, she's done so much
for everyone.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:12.853
No, no, you guys, really.
I don't need to go.

01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:15.613
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.285
It's okay. My work is here.

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.362
And I still have so much to do. I gotta...

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.226
Not here, you don't!

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.161
Well... But I don't...

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.499
Surprise, Miss Bell.

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:30.572
We found your tiny dancer!

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:35.440
Actually, I ran across this myself
many seasons ago.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:39.310
I didn't have a clue what it was
or how to fix it.

01:03:40.015 --> 01:03:45.214
But you did, Tinker Bell.
You are quite a rare talent indeed.

01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:50.418
And I'd imagine there's a little girl
out there who's missing this.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.128
What do you mean? How...

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:55.891
I think that perhaps
a certain tinker fairy

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:58.523
might have a job to do after all,

01:03:58.634 --> 01:03:59.931
on the mainland.

01:04:00.035 --> 01:04:01.559
You mean, I...

01:04:05.307 --> 01:04:06.604
I knew you'd get to go!
- Oh, Tink!

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.768
- We can help, Miss Bell.
- We can help. I'm strong.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:12.109
I'm so happy for you.
Come on. We gotta go line up.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.150
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:17.719
But how will I find who it belongs to?

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.720
You'll know. Now go!

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.330
Good heavens.

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:31.429
Thank you.

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:40.169
Tink. Hey,
something to help you on the mainland.

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.402
Terence, that's so sweet.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.608
Good luck, Tink.

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:52.977
To the air, fairies! To the air!
The mainland awaits!

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:59.560
<i>Come away</i>
<i>with me now to the sky</i>

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:03.564
<i>Up o'er the hills and the sea</i>

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:08.069
<i>Far beyond where our memories lie</i>

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:12.470
<i>To a place where I'm free to be me</i>

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:18.678
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

01:05:18.781 --> 01:05:23.480
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:28.353
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:33.360
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:39.530
<i>The blanket of snow is all gone</i>

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:43.503
<i>Each flower waits for the sun</i>

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:48.066
<i>And the whispering tears of the rain</i>

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:52.614
<i>Holds promise for everyone</i>

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:56.549
<i>Then come away with me friends</i>

01:05:56.652 --> 01:06:01.146
<i>No matter where you call your home</i>

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:05.023
<i>With a light in our hearts</i>
<i>We will never part</i>

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.992
Fairies to the north!

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:09.430
Fairies to the south!

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.395
To the east and west!

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:26.374
<i>Deep in the forest we go</i>

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.813
<i>The creatures are all fast asleep</i>

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:32.479
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Come on! There you go. Good squirrel.

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.351
<i>With a kiss and a wink</i>
<i>we will waken our souls</i>

01:06:34.456 --> 01:06:38.051
<i>While always their safety we'll keep</i>

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.960
<i>And then, then we'll dance</i>
<i>through the night</i>

01:06:42.097 --> 01:06:46.295
<i>Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn</i>

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:50.805
<i>And away we will go</i>
<i>Like last winter's snow</i>

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:54.467
<i>Soon our work will be done</i>

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:58.377
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.439
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:07.045
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

01:07:09.224 --> 01:07:13.422
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:30.834
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:34.973
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:39.714
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:44.225
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:57.795
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

01:09:54.288 --> 01:09:56.519
Mummy! Guess what, guess what!

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:59.024
Yes, Wendy.
What is it, darling?

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:07.498
<i>A fairy's work is</i>
<i>much more than,</i>

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:08.661
<i>at first, it might appear.</i>

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.136
You did it!

01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:14.668
<i>Suppose your broken clock ticks,</i>
<i>though it hasn't in a year.</i>

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:20.338
<i>Perchance you find a toy you lost,</i>
<i>or jingling bells you hear.</i>

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:28.487
<i>It all means that</i>
<i>one very special fairy might be near.</i>

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:49.505
<i>Watch all the flowers</i>
<i>dance with the wind</i>

01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:53.980
<i>Listen to snowflakes</i>
<i>whisper your name</i>

01:10:54.082 --> 01:10:57.609
<i>Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams</i>

01:10:57.719 --> 01:11:02.588
<i>You can fly</i>

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:06.855
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:11.023
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:15.467
<i>You believe you'll find your wings</i>

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:22.500
<i>Fly to your heart</i>

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:28.306
<i>Touch every rainbow painting the sky</i>

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:32.547
<i>Look at the magic glide</i>
<i>through your life</i>

01:11:32.654 --> 01:11:36.317
<i>A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night</i>

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:41.260
<i>You can fly</i>

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:45.663
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

01:11:45.767 --> 01:11:49.794
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:54.274
<i>When you believe</i>
<i>you'll find your wings</i>

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:57.937
<i>Fly</i>

01:11:58.046 --> 01:12:02.142
<i>You can fly</i>

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:06.449
<i>To your heart</i>

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:15.524
<i>Rise to the heights of all you can be</i>

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:24.268
<i>Soar on the hope of marvelous things</i>

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:28.742
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:32.905
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:37.281
<i>When you believe</i>
<i>you'll find your wings</i>

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:41.584
<i>Fly</i>

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:45.786
<i>Everywhere you go</i>

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:50.228
<i>Your soul will find a home</i>

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:56.007
<i>You'll be free
to spread your wings</i>

01:12:56.705 --> 01:13:00.266
<i>Fly</i>

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:07.338
<i>You can fly</i>

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:11.783
<i>To your heart</i>
