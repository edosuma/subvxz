WEBVTT

00:01.472 --> 00:04.205
HEY, IT'S OKAY. IT'S SCARY
TO MEET YOUR BOYFRIEND'S MOM.

00:04.205 --> 00:07.178
THIS IS SUCH A DISASTER.
NOT AT ALL.

00:07.178 --> 00:10.711
MY NOSE HAS STOPPED BLEEDING,
AND THIS IS AN OLD SHIRT.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.513
(chuckles)
I DID LOVE THAT VASE.

00:12.513 --> 00:16.016
I SWEAR, I TRIPPED ON
A MARBLE. I--
I KNOW. I MEAN, IT'S WEIRD

00:16.016 --> 00:19.790
THAT WE CAN'T FIND IT,
BUT I'M SURE IT'S REAL.

00:19.790 --> 00:22.353
HERE, MOM.
BABE, ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M FINE. I-I JUST GOT
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

00:22.353 --> 00:24.725
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
YOUR MOM IS TO YOU.

00:24.725 --> 00:28.129
I SEE HER PICTURE EVERY TIME
I'M IN YOUR BED. (chuckles)
YEAH. (chuckles)

00:28.129 --> 00:31.362
WAIT.
YOU'VE BEEN IN HIS BED?
I'M GONNA THROW UP.

00:31.362 --> 00:34.034
OH, AGAIN?
PLUS, TRAVIS SCARED ME.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
HE SAID THAT YOU ALWAYS
EMBARRASS HIM WHENEVER

00:36.036 --> 00:39.210
HE BRINGS A GIRL HOME.
TRAVIS, I SAID I WOULD
NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

00:39.210 --> 00:41.472
в™Є HI, KRISTEN в™Є
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:41.472 --> 00:43.344
WHAT WAS WHAT?
IT'S STARTING AGAIN.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.477
в™Є HI, KRISTEN в™Є
HI, KRISTEN!

00:46.477 --> 00:48.179
(gravely voice) HI, KRISTEN!

00:48.179 --> 00:50.321
(breathy voice)
HEY, KRISTEN.

00:50.321 --> 00:52.553
OKAY, EVERYBODY, BIG FINISH.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.726
(Andy, Bobby, Laurie, and Ellie)
в™Є HI, KRISTEN в™Є

00:55.726 --> 00:58.729
в™Є IT'S KIRSTEN,
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME WHATEVER в™Є

00:58.729 --> 01:00.791
в™Є I HATE THAT I'M SINGING в™Є

01:00.791 --> 01:03.294
SHE'S LIKE
A NERVOUS LITTLE BIRD.

01:03.294 --> 01:05.466
(grunts)
DID YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

01:05.466 --> 01:07.568
MAYBE, LIKE,
A GLASS OF WINE OR--
YES. (chuckles)

01:07.568 --> 01:10.571
WHOA, WHOA. HEY. GOTTA BE 21
TO DRINK IN THIS HOUSE.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.773
SHE'S A GRAD STUDENT.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.776
LET US HELP YOU GET YOUR BAG
UPSTAIRS AND UNLOAD.
YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, HERE.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.209
UH, THIS IS A LOT
OF LAUNDRY, PROBABLY.
YEAH, YEAH.

01:18.209 --> 01:20.211
OH, BOY, THIS IS HEAVY.
RIGHT. LET'S GO UNLOAD.

01:20.211 --> 01:22.513
YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE IDIOTS
ARE DOING, YES?

01:22.513 --> 01:24.515
(laughs) WHOO!
23, BABY! 23!

01:24.515 --> 01:25.816
RIGHT ON! YEAH!
WHOA!

01:25.816 --> 01:27.818
THAT IS MY BOY!
WHOO!

01:27.818 --> 01:30.691
WHOO!
WOW, HOW'D YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND
FROM HIGH SCHOOL TAKE IT?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.193
WAS SHE CRUSHED?

01:32.193 --> 01:33.764
YOU'LL BE BACK.

01:33.764 --> 01:35.766
LET'S GO, TURBO.

01:37.568 --> 01:40.571
YEAH, SHE WAS TOTALLY CRUSHED.
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

01:40.571 --> 01:44.135
I MEAN, KIRSTEN'S AMAZING.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

01:44.135 --> 01:45.436
YEAH. HOW AMAZING? LIKE...

01:45.436 --> 01:47.578
в™Є CHICKA-BOW-WOW в™Є

01:47.578 --> 01:50.381
HOW WOULD YOU GUYS RATE THAT
ON THE CREEPO METER?

01:50.381 --> 01:52.883
ABOUT INFINITY?
SCREW IT. SHE SAID
IT WAS THE BEST EVER.

01:52.883 --> 01:54.745
(high-pitched voice)
WHAT UP?!
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

01:54.745 --> 01:57.388
в™Є BOW CHICKA-BOW-WOW в™Є
HOW COMEHEGETS TO DO IT?

01:57.388 --> 01:58.849
HEY, HEY, HEY!
QUICK DAD MOMENT.

01:58.849 --> 02:01.552
TRAV, BE RESPONSIBLE.
REMEMBER MOM'S SONG?

02:01.552 --> 02:04.455
(all) в™Є IF YOU'RE HEADED
IN A SEXY DIRECTION в™Є

02:04.455 --> 02:06.497
в™Є YOU BETTER USE CONTRACEPTION в™Є

02:06.497 --> 02:09.560
в™Є 'CAUSE BABIES DESTROY
YOUR DREAMS в™Є
(strums chords)

02:09.560 --> 02:11.832
IT'S WEIRD THAT
WE ALL KNOW THAT SONG.

02:11.832 --> 02:15.135
ALL RIGHT, YOU KIDS MAKE
YOURSELF AT HOME.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.138
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.
EVERYBODY ELSE, LET'S CLEAR OUT.
OKAY.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.277
OKAY.
SO WHAT DO WE THINK OF HER?

02:26.277 --> 02:29.520
DO YOU THINK SHE WEARS PERHAPS
A SKOSH TOO MUCH MAKEUP?
MM-HMM.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.152
IMPOSSIBLE.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.626
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU POURED
YOUR MAKEUP ON THE FLOOR

02:35.626 --> 02:38.629
AND ROLLED AROUND IN IT.
POPPY, THE TRANSSEXUAL AT
THE MAKEUP COUNTER I FREQUENT,

02:38.629 --> 02:41.732
WOULD BEG TO DIFFER.
WELL, I LIKE KRISTEN.

02:41.732 --> 02:44.735
DO YOU HAVE ANY COOKIES?
NO, BUT HE DOES HIDE
CANDY BARS ON THE TOP SHELF

02:44.735 --> 02:48.469
BEHIND THE CEREAL.
SOMEONE'S GOT
AN EATING DISORDER.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.241
TOTALMANOREXIC.

02:50.241 --> 02:52.203
DOES HE HAVE
ANY COCONUT WATER?
OH!

02:52.203 --> 02:55.206
(Jules) COCONUT WATER...
(Andy) I GOT A HANKERING
FOR SOME JUICE.

02:55.206 --> 02:58.579
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST
LET THEM ALL IN HERE.
OH, I'M SORRY. I RARELY LISTEN
TO YOU. WHAT'D YOU SAY?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.951
ONCE THEY'RE IN,
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA LEAVE.

03:00.951 --> 03:03.454
THEY'RE LIKE
HUMAN BEDBUGS.

03:03.454 --> 03:04.915
ZONED AGAIN. WHAT?

03:04.915 --> 03:07.288
MMM. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.790
I THREW A QUICK LOAD
IN THE WASHER.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.292
(mouths word)

03:11.292 --> 03:13.764
(whispers) BEDBUGS.

03:13.764 --> 03:16.767
HEY, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO MY
DAD'S BOAT IF YOU'RE FEELING--

03:16.767 --> 03:19.270
I'M NOT TIRED. ALTHOUGH
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET A--

03:19.270 --> 03:20.771
GET A SWEATER?

03:20.771 --> 03:22.273
(chuckles) YEAH.

03:22.273 --> 03:24.275
I'LL WAIT HERE.

03:24.275 --> 03:25.776
OKAY.

03:25.776 --> 03:27.278
BE RIGHT BACK.

03:27.278 --> 03:29.410
(giggles)

03:29.410 --> 03:32.813
THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER

03:32.813 --> 03:35.316
FINISH MY SENTENCES
WAS MY FOSTER BROTHER.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.817
THAT'S WHY WE DATED.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.490
RELAX. WE WERE 10,

03:39.490 --> 03:42.893
AND HE MOVED BACK TO ROMANIA
BEFORE WE DID ANYTHING MAJOR.

03:42.893 --> 03:45.956
COME ON. SO SHE FINISHES
HIS SENTENCES. BIG DEAL.

03:45.956 --> 03:47.458
I CAN DO THAT.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.500
HEY, MOM. CAN YOU--
TOSS YOU AN APPLE? SURE.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.732
UH, NO, I JUST WANTED A--
BANANA. DONE.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.904
OKAY. STOP THROWING FRUIT.
JUST NEED A--

03:53.904 --> 03:56.907
BACON? BATTERIES! TISSUES. AH.
(singsongy) NAILED IT.

03:56.907 --> 03:59.740
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE INSIDE
MY BRAIN.

03:59.740 --> 04:03.714
FACE IT, JULES. YOU MET
THE MAN YOU MARRIED IN COLLEGE.

04:03.714 --> 04:07.678
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
TRAVIS IS 19. I WAS 19 1/2.

04:07.678 --> 04:09.920
BROTHER-KISSER IS RIGHT.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.684
ALL OF TRAVIS' GIRLFRIENDS NOW
ARE POTENTIAL DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW.

04:13.684 --> 04:15.986
THEN ONE OF THEM'S
GONNA CONVINCE TRAVIS

04:15.986 --> 04:18.389
TO YANK
YOUR FEEDING TUBE OUT.
(gasps)

04:18.389 --> 04:21.332
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO TO ME?

04:21.332 --> 04:24.465
I'M WINDING YOU UP LIKE
A TOY ROBOT AND LETTING YOU GO.

04:24.465 --> 04:28.469
(both imitate whirring sounds)

04:28.469 --> 04:30.571
LAURIE.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.943
I'M SORRY.
(imitates creak)

04:35.275 --> 04:38.008
WOW. SO IS YOUR DAD, LIKE,
SOME SORT OF ECCENTRIC GENIUS?

04:38.008 --> 04:41.752
YES.
EXCEPT FOR THE GENIUS PART.

04:41.752 --> 04:44.054
I COULD USE A LITTLE BREAK
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

04:44.054 --> 04:48.018
MAYBE TONIGHT WE COULD HANG OUT,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

04:48.018 --> 04:49.590
(chuckles)

04:49.590 --> 04:51.862
(high-pitched voice)
OH, GOD.

04:51.862 --> 04:54.465
WHY THE SAD SIGH?
YOU WEREN'T NAPPING?

04:54.465 --> 04:56.967
THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
LIKE SLEEPING IN A CLOUD,

04:56.967 --> 04:59.299
BUT IT'S JUST TERRIFYING.
WHOA! (grunts)

04:59.299 --> 05:02.773
(sighs) KIRSTEN AND I HAVE
ONLY BEEN TOGETHER ONCE,

05:02.773 --> 05:05.776
AND, YEAH, SHE SAID IT WAS
AMAZING, BUT I HAD A COLD.

05:05.776 --> 05:08.078
I WAS ALL GOOFY
ON COUGH SYRUP.

05:08.078 --> 05:10.441
DAD, I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT I DID.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.783
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF
I'M NO GOOD NEXT TIME?

05:12.783 --> 05:15.786
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT
A CLASSIC CASE OF R.P.A.--

05:15.786 --> 05:17.818
REPEAT PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.791
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR DAD'S
BATHROOM IS A FISH TANK?

05:20.791 --> 05:22.823
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

05:22.823 --> 05:24.625
IT'S OKAY!

05:24.625 --> 05:28.399
I GOT A SEAT BELT
ON THIS BAD BOY. OHH.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.901
I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA LOSE
TRAVIS SOMEDAY,

05:30.901 --> 05:33.904
BUT THE THOUGHT OF IT IS JUST
SO SCARY THAT SOMETIMES

05:33.904 --> 05:36.006
I ACT A LITTLE CRAZY.
DISAGREE WITH ME.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.608
OH, YOU DON'T.
NOT AT ALL.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.940
NO, NO. I DO.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.943
SOMEONE NEEDS TO STOP ME
BEFORE I DO SOMETHING STUPID.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.975
YOU NEED
A JULES COBB-STOPPER.

05:44.975 --> 05:47.077
LAURIE, YOU COULD BE
MY COBB-STOPPER.

05:47.077 --> 05:50.120
YOU CHOSEME?OHH.
WHAT'S UP, NUMBER TWO?

05:50.120 --> 05:53.384
HOW'S MY DUST TASTE?
(imitates engine revving)

05:53.384 --> 05:56.887
JULES KNOWS THAT IF I TALK
TO KRISTEN, SHE'LL JUST MENTION

05:56.887 --> 05:59.890
SOME INDIE BAND TO ME THAT I'VE
NEVER HEARD OF, AND THEN I'LL

05:59.890 --> 06:02.963
SEE HER HOT, YOUNG ASS, AND I'LL
HAVE TO PUNCH HER IN THE FACE.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.365
OH.
LAURIE, THIS IS
NOT GONNA BE EASY.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.868
I'M GONNA GET MEAN,
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,

06:07.868 --> 06:10.971
DO NOT STOP COBB-STOPPING!
THAT'S HARD TO SAY.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.973
(both)
DO NOT STOP COBB-STOPPING.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.706
OH! IT IS HARD TO SAY.
NOT FOR ME.

06:15.706 --> 06:18.579
OH, HEY, GUYS.

06:18.579 --> 06:22.082
SO I COOKED US A LITTLE
FAMILY DINNER FOR TONIGHT.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.085
OOH. KIRSTEN ACTUALLY WANTED ME
TO TAKE HER OUT FOR PIZZA.
OH.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.058
BUT WHATEVER. I-IT'S COOL.
WHATEVER. I CAN DO WHATEVER.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.561
NO. ME WHATEVER. IT'S--
IT'S COOL. WHATEVER.

06:30.561 --> 06:32.723
NO. I MEAN, WHATEVER.
WH-WHATEVER YOU WANT, TRAVIS.

06:32.723 --> 06:34.825
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE JOB
FOR TWO SECONDS,

06:34.825 --> 06:37.828
AND SHE'S ALREADY ASKING HER SON
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS MOTHER

06:37.828 --> 06:39.830
AND THE CUTE BLONDE
THAT HE'S DOINKING.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.972
WELL, YEAH, I THINK WE'RE
GONNA STICK WITH THE PIZZA.

06:41.972 --> 06:44.575
NO BIGGIE.
MORE FOR ME. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

06:44.575 --> 06:47.538
SWEETIE,
DO YOU NEED BIG JOE?

06:47.538 --> 06:49.540
HE'LL NEVER LEAVE.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.112
OKAY. OKAY.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.746
OHH. THANK YOU.

06:55.746 --> 06:58.188
GOD, I LOVE YOU.

06:58.188 --> 07:00.190
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:08.959 --> 07:10.130
(laughs)

07:10.130 --> 07:12.132
GIVE ME THAT.
AW!

07:12.132 --> 07:13.964
"AW, YOU'RE A DOODLEBUG."
"NO, YOU'RE A DOODLEBUG."
(giggles)

07:13.964 --> 07:16.066
"OH! NIBBLY-FACE."

07:16.066 --> 07:17.908
(giggles) UGH.

07:17.908 --> 07:20.571
OH, HEY, MOM.
HEY, GUYS.

07:20.571 --> 07:23.514
KIRSTEN MADE SCONES.

07:23.514 --> 07:26.647
THEY'RE MY GRANNY'S RECIPE.
SHE TAUGHT ME BEFORE SHE DIED.

07:26.647 --> 07:30.180
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
OH, OKAY. SEE YA.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.037
SHE MADE SCONES, GRAYSON.

07:47.037 --> 07:48.999
OHH. THANK YOU.

07:48.999 --> 07:51.101
KRISTEN SAID
THAT HER GRANDMOTHER

07:51.101 --> 07:53.804
GAVE HER THE RECIPE
RIGHTBEFORE SHE DIED.

07:53.804 --> 07:56.807
REALLY? YOU KNOW, WHEN MY SOUL
IS BEING RIPPED FROM MY BODY,

07:56.807 --> 07:59.810
I'M GONNA BE YELLING, "NO, NO!
PLEASE! I'M NOT READY YET!"

07:59.810 --> 08:03.183
I'M NOT TEACHING PEOPLE
HOW TO MAKE SCONES.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.816
2... TABLESPOONS... BUTTER.
(groans)

08:05.816 --> 08:07.818
OW! GET--GET OFF ME.

08:07.818 --> 08:09.990
WHY IS TOM HERE?

08:09.990 --> 08:13.023
HIS HOUSE WAS SPRAYED
BY THAT SKUNK

08:13.023 --> 08:15.896
THAT'S IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
SMELLS SO BAD, I JUST SIT
IN MY YARD ALL DAY.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.498
AM I PART OF GANG NOW?
CALM DOWN. WE'LL SEE.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.501
GRAYSON, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE BEING A VERY GOOD HOST.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.704
GO MAKE SOME COFFEE.
YEAH, GO MAKE SOME COFFEE.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.136
CREAM, NO SUGAR.
THAT'D BE GREAT.
I'D LIKE A TEA.

08:26.136 --> 08:29.810
(newspaper thuds)
TOM CAN HAVE MY PLACE
IN THE GANG.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.114
(cell phone rings)

08:34.114 --> 08:35.986
(gasps) UH, WHAT? OHH.

08:35.986 --> 08:38.048
(ring, beep)

08:38.048 --> 08:41.151
KRISTEN IS TRYING TO
BATTLE ME FOR TRAVIS'S SOUL.

08:41.151 --> 08:44.154
IS SHE REALLY?
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT SHE BAKES STUFF.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.897
I'M HEADING BACK OVER THERE.
I NEED MY COBB-STOPPER.

08:46.897 --> 08:49.159
HEY, WHERE'S GRAYSON?

08:54.565 --> 08:56.066
SORRY.

08:56.066 --> 08:59.139
I ONLY HAVE
ONE COFFEE CUP.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.211
WHY AREN'T YOU LEAVING?

09:01.211 --> 09:03.914
OOH, THIS IS FUN.
I FEEL JAPANESE.

09:03.914 --> 09:05.916
(all)IRASSHAIMASE!
(door opens)

09:05.916 --> 09:08.919
HEY, DAD, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SEC?

09:08.919 --> 09:12.222
I ONLY HAVE, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE JOGGING.

09:12.222 --> 09:14.925
I KNOW TALKING ABOUT SEX
CAN BE TOUGH...

09:14.925 --> 09:17.327
(chuckles) BUT YOU LOOK
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

09:17.327 --> 09:20.130
HEY, THIS IS GUY TALK, BUDDY.
THEY'RE GUYS.

09:20.130 --> 09:23.093
NOW THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO HELP
IS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW I MAKE

09:23.093 --> 09:26.136
ROMANCE WITH THE LADIES.
G-LOVE, ON MY LAP.

09:26.136 --> 09:28.939
YOU PICKED HIM?
COME ON. HE'S JUST A LITTLE
MORE FEMININE THAN YOU.

09:28.939 --> 09:31.942
I ONLY SHAVE MY LEGS
TO SWIM FASTER.
OKAY, THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

09:31.942 --> 09:35.105
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO HANDLE IT ON MY OWN.

09:35.105 --> 09:38.849
WELL, IF YOU NEED ME,
GRAYSON'S DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.
(gear shifts, engine whirs)

09:38.849 --> 09:41.782
TRAV, BEING GOOD AT SEX ISN'T
SOMETHING YOU CAN LEARN.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.955
YOU GOTTA BE BORN WITH IT,
AND LET'S JUST SAY,

09:44.955 --> 09:47.287
I'VE GOT THE GIFT.
HE DOES.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.960
MY WINDOW FACES
YOUR WINDOW.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.261
OHH. GO HOME, TOM.

09:51.261 --> 09:52.963
OKAY.
OKAY.

09:52.963 --> 09:54.965
THE CLICHГ©
WHEN YOU'RE WITH A WOMAN

09:54.965 --> 09:57.327
IS TO THINK ABOUT BASEBALL,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR ME?

09:57.327 --> 09:59.800
I ALWAYS JUST IMAGINE HER
WITHOUT A FACE.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.773
I THINK I ACTUALLY READ THAT TIP
IN TED BUNDY'S BIOGRAPHY.

10:02.773 --> 10:04.805
THANKS
FOR THE HORRIBLE ADVICE,

10:04.805 --> 10:07.007
BUT I HAVE GET BACK
FROM MY JOG NOW.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.039
AH.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.343
OH. HI.

10:13.343 --> 10:16.647
(chuckles) YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THAT MARBLE, AREN'T YOU?
YEAH.

10:16.647 --> 10:18.849
OH.
I'M AN IDIOT.

10:18.849 --> 10:21.952
(door opens)
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT. I AM SO GLAD
THAT YOU CAME TO VISIT.

10:21.952 --> 10:24.795
(door closes)
YOU'RE SO NICE. TRAV AND I
REALLY WANTED TO COME

10:24.795 --> 10:27.327
THIS WEEKEND, IN CASE WE GO TO
SEE MY PARENTS FOR THANKSGIVING.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.130
OH!
(gasps) OH, NO. NO.
JUST BREATHE, JULES.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.833
I'M GONNA HEAD UPSTAIRS
AND TAKE A QUICK SHOWER.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.806
DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE TRAV IS?

10:35.806 --> 10:38.168
(chuckles) WELL,
YOU'RE SUCH A CONTROL FREAK

10:38.168 --> 10:41.071
ABOUT HOW HE'S GONNA SPEND
HIS HOLIDAYS, YOU TELL ME.
WHAT--WHAT'S HAPPENING?

10:41.071 --> 10:43.273
JUST SHOWER,
AND DON'T LOOK BACK.

10:43.273 --> 10:46.116
THERE IS NO MARBLE,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

10:46.116 --> 10:49.950
OKAY, LAURIE, I'VE GOT
MORE TO SAY TO HER.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.252
WOULD YOU GET OUT
OF MY WAY?!
NO! I AM COBB-STOPPING!

10:52.252 --> 10:55.125
WHEN YOU GET LIKE THIS,
YOU CAN'T PULL OUT OF IT,

10:55.125 --> 10:58.128
AND YOU ALWAYS REGRET IT.
LIAR! (sighs) I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M SURPRISED.

10:58.128 --> 11:00.360
YOU LIE TO THE WORLD
EVERY SINGLE DAY

11:00.360 --> 11:02.432
WITH YOUR CHEAP DYE JOB.

11:02.432 --> 11:04.735
IT'S SO YELLOW,
IT LOOKS LIKE CHICKEN FAT.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.437
YOU SAID YOU'D BE MEAN,
BUT, WOW, THAT CUT LIKE A KNIFE.

11:07.437 --> 11:09.399
(exhales deeply)

11:09.399 --> 11:13.143
(pants) JUST KNOCKED OUT A 4K.
WHEW. WHERE'S KIRSTEN?

11:13.143 --> 11:16.777
I THINK SHE'S UPSTAIRS.
OH. COOL.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.308
WHERE DID LAURIE GO?

11:18.308 --> 11:22.112
(curtain rattles)
WE NEED TO TALK.
NICE SHOULDERS.

11:22.112 --> 11:23.714
THANKS?

11:23.714 --> 11:26.757
IF YOU WANT MY HELP,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK.

11:26.757 --> 11:29.019
PLEASE HELP ME. PLEASE.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.221
BOBBY'S COVERING MY KITCHEN
IN NEWSPAPER

11:31.221 --> 11:33.724
AND SHARPENING A KNIFE.
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

11:33.724 --> 11:37.197
HE'S PROBABLY JUST
GUTTING A BOAR.
THEY WON'T LEAVE. HOW COME
THEY NEVER HANG OUT HERE?

11:37.197 --> 11:40.070
YOU HAVE TO BUILD SOME KIND
OF BARRIER TO KEEP THEM OUT.
(door opens and closes)

11:40.070 --> 11:43.133
HEY, ELLIE, DO YOU GOT
ANY MORE OF THAT--
(lowered voice)
SHH! STAN'S SLEEPING.

11:43.133 --> 11:45.205
(whispers) SORRY. OKAY.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.078
(door opens and closes)
(whispers)
LIKE, WHAT KIND OF BARRIER?

11:48.078 --> 11:50.080
(normal voice)
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHISPER,

11:50.080 --> 11:52.783
'CAUSE STAN'S AT THE PARK
WITH THE NANNY.

11:52.783 --> 11:55.245
(lowered voice) WOW.
I'M, LIKE, DOWN HERE,

11:55.245 --> 11:58.718
AND YOU'RE, LIKE, UP HERE.
EVENHIGHER.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.491
LOOK, JULES HAS
SOME TRAVIS ISSUES,

12:01.491 --> 12:04.925
SO SHE'S GONNA STEAMROLL YOU.
SHE'S LIKE A SHARK, KRISTEN.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.928
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO
WHEN A SHARK COMES AT YOU?

12:07.928 --> 12:09.960
(clicks tongue)
YOU PUNCH IT IN THE NOSE.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.102
CAN I HAVE MY CLOTHES BACK?

12:12.102 --> 12:14.805
JULES IS THREATENED BY YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE 23,

12:14.805 --> 12:17.107
BUT, HONEY, YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A LITTLE KID.

12:17.107 --> 12:20.240
IF I BUSTED INTO MY SHOWER
AND TOOK MY CLOTHES FROM ME,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.473
I'D BE ALL, "GIMME BACK
MY CLOTHES, YOU SEXY TOWNIE HO!"

12:23.473 --> 12:25.475
GO AHEAD. YOU TRY IT.

12:25.475 --> 12:29.249
GIMME BACK MY CLOTHES,
YOU SEXY GIRL!
N--

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
I LEFT OUT
THE "TOWNIE HO" PART,

12:31.251 --> 12:33.253
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE BEING NICE TO ME,

12:33.253 --> 12:36.126
EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE DOING IT
IN A SCARY, THREATENING WAY.

12:36.126 --> 12:38.128
OH, BOY. OKAY. HERE YOU GO.

12:38.128 --> 12:40.130
THANK YOU.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.462
JUST REMEMBER, SHARK PUNCH.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.134
(thud)
(gasps)

12:44.134 --> 12:46.937
(gasps) OH!
OH, MY GOD.

12:46.937 --> 12:49.539
WHOA. COLD FEET.
(chuckles)

12:49.539 --> 12:52.172
(chuckles) I MISSED YOU.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.274
COME HERE.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.445
UH...

12:55.445 --> 12:58.008
(whispering) I'M SORRY.

12:58.008 --> 13:01.211
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST, MY MOM'S
RIGHT DOWN THE HALLWAY,

13:01.211 --> 13:03.854
AND I'M STILL PRETTY ZONKED
FROM THAT JOG.

13:03.854 --> 13:05.856
OH. ALL RIGHT.

13:05.856 --> 13:08.088
WHY AM I
SUCH A FITNESS FANATIC?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.789
(chuckles)

13:18.028 --> 13:20.300
(whispers)
THIS PLACE SUCKS.

13:23.273 --> 13:25.275
(latch rattles)

13:25.275 --> 13:28.238
(sighs) THE WINDOW'S A NO-GO.
TRY THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

13:28.238 --> 13:31.241
(doorbell ringing)

13:31.241 --> 13:34.514
(whirring)

13:34.514 --> 13:36.416
(Andy) OH.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.218
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
GOOD.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.551
(thudding in distance)

13:45.455 --> 13:47.157
OHH! WHOA!

13:47.157 --> 13:49.529
(smacks lips)
WE JUST CAME BY TO WATCH
THE "DESIGNING WOMEN"

13:49.529 --> 13:52.102
WE RECORDED.
MAN, BACK IN THE DAY,

13:52.102 --> 13:54.404
DELTA BURKE WAS
REALLY BRINGIN' IT.
POW! POW!

13:54.404 --> 13:57.237
I HAVE A BAD BACK.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.939
(sighs)

13:58.939 --> 14:01.171
AH, GOOD MORNING,
EARLY BIRD.

14:01.171 --> 14:03.473
OH, SPEAKING OF BIRDS, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT THANKSGIVING,

14:03.473 --> 14:06.476
AND IF YOU WANT TRAVIS
TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE,

14:06.476 --> 14:09.479
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CUT HIM
OUT OF MY ARMS.

14:09.479 --> 14:11.851
ORANGE JUICE?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.524
NO, THANKS. I THINK I'LL
HAVE SOME BREAKFAST WINE.

14:14.524 --> 14:17.057
YOU CAN'T DRINK MY WINE.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.059
I BROUGHT THIS WINE
AS A GIFT,

14:19.059 --> 14:21.061
THEREFORE IT IS MY WINE,

14:21.061 --> 14:24.895
AND I WILL DRINK WHATEVER
I WANT, YOU SEXY TOWNIE HO.

14:24.895 --> 14:27.197
(mouths word)
I WOULDN'T.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.599
(gasps)

14:29.599 --> 14:33.503
(thunder rumbles)

14:33.503 --> 14:36.206
HOW COOL IS THAT
WITH THE SHEET?

14:36.206 --> 14:39.409
(rumbling)

14:45.255 --> 14:46.556
THIS IS MY FAULT.

14:46.556 --> 14:50.060
I GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION
THAT I'M SOME KIND OF KID,

14:50.060 --> 14:52.292
BUT I'M A WOMAN, JULES.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.125
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE WINE,
DO YOU?
YES, I DO.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.627
I'VE JUST NEVER HAD IT RIGHT
AFTER BRUSHING MY TEETH.

14:57.627 --> 15:00.030
I'VE HAD IT
WHILEBRUSHING MY TEETH.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.973
WELL, THAT'S ONE FOR JULES.
TRAVIS IS TOO YOUNG
TO DRINK.

15:02.973 --> 15:05.675
YOU'D BETTER NOT BE
ENCOURAGING HIM.
I DON'T LET HIM DRINK.

15:05.675 --> 15:08.408
OOH! THAT'S ONE FOR KRISTEN.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.941
YOU DON'T DECIDE
WHAT MY SON CAN DO.

15:10.941 --> 15:14.344
TRAVIS, GET DOWN HERE
AND HAVE A GLASS OF WINE!
YOU KNOW WHAT, JULES? I--OH.

15:14.344 --> 15:17.187
(thud)
(high-pitched voice) OH!

15:17.187 --> 15:20.150
MARBLE! I TOLD YOU!
(marble clatters)

15:20.150 --> 15:22.993
WELL, AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T
BREAK ANYTHING THIS TIME.
PSHAW.

15:22.993 --> 15:24.624
(slow motion voice) NO!

15:24.624 --> 15:28.358
BIG JOE!

15:32.002 --> 15:35.605
OH, MY GOD!
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

15:35.605 --> 15:37.507
HE WAS FAMILY.

15:37.507 --> 15:39.539
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.571
YOUR UNCLE JOE IS DEAD,
BUT YOU'RE ALLOWED

15:41.571 --> 15:44.274
TO START DRINKING.
(singsongy)
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

15:44.274 --> 15:47.577
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN THERE
FOR ME ONCE THIS WEEKEND!
(normal voice) KRISTEN.

15:47.577 --> 15:50.180
IT'SKIRSTEN!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:50.180 --> 15:54.124
I'M SORRY, LAURIE. I CANNOT
DO WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

15:54.124 --> 15:55.425
KRI--KIRSTEN.

15:55.425 --> 15:58.288
WHAT'D YOU TELL HER TO DO,
CHICKEN FAT?

15:58.288 --> 16:00.660
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
I WANT TO ENJOY THIS.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.292
GO.

16:02.292 --> 16:05.165
HEY. DON'T EVER KNOCK.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.666
I DIDN'T.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.639
TRAV TELLS ME THAT YOU GUYS
FILLED HIS HEAD WITH TALL TALES

16:09.639 --> 16:12.172
ABOUT HOW GREAT YOU GUYS ARE
IN THE SACK.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.205
WE'RE GONNA TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
ME FIRST.
PLEASE DON'T.

16:15.205 --> 16:18.208
TRAV, I'M BAD AT SEX. THERE'S
A LOT OF THRASHIN' AND THUMPIN',

16:18.208 --> 16:21.211
BUT NOTHIN' REALLY GETS DONE.
I'M LIKE A BROKEN DISHWASHER.

16:21.211 --> 16:24.214
ANDY, YOU'RE UP.
OKAY, FINE. (sighs)
I GET SUCH PRE-SEX JITTERS

16:24.214 --> 16:26.456
THAT I HAVE TO DO
A CONFIDENCE DANCE.

16:26.456 --> 16:29.059
G-MAN, TAKE US HOME.

16:29.059 --> 16:31.061
I GET SO TERRIFIED OF
LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS,

16:31.061 --> 16:33.063
THAT MY BUTT GETS
REALLY COLD.

16:33.063 --> 16:36.326
NOW I CAN ONLY HOOK UP
UNDER, LIKE, TONS OF BLANKETS

16:36.326 --> 16:38.698
OR WITH, LIKE,
A HOT WATER BOTTLE ON IT OR...

16:38.698 --> 16:41.701
YOU SEE, TRAV,
THAT'S WHAT BEING A MAN IS--

16:41.701 --> 16:44.204
LIVING IN CONSTANT FEAR
OF DISAPPOINTING A WOMAN.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.676
WELL, THANKS FOR THE ADVICE,
DAD, ANDY, CHILLY TUSH,

16:46.676 --> 16:49.679
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.
KIRSTEN ALREADY HATES ME.

16:49.679 --> 16:52.312
MM.
IT'S NOT COLD NOW, WEIRDO!

16:52.312 --> 16:55.014
ACTUALLY, IT IS COLD.
IT'S A LITTLE COLD.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.316
IT IS?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.248
YEAH.

16:58.248 --> 17:01.321
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WENT
BEHIND MY BACK AND TOLD HER

17:01.321 --> 17:04.494
TO STAND UP TO ME!
(grunts) HOW ARE YOU
THIS TINY AND THIS STRONG?

17:04.494 --> 17:07.627
YOU'RE LIKE AN ANT.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON MY SIDE.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.330
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, JULES.
COME ON.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.802
WHAT'S GOING ON?
(door closes)

17:12.802 --> 17:16.366
I BLEW IT WITH KIRSTEN.
EVERYBODY IN THE KITCHEN.
THEY NEED TO TALK.

17:16.366 --> 17:18.138
NO.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.810
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
TOM!

17:20.810 --> 17:22.742
(whispers) I'M READING.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.274
FINE.

17:24.274 --> 17:26.576
I PUSHED KIRSTEN AWAY
OVER SOMETHING SO DUMB!

17:26.576 --> 17:29.449
в™Є YOU ARE REALLY DUMB в™Є

17:29.449 --> 17:32.282
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIX IT.

17:32.282 --> 17:35.225
WELL, WE COULD RUN AWAY
TOGETHER.

17:35.225 --> 17:38.328
(laughs) WHAT?
I'M JUST KIDDING.

17:38.328 --> 17:41.131
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

17:41.131 --> 17:44.234
YOU ANDKIRSTENARE SO CLOSE
THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT

17:44.234 --> 17:47.237
COULD'VE HAPPENED IN TWO DAYS
THAT WOULD EVER CHANGE THAT.

17:47.237 --> 17:50.440
REALLY. YOU JUST NEED
TO GO TALK TO HER.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.472
OKAY.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.175
THANKS FOR BEING
SO COOL TO HER.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.347
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

17:57.347 --> 17:59.409
NO.
OH. THEN YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:59.409 --> 18:01.281
WE FIX IT?

18:01.281 --> 18:04.184
YEAH.
(sighs)

18:04.184 --> 18:07.187
HEY, CHILLY TUSH.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.818
THAT SPREAD QUICKLY.

18:08.818 --> 18:11.861
SO IT'S OFFICIAL. I HAVE TO WALK
THE STREETS TO GET ANY PEACE.

18:11.861 --> 18:13.363
YOU MUST BE HAPPY.

18:13.363 --> 18:16.426
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK
I ENJOY WATCHING THEM FAIL?

18:16.426 --> 18:18.128
BECAUSE YOU DO.

18:18.128 --> 18:20.770
THAT'S TRUE, BUT OUR HOUSES
OUR LIKE DOMINOES.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.772
IF YOURS FALLS,
MINE IS NEXT.

18:22.772 --> 18:25.205
YA GOTTA GET THEM OUT.
FIND A WAY.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.237
(whispers) SKUNK.

18:29.379 --> 18:32.142
(whispers) FIND A WAY.

18:33.713 --> 18:37.247
AAH!

18:39.789 --> 18:41.291
(door closes)

18:41.291 --> 18:45.255
(all screaming)

18:45.255 --> 18:48.398
(chuckles) IMAGINARY HAT.

18:48.398 --> 18:50.560
IMAGINARY CLOWN NOSE.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.632
MERP, MERP! (chuckles)

18:52.632 --> 18:54.334
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.336
WHY DOES NOBODY GET THIS?

18:58.268 --> 19:00.570
I'M SO SORRY FOR BEING
SUCH A--

19:00.570 --> 19:04.143
INSECURE JERK.
YOU'RE STILL FINISHING
MY SENTENCES.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.246
I'M GONNA GO
GRAB MY WALLET,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.248
THROW ON
SOME SWEET BODY SPRAY--

19:08.248 --> 19:11.251
NO BODY SPRAY--
THEN WE'RE GOING OUT.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.386
SO HAVE YOU HAD
A FUN WEEKEND HERE?

19:16.386 --> 19:18.628
OH, YEAH.
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

19:18.628 --> 19:20.930
WILL YOU COME SIT WITH ME,
PLEASE?

19:20.930 --> 19:23.293
DON'T BE AFRAID. COME HERE.

19:23.293 --> 19:26.766
I KNOW THAT I CAN GET CRAZY
WHEN IT COMES TO TRAVIS.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.768
I MEAN,
EVERYONE IS SICK OF IT.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.700
IT'S REALLY BAD.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.703
I KNOW, BUT THE UPSIDE OF HAVING
A BOYFRIEND WITH A PSYCHO MOM

19:33.703 --> 19:36.706
IS THAT I'VE TAUGHT HIM
TO BE THE TYPE OF GUY

19:36.706 --> 19:39.178
THAT SOMEONE LIKE YOU
WOULD WANT TO BE WITH.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.181
SO THE WAY HE ALWAYS OPENS
THE DOOR FOR ME?
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.714
HOW HE NEVER LOOKS
AT OTHER GIRLS?
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:44.714 --> 19:48.418
THE WAY HE KISSES?

19:48.418 --> 19:50.960
YEAH. YOU'RE WELCOME.
I DID TEACH HIM...

19:50.960 --> 19:53.293
(door opens and closes)
ON HIS TEDDY BEAR,
SO I'M ROLLING WITH IT.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.195
WHAT'S UP? MY PLACE
IS A STINK PIT. (chuckles)

19:56.195 --> 19:58.298
OKAY. GRAB ME A SODA.
THANKS.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.330
LET ME SAY YES FIRST.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.731
YES.

20:01.731 --> 20:04.404
SEE, WE WOMEN HAVE
A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.407
WE HAVE THE POWER TO CONTROL
THE MEN IN OUR LIVES.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.310
I SAID SODA, NOTSLOWDA!

20:10.310 --> 20:12.312
DON'T ABUSE IT LIKE I DO.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.285
BE NICE TO MY BOY.

20:15.285 --> 20:16.816
I PROMISE, JULES.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.548
THANKS.

20:18.548 --> 20:21.891
I DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT THIS
CONVERSATION IS ABOUT, DO I?

20:21.891 --> 20:23.393
NO, YOU DON'T, SWEETIE.

20:23.393 --> 20:26.296
OOH. LESS ICE.
LET ME SAY YES, DAMN IT.

20:26.296 --> 20:27.757
YES.

20:27.757 --> 20:29.929
MEN. JEEZ.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.737
WE ARE ALL HERE

20:37.737 --> 20:40.340
TO PAY RESPECT TO BIG JOE.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.743
(voice breaks) HE WAS ALWAYS
THERE FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED HIM.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.615
ELLIE.

20:45.615 --> 20:48.278
I REMEMBER
WHEN I FIRST MET BIG JOE.

20:48.278 --> 20:51.621
HE WAS HOLDING 8,000 PENNIES
IN AN ANTIQUE STORE.

20:51.621 --> 20:55.985
I WALKED RIGHT BY, BUT JULES--
SHE GAVE HIM A HOME.

20:55.985 --> 20:58.428
(voice breaks) I'LL SEE YA
AT THE CROSSROADS, HOMEY.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.490
I KNOW WE WEREN'T DATING,

21:00.490 --> 21:02.992
BUT I BURIED BOTH
OF MY PARENTS LAST YEAR,

21:02.992 --> 21:05.365
AND NONE OF YOU CAME.

21:07.437 --> 21:08.738
ANYWAY,

21:08.738 --> 21:10.570
WITH GOOD-BYES

21:10.570 --> 21:12.772
COME NEW BEGINNINGS.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.405
EVERYONE, SAY HELLO

21:15.405 --> 21:17.347
TO BIG CARL.

21:17.347 --> 21:19.409
(Ellie and Laurie) OHH.
REST IN PEACE, BIG JOE.

21:19.409 --> 21:22.412
(sniffles) WE'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER THE GOOD TIMES.

21:22.412 --> 21:25.415
в™Єв™Єв™Є
