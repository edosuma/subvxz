00:02.440 --> 00:03.350
<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:03.520 --> 00:05.078
Know what I like about rich kids?

00:05.720 --> 00:06.914
- Nothing. 
- Let me meet you upstairs.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.069
- Summer?
- Anna?

00:08.240 --> 00:09.832
- Seth?
- The gruesome twosome.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.753
You spent the weekend painting
Jimmy's house, and I didn't say a word...

00:12.920 --> 00:15.229
...because I knew nothing was going on.
- Of course.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.194
Do I have a fever?

00:49.360 --> 00:51.715
I think I might have a fever
and/or the chills.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.872
- Since when?
- Since recently.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.474
So you're not feeling well?

00:57.640 --> 00:59.756
No, I feel fine.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.432
Just my head's a little achy
and my stomach's kind of weird. I'm okay.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.873
Come here.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.279
- You don't feel warm.
- What about cold or clammy?

01:10.440 --> 01:14.592
- Maybe you've got the summer flu.
- Yeah. It's November, but it's possible.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.796
Maybe you need some Anna-biotics.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.231
- Do you not want to go to school?
- No, Dad. I want to go to school. Okay?

01:24.160 --> 01:26.594
- I'm just worried about infecting others.
- You're right.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.479
We should just take you
straight to the emergency room.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.629
Just to be sure.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.590
Okay. Or I could stay home
and try and sleep it off.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.070
Or you could go to school,
face Summer and Anna and apologize.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.357
First of all, no.
Second of all, no.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.158
Why would I?

01:44.320 --> 01:47.118
Oh, the Summer flu.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.272
I just got it. That was good.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.352
It's not my fault that they both
tried to kiss me on Thanksgiving.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.272
What was I supposed to do?
Not kiss back?

01:55.440 --> 01:57.351
Say "No, stop"?
Risk hurting their feelings?

01:57.520 --> 02:00.034
Well, it seems you already did
hurt their feelings.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.078
Yeah, perhaps I did,
but what about my feelings, okay?

02:03.240 --> 02:05.310
I was the one who was assaulted.
I'm the victim.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.948
Hey, how come you're not dressed?
You're gonna be late.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.669
And so are you. Or is that what ladies
are wearing these days to Yogalates?

02:11.840 --> 02:15.435
Taryn called to remind you that today is
the first day of your Yogalates workshop.

02:15.920 --> 02:20.357
- Okay. Mom, Yogalates?
- I don't know if I'm gonna go.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.590
- I'm not feeling well.
- See? It's contagious.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.274
You know, honey, you might
still be a little hung-over.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.429
From what?

02:26.600 --> 02:29.034
I don't know. Getting drunk
and passing out on Thanksgiving?

02:29.200 --> 02:32.237
Hey, I had two glasses of wine.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.719
Three.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.189
I'm sure Julie Cooper
has spread word around town...

02:36.360 --> 02:38.032
...that I now have a drinking problem.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.077
Which is why you
have to go to Yogalates.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.119
Because you know those chatty Newpsies
will assume you're sleeping off a bender.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.748
And Summer and Anna
will assume you're afraid of them.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.992
Hey, I'm not afraid of Summer
and Anna, all right?

02:50.160 --> 02:52.720
- Well, I'm not afraid of Anna.
- So you're going to school.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.950
- And you're going to Yogalates.
- You like saying that.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.350
Yogalates? I kind of do.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.078
- Yogalates.
- Yogalates.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.755
You know what I want to know,
is why these two are so smug.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.309
Because for once,
they didn't do anything wrong?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.159
That's true.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.592
- Here's to you.
- Back at you.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.952
Enjoy it, boys,
because knowing the two of you...

03:14.120 --> 03:15.951
...it won't last long.
- Yogalates.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.197
Your class presentations will account
for one-third of your final grade...

03:50.360 --> 03:54.399
...along with your term papers
and, of course, the final exam.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.472
I'll be dividing the class
into two-person teams.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.553
Each team will be responsible
for presenting a detailed account...

04:01.720 --> 04:06.077
...of a pivotal event or period
in European history.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.595
I've already had quite a few
partnership requests...

04:09.960 --> 04:12.155
...however,
in fairness to the other students...

04:12.320 --> 04:15.039
...I will select the teams myself
at random.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.760
Lauren and Kenny,
the French Revolution.

04:18.720 --> 04:23.077
Ryan and Luke,
the Spanish Inquisition.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.312
Stephanie and Bobby,
the Protestant Reformation.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.277
Stephanie? Are you listening?

04:28.440 --> 04:30.237
Stephanie? Miss Savage, please.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.630
- You and Luke?
- I know.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.438
Holy unholy alliances.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.512
This is why I asked Mr. Bendis
a week ago if we could be partners.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.433
- To avoid a situation like this.
- Why? Who did you get?

04:40.600 --> 04:43.398
Marcy Ross and I
are doing Cort Ás and the Aztecs.

04:43.560 --> 04:47.235
I like Marcy Ross. She's got a good smile
on her. It's innocent but it's knowing.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.437
- You're going after Marcy now too?
- Hey. I'm the victim here, okay?

04:50.600 --> 04:53.478
Don't tell me, tell Summer and Anna.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.279
And, hey, eventually you might
want to tell Marcy too.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.878
What are you and Luke doing?
That was me ignoring you, by the way.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.395
Spanish Inquisition.
Meeting at his house after school.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.028
You're going into the belly of the beast?

05:05.200 --> 05:08.749
Hey, it's not gonna be that bad. Who
knows, you might end up being friends.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.996
- You think?
- No, it's too weird.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.515
I mean, my ex-boyfriend
hanging out with my boyfriend?

05:14.680 --> 05:18.036
- What are you guys gonna talk about?
- I can only think of one thing.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.473
So I talked to my guy at the SEC
and your clients...

05:22.640 --> 05:26.918
...and they all agree that if you make
full restitution by January 1 st...

05:27.080 --> 05:30.436
- But that means selling the house.
- And avoiding criminal prosecution.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.716
- And jail time.
- I can't sell the house now...

05:32.880 --> 05:36.190
...it's almost the holidays.
I can't do that to Julie and Kaitlin.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.193
They wouldn't have to move out
right away. Just show the house...

05:39.360 --> 05:41.157
...when Julie and Kaitlin are out.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.357
What if she says no? She's on
the title too. What if she won't sell?

05:44.520 --> 05:48.718
What choice does she have? She can't
afford to live there if you're in jail.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.917
Now that she's got
Caleb Nichol in her pocket...

05:52.080 --> 05:55.072
- You had lunch with him?
- No.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.755
I had lunch with Ryan.
Seth was just, you know, there.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.595
I cannot believe you.
Coop, where is your loyalty?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.352
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.239
- I'm not getting involved.
- That means he said something.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.995
- What did he say?
- Nothing. I told you.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.388
Hey.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.233
Hello. What did he say?

06:15.400 --> 06:18.631
- What did who say?
- Seth.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.473
Oh, it's you.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.472
You're, like, flossing.
At school.

06:31.240 --> 06:35.279
Do you have any idea how much bacteria
accumulates between lunch and dinner?

06:35.440 --> 06:38.671
No. But the fact that you do
tells me everything.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.397
Look, if you want him,
you can have him. I'm done.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.433
Thanks. But that's okay.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.068
Right. Because you couldn't
be interested in someone...

06:49.240 --> 06:51.435
...that's interested in me.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.717
No. Because I couldn't possibly
be interested in someone...

06:54.880 --> 06:57.348
...who treats women that way.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.633
So how much bacteria? Like, a lot?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.512
A lot.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.469
Thanks.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.474
Hey, I was hoping I'd bump into you.
I wanted to...

07:18.640 --> 07:19.834
Hi, Summer.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.795
And Anna hanging out together.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.590
That's... That's awkward.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.194
- Not really.
- Well, I meant for me.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.830
How are you guys?
You guys good? You guys getting along?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.879
Yes. In fact, we were just about
to go to the library...

07:38.040 --> 07:39.712
...to do some research.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.279
We were?

07:41.440 --> 07:43.271
Yeah. The library.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.756
- For books.
- Books.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.310
Yeah. And then we thought we'd go
shopping, right? South Coast Plaza?

07:49.480 --> 07:51.391
- Sounds good. Okay.
- All right.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.152
Okay.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.470
That doesn't sound good at all.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.919
- Hey, guys.
- Kirsten. You made it.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.036
How are you feeling, sweetie?

08:09.200 --> 08:12.510
Julie told us you were
"under the weather" at Thanksgiving.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.878
- She did?
- Oh, well, the holidays can be so stressful.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.589
I could go for a little hair of the dog
myself right about now.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.671
We'll see you out there.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.308
- Hey, wait up, guys.
- Julie.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.835
Kirsten, you showed up.
How are you feeling?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.753
So did you tell everyone
I was drunk at Thanksgiving?

08:30.920 --> 08:33.115
Everyone was wondering
where you were, so...

08:33.280 --> 08:35.270
I was at the office working.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.431
Well, hey, it's okay.
We're all friends here.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.592
If we're all friends,
why don't you start acting like one?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.996
- Hi. Ryan, isn't it?
- Hi.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.037
Luke will be right down. Come in.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.668
- No! Mine!
- Give me! Give it!

08:54.840 --> 08:56.159
- Stop! The head!
- Just give...

08:56.320 --> 08:59.153
- Stop it.
- Guys, guys. This is Luke's friend Ryan.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.151
Ryan, this is Eric and Brad.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.799
- Give it now.
- Stop.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.473
- Who wants a snack?
- Me.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.358
Ryan?

09:06.520 --> 09:08.829
- Hello.
- Daddy, you're home.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.512
- There they are. How are you doing?
- Can we play some ball later?

09:12.680 --> 09:15.831
You know what, kids,
I'm just home to drop off Mom's car.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.198
One of the belts was misaligned. I had
them change the oil too. Sorry, fellas.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.151
You remember Luke's friend Ryan.
They're doing a project together.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.914
- Yeah? What about?
- Spanish Inquisition.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.389
Not one of Western civilization's
proudest moments.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.235
I was a history major at USC.
Now I sell cars for a living.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.789
Don't listen to him, Ryan.
He owns three dealerships.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.316
- God, Mom. Brag much?
- She's just being proud of me.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.436
Let's just do this.
We got a lot of work.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.034
Yeah, me too. Gus is outside.
I'll see you tonight.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.350
Ryan, keep him on his toes, please.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.351
Luke, SC-Notre Dame this Saturday.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.795
Thought we'd drive up about noon.
Tailgate.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.154
Yeah, cool.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.198
Ryan, it's gonna be a good game.
You're more than welcome.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.955
- Come on, give it back. It's not yours!
- Guys!

10:03.360 --> 10:05.749
So how you wanna do this?

10:06.920 --> 10:08.239
I don't know. I was thinking...

10:08.400 --> 10:11.551
Because I got books from the library,
I pulled some stuff off the Web.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.792
I was thinking we could do, like,
a screen show on my PowerBook.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.793
My dad's got a scanner at the office,
color LaserJet, PowerPoint.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.872
We could just pull some stuff here
and then head over there.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.279
You know, or not.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.430
No, no. That sounds good.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.509
Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.072
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. It's me. Can you talk?

10:37.240 --> 10:40.357
Yeah. I'm just packing
some of Marissa's winter things.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.636
I'll drop them by in the morning,
if that's okay.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.836
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.430
- What's going on, Jimmy?
- <i>Look, l</i>... <i>I had a meeting with Sandy.</i>

10:49.600 --> 10:53.991
And it looks like I have to pay
everything back by January 1 st.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.436
- Jimmy, it's the holidays.
- I don't have any other choice.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.194
What are Kaitlin and I supposed to do?
Where will we live?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.635
Live with your mother or... Caleb's.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.198
No, we can't. And we shouldn't have to.
This is my house too. And Kaitlin's.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.352
- <i>And we're not selling.</i>
- Julie, I could go to jail.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.196
Maybe you should, Jimmy.
Have you ever thought about that?

11:16.480 --> 11:19.392
<i>Maybe you deserve to go to jail.</i>

11:22.920 --> 11:24.751
Dad?

11:26.440 --> 11:27.998
Hello?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.991
Dad, you here?

11:31.040 --> 11:33.600
I don't know. He must've gone home.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.233
Nice, huh? They're giving these away.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.874
Oh, nice. It's in.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.873
Check it out:
450 horsepower, 8-cylinder.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.114
Dude, you have to get in.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.713
Wow, man.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.269
The stereo's insane.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.552
Is that your dad?

12:14.840 --> 12:16.876
Yeah, and that's
his business partner, Gus.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.871
We should go say hey.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.231
- Lf you tell anyone...
- I won't.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.914
- Go! Let's go!
- Luke?

13:09.320 --> 13:10.992
Luke!

13:18.560 --> 13:21.870
Sorry I'm late.
I slept through my alarm.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.712
No, it's okay.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.918
How'd it go last night?
You didn't call me, so...

13:29.080 --> 13:32.834
- We were working pretty late.
- Did you meet his mom? She's really great.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.912
- Seemed nice, yeah.
- And I'm sure his dad was out of town?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.789
- No, he was there.
- Really? Because he's never around.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.669
He's got these dealerships in other cities,
and he's always traveling.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.234
What?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.789
Nothing. Just...

13:49.360 --> 13:51.271
- I need some coffee.
- Okay.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.034
I knew you guys would talk.
So, what did he say about me?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.079
Nothing.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.957
Fine. I'll go grab Seth.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.473
Wait.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.189
Something happened last night.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.314
But I told Luke I wouldn't say anything.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.914
Is it...? Is he okay?

14:13.320 --> 14:14.639
What is it?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.836
Ryan, you can tell me.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.389
You can't tell anyone,
not even Summer.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.835
- Especially Summer.
- I won't. I swear.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.276
- Because I'm not even telling Seth.
- You can trust me.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.318
I won't say a word. I promise.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.037
Well, apparently some of us
are on Central time.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.918
Yeah, sorry.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.917
So how was your date with Luke,
your new study buddy?

14:42.080 --> 14:46.073
- It was fine. Something for the road?
- Yes, I'd like something. It's called gossip.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.038
Was there any cross-burning?
Any goose-stepping?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.031
Small Taiwanese family
locked in the basement?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.760
- Not so much. Fruit? Bagel?
- Yeah, a bagel would be good.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.831
Yes. So would some information.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.754
You went behind enemy lines. Come on,
the parents. What's the deal? Cyborgs?

14:59.920 --> 15:01.433
Supremacists? Vegans?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.670
We went to his dad's dealership,
looked at cars.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.955
You guys friends now?

15:14.720 --> 15:16.836
First Summer and Anna.
Now you and Luke.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.556
They came out
of the bathroom together.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.871
Then they went off
to the library together. Together.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.917
Stranger things have happened.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.914
Two people who hate each other,
brought together by their hatred of me.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.629
It's like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader
teaming up to destroy the Emperor.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.956
- Hey, we should talk about...
- We got nothing to talk about.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.475
- Our presentation?
- I'll finish it myself.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.914
All right.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.391
- What are you looking at, queer?
- Somebody writing you new material?

15:47.560 --> 15:50.279
All right, go with what works.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.435
I... I gotta get to Spanish.

15:54.720 --> 15:59.111
So I guess this means you and Luke are
not friends, which I find oddly comforting.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.152
I promise.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.035
So, hey.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.189
That's a big test.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.517
You know what?

16:31.680 --> 16:32.829
Don't.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.239
Hey, wanna...? Over there?

16:46.400 --> 16:47.549
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.756
- Is this seat taken?
- It is now.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.353
Cool.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.193
- So did you study for the bio thing?
- Kind of.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.509
Well, I didn't.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.511
Don't worry. All you have to remember is:

16:57.680 --> 17:00.319
Kittens prefer cream or fish,
generally speaking.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.799
Excuse me?

17:01.960 --> 17:05.474
Kingdom. Phylum. Class. Order.
Family. Genus. Species.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.358
- You're, like, really smart.
- Compared to what?

17:09.440 --> 17:10.667
Well, me.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.309
- Summer, you're smart.
- Well, smart enough to sit next to you.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.198
What was that kitten thing again?

17:17.359 --> 17:19.669
Kittens prefer cream or fish,
generally speaking.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.637
Or, if you're not a cat person:

17:21.800 --> 17:23.950
King Philip comes over for good sex.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.634
- Definitely not a cat person.
- Right.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.597
That's really good. Thanks.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.669
I am so sore. Are you?

17:42.880 --> 17:46.395
I'm fine. You must not
have stretched properly.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.558
Are you okay?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.469
Sandy told me about the house.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.791
Nothing to tell. I'm not selling.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.518
Julie...

18:03.200 --> 18:04.633
Julie.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.876
If you and Kaitlin
need somewhere to live...

18:08.040 --> 18:09.758
...I can find you a house.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.797
My dad can find you a house.

18:11.960 --> 18:15.555
Not according to him. Not without
compromising our relationship.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.914
He said that?

18:17.080 --> 18:20.959
So I told him if that's true, we don't have
to have a relationship. So now we don't.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.350
I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.671
Wow. You'd think you'd be celebrating.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.400
Go ahead. Tell everybody
that Caleb Nichol dumped me...

18:29.560 --> 18:32.393
...my husband's going to jail,
and I have no place to live.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.155
What you waiting for? I told them about
Thanksgiving. Now you can get even.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.878
If you need anything, let me know.

18:39.360 --> 18:44.309
Oh, my God! You guys, I just ran
into Betsy on the elliptical trainer.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.358
She was getting her car
serviced this morning.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.839
Okay, come here.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.315
Okay, you can't tell anyone...

18:52.480 --> 18:56.792
...but you are not going
to believe this. Okay...

18:57.760 --> 19:00.797
I've never seen you hit the ball
like that, Jimmy. You crushed it.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.594
Creative visualization.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.228
- Julie's head.
- Get a realtor, show the house.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.796
- But she...
- Julie will change her tune.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.352
Once word spreads that the SEC
is investigating her...

19:12.520 --> 19:15.557
...as a possible co-conspirator,
forget about it.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.153
They are?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.038
I can make a call.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.439
Thank you.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.516
- I'll get this one.
- Thanks.

19:26.680 --> 19:30.559
You know, I gotta say,
you've just been incredibly...

19:30.720 --> 19:32.756
...cool with me. I...

19:32.920 --> 19:34.717
You know, considering...

19:34.880 --> 19:36.029
...everything.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.916
You know, I really appreciate, you know,
you just not saying anything...

19:40.080 --> 19:43.197
...and I know you only heard it
from Kirsten's point of view...

19:43.360 --> 19:45.237
...but I want you to hear it from me.

19:46.520 --> 19:50.638
That whole thing was just a huge mistake.
I'm really sorry.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.268
Jimmy, what the hell
are you talking about?

19:53.440 --> 19:56.637
- Kirsten didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

20:05.240 --> 20:08.312
You know, when Julie kicked me out...

20:08.880 --> 20:11.678
...I was lost, and Kirsten...

20:11.840 --> 20:14.593
...came over to help me
set up my place.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.713
And...

20:19.360 --> 20:20.475
...I...

20:22.800 --> 20:24.313
...kissed her.

20:24.480 --> 20:29.759
Now, she was totally mortified. I...
And I apologized immediately.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.952
She left, like...

20:32.120 --> 20:33.519
...faster than that. I mean...

20:33.680 --> 20:37.229
And she didn't tell you, because she
didn't... She didn't want to hurt you.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.278
It meant nothing. So she didn't
want to hurt you over...

20:40.440 --> 20:42.078
Over nothing.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.597
Which now...

20:45.960 --> 20:47.712
...I've done.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.678
Creative visualization, Jimmy.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.513
I'm trying hard not to see your head
as something I should hit.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.352
Look, I'm really sorry.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.274
I, you know... I just didn't want there
to be any secrets between us.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.917
Mission accomplished.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.477
- Hey.
- I've some news, but I'm only telling you.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.877
Oh, my God.
Coop, you are not going to believe this.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.429
Did you hear about Luke's dad?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.519
I haven't heard about Luke's dad.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.074
- Hey, I have crazy news for you.
- It's about your woman problems.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.798
No, it's definitely not.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.349
I heard his dad's favorite show
is <i>Dawson 's Crack.</i>

21:34.520 --> 21:36.954
I heard it was <i>Ever-woody.</i>

21:37.120 --> 21:38.553
Wait, Ryan.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.909
- Hey, man, look...
- Who'd you tell?

21:42.080 --> 21:44.036
Listen, I'm sorry.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.273
You're dead.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.789
- Everyone knows.
- Yeah, well, who'd you tell?

21:58.960 --> 22:00.678
What? I didn't tell any...

22:00.840 --> 22:03.991
- Was it Summer? I asked you not to...
- Why do you just assume it was me?

22:04.160 --> 22:07.357
Because I'm the only one who knew,
and you're the only one I told.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.233
I didn't tell anyone.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.789
I never should've told you
in the first place.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.430
Probably not, since obviously
you don't trust me.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.393
You know what,
find your own ride home.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.752
Hey.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.319
Hey.

22:45.480 --> 22:50.270
It's amazing about the Wards.
How fast word travels.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.237
Sometimes.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.390
- I'd ask you if everything's okay...
- It's not.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.677
Which leads me to my next question.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.071
It's well-covered territory with us.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.911
Jimmy Cooper.

23:06.800 --> 23:11.510
I... I want to do my best
not to sound too...

23:11.840 --> 23:14.912
...high-school, but...

23:17.600 --> 23:19.352
He kissed you.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.759
He told you?

23:21.920 --> 23:24.992
He didn't want there to be any secrets
between us. Apparently...

23:25.160 --> 23:27.469
...you don't feel the same way.
- Of course I do.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.392
It's just that it meant nothing.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.030
Putting my own skepticism about
that remark aside for just a moment...

23:35.200 --> 23:36.838
...if it meant nothing...

23:37.880 --> 23:40.075
...then why didn't you tell me?

23:42.040 --> 23:44.508
- Because I knew it would upset you.
- Thank you.

23:44.680 --> 23:48.195
Because I feel much so better
having heard it from someone else.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.878
- I'm sorry.
- All this time...

23:51.040 --> 23:55.352
...this suspicion and paranoia
about me and my co-worker...

23:55.520 --> 23:58.159
...and you're sitting on this.
- Sandy...

23:58.320 --> 23:59.878
Sandy...

24:04.080 --> 24:06.674
It means nothing.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.998
It means something to me.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.316
Okay, it's just that, after all
the years of Luke calling me gay...

24:25.000 --> 24:27.036
...it's great that the shoe's on the other...

24:27.200 --> 24:29.839
Actually, it's on his dad's foot,
but you get the symmetry.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.718
It's not funny.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.792
It's the end of their marriage.
The life they knew is over.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.793
- I heard Meredith's filing for divorce.
- I was over there.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.269
- They seemed really happy.
- Yeah?

24:40.440 --> 24:42.715
By "happy," do you mean gay?

24:42.880 --> 24:44.677
Seth, cut it out.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.389
I mean, how can you be married for
that long and keep that kind of a secret?

24:48.560 --> 24:49.993
You'd be surprised.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.752
But eventually the secrets come out.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.636
And some marriages can handle
the truth, and some can't.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.753
Yeah, well, I'm sure everyone
will be so accepting...

25:02.920 --> 25:05.798
...seeing as we're
such a liberal, tolerant bunch.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.599
That was at the expense
of Orange County, not Luke's dad.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.830
His big gay dad.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.639
Did you see his arms?
What straight guy has arms like that?

25:13.800 --> 25:14.915
Not my husband.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.153
Charles and I went to see <i>The Lion King</i>
with the Wards, and Carson cried.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.753
Wept.

25:23.400 --> 25:27.075
All these years I've known him,
he's never once made a pass at me.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.629
I feel so much better.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.073
- I can't be here right now.
- Have you eaten?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.992
- What do you have in mind?
- Fried food and beer.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.798
First round's on me.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.516
All right, if everyone will take
his or her seat, we shall begin.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.148
Anyone seen Luke?

25:54.360 --> 25:56.828
Okay, let's open our books to page 59...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.958
...the Chesapeake
and the West Indian colonies.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.471
So you should come over, like, at 4.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.757
Yeah. I've got lit mag after school,
but I can come by after that.

26:06.920 --> 26:09.480
Okay, yeah, the flash cards
should be done by then.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.348
Hi, you guys.
Can I speak to you for one minute, please?

26:13.520 --> 26:16.478
Because I owe you both
an enormous apology.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.516
I guess, technically,
I owe two apologies...

26:19.680 --> 26:23.389
...each one tailored to the specific wrongs
visited upon the specific person.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.676
But since you two seem to be
a package deal...

26:25.840 --> 26:29.355
- Cohen!
- Right. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.479
And I'm also sorry that I apologized
to her first. It's just, chronologically, l...

26:33.640 --> 26:35.039
- Cohen.
- Right. Stupid, I know.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.873
Well, let me start by saying
nothing in my life...

26:38.040 --> 26:42.431
...nothing, prepared me for the events
of that fateful Thanksgiving day.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.478
But I'm not gonna make
any excuses for what I did.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.674
I just wanna say one thing
in my defense, which is:

26:48.840 --> 26:52.355
You can't really blame me for wanting
the company of either of you two.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.352
And I know that I hurt your feelings
and I feel bad about that.

26:56.520 --> 27:00.798
I do, but please believe me when I say
that it wasn't intentional, okay?

27:00.960 --> 27:03.190
I would never do anything
to ruin our friendship...

27:03.360 --> 27:05.874
...or "-ships."

27:07.720 --> 27:09.312
I know I have no right to ask...

27:09.480 --> 27:12.392
...I just hope that some day
you can both forgive me.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.677
Okay. So, yeah, thanks for your time.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.712
You know, I never liked flash cards.
They never worked for me.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.110
Yeah, you know,
I think I study better alone.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.953
That's good, because I think
lit mag is going to go late.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.031
- Maybe next test?
- Maybe.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.596
It's like they enjoy it.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.796
Well, I can't exactly claim that I didn't
once see the fun in witnessing...

27:41.960 --> 27:44.633
...the fall of the rich and fabulous.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.031
Then I became homeless,
and suddenly not so funny.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.873
I don't really think that my dad
would let you go homeless.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.792
Yeah, well, when I even mentioned...

27:52.960 --> 27:55.633
...that I might have to sell
the house, he went into a panic.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.831
You'd have thought
I was asking for a ring.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.036
- That's so him.
- And when I tried to explain...

28:00.200 --> 28:01.758
- He didn't listen.
- Not a word.

28:01.920 --> 28:05.230
Can I ask you a question?
Do you like that he calls you Kiki?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.231
- Hate it.
- He kept calling me Juju...

28:07.400 --> 28:10.278
...like that candy that gets in your teeth.
I begged him to stop.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.000
- When he gets something in his head...
- It has to be his way.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.593
Always.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.992
It's just who he is.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.156
He can't spend longer than three months
with the same woman before he freaks.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.719
He freaked, all right.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.348
And I wish I could tell him
that I know what he's doing.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.080
He's trying to replace my mom.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.071
But he can't.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.472
And I just wish that he would
stop trying and be happy.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.359
- But you can't talk to my dad.
- No, I know.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.791
And the important thing is that he finds
someone to share his life with.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.155
Enjoy these years.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.032
I just don't know
if he's ever gonna figure that out.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.676
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.430
So that apology...

29:08.600 --> 29:11.876
...aside from being the first
I've ever received from a boy...

29:12.040 --> 29:14.679
...was also the nicest.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.956
Well. Well...

29:17.120 --> 29:18.997
...I meant it, so, good.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.712
So, what are you doing Saturday?

29:32.920 --> 29:35.195
- Hey, Seth.
- Hey.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.396
- You going to lit mag?
- Yeah.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.516
Wanna walk together?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.236
- Do you?
- Yes.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.231
That was so sweet,
what you said earlier.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.231
And I could tell you really meant it.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.197
We know sincerity
isn't your strong point.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.511
- I'm working on it.
- I'd like to help.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.833
What are you doing Saturday night?

29:58.760 --> 30:01.797
Well, in the new spirit of sincerity...

30:03.400 --> 30:05.072
...I have a date with Summer.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.832
Yeah, so...

30:10.040 --> 30:11.632
What are you doing Friday night?

30:16.320 --> 30:18.709
What am I doing Friday night?

30:22.600 --> 30:25.672
- Hi. Why are you here?
- Same reason you are.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.592
- Hey.
- You okay, man?

30:44.200 --> 30:45.952
Look, man...

30:46.840 --> 30:48.751
I owe you an apology.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.319
It wasn't you who said anything.

30:50.480 --> 30:56.191
My dad, after we saw him,
he came out to my mom.

30:56.360 --> 31:02.117
She wigged and called a couple friends,
and then everybody in Newport knew.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.157
Don't worry about it. I just...

31:04.320 --> 31:06.709
...wanted to see how you were doing.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.432
Hey, Mom.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.913
Meredith, please.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.270
Luke, could I...?

31:18.440 --> 31:19.759
Luke, please.

31:25.960 --> 31:29.509
My entire life has been one giant lie.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.153
Everything I thought
I knew about my dad.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.913
I mean, all those business trips he took.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.748
Or how about when he missed one of my
games because he was working late.

31:45.760 --> 31:49.912
I don't even know if this guy was
the first one or if there were others.

31:51.240 --> 31:55.074
- I can't even think about it.
- Look, I know it's hard.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.758
But after everything I've been through
with my dad, we've never been closer.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.435
I mean, we're finally able to be honest
with each other and talk to each other.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.591
Maybe you could have that
with your dad.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.638
What he has to say, I don't wanna hear.

32:13.040 --> 32:16.350
I'm gonna go grab a jacket. It's cold.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.834
Well, even if he...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.560
...wasn't honest with you...

32:24.720 --> 32:25.789
...he still cared.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.037
He did make it
to some of your games.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.315
Whatever.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.311
What does it even matter?

32:31.880 --> 32:33.836
It matters.

32:34.920 --> 32:38.037
Especially if you had a dad who didn't
make it to any of your games.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.034
Who didn't even know
what sport you played or cared.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.358
Everything is just so screwed up.

32:53.920 --> 32:58.232
Isn't this romantic?
A couple of Harbor Butt Pirates.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.478
Is there a problem?

33:00.640 --> 33:02.995
Other than the fact
that we kick your ass every year?

33:03.160 --> 33:05.628
No, dude. No problem at all.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.392
Didn't mean to interrupt your date.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.231
Fag.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.630
What did you call me?

33:17.600 --> 33:19.556
Yo, dude, save that for your boyfriend.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.076
- Okay, let's just not do this.
- How about a black eye for the queer guy?

33:23.240 --> 33:25.549
Why don't you just run to your daddy.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.393
Julie, hi.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.915
I just had to come over
and say thank you.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.399
- For what?
- I got home today.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.632
There was a message on my machine,
"It's Caleb, call me." Whatever.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.950
- Well...
- I know. But I call him, right?

33:51.120 --> 33:54.590
Just in case he's ready to apologize,
which, P.S., he's not.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.672
So he starts again with the excuses,
and he's feeling pressured.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.910
- Well, because it's all about him.
- Exactly.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.311
But then I remembered what you said
at lunch, so I let him have it.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.755
- You did?
- I told him he's scared. Life's too short.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.797
- Spend it with someone you enjoy.
- You did?

34:08.960 --> 34:11.428
Don't worry, he doesn't think
it came from you.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.478
But the important thing is, it worked.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.275
- How so?
- Kirsten...

34:17.440 --> 34:20.431
...he's buying my house
as an investment.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.319
Jimmy's not going to jail.
Kaitlin and I have a place to live.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.914
And who knows...

34:25.080 --> 34:28.277
...maybe some day your
next-door neighbor will be your dad.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.956
I don't know what to say.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.192
Well, you might want to water that.
Bye.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.829
<i>Here, you look like a strong, healthy boy.</i>

34:51.000 --> 34:52.274
<i>Give me a hand.</i>

34:54.920 --> 34:56.751
Hey, Seth.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.150
Ask your mother who was at the door.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.269
Mom, who was at the door?

35:04.440 --> 35:07.796
- Julie Cooper, bearing gifts.
- Julie Cooper, Dad.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.836
Ask your mother what she wanted.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.952
Dad wants to know who...
What she wanted.

35:16.120 --> 35:19.476
Dad, better idea, ask her yourself.
Come on.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.949
Julie Cooper sold her house.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.951
To my father.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.190
Now that I wish you hadn't told me.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.555
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.479
Are you guys okay?

35:34.640 --> 35:37.791
- I didn't do it this time.
- I'm gonna get the first-aid kit.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.359
Come on, have a seat.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.556
Hey, what happened?

35:43.640 --> 35:45.392
I guess bad news travels fast.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.198
- Have you called your folks?
- No.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.272
- I'll call them.
- No. I'd rather not call them, if it's okay.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.750
- All right. He can stay in the guest room.
- Sure.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.319
- I'm gonna call his dad.
- Okay.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.635
So do you guys need
a ride to school in the morning?

36:11.800 --> 36:13.199
You don't mind?

36:13.360 --> 36:15.920
Yeah, well, you were pretty great
with Luke today.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.277
- I never should've told you.
- Because I'll tell everyone, right?

36:19.440 --> 36:22.876
- No, because he asked me not to.
- But the unwritten rule of relationships...

36:23.040 --> 36:25.235
...says you're allowed
to tell your girlfriend.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.234
Because everything you say to me
stays with me, and vice versa.

36:29.400 --> 36:33.109
So you didn't tell anybody I went off on
you yesterday when I thought you'd told?

36:33.280 --> 36:36.272
No. Well, I mean, just Summer.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.116
Will you tell Summer about this?

36:43.720 --> 36:46.632
No, this will stay just between us.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.953
Carson, are you sure
I can't get you anything to eat?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.111
Some Scotch? Xanax?

37:05.280 --> 37:07.316
No, thank you.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.550
- He's not coming down.
- Well, he's half-asleep.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.915
Maybe it'd be better
to talk in the morning.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.959
He's not gonna want to talk to me.
I lied to him.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.351
I lied to everyone. I...

37:20.560 --> 37:23.552
The truth is, I love his mom.
I always have.

37:23.720 --> 37:28.748
And I love our family.
And I just didn't want to hurt anybody.

37:29.240 --> 37:33.074
- And now he's up there hurting.
- Hey, if there's anything we can do...

37:33.240 --> 37:36.118
No. No, I've embarrassed
my family enough.

37:36.280 --> 37:38.840
I think the best thing
I could do now is to disappear.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.197
No, I think that'd be the worst
thing you could do. I mean...

37:42.360 --> 37:44.316
...it's what you've been doing all along.

37:44.480 --> 37:48.393
But coming out and being honest with
yourself and your family, in this town...

37:48.560 --> 37:50.516
...it's the bravest thing
you could've done.

37:50.680 --> 37:53.114
Look, it's just my opinion...

37:53.280 --> 37:56.352
...but you're the kind of father
any kid would be proud of.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.755
Well, I should go.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.672
Dad.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.397
Just let me grab my shoes.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.149
I'll go with you.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.078
So while we're being honest...

38:39.240 --> 38:40.912
Oh, God.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.832
There's more?

38:43.080 --> 38:45.548
That was a pretty impressive speech
you made in there.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.472
Well, I'm prone to impressive speeches.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.676
Right up until that line, yeah.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.471
- From now on, you'll tell all your secrets?
- You gonna tell me all yours?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.596
- You know, I don't think I have any.
- Really?

38:56.760 --> 38:57.954
- Yeah.
- You sure?

38:58.120 --> 39:00.270
- I think.
- Nothing from your past?

39:00.440 --> 39:02.431
No secret fantasies?

39:02.600 --> 39:05.512
No hidden porn stash on the PC?

39:05.680 --> 39:08.114
No, because obviously you
already know about that one.

39:13.080 --> 39:18.359
There's no way you can know
everything about someone.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.832
- That's what keeps it interesting.
- Well, it hasn't been uninteresting.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.878
At a certain point,
you have to trust the other person.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.793
- That's what love is.
- Okay.

39:28.960 --> 39:33.715
So you'll have to trust that you can
tell me things that I may not wanna hear.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.275
We can handle it.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.633
Like...

39:40.320 --> 39:42.231
...Jimmy Cooper kissed me?

39:45.320 --> 39:47.117
Trust me.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.913
- This is gonna be weird.
- Yep.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.231
Everybody's gonna be
staring at me and talking.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.674
Yep.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.150
Maybe I can just blow
the whole thing off...

40:23.320 --> 40:26.517
...go hit the beach, give everybody time
to get it out of their systems.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.036
It doesn't work like that. It's been
months. I'm still the kid from Chino...

40:30.200 --> 40:31.428
...that burned a house down.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.512
And I'm still the girl
who tried to kill herself in Mexico.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.750
And I'm still the...

40:36.920 --> 40:38.319
I'm still Seth Cohen.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.592
Man, this is gonna suck.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.752
Yep. Well, welcome to my world.
