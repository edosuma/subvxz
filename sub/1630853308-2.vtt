WEBVTT

00:20.395 --> 00:21.647
Where's my mom?

00:22.397 --> 00:24.691
Not here. You told me
we weren't inviting her tonight.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.778
I have to call her.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.988
Wait, wait. You didn't hit up Jewel?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.198
Where's all the shit?

00:33.450 --> 00:36.745
The cheese, the beer. Kirby, I don't know.
We made a whole list.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.539
Fuck, they're here.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.165
Who is?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.793
All right. We have tonic.
I'll call Giordano's.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.128
I'll call them. You grab that.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.636
Hey, hello. I wanna place-- Yeah. Okay.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.850
-Lakshmi Awad?
-Are we announcing arrivals now?

01:00.477 --> 01:02.604
-Hey, hold the door.
-Hey, Kirby.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.899
Hey.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.568
Where is the birthday boy?

01:07.651 --> 01:10.362
Hey. You steal that off Ben's desk?

01:10.445 --> 01:12.656
Barely cracked open.
Still counts as a gift.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.993
So, who else is coming tonight?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.286
From the office?

01:17.369 --> 01:19.955
I'm guessing Jules. Miles is on deadline.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.082
He'll bail the first chance he gets.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.960
Abby wants us to wind down
on our flood story.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.671
She killed my follow-up piece
on padded claims.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.884
What's going on? You and Marcus okay?

01:34.887 --> 01:35.888
I think so.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.015
Good.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.019
Want me to grab some photos tonight?
Give him a break?

01:42.769 --> 01:43.770
Where's his camera?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.689
Just prop it open.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.993
Hi.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.081
-Oh, my God.
-Good to see you.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.417
Whoa, don't wait. Get in here.

02:05.501 --> 02:08.628
You know you want to party tonight.
You know you want to party.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.464
You're standing way too tall
for getting down.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.885
The Cubs are an institution
built on letting us down.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.178
That's what we deserve.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.681
-Jordan's not from Chicago. Is he?
-We drink to Marcus!

02:21.391 --> 02:24.228
Wait. Where's the cake?
He needs to blow out some candles.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.522
Oh, there's no cake. I'm sorry. I…

02:27.523 --> 02:30.192
-I'm sorry. I didn't have time.
-That's all right.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.860
You need to go in there.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.654
Hey.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.410
I don't know how I got here and…

02:42.538 --> 02:44.623
being married to you
just doesn't seem real.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.878
Happy birthday.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.387
Marcus.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.556
Yeah. Good to see you.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.748
Come on.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.627
Hey, Howard.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.671
You lose.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.589
I saw last night's crime stats.

04:58.924 --> 04:59.842
You okay?

04:59.925 --> 05:03.345
Yeah. First warm week of spring,
Asters bloom, people kill each other.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.974
You lose.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.058
How's your girl?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.477
The one you brought by.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.271
My source.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.315
What was your read on her?

05:15.399 --> 05:17.317
That you shouldn't have brought her
into a morgue.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.819
She was fine with it, man.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.028
Until she wasn't.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.991
Did her wounds match Julia Madrigal's?

05:24.074 --> 05:26.660
That's hard to say.
Her scars are pretty old.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.124
Can I check out Julia's autopsy report?

05:32.207 --> 05:34.877
No. Police made their arrest.
They'd have to release it.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.589
Was anything left inside of her?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.633
Mud, debris.
I mean, she was pretty far down that pipe.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.510
Nothing else?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.681
Like what?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.686
Okay.

05:52.769 --> 05:57.024
Her father gave me this for reference.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.485
Did her dad come in to identify her?

06:00.569 --> 06:03.572
No, he wasn't up to it. He sent a cousin.

06:10.245 --> 06:13.040
-Was she killed at the site?
-No, she's a body dump.

06:13.123 --> 06:18.545
See? Some broken blood vessels
under the armpits, so he dragged her far.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.255
You think she was still alive?

06:20.339 --> 06:22.216
Well, it's a C3 fracture

06:22.299 --> 06:24.259
but she couldn't do much more
than breathe by then,

06:24.343 --> 06:26.011
even after he opened her up.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.971
See? Ribs intact.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.307
I swept inside the cavity.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.642
There's nothing there.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.145
So, you can let your source know
you followed up.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.023
Thanks, Howard.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.659
What's this?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.870
It's just debris from the site.
We found a lot of it down in that pipe.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.626
Radium ore, Midway Chemical Company.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.587
Radium's been off the market
since the '50s, okay?

07:00.671 --> 07:03.298
So that has been down there
a lot longer than she has.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.468
Where is that…

07:11.765 --> 07:13.934
-Can I?
-Yeah, not for publication.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.984
Howard…

07:26.947 --> 07:28.073
Can you bring her out?

07:29.408 --> 07:30.784
You up for it?

07:32.077 --> 07:32.995
Yeah.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.538
Okay.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.206
I know you're a delicate soul.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.805
Okay.

07:53.765 --> 07:54.808
So,

07:55.642 --> 07:59.062
we got three cracked ribs
from external trauma.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.107
There's tissue piling up her back
from being dragged.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.651
Hey, come on.
This is what you asked me for.

08:07.613 --> 08:08.947
Look again.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.454
The radium…

08:17.289 --> 08:18.624
It was inside of her.

09:39.413 --> 09:43.834
It wasn't until Cantigny
that I heard a horse scream.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.172
When the gas moved in.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.590
No.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.425
The dogs would bark first.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.095
-That's right.
-Yeah.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.471
Yeah. They could smell it.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.931
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.225
Then it would hit the horses.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.978
Then the rest of us.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.231
Yeah. That's right. That's right.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.157
I'll stop if I've told you this before.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.618
Well, we have to stop now anyway.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.830
She's just coming in now, so…

10:23.415 --> 10:24.708
I have to go.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.127
But, hey, you tell me.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.212
What do you think?

10:30.005 --> 10:31.006
How do I look?

10:31.924 --> 10:33.133
You're here to see Julia?

10:33.634 --> 10:36.428
-Yeah.
-Is she your girl?

10:37.012 --> 10:38.597
Well, no. She's not mine.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.016
Not this time.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.855
I'll see you, Leo.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.577
Hi.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.995
-Here you go.
-Thanks, sweetie.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.497
You're welcome.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.596
You need the pen?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.182
No, I just went out to grab these.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.185
You can take one if you want.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.271
I'm okay, thanks.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.941
You visiting someone you served with?

11:33.652 --> 11:36.071
-Why'd you say that?
-Your gig line.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.408
It takes training for a man
to match his buttons to his buckle.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.492
Right.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.411
I see.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.248
You shouldn't wear your hair
like that. Not at work.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.332
No-- Don't touch me.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.668
Hey, Julia.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.630
-You're half an hour early.
-My last client didn't show.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.134
-How's your week been, Gordie?
-Better now that you're here.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.928
-Yeah. That's sweet.
-I got two good ones for you.

12:00.012 --> 12:00.971
Yeah.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.665
You have no new messages.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.667
Hey. Dad?

12:31.168 --> 12:32.336
Back this way.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.716
Sorry, sorry. I was with a client.

12:38.217 --> 12:41.553
Regional keeps denying his benefits.
I've filed for them three times.

12:41.637 --> 12:44.223
Yeah, well, I've had to make
some executive decisions.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.141
Knives and forks.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.684
-Dishes.
-What's this one?

12:48.644 --> 12:49.728
Los Solitarios.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.772
I've played them for you before.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.066
You said you liked it.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.361
Tupperware?

12:57.444 --> 12:58.904
Maybe next to the sink.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.921
Where is this?

13:18.674 --> 13:19.675
That's Glencoe.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.678
North Shore?

13:24.054 --> 13:25.097
I never go there.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.766
Yeah, you didn't seem to be
having too good a time.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.726
What about this?

13:30.602 --> 13:31.603
On the counter's fine.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.587
Hey. I was looking
for clips on your assault.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.422
There are none.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.966
You're still working on Madrigal?

14:01.466 --> 14:02.676
For now.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.596
Okay.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.889
There won't be much to pull.

14:06.972 --> 14:10.267
We ran a blurb on it,
and there was a beat-up in the Reader.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.393
Do you have a police report?

14:11.977 --> 14:14.104
I wanted to compare it
with the Madrigal autopsy.

14:14.188 --> 14:17.274
Did you speak to the medical examiner?
What was inside of Julia?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.942
Okay…

14:20.402 --> 14:23.739
It's problematic that you work here.
I mean, that we work together.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.825
You can't be my colleague
and my source at the same time.

14:26.909 --> 14:30.787
I have to be able to ask you questions
and vet your answers. Right?

14:31.580 --> 14:32.664
To see if I'm lying?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.584
To verify what we publish.

14:38.462 --> 14:39.463
Fine.

14:40.339 --> 14:44.009
Can you tell me what you meant when
you said he left something inside you?

14:49.890 --> 14:50.891
Come on.

14:55.979 --> 14:56.980
What are we doing here?

14:58.649 --> 15:00.442
He left matches inside of me.

15:01.527 --> 15:04.988
-Matches? Like light a match, matches?
-A matchbook.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.242
From the Bee Happy bar with this address.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.916
This must have been a bar before.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.086
-It's actually a good spot for it.
-No, I checked the city records.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.339
There has never been a bar
at this address.

15:32.683 --> 15:33.976
That's what was inside of Julia.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.491
What is it?

15:53.537 --> 15:58.458
Can you… walk me through
what happened to you that day?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.377
Where were you?

16:02.713 --> 16:04.381
I was by the North Avenue Beach.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.258
You were alone?

16:07.092 --> 16:08.468
I was walking my dog.

16:10.429 --> 16:11.680
You're married to Marcus, right?

16:13.932 --> 16:15.559
Were you guys living together back then?

16:18.395 --> 16:19.688
Why does that matter?

16:21.940 --> 16:23.692
Did he usually walk the dog with you?

16:23.775 --> 16:24.776
He wasn't there.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.031
I was alone.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.909
-I was walking my dog by the beach and I--
-Hang on.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.035
Hang on, Kirby.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.287
Do you have any family?

16:35.954 --> 16:36.997
My mom.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.166
We talked about her.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.755
No, we never talked about your mom.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.133
Is she local?

16:54.389 --> 16:55.557
I think so.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.142
You don't know where your mom lives?

16:57.643 --> 16:59.978
-I did. I just-- I don't--
-But you won't tell me?

17:00.062 --> 17:03.065
-I can't.
-Listen, I'm not trying to trip you up.

17:03.148 --> 17:06.359
Kirby, these are
very basic questions that I--

17:06.443 --> 17:08.569
For you, but not for me.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.655
Not today.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.449
Okay.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.162
You don't have to have
all the answers now. It's okay.

17:17.246 --> 17:19.540
I don't need them now. Okay?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.541
I just don't want to get it wrong.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.042
Me neither.

17:28.757 --> 17:33.971
Anything you have
that can corroborate your story,

17:34.721 --> 17:35.722
that would help.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.267
Okay.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.438
Okay.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.702
Is there a cover?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.245
You can make donations inside.

17:59.454 --> 18:05.169
We will celebrate his good life

18:05.252 --> 18:10.299
We will celebrate with joy

18:10.382 --> 18:13.719
We will celebrate his life

18:13.802 --> 18:17.181
We will celebrate his joy

18:17.264 --> 18:22.227
Celebrate our Lord's good life

18:28.734 --> 18:34.072
Let us celebrate our gracious Lord

18:34.156 --> 18:39.411
Who teaches us to give him more

18:39.494 --> 18:44.875
Than we ever dreamed
that we could give before

18:46.418 --> 18:48.170
Yeah. Yes!

18:48.253 --> 18:51.089
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.759
Oh, so nice for coming down.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.094
Nice to see you. Good to see you.

18:56.762 --> 18:58.639
Barbara, good to see you.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.766
How you doing? Oh, thanks.

19:00.849 --> 19:01.892
Kirby?

19:02.726 --> 19:03.977
Everybody.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.231
This is my daughter.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.987
Hi. Hi. Hey.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.657
Hi.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.911
Mom, can we get out of here?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.037
I just came to get my stuff.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.915
I need my hospital records
and my photos, okay?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.251
Okay?

19:28.502 --> 19:32.047
Oh, Heavenly Father, thank you
for bringing my daughter back to me.

19:33.048 --> 19:37.386
Oh, Heavenly Father, we know
you have the power to transform.

19:37.469 --> 19:40.806
Heavenly Father, we know that
you are the redeemer and the healer.

19:41.431 --> 19:45.811
Oh, Heavenly Father,
we feel your spirit moving in us today.

19:45.894 --> 19:50.607
And we ask that you always,
always keep her in your sight.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.734
Amen. Praise the Lord.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.450
Here. There might be some in there.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.630
This isn't the one I need.

20:13.714 --> 20:17.509
I need photos and journals
from after the hospital.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.471
Well, I may have tossed them.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.432
I don't know. Why do you need all this?

20:25.684 --> 20:26.768
There's another woman.

20:28.437 --> 20:29.938
She's been killed,

20:30.022 --> 20:32.107
and we think it might be the same man.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.111
So we're covering her story.

20:38.197 --> 20:39.364
And you're helping?

20:45.621 --> 20:47.664
Check your old suitcase. It's in the back.

20:57.966 --> 20:58.967
Thanks.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.270
-Who's making you do this?
-No one. I want to.

21:11.855 --> 21:12.731
Why?

21:15.776 --> 21:17.611
Look, you were with me…

21:18.737 --> 21:20.948
when I opened for The Effigies.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.324
Okay, yeah.

21:31.625 --> 21:37.798
…Save me
If I give any more of my brain

21:39.341 --> 21:44.096
We've been down this before
And I don't wanna do it anymore

21:44.179 --> 21:47.432
-Why is it okay for you, you, you
-Half those people are dead now.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.518
Or in real estate.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.106
Come here, baby!

21:54.189 --> 21:56.149
It's my daughter!

21:56.233 --> 21:58.652
Oh, look what's happening now.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.782
It's so embarrassing.

22:03.866 --> 22:06.285
I thought you were great. You were great.

22:10.247 --> 22:11.748
Why don't we talk anymore?

22:12.583 --> 22:13.750
That was your call.

22:14.418 --> 22:17.963
But I told you, you're welcome to come
to services anytime you want.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.932
I've never seen any radium before.

22:29.850 --> 22:32.102
Did Julia ever talk about any friends?

22:32.978 --> 22:34.229
Boyfriends?

22:34.313 --> 22:36.481
She never even talked about herself.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.108
Her mind was always on everyone else.

22:40.152 --> 22:43.363
-I mean no ill against her.
-Of course.

22:43.447 --> 22:46.533
But her problem was she didn't know
to be scared till it was too late.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.202
Scared of who?

22:49.369 --> 22:50.412
She wouldn't say.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.206
Then how'd you know?

22:53.123 --> 22:56.335
She changed a few weeks
before she stopped coming.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.881
This was a woman
who could nut-kick a linebacker.

23:00.964 --> 23:03.050
Then suddenly I'm walking her to her car?

23:03.133 --> 23:04.343
Didn't make sense.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.179
-She thought someone was following her?
-She must have.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.681
Otherwise,
she just wanted to hold my hand?

23:10.390 --> 23:11.683
She mention calling the cops?

23:12.434 --> 23:13.435
She never said.

23:14.228 --> 23:16.438
She believed in that.
Going through the system.

23:16.522 --> 23:18.857
She got me this place.
Did all the paperwork.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.194
She was a diamond.

23:22.277 --> 23:23.654
Rarest fucking kind.

23:25.531 --> 23:26.532
Appreciate your time.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.078
I wanted to follow up on Julia Madrigal.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.039
She make any stalking complaints
before her disappearance?

23:34.122 --> 23:37.000
Didn't think you guys were interested.
Not much in your paper about her.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.586
-It was just a holding piece.
-What else are you waiting on?

23:39.670 --> 23:42.089
Did Ms. Madrigal
make any stalking complaint--

23:42.172 --> 23:43.423
I can't comment on that.

23:43.924 --> 23:45.217
What about the second victim?

23:48.554 --> 23:50.180
She claims you have the wrong suspect.

23:50.931 --> 23:52.516
I wasn't aware of any second victim.

23:53.642 --> 23:56.019
I don't know how that's possible.
She knows you.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.652
Is this who you're talking to?

24:04.236 --> 24:06.989
Sharon Leads. Is that your source?

24:07.656 --> 24:10.200
Sharon, or Kirby,
or whatever she's calling herself.

24:10.826 --> 24:14.413
You build a story off of her,
and you'll end up printing a retraction.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.918
Her wounds seem to be consistent
with Ms. Madrigal's.

24:20.419 --> 24:21.545
The ME confirmed it.

24:22.254 --> 24:26.383
That may be so, but Kirby barely had
any memory post-assault.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.596
And then a few months later,
she completely broke down.

24:30.679 --> 24:33.223
Had to be admitted to Chicago-Read
for observation.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.225
She seems pretty sure now.

24:35.309 --> 24:38.061
I brought her in to ID the suspect.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.564
She blanked on him,
but she connected to the victim.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.773
I guess she went with that.

24:43.025 --> 24:44.776
What about Ms. Madrigal's
stalking complaints?

24:44.860 --> 24:46.278
Yeah, she was being stalked.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.197
And now he's in jail for her murder.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.742
Pawel Banik was stalking her?

24:52.659 --> 24:54.953
Read up on your source
before you start speculating.

25:19.645 --> 25:22.481
Your mom called.
Said you left pretty upset.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.234
Yeah, she's a lot. What are you doing?

25:27.778 --> 25:29.446
I'm testing out some new film stock.

25:32.658 --> 25:34.076
When was I supposed to come home?

25:35.244 --> 25:36.245
A couple hours ago.

25:39.957 --> 25:40.958
You're not mad?

25:42.167 --> 25:43.293
Do you want me to be?

25:50.884 --> 25:52.427
You messed up my birthday.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.764
You went to see your mom
for the first time in months.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.850
I know something's up.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.270
Then why aren't you asking me about it?

26:01.937 --> 26:03.689
When you wanna tell me, you will.

26:04.273 --> 26:05.399
You wanna talk about it?

26:06.191 --> 26:07.192
No.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.152
Okay.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.071
Then drink your beer.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.644
You don't need that.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.105
I'm not in the house.

28:51.273 --> 28:52.399
How'd you get inside?

28:53.859 --> 28:55.402
You let me in.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.821
I don't know you.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.031
You did.

28:59.781 --> 29:00.782
You will.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.161
What are these?

29:05.287 --> 29:06.288
How did you take them?

29:06.371 --> 29:09.458
They're from tomorrow,
but you may not be there.

29:09.541 --> 29:10.584
Watch your step.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.170
When I close my eyes,

29:14.421 --> 29:15.714
the memories I have,

29:17.466 --> 29:19.259
I don't know where they're from anymore.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.137
Do you think
you can remember the future?

29:35.317 --> 29:36.318
New request.

29:40.155 --> 29:42.950
Pull everything you have on Sharon Leads.

29:44.493 --> 29:47.204
I usually like
to get my sources' names right.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.122
Call it professional pride.

29:49.665 --> 29:52.000
-I pulled your employment application.
-From here?

29:52.501 --> 29:53.836
Yeah. From here.

29:55.254 --> 29:56.880
You put down that you went to U of I?

29:56.964 --> 29:58.549
And worked at the Tribune?

29:58.632 --> 30:00.092
I didn't lie to get this job.

30:00.926 --> 30:03.053
"Sharon Leads." Is that from the police?

30:04.137 --> 30:06.265
Do you want me to walk you through
what they left out?

30:11.603 --> 30:14.982
I took these after they discharged me
from the hospital.

30:20.362 --> 30:21.947
You were in there for a bit?

30:22.030 --> 30:23.824
I thought I was paralyzed.

30:24.491 --> 30:25.868
Took a while to come back.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.121
For this kind of assault,

30:30.581 --> 30:33.792
the PD write-up is pretty light.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.169
Yeah, it would be.

30:35.252 --> 30:37.296
They took my statement
when I was on pain meds.

30:38.172 --> 30:40.340
They said they were gonna come back,
but they never did.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.681
Then tell me what I'm missing here, Kirby.

30:49.016 --> 30:51.018
Were you still living
in Wicker Park back then?

30:51.101 --> 30:52.895
Yeah, that was off of Monroe.

30:54.188 --> 30:55.689
To be closer to the Tribune?

30:56.523 --> 30:57.900
You wanted to be a reporter.

30:59.776 --> 31:00.944
Why aren't you doing that?

31:02.446 --> 31:03.822
I was out for too long.

31:04.489 --> 31:05.741
This is all I could get.

31:10.495 --> 31:13.749
And you couldn't give the police
any kind of ID? Not even a rough sketch?

31:17.294 --> 31:18.879
He came up from behind me.

31:20.714 --> 31:24.092
But I don't know how no one else saw him.

31:27.346 --> 31:28.597
There were so many people.

31:32.851 --> 31:35.354
That's not in here.
There's no witnesses listed.

31:36.355 --> 31:37.356
I know.

31:41.610 --> 31:45.656
There were so many people,
and then there just weren't.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.408
And I was alone.

31:54.873 --> 31:58.293
Before it happened, did you have
any break-ins? Any wrong numbers?

32:01.797 --> 32:02.798
No.

32:05.759 --> 32:09.012
But I knew something was… off.

32:11.306 --> 32:14.601
I would come home,
and it was like someone had just left.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.109
Julia was being stalked.

32:23.402 --> 32:26.530
She filed reports.
She said he had been in her house.

32:29.783 --> 32:31.285
You think he was watching me?

32:43.797 --> 32:44.798
Hey.

32:49.928 --> 32:53.182
Is there anything else
you need to tell me?

32:59.855 --> 33:03.442
I don't want anyone else in the office
to know that I'm your source.

33:05.861 --> 33:06.904
Okay.

33:08.614 --> 33:09.615
I understand.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.373
Does Julia's dad know we're coming?

33:18.457 --> 33:21.126
Yeah. The service
should have finished about an hour ago.

33:34.181 --> 33:35.182
You got kids?

33:35.724 --> 33:37.768
-Just one.
-That's enough.

33:39.353 --> 33:41.021
-How old?
-Twelve.

33:42.773 --> 33:44.900
He's really got his shit together, my kid.

33:46.652 --> 33:47.819
Much more than I do.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.072
You'll get there.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.283
You and Marcus thinking about it?

33:55.369 --> 33:59.831
We haven't really talked about kids.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.002
So, he's shot for you before?

34:04.586 --> 34:05.629
What do you think?

34:07.089 --> 34:08.090
About your husband?

34:10.759 --> 34:12.886
You haven't formed your own opinion
on the guy yet?

34:15.304 --> 34:16.389
I think he's kind.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.350
That's not my read.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.395
He's a martyr.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.522
All decency but no compassion.

34:25.315 --> 34:26.440
Well, you're not married.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.525
Nope.

34:28.777 --> 34:29.987
But I'm highly eligible.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.335
Listen, you might need to hang back, okay?

34:45.418 --> 34:47.920
I only told Julia's father
that I was coming, so…

35:07.274 --> 35:12.446
Julia was baptized at that church
and we finally get to bury her there.

35:12.529 --> 35:13.488
Mr. Madrigal.

35:14.698 --> 35:15.782
Turn around.

35:15.866 --> 35:17.326
Mr. Madrigal, I'm Dan Velazquez--

35:17.409 --> 35:20.954
No. I'm done. I'm tired.
I can't do this anymore today.

35:21.038 --> 35:24.583
Mr. Madrigal,
we spoke on the phone, remember?

35:40.349 --> 35:42.309
Maybe try again after everyone's left.

35:42.392 --> 35:44.311
No, I can't push him too much.

35:46.605 --> 35:48.065
Maybe the family made a statement.

36:39.199 --> 36:40.117
Yeah?

36:40.701 --> 36:43.328
Hey, I worked with Julia.

36:43.412 --> 36:44.746
I'm her friend actually.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.331
Okay.

36:53.172 --> 36:56.175
I didn't know when to do this,
but she lent me these.

36:56.258 --> 36:59.261
And I didn't think
I should hang on to 'em.

37:04.516 --> 37:05.517
Yeah.

37:09.313 --> 37:10.731
Leave those on the counter.

38:44.741 --> 38:45.617
Thank you.

38:45.701 --> 38:47.744
Sure you guys don't need
anything else from me?

38:47.828 --> 38:50.330
If you have a statement, I'll take it.

38:56.420 --> 38:57.796
How do you know I'm not a reporter?

39:00.132 --> 39:01.383
Which outlet?

39:02.259 --> 39:03.427
Daily News.

39:06.305 --> 39:08.265
Yeah, you're taking your time
with that deadline.

39:08.348 --> 39:10.309
They've been out of print for ten years.

39:15.939 --> 39:19.943
Know what's funny is
I'll bet you not many people know that.

39:20.027 --> 39:21.028
Yeah.

39:22.779 --> 39:24.489
Yeah, I write for the Sun-Times.

39:27.743 --> 39:29.369
We're still in business.

39:30.704 --> 39:31.914
Barely.

39:32.789 --> 39:34.166
I'm Dan Velazquez.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.669
Oh, sure.

39:38.253 --> 39:42.007
I read you. You--
Yeah, you wrote about Julia.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.092
You knew her?

39:44.176 --> 39:45.594
Nah, I live close.

39:54.728 --> 39:56.230
I've been following the news.

39:56.313 --> 39:58.440
-I hear that they made an arrest.
-Yeah.

39:59.608 --> 40:01.026
Yeah, we'll see if it sticks.

40:07.616 --> 40:09.243
You think it was someone else, huh?

40:16.667 --> 40:18.919
Come on.
You're not very good at this, buddy.

40:19.503 --> 40:22.256
-Yeah, you sound just like my editor.
-Sure.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.258
All right.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.343
-What else should I be doing?
-I don't know.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.389
Maybe not standing around talking to me.

40:30.889 --> 40:32.933
Well, that's what the job is.

40:33.433 --> 40:34.685
Yeah. Well…

40:36.019 --> 40:37.020
No.

40:38.397 --> 40:39.690
Why's everyone else gone?

40:58.917 --> 41:00.544
911, what's your emergency?

41:01.295 --> 41:02.337
Please.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.089
Someone's in my house.

41:04.173 --> 41:05.507
Are they in the house now?

41:06.133 --> 41:08.343
No. No, I don't think so.

41:09.469 --> 41:12.097
Ma'am, how do you know
someone was there? Did you see them?

41:14.183 --> 41:17.144
No, I never do, but he was here.
He was here.

41:17.811 --> 41:19.062
I'll send someone out.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.565
It won't matter. He'll know you're coming.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.694
Hello.

41:26.778 --> 41:28.405
Stop. Just stop!

41:28.906 --> 41:30.157
I called the police.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.368
They'll be there in 18 minutes.

41:35.787 --> 41:36.788
They're here now.

41:37.497 --> 41:38.540
No, they're not.

41:40.459 --> 41:42.711
You see, I'm…

41:44.671 --> 41:46.423
I'm already with you when they arrive.

41:49.218 --> 41:51.220
I'm with you every moment. I'm…

41:53.388 --> 41:55.390
I'm with you through every…

41:58.560 --> 42:00.354
everything that has happened.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.566
Everything that will happen.

42:07.444 --> 42:08.820
I'm with all of you.

42:35.347 --> 42:36.431
Hey. Hey, Dan.

42:39.059 --> 42:41.103
I heard his voice. It's him.

42:45.816 --> 42:47.901
I'm with you every moment. I'm…

42:49.862 --> 42:51.989
I'm with you through every…

42:53.282 --> 42:54.950
everything that has happened.

42:56.285 --> 42:57.744
Everything that will happen.

42:59.705 --> 43:00.914
I'm with all of you.

43:05.502 --> 43:07.212
You took this without telling anyone?

43:07.296 --> 43:10.716
It doesn't matter.
You heard what he said, "all of you."

43:10.799 --> 43:11.800
There's more women.

43:12.801 --> 43:16.847
We can't refer to this tape
without the family's permission.

43:16.930 --> 43:19.766
I will go back.
I will go talk to her father.

43:21.602 --> 43:23.061
CPD needs to know.

43:23.145 --> 43:25.647
They obviously didn't look too hard
for exonerating evidence.

43:27.524 --> 43:30.527
-Why did she hide the tape?
-Because she knew he was coming.

43:32.988 --> 43:34.448
That's all she had time to do.

43:36.617 --> 43:39.203
If you need more help on this,
Bertie's already raised his hand.

43:42.664 --> 43:43.999
I'm good with her.

43:44.082 --> 43:45.876
And the other victim, your source.

43:46.418 --> 43:47.794
What did you find out about her?

43:49.463 --> 43:50.881
She held up just fine.
