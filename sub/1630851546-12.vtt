the kids have shown so far--

14:20.163 --> 14:24.515
the two-circle mark, the skin
irritation, the itchiness,

14:24.602 --> 14:27.301
and the fact that the hex
hasn't killed them yet--

14:27.388 --> 14:30.086
I was able to narrow it down
to these four candidates:

14:30.173 --> 14:32.045
the Malti,the Debrev,

14:32.219 --> 14:34.395

to get rid of any of these?

14:36.571 --> 14:38.486
Technically, yes.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.531

which hex we want to break.

the death switch on these kids?

15:06.166 --> 15:07.819

would have a safe space.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.720
Ay-ay-ay.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.377
Oh, my God.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.823
That is why the antler
fragment was at the orphanage.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.694
Temperance was there
in 1971.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.479
Why? What happened
to the orphanage in 1971?

26:08.697 --> 26:10.090
ACE:
That's when all the kids
disappeared.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.613
Think about it.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.310
Kids and staff at
Fernwood Orphanage.

26:13.484 --> 26:15.008
You at the
Historical Society.

26:15.095 --> 26:16.836
Hannah at the
Copperhead's cage.

26:17.010 --> 26:18.533
I thought they all disappeared
without a trace,

26:18.707 --> 26:21.884
but they left something behind
when they crossed over.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.582
This symbol. A...

26:23.669 --> 26:26.193
tree mark.

26:27.803 --> 26:31.241
I know exactly where
Temperance is keeping Lev.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.897
She took him to
the liminal space.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.856
♪

27:01.054 --> 27:02.751
Poison?

27:04.057 --> 27:05.275
Stop fighting.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.016
This won't hurt.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.070
There are only two hexes left
to choose from.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.333
That's the bright side.BESS:
Yeah,

27:19.507 --> 27:20.464
the not-bright side
is that the clock is ticking

27:20.682 --> 27:22.597
on children's lives.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.512
We have to keep them here
for an impromptu game night

27:24.599 --> 27:26.514
so that we can monitor
them while we fix this.

27:26.601 --> 27:27.689
ACE:
Doesn't look
like they're actually up

27:27.907 --> 27:29.560
for playing games.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.345
I thought Temperance
didn't have the ability

27:31.562 --> 27:33.826
to venture into
the liminal space without help.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.479
Isn't that why she needed us,
a Hudson and a Marvin,

27:35.697 --> 27:37.351
to save Ace and Hannah?

27:37.525 --> 27:39.745
Yeah. Which leads me to believe

27:39.832 --> 27:41.311
that she harnessed some
of our blood during the ritual

27:41.485 --> 27:43.357
when we cut our hands.

27:43.531 --> 27:47.100
Right. We charged her
up like a battery.

27:47.187 --> 27:50.973
Hey, is there any way you could,
um, profile Temperance?

27:51.060 --> 27:53.149
Figure out which one of these
hexes she might be drawn to?

27:53.367 --> 27:55.325
We know she's a narcissist
and a sociopath.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.414
She despises vulnerability.

27:57.588 --> 27:58.981
That'll make her risk-averse

27:59.155 --> 28:00.374
in terms of engaging
with a target.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.332
ACE:
Then maybe
she'll avoid this one.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.814
The Bonnafishex uses totems
from the victims.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.817
Strands of hair, possessions,
that kind of thing.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.776
Did she ever come
inside this building?

28:10.950 --> 28:12.952
No. But she was out back.

28:13.126 --> 28:16.520
Uh, you watch the kids.
I can show you the spot.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.872
[sighs]

28:21.656 --> 28:23.919
BESS: This is where Temperance
was trying to get at the Veil

28:24.006 --> 28:26.748
between the real world
and the darkness below.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.358
That's a story
for another time.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.146
How often
do the kids play back here?

28:33.233 --> 28:35.191
Every day
while Addy and Nick

28:35.365 --> 28:38.064
are-are setting up
arts and crafts inside.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.762
Your research board
listed terra firma hexes.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.285
What does your book
say about those?

28:42.372 --> 28:43.983
Uh...

28:45.245 --> 28:47.508
It says the Prynsipiahex
can be carried to the victim

28:47.595 --> 28:49.162
by elements of land.

28:49.249 --> 28:51.120
Land which Temperance
has manipulated.

28:51.294 --> 28:52.774
That's the one.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.341
BESS:
Wait.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.822
Oh, no.

28:56.996 --> 28:59.041
What? What?
That doesn't sound hopeful.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.043
It says the fatal Prynsipiahex

29:01.217 --> 29:04.046
can be slowed down
or transferred.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.875
But only the person who cast it
can go back and reverse it.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.877
PARK:Temperance won't do
anything to jeopardize

29:09.095 --> 29:11.227
her leverage.No, she doesn't care
about anyone but herself.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.708
And Nancy.

29:13.882 --> 29:16.450
In her letter, she specified
that your existence

29:16.624 --> 29:18.887
as a living,
seventh-generation Hudson

29:19.061 --> 29:20.889
is the key
to restoring Charity's soul.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.673
So, you're saying
that Temperance

29:22.848 --> 29:25.415
has to keep Nancy alive in order
to carry out her master plan.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.243
NANCY: Yeah.
And I'm saying

29:27.417 --> 29:29.071
that in order
to keep the town safe,

29:29.158 --> 29:31.987
Bess, you're gonna transfer
all the kids' hexes onto me.

29:38.733 --> 29:41.170
GEORGE:
All right, I called together
this Fan family meeting

29:41.388 --> 29:43.042
because I realized

29:43.259 --> 29:45.392
you guys deserve
to know the truth.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.611
And the truth is...

29:49.613 --> 29:51.485
Nick and I broke up.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.095
Does Nick not like us?What'd you do?

29:53.269 --> 29:56.490
Okay. [chuckles]
I did not do anything.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.058
And, Ted, he likes you
very, very much.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.061
He likes all of you very much.
It's just that sometimes,

30:02.235 --> 30:03.889
adults need time
to grow separately

30:03.976 --> 30:05.455
so that they can grow together.CHARLIE:
No,

30:05.542 --> 30:07.936
Nick wouldn't just break up
with you for no reason.

30:08.110 --> 30:11.157
You must've driven him away,
just like Mom does

30:11.331 --> 30:12.811
with every good guy.Charlie, that's not fair.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.116
GEORGE:
It was a mutual decision.

30:14.290 --> 30:15.944
We're never gonna
see Nick again.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.251
Hey, he's still gonna be
a very big part of our lives.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.601
He cares about you
very, very much.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.081
We're still friends.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.039
We're-we're still friends!

30:27.086 --> 30:28.000
[phone chimes]

30:31.177 --> 30:34.310
Great. Charlie texted me,
"Trust broken."

30:34.484 --> 30:37.270
Oh, my God.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.662
"Please come back."

30:41.535 --> 30:43.537
She-she blocked me?

30:43.711 --> 30:45.452
Already?
How do you even...?

30:48.107 --> 30:49.325
[sighs]
Oh, my gosh.

30:49.543 --> 30:51.284
Kids today,
am I right?

30:51.371 --> 30:53.112
Jessie, I knew
this would be bad,

30:53.286 --> 30:54.765
but I didn't think...

30:54.940 --> 30:57.246
I didn't think Charlie
would hate me over this.

31:00.554 --> 31:02.295
I hated you once.

31:02.382 --> 31:05.559
Your pep talk
is not helping.Okay.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.170
Remember that time you
burned a microwave dinner

31:08.257 --> 31:10.129
and smoke was everywhere and
everyone was yelling at you

31:10.346 --> 31:12.348
because you read the
instructions wrong?

31:12.566 --> 31:13.697
It was a few years ago.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.395
Oh, I remember.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.920
Well, I told you
you were the worst sister ever.

31:22.054 --> 31:25.579
I only said that because
Mom had been gone for so long,

31:25.753 --> 31:28.364
and I was really scared, George.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.584
Point is,

31:30.758 --> 31:32.455
I didn't mean it,

31:32.542 --> 31:34.762
and I got over it.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.983
So will Charlie. Okay?

31:38.157 --> 31:40.768
I promise.

31:40.942 --> 31:44.424
When did you become
such a grown-up?

Okay.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.959
Okay, can you please
just make this section

31:58.133 --> 32:00.527
a little bit more
circle-like? Thank you.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.793
Um...

32:05.967 --> 32:07.795
Hey.

32:07.969 --> 32:11.190
I, uh, I was meaning
to talk to you.

32:11.407 --> 32:13.105
Kind of off-topic.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.980
Okay.

32:19.198 --> 32:22.288
I really appreciate you
as a person,

32:22.375 --> 32:24.420
and...

32:24.594 --> 32:26.683
As a friend.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.642
Which is not to say

32:28.816 --> 32:32.037
that I have any
regrets at all.

32:32.211 --> 32:36.215
Especially any involving
a-a coat check closet.

[chuckles softly]

32:40.436 --> 32:42.134

32:43.918 --> 32:47.008
You know, there are
a few scientific studies

32:47.182 --> 32:48.836
that confirm

32:48.923 --> 32:52.666
a "friends first" initiation
in a relationship

32:52.840 --> 32:57.062
is the preferred
and prevalent method

32:57.149 --> 33:00.108
of beginning
a long-term relationship.

33:00.282 --> 33:03.677
Are you profiling my-my
relationship with Ace?

33:03.851 --> 33:06.375
Who said anything about Ace?Mm.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.899
You're good.

33:20.215 --> 33:23.349
unless Neptune
is directly, uh, overhead,

33:23.523 --> 33:25.916
which will happen
around midnight.ACE: In the meantime,

33:26.134 --> 33:27.266
we put together this list
of all of the known places

33:27.483 --> 33:29.094
where the tree
symbol appeared.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.051

a person was zapped

33:30.269 --> 33:31.661
into the liminal space.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.359
The Historical Society,
the orphanage,

33:33.576 --> 33:34.925
the Copperhead tunnels
and Darlene's basement.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.057
I feel like Temperance
would want to emerge

33:36.231 --> 33:37.885
somewhere
where she feels comfortable.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.713
Where she can control
the environment.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.976
So, she's not gonna
reemerge at Icarus Hall.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.499
She'd expect us to
wait for her there.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.284
What about the tunnels where
you met the Copperhead?

33:45.458 --> 33:47.721

on the hunt for Lev.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.418
Especially at this hour.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.942
Tunnels are too constricting.
She'd want exit routes.

33:52.117 --> 33:55.468
Stratemeyer Woods by the
orphanage. That would be ideal.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.513
Although
the Historical Society

33:57.731 --> 33:59.124
is closed right now.
That would be

33:59.298 --> 34:00.734
the next best place
to Icarus Hall

34:00.951 --> 34:02.518
if she needs some

would most likely be.
