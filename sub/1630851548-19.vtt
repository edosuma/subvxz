BLOWING THE COVID BACK AT THE

10:10.266 --> 10:10.633
AUDIENCE.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.800
BUT THEN I QUIT DOING THEM

10:13.866 --> 10:15.066
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE THE CROWDS

10:15.133 --> 10:22.200
COMING OUT FOR THOSE SHOWS WERE

10:22.266 --> 10:23.966
ANTIMASK WHO AREN'T THE PEOPLE

10:24.033 --> 10:24.933
WHO ENJOY ME -- NOW I'M EXCITED

10:25.000 --> 10:26.800
TO GO BACK ON THE ROAD AND

10:26.866 --> 10:28.000
EVERYONE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE.

10:28.066 --> 10:29.233
>> Bill: ISN'T THAT SAD

10:29.300 --> 10:29.866
THERE'S AN IDEOLOGICAL COMPONENT

10:29.933 --> 10:31.500
EVEN TO THAT.

10:31.566 --> 10:34.466
IT WAS NOT YOUR CROWD.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.033
>> I FELT IT, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

10:36.100 --> 10:38.133
READY TO GO AND LAUGH IN

10:38.200 --> 10:42.466
SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR WERE NOT

10:42.533 --> 10:43.000
PEOPLE WE SHARE A LOT OF

10:43.066 --> 10:44.900
COMMON --

10:44.966 --> 10:46.300
>> Bill: THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE

10:46.366 --> 10:47.133
DOING THE RED STATES BECAUSE

10:47.200 --> 10:50.566
THEY ARE MORE READY TO LAUGH AND

10:50.633 --> 10:53.366
NOT GO "THAT'S NOT POLITICALLY

10:53.433 --> 10:55.766
CORRECT" AND YOU ARE NOT

10:55.833 --> 10:57.200
POLITICALLY CORRECT, YOU ARE THE

10:57.266 --> 10:57.866
ROAST LADY.

10:57.933 --> 10:58.600
THAT'S WHY HE FIRST SAW YOU AND

10:58.666 --> 11:00.466
FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU BECAUSE

11:00.533 --> 11:01.800
YOU WERE HYSTERICAL ON THOSE

11:01.866 --> 11:05.500
ROASTS, AM I RIGHT?

11:05.566 --> 11:09.400
GOING BACK OUT THERE I'M SO

11:09.466 --> 11:11.066
HAPPY ABOUT IT BUT ALSO BECAUSE

11:11.133 --> 11:11.900
IT CARRIES STRESS BECAUSE OF

11:11.966 --> 11:12.900
THIS AGE WE LIVE IN.

11:12.966 --> 11:15.500
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT,

11:15.566 --> 11:18.033
BECAUSE ARE YOU AFRAID OF THAT?

11:18.100 --> 11:19.300
I WANT TO RIFF AND BE THE

11:19.366 --> 11:20.500
FUNNIEST I CAN BE BUT I DON'T

11:20.566 --> 11:23.833
WANT TO GET CANCELED.

11:23.900 --> 11:24.666
>> I WAS REALLY SCARED OF

11:24.733 --> 11:27.833
GETTING CANCELED FOR A WHILE AND

11:27.900 --> 11:29.333
THEN COVID HIT AND I MOVED BACK

11:29.400 --> 11:31.000
HOME WITH MY PARENTS FOR TEN

11:31.066 --> 11:32.533
MONTHS AND I REALIZE I'VE BEEN

11:32.600 --> 11:34.600
CANCELED, THAT'S GETTING

11:34.666 --> 11:35.633
CANCELED.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.000
I LIVED THE LIFE THAT I WOULD

11:38.066 --> 11:40.166
HAVE LIVED HAD IT SHIT HIT THE

11:40.233 --> 11:42.100
FAN AND IT'S NOT THAT BAD, IT

11:42.166 --> 11:42.733
WAS KIND OF GREAT.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.066
>> Bill: BUT YOU KNEW IT WAS

11:44.133 --> 11:44.733
GOING TO END.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.566
IF IT WAS FOR THE REST OF YOUR

11:47.633 --> 11:49.533
LIFE BACK WITH THE "STAR TREK"

11:49.600 --> 11:51.600
WALLPAPER?

11:51.666 --> 11:54.566
>> I GOT OUT OF THERE EVENTUALLY

11:54.633 --> 11:55.866
AND I DON'T FEAR BEING CANCELED

11:55.933 --> 11:56.866
ANYMORE BECAUSE I CAN'T LIVE IN

11:56.933 --> 11:58.100
THAT STATE OF FEAR BECAUSE I

11:58.166 --> 11:59.200
KNOW AT MY CORE I'M A GOOD

11:59.266 --> 12:01.266
PERSON AND I'M NOT RACIST RIGHT

12:01.333 --> 12:03.400
TRY NOT TO BE RACIST, I TRY MY

12:03.466 --> 12:06.033
BEST NOT TO HURT PEOPLE.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.200
I KNOW THAT SO IF I GET CANCELED

12:08.266 --> 12:09.433
I'LL BE AT PEACE WITH MYSELF AND

12:09.500 --> 12:10.533
I'M ACCOUNTABLE COME I DON'T

12:10.600 --> 12:12.833
MIND APOLOGIZING.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.600
>> Bill: [APPLAUSE]

12:16.666 --> 12:18.033
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BEING

12:18.100 --> 12:20.100
LIKE -- IF I SEE SOMEONE GET UP

12:20.166 --> 12:21.300
DURING MY SHOW BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

12:21.366 --> 12:24.566
I'M DOING A -- I'M WORKING ON

12:24.633 --> 12:30.000
THIS MOLESTATION CHUNK, I CAN DO

12:30.066 --> 12:32.366
THOSE JOKES BECAUSE I WASN'T

12:32.433 --> 12:36.600
MOLESTED SO I DON'T CARE -- I

12:36.666 --> 12:38.266
CAN TALK ABOUT THAT MORE FREELY

12:38.333 --> 12:39.366
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

12:39.433 --> 12:44.133
TRAUMA AROUND IT THAT I REMEMBE

12:44.200 --> 12:44.400
REMEMBER.

12:44.466 --> 12:45.766
WHO KNOWS, IT COULD'VE HAPPENED,

12:45.833 --> 12:47.200
I'M IN THERAPY NOW TO DIG IT

12:47.266 --> 12:48.366
OUT, LET'S FIND IT, IT WOULD

12:48.433 --> 12:52.533
EXPLAIN A LOT.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.733
IT'S WEIRD GOING THERE BECAUSE I

12:53.800 --> 12:55.433
SEE PEOPLE GET UP AND GO I DON'T

12:55.500 --> 12:56.800
WANT TO HEAR THIS BECAUSE

12:56.866 --> 12:57.566
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING I'M SAYING

12:57.633 --> 13:00.133
IS TRIGGERING THEM IN A WAY THAT

13:00.200 --> 13:01.466
THEY'RE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK

13:01.533 --> 13:03.866
AND I THINK ABOUT THAT AND I GO

13:03.933 --> 13:04.400
OKAY, THAT ONE PERSON IS

13:04.466 --> 13:04.866
UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THE

13:04.933 --> 13:07.533
INFORMATION THAT I'M PUTTING OUT

13:07.600 --> 13:10.066
TO THEIR BY TALKING ABOUT IT IS

13:10.133 --> 13:12.033
MORE IMPORTANT.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.066
EVEN THOUGH I'M JOKING ABOUT IT,

13:13.133 --> 13:19.100
I'M STILL ADDRESSING IT AND I'M

13:19.166 --> 13:19.300
I'M --

13:19.366 --> 13:22.466
[APPLAUSE]

13:22.533 --> 13:23.900
>> Bill: THEN WHY APOLOGIZE?

13:23.966 --> 13:26.766
>> I WILL APOLOGIZE TO THAT

13:26.833 --> 13:28.033
PERSON IF THEY SAY I WENT TO

13:28.100 --> 13:29.800
YOUR SHOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME

13:29.866 --> 13:33.000
AND I ENDED UP IN THE BATH ROOM

13:33.066 --> 13:36.433
AND I WOULD SAY I'M SORRY, I

13:36.500 --> 13:38.366
DON'T LIKE TO OFFEND PEOPLE.

13:38.433 --> 13:39.466
>> Bill: I DON'T WANT TO GET

13:39.533 --> 13:41.933
EATEN BY A SHARK BUT I GO IN THE

13:42.000 --> 13:42.466
OCEAN.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.866
YOU ARE A KNOWN COMMODITY NOW.

13:45.933 --> 13:48.100
>> IF A SHARK BIT ME, IF I GOT

13:48.166 --> 13:48.633
ATTACKED BY A SHARK AND I

13:48.700 --> 13:50.600
PUNCHED IT IN THE FACE AND THEY

13:50.666 --> 13:52.633
KILLED THE SHARK IN RETALIATION,

13:52.700 --> 13:53.800
I WOULD WANT TO FIND THAT SHARK

13:53.866 --> 13:54.466
CAN BE LIKE I KNOW YOU WERE JUST

13:54.533 --> 13:58.266
BEING YOU.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.166
I'M SORRY, I WOULD PUNCH IT BUT

13:59.233 --> 14:03.066
I WOULD FEEL BAD.

14:03.133 --> 14:03.500
THE [APPLAUSE]

14:03.566 --> 14:04.700
>> Bill: I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT

14:04.766 --> 14:06.833
THIS UP, YOU ARE ON MY HAWAIIAN

14:06.900 --> 14:08.433

14:08.500 --> 14:09.066
WE ARE DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE

14:09.133 --> 14:11.833
TOGETHER IN HAWAII.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.000
IT'S GOING TO BE AN AMAZING SHOW

14:14.066 --> 14:15.333
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THE

14:15.400 --> 14:18.433
OCEAN, DON'T PUNCH THE SHARK, IT

14:18.500 --> 14:19.066
DOESN'T WORK, YOU'RE NOT GOING

14:19.133 --> 14:21.733
TO KILL THE SHARK WITH A PUNCH

14:21.800 --> 14:23.033
TO T THE KNOW THE NOSE.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.000
>> THAT'S AN OLD WIVES TALE?

14:25.066 --> 14:27.300
>> Bill: OF COURSE, IT'S GOING

14:27.366 --> 14:27.733
TO FUCKING EAT YOU.

14:27.800 --> 14:36.466
>> YOU N NOT SUPPOSED TO WEAR

14:36.533 --> 14:41.800
SPARKLING JEWELRY ARE HAVING

14:41.866 --> 14:42.100
YOUR PERIOD.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.100
>> Bill: YOU PUNCH IT, I'LL

14:44.166 --> 14:44.366
RUN AWAY.

14:44.433 --> 14:47.000
>> RESPONSE TO PEE ON MY SHARK

14:47.066 --> 14:50.600
BITE -- THAT'S JELLYFISH.

14:50.666 --> 14:51.233
TALKING ABOUT GETTING CANCELED,

14:51.300 --> 14:55.100
I JUST DON'T FEAR --

14:55.166 --> 14:56.500
>> Bill: PLEASE DON'T

14:56.566 --> 14:58.100
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THERE'S TOO

14:58.166 --> 14:58.666
MUCH APOLOGIZING IN AMERICA.

14:58.733 --> 15:01.466
>> I LOVE IT.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.866
YOU THINK?

15:04.933 --> 15:06.066
I LOVE APOLOGIZING, IT FEELS SO

15:06.133 --> 15:07.833
GOOD WHEN YOU MEAN IT.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.700
I DON'T MEAN EMPTY APOLOGIES, I

15:09.766 --> 15:12.233
MEAN WHEN SOMEONE IS I REALLY

15:12.300 --> 15:13.600
DON'T CONSIDER SOMEONE COULD

15:13.666 --> 15:13.933
FEEL THAT WAY.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.833
HAVING EMPATHY, THAT SUCKS I

15:15.900 --> 15:17.233
COULD MAKE YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.033
>> Bill: THERE'S ALWAYS GOING

15:19.100 --> 15:20.033
TO BE SOMEBODY.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.166
WE ARE ORGANIZING THIS COUNTRY

15:21.233 --> 15:23.733
AROUND WITH THE MOST OFFENDED

15:23.800 --> 15:25.766
PEOPLE, THE MOST EASILY OFFENDED

15:25.833 --> 15:29.966
PEOPLE WILL REACT TO.

15:30.033 --> 15:30.633
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN I SHOULD BE

15:30.700 --> 15:32.933
ABLE TO SAY IT, JUST DON'T GO TO

15:33.000 --> 15:36.066
MY SHOW.

15:36.133 --> 15:36.433
>> Bill: RIGHT!

15:36.500 --> 15:38.466
DON'T WATCH ME!

15:38.533 --> 15:39.400
OH, GOOD, THEY ARE COMING AROUND

15:39.466 --> 15:42.600
TO ME.

15:42.666 --> 15:43.800
DO YOU DO COLLEGES?

15:43.866 --> 15:45.166
>> I DO, I'LL STILL DO THEM EVEN

15:45.233 --> 15:50.033
THOUGH I KNOW -- WHEN COMICS

15:50.100 --> 15:51.266
DON'T WANT TO DO COLLEGES, I

15:51.333 --> 15:52.833
CALL BULLSHIT ON THAT BECAUSE I

15:52.900 --> 15:53.700
DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT THE FACT

15:53.766 --> 15:54.800
THAT THEY ARE ALL WOKE AND THEY

15:54.866 --> 15:56.233
ARE GOING TO BE GROANING,

15:56.300 --> 15:57.033
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE THAT, THEY

15:57.100 --> 15:58.266
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT IF

15:58.333 --> 15:59.500
COMEDY SHOWS, THEY DON'T KNOW

15:59.566 --> 16:00.866
HOW TO LAUGH OUT LOUD AND BE,

16:00.933 --> 16:05.533
THEY ARE BAD CROWDS.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.233
[LAUGHTER]

16:06.300 --> 16:08.833
IT'S EASY TO GO "I DON'T WANT TO

16:08.900 --> 16:10.066
DO COLLEGES ANYMORE" WHEN YOUR

16:10.133 --> 16:11.033
JERRY SEINFELD BECAUSE I

16:11.100 --> 16:11.666
WOULDN'T WANT TO FLY INTO

16:11.733 --> 16:18.066
SYRACUSE AND DRIVE FOUR HOURS

16:18.133 --> 16:21.166
THROUGH CORNFIELDS -- COLLEGES

16:21.233 --> 16:23.166
ARE THE WORST SCUM OF THE WORLD

16:23.233 --> 16:30.033
THE DASHTHEY'RE THE WORST FOR OF

16:30.100 --> 16:31.766
REASONS.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.833
>> Bill: JERRY AND CHRIS ROCK

16:32.900 --> 16:36.133
AND PETE DAVIDSON, HE'S NOT EVEN

16:36.200 --> 16:36.800
30.

16:36.866 --> 16:38.066
HE SAID HE WON'T DO THEM, HE

16:38.133 --> 16:40.100
SAID YOU'RE JUST SETTING

16:40.166 --> 16:40.966
YOURSELF UP.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.266
>> FOR WHAT, SOMEONE TO BE UPSET

16:43.333 --> 16:44.333
AND NOT BOOK YOU AGAIN AT A

16:44.400 --> 16:45.633
SCHOOL THAT WON'T BOOK YOU FOR

16:45.700 --> 16:49.000
FOUR YEARS ANYWAY?

16:49.066 --> 16:50.100
I'VE DONE COLLEGES WHERE THEY

16:50.166 --> 16:52.900
HAVE WRITTEN INTO THE PAPER AND

16:52.966 --> 16:54.500
SAID -- ONE OF THE HEADLINES

16:54.566 --> 16:57.300
AFTER I PERFORMED WAS NIKKI

16:57.366 --> 17:01.633
GLASER LEAVES MOUTHS GAPING OR

17:01.700 --> 17:05.700
LEAVES CAPERS -- I TALKED ABOUT

17:05.766 --> 17:06.233
GAPING.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.200
PEOPLE WERE GAPING AND I DID

17:08.266 --> 17:09.700
DISCUSS THAT BUT IT WAS A WHOLE

17:09.766 --> 17:09.900
THING.

17:09.966 --> 17:10.833
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT

17:10.900 --> 17:13.766
ABOUT COMEDY, IT MAKES YOU GAPE!

17:13.833 --> 17:15.766
THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO

17:15.833 --> 17:16.466
LOSE.

17:16.533 --> 17:18.433
AREN'T YOU WORRIED THAT ROAST

17:18.500 --> 17:19.300
WILL GO AWAY?

17:19.366 --> 17:21.033
>> THAT'S A PROTECTED SPACE, I

17:21.100 --> 17:22.866
DID FEAR THAT BUT I THINK THAT

17:22.933 --> 17:24.233
IS SO -- WE KNOW THE RULES,

17:24.300 --> 17:25.366
EVERYONE KNOWS AT A TIME WITH

17:25.433 --> 17:26.133
THIS IS GOING TO BE.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.133
I WILL SAY THAT ROAST JOKES,

17:30.200 --> 17:31.300
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TAKEN MY

17:31.366 --> 17:32.866
ROASTED JOKES AND MADE AN

17:32.933 --> 17:33.466
INSTAGRAM THEY'VE WRITTEN IT OUT

17:33.533 --> 17:35.100
AND I'VE COME ACROSS IT AND THE

17:35.166 --> 17:39.866
WRITTEN VERSION OF THAT, WHEN IT

17:39.933 --> 17:40.600
SAYS BLAKE GRIFFIN LOOKS LIKE A

17:40.666 --> 17:41.800
BLACK GUY THAT WAS MADE BY A

17:41.866 --> 17:44.066
PRINTER RUNNING OUT OF INK, THAT

17:44.133 --> 17:45.500
IN THE WRITTEN WORD OUT OF THE

17:45.566 --> 17:46.900
ROAST SETTING I WAS LIKE YIKES.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.366
>> Bill: YOU'RE GOING TO GET

17:48.433 --> 17:49.066
CANCELED JUST FOR THIS

17:49.133 --> 17:50.266
APPEARANCE, YOU'RE NOT GOOD HAVE

17:50.333 --> 17:53.000
TO WORRY ABOUT THIS SPIRIT SOME

17:53.066 --> 17:54.033
PEOPLE HAVE A WAY TO GET AWAY

17:54.100 --> 17:55.800
WITH IT AND I THINK YOU DO, I

17:55.866 --> 18:01.400
HOPE YOU LEAN INTO THAT.

18:01.466 --> 18:02.366
I SAW YOU HOSTED THE MTV

18:02.433 --> 18:05.300
REALITY -- YOU HAD SOME REALLY

18:05.366 --> 18:08.333
ON THE EDGE STUFF THERE.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.000
>> SNUCK HE HECKLED ME.

18:12.066 --> 18:13.533
THEY CUT IT BUT SHE HECKLED ME,

18:13.600 --> 18:20.966
I JUST WENT SNOOKI, NOT HERE.

18:21.033 --> 18:21.833
>> Bill: THAT SNOOKI IS THE

18:21.900 --> 18:22.800
SHARK YOU DON'T WANT TO PUNCH IN

18:22.866 --> 18:26.000
THE NOSE.

18:26.066 --> 18:27.333
[LAUGHTER]

18:41.100 --> 18:42.766
I'M A BIG FAN OF TEMPTATION

18:42.833 --> 18:44.966
ISLAND BUT THE PREMISE OF FUCK

18:46.366 --> 18:48.100

18:48.166 --> 18:51.166
GUYS AND 12 GUYS WHO ARE FUCK

18:51.233 --> 18:54.666
BOYS.

18:54.733 --> 18:59.233
>> NO ONE KNOWS, NOT EVEN ME.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.866
>> Bill: I'M OFFENDED THAT

19:00.933 --> 19:03.500
THIS BECAUSE A NICE GUY, A FUCK

19:03.566 --> 19:05.800
BOY CAN BECOME A NICE GUY AND A

19:05.866 --> 19:06.666
NICE GUY IF YOU'RE LUCKY IT CAN

19:06.733 --> 19:10.266
BECOME A FUCK BOY.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.700
>> I AGREE AND MAYBE WE SEE

19:12.766 --> 19:12.900
THAT.

19:12.966 --> 19:19.366
I FALL FOR F-BOYS CONSISTENTLY

19:19.433 --> 19:21.200
BECAUSE I BELIEVE I CAN CHANGE

19:21.266 --> 19:21.400
THEM.

19:21.466 --> 19:22.200
>> Bill: WHAT IS YOUR RECORD

19:22.266 --> 19:25.833
OF DOING THAT?

19:25.900 --> 19:26.266
>> NEVER.

19:26.333 --> 19:26.633
[LAUGHTER]

19:26.700 --> 19:29.033
IT'S NEVER WORKED AND I NEVER

19:29.100 --> 19:31.800
LOSE HOPE BECAUSE IT WILL HAPPEN

19:31.866 --> 19:32.233
SOMEDAY.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.433
SOMEDAY I WILL REMIND A MAN

19:33.500 --> 19:34.466
ENOUGH OF HIS MOTHER THAT HE'LL

19:34.533 --> 19:37.033
FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.133
>> Bill: AMERICA HAS ALREADY

19:38.200 --> 19:39.400
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU AND I'LL

19:39.466 --> 19:41.933
SEE YOU IN HAWAII.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.600
THE ON THE 30TH OF DECEMBER.

19:46.666 --> 19:49.133
THANK YOU, NIKKI, LET'S MEET OUR

19:49.200 --> 19:52.733
PANEL!

19:52.800 --> 19:53.266
HELLO!

19:53.333 --> 19:55.166
>> HELLO.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.200
>> Bill: HERE THEY ARE!

19:57.266 --> 19:58.766
HE'S A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND

19:58.833 --> 19:59.566
CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: PAUL

19:59.633 --> 20:02.700
BEGALA.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.100
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.066
SHE'S THE HOST OF THE NY TIMES'

20:05.133 --> 20:06.133
PODCAST "THE ARGUMENT": JANE

20:06.200 --> 20:10.400
COASTON.

20:10.466 --> 20:11.566
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THANK YOU

20:11.633 --> 20:15.533
FOR COMING BY.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.866
YOU GUYS, LISTEN TO THIS SPIRIT

20:17.933 --> 20:18.900
OF A NEW REPUBLICAN TALKING

20:18.966 --> 20:22.166
POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.600
THE ATTACK THEY HAD ON THE

20:23.666 --> 20:25.566
CAPITAL THEY HAD ON JANUARY 6TH,

20:25.633 --> 20:29.400
NOW IT'S THE FBI WHO DID IT.

20:29.466 --> 20:29.833
[LAUGHTER]

20:29.900 --> 20:31.400
I WAS IN HERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

20:31.466 --> 20:33.000
MAKING FUN OF THE FACT THAT THEY

20:33.066 --> 20:34.800
WERE SAYING JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO

20:34.866 --> 20:36.733
IT WAS LIBERALS DRESSED UP AS

20:36.800 --> 20:39.000
THEM -- I GUESS THAT'S OUT NOW.

20:39.066 --> 20:42.566
TUCKER CARLSON, I KNOW HOW THIS

20:42.633 --> 20:43.000
GOES.

20:43.066 --> 20:45.233
HE TALKS ABOUT IT FOR A DAY, NOW

20:45.300 --> 20:45.900
THE MY PILLOW GUY IS GOING TO

20:45.966 --> 20:50.633
TWEET IT OUT.

20:50.700 --> 20:51.200
BEFORE THE MONTH IS OUT,

20:51.266 --> 20:55.100
DINESH D'SOUZA WILL HAVE A

20:55.166 --> 20:58.166
DOCUMENTARY "BIDEN'S FBI AND THE

20:58.233 --> 20:59.333
DEATH OF LIBERTY" AND TRUMP WILL

20:59.400 --> 21:02.500
BE LIKE "PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S

21:02.566 --> 21:04.833
THE FBI," SO I GUESS WE ARE BACK

21:04.900 --> 21:06.133
TO BEING AT WAR WITH OUR OWN

21:06.200 --> 21:08.133
SECURITY FORCES.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.233
I SEE THE CAPITOL POLICE WERE

21:11.300 --> 21:12.933
DEVOTED TO GOLD MEDALS FOR

21:13.000 --> 21:15.166
DEFENDING THE CAPITAL AND 21

21:15.233 --> 21:18.600
REPUBLICANS WOULD NOT VOTE FOR

21:18.666 --> 21:18.800
THAT.

21:18.866 --> 21:20.066
FOR THE POLICE.

21:20.133 --> 21:23.533
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

21:23.600 --> 21:27.100
>> ONE REPUBLICAN, A CONGRESSMAN

21:27.166 --> 21:27.700
FROM GEORGIA REFUSED TO SHAKE

21:27.766 --> 21:33.800
THE HAND OF THE OFFICER WHO

21:33.866 --> 21:35.066
HELPED SAVE THE CAPITAL, REFUSED

21:35.133 --> 21:37.400
TO SHAKE HIS HAND.

21:37.466 --> 21:39.600
>> IT'S WEIRD HOW THIS HAS BEEN

21:39.666 --> 21:40.900
WRECKED CONNED MULTIPLE TIMES

21:40.966 --> 21:42.200
AND THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE

21:42.266 --> 21:43.800
VERSIONS.

21:43.866 --> 21:44.700
IF IT'S A WEIRD, COMPLICATED

21:44.766 --> 21:46.233
MUSICAL WHERE THERE ARE THREE

21:46.300 --> 21:47.300
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME

21:47.366 --> 21:49.400
STORY AND EVERYONE KEEPS RUNNING

21:49.466 --> 21:50.033
THROUGH THEM.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.533
FIRST IT WASN'T THAT BAD, THEN

21:51.600 --> 21:54.500
IT WAS ANTIFA, THEN IT'S LIKE

21:54.566 --> 21:57.133
IT'S THE FBI AND YOU SEE THIS

21:57.200 --> 22:01.166
WEIRD ARGUMENT "THE FBI HAS

22:01.233 --> 22:02.200
INFILTRATED THESE GROUPS" AND

22:02.266 --> 22:04.333
TUCKER CARLSON WENT TO THE FBI

22:04.400 --> 22:06.933
DID IT WHICH WOULD BE BAD TO.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.766
>> Bill: WE KNOW THESE CAPITOL

22:08.833 --> 22:11.666
POLICE, THESE VERY BRAVE PEOPLE

22:11.733 --> 22:12.300
WERE ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE AHEAD

22:12.366 --> 22:14.933
OF THE MOB AND THIS IS A MOB

22:15.033 --> 22:18.600
WITH A BLOOD LUST, WE KNOW THIS.

22:18.666 --> 22:22.033
THEY SMEARED FECES ON PELOSI'S

22:22.100 --> 22:23.400
OFFICE WALL, WHEN YOU'RE

22:23.466 --> 22:24.900
COMMUNICATING IN FECES, THAT IS

22:24.966 --> 22:27.866
MY RULE.

22:27.933 --> 22:28.866
[LAUGHTER]

22:28.933 --> 22:30.100
YOU'RE AT A LEVEL WHERE YOU'RE

22:30.166 --> 22:32.966
NOT REALLY RATIONALLY THINKING.

22:33.033 --> 22:34.833
WE KNOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

22:34.900 --> 22:36.366
"HANG MIKE PENCE" WOULD THEY

22:36.433 --> 22:37.233
HAVE STOPPED?

22:37.300 --> 22:38.766
MY QUESTION TO YOU, WHAT IF THEY

22:38.833 --> 22:39.800
WERE A MINUTE AHEAD OF THE

22:39.866 --> 22:41.833
POLICE INSTEAD OF BEHIND?

22:41.900 --> 22:43.533
WHAT IF THEY GOT TO MIKE PENCE,

22:43.600 --> 22:45.633
WHAT IF THEY HAD HANGED HIM?

22:45.700 --> 22:47.400
WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY?

22:47.466 --> 22:50.400
WHAT WOULD REPUBLICANS BE SAYING

22:50.466 --> 22:50.866
TODAY?

22:50.933 --> 22:51.966
>> SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY, DEMOCRATS

22:52.033 --> 23:10.366
WOULD BE WORSE.

23:10.433 --> 23:10.833
>> Bill: YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:10.900 --> 23:11.466
>> THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY.

23:11.533 --> 23:11.966
>> Bill: OR THEY DID IT.

23:12.033 --> 23:12.600
>> OR IT WASN'T THAT BAD OR IT

23:12.666 --> 23:13.166
IS WHATEVER WAS NEEDED, IT'S

23:13.233 --> 23:13.800
INTERESTING HOW THIS IS SOMEHOW

23:13.866 --> 23:14.366
BECOMING JILL BIDEN'S FAULT

23:14.433 --> 23:14.866
DESPITE JANUARY 6TH AND

23:14.933 --> 23:15.466
JANUARY 20TH ARE TWO DIFFERENT

23:15.533 --> 23:15.666
DAYS.

23:15.733 --> 23:16.266
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY EXISTS AS

23:16.333 --> 23:16.833
AN OPPOSITION FORCE.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.066
IT WOULD BE A NEED TO MAKE THIS

23:18.133 --> 23:21.333
A STORY ABOUT ACTUALLY ECONOMIC

23:21.400 --> 23:23.433
ANXIETY AND THIS REALLY WASN'T

23:23.500 --> 23:24.933
THAT BAD AND WASN'T MIKE PENCE

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
KIND OF IRRITATING ANYWAY?

23:29.066 --> 23:30.866
[LAUGHTER]

23:30.933 --> 23:35.266
[APPLAUSE]

23:35.333 --> 23:36.233
>> Bill: THE BIDEN

23:36.300 --> 23:37.766
ADMINISTRATION UNVEILED THIS

23:37.833 --> 23:39.766
NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR COUNTING

23:39.833 --> 23:40.466
DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

23:40.533 --> 23:42.266
WE ARE FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGING THE

23:42.333 --> 23:43.833
SHIFT FROM I WOULD SAY IT GOES

23:43.900 --> 23:45.366
BACK TO 9/11, WE WERE MOST

23:45.433 --> 23:48.233
WORRIED ABOUT IT AND FOR GOOD

23:48.300 --> 23:50.833
REASONS, FOREIGN TERRORISM.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.333
THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE,

23:54.400 --> 23:55.133
SINCE 2015, RIGHT-WING

23:55.200 --> 23:58.366
EXTREMISTS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

23:58.433 --> 23:59.800
267 PLOTS, 91 FATALITIES.

23:59.866 --> 24:03.400
FROM THE LEFT THEY COUNT 66

24:03.466 --> 24:05.666
INCIDENTS AND 19 DEATHS MUSCLE

24:05.733 --> 24:11.100
WE ARE LOSING THIS BATTLE BADLY.

24:11.166 --> 24:16.966
IT'S NOT FOREIGNERS, IT'S PISSED

24:17.033 --> 24:18.400
OFF AMERICANS WHERE THE PROBLEM

24:18.466 --> 24:19.166
NOW, MERRICK GARLAND MADE THE

24:19.233 --> 24:21.033
STATEMENT WE ARE FOCUSED ON

24:21.100 --> 24:22.100
VIOLENCE, NOT AN IDEOLOGY, WE DO

24:22.166 --> 24:25.400
NOT PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR THEIR

24:25.466 --> 24:25.733
BELIEFS.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.700
THERE IS A SWITCH, A WELCOME

24:27.766 --> 24:29.400
SWITCH.

24:29.466 --> 24:30.033
WE DO NOT PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR

24:30.100 --> 24:36.066
THEIR BELIEFS, THE LAST GUY I.

24:36.133 --> 24:37.333
>> AFTER 9/11 A LOT OF

24:37.400 --> 24:38.566
RIGHT-WINGERS WERE SAYING WE

24:38.633 --> 24:39.800
SHOULD DO RACIAL PROFILING, WE

24:39.866 --> 24:43.033
SHOULD TARGET MUSLIMS, THE

24:43.100 --> 24:47.266
ANTIDEFAMATION LEAGUE IT SAYS

24:47.333 --> 24:49.966
TWO YEARS AGO, 90% OF EXTREMIST

24:50.033 --> 24:50.600
RELATED MURDERS WERE COMMITTED

24:50.666 --> 24:52.733
IN AMERICA BY RIGHT-WINGERS COME

24:52.800 --> 24:57.566
OUT YEAR 94% AND IN THOSE TWO

24:57.633 --> 24:58.100
YEARS, ZERO COMMITTED BY

24:58.166 --> 24:58.366
ISLAMISTS.

24:58.433 --> 25:01.200
I'M TRYING TO TELL MY RIGHT-WING

25:01.266 --> 25:02.700
FRIENDS, I'M NO LONGER WORRIED

25:02.766 --> 25:07.233
ABOUT AL QAEDA, I'M WORRIED

25:07.300 --> 25:18.833
ABOUT YA'LL QUEDA.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.333
>> Bill: ARE STILL OUT THERE

25:20.400 --> 25:22.200
BUT WE DID IT WRONG OVERREACTED.

25:22.266 --> 25:24.033
>> THAT IS NOW A MUCH MORE

25:24.100 --> 25:29.666
DIMINISHED THREAT.

25:29.733 --> 25:30.333
>> I THINK THAT IS IN SOME WAYS

25:30.400 --> 25:30.866
CURIOUS BECAUSE ONE OF THE

25:30.933 --> 25:32.800
THINGS THAT IS CHALLENGING,

25:32.866 --> 25:33.433
DOMESTIC TERROR IS NOT A FEDERAL

25:33.500 --> 25:36.266
CRIME BUT THE CRIMES YOU RESULT

25:36.333 --> 25:39.000
IN COMMITTING OUR CRIMES.

25:39.066 --> 25:43.100
34 STATES AND D.C. HAVE LONG TO

25:43.166 --> 25:44.033
MAKE LAWS AGAINST TERRORISM --

25:44.100 --> 25:46.200
IT'S ILLEGAL TO BLOW THE

25:46.266 --> 25:47.200
BUILDING.

25:47.266 --> 25:48.366
TERRORISM, HOW WE THINK ABOUT

25:48.433 --> 25:50.466
THIS A LOT OF TIMES AS

25:50.533 --> 25:51.333
DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL

25:51.400 --> 25:53.466
GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO BE

25:53.533 --> 25:53.966
TERRORISM.

25:54.033 --> 25:54.466
HISTORICALLY THE FEDERAL

25:54.533 --> 25:56.300
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN LIKE WE

25:56.366 --> 25:57.900
HEARD YOU WANTED TO GO AFTER

25:57.966 --> 25:58.866
DOMESTIC EXTREMISM SO WE WENT

25:58.933 --> 26:00.066
AFTER THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE

26:00.133 --> 26:02.133
ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS INSTEAD

26:02.200 --> 26:03.766
OR USE OF THE FBI LABELING

26:03.833 --> 26:07.133
PEOPLE, WE ARE GOING AFTER THE

26:07.200 --> 26:09.366
REAL EXTREMISTS, BLACK IDENTITY

26:09.433 --> 26:10.566
EXTREMISTS.

26:10.633 --> 26:11.533
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
FBI GETTING INVOLVED IN THESE

26:12.666 --> 26:14.433
AND A LOT OF THESE PLOTS BREAK

26:14.500 --> 26:15.133
DOWN BECAUSE EVERYBODY TALKS

26:15.200 --> 26:16.166
ABOUT THEIR PLOTS ON THE

26:16.233 --> 26:17.333
INTERNET WHICH IS WHY YOU

26:17.400 --> 26:19.000
SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT YOUR PLOT

26:19.066 --> 26:21.633
ON THE INTERNET.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.200
[LAUGHTER]

26:22.266 --> 26:22.900
IT DOES RAISE A LOT OF CONCERNS

26:22.966 --> 26:27.066
FOR PRIVACY.

26:27.133 --> 26:31.766
FORTUNATELY IT IS NOT ILLEGAL TO

26:31.833 --> 26:33.200
THINK TERRIBLE THINGS AND TO BE

26:33.266 --> 26:35.566
A MEMBER OF A WHITE NATIONALIST

26:35.633 --> 26:36.366
OR WHITE SEPARATIST

26:36.433 --> 26:36.700
ORGANIZATION.

26:36.766 --> 26:38.766
>> Bill: AND IT SHOULDN'T BE,

26:38.833 --> 26:40.233
YOU CAN'T HAVE THOUGHT CRIMES.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.200
>> YOU CAN'T POLICE THIS AND I

26:43.266 --> 26:44.500
GET CONCERNED OCCASIONALLY THAT

26:44.566 --> 26:45.533
LIBERALS ARE LIKE LET'S POLICE

26:45.600 --> 26:49.800
THIS AND YOU CAN'T DO THIS,

26:49.866 --> 26:50.133
PLEASE DON'T.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.000
>> Bill: THAT'S PLAYING WITH

26:51.066 --> 26:52.433
FIRE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.800
THESE PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY

26:53.866 --> 26:54.833
PLAYING WITH FIRE BECAUSE THE

26:54.900 --> 26:59.066
REPUBLICANS ARE EMBRACING A SORT

26:59.133 --> 27:03.966
OF PROTOPARAMILITARY GROUP IN

27:04.033 --> 27:04.733
AMERICA.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.733
THE PEOPLE WHO KIDNAPPED OR

27:05.800 --> 27:07.566
WANTED TO KIDNAP

27:07.633 --> 27:10.000
GRETCHEN WHITMER, THEY ARE IN

27:10.066 --> 27:10.733
COURT NOW.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.800
THIS WAS A REAL PLOT TO KIDNAP A

27:13.866 --> 27:16.366
GOVERNOR BECAUSE TRUMP HAD

27:16.433 --> 27:16.866
TWEETED OUT "LIBERATED

27:16.933 --> 27:19.000
MICHIGAN."

27:19.066 --> 27:21.200
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH

27:21.266 --> 27:23.366
BORDERLINES, THEY TAKE IT

27:23.433 --> 27:24.433
SERIOUSLY THE "WOLVERINE

27:24.500 --> 27:25.566
WATCHMEN" THAT'S THE NAME OF

27:25.633 --> 27:28.933
THEIR GROUP, VERY CLEVER.

27:29.000 --> 27:29.566
THEY SAID THEY WERE SEEKING TO

27:29.633 --> 27:31.600
STORM THE MICHIGAN CAPITAL AND

27:31.666 --> 27:32.733
THEY SOUGHT A CIVIL WAR.

27:32.800 --> 27:36.900
THEY SEEK THIS.

27:36.966 --> 27:39.500
THE RIGHT, THEY PRETEND ANTIFA

27:39.566 --> 27:41.033
AND BLACK LIVES MATTER ARE THE

27:41.100 --> 27:43.566
EQUIVALENT OF THESE MILITIA

27:43.633 --> 27:44.400
GROUPS, WHO WE USED TO MAKE FUN

27:44.466 --> 27:45.033
OF.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.600
I USED TO DO JOKES ABOUT THEM

27:46.666 --> 27:47.933
THEY WERE PLAYING IN THE WOODS,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.133
IT WAS A BIG EYE ROLL, THEY

27:50.200 --> 27:50.766
AREN'T AN EYE ROLL ANYMORE.

27:50.833 --> 27:54.933
THEY ARE A REAL THREAT AND BLACK

27:55.000 --> 27:55.900
LIVES MATTER AND ANTIFA, THEY

27:55.966 --> 27:59.566
PRETEND THEY ARE THE EQUIVALENT

27:59.633 --> 28:01.000
BUT THEY KNOW WHEN THE CIVIL WAR

28:01.066 --> 28:02.000
COMES WITH THEY ARE REALLY

28:02.066 --> 28:03.466
LOOKING FORWARD TO, ANTIFA IS NO

28:03.533 --> 28:06.366
MATCH FOR THEM, THEY ARE BETTER

28:06.433 --> 28:09.466
ARMED, A LOT OF THEM EX-

28:09.533 --> 28:10.366
EX-MILITARY, THEY ARE GOING TO

28:10.433 --> 28:12.533
WIN THAT ONE IF IT COMES DOWN TO

28:12.600 --> 28:12.866
A SHOOTING --

28:12.933 --> 28:14.800
>> THEY DO HAVE A HABIT OF DOING

28:14.866 --> 28:16.666
ALL THEIR PLANNING ON THE

28:16.733 --> 28:21.733
INTERNET AND TALKING ABOUT IT.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.800
[LAUGHTER]

28:22.866 --> 28:23.633
>> Bill: THAT'S OUR ACE IN THE

28:23.700 --> 28:24.033
HOLE.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.166
>> IF YOU GO THROUGH SOME OF

28:26.233 --> 28:27.300
THESE CHARGING DOCUMENTS -- I

28:27.366 --> 28:28.766
LIVE IN D.C., I WAS THERE ON

28:28.833 --> 28:30.200
JANUARY 6 THAT IT WAS VERY WEIRD

28:30.266 --> 28:32.833
AND VERY STRANGE BUT YOU SEE

28:32.900 --> 28:34.700
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE "TAKING A

28:34.766 --> 28:36.333
SELFIE AFTER BREAKING A WINDOW

28:36.400 --> 28:37.866
IN THE CAPITAL" AND THEY ARE

28:37.933 --> 28:38.833
LIKE HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW

28:38.900 --> 28:41.866
IT WAS ME?

28:41.933 --> 28:45.366
COME ON.

28:45.433 --> 28:45.933
>> Bill: A GUY ALSO BRAGGED

28:46.000 --> 28:49.900
ABOUT IT ON A DATING SITE AND

28:49.966 --> 28:50.300
GOT ARRESTED TO.

28:50.366 --> 28:53.566
>> WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH THE

28:53.633 --> 28:55.533
MOST SUPREME WHITE PEOPLE HERE.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.733
>> IT'S STUPID AND DANGEROUS BUT

28:59.800 --> 29:00.600
AGAIN --

29:00.666 --> 29:02.133
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE HERE, WE

29:02.200 --> 29:03.500
KNOW THIS CAN GO TERRIBLY WRONG

29:03.566 --> 29:05.533
AND WE'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE,

29:05.600 --> 29:08.466
WE SOUGHT WITH OKLAHOMA CITY.

29:08.533 --> 29:09.566
WE SOUGHT WITH RUBY RIDGE IN

29:09.633 --> 29:11.300
WACO AND A HOST OF OTHER EVENTS

29:11.366 --> 29:14.900
AND THE CONCERN HERE IS HOW THE

29:14.966 --> 29:15.500
FBI AND SECURITY AGENCIES DO

29:15.566 --> 29:18.733
BASICALLY EVERYTHING, WHICH IS

29:18.800 --> 29:21.133
TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY,

29:21.200 --> 29:21.700
OVEREMPHASIZE INVASIONS OF

29:21.766 --> 29:23.533
PRIVACY AND BUMBLE ALONG IS

29:23.600 --> 29:24.833
GOING TO GET US INTO A DISASTER.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.366
>> Bill: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

29:27.433 --> 29:28.766
THE OTHER CRIME ISSUE WHICH IS

29:28.833 --> 29:29.633
STREET CRIME WHICH IS GOING ON

29:29.700 --> 29:32.433
IN A VERY BIG WAY RIGHT NOW.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.200
49% OF THE PEOPLE SAY IT'S A

29:33.266 --> 29:37.033
VERY BIG PROBLEM.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.566
THE LARGEST SINGLE YEAR INCREASE

29:38.633 --> 29:41.100
IN HOMICIDES SINCE 1960 AND THE

29:41.166 --> 29:42.200
NEW YORK MAYORAL RACE, THE

29:42.266 --> 29:43.166
PRIMARY IS TUESDAY WHOEVER WINS

29:43.233 --> 29:44.766
THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MAYOR OF

29:44.833 --> 29:46.433
NEW YORK, THAT IS THE BIG ISSUE

29:46.500 --> 29:48.366
AND THE LEADING CANDIDATE, THIS

29:48.433 --> 29:49.433
IS VERY NEW.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.200
ERIC ADAMS, I'M JUST LEARNING

29:51.266 --> 29:52.500
ABOUT HIM.

29:52.566 --> 29:54.600
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, EX-COP,

29:54.666 --> 29:56.333
EX-REPUBLICAN.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.966
I LOVE THIS "STRAPPED ALL THE

29:59.033 --> 30:00.166
TIME."

30:00.233 --> 30:01.166
THIS GUY GOES TO CHURCH WITH A

30:01.233 --> 30:01.633
GUN.

30:01.700 --> 30:05.366
AND HE'S GOT THE ISSUE, CRIME.

30:05.433 --> 30:06.633
IT MAY BE BIG BLUE NEW YORK BUT

30:06.700 --> 30:10.166
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT IT AND HE

30:10.233 --> 30:12.366
IS THE ONE, WHEN THEY WERE ALL

30:12.433 --> 30:15.200
ZIGGING, HE WAS ZAGGING.

30:15.266 --> 30:16.600
TO FUND THE POLICE?

30:16.666 --> 30:17.400
NO.

30:17.466 --> 30:19.033
HE'S TALKING ABOUT OPPOSITION TO

30:19.100 --> 30:20.400
DEFUNDING THE POLICE, OPPOSITION

30:20.466 --> 30:23.200
TO IT WINDS ACROSS EVERYTHING.

30:23.266 --> 30:25.333
RACE, IDEOLOGY, AGE, MY QUESTION

30:25.400 --> 30:26.566
FOR THE DEMOCRATS WERE PANDERING

30:26.633 --> 30:28.200
TO THAT, WHO WAS IT FOR?

30:28.266 --> 30:30.166
WHO ARE YOU GETTING?

30:30.233 --> 30:34.333
>> IT'S FOR 15% OF THE PARTY WHO

30:34.400 --> 30:36.566
ARE THE OVEREDUCATED, OVER

30:36.633 --> 30:37.800
CAFFEINATED, OVER OPINIONATED,

30:37.866 --> 30:39.066
PAIN IN THE WHITE LIBERALS ON

30:39.133 --> 30:39.433
TWITTER.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.033
I GUESS WE GOT TO HAVE THEM.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.233
I CHECK IN WITH THE DEMOCRATIC

30:44.300 --> 30:45.533
POLLSTERS, THEY SAY IN

30:45.600 --> 30:47.200
DEMOCRATIC DOMINATED CITIES,

30:47.266 --> 30:48.900
CRIME HAS NOW PASSED EDUCATION

30:48.966 --> 30:50.233
AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AS THE

30:50.300 --> 30:51.233
NUMBER ONE ISSUE.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.333
A SMART DEMOCRATS ARE LISTENING

30:53.400 --> 30:54.366
TO THAT.

30:54.433 --> 30:55.366
VAL DEMINGS A FORMER POLICE

30:55.433 --> 30:56.333
CHIEF CONGRESSWOMAN FROM

30:56.400 --> 30:58.033
FLORIDA, SHE'S RUNNING FOR

30:58.100 --> 30:58.666
SENATE AND HER ANNOUNCEMENT SHE

30:58.733 --> 31:01.066
TALKS ABOUT HAVING BEEN A POLICE

31:01.133 --> 31:02.466
CHIEF.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.500
IF YOU ARE SEEING THAT AROUND

31:03.566 --> 31:04.433
THE COUNTRY.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.933
IF YOU'RE IN L.A., A FORMER COP

31:06.000 --> 31:06.800
RUNNING FOR MAYOR -- I DON'T

31:06.866 --> 31:08.766
KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO BUT

31:08.833 --> 31:09.433
YOU'RE SEEING IT.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.566
DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT TO GET ON

31:10.633 --> 31:13.766
OFFENSE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S

31:13.833 --> 31:14.666
REAL.

31:14.733 --> 31:16.233
JEFF BEZOS IS NOT GOING TO GET

31:16.300 --> 31:17.033
MUGGED, IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

31:17.100 --> 31:18.600
IN MY PARTY WHO SUFFERED THE

31:18.666 --> 31:20.166
MOST FROM CRIME.

31:20.233 --> 31:24.000
>> [APPLAUSE]

31:24.066 --> 31:25.400
>> BUT WHAT YOU HEARD FROM

31:25.466 --> 31:27.200
PEOPLE AND WHAT YOU HEARD FROM

31:27.266 --> 31:29.266
MIDDLE-CLASS AFRICAN-AMERICAN

31:29.333 --> 31:30.733
COMMUNITIES FOR YEARS IS THAT

31:30.800 --> 31:31.833
YOU HAVE SIMULTANEOUS OVER

31:31.900 --> 31:32.966
POLICING AND UNDER POLICING.

31:33.033 --> 31:36.100
IF YOU LOOK AT HOMICIDE

31:36.166 --> 31:37.966
CLEARANCE RATES IN MAJOR CITIES,

31:38.033 --> 31:40.366
HONOLULU THERE'S A 25% HOMICIDE

31:40.433 --> 31:41.633
CLEARANCE RATES, THAT MEANS IN

31:41.700 --> 31:43.166
ONE OF THE FOUR CASES, A

31:43.233 --> 31:43.933
HOMICIDE CASE IS CLOSED, THAT

31:44.000 --> 31:45.600
DOESN'T MEAN CLOSE, THAT DOESN'T

31:45.666 --> 31:49.033
NECESSARILY MEAN SOLVED, IT

31:49.100 --> 31:51.566
MEANS CLOSED.

31:51.633 --> 31:53.333
WHAT EXACTLY ARE POLICE DOING?

31:53.400 --> 31:53.700
WHO KNOWS?

31:53.766 --> 31:57.033
WHO CAN SAY?

31:57.100 --> 31:59.766
WHEN I HEARD PEOPLE TALKING D

31:59.833 --> 32:01.366
FROM THE POLICE, I HEARD IT IN

32:01.433 --> 32:02.900
THE WAY THAT THIS RESTAURANT

32:02.966 --> 32:04.000
SUCKS, WE DO NOT WANT THIS

32:04.066 --> 32:05.033
RESTAURANT TO KEEP BEING LIKE

32:05.100 --> 32:07.100
THIS RESTAURANT ANYMORE.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.733
>> Bill: IT WAS A POOR CHOICE

32:08.800 --> 32:12.100
OF WORDS.

32:12.166 --> 32:13.400
REFORMING WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER.

32:13.466 --> 32:15.700
>> THERE IS ALSO A SENSE THAT

32:15.766 --> 32:17.400
AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING

32:17.466 --> 32:20.033
THE BIGGEST DEFUNDING THE POLICE

32:20.100 --> 32:22.200
IN 2019 AND 2020 WAS

32:22.266 --> 32:23.133
DONALD TRUMP BY PULLING MONEY

32:23.200 --> 32:26.133
FROM SO-CALLED SANCTUARY CITIES.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.566
I THINK ERIC ADAMS AND THERE ARE

32:27.633 --> 32:31.933
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT --

32:32.000 --> 32:32.933
WHO ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

32:33.000 --> 32:34.033
THIS BUT IF YOU CAN THREAD THE

32:34.100 --> 32:36.333
NEEDLE, WHEN I CALL THE POLICE,

32:36.400 --> 32:37.700
SOMEONE SHOULD, AND THE POLICE

32:37.766 --> 32:39.100
SHOULD NOT SIT OUTSIDE MY

32:39.166 --> 32:40.066
APARTMENT WAITING FOR SOMETHING

32:40.133 --> 32:42.700
TO HAPPEN SO THEY CAN BUST ME ON

32:42.766 --> 32:44.566
SOMETHING AND KNOW THEY CAN

32:44.633 --> 32:46.100
VIOLATE MY RIGHTS AND RECEIVE

32:46.166 --> 32:47.166
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IN COURT

32:47.233 --> 32:47.800
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT MADE

32:47.866 --> 32:49.500
IT UP, I THINK THAT IS A NEEDLE

32:49.566 --> 32:56.233
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INTO.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.300
>> IT'S NOT JUST UNFORTUNATE,

32:59.366 --> 32:59.900
THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR STUPIDITY

32:59.966 --> 33:04.400
WHOEVER CAME UP FOR THAT -- THE

33:04.466 --> 33:05.733
ONLY POLITICAL PARTY WHO WAS

33:05.800 --> 33:07.066
DEFUND THE POLICE IN CONGRESS

33:07.133 --> 33:09.200
ARE THE REPUBLICANS, NOT ONLY

33:09.266 --> 33:10.166
MR. TRUMP, EVERY SINGLE

33:10.233 --> 33:12.566
REPUBLICAN VOTED AGAINST

33:12.633 --> 33:13.233
JOE BIDEN'S $350 BILLION AIDS TO

33:13.300 --> 33:14.733
CITIES AND STATES, A PORTION OF

33:14.800 --> 33:15.400
THAT GOES TO POLICE.

33:15.466 --> 33:18.133
I'M A DEMOCRAT RUNNING, YOU WANT

33:18.200 --> 33:18.733
TO DEFUN THE POLICE AND YOU

33:18.800 --> 33:23.100
WANT TO DEFEND THE POLICE WHEN

33:23.166 --> 33:24.000
RIDERS ATTACKED THEM.

33:24.066 --> 33:25.433
WE NEED TO DE-ESCALATE THE

33:25.500 --> 33:27.233
VIOLENCE, WHY AREN'T DEMOCRATS

33:27.300 --> 33:27.933
TALKING ABOUT THIS IN

33:28.000 --> 33:29.566
WASHINGTON?

33:29.633 --> 33:33.666
THERE'S A GRANT PROGRAM -- COP

33:33.733 --> 33:35.033
GRANTS CITIES GET, MAKE THOSE

33:35.100 --> 33:36.800
FUNDS CONTINGENT ON YOU

33:36.866 --> 33:38.000
RETRAINING YOUR COPS AND

33:38.066 --> 33:38.966
DE-ESCALATION SO THEY DON'T

33:39.033 --> 33:40.833
CHOKE OUT A MAN LIKE ERIC GARNER

33:40.900 --> 33:43.000
FOR SELLING LOOSE CIGARETTES.

33:43.066 --> 33:44.733
>> ALSO SELLING LOOSE CIGARETTES

33:44.800 --> 33:45.966
SHOULDN'T BE A CRIME.

33:46.033 --> 33:47.833
>> THAT IS THE OVER POLICING.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.700
>> Bill: I USED TO SELL LOOSE

33:50.766 --> 33:52.166
JOINTS.

33:52.233 --> 33:53.133
I DID.

33:53.200 --> 33:53.933
DEMOCRATS ARE VERY FRUSTRATED

33:54.000 --> 33:58.800
WITH THIS GUY JOE MANCHIN, THEY

33:58.866 --> 34:00.066
ARE 50-50 -- THERE HE IS AND

34:00.133 --> 34:02.566
HE'S FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND HE'S

34:02.633 --> 34:06.966
A DEMOCRAT BUT HE'S IN A STATE,

34:07.033 --> 34:13.633
TTHE PLEA 2-EST STATE IN THE

34:13.700 --> 34:15.700
NATION SO WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD

34:15.766 --> 34:17.700
BE A GREAT WEEK TO DO 24 THINGS

34:17.766 --> 34:19.766
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

34:19.833 --> 34:22.066
JOE MANCHIN.

34:22.133 --> 34:24.300
FOR EXAMPLE,

34:24.366 --> 34:25.133
I'M A DEMOCRAT, EXCEPT ON

34:25.200 --> 34:29.800
MATTERS OF POLICY.

34:29.866 --> 34:30.100
[LAUGHTER]

34:30.166 --> 34:31.100
WHEN LIBERALS CALL ME A

34:31.166 --> 34:32.633
COCKSUCKER I SAY, "IT'S

34:32.700 --> 34:35.666
PRONOUNCED KOCH."

34:35.733 --> 34:38.200
[LAUGHTER]

34:38.266 --> 34:39.533
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:39.600 --> 34:40.266
TO AVOID BEING BRANDED AN

34:40.333 --> 34:41.333
ELITIST, I BLACK OUT TWO OF MY

34:41.400 --> 34:45.166
TEETH.

34:45.233 --> 34:47.700
[LAUGHTER]

34:47.766 --> 34:51.833
I ALWAYS ROOT FOR THE OVERDOG.

34:51.900 --> 34:52.100
[LAUGHTER]

34:52.166 --> 34:53.533
[APPLAUSE]

34:53.600 --> 34:55.000
LINDSEY GRAHAM ONCE ACCUSED ME

34:55.066 --> 35:01.433
OF BEING A CLOSETED REPUBLICAN.

35:01.500 --> 35:01.700
[LAUGHTER]

35:01.766 --> 35:02.500
[APPLAUSE]

35:02.566 --> 35:03.733
I ONCE ACTUALLY PEED ON A

35:03.800 --> 35:08.366
PARADE.

35:08.433 --> 35:08.633
[LAUGHTER]

35:08.700 --> 35:09.966
BEFORE STOPPING A COYOTE FROM

35:10.033 --> 35:10.700
ATTACKING A CHILD, I LIKE TO

35:10.766 --> 35:18.433
HEAR THE COYOTE OUT.

35:18.500 --> 35:18.700
[LAUGHTER]

35:18.766 --> 35:19.466
[APPLAUSE]

35:19.533 --> 35:20.166
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP SAYING

35:20.233 --> 35:20.833
I REALLY WANT TO BE A

35:20.900 --> 35:21.433
REPUBLICAN.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.300
I DON'T.

35:22.366 --> 35:23.466
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND BEING

35:23.533 --> 35:24.700
INVITED TO ONE OF MATT GAETZ'S

35:24.766 --> 35:31.933
PARTIES.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

35:33.966 --> 35:35.566
THAT IS THE STANDARD LIBERAL WAY

35:35.633 --> 35:36.733
TO LOOK AT JOE MANCHIN BUT THERE

35:36.800 --> 35:37.933
IS ANOTHER WAY, I KNOW YOU OF

35:38.000 --> 35:39.200
ALL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE

35:39.266 --> 35:41.033
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT, AM

35:41.100 --> 35:41.600
I RIGHT?

35:41.666 --> 35:43.500
>> HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE, HE'S A

35:43.566 --> 35:46.766
REAL DEMOCRAT AND LIBERALS

35:46.833 --> 35:47.966
SHOULD LOVE HIM BECAUSE HE'S AN

35:48.033 --> 35:48.800
ENDANGERED SPECIES.

35:48.866 --> 35:50.800
THEY SHOULD BUILD HIM A SAFE

35:50.866 --> 35:52.000
NEST.

35:52.066 --> 35:52.766
>> Bill: BECAUSE?

35:52.833 --> 35:54.500
>> BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS A STATE

35:54.566 --> 35:56.533
WITH 55 COUNTIES, NOT ONE OF

35:56.600 --> 35:59.033
THEM HAS VOTED FOR A DEMOCRAT IN

35:59.100 --> 35:59.466
12 YEARS.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.500
>> Bill: HE'S A DEMOCRAT WHO

36:00.566 --> 36:02.566
WON IN A STATE FULL OF RURAL

36:02.633 --> 36:03.666
WHITE VOTERS WHICH THEY DON'T

36:03.733 --> 36:14.000
HAVE ANY MORE.

36:14.066 --> 36:14.633
>> HE WAS A SECRETARY OF STATE

36:14.700 --> 36:15.233
BEFORE THAT, A GOOD RECORD AS

36:15.300 --> 36:15.866
SECRETARY OF STATE, COMMITMENT

36:15.933 --> 36:16.533
TO VOTING RIGHTS, HE'S TRYING TO

36:16.600 --> 36:17.166
PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT CAN

36:17.233 --> 36:17.733
ACTUALLY PASS AND I THINK IS

36:17.800 --> 36:18.100
ONTO SOMETHING.

36:18.166 --> 36:18.800
I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER GOING TO

36:18.866 --> 36:19.433
GET 60, HE'S NOT GOING TO GET

36:19.500 --> 36:20.466
TEN REPUBLICANS BUT HE'S GOING

36:20.533 --> 36:23.300
TO DIE TRYING AND THEN THERE

36:23.366 --> 36:25.566
WILL BE AN IRREFUTABLE CASE FOR

36:25.633 --> 36:26.566
REFORMING THE FILIBUSTER AND

36:26.633 --> 36:28.166
PASSING VOTING RIGHTS WITHOUT

36:28.233 --> 36:29.066
REPUBLICANS, I THINK THAT THE

36:29.133 --> 36:32.866
PROCESS WE GO THROUGH.

36:32.933 --> 36:33.466
[APPLAUSE]

36:33.533 --> 36:34.333
>> Bill: THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A

36:34.400 --> 36:36.233
GUY WHO VOTES WITH THEM HALF THE

36:36.300 --> 36:37.600
TIME AND IF HE WASN'T THERE,

36:37.666 --> 36:41.966
THEY WOULD HAVE A GUY --

36:42.033 --> 36:45.966
>> 80% YOU HAVE WINDS AGAINST

36:46.033 --> 36:48.233
REPLACEMENT, WAR, HOW WOULD YOUR

36:48.300 --> 36:50.033
TEAM DO WITH AN AVERAGE SECOND

36:50.100 --> 36:51.200
BASEMAN?

36:51.266 --> 36:51.766
JOE MANCHIN HAS THE HIGHEST

36:51.833 --> 36:54.600
WINDS AGAINST REPLACEMENT OF

36:54.666 --> 36:55.366
ANYONE IN AMERICAN POLITICS.

36:55.433 --> 36:56.133
>> Bill: LIKE I SAID, HE'S A

36:56.200 --> 36:58.466
GREAT GUY.

36:58.533 --> 37:01.100
LET ME ASK YOU, ARE YOU FROM

37:01.166 --> 37:01.300
TEXAS?

37:01.366 --> 37:02.600
>> I AM FROM TEXAS.

37:02.666 --> 37:05.366
>> Bill: I KNOW YOU WANT FROM

37:05.433 --> 37:06.566
NEW JERSEY.

37:06.633 --> 37:07.900
TEXAS, THIS PLACE IS GOING A

37:07.966 --> 37:08.766
LITTLE NUTS.

37:08.833 --> 37:09.400
THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BUILD

37:09.466 --> 37:13.700
HIS OWN BORDER WALL.

37:13.766 --> 37:15.866
THEY ARE PASSING AN ABORTION

37:15.933 --> 37:18.333
LAW, SIX WEEKS, SIX WEEKS BEFORE

37:18.400 --> 37:19.966
MOST WOMEN EVEN KNOW THEY ARE

37:20.033 --> 37:20.366
PREGNANT.

37:20.433 --> 37:21.033
YOU CAN HAVE AN ABORTION AS LONG

37:21.100 --> 37:26.200
AS YOU DON'T KNOW YOU NEED ONE.

37:26.266 --> 37:27.400
THE GOVERNOR SAYS HE'S GOING TO

37:27.466 --> 37:28.866
ARREST PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE

37:28.933 --> 37:31.900
BORDER, HE'S GOING TO DO THIS

37:31.966 --> 37:33.500
AND YET THEY ARE LOSING LATINO

37:33.566 --> 37:36.533
VOTERS IN TEXAS.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.866
McALLEN, TEXAS, IS 85% LATINO

37:37.933 --> 37:40.266
AND IT JUST VOTED FOR A

37:40.333 --> 37:43.533
REPUBLICAN MAYOR.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.200
BIDEN UNDERPERFORMED HUGELY IN

37:44.266 --> 37:46.766
THOSE BORDER COUNTIES IN THE

37:46.833 --> 37:48.233
2020 ELECTION, WHAT DO YOU MAKE

37:48.300 --> 37:49.600
OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

37:49.666 --> 37:51.733
>> I AM FROM THERE AND I TALKED

37:51.800 --> 37:54.200
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE DOWN THERE,

37:54.266 --> 37:55.400
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

37:55.466 --> 37:57.166
IN THAT BORDER AREA, THE MOST

37:57.233 --> 37:59.866
DEMOCRATIC AREA IN TEXAS WE LOST

37:59.933 --> 38:02.033
50 POINTS, COUNTIES THAT HILLARY

38:02.100 --> 38:04.366
WON BY 50 OR 60, JOE WON BY ONE

38:04.433 --> 38:04.666
OR TWO.

38:04.733 --> 38:06.633
WHAT THEY TOLD ME IS THIS, IT'S

38:06.700 --> 38:07.900
THE POOREST PLACE IN AMERICA,

38:07.966 --> 38:10.000
THE ONLY WAY OUT IS TO WORK IN

38:10.066 --> 38:11.533
FRACKING OR WORK IN THE BORDER

38:11.600 --> 38:12.866
PATROL AND WORK FOR THE POLICE

38:12.933 --> 38:14.600
AND YOU GUYS SEEM TO BE AGAINST

38:14.666 --> 38:15.233
ALL OF THAT.

38:15.300 --> 38:17.400
I THINK DEMOCRATS SHOULD GET ON

38:17.466 --> 38:19.133
OFFENSE, THIS GOVERNOR IN TEXAS

38:19.200 --> 38:19.966
GREG ABBOTT CAN'T KEEP THE

38:20.033 --> 38:21.233
LIGHTS ON.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.700
I HAVE A FRIEND WHOSE AUNT FROZE

38:22.766 --> 38:23.400
TO DEATH DURING THAT STORM IN

38:23.466 --> 38:25.500
FEBRUARY.

38:25.566 --> 38:28.066
HE CAN'T KEEP THE POWER OF

38:28.133 --> 38:28.900
KNOWING, WE CAN'T HAVE A SMART

38:28.966 --> 38:30.333
GRID BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

38:30.400 --> 38:31.566
STUPID WALL, THAT'S NOT GOING TO

38:31.633 --> 38:32.600
SAVE ANYBODY'S LIFE AND I THINK

38:32.666 --> 38:34.433
DEMOCRATS WANT TO PUT ON TRIAL

38:34.500 --> 38:38.500
FOR THAT, POLITICALLY.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.966
[APPLAUSE]

38:41.033 --> 38:42.500
>> WE SEE A LOT OF STUPID

38:42.566 --> 38:44.366
POSITIONAL SIGNALING, YOU SEE

38:44.433 --> 38:46.333
THAT WITH THE OHIO REPUBLICAN

38:46.400 --> 38:47.766
PRIMARY TO REPLACE ROB PORTMAN,

38:47.833 --> 38:49.166
YOU HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

38:49.233 --> 38:50.466
WHO'S IN THE MIDST OF LEGAL

38:50.533 --> 38:51.100
PROBLEMS THAT SEEM TO GO BACK A

38:51.166 --> 38:54.966
LONG WAYS.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.066
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL.

38:56.133 --> 38:57.366
UNDER INDICTMENT FOR FRAUD TO.

38:57.433 --> 39:01.933
>> THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.100
YOUR ATTORNEY GENERAL IS UNDER

39:03.166 --> 39:04.966
INDICTMENT, THAT FEELS GOOD.

39:05.033 --> 39:06.266
THIS IS A POSITIONING FIGHT,

39:06.333 --> 39:07.800
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT'S

39:07.866 --> 39:08.500
LIKE "THIS IS GOING TO DO SO

39:08.566 --> 39:11.566
WELL ON TWITTER" AND YOU SEE

39:11.633 --> 39:13.900
THAT ACROSS THE REPUBLICAN

39:13.966 --> 39:15.000
PARTY.

39:15.066 --> 39:15.733
HAVING MOMENTS AND PLACES WHAT

39:15.800 --> 39:17.266
IT'S LIKE THIS IS GOING TO LOOK

39:17.333 --> 39:17.500
GREAT.

39:17.566 --> 39:19.433
AM I GOING TO DEAL WITH THE FACT

39:19.500 --> 39:20.233
THAT THE POWER GRID CAN'T HANDLE

39:20.300 --> 39:21.766
IT WHEN IT'S COLD AND CAN HANDLE

39:21.833 --> 39:24.166
IT WHEN IT'S HOT?

39:24.233 --> 39:24.533
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.566
AM I GOING TO PASS A BILL THAT

39:26.633 --> 39:28.100
AOC IS GOING TO RETWEET AND TED

39:28.166 --> 39:29.400
CRUZ IS GOING TO RETWEET THAT

39:29.466 --> 39:30.533
AND EVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE A

39:30.600 --> 39:33.466
DUMB FIGHT ON THE INTERNET?

39:33.533 --> 39:33.766
ABSOLUTELY.

39:33.833 --> 39:35.600
>> Bill: I'M READING THIS

39:35.666 --> 39:37.233
SURVEY OF LATINO VOTERS IN

39:37.300 --> 39:38.500
BATTLEGROUND STATES, 80% THINK

39:38.566 --> 39:43.133
THE PUBLIC ARE FAILING.

39:43.200 --> 39:43.966
63% AGREE FREE-MARKET CAPITALISM

39:44.033 --> 39:46.900
IS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT,

39:46.966 --> 39:48.333
67% THINK AMERICANS ARE LOSING

39:48.400 --> 39:51.933
TRADITIONAL VALUES, 66% AGREE

39:52.000 --> 39:52.633
CANCEL CULTURE HAS GOTTEN TOO

39:52.700 --> 39:55.300
FAR OUT OF HAND AND I WAS

39:55.366 --> 39:56.966
READING ALSO ABOUT LIN-MANUEL

39:57.033 --> 40:01.133
MIRANDA THIS WEEK, HAMILTON FAN,

40:01.200 --> 40:02.500
HE WON PULITZER PRIZE FOR IT.

40:02.566 --> 40:06.333
HE GOT A NEW MUSICAL CALLED THE

40:06.400 --> 40:07.333
HEIGHTS, ABOUT WASHINGTON

40:07.400 --> 40:09.400
HEIGHTS, I KNEW THAT

40:09.466 --> 40:10.033
NEIGHBORHOOD, MY FATHER PARKED

40:10.100 --> 40:11.633
IN IT EVERY DAY IN HIS LIFE

40:11.700 --> 40:14.466
COMING FROM NEW JERSEY AND

40:14.533 --> 40:16.400
TAKING THE SUBWAY FROM MIDTOWN.

40:16.466 --> 40:18.033
HE WROTE THE MUSIC AND LYRICS,

40:18.100 --> 40:18.800
HIS PARENTS ARE PUERTO RICAN,

40:18.866 --> 40:20.766
CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN

40:20.833 --> 40:22.733
PUERTO RICO.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.500
THE BOOK IS BY SOMEONE WHO IS

40:23.566 --> 40:26.300
HALF PUERTO RICAN.

40:26.366 --> 40:28.333
I GOT 96% ROTTEN TOMATOES,

40:28.400 --> 40:31.633
PEOPLE LOVED IT.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.933
GREAT REVIEWS FOR WHICH HE HAS

40:34.000 --> 40:36.966
APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY.

40:37.033 --> 40:38.633
WHY?

40:38.700 --> 40:44.766
WELL THERE IS LATINX PERFORMERS,

40:44.833 --> 40:48.200
ONE BLACK LEAD BUT NO AFRO

40:48.266 --> 40:49.200
LATINX.

40:49.266 --> 40:50.700
THE COMMITTEE THAT MAKES NOTE OF

40:50.766 --> 40:52.766
EVERYONE'S SKIN TONE DISCOVERED

40:52.833 --> 40:53.566
THIS AND THEN LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA

40:53.633 --> 40:55.933
HAD TO SAY "I'M TRULY SORRY, I'M

40:56.000 --> 40:57.366
LEARNING FROM THE FEEDBACK.

40:57.433 --> 40:58.866
I THANK YOU FOR RAISING IT AND

40:58.933 --> 40:59.200
I'M LISTENING.

40:59.266 --> 41:02.000
I PROMISE TO DO BETTER IN MY

41:02.066 --> 41:02.400
FUTURE PROJECTS."

41:02.466 --> 41:04.866
THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT

41:04.933 --> 41:06.300
WITH NIKKI.

41:06.366 --> 41:07.300
PLEASE, STOP THE APOLOGIZING,

41:07.366 --> 41:09.200
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO MADE THE

41:09.266 --> 41:13.633
FOUNDING FATHERS BLACK AND

41:13.700 --> 41:14.300
HISPANIC, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE

41:14.366 --> 41:17.733
TO APOLOGIZE TO TWITTER.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.700
FOR FUCK SAKE!

41:20.766 --> 41:22.133
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE HATE

41:22.200 --> 41:22.400
DEMOCRATS.

41:22.466 --> 41:29.266
IT'S GR CRINGEY.

41:29.333 --> 41:30.466
>> THEY CAN'T DISTINGUISH

41:30.533 --> 41:31.566
BETWEEN AN OVERSIGHT AND AN

41:31.633 --> 41:32.766
OUTRAGE.

41:32.833 --> 41:35.200
LET ME HELP THEM -- AS A WHITE

41:35.266 --> 41:36.733
BOY I HAD TO LOOK THIS UP BUT IF

41:36.800 --> 41:38.466
YOU ARE A BLACK WOMAN GIVING

41:38.533 --> 41:40.533
BIRTH, YOU ARE FOUR TIMES MORE

41:40.600 --> 41:41.933
LIKELY TO DIE IN CHILDBIRTH AND

41:42.000 --> 41:42.500
A WHITE WOMAN.

41:42.566 --> 41:44.900
IF YOU'RE A BLACK KID YOUR TWO

41:44.966 --> 41:46.200
AND A HALF TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

41:46.266 --> 41:48.133
BE SHOT BY A COP THAN A WHITE

41:48.200 --> 41:48.300
KID.

41:48.366 --> 41:50.000
IF YOU HAPPEN TO SURVIVE THAT,

41:50.066 --> 41:51.000
YOU MAKE LESS MONEY, YOU HAVE

41:51.066 --> 41:53.166
LESS WEALTH AND YOU DIE SOONER,

41:53.233 --> 41:54.166
THOSE ARE OUTRAGES AND LIBERALS

41:54.233 --> 41:56.633
ARE TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT, NOT

41:56.700 --> 41:59.100
THE CASTING CHOICES OF I THINK A

41:59.166 --> 42:00.433
HERO LOOK A GUY WHO'S MAKING A

42:00.500 --> 42:05.700
FILM ABOUT A MINORITY COMMUNITY.

42:05.766 --> 42:10.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

42:10.800 --> 42:12.000
>> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

42:12.066 --> 42:15.533
I KIND OF WANT TO BE LIKE WHO IS

42:15.600 --> 42:16.166
MAD?

42:16.233 --> 42:17.633
WE NEED TO HAVE A DART BOARD TO

42:17.700 --> 42:20.300
IDENTIFY WHO IS MAD AND WHO MAY

42:20.366 --> 42:21.233
BE WITH A LITTLE CHART OR

42:21.300 --> 42:22.700
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DO

42:22.766 --> 42:25.100
THINK THESE ARE THE MOMENTS OF

42:25.166 --> 42:28.400
INDIVIDUAL THERAPEUTIC IDEAS AND

42:28.466 --> 42:29.966
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH

42:30.033 --> 42:34.900
BLACK MATERNAL MORTALITY, BUT IF

42:34.966 --> 42:35.900
WE GET AN APOLOGY FROM

42:35.966 --> 42:37.100
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA WE MIGHT FEEL

42:37.166 --> 42:38.633
BETTER BUT WE WON'T FEEL BETTER

42:38.700 --> 42:39.933
BECAUSE NOTHING WILL CHANGE, WE

42:40.000 --> 42:43.433
WILL DO THIS ALL AGAIN FOREVER.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.300
IN THE EARLY 90s, PEOPLE WERE

42:45.366 --> 42:46.800
MAD ABOUT SPIKE LEE MOVIES AND

42:46.866 --> 42:48.066
WE'VE BEEN MAD ABOUT THINGS

42:48.133 --> 42:54.966
FOREVER BECAUSE BEING MAD IS AN

42:55.033 --> 42:55.900
IRREPLACEABLE RESOURCE.

42:55.966 --> 42:57.166
WE WILL NEVER STOP BEING MAD

42:57.233 --> 42:57.733
ABOUT THINGS.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.300
I THINK IT'S TIME TO RECOGNIZE

42:59.366 --> 43:00.333
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE MAD ON

43:00.400 --> 43:01.533
THE INTERNET YOU NEED TO

43:01.600 --> 43:03.733
IDENTIFY WHO IS MAD, DO THEY

43:03.800 --> 43:04.466
VOTE?

43:04.533 --> 43:04.900
DO THEY HAVE POWER?

43:04.966 --> 43:06.966
TO THEY HAVE THE POWER TO VOTE

43:07.033 --> 43:09.266
ON THINGS THAT COULD CHANGE

43:09.333 --> 43:11.033
THESE REAL LIVED EXPERIENCES OF

43:11.100 --> 43:12.100
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR?

43:12.166 --> 43:14.766
IF THEY DON'T YOU'RE JUST KIND

43:14.833 --> 43:19.366
OF LIKE MEH.

43:19.433 --> 43:22.100
>> Bill: WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS

43:22.166 --> 43:23.566
PEOPLE USED TO GET MAD BUT

43:23.633 --> 43:24.400
PEOPLE DIDN'T USE TO GROVEL AND

43:24.466 --> 43:26.000
APOLOGIZE FOR IT, I THINK THAT

43:26.066 --> 43:27.466
IS DIFFERENT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA.

43:27.533 --> 43:31.066
I DIDN'T READ THE CRITICISMS OF

43:31.133 --> 43:33.300
THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE WORTHY TO

43:33.366 --> 43:34.633
READ, OBVIOUSLY HE FELT IT WAS

43:34.700 --> 43:36.466
IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO MAKE

43:36.533 --> 43:36.866
THIS APOLOGY.

43:36.933 --> 43:38.733
DO I THINK HE REALLY THINKS HE

43:38.800 --> 43:40.600
SHOULD APOLOGIZE?

43:40.666 --> 43:41.266
I DON'T.

43:41.333 --> 43:43.533
HE JUST WANTS TO AVOID THE NEWS

43:43.600 --> 43:43.733
CYCLE.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.366
I DON'T BLAME THEM, AT SOME

43:46.433 --> 43:48.133
POINT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE

43:48.200 --> 43:49.333
TO STAND UP TO THESE BULLIES,

43:49.400 --> 43:50.633
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

43:50.700 --> 43:51.700
IT'S JUST BULLYING.

43:51.766 --> 43:53.566
I CAN MAKE YOU CRAWL LIKE A DOG

43:53.633 --> 43:54.700

43:56.233 --> 44:01.366
MOVIE WITH A LATINO CAST, NOT

44:01.433 --> 44:02.533
GOOD ENOUGH, NOTHING IS EVER

44:02.600 --> 44:03.700
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THESE PEOPLE,

44:03.766 --> 44:05.300
THEY ARE LIKE CHILDREN, WE DON'T

44:05.366 --> 44:06.766
RAISE OUR CHILDREN RIGHT AND

44:06.833 --> 44:08.533
IT'S DEFLECTED IN THE MEDIA.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.100
NOBODY EVER TELLS THEIR CHILDREN

44:10.166 --> 44:11.466
SHUT THE FUCK UP, SIT DOWN,

44:11.533 --> 44:18.866

44:36.933 --> 44:39.366

45:52.966 --> 45:54.666
YOU WANT OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS WITH

45:54.733 --> 45:55.766
MONEY WHO WON'T COMPLAIN THAT

47:14.633 --> 47:16.466
SURELY, HONG KONG, YOU MUST KNOW

47:16.533 --> 47:19.066

47:50.400 --> 47:52.100
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

47:52.166 --> 47:53.766
IN A STORY I'M GETTING TIRED OF

47:53.833 --> 47:54.666
REPORTING, CALIFORNIA IS RUNNING

47:54.733 --> 47:57.500
OUT OF WATER, AND THIS TIME JUST

47:57.566 --> 48:06.766
WHEN WE STARTED SHOWERING AGAIN.

48:06.833 --> 48:07.766
19,000 ACRES OF FOREST HAVE

48:07.833 --> 48:10.133
ALREADY BURNED THIS YEAR, AND

48:10.200 --> 48:11.000
72% OF THE ENTIRE WEST IS IN

48:11.066 --> 48:14.300
SEVERE DROUGHT.

[LAUGHTER]

48:20.133 --> 48:21.133

48:21.200 --> 48:22.100
THE BAY AREA WAS JUST PLACED

UNDER A WATER SHORTAGE

48:23.333 --> 48:24.100
EMERGENCY, WITH MANDATORY

48:24.166 --> 48:27.100
RESTRICTIONS.

48:27.166 --> 48:28.666
EXCEPT HERE'S THE THING: THERE

48:28.733 --> 48:30.033
ISN'T, EVEN WITH THE DROUGHT,

48:30.100 --> 48:32.500
REALLY A WATER SHORTAGE PROBLEM

48:32.566 --> 48:34.200
- IT'S MORE A "WHERE THE WATER

48:34.266 --> 48:37.000
IS GOING" PROBLEM.

48:37.066 --> 48:39.500
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS

48:39.566 --> 48:41.633
FOR 80% OF OUR WATER USE EVEN

48:41.700 --> 48:43.466
THOUGH CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS

48:43.533 --> 48:45.700
LESS THAN 2% OF OUR ECONOMY.

48:45.766 --> 48:48.233
WE ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH WATER.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.333
WE JUST GIVE WAY TOO MUCH OF IT

48:50.400 --> 48:51.733
TO FARMERS, WHO GET THEIR WATER

48:51.800 --> 48:53.000
SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT,

48:53.066 --> 48:55.033
BECAUSE WE STILL ACT LIKE IT'S

48:55.100 --> 48:57.233
1890 AND FARMERS ARE SMALL AND

48:57.300 --> 48:58.500
INDEPENDENT, WHEN REALLY THEY'RE

49:10.700 --> 49:14.500
INCORPORATED.

49:14.566 --> 49:15.100
AND CORPORATIONS GET WHAT THEY

49:15.166 --> 49:17.766
WANT IN AMERICA.

49:17.833 --> 49:20.833
WE'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO DECADES

49:20.900 --> 49:22.500
IN PERPETUAL DROUGHT, YET ALMOND

49:22.566 --> 49:24.700
FARMS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DOUBLED

49:24.766 --> 49:26.933
IN THAT TIME - DESPITE THE FACT

49:27.000 --> 49:28.166
THAT ALMOND PRODUCTION ALONE

49:28.233 --> 49:29.433
USES MORE WATER THAN ALL THE

49:29.500 --> 49:31.033
HUMANS AND BUSINESSES OF SAN

49:31.100 --> 49:32.233
FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES

49:32.300 --> 49:34.033

49:50.266 --> 49:51.066
WATER IT TAKES TO GROW DIFFERENT

49:51.133 --> 49:53.366
CROPS: ORANGES, TOMATOES,

49:53.433 --> 49:55.166
STRAWBERRIES, ALL TAKE AROUND 11

49:55.233 --> 49:56.600
GALLONS TO MAKE ONE POUND.

49:56.666 --> 50:03.466
ALMONDS?

50:03.533 --> 50:04.200
1900 GALLONS.

50:04.266 --> 50:05.100
THAT WASN'T A PROBLEM BACK WHEN

50:05.166 --> 50:05.700
IT RAINED.

50:05.766 --> 50:06.500
BUT NOW THERE SIMPLY ISN'T

50:06.566 --> 50:07.900
ENOUGH WATER TO GO AROUND.

50:07.966 --> 50:09.733
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE A PAINFUL

50:09.800 --> 50:10.700
CHOICE: GETTING IT IN THE PEOPLE

50:10.766 --> 50:18.933
OR GETTING IT IN THE NUTS.

50:25.266 --> 50:26.266
ALMONDS - THEY'RE JUST NOT MORE

50:26.333 --> 50:27.466
IMPORTANT THAN THE ENTIRE

50:27.533 --> 50:30.966
ECOSYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA.

50:31.033 --> 50:32.866
SO WHEN I HEAR THAT OUR STATE

50:32.933 --> 50:35.233
GROWS 81% OF THE WHOLE WORLD'S

50:53.633 --> 50:55.600
THIS IS LIFE AND DEATH, AND

50:55.666 --> 50:57.833
ALMONDS ARE JUST NOT CRUCIAL.

50:57.900 --> 50:59.066
NO ONE HAS A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS

50:59.133 --> 51:00.300
"DON'T TALK TO ME UNTIL I'VE HAD

51:00.366 --> 51:05.133
MY ALMONDS."

DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT, AND AN

51:32.300 --> 51:33.533
OF WORK BECAUSE COAL IS KILLING

ALMOND FARMERS YOU CAN'T GROW
