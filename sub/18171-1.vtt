00:46.588 --> 00:50.259
Did you think we were
gonna be together forever?

00:54.805 --> 00:58.392
You know, you act
like such a little kid.

00:58.475 --> 01:02.521
Like, you're a little eight-year-old
runnin' around, bein' goofy.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.816
You know, I just
can't stand it anymore.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.901
What do you want me to say?

01:07.985 --> 01:10.445
Don't say nothin'.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.823
Can I say I'm sorry?

01:12.906 --> 01:16.451
It's too late.
Just don't say nothin'.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.163
Can I kiss you one last time?

01:23.959 --> 01:27.963
Tell me.
Tell me that you love me.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.844
Do you love me?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.452
They used to get around,

01:58.535 --> 02:01.330
walkin'around, lookin'at stuff.

02:10.214 --> 02:14.134
They used to try to find clues
to all the mysteries...

02:14.218 --> 02:17.179
and mistakes God had made.

02:44.081 --> 02:49.336
My friend George said that he
was gonna live to be 100 years old.

02:49.419 --> 02:55.175
"He said"... "He said that he was gonna be"
the president of the United States.

02:56.969 --> 03:02.140
I wanted to see him lead a parade
and wave a flag on the Fourth ofJuly.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.393
He just wanted greatness.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.735
The grown-ups in my town,

03:13.777 --> 03:16.780
they were never kids
like me and my friends.

03:20.826 --> 03:24.580
They had worked in wars
and built machines.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.583
It was hard for them
to find their peace.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.046
Don't you know how that feels?

04:34.358 --> 04:37.903
I like to go to beautiful places...

04:37.986 --> 04:41.281
where there's waterfalls
and empty fields.

04:41.365 --> 04:45.661
Just places that are nice
and calm and quiet.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.755
Come back here!

04:56.839 --> 04:58.882
You will not defeat me!

05:04.513 --> 05:07.766
- Hi, George.
- Hi.

05:07.850 --> 05:10.894
- What you doin'?
- Nothin'.

05:14.356 --> 05:18.944
You will die in the graveyard of...
You know what I mean.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.697
'Cause I am smooth!

05:27.786 --> 05:31.373
- Who's cat is that?
- This is Nancy the cat.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.127
I'm baby-sittin' her for my cousin.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.546
She's in Florida somewhere.

05:37.629 --> 05:41.550
So, why aren't you over there
with Vernon and them?

05:41.592 --> 05:43.594
My head hurts.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.013
Yeah, my legs hurt.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.394
I love you!
I love you!

05:52.436 --> 05:56.648
This is war!

06:00.110 --> 06:04.406
When I look at
my friends, I know there's goodness.

06:04.448 --> 06:08.869
I can look at their feet,
or when I hold their hands,

06:08.952 --> 06:11.914
I pretend I can see the bones inside.

06:41.318 --> 06:45.322
This place is falling apart
faster than we can do anything.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.408
You're supposed
to be a leader, Damascus.

06:48.492 --> 06:54.164
You oughta look around
and see the hazards.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.292
I'm holding you for a day's pay.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.337
You're holding me
for a day's pay? A day's pay?

07:00.379 --> 07:03.090
End of discussion.
I've got a train yard to run.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.093
That's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm talkin' about conditions.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.221
I'm talkin' about goin' home every
night and not coughing up blood.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.849
I'm talkin' about I got burns
on the back of my neck.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.060
I'm talkin' about animals
runnin' up, tearin' up track.

07:15.143 --> 07:20.482
What am I 'posed to do when
one of those dogs bite me, huh?

07:20.524 --> 07:23.986
Your workman's compensation
doesn't cover that, does it?

07:25.612 --> 07:28.323
Think about it,
Damascus. You're a good worker.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.910
Don't do anything you're gonna
regret six months from now.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.250
I'm thinkin' about it.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.360
The first time George
saw his dog,

08:05.444 --> 08:08.197
it was sittin'in some feces.

08:10.908 --> 08:14.828
It didn't have anywhere to go,
no one to love it.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.709
It couldn't do no harm but walk.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.847
Ears are nasty,
his head is nasty,

08:34.932 --> 08:38.309
his legs are nasty,
his tail's crooked.

08:38.393 --> 08:43.607
Get off me, man!
You play too much.

09:18.809 --> 09:23.772
Hey, Augie, now that Damascus quit,
I bet my dad makes you supervisor.

09:23.856 --> 09:27.651
- Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?
- Maybe you'll get a raise.
Hey, could I get a light?

09:27.734 --> 09:32.447
I am absolutely disgusted with
all of you. Completely disgusted.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.326
Look at what you eat for lunch.
Look at that. What is that?
That's preservatives.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.121
- "It's fudge."
- "Euless."

09:39.162 --> 09:41.748
- Nobody cares what you're saying.
- It causes cancer.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.793
- You're gay.
- I'm not gay. I have a wife, okay?

09:44.835 --> 09:47.796
It causes cancer. At least, if you're
gonna eat that, have some almonds.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.716
How do you deal with yourself?
When I go to the bathroom,

09:50.799 --> 09:52.718
I like to be proud of what happens.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.053
I like to be proud
of the whole experience.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.764
I like to know that it smells
sweet, not horrible.

09:57.848 --> 10:03.145
Hold up, hold up.
There are two hot dogs with chili
somewhere in my pant suit.

10:03.187 --> 10:06.064
Why are you always toting
that toothbrush around for?

10:06.148 --> 10:09.359
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you guys try some salad?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.821
- "I have a mixed salad in my bag."
- "Euless, I don't eat at all."

10:12.905 --> 10:15.991
- I don't eat at all.
- And you don't stretch
before you work, either.

10:16.074 --> 10:19.536
When I get a hankering for something
to eat, I chew it and spit it out.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.747
Know what I'm sayin'?

10:23.290 --> 10:27.336
Hey, there's those kids again.
They're trying to steal a car.

10:27.419 --> 10:31.089
No. Excuse me.
You'll not touch that. No.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.509
It's that crazy nigger,
Rico Rice.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.636
You just get off that bike.

10:35.719 --> 10:39.014
My dad's at lunch right now,
but you know what he said he'd do
if he caught you around here again.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.350
I'd like to see him try.

10:41.391 --> 10:45.103
Sonya, excuse me, but you're
already busted for stealin'
Nathan Worthin's car.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.689
If my pop comes out here
shootin' his machine gun,

10:47.773 --> 10:52.152
it ain't gonna be me goin' to federal
prison or sittin' in the electric chair.

10:52.236 --> 10:55.739
- "Shock!"
- This piece of junk ain't doin'
nothin' but sittin' in a ditch.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.200
Well, duh.
I gotta fix the damn thing.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.577
"Well, duh.
I gotta fix the damn thing."

11:00.661 --> 11:03.372
I believe it's on.

11:06.917 --> 11:10.629
Whoo! Now say that to my face,
playboy! Whoo! Burnt bacon!

11:12.381 --> 11:14.758
Come on, get it on!

11:14.842 --> 11:17.803
Break it, break it, break it.
Break it up. Break it up.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.305
- Come on, man!
- You'll get us all fired.

11:20.389 --> 11:24.142
Here's the story. Buddy, George
and Vernon, you can touch the bike.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.395
Sonya, you cannot.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.733
What's happening, Buddy?

11:31.817 --> 11:34.570
- How're you doin'?
Long time no see.
- Yeah.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.197
- How's your moms?
- She doin' all right.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.367
- Yeah?
- Still got trouble
gettin' to sleep at night.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.995
- That's tough, man.
- Yeah.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.790
- She's been through a lot, you know?
- Yeah, but she's okay.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.669
I just gotta sing to her
before she goes to bed at night.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.131
Otherwise, she can't get to sleep.

11:54.214 --> 11:59.678
Kinda stupid, but it don't
bother me. Makes me sleepy too.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.556
What kind of songs you sing to her?

12:02.639 --> 12:06.560
...she likes the theme
to "Blazing Saddles."

12:08.145 --> 12:11.273
- How's your pee?
- How's my what?

12:11.315 --> 12:13.734
Your pee. Your urine.
Is it clear?

12:15.819 --> 12:18.488
Good.
Means you're healthy.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.783
Cool.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.620
- Why are you tryin'
to get pregnant so bad?
- Who's gonna have a baby?

12:24.661 --> 12:27.623
I don't know. I guess
I just wanna be a baby's mama.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.625
- What about Darrian?
- Oh, child, please.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.002
He is too ugly
to be the father of my child.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.630
Let me tell you,
guys ain't nothin'.

12:34.713 --> 12:38.759
They break up with you,
then they beg you to get back,
and then they break up again.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.470
You should've just left them
alone the first time.

12:41.512 --> 12:45.098
I know. It's like if you don't wanna go
with a guy, and you break up with them,

12:45.182 --> 12:48.101
then they beg you to go back
so that they could break up with you.

12:48.185 --> 12:51.313
Then they can go tellin' their friends,
"Oh, yeah, I broke up with this girl."

12:51.355 --> 12:54.733
I don't understand why they go through
all that. They get on my nerves anyway.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.110
I mean, I swear,
my ex boyfriend makes me sick.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.364
He always wanted to argue.
He'd act childish. He's older than me.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.367
Y'all know y'all are not gonna
find nobody in this town...

13:03.450 --> 13:06.453
that's, that's even close
to bein' perfect.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.665
You all gotta get out, go travelin'.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.961
You see Nasia and George
at the park today talking?

13:14.044 --> 13:16.964
Yo, man, what's up with that, yo?

13:17.047 --> 13:20.467
She better not be tryin'
to hurt my feelings,

13:20.551 --> 13:23.470
and she better not
be hookin' up with him.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.974
Man, this is something
that girls do, man.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.435
They try to dump you and then
go with your best friend, yo.

13:30.519 --> 13:34.189
It's just Denise and all them
puttin' words in their head.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.359
She wouldn't be tryin' to talk to me,
yo, 'cause I wouldn't talk back to her.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.486
That's why she's
talkin' to George.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.698
I don't care about the other girls.
I care about Nasia.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.200
I think about her all the time.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.914
What's that?

13:54.251 --> 13:57.129
I dug this up
in the ground yesterday.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.756
Why you do that to it, man?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.634
I don't know. I was bored.

14:02.718 --> 14:06.847
Destructive kind, yo.
Cheer up, man.

14:40.464 --> 14:44.760
Hey, George. You know,
your Uncle D walked out on us today.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.387
That man's crazy.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.557
I swear, Rico's father thought
he was gonna have a conniption fit.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.560
I thought he was gonna bust.
What do you call it? A crazy move?

14:53.644 --> 14:56.647
Nothing shocks my dad, man.
That's why he's the boss,

14:56.730 --> 15:00.150
and that's why he just bought
a K-Car turbo, as in King Car Turbo.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.236
That's right.

15:02.319 --> 15:05.572
- That's a good-lookin' dog.
- He is a nice dog.
Where'd you get him at?

15:05.656 --> 15:07.908
I don't know.
I just found it.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.912
Yeah, I seen a dog like that on
television. Man, that's rare as crap.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.248
Smells like crap.

15:14.331 --> 15:17.626
Have you had that thing
checked out for a hysterectomy?

15:17.668 --> 15:20.629
I think it's got
halitosis or something.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.549
You should give it cold lima beans
with a little bit of salt.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.551
Anyways, are you
gonna keep that puppy?

15:25.634 --> 15:29.847
- No. My uncle won't let me keep a dog.
- Oh, that's right.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.851
Old Damascus would probably cut its head
off or somethin'. He's a crazy man.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.604
I remember this one time we were over at
Barry's house. He was havin' a cookout.

15:37.688 --> 15:40.357
And Barry's cat started
freakin' out, right?

15:40.440 --> 15:44.862
Like he was high, like he
was physically insane, right?

15:44.903 --> 15:48.240
And that cat starts pushin' over
people's drinks, you know,

15:48.323 --> 15:52.161
usin' the restroom everywhere,
and Damascus shows up, right?

15:52.244 --> 15:55.747
And he pulls a whip out
of his, out of his shorts.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.584
That cat runs to the left,
and he pops it to the left,

15:58.667 --> 16:01.336
then he runs to the right
and pops it to the right.

16:01.378 --> 16:05.174
And then he pops that cat like
right on the bridge of its nose,

16:05.215 --> 16:08.635
and that cat rolled over
and started shakin', right?

16:08.719 --> 16:12.347
And it was so gross,
it was like a...

16:12.431 --> 16:17.895
like a dead, old,
gross, dead... squirrel.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.731
Ohh. Excuse me for a second,
would you, please?

16:20.814 --> 16:24.526
I've just had my fruit cup. You're gonna make me vomit,
talkin' about dead squirrels.

16:24.568 --> 16:27.029
No, this...
This is little Bobby.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.406
No, that's
little Bobby's cousin.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.742
- Oh, it's just Richard.
- That ain't no Richard.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.994
- It's Richard.
- Richard might be his middle name.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.455
- It is too Richard.
Look, it's on the back.
- You don't know him.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.999
- Girl, no.
- It's written on the back
of the picture.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.293
Why do you let them
come over here?

16:41.376 --> 16:43.921
Because you know without me
you won't know about things.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.715
Oh, and here comes Vernon.
Look at Vernon.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.551
- Please.
- That boy live here?

16:49.593 --> 16:52.763
- Come in.
- Hey, Vernon, baby, how're you doin'?

16:52.846 --> 16:54.973
- Lookin' good today.
- What's up, y'all?

16:55.057 --> 16:57.100
All you all looking good too.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.187
I know I look good.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.314
Hey, can I speak to Nasia?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.316
No, you don't.

17:04.398 --> 17:07.402
Nasia. Anything you got to say
to her, you can say it to all of us.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.780
- Thank you.
- Shut up. I don't like you anyway.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.491
- No way.
- You don't come in here with that.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.993
You don't come up in my house, dissin'
my friends. What is your function?

17:16.078 --> 17:19.455
- I'm just playin', Nasia.
- What's up with your brother?
Why he ain't call me?

17:19.540 --> 17:22.416
Your brother. What's up with him?

17:22.501 --> 17:25.127
Girl, Denise told me
he ain't had no muscles.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.297
What do you want?

17:27.381 --> 17:30.384
I want to know what's up
with you and Buddy?

17:30.467 --> 17:33.512
What do you mean?
I mean...

17:33.595 --> 17:36.723
You ain't been callin'
him or nothin', man. He told me.

17:36.807 --> 17:40.060
- He said y'all don't even talk no more.
- Yeah, 'cause we broke up.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.647
- Broke up? For what?
- Because he acts too much
like a little kid.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.942
I'm looking
for a more mature person.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.237
Man, he 13, you 12.
Y'all both little kids.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.906
What else y'all
supposed to act like?

17:52.990 --> 17:55.200
He's supposed to act more mature.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.619
But you know what?
I found somebody better.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.621
- Who?
- George.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.708
George?
George is stupid.

18:02.791 --> 18:05.627
His skull ain't even
fused together, man.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.671
He can't even take baths.
He stink.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.756
He wear the same jeans every day.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.177
He don't even talk, man. I think
something wrong with that boy for real.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.264
You know what? This is not
even your problem. Why...

18:17.347 --> 18:19.600
- It is my problem.
- No, it's not.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.769
Yes, it is, because Buddy is like
my little brother, all right?

18:22.853 --> 18:24.897
And I'm just tryin'
to look out for him.

18:24.980 --> 18:29.568
You his first girlfriend.
This is comin' from my heart
right here, you know?

18:29.651 --> 18:33.030
You just tryin' to act like your sister
or somethin', tryin' to be fast.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.407
- "What's wrong with you?"
- You know what?

18:35.490 --> 18:37.659
I don't really care
what you think.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.245
I mean, I like Buddy
up to a certain point.

18:40.329 --> 18:43.832
But you know what? He acts
too much like a little kid,
so I found somebody else.

18:43.916 --> 18:47.336
I don't want him goin' around
goin' crazy because some stupid
little girl dumped him.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.005
I just wanna know why
you two... why you trippin'.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.843
Because he's too young.
Case closed.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.763
I've got people waitin' for me,
so I'll talk to you later.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.765
All right, whatever.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.893
George knew
if his uncle found his dog...

19:44.935 --> 19:46.895
he'd end up killing it...

19:46.937 --> 19:49.773
"'cause he was always killin'stuff"...

19:49.857 --> 19:53.110
bangin'on things and makin'traps.

19:55.779 --> 20:00.325
The dog was very old and lazy...

20:00.409 --> 20:02.369
and just ugly...

20:02.452 --> 20:04.496
but George still loved it.

20:04.580 --> 20:08.584
"It had bumps."
I mean, not bumps.

20:08.667 --> 20:12.713
More like bugs and fleas and ticks.

20:12.796 --> 20:17.092
All kinds of pests,
like, all over its legs.

20:22.931 --> 20:26.018
That I were
as in the months of old,

20:26.101 --> 20:29.438
as in the days
when God watched over me:

20:29.479 --> 20:31.982
When His lamp
shone over my head...

20:32.065 --> 20:35.360
and by His light
I walked through darkness:

20:35.444 --> 20:37.905
When I was in my prime:

20:37.988 --> 20:41.617
When the friendship of God
was upon my tent:

20:41.700 --> 20:44.036
When the Almighty was with me:

20:44.119 --> 20:46.747
When my children were around me:

20:51.668 --> 20:53.879
When my steps
were washed with milk...

20:53.962 --> 20:57.925
and the rock poured out
for me streams of oil.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.892
Hey, is that the Bible
or Shakespeare?

21:11.647 --> 21:15.567
"I mean, they"...
Yes, there are nice people here.

21:15.651 --> 21:19.279
It's a nice town. I mean, it's
like any other place, I guess.

21:19.363 --> 21:23.992
But it's got its good parts, and
then on the other side of the coin,

21:24.034 --> 21:26.537
there are the bad parts too.

21:26.620 --> 21:31.542
But it's really too bad you can't see
the stars on account of all the smoke.

21:31.625 --> 21:35.003
Man, you know what? My room
ain't got no windows anyway.

21:42.052 --> 21:46.014
Hey, man, are you still hanging
out with that girl Nasia?

21:46.098 --> 21:50.352
No, man. She dumped me
last week at church.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.980
What?

21:53.063 --> 21:55.315
- Geez.
- For my friend George Richardson.

21:55.399 --> 21:58.360
It's kind of stupid, though. I mean...

21:58.402 --> 22:01.029
I gave my all to her.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.324
I mean, a plastic ring
and a kiss.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.577
I mean, it's the thought
that counts.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.996
George...
I mean, he's all right.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.957
I mean, if somebody had
to dump you for somebody else,

22:12.040 --> 22:14.918
George is probably a three
on a one-to-ten scale.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.047
I miss having her around,

22:19.131 --> 22:22.426
bein' able to talk to her
about my feelings and stuff.

22:24.428 --> 22:28.515
I mean... she had
this glaze in her eyes.

22:28.599 --> 22:31.810
Just made me tingle all over.

22:38.442 --> 22:42.196
It's like that one time
I dated this white girl.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.865
And everything was going good.
You know what I mean?

22:44.948 --> 22:47.075
Like, everything was cool.

22:47.117 --> 22:50.120
And all of a sudden, for no...
for no reason,

22:50.162 --> 22:53.749
she dumped me for this dude
who was poor, fat and ugly.

22:53.790 --> 22:58.086
And it's just like you said. It's like
I was lookin' at myself, like, man!

22:58.170 --> 23:01.340
You know, and it just made you
feel like crap, man.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.425
Like real crap.

23:07.971 --> 23:12.184
Now the only women I even like
are my mom's friends.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.728
Your mom's friends?

23:14.811 --> 23:18.273
- "Yeah."
- Hey, man, play your own game.

23:18.357 --> 23:22.152
I just hope they're better lookin'
than my mom's friends...

23:22.236 --> 23:26.156
all drunk and raisin' hell
every night of the week.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.828
I mean,
my mom's friends are fine.

23:32.538 --> 23:35.582
Man, my mom's all right, though.
I mean, she's a handsome woman,

23:35.666 --> 23:39.127
and I'd say
she's almost perfect.

23:40.587 --> 23:43.340
She's, like, just super nice.
You know what I mean?

23:43.423 --> 23:46.176
She'll knit you a sweater
if you even shiver.

23:46.260 --> 23:49.388
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.539
Hey, Aunt Ruth.

24:57.623 --> 25:00.959
Why don't Uncle Damascus
like animals?

25:01.043 --> 25:05.047
He just don't like 'em, George.
They bother him.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.841
Does he like lions, even?

25:07.925 --> 25:10.427
I never asked him.

25:10.511 --> 25:14.890
What about chickens?
Does he like them?

25:14.973 --> 25:17.142
He'd like to eat 'em.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.812
Does he like dogs?

25:25.108 --> 25:27.027
Why not?

25:29.613 --> 25:32.324
He just don't like
to be bothered by them.

25:46.463 --> 25:50.509
George had to be
very careful never to get his head wet.

25:50.592 --> 25:55.430
See, his fontanel
was very, very, very, very soft.

25:55.514 --> 25:57.766
Like a baby's head.

25:57.850 --> 26:00.435
And when he soaks it or itches it,

26:00.519 --> 26:02.437
it irritates his brain.

26:05.816 --> 26:10.737
He don't like it, 'cause if somebody
hit him in his head, he'd probably die.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.124
Stop playin'!

26:26.461 --> 26:30.591
Do you remember the first time
we made love to this song?

26:30.674 --> 26:33.594
We were out in that field.

26:33.677 --> 26:36.555
You buried me in that grass.

26:38.348 --> 26:43.145
Why is it that every time you start talkin',
you sound like you're gonna cry?

26:51.195 --> 26:54.990
- I miss Momma.
- You didn't even know Momma.

26:55.073 --> 26:58.118
So, did she love me?

26:58.202 --> 27:00.662
Not as much as she loved me.

27:00.704 --> 27:02.789
Why not?

27:02.873 --> 27:05.000
'Cause you couldn't do
the funny dance.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.211
I can too.

27:07.294 --> 27:11.673
Well, you can now. Back then,
you was only one years old.

27:11.715 --> 27:14.218
You couldn't even stand up straight.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.929
We used to call you Turkey Legs.

27:21.642 --> 27:23.685
Good night, Whitney.

27:33.403 --> 27:36.740
If ever you're afraid

27:36.824 --> 27:40.536
Don't feel all alone

27:40.577 --> 27:44.164
The Holy Spirit's watching you

27:44.248 --> 27:47.918
Hey, Buddy,
you ever been baptized?

27:48.001 --> 27:52.214
No, man. I ain't
into that kind of stuff.

27:52.297 --> 27:56.593
The Holy Spirit is ever so near

27:56.677 --> 28:00.556
He will always hear you

28:00.639 --> 28:02.891
When you pray

28:02.975 --> 28:06.353
George, you like Nasia, man?

28:09.147 --> 28:12.192
I saw you two talkin' the other day.

28:12.276 --> 28:16.280
Man, we was just talkin'.
That's it. Nothin' more.

28:16.363 --> 28:20.284
- We still cool, right, though?
- Yeah, man.

28:20.367 --> 28:24.705
Whenever you will go away

28:24.788 --> 28:32.296
He will always stay

28:45.809 --> 28:48.020
Dunk man!

28:48.103 --> 28:50.022
Help me!

29:08.373 --> 29:10.918
Come here, boy!

29:42.699 --> 29:44.660
I'm Tyler.

29:46.537 --> 29:50.123
I can hold my breath
for six minutes.

29:50.207 --> 29:52.835
I got T.M.J.'s disease.

29:52.918 --> 29:56.296
- What's that?
- It's a jaw problem.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.674
How you get that neck brace?

29:58.715 --> 30:02.261
I was trying to do a 360 on my
skateboard, and I ran into a wall.

30:02.344 --> 30:06.682
Shut up! I saw you over there
talkin' to them Mexican girls, man.

30:06.765 --> 30:09.309
You little punk,
you can't skateboard.

30:09.393 --> 30:11.937
- Marco!
- Polo!

30:12.020 --> 30:16.358
Shut up! You ain't even playin'.
What's wrong with you, man?

30:16.400 --> 30:19.486
Man, I saw you bust today.
You can't even swim.

30:19.570 --> 30:22.322
Talkin' about you can swim,
but you can't even swim.

30:22.406 --> 30:25.159
- I bet you can't swim.
- I swim better than you!

30:25.242 --> 30:28.287
- You can't!
- Can't none of y'all swim.

30:28.370 --> 30:31.540
I saw all of y'all bustin',
doin' belly flops on the diving board.

30:31.623 --> 30:34.376
- You can't swim, neither.
- I saw you doin' belly flops.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.753
- You can't even swim.
- I had to get out of the water.
You was gonna drown me.

30:36.837 --> 30:41.008
Man, you're crazy, man.
I be flippin' off old ladies'
heads, off buildings...

30:41.091 --> 30:44.469
- Can you do a one-and-a-half?
Can you do a one-and-a-half?
- Huh?

30:44.553 --> 30:46.513
All right, see, that's my case.

30:46.597 --> 30:49.808
- I can do a one-and-a-half,
but you can't.
- Man, get out of here.

30:49.892 --> 30:54.229
- "One-and-a-half is a flip."
- Man, y'all gotta see this cat
head when he get in the water.

30:54.271 --> 30:57.858
His head starts swelling up.
His gums start bleeding, yo.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.527
You know them little...
What you call this?

31:00.611 --> 31:02.905
- Little dinosaurs you put
in the water, they swell up.
- Yeah.

31:02.946 --> 31:06.450
Yeah, that's what he look like when
he get in the water. He like a sponge.

31:06.533 --> 31:09.244
It's a damn shame!

31:09.286 --> 31:12.247
- Come on, y'all.
Let's get out of here.
- Come on.

31:12.289 --> 31:15.834
- "All right, bro."
- Man, what's wrong
with your little brother?

31:15.918 --> 31:18.378
What's wrong with you?

31:28.472 --> 31:32.434
Man, you know what I want?
I want some "ah-cream."

31:32.518 --> 31:35.562
Man, enunciate
your words, man. Pronounce.

31:35.646 --> 31:37.981
Ice cream?
Is that what you said?

31:38.065 --> 31:39.775
Ice cream.

31:39.858 --> 31:43.695
Big money, baby.
I need a new pair of shoes.

31:43.779 --> 31:46.824
I really need
a new pair of shoes.

31:46.907 --> 31:49.284
Come on, big money!

31:49.326 --> 31:52.371
Hah, y'all sad and blue now,
ain't ya?

31:52.454 --> 31:55.249
- "Hey, George! Check this out."
- "Don't do that."

31:55.332 --> 31:59.253
Y'all pitiful about it, ain't ya?

31:59.336 --> 32:03.298
Well, look at you! You still tryin'
to get a decent woman.

32:03.382 --> 32:08.178
- At least I had one.
- Hey, man, she weren't
that decent if she dumped you.

32:08.262 --> 32:12.349
- "Yeah."
- "Man, I gotta use the bathroom, man."

32:12.432 --> 32:14.560
"Pee."

32:14.643 --> 32:17.521
Who cares what you gotta do?
Don't tell the whole world.

32:17.604 --> 32:21.942
Man, look at this place, man. Look like
a... two tornadoes came through here.

32:22.025 --> 32:27.406
It even looks worse than my mom's, my
mom's yard, man, 'cause we don't mow it.

32:27.489 --> 32:29.992
It even looks
worse than that, man.

32:30.075 --> 32:32.619
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your mom?

32:32.703 --> 32:36.915
Well... she just got a hard time
gettin' to sleep at night.

32:36.999 --> 32:40.335
- That's all that is.
- I heard you gotta
sing to her and stuff, man.

32:40.419 --> 32:43.839
Yeah. But that's
none of your business.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.469
How'd you get here so fast?
I'll have to beat you up, man.

32:49.511 --> 32:53.140
Shut up, punk. Bring it here.
I'll... Come here. Hold on.

32:53.223 --> 32:57.603
What? Bring it on, baby.
Come on, baby!

32:57.686 --> 32:59.855
Smooth.

32:59.938 --> 33:03.609
Quit it! Come on!

33:03.692 --> 33:06.069
Stop it! Put me down!

33:06.153 --> 33:09.573
You about to cry, boy?

33:12.993 --> 33:16.538
Sonya, quit playing
with that doo-doo, girl.

33:16.622 --> 33:19.791
Sonya, put that doo-doo
down, girl.

33:19.875 --> 33:23.003
Sonya, quit playing
with that doo-doo, man,

33:23.086 --> 33:27.090
'cause I swear to God if you get
any on me, I'm gonna beat you down.

33:27.174 --> 33:30.802
God dog, Sonya, you gotta be
the dumbest person in captivity.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.896
Great. You broke my nose.

33:40.938 --> 33:44.608
Good. Maybe you won't be goin'
around throwin' doo-doo on people.

33:44.691 --> 33:49.571
God, y'all
stupid, man. I love every one of ya.

33:49.655 --> 33:52.366
See? Now it looks like gravy.

33:52.449 --> 33:56.411
Man, shut up, man! Don't ever
talk to me or touch me again.

33:59.915 --> 34:05.587
Yo, George, I got my wrestlin'
uniform in the mail yesterday.

34:05.629 --> 34:08.422
Kinda cool, huh?

34:11.217 --> 34:13.262
It's too big, man.

34:13.344 --> 34:17.349
It's like I could fit both
of my legs through one leg hole.

34:17.431 --> 34:21.812
"I gotta take a leak, man."

34:33.614 --> 34:35.534
What's up?

34:35.617 --> 34:39.788
Hey, George, guess what,
"man. This Korean dude yesterday"...

34:39.871 --> 34:43.500
He told me this joke. What do you call
something that's brown and sticky?

34:43.583 --> 34:45.585
- What?
- A stick.

34:45.627 --> 34:49.297
- Man, that's the dumbest joke.
- Man, hell no!

34:49.339 --> 34:53.010
Open up!

34:56.597 --> 34:59.308
Not my nuts, man!

34:59.391 --> 35:02.394
Gettin'out of shape.
Are you gay?

35:10.360 --> 35:13.113
When I break your heart,
I'll break your bones.

35:13.197 --> 35:16.450
Everybody knows that,
'cause I am Buddy.

35:16.533 --> 35:19.828
Man, hell no. My hand fell
in some piss. That ain't fair.

35:19.870 --> 35:22.039
Yes, it is. Oh, God!

35:34.635 --> 35:37.012
Help me, dude!

35:43.227 --> 35:45.521
Let go of me!

35:45.562 --> 35:48.857
God, man!
You act so retarded.

35:52.152 --> 35:56.114
Man, I didn't mean to do that.

35:56.198 --> 35:59.117
Are you all right, man?

35:59.201 --> 36:02.955
George, stay back, man.
George, come on, man.

36:03.038 --> 36:05.707
I didn't mean to mess up
your head like that.

36:17.678 --> 36:20.764
Buddy? Get up, man.

36:24.601 --> 36:27.354
Man, you bumped
your head hard.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.898
You all right?

36:29.982 --> 36:33.235
Man, I think I'll be all right.
This was my fault, man.

36:33.318 --> 36:36.238
Man, George went crazy
with you, man.

36:36.321 --> 36:38.866
I ain't never seen him
do like that before.

36:38.949 --> 36:42.244
You ought to be a boxer
or somethin', George.

36:42.286 --> 36:47.207
- You all right, man?
- Man, someone call my mom.

36:47.291 --> 36:50.252
Man, someone get a towel.
I'm gonna wipe up this water.

36:50.294 --> 36:53.005
George, man, what's wrong
with you? You crazy?

36:53.088 --> 36:58.260
I never seen you do like that.
You didn't have to hurt him like that.

36:58.302 --> 37:01.805
- Man, you're twice as big as he is.
- We was all just playing.

37:01.889 --> 37:05.100
Weren't we, Sonya?

37:08.437 --> 37:11.106
Buddy, what's wrong
with you, man?

37:11.148 --> 37:13.984
What's up, man?

37:20.741 --> 37:22.784
He's bleeding.

37:27.164 --> 37:29.124
Buddy.

38:18.882 --> 38:23.011
Oh, man! We gotta think.
This is private property, man.

38:23.095 --> 38:26.807
We gotta get him, man.
We can't just leave him here.

38:26.849 --> 38:29.518
We can't...
We gotta get him, man.

38:29.560 --> 38:33.230
If we leave him here, man,
somebody gonna find out.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.816
Man, if my dad found out, man...

38:35.858 --> 38:38.360
- This is the worst!
- How will they know it's us?

38:38.402 --> 38:40.863
Hey, shut up!

38:40.946 --> 38:43.407
You're so stupid!

38:44.741 --> 38:49.705
Man, it was stupid, man.
It was. It was stupid, man.

38:49.746 --> 38:53.083
That's my boy.

39:05.012 --> 39:07.347
I killed him.

39:07.431 --> 39:10.642
I grabbed his head.
I pushed him.

39:10.726 --> 39:13.020
It's my fault he's dead.

39:13.061 --> 39:15.689
I killed him.

41:56.266 --> 41:58.560
Get that spider off him.

42:00.103 --> 42:03.732
Ain't nobody gonna find you here,
Buddy. Don't nobody come here.

42:56.118 --> 42:58.620
What do you feed that dog?

42:58.662 --> 43:00.622
Gummy Bears.

43:00.664 --> 43:03.292
What else?

43:03.375 --> 43:06.295
Sometimes syrup on a bagel.

43:06.378 --> 43:10.174
See, that's why that dog
is so doggone skinny.

43:10.257 --> 43:13.969
You don't feed it enough.
Just nothin' but junk.

43:14.011 --> 43:18.015
You need to go and find him
some real dog food.

43:18.098 --> 43:21.685
This is real dog food.
The dog's eating it.

43:21.768 --> 43:24.980
- Come on.
- Don't look like it to me.
It's mostly on the ground.

43:25.063 --> 43:27.816
Hey, Rob, are you gonna
go to that union meeting tonight?

43:27.900 --> 43:30.152
I don't like that job.
I've been there 14 years.

43:30.194 --> 43:33.780
All I'm sayin' is, they might want
you down there for a little support.

43:33.864 --> 43:36.867
Rico, he has put in
a bunch of money down there.

43:39.495 --> 43:41.955
- I'm workin' there
just the same as he is.
- I don't care!

43:42.039 --> 43:45.250
- Go on down the road. Leave him alone.
- Nice workin' with you, man.

43:45.334 --> 43:47.836
- Hey, take it easy.
- Bye!

44:32.214 --> 44:36.677
What's that dog's name?
Or do you just call it Dog?

44:36.718 --> 44:39.596
My friend Vernon
calls it the Flash.

44:39.680 --> 44:44.893
I don't like that name, though.
It gets on my nerve.

44:44.935 --> 44:47.729
I hate that name.
It's too goofy.

45:47.289 --> 45:52.169
I think Buddy ran away 'cause
he still has a crush on me.

46:21.198 --> 46:23.158
You have nice hands.

46:41.009 --> 46:44.137
Some men came by
my house last night.

46:45.889 --> 46:48.725
Man, people have been talking.

46:51.895 --> 46:54.439
What'd they say?

46:56.233 --> 46:59.486
They wanted to know when
the last time I seen Buddy was.

47:01.780 --> 47:05.200
Man, I can't do this.

47:05.284 --> 47:09.830
I heard about the penitentiary, man.
I can't do that.

47:09.872 --> 47:13.125
You didn't do nothin'
on purpose, Vernon.

47:15.878 --> 47:18.547
Don't nobody care about that.

47:18.630 --> 47:22.426
All I know is, I can't do it.

47:22.509 --> 47:24.428
And, man...

47:31.685 --> 47:34.479
I just, I just want out of this.
All my life...

47:34.563 --> 47:37.065
It's like I can't trust
nobody, man.

47:37.149 --> 47:39.818
All my life,
people have let me down.

47:41.403 --> 47:46.116
I just want to be by myself
and just think about this...

47:46.200 --> 47:48.577
and think about what I'm gonna do.

47:48.619 --> 47:51.205
'Cause I know
I ain't stayin' around here.

47:51.246 --> 47:53.707
I just wish I had
my own tropical island.

47:53.749 --> 47:56.793
I wish I was...
I wish I could go to China.

47:56.877 --> 47:59.129
I wish I could go
to outer space, man.

47:59.213 --> 48:01.798
I wish I had my... own planet.

48:01.882 --> 48:06.220
I wish... I wish there
were 200 of me, man.

48:06.261 --> 48:09.306
I wish... I wish
I could just sit around...

48:09.389 --> 48:14.311
with computers and machines
and just brainstorm all day, man.

48:17.105 --> 48:19.483
I don't...
Man, I wish I was born again.

48:19.566 --> 48:22.528
I wish I could get saved
and give my life to Christ.

48:22.611 --> 48:26.949
Then maybe He'll forgive me
for what I did.

48:26.990 --> 48:30.285
Man, and you... It's like you
don't even show no emotion, man.

48:30.369 --> 48:33.413
It's like you don't even care
if Buddy's dead.

48:33.497 --> 48:36.250
I don't understand you, man.

48:38.043 --> 48:41.213
Man, I just wish there was
one belief... my belief.

49:40.189 --> 49:43.400
When you walk
around with no one to laugh with you...

49:43.484 --> 49:47.696
or to hold your hand, it's
a different kind of walk, you know?

50:01.793 --> 50:05.380
I would have never even thought
of the truth that George knew.

50:11.678 --> 50:16.808
I seen through your skin
"and seen the words"...

50:16.892 --> 50:20.938
the things you done,
the chances you missed,

50:21.021 --> 50:23.649
the loss of all things.

52:26.188 --> 52:29.316
Soon as the swelling goes down,
I think he's gonna be okay.

52:29.358 --> 52:32.736
Keep the ice on it for another
15 minutes after he wakes up.

52:34.446 --> 52:38.033
Just like when you went
and got baptized in the lake.

52:38.116 --> 52:40.536
That was stupid.
Are you stupid?

52:43.372 --> 52:46.208
I just wanted to save that boy.

52:46.250 --> 52:49.086
You make me sick
sometimes. You know that?

52:56.927 --> 53:01.640
See, my first kiss was...
in the sixth grade.

53:01.723 --> 53:04.184
It was with this boy Dimario.

53:04.226 --> 53:09.022
He... We had been going out
for maybe two weeks.

53:09.064 --> 53:12.526
- Two weeks?
- I mean, we had pop kissed
before then...

53:12.568 --> 53:14.778
Pop kissed?

53:14.862 --> 53:18.198
- But it wasn't like a French
until about two weeks after.
- A French?

53:18.240 --> 53:21.201
You stuck your tongue in somebody's
mouth after two weeks?

53:21.243 --> 53:24.204
- Yes, I did, okay?
- I don't know how to handle this.

53:24.246 --> 53:27.332
- You are too young to be doin' that.
- Anyway, back to my story.

53:27.416 --> 53:29.334
Okay. Sorry. Go ahead.

53:29.418 --> 53:32.796
Anyway, it was after school,
and my friend Latrice,

53:32.880 --> 53:36.800
she was like, "Oh, y'all need to kiss,
y'all need to kiss, and I wanna see it."

53:36.884 --> 53:39.261
And I was like,
"Latrice, no, you can't."

53:39.344 --> 53:44.141
And then we went outside, away from
the candy store where we were standing.

53:44.224 --> 53:46.810
We went outside in the courtyard.

53:46.894 --> 53:49.229
- And he kissed me.
- Outside in the courtyard?

53:49.271 --> 53:53.108
- I gotta watch you after school, outside in the courtyard.
- Oh, goodness, please.

54:10.167 --> 54:13.337
Is this the home
of George Richardson?

54:15.130 --> 54:18.217
I'm sorry. He's in bed.

54:19.635 --> 54:21.553
My name is Pamela Hurst.

54:21.637 --> 54:25.682
Your son saved
my son Tyler's life today.

54:25.766 --> 54:28.936
Yeah, we all had a hard day today.

54:28.977 --> 54:32.397
I understand there were
some complications.

54:32.481 --> 54:35.818
Yes, George is not supposed
to go in the swimming pool.

54:35.901 --> 54:40.656
His head is very sensitive,
and he's not feelin' very well.

54:40.739 --> 54:44.660
Your son is a hero,
Mrs. Richardson.

54:44.743 --> 54:49.498
George is not my son.
He's my nephew.

54:51.875 --> 54:54.670
I almost lost my son today.

54:54.753 --> 54:57.172
I appreciate you comin' by.

55:01.677 --> 55:04.179
I remember a time
I kissed somebody.

55:04.263 --> 55:07.182
I kissed him on the steps.
His name was Charles.

55:07.224 --> 55:09.768
I cannot believe I kissed him.
I just started goin' out with him...

55:09.852 --> 55:12.646
like five minutes before I kissed him.

55:12.688 --> 55:14.773
You're fast, man.

55:14.857 --> 55:17.484
And next thing,
we was on the steps kissin'.

55:17.568 --> 55:19.862
Lord, your cousin
reacted really crazy.

55:19.903 --> 55:22.531
She spit out her soda.
It was terrible.

55:22.614 --> 55:26.160
- She was laughin' at you.
- Yes, then we saw each other
later on that night,

55:26.243 --> 55:29.204
and all we did was kiss,
kiss, kiss, kiss.

55:29.246 --> 55:32.249
That's probably why I don't
like kissin' anymore now.

55:32.332 --> 55:35.586
If somebody
stuck their tongue in my mouth,
I'll have a heart attack. I swear.

55:35.669 --> 55:37.588
I can't stand that.

55:37.671 --> 55:41.466
"Duh Da Nuh Na, a new kind of hero.

55:41.550 --> 55:44.970
"George Richardson,
a 12-year-old New Street resident,

55:45.053 --> 55:48.724
"saved the life of an unidentified
eight-year-old boy yesterday afternoon.

55:48.807 --> 55:53.187
"The youngster had fallen
into the water at the New Main
Street public swimming pool...

55:53.228 --> 55:57.858
"while his mother was having a picnic
with friends at the nearby playground.

55:57.941 --> 56:02.029
"'Carelessness,' the mother blamed.
'It's my own fault.

56:02.070 --> 56:06.241
"'Thank God for giving George
the courage and strength
to be such a hero.

56:06.325 --> 56:09.077
He will always stand in my heart."'

56:09.119 --> 56:13.248
Why'd they put that picture
of me in my drawers?

56:13.332 --> 56:16.418
That's what you were wearing
when they found you.

56:16.502 --> 56:20.255
Oh, yeah. I didn't
want to get my pants wet.

56:20.339 --> 56:23.634
Don't worry about it, baby.
You're the hero.

56:23.717 --> 56:26.261
They'll get your picture
done right one day.

56:32.267 --> 56:35.896
What does the term
"a rolling stone gathers no moss"mean?

56:39.107 --> 56:41.193
If you start something, finish it,

56:41.276 --> 56:44.112
otherwise you'll never
accomplish anything.

56:46.323 --> 56:49.576
- I don't know.
- "Has your life ever been in danger?"

56:49.618 --> 56:52.037
No, ma'am.

56:52.120 --> 56:55.791
One time, my brother got my hand
caught in a bear trap.

56:55.833 --> 56:59.461
There was gushing...
Blood was gushing everywhere,

56:59.545 --> 57:04.299
and we couldn't go to the hospital
'cause we didn't have the money.

57:04.341 --> 57:06.844
So we tried some tape.

57:06.927 --> 57:09.429
When was the last time
you saw Buddy?

57:09.471 --> 57:13.433
About two days
after he disappeared...

57:13.475 --> 57:15.644
before he disappeared, I mean.

57:15.727 --> 57:17.646
And what did he say?

57:17.729 --> 57:20.607
I haven't seen Buddy
in almost six months.

57:20.649 --> 57:23.986
What was the last thing
he said to you?

57:24.069 --> 57:27.573
He said, "See you later, man."

57:29.158 --> 57:33.495
I broke up with Buddy because
I fell in love with another man.

57:56.185 --> 57:59.062
Hey, Daddy,
can I say something?

58:01.982 --> 58:05.652
"I just want to say that"...

58:05.694 --> 58:09.448
You remember when you told me
what happened was an accident,

58:09.531 --> 58:11.617
and I didn't believe you?

58:14.578 --> 58:16.914
Well, I do now.

58:22.878 --> 58:27.299
And I, I love you.

58:27.382 --> 58:31.845
I love you so much,
sometimes I can't even breathe.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:18.243
Hey, you wanna get
outta here one weekend?

01:00:18.327 --> 01:00:20.329
You wanna leave?

01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:22.956
You need to get a new shirt.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.225
Baby, you smell funky.

01:00:41.308 --> 01:00:44.603
You smell good.

01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:48.065
They found Buddy in a peaceful place.

01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:52.027
The water washed... his hands.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:27.437
Hi. This is Nasia.
You can talk.

01:01:29.356 --> 01:01:32.943
I don't feel good.
What time is it?

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.945
How's your head?

01:01:35.028 --> 01:01:38.323
I don't know.
It's my stomach.

01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:40.325
You wanna come over
to my house?

01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:43.078
- I wanna see you.
- No.

01:01:43.162 --> 01:01:45.455
I don't think
we should talk anymore.

01:01:45.539 --> 01:01:47.166
Why not?

01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:50.961
I just ain't got nothin' to say.

01:01:57.551 --> 01:02:00.637
George always knew he'd be a hero.

01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:03.432
It's like something
he can sense.

01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:06.018
He can tell
when somebody's in trouble,

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:10.939
so he's, like, always there,
"trying to help out however he can"...

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.111
walkin'old ladies
across the street,

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:19.239
teaching kids stuff so they
can walk across the street.

01:02:25.537 --> 01:02:28.999
One time, George saw a dead man
sittin'in a ditch...

01:02:29.082 --> 01:02:31.502
and he brought him
back to life.

01:02:31.585 --> 01:02:33.504
Just little things,

01:02:33.587 --> 01:02:36.465
but they can kind of be bigger
to other people.

01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:43.722
You know, the truth is,
I respect you.

01:02:43.805 --> 01:02:46.141
People might laugh,
but you push on.

01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:50.395
Endurance.
Like a real... athlete.

01:02:52.815 --> 01:02:54.733
"People have two faces"...

01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:59.196
one they have for the crowds,

01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:01.198
one they keep for themselves.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:08.622
People might push you down,
but you just gotta get back up...

01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.916
and go back to work
the next morning.

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:18.257
You know,
I saved a man from death once.

01:03:19.341 --> 01:03:22.219
I saved a man from death.

01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:25.514
The truth is, we're all
fightin'for salvation.

01:03:27.266 --> 01:03:29.726
But at the finish line,

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:32.354
you're probably
a better man than me.

01:03:35.315 --> 01:03:37.734
I'd like to help you...

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:44.616
if you think I can cut it.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.908
Get the hell out of here.

01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:52.726
What are you doin'?
What you got your panties on for?

01:04:54.186 --> 01:04:56.104
Just makin' notes.

01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:00.234
That's good.

01:05:00.317 --> 01:05:03.403
The backyard is full of fire
and electrical hazards.

01:05:03.487 --> 01:05:06.782
- I'm just makin' notes of all violations.
- "Oh, yeah?"

01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:11.995
Let me see what else
I can cut up.

01:05:28.971 --> 01:05:31.473
Buddy's ma was a decent woman.

01:05:31.557 --> 01:05:33.809
She didn't ask for no trouble.

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:38.814
But she would never let
the preacher come inside.

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.792
Too slow.
Go back to bed.

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:11.847
Damn, you seen George lately?

01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:15.309
Ever since he saved
that little boy,

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:18.479
he been walkin' around
in this superhero outfit.

01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:21.064
Crazy, man.
He ain't been talkin' to nobody.

01:06:24.693 --> 01:06:29.323
He's been... It's like he
in another world or something.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:33.619
Like he above us now since he...
saved that little boy.

01:06:36.872 --> 01:06:40.501
I can't stop thinkin' about
Buddy's mama.

01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:48.217
She was so nice, man.

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.219
She, she don't deserve this.

01:06:51.553 --> 01:06:53.764
I remember one night...

01:06:53.847 --> 01:06:55.766
we ain't had no food in the house.

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.603
So I left...

01:06:59.686 --> 01:07:04.107
and I walked past Buddy's house
and his mama was on the porch.

01:07:04.191 --> 01:07:07.027
And it's like she could feel
that I was hungry.

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:11.198
So she let me in, and we ate.

01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:13.492
It was, like,
sardines and crackers,

01:07:13.575 --> 01:07:18.705
but... I felt so bad
about eatin' it, man,

01:07:18.747 --> 01:07:22.709
'cause I knew the next day
that they wouldn't have no food.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.711
They'd go hungry.

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:29.550
Buddy was so skinny, man.

01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.762
And I got all this in reserve.

01:07:33.846 --> 01:07:36.014
I felt so bad about that.

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:41.645
Can you keep a secret?

01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:51.947
I'm not a good person,
and I don't think nice thoughts.

01:07:53.282 --> 01:07:57.786
Well, we all just a little
screwed up right now.

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:05.586
But when Buddy died,

01:08:05.627 --> 01:08:08.505
I didn't cry.

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:10.883
What good is that?

01:08:13.969 --> 01:08:16.388
Well, that's you, Sonya.

01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:20.642
You're like... your brothers, man.

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:24.188
They don't cry, they don't talk.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.149
Just go around tearin' up stuff.

01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:30.234
I guess it ain't all that bad.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.571
I didn't care at all.

01:08:32.654 --> 01:08:34.573
It didn't upset me.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:39.912
Vernon, I don't have much
to look forward to.

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:45.000
I ain't smart. I ain't no good.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.377
My whole family ain't no good.

01:08:47.461 --> 01:08:50.464
And for the first time in my life,

01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:53.509
I don't got no excuses for my future.

01:09:02.142 --> 01:09:04.603
You can come,
you can come with me, Sonya.

01:09:04.685 --> 01:09:06.604
What if it's contagious?

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:11.527
What if everybody that touches
me loses what they got?

01:09:12.986 --> 01:09:16.823
I ain't gonna catch it 'cause
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

01:09:24.413 --> 01:09:27.376
Hey, what the hell you doin'?

01:09:27.459 --> 01:09:29.795
Get away from my car!

01:09:33.966 --> 01:09:35.884
Come back here!

01:09:56.238 --> 01:09:58.157
You awake?

01:10:10.419 --> 01:10:16.175
Your sister Whitney told me you
had a dog out back of the house.

01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:21.180
That... it was
a little, ugly dog,

01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:24.183
but that you loved it.

01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:30.105
Do you think I killed your dog?

01:10:34.026 --> 01:10:37.946
All I know is I come around back
of the shed the other night...

01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:43.952
I just hid him in the bushes
and watched him bleed to death.

01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:50.834
Yeah. He was pretty
caught up, huh?

01:10:57.633 --> 01:11:02.721
Look.
I just want you to know...

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:08.310
...dogs... scare me, okay?

01:11:08.352 --> 01:11:13.315
And dogs...
they really make me nervous.

01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:18.904
You know how...

01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:20.906
dogs play around, right?

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:23.909
And they'll climb up on your leg...

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:27.246
and start, you know,
movin' up and down.

01:11:27.329 --> 01:11:30.499
Well, one time...

01:11:30.582 --> 01:11:33.627
I was about...
six years old

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:35.671
and this dog did that to me.

01:11:35.712 --> 01:11:39.925
And... he knocked me down.

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:44.346
And he started humpin' me
all over my body.

01:11:48.267 --> 01:11:51.228
It really messed my head up, okay?

01:11:53.814 --> 01:11:57.192
And I wanted so bad...

01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:00.863
to kill this dog.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:03.699
I mean, I got a drill,
and I came back lookin' for him.

01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:08.871
And, you know,
he had gone off someplace.

01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:13.208
Someplace special.

01:12:16.961 --> 01:12:19.464
Your dog...

01:12:21.133 --> 01:12:23.051
never had a chance.

01:12:24.678 --> 01:12:26.889
I never gave him a chance.

01:12:26.972 --> 01:12:29.892
I mean,
nobody told me nothin'.

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:34.813
Okay? I'm sorry.

01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:40.194
I'm sorry, all right?

01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:44.781
All I can say is that...

01:12:48.076 --> 01:12:50.037
I messed up.

01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:56.126
And, all of the sudden,
the only thing...

01:12:57.211 --> 01:13:00.422
that hits me and I'm afraid of...

01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:03.467
is God's judgement.

01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:17.189
- Hey, what's been takin' you so long?
- My mom was yellin' at me.

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:20.192
Man, some men came by my house
today lookin' for me.

01:13:20.275 --> 01:13:22.194
Man, we gotta get outta here.

01:13:28.617 --> 01:13:30.536
In his heart,

01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:33.580
I think his uncle cared about him.

01:13:33.622 --> 01:13:36.208
He knew George's helmet hurt his head.

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:40.587
So he made him a soft, new hat...

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:42.798
out of the skin of his dead dog...

01:13:44.132 --> 01:13:46.093
and an old raccoon's tail.

01:15:29.112 --> 01:15:31.990
George said he wanted to meet
a real hero.

01:15:40.249 --> 01:15:42.626
But I think he just wanted
to walk into that parade...

01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:44.962
and take his place.

01:15:45.045 --> 01:15:47.130
Maybe if no one
would look after him,

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:49.591
at least they'd look at him.

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:14.700
Excuse me.

01:16:19.454 --> 01:16:23.125
I just wanted to say
I enjoyed the parade today.

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:25.460
Thank you very much.

01:16:28.005 --> 01:16:30.465
I thought you were the best part.

01:16:41.768 --> 01:16:44.605
- What you doin'?
- Nothin'.

01:16:45.856 --> 01:16:48.734
- Some people are lookin' for you.
- I don't care.

01:16:59.203 --> 01:17:04.208
You know, there's a place near
the Arctic Circle called Lapland.

01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:06.418
The people there are called Lapps.

01:17:06.502 --> 01:17:10.881
You know, how we're called Americans
'cause we live in America.

01:17:10.964 --> 01:17:14.635
Instead of dogs, you know,
they have reindeer.

01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:16.720
They do a lot of stuff
with the reindeer...

01:17:16.804 --> 01:17:18.806
make clothes out of their fur...

01:17:18.889 --> 01:17:20.849
and they eat their meat too.

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.522
Are you a hero now?

01:17:34.112 --> 01:17:37.324
If I ever get in trouble,
will you save my life?

01:17:40.494 --> 01:17:44.039
Just don't tell nobody my real name.

01:17:44.122 --> 01:17:46.458
I'll tell 'em your name is Jorge.

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.710
That's Spanish for George.

01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:54.299
Sometimes I smile and laugh...

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:57.719
when I think about all the great
things that you're gonna do.

01:18:02.099 --> 01:18:04.059
I hope you live forever.

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:40.906
Vernon and Sonya finally stole a car.

01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:43.617
But on their way out of town,
she flipped it...

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:46.745
and almost killed them both.

01:20:06.974 --> 01:20:08.892
Do you see that?

01:20:20.612 --> 01:20:22.531
What do you see?

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:36.336
I think the driver was, like,
drinking or something.

01:20:36.378 --> 01:20:40.507
And he drove and fell down.
And then his car got messed up.

01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:44.636
I was on my way to work,
and I just see a lot of smoke
and a lot of blood down here.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.056
I looked down,
and I seen a car crashing.

01:20:48.098 --> 01:20:50.058
And I hollered out for help.

01:20:50.142 --> 01:20:52.561
Every time I look around, you
and your brother are out somewhere!

01:20:52.603 --> 01:20:54.563
- What are you doing down here?
- I didn't do anything!

01:20:54.605 --> 01:20:57.691
- I saw the smoke blazin', yo. Blood.
- All right.

01:20:57.774 --> 01:21:00.360
First, because
it was going so fast, I guess.

01:21:00.444 --> 01:21:03.906
But you don't see that.
"But, see, what it did"...

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:08.660
If the car would have
backed up, it would have fell
or at least ran into the pole.

01:21:08.744 --> 01:21:10.787
This is the eighth time
I seen you out here!

01:21:10.871 --> 01:21:14.458
Next time I'm not
gonna keep runnin' out my house,
looking for you and your brother!

01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.920
I was just standing at the bus stop, and
I see this smoke coming out of the car.

01:21:19.004 --> 01:21:21.924
- Okay, Momma.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:29.408
My heroes are...

01:22:30.659 --> 01:22:33.871
the man that invented
the steam shovel,

01:22:33.954 --> 01:22:37.416
Chubby Checker,
the Untouchables,

01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:40.836
Dick Allen,

01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:42.838
World Be Free,

01:22:44.923 --> 01:22:47.468
Great Wall of China,

01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:52.139
Uncle Sam and the president
of the United States of, of America.

01:22:53.515 --> 01:22:56.643
What makes someone a hero?

01:22:56.727 --> 01:22:59.730
I think a hero should be wise,

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:02.566
strong and very talented.

01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:07.571
They should also have a list...

01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:11.825
of dangerous and poisonous things.

01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:13.827
What makes you a hero, George?

01:23:15.454 --> 01:23:19.166
I'm a hero because...

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:22.002
I like to save people's lives.

01:23:22.044 --> 01:23:24.004
Stuff like that.

01:23:50.864 --> 01:23:54.868
Hey. Hey, where are the rest
of your friends? They're
gonna miss the fireworks.

01:23:54.952 --> 01:23:57.037
My friends are dead.

01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:01.375
What do you mean, they're dead?
They died?

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:05.045
They all got killed
in a train wreck.

01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:12.094
Man, that's tough.

01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:16.348
What are you talkin' about?

01:24:18.142 --> 01:24:23.313
All I know is I wanna be the strongest
man in the world sometimes.

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:27.568
Well, there you go.

01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:37.411
Look at my tongue.

01:24:59.475 --> 01:25:01.935
We all want families who love us...

01:25:01.977 --> 01:25:04.605
because friends go separate ways.

01:25:05.856 --> 01:25:09.067
Some of us know our place,
our home,

01:25:09.151 --> 01:25:11.069
our comfort.

01:25:12.779 --> 01:25:15.407
But for some,
it's not that simple.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.965
Buddy was just crazy.

01:25:32.049 --> 01:25:34.802
He was playing in,

01:25:34.843 --> 01:25:36.845
in the bathroom one time.

01:25:36.929 --> 01:25:38.847
He slipped.

01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:46.396
My friend George,

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.857
he told me
that he could read God's mind.

01:25:50.234 --> 01:25:53.612
He told me he knew
what God was gonna create,

01:25:53.695 --> 01:25:57.157
who He was gonna let, let die...

01:25:57.199 --> 01:25:59.535
and stuff like that.

01:26:02.955 --> 01:26:05.082
He also knew the future.

01:26:05.165 --> 01:26:08.627
He said he would fight great wars,

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:12.631
lead nations and build back up
from a broken land.

01:26:17.886 --> 01:26:20.514
Everyone thought
he was crazy but me.

01:26:22.266 --> 01:26:24.226
And who am I?

01:26:25.644 --> 01:26:27.646
My father was a banker,

01:26:27.729 --> 01:26:30.232
and my mom invented new perfume.

01:27:03.599 --> 01:27:05.517
Smile.
