01:07.200 --> 01:09.533
(Vanessa) <i>Last season on</i>
Penny Dreadful...

01:09.867 --> 01:12.100
<i>Do you believe
there is a demimonde?</i>

01:12.100 --> 01:13.800
<i>A place in the shadows,</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:16.033
<i>rarely seen, but deeply felt.</i>

01:16.767 --> 01:18.133
<i>I believe in curses.</i>

01:18.967 --> 01:22.133
<i>I believe in demons.
I believe in monsters.</i>

01:22.400 --> 01:23.800
(electricity crackling)

01:25.633 --> 01:26.800
<i>- Do you?</i>
- (sighs)

01:26.800 --> 01:27.967
What might I do for you?

01:27.967 --> 01:30.433
We have continued use
of a man of your skills.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.400
Your kind of man.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.100
One of great violence
and hidden depths.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.633
(Sir Malcolm)
Dr. Frankenstein.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.733
You seem to be a freethinker
who might imagine a world

01:40.733 --> 01:42.467
where science and superstition

01:42.467 --> 01:44.100
<i>walk hand-in-hand.</i>

01:44.100 --> 01:46.233
Your first-born has returned.

01:46.233 --> 01:47.667
Did you think
I wouldn't find you?

01:47.667 --> 01:50.400
- I'm Ethan Chandler.
- Brona Croft.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.467
(coughing)

01:51.467 --> 01:52.800
(Ethan) <i>She has consumption.</i>

01:52.800 --> 01:54.433
Best you didn't
kiss me anymore.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.267
Keep a safe distance.

01:56.267 --> 02:00.167
May I present the renowned
Madame Kali.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.267
There's another here.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.567
- (hisses)
- (speaking demonic language)

02:03.567 --> 02:06.067
- (speaking demonic language)
- (people screaming)

02:06.067 --> 02:07.367
(Ethan) <i>What's wrong with her?</i>

02:07.367 --> 02:08.832
(Sir Malcolm) <i>She's been
possessed by the Devil.</i>

02:08.833 --> 02:09.933
(screaming)

02:09.933 --> 02:12.200
This is a spell, foretelling
the annihilation of man

02:12.200 --> 02:13.700
and the coming of the beast.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.333
Why, it's Madame Kali,
is it not?

02:15.333 --> 02:16.733
It's actually Evelyn Poole.

02:16.733 --> 02:18.300
- Preferable.
- (laughing)

02:18.300 --> 02:21.233
So how's your friend?
Miss Ives?

02:21.233 --> 02:22.800
Vanessa, please!

02:23.067 --> 02:24.200
(Vanessa) <i>You don't know</i>
<i>what it's like</i>

02:24.200 --> 02:26.333
<i>having this thing inside me.</i>

02:26.667 --> 02:28.867
An animal scratching
to get out.

02:29.267 --> 02:31.500
(Ethan) <i>There are things</i>
<i>you can't control.</i>

02:31.500 --> 02:33.633
<i>At the end of the day,
the only thing we have</i>

02:33.633 --> 02:35.000
<i>is the people we trust.</i>

02:35.300 --> 02:36.867
- Mina?
- Father.

02:36.867 --> 02:37.967
(growls)

02:37.967 --> 02:39.833
- (shrieks)
- (gasping)

02:39.833 --> 02:40.967
I'm your daughter.

02:40.967 --> 02:42.533
I already have a daughter.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.967
What do you want from me?

02:46.967 --> 02:48.200
I think a companion.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.067
<i>You will make me
an immortal mate.</i>

02:51.367 --> 02:53.900
(Frankenstein)
<i>"No more let life divide</i>

02:53.900 --> 02:55.700
<i>what death can join together."</i>

02:56.133 --> 02:58.100
- (screaming)
- (groans)

02:58.100 --> 02:59.733
(Ethan) <i>There are such sins</i>
<i>at my back</i>

02:59.733 --> 03:01.733
<i>it would kill me
to turn around.</i>

03:01.733 --> 03:03.533
Your daddy says,
'Come home,' so home you come.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.200
<i>You can't run forever, Ethan.</i>

03:05.200 --> 03:06.367
- (growling)
- (gasping)

03:06.933 --> 03:08.500
(Sir Malcolm)
<i>There's a moment,</i>

03:08.500 --> 03:11.333
a moment you realize
you are no longer the hunter,

03:11.333 --> 03:13.167
you are the prey.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.167
If you have been touched
by the demon,

03:15.167 --> 03:17.867
it's like being touched
by the back hand of God.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.400
<i>Makes you sacred in a way.</i>

03:19.400 --> 03:20.667
(Vanessa) <i>There are things</i>
<i>within us all</i>

03:20.667 --> 03:22.667
<i>that can never be unleashed.</i>

03:22.667 --> 03:24.167
<i>What do those people do?</i>

03:24.167 --> 03:25.400
(clatters)

03:25.400 --> 03:26.900
<i>Those who have been chosen?</i>

03:38.200 --> 03:40.133
(children laughing
in distance)

03:48.867 --> 03:50.633
(indistinct chatter)

04:19.367 --> 04:20.733
(Madame Kali speaking
demonic language)

04:24.300 --> 04:25.800
(gasps)

04:25.800 --> 04:27.300
(continues speaking)

04:41.467 --> 04:43.300
(panting)

04:44.767 --> 04:45.767
(grunts)

04:47.667 --> 04:49.233

(bottle rolls)

08:28.200 --> 08:29.700
(horse neighs)

08:35.600 --> 08:37.000
Thank you.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.467
I need to talk to you.
Not inside the house.

08:41.167 --> 08:43.700
Take us on a tour.
Anywhere you like.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.867
(sighs heavily)

08:59.900 --> 09:01.367
I came to say goodbye.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.267
You're leaving London?

09:03.667 --> 09:05.100
I have to.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.767
Why?

09:07.333 --> 09:08.667
Miss Ives,

09:10.400 --> 09:12.533
I'm not what you think I am.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.100
And before I hurt you,

09:16.933 --> 09:19.467
or anyone here,
I need to get away.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.133
Where will you go?

09:21.600 --> 09:24.000
Spain, maybe. Or Russia.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.400
Find a war somewhere,
join a side.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.500
Do what I'm good at.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.867
And the war here?

09:29.867 --> 09:32.167
Mina's dead.
The Creature's dead. We lost.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.067
That was only a battle.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.733
Do you think the dark forces
that converge on our heads

09:37.733 --> 09:39.867
can be vanquished so easily?

09:39.867 --> 09:42.000
Do you honestly believe
you can escape them?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.767
And the other ones?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.900
The ones inside us?

09:47.700 --> 09:49.467
Inside me, you mean?

09:50.967 --> 09:52.500
No. That's not what I mean.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.967
(inhales deeply)

09:59.667 --> 10:01.467
There are times that I

10:03.600 --> 10:04.767
have...

10:05.167 --> 10:06.267
(smacks lips)

10:06.267 --> 10:07.767
Well, like these blackouts.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.433
Times I can't remember.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.467
What happens?

10:12.933 --> 10:14.433
I don't know.

10:15.467 --> 10:17.567
But there's usually blood.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.933
How can I help?

10:27.133 --> 10:29.367
You can't change what you are,

10:30.867 --> 10:33.133
no matter who you save,

10:35.600 --> 10:37.200
or who you love.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.933

- (driver shouting)

10:43.600 --> 10:44.933
(driver screaming)

10:47.400 --> 10:48.733
(horse whimpering)

10:49.633 --> 10:50.633
(silence)

10:51.867 --> 10:53.367
(Ethan breathing heavily)

11:03.267 --> 11:04.633
(growling)

11:08.100 --> 11:09.233
(Ethan grunting)

11:11.267 --> 11:12.700
(struggling)

11:15.800 --> 11:17.367
(creature screeching)

11:24.000 --> 11:25.267
(growling)

11:28.667 --> 11:29.767
(Vanessa grunting)

11:49.133 --> 11:50.533
(creatures screeching)

11:54.400 --> 11:55.633
(groans)

11:55.633 --> 11:57.633
(both breathing heavily)

12:05.100 --> 12:06.733
(softly) Are you all right?

12:07.800 --> 12:09.167
I think so.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
(speaking demonic language)

12:39.333 --> 12:41.133
(panting)

14:17.267 --> 14:18.500
Will she remember?

14:19.133 --> 14:20.467
I don't know.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.033
I hope not.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.700
Why?

14:26.433 --> 14:28.033
Her life was benighted.

14:31.267 --> 14:33.667
We'll seek
the shadows together, then.

14:36.433 --> 14:37.900
All right.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.033
Lower her in.

14:59.667 --> 15:00.867
Gently!

15:20.467 --> 15:21.800
Now we wait on the weather.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.033
May the gods bring us storms.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.467
Good night, Creator.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.267
I need to be looking for work,

15:32.667 --> 15:34.200
not a simple thing

15:34.200 --> 15:36.567
in this steel-hearted
city of yours.

15:39.567 --> 15:40.633
But have no doubt

15:41.300 --> 15:43.700
that I will never
be far from you.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.600
Wait!

15:52.167 --> 15:53.800
If this works,

15:55.500 --> 15:57.667
if I do as I've promised you,

15:57.933 --> 15:59.667
give you this thing living,

16:01.467 --> 16:03.067
will you leave me in peace?

16:03.900 --> 16:06.467
You would do better to ask
your soul to leave you.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.433
We are bound on a wheel
of pain, thee and me.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.267
I ask you,

16:16.867 --> 16:20.633
what is Dr. Frankenstein
without his Creature?

16:43.933 --> 16:45.500
(whispering) Don't let her
out of your sight.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.767
What were they?

16:48.467 --> 16:51.333
Women. I don't know.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.133
Like the others?

16:54.133 --> 16:55.967
Those with the creature
we killed?

16:57.767 --> 16:59.200
Not by a long shot.

17:09.433 --> 17:10.433
Miss Ives.

17:12.767 --> 17:13.967
Vanessa.

17:15.567 --> 17:16.867
Can you speak to me?

17:19.700 --> 17:20.867
Mr. Chandler.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.767
Can I do anything for you?

17:27.967 --> 17:28.967
You knew them?

17:30.733 --> 17:31.933
Yes.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.133
What are they?

17:37.900 --> 17:39.800
How can I help you
if you won't let me?

17:39.800 --> 17:40.933
You can't help!

17:48.267 --> 17:50.533
You were going to leave,
so go.

17:50.533 --> 17:52.800
For Christ's sake, Vanessa,
they were trying to kill you!

17:53.500 --> 17:54.700
If they were trying
to kill me,

17:54.700 --> 17:55.933
they would have.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.767
Goodbye, Mr. Chandler.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.933
Sir Malcolm
will be back tomorrow.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.500
I'll come back then.

18:22.767 --> 18:23.767
(door opens)

18:25.633 --> 18:26.967
(door closes)

18:27.567 --> 18:29.200
(inhales sharply)

18:39.033 --> 18:41.467
Do you believe the past
can return?

18:43.900 --> 18:45.333
More than that.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.067
It never leaves us.

18:49.433 --> 18:50.733
Never?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.233
It is who we are.

18:59.467 --> 19:01.400
God help us, then.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.900
(Gladys)
A hollow thing, wasn't it?

20:08.100 --> 20:12.100
Putting an empty coffin
in Peter's grave,

20:12.100 --> 20:14.133
his body left in Africa.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.600
Such a need we had
for the ceremony of it.

20:20.733 --> 20:22.733
I don't know
which makes me sadder.

20:24.367 --> 20:25.833
Mina's full coffin

20:27.500 --> 20:28.867
or Peter's empty one.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.333
Gladys,

20:33.967 --> 20:37.100
we've been too much
apart these past years.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.700
I think I should come home.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.833
We don't need
the London house.

20:42.467 --> 20:44.167
(Gladys) And what would we do?

20:45.033 --> 20:46.867
We were happy once, you and I.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.767
No, Malcolm,

20:52.700 --> 20:54.433
you were happy once.

20:55.467 --> 20:57.167
Everything that was left
between us

20:57.167 --> 20:58.367
is buried here.

21:01.467 --> 21:04.633
We shall remain married,
despite all.

21:05.367 --> 21:08.900
That modicum of decency
I'll insist upon for myself.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.967
But I'll live
in the house here.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.967
You stay in London.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.133
Or go to Africa.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.133
I don't care.

21:22.133 --> 21:24.633
If only you knew
how hard I tried to save her.

21:24.833 --> 21:28.367
We have no more children
for you to save,

21:30.033 --> 21:31.533
or to kill.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.700
(indistinct conversations)

22:13.925 --> 22:15.392
_

22:22.862 --> 22:24.342
_

23:10.914 --> 23:13.866
_

23:16.278 --> 23:17.899
_

23:22.273 --> 23:25.009
_

23:50.800 --> 23:52.067
(chuckles softly)

24:05.400 --> 24:06.567
(man whistling)

24:24.933 --> 24:26.167
Excuse me.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.333
Oh! (chuckles)

24:28.333 --> 24:30.467
Hello. Sorry.

24:30.467 --> 24:33.300
Don't like the customers
to see the magic at work.

24:38.867 --> 24:40.067
Well.

24:41.067 --> 24:43.533
Yes. (stammering)
I saw your notice.

24:43.533 --> 24:44.767
My notice?

24:45.033 --> 24:46.467
For employment.

24:46.467 --> 24:49.133
Gads, is that still up?
I'd forgotten about it.

24:49.900 --> 24:53.533
No one wants to work here.
People find it unnerving.

24:55.867 --> 24:57.167
But you don't.

24:57.633 --> 24:58.900
I find it familiar.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.433
I'll be honest
with you, friend,

25:02.433 --> 25:05.733
we're not the most financially
sound institution in London.

25:07.133 --> 25:08.667
As you can tell,

25:08.667 --> 25:10.800
the patronage is thin
to non-existent.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.267
We can't pay you much.

25:12.267 --> 25:13.500
What's the job?

25:13.767 --> 25:15.300
In an effort to compete

25:15.300 --> 25:17.400
with the dreaded
Madame Tussaud's,

25:17.400 --> 25:20.267
I'm instituting
a new bit of gimmickry

25:20.267 --> 25:21.867
intended to send those

25:22.100 --> 25:25.067
trumped-up French bastards
back to Paris.

25:26.767 --> 25:27.867
This way.

25:30.367 --> 25:32.367
My Chambers of Crime!

25:34.167 --> 25:38.367
Homicide scenes plucked
from the headlines

25:38.367 --> 25:41.933
and recreated here
in the most minute detail.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.367
Here's old Jack himself.

25:46.867 --> 25:48.433
The Annie Chapman murder.

25:49.133 --> 25:52.033
What we couldn't discover,
we invented, of course.

25:52.533 --> 25:54.200
No one will know
the difference.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.533
You tell the public
a thing is real, it is.

25:58.033 --> 26:00.700
I'm preparing a series of 'em

26:00.700 --> 26:04.933
with all the ballyhoo
I can muster.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.067
I need help with the
construction and the tableaux,

26:10.067 --> 26:13.467
along with the usual custodial
work throughout the museum.

26:15.167 --> 26:17.600
It's thankless work
in dark rooms,

26:18.200 --> 26:19.400
but it's honest.

26:20.167 --> 26:21.300
What do you think?

26:23.033 --> 26:24.033
Yes.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.233
Well, before we get you
all signed and sealed,

26:28.600 --> 26:31.033
you'll have to meet
the rest of the Putneys.

26:31.933 --> 26:34.067
We're a family concern,
you understand,

26:34.067 --> 26:36.367
and I'm beholden
on their approval.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.500
You mean the way I look.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.300
I meant more the way you are.

26:42.633 --> 26:45.300
Can you come back
this evening, say 7:00?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.033
Yes.

26:48.267 --> 26:50.967
Very good! We'll let them
try you on for size,

26:50.967 --> 26:53.200
especially me good lady wife,

26:53.533 --> 26:56.033
she who holds the pocketbook.

26:56.733 --> 26:57.733
(chuckles)

26:58.133 --> 26:59.300
Here, look at this.

27:00.167 --> 27:01.833
My newest crime,

27:03.367 --> 27:05.900
still under construction,
of course.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.333
Details are hard to come by
on this one,

27:09.333 --> 27:10.367
it's so recent.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.467
Though the newspapers
have provided

27:13.467 --> 27:14.933
some guidance.

27:16.767 --> 27:20.467
But before long
we'll have it all sorted out.

27:21.933 --> 27:25.967
Our grisly murderer exposed

27:25.967 --> 27:28.967
to the eyes of London
at two shillings a peep.

27:31.267 --> 27:35.767
I give you
the Mariner's Inn Massacre.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.800
Inspector Galsworthy said
we can get it back.

27:52.633 --> 27:54.733
Inspector Galsworthy
has been replaced.

27:55.433 --> 27:57.633
- I understand...
- This is a crime scene.

27:58.567 --> 28:00.967
You'll get it back
when I'm finished.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.200
With respect, Inspector Rusk,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.633
this is valuable
commercial property.

28:05.633 --> 28:07.600
The owners want
to build on the site.

28:09.233 --> 28:10.967
What do they want to build?

28:10.967 --> 28:14.400
What? Oh, um, tenement blocks.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.867
(Rusk) That's a shame.
More brick.

28:19.267 --> 28:21.967
There'll be no wood left
in the city before long.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.900
Brick lasts longer.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.533
But without character.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.667
Wood holds its history.

28:39.267 --> 28:42.500
(Broker) You'll forgive me
for asking, but, uh,

28:42.500 --> 28:43.933
this is like Spitalfields, eh?

28:45.567 --> 28:47.367
The Ripper back again?

28:47.367 --> 28:48.833
You think so?

28:49.600 --> 28:51.033
Reckon it must be.

28:51.967 --> 28:52.967
Why?

28:54.467 --> 28:56.867
Can there be two monsters
like that in our city?

28:59.467 --> 29:00.867
This one is different.

29:02.733 --> 29:04.867
This time
there was a survivor.

29:57.967 --> 30:00.000
She didn't leave her room.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.667
All day?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.233
All day.

30:07.867 --> 30:10.733
This is something
I never thought I'd see.

30:10.733 --> 30:11.833
What?

30:12.700 --> 30:14.733
Here's a woman
who faced down that Creature

30:14.733 --> 30:16.400
in the theater
without blinking.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.367
And held her ground
against Satan himself.

30:19.367 --> 30:20.367
But now...

30:24.700 --> 30:26.333
I've never seen
her frightened.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.867
(metal clanging)

30:59.233 --> 31:00.967
(breathing deeply)

31:28.000 --> 31:30.267
What will you make
of this life, I wonder?

31:33.600 --> 31:35.167
I'll miss talking to you.

31:38.067 --> 31:40.067
It's good to have someone
to talk to.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.400
You'll learn that soon enough.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.667
You'll learn everything.

31:52.233 --> 31:53.567
Who will you be?

32:01.500 --> 32:03.300
Will this hand ever know love?

32:37.633 --> 32:38.633
(ragged breathing)

32:40.400 --> 32:41.567
(sighs)

32:50.600 --> 32:51.767
- (knocking on door)
- (gasps)

32:55.100 --> 32:56.367
I'll be back soon.

33:14.700 --> 33:15.833
You are required.

33:18.033 --> 33:21.033
- Let me fetch my bag.
- You will not need it.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.233
What will I need?

33:23.033 --> 33:24.133
Courage.

33:28.433 --> 33:30.667
(indistinct conversations)

33:48.700 --> 33:50.867
He's told you about the work?

33:51.167 --> 33:52.433
Yes, ma'am.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.933
The hours are one hour
before opening

33:57.933 --> 34:00.267
until two hours
after we close,

34:00.267 --> 34:01.967
which is midnight on weekends.

34:01.967 --> 34:03.000
We take no holidays,

34:03.000 --> 34:04.967
we observe
no religious occasions.

34:04.967 --> 34:07.333
The pay is 15 shillings
per week, flat.

34:08.367 --> 34:09.367
Yes, ma'am.

34:11.533 --> 34:12.800
What's your name?

34:15.567 --> 34:18.699
John. Clare.
John Clare, ma'am.

34:22.132 --> 34:23.167
Sign.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.733
Perhaps he should meet
our Lavinia?

34:36.467 --> 34:38.967
(Octavia) Lavinia!
Come in here.

34:41.132 --> 34:44.500
Come meet the new man
we've hired, Mr. Clare.

34:47.033 --> 34:48.132
Miss Putney.

34:51.766 --> 34:52.900
Mr. Clare.

34:57.433 --> 34:59.067
May I touch your face?

35:05.633 --> 35:07.433
It is not a face for touching.

35:07.767 --> 35:09.867
Then I will never meet you.

35:11.133 --> 35:12.333
Please.

35:17.700 --> 35:18.800
If you must.

35:22.833 --> 35:24.033
(breathing raggedly)

35:53.300 --> 35:56.267
It is good to meet you,
Mr. Clare.

35:59.333 --> 36:00.733
Would you show
Mr. Clare out, dear?

36:01.900 --> 36:03.333
This way, sir.

36:10.533 --> 36:11.867
That face!

36:12.733 --> 36:15.100
What in God's name
are you thinking?

36:15.100 --> 36:17.067
He'll scare away
the few customers we have.

36:17.067 --> 36:18.067
Quiet, woman!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.667
That face
will make our fortune.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.700
(indistinct conversations)

36:52.233 --> 36:53.900
(horses neighing)

36:55.867 --> 36:56.867
(door opens)

37:16.867 --> 37:18.433
(clock ticking)

37:19.367 --> 37:20.667
Then what were they?

37:20.667 --> 37:21.733
(Ethan) Women.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.600
But not your usual run.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.833
And not the creatures of which
we've had recent experience?

37:26.833 --> 37:28.000
(Ethan) No.

37:29.033 --> 37:31.767
They were branded
and deeply scarred.

37:32.133 --> 37:33.600
The devil's mark.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.000
Those in the service
of the demon

37:40.000 --> 37:41.667
are irrevocably marked.

37:43.700 --> 37:46.767
His claws rake across them
to seal their obedience.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.967
No, Sir Malcolm,

37:50.967 --> 37:53.233
these were not the creatures
we faced before.

37:56.267 --> 37:57.900
Not as steady as I would like.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.900
Thank you, Doctor.

38:01.533 --> 38:02.633
(groans)

38:03.600 --> 38:05.367
(Frankenstein)
You should rest.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.800
You've been through a lot.
Just rest.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.067
And did you know
the language they spoke?

38:14.067 --> 38:15.933
- It was Latin.
- (Vanessa) No.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.833
It was the Verbis Diablo.

38:19.333 --> 38:21.433
If I remember my theological
studies correctly,

38:21.433 --> 38:23.667
- that's quite impossible.
- What is it?

38:24.300 --> 38:26.133
- A mythical language.
- (Ethan) No.

38:26.533 --> 38:27.933
A dead language.

38:29.833 --> 38:30.967
The word of the devil.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.500
According to Biblical lore,

38:32.500 --> 38:34.533
the Verbis Diablo
is a corruption

38:34.533 --> 38:36.500
of angelical speech.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.000
What Adam spoke in Paradise

38:38.000 --> 38:40.333
before the serpent made
his memorable appearance.

38:40.333 --> 38:41.500
(Ethan) The story goes,

38:41.500 --> 38:44.267
Satan took God's language
and turned it inside out.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.167
After the fall of man,
God spoke to Adam,

38:49.167 --> 38:51.900
but Adam could no longer
understand him.

38:53.033 --> 38:55.267
"Why is my language
unclear to thee?

38:57.500 --> 39:00.267
Because you now belong
to your father, the devil."

39:03.500 --> 39:04.667
You do know this is all myth.

39:04.667 --> 39:05.900
Those women weren't.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.033
Well, I don't know
what you saw, Ethan,

39:07.033 --> 39:08.267
but I highly doubt
they were figments

39:08.267 --> 39:09.567
conjured from
Galilean fantasies

39:09.567 --> 39:10.633
speaking a dead language.

39:11.533 --> 39:13.500
Vanessa, did you know

39:14.100 --> 39:15.633
the words she said to you?

39:16.433 --> 39:17.433
No.

39:18.467 --> 39:19.933
I don't remember much.

39:20.633 --> 39:24.067
The words came to me blindly,
like an animal instinct.

39:24.967 --> 39:26.700
I don't even know what I said.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.633
Whatever it was
scared them off.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.600
Then should we not begin
by finding a way

39:31.600 --> 39:32.800
to understand the language?

39:33.100 --> 39:34.100
Begin what?

39:34.333 --> 39:36.567
Whatever's required
to protect Miss Ives.

39:36.567 --> 39:38.067
(Frankenstein) And what
are we protecting her from?

39:38.067 --> 39:39.333
You can't help me!

39:41.267 --> 39:43.300
This is a battle I must
fight on my own!

39:45.000 --> 39:46.300
I'm not leaving you.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.300
Mr. Chandler.

39:48.567 --> 39:49.833
Vanessa.

39:50.667 --> 39:52.333
I lost one daughter,
I'm not prepared

39:52.333 --> 39:53.533
to lose another.

39:54.367 --> 39:56.667
Not for anything
in this world.

39:58.133 --> 40:00.200
All together we've seen things
not of this world

40:00.200 --> 40:02.998
and have proven ourselves
capable of defeating them.

40:06.667 --> 40:07.867
What were they?

40:11.100 --> 40:12.867
You knew their kind.

40:14.033 --> 40:15.633
They are Nightcomers.

40:19.033 --> 40:20.200
Witches.

(thunder rumbling)

41:49.217 --> 41:51.283
(footsteps approaching)

41:53.450 --> 41:54.450
Mother.

42:09.683 --> 42:10.983
Darlings,

42:11.483 --> 42:13.317
I must confess to a modicum
of disappointment

42:13.317 --> 42:15.083
about the events
of last evening.

42:16.217 --> 42:18.050
Disillusionment even.

42:18.050 --> 42:20.117
I should have gone, Mother.

42:20.117 --> 42:22.050
These three are unequal
to our great task.

42:22.317 --> 42:24.517
No, Hecate, the fault's mine.

42:25.517 --> 42:27.983
I believed us to be
more powerful than we are.

42:29.617 --> 42:31.583
But the man concerns me.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.617
She has a protector.

42:33.617 --> 42:34.750
<i>Lupus Dei.</i>

42:41.250 --> 42:42.383
And he is powerful.

42:42.983 --> 42:46.383
So our task is made
yet more daunting.

42:48.717 --> 42:51.517
Meaning we shall have
to be yet more ingenious.

42:51.950 --> 42:54.517
We shall have
to employ stratagems.

42:55.517 --> 42:57.950
He shall be your challenge,
daughter,

42:58.483 --> 42:59.483
she, mine.

43:00.183 --> 43:02.750
I shall begin by enticing
dear Sir Malcolm.

43:03.750 --> 43:06.250
My old friend Miss Ives
won't escape me.

43:08.650 --> 43:11.450
The Master won't
be denied his prize.

43:12.283 --> 43:15.850
Even now he twitches
for his beloved,

43:17.383 --> 43:20.017
his great tail wrapping
around her ankle

43:20.017 --> 43:23.050
- and up and up.
- Yes.

43:23.050 --> 43:25.283
Give me another
chance, please.

43:35.750 --> 43:38.583
- You failed once, pet.
- But she knew the language.

43:41.350 --> 43:43.117
- She spoke it?
- Yes.

43:45.017 --> 43:46.383
What did she say?

43:46.383 --> 43:47.617
It was unclear.

43:47.617 --> 43:49.083
- Did she mumble?
- No.

43:50.317 --> 43:51.917
I didn't hear it entirely,
I mean.

43:52.183 --> 43:53.883
Then the fault's yours.

44:02.550 --> 44:04.450
Do you know
what this room holds?

44:05.750 --> 44:10.383
The old Romans
called them <i>Memento Mori.</i>

44:11.850 --> 44:14.317
Tokens of death.

44:14.983 --> 44:16.817
The story goes
that a famous general

44:16.817 --> 44:18.583
was returning from battle,

44:18.583 --> 44:20.050
his chariot piled high

44:20.050 --> 44:22.617
with the golden spoils
of his victory.

44:22.617 --> 44:24.617
He thrust out his chest

44:24.617 --> 44:27.217
to proclaim his invincibility
to the people.

44:27.217 --> 44:29.083
Well, a slave saw this

44:29.083 --> 44:31.983
and threw an old bone
at the general's feet, saying,

44:32.217 --> 44:36.150
"Remember,
death comes for us all."

44:37.383 --> 44:40.517
And from that day,
it became a custom in Rome

44:40.517 --> 44:42.283
that a slave
stand in the chariot

44:42.283 --> 44:44.817
behind every general
returning in victory,

44:44.817 --> 44:49.383
holding a skull
and whispering into his ear.

44:50.283 --> 44:51.750
<i>(speaking Latin)</i>

44:58.783 --> 45:00.317
"Look behind you.

45:00.550 --> 45:03.017
Remember that you are a man.

45:04.650 --> 45:07.383
Remember that you will die."

45:10.383 --> 45:12.150
- (gasps)
- (hisses)

45:13.517 --> 45:14.550
(gurgling)

45:24.817 --> 45:27.417
Take that bitch away.

45:47.017 --> 45:49.250
I've seen that look
in her eyes.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.750
After a battle.

45:56.017 --> 45:57.850
She'll talk to us
in her own time.

45:57.850 --> 45:59.117
And until then?

46:03.317 --> 46:05.083
I was intending
to leave London.

46:05.950 --> 46:07.483
Now I don't think I should.

46:08.850 --> 46:10.383
I appreciate that.

46:11.783 --> 46:14.250
- You have a guest room?
- Yes.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.750
I'll stay there.

46:15.750 --> 46:17.583
You mean stay with us?

46:17.583 --> 46:18.917
That's what I mean.

46:20.050 --> 46:22.583
I'll have Sembene
prepare the room.

46:22.583 --> 46:23.817
I can do it.

46:31.783 --> 46:33.383
(child wailing)

46:39.417 --> 46:40.417
Hurry!

46:41.550 --> 46:42.750
Quickly!

46:46.183 --> 46:47.717
Connect those batteries!

46:48.283 --> 46:49.383
That lever!

46:53.717 --> 46:55.317
And now the next two!

47:07.950 --> 47:09.850
We must catch the storm!

47:12.283 --> 47:13.283
(grunting)

47:20.450 --> 47:21.617
Help me!

47:26.017 --> 47:27.383
When I say,

47:27.383 --> 47:29.483
raise the main conductor!
Not yet!

47:31.350 --> 47:32.350
Now!

47:32.583 --> 47:33.583
(grunting)

47:44.250 --> 47:46.317
I have to modulate the charge!

47:48.083 --> 47:50.317
Release the pressure
on the conductors!

47:50.317 --> 47:51.350
Take them down by half!

47:51.917 --> 47:52.950
More!

47:53.150 --> 47:54.983
Start at a 10% charge!

48:04.950 --> 48:06.717
Please, please.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.850
Please, please, please,
please, please.

48:08.850 --> 48:10.050
Get back!

48:17.050 --> 48:18.050
(panting)

48:38.150 --> 48:40.083
Please, let her live.

48:41.650 --> 48:44.417
Let her live, now!

48:45.950 --> 48:47.883
Let her live!

48:49.250 --> 48:50.383
Now!

48:50.383 --> 48:52.683
- Let her live, now!
- Now!

48:52.917 --> 48:54.950
(screaming) Now!

48:54.950 --> 48:56.283
(screaming) Now!

48:56.283 --> 48:57.783
- Now!
- Now!

48:58.083 --> 48:59.083
Now!

48:59.517 --> 49:00.517
Now!

49:08.550 --> 49:09.683
(crackling)

49:23.650 --> 49:24.650
(groaning)

49:34.483 --> 49:35.650
(panting)

50:04.717 --> 50:05.717

50:23.217 --> 50:24.650

52:52.317 --> 52:53.917

53:18.183 --> 53:21.483

My beloved Lucifer.

53:21.483 --> 53:24.717
I have found her for you
and she shall be yours.

53:25.117 --> 53:28.483
I shall assault
her days and her nights,

53:28.483 --> 53:31.050
her dreams and her prayers.

53:31.183 --> 53:33.883
No corner of her soul
shall be safe.

53:33.917 --> 53:38.883
Every beat of her heart
she shall know only suffering.

53:39.217 --> 53:40.917
I will not fail you.

53:40.917 --> 53:44.850
I will not fail you.
I will not fail you.
