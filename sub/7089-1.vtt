00:32.040 --> 00:35.179
There are 196 countries in the world.

00:35.935 --> 00:39.104
Each country shares a common myth about the creature

00:39.397 --> 00:41.578
terrorizing and attacking its inhabitants.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.416
Half the world's population, more than 3 million people

00:44.698 --> 00:46.381
They swear que These legends are true.

00:55.945 --> 00:57.946
My name is Scott Williams.

00:58.307 --> 00:59.214
This is not a joke.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.286
I am an American tourist in Panama.

01:01.587 --> 01:03.286
We are in Darien Forest.

01:04.474 --> 01:06.355
This will not do, there is the coverage here.

01:07.043 --> 01:09.502
We went very far in Forest and ...

01:09.765 --> 01:12.591
we do not know where we are and something is chasing us.

01:12.913 --> 01:15.759
If you are watching this video, please show someone

01:16.028 --> 01:17.010
que can help us.

01:21.887 --> 01:22.814
Please!

01:23.083 --> 01:24.082
Help us!

01:24.677 --> 01:26.069
Two of my friends ...

01:38.955 --> 01:41.604
2 DAYS BEFORE

01:47.538 --> 01:50.056
And Then your nerd! When you come here?

01:51.008 --> 01:52.187
We left for two hours.

01:52.495 --> 01:54.067
You are not at the airport?

01:54.293 --> 01:55.946
No, I'm waiting for Steph.

01:56.218 --> 01:58.265
She is taking a shower? Yup.

01:58.475 --> 02:01.146
Let me take a look. No way, asshole!

02:01.364 --> 02:04.033
Come on, we're friends. I see you are safe and sound.

02:07.523 --> 02:08.692
What time arrived there?

02:08.935 --> 02:10.613
This morning. This place is very beautiful.

02:10.935 --> 02:12.331
You will love!

02:12.577 --> 02:17.127
Friend, When They get here will be tan, They Will not Recognize me.

02:17.446 --> 02:19.243
This is Steph?

02:19.490 --> 02:20.827
Who's this?

02:21.123 --> 02:22.276
Why do you ask?

02:22.533 --> 02:24.189
The work for the next 10 days.

02:24.413 --> 02:25.209
Yes of course.

02:25.472 --> 02:28.388
At work, programming, anything. Just you and me.

02:28.630 --> 02:30.687
I will reward que sacrifice.

02:31.969 --> 02:34.089
I was practicing the "inverted cachorinho"

02:34.360 --> 02:36.804
Something extremely sexy to a veterinary student

02:37.037 --> 02:38.634
using animals to creep positions.

02:38.891 --> 02:39.657
Oh really?

02:39.863 --> 02:41.974
It will be even better when i become a real one.

02:42.231 --> 02:44.302
The long as you do not want to practice an enema.

02:44.529 --> 02:45.718
I can not promise that.

02:45.941 --> 02:49.538
I'm still listening to you guys. What a strange duplinha.

02:49.911 --> 02:53.241
Raise your butt and come back here. Panama, dear!

03:01.663 --> 03:03.170
Arrivals

03:11.240 --> 03:15.518
Okay, so Steph, we are already in Panama.

03:15.744 --> 03:16.733
First impressions?

03:17.105 --> 03:18.001
First impressions?

03:18.309 --> 03:21.882
I'm wondering if this will be on all the time here.

03:22.067 --> 03:24.676
We have to show the world our experiences.

03:25.033 --> 03:28.072
No, the world does not need to know everything.

03:28.596 --> 03:31.297
OK thank you.

03:34.012 --> 03:35.448
It is our car?

05:02.381 --> 05:03.202
Hello tourists!

05:03.393 --> 05:04.361
Hi!

05:04.607 --> 05:06.235
Why take so long?

05:06.447 --> 05:07.600
This place is in the middle of nowhere, man.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.568
Go to check in, the bar is waiting.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.537
This place is perfect, it is a paradise.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.783
Come on! See you later.

05:17.548 --> 05:19.216
Mind if I join?

05:19.493 --> 05:23.841
Of course I care, this shower is too small for two, then ...

05:24.080 --> 05:25.390
No more jokes, funny.

06:06.086 --> 06:07.719
Ladies, Gentlemen,

06:08.036 --> 06:09.448
My God, the speech!

06:09.690 --> 06:11.267
Goofball!

06:11.503 --> 06:12.994
Cheers!

06:13.271 --> 06:16.939
Maravihoso Has Been traveling the world with our group of friends.

06:17.372 --> 06:19.826
That's very cute.

06:20.415 --> 06:23.818
We Traveled the world together but maybe this is the last time

06:24.084 --> 06:28.180
before the real world in the swallow. Let us be worth it.

06:28.464 --> 06:29.748
Personal health!

06:37.294 --> 06:38.294
Come on!

06:44.186 --> 06:45.133
It is animated?

06:45.397 --> 06:46.731
I'm very excited.

06:47.004 --> 06:48.339
Here we go!

06:48.733 --> 06:50.849
I have just Been accepted into the Faculty of Veterinary.

06:51.135 --> 06:52.403
Happy birthday!

06:52.618 --> 06:55.287
Speaking of animation, congratulations on your new restaurant, Elena.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.462
Thanks.

06:56.678 --> 06:59.938
I Took a peek on the Web page and is amazing.

07:00.149 --> 07:02.765
Charlie is a teacher. Screw you!

07:02.967 --> 07:03.511
Really.

07:03.758 --> 07:06.634
I still feel the taste of "Gambas al ajillo".

07:06.856 --> 07:07.943
It was good.

07:08.141 --> 07:09.341
What was the other thing ...

07:09.668 --> 07:10.600
Meatballs.

07:10.826 --> 07:12.020
And the wine?

07:12.327 --> 07:14.678
Spanish wine. Rioja. My idea.

07:14.887 --> 07:18.099
Yes, I'm just the guy the food, right?

07:29.822 --> 07:30.703
I dare you.

07:30.998 --> 07:32.588
Which is? Yup!

07:34.816 --> 07:36.141
If I win,

07:36.392 --> 07:38.726
I go to Those Two hot chicks there.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.890
They are not as tasty, but okay.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.178
Come on!

07:44.430 --> 07:45.623
Do not look!

07:45.881 --> 07:46.744
And if you lose?

07:47.700 --> 07:48.738
If I lose,

07:49.831 --> 07:51.858
I go to Those Two hot chicks there.

07:52.828 --> 07:53.705
Countdown.

07:56.182 --> 07:57.132
Oops!

07:57.487 --> 07:58.303
Oops!

08:05.156 --> 08:05.958
Cum!

08:07.926 --> 08:10.447
I'll see if one of the two wants to show me the Panama Canal.

08:12.548 --> 08:13.183
Which is!

08:13.485 --> 08:14.357
That nasty.

08:14.598 --> 08:15.889
Comically unpleasant.

08:17.224 --> 08:18.332
Hello ladies!

08:18.639 --> 08:23.204
My name is Trevor, I came from far away to invite Them for a drink.

08:23.449 --> 08:27.589
Look, you speak very well to be a gringo, good Pronunciation.

08:27.929 --> 08:28.647
Thank you.

08:28.949 --> 08:35.422
I think the dance would be good. What do you think? OK?

09:03.639 --> 09:05.457
How is it going? The will?

09:05.717 --> 09:06.159
Good.

09:06.411 --> 09:09.242
This is Julius, one of my closest friends.

09:09.489 --> 09:10.724
A typical boy Panama.

09:10.945 --> 09:12.221
Born and raised right here.

09:12.487 --> 09:13.036
Trevor.

09:13.277 --> 09:14.028
Hi, Charlie.

09:14.240 --> 09:14.950
Scott.

09:15.178 --> 09:16.154
They are enjoying Panama?

09:16.463 --> 09:20.166
Very, beautiful views, nice people, not to like?

09:20.448 --> 09:21.782
Panama is a good choice.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.121
The surf, seafood and women.

09:24.370 --> 09:25.340
A toast to that!

09:26.746 --> 09:28.716
I said, "Mom, Dad, I'm not gay"

09:28.917 --> 09:30.193
he was sucking my dick.

09:31.558 --> 09:32.701
Okay, one more.

09:32.954 --> 09:35.555
You know how to have fun, huh.

09:43.425 --> 09:44.640
How about we leave here?

09:46.191 --> 09:52.858
Will have to take more than 4 drinks to Achieve this, you will have to work harder.

09:58.768 --> 09:59.680
Hey, buddy?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.545
What's next for you?

10:01.796 --> 10:03.690
Man, I do not know.

10:04.038 --> 10:04.976
I have no idea.

10:05.247 --> 10:08.079
The economy is shit lately.

10:08.347 --> 10:11.812
Any team may withdraw my scholarship.

10:12.986 --> 10:15.142
I do not really like to move back in with my parents.

10:15.395 --> 10:16.664
It would suck.

10:16.937 --> 10:19.385
Especially because the old man always says:

10:19.622 --> 10:23.832
"Scott, your generation does not know what it is to work hard."

10:25.593 --> 10:26.476
Nonsense.

10:26.767 --> 10:31.322
Most of us want to work but there is no job.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.879
Health, man.

10:39.131 --> 10:40.840
Local activities in Panama

10:49.126 --> 10:51.426
Alley Darien

10:59.478 --> 11:01.468
Love, heard this Alley of Darien?

11:01.736 --> 11:02.446
The homeland?

11:02.753 --> 11:04.884
It is a forest near here.

11:07.147 --> 11:08.210
Very close.

11:15.168 --> 11:18.529
Actually give up to Alaska's car to go to Argentina

11:18.780 --> 11:20.349
if not for this little piece of forest.

11:21.810 --> 11:22.822
Do not you find it strange?

11:23.114 --> 11:24.651
No, why?

11:25.104 --> 11:27.191
This is in Panama, like ...

11:27.427 --> 11:30.657
They built the Panama Canal cutting America in half.

11:30.947 --> 11:32.779
Making Become Difficult to cross this forest.

11:38.609 --> 11:40.457
Young Disappeared

11:40.962 --> 11:41.959
What the fuck?

11:42.260 --> 11:44.010
Missing tourists

11:44.256 --> 11:47.955
Darling, will stay in this thing all night?

15:00.827 --> 15:02.192
That's why we're here, boys.

15:02.516 --> 15:04.097
Baltic, 2008.

15:04.359 --> 15:05.156
It was cold.

15:05.417 --> 15:07.473
Cornwall, 2010.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.202
Horrible face, had the waves.

15:09.462 --> 15:10.633
But I'm from there.

15:12.894 --> 15:14.215
Costa Rica, Caribbean.

15:14.508 --> 15:15.803
A little disappointing.

15:16.105 --> 15:17.258
And now, the Pacific.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.220
The girls ended the talk? Yup.

15:58.296 --> 16:02.111
Have you seen the video of some young people who Were lost here in the woods?

16:02.358 --> 16:03.108
Already.

16:03.355 --> 16:06.131
So far are only speculations of what happened.

16:06.393 --> 16:08.036
What you mean?

16:08.312 --> 16:11.503
Which so far it is just speculation of what happened.

16:11.795 --> 16:14.818
On the internet it says que residents here believe

16:15.070 --> 16:17.544
It has to with such of the "Chupacabra".

16:18.012 --> 16:18.944
What is this, anyway?

16:19.257 --> 16:21.690
The Chupacabra is real for many people, is not an Animal.

16:21.957 --> 16:25.148
My people believe que the Chupacabra is like ...

16:25.838 --> 16:26.826
How can I say?

16:27.969 --> 16:29.199
Like a demon.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.009
It is not human nor beast.

16:32.275 --> 16:35.752
It's like a trapped spirit in a body half man, half monster.

16:36.205 --> 16:39.113
And why there is still the DariÃ©n Forest.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.986
No one wants to get into que forest.

16:42.303 --> 16:44.294
It is a pity.

16:44.757 --> 16:49.186
Why there is a small waterfall Were we going to when i was a kid.

16:49.433 --> 16:52.200
Because of These incidents, do not let in more.

16:54.074 --> 16:55.512
It's a big world, folks.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.816
And there are many things we do not know or understand.

17:01.431 --> 17:03.668
Is he Became very self-centered.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.681
Everything is on it, is all about Charlie.

17:07.849 --> 17:08.844
I'm sorry.

17:12.289 --> 17:14.041
It must be Very difficult with the restaurant.

17:14.365 --> 17:17.332
Yes anyway ...

17:21.031 --> 17:22.367
You look beautiful.

17:23.188 --> 17:24.191
And you and Scott?

17:24.463 --> 17:25.833
We are OK.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.102
Want to see what he's working on? Yup.

17:29.386 --> 17:32.218
Still in Beta version.

17:32.450 --> 17:33.532
What is beta?

17:33.780 --> 17:36.879
The technical term for something in development.

17:37.177 --> 17:39.938
Or like me I always say: Do not blame me if it works.

17:41.369 --> 17:42.497
Here, look.

17:42.749 --> 17:45.264
Now record the video for your family.

17:45.557 --> 17:46.946
No. Yes.

17:48.322 --> 17:49.731
How am I?

17:49.950 --> 17:50.952
Great.

17:51.215 --> 17:54.158
Hi guys, we are in Panama Beach.

17:54.399 --> 17:56.661
We're having fun with great companies.

17:56.999 --> 17:57.871
Hi!

17:58.107 --> 18:00.642
And we hope to see you soon.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.435
I love you all.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.003
It was horrible.

18:04.234 --> 18:06.563
So it has a face recognition function.

18:06.815 --> 18:08.467
You upload to YouTube and Facebook,

18:08.699 --> 18:10.902
he Recognizes the contacts from your phone

18:11.199 --> 18:13.615
and automatically marks Them.

18:13.879 --> 18:15.416
See, look at that!

18:15.642 --> 18:17.215
Cool huh? Yup!

18:17.481 --> 18:18.883
You will be rich.

18:19.225 --> 18:20.701
I also want.

18:35.772 --> 18:38.144
Julius, we visit the waterfall tomorrow.

18:38.473 --> 18:39.585
Tell us something more about.

18:39.888 --> 18:44.160
The waterfall on the mountain is completely fresh and clean.

18:44.444 --> 18:47.432
I remember When We Were children, They said ...

18:47.738 --> 18:52.495
It was a magical place, full of good energy and vibrations

18:52.713 --> 18:56.596
luck, health ... Amazing, beautiful.

18:59.686 --> 19:02.728
What? Which waterfall is she talking about?

19:03.171 --> 19:06.286
The same as Julius Told us yesterday.

19:06.754 --> 19:10.075
An amazing place They Were When They Were going children but

19:10.462 --> 19:13.012
Now the input is prohibited.

19:13.315 --> 19:14.926
Prohibited?

19:15.233 --> 19:17.120
I do not know, it seems like a good idea.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.665
We can not go there, folks.

19:18.937 --> 19:19.981
Why can not we?

19:20.208 --> 19:23.916
There is a local legend que Prohibits.

19:24.143 --> 19:26.396
I honestly do not think it's for both.

19:26.637 --> 19:29.509
We have a beautiful place, how far away from here?

19:29.777 --> 19:32.891
One hour drive and an hour walk.

19:33.161 --> 19:36.105
So this beautiful place two hours away,

19:36.417 --> 19:38.417
has a crystal-clear waterfall,

19:38.699 --> 19:41.259
providing good luck and health.

19:41.501 --> 19:43.104
We can have it for ourselves,

19:43.330 --> 19:45.089
and you do not want to go?

19:45.330 --> 19:47.830
Trevor Believes que magic waterfall

19:48.142 --> 19:50.037
It makes the penis grow or would be lucky too?

19:50.259 --> 19:52.718
No, it Gives you a huge dick, type size jumbo.

19:52.955 --> 19:54.799
Which is?

19:55.076 --> 19:56.008
It looks great.

19:56.305 --> 19:58.356
But They did not come for the beaches and the surf?

19:58.659 --> 20:01.764
Who cares about the beaches, this place looks much better.

20:02.014 --> 20:03.239
Never seen a waterfall before?

20:03.476 --> 20:06.045
Not a waterfall with a magic pool.

20:06.262 --> 20:09.114
It will not take Them there.

20:13.008 --> 20:14.953
It is no longer a safe place.

20:15.206 --> 20:17.437
Bad things happened there.

20:20.209 --> 20:22.244
Also you will not there.

20:22.506 --> 20:23.116
It's all right.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.036
Promise me.

20:25.288 --> 20:26.441
It's ok.

20:26.688 --> 20:27.652
Traffic.

20:27.923 --> 20:29.193
I promise you.

20:38.768 --> 20:41.227
If you do not take us, we will alone.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.485
Would you like?

20:44.285 --> 20:46.579
If not dangerous, why would ban?

20:46.888 --> 20:49.687
Probably for tourists not put weight in place.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.582
Moreover, it is just a myth.

20:51.809 --> 20:55.069
How many tourists Were killed by the Loch Ness Monster?

20:55.366 --> 20:57.628
Yes, or at Bigfoot. Right?

20:57.885 --> 20:59.342
I think so.

20:59.730 --> 21:03.006
Look, do not put you in danger.

21:03.337 --> 21:06.361
And the video, Which Attacked the boys?

21:06.617 --> 21:07.636
It's just an assembly.

21:07.943 --> 21:10.724
What, you saw the video, you can not see anything.

21:11.002 --> 21:14.534
Steph, you study the animals, I bet you did not know the Chupacabra.

21:17.371 --> 21:19.507
Okay, If They guarantee it is safe.

21:19.764 --> 21:21.649
Yes, it's totally safe.

21:21.926 --> 21:22.570
Saw?

21:22.833 --> 21:24.152
It is completely safe.

21:25.926 --> 21:27.381
For I will not.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.468
What is Elena?

21:28.724 --> 21:29.843
The I convince you?

21:30.121 --> 21:31.858
No, will you and to experience this adventure,

21:32.203 --> 21:35.094
I will relax and drink a few drinks by the pool.

21:36.812 --> 21:38.682
Fine with me, man.

21:39.019 --> 21:40.233

Or you can stay in my room.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.672
No, I told you I'm not that kind of woman.

21:54.988 --> 21:56.463
Clear.

22:15.032 --> 22:16.846
At last.

22:17.164 --> 22:18.647

23:57.515 --> 23:58.709
Ah yes, the gringos?

23:58.985 --> 24:01.032
They left just now with Carmen in the car.

24:01.394 --> 24:03.174
Bye! Bye!

24:20.410 --> 24:21.540
Okay, guys.

Ok, is the narrator and tell us what you see around.

25:32.095 --> 25:36.478
What we have here is the famous and lush forest of Panama.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.681
Green far as you can see.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.682
Wait, wait!

25:42.293 --> 25:45.761
Deep in the forest, there is a beautiful dark-haired.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.934
As the midnight sky. Is beautiful.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.020

26:11.006 --> 26:12.242
idea of â€‹â€‹entering the forest.

26:36.785 --> 26:39.440
Sorry, what are you afraid?

26:39.798 --> 26:41.375

A place where They can not hear us.

32:28.195 --> 32:29.114

It is getting difficult.

32:47.064 --> 32:48.485
She's just being a woman.

Charlie, go make peace with Elena.

35:32.709 --> 35:34.459
Take your stick to someone else.

35:38.415 --> 35:39.785
It's nothing!

35:41.040 --> 35:42.505
There is nothing there.

Definitely I heard something.

Trevor!

36:52.744 --> 36:54.165

Scott!

38:59.131 --> 39:00.763
Have you seen Carmen?

39:00.965 --> 39:02.174
What happened? We heard screams.

39:02.396 --> 39:06.039
I went to see about the noise, she cried, I went back and found it.

39:06.275 --> 39:08.151
What the fuck? My God!

39:08.357 --> 39:10.024
What's going on Trevor? I hope it's no joke.

39:10.211 --> 39:11.954
I'm not kidding, something happened.

39:12.196 --> 39:14.806
Okay, let's calm down.

39:15.058 --> 39:16.846
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for all this.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.691
It's all right! Carmen!

39:19.003 --> 39:20.267
Carmen!

39:20.431 --> 39:22.099
Personally, I do not like that. We have to get out of here.

39:22.345 --> 39:23.716
We can not abandon it.

39:27.303 --> 39:29.183
You have a signal?

39:29.436 --> 39:30.972
Yes, it has a small bar. Give me that!

39:42.063 --> 39:43.916
It is the cell of Carmen? Yup.

39:44.133 --> 39:45.614

Give me the phone, I'll call to the hotel, explain what happened ...

40:08.720 --> 40:10.284
and say where we are. Everything will be fine.

40:10.878 --> 40:12.223
OK?

40:18.304 --> 40:20.375
Cum! What?

40:20.622 --> 40:22.617
It has no sign.

40:22.702 --> 40:23.929
What do you face? Just used.

40:24.133 --> 40:25.070
Try again.

40:29.741 --> 40:31.665
Nothing!

40:31.933 --> 40:33.308
What are we going to do?

40:36.060 --> 40:37.269
Seek higher ground, right?

40:37.571 --> 40:39.804
The light turned bad since we got here.

40:40.053 --> 40:42.152
Let's go where we can make a call.

40:42.394 --> 40:43.758
Okay. Everything will be fine.

40:44.031 --> 40:45.169
OK?

40:45.456 --> 40:46.450
Trevor.

You know where you're going?

41:56.059 --> 41:57.984
Yes, I think so.

41:58.231 --> 42:00.202
This area does not seem strange.

42:00.448 --> 42:02.877
Come on, come on!

42:05.135 --> 42:06.828
Staff, walk fast.

42:07.039 --> 42:09.622
What's your problem, pal? Same as your own!

42:09.962 --> 42:11.649
We are in the woods with something chasing us.

42:11.891 --> 42:12.974
Stop fighting!

42:13.241 --> 42:15.489
Continues. Yup.

42:46.550 --> 42:48.284
Staff, the voice message from Julius.

42:50.571 --> 42:53.559
Stop cute and return me soon, man.

43:02.429 --> 43:04.554
We have to get out of here.

43:05.063 --> 43:06.202
What's going on with him?

43:06.469 --> 43:07.507
You're just scared.

43:07.844 --> 43:09.851
I'm not scared of shit.

43:11.312 --> 43:12.979
