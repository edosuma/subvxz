00:02.333 --> 00:03.875
(male narrator)
Previously on "Babylon 5.."

00:03.958 --> 00:05.958
I read four Centauri warships,
too many to fight.

00:06.042 --> 00:08.042
[gunfire]

00:13.125 --> 00:14.083
Oh, God!

00:14.167 --> 00:15.792
This is leftover

00:15.875 --> 00:17.875
Shadow technology,
Mr. President.

00:17.958 --> 00:19.583
It's an organic device

00:19.667 --> 00:22.250
used to control a ship
from a long distance.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.958
You put three or three
of these onboard a starship

00:25.042 --> 00:27.000
and you don't even need a crew.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.917
That's why we couldn't figure
out a strategy

00:29.000 --> 00:30.500
behind the random attacks.

00:30.583 --> 00:33.708
We couldn't see a goal
because there was no goal.

00:33.792 --> 00:36.208
There was no strategy
beyond alienating everyone

00:36.292 --> 00:39.625
in the Alliance, turn them
against the Centauris so that..

00:42.042 --> 00:43.667
So they'd attack!

00:43.750 --> 00:45.583
What did they ask you to do?

00:45.667 --> 00:48.333
To send away all the ships

00:48.417 --> 00:51.625
guarding Centauri Prime..

00:51.708 --> 00:53.708
...on a false emergency..

00:56.208 --> 00:57.708
...and turn off

00:57.792 --> 01:00.792
the planetary defense network.

01:00.875 --> 01:02.917
[zapping]

01:07.583 --> 01:09.625
[explosion]

01:13.458 --> 01:15.500
Dear G'Quan!

01:24.583 --> 01:26.167
G'Kar.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.167
Come.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.875
[explosions]

01:36.583 --> 01:38.708
[instrumental music]

01:41.792 --> 01:44.625
[indistinct chatter]

01:48.833 --> 01:51.750
- Aah!
- Stay here.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.042
I will call for a doctor

01:53.125 --> 01:54.625
then I have to find the regent.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.750
You will be alright.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.208
[groans]

02:05.292 --> 02:06.917
(Garibaldi)
'Mr. President, I thought
you should know.'

02:07.000 --> 02:08.708
The Narn and Drazi fleets
have begun their assault

02:08.792 --> 02:10.042
on the Centauri Homeworld.

02:10.125 --> 02:11.750
What about
the planetary defense net?

02:11.833 --> 02:13.167
Well, they're apparently down.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.708
The ships that normally
guard Centauri Prime

02:14.792 --> 02:15.875
have moved elsewhere.

02:15.958 --> 02:17.208
Somebody's left the door
wide open

02:17.292 --> 02:19.458
and our people are movin'
through it.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.583
'There's one other thing
you need to know.'

02:21.667 --> 02:23.125
We just got word.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.250
John, Delenn's White Star's been
missing for at least 12 hours.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.792
They think she might
have run into a wing

02:27.875 --> 02:29.417
of Centauri warships.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.583
[instrumental music]

02:44.542 --> 02:46.042
[electricity crackling]

02:54.333 --> 02:56.583
[zapping]

03:01.125 --> 03:02.250
Regent.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.250
[distant explosions]

03:05.333 --> 03:07.125
[instrumental music]

03:15.500 --> 03:17.167
(Regent)
'They say the bombardment'

03:17.250 --> 03:19.750
'is moving away
from the capital'

03:19.833 --> 03:21.667
into the outer areas.

03:21.750 --> 03:25.375
- We should be safe for a time.
- Madness.

03:25.458 --> 03:28.167
Our people are dying
by the thousands

03:28.250 --> 03:30.458
tens of thousands!

03:30.542 --> 03:31.958
Yes.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.583
- They say--
- Who says?

03:35.667 --> 03:37.917
Who are they?
What are you talking about?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.167
They!

03:40.250 --> 03:41.625
Say..

03:42.750 --> 03:45.583
'...it's your time now, Londo.'

03:45.667 --> 03:47.583
[dramatic music]

03:49.208 --> 03:50.958
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

03:51.042 --> 03:53.625
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

03:53.708 --> 03:58.250
(G'Kar)
No one here is
exactly what he appears.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.125
(General Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

04:00.208 --> 04:01.208
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate

04:01.292 --> 04:02.458
the entire Narn Homeworld--

04:02.542 --> 04:04.000
(Elric)
I see a great hand

04:04.083 --> 04:06.250
reaching out of the stars.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.833
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring--

04:08.917 --> 04:11.500
(John)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

04:11.583 --> 04:12.875
Unless your people
get off their

04:12.958 --> 04:14.500
encounter-suited butts
and do something.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.250
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.167
(Kosh)
If you go
to Z'ha'dum you will die.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.292
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:20.375 --> 04:22.333
Do you have anything
worth living for?

04:22.417 --> 04:23.958
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

04:24.042 --> 04:25.500
(John)
Giants in the play ground.

04:25.583 --> 04:26.625
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

04:26.708 --> 04:27.708
We are here to place

04:27.792 --> 04:30.042
President Clark under arrest.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.917
[theme music]

04:50.083 --> 04:51.917
[music continues]

05:18.333 --> 05:19.500
[instrumental music]

05:22.833 --> 05:24.833
Who..

05:24.917 --> 05:26.875
What are you?

05:26.958 --> 05:29.542
(Regent)
'They are called Drakh.'

05:31.375 --> 05:32.833
"Drakh?"

05:32.917 --> 05:34.875
I know you.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.458
You worked for the Shadows.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.042
They say..

05:40.125 --> 05:42.833
'...the Shadows
were our masters.'

05:42.917 --> 05:46.167
'We served them,
believed in them'

05:46.250 --> 05:48.875
'loved them.'

05:48.958 --> 05:52.750
Then they went away
and left us behind

05:52.833 --> 05:54.833
to escape on our own.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.875
But without our masters

05:58.958 --> 06:01.500
who are we?

06:01.583 --> 06:03.625
In the end..

06:03.708 --> 06:04.917
...what are we but--

06:05.000 --> 06:07.625
A shadow..

06:07.708 --> 06:09.625
...of a shadow.

06:09.708 --> 06:11.542
An echo

06:11.625 --> 06:14.208
of what was.

06:15.167 --> 06:19.167
Our home, Z'ha'dum, destroyed.

06:20.667 --> 06:24.875
We...wandered.

06:24.958 --> 06:30.375
Then we remembered...this place.

06:30.458 --> 06:34.125
We remembered...you.

06:36.250 --> 06:41.125
Their masters
saw great potential here.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.958
They came
in considerable numbers..

06:45.333 --> 06:49.458
...with their ships
and their associate

06:49.542 --> 06:51.667
Mr. Morden.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.167
You remember.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.625
Yes.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.167
You don't frighten me, Mollari.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.042
If you try to attack
our forces, you'll lose.

07:01.125 --> 07:04.583
Yes, your ships
are very impressive in the air

07:04.667 --> 07:06.708
or in space

07:06.792 --> 07:09.542
but at this moment,
they are on the ground.

07:09.625 --> 07:13.083
Fine. They're on the ground.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.417
But they can sense
an approaching ship miles away.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.333
So what are you going
to do, Mollari, huh?

07:17.417 --> 07:18.542
Blow up the island?

07:19.750 --> 07:21.208
Actually..

07:24.792 --> 07:27.542
...now that you mention it.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.458
No!

07:29.542 --> 07:31.583
[explosion]

07:33.667 --> 07:35.042
I remember.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.375
You just made a mistake, Londo!

07:38.458 --> 07:41.708
Even if my associates
lose this war, they have allies!

07:41.792 --> 07:44.708
They'll make sure
Centauri Prime pays the price

07:44.792 --> 07:47.292
for what you've
done here today!

07:47.375 --> 07:49.667
Allies.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.042
That would be you.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.875
Then it wasn't you
who started this war.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.500
It was them, wasn't it?

08:00.583 --> 08:02.333
You want your revenge

08:02.417 --> 08:05.000
but you don't want anyone
to know you are here.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.208
And so you used our forces

08:07.292 --> 08:09.167
to attack everyone
in the alliance.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.875
Turn them against us.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.958
And make them do your work.

08:15.042 --> 08:18.250
Yes.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.458
But what good is it
to take your revenge

08:20.542 --> 08:22.583
against innocent people?

08:22.667 --> 08:25.500
Your quarrel is with me.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.583
If you want vengeance,
I'm standing right here.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.917
Take it.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.583
They say..

08:32.667 --> 08:36.750
...they do not
want your life, Mollari.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.583
'At least, not yet.'

08:40.792 --> 08:43.333
Then what do you want?

08:43.417 --> 08:45.708
A home.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.958
Our new home.

08:53.833 --> 08:59.750
Oh! You are now
what we need you to be.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.458
'A beaten resentful people'

09:03.542 --> 09:06.875
'who will have to rebuild.'

09:06.958 --> 09:12.333
Who will have to rely
on our...good graces.

09:12.417 --> 09:16.333
Who can be used and...guided

09:16.417 --> 09:19.708
as we wish to guide you.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.958
Perfect ground

09:22.042 --> 09:24.625
for us to do our work..

09:24.708 --> 09:26.333
...quietly.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.792
Quietly.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.833
No! I will not allow it!

09:32.917 --> 09:35.458
Yes, you will.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.208
As I did.

09:37.292 --> 09:39.625
You see, Londo,
they learn quickly.

09:39.708 --> 09:41.042
They learned from the shadows

09:41.125 --> 09:43.833
and they learned from you.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.083
They've planted fusion bombs

09:45.167 --> 09:47.000
throughout Centauri Prime.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.458
Unless they get what they want

09:48.542 --> 09:51.000
millions of our people will die

09:51.083 --> 09:54.000
and the blame will
go to the alliance.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.792
In all this bombing

09:55.875 --> 09:58.583
who will notice
a few more craters?

10:00.583 --> 10:01.917
No! Wait.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.417
Don't.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.667
What do you want of me?

10:09.750 --> 10:12.333
What we want from you..

10:13.458 --> 10:15.750
...is you.

10:19.750 --> 10:23.958
(John)
'This is President Sheridan
to Narn and Drazi fleets.'

10:24.042 --> 10:26.875
You are ordered
to cease fire at once.

10:26.958 --> 10:28.875
Cease fire, or we will
target your ships

10:28.958 --> 10:31.167
and destroy them.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.917
Of course,
we'd be happy to oblige

10:33.000 --> 10:35.250
in exchange for your support.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.833
After all, you promised
to back any act

10:37.917 --> 10:39.458
we judged appropriate.

10:39.542 --> 10:42.500
I never sanctioned an attack
on Centauri Prime

10:42.583 --> 10:43.958
and you know it!

10:44.042 --> 10:45.875
I gave you strict instructions!

10:45.958 --> 10:47.500
Of course you did

10:47.583 --> 10:50.542
hence our decision
to end the war for you.

10:50.625 --> 10:53.708
'And now that we have
taken the first steps'

10:53.792 --> 10:58.208
'you can join us in the battle
with clean hands.'

10:58.292 --> 11:00.708
Negative. Won't happen.

11:00.792 --> 11:03.542
(G'Kar)
'Then we have a slight problem,
Mr. President.'

11:03.625 --> 11:06.375
You see, the ships that normally
guard Centauri Prime

11:06.458 --> 11:08.250
were called away.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.458
They will return
in two or three hours.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.500
When they arrive

11:14.583 --> 11:17.375
they will not be interested
in explanations

11:17.458 --> 11:20.417
as to what was
or was not authorized.

11:20.500 --> 11:24.833
'They will be out
for blood and revenge.'

11:24.917 --> 11:28.000
'You can either fight
beside us and live'

11:28.083 --> 11:31.375
'or hold back...and die.'

11:33.500 --> 11:35.833
'What will it be,
Mr. President?'

11:37.833 --> 11:41.500
(Regent)
'Our ships will
be returning soon, Londo.'

11:41.583 --> 11:44.250
When that happens, they will
attack Sheridan's fleet

11:44.333 --> 11:46.458
with every weapon they have

11:46.542 --> 11:49.167
and Centauri Prime
will pay the price

11:49.250 --> 11:50.625
in more dead.

11:50.708 --> 11:53.542
We have no interest
in fighting the alliance.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.750
Issue the surrender order.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.167
I can't.

11:57.250 --> 12:01.333
You see, I'm your alibi.

12:01.417 --> 12:04.542
'You will say
that I was quite mad'

12:04.625 --> 12:06.750
and that I gave
the attack orders

12:06.833 --> 12:08.417
without the knowledge
of yourself

12:08.500 --> 12:11.792
or anyone else
in the government.

12:11.875 --> 12:15.167
Then you can give
the order to surrender.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.750
I don't have the authority.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.167
You will.

12:20.250 --> 12:25.792
Because I will be dead,
and you will be emperor.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.167
It's all very clean that way.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.083
Once I'm gone you can blame me

12:31.167 --> 12:33.042
for anything you want.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.542
I won't mind, really.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.333
Because I'll know..

12:39.417 --> 12:42.500
...you had no choice.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.542
No choice at all.

12:45.792 --> 12:48.083
What do you mean, no choice?

12:59.125 --> 13:01.000
Look at me, Londo.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.042
'Look closely.'

13:06.917 --> 13:10.500
'You can't see it
until it chooses to be seen.'

13:12.250 --> 13:13.583
Great maker.

13:15.417 --> 13:16.625
What is it?

13:16.708 --> 13:19.208
It's called a keeper.

13:19.292 --> 13:22.042
They become a part of you.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.083
They can control you

13:24.167 --> 13:27.125
but only when their interests
are at stake.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.542
'You will be free
to do as you wish'

13:29.625 --> 13:32.125
'the rest of the time.'

13:32.208 --> 13:35.708
I live...only as long

13:35.792 --> 13:38.042
as it is part of me.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.750
I have to go now, Londo.

13:43.833 --> 13:47.208
No...don't go.

13:47.292 --> 13:50.500
I have been many things
in my life, Mollari.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.833
I have been silly.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.583
I have been quiet
when I should have spoken.

14:00.167 --> 14:02.625
I have been foolish.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.458
And I have wasted

14:04.542 --> 14:07.792
far too much time.

14:10.125 --> 14:12.292
But I am still Centauri..

14:14.167 --> 14:15.833
...and I am not afraid.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.417
[dramatic music]

14:43.208 --> 14:45.708
Distance to Centauri fleet?

14:45.792 --> 14:48.458
Centauri warships will be
within optimum firing range

14:48.542 --> 14:52.167
in 20 standard minutes.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.625
Do we prepare to engage?

14:55.417 --> 14:56.625
Mr. President?

15:00.792 --> 15:02.292
Negative. Negative.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.792
We will not engage.

15:06.708 --> 15:07.667
Get me Centauri Prime.

15:07.750 --> 15:08.792
There must be someone there

15:08.875 --> 15:10.333
that I can talk to.

15:10.417 --> 15:11.667
They're not responding.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.083
Well, keep sending.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.583
And try Delenn's ship again.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.167
Divert all White Stars
in that area to search for her.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.167
I want that ship found.

15:24.042 --> 15:26.500
Do you know how much time
we have left on life support?

15:28.208 --> 15:30.500
It's hard to say.

15:30.583 --> 15:31.875
Meaning you do not know

15:31.958 --> 15:34.208
or you do not wish to say?

15:35.750 --> 15:37.750
Meaning..

15:37.833 --> 15:39.750
...perhaps it is better
not to know.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.250
It is, however, a moot point.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.875
Our navigational thrusters
will be out of fuel soon.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.333
Once we're off the beacon
we'll be caught

15:48.417 --> 15:50.208
in the hyperspace currents.

15:52.917 --> 15:55.625
I'm sorry, Delenn.

15:55.708 --> 15:58.750
There's nothing
you could have done, Lennier.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.292
Nothing at all.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.583
No, no, no, no. Sit. Sit.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.333
I can't stay.

16:13.417 --> 16:15.292
I just wanted
to see how you were.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.750
Better.

16:17.833 --> 16:20.750
I would be dead
if not for you.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.083
You risked your life
to save mine.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.708
Yes. You would have
done the same.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.917
Yes, but I am a better person.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.958
You ingrate.

16:30.042 --> 16:33.167
I promised I would get you
out of that cell, yes?

16:33.250 --> 16:35.417
Do I not keep my promises, hmm?

16:35.500 --> 16:36.917
[chuckles]

16:37.000 --> 16:38.917
Where you go, I go.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.208
(G'Kar)
'Yes. Ha, ha!

16:43.500 --> 16:47.875
That must now...change, however.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.792
I cannot have you
following me around

16:52.875 --> 16:54.833
as my bodyguard any longer.

16:54.917 --> 16:57.542
I do not think it would be
appropriate or safe.

16:57.625 --> 17:01.292
- Why not?
- The regent is dead, G'Kar.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.292
In a few moments
I will take his place.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.917
They are..

17:07.000 --> 17:08.792
...preparing for me now.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.000
And although I cannot formally

17:12.083 --> 17:14.042
become emperor until tomorrow

17:14.125 --> 17:16.458
when the Centaurum meets..

17:16.542 --> 17:18.750
...unofficially.

17:18.833 --> 17:22.042
I am now in charge.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.542
'After tonight..'

17:28.625 --> 17:31.792
'...I don't know that I will
ever see you again'

17:31.875 --> 17:35.125
and...I wanted to..

17:41.583 --> 17:43.125
...to say goodbye.

17:45.292 --> 17:48.083
I don't know why that should be
important to me now

17:48.167 --> 17:50.167
at a time like this, but it is.

17:53.750 --> 17:57.125
In the months
and the years to come

17:57.208 --> 18:01.208
you may hear many strange things
about me, my behavior.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.292
Well, they say the position..

18:08.125 --> 18:09.667
...changes you.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.042
And I just..

18:15.542 --> 18:17.458
I-I wanted to..

18:17.542 --> 18:19.333
I understand.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.667
Perhaps.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.708
And perhaps
you do not understand

18:27.792 --> 18:30.167
as much as you think.

18:30.250 --> 18:34.167
Pray that you never do, G'Kar.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.417
Pray that you never
truly understand.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.833
[pats]

18:43.917 --> 18:45.625
Well, I must hurry.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.292
[sighs]
Our ships will soon be
in firing range.

18:57.125 --> 19:00.208
Isn't it strange, G'Kar?

19:00.292 --> 19:02.708
When we first met

19:02.792 --> 19:05.458
I had no power

19:05.542 --> 19:09.042
and all the choices
I could ever want.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.375
And now I have all the power
I could ever want.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.042
And no choices at all.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.083
No choice at all.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.000
(G'Kar)
'Mollari.'

19:37.250 --> 19:39.292
Understand..

19:39.375 --> 19:42.292
...that I can never
forgive your people

19:42.375 --> 19:44.375
for what they did
to my world.

19:46.125 --> 19:49.625
'My people can never
forgive your people.'

19:52.333 --> 19:54.500
But I..

19:54.583 --> 19:58.250
...can forgive...you.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.500
[instrumental music]

20:27.708 --> 20:29.542
[music continues]

20:43.875 --> 20:45.083
I'm ready.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.500
[instrumental music]

21:53.958 --> 21:55.625
No reply
from Delenn's White Star

21:55.708 --> 21:57.542
Mr. President.

21:57.625 --> 22:00.708
Should we abandon our position
and join the search?

22:02.792 --> 22:04.208
Mr. President?

22:06.375 --> 22:08.417
No.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.500
How far until the Centauri
hit optimum firing range?

22:11.583 --> 22:12.708
Five minutes.

22:12.792 --> 22:14.625
[dramatic music]

22:21.917 --> 22:23.958
Picking up a transmission
from Centauri Prime

22:24.042 --> 22:26.250
to the approaching fleet ships.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.375
(John)
'What are they saying?'

22:27.458 --> 22:28.750
It's encrypted.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.500
Could be an attack order,
could be anything.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.208
Come on, talk to me.

22:33.292 --> 22:35.667
I'm getting the sound
of angry voices, sir.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.417
An argument of some kind.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.958
It stopped.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.250
Position of Centauri fleet?

22:42.333 --> 22:44.250
They're..

22:44.333 --> 22:46.375
...holding position.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.917
Not advancing any further.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.958
Picking up another signal
from Centauri Prime.

22:51.042 --> 22:53.000
[beeping]

22:53.083 --> 22:55.458
It's for you.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.750
Put it through.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.125
Mr. President.

23:01.208 --> 23:02.542
I don't know if you've been

23:02.625 --> 23:04.583
monitoring our transmissions,
but--

23:04.667 --> 23:05.958
(Londo)
'I have.'

23:06.042 --> 23:07.292
I accept you at your word

23:07.375 --> 23:10.083
that this terrible assault
on our world

23:10.167 --> 23:12.042
was not sanctioned by you

23:12.125 --> 23:13.958
because we find ourselves

23:14.042 --> 23:16.583
in a much similar situation.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.958
The attack on the alliance
shipping lanes

23:19.042 --> 23:21.292
which precipitated this war

23:21.375 --> 23:24.292
were not authorized
by the Centaurum.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.958
They were done
under the express orders

23:26.042 --> 23:27.375
of the regent.

23:27.458 --> 23:28.875
He acted alone.

23:28.958 --> 23:32.208
- And where is the Regent?
- Dead.

23:32.292 --> 23:33.958
I would say..

23:34.042 --> 23:36.625
...that his hearts gave out.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.333
I am in charge here now.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.292
Then you will give
the recall order?

23:40.375 --> 23:43.292
Our ships have been told
to ignore any message

23:43.375 --> 23:46.458
which does not come in
at exactly specified times.

23:46.542 --> 23:50.583
As they check in,
we will give the recall order.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.333
There is no longer any reason
for us to fight.

23:55.958 --> 23:58.458
Then this is over.

23:58.542 --> 24:01.167
I don't think our military
will be very happy about it

24:01.250 --> 24:04.458
but yes. This is now over.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.625
Then I would like to come down
and talk to you directly.

24:08.583 --> 24:09.875
There's something
that I need you to do.

24:09.958 --> 24:11.958
That might not be wise.

24:12.042 --> 24:15.208
Our people may not take
kindly to your presence.

24:15.292 --> 24:16.750
I'll take that chance.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.625
It's about Delenn.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.375
Her ship is missing in action.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.750
Very well.

24:27.833 --> 24:30.417
I will make sure you are met
at the space port

24:30.500 --> 24:33.708
'and brought here
as soon as you land.'

24:33.792 --> 24:35.083
Thank you.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.750
[instrumental music]

24:37.833 --> 24:39.500
What happened to Delenn?

24:46.458 --> 24:48.000
No.

24:48.083 --> 24:49.167
No. I ask you.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.833
I beg of you not to do this.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.750
There is nothing to be gained
in killing her.

24:54.833 --> 24:56.833
[dramatic music]

24:59.458 --> 25:00.542
And the last position
we have on Delenn's ship

25:00.625 --> 25:02.750
puts her about two jumps
from Minbar.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.583
Now, the grey council
has half their fleet

25:04.667 --> 25:06.167
out looking for her
but you know

25:06.250 --> 25:07.667
what hyperspace is like.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.042
It's like trying to find
a needle in a haystack

25:10.125 --> 25:11.750
in the middle of a tornado.

25:11.833 --> 25:13.875
Now we need to know
the exact location

25:13.958 --> 25:16.250
the-the attack on her ship
took place.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.333
Well, that may be difficult.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.417
As I said,
we cannot contact our ships

25:20.500 --> 25:22.208
except at predetermined times.

25:22.292 --> 25:23.625
I understand.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.125
All I'm asking is that you do
whatever you can.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.042
Of course.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.125
Though, if I do this for you

25:30.208 --> 25:33.667
I may someday come to you
and ask for a favor in return.

25:33.750 --> 25:35.792
Londo, she's your friend, too.

25:35.875 --> 25:39.167
Our world has been
savagely attacked by your people

25:39.250 --> 25:40.583
and you call us friends?

25:40.667 --> 25:42.583
Yes. We can still
help each other.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.667
Absolutely not.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.417
The Centauri Republic
will have nothing more

25:46.500 --> 25:49.292
to do with this,
this alliance of yours.

25:49.375 --> 25:52.042
We will raise ourselves
back to what we once were

25:52.125 --> 25:53.708
'without your help.'

25:53.792 --> 25:55.792
If I give you
back Delenn's life

25:55.875 --> 25:58.000
it will be an act
of charity, nothing more.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.333
Do you understand me?

26:01.208 --> 26:02.458
Yes.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.542
I will, however, remind you

26:05.625 --> 26:07.583
that as the losing party
in this war

26:07.667 --> 26:10.333
you will make reparations
to the alliance worlds

26:10.417 --> 26:13.792
that your ships attacked.

26:13.875 --> 26:16.042
We may be able
to mitigate that slightly.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.708
Oh?

26:17.792 --> 26:19.125
We believe that most
of your ships

26:19.208 --> 26:21.542
engaged in hostile actions

26:21.625 --> 26:23.333
were under the control
of some kind

26:23.417 --> 26:25.667
of leftover Shadow technology.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.333
We found some semi-organic pods

26:29.417 --> 26:31.167
that control the ships
long distance.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.500
Yes. I am aware of them.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.500
The Regent bought them
on the black market

26:35.583 --> 26:36.792
as insurance against mutiny.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.917
- Old news.
- But why didn't you--

26:39.000 --> 26:41.500
if you want us
to find Delenn for you

26:41.583 --> 26:43.958
I suggest you allow us
to do it

26:44.042 --> 26:46.000
before one of our
other ships finds her

26:46.083 --> 26:48.250
and finishes
what the first one started.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.667
That's the last
of the navigational thrusters.

26:55.083 --> 26:57.458
Starting now, we'll drift
further off the beacon.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.833
Perhaps it's not so bad
to go off the beacon.

27:04.667 --> 27:07.125
No one knows what's out there.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.208
Maybe we'll find
a million-year-old jumpgate

27:10.292 --> 27:12.125
left behind by the first ones.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.125
That would be amazing

27:16.208 --> 27:18.750
wouldn't it, Lennier?

27:18.833 --> 27:21.250
Yes.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.792
I would, of course,
expect you to get it working

27:23.875 --> 27:25.125
in a timely fashion.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.208
- I will do my best.
- Good.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.250
[Lennier sighs]

27:32.333 --> 27:35.417
Minbar should have reported
our disappearance by now.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.958
I don't understand
why they're not looking for us.

27:38.042 --> 27:40.375
I'm sure they are.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.583
But nothing works the way
it should out here.

27:44.167 --> 27:46.417
We are far away

27:46.500 --> 27:49.417
and far between.

27:49.500 --> 27:53.208
(Lennier)
'There is one other thing
we could do, Delenn.'

27:53.292 --> 27:56.500
Our weapons system
is still barely functional.

27:56.583 --> 27:59.250
If there are any ships
in the area looking for us

27:59.333 --> 28:01.458
firing the weapons
could attract them.

28:03.167 --> 28:05.583
It could also attract
the Centauri warships

28:05.667 --> 28:07.042
that attacked.

28:08.292 --> 28:10.792
Either way the recoil
from the discharge

28:10.875 --> 28:12.875
would push us further off
the beacon.

28:14.542 --> 28:15.750
I see.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.917
[dramatic music]

28:20.250 --> 28:21.917
Which control?

28:25.750 --> 28:28.958
(Lennier)
'Green then red twice.'

28:29.042 --> 28:31.167
"Green..

28:31.250 --> 28:32.458
...then red.."

28:32.542 --> 28:34.000
Twice.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.583
[zapping]

28:43.125 --> 28:45.042
That would appear
to be all we had left.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.458
Yes.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.583
So it would seem.

28:51.583 --> 28:53.125
[beeping]

28:53.208 --> 28:54.792
What?

28:54.875 --> 28:56.375
(Lennier)
'That's a proximity alert.'

28:56.458 --> 28:57.625
Something's coming.

28:57.708 --> 28:59.750
[beeping]

29:06.875 --> 29:09.083
We seem to have attracted
the wrong kind of attention.

29:09.167 --> 29:11.417
[dramatic music]

29:22.583 --> 29:24.000
[beeping]

29:24.083 --> 29:25.708
That's the power monitor.

29:25.792 --> 29:27.917
It tracks their weapon system.

29:29.167 --> 29:32.417
When the beeping
becomes a steady tone

29:32.500 --> 29:33.500
they'll have reached critical

29:33.583 --> 29:34.875
and can fire their weapons.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.083
[whirring]

29:40.167 --> 29:42.417
Coded transmission.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.333
They're probably confirming
the kill shot

29:44.417 --> 29:46.208
with Centauri Prime.

29:46.292 --> 29:48.208
[beeping accelerates]

29:49.583 --> 29:50.833
(Lennier)
'Delenn.'

29:50.917 --> 29:52.667
Yes?

29:55.125 --> 29:56.542
I love you.

29:58.500 --> 29:59.917
I know.

30:07.667 --> 30:09.292
[instrumental music]

30:26.542 --> 30:27.833
[sighs]

30:30.417 --> 30:32.708
Lennier.

30:32.792 --> 30:34.125
You said something
a moment ago.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.583
I didn't actually hear it.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.167
The power monitor, you see.

30:38.250 --> 30:41.250
It was making
a great deal of noise.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.792
Nothing, I-I..

30:42.875 --> 30:44.333
I said nothing.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.750
Ah, well..

30:50.500 --> 30:52.292
At times of great stress

30:52.375 --> 30:54.875
one can say things
one did not intend to say

30:54.958 --> 30:58.000
would never have said
under other circumstances.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.958
I don't think anyone
should be held to that

31:00.042 --> 31:03.250
or asked to explain or..

31:03.333 --> 31:05.583
Well, that's neither here

31:05.667 --> 31:07.875
nor there, as the humans say.

31:11.167 --> 31:12.292
Lennier..

31:12.375 --> 31:13.833
...look at me.

31:18.292 --> 31:21.125
Nothing happened..

31:21.208 --> 31:24.292
...except that, for a moment..

31:24.375 --> 31:27.167
...I found myself feeling
extremely complimented.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.667
And deeply honored..

31:30.750 --> 31:32.000
...by your presence..

31:34.292 --> 31:35.542
...and by your friendship.

31:44.208 --> 31:46.542
So..

31:46.625 --> 31:48.792
...when they bring us
back to Centauri Prime..

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
...do you think we'll have
to fight our way out of this?

31:55.333 --> 31:58.250
For their sake, I hope not.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.333
Excuse me, oh,
excuse me, I'm pard..

32:08.417 --> 32:11.375
Could you tell me have you seen
the-the prime minister?

32:11.458 --> 32:14.250
The Londo? Have you seen
the prime minister?

32:20.958 --> 32:22.375
- Londo.
- What is wrong with you?

32:22.458 --> 32:23.625
But I--

32:23.708 --> 32:25.333
Never burst in on me
without knocking!

32:25.417 --> 32:27.667
Do you understand?
Never do this again!

32:27.750 --> 32:30.292
- But I've always--
- Do you understand?

32:33.125 --> 32:34.292
Yes.

32:35.833 --> 32:38.125
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

32:38.208 --> 32:41.042
Now, what are you doing here?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.458
What are you talking about?

32:42.542 --> 32:43.708
I came as soon as I heard.

32:43.792 --> 32:46.875
I wanted to see
if you were alright.

32:46.958 --> 32:50.208
I'm, uh, fine, Vir.

32:50.292 --> 32:51.625
Just fine.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.375
I thought you'd be
in the royal suite by now.

32:54.458 --> 32:56.208
No.

32:56.292 --> 32:58.333
Not until after
the inauguration.

33:00.292 --> 33:01.792
And I am in no rush.

33:03.958 --> 33:05.833
Have you seen the damage?

33:08.417 --> 33:11.542
We still don't have a count
on all the dead and wounded.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.875
How am I supposed to live
in the royal suite

33:13.958 --> 33:16.292
and look out at all of that?

33:16.375 --> 33:17.542
You could always board
up the windows.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.292
[chuckles]

33:23.500 --> 33:26.792
I suppose they told you
the terms of our surrender, hmm?

33:26.875 --> 33:28.250
Yes, they did

33:28.333 --> 33:30.250
but if we pay the damages
that they want

33:30.333 --> 33:32.417
there won't be enough money
to rebuild.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.750
I know, but we have
no choice, Vir.

33:35.833 --> 33:37.750
No choice at all.

33:37.833 --> 33:39.583
It's what must be.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.875
The people won't stand for it.

33:41.958 --> 33:44.375
They're tired,
resentful, and angry

33:44.458 --> 33:45.917
angry at what has happened

33:46.000 --> 33:49.292
angry at the alliance,
at you, at everyone.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.667
They were right.
They got what they wanted.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.375
Who?

33:56.875 --> 33:59.417
Nothing. No one.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.583
You will calm them down,
of course

34:01.667 --> 34:03.833
help them see
what needs to be done

34:03.917 --> 34:05.667
and then make them understand.

34:07.083 --> 34:09.292
Yes, I will talk with them.

34:09.375 --> 34:10.708
Are the others here?

34:10.792 --> 34:12.083
I passed them in the hallway.

34:12.167 --> 34:14.958
I almost knocked G'Kar over.

34:15.042 --> 34:16.917
Then we should
get this over with.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.292
Are you sure you're alright?

34:18.375 --> 34:21.208
I'm fine. Just tired,
that's all.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.917
With all that's happened
I don't feel

34:23.000 --> 34:24.958
I could miss
Londo's inauguration.

34:25.042 --> 34:26.458
It may be our one chance

34:26.542 --> 34:29.417
to get the new administration
off to a good start.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.125
(Londo)
'Citizens of Centauri Prime.'

34:32.208 --> 34:33.833
- Where is..
- Outside.

34:33.917 --> 34:37.292
I'd heard he was going
to address the people.

34:37.375 --> 34:41.125
(Londo)
'We have come
through the long night'

34:41.208 --> 34:45.292
'of fire, pain, and death.'

34:45.375 --> 34:48.000
We have been gravely wounded

34:48.083 --> 34:51.333
but we remain Centauri.

34:51.417 --> 34:54.000
The Regent began
the war with the alliance

34:54.083 --> 34:57.333
and that war is now over.

34:57.417 --> 35:02.125
The greater one,
the war to rebuild our world

35:02.208 --> 35:06.500
and restore our place
in the galaxy now begins.

35:07.750 --> 35:10.542
'Sheridan and his alliance'

35:10.625 --> 35:14.000
'have struck deeply
at our people'

35:14.083 --> 35:16.000
'exacting a terrible price'

35:16.083 --> 35:18.250
'in the lives of those who died'

35:18.333 --> 35:20.625
'during the night.'

35:20.708 --> 35:24.000
Another great price
must now be paid

35:24.083 --> 35:26.167
in the form of reparations

35:26.250 --> 35:29.500
which will come close
to ruining our economy.

35:30.833 --> 35:34.250
They wish to teach us a lesson

35:34.333 --> 35:36.583
to break us

35:36.667 --> 35:41.333
so that we will never again
be a problem.

35:41.417 --> 35:42.542
Uh-oh.

35:42.625 --> 35:45.542
This punishment is unfair

35:45.625 --> 35:48.708
is a violation
of our sovereign rights

35:48.792 --> 35:52.500
but we will bear this burden

35:52.583 --> 35:54.917
as we have borne
so many before.

35:56.292 --> 35:59.667
We are no longer
a part of the alliance.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.667
We are alone.

36:01.750 --> 36:05.917
We fought alone,
and we will rebuild alone.

36:07.292 --> 36:09.625
We will work even harder

36:09.708 --> 36:13.208
'to show those who have come
to humiliate us'

36:13.292 --> 36:16.042
'that we will not bow down.'

36:19.500 --> 36:22.917
As a symbol
of our new isolationism

36:23.000 --> 36:25.292
I will walk alone

36:25.375 --> 36:27.833
to my inauguration.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.125
I will take on the burden

36:29.208 --> 36:31.792
of emperor in silence.

36:31.875 --> 36:36.167
The bells of our temples
will sound all day

36:36.250 --> 36:38.250
and all night

36:38.333 --> 36:40.417
once for each of our people

36:40.500 --> 36:43.292
killed in the bombings.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.750
We are alone.

36:45.833 --> 36:47.792
Alone in the universe..

36:49.250 --> 36:50.833
...but we are united..

36:50.917 --> 36:52.167
...in our pain.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.125
May the great maker
be with you all.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.375
Did you hear?

37:00.458 --> 37:01.708
(Vir)
'Yes.'

37:01.792 --> 37:04.000
I thought he was going
to calm people down

37:04.083 --> 37:05.958
not turn them
against us.

37:06.042 --> 37:07.458
I don't understand it myself

37:07.542 --> 37:10.542
but I'm sure he has
a very good reason for it.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.500
(Londo)
'My reasons are my own.'

37:17.667 --> 37:19.042
In light of what
you have just seen

37:19.125 --> 37:22.458
I do not think it would be
prudent for you

37:22.542 --> 37:23.958
to be at the inauguration.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.583
Any of you.

37:25.667 --> 37:28.417
I cannot guarantee your safety
if you insist on coming.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.125
That's alright.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.292
It's been a difficult time
for all of us.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.208
If you would rather this was
a closed ceremony--

37:34.292 --> 37:35.792
I would.

37:35.875 --> 37:37.833
Vir, you will go with them.

37:37.917 --> 37:40.417
- But I--
- Delenn, Mr. President.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.583
As my first official act

37:42.667 --> 37:44.667
I am formally
appointing Vir Cotto

37:44.750 --> 37:46.542
as ambassador to Babylon 5.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.458
I have every confidence
that he will do

37:49.542 --> 37:52.958
at least as good a job as I did.

37:53.042 --> 37:54.542
Londo, are you sure?

37:54.625 --> 37:58.792
Vir, I have never been surer
of anything in my life.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.875
Go now, quickly.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.542
You should not be here.

38:03.417 --> 38:06.000
None of you should be here.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.458
Go on.

38:07.542 --> 38:09.708
We will talk again
when things calm down.

38:09.792 --> 38:11.250
Alright.

38:11.333 --> 38:13.167
Check in with you when we get
back to Babylon 5

38:13.250 --> 38:14.500
and see how things are going.

38:14.583 --> 38:17.375
- If we can help--
- Thank you.

38:17.458 --> 38:18.958
Lennier wanted me to thank you

38:19.042 --> 38:21.625
on his behalf and mine
for saving us.

38:22.958 --> 38:24.750
I find..

38:24.833 --> 38:28.208
I can no longer see
the road you're on, Londo.

38:28.292 --> 38:30.958
There is a darkness around you.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.292
'I can only pray that in time'

38:33.375 --> 38:34.667
'you may find your way
out of it.'

38:59.042 --> 39:00.833
Vir, tell them..

39:02.875 --> 39:04.667
Tell them that I am ready.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.583
[instrumental music]

39:12.375 --> 39:14.417
[bell tolling]

39:16.083 --> 39:18.000
[bell tolling]

39:19.417 --> 39:21.500
[instrumental music]

39:34.542 --> 39:36.625
[dramatic music]

39:43.708 --> 39:45.625
[bell tolling]

40:16.292 --> 40:19.000
So this is
the Shadow technology

40:19.083 --> 40:21.625
they used to control
the Centauri warships.

40:21.708 --> 40:22.833
Yes.

40:22.917 --> 40:24.083
It's not as efficient as some

40:24.167 --> 40:26.208
of their other techniques.

40:26.292 --> 40:28.625
Yeah, like using humans
for living control systems

40:28.708 --> 40:29.667
for their main ships.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.500
(Lyta)
'Exactly.'

40:31.583 --> 40:33.583
Isn't there a way
we can follow up on this?

40:33.667 --> 40:35.125
No.

40:35.208 --> 40:36.500
Londo says the Regent
bought this stuff

40:36.583 --> 40:38.333
on the black market.

40:38.417 --> 40:41.000
Maybe that's true.
Maybe it isn't.

40:41.083 --> 40:43.375
Either way, it dead-ends
our investigation.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.167
Well, I know one thing.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.417
This little device scares me

40:46.500 --> 40:48.958
more than anything
I've ever seen.

40:49.042 --> 40:51.167
Not for what it is,
but what it represents.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.958
You ever been out
to see the San Diego ruins?

40:55.042 --> 40:57.000
Well, I have.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.542
The thermonuclear device

40:58.625 --> 41:00.500
used by the terrorists
to blow up San Diego

41:00.583 --> 41:02.083
could be traced right
back to the breakup

41:02.167 --> 41:05.500
of the Soviet Union
in the late 20th century.

41:05.583 --> 41:07.042
When they fell,
all of their weapons

41:07.125 --> 41:08.667
ended up in the hands
of smaller governments

41:08.750 --> 41:11.167
who didn't understand them

41:11.250 --> 41:12.625
sure as hell couldn't build them

41:12.708 --> 41:14.625
but were eminently
willing to use them.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.167
The great thing about war

41:17.250 --> 41:20.458
is that it advances technology.

41:20.542 --> 41:21.708
Bad thing about war is that most

41:21.792 --> 41:23.917
of those technologies
are destructive.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.875
'Once the war is over,
those weapons are still around.'

41:26.958 --> 41:29.500
Weapons like us.

41:29.583 --> 41:32.500
(Stephen)
'Yes. Weapons like telepaths.'

41:32.583 --> 41:34.375
And that thing there

41:34.458 --> 41:36.375
and anything else
that may have gotten out.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.375
Now, we know
that the, uh, Shadows

41:38.458 --> 41:40.125
had hundreds of allies
working for them

41:40.208 --> 41:42.208
and we know that most
of them or all of them

41:42.292 --> 41:43.917
got out before
Z'ha'dum exploded.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.208
Now, who knows
what they took with 'em

41:46.292 --> 41:48.083
and how much of it is
in the hands of people

41:48.167 --> 41:50.083
who don't understand it.

41:50.167 --> 41:51.917
Couldn't build it

41:52.000 --> 41:53.292
but are willing to use it?

41:53.375 --> 41:55.417
The giants have left
the playground

41:55.500 --> 41:59.083
but they left their guns behind.

41:59.167 --> 42:01.042
Alright, what about
the Vorlon Homeworld?

42:01.125 --> 42:02.333
Maybe they left something behind

42:02.417 --> 42:04.417
that we can use
to our own advantage.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.333
Over a dozen ships
have been sent there

42:06.417 --> 42:09.000
by various governments
since the Vorlons left.

42:09.083 --> 42:11.417
They were all destroyed
by the automatic defense systems

42:11.500 --> 42:13.833
before they even got close.

42:13.917 --> 42:17.292
The Vorlon Homeworld
is off-limits until we're ready

42:17.375 --> 42:20.208
until we've earned
the right to go there

42:20.292 --> 42:22.292
a million years from now.

42:25.250 --> 42:26.292
Don't ask, I don't know where

42:26.375 --> 42:28.750
that came from any more
than you do.

42:28.833 --> 42:30.333
I just..

42:30.417 --> 42:31.792
...know it.

42:34.875 --> 42:37.167
[clears throat]
Excuse me.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.583
Mr. President, the captain
thought you should know

42:39.667 --> 42:40.792
that the fighting here
on the station

42:40.875 --> 42:42.292
has pretty much stopped.

42:42.375 --> 42:44.208
The Centauri surrender took most

42:44.292 --> 42:45.833
of the wind out of things.

42:45.917 --> 42:47.667
Good. Good.

42:47.750 --> 42:50.500
So why the long faces?

42:50.583 --> 42:52.167
Things are quiet,
the attacks have stopped

42:52.250 --> 42:54.417
we won the Centauri war.
What's the problem?

42:54.500 --> 42:57.708
Yes, we won the war

42:57.792 --> 42:59.583
but what did we lose?

43:01.125 --> 43:04.167
[mellow music]

43:31.875 --> 43:34.000
[theme music]
