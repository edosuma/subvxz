WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:03.535
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.537
Henriette: How did
we die, mother?
She suffocated you.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.373
Do to claude
what she did to us.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.375
If you don't do it,
then we will,

00:09.377 --> 00:10.509
<i>And she will suffer.</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:12.444
Forgive me.
You're burning up.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.715
The brand of the
three dark riders.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.317
<i>They wanted me to know</i>
<i>that whenever they choose,</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:19.351
<i>They can lift up my shirt</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:20.386
And demonize me.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.387
Antoine.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.688
Antoine:
Little brother.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.324
Your reports have grown briefer.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.092
And fewer.
Why is that?

00:27.094 --> 00:28.327
Conde:
I know I agreed to marry claude

00:28.329 --> 00:29.328
<i>On behalf of France,</i>

00:29.330 --> 00:31.063
But I've realized I can't.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.364
<i>I've fallen in love</i>
<i>with a queen.</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:33.799
(muffled screaming)

00:33.801 --> 00:35.267
You blame me for
what happened.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.503
I believe that we should
lead separate lives.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.406
Hang them all

00:40.408 --> 00:42.408
<i>Here in the courtyard, so the</i>
<i>others can see what fate has</i>

00:42.410 --> 00:44.410
<i>In store for those who would</i>
<i>rise against us.</i>

00:46.413 --> 00:49.081
Man:
Go on, take it back now.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.549
Man 2:
Yeah, how much longer?
It's freezing.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.618
Careful with that one.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.558
(kissing and moaning)

01:03.496 --> 01:06.498
I just can't stop thinking
about your sister.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.434
Kenna...

01:08.436 --> 01:10.736
I know she wasn't well, you were
just taking her to her chamber.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.738
I don't know why I
keep dwelling on it.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.073
Then don't.

01:17.777 --> 01:22.748
It's just, claude is so pretty
and so adventurous.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.783
She was in your arms...

01:24.785 --> 01:26.785
Kenna, please
not now.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.154
It's so silly of me
to be so jealous.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.090
She's your sister.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.425
Half sister.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.426
What?

01:34.428 --> 01:35.594
Just being accurate.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.662
We have different
mothers.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.467
Let's not talk
about our families.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.402
(knocking on door)

01:43.404 --> 01:44.536
Man: An urgent
matter, my lord.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.172
Orders were to
display the traitors

01:47.174 --> 01:48.674
For two weeks,
then cut them down.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.542
The good thing about this
cold, there's barely...

01:50.544 --> 01:51.844
Get to the point.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.479
Well, some of them,
their clothes are torn.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.647
You know how it is, my lord,
the birds come and peck...

01:55.649 --> 01:56.648
I know.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.150
So we saw it.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.785
Checked every body,
it's the same.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.722
It's in the same place on each
traitor who stormed the castle.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.525
Bash: Looks like the mark
of the dark riders.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.762
Cardinal perazzo.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.165
Cardinal vasari told us rumors
of these dark riders,

02:13.167 --> 02:14.867
But he thought it
a tale for the credulous.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.869
What do you
think happened?

02:16.871 --> 02:18.470
The dead men are
all protestant traitors.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.538
They all bear a mark.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.340
Must be some secret seal,

02:21.342 --> 02:22.608
A pledge amongst
their brotherhood.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.643
You make a great deal
of sense, your eminence.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.546
They must have made up this
story of the dark riders

02:27.548 --> 02:30.916
To cover their tracks,
should anyone spy the brand.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.818
I'll send my swiss guard to
discover these traitors among us

02:32.820 --> 02:34.153
And root them out.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.721
Forgive me,
your eminence,

02:35.723 --> 02:37.422
But this is a matter
for the king's justice,

02:37.424 --> 02:39.291
And as I am the
king's deputy,

02:39.293 --> 02:41.293
I assure you I
will handle it.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.461
After I gather
evidence.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.663
My son,

02:44.665 --> 02:47.299
These men are
religious extremists,

02:47.301 --> 02:49.568
Answerable to the
ecclesiastical courts.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.436
You're telling me
to step aside?

02:51.438 --> 02:53.438
Speak to your brother, the king.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.875
You'll find he has no wish
to challenge the pope.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.415
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

03:05.852 --> 03:08.587
â™ª they all need something

03:08.589 --> 03:13.458
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

03:13.460 --> 03:16.728
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

03:16.730 --> 03:20.666
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

03:20.668 --> 03:23.802
â™ª

03:31.678 --> 03:33.345
(knocking on door)

03:35.481 --> 03:36.715
Excuse me.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.717
Castle is freezing,

03:38.719 --> 03:41.753
And, as I suspected,
your hearth's gone cold.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.755
I'll only be a moment.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.425
How long are you going to keep
playing this game?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.759
I don't understand.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.595
I told you that we would
lead separate lives.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.963
And yet, every day or two,

03:50.965 --> 03:53.932
You come here with something
to keep me more comfortable.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.301
You don't say anything,

03:56.303 --> 03:57.970
But I can feel you
pressing me to talk.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.504
You're wrong.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.973
I don't expect you to talk to me

04:00.975 --> 04:02.841
Or do anything
you don't wish to do.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.247
I was thinking, it might be good
to get away from the castle

04:08.249 --> 04:09.948
For a while--
away from the memories.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.551
I haven't yet visited
our chÃ¢teau in chambord.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.988
Well, that sounds like
a very good idea.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.990
I'll come with you,
to make sure you're safe.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.424
I prefer to go alone.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.593
Don't you see,
francis?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.596
If we go together,
it will only give you hope.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.565
Hope that things will return
to the way they were.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.568
I don't have hope.

04:29.570 --> 04:33.272
I know that I'm a constant
reminder of what happened.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.576
Additional guards then,
to accompany you.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.778
I'll see to it.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.549
Your eminence, I've come
to discuss the branded men.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.351
The matter is in hand.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.586
Public notices
displaying the brand

04:47.588 --> 04:50.889
My men are there
to encourage neighbor

04:50.891 --> 04:52.824
To speak out against neighbor.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.826
Yes, but, as it happens,
I'm not convinced

04:54.828 --> 04:57.663
The bodies weren't marked
after death.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.665
Someone may be deliberately
linking the brand

04:59.667 --> 05:01.633
With protestants,
using it to fan the flames

05:01.635 --> 05:03.702
Of hate toward them.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.903
(knocking on door)

05:04.905 --> 05:06.805
Yes, come in.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.074
Cardinal, forgive me.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.709
But this noble lady
has information

05:10.711 --> 05:11.910
Concerning a traitor,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.912
A man she saw who
bears the mark.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.715
Go on, dear lady,
unburden yourself.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.318
I'm afraid I can only share this
under the oath of confession.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.322
As you know, the mark is hidden
by clothing, so when I saw it,

05:23.324 --> 05:25.724
I'm afraid I was
sinning at the time.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.727
I will hear
your confession myself.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.696
May we have the room?

05:34.701 --> 05:36.702
(baby crying)
are you sure that
he's all right?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.537
The nannies say
it's common at this age.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.772
They just won't settle
for days on end.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.407
It goes away in time,

05:42.409 --> 05:44.643
All we can do is wait
for it to pass.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.645
Well, let the nannies
relieve you at least.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.080
Where are they?

05:49.682 --> 05:51.683
Perhaps it's foolish, but...

05:51.685 --> 05:52.884
Oh, I just don't
feel comfortable

05:52.886 --> 05:54.886
Leaving him with someone else.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.555
Not since the attack
on the castle.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.856
(baby continues to cry)
shh...

05:59.659 --> 06:02.894
Prince condÃ© has been accused
of bearing the brand.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.030
Who has accused him?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.631
I learned the news
during confession;

06:06.633 --> 06:08.033
My source must remain secret.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.135
My penitent is a married lady.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.771
So condÃ© slept with that woman.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.040
Convenient she's coming
forward now, isn't it?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.876
CondÃ© is a good patriot,
who's helped the crown.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.778
I struggle to see him
as dangerous.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.413
Perazzo: I understand
your reluctance,

06:21.415 --> 06:22.714
But the matter is
easily settled.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.783
My men will bring
prince condÃ© in,

06:24.785 --> 06:27.786
And we will see
if he has the brand or not.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.822
If he does, he'll hang.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.791
To the carriage
at once.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.127
Your grace, as the new
captain of the royal escort,

06:35.129 --> 06:38.063
I am charged with providing
your protection to chambord.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.731
Chambord can wait.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.669
Besides you, the only other
person who saw the brand

06:44.671 --> 06:46.071
Was a woman
named josephine.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.072
Whom you slept with?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.507
After you'd been branded?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.108
Yes.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.743
Uh, why are you
taking your spurs?

06:51.745 --> 06:52.744
My horse is...

06:52.746 --> 06:54.513
No, forget your horse.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.615
You'll be arrested before
you've gone half a mile.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.518
You'll travel in my carriage--
I will take you to chambord.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.186
Your home in condÃ© is the first
place they'll look for you.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.687
And if someone finds out
we're traveling together,

07:02.689 --> 07:04.689
Chambord will be
the next place they look.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.159
If only we could get you to your
brother, the king of navarre.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.094
But the roads along the
border will be crawling

07:09.096 --> 07:11.430
With swiss guards.
My brother's not
in navarre.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.864
There's an estate
one day's ride south from here.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.865
It belongs to a friend
of antoine's.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.568
If we can get
you there,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.069
You can travel to navarre
under his protection.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.704
(pounding on door)
man:
Prince condÃ©.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.107
By word of cardinal perazzo,
we demand you open up.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.742
Quick, to my carriage.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.910
It's in the alley,
out of sight.

07:36.856 --> 07:40.725
My god, I've missed the way
you mix garlic with arsenic.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.227
(giggles)

07:42.229 --> 07:45.230
Oh, you'll exhaust
yourself flattering me.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.132
Death made
me lovesick.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.134
It's cold there
in the dark.

07:49.136 --> 07:53.572
But you... You are
downright toasty.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.775
Yes.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.243
Don't be stingy.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.878
Claude's a healthy
young woman.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.880
It'll take a lot more
to bring her down.

08:01.882 --> 08:06.218
Slowly poisoning her protects
me from getting caught.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.622
Is that what this is
really about, hmm?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.691
Not getting caught?

08:15.194 --> 08:17.829
She's our child.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.600
So are the twins.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.835
And since I'll be with
them for eternity,

08:23.837 --> 08:27.839
I take their wish for
vengeance into account.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.842
Claude was only five
when she murdered the twins.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.677
She didn't know
right from wrong.

08:32.679 --> 08:37.148
God must take these things
into consideration.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.151
I don't doubt claude
will go to heaven.

08:40.153 --> 08:44.556
And believe me, she'll get more
mercy from god than the twins.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.758
You've felt
their power,

08:46.760 --> 08:49.160
Haven't you, catherine?

08:49.162 --> 08:51.062
Yes.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.766
See, when they decide to
take her, it won't be quick.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.905
You'll wish you'd
done it yourself,

08:59.907 --> 09:02.841
And sooner.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.246
Ah, kenna.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.315
With death
comes wisdom.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.317
What did I ever
see in her?

09:12.319 --> 09:13.752
Well, it was her ass.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.120
You mentioned
it many times.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.255
Are you talking to me?

09:18.758 --> 09:20.158
Why would
I talk to you?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.928
You just said something
about my ass.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.264
Not everything is
about your ass, kenna.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.933
Move it
out of the way.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.340
Oh, dear.

09:39.011 --> 09:41.246
Oh, no.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.784
This soup will make
you feel better.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.221
Bash:
<i>Poison?</i>

09:50.223 --> 09:52.824
You weren't there, that soup
just didn't smell right.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.192
Besides, why is
catherine bringing all

09:54.194 --> 09:55.794
Of claude's
meals herself?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.862
And she wiped the blood
away from claude's nose

09:57.864 --> 09:59.130
Before the girl
could even see it.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.999
People do get bloody noses.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.201
Yes, just like
that neapolitan count's men,

10:03.203 --> 10:04.736
Whom catherine also poisoned.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.972
Catherine has been
acting odd lately.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.975
But killing her own child?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.776
She lives for her children,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.745
No matter how she argues
with them.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.183
If you think claude's in danger,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.784
Do what I do.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.152
(scoffs)
challenge catherine to a duel?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.388
Gather evidence.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.057
Test your theory.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.931
Herald: Mary, queen of France
and scotland.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.034
Prince louis of condÃ©

10:36.036 --> 10:37.235
And lady castleroy.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.370
Brother,

10:38.372 --> 10:40.905
What a delightful
surprise.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.374
Now, queen mary, it is

10:42.376 --> 10:44.342
A pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.744
Louis speaks very

10:45.746 --> 10:46.878
Highly of you.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.813
King antoine, I apologize for us

10:48.815 --> 10:50.248
Dropping in on
you unannounced.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.851
Nonsense.
You were just announced.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.919
In fact, as you can see,
we're planning

10:54.921 --> 10:56.788
A gathering here tonight.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.123
You'll grant us the privilege
of being

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
Our guest of honor?
Uh, we wouldn't want

10:59.926 --> 11:01.026
To delay the queen, antoine.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.427
I was planning

11:02.429 --> 11:04.195
On continuing my journey.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.864
Well, not without a rest
for your horses, surely?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.666
And somewhere to sleep?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.267
Oh, come, how often do

11:09.269 --> 11:12.137
The queen of France and
the king of navarre get to meet?

11:12.139 --> 11:14.172
Grace us
with your friendship.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.675
Allow our two nations to share
more than just a border.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.876
Of course.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.110
I would be honored.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.378
Wonderful.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.013
We'll ready you
a chamber at once.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.715
Louis?

11:23.717 --> 11:26.017
Let's get you settled in,
shall we?

11:27.887 --> 11:28.887
You were supposed

11:28.889 --> 11:30.021
To be getting close to francis.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.690
My eyes and ears.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.758
Yet you're here,
absconding with his wife.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.393
How do you think
he'll respond to that?

11:35.395 --> 11:36.928
I didn't have a choice.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.229
What could possibly

11:38.231 --> 11:40.065
Have prevented you from...?

11:45.037 --> 11:47.005
They weren't able
to arrest condÃ©.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.740
He'd already got word and fled.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.308
I heard.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.843
I questioned one
of condÃ©'s servants.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.211
And finally got
him to understand

11:53.213 --> 11:54.846
We were friends
of his master.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.382
He said that condÃ© escaped
in mary's carriage.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.919
Mary got him away?

12:00.921 --> 12:01.853
So she just swooped in
and grabbed him

12:01.855 --> 12:03.421
Under the vatican's nose.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.391
I wonder where
she's taking him.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.927
She has the heart
of a warrior.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.230
Yes, despite everything
that's happened.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.800
You know.

12:15.802 --> 12:18.303
Kenna was troubled
and needed to talk.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.973
Is mary all right?
I've been worried.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.843
I don't know.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.780
It's my fault.

12:28.782 --> 12:32.183
Every choice I made
led to what happened.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.284
They were narcisse's choices.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.819
But now that he is

12:34.821 --> 12:35.954
Out of the picture,
it's still mary

12:35.956 --> 12:37.956
That's doing what must be done.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.357
It's time that I worked
with her.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.925
She's fighting
the cardinal's witch hunt.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.427
And I must, too.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.995
You can't go to war
against the vatican,

12:43.997 --> 12:45.163
Francis, you know that.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.998
There must be some way
to at least

12:47.000 --> 12:48.800
Loosen their grip.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.435
When mary returns,
I don't want her to see me

12:50.437 --> 12:51.970
Cowed and powerless,
pretending

12:51.972 --> 12:53.972
That I am blind
to injustice.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.807
I want her to see
the man and the king

12:55.809 --> 12:57.208
She thought she married.

12:57.210 --> 13:01.012
Cardinal perazzo
claims the brand

13:01.014 --> 13:03.348
Is the infallible sign
of a protestant traitor.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.784
But I wonder

13:05.786 --> 13:07.786
How he'd explain it

13:07.788 --> 13:09.988
If a loyal catholic
were branded.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.965
(crowd oohing and ahing)

13:28.941 --> 13:30.275
I sent a page
to your quarters.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.976
He said you weren't
receiving messages.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.379
I was preparing for the party.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.815
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.450
You shouldn't stay
just to be polite.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.420
My brother's parties
have a tendency

13:42.422 --> 13:44.222
To become somewhat scandalous.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.358
Well, now I'm intrigued.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.037
(indistinct whisper)
(laughs)

14:03.008 --> 14:04.576
This is awkward.

14:04.578 --> 14:07.045
Yes, it is.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.479
Antoine:
Thank you all for coming.
A toast to our

14:08.481 --> 14:10.181
Guest of honor.
Queen mary,

14:10.183 --> 14:12.517
You're radiant.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.019
Like venus rising
from the foam-flecked sea.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.089
(all toasting in agreement)

14:18.091 --> 14:20.024
And tonight...

14:20.026 --> 14:22.493
I will select one
nobleman and one lady.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.929
Now, they may be married,

14:24.931 --> 14:27.899
But not to each other.

14:27.901 --> 14:31.035
It is to your benefit to wear
your hearts on your sleeves

14:31.037 --> 14:32.904
Tonight because my game,
as always,

14:32.906 --> 14:34.172
Will be to pair those who share

14:34.174 --> 14:36.407
A secret desire for each other.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.110
For my first couple,

14:39.112 --> 14:43.214
I call upon lord lepine...

14:43.216 --> 14:45.116
And lady malbouef.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.619
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

14:53.959 --> 14:57.295
â™ª there was a time

14:57.297 --> 15:01.900
â™ª when the mountains
kept their place â™ª

15:01.902 --> 15:06.638
â™ª they stood in line...

15:06.640 --> 15:09.173
I'm beginning to see
why your brother's wife

15:09.175 --> 15:11.476
Prefers to remain in navarre.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.045
Greer:
Good heavens.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.281
What if the king chooses me
to be paired with someone?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.116
We should leave.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.019
Yes, uh, one of us
should leave.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.922
The married one.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.190
Good night, then.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.496
I think I may retire
to my chambers.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.565
My curiosity has
been satisfied.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.135
And I don't think this
is an appropriate party

15:37.137 --> 15:39.704
For me to attend
without my husband.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.049
Where are you
off to, brother?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.717
Why don't I have
a normal family?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.052
Well, because you're
a prince of the blood

15:54.054 --> 15:55.119
And the brother of a king.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.387
You're not charming me tonight.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.389
Well, then may I apologize?

15:58.391 --> 15:59.958
I was wrong earlier.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.327
Bringing mary here was
a brilliant idea.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.429
Navarre is like you
at french court,

16:04.431 --> 16:06.164
A-a small protestant presence,

16:06.166 --> 16:07.632
Surrounded
by powerful catholics.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.002
And Spain on one side of us,
France on the other.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.037
To survive,
we must know every step

16:13.039 --> 16:14.639
Our friendly neighbors
are taking.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.041
I already know
why you need me to spy.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.277
Forget francis.
He's a catholic hardliner.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.645
There's enough blood
spilled to make that clear.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.213
We'll never win him over.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.482
But mary, you say, is open.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.085
A sympathizer.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.988
Mary is the royal
you should be

16:29.990 --> 16:31.255
Getting close to.
Are you asking me

16:31.257 --> 16:33.091
To seduce the queen of France?

16:33.093 --> 16:35.026
She has influence
over her husband.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.661
No.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.229
Oh, come now.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.597
She saved you at her own risk.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.333
She clearly likes you.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.002
Now, take her to your bed.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.070
They all fall in love
with you after that.

16:46.072 --> 16:50.074
And once she falls,
the rest will follow.

16:50.076 --> 16:53.378
Mary has no romantic
feelings for me.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.346
You never changed
a woman's mind before?
It's not possible.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.648
This is not
even close to the right time.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.283
And why is that?

17:00.552 --> 17:02.220
Look.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.690
I'm just not interested in her.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.192
To be honest, she's a bit
prudish for my tastes.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.135
(knocking)

17:17.137 --> 17:18.369
(door opens)

17:18.371 --> 17:21.639
I heard you were ill,
so I put together

17:21.641 --> 17:23.374
Some of the finest
cheeses and croissants

17:23.376 --> 17:24.609
To help you feel better.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.644
Perhaps I might read
to you as well.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.246
Have you heard
of this fellow chaucer?

17:28.248 --> 17:30.348
(sighs)
(door closes)

17:38.457 --> 17:40.391
This is a barbarous country.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.260
I hope our next assignment's
in Italy.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.728
(laughs)

17:43.730 --> 17:46.330
If that's a hint,
put it out of your mind.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.265
We go where the pope sends us.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.434
Perhaps one day...

17:49.436 --> 17:51.436
When you've climbed so high
that no one will bring you down.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.438
No one climbs that high.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.573
Prince condÃ© is
the most prominent

17:55.575 --> 17:57.275
Protestant in France.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.310
If you can bring him
in, discredit him,

17:59.312 --> 18:01.145
The pope will show you favor.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.580
Who knows where that could lead?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.849
There's only one rung
above cardinal.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.552
Your dreams do reach high.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.421
I'll be sure I'm not seen.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.137
(gasps)

18:26.139 --> 18:28.272
(grunting)

18:34.847 --> 18:36.848
(screaming)

18:58.904 --> 19:01.906
For my next selection,
the lovely

19:01.908 --> 19:03.641
Lady atley...

19:03.643 --> 19:06.277
And the prince of condÃ©.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.180
Another of your games?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.615
Well, you told me you that
weren't interested in mary.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.451
Not that you'd given up living.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.453
Or is it that only one woman

19:15.455 --> 19:17.455
Could satisfy?

19:22.227 --> 19:24.529
I hope this isn't
unwelcome to you.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.331
You seem more surprised
than pleased.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.534
I was surprised
the king paired us.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.403
I didn't know he was aware
of my attraction to you.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.606
Oh. You're very polite,
but I...

19:42.314 --> 19:44.482
Greer:
That gathering downstairs
is awful.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.385
King antoine has a lot of nerve,
inviting a woman like you...

19:47.387 --> 19:48.819
It's not the party.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.888
It's not anything here

19:50.890 --> 19:53.491
Or at home.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.593
It's me.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.496
Everything feels
so distant.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.933
And I cling
to that distance, greer.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.235
I can't stand any man

20:04.237 --> 20:05.436
Trying to touch me.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.505
Even a courteous
touch of the hand.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.440
It's normal.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.709
After what happened.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.411
It will pass.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.379
Will it?

20:15.381 --> 20:18.516
How do we know what's normal?

20:18.518 --> 20:22.286
All I have to go on
is catherine.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.422
If there are
any other noblewomen

20:24.424 --> 20:26.624
Who have been...

20:26.626 --> 20:28.759
Well, they're keeping it
to themselves.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.729
As am I.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.465
All of us alone.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.768
What if this is what my life

20:37.770 --> 20:39.704
Is going to be like from now on?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.706
That's not true.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.275
You will recover fully.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.278
Because you're strong.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.413
I don't feel strong.

20:49.415 --> 20:53.251
I feel like I'm sleepwalking

20:53.253 --> 20:56.387
And I don't know how to wake up.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.557
If your heart wants to sleep,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.492
Let it.

21:01.494 --> 21:05.463
Many things can be
forced out of duty.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.898
But not
the heart.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.873
I can't do this.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.276
Well, your body tells
a different story.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.511
You're beautiful,
lady atley.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.580
But... Another
holds my heart.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.449
I can't get her
out of my mind.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.053
You love her,
but you can't have her, can you?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.889
Well, that's when a man
becomes truly obsessed.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.758
What a pity.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.295
A man like you
should not go unclaimed.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.601
What are you doing?

21:45.037 --> 21:46.604
Now I'm her.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.346
I've watched you
for so long.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.683
Never daring
to speak.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.420
I want everything
you want,

22:02.422 --> 22:07.058
Everything
you imagined.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.031
(knocking at door)

22:16.635 --> 22:19.537
Oh... You again.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.971
Well, you seem more talkative.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.540
You look better, too.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.008
No new meals
from your mother?

22:24.010 --> 22:27.578
Not since a clumsy visitor
knocked over the last two.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.480
Sorry about that.
I'm all thumbs.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.382
Try the brie.
It's delicious.

22:34.553 --> 22:35.886
Why am I
your patient?

22:35.888 --> 22:38.389
Are you a healer? No.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.658
Did I ask for your help? No.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.560
My mother's taking
perfectly good care of me.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.795
You are so foolish!

22:44.797 --> 22:46.397
Catherine is poisoning you,

22:46.399 --> 22:47.565
And I'm trying
to save your life!

22:47.567 --> 22:49.734
What?
How dare you suggest...

22:49.736 --> 22:51.802
Think about it.
Catherine's soup...

22:51.804 --> 22:53.604
When did you
first eat it?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.072
When did you first
start feeling ill?

22:55.074 --> 22:56.407
And how have you felt
since I took it away from you?

22:56.409 --> 22:58.509
You feel better,
don't you?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.978
Or, at least good enough
to act the horrid bitch

23:00.980 --> 23:03.047
And only after you've eaten the
safe food that I've brought you.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.416
Get out of here.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.618
Has catherine ever been
this solicitous of you before?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.887
Get out.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.489
I can't imagine
how it must feel.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.424
For your own mother
to want you dead.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.659
I'm so sorry,
claude, I truly am.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.661
What do you know?

23:17.663 --> 23:19.997
You're only a tart
my father lost his taste for

23:19.999 --> 23:21.599
And pawned off
on his bastard son!

23:21.601 --> 23:22.900
I'm so sorry.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.838
You think you're so clever!

23:27.840 --> 23:30.107
You think
you know me so well!

23:30.109 --> 23:31.675
Well, if you knew anything,

23:31.677 --> 23:33.577
You'd know that bash
and I were lovers.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.583
Perazzo:
What is the meaning of this?

23:39.585 --> 23:40.785
I was told my cleric
randall was arrested.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.787
A servant informed on him.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.188
He was seen placing

23:44.190 --> 23:45.856
A bandage over the
mark of his guilt.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.658
Francis:
He's one of them.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.093
A radical.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.095
I was branded against my will!
I was attacked!

23:51.097 --> 23:52.763
Who attacked you?

23:52.765 --> 23:53.998
I don't know.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.466
Uh... He wore a hooded cloak.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.668
You see?
All he has are fairy stories

23:57.670 --> 23:59.003
Of dark riders.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.638
You won't deceive the
cardinal with that.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.972
This is my cleric,

24:01.974 --> 24:03.774
A man I've known for years.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.843
His loyalty is indisputable!

24:05.845 --> 24:08.746
No one's loyalty
is that, I'm afraid.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.181
Take him to the dungeon,

24:10.183 --> 24:12.583
Let the torturers
do their work.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.051
Your-your majesty,

24:14.053 --> 24:15.920
This is
an ecclesiastical matter.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.688
I'll have the man
questioned myself.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.723
No, I insist.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.492
I want to show the pope

24:21.494 --> 24:22.793
That no nation
is more loyal to him

24:22.795 --> 24:24.862
Than France.
Randall:
Listen, please...

24:24.864 --> 24:26.197
Please!

24:26.199 --> 24:27.965
I wounded my attacker!

24:27.967 --> 24:30.134
Search the castle for someone
with a cut on his right arm!

24:32.103 --> 24:33.604
I know this must be a blow.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.739
Your trusted
cleric.

24:35.741 --> 24:38.209
But you yourself laid out the
logic of what the brand means,

24:38.211 --> 24:41.779
And we must accept the
truth, however hard.

24:41.781 --> 24:45.082
Unless you've changed your mind
about your theory.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.784
But you were adamant earlier.

24:50.755 --> 24:53.757
I will pray for randall's soul.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.228
Excuse me.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.701
Is he really going to let
us go through with this?
There's still time.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.903
Right now, he's in shock, but
let him live with the picture

25:05.905 --> 25:07.538
Of what will happen to randall.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.673
He'll back down.
And if he doesn't?

25:09.675 --> 25:12.009
I know that he and
randall are lovers;

25:12.011 --> 25:13.644
It's the worst kept secret
in France.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.712
But that doesn't guarantee
he actually cares.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.081
I believe he does care for him.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.550
I hope you're right.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.919
Otherwise, we'll have to execute
an innocent man.

25:28.226 --> 25:30.861
(knocking at door)

25:39.170 --> 25:42.072
I came to say good-bye.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.541
After tonight, I'm sure
you don't wish to linger.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.177
Thank you for helping me.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.246
I was glad to do it.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.549
Will you really go
back to french court

25:51.551 --> 25:53.817
When you leave
chambord?
Where else would I go?

25:53.819 --> 25:55.085
Have you considered scotland?

25:56.721 --> 25:58.722
You might be safer there
than France.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.990
There is unrest
in both countries.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.058
But here you have a husband

26:01.060 --> 26:02.826
Whose decisions endanger you.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.996
I'm sorry, but it's true.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.032
If it is true or not,
it is for me to deal with.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.867
There are things
you don't know

26:09.869 --> 26:12.169
About my marriage, things
I will not share with you.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.004
I admire your loyalty, but...

26:14.006 --> 26:16.073
You have no idea
what francis' intentions are,

26:16.075 --> 26:18.175
Or how he's suffering
because of what happened.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.650
But beyond that,

26:26.652 --> 26:28.152
I don't trust your motives

26:28.154 --> 26:29.853
In this advice.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.889
I read your letter.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.191
Oh, you never said...
Because I know

26:34.193 --> 26:35.926
That you tried
to get that letter back.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.294
One of the
servants you sent

26:37.296 --> 26:39.096
To retrieve it
told me so.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.364
You wished that letter
had never been sent,

26:40.366 --> 26:41.832
And I respected your wishes.

26:41.834 --> 26:42.833
I wrote that letter thinking

26:42.835 --> 26:44.068
I'd never see you again.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.135
That was not an attempt
at seduction.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.905
I know.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.173
None of us are responsible

26:49.175 --> 26:50.240
For our hearts,

26:50.242 --> 26:51.842
Only our actions.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.744
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.879
There isn't much to say,
is there?

26:55.881 --> 26:58.148
I suppose
honesty does that.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.851
Good-bye, then.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.121
If we meet again,
it'll be at a distance,

27:04.123 --> 27:05.389
At some court gathering
somewhere.

27:05.391 --> 27:08.025
Good-bye, prince condÃ©.

27:09.227 --> 27:10.828
May you have better fortune

27:10.830 --> 27:12.196
Than France has
offered you thus far.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.046
Where have you been?

27:29.048 --> 27:30.280
I've been waiting and waiting.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.982
What have I missed?

27:31.984 --> 27:35.019
Well, for one,
your sister claude

27:35.021 --> 27:36.320
Told me that you were lovers.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.188
Half sister,

27:38.190 --> 27:40.724
And it was years ago.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.326
We were very young, very drunk,

27:42.328 --> 27:45.195
And claude managed
to briefly convince me

27:45.197 --> 27:47.698
That henry wasn't her father.

27:47.700 --> 27:52.036
Well, now I understand your
insistence on the word "half."

27:52.038 --> 27:53.170
It was a mistake.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.139
A very brief mistake.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.174
And once I learned she was
lying, it never happened again.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.209
I was mortified.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.045
There is nothing
between claude and me,

28:01.047 --> 28:02.980
And what little there was--
it's long in the past.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.782
I feel like such a fool.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.050
I tried to be
her friend.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.384
When she was
cold to me,

28:07.386 --> 28:09.119
I thought it was because
of my past with henry.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.922
But no, it was your past.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.157
Your secret.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.958
What happened?
Are you all right?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.293
It's nothing.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.362
I was riding and I fell.
It's just a scrape.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.731
That's not a scrape.
That's a cut from a blade.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.965
You're lying to me.

28:21.967 --> 28:25.135
Yes, I am, kenna.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.737
Now, please stop questioning me,

28:26.739 --> 28:28.072
Because I can't answer.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.373
Claude is "nothing."

28:29.375 --> 28:30.808
Your wound is "nothing."

28:30.810 --> 28:32.076
If they were nothing,

28:32.078 --> 28:33.310
You would
talk to me.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.079
I've shared so many
things with you...

28:35.081 --> 28:36.447
How trapped I felt
with your father,

28:36.449 --> 28:37.981
How scared, how ashamed...

28:37.983 --> 28:39.283
You want honesty?

28:39.285 --> 28:40.751
Very well.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.920
I got this cut while
framing an innocent man

28:42.922 --> 28:44.254
Who's probably going to die.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.423
And I did this for what
they call "the greater good."

28:46.425 --> 28:49.827
I kill when it's expedient.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.361
I lie when it's expedient.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.267
That's who I am.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.012
I gave him
the last rites.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.251
Please.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.787
I can't explain
randall's brand,

29:16.789 --> 29:20.958
But I know he's a
good and loyal soul.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.761
Perhaps you could
speak to your brother.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.963
Ask him for mercy.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.265
You convinced my brother
the brand is a mark

29:28.267 --> 29:30.300
Of a secret league
of radical traitors.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.802
Perhaps you could convince him

29:31.804 --> 29:34.238
That you were wrong
about all of this.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.274
If you want to spare randall,
try.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.475
There must be
another way...
(grunts)

29:53.825 --> 29:56.527
Representatives from
the vatican have arrived!

29:56.529 --> 29:58.095
Call your master.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.396
Tell him
we've come

29:59.398 --> 30:01.298
For prince condÃ©.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.340
It seems antoine's been throwing
so much money around for these

30:10.342 --> 30:11.975
Parties of his that the
inquisitors heard he was here.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.243
He's stalling them downstairs.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.345
But if you don't appear soon,

30:15.347 --> 30:17.247
They'll force
their way up.
My brother doesn't have

30:17.249 --> 30:18.549
Enough soldiers here
to stop them.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.818
I'll surrender.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.252
They'll hang you.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.821
It's the only way to keep
everyone here safe.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.190
No. There's another way.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.458
Give me
your sword.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.996
The brand is what
brought them here.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.598
We'll have to get rid of it.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.266
Conde:
Burn if off?

30:36.268 --> 30:38.168
They won't be fooled.
They'll know what we did

30:38.170 --> 30:40.270
Or at least suspect it.
They will.
But all we need

30:40.272 --> 30:42.439
Is enough doubt to
prevent a hanging.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.208
With that, and with my support,

30:44.210 --> 30:46.443
We may convince them to arrest
you and take you back to court,

30:46.445 --> 30:48.412
Where francis can help.

30:49.981 --> 30:51.215
Ordinarily,
I wouldn't tell you this,

30:51.217 --> 30:52.850
Knowing your feelings.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.118
But as I may be dead shortly...

30:55.120 --> 30:57.354
You have a higher opinion
of the king than I do.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.323
He's hand-in-glove

30:59.325 --> 31:01.325
With the vatican.

31:01.327 --> 31:05.028
Louis, please believe me.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.264
Francis will help
when help is needed.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.501
Very well.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.438
I'll do it.

31:16.507 --> 31:17.908
You've done this before?

31:17.910 --> 31:19.376
No, but I saw
cauterizations done

31:19.378 --> 31:21.578
During my recovery,
after the war.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.146
Inquisitor:
His quarters are this way.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.615
Do it now.

31:24.617 --> 31:28.085
Inquisitor:
In the name
of the holy cross, open up!

31:28.087 --> 31:29.920
(condÃ© screams)

31:29.922 --> 31:31.321
Mary:
Hold on to me.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.223
(screams)

31:33.225 --> 31:35.425
I have you.
Inquisitor:
In the name

31:35.427 --> 31:37.361
Of the holy cross,
open the door!

31:38.596 --> 31:39.930
It's all right.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.231
You're all right.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.532
Open the door in the
name of the pope!

31:42.534 --> 31:44.268
Open the door!

31:44.270 --> 31:46.270
You removed the brand.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.306
That must have caused you a
great deal of unnecessary pain,

31:49.308 --> 31:51.475
Since you'll die regardless.
Lord condÃ©

31:51.477 --> 31:53.644
Had a wound that
needed cauterizing.

31:53.646 --> 31:56.613
The result of a drunken sparring
accident with my guard, leith.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.516
Isn't that right, leith?
It is.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.652
Inquisitor:
At the risk of offending,
your grace, I'm here

32:01.654 --> 32:04.655
To see that cardinal perazzo's
orders are carried out.

32:04.657 --> 32:07.190
Then we'll face cardinal
perazzo together.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.993
We'll all go back
to french court

32:09.995 --> 32:12.529
To ensure that proper justice
is served.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.501
Greer:
<i>Will condÃ© be all right?</i>

32:17.503 --> 32:20.103
I don't know.

32:20.105 --> 32:24.074
But I will keep
fighting for him.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.677
Because I am strong, greer.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.645
Burning off the brand,

32:28.647 --> 32:30.514
I had to touch someone else.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.215
To connect.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.417
And I was able

32:33.419 --> 32:35.519
To help.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.521
I don't want to go to chambord.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.090
You said you wanted time alone.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.092
No. Enough distance.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.427
I've been so deep

32:43.429 --> 32:44.728
In a well of my own pain,

32:44.730 --> 32:46.430
I couldn't see anything else.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.598
I forgot I'm not the
only one who's hurt.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.734
Francis is suffering as well.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.202
Are you rethinking
your decision then?

32:52.204 --> 32:53.236
To lead separate lives

32:53.238 --> 32:55.138
With separate rooms?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.406
I don't know.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.475
Oh, mary.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.445
What we had once had,

33:01.447 --> 33:04.181
It was so natural.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.984
I missed how easy it was.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.486
We'd make love and fall
asleep in each other's arms.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.122
Like branches
growing together.

33:12.124 --> 33:15.559
We didn't have to
think about anything.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.462
And now it's
so complicated.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.697
I don't know
if I'm ready.

33:23.568 --> 33:26.036
Are you ready to try?

33:29.207 --> 33:31.408
Perazzo:
My cleric was attacked!

33:31.410 --> 33:32.542
His arrest prearranged.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.311
Leave us.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.615
Your brother is behind it--

33:38.617 --> 33:40.217
Without your knowledge
hopefully.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.585
Because a king
that makes an enemy

33:41.587 --> 33:43.387
Of the vatican will be crushed.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.022
My brother is behind it.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.556
With my knowledge.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.259
And you will
not crush me.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.062
The vatican's brutality is
tearing my country apart.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.630
It must end.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.566
I'd hoped the son of henry
would be wiser.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.268
Look around you!

33:58.270 --> 34:00.570
Once we had a golden age,

34:00.572 --> 34:02.672
Where all looked to rome
for leadership.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.542
Now it's a bloodbath,
brother against brother.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.078
I'm trying to restore order.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.514
By spilling even more blood.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.115
We would've propped up
your rule!

34:12.117 --> 34:13.717
Our enemies are
your enemies.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.319
You fool, do you really believe

34:16.321 --> 34:18.155
Prince condÃ© is your friend?

34:18.157 --> 34:21.258
All you had to do was stand back
and let me collect him.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.727
That's what all this branding
really was, wasn't it?

34:23.729 --> 34:27.631
Your collection of enemies
to be marked and removed.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.833
And condÃ© was the biggest
fish in your net.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.601
It ends.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.136
You will take your men

34:33.138 --> 34:34.604
And your myth of the dark riders

34:34.606 --> 34:36.606
And you will leave France.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.275
Or your lover will die.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.211
You will release my cleric

34:41.213 --> 34:43.313
And beg for my forgiveness,

34:43.315 --> 34:45.649
Or the vatican
will destroy you!

34:45.651 --> 34:49.319
Why, it all depends on what we
really care about, doesn't it?

34:49.321 --> 34:52.489
You can crush me,
but randall will die.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.591
You can make France suffer,

34:54.593 --> 34:57.594
But randall will still die.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.696
And you love him.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.867
He's not worth the price.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.469
No?
(laughs)

35:05.471 --> 35:07.270
I understand love, cardinal.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.772
To see it, you need only
the smallest of clues.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.142
Before I chose randall
as our target,

35:12.144 --> 35:13.543
I had to be sure

35:13.545 --> 35:15.545
That you couldn't bear
to sacrifice him.

35:15.547 --> 35:19.616
So I had the servants
in your quarters questioned.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.585
Not about sex but

35:21.587 --> 35:23.253
About how you two live.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.222
And found no letters,
heard no declarations...

35:25.224 --> 35:26.590
It's cold here...

35:26.592 --> 35:28.425
In northern France, isn't it?

35:28.427 --> 35:30.327
A bitter winter.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.730
You brought a silver warming
tray with you for your bed--

35:33.732 --> 35:36.233
Monogrammed, the
servants tell me.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.767
But they were surprised
when they found it

35:37.769 --> 35:40.270
Not in your bed
but in randall's.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.606
And when they wake you
in the morning,

35:42.608 --> 35:45.509
They say you are
pale and shivering.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.277
Because you give
what little warmth you can

35:47.279 --> 35:49.713
To him... Don't you?

35:52.650 --> 35:56.353
That's love, cardinal.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.754
When you care more
about someone else's

35:57.756 --> 35:59.556
Suffering than your own.

36:02.593 --> 36:05.562
You'll have the victory.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.732
Release him, and we will
leave you to your fate.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.535
Thank you.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.436
Congratulations.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.572
You've used your knowledge

36:15.574 --> 36:17.741
Of the heart's noblest emotion

36:17.743 --> 36:19.776
To manipulate
and destroy someone.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.350
(baby crying)

36:28.920 --> 36:31.821
(knocking)

36:35.760 --> 36:37.694
I see I'm not the only one
that's had a long night.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.929
He's miserable.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.230
Nothing works.

36:40.232 --> 36:42.332
(sighs)

36:44.302 --> 36:46.803
(shushing)
(baby stops crying)

36:48.372 --> 36:51.775
(gasps, laughs)

36:51.777 --> 36:54.411
All he needed was
his father's arms.

36:54.413 --> 36:58.381
Or the poor thing
finally exhausted himself.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.849
Well, I like my story better.

37:10.828 --> 37:12.829
I want to put him down,

37:12.831 --> 37:14.798
But I don't want to wake him.

37:23.941 --> 37:25.508
Your eminence?

37:25.510 --> 37:26.943
(indistinct chatter)

37:26.945 --> 37:29.479
What's happening?

37:29.481 --> 37:30.680
CondÃ©.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.382
Welcome back to court.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.353
Bash, what's happening?
Ask francis.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.721
You'll be proud of him
when you hear what he did.

37:37.723 --> 37:38.955
You see?

37:38.957 --> 37:40.490
You were working in tandem,

37:40.492 --> 37:43.460
And you didn't even know it.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.832
Come.

37:51.669 --> 37:54.671
So... Did you enjoy yourself

37:54.673 --> 37:56.673
At king antoine's gathering?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.742
Which did you choose,
was it the sea bed

37:58.744 --> 38:01.044
Or the garden of
secret desires?

38:01.046 --> 38:02.712
You're jealous?

38:02.714 --> 38:03.980
Of course not.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.816
Then don't ask.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.818
I'll respect your choice

38:08.820 --> 38:11.054
To wait
for castleroy's return.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.723
But you must put your jealousy
aside out of respect for me.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.891
I said I wasn't...

38:14.893 --> 38:16.426
Because your jealousy--

38:16.428 --> 38:18.495
It only gives me hope.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.438
What are you doing?

38:28.440 --> 38:29.639
Where'd you hide it, mother?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.374
What are you talking about?

38:31.376 --> 38:33.777
Is this the poison
you've been using?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.945
This is what you've been

38:35.947 --> 38:37.847
Putting in my soup, isn't it?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.616
Give it to me.
I knew you hated me.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.851
But poison?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.887
Why?

38:43.889 --> 38:47.090
You murdered your sisters.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.826
What?

38:49.828 --> 38:52.095
Emone and henriette. Yes.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.464
You resented
their very existence.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.833
All the time that was
taken away from you,

38:56.835 --> 38:58.735
The loss
of my constant attention.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.936
Do you know that you used
to pinch them

38:59.938 --> 39:01.671
When you thought
no one was looking?

39:01.673 --> 39:03.006
You would hurt them.
I...

39:03.008 --> 39:04.641
I remember wanting
your attention.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.643
But I would never...
You would.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.346
And you did.

39:14.885 --> 39:17.053
You know, one day,

39:17.055 --> 39:19.756
The twins,
they ripped silk flowers

39:19.758 --> 39:21.057
Off of your favorite dress.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.059
You know what you did
in retaliation?

39:23.061 --> 39:26.429
You shoved those flowers
down their throats!

39:26.431 --> 39:29.733
I recall that dress.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.101
The flowers torn.

39:31.103 --> 39:34.804
But I wouldn't kill
my own sisters.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.439
You may not remember, but I do.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.108
Oh, seeing the look

39:38.110 --> 39:39.943
On your face when you heard
of their deaths.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.978
Oh, how shocked you seemed!

39:41.980 --> 39:44.147
Oh, the tears
that poured and the love

39:44.149 --> 39:45.815
That you espoused for them.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.484
Is it not possible
that I was weeping

39:47.486 --> 39:49.953
Because I had
lost my sisters?

39:49.955 --> 39:51.888
Because I was sad?

39:51.890 --> 39:54.424
Because I didn't do it?

39:54.426 --> 39:56.159
I wish that were true.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.827
I told you
that I protected you,

39:57.829 --> 39:59.596
That I cared for you,
and I did.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.698
And that is
why I lied for you.

40:01.700 --> 40:05.001
And so convincingly that you've
come to believe it to be true.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.437
I suppose there are

40:07.439 --> 40:09.506
Other monsters in the world.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.442
Their mothers have
to lie for them, too.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.445
Oh, there's
no other choice, I suppose.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.847
But now you try to kill me?

40:17.849 --> 40:20.850
After all these years?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.185
I tried everything else.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.088
I don't understand.
Tried what?

40:31.862 --> 40:34.564
There's a price to pay
for such things.

40:38.736 --> 40:41.805
Is this the price? My death?

40:41.807 --> 40:43.740
Say it, mother!
Do you want me to die?

40:43.742 --> 40:44.841
Claude, please...

40:44.843 --> 40:46.042
If I'm the murderer

40:46.044 --> 40:47.710
You think I am,
then I deserve

40:47.712 --> 40:48.945
To die.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.513
Don't!

40:50.515 --> 40:52.816
(crying)

40:52.818 --> 40:56.119
It's all right. You were
only five years old.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.487
You didn't know
what you were doing.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.989
You didn't know.

41:01.225 --> 41:04.961
Do not betray
your other children.

41:06.564 --> 41:09.632
Catherine:
She didn't know.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.870
â™ª just let me go

41:18.809 --> 41:22.512
â™ª just let me go

41:30.054 --> 41:32.121
It's all right.

41:38.028 --> 41:41.965
â™ª who will save my soul?
