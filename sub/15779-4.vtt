10:43.810 --> 10:45.926

10:46.771 --> 10:50.480
Please do not move while
the nozzle is engaging.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.225
Moving will disrupt calibration of...

10:53.361 --> 10:55.147

11:40.658 --> 11:43.070

12:37.882 --> 12:40.123
I was starting to teach your
more punctual peers.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.128
Sorry, Professor Fantomos.
I had trouble finding the building.

12:44.264 --> 12:48.098
Yes, yes.
It's a great big, new world for you.

And, Mr. Quizboy, I heard you
were recently exonerated...

12:51.062 --> 12:52.973
but allow me to impress one
thing upon you--

12:53.106 --> 12:56.474
we do not tolerate
cheating at State University.

Professor Fantomos,

Ah, well, if you'll excuse me, class.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.195

I've-- I've been here for a day.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.622

14:02.759 --> 14:04.591

stores all the data.

You're a walking wire, and right now...

and do your god-given duty.

for one student...

for all of them.

Professor Fantomos,
if this is about my paper, I'm really sorry.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.169
We'll get to that, but first I wanted
to see how you were holding up...

14:41.297 --> 14:44.085
and extend my deepest
condolences about Stevie.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.083
Oh, I'm the one who should be sorry.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.428
I understand he was your lab
assistant for some time?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.842
Yes, he was
quite a clever boy--

14:51.974 --> 14:58.687
regrettable, which brings us
to the other reason I asked you here.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.021
My paper.
You see--

15:00.149 --> 15:04.438
I'll be needing a new lab assistant,
and I'd like him to be you.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.813
Me? Oh-- oh-- oh,
I-l don't think I'm ready.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.362
Nonsense! I read your paper.
It was brilliant, perfect.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.282
Frankly, I think my class
may be beneath you.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.906
And this ingenious contraption
you've built--

15:17.041 --> 15:19.829
based on a Mike Sariamo design,
is it not?

15:19.961 --> 15:21.918
He was a student of mine, you know.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.498
Ah, the brightest mind I've ever
taught-- until now.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.001
There's something you should
know, William.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.346
Like you, I was born...
different.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.805
Yes, my family rejected me...

15:34.934 --> 15:38.802
the last son in a long line
of costumed adventurers.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.396
Clearly, I couldn't take
on the mantle of my forebears...

15:41.524 --> 15:46.769
with this body, so I instead
turned to science.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.192
What nature, in her caprice,
left unfinished...

15:50.324 --> 15:52.782
science had the power
to make whole again.

15:52.910 --> 15:57.996
And now that I've acquired this,
my work here is nearly complete.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.867
You see, I've recently become
the beneficiary...

16:02.003 --> 16:06.793
of a rather generous grant from the Guild...

16:06.924 --> 16:08.005
of collegiate investors.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.250
Oh, I-|-- what?
Oh.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.343
Well, OK, well, I'd love to help you,
professor...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.258
but I don't know if I can handle
the extra work.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.300
Nonsense!

16:15.433 --> 16:18.516
The university bylaws clearly
stipulate that the roommate...

16:18.644 --> 16:22.103
of a suicide is automatically
granted a 4.0 for the semester.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.596
You've got a free ride...

you all to myself.

Of course he is.
All the intel points to it, damn it.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.785

You saw what he said.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.959
He's not in the Guild of Calamitous Intent.

It's like a businessman's club
or something.

That's what they said about
the Bilderberg group, son...

16:55.806 --> 16:57.888
- No, it hasn't.
- Oh, it will, kiddo.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.678
It was decided at the last meeting.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.721
Billy, you got to do
the lab-assistant gig.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.845
- You're our only hope now.
- What do you mean, "now"?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.847
Well, look, I didn't
want to tell you this...

17:05.983 --> 17:08.065
but Stevie was our other
man on the inside.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.776
Code name-- Pussyface.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.234
Is that why he killed himself?

Open your eyes, kid.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.646
Your real one.

17:13.782 --> 17:17.902
Fantomos killed him because
he was getting too close-- we think.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.574

17:21.374 --> 17:22.739

Relax, he's not gonna kill you.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.209
How can you be so sure?

17:26.337 --> 17:27.577
Because he's crazy about you.

17:27.713 --> 17:28.874
He loved your paper.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.371
I never wrote my paper.

17:30.508 --> 17:35.548
I spent the night explaining the dead Stevie
in the closet to the campus police.

We called in a favor.
