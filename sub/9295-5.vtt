00:13.848 --> 00:16.248
(tires screeching)

00:20.332 --> 00:22.133
I need to know about my brother.

00:22.134 --> 00:25.536
He's alive.
Get out now.

00:25.537 --> 00:26.804
It can't be long

00:26.805 --> 00:28.806
before they realize it's you.

00:28.807 --> 00:30.141
I need you to get
back in the car.

00:30.142 --> 00:31.142
Ah!

00:31.143 --> 00:32.877
(both screaming)

00:32.878 --> 00:36.047
HASTINGS:
Your brother was involved
with the attack.

00:36.048 --> 00:38.349
He's the insider
we've been looking for.

00:38.350 --> 00:39.651
What's going on?

00:39.652 --> 00:41.452
The body triggered
a Hazmat alarm.

00:41.453 --> 00:42.720
It's highly
enriched uranium.

00:42.721 --> 00:43.888
You mean it's weapons-grade?

00:43.889 --> 00:45.490
How the hell did he come
into contact with that?

00:45.491 --> 00:47.191
I think I know the answer.

00:47.192 --> 00:49.727
Someone approached my brother
with weapons-grade uranium.

00:49.728 --> 00:51.863
Who?
Someone who had access

00:51.864 --> 00:53.498
to decommissioned
Soviet stockpile.

00:53.499 --> 00:55.233
You must find the Russians

00:55.234 --> 00:57.335
before they can get
the uranium to my brother.

00:57.336 --> 00:58.770
I want proof
that the rods exist,

00:58.771 --> 01:00.038
or you will not be paid.

01:00.039 --> 01:02.473
You want proof, huh?

01:02.474 --> 01:04.007
<i>Come with me.</i>

01:04.009 --> 01:05.343
My younger son,

01:05.343 --> 01:07.312
he was transporting the rods,

01:07.313 --> 01:08.646
and he was careless.

01:08.647 --> 01:10.682
There, you have your proof.

01:10.683 --> 01:12.650
You were undercover
for nearly two years

01:12.651 --> 01:14.552
with the Russian mob.

01:14.553 --> 01:16.054
<i>Your cover is still intact.</i>

01:16.055 --> 01:18.489
Are you asking me
to go back in?

01:18.490 --> 01:20.925
Agent Walker hasn't been
undercover for over six years.

01:20.926 --> 01:22.927
I think you're making
a mistake by putting her in.

01:22.928 --> 01:26.397
You must have other options.

01:26.398 --> 01:27.532
She's our only way in.

01:27.533 --> 01:28.700
Fine, then I want
to go with her.

01:28.701 --> 01:30.201
I assume your plan is

01:30.202 --> 01:31.636
trying to set up
a competing buy?

01:31.637 --> 01:32.837
I'll act as a buyer.

01:32.838 --> 01:35.239
I'm looking for Vladimir.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.708
Vlad disappeared.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.376
But you can find him.

01:38.377 --> 01:40.378
They know where I am 24/7.

01:40.379 --> 01:41.713
I'm still in prison.

01:41.714 --> 01:43.247
Parole bracelet?

01:43.248 --> 01:44.882
I can get this off.

01:44.883 --> 01:45.750
(buzzing)

01:45.751 --> 01:46.784
You can't cut bracelet.

01:46.785 --> 01:47.919
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.455
(screaming)

01:50.456 --> 01:51.723
What the hell have you done?!

01:51.724 --> 01:53.057
That's it,
this is over.

01:53.058 --> 01:55.593
Maybe for you, Jack, but
I'm just getting started.

02:19.918 --> 02:22.620
(speaking native language)

02:22.621 --> 02:24.455
I thought you were
dead or captured.

02:24.456 --> 02:25.790
Where have you been?

02:25.791 --> 02:27.892
It took me this long
to get clear.

02:27.893 --> 02:29.227
I'm with Bazhaev.

02:29.228 --> 02:30.795
To hell with Bazhaev!

02:30.796 --> 02:33.231
Everything we have worked for,
it's all over because of him.

02:33.232 --> 02:34.999
It's not over, General.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.334
Of course it is!

02:36.335 --> 02:37.735
Your brother
is still alive,

02:37.736 --> 02:40.338
and your plan to replace him
as head of state is finished.

02:40.339 --> 02:42.407
Now his security forces
are rounding up our people

02:42.408 --> 02:44.075
all over the city.

02:44.076 --> 02:47.311
General Amiri was just pulled
from his home five minutes ago,

02:47.312 --> 02:49.113
in front of his wife
and children.

02:49.114 --> 02:51.949
Look, the Americans
won't let him continue.

02:51.950 --> 02:53.584
They'll accuse him
of human rights violations

02:53.585 --> 02:55.486
and threaten to pull out
of the peace talks.

02:55.487 --> 02:57.255
Once we have the uranium,

02:57.256 --> 02:59.457
my brother will become
irrelevant anyway.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.359
You are being hunted
like an animal.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.994
How do you expect
to get the uranium?

03:02.995 --> 03:04.395
Bazhaev can deliver it to us,

03:04.396 --> 03:07.565
but first I need payment
wired to his account.

03:07.566 --> 03:10.802
(Oleg gasping
and groaning)

03:10.803 --> 03:11.836
It's all right.

03:11.837 --> 03:13.204
Mm. Thank you.

03:13.205 --> 03:15.605
(groaning)

03:32.324 --> 03:34.992
(door closes)

03:34.993 --> 03:37.462
Papa, there's a clinic
in Mt. Vernon.

03:37.463 --> 03:39.931
I found a doctor
who can treat him.

03:39.932 --> 03:41.265
We have been through this.

03:41.266 --> 03:42.600
No doctors.

03:42.601 --> 03:44.302
Yes, but this one
has a family.

03:44.303 --> 03:46.304
I know where they are,
I know their names.

03:46.305 --> 03:48.339
I'll make sure
he keeps his mouth shut.

03:48.340 --> 03:49.941
And you can guarantee
no one else in this clinic

03:49.942 --> 03:51.275
will find out?

03:51.276 --> 03:54.145
Another doctor, a nurse, no one?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.948
The authorities know
about the nuclear material

03:56.949 --> 03:58.349
or they will soon enough,

03:58.350 --> 03:59.717
and they'll be
looking everywhere.

03:59.718 --> 04:03.087
Putting Oleg in a clinic
would lead them right to us.

04:03.088 --> 04:06.691
He's going to die if
we don't get him help.

04:06.692 --> 04:09.894
Then he's going to die.

04:12.231 --> 04:14.966
But alone like this?

04:14.967 --> 04:18.202
In a cold room
behind the kitchen?

04:18.202 --> 04:21.505
He's my brother, Papa,

04:21.507 --> 04:24.608
and he's your son.

04:29.248 --> 04:30.815
All right.

04:30.816 --> 04:32.149
Take him to the country house.

04:32.150 --> 04:34.285
Ulana will look after him.

04:34.286 --> 04:38.022
Thank you, Papa.

04:39.324 --> 04:40.825
What is it?

04:40.826 --> 04:43.494
Farhad is asking for you.

04:52.070 --> 04:54.572
You have news for me?

04:54.573 --> 04:55.940
Yes.

04:55.941 --> 04:58.609
The money will be transferred
to your account shortly.

04:58.610 --> 05:01.345
When can I take
possession of the rods?

05:01.346 --> 05:04.181
As soon as we have the money.

05:04.182 --> 05:06.951
Five hours.

05:06.952 --> 05:08.653
Good.

05:08.654 --> 05:11.455
I'll help you pass the time.

05:11.456 --> 05:14.959
(speaking Russian)

05:19.665 --> 05:21.766
You have a preference?

05:21.767 --> 05:23.801
No.

05:23.802 --> 05:26.202
Then take both.

05:33.712 --> 05:36.112
(grunting)

05:37.883 --> 05:40.418
He's still bleeding out.

05:40.419 --> 05:43.687
This should cauterize the wound.

05:44.957 --> 05:46.757
(sizzling)

05:46.758 --> 05:49.158
Okay, it's working.

05:50.896 --> 05:52.597
Who are you calling?

05:52.598 --> 05:53.931
Hastings.
Why?

05:53.932 --> 05:55.232
Because I'm shutting
this operation down.

05:55.233 --> 05:56.634
You shouldn't be in the
field, and this proves it.

05:56.635 --> 05:57.902
This was the only play, Jack.

05:57.903 --> 05:59.136
You would've done
the same thing.

05:59.137 --> 06:00.671
The play was to get him
to cooperate.

06:00.672 --> 06:02.640
He <i>will</i> cooperate.
How do you figure?

06:02.641 --> 06:04.241
Look, I know these guys, Jack.

06:04.242 --> 06:05.743
The only thing that Ziya likes

06:05.744 --> 06:07.378
more than 13-year-old girls
is money.

06:07.379 --> 06:09.146
ÃƒÂ­  He'd have butchered himself
for a score like this.

06:09.147 --> 06:10.815
Yeah, well, Hastings still
needs to know the truth.

06:10.816 --> 06:11.949
The truth?

06:11.950 --> 06:14.350
That you're unstable!

06:19.324 --> 06:23.527
Look... I don't blame you

06:23.528 --> 06:25.296
after everything
you've been through,

06:25.297 --> 06:27.798
but you are not fit
for this mission.

06:27.799 --> 06:30.601
I went through
a rough patch, yeah,

06:30.602 --> 06:32.436
but I came out
on the other side.

06:32.437 --> 06:34.837
And I don't think you have.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.109
The bottom line is,
I'm still the best chance

06:38.110 --> 06:39.944
that anyone has of
intercepting that uranium,

06:39.945 --> 06:42.345
and I can do it now.

06:47.119 --> 06:49.853
So, what's it going to be, you
making that phone call or what?

06:59.297 --> 07:01.232
(groaning)
RENEE: He's waking up, Jack.

07:01.233 --> 07:03.634
Better make up your mind.

07:08.073 --> 07:09.740
Fine.

07:09.741 --> 07:12.143
You see what you can
get out of him.

07:12.144 --> 07:16.880
But don't forget, I'm listening.

07:29.394 --> 07:31.562
(screaming):
Renee!

07:31.563 --> 07:33.097
Shut up, Ziya.

07:33.098 --> 07:35.032
(screaming):
Renee!

07:35.033 --> 07:36.200
You'll get your painkillers
as soon as we get out of here.

07:36.201 --> 07:38.436
What did you do?!
I got the bracelet off,

07:38.437 --> 07:40.104
all right, I did you a favor.

07:40.105 --> 07:43.140
You crazy bitch!
You cut off thumb!

07:43.141 --> 07:44.675
Look, what's done is done.

07:44.676 --> 07:47.011
You can either stay here
and whine about it like a baby,

07:47.012 --> 07:49.513
or you can come with me
and be a rich man.

07:49.514 --> 07:53.250
Look, I'm willing to give you a
point on this deal off the top.

07:53.251 --> 07:56.120
It's a lot of money, Ziya.

07:56.121 --> 07:57.455
(whining):
How much?

07:57.456 --> 07:58.956
Two-and-a-half million.

07:58.957 --> 08:02.026
Maybe three when it's all done.

08:02.027 --> 08:04.895
Two million?

08:04.896 --> 08:06.464
You're serious?

08:06.465 --> 08:08.865
You tell me.

08:11.203 --> 08:13.237
I take this deal to Vladimir,

08:13.238 --> 08:15.239
and it's not real,
you know what happens?!

08:15.240 --> 08:17.640
Why would I be here
if this wasn't real?!

08:19.044 --> 08:20.444
Fine, forget it, Ziya.

08:20.445 --> 08:21.746
I'll find Vladimir my own way.

08:21.747 --> 08:24.147
No, wait!

08:24.883 --> 08:29.353
I don't know
where he is exactly,

08:29.354 --> 08:30.721
but where he might be.

08:30.722 --> 08:32.556
Tell me.

08:32.557 --> 08:34.792
No, I'll take you there myself.

08:34.793 --> 08:36.159
RENEE (over comm):
You have a car?

08:36.160 --> 08:37.595
ZIYA:
I have truck;
it's parked out back.

08:37.596 --> 08:39.029
All right, I'll drive.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.429
Come on!

08:42.167 --> 08:43.200
(phone ringing)
Yeah?

08:43.201 --> 08:44.401
CHLOE:
Jack, I just found out in my

08:44.402 --> 08:46.537
background check that Ziya
has a probation officer.

08:46.538 --> 08:48.606
How do you want
to handle this?
You don't need to.

08:48.607 --> 08:49.874
He has a tracking bracelet.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.108
Not anymore.

08:51.109 --> 08:52.476
I don't understand.

08:52.477 --> 08:54.178
Those things have
anti-tamper mechanisms.

08:54.179 --> 08:56.247
You can't cut them off him
without triggering an alarm.

08:56.248 --> 08:58.549
Yeah, well, trust me,
it's been taken care of.

08:58.550 --> 09:00.384
Jack, what happened in there?

09:00.385 --> 09:03.521
Renee got the result
she wanted.

09:03.522 --> 09:05.489
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.

09:05.490 --> 09:06.757
Dana's still working

09:06.758 --> 09:07.958
on your cover profile.

09:07.959 --> 09:09.560
Okay, they're moving.

09:09.561 --> 09:11.961
I'll call you when it's ready.

09:24.009 --> 09:26.610
Jack's still waiting
on the rest of that profile.

09:26.611 --> 09:27.945
I'm still working the timeline.

09:27.946 --> 09:29.713
Tell him I'm almost finished.

09:29.714 --> 09:32.114
(phone ringing)
Okay.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.655
Aren't you going to get that?

09:37.656 --> 09:40.991
Yeah, probably should.

09:40.992 --> 09:43.194
Hello?

09:43.195 --> 09:44.695
I'm in the middle of something.

09:44.696 --> 09:46.230
Hold on a second.

09:46.231 --> 09:48.465
Chloe, I will send that profile
to you as soon as I'm done.

09:48.466 --> 09:50.866
Okay.

09:53.805 --> 09:55.906
I told you not to call.

09:55.907 --> 09:58.442
Yeah, I know what you told me.

09:58.443 --> 10:00.578
But now that I'm here
in your apartment,

10:00.579 --> 10:02.012
I just can't help but miss you.

10:02.013 --> 10:04.081
My shift is over in the morning.

10:04.082 --> 10:06.016
I will see you then.

10:06.017 --> 10:08.185
Yeah, well, that's just not
going to work now, is it?

10:08.186 --> 10:09.820
I'm right in the middle
of something, Kevin.

10:09.821 --> 10:11.422
Turn on the news
if you don't believe me.

10:11.423 --> 10:12.756
Hey, that's not my problem.

10:12.757 --> 10:14.358
Okay, I need to see you.

10:14.359 --> 10:17.461
You have 15 minutes.
That's not possible.

10:17.462 --> 10:19.864
Okay, you got 30.

10:19.865 --> 10:21.465
Who said I can't be reasonable?

10:21.466 --> 10:23.934
Kevin...

10:23.935 --> 10:26.170
Don't make me call that
little boyfriend of yours.

10:26.171 --> 10:28.072
Rock his perfect little world.

10:28.073 --> 10:30.608
"Hey, pal, congratulations
on the engagement."

10:30.609 --> 10:34.044
By the way, her name's not
Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott.

10:34.045 --> 10:35.913
Oh, did I mention
that she's an ex-con?

10:35.914 --> 10:37.548
No, no, no,
nothing too serious.

10:37.549 --> 10:41.752
"Just accessory to murder
is all."

10:41.753 --> 10:43.554
You still there?

10:43.555 --> 10:45.589
Yeah, I'm here.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.990
See you soon.

10:52.063 --> 10:54.598
(clears throat)

10:54.599 --> 10:57.401
Arlo, can I ask you something?

10:57.402 --> 10:59.136
Yes, I'm available
Saturday night,

10:59.137 --> 11:01.405
and I can change my plans
for Friday if you want.

11:01.406 --> 11:03.374
Also, I'm free on Thursday.

11:03.375 --> 11:04.541
Look, Arlo, I'm sorry.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.377
It's just,
a situation's come up,

11:06.378 --> 11:08.045
and I have to go home
for a while.

11:08.046 --> 11:09.647
Dana, we're in the middle
of a major protocol.

11:09.648 --> 11:12.283
I understand that,
and I won't be long, I promise.

11:12.284 --> 11:14.285
But I need you
to cover for me.

11:14.286 --> 11:15.452
Put the finishing touches

11:15.453 --> 11:17.154
on the profile
for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.

11:17.155 --> 11:19.223
And if I ask what this is about,
you'll tell me...

11:19.224 --> 11:21.325
That it's none
of your business.
Right.

11:21.326 --> 11:22.693
I thought so.

11:22.694 --> 11:24.428
Send it to Chloe's screen
as soon as you're finished.

11:24.429 --> 11:25.462
Okay.

11:25.463 --> 11:27.298
Thank you, Arlo.
I owe you one.

11:27.299 --> 11:30.069
One what?

11:54.995 --> 11:57.895
I look forward to
seeing you tomorrow.

12:01.362 --> 12:03.196
They're concerned,
but they're all still

12:03.197 --> 12:05.598
planning to attend
the signing ceremony tomorrow.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.667
Well, I've got some bad news.

12:07.668 --> 12:09.002
Apparently, killing

12:09.003 --> 12:10.303
President Hassan
was only part

12:10.304 --> 12:11.471
of his brother's plan.

12:11.472 --> 12:12.839
CTU now believes

12:12.840 --> 12:15.541
he's also trying to acquire
weapons-grade uranium.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.644
From whom?

12:17.645 --> 12:19.579
A Russian crime syndicate
here in New York.

12:19.580 --> 12:20.813
Half of them are

12:20.814 --> 12:22.515
ex-Soviet Army or KGB.

12:22.516 --> 12:24.384
If anyone had access
to unsecured stockpiles...

12:24.385 --> 12:27.420
It's what we've been afraid of
since the Wall came down.

12:27.421 --> 12:29.555
Is President Hassan
aware of this?

12:29.556 --> 12:31.491
He's the one
who told CTU about it.

12:31.492 --> 12:32.792
Director Hastings
has already initiated

12:32.793 --> 12:35.028
an undercover operation
to try to recover the uranium

12:35.029 --> 12:36.763
before it's smuggled
out of the country.

12:36.764 --> 12:39.232
The nuclear materials
are here on U.S. soil?

12:39.233 --> 12:41.367
Are they sure?
Afraid so.

12:41.368 --> 12:44.537
Ethan, you asked
if President Hassan

12:44.538 --> 12:46.105
was aware
of this. Why?

12:46.106 --> 12:48.374
Helps explain what's been going
on in the Islamic Republic.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.209
I just spoke

12:50.210 --> 12:52.311
with our ambassador
in the I.R.K.

12:52.312 --> 12:54.714
Hassan's security forces are
sweeping through the capital,

12:54.715 --> 12:58.051
arresting opposition leaders,
shuttering news organizations.

12:58.052 --> 13:00.019
Has he declared martial law?

13:00.020 --> 13:01.387
Not officially, but effectively,

13:01.388 --> 13:03.056
that's exactly
what he's been doing.

13:03.057 --> 13:05.425
Who can blame him?

13:05.426 --> 13:07.527
I mean, his brother can't
have been acting alone.

13:07.528 --> 13:08.695
We want Hassan cracking down

13:08.696 --> 13:10.063
on hardliners in
his own government.

13:10.064 --> 13:11.631
Except that he's defying
his country's laws,

13:11.632 --> 13:14.600
as well as his international
human rights obligations.

13:14.601 --> 13:17.537
And if he continues, it may
delegitimize the peace accord.

13:17.538 --> 13:20.873
Is President Hassan
back yet from CTU?

13:20.874 --> 13:22.475
He'll be here in ten minutes.

13:22.476 --> 13:24.610
I want to speak to him... alone.

13:24.611 --> 13:27.480
I'll take care of it.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.257
That's enough.

13:38.258 --> 13:40.126
What's your problem?

13:40.127 --> 13:43.296
RENEE (over comm):
I need you thinking clearly.

13:43.297 --> 13:46.165
You tell me you'd get me
real painkiller.

13:46.166 --> 13:49.301
Put it away.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.409
I'm surprised.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.644
I'm surprised you take

13:58.645 --> 14:02.448
deal to him again
after what he did to you.

14:02.449 --> 14:04.784
How much further?

14:04.785 --> 14:06.252
Okay.

14:06.253 --> 14:08.354
You don't want to
talk about Vladimir.

14:08.355 --> 14:10.289
I understand.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.625
I don't blame you.

14:12.626 --> 14:17.029
After all, what is there
to say about such a man?

14:18.465 --> 14:20.767
Nothing good,
nothing very...

14:20.768 --> 14:22.101
Just tell me

14:22.102 --> 14:25.137
how much further.

14:26.373 --> 14:27.874
Ten minute.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.376
Touchy, touchy.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.280
(phone ringing)

14:34.281 --> 14:35.481
Yeah?

14:35.482 --> 14:37.316
Arlo just locked
your cover profile.

14:37.317 --> 14:39.018
I'm uplinking it to you now.

14:39.019 --> 14:41.487
Okay, hold on one sec.

14:44.324 --> 14:45.491
Okay, I got it.

14:45.492 --> 14:46.659
Hey, you're taking me out

14:46.660 --> 14:48.361
of Renee's comm
when you call, right?

14:48.362 --> 14:49.562
Yes.

14:49.563 --> 14:51.430
Okay, I want you to go
into her undercover file

14:51.431 --> 14:52.799
with regards
to Vladimir Laitanan.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.500
I need to know everything
that happened between them.

14:54.501 --> 14:55.835
I'll call you
right back.

14:55.836 --> 14:58.236
Okay, thanks.

15:05.212 --> 15:07.180
Mr. President.

15:07.181 --> 15:09.448
Your chief of staff said
it was urgent.

15:09.449 --> 15:11.317
It is, but first,

15:11.318 --> 15:15.188
I want to say again how thankful
we are that you're all right.

15:15.189 --> 15:17.657
If this is
about my security forces

15:17.658 --> 15:19.892
and the necessary steps

15:19.893 --> 15:23.062
I'm taking back home,
I'm afraid I can't help you.

15:25.332 --> 15:28.734
Are you so sure
they're necessary?

15:28.735 --> 15:31.537
What happened today
was nothing short of a coup.

15:31.538 --> 15:33.105
These same people are trying

15:33.106 --> 15:35.875
to restart my country's
nuclear weapons' program.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.510
I understand, but...

15:37.511 --> 15:38.811
No, I don't think you do.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.380
Yours is an open society,
Madam President,

15:41.381 --> 15:44.083
governed by the rule of law.

15:44.084 --> 15:46.085
Mine is closed.

15:46.086 --> 15:49.222
The only real law is power.

15:49.223 --> 15:50.823
Any perceived

15:50.824 --> 15:53.159
weakness on my part,
and I'm finished.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.594
I'm aware of the complexities

15:54.595 --> 15:57.163
of your situation,
Mr. President.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.600
My brother tried to kill me,

16:00.601 --> 16:04.103
helped by elements
within my own government.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.874
Those elements
must now be purged.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.876
Purged?

16:09.877 --> 16:11.611
You mean, executed?

16:11.612 --> 16:14.881
It is the only thing
my people understand.

16:14.882 --> 16:17.617
I can't vouch for you
as a reformer, Mr. President,

16:17.618 --> 16:20.186
if you renege on your
human rights obligations.

16:20.187 --> 16:24.123
The world is trusting you
because I trust you.

16:24.124 --> 16:26.525
You're asking me to show mercy
to enemies

16:26.526 --> 16:29.228
who are trying to destroy me.

16:29.229 --> 16:32.164
I am asking you
to find a middle way,

16:32.165 --> 16:34.166
in the name of bringing peace

16:34.167 --> 16:37.503
to a region that hasn't
known peace for generations.

16:43.143 --> 16:45.844
I need to see my family now.

17:02.429 --> 17:04.896
(groaning)

17:04.897 --> 17:06.265
I found a doctor.

17:06.266 --> 17:07.733
A doctor?

17:07.733 --> 17:10.936
Someone who can help you,
someone we can control,

17:10.938 --> 17:12.570
but Papa says
it's too risky.

17:12.571 --> 17:15.441
Papa's right.

17:15.442 --> 17:17.443
Condemning
you to death?

17:17.444 --> 17:19.878
I don't believe that.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.683
What happened...
was my own fault.

17:23.684 --> 17:26.285
The family shouldn't have
to pay for my mistake.

17:26.286 --> 17:29.488
You know, all these years,
I thought it was an act.

17:29.489 --> 17:32.858
But you really are the good son,
aren't you?

17:34.962 --> 17:37.163
I'm no better or worse
than you, Josef.

17:37.164 --> 17:38.831
You're my older brother.

17:38.832 --> 17:41.700
You've always
looked out for me.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.041
(tires squealing)
(horn honking)

17:49.042 --> 17:50.476
What are you doing?

17:50.477 --> 17:52.878
Joseph? Joseph,
what are you doing?!

17:52.879 --> 17:54.113
I'm taking you
to the doctor.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.715
But Papa said
we can't.

17:55.716 --> 17:57.283
I don't care what Papa said!

17:57.284 --> 18:01.128
I'm not letting you die
without a fight.

18:21.882 --> 18:25.584
You are old enough
to make your own decisions.

18:25.585 --> 18:26.786
I've decided to stay.

18:26.787 --> 18:28.654
As you wish.

18:28.655 --> 18:30.356
You should stay, too.

18:30.357 --> 18:31.624
I can't.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.392
Why not?
You think that

18:33.393 --> 18:35.961
your father is one way, but

18:35.962 --> 18:37.229
he's not what
you think.

18:37.230 --> 18:39.231
Stop doing that.

18:39.232 --> 18:40.733
You always
do that.
What?

18:40.734 --> 18:43.569
Imply things, but you never
actually tell me what you mean.

18:43.570 --> 18:46.939
It is better that way, Kayla,
believe me.

18:48.275 --> 18:51.210
I don't want to poison you
against your father.
(zipping bag)

18:51.211 --> 18:54.346
There.
You're doing it again.

18:54.347 --> 18:55.714
You can't help yourself.

18:55.715 --> 18:57.783
HASSAN:
Doing what again?

18:57.784 --> 18:59.118
Father!

18:59.119 --> 19:00.619
Oh, are you all right?

19:00.620 --> 19:01.821
I'm fine.

19:01.822 --> 19:03.155
We thought that...

19:03.156 --> 19:05.291
I know, I know.

19:05.292 --> 19:10.028
Kayla, I need to speak
to your mother now alone.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.931
Okay.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.244
Dalia?

19:25.245 --> 19:27.112
We have nothing
to say to each other.

19:27.113 --> 19:29.513
Dalia, please.

19:30.350 --> 19:32.451
Do you love her?

19:32.452 --> 19:34.220
It's over.

19:34.221 --> 19:35.821
I ended it.

19:35.822 --> 19:38.057
You didn't answer
the question.

19:38.058 --> 19:40.226
Be honest for once.

19:40.227 --> 19:41.727
Show me a little respect.

19:41.728 --> 19:44.496
I'm your wife, damn it.

19:44.497 --> 19:47.399
Do you love her?

19:49.836 --> 19:51.837
Maybe I thought I did.

19:51.838 --> 19:53.205
Then say it.

19:53.206 --> 19:55.875
What does it matter now?

19:55.876 --> 19:57.843
It matters to me.

19:57.844 --> 20:00.646
The truth is...

20:01.848 --> 20:05.885
...I'm just glad I could
still feel something, anything.

20:05.886 --> 20:08.854
And that's my fault somehow?
How dare you!

20:08.855 --> 20:10.489
Our fault.

20:10.490 --> 20:12.925
There's enough blame
to go around.

20:12.926 --> 20:14.393
Dalia, please don't go.

20:14.394 --> 20:16.328
What?

20:16.329 --> 20:18.063
I don't want you to leave.

20:18.064 --> 20:21.467
Don't worry.

20:21.468 --> 20:24.236
I won't make a scene.

20:24.237 --> 20:28.073
You should know me better
than that by now.

20:28.074 --> 20:30.442
My brother's
a traitor.

20:30.443 --> 20:33.078
My highest officers are
conspiring against me.

20:33.079 --> 20:35.281
And now President Taylor

20:35.282 --> 20:38.050
is threatening to pull
out of the peace talks.

20:38.051 --> 20:42.187
It has been a long time
since you've asked my advice

20:42.188 --> 20:45.291
about anything.

20:45.292 --> 20:48.928
You were the one who always
gave me the best counsel.

20:48.929 --> 20:52.798
Thank you for remembering that.

20:52.799 --> 20:55.300
Then you'll stay?

21:08.114 --> 21:10.949
It's too late for that, Omar.

21:12.585 --> 21:14.987
Too much has happened
between us.

21:14.988 --> 21:16.755
Dalia...

21:16.756 --> 21:19.458
I'm sorry.

21:44.718 --> 21:46.752
Vlad operates
t of here?

21:46.753 --> 21:48.220
Sometimes.

21:48.221 --> 21:49.955
He moved around a lot.

21:49.956 --> 21:52.358
ZIYA (over comm):
That's why cops
don't find him inside here.

21:52.359 --> 21:54.893
(sighs)
Come on, let's go.

21:54.894 --> 21:56.195
RENEE:
Hey, Ziya?

21:56.196 --> 21:57.429
Hmm?

21:57.430 --> 21:59.431
You know, Vladimir was
never fond of surprises,

21:59.432 --> 22:01.000
so I was thinking...

22:01.001 --> 22:03.635
maybe you could go in first?

22:03.636 --> 22:06.538
Get him used to the
idea of me again.

22:06.539 --> 22:08.507
Whet his appetite?

22:08.508 --> 22:10.509
Exactly.

22:10.510 --> 22:12.910
Okay.

22:20.053 --> 22:21.553
RENEE:
Is our cover in place?

22:21.554 --> 22:23.122
Yeah. Chloe got me everything.

22:23.123 --> 22:25.357
Good. Let's start going over
what happened in Mexico City.

22:25.358 --> 22:27.059
How we met, who we dealt with.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.460
First tell me about Vladimir.

22:28.461 --> 22:30.929
What do you want to know?

22:30.930 --> 22:32.798
What he did to you?
I heard what Ziya said.

22:32.799 --> 22:34.366
Ziya?

22:34.367 --> 22:36.402
Come on, Jack,
he's a drama queen.

22:36.403 --> 22:38.003
Damn it, Renee,
I am running this!

22:38.004 --> 22:39.238
Stop messing with me!

22:39.239 --> 22:40.572
I'm responsible for your safety.

22:40.573 --> 22:42.141
So, when I ask you
a straight queution,

22:42.142 --> 22:43.375
you give me a straight answer.

22:43.376 --> 22:45.044
Look, it was nothing, all right?

22:45.045 --> 22:47.713
I handled him six years ago,
I can handle him today.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.214
The only thing that
I am worried about

22:49.215 --> 22:50.616
is locking down this cover,
so, please,

22:50.617 --> 22:53.652
let's not waste another minute
on Vladimir.

22:53.653 --> 22:56.989
I'm a Munich-based arms dealer
named Ernst Meier.

22:56.990 --> 22:59.091
We met in Mexico City.

22:59.092 --> 23:02.494
You became my liaison
to the locals.

23:08.635 --> 23:11.503
Lugo.

23:11.504 --> 23:14.006
Long time.

23:14.007 --> 23:15.808
It's me, Ziya.

23:15.809 --> 23:17.810
I know who you are.

23:17.811 --> 23:19.578
Now what the hell
are you doing here?

23:19.579 --> 23:20.946
I've got business.

23:20.947 --> 23:22.815
Business?
Yeah.

23:22.816 --> 23:23.849
With Vladimir.

23:23.850 --> 23:26.351
You've got business with me?

23:26.352 --> 23:28.287
Vlad!

23:28.288 --> 23:30.789
I should kill you for even
thinking of coming here.

23:30.790 --> 23:31.824
What?

23:31.825 --> 23:33.092
(groans)

23:33.093 --> 23:35.828
Let me go, please!

23:35.829 --> 23:37.830
No, I...
Five years

23:37.831 --> 23:39.331
I've been living
underground.

23:39.332 --> 23:41.333
Five years! And now you walk
into my place of business?

23:41.334 --> 23:42.434
You're on probation!

23:42.435 --> 23:44.503
No. Not anymore, Vlad.

23:44.504 --> 23:46.505
Look.

23:46.506 --> 23:48.474
She get bracelet off.

23:48.475 --> 23:49.842
What are you talking about?
Who did?

23:49.843 --> 23:52.478
It's what I'm trying
to tell you. Renee.

23:52.479 --> 23:54.012
Renee Zadan.

23:54.013 --> 23:55.781
She come to my place

23:55.782 --> 23:57.015
looking for you.

23:57.016 --> 23:58.016
Yeah, she say

23:58.017 --> 23:59.017
she have buyer that

23:59.018 --> 24:00.119
you'd want to hear about.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.587
That it'd be good for all of us.

24:01.588 --> 24:02.855
It'd be worth it for all of us.

24:02.856 --> 24:04.857
Renee.

24:04.858 --> 24:07.459
<i>Dah.</i>

24:07.460 --> 24:09.628
She say where she'd been
these last five years?

24:09.629 --> 24:13.165
Uh, where everybody else was.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.166
In jail.

24:14.167 --> 24:15.801
Then she go to Mexico City.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.703
She say she got
the opportunity there.

24:17.704 --> 24:19.371
Mexico City, huh?

24:19.372 --> 24:22.374
<i>Dah.</i>
What do you think, Lugo?

24:22.375 --> 24:24.510
You believe this
piece of dirt?

24:24.511 --> 24:26.545
Sure I believe him.

24:26.546 --> 24:29.281
He's too stupid to make up
a story like that.

24:29.282 --> 24:30.649
It's her I don't believe.

24:30.650 --> 24:31.683
I never did.

24:31.684 --> 24:33.485
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.

24:33.486 --> 24:34.686
She's not the one
who sold us out.

24:34.687 --> 24:36.688
She shows up out of the blue,

24:36.689 --> 24:40.225
then 16 months later,
the feds are down our throats.

24:41.194 --> 24:42.661
I'm just saying, Vlad.

24:42.662 --> 24:45.062
You were just saying.

24:50.803 --> 24:52.804
Where's Renee now?

24:52.805 --> 24:55.205
Outside.

24:57.377 --> 24:58.677
Clean yourself up.

24:58.678 --> 25:01.078
Bring her to me.

25:17.919 --> 25:19.920
Arlo, where's Dana?

25:19.921 --> 25:21.955
She isn't at her desk.
She went home.

25:21.956 --> 25:23.390
Home?

25:23.391 --> 25:25.791
Yeah.

25:32.300 --> 25:35.168
(knocking)

25:35.169 --> 25:36.503
Who is it?

25:36.504 --> 25:37.904
It's me.

25:37.905 --> 25:40.305
You have my key.

25:41.275 --> 25:43.744
Nice of you to drop by.

25:43.745 --> 25:46.146
It's not funny.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.683
What the hell?! Who's he?

25:49.684 --> 25:51.017
That's Nick.

25:51.018 --> 25:52.986
It's a buddy of mine
from Beaumont.

25:52.987 --> 25:55.021
Get him the hell out of here.

25:55.022 --> 25:57.023
You know I can't do that, Jen.

25:57.024 --> 25:59.025
I already told him
he could stay.

25:59.026 --> 26:01.828
It'd be impolite.

26:07.969 --> 26:10.370
Here.

26:10.371 --> 26:13.039
What's this?

26:13.040 --> 26:14.274
It's $500.

26:14.275 --> 26:16.343
It's all I could get out
of the cash machine.

26:16.344 --> 26:18.845
I'll get you another
500 in the morning.

26:27.288 --> 26:30.290
You think you're smart,

26:30.291 --> 26:33.293
and the whole world's stupid.

26:33.294 --> 26:35.729
That's just not how it is, Jen.

26:35.730 --> 26:37.631
I don't think you're stupid.

26:37.632 --> 26:40.734
No? But you think you can buy me
off with $1,000?

26:40.735 --> 26:42.102
I'm not trying
to buy you off.

26:42.103 --> 26:44.037
(gasping):
No, no.

26:44.038 --> 26:46.173
WALSH:
What do you
want from me?

26:46.174 --> 26:48.341
You know what I want?

26:48.342 --> 26:50.210
What I really want

26:50.211 --> 26:52.279
is for you to stop treating me
like some dumbass,

26:52.280 --> 26:55.549
19-year-old stickup artist
with a fast car!

26:55.550 --> 26:59.486
You're not the only one
who's grown up.

26:59.487 --> 27:02.355
Easy, Kevin, easy.

27:02.356 --> 27:05.758
I've been waiting
for this moment.

27:06.928 --> 27:09.329
Dreaming about it.

27:10.665 --> 27:13.066
You owe me.
(blubbering)

27:14.402 --> 27:18.571
If you think that I testified
against you, I didn't.

27:19.707 --> 27:21.641
(grunts)
(groans)

27:21.642 --> 27:23.443
Don't lie to me!

27:23.444 --> 27:25.145
I'm not lying to you!

27:25.146 --> 27:26.379
I got out of jail

27:26.380 --> 27:27.380
before you did, yeah, but only

27:27.381 --> 27:28.381
because I went in as a minor.

27:28.382 --> 27:30.782
No other reason.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.322
The truth is,

27:35.323 --> 27:37.958
it doesn't change things,

27:37.959 --> 27:39.726
one way or another.

27:39.727 --> 27:41.461
See, I've done
my homework.

27:41.462 --> 27:43.863
I know what your job is.

27:45.299 --> 27:46.900
I'm a data analyst,
nothing more.

27:46.901 --> 27:49.336
Yeah, but you're a data analyst
for CTU.

27:49.337 --> 27:52.839
You got access to all sorts
of good stuff--

27:52.840 --> 27:56.176
bank codes,
port authority manifests,

27:56.177 --> 27:58.211
stock exchange.

27:58.212 --> 28:00.714
Access, yeah, but not
unrestricted access.

28:00.715 --> 28:02.382
You'll figure something out.

28:02.383 --> 28:03.984
You always do.

28:03.985 --> 28:05.852
But whatever it is,

28:05.853 --> 28:09.289
the payout's got to be at least
six figures, okay?

28:20.167 --> 28:23.569
Please, Kevin.

28:31.279 --> 28:33.580
Okay, here's the deal.

28:33.581 --> 28:37.417
You do this one thing for me,

28:37.418 --> 28:40.487
and I'm gone.

28:40.488 --> 28:43.890
I'll never bother you again.

28:45.526 --> 28:47.926
(crying):
I can't.

28:51.799 --> 28:54.200
(sobbing)

28:55.236 --> 28:58.238
You can.

28:58.239 --> 29:00.940
And you will.

29:04.312 --> 29:06.446
Since last August, we've
been living and operating

29:06.447 --> 29:09.182
out of a hotel called
Bella Noche on Avenida Juarez.

29:09.183 --> 29:10.317
Can't they check that?

29:10.318 --> 29:11.484
Yeah, it's been set up
as a safe haven

29:11.485 --> 29:13.153
for high-end criminal activity.

29:13.154 --> 29:14.988
They don't keep records.
Have you got the name?

29:14.989 --> 29:17.123
Bella Noche. I got it.

29:17.124 --> 29:19.826
Okay, I'm going to be monitoring
you, filling in the details.

29:19.827 --> 29:21.027
Just listen to my voice.

29:21.028 --> 29:22.662
I'll get you all
the information you need.

29:22.663 --> 29:25.298
He's coming.

29:36.577 --> 29:38.978
Come on. Let's go.

29:48.089 --> 29:50.090
(phone rings)

29:50.091 --> 29:51.358
Yeah?

29:51.359 --> 29:52.425
It's not pretty, Jack.

29:52.426 --> 29:53.860
She had a real problem
on her hands.

29:53.861 --> 29:55.295
Talk to me.

29:55.296 --> 29:56.529
According to the
responsible agent,

29:56.530 --> 29:58.198
Vladimir Laitanan was completely
obsessed with her.

29:58.199 --> 29:59.299
It turned violent.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.300
How violent?

30:00.301 --> 30:02.302
Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.

30:02.303 --> 30:04.304
A couple of trips
to the emergency room.

30:04.305 --> 30:05.605
Did he rape her?

30:05.606 --> 30:07.941
Not according
to these files,

30:07.942 --> 30:10.110
but it looks like he
tried a couple of times.

30:10.111 --> 30:12.946
Did she say anything about this
to you or Hastings?

30:12.947 --> 30:14.781
No.

30:14.782 --> 30:17.450
What's this about, Jack?

30:17.451 --> 30:19.452
Jack?

30:19.453 --> 30:22.455
The FBI tried to cover this up
as much as they could.

30:22.456 --> 30:24.124
But after she left the bureau,

30:24.125 --> 30:26.126
Renee went into a tailspin.

30:26.127 --> 30:28.995
She tried to kill herself at
least once that I know about.

30:28.996 --> 30:30.597
She says she's past it,
but I know she's not.

30:30.598 --> 30:32.132
I can see it in her eyes.

30:32.133 --> 30:34.167
You think she's purposely
putting herself in harm's way?

30:34.168 --> 30:36.836
I don't think she cares
what happens to her either way.

30:36.837 --> 30:38.838
Where is she now?
She's going in.

30:38.839 --> 30:41.074
I'm going to put you on speaker.

30:41.075 --> 30:43.476
(speaking native language)

30:48.449 --> 30:50.483
Hands up.

30:50.484 --> 30:52.885
Turn around.

31:02.196 --> 31:04.597
Go.

31:11.338 --> 31:13.773
Hello, Vlad.

31:15.409 --> 31:18.244
Renee.

31:18.245 --> 31:20.413
You changed your face.

31:20.414 --> 31:22.415
I had it done in Caracas.

31:22.416 --> 31:24.284
What do you think?

31:24.285 --> 31:26.086
Makes you look younger.

31:26.087 --> 31:27.887
RENEE:
I should get the name
of that doctor.

31:27.888 --> 31:29.923
He's not practicing anymore.

31:29.924 --> 31:31.958
A sad story.

31:31.959 --> 31:34.027
Our little friend here

31:34.028 --> 31:35.929
says you were
in Mexico City.

31:35.930 --> 31:37.464
For what?

31:37.465 --> 31:39.132
Had some business.

31:39.133 --> 31:41.101
Good for you. I have
some contacts there myself.

31:41.102 --> 31:43.036
Yeah, I know you do.

31:43.037 --> 31:45.205
So...

31:45.206 --> 31:47.607
give me names.

31:53.914 --> 31:55.381
The Peralta-Rodriguez...

31:55.382 --> 31:56.850
JACK (over comm): family.
Uh...

31:56.851 --> 31:58.885
The Peralta-Rodriguez family.

31:58.886 --> 32:00.286
Castorenas

32:00.287 --> 32:01.955
in Guadalajara.

32:01.956 --> 32:03.690
Ramon Jimenez.

32:03.691 --> 32:05.625
I know Ramon. Is his brother
Luiz still running

32:05.626 --> 32:07.627
their heroin operations?

32:07.628 --> 32:09.629
JACK (over comm):
He was killed nine months ago
by the Federales.

32:09.630 --> 32:13.366
Not since he was killed by
the Federales nine months ago.

32:13.367 --> 32:15.368
You know, Renee,

32:15.369 --> 32:18.371
now that you mention it,

32:18.372 --> 32:20.974
there is something different
about you, too.

32:20.975 --> 32:23.609
How do you mean?

32:25.246 --> 32:27.646
Your eyes.

32:28.716 --> 32:30.717
Your skin.

32:30.718 --> 32:32.285
You look like hell.

32:32.286 --> 32:36.088
Well, it's hard to look your
best with a gun in your face.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.329
No, that's not it.

32:43.330 --> 32:45.598
Something else.

32:45.599 --> 32:47.634
Have you been sick?

32:47.635 --> 32:50.336
No.

32:51.605 --> 32:55.074
Maybe you picked
up a little

32:55.075 --> 32:58.244
Hepatitis C
on your travels?

32:58.245 --> 33:00.680
Where were you staying
in Mexico City?

33:00.681 --> 33:02.649
The Bella.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.584
Bella Noche Hotel.

33:04.585 --> 33:06.219
Bella Noche, naturally.

33:06.220 --> 33:07.287
Then, of course,
you must know

33:07.288 --> 33:08.488
the government
official who allows it

33:08.489 --> 33:10.490
to operate without
police interference.

33:10.491 --> 33:11.724
Chloe, the hotel
in Mexico City--

33:11.725 --> 33:13.059
was there a local
politician on the take?

33:13.060 --> 33:14.294
I don't have it here.
Neither do I.

33:14.295 --> 33:17.597
Checking DEA database.
Come on.

33:18.966 --> 33:20.333
Chloe.
Give me a minute.

33:20.334 --> 33:22.769
She doesn't
have a minute.

33:22.770 --> 33:25.171
Waiting for a name!

33:25.172 --> 33:28.007
Go ahead, tell him.

33:29.076 --> 33:31.077
Really getting tired
of this, Vlad.

33:31.078 --> 33:33.246
His name!

33:33.247 --> 33:35.148
Got it-- Raul Castillo.

33:35.149 --> 33:37.550
Castillo,
Raul Castillo.

33:40.754 --> 33:44.023
Raul Castillo,
all right?

33:44.024 --> 33:46.792
Are we done playing
20 questions now?

33:52.333 --> 33:55.268
Yes, I believe
we are.

33:55.269 --> 33:57.971
(laughs)

33:57.972 --> 34:00.440
You know, Renee, I
had almost forgotten

34:00.441 --> 34:01.541
how much fun
you are.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.209
You're not like
other women.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.611
You have balls.

34:04.612 --> 34:08.781
Hmm, you always did say
the nicest things.

34:08.782 --> 34:11.684
Can we talk
about this deal now?

34:11.685 --> 34:14.320
I wish it were
that simple.

34:14.321 --> 34:16.356
Tie her up.

34:16.357 --> 34:18.024
What?

34:18.025 --> 34:20.260
Vlad, what are you doing?

34:20.261 --> 34:21.694
You gave me all the
right answers, Renee,

34:21.695 --> 34:22.962
but you're not
telling the truth.
You're making

34:22.963 --> 34:23.963
a mistake.

34:23.964 --> 34:25.465
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

34:25.466 --> 34:27.333
Him, too.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.534
Vlad, wait.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.370
Put them in the trunk.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.975
ZIYA:
Vladimir, Vladimir, no!

34:35.976 --> 34:37.310
No, Vladimir,
please don't do this!

34:37.311 --> 34:38.311
Listen to me!

34:38.312 --> 34:39.545
She come to me!

34:39.545 --> 34:40.612
She come to my place,

34:40.614 --> 34:41.614
the bitch!

34:41.614 --> 34:42.815
I swear!

34:42.815 --> 34:44.617
Vladimir, I don't know
anything about this!

34:44.618 --> 34:47.018
No!

34:49.156 --> 34:51.157
Chloe, what the hell
just happened?

34:51.158 --> 34:54.226
They put her in the trunk,
I lost audio.

34:54.228 --> 34:55.728
Boosting the signal now.

34:55.728 --> 34:56.728
Renee?

34:56.730 --> 34:57.730
Try it again.

34:57.731 --> 34:58.965
Renee, can you hear me?

34:58.966 --> 35:00.733
Say something.

35:00.734 --> 35:01.801
Chloe, I don't have her.

35:01.802 --> 35:02.869
CHLOE:
Then the car must be armored.

35:02.870 --> 35:05.270
Either that
or her comm shorted out.

35:07.908 --> 35:10.376
Are you seeing this?

35:11.011 --> 35:13.679
I am.

35:28.028 --> 35:29.429
Okay, I'm following north

35:29.430 --> 35:30.863
through an alley
towards Woodward.

35:30.864 --> 35:32.765
I think this operation
just blew up.

35:32.766 --> 35:34.701
Jack, are you planning
to intercept?

35:34.702 --> 35:35.702
Not if the car is armored.

35:35.703 --> 35:37.036
I'm gonna need tactical support.

35:37.037 --> 35:38.705
I'm alerting Hastings
to scramble a team now.

35:38.706 --> 35:40.573
Tell him I see four men
in the car,

35:40.574 --> 35:41.841
and we're going
to have to assume

35:41.842 --> 35:43.076
they're taking Renee somewhere
to kill her.

35:43.077 --> 35:44.077
Copy that.

35:44.078 --> 35:46.478
Damn it!

35:54.049 --> 35:55.767
MRS. LEVINE:
Don't work too late, hon.

35:55.768 --> 35:56.868
Call me when you're on the road.

35:56.869 --> 35:57.869
Will do.

35:57.870 --> 36:00.038
Dr. Levine.

36:00.039 --> 36:01.472
How did you get in here?

36:01.473 --> 36:03.808
My brother is sick.

36:03.809 --> 36:05.777
I'm not seeing patients
right now.

36:05.778 --> 36:06.811
He needs your help.

36:06.812 --> 36:09.614
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.
No.

36:09.615 --> 36:12.717
No one else can know
about this.

36:14.186 --> 36:16.988
My men are outside your house
in New Rochelle.

36:16.989 --> 36:18.356
I don't believe you.

36:18.357 --> 36:19.824
I just spoke to my wife.

36:19.825 --> 36:21.659
We're outside the gate.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.461
The address is
1614 Brook Street.

36:23.462 --> 36:25.396
The light in your
little daughter's room

36:25.397 --> 36:26.965
just went out
about ten minutes ago,

36:26.966 --> 36:29.167
so I want you
to put the phone down

36:29.168 --> 36:30.401
because you're not
going to try

36:30.402 --> 36:31.903
to warn anybody
about this.

36:31.904 --> 36:33.571
Do you understand?

36:33.572 --> 36:36.340
I understand.

36:40.045 --> 36:42.380
JOSEF:
My brother has
radiation poisoning.

36:42.381 --> 36:43.881
He needs
treatment.

36:43.882 --> 36:47.118
His symptoms seem
quite advanced.

36:47.119 --> 36:49.487
I'm not sure what it is
I can do for him.

36:49.488 --> 36:51.489
Well, you'd better be able
to do something,

36:51.490 --> 36:53.091
for your family's sake.

36:53.092 --> 36:57.295
I, um... I need to know
what kind of materials

36:57.296 --> 36:58.863
he came in contact with.

36:58.864 --> 37:00.231
It was uranium.

37:00.232 --> 37:02.033
Do you know what variant,
the isotope?

37:02.034 --> 37:04.602
Weapons-grade 235.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.614
Jack, this is Hastings.

37:16.615 --> 37:18.049
TAC teams are
three minutes away.

37:18.050 --> 37:20.218
All of them aware
that Renee is in the trunk?

37:20.219 --> 37:23.621
The instructions are
to engage only on my command.

37:23.622 --> 37:25.757
Any indication
where they're taking her?

37:25.758 --> 37:27.892
None.
Any percentage
in letting this play out?

37:27.893 --> 37:29.761
No. As soon as she's
out of the vehicle,

37:29.762 --> 37:31.396
she becomes that
much more vulnerable.

37:31.397 --> 37:33.464
If we engage now, it means
ending the operation.

37:33.465 --> 37:34.465
This operation's over.

37:34.466 --> 37:36.367
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

37:36.368 --> 37:38.903
Target just turned
south on Flushing.

37:38.904 --> 37:42.573
Jack, that's a feeder
onto the BQE in 2.6 miles.

37:42.574 --> 37:44.642
Mr. Hastings, if we don't engage
on these surface streets,

37:44.643 --> 37:46.277
we lose our tactical advantage.

37:46.278 --> 37:47.945
Chloe, get me an ETA.

37:47.946 --> 37:50.915
Intercept in...
two minutes, ten seconds.

37:50.916 --> 37:53.217
Sir, you need
to make the call now.

37:53.218 --> 37:55.887
All right, I'm
authorizing engagement.

37:55.888 --> 37:58.288
Stand by
for intercept protocols.

37:59.892 --> 38:02.293
This is good. Pull over.

38:16.708 --> 38:19.510
(cocking gun)

38:20.145 --> 38:22.545
VLADIMIR:
Open it.

38:23.282 --> 38:25.283
Vladimir.
Take them out
of the trunk.

38:25.284 --> 38:27.151
ZIYA (over comm):
Lugo, please, you tell him,
tell Vladimir...

38:27.152 --> 38:28.986
Chloe, I've got
a signal again.

38:28.987 --> 38:30.688
Please, Vladimir, Vlad...

38:30.689 --> 38:32.423
Something's wrong--
they definitely sound stopped,

38:32.424 --> 38:33.758
but the vehicle
I'm following

38:33.759 --> 38:35.326
is still going south
on Flushing.

38:35.327 --> 38:37.562
ZIYA:
She told me to come to you!
RENEE: Shut up, shut up, Ziya.

38:37.563 --> 38:38.863
It's not going to do any good.

38:38.864 --> 38:41.332
Confirming that, Jack,
the target is still moving.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.167
Chloe, we're following a decoy.

38:43.168 --> 38:45.236
They must have left
in another vehicle. Find it!

38:45.237 --> 38:47.572
Okay, pulling up
a satellite footage.

38:47.573 --> 38:48.639
All right, TAC teams,

38:48.640 --> 38:50.575
hold your positions,
stand by.
Jack,

38:50.576 --> 38:53.077
another car drove out of the
back of the auto parts building

38:53.078 --> 38:54.479
five minutes
after the first one.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.613
Are you kidding me?!

38:55.614 --> 38:56.681
I'm sorry, we were focusing

38:56.682 --> 38:58.082
everything on your follow.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.450
Just tell me where they are!

38:59.451 --> 39:01.851
Take them down to the water.

39:20.072 --> 39:21.305
Okay, I've got a GPS lock
on Renee.

39:21.306 --> 39:23.708
They're pulled off
at Newtown Creek,

39:23.709 --> 39:25.843
just south
of Bryne Memorial Bridge.

39:25.844 --> 39:27.345
Where are the TAC teams?
HASTIN:
I'm redirecting them now.

39:27.346 --> 39:28.679
How far out are they?

39:28.680 --> 39:30.515
At least ten minutes.
JACK: Tell them to move it.

39:30.516 --> 39:32.283
Put me back on to Renee's comm.
Damn it!

39:32.284 --> 39:34.552
(tires screeching,
horns honking)

39:34.553 --> 39:37.255
Renee, it's Jack.

39:37.256 --> 39:38.256
I know you can hear me.

39:38.257 --> 39:39.423
Vladimir had us
following a decoy.

39:39.424 --> 39:41.292
TAC teams are
ten minutes out.

39:41.293 --> 39:42.326
I'm on my way now.

39:42.327 --> 39:45.129
Do whatever you have to
to buy time.

39:46.965 --> 39:49.033
On your knees, both of you.
(gun cocks)

39:49.034 --> 39:51.569
Please listen to me,
I don't know anything.

39:51.570 --> 39:54.405
VLADIMIR:
Shut your mouth.

39:55.307 --> 39:57.241
I'm going to give you
one last chance

39:57.242 --> 40:00.711
to tell me what is going on.

40:00.712 --> 40:05.082
Vladimir,
I swear on my life,
she come to my place.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.918
I don't know
anything.

40:06.919 --> 40:08.753
(two gunshots)

40:08.754 --> 40:09.921
No!

40:09.922 --> 40:11.489
Renee.

40:11.490 --> 40:14.225
Renee?!

40:14.226 --> 40:16.260
Amazing.

40:16.261 --> 40:18.662
You didn't even blink.

40:29.241 --> 40:31.676
Go ahead.

40:31.677 --> 40:33.678
Just get it over with.

40:33.679 --> 40:36.447
Renee, what the
hell are you doing?

40:36.448 --> 40:37.682
Not yet.

40:37.683 --> 40:41.118
For God's sake,
don't make me grovel.

40:41.119 --> 40:43.120
Just pull
the damn trigger.

40:43.121 --> 40:45.256
First I want
to hear the truth.

40:45.257 --> 40:46.924
I want to know
who you really are.

40:46.925 --> 40:50.928
(scoffs)

40:50.929 --> 40:52.129
Who I really am?

40:52.130 --> 40:55.600
Yeah, who you are,
not a game, Renee...

40:55.601 --> 40:58.002
or whatever your name is.

40:58.637 --> 41:02.106
Fine, you want the truth?

41:02.107 --> 41:04.642
I'll tell you the truth.

41:06.345 --> 41:08.613
You were right.

41:08.614 --> 41:11.582
You were right, I am sick.

41:11.583 --> 41:14.051
I am so sick
of living like this.

41:15.988 --> 41:20.091
The truth is...

41:20.092 --> 41:22.727
even if you let me walk
right now...

41:22.728 --> 41:27.564
(over comm):
I have nowhere to go
and no one to go to.

41:33.105 --> 41:35.106
You don't want to do this deal,

41:35.107 --> 41:37.642
fine.

41:37.643 --> 41:39.710
Then you might as well
just kill me

41:39.711 --> 41:43.881
because this deal is
the only thing that I have.

41:43.882 --> 41:46.684
Renee, please don't
do this, please.

41:46.685 --> 41:48.419
Besides, you wouldn't
be doing anything

41:48.420 --> 41:51.155
that I haven't already
tried myself.

41:54.359 --> 41:56.360
Do it.

41:56.361 --> 41:58.761
Do it!

41:59.631 --> 42:02.199
RENEE (over comm):
Pull the trigger!

42:14.646 --> 42:16.647
I had to be sure.

42:16.648 --> 42:20.151
(panting)

42:20.152 --> 42:22.687
You understand,
right?

42:22.688 --> 42:25.523
Yes.

42:25.524 --> 42:29.393
Good... good.

42:31.196 --> 42:33.597
Dump him in the river.

42:46.511 --> 42:48.846
HASTINGS (over comm):
Jack, TAC teams are
almost there.

42:48.847 --> 42:51.415
I need a status update.

42:53.352 --> 42:54.785
CHLOE:
Jack, are you there?

42:54.786 --> 42:56.120
Do you copy?

42:56.121 --> 42:58.356
You tell the TAC teams
to stand down.

42:58.357 --> 43:00.024
What's going on?

43:00.025 --> 43:01.726
She's in.

43:01.727 --> 43:04.995
They bought her cover.

43:05.305 --> 43:11.885
