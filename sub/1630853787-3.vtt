You were an awesome leading lady.

10:50.691 --> 10:55.071
Basically, I, like,
raised myself on YouTube

10:55.154 --> 10:57.198
'cause my parents were always at work,

10:57.281 --> 10:58.699
and I taught myself to play piano.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.410
Taught myself to sing, too, I guess.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.288
And then I had
this music teacher at school,

11:04.372 --> 11:05.414
and she pushed me so hard

that I sort of forgot
what I liked about it to begin with.

and my mom put me on ADD meds.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.898
the whole Val ensemble casting thing
on something out of my control.

25:28.235 --> 25:32.447
It's okay, Ash. You were bummed.
You wanted an explanation.

25:33.907 --> 25:38.703
Last semester,
I didn't think I could be a leading lady.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.414
And tonight, I found out
I was born at brunch time.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.582
(ALL CHUCKLE)

25:42.666 --> 25:44.918
Guess there's always
something new to learn.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.173
Is that it, Ash?

25:51.341 --> 25:54.844
This, um, Corbin Bleu TV show thing,

25:54.928 --> 25:58.890
I thought it was gonna
be like my big break.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.602
-Hey, it still could be.
-Nah.

26:04.229 --> 26:08.817
But I think it could be yours, Anna.
(CHUCKLES) And you deserve it.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.660
Good night, cool kids. Leo Rising out.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.287
(GINA CHUCKLES)

26:20.787 --> 26:22.414
Don't let the Woman in the Woods get ya.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.791
-(GINA AND RICKY MOCK SCREAMING)
-(RICKY CHUCKLES)

26:27.210 --> 26:29.796
She's right, you know.
This could be your big break.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.424
-(LAUGHS)
-I'm serious. You're Anna.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.426
That's, like, a big deal.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.053
I'm proud of you.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.097
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my...

26:41.266 --> 26:44.144
There you are!
Stop leaving our tent without a hall pass.

26:44.227 --> 26:47.230
I woke up and you were gone,
and I thought you were dead.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.025
For the millionth time,
the Woman in the Woods is not real.

26:50.191 --> 26:53.320
-CARLOS: He's in a tough place tonight.
-So am I.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.489
Gee, I wonder why
I can barely sleep tonight

26:56.573 --> 26:59.159
when I've reached the pinnacle
of my theater career.

26:59.367 --> 27:02.120
Don't look at me.
The monster costume was Ricky's idea.

27:02.245 --> 27:06.291
Guys, I really don't mean to be rude,
but I have much bigger things happening.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.834
What's bigger than monsters?

27:09.461 --> 27:13.298
Well, there are two issues.
One, Dewey called with an update.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.425
-Corbin Bleu is coming extra early.
-Oh!

27:15.508 --> 27:17.594
It's a major code red.

27:17.677 --> 27:20.889
We're doing a first read-through
before I've had my third cup of coffee.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.182
What's the second issue?

27:22.682 --> 27:24.851
Oh, Ricky and Gina are 100% missing.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.353
What?

27:26.436 --> 27:28.355
What if the Woman in the Woods...

27:28.480 --> 27:31.024
-Kourt, I'm gonna stop you right there.
-But...

27:31.107 --> 27:35.403
Carlos is right.
I'm sure Ricky and Gina are fine.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.866
(GINA LAUGHS)

27:40.158 --> 27:41.743
(RICKY BLOWS LIPS)

27:41.826 --> 27:42.911
Hey, G?

27:43.328 --> 27:44.454
Tonight was a blast.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.373
Even though we couldn't find the shrine?

27:46.456 --> 27:49.209
Ah, it's the journey, not the destination.

27:49.626 --> 27:52.253
Thank you for your fortune cookie wisdom.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.631
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-Good night, Ricky.

27:56.424 --> 27:59.302
And we are still walking
in the same direction.

27:59.427 --> 28:03.056
-Not awkward at all.
-No. Awkward? Could not be us.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.100
-Mmm-mm.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

28:10.188 --> 28:12.190
