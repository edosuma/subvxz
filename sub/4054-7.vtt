00:02.794 --> 00:06.378
JIM: Three weeks ago, an invisible
dome crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.507
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.512 --> 00:14.128
forcing each of us to confront
our own personal demons:

00:14.806 --> 00:15.932
rage,

00:17.142 --> 00:18.723
grief,

00:19.144 --> 00:20.429
fear.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.684
My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.430
Now, in order to survive,

00:24.608 --> 00:27.566
we must battle
our most dangerous adversary,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.144
the enemy within.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.399
The sooner you become his mate,

00:32.574 --> 00:34.189
the sooner he'll be
what I need him to be,

00:34.368 --> 00:35.574
our protector.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.736
You and |, we're part of
something greater. You're one of us.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.663
I'm sorry, but I'll never be able
to be who you want.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.574
[GRUNTING]

00:44.127 --> 00:45.378
What happened?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.003
- What do I do?
- Get me to the caves.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.800
JULIA:
Did that starjust hit us?

00:54.221 --> 00:55.381
Oh, my God.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.716
JIM:
Looks like a meteor!

00:56.890 --> 00:58.972
NORRIE:
We have a way to fight the kinship.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.095
- How?
- Emotion.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.680
You all sure you wanna do this?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.390
Like you even need to ask, Red.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.055
Then the resistance starts here.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.567
Because of you, when she comes out
you're gonna answer for what you did.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.748
We're all that's left.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.374
At least we have food.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.086
Yeah, if that's what you call
this mystery meat.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.545
So this is my army?

01:34.928 --> 01:38.045
A cripple, two horny teenagers,
and a plucky newspaper girl?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.508
We're the best you've got.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.674
Yeah, world's over.

01:42.561 --> 01:46.145
Sam took out Christine,
the town's on its own.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.222
We need a plan.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.561
We find a way to use emotion.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.148
It's the only way to fight
what everyone's infected with.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.485
I'll take bullets over group hugs, okay?
We found guns, we ought to use them.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.240
- You do realize we're outnumbered?
- Yeah, they have weapons too.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.910
And why would you wanna shoot
everyone when they can be saved?

02:02.289 --> 02:04.871
Because I don't know if anyone
who came out of those cocoons

02:05.042 --> 02:06.748
is worth saving.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.829
And that includes you three.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.122
I'm going into town to see how
everyone's coping without Christine.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.631
All right, we're coming with you.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.382
You need someone
to watch your back.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.762
Hunter, keep working on cracking
the passcode to Christine's recorder.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.797
Whatever she said
could give us an advantage.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.307
JIM:
No, no. He stays, I'm staying.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.891
I'm not gonna let some pod person
stay here alone with our supplies.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.805
All right. Set these to channel three.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.474
We'll keep you updated
on what we find.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.396
You really think this little recon
mission's the best use of our time?

02:36.573 --> 02:39.736
If there's even a shred of hope for the
people we care about, we have to try.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.826
Don't stop.

[GRUNTING]

03:15.070 --> 03:16.981
Sam.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.531
How far you've fallen.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.441
You deserved it. I'd do it again.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.865
I can kill him.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.406
Just a quick snap,
and he's no longer a problem.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.538
No, l have other plans for him.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.742
Just kill me. I'll never help you.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.417
Don't worry,

03:34.756 --> 03:37.589
I can bring you around.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.258
He'll be out for a while.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.019
We'll need a private space to work
where we won't be disturbed.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.474
Our fallout shelter's perfect.

[DRONING]

03:57.946 --> 03:59.482
- What's wrong?
- I'm not fully healed.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.447
| used most of our energy supply
and oxytocin

04:02.617 --> 04:04.949
just to get back on my feet.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.115
I don't know if it was worth the cost.

04:07.289 --> 04:10.577
The kinship was lost
while you were gone.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.750
You made the right choice.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.711
They need you.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.923
Do you feel different?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.732
| feel like a weight's been lifted.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.747
Did you see that?

05:01.259 --> 05:04.877
- Dale, what's happening?
- l have no idea.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.616
Joe.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.274
Look at the sky. It's coming back.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.159
Julia, pull over.

05:36.044 --> 05:39.753
It's like a TV screen,
changing channels back and forth.

[PEOPLE WHISTLING]

06:16.751 --> 06:18.161
No way.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.918
How can she still be alive?

06:28.096 --> 06:31.384
She must have gone into a cocoon
after she was stabbed.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.220
When Barbie came out of one,
all of his wounds were healed.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.261
CHRISTINE: I know there's been a lot
of confusion over the past 24 hours,

06:37.439 --> 06:42.854
but the destruction that you witnessed
outside the dome wasn't real.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.149
It was an illusion.

06:44.613 --> 06:48.697
l projected it on the dome as a crucible
meant to bring us all together.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.529
To strengthen us
for the task to come.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.864
If we could just show them
how many times she's lied.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.158
No, logic's not gonna work.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.699
They're accepting everything she says
without question.

06:58.877 --> 07:02.244
There are amethysts in these tunnels
that need to be brought to the surface.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.954
We've got some mining to do.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.460
- Even Barbie's buying it.
- So is my mom.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.548
Gather any picks or shovels you can
find at town hall and meet back here.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.224
Christine has some sort
of a schematic in her office.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.555
I don't know what its for,

07:18.730 --> 07:20.846
but those amethysts
are definitely part of it.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.356
Well, Joe and I can go
find the schematic.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.858
Okay.
Go now while Christine's still here.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.236
Take my car.
Once you find it, get it to Bird Island.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.657
See if we can make sense of it.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.325
It might be the key to her whole plan.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.400
- Yeah.
JULIA: You know what?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.409
Give me your walkie.
Mine's running low on batteries.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.786
What are you gonna do?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.456
Keep an eye
on the mining operation,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.583
see what kind of information
I can gather here.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.164
All right.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.800
What happened?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.803
The situation is more complex
than I let on.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.015
Yesterday, Sam stabbed me.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.556
I only survived because James found
me and brought me to the tunnels.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.349
Well, you want me
to track Sam down?

08:06.528 --> 08:07.734
Oh, he's already in custody.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.065
I need you to spearhead
the mining operation.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.905
So why do we need
these amethysts?

08:15.370 --> 08:19.033
They power the dome, like batteries.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.991
The egg kept them charged,
but when it was destroyed,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.033
the amethysts began
to lose their energy.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.249
And I used most of
what energy was left to heal myself,

08:27.424 --> 08:31.212
and to create the illusion
that brought us together.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.842
If we bring the amethysts
aboveground,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.095
I'm hoping we can recharge them.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.380
And if we can't?

08:39.394 --> 08:41.100
The dome's surface will calcify.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.557
Everyone inside would suffocate.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.516
Okay. Well then,
we'd better get started.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.898
Eva, I need you
to set up a lunch station nearby,

08:51.072 --> 08:53.688
so everyone can be fed
without slowing down the work.

08:53.908 --> 08:54.897
Hold on.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.863
If you're gonna be on your own,
I want you to get a gun.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.528
We may have Sam,

08:59.706 --> 09:01.492
but who know what other threats
are out there?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.372
EVA:
That's not a bad idea.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.659
I'll grab one in town hall.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.749
The two of you seem closer than ever.
Have you slept together?

09:09.591 --> 09:10.671
Yes.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.544
I don't think he's completed
his transformation.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.093
Well, you're doing all the right things.
Don't worry, it's just a matter of time.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.815
Look outside.
Apocalypse has been canceled.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.688
Its not the first time
the dome lied to us.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.275
The skies are clear.
We might be able to get a signal.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.078
There's a message. Sent last night.
"Emergency Protocol.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.706
Confirm receipt and identity
with employee access code."

09:45.877 --> 09:47.458
Put in your access code.

You worked for Aktaion.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.802
Do I know you?

09:58.973 --> 10:01.965
Lily Walters. Your disappearing act
got me a promotion.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.474
What happened last night?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.681
The whole dome turned black
until a few minutes ago.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.561
Our satellites couldn't see inside.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.441
So no meteors landed?
The world is fine?

10:11.611 --> 10:12.646
Enough of your chitchat.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.153
Hey, I need to talk
to the man in charge.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.735
l monitor all communication
in and out of the dome,

10:17.909 --> 10:20.070
so you talk to me
until I say otherwise.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.661
You think I don ’t know who you are?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.997

in Dr. Marston's custody,

10:32.590 --> 10:35.377

and I can't reach him.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.138
I'm one of the few good ones left.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.514
The people here are infected by
whatever came out of that meteor egg.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.924
They killed your team.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.516
Marston's still alive.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.309
Those, uh, freaks captured him.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.520
Now, I've formed a resistance
and I can get him back,

10:53.695 --> 10:55.481
but we're gonna need
something from you first.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.069
Like what?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.489
A care package.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.115
Hold on.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.869
Didn't you kill Dr. Marston?

11:05.039 --> 11:08.076
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.
Satellites can't see indoors.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.379
Okay, I can’t make any promises,
but what do you need?

11:14.549 --> 11:16.835
Well, we managed to salvage
some firearms,

11:17.010 --> 11:18.170
but those won't be enough.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.177
So first, I need something
that's more explosive.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.928
So we're gonna split up
into two groups.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.094
This group here, you're gonna chisel
the amethysts out of the cave wall.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.637
Grab some tools.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.225
You guys, you're gonna help us build

11:32.400 --> 11:34.231
a winch-and-pulley system
over top of this hole

11:34.402 --> 11:36.267
so we can lift the amethysts out.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.812
Got it? Let's get to it. Come on.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.107

MAN 2: Let's get that support beam...

12:15.109 --> 12:16.974

to think about something.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.962
When you were in the cocoons,
why did it make me dead,

12:42.303 --> 12:44.885
and have you fall in love with Eva?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.714
Jealousy doesn't suit you, Julia.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.883
Please, just hear me out.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.803
That alternate reality needed
to pull you away from me.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.102
Have you thought about why?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.060
Well, I'm guessing
you have a theory.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.771
You're being manipulated
to be part of this kinship.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.436
The man I love
should see right through that.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.528
Don't turn away from us,
from what we have.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.994
What we had is in the past.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.247
It should still matter to you.

13:13.418 --> 13:17.331
Look, what I have now, with Eva,

13:18.923 --> 13:21.084
there's no more tension,

no more drama.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.073
You're not yourself, Junior.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.864
You were infected.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.822
But you and I can fight this,
we're family.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.328
My family is the problem.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.913
Crazy mother, narcissistic father,
drunk uncle.

14:39.087 --> 14:43.831
I'm part of the kinship now.
For the first time, I have a real family.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.379
OW. Aah!

14:55.144 --> 14:56.884
What are you doing to me?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.975
Thank you, James.
I can take it from here.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.023
Barbie could use another strong pair
of hands back at the crater.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.442
This is all for your own good, Sam.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.156
Good boy. Good boy.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.868
You're not like the rest
of those cocoon whackjobs, are you?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.579
- Was for a while, until--
- Till what?

15:20.753 --> 15:24.541
You fell off a roof
and decided to have feelings about it?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.545
Nothing like breaking your spine
to remind you

15:28.719 --> 15:30.710
of the most traumatic experience
of your life.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.383
Short version,

15:33.558 --> 15:37.346
my mom died in front of me,
slowly and in agony.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.099
My pain reminded me of that day.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.430
Also made me remember who I am.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.154
Be skeptical if you want,

15:47.321 --> 15:49.027
but I know she brought me back.

LILY [OVER COMPUTER]:
Hi, fellas.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.705
Took your time there, didn't you?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.079
My boss needed some convincing,

15:58.291 --> 16:00.202
but he agreed to your plan
to free Dr. Marston.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.625
Care package is on the way.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.420
Pleasure doing business with you,
buttercup.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.094
Hey, Julia. I'm on my way into town.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.504
You ﬁnd out anything useful?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.218
Yeah, the world's still out there.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.259
Yeah, I picked up on that.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.894
- Any idea what that was all about?
- Christine did it.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.146
As soon as the sky
turned back to blue,

16:24.317 --> 16:25.978
she came out of the tunnels
alive and well.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.689
Now she's got the town
mining those amethysts.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.569
Joe and Norrie
are trying to figure out why.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.900
Who cares why?

16:32.074 --> 16:33.200
Meet me at the high school.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.441
I know how to deal with this.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.114
Anything happens to my dog,

16:41.292 --> 16:43.328
I'm gonna break your arms
and throw you in the lake.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.090
There's not much gas left.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.377
If we charge the battery,
we can make it last longer.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.851
Watch out. Keep your eyes open.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.479
I think Christine, she may have sent
some people back here.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.639
Come on, we got this.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.775
We sneak in, we get the schematic,
and we get out.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.736
- Okay. Desk.
- Okay.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.441
All right.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.991
Joe. Come here.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.750
I think I found something.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.040
That's gotta be it.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.459
Looks like Stonehenge,
except squiggly.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.752
Let's get out of here.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.470
Julia, we've got the schematic.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.427
Copy that.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.432
NORRIE:
Look, there's my mom.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.689
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?

17:48.859 --> 17:50.315
Julia needs this.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.522
If we get my mom alone,
we can convert her.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.070
We want her on our side.

18:00.788 --> 18:01.868
What is that?

18:02.039 --> 18:04.121
Turns out
Aktaion's actually good for something.

18:04.292 --> 18:07.034
After the dome cleared, Hunter
reestablished contact with them,

18:07.336 --> 18:10.328
and then I negotiated,
and they sent this up through the lake.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.497
What do they want in exchange
for these explosives?

18:12.675 --> 18:16.964
They want us to, uh, free Dr. Marston
from his kinship kidnappers.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.845
And in case anyone asks,

18:20.308 --> 18:22.139
I did not slit that little weasel's throat.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.013
At least we have what we need

18:25.187 --> 18:27.678
to, uh, take care
of Christine's mining operation.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.767
You wanna use it all at once

18:29.942 --> 18:32.228
or you wanna save some
for a rainy day?

18:32.403 --> 18:34.485
Nothing good came out
of those tunnels.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.690
We'll use it all at once.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.491
We're not gonna let Christine rise
from the grave again.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.323
And if this plan works,

18:44.582 --> 18:46.368
some people are gonna die.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.833
This is war.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.509
Up,up,up.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.065
- So you and Eva?
- Come on, Junior. I'm a gentleman.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.022
- I have a sign on my back?
- No, I'm not trying to pry.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.904
I just think you guys
are meant for each other.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.774
And that's what it's all about, right?

19:22.453 --> 19:25.661
Yep, that's it.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.660
Eleanor, where have you two been?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.163
Remember my first day
of second grade?

19:33.214 --> 19:36.331
When I took a red marker to my face
and I pretended I had chicken pox?

19:38.803 --> 19:41.886
- Eleanor, you need to come with me--
- No, no, no, listen to me.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.468
Both of you knew I was lying,

19:44.642 --> 19:47.850
but you still took care of me
because you knew that I was scared,

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
and that I needed my moms.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.347
And now I need you again.

19:52.525 --> 19:56.734
I know you have emotions. I know it.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.902
Show me.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.281
You're wasting valuable time.
The kinship needs our help.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.864
Norrie, this is not working.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.653
Nope.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.907
Change of plans.

20:13.212 --> 20:17.080
It was your fault that Mom died.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.713
If you hadn't forced me
to go to that stupid reform school,

20:21.887 --> 20:24.799
then we wouldn't have even been here
in the first place.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.465
She was always the one that
I thought of as my real mom, anyway.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.847
She gave birth to me,
we had a stronger connection,

20:31.021 --> 20:35.640
and we didn't tell you,
but we both talked about it all the time.

That time I slept over
at Michelle Caldwell's house,

20:43.868 --> 20:46.655
we actually went to an all-night rave
in Long Beach.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.114
We hitchhiked.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.495

and put them to work.

You're transfusing me?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.327

It's a gift.

21:36.086 --> 21:40.170
And I'm giving you
what you need to return to us.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.752
I'll never be a part of the kinship.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.583
After you eat,
we'll finish up with these amethysts.

Not you two.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.337
Well, what about lunch?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.294
You can miss one meal.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.925
These amethysts are necessary
for our survival.

All right, let it down.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.140
- Got it.
- Steady.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.769
They've already got one of them
out of the tunnels.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.814
All right, everybody take a break,
go get you some lunch.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.732
Come back to this aften/vards.

for chow time.

you think you can plant the explosives
and get out in time?

does your old life, your human life,
