WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.437
Does everybody know
what time it is?

00:05.505 --> 00:06.971
<i>Tool Time!
Tool Time!</i>

00:07.040 --> 00:09.741
That's right! Binford
Tools is proud to present

00:09.809 --> 00:13.244
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:17.650 --> 00:19.450
Whoa, whoa!

00:23.022 --> 00:25.190
Welcome to our
<i>Tool Time</i> salute...

00:25.258 --> 00:27.192
to the last manly sport.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.263
- Rodeo.
- Rodeo.

00:31.331 --> 00:34.070
I mean, what's more manly than eating
your steak after you finish riding it?

00:34.100 --> 00:37.802
That's right. These cowboys
are a dying breed.

00:37.870 --> 00:41.539
Rugged individuals who pay no
mind to their overbearing mothers

00:41.607 --> 00:43.541
that won't let them
live their own life.

00:43.609 --> 00:45.277
Maybe it's out on
the range, maybe not,

00:45.345 --> 00:47.012
but let them live
their own lives!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.546
Al.

00:48.614 --> 00:50.081
Well, moseying right along...

00:50.149 --> 00:51.049
"Moseying along"?

00:51.117 --> 00:53.251
Yes. Auburn Hills,
Michigan is hosting

00:53.319 --> 00:55.553
the Longhorn World
Championship Rodeo this week.

00:55.621 --> 00:57.889
All right. We called the
little practice arena today.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.859
And we've got a championship roper
today to show you some little tricks.

01:00.927 --> 01:02.827
Heidi, bring him on out.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.403 --> 01:13.005
Where's the rest of you?

01:14.607 --> 01:16.479
They were gonna send us
a real cowboy, weren't they?

01:16.509 --> 01:18.276
I am a real cowboy, sir.

01:18.344 --> 01:21.713
My name is Ty Cisco. And I'm a
junior champion team roper.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.048
Well, it's nice
to meet you, champ.

01:24.116 --> 01:25.984
It's great to be here, sir.

01:26.052 --> 01:28.620
You know, when I was your age,
I could've been a cowboy.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.256
Golly gee!

01:31.323 --> 01:34.192
Riding the rodeo circuit.
That must be an exciting life.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.727
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

01:35.795 --> 01:39.063
But I also like school and messing
around with my hunting dog, Wiley.

01:39.131 --> 01:40.899
"My hunting dog, Wiley."

01:43.268 --> 01:45.937
Look, Billy Bob, you got me
in a bind here, you know?

01:46.005 --> 01:47.610
I promised the audience
some rodeo action.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.840
Can you do anything with that
little jump rope of yours?

01:49.876 --> 01:50.947
Yeah. I can show
you a trick or two.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.010
Okay, then.

01:52.078 --> 01:53.912
Yippi-ti-yi-yo! Klaus?

02:05.091 --> 02:07.259
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:07.327 --> 02:10.562
Let's have a big hand
for The Cisco Kid.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.199
I'll tell you,
that's not bad for a kid.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.435
You know, I'm pretty
good at roping myself.

02:16.502 --> 02:19.004
Folks, I apologize in advance.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.740
Klaus?

03:32.011 --> 03:34.679
This new French restaurant
opening up in Royal Oak.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.249
Maybe your father and I should
go there for our anniversary.

03:37.316 --> 03:38.788
How come you're not gonna
go to your favorite place?

03:38.818 --> 03:42.353
The one where that waiter
always insults him.

03:42.421 --> 03:46.158
Brad, it's our anniversary. I'm getting
a new waiter to insult your dad.

03:47.493 --> 03:48.493
Never stop giving.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.361
No.

03:50.429 --> 03:53.165
Plus, I hate that guy at Sorrentino's.
Antonio. He's really rude.

03:53.232 --> 03:57.936
And he sounds like Dracula.
"Good evening."

03:58.004 --> 04:00.037
Check this out. I guess
they got this new program

04:00.105 --> 04:01.673
where they put cameras
at intersections

04:01.741 --> 04:04.509
and try to catch drivers
who run red lights.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.812
Whoa, cool angles! They can get
the license plate from the back

04:07.880 --> 04:10.148
and the driver from the front.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.850
Let me see that.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.186
Gosh!

04:15.254 --> 04:17.654
Nobody's gonna be able to pick
their nose in the car anymore.

04:19.391 --> 04:20.625
I think this is outrageous.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.294
I mean, it's a blatant
invasion of privacy.

04:23.362 --> 04:25.497
It's another example
of Big Brother taking control

04:25.565 --> 04:27.766
and infiltrating
every aspect of our lives.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.305
You just don't
want to get a ticket.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.468
Fricking right!

04:32.238 --> 04:33.304
Hey, Brad! Good news.

04:33.372 --> 04:34.672
- Yeah?
- I got a lead on where

04:34.740 --> 04:35.507
we can take your
Mustang to repair it.

04:35.574 --> 04:36.941
Really?

04:37.009 --> 04:38.147
I'm surprised you have
time for mechanics

04:38.177 --> 04:40.144
considering what's coming
up a week from Friday.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.950
I know what a week
from Friday is.

04:45.017 --> 04:47.352
It's our anniversary!

04:47.419 --> 04:49.020
Our anniversary's
a week from Thursday.

04:51.256 --> 04:52.924
What's a week from Friday?

04:54.159 --> 04:55.326
Nothing.

04:57.529 --> 04:58.797
- She's good.
- She's good.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.872
Hey, buddy.
How's it hanging?

05:06.939 --> 05:09.707
I hope you're referring
to my work light.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.547
I am sorry.
I thought you were a guy.

05:15.614 --> 05:18.349
If I am, I have a lot
of unnecessary cramps.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.756
Yeah. I read about this
place in <i>Mustang Monthly,</i>

05:24.824 --> 05:27.391
and I'm looking for Alex,
the Saleen Mustang specialist.

05:27.459 --> 05:30.162
I'm Alex,
the Saleen Mustang specialist.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.869
So, you'd be working
on my kid's car?

05:37.937 --> 05:41.873
Look, how I fix cars has nothing to do with
the kind of underwear I wear, does it?

05:44.043 --> 05:46.310
No! Of course not!

05:46.379 --> 05:49.113
Wouldn't matter if you
didn't wear any underwear.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.817
It's a beautiful Shelby.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.387
Yup, '66 GT 350H.

05:55.454 --> 05:57.221
They only made 1,500 of these.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.523
Actually, a thousand.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.725
Nine hundred automatics
and 100 four-speeds.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.026
Quarter-mile time?

06:02.094 --> 06:04.396
15-point-two seconds
at 92 miles per hour.

06:04.463 --> 06:06.998
Pretty sweet deal considering the
original purchase price was...

06:07.065 --> 06:08.833
Thirty-five forty-seven.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.201
Are you done testing me?

06:10.269 --> 06:11.302
Almost.

06:13.205 --> 06:15.707
Who was the last actor
to join The Three Stooges?

06:15.775 --> 06:19.110
Curly-Joe DeRita,
but he's no Shemp.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.078
Hey! Tim Taylor.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.013
I know.
Nice to meet you.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.552
You want to take a look
at the Mustang then?

06:23.582 --> 06:25.387
Yeah. I was just about to
clock out, so let me wash up,

06:25.417 --> 06:26.789
- and I'll take a look at it for you.
- All right.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.187
But, hey, I gotta tell ya,
I'm a huge <i>Tool Time</i> fan.

06:29.254 --> 06:30.421
Really?

06:30.489 --> 06:31.961
Yeah, man. I just
really love the show.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.624
What's your favorite episode?

06:33.693 --> 06:38.496
Definitely the one where you
fell through that port-a-potty.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.399
Yeah, the ladies go nuts
over that one, you know?

06:41.467 --> 06:43.105
It's the first time I did
my own stunt, you know?

06:43.135 --> 06:44.336
Anything for the audience.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.905
Did that stink in there!

06:46.973 --> 06:48.406
How long have you
been a mechanic?

06:48.474 --> 06:51.877
Since I was two and I
souped up my own stroller.

06:54.546 --> 06:56.314
Okay. Ready.

06:57.383 --> 07:00.485
Wow! Wow!

07:00.552 --> 07:03.521
I mean, imagine that!
You know? Souping up your own stroller!

07:07.393 --> 07:08.393
Nice save.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.961
Let's go take a look at the car.

07:10.028 --> 07:12.129
Okay.

07:12.197 --> 07:14.670
Now, eventually, Brad and I are gonna
do some performance modifications,

07:14.700 --> 07:16.905
but right now I've got some
problems with the transmission.

07:16.935 --> 07:18.503
Like what?

07:18.571 --> 07:19.642
Well, there's this grinding
noise coming out of it,

07:19.672 --> 07:20.909
and I thought it
was the shift fork.

07:20.939 --> 07:23.040
Turns out that's not what it is.

07:23.108 --> 07:24.442
Maybe it's the syncros.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.110
Yeah.

07:26.178 --> 07:27.579
How do you know
so much about cars?

07:27.646 --> 07:28.884
You grow up with four brothers,

07:28.914 --> 07:30.482
you pick up all
kinds of guy stuff.

07:30.549 --> 07:32.187
- Four brothers? I have four brothers.
- No way!

07:32.217 --> 07:33.385
Yeah!

07:33.452 --> 07:35.487
Yeah, mine taught me
how to burp the alphabet.

07:35.554 --> 07:38.823
A woman of letters!

07:38.891 --> 07:42.360
Yeah, they taught me all about
cars and tools. It was great.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.562
One summer they even got
me a job as an arc welder.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.231
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! A woman arc welder?
Don't toy with me.

07:47.299 --> 07:48.504
Tim, you're veering
off the road.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.702
Sorry.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.442
Hey, why don't you downshift, so I can
hear that noise you're talking about?

07:53.472 --> 07:57.241
Okay. That should be...
There you go. Listen.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.610
Yeah, it's the syncros.

07:58.677 --> 08:01.112
I have the same problem
with my Fairlane Thunderbolt.

08:01.179 --> 08:03.114
A Fairlane Thunderbolt
with the big 427?

08:03.181 --> 08:04.381
Yeah. And the glass
hood scoop.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.588
I gotta take a look at this car.

08:05.618 --> 08:06.785
Tim, red light!

08:11.189 --> 08:12.661
That's a reflex
from having three kids.

08:12.691 --> 08:14.091
I'm not a kid.

08:14.159 --> 08:16.093
I'm well aware of that.

08:18.964 --> 08:20.364
Hey, Marty.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.799
Hey, Jill.

08:21.867 --> 08:25.770
Look. I want you to see what I got
Tim for our anniversary present.

08:27.105 --> 08:28.873
Wow! An old Hamilton.

08:28.941 --> 08:33.010
Yeah. You know, he's always talking
about the one that your dad wore.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.846
Yeah.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.614
Mom gave it to Jeff,
and he broke it.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.116
Then he gave it to me,
and I broke it.

08:41.086 --> 08:42.352
Then Tim wanted it,

08:42.421 --> 08:44.889
and Mom confiscated it
before he could come near it.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.191
Smart lady.

08:47.259 --> 08:49.193
All right, guys.
I'm late. I gotta go.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.366
I'm gonna go to Jason's and study.
Mom, can I take the Nomad?

08:51.396 --> 08:52.897
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Look, look.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.600
This is what I got Dad
for our anniversary present.

08:55.668 --> 08:59.136
You stole Grandma's watch?

08:59.204 --> 09:02.707
Yes, Brad, I did. I mugged her
outside the Social Security office.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.919
I've got some great news on the Mustang.
I'll tell you about it later on, all right?

09:10.949 --> 09:12.517
All right.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.452
So, honey, what do
you want for dinner?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.520
I'm not gonna eat. I'm just gonna change
clothes and go check on Brad's car.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.624
He's working on the car again?

09:19.692 --> 09:21.192
Yeah.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.695
He's been working with that
mechanic every night this week.

09:23.763 --> 09:24.996
Wow!

09:25.063 --> 09:27.499
He's usually so critical
of his car guys.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.534
Alex has gotta
be a hot mechanic.

09:31.169 --> 09:32.804
Yeah, yeah.
He loves this one.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.807
I wouldn't be surprised if he
spent the night at the garage.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.111
- Happy anniversary!
- Happy anniversary!

09:40.178 --> 09:43.782
They are so beautiful.
You guys...

09:43.849 --> 09:45.349
Wait, what do you want?

09:47.986 --> 09:51.722
Simply that you keep that in
mind the next time we screw up.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.024
- Okay.
- All right.

09:54.259 --> 09:56.160
Thank you.
You're so sweet.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.829
Hello? Hi, honey.

09:58.897 --> 10:00.898
Wait a minute, where are you?

10:00.966 --> 10:04.102
Well, how much longer?

10:04.169 --> 10:08.239
I can't believe you had to go to
the mechanic's on our anniversary.

10:08.307 --> 10:10.208
No, I don't want
to meet you there.

10:10.275 --> 10:13.211
Then we gotta have two cars. And
we gotta drive home alone...

10:15.047 --> 10:16.580
Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

10:16.648 --> 10:19.384
I'll call the restaurant, and
I'll move back the reservation.

10:19.451 --> 10:21.486
Yes. Shoot!
Yeah, okay. Bye.

10:21.553 --> 10:23.158
- Would you put this... Hang this up?
- Yeah.

10:23.188 --> 10:26.657
I got water all
over the mail. Man!

10:27.792 --> 10:29.560
What is this?

10:29.628 --> 10:31.893
This is from the Royal
Oak Police Department.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.695
It's a ticket.
Brad!

10:34.733 --> 10:36.401
Mom, I didn't get a ticket.

10:36.468 --> 10:38.602
And in case I did,
I got flower credit.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.841
Wait a minute. I think
this is your dad's ticket.

10:46.611 --> 10:47.811
Hello!

11:03.595 --> 11:05.430
Great restaurant.
Sorry I'm late.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.931
Happy anniversary.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.966
Is it?

11:09.035 --> 11:10.701
Look, I know you're upset.

11:10.769 --> 11:13.371
But I get so distracted when
I'm working under a hood.

11:15.574 --> 11:18.510
Come on! I lose track of time
when I'm working with my hands.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.482
Tim, who were you with tonight?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.218
Who I've been with all this
week. Alex, my mechanic.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.620
Then who is that?

11:30.255 --> 11:31.455
Alex, my mechanic.

11:33.358 --> 11:34.992
What is this?

11:35.060 --> 11:39.764
It's a ticket that you got while
joy-riding with your quote "mechanic."

11:39.832 --> 11:41.865
This is ridiculous.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.133
It was a slow yellow.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.670
The brakes are bad. How can
I get a ticket for this?

11:47.672 --> 11:49.673
Will you forget
about the ticket?

11:49.741 --> 11:52.409
Who is the woman? And why
is your hand on her breast?

11:52.477 --> 11:55.647
This is my mechanic, Alex. My hand is
not on her breast. It's guarding it.

11:55.714 --> 11:56.847
What?

12:00.152 --> 12:03.288
And may I say what a
fine job it's doing.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.192
Antonio?

12:07.259 --> 12:08.393
Good evening.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.796
What are you doing
at this restaurant?

12:11.863 --> 12:16.334
My previous employer grew weary
of defending me in the lawsuits.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.670
Can I get you
something to drink?

12:19.738 --> 12:21.106
Yes, you can.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.453
A very good bottle of champagne.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.074
We're celebrating
our anniversary.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.445
Champagne on an anniversary.

12:27.513 --> 12:28.946
How original!

12:31.350 --> 12:33.785
Okay, okay, okay.
Why didn't you tell me

12:33.852 --> 12:37.455
that you hired a beautiful, sexy
woman to work on Brad's car?

12:37.523 --> 12:39.995
Every time I try to tell you about
one of my mechanics, you cut me off,

12:40.025 --> 12:42.593
so I didn't bother with the details.
So what?

12:42.661 --> 12:45.363
When they're younger, bigger
details, I'd like to know.

12:47.132 --> 12:50.201
I didn't even know she was a woman
until she took off her clothes.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.440
She took her overalls off to
slip into something comfortable.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.711
Look, to me,
Alex is just a mechanic.

12:59.778 --> 13:00.916
There's nothing
going on between you?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.347
There's nothing
going on between us.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.049
Come on! You know I like
cars more than I like women.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.053
Just... I wanted this night to be special.
It's ruined.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.359
- It's not ruined.
- Yes, it is.

13:10.389 --> 13:11.589
We'll get another waiter.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.260
We got French food coming,
some champagne.

13:16.328 --> 13:19.230
Come on. I opened... I got you
something nice. Open that up.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.965
- You did?
- Yes!

13:23.736 --> 13:24.969
Oh, my God!

13:27.272 --> 13:30.742
We look like we're on our way
to rob a convenience store.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.154
We were on our way to the
Doobie Brothers that night.

13:39.184 --> 13:40.751
I know. That was
such a great night.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.687
Happy anniversary, honey.

13:42.754 --> 13:44.888
Happy anniversary.

13:44.956 --> 13:47.491
I got you something.
Here.

13:53.031 --> 13:55.966
Did you steal
this from my mother?

13:56.068 --> 13:58.803
No! I found one
just like your dad's.

13:58.870 --> 13:59.937
- No way!
- Yeah.

14:01.106 --> 14:02.340
Unbelievable.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.711
Hello? Hi, Alex.

14:06.778 --> 14:10.648
You found a Flowmaster at half price?
You are amazing.

14:10.716 --> 14:14.552
No, it's just funny. You know that
yellow light we slipped through?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.954
I got one of those ticket pictures.
You look great.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.956
I mean, the angle
on me's kind of bad.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.024
Huh?

14:20.892 --> 14:22.960
I can't hear. Hold on.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.496
You're fading out there.
What? Hold on.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.799
Got ya. Yeah.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.035
Uh-huh.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.338
Throttle body.
That's a great idea.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.606
Tomorrow. Okay?

14:34.673 --> 14:36.107
Right.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.175
Okay, bye.

14:40.713 --> 14:45.283
What a pity champagne costs the
same for one as it does for two.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.051
Happy anniversary.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.692
Why did you leave
the restaurant like that?

14:54.760 --> 14:58.296
I'm surprised you noticed. You were so
busy talking to your new friend, Alex.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.732
She found an auto part we were looking for.
She was excited.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.433
She didn't know it
was our anniversary.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.335
I'm sure she didn't.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.704
I'm sure it wasn't important
enough for you to mention.

15:13.278 --> 15:16.080
For your information, I didn't tell
anybody it was our anniversary

15:16.148 --> 15:19.383
regardless of race, creed
or sexual orientation.

15:19.451 --> 15:23.387
So, you're an equal
opportunity idiot.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.228
Well, that's a great way to celebrate
our anniversary, calling me an idiot.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.530
You earned it! You could've told
her that it was your anniversary!

15:28.560 --> 15:30.666
That you were with your wife, and
you could call her back tomorrow!

15:30.696 --> 15:33.669
That's exactly what I did say, right
after you bolted out of the restaurant.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.070
You should've seen
yourself talking to her.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.067
You were drooling
like a school boy.

15:37.135 --> 15:38.969
She got me a Flowmaster
at half price.

15:39.037 --> 15:40.571
Excuse me.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.911
While you were spending every
waking moment with this woman,

15:42.941 --> 15:46.010
I went to 12 different antique
stores trying to find a watch

15:46.077 --> 15:47.812
to honor the memory
of your father,

15:47.880 --> 15:50.481
and you didn't look at me
once like that tonight!

15:50.549 --> 15:53.150
Thanks a lot, Tim!
Happy anniversary!

15:57.322 --> 15:59.756
Wilson, what are you doing?
Planting snow peas?

16:01.759 --> 16:04.362
No, no, no, no, no, Tim. Did
you realize that in Thailand

16:04.429 --> 16:08.332
they sprinkle lemon grass on their
lawn to ward off a raging storm?

16:08.400 --> 16:11.369
What do they sprinkle on the
lawn to ward off a raging wife?

16:12.170 --> 16:13.504
Jewelry.

16:16.574 --> 16:19.877
Jill's having a problem
with my new mechanic, Alex.

16:19.944 --> 16:22.313
I thought you were
crazy about his work.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.914
Well, he's actually a she.

16:24.649 --> 16:26.150
Well, that's funny.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.619
You never told me
your mechanic was a woman.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.788
I didn't tell Jill either.

16:30.856 --> 16:33.590
When she found out that I
spend so much time with Alex,

16:33.659 --> 16:35.592
she got really upset.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.562
Why didn't you tell Jill
that Alex was a woman?

16:37.629 --> 16:38.796
It never occurred to me.

16:38.863 --> 16:39.863
Uh-huh.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.734
And why did you spend every
night with her this week?

16:43.802 --> 16:45.169
To work on Brad's car.

16:45.236 --> 16:46.236
Ah.

16:47.539 --> 16:50.007
And it took you that long to fix
the problem in the gearbox?

16:50.075 --> 16:52.876
No, that took about an hour and
a half, but we did other stuff.

16:52.944 --> 16:55.079
- <i>What other stuff?</i>
- You know, am I on trial here?

16:55.146 --> 16:58.082
Well, I'm very sorry, Tim. I'm just
asking if your mechanic was a man,

16:58.150 --> 17:00.351
would you have spent all that
time over at the garage?

17:00.418 --> 17:02.386
What does that have
to do with anything?

17:02.454 --> 17:06.156
Well, maybe you withheld information
from Jill because actually

17:06.224 --> 17:07.825
you are attracted to Alex.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.660
No, no, no.

17:10.494 --> 17:11.729
No.

17:11.797 --> 17:12.997
Maybe.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.935
Who hasn't fantasized
about dating an arc welder?

17:19.938 --> 17:21.872
I am attracted to her.

17:22.773 --> 17:24.374
It's horrible.

17:24.442 --> 17:25.276
No, it's not horrible as
long as you don't act on it.

17:25.343 --> 17:26.542
Yeah, it is.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.112
Well, I would never act on it.

17:28.179 --> 17:30.018
You want to be sure not to
put yourself in a situation

17:30.048 --> 17:32.049
where you could be tempted.

17:32.184 --> 17:35.620
You know, I'm the kind of guy that
doesn't like playing with fire

17:35.687 --> 17:37.388
unless it's on <i>Tool Time.</i>

17:38.857 --> 17:40.591
And we've all seen
what happens there.

17:42.861 --> 17:43.894
Alex!

17:43.962 --> 17:45.562
I'll be out in a minute, Tim.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.397
The car looks great.

17:47.465 --> 17:48.733
Hey, what's going on?

17:51.136 --> 17:54.038
Nothing. I just... I think I'm
gonna stop working on the car.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.306
But we haven't
finished the rear end.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.677
I think we've looked
at enough rear ends.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.451
Well, you're still gonna come by and
show me your hot rod, aren't you?

18:03.481 --> 18:05.550
I don't think so.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.488
I don't understand. I mean,
did I do something wrong?

18:07.518 --> 18:10.087
No. No. Not at all.
You've done everything right.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.875
And you were the right
mechanic for the job.

18:11.923 --> 18:14.859
But sometimes two rights
would make a wrong.

18:17.195 --> 18:19.063
You're a very
good mechanic, Alex.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.133
And you're also very attractive.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.669
And I am a very married guy. And I don't want
to, you know, violate that trust anymore.

18:25.737 --> 18:26.971
Tim...
Let me finish.

18:27.038 --> 18:29.073
And I know there's probably
some attraction to me

18:29.141 --> 18:32.009
because I'm a local celebrity
and a TV star, you know, and...

18:32.077 --> 18:33.277
- Hey!
- Hey, Greg.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.664
Oftentimes,
women your age find...

18:34.712 --> 18:36.580
Tim, I'd like you to meet
my boyfriend, Greg.

18:36.648 --> 18:37.714
Hi.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.050
Were you guys in
the middle of something?

18:40.118 --> 18:43.887
No, I am...
I am so finished.

18:43.955 --> 18:46.027
Listen, Greg, I'll meet you in the car.
I'll be there in a minute.

18:46.057 --> 18:48.459
Okay, nice meeting you, sir.

18:48.526 --> 18:49.793
You too, son.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.263
I'm an idiot!

18:53.331 --> 18:54.336
- You're not an idiot.
- Yes. I'm an idiot.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.399
No.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.633
You're just a man.

18:58.002 --> 18:59.236
A really attractive man.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.371
Nah.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.342
You know, you kind of
remind me of my father.

19:15.753 --> 19:18.089
Honey, I want to talk.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.257
You want me to say
that what you did

19:20.325 --> 19:21.997
last night was okay,
and I'm not gonna do that.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.728
Well, it wasn't okay,
but for a lot of reasons.

19:26.264 --> 19:28.299
Such as?

19:28.367 --> 19:30.538
Well, I thought I was going down
there to work on Brad's car.

19:30.568 --> 19:33.337
But it turns out that,
you know, she was young,

19:33.405 --> 19:35.006
and she knew about
The Three Stooges,

19:35.073 --> 19:38.409
and she knew cars,
and she's attractive,

19:38.477 --> 19:40.677
and I was attracted to her.

19:40.745 --> 19:42.746
So, was she attracted to you?

19:42.814 --> 19:44.315
Well, it turns out, no.

19:46.284 --> 19:47.844
I went down there
to pick up Brad's car.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.524
And I was telling her
that I was happily married.

19:49.554 --> 19:52.294
And trying to explain how it would be
easy to be attracted to a guy like me.

19:52.324 --> 19:55.026
And she introduces me to her
big stud muffin boyfriend.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.333
So, that must've been
kind of embarrassing.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.498
Yes, I made quite
an idiot out of myself.

20:02.634 --> 20:04.701
Go on.

20:04.769 --> 20:06.870
Well, junior there
called me "sir."

20:08.140 --> 20:09.773
That's good.

20:09.841 --> 20:12.376
She said I reminded
her a lot of her dad.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.011
Oh, that's really good.

20:14.079 --> 20:15.946
Yeah.

20:16.014 --> 20:17.314
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

20:17.382 --> 20:18.549
Immensely.

20:19.984 --> 20:22.186
Well,

20:22.254 --> 20:25.122
that's the reason why I spent too
much time down there, I think.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.291
And drooled all
over the phone, and...

20:30.929 --> 20:34.932
You know, this stuff just... It happens.
It just... It's okay. I just...

20:34.999 --> 20:37.601
I wish you hadn't done
it on our anniversary.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.070
I wish I hadn't done it at all.

20:39.137 --> 20:42.406
You know,
because this is the woman

20:42.474 --> 20:44.475
I like spending
time with, you know?

20:44.543 --> 20:47.178
Do you remember the first
time I told you I loved you?

20:48.447 --> 20:49.947
When was that?

20:50.014 --> 20:53.117
I don't remember,
I was hoping you did.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.652
I'm kidding. Nineteen years ago.
Do you remember?

20:55.720 --> 20:57.959
The front porch of your parents' house.
That summer place they had.

20:57.989 --> 21:00.257
Sitting out there, summertime.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.664
Your old man comes crashing out
of that screen door with a saber.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.295
Chases me off the porch.

21:04.362 --> 21:06.197
What's the matter
with him, anyway?

21:09.134 --> 21:11.535
I never thought I would
see you again that night.

21:14.839 --> 21:15.906
You just did it.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.641
Now what did I do?

21:17.709 --> 21:20.215
You just looked at me the way I
wanted you to look at me last night.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.546
When, wait...
Which look? This one?

21:22.614 --> 21:24.582
No.

21:24.649 --> 21:27.129
Hold it. Wait, wait. It was... I
know it was in there, hold on.

21:28.386 --> 21:29.786
No.

21:29.854 --> 21:31.222
How about this?

21:34.759 --> 21:35.826
No.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.531
I prefer this.

22:01.085 --> 22:03.020
So, I hear you're
pretty good with Mustangs.

22:03.087 --> 22:05.556
What do you say
you work on mine?

22:07.992 --> 22:09.893
Yeah, I'd like that.
