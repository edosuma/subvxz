00:01.722 --> 00:06.698
I know who you are
Sergeant Baxter. I know... everything.

00:06.818 --> 00:09.729
Sergeant Baxter's killer was this man,
Leo Kamali.

00:09.849 --> 00:13.507
If you boys want Kamali your're going
to have to take him from Miguel Gomez.

00:13.627 --> 00:14.838
He's running his own cartel.

00:14.958 --> 00:17.769
Kmali's key to moving the
cartels money out of the country.

00:17.889 --> 00:20.778
- Damien.
- Rebecca.

00:20.898 --> 00:23.852
Who betrayed us? What does the name
Sebastian Gray mean to you?

00:23.972 --> 00:25.390
He was with MI6.

00:25.510 --> 00:27.169
Zero! We got the package.

If he hadn't have,
you wouldn't be here.

05:34.947 --> 05:37.449
"That asshole" being Kamali?

05:37.483 --> 05:39.584
Yeah.

05:41.421 --> 05:43.355
Who fuckin' does that?

05:43.389 --> 05:47.292
He just found you're
a Mossad agent.

05:47.326 --> 05:49.761
If it were me...

05:49.796 --> 05:51.663
You would have let me die.

05:51.697 --> 05:54.132
Yeah.

05:54.167 --> 05:56.635
Yeah.

05:56.669 --> 05:59.137
Me, too.

05:59.172 --> 06:01.606
You see?

06:01.641 --> 06:05.143
That's why we're
made for each other.

06:10.917 --> 06:13.351
I have to go.

06:13.386 --> 06:14.619
Fuck. Really?

06:23.096 --> 06:25.397
Rebecca.

06:25.431 --> 06:27.365
How long till they get here?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.800
Who?

06:28.835 --> 06:32.504
That Mossad team that
you're waiting for.

06:35.174 --> 06:37.275
Don't bullshit me.

06:38.644 --> 06:41.179
I know that Kamali's
still in this town.

06:41.214 --> 06:43.348
Otherwise you wouldn't
be here with me.

06:43.382 --> 06:45.350
Maybe I want
to be here with you.

06:45.384 --> 06:47.853
Yeah.

06:47.887 --> 06:50.989
Well, this is a Mossad mission.

06:51.023 --> 06:54.059
You crashed my party, remember?

06:54.093 --> 06:56.027
Yeah.

06:56.062 --> 06:58.196
When do they get here?

06:58.231 --> 06:59.731
24 hours.

06:59.765 --> 07:02.200
Shit.

07:02.235 --> 07:04.236
Yeah.

07:04.270 --> 07:05.871
It'll be too late.

07:05.905 --> 07:08.907
He really will have
gone by then.

07:10.343 --> 07:12.677
Unless, of course,
you and me team up,

07:12.712 --> 07:14.746
together,

07:14.780 --> 07:17.048
and double our chances
of getting him.

07:22.522 --> 07:25.056
He's got a safe deposit box

07:25.091 --> 07:28.193
in a bank in every city
he operates in.

07:28.227 --> 07:32.664
Dead-drops for intel, cash,
passports, and a list of safe houses.

07:32.698 --> 07:34.633
He will be in one
of those houses,

07:34.667 --> 07:37.903
waiting for Gomez to get
him across the border.

07:37.937 --> 07:41.873
We get the safe deposit
box, we get Kamali.

07:41.908 --> 07:43.508
Nice.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.343
What are you so happy about?

07:45.628 --> 07:47.595
Because...

07:47.630 --> 07:49.631
we're going to rob a bank.

07:49.665 --> 07:50.965
We're going to do what?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.201
It's not
really a bank.

07:53.235 --> 07:56.004
The safety deposit boxes are under
the Central Stock Exchange.

07:56.038 --> 07:57.972
You kidding me?
You told me it was a bank.

07:58.007 --> 08:01.276
It has a vault. You still
get to play bank robber.

08:01.310 --> 08:02.877
Awesome.
That's all I needed.

08:02.912 --> 08:04.345
What?

08:04.380 --> 08:06.581
You didn't play cops and
robbers when you were a kid?

08:06.615 --> 08:08.616
Yeah.
Then let me guess.

08:08.651 --> 08:10.552
You played the cop,
didn't you, Michael?

08:10.586 --> 08:12.554
Well, now you got to play the robber.
So you in or out?

08:12.588 --> 08:14.022
If this is what keeps us
from telling Locke

08:14.056 --> 08:15.290
that we've lost Kamali,
then I'm in.

08:15.324 --> 08:18.327
Bingo. Right! We're
robbin' a bank.

08:18.447 --> 08:19.794
It's your town. How
do you want to do it?

08:19.829 --> 08:21.696
Well, you know
Miguel Gomez already.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.364
Yeah, loves cats

08:23.399 --> 08:24.766
and he's great with an RPG.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.801
And this is his brother, Raoul.

08:26.836 --> 08:29.437
He didn't win the Gomez
family genetic lottery.

08:29.472 --> 08:31.840
Cocaine addict with a heart
condition, but still,

08:31.874 --> 08:35.109
thanks to big brother, president
of the Central Stock Exchange.

08:35.144 --> 08:38.413
Stick a gun in his fat gut and
he'll walk us through security.

08:38.447 --> 08:40.849
That's your plan?
To walk in?

08:40.883 --> 08:43.351
Do we have time
to dig a tunnel?

08:43.385 --> 08:44.752
It's Sunday.

08:44.787 --> 08:46.888
Minimal bodies on the ground.
Keeps it simple.

08:46.922 --> 08:48.756
Does Raoul have any protection?

08:48.791 --> 08:50.758
- Two bodyguards and a driver.
- That's light.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.927
That's 'cause everybody
knows who his brother is.

08:52.962 --> 08:56.898
Sundays he always walks his ugly-ass
dog in the Simon Bolivar Park.

08:56.932 --> 08:58.533
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument,

08:58.567 --> 09:01.503
that something does actually go wrong
and the real police come running.

09:01.570 --> 09:03.304
I'm not shooting some cop
just for doing their job.

09:03.339 --> 09:05.306
This is Colombia.

09:05.341 --> 09:07.342
The police are never
the first people you call.

09:07.376 --> 09:09.344
No. Everyone knows
it's the Ghostbusters.

09:09.378 --> 09:11.179
- You're funny. Ha ha ha!
- You guys talk too much.

09:11.213 --> 09:13.314
Enough. Please.

09:13.349 --> 09:15.450
- Martinez?
- Thank you.

09:15.484 --> 09:17.619
If something goes wrong,
there'll be a private

09:17.653 --> 09:20.088
military response team
heading your way.

09:20.122 --> 09:22.624
Just another
cartel-owned company.

09:22.658 --> 09:25.560
Now, these boys bust through before
the cops even hear about it.

09:25.594 --> 09:27.161
You don't want
to fuck with them.

09:27.196 --> 09:29.898
Yeah, well, we won't have to
if it goes according to plan.

09:29.932 --> 09:31.499
'Cause it will go
according to plan.

09:31.534 --> 09:33.835
It's a bank robbery. They
never go wrong, do they?

09:53.722 --> 09:56.190
You took your time.

09:56.225 --> 09:58.726
I've been busy.
Keep walking.

09:58.761 --> 10:00.695
You're faintly desperate,

10:00.729 --> 10:03.164
but I don't think you're
going to shoot me.

10:03.198 --> 10:06.200
Put a bullet through your leg
if you try to run again.

10:06.235 --> 10:09.203
I'm flattered you think
I could outrun you.

10:09.238 --> 10:11.739
I heard the French
were looking for you.

10:11.774 --> 10:14.275
We came to an agreement.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.744
What about you?
Section 12?

10:16.779 --> 10:18.680
20.

10:18.714 --> 10:22.450
The bluntest of their instruments.
What do you want with me?

10:22.484 --> 10:26.354
Found your name in a book of matches
on a man who was trying to kill me.

10:26.388 --> 10:27.855
Ha ha ha ha!

10:27.890 --> 10:29.824
I imagine there's more
than one hired killer

10:29.858 --> 10:32.026
in Beirut with my name
in his pocket.

10:32.061 --> 10:34.462
Did you give me up?

10:34.496 --> 10:36.965
I have enough blood
on my conscience.

10:36.999 --> 10:39.367
Whoever betrayed you,
it wasn't me.

10:59.588 --> 11:01.356
Hola.
Hola.

11:14.136 --> 11:16.304
I wouldn't, fat man,

11:16.338 --> 11:18.806
unless you got a puncture
repair kit ready.

11:19.339 --> 11:21.081
Do you have any idea who I am?

11:21.201 --> 11:23.311
Oh, we know exactly
who you are.?

11:25.881 --> 11:27.215
Help!

11:33.622 --> 11:36.457
Come on. Let's take a walk.
Come on.

11:36.492 --> 11:38.926
Damn! You're good.

11:38.961 --> 11:40.995
Practice.
Ha ha!

11:41.030 --> 11:42.897
Excuse me.

11:44.633 --> 11:47.435
I've been
tracking Leo Kamali.

11:47.469 --> 11:49.337
Leo Kamali's
a property developer.

11:49.371 --> 11:52.340
Kamali is a money man; without
the cash he launders,

11:52.374 --> 11:54.842
Al-Zuhari and his followers
would be nothing but

11:54.877 --> 11:56.844
a bunch of angry Arabs

11:56.879 --> 11:59.814
burning flags outside
western embassies.

11:59.848 --> 12:02.517
Sorry, I can't help you.
I'm out of the game.

12:02.551 --> 12:04.152
Bullshit.

12:04.186 --> 12:06.220
You're here, you're
in it, selling

12:06.288 --> 12:07.989
whatever information
you can dig up

12:08.023 --> 12:09.957
to just about anyone
who'll pay for it.

12:09.992 --> 12:11.826
Do I disgust you?

12:11.860 --> 12:15.329
Is it my lack
of loyalty or honor?

12:15.364 --> 12:18.066
Name one government
or nation that has any.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.734
Am I supposed
to do it on my own?

12:19.768 --> 12:23.271
You have built this world...

12:23.305 --> 12:26.074
you and your kind.

12:26.108 --> 12:27.575
Oh, I see.

12:27.609 --> 12:30.011
I suppose that means
you have scruples.

12:30.045 --> 12:32.714
And what would you do to get to
the truth you're looking for, eh?

12:32.748 --> 12:35.216
Shoot an old man in the leg?

12:35.250 --> 12:38.352
You know what I see when
I look at you, Rachel?

12:38.387 --> 12:41.422
I see a girl who is lost,

12:41.457 --> 12:44.459
on the edge, and you
should trust me on this

12:44.493 --> 12:46.461
because I've seen it
all before.

12:46.495 --> 12:50.145
The same people who sent you out here
sent Leatherby out 10 years ago...

12:50.265 --> 12:51.365
You know Leatherby?

12:51.400 --> 12:53.301
What do they say about him?

12:53.335 --> 12:56.804
How do they explain how
a soldier of his caliber

12:56.839 --> 13:00.374
suddenly switches sides
and works for the enemy?

13:00.409 --> 13:02.577
If you carry on
along this path,

13:02.611 --> 13:04.712
it'll happen to you.

13:04.747 --> 13:07.682
All I want you to tell me

13:07.716 --> 13:11.719
is whether or not it was Al-Zuhari
who sent his men to kill me.

13:11.754 --> 13:12.854
Tsk.

13:12.888 --> 13:14.856
That's the wrong question...

13:14.890 --> 13:17.859
Well, why don't you tell me
what the right one is?

13:17.893 --> 13:21.429
Six intelligence officers have
been killed in the last 3 months.

13:21.463 --> 13:24.599
Car bombings, kidnappings,
assassinations.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.468
This is a systematic
cleansing of the closet.

13:27.503 --> 13:31.405
Al-Zuhari is targeting people
specifically who are dangerous to him.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.840
People like you.

13:32.875 --> 13:36.377
It's what Al-Qaeda did
before 9/11.

13:36.411 --> 13:39.380
So something's coming.

13:39.414 --> 13:41.482
What?

13:48.457 --> 13:50.958
A couple of weeks ago,
I heard a whisper

13:50.993 --> 13:54.362
about a man looking for intel
on western military bases.

13:54.396 --> 13:56.798
What intel? Which bases?

13:56.832 --> 13:58.766
All of them, everything:

13:58.801 --> 14:01.702
Materiel, personnel,
artillery, schedules.

14:01.737 --> 14:05.740
You know, I asked myself,
I said, "Sebastian...

14:05.774 --> 14:09.243
"the real value here
is not the intel,

14:09.278 --> 14:13.247
it's knowing who really
wants this information."

14:13.282 --> 14:16.784
So I put myself up as a seller.

14:16.819 --> 14:19.053
I let it be known that I
had what they wanted.

14:19.087 --> 14:21.088
So what happened?

14:21.123 --> 14:22.757
What happened?

14:22.791 --> 14:26.627
Al-Zuhari's men snatched
me off the street,

14:26.662 --> 14:29.597
bundled me into the trunk of a
car, and drove me for 3 hours

14:29.631 --> 14:31.966
into the Bekaa Valley to one
of their training camps.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.569
You met Al-Zuhari?
He's here?

14:34.603 --> 14:37.805
Nobody meets him, not anymore.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.242
His people gave me
3 weeks to deliver.

14:42.644 --> 14:44.078
But you won't.

14:44.112 --> 14:46.013
I can't.

14:46.048 --> 14:48.516
I don't have what they want...

14:48.550 --> 14:51.552
but now you know
that Al-Zuhari

14:51.587 --> 14:54.555
is targeting western
military bases.

14:54.590 --> 14:56.424
They'll kill you.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.926
Well,

14:58.961 --> 15:02.496
but I've always played
by my own rules.

15:02.531 --> 15:05.266
You could run.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.634
Where to?

15:06.668 --> 15:09.604
Least I can get a decent
game of backgammon here.

15:09.638 --> 15:11.772
Come in with me.

15:11.807 --> 15:15.743
Help us find
Al-Zuhari's base.

15:15.777 --> 15:18.312
You're a brave thing,
aren't you?

15:19.715 --> 15:21.849
I had a daughter...

16:05.894 --> 16:08.329
Oh, fuck! Shit!

16:20.208 --> 16:22.677
Ever get that feeling
you outstayed your welcome?

16:28.650 --> 16:31.319
Well, he's
giving us nothing.

16:33.288 --> 16:36.157
Always was a little
heavy on the gas.

16:36.191 --> 16:37.591
Get in.

16:37.626 --> 16:39.827
There's a plane standing by.

16:39.861 --> 16:42.063
We're off to Colombia.

16:42.097 --> 16:43.998
Gray is dead.

16:44.032 --> 16:46.567
He knew that Al-Zuhari
was up to...

16:46.601 --> 16:48.536
Take a breath, Major.

16:48.570 --> 16:51.172
Debrief in the air.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.684
Don't mention it.

17:05.554 --> 17:08.089
I've always
wanted to rob a bank.

17:08.123 --> 17:11.058
It's not a bank,
Scott, it's an exchange.

17:11.093 --> 17:13.527
Out, fat man.

17:13.561 --> 17:15.663
I told you
there's no money here.

17:15.696 --> 17:19.099
- Yeah, we don't want your money.
- No? Then what?

17:26.340 --> 17:30.244
OK, you need to get him to punch
in his security code on the way in.

17:30.278 --> 17:32.747
When you get down to the vault,
it's voice recognition.

17:32.781 --> 17:36.183
You put in the code, we're gonna go in.
Any fuss, we'll kill you.

17:40.455 --> 17:42.456
The fucking number,
Humpty Dumpty.

17:42.491 --> 17:44.825
You think that helps?
Probably not.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.761
It makes me feel good.

17:48.230 --> 17:51.098
- Here you go. See? And it works.
- Zero, we're in.

17:57.806 --> 18:00.808
OK, the vault's down
the escalator ahead of you,

18:00.842 --> 18:02.777
and there's one guard
at the desk.

18:26.334 --> 18:29.070
We're gonna take that
escalator to your right.

18:38.413 --> 18:40.514
Keep moving, fat man.

18:42.984 --> 18:45.019
What are you slowing down for?

18:45.053 --> 18:46.854
All right, voice
recognition. Speak.

18:46.888 --> 18:48.489
No.

18:51.493 --> 18:53.594
Come on.

18:57.332 --> 18:59.467
Don't fuck with me, fat man.

19:00.702 --> 19:01.635
Aah!

19:01.670 --> 19:03.504
Speak.

19:08.443 --> 19:10.878
Raoul Gomez.

19:15.217 --> 19:17.284
Heads up.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.725
Turistas.

19:24.759 --> 19:26.827
Hi.

19:26.862 --> 19:30.030
Perhaps I can be
of some service to you.

19:30.150 --> 19:33.708
__

19:33.828 --> 19:35.584
_

19:35.704 --> 19:38.001
Ah, poquito.

19:38.121 --> 19:40.513
_

19:41.550 --> 19:43.448
_

19:46.730 --> 19:51.633
_

19:51.753 --> 19:54.188
Hmm?

19:54.222 --> 19:57.358
There's no parking here.
Move away.

19:57.392 --> 19:59.860
Sorry, officer.

19:59.895 --> 20:02.363
Ha ha ha ha!

20:07.969 --> 20:10.562
Which one's Kamali's?

20:10.682 --> 20:13.704
_

20:14.242 --> 20:16.110
Kamali's.

20:16.230 --> 20:17.693
_

20:17.813 --> 20:19.413
I know you know him.

20:19.447 --> 20:22.416
Ah, it's you.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.909
You treacherous fucking whore!

20:26.029 --> 20:26.954
Aah!

20:26.988 --> 20:29.390
Which one's Kamali's?

20:29.424 --> 20:32.126
Which one?
You don't know him!

20:32.160 --> 20:34.028
If I betray Leo Kamali,

20:34.062 --> 20:36.897
not even my brother
could protect me.

20:36.932 --> 20:38.866
And you don't know me,
so in 10 seconds,

20:38.900 --> 20:41.468
I'm gonna redecorate this vault
with 50 shades of gray matter.

20:41.503 --> 20:44.471
10...9...8...

20:44.506 --> 20:46.240
7...6... Mike!

20:46.274 --> 20:48.642
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

20:48.762 --> 20:50.454
_

20:50.574 --> 20:52.494
_

20:52.614 --> 20:54.582
Aah!

20:54.616 --> 20:56.784
Sorry, mate.

20:56.818 --> 20:58.586
Zero, we've been made.

20:58.620 --> 21:01.155
A guard raised the alarm.
How long have we got?

21:01.189 --> 21:02.923
Response time normally
4 minutes.

21:02.958 --> 21:04.592
Shit.

21:04.626 --> 21:06.594
All right, where was I?

21:06.628 --> 21:08.762
6...5...
Please.

21:08.797 --> 21:10.164
4...

21:10.198 --> 21:11.365
3...

21:11.399 --> 21:12.499
2...

21:12.534 --> 21:14.902
1. Which one was it?
Huh?!

21:14.936 --> 21:16.971
Ah! Shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:18.506 --> 21:20.107
Fuck!

21:20.141 --> 21:22.476
- What the fuck's happening?
- You've given him a heart attack!

21:22.510 --> 21:24.912
I didn't fuckin' mean it!
Yeah! I didn't mean it!

21:24.946 --> 21:27.448
Oh, no, it's not like he's
a likely candidate, is he?

21:27.482 --> 21:30.851
Fuck, Scott! Zero, we've got a
little problem with the big guy.

21:30.885 --> 21:32.586
Well, what the fuck
happened to Raoul?

21:33.989 --> 21:35.422
All right, he's unconscious.

21:35.457 --> 21:39.059
Zero, can you hack
into the exchange's database?

21:39.094 --> 21:40.761
I can't hack in
before they come.

21:40.795 --> 21:42.963
He's the only link
we have to Kamali.

21:42.998 --> 21:45.332
- Well, then you better wake him up.
- Fast.

21:45.367 --> 21:47.268
- You're gonna have to revive him.
- Me?

21:47.388 --> 21:48.018
Why?

21:48.138 --> 21:49.670
Because you gave
him the heart attack!

21:49.704 --> 21:51.472
Yeah, well, I didn't mean to.

21:51.506 --> 21:52.940
I did her.
It's your turn.

21:52.974 --> 21:56.510
Her, not a 200-pound coke-snorting
gorilla with halitosis, Damien.

21:56.544 --> 21:57.478
Queen and country, Michael.

21:57.512 --> 21:58.679
- That's all I'm saying.
- Fuck!

21:58.713 --> 22:00.214
You've got
a bigger problem than that...

22:00.248 --> 22:01.582
X-rays inbound.

22:01.616 --> 22:03.884
Ohh! I'll do it.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.988
Oh, my God,
that's disgusting.

22:09.357 --> 22:12.226
I'm trying
to initiate hack protocols.

22:15.096 --> 22:17.965
OK, I've got nothing
under "Kamali."

22:17.999 --> 22:20.000
Give me a name,
I'll give you a number.

22:20.035 --> 22:21.769
What's his mother's name?

22:21.803 --> 22:23.237
Lisa Cooper.

22:23.271 --> 22:26.340
Father... Youssef Kamali.

22:26.374 --> 22:27.941
Negative... no Lisa,

22:27.976 --> 22:29.843
no Cooper, no Youssef.

22:29.878 --> 22:31.578
Come on! Wake up!

22:31.613 --> 22:32.579
Two minutes.

22:34.649 --> 22:36.984
Wait. Esther.

22:37.018 --> 22:38.952
Try Esther.

22:38.987 --> 22:40.988
- He likes the name.
- You kidding me?

22:41.022 --> 22:43.324
You guys like to
talk baby names?

22:43.358 --> 22:44.792
Negative.

22:44.826 --> 22:46.560
It has to be.

22:46.594 --> 22:48.095
What does it mean?

22:48.129 --> 22:49.463
Star.

22:53.435 --> 22:56.337
Yep, got it.
John Charles Star. 553.

22:56.371 --> 22:57.805
553, 553.

22:57.839 --> 22:59.506
Right there.
Yep, there it is.

22:59.541 --> 23:03.177
Let's go, buddy.

23:07.749 --> 23:11.385
Be advised, armed APCs
arriving, your location.

23:15.323 --> 23:17.257
Come on, Mike.

23:17.292 --> 23:19.593
He's gone.

23:19.627 --> 23:20.861
You kidding me?

23:20.895 --> 23:23.615
One problem at a time.
Come on, Michael.

23:30.939 --> 23:32.339
Get out now.

23:32.374 --> 23:34.241
Fuckin' never goes
wrong, does it, Scott?!

23:34.275 --> 23:35.776
- Robbing banks is fucking great!
- For fuck's sake!

23:35.810 --> 23:36.944
Shut up!

23:36.978 --> 23:38.779
- Fuck! Hey!
- Fuck it!

23:38.813 --> 23:40.114
Now, look at that!

23:40.148 --> 23:41.615
Nice.

23:41.649 --> 23:43.417
Bloody hell.

23:43.451 --> 23:46.787
You know, if this soldiering thing doesn't
work out, maybe you could be a doctor.

23:46.821 --> 23:48.322
- Thinking about it.
- Anything?

23:48.356 --> 23:49.790
Yeah, possibly.

23:49.824 --> 23:51.792
Zero, we're coming
out right now.

23:51.826 --> 23:54.461
Roger.
Front of the building.

23:56.164 --> 23:59.133
All right, go, go.
Ready? Moving.

23:59.167 --> 24:01.702
See ya, fat man.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.688
Zero, I've got visual on you.

24:18.808 --> 24:21.057
Be aware.
X-rays in position.

24:23.892 --> 24:27.428
Fuck! Mike, we got a lot of
open ground, a lot of numbers.

24:27.462 --> 24:29.196
Let's smoke it up.

24:29.230 --> 24:30.898
In there.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.268
Fuckin' smoke.

24:34.302 --> 24:37.171
Rebecca, once we go,
we got to keep moving.

24:37.205 --> 24:38.639
You copy that?

24:38.673 --> 24:40.274
Yes.

24:45.313 --> 24:47.981
Hey, Damien, move it.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.135
Move! Stay down!

25:17.512 --> 25:20.147
Stay down!
Stay down!

25:23.051 --> 25:25.152
Goddamn it!

25:31.459 --> 25:33.393
Mike!

25:34.963 --> 25:36.029
- Mike!
- Yeah!

25:36.064 --> 25:38.699
You all right? Did you get hit?
You OK?

25:38.733 --> 25:40.901
Yeah, I just bit my fucking tongue!
Now move!

25:40.935 --> 25:43.337
- Movin'! Movin'!
- I'm movin'!

25:47.442 --> 25:50.043
Down! Stay the fuck down!

25:50.078 --> 25:51.378
Stay down!
Shit!

25:59.554 --> 26:01.688
Get ready
to move, Michael!

26:01.723 --> 26:03.524
Mikey!

26:06.227 --> 26:07.661
Go!

26:18.940 --> 26:20.340
Go!

26:23.711 --> 26:25.279
Rebecca, move!

26:33.721 --> 26:35.722
No!

26:35.757 --> 26:38.058
No!

26:38.092 --> 26:40.327
No, no.

26:40.361 --> 26:43.263
No!

26:43.298 --> 26:44.498
No, no, no, no.

26:44.532 --> 26:45.966
No.

26:50.171 --> 26:51.638
Move!

26:51.673 --> 26:54.074
Shh, shh.

26:54.108 --> 26:57.978
Water. Water. Water.

27:06.321 --> 27:08.388
Here. Come on.

27:08.423 --> 27:10.390
Come on. All right? No, no.

27:10.425 --> 27:12.926
Water? No, no, no. No.

27:12.961 --> 27:15.562
You don't need to do that.

27:15.682 --> 27:19.312
_

27:19.432 --> 27:23.519
_

27:23.639 --> 27:26.485
_

27:34.885 --> 27:38.065
_

27:42.490 --> 27:44.758
Shh, shh.

27:46.127 --> 27:48.095
- Damien?
- Yeah.

27:48.129 --> 27:50.731
- I'm here.
- I can't see.

28:16.924 --> 28:18.158
We got to move!

28:18.192 --> 28:19.926
- I know!
- Come on!

28:19.961 --> 28:21.395
Scott,

28:21.429 --> 28:23.096
we got to move.

28:23.131 --> 28:25.132
If you want to bring her,
we'll bring her.

28:25.166 --> 28:26.366
She's gone, Mike.

28:26.401 --> 28:28.969
She's gone. Here.

28:29.003 --> 28:32.172
You take this and you
find something useful!

28:34.042 --> 28:36.009
- Go!
- We're leaving them?

28:36.044 --> 28:38.679
If this gets us Kamali,
that's all that counts.

28:45.286 --> 28:46.920
Fuck you!

28:46.954 --> 28:48.188
Let's move!

28:59.767 --> 29:03.070
Get the fuck out of the car!
Get the fuck out of here!

29:03.104 --> 29:05.338
Get out! Get out
of here! Move!

29:05.373 --> 29:07.641
Die!

29:21.723 --> 29:23.123
Keep going! Go!

29:24.861 --> 29:26.765
_

29:31.666 --> 29:33.498
Zero,
we've got X-rays incoming.

29:33.618 --> 29:34.092
Fuck!

29:34.212 --> 29:35.836
- You kidding me?
- Don't quit!

29:37.939 --> 29:39.239
Fuck you!

29:41.809 --> 29:43.910
- Not again!
- Whoa, whoa!

29:43.945 --> 29:47.114
Nice driving!

29:52.687 --> 29:55.756
Once Kamali knows the vault's
been hit, he'll know we're closing in.

29:55.790 --> 29:58.492
Yeah?
Just give me a second.

29:58.526 --> 30:01.394
We better find out
where Kamali is.

30:02.797 --> 30:04.664
Got it.

30:04.699 --> 30:06.533
Safe houses.

30:06.567 --> 30:08.502
Zero, this is Bravo Team.

30:08.536 --> 30:10.971
Zero, this is Bravo Team.
What have you got?

30:11.005 --> 30:14.107
I've got coordinates for 3 safe
houses used by the cartel.

30:14.142 --> 30:15.542
Roger that.

30:15.576 --> 30:17.511
- Which one?
- You know,

30:17.545 --> 30:19.880
Gomez uses construction
as a front.

30:19.914 --> 30:21.815
They put money into
housing developments.

30:21.849 --> 30:24.834
One safe house is a construction site.
That must be it.

30:24.954 --> 30:26.887
Sending the coordinates
through now.

30:26.921 --> 30:28.388
Roger that.

30:28.422 --> 30:31.358
Bravo Team,
we're heading back to the Crib.

30:38.050 --> 30:39.855
You with me, mate?

30:42.136 --> 30:43.737
Yeah.

30:53.214 --> 30:55.987
Check this for anything
I've missed.

30:56.107 --> 30:57.395
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sit-rep?

30:57.515 --> 30:59.119
Bravo Team
has arrived at Safe House.

30:59.153 --> 31:01.555
No further activity.

31:10.898 --> 31:13.500
Go.

31:16.204 --> 31:18.238
Is he inside?
Zero, moving in.

31:30.952 --> 31:32.586
Confirm situation
on the ground.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.655
Bravo, be advised.
X-rays heading in your direction.

31:35.690 --> 31:38.158
Least we know Kamali's here.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.328
Go ahead, bud.

31:43.731 --> 31:45.332
Coming up.

32:16.898 --> 32:18.832
Where's Rebecca?

32:18.866 --> 32:20.867
Your buddy Gomez shot her.

32:20.902 --> 32:23.036
I'm sorry.

32:35.816 --> 32:37.751
Scott, outside.

32:37.785 --> 32:39.219
How many?

32:42.514 --> 32:44.179
Uh, too many.

32:44.299 --> 32:47.155
- There's always too many.
- Yeah, well, this time, there really is.

32:47.275 --> 32:50.297
- Shit.
- Hands behind your back.

32:58.039 --> 33:00.173
Do you hear me?

33:00.207 --> 33:02.175
Send Kamali out!

33:02.209 --> 33:05.245
Maybe I'll let you live!

33:05.279 --> 33:08.181
You have until I smoke this.

33:08.215 --> 33:11.184
Let me go.
Stay here, you die.

33:11.218 --> 33:14.693
- Like Rebecca, for nothing.
- Shut the fuck up!

33:14.813 --> 33:16.636
I swear to God,
you're gonna die first!

33:16.756 --> 33:17.691
Scott, help me cover
these windows.

33:27.935 --> 33:30.036
Coming in.

33:31.939 --> 33:33.673
Fuck.

33:33.708 --> 33:36.142
There, simple. Zero.

33:36.177 --> 33:39.312
We have the asset secure,
but we're surrounded.

33:39.347 --> 33:40.847
Fuck it.

33:40.881 --> 33:42.849
I always knew I'd
go out like this.

33:42.883 --> 33:44.851
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:44.885 --> 33:47.603
- You?
- No.

33:47.723 --> 33:49.646
No, I actually
thought I'd make it.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.074
Pick up my pension, all that.

33:51.194 --> 33:53.197
- Get old and shit?
- Yeah, get old,

33:53.317 --> 33:55.440
bedtime stories
for the grandkids,

33:55.560 --> 33:58.039
tell them how great I was
before my knees went.

33:58.159 --> 33:59.883
Well, then you'd be
lying to them, Michael.

34:00.003 --> 34:01.801
Yeah, well, there is that.

34:01.836 --> 34:04.804
- What about you?
- No.

34:04.839 --> 34:07.207
I never saw it
like that for me.

34:07.241 --> 34:10.976
Zero, what do you want me
to do with the asset?

34:11.012 --> 34:12.712
Here.

34:16.449 --> 34:18.716
Terminate the asset.

34:18.835 --> 34:20.878
Make your peace.

34:20.998 --> 34:21.855
- Now.
- You can't shoot me!

34:21.889 --> 34:22.889
Yeah, I can.

34:22.922 --> 34:24.591
- No, you can't.
- Why is that?

34:24.625 --> 34:26.458
Because I'm CIA.

34:29.063 --> 34:30.929
Bullshit. Shoot him.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.134
Vámonos!

34:34.168 --> 34:36.668
- Start saying your prayers.
- They're coming.

34:36.704 --> 34:39.991
I'm a CIA undercover agent.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.152
My codename is Pegasus.

34:42.273 --> 34:43.610
My controller is
August Van Berg.

34:43.643 --> 34:46.746
I was recruited out of Harvard
Business School 15 years ago.

34:46.781 --> 34:49.949
I'm under deep cover to get
inside Al-Zuhari's network.

34:51.252 --> 34:53.800
- Shit.
-  Call Langley; you have contacts there.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.588
Call them, ask about Pegasus!

34:55.623 --> 34:59.180
Zero, you gettin' that?

34:59.300 --> 35:01.699
We're trying to get a line to
Langley now, but we need more time.

35:01.819 --> 35:03.763
I'm looking for
a handle... Pegasus.

35:03.798 --> 35:05.779
We haven't got time.
Do I shoot him or not?

35:05.899 --> 35:07.624
He's a fucking terrorist.
Go, shoot him, yes.

35:07.744 --> 35:10.162
Yes, I am, and with Langley
behind me, I went rit to the fucking top.

35:12.173 --> 35:15.557
I'm inside now,
and if you shoot me,

35:15.677 --> 35:18.334
you lose the only hope anyone
has of stopping Al-Zuhari.

35:18.454 --> 35:21.648
No one is closer than me. No one else got a
fucking chance of finding out the truth.

35:21.682 --> 35:23.650
And he is planning something.

35:23.684 --> 35:26.397
- Something massive.
- What's he planning?

35:27.655 --> 35:30.224
- I don't know yet.
- How convenient.

35:30.344 --> 35:32.725
But I am close.
I need more time.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.830
That's what we're all here for, right?
To stop the terror?

35:36.864 --> 35:39.370
You guys, I have seen
what you can do,

35:39.490 --> 35:42.166
and it's impressive,
but I can do more my way.

35:42.286 --> 35:43.803
You just have to trust me.

35:49.009 --> 35:51.759
When that door opens,
you are dead. You know it.

35:51.879 --> 35:53.306
But I can get you out of this.

35:53.426 --> 35:56.483
I am the only hope you have
of living out this day!

35:56.517 --> 35:59.268
Untie me and give me
your weapons.

35:59.388 --> 36:01.488
- Oh, fuck off!
- Zero, is he talkin' shit or not?

36:01.522 --> 36:04.724
I don't know. I'm trying to get
through to the right people.

36:04.758 --> 36:06.626
Scott, shoot him.
He killed Baxter.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.595
They were torturing him.

36:08.629 --> 36:10.630
What else could I do?

36:11.966 --> 36:14.630
Yeah? And Rebecca? Huh?!

36:15.569 --> 36:17.437
I wish she hadn't died,

36:17.471 --> 36:20.173
but she took the same risks
that we all do.

36:20.207 --> 36:22.475
If I'm lying, you die.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.544
If I'm telling the truth,

36:24.578 --> 36:27.113
you still die...

36:27.148 --> 36:29.249
just not today!

36:29.283 --> 36:33.553
I am CIA.
You have to trust me.

36:49.637 --> 36:51.804
Negative, negative.
There is no Pegasus.

36:53.157 --> 36:56.007
Bravo, be advised.
He is not CIA.

36:56.127 --> 36:58.208
I repeat, he is not CIA.

36:58.328 --> 37:00.029
You lying mother...

37:06.203 --> 37:08.671
Ohh!

37:08.705 --> 37:11.174
I miss the honesty

37:11.208 --> 37:14.110
of day-to-day police work.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.412
Oy. You OK?

37:16.447 --> 37:17.847
Yeah.

37:17.881 --> 37:19.348
Yeah, you sound like I feel.

37:19.383 --> 37:20.650
Yeah.

37:22.686 --> 37:24.684
I dreamed we were riding
bikes through Mexico.

37:24.804 --> 37:25.378
 Ha!

37:25.696 --> 37:27.500
I can taste margaritas.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.126
That's just the blood
in your mouth, mate.

37:29.246 --> 37:30.293
- Yeah.
- Heh!

37:33.468 --> 37:34.756
A picana.

37:34.876 --> 37:35.932
Aw, shit.

37:35.966 --> 37:39.969
A uniquely
South American device,

37:40.003 --> 37:43.272
based upon the cattle prod,

37:43.307 --> 37:46.843
but manufactured
specifically for...

37:46.877 --> 37:49.239
The torture of human beings.

37:49.359 --> 37:50.446
Exactamente, Raoul.

37:50.481 --> 37:52.014
How you doing, Raoul?

37:52.049 --> 37:53.282
Shouldn't you be
in the hospital

37:53.317 --> 37:55.410
gettin' a breast reduction,
you fat bitch?

37:55.530 --> 37:56.953
And miss this?

37:59.323 --> 38:03.659
High voltage... heh!...
but low current.

38:03.694 --> 38:05.628
And you think
that's gonna make us talk?

38:05.662 --> 38:07.163
You don't think we've
trained for this?

38:07.197 --> 38:09.165
No, no, no, no.
He talks.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.466
You scream.

38:10.501 --> 38:12.001
Heh! Yeah.

38:12.035 --> 38:13.336
And now you.

38:13.370 --> 38:15.208
- Huh?
- Fuck off.

38:15.328 --> 38:18.040
You talk, and your
friend doesn't suffer.

38:18.075 --> 38:21.477
Now what are your intentions
towards me and my people, hmm?

38:21.512 --> 38:23.613
Sorry, Mikey.

38:23.647 --> 38:25.114
Yeah, do it.
Do it, Scott.

38:25.148 --> 38:27.917
I got nothin'
but love, man.

38:27.951 --> 38:31.354
Aah!

38:31.388 --> 38:35.291
Look, I know you're British Intelligence.
Why are you in Colombia?

38:35.325 --> 38:37.360
See, that's where
you're wrong, buddy.

38:37.394 --> 38:39.161
I'm not British,

38:39.196 --> 38:41.130
and he's certainly
not intelligent.

38:41.164 --> 38:44.100
Oh, yes, yeah. Great,
that's fun...

38:44.134 --> 38:46.569
You're a fuckin' drug dealer.

38:46.603 --> 38:48.638
Connect the dots, retard.

38:48.672 --> 38:51.173
- Ha ha!
- "Ha ha!"

38:51.208 --> 38:53.743
OK. Your turn.

38:53.777 --> 38:55.177
No, no, no.

38:55.212 --> 38:57.146
For this one. Heh!

38:57.180 --> 38:59.849
Ha!
I see things between you

38:59.883 --> 39:02.552
and my brother have gotten
a little personal.

39:07.090 --> 39:09.025
What'd you do that for?!

39:09.059 --> 39:11.093
You got to ask him
a question first!

39:11.128 --> 39:13.162
Because it makes me feel good.

39:13.196 --> 39:16.265
Look, you killed
Viktor Ulyanov. Why?

39:16.300 --> 39:17.800
Who?

39:20.370 --> 39:22.405
- Don't touch me,
- Michael! Ohh!

39:22.439 --> 39:24.774
The son of Arkady Ulyanov...

39:24.808 --> 39:27.009
my guest in my fucking house!

39:27.044 --> 39:28.611
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.715
- Mike.
- Yeah?

39:32.749 --> 39:34.216
You can answer
a question now, Michael.

39:34.251 --> 39:36.986
Are you wussing out
on me now, mate, huh?

39:40.357 --> 39:41.324
Hey!

40:05.449 --> 40:08.417
Hey.

40:12.289 --> 40:14.256
What did they tell you?

40:14.291 --> 40:16.225
Nothing.

40:16.259 --> 40:20.129
This is not as much fun
as we'd hoped, hey, Raoul?

40:20.163 --> 40:22.698
Let's just cut
their fucking hands off.

40:22.733 --> 40:24.667
No.

40:24.701 --> 40:27.403
I'll make them talk...

40:29.039 --> 40:31.140
with this.

40:42.986 --> 40:46.622
No, no, no,
no, no, not that one.

40:46.657 --> 40:49.158
Don't be foolish.

40:49.192 --> 40:51.494
They're valuable.

40:51.528 --> 40:53.496
Let me have them.

40:53.530 --> 40:55.998
Look, they hurt my brother.
They killed Viktor.

40:56.033 --> 40:58.501
I'm the one that has to
answer to Arkady, not you.

40:58.535 --> 41:02.471
If you fear him more than you fear
Al-Zuhari, you're making a mistake.

41:02.506 --> 41:05.241
This is my country, Leo.
It's my mistake to make.

41:05.275 --> 41:06.809
Yes, it is.

41:09.513 --> 41:11.647
Whose fuckin' side
are you on, man, huh?!

41:14.785 --> 41:17.887
Give me that, you fat fuck!

41:35.605 --> 41:37.206
Mike!

41:38.875 --> 41:41.744
Hey, Miguel.

41:45.082 --> 41:47.550
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41:47.584 --> 41:50.286
Get out of here.
What, you're staying?

41:50.320 --> 41:52.455
My cover's still good.
The only witnesses are dead.

41:52.489 --> 41:54.056
How about you come back with us

41:54.091 --> 41:56.225
and you explain why
nobody at the CIA

41:56.259 --> 41:58.661
has ever fucking heard of you?!

42:00.097 --> 42:02.631
- That is a great idea, Michael.
- Yeah, thanks.

42:02.666 --> 42:05.267
Sorry, fat man.

42:30.560 --> 42:33.229
2010...

42:33.263 --> 42:35.765
A nerve gas attack

42:35.799 --> 42:38.801
on an American
military base in Doha.

42:38.835 --> 42:41.303
14 servicemen dead.

42:41.338 --> 42:43.806
Al-Zuhari claimed credit.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.442
- Yeah.
- You knew?

42:48.645 --> 42:50.479
And yet you did nothing.

42:50.514 --> 42:53.883
Why do you think
only 14 people died?

43:02.459 --> 43:06.462
Do you care to tell me
why it is exactly

43:06.496 --> 43:09.398
that Langley has
no record of you?

43:09.432 --> 43:11.767
How high does
your clearance go?

43:11.802 --> 43:13.536
High enough.

43:13.570 --> 43:15.971
Apparently not.

43:29.352 --> 43:31.387
Major Dalton,
that's enough.

43:31.421 --> 43:33.422
- What's going on?
- Who the hell is this?

43:33.456 --> 43:35.291
Who am I?
I'm the Deputy Director

43:35.325 --> 43:38.430
of the CIA Counterterrorist
Center, August Van Berg!

43:38.550 --> 43:41.330
And this man, this man
you've been beating

43:41.364 --> 43:43.299
is a hero!
He's an undercover agent!

43:43.333 --> 43:46.168
Why the hell does Langley
have no records of him, then?

43:46.203 --> 43:48.737
There are no records of
deniable deep cover operations!

43:48.772 --> 43:50.239
You should know that!

43:50.273 --> 43:52.575
What does the CIA
think of an inside man

43:52.609 --> 43:56.011
who's helping fund the very terrorism
they're trying to put a stop to?

43:56.046 --> 43:58.547
I don't have to justify
our actions to you, Major.

43:58.582 --> 44:01.283
- What the fuck are you doing here?!
- What am I doing now?

44:01.318 --> 44:04.320
Now I'm trying to figure out how
to get Leo back into the loop

44:04.354 --> 44:06.375
without him being
fucking compromised!

44:06.495 --> 44:08.390
- He's not going back.
- Oh, yes, I am!

44:08.425 --> 44:10.526
Al-Zuhari finds out you've
taken me, he's gone!

44:10.560 --> 44:14.129
He's disappeared! He's in a
cave for the next 3 years!

44:14.164 --> 44:15.297
Hang on.

44:15.332 --> 44:17.800
These are not negotiations.

44:17.834 --> 44:21.737
This is me telling you
how it is gonna go down!

44:24.608 --> 44:27.543
Let me show you something.

44:37.372 --> 44:38.998
Christ, Leo.

44:39.118 --> 44:40.522
So,

44:40.557 --> 44:44.193
this is how it's
"Gonna go down."

44:44.227 --> 44:47.096
We run your asset,
we'll share the intel,

44:47.130 --> 44:49.598
or he gets 25 years to life.

44:51.001 --> 44:53.102
You can't use this.

44:53.136 --> 44:54.904
You try me.

44:54.938 --> 44:57.840
You'll destroy
a decade of work.

44:57.874 --> 45:00.376
I don't want to destroy anything.
I want to use it.

45:00.410 --> 45:02.811
Call it a trade.

45:02.846 --> 45:05.547
You... you think
I can't make a call?

45:06.917 --> 45:09.318
I'll get my bosses
to talk to Whitehall.

45:09.352 --> 45:14.323
You and your band of merry men will be pulling
sentry duty in the fucking Falklands!

45:14.357 --> 45:17.159
At least you know where you
stand with the penguin.

45:17.193 --> 45:18.661
We can't trust him.

45:18.695 --> 45:21.297
You will do as ordered, Major.

45:29.205 --> 45:31.640
OK.

45:31.675 --> 45:34.612
I understand that
you don't trust me.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.278
Why should you?

45:36.313 --> 45:39.715
And, if you decide to,
then you should know

45:39.749 --> 45:42.651
I cannot guarantee you
anything.

45:42.686 --> 45:46.855
Al-Zuhari has a mission
and he has faith,

45:46.890 --> 45:48.991
and he will sacrifice anyone

45:49.025 --> 45:51.593
and everything
to achieve his goals:

45:51.628 --> 45:55.264
you, me, anyone.

45:56.633 --> 46:00.269
You must be prepared
to do the same.

46:07.477 --> 46:10.379
You have tasted
what we must live with

46:10.413 --> 46:12.348
every day.

46:12.382 --> 46:17.386
Until your governments
withdraw from all lands

46:17.420 --> 46:20.823
where you are unwanted,

46:20.890 --> 46:25.961
we and our brothers from
oppressed nations of this earth

46:25.996 --> 46:29.832
will rain the fire
of Allah on your heads.
