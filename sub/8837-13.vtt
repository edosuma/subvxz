GLAD TO SEE YOU.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.316
YOU DON'T WANT
THAT COFFEE.

03:19.657 --> 03:23.160
WHAT YOU NEED
IS...IS A SHOT
OF GIANT KILLER.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.995

04:32.397 --> 04:34.022
WHAT AM I, SOME
KIND OF FARMER

04:34.190 --> 04:37.901
OH, MORE

DUST CLOUD.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.861
NEXT TIME YOU

HOW COME IT IS THAT
EVERY TIME I GET
SOMETHING BROKEN IN

04:57.964 --> 04:59.840
UNTIL IT'S REAL
COMFORTABLE, YOU
WANT TO POUR THE LIFE

05:00.008 --> 05:01.091
OUT OF IT?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.759
SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME IN
THERE WITH IT?

05:02.927 --> 05:04.886
NOT UNLESS YOU
WANT A RECORD
CROP OF BLISTERS!

05:05.054 --> 05:06.096

05:59.275 --> 06:00.650
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.828
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
YOUR BEHAVIOR
SOME OTHER TIME,

06:11.996 --> 06:15.499
BUT RIGHT NOW MR. HANSON
HAS SOMETHING VERY
IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU.

06:15.666 --> 06:17.459
I HAVE JUST
COME FROM THE
EDWARDS' PLACE,

06:17.627 --> 06:21.338
AND THE FEVER
IS TAKING A LOT OF
LIVES IN ELMSVILLE.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.672
SO, AS
A PRECAUTION,

06:22.840 --> 06:25.008
I HAVE DECIDED,
AS THE HEAD OF
THE SCHOOL BOARD,

06:25.176 --> 06:28.929
TO CLOSE THE
SCHOOL UNTIL THIS
THREAT IS OVER.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.847

- YAY!

06:31.015 --> 06:32.391
CHILDREN!

06:32.558 --> 06:33.558
NOW WAIT, WAIT.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.019
CLOSING THE
SCHOOL IS ONLY
PART OF IT.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.646
YOU WILL GO
STRAIGHT HOME

06:37.814 --> 06:40.982
AND YOU WILL NOT PLAY
AT ONE ANOTHER'S
HOMES OR FARMS.

06:41.150 --> 06:45.362
Hanson: THIS IS A
QUARANTINE UNTIL
FURTHER NOTICE.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.781
NOW, ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.032
Miss Beadle:
YES, NELLIE?

WHAT ABOUT
SUNDAY SCHOOL?

06:50.618 --> 06:53.036

IS PASSED.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.541
WELL...

06:57.708 --> 06:58.708
I GUESS THAT'S ALL.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.419

07:14.058 --> 07:15.559
AND STAY THERE.

DO YOU THINK
THE FEVER WILL
COME HERE?

TO GOD THAT IT DOESN'T.

LAURA, YOU CAN
POUR THE MILK.

LET ME HAVE THE TABLET.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.716
I DECLARE,
WITH ALL THE CHILDREN
AND THE SCHOOLWORK,

08:29.884 --> 08:32.135
THIS HOUSE IS GETTING
SMALLER AND SMALLER.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.720
Carrie: I DRAWED
OUR HOUSE.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.347
YEAH, I
CAN SEE THAT.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.265
I SEE YOU ALSO DREW
THE SMOKE FROM
THE CHIMNEY

08:37.433 --> 08:39.726
RIGHT THROUGH
YOUR SISTER'S
ARITHMETIC HOMEWORK.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.978
IF SHE'D ASKED, I
WOULD HAVE GIVEN
HER A SHEET.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.022
NOW I HAVE TO DO
MY ARITHMETIC
ALL OVER AGAIN,

08:44.190 --> 08:45.982
AND I WAS TRYING
TO GET WAY AHEAD.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.860
MM-HMM. WELL, YOU TAKE
THIS TABLET AND GO SIT
DOWN AT THE TABLE,

08:49.028 --> 08:50.153
AND LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS.
GO ON, SIT DOWN.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.988
YOU DID THOSE LIKE
A RUNAWAY FREIGHT TRAIN.

08:52.156 --> 08:56.159
THERE'S 5 PROBLEMS,
YOU HAD 4 OF THEM WRONG.
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY?

08:56.327 --> 08:58.954
WELL, I THOUGHT
IF I GOT ALL
CAUGHT UP,

08:59.121 --> 09:00.163
AND IT WAS
A NICE DAY OUT...

09:00.331 --> 09:01.581
AH, YOU COULD GO
FISHING, HUH?

09:01.749 --> 09:03.792
I TOLD HER SHE'D
HAVE TO HAVE
YOUR PERMISSION.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.252
HALF-PINT,
THE REASON FOR
THIS QUARANTINE

09:05.419 --> 09:07.837
IS TO KEEP ADULTS
AND CHILDREN FROM
BUNCHING UP.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.006
WELL, NO ONE
WOULD BE AT THE
FISHING HOLE.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.342
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT. THERE COULD BE.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.843
WELL, I WOULDN'T
TALK TO THEM.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.264
I WOULDN'T EVEN
GO NEAR THEM.
I PROMISE.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.765
ALL RIGHT.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.016
YOU CAN GO FISHING.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.601
BUT ONLY WHEN YOU GET
ALL THOSE PROBLEMS DONE,

09:21.769 --> 09:22.894
AND CORRECTLY.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.605
YOU MAKE SURE
YOUR MOTHER OR I
CHECK THEM, TOO.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.482
THAT'LL BE
TOMORROW.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.651
WELL, WHAT'S
THE MATTER
WITH TOMORROW?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.152
TOMORROW'S
SATURDAY.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.406
IT'D BE MORE FUN
TO GO FISHING
ON A SCHOOL DAY!

09:35.783 --> 09:38.535
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.078

09:40.246 --> 09:41.746

WAS A FINE OLD MAN

09:41.914 --> 09:43.206
WASHED HIS FACE
IN A FRYING PAN

09:43.374 --> 09:45.834
SURE GOT A LOT
DONE SINCE SUNUP.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.168
SURE DID.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.878
HEY, HOW COME
IT'S SO EASY TO
GET YOU UP EARLY

09:49.046 --> 09:50.505
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO SCHOOL?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.924
SCHOOL AIN'T NOTHING
LIKE WORKING WITH
YOU, PA.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.051
BESIDES, I CAN
LEARN A LOT MORE.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.387
HEY, YOU'D BETTER
NOT LET YOUR MA
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.388
Grace: ISAIAH!

09:58.556 --> 09:59.889
OH, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.808
I DON'T WANT HER
TO SEE THIS TILL
IT'S FINISHED.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.893
COME ON.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.979

10:06.147 --> 10:09.566
IT'S ALICIA!
SHE JUST WOKE UP,

10:10.943 --> 10:12.360
[SOBS]
YES!

10:12.528 --> 10:13.945
STAY HERE.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.421
- PAPA.
- YEAH, BABY.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.466
I'M HERE.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.978
OH, MY GOD.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.565
ISAIAH.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.568
IS IT THE FEVER?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.031
STAY OUT OF HERE.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.127
IT'S MY FAULT.
I BROUGHT IT TO HER.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.213
JUST LIKE I
DONE BEFORE.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.342
SECOND TIME
I BROUGHT IT
TO MY FAMILY.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.638
FIRST TIME,
THEY DIED,
AND I WANTED TO.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.726
LOST MY WIFE
AND MY LITTLE
BABY GIRL.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.522
Isaiah:
THIS IS MY FAULT.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.734
I KNEW I COULDN'T...
I KNEW I COULDN'T GET IT.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.946
THAT'S WHY I WENT
WITH DOC TO ELMSVILLE.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.575
I COULDN'T GET
IT, BUT I COULD
BRING IT HOME.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.452
JUST LIKE
I DONE BEFORE.

11:45.746 --> 11:46.788
JUST LIKE
I DONE BEFORE!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.331
OH, NO, ISAIAH,
YOU DIDN'T!

11:48.499 --> 11:50.959
[SHOUTS]
I SAID STAY
OUT OF HERE!

11:54.338 --> 11:56.339
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MAKE A BUNDLE.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.509
MAKE A BUNDLE.
A CLEAN NIGHTGOWN,
T--TOWELS,

11:59.677 --> 12:01.553
AND, UH, SHEETS.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.016
I'M TAKING HER
TO MY OLD CABIN.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.269
AND YOU AND EVERYBODY
ELSE ARE GOING TO STAY
CLEAR AWAY FROM HER.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.562
BUT I WAS JUST
WITH HER!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.105
THAT DON'T MEAN
YOU GOT IT!

12:12.273 --> 12:13.440
GOD WILLING,
YOU AIN'T.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.109
I'VE HAD IT BEFORE.
I CAN'T GET IT AGAIN.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.820
I'M THE ONE TO
TAKE CARE OF HER,
AND I KNOW HOW!

12:18.988 --> 12:20.780
NOW, STAND BACK SO
I CAN BRING HER OUT.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.793
NOW, BRING
WHAT I TOLD YOU
AND SOME GRUB

12:33.961 --> 12:35.462
AND LEAVE
IT OUTSIDE
THE CABIN.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.714
THEN COME BACK HERE
AND DON'T LET ANYBODY
NEAR YOU OR CARL

12:37.882 --> 12:40.550
UNTIL WE'RE SURE.
SCRUB THIS PLACE CLEAN.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.886
FLOORS, WALLS,
AND EVERYTHING.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.758
I NEED ANOTHER
SHEET OF PAPER.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.426
I JUST
GAVE YOU ONE.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.594
Carrie:
I USED IT.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.887
Laura:
USE THE OTHER SIDE!

13:26.055 --> 13:27.263
Carrie:
I ALREADY DID.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.723
GIVE HER
A PIECE, LAURA.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.517
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO STUDY IF
YOU'RE ARGUING?

13:30.684 --> 13:32.977
Laura: YOU GIVE HER
SOME. SHE ALREADY
USED HALF MY TABLET.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.604
GIRLS, TRY
TO GET ALONG.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.481
Laura:
I AM TRYING.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.069
- GIVE THAT BACK!
- NO, I NEED IT.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.403
- GIRLS!
- CARRIE, COME BACK HERE!

13:42.571 --> 13:44.322
HEY, HEY, HEY!
COME HERE!

13:44.490 --> 13:45.615
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW?

13:45.783 --> 13:47.033
Laura: SHE SWIPED
A SHEET OF MY PAPER.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.160
BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE A TABLET.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.955
YOU DON'T HAVE
A TABLET, HUH?

13:52.122 --> 13:55.917
I THINK IT'S
TIME WE CALLED
A LITTLE RECESS.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.127
NOW, HOW MANY
DAYS HAVE WE
BEEN QUARANTINED?

13:58.295 --> 13:59.546
8 OR 9.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.381
IT SEEMS LIKE
FOREVER.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.465
SO, 9 DAYS
OF QUARANTINE,

14:02.633 --> 14:03.925
AND STILL NO FEVER
IN WALNUT GROVE,

14:04.093 --> 14:05.176
AND I DON'T
THINK THERE'S
GOING TO BE ANY.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.302
SO, INSTEAD OF YOU
ALL SITTING AROUND

14:06.470 --> 14:07.971
THE HOUSE ARGUING
WITH EACH OTHER,

14:08.138 --> 14:09.973
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A NICE WALK OVER TO
THE EDWARDS' PLACE

14:10.140 --> 14:12.141
AND SAY HELLO
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.309
IS IT SAFE?

14:13.477 --> 14:14.727
Charles:
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

14:14.895 --> 14:15.979
THAT WOULD BE
A BLESSING.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.438
Charles: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S SETTLED, THEN.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.648
NO MORE ARGUING?

14:18.816 --> 14:19.983
- RIGHT.
- PROMISE?

14:20.150 --> 14:21.276
- YES.
- YOU PROMISE?

14:21.443 --> 14:22.318
I PROMISE.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.611
OKAY. HEY,
ON THE WAY BACK,

14:23.779 --> 14:24.821
WHY DON'T YOU GIRLS
CHECK UP ON THE HILL?

14:24.989 --> 14:26.030
I SAW SOME NICE
RASPBERRIES UP THERE.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.240
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE
SOME PIE TONIGHT.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.825
Mary: WON'T YOU
GO WITH US, PA?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.286
I'D LIKE TO, BUT I
GOT A LOT OF PLOWING
TO DO, DARLING.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.746
- HAVE FUN.
- BYE-BYE, PA.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.958
I THINK I'LL TAKE
GRACE SOME FRESH BREAD

14:37.126 --> 14:38.459
AND SOME APPLE JELLY.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.044
I'LL BRING
THE APPLE JELLY.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.337
Caroline:
ALL RIGHT.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.672
I WANT TO!

14:42.840 --> 14:43.840
Laura:
I'M GOING TO!

14:44.008 --> 14:47.218
GIRLS, I'LL BRING
THE APPLE JELLY.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.345
YES, MA'AM.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.142
[LAUGHING]

14:59.690 --> 15:01.065

15:02.693 --> 15:03.902
STOP, GIRLS.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.737
Grace: DON'T
COME ANY CLOSER!

15:05.905 --> 15:06.863
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:07.031 --> 15:09.198
THERE'S
BEEN FEVER
IN THE HOUSE!

15:09.366 --> 15:10.450
OH, NO.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.619
Grace: ALICIA
CAME DOWN WITH IT!

15:12.786 --> 15:15.204
ISAIAH TOOK HER UP
TO HIS OLD CABIN!

15:15.372 --> 15:18.708
HE SAYS FOR US NOT
TO LET ANYBODY
COME NEAR US!

15:18.876 --> 15:20.501
ARE YOU AND CARL
ALL RIGHT?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.836
SO FAR!

15:22.004 --> 15:23.254
YOU'RE SURE
IT'S THE FEVER?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.340
Grace:
ISAIAH SAID SO!

15:25.507 --> 15:28.635
HE THINKS HE
BROUGHT IT BACK
FROM ELMSVILLE!

15:28.802 --> 15:31.596
OH, CAROLINE, IT
HAPPENED SO FAST!

15:31.764 --> 15:34.265
WHEN I SAW
HER WITH ALL
THOSE SPOTS, I--

15:34.433 --> 15:36.976
I'VE JUST NEVER
BEEN SO FRIGHTENED
IN ALL MY LIFE!

15:39.897 --> 15:42.065
WE'LL BE PRAYING
FOR HER, GRACE.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.900
THANK YOU, CAROLINE.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.610
WE'RE PRAYING, TOO.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.531
I'LL LEAVE THESE
THINGS FOR YOU.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.625
COME ON, GIRLS.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.238
I'LL HAVE
TO TELL YOUR PA.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.453
WHY DON'T YOU
GET YOUR BUCKETS

16:37.621 --> 16:40.665
AND GO PICK
RASPBERRIES?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.710
YOU THINK
IT'LL BE
ALL RIGHT?

16:43.877 --> 16:44.961
WELL, THERE'S NO
ROAD UP THERE.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.130
I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL SEE ANYONE.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.632
IF WE DO,
WE'LL RUN.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.634
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RUN.

16:51.802 --> 16:55.096
JUST PICK THE
BERRIES AND
COME ON HOME.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.932
- ALL RIGHT.
- WE'LL HAVE PIE TONIGHT.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.407

17:37.806 --> 17:39.223
Mary:
CARRIE!

17:43.187 --> 17:44.604
HOW MANY
HAVE YOU PICKED?

17:46.398 --> 17:47.940
LET ME SEE.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.822
WHAT'S CARRIE DOING?

17:54.990 --> 17:57.992

AS SHE PICKS!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.535
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
CARRIE.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.455
WE HAVE ENOUGH HERE
FOR HALF A DOZEN PIES.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.251
I WAS THINKING.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.879
ALICIA SURE LIKES
RASPBERRIES.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.464
LAURA,
ALICIA'S SICK!

18:11.632 --> 18:12.882
OH, I KNOW THAT.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.051
BUT THAT'S ONE OF
THE THINGS SHE
LIKES ESPECIALLY,

18:15.219 --> 18:17.720
ARE THE ONLY THINGS
THAT TASTE GOOD.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.722
Laura: WE COULD
SPARE A SMALL
PAIL OF BERRIES.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.974
YES, BUT YOU CAN'T
GO TO THE CABIN.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.601
IF I TAKE
THE BACK TRAIL,

18:23.769 --> 18:25.520
CLEAR AWAY FROM
THE OTHER HOUSES,

18:25.687 --> 18:27.188

A SINGLE SOUL.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.731

18:28.899 --> 18:31.067

PUT THE BUCKET DOWN,

18:31.235 --> 18:32.902

18:33.070 --> 18:36.072
THEN ALICIA'LL HAVE
SOMETHING SHE LIKES,
AND NOBODY'D HAVE TO KNOW.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.907
YOU'LL BE
BREAKING QUARANTINE.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.951

OTHER FOLKS.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.744
THAT'S ALL
WE PROMISED.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.412
I'LL JUST
KNOCK AND RUN.

TRYING TO DO!

HAVE COME WITHIN
A MILE OF HERE!

AND STAY OUT!

TRYING TO HELP HER.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.851
AND STAY AWAY
FROM HERE!

21:52.019 --> 21:53.185

21:53.353 --> 21:55.229
WITHOUT YOU SNEAKING
AROUND TRYING TO GET IT!

22:07.451 --> 22:10.578

BUT JUST ONE.

THE BERRIES?

22:19.796 --> 22:21.922
YEAH. YEAH, I
JUST LEFT THEM.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.382
DID YOU SEE ANYBODY?

22:23.550 --> 22:28.346
NO, NO. JUST LEFT
THE BERRIES OUTSIDE
LIKE I PROMISED.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.474

SOMETHING WE COULD
DO FOR ISAIAH.

THE FEVER BACK

23:04.841 --> 23:06.509
FROM ELMSVILLE?

23:06.676 --> 23:09.178
HE COULD HAVE.
I DON'T KNOW.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.680

BLAME HIMSELF,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

23:13.683 --> 23:17.686

TIME HE'S BROUGHT
IT TO HIS FAMILY.

HAPPENS TO ALICIA...
