-Mm-hmm.
-And what-what am I gonna do,

01:01.020 --> 01:02.354

01:02.438 --> 01:04.356
I don't want to do that.

Mm, I'm sure you could just fuck, Le.

-What are you doing?

01:25.044 --> 01:27.588
No, fucking Victor gave away our passes.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.340
-Hey, look.
-Fucking dingleberry.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.424
You called him a what?

01:30.508 --> 01:31.842
-A dingleberry.
-Okay, calm-calm...

01:31.926 --> 01:32.927
Dingle up your asshole,
because he ain't worth shit.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.178
Okay, calm... calm down, calm down.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.554
Look, you'll be able...
we'll figure it out.

01:35.638 --> 01:36.847
Come on, let's just go.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.891
-It's not the end of the world.
It's okay. -Shit.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.644
-SEAN: For you, it's not.
-KUNLE: We're okay.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.688
Hi, class. Sorry I'm late.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.899
(sighs) Whew, goodness.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.776
Okay, so if you've done the reading--

01:48.859 --> 01:50.778
which you should have--

01:50.861 --> 01:53.656
you'd have noticed that there's
a big old trigger warning

01:53.739 --> 01:56.617
next to the syllabus on today's class.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.994
And I know that we're
inches away from spring break,

01:59.078 --> 02:01.831
but if you could just maintain
your focus and respectability

02:01.914 --> 02:04.041
till the end of the day,
I'll be most appreciative.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.043
Okay, so we good to go?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.504
-I found some extra tickets
to Blackout. -Really?

02:08.587 --> 02:09.964
PROFESSOR CLARKE:
So we've been talking about

02:10.047 --> 02:11.882
the power of language,

02:11.966 --> 02:15.553
and today we're going to be
talking about hate speech.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.514
Now, before I go any further,

02:18.597 --> 02:20.307
I just feel like I need to restate

02:20.391 --> 02:21.934
the trigger warning, so are we good?

02:23.519 --> 02:25.354
-(whispers): That's cute.
-Stop.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.983
CLARKE: Yeah, okay, so let's
talk about the infamous...

02:30.067 --> 02:31.485
...N-word.

02:36.031 --> 02:40.411
The word "nigger" has had a
very long and terrible history.

02:40.494 --> 02:46.292
It occupies a unique space in
the modern American vernacular.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.169
The word's so taboo that it's
clearly making a lot of you

02:49.253 --> 02:51.630
feel uncomfortable with me just
saying it right here right now

02:51.714 --> 02:54.800
in a very isolated academic context.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.678
Now, my question is to you lot:

02:57.761 --> 03:02.266
What makes this word so powerful?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.685
Anybody.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.186
Yes.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.273
I mean, because it's racist.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.360
CLARKE: I think we could
all agree it is racist, yes.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.154
But there are many racist,
offensive words.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.655
What makes "nigger" different?

03:16.739 --> 03:18.240
It originates from the Spanish...

03:18.324 --> 03:20.451
Hey. Is that shit even allowed?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.286
It's on the syllabus.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.915
Um, there-there was a...
a trigger warning.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.374
Trigger warning, these nuts.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.376
-That shit is not right.
-CLARKE: And then, of course,

03:29.460 --> 03:31.295
with an "A" at the end, we've got "nigga."

03:31.378 --> 03:33.213
Bro, she keeps fucking saying it.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.924
-KUNLE: Okay. -SEAN: She just
said "nigga" three times.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.175
KUNLE:
But, uh, okay.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.093
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

03:38.177 --> 03:39.845
-Ask her. Inquire about it.
-I-m-I'm not asking her.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.388
-Ask her, Kunle.
-I'm not gonna ask her.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.598
You don't want to ask. Ask her.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.682
She can't answer this question?

03:43.766 --> 03:45.059
She's British.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.727
May-Maybe she just doesn't know.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.687
Give a fuck if she British, boy?

03:48.771 --> 03:50.522
Ask her, why is she teaching a class

03:50.606 --> 03:52.816
on some shit she don't know shit about?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.152
I, um, don't want to put you two

03:55.235 --> 03:58.238
on the spot or anything, but...

03:58.322 --> 04:00.324
you must have something to say.

04:01.951 --> 04:04.370
Please. This is a safe space.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.873
What do you think it is that
keeps this word so powerful?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.003
(bell chiming)

04:14.129 --> 04:15.756
KUNLE:
Look, it was...

04:15.839 --> 04:17.383
Sean, if it bothered you so much,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.051
you could have said something.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.303
You could have said anything.
You didn't say a word.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.596
You just... you just sat there.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.516
Yeah, in silent protest.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.184
-Okay, silent protest.
-BIANCA: Kunle?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.436
Oh, shit. Okay, okay, um... act cool.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.230
-Do I have anything in my nose?
I'm okay? -BIANCA: Kunle.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.524
-Hey. Guys. -Just be cool.
Be cool, Sean. Be cool.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.484
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.486
That was... ooh.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.654
W-Weird.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.322
Fucked-up is what it was.

04:40.406 --> 04:42.992
-BIANCA: She should not have put
you guys on the spot like that. -No.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.327
I'm on the Student Senate,
if you guys want to, like,

04:45.411 --> 04:47.329
start a movement or something.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.540
-Uh...
-But it's totally up to you.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.041
Like, no pressure.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.335
Yeah, no, no, no. No, pressure. We, um...

04:53.419 --> 04:56.338
-We will think about it.
-BIANCA: Cool.

04:56.422 --> 04:58.340
-(Bianca laughs)
-(chuckling): Yeah, uh...

04:58.424 --> 05:00.926
So, uh, you...

05:01.969 --> 05:03.429
So, you going out tonight, B?

05:03.512 --> 05:06.265
Uh, for once, I am.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.975
-Mm. -Yeah, got a pass
to Underground.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.977
-KUNLE: Nice. Nice.
-SEAN: Oh, shit.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.353
Nice. That's really good.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.230
BIANCA:
Yeah. Are-are you guys?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.066
Yeah. Yeah, we're just gonna go
to a couple parties and...

05:16.150 --> 05:17.359
BIANCA:
Cool.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.361
Seven parties, actually.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.405
Are you guys doing a Legendary Tour?

05:21.488 --> 05:23.907
-Mm-hmm.
-BIANCA: Wow, wow, wow.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.744
(laughs) It took me
three weeks of ass kissing

05:26.827 --> 05:28.537
just to get into one.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.621
-KUNLE: Oof.
-Lot of butt.

05:29.705 --> 05:30.706
BIANCA:
So... lot of butt.

05:30.789 --> 05:31.790
-Oh, God. (chuckles)
-Lot of butt.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.000
Good thing you didn't get pink eye.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.334
(Kunle laughs)

05:34.418 --> 05:37.129
-(chuckles)
-From all the ass kissing.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.008
Yeah, it's not really...
it's not really about

05:41.091 --> 05:42.926
the, uh... the-the parties, though.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.970
It's just this inside joke
that-that we've had

05:45.054 --> 05:46.430
-since freshman year.
-Oh.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.932
We actually are gonna be
the first Black men

05:49.016 --> 05:51.643
to complete a Legendary Tour here
at Buchanan.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.228
-Right.
-Is that...

05:53.312 --> 05:55.522
like, something that people keep track of?

05:55.606 --> 05:57.524
-Well, yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.735
SEAN:
See, the Black Student Union,

05:59.818 --> 06:01.945
right, they got this thing
called the Hall of Firsts.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.906
-(trumpet playing)
-You get a fancy plaque

06:03.989 --> 06:06.575
any time that you are the first
Black person to do something

06:06.658 --> 06:08.035
-here at Buchanan.
-KUNLE: Mm-hmm.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.411
Like First Black Newspaper Editor.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.455
SEAN: First Black
Student Government President.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.916
Also, they do things for stuff
that's not due to academics,

06:13.999 --> 06:16.460
like First Black Man
to Step Foot in Omicron,

06:16.543 --> 06:18.003
or first Black woman

06:18.087 --> 06:19.588
to ever even make it
into the Hall of Firsts.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.381
We're gonna make history today,

06:21.465 --> 06:23.592
being the first Black men
to complete a Legendary Tour.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.219
-Right.
-We're actually going to get

06:25.302 --> 06:27.304
-our Blackout passes right now.
-KUNLE: Right.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.806
-Cool. Text me.
-I'll te... I'll text you.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.682
-Okay.
-Bye.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.017
Bye.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.269
(sighs)

06:36.021 --> 06:37.689
She wants your dick, bro.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.816
No, she's just being nice.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.110
Yeah, she is being nice-- to your dick.

06:41.193 --> 06:44.488
("Act Up" by Terry Presume playing)

06:49.201 --> 06:52.121
KUNLE:
Wait, okay, on-on the other hand,

06:52.204 --> 06:54.039
it's a class about blasphemy and taboos.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.041
Like, it's literally called
Blasphemy and Taboos.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.543
-Mm-hmm.
-If we got her fired,

06:57.626 --> 06:59.253
would that be censorship?

06:59.336 --> 07:00.796
'Cause I'm against censorship.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.922
That was some willy-nilly-ass shit.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.173
Like, she didn't have to say it.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.758
She just wanted to. She wanted a reaction.

07:04.842 --> 07:05.968
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.594
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.013
But that was kind of the point, right?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.765
To analyze us.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.518
She wants to analyze
why we reacted that way.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.186
Like, why is it so bad?

07:16.270 --> 07:18.438
Think about this. So, there's a white man.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.357
He's in the woods alone, all right?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.025
He says the N-word. Is it bad?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.735
Wait, your white man goes to the forest

07:23.819 --> 07:25.529
-just to say the N-word?
-Well, no, no. He's never...

07:25.612 --> 07:27.239
He... Okay, think about it.
He's never said it before.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.782
-Uh-huh.
-He will never say it again.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.826
And he doesn't hate us.
He's not, like, that type.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.829
He just wants to just
whisper it quietly to himself.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.831
You, just, you know...

07:35.914 --> 07:37.291
(whispers):
"Nigger."

07:37.374 --> 07:39.334
(laughs) It's fucked-up, dummy.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.003
-What?
-What? That's fucked...

07:41.086 --> 07:42.629
You're such an Oreo, trying to justify it.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.256
I'm not... (groans) I'm not a...

07:44.339 --> 07:45.924
-Okay, think about this...
-Look, look, look. Look, calm down.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.217
You're thinking about it
too much, all right?

07:47.301 --> 07:48.719
It's not that complicated.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.346
We got one rule that we ask
for white people to respect.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.182
-Mm-hmm. -Thou shalt not
say this one word.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.474
-Right?
-Right.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.560
But they don't like for us
to tell them what to do.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.353
So they find loopholes.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.398
So when your white man says
"nigger" in the forest,

08:01.481 --> 08:03.609
he breaketh the covenant, all right?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.903
It's not, like, evil-evil,

08:05.986 --> 08:08.363
like, you know, "rawr,"

KUNLE:
Oh, shit.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.771
-What?
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.022
-Did I lock it?
-What?

17:03.106 --> 17:04.733
Did... No, did I... did I lock it?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.151
My-my-my-my cultures.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.694
I forgot to lock the fridge.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.362
-Oh, um, I got to go back.
-Hey!

17:09.446 --> 17:10.530
Hey, what the fuck is you doing?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.073
-Yes.
-We only got 30 minutes to go pregame

17:12.157 --> 17:13.533
and then make it to Blackout, all right?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.201
Can't you just call one of our lab mates

17:15.285 --> 17:16.786
-and have them do that?
-No, no, no, no.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.372
I need to lock it closed with
the key or else it comes open.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.332
Just... they-they can jam it
with a fork or some shit.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.959
What are you talking about,
"a fork or some shit"?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.461
-Well...
-Wh-What are you talking about?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.712
Just until tomorrow, Kunle.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.130
-Calm the fuck down.
-This is my thesis.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.757
-Okay, I understand.
-All right?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.426
My cultures need to be at the
right temperature and humidity,

17:31.509 --> 17:33.136
or else they will die.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.597
Can't-can't we just skip the pregame?

17:35.680 --> 17:38.683
No. You never skip the pregame, fool.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.727
It's just gonna fuck up
the whole schedule, Kunle.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.188
Okay, okay. Um, you just go without me,

17:43.271 --> 17:44.856
and I will meet you there.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.483
-I'll meet you there.
-Fucking...

17:46.566 --> 17:48.610
No, I... look, I'ma take you, okay?

17:48.693 --> 17:50.445
But we only gonna have
five minutes when we get back

17:50.528 --> 17:52.447
to pregame, change and leave, okay?

17:52.530 --> 17:53.782
Okay, cool.

17:53.865 --> 17:54.866
(keyless lock chirps)

17:54.949 --> 17:56.868
I can make us a Ginnamon Toast Crunch.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.829
It sounds weird, but it is delicious.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.832
Like, we were in the house
one night, and we were baked,

18:02.916 --> 18:05.752
but all we had was the alcohol
and the cereal, and... (laughs)

18:05.835 --> 18:08.296
SEAN: Mother... I know damn well
he didn't leave

18:08.379 --> 18:10.048
-this fucking door open again.
-Hey, hey.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.175
Don't go in there yelling, okay?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.344
Carlos!

18:15.386 --> 18:19.057
Hey! Motherfucker,
my PS4 better still be here.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.021
(Kunle chuckles)

18:26.689 --> 18:28.525
SEAN:
All right, I got the game.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.068
It's cool.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.571
Yeah?

18:33.655 --> 18:35.532
SEAN:
And my shoes.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.081
I got the weed.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.833
KUNLE:
Okay.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.004
Okay.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.924
SEAN:
Anything missing out there?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.677
Um...

18:57.220 --> 18:59.764
Everything here except
Winnie-the-fucking-Pooh.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.393
-So I'm gonna hide his weed...
-Sean. Sean.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.019
What?

19:10.024 --> 19:12.360
SEAN:
The fuck?

19:12.443 --> 19:14.070
KUNLE:
Okay, um...

19:15.071 --> 19:16.823
Okay.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.242
Hello? Hello.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.246
Hey, yo, wake up!

19:23.329 --> 19:25.957
-Hey! Wake up!
-(clapping)

19:26.040 --> 19:27.625
-KUNLE: Okay, okay.
-What the fuck?

19:27.709 --> 19:29.294
Um...

19:30.336 --> 19:31.421
(sighs)

19:31.504 --> 19:33.047
No, hey! Don't touch her.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.884
This could possibly be a crime scene.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.594
Well, we need... Uh, w-w...

19:38.720 --> 19:40.471
KUNLE:
Okay. Okay, she's-she's alive.

19:40.555 --> 19:41.848
-She's breathing.
-(exhales)

19:41.931 --> 19:45.518
Her-her pulse is fast,
but her breathing is slow.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.606
-Okay, okay, okay.
-(Kunle exhales)

19:50.648 --> 19:51.733
All right. Um...

19:51.816 --> 19:52.901
Okay.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.779
KUNLE: We should call...
we should call 911.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.907
Carlos.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.659
Kunle.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.912
Kunle, I'm too high for this shit.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.371
What if he's dead, bro?

20:05.455 --> 20:08.458
-He's not dead. He's not dead.
-All right. Okay.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.667
Go look.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.377
Go see. Go check. Go do whatever.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.837
-Okay. Come on.
-(pats arm)

20:12.921 --> 20:14.881
Me and you, me and you,
me and you, me and you.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.342
I'm-I'm right behind you.
Right behind you.

20:23.181 --> 20:25.642
-You're right behind me?
-Motherfucker, just go!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.518
Los?

20:37.195 --> 20:39.197
(creaking)

20:42.200 --> 20:43.826
(sighs):
Okay.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.453
Hey.

20:45.536 --> 20:46.788
Carlos?

20:46.871 --> 20:48.706
(coughing)

20:48.790 --> 20:51.084
-Hey. Hey, hey.
-(whoops, grunts)

20:51.167 --> 20:52.585
(laughing):
Jesus.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.003
-You got me.
-Right.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.672
I'm-I'm presently at war with the Russians

20:55.755 --> 20:58.007
-and the Persian Empire,
so shit is about to get… -Okay.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.218
Okay, but do you know the girl out here?

21:00.301 --> 21:02.345
Hold on a second. Wait.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.596
Look.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.932
-Hey, hey.
-This is a single-player game.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.767
-You can pause.
-Mess up my sensitivity.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.519
Now, there's a girl on...

21:09.602 --> 21:12.397
Ah, girl problems, huh?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.357
What, is it Bianca? Is it someone I know?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.150
What-what's going on?

21:16.234 --> 21:17.944
Ew.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.279
There is an unconscious
white girl in our living room.

21:22.740 --> 21:23.950
(laughs, burps)

21:24.033 --> 21:25.201
What?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.911
-SEAN: Hey, hey, Kunle!
-(girl retching)

21:26.995 --> 21:28.454
Kunle, Kunle, she's throwing up!

21:28.538 --> 21:29.956
Oh, hey, hey, Kunle!

21:30.039 --> 21:31.499
Kunle, she erupting.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.251
She throwing, bro. She throwing up.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.795
(all groaning)

21:35.878 --> 21:36.963
Who-who is she?

21:37.046 --> 21:39.007
KUNLE:
We-we don't know.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.383
(slurring):
Where's Maddy?

21:40.466 --> 21:42.760
Hey. Hey, hey. What'd you say?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.804
What-what... what did you say?

21:44.887 --> 21:46.347
Can you go tell her I feel really weird?

21:46.431 --> 21:47.807
Ooh, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.058
SEAN:
Hey, stop touching.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.144
-Stop touching.
-No, I cannot stop touching.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.812
Look, we have to keep her on her side.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.189
All right? Or else she could
inhale vomit and die.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.817
Look, just trust me.
I'm first aid certified.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.402
That's... Okay.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.696
Hey, what's your name?

22:01.779 --> 22:03.322
What's your...

22:04.365 --> 22:06.617
Okay. All right, um...

22:07.660 --> 22:09.454
We should call 911, right?

22:09.537 --> 22:11.205
-Yes...
-No, no. Hey, stop. -Yes.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.124
-What? What?
-Stop. Are you fucking crazy?

22:13.207 --> 22:14.625
Do you not know what they'll think

22:14.709 --> 22:15.877
when they come and see this?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.462
They're gonna shoot us and arrest us

22:17.545 --> 22:18.796
for killing this little white girl.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.840
Shoot us and arrest us?

22:20.923 --> 22:22.383
-Yes.
-Come on, man.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.552
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.679
-(groaning)
-Okay, listen.

22:26.763 --> 22:27.889
What the fuck are you...

22:27.972 --> 22:29.932
We don't have to do nothing wrong, Kunle.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.268
Just be in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.519
Which we are!

22:33.603 --> 22:34.812
Down white girl.

22:34.896 --> 22:36.522
House that reeks of weed.

22:36.606 --> 22:40.026
Your fingerprints and DNA
are all over her, Touchy Tim.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.903
And, Carlos, you were here
the whole fucking time.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.321
What's your alibi, huh?

22:43.404 --> 22:44.906
Uh...

22:44.989 --> 22:47.867
Guys, we're just gonna tell 'em
we came home...

22:47.950 --> 22:49.619
-Kunle. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-She was on the floor.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.370
They not gonna listen, all right?

22:51.454 --> 22:53.581
The cops don't know that you're
basically white on the inside.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.083
-Don't start that right now...
-What? I'm being honest.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.959
Bitch, that's honest information.
Don't get mad.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.669
They're not gonna listen.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.588
They're just gonna come in here
and see three Brown guys

23:00.671 --> 23:02.757
hanging over this little white girl.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.801
Do y'all not see how fucked that is?

23:08.304 --> 23:10.306
♪ ♪

23:28.407 --> 23:30.493
CARLOS:
Perhaps we could persuade a friend

23:30.576 --> 23:32.870
to call 911 for us.

23:32.954 --> 23:37.708
Someone a-a little less, um... you know.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.293
What, Brown?

23:39.377 --> 23:40.711
So a white person.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.840
A female would be preferable.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.677
Um, we could... we could call Bianca.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.680
I mean, she cool,
but she don't know all of us that well.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.014
Okay, who knows us?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.975
Um... Asa.

23:54.058 --> 23:57.979
I would rather not put my life
in the hands of my ex.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.731
Plus, she a Black queen.
We need a white girl.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.608
Um... (stammers, chuckles)

24:02.692 --> 24:04.277
It's funny, I-I-I...

24:04.360 --> 24:06.737
I don't know too many
of my white female peers.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.281
It's troubling.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.991
Um...

24:10.074 --> 24:11.534
Oh, oh, we-we could call

24:11.617 --> 24:13.703
-White Sean, the football player.
-Ooh...

24:13.786 --> 24:15.413
Football players never get
in trouble, right?

24:15.496 --> 24:18.040
White Sean, White Sean.
Ooh, come on, White Sean.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.877
-(line ringing)
-Come on.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.295
WHITE SEAN (over phone):
Oh, what's up, Sean?

24:22.378 --> 24:23.921
Hey, hey, White Sean.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.090
-Where are you?
-Uh, I'm actually on

24:26.174 --> 24:28.509
a microbrewery tour with my mom.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.887
-So you're not on campus?
-Nah.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.972
-Fuck. -You know, you know, man,
I didn't think I'd like this...

24:33.055 --> 24:35.808
Um, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, got to go.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.769
Okay, who else can we call?
Come on, come on, come on.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.563
Brian Phan?

24:40.646 --> 24:41.856
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.816
Asians-- they, like,
fucking neutral to police.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.153
No. Brian is in Cabo for break.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.946
SEAN: Oh, fuck, y'all,
we are one percent of the school.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.324
How the fuck don't we know
any white people?

24:51.407 --> 24:53.910
Maybe we just overthinking right now.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.916
Hey. Hey, yo!

24:59.999 --> 25:01.209
Yeah, there she go.

25:01.292 --> 25:04.712
Hey. You got anybody
that you want us to call?

25:04.795 --> 25:07.340
-Or, like, a-a friend or a phone
or something? -(moans softly)

25:07.423 --> 25:09.258
KUNLE:
She cannot be on her back.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.718
-Okay, okay, all right, all right.
-SEAN: The touching.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.637
-It's the touching.
-KUNLE: Come on, come on.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.013
Okay, so what do we know? What do we know?
What do we know?

25:14.096 --> 25:17.433
This girl got drunk
and came here on accident.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.935
Like Goldilocks.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.853
And we're the three bears.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.397
KUNLE:
Please don't. Please don't.

25:23.481 --> 25:25.608
Let's... leave it alone. Leave it alone.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.777
Don't-don't...

25:27.860 --> 25:29.570
SEAN:
All right, and look at what she's wearing.

25:29.654 --> 25:30.988
Anything but clothes.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.907
She was at Omicron.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.785
We could just take her ass back.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.328
KUNLE:
And do what?

25:38.329 --> 25:40.081
What, just-just walk in with her?

25:40.164 --> 25:41.415
No, not walk in with her.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.709
Lay her outside where somebody
can find her and help her.

25:43.793 --> 25:46.837
Your plan is to dump the unconscious girl

25:46.921 --> 25:49.257
outside of the frat party?

25:49.340 --> 25:50.508
Yeah.

-Okay.

34:02.291 --> 34:03.959
CARLOS:
One of us has to go over there

34:04.042 --> 34:06.003
and-and act like a lookout,

34:06.086 --> 34:07.838
make sure that no one interferes
with the plan.

34:07.921 --> 34:10.132
Mm, yeah. Kunle, go see if it's clear.

34:12.426 --> 34:15.012
(indistinct chatter, laughter nearby)

34:29.443 --> 34:31.653
CARLOS:
Okay, okay. Let-let's get in position.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.030
I see him. That's it.

34:33.113 --> 34:35.115
Omicron! (chuckles)

34:38.327 --> 34:40.496
(man grunting, sighing)

34:41.997 --> 34:43.457
Oh, oh, oh.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.501
-Abort. Abort, abort, abort, abort, abort.
-Shit. What the fuck?

34:45.584 --> 34:46.668
(sighs)

34:46.752 --> 34:48.128
How's it going?

34:48.212 --> 34:49.421
(urine splattering)

34:49.505 --> 34:51.089
(grunts) Yes.

34:51.173 --> 34:52.424
(grunts) Come on.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.385
(grunts)

34:55.469 --> 34:56.970
(sighs) Shit.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.722
Hey!

34:59.765 --> 35:01.642
Hey, they're pissing on our sacred totem!

35:01.725 --> 35:03.143
What the fuck?

35:03.227 --> 35:05.145
These Gamma Tau bitches
keep pissing on our totem, bro.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.814
Gamma Tau! (laughs)

35:06.897 --> 35:08.148
Oh, yeah? Hey!

35:08.232 --> 35:09.525
Oh, yeah, you fucking pussy!

35:09.608 --> 35:11.652
-Oh, yeah, you fucking run!
-KUNLE: Oh, shit.

35:11.735 --> 35:12.903
-Oh, shit. (yells)

35:50.107 --> 35:51.650
Shut up. Shut up.
Wh-What are you talking about?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.235
Just...

35:53.318 --> 35:54.820
All right, all right, just...
right here, like that.

All right? Like Professor X.

-Come on, drink up.
-(Emma moans)

36:07.374 --> 36:08.542
Look, I told you that was a bad idea.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.127
We should've just gone
straight to the hospital.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.879
You know what, pull over. I'll drive.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.505
-There you go. -You don't even have
a fucking seat belt on!

36:13.589 --> 36:15.841
-No, no, no. Hmm. -(Emma mumbles)
-SEAN: Man, I never got a seat belt on!

36:15.924 --> 36:17.301
-Let's just get through this.
Calm down. -No, no.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.844
-Pull over, Sean. Pull over.
-Calm-calm the fuck down.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.971
What you gonna do?

36:22.139 --> 36:23.682
-Nothing. Exactly.
-Sean, pull over.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.018
Shut your dumb ass up.
You ain't gonna do nothing.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.477
-KUNLE: Sean.
-I need to pee.

36:27.561 --> 36:28.770
KUNLE:
Pull over.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.565
-I should drive.
-Guys? Guys, uh...

36:31.648 --> 36:35.235
I believe Goldilocks needs to urinate.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.655
Um, she better not pee
in my motherfucking van.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.532
I don't know if she's gonna
be able to hold it. Maybe...

36:40.616 --> 36:43.660
-She better not pee in my car.
-Maybe you should pull over.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.871
SEAN:
I got it. I got it, Kunle.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.290
(Sean and Kunle speaking indistinctly)

36:49.625 --> 36:52.377
SEAN:
Get her out my van. Get her out my van.

-(Kunle and Carlos grunting)
-(Emma whoops)

36:55.255 --> 36:57.090

All right.

36:57.174 --> 36:59.217
(Carlos and Kunle speaking indistinctly)

37:00.302 --> 37:01.428
KUNLE:
Yeah.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.555
Uh, how about that?
You-you pee right here?

37:03.639 --> 37:05.641
-There you go.
-(slurring): This is good.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.935
(Carlos grunts)

37:08.018 --> 37:09.686
-We looked everywhere.
-No, Maddy,

37:09.770 --> 37:10.979
we have not looked everywhere.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.689
And what are you gonna do,
call the cops right now?

37:12.773 --> 37:14.107
We are underage.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.901
Does she have, like,
a Find My Friends or something?

37:15.984 --> 37:17.653
We can... we can track her on your phone.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.488
I don't know. I haven't tried that.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.491
RAFAEL:
There she is.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.494
Wait. That's literally like
a couple blocks from here.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.496
-What the fuck?
-Okay, okay, maybe she just got lost,

37:27.579 --> 37:28.997
so we can go get her.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.874
And I could go with you guys if you want.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.501
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You don't have to do that.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.420
Nah, nah, I mean, like, I-I want to.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.675
Also, if you go a little further,

37:39.758 --> 37:42.970
this neighborhood's, like,
kind of sketchy.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.348
Hold this.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.062
(whispering):
I am so sorry.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.439
RAFAEL (whispering):
It's all good.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.109
-(urine trickling)
-(crickets chirping)

37:57.192 --> 37:59.194
KUNLE:
I'm so fucked.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.365
-I'm so fucked.
-Can't you just...

38:03.448 --> 38:04.366
grow more bacteria?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.909
No.

38:05.993 --> 38:08.245
No, no, I... (chuckles)

38:08.328 --> 38:10.288
I mean, you already got into Princeton.

38:10.372 --> 38:11.707
Can they un-admit you?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.709
Yes, yes, they can.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.671
Hey, can you just, like,
not mention Princeton?

38:17.754 --> 38:20.173
Or just around Sean, please.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.343
Wait, I mean, you mean you haven't
already told him?

38:23.427 --> 38:24.636
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-I mean,

38:24.720 --> 38:26.096
he-he thinks you're
living together next year.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.764
Okay, okay, well, maybe
he shouldn't just assume that.

38:27.848 --> 38:31.852
Yeah, yeah, but it's rather uncouth
to just let him go and keep assuming.

38:33.979 --> 38:37.107
KUNLE (muffled):
No, you're right, you're right.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.192
(conversation continues indistinctly)

38:43.947 --> 38:45.949
(dog barking in distance)

38:50.829 --> 38:52.831
(TV plays indistinctly)

39:02.591 --> 39:05.510
-(Emma whoops, laughs)
-KUNLE: Whoo. Yeah, you did it. Whoo, yes.

39:05.594 --> 39:08.638
-(whooping)
-Whoa. Whoo.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.474
-KUNLE: Come on.
-Can y'all please hurry up?

39:10.557 --> 39:12.768
-This fucking lady watching us.
-CARLOS: What lady?

39:15.645 --> 39:17.397
KUNLE:
Hmm-mm.

39:17.481 --> 39:18.607
Get up.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.150
-I'm driving.
-What?

39:20.233 --> 39:22.861
You're paranoid... because you're high.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.988
Which is exactly why
you shouldn't be driving.

39:25.072 --> 39:27.949
Okay. Whatever. Okay.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.659
SEAN:
I ain't gonna worry about anything, am I?

39:29.743 --> 39:31.369
SEAN (deep voice):
Yeah.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.330
(door alarm dinging)

39:33.413 --> 39:34.581
(door closes)

39:34.664 --> 39:37.125
Hey, um, the taillight's busted.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.710
SEAN:
What?

39:40.295 --> 39:41.963
(long exhale)

39:42.047 --> 39:44.174
-SEAN: We gonna die.
-KUNLE: No, we are...

39:44.257 --> 39:45.509
-No. What?
-We gonna die, bro.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.094
-Hey. No, no, no, no.
-Oh, we gonna die tonight.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.637
Don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this right...

39:48.720 --> 39:49.763
We gonna die. We gonna die, Kunle.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.098
We get pulled over, we die, Kunle.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.058
-Look...
-We call the police, we die, Kunle.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.810
-Okay, look, Sean, Sean, Sean.
-We breathe the wrong way,

39:54.893 --> 39:56.144
-we die, Kunle.
-Okay, look, Sean.

39:56.228 --> 39:58.605
This isn't good,
but panicking does not help.

39:58.688 --> 40:01.358
Calm down. Look, hey, man,
look at me. Look at me.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.693
-Okay.
-Think about it statistically.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.821
How many people actually
get shot by the cops?

40:05.904 --> 40:08.657
It's, like, really,
really unlikely, right?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.575
-A lot, Kunle.
-No, no, no.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.577
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-No, no, no, no, no.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.204
No, it's really, really unlikely.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.456
I mean, do you know anyone
who's actually been shot by the police?

40:16.540 --> 40:18.542
-I don't know anybody. -CARLOS: No.
-SEAN: Yes.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.835
My cousin.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.628
Geez, man. I'm sorry.

40:21.711 --> 40:23.505
-Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't...
-Is he...?

40:23.588 --> 40:25.507
He wasn't doing anything--
just minding his business,

40:25.590 --> 40:27.509
hanging with a friend,
playing Call of Duty.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.428
And they just showed up
for-for... for no reason?

40:31.471 --> 40:33.306
Well, his friend was trapping
a little bit.

40:33.390 --> 40:35.016
-His friend was trapping a little bit.
-God.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.810
(stammers) The cops came in,

40:36.893 --> 40:38.562
kicked the gor... door down.

40:38.645 --> 40:42.357
I mean, they say he scared 'em,
and they shot him, all right?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.776
Shot him right in his ass, man.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.362
(chuckles)

40:47.445 --> 40:48.905
(Kunle and Carlos laughing)

40:51.783 --> 40:53.493
(laughter continues)

40:53.577 --> 40:55.954
SEAN: Oh, you motherfuckers
are some assholes.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.165
That's not funny.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.250
He got to wear a colostomy bag now.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.837
-Oh.
-You ever boo-boo in a bag?

41:03.920 --> 41:05.505
-(Kunle chuckles)
-No.

41:05.589 --> 41:07.215
He might've did some fucked-up shit,
but that don't mean

41:07.299 --> 41:08.633
that he deserved that.
Like, come on, y'all.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.093
-KUNLE: Okay, no, he didn't,
-Guys.

41:10.177 --> 41:12.137
-but what do you want to do?
-Guys.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.680
Incoming.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.682
MAN: Hey, we can see
what you're doing out here,

41:15.765 --> 41:17.309
and we don't tolerate that
in this neighborhood.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.560
We saw you.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.020
MAN:
You need to get out of here.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.813
WOMAN:
And you don't need to be selling drugs.

41:21.897 --> 41:23.982
-SEAN: We're leaving. -Get out.
-KUNLE: Look, look, look.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.525
-We're-we're not doing anything wrong.
-Please get your phone out of my face.

41:25.609 --> 41:27.319
-We just had some car issues.
-MAN: I said get out.

41:27.402 --> 41:28.820
WOMAN:
We already put your picture up

41:28.904 --> 41:30.155
-on the Good Neighbor app.
-(engine starting)

41:30.238 --> 41:32.365
-WOMAN: They're leaving.
-MAN: Yeah, let 'em go.

41:33.450 --> 41:36.119
-(woman scoffs)
-MAN: Come on.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.663
-WOMAN: I got… I got it all.
-MAN: Yeah.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.624
ALICE (voice-over):
Her pin's moving again.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.673
It looks like she's in that car.

41:51.718 --> 41:54.137
KUNLE: She seriously thought
we were drug dealers.

41:54.221 --> 41:56.056
What if she called the cops?

41:56.139 --> 41:58.266
What if we get pulled over?
What if we get pulled over?

41:58.350 --> 41:59.684
What if we get pulled over?

41:59.768 --> 42:01.937
Sean, what do we do?

42:02.020 --> 42:04.773
Look, Terence got an extra car
that we can use, okay?

42:04.856 --> 42:07.192
He live around the corner. It's not far.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.236
Are you sure there's just not just, like,

42:09.319 --> 42:10.904
one other, like... maybe your aunt.

42:10.987 --> 42:13.114
We can go to your aunt's house.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.200
Just make this left up here. Don't be...

42:15.283 --> 42:17.244
Don't be fucking nervous.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.957
He's the closest?

42:31.925 --> 42:33.551
(turns off engine)

42:33.635 --> 42:36.054
No, no, no. Hey, hey.
You stay here with her.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.555
-(door closes)
-Come on, Kunle.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.603
EMMA (groans):
It...

42:43.687 --> 42:46.690
It's all spinning.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.528
-(unscrews lid)
-Here. Here.

42:51.611 --> 42:54.197
Hydrate or die-drate.

42:54.281 --> 42:57.033
(gulping)

42:58.576 --> 43:00.245
(Carlos chuckles)

43:00.328 --> 43:02.080

52:25.309 --> 52:27.770
Why... why would she get in a random car

52:27.854 --> 52:30.064
with three fucking guys
that she doesn't even know?

52:30.147 --> 52:33.693
-She's 17. -Ma'am, I'm just trying
to understand your emergency.

52:33.776 --> 52:35.528
Oh, uh, actually,
it feels like you're trying to say

52:35.611 --> 52:37.655
that I'm racist or something,
and I'm really not,

52:37.738 --> 52:39.615
-so I don't really know
what you're trying to do. -Maddy...

52:39.699 --> 52:41.033
My sister needs help.

52:41.117 --> 52:42.535
Are you intoxicated, ma'am?

52:42.618 --> 52:44.704
How does that... How does...
Wait, how does that matter?

52:44.787 --> 52:46.205
-How does that even matter?
-Okay, Maddy, give me the...

52:46.289 --> 52:48.624
-I saw what I saw!
-Maddy. Hi. I'm so sorry.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.835
-My-my friend is just a little bit upset
-Give me the phone. Give me it. (grunts)

52:50.918 --> 52:52.920
-because it's her sister.
-DISPATCHER: Uh-huh.

52:53.004 --> 52:55.339
Is there any way we could do,
like, a welfare check?

52:55.423 --> 52:57.842
We're tracking her phone,
so we have her current location.

52:57.925 --> 53:00.553
DISPATCHER: Sure. We'll send our
next available officer to check it out.

53:00.636 --> 53:02.346

Can you guys ride any faster?

RAFAEL:
Just...

56:18.125 --> 56:19.710
RAFAEL: You sure you don't want me
to switch with you, Alice?

56:19.794 --> 56:21.712
This thing really isn't that hard to ride.

56:21.796 --> 56:23.255
-I think you'd probably get it.
-Why aren't they moving?

56:23.339 --> 56:24.757
-You sure?
-Yeah.

56:24.840 --> 56:27.259
Okay, actually, yeah,
that might be a really good idea.

56:27.343 --> 56:28.677
Guys, we can't stop.

56:28.761 --> 56:30.179
-Maddy, just one second.
-What are you doing?

56:30.262 --> 56:31.388
We can't stop.

56:34.475 --> 56:36.310

56:36.393 --> 56:38.395
You know, Alice has been
driving you around all night.

You could, I don't know,

-be grateful.
-Rafael, it's all right.

56:41.107 --> 56:42.733
-Excuse me?
-No, no, no. No, you're awesome.

56:42.817 --> 56:44.068
-First of all, no.
-And you're cool.

56:44.151 --> 56:45.694
-You don't even know me.
-And you deserve better than this.

56:45.778 --> 56:47.947
-Yeah, she's great. Are you for real?
-I'm just saying.

56:48.030 --> 56:49.323
You don't even fucking know me.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.783
You don't get to be all white knight

56:50.866 --> 56:52.451
-and be offended on her behalf.
-Oh, "white knight," yeah.

56:52.535 --> 56:54.829
I'm freaking out
because my sister has been taken

56:54.912 --> 56:57.331
and that 911 lady was a total bitch to me
on the phone.

56:57.414 --> 56:59.083
But you know, you know,
you could just not be actively mean.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.001
-I'm sorry! I'm having a hard night!
-We're here, all right?

57:01.085 --> 57:02.336
And we're here for you, Maddy.

57:02.419 --> 57:03.712
We're fucking here.

57:03.796 --> 57:05.756
You brought a high schooler
to a fraternity party

57:05.840 --> 57:07.174
and then neglected her for two hours.

57:07.258 --> 57:08.425
We're fucking here.

57:08.509 --> 57:10.177
So get on the goddamn bike,
and we're going.

I think you should get on the bike.

Trail ends here.

57:28.028 --> 57:31.157
All right, shit, it must mean
she around here somewhere.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.200
Uh, or...

57:33.284 --> 57:35.119
she backtracked.

57:35.202 --> 57:37.329
Or-or maybe--

57:37.413 --> 57:39.415
no offense-- you're in no way qualified

57:39.498 --> 57:40.875
to track people through the woods.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.334
-I'm an Eagle Scout.
-Okay.

57:42.418 --> 57:43.919
I was trained in tracking animals.

57:44.003 --> 57:45.713
Okay, but this isn't Boy Scouts,
all right?

57:45.796 --> 57:48.549
-It's not... -This isn't a video game.
This is real life.

57:48.632 --> 57:52.887
And we... we can't just reload
if you're wrong, Carlos.

57:52.970 --> 57:54.305
And I'm sorry, but I don't see anything.

57:54.388 --> 57:55.639
Do you see anything?

57:55.723 --> 57:57.892
Sean, you see anything?
Uh, no, there's nothing.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.351

-SEAN: Just breathe, my nigga. Damn.

58:01.478 --> 58:03.522
-CARLOS: Okay.
-What if she dies out here?

58:03.606 --> 58:05.649
Huh? Why did I listen to you?

58:05.733 --> 58:07.943
This is so fucking stupid.

58:08.027 --> 58:09.570
This is so stupid.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.614
I told you we should just call 911,

58:11.697 --> 58:12.865
but you wouldn't let me.

58:12.948 --> 58:14.491
You just wouldn't let me call.

58:14.575 --> 58:15.826
Now look at us.

58:15.910 --> 58:17.411
Wouldn't let you call?

58:17.494 --> 58:19.663
What the fuck am I,
your third-grade teacher?

58:19.747 --> 58:21.248
You decided not to call.

58:21.332 --> 58:23.500
We all decided to not call.

58:24.793 --> 58:27.213
He didn't force you not to call.

58:27.296 --> 58:28.380
Seriously?

58:28.464 --> 58:30.007
SEAN:
If you called, it would be on you,

58:30.090 --> 58:32.760
and you didn't want it to be on you
because you knew I was right.

58:32.843 --> 58:34.178
Also because you're a pussy.

58:34.261 --> 58:35.763
-What?
-KUNLE: I'm-I'm a pussy?

58:35.846 --> 58:38.015
-Yeah.
-I'm a pussy, but you've been afraid

58:38.098 --> 58:40.100
-of everything this whole night?
-CARLOS (clears throat): Guys, guys.

58:40.184 --> 58:41.894
-I'm a pussy?
-Can we not call each other pussies?

58:41.977 --> 58:43.646
It's kind of sexist.

58:43.729 --> 58:45.981
A vagina is strong enough
to give birth to a child.

58:46.065 --> 58:48.359
I mean, I think the word
that you're looking for

58:48.442 --> 58:50.903
is-is "coward" or-or, ironically enough,

58:50.986 --> 58:52.529
-"wiener."
-KUNLE: Yeah.

58:52.613 --> 58:56.116
Mm-hmm. Don't be such a sexist
coward wiener, Sean.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.868
SEAN:
I can't believe you just said that

58:57.952 --> 58:59.954
-out your mouth, first of all.
-Yeah. Sexist coward wiener.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.206
-You, all of that. -Okay, well,
don't be such a little bitch, Kunle.

59:02.289 --> 59:03.332
-I'm a bitch?
-Yeah.

59:03.415 --> 59:04.708
-That's also arguably sexist.
-Okay. -Yeah.

59:04.792 --> 59:05.793
Calm down.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.169
-If you got something to say, just say it.
-Look, okay.

59:07.253 --> 59:11.131
You were around real Black men
for like two fucking minutes tonight,

59:11.215 --> 59:12.591
and you went and hid in the bathroom.

59:12.675 --> 59:14.677
-Who was hiding? I was hiding?
-You! It's okay.

59:14.760 --> 59:16.595
-I wasn't hiding. I wasn't hiding.
-I love you still.

59:16.679 --> 59:18.222
-SEAN: Oh, wow.
-Okay, all right, no, we can do this.

59:18.305 --> 59:19.682
What the fuck do you want me to say?

59:19.765 --> 59:22.101
What, I'm so sorry
that my parents are doctors?

59:22.184 --> 59:24.270
Oh, shit, you know what?
I'm even more sorry

59:24.353 --> 59:26.272
-that my childhood was happy.
-(sneezes) Ow.

59:26.355 --> 59:27.898
You know what?

59:27.982 --> 59:31.026
You don't have the authority
to revoke my Blackness, dickhead.

59:31.110 --> 59:32.528
Guys, can we... can we please just...

59:32.611 --> 59:34.113
No, no, no. Let him continue.

59:34.196 --> 59:35.739
-Kunle angry.
-(laughs): You know what?

59:35.823 --> 59:39.660
I think it is hilarious
that you think that you are so wise.

59:39.743 --> 59:42.496
Like you got some kind of street smarts.
Why?

59:42.579 --> 59:44.915
Oh, why, Sean?
Because you know where to buy acid?

59:44.999 --> 59:46.834
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, Carlos.

59:46.917 --> 59:48.752
Guess what.
This dude's tried drugs before.

59:48.836 --> 59:50.504
-I know.
-KUNLE: Whoo, yeah!

59:50.587 --> 59:51.839
Round of applause, motherfucker.

59:51.922 --> 59:53.173
You tried drugs.

59:53.257 --> 59:54.341
But you know what?

59:54.425 --> 59:55.843
Who the fuck cares?

59:55.926 --> 59:57.678
You know what, Sean?

59:57.761 --> 59:59.930
The last time I checked,
getting fucked-up all the time

1:00:00.014 --> 1:00:01.932
doesn't mean you know a goddamn thing.

1:00:02.016 --> 1:00:03.642
It just makes you fucked-up.

1:00:07.146 --> 1:00:08.897
SEAN (sputters, laughing):
Okay.

1:00:12.651 --> 1:00:14.361
-I like this Kunle.
-Yeah, I'm glad you do.

1:00:14.486 --> 1:00:15.946
This Kunle is nice.

1:00:16.030 --> 1:00:17.823
-That's good. You showing nuts now.
-Fuck this.

1:00:17.906 --> 1:00:19.867
Look, I feel like it's the first time
he ever used

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:21.243
his Black skin tone type of thing.

1:00:21.327 --> 1:00:22.870
-This is great. I like this.
-KUNLE: You know what?

1:00:22.953 --> 1:00:24.330
SEAN:
Nah, I'm sorry, that was just really good.

1:00:24.413 --> 1:00:25.622
Look, just chill out, all right?
Chill out.

1:00:25.706 --> 1:00:26.957
-No, I'm gonna... I'm call...
-Give me the fucking phone.

1:00:27.041 --> 1:00:28.625
KUNLE:
Carlos, give me your phone.

1:00:28.709 --> 1:00:31.003
-Give me your phone.
-Just chill out, Carlos.

1:00:31.086 --> 1:00:32.880
-Give it to me now!
-Come on.

1:00:32.963 --> 1:00:34.590
-Don't give him your phone.
-Give it to me, Carlos.

1:00:34.673 --> 1:00:35.799
Don't... Calm down.

1:00:35.883 --> 1:00:37.259
We don't got time for this, Kunle.
Chill out.

1:00:37.343 --> 1:00:39.261
-No, we lost her!
-The girl, we... Ooh.

1:00:39.345 --> 1:00:42.431
We lost this girl in the fucking forest
because of you!

1:00:42.514 --> 1:00:43.515
You!

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:46.810
-Fuck!
-(quietly): Ouch. Nice.

1:00:46.894 --> 1:00:48.729
-Give me this fucking...
-Hey, hey. -Get your ass...

1:00:48.812 --> 1:00:50.230
-(groans)
-SEAN: See?

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.357
-KUNLE: Fuck! -SEAN: Kunle.
-Guys, guys.

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:52.733
-Can we please stop fighting?
-Asshole!

1:00:52.816 --> 1:00:55.027
It doesn't accomplish anything.

1:00:55.110 --> 1:00:57.071
-Come on.
-SEAN: All right, look.

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:59.031
Let's take it to a vote
since this dickhead right here

1:00:59.114 --> 1:01:01.617
-wants to go all at. Right?
-(sneezes) Ow.

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:05.579
All in favor of calling the police,
raise your hand.

1:01:07.331 --> 1:01:08.791
KUNLE:
Yeah, how you feel?

1:01:08.874 --> 1:01:10.584
I feel so good.

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:12.669
I feel really good, Kunle.

1:01:20.219 --> 1:01:22.888
Yeah, you're both cowards.

1:01:22.971 --> 1:01:25.516
SEAN (whispers):
We're both cowards.

1:01:25.599 --> 1:01:27.601
Get off of me, Carlos!

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:29.395
SEAN:
Don't be mad at him.

1:01:29.478 --> 1:01:32.022
(Emma coughing nearby)

1:01:32.106 --> 1:01:34.108
(coughing continues)

1:01:41.448 --> 1:01:42.866
Found her.

1:01:43.992 --> 1:01:46.078
How the fuck she get in a tree?

1:01:48.330 --> 1:01:52.251
CARLOS: Someday this will all just be
a crazy story, you know?

1:01:53.293 --> 1:01:56.296
Remember when we tried
to sneak into Underground?

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:58.132
Freshman year.

1:01:59.550 --> 1:02:00.843
(Carlos chuckles)

1:02:00.926 --> 1:02:02.344
SEAN:
Yeah, and you got stuck in the window

1:02:02.428 --> 1:02:04.138
-like fucking Winnie-the-Pooh.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1:02:04.221 --> 1:02:05.806
That's what you said back then.

1:02:05.889 --> 1:02:08.308
And-and, um,
then we went back to your room,

1:02:08.392 --> 1:02:13.564
and we just watched 1970s Winnie-the-Pooh
compilation videos on YouTube.

1:02:16.150 --> 1:02:20.154
You know, I-I feel like that's the night
that we became friends.

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:23.699
Like, this is kind of our friend-versary.

1:02:23.782 --> 1:02:25.701
We've come full circle.

1:02:25.784 --> 1:02:27.870
So, we all just get to go to Underground.

1:02:27.953 --> 1:02:29.371
Finally, right?

1:02:29.455 --> 1:02:30.998
And-and just in time.

1:02:31.081 --> 1:02:33.083
Because this is our last chance.

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:37.546
So you got to come, man.

1:02:37.629 --> 1:02:40.132
Don't be a party pooper. Come on.

1:02:40.215 --> 1:02:42.509
I'm tired.

1:02:42.593 --> 1:02:44.761
But, y-you know, you should go.

1:02:46.805 --> 1:02:49.558
SEAN:
Fuck him. L-Let him be a party pooper.

1:02:49.641 --> 1:02:51.685
CARLOS:
Come on, Kunle.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:53.645
KUNLE:
I can't go.

1:02:53.729 --> 1:02:55.105
If I go, you can't go.

1:02:55.189 --> 1:02:57.065
Because Sean only got two passes.

1:02:57.149 --> 1:03:00.486
Sean only got passes for himself plus one.

1:03:02.112 --> 1:03:03.780
So you should go.

1:03:05.157 --> 1:03:07.159
Bitch-ass shit.

1:03:08.243 --> 1:03:10.162
Los, I just didn't think you'd want to go.

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:11.580
That was it.

1:03:11.663 --> 1:03:13.624
No, I-I, um...

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:15.375
For real, I really did think
that you was just

1:03:15.459 --> 1:03:17.294
-gonna be playing games tonight, man.
-I was.

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:22.466
I was. Yes, so it's... it's fine.

1:03:23.509 --> 1:03:25.052
Los.

1:03:26.136 --> 1:03:27.971
-Los.
-CARLOS: That's...

1:03:28.055 --> 1:03:29.598
That's fine. Yeah.

1:03:29.681 --> 1:03:31.433
(chuckles)

1:03:31.517 --> 1:03:33.519
(crickets chirping)

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:42.653
Whoa, whoa, guys, look.

1:03:52.746 --> 1:03:53.956
ALICE:
Come on.

1:04:00.796 --> 1:04:02.339
ALICE (whispers):
Call 911 again.

1:04:02.422 --> 1:04:04.424
-RAFAEL: I think we should call 911.
-ALICE: Okay, I'll do it.

1:04:04.508 --> 1:04:07.386
DISPATCHER:
911. What is the nature of your emergency?

1:04:07.469 --> 1:04:09.471
-ALICE: Yes, hi. It's us again.
-Oh.

1:04:09.555 --> 1:04:11.306
We called about the girl in the van.

1:04:11.390 --> 1:04:14.351
Well, we're, like,
hiding and-and-and looking at them,

1:04:14.434 --> 1:04:16.353
and we're pretty sure
that something bad is going on now.

1:04:16.436 --> 1:04:18.772
They've brought her
into the middle of the woods.

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:21.066
She looks unconscious.

1:04:21.149 --> 1:04:23.694
(Sean and Kunle speaking indistinctly)

1:04:23.777 --> 1:04:24.945
SEAN:
What's wrong with you?

1:04:25.028 --> 1:04:26.029
KUNLE:
Okay, don't ask me what's wrong with me.

1:04:26.113 --> 1:04:27.155
What's wrong with you?

1:04:27.239 --> 1:04:28.991
-SEAN: I ain't fuck up nobody's moment.
-Okay, well, look, this whole...

-You found her?

1:08:19.930 --> 1:08:21.348

1:09:01.638 --> 1:09:03.139
Okay, well, if she's still breathing,

1:09:03.223 --> 1:09:05.475

that her heart is still beating.

-You're just trying to help?

1:09:07.394 --> 1:09:09.729

1:09:09.813 --> 1:09:11.857

at some weird house on the way here?

1:09:11.940 --> 1:09:13.775

getting pulled over.

1:09:13.859 --> 1:09:15.318

and-and-and...

1:09:56.902 --> 1:09:58.570

I almost lost my brother. (chuckles)

1:28:33.809 --> 1:28:36.103
Give a fuck about a tour.

1:28:36.186 --> 1:28:38.022
It was never about the parties, man.

1:28:38.105 --> 1:28:40.024
(whispers):
The fucking parties.

1:28:46.363 --> 1:28:49.742
(sniffs) When I found out
that you was going to Princeton,

1:28:49.825 --> 1:28:51.368
shit, I just got happy as shit.

1:28:51.452 --> 1:28:52.995
Wh-wh-what?

1:28:53.078 --> 1:28:54.788
Wait, you knew I was going to Princeton?

1:28:54.872 --> 1:28:56.248
(laughing):
Yeah.

1:28:56.331 --> 1:28:59.585
Man, I knew before you did.

1:28:59.668 --> 1:29:03.839
Saw that big-ass envelope in the mail.

1:29:03.922 --> 1:29:05.632
I don't know, man, I just...

1:29:05.716 --> 1:29:07.468
Look, everybody know
that you gonna be like

1:29:07.551 --> 1:29:12.848
the Barack Obama
of fungus and bacteria and such,

1:29:12.931 --> 1:29:15.434
win a Nobel Prize and shit, man.

1:29:15.517 --> 1:29:18.062
You gonna have your own Wikipedia page,
you fucking nerd.

1:29:18.145 --> 1:29:19.855
(both laugh)

1:29:21.148 --> 1:29:23.650
You gonna change the world, bro.

1:29:24.777 --> 1:29:28.363
Ten years from now, none of this shit
gonna mean nothing to you.

1:29:31.992 --> 1:29:33.202
(sniffles)

1:29:33.285 --> 1:29:35.120
It just scared me, bro.

1:29:35.204 --> 1:29:37.498
You wasn't gonna say nothing to me.

1:29:37.581 --> 1:29:40.501
Just gonna leave and...
(shuddering exhale)

1:29:41.543 --> 1:29:43.879
Just tried to do something, you know?

1:29:43.962 --> 1:29:46.882
The-the Legendary Tour
would've worked, you know?

1:29:46.965 --> 1:29:49.968
We could've been
on the Wall of Firsts, and...

1:29:50.052 --> 1:29:51.970
I don't know, man.

1:29:55.224 --> 1:29:59.394
Something to prove that, you know, uh,
I guess we both went here together.

1:30:00.646 --> 1:30:02.731
And we was friends, you know?

1:30:05.818 --> 1:30:08.195
Come on, Sean...

1:30:08.278 --> 1:30:12.616
we are still going to be friends
when we graduate.

1:30:12.699 --> 1:30:14.993
Yeah, yeah.

1:30:15.077 --> 1:30:16.745
Yeah.

1:30:17.788 --> 1:30:20.290
You're my best friend.

1:30:21.834 --> 1:30:23.669
You're my best friend, too.

1:30:29.383 --> 1:30:31.552
And I really was going to tell you
about Princeton.

1:30:31.635 --> 1:30:35.889
It's just, um... I was. I just...
I'm not even sure if I want to go.

1:30:35.973 --> 1:30:37.516
-All right. (chuckles)
-I'm serious. I'm not...

1:30:37.599 --> 1:30:39.351
Just because we're emotional
don't mean that we're stupid.

1:30:39.434 --> 1:30:40.936
I'm just not sure I...

1:30:41.019 --> 1:30:43.147
Look, it's Princeton.

1:30:43.230 --> 1:30:45.149
You got to fucking go to Princeton.

1:30:45.232 --> 1:30:47.860
You earned it, and you deserve it, Le.

1:30:49.736 --> 1:30:52.781
Plus, I don't even got a job.
I could move closer to you.

1:30:52.865 --> 1:30:54.616
Wait, where is... where is...

1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.035
Where is, uh, Princeton?

1:30:58.245 --> 1:30:59.997
It's in New Jersey.

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.166
-Oh, fuck. I-I...
-I know. I know.

1:31:02.249 --> 1:31:03.458
I know, it's New Jersey, but...

1:31:03.542 --> 1:31:04.918
-it's not that...
-Yeah, I-I should've thought first.

1:31:05.002 --> 1:31:07.713
It's... Yeah, it's still Jersey.

1:31:07.796 --> 1:31:09.381
But it's an hour away from Philly
and New York,

1:31:09.464 --> 1:31:10.799
-so that's at least...
-(water running)

1:31:10.883 --> 1:31:13.385
I would not drink that.

1:31:13.468 --> 1:31:14.970
It's just water, Kunle. I'm thirsty.

1:31:15.053 --> 1:31:16.847

your own Wikipedia page, too.

1:31:19.933 --> 1:31:21.602
-Mm.
-Yeah.

1:31:21.685 --> 1:31:23.395
But finishing your thesis, graduating...

1:31:23.478 --> 1:31:24.688
-Oh, shit.
-These are baby steps.

1:31:24.771 --> 1:31:26.398
Like, we don't have to have
it all planned out

1:31:26.481 --> 1:31:27.774
-if we can just take...
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:31:27.858 --> 1:31:31.403
-I can have... What?
-Hey, hey, hey, calm... calm.

-What? Oh, shit.

1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:51.173
-Group hug is coming!
-It's okay.

-Wait, wait.
