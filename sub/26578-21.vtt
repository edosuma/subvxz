WEBVTT

00:00.265 --> 00:04.078
Peg, it happened again. We got a winner.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.119
The post office forgot
to cancel another stamp?

00:06.120 --> 00:07.829
Eight cents more toward
our cemetery plot.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.923
Oh, take me there now.

00:09.948 --> 00:11.690
I'm gonna start the tea kettle
and steam it off.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.499
Oh, good, you're home.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.709
I thought you might be out of town

00:17.710 --> 00:19.829
because your lawn
looks so poorly maintained.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.289
Oh, Helen. Is this an intentional visit?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.169
'Cause I know it's not uncommon
for people your age

00:24.170 --> 00:25.789
to get lost wandering
around the neighborhood.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.879
Let me have one of my boys
guide you home, hmm?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.959
You know, as scary
as this part of town is,

00:29.960 --> 00:30.999
that won't be necessary.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.305
- Hi, Helen.
- Hello, Michael.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.659
<i>Neither of my parents
much liked Helen Portollo.</i>

00:35.684 --> 00:37.289
<i>She was my mom's best friend.</i>

00:37.290 --> 00:38.749
Have you seen the article

00:38.750 --> 00:41.119
about my husband in the Press-Tribune?

00:41.120 --> 00:43.169
I wonder if we could have your copy

00:43.170 --> 00:44.709
when you're done clipping coupons

00:44.710 --> 00:45.999
and swatting your bugs.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.121
- Oh, Steven looks so distinguished.
- Yeah.

00:48.146 --> 00:50.047
And they saved ink by not
having to print hair.

00:53.410 --> 00:54.699
Something funny on the news.

00:54.724 --> 00:56.273
He got an award at work...

00:56.274 --> 00:57.393
Salesman of the Month.

00:57.394 --> 00:58.813
They were gonna give it to him in June,

00:58.814 --> 01:01.273
but we held out for one
with thirty-one days.

01:01.274 --> 01:02.393
It's right here next to the article

01:02.394 --> 01:03.933
- about Pioneer Days festivities.
- Mm.

01:03.934 --> 01:05.272
Of course, Mike and I were invited

01:05.274 --> 01:06.523
to the banquet again this year.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.273
We're so looking forward to going.

01:08.274 --> 01:10.393
Ugh, that's this weekend?

01:10.394 --> 01:12.523
Last year, they served
chicken stuffed with crab.

01:12.524 --> 01:13.723
Oh, that's what that was.

01:13.724 --> 01:15.183
Thought the chicken had gone bad.

01:15.184 --> 01:16.603
Steven and I will be there as well,

01:16.604 --> 01:18.143
- at the Mayor's table.
- Hm.

01:18.144 --> 01:20.853
Come by and say hi, although
it might be roped off.

01:20.854 --> 01:22.063
I'll be sure to wave.

01:22.064 --> 01:23.563
Well, I won't blame you if you forget.

01:23.564 --> 01:25.523
I know how you get with an open bar.

01:25.524 --> 01:28.933
Well, anyway, so great
to see you, Helen.

01:28.934 --> 01:29.934
You too, Peggy.

01:29.935 --> 01:30.984
Thank you.

01:32.564 --> 01:33.603
Criminy.

01:33.604 --> 01:35.103
I mean, if Steven's such a bigwig,

01:35.104 --> 01:37.103
you'd think he could afford
to buy his own newspapers.

01:37.104 --> 01:39.103
- And a big wig.
- They give out meaningless prizes

01:39.104 --> 01:40.563
at my work all the time.

01:40.564 --> 01:42.393
I'm getting one on Wednesday.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.273
You're getting an award,
and you didn't say anything

01:44.274 --> 01:46.603
while Helen was here bumpin'
her gums about Steven?

01:46.604 --> 01:48.433
I don't get all giddy
over some dumb trophy.

01:48.434 --> 01:51.103
Not even a trophy... They gave
him a paper certificate.

01:51.104 --> 01:53.603
I mean, babies get those
just for being born.

01:53.604 --> 01:55.773
The only certificate a real man wants

01:55.774 --> 01:56.893
is a weekly paycheck.

01:56.894 --> 01:58.933
- Oh, Mike.
- Ah!

01:58.934 --> 02:01.933
The siren song of a free stamp.

02:03.274 --> 02:05.223
You could've bragged
to your friend Helen

02:05.224 --> 02:06.523
that I just earned my Scout badge

02:06.524 --> 02:08.773
for making fire without a match.

02:08.774 --> 02:10.483
They give badges now
for doing easy things

02:10.484 --> 02:12.483
- the hardest way possible?
- I also earned

02:12.484 --> 02:14.853
my climbing-up-a-ladder-
with-no-hands badge.

02:14.854 --> 02:16.643
Oh, well, now, that actually
sounds like a useful skill.

02:16.644 --> 02:17.933
Tell me all about it.

02:17.934 --> 02:20.103
Well, the angle of the ladder
is critical...

02:22.894 --> 02:24.313
You...

02:24.337 --> 02:26.266

02:27.814 --> 02:29.603
You going on rides at the fair tonight?

02:29.604 --> 02:31.313
I'll cut you a deal on the tickets.

02:31.314 --> 02:32.773
Where'd you get those?

02:32.774 --> 02:34.023
Carnival supply company.

02:34.024 --> 02:36.603
I can also fix you up
with a four-foot Tweety Bird

02:36.604 --> 02:38.103
and all the baggies
full of goldfish you want.

02:38.104 --> 02:39.723
Where's the fun in a carnival prize

02:39.724 --> 02:40.983
if you don't win it?

02:40.984 --> 02:43.103
I've been practicing
that milk-bottle toss all year.

02:43.104 --> 02:44.523
I'm gonna win a visor,
which is basically

02:44.524 --> 02:45.773
the coolest parts of a hat.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.183
You know what's fun for me?

02:47.184 --> 02:48.563
Not having fun.

02:48.564 --> 02:50.603
Self-denial... That is the real fun.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.143
- Plus it costs nothing.
- And it's not fun.

02:53.144 --> 02:55.103
I'm gonna do my magic act
at the carnival.

02:55.104 --> 02:57.433
Having seen your act,
your most impressive trick

02:57.434 --> 02:59.313
was getting hired.

02:59.314 --> 03:01.563
I haven't sealed the deal,
but I already rented a tuxedo

03:01.564 --> 03:03.563
- so I know it's gonna happen.
- A lot of guys go to prom

03:03.564 --> 03:05.023
with that same naive optimism.

03:05.024 --> 03:07.103
They do magic at the prom?

03:07.104 --> 03:08.643
Oh, I can't wait for high school.

03:08.644 --> 03:10.313
<i>Yeah, let's just jump ahead</i>

03:10.314 --> 03:12.393
<i>and say there was no magic
at any of my proms.</i>

03:12.394 --> 03:15.023
<i>Although one year my date did disappear.</i>

03:15.024 --> 03:17.523
If you want this gig,
you'll need a manager... me.

03:17.524 --> 03:19.183
Why should clean-shaven P.T. Barnum

03:19.184 --> 03:21.853
get all the credit when the
bearded lady has all the talent?

03:21.854 --> 03:23.603
You're kind of arguing
against the need for a manager,

03:23.604 --> 03:25.723
- but I'm in!
- I love Pioneer Days.

03:25.724 --> 03:27.483
I wish I was a pioneer.

03:27.484 --> 03:29.273
Oh, Pat. You would've died in childbirth

03:29.274 --> 03:30.893
and probably taken me with you.

03:30.894 --> 03:32.643
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- Me too.

03:32.644 --> 03:35.063
We could be in Heaven right now
instead of eating this garbage.

03:35.064 --> 03:36.684
And I can say that 'cause I made it.

03:37.854 --> 03:40.063
Ah, everything looks delicious, Peg.

03:40.064 --> 03:41.893
You see a spread like this,
you appreciate

03:41.894 --> 03:44.223
the sacrifices made
by our pioneer forefathers.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.983
And the sacrifices they forced
the Native Americans to make.

03:46.984 --> 03:48.223
Everyone had a role to play.

03:48.224 --> 03:49.853
Native peoples were living in this area

03:49.854 --> 03:52.313
for 5,000 years with
a peaceful, communal culture.

03:52.314 --> 03:53.773
Exactly, communism,

03:53.774 --> 03:55.273
and we brought them
the American way of life,

03:55.274 --> 03:56.523
plus the religious freedom

03:56.524 --> 03:58.393
to pursue any form of Christianity.

03:58.394 --> 04:00.353
They had their own spiritual practices.

04:00.354 --> 04:02.433
Yeah, well, whoever they were
praying to, it didn't work.

04:02.434 --> 04:04.483
Lawrence does make a good case.

04:04.484 --> 04:06.933
Maybe we should boycott
this pioneer banquet

04:06.934 --> 04:08.893
out of respect to the Native
Americans and their gibberish.

04:08.894 --> 04:10.273
Nice try.

04:10.274 --> 04:11.933
We're going, and we're gonna shine.

04:11.934 --> 04:14.143
I just found out that Helen and Steven

04:14.144 --> 04:15.563
are not only at the Mayor's table,

04:15.564 --> 04:17.392
they are seated right next
to the guest of honor,

04:17.394 --> 04:18.933
Dan Blocker from "Bonanza."

04:18.934 --> 04:20.642
Can you slip him
my head shot and résumé?

04:20.644 --> 04:22.603
I just need to add "bronco
busting" to my special skills.

04:22.604 --> 04:24.063
It's that newspaper article, Mike.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.933
If you were more willing
to toot your own horn,

04:25.934 --> 04:28.563
we'd be up there with Hoss
instead of Helen and Steven.

04:28.564 --> 04:31.523
I would very much enjoy picking
Hoss Cartwright's brain...

04:31.524 --> 04:33.893
discussing ranching conditions
on the Ponderosa.

04:33.894 --> 04:36.103
But spending an awkward meal
with some Hollywood dandy?

04:36.104 --> 04:37.773
No, thank you.

04:37.774 --> 04:40.103
The name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

04:40.104 --> 04:41.893
<i>Pioneer Days wasn't just</i>

04:41.894 --> 04:43.433
<i>an annual banquet my father dreaded.</i>

04:43.434 --> 04:45.983
<i>It was a week-long celebration
of the frontier settlers</i>

04:45.984 --> 04:47.393
<i>whose perseverance, sacrifice,</i>

04:47.394 --> 04:49.933
<i>and rumored cannibalism
founded our town.</i>

04:49.934 --> 04:51.983
Whoa, look at her!

04:51.984 --> 04:53.433
In a more civilized time,

04:53.434 --> 04:55.313
she would've been stoned
by the town elders.

04:58.434 --> 05:01.523
How does any of this gaudy
hoopla honor the pioneers?

05:01.524 --> 05:04.023
Are you kidding?
My friend Dino got arrested here

05:04.024 --> 05:06.184
last night by a real-live
deputy sheriff.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.313
In memory of the pioneers,
I'm gonna win a hat

05:10.314 --> 05:11.603
that keeps the sun out of my eyes

05:11.604 --> 05:13.063
and still lets me tan my scalp.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.273
A quarter gets you one toss.
Three tosses for a dollar.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.273
- That's a deal!
- No, it's not.

05:17.274 --> 05:18.773
It's actually a rip-off!

05:18.774 --> 05:20.183
I'm only gonna need one.

05:20.184 --> 05:21.644
Thank you.

05:23.564 --> 05:25.313
Let's go.

05:25.314 --> 05:27.225
This whole event is
a festival of duplicity.

05:27.249 --> 05:30.538
I know. Give me the three-ball
deal my brother talked me out of.

05:32.724 --> 05:35.103
- Can I throw two balls at once?
- Suit yourself.

05:35.104 --> 05:36.603
Fifty cents, four-bits,

05:36.604 --> 05:39.063
- Ah! So much harder.
- ...one shiny half-dollar...

05:39.064 --> 05:41.103
...to see freaks and psychos

05:41.104 --> 05:42.603
and a collection of things in jars

05:42.604 --> 05:44.393
that you'll wish were in cans!

05:44.394 --> 05:45.933
And, for an extra quarter,

05:45.934 --> 05:49.273
you can feed shrimp
to anything with a mouth!

05:49.274 --> 05:50.773
Excuse me, sir.

05:50.774 --> 05:52.433
We have an act here
you may be interested in.

05:52.434 --> 05:54.563
Two arms, two legs, and a head.

05:54.564 --> 05:56.103
Unless he's hiding a tail under there,

05:56.104 --> 05:57.313
nobody's paying to see that.

05:57.314 --> 06:00.523
They might pay to see... this!

06:00.524 --> 06:02.353
And it's not even that cold.

06:02.354 --> 06:04.103
He's got a solid
five minutes of material

06:04.104 --> 06:05.893
he can easily stretch into an hour.

06:05.894 --> 06:08.433
Kids, these days,
I can't swing a dead dwarf

06:08.434 --> 06:10.023
without hitting a magician.

06:10.024 --> 06:11.933
In fact, I'm not even allowed
to swing a dead dwarf anymore.

06:11.934 --> 06:13.223
Thanks, Nixon.

06:13.224 --> 06:15.273
Offer the man a bite of your drumstick.

06:15.274 --> 06:16.393
Sorry, kid.

06:16.394 --> 06:17.773
I only showcase

06:17.774 --> 06:21.393
the kind of human monsters
that give people nightmares.

06:21.394 --> 06:23.603
Like that bendy little freak.

06:23.604 --> 06:25.273
Well, you're in luck.

06:25.274 --> 06:26.893
I also represent him.

06:26.894 --> 06:28.103
Ooh.

06:28.104 --> 06:29.603
What about me?

06:29.604 --> 06:31.933
I feel like I've taken you
as far as I can.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.984
Let's go to my tent
and talk some business.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.313
<i>Unlike Helen's husband,
my dad tried to keep</i>

06:37.314 --> 06:38.893
<i>a low profile at his work.</i>

06:38.894 --> 06:40.983
<i>He didn't go in
for a lot of showing off...</i>

06:40.984 --> 06:42.106
<i>...which Dad saw</i>

06:42.130 --> 06:43.284
<i>as a good way to lose a limb</i>

06:43.309 --> 06:45.773
<i>or, worse, the respect of his coworkers.</i>

06:45.774 --> 06:47.483
Honey, I specifically asked for

06:47.484 --> 06:48.523
a banana in my lunch today,

06:48.524 --> 06:50.063
and I can't find it anywhere!

06:51.434 --> 06:53.683
Good afternoon, feel free
to keep eating your lunches.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.143
I already had mine...

06:55.144 --> 06:57.273
- fish.
- Mm.

06:57.274 --> 06:59.773
Now, to this month's productivity award.

06:59.774 --> 07:01.274
Uh, I'll call you back.

07:04.354 --> 07:05.813
Well, it seems we have
a delightful surprise

07:05.814 --> 07:07.983
which, unfortunately, cannot be avoided.

07:07.984 --> 07:09.273
We have guests for today's award.

07:09.274 --> 07:10.643
Mike Cleary,

07:10.644 --> 07:12.023
apparently you have a family,

07:12.024 --> 07:13.273
and they are here.

07:13.274 --> 07:14.643
Surprise!

07:17.274 --> 07:19.433
- What is this?
- Well, I rallied all the boys

07:19.434 --> 07:21.023
to show how proud they are of their dad.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.433
Since when do I care what they think?

07:22.434 --> 07:24.483
Congratulations, Dad.

07:29.604 --> 07:31.314
I'll need those back.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.279
Honey, I told you,
this award was nothing.

07:36.304 --> 07:38.523
Well, I think that's
for the newspaper to decide.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.273
Right? Yeah, we're gonna
do a quick photo.

07:40.274 --> 07:41.483
Come on. Let's all line up.

07:41.484 --> 07:42.933
Just let me get his name on the plaque

07:42.934 --> 07:44.564
and peel off last month's winner.

07:45.604 --> 07:46.933
How long is this going to take?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.773
My client's due back at the side show.

07:48.774 --> 07:50.933
- I'm a curiosity.
- Oh.

07:50.934 --> 07:52.643
This is just you showboating for Helen

07:52.644 --> 07:55.103
- and her stupid, bald husband.
- Oh, poppycock.

07:55.104 --> 07:56.353
Make sure you get the whole family

07:56.354 --> 07:58.183
and all of Mike's hair in the shot.

08:01.016 --> 08:02.433
Stand up straight.

08:03.435 --> 08:04.683
Stand up straight.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.273
I don't want to accidentally
sew your hump into my dress.

08:07.274 --> 08:09.433
I am happy to contribute
in any small way

08:09.434 --> 08:11.313
to you dazzling at that banquet.

08:11.314 --> 08:12.393
Peg?

08:12.394 --> 08:13.433
- In here!
- In here!

08:14.484 --> 08:16.773
That stunt today was embarrassing.

08:16.774 --> 08:20.023
A man simply doing his job
does not belong in the newspaper

08:20.024 --> 08:21.853
unless that job is president

08:21.854 --> 08:23.393
or the Boston Strangler.

08:23.394 --> 08:24.893
Quiet dignity.

08:24.894 --> 08:26.223
That's what makes the man.

08:26.224 --> 08:27.483
Ouch!

08:27.484 --> 08:28.813
You accidentally stabbed me.

08:28.814 --> 08:30.483
Yeah, accidentally.

08:30.484 --> 08:32.393
Look, Mike, what's done is done.

08:32.394 --> 08:33.394
But according to William,

08:33.395 --> 08:35.063
your picture's on the front page.

08:35.063 --> 08:36.602
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

08:36.604 --> 08:38.602
Take off my dress before you ruin it.

08:38.604 --> 08:41.433
Why are we competing
with Helen and Steven?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.773
I have no interest in trying
to be some fancy big shot

08:43.774 --> 08:46.103
hobnobbing with glitterati like Hoss.

08:46.104 --> 08:48.433
I'm not gonna apologize
for being proud of my husband

08:48.434 --> 08:50.603
or the hard work he does
being better than Steven.

08:52.774 --> 08:54.773
The dogs are fiery out there today.

08:54.774 --> 08:55.684
Let's see the damage.

08:57.564 --> 09:00.334
Heavens to Murgatroyd.

09:00.358 --> 09:01.523
_

09:01.524 --> 09:04.313
This is a hair better
than Steven's picture.

09:04.314 --> 09:05.723
Let me just say
what everyone's thinking...

09:05.724 --> 09:08.564
I look great in evening-wear.

09:09.434 --> 09:13.103
From the mysterious depths
of the Marianas Trench

09:13.104 --> 09:16.273
and brought here in chains
at no small expense,

09:16.274 --> 09:18.063
I offer you...

09:18.064 --> 09:20.933
The Crab Boy!

09:20.934 --> 09:23.643
I pinch people and I'm crabby!

09:25.604 --> 09:27.353
I hear fancy seafood restaurants

09:27.354 --> 09:29.103
have offered millions for him.

09:29.104 --> 09:31.063
Does it bother anybody else

09:31.064 --> 09:33.273
that Crab Boy is wearing
a lobster costume?

09:33.274 --> 09:36.313
Oh. The lobster's the king of the crabs.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.813
The king crab is the king of the crabs.

09:37.814 --> 09:39.603
Well, keep it to yourself,
Jerk Cousteau.

09:39.604 --> 09:42.063
- Fear me!
- Watch out!

09:42.064 --> 09:45.223
Those snapping claws are razor sharp!

09:45.224 --> 09:49.273
Back! Back into your tank, Crab Boy!

09:49.274 --> 09:51.983
Just a taste of the gruesome wonders

09:51.984 --> 09:54.313
awaiting you inside the tent.

09:54.314 --> 09:55.603
I'll admit it.

09:55.604 --> 09:57.103
You've sucked me in.

09:57.104 --> 09:59.773
I'd like to feed him
some shrimp, please.

09:59.774 --> 10:02.023
This undermines the dignity
of the role I play

10:02.024 --> 10:03.773
contributing to our nation's defenses.

10:03.774 --> 10:06.603
The only indignity here is them
giving you all the credit...

10:06.604 --> 10:09.223
as if these kids fed off of
your insides for nine months.

10:09.224 --> 10:10.483
Ten and a half in Frank's case.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.813
The guys at work are gonna
have all kinds of smarmy fun.

10:12.814 --> 10:15.433
"Eight kids. Mr. Productivity."

10:15.434 --> 10:18.723
And I sure don't see us going
to that Pioneer dinner now...

10:18.724 --> 10:20.273
everyone staring at me

10:20.274 --> 10:22.433
like I'm one of those freaks
in a carnival sideshow.

10:22.434 --> 10:25.143
By the way, I hear they have
an excellent Crab Boy.

10:25.144 --> 10:26.983
Michael Cleary, I will not
let you use this

10:26.984 --> 10:28.773
as an excuse to not go to that banquet,

10:28.774 --> 10:31.433
like two years ago, when you
suddenly came down with polio.

10:31.434 --> 10:34.143
My foot fell asleep.
It was an honest mistake.

10:34.144 --> 10:36.103
So you're getting
a little unwanted attention...

10:36.104 --> 10:38.023
boo-hoo... it'll pass.

10:38.024 --> 10:40.393
This article might actually
do you some good at work.

10:40.394 --> 10:41.893
Squeaky wheel gets the grease.

10:41.894 --> 10:43.813
No, the squeaky wheel gets replaced!

10:43.814 --> 10:45.643
That's just basic wheel maintenance.

10:45.644 --> 10:48.644
Dad! Dad, get in here! Now!

10:49.854 --> 10:52.023
If he asks me to pick a card,
honest to God,

10:52.024 --> 10:53.933
I'm going to prison tonight.

10:53.934 --> 10:55.603
<i>...through the newspapers and, well,</i>

10:55.604 --> 10:57.063
<i>it's an article about a local man</i>

10:57.064 --> 10:58.433
<i>who works at Logan Aerospace</i>

10:58.434 --> 11:00.723
<i>right here in beautiful
downtown Burbank.</i>

11:00.724 --> 11:02.563
Holy moly.

11:02.564 --> 11:05.643
I know! It's my first
appearance on "Carson"!

11:05.644 --> 11:07.210
I just wish the other guests
were stronger.

11:07.235 --> 11:09.563
<i>Here he is, Mr. Mike Cleary,
with his eight children,</i>

11:09.564 --> 11:11.603
<i>who was named "Mr. Productivity."</i>

11:11.604 --> 11:13.483
<i>I should say so.</i>

11:13.484 --> 11:15.070
<i>And it says he's a machinist.</i>

11:15.095 --> 11:18.384
<i>One could say he's also a machine.</i>

11:18.814 --> 11:20.223
Oh.

11:20.224 --> 11:22.023
"It'll pass," Peg?

11:22.024 --> 11:24.023
- I'm a laughingstock!
- Oh, come on.

11:24.024 --> 11:25.813
<i>I hear his wife also won a prize...</i>

11:25.814 --> 11:27.643
<i>"Mrs. Re-Productivity."</i>

11:27.644 --> 11:29.523
Thank you, Johnny.

11:29.524 --> 11:31.523
Finally, Mom gets a crumb.

11:35.276 --> 11:39.455
<i>Mike Cleary, please
report to Mr. Crane's office.</i>

11:40.604 --> 11:42.141
You'll be alright, Cleary.
Just don't get

11:42.166 --> 11:44.103
Mr. Crane pregnant.

11:51.064 --> 11:52.523
Mr. Crane, I want to apologize

11:52.524 --> 11:54.273
for the embarrassment
I've caused the company.

11:54.274 --> 11:55.983
Believe me, having eight children

11:55.984 --> 11:58.223
was entirely unintentional.

11:58.224 --> 12:00.723
No need, Cleary.
I didn't see the Carson program,

12:00.724 --> 12:03.523
but people who enjoy humor
told me it was humorous.

12:03.524 --> 12:04.834
You're not angry?

12:04.859 --> 12:06.813
On the contrary, we're always
looking to put a human face

12:06.814 --> 12:09.313
on what we do here to balance
out the menacing shark faces

12:09.314 --> 12:11.893
we sometimes put on the missiles.

12:11.894 --> 12:13.393
I should apologize to you.

12:13.394 --> 12:15.433
After all these years, I didn't
even know you had children.

12:15.434 --> 12:16.773
In fairness, when I'm here,

12:16.774 --> 12:18.654
I'm trying my best to forget them.

12:18.679 --> 12:20.893
Considering the comedically
large size of your family,

12:20.894 --> 12:23.223
I've decided to give you
a raise, effective immediately.

12:23.224 --> 12:24.933
I thought there was a wage freeze.

12:24.934 --> 12:26.643
That's just something companies say.

12:26.644 --> 12:28.723
I'll eliminate the raises
for the unmarried guys

12:28.724 --> 12:30.393
and for men with three to four kids.

12:30.394 --> 12:33.587
Mr. Crane, I can't thank you enough.

12:33.672 --> 12:36.421
The amount you just did
was entirely adequate.

12:36.524 --> 12:37.983
Ta-da!

12:37.984 --> 12:39.523
What's with the lavish breakfast spread?

12:39.524 --> 12:40.773
The refrigerator broken again?

12:40.774 --> 12:42.773
Please don't make me eat
another tub of margarine.

12:42.774 --> 12:44.023
We're celebrating.

12:44.024 --> 12:47.273
Sausage, bacon, ham.
That's a party in my book.

12:47.274 --> 12:50.063
- For everyone except the pig.
- How about these cute, little eggs

12:50.064 --> 12:51.603
Pat brought home from the park?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.933
I found a nest.

12:52.934 --> 12:54.353
Congratulations on your raise, Dad.

12:54.354 --> 12:56.063
Well, credit where credit's due.

12:56.064 --> 12:57.064
It's thanks to your mother.

12:57.065 --> 12:58.103
Your father's being too humble.

12:58.104 --> 12:59.353
Although in this case, he's right.

12:59.354 --> 13:01.933
You boys need to learn
there is no sin in pride.

13:01.934 --> 13:03.683
Actually, it's one of
the Seven Deadly ones,

13:03.684 --> 13:05.433
right there between sloth and gluttony.

13:05.434 --> 13:06.483
Fine, it's a sin.

13:06.484 --> 13:07.773
But it's a necessary one

13:07.774 --> 13:09.273
if you want to go places in life.

13:09.274 --> 13:11.523
Do not be shy
about tooting your own horn.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.433
Okay. Well, I just taught myself

13:13.434 --> 13:15.984
- a very difficult magic trick...
- Mom talking.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.273
Anyway, I'm done.

13:18.274 --> 13:20.143
Well, however my horn got tooted,

13:20.144 --> 13:21.859
you kids showing up paid off.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.773
Mr. Crane saw this brood
and gave me a raise.

13:24.774 --> 13:26.773
So, at your job, people get paid more

13:26.774 --> 13:28.103
if they have more children?

13:28.104 --> 13:30.603
Well, a breadwinner
with responsibilities

13:30.604 --> 13:33.143
naturally gets a bit more than
some footloose single guy.

13:33.144 --> 13:34.893
Yeah, or some gal
just working for pin money

13:34.894 --> 13:36.603
till she lands a husband.

13:36.604 --> 13:37.933
I'm gonna have a hundred kids

13:37.934 --> 13:39.433
so I can be a millionaire!

13:39.434 --> 13:41.313
Making babies instead of working hard?

13:41.314 --> 13:43.813
- I could get into that.
- Nobody said I don't work hard.

13:43.814 --> 13:46.023
You said it yourself.
We got you this raise.

13:46.024 --> 13:47.353
Now, back to this trick I learned...

13:47.354 --> 13:49.853
Nobody got me anything
that I didn't 100% deserve.

13:49.854 --> 13:52.183
- Well, in my opinion...
- Oh, here we go.

13:52.184 --> 13:53.983
...you absolutely deserve the raise.

13:53.984 --> 13:55.563
Oh.

13:55.564 --> 13:56.773
Thank you, son.

13:56.774 --> 13:58.813
Don't fall for it, Mike.
He's gonna keep talking.

13:58.814 --> 14:02.063
The fact that Dad has so many
kids should be a factor.

14:02.064 --> 14:05.143
His boss obviously believes
in needs-based compensation.

14:05.144 --> 14:07.393
That's it exactly.
Listen to your brother.

14:07.394 --> 14:09.273
"From each according to his ability,

14:09.274 --> 14:11.063
to each according to his needs."

14:11.064 --> 14:12.643
- Well said.
- Well, I can't take credit.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.723
That's Karl Marx.

14:13.724 --> 14:15.063
Wait. What?

14:15.064 --> 14:16.183
I tried to warn you, Mike.

14:16.184 --> 14:18.273
So you're saying somehow
my raise is Marxism?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.393
It's a good thing. It's compassion.

14:20.394 --> 14:23.103
Crane isn't just treating you
like a cog in a machine.

14:23.104 --> 14:24.523
He doesn't want your family to suffer.

14:24.524 --> 14:26.103
Compassion?

14:26.104 --> 14:28.683
I don't need Crane sticking
his compassion in my business.

14:28.684 --> 14:31.933
This family will suffer
exactly as much as I want us to.

14:31.934 --> 14:34.433
- And more if the Church requires it.
- Congratulations, Lawrence.

14:34.434 --> 14:36.223
You've taken something
beautiful and American

14:36.224 --> 14:37.683
like more money and ruined it

14:37.684 --> 14:39.683
with compassion and Karl Marx!

14:39.684 --> 14:41.983
The celebration's over.

14:45.524 --> 14:47.063
You're not really upset, right?

14:47.064 --> 14:48.683
This was just a scam
to make off with the meat.

14:48.684 --> 14:50.983
I knew there was something
about that raise I didn't like.

14:50.984 --> 14:52.523
It's forty-six more dollars a week.

14:52.524 --> 14:53.723
The only thing not to like is that

14:53.724 --> 14:55.223
they didn't round up to fifty.

14:55.224 --> 14:57.023
You heard Lawrence.
It's a socialist hand-out.

14:57.024 --> 14:59.683
Like I'm in Red Square standing
in line for toilet paper.

14:59.684 --> 15:01.433
But you earned this toilet paper

15:01.434 --> 15:02.603
with your service to the company,

15:02.604 --> 15:04.223
from which you have no problem
bringing home

15:04.224 --> 15:06.103
- toilet paper all the time.
- Oh, it's not a hand-out

15:06.104 --> 15:07.433
when they don't know you're taking it.

15:07.434 --> 15:09.683
I'm a self-made man, Peg.

15:09.684 --> 15:12.433
I like to think that the things
we have in our life, we deserve.

15:12.434 --> 15:14.273
You really think we deserve this?

15:14.274 --> 15:16.143
If our life were merit-based,
I'd like to believe

15:16.144 --> 15:18.393
we'd be doing a little better
than stealing toilet paper

15:18.394 --> 15:19.773
and eating park eggs!

15:19.774 --> 15:22.433
- I can't accept the raise, honey.
- I can!

15:22.434 --> 15:24.563
It's for the kids, anyway,
and that's my area.

15:24.564 --> 15:26.983
So while you're off at work
being all "self-made,"

15:26.984 --> 15:29.273
I am cooking and cleaning
and in the backyard

15:29.274 --> 15:31.143
yanking a lizard
out of Baby Andy's mouth.

15:31.144 --> 15:33.313
- He's got a new tooth.
- Is he okay?

15:33.314 --> 15:34.893
Like you care about some lizard.

15:34.894 --> 15:38.313
Look, that 46 bucks will make
things better in my life.

15:38.314 --> 15:41.223
So call it communism
or Marxism or botulism,

15:41.224 --> 15:43.103
I don't want to hear any more
about your pride.

15:43.104 --> 15:44.773
It's a sin. Did you know that?

15:44.774 --> 15:46.433
They just added it to the list.

15:46.434 --> 15:49.641
If I compromise my principles,
I'm not the man you married.

15:55.144 --> 15:58.773
Pretty sure I'd be just as happy
with the higher-paid guy.

16:03.274 --> 16:04.723
Mr. Crane's office.

16:04.724 --> 16:06.072
Is Mr. Crane there?

16:06.097 --> 16:07.483
<i>Not yet. May I help you?</i>

16:07.484 --> 16:09.603
Uh, yeah. My husband works
in his department,

16:09.604 --> 16:12.723
and he thinks Mr. Crane
gave him a Marxist raise.

16:12.724 --> 16:15.023
A Marxist raise? Mr. Crane?

16:15.024 --> 16:16.523
Marxist, communist... I don't know.

16:16.524 --> 16:17.773
<i>My husband thinks he's in Red Square</i>

16:17.774 --> 16:20.740
- <i>waiting for Charmin.</i>
- And who's this Charmin?

16:20.765 --> 16:21.904
Focus, please.

16:21.943 --> 16:24.223
Look, Mr. Crane has
to convince my husband

16:24.224 --> 16:25.643
his raise is on the up-and-up,

16:25.644 --> 16:27.893
even if the orders come straight
from the Kremlin himself.

16:27.894 --> 16:29.273
<i>Do you understand?</i>

16:29.274 --> 16:31.433
I think I do.

16:31.434 --> 16:34.063
Yes. Thank you for this information.

16:34.064 --> 16:35.683
God bless America.

16:35.684 --> 16:36.723
Whatever.

16:37.774 --> 16:39.933
An apple? How'd this get in here?

16:39.934 --> 16:42.023
Is the school nurse coming
to do a home check again?

16:42.024 --> 16:44.023
That's from the carnival.
You can have it.

16:44.024 --> 16:45.933
Huh.

16:45.934 --> 16:47.723
That was very nice of you.

16:47.724 --> 16:50.523
I already licked off
all the caramel anyway.

16:53.644 --> 16:55.933
You finally won your stupid visor?

16:55.934 --> 16:57.893
I love it. It's like having an extra arm

16:57.894 --> 16:59.183
to do this all the time.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.273
And how many dollars
did you recklessly squander

17:01.274 --> 17:02.813
winning a 50-cent visor?

17:02.814 --> 17:04.143
It's not about the money, Frank.

17:04.144 --> 17:05.683
I had a blast winning it.

17:05.684 --> 17:07.603
Ah, the song of the gullible.

17:07.604 --> 17:09.143
You're exactly the type
of turnip-truck rube

17:09.144 --> 17:11.272
that keeps those carnies
living like kings.

17:11.273 --> 17:13.433
Like kings?
The guy in the goldfish booth

17:13.434 --> 17:16.063
told me he gets to eat
the ones that die.

17:16.064 --> 17:17.683
And I'm not sure he waits all the way.

17:18.853 --> 17:20.893
Pat? What are you doing here?

17:20.894 --> 17:23.143
Crab Boy's supposed to be onstage in...

17:23.144 --> 17:24.393
two minutes ago!

17:24.394 --> 17:25.772
Oh, I'm done with that.

17:25.773 --> 17:27.772
Oh, let me guess. You want to direct.

17:27.773 --> 17:29.143
You can't bail on me now, kid.

17:29.144 --> 17:31.143
Tonight's the Sea Freak Extravaganza.

17:31.144 --> 17:33.023
You're doing "Who's On First?"
with Squid Boy.

17:33.024 --> 17:34.933
- No, thank you.
- Don't push him, Joey.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.813
It's wrong to force a child

17:36.814 --> 17:39.433
into the cutthroat world
of entertainment...

17:39.434 --> 17:42.433
a dog-eat-dog hellscape
which chews you up

17:42.434 --> 17:44.393
and spits you out.

17:44.394 --> 17:45.933
Unless your talent is...

17:45.934 --> 17:47.603
♪ Undeniable ♪

17:55.354 --> 17:57.103
You really feel that way, kid?

17:57.104 --> 17:59.353
You're putting me
in sort of a tough spot.

17:59.354 --> 18:00.773
I signed a contract.

18:00.774 --> 18:02.523
What if I got you more snacks, huh?

18:02.524 --> 18:04.983
- Snacks for my star?
- It's not the snacks.

18:04.984 --> 18:08.603
I've had some of the best shrimp
of my life this week.

18:08.604 --> 18:09.933
I'm just done.

18:09.934 --> 18:12.603
Don't say that. You're my Crab Boy.

18:12.604 --> 18:14.223
I am not a crab!

18:14.224 --> 18:15.853
I am a human being

18:15.854 --> 18:17.774
with crab-like qualities!

18:18.564 --> 18:20.483
You don't know these carnie-folk.

18:20.484 --> 18:22.273
If I don't find someone to replace you,

18:22.274 --> 18:24.484
I'll end up in one of those jars.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.631
Hello? Mr. Crane?

18:27.656 --> 18:29.183
Could you come in here, please?

18:31.854 --> 18:35.103
Mr. Crane is currently
under investigation.

18:35.104 --> 18:37.603
The dark shadow of Soviet aggression

18:37.604 --> 18:40.603
has crept its way into Logan Aerospace.

18:40.604 --> 18:42.314
These Tootsie Rolls for anybody?

18:43.564 --> 18:45.933
- Hi there, Cleary.
- That would be Cleary

18:45.934 --> 18:47.933
as in "Michael Cleary"?

18:47.934 --> 18:49.273
Our security chief here

18:49.274 --> 18:50.643
got a phone tip that I was a communist.

18:50.644 --> 18:51.853
Which, if I was, I think I'd know.

18:51.854 --> 18:54.103
On the other hand, they are sneaky.

18:54.104 --> 18:55.813
How are you mixed up in all this,

18:55.814 --> 18:58.603
and do you know somebody named...

18:58.604 --> 18:59.853
Charmin?

18:59.854 --> 19:02.773
Listen, it's true that
Mr. Crane gave me a raise

19:02.774 --> 19:04.933
for reasons which possibly
fly in the face

19:04.934 --> 19:06.313
of free-market values.

19:06.314 --> 19:08.023
But I wouldn't call him a communist.

19:08.024 --> 19:09.563
He drives a brand-new Eldorado.

19:09.564 --> 19:10.933
But if I was a communist,

19:10.934 --> 19:12.933
isn't that exactly what I would do?

19:12.934 --> 19:15.313
Goodness. It's all adding up.

19:15.314 --> 19:18.433
I'm humorless, I thrive in
an anonymous bureaucracy,

19:18.434 --> 19:19.933
and I once wrote an effusive fan letter

19:19.934 --> 19:22.183
to Olympic gymnast Olga Korbut...

19:22.184 --> 19:23.783
"The Sparrow from Minsk."

19:23.808 --> 19:27.103
Look, I'm not sure what's
going on with Mr. Crane...

19:27.104 --> 19:29.103
Oh, have no doubt.
I'm in big trouble here.

19:29.104 --> 19:30.603
You really should distance yourself.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.223
I'm a patriotic American.

19:32.224 --> 19:34.983
I eat meat at every meal
and often as a snack.

19:34.984 --> 19:38.223
So if I've been offered a salary raise

19:38.224 --> 19:40.223
under orders from Leonid Brezhnev,

19:40.224 --> 19:42.523
I cannot, in good conscience,
accept that money.

19:42.524 --> 19:44.273
According to what I see here,

19:44.274 --> 19:46.603
your raise was entirely merit-based,

19:46.604 --> 19:49.643
and, frankly, you should've
gotten it two years ago.

19:49.644 --> 19:51.393
Seriously, Crane? Two years?

19:51.394 --> 19:52.643
There was a wage freeze.

19:52.644 --> 19:54.353
You said that was just
something companies say.

19:54.354 --> 19:55.773
Well, I obviously can't be trusted.

19:55.774 --> 19:58.023
Look at this jam I'm in right now.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.683
I'm never gonna see my kids again, am I?

20:01.604 --> 20:04.223
Turns out they've been
stiffing me for two years, Peg.

20:04.224 --> 20:05.773
Maybe more.

20:05.774 --> 20:07.483
Then we've got cause to celebrate.

20:07.484 --> 20:09.313
Forty-six bucks.

20:09.314 --> 20:10.603
We should get to the banquet early

20:10.604 --> 20:12.603
and tip the valet to ding Helen's car.

20:12.604 --> 20:13.933
Well, what's the point of being rich

20:13.934 --> 20:16.314
if we don't do good things
with our money?

20:19.041 --> 20:21.433
You're still doing this?
You already won your dumb hat.

20:21.434 --> 20:22.563
Yeah, but it's fun, man.

20:22.564 --> 20:24.273
Plus, with the visor,
I'm so much better at it.

20:24.274 --> 20:27.005
Turns out the sun was in my
eyes for the first forty bucks.

20:29.024 --> 20:30.183
Sammy, my friend,

20:30.184 --> 20:32.104
another visor, s'il-vous please.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.854
Here you go, pal. Visor con Dios.

20:37.524 --> 20:38.773
You're not even keeping them?!

20:38.774 --> 20:41.433
It... It makes no sense.
You're wasting money and visors.

20:41.434 --> 20:42.853
It's not a waste. I practiced all year,

20:42.854 --> 20:44.444
- and I'm really good at this.
- But it's pointless.

20:44.469 --> 20:46.353
The pointlessness is the point.

20:46.354 --> 20:47.933
You want to be happy, Frank,

20:47.934 --> 20:50.393
find something stupid that you
can do better than anybody else

20:50.394 --> 20:51.484
and do it a whole bunch.

20:54.274 --> 20:57.223
From the farthest reaches
of the Swiss Alps,

20:57.224 --> 20:59.813
spawn of man and beast,

20:59.814 --> 21:03.273
brought in chains
at tremendous expense...

21:03.274 --> 21:06.393
Mountain Goat Boy!

21:08.394 --> 21:11.103
A miracle of balance and nimbleness,

21:11.104 --> 21:12.683
there is nothing he cannot ascend

21:12.684 --> 21:14.773
using only his hind hooves!

21:18.314 --> 21:20.223
Hey, Frank! Catch!

21:25.508 --> 21:30.508
