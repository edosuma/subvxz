to take on more shifts at work.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.965
Jim! I just had surgery.
I don't know if my kidney can handle it.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.551
Oh, well, it's my kidney,
so it can definitely handle it.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.761
Good! Okay, everyone!

12:00.845 --> 12:06.142
Bethany will just work longer and harder,
and Kelly's credit score will be fine.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.811
- [CHUCKLES]
- Hey, Jim. Jacket.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.313
- Oh, Peruvian wool, right?
- [MIRANDA] Mmm-hmm.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.400
- You can hover on it. He likes that.
- Oh, you like this?

12:14.483 --> 12:17.945
- I don't necessarily like that.
- No, you said. You said, "hover."

12:18.028 --> 12:19.655
- It's better than touching.
- See?

12:19.738 --> 12:21.657
[BOTH GRUNTING]

12:39.508 --> 12:40.843
[PANTS]

12:40.926 --> 12:45.222
Wow. You really know your way around
a medieval torture implement, Patrick.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.390
Thank you.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.726
Well, if I hadn't been wearing armor,

12:48.809 --> 12:52.021
I'm fairly certain your last strike
would've severed my subclavian artery.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.315
- Oh. [CHUCKLES]
- I would have bled out in under a minute.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.066
Oh, that's really sweet of you to say.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.780
I'm, uh... I'm glad you finally agreed
to go on this date with me.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.116
Oh, I didn't realize...

13:07.995 --> 13:08.829
Yeah.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.248
Yeah, me, too.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.672
Kelly. Oh! [LAUGHS]

13:18.756 --> 13:20.549
What a coincidence, huh?

13:20.633 --> 13:23.302
We're both in this garage
at the same time.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.803
Stop following me, Jim.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.139
Oh, sorry.
Don't want to disturb you at work.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.351
- I'll just watch you in silence.
- Yeah.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.230
You'd buy this painting
for 800 bucks, right?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.481
Hmm...

13:37.525 --> 13:39.109
Needs more brown.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.487
Oh. Oh! [CHUCKLES]

13:41.570 --> 13:45.866
Look at this. How embarrassing.
You weren't supposed to see this.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.828
This is from a date I was on,
just this morning.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.707
With my girlfriend.
You must be pretty proud of me, huh?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.709
Are you kidding me, Jim?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.670
No, I'm not kidding.
I have a girlfriend.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.549
- You finally have a girlfriend?
- Ow! Yes, I have a girlfriend.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.134
- [BOTH LAUGHING]
- [GROANS] Oh!

14:04.218 --> 14:07.137
I thought when you joined Color Guard,
all hope was lost.

14:07.221 --> 14:10.182
Then you picked up
that ribbon dancing thing.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.475
[LAUGHING]

14:11.559 --> 14:14.186
If some girl's into you,
she must be freaky.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.938
What kind of stuff are you guys into?

14:16.021 --> 14:19.024
Oh, mostly just get lost
in each other's eyes.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.402
No, I mean, physically.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.029
Oh, uh, no, no,
we haven't kissed or anything yet.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.200
But, uh, we've had
whispered conversations. Very close.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.954
If you haven't kissed a girl,
she's not your girlfriend.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.874
Okay, Jim? Look it up.

14:37.167 --> 14:40.921
I need to kiss her. I need to kiss her.

14:46.010 --> 14:46.969
[GRUNTS]

14:47.595 --> 14:48.596
Perfect.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.808
Loop-de-loop. Mmm-hmm.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.311
Set this up over there.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.149
- Miranda. Can I ask you a question?
- Okay.

15:00.232 --> 15:05.279
Okay. If I was a guy and you were a girl,
what kind of kisses would you like?

15:05.362 --> 15:06.363
Wet ones.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.825
Wet ones, yes. Wet
ones would be perfect.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.578
[BREATHES DEEPLY] Okay.
Thank you, I have to skedaddle.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.288
Aren't you gonna help me
with the roller coaster?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.081
- I have to get cement.
- Cement?

15:16.165 --> 15:18.000
For your, uh, statue. For your statue.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.670
- [GASPS] A statue?
- With a big head and everything.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.006
- Oh, can I come?
- Uh, no. No.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.841
Oh, okay.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.594
But you'll be back to help me
with the roller coaster, right?

15:28.677 --> 15:29.970
- Oh.
- [ENGINE STARTS]

[DOOR CLOSES]

15:35.309 --> 15:38.896
Oh, Dad, wanna help me build
the roller coaster for Miranda World?

15:38.979 --> 15:40.981
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll be right back.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
Okay, great.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.737
- Right back. So, like, five minutes or...
- Five or ten.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.615
Five or ten. So one, two,

15:49.698 --> 15:54.995
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten. Now?

15:55.079 --> 15:56.622
[TIRES SCREECHING]

15:57.247 --> 15:58.499
Okay.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.752
I'll just wait here for you.

[JIM CLEARS THROAT]

16:19.269 --> 16:21.230
Jim? What are you doing here?

16:21.313 --> 16:24.274
You're supposed to be home,
acting natural.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.069
I'm tired of acting natural.

16:27.152 --> 16:31.532
I wanna act totally unnatural
with you, Bethany.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.033
Oh, my word.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.870
- I hope you like your kisses wet.
- Oh!

16:41.083 --> 16:44.294
Oh, Jim. What's gotten into you?

16:44.378 --> 16:46.088
My brother.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.048
[BOTH MOANING]

16:51.552 --> 16:57.933
So I think we should set a price point
at 700 per.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.562
That's dollars. Per painting.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.857
- I'm afraid I'm not interested.
- What?

17:04.940 --> 17:07.317
These paintings
are clearly the work of a novice.

17:07.401 --> 17:11.155
Yes, there's a certain unrefined charm
beneath all the layers of insecurity,

17:11.238 --> 17:13.781
but, truth be told, these pieces
are prosaic, derivative,

17:13.866 --> 17:16.492
and frankly not nearly as arresting
as you promised.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.246
I never said that they were arresting.
I said that they were sexy.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.497
They're not that, either.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.833
- Excuse me?
- Dad, it's okay.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.044
My daughter has obvious talent.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.712
She is special.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.256
And if you can't see that,
then I feel sorry for you, pal.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.466
My sister told me you'd do this.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.801
Oh, she's just mad at me
'cause I dumped her.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.927
She broke up with you.

17:34.011 --> 17:39.516
We're done here because, obviously,
this guy has no taste or vision,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.143
and based on his sister's body,

17:41.226 --> 17:43.479
he probably has weird moles
all over his back.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.689
Thanks for nothing, Carl.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.527
"Not sexy"?
Nobody talks to my daughter that way!

17:53.781 --> 17:55.324
[GRUNTS] That's a loop-de-loop.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.410
No. Dang it. Okay.

some alone time with you.

when I'm back here doing this.

Did Patrick see me fall?
Did he look worried?

22:49.826 --> 22:52.788
Honey, we're all worried.
Yes, he's worried.

22:52.871 --> 22:53.830
- [SIGHS]
- Are you okay?

22:53.914 --> 22:55.290
I'm great.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.541
[MANAGER] Bethany?

22:56.625 --> 22:57.918
You're fired.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.213
[STAMMERS] No, you can't fire me.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.757
- I need this job.
- Go.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.011
I could...

23:14.267 --> 23:15.560
Just out of curiosity,

23:15.644 --> 23:18.063
how long does that free
grocery promotion go on for?

23:29.032 --> 23:31.743
Well? What do you think?

23:31.827 --> 23:33.662
It's the start of your new art gallery.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.456
Your art is so good
we could sell it anywhere.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.584
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.755
Well, let's get the rest of this crap
in the house.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.227
So, as you can see,
I was on my way to get cement

23:57.310 --> 23:58.895
when I heard your news report.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.565
It's a good thing I did
because I was there to help.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.067
On my way getting cement,
which is what I was doing.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.778
I was getting cement. Yeah.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.323
Mom, you got a letter from eviction.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.993
[SIGHING] Eviction?

24:14.411 --> 24:17.164
We only have two weeks to pay the rent.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.125
Two weeks?

24:20.208 --> 24:22.919
That's plenty of time
to get Miranda World up and running.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.046
Our money problems are solved!

24:26.464 --> 24:28.008
Let's go.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.553
