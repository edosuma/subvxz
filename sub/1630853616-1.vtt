WEBVTT

00:55.472 --> 00:57.557
Oh. Mm-hmm.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.559
Mm-hmm.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.852
Okay, here we go.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.563
Here we go. Uh…

01:03.646 --> 01:04.564
Hey, world.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.401
I'm Teddy Jackson,
and I wanna welcome you to Teddybands.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.402
Ha-ha!

01:09.486 --> 01:12.614
All right, listen,
weights are about to be no more.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.115
It's all about the bands.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.701
Why? Because this is
where you get the best resistance.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.079
You can stretch it,
do whatever you want with it.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.539
The best thing is
to get you some reps in there though.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.708
-Get a lot of reps to where you feel it.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.543
Shit, I felt it. Goddamn.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.797
It's my eye. It got me
right on the side of the eye. Dammit.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.134
One hundred.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.596
What's up, world?

01:36.679 --> 01:39.474
Teddy Jackson here,
welcoming you to Teddyburn,

01:39.557 --> 01:43.561
where I'm introducing
two pieces of non-breathable plastic.

01:43.645 --> 01:48.191
Think about five garbage bags
wrapped up into two good pieces,

01:48.274 --> 01:51.444
where you just
can't let nothing out, except sweat.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.905
Oh, man. Whoo!

01:55.949 --> 01:57.367
I'm getting dizzy. Shit.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.494
Wait. Fitness is…

01:59.577 --> 02:00.411
Nah.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.249
Hey, what's going on, guys?

02:04.332 --> 02:08.211
Teddy Jackson here,
and I wanna introduce you to the Teddybar.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.839
I already know what you're thinking.
"Teddy, what is it?"

02:10.922 --> 02:14.050
I'll tell you exactly what it is.
It's an adjustable pull-up bar.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.051
Why did I make it?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.303
Because some pull-up bars
are just too high.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.806
So this one adjusts to your comfort level.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.601
That's right. Adjust it
to the right height and pull up all night.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.562
Let's go!

02:25.645 --> 02:26.855
Let's get it! Oh yeah!

02:26.938 --> 02:28.773
-Oh!

02:28.857 --> 02:30.483
Oh shit! Lori!

02:31.151 --> 02:32.694
God. Godda…

02:32.777 --> 02:34.404
Aw, come on!

02:35.613 --> 02:36.614
Lori, the…

02:37.448 --> 02:41.411
-The Teddybar fell on my head! Goddamn it!
-Oh, Teddy.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.204
It does it every time I'm taping.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.999
You need to come up
with something a little less dangerous.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.605
You may not talk to me,

03:51.439 --> 03:53.149
but everybody talks to him.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.829
I gotta say, it's a real honor.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.377
Working on this guy
the last couple of days,

04:12.460 --> 04:14.963
but he trained with
French special forces so he's tough as--

04:15.046 --> 04:16.798
Shh.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.679
Sorry, my, uh, wife's leftovers.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.608
Before we begin I'd like
to tell you a little about myself.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.779
I was raised by my grandfather

04:41.531 --> 04:44.867
on a frozen lake 50 miles from nowhere.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.203
He was a kind man.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.207
He taught me many useful things.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.629
One brisk afternoon,
while we were fishing on the frozen lake,

04:56.713 --> 04:59.757
we saw a large form approaching.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.843
It was a grizzly.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.762
My grandfather yelled at me to run,

05:05.346 --> 05:08.683
so I took off as fast
as my little legs would carry me.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.685
And when I looked back,

05:11.644 --> 05:13.062
I learned the last thing

05:13.146 --> 05:16.482
that my unfortunate grandfather
would ever teach me.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.153
Bears have very sharp claws,

05:20.236 --> 05:26.701
which they use to fillet the skin
off their still-breathing victims.

05:27.493 --> 05:32.040
I share this with you
because when you beg for your life,

05:32.123 --> 05:33.958
I'm not gonna hear your screams.

05:35.084 --> 05:40.006
Any feeling I once had dried up
on that frozen lake long ago.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.216
You're wasting your time.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.595
After I remove your eyes, your ears,

05:45.678 --> 05:48.681
and balls, all your sensory organs,

05:49.182 --> 05:52.310
if you still haven't told me
what I need to know…

05:52.393 --> 05:55.021
-Please.
-…I'm going to fillet you

05:55.104 --> 05:57.231
like that bear did my grandfather.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.151
-It's Grenkin! Velvel Grenkin.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.403
-275 Castro Street.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.655
Velvel Grenkin, he's there, I swear.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.117
I'm gonna tell
my grandkids of this, one day.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.411
Or…

06:10.912 --> 06:11.871
nobody

06:11.954 --> 06:12.789
ever.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.625
I like you.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.129
Tell your wife wild juniper's the secret.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.547
Not the store-bought.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.468
It looks like bunny shit,
so better smell it first.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.015
Who the hell was that?

06:31.724 --> 06:32.558
No!

06:39.232 --> 06:41.067
Good morning, Yorktown.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.569
It's ten past eight
on a beautiful Monday morning.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.072
None of my kids talk to me.
I don't know where they are.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.281
Look who's up, huh?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.616
Happy birthday.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.493
What time is it?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.537
I think it's, um…

06:53.454 --> 06:55.289
I think it's baby-making time.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.042
We can do it in that position
that don't even feel good.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.460
It feels good for you.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.088
-I'm saying, for me it's just more about…
-A baby?

07:02.171 --> 07:03.631
…survival of the species.

07:03.714 --> 07:04.590
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.300
I'm just trying to break it down to you.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.301
I hear you.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.846
But you know
you can't Teddy that one, right?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.514
What… What does that mean, honey?

07:12.014 --> 07:14.142
That's what they call it at the firm now.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.103
If a paralegal screws up,
they say they Teddyed it.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.522
They named a screw-up after me?

07:19.605 --> 07:23.151
-You're actually a verb now.
-Okay, listen, that's the past.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.653
Why talk about the past?
I wanna focus on the present.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.655
Look at this.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.574
Come on, look at it.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.118
Onancock, Virginia?

07:32.201 --> 07:34.537
I got us a little cabin for your birthday.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.539
-Tons of baby-making time.
-Uh…

07:36.622 --> 07:40.501
Baby, what is this? I can't read this.
There's no toner on the page.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.295
It's the reservation, babe.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.422
We leave tonight. It's perfect.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.339
Thank you.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.800
I'm not messing up
your birthdays anymore, babe.

07:47.884 --> 07:48.718
On a serious note,

07:50.052 --> 07:52.972
did you talk to Marty
about your business idea?

07:53.055 --> 07:56.058
I did not talk to Marty yet,
but there's a reason.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.896
-I'm just waiting for the right time.
-There's never gonna be a right time.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.022
You just have to do it.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.733
You're absolutely right.
Know what? I'm just gonna do it.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.943
-I'm gonna pitch it to him today.
-Today?

08:06.027 --> 08:09.363
He's gonna fall in love with it.
The money that'll come will be ridiculous.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.492
I'm gonna pay our tax lien off.
I'm gonna fix this place up.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.534
It's gonna happen.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.915
You think maybe we could start
with some light bulbs and toner?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.250
That's what Teddying it looks like, right?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.336
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, all right. I'll get the bulb.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.253
And toner.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.547
And the toner.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.012
♪ Light the blunts up
When I walk in the building ♪

08:33.095 --> 08:36.140
♪ Gravy getting buck
Every time I get up in it… ♪

08:36.891 --> 08:38.726
-Morning.
-Teddy. Oh, I know. I know.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.396
-I've been meaning to come by the gym.
-Well, you better come, Betty!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.649
-There, I will.
-Dream hard and punch harder!

08:44.732 --> 08:45.900
-Thanks.
-Here you go, guys.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.985
-Marty's Fitness. Right up the street.
-Thanks.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.154
Stop lunchin' and get to punchin'!

08:51.155 --> 08:53.074
Non-contact boxing, Marty.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.535
Non-contact boxing?

08:55.618 --> 08:56.577
This is big.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.871
This is the whole breakdown of the idea.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.499
Now, the big thing here
is that it's still boxing,

09:01.582 --> 09:03.167
without the contact.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.794
That's the beauty of the idea.

09:04.877 --> 09:09.048
Look at this. I'm getting that same burn
that I normally would, right?

09:14.512 --> 09:15.763
But I don't touch you.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.266
I got so excited
when I started to get into the idea,

09:18.349 --> 09:21.435
I decided to put up
the first workout video.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.020
Just to get a response.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.021
Three comments.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.275
And the questions are simple.
They're like, "What is this?"

09:27.984 --> 09:28.818
This…

09:28.901 --> 09:30.152
Digest it.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.948
…could be the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.701
Sales is not your forte.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.537
I'll be honest you.
I don't know what that word means.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.289
What are you… What are you saying?

09:41.956 --> 09:43.958
-Let me show you something.
-Yeah, sure.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.670
See these flyers you made up?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.423
I spent my entire marketing budget
on these things,

09:50.506 --> 09:51.966
and we ain't got one bite.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.303
Marty, they're gonna come
through that door any day, any minute.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.888
-You just gotta be patient. You know that.
-Well, they would be.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.891
If you had put the address on this thing!

10:00.975 --> 10:01.809
What?

10:03.811 --> 10:07.064
-I mean, who really needs addresses?
-My customers.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.191
Then they'll call you, Marty.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.235
You left out the phone number too.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.278
Dammit, did I?

10:12.361 --> 10:15.489
Teddy, you're a nice guy. You really are.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.199
But I need a dude with some grit.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.159
I got grit.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.953
Are you firing me?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.415
I need a closer, Ted.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.376
Non-contact boxing.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.045
That's your closer, man.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.171
I'm sorry, Ted.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.381
Marty, I've worked hard on this.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.180
So stupid.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.252
Yes, ma'am?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.754
Ready to go back to work?

11:53.838 --> 11:57.341
The only thing I'm working on
is my breakfast.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.385
Your breakfast can wait.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.387
I've got a blue-chip client,

12:01.470 --> 12:07.476
and he's got a red-hot stack
with a two-million-dollar fee.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.564
With respect, I'm listening.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.149
I thought so.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.776
It's a two-phase extraction.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.362
One million dollars for each one.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.449
Payday like this comes along
once in a decade.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.118
-Where?
-Onancock, Virginia.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.412
- 00 p.m. Jump on it.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.634
-Oh. Hey.
-Hey, there he is, my little avocado.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.555
So, GPS says we'll be there by- 00 p.m.
I am so excited.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.557
Well, if that's the case,
I'll go get dressed now.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.350
-Okay, sounds good. Yeah.
-All right?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.311
-Oh, hey.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.937
-Hmm?
-How'd it go with Marty?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.440
-How'd it go with Marty?
-Yeah.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.567
-It was, uh… Yeah, it was great.
-Yeah?

12:56.650 --> 12:59.570
He said it wasn't, like,
the dumbest thing he's ever heard, so.

12:59.653 --> 13:00.571
-Great.
-Yeah.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.199
-I'm proud of you.
-I'm proud of you too.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.165
Hit me.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.458
You're reconfirmed.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.544
Payment on-site in cash
at completion of job.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.546
Somebody will be waiting for you there.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.882
It's house 1465.

13:19.965 --> 13:20.966
Groovy.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.688
Wait, a day spa?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.274
-I thought we had a cabin.
-We do have a cabin.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.528
I'm gonna go meet the guy at the cabin.
Before I do that I wanted to let you out

13:40.611 --> 13:42.613
because I got you two hours at a spa.

13:43.364 --> 13:46.700
Okay, Teddy Jackson, you are killing it.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.993
-You like that?
-Yeah.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.329
Babe, I got you set up
for the whole shebang.

13:50.412 --> 13:53.374
-You're getting a facial, mani-pedi--
-I love it. Okay, I love it.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.375
-Okay?
-Thank you.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.835

14:21.318 --> 14:25.364
♪ Some mistakes are worth making… ♪

14:25.447 --> 14:26.490
Ah.

14:32.454 --> 14:36.500
Lori,
I'm not gonna Teddy this one.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.211
Got the magic box, let's go.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.714
Come on.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.678
Shit. Damn it.

14:52.808 --> 14:56.186
This is nice.
This whole thing is nice, right here.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.406
You're early.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.117
Well, if you're on time, you're late.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.535
Ain't that right?

15:11.619 --> 15:14.663
Do me a favor, grab this box.
You know, I got bottles. Get the bottles.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.373
Whoo!

15:17.499 --> 15:19.793
My legs. You're big, ain't you?

15:22.463 --> 15:25.174
Oh, this ain't bad. This ain't bad at all.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.218
I'm glad I made it up here
before it got dark though.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.429
That would've been something else.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.891
Champagne?

15:33.974 --> 15:35.267
That's to celebrate.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.896
I'm gonna do a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.191
This is… all part of your method?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.318
No, man, this is just a warm-up.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.571
When you ain't did it in a while,
things can get a little animal.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.323
Yeah. You know what I'm talking about.

15:49.406 --> 15:53.160
Gotta tap into that danger zone.
Start using safe words.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.578
I can't say that I do.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.748
Oh, you probably got safe sentences.
Safe paragraphs.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.963
Where the bathroom at? I gotta pee, man.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.047
Behind you.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.173
Oh, shit.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.136
-Oh! Damn.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.764
Whoo!

16:14.390 --> 16:15.391
There it is.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.436
I'm sorry if you can hear this.
I got a strong stream.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.815
Been like this since I was six.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.652
It's called "a consistent flow,"
that's what the doctor said. Phew.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.154
A little above average for my size.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.282
I'm at the tail end of it now, though.

16:35.160 --> 16:35.995
Oh God.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.166
Man, I'm surprised I made it this far.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.044
I'm ready to get to work now though.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.380
Well, follow me.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.340
Oh, you gonna take me on the tour.

16:48.424 --> 16:52.261
What is it, a game room?
You got a ping-pong table down here?

16:53.721 --> 16:56.682
Probably… Hey, how are you doing?
You with the rental team?

16:56.765 --> 16:57.891
Good to see you.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.643
Oh, my. Hold on. What the…

16:59.727 --> 17:01.145
-No.
-Uh-uh.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.354
Excuse me.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.733
We have work to do.
You're not leaving until it's done.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.401
We…

17:07.484 --> 17:09.445
We got work to do? Oh. Uh…

17:10.070 --> 17:11.030
Mr. Coughlin,

17:11.613 --> 17:13.115
allow me to introduce

17:14.074 --> 17:15.743
the Man from Toronto.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.288
What? Hold on. Wait a second.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.332
The Man from Toronto?
Just give me… Give a second. Give me…

17:22.416 --> 17:23.250
Hmm.

17:23.917 --> 17:24.918
Wait, hold on.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.296
Just hold on a second.

17:27.379 --> 17:32.468
I know a guy that knows a guy
that saw you do this once.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.803
Said it was life-changing.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.473
And now I get to witness it firsthand.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.474
Mm.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.225
Unless, of course, he talks.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.855
"Unless, of course, he talks."

17:45.898 --> 17:48.484
He said, if he talks,

17:49.359 --> 17:51.195
then things can be different.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.363
Because you, you know who I am.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.823
You know me.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.243
You guys all…
Everybody here must know who I am.

17:59.828 --> 18:03.624
Now, if you know what I know,
that's that I love to communicate.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.626
So let's figure out the best way to talk.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.835
Right?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.296
-Please.
-I hope you understand what I'm saying.

18:09.379 --> 18:13.217
Last I checked,
communication is key to understanding.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.678
Is it muggy? Are you guys… Is it a little…

18:16.762 --> 18:18.514
The air, right? Back up. Back up.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.642
Put the hammer down and back up.
You're crowding me, okay?

18:21.725 --> 18:25.646
And I can't do whatever it is
I'm here to do with you on my ass.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.523
Now, what you need to know

18:28.107 --> 18:29.149
is that…

18:29.233 --> 18:32.111
I don't know what is going on.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.654
I don't know what they want.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.740
They called me the Man from Toronto.
I don't even know who that is.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.451
-Give them what they want. Is it money?
-No.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.286
He starts with the eyes.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.456
You said what? I start…

18:44.540 --> 18:46.834
You start with the eyes.

18:46.917 --> 18:47.918
Hmm.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.878
-You're gonna listen.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.796
I love eyes.

18:50.879 --> 18:54.174
I would hate for your eyes
to be next on my activity list.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.717
I don't wanna do this.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.761
I don't like none of this.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.639
-I don't like nasty stuff.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.015
I don't like blood.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.686
They say he filleted
an entire poker parlor in Minnesota.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.147
I… I did what in Minnesota?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.275
Filleted the entire poker parlor.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.194
Goddamn right I did.
Don't nobody else say anything.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.613
You know why?
Because at this point I'm getting angry.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.782
I'm getting angry,
and I'm about to get real active.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.827
Look at my thumbs. Because
it's the last thing you're gonna see.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.163
Look at this. Look at me, I'm gonna do it.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.957
-Oh, God, no.
-What? Do you want me to do it?

19:27.040 --> 19:27.875
No!

19:27.958 --> 19:29.209
-Do you want me--
-No!

19:29.293 --> 19:30.210
-I'm gonna do it!
-No.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.171
-Do you think I'm playing?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.715
-I can't hear you! Is that what you want?
-Ah! No.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.633
-Is that what you want? Then say it!
-No.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.218
-Say it!
-Okay, I'll tell you!

19:38.302 --> 19:39.261
Say it!

19:39.845 --> 19:42.681
Okay, 4-4-5-0-8

19:43.265 --> 19:44.349
12-53-C.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.895
I'm sorry, please don't.
Please don't hurt me.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.980
All right, stop it. Stop it.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.648
-Let me get myself together.
-Please…

19:51.732 --> 19:53.734
Let me get myself together.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.194
Please. Don't hurt…

19:55.277 --> 19:57.070
-Is that… Is that what you needed?

19:57.154 --> 19:59.615
-Hey. It's me.
-You saved our lives.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.326
Yeah. Tell the colonel we got the codes.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.535
And the Man from Toronto

20:03.619 --> 20:05.996
is gonna continue on
to Washington, DC to meet.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.790
-Huh?

20:08.874 --> 20:09.708
What's that?

20:12.628 --> 20:14.755
FBI! Don't move!

20:20.469 --> 20:23.222
-Oh, no! Don't shoot!
-Don't move!

20:23.305 --> 20:24.223
I'm not moving!

20:24.306 --> 20:27.059
Don't shoot me!
I'm not moving! I'm not moving!

20:27.142 --> 20:28.435
Don't shoot!

20:32.022 --> 20:33.732
Shots fired on the ground.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.821
Whoa!

20:40.697 --> 20:42.532
Ah! Ah!

20:45.744 --> 20:46.662
My car!

20:47.996 --> 20:49.957
No! Ah!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.751
Oh!

20:52.834 --> 20:53.710
-Shit!

20:53.794 --> 20:54.711
We got him.

20:55.921 --> 20:56.964
What'd I do?

20:59.132 --> 21:03.011
It was a low toner situation.
Me and my wife, we were going to a cabin.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.889
But because of the low toner,
I couldn't make out the address.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.350
I didn't know if it was a six or an eight.

21:08.433 --> 21:12.104
Look, I'm not the Man from Toronto, okay?

21:12.187 --> 21:14.064
I'm actually just an idiot from Yorktown.

21:14.147 --> 21:17.693
-We're well aware, Mr. Jackson.
-So please guys, let me go.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.236
Show him.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.240
-This phone…
-Mm. That don't look good.

21:23.323 --> 21:27.160
…was recovered on the scene
from the man who led you into the cabin.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.831
Just before the attack, a text was sent
to the former Venezuelan colonel

21:30.914 --> 21:32.124
Sebastián Marín.

21:32.624 --> 21:36.044
Last year Marín staged a coup
to overthrow his own government.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.754
He was stopped by US Intelligence,

21:37.838 --> 21:40.632
but he and his wife escaped
before they were apprehended.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.010
He swore revenge on us ever since.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.512
-Marín has been planning an attack.
-We can't find him.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.140
The Man from Toronto was our only way in.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.268
And now Marín believes that
you are the Man from Toronto.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.853
Our only way to find him

21:52.936 --> 21:55.897
is if you continue
to be the Man from Toronto.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.949
Why did I just get word
that information was secured?

22:06.533 --> 22:07.826
Not by me, it wasn't.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.954
Some cut-rate operator just got lucky?

22:11.538 --> 22:13.915
Or made a giant mistake.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.882
Park it along that tree line.
Right there.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.470
This is everything we know
about the Man from Toronto.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.307
An expert in over 23 martial arts.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.225
It's believed when engaging with clients

22:32.309 --> 22:35.479
he uses 19th century
American poetry as code.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.646
Some mess, huh?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.565
It got me out of bed.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.610
Intel suggests he grew up
on a frozen lake in Canada,

22:41.693 --> 22:43.236
50 miles from nowhere.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.366
After witnessing his grandfather
being eaten alive by a bear,

22:47.449 --> 22:48.867
he was left an orphan.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.370
He's basically a ghost.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.997
Apart from one known contact,

22:54.081 --> 22:57.250
a female by the name of Debora,
who we believe is his handler,

22:57.834 --> 22:59.336
he operates alone.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.559
Who the hell still uses Hotmail?

23:15.310 --> 23:17.938
Please, guys. Please, can I just go?

23:18.021 --> 23:20.065
You're supposed to meet Marín
tomorrow morning in DC.

23:20.148 --> 23:23.110
-Are you compliant?
-No, I will not do it, okay?

23:23.193 --> 23:26.488
I'm not supposed to be in DC tomorrow.
I'm supposed to be with my wife.

23:26.571 --> 23:30.534
-And if I miss this birthday--
-Santoro can take care of your wife.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.629
Who is he?

23:43.422 --> 23:45.632
Santoro is the best we have.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.218
I'll pose as your wife's personal butler,

23:48.301 --> 23:51.638
escort her on 24 hours
of shopping and luxury

23:51.721 --> 23:54.349
before meeting you
tomorrow night for dinner in Washington.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.436
You will do no such thing.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.229
She'll be in great hands, sir.

23:59.312 --> 24:02.774
Oh, she ain't gonna be in his hands.
Not those soft, well-manicured hands.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.609
I'm not passing my wife off to this man.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.738
A good-looking man like this,
that's gonna obviously be charming.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.908
Why can't it be his ugly ass?
Why can't he go?

24:12.409 --> 24:13.910
If it was him, no problem.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.205
Stop your ass right here. No.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.875
There are lives at stake here, Teddy.
Please.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.710
According to Oscar's phone,

24:21.793 --> 24:24.087
the meet is at the art museum
in DC tomorrow.

24:24.171 --> 24:28.091
You draw Marín out,
we grab him, you're done.

24:28.675 --> 24:30.677
All right, if… if I have to do this,

24:30.760 --> 24:33.096
then I want you guys
to do something for me.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.014
Okay.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.266
I got a tax lien
that I've had for quite some time,

24:36.349 --> 24:37.893
that's really affecting my life.

24:38.768 --> 24:39.978
Tax lien.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.522
I also have an American Express debt.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.274
You gotta pay it back every month,

24:44.357 --> 24:46.651
and they never
explained that to me in full.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.986
-Great.
-Okay.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.488
Okay, perfect. We got it.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.240
-There's a Visa situation that's the same.
-Visa?

24:52.324 --> 24:55.327
You can pay that one off monthly, but I…

24:55.869 --> 24:57.496
I just… I botched that.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.373
While we're here,
I owe my cousin Carl $300.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.835
-So if you could just send him a wire…
-All right.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.671
But make it look like it came from me,
'cause he got a record.

25:06.755 --> 25:10.759
Sir, does your wife
prefer Swedish or deep tissue?

25:11.259 --> 25:12.886
What are you talking about?

25:14.554 --> 25:16.348
No chatter on the network.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.892
Did this grifter
leave a signature of any kind?

25:18.975 --> 25:22.103
It would take a real pro
to make it look this amateur.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.606
Did you grab the password
on the email address?

25:24.689 --> 25:26.733
The algorithm is four characters in.

25:26.816 --> 25:30.111
You have two hours and 47 minutes
to full hack.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.154
Too slow.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.114
What have you got so far?

25:33.198 --> 25:38.203
Well, so far
they have P, A, S, and S.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.412
He's toying with us.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.415
It'd be rude not to play along.

25:44.834 --> 25:47.170
Hey! What's going on? I'm Teddy Jackson,

25:47.254 --> 25:51.591
and I wanna welcome you guys
to my first ever non-contact boxing class.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.927
It's called Teddybox.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.846
It's all the "wow" without the "ow."

25:56.930 --> 26:00.350
Maybe you got somebody you got
a little altercation with or had one with.

26:00.433 --> 26:03.478
Or maybe there's somebody that
just doesn't need to receive your love.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.439
Okay? Let's go. I'm talking to you, Doug.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.482
You know who you are.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.775
Back when I was in school,

26:08.858 --> 26:11.444
Doug used to pop me
in the back of the head with fruit cups.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.863
Well, right now, Doug,
I'm about to kick your ass.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.824
Drive into a trap, you're on your own.

26:15.907 --> 26:16.741
One, two!

26:16.825 --> 26:18.493
That's one way to look at it.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.497
The other way is
their trap's gonna drive right into me.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.377
Mm.

26:28.128 --> 26:31.548
-Hey, babe.
-Hey, you. I was starting to get worried.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.551
You started to get worried?

26:34.634 --> 26:37.846
I actually called 'cause
I got another surprise for you.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.015
There's somebody there
to actually meet you.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.267
Yeah, I, uh, just met Santoro.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.352
He's amazing.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.398
-Did you know he went to Harvard?
-No, I did not know he went to Harvard.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.858
What else did he say?

26:49.941 --> 26:54.404
Just that Marty
desperately needed you for a presentation.

26:54.487 --> 26:57.115
Why didn't you tell me
an Equinox rep was interested

26:57.198 --> 26:58.783
in your non-contact boxing thing?

26:58.867 --> 27:01.286
Babe, I was gonna tell you.
Stop, girl, I was gonna tell you.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.579
You're not mad, right?

27:02.662 --> 27:05.081
Are you kidding? I'm proud of you.

27:05.165 --> 27:09.794
Santoro explained Equinox is
paying for a DC shopping excursion,

27:09.878 --> 27:12.047
dinner tomorrow night anywhere we want,

27:12.130 --> 27:13.506
private dance lessons.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.133
Is he there, babe? Let me talk to him.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.344
I just wanna go over
the last couple of things.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.346
-He wants to talk to you.
-Oh.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.477
-Sir.
-Don't you "sir" me. You cut the shit.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.647
Ain't gonna be no dancing.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.814
No dancing.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.233
Perhaps it's best you focus

27:32.317 --> 27:35.403
on the very big presentation
you have ahead of you.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.989
-I'll take good care of Lori.
-That's "Miss Jackson."

27:38.573 --> 27:41.409
Miss Teddy Jackson.
Matter of fact, call her Teddy.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.494
Okay.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.789
Chiquitito ese, me la tiene pelada.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.416
And he speaks Spanish. Girl.

27:49.000 --> 27:49.834
Hey.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.503
What a nice guy.

27:51.586 --> 27:54.130
Um… Okay, babe. I love you.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.173
I love you too.

28:02.972 --> 28:04.307
Washington awaits.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.851
♪ She got a big bad dumper, drop it low ♪

28:06.935 --> 28:09.396
♪Mama called me
And she happy with the growth ♪

28:16.111 --> 28:18.571
The meet is near
the entrance of the museum.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.241
They'll say,
"O the bleeding drops of red."

28:21.324 --> 28:22.158
Then you'll say,

28:22.242 --> 28:25.912
"Where on the deck my captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead." Got it?

28:26.955 --> 28:28.748
No, I do not have it. What?

28:28.832 --> 28:29.874
What was that?

28:29.958 --> 28:33.420
When did we turn this
into a Shakespeare play in the damn park?

28:33.503 --> 28:35.922
-What are you… Are you serious?
-It's Walt Whitman.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.258
The Man from Toronto
always picks a password

28:38.341 --> 28:40.009
from 19th-century American poetry.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.302
-Oh.
-It's in the file, Teddy.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.222
Oh. Okay, then that clears it up.
It was in the file.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.099
As if I know what I'm reading!

28:46.182 --> 28:48.518
I told Lawrence you couldn't do this.
I told her!

28:48.601 --> 28:49.602
Listen to me, man.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.772
What… what else do I need?
I just wanna get it over with.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.315
Lawrence, you copy?

28:54.399 --> 28:55.358
Copy.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.944
-I gotta put it somewhere.
-You didn't say that.

28:58.945 --> 29:01.781
All right, you're good right here.
Just get that.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.367
What is… What is this?

29:05.076 --> 29:06.411
That's how we can track you.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.873
-This is how I should feel safe?
-That's top quality, man.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.717
Bleeding drops of red.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.606
Y'all could've given me an earpiece
or something, so I can know y'all…

29:37.317 --> 29:39.861
Y'all can hear me, right?
Y'all still can hear me?

29:50.580 --> 29:53.583
Get it together, Teddy. Come on, let's go.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.212
Bleeding tops of…

29:57.295 --> 29:58.379
No. Shit.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.887
All right, the meet is on.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.100
O the bleeding drops of red.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.602
Oh, yeah.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.104
They are.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.315
Yep.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.775
Because on the deck…

30:18.858 --> 30:20.944
We all know what happened on the deck.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.987
That's where I hit my head.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.489
You heard what I said.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.534
What the hell is he doing?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.119
I'm him. I'm Toronto.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.538
What?

30:32.205 --> 30:33.206
Daniela Marín.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.751
Uh-uh.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.172
My colleagues Luís and Andrés.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.133
It is an honor for all of us.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.349
I'm eager to meet the Colonel.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.726
Once the next phase is done.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.103
No, it's one phase, right?

30:55.186 --> 30:57.939
I give you the numbers.
After that, I get the money.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.232
It's a oner.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.401
No, no. Always two.

31:01.484 --> 31:02.944
No. That's not the deal.

31:03.027 --> 31:03.862
The deal…

31:05.071 --> 31:07.574
The deal was to meet the Colonel here.

31:07.657 --> 31:08.575
They're on the move.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.035
Goin' somewhere else?

31:11.119 --> 31:13.204
Somebody's gotta be watching. Right? We…

31:13.997 --> 31:14.831
Somebody.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.709
-Let's go.
-Nobody sees nothing, huh?

31:17.792 --> 31:20.545
-Are you sure nobody else is watching us?
-Should I intercept?

31:20.628 --> 31:22.130
Negative. We need Marín.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.924
I'm in pursuit.

31:28.761 --> 31:29.721
Follow them.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.892
Follow those SUVs. Go!

31:36.311 --> 31:37.520
I got visual on them.

31:40.690 --> 31:45.486
Well, I am going now.
The Man from Toronto has left the scene.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.821
Who would've thought it?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.866
First time the Man from Toronto
has ever sat bitch.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.785
The vehicles are entering
the underpass. We've lost visual.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.122
Davis, do you have a visual on Jackson?

31:57.749 --> 31:58.917
"Negative."

31:59.000 --> 32:00.335
-Negative.
-Negative?

32:00.418 --> 32:01.878
You were right behind him.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.588
"He ditched the tracker."

32:05.131 --> 32:07.634
I think he ditched it.
Scared they were gonna find it on him.

32:07.717 --> 32:08.551
What?

32:08.635 --> 32:11.387
You have a visual.
Yellow truck headed south.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.766
He's in the yellow truck headed south.
Assistance required.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.559
Copy. Follow that truck.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.562
-Tuck and roll.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.360
You said, "Phase two." What is phase two?

32:25.443 --> 32:29.739
The man you met in the cabin,
Mr. Coughlin, had a partner, Mr. Green.

32:29.822 --> 32:32.033
Mr. Coughlin had half
of what the colonel needed.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.035
Mr. Green has the other half.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.995
You will bring him to the Colonel.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.081
Without both, each are useless.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.709
Davis, are you getting this?

32:43.920 --> 32:46.047
Something is wrong.
Pull that truck over right now.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.800
Visual on the truck.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.516
I'm sorry, but where are we going?

32:56.599 --> 32:58.101
You're going to Puerto Rico.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.147
Okay. All right.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.565
-Step to the hood!
-Get out!

33:04.649 --> 33:07.151
-Move!
-Get out of the car now!

33:08.277 --> 33:09.988
It's not him. He's gone.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.656
How did we just lose him?

33:22.709 --> 33:24.335
I thought that we were going commercial.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.587
I don't know why
I thought I heard you say Delta.

33:28.297 --> 33:29.382
Time to go.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.985
-What… What is this? This is a--

33:54.073 --> 33:55.742
Oh, that's a big trunk.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.077
Somebody popped the trunk on this one.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.922
Y'all don't do a lot of talking, huh?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.008
My type of people.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.093
I don't like to talk either.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.263
Especially in the air.
What is there to talk about?

34:17.346 --> 34:18.514
Nothing.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.932
Shit. Messed up.

34:21.559 --> 34:22.560
Weapon down.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.021
No.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.566
And it's not about you guys.
We're on the same team.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.610
It's about whoever this is.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.780
This man is an imposter.

34:33.863 --> 34:35.948
Objection. I mean, no. Stop.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.241
I'm interrupting that.

34:37.325 --> 34:41.120
'Cause those are… those are…
those are allegations with no ground.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.289
You're an imposter, and cut it out.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.418
-I need to speak to the client.
-I need to speak to the client too.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.879
Are you just gonna
parrot everything I say?

34:49.962 --> 34:52.465
Are you just gonna
parrot everything I say?

34:53.633 --> 34:55.593
I'm surprised at you gentlemen.

34:55.676 --> 35:01.349
That you could actually believe
that this whiny little mosquito

35:01.432 --> 35:03.976
is actually the Man from Toronto.

35:04.060 --> 35:04.894
Gentlemen.

35:05.686 --> 35:09.065
Trust me. I'm the Man from Toronto.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.901
And I don't know where you're from either,

35:11.984 --> 35:15.905
but I know that I come from a frozen lake
50 miles from nowhere.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.282
Are you stealing my origin story?

35:18.783 --> 35:20.827
Here's a little secret of mine.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.955
I love 19th-century American poetry.

35:24.455 --> 35:25.456
It's my hobby.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.250
Let's hear some Keats.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.752
You wanna hear
her old stuff or her new stuff?

35:29.836 --> 35:31.170
Well, he…

35:31.754 --> 35:33.297
died at 25.

35:33.923 --> 35:37.218
You got some sack on you
to come up here without gender etiquette.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.847
He may not identify as a "he" anymore.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.932
It's all about being gender-neutral.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.851
Obviously, you didn't get the message.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.854
What's your deal?
You don't know who you're offending.

35:47.937 --> 35:51.315
Now you okay?
Is anybody offended? Are you offended?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.818
If so, this is the time to speak up.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.446
You owe a gender-neutral apology
right now.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.533
I apologize, gentle… people.

36:00.616 --> 36:01.534
Hmm.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.746
I don't have to do what you tell me to do!
You ain't the boss of me.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.748
What you need to do is put your weapon up.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.500
There is some sense in that.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.462
I mean, let's face it,
we don't need to discharge a firearm

36:14.088 --> 36:15.423
at 30,000 feet.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.592
That's not gonna benefit anybody.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.804
You're damn right it's not.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.475
Who's the Man from Toronto now?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.187
Him.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.813
This is on you.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.567
No! Wait! Wait! Wait! Ah!

36:35.443 --> 36:37.528
-Don't shoot me. Shoot him!
-Get off!

36:39.238 --> 36:40.865
Get the bald guy! Hit him!

36:40.948 --> 36:41.866
Hit him!

36:43.576 --> 36:44.744
Shoot him.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.331
Oh God.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.292
Oh, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop!

36:53.711 --> 36:55.004
Hey!

36:57.048 --> 36:58.299
-Oh shit!

37:00.384 --> 37:02.053
Warning. Warning. Caution.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.142
-Why are we going up?
-No! No! No!

37:11.562 --> 37:14.023
Get off me!
Can't we do this without violence?

37:16.442 --> 37:18.444
Who the hell is flying the plane?

37:18.527 --> 37:19.737
Get off!

37:22.573 --> 37:23.866
My ass! Oh!

37:25.284 --> 37:27.078
No, no. Don't shoot me. Shoot him.

37:27.745 --> 37:28.788
Shoot him.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.081
-No, don't shoot--

37:31.791 --> 37:33.459
Ah!

37:33.542 --> 37:34.752
Stall. Stall.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.302
Warning.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.428
Breathe, Teddy.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.402
Don't pull that lever!

37:59.485 --> 38:01.821
-What?
-Don't lever!

38:01.904 --> 38:02.780
What?

38:05.324 --> 38:06.909
I can't hold on!

38:24.260 --> 38:25.594
I'm flying out!

38:28.347 --> 38:29.849
Help me, I'm about to die!

38:33.352 --> 38:34.395
Grab my ass!

38:36.981 --> 38:37.815
Please, man!

38:39.275 --> 38:41.652
Oh, for the love of God, we almost died.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.696
Oh, I almost died!

38:43.779 --> 38:44.655
Hey.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.827
Never, ever lever!

38:51.412 --> 38:52.330
Oh.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.126
Terrain, caution. Terrain, caution.

38:58.919 --> 39:03.174
Terrain, caution.
Terrain, caution. Terrain, caution.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.219
Too low. Pull up.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.514
Two hundred feet.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.558
One hundred seventy-five feet.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.936
-One hundred fifty feet.

39:19.315 --> 39:20.900
Seventy-five feet.

39:20.983 --> 39:22.360
Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.706
Autopilot engaged.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.338
Uh…

39:42.421 --> 39:43.881
Excuse me, you got a sec?

39:44.465 --> 39:48.552
I'm sorry for rootin' against you.
I mean, you were a clear favorite, so…

39:49.053 --> 39:50.262
Who do you work for?

39:51.514 --> 39:52.681
Marty's Fitness.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.102
I work for Marty. I'm… I work in sales.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.187
What were you doing in that cabin?

39:59.480 --> 40:02.233
It was a low toner situation.
I thought that I had--

40:07.321 --> 40:08.155
Answer me.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.408
You got my neck.
I can't say nothing.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.163
It's my lady's birthday weekend.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.707
I was taking her to a cabin, all right?

40:18.791 --> 40:23.129
And we get up there to the cabin,
but the address… address was blurry.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.339
The guys at the cabin,
they thought I was you.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.800
-It's a mistake, man!
-You're the mistake.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.593
This is a full-on pigfuck.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.679
I don't know what that means.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.264
Where's this plane headed?

40:33.347 --> 40:35.516
Puerto Rico because
we're in a second phase.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.226
Sit down.

40:37.893 --> 40:38.727
I'm here.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.062
Done.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.398
Why Puerto Rico?

40:42.481 --> 40:44.275
Some guy named Green is there.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.112
-What are you doing?

40:48.195 --> 40:49.488
FBI tracker?

40:50.489 --> 40:51.740
Let me see your phone.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.578
-But I gotta call my wife. I gotta--
-Yeah, good. Good.

40:55.661 --> 40:56.662
I gotta call her.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.040
I gotta call… I gotta call my wife. Don't…

41:01.041 --> 41:02.710
How do you think I found you?

41:03.461 --> 41:06.797
Right now, my priority
is getting back to my wife.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.383
My wife has a birthday dinner.- 00 p.m.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.802
-You're lying.
-Why would I lie about dinner?

41:11.886 --> 41:13.304
No, about having a wife.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.222
I saw your YouTube video.

41:15.306 --> 41:20.269
Nobody who teaches non-contact boxing
could possibly hold down a marriage.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.105
I mean, you ever
actually punched a guy in the face?

41:24.231 --> 41:26.734
There was a time
where I was in a situation

41:26.817 --> 41:28.527
where somebody grabbed my backpack.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.821
And I turned around,
without knowing who it was,

41:30.905 --> 41:32.323
hit her in the face.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.407
Uh…

41:33.491 --> 41:35.409
Of course we were younger, so she cried.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.495
And that's when the principal came.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.288
What are we talking about right now?

41:39.371 --> 41:41.707
My marriage… Matter of fact, no, my life…

41:41.790 --> 41:44.168
My life is depending on it,
do you understand that?

41:44.251 --> 41:45.794
Your life depends on this.

41:45.878 --> 41:46.795
News flash!

41:46.879 --> 41:49.340
I'm more afraid of Lori than I am of you!

41:49.423 --> 41:52.468
-Would she torture you?
-With the silent treatment, yeah.

41:54.553 --> 41:56.931
Do me a favor.
Give me a little silent treatment

41:57.014 --> 41:58.599
for the rest of the journey.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.227
What you just did was mean.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.565
Hey, this is Teddy. I'll call you back.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.485
Hi, my little avocado.

42:09.568 --> 42:12.696
Oh, honey, I am having
the greatest birthday ever, okay?

42:12.780 --> 42:14.240
Oh, and guess what?

42:14.323 --> 42:17.243
-Annie's in town.
-Uh, hey, Teddy.

42:17.326 --> 42:19.161
Okay, don't freak out, don't panic.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.413
I won't say anything rude
or sarcastic for once.

42:21.497 --> 42:25.167
Teddy, honey, I've never said this
in all the years I've known you, but wow.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.836
I mean, well done. You didn't Teddy it.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.047
This makes up for years
of disappointment--

42:30.130 --> 42:33.717
Okay. Honey, listen,
I know you made a reservation for us,

42:33.842 --> 42:35.886
but Annie can get us
into this amazing place.

42:35.970 --> 42:36.929
Oh, yeah, tell him.

42:37.012 --> 42:39.557
There's supposed to be food,
dancing, just a whole experience.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.351
It's called L'Ambassadeur.
It's French. He won't understand.

42:42.434 --> 42:45.980
So I hope that doesn't
mess up your plans too much.

42:46.063 --> 42:48.107
-I'm excited. See you there.
-Oh, champagne!

42:48.190 --> 42:50.192
-Bye, love you.
-Do you have glasses? Whoo!

42:59.952 --> 43:03.122
I just want you to know
you killed six people on this plane.

43:03.205 --> 43:06.250
And the fact this isn't
a big deal to you, it baffles me.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.460
It makes you a sick individual in my eyes.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.671
-It's a dog-eat-dog world.

43:10.754 --> 43:11.964
What does that mean?

43:12.047 --> 43:14.174
What does that mean
outside of being untrue?

43:14.258 --> 43:15.718
Dogs don't eat other dogs.

43:15.801 --> 43:17.303
So it can't be a dog-eat-dog world.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.597
Naturally, a dog will sniff
another dog's butt.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.016
He may lick some poop occasionally.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.976
But he won't eat another dog.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.603
Dogs don't eat other dogs.

43:26.478 --> 43:30.316
Well, you're talking about
domesticated, well-fed pets.

43:31.650 --> 43:33.944
I'm talking about a hungry dog.

43:34.028 --> 43:37.197
I mean, a dog that ain't afraid anymore.

43:37.698 --> 43:38.949
-Mad dog.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.994
Okay, A, I've seen those dogs.
I see one every day.

43:42.077 --> 43:44.496
My next-door neighbor's dog,
Stephanie, is one of those.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.832
Let's talk about
what else I'm looking at. Dead people.

43:46.915 --> 43:50.336
One, two, three, four. There were six!

43:50.419 --> 43:53.589
Two of them fell out the back,
40,000 feet to their death!

43:53.672 --> 43:56.258
You're responsible for that.
And you dropped your lighter.

43:56.342 --> 43:57.593
You dropped this, okay?

43:57.676 --> 44:00.137
And now we got water
springing out the damn plane.

44:00.220 --> 44:01.972
It smells like gas.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.724
It smells like gas! Gas!

44:06.226 --> 44:07.770
-Hey!
-Yeah?

44:07.853 --> 44:11.065
Talk to me, Toronto.
What the hell is going on?

44:11.148 --> 44:12.941
-I made contact.
-Hey. Wait a second.

44:13.025 --> 44:16.779
-And who was it? He's just a rogue asset?
-Where are we? There ain't no airports…

44:16.862 --> 44:23.160
Ready for this? His name is Teddy Jackson,
and he actually uses that Hotmail account.

44:23.243 --> 44:25.496
-Did you let him live?
-Temporarily.

44:25.579 --> 44:29.625
-Do I have another Minnesota situation?
-Relax, the client thinks he's me.

44:29.708 --> 44:30.793
-I have no choice.
-Hey!

44:30.876 --> 44:34.421
-I don't pay you to let people live.
-Make an exception.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.716
We gotta find a Mr. Green
and deliver him to Marín back in DC.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.510
-Where are you now?
-Puerto Rico.

44:39.593 --> 44:43.347
Jesus. You better get
a handle on this, Toronto, right now.

44:43.430 --> 44:45.474
Hey! You don't hear me calling you?

44:46.058 --> 44:48.977
Who are you talking to? Debora?
Is that Mrs. Toronto?

44:49.061 --> 44:50.437
My handler.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.941
Take a second and tell me
the things I need to understand.

44:54.024 --> 44:56.110
What is my part in the mission?

44:56.193 --> 44:57.361
Two parts, actually.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.570
Thank you.

44:58.654 --> 44:59.530
First part is

44:59.613 --> 45:00.823
shut up.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.950
Or I'll kill you.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.077
Second part is

45:05.661 --> 45:07.705
don't forget the first part.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.873
So you didn't hear nothing I said?

45:09.957 --> 45:11.083
So everything I--

45:13.001 --> 45:14.837
Hey! No!

45:15.337 --> 45:16.171
Hey!

45:16.255 --> 45:17.172
Shit.

45:18.590 --> 45:21.135
Hey, we just blew up a plane, man.

45:21.927 --> 45:23.429
I blew up a plane, man.

45:23.512 --> 45:24.847
You didn't do shit.

45:35.399 --> 45:38.193
That's why you gotta get on things quick
when the market's bearish.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.737
-Excuse me.

45:41.739 --> 45:44.992
-You boys mind if I join?
-Are you even a member here?

45:45.075 --> 45:49.037
Why, yes. I'm the Man from Miami.
I'm a guest of Philip Beaumont.

45:49.121 --> 45:49.997
Oh, well.

45:50.748 --> 45:51.957
I'm Philip Beaumont.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.460
-Oh, you are?
-Imagine that.

45:55.127 --> 45:57.337
Yeah.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.131
Thank you.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.260
You're crazy.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.598
You're crazy. You're crazy.

46:12.519 --> 46:14.855
-Hello.
-I have a job. Where are you?

46:15.355 --> 46:17.357
-I’m on the course.
-Well, pack your bags.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.193
You're going to Puerto Rico.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.277
Puerto Rico.

46:21.278 --> 46:22.863
-What's the offer?
-Two million.

46:22.946 --> 46:26.533
Bring the asset to the client,
and you'll get a big payday.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.044
According to Luis's note,

46:37.127 --> 46:41.965
you are to collect Green
at a tech company event, so…

46:42.716 --> 46:43.759
we got an hour

46:44.551 --> 46:45.552
to get you ready.

46:46.386 --> 46:47.554
Get me ready for what?

46:47.638 --> 46:48.722
To be me.

46:50.849 --> 46:52.851
What are you talking about?
To be you? What?

46:52.935 --> 46:54.937
Unfortunately,
they don't have kids' sizes.

46:58.690 --> 46:59.525
What do you think?

46:59.608 --> 47:01.860
You need to look
like you've done this before.

47:02.444 --> 47:03.654
What do I look like now?

47:04.238 --> 47:06.865
Like a guy who teaches non-contact boxing.

47:07.574 --> 47:11.036
Paring, boning, and this.

47:11.119 --> 47:14.414
I mean, it ain't Shirogami,
but it's as close as we're gonna come.

47:16.959 --> 47:20.128
Do you have any idea
how big non-contact boxing is?

47:20.212 --> 47:21.255
Look at this.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.341
Right cross. Right cross.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.386
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

47:27.886 --> 47:28.929
Just from that.

47:29.513 --> 47:34.059
Never box at me again
without actually punching me in the face.

47:34.893 --> 47:37.521
They got Hot Hot Cheese Puffs.
I gotta get these.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.774
No. We ain't getting that crap.

47:41.358 --> 47:42.860
We didn't ask for 'em.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.862
I asked for 'em. We are getting these.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.613
Get off. Stop pushing me.

47:48.031 --> 47:48.907
Shit.

47:50.409 --> 47:51.326
Hmm.

47:51.410 --> 47:53.787
What's that,
for your little serial killer wall?

47:53.871 --> 47:55.414
You think you'd make the wall?

47:55.497 --> 47:58.000
Come on, man.
You're barely fridge material.

47:59.167 --> 48:00.794
-Hop on.
-What?

48:01.712 --> 48:02.546
Hop on.

48:06.049 --> 48:07.134
Hold on.

48:07.217 --> 48:08.176
Oh God.

48:10.137 --> 48:13.098
Let me put this here
and get a good grab on you.

48:13.599 --> 48:15.058
All right, I'm ready.

48:15.142 --> 48:16.226
There's handles.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.185
Huh?

48:17.269 --> 48:18.520
There's handles.

48:20.272 --> 48:21.690
Why didn't you just say that?

48:21.773 --> 48:24.151
Why not say, "Grab the handles behind you"
from the beginning?

48:24.902 --> 48:25.736
That simple.

48:37.581 --> 48:41.209
So you're telling me
this is some type of tech company event?

48:41.293 --> 48:42.127
Yeah.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.837
My mouth is burning.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.964
Sure you don't want any
of these Hot Hot Cheese Puffs?

48:46.048 --> 48:47.215
Put that garbage away, man.

48:47.299 --> 48:50.802
What you mean garbage? It's good.
I'm trying to be nice and give you some.

48:53.221 --> 48:54.556
What's the matter with you?

48:55.599 --> 48:58.644
All I had to do was change the damn toner
and I wouldn't be in none of this.

48:58.727 --> 49:02.981
Yeah, but you didn't put the toner
in the printer, and you're here now, yeah?

49:03.482 --> 49:05.484
Stop living in your imagination.

49:05.567 --> 49:08.153
-That's for Mr. Green to do.
-You don't think I know that?

49:08.236 --> 49:11.573
Let's not skip the fact that
I'm now here carrying out a mission

49:11.657 --> 49:13.492
that I'm not capable of doing.

49:13.575 --> 49:17.079
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna give him your scariest look,

49:17.162 --> 49:18.830
and you're gonna complete the mission,

49:18.914 --> 49:20.999
or you have no idea
what I'm gonna do to you.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.294
My bad.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.338
I got it. I got it.

49:26.421 --> 49:27.839
So whatever you were gonna do,

49:28.632 --> 49:30.258
you don't have to do to me.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.470
I wasn't gonna do anything.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.555
It's just a look.

49:35.639 --> 49:36.890
It's all a bluff.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.600
-Yeah?
-You got it?

49:38.684 --> 49:39.518
Yeah.

49:39.601 --> 49:41.478
Here. Thank you, man.

49:43.188 --> 49:46.775
-I didn't want you to do it.
-Don't ever touch me like that again.

49:53.657 --> 49:56.284
A102 conference room.

49:56.368 --> 49:57.202
You got this.

49:59.830 --> 50:00.872
Game face.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.376
Not shit face.

50:04.459 --> 50:05.460
Game face.

50:06.461 --> 50:08.130
Go on. Right down there.

50:09.506 --> 50:10.549
Relax, will you?

50:10.632 --> 50:12.718
I'm gonna be with you.
I'm gonna be listening.

50:25.981 --> 50:28.859
There's a guy
standing outside the door.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.485
Yeah, so?

50:31.945 --> 50:32.863
He's got a gun.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.407
Yeah, well, he would.

50:40.996 --> 50:43.498
"O the bleeding drops of red."

50:44.041 --> 50:46.543
"Where on the deck my captain lies."

50:46.626 --> 50:48.378
"Fallen cold and dead."

50:50.797 --> 50:53.258
The Man from Toronto.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.428
Really looking forward to seeing you
go to work on this crowd.

50:57.220 --> 50:58.055
Crowd?

50:59.347 --> 51:01.016
One of these guys is Green.

51:01.099 --> 51:04.061
We just don't know who.
Which is where you come in.

51:04.561 --> 51:07.064
Marín never dealt with Green face-to-face,

51:07.147 --> 51:09.816
but we traced him
to the R&D department here.

51:10.567 --> 51:12.527
Is this the entire R&D team?

51:13.195 --> 51:15.197
-Yup.
-Shit.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.949
We need you to figure out
which one is the real Green.

51:18.033 --> 51:22.162
Take him to the Colonel back in DC
at his hotel by- 00 p.m. tonight.

51:22.245 --> 51:23.413
Here's the address.

51:34.174 --> 51:35.175
I'm…

51:35.258 --> 51:36.134
I'm scared.

51:37.427 --> 51:41.973
-I can't do it. I don't think I can do it.
-You can do this. And you will.

51:53.318 --> 51:57.197
I got an address, but I don't have
all the information I need.

51:58.031 --> 52:00.992
One time, one time only. Who is Green?

52:02.577 --> 52:07.124
Do you guys have any idea
who you're dealing with?

52:07.207 --> 52:09.209
The Man from Toronto!

52:09.709 --> 52:10.669
Shit.

52:10.752 --> 52:13.004
-Let me do my thing.
-Sorry.

52:13.505 --> 52:15.465
I do have a reputation.

52:15.549 --> 52:17.134
Show 'em what you brought.

52:18.009 --> 52:20.053
I got ways of getting my answers.

52:23.056 --> 52:24.099
And I'll get them.

52:24.182 --> 52:25.475
See, the--

52:26.768 --> 52:28.145
You dropped the knives?

52:29.980 --> 52:31.356
You want some help with that?

52:31.439 --> 52:33.942
Questions.
You're asking the questions.

52:34.025 --> 52:36.069
Are you familiar with reverse psychology?

52:36.903 --> 52:38.572
-No.
-That's right. The answer's no.

52:38.655 --> 52:41.116
If you did know
the tactic that I just employed,

52:41.199 --> 52:44.119
dropping my utensils on the floor,
making me seem incompetent,

52:44.202 --> 52:46.997
it was all just a ploy
to get into their heads.

52:47.581 --> 52:48.915
Mind games.

52:49.583 --> 52:51.001
And I got a lot of them.

52:51.710 --> 52:54.087
Mixing stuff up is what I love to do.

52:54.754 --> 52:57.299
Question is,
who am I gonna do it to first?

52:57.382 --> 52:59.968
Eyes. Look him in the eyes.

53:07.893 --> 53:10.562
Come on. I can't do this.

53:10.645 --> 53:13.356
We can't afford for you to Teddy this one.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.484
Get up from under that table.
Wave the knives around.

53:16.568 --> 53:17.861
Don't be a wuss.

53:18.904 --> 53:20.864
-Guess who's back.

53:27.412 --> 53:28.246
Me.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.123
That's who.

53:32.000 --> 53:32.918
Own it.

53:33.668 --> 53:34.586
Oh…

53:36.504 --> 53:40.050
-You know what this is?
-Some kind of disemboweler.

53:41.134 --> 53:43.678
Some kind of disemboweler.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.847
'Cause I don't like bowels.

53:45.931 --> 53:46.890
How about you?

53:47.724 --> 53:48.725
I… I don't know.

53:48.808 --> 53:51.102
Looks like
there's gonna be some human ass

53:51.186 --> 53:53.355
on a hibachi grill tonight at Teddyhanas.

53:53.438 --> 53:56.733
-I knew this wasn't gonna work.
-What do you want me to do with this?

53:56.816 --> 54:00.779
-Hmm? I'll do this all over your face.
-Please, please, I'm not Green.

54:00.862 --> 54:02.197
-You're not Green?
-I'm not Green.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.573
He say he not Green.

54:04.157 --> 54:05.533
That's what he says.

54:06.159 --> 54:08.078
It don't make sense to me!

54:08.161 --> 54:10.288
It don't make sense!

54:11.456 --> 54:13.667
-If you're not Green, then who is?
-Ah!

54:14.251 --> 54:16.211
Ah! Oh, my eye!

54:16.294 --> 54:18.421
-Oh shit.
-Oh, what?

54:18.505 --> 54:19.506
What?

54:19.589 --> 54:22.050
-You didn't actually cut his eye, did you?
-I can't see.

54:22.133 --> 54:23.802
-You can see.
-I can't see!

54:23.885 --> 54:24.886
-You can see.
-I can't see!

54:24.970 --> 54:26.930
You're looking at me,
so I know you can see.

54:27.013 --> 54:31.643
Shut up! If I hear another peep,
I'm gonna get the bigger knife.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.896
You got a little bit
of blood on your damn face.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.064
Open your eye.

54:41.861 --> 54:43.280
Swallow it.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.701
Jesus Christ.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.875
You are a train wreck.

54:56.793 --> 54:58.295
Oh God!

54:59.170 --> 55:00.505
Stop.

55:01.548 --> 55:04.092
-I’m Green! I’m Green! Please, stop.
-Oh God.

55:04.175 --> 55:05.218
I'm Green.

55:05.719 --> 55:07.846
That's Green. He's Green.

55:07.929 --> 55:10.348
I heard you were the best, but wow!

55:11.933 --> 55:14.561
Yeah, just doing what I do. Right?

55:16.021 --> 55:17.147
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

55:18.064 --> 55:20.900
-What you doing, man?
-We can't just put them back, can we?

55:20.984 --> 55:23.236
No. No, no, no. No, no. Listen.

55:23.945 --> 55:26.197
Now, first of all, I wanna apologize,

55:26.990 --> 55:30.744
because I know my breath doesn’t
smell the best after what I just did.

55:30.827 --> 55:33.288
Now, this ain't the solution.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.584
-No, we can't do it like this.
-What the hell? What is that?

55:37.667 --> 55:38.501
What's what?

55:38.585 --> 55:39.711
In your ear.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.172
Are you wearing a wire?

55:42.922 --> 55:43.757
Stop!

55:43.840 --> 55:47.135
I can't hear on this side!
It's a hearing aid.

55:47.218 --> 55:49.679
-Who the hell are you talking to?
-Me.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.071
-Did you land yet?
-I'm on the ground.

56:06.154 --> 56:08.615
-Good.
-I'll call you as soon as I intercept.

56:10.450 --> 56:13.078
They're paying me to deliver you to Marín.

56:13.953 --> 56:15.372
I wonder why that is.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.750
Are you familiar with DARPA?

56:18.833 --> 56:20.418
-Obviously.
-I am.

56:21.044 --> 56:22.087
Had it two times.

56:22.587 --> 56:25.715
Once in the back of my neck,
one time on the back of my knees.

56:26.216 --> 56:27.300
DARPA,

56:27.384 --> 56:31.429
the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

56:31.513 --> 56:33.598
That's not what I had. I had a ringworm.

56:34.599 --> 56:37.143
Coughlin and I worked there
in the early 2000s

56:37.227 --> 56:40.313
developing seismic explosives,
untraceable.

56:40.397 --> 56:43.691
Makes the blast
look like a subterranean tremor.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.026
Mm.

56:45.110 --> 56:48.571
Two years ago, our former boss
called General Hanson,

56:49.906 --> 56:52.659
he asked for help
with a top-secret project

56:52.742 --> 56:53.868
for an unnamed client.

56:53.952 --> 56:56.121
I didn't get many of the details.

56:56.663 --> 57:00.291
We didn't know
Hanson had been hired by Marín.

57:01.376 --> 57:02.335
What for?

57:02.877 --> 57:06.381
Blowing up the Venezuelan Embassy
in Washington.

57:07.090 --> 57:11.428
When we realized what he was planning,
we built in two fail-safes.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.097
The remote detonator to the explosive,

57:14.973 --> 57:17.809
it needs both Coughlin's coded sequence

57:18.393 --> 57:19.811
and my thumbprint.

57:20.979 --> 57:22.981
So they're after your thumbprint.

57:26.151 --> 57:28.736
You know, we won't deliver you to Marín.

57:29.362 --> 57:30.655
Of course we're not.

57:30.738 --> 57:35.034
You sat here, you let all these people go,
now you're about to do the same for him?

57:35.618 --> 57:37.120
People can change.

57:37.203 --> 57:39.622
-I'm proud of you, man.
-Thank you.

57:40.206 --> 57:42.459
I think you might
wanna step out for a second.

57:43.042 --> 57:45.962
Oh. You guys are about to chat.
I'll go give you guys a second.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.673
I'll be back, man.
I'm really proud of you.

57:48.756 --> 57:50.884
-Awesome.
-Okay. Dope.

57:52.010 --> 57:54.220
People do change.

57:55.513 --> 57:57.515
Don't… What are you doing?
Don't do that to…

57:57.599 --> 57:59.434
No, no, no, no. Please don't do that!

57:59.517 --> 58:01.352
-Oh my God!

58:04.981 --> 58:06.566
-Look at that.
-Cheese bag.

58:07.901 --> 58:08.860
Cheese bag.

58:10.737 --> 58:11.654
Open it up.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.537
Last pat.

58:24.209 --> 58:25.293
Hey.

58:25.376 --> 58:26.419
Here.

58:26.503 --> 58:27.754
Take this, man.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.380
You don't need me anymore.

58:29.464 --> 58:32.759
Actually, I do need you
to deliver the thumb.

58:33.259 --> 58:34.928
No. Did you hear what he said back there?

58:35.011 --> 58:37.680
You're gonna have to kill me
to get me to do anything like that.

58:37.764 --> 58:39.724
It's not happening. Do you hear?

58:39.807 --> 58:41.559
What are you doing? What are you doing?

58:41.643 --> 58:45.438
It's not me you need to worry about.
They have your photo.

58:45.522 --> 58:47.232
They know who you are.

58:47.315 --> 58:49.192
You have no choice.

58:49.776 --> 58:53.112
I do have a choice.
And I choose not to be you anymore.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.197
I'm done.

58:54.739 --> 58:56.115
Watch out!

58:58.284 --> 58:59.911
Who are you?

59:18.805 --> 59:20.181
Help!

59:20.265 --> 59:22.392
I'm gonna die, man!

59:22.475 --> 59:23.351
Oh God!

59:23.434 --> 59:24.894
Oh my God!

59:24.978 --> 59:26.104
Hold on!

59:29.524 --> 59:30.942
I'm high.

59:31.025 --> 59:33.152
Ah! I'm slipping!

59:41.369 --> 59:43.329
-You with me, Teddy?
-Help me, man!

59:49.377 --> 59:50.420
I'm slipping!

59:50.503 --> 59:51.671
I can't hold on!

59:54.716 --> 59:55.925
-Oh!

59:57.093 --> 59:58.386
-Shit!
-Ah!

1:00:01.931 --> 1:00:03.391
Oh my God. Oh.

1:00:03.474 --> 1:00:04.559
I see the thumb!

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:06.978
-I see it!
-Grab it!

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:08.605
Okay. Okay.

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:12.984
I'm gonna get it. I'm about to get it.
I'm about to get it now.

1:00:13.067 --> 1:00:14.319
I got it!

1:00:15.862 --> 1:00:18.281
He's shootin' at me!
I'm getting light-headed!

1:00:18.364 --> 1:00:20.825
You are experiencing
a lack of oxygen to the brain.

1:00:20.908 --> 1:00:23.286
Will you stop diagnosing me
and just kill the guy!

1:00:23.369 --> 1:00:25.705
-Kill him right now. Shit!

1:00:25.788 --> 1:00:26.623
Shoot him!

1:00:29.292 --> 1:00:31.085
Ow, you shot me in the ass!

1:00:31.169 --> 1:00:32.795
Your ass got in my way.

1:00:32.879 --> 1:00:34.005
I'm slipping!

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:39.552
-Hold on. I'm coming down.
-Help.

1:00:40.553 --> 1:00:41.554
Help me, man.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.139
Help me. I'm about to die!

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:49.020
-Throw me the bag.
-No! No! I'll fall again.

1:00:49.103 --> 1:00:50.647
Toss it. I believe in you.

1:00:56.569 --> 1:00:58.154
-Really?
-I just got shot in the ass!

1:00:58.237 --> 1:00:59.656
-I didn't want to fall!

1:00:59.739 --> 1:01:01.240
Oh, help!

1:01:01.324 --> 1:01:03.326
-I'm gonna die, man!
-Aw, damn it.

1:01:04.285 --> 1:01:05.286
Help me!

1:01:06.412 --> 1:01:07.497
Help!

1:01:10.750 --> 1:01:13.169
Help! Come on, man,
don't leave me up here!

1:01:28.768 --> 1:01:30.269
You're outgunned.

1:01:33.231 --> 1:01:34.816
Come on, come on, put the guns down!

1:01:41.197 --> 1:01:42.949
Ow!

1:01:44.033 --> 1:01:45.493
Ow, man!

1:01:45.576 --> 1:01:47.078
Oh, would you relax?

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:49.497
My God. You just got grazed.

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:52.333
I didn't get no grazed.
You shot me in the ass.

1:01:52.417 --> 1:01:54.043
You're such a baby.

1:01:54.877 --> 1:01:59.841
You know, I’m surprised how taut
this non-contact makes the buns.

1:02:00.758 --> 1:02:02.719
I told you, man, it's all cardio.

1:02:02.802 --> 1:02:05.263
It's about giving your body
the best chance to succeed.

1:02:05.346 --> 1:02:07.598
I got a good look at you.
You got some nice ones too.

1:02:21.362 --> 1:02:22.363
Yeah?

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:23.906
Tell me it's done.

1:02:23.990 --> 1:02:26.075
Got ambushed. Barely made it out.

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:28.703
-You heard from Marín?
-Have I heard from Marín?

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:31.247
No. Who ambushed you?

1:02:31.330 --> 1:02:34.375
-Could you ID him? Did you see his face?
-No idea.

1:02:35.918 --> 1:02:37.670
Definitely a professional.

1:02:37.754 --> 1:02:39.714
Where are you with phase two?

1:02:40.423 --> 1:02:43.092
Well, we got all we need of Green.

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:46.429
Heading back to DC
for the handoff to Marín.

1:02:46.512 --> 1:02:47.555
That'll be at, uh…

1:02:49.307 --> 1:02:51.684
- 00 p.m. tonight, at the Monarch.

1:02:54.687 --> 1:02:55.813
Did you hear that?

1:02:58.649 --> 1:02:59.817
Heard what?

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:02.904
Your handler just lied to you.

1:03:02.987 --> 1:03:04.405
What are you talking about?

1:03:04.489 --> 1:03:08.951
Talking about her repeating the question.
That's a clear sign of stalling and lying.

1:03:09.035 --> 1:03:10.411
I used to do it all the time.

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:12.622
Did it this morning
when I was talking to Lori.

1:03:12.705 --> 1:03:16.709
I've been in sales for ten years.
I know that move.

1:03:16.793 --> 1:03:19.128
Yeah, well, I've known her for 20.

1:03:19.712 --> 1:03:21.881
-Have you ever seen her in person?
-No.

1:03:23.132 --> 1:03:24.091
We're leaving.

1:03:24.759 --> 1:03:25.593
What is this?

1:03:26.385 --> 1:03:28.262
Passport. You're gonna need it.

1:03:30.097 --> 1:03:32.767
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

1:03:32.850 --> 1:03:36.479
We have a flight time
to Washington, DC of three hours.

1:03:36.562 --> 1:03:38.105
You know, I saw your file.

1:03:39.524 --> 1:03:40.358
I did.

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:43.653
I know about the bear
and your grandfather,

1:03:43.736 --> 1:03:46.155
and I just wanna say,
I wanna say that that's tough.

1:03:46.656 --> 1:03:49.242
No child should have to
go through that, ever. It's a lot.

1:03:49.325 --> 1:03:51.828
You don't know what you're talking about.

1:03:52.328 --> 1:03:53.496
I know that Debora…

1:03:54.247 --> 1:03:56.958
Debora wouldn't want this. She wouldn't.

1:03:57.041 --> 1:03:58.376
You think you know me?

1:03:59.168 --> 1:04:00.086
I know you.

1:04:01.128 --> 1:04:04.340
I looked at
your little online gym channel.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.217
Seven views.

1:04:07.093 --> 1:04:09.929
With one upload three years ago.

1:04:10.972 --> 1:04:12.265
And seven views.

1:04:12.348 --> 1:04:13.641
Yeah. Three comments.

1:04:14.892 --> 1:04:15.726
Yeah.

1:04:16.727 --> 1:04:20.439
You think that low toner
got you into this situation?

1:04:21.107 --> 1:04:21.941
No.

1:04:22.483 --> 1:04:27.446
Never doing what you say you're gonna do
is what got you into this situation.

1:04:29.323 --> 1:04:30.491
Being afraid.

1:04:31.909 --> 1:04:34.453
Not being able to follow through.

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:35.997
Not having the guts.

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:38.457
You know? You literally fight air.

1:04:38.541 --> 1:04:41.586
The only thing you ever landed
was that poor woman

1:04:43.004 --> 1:04:44.672
who calls herself your wife.

1:04:45.256 --> 1:04:48.175
And I get the feeling
you're about to Teddy that.

1:04:53.681 --> 1:04:55.308
You know what, man? You're right.

1:04:57.768 --> 1:05:01.022
Just realizing I haven't been
the best husband I could've been.

1:05:02.023 --> 1:05:03.316
Can I use your phone?

1:05:04.692 --> 1:05:06.819
Make it snappy. Keep it on speaker.

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:10.865
Yes.

1:05:12.450 --> 1:05:13.492
Hello?

1:05:13.576 --> 1:05:14.619
Hey, babe.

1:05:14.702 --> 1:05:15.536
Teddy.

1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:16.787
How are you doing?

1:05:16.871 --> 1:05:19.332
Missing you, Mr. Presentation.

1:05:19.957 --> 1:05:20.917
I miss you too.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.211
I just called because
I want you to know that I'm sorry

1:05:24.295 --> 1:05:28.215
for missing your birthday in the past
and Teddying everything. I just--

1:05:28.299 --> 1:05:30.092
Baby, don't worry about it.

1:05:30.176 --> 1:05:31.928
I actually do worry about it.

1:05:32.595 --> 1:05:34.096
Are you sure you're okay?

1:05:34.764 --> 1:05:36.724
Yeah. I'm fine, I promise.

1:05:36.807 --> 1:05:37.808
Okay, then.

1:05:37.892 --> 1:05:38.976
See you tonight.

1:05:39.060 --> 1:05:41.312
-Get off the phone!
-Oh, and I just wanna make sure

1:05:41.395 --> 1:05:43.314
you got my message
about the new reservation.

1:05:43.397 --> 1:05:46.692
-- 00 p.m., L'Ambassadeur.
-L'Ambassadeur, bitch!

1:05:46.776 --> 1:05:50.321
-It's meant to be the most amazing place.
-Yeah. I'll, um--

1:05:51.489 --> 1:05:53.366
What are you doing?
I didn't even say goodbye.

1:05:53.449 --> 1:05:55.159
-Hello? Hello?
-Let's get pre-lit!

1:05:55.242 --> 1:05:57.328
This is an historic moment for Venezuela…

1:05:57.411 --> 1:06:00.623
Well, you can say hello
tonight at the L'Ambassadeur.

1:06:01.916 --> 1:06:04.627
Wait, the drop is supposed
to be at- 00 p.m. You're gonna let me go?

1:06:05.336 --> 1:06:08.381
Oh, uh, yeah.
Not only am I gonna let you go,

1:06:08.464 --> 1:06:10.883
I'm gonna let her know
you're bringing an associate.

1:06:11.550 --> 1:06:12.802
…of ups and downs.

1:06:12.885 --> 1:06:16.222
Today, President Henderson
and President Arvito of Venezuela

1:06:16.305 --> 1:06:18.891
will celebrate the opening
of the new embassy.

1:06:20.726 --> 1:06:23.854
By the way,
I've been waiting to check this place out.

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:26.148
It's got durian sorbet on the menu.

1:06:26.232 --> 1:06:27.733
What the hell is durian?

1:06:28.734 --> 1:06:32.947
Yorktown is entering the restaurant
with an unidentified male. Do you copy?

1:06:33.030 --> 1:06:34.865
-Can we get an ID?
-Negative.

1:06:34.949 --> 1:06:36.909
This could be the Marín meeting.

1:06:37.618 --> 1:06:40.204
L'Ambassadeur security feed
coming up now, ma'am.

1:06:40.913 --> 1:06:43.874
Hey, you wanna hold on to the thumb
or you wanna check it?

1:06:45.710 --> 1:06:48.629
Okay, come here.
Let me talk to you. Please. Please.

1:06:50.381 --> 1:06:53.592
I want you to relax. Okay?

1:06:53.676 --> 1:06:56.971
Listen, you should--
Get your hands off of me like that.

1:06:58.973 --> 1:07:02.143
It's 'cause of the cameras.
Stop with the paranoia stuff.

1:07:02.226 --> 1:07:05.604
Somebody looks you in your eyes
and they smile, smile back.

1:07:05.688 --> 1:07:08.232
Make eye contact. Be a person.

1:07:08.315 --> 1:07:10.860
Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable in this, sir.

1:07:12.403 --> 1:07:15.031
That's not the type
of eye contact I'm talking about.

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:19.952
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

1:07:20.036 --> 1:07:21.287
Oh, no problem.

1:07:22.413 --> 1:07:25.041
I'm just asking that you
make the most out of this, okay?

1:07:27.126 --> 1:07:27.960
How do I look?

1:07:28.753 --> 1:07:29.670
Who's she with?

1:07:31.047 --> 1:07:32.339
Her friend Anne. Why?

1:07:33.007 --> 1:07:35.092
You didn't tell me about Anne.

1:07:35.843 --> 1:07:37.762
I didn't know that
I had to tell you about Anne.

1:07:38.596 --> 1:07:40.014
-What's the problem?

1:07:40.097 --> 1:07:41.724
I get uncomfortable…

1:07:42.808 --> 1:07:43.976
around women.

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:46.562
So, how do you deal with Debora?

1:07:46.645 --> 1:07:51.108
-Debora is different. Debora--
-Stop it. Why are you complicating this?

1:07:51.192 --> 1:07:52.943
-Same as you talking to Debora.
-Okay.

1:07:53.652 --> 1:07:55.821
-Hey.
-Hey! There you go.

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:57.364
-Hello.
-Hi, honey.

1:07:57.448 --> 1:07:58.699
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:07:58.783 --> 1:08:01.786
Oh my God.
I thought I was never gonna see you again.

1:08:02.411 --> 1:08:03.370
Well, here I am.

1:08:04.830 --> 1:08:06.165
Who is this?

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:08.584
This is the Man from…

1:08:09.418 --> 1:08:10.586
Equinox.

1:08:10.669 --> 1:08:12.254
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1:08:12.338 --> 1:08:15.174
-All right, let's sit down.
-Okay, great. Thank you.

1:08:15.257 --> 1:08:16.759
-Let's all sit down.
-Hi, Teddy.

1:08:16.842 --> 1:08:17.676
Hey, Anne!

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:19.470
Who is this guy, Santoro?

1:08:19.553 --> 1:08:21.388
-Does he look like Colonel Marín?
-No, ma'am.

1:08:21.472 --> 1:08:24.141
It must be the Man from Toronto.
This is our chance.

1:08:24.225 --> 1:08:26.769
-Can we get a higher resolution?
-That's a negative.

1:08:27.269 --> 1:08:28.687
Get me another camera.

1:08:28.771 --> 1:08:30.689
When Teddy texted,

1:08:30.773 --> 1:08:33.150
I didn't want
the whole third-wheel dynamic,

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:34.360
so I brought you a date.

1:08:34.443 --> 1:08:36.487
Don't worry. It doesn't have to be a date.

1:08:36.570 --> 1:08:38.280
Anne's my best friend from college.

1:08:38.364 --> 1:08:41.325
It actually could be,
Mr. Tall, Dark and Scary.

1:08:42.326 --> 1:08:43.702
No. No.

1:08:43.786 --> 1:08:44.912
It can't.

1:08:44.995 --> 1:08:48.874
All right, stop, don't even panic.
That's his way of telling you he's taken.

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:50.876
-He's got a lady. Her name's Debora.
-All right.

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:53.462
Well, actually, Debora is a…

1:08:53.546 --> 1:08:57.091
1969 Dodge Charger 440 R/T.

1:08:57.174 --> 1:08:58.801
Come again? What'd you say?

1:08:59.301 --> 1:09:00.344
Debora's a car?

1:09:00.427 --> 1:09:03.514
The 440 R/T is not just a car.

1:09:03.597 --> 1:09:08.894
With eight cylinders of big block,
high torque horsepower,

1:09:09.478 --> 1:09:10.312
it's a weapon.

1:09:10.896 --> 1:09:14.567
-I'm happy celebrating my wife's birthday.
-Yes, my love.

1:09:14.650 --> 1:09:17.153
-Correctly.
-That's right. You look good.

1:09:17.236 --> 1:09:19.113
-And it's a man-size too.
-I love it.

1:09:19.196 --> 1:09:20.656
I got it in, uh…

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:23.325
It's some nice ink over there.

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:25.452
Are you a chef or…

1:09:25.536 --> 1:09:27.580
Oh, well, yeah, I…

1:09:27.663 --> 1:09:29.331
I wanted to be. Yeah.

1:09:29.415 --> 1:09:30.666
It's not too late.

1:09:31.250 --> 1:09:33.919
Well, you know,
I actually thought about that.

1:09:34.003 --> 1:09:38.132
I thought about opening my own place.
A great, great restaurant.

1:09:38.215 --> 1:09:43.012
But then I just remember everything,

1:09:43.095 --> 1:09:45.222
and it just doesn't seem…

1:09:46.765 --> 1:09:48.017
…realistic, you know?

1:09:48.100 --> 1:09:48.934
Really?

1:09:49.435 --> 1:09:50.269
Why not?

1:09:50.811 --> 1:09:51.896
Well, it's just,

1:09:53.063 --> 1:09:53.898
kinda scary.

1:09:53.981 --> 1:09:54.940
I mean, what if…

1:09:55.733 --> 1:09:56.734
nobody came?

1:09:58.527 --> 1:09:59.570
I'd come.

1:10:01.989 --> 1:10:02.948
Really?

1:10:03.616 --> 1:10:05.034
Mm-hmm.

1:10:05.117 --> 1:10:07.203
It's gotta be him.
Do you want me to intercept?

1:10:07.286 --> 1:10:08.370
Wait for backup.

1:10:08.454 --> 1:10:10.039
Davis, where are you?

1:10:10.623 --> 1:10:11.624
Five minutes out.

1:10:13.876 --> 1:10:16.503
I finished that
before everybody.

1:10:16.587 --> 1:10:19.131
Oh, I love this song.
Look, they're dancing.

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:20.174
This is so cute.

1:10:20.799 --> 1:10:21.884
Can we dance?

1:10:22.718 --> 1:10:25.763
-Baby, I don't know. Come on.
-Oh, come on, baby. Please?

1:10:25.846 --> 1:10:29.016
It's my birthday,
and Santi taught me tango today.

1:10:29.099 --> 1:10:30.643
San-what? Why?

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:33.229
-I wanted to learn.
-Get up, let's go. No, come on.

1:10:33.312 --> 1:10:35.856
-It was hot. Yeah.
-Well, we're gonna unlearn it.

1:10:35.940 --> 1:10:37.983
We're gonna unlearn
whatever he taught you.

1:10:38.067 --> 1:10:41.278
-Just because it's your birthday.
-All right, you ready? Let's go.

1:10:43.572 --> 1:10:45.699
No, I… I don't dance.

1:10:45.783 --> 1:10:47.618
-You don't or you can't.
-Won't.

1:10:47.701 --> 1:10:48.661
Will. Let's go.

1:10:48.744 --> 1:10:50.663
-Come on, cowboy. Stand up.
-No, I'm not… Oh.

1:10:50.746 --> 1:10:52.623
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Ah, ah, ah. Okay.

1:10:53.999 --> 1:10:55.251
Come on, you crazy.

1:10:57.336 --> 1:10:59.588
You know how to dance. You can dance.

1:10:59.672 --> 1:11:02.383
-Just move your body a bit.
-I feel a bit self-conscious.

1:11:02.466 --> 1:11:05.177
Loosen up a little bit.
Just like move your limbs.

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:06.929
-Mm-hmm.
-You got it.

1:11:07.012 --> 1:11:08.389
Ooh. Ooh.

1:11:08.472 --> 1:11:09.765
Move your arms. Loosen up.

1:11:09.848 --> 1:11:12.685
Not like that. Less weird.

1:11:12.768 --> 1:11:14.728
Loosen up. There you go. Yeah!

1:11:15.562 --> 1:11:17.564
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you, my love.

1:11:21.443 --> 1:11:24.989
My country needs me.
Homeland security depends on it.

1:11:25.072 --> 1:11:26.573
Santoro, don't be a hero.

1:11:26.657 --> 1:11:28.534
-I'm 60 seconds out.
-I'm moving in.

1:11:28.617 --> 1:11:29.910
Agent, stand down.

1:11:37.209 --> 1:11:38.210
Arms here.

1:11:38.877 --> 1:11:40.170
Get a little crazy.

1:11:52.683 --> 1:11:54.184
Look at you in this dress.

1:12:01.817 --> 1:12:03.235
-Are you okay?
-Bathroom break.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:05.070
-Oh. Okay.
-Gotta take a quick bathroom break.

1:12:05.154 --> 1:12:05.988
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:12:06.071 --> 1:12:07.448
Hey, we gotta go.

1:12:07.531 --> 1:12:09.950
-No, I don't have to go.
-Listen, we gotta. Now! Now!

1:12:12.077 --> 1:12:14.913
You don't normally see two guys
going to the bathroom together.

1:12:14.997 --> 1:12:17.124
-We gotta go!
-What about the dancing?

1:12:18.542 --> 1:12:21.503
-What is going on?
-Santoro, do you copy?

1:12:27.801 --> 1:12:29.094
Moving in through the back.

1:12:31.930 --> 1:12:32.806
They're not here.

1:12:33.390 --> 1:12:34.725
Come on! Come on!

1:12:39.271 --> 1:12:40.522
What is going on?

1:12:41.899 --> 1:12:43.692
That guy… That guy is here, man.

1:12:44.276 --> 1:12:45.903
-Who, the waiter?
-No, not the waiter.

1:12:45.986 --> 1:12:48.447
The guy from Puerto Rico
that tried to kill us. He's here.

1:12:48.530 --> 1:12:51.033
-Do you think Anne likes me?
-What?

1:12:51.116 --> 1:12:53.660
-What are you talking about?
-I was dancing.

1:12:53.744 --> 1:12:54.953
-Hey!
-I mean…

1:12:55.037 --> 1:12:56.455
Snap out of it, man!

1:12:56.538 --> 1:12:58.082
He's trying to kill us!

1:12:58.165 --> 1:13:00.376
I need you to go back
to being the killer you are

1:13:00.459 --> 1:13:02.294
and to understand that we are in trouble!

1:13:02.378 --> 1:13:04.254
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:05.464
He's here!

1:13:05.547 --> 1:13:07.841
-Who?
-Me.

1:13:10.386 --> 1:13:11.678
The Man from Miami.

1:13:12.930 --> 1:13:14.264
Give me the thumb.

1:13:17.976 --> 1:13:18.811
Now.

1:13:24.775 --> 1:13:27.277
Hand it to me. Just walk it over.

1:13:28.654 --> 1:13:29.947
Thumb. What are you…

1:13:30.447 --> 1:13:31.990
Why are you doing that? Stop.

1:13:33.409 --> 1:13:36.245
I still can't believe you stored
a human thumb in a Cheese Puffs bag.

1:13:37.371 --> 1:13:39.289
The Cheese Puffs bag
is what's throwing you off?

1:13:39.373 --> 1:13:40.374
Yeah.

1:13:40.457 --> 1:13:43.085
If you think about it,
the preservatives are…

1:13:43.836 --> 1:13:45.254
keeping the thumb intact.

1:13:46.338 --> 1:13:48.132
Nobody's thinking about that.

1:13:48.632 --> 1:13:51.218
She was right. You're out of control.

1:13:51.301 --> 1:13:52.261
"She"?

1:13:52.970 --> 1:13:56.265
As in the Mrs. Man from Toronto,
your handler.

1:13:56.348 --> 1:13:59.893
She said you'd gone Minnesota again.

1:13:59.977 --> 1:14:00.936
I told you.

1:14:10.195 --> 1:14:11.613
-Ah!

1:14:11.697 --> 1:14:13.240
Stop helping!

1:14:24.585 --> 1:14:26.211
I got your ass!

1:14:35.053 --> 1:14:35.971
Get the gun!

1:14:39.266 --> 1:14:40.476
It's in dirty water!

1:14:41.059 --> 1:14:43.353
Ugh. Oh God.

1:14:45.105 --> 1:14:48.650
I got it! I got it!
I got the gun! I got the gun.

1:14:49.776 --> 1:14:51.278
Move. Move, move!

1:14:51.945 --> 1:14:54.531
Move, so I can shoot his ass. Step aside!

1:14:54.615 --> 1:14:55.699
Shoot him!

1:14:55.782 --> 1:14:57.201
Oh…

1:14:57.284 --> 1:14:59.161
-Argh!

1:15:00.204 --> 1:15:03.123
-Come on.
-I missed.

1:15:09.379 --> 1:15:10.422
Get outta here!

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:18.931
-Front's clear.
-Backup should be arriving now.

1:15:19.014 --> 1:15:20.933
I'm gonna check the kitchen.

1:15:23.101 --> 1:15:24.269
You okay, man?

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:28.148
I was better before you shot me in my leg.

1:15:28.232 --> 1:15:31.026
-It was an accident. I'm sorry. Sorry.
-Yeah, I bet.

1:15:31.527 --> 1:15:32.444
Need some help?

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:34.571
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.

1:15:35.447 --> 1:15:36.698
-Wait.
-Come on. Hurry.

1:15:36.782 --> 1:15:39.451
Wait. Wait. Wait.
No, no, no. We gotta go back there. Lori.

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.912
No, we're going
to the Monarch Hotel right now!

1:15:41.995 --> 1:15:44.706
-What do you mean right now?
-We gotta intercept that thumb.

1:15:44.790 --> 1:15:45.999
It's her birthday dinner!

1:16:00.222 --> 1:16:01.306
Get in.

1:16:01.390 --> 1:16:02.266
Get in what?

1:16:02.766 --> 1:16:03.725
You're driving.

1:16:03.809 --> 1:16:06.728
You want me to steal a cop car?
You don't see the irony in that?

1:16:06.812 --> 1:16:09.773
-Asking a Black man to steal a cop car.
-Get in that car, right now!

1:16:09.856 --> 1:16:11.567
Stop, all right? Just stop. Fine.

1:16:11.650 --> 1:16:13.819
Fine. Know what?
You're gonna deal with the consequences.

1:16:13.902 --> 1:16:16.363
You're gonna talk to Lori!
That's… You're gonna do it.

1:16:16.446 --> 1:16:20.075
I'm not dealin' with nothing
that comes from this. Nothing!

1:16:20.158 --> 1:16:22.786
-What happened to being a person?
-Drive!

1:16:30.877 --> 1:16:32.170
Hola, mi amor.

1:16:33.630 --> 1:16:37.301
There's a man here who claims
he has all you need of Mr. Green.

1:16:44.766 --> 1:16:45.684
Colonel.

1:16:46.268 --> 1:16:47.894
-Who is this?
-No sé.

1:16:48.645 --> 1:16:49.521
I am

1:16:50.188 --> 1:16:51.440
the Man from Miami.

1:16:52.733 --> 1:16:55.569
Think of me as a surprise upgrade.

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:57.696
I don't like surprises.

1:17:00.365 --> 1:17:03.368
-How can I trust you?
-Because I'm telling you to.

1:17:04.411 --> 1:17:05.662
He's one of mine.

1:17:05.746 --> 1:17:07.164
And where is Mr. Green?

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:10.667
Mr. Green couldn't make it. But…

1:17:11.376 --> 1:17:12.461
Uh…

1:17:16.923 --> 1:17:18.383
His thumbprint did.

1:17:18.467 --> 1:17:22.095
Payment will be delivered
after the fireworks.

1:17:23.221 --> 1:17:24.890
Fair enough, my friend.

1:17:30.395 --> 1:17:31.396
They're not here.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:33.982
And It turns out
a patrol car is missing from the scene.

1:17:34.066 --> 1:17:35.651
We're tracking the car now, ma'am.

1:17:35.734 --> 1:17:37.319
They're headed for the Marín meet.

1:17:37.402 --> 1:17:40.197
All right, we are on the move, people.
Let's go! Let's go!

1:17:42.074 --> 1:17:44.576
What about Marín? Are we helping Marín?

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:46.495
I just want my money.

1:17:46.578 --> 1:17:47.454
Oh.

1:17:47.537 --> 1:17:48.497
I got it.

1:17:49.081 --> 1:17:52.209
Know what? It's just like Minnesota
and all those damn people you killed.

1:17:52.292 --> 1:17:53.752
It's no different, man.

1:17:53.835 --> 1:17:56.672
I didn't kill anybody in Minnesota.

1:17:56.755 --> 1:17:58.382
You killed a lot of bodies.

1:17:58.465 --> 1:18:01.885
-That's what killers do. Killers kill.
-I didn't kill anybody!

1:18:09.393 --> 1:18:11.603
I was about
to pull the trigger on a hit.

1:18:13.730 --> 1:18:15.857
The guy was a chronic gambler.

1:18:18.652 --> 1:18:19.986
Owed a lot of money…

1:18:22.322 --> 1:18:24.157
to the wrong people.

1:18:26.910 --> 1:18:28.286
And then I saw the kid.

1:18:29.246 --> 1:18:30.997
Like the kid at the frozen lake?

1:18:35.460 --> 1:18:36.336
I just…

1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:38.630
I wanted to break the cycle.

1:18:42.217 --> 1:18:43.051
Sorry, man.

1:18:44.761 --> 1:18:47.139
But after I set the man free,

1:18:48.807 --> 1:18:50.475
he went on a rampage.

1:18:50.559 --> 1:18:52.644
How would you know he was gonna do that?

1:18:53.729 --> 1:18:57.232
He said, "If you set me free,
I'm gonna go on a rampage."

1:19:00.485 --> 1:19:01.319
Oh.

1:19:01.987 --> 1:19:03.113
Anyway,

1:19:03.196 --> 1:19:05.866
this job gets me my cash, then I'm out.

1:19:07.451 --> 1:19:11.037
Are you talking about your restaurant?
How much do you need to do that?

1:19:11.872 --> 1:19:13.331
Eight mil.

1:19:13.415 --> 1:19:16.418
You could get a whole food court
with that type of money. Damn.

1:19:16.501 --> 1:19:18.503
-I want it to be special.
-Mm.

1:19:18.587 --> 1:19:20.547
Has the number always been eight mil?

1:19:21.131 --> 1:19:22.883
I bet it started out at two.

1:19:22.966 --> 1:19:25.969
You're just like me, man.
You're scared.

1:19:26.052 --> 1:19:28.555
I promise you, on my honor,

1:19:29.639 --> 1:19:31.266
no one gets killed tonight.

1:19:31.892 --> 1:19:34.978
I mean, as near
as you can predict these things.

1:19:35.645 --> 1:19:38.857
But I need you to be me

1:19:39.441 --> 1:19:40.609
one last time.

1:19:44.988 --> 1:19:46.239
Thank you, Jessica.

1:19:46.323 --> 1:19:48.909
We're live here
at the opening gala in Washington, DC

1:19:48.992 --> 1:19:51.328
where the new president
is about to give his speech.

1:19:54.915 --> 1:19:56.333
I dreamed of this day.

1:19:56.416 --> 1:19:58.210
A new Venezuelan embassy.

1:20:03.548 --> 1:20:06.510
To my friends from the United States,
as countries…

1:20:06.593 --> 1:20:08.261
-Please.
-Con gusto.

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:09.930
As you're all aware,

1:20:10.013 --> 1:20:13.058
relationships between
our countries have been…

1:20:13.141 --> 1:20:15.685
They celebrate its opening tonight.

1:20:15.769 --> 1:20:17.062
We sent the desserts.

1:20:17.145 --> 1:20:19.606
They will have their cake,
and we will kill them too.

1:20:19.689 --> 1:20:20.982
I hope you, like me,

1:20:21.066 --> 1:20:23.944
also envision this new building
as the beginning of a new era.

1:20:24.027 --> 1:20:25.320
Give me Coughlin's sequence.

1:20:25.987 --> 1:20:28.031
Like every Venezuelan,

1:20:28.114 --> 1:20:30.325
when on an international stage,

1:20:30.408 --> 1:20:33.495
I'm acutely mindful
of the troubled history

1:20:33.578 --> 1:20:35.455
my beloved country has endured.

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:39.835
Ma'am.

1:20:40.502 --> 1:20:41.670
We have a visitor.

1:20:41.753 --> 1:20:44.965
Now, let's cut the cake!
Celebrate officially…

1:20:45.048 --> 1:20:46.550
And the thumb, please.

1:20:46.633 --> 1:20:47.759
Now.

1:20:49.511 --> 1:20:50.470
Stop!

1:20:51.388 --> 1:20:53.348
These people are imposters.

1:20:53.431 --> 1:20:54.975
Oh. Says who?

1:20:55.559 --> 1:21:00.188
-The Man from Toronto.
-O the bleeding drops of red!

1:21:00.272 --> 1:21:02.941
We don't have time for this.
What's going on?

1:21:03.441 --> 1:21:04.317
Stop it.

1:21:06.736 --> 1:21:07.737
Oy.

1:21:08.655 --> 1:21:10.240
Pleasure is mine, Colonel.

1:21:10.323 --> 1:21:13.034
That is not the Man from Toronto.

1:21:13.118 --> 1:21:14.828
The Man from Toronto is--

1:21:14.911 --> 1:21:16.162
Is what? What is he?

1:21:18.081 --> 1:21:20.041
Say it. I wanna hear it.

1:21:20.584 --> 1:21:24.129
-I have a photo.
-That's a screwup on your side, my friend.

1:21:24.212 --> 1:21:25.338
Oh. I see.

1:21:25.881 --> 1:21:27.757
He's obviously lying.

1:21:27.841 --> 1:21:29.885
His name is Teddy Jackson.

1:21:29.968 --> 1:21:32.846
That's my name? Teddy Jackson?
An obviously fake name.

1:21:32.929 --> 1:21:35.473
That is the Man from Toronto.

1:21:35.557 --> 1:21:37.142
-I've known him for decades.

1:21:37.726 --> 1:21:40.061
That is my driver, Wendell,

1:21:40.145 --> 1:21:43.982
who you've been speaking to
on the phone for the last 20 years.

1:21:44.065 --> 1:21:46.443
Put the guns down.
You're making him nervous.

1:21:46.526 --> 1:21:48.987
He's got a bad stomach
when he's around weapons.

1:21:49.070 --> 1:21:51.698
Who is the Man from Toronto?

1:21:51.781 --> 1:21:53.491
Colonel Marinara, give me a second.

1:21:53.575 --> 1:21:54.743
You know me.

1:21:55.535 --> 1:21:57.120
That's what she said, not me.

1:21:57.203 --> 1:21:59.706
Enlighten me. Tell me something
about myself I don't know.

1:21:59.789 --> 1:22:01.833
'Cause last I checked, I know about me.

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:04.836
So, what do you know about me
that I may not know that you know?

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:05.837
Who's Debora?

1:22:07.672 --> 1:22:09.174
-Oh, that's your question?
-Mm.

1:22:09.883 --> 1:22:11.384
Did you hear that, Wendell?

1:22:12.802 --> 1:22:14.387
She wants to know about Debora.

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:17.223
I'mma let the information fly.

1:22:18.516 --> 1:22:21.061
Debora's a 1969 Dodge Charger.

1:22:21.144 --> 1:22:24.397
-440 R/T--
-440 R/T.

1:22:25.065 --> 1:22:26.232
You know what that means?

1:22:26.316 --> 1:22:31.363
That means I got the big meats in the back
with a sway bar so my ass wiggle.

1:22:32.072 --> 1:22:34.616
When I'm in the streets,
I mark it up so you know I was there.

1:22:35.951 --> 1:22:38.244
It's me pulling off and pulling out.

1:22:38.328 --> 1:22:39.371
Rubbin' and tuggin'.

1:22:39.454 --> 1:22:42.666
But you wouldn't know that
because you don't know me.

1:22:42.749 --> 1:22:45.835
You know why you don't know me?
Because you never met me.

1:22:46.336 --> 1:22:48.088
And that's intentional.

1:22:48.672 --> 1:22:50.298
Because that's how I do business.

1:22:50.382 --> 1:22:52.133
I'm done with the whispering.

1:22:52.217 --> 1:22:54.219
The volume just elevated.

1:22:54.302 --> 1:22:56.513
Because now you're wasting my time.

1:22:56.596 --> 1:23:00.100
You think I'd wait till now
to actually let you speak to me,

1:23:00.183 --> 1:23:01.685
let alone see me?

1:23:01.768 --> 1:23:03.019
To the real me?

1:23:03.603 --> 1:23:06.231
To the me I know I am
right now in this moment,

1:23:06.314 --> 1:23:07.691
and not who you thought I was?

1:23:07.774 --> 1:23:09.192
I know who I am.

1:23:09.776 --> 1:23:11.861
And don't you tell me who I'm not.

1:23:11.945 --> 1:23:14.364
Because that's gonna confuse everybody.

1:23:14.948 --> 1:23:16.700
I saw this whole thing coming.

1:23:19.035 --> 1:23:20.745
You smell that? Because I do.

1:23:21.246 --> 1:23:23.707
It's people trying to play games
with the Man from Toronto.

1:23:23.790 --> 1:23:25.542
You don't play with me!

1:23:25.625 --> 1:23:26.710
I do the playing!

1:23:29.087 --> 1:23:31.214
This is all a mistake.

1:23:31.297 --> 1:23:32.424
You're a mistake!

1:23:32.924 --> 1:23:34.259
This is all pig sex!

1:23:35.552 --> 1:23:36.970
Now, who's ready to oink?

1:23:39.055 --> 1:23:40.640
I know that noise. Y'all hear that?

1:23:45.311 --> 1:23:49.107
-Federal agents! Everybody on the ground!
-On the floor! Don't move!

1:23:49.691 --> 1:23:51.526
Everybody on the ground!

1:23:51.609 --> 1:23:52.694
Get back here!

1:23:55.655 --> 1:23:57.407
-Where are you going?

1:23:58.033 --> 1:23:59.284
Get down! Ah!

1:24:00.076 --> 1:24:03.121
I don't have a weapon!
I don't have it! I don't have it!

1:24:03.621 --> 1:24:05.498
Get back. We're clear!

1:24:21.181 --> 1:24:22.223
Aw, shit.

1:24:24.350 --> 1:24:25.351
Lori!

1:24:31.983 --> 1:24:32.859
Okay.

1:24:40.617 --> 1:24:41.826
Hey, look at this.

1:24:42.410 --> 1:24:44.537
Match to the thumb. It wasn't even Green.

1:24:44.621 --> 1:24:45.872
It was this guy.

1:24:45.955 --> 1:24:47.415
Who the hell is that?

1:24:47.499 --> 1:24:50.126
That's the guy who was
holding the hostages in Puerto Rico.

1:24:50.210 --> 1:24:52.420
But the bomb wouldn't have even gone off.

1:24:52.504 --> 1:24:55.673
I guess the Man from Toronto
wasn't gonna go through with it.

1:24:57.675 --> 1:24:59.969
You're a lucky guy
to know a woman like Lori.

1:25:00.678 --> 1:25:03.056
Once-in-a-lifetime dream. Truly.

1:25:06.601 --> 1:25:07.435
Thank you.

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.108
Hey.

1:25:14.234 --> 1:25:15.944
You saved the world tonight.

1:25:16.945 --> 1:25:18.530
And I lost mine.

1:25:31.709 --> 1:25:33.128
Not today, Stephanie.

1:25:34.045 --> 1:25:36.172
Hey, this is Teddy. I'll call you back.

1:25:37.215 --> 1:25:39.592
I called Marty
because I was worried about you.

1:25:39.676 --> 1:25:41.302
He told me about your job.

1:25:41.803 --> 1:25:43.304
I need some time, Teddy.

1:25:43.388 --> 1:25:44.931
I don't know how much.

1:25:45.014 --> 1:25:47.851
I just… I don't feel like I know you.

1:25:47.934 --> 1:25:52.772
I don't even know if you know you,
what you're looking for, what you need.

1:25:52.856 --> 1:25:56.025
I just wanted you to be there. For once.

1:25:56.526 --> 1:25:58.194
Like you said you would.

1:25:58.778 --> 1:25:59.654
I'm sorry.

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:12.000
I knew you'd pick up.

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:13.251
For old times' sake.

1:26:13.835 --> 1:26:15.503
You know the rules, Toronto.

1:26:15.587 --> 1:26:18.464
You don't complete the job,
you don't collect the cash.

1:26:18.548 --> 1:26:20.633
You bring that money to Yorktown,

1:26:20.717 --> 1:26:22.594
or I'm gonna kill your friend Teddy.

1:26:22.677 --> 1:26:24.929
How's that for your new moral compass?

1:26:25.013 --> 1:26:28.766
Rumors of my morality
have been greatly exaggerated.

1:26:28.850 --> 1:26:32.270
You're a fool if you think
I'm gonna let you have that money.

1:26:32.353 --> 1:26:35.273
You know
what this means, don't you?

1:26:39.652 --> 1:26:41.446
Don't look at me that way, Deb.

1:26:41.529 --> 1:26:43.656
You're a bad influence on me.

1:26:47.452 --> 1:26:48.286
Pass.

1:26:49.204 --> 1:26:50.747
I thought he was dead.

1:26:51.956 --> 1:26:54.500
-Bust.
-Again.

1:26:54.584 --> 1:26:57.086
You've reached your limit with the casino.

1:26:57.879 --> 1:26:58.922
Sir.

1:26:59.005 --> 1:27:00.340
Prison.

1:27:01.966 --> 1:27:03.009
Perfect.

1:27:06.054 --> 1:27:07.388
Please!

1:27:07.472 --> 1:27:08.306
No!

1:27:12.977 --> 1:27:15.730
Well, look at this. Some skin in the game.

1:27:22.111 --> 1:27:24.697
Hey, boys. Looks like we've got a payday.

1:27:43.007 --> 1:27:44.175
So stupid.

1:27:56.938 --> 1:27:58.356
I'm coming, Lori!

1:28:18.918 --> 1:28:20.378
I'm not gonna Teddy this one.

1:28:20.962 --> 1:28:22.005
Ow!

1:28:24.590 --> 1:28:27.176
Ow!

1:28:31.139 --> 1:28:32.348
You remember me.

1:28:33.391 --> 1:28:35.351
-Man from Miami.
-Oh, no.

1:28:36.144 --> 1:28:39.105
-Where is he? Huh?
-I don't know who you're talking about.

1:28:39.188 --> 1:28:40.773
-Where is he?

1:28:41.524 --> 1:28:44.610
I don't know, man.
He took the money and he left me for dead.

1:28:44.694 --> 1:28:46.112
Where is he!

1:28:46.195 --> 1:28:47.488
Where is your friend?

1:28:47.989 --> 1:28:49.282
He's not my friend.

1:28:49.907 --> 1:28:51.617
I got nothing to do with him.

1:28:53.077 --> 1:28:54.120
Toronto.

1:28:54.203 --> 1:28:55.204
Come on. No, man.

1:28:55.288 --> 1:28:56.706
No, don't do it! No!

1:29:07.633 --> 1:29:08.926
You came back for me.

1:29:09.510 --> 1:29:11.929
Yeah, the thought of you dead
just didn't sit right.

1:29:12.013 --> 1:29:13.514
I think I'm going soft.

1:29:15.975 --> 1:29:18.644
Hit me in my back
with a damn club, you bitch.

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:21.939
Hey. I gotta get
to the train station for Lori.

1:29:22.023 --> 1:29:23.566
Yeah, I read your texts.

1:29:23.649 --> 1:29:24.817
You hacked my phone?

1:29:24.901 --> 1:29:28.154
You're the only one who knows who I am.
That makes you a liability.

1:29:29.113 --> 1:29:30.448
Now, let's go get your gal.

1:29:31.532 --> 1:29:33.159
-Over there.

1:29:33.242 --> 1:29:34.494
-Get down!
-Sh…

1:29:34.577 --> 1:29:36.746
Well, well, well. Look who it is.

1:29:38.414 --> 1:29:40.917
-Who the hell are they?
-The Men from Tacoma Brothers.

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:46.130
You done picked a fight
with some people from the medieval time.

1:29:46.214 --> 1:29:47.715
-What the…

1:29:47.799 --> 1:29:49.217
Ow! You shot me in the leg!

1:29:49.300 --> 1:29:52.011
Marty's Fitness. We go through there.
We go through the back door.

1:29:52.095 --> 1:29:54.305
Hey, that's a great idea. Take this.

1:29:54.389 --> 1:29:56.015
I don't want it.
I don't want this.

1:29:56.099 --> 1:29:57.475
You son of a bitch!

1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:01.521
Here I come!

1:30:07.735 --> 1:30:09.070
Anybody hit?

1:30:09.153 --> 1:30:10.863
Oh shit, I missed. I missed!

1:30:10.947 --> 1:30:11.948
I missed!

1:30:14.575 --> 1:30:15.827
Hey, Marty!

1:30:18.413 --> 1:30:19.372
-Teddy?
-Where you at?

1:30:19.455 --> 1:30:22.208
Ah! No, no, no! Don't shoot, don't shoot!
I'll do anything.

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:23.876
I'll give you your job back!

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:26.087
Nobody's gonna shoot you. Eat lead!

1:30:27.171 --> 1:30:30.299
Give me the keys to the back door.
Give me the goddamn keys!

1:30:31.175 --> 1:30:32.427
All right, let's go.

1:30:32.510 --> 1:30:35.096
-You threw my second favorite gun.
-Because it was out of bullets.

1:30:35.179 --> 1:30:36.973
So is this, but I had backup bullets.

1:30:37.056 --> 1:30:38.891
-Well, I didn't.

1:30:39.434 --> 1:30:41.436
You are dead man, Toronto.

1:30:42.812 --> 1:30:45.481
-Who the hell is that?
-The Man from Moscow.

1:30:47.275 --> 1:30:48.693
Nowhere to run, Toronto.

1:30:54.157 --> 1:30:55.366
I suggest contact.

1:30:56.284 --> 1:30:57.368
Watch out!

1:31:00.538 --> 1:31:01.414
Watch out!

1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:09.714
Get off!

1:31:16.137 --> 1:31:17.013
Whoa.

1:31:21.100 --> 1:31:23.102
You're mine.

1:31:24.270 --> 1:31:26.772
♪ He's always laughing
In the midst of power ♪

1:31:26.856 --> 1:31:29.192
♪ Always living in the final hour… ♪

1:31:32.487 --> 1:31:33.988
Oh, you're mine, Toronto!

1:31:37.450 --> 1:31:39.160
We gotta get to the station!

1:31:39.243 --> 1:31:40.995
-I'm aware of the time!

1:31:41.746 --> 1:31:43.247
-Oh!

1:31:48.211 --> 1:31:50.713
♪ He's always laughing
In the midst of power… ♪

1:31:50.796 --> 1:31:51.672
Stop!

1:31:51.756 --> 1:31:52.590
Why?

1:31:53.257 --> 1:31:56.093
Because you're about
to get a dose of my first contact.

1:32:06.270 --> 1:32:07.104
Ow!

1:32:12.693 --> 1:32:13.528
Help!

1:32:14.779 --> 1:32:15.738
You got this!

1:32:36.842 --> 1:32:38.719
You're dead, Toronto!

1:32:40.012 --> 1:32:41.055
Appreciate you.

1:32:53.150 --> 1:32:54.235
Ah!

1:32:55.236 --> 1:32:56.988
-I had him.
-Sure.

1:32:57.071 --> 1:32:58.281
Go, go, go!

1:32:59.991 --> 1:33:01.033
-Get down!

1:33:03.661 --> 1:33:05.162
-Uh!

1:33:13.296 --> 1:33:14.964
End of the road, Toronto.

1:33:22.722 --> 1:33:24.348
Get up, Bubba, let's go.

1:33:29.645 --> 1:33:31.230
Where are you, Toronto?

1:33:41.115 --> 1:33:42.158
Bastard!

1:33:42.241 --> 1:33:43.451
Oh!

1:34:10.645 --> 1:34:12.521
I don't wanna go out like this.

1:34:18.277 --> 1:34:19.737
-What is it?

1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:22.406
Whoo! That's my payday.

1:34:22.490 --> 1:34:24.367
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1:34:26.327 --> 1:34:28.871
Looks like you've
cashed your last check, Toronto.

1:34:36.337 --> 1:34:39.131
You practice these lines
in front of a mirror?

1:34:40.633 --> 1:34:43.636
You recite that
18th-century poetry in the mirror?

1:34:47.223 --> 1:34:48.933
Nineteenth-century, bitch!

1:34:50.101 --> 1:34:51.310
Is that contact?

1:34:52.561 --> 1:34:53.938
Ow!

1:34:54.855 --> 1:34:55.773
Ow!

1:34:56.941 --> 1:34:58.359
Oh my God.

1:35:00.027 --> 1:35:01.278
You saved my life.

1:35:01.362 --> 1:35:02.863
I broke my hand.

1:35:04.448 --> 1:35:06.409
Yeah, that ain't normal. Ah.

1:35:06.492 --> 1:35:08.327
Okay, let's get you to the station.

1:35:08.411 --> 1:35:09.328
Which way?

1:35:09.412 --> 1:35:11.914
-I want my money.

1:35:12.623 --> 1:35:14.166
Aw, come on.

1:35:26.220 --> 1:35:28.931
-Oh, she's pissed. Go.
-Go! Go! Go!

1:35:34.145 --> 1:35:35.020
Let's go!

1:35:48.159 --> 1:35:49.452
Quick, the factory!

1:35:50.578 --> 1:35:51.912
Go. Go! She's coming!

1:35:51.996 --> 1:35:53.539
Watch out! Shit!

1:35:54.039 --> 1:35:55.708
-Teddy! What are you doing, man?
-Get up.

1:35:55.791 --> 1:35:58.377
Henry, tell everybody
to get out of here! Go!

1:35:58.461 --> 1:36:00.045
-Give me that money!

1:36:02.757 --> 1:36:05.551
Warning, pressure loss.

1:36:05.634 --> 1:36:06.802
Shit, go.

1:36:07.303 --> 1:36:09.305
All employees exit the building.

1:36:09.388 --> 1:36:10.473
-Which button?
-I don't know.

1:36:10.556 --> 1:36:12.183
I got handles in my house, not buttons.

1:36:12.266 --> 1:36:14.977
-Just press the buttons.
-Activating boiler.

1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:16.270
-Shit.
-Please.

1:36:16.353 --> 1:36:19.648
Looks like you lost your edge
somewhere in Minnesota, huh?

1:36:20.858 --> 1:36:25.654
You know, there is nothing sadder
than a hard man gone soft.

1:36:25.738 --> 1:36:27.656
Why don't you let him go? You got me.

1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:28.908
Okay.

1:36:32.286 --> 1:36:33.370
What's that?

1:36:33.454 --> 1:36:34.580
Keys to Debora.

1:36:34.663 --> 1:36:35.998
Money's in the trunk.

1:36:36.081 --> 1:36:39.460
If there was ever a time
for you to be a closer, it is now.

1:36:39.543 --> 1:36:43.005
I don't know what you want me to do.
I pressed every button, thing didn't open.

1:36:43.088 --> 1:36:44.465
Okay, let him go.

1:36:44.548 --> 1:36:46.801
Do you forget
how this works, baby?

1:36:46.884 --> 1:36:48.928
We don't let people go.

1:36:49.011 --> 1:36:52.473
-You said, "Don't pull the lever."
-We disappear them, don't we?

1:36:52.556 --> 1:36:54.058
-There's a lever?
-Yes, there's a lever.

1:36:54.141 --> 1:36:57.061
I'm gonna disappear your friend first
and let you watch.

1:36:57.144 --> 1:36:59.396
-Pull that lever.
-You said, "Never lever."

1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:00.439
Sometimes lever.

1:37:01.023 --> 1:37:01.857
Like now.

1:37:04.527 --> 1:37:06.445
-Still nothing.

1:37:06.529 --> 1:37:09.490
-Come on.
-You might've shorted it, Teddy.

1:37:11.075 --> 1:37:11.951
Oh, no.

1:37:12.618 --> 1:37:15.329
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:37:15.412 --> 1:37:16.497
I did that?

1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.082
Okay, well, I hope you're happy.

1:37:18.165 --> 1:37:21.293
I boiled a goddamn
white woman because of you.

1:37:23.462 --> 1:37:24.713
You gotta stop!

1:37:24.797 --> 1:37:26.799
You gotta just die.

1:37:26.882 --> 1:37:29.009
I think you just made human tempura.

1:37:30.553 --> 1:37:32.346
I mean, look. All killing aside…

1:37:34.014 --> 1:37:37.017
…it's just me and you here,
so I can admit, it don't smell bad.

1:37:37.101 --> 1:37:38.936
This air smells like gas, though.

1:37:39.603 --> 1:37:41.063
Not like ass gas,

1:37:41.146 --> 1:37:43.315
but like gas, like fuel. Right?

1:37:44.483 --> 1:37:46.402
-Gas in her jacket or something.

1:37:46.485 --> 1:37:48.320
-Oh shit.
-You do smell it.

1:37:53.951 --> 1:37:54.785
Ow!

1:38:00.666 --> 1:38:02.209
You blew up a warehouse.

1:38:03.168 --> 1:38:04.837
We blew up a warehouse.

1:38:06.338 --> 1:38:07.506
Hey, I, uh…

1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:11.802
I know you said not to say nothing, right?

1:38:11.886 --> 1:38:12.720
But…

1:38:14.388 --> 1:38:17.391
I don't… I don't have many people
that I can open up to, man.

1:38:18.350 --> 1:38:20.853
These last couple of days,
well, it's been, um…

1:38:22.688 --> 1:38:23.689
It's been…

1:38:24.273 --> 1:38:26.317
Well, I can't say it's been good.

1:38:28.402 --> 1:38:29.945
But in some type of, like…

1:38:33.365 --> 1:38:36.660
In some kind of weird way,
you've somehow managed to inspire me.

1:38:38.412 --> 1:38:40.664
Through all this
that we've been through, you…

1:38:41.332 --> 1:38:43.584
you got me wanting to be better, man.

1:38:44.668 --> 1:38:47.588
I mean, I hope…
I'm hoping that I've had, like…

1:38:49.465 --> 1:38:51.508
the same effect on you, you know?

1:38:52.885 --> 1:38:55.930
Maybe we can be friends after this,
stay in each other's life.

1:38:56.889 --> 1:39:00.017
I don't want to get emotional,
but I feel like there's a poss…

1:39:07.232 --> 1:39:08.525
Where is your friend?

1:39:10.903 --> 1:39:11.737
Who are you?

1:39:12.488 --> 1:39:13.614
Man from Tokyo.

1:39:14.114 --> 1:39:15.741
I'm here to kill Toronto.

1:39:16.784 --> 1:39:17.618
I don't have time.

1:39:20.329 --> 1:39:21.830
-Whoa!

1:39:25.876 --> 1:39:27.670
When will this cycle of violence end?

1:39:27.753 --> 1:39:28.837
It ends right now.

1:39:30.047 --> 1:39:31.882
After I finish off this poser.

1:39:33.133 --> 1:39:34.009
Get your girl.

1:39:34.093 --> 1:39:36.053
-What are you talking about?
-Go on. Get in there.

1:39:36.136 --> 1:39:38.722
-You're gonna let me take Debora?
-Yeah, yeah, I'll find you. Hey.

1:39:38.806 --> 1:39:39.640
Two things.

1:39:39.723 --> 1:39:42.184
First thing, you so much
as scratch her, I kill you.

1:39:42.267 --> 1:39:43.143
Second thing--

1:39:43.227 --> 1:39:45.229
Don't forget the first thing.
I already know.

1:39:45.312 --> 1:39:47.398
-Yeah. You got it. Get outta here.
-Thank you. Bye-bye!

1:39:47.481 --> 1:39:48.649
Get outta here!

1:39:59.743 --> 1:40:03.205
In pursuit of
the 1969 Dodge Charger 440 R/T.

1:40:03.288 --> 1:40:05.040
We cannot keep up with it.

1:40:05.124 --> 1:40:06.583
Come on, Teddy. Come on.

1:40:12.172 --> 1:40:13.257
Watch out! Watch out!

1:40:23.392 --> 1:40:24.893
Teddy!

1:40:27.730 --> 1:40:29.106
I'm coming, Lori!

1:40:29.690 --> 1:40:32.985
Next train from Armon
arriving in five minutes.

1:40:41.952 --> 1:40:42.786
Lori!

1:40:44.788 --> 1:40:45.748
Teddy?

1:40:47.374 --> 1:40:50.377
-Hey.
-Oh my God, what the hell happened to you?

1:40:50.461 --> 1:40:51.378
A lot of stuff.

1:40:51.462 --> 1:40:53.797
Honey, yeah, you're bleeding.

1:40:53.881 --> 1:40:57.301
-It's not all my blood.
-Okay, you need medical attention.

1:40:57.384 --> 1:40:58.385
No, no, no.

1:40:58.469 --> 1:41:00.095
That's not what I need.

1:41:00.179 --> 1:41:01.597
I figured it out.

1:41:02.139 --> 1:41:03.515
I know what I need.

1:41:04.183 --> 1:41:05.225
I need you.

1:41:06.435 --> 1:41:07.811
I need you, Lori.

1:41:09.521 --> 1:41:11.023
You're all I ever needed.

1:41:14.860 --> 1:41:18.197
-I'm so sorry, Lori.

1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:19.782
-Oh!

1:41:30.501 --> 1:41:31.543
Oh, that's bad.

1:41:33.087 --> 1:41:34.713
That's not good at all.

1:41:34.797 --> 1:41:35.923
-That is--
-Police!

1:41:37.382 --> 1:41:39.009
Suspect apprehended.

1:41:45.974 --> 1:41:49.144
Do you remember when we met him,
how he couldn't even make eye contact?

1:41:49.228 --> 1:41:50.854
-Now he's in his element.
-Yeah.

1:41:50.938 --> 1:41:55.234
I know. Turns out Mr. Tall, Dark and Scary
is all bark and no bite.

1:41:55.317 --> 1:41:56.902
I feel he's turned over a new leaf.

1:41:56.985 --> 1:41:59.363
He's over that frozen bear
on the lake thing.

1:41:59.446 --> 1:42:02.825
-Oh, totally over that bear thing.
-Question, did you guys like this?

1:42:02.908 --> 1:42:04.284
-Teddy.
-Do we…

1:42:04.368 --> 1:42:06.286
-I don't know what it is.
-Durian sorbet.

1:42:06.370 --> 1:42:09.331
I wanna be polite, so
I don't like it, but I'm gonna finish it.

1:42:09.414 --> 1:42:12.126
-Congratulations on your new restaurant.
-Hello.

1:42:12.209 --> 1:42:13.460
-Hey.
-There he is.

1:42:13.544 --> 1:42:17.798
Lori, you look fantastic.
How's that little loaf rising?

1:42:17.881 --> 1:42:21.593
-What?
-I want to murder everyone all the time.

1:42:21.677 --> 1:42:22.594
-So…
-Yeah.

1:42:22.678 --> 1:42:25.013
-I've been there. Hey, baby.
-Hi.

1:42:26.265 --> 1:42:27.516
-Thank you.
-Oh, I'll get this.

1:42:27.599 --> 1:42:29.309
-No, stop. I got it. I got it.
-No. I…

1:42:29.393 --> 1:42:30.936
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:42:31.019 --> 1:42:33.689
-Okay. That's very nice.
-Back off. No problem.

1:42:33.772 --> 1:42:36.316
What is this?
Is this a three or an eight? I can't tell.

1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:38.443
-Can you see that?
-Oh God. Low toner.

1:42:38.527 --> 1:42:41.155
Low toner. What type of man
doesn't have a spare toner?

1:42:41.238 --> 1:42:42.072
It's an eight.

1:42:44.491 --> 1:42:47.703
Well, thank you for a delicious meal, man.

1:42:47.786 --> 1:42:50.539
We, uh, we appreciate it,
and we'll get the next one.

1:42:51.707 --> 1:42:54.042
-I got good news. Babe, give me a sec.
-Of course.

1:42:54.126 --> 1:42:55.210
-You, come here.
-Yeah.

1:42:55.294 --> 1:42:57.546
Come here. You ready for this one?

1:42:58.297 --> 1:43:01.466
I took the liberty
of making you a partner in my online gym.

1:43:01.550 --> 1:43:03.260
Big moment for us.

1:43:03.343 --> 1:43:06.555
I'm celebrating, which means
I'm gonna let you celebrate too.

1:43:07.598 --> 1:43:11.602
What I have in my hand right now
is your first down payment for your car.

1:43:15.647 --> 1:43:17.524
Is that a one or a seven?

1:43:17.608 --> 1:43:19.234
-That's a one. Yeah.
-Hmm.

1:43:19.318 --> 1:43:21.236
I want Debora back.

1:43:21.904 --> 1:43:24.740
The chassis was cut in half.
The engine practically evaporated.

1:43:24.823 --> 1:43:25.657
She's gone.

1:43:25.741 --> 1:43:27.409
-That's your problem.
-Cut the shit!

1:43:27.910 --> 1:43:29.620
Ow! I can't believe you actually did it!

1:43:37.127 --> 1:43:39.838
Yeah! Way to go, guys.

1:43:39.922 --> 1:43:41.882
Welcome. Welcome to Teddybox.

1:43:41.965 --> 1:43:44.927
I, of course, am Teddy Jackson,
and guess what?

1:43:45.010 --> 1:43:48.555
Here, the only opponent is yourself.
Don't you forget it.

1:43:48.639 --> 1:43:51.558
We're brick-and-mortar now, guys,
which means things are changing.

1:43:51.642 --> 1:43:53.185
They're getting bigger and better!

1:43:53.268 --> 1:43:55.729
And we're bringing you
one online class per week!

1:43:55.812 --> 1:43:57.689
That means I can talk to you guys live.

1:43:57.773 --> 1:44:01.151
And today,
we got our first ever online call.

1:44:01.235 --> 1:44:03.612
Uh, calling all the way from Toronto.

1:44:03.695 --> 1:44:05.322
Um, okay.

1:44:05.405 --> 1:44:06.240
Talk to me.

1:44:06.823 --> 1:44:08.909

I had a dream about her last night.

1:44:10.494 --> 1:44:11.536
That's graphic.

1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:14.498
That's… That's a lot, sir.
I wanna remind you that we're live.

1:44:14.581 --> 1:44:18.001
We got about 8,000 viewers
in here right now, not to mention kids.

1:44:18.085 --> 1:44:19.878
-So we keep--
-I miss her.

1:44:20.587 --> 1:44:23.715
Quite sure you miss her
for good reason, sir. Whoever she is.

1:44:24.216 --> 1:44:25.759
You know damn well who.

1:44:25.842 --> 1:44:26.927
Debora.

1:44:27.010 --> 1:44:27.970
You killed her.

1:44:28.053 --> 1:44:29.721
Oh, stop that.

1:44:29.805 --> 1:44:31.014
Not while we're live.

1:44:31.098 --> 1:44:34.017
You don't tell anybody they killed
somebody, especially without proof.

1:44:34.101 --> 1:44:36.103
That's what we call a strong accusation.

1:44:36.186 --> 1:44:37.145
Not true at all.

1:44:37.229 --> 1:44:40.774
Maybe I should come down there
and non-contact your face.

1:44:40.857 --> 1:44:41.900
Or not, sir.

1:44:41.984 --> 1:44:45.362
This is online, so you don't have to come
all the way from Toronto

1:44:45.445 --> 1:44:46.905
when you can talk to me now.

1:44:46.989 --> 1:44:49.533
-That's the beauty.
-I'm not in Toronto, Teddy.

1:44:49.616 --> 1:44:51.910
What does that mean? What are you saying?

1:44:52.494 --> 1:44:53.495
Where are you?

1:44:53.578 --> 1:44:55.372
I'm standing outside.

1:44:57.249 --> 1:44:58.333
Oh, !
