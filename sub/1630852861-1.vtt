00:19.511 --> 00:20.779
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

00:20.912 --> 00:23.147
<i>my family moved around a lot.</i>

00:23.281 --> 00:25.917
<i>Switching schools
six times in four years</i>

00:26.017 --> 00:27.820
<i>made it pretty tough
to make friends.</i>

00:27.952 --> 00:30.288
<i>But over time,
I got pretty good at it.</i>

00:30.456 --> 00:34.693
<i>I even stopped questioning
why we needed to move so often.</i>

00:34.827 --> 00:36.861
<i>When my dad's job
took my mom and me</i>

00:36.994 --> 00:38.963
<i>to Patterson Grove,
Pennsylvania,</i>

00:39.130 --> 00:42.133
<i>I thought we had just moved
to another boring little town.</i>

00:42.934 --> 00:45.103
<i>I couldn't have been more wrong.</i>

00:46.304 --> 00:49.307
<i>That June,
I had to go to summer school.</i>

00:49.475 --> 00:50.875
<i>I wasn't happy about it,</i>

00:51.008 --> 00:53.311
<i>but it was there
that I met four other kids</i>

00:53.479 --> 00:55.614
<i>who became very close friends.</i>

00:57.383 --> 00:59.984
<i>It was during that summer
when those kids and I</i>

01:00.151 --> 01:02.821
<i>discovered something
I still can't believe was real.</i>

01:04.021 --> 01:06.525
<i>It changed the way
I felt about myself.</i>

01:06.658 --> 01:08.861
<i>It changed the way
I felt about my father.</i>

01:08.993 --> 01:11.663
<i>It changed the way
I felt about the world.</i>

01:11.797 --> 01:15.367
<i>And it all started on
that first day of school.</i>

02:41.954 --> 02:43.755
<i>I can't believe you!</i>

02:43.922 --> 02:46.925
<i>I told you to stop
babying that kid.</i>

02:47.091 --> 02:48.794
<i>He's soft enough as it is.</i>

02:48.927 --> 02:50.496
<i>He's just sensitive,
is all.</i>

02:50.629 --> 02:53.599
<i>Sensitive?
Are you for real?</i>

02:53.732 --> 02:55.334
<i>You know,
you could learn a thing or two.</i>

02:55.467 --> 02:58.570
<i>Like what? How to bury
my head in comic books</i>

02:58.670 --> 03:01.138
<i>and monster magazines?</i>

03:01.272 --> 03:03.274
<i>He's just a boy.
He's supposed to love monsters</i>

03:03.442 --> 03:05.811
- <i>and superheroes.</i>
- <i>A boy? He's...</i>

03:05.944 --> 03:07.779
<i>he's nearly a teenager!</i>

03:07.913 --> 03:09.247
<i>And there will be time</i>

03:09.348 --> 03:11.115
<i>for more serious things
when he is.</i>

03:11.249 --> 03:13.619
<i>Yeah. If he can keep
from wetting the bed</i>

03:13.785 --> 03:16.355
<i>or running off
to elope with a Yeti!</i>

03:16.488 --> 03:18.857
<i>You really are
a pathetic child.</i>

03:18.991 --> 03:21.460
<i>Oh, I'll show you
a damn child.</i>

03:30.268 --> 03:31.837
<i>Where are you going?
Get back here.</i>

03:31.970 --> 03:33.605
<i>I haven't even started
with you yet.</i>

03:35.507 --> 03:37.676
When I grow up,
my kids will never have to face

03:37.809 --> 03:40.111
the real monsters of this world.

04:28.927 --> 04:30.227
What's happening,
little brother?

04:30.362 --> 04:32.064
How many years
you been held back?

04:32.196 --> 04:34.198
Oh, you got
this scene all wrong.

04:34.366 --> 04:35.701
I'm a teacher here.

04:36.702 --> 04:39.170
Sometimes I need
to just stand outside,

04:39.270 --> 04:41.673
remind myself that
the world is my classroom.

04:41.773 --> 04:43.875
So where do you keep
the erasers?

04:44.009 --> 04:45.711
You're new here, right?

04:45.877 --> 04:47.178
I'm always new somewhere.

04:47.278 --> 04:49.381
We move around a lot
with my dad's job.

04:49.548 --> 04:51.215
So what's your scene?

04:51.383 --> 04:53.785
The usual stuff,
music, comics, movies.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.621
Mmm, movies, huh?

04:55.754 --> 04:57.623
I'm a Kubrick fan myself.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.223
More making than watching.

04:59.391 --> 05:01.693
We got kids here
that are down with that.

05:01.793 --> 05:04.062
Got a whole film club
and everything.

05:04.228 --> 05:07.366
Right now, I'm kind of French
New Wave meets the Ramones.

05:07.466 --> 05:08.900
Not sure that's anybody's thing.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.569
You might be surprised.

05:12.571 --> 05:14.539
Well, there's the bell.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.774
You better get inside.

05:15.907 --> 05:18.677
- Okay, Mister...
- Kapatelis.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.879
But the kids here
call me The Captain.

05:20.979 --> 05:22.414
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Hmm.

05:22.581 --> 05:23.749
You got it all wrong.

05:23.915 --> 05:25.417
More of a captain of the mind.

05:37.929 --> 05:39.296
Hey, you got a hall pass?

05:39.431 --> 05:40.799
Do you?

05:41.232 --> 05:42.434
I got five.

05:42.601 --> 05:43.769
I just got the one.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.805
You must be new here, you
wouldn't talk to us that way.

05:46.938 --> 05:47.939
Just moved here.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.741
Some kind of military brat?

05:49.841 --> 05:51.143
- Nope.
- Your dad's kind of wussy,

05:51.275 --> 05:53.612
not enough man
to get in the army?

05:53.779 --> 05:56.148
Bet he's one of them kids
got two dads.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.655
Don't turn your back on us,

06:03.789 --> 06:05.924
you'll be sorry for turning
your back on us.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.594
<i>The Patterson Grove
welcoming committee</i>

06:09.695 --> 06:11.029
<i>left a lot to be desired.</i>

06:11.797 --> 06:13.465
<i>But luckily, I found out quickly</i>

06:13.632 --> 06:16.802
<i>that I wasn't the only
filmmaker at my new school.</i>

06:17.536 --> 06:19.805
<i>While I was hopeful
about making friends</i>

06:19.938 --> 06:21.707
<i>with similar hobbies,</i>

06:21.840 --> 06:23.975
<i>my dad was about
to get a surprise visit</i>

06:24.109 --> 06:26.445
<i>from an unexpected guest.</i>

07:28.707 --> 07:31.576
<i>Will, are you there?</i>

07:31.710 --> 07:33.879
<i>Please respond. Over.</i>

07:34.012 --> 07:35.347
Yeah, I'm here, Ricky,

07:35.447 --> 07:37.215
and you just made me
jump out of my skin.

07:37.349 --> 07:39.451
<i>Sorry, good buddy. Over.</i>

07:39.584 --> 07:41.353
Can we drop the whole
"Over" thing?

07:41.453 --> 07:43.221
- It just feels weird to me.
- <i>Sure thing.</i>

07:43.388 --> 07:45.257
Just get it out of your system.

07:45.390 --> 07:47.893
<i>Sure thing. Over.</i>

07:48.026 --> 07:50.228
Okay, are we all set now?

07:50.362 --> 07:51.463
<i>Yup.</i>

07:51.596 --> 07:54.032
<i>Aren't you gonna ask me
what I'm up to?</i>

07:54.132 --> 07:56.034
Sorry, I have a lot on
my mind right now.

07:56.134 --> 07:57.569
<i>Oh, man.</i>

07:57.736 --> 07:58.770
<i>Are they at it again?</i>

07:58.904 --> 08:00.272
Unfortunately.

08:00.405 --> 08:02.707
<i>What set them
off this time?</i>

08:02.808 --> 08:04.576
Their favorite subject.

08:04.743 --> 08:05.977
- <i>You?</i>
- Bingo.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.913
<i>I'm sorry, good buddy.</i>

08:08.079 --> 08:09.815
It's fine.
As soon as I'm old enough

08:09.948 --> 08:11.449
I'm gonna split
and never look back.

08:11.583 --> 08:14.986
<i>No one would blame you,
that's for sure.</i>

08:15.120 --> 08:16.588
I just don't get it, is all.

08:16.755 --> 08:18.089
I'm not a bad kid.

08:18.223 --> 08:19.991
I stay out of trouble.
I get good grades.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.093
<i>I'm sorry, good buddy.</i>

08:22.227 --> 08:24.095
I just don't know what
my old man wants from me.

08:24.229 --> 08:26.231
<i>Hey, man,
if I understood parents,</i>

08:26.331 --> 08:29.467
<i>I'd write a book about it
and be rolling in dough.</i>

08:29.601 --> 08:31.269
Now that I believe.

08:31.403 --> 08:34.506
<i>Not to take away from
your wonderful tales</i>

08:34.639 --> 08:35.941
<i>of home sweet home...</i>

08:36.107 --> 08:38.243
No, please, change the subject.

08:38.342 --> 08:40.278
<i>I think I found it.</i>

08:40.445 --> 08:42.647
- It?
- <i>Yeah, it!</i>

08:42.780 --> 08:45.684
<i>The perfect location to
film our monster movie.</i>

08:45.817 --> 08:48.653
<i>Walking in Bigfoot's shoes
is one step closer</i>

08:48.787 --> 08:50.589
<i>to becoming a reality.</i>

08:51.423 --> 08:53.291
That's so cool. Where are you?

08:53.425 --> 08:54.826
<i>The south end
of the Winchell,</i>

08:54.960 --> 08:56.461
<i>just off Thorn Path.</i>

08:57.095 --> 08:58.496
You mean Winchell, the woods?

08:58.630 --> 09:00.999
<i>You know another Winchell?</i>

09:01.132 --> 09:02.968
Good point. Good news.

09:03.134 --> 09:05.303
I'm there, too,
just on the other end.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.639
I'll start heading your way.
See you soon.

09:07.772 --> 09:08.974
<i>Right on!</i>

09:36.801 --> 09:38.337
Will?

09:47.412 --> 09:48.914
Will?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.882
Where are you?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.355
Will?

09:59.858 --> 10:01.360
Will!

10:09.100 --> 10:10.702
Will?

10:17.509 --> 10:18.710
No.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.524
No.

10:35.794 --> 10:36.761
No.

10:50.409 --> 10:51.776
Come in, come in. Uh, my people,

10:51.910 --> 10:54.579
this is the new student
I was telling you about.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.047
Hey man, I'm Boone.

10:56.147 --> 10:57.482
I think we met
in American History today.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.385
You know what I said about
American history?

10:59.484 --> 11:01.252
It was written by the winners.

11:01.653 --> 11:03.722
- This is my girlfriend, Sandra.
- Hey.

11:03.822 --> 11:05.790
Hey, I'm Millie.

11:05.924 --> 11:07.426
Hey, I'm Cory.

11:07.592 --> 11:09.594
So I'm working on, like, my own
Logan's Run movie,

11:09.761 --> 11:11.596
only good,
and I'm trying to figure out

11:11.763 --> 11:13.164
if I could do lasers
or something.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.266
Maybe some dry ice,
some flashlights.

11:15.401 --> 11:16.968
Not sure about
the dry ice though.

11:17.102 --> 11:19.104
No, you just need to take a pin,

11:19.237 --> 11:20.939
scratch the emulsion
off the back.

11:21.072 --> 11:23.074
Then the light shines through
and makes it look like a laser.

11:23.174 --> 11:25.944
- Won't that destroy the film?
- Nah, man. I do it all the time.

11:26.077 --> 11:28.079
I even poke holes through
to make gunshots.

11:28.179 --> 11:29.781
How can you see
the end of the guns?

11:29.914 --> 11:31.783
My dad has a Minette Viewer
for editing,

11:31.950 --> 11:33.151
makes it a lot easier.

11:33.284 --> 11:35.153
Man, I could do
with one of those.

11:35.286 --> 11:36.955
That's pretty cool.

11:37.122 --> 11:38.323
So is your dad into this, too?

11:38.457 --> 11:39.924
Yeah, it's something
we do together

11:40.025 --> 11:41.793
but he's been into it
for a long time.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.462
That is pretty cool.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.663
My old man pretty much
stops at John Wayne and PBR.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.433
We got a bunch of Super 8

11:47.532 --> 11:49.968
silent stuff to watch,
Chaplin, Harold Lloyd.

11:50.135 --> 11:51.636
We even got some Tom Mix,

11:51.770 --> 11:53.838
some other cool stuff,
clips from 20 Million Miles

11:53.972 --> 11:55.140
to Earth; Rodan.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.008
That's the good stuff there.

11:57.142 --> 11:58.643
I need to meet this dude.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.712
You should bring some of those
to the next meeting.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.680
I will. I think he would let me.

12:02.814 --> 12:05.683
He makes his own movies, too,
since before I was born.

12:05.817 --> 12:07.486
What kind of movies?

12:07.619 --> 12:10.555
Not fiction really, more like
whatever was going on stuff.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.564
Home movies,
family vacations stuff?

12:19.697 --> 12:22.501
No, more like, life.

12:22.634 --> 12:24.135
Life, man.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.505
So what are
you working on yourself?

12:26.638 --> 12:28.507
Little of this, little of that.

12:28.673 --> 12:32.511
Keeping it on
the auteur side, I dig that.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.522
So bring some of
your stuff next week, man,

12:43.655 --> 12:45.190
so we can figure out some of
the.

12:45.357 --> 12:46.691
If I have something ready.

12:46.825 --> 12:48.226
Dude,
I already told you all about

12:48.360 --> 12:49.528
my Logan's Run homage.

12:56.701 --> 12:59.204
I told you not to turn
your back on us.

13:03.342 --> 13:05.176
Found a boyfriend on
your first day?

13:05.276 --> 13:06.911
You must really put out.

13:07.045 --> 13:09.180
See, I would say something
about your mom putting out,

13:09.280 --> 13:10.615
but it's just too easy.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.351
You're just pitching
these in underhand.

13:12.451 --> 13:15.019
I'm the one hitting,
not pitching.

13:30.034 --> 13:31.102
What's all this?

13:31.236 --> 13:32.371
'Sup, Bob.

13:32.471 --> 13:34.440
'Sup little bro, get in.

13:34.973 --> 13:36.040
Hey, Bob.

13:36.141 --> 13:38.209
Who said you can call me Bob?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.813
It's Bobbi to you.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.717
And don't you have
a T-ball game to get to?

13:56.261 --> 13:58.096
Thanks for bailing us out, sis.

13:58.564 --> 14:01.099
When I was a senior,
those two were sophomores.

14:01.232 --> 14:04.135
And now they're seniors
and you guys are sophomores.

14:04.269 --> 14:05.937
But I'm two years gone
from this dump

14:06.070 --> 14:07.739
and that's just how
the food chain works.

14:07.839 --> 14:10.108
Let's play some tunes.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.793
Hey, see you at school
tomorrow, Mills.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.141
So where do you live, new guy?

14:43.274 --> 14:45.377
Hang a left.

14:47.479 --> 14:48.846
Hey Bob, pull over.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.315
- What?
- Pull over.

15:04.295 --> 15:07.333
Do not put that on your foot.

15:17.343 --> 15:18.677
What?

15:18.810 --> 15:20.245
You see tennis shoes sometimes

15:20.379 --> 15:21.913
laying on
the side of the road, but...

15:22.046 --> 15:24.249
who finds a dress shoe
laying on the side of the road?

15:24.383 --> 15:26.985
You still on
this haunted woods thing?

15:27.085 --> 15:28.354
Haunted woods?

15:28.520 --> 15:30.589
Those stories even
go back to my day.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.857
Some sort of monster who's
supposedly lives out there.

15:32.991 --> 15:35.327
Every once in a while,
somebody goes missing,

15:35.427 --> 15:37.028
never heard from again.

15:37.195 --> 15:38.930
Sounds like a movie.

15:39.365 --> 15:41.065
I'm not going out there
to shoot a movie.

15:41.199 --> 15:43.001
People don't go out
to those woods for anything.

15:43.101 --> 15:44.737
No partying, nothing.

15:44.869 --> 15:47.573
Great. I live just
across from it,

15:47.706 --> 15:49.375
the other side of that field.

15:52.944 --> 15:54.912
Let's get going.

16:27.879 --> 16:29.881
Hey man, it's good to
have you in the club.

16:29.981 --> 16:31.249
Hey, thanks.

16:31.383 --> 16:32.917
You guys want to come in?

16:33.051 --> 16:34.285
Sure.

16:55.073 --> 16:56.307
Mom.

16:57.810 --> 16:58.910
Cory.

16:59.010 --> 17:00.646
I didn't realize school
was out already.

17:00.779 --> 17:02.414
What's happened, Mom?

17:02.514 --> 17:04.349
Where's Dad?

17:04.915 --> 17:07.117
Your dad's gone.

17:07.251 --> 17:09.287
He started drinking again.

17:09.788 --> 17:11.589
I had to ask him to leave.

17:12.123 --> 17:14.291
That...
that doesn't sound like Dad.

17:14.626 --> 17:18.630
It's being back here after
all these years.

17:18.797 --> 17:21.367
There's some hard memories here.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.301
<i>Come home to
a house like this?</i>

17:25.869 --> 17:27.972
<i>I deserve some respect!</i>

17:29.541 --> 17:31.477
Who are your friends?

17:32.378 --> 17:34.780
This is Boone,
his older sister, Bobbi.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.483
People call me Roberta, ma'am.

17:37.649 --> 17:39.150
This is Boone's girlfriend,
Sandra.

17:39.283 --> 17:40.619
Hi.

17:40.719 --> 17:43.321
We better go in.
See you at school tomorrow.

17:43.455 --> 17:45.323
See ya.

17:51.630 --> 17:53.665
What's really going on, Mom?

17:54.031 --> 17:57.168
Nothing. Wh...
what I told you is the truth.

17:58.169 --> 18:00.372
Please just go to
your room until supper.

18:00.506 --> 18:01.840
- But Mom...
- Please, just

18:01.973 --> 18:03.007
go to your room.

18:07.846 --> 18:10.014
We never should have
come back here.

18:18.690 --> 18:19.991
<i>Where the heck</i>

18:20.091 --> 18:21.827
- <i>are ya, man?</i>
- I'm getting there,

18:21.926 --> 18:24.262
- I just stopped to rest is all.
- <i>Rest?</i>

18:24.396 --> 18:27.533
<i>You need to lay off
the TV dinners, good buddy.</i>

18:27.666 --> 18:29.033
You might be right.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.035
<i>Anyway,
you can take your time.</i>

18:31.169 --> 18:32.937
<i>I just set up camp.</i>

18:33.070 --> 18:35.674
Camp?
You're gonna sleep out here?

18:35.774 --> 18:37.376
- <i>You know it.</i>
- Won't your parents

18:37.509 --> 18:40.244
- wonder where you are?
- <i>No way. I told them</i>

18:40.412 --> 18:42.881
<i>I'm staying overnight
at your place.</i>

18:43.047 --> 18:45.116
You're better off out here.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.553
<i>That's the truth.</i>

18:47.719 --> 18:49.220
You brought the tent
and everything?

18:49.388 --> 18:50.722
<i>Of course.</i>

18:50.856 --> 18:53.559
<i>Plus, a full kit
and the trusty Super 8.</i>

18:53.725 --> 18:57.061
<i>I'm gonna get as much footage
as I can while I'm roughing it.</i>

18:57.228 --> 18:58.229
Solid.

18:58.397 --> 19:01.065
<i>Whoa, that's weird.</i>

19:01.199 --> 19:02.534
What is?

19:02.634 --> 19:04.570
<i>All the birds
and stuff...</i>

19:06.472 --> 19:08.874
<i>they stopped making noise.</i>

19:08.973 --> 19:10.576
Here, too.

19:18.249 --> 19:19.785
Listen to this.

19:19.918 --> 19:21.620
"All sounds in
the forest dropped

19:21.753 --> 19:23.422
"in the presence of
the Sasquatch,

19:23.555 --> 19:26.090
"as if the whole of the animal
kingdom paid their respects

19:26.257 --> 19:28.894
- "to their lord and master."
- <i>Oh man,</i>

19:28.993 --> 19:31.964
<i>his could be the greatest thingt
that ever happened to our film!</i>

19:32.096 --> 19:35.767
Yeah, if we live long
enough to make it.

19:48.947 --> 19:50.482
<i>I knew something was up</i>

19:50.616 --> 19:51.984
<i>with my mom's story,</i>

19:52.116 --> 19:53.452
<i>but I just couldn't
figure out why</i>

19:53.585 --> 19:55.152
<i>she wouldn't tell me the truth.</i>

19:57.756 --> 19:59.257
<i>Maybe it had something
to do with</i>

19:59.358 --> 20:02.026
<i>he car I'd seen parked outsidet
our house earlier.</i>

20:02.159 --> 20:03.595
<i>I wasn't certain</i>

20:03.695 --> 20:06.431
<i>until I saw it in
my backyard again.</i>

20:42.501 --> 20:44.168
Yes, police?

20:45.671 --> 20:47.305
I want to report...

20:48.540 --> 20:50.174
I want to report a missing...

20:52.477 --> 20:54.178
No.

20:54.278 --> 20:55.881
No.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.220
It's, um, Beth. Will's gone.

21:04.423 --> 21:06.758
Yeah, somebody's gone through
the old films.

21:07.659 --> 21:09.661
I know we shouldn't have
come back here.

22:03.081 --> 22:05.316
Your dad hid it? Why?

22:05.450 --> 22:06.818
I don't know.

22:06.952 --> 22:08.319
I've always been able
to watch his stuff,

22:08.453 --> 22:10.422
but he always had one reel
he stashed away

22:10.555 --> 22:11.890
I could never look at.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.290
When I saw our place
had been trashed,

22:13.425 --> 22:14.993
it was the only thing
I could think of

22:15.127 --> 22:16.561
he's ever hidden away
from people.

22:16.662 --> 22:17.663
My mom's hiding something,

22:17.796 --> 22:19.064
trying to protect me.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.899
My dad never
came home last night,

22:20.999 --> 22:22.934
and it's not
from getting too drunk.

22:23.735 --> 22:25.504
How can we help?

22:25.637 --> 22:27.271
Could you watch this with me?

22:27.439 --> 22:28.840
You guys know Super 8,

22:28.974 --> 22:30.509
and maybe you'll see
something in this I don't.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.277
Plus, you guys are
from the area, and something...

22:33.445 --> 22:35.279
something my mom said
makes me think

22:35.447 --> 22:36.782
this was shot around here.

22:36.948 --> 22:38.350
- What?
- Yeah.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.752
My mom and dad lived here
back before I was born.

22:40.852 --> 22:43.622
Well, they've lived
a lot of places, but...

22:43.755 --> 22:45.624
I just have this feeling.

22:45.957 --> 22:47.291
Let's reel it up, man.

22:52.130 --> 22:55.033
So you've lived a lot of places?

22:55.167 --> 22:56.868
Yeah.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.805
I did, too, once my dad left.

22:59.938 --> 23:01.540
It's not easy.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.375
No, it's not.

26:33.685 --> 26:34.853
Your dad shot that?

26:35.020 --> 26:36.355
I guess so, yeah.

26:36.521 --> 26:38.189
I haven't been out in
those woods much, but...

26:38.357 --> 26:39.925
that sure looks like 'em.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.227
Looks like trees to me.

26:42.361 --> 26:45.163
Yeah, but it's more of the vibe.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.367
I thought you said he wasn't
into doing fiction.

26:48.533 --> 26:49.567
He wasn't.

26:51.870 --> 26:54.572
Then what was that?

27:40.719 --> 27:41.953
Watch your step.

27:44.756 --> 27:46.091
Are you crazy?

27:46.224 --> 27:48.326
People run through here.

27:50.261 --> 27:52.097
Beats shootin' it.

27:52.263 --> 27:53.665
I don't know who you guys are.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.567
I'm not even gonna ask you
if you have permits

27:55.667 --> 27:57.769
to be out here.
I'm just out of here.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.687
It's been through here.

28:17.856 --> 28:21.826
<i>Will, you okay?</i>

28:21.960 --> 28:23.294
Yeah.

28:23.429 --> 28:25.797
<i>I...
I think I see something.</i>

28:25.930 --> 28:26.998
Well, what is it?

28:27.132 --> 28:29.100
<i>I don't know, but it's...</i>

28:29.200 --> 28:31.636
- <i>big.</i>
- Is it a bear?

28:31.803 --> 28:34.340
<i>I don't know.
It's hunched over, and...</i>

28:34.473 --> 28:37.108
<i>it's dark,
but it's too far away.</i>

28:38.276 --> 28:40.011
Maybe you should get
the hell out of there.

28:40.145 --> 28:41.679
- <i>No way!</i>
- Come on, man.

28:41.813 --> 28:44.616
- Our film isn't worth dying for!
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

28:45.216 --> 28:47.052
<i>It just stood up.</i>

28:47.786 --> 28:48.820
<i>It's not a bear!</i>

28:48.953 --> 28:50.121
Ricky. Ricky, what's going on?

28:50.221 --> 28:52.358
<i>It's him! It's Bigfoot!</i>

28:52.491 --> 28:55.293
<i>Don't worry, I'll protect
the camera with my life.</i>

28:55.394 --> 28:57.729
<i>This footage is going
to be amazing!</i>

28:57.862 --> 28:59.664
Hang on. I'm coming.

29:07.005 --> 29:08.073
So what are we going do?

29:08.206 --> 29:09.508
What are <i>we</i> gonna do?

29:09.641 --> 29:11.843
You showed us the movie.
Now it's a "we".

29:12.010 --> 29:13.345
My dad's missing.

29:13.479 --> 29:14.913
You say there is something
in the woods.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.314
My dad's movie looks like

29:16.415 --> 29:18.016
it was shot there
back in the day, so...

29:18.149 --> 29:19.217
maybe he's in the woods.

29:19.351 --> 29:20.519
That woods, it's...

29:20.652 --> 29:22.187
it's not like a grove of trees.

29:22.354 --> 29:23.556
It's a couple
of acres out there.

29:23.688 --> 29:25.690
So maybe it's not a recon hike.

29:25.824 --> 29:27.359
Maybe it's a camp out.

29:27.526 --> 29:28.927
Man, haven't you listening
to anything anybody's said?

29:29.060 --> 29:30.529
You watched your dad's movie.

29:30.695 --> 29:32.398
So we'll take a tent
and say we're going camping

29:32.531 --> 29:34.265
if a cop or rancher
or somebody else stops us.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.767
You don't get it, bro.
There are no cops

29:35.900 --> 29:37.769
and there are no rangers
out in those woods.

29:38.269 --> 29:39.604
I have a tent.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.540
It's my little brother's
old Boy Scout tent.

29:41.673 --> 29:44.676
He quit after a years
and nobody uses it now.

29:45.043 --> 29:48.012
Cool. I'll tell my mom
I'm at Millie's Saturday night.

29:48.113 --> 29:49.214
Millie says she's at my house,

29:49.381 --> 29:50.882
Boone says he's at Cory's,

29:51.015 --> 29:52.750
Cory's at Boone's. Easy peasy.

29:52.884 --> 29:54.686
Cool. I'll make sandwiches.

29:54.786 --> 29:56.187
Is this a plan?

29:56.287 --> 29:57.889
Except for my folks
don't care where I am.

29:58.022 --> 29:59.525
Yeah, sounds like a good plan.

29:59.624 --> 30:01.427
You got film stock
in case we find anything?

30:01.560 --> 30:03.228
I always have film stock.

30:03.362 --> 30:05.296
Shooting a porno with your mom?

30:06.365 --> 30:08.066
Looks like somebody raked
the cat box.

30:08.233 --> 30:10.034
Shut up.
You don't got Boone's big sister

30:10.135 --> 30:11.236
to bail you out of this one.

30:11.403 --> 30:12.804
They don't need her.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.240
They have me.

30:15.374 --> 30:17.275
Ugh, what the hell is that?

30:17.409 --> 30:20.044
It's for when I don't feel
so fresh, as a woman.

30:20.145 --> 30:21.447
It stings.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.114
Calm down,
it's the closest you'll ever be.

30:23.248 --> 30:25.250
It's just perfume, doofus.

30:27.218 --> 30:28.219
Ugh.

30:28.319 --> 30:30.088
Smelling pretty hurts.

30:30.255 --> 30:32.424
Ugh, get this stuff off of me.

30:33.559 --> 30:34.893
You didn't do nothing!

30:34.993 --> 30:37.095
What do you want?
I got three older sisters,

30:37.262 --> 30:38.497
I know what can happen.

30:38.631 --> 30:40.432
I've been drug up
the stairs by my hair

30:40.566 --> 30:42.934
so many times,
it's lucky I'm not bald.

30:43.101 --> 30:45.303
Thanks for having my back, jerk.

30:46.438 --> 30:49.441
You gotta admit,
she sure does smell pretty.

30:50.275 --> 30:51.943
Hey, wait!

31:05.457 --> 31:08.259
You move pretty quick
for a blind guy.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.461
I'm fine.

31:09.595 --> 31:10.962
So what do we do now?

31:11.129 --> 31:13.298
We tried to show them
who's boss twice now.

31:13.432 --> 31:15.534
Third time lucky.

31:42.328 --> 31:43.995
Y'all stick out like...

31:44.128 --> 31:47.899
a couple of brown skid marks
on a pair of tighty-whites.

31:48.299 --> 31:49.968
We ain't doing nothing.

31:51.836 --> 31:54.640
Kid says
they ain't doing nothing...

31:55.240 --> 31:58.009
you know damn well...

31:58.176 --> 31:59.911
they're doing something.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.085
Y'all weren't planning
on going off and

32:07.218 --> 32:10.389
doing something stupid
in them woods now, would you?

32:10.522 --> 32:13.559
Nope.
But I know someone who does.

32:14.192 --> 32:15.893
Well....

32:17.262 --> 32:18.763
Do tell.

32:27.939 --> 32:29.040
Cory.

32:30.008 --> 32:31.209
Is school out already?

32:31.343 --> 32:33.412
Yeah. And it's Friday, Mom.

32:34.713 --> 32:36.047
Friday?

32:36.180 --> 32:38.717
Yeah. And I'm going camping
with some new friends

32:38.883 --> 32:39.917
in the morning.

32:41.119 --> 32:43.722
Maybe that's best for right now.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.923
Not the woods.

32:46.057 --> 32:49.093
No. This guy has a field
his grandpa owns.

32:49.227 --> 32:50.928
Kind of a hobby farm.

32:53.732 --> 32:56.535
I'm glad you and your father
had this hobby together.

32:57.703 --> 32:59.937
Make sure it stays
a hobby, okay?

33:00.938 --> 33:02.040
Okay.

33:29.401 --> 33:31.269
Quiet, Hewie.

33:33.004 --> 33:34.939
I said... I said be quiet.

33:38.577 --> 33:40.579
Be quiet, Hewie, knock it off.

33:43.749 --> 33:46.452
What's the matter?
It's not stormin'.

33:50.288 --> 33:51.989
Good boy.

33:52.123 --> 33:53.592
What's the matter?

33:53.692 --> 33:55.527
It isn't storming outside
or anything.

34:03.301 --> 34:05.637
If you're an animal,

34:05.804 --> 34:08.039
we're all one with
Mother Nature.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.646
And if you're a burglar, I...

34:14.813 --> 34:19.518
don't believe I own anything
on a material frame.

34:46.678 --> 34:48.045
<i>That night,</i>

34:48.179 --> 34:50.313
<i>I had one of
the most vivid dreams</i>

34:50.416 --> 34:52.351
<i>I can ever remember.</i>

34:53.385 --> 34:57.689
<i>There was this creature roaming
the fields near the forest.</i>

34:57.856 --> 34:59.892
<i>It was hairy like an ape.</i>

35:00.258 --> 35:03.695
<i>And somehow, I knew that
it was part of the reason</i>

35:03.829 --> 35:05.997
<i>why my dad had disappeared.</i>

35:07.231 --> 35:10.201
<i>I felt like it was trying
to tell me something.</i>

35:11.235 --> 35:14.005
<i>But I just couldn't understand.</i>

36:25.777 --> 36:28.780
Dad, what's going on?

37:05.450 --> 37:07.386
Ricky? Ricky, are you there?

37:07.519 --> 37:09.320
<i>I'm here, but I lost him.</i>

37:09.454 --> 37:11.222
<i>He bolted when
the storm started.</i>

37:11.356 --> 37:13.692
Ricky, you gotta be careful!

37:23.569 --> 37:25.037
You need to find somewhere safe.

37:25.169 --> 37:26.905
This sounds like it's gonna
be a really bad one.

37:27.039 --> 37:28.540
<i>Solid advice, good buddy.</i>

37:28.674 --> 37:30.576
- <i>You should do the same.</i>
- I'll be okay.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.344
I hijacked your tent.

37:32.477 --> 37:35.347
<i>Hey, you know that cave
on the east side?</i>

37:35.480 --> 37:37.349
- Yeah.
- <i>Well,</i>

37:37.482 --> 37:38.984
<i>I must have traveled
further than that</i>

37:39.083 --> 37:40.919
<i>because I'm right
in front of it.</i>

37:41.053 --> 37:42.821
You better be careful.
There might be something

37:42.921 --> 37:45.323
way more dangerous than
this storm inside there.

37:45.424 --> 37:47.526
<i>I'm already inside...</i>

37:47.693 --> 37:49.027
You gotta be more careful!

37:49.193 --> 37:50.329
<i>Okay, Mom.</i>

37:50.429 --> 37:52.064
You're lucky you have me
looking out for you.

37:52.196 --> 37:54.399
<i>Calm down.</i>

37:54.533 --> 37:56.401
<i>You know I appreciate it.</i>

37:57.002 --> 37:58.537
<i>Just stay put</i>

37:58.704 --> 38:01.205
<i>and I'll make my way back there
after this blows over.</i>

38:01.373 --> 38:04.876
Don't worry, I have no
intention of going anywhere.

38:27.966 --> 38:29.368
Give me five to keep me alive.

38:31.235 --> 38:33.739
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

38:33.905 --> 38:36.273
Just be cool,
and I'll give you a marshmallow.

38:36.408 --> 38:37.909
I've even brought pink ones.

38:38.043 --> 38:40.244
Do I look like I eat a lot
of pink marshmallows?

38:40.412 --> 38:42.246
Marshmallows?
What are you doing with those?

38:42.347 --> 38:44.549
We're supposed to be camping,
aren't we?

38:44.650 --> 38:45.917
Yeah, fake camping.

38:46.084 --> 38:47.552
Gotta make it real.

38:47.653 --> 38:50.756
The A-Team you aren't. Come on.

38:50.889 --> 38:52.591
You got it?

38:52.758 --> 38:54.291
Don't leave home without it.

39:10.108 --> 39:12.276
Do you want me to drive you
clear around here?

39:12.444 --> 39:14.680
Yeah, these woods is
a couple of acres.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.548
But if you drive us to
the farthest point,

39:16.682 --> 39:19.351
we can hike back and end up
somewhere near Cory's house.

39:19.484 --> 39:20.786
Better than starting at this end

39:20.919 --> 39:22.688
in the middle of nowhere.

39:22.821 --> 39:24.288
I've got a feeling we don't

39:24.423 --> 39:26.425
want to be stuck standing
there, waiting for him.

39:28.994 --> 39:30.362
How's your mom?

39:30.962 --> 39:32.497
She was asleep
when I left, but...

39:32.631 --> 39:35.801
all right considering
we haven't heard from my dad.

39:36.134 --> 39:39.137
Don't worry. We're gonna
do something about that.

39:43.375 --> 39:44.943
Hang on.

39:45.043 --> 39:47.646
Hang on, I think that car
was outside my house.

39:59.491 --> 40:00.792
Cory.

40:01.493 --> 40:03.294
They're after us.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.203
Have you ladies ever raced
for pink slips?

40:11.336 --> 40:12.504
Listen, sis...

40:41.366 --> 40:42.567
They're gaining.

40:43.201 --> 40:44.903
Oh no, they're not.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.928
Where are we, Bob?

41:43.094 --> 41:44.930
This used to be
an old logging road.

41:45.096 --> 41:46.665
Dad and his brothers
would come out here

41:46.798 --> 41:48.600
and hunt back in the old days.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.135
I never heard about that.

41:50.268 --> 41:52.137
You were too young
and I was just a girl.

41:52.270 --> 41:54.105
Word is there hasn't been
any wild game out here

41:54.239 --> 41:56.441
for a while now.
Funny, isn't it?

41:59.277 --> 42:01.012
Actually, I think this is gonna
to work pretty well.

42:01.146 --> 42:03.281
I think this puts us
on the far side of the woods

42:03.448 --> 42:05.917
before it turns into
a highway frontage road.

42:06.017 --> 42:07.686
What do you think?

42:07.819 --> 42:09.354
It'll work.

42:48.226 --> 42:51.196
Ricky? Ricky, where are you?

42:51.330 --> 42:53.332
Damn.

42:53.465 --> 42:55.000
I'm really worried about you.

42:55.166 --> 42:56.668
You're the only friend I have
and the only one

42:56.835 --> 42:59.004
who gives a damn about me.
Please, Ricky, answer!

43:06.511 --> 43:07.746
I'm exhausted.

43:07.879 --> 43:09.547
I need to get some rest.

43:09.681 --> 43:11.082
But I'll keep my...

43:11.216 --> 43:14.552
keep my ears on
in case you need to contact me.

44:13.078 --> 44:14.079
You ready?

44:14.212 --> 44:16.449
Yeah, thanks.

44:26.591 --> 44:28.760
Yeah, well,
if I don't see you doofuses

44:28.927 --> 44:31.430
in front of your house
at this time tomorrow morning,

44:31.563 --> 44:33.898
the shenanigans are over
and I'm calling the cops.

44:33.999 --> 44:35.567
Way to be a narc, Bob.

44:35.667 --> 44:37.769
Just be safe little bro,
all right?

44:37.902 --> 44:39.270
All right, all right.

44:39.438 --> 44:41.340
I don't like having to be
the mom, and the dad,

44:41.474 --> 44:43.174
and the big sister,
and the driver,

44:43.308 --> 44:44.609
and everything else.

44:44.776 --> 44:46.479
All right,
I heard you loud and clear.

44:57.456 --> 44:59.924
So you're sure that movie was
shot out here somewhere?

45:00.025 --> 45:01.793
You're asking me that now?

45:01.960 --> 45:03.028
Yeah, you can tell.

45:03.161 --> 45:04.497
Somewhere out here.

45:07.132 --> 45:08.800
Anywhere out here.

45:09.335 --> 45:11.337
So long as it's not
nowhere out here.

45:12.637 --> 45:14.706
So you think your dad would
have come out here?

45:14.839 --> 45:18.543
Yeah, because I would,
and we're a lot alike.

45:19.144 --> 45:21.046
I'm eager to meet your dad then.

46:06.224 --> 46:08.494
You ain't from around here.

46:09.194 --> 46:10.195
I'm a state worker.

46:12.331 --> 46:14.032
Thought so.

46:14.199 --> 46:16.768
Locals don't come around here.

46:16.901 --> 46:18.937
Well, you're out here.

46:22.273 --> 46:23.775
We're hunting.

46:25.210 --> 46:26.512
As far as I know,

46:26.611 --> 46:28.046
there's nothing
in season right now.

46:30.048 --> 46:32.351
Well, what we're hunting for...

46:33.552 --> 46:35.220
is always in season.

46:36.788 --> 46:39.592
You best get back
to where you was parked.

46:45.096 --> 46:46.599
Yeah, well...

46:47.232 --> 46:48.867
I was done anyway.

46:50.068 --> 46:51.570
Yeah.

47:45.491 --> 47:47.292
Come on, come on.

47:50.295 --> 47:52.096
Damn!

47:53.765 --> 47:55.334
Ugh!

48:20.392 --> 48:21.360
Ricky?

48:29.968 --> 48:31.236
Ricky, are you there?

48:43.214 --> 48:45.149
Holy crap!

50:15.840 --> 50:18.477
I can see how my dad
got hooked on this place.

50:18.610 --> 50:20.612
I really like it out here.

50:20.746 --> 50:24.248
I remember you said you never
joined Girl Scouts though.

50:24.616 --> 50:28.520
Uniforms, not my color.

50:28.654 --> 50:30.522
Hey guys, stop.

50:30.656 --> 50:31.956
You hear anything?

50:34.793 --> 50:35.993
No.

50:36.127 --> 50:37.629
Does I tell you anything?

50:37.796 --> 50:40.799
No birds, no animals, nothing.

50:41.467 --> 50:43.802
Don't forget what
this place is, guys.

50:50.308 --> 50:52.811
So who owns all this land?

50:52.977 --> 50:55.514
Now, who knows.

50:55.647 --> 50:57.649
Story goes 20, 30 years ago,

50:57.816 --> 50:59.351
some local guy who was
a Korean War vet

50:59.485 --> 51:01.353
and his Korean wife
bought it all.

51:01.487 --> 51:03.321
There was a lot of
prejudice back then

51:03.489 --> 51:05.491
and they just kept
to themselves.

51:05.624 --> 51:06.991
Plus, I heard he was
scarred up pretty bad

51:07.158 --> 51:09.193
from the Battle of
the Chosin Reservoir.

51:09.561 --> 51:11.162
They have any kids?

51:11.563 --> 51:12.964
Don't know why.
I think there's some sort of

51:13.064 --> 51:14.733
half Korean Boo Radley
I hear something.

51:14.867 --> 51:18.169
Just never heard that part
of the story before.

51:18.504 --> 51:20.839
So there's
a homestead somewhere.

51:20.972 --> 51:22.173
A what?

51:25.811 --> 51:28.079
If the woods are so quiet,
then what was that?

51:28.212 --> 51:29.815
It wasn't small.

51:33.585 --> 51:35.354
What was that?

51:35.487 --> 51:37.556
It's maybe what
we came here for.

51:46.331 --> 51:47.932
Y'all just peed down your legs!

51:48.065 --> 51:50.369
- What the hell, man?
- We're out in the wild now.

51:50.536 --> 51:52.203
Time to do this man to man.

51:52.371 --> 51:54.440
Since you already got whooped
by two girls.

51:54.907 --> 51:57.676
9What, you guys wanna go
all Lord of the Flies?

51:57.776 --> 51:59.344
We don't like heavy metal.

51:59.445 --> 52:02.013
You're acting like these guys
know how to read, man.

52:06.351 --> 52:08.052
There's something about you
two guys and big sticks

52:08.186 --> 52:09.954
that you maybe
need to think about.

52:11.690 --> 52:13.191
- What?
- Hey look, your girlfriend

52:13.291 --> 52:15.894
brought a leaf to a stick fight.

52:16.595 --> 52:18.229
It's not a leaf,

52:18.363 --> 52:19.364
it's poison ivy.

52:19.465 --> 52:21.900
- What?
- Oh, man!

52:24.770 --> 52:26.037
What can I say?

52:26.137 --> 52:27.573
She's smarter
and better looking.

52:27.706 --> 52:29.541
I'm batting out of my league.

52:32.109 --> 52:34.713
I wonder if that's
the last we'll see of them.

54:22.020 --> 54:24.155
You're getting jumpy.

54:24.255 --> 54:25.490
You shot too.

54:25.591 --> 54:27.559
Uh-huh.

55:07.065 --> 55:09.034
It's been through here.

55:17.776 --> 55:19.811
You're just rubbing it in,
dumbass.

55:19.945 --> 55:21.613
I need some water.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.117
You see a creek,
a stream, a wishing well?

55:25.249 --> 55:27.753
Just wait 'till we get home,
and quit touching it.

55:27.886 --> 55:29.488
What did you just say?

55:29.621 --> 55:31.423
Agh, damn it.

55:31.556 --> 55:33.592
That chick's some bad medicine.

56:10.261 --> 56:12.664
Seth! Seth!

56:13.532 --> 56:15.100
Seth!

56:17.803 --> 56:19.438
Ow!

56:20.472 --> 56:22.140
Seth!

56:22.306 --> 56:23.542
Seth!

56:23.675 --> 56:25.377
Sorry, bro.

56:25.510 --> 56:27.311
Oomph!

56:35.286 --> 56:37.288
Ah!

56:38.523 --> 56:39.825
They're just goofing.

56:39.958 --> 56:41.193
Buttheads.

56:50.836 --> 56:53.171
Y'all were told not to come.

58:30.468 --> 58:31.770
Hello?

58:31.903 --> 58:34.272
Is this... is this Cory's mom?

58:34.906 --> 58:36.241
Yes, who's this?

58:36.341 --> 58:39.110
I'm not trying to lay
an authority trip

58:39.277 --> 58:41.780
on you or anything, but, um...

58:41.947 --> 58:43.615
I'm a teacher
from Cory's school.

58:43.782 --> 58:46.484
I just wondered if, uh,
he and Boone were there?

58:46.952 --> 58:49.354
No, he's at Boone's.

58:49.754 --> 58:52.457
I already talked to Boone's dad.

58:52.624 --> 58:55.160
They were supposed
to be over there.

58:56.194 --> 58:57.996
Wh... what is this about?

58:59.631 --> 59:01.833
Some guys hit me over
the head last night

59:01.967 --> 59:03.635
and they went through
my stuff...

59:04.936 --> 59:07.038
my film stuff.

59:08.940 --> 59:10.976
Film... film stuff?

59:11.142 --> 59:13.879
Yeah, like uh,
what those kids do

59:14.012 --> 59:16.314
in the film club at school.

59:17.616 --> 59:19.150
<i>Uh...</i>

59:19.317 --> 59:21.486
<i>I think they might be
in trouble.</i>

59:27.993 --> 59:29.895
Let me see your camera.

59:36.835 --> 59:38.169
Nice.

59:43.308 --> 59:45.477
You don't let me
use your camera.

59:56.821 --> 59:58.056
What?

59:58.189 --> 01:00:00.359
What if we're wrong?

01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:01.559
What do you mean?

01:00:01.693 --> 01:00:03.662
What if we're not
looking for monsters?

01:00:03.762 --> 01:00:06.164
What if bad people
did this to my dad?

01:00:13.772 --> 01:00:15.040
Cory?

01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:22.280
I think you may be wrong.

01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:52.777
Hey, buddy.

01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:54.746
Hey, buddy.

01:00:54.913 --> 01:00:56.581
We're all cool.

01:00:56.715 --> 01:00:58.984
Everybody's cool.

01:01:25.444 --> 01:01:27.746
It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:39.791 --> 01:01:40.859
No!

01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:56.775
There's no way that creature
hurt my dad or anybody else.

01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:59.144
Or plant a steel trap.

01:01:59.544 --> 01:02:00.311
Look.

01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:02.680
Fences are made by people.

01:02:02.814 --> 01:02:04.182
Also, keep some things in,

01:02:04.315 --> 01:02:05.683
some things out.

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:08.219
Follow a fence line,
you can find people,

01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:09.821
or where people lived.

01:02:10.622 --> 01:02:12.491
There's something at
the heart of these woods,

01:02:12.624 --> 01:02:14.793
and I think it might not be
the monster we're thinking.

01:02:17.796 --> 01:02:20.632
I'm Cory's mom.
We met the other day.

01:02:20.732 --> 01:02:22.000
You're Roberta?

01:02:22.133 --> 01:02:23.701
Yeah. Uh, well,

01:02:23.835 --> 01:02:26.704
the guys are probably
running around here somewhere.

01:02:27.339 --> 01:02:28.807
You think you're
protecting them,

01:02:28.907 --> 01:02:30.575
but you're not.

01:02:31.009 --> 01:02:32.677
He's my brother, but...

01:02:32.844 --> 01:02:35.013
it's always just kind
of been the two of us.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.681
I understand.

01:02:36.815 --> 01:02:38.850
But this is serious

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:40.553
and I really need your help.

01:02:45.857 --> 01:02:47.092
Look.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.830
It's gotta be the same guys that
tried to run us off the road.

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:53.832
What do you think they're
doing out here?

01:03:03.007 --> 01:03:05.110
Y'all got half a brain each.

01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:06.778
Together...

01:03:07.712 --> 01:03:11.049
still as dumb
as ice cream in an oven.

01:03:11.216 --> 01:03:13.352
What do you want with us?

01:03:14.386 --> 01:03:16.721
Use you as target practice.

01:03:18.022 --> 01:03:19.724
Multiple rounds.

01:03:22.227 --> 01:03:24.597
Shootin' kids is frowned upon,

01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:27.699
even when they're little
a-holes like yourselves.

01:03:29.368 --> 01:03:31.069
But you got's to learn
what happens

01:03:31.236 --> 01:03:33.204
when you try and cross us.

01:03:43.415 --> 01:03:44.983
More evidence.

01:03:45.116 --> 01:03:46.651
More evidence is right.

01:03:46.784 --> 01:03:48.753
We haven't even talked about
what we saw back there,

01:03:48.887 --> 01:03:50.088
and we have it on film.

01:03:50.255 --> 01:03:51.256
Yeah.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:52.790
Yeah, what?

01:03:52.924 --> 01:03:55.594
Let's just focus on
getting my dad back, okay?

01:04:03.268 --> 01:04:04.903
Leave these kids out of this.

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.507
It's too late.

01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:11.309
Just let them go.
I'll give you what you want.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.244
Better.

01:04:15.079 --> 01:04:17.616
Still too late.

01:04:19.784 --> 01:04:21.420
Besides...

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.789
these two teabags are picking on
your kid at school.

01:04:26.324 --> 01:04:27.593
Say we're doing y'all a favor.

01:04:27.692 --> 01:04:30.529
It doesn't matter.
Just let them go.

01:04:31.996 --> 01:04:34.165
Tell us where your film is.

01:04:34.299 --> 01:04:35.967
Think about it.

01:04:37.802 --> 01:04:39.338
In the basement.

01:04:43.975 --> 01:04:46.645
We stupid now, huh?

01:04:47.646 --> 01:04:49.714
We already looked there.

01:04:51.216 --> 01:04:53.652
A couple other places, too.

01:04:54.018 --> 01:04:55.186
Just tell 'em, mister.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.821
It's the truth.

01:04:57.322 --> 01:04:58.823
Maybe we did miss it.

01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:01.660
Then again...

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:05.997
maybe the kid brought it.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:07.165
Cory?

01:05:07.298 --> 01:05:08.500
Little boy scout

01:05:08.634 --> 01:05:10.636
out and about in the woods.

01:05:10.735 --> 01:05:12.671
Big hero,

01:05:12.837 --> 01:05:14.172
rescue his daddy.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.740
Not Cory.

01:05:16.975 --> 01:05:18.711
Tell you what,

01:05:18.843 --> 01:05:21.746
we're gonna go out there,
find him,

01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:25.850
have ourselves
a happy little reunion.

01:05:26.017 --> 01:05:27.252
No!

01:05:28.721 --> 01:05:30.321
That sounded like a gunshot.

01:05:30.422 --> 01:05:32.090
- Dad!
- Cory, no!

01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:38.430
Dad!

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.932
Stand down!

01:05:41.065 --> 01:05:42.334
Okay, okay.

01:05:42.434 --> 01:05:44.703
You said there'd be
a family reunion.

01:05:44.836 --> 01:05:45.770
You okay, son?

01:05:45.903 --> 01:05:46.904
I'm okay.

01:05:47.038 --> 01:05:48.374
Did you bring the film with you?

01:05:48.507 --> 01:05:49.675
What film?

01:05:49.774 --> 01:05:51.510
It doesn't matter, Cory.
It's over.

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:53.612
Yeah, I brought it with me.
I didn't want to leave it

01:05:53.746 --> 01:05:55.213
where anybody could find it.

01:05:55.381 --> 01:05:56.781
- Give it to these men.
- But Dad!

01:05:56.914 --> 01:05:59.551
Give it to these men
and they'll let us all go.

01:06:00.386 --> 01:06:01.620
Easy.

01:06:05.189 --> 01:06:06.525
You're not going in there.

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:07.892
He's my friend.

01:06:20.972 --> 01:06:22.374
For what it's worth, Dad,

01:06:22.474 --> 01:06:23.875
I know what you filmed
back then was real.

01:06:23.975 --> 01:06:26.878
I saw one of them.

01:06:28.714 --> 01:06:31.316
Y'all think that's why
we're doing this?

01:06:32.984 --> 01:06:34.285
Sure...

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.722
capturing them creatures
will make us famous.

01:06:37.889 --> 01:06:40.426
Where do you think
the money for all them traps

01:06:40.592 --> 01:06:43.662
and these guns
and all that's coming from, hmm?

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.398
This film of your dad's,

01:06:46.498 --> 01:06:49.267
the one shot in
the woods back then,

01:06:49.401 --> 01:06:51.603
I got me
some influential clients

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:53.137
who believe
it accidentally shows

01:06:53.271 --> 01:06:54.740
a chemical dumpsite.

01:06:55.507 --> 01:06:57.609
Even after all these years,

01:06:57.776 --> 01:07:00.446
this footage can still get
some folks in trouble.

01:07:01.145 --> 01:07:03.281
My brother always thought
there was something

01:07:03.449 --> 01:07:05.249
going on down on this land,

01:07:05.351 --> 01:07:08.587
and he and my sister-in-law
both died of cancer.

01:07:08.687 --> 01:07:10.955
- That was your brother?
- Yeah.

01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:12.990
And I should have come back
a long time ago

01:07:13.124 --> 01:07:14.258
and taken care of this.

01:07:15.126 --> 01:07:17.830
Now I've got you involved
and it's my biggest regret.

01:07:20.131 --> 01:07:21.467
Don't worry.

01:07:22.668 --> 01:07:24.803
Y'all see 'em soon enough.

01:07:54.165 --> 01:07:56.835
Dad, this is my best
friend, Boone.

01:08:28.198 --> 01:08:29.535
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.942
<i>You there, good buddy?</i>

01:08:38.075 --> 01:08:40.446
Ricky! I'm so happy
to hear your voice.

01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:42.113
<i>The feeling's mutual.</i>

01:08:42.246 --> 01:08:44.081
<i>I couldn't get that walkie
to work for hours.</i>

01:08:44.215 --> 01:08:46.082
<i>Probably the storm
messing with it.</i>

01:08:46.216 --> 01:08:48.554
You wouldn't believe
the morning I've had.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.287
<i>If it's anything
like my night,</i>

01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:51.756
<i>I bet I would.</i>

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:53.926
I've been stalked by
wolves and Bigfoot!

01:08:54.058 --> 01:08:56.795
<i>I think you may
have that wrong.</i>

01:08:56.929 --> 01:08:58.863
- I do?
- <i>Yup. You see,</i>

01:08:58.962 --> 01:09:01.733
<i>those wolves were
out for my blood, too.</i>

01:09:01.867 --> 01:09:05.804
<i>Or maybe I took their shelter
from the storm.</i>

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:08.372
<i>All I know is they were
inching closer and closer,</i>

01:09:08.474 --> 01:09:10.742
<i>and they meant business.</i>

01:09:10.876 --> 01:09:12.911
This seems eerily familiar.

01:09:13.044 --> 01:09:14.645
<i>The next part
is really gonna</i>

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:16.080
<i>knock your socks off.</i>

01:09:16.247 --> 01:09:18.484
- Go on.
- <i>Well,</i>

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:20.752
<i>just when things
were the most grim,</i>

01:09:20.919 --> 01:09:22.754
<i>that Bigfoot stepped
into the light</i>

01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:25.724
<i>and let loose with
the most unnatural growl</i>

01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:27.826
<i>I have ever heard.</i>

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.094
<i>Those wolves scattered
in all four directions</i>

01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:33.096
<i>and old Foot chased
after some of 'em.</i>

01:09:33.264 --> 01:09:35.767
<i>The night was quiet
as can be after that,</i>

01:09:35.934 --> 01:09:37.435
<i>minus the storm, that is.</i>

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:40.071
Well, at least we know what
happened to those wolves.

01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:42.674
<i>And our hairy
hero as well.</i>

01:09:42.808 --> 01:09:44.443
I was totally wrong about him,

01:09:44.576 --> 01:09:45.844
- that's for sure.
- <i>I mean,</i>

01:09:45.978 --> 01:09:47.479
<i>who could blame you?</i>

01:09:47.613 --> 01:09:49.113
<i>He has got sort of a bad rap</i>

01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:51.082
- <i>in all the books we read.</i>
- True.

01:09:51.182 --> 01:09:52.850
I still wish I could
thank him, though.

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:55.587
<i>Maybe someday
you'll get a chance.</i>

01:09:55.687 --> 01:09:57.288
Come on, Ricky,
what are the chances

01:09:57.456 --> 01:09:58.991
- we'll ever see Bigfoot again?
- <i>About the same</i>

01:09:59.123 --> 01:10:00.826
<i>as seeing him
in the first place.</i>

01:10:00.959 --> 01:10:02.528
I hope you're right.

01:10:02.661 --> 01:10:04.429
<i>So now what?</i>

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:06.197
Head home soon, I guess,

01:10:06.331 --> 01:10:08.834
back where the monsters are
never friendly.

01:10:08.967 --> 01:10:10.836
<i>I wish our new friend
could help you there.</i>

01:10:10.969 --> 01:10:12.938
Me too, but such is life.

01:10:13.037 --> 01:10:14.840
- What about you?
- <i>I'm gonna check out</i>

01:10:14.973 --> 01:10:16.642
<i>this footage. With this stuff,</i>

01:10:16.808 --> 01:10:18.810
<i>we may have the next Jaws
on our hands.</i>

01:10:18.977 --> 01:10:20.612
Man, I can't wait
to see what you got!

01:10:20.712 --> 01:10:22.648
<i>I'll contact you
later tonight.</i>

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:25.283
<i>Same bad time, same bad channel.</i>

01:10:25.384 --> 01:10:26.351
You know it!

01:10:26.485 --> 01:10:27.486
<i>Great.</i>

01:10:27.619 --> 01:10:28.987
<i>On that note,</i>

01:10:29.153 --> 01:10:30.656
<i>over and out, good buddy.</i>

01:10:30.822 --> 01:10:31.990
Okay, I'll give you one:

01:10:32.156 --> 01:10:33.992
over and out.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.243
<i>Will? Will!</i>

01:10:52.377 --> 01:10:53.512
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:10:53.645 --> 01:10:55.079
<i>Come in, good buddy.</i>

01:10:55.212 --> 01:10:56.815
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:10:57.382 --> 01:10:58.750
<i>Don't worry, good buddy.</i>

01:10:58.884 --> 01:11:01.720
<i>Everything's gonna be all right.</i>

01:11:02.521 --> 01:11:04.356
Cory!

01:11:08.192 --> 01:11:09.394
Cory?

01:11:12.163 --> 01:11:14.366
This is where I dropped them
off this morning, ma'am.

01:11:14.499 --> 01:11:16.702
I'm not sure which way
they went from here.

01:11:20.171 --> 01:11:21.673
Cory!

01:11:25.344 --> 01:11:26.277
Cory!

01:11:34.353 --> 01:11:35.621
Cory!

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:37.356
Will!

01:11:47.733 --> 01:11:50.201
We made it and we got to film.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.240
Hey, man.

01:11:56.808 --> 01:11:58.710
No. Just...

01:12:01.613 --> 01:12:02.748
No.

01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:12.457
<i>Maybe you think I was crazy</i>

01:12:12.591 --> 01:12:14.660
<i>for destroying that film.</i>

01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:16.728
<i>Heck, maybe I am crazy.</i>

01:12:17.596 --> 01:12:19.398
<i>Maybe you have to be
a little crazy to ruin</i>

01:12:19.498 --> 01:12:24.436
<i>the only documented footage
of an actual Sasquatch.</i>

01:12:24.569 --> 01:12:25.971
<i>All I know is</i>

01:12:26.104 --> 01:12:28.507
<i>that monster saved our lives.</i>

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.844
<i>The least I could give it
was privacy.</i>

01:12:32.978 --> 01:12:35.447
<i>We never told anyone
about the creature.</i>

01:12:36.114 --> 01:12:38.917
<i>Well, not until right now,
that is.</i>

01:12:39.017 --> 01:12:42.286
<i>So I hope you can keep a secret.</i>

01:13:01.125 --> 01:13:06.125
