WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:05.588
(door closes)

00:12.887 --> 00:16.349
<i>Councilman Wade stated</i>
<i>that he was acting in self-defense...</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:18.143
Why don't you just turn the sound off?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.479
Figure you're going to get your dose
of Mr. Wade at the office?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.648
<i>I felt I had no other choice but to--</i>

00:24.149 --> 00:26.526
The only other choice
is <i>Sesame Street,</i> Furillo.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.361
Well, let's see what Big Bird is up to.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.822
-(knocking on door)
-It's Sid!

00:32.574 --> 00:33.408
It's open.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.414
Norm, what happened?

00:39.706 --> 00:40.957
Huh, what does it look like?

00:41.207 --> 00:42.667
Oh, no, it's true?

00:42.751 --> 00:44.961
Teddy Falco clipped your finger?

00:45.045 --> 00:47.756
-It's true.
-Oh, jeez,

00:47.839 --> 00:49.758
-but they reattached it?
-Yeah.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.009
Where'd you go, County?

00:51.092 --> 00:54.179
-(mutters) Mercy.
-I don't even believe it.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.765
I'm down at Jerry's Coffee half-hour ago,

00:56.848 --> 00:59.184
Sal Feruggi,
a little guy with all the hair,

00:59.267 --> 01:01.811
says to me,
"Your cop got his finger clipped."

01:01.895 --> 01:05.774
I said, "Excuse me, Sal, my cop?
Do you mind explaining that to me?"

01:05.857 --> 01:09.486
He says to me, "Your cop, Sid.
I mean, who are you kidding?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.446
Everybody knows you snitch
for Lieutenant Buntz."

01:11.529 --> 01:14.324
I say, "Oh, really?
Well, forgive me, Sally.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.202
I happen to be the one person
who doesn't know that."

01:17.285 --> 01:19.788
-Hey, uh, give me a hand here, will you?
-Sure.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.999
Anyways, Sal's talking to Nicky Myrtle.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.795
Nicky Myrtle happens to be
at the Empire Expresso, 3:00 this morning.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.882
He says he hears Teddy Falco
clipped Lieutenant Buntz's finger.

01:30.965 --> 01:34.469
-Give me a hand with my jacket.
-Sure.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.348
-Anyways--
-Take it easy, now, all right?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.225
Slow, Norm, slow.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.768
-Here, here. Here.
-All right.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.229
Ow. Ow. Okay.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.607
Anyways, I say, "Forgive me, Sally.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.609
The reason I can't believe your story

01:49.692 --> 01:52.695
is that it doesn't end with
"So, then, Lieutenant Buntz

01:52.779 --> 01:55.573
uses Teddy Falco
to repave the Dekker Projects,"

01:55.657 --> 02:00.245
but now I get here,
I look, I see it's true.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.538
Sid, please, huh?

02:03.790 --> 02:06.251
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Yes.

02:06.876 --> 02:07.836
Looks like it would.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.048
What are you looking for, your keys?
Where do you usually keep them?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.424
Don't help me, Sid, all right?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.552
Will you leave my stuff alone?
Go on and get out of here.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.178
-Can you drive?
-Yes, I can drive.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.098
It's an automatic. I can handle it.
Just go on. Go on. Get out.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.474
Oh. Oh.

02:22.308 --> 02:26.104
Well, excuse the hell
out of me for caring, Norm.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.522
-(drawer slams)
-Oh, Norm!

02:27.605 --> 02:30.942
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

02:31.025 --> 02:32.318
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:36.281
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

02:36.364 --> 02:37.782
(sirens wailing)

02:43.496 --> 02:46.541
(theme music playing)

04:33.481 --> 04:34.983
I'm just a country boy, Frank.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.403
To me a war against crack
sounds like something

04:38.486 --> 04:41.197
a police department
might be able to get behind.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.574
A guy who's making it go sounds like

04:43.658 --> 04:45.660
someone I'd have wanted
to be in harness with,

04:46.327 --> 04:47.620
but not us, right, Frank?

04:48.663 --> 04:51.916
"Councilman Shoots Drug Dealer
In Van Buren Corridor."

04:52.000 --> 04:53.126
How are we positioned?

04:53.668 --> 04:54.919
"Police investigate shooting."

04:55.003 --> 04:57.755
That's our job, Chief. Where there's
a shooting, we investigate.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.424
You're an alchemist, Furillo.

05:00.174 --> 05:03.720
You convert Bill Wade

05:03.803 --> 05:06.347
from this department's ally
into its blood enemy.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.142
And now, poof!
You want to turn him into a martyr.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.769
By some accounts, the man Wade shot
was running away from him.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.605
-By some accounts he wasn't.
-You mean the councilman's press aid?

05:14.689 --> 05:16.357
I mean a reputable citizen

05:16.441 --> 05:18.651
who's given a sworn
corroborative statement--

05:18.735 --> 05:21.404
Which Detectives LaRue
and Washington duly recorded.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.947
They've just about finished
their casework.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.950
Washington recognized another possible
witness running away from the scene

05:26.034 --> 05:27.243
whose statement they're trying to get.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.162
The DA will then decide how to proceed.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.164
Just us chickens, Frank.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.625
You know there isn't a chance in hell
for the DA to prosecute Wade.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.711
-That'll be his decision.
-Sorry.

05:37.628 --> 05:42.467
Had this lunatic idea
that we might be a little forthcoming,

05:43.092 --> 05:45.928
use this to, uh, build a few bridges.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.807
Bill, you all right?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.477
It's no picnic
being treated like a criminal,

05:52.560 --> 05:54.479
but, yes, I'm all right.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.772
Is he really all right?

05:56.606 --> 05:57.690
Bill's a fighter.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.193
Of course, it takes its toll.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.695
The captain has promised
to clear things up

06:02.779 --> 06:04.280
as expeditiously as possible.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.492
I want the councilman
to be given every consideration, Frank.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.286
Damn heroic. Damn brave.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.127
I remembered a few more things
about last night, Captain,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.588
as soon as I sat down, cleared my head.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.923
You have a right to add to your statement.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.675
-He can amend?
-He can add to.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.427
His original statement
remains on the record.

06:26.511 --> 06:30.264
The result ought to be
you exonerate me from any wrongdoing.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.351
We don't exonerate anybody
around here, Councilman.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.770
We just turn over our findings
to the district attorney.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.564
Captain, when was the last time
someone threatened your life,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.109
and you could see in his eyes
he was about to blow you away?

06:41.192 --> 06:42.944
Because that's what happened
to me last night.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.446
I know your position
is that you shot in self-defense.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.949
With a registered firearm to save my life.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.952
It isn't a position.
It's what happened. I was there.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.829
I'm a big boy, Councilman.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.874
Whatever the factual circumstances
when you shot that dealer last night,

06:56.958 --> 06:58.626
I know there's little chance
of you being charged.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.253
You just let us finish our jobs.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.967
Then you can do what you want
about capitalizing on the results.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.302
Neal, JD.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.849
Councilman wants to add to his statement.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.060
Whatever you say, Captain,
but all he's gonna do is shine us on.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.479
Yeah, Captain, why don't we
just go find the last witness?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.273
-Mouse?
-Yeah, we bring in Mouse,

07:20.356 --> 07:23.651
Wade and Mars dispute his statement,
DA declines prosecution,

07:23.734 --> 07:25.403
and we go on to something useful.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.489
Then go find your witness
after you take the councilman's statement.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.574
Councilman.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.034
You want to add to your statement, too?

07:32.535 --> 07:33.536
Not necessary.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.081
Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.208
How you doin', Sister?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.002
Wonderful, Detective LaRue.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.046
-Good morning.
-Sister.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.591
-Good morning, Sister.
-Good morning, Patrick.

07:46.674 --> 07:50.011
Are you ready to help St. Cecilia's
find its outreach center?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.304
Let's do it.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.473
Officers.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.102
What's wrong with that picture, huh?

07:59.353 --> 08:00.480
Two-eleven, ladies.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.524
What are you looking at, Sarge?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.444
I was just noticing
that despite her habit and piety,

08:06.527 --> 08:11.199
Sister Chastity has retained
Grace Gardner's carriage and gait.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.367
You noticed that, huh?

08:13.659 --> 08:17.705
Well, it's a distinctively feminine
sort of fluidity of movement.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.749
Could we have the call slip, Sarge?

08:20.833 --> 08:21.792
Oh, of course. Sorry.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.591
Now, let me get this straight, Councilman.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.886
You're saying
that the man you shot, Angel,

08:32.303 --> 08:36.557
whispered these words in your ear,
"I got a gun in my pocket.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.727
If you don't give me your money,
I'm gonna blow a hole in your stomach"?

08:39.810 --> 08:40.728
That's correct, Detective.

08:40.811 --> 08:45.066
Is it possible he also might have told you
the caliber of the gun, Councilman?

08:45.149 --> 08:47.235
Like, uh, did he say anything like, uh,

08:47.693 --> 08:50.821
"I got a .44 magnum pistol in my pocket"?

08:50.905 --> 08:52.156
Very humorous.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.244
Look, Detective, could both you
and Mr. Mars excuse us for a second?

09:02.959 --> 09:07.171
Detective, perhaps I seem rude
or overbearing sometimes,

09:07.255 --> 09:08.172
and I'm sorry about that,

09:08.256 --> 09:11.676
but this is a-a deeply
trying experience for me.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.010
I understand that it must be.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.179
-It's kind of crazy, actually.
-What is, Councilman?

09:15.263 --> 09:18.683
We're both on the same side here.
We shouldn't be adversaries.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.978
Now, I'm telling you the truth
about what happened, so help me,

09:22.562 --> 09:23.521
and as someone who was there,

09:23.604 --> 09:26.857
I plead with you to search
your own recollection carefully.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.695
Now, you say you didn't see
the shooting incident itself?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.530
-That's right.
-Are you absolutely sure?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.031
You didn't see that man whisper in my ear?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.783
You didn't see him
gesture towards his pocket?

09:35.866 --> 09:37.285
I mean, I've remembered things overnight

09:37.368 --> 09:39.537
I didn't recall
in the immediate aftermath.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.292
Can't say I remembered anything
more overnight, Councilman.

09:45.793 --> 09:46.627
All right.

09:48.879 --> 09:49.964
I'm sorry about that.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.179
-Captain.
-FRANK: Norm.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.265
I heard you lost a finger.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.809
Uh, that shylock Falco.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.103
(clears throat)
Then I had another accident this morning.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.146
Will you have use of it?

10:05.229 --> 10:07.398
I don't know.
I gotta go in for more sewing.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.608
Look, why don't you take the day?

10:08.691 --> 10:11.027
I mean, we can postpone
on your loan shark busts.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.153
I'd rather work, Captain.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.780
I can get the warrants ready
while I'm at the ER.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.408
-When did we schedule the arrests?
-4:00.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.286
Falco was the last guy
we were getting evidence on.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.246
We're moving in
on all five of these creeps.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.915
-And who's handling the Falco arrests?
-Me.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.251
Oh, no, wait a minute. Norm,
I don't think that's such a hot idea.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.712
Captain, the bastard cut my finger off.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.091
Look, suppose he falls and chips a tooth

10:34.175 --> 10:35.635
-while you were bringing him in.
-Captain, listen--

10:35.718 --> 10:38.346
Norm, you have history with him.
Could look like payback.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.139
Captain, I'm no dope.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.850
I understand this pop's
gonna be under a microscope.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.353
I just want the satisfaction
of taking him in.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.271
Fragile on the package, Norm.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.190
Fragile on the package.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.943
You know, even if he had a heart attack,
I'd be inclined to be suspicious.

10:53.569 --> 10:57.198
Hey, Captain,
acts of God, we draw the line, right?

10:58.115 --> 10:59.075
Mm, man.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.755
Rules, the car is approaching.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.925
As soon as you are sure
that he is pulling into the lot,

11:16.008 --> 11:17.593
you punch in the time ticket.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.638
Extra minute means
an extra half-hour charge.

11:20.721 --> 11:21.555
I understand.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.516
All right, you're handing
the driver his ticket,

11:23.599 --> 11:24.892
"How long you gonna be, sir?"

11:25.184 --> 11:26.519
The full days you put in the back.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.063
That way you can park the short stays
in front of them.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.065
-You with me so far?
-I'm with you.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.068
Attitude. I don't like any hot shots.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.070
Don't show me how good you are.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.447
My best employees are invisible.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.533
-The guys I never have to look at.
-Fine.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.244
All right, last, but most important.
Are you ready?

11:43.452 --> 11:46.247
-I'm ready.
-The seventh floor is off-limits.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.332
-What's on the seventh floor?
-Excuse me?

11:48.416 --> 11:49.834
You said the seventh floor was off limits.

11:49.917 --> 11:50.751
What am I doing right now?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.379
-Now?
-I'm looking at you.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.673
That means you're not being invisible!

11:56.006 --> 11:58.342
-I just wondered--
-Don't wonder! Disappear! Park!

12:00.886 --> 12:02.388
(horn honks)

12:15.818 --> 12:19.238
-Come on, pops. Up and at 'em.
<i>-♪ Just a gigolo ♪</i>

12:19.321 --> 12:22.074
Yeah, you know
where the men's shelter is, right?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.492
Over on Sheffield?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.495
I know. I thank you, Officer.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.789
-Hello, Sis.
-Hello.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.251
-Sister Chastity?
-Yes.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.963
Yeah, Jay Pickle, Salter Realty.
Don't arrest her, Officer.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.799
She's our first nibble
since the property came on the market.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.509
(chuckles) Come on.

12:49.810 --> 12:53.898
No dog and pony pitch, Sister.
The place more or less speaks for itself.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.649
You could say that.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.069
Look, I have clients
waiting at another listing.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.906
Take your time. If I'm not back
when you want to leave,

13:01.989 --> 13:04.366
-just lock the door behind you.
-Thank you, Mr. Pickle.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.369
Here, call if you have any questions.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.581
And, Sister,
if you can come up even 20 percent,

13:10.664 --> 13:12.249
I can show you
some listings don't need a thing

13:12.333 --> 13:13.834
except maybe a new coat of paint.

13:13.918 --> 13:14.752
Thank you.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.590
Well, I think this place
has definite possibilities,

13:19.673 --> 13:20.800
don't you, Patrick?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.552
Guess it's in the eye
of the beholder, Sister.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.553
MAN: Got some change?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.056
You know, we could make
the reception area there,

13:27.807 --> 13:30.559
and then divide the rest of the place
into counseling rooms.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.937
It'll take a little elbow grease.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.856
I'm going to get
the neighborhood children to help me.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.442
We're going to sanctify this place...

13:38.526 --> 13:40.402
-MAN: Please, don't hurt me.
-...with our own hands.

13:40.694 --> 13:41.862
Help! Help!

13:42.530 --> 13:43.364
Police officer!

13:47.701 --> 13:48.536
Yeah, I'm okay.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.831
You okay, Mr. Pickle?

13:52.289 --> 13:54.208
I just need a change of underwear.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.209
Sorry, Sister.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.795
I would have liked a chance
to talk to that man.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.089
-Would you come back, please?
-(laughs)

14:00.172 --> 14:03.259
Sister, that-- that lease figure
in the listings...

14:03.551 --> 14:05.970
-Yes?
-Yeah, cut it in half.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.180
Oh, how generous of you.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.558
Just call me when you want to sign
the papers, okay? Thanks.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.226
You don't want to sign a complaint,
Mr. Pickle?

14:12.309 --> 14:14.228
I just want to get out of here
with my life.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.065
Oh, my goodness! Oh!

14:18.607 --> 14:19.441
What's that for?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.319
For lowering my rent.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.699
Car.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.913
Toes. Definitely toes.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.665
You all right, cowboy?

14:34.748 --> 14:38.085
Yeah, yeah, I was just thinking
the best place for old Buntz

14:38.168 --> 14:40.296
to start on that loan shark
is in the toe area.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.007
Toe is highly underrated.
You lop off a couple of toes,

14:43.090 --> 14:44.842
a guy just falls flat
right down on his face.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.176
-Hey, wait a minute.
-You-you mean

14:46.260 --> 14:49.138
if a guy chopped off your finger,
you'd hack his toes?

14:49.221 --> 14:50.890
Yeah. No, no.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.351
No, I don't know, but I'd have to do
some damage to his anatomy.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.644
-Over here, Andy.
-I don't know what you're talking about!

14:55.728 --> 14:56.979
You know what I'm talking about.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.189
You took my case, kid, and I want it!

14:59.273 --> 15:00.941
The case that was in the car!
Now what are you doing in my car?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.443
I don't know nothing about the case!

15:02.526 --> 15:04.278
(overlapping chatter)

15:04.612 --> 15:05.905
-Okay, okay.
-I didn't take it!

15:05.988 --> 15:07.072
What's the problem here?

15:07.948 --> 15:11.869
Hi, Officer.
I'm Al Sanderson. I'm a shirt salesman.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.746
I work very hard for my money.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.540
My partner and I, we, uh,
we parked our car over here.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.917
I went across the street
to have some breakfast.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.212
When I came back, this, uh,
this gentleman was sitting in my car.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.297
My sample case was missing.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.424
I was just listening to the radio.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.885
If I took his case,
why would I be sitting in the car?

15:27.968 --> 15:29.178
Because you already stashed it already!

15:29.261 --> 15:31.680
You're gonna be selling it
sometime tonight on the street corner!

15:31.764 --> 15:33.265
Al's just a little excitable, that's all.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.727
-And what is your name, sir?
-Joel Hirschman. I work with Al.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.938
Hey, look here, sir.
Do you think he stole it?

15:39.021 --> 15:39.897
No, I don't believe he did.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.900
He was in the car, yeah.
You see, the kid's my cousin.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.903
Now, he used to have a record,
used to have a drug problem,

15:45.986 --> 15:47.154
but he's been working out fine here.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.366
Look, if he's your cousin,
tell him to give me my case back,

15:50.449 --> 15:51.492
and we'll let it go at that.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.828
Now, he says he did not take it.
Do you want to proffer charges?

15:54.912 --> 15:59.041
No, I don't want to proffer charges!
All I want is my case back!

16:00.125 --> 16:02.086
Look, Officer, if I proffer charges,

16:02.169 --> 16:04.129
I'm gonna be tied up all day
with this, uh...

16:06.090 --> 16:08.717
Okay. I get it.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.013
You want to shake me down?
Okay, you did it.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.932
Now, here. Here. Here's 50 bucks.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.434
Now, go out and buy yourself some reefer
or whatever it is you people do.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.062
Get that man away from me. I'll cut him.
I swear I'll cut him!

16:20.145 --> 16:22.523
Take this money, okay?
I just want my case.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.191
Look, sir, you got two choices:

16:24.274 --> 16:26.443
you either come with us
or you drop the whole thing.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.862
Oh, for cryin' out loud. Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

16:28.946 --> 16:31.782
-I don't care what it's gonna cost you.
-Do you want me to come along?

16:31.865 --> 16:32.700
-No!
-No!

16:33.242 --> 16:35.536
-I didn't take it!
-Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

16:36.161 --> 16:38.580
(horn honks, tires squeal)

16:38.664 --> 16:41.208
Hey, give me the keys
to that Olds over there.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.585
-What Olds?
-The gray one in the back.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.463
-Where you taking it?
-What are you, writing a book?

16:46.547 --> 16:47.673
If the owner comes back,

16:47.756 --> 16:49.883
I want to be able to tell him
where his car is.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.885
Look, this is an all-day parker, right?

16:51.969 --> 16:53.012
-Right.
-Right.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.055
So by the time the guy comes for his car,

16:55.139 --> 16:57.307
I'll have it right back
where you parked it,

16:57.391 --> 16:59.351
all wrapped up and ready to go.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.813
I guess it's not my place
to ask what's going on.

17:02.896 --> 17:03.856
You got it.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.899
I bet it's going to the seventh floor.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.444
You know what you want to do, smart stuff?

17:09.737 --> 17:12.156
You want to relax, enjoy the quiet.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.825
About five minutes,
it's gonna be the lunch-hour rush,

17:14.908 --> 17:18.328
and you won't have time
to ask anybody any questions.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.166
NEAL: Gotta get Mouse, lover.
Let's head over there.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.838
-There, J.D., it's him.
-(siren wails)

17:39.099 --> 17:40.476
Where the hell did he go, Neal?

17:51.487 --> 17:53.197
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

17:54.615 --> 17:56.033
Hey, lookit here.

17:56.116 --> 17:59.369
Well, look, Neal. We trapped a Mouse.
Come on.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.788
Let me go, man!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.586
Interesting. Very unusual.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.380
Your friend Mr. Merkur
had a very distinctive style.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.340
But?

18:11.423 --> 18:14.718
But out of control and too elitist.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.303
Where's the audience?

18:17.012 --> 18:19.473
You're the expert. You tell me.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.392
All right, I will. Read this.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.062
Out loud, okay?

18:28.565 --> 18:32.945
"Hill Street Cop:
Life in America's Roughest Precinct.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.073
By Henry Goldblume."

18:37.991 --> 18:39.493
You gotta be kidding. I'm no writer.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.121
No one's asking you
to be Harold Robbins, Lieutenant.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.957
Look, I saw you on TV.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.710
You were earnest, sincere,
yet tough when you had to be.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.506
A very appealing package,
and I bet you have the stories.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.925
Yeah, well, that I do have.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.803
So, take the recorder.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.930
Call me anytime you like.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.391
We'll work together on this.
What do you say?

19:04.685 --> 19:05.519
I'll think about it.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.273
I'm gonna call that other listing.

19:09.356 --> 19:13.026
I want to see everything within our range
before I sign any papers.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.029
Wait a minute. You won't take yes
for an answer, will you, Sister?

19:16.113 --> 19:19.032
I mean, that Mr. Pickle offered you
that place we saw before for a song.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.952
Well, if you can arrange
for a mugger to appear,

19:22.035 --> 19:24.037
perhaps we can get another discount.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.165
(both chuckle)

19:26.248 --> 19:27.207
(imitates chuckle)

19:28.917 --> 19:30.377
You gonna make another mugger appear?

19:30.460 --> 19:31.545
Give me a break.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.630
What's going on, Flaherty?

19:34.631 --> 19:35.465
What do you mean?

19:35.841 --> 19:39.052
-Between you and Sister Chastity.
-She's my assignment.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.345
You don't find it a little unusual

19:40.429 --> 19:42.514
that she gives you
so much personal attention?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.267
Come on. She told me I'm her project,

19:45.601 --> 19:48.145
and that she's gonna
bring me back to the fold.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.565
Oh, the fold.
Now, what fold would that be?

19:51.648 --> 19:52.858
The church.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.403
Sarge, what are you trying to say, hmm?

19:57.779 --> 20:00.324
Do you think Sister Chastity's
on the make?

20:00.782 --> 20:01.825
I don't know. No.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.660
I mean, 'cause I can't even believe

20:03.744 --> 20:06.246
that you're suggesting
the possibility that this could...

20:07.873 --> 20:09.124
I don't know what I'm suggesting, okay?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.251
I just find the whole thing
a little weird.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.256
Join the club.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.093
I'm heading back over to the hospital.
The damn thing's hanging on by a thread.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.678
Oh, you don't wanna linger over that.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.347
-Here, your warrants.
-Yeah.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.182
I'm gonna hand these out
over at the hospital,

20:25.265 --> 20:28.143
so, uh, send the detectives over
when they get here, all right.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.061
I understand.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.147
(reporters talking indistinctly)

20:36.026 --> 20:37.861
I have called this press conference

20:37.945 --> 20:40.781
in the very bowels of the whale,
Hill Street precinct,

20:40.864 --> 20:42.199
to reclaim my good name.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.035
Are you saying that the police
are trying to smear you, Councilman?

20:45.118 --> 20:46.954
I'm saying
they're certainly dragging their feet

20:47.037 --> 20:50.123
on what was clearly
a case of self-defense.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.210
I was attempting to dramatize
the deplorable condition

20:53.293 --> 20:55.504
which exists in the Van Buren corridor,

20:55.587 --> 20:57.547
which is by no means
the only sector of our city

20:57.631 --> 21:00.634
which is run by crack dealers
and other violent hoodlums.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.136
I was threatened,
and I responded appropriately.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.389
-You want me to stop this?
-No, let him have his say.

21:05.472 --> 21:09.017
I have fully cooperated
with Captain Furillo and his men,

21:09.101 --> 21:11.561
and yet they persist in this,
uh, witch hunt.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.065
Do you think Captain Furillo
is conducting a-a personal vendetta

21:15.148 --> 21:18.443
because you publicly criticized
his stand on the drug issue?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.321
Regretfully, I would
have to answer yes to that.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.200
Furthermore, I find it ironic,
highly ironic,

21:25.284 --> 21:28.161
that the chief investigating detective,
one Neal Washington,

21:28.245 --> 21:31.832
has himself a history
of codeine dependence.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.835
If you need proof,
I have his personnel records right here.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.128
That's all, Councilman.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.922
That's a reckless
and irresponsible statement.

21:39.006 --> 21:39.840
REPORTER: Well, is it true, Captain?

21:39.923 --> 21:41.842
Do you deny that your detective
has a drug problem?

21:41.925 --> 21:44.219
Neal Washington is totally fit for duty.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.554
Do you know that for a fact?

21:45.804 --> 21:48.181
Isn't it possible he was under
the influence of drugs last night,

21:48.265 --> 21:51.101
that his entire account of what happened
should be stricken from the records?

21:51.184 --> 21:53.186
I already answered that.
This news conference is over.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.480
Sergeant, would you like
to escort these people out, please?

21:55.564 --> 21:56.732
Where is Detective Washington?

21:56.815 --> 21:59.443
-Out doing his job.
-You can't ignore this, Captain.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.903
HOWARD: All right, you have your
statement, gentlemen, ladies.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.989
Thank you very, very...

22:04.740 --> 22:05.657
Where did you get that information?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.409
-That's my business.
-Wrong.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.454
Those are confidential police records
you obtained illegally,

22:10.537 --> 22:12.956
-which makes it my business.
-Good day, Captain.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.085
You know, all you had to do
was wait a little while,

22:17.544 --> 22:18.879
and you could have walked away
from all this,

22:18.962 --> 22:20.464
but you just couldn't, could you?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.980
You're Detective Mazzeo, right, from Polk?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.774
-Right.
-Here's your warrant for Longo.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.818
Remember, we process him
at Hill Street precinct.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.071
That goes for every shylock we bust today.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.698
Here, you get McGuire.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.992
That leaves Falco, who's mine.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.079
Uh, look, Lieutenant,
I can take Falco for you if you want.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.164
I mean, considering your surgery and all.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.082
I'll manage.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.585
Okay, these busts represent
three months' work.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.171
No screw-ups. All right?

23:02.339 --> 23:05.425
Good luck. Yeah.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.309
Norm, you seen the doctor yet?

23:15.310 --> 23:18.146
Yeah, but I decided to stick around
'cause I love the food so much.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.524
No, I haven't seen the doc yet, pea brain.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.025
Good. Good.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.361
Good? How would you like
a little of this throbbing, Sid?

23:24.444 --> 23:29.199
First off, I want to apologize again
for causing this latest duress.

23:29.282 --> 23:30.117
I'm touched.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.537
You see, you're still angry, Norm.
I understand. That's perfectly normal.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.330
But maybe what happened this morning

23:35.414 --> 23:37.207
is gonna end up
being a blessing in disguise.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.876
Maybe I'm gonna let you live
if you get out of here right now, Sid.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.712
Norm, you're very upset.
You're extremely uncomfortable.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.131
I'll tell you what I'd like you to do.

23:44.214 --> 23:48.385
Relax. Clear your head
'cause I have a very serious question

23:48.802 --> 23:51.054
-of a financial nature.
-Sid.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.932
Are you sure
you want your finger restitched?

23:54.015 --> 23:55.142
You got three seconds to beat it.

23:55.434 --> 23:59.312
$50,000, standard compensation
loss of limb.

23:59.396 --> 24:02.858
Norm, you pull out the stitches,
the tip falls off.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.277
Who is going to know? It's a lock.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.195
Three, two, one. Out. Come on.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.114
Fifty Gs minimum.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.533
With a good attorney,
we're talking possible retirement.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.161
Time's up, Sid.
Come on, listen, I got an idea.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.370
This money is so good,

24:15.454 --> 24:17.622
why don't we chop off
three of your fingers, all right?

24:17.706 --> 24:21.084
Hey, you're in a very violent mood.
I'd check your medication.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.002
Go on.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.421
(telephone ringing)

24:25.797 --> 24:29.468
Sat in the car, turned on the radio,
smoked a cigarette.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.928
-You never saw the sample case at all?
-No.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.515
Your cousin tells me you're doing a pretty
good job at the parking lot, Mark.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.808
You don't want to do

24:36.892 --> 24:38.685
-anything stupid, man.
-I know.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.106
Okay, I guess that's all.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.192
Stay out of other people's cars.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.443
Right.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.403
Now, what does it take to get out of here?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.281
Now, listen to me,
you insult my intelligence,

24:51.364 --> 24:52.491
and then you cost me my livelihood.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.576
RENKO: Please keep your voice down
to a decent level.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.952
-Thank you.
-Now what?

24:56.036 --> 24:58.788
We took Mr. Lewis' statement.
If we need him, we know where to find him.

24:58.872 --> 25:02.334
Perfect. You two guys are gems,
you know that?

25:02.959 --> 25:04.211
First you waste my entire day,

25:04.294 --> 25:07.547
then you take this, uh,
this thief's word over mine.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.299
Al! Al!

25:09.925 --> 25:12.219
-What are you doing here?
-I found it.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.803
-Found what?
-Your samples.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.931
You left your case at the motel.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.807
AL: What are you, crazy?
I turned that room upside down.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.935
It wasn't in the room, Al.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.937
They found it later
at the checkout counter.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.773
You must have forgotten it.
It's an easy mistake.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.483
BOBBY: My, my, my.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.944
Mr. Sanderson,
I think you owe this man an apology.

25:29.569 --> 25:33.907
(sighs) Yeah, well, here. Here's 50 bucks.

25:33.990 --> 25:34.824
Excuse me.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.579
That's beautiful, huh, Joel?

25:41.122 --> 25:44.584
I offer to make it right,
and the kid cops an attitude.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.669
It's typical.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.170
You got your case back.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.756
Why don't you go sell some shirts?

25:50.298 --> 25:52.008
Al, let's go.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.970
Got a witness
in the Wade shooting, Sergeant.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.388
I need an interrogation room.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.266
A is open.
The captain wants to see you, Detective.

26:01.351 --> 26:05.021
Yes, Chief, sure I'll call you,
as soon as I have anything to report.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.736
Found the witness, Captain.
J.D.'s got him in interrogation.

26:12.112 --> 26:12.946
Good work, Neal.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.950
Look, somehow, Councilman Wade
got a copy of your personnel record.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.326
He's gone public with your

26:18.410 --> 26:19.953
-codeine problem.
-What?

26:20.036 --> 26:22.122
He implied you might have been
on codeine last night,

26:22.205 --> 26:23.540
that it could have
impaired your judgement.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.292
Captain, I've been clean for two years.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.544
If you want, I'll even take
a urinalysis test right now.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.004
That won't be necessary.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.131
-You want me off the case?
-Absolutely not.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.049
Man, I can't believe this.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.635
I thought that whole thing was behind me.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.555
-How'd Wade get ahold of my records?
-We don't know that yet.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.557
It's gotta be somebody
in the station, doesn't it?

26:40.640 --> 26:41.516
It looks that way.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.144
Neal, is there anybody who would have
reason to do this to you?

26:44.227 --> 26:45.687
Can't think of anybody, Captain.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.564
Kinda makes you wonder
who your friends are, huh?

26:47.647 --> 26:48.982
Well, we're gonna find out who did it.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.067
Meantime, if you want to take a few days--

26:51.151 --> 26:53.570
Uh-uh, J.D.'s waiting for me
in interrogation, Captain.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.535
Last night, Mouse, remember?

27:01.119 --> 27:02.037
Last night?

27:02.912 --> 27:04.164
Yeah. Night.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.208
You know, when it gets all dark outside.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.420
Oh, scary.

27:11.671 --> 27:12.797
You were in the corridor.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.383
-You saw Councilman Wade and Angel, right?
-Oh, yeah.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.844
Yeah, yeah, I-I remember that.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.516
(laughing)
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, I can, man.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.769
Like, um, Angel...

27:27.062 --> 27:31.399
he was levitating maybe two or three
inches above the ground.

27:32.150 --> 27:36.613
And Councilman Wade,
he wants to float up there, too.

27:38.573 --> 27:39.949
But he can't do it.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.953
He can't get himself free from gravity.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.457
Man, white dudes got no liftoff power.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.713
-Calls for you, Detective.
-Thanks, Doris.

27:53.797 --> 27:57.133
-Witness have anything to say?
-Not about this planet, Captain.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.052
No way we can put him on the stand.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.722
-Three reporters called, J.D.
-Forget them, Neal.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.100
It looks bad if I don't talk to them.
Looks bad either way.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.601
The parasites will be onto something else

28:06.685 --> 28:07.727
-by tomorrow.
-Yeah, right.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.979
Melvin started updating the files
this morning.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.066
Under normal circumstances,
I would applaud his initiative,

28:13.149 --> 28:16.361
but given the events of the day--

28:16.444 --> 28:18.988
Captain. Captain.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.491
I heard you found the other dealer
from last night.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.744
You've done enough damage, Councilman.
I'm telling you right now, go home.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.621
If the man's made
incriminating statements,

28:26.705 --> 28:27.956
we've got a right to know.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.417
Hey, man, you had no right
to go digging in my files!

28:30.500 --> 28:31.876
-Easy, Neal.
-You wouldn't have done that

28:31.960 --> 28:32.919
if I had changed my report.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.088
-We're gonna nail you, you bastard.
-Come on.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.842
And you claim that this detective
can be an impartial investigator?

28:38.925 --> 28:40.385
Get out of here, Councilman. Now.

28:40.468 --> 28:41.678
The man threatened me.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.805
-Get your boss out of here.
-Let's go, Bill.

28:43.888 --> 28:44.723
WOMAN: Excuse me.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.852
Get Melvin.
Bring him into interrogation B.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.188
Oh, Phil...

28:56.443 --> 29:00.530
I never dreamed the feelings
could be so... strong.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.825
-(door opens and closes)
-(sighs)

29:06.536 --> 29:07.370
There you are.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.207
Ready to go, Sister?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.335
In a moment, Patrick.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.714
(coughs)

29:19.299 --> 29:20.592
What are you doing down here?

29:23.803 --> 29:24.721
Remembering.

29:27.974 --> 29:28.808
Remembering.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.192
And connecting with something

29:37.275 --> 29:39.611
that's been building up inside me
for two days.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.739
It's clear to me now, Patrick, that...

29:44.073 --> 29:46.576
there was a hidden design
in my returning here

29:46.659 --> 29:49.120
and in you becoming my liaison.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.957
I couldn't see it for what it was
until this morning.

29:54.667 --> 30:00.757
When I felt the warmth of your hard,
brave body against mine.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.842
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, Sister.

30:03.343 --> 30:08.014
It's been a test to see
if I could complete my novitiate year.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.891
-You can do it, Sister.
-No.

30:11.726 --> 30:13.353
You were sent to show me

30:14.020 --> 30:16.147
that I'm still too much of this world.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.319
The lure of the flesh
is too strong, Patrick.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.200
(sighs deeply)

30:28.827 --> 30:31.371
Oh, the bond is there.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.874
-Can you deny it?
-You're a nun.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.546
His will be done.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.344
No.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.305
I understand how this
could have happened, Melvin.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.559
There'd been a request
to cooperate with Councilman Wade,

30:52.642 --> 30:54.519
and you may have felt
turning over Washington's file

30:54.602 --> 30:56.896
was just another instance
of that sort of cooperation.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.232
Captain, I promise you it wasn't me!

30:59.315 --> 31:02.735
Mm. I suppose if we believe that, Melvin,

31:03.278 --> 31:05.989
next you'll be trying to sell us
some Florida swampland.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.742
Melvin, the only thing left
for you to decide

31:09.826 --> 31:11.244
is how this is going to end.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.330
I mean, either you can cooperate
by incriminating Wade,

31:14.414 --> 31:15.665
or you can keep on lying.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.500
That's the only choice you have left.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.253
It's your call, Melvin.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.172
Why don't you smarten up?

31:25.133 --> 31:25.967
Okay.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.094
Okay.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.559
Let's use Neal and J.D. for surveillance.

31:35.059 --> 31:35.977
I'll notify.

31:36.811 --> 31:39.981
We, uh, formed a pretty potent
interrogation duo there,

31:40.064 --> 31:40.940
didn't we, Captain?

31:42.525 --> 31:43.776
Fit him with a wire, Howard.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.990
I want my car, and I want it now!

31:49.073 --> 31:51.576
-All right, I'm on it, lady.
-It shouldn't be allowed.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.203
That lady should be required
to have a license.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.164
Her assertiveness marathon

31:56.247 --> 31:58.458
was nothing more
than an exercise in sadism.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.710
I was never so humiliated in my life.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.253
And those people,

32:02.545 --> 32:03.922
no wonder they want
assertiveness training.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.424
They just sat there and took it.
Can you believe it?

32:07.675 --> 32:08.509
Ah!

32:09.802 --> 32:11.638
-My keys aren't there.
-I know.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.307
Don't tell me something
happened to my car.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.267
Just calm down, lady.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.810
I'm gonna be right back.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.315
-(machinery whirring)
-(indistinct chattering)

32:23.441 --> 32:25.735
Hey, what did I tell you?

32:27.111 --> 32:29.572
The most important rule
is to never come up to this floor.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.324
Lady came in for her Porsche.

32:31.407 --> 32:34.160
So why didn't you use the intercom?
I would have brought the car down to you.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.995
That way, you wouldn't have seen a thing.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.915
Look, you guys want to drop a good engine,

32:38.998 --> 32:40.833
put in a clunker,
ain't no skin off my nose.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.544
-I don't care how you make a buck.
-I got enough partners.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.508
Hold it! Police officer,
you're under arrest.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.343
Drop it! Get down!

32:50.426 --> 32:51.678
You too, down!

32:51.761 --> 32:53.388
(engine turns over, tires squeal)

32:55.014 --> 32:58.434
This is Belker.
I got a code 37, red Porsche,

32:58.518 --> 33:03.064
Sullivan and Dekker
license number A-N-Q-251.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.358
Driver possibly armed. Get up.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.699
I didn't see that, right?
That was not my car.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.742
It belonged to someone else,
the car that went out of here.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.035
Lady, please.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.453
You don't have a gun in your hand.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.039
-This is not happening to me.
-I'm a police officer.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.500
Which means my car really was stolen.

33:22.583 --> 33:25.586
I got the license-plate number.
I put it out on the radio.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.172
I guarantee you
the man will be apprehended.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.216
It better not come back dented!

33:35.346 --> 33:37.807
FALCO: Maybe I should
chop off his ear this time.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.600
He don't hear too good anyway.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.936
I'll go in in my cover.
They're both packing.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.730
It'll make it easier
to get the drop on them.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.399
MCGUIRE: This guy's not only stupid,
but ugly, too.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.696
When do I go in, sir?

33:53.823 --> 33:55.825
When I yell, "You're under arrest."

33:57.744 --> 33:59.037
FALCO: He told you he had the money?

33:59.412 --> 34:01.664
-MCGUIRE: He said he already had it.
-(knock on door)

34:05.084 --> 34:07.545
Mr. Falco. Mr. McGuire.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.297
You don't learn, do you?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.257
I'm late. I know. I'm sorry.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.551
I think this is what you're waiting for.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.223
-How's the finger, Mr. Manes?
-What, this here?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.267
It's about to be a whole lot better.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.103
What the hell is going on here?
This is paper.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.189
Oh, jeez, well, you must be popped then.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.607
You must be under arrest!

34:27.690 --> 34:29.108
Eat the floor! Eat it!

34:29.192 --> 34:30.359
Oh, you're a cop?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.361
Yeah, you got that right, pal.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.155
How's that meat cleaver, Teddy, huh?

34:34.238 --> 34:36.407
You serve up any chipped beef today?

34:36.491 --> 34:38.117
Listen, do me a favor, would you?

34:38.201 --> 34:40.203
You do the honors on Mr. Falco there.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.162
I lay hands on him,

34:41.245 --> 34:44.082
I might like to snap his neck
like a Thanksgiving gobbler.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.334
Hey, listen,
I'll tell you the truth, Officer,

34:46.417 --> 34:47.960
and if Teddy's honest, he'll verify it.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.171
The other day, what he did to your finger,
it made me sick.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.508
-I mean, it made me sick to my stomach.
-Yeah, yeah, you're a real saint, McGuire.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.093
You hear what I'm saying, Teddy?

34:55.176 --> 34:57.804
I'd turn that freakin' mug of yours
into lemon meringue,

34:57.887 --> 34:59.639
except I'd wind up in the jackpot.

34:59.972 --> 35:03.559
Now, I'm gonna have to just get my jollies
from watching you get a double sawbuck.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.978
Yeah, but someone
had to be about the violence though--

35:06.062 --> 35:07.355
-What are you doing, kid?
-My cuffs.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.481
Watch it!

35:10.817 --> 35:13.736
-MCGUIRE: Please don't shoot me! Hey!
-Shut up, McGuire! You okay, kid?

35:13.820 --> 35:14.654
I'm okay.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.989
Look at this. Look at this!

35:17.657 --> 35:20.076
This moron went and made me kill him.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.328
Now, I'm gonna get all jammed up
on account of this.

35:22.411 --> 35:26.040
-MCGUIRE: Don't snuff me out.
-McGuire, shut up! Shut up!

35:30.920 --> 35:33.798
What's the problem?
I'll tell you what the problem is.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.426
Furillo is coming down hard on anybody
who even walks by the files.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.888
-But guess who's taking the most heat?
-WAITRESS: There you go, two coffees.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.308
He had me in interrogation.

35:44.725 --> 35:46.269
You ever been in interrogation?

35:46.352 --> 35:49.105
You've been true to the firm,
haven't you, Melvin?

35:49.188 --> 35:52.692
Yeah, sure,
but I need to take a little vacation.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.318
I'm gonna need tickets.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.320
A whole new wardrobe for the sun.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.446
Calm down, Melvin.

35:57.738 --> 36:00.366
-We've all gotta stay collected.
-Easy for you to say.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.952
I need more money right now.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.538
We might be able to arrange another...

36:05.621 --> 36:07.373
-$200, say?
-A thousand.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.460
A little grandiose for a petty thief,
aren't we, Melvin?

36:11.544 --> 36:13.838
-I'll tell him everything.
-I don't think so.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.132
Five-hundred.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.802
-Six.
-Five. Take it or leave it.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.558
Councilman Wade
needs to be assured that this buys

36:25.641 --> 36:28.227
total silence regarding
Detective Washington.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.564
Police, Mr. Mars. You're busted, sucker.

36:31.647 --> 36:34.150
-Come on, let's go, chump.
-Did I do all right?

36:34.692 --> 36:35.818
Yeah, you did great.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.779
-What?
-What?

36:38.988 --> 36:40.656
-Don't take it out on me.
-What?

36:40.740 --> 36:42.825
Every time something happens like today,
you take it out on me.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.244
-Don't--
-Renko, just knock it off,

36:45.328 --> 36:46.579
-all right?
-No, you don't talk to me,

36:46.662 --> 36:47.788
I'm not gonna talk to you, okay?

36:47.872 --> 36:48.915
-Good.
-Okay.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.250
Why won't you talk to me?

36:52.793 --> 36:53.920
Why won't you talk to me?

36:54.003 --> 36:55.504
-I love it.
-What?

36:55.588 --> 36:59.592
I call that lewd public display
by both parties. (chuckles)

36:59.675 --> 37:02.345
-Is that whose car I think it is?
-I sure hope so.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.229
You take the passenger's side, Andy.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.650
If it's that salesman,
we're gonna put his loudmouth butt away.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.119
I can explain, Officer.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.872
You lose your sample case again,
Mr. Sanderson?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.625
Bobbing for apples again, Cherie?
I'm afraid we're gonna have

37:32.708 --> 37:34.252
-to take you in.
-She entrapped me.

37:34.543 --> 37:35.628
That's a joke.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.968
Look, how about we be a little
reasonable about this, Officer?

37:42.051 --> 37:44.053
Oh, we intend to be, Mr. Sanderson.

37:44.136 --> 37:47.348
Mr. Sanderson, would you step out
of the car, please, sir?

37:47.431 --> 37:48.432
You're under arrest.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.603
CHASTITY: Patrick.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.149
I just want to talk with you for a moment.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.701
I'm leaving. I wanted you to know.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.663
Obviously, I can't complete my work here.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.751
At least we provided the order
with a cut-rate lease.

38:16.335 --> 38:17.169
(chuckles softly)

38:19.255 --> 38:21.632
I know one of the other sisters
will carry on.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.970
I realize that what happened today
was a great shock to you.

38:26.345 --> 38:29.098
I misjudged the situation. I'm sorry.

38:30.766 --> 38:31.600
It's okay.

38:32.059 --> 38:33.602
Don't condemn me, Patrick.

38:35.938 --> 38:39.650
Regardless of the circumstances,
we're two people who made a connection,

38:40.484 --> 38:41.777
however briefly.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.531
And that's something to be cherished.

38:46.949 --> 38:47.950
(sighs deeply)

38:48.034 --> 38:50.536
so, uh, what are you gonna do?

38:50.619 --> 38:51.495
I don't know.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.499
I have a lot of thinking ahead of me...

38:57.710 --> 38:59.128
But I'll come up with something.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.380
Well, I wish you, uh, luck.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.885
I think you have a lot
of good qualities...

39:07.178 --> 39:09.055
Just maybe you shouldn't be a nun.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.181
(chuckles)

39:12.058 --> 39:12.892
Thank you.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.065
-Goodbye, Patrick.
-Goodbye.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.742
(door opens and closes)

39:30.076 --> 39:31.452
WOMAN 1:
Move on! Move on right through here.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.204
WOMAN 2: Hill Street, can I help you? Yes?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.293
I've seen the Porsche in impound.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.504
Not a scratch on it.

39:41.587 --> 39:44.256
We got the owner
five blocks from the garage.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.301
-They said you'd give me a release form.
-Ah.

39:51.555 --> 39:54.016
Detective Belker,
I have a confession to make.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.019
When I saw my car fly out of that garage,

39:57.103 --> 40:00.439
a wave of emotion passed over me,
the like of which I've not felt in years.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.566
-Adrenaline.
-Excitement.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.361
And when you came down the ramp with a gun

40:05.444 --> 40:08.948
and told me who you were,
every part of me tingled.

40:09.281 --> 40:12.034
The old me would have kept it inside,
but I know now.

40:12.618 --> 40:13.953
I have to take the chance.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.122
(growls)

40:17.039 --> 40:17.873
(gasps)

40:18.374 --> 40:19.208
My God!

40:20.334 --> 40:22.128
You're a level-four assertive.

40:22.211 --> 40:24.171
-(growls loudly)
-(barks)

40:31.846 --> 40:34.140
-Good work, Neal, J.D.
-Thanks, Captain.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.183
You won't make this stick.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.601
Oh, I think we will.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.521
We have a signed statement
from the khaki officer you bribed

40:40.604 --> 40:42.273
and from your assistant, Mr. Mars.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.443
My lawyers will be here soon.
I don't have to say a thing.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.444
But he will.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.449
You've been out to hang me
from the beginning, Captain.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.992
You hanged yourself, Councilman.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.204
Hey, liaison.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.456
Hey, you got a minute, Lucy?

40:58.539 --> 40:59.790
-Yeah.
-Catch you later.

40:59.874 --> 41:00.708
Bye.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.043
-So, what's up?
-You busy tonight?

41:03.961 --> 41:06.755
Oh, you mean Sister Chastity's
dance card is filled up?

41:06.839 --> 41:08.841
-That's very funny. (chuckles)
-Thank you.

41:08.924 --> 41:13.220
It just so happens the assignment is over,
and I'll be riding with you tomorrow.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.805
Well, fine.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.142
-Something happened?
-No, nothing happened.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.894
She just gotta do
some other work for a while.

41:19.977 --> 41:20.978
Oh, good.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.480
Is there gonna an answer here or what?

41:22.563 --> 41:24.273
I figure we get a bite to eat, right?

41:24.356 --> 41:27.401
-Then maybe go see a movie or something.
-Like a date?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.154
We'll just relax, go out,
have a good time.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.740
Yeah, like a date.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.116
What's the big deal?

41:36.035 --> 41:36.911
Sounds good.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.499
MAN: Right through here, gentlemen.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.168
Here's the file, Captain.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.753
POMEROY:
About three and a half years, Lieutenant.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.296
-Officer Martin?
-Captain.

41:47.379 --> 41:48.672
BUNTZ: You want to know
what this here proves?

41:48.756 --> 41:50.591
POMEROY:
Lieutenant, all I want is to get home

41:50.674 --> 41:51.884
while my supper still looks like food.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.886
-You were Lieutenant Buntz's backup?
-Yes, sir.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.930
BUNTZ: What it proves, Officer Pomeroy,

41:56.013 --> 41:58.307
is it don't matter how careful you are,

41:58.390 --> 42:01.101
how much you're trying to bring him in
in one freakin' piece,

42:01.185 --> 42:04.438
if it's not supposed to happen,
you are gonna whack the guy out.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.524
It was my foul-up, sir.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.734
I gave the perpetrator opportunity.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.444
The lieutenant didn't provoke it?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.863
No way, sir. The guy
didn't give the lieutenant any choice.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.114
BUNTZ: I'm telling you, Pomeroy.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.076
See? So you might as well do
what you wanted to do in the first place.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.494
If it's gonna happen anyway,

42:18.577 --> 42:21.330
you might as well
get some freakin' satisfaction out of it.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.831
POMEROY: Oh, for crying out loud.

42:22.915 --> 42:25.000
Look, would someone get this guy
under control?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.752
Enough, Lieutenant. Come on.

42:26.835 --> 42:28.796
Hey, all right. I thought he might be
a football, you know?

42:28.879 --> 42:30.297
You know, I'm gonna have a little trouble

42:30.381 --> 42:32.758
distinguishing between
pre and postmortem trauma.

42:32.841 --> 42:35.094
Hey, God gives us all crosses, Doc,
you know?

42:35.177 --> 42:36.011
Norm.

42:37.805 --> 42:38.764
Hey, Captain.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.476
(laughs) You see Mr. Bad News here, huh?

42:42.560 --> 42:44.270
-Yeah, I see him.
-(laughing continues)

42:45.604 --> 42:47.231
Captain, right hand to God,

42:47.565 --> 42:50.025
I did everything but lay out a red carpet
for this creep here.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.652
Your backup corroborates.

42:52.861 --> 42:54.613
Will SID waive written
till tomorrow morning?

42:54.697 --> 42:56.365
You've got it, Captain.
Just get him out of here.

42:56.448 --> 42:58.576
Officer Pomeroy, aces guy, huh?

42:58.659 --> 43:00.035
Why don't you go home, Norman?

43:01.996 --> 43:04.582
-Once more for good luck, huh?
-Norm! Go home, Norm.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.208
(chuckles) All right, all right.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.837
Sure you don't want me to ride
with you guys, huh?

43:09.920 --> 43:12.172
Take Teddy here over to stiff palace, huh?

43:12.256 --> 43:13.465
-Norm.
-(chuckles)

43:14.300 --> 43:15.134
Norm.

43:15.801 --> 43:17.136
All right. (sniffles)

43:30.691 --> 43:31.734
(sighs deeply)

43:31.817 --> 43:34.403
Henry Goldblume
stares at his pocket tape recorder.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.159
He's feeling like a dope.

43:41.702 --> 43:44.913
"Who am I trying to kid?" He asks himself.
"I don't know how to tell stories."

43:47.625 --> 43:48.459
Henry...

43:50.502 --> 43:52.796
stop being a self-conscious jerk.

43:59.345 --> 44:02.640
Detective Cohen
walks into the chief's office.

44:04.558 --> 44:08.062
"Cohen! Been reading your report.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.480
First-rate stuff."

44:11.607 --> 44:15.277
It was the chief's heartiest liar's voice.

44:17.488 --> 44:21.659
Cohen knew it meant
the task force he'd suggested

44:21.742 --> 44:22.993
wasn't gonna get funded.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.207
"Damn close call on this, Detective."

44:30.376 --> 44:32.628
The chief screwed his features

44:33.796 --> 44:37.216
into a pained, thoughtful expression.

44:38.717 --> 44:39.760
"Damn close...

44:42.096 --> 44:45.683
But I don't think we're gonna be able
to get you the money you asked for."

44:59.822 --> 45:00.948
He had to be a smart guy, right?

45:01.031 --> 45:03.867
He's gotta be a tough guy, huh?
The stupid punk.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.036
-Couldn't listen to me--
-(knocking on door)

45:06.578 --> 45:08.372
-SID: Norm!
-Go away.

45:08.914 --> 45:10.791
-He's gotta listen to--
-(knocking continues)

45:10.874 --> 45:12.876
SID: It's me, Sid. Come on, let me in.

45:22.803 --> 45:23.637
Hey...

45:29.768 --> 45:30.894
I brought you some soup.

45:37.901 --> 45:40.028
Heard about the unfortunate death
of Teddy Falco.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.488
He brought it on himself.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.615
Hey, I don't doubt that
for one skinny second.

45:43.699 --> 45:46.535
Yeah? Well, try telling them that
at my precinct.

45:46.618 --> 45:49.079
What, your captain thinks you looked
to get this guy whacked out?

45:49.163 --> 45:51.540
I mean, I practically begged
this little germ to come in with me.

45:51.623 --> 45:53.667
All right. So then he
brought it down on himself.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.169
-Am I right, Norm?
-What was I supposed to do, huh?

45:55.252 --> 45:57.004
How was I supposed to go in there
without a piece again,

45:57.087 --> 45:58.756
get the rest of my fingers chopped off?

45:58.839 --> 46:00.924
What did he expect you to do,
go in for a pop naked?

46:01.008 --> 46:02.134
Sid, shut up.

46:02.801 --> 46:04.219
You know where I'm going
in this department, huh?

46:04.303 --> 46:05.763
-You know where I'm headed?
-No, where?

46:05.846 --> 46:08.348
No place. Every time I put one foot
in front of the other,

46:08.432 --> 46:09.683
some hump gets eighty-sixed.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.269
And fair or not,
you begin to get a reputation.

46:12.352 --> 46:14.104
People begin to see a trend.

46:14.188 --> 46:17.649
Hey, to hell with reputation, to hell
with people, and to hell with trends.

46:17.733 --> 46:20.068
I'm talking about career advancement here.

46:20.152 --> 46:21.987
And to tell with career advancements, too.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.656
And will you shut up
and stay put and don't move?

46:35.501 --> 46:36.502
(sighs)

46:38.003 --> 46:39.004
I'm going to bed.

46:45.427 --> 46:46.845
(groaning painfully)

46:49.014 --> 46:51.517
-What, you don't want any soup?
-No.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.939
Can I say one thing about your finger
before I leave?

46:57.022 --> 46:58.857
-No.
-A wound like that,

46:58.941 --> 47:02.486
you raise the afflicted area
above the region of the heart,

47:03.278 --> 47:04.696
the pain is lowered.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.620
Do that for a while,
maybe you'll get a little rest.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.623
What, I gotta do this all night?

47:14.873 --> 47:17.584
What are you talking about? You plump it
up with a pillow, elevate it.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.128
-You want me to do it for you?
-No, that's all right, I got it.

47:21.129 --> 47:23.090
Right. Good night, Norm.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.678
(door opens and closes)

47:29.596 --> 47:30.472
Thanks.

47:32.558 --> 47:33.559
SID: No problem.

47:34.226 --> 47:36.311
I was sorry I mangled it to begin with.

47:43.068 --> 47:46.071
(closing theme playing)
