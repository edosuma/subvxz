00:19.880 --> 00:21.810
Hang up.

00:21.810 --> 00:23.810
You're going to miss your flight.

00:23.810 --> 00:26.520
<i>Will you be okay without me there? </i>

00:27.610 --> 00:29.390
Don't worry about me.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.930
<i>I'll be back in 2 days... </i>

00:33.590 --> 00:34.900
Okay.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.360
A skeleton found in the reeds of Hwa Sung...

01:12.640 --> 01:14.770
The big guys upstairs must be in trauma.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.730
It sure is deserted.

01:18.730 --> 01:22.650
The weather is so nice.
How can there not be anyone walking by?

01:22.850 --> 01:24.530
If it was me,
I would abandon the body here too.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.620
As soon as it got reported to 112...

01:28.620 --> 01:30.810
The case went straight to the Chief.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.530
Hwa Sung serial murder...
repeated murder...

01:35.420 --> 01:38.370
This is the kind of case journalists like the most.

01:39.420 --> 01:40.960
I'm asking you this favor.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.650
Right now, being quick is important.

01:46.450 --> 01:47.800
They didn't bury it deep.

01:48.650 --> 01:52.260
The way they disposed of the body is so unprofessional.

01:52.830 --> 01:54.540
They were careless.

01:54.950 --> 01:59.010
Swamps usually have puddles that appear and disappear repeatedly.

02:00.050 --> 02:05.020
The criminal threw the bag into the puddle but it disappeared later.

02:07.880 --> 02:13.720
If the skeleton was left out for more than 6 months...

02:13.720 --> 02:16.360
It's going to be difficult to find the victim's identity.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.250
But lucky for us...

02:22.860 --> 02:24.750
There's a lot of clues left in the skeleton.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.060
If someone left the body in this kind of secluded area...

02:30.060 --> 02:32.440
I guess they wanted to hide the victim's identity.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.040
Do you think this was the work of an acquaintance?

02:36.840 --> 02:38.300
There's a good chance.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.620
Someone watching from nearby.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.790
In any case, we need to find the identity right away.

02:56.060 --> 03:02.070
[Woo Eum Murder Case]

03:08.150 --> 03:12.630
The older the body gets, the bone surface get smoother.

03:12.630 --> 03:14.340
But this body still has a rough texture.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.580
Early 20s to late 40s, female.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.660
Seeing that the pelvis is closed...

03:20.270 --> 03:22.220
She never experienced pregnancy.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.220
And you-

03:27.420 --> 03:29.680
As for the wound Director Yeo was asking about...

03:31.030 --> 03:33.910
Compared to other areas,
this area was cut cleanly.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.130
Handwoven.

03:36.130 --> 03:37.180
Why is that?

03:38.450 --> 03:41.200
Cosmetic surgery.
A cheekbone reduction.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.980
Ah! Wait! So...

03:43.980 --> 03:46.880
Then, I guess we'll have to check with all the cosmetic surgeons!

03:47.400 --> 03:50.320
Because this facial surgery requires professional medical attention...

03:50.320 --> 03:52.010
It was probably done in Seoul.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.010
That's a good thing, right?

03:55.780 --> 03:57.200
Detective Park, what are you doing?

03:57.900 --> 03:58.890
You should get going.

04:05.890 --> 04:06.860
What else?

04:06.860 --> 04:09.990
It seems like the direct cause of death was from a head injury.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.700
With this powerful of a hit...

04:12.700 --> 04:14.250
The victim would have died instantly.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.660
He even took out all her teeth.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.720
Clean murder... perfect cleanup.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.960
This area was burned down by pesticides this past January.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.520
Really?

04:36.710 --> 04:40.450
Then, that means he threw the bag away after.

04:41.910 --> 04:45.520
So, that means the puddle appeared after January?

04:46.270 --> 04:50.170
Pull up all missing person reports from January to March.

04:52.000 --> 04:52.810
Thank you.

04:52.810 --> 04:56.900
Cheek reduction surgeries are typically split into 2 types.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.220
This one is a non-fixated surgery.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.120
After cutting it with a machine,
they pushed it in and then attached.

05:02.590 --> 05:05.560
At the most, 30% receive non-fixated surgery.

05:06.250 --> 05:11.010
I'd say about 100 hospitals have the equipment to perform this surgery.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.190
100 hospitals?

05:15.090 --> 05:16.700
Any other tips?

05:16.700 --> 05:21.040
This surgeon must have been very skilled to perform this kind of surgery.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.670
I'm guessing he was an expert in Dentistry.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.540
You can't give me the roster?

05:26.540 --> 05:28.500
I'm telling you that someone died!

05:29.030 --> 05:32.560
We value the privacy of our clients.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.610
I thought you would know.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.270
If you're frustrated,
come back with a warrant.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.160
Fine.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.970
It's just a roster!

05:49.090 --> 05:51.450
Hello? Detective Baek?

05:51.450 --> 05:53.290
I think I need your help.

05:56.020 --> 06:01.940
This is a limited edition item imported directly from New York.

06:03.290 --> 06:04.660
I guess it was expensive?

06:05.310 --> 06:06.280
Very.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.450
Yeo Kyung!

06:15.450 --> 06:18.630
Please search for anyone that left for America in 2011.

06:18.630 --> 06:21.330
Give me a separate report on those immigrants with higher incomes.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.150
Isn't this disrupting our business?

06:37.080 --> 06:38.560
But, we're all customers.

06:39.970 --> 06:41.400
Hey kids!

06:42.290 --> 06:44.480
Why are you here?

06:44.480 --> 06:45.820
To get prettier.

06:48.030 --> 06:49.490
It says right there.

06:49.490 --> 06:50.890
Free consultation.

07:06.370 --> 07:07.280
Yeah?

07:07.280 --> 07:10.410
This might sound a bit funny to you right now but...

07:10.410 --> 07:13.590
We're lucky we found the skeleton when we did.

07:13.590 --> 07:15.600
Any later and there wouldn't be any bone fragments left.

07:16.190 --> 07:17.470
What are you saying?

07:17.470 --> 07:18.910
It was chemically processed.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.890
- Chemical?
- Isn't it tempting?

07:21.890 --> 07:26.090
It would take some time to find the exact chemical mixtures.

07:26.090 --> 07:28.050
But, there is a large dose of hydrofluoric acid.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.200
If it's hydrofluoric acid...

07:31.200 --> 07:34.660
If there was an accidental gas leak,
it would've been in the papers.

07:34.660 --> 07:38.000
After all, plants die just by being exposed to the air.

07:39.190 --> 07:42.070
The body was soaked in hydrofluoric acid.

07:42.070 --> 07:47.580
It penetrates through the skin tissue and then corrodes the bones.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.650
Then, the criminal is someone who knows something about chemistry.

07:59.630 --> 08:01.190
Okay. Thank you.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.290
Lee So Jung?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.490
We're back!

08:12.490 --> 08:14.290
You're back?

08:21.390 --> 08:22.600
What are you doing?

08:25.270 --> 08:29.320
I believe we'll have the victim's identity within 16 hours.

08:31.610 --> 08:32.789
Good work everyone.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.810
This coffee tastes great!

08:50.320 --> 08:52.430
Now, allow me to begin.

08:53.550 --> 08:57.950
Feb 16 - the day after she went missing, the start of the investigation...

08:57.950 --> 09:00.710
But due to lack of evidence,
the investigation was aborted.

09:00.710 --> 09:04.000
Travel freelance writer,
Lee So Jung, age 34.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.790
Missing period, cosmetic surgery,
correct age group, correct gender.

09:07.790 --> 09:10.280
Since we even confirmed her travel records...

09:11.080 --> 09:13.740
All that's left to check is the DNA.

09:13.740 --> 09:16.970
It was bizarre already to find a skeleton after 3 months.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.170
But, now it's chemically treated...

09:20.330 --> 09:22.940
If her husband was a chemistry professor...

09:23.470 --> 09:25.460
This, this-

09:25.460 --> 09:30.140
This is the fastest case we've ever solved in Ten history.

09:30.730 --> 09:31.920
Oh, it's sweet.

09:41.710 --> 09:42.640
Should I go catch him?

09:44.920 --> 09:46.710
No need to rush.

09:46.710 --> 09:47.870
Why?

09:47.870 --> 09:52.730
Wouldn't it be easier to catch him when he least expects it?

09:54.430 --> 09:55.270
Of course.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.470
You have a visitor.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.930
After seeing the articles,
I came for confirmation.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.510
The bag looked familiar...

10:32.170 --> 10:33.340
But I thought no way...

10:38.430 --> 10:40.320
These belonged to my wife.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.630
There's a chance it's not her.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.640
Please verify accordingly.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.900
- Check this for me.
- Yes.

11:01.550 --> 11:03.560
I'll be asking you some basic questions.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.240
Ask away.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.440
The day she disappeared...
Where were you on Feb 15, Friday?

11:11.010 --> 11:12.960
I was at a seminar in Jeju Island.

11:14.360 --> 11:18.750
After the lecture, she packed my things and visited the school.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.090
What time is your flight?

11:21.090 --> 11:22.160
9:30.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.770
You only have 3 hours left.

11:33.730 --> 11:35.330
Let's hug before I leave.

11:36.460 --> 11:37.970
It's fine.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.430
Have a nice trip.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.810
But still-

11:40.810 --> 11:42.270
We'll be apart for 3 days.

11:44.260 --> 11:46.840
You're going to be late.
Have fun.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.420
I thought something was weird then...

11:50.420 --> 11:52.620
But I thought she was just in a bad mood.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.250
Then, I guess that was the last time you saw her.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.920
Did you not contact her?

11:59.420 --> 12:03.120
Before the flight, we talked on the phone.

12:04.610 --> 12:06.430
But after that, she stopped picking up.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.660
You reported her missing the next day, Saturday.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.640
It was very sudden.

12:17.500 --> 12:22.490
I was busy with the seminar so I asked my mother in law.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.420
It was a Saturday morning.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.000
She said no one was home.

12:29.790 --> 12:33.570
Her things were still there,
only she disappeared.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.130
Even leaving her phone...

12:35.130 --> 12:37.690
But the body was discovered 3 months later...

12:41.000 --> 12:42.900
Is there anyone suspicious?

12:45.880 --> 12:48.580
After my wife disappeared,
I thought about everything.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.030
But the thing that drives my crazy...

12:52.440 --> 12:54.460
No matter how hard I think...

12:55.360 --> 13:00.210
There's no one who would want to kill her.

13:09.650 --> 13:10.920
What do you think?

13:12.570 --> 13:15.400
If that man really is the criminal...

13:15.400 --> 13:17.290
He must be having a hard time.

13:21.230 --> 13:24.640
4 suspects

13:31.940 --> 13:35.190
No reason to run away,
no reason to be kidnapped...

13:35.920 --> 13:38.070
The husband came here almost every night.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.520
I had such a hard time with this one.

13:41.030 --> 13:44.970
Was there anything suspicious about the wife?

13:44.970 --> 13:49.380
There was one classmate that she called often.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.710
But we couldn't reach him so we stopped calling.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.750
How's the husband?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.880
His alibi is an alibi but...

14:00.880 --> 14:03.340
There's not enough evidence for him to be suspicious.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.420
Anyway, everything should be in those files.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.310
- Did you find anything?
- Not yet.

14:30.590 --> 14:31.950
Did you find anything?

14:31.950 --> 14:33.070
Min Ho!

14:34.310 --> 14:37.670
We looked in the bathroom.
There's no blood samples anywhere.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.940
Really?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.630
That's strange...

14:47.760 --> 14:50.110
They don't have a maid.

14:51.210 --> 14:52.840
But it's still clean.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.640
He went cross country.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.920
There's nowhere he didn't go.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.510
Looking at his navigation system...

15:16.510 --> 15:18.970
He went everywhere where other bodies were found.

15:18.970 --> 15:21.610
Even his wife's friends...

15:23.610 --> 15:25.810
Looks like he went everywhere.

15:25.810 --> 15:26.940
How unfortunate.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.260
That's that.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.330
If the bag was taken from this house...

15:33.330 --> 15:35.890
They should've disposed the body here.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.400
How can there be no traces of blood?

15:40.950 --> 15:45.810
Just like the body, did they chemically clean the house too?

15:46.480 --> 15:47.810
Then?

15:48.190 --> 15:50.630
If he had this house chemically treated...

15:51.310 --> 15:53.830
Either he stayed here for a long period of time...

15:53.830 --> 15:56.830
Or he came back to do the deed.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.130
On top of that...

15:59.130 --> 16:02.030
Seeing that there are no signs of a break in...

16:02.900 --> 16:07.650
That means they're comfortable getting in and out of the house.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.730
It's good to see you but talking about murder is a bit much!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.470
I'm not a professor anymore,
I'm a Detective.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.510
Professor Shin Young Geun...

16:21.250 --> 16:25.220
...is a remarkable person for someone his age.

16:25.220 --> 16:28.530
His thesis was even chosen to be the cover letter for "Nature".

16:29.330 --> 16:31.290
He has skills... he has manners.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.790
He's from a prestigious background.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.370
I heard that...

16:37.370 --> 16:40.910
He even pays tuition for low income students.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.910
Let's stop with the good things.

16:44.910 --> 16:47.310
I want to hear the bad things.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.470
Bad things?

16:51.050 --> 16:52.370
I'm not sure.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.020
Ah! I have one.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.180
His exam questions are too hard.

17:00.190 --> 17:04.490
All the students call him by his nickname,
"Difficult Shin Young Geun."

17:05.599 --> 17:07.160
He has no flaws.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.710
What about his relationship with his wife?

17:12.130 --> 17:13.770
It's sad.

17:14.670 --> 17:17.829
7 years ago, there was an accident at this school.

17:18.170 --> 17:23.020
So Jung locked the laboratory doors without thinking.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.359
But there was a fire inside.

17:25.359 --> 17:29.100
The firefighters obviously put it out with water.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.690
Not knowing that there was sodium monoxide inside.

17:41.190 --> 17:44.970
You can't spray water here!
There's sodium monoxide!

17:44.970 --> 17:46.970
Stop the water!

17:47.360 --> 17:51.640
There were no laboratory safety manuals at the time.

17:52.650 --> 17:56.490
So Jung's fiancée ended up dying in that fire.

17:57.270 --> 18:00.840
The one who comforted her during those times was Professor Shin.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.400
Someone definitely committed that crime.

18:09.150 --> 18:13.590
At 9:16 AM, she called her mother...

18:13.590 --> 18:17.570
"I might return the muffler."

18:17.570 --> 18:22.230
11:20 AM, she sent her husband off to work.

18:22.380 --> 18:23.850
Drive safely!

18:24.680 --> 18:26.280
5:00 PM...

18:26.810 --> 18:29.900
Dropped off lunch...

18:34.020 --> 18:37.970
6:00 PM, dropped off her husband's bag...

18:41.360 --> 18:43.090
Let's hug before I leave.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.130
9:03 PM...

18:45.790 --> 18:49.500
Talked on the phone with her husband who was at the airport...

18:50.300 --> 18:52.840
Hang up. You're going to miss your flight.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.450
Will you be okay without me there?

18:56.610 --> 18:58.820
Don't worry about me.

18:58.820 --> 19:01.380
Final moments before she disappeared...

19:02.080 --> 19:03.490
9:03...

19:06.250 --> 19:08.940
Final moments before she disappeared...

19:11.560 --> 19:13.410
9:03

19:16.840 --> 19:18.080
This...

19:18.520 --> 19:22.330
If I split this perfectly,
it means we'll get together.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.920
You're here for Professor Shin?

19:37.920 --> 19:38.800
Yes?

19:39.610 --> 19:42.540
There's a female student who comes here often.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.880
Female student?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.430
She's pretty, polite.

19:47.430 --> 19:49.790
Did she say she was a teacher's assistant?

19:50.590 --> 19:54.560
She goes to that house often even without the owner there.

19:55.340 --> 19:57.310
She was there the day before yesterday.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.180
- Yeo Kyung?
- Yes?

20:07.180 --> 20:09.440
There's a classmate of Lee So Jung named Na Won Hak.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.500
We can't contact him so look into his records.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.360
- Yes.
- Ah! And...

20:15.300 --> 20:17.140
Was there anything on the security cameras?

20:17.140 --> 20:19.500
These are from Woo Eun Do.

20:35.790 --> 20:37.960
Korea Graduate School,
Department of Chemistry?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.980
This is where Shin Young Geun is.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.490
Kim Min Jung.

20:49.310 --> 20:50.910
Age: 27.

20:52.690 --> 20:54.530
1:26

21:01.970 --> 21:04.450
Time of entry 1:26

21:07.620 --> 21:09.620
Time she left, 2:08...

21:22.640 --> 21:23.600
Female?

21:26.040 --> 21:29.310
Female

21:43.050 --> 21:46.500
Hobbies... class schedule...

21:47.010 --> 21:49.930
All the memos are only about Professor Shin.

21:51.860 --> 21:53.720
But...

21:53.720 --> 21:56.370
Where do you think she went with her phone turned off?

21:57.060 --> 21:59.500
As soon as the accident reports came out yesterday...

22:00.230 --> 22:01.940
She searched all of them.

22:04.220 --> 22:05.410
And then she went into hiding.

22:07.940 --> 22:11.300
She said she wasn't feeling well and wanted to rest for a few days.

22:20.570 --> 22:23.220
Someone who's resting for a few days doesn't turn off her laptop.

22:24.780 --> 22:26.260
Did something bad happen?

22:29.530 --> 22:33.510
Kim Min Jung went over to the Professor's house often.

22:33.510 --> 22:35.810
This is kind of uncomfortable but...

22:35.810 --> 22:37.990
Did those two have something going on?

22:38.990 --> 22:39.990
No.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.770
More like...
Kim Min Jung liked him by herself.

22:43.770 --> 22:45.920
- By herself?
- Yes.

22:47.170 --> 22:51.790
She was pretty famous for that by the faculty.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.630
To look good in front of the teachers...

22:54.630 --> 22:57.020
She did anything to get her grades up.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.610
But Professor Shin didn't buy that.

23:05.470 --> 23:07.390
But since she did have the skills...

23:07.390 --> 23:09.800
Professor Shin turned a blind eye.

23:10.610 --> 23:12.840
In the end, she was recognized.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.640
Was recognized?

23:16.460 --> 23:17.840
Is she not now?

23:17.840 --> 23:19.650
Since you're speaking in past tense.

23:20.830 --> 23:21.870
I just-

23:23.120 --> 23:26.900
Once Bae Seon Yeon came in,
Kim Min Jung threw a fit.

23:26.900 --> 23:30.490
After all, there was a huge difference in their grades.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.150
Bae Seo Yeon?

23:36.140 --> 23:38.270
Are you here to talk about her case?

23:39.780 --> 23:41.890
Why do you think we're here for that?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.320
If I were a Detective...

23:45.320 --> 23:47.310
I would look for Kim Min Jung too.

23:53.330 --> 23:55.920
She was in charge of the protective equipment.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.950
But, only my glove was torn.

24:00.950 --> 24:02.840
That's the kind of girl she is.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.350
She'll do whatever it takes to get what she wants.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.560
You know, right?

24:08.560 --> 24:11.000
That Kim Min Jung was obsessed with Professor Shin.

24:19.860 --> 24:20.800
Yes?

24:22.430 --> 24:23.520
Got it.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.380
They discovered Kim Min Jung's car.

24:32.850 --> 24:33.750
Thanks.

24:43.450 --> 24:44.430
What happened?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.450
Charcoal tracks.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.280
Come here!

25:15.810 --> 25:18.230
It's the same type of bag the body was found in.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.790
This looks like a will.

25:31.770 --> 25:32.940
It is a will.

25:34.050 --> 25:36.120
She's saying she regrets killing Lee So Jung.

25:37.490 --> 25:40.200
She even wrote out how she killed the victim.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.020
2 days after we start the investigation...

25:44.580 --> 25:46.160
The suspect commits suicide.

25:48.010 --> 25:51.660
Wait, then... Are we done with this case?

25:52.120 --> 25:55.740
But something doesn't feel right.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.330
That's right.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.810
Someone who was searching up the case commits suicide.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.760
Writes a long will...

26:06.880 --> 26:08.180
Typed out.

26:12.140 --> 26:14.980
She died from carbon monoxide released from charcoal.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.280
Brain dead from low levels of oxygen.

26:17.640 --> 26:21.340
Time of death,
around 9-12 PM last night.

26:21.820 --> 26:22.930
Anything else?

26:22.930 --> 26:25.270
There are large amounts of amine detected in her stomach.

26:26.170 --> 26:27.520
Amine?

26:27.520 --> 26:29.010
Sleeping pills?

26:29.010 --> 26:31.770
It's the same formula as the pills found inside the vehicle.

26:31.770 --> 26:33.400
But the strange thing is...

26:33.400 --> 26:36.340
You can't get these pills without a prescription.

26:36.340 --> 26:39.140
But, Kim Min Jung has no records of getting a prescription.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.880
There's no way she stole someone else's pills before she died.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.000
Then, that means someone got the prescription to kill.

26:53.030 --> 26:56.700
Looking at her GPS records and her phone call history...

26:56.700 --> 26:59.680
It shows that she went straight to the suicide scene from her house.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.280
So, whoever prepared the will...

27:03.280 --> 27:06.060
Did they leave together?

27:07.390 --> 27:09.620
No suspicious numbers?

27:09.620 --> 27:11.100
None.

27:18.310 --> 27:20.810
Detective Baek! Come over here.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.620
The print records show that...

27:26.620 --> 27:29.400
...the last time she printed something was 3 days ago.

27:31.230 --> 27:34.160
The will wasn't printed here.

27:35.490 --> 27:38.230
But there's no reason for her to print her own will at a computer lab.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.040
This will...

27:44.900 --> 27:46.330
We have a problem.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.930
According to Kim Min Jung's blog...

27:52.930 --> 27:56.360
She used things like adjectives and adverbs often.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.520
If she had written a will moments before her death...

28:00.520 --> 28:04.000
Her descriptions and emotions in her writing would be strong.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.540
However...

28:05.540 --> 28:07.720
This will does the opposite.

28:08.350 --> 28:11.760
"Professor, please forgive me.
Goodbye everyone."

28:12.360 --> 28:15.260
This last sentence is stiff and businesslike.

28:15.260 --> 28:19.130
Not sociable, more like she's suppressing her emotions.

28:19.600 --> 28:23.820
This will utilizes a very unique grammar style.

28:23.820 --> 28:26.880
"Which I used to kill his wife..."

28:27.240 --> 28:33.750
It's utilizing the English way of saying passive expressions.

28:34.090 --> 28:39.160
Using tense pre-final endings and repeating conjugations.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.670
Kim Min Jung's features are not included in this will.

28:43.670 --> 28:47.350
It's hard to say that Kim Min Jung is the owner of this will.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.660
One more thing.

28:50.570 --> 28:54.600
"From the remote tree area,
5 minutes after you make a right..."

28:54.600 --> 28:58.310
This person didn't use direction,
they used time.

28:58.310 --> 29:01.020
"I pushed a heavy bag."

29:01.020 --> 29:04.130
Not a simple. "I hid the bag."

29:04.130 --> 29:05.640
"Heavy", "pushed"

29:05.640 --> 29:11.120
Whoever wrote this must be a very responsible, organized person.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.270
Whoever wrote this will pretending to be Kim Min Jung...

29:15.270 --> 29:18.350
...is most likely the real murderer of Lee So Jung.

29:19.310 --> 29:22.230
Then... what does that make Kim Min Jung?

29:22.230 --> 29:23.670
One of two things.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.700
Dying after being framed.

29:29.390 --> 29:30.970
Or dying as an accomplice.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.320
Accomplice?

29:40.230 --> 29:41.350
February 15.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.510
Hey, Min Ho.

29:44.370 --> 29:46.350
If it's February 15...

29:46.350 --> 29:48.350
Isn't that the day Lee So Jung went missing?

29:49.110 --> 29:51.120
Yes, that's right.
Why?

29:52.330 --> 29:53.670
Come here.

29:58.680 --> 29:59.900
February 15.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.220
February 15.

30:06.270 --> 30:07.440
9:00.

30:09.060 --> 30:10.220
1 AM.

30:13.340 --> 30:15.920
If it's 9 PM to 1 AM?

30:16.880 --> 30:20.650
Isn't this the time Lee So Jung was murdered?

30:21.310 --> 30:22.190
Yes.

30:23.570 --> 30:26.590
These are all decorated alibis.

30:28.010 --> 30:29.190
Not decorated...

30:30.880 --> 30:32.360
She's showing evidence.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.270
Discretely.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.570
Evidence?

30:37.570 --> 30:40.990
She forged Polaroid photos.

30:40.990 --> 30:44.620
And purposefully chose places unrelated to the murder operation.

30:44.620 --> 30:48.450
For a more accurate time...

30:49.380 --> 30:51.110
She even put receipts.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.890
On top of that. there's names underneath every photo.

30:55.690 --> 30:56.710
Then...

30:57.410 --> 30:59.860
The driver caught on the security camera that night...

30:59.860 --> 31:02.930
...wasn't Kim Min Jung but someone else!

31:03.500 --> 31:04.850
Right.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.160
But what I want to know is...

31:09.110 --> 31:11.790
Why would a smart woman prepare something like this?

31:13.580 --> 31:14.660
Why would she?

31:15.500 --> 31:16.930
That night...

31:18.040 --> 31:24.040
She knew something dangerous would happen to her.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.750
Then...

31:27.860 --> 31:31.340
Then there was someone else driving Kim Min Jung's car that night.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.600
And Kim Min Jung already knew about that person.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.170
She was an accomplice!

31:41.750 --> 31:43.670
Kim Min Jung and this driver...

31:43.920 --> 31:45.670
The real murderer of Lee So Jung...

31:46.650 --> 31:47.660
...are all females.

31:48.790 --> 31:52.310
But, why didn't they move together?

31:52.960 --> 31:54.610
They probably divided the roles.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.950
One kills, the other cleans it up.

31:58.770 --> 32:01.810
But those two don't seem like they get along that great.

32:03.830 --> 32:07.120
While Kim Min Jung was trying to save herself...

32:07.120 --> 32:10.490
The other was planning on how to get rid of Kim Min Jung.

32:11.350 --> 32:13.370
Why would accomplices do that to each other?

32:14.360 --> 32:19.380
But 12 hours into the investigation the accomplice was removed.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.450
Why did they take their time?

32:22.450 --> 32:24.770
They probably knew we were closing up the case.

32:26.810 --> 32:27.990
Who could it be?

32:28.970 --> 32:30.590
The surviving accomplice.

34:12.460 --> 34:15.429
Accomplice

34:22.310 --> 34:23.880
Detective Baek.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.179
I found information on Lee So Jung's old classmate.

34:33.830 --> 34:35.650
Motel?

34:40.550 --> 34:41.580
What?

34:41.580 --> 34:42.820
Are you dating?

35:05.480 --> 35:07.790
The victim has a lot of data.

35:08.450 --> 35:10.500
Can I get you more coffee?

35:11.320 --> 35:12.280
Double.

35:15.530 --> 35:19.380
Director, the pills found in Kim Min Jung's car are from...

35:19.380 --> 35:23.480
...the school's pharmacy.
We checked the serial number.

35:23.930 --> 35:27.730
But, we found a funny name in the student prescription list.

35:27.730 --> 35:31.000
Bae Seo Yeon was known to be Kim Min Jung's school rival.

35:39.170 --> 35:40.680
I found her.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.270
The one who wrote the will.

35:43.270 --> 35:46.280
Sentence structure,
preferred vocab...

35:46.690 --> 35:49.180
Even the dry and restrained emotion...

35:49.180 --> 35:50.750
There's no mistake.

35:51.110 --> 35:52.430
Who is it?

35:52.430 --> 35:55.020
I found her from the Student Association.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.630
Teaching assistant,
Bae Seo Yeon?

36:00.870 --> 36:02.120
Bae Seo Yeon?

36:10.920 --> 36:12.940
She totally fooled me.

36:13.350 --> 36:14.870
Anyway...

36:14.870 --> 36:18.610
I should've known when she kept trying to blame Kim Min Jung.

36:19.480 --> 36:20.830
But it's strange.

36:21.750 --> 36:24.210
Those two never even locked eyes.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.210
How did they conspire together?

36:27.520 --> 36:29.290
Take a look at this.

36:29.290 --> 36:32.630
"Professor and graduate student,
the cartel of silence that exists."

36:32.630 --> 36:35.890
Bae Seo Yeon uploaded that online 6 months ago.

36:35.890 --> 36:40.420
She wrote an essay revealing that a professor stole her research.

36:42.210 --> 36:44.900
She won't stand for unjustness.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.940
She has her beliefs.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.850
Professor Shin was the one who accepted her even after that paper.

36:53.570 --> 36:54.340
Wait.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.210
Then...

36:56.590 --> 36:59.730
Like the way Kim Min Jung was obsessed with Professor Shin...

36:59.730 --> 37:03.220
Was Bae Seo Yeon also obsessed with the only person who believed her?

37:03.220 --> 37:04.900
That's why they conspired.

37:04.900 --> 37:08.430
That would make Lee So Jung the enemy on both sides.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.860
Wait... so...

37:10.860 --> 37:12.920
The reason why Kim Min Jung was killed...

37:12.920 --> 37:15.960
...was so Bae Seo Yeon could keep him to herself?

37:17.220 --> 37:18.170
Who knows.

37:19.460 --> 37:23.520
I'm curious about what's inside as well.

37:59.430 --> 38:00.750
Nam Won Hak?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.740
I'm here to talk about Lee So Jung.

39:08.330 --> 39:10.350
Save me! Save me!

39:10.800 --> 39:12.900
Stay right there!

39:13.710 --> 39:15.590
I'm with the police.

39:16.910 --> 39:18.080
You're the police?

39:18.960 --> 39:20.130
Yeah I am!

39:26.540 --> 39:30.830
You probably didn't get much sleep. Your face is bloated.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.730
I have some problems.

39:35.610 --> 39:37.700
Why don't you take some sleeping pills?

39:38.520 --> 39:42.330
I had some but I lost them not too long ago.

39:45.420 --> 39:48.680
What were you doing yesterday between 9 PM to 12?

39:49.480 --> 39:50.850
I was home.

39:52.030 --> 39:54.390
I had some assignments to do for the Professor.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.380
So, 3 months ago...

39:57.380 --> 40:00.610
On the day Lee So Jung disappeared...

40:01.880 --> 40:03.820
What did you do that night?

40:03.820 --> 40:06.700
It was too long ago.
I don't remember.

40:07.330 --> 40:08.280
Nope.

40:09.270 --> 40:10.280
You should know.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.810
I remember now!

40:25.810 --> 40:27.350
I was at Woo Eum Do.

40:28.550 --> 40:29.620
Why?

40:30.500 --> 40:32.290
Just for a drive.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.530
Did you load a dead body inside your trunk?

40:36.840 --> 40:38.700
What are you saying?

40:38.700 --> 40:40.970
You went to Woo Eum Do to abandon the dead body.

40:42.030 --> 40:45.210
5 minutes after you take a right from the remote tree area.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.470
To the puddles.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.650
Yeh Ri is coming off a bit strong.

41:01.150 --> 41:02.790
Why did you go to Woo Eum Do?

41:03.890 --> 41:05.810
I just told you.

41:06.770 --> 41:08.890
I was just out for a drive.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.060
Director.

41:25.430 --> 41:26.870
What's wrong with her?

41:39.350 --> 41:41.340
Yeh Ri, what's wrong?

41:42.210 --> 41:44.160
She was straight up lying.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.380
I'm not sure.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.210
About that girl...

41:59.280 --> 42:00.780
Everyone should see this.

42:06.310 --> 42:11.720
I just met up with Lee So Jung's old classmate.

42:12.110 --> 42:16.050
But that guy was begging me to save him.

42:16.050 --> 42:16.880
Why?

42:18.410 --> 42:22.660
He said whoever killed Lee So Jung is after him now.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.220
Bae Seo Yeon, Kim Min Jung?

42:25.780 --> 42:26.730
No.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.000
Shin Young Geun.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.620
Shin Young Geun?

42:35.470 --> 42:36.840
That guy...

42:39.240 --> 42:41.230
...told me an interesting story from the past.

42:44.700 --> 42:46.180
After seeing the fire...

42:46.180 --> 42:48.180
We all went to go see it.

43:07.950 --> 43:09.520
That bastard was smiling.

43:12.040 --> 43:14.010
I could've seen wrong.

43:14.010 --> 43:17.060
It might even be nothing.

43:17.060 --> 43:19.060
But I can't forget that moment.

43:23.900 --> 43:28.660
One day, I was drunk and I told So Jung about what I saw.

43:29.310 --> 43:33.600
The next day, she kept calling to ask me what I saw.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.230
And so...

43:35.230 --> 43:38.300
She got very shocked after that.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.390
Detective, please save me.

43:42.390 --> 43:44.540
I could end up like So Jung!

43:48.310 --> 43:50.320
So you hid for 3 months?

44:29.510 --> 44:31.320
So that means this case...

44:32.210 --> 44:34.990
He killed for the woman he loved.

44:36.020 --> 44:38.480
And to hide that murder...

44:38.480 --> 44:41.350
He killed her.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.280
Not love but desire.

44:45.670 --> 44:49.350
Trying to get the thing you want... filthy desire.

44:49.350 --> 44:52.230
Then, what about Bae Seo Yeon and Kim Min Jung?

44:52.230 --> 44:54.340
Shin Young Geun's accomplices.

44:54.340 --> 44:58.180
As soon as we catch Shin Young Geun, those girls are next.

44:59.070 --> 45:03.490
So are you saying that he ordered those girls to kill his wife?

45:04.370 --> 45:07.120
The relationship between those three are still unknown.

45:10.540 --> 45:15.150
Shin Young Geun was excluded because of his alibi.

45:16.590 --> 45:18.880
But he had 2 accomplices.

45:18.880 --> 45:19.880
And so...

45:22.030 --> 45:24.270
Faking your alibi is no problem.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.500
From the moment Shin Young Geun made up his alibi.

45:36.620 --> 45:41.570
We need to re-investigate this case over again.

45:41.570 --> 45:44.550
Let's start from the day the criminal committed the crime.

45:48.960 --> 45:52.130
Difficult

46:09.670 --> 46:10.720
La Beaute?

46:13.520 --> 46:15.480
- Hey.
- Yes?

46:15.480 --> 46:16.640
What's La Beaute?

46:18.370 --> 46:19.630
La Beaute?

46:19.630 --> 46:21.630
Is it an acronym?

46:25.090 --> 46:26.960
2:26

46:27.670 --> 46:29.760
3:37

46:30.750 --> 46:33.040
She should've been home during these times.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.740
She didn't pick up.

46:35.930 --> 46:38.080
Was she busy packing his lunch?

46:38.550 --> 46:39.940
La Beaute?

46:52.440 --> 46:54.380
<i>Don't worry about me. </i>

46:59.230 --> 47:00.620
<i>Drive safely! </i>

47:05.610 --> 47:07.010
<i>Let's hug before I leave. </i>

47:08.010 --> 47:10.110
If you take out Shin Young Geun's testimony...

47:10.110 --> 47:13.660
The last time she was alive...

47:13.660 --> 47:16.490
...was 5:00 when she came to meet her husband.

47:17.530 --> 47:19.950
Did she meet with her husband after?

47:24.430 --> 47:26.660
She was one of our VIP customers.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.020
If she can't make it,
she usually calls us beforehand.

47:30.020 --> 47:32.200
But that day, she didn't call to cancel and never showed up.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.370
She had an 11:00 appointment?

47:34.370 --> 47:37.610
She usually came in during free hours.

47:38.630 --> 47:41.080
2 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon.

47:41.080 --> 47:44.280
We called her 4 times but it seems like she never picked up.

47:49.550 --> 47:51.600
But why do you think she didn't pick up?

47:58.970 --> 48:02.080
The day his wife disappeared,
She came...

48:02.080 --> 48:04.100
...around 5 PM to drop off his lunch?

48:04.100 --> 48:06.060
Yes, I remember.

48:06.060 --> 48:08.670
The police already asked about that several times.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.240
Did you see her go home by any chance?

48:15.520 --> 48:16.830
I don't know.

48:16.830 --> 48:18.830
I wasn't able to see her in person.

48:20.750 --> 48:22.210
Is there anyone that saw her?

48:26.580 --> 48:27.690
Ah Yeon Hee!

48:28.760 --> 48:31.570
You ate with us that day, right?

48:31.570 --> 48:34.860
The day Professor Shin's wife disappeared.

48:34.860 --> 48:36.590
Ah! But why?

48:37.270 --> 48:39.120
Did you see her in person?

48:39.120 --> 48:41.660
No, I didn't see her.

48:48.270 --> 48:51.020
So how did you know it was her that brought the lunch?

48:51.910 --> 48:56.130
Someone told us so we all just assumed.

48:56.130 --> 48:57.250
Who?

49:01.230 --> 49:02.250
Min Jung.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.250
Kim Min Jung?

49:05.490 --> 49:06.420
Yes.

49:12.420 --> 49:13.430
Thanks.

49:16.940 --> 49:19.800
This was the last time Lee So Jung was alive.

49:21.100 --> 49:23.150
In Shin Young Geun's testimony...

49:23.150 --> 49:25.700
The last time she was alive was at the staff room.

49:25.700 --> 49:29.570
But nobody saw her in real life.

49:29.570 --> 49:33.110
Everyone just assumed because Kim Min Jung told them.

49:33.940 --> 49:35.300
Furthermore...

49:35.300 --> 49:37.500
Lee So Jung's existence...

49:37.500 --> 49:39.160
When she spoke with her mother...

49:40.500 --> 49:42.790
We need to see it has 9:16.

49:43.410 --> 49:46.950
So the murder time was not at 9 PM.

49:46.950 --> 49:49.450
But starting from 9:16 AM...

49:49.450 --> 49:51.720
...to the skin clinic's first phone call...

49:51.720 --> 49:54.210
...which was at 11:17.

49:55.720 --> 49:58.930
So that means Shin Young Geun's alibi is gone.

49:58.930 --> 50:01.030
Because he was home at that time.

50:01.030 --> 50:05.070
We've confirmed Bae Seo Yeon and Kim Min Jung's alibi.

50:06.890 --> 50:08.680
Lee So Jung's murderer...

50:08.680 --> 50:10.480
...is Shin Young Geun.

50:11.160 --> 50:14.340
After killing his wife and placing her body...

50:14.340 --> 50:16.580
...into the bag, he went off to work.

50:16.580 --> 50:21.800
So the woman who he called at 9 PM was not Lee So Jung but Bae Seo Yeon.

50:22.860 --> 50:25.020
Then, he threw the bag away at Woo Eum Do.

50:27.310 --> 50:29.300
Hang up.

50:29.300 --> 50:31.190
You're going to miss your flight.

50:31.190 --> 50:33.890
Will you be okay without me there?

50:35.320 --> 50:36.900
Don't worry about me.

50:39.260 --> 50:42.050
Ever since the body was discovered...

50:42.050 --> 50:45.380
He put all the blame on Kim Min Jung.

50:46.370 --> 50:49.160
Although they made a deal,
the unreliable Kim Min Jung...

50:49.690 --> 50:51.520
...was made into the scapegoat.

50:54.620 --> 50:56.630
This is filthy work!

50:57.910 --> 51:00.100
Let's just arrest him!

51:00.100 --> 51:04.230
Calm down. Right now this is all circumstantial evidence.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.640
There's no way to prove it.

51:11.090 --> 51:12.260
Why not?

51:12.260 --> 51:16.150
He killed the only person who could ruin his alibi, Kim Min Jung.

51:16.150 --> 51:18.640
Bae Seo Yeon is staying silent.

51:18.640 --> 51:22.330
There's no reason for Shin Young Geun to confess.

51:24.470 --> 51:26.200
Why is this so complicated?

51:26.200 --> 51:28.520
Let's just catch him!

51:28.890 --> 51:32.030
We need to find evidence right away.

51:32.650 --> 51:34.830
There has to be something they left out.

51:44.590 --> 51:46.330
Difficult Shin Young Geun.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.630
Leaving another difficult challenge.

52:27.190 --> 52:30.070
In order to get what he wanted...

52:30.910 --> 52:32.920
He killed his wife's lover 7 years ago.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.770
And now he killed his wife.

52:37.440 --> 52:38.560
Did you know?

52:42.790 --> 52:46.800
But now, you're starting to look like that person.

52:47.940 --> 52:50.080
Putting the blame on Kim Min Jung.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.940
Faking a suicide.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.820
Don't you feel anything in your conscious?

52:57.360 --> 52:59.110
I never did that.

52:59.110 --> 53:01.040
You're the one who forged Kim Min Jung's will!

53:01.040 --> 53:03.680
The sleeping pills inside her car were yours!

53:05.750 --> 53:06.810
But still...

53:08.100 --> 53:09.860
You're going to continue lying?

53:14.570 --> 53:17.380
Accusing the cartel of silence...

53:17.380 --> 53:19.560
Being faithful and righteous...

53:20.440 --> 53:21.950
Where did that go?

53:28.580 --> 53:30.310
Just confess.

53:31.210 --> 53:32.310
That night...

53:34.180 --> 53:36.200
Why did you go to Woo Eun Do?

53:45.390 --> 53:47.980
I told you I was just out driving.

54:27.300 --> 54:29.860
I told you I was just out driving.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.520
Bae Seo Yeon isn't lying.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.210
She's been telling the truth.

54:52.460 --> 54:53.520
Truth?

54:54.470 --> 54:55.360
Are you sure?

54:56.810 --> 54:59.760
At first, I thought she was hiding something.

54:59.760 --> 55:03.450
But she's not hiding anything,
she's telling the facts.

55:03.450 --> 55:05.450
That doesn't make sense!

55:05.450 --> 55:09.990
So someone took Kim Min Jung's car and drove to Woo Eum Do...

55:09.990 --> 55:12.690
If it wasn't Kim Min Jung or Bae Seo Yeon...

55:12.690 --> 55:14.690
Who abandoned that bag?

55:17.500 --> 55:18.870
Shin Young Geun.

55:23.520 --> 55:27.260
He's not aware that she was involved in Kim Min Jung's death.

55:32.310 --> 55:33.430
Wait.

55:35.270 --> 55:38.840
Did we drag Bae Seo Yeon into Kim Min Jung's murder?

55:38.840 --> 55:42.500
It was her writing in the will and her sleeping pills...

55:42.500 --> 55:44.240
It's not easy but...

55:44.240 --> 55:45.670
Both are possible.

55:45.670 --> 55:50.150
Shin Young Geun could've easily copied Bae Seo Yeon's writing.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.440
Same for the sleeping pills.

55:53.540 --> 55:56.890
We saw Shin Young Geun way too nicely.

55:58.480 --> 56:02.420
There is no reason for Bae Seo Yeon to become the decisive factor.

56:03.130 --> 56:07.130
Although he may have used Bae Seo Yeon's trust in him...

56:07.130 --> 56:09.590
He doesn't trust anybody.

56:18.120 --> 56:21.610
But, why did he keep Bae Seo Yeon around this long?

56:22.460 --> 56:25.150
Making Kim Min Jung to be his wife's murderer...

56:25.150 --> 56:27.980
It would've been the perfect suicide plot.

56:29.160 --> 56:32.920
There's a reason why he made Bae Seo Yeon look like a murderer.

56:33.660 --> 56:36.620
There'd be no reason to keep her alive.

56:37.280 --> 56:39.190
Bae Seo Yeon...

56:39.190 --> 56:42.500
...probably caught on that he actually killed his own wife.

56:42.920 --> 56:44.870
There's a bone stuck in his throat.

56:46.160 --> 56:49.990
He'll do anything to take it out.

56:49.990 --> 56:51.890
You're saying there's something else he's going to do.

56:51.890 --> 56:55.090
Then, we should hurry and stop him!

56:55.090 --> 56:56.040
No.

56:57.650 --> 56:59.850
If this is a question nobody can solve...

57:01.400 --> 57:03.660
Then we need to find a way to solve it.

57:13.020 --> 57:15.300
- Yes?
- This is the NFS.

57:15.300 --> 57:17.300
There's something we found.

57:17.300 --> 57:18.330
Yes. Got it.

57:21.200 --> 57:24.430
The NFS found something and they asked us to come.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.680
Unique components were found in the bag that contained the body.

57:33.100 --> 57:35.480
Nitrogen, phosphorus?

57:35.850 --> 57:36.860
What is this?

57:37.630 --> 57:41.370
They're components found in the man-made fertilizers.

57:41.370 --> 57:42.670
What?

57:43.680 --> 57:46.660
Woo Eum Do has no need for those kind of fertilizers.

57:46.660 --> 57:49.810
What part of the bad had these components?

57:50.640 --> 57:56.270
On the handle and inside of the zipper areas.

57:58.710 --> 58:00.840
Inside the handle...

58:01.960 --> 58:04.300
In between the zipper...

58:14.490 --> 58:15.790
Detective Baek!

58:17.070 --> 58:18.060
You should come here!

58:21.040 --> 58:23.900
This is the same fertilizer found in the bag!

58:27.860 --> 58:30.350
Nitrogen... phosphate...

58:31.360 --> 58:32.490
That's right.

58:34.940 --> 58:36.210
Min Ho.

58:37.480 --> 58:40.100
We need to look back at the security cameras.

58:49.430 --> 58:50.800
Good work.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.510
What did the police say?

58:52.510 --> 58:54.190
They just asked random questions.

58:56.110 --> 58:58.120
I didn't say anything.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.570
Good job, Seo Yeon.

59:05.490 --> 59:08.700
Thanks. You're the only one who believes me.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.650
You must be tired.
Drink this.

59:22.230 --> 59:25.830
You believe in me too, right?

59:27.160 --> 59:28.420
Of course.

59:31.220 --> 59:33.010
Everything will be fine.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.940
Hello.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.650
Sorry it's so early.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:33.800
The murder suspect, Bae Seo Yeon was found dead last night.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.280
We'll need to have you come in as a reference.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:04.050
What's going on?

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:07.800
We were very shocked as well.

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.890
The two students who acted as an accomplice to Lee So Jung's...

01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:14.390
...murder also died with the truth.

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.830
I don't believe it.

01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:19.830
When I found out my wife was murdered...

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.830
Those kids were the ones who...

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.280
...helped me get through tough times.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.410
Some lies are more plausible than the truth.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.080
I'm sorry, So Jung.
Because of me...

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.300
But the timing is exquisite.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:46.660
The moment Kim Min Jung became a suspect...

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.170
She was already dead.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:52.830
When Bae Seo Yeon could reveal the truth, she was found dead too.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:57.030
Of course, whether it was an accident...

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.860
...or whether it was a suicide.
We'll have to keep-

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.110
It was probably a suicide.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:08.180
Mixing fire and water together is calling for suicide.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:12.130
Yesterday, they did a SFR testing in the laboratory...

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:14.990
...and there were no hazardous materials.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.360
It's strange.

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:24.130
How did you know that she died in the laboratory?

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.570
Is there a problem?

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:33.120
I didn't mention anything about where she was found dead.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.220
Last night...

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:38.870
I received a call.

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:42.180
And you were able to sleep after hearing the news?

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.620
When you were her professor?

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.390
Exactly who called?

01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:50.800
The case was to be considered a hush-hush event.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.200
Why is that so important?

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.000
Then, should I tell you something more important?

01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:01.940
You were looking all over the country for 3 months.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.930
But, you didn't come right away when the body was discovered.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.600
You were late this time.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:14.080
Only after seeing the skeleton on the news...

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.440
...and after seeing the internet articles...

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:19.680
You came 13 hours later.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.900
Did I?

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.390
I'm not sure.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.480
I had a lot of classes.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.460
I had so much to do.

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:34.020
I'm sure you were busy.

01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.870
You were plotting to get rid of Kim Min Jung.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.550
While cleverly trying to get rid of Bae Seo Yeon.

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:42.840
Are you crazy?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.350
Now that you've hit a dead end, you even blame family members?

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:53.390
Not family but the victim.

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:57.450
Lee So Jung was murdered on that morning.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:59.670
By her husband, Shin Young Geun.

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:01.950
You got rid of the bag yourself.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:13.470
3 days after the missing report, 9:22 AM.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.480
Rental car 04-3876.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.760
What are you talking about?

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.270
I was only looking for my wife.

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:28.020
Why would I kill my own wife?!

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:35.300
Because it's uncomfortable.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.590
What?

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.330
Because she found out about the nasty and filthy person you are.

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.240
This side of you.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.790
Seeing it yourself is interesting, huh?

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.710
I did it for revenge.

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:30.190
After they killed my wife,
I couldn't not do anything.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.750
You got revenge for your wife?

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.750
Seo Yeon liked me.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.380
She was a stalker.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:46.220
You don't know how uneasy I felt seeing her do things to get me.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.430
You probably know...

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:53.560
Kids who lack attention, cling onto the ones who give them support.

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:58.940
I felt sorry for her because she couldn't afford to go to school.

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:04.240
After the police investigation for yesterday... I'm confessing.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.870
Take me.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.280
I'll take the punishment.

01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:13.690
My wife will understand me.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:22.910
Right now, Shin Young Geun...

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.620
For the murder of your wife and for disposing the body...

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:35.279
And for the attempted murder of Bae Seo Yeon... You're under arrest.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.029
Attempted murder?

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:23.689
Seo Yeon.

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:25.700
These people are lying.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.540
You have to trust me.
You trust me, right?

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:28.630
Trust me until the end!

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:38.109
You worthless piece of trash.

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.500
If it wasn't for me,
you'd already be dead.

01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:51.510
Show some manners.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.029
She's a victim of an attempted murder.

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:56.960
The main witness to the Lee So Jung murder.

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:33.130
Do you think I'll end like this?

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.830
We should've smacked him.

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:15.300
He'll get smashed in hell anyway.

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:30.160
Sometimes...

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:34.570
The truth hurts as well.

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:44.290
But it'll heal faster than the hurt you get from believing in a lie.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:28.130
Senior...

01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:37.850
I have something to tell you.

01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:40.710
Is it important?

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.950
I don't think you're asking...

01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.830
...about life counseling.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.200
If you were hurt anyway...

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:12.680
The truth is better than the lie, right?

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:16.400
Sure.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:29.460
I think it's time for Director Yeo to know the truth.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.280
About Song Kyung Tae...

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:37.280
The truth...

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.290
Song Kyung Tae?

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:45.000
F?

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.670
Song Kyung Tae?

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.420
It's not over, huh?

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.170
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.100
She was making a demo for her audition.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:32.400
During the murder scene,
she was up on stage at that time.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.620
She can't see?

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.290
She has problems with her eyes, minor blindness.

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:40.500
What a unique wound.
Can she not be the witness?

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.860
I didn't know who did it...

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:48.800
She was murdered...

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:52.350
Behind closed doors...

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.700
You never know if he's hiding there.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.070
Make sure no one can leave.
Got it?
