And you'd be nothing without me.

of a new chapter head.

Yes, we are.

I will personally guarantee

29:25.981 --> 29:27.156
[chip beeps]

29:27.635 --> 29:28.854
Fuck him up, T-Dog.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.075
[T-Dog grunts]

29:34.337 --> 29:35.774
- [man yells]
- [thud]

29:36.383 --> 29:37.732
Now look,
if you don't have the money,

29:37.776 --> 29:38.951
you can just pay me
another time.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.953
- Slice him up.
- [Mike] I wouldn't do that

29:40.996 --> 29:42.041
if I were you.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.044
[T-Dog] Oh, geez!

29:46.045 --> 29:47.829
- [Mike] Drop the knife, mate.
- [T-Dog] Fuck!

29:49.091 --> 29:51.746
[yelling]
Broke my fucking shoulder.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.139
Yeah, well,
you tried to kill me, man.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.271
- I think we're even.
- [T-Dog] Fuck you!

29:56.185 --> 29:58.535
What are you pussies
waiting for? Get him!

29:59.536 --> 30:02.148
[grunting]

30:03.540 --> 30:05.716
- [thud]
- [man groans]

30:06.326 --> 30:10.721
- [Flick] Kid's got skills.
- Yeah... how about that?

30:12.506 --> 30:19.078
- [car engine revving]
- [tires screeching]

30:25.040 --> 30:27.738
[Ed cheers, laughs]

30:28.870 --> 30:31.568
[tires screeching]

30:42.362 --> 30:45.582
What are you waiting for, man?
Get in. Come on. Come on.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.020
[Ed] Buckle up!

30:53.416 --> 30:57.899
- Wasn't that K-Z's ride?
- [man crying]

31:00.554 --> 31:04.863
- [Ed laughing]
- Shit man!

31:05.341 --> 31:07.561
Dude! What was that, man?

31:07.953 --> 31:09.476
What? You saw that?
What happened to you?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.043
What happened to
"I got your back"?

31:11.086 --> 31:13.132
Clearly, you don't need
my help, mate.

31:13.610 --> 31:16.222
Problem is, I'm not the only one
watching, Mikey.

31:16.483 --> 31:19.399
What? What, we're being watched?
I didn't see anyone.

31:19.790 --> 31:20.791
And you won't.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.098
But that little display
back there is gonna help

31:23.142 --> 31:24.099
the others think
that you're legit.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.188
I mean, even if that dude
did need

31:26.232 --> 31:28.495
his ass handed back to him
by the real Kung Fu master, man.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.504
So, uh...

31:38.940 --> 31:40.115
what do we do now?

31:40.550 --> 31:43.249
- We? There is no we, Mike.
- Yeah.

31:44.119 --> 31:45.555
- I'm taking you home.
- [Mike scoffs]

31:45.599 --> 31:47.340
Oh, no, no,
not if they're watching me.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.384
No, I'm sticking to you.

31:49.777 --> 31:50.909
No, no, no, look,
that is not how this goes down.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.704
[T-Dog] Better give me
a hundred more reasons

32:03.747 --> 32:05.836
why me and the boys
don't end you right now.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.142
You did what I ask?

32:12.060 --> 32:15.107
[T-Dog] Oi, Squid!
You do as I ask?

32:20.634 --> 32:21.635
[Manson] You're SD?

32:23.115 --> 32:24.725
[T-Dog] That's right, old man.
Boy ain't safe nowhere.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.336
Well, I think we can help
each other out.

32:28.816 --> 32:31.732
Clean your shit up...
load your crew...

32:32.733 --> 32:35.040
and meet me here.
You'll get your chance.

32:35.344 --> 32:38.043
- [T-Dog] All right.
- [Flick] Oh, and T-Dog?

32:39.087 --> 32:42.134
Put a shirt on. Bitch tits.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.179
[Manson laughs]

32:44.919 --> 32:45.876
Okay.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.403
Get us back so I can see where
those two clowns are headed.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.494
[phone beeps]

32:54.929 --> 32:56.800
There's an applicator for that?

32:57.062 --> 33:00.500
Yeah...
there's an applicator for that.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.155
[Manson]
Yeah, of course there is.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.291
[Ed] Listen, it's like this,
Mikey.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.946
I am working, right?
You're pretending to work.

33:12.251 --> 33:16.907
Working, not working.
Real, fake. Coke, Pepsi.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.692
I'm the Coke, man.

33:19.519 --> 33:22.174
I am the fucking coke, man.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.003
I'm the Coke.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.528
[Ed snorts and exhales]

33:28.919 --> 33:30.791
I am the fucking Coke, man.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.971
Ed? Um...

33:38.625 --> 33:41.106
if you can guarantee my safety
at home, you know...

33:41.715 --> 33:45.066
then just drop me off
'cause I've got comics to read.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.377
[Ed scoffs]

33:51.638 --> 33:55.772
[engine revving]

33:56.121 --> 33:59.689
[Ed] Fuck it! Those things
will rot your brain, man.

34:12.876 --> 34:13.964
[Mike] What's this place?

34:14.007 --> 34:15.618
[Ed] It's one of my safe-houses.

34:15.661 --> 34:19.056
- [Mike] A safe-house. Really?
- [Ed] Yes, really.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.063
[Ed] Listen.
You don't touch anything.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.722
Ah! What'd I just say?
You don't touch anything?

34:34.637 --> 34:36.291
[Ed] Our primary
is Terry Winston.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.338
This guy started a meth lab
for one of the local gangs

34:39.380 --> 34:40.947
and he has outlived
his usefulness.

34:40.991 --> 34:44.386
- [Mike] That's a nice car.
- [Ed] Yeah, I thought so.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.215
Anyway, look,
the plan is to make it look

34:47.259 --> 34:48.956
like a gang war.
That's why I took that.

34:48.998 --> 34:51.828
Ed, what kind of club
are you in exactly?

34:53.873 --> 34:56.485
Plausible deniability
is a powerful ally.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.835
[Mike] I think we're
a little bit past that point.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.185
Don't you?

35:00.968 --> 35:02.317
Not even close, man.

35:08.497 --> 35:11.152
- We specialize.
- In?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.676
- [Ed] Killing.
- [Mike] Damn it, Ed.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.330
I thought you said
only a few were killers.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.419
Yeah, look, I know and I might
have relaxed the truth on that

35:17.463 --> 35:20.030
a little bit, Mikey.
But it was for your own good.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.467
I mean, who ever heard
of an assassin's club

35:21.510 --> 35:23.599
that was made up of killers?
Huh?

35:23.643 --> 35:24.948
But you don't need
to worry, man.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.559
I'm gonna make sure
you don't become a member.

35:26.950 --> 35:27.821
So trust me, man.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.040
Oh, considering the bullshit
you've spouted so far,

35:30.084 --> 35:31.172
I don't see why I should.

35:32.608 --> 35:33.870
It's nothing I can't get you out
of if you'd just do

35:33.914 --> 35:36.917
what I say this one time
on this one simple gig.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.487
If I don't like it... I'm out.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.316
Deal.

35:45.317 --> 35:46.709
Should be
honored though, recruit.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.364
- It's a very exclusive club.
- Sarah will be thrilled.

35:49.408 --> 35:51.105
Hey, you check that shit.
You hear me?

35:51.366 --> 35:53.586
If she finds out one thing
about this, we're all fucked.

35:53.890 --> 35:54.891
You copy that?

35:56.110 --> 35:57.198
Cheer up, man.

35:57.764 --> 35:58.895
It's like an opportunity for us

35:58.939 --> 36:00.201
to get to hang out
like old times, man.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.202
- Ed.
- Don't you reckon?

36:01.246 --> 36:02.160
- Ed.
- Huh?

36:03.465 --> 36:06.076
- I'm not killing anyone for you.
- Yeah, I know.

36:35.584 --> 36:38.065
[Manson] Oh, excellent!
Fantastic!

36:38.108 --> 36:40.415
I didn't think you'd be able
to access it that quick.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.765
Start recording as soon
as you--

36:42.809 --> 36:44.114
- [girl crying]
- [Manson] Hang on.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.334
Will you be quiet
while I'm on the phone?

36:51.905 --> 36:55.125
Yeah. No, no, no, no.
It's all good.

36:55.952 --> 36:58.216
- [girl sobbing]
- Really?

36:58.868 --> 37:02.394
Huh! Nice work.
How long will it take?

37:02.742 --> 37:04.047
Help.

37:04.091 --> 37:06.224
Okie dokie. I'll be there
shortly, okay?

37:06.746 --> 37:08.226
[crying] Help! Help!

37:09.270 --> 37:11.751
- Help. Help--
- [smack]

37:12.012 --> 37:13.840
Did I say you could speak?

37:15.189 --> 37:19.628
God! Damn! Wah wah! Here.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.503
If you hurry, you might
get there first.

37:26.635 --> 37:27.636
Yeah?

37:29.508 --> 37:31.988
Don't wanna hang around?
See Cindy become a cyclops?

37:38.343 --> 37:39.735
Now where were we?

37:40.127 --> 37:42.042
[cackles]

37:44.392 --> 37:48.570
[engine revving]

38:01.366 --> 38:03.759
- [Mike] Ed, they have cameras.
- [Ed] Yeah, I know.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.242
- Oh shit!
- Relax.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.505
[metal door creaking]

38:25.085 --> 38:26.086
All right.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.436
After I get out...

38:29.829 --> 38:31.787
you count to five,
you shoot anything that moves.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.703
And if you have to speak,
use a Russian accent.

38:35.922 --> 38:36.923
You ready?

38:41.449 --> 38:42.407
I'm just kidding, man.

38:43.712 --> 38:44.409
Listen, you keep
your shit together, you hear?

38:44.452 --> 38:45.497
- Yeah.
- All right.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.455
And try not to look
so scared, man.

38:53.069 --> 38:55.681
- That's a good look.
- Shut up.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.686
Un-fucking-believable.

39:02.427 --> 39:05.517
Hello. Anyone here?

39:10.173 --> 39:13.307
Where the fuck is everybody,
man? Hey, you Serrig?

39:13.829 --> 39:15.657
I'm Mark, Tejo sent me.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.877
Tell me, is this how
you look after an SD Investment?

39:18.225 --> 39:19.357
- Huh?
- Where's Katie?

39:20.793 --> 39:21.707
Don't you fucking answer
my question with a question.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.408
This where you keep the girls?

39:39.246 --> 39:42.423
Okay, okay, man.
This is bullshit.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.252
I want your crew
out the front now. Let's go.

39:46.775 --> 39:48.734
Come on, girls. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

39:48.995 --> 39:50.866
Not the girls,
you fucking junkie.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.651
You girls get back to work.
Come on, back to work.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.696
Everybody back to work.
Come on. Chop chop.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.743
Where are the boys, man?

39:59.179 --> 40:00.441
The men that were sent here

40:00.485 --> 40:02.051
to keep this place
locked down, man.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.749
There ain't no one
watching the girls,

40:04.010 --> 40:05.577
there ain't no one
out the front.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.406
Ed was right to send me, man.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.060
These motherfuckers are wasting
our time, huh?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.802
Do you want me to call Tejo?

40:15.717 --> 40:18.241
Huh? Is that what you want?
Hmm?

40:21.506 --> 40:23.812
- All right.
- [phone beeps]

40:24.160 --> 40:26.511
No, no, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.949
- [man moaning]
- [woman laughing]

40:29.992 --> 40:32.342
[horn blares]

40:47.749 --> 40:50.491
Is that everyone? Where's T-Dog?

40:51.057 --> 40:52.450
In emergency.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.324
[gunshots]

41:02.808 --> 41:03.939
Oh fuck!

41:05.027 --> 41:07.334
[wheezes] Fuck!
Did you see that guy?

41:08.161 --> 41:10.250
I thought I was gonna
have to reload, man.

41:10.859 --> 41:13.340
Come on, come on, let's go.
Get moving!

41:13.949 --> 41:15.995
Go, Mike! Go watch the door.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.740
Mikey! Go watch the door.
No following me,

41:21.783 --> 41:25.178
no street fights.
Watch the door. Go on, go, go.

41:25.221 --> 41:26.092
Come on.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.268
Get your little chicken leg
in there you motherf--

41:51.073 --> 41:53.946
- [screaming]
- [gunshots]

41:59.604 --> 42:02.389
[women screaming]

42:07.829 --> 42:10.484
Ed. Ed. Ed. You there?

42:10.789 --> 42:14.575
[person choking]

42:17.317 --> 42:18.318
[gun cocks]

42:19.145 --> 42:20.842
Let's see him dodge this.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.671
I didn't know
you were left-handed.

42:25.455 --> 42:28.284
[person choking]

42:28.589 --> 42:31.723
[in Russian accent]
It's time to be going, comrade.

42:31.766 --> 42:35.553
[person choking]

42:35.770 --> 42:37.032
[gun cocks]

42:45.388 --> 42:47.782
[person choking]

42:48.391 --> 42:51.220
[Mike] Don't tell me
we came here so you could score.

42:52.265 --> 42:54.572
Whoa, whoa! What the hell
are you doing?

42:55.398 --> 42:57.487
[Ed] Haven't you heard
of karmic justice?

42:57.792 --> 42:59.620
[Mike] I don't think this
is what Buddha had in mind.

42:59.881 --> 43:01.622
I don't know. Maybe not, man.

43:01.666 --> 43:04.538
But Mandela, now he'd be able
to shit like a fat kid on cake.

43:05.844 --> 43:07.454
Whoa. Man, who's watching
the door?

43:07.497 --> 43:09.630
Forget the door! What the hell
is wrong with you?

43:10.196 --> 43:11.458
Are you shitting me, man?

43:12.546 --> 43:13.895
I'm sorry this little scene
disturbs you,

43:13.939 --> 43:15.549
but this is my job.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.159
Yours is to watch
the fucking door.

43:17.203 --> 43:19.379
Are you doing it? No. Why--
what-- Are you lost man?

43:19.422 --> 43:21.468
Do I need to put a sign?
Look, there is a sign, huh?

43:21.511 --> 43:22.469
I was worried, okay?

43:23.775 --> 43:24.689
- The door, now!
- The door's fine. There's no one

43:24.732 --> 43:27.213
- around for miles.
- [door creaks]

43:32.218 --> 43:33.611
Yeah, well,
that's not the point, Mikey.

43:34.220 --> 43:36.396
When you say you're gonna do
something, man, you do it.

43:36.831 --> 43:38.616
You don't just up and leave
whenever you feel like it.

43:38.659 --> 43:41.575
[scoffs] There it is.
This isn't about the door.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.272
You're still choked that I left
the service. Now,

43:43.316 --> 43:44.665
how long have you been waiting
to say that?

43:44.970 --> 43:46.232
About an hour.

43:46.275 --> 43:47.668
And I probably could've waited
longer, Mikey,

43:47.712 --> 43:49.757
but I'm super fucking pissed
with you right now, man.

43:50.192 --> 43:51.498
And we're at it...

43:51.803 --> 43:53.021
when were you gonna tell me
about Sarah?

43:53.718 --> 43:56.372
[Ed] Oh no, no, no.
You're in no position...

43:56.416 --> 43:58.113
[indistinct chatter]

43:58.853 --> 44:01.116
[Mike] ...I couldn't talk to you
on account of you being dead.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.031
You had no idea
what things were like, Ed.

44:03.075 --> 44:05.207
I was the one that helped them
get through after you were gone.

44:05.251 --> 44:08.167
In turn, Sarah helped me accept
that life goes on, all right?

44:08.210 --> 44:10.256
So like it or not, things
have changed, Ed.

44:10.299 --> 44:12.432
Nothing has changed, man.
You can't commit to anything.

44:12.824 --> 44:15.304
[Mike] ...rich coming from you.
Anything else you wanna say?

44:15.348 --> 44:17.089

each other in how long?

44:17.132 --> 44:18.743
- Not long enough, man.
- I'm sorry. When did you turn

44:18.786 --> 44:20.222

44:20.266 --> 44:22.398
[Ed] Oh, I've always been
an asshole, man.

a fucking pussy.

44:31.843 --> 44:32.887
- [Ed] No, man.
- Why?

44:32.931 --> 44:34.280
[Ed] Because we got

44:57.782 --> 44:59.653

from upstairs in the office.

01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:07.299
I tried to explain to The Five
that this was going to happen,

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:08.735
but they just couldn't see it.

01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:10.041
[Manson] And now
I can show them.

01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:12.260
Oh Marilyn,
did you wet the bed, did you?

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:13.522
[Manson] Man, almost.

01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:16.308
I've been pissing myself
all morning with laughter.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.572
I happen to cross a certain set
of video files Number One

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.009
will find, um, very interesting.

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:25.622
Me and his prize-winning beagle.
How'd you get that?

01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:28.015
The same way I got
everything else on you, Edward.

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:29.321
I'm just that good.

01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:31.323
[Manson] I even know
about the lies

01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:33.542
you've been telling. Yeah.

01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:35.719
I know your little secret.

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.766
But that's not why I'm calling. Turn on your TV.

01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:48.906
[reporter on TV]
Thanks for that, Jeff.

01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.821
Moving back to our main story
this morning...

01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:53.258
[Reporter on TV]
...late last night...

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.959
- Ah! Good morning.
- [Mike] Hey babe.

01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:04.182
- What are you making?
- Eggs.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.491
God. You don't hear that
everyday.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.972
- [Sarah] Serves them right.
- What?

01:01:12.277 --> 01:01:14.888
A bunch of gangbangers shot
each other downtown last night.

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:17.325
[reporter] ...not willing
to comment on the exact cause

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:19.023
of the shooting at this time.

01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:22.243
- And you got a message.
- [reporter] ...they found

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:24.811
a large amount of drugs
and manufacturing equipment.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:27.509
One of the largest finds so far this year.

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:31.818
The lone survivor, also
believed to be an SD member...

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.167
[knocking on door]

01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:35.953
- [Sarah] I'll get it.
- No, no, no.

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:38.433
- No, no, no, no.
- What are you doing?

01:01:38.477 --> 01:01:40.087
Nothing. We-- we gotta go.

01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:41.872
- [knocking on door]
- [club member] Michael.

01:01:41.915 --> 01:01:44.048
- It doesn't look like nothing.
- Oh. Yup. Okay.

01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:46.703
Come on, Michael.
We know you're in there.

01:01:48.922 --> 01:01:50.576
Okay. Yup, you're right.
It's something.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:54.058
It's something big. I think
those guys are hitmen.

01:01:54.493 --> 01:01:57.061
- [scoffs] Whatever?
- [banging on door]

01:01:57.104 --> 01:02:00.107
[club member] Michael,
we don't want to hurt you.

01:02:00.151 --> 01:02:02.719
We just want to talk to you.

01:02:05.896 --> 01:02:07.201
- Okay, let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.291
- You can't say it like that.
- I beg your pardon?

01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:13.338
Don't you watch any TV?
When people say stuff like that,

01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:15.079
they're just gonna whack
somebody.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:18.778
I was going to show him
a card.

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:22.390
Oh great. Show him a card.
Oh it's all good, mate.

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:25.219
Michael.
We're friends of Eddie's.

01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:29.702
[thud]

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:35.447
[Jeff] Ah f--

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.321
[phone beeps] Yeah,
bring the car out in front.

01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:42.367
Yeah, he's going OJ.

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.673
Why's he going for orange juice?

01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:46.850
- He's running.
- Oh.

01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:49.200
[Sarah]
Mike, where are we going?

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:54.379
- [Mike] Oh just, um...
- What? What are you doing?

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.207
Are those guys really hitmen?

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:59.427
Come on. Let's-- let's race.
Yeah, let's race.

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:00.646
Come on, let's race. It's fun.

01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:02.082
Mike, I thought
you were joking around.

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:03.823
- Who are those guys?
- I don't know. Not sure.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:05.390
- Then why are we running?
- Okay.

01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:07.261
I had a little bit
of a weird day yesterday

01:03:07.305 --> 01:03:08.480
and things got a little...

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.612
- There he is
- [Mike] Come on. Let's go.

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:11.744
Gotta run. Come on.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.182
Quick. Get Manson on the phone.
Let him know.

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:23.495
[phone rings]

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:27.891
- [Manson] Yeah.
- [man speaking gibberish]

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:29.631
- What do you mean?
- [man speaking gibberish]

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:31.242
What do you mean
you had a problem with him?

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:34.245
[man speaking gibberish]

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.552
- [panting] Oh geez.
- Mike,

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:40.338
will you slow down a minute?
This is ridiculous.

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:45.604
Hey, hey Michael. You tired?
I'll give you a lift.

01:03:45.647 --> 01:03:46.823
I'll just pop the boot.

01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:48.085
- [Mike] Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.783
- No, we're good. Thanks.
- Michael! Who was that?

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:58.138
[Mike] Look. I realize
this is probably very confusing,

01:03:58.182 --> 01:03:59.313
[panting]
but I promise I'll tell you

01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:00.619
everything once we get there.

01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:02.882
- [Sarah] Where?
- [Mike] To the safe-house.

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:03.927
[Sarah] Oh, to the safe-house.

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:05.537
When the hell did you get
a safe-house, Mike?

01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:07.582
- What do you do when I'm away?
- Whoa, whoa! This is not good.

01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:11.804
Okay. Babe,
you gotta go, all right?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.501
Just cut through the park,
and I'll catch up with you,

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:14.763
- all right?
- Fine. I'll go. But this...

01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.156
not over.

01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:28.777
Michael. Why are you running?

01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:31.519
What? My girlfriend and I
go jogging every morning.

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.652
You two should try it.

01:04:33.695 --> 01:04:35.828
We ain't gonna hurt you.
No one is going to arrest you.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.265
No shit, Sherlock.
Cops aren't as ugly as you lot.

01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:39.614
Is that so?

01:04:41.399 --> 01:04:43.401
- You need to come with us.
- No, no, no, no.

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:45.272
You need to leave me alone.

01:04:45.707 --> 01:04:47.579
I don't think
you've got a choice.

01:04:48.014 --> 01:04:49.015
Don't!

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:54.064
[grunting]

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.998
[Manson] Are you serious?
It was straightforward.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.000
Shit!

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.741
- [Flick] Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- [Manson] Oh, fuck me sideways.

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:21.439
Change of plan. Follow her.

01:05:24.181 --> 01:05:25.922
Where do you think you're going,
sweetheart?

01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:28.228
[bongos being played]

01:05:35.192 --> 01:05:36.584
[Manson] That's it.
Just over here.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:57.127
- Mi... Mike!
- Hey, look out behind! Behind!

01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:58.780
Behind you!

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:04.569
Ah! Little rest after your run.

01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:19.845
[Manson] Okay, go.

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:32.814
- Hey, Mikey!
- [Mike] Hey.

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:34.947
Could you save us the trouble.
Just borrowing some gear.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.042
Sick pajamas.

01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:50.006
Have you lost
your fucking marbles?

01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:52.095
This isn't why we're here.

01:06:52.138 --> 01:06:53.966
We're supposed
to bring him in easy.

01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:57.187
Easy? Oh yeah, yeah.
Tell that to the B team.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:59.232
They're at the top of the hill
sweeping up their own teeth.

01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:02.888
Can't take Mohammed
to the mountain,

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:04.498
you take his girlfriend.

01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:07.762
He'll go wherever the fuck
you want. [laughs]

01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:48.107
The Five are gonna grind
your balls when they find out

01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:49.543
- about this.
- Bullshit.

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:50.501
They'll thank me.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.808
This chick's like a two-for-one
deal. Get us to the yard.

01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:12.610
Fuck. Damn it!

01:08:42.944 --> 01:08:46.948
[Flick] What the f--
He's behind us?

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.689
[Manson] Yeah,
but he's only on a skateboard.

01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:50.778
No way he's gonna catch us
on that thing.

01:09:02.964 --> 01:09:04.051
[Manson] Turn left up ahead.

01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:05.662
He won't be able
to follow us in traffic.

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:26.466
[car horn blares]

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.301
[Manson] He's gone. Told you.

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:39.871
- [Flick] Hey! Get off!
- [Mike] Sarah!

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:41.176
[Mike] Baby!

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.223
[Mike] Sarah! Sarah, wake up!

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:47.705
Fuck off!

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.011
[Manson] Mike,
it's the middle of the road.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:53.058
- Sarah!
- [Manson] There, there.

01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:55.191
[Flick]
Yeah, I see it. I see it.

01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:57.280
[Manson]
Escape through this, Mikey.

01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:06.114
Up there.
That hill will stop him.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:10.031
[Flick] Huh.
He'll never get up here.

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:35.535
Where are you, Mikey?
Where are you?

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:46.851
Holy shit!

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:54.772
I'm seeing him.

01:10:58.558 --> 01:11:00.430
What's this guy's problem
anyway?

01:11:01.735 --> 01:11:04.042
Give it a bit more speed.
He's got no chance.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:05.957
All right. Hold on.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.880
[Manson] How hard is it
to outrun a skateboard?

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.403
I'm trying!

01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.501
I've had enough
of this bullshit.

01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:31.765
- Playtime over.
- [gun cocks]

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:36.117
[gunshots]

01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:38.990
[Mike] Whoa, whoa!

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.133
[Flick] Not today, Spider-man.

01:11:52.569 --> 01:11:53.570
Fuck!

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:00.446
Well, that's just great.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.328
[doorbell rings]

01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:14.982
[buzzer buzzes]

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.378
Hey, thanks for coming, Mike.

01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:21.859
Now, listen, listen.
Look, I know you're shitting

01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:23.077
on me right now, man.
You know what?

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.210
And I deserve it, you know?
I really do.

01:12:25.253 --> 01:12:27.125
But we have to put that shit
behind us right now, man,

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:28.474
'cause we-- Dude, what--

01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:30.389
Some heavies from the club
rocked up just as I got

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:33.566
your text, okay? You said run
and so we ran and they started--

01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:36.352
I didn't say run, Mikey, I said
ASAP man. That doesn't mean

01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:38.615
skip breakfast
and don't put your pants on.

01:12:38.919 --> 01:12:42.314
Whoa... did you say we?

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.968
Sarah's retreat
got rained out last night.

01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:46.013
When those dudes rocked up,
we were on the news and--

01:12:46.057 --> 01:12:48.059
I mean, I just freaked out.
I couldn't just leave her there

01:12:48.102 --> 01:12:49.452
and then-- and then
your fucking girlfriend

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.105
from the other night
just rolled up and took her--

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:52.498
- Who? Manson?
- Yeah.

01:12:55.066 --> 01:12:57.242
Oh, that fucking idiot.

01:12:58.112 --> 01:13:00.811
Oh man, I knew
he was gonna mess this all up.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:05.032
He can't help himself, can he?
That fucking ego fucking maniac.

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:06.817
[crash]

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.949
That's it man!
I'm gonna end this guy!

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:10.429
Whoa, whoa.
Do you know where he is?

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:12.039
You know
where he's taking her, right?

01:13:13.084 --> 01:13:14.477
Fuck!

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:20.744
[Manson] Check this out...

01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:25.401
[indistinct chatter]

01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:42.026
Hey, boss. She's waking up.

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:46.944
Is she now?

01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:49.947
That's about time.

01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:53.429
All right there.
Got a lot to talk about.

01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:55.735
Here. Have a drink.

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.564
Drink up.

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:01.785
I promise you. It's just water.

01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:06.485
That's a good girl.
Excuse me for a second.

01:14:22.936 --> 01:14:25.025
- Showing me up like that.
- [phone ringing]

the deadline? Well, I can't.

01:14:31.858 --> 01:14:32.816
Yep?

01:14:32.859 --> 01:14:36.994
Hey boss. It's me... Manson.

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:41.085
Yeah. Yeah. You're not going
to believe this.

01:14:43.174 --> 01:14:44.480
You did what?

01:14:46.394 --> 01:14:48.396
- I just-- I just thought--
- What?

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.486
That you were smarter than us?

01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:52.400
[Boss] That you could do
a better job?

01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:53.489
No, I've got something to show--

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:54.794
[Boss] Listen, you muppet.

01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:58.145
You gotta talk to Eddie
and smooth this shit out.

01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:59.712
And if I suspect
for one moment...

01:14:59.756 --> 01:15:01.018
- [man screams]
- ...you're playing one

01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:02.933

little games with that girl...

01:15:03.673 --> 01:15:06.023
I'll come down there
myself. Capeesh?

01:15:06.066 --> 01:15:11.811
Yeah. Thanks... for nothing.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:20.516
Normally we'd like to keep
things a little more discrete

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:21.473
than this...

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:23.997
but your brother's given me
no choice.

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:28.785
Mi... Mike's not my brother,
he's my fiancé.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.353
- [Sarah yells]
- Did I say boyfriend?

01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:35.705
- Ed?
- [Manson chuckles]

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:40.840
Yes, you dopey bitch.
Welcome to the conversation.

01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:43.887
You twisted prick.
My brother's dead.

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:48.108
[Sarah yells]
I'm telling you the truth.

01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:50.023
He was killed in action
years ago.

01:15:51.372 --> 01:15:52.939
Look, I don't know
what you think Mike's done,

01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:55.028
but it has nothing to do
with Ed.

01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:59.555
Oh. Of course not.
You're gonna love this.

01:16:02.427 --> 01:16:03.559
[Ed on TV] Little help, please?

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.213
[gunshots in video]

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:08.651
[Mike on TV] I don't know.
What'd you have me do?

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:10.566
Yeah?

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:18.661
[gunshots in video]

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.578

01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:28.192
[Manson sighs]

01:16:31.717 --> 01:16:32.979
Call your brother.

01:16:35.286 --> 01:16:39.072
- Don't know how.
- No. Call your brother!

01:16:39.464 --> 01:16:41.727
Call your brother! Call him!

01:16:42.075 --> 01:16:43.773
- Call your brother!
- Okay!

01:16:43.816 --> 01:16:45.731
- Do it now! Call him!
- Okay!

01:16:46.297 --> 01:16:48.038

[Sarah] I will.
Just gotta find the number.

01:17:07.492 --> 01:17:10.756
- Sit your ass down.
- There's no reception.

01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:15.935
Oh. Okay. Make it quick.

01:17:20.548 --> 01:17:22.681
- Call your brother.
- Yeah.

01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:27.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get her. Get her.

Oh for God's sake. Come on.

01:17:31.211 --> 01:17:32.430
- Jeff, get in there.
- [Sarah] Get off!

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:33.736
[Manson] Get her hand.

01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:35.999
[Sara yelling]
Let-- let me go!

01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:40.220
[Manson]
Hey. Tough day, big fella.

01:17:41.178 --> 01:17:43.223
Didn't break a nail, did ya?
And you--

01:17:43.571 --> 01:17:45.356
Stupidity must be
a family trait.

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:47.924
Do you wanna chain her up,
boys? Come on. Let's go.

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:48.838
Grab her legs.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:50.970
- And get the handcuffs.
- Let me go! Get off!

01:17:52.102 --> 01:17:54.713
Okay, so we... came out here.

01:17:55.322 --> 01:17:57.890
Right? And I lost them
somewhere around there.

01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:00.023
- From your place?
- Yeah.

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:02.242
- That's awesome, man.
- Well, what fucking good is it?

01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:04.810
She's gone
and it's my fault, man.

01:18:04.854 --> 01:18:06.594
No. No, it's not.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:08.684
Manson's my problem, man.

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:11.121
That's the whole reason
I've stayed hidden.

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:12.644
So things like this
wouldn't happen, man.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.515
You, mom, Sarah,
the kids across the street.

01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:16.126
It doesn't matter.
If Manson finds a weak spot,

01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:19.695
he'll squeeze.
[Ed sighs]

01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:22.610
I'm gonna get her back, Ed.

01:18:23.786 --> 01:18:24.917
I know you are, man.

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:27.311
And I wasn't lying when I said--

01:18:27.615 --> 01:18:31.271
You know, I have been lying,
Mikey, but I wasn't lying

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:32.751
when I said
that we're a tight group,

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:34.710
all right? It might take me
a few more phone calls,

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.668
- but I'll find her.
- [phone chimes]

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:45.024
You might not have to, man.
That. That is why I love her.

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:48.724
Oh, dude,
I know this place, man.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:51.117
This is an old clubhouse, man.
Yeah.

01:18:51.422 --> 01:18:53.337
Oh, I don't know, man.
Manson's not the coolest kid

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.731
on the block, but he does have
some sort of pull.

01:18:55.774 --> 01:18:57.733
That's until everyone finds out
that I'm his new boss.

01:18:58.211 --> 01:18:59.735
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.650
Yeah. All right, I'm yet to
accept though, yeah.

01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:40.336
[guns cock]

01:24:46.603 --> 01:24:48.387
- [Max grunts]
- [thud]

01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:51.695
Max? Shit. Shit.

01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:55.264
- [man groans]
- [thud]

01:24:58.789 --> 01:25:00.921
[Ed] Nice.
Two more unconscious bodies.

01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:02.662
Would you quit doing that?
Please?

01:25:03.315 --> 01:25:04.403
[gunshot]

01:25:04.447 --> 01:25:05.709
Don't have a cry, come on.
Let's go.

01:25:05.752 --> 01:25:06.666
[gunshot]

01:25:10.192 --> 01:25:12.324
[Mike] I just don't understand
why you have to shoot everyone

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:13.499
all the time.

01:25:13.891 --> 01:25:15.153
Look, I know
this isn't your thing,

01:25:15.197 --> 01:25:16.894
but don't make it
boring for me, man.

01:25:16.937 --> 01:25:18.374
Well, if you were a little
more creative,

01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:19.940
you wouldn't have to,
you know, keep killing people

01:25:19.984 --> 01:25:20.985
all the time.

01:25:23.509 --> 01:25:26.947
Look, you can go if you like.
I've got it from here.

01:25:27.687 --> 01:25:29.733
Chances are they're doing this
to get to me anyway.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.649
You wouldn't have to
if it wasn't for me. All right?

01:25:32.953 --> 01:25:33.911
All set?

01:25:35.652 --> 01:25:37.871
I know, I know.
Everyone's pissed at me.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.134
Blah, blah, blah.

01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:42.920
What you gonna do about it?

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:50.797
Out of the way, Mike.
Move, move!

01:25:55.585 --> 01:25:57.152
- Happy?
- Thanks.

01:26:07.423 --> 01:26:09.773
Jesus! Sarah. Hey.

01:26:13.211 --> 01:26:14.821
- It's not her.
- Thank fuck for that.

01:26:14.865 --> 01:26:15.953
Come on. Come on.

01:26:15.996 --> 01:26:17.302
Man didn't do this,
I mean what if--

01:26:17.346 --> 01:26:18.564
No, no.
If Manson wants to hurt her,

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:20.566
he's gonna make sure we watch.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:26:26.529 --> 01:26:28.270
- [man 1] What's up?
- [man 2] She passed out again.

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:33.231
Just wait, all right?

01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:36.103
You go around the back. I'll run
point on the hole for two.

01:26:36.147 --> 01:26:37.235
Go that way.

01:26:41.065 --> 01:26:42.066
Don't be late.

01:26:43.154 --> 01:26:44.155
Don't be crazy.

01:26:45.765 --> 01:26:46.766
That's our motto.

01:26:55.732 --> 01:26:57.342
[guard] No. No, nothing, really.

01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:00.127
Of course
I haven't been drinking.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.174
Yeah, that's rich
coming from you.

01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:09.702
Yeah, yeah. I'll make sure
I keep an eye out. [phone beeps]

01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:12.052
[Mike whistles]

01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:14.533
- Where's the service here?
- Yeah, pretty ordinary.

01:27:14.577 --> 01:27:15.752
What the f--

01:27:20.191 --> 01:27:22.976
- Mike.
- Sarah.

01:27:26.893 --> 01:27:29.853
- Are you all right?
- No. I'm a fucking hostage.

01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:31.985
Not to mention that the guy
that took me said

01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:33.944
that Ed is still alive
and you knew all about it.

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:35.598
[chains clinking]

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.690
Look, first of all...
The guy that took you, okay?

01:27:40.994 --> 01:27:42.431
Right,
he's a complete mental case.

01:27:42.474 --> 01:27:44.955
Secondly, what would I be doing
with your dead brother?

01:27:56.923 --> 01:27:59.274
[Mike laughs] Hell yeah!

01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:04.453
Oh I-- I-- How--
how much did you see?

01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:06.716
Enough to know that if you
don't tell me what the hell

01:28:06.759 --> 01:28:09.371
is going on here, you may
as well disappear as well.

01:28:09.762 --> 01:28:12.678
Where has he been? How long
have you known about it?

01:28:12.722 --> 01:28:14.289
Two days. Okay? All right,
I swear

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:16.726
I literally bumped into him
the other night in the street.

01:28:16.769 --> 01:28:17.640
Where is he now?

01:28:18.902 --> 01:28:19.816
[club member]
That's a very good question.

01:28:21.687 --> 01:28:22.688
Michael!

01:28:23.602 --> 01:28:26.518
[laughs] Calm down, Michael.

01:28:26.997 --> 01:28:29.260
Now that you're here,
it won't be long.

01:28:29.652 --> 01:28:32.132
One of The Five is coming
to sort this out.

01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:35.397
I get nervous in interviews.
Can we do this by e-mail?

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.789
One of the five what?

01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:41.316
She really has no idea, has she?

01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:45.842
Well, you see, Sarah.
Your brother risked

01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:48.148
a certain level of exposure
that the members

01:28:48.192 --> 01:28:50.716
of the Hunter's club found
highly dis--

01:28:52.544 --> 01:28:54.590
[high pitched droning]

01:29:01.597 --> 01:29:04.382
- Eddie
- Hey, rat face. How are you?

01:29:04.991 --> 01:29:06.471
- Better I get this.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no!

01:29:06.515 --> 01:29:07.820
The guard's got the keys.

01:29:07.864 --> 01:29:10.606
Okay, better.
Go, get up. Up up.

01:29:12.434 --> 01:29:13.870
Come on, Sarah. Let's go.

01:29:27.449 --> 01:29:28.711
[Sarah screams]

01:29:32.976 --> 01:29:34.847
[gunshots]

01:29:41.158 --> 01:29:42.289
[gun clicks]

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:50.123
[men grunt]

01:29:54.867 --> 01:30:00.786
[grunting]

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:33.253
[grunting]

01:31:22.346 --> 01:31:29.309
[Sarah pants]

01:31:32.008 --> 01:31:33.488
[both laughing]

01:31:37.187 --> 01:31:38.710
[Ed] Hey-- Oh! Hey!

01:31:38.754 --> 01:31:41.408
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey. You all right?

01:31:41.626 --> 01:31:43.454
- [Ed laughs]
- All right.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:46.239
- Hey. Let's not tell mum.
- Shut up!

01:31:48.154 --> 01:31:50.983
- Hey there, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:31:51.027 --> 01:31:52.289
[door opens]

01:31:53.464 --> 01:31:54.552
[camera clicks]

01:31:54.596 --> 01:31:55.814
What a beautiful moment.

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:59.078
Oh. That's going straight
in the Facebook.

01:32:01.254 --> 01:32:04.257
I helped
a brother and sister reunite

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.346
after a tragic separation.

01:32:09.045 --> 01:32:11.177
Then I gouged
my fucking eyeballs out!

01:32:13.658 --> 01:32:14.659
Edward.

01:32:16.835 --> 01:32:19.795
- Where have you been?
- Around.

01:32:21.927 --> 01:32:24.190
[Ed] Take her back to my place.
I'll distract him.

01:32:26.584 --> 01:32:29.848
- I'm guessing this is your idea.
- Yeah.

01:32:30.936 --> 01:32:33.417
- Where's The First?
- On his way.

01:32:49.085 --> 01:32:50.129
Did you really not know

01:32:50.173 --> 01:32:51.043
- about Eddie?
- Uh-huh.

01:32:52.479 --> 01:32:53.480
- Then why are they after you?
- Because I screwed up.

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:54.786
And screwing up
around these guys

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:57.136
- gets you killed.
- [gunshot]

01:32:59.486 --> 01:33:01.358
- I have to go back.
- And do what?

01:33:01.401 --> 01:33:03.316
I'm not quite sure. But look,
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.361
about Ed and just--

01:33:05.928 --> 01:33:07.973
everything, but we don't have
much time to talk right now.

01:33:08.017 --> 01:33:08.974
- All right?
- You're right.

01:33:09.018 --> 01:33:10.410
- No, no, no, no.
- No!

01:33:10.672 --> 01:33:12.543
He's my brother.
I'm going back with you.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.371
Look. I know what's going
through your mind right now.

01:33:14.414 --> 01:33:16.721
I know what you're thinking,
all right? But just trust me.

01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:20.203
Please. I want you to find
someplace to hide.

01:33:20.507 --> 01:33:24.250
Just like paintball.
Stay low and... don't get shot.

01:33:24.686 --> 01:33:27.123
Can you do that for me? Please?

01:33:28.646 --> 01:33:30.866
- Yeah.
- Go, go.

01:34:03.202 --> 01:34:06.510
[woman moaning]

01:34:12.777 --> 01:34:19.523
[Flick pants and moans]

01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:25.616
- [Sarah grunts]
- [Flick moans]

01:34:32.014 --> 01:34:36.148
- Oh.
- [Flick groans]

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.721
Can't you bleed any faster man?
Come on.

01:34:44.243 --> 01:34:46.115
What is it with you
with the ladies, Manson?

01:34:46.593 --> 01:34:48.987
I saw the finger painting
you did on the girl outside.

01:34:49.422 --> 01:34:51.120
Real piece of work.
You know that?

01:34:52.469 --> 01:34:54.776
I'm a fucking Picasso
compared to you two clowns.

01:34:55.733 --> 01:34:58.780
That girl's a piece of art.
Why can't anyone see that?

01:34:59.041 --> 01:35:00.346
French wouldn't call that art.

01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:02.958
Yeah? Well,
when The First gets here...

01:35:04.046 --> 01:35:06.222
he's gonna see you
for what you really are.

01:35:06.962 --> 01:35:09.181
Nothing more than a liability.

01:35:10.661 --> 01:35:12.881
And then I'm gonna stitch up
all the loose ends.

01:35:16.885 --> 01:35:18.930
If you think that hiding
the evidence,

01:35:19.235 --> 01:35:21.411
kidnapping my sister,
killing me...

01:35:21.759 --> 01:35:22.934
is gonna trick The Five
into believing

01:35:22.978 --> 01:35:24.719
you're not a fucking wack job.

01:35:26.677 --> 01:35:27.852
You're dreaming, Manson.

01:35:28.026 --> 01:35:29.898
- You fucking sure about that?
- [gun cocks]

01:35:35.033 --> 01:35:40.038
Oh fuck! Ow! Fuck
a monkey's ass! [groaning]

01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:41.866
[laughing, coughing]

01:35:43.825 --> 01:35:46.697
- You all right?
- What are you doing here, man?

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.177
- Waxing off. What do you mean?
- Waxing off.

01:35:48.612 --> 01:35:50.614
Give me some, man.
Give me some.

01:35:50.657 --> 01:35:52.747
This is not the time, man.
You need to put pressure on it--

01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:54.966
I don't wanna kiss you.
I'm not gonna kiss--

01:35:55.401 --> 01:35:57.403
- Hey, where's Manson?
- He's gone.

01:35:57.839 --> 01:35:58.883
[Mike] What?

01:35:58.927 --> 01:35:59.928
- [Ed] He's gone.
- [Mike] Gone where?

01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:01.799
[Ed] He's
fucking outta here, man.

01:36:02.582 --> 01:36:06.021
[Manson] Flick. Flick.
You out here?

01:36:07.283 --> 01:36:09.459
Come on.
We need to get the car and--

01:36:10.112 --> 01:36:14.029
[Flick choking]

01:36:23.386 --> 01:36:25.344
- [metal clanging]
- [Flick chokes]

01:36:33.613 --> 01:36:35.006
[gun cocks]

01:36:37.095 --> 01:36:39.402
- Dude, put two hands on--
- Don't touch it.

01:36:39.445 --> 01:36:40.707
Don't touch it. I'm okay.

01:36:43.232 --> 01:36:45.190
Okay. What do you got?
What the fuck?

01:36:45.843 --> 01:36:47.802
Put that-- What are you going?

01:36:48.367 --> 01:36:50.500
- This is really...
- I'm okay. I'm all right.

01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:52.284
[Sarah screaming]

01:36:52.328 --> 01:36:53.982
- Sarah, shh--
- Go, go, go.

01:36:54.765 --> 01:36:55.766
I love you, man.

01:36:57.333 --> 01:36:59.248
[Manson] You mess my girl up.
It's time to mess you up.

01:36:59.726 --> 01:37:00.815
Shut up!

01:37:00.858 --> 01:37:02.599
- [Sarah sobbing]
- Put your head up here.

01:37:03.426 --> 01:37:04.862
[Mike] Hey, Lurch!

01:37:05.428 --> 01:37:07.560
[Manson] Drop the fucking gun,
quick-draw.

01:37:07.604 --> 01:37:08.474
[Sarah] Mike...

01:37:09.911 --> 01:37:11.651
- Drop the fucking gun!
- All right, all right! Here.

01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:14.611
- Good boy.
- Look,

01:37:14.654 --> 01:37:15.742
The Club can have me, all right?

01:37:17.179 --> 01:37:18.571
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Yeah. I know you will.

01:37:19.268 --> 01:37:21.139
But the Club's got
very specific rules

01:37:21.183 --> 01:37:22.140
about family.

01:37:23.533 --> 01:37:24.664
Did you know that?

01:37:25.752 --> 01:37:27.189
They can never know about us.

01:37:28.973 --> 01:37:30.148
Just let us go man, okay?

01:37:30.192 --> 01:37:31.454
She's got nothing to do
with this.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.282
Get in here and hold
your girl's hand.

01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:34.413
Like if it's between you
and Ed--

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:37.286
- Come in here and kneel down!
- All right. Okay. Please.

01:37:37.503 --> 01:37:39.854
Get in here and kneel down
next to your girl! Now!

01:37:41.594 --> 01:37:43.814
- [Sarah yells]
- [Mike] Sarah!

01:37:44.946 --> 01:37:47.470
[Sarah moans]

01:37:47.818 --> 01:37:49.951
- [gun clicks]
- Damn it!

01:37:50.429 --> 01:37:51.778
Sarah, Sarah. You okay?
Just breathe.

01:37:52.257 --> 01:37:54.216
Keep your palm tight.
Put pressure on it.

01:37:54.738 --> 01:37:58.002
- [Manson groans]
- [Sarah groans]

01:37:58.524 --> 01:38:01.484
[Manson] This'll do. See ya Ed.

01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:10.536
- Mike?
- [Mike] Hmm.

01:38:11.146 --> 01:38:13.061
This hurts way more
than paintball.

01:38:13.104 --> 01:38:14.323
[chuckling]

01:38:14.932 --> 01:38:16.586
Okay. All right.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:17.761
Just hang in there. Just hold.

01:38:21.678 --> 01:38:27.858
[grunting]

01:38:31.427 --> 01:38:33.472
- Do something for me?
- Anything.

01:38:37.041 --> 01:38:39.217
- [Manson] Oh yeah.
- Kill that piece of shit.

01:38:39.478 --> 01:38:40.610
[Manson] Hey Ed!

01:38:42.003 --> 01:38:43.439
Lights out!

01:38:51.664 --> 01:38:53.666
- [Manson] Ed--
- [Mike] Mind if I butt in?

01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:58.802
All right. Let's dance.

01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:05.504
How's the girl?

01:39:16.428 --> 01:39:18.387
Where's my goddamn gun?

01:39:23.305 --> 01:39:24.741
[Manson] Ah, there you are.

01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:30.051
All right, then.
Let's do this, big boy.

01:39:34.751 --> 01:39:36.405
Goddamn that hurts!

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:49.984
[Manson] Come on, Mikey.

01:39:51.115 --> 01:39:52.334
Enough with the running.

01:40:02.344 --> 01:40:03.345
Mikey.

01:40:04.607 --> 01:40:06.087
You shot me in the hand.
That pissed me off.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.011
I see you through there,
Mikey.

01:40:21.711 --> 01:40:22.973
Let's go you little shit.

01:40:26.542 --> 01:40:28.022
Mikey.

01:40:32.939 --> 01:40:34.463
Hey-hey, Mikey.

01:40:35.812 --> 01:40:37.901
You're making me
reload on you, man.

01:40:38.989 --> 01:40:42.123
That's okay.
Doesn't change how this ends.

01:40:42.166 --> 01:40:43.254
[gun cocks]

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:45.343
It's a shame, though.

01:40:46.214 --> 01:40:47.650
You had some real potential.

01:40:48.868 --> 01:40:49.869
Yeah.

01:40:51.784 --> 01:40:54.396
You should understand
that none of this is personal.

01:40:55.571 --> 01:40:58.052
You and I could've made
a pretty good team, buddy.

01:41:02.534 --> 01:41:04.058
Where are you, you little turd?

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.411
- There you are.
- [grenade pin clicks]

01:41:09.454 --> 01:41:11.152
There you are.
Come on. Out you come.

01:41:12.849 --> 01:41:13.850
Huh?

01:41:24.295 --> 01:41:29.039
[Ed coughing]

01:41:29.387 --> 01:41:31.389
Ed? Hey. You all right?

01:41:32.173 --> 01:41:34.479
- Yeah? What were you doing, man?
- Yeah.

01:41:37.003 --> 01:41:38.396
[man applauds]

01:41:41.443 --> 01:41:43.488
Looks like you were wrong
about this one, Eddie.

01:41:44.968 --> 01:41:46.535
[Boss] He'll do just fine.

01:41:49.015 --> 01:41:50.756
Welcome to the Hunters' Club.

01:41:56.588 --> 01:41:57.894
[guns cock]

01:41:58.199 --> 01:42:01.202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay. She's with me.

01:42:01.245 --> 01:42:04.640
All right? She's not a threat
She's, um, she's just...

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.995
This. Not over.

01:42:18.828 --> 01:42:20.177
Let me explain...
