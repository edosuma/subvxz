00:06.485 --> 00:09.445
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:15.205 --> 00:16.405
[in Sinti] [Adelaide...]

00:17.325 --> 00:18.645
[Send everyone away.]

00:31.245 --> 00:32.405
[Alberto...]

00:37.805 --> 00:39.165
[Come here.]

00:49.045 --> 00:52.165
[Even though you're young,
I want you to know the truth.]

00:54.165 --> 00:55.245
[Look at me.]

00:56.005 --> 00:57.085
[Look at me.]

00:59.445 --> 01:02.165
[You have to learn
to look death in the face.]

01:02.725 --> 01:05.725
[You have to be stronger than it.]

01:06.645 --> 01:08.045
[I'm going now.]

01:08.925 --> 01:13.005
[Manfredi will be head of the family,
but he won't make it on his own.]

01:13.645 --> 01:16.365
[You have to be his ally
and always help him.]

01:18.045 --> 01:19.045
[Dad.]

01:20.805 --> 01:22.445
[Manfredi...]

01:22.525 --> 01:24.325
[He doesn't need my advice.]

01:25.405 --> 01:26.845
[Manfredi is a bull.]

01:28.325 --> 01:30.725
[Even bulls lose bullfights.]

01:33.485 --> 01:35.685
[You have to prepare yourself.]

01:36.245 --> 01:38.365
[One day it will be your turn
to be the boss.]

01:40.125 --> 01:41.645
[When your time comes,

01:42.405 --> 01:44.285
you'll understand on your own.]

01:45.565 --> 01:46.685
[And you'll...]

01:48.405 --> 01:50.445
[You'll have to be ready.]

03:43.085 --> 03:46.125
MEDAL OF HONOR

03:57.325 --> 04:00.765
Next time, leave me the keys.
Come on, you're coming with me.

04:01.605 --> 04:02.885
And put that knife down.

04:06.365 --> 04:07.485
Move!

04:08.205 --> 04:09.885
Samurai's waiting for you.

04:24.725 --> 04:26.605
Tell me. What's going on?

04:27.565 --> 04:29.565
The police raided Ostia last night.

04:30.925 --> 04:32.645
-They put a stop to everything.
-I know.

04:32.725 --> 04:34.685
There were some casualties,
weren't there?

04:34.765 --> 04:36.565
They made a lot of arrests.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.805
That'll help the Left a lot.

04:39.885 --> 04:42.685
-What do the polls say?
-It's neck and neck.

04:44.405 --> 04:47.445
Barzacci doesn't want
to hear about Ostia anymore.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.685
He says we have to scare ordinary people,

04:50.765 --> 04:52.445
the average voter.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.165
Hit places seen as safe.

04:55.885 --> 04:58.485
Then we need something
that'll make a lot of noise.

05:00.205 --> 05:01.845
And we need it in a hurry.

05:09.325 --> 05:11.645
So, tell me,
what are you thinking of doing now?

05:14.325 --> 05:17.245
What's good for the family.
That's all you need to know.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.165
But if you'd listened to us,
this whole mess never would've happened.

05:23.685 --> 05:25.885
Now I want to see
if the family still listens to you.

05:30.165 --> 05:31.645
[in Sinti] [This is my house.]

05:32.445 --> 05:36.005
[Everything that's here,
including you, is under my command.]

05:37.125 --> 05:39.005
[It's time you accepted that.]

05:43.165 --> 05:45.045
Sooner or later, things change.

05:56.525 --> 05:58.245
[Get everyone together.]

06:57.965 --> 06:58.965
What did you do?

07:03.765 --> 07:05.245
What's happened, Spadino?

07:06.125 --> 07:07.925
Lele killed a cop yesterday.

07:09.085 --> 07:10.645
The one who interrogated you.

07:14.005 --> 07:15.565
He drowned her in the sea.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.005
I swear, I've never seen him
like that before.

07:21.045 --> 07:22.885
He had this strange look in his eye.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.245
Like a madman.

07:28.685 --> 07:31.125
Before she was killed, she said something.

07:39.285 --> 07:40.445
Go on, Spadino.

07:43.965 --> 07:46.285
She said it was Lele
who killed your father.

08:08.805 --> 08:10.805
What are we going to do?
Go and get him?

08:20.485 --> 08:21.565
No.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.485
No. I don't dirty my hands
with shit like this.

08:29.045 --> 08:30.925
Anyway, he killed my father.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.565
And I killed his.

08:38.845 --> 08:40.845
Nobody comes out of this clean, Spadino.

08:45.485 --> 08:47.245
We've got more important things to do.

09:18.205 --> 09:19.765
Let's go. They're waiting for us.

10:04.525 --> 10:06.085
Let's go. We're here.

10:14.565 --> 10:16.485
I thought
you'd have more pressing concerns.

10:17.645 --> 10:20.085
Getting my hands dirty helps me to think.

10:20.165 --> 10:21.965
Cinaglia's up our ass.
We've got to move now.

10:22.045 --> 10:25.685
The arrests weren't enough. The result
of the election is still uncertain.

10:27.405 --> 10:28.765
I'm thinking it over.

10:30.165 --> 10:32.085
So, tell me what you have in mind.

10:34.565 --> 10:37.605
Listen, to make a plan
you need the right information

10:37.685 --> 10:40.845
and without what I told you about Cinaglia
I don't know what you'd have done.

10:40.925 --> 10:43.285
I'm grateful for the information

10:43.365 --> 10:45.605
but this time it's best
if I deal with it myself.

10:47.165 --> 10:49.045
I don't want to get you in trouble.

10:50.125 --> 10:51.165
What?

10:51.725 --> 10:54.045
You had me pulling holdups
at 15 years of age,

10:54.125 --> 10:56.085
but now I can't sort out some politician.

10:57.085 --> 10:59.965
And the idea that you want to protect me
like a son sounds like bullshit.

11:02.045 --> 11:05.085
If I'm going to get my hands dirty,
I'll do it for you, not for him.

11:12.245 --> 11:16.965
[in Sinti] [If the cops hadn't shown up
we could have easily taken Ostia.]

11:17.605 --> 11:18.885
[That's not true!]

11:18.965 --> 11:22.725
-[A lot of our people are in jail.]
-[Who knows when they'll let them out.]

11:22.805 --> 11:23.805
You're right.

11:23.885 --> 11:27.525
For those who were arrested,
our lawyers are doing their job.

11:27.605 --> 11:29.045
They'll soon be out.

11:30.085 --> 11:32.565
But we frightened everyone.

11:32.645 --> 11:36.565
And we took down
the guy who mattered most.

11:36.885 --> 11:40.085
When Manfredi wakes up, he'll back me up.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.205
Until things die down

11:44.725 --> 11:46.925
we'll only deal on our turf.

11:47.005 --> 11:49.885
We've got plenty of stuff.

11:49.965 --> 11:51.165
[Go.]

11:57.765 --> 11:58.965
[There's not a gram left.]

12:00.125 --> 12:01.245
[Sale took it all.]

12:01.725 --> 12:03.445
[Where's my son and Angelica?]

12:18.365 --> 12:19.365
Where's Lele?

12:19.445 --> 12:20.765
-He's not here.
-Why not?

12:20.845 --> 12:22.885
We don't want him anymore.
Is that a problem?

12:22.965 --> 12:24.245
Yes, it is.

12:24.325 --> 12:25.965
Gabriele's a cop.

12:26.525 --> 12:28.725
How do we know he wasn't behind the raid?

12:28.805 --> 12:30.725
Cinaglia, I lost a man yesterday.

12:32.685 --> 12:37.485
So, forget about Lele. Cut the bullshit
and say what you've got to say.

12:39.005 --> 12:41.205
What we did yesterday wasn't enough.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.685
Now we need something bigger.

12:44.245 --> 12:47.365
-We have to scare the middle class.
-Something everyone will talk about.

12:47.445 --> 12:50.925
You want to go into business in Rome?
Then, that's what you have to do.

12:51.005 --> 12:53.765
You're getting a taste for it, huh?
Do you feel like one of us?

12:53.845 --> 12:55.045
No.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.925
I'm not getting a taste for it.
I'm risking my life.

12:58.005 --> 13:00.245
Ah, and what do you want us to do?

13:00.325 --> 13:02.005
A robbery? Fuck somebody up?

13:02.325 --> 13:03.365
More.

13:04.045 --> 13:06.765
Something that will be all over the papers
the next day.

13:09.965 --> 13:11.685
You want to kill someone.

13:15.165 --> 13:17.245
Someone random, or will you tell us who?

13:21.565 --> 13:22.765
I have an idea.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.405
-Have you seen Marchilli?
-He hasn't come in yet.

13:45.645 --> 13:47.525
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

13:47.605 --> 13:50.365
Maybe he's in Ostia Levante.
Have you heard what happened?

13:52.325 --> 13:54.965
Last night, they killed
Deputy Inspector Mara Guagli.

13:55.045 --> 13:56.405
They drowned her.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.605
Gabriele, you know
how this is going to end, right?

14:08.085 --> 14:09.925
The more you resist,
the more I'll hurt you.

14:20.285 --> 14:22.405
Why'd you have to get mixed up
with that politician?

14:23.085 --> 14:24.805
I gave you what you needed.

14:29.085 --> 14:33.085
Come on, tell me what you're up to
with Cinaglia and the other two assholes.

14:33.165 --> 14:34.325
What are you plotting?

14:57.925 --> 14:58.765
Well?

14:59.365 --> 15:00.685
I don't know anything.

15:02.125 --> 15:04.325
And if I did know something,
I wouldn't tell you.

15:06.525 --> 15:08.485
You've been ruining my life
for three months.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.845
Kill me if you want to.

15:19.565 --> 15:20.845
As you wish.

15:27.765 --> 15:29.925
I'd like to thank someone

15:30.005 --> 15:32.485
without whom none of this would exist.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.485
It's thanks to her
that work begins tomorrow

15:35.565 --> 15:37.565
and that this structure will become

15:37.645 --> 15:40.965
the biggest refugee reception facility
in the capital.

15:41.045 --> 15:44.885
Countess Della Rocca Croce,
the President of our Association.

15:49.045 --> 15:52.125
I'd like to thank our mayoral candidates,

15:52.205 --> 15:54.925
Cardinal Nascari,
and the members of the press gathered here

15:55.005 --> 15:57.205
for supporting this important cause.

15:58.605 --> 16:00.445
All I can say

16:01.245 --> 16:03.125
is that it broke my heart

16:03.925 --> 16:07.725
when I heard that so many mothers,
fathers, children,

16:07.805 --> 16:12.285
after being forced to live in a tent city,
were separated from one another...

16:14.125 --> 16:15.285
She's an old lady.

16:17.525 --> 16:21.285
Who would've expected that from Monaschi?
But at least she's a woman of the church.

16:21.365 --> 16:23.045
Our Association has created a place

16:23.125 --> 16:25.765
where all these people
will be able to stay together

16:25.845 --> 16:28.085
and will not have to give up a right

16:28.165 --> 16:30.845
that is sacrosanct for everyone:

16:31.805 --> 16:32.805
family.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.925
This is the lady I've heard so much about.

16:42.565 --> 16:45.085
Alice has been a great help
with the electoral campaign.

16:45.765 --> 16:47.725
Without her,
I don't know if I'd have made it.

16:47.805 --> 16:51.285
Good, good.
A wife should always help her husband.

16:51.365 --> 16:54.685
I hope you'll be at the Holy Mass
this evening.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.325
Of course, Your Eminence.

17:02.765 --> 17:05.445
Well? What do you say?

17:05.525 --> 17:09.965
-If it has to be done, it'll be done.
-Fine, but let's get it done quickly.

17:10.045 --> 17:12.405
-I have some unfinished business with her.
-Okay.

17:18.485 --> 17:21.805
Your Eminence,
thank you for the support you've given us.

17:21.885 --> 17:23.885
But the moment has come to join forces.

17:23.965 --> 17:25.885
We want the same thing:

17:25.965 --> 17:27.725
to eliminate corruption.

17:28.205 --> 17:30.005
You from the Holy See, me from Rome.

17:30.084 --> 17:32.205
In both cases, we're talking about a man

17:32.285 --> 17:34.885
with whom we've both had
to do business in the past.

17:34.965 --> 17:35.965
Samurai.

17:37.565 --> 17:41.485
I need you, Your Eminence, to stop him.

17:42.685 --> 17:44.845
Countess, if I'm not mistaken

17:44.925 --> 17:47.525
this structure belongs to Samurai.

17:47.605 --> 17:51.005
It's thanks to him that you've been able
to take in hundreds of refugees.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.725
And that you became
the head of the Congregation of Bishops

17:54.805 --> 17:58.205
immediately after you cleared
his land in Ostia.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.725
You put the refugees there on purpose.

18:00.805 --> 18:03.725
First you created a problem,
then you resolved it for him.

18:03.805 --> 18:06.205
And you knew exactly
what to ask in exchange.

18:06.965 --> 18:08.605
A compromise

18:08.685 --> 18:10.445
for the greater good.

18:11.085 --> 18:13.125
But I no longer have
anything to do with him.

18:13.765 --> 18:15.965
That's where you're mistaken.

18:17.205 --> 18:19.965
Tell me what you want exactly.

18:20.045 --> 18:22.685
I want an ally to stop him.

18:23.405 --> 18:26.485
For the good of the Church, and of Rome.

18:29.285 --> 18:32.885
I have a meeting
with the Congregation now.

18:33.805 --> 18:36.125
We'll find another opportunity
to discuss this.

18:37.085 --> 18:39.085
Tonight, after Mass.

18:44.085 --> 18:46.085
DEPUTY INSPECTOR G. MARCHILLI

19:20.765 --> 19:22.005
Well?

19:22.365 --> 19:24.605
-Will you talk now?
-No.

19:51.005 --> 19:53.365
Hey! Wake up!

19:55.885 --> 19:57.125
He's alive. He's alive.

20:03.525 --> 20:05.605
He'll die without saying a word.

20:14.365 --> 20:16.525
Of all of the days
he had to play the hero today.

20:16.605 --> 20:18.485
This piece of shit.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.525
We'll use him to make someone else talk.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.325
It's all set. The guys are getting ready.

20:31.965 --> 20:32.965
Good.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.285
What's wrong?

20:40.645 --> 20:44.205
-I didn't think I'd go this far.
-I know.

20:44.925 --> 20:46.445
I didn't think so either.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.765
But here we are.

20:55.485 --> 20:57.245
I didn't think you were like this.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.325
Like what?

20:59.405 --> 21:01.165
Willing to do anything.

21:02.045 --> 21:03.325
Do I scare you?

21:04.445 --> 21:05.605
No.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.885
-Yes?
-I want to see you. Now.

21:14.965 --> 21:16.125
I'm not interested.

21:16.205 --> 21:19.765
You don't get it. Either you come here,
or I'll come get you at home.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.845
And if you're not there,
I'll take your family.

21:21.925 --> 21:23.245
Is that clear?

21:27.405 --> 21:29.005
-Who was it?
-Samurai.

21:29.485 --> 21:31.005
He threatened my family.

21:32.445 --> 21:34.645
-I have to go. Excuse me.
-I'm coming with you.

22:06.845 --> 22:08.085
All good?

22:08.685 --> 22:09.765
Doesn't it show?

22:24.405 --> 22:26.565
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

22:34.605 --> 22:36.325
How can you look me in the face?

22:39.045 --> 22:40.365
What are you talking about?

22:42.005 --> 22:43.525
You know what I mean.

22:49.485 --> 22:51.965
I killed your father.
How can you stand to be near me?

22:58.885 --> 23:00.645
You're right, I should have killed you.

23:02.285 --> 23:04.085
But then I started using my head.

23:07.005 --> 23:09.005
Nothing was going to bring my father back.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.325
And why didn't you kill Lele?

23:28.405 --> 23:29.485
Like you said.

23:31.165 --> 23:33.245
Nothing is going to bring my father back.

23:44.845 --> 23:45.925
I'm hungry.

23:48.525 --> 23:49.805
Have you got some time?

23:51.445 --> 23:54.445
Not much.
But I've got some, yes.

24:27.005 --> 24:27.885
Hi, darling.

24:27.965 --> 24:29.645
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

24:34.525 --> 24:35.525
Amedeo...

24:36.925 --> 24:38.005
What is it?

24:44.125 --> 24:45.365
What's going on?

24:46.125 --> 24:48.565
I want you to take the kids
and go to a hotel.

24:49.965 --> 24:53.445
-What are you talking about?
-Go to a hotel. And take the babysitter.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.085
-Why a hotel?
-Just because.

24:55.165 --> 24:57.765
-I'll join you later.
-Tonight is Cardinal Nascari's Mass.

24:57.845 --> 25:00.325
-We have to be there.
-Alice, I'm not joking around.

25:00.885 --> 25:02.725
Tell me what the fuck is going on, Amedeo!

25:02.805 --> 25:05.045
Nothing will fucking happen
if you do what I say!

25:05.125 --> 25:06.925
Take the children and go to a hotel.

25:07.805 --> 25:09.645
And forget about the Mass.

25:42.245 --> 25:43.525
Believe me, Vincenzo,

25:43.605 --> 25:46.925
I'm not at all happy
about how things have turned out.

25:47.005 --> 25:48.285
And I'm not happy.

25:48.365 --> 25:51.765
-With how you managed my money.
-Suddenly we're enemies?

25:54.045 --> 25:55.205
Would you like to come in?

25:58.525 --> 25:59.525
Yes.

26:00.285 --> 26:03.485
But as an ally
who deserves an explanation.

26:15.805 --> 26:16.805
Are they okay?

26:17.485 --> 26:18.885
Yes.

26:21.005 --> 26:22.525
I have to go see Samurai.

26:25.245 --> 26:26.285
Then go armed.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.125
Be careful.

26:53.045 --> 26:56.165
-You're ruining everything.
-You already did that.

26:56.245 --> 26:57.765
With all your fuck-ups.

26:58.565 --> 27:01.445
Remember, it's thanks to me
that Angelica became an Anacleti.

27:02.005 --> 27:05.205
Maybe, but so far I've put up
all the money for everyone else.

27:05.765 --> 27:09.885
I respect you, Adelaide.
But you have to accept a new heir.

27:09.965 --> 27:11.125
My husband.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.485
He's also your son, in case you forgot.

27:16.605 --> 27:20.245
I gave the coke to Spadino.
He and Angelica are the future.

27:21.285 --> 27:22.805
Let's take a step back

27:23.965 --> 27:25.685
and make space for them.

27:37.325 --> 27:40.205
Ladies and gentlemen,
the King of the Gypsies!

27:46.845 --> 27:47.845
Spadino.

27:49.045 --> 27:52.045
-Hey, do you want some pasta?
-No, thanks.

27:59.685 --> 28:00.685
Cinaglia?

28:01.965 --> 28:02.965
What do you need?

28:05.925 --> 28:08.165
No, I'll take care of it.

28:09.245 --> 28:10.245
Bye.

28:11.925 --> 28:14.085
-What does he want?
-He asked me for a gun.

28:14.805 --> 28:15.965
Cinaglia asked for a gun!

28:16.045 --> 28:18.045
-What the fuck's he need it for?
-What do I know?

28:20.325 --> 28:22.085
Aureliano, I need to talk to you.

28:28.885 --> 28:30.365
I get it, Spadino, I'll go.

28:33.085 --> 28:35.205
-He's all yours.
-Turn the music off.

28:41.645 --> 28:43.965
I took all my family's shit.

28:45.645 --> 28:47.605
Now they'll do what I say.

28:49.645 --> 28:50.765
And if you like

28:51.765 --> 28:53.885
we can deal it in Ostia with your men.

28:55.565 --> 28:58.205
What do you say?
Do you want to be partners?

29:05.165 --> 29:07.005
Finally some good news.

29:08.805 --> 29:10.285
We'll go 50-50.

29:11.405 --> 29:14.085
-Actually, you ought to pay me.
-With what?

29:15.285 --> 29:18.245
Fair enough. You're a friend: 80-20.

29:18.325 --> 29:20.285
-We can negotiate later.
-All right.

29:24.925 --> 29:26.605
You managed to do it in the end.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.205
Boss of the Gypsies.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.525
So it would seem.

29:37.765 --> 29:40.725
Have some pasta, we have to celebrate.
Nadia, come here.

29:42.925 --> 29:44.085
Then you can go home.

29:45.205 --> 29:46.885
I'll take care of the Countess.

29:50.245 --> 29:51.245
Come here.

29:52.085 --> 29:53.125
To us!

29:53.205 --> 29:54.485
Enjoy!

30:22.205 --> 30:23.325
Lele?

30:28.285 --> 30:29.285
Who's that?

30:32.565 --> 30:34.165
Cinaglia's cop.

30:36.285 --> 30:37.485
Ah, so that's him.

30:38.325 --> 30:40.045
That's why I didn't want
to get you involved.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.125
So why have you changed your mind now?

30:42.205 --> 30:43.925
I thought about what you said to me.

30:45.085 --> 30:46.885
You were never a kid
that needed protecting.

30:47.445 --> 30:49.645
You were always an ally.

30:52.645 --> 30:54.165
You remember this, don't you?

30:58.605 --> 31:00.565
It's time to get your hands dirty again.

31:09.645 --> 31:11.725
We've got a visitor. Come with me.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.685
See your poor little friend?

32:51.845 --> 32:53.485
Take it as a warning, Amedeo.

32:55.485 --> 32:57.485
You can still avoid meeting the same fate.

32:59.485 --> 33:01.165
Do you know what your mistake is?

33:03.085 --> 33:04.725
You're too trusting.

33:06.765 --> 33:09.845
A politician ought to know
that Rome is a small place.

33:10.925 --> 33:12.885
Alliances are fragile.

33:12.965 --> 33:16.685
First some guy helps you,
gives you a megaphone to get votes.

33:16.765 --> 33:20.565
Then he sells you out,
and tells others what you're up to.

33:20.645 --> 33:23.205
You present yourself
as the upstanding citizen

33:23.285 --> 33:25.365
but you're the biggest scumbag of all.

33:29.565 --> 33:30.645
What do you want?

33:53.125 --> 33:55.285
What are you doing here, Sara? It's late.

33:56.685 --> 33:59.685
And so, another day of glory for you.

34:00.325 --> 34:01.765
My sincerest compliments.

34:03.205 --> 34:05.485
You're aging well, Countess.

34:08.285 --> 34:09.565
But you're aging.

34:11.205 --> 34:14.845
Hurry up
or you'll be late for the Mass tonight.

34:17.365 --> 34:18.365
Goodbye, Sara.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.525
We had a straightforward deal.

34:32.525 --> 34:34.045
I gave you a chance

34:34.125 --> 34:35.765
but you backed out.

34:36.525 --> 34:37.845
You were too ambitious.

34:37.925 --> 34:40.965
I'm giving you the chance
to make a dignified exit.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.164
Go on the radio with him

34:42.244 --> 34:44.565
and announce live on air
that you're leaving politics.

34:44.644 --> 34:47.605
Make up anything you like
but get the fuck out of the way.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.125
No.

34:56.605 --> 34:58.445
Where the fuck are you going, Cinaglia?

35:00.164 --> 35:02.165
Look, I wasn't asking you.

35:05.005 --> 35:06.485
What the fuck are you--

35:11.005 --> 35:14.205
Don't move! Don't move!
Piece of shit! Throw down the gun!

35:14.285 --> 35:15.445
Throw it down!

35:36.725 --> 35:37.765
Fuck!

35:41.485 --> 35:43.125
In the darkest moments

35:43.765 --> 35:47.285
we must retrace the path of the Lord

35:47.365 --> 35:49.365
to return to the light.

35:49.885 --> 35:52.685
Tonight we are doing that together

35:53.245 --> 35:54.925
in a place like this

35:55.765 --> 35:58.245
on a dark night like this...

36:18.605 --> 36:21.205
Peter left the walls of Rome.

36:21.285 --> 36:24.125
He was fleeing Nero's persecution.

36:24.925 --> 36:26.725
When he was at the gate

36:26.805 --> 36:29.165
he saw Christ walking towards him.

36:29.725 --> 36:31.325
He was entering the city.

36:32.725 --> 36:34.325
So Peter asked him,

36:34.405 --> 36:36.725
"Lord, where are you going?"

36:37.765 --> 36:39.165
Christ replied,

36:40.005 --> 36:41.405
"I have come

36:41.485 --> 36:44.685
to be crucified a second time."

36:47.445 --> 36:51.205
Peter understood
that Christ had to be crucified again.

36:51.285 --> 36:54.845
Not as Christ himself, however,
but rather in the form of his servant.

36:54.925 --> 36:57.525
And that servant was him.

36:59.165 --> 37:00.925
Shut up! Shut up!

37:08.605 --> 37:10.085
It didn't matter

37:10.165 --> 37:13.525
that the faithful had begged him to flee,
to seek refuge.

37:14.085 --> 37:15.125
Peter...

37:15.645 --> 37:17.645
went to meet his death.

37:37.565 --> 37:39.725
And he died crucified

37:39.805 --> 37:42.525
praising the Lord Jesus Christ.

38:03.485 --> 38:05.125
Praised be Jesus Christ.

38:05.685 --> 38:07.485
Forever and ever.

38:09.725 --> 38:10.725
Come here.

38:11.685 --> 38:12.765
Come here.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.565
There's only one thing you have to do:

38:20.725 --> 38:22.605
enjoy your husband's victory.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.685
And mind your own fucking business.

38:44.725 --> 38:45.725
Well?

38:47.325 --> 38:50.725
-Did they listen to you straight away?
-They came looking for me.

38:50.805 --> 38:52.805
They all want to know
what you have to say.

39:25.805 --> 39:27.605
[in Sinti] [The drugs are somewhere safe.]

39:28.285 --> 39:29.565
[I've got them.]

39:30.605 --> 39:31.525
[I hid them.]

39:32.285 --> 39:34.685
[I didn't agree to going to war in Ostia.]

39:34.765 --> 39:36.605
[It wasn't the right strategy.]

39:39.165 --> 39:42.285
It's time for this family
to start using its head and not its hands.

39:42.365 --> 39:44.005
It's time to start negotiating.

39:44.085 --> 39:47.405
Not to shoot, but to negotiate with those
who are really in charge of this city.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.485
On our terms.

39:51.285 --> 39:54.525
I've already started.
Actually, I've got some good news.

39:54.605 --> 39:55.845
Within a few days

39:55.925 --> 39:59.165
my father-in-law and all of us
will get the money back that we put in.

40:02.365 --> 40:05.925
I've made an agreement to deal in Ostia
without bloodshed and above all

40:06.005 --> 40:07.685
without fear of raids.

40:08.485 --> 40:10.725
It'll be a gradual thing,
but it'll be safe.

40:10.805 --> 40:13.085
[Bravo, Spadino, you did good!]

40:13.165 --> 40:14.565
[Bravo, Spadino!]

40:14.645 --> 40:17.085
[Bravo! Enough taking risks!]

40:17.645 --> 40:18.885
[We'll use our brains.]

40:18.965 --> 40:20.045
That's right.

40:20.525 --> 40:23.045
Our family has never taken
this step before.

40:24.085 --> 40:25.965
Not even when my brother was in charge.

40:29.005 --> 40:30.605
And I want to thank my mother

40:31.485 --> 40:33.205
who did everything she could.

40:36.405 --> 40:39.605
But now,
it's time for me to take Manfredi's place.

40:39.685 --> 40:43.845
Because this family has to be run by a man
who gets things done!

41:04.405 --> 41:06.725
I know you warned Adami.

41:07.285 --> 41:08.765
They were ready.

41:12.565 --> 41:14.125
Even if that were the case...

41:17.125 --> 41:19.565
there's nothing
you can do about it anymore.

41:24.645 --> 41:26.605
[Let's take everything!]

41:43.965 --> 41:45.085
Well?

41:45.165 --> 41:46.645
I'm working for you too.

41:46.725 --> 41:49.805
-I can't stand being rushed.
-I can't stand it when debts aren't paid.

41:49.885 --> 41:53.645
Nascari didn't make any declaration,
and Cinaglia hasn't withdrawn.

41:53.725 --> 41:55.245
I told you I'll take care of it.

41:55.325 --> 41:57.805
Why haven't you done it yet?
The election is tomorrow.

41:58.685 --> 42:01.045
There's a big difference
between you in your offices

42:01.125 --> 42:02.445
and me down on the street.

42:02.525 --> 42:05.125
What are you saying?
You're the most feared man in this town.

42:05.205 --> 42:07.085
And you can't stop
one small-time politician?

42:07.165 --> 42:09.525
He can't be that small-time
if you want him out, can he?

42:09.605 --> 42:11.085
Deal are deals.

42:11.165 --> 42:13.525
I asked you for one thing,
and you don't give it to me.

42:13.605 --> 42:15.605
How and why this is happening
doesn't interest me.

42:18.605 --> 42:20.125
You should put that out.

42:26.365 --> 42:27.605
I'm done with you.

42:35.725 --> 42:37.885
You should have taken him to the hospital.

42:39.805 --> 42:41.125
I told him, Sara.

42:41.645 --> 42:42.845
He didn't want to go.

42:45.285 --> 42:49.565
Anyway, you can't stay here.
Do you want to come to my place?

43:02.365 --> 43:03.685
It's done.

43:05.645 --> 43:06.645
She's dead.

43:15.685 --> 43:17.205
But there was a problem.

43:19.605 --> 43:21.045
It involves Alice.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.725
Alice?

43:26.365 --> 43:27.605
Do you think she'll talk?

43:29.805 --> 43:30.925
I don't know.

43:31.005 --> 43:33.845
But it's something
we've got to sort out with Cinaglia.

44:05.885 --> 44:07.205
We need to talk.

44:09.205 --> 44:10.405
I want to confess.

44:13.125 --> 44:15.565
