WEBVTT

00:03.864 --> 00:06.645
* We're gonna fly to screw
each morning *

00:06.765 --> 00:09.732
* we're gonna smile
the entire time *

00:09.852 --> 00:13.020
* we're gonna be more happy *

00:13.055 --> 00:15.156
* we're gonna finally be fine *

00:15.190 --> 00:18.176
* we're gonna get more calm
and normal *

00:18.178 --> 00:21.245
* we're gonna fix
our state of mind *

00:21.280 --> 00:23.614
* we're gonna be less crazy *

00:23.665 --> 00:26.834
* we're gonna finally
be fine *

00:26.869 --> 00:29.704
* we're gonna stand holding
hands in a brand new land *

00:29.738 --> 00:32.406
* far away
from the borderline *

00:32.424 --> 00:35.626
* we're gonna seem like
a mainstream dream *

00:35.677 --> 00:39.764
* and be appealing
to all mankind *

00:39.798 --> 00:42.350
* we're gonna have more fun
and be less weird *

00:42.384 --> 00:45.586
* than the first two years
combined *

00:45.604 --> 00:48.222
* and we're gonna
live forever *

00:48.257 --> 00:50.975
* and we're gonna sleep
together *

00:51.026 --> 00:54.195
* and we're gonna finally
be sunny and shinily *

00:54.229 --> 00:57.431
* we're gonna finally be fine *

00:57.449 --> 01:00.501
Jeff. Jeff?

01:00.536 --> 01:02.291
Oh, sorry.
Uh, what was the question?

01:02.411 --> 01:03.895
What are we gonna do
without Pierce

01:03.930 --> 01:05.163
in the study group this year?

01:05.197 --> 01:07.466
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.399
Speaking of figuring
things out,

01:09.761 --> 01:12.737
me and Abed
have an announcement.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.474
Troy and I are living together.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.742
- Oh, that's...
- Oh, that's nice.

01:17.777 --> 01:18.944
If you want to get us a gift,

01:18.978 --> 01:20.312
we're registered
at linens 'n things.

01:20.346 --> 01:21.780
We have plenty of linens.
We mainly want the things.

01:21.814 --> 01:23.882
How you like me now, bitches?

01:23.916 --> 01:25.317
Dean, you seem different.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.685
Are you in a play right now?

01:26.719 --> 01:27.853
Over the summer,
I decided it's time

01:27.887 --> 01:29.688
to whip this place into shape.

01:29.722 --> 01:32.757
I'm gonna be a mean, lean,
deaning machine.

01:32.775 --> 01:34.926
No more paintball,
no more spaceships,

01:34.944 --> 01:36.962
no more trampolines,
and no more...

01:36.996 --> 01:39.030
What is that?

01:39.065 --> 01:41.633
It's probably the monkey
that lives in the vents.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.369
I named him "Annie's boobs,"
after Annie's boobs.

01:44.403 --> 01:46.771
See, this is the kind of
national lampoonery

01:46.789 --> 01:48.990
that is coming
to an end this year.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.142
Homie don't dean this.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.444
Okay, guys,
let's get to biology on time.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.612
I don't want to be
a screwup this year.

01:54.630 --> 01:56.281
Uh, Britta.

01:56.315 --> 01:58.283
Damn it.

01:58.317 --> 02:00.018
We're really doing this
without Pierce?

02:00.052 --> 02:01.553
So sad.

02:01.587 --> 02:03.889
Yeah, we have parted ways
with our closest,

02:03.923 --> 02:06.457
oldest, craziest,
most racist, oldest,

02:06.475 --> 02:09.394
elderly, crazy friend,
and he's not coming back.

02:09.428 --> 02:10.461
I'm back.

02:12.598 --> 02:13.798
How was your summer?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.934
Enlightful, Annie.

02:15.968 --> 02:19.137
I underwent three months
of intensive soul-rezoning

02:19.155 --> 02:21.489
at the laser lotus
celebrity center.

02:21.524 --> 02:25.577
I stand before you a more
highly evolved Pierce Hawthorne,

02:25.611 --> 02:30.081
one that can accept
that this table has a...

02:30.116 --> 02:31.249
has a sort of magic in it.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.484
Aww.

02:32.518 --> 02:34.152
And I'd like to come back.

02:34.170 --> 02:36.888
- Yeah.
- Damn it!

02:36.923 --> 02:38.924
Oh, uh, sorry.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.625
I just had
the frustrating realization

02:40.660 --> 02:42.660
that you can't come back
to the group,

02:42.678 --> 02:44.495
because you're not in biology
and it's all filled up.

02:44.513 --> 02:45.830
Well, couldn't we take
something else?

02:45.865 --> 02:48.016
I mean, surely we've
evolved beyond

02:48.050 --> 02:49.517
caring what class
we take together.

02:49.552 --> 02:51.236
- Oh, yeah.
- Pierce!

02:51.270 --> 02:54.723
I'll do you one better.

02:54.774 --> 02:59.044
I think we've evolved beyond
reliance on a group at all.

02:59.078 --> 03:01.780
Aren't we just actual friends
now, no matter where we are?

03:01.814 --> 03:03.515
You know what's magic
about this table?

03:03.549 --> 03:07.085
It magically keeps our books
from falling on the floor.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.122
The table's for studying,
but as friends, we've evolved.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.907
And let's use that first breath

03:12.959 --> 03:15.493
of crisp, new,
super evolved air

03:15.528 --> 03:19.564
to declare proudly
and in one voice, "Pierce...

03:19.599 --> 03:24.135
We'll see you
when we see you."

03:24.981 --> 03:35.278

03:40.119 --> 03:41.942
Don't tell the monkey
I'm living here.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.491
* Give me some rope,
tie me to a tree *

03:46.525 --> 03:49.894
* give me the hope
to run out of steam *

03:49.929 --> 03:53.131
* somebody said
we could be here *

03:53.165 --> 03:57.085
* we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year *

03:57.119 --> 04:02.173
* I can't count the reasons
I should stay *

04:02.208 --> 04:08.213
* one by one they all
just fade away *

04:13.497 --> 04:15.833
Oh, star-burns,
I see you added a lizard

04:15.953 --> 04:18.272
to your special hat
and sideburns.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.305
Am I missing anything?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.464
Yeah! The human being
underneath it all,

04:21.584 --> 04:23.795
but no one's really interested
in that, are they?

04:23.829 --> 04:24.551
No.

04:24.671 --> 04:26.477
I hope we did the right thing
about Pierce.

04:26.597 --> 04:27.932
He really seems
like he's changed.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.067
What are you, nuts?

04:29.101 --> 04:30.268
That's what
he wants you to think.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.337
Trust me, we're better off
without him.

04:32.371 --> 04:34.472
Excluding Pierce is what
drove him crazy last year.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.808
Wrong, being crazy
drove him excluded.

04:38.994 --> 04:40.278
What's wrong?

04:40.312 --> 04:41.779
Cougar town has been moved
to mid-season.

04:41.797 --> 04:43.648
That's never a good sign.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.350
Not cool, not cool, not cool,
not cool, not cool...

04:45.384 --> 04:47.519
Hey buddy, hey,
it's coming back in January.

04:47.553 --> 04:48.586
Six seasons and a movie.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.972
Six seasons and a movie.

04:51.006 --> 04:52.891
Oh.

04:55.094 --> 04:57.095
This is Intro to Biology.

04:57.129 --> 05:01.733
I'm your professor,
Dr. Marshall King, PhD.

05:01.767 --> 05:05.520
It took me 6,205 hours
to get my degree,

05:05.571 --> 05:09.240
and I know, because I was only
allowed in the library

05:09.275 --> 05:12.744
one hour per day at the San
Vicente correctional facility

05:12.778 --> 05:17.832
while serving a sentence
of 25 to life.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.868
Now let's talk about that word.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.419
"Life."

05:21.454 --> 05:23.538
Sorry.

05:23.589 --> 05:27.208
It's a new phone.
Switching to vibrate.

05:27.259 --> 05:30.328
Continue.
This is really great.

05:30.362 --> 05:33.898
I stared at a crack in the
ground in my cell for years,

05:33.933 --> 05:36.167
and one day,
something grew from it.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.603
A single blade of grass.

05:42.274 --> 05:44.743
Vibrates louder than the ringer.

05:44.777 --> 05:48.847
Gosh. You know what?
Turning it off.

05:48.881 --> 05:53.451
Living thing,
growing from dead stone.

05:54.653 --> 05:55.737
Get out!

05:55.788 --> 05:57.372
- Oh, it's off, it's off.
- Out!

05:57.406 --> 05:59.257
I turned it off.

06:00.808 --> 06:02.744
Fine. Okay, fine.
I'm leaving.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.229
And don't bother coming back.

06:04.263 --> 06:05.874
Seriously?
Hey, dude,

06:05.994 --> 06:09.134
Sean Penn called.
He says to dial it back.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.368
Sean Penn is an actor who...

06:10.386 --> 06:12.812
I know who Sean Penn is.
I've seen Milk.

06:12.932 --> 06:15.106
Now get out.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.108
Dude, learn to blend.

06:18.789 --> 06:21.947
I will not tolerate
monkeys living on campus.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.016
If I wanted
to run a monkey hotel,

06:24.050 --> 06:26.318
I'd install a banana buffet.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.187
I'd use vines as elevators,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.122
and I'd put tail holes
in the bathrobes,

06:30.157 --> 06:31.740
and I'd lower all the shower
knobs.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.375
Wow, you've really thought
this through.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.227
And now it's your turn.
Brainstorm.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.295
Idea shower.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.030
Spray your solutions
all over me.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.132
Well, w-we could seal
all the vents

06:40.167 --> 06:42.168
and then pump the ducts
with some kind of gas

06:42.202 --> 06:45.438
that knocks out monkeys.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.223
Monkey knockout gas!

06:47.257 --> 06:49.942
Now that's the kind of grounded,
sensible thinking

06:49.976 --> 06:52.228
I want to see this year.

06:52.262 --> 06:53.446
Catherine, who's next?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.680
Vice Dean Laybourne,

06:54.714 --> 06:56.715
from the air conditioning
repair school annex.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.517
Vice Dean.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.952
Dean.
New suit, Dean?

06:59.986 --> 07:02.755
New Dean, vice Dean.
New Dean.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.924
I see that you
used school funds

07:04.958 --> 07:08.060
to buy an espresso machine
for your faculty break room.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.563
I don't recall
being consulted on that.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.114
I don't consult you
on anything.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.732
That's the problem.

07:13.750 --> 07:17.136
The air-conditioning repair
school annex seems to think.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.904
That it's separate
from Greendale,

07:18.939 --> 07:22.241
but it's an annex.

07:22.259 --> 07:24.577
An appendage, on a body,
with a head,

07:24.611 --> 07:27.847
and this head is saying
to this appendage,

07:27.881 --> 07:30.216
"whazup?"

07:30.250 --> 07:31.584
What you say makes sense, Dean.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.185
Tell you what.

07:33.220 --> 07:38.023
You bring your head down
to my appendage tomorrow,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.792
and I'll show you
"whazup."

07:39.826 --> 07:43.162
I'll be there.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:56.142 --> 07:59.128
I think I found something
that will help Abed!

07:59.162 --> 08:01.280
Abed, did you know
that Cougar Town

08:01.314 --> 08:05.951
is an American adaptation
of a 1990s British sitcom?

08:05.969 --> 08:07.853
Cougarton abbey.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.289
Just been 'round
Cougarton chapel.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.291
I may be having an awakening.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.726
Come off it, Deidre.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.528
You've only been having
a butchers at the choir boys.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.982
Better than nothing.
Thanks, Britta.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.066
Can you believe that guy,

08:21.101 --> 08:23.602
kicking me out of class
like that?

08:23.636 --> 08:25.854
It's gonna be impossible
to find a science class

08:25.906 --> 08:26.989
with six open spots.

08:27.023 --> 08:28.340
Why would we need to do that?

08:28.375 --> 08:29.491
Because I'm not in biology
anymore.

08:29.526 --> 08:31.210
And neither is Pierce,

08:31.244 --> 08:32.778
but you're both
still our friends.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.046
We've evolved.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.181
Right, Jeff?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.089
Yes, we have.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.874
- And we all love each other.
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.795
And we all go
to the same school, so, uh...

08:49.829 --> 08:52.097
I guess I'll see ya
when I see ya.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.185
Hey, guess what.

08:56.219 --> 08:58.270
I was on the wait list
for biology,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.239
somebody got kicked out,
I am...

09:00.273 --> 09:01.506
Here to study!

09:01.524 --> 09:03.236
Yay!

09:11.252 --> 09:13.253
All hail, sir eats alone.

09:13.271 --> 09:14.322
Shut up, Leonard.

09:14.356 --> 09:16.057
I heard about
your prescription socks.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.777
Hope you don't mind, Jeff,

09:19.811 --> 09:20.778
but I've got
a new favorite show,

09:20.812 --> 09:22.029
and I'm only on episode six.

09:22.064 --> 09:24.198
You guys got about
five minutes left to eat.

09:24.232 --> 09:26.617
Oh, my, time flies when you're
studying the science of life.

09:26.652 --> 09:28.152
Well, I think time flies
when you're joking around

09:28.186 --> 09:30.437
about movie titles that sound
like names for poops.

09:30.455 --> 09:32.506
Remains of the day.

09:33.642 --> 09:34.792
Wait a second.

09:34.826 --> 09:37.111
Were you eavesdropping
on our study session?

09:37.129 --> 09:39.446
I was eavesdropping
on your goof-off session,

09:39.464 --> 09:41.215
and you dummies missed
the most obvious one.

09:41.249 --> 09:42.750
No, I said,
"Green Mile."

09:42.784 --> 09:44.284
Operation dumbo drop!

09:44.302 --> 09:46.620
- Ew!
- Gross!

09:46.638 --> 09:48.055
Too clever by half, Jeffrey.

09:48.090 --> 09:50.091
All right, well uh, I gotta go.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.125
Thanks for the five minutes.

09:51.143 --> 09:52.460
Aw, Jeffrey.

09:52.494 --> 09:55.663
Blimey. The barrister's
foreclosed the abbey.

09:55.697 --> 09:58.733
Fancy a drink, then?

09:58.767 --> 10:02.069
Oi, fetch us a hemlock.

10:02.104 --> 10:04.905
Um...

10:12.748 --> 10:14.782
- Um...
- Britta?

10:14.816 --> 10:17.318
Why did everyone
on Cougarton Abbey just die?

10:17.352 --> 10:19.253
They only ran six episodes.

10:19.287 --> 10:21.489
That's the great thing about
British tv.

10:21.523 --> 10:22.656
They give you closure.

10:23.792 --> 10:24.875
No, no, no!

10:24.926 --> 10:26.010
We'll find you
a new favorite show!

10:26.044 --> 10:27.261
We'll find you
a new favorite show!

10:27.295 --> 10:30.965
Come on, buddy.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.333
You are human tennis elbow.

10:32.367 --> 10:35.219
You are a pizza burn on the roof
of the world's mouth.

10:35.270 --> 10:38.239
You are the opposite of Batman.

10:43.779 --> 10:45.079
You don't need them, man.

10:45.113 --> 10:47.615
Exactly.
I'll see 'em when I see 'em.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.050
Totally.

10:49.084 --> 10:50.317
You and I, we should
hang out some time, huh?

10:50.352 --> 10:51.752
Grab a drink?

10:51.787 --> 10:53.421
Sure.
Where are you living now?

10:53.455 --> 10:54.955
The air vents.

10:54.990 --> 10:58.025
I live in the air vents
of the school. Shhhh!

10:58.060 --> 11:04.899
I'm free, Jeff. Free!

11:04.933 --> 11:08.869
I gotta get back in that class.

11:08.887 --> 11:13.373
Real Dean coming through...
Oh, my goodness spacious,

11:13.391 --> 11:15.176
vice dean...

11:15.210 --> 11:17.144
Is this where Greendale's money
is going?

11:17.179 --> 11:19.146
More accurately, Dean,

11:19.181 --> 11:20.948
it's where Greendale's money
comes from.

11:20.982 --> 11:24.218
Our air-conditioning program
has a job placement rate

11:24.252 --> 11:27.354
five times higher than the rest
of your school combined.

11:27.389 --> 11:30.558
Our alumnini donations
comprise 80%

11:30.592 --> 11:31.926
of your entire school's budget.

11:31.960 --> 11:35.162
And you want to know why
we think we deserve

11:35.197 --> 11:36.964
an espresso machine?!

11:36.998 --> 11:39.867
Well, I guess
I didn't know. I...

11:39.901 --> 11:42.436
And you never had to, Dean.
You could have lived

11:42.454 --> 11:44.572
the rest of your life
in blissful ignorance

11:44.606 --> 11:47.708
and died a happy,
pansexual imp.

11:47.742 --> 11:51.045
But you wanted
to feel power this year.

11:51.079 --> 11:54.582
Well, now, you're going
to feel my power

11:54.616 --> 11:58.452
as it surges downward from me,
straight through you,

11:58.487 --> 12:03.124
from nostril to rectum,
now until the end of time.

12:03.158 --> 12:06.093
And that's "whazup."

12:07.262 --> 12:09.963
I forgot everything you said
before "rectum"!

12:12.734 --> 12:13.984
Who are these guys?

12:14.019 --> 12:16.971
This is my legal team
because I think it's time

12:17.005 --> 12:18.372
we worked out a new agreement.

12:18.406 --> 12:20.174
He doesn't look like a lawyer.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.509
That's a barber.

12:21.543 --> 12:24.612
Because I'm also sick
of that ridiculous goatee.

12:24.646 --> 12:27.348
You look like
a white Lou Gossett, Jr.

12:32.087 --> 12:34.655
You deserve a bigger office.

12:34.689 --> 12:36.223
Biggest office I ever had.

12:36.258 --> 12:38.626
I'm here to apologize,
Dr. King,

12:38.660 --> 12:40.528
and beg you for a seat
in biology.

12:40.562 --> 12:42.296
I tell you what, 'N Sync,
you wanna learn about life?

12:42.330 --> 12:43.497
Give up the phone.

12:43.532 --> 12:45.399
Oh. You're asking me
for a bribe?

12:45.433 --> 12:48.035
I can't be bought, man.
You feel me?

12:48.069 --> 12:50.738
See, prison was my walls.

12:50.772 --> 12:53.073
But you put your walls up.

12:53.108 --> 12:55.476
You, and your phone,
and your attitude,

12:55.510 --> 12:56.911
and your fruit loops cologne.

12:56.945 --> 12:58.712
Your walls put up so tight, man,

12:58.747 --> 13:01.649
not even a blade of grass
could get through.

13:01.683 --> 13:04.485
But even if it did,
you wouldn't appreciate it.

13:04.519 --> 13:07.187
That's why you can't
come back to my class.

13:07.205 --> 13:09.490
What's your problem
with me, man?

13:09.524 --> 13:12.493
And don't act like it's not
about me specifically

13:12.527 --> 13:15.729
because you've been in...

13:15.764 --> 13:19.917
Busted!

13:23.972 --> 13:26.557
Hey!
Take it easy, Winger.

13:26.591 --> 13:27.775
Everything okay?

13:27.809 --> 13:29.560
It is now that I have this.

13:29.594 --> 13:32.546
This is my ticket
to getting back in the group.

13:32.581 --> 13:35.048
Hey! Hey!

13:36.268 --> 13:39.987
I want to be
in the group so bad!

13:43.024 --> 13:48.495
All right, let's smoke 'em
and choke 'em.

13:48.530 --> 13:51.832
No! No! N-n-n...

13:51.866 --> 13:54.235
Uh-oh!
What is that?

13:54.269 --> 13:57.671
Monkey gas!

13:57.706 --> 13:59.240
Monkey gas?

14:00.959 --> 14:06.413
Oh, my g...

14:39.581 --> 14:41.448
Abed?

14:41.466 --> 14:43.117
All your friends are here.

14:43.151 --> 14:44.118
They wanna talk to you.

14:44.152 --> 14:45.386
I don't get it.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.787
How is this different
from the way he always is?

14:46.821 --> 14:47.955
I don't want to push it,

14:47.989 --> 14:49.323
but this would be a great time
to baptize him.

14:49.357 --> 14:52.459
Abed, maybe this can be
your new favorite show.

14:52.494 --> 14:54.461
It's a British Sci-Fi series

14:54.496 --> 14:56.830
that's been on the air
since 1962.

14:56.865 --> 14:58.799
Britta, you've done enough,
okay?

14:58.833 --> 15:00.234
Why don't you go start
a ruiners' club?

15:00.268 --> 15:01.802
Oh wait, you'd probably
just ruin it.

15:01.836 --> 15:03.537
Well then,
I'd be doing a good job

15:03.571 --> 15:04.805
because it's a ruiners' club.

15:04.839 --> 15:06.540
You ruined my analogy.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.158
Guys, look!

15:16.751 --> 15:18.485
Blimey, inspector!

15:18.503 --> 15:19.837
Where have we wound up
this time?

15:19.871 --> 15:24.391
The question isn't where,
constable, but when.

15:24.426 --> 15:26.260
Inspector, look out!
Blorgons!

15:26.294 --> 15:29.330
Eradicate! Eradicate!

15:29.364 --> 15:31.699
This is the best show I've
ever seen in my entire life.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.636
Having fun without me again?

15:36.771 --> 15:40.607
Jeff, what happened?
You look 70.

15:40.642 --> 15:42.776
Abed has
a new favorite tv show, Jeff.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.728
It's called
Inspector Spacetime...

15:44.779 --> 15:47.548
Can it, boobs.
I came here to let you know

15:47.582 --> 15:50.484
that your best friend Pierce
is the one that got me

15:50.518 --> 15:53.620
kicked out of bio class
and the study group.

15:53.655 --> 15:56.657
It was a plan he hatched
from the beginning

15:56.691 --> 15:59.576
with his pal, Professor Kane.

15:59.627 --> 16:04.131
But, Jeff, that's a photo
I gave our professor

16:04.165 --> 16:08.368
of me visiting Hawthorne Wipes'
spokesman and rap artist

16:08.386 --> 16:10.471
Sugar Cube in prison
during the '90s.

16:10.505 --> 16:13.757
Well, th-th-they look alike.

16:13.808 --> 16:17.244
Uh, I guess they share one
important feature in your eyes.

16:17.278 --> 16:18.879
Well, that's not fair!

16:18.897 --> 16:21.482
Look, I-I-I-I
was standing far away,

16:21.516 --> 16:22.766
and I saw the prison uniform!

16:22.817 --> 16:25.052
Oh, Jeffrey!

16:25.086 --> 16:26.220
Oh, come on, obviously
I don't mean

16:26.254 --> 16:27.220
all black people are in prison!

16:27.238 --> 16:29.740
Oh!

16:29.774 --> 16:32.409
Jeff, clearly you have gone
off the deep end.

16:32.444 --> 16:33.727
Don't blame him.

16:33.762 --> 16:36.113
The table is powerful,
and being cut off from it...

16:36.164 --> 16:38.999
Shut the...

16:42.570 --> 16:46.573
I've become...
Agitated.

16:46.608 --> 16:49.042
I apologize.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.112
We'll continue this discourse
at a later date.

16:52.147 --> 16:53.347
Good night.

16:53.381 --> 16:55.983
He just needs some space.

16:59.437 --> 17:01.121
I'm going to kill
the one thing you love!

17:01.156 --> 17:02.773
I'm gonna kill it!

17:02.807 --> 17:07.978
As long as it breathes,
it controls our lives!

17:11.800 --> 17:13.099
I just came by to tell everyone

17:13.134 --> 17:16.002
this year isn't gonna be
that different.

17:16.037 --> 17:20.973
With the notable exception,
we really won't have any money.

17:21.009 --> 17:22.910
Have a nice night.

17:27.448 --> 17:29.465
What is with that guy?

17:32.752 --> 17:33.476
Did you find the monkey?

17:33.716 --> 17:35.650
No, but here's the invoice
for the gassing.

17:35.685 --> 17:38.954
Okay, as it turns out,
I cannot pay this...

17:38.988 --> 17:42.307
Or your salaries starting on...
Two weeks ago.

17:42.341 --> 17:45.977
But, what I do have are
these vouchers

17:46.012 --> 17:48.663
for the classes
of your choosing.

17:56.839 --> 17:59.407
You're lucky I need
my scuba certification.

18:08.534 --> 18:10.285
Okay, okay.

18:10.319 --> 18:12.387
I'm the one
living in your vents.

18:12.421 --> 18:14.022
I have no home and no job.

18:14.056 --> 18:18.159
Does that mean you'll work
for room and board?

18:22.965 --> 18:26.568
Okay, I was lying
the whole time.

18:26.602 --> 18:28.603
I didn't want the group
to evolve.

18:28.638 --> 18:31.373
I just didn't want Pierce
around. I hate him.

18:31.407 --> 18:36.945
Okay, but Jeff, what you did...
it's hard to get past that.

18:36.979 --> 18:38.396
I know you're already out
of the study group,

18:38.447 --> 18:41.616
but I'm gonna have to ask that
you stop being my friend.

18:43.219 --> 18:48.239
Okay, look, everybody,
here's the thing,

18:48.291 --> 18:51.293
I am not as evolved
as I said I was.

18:51.327 --> 18:54.629
The biology class was full,
so I told Professor Kane

18:54.664 --> 18:56.548
I'd pay him
a few thousand dollars to...

18:56.582 --> 18:57.582
K-kick Jeff out.

18:57.633 --> 18:59.134
What?!
Pierce!

18:59.168 --> 19:01.369
What?

19:01.387 --> 19:03.805
I can't believe Jeff attacked
a table with a fire axe

19:03.839 --> 19:06.141
and still only managed to be the
second craziest man in the room.

19:06.175 --> 19:09.077
Okay, everybody in favor of
voting Pierce out of the group?

19:09.111 --> 19:11.346
Stop! Stop!

19:11.380 --> 19:13.481
Pierce isn't crazy.

19:13.516 --> 19:16.785
The table...

19:16.819 --> 19:20.155
Is...Magic.

19:20.189 --> 19:21.823
As someone who's been
on the other side,

19:21.857 --> 19:24.225
I can tell you,

19:24.260 --> 19:26.795
it is a scary, lonely,
Chang-filled world out there,

19:26.829 --> 19:29.264
and sure, this group has
sprouted some legs,

19:29.298 --> 19:32.767
but why are we in such a rush
to leave the tide pool,

19:32.802 --> 19:35.337
when the only things
waiting for us on shore

19:35.371 --> 19:37.639
are the sands of time.

19:37.673 --> 19:40.642
And the hungry seagulls
of slowly growing apart.

19:40.676 --> 19:43.144
Man, I really need this
biology class.

19:49.301 --> 19:52.303
Pierce!

19:52.355 --> 19:54.456
Professor Kane has never taken
a bribe from anyone in his life.

19:54.490 --> 19:55.757
You feel me?

19:55.791 --> 20:00.061
Yeah, I lied, but you seem
to have a harder time

20:00.096 --> 20:01.446
being the bad guy than me.

20:01.480 --> 20:07.202
You're right. I do...

20:07.236 --> 20:09.270
Which, in a weird way,
makes me a pretty bad guy.

20:09.305 --> 20:10.772
We're one and the same.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.874
Please don't.

20:12.908 --> 20:15.443
Jeff, but you're still
kicked out of biology.

20:15.461 --> 20:17.746
Oh, I'm not worried about it.

20:17.780 --> 20:21.115
Life has a way
of breaking through.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.950
So, uh, here's what
I'm thinking.

20:22.968 --> 20:26.137
I'm a drug dealer, right?
And you're a scientist,

20:26.172 --> 20:28.723
so couldn't we get, like,

20:28.758 --> 20:31.459
a Breaking Bad
type of thing going?

20:31.494 --> 20:35.296
Sorry, star-face, you just
lost your seat in my class.

20:42.618 --> 20:44.402
There, now the table
is good as new.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.787
And so is Abed.

20:45.821 --> 20:48.122
Britta, I'm sorry I was
overprotective about it.

20:48.157 --> 20:49.339
I'll try and be more supportive
of you.

20:49.459 --> 20:51.059
Well, here's your first chance.

20:51.093 --> 20:53.912
Helping Abed has inspired me
to finally declare a major.

20:53.963 --> 20:56.431
I'm gonna study Psychology.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.333
Like in a research capacity?

20:58.367 --> 21:02.804
No, in a hands-on capacity.
I'm gonna be a therapist.

21:02.838 --> 21:05.840
Oh.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.643
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down.

21:08.677 --> 21:10.244
There's a new sheriff in town.

21:12.916 --> 21:19.328
- Oh, interesting. So this is
the year we all die. - Yes, it is.
