Will you put him in another
room? He's getting all riled up.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.051
Yeah, it's a very good...
very good point. Okay.

10:06.052 --> 10:07.303

It's just getting
to be so much work.

11:17.891 --> 11:19.642
I mean, looking after him,

11:19.643 --> 11:21.226
cleaning up his messes...

11:21.227 --> 11:22.728
Plus, he tried to hump Tina.

11:22.729 --> 11:24.063
Yeah, and he shit

11:24.064 --> 11:25.564
- on the bed.
- Oh, my God.

11:25.565 --> 11:27.282
That would explain that smell.

11:27.283 --> 11:31.370
Maybe he just doesn't
fit into our lifestyle.

11:31.371 --> 11:32.403
I think it's time.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.580
Come on, bro.

11:41.581 --> 11:43.549
Atta bro.

11:43.550 --> 11:45.384
This way. Come on, buddy.

11:45.385 --> 11:46.501
Come on, bud.

11:49.089 --> 11:50.589
Hey, bro.

11:50.590 --> 11:51.890
You're a good bro, aren't you?

11:51.891 --> 11:53.759
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.144

11:55.145 --> 11:57.396

11:58.565 --> 11:59.765
I bet you do.

11:59.766 --> 12:01.767
Aw, Salsa Verde!

12:01.768 --> 12:02.900
Sick!

12:05.822 --> 12:08.323
This place seems nice.

12:08.324 --> 12:10.109
Well, keeping our bros
happy and healthy

12:10.110 --> 12:12.277
- is our top priority.
- And you guys'll

12:12.278 --> 12:15.164
find a good new
best friend for him?

12:15.165 --> 12:17.499
We'll certainly do our best
in the 30-day time period.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.618
Why? What happens after 30 days?

12:19.619 --> 12:21.537
You know, we don't really
have the resources

12:21.538 --> 12:22.838
to keep the bros
here permanently.

12:22.839 --> 12:24.456
So if we can't find a friend

12:24.457 --> 12:26.258
for them in that time, it...

12:26.259 --> 12:27.793
it is our policy
to put them down.

12:27.794 --> 12:29.712
You mean kill them?

12:29.713 --> 12:31.296
It's very humane.

12:31.297 --> 12:32.765
First, we sedate the bros

12:32.766 --> 12:34.633
with a 12-pack of shitty beer,

12:34.634 --> 12:36.218
and then we inject their heart

12:36.219 --> 12:37.803
with a lethal dose
of sodium thiopental.

12:37.804 --> 12:39.388
No.

12:39.389 --> 12:40.856
Uh, that's...

12:40.857 --> 12:43.058
I don't think
I can do that to Mike.

12:43.059 --> 12:44.860
Mike is 27.

12:44.861 --> 12:46.895
Uh, that's very old for a bro.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.313
- Uh-huh.
- And you've probably noticed

12:48.314 --> 12:50.566
he can't party
as hard as he used to.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.735
Yeah, no, his...

12:52.736 --> 12:55.571
hangovers have been
getting worse and...

12:55.572 --> 12:57.289
he's having trouble dancing.

12:57.290 --> 12:58.741
Turn down, what's up!

12:58.742 --> 13:00.743
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:00.744 --> 13:01.994
No, I guess his...

13:01.995 --> 13:04.129
quality of life's pretty poor.

13:04.130 --> 13:06.665
You know, when a bro gets
to the age where he can't,

13:06.666 --> 13:09.134
you know, pound Patrón
and crush mad sloppy gash,

13:09.135 --> 13:13.005
the best option is often death.

13:16.748 --> 13:17.881
Initial here...

13:19.179 --> 13:20.646
Okay. Um...

13:22.015 --> 13:23.515
Can I just, uh, say, uh...

13:23.516 --> 13:24.816
- Just take a minute.
- Thank you.

13:28.772 --> 13:29.938
Hey. Hey.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.774
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:31.775 --> 13:33.609
- Okay, I'm gonna get going now.
- Okay.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.028
- I'll come with you. Let's get burritos.
- No, no.

13:36.029 --> 13:37.863
You got to stay here.

13:37.864 --> 13:39.497
- What?
- Yeah.

13:43.119 --> 13:44.536
Yeah.

13:44.537 --> 13:45.871
I love you, bro.

13:45.872 --> 13:48.340
I love you, too, dude.

13:48.341 --> 13:50.375
Oh.

13:50.376 --> 13:52.543
This door sucks.

13:53.847 --> 13:55.046
Hey.

13:58.685 --> 14:00.385
Oh, dude.

14:00.386 --> 14:02.187
I'm so hammered.

14:02.188 --> 14:03.522
I pounded those beers.

14:03.523 --> 14:05.224
You sure did, bro.

14:05.225 --> 14:06.725
I got to get my dick

14:06.726 --> 14:08.143
wet, son.

14:08.144 --> 14:09.978
You'll get your dick wet...

14:09.979 --> 14:11.446
in Heaven.

14:11.447 --> 14:13.398
Sick.

14:13.399 --> 14:15.484
Oh!

14:15.485 --> 14:16.735
Oh, my God!

14:16.736 --> 14:18.737
No! No, no!

14:18.738 --> 14:21.540
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

14:21.541 --> 14:23.659
Uh, hey, ma'am?

14:23.660 --> 14:25.711
Made a huge mistake. I-I...

14:25.712 --> 14:28.413
Um, I want my bro back.

14:28.414 --> 14:31.717
It's too late! Your bro
is property of the state.

14:31.718 --> 14:34.670
Prop-Property of the state? He's
my best friend in there.

14:34.671 --> 14:37.973
He's a menace! Bros are nothing
but a scourge on our city.

14:37.974 --> 14:40.008
Slamming shots, pissing in
the streets, shouting "YOLO."

14:40.009 --> 14:42.261
They should all be exterminated!

14:42.262 --> 14:43.679
Exterminated?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.763
Okay. All right.

14:51.971 --> 14:54.356
Hey, what's all that, uh...?

14:54.357 --> 14:56.607
Hey, stop!

14:59.112 --> 15:00.579
Guards! Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:00.581 --> 15:02.282
Hey, stop! Stop 'em!

15:02.282 --> 15:04.032
Hey, come on right now.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.667
Get down!

15:05.668 --> 15:08.120
Bro release!

15:08.121 --> 15:10.172
Come on! Come on!

15:13.376 --> 15:14.927
Come on! Come on!

15:16.629 --> 15:19.097
- What is this place?
- A place where bros

15:19.098 --> 15:21.266
can run free.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.768
Oh, sick!

15:22.769 --> 15:23.969
Naked ladies!

15:25.638 --> 15:27.890
- Aren't you coming?
- I got to get back

15:27.891 --> 15:29.942
to Rachel. We're going to Ikea.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.312
You got to get in there, bud,

15:33.313 --> 15:35.146
before they run out of wings.

15:41.037 --> 15:42.988
Good-bye, bro.

15:42.989 --> 15:46.074
I want some tittays!

15:47.961 --> 15:50.161
Yeah!

15:52.996 --> 15:54.664
- Oh, it's Malbec.
- Oh!

15:54.665 --> 15:57.333
Right? Rachel and I love Malbec.

15:57.334 --> 15:59.368
Yeah.

15:59.370 --> 16:01.612
Um, we're so glad
you guys could come out, because

16:01.614 --> 16:04.774
we actually have a bit of
an announcement to make. Honey?

16:04.775 --> 16:06.108
My lease is up at the end

16:06.109 --> 16:07.527
of the month,

16:07.528 --> 16:08.778
and Josh and I spend
so much time

16:08.779 --> 16:10.997
together already
that we figured...

16:10.998 --> 16:13.249
Why not get
surgically conjoined?

16:15.252 --> 16:17.036
- What?
- Wow.

16:17.037 --> 16:19.789
Do-Doesn't that
seem a little too soon

16:19.790 --> 16:21.624
maybe to be making that step?

16:21.625 --> 16:23.960
Leo and I have
been together for

16:23.961 --> 16:27.713
four years now, and... and we
still have separate bodies.

16:27.714 --> 16:29.015
- Oh.
- Yeah. No, I know.

16:29.016 --> 16:30.466
That's you guys, though.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.852
I mean, each relationship moves
at its own pace.

16:32.853 --> 16:34.687
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- I believe.

16:34.688 --> 16:37.607
I mean, I have no doubt that you
guys will get to where we're at

16:37.608 --> 16:38.975
one of these days, but, uh...

16:38.976 --> 16:41.143
- Maybe.
- You know, may-maybe.

16:41.144 --> 16:44.313
Uh, but for us,
it was, like, why wait?

16:44.314 --> 16:45.815
We're soul mates.

16:45.816 --> 16:47.700
Mmm.

16:47.701 --> 16:50.403
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Mmm. Mmm.

17:27.357 --> 17:30.860
I know. I just thought it was like a
dreamlike memento. Oh, my gosh, yes.

17:30.861 --> 17:32.828
I thought the same thing
when I read it, yeah.

17:32.829 --> 17:36.488
- What did you think?
- The sentence structure...

17:56.687 --> 17:59.355
- Are you ready to turn the page?
- Not yet.

17:59.356 --> 18:01.973
Not... yet...

18:05.228 --> 18:07.313
I don't even know
what this sentence...

18:07.314 --> 18:10.149
You know, it's been
a while since we've...

18:10.150 --> 18:11.817
- What?
- You know.

18:11.818 --> 18:13.786
Oh. Oh, yeah.

18:13.787 --> 18:17.657
Yeah. Uh, do... do you want to?

18:17.658 --> 18:19.909
I mean, if you want
to, I would do that.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.377
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

18:21.378 --> 18:22.795
- Good idea.
- Okay.

18:22.796 --> 18:24.163
- That's a terrific idea.
- Yeah.

18:24.165 --> 18:25.632
- All right?
- Um...

18:25.632 --> 18:27.717
- Okay, so...
- Okay.

18:27.718 --> 18:29.418
Can you... can you
fold... folding?

18:29.419 --> 18:30.836
- I'm folding.
- Okay, gonna fold.

18:30.837 --> 18:32.171
- Can... uh, folding?
- Try my best.

18:32.172 --> 18:33.923
I'm trying to fold.

18:33.924 --> 18:35.925
- There we go. Okay.
- Okay, can you...?

18:35.926 --> 18:38.511
I can't do it. Maybe if I...
Maybe if I took a rib out.

18:38.512 --> 18:40.262
- Okay, well, you know what?
- Maybe if you would've

18:40.263 --> 18:41.731
tried harder in yoga,
we'd be more flexible.

18:41.732 --> 18:42.932
Are you kidding me?

18:42.933 --> 18:44.233
If you don't want
to do this anymore,

18:44.234 --> 18:45.267
than you should
just say something.

18:45.268 --> 18:48.020
- Of course I want to do this.
- If you don't find us attractive anymore,

18:48.021 --> 18:49.488
- than you should just tell me...
- I just...

18:49.489 --> 18:51.824
You're the one that needs the
mood to be right all the time.

18:51.825 --> 18:53.109
Because you don't
communicate with me.

18:53.110 --> 18:55.778
- I don't always know what you're thinking.
- No, no, no, this is on you, not me.

18:55.779 --> 18:57.279
What happened to us?

18:57.280 --> 18:58.948
It's like all we
do is bicker now.

18:58.949 --> 19:00.416
I don't know.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.285
It's like there's...

19:03.286 --> 19:06.922
There's a distance between us.

19:06.923 --> 19:08.874
Yeah.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.593
<i>Yeah, that's...
No, that's my mix CD.</i>

19:10.594 --> 19:12.511
Yeah.

19:12.512 --> 19:14.797
Um, who gets the toaster?

19:14.798 --> 19:16.182
Oh, you can keep it.

19:16.183 --> 19:17.717
Yeah. Okay.

19:17.718 --> 19:19.018
- Well, who gets the bowels?
- Ooh.

19:19.019 --> 19:21.520
Uh, do you mind
if I hang on to those?

19:21.521 --> 19:24.440
I just feel like
I use them way more than you do.

19:24.441 --> 19:27.142
Sure. Um...

19:28.695 --> 19:30.896
Burp!

19:30.897 --> 19:34.200
Um... on three?

19:34.201 --> 19:36.402
Yeah. Yeah?

19:37.102 --> 19:39.520
One, two, three.

19:41.741 --> 19:43.991
Oh, God!

19:47.041 --> 19:50.970
Oh, shit, man. I'm sorry, dude.
