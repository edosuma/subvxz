WEBVTT

00:05.249 --> 00:08.112
Bea Smith'll be dead by 3pm.

00:08.117 --> 00:09.428
Sonia's not saying much.

00:09.434 --> 00:11.463
Just stay close to her and listen.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.568
The way to get people talking is
to let them fill in the silence.

00:14.574 --> 00:18.478
I think you must be pretty messed up
to get involved with Kaz and Ferguson.

00:20.126 --> 00:21.970
I've decided to have the operation.

00:21.976 --> 00:23.275
Let's go Conway.

00:31.673 --> 00:33.548
This group, the Red Right Hand.

00:33.554 --> 00:35.594
I'm calling to report the
identity of their leader.

00:35.599 --> 00:37.795
It's a woman called Karen Proctor.

00:37.801 --> 00:40.005
Would you like to hear
the call that put you away?

00:40.236 --> 00:42.641
You fucking traitor, liar!

00:42.647 --> 00:43.847
Liar!

00:43.853 --> 00:46.361
Bea! Push the panic button!

00:46.695 --> 00:48.053
Argh!

00:48.967 --> 00:50.170
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:50.176 --> 00:52.670
- Just help her! She's not breathing!
- Bea, can you hear me?

01:54.764 --> 01:56.600
Mum!

01:58.615 --> 02:00.606
Mum.

02:05.613 --> 02:06.813
Mum.

02:09.491 --> 02:12.167
Mum, Mum? Mummy!

02:12.173 --> 02:14.028
Mum. Mum?

02:15.634 --> 02:18.546
Mum, Mum, Mum, Mum...

02:44.771 --> 02:45.976
Help!

03:01.964 --> 03:03.957
I was just following Kaz.

03:03.963 --> 03:07.036
And what did she tell you when
she started towards the kitchen?

03:07.042 --> 03:08.908
Nothing... she...
just... "Come with me".

03:08.914 --> 03:10.547
She didn't tell you what she'd heard?

03:11.761 --> 03:12.961
No.

03:12.967 --> 03:14.571
Didn't say anything about Bea Smith?

03:14.577 --> 03:15.777
No.

03:19.244 --> 03:21.908
I... I don't think that
she knew that Bea was there.

03:21.914 --> 03:23.406
I had no idea about Bea,

03:23.664 --> 03:27.002
Ferguson was supposed to be on
kitchen duty. That's why I went there.

03:27.008 --> 03:30.131
And there was no other member
of the kitchen team there?

03:32.931 --> 03:35.995
So, what did you see when you
first stepped into the kitchen?

03:36.001 --> 03:39.784
Um, Bea was... unconscious.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.299
It looked like there'd been a fight.

03:43.305 --> 03:44.961
Had Ferguson's arm been burned?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.682
Can't remember.

03:48.376 --> 03:50.049
I was too worried about Bea.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.819
They were both on the floor.

03:51.824 --> 03:55.573
Bea was unconscious and
Ferguson was screaming in pain.

03:55.579 --> 03:56.789
Already?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.775
So...

03:59.781 --> 04:04.955
Mr. Jackson played you a recording
that incriminated Joan Ferguson.

04:04.961 --> 04:07.936
You raced to the kitchen where,
in an incredible coincidence,

04:07.942 --> 04:11.209
Ferguson had already been
injured but not by you.

04:11.824 --> 04:13.474
Is that your story?

04:17.228 --> 04:20.438
I think Joan Ferguson was
trying to kill Bea Smith,

04:20.444 --> 04:21.915
and I think you knew.

04:45.446 --> 04:47.992
Hi. How're you feeling?

04:48.813 --> 04:51.461
Oh, I'm okay.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.975
We've all been very
concerned about you, Bea.

04:54.588 --> 04:56.905
What have you been told
about what happened last week?

04:58.176 --> 05:01.287
Just that I nearly drowned.

05:01.293 --> 05:05.349
Mmm. What we know was that you were
found unconscious in the kitchen.

05:05.355 --> 05:08.817
Now Kaz Proctor, Allie Novak
and Joan Ferguson were there.

05:08.823 --> 05:10.029
Where's Ferguson now?

05:10.035 --> 05:14.258
She's in the hospital. She sustained
serious burns, we don't know how.

05:15.303 --> 05:18.969
When the officers arrived,
you'd taken a lot of water.

05:18.975 --> 05:21.600
Mr. Jackson had to perform CPR.

05:22.709 --> 05:26.744
Also, your blood tests revealed
a huge dose of Rohypnol.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.725
How... do you know how

05:28.731 --> 05:30.120
- that got into your system?
- No.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.948
So you have no memory of what
brought you to the kitchen?

05:42.839 --> 05:44.039
No.

05:44.558 --> 05:48.641
Bea, the hospital
reported some scarring.

05:50.210 --> 05:53.665
Not from the attack,
but from well before.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.465
Scarring that suggests
that you have been...

05:59.556 --> 06:01.564
struggling for some time.

06:05.393 --> 06:07.372
I can't remember anything, sorry.

06:08.489 --> 06:10.918
Be really good if you
could talk about it.

06:12.799 --> 06:14.908
- Any of the prisoners...
- No.

06:16.197 --> 06:19.212
- Anyone on the outside you can call?
- There's no one.

06:21.626 --> 06:25.469
Memory loss is consistent with the
amount of sedative found in her system,

06:25.635 --> 06:28.637
but, her demeanour is
extremely shut down,

06:28.643 --> 06:31.153
almost to the point of
being clinically depressed.

06:31.738 --> 06:34.555
And there is evidence of self-harming.

06:35.530 --> 06:38.513
- Self-harming?
- Cutting, of the inner thigh.

06:38.519 --> 06:40.119
From before this attack?

06:40.124 --> 06:43.775
Clearly there were some severe
underlying problems prior to that.

06:43.781 --> 06:47.336
Right, so we have one prisoner
who is clinically depressed,

06:47.342 --> 06:48.655
another in hospital,

06:48.661 --> 06:51.590
and Proctor knows why. She knows
exactly what happened in that kitchen.

06:51.692 --> 06:53.377
If you give me five
minutes with Proctor...

06:53.382 --> 06:54.616
- Absolutely not!
- Look, I would have

06:54.621 --> 06:56.667
some credit with her now that I
have played her that recording.

06:56.672 --> 06:58.771
Which is what triggered
this all in the first place.

06:58.777 --> 07:01.142
- And saved Bea's life.
- That is not a justification.

07:01.148 --> 07:03.210
Will, this is the last
time I will say this.

07:03.216 --> 07:05.968
You are to have no further
contact with Proctor,

07:05.974 --> 07:09.194
or her crew under any
circumstances. Do you understand?

07:11.861 --> 07:13.434
Do you understand?

07:17.407 --> 07:18.607
Yes, Governor.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.991
Bea, I'm here as your peer worker.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.650
Are you okay? Is there
anything you need?

07:39.003 --> 07:41.386
We heard what Ferguson
tried to do to ya.

07:41.392 --> 07:43.814
What? What did you hear?

07:43.820 --> 07:45.431
That the two of you fought...

07:46.345 --> 07:48.062
and she tried to drown ya.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.680
Fight?

07:51.195 --> 07:52.785
It wasn't a fight.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.494
I was fucking unconscious.

07:56.522 --> 07:59.484
And it wasn't just Ferguson.
It was all your new mates, too.

07:59.724 --> 08:04.282
Ferguson, Kaz... Allie.

08:05.706 --> 08:07.373
Yeah, they set me up.

08:07.706 --> 08:11.110
They trapped me, they drugged
me and they tried to kill me.

08:12.964 --> 08:16.526
Yeah, all the scum that you
choose to be friends with.

08:19.284 --> 08:22.536
Oh, fuck! Get the fuck out of my sight!

08:25.068 --> 08:26.268
Argh!

08:27.391 --> 08:28.591
Boomer!

08:28.597 --> 08:30.300
So you think you can
kill one of us, do ya?

08:30.306 --> 08:32.187
- What?
- Do ya, hey?

08:32.193 --> 08:35.692
- Hey!
- No! I wasn't trying to kill her.

08:35.698 --> 08:38.166
That's bullshit!
That's fuckin' bullshit!

08:38.172 --> 08:40.325
Bea said it herself. I just saw her.

08:40.331 --> 08:44.164
She said you were working with Kaz
and Ferguson to trap her and kill her.

08:44.169 --> 08:45.554
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:45.560 --> 08:47.765
I would never hurt her. I
was just trying to save her.

08:47.771 --> 08:50.162
- What a fuckin' load of bullshit!
- No, no. Boomer. Boomer!

08:50.168 --> 08:53.355
Let's leave it, leave it.
Let's wait till Bea gets out.

08:53.361 --> 08:54.858
Cause you've seen
what happens when other

08:54.863 --> 08:56.586
people make decisions for her, yeah?

08:56.592 --> 08:59.162
Yeah. Well, when Bea does get out,

08:59.168 --> 09:02.627
you're going down, blondie. You
and your whole crew. All right?

09:03.236 --> 09:04.440
Yeah?

09:12.735 --> 09:13.963
Is she all right?

09:15.565 --> 09:16.945
She's alive.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.845
But, no, she's not all right.

09:55.407 --> 09:58.177
Hey, Novak? Where's Chambers?

09:58.183 --> 10:01.178
- Um, she was feeling sick and she...
- Out!

10:01.184 --> 10:02.456
- Bea! Bea,
- Let's go!

10:02.462 --> 10:03.676
- I didn't have anything to do with it!
- Come on. Move it!

10:03.681 --> 10:04.926
I swear to God. I didn't know

10:04.932 --> 10:06.785
- anything about it. Bea!
- Move out. Let's go!

10:07.327 --> 10:09.067
You have to believe me!

10:09.695 --> 10:12.495
I didn't know anything
about it, I swear.

10:19.657 --> 10:21.390
Your week's up, Proctor.

10:23.948 --> 10:27.312
You know Ferguson put
you in here for 12 years.

10:28.651 --> 10:30.097
Don't know why you'd
been protecting her.

10:30.102 --> 10:35.400
I can only assume that you're implicated
in some way in the attack on Bea Smith.

10:36.899 --> 10:39.534
If you come forward, if
you help us, we'll help you.

10:48.642 --> 10:51.300
Kaz. Did they question you?

10:51.306 --> 10:52.910
- What'd you say?
- Where's Ferguson?

10:52.916 --> 10:55.259
Oh fuck, who cares? She's
still in the hospital.

10:57.036 --> 10:58.785
And the other girls? How are they?

10:59.036 --> 11:00.567
They're confused Kaz.

11:00.573 --> 11:03.943
There's a bullshit rumour going around
that we were trying to murder Bea.

11:03.949 --> 11:05.255
You and me?

11:05.261 --> 11:09.420
Bea thinks that. She told Doreen and
I almost got bashed up because of it.

11:12.211 --> 11:14.221
You didn't know anything
about it, did you?

11:17.110 --> 11:19.320
Oh, fuck?

11:19.560 --> 11:21.448
Oh, fuck!

11:21.454 --> 11:23.477
I didn't know it was gonna go that far.

11:24.493 --> 11:27.693
Everything that bitch
told us was a fucking lie.

11:28.907 --> 11:31.035
You have to tell her I
had nothing to do with it.

11:31.329 --> 11:32.529
Why?

11:32.800 --> 11:36.229
She's not our enemy
Kaz! She didn't shop us!

11:36.235 --> 11:39.571
- Doesn't make her our friend either.
- She thinks I was setting her up!

11:40.194 --> 11:43.135
She thinks I was luring her
so she could be murdered!

11:43.712 --> 11:45.532
Why the fuck do you care so much?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.533
You're kidding me.

11:54.818 --> 11:57.740
You're on with her, aren't you?

12:00.342 --> 12:01.809
Since when?

12:03.529 --> 12:04.960
Not long.

12:05.393 --> 12:07.994
- So you in her crew now?
- No.

12:08.231 --> 12:10.240
She thinks I'm with you.

12:10.433 --> 12:13.020
She thinks I was with
you trying to murder her.

12:15.095 --> 12:17.800
I can't... Kaz, I can't...

12:17.806 --> 12:19.585
I can't have her thinking that.

12:20.860 --> 12:23.518
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't....

12:24.854 --> 12:26.054
Allie.

12:28.213 --> 12:29.718
I need you to go.

12:32.409 --> 12:34.204
I need you to get the fuck out.

12:34.514 --> 12:35.715
Go!

12:58.206 --> 12:59.406
Wait.

13:00.748 --> 13:03.370
- Just want to explain.
- Oh yeah, what do you need to explain?

13:03.376 --> 13:05.061
I just want to say you were right.

13:05.456 --> 13:08.045
I know it was Ferguson
who shopped us, not you.

13:09.168 --> 13:11.153
I nearly fucking died.

13:11.647 --> 13:12.847
I know.

13:14.157 --> 13:17.064
- I feel terrible about that.
- Oh, she feels terrible.

13:17.366 --> 13:21.055
If there is anything I can
do to make it up to you...

13:21.464 --> 13:24.043
You've been on your soapbox for months

13:24.049 --> 13:25.864
hanging shit on me, you hypocrite.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.659
Yapping on about helping the women

13:27.665 --> 13:30.799
and all this time you were protecting
the very woman that put you in here.

13:32.885 --> 13:36.971
You're nothing but a fucked up little
girl who's trying to save the world.

13:38.432 --> 13:41.822
And all you're doing is dragging
down the women you say you protect.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.635
You're useless!

13:52.374 --> 13:53.577
You're right.

13:54.457 --> 13:55.657
I am.

13:57.047 --> 13:59.547
And all I can do is say I'm sorry.

14:00.946 --> 14:03.828
For believing her, for
working against you, and for...

14:07.031 --> 14:09.829
and for making Allie to
prostitute herself to get to you.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.957
I'll never forgive myself for that.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.029
Smith, how are you?

14:38.035 --> 14:40.520
Oh, I'm a bit sick of
answering that question.

14:41.078 --> 14:42.508
Can you remember anything more

14:42.514 --> 14:45.044
- since you spoke with Ms Westfall?
- And that one too.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.584
No.

14:46.799 --> 14:48.219
When can I go back to my unit?

14:48.225 --> 14:50.829
Soon, but first I'd
like you to come with me.

14:51.618 --> 14:53.971
We don't have any
witnesses to your attack.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.672
We don't have any surveillance, so
anything that jogs your memory...

14:58.477 --> 15:00.628
No, I told you, I-I-I
don't remember anything.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.476
No, take your time, just...

15:03.108 --> 15:04.314
be certain.

15:06.936 --> 15:08.338
You were found here.

15:09.015 --> 15:10.215
On the floor.

15:10.311 --> 15:12.700
Somebody help!

15:15.301 --> 15:17.373
That sink was full of water.

15:17.628 --> 15:19.589
The equipment room was open.

15:21.290 --> 15:23.303
There were some pots
and pans on the floor.

15:27.781 --> 15:29.847
- What is it?
- Can I go outside now?

15:30.509 --> 15:34.125
All I'm trying to do is make sure that
Ferguson gets put away, that is all.

15:35.229 --> 15:36.855
She was clearly trying to kill you.

15:36.861 --> 15:38.914
She wants to take you out
as a witness in her case.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.068
So, if you can remember
something, anything, that's it...

15:42.074 --> 15:44.599
- she's gone permanently.
- Can I go now?

15:45.494 --> 15:47.592
Ah, Governor, I think
we might have had enough.

15:48.908 --> 15:51.681
Well, you really fucked up, didn't ya?

15:51.978 --> 15:53.403
Fuckin' Freak lover!

15:54.598 --> 15:57.920
Nah, I reckon she'd want us to
bash 'em as soon as we saw 'em.

15:57.926 --> 16:01.405
No, Bea wouldn't want anyone
makin' decisions for her, Booms.

16:01.411 --> 16:03.609
No, well she lets Maxie
make decisions for her.

16:03.615 --> 16:05.166
Well, Max is a bit more...

16:05.172 --> 16:06.372
you know...

16:06.666 --> 16:07.866
More what?

16:08.606 --> 16:11.342
There are thinkers and
there are doers, Susan.

16:11.348 --> 16:13.879
- Mmm. Mm.
- You are classified as a doer.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.761
Are you sayin' that I don't think?

16:15.767 --> 16:19.652
On the contrary, if I was to
choose, I would always pick a doer.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.707
My husband was a thinker.

16:21.713 --> 16:24.378
He would sit around all
day making grand plans.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.818
I was the one that got things done.

16:25.824 --> 16:27.154
Oi, oi! There she is.

16:27.159 --> 16:29.604
You're to check in with me daily
but if you find it more of a

16:29.610 --> 16:32.322
struggle to be with the women,
I want you to come and find me.

16:32.328 --> 16:33.550
Right away, hmm?

16:33.556 --> 16:37.860
Hey. Bea. Hello. You all right, lovey?

16:38.257 --> 16:39.457
Bea.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.604
Come on, darl. Let's get you in, eh?

16:58.969 --> 17:00.828
I would've done it, like, yesterday.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.880
Like, bashed Allie,
right there in the shower.

17:02.886 --> 17:05.387
Right, and then... and then
bashed Kaz right there in the yard.

17:05.393 --> 17:06.869
You know, but Liz said "No".

17:06.876 --> 17:10.653
Yeah, because I wanted to
wait to see what the plan was.

17:10.659 --> 17:14.361
Oh, yeah, yeah, I thought that too.
Like, wait and see what the plan was...

17:14.366 --> 17:17.203
but while we're waitin'
just, like, bash 'em. Yeah?

17:17.596 --> 17:20.201
Um, can you... can you, like,
at least say who was right?

17:20.207 --> 17:23.359
Can you just give her some space, Booms.

17:23.366 --> 17:25.597
More than likely, it's depression.

17:25.603 --> 17:28.935
Oh, my God. This has got
nothin' to do with you, princess.

17:28.941 --> 17:31.530
I'm very familiar with
depression, that's all.

17:31.536 --> 17:35.528
I mean, I dealt with my doses of
Zoloft the second I came in here.

17:35.534 --> 17:36.760
Good for you,

17:36.766 --> 17:39.144
- lady fuckin' up your own arse!
- Boomer!

17:39.150 --> 17:41.772
No, she's a fuckin'
know-it-all. Now it's depression.

17:41.777 --> 17:42.977
My friend, Helen,

17:42.983 --> 17:44.770
- suffered from it.
- The missing body?

17:44.776 --> 17:47.534
Oh, for fuck's sake, Boomer?!

17:47.593 --> 17:49.392
It used to get her so down,

17:49.398 --> 17:52.482
there was absolutely nothing
I could do to pick her up.

17:53.287 --> 17:55.943
My greatest fear was
that she finally just...

17:56.111 --> 17:59.750
gave in... to the darkness.

18:09.142 --> 18:12.410
Because of the severity of her burns,
we'll be able to hold her in medical,

18:12.417 --> 18:16.237
and I am planning on keeping her
there right up until her court dates.

18:17.343 --> 18:19.585
So, we need a team to
manage her protection

18:19.591 --> 18:21.342
and I want a volunteer to lead it.

18:23.059 --> 18:24.263
I'll do it.

18:25.474 --> 18:28.196
Ferguson's defence is that there
is a conspiracy against her.

18:28.202 --> 18:31.506
So, no missteps, no threats.
Everything 100 percent

18:31.512 --> 18:32.984
- by the book. Is that clear?
- Yes, Governor.

18:32.989 --> 18:34.193
- Yep.
- Okay, thank you.

18:37.708 --> 18:39.410
Don't let her get in your head.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.366
Copy that.

18:45.179 --> 18:46.379
Governor.

18:46.601 --> 18:47.801
How's the pain?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.494
Manageable.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.999
You'll be held in here, under
the supervision of Mr. Stewart,

18:54.005 --> 18:55.510
for the foreseeable future.

18:58.144 --> 18:59.890
Seems a little unnecessary.

19:02.121 --> 19:04.495
Well, for your category of injury

19:04.501 --> 19:08.342
the infection guidelines recommend
total exclusion from communal areas.

19:08.595 --> 19:10.590
Those guidelines were devised by you.

19:12.102 --> 19:15.096
Petty victories are important
to you, aren't they, Vera.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.065
It's all over.

19:23.191 --> 19:26.641
Your alliance with Proctor
is dead, she despises you.

19:27.026 --> 19:29.581
And your court case is next week.

19:29.587 --> 19:31.331
You've failed.

19:37.305 --> 19:38.877
How's Bea Smith?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.507
Oh, she made a complete recovery.

19:52.838 --> 19:54.158
Down there, and then you go whee

19:54.164 --> 19:55.980
- up like that. This is purl,
- Oh.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.791
- so, you come in under, for purl.
- Oh, I see.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.179
Oh, no, no, no. No, what
the fuck are you doin' here?!

20:00.185 --> 20:02.023
- I just wanna have a word.
- No, get the fuck out, now!

20:02.028 --> 20:03.591
- Can you just give me a minute, please?
- You know, piss off,

20:03.596 --> 20:04.958
- Bea! Bea!
- out of here, right now!

20:04.963 --> 20:07.046
- Bea, can you please...?
- Or I will punch your tits in,

20:07.051 --> 20:08.360
- all right?!
- Boomer.

20:13.287 --> 20:15.286
Can I have a word with
you in private, please?

20:18.047 --> 20:19.711
Nah. Just say what
you've gotta say here.

20:20.617 --> 20:22.282
And I know what you think...

20:22.930 --> 20:24.309
but I swear to you,

20:24.336 --> 20:27.881
I had nothing to do with
any of it. I had no idea.

20:27.887 --> 20:30.079
Oh really, that's not
what Kaz said. So...

20:30.624 --> 20:32.824
you guys better get
your stories straight.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.030
Yeah.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.600
Wait, what?

20:35.606 --> 20:37.382
Yeah, she said you were the bait.

20:38.145 --> 20:41.684
- No. Bea. I had nothing to do with it.
- Was that always the plan?

20:43.558 --> 20:46.007
- Huh? To get rid of me?
- No!

20:46.013 --> 20:48.669
Bea, I had no idea about
it. I was trying to save you.

20:48.675 --> 20:51.099
- No, no, no, no. Mr. Jackson saved me.
- No, before that. I was the one that

20:51.104 --> 20:54.338
- pulled you out of the fucking water.
- You know what, shut your fucking face!

20:55.323 --> 20:56.656
You're all the same!

20:57.346 --> 21:01.368
You're nothing but a
lying, junkie, street whore.

21:02.047 --> 21:05.778
You set me up for those fuckers and
I was stupid enough to fall for it.

21:05.784 --> 21:06.984
Bea...

21:06.990 --> 21:10.591
Nah, just get the fuck out of my
unit, while you can still walk.

21:10.597 --> 21:11.797
Bea?

21:15.258 --> 21:16.458
Hey.

21:16.747 --> 21:18.426
You heard her, get out!

21:25.170 --> 21:26.932
- What did you say to her?
- What?

21:27.242 --> 21:28.443
Argh!

21:28.449 --> 21:30.457
What did you fucking say?!

21:30.779 --> 21:33.763
- Whatever she said!
- You told her I was a part of it!

21:33.769 --> 21:36.851
You told her I got close
to her just to set her up!

21:36.857 --> 21:38.346
Argh!

21:39.114 --> 21:41.281
You're supposed to be my friend!

21:41.287 --> 21:42.487
I am!

21:42.759 --> 21:46.309
I am the only one that
gives a shit about you!

21:46.315 --> 21:47.515
Fuck off!

21:49.009 --> 21:51.985
You did it deliberately
just to fuck me up!

21:58.522 --> 21:59.722
Bea!

22:43.012 --> 22:44.727
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.381
- How's she going?
- Uh...

22:47.387 --> 22:48.668
she won't talk to us.

22:48.674 --> 22:51.532
She had a screaming match with Allie
and then she shut herself in there.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.239
You ever seen her like this before?

22:54.262 --> 22:55.999
Only when her daughter died.

23:04.221 --> 23:05.921
That must have hurt like hell.

23:07.210 --> 23:09.218
The memories are... are fractured.

23:10.233 --> 23:11.735
Okay. All done.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.132
Thank you.

23:13.138 --> 23:16.106
I s'pose it's hard to understand
how Smith managed that.

23:16.502 --> 23:17.933
If she was unconscious.

23:20.122 --> 23:25.153
I do hope the governor didn't select
you for your interrogation skills.

23:25.159 --> 23:27.461
Nope. I volunteered for this.

23:28.015 --> 23:31.843
You may be many things, but one of them
was an extremely effective governor.

23:32.747 --> 23:35.531
You're expecting some sort of tutorial.

23:37.224 --> 23:39.536
What's your opinion of Governor Bennett?

23:40.281 --> 23:44.906
I think she's a very
clear and intuitive leader.

23:44.912 --> 23:46.270
How diplomatic.

23:47.455 --> 23:49.119
I trained Vera...

23:49.361 --> 23:52.916
so I have to confess that I'd hoped
for a stronger, bolder leadership.

23:53.369 --> 23:55.658
But I suppose I have to
make allowances given...

23:55.664 --> 23:57.736
the circumstances of her promotion.

24:00.448 --> 24:01.685
Nobody told you?

24:02.870 --> 24:04.070
Oh.

24:05.593 --> 24:07.810
Well, the board was
forced to promote her,

24:07.816 --> 24:10.723
when Vera threatened to sue
over her hepatitis C status.

24:11.211 --> 24:12.411
It was all very...

24:12.417 --> 24:13.617
messy.

24:15.789 --> 24:18.756
Would you be able to supply me
with a visitor application form?

24:19.947 --> 24:22.394
- Shayne Butler?
- What, you know him?

24:22.400 --> 24:26.173
He is the son of a
former Blackmore inmate,

24:26.179 --> 24:29.358
that Joan Ferguson was
extremely attached to.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.726
Is there anything else I should know?

24:34.151 --> 24:35.614
What? Tell me.

24:36.203 --> 24:37.564
She was...

24:38.234 --> 24:41.064
- she was just stirring.
- Oh, about what?

24:41.564 --> 24:43.933
Look, it's obviously ridiculous, but,

24:43.939 --> 24:45.754
she implied that...

24:46.151 --> 24:49.386
you became Governor when
you contracted hepatitis C

24:49.392 --> 24:50.858
and threatened to sue the board.

24:55.177 --> 24:57.653
Anything else she says about
staff members, or prisoners,

24:57.659 --> 24:59.151
or the case, anything...

25:00.302 --> 25:02.612
- I wanna know.
- Of course.

25:03.574 --> 25:04.774
Thank you.

25:16.161 --> 25:17.361
_

25:17.895 --> 25:20.153
Oh, there she is.

25:20.159 --> 25:22.283
Ooh, oh, hello.

25:23.691 --> 25:25.182
Ha-ha-ha.

25:26.652 --> 25:29.567
Ooh! Hi! Oh.

25:29.573 --> 25:32.390
Just... I'm not quite
ready for hugs yet, Booms.

25:32.396 --> 25:34.958
Oh, wow, love.

25:34.964 --> 25:36.663
Mmm. Hi Sonia.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.641
- Good to see you looking so well.
- Thank you.

25:38.646 --> 25:41.399
- Dors, how are you?
- Better now you're back!

25:41.405 --> 25:42.852
- Oh, sweetie.
- Yeah, you still look

25:42.858 --> 25:44.475
like you even without the...

25:45.233 --> 25:46.743
um, the...

25:47.209 --> 25:51.295
- The breasts?
- No, I just, um, meant... meant... Oh.

25:53.795 --> 25:55.105
Where's Bea?

25:55.419 --> 25:56.619
Oh...

25:57.373 --> 26:00.311
Well, she's coming in to see you later.
She's a bit tied up at the moment.

26:00.317 --> 26:02.219
- Is she okay?
- Of course.

26:02.225 --> 26:04.715
- Liz?
- Yeah, yeah, she sends her love.

26:04.721 --> 26:07.890
- Ah, I brought you some magazines.
- Oh, thank you.

26:07.896 --> 26:09.141
I got you some licorice.

26:09.146 --> 26:10.552
I brought you biscuits.

26:11.385 --> 26:12.588
Wow.

26:13.013 --> 26:14.688
I don't have a gift. Sorry.

26:14.694 --> 26:17.122
Oh Sonia, you don't have
to bring me anything.

26:17.128 --> 26:20.159
But I'd be very happy to cover
the cost of your reconstruction

26:20.165 --> 26:21.539
when the time comes.

26:21.545 --> 26:22.745
My what?

26:22.751 --> 26:25.947
Please, Maxine, it's nothing,
honestly. I would love to.

26:25.953 --> 26:28.675
I know the best man in
town, Dr. Marrenucci.

26:28.681 --> 26:30.515
He's done half the
breasts in Chapel Street

26:30.521 --> 26:31.935
and he is an artist, honestly.

26:31.941 --> 26:34.928
- And I can get you in without a wait.
- You got to be fuckin' kidding.

26:34.933 --> 26:36.133
- Boomer.
- No, she can't just

26:36.139 --> 26:37.366
come in here and chuck around cash

26:37.371 --> 26:38.911
- and make us her friends.
- No that's not

26:38.916 --> 26:40.117
- No, stop sticking up for her...
- what she's doing...

26:40.122 --> 26:41.451
Why the fuck are you always sticking

26:41.456 --> 26:42.740
- up for her? Yeah you are.
- I'm not.

26:42.745 --> 26:44.567
- You go all suck face around her.
- Okay, let's

26:44.572 --> 26:46.502
- just come out. Come out. No, no.
- I don't understand. I don't

26:46.507 --> 26:47.975
fuckin' understand.

26:48.150 --> 26:50.428
What? Tell me! Just tell me.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.836
- I'm so sorry.
- Now, what Sonia did was a

26:51.841 --> 26:53.492
really kind gesture and you had...

26:57.313 --> 26:58.646
Hey, Bea?

26:59.431 --> 27:00.631
I'm good.

27:00.696 --> 27:02.955
I'm not here for a
session. You got a visitor.

27:02.961 --> 27:04.161
What?

27:04.329 --> 27:06.113
And, it's not optional.

27:37.693 --> 27:38.997
Hey, Red.

27:42.569 --> 27:43.825
Oh!

27:47.564 --> 27:48.764
How are ya?

27:51.568 --> 27:52.942
You're right.

27:54.636 --> 27:57.436
So, what did Bridget say to you?

27:57.636 --> 27:58.836
Nothing.

28:00.347 --> 28:01.932
You're a shit liar.

28:02.291 --> 28:04.291
Nah, I'm an awesome liar, Red.

28:04.506 --> 28:06.149
Just thought you'd been stuck without me

28:06.155 --> 28:08.463
for so long you might
be really feeling it now.

28:10.217 --> 28:12.162
I thought I'd died, Franky.

28:13.346 --> 28:14.546
For a sec.

28:14.967 --> 28:16.381
You might have.

28:17.138 --> 28:18.549
It felt good.

28:19.062 --> 28:20.268
Peaceful.

28:20.274 --> 28:23.451
Yeah, well I heard you were pretty
dosed up on roofies so not surprising.

28:23.457 --> 28:25.056
Nah, it was more than that.

28:28.753 --> 28:30.655
I thought I could see Debbie.

28:31.082 --> 28:32.816
I heard her calling to me.

28:35.802 --> 28:37.209
I'm tired.

28:38.923 --> 28:41.207
Fuck, I'm so tired, Franky.

28:48.468 --> 28:49.668
I...

28:50.978 --> 28:52.702
I've got no reason to be here.

28:52.708 --> 28:54.184
That's bullshit, Red.

28:54.665 --> 28:57.876
You gotta be here. And
you've got the girls.

28:58.087 --> 29:02.233
Liz. Dors. Booms. Maxie.

29:04.801 --> 29:06.621
I trusted someone.

29:07.020 --> 29:08.719
I let my guard down.

29:09.332 --> 29:12.180
- Who?
- Ah, you don't know her, she's new.

29:14.605 --> 29:16.489
Ah, it doesn't matter now anyway.

29:16.495 --> 29:17.705
Hang on...

29:19.291 --> 29:21.690
you let someone get under your skin.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.265
Oh!

29:25.100 --> 29:27.484
Did you let someone get in your pants?

29:27.490 --> 29:28.690
No!

29:28.844 --> 29:30.545
Holy fuck!

29:30.551 --> 29:33.200
- No, Franky, it wasn't like that.
- Yeah, it was.

29:33.321 --> 29:36.564
- I knew it. I knew you had it in ya.
- No! Franky.

29:36.570 --> 29:38.062
Who is she? Is she like me?

29:38.068 --> 29:39.446
I bet she was.

29:39.452 --> 29:41.448
She's a bit of a Franky
replacement, wasn't she?

29:42.027 --> 29:43.947
She's good looking obviously. Tatts?

29:44.238 --> 29:46.199
No, she's nothing like you.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.638
- Well, she's blonde.
- Eugh! Borin'.

29:49.644 --> 29:51.511
Nah, she wasn't boring.

29:54.997 --> 29:56.881
But... but, it wasn't real.

29:56.887 --> 29:58.826
Yeah, she was playing me.

30:00.726 --> 30:01.955
Do the other girls know?

30:01.961 --> 30:03.161
Not really.

30:03.974 --> 30:05.851
And don't you say a fucking thing.

30:06.016 --> 30:07.785
Who am I going to say anything to?

30:09.866 --> 30:11.780
Do you want my diagnosis, Red?

30:11.786 --> 30:12.986
Yeah.

30:13.288 --> 30:15.005
You had your heart broken.

30:16.179 --> 30:19.384
You got your heart broken
real good for the first time.

30:19.642 --> 30:21.784
And it fuckin' sucks, right?

30:22.846 --> 30:24.046
Yeah.

30:24.051 --> 30:25.660
But you're strong

30:26.160 --> 30:27.822
and you'll get through it.

30:28.472 --> 30:30.652
'Cause the girls need
you more than ever.

30:30.821 --> 30:32.696
They need their queen.

30:33.727 --> 30:35.055
And that's you.

30:37.719 --> 30:39.023
So what base did you get to?

30:39.029 --> 30:40.583
- Oh, God! I don't know what
- Come on!

30:40.589 --> 30:43.418
- the bases are.
- Just tell me. Of course you do.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.764
I'll just break it down for ya. You've
got fingers and you've got tongue.

30:45.769 --> 30:47.168
Shut up!

31:30.514 --> 31:31.969
Your visitor's here!

31:33.364 --> 31:35.139
Ah, yes.

31:35.145 --> 31:37.572
You must be proud of
yourself, engineering this.

31:37.578 --> 31:39.814
Outsmarting you would
be a rather insignificant

31:39.820 --> 31:41.063
achievement don't you think?

31:41.069 --> 31:44.430
It's just interesting that
you've listed him as a friend,

31:44.648 --> 31:46.773
given that you have so much
difficulty making those,

31:46.779 --> 31:49.156
and you haven't seen this
one since he was an infant.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.809
What a limited imagination you have.

31:55.718 --> 31:58.105
Make sure she's thoroughly searched,

31:58.111 --> 31:59.460
before and after.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.855
You've been talking to her, haven't you?

32:05.861 --> 32:07.061
Of course.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.924
Repeating our little conversation.

32:11.338 --> 32:12.918
It's obvious.

32:12.924 --> 32:17.391
When Vera experiences a humiliation,
she develops a certain militant edge.

32:19.941 --> 32:22.440
Look for the tightness in her jaw.

32:22.776 --> 32:24.478
You'd do well to be aware of it.

32:25.761 --> 32:28.690
If you can loosen it, she'll
be pathetically grateful.

32:30.307 --> 32:31.923
And pliable.

33:01.103 --> 33:02.532
Hello, Shayne.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.581
- Shayne Butler, Jianna's son.
- Will, yeah...

33:09.587 --> 33:10.835
You approve this?

33:10.841 --> 33:12.559
We can't block her from visitors.

33:12.565 --> 33:15.685
Okay, well say she's an infection
risk, or she's under investigation.

33:15.692 --> 33:17.106
Anything, just find a loophole.

33:17.112 --> 33:19.927
If we obstruct her rights, her legal
team will be all over us, you know that.

33:19.932 --> 33:22.958
And right now, you are in no
position to tell me how to do my job.

33:26.729 --> 33:28.534
They just said that she was a druggie.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.273
That's all?

33:30.279 --> 33:31.479
Yeah.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.419
She had me...

33:33.758 --> 33:35.680
got on it pretty hard and OD'd.

33:36.303 --> 33:39.116
- And they took me away from her.
- That is just...

33:41.008 --> 33:42.211
Not true.

33:42.914 --> 33:44.376
Your mother...

33:44.985 --> 33:47.810
was under my watch for
her whole pregnancy,

33:47.816 --> 33:49.962
and she was not a druggie. She...

33:51.310 --> 33:53.787
Jianna was so excited about you.

33:54.210 --> 33:56.572
She did everything that
she could t... to...

33:56.843 --> 33:58.362
to get her life in order.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.153
She improved her health,

34:00.159 --> 34:03.681
studied. She wanted to give you
both the best possible chance.

34:03.964 --> 34:06.604
- But then they snatched you away.
- Why?

34:07.433 --> 34:11.188
You know, in those days, a woman
in prison giving birth is...

34:13.592 --> 34:15.360
But it wasn't like that at all.

34:17.565 --> 34:19.504
Your mother adored you.

34:20.387 --> 34:22.973
It was only when you were
taken that she started to...

34:23.322 --> 34:24.744
fall apart.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.493
Why didn't you stop 'em?

34:27.467 --> 34:29.545
- You worked for 'em.
- Believe me, I tried.

34:29.552 --> 34:31.178
If you cared for her
so much, why didn't you

34:31.183 --> 34:33.013
- find me?
- Yes, I failed. I failed.

34:33.018 --> 34:37.324
I failed Jianna. I failed you.
In the worst possible way.

34:37.837 --> 34:41.062
I promised your mother
that I would find you.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.958
And that I would protect you.

34:44.321 --> 34:46.168
And all I want now is to...

34:47.532 --> 34:49.438
Is to keep that promise.

35:00.530 --> 35:01.730
Christ!

35:04.514 --> 35:07.036
- Let me try Proctor just once.
- No.

35:07.042 --> 35:08.565
She was tight with Ferguson,

35:08.571 --> 35:10.321
- she's got to know what was going on.
- No.

35:10.327 --> 35:12.338
- I can get through to her.
- Will!

35:14.515 --> 35:15.715
Enough.

35:17.444 --> 35:19.399
And consider this an official warning.

35:29.407 --> 35:30.607
Smith!

35:30.902 --> 35:32.441
Great to see you back on your feet.

35:32.447 --> 35:33.759
- Thanks
- Look, I need

35:33.765 --> 35:35.414
- a statement to nail Ferguson.
- No, no,

35:35.420 --> 35:37.565
I already gave you guys a
statement and look what happened.

35:37.570 --> 35:38.851
- She tried to kill me.
- Okay,

35:38.857 --> 35:40.418
would you put that in a statement?

35:40.424 --> 35:41.624
What's the point?

35:41.759 --> 35:43.347
Huh? She'll deny it.

35:43.736 --> 35:46.197
A-and she's smart enough to
prove th-that I can't remember.

35:46.203 --> 35:47.403
Okay, look...

35:47.619 --> 35:50.884
Ferguson is still making plans,
okay. She's meeting contacts.

35:51.135 --> 35:52.556
- What contacts?
- A kid.

35:52.562 --> 35:54.187
Shayne Butler, she's in with him now.

35:54.193 --> 35:56.033
- Who the fuck's Shayne Butler?
- Jianna's son.

36:03.587 --> 36:05.738
Oh... yes!

36:05.744 --> 36:07.631
Hey, come on. Let's take a walk.

36:07.986 --> 36:09.599
- Mm-hm.
- It's fine.

36:09.605 --> 36:11.499
You wanna make it up to
me, now's your chance.

36:11.505 --> 36:12.905
Shayne Butler.

36:13.233 --> 36:15.513
- What do ya know about him?
- Nothing, who is he?

36:15.519 --> 36:16.753
Well, your new mate Ferguson's

36:16.759 --> 36:18.148
- latest hench.
- She's not my fuckin' mate!

36:18.153 --> 36:21.479
Okay, just tell me, did she say anything
about a kid called Shayne Butler?

36:21.485 --> 36:23.233
No, never.

36:23.714 --> 36:26.244
She's never said anything to
you about any of her other plans?

36:27.993 --> 36:29.455
You say you wanna protect the women,

36:29.461 --> 36:31.533
well put you money where
your mouth is. Go on.

36:34.546 --> 36:37.267
There's something she wanted
us to do for her on the outside.

36:37.765 --> 36:40.505
- Yeah?
- Before her court case.

36:41.457 --> 36:42.657
What?

36:45.199 --> 36:47.496
_

36:47.637 --> 36:50.838
He's 17 and he's been in juvie,
so he should be in the system.

36:50.843 --> 36:52.889
- And what's his last name?
- Butler.

36:52.895 --> 36:54.451
Now, according to Kaz,

36:54.457 --> 36:56.292
Ferguson wanted someone on the outside

36:56.298 --> 36:59.462
to take out Nils Jesper before he
could testify against her in court.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.085
Yeah, but he's in Walford isn't he,

37:01.090 --> 37:02.290
- Jesper?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:02.296 --> 37:03.791
But this kid might have some contacts

37:03.796 --> 37:05.358
at Walford from being in juvie.

37:05.364 --> 37:08.121
So we need to stay on top of
anything that connects him to Jesper.

37:08.301 --> 37:09.744
All right, I'll check it out.

37:10.274 --> 37:11.833
- And, Red...
- Yeah?

37:11.839 --> 37:13.754
you've got a bit of
bad-arse in your voice again.

37:13.759 --> 37:15.444
It's hot, I like it.

37:17.675 --> 37:19.399
- You're too fuckin' short!
- You're too busy talkin'...

37:19.404 --> 37:20.604
Fuck! You go on.

37:20.610 --> 37:21.827
Proctor, stop!

37:22.058 --> 37:23.471
I said "Stop"!

37:26.217 --> 37:28.103
I'm taking a lot of shit
for what I did for you.

37:28.109 --> 37:30.813
- You didn't do anything for me!
- I played you that recording, okay?

37:30.818 --> 37:32.961
I put myself on the line,
so you need to start talking.

37:32.966 --> 37:34.811
You need to tell me exactly
what happened in that kitchen.

37:34.816 --> 37:36.145
- I have not idea.
- That's...

37:36.151 --> 37:37.595
that's bullshit and we both not it.

37:37.601 --> 37:38.889
- You owe me!
- I don't owe you a

37:38.897 --> 37:40.471
fuckin' thing, you prick!

37:42.624 --> 37:44.358
Oh, fuck!

37:45.013 --> 37:46.224
Fucking...!

37:47.124 --> 37:48.324
Fuck!

37:48.437 --> 37:50.256
I'm this close to losing my job.

37:50.262 --> 37:52.179
- Not my problem.
- I did that out of good faith,

37:52.184 --> 37:53.882
- so you'd know what Ferguson did.
- Bullshit!

37:53.887 --> 37:57.744
Look, all I'm trying to do is put
away the person that shopped you!

37:57.750 --> 37:59.046
Why won't you let me do that?

37:59.052 --> 38:00.438
She put you and your girls away!

38:07.492 --> 38:08.692
Wait!

38:08.698 --> 38:09.898
This is our chance!

38:09.904 --> 38:11.239
Come on, let's fuckin' finish it!

38:11.245 --> 38:13.065
- Make the bastard pay!
- No!

38:16.179 --> 38:17.953
I got a better idea.

38:22.622 --> 38:24.249
Wake up!

38:25.395 --> 38:27.028
_

38:27.034 --> 38:28.344
Mr. Jackson.

38:30.277 --> 38:31.477
Wake up.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.981
This is Sierra 5 to Sierra 3.

38:37.293 --> 38:38.493
Come in Sierra 3.

38:51.452 --> 38:52.652
Humiliated?

38:54.150 --> 38:57.410
I don't wanna be doing
this, but you and I...

38:57.830 --> 39:00.842
have 12 years together, Mr. Jackson.

39:01.092 --> 39:02.932
Assuming you keep your job that long.

39:03.446 --> 39:04.897
So, here's the deal...

39:10.177 --> 39:13.271
You ever lay a hand on me...

39:13.732 --> 39:15.574
or any of the other girls...

39:16.006 --> 39:17.449
ever again...

39:18.877 --> 39:20.284
this goes online.

39:21.645 --> 39:23.326
And your career will be over.

39:28.026 --> 39:29.744
Do you understand me?

39:31.648 --> 39:33.577
Sierra 3 to Sierra 5, do you copy?

39:33.583 --> 39:35.010
- Over.
- Kaz! Come on.

39:40.226 --> 39:41.426
Fuck!

39:42.178 --> 39:44.487
This is Sierra 5 to Sierra 3.

39:46.796 --> 39:48.585
Come in Sierra 3.

39:51.663 --> 39:53.439
Come in Sierra 3.

39:57.078 --> 39:58.737
Will, you in here?!

39:58.743 --> 40:01.282
Hey, come here mate!

40:03.633 --> 40:04.900
Oh, shit!

40:06.213 --> 40:07.663
Jesus! You okay?

40:07.669 --> 40:09.418
Get these off me, please!

40:11.394 --> 40:12.594
Argh!

40:12.754 --> 40:14.395
Oh, fuck!

40:18.074 --> 40:20.679
Sierra 2 to Sierra 5, any answer yet?

40:21.007 --> 40:23.661
Ah, come in Sierra 2.
I'm with Mr. Jackson now.

40:26.192 --> 40:28.263
Ah, he's actually a
bit crook at the minute.

40:28.269 --> 40:29.788
Looking like he might need to head home

40:29.793 --> 40:31.496
and be covered for
the rest of his shift.

40:31.502 --> 40:32.939
Copy that Sierra 5.

40:35.843 --> 40:37.685
I made a bad call, okay.

40:37.691 --> 40:38.985
I fucked up.

40:39.161 --> 40:40.746
Vera can't know about this.

40:42.737 --> 40:43.937
Copy that.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.424
Thanks, Jake.

40:46.339 --> 40:48.464
Attention compound. Attention compound.

40:48.470 --> 40:50.475
H Block are now called to dinner

40:50.480 --> 40:52.587
- Time to go, Jenkins. Dinner.
- Oh, no.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.000
Will I see you tomorrow?

40:55.006 --> 40:56.220
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

40:56.225 --> 40:57.704
- Of course.
- Attention compound. Attention

40:57.709 --> 40:59.503

41:00.990 --> 41:03.138
- Mm.

41:03.144 --> 41:04.380
- It's okay.
- No...

41:04.386 --> 41:05.718
Attention compound. Attention compound.

41:05.723 --> 41:07.277
- D Block are now called to dinner.
- It's not that I don't want you to have

41:07.282 --> 41:10.560
your tits back, Maxie,
'cause I do. Right, but...

41:10.683 --> 41:13.222
If anyone's gonna make it
happen, I wish it was me.

41:14.034 --> 41:15.417
You know, but I can't.

41:16.253 --> 41:18.456
But you promised me some of yours.

41:18.462 --> 41:20.311
Oh, yeah, that's right.

41:20.318 --> 41:22.805
- Hmm. Hm? Mm.
- Hey?

41:22.811 --> 41:25.875
Do you remember once you
offered me something else?

41:26.404 --> 41:29.136
- Was it a food thing or somethin'?
- No.

41:30.098 --> 41:31.600
Having a baby?

41:31.818 --> 41:33.115
Oh, yeah.

41:34.039 --> 41:35.239
Mm.

41:41.987 --> 41:44.601
You... you... you...
you... you mean, you'd...

41:44.602 --> 41:46.216
- I've been thinking...
- Oh!

41:46.222 --> 41:48.068
- Nah, nah...
- but Booms, Booms, hey,

41:48.074 --> 41:49.822
- chances are slim but let's
- Oh!

41:49.828 --> 41:51.630
just say we can get to my sperm

41:51.636 --> 41:54.315
- deposit, maybe it's worth a shot?
- Maxie! No!

41:54.574 --> 41:56.052
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

41:56.058 --> 41:58.055
Yeah? Fuck, I love you!

41:58.061 --> 41:59.362
Oh, fuck I love you, I love

41:59.368 --> 42:00.793
- you so... mwah!
- All right.

42:00.799 --> 42:02.378
Any time you're ready, Jenkins.

42:02.384 --> 42:05.065
Yeah! I'm ready, I'm ready!

42:05.071 --> 42:06.783
Oh, I'm ready, I'm ready.

42:06.789 --> 42:08.257
I'm ready, I'm ready.

42:08.263 --> 42:10.307
Oh, fuck! Oh!

42:20.940 --> 42:23.017
You know your mate, Helen,

42:23.119 --> 42:25.818
did the cops know that she
suffered with depression?

42:26.614 --> 42:27.905
Why do you ask?

42:27.986 --> 42:30.677
Well, I just thought if they
knew, they'd get off your back.

42:31.942 --> 42:33.851
Oh, it's all right, Sonia.

42:34.213 --> 42:35.413
What's all right?

42:35.419 --> 42:38.430
Oh, I'm cool about Maxie's tits now, eh?

42:38.436 --> 42:41.709
Yeah, you can get Maxie the tits,
'cause I'm gonna give us a bub.

42:42.139 --> 42:45.179
- What?
- Yeah, I-I can have Maxie's sperms,

42:45.185 --> 42:48.040
- to make a baby.
- Oh, my God, wow!

42:48.046 --> 42:50.333
- I know!
- Boomer...

42:50.339 --> 42:53.057
- I know, I know.
- I don't know what to say?!

42:53.062 --> 42:57.475
- Hey? Oh, wow.
- Wow, I didn't understand any of that.

42:57.481 --> 43:00.005
Oh God, no. It's bloody complicated.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.884
Don't worry about it, she
just got a little bit jealous

43:01.889 --> 43:05.073
'cause she didn't want you, you
know, gettin' too close to Maxine.

43:05.079 --> 43:06.416
And to you.

43:06.855 --> 43:08.359
Maybe, yeah.

43:08.931 --> 43:11.341
You do defend me a lot, Liz.

43:11.743 --> 43:15.258
W-well, it's just 'cause I know how
rough it is being a newbie in here.

43:15.264 --> 43:17.208
And you ask a lot of questions.

43:18.686 --> 43:20.780
- Do I?
- You know you do.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.691
Well, you're just...

43:25.673 --> 43:27.278
you are so different,

43:27.284 --> 43:29.380
you know, to everyone
else in here, and...

43:29.581 --> 43:32.885
well, I didn't think I'd ever be
in prison with someone so, kind of,

43:33.065 --> 43:34.760
you know, fancy.

43:35.823 --> 43:37.023
Er,

43:37.575 --> 43:41.043
and... and you... you've been in the
paper and stuff, so I don't know...

43:42.246 --> 43:44.249
maybe I'm a little
bit star-struck by ya?

43:47.732 --> 43:49.211
It's all right.

43:52.524 --> 43:53.857
I get that a lot.

43:53.863 --> 43:55.063
Oh.

44:03.192 --> 44:06.007
Ferguson made a follow-up
call to him about 4:00 P.M..

44:06.013 --> 44:07.428
- Mm-hm.
- I think she was arranging

44:07.434 --> 44:09.225
a second meeting. I can't be sure.

44:09.231 --> 44:11.348
Right, I'll check first
thing in the morning.

44:14.106 --> 44:16.563
Um... ah, Mr. Stewart...

44:18.974 --> 44:20.967
about some of her...

44:22.311 --> 44:24.074
- other insinuations...
- Hey.

44:24.185 --> 44:26.392
- I don't believe anything she says.
- For the record,

44:26.576 --> 44:28.803
it is true that I have hepatitis C.

44:31.594 --> 44:34.297
And for the record,
doesn't matter to me.

44:43.473 --> 44:44.673
I...

44:44.894 --> 44:46.212
I didn't think...

44:47.106 --> 44:48.306
No.

44:51.017 --> 44:52.217
Not here.

44:54.879 --> 44:56.273
How far to yours?

45:05.715 --> 45:06.915
Hey.

45:08.696 --> 45:10.685
Oh, I'm so sorry, I...

45:10.789 --> 45:12.880
I haven't... I haven't been to see you.

45:15.594 --> 45:17.282
You can come closer.

45:20.350 --> 45:21.550
How are you?

45:21.766 --> 45:22.966
I'm still here.

45:23.110 --> 45:24.427
I'm still me.

45:24.610 --> 45:26.015
Still beautiful.

45:28.304 --> 45:30.407
I brought you some flowers.

45:31.202 --> 45:35.025
Oh, Bea... it's beautiful.

45:35.286 --> 45:36.786
Sit down.

45:38.599 --> 45:41.319
So, I heard a rumour that...

45:41.958 --> 45:44.387
you're giving your sperm to Boomer?

45:45.489 --> 45:46.689
Yeah.

45:47.364 --> 45:48.989
I always wanted to have a kid.

45:48.995 --> 45:50.428
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:50.708 --> 45:52.809
And Boomer's got a great heart.

45:54.294 --> 45:56.450
And if the treatment doesn't work out...

45:56.456 --> 45:58.271
It's gonna work out, Maxine.

46:01.616 --> 46:02.905
Anyway, I...

46:03.092 --> 46:04.569
hear you haven't had an easy

46:04.575 --> 46:06.061
- time lately.
- Oh!

46:06.067 --> 46:07.442
Ferguson?!

46:07.973 --> 46:09.173
Yeah.

46:09.179 --> 46:10.965
And the rest of Kaz's crew, too.

46:13.313 --> 46:15.913
- But not Allie?
- Mm.

46:18.770 --> 46:21.451
Oh, hon. You really
fell for her, didn't you?

46:26.043 --> 46:27.283
Yeah.

46:31.371 --> 46:33.305
Do you know I really though that we...

46:37.127 --> 46:38.828
Fuck, she played me all the way.

46:40.330 --> 46:41.626
Bea...

46:42.142 --> 46:44.749
come on. I saw you both.

46:45.509 --> 46:48.423
Trust me, honey, she
wasn't playing anyone.

47:00.117 --> 47:02.491
Relax, I just want a word with Allie.

47:03.219 --> 47:04.419
Not here.

47:04.425 --> 47:05.625
Where is she?

47:06.101 --> 47:07.452
Why don't you tell me?

47:09.014 --> 47:10.936
Well, she's all yours now.

47:51.308 --> 47:54.324
_

47:55.136 --> 47:56.987
You and me, whatever it was,

47:57.517 --> 47:58.781
it's done.

47:59.993 --> 48:01.415
You're a mess.

48:01.421 --> 48:03.733
She was fine until you came along.

48:03.739 --> 48:05.595
Allie!

48:08.126 --> 48:09.559
I love you.

48:12.244 --> 48:13.619
That's a shame.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.130
_

48:15.136 --> 48:17.750
You know as well as I do
that Ferguson will not stop.

48:17.756 --> 48:19.334
I've been warned about you, Joan.

48:19.340 --> 48:21.631
Don't be too sure of
anything anyone tells you.

48:21.910 --> 48:23.605
Perhaps you could advise me.

48:23.611 --> 48:25.118
Why would I do that?

48:25.124 --> 48:26.324
It might be fun.

48:28.726 --> 48:31.246
- The new season of Wentworth.
- _

48:31.252 --> 48:34.824
08:30 P.M. next Tuesday on SoHo.
