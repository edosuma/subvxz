10:00.933 --> 10:02.226
- You don't.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.353
And you don't let anybody

10:04.437 --> 10:04.770
know you have them.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.030
- We have to
get the <i>Hexoren</i> back ASAP.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.114
- How?
Is there a spell I can cast?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.867
- No, spells don't work
on the <i>Hexoren.</i>

10:17.950 --> 10:20.077
Ironically, you'll just have to
do it the old-fashioned way.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.121
You steal it back.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.581
- Oh!
Right.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.791
I wasn't sure if "old-fashioned"

10:25.875 --> 10:26.667
meant the same to you
as it does to me

10:26.751 --> 10:29.003
since you're so much older.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.921
I mean, not that much older,

10:31.005 --> 10:32.840
just, like,
another generation older.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.801
So our references
might not be the same and--

10:35.885 --> 10:37.136
I'll shut up now

10:37.219 --> 10:38.721
so you can tell me
how to steal the <i>Hexoren back.</i>

10:41.515 --> 10:42.767
- Andi, Andi,
wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:42.850 --> 10:44.143
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

10:44.226 --> 10:46.979
Do you know where Emma is?
I need to apologize to her.

10:47.063 --> 10:47.855
- No.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.815
And don't use those puppy eyes.

10:49.899 --> 10:50.316
They don't work on me.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.567
- Please?

10:51.650 --> 10:54.028
- [scoffs]
They don't...

10:54.862 --> 10:56.530
All right.
She's--

10:56.614 --> 10:58.991
- Get lost, tool girl.

10:59.075 --> 10:59.950
- Tools are cool.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.827
So that's not an insult.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.914
- I'm having a private
conversation with my boyfriend.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.374
Capisce?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.500
Good.
- Wait. Your boyfriend?

11:07.583 --> 11:10.044
You guys got back together?

11:10.127 --> 11:11.504
- Yep, spread the word...

11:11.587 --> 11:13.714
to everyone.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.425
- Hurry up!

11:16.509 --> 11:17.510
We have to get home
and figure out

11:17.593 --> 11:18.386
how to steal back
the you-know-what.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.012
- Why are you so anxious?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.723
- Look, something was different
about Maddie today.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.100
She seemed more...

11:24.183 --> 11:25.476
powerful.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.560
- And Daniel?

11:26.644 --> 11:29.855
Was he still being all
not Daniel-ish?

11:29.939 --> 11:33.234
- Can we not worry about Daniel
right now?

11:34.527 --> 11:34.902
- Or ever.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.781
- Oh, hey, guys.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.534
- Don't "hey, guys" us
like we're your friends.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.285
- We were just leaving.
[laughs nervously]

11:43.369 --> 11:44.787
- Not yet.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.498
I want to show you
what I just learned.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.041
Sophie, out.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.376
- But I want to see.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.128
- They've got
chocolate-covered asparagus

11:52.211 --> 11:53.462
in the cafeteria today.

11:53.546 --> 11:53.712
- Ooh!

11:56.382 --> 11:58.426
- So what was it
that you wanted to show us?

11:58.509 --> 12:03.139
- Just a little trick I learned.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.640
- Trick?

12:04.723 --> 12:06.308
<i>[exciting music]</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:08.978
You do magic too?

12:09.061 --> 12:12.481

so much I frown,

12:12.565 --> 12:14.692
turn this classroom upside down.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.155

12:31.292 --> 12:33.586
- What did you do?

12:33.669 --> 12:36.630
- I taught them
not to mess with me.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.340
Now, let's go home
and find out what else

12:38.424 --> 12:41.051
this better,
meaner Maddie can do.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.679
Hmm.
[giggles]

12:43.762 --> 12:44.930
- How are we gonna get down
from here?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.102
- I never thought I'd say this,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.313
but this is
beyond my magic expertise.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.064
- You think?

can explode when that--

everything later

13:12.416 --> 13:15.711

13:19.840 --> 13:21.800
- This is a zombie apocalypse?

13:21.884 --> 13:24.595
- It was a hypothetical!

13:24.678 --> 13:27.640
- Tony, I know this
is totally bizarre and freaky,

13:27.723 --> 13:31.352

I'll explain everything.

kind of used to this.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.232
This is kind of cool.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.984
It's like I'm in some,
like, awesome music video.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.446
- You mean you know
how this happened?

13:43.531 --> 13:47.910
- Yes, and I think
I know how to fix this.

happened to me.

- [laughs]

14:02.675 --> 14:03.884
Nothing compared
to what happened to me.

- To you?
You mean what happened to me.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.596

- Want to bet?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.098
- Definitely.
Double or nothing.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.475
- You can't go double or nothing
when you haven't even bet once.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.435
- Well,
that's how confident I am.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.896
- I wouldn't be so sure
about this, Diego.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.273
- Oh, come on!

14:17.356 --> 14:19.775
What could possibly be weirder
than me freezing you

14:19.858 --> 14:21.819
into a giant block of ice?

14:21.902 --> 14:22.653
- This.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.655
According to Miss Information,

14:24.738 --> 14:27.700
Daniel got back with Maddie.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.034
- You got back together
with Maddie?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.745
- You froze him into
a giant block of ice?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.831
- [groans]
Too close to call.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.750
- I think it stopped.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.044
- No, no, don't let go.

14:39.128 --> 14:39.795
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

14:39.878 --> 14:42.006
Cast a spell to fix this.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.966
- Spell?
What do you mean a spell?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.176
- I'm afraid
to make it worse.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.303
You know the whole

14:47.386 --> 14:49.805
monkey/rabbit/turtle/monkey
thing.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.307
- What are you two
talking about?

14:51.390 --> 14:52.933
- If and when
we get out of here,

14:53.017 --> 14:54.435
Maddie is so
going to get it.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.979
- Maddie?

14:57.062 --> 14:57.855
What does Maddie
have to do with this?

14:57.938 --> 14:59.148
- I'll explain everything later.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.484
Right now, we have to try
to crawl to the door.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.819
Maddie's spell said "Classroom,"

15:03.902 --> 15:06.989
so I'm figuring
the rest of the school

15:07.072 --> 15:09.658
is not upside down.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.995
- Did Daniel call?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.788
- No, but you did get
an alert that you're 900 texts

15:14.872 --> 15:17.666
over your monthly
text allowance.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.084
- That's all?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.587
- Maddie, at the risk of you
throwing something at my head,

15:21.670 --> 15:23.005
I need to tell you.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.965
You cannot leave the classroom
upside down.

15:25.049 --> 15:25.507
Your mother clearly said...

15:25.591 --> 15:27.843
- "Maddie Winky,

15:27.926 --> 15:30.512
"you can't let anybody know
about your powers.

Keeping magic secret
is paramount to our survival."

15:34.183 --> 15:35.851
- Okay, fine.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.853
I've had my fun
with that anyway.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.481
It's time
to try something new.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.361
- He must be a descendent
of the last Kanay family.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.613
- Wow, so you've
never seen one before?

15:47.696 --> 15:50.449
- No. I wonder what kind
of frog a Kanay would make.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.701
- Are you sure you've bewitched
all those frogs' parents

15:52.785 --> 15:54.495
so they're not wondering
where their kids are?

15:54.578 --> 15:55.704
- Oh, of course.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.498
I have a spreadsheet
that I use to keep track.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.749
- So what now?

15:58.832 --> 16:01.043
- Well, we can't have
a Kanay running around

16:01.126 --> 16:01.835
during the eclipse.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.879
They're so unpredictable

16:03.962 --> 16:06.965
with their "honor"
and "loyalty."

16:07.049 --> 16:09.760
Bring him to me
after school tomorrow.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.470
- You are not
gonna hurt him, are you?

16:11.553 --> 16:14.890
- Of course not.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.267
We'll just have a nice chat,
and, well,

16:17.351 --> 16:19.103
if he gets difficult,
there's always room

16:19.186 --> 16:22.898

in my little aquarium.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.578
- And it's the second time
he's seen a spell.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.912
- Second time.
- Andi!

19:23.996 --> 19:24.955
- Sorry, I was just trying
to be your hype man.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.665
Thought it might
help your cause.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.749
- Second time
he's seen a spell?

19:27.833 --> 19:28.750
- I broke his vase
at the magic show,

19:28.834 --> 19:31.003
and I had to fix it,

19:31.086 --> 19:33.422
but I pretended
it was just a magic trick.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.632
- Well, with Tony, there's
only one thing to do now.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.925
- What's that?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.594
- You're just gonna
have to wipe his memory.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.387
- What?
- Cool!

19:40.470 --> 19:41.805
- No, not cool.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.931
- Right, right.
Not cool.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.350
[whispers] So cool.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.852
- It's a tricky spell,
and without the <i>Hexoren,</i>

19:46.935 --> 19:48.520
it's even more difficult.

19:48.604 --> 19:52.941
It's possible
he could...forget everything.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.234
- What?

19:54.318 --> 19:57.112
No, I'm sorry, Lily,
but I can't do that--

19:57.195 --> 19:58.614
Not to my friends,
not to anyone.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.117
I'm sure if I just talk to Tony,
he'll keep the secret.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.037
- You know, I'm so happy
you're so nice as a person,

20:05.120 --> 20:06.788
but sometimes you're
a little too nice as a witch.

20:06.872 --> 20:11.501
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

20:15.714 --> 20:18.300
- Mom, what are you doing
in my room?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.760
- Going through your stuff.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.762
- What?
Why?

20:21.845 --> 20:25.223
- No reason, except for...

20:28.727 --> 20:30.646
This!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.153
[clunk]
- Ow!

20:38.236 --> 20:39.321
- [gasps]

20:39.404 --> 20:42.407
What are you doing?

20:42.491 --> 20:43.784
- You wouldn't answer my calls,

20:43.867 --> 20:45.160
and your dad keeps
closing the door on me, so I...

20:45.243 --> 20:46.119
- You decided
to go all stalker on me

20:46.203 --> 20:48.664
and climb through my window?

20:48.747 --> 20:49.456
- Please, just hear me out.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.503
I don't know
what came over me this week.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.964
It's like I was possessed
or something.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.007
- Okay, go on.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.301
- But I wanted
to tell you that...

21:03.804 --> 21:05.847
I like you.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.516
- You do?

21:07.599 --> 21:08.850
- Yes.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.019
You're quirky,
you're a little bit cheesy,

21:11.103 --> 21:11.812
and you definitely
talk a lot.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.272
- Gee, thanks.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.192
- No, no, I meant that
as a compliment,

21:17.275 --> 21:18.694
but lately I can't
say anything right.

21:18.777 --> 21:23.490
Like yesterday, I kept saying
the opposite of what I meant.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.368
- Oh.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.828
Oh!

21:27.911 --> 21:30.706
- It's like I was under
a spell or something.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.250
- What?
No, definitely not mine.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.752
I mean, I can't cast spells.
That's totally preposterous.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.879
- See what I mean?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.089
You're funny,

21:39.172 --> 21:41.383
you're strange,
and you're unpredictable,

21:41.466 --> 21:45.846
and now that I think
I can say what I mean,

21:45.929 --> 21:47.097
I wanted to tell you that...

21:49.683 --> 21:52.060
I think about you all the time,
and I want to go out with you.

21:52.144 --> 21:56.815
- Danny, me too!
Really.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.901
But if we're going to go out,
I have to tell you the truth.
