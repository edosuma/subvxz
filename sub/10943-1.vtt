00:00.329 --> 00:01.329
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:01.388 --> 00:02.989
Um, he ordered
the Saskatoon Berry.

00:03.056 --> 00:04.723
Most of our customers
prefer apple.

00:04.791 --> 00:05.724
The boy, Shane.

00:05.792 --> 00:06.725
Yeah.

00:06.793 --> 00:08.361
He's my son.

00:08.428 --> 00:10.262
What the hell am I gonna do?

00:10.330 --> 00:11.597
You don't repeat the past.

00:11.664 --> 00:13.466
I just need you to know
I'm behind Ashley,

00:13.533 --> 00:14.733
all the way.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.102
In fact,
I'm moving to BC with her.

00:16.169 --> 00:17.335
You're going with her?

00:17.403 --> 00:18.803
Okay...

00:18.871 --> 00:20.205
- Get 'er done.
- Absolutely.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.541
Shane?!

00:23.609 --> 00:24.675
Miranda?!

00:27.279 --> 00:28.213
What're you doing here?

00:28.280 --> 00:29.481
She's in full out labour.

00:29.548 --> 00:30.548
We never would've made it
to the hospital.

00:30.616 --> 00:32.317
It's a girl, Lou.
It's...

00:32.384 --> 00:34.118
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

02:45.908 --> 02:47.309
Hi.
Hello.

02:48.711 --> 02:49.645
Renard Perez.

02:49.712 --> 02:50.912
Amy Fleming.

02:50.980 --> 02:53.549
That was absolutely amazing.

02:53.617 --> 02:55.384
I've never seen anything
like it.

02:55.452 --> 02:56.585
What kind of horses
are they?

02:56.653 --> 02:57.818
Andalusians.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.255
Mercutio and Laertes.

03:00.322 --> 03:01.989
They're absolutely
beautiful.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.191
And talented,

03:03.259 --> 03:04.792
but I shouldn't say that
out loud.

03:04.860 --> 03:06.261
They're a couple of divas;

03:06.328 --> 03:08.663
That's what happens
when you put them on a stage.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.750
- For...
- Ah,

03:09.830 --> 03:11.499
"Dark Horse".
It's an equestrian show.

03:11.567 --> 03:12.900
We're getting ready
to open up in Calgary.

03:12.968 --> 03:14.100
I've heard about it.

03:14.169 --> 03:15.135
You're the director,
aren't you?

03:15.203 --> 03:17.504
Director?
That's a bit theatrical.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.772
No,
I'm just a horse trainer.

03:18.839 --> 03:20.106
That's all.

03:20.175 --> 03:21.775
Actually, they train me
more than I train them.

03:21.842 --> 03:23.477
I have a lot to learn,

03:23.545 --> 03:25.145
this is the best place
to do it.

03:25.213 --> 03:26.180
Wow...

03:26.247 --> 03:27.614
So do you come out here
a lot?

03:27.682 --> 03:29.082
I'm gonna be trapped
in the city.

03:29.150 --> 03:31.517
But for now,
I bring my tent out here,

03:31.585 --> 03:33.986
camp with the horses
and we play together.

03:34.054 --> 03:35.988
Just don't
tell them it's a rehearsal

03:36.056 --> 03:37.523
I won't.

03:37.591 --> 03:38.991
Well, I'll...
I'll leave you to it.

03:39.059 --> 03:40.826
No, no...
Take a seat.

03:40.894 --> 03:42.195
Front row.

03:42.262 --> 03:43.896
They love an audience.

03:43.963 --> 03:45.263

06:23.680 --> 06:25.113
it's not like I gave up on it.

06:25.181 --> 06:26.448
I've been looking for 'em
for months.

06:26.515 --> 06:28.416
Is that so?

06:28.484 --> 06:29.851
Yeah, that's so.

06:29.918 --> 06:31.453
Ever since the dude ranch.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.987
I haven't had any luck.

06:33.055 --> 06:34.456
Well, maybe you're not looking
hard enough.

06:34.523 --> 06:35.923
Oh, come on...

06:35.991 --> 06:37.859
Fort St. John
is not that big a place.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.293
No, it's not that big a place.

06:39.362 --> 06:41.162
So obviously Miranda
doesn't wanna be found.

06:41.230 --> 06:43.397
What about Shane?
What do you think he wants?

06:45.734 --> 06:46.933
H'yah!

07:04.418 --> 07:06.085
So, the spring
fling is coming up

07:06.152 --> 07:07.854
and I don't have a date.

07:07.921 --> 07:09.088
Why do you need a date?

07:09.155 --> 07:10.189
Just go alone.

07:10.257 --> 07:11.957
Alone?
Are you kidding me?

07:12.025 --> 07:14.393
Do you know what that would do
to my class cred?

07:14.427 --> 07:15.960
Social suicide.

07:16.028 --> 07:17.195
What if Jake saw me?

07:17.263 --> 07:18.597
Uh, Mallory...

07:18.664 --> 07:20.799
Might as well get "loser"
tattooed on my forehead.

07:23.536 --> 07:24.603
Hi.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.805
Hi.

07:26.873 --> 07:28.172
Hey, Jake.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.973
Hey.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.042
I guess you heard.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.176
Heard what?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.212
Uh, Jamie and I broke up.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.115
Oh, sorry,
hadn't heard.

07:38.182 --> 07:40.518
Well, yes, sort of,
but not for sure.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.420
So, what's happening?

07:42.487 --> 07:43.788
Lot of things.
Always.

07:43.855 --> 07:46.589
I'm just
one big happening.

07:46.657 --> 07:48.024
So, the dance is coming up.

07:48.091 --> 07:50.192
Really? Hadn't really
thought much about it.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.895
Are you going?

07:51.962 --> 07:53.596
Look, Jake,

07:53.664 --> 07:55.932
before things get weird,
I just want to say

07:56.000 --> 07:57.600
that I'm not interested
in being asked out

07:57.668 --> 07:59.101
by someone
who's on the rebound,

07:59.169 --> 08:01.837
so just forget about it,
okay?

08:01.905 --> 08:03.004
Who said I was asking?

08:03.072 --> 08:04.072
I was wondering
if you were going,

08:04.140 --> 08:05.206
that's all.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.277
Loser.

08:15.351 --> 08:17.018
Hey, Shane!

08:17.953 --> 08:19.987
Ty Borden.
I'm Amy's... friend.

08:20.055 --> 08:21.789
Oh yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

08:21.857 --> 08:22.990
How're you doing?

08:23.058 --> 08:24.658
Good, man.
What're you doing in Hudson?

08:33.467 --> 08:35.534
Come on.

08:49.148 --> 08:52.351
Hey, Ty, you are not
gonna believe this.

08:52.418 --> 08:54.186
It just saw
the most amazing thing!

08:54.253 --> 08:55.554
There was this guy
who's--

08:55.622 --> 08:56.789
He's in a show,
a horse show in Calgary.

08:56.857 --> 08:57.623
<i>He was working
with these horses.</i>

08:57.691 --> 09:00.157
Hey.
Hey, I'm back.

09:00.225 --> 09:01.192
Shane?

09:01.259 --> 09:02.360
Where's Pal?
I wanna see her.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.696
- Is she in the barn?
- No. She's not.

09:04.763 --> 09:05.997
Where is she then?

09:06.064 --> 09:07.231
That doesn't matter.
What're you doing here?

09:07.299 --> 09:08.900
How did you get
to Hudson?

09:08.968 --> 09:10.468
On the bus.

09:10.536 --> 09:11.469
On the bus?

09:11.537 --> 09:12.871
Yeah.
Yeah, it's no big deal.

09:12.938 --> 09:13.938
Does your mom know
you're here?

09:14.006 --> 09:15.672
I already asked him that.

09:15.740 --> 09:16.707
And does she?

09:16.774 --> 09:18.509
Yeah!
No, everything's cool.

09:18.576 --> 09:20.577
<i>My mom knows.</i>

09:20.645 --> 09:21.745
Well, I'll be...

09:21.813 --> 09:23.113
Hey!
Hey, Tim!

09:24.048 --> 09:25.215
Hey.

09:25.282 --> 09:27.217
<i>Hey.
Where, where's...</i>

09:27.284 --> 09:28.552
Where's your mom?

09:28.620 --> 09:29.887
<i>ck:
Look who's here.</i>

09:29.954 --> 09:31.954
Good to see you, Shane.

09:32.022 --> 09:33.856
So? Where is your mom?

09:33.924 --> 09:36.225
<i>my:
He said she knows he is here.</i>

09:36.292 --> 09:37.426
<i>im:
Oh really?</i>

09:37.494 --> 09:40.162
Well,

09:40.230 --> 09:41.731
maybe we should
give her a call.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.432
What do you think?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.434
Huh?

09:44.502 --> 09:46.569
Might be a good idea.
Yeah, let's give her a call.

09:51.807 --> 09:53.508
Now, why would
Shane just show up here

09:53.576 --> 09:54.543
out of the blue?

09:54.610 --> 09:56.578
And did you see the look on
my dad's face when he saw him?

09:56.646 --> 09:57.879
This is just weird.

09:57.947 --> 10:00.381
Well, maybe he just misses
his horse.

10:00.449 --> 10:01.650
I know he misses being here.
I don't know...

10:01.717 --> 10:03.151
Yeah, I guess.

10:03.218 --> 10:04.217
Hey, what were you
starting to tell me

10:04.285 --> 10:05.218
when you showed up?

10:05.286 --> 10:07.421
Oh, Ty, it was incredible.

10:07.488 --> 10:09.356
<i>ng: The number you
have reached is not--</i>

10:09.424 --> 10:12.826
Okay.
The number's no longer listed.

10:12.894 --> 10:16.496
Must be a phone problem
or something.

10:16.565 --> 10:17.965
Well, it could be.

10:19.267 --> 10:20.867
Once and for all,
okay,

10:20.935 --> 10:23.102
you wanna tell me
where you and your mother live?

10:23.170 --> 10:24.403
Come on, you're gonna tell me
this right now,

10:24.471 --> 10:26.105
or there's gonna be
trouble.

10:26.173 --> 10:27.339
Moose Jaw.

10:27.407 --> 10:28.141
Moose Jaw?

10:28.209 --> 10:30.309
You took a bus from Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan,

10:30.377 --> 10:31.911
by yourself?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.046
And your mother was good
with that?

10:33.113 --> 10:34.881
Yeah.

10:34.949 --> 10:37.549
<i>ck: I don't know
that I'm buying that.</i>

10:37.617 --> 10:39.417
You call her again

10:39.485 --> 10:41.653
and you get the number right
this time.

10:41.721 --> 10:44.623
Get an address
while you're at it.

10:52.497 --> 10:54.298
Hey, mom.
It's me.

10:54.365 --> 10:57.635
<i>Mom, chill out.
I'm at Heartland.</i>

10:57.703 --> 10:58.769
On the bus.

11:00.472 --> 11:01.606
Okay, okay.

11:03.742 --> 11:05.843
She wants to talk to you.

11:05.911 --> 11:07.811
Miranda.

11:07.878 --> 11:09.779
Yeah.
Yeah, he's safe.

11:11.415 --> 11:12.983
Excuse me?

11:13.918 --> 11:15.351
No, I've been...

11:15.419 --> 11:16.452
I've been trying
to get a hold of you

11:16.520 --> 11:18.387
for the past five months.

11:19.323 --> 11:20.490
And you just disappear,

11:20.557 --> 11:23.392
make it impossible for me
to find you.

11:23.460 --> 11:25.127
So...

11:25.194 --> 11:26.996
Pretty dumb thing to do,

11:27.063 --> 11:29.531
<i>leaving home,
not telling your mother.</i>

11:29.599 --> 11:31.100
What's going on?

11:31.167 --> 11:33.068
Nothing's going on.
I just wanted to visit.

11:33.136 --> 11:34.202
Oh.

11:36.439 --> 11:37.940
So, what's the plan?

11:38.008 --> 11:39.341
The plan?
The plan is you stay here tonight,

11:39.408 --> 11:40.842
and your mother comes
to pick you up tomorrow.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.076
Sweet.

11:42.144 --> 11:43.645
Sweet?
No, I wouldn't say that.

11:43.712 --> 11:46.748
Not the kind of trouble
you're in.

11:47.683 --> 11:49.851
Well,
you've found 'em now.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.819
What're you gonna do
about it?

11:56.124 --> 11:59.626
Okay, so all he had to
do was raise up both his arms

11:59.694 --> 12:00.994
and his horses would rear up.

12:01.062 --> 12:03.296
But both at the same time.
It was like...

12:03.364 --> 12:05.198
Man, I wish I could do
what Renard does.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.467
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

12:07.535 --> 12:09.770
And then he'd have his horses
going around...

12:09.837 --> 12:11.771
Only not quite like this.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.005
It was a little bit better.

12:13.073 --> 12:14.339
It was more like a dance.

12:14.407 --> 12:15.841
Like he was dancing
with his horses.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.777
And it just...
No, but it looked beautiful.

12:17.844 --> 12:18.911
<i>It was so cool!</i>

12:20.047 --> 12:21.781
- What?
- Look at you.

12:21.848 --> 12:23.248
You're like a kid
on Christmas.

12:23.316 --> 12:25.685
I feel like that.

12:25.752 --> 12:26.952
I really do!

12:27.887 --> 12:30.121
Hey! So...

12:30.189 --> 12:31.422
What's up?

12:31.490 --> 12:33.524
Well, your dad made me
call my mom.

12:33.592 --> 12:34.926
And...?

12:34.994 --> 12:36.294
<i>ne:
And she's coming to get me.</i>

12:36.361 --> 12:37.829
But not until tomorrow,

12:37.897 --> 12:40.231
so at least I get to stay here
for a little while.

12:40.299 --> 12:42.233
<i>Now can I ride Pal?</i>

12:43.169 --> 12:44.835
Um... thanks.

12:47.405 --> 12:48.672
So, you guys,

12:48.740 --> 12:49.807
are you like boyfriend
and girlfriend?

12:49.874 --> 12:51.374
Good question.

12:51.442 --> 12:52.943
He told me he was your
"friend".

12:53.011 --> 12:54.745
Oh, he did, did he? Hmm.

12:54.813 --> 12:56.180
Okay to use this one?

12:56.247 --> 12:57.815
Shane, why don't you
ride Harley?

12:57.882 --> 12:59.449
He's here and already in here
and ready to be tacked up.

12:59.517 --> 13:00.616
Nah.
No, let's get Pal.

13:00.684 --> 13:02.185
I can't wait
to see her again.

13:02.252 --> 13:04.687
That's just the thing.
Um...

13:04.755 --> 13:06.189
What?

13:06.256 --> 13:07.890
It's Pal.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.759
What about her?

13:11.128 --> 13:12.195
Did she die?

13:12.262 --> 13:15.098
No. She didn't die,
but...

13:15.165 --> 13:18.633
I re-homed her--
months ago.

13:18.701 --> 13:20.068
Shane,
what was I supposed to do?

13:20.136 --> 13:25.073
She was a rescue horse.
I had to find a home for her.

13:25.141 --> 13:27.075
She was my horse.

13:28.211 --> 13:29.277
Shane...

13:31.114 --> 13:32.713
Shane, wait!

13:32.781 --> 13:35.382
Why won't you talk to me?
What's going on?

13:35.450 --> 13:37.051
I mean,
why are you here?

13:37.119 --> 13:38.418
Shane, why did you run away?

13:38.486 --> 13:40.387
You wanna know why?

13:40.455 --> 13:43.557
Because since I've left here,
we've moved like three times.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.893
I haven't been able
to make any friends.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.761
I didn't want to anyway.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.364
Why should I?
We'll just move again.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.866
I'm sorry.

13:53.934 --> 13:58.004
I can't remember being happy
since I left here.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.174
I'm so sorry, Shane.

14:09.692 --> 14:10.894
<i>ck:
So, Shane,</i>

14:10.996 --> 14:12.597
<i>we need to put you up
for the night,</i>

14:12.664 --> 14:14.098
and I have an idea.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.167
How about moving out
to the barn...?

14:17.235 --> 14:20.203
I have to study
in my loft.

14:24.008 --> 14:25.208
New idea.

14:25.275 --> 14:26.610
Lou's room.

14:26.677 --> 14:29.579
She's away at her in-laws
with Peter and the baby.

14:29.647 --> 14:31.014
She had the baby?

14:31.081 --> 14:32.115
<i>ck:
A little girl.</i>

14:32.182 --> 14:33.216
<i>ne:
Great.</i>

14:33.283 --> 14:34.950
That's great.

14:41.457 --> 14:42.957
Can I be excused?

14:43.026 --> 14:45.327
You're not gonna go
get on a bus are you?

14:45.395 --> 14:46.728
Uh... no.

14:46.795 --> 14:49.131
All right then.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.606
Well...

15:03.412 --> 15:04.945
When're you gonna talk
to him?

15:05.013 --> 15:07.515
Look, it's not that simple,
Jack.

15:07.582 --> 15:08.615
Maybe his mother's
already told him?

15:08.683 --> 15:10.017
I don't think so.

15:10.085 --> 15:11.552
He'd have said something
if she had.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.953
Well, maybe she doesn't want me
to tell him?

15:13.021 --> 15:14.787
Tim, at least find out.

15:14.855 --> 15:16.256
He's gone again tomorrow,

15:16.323 --> 15:18.458
and judging by the past
they might move again.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.792
Well, maybe that might
be the best.

15:19.860 --> 15:20.927
Best for who?

15:23.364 --> 15:24.464
You know,
maybe, for once,

15:24.532 --> 15:27.267
you should just try not
to interfere.

15:29.036 --> 15:30.602
See you in the morning.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.736
Bye.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.107
I thought he liked me.

15:35.175 --> 15:36.408
He does.

15:36.476 --> 15:39.545
Yeah.
Weird way of showing it.

15:49.521 --> 15:50.988
Hey.

15:51.056 --> 15:53.357
Hey. I think I'm gonna try
and get Pal back for Shane.

15:53.425 --> 15:55.726
I just,
I feel awful about it.

15:55.794 --> 15:58.096
Amy.
He's leaving tomorrow.

15:59.030 --> 16:00.364
He'll get over it.

16:00.432 --> 16:01.732
And if he shows up again,

16:01.800 --> 16:03.733
we'll get him
another horse, okay?

16:03.801 --> 16:04.801
Okay.

16:07.205 --> 16:09.139
You know,
Shane told me

16:09.207 --> 16:12.909
that you said
we were just friends.

16:12.977 --> 16:14.043
Yeah?

16:15.879 --> 16:19.448
Are we?
Aren't we more than that now?

16:19.516 --> 16:20.583
Well...

16:21.618 --> 16:22.718
Maybe.

16:22.785 --> 16:24.520
So what are we?

16:24.588 --> 16:27.055
When people ask,
what do I tell them?

16:27.124 --> 16:29.691
Why do we have to tell them
anything?

16:29.759 --> 16:31.494
Why does it need
a label?

16:31.561 --> 16:32.728
What does that do?

16:32.795 --> 16:34.895
No, I...
Okay, you're right.

16:34.963 --> 16:37.499
It doesn't need a label.

16:37.566 --> 16:38.766
But...

16:38.834 --> 16:41.202
If we were just friends,

16:41.270 --> 16:43.171
would I do this?

16:44.473 --> 16:45.773
Would I?
Huh? Hmm?

16:46.708 --> 16:48.075
I need to study.

16:48.144 --> 16:49.410
Oh, I'm not stopping you.

16:49.478 --> 16:50.777
- You're not stopping me?
- No, you can study.

16:50.845 --> 16:52.979
You... behave yourself.

16:53.047 --> 16:54.648
You behave yourself.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.221
<i>my:</i>

17:08.362 --> 17:09.529
Good.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.663
Come on...

17:11.298 --> 17:13.398
Come on, Spartan.
No.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.300
Get up.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.435
'Kay, turn.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.573
<i>Good.</i>

17:24.410 --> 17:25.477
Come on.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.214
Ugh! Get... just...

17:41.759 --> 17:42.826
Good boy.

17:44.429 --> 17:45.696
<i>my:
Hey.</i>

17:45.763 --> 17:47.298
Do you wanna go for a ride?

17:47.365 --> 17:48.699
Your mom's not gonna be here
for a couple of hours.

17:48.766 --> 17:50.501
No, I don't wanna ride.
I'll just wait for my mom.

17:53.104 --> 17:54.504
Is Tim around?

17:55.872 --> 17:56.939
Not yet.

18:02.613 --> 18:03.946
So, there was
this boy, Shane,

18:04.014 --> 18:05.181
he stayed at our dude ranch

18:05.249 --> 18:07.917
and he totally fell in love
with Pal,

18:07.984 --> 18:10.652
and then he left and I didn't think
he'd be visiting again.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.754
But now he's back
and he really misses his horse.

18:12.822 --> 18:14.356
And I know that's confusing--

18:14.424 --> 18:17.092
And this concerns me
because...?

18:17.159 --> 18:18.193
Because I'm really hoping

18:18.261 --> 18:19.294
that you'll giver her back
to me?

18:19.362 --> 18:20.529
Give her back?

18:20.597 --> 18:22.364
I just got her settled in.

18:22.432 --> 18:25.200
Look, I could find you
a really nice pony...

18:25.268 --> 18:27.702
I'm sure you could,
but...

18:27.770 --> 18:30.105
Well, the truth is, I've grown
rather fond of this little filly.

18:30.172 --> 18:31.606
<i>Besides,</i>

18:31.673 --> 18:33.808
<i>got a granddaughter
coming out this summer</i>

18:33.876 --> 18:35.710
and I think they'll be
a good fit.

18:35.778 --> 18:36.945
So, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

18:37.012 --> 18:39.247
but a deal's a deal.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.520
What're you doing?

18:47.588 --> 18:50.323
It rained last night.

18:50.391 --> 18:52.425
Sprung a leak.
It's a mess.

18:52.493 --> 18:54.128
My life is a mess.

18:54.195 --> 18:55.963
I still don't have a date
to the spring fling.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.731
Even Jake didn't ask me.

18:57.799 --> 19:00.266
Wait... I thought you
turned him down flat.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.201
Why would you expect h
to ask you again?

19:02.269 --> 19:05.537
Because if a guy likes a
girl he shouldn't give up so easy.

19:05.605 --> 19:08.474
If he had have asked you,
would you have said yes?

19:08.541 --> 19:11.110
No way.
Can you spell "rebound"?

19:11.178 --> 19:12.611
Why don't guys get it?

19:12.679 --> 19:13.746
Look at you and Amy.

19:13.814 --> 19:15.080
You guys are sort of
back together,

19:15.148 --> 19:16.181
but neither one of you
are saying

19:16.249 --> 19:17.682
you're actually
back together.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.950
I mean, what is that?

19:19.018 --> 19:20.919
Are you back together
or not?

19:20.987 --> 19:23.255
Look, whatever it is,
it's working, okay?

19:23.322 --> 19:25.456
It's working?
Is that all you can say?

19:25.524 --> 19:27.159
Look, Mallory,

19:27.226 --> 19:28.559
Amy and I are friends.

19:28.627 --> 19:29.761
We trust each other

19:29.829 --> 19:30.861
and we give each other
freedom,

19:30.929 --> 19:32.362
and because of that,
we're close.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.864
We're closer than
we'vevever been before.

19:33.932 --> 19:36.200
So, in that respect,
yes, we're back together.

19:36.268 --> 19:37.334
Blah, blah, blah.

19:37.402 --> 19:38.602
Tell me that
when you're old

19:38.670 --> 19:40.771
and in your mid-20's
and still alone.

19:40.839 --> 19:42.807
I am in my mid-twenties.
Almost.

19:42.874 --> 19:44.341
See, there you go.

19:44.409 --> 19:45.375
Look at you.

19:45.443 --> 19:46.843
No place to call your own,

19:46.911 --> 19:49.412
no relationship
you can put a name to.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.881
Oh, but you got freedom
and you got trust.

19:51.949 --> 19:53.683
Whoop-dee-doo!

19:57.788 --> 19:59.689
Yeah.
Where are you anyway?

19:59.756 --> 20:03.359
I mean, Shane's been waiting
for hours.

20:03.427 --> 20:06.128
Okay, well...
Yeah, he can stay another day.

20:07.397 --> 20:09.231
Okay. Listen,
I gotta ask you,

20:09.299 --> 20:11.166
have you told him?

20:11.234 --> 20:12.768
No?

20:12.836 --> 20:15.170
Uh, no. No,
I'm not gonna say a thing,

20:15.238 --> 20:16.472
not unless you want me to.

20:16.540 --> 20:18.541
So I'll just see you tomorrow,
okay?

20:18.608 --> 20:20.241
All right. Bye.

20:20.309 --> 20:23.077
<i>ne:
So? Where is she?</i>

20:23.145 --> 20:24.446
Oh, um...

20:24.513 --> 20:26.280
Well, your mother's
gonna come tomorrow.

20:26.349 --> 20:29.250
Some guy called in sick,
she's gonna cover for him.

20:29.318 --> 20:31.052
What didn't she want you
to tell me?

20:31.119 --> 20:32.587
What?
Oh, uh, nothing.

20:32.655 --> 20:34.222
Heh, nothing.

20:34.289 --> 20:36.089
Uh, I wanted to show you
something.

20:36.157 --> 20:39.760
Do you, uh...
Do you remember this?

20:39.828 --> 20:40.761
I thought you might wanna
pick up

20:40.829 --> 20:42.429
on your roping lessons.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.000
I've got no reason
to learn.

20:49.303 --> 20:51.437
Hey. Saskatoon Berry pie,
right?

20:51.505 --> 20:52.772
You stayed
at the dude ranch.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.873
Yeah. Hi.
Youe e uh...?

20:53.940 --> 20:54.874
Mallory.

20:54.941 --> 20:56.175
Hi.

20:56.243 --> 20:57.309
Tim.

20:57.378 --> 20:59.111
Hi.

21:10.923 --> 21:12.391
What is that kid doing here?

21:12.458 --> 21:15.059
Didn't he and his mom
just disappear into thin air

21:15.127 --> 21:16.361
in the middle of the night?

21:16.429 --> 21:18.162
I mean, did they even pay
their bill?

21:18.230 --> 21:19.264
What is going on?

21:19.331 --> 21:20.265
Nothing's going on.

21:20.332 --> 21:21.833
He just missed Heartland

21:21.901 --> 21:23.601
and sort of ran away from home
to come back.

21:23.668 --> 21:25.703
Really? Because Tim offered him
roping lessons.

21:25.771 --> 21:29.507
That is so not Tim.
Something's going on.

21:31.643 --> 21:32.976
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:33.044 --> 21:34.812
You know, I think something
is going on.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.813
Amy...

21:35.881 --> 21:36.881
No, listen.

21:36.948 --> 21:37.948
When Shane left
the last time,

21:38.016 --> 21:39.416
he was convinced that my dad

21:39.483 --> 21:41.384
and his mom had a thing
for each other.

21:41.452 --> 21:42.852
And then all of a sudden
Shane and Miranda

21:42.920 --> 21:44.053
just disappear?

21:44.121 --> 21:46.055
And then Janice leaves too?

21:46.123 --> 21:47.624
I mean, I don't know.
I just...

21:47.691 --> 21:49.692
It can't be a coincidence.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.160
I think you're reading
way too much into this,

21:51.228 --> 21:52.228
Sherlock.

21:52.296 --> 21:53.830
I don't think so.

21:54.765 --> 21:55.997
How did it go
with Reid Tatum?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.933
Oh, way to change
the subject.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.235
I'm just wondering.
Any luck?

22:00.303 --> 22:01.637
- No.
- No?

22:01.704 --> 22:04.440
He wasn't interested.
It was kind of frustrating.

22:04.507 --> 22:05.741
Mm.

22:05.809 --> 22:07.008
How's it going
with this guy then?

22:07.076 --> 22:08.343
<i>my:
Even more frustrating.</i>

22:08.411 --> 22:10.245
<i>Everytime I get somewhere
with him,</i>

22:10.313 --> 22:11.646
I just get interrupted.

22:11.713 --> 22:13.981
There's so many distractions
around here.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.318
- Come on.
- What?

22:18.554 --> 22:20.254
We're going for a drive.

22:20.322 --> 22:21.388
Where?
Ty!

22:28.863 --> 22:31.064
I love this place.

22:31.131 --> 22:34.768
Spartan can't be a liberty horse
if he's cooped up behind a fence.

22:34.836 --> 22:37.971
You know, this was
a pretty amazing idea.

22:38.038 --> 22:39.405
Thank you.

22:39.474 --> 22:41.675
I'm glad that an old,
almost mid-twenties guy

22:41.742 --> 22:43.976
with no apparent life
and a roof that leaks

22:44.043 --> 22:45.511
can still have a good idea
every once in a while.

22:45.579 --> 22:49.181
Come on,
what're you talking about?

22:49.248 --> 22:50.516
Never mind.

22:50.584 --> 22:53.719
Okay.

22:53.787 --> 22:55.621
Come on.
Let's jump the jumps!

22:55.689 --> 22:56.889
- Are you crazy?!
- Come on, Ty!

23:00.860 --> 23:02.059
I'm gonna get ya!

23:02.127 --> 23:03.227
You can't
catch up, old man!

23:07.099 --> 23:08.432
No, no, no, no, no.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.596
Hey.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.933
Well, hello, stranger.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.469
Haven't had much
of an opportunity

23:24.537 --> 23:26.438
to talk to you lately.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.040
What do you mean?

23:29.107 --> 23:32.243
Well, what're you up to
with Spartan?

23:32.311 --> 23:33.978
Oh, I've been watching.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.679
I don't really know
what it is myself yet.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.581
I'm just trying
something out.

23:37.649 --> 23:39.050
So when I know,
I'll tell you.

23:39.117 --> 23:40.617
Very mysterious.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.821
Well,
speaking of mysteries,

23:44.889 --> 23:46.356
where's Shane?

23:46.423 --> 23:48.491
Oh, he's in bed.

23:48.559 --> 23:50.060
Nothing mysterious
about that.

23:50.127 --> 23:53.363
No, but Shane and Miranda...

23:53.430 --> 23:55.332
And dad.

23:55.399 --> 23:56.666
Mm-hm.

23:56.734 --> 23:58.701
Well, Shane had a theory.

23:58.769 --> 24:03.038
He thought that dad
had a thing for Miranda.

24:03.106 --> 24:04.340
Is that so?

24:05.141 --> 24:07.243
Why would he get a notion
like that?

24:07.310 --> 24:09.444
Apparently, when they were
staying here at the dude ranch,

24:09.512 --> 24:11.413
dad visited a lot.

24:11.481 --> 24:12.647
Really?

24:12.715 --> 24:13.782
Yeah.

24:14.951 --> 24:17.451
So what do you think?

24:17.519 --> 24:19.320
What do I think?

24:20.256 --> 24:23.524
Well, I think I can think
that I can positively say

24:23.592 --> 24:25.126
that there is nothing
going on

24:25.194 --> 24:27.661
between Miranda
and your dad,

24:27.729 --> 24:30.131
romantically speaking.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.934
And Janice just leaving
like she did

24:34.002 --> 24:36.904
had nothing to do
with Miranda?

24:36.971 --> 24:38.638
Why would it?

24:39.974 --> 24:42.842
I don't know, I guess I just
wanna know what's going on.

24:44.547 --> 24:47.047
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:47.115 --> 24:48.181
Now, more to the point...

24:48.249 --> 24:50.317
What is going
between you two?

24:51.520 --> 24:54.054
Does it really need
a label?

24:59.327 --> 25:00.394
Hey.

25:08.368 --> 25:09.769
Thank you.

25:10.738 --> 25:11.871
For what?

25:13.407 --> 25:16.242
For remembering
the old jumping course.

25:16.309 --> 25:19.177
It's like the perfect place
to practice.

25:19.245 --> 25:20.779
You know what I'd love?

25:20.847 --> 25:22.414
What's that?

25:22.481 --> 25:23.815
I'd love to go

25:23.883 --> 25:25.283
and show Renard
what I can do with Spartan

25:25.351 --> 25:29.120
once... once I can actually
do something.

25:29.188 --> 25:31.256
You're such a show-off.

25:31.323 --> 25:32.558
I am not!

25:32.625 --> 25:34.692
Oh, Renard,
look how good I am!

25:34.760 --> 25:36.326
Check out my mad
horse skills.

25:36.394 --> 25:38.095
I wouldn't say that.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.229
- No?
- No.

25:43.368 --> 25:45.803
Besides,
I don't have any skills yet.

25:45.871 --> 25:49.139
You know, I just,
I wish I knew what Renard did.

25:49.207 --> 25:51.875
Well,
why don't you ask him?

25:51.943 --> 25:53.443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:55.145 --> 25:57.280
Yeah. Maybe I will.

26:00.985 --> 26:02.318
Oh, gee!

26:02.386 --> 26:03.319
- Ty!
- Oh!

26:03.387 --> 26:04.320
No!

26:04.388 --> 26:05.922
I hate this!

26:10.627 --> 26:12.160
Oh, Ty! Okay!

26:13.463 --> 26:15.363
Stop laughing!
It's not funny!

26:24.239 --> 26:25.239
<i>ry:
Oh my gosh.</i>

26:25.307 --> 26:27.274
Twitter is evil.

26:27.342 --> 26:29.110
Even Denise Orachuk
has a date now.

26:29.177 --> 26:30.344
So does Jamie--

26:30.412 --> 26:32.013
some guy
I've never even heard of.

26:32.081 --> 26:34.181
How do girls break up
with their boyfriends

26:34.249 --> 26:36.017
and then within days
they have a replacement?

26:36.085 --> 26:37.351
How does that work?

26:37.419 --> 26:38.586
<i>Jamie's just afraid
to be alone.</i>

26:38.653 --> 26:40.020
<i>That's all.</i>

26:40.088 --> 26:41.387
Have you got any roofing tar
or tin, Jack?

26:41.455 --> 26:42.589
What for?

26:42.657 --> 26:43.857
Well, it rained again
last night

26:43.925 --> 26:45.158
and the loft roof
is leaking like a sieve,

26:45.226 --> 26:46.693
and I gotta do something
about it.

26:46.761 --> 26:48.662
At least you have a problem
that can be fixed.

26:48.730 --> 26:51.297
I have problems--
unfixable problems.

26:51.365 --> 26:52.799
Is she still going
on about the dance?

26:52.867 --> 26:54.300
I wouldn't know.

26:54.368 --> 26:56.669
How am I the only one
in my class without a date?

26:56.737 --> 26:58.070
<i>How did this happen?</i>

26:58.138 --> 26:59.705
Am I that horrible
to look at?

26:59.773 --> 27:01.641
Do I smell?
Do I have an annoying laugh?

27:01.708 --> 27:03.676
No, Mallory!
Okay? Stop!

27:03.744 --> 27:06.245
I'll take you
to the damn dance, okay?

27:06.312 --> 27:07.379
You?

27:08.381 --> 27:09.448
What?

27:13.252 --> 27:15.120
I feel bad to say this,
Ty,

27:15.187 --> 27:19.090
but I would've died for you
to ask me when I was like 12,

27:19.158 --> 27:21.392
maybe even 13.
But...

27:21.460 --> 27:22.794
Now, it's just weird.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.730
You're just too old.
But thank you.

27:35.206 --> 27:36.740
<i>my:
So I tried to get Pal back,</i>

27:36.808 --> 27:38.308
but her new owner--
you know, Reid Tatum--

27:38.376 --> 27:40.510
just flat out refused.

27:40.578 --> 27:44.080
But I guess Shane
is going home today, right?

27:44.148 --> 27:45.548
Yeah, I guess,

27:45.615 --> 27:49.318
but probably won't be
the last time he's here.

27:49.386 --> 27:51.154
I mean, we probably should
get that damn horse back.

27:51.221 --> 27:54.290
He was pretty attached
to it.

27:54.357 --> 27:56.826
Dad, how many times
do you think he's gonna be back?

27:56.894 --> 27:58.227
He does live in Moose Jaw.

28:00.229 --> 28:01.296
Huh?

28:02.765 --> 28:04.032
I, uh...

28:04.100 --> 28:07.035
You just let me
take care of it.

28:33.828 --> 28:35.461
Hey, Caleb.

28:35.529 --> 28:36.596
Hey, it's Ty.

28:37.664 --> 28:38.998
How's it going, man?

28:39.934 --> 28:41.767
Come on, Reid, just gimme a minute
of your time, will you?

28:41.903 --> 28:45.138
Not right now, Tim.
I'm on a schedule here.

28:45.206 --> 28:46.905
Where are you off to
in such a big hurry?

28:46.973 --> 28:49.041
Saddle auction.

28:49.109 --> 28:50.508
Saddle auction?
What, you a collector?

28:50.576 --> 28:51.810
Yeah, big time.

28:51.878 --> 28:52.978
Prize saddles,

28:53.046 --> 28:54.747
rodeo saddles
from all over.

28:54.814 --> 28:57.449
I must have, oh, fifty,
sixty of them by now.

28:57.516 --> 29:00.119
I even have Pete Knight's
saddle.

29:00.186 --> 29:01.686
Now that's
a collector's item.

29:01.755 --> 29:02.721
Really?

29:02.788 --> 29:03.855
And you're wasting
your breath

29:03.922 --> 29:05.723
if you're here
to talk about that pony.

29:05.791 --> 29:06.991
Like I told your daughter,

29:07.059 --> 29:10.795
I'm not interested
in giving her back.

29:43.393 --> 29:44.827
Thank you.

29:45.628 --> 29:48.264
You know, I have been trying
to do what you do.

29:48.331 --> 29:50.099
I even took Spartan away
from the ranch

29:50.167 --> 29:51.532
so there'd be no distractions,

29:51.600 --> 29:54.635
but I haven't been
very successful.

29:55.570 --> 29:57.438
How do you train them
to do what they do?

29:57.506 --> 29:59.207
Love,

29:59.275 --> 30:00.842
understanding,

30:00.910 --> 30:04.112
and above all... freedom.

30:05.681 --> 30:07.181
No reins,
no lead ropes,

30:07.248 --> 30:08.648
no saddles.

30:08.716 --> 30:11.185
You have to trust the horse
to be free;

30:11.252 --> 30:14.354
That he won't flee
when you release him.

30:14.422 --> 30:15.588
You, in fact,

30:15.656 --> 30:18.725
become the leader
of the herd.

30:20.061 --> 30:21.594
Here, try it.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.595
Okay.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.835
Get his full attention.

30:33.106 --> 30:36.675
Now just raise your leg
towards him.

30:41.380 --> 30:42.680
Good.

30:42.748 --> 30:44.316
Other leg...

30:46.285 --> 30:47.752
Now he'll follow
what you do.

30:47.820 --> 30:49.119
You see?

30:49.187 --> 30:50.855
<i>You have an instinct.
That's good.</i>

30:50.922 --> 30:52.757
No domination.

30:52.825 --> 30:54.492
Just trust.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.828
I think you know that
already.

30:56.895 --> 30:58.563
Try it again.

31:03.167 --> 31:04.234
Other leg...

31:09.874 --> 31:11.675
Good.
Good boy.

31:15.446 --> 31:16.513
Good boy.

31:30.059 --> 31:31.694
<i>ne: I just got off
the phone with my mom.</i>

31:31.762 --> 31:33.829
She can't come today
either.

31:33.897 --> 31:36.030
She wants you to call her.

31:36.098 --> 31:38.266
No, I know
he's got school.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.367
Okay, then,

31:39.435 --> 31:42.370
I'll just drive him
to Moose Jaw.

31:43.305 --> 31:45.039
O-okay, okay...

31:45.974 --> 31:46.941
Fine. Right.

31:47.009 --> 31:48.943
<i>So you don't wanna see me,</i>

31:49.011 --> 31:51.545
<i>but you're okay with me
putting him back on the bus?</i>

31:51.613 --> 31:53.246
All right,
I'll...

31:53.314 --> 31:57.117
You better be at the station
waiting for him.

31:57.184 --> 31:58.652
That's all I can say.

32:00.221 --> 32:01.354
It's fine.

32:01.423 --> 32:03.023
I got here on my own,
didn't I?

32:24.143 --> 32:25.877
Whoa... good boy.

32:27.847 --> 32:29.047
Hey!

32:29.114 --> 32:30.615
<i>I went to see Renard again.</i>

32:30.683 --> 32:32.317
He worked with me.
It's so much better now.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.319
It's like Spartan can read me

32:34.386 --> 32:37.021
and I'm understanding him
better too now.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.825
I don't know, it's like a whole
new level of connection, or...

32:40.892 --> 32:42.960
Well, it's pretty
cool to watch.

32:43.027 --> 32:44.562
Are you taking a break
right now, or...?

32:44.629 --> 32:45.696
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:45.764 --> 32:47.364
We've had enough
for today.

32:47.432 --> 32:48.866
There's, um, something I
wanted to talk to you about.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.300
Okay.
Is it about us?

32:50.368 --> 32:51.301
Yeah. It's about us.

32:51.369 --> 32:52.736
It's gonna affect us both,

32:52.804 --> 32:54.637
so, um, in a good way,
I hope.

32:54.705 --> 32:56.639
You sound so serious.

32:56.707 --> 32:57.941
I am.

32:58.008 --> 32:59.408
Well, what's up?

33:00.344 --> 33:03.079
I'm moving outta
the loft.

33:09.065 --> 33:10.398
So Jake keeps phoning me.

33:10.465 --> 33:12.300
I don't know whether
to take his calls or not.

33:12.367 --> 33:15.770
He's probably gonna ask me
to spring fling after all.

33:15.838 --> 33:16.905
What do you think
I should do?

33:16.972 --> 33:17.739
I think it's your decision,
Mallory.

33:17.807 --> 33:19.640
You should make it.

33:19.709 --> 33:21.509
Whoa, I just asked.

33:22.444 --> 33:23.511
Sorry.

33:23.579 --> 33:24.912
You don't have
to bite my head off.

33:24.979 --> 33:26.613
I said I was sorry.

33:27.548 --> 33:30.250
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

33:30.318 --> 33:32.586
Ty's moving out
of the loft

33:32.653 --> 33:35.222
and I don't know why.

33:39.127 --> 33:40.727
I don't know why
you're surprised.

33:40.794 --> 33:42.395
You're the one who helped me
make the decision to move out

33:42.463 --> 33:43.830
in the first place.

33:43.897 --> 33:44.797
I helped you
make the decision?

33:44.865 --> 33:46.366
Don't think so!
How?

33:47.301 --> 33:49.202
Well, you made me stop
and think.

33:49.270 --> 33:50.337
At this stage in my life,

33:50.404 --> 33:52.239
I need something to show
for it.

33:52.306 --> 33:54.474
I gotta grow up
and that's what I'm gonna do.

33:54.542 --> 33:57.843
No. Renting Caleb's trailer
is not growing up!

33:57.910 --> 34:00.946
It's like some terrible
crab-like sideways move.

34:01.013 --> 34:02.147
<i>It's the wrong decision!</i>

34:02.215 --> 34:03.382
No, it isn't.

34:03.450 --> 34:04.783
Yes, it is!

34:05.719 --> 34:07.453
And you know what?

34:07.520 --> 34:09.221
The tar goes on the outside
of the roof.

34:09.289 --> 34:10.356
Duh!

34:14.126 --> 34:15.393
It's Jake.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.193
What should I do?

34:16.262 --> 34:17.527
Pick up it up.

34:17.596 --> 34:19.263
Tell him you'll go
to the damn dance with him.

34:20.831 --> 34:21.899
Hey, Jake.

34:24.835 --> 34:28.639
It's nice of you to ask me
to the dance, but...

34:28.706 --> 34:30.741
Okay!

34:30.808 --> 34:32.576
Okay,

34:32.643 --> 34:35.245
I'll go to the dance
with you...

34:35.313 --> 34:36.813
On one condition.

34:37.748 --> 34:39.549
I'm still holding
onto that horse.

34:39.617 --> 34:41.184
Oh, no...

34:41.252 --> 34:43.520
No, I was just wondering
how you made out at the sale.

34:43.588 --> 34:45.020
Oh. Nah...

34:45.088 --> 34:48.157
Stampede saddle I had my eye on
went to a higher bidder.

34:48.224 --> 34:50.958
Oh. I got an interest in,
uh, saddles myself.

34:51.027 --> 34:51.694
Really?

34:51.762 --> 34:53.195
Yeah. Oh yeah.

34:53.263 --> 34:55.030
Well, as you know,
I was on the circuit forever.

34:55.098 --> 34:56.532
All-round cowboy
five times,

34:56.600 --> 34:59.201
so I got quite a collection
of saddles of my own.

34:59.269 --> 35:01.035
Of course, I just collect 'em
for fun now,

35:01.103 --> 35:02.671
but, you know,
the ones that are my favourites

35:02.738 --> 35:05.072
<i>are still the ones I won.</i>

35:05.140 --> 35:06.240
Check this out.

35:06.309 --> 35:08.810
Oh my,
that is a beauty.

35:08.877 --> 35:11.546
Hudson rodeo.
1989.

35:11.614 --> 35:13.481
And...

35:13.549 --> 35:16.217
The signature.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.753
I don't suppose
you'd be interested in

35:19.821 --> 35:21.655
uh, selling this to me,
now would you?

35:21.723 --> 35:23.857
Oh ho... no.
No, no, no.

35:24.793 --> 35:27.194
Nah, I'd trade it.

35:31.299 --> 35:32.332
<i>ne:
I already told you.</i>

35:32.399 --> 35:33.933
I don't need to learn
how to rope.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.268
I'll never be
a rodeo cowboy, so...

35:36.337 --> 35:37.470
Huh.

35:37.538 --> 35:38.871
Well, you better tell that
to Pal

35:38.939 --> 35:41.841
'cause she's been
waiting for you.

35:43.910 --> 35:46.646
What? You got her back?!

35:46.714 --> 35:47.747
Hey!

35:47.815 --> 35:49.548
<i>Oh, you've grown!</i>

35:49.615 --> 35:50.782
Thank you so much!

35:50.850 --> 35:52.651
Oh! Hey!

35:52.719 --> 35:56.221
Okay. Well, listen,
here's the thing.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.056
You gotta go home.
It's your mom.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.458
She misses you
and she needs you,

35:59.525 --> 36:00.759
and it's just not fair
to her.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.927
So I'm gonna tell you what.
I'll keep Pal here

36:02.995 --> 36:05.262
and you can come and see her
anytime you want.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.130
Deal?

36:07.198 --> 36:08.265
Deal.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.802
Hey... hey, Pal.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.338
Aw!

36:19.745 --> 36:21.544
But what should I do?

36:21.612 --> 36:23.045
He just sorta sprung this
on me.

36:23.113 --> 36:24.714
Should I ask him why?

36:26.884 --> 36:28.251
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

36:28.318 --> 36:29.419
Okay.

36:29.487 --> 36:31.454
Yeah, you give my niece
a kiss for me.

36:31.522 --> 36:33.356
Bye.

36:33.424 --> 36:34.491
Hey. It was Lou.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.964
You know,
I was just wondering

36:43.032 --> 36:45.934
why you'd move into
Caleb's trailer now?

36:46.002 --> 36:47.836
I mean, I thought...

36:47.904 --> 36:49.337
I thought we were together.

36:49.406 --> 36:50.939
More than we'd been
in a long time.

36:51.007 --> 36:52.540
We are.

36:52.608 --> 36:53.641
We are!

36:53.709 --> 36:54.809
It's just...

36:54.877 --> 36:57.111
It's been a really rough year
for us.

36:57.178 --> 36:57.978
I know.

36:58.078 --> 36:59.478
And it seems like

36:59.678 --> 37:01.000
as soon as we
reach this place

37:01.082 --> 37:05.552
where we can be open
and honest with each other,

37:05.620 --> 37:08.422
you wanna change it
and I don't know why.

37:08.489 --> 37:10.357
I don't wanna change it.

37:10.425 --> 37:11.926
It's not like
I'm moving away, Amy.

37:11.993 --> 37:13.560
Yeah, it is.

37:17.097 --> 37:21.334
We can be even more together
if we're apart.

37:22.502 --> 37:24.437
We can make it work.

37:25.372 --> 37:27.606
It'll be good for us.

37:27.674 --> 37:30.910
Is this because
your roof leaks?

37:31.978 --> 37:32.911
No.

37:34.780 --> 37:37.382
I need my own place, Amy.

37:38.318 --> 37:42.254
I can't be the guy
in the loft forever.

37:42.322 --> 37:44.622
Why not?

37:44.690 --> 37:47.492
I love the guy
in the loft.

38:25.828 --> 38:26.761
Good boy.

38:26.829 --> 38:29.198
Well done.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.765
It's a little bit like
one step forward

38:30.833 --> 38:32.368
and two steps back.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.371
It takes a lot of patience,
for you and for the horse.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.105
A lot of trial and error.

38:37.172 --> 38:38.839
But there can be
no power struggle,

38:38.907 --> 38:40.841
and if you're not relaxed?
Forget it.

38:40.909 --> 38:43.411
They can instantly pick up
on your stress

38:43.479 --> 38:44.778
and your state of mind,

38:44.846 --> 38:46.047
but you knew that.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.749
I told you,
your instincts are very good.

38:48.817 --> 38:51.886
You just have to know
when to truly release.

38:51.953 --> 38:53.853
It's like anything in life.

38:53.921 --> 38:56.390
You have to let
before you can move forward.

38:57.325 --> 38:58.392
Yeah.

39:02.892 --> 39:04.459
Good boy, Spartan.

39:07.797 --> 39:08.863
Good boy.

39:15.637 --> 39:16.703
Come on.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.573
Hup.

39:20.842 --> 39:21.909
Here.

39:24.646 --> 39:25.813
<i>Come here.</i>

39:26.747 --> 39:28.981
Good boy.

39:30.183 --> 39:31.484
Whoa...

39:31.552 --> 39:33.553
Good boy.

39:34.755 --> 39:36.989
Amy, that was amazing.

39:37.057 --> 39:38.458
You are incredible.

39:38.525 --> 39:39.792
Way to go.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.261
No collar, no lead...
He's so good.

39:43.329 --> 39:45.129
- Wow.
- Hey, uh...

39:45.832 --> 39:48.399
Can we talk about you
moving out of the loft?

39:48.468 --> 39:52.070
- Amy, I don't--
- No. I wanna talk about it.

39:52.137 --> 39:54.873
It's just hard
'cause...

39:56.275 --> 39:59.477
I don't know,
I'm gonna miss you.

39:59.511 --> 40:00.945
And...

40:01.012 --> 40:04.147
I know in my gut
this is right,

40:04.215 --> 40:07.485
but maybe I am holding on
too tight.

40:08.419 --> 40:10.988
Maybe we need to move forward.

40:11.055 --> 40:13.724
Here's to moving forward.

40:19.429 --> 40:20.997
What do you think?

40:24.234 --> 40:27.236
Well, you look
real grown up.

40:29.072 --> 40:31.840
Okay.
You look very pretty.

40:33.075 --> 40:35.511
But...
I do have to ask you,

40:35.578 --> 40:38.413
why are you leaving from here
and not your folk's place?

40:38.481 --> 40:40.448
Well, if Jake came
and picked me up at my house,

40:40.517 --> 40:42.117
my mom would be
all over him,

40:42.184 --> 40:43.585
telling him how cute he is.

40:43.653 --> 40:44.987
My dad would be too,

40:45.054 --> 40:46.888
except with some kind
of loaded weapon in his hand.

40:46.955 --> 40:50.190
So this is the best idea,
less complicated.

40:50.258 --> 40:51.759
Plus,

40:51.827 --> 40:54.962
They wouldn't understand
that Jake's not really my date.

40:55.030 --> 40:56.030
He's not?

40:56.097 --> 40:57.565
No. He's just giving me a ride.

40:57.633 --> 40:58.833
Why do I need a date?

40:58.901 --> 41:01.502
Only girls who are afraid
to be alone, like Jamie, would.

41:02.937 --> 41:04.738
Jake, good to see you, man.

41:04.805 --> 41:07.073
Good to see you too, sir.

41:08.009 --> 41:08.942
Are you ready?

41:09.010 --> 41:10.143
Yeah.

41:10.210 --> 41:12.145
Um...

41:12.212 --> 41:13.413
Remember,

41:13.480 --> 41:15.081
you're just giving me a ride,
right?

41:15.149 --> 41:16.516
Once we're there,
we're gonna go solo.

41:16.584 --> 41:18.117
Understood?

41:18.185 --> 41:19.251
- Sure.
- 'Kay.

41:32.832 --> 41:35.166
So, I heard a rumour.

41:36.134 --> 41:37.835
Were you planning
on telling me

41:37.903 --> 41:40.271
you're moving out?
Why?

41:41.206 --> 41:44.141
Well, I just...
I think it's a good idea.

41:44.209 --> 41:45.977
Caleb's happy having someone
he knows rent the trailer

41:46.045 --> 41:47.845
and...

41:47.913 --> 41:49.547
Amy and I could use
some space.

41:49.615 --> 41:50.681
Space?

41:51.716 --> 41:53.984
You know,
I tried to stay out

41:54.052 --> 41:56.519
of whatever you two
are going through.

41:56.588 --> 41:58.722
I think I did a pretty
darn good job of that too

41:58.790 --> 42:00.123
considering there were
plenty a times.

42:00.191 --> 42:03.026
<i>I wanted to kick
both your hind ends.</i>

42:03.094 --> 42:06.963
I don't doubt
it took a lot of self-control.

42:07.030 --> 42:10.933
But this is not Amy
and I breaking up, Jack.

42:11.001 --> 42:12.367
I just...

42:13.103 --> 42:15.270
I think it's time to take it
to another level.

42:15.338 --> 42:16.939
Okay.

42:17.007 --> 42:18.841
I don't pretend to know
what you're talking about,

42:18.909 --> 42:20.776
but...

42:20.844 --> 42:23.011
I'll be sad to lose you.

42:23.079 --> 42:24.412
I'll be around.

42:29.118 --> 42:30.551
Another level...

42:31.587 --> 42:33.722
I hope you're not thinking
of using that trailer

42:33.789 --> 42:35.991
as some kind of wild
bachelor pad.

42:36.058 --> 42:38.826
'Cause remember,
I sleep light

42:38.893 --> 42:40.193
<i>and I can still hear</i>

42:40.261 --> 42:42.930
<i>if and when Amy gets home
at night.</i>

42:42.998 --> 42:44.364
As a matter of fact,

42:45.299 --> 42:47.300
if I concentrate,
I can hear the doorknob

42:47.368 --> 42:49.103
on that trailer too.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.681
Okay, try to
behave yourself now.

43:01.749 --> 43:03.783
Don't wanna give your mother
a heart attack.

43:03.851 --> 43:05.818
Next time, we'll plan something
like that together,

43:05.886 --> 43:07.254
'kay?

43:07.321 --> 43:10.023
No more running away.
Is that a deal?

43:10.090 --> 43:11.157
Deal.

43:11.224 --> 43:12.591
Okay.

43:12.659 --> 43:13.959
See ya.

43:14.027 --> 43:15.093
Bye.

43:18.231 --> 43:19.931
- See ya.
- Bye.

43:19.999 --> 43:21.300
Take it easy, kid.

43:23.470 --> 43:24.670
I'll miss you guys.

43:24.737 --> 43:26.805
We'll miss you too.
