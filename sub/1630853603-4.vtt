-Why are you doing that?
-What?

01:16.295 --> 01:19.803
Why are you trying to put a
T-shirt on a fuckin' hot dog?

01:19.836 --> 01:21.774
Kids love hot dogs,
dumbass.

01:21.807 --> 01:24.713
I know. That's why we're making
'em fuckin' hot dogs, dumbass.

01:24.746 --> 01:26.851
Yeah, exactly, Cousin.
It's a tie-in.

01:26.884 --> 01:28.253
This shit is exposure, baby.

01:28.286 --> 01:29.890
I don't need you
exposing anything.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.825
(laughs)

01:30.858 --> 01:33.765
It's a fuckin' hot dog
in a Beef T-shirt.

01:33.798 --> 01:37.271
-That shit is hilarious.
-Go grab me some propane.

01:37.304 --> 01:38.708
You know what,
first of all,

01:38.741 --> 01:40.912
I didn't wanna be doing
this bullshit right now.

01:40.945 --> 01:42.916
Aight, you know what?
Then don't borrow
money from Cicero

01:42.949 --> 01:45.254
you can't pay back,
and then we don't have to cater

01:45.287 --> 01:46.557
little fuckin' kid's
birthday parties.

01:46.590 --> 01:47.926
-How about that?
-I didn't borrow shit, Cousin!

01:47.959 --> 01:49.763
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.
It's on me now.

01:49.796 --> 01:51.600
I don't wanna get my legs
broken, so shut the fuck up

01:51.633 --> 01:53.270
-and help me out, please.
-If that motherfucker

01:53.303 --> 01:56.510
gets even close to us,
I'm gonna fucking drop his ass.

01:56.543 --> 01:58.715
Okay, look, just help me out.
Let's do this right.

01:58.748 --> 02:00.652
-Get it over with.
-Look, second of all,
you have no idea

02:00.685 --> 02:02.388
the amount of
administrative correspondence

02:02.421 --> 02:04.292
I'm supposed to be doing
in there today, okay?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.595
It is fucking bonkers.

02:05.628 --> 02:08.367
-Correspondence? Is that right?
-Yeah. You know,

02:08.400 --> 02:10.772
you like to shit on my system,
but I run a tight ship,

02:10.805 --> 02:12.509
and I get back to my cohorts

02:12.542 --> 02:15.180
and my associates
in a timely fashion.

02:15.213 --> 02:17.786
-Aight, do me a favor.
Just n-name a cohort.
-Name...

02:17.819 --> 02:20.725
N-name an associate.
Just one fucking person.
I dare you.

02:20.758 --> 02:23.463
Timothy, but I-I'm not...
I'm not fucking...

02:23.497 --> 02:25.635
-Gimme a hand.
-It's not gonna fit.
That's not gonna fit, Cousin.

02:25.668 --> 02:28.808
-Yes, it will!
-It's not gonna fit!

02:28.841 --> 02:30.912
-Can you just help me out?
-It's not gonna fit!

02:30.945 --> 02:33.416
It's not gonna
fucking fit!

02:33.851 --> 02:35.320
Come on!

02:35.354 --> 02:38.628
-You want some of this shit?
You want some of this?
-CARMY: Fucking guy!

02:38.661 --> 02:42.201
(Richie laughing)

02:42.234 --> 02:44.540
Yeah! Yeah!
You fucking baby!

02:44.573 --> 02:46.677
You fucking baby!
Fucking baby!

02:46.710 --> 02:48.246
TINA: Morning.

02:48.279 --> 02:50.718
-Ah! Fuck!
-(pop, hissing)

02:54.926 --> 02:58.500
Look what you did.
Fucking baby.

03:00.738 --> 03:04.646
Alright, I'm gonna get
the spare from the basement.

03:04.679 --> 03:06.517
EBRAHEIM:
Hey, Marcus,
enjoying the counter space?

03:06.550 --> 03:08.420
MARCUS:
Yeah, I mean, not having
to do bread anymore

03:08.453 --> 03:09.690
is the shit.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.629
SYDNEY:
Chefs, new prep list is up!
Please check it out!

03:12.662 --> 03:13.831
Thank you.

03:13.864 --> 03:16.302
Chef, can you do me
a favor and try this?

03:16.335 --> 03:17.672
Yeah, sure.

03:22.749 --> 03:24.753
-Whoa.
-Good whoa?

03:24.786 --> 03:26.757
Great whoa.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.459
-It's good.
-Thank you, Chef.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.767
(phone ringing)

03:32.769 --> 03:34.606
Hey. Uh,

03:34.639 --> 03:37.478
did you remember
the mashed potatoes?
Just wanted to check in.

03:37.512 --> 03:40.350
(imitating)
Uh, did you remember
when I said to fuck off?

03:40.383 --> 03:41.887
Okay. "Fuck off" isn't yes.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.724
(normal):
Well, "fuck off" means
I know how to do it.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.260
Alright, well,
it's a new recipe--

03:45.293 --> 03:46.462
-What I just say?
-Okay, well,

03:46.496 --> 03:49.035
just make sure when you do it,
the heat isn't too high--

03:49.068 --> 03:52.509
I answer to Jeff.
The system.

03:52.542 --> 03:55.915
Listen, I'm-- I'm not
trying to be a tight-ass.

03:55.948 --> 03:59.355
I don't want you
to think I'm, like,

03:59.388 --> 04:00.959
-up in your space.
-No...

04:00.992 --> 04:02.629
I'm just doing
what I was asked to do.

04:02.662 --> 04:06.704
And I get what
it's like to be...

04:06.737 --> 04:09.041
-a woman in the kitchen--
-Do you know what it's like

04:09.074 --> 04:11.312
to be a woman in
the kitchen? Wow.

04:11.345 --> 04:13.518
That's amazing.
Listen. I have been

04:13.551 --> 04:16.022
in this kitchen since
before you were born,

04:16.055 --> 04:18.426
so you just back
the fuck off.

04:19.461 --> 04:20.564
Excuse me!

04:23.102 --> 04:26.042
(indistinct radio chatter)

04:26.075 --> 04:28.648
(Richie laughs)

04:28.681 --> 04:30.852
Yo! Yo!

04:30.885 --> 04:33.591
Oh my god. Cousin,
you gotta see this shit.

04:33.624 --> 04:35.528
Yo, this dude is trying
to fuck up this little nerd,

04:35.561 --> 04:39.435
and the fucking nerd
just washes him, bro!

04:39.468 --> 04:41.472
Yo, why the fuck are
you on the Kennedy?

04:41.506 --> 04:43.711
Chill the fuck out.
Cicero lives in Naperville.

04:43.744 --> 04:46.049
No! (scoffs)
Fucking...

04:46.082 --> 04:48.053
Cicero's in Wilmette now.

04:48.086 --> 04:50.424
-You gotta get on
the fucking Edens...
-Shit. No, no,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.027
th-that's right.
That's right. That's my bad.

04:52.060 --> 04:56.102
It's all good though.
I'm in no hurry to
see that motherfucker.

04:56.135 --> 04:57.873
I swear to God, Cousin,
if he calls me "Rick,"

04:57.906 --> 04:59.843
I'ma fucking lose it.

04:59.876 --> 05:01.847
Cousin, listen,
do me a favor, okay?

05:01.880 --> 05:04.085
I'm trying to get us
out of this hole, alright?

05:04.118 --> 05:05.454
I want today to go smooth.

05:05.487 --> 05:06.957
Please do not
bring that shit up.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.830
Chill. I'm not gonna
bring up shit, alright?

05:09.863 --> 05:12.636
-No, you got it all wrong!
-It's literally the easiest

05:12.669 --> 05:14.740
fucking job a person can do!

05:14.773 --> 05:16.409
I'm the only one
who stands up to your ass--

05:16.442 --> 05:18.113
The phone rings,
there's a problem--

05:18.146 --> 05:20.685
-It wasn't my phone!
-You call an electrician
or a plumber, that's it!

05:20.718 --> 05:23.156
I've been saying this shit
for fucking years!
It wasn't my fuckin' phone!

05:23.189 --> 05:25.528
"Oh, Cicero! I'm your guy!
I got a kid now, Cicero.

05:25.561 --> 05:27.766
-I need a fucking real job."
-You think I don't know how
to pick up a goddamn phone?

05:27.799 --> 05:29.803
"Oh, Cicero, can I have
tickets to The Lion King?"

05:29.836 --> 05:31.907
...pick up a fucking
goddamn phone
and we don't even know

05:31.940 --> 05:33.977
how she fell down those stairs.

05:35.615 --> 05:37.586
You want us to get
this stuff out back or

05:37.619 --> 05:39.756
how do you, uh...

05:39.789 --> 05:42.094
Yeah, take it around the side
for me, will you?

05:42.127 --> 05:43.965
-Around the side, sure.
-Yeah, thanks, Rick.

05:43.998 --> 05:46.069
I fucking hate when you
call me fucking Rick!

05:46.102 --> 05:48.774
I fucking hate it when
you don't answer your phone!

05:48.807 --> 05:50.376
Food's here, kiddies!

05:51.980 --> 05:54.686
That was nice.
Thank you for that.
That was good.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.129
(children playing)

06:04.438 --> 06:06.142
Carmen? Is that you?

06:06.175 --> 06:08.848
Hey, Mr. Szorski. How are you?

06:08.881 --> 06:11.052
I thought you'd
killed yourself.

06:11.085 --> 06:13.724
No. Sir,
that was my brother.

06:19.001 --> 06:21.573
RICHIE: Bullshit.

06:21.606 --> 06:24.513
-That motherfucker is
complete fucking bullshit.
-Hey,

06:24.546 --> 06:26.884
-perfect timing. I already
did everything, dick.
-Who does he think he is?

06:26.917 --> 06:28.186
You know he's not
even Italian, right?

06:28.219 --> 06:30.057
100% Polish.
Fucking insulting.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.860
You know you're not
even Italian, right?

06:31.893 --> 06:33.864
Yeah. I'm more Italian
than that guy is.

06:33.897 --> 06:35.568
Turn on the grill.
I gotta get the dogs going.

06:35.601 --> 06:38.674
Just... give me a second here.

06:38.707 --> 06:40.077
Richie, what the fuck is that?

06:40.110 --> 06:42.515
Relax. Shit's regulated.

06:42.548 --> 06:45.989
I suffer from
anxiety and dread.

06:46.022 --> 06:48.460
-CARMY: Who doesn't?
-You want half?

06:48.494 --> 06:50.598
No.

06:50.631 --> 06:52.134
Which, uh, box you
put the ketchup in?

06:52.167 --> 06:54.906
-Hm?
-The ketchup. Which box?

06:54.939 --> 06:56.877
I didn't bring ketchup.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.948
Why don't you bring ketchup?

06:58.981 --> 07:01.553
What kind of asshole
is gonna put

07:01.586 --> 07:03.023
ketchup on a hot dog?

07:03.056 --> 07:05.528
A child, Richie.

07:05.561 --> 07:07.866
RICHIE:
Child asshole.

07:07.899 --> 07:09.870
You're a child asshole.

07:09.903 --> 07:13.109
Yo, yo, Cousin, what's up
with all this gay-ass fruit?

07:13.142 --> 07:15.080
Homemade Ecto-Cooler,
motherfucker.

07:15.113 --> 07:18.721
Oh... shit.

07:18.754 --> 07:20.924
That's actually
pretty fucking dope.

07:21.927 --> 07:22.929
(sniffs)

07:22.962 --> 07:24.565
Rest in peace, Harold.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.805
(sniffs)

07:29.676 --> 07:32.949
One bite of a donut
brings much joy.

07:32.982 --> 07:34.986
Two bites brings sadness.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.623
(laughs)

07:36.656 --> 07:39.763
I mean, nobody doesn't love
that first bite of a donut.

07:39.796 --> 07:41.833
It used to be my favorite
when I was a kid.

07:43.202 --> 07:46.577
-Sweet tooth?
-Yeah, but not even the taste.

07:46.610 --> 07:50.083
I just loved looking at them.
The colors and the textures.

07:50.116 --> 07:52.087
There was this one donut
that I used to love

07:52.120 --> 07:53.991
that I could never
get out of my head.

07:54.024 --> 07:58.233
Jelly filled, bright purple,
sweet and tangy.

07:58.266 --> 08:00.805
Yeah. Family was always happy
whenever we got donuts.

08:00.838 --> 08:03.209
-Hard not to be, young man.
-(laughs) Yeah, yeah.

08:03.242 --> 08:05.715
-My guys!
-Wow. Chester, yes.

08:05.748 --> 08:06.950
-Wow. Thank you.
-Yeah.

08:06.983 --> 08:08.687
-MARCUS: Love you.
-CHESTER: Of course, bro.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.725
-MARCUS: Love you, dog.
-Yes! Ebra.

08:10.758 --> 08:11.960
-EBRAHEIM: Chester.
-TINA: Hi, honey.

08:11.993 --> 08:13.697
What up, T?
What you got over there?

08:13.730 --> 08:16.537
-TINA: Mashed potatoes.
-CHESTER: Woo-hoo!
Wish I had that.

08:16.570 --> 08:19.976
Oh, uh, new edition.
All the fresh colors.

08:20.009 --> 08:23.116
I put a flag on 18-32-24.

08:23.149 --> 08:25.822
It's this radiant orchid
that's fly as fuck!

08:25.855 --> 08:28.059
Hey, thank you so much.
I'ma get this back to you.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.263
Behind! What is good
with the beef?

08:30.296 --> 08:32.000
Oh, yes, Chef.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.071
-Taking it out now.
-Thank you.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.579
-Sup... Hey.
-Hey.

08:37.612 --> 08:39.115
-Who are you? Sorry.
-Oh, sorry.

08:39.148 --> 08:41.119
Chester, this is Chef Sydney.

08:41.152 --> 08:43.724
-Uh, Sydney, this is
my roommate, Chester.
-SYDNEY: Hi,

08:43.757 --> 08:46.763
-Chester... roommate.
-Hey, Chef Sydney.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.339
Cool. Uh, why are
you here? Sorry.

08:51.372 --> 08:52.909
Oh, getting my boy dialed.

08:52.942 --> 08:54.846
Dropping off some
inspirational materials.

08:54.879 --> 08:56.916
-MARCUS: He's a designer.
-Oh!

08:58.052 --> 09:00.089
-What do you design?
-All of it.

09:02.327 --> 09:04.165
I'm out. I'll see you
at home, my G.

09:04.198 --> 09:06.804
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you.
I'll get it back to you.
-Of course.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.641
-Great to meet you, Chef Sydney.
-You, too.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.243
-MARCUS: Good luck
with the meeting.
-Oh, thanks.

09:10.276 --> 09:11.378
Yeah, I'm meeting
a brand ambassador,

09:11.412 --> 09:13.784
so I can't be smelling like
fucking hot giardiniera.

09:13.817 --> 09:15.153
Alright, I'm out.

09:17.692 --> 09:19.796
Huh. Pantone colors?

09:19.829 --> 09:20.831
MARCUS:
Yeah, I was thinking

09:20.864 --> 09:23.136
maybe I could do
a classic donut for The Beef?

09:23.169 --> 09:25.207
On top of my other stuff,
of course.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.377
-Yeah.
-But, I mean,
I think it could be hot.

09:27.410 --> 09:30.918
Yeah. I mean, donuts
are deceptively hard,

09:30.951 --> 09:34.225

Oh, come on. Come on,
come on, come--

21:07.544 --> 21:09.381
Behind!

21:09.414 --> 21:11.519
ANGEL:
Whoa. Come on!

21:11.552 --> 21:14.424
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

21:14.457 --> 21:16.795
-ANGEL: It's cool.
-Oh, fuck! Come on, Tina!

21:21.539 --> 21:22.607
(quietly) Fuck...

21:30.022 --> 21:32.060
Why did you do this?

21:32.093 --> 21:34.498
Because I don't have time
to fuck around.

21:34.531 --> 21:36.034
You're welcome, Chef.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.435
Damn.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.578
CICERO: Coffee?

21:57.611 --> 21:58.946
No. No, I'm good.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.761
Hey, when is that from?

22:05.794 --> 22:08.733
CICERO:
Repeat party, Grant Park, '92.

22:10.804 --> 22:12.808
You ever miss him?

22:12.841 --> 22:14.912
I didn't really know him
well enough to miss him.

22:15.981 --> 22:17.785
You?

22:17.818 --> 22:19.689
Sometimes.

22:19.722 --> 22:22.126
You know, we were so close
in age, more like...

22:22.159 --> 22:25.099
more like a friend than
family. You know, we were...

22:25.132 --> 22:28.439
the same kind of problems
around the same time. We...

22:28.472 --> 22:29.908
had a lot to talk about.

22:31.044 --> 22:32.714
Sounds nice.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.089
It was.

22:39.495 --> 22:41.064
When was the last time
you talked to him?

22:41.866 --> 22:43.837
Uh...

22:43.870 --> 22:45.841
Around 20 years ago.

22:45.874 --> 22:48.713
We had a gnarly fight, man.

22:48.746 --> 22:51.417
-What was it about?
-Million things.

22:52.587 --> 22:54.124
You know, drugs,
alcohol, gambling,

22:54.157 --> 22:55.727
mostly because he just insisted

22:55.760 --> 22:59.702
-on doing stupid
fuckin' shit all the time.
-(sighs)

22:59.735 --> 23:03.108
You know he had a new career,
like, every 10 minutes?

23:04.511 --> 23:06.048
Wanted to be a broker,

23:06.081 --> 23:08.586
and then he wanted to be
a defensive coordinator.

23:08.619 --> 23:10.189
-I'm dead serious.
-(laughs)

23:10.222 --> 23:12.026
And then,

23:12.059 --> 23:15.466
some asshole
invested in Ed Debevic's,

23:15.500 --> 23:17.837
and, you know, suddenly,
he's a restaurateur.

23:19.675 --> 23:22.648
-Sounds about right.
-Yeah.

23:22.681 --> 23:26.121
Really stuck your poor ma
with that place. Man.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.658
I mean, don't you
find it impossible

23:27.691 --> 23:29.929
being in there 24 hours a day?

23:29.962 --> 23:31.799
I-I'm in there
for five minutes,

23:31.832 --> 23:33.770
I start thinking
about bad shit.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.807
Ah, that's probably
why I like it so much.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.178
Yep. Probably why
you wanna fix it, too.

23:40.049 --> 23:41.886
CARMY: Probably.

23:41.919 --> 23:44.057
Just, you know...

23:44.090 --> 23:46.028
Just don't be too
disappointed if it...

23:46.061 --> 23:48.966
doesn't necessarily happen.
Alright?

23:50.937 --> 23:52.608
You know I'm not gonna
sell it to you, right?

23:52.641 --> 23:54.043
I know that.

23:56.716 --> 23:58.853
Had a dream about
him once, your dad.

24:00.724 --> 24:03.062
We were up in, um...

24:03.095 --> 24:05.701
like Lake Geneva...

24:05.734 --> 24:07.971
or someplace,
and we-we're going along.

24:08.004 --> 24:10.977
We're driving along
in this car, big SUV.

24:11.010 --> 24:13.115
He's in the passenger seat,
and we're driving fast,

24:13.148 --> 24:15.219
like, really fast.

24:15.252 --> 24:17.958
And I can't get control.

24:17.991 --> 24:20.897
You know, it's like bumpy cars
flying all over the place.

24:20.930 --> 24:22.767
He wouldn't put on his seatbelt.

24:24.137 --> 24:26.676
Suddenly, this little kid...

24:26.709 --> 24:28.980
a little boy, he walks right
out in the middle of the road.

24:29.013 --> 24:31.819
I jam on the brakes really hard.

24:31.852 --> 24:34.056
Car stops like a millimeter
away from him.

24:35.627 --> 24:37.096
But, your dad,

24:37.129 --> 24:39.200
he goes flying
through the windshield,

24:40.102 --> 24:41.805
but he never lands.

24:43.576 --> 24:45.847
He keeps on flying. (sighs)

24:50.322 --> 24:51.959
What happened to the kid?

24:53.295 --> 24:55.198
I stood there waving at him.

24:57.737 --> 24:58.806
(sighs)

25:02.614 --> 25:05.653
Well, on a, uh,
on a sunnier note,
you have, um...

25:07.189 --> 25:09.995
-you have knocked 2K
off your tab. Congrats.
-(laughs)

25:10.028 --> 25:11.665
Nice seg.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.905
I'm the Seg King.

25:14.938 --> 25:19.849
-So, what do we owe
you now? 298,000?
-298,050.

25:19.882 --> 25:24.057
-What's that 50 about?
-Shipping and handling.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.860
-(quietly) Fucking asshole.
-(Cicero laughs)

25:30.870 --> 25:31.873
Come on.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.977
(tapping, drops spoon)

25:34.010 --> 25:37.116
-SYDNEY: Chef, how
close are the potatoes?
-TINA: (sighs) One minute!

25:38.786 --> 25:40.823
(sizzling)

26:07.811 --> 26:09.915
-Go ahead. Get it over with.
-Get what over with?

26:09.948 --> 26:12.987
Taste it and tell me
it's shitty.

26:15.827 --> 26:17.329
-It's great. Thanks, Chef.
-What?

26:18.933 --> 26:21.672
It's great. Thank you, Chef.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.177
