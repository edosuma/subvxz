01:01.590 --> 01:05.709
Axxon N., the longest running radio play in history

01:06.509 --> 01:10.108
tonight, continuing in the Baltic region.

01:10.108 --> 01:13.987
A gray winter day in an old hotel.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.793
I am going to find out one day.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.392
When will you tell him?

04:47.871 --> 04:51.390
Who could have known??

04:56.269 --> 04:58.789
What time is it

05:13.066 --> 05:16.066
I have a secret.

05:22.865 --> 05:27.185
There have been no calls today.

05:42.862 --> 05:46.381
I hear someone.

05:55.779 --> 05:59.779
I do not think it will be much longer now.

09:27.944 --> 09:29.023
May l help you?

09:29.023 --> 09:31.422
I am a new neighbor.

09:31.542 --> 09:35.022
I live just down the street.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.942
Ma'm?

09:43.821 --> 09:44.941
Hello!

09:48.020 --> 09:50.019
I don't mean to intrude

09:52.019 --> 09:53.019
I am your new neighbor.

09:54.419 --> 09:59.418
I hope that it is not being incovenient for you?

09:59.618 --> 10:01.538
No, no.

10:02.138 --> 10:04.217
Please, sit down.

10:08.017 --> 10:11.016
Such a lovely home!

10:12.335 --> 10:13.415
Thank you.

10:13.535 --> 10:15.215
We enjoy it very much

10:15.535 --> 10:16.615
Please

10:22.014 --> 10:24.014
Uh, would you like uh, coffee?

10:24.614 --> 10:27.534
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

10:28.533 --> 10:29.012
And for you, ma'm?

10:29.132 --> 10:32.012
the same, Henry,
thank you.

10:34.012 --> 10:40.811
I've, l've been going around
meeting new neighbors.

10:41.011 --> 10:44.011
I think that it is important
know one's neighbors.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.930
To say "hello" to them.

10:52.009 --> 10:56.008
Yes, it's very rare these days
but that's very nice.

10:57.408 --> 10:59.928
Which house are you living in?

11:03.007 --> 11:05.007
Just down the way.

11:05.007 --> 11:08.007
Tucked back in the
small woods.

11:08.407 --> 11:11.725
The brick house.

11:12.325 --> 11:15.605
I think l know the one.

11:17.005 --> 11:20.924
It is difficult to see it from the road.

11:37.401 --> 11:38.921
Thank you.

11:59.717 --> 12:02.397
Milk and sugar?

12:08.915 --> 12:10.995
OH, yes, very good.

12:11.595 --> 12:12.995
Will that be all ma'm?

12:12.995 --> 12:14.995
Yes. Yes, thank you.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.194
I'll be just close by
if you need me.

12:19.514 --> 12:20.914
Thank you, Henry.

12:30.992 --> 12:31.792
So...

12:32.911 --> 12:36.191
You have a new role
to play, l hear.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.911
Up for a role

12:39.991 --> 12:43.990
But, l'm afraid,
far from getting it.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.910
No, no, l definitively heard
that you have it.

12:50.988 --> 12:52.108
Oh?

12:53.388 --> 12:54.388
It is an...

12:56.988 --> 12:59.987
Is it an interesting role?

13:00.507 --> 13:03.387
Oh yes, very

13:05.507 --> 13:09.105
Is it about marriage?

13:11.985 --> 13:14.984
Um... perhaps, in some ways...
but...um...

13:14.984 --> 13:18.904
Your husband, he's involved?

13:20.504 --> 13:21.904
No.

13:37.381 --> 13:41.980
A little boy
went out to play.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.980
When he opened his door...

13:44.980 --> 13:48.179
... he saw...
the world.

13:49.298 --> 13:52.378
As he passed through the doorway...

13:53.178 --> 13:57.297
... he caused, a reflection.

13:57.697 --> 14:00.897
Evil was born

14:02.297 --> 14:07.976
Evil was born,
and followed the boy.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.694
I'm sorry...
what is that?

14:19.494 --> 14:22.573
An old tale.

14:22.973 --> 14:25.973
And a variation:

14:26.093 --> 14:27.973
A little girl...

14:27.973 --> 14:31.371
... went out to play.

14:32.971 --> 14:36.971
... Iost in the marketplace...

14:36.971 --> 14:40.370
... as if half born.

14:45.769 --> 14:50.968
Then, not through the marketplace,
you see that, don't you?

14:51.088 --> 14:55.367
But through the alley
behind the marketplace.

14:55.487 --> 15:00.687
This is the way
to the Palace.

15:04.166 --> 15:08.565
But it isn't something you remember.

15:10.165 --> 15:14.964
Forgetfulness, it happens to us all.

15:15.284 --> 15:20.363
And me?... why, l'm the worst one!

15:21.283 --> 15:24.683
OH, where was l?

15:30.361 --> 15:34.481
Yeah.. Is there is a murder
in your film?

15:38.480 --> 15:42.680
Ah, no, it's not part of the story...

15:43.959 --> 15:44.879
No!

15:45.159 --> 15:47.958
I think you are wrong about that!

15:48.958 --> 15:50.558
No.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.477
Brutal fuckin' murder!

15:55.077 --> 15:57.957
Ah... I don't like this kind of talk

15:58.477 --> 16:01.556
The things you've been saying,
l think should go now.

16:03.676 --> 16:04.876
Yes...

16:05.476 --> 16:14.274
Me... I.. I can't seem to remember if it's
today, two days from now, or yesterday!

16:14.874 --> 16:19.953
I suppose that if it was 9:45...

16:19.953 --> 16:23.353
I'd think it was after midnight!

16:27.871 --> 16:29.951
For instance...

16:29.951 --> 16:31.871
If today...

16:32.351 --> 16:34.950
... was tomorrow...

16:34.950 --> 16:42.549
... you would'nt even remember
that you owed on an unpaid bill.

16:45.949 --> 16:46.949
Actions...

16:47.069 --> 16:50.667
... do have consequences.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.867
And yet

16:57.267 --> 16:59.946
... there is the magic.

17:02.946 --> 17:05.146
If it was tomorrow...

17:05.866 --> 17:11.864
... you would be sitting over there.

17:25.942 --> 17:29.261
You see?

17:38.260 --> 17:40.339
Excuse me, ma'm?

17:41.859 --> 17:45.859
Excuse me, ma'm,
telephone.

17:47.658 --> 17:49.057
It's for you.

17:50.857 --> 17:52.937
It's your agent.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.856
Greg!

18:02.456 --> 18:02.936
Greg!

18:05.455 --> 18:06.855
Oh my god! Oh my god!

18:19.453 --> 18:21.253
My God

18:36.130 --> 18:39.929
Nikki, it's we who are happy
and fortunate to have you on board

18:39.929 --> 18:42.929
... on this film,
in this role.

18:43.929 --> 18:46.848
I meant everything l said in
praising Devon.

18:47.847 --> 18:50.847
And forgive me, l do love
making speeches.

18:51.727 --> 18:53.127
I mean this too...

18:53.247 --> 18:56.526
You have everything you need to soar
back to the top...

18:56.646 --> 18:58.926
... and to stay perched there.

18:58.926 --> 19:03.845
This film, you and Devon,
a great director.

19:04.725 --> 19:07.644
Yes, do l hear?

19:08.724 --> 19:10.844
The script is well, we're going to plunge into.

19:10.924 --> 19:14.643
If all play our role,
do our best...

19:14.723 --> 19:16.923
... if we work hard together

19:17.123 --> 19:19.723
...  well, this could be the one...

19:19.923 --> 19:22.922
This is a starmaker, if ever l saw
one, you'll see

19:24.322 --> 19:27.841
I think we have a chance
to pull it off...

19:28.720 --> 19:30.040
what do you say?

19:30.240 --> 19:33.040
Let's do it!

19:33.520 --> 19:37.119
If you don't fuck it up Kingsley,
l'm sure we can!

19:38.319 --> 19:41.319
I never felt better
in my life.

19:41.719 --> 19:43.839
Champaign and caviar
is on its way.

19:46.918 --> 19:51.717
Tonight, Nikki Grace
and Devon Berk.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.636
Marsha, honey l know where you live,
do not pull my hair.

19:54.716 --> 19:55.916
We're back in:

19:55.916 --> 19:59.916
5,4,3,2,1.

20:00.436 --> 20:03.835
Mamas, lock up you daughter's doors!

20:03.915 --> 20:09.913
Nikki, really, this news, this
shocking revelation by Devon...

20:10.033 --> 20:13.633
... must send a shiver down your spine!

20:14.033 --> 20:15.313
Are you going to be able to be true
to hubby with a wolf in the den?

20:15.433 --> 20:19.632
do with a bad wolf round you

20:20.512 --> 20:21.912
Now, Marilyn...

20:21.912 --> 20:26.711
I'm sure we'll get on famously,
in a professional way

20:26.831 --> 20:29.910
and that's how it will stay,
professional.

20:35.429 --> 20:40.109
And, Devon, your naughty boy,
are you hiding a smile?

20:41.029 --> 20:43.908
Is your devilish mind scheming?

20:46.908 --> 20:50.107
If you're looking for shock value Marilyn,
l suggest that you look in the mirror.

20:53.026 --> 20:55.506
What a bitting wit!

20:56.906 --> 21:00.905
But l tell you this:
Marilyn Levins is going to be watching,

21:00.905 --> 21:05.105
and she will be reporting to you
everything she finds out!

21:05.625 --> 21:12.303
There, and there, and there and beyond
around the world!

21:12.423 --> 21:16.303
The Marilyn Levins Starlight Celebrity
show will be back next week

21:16.422 --> 21:17.902
... from Hollywood, California.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.422
Where stars make dreams...

21:20.502 --> 21:24.422
... and dreams make stars.

21:26.021 --> 21:29.220
How were you assholes thinking? That
was the biggest crock of shit l ever saw!

21:29.700 --> 21:30.820
Show's popular!

21:30.900 --> 21:31.900
Bullshit!

21:33.419 --> 21:35.899
OH, you guys, how did it go?
Honey, you were great!

21:35.899 --> 21:38.899
-You were amazing, how do you feel?
You were incredible.  -Good...

21:38.899 --> 21:42.298
You absolutely nailed it.  Did you hear her?
Did you hear what Marilyn said?

21:42.418 --> 21:44.018
She said you blowed! You were perfect!

21:44.698 --> 21:47.497
So Devon, this one's off limits, right?

21:48.017 --> 21:49.017
Don't even think about it...

21:49.297 --> 21:52.616
...If l don't kill you, her husband will,
and he is THE most powerful guy around.

21:52.696 --> 21:55.696
He knows everything. There is not a
thing he does'nt know.

21:55.896 --> 21:58.215
I can tell you stories that
would color your hair.

21:58.895 --> 22:00.815
So listen to me when l tell you.

22:00.895 --> 22:04.415
Around Nikki, keep it in your pants.

22:05.215 --> 22:07.413
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

22:07.493 --> 22:11.213
She's a nice girl, she's so far
from my style, it's not even funny.

22:11.293 --> 22:15.292
Beautiful, Devon. Great.
We'll be able to sleep tonight

22:17.412 --> 22:21.012
You gotta admit though...
She's got a nice ass.

22:26.811 --> 22:28.490
It's good.
-Goodnight guys!

22:28.610 --> 22:30.610
- Goodnight, l'll talk to you tomorrow.
- OK.

22:31.689 --> 22:33.889
-Bye!
-Let's go!

23:09.203 --> 23:10.883
Good morning
Mrs. Grace.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.600
Fantastic.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.799
It all in the beans!

23:29.879 --> 23:34.279
And l 'm just full of beans!

23:36.799 --> 23:37.878
Is that our set?

23:39.078 --> 23:41.678
Yeah
lt's not finished yet

23:41.998 --> 23:45.078
There's Smithie's House.

23:45.198 --> 23:47.076
Smithie's House.

24:02.994 --> 24:07.593
I should have guessed you two professionals
would be here early and beavering away...

24:07.673 --> 24:10.473
We're just laying about drinking capuccino.

24:10.793 --> 24:13.192
Devon makes a great capuccino.

24:13.272 --> 24:14.472
Care for one?

24:14.592 --> 24:18.872
Thanks, but Prey and l just had a cup of tea.

24:18.872 --> 24:22.991
Actually, it was a terrible cup of tea
at the commissary.

24:25.071 --> 24:29.189
"Terrible" is an
adequate description of it.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.986
Well, l thought since we're here
and Smithie site's been started...

24:50.066 --> 24:52.585
We might go over some of the scenes
that take place there.

24:52.785 --> 24:55.785
Not the love scene, of course, but some of
the earlier scenes

24:56.265 --> 24:58.665
that indicate so beautifully your character.

24:59.585 --> 25:05.584
Lets take, for instance,
scene 35...

25:05.984 --> 25:11.782
... the scene where Devon...
you arrive,

25:11.782 --> 25:18.861
... Billy, at Smithie's house to find Sue,
--Nikki-- looking out the window.

25:18.861 --> 25:20.781
I remember the scene

25:20.861 --> 25:22.661
Well...

25:22.781 --> 25:24.861
... we'll go through it....

25:25.860 --> 25:28.459
... and then we'll maybe take it on
the set and plug it out as possible

25:28.579 --> 25:30.379
I guess we should just jump right in?

25:30.579 --> 25:31.659
-That would be jolly good.
-Ok

25:31.779 --> 25:32.779
And, l'll start it off...

25:33.579 --> 25:37.658
...on page 57.

25:37.978 --> 25:42.378
Nikki, this is just a rough run-through
So don't be hard on yourself...

25:42.457 --> 25:45.577
-I am expecting from you, an Academy Award
performance, right out of the gate, so...

25:45.657 --> 25:47.856
Thanks, Devon.
Get going, please

25:55.175 --> 25:57.255
I didn't think you'd be here...

26:00.174 --> 26:02.454
No, of course you wouldn't

26:03.054 --> 26:05.574
... that's because you...

26:06.573 --> 26:07.852
what

26:08.572 --> 26:10.772
what do you want?

26:12.372 --> 26:15.771
I said some things last night
as you know.

26:15.851 --> 26:17.771
Yeah.

26:19.571 --> 26:22.571
And l want to apologize

26:22.771 --> 26:26.250
- Apologize?
- Yeah.

26:29.169 --> 26:32.968
The things you said weren't the truth?

26:33.448 --> 26:35.648
I didn't say that

26:37.168 --> 26:39.648
Were they the truth?

26:49.245 --> 26:50.965
Are you crying?

26:52.645 --> 26:54.245
Uh huh...

26:55.365 --> 26:56.845
Yeah

27:00.564 --> 27:03.364
Are you sorry about last night?

27:04.364 --> 27:06.762
Are you?

27:09.042 --> 27:11.362
Why are you crying?

27:13.162 --> 27:14.841
I'm sorry, Billy.

27:15.041 --> 27:17.441
I'm so sorry

27:18.561 --> 27:19.641
what?

27:23.840 --> 27:26.759
OH, shit.

27:30.159 --> 27:33.238
Look in the other room.

27:33.958 --> 27:35.758
What is that?

27:35.878 --> 27:37.558
Freddy!

27:37.558 --> 27:39.757
No, someone's there.

27:45.077 --> 27:48.075
This stage is ours and ours alone.

27:52.475 --> 27:54.275
Well, let's have a look.

29:02.943 --> 29:03.863
Who was it?

29:04.943 --> 29:08.142
Disappeared where it's
real hard to disappear.

29:15.341 --> 29:17.741
Maybe we should talk,
maybe this is the time.

29:17.861 --> 29:20.860
Let's be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.860
why?
- what is it?

29:22.940 --> 29:24.340
Sit down, l'll tell you.

29:28.338 --> 29:31.338
It was Freddy who
first heard about it

29:33.258 --> 29:36.857
If you have an assistant who can hold his
liquor, then...

29:36.937 --> 29:38.737
... Freddy can do that with the best of them.

29:39.337 --> 29:42.337
Somebody's got to do it,
Gable's dead.

29:44.056 --> 29:47.855
Now, Freddy is purposefully out and about
gathering what in this business...

29:47.935 --> 29:49.935
... is the most valuable commodity...

29:50.055 --> 29:51.855
... information.

29:51.934 --> 29:56.854
Information is indispensable.
You probably know this from your own lives..

29:56.854 --> 30:00.733
... we all have people who gather...
agents, friends, producers...

30:01.333 --> 30:03.853
And sometimes they share,

30:05.333 --> 30:07.852
... sometimes not.

30:08.252 --> 30:12.051
Politics, ego,

30:12.931 --> 30:14.251
... fear...

30:14.851 --> 30:15.931
Kingsley?

30:16.251 --> 30:19.250
sometimes l just isn't told the whole story.

30:21.330 --> 30:24.050
Kingsley,get to the point.

30:31.328 --> 30:35.647
"On High ln Blue Tomorrows"
it is, in fact, a remake.

30:36.327 --> 30:37.927
It's a remake?

30:39.727 --> 30:41.327
I wouldn't do a remake.

30:41.447 --> 30:44.126
No, no no, l know, of course,
But you didn't know

30:44.246 --> 30:48.725
The original was a differrent name.
Started, but never finished.

30:50.324 --> 30:53.124
Now, Freddy has found out
that our producers...

30:53.244 --> 30:57.924
... Know the history of this film and have takenit upon
themselves not to pass on that information to us.

30:59.123 --> 31:00.723
Purposefully

31:00.843 --> 31:02.843
Not on me, and l assume not the two of you...

31:03.123 --> 31:04.123
True?

31:04.523 --> 31:06.841
No, absolutely

31:06.921 --> 31:08.841
Nobody told me anything.

31:08.921 --> 31:11.321
No. Me neither.

31:11.721 --> 31:14.641
I thought this was
an original script.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.920
Yeah, well...

31:20.440 --> 31:22.840
Anyway, the film
it was never finished...

31:22.920 --> 31:26.318
Something happened before
the film was finished.

31:27.118 --> 31:30.638
I don'tot understand.
why wasn't it finished?

31:33.237 --> 31:36.917
Well, after the characters
had been filming for some time,

31:37.037 --> 31:45.236
... they discovered something... something...
inside the history.

31:45.835 --> 31:48.434
Please, Kingsley.

31:48.834 --> 31:52.714
The two leads,
were murdered.

32:01.513 --> 32:05.712
It was based on a Polish-gypsy folk tale.

32:06.311 --> 32:08.831
The title in German was
"Fier Sieben".

32:08.911 --> 32:10.031
"Four Seven".

32:11.511 --> 32:13.710
And it was said to be cursed.

32:19.910 --> 32:22.509
...so it turned out to be.

32:29.628 --> 32:30.427
What?

32:36.027 --> 32:38.027
I don't understand.

32:38.107 --> 32:40.026
Hmm, you don't speak Polish.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.826
No.

32:46.305 --> 32:49.624
I think she understands more
than she lets on...

32:50.424 --> 32:52.024
But l don't speak it.

33:02.623 --> 33:04.622
Take a seat.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.420
What's this all about?

33:23.499 --> 33:26.018
I've been hypnotized,
or something

33:26.818 --> 33:28.617
Hypnotized?

33:31.817 --> 33:34.017
And l'm...

33:37.696 --> 33:39.616
I'm ...

33:42.616 --> 33:44.616
I'm going to kill someone.

33:45.295 --> 33:48.814
Oh, yeah?
Who you going to kill?

33:51.414 --> 33:53.493
I don't know.

33:58.293 --> 34:01.093
Who hypnotized you?

34:03.812 --> 34:07.891
The saw him looking at me once when l...

34:08.011 --> 34:12.290
... when l looked
around the bar, and...

34:13.010 --> 34:16.290
He done moved his hands...

34:18.289 --> 34:20.688
... and he said that l...

34:21.089 --> 34:23.809
... which l would'nt know who l was.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.407
How are you going to kill
this person?

34:28.607 --> 34:31.407
With a screwdriver

35:02.602 --> 35:04.202
Your wife...

35:08.200 --> 35:11.000
I've been with her since
l was a little boy.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.680
A little boy?

35:16.879 --> 35:19.479
Nothin' little about you now...

35:20.479 --> 35:24.199
As far as l heard, that is.

35:29.077 --> 35:30.677
why are you doin this?

35:31.277 --> 35:33.596
Doin what?

35:36.596 --> 35:38.796
Don't play dumb with me, Billy.

35:39.796 --> 35:41.395
I got husband.

35:41.875 --> 35:44.395
You got a wife
and two kids.

35:47.274 --> 35:50.193
why are you doin this?

35:51.073 --> 35:53.673
'cause l never met you before.

35:54.593 --> 35:55.993
what?

35:56.993 --> 35:59.992
I didn't know you before

36:02.392 --> 36:05.791
I never had this feeling.

36:08.270 --> 36:09.990
You have it too...

36:13.670 --> 36:14.989
Don't you?

36:19.669 --> 36:22.469
I can't afford to, Billy.

36:25.188 --> 36:29.067
All l see from this is blue tomorrows

36:34.586 --> 36:36.066
OK, cuts.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.265
That was brilliant
We're moving on...

36:42.385 --> 36:44.665
Check the gate please.
Camera reload.

36:45.184 --> 36:47.663
- Good, good.
- 27 for lunch.

36:49.063 --> 36:51.063
- Did you feel good about it?
-Yeah, l felt great.
-Ok

36:51.183 --> 36:54.983
So we're going to leave this lovely weather?

36:56.462 --> 36:59.982
- Freddy, did you have an ashtray..
- I had one...

37:15.979 --> 37:17.379
Going well?

37:17.459 --> 37:19.779
Very well, thank you, Freddy.

37:20.659 --> 37:22.258
Very enjoyable

37:24.178 --> 37:26.577
Enjoyable, yes,
thats is the word.

37:27.657 --> 37:32.176
Are you enjoying yourself Freddy?

37:33.256 --> 37:37.975
Well, there is a vast
network, right?

37:38.375 --> 37:41.455
An ocean of possibilities

37:43.655 --> 37:45.454
I like dogs.

37:45.574 --> 37:49.173
It used to raise rabbits
l've always loved animals.

37:49.973 --> 37:51.773
Their nature...

37:51.973 --> 37:53.773
... how they think...

37:54.053 --> 37:58.052
I saw dogs reason their way
out of problems.

37:58.172 --> 38:02.971
watched them think through the
trickiest situation.

38:03.971 --> 38:06.450
Do you have a couple of bucks l can borrow?

38:06.850 --> 38:10.450
I've got this terrible landlord.

38:23.648 --> 38:24.648
Thanks.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.566
I got a lot of nerve, l know.

38:29.966 --> 38:34.446
It seems like only yesterday
l was carrying my own weight.

39:13.159 --> 39:15.839
is the 19 year old neice...

39:16.039 --> 39:19.358
Ever since we went into pre-production,
she's been

39:19.358 --> 39:20.758
... fascinated by Smithie.

39:21.038 --> 39:22.838
Keeps going on and on about Smithie...

39:23.958 --> 39:28.356
... asking in that ancient
foreign voice of hers

39:29.636 --> 39:32.236
Who is playing Smithie?

39:56.632 --> 39:57.752
Where did everyone go?

39:59.151 --> 40:04.031
Sorry she taken
Mr. Berg upstairs

40:11.029 --> 40:12.029
Alright.

40:34.625 --> 40:36.025
I listen to you, but...

40:36.425 --> 40:39.345
... I don't hear him.

40:40.425 --> 40:42.144
Excatly sure what your getting in?

40:43.544 --> 40:45.743
I am going to put my arm around you

40:47.543 --> 40:50.742
I want to hold you close.  You don't mind that, do you?

40:53.822 --> 40:55.422
What do you mean?

40:56.022 --> 40:59.021
Sometimes people don't say exactly
what they mean

40:59.221 --> 41:02.021
And you have been guilty of
this all evening.

41:07.019 --> 41:09.539
Now, l'll tell you something.

41:09.819 --> 41:11.219
And l will mean,

41:11.339 --> 41:14.618
... everything l say.

41:16.218 --> 41:19.018
My wife is not a free agent.

41:19.218 --> 41:21.418
I don't allow her that.

41:22.217 --> 41:24.417
The bonds of marriage
are real bonds.

41:24.736 --> 41:26.736
The vows we take,

41:26.736 --> 41:30.016
... we honor and enforce them.

41:30.016 --> 41:34.415
For our selves, by ourselves, or,

41:35.015 --> 41:39.014
if necessary,
they are enforced for us.

41:40.214 --> 41:41.734
Either way, she is...

41:41.734 --> 41:43.414
... bound.

41:43.934 --> 41:46.613
Do you understand this?

41:51.812 --> 41:55.012
There are consequences to one's actions.

41:55.132 --> 41:59.531
And there would, for certain, be consequences to...

41:59.731 --> 42:01.731
... wrong actions.

42:03.131 --> 42:05.129
Dark, they would be, and...

42:05.529 --> 42:08.129
... inescapable.

42:12.008 --> 42:14.608
why instigate a need to suffer?

42:41.604 --> 42:43.804
Bucky J, are you there?

42:43.924 --> 42:46.402
- Is he there?
- Yes, he is there.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.602
I'd say we haven't still got the 2K quite in the right place

42:49.722 --> 42:52.802
I think l'd say up about 2 feet, you'd know better than me.

42:53.402 --> 42:54.721
But it's still...

42:54.921 --> 42:57.921
Boss, you want the 2K down?

42:59.121 --> 42:59.721
Want it down?

42:59.801 --> 43:04.519
Yeah, l'd say about 2 foot down Bucky.

43:05.119 --> 43:07.199
How much you want it to do down?

43:07.599 --> 43:09.599
Yeah, a bit more...

43:09.719 --> 43:12.318
- Keep...
- How far?

43:12.398 --> 43:14.198
Another foot Bucky.

43:14.318 --> 43:16.718
I haven't even touched it yet.

43:16.918 --> 43:21.597
Well then put it 2 foot from where it is...
no, a foot down from where it is Bucky.

43:22.397 --> 43:23.797
"...oss".

43:24.117 --> 43:25.116
What?

43:25.716 --> 43:27.795
Got it, boss.

43:29.915 --> 43:33.595
Bucky, l... Bucky just lower it 2 foot, would you?

43:33.715 --> 43:34.715
From there.

43:34.715 --> 43:36.714
No, Bucky.
It's going up.

43:36.794 --> 43:39.714
I want it down, Bucky,
Two foot lower.

43:39.794 --> 43:42.114
This goddamn time l had a cramp

43:42.194 --> 43:43.713
Just a minute, l'm getting on it...

43:49.312 --> 43:50.512
Thank you Bucky.

43:51.112 --> 43:52.711
Does we it in something else...
-go talk to him...

43:54.791 --> 43:58.191
Just uh... relax for a minute.

44:04.709 --> 44:08.588
Listen, get medics on the scene, and see what's behind this.

44:08.708 --> 44:11.388
- Yes, but. who..

44:11.508 --> 44:12.908
...Phil's on it.

44:12.908 --> 44:15.988
- Phil's in.... We got Phil up there now, Bucky J doin a deal.
-Ok

44:16.188 --> 44:18.307
-  Please guys, lets work on these lighting cues,
alright, we need to work together...

44:22.787 --> 44:26.185
We're almost lit,

44:26.305 --> 44:28.505
Alright, Tim and Sally, five minute warning,

44:28.585 --> 44:33.704

44:33.904 --> 44:37.184
Lockups go to place please,

44:41.504 --> 44:45.382
I'm heading out, you need anything?

44:46.182 --> 44:47.982
Quittin time already?

44:48.782 --> 44:50.101

44:56.381 --> 44:57.901
Wanna stay for a drink?

44:58.181 --> 45:01.700
Naw, l'm late for gym.
- Gym?

45:02.900 --> 45:06.499
Is that with a 'g' or a 'j'?

45:06.698 --> 45:08.178
Oh, that's original.

45:08.698 --> 45:11.498
'G'

45:13.098 --> 45:14.698
what do you do...

45:15.297 --> 45:17.097

45:17.577 --> 45:19.377

45:20.297 --> 45:22.497

45:23.097 --> 45:24.575

45:30.295 --> 45:32.694

45:33.374 --> 45:36.574
Oh, poor small infant child...

45:39.494 --> 45:41.373
One?

45:45.692 --> 45:48.371
Damn

45:58.370 --> 46:00.970
Will there be anything else?

46:03.770 --> 46:06.688
- No, thank you, Jim.
- My pleasure.

46:23.885 --> 46:26.285
You want to stay for dinner?

46:28.085 --> 46:29.365

46:30.164 --> 46:31.684
I think you should.

46:32.684 --> 46:34.084
You do?

46:35.484 --> 46:36.884
I really do.

46:42.763 --> 46:45.082
This is a nice drink.

46:47.561 --> 46:48.961
Nice fire.

46:51.081 --> 46:53.561
wife and children gone..

46:58.880 --> 47:01.360
You talk too much.

47:04.078 --> 47:07.278
So sorry, baby.

47:10.158 --> 47:13.277
Don't ruin this...

47:16.557 --> 47:20.276
There's nothing to ruin Billy.

47:33.074 --> 47:34.474
Done cut.

47:34.554 --> 47:37.553
We copy cut.
Check gate.

47:45.871 --> 47:48.351
Yeah, l was right. Did anyone else read
the script?

47:48.471 --> 47:52.671
The light should fade after Billy's line, do you see?

47:54.070 --> 47:54.950
Look.

47:55.070 --> 47:58.550
Alright alright, we go again please!
Back to 1 everybody!

48:07.148 --> 48:08.468
A car...

48:08.668 --> 48:11.667
A click Al, it wasn't a car, it was a  'click'.

48:11.747 --> 48:13.667
Guys on lockup outside, can we work on that please?

48:13.747 --> 48:18.546
Really, l can't have cars going by without...
No, we had lTC...

48:18.666 --> 48:21.866
I don't think it was... It's something in the wire...
Will you pick that up?

48:27.864 --> 48:31.264
Thanks. I've got a lot of nerve, l know...

48:31.464 --> 48:35.543
... it seems that only yesterday lwas carrying my own weight.

48:37.143 --> 48:38.543
Thanks, Devon.

48:38.663 --> 48:40.543
My pleasure...

48:42.343 --> 48:46.461
That is exactly what we need.

48:52.460 --> 48:54.660
- Camera department, you guys ready?
- Yeah

48:54.740 --> 48:56.860

48:56.860 --> 48:57.740
Can l have some coffee?

48:57.740 --> 49:00.339
Yeah, coffee comming in..

49:03.139 --> 49:07.138
After shooting, do you want to go get
something to eat with me?

49:13.937 --> 49:17.736
I bet you know a cute little ltalian resaurant.

49:19.056 --> 49:20.736
Tucked away

Great food.

49:34.453 --> 49:36.533
Did l say a night?

49:46.131 --> 49:47.251
They're ready for you.

49:47.331 --> 49:50.130
Wait just a minute.

50:02.449 --> 50:05.728
I'll see you after the shoot.

50:12.447 --> 50:13.847
Good luck
and run...

50:14.646 --> 50:16.526
And action!

50:58.239 --> 50:59.519
Billy.

51:11.837 --> 51:14.316
Is it this what you want?

51:21.435 --> 51:24.514
I won't fall in love with you.

51:48.510 --> 51:49.510
And cut!

51:51.710 --> 51:53.710
Are you two happy?

52:10.626 --> 52:11.706
What?

52:13.706 --> 52:14.826
I don't know.

52:17.906 --> 52:19.505
Tell me.

52:21.705 --> 52:22.905
What?

52:25.304 --> 52:26.824
Something's happened.

52:27.623 --> 52:30.023
I think my husband
knows about you.

52:30.103 --> 52:32.303
About us

52:32.423 --> 52:34.943
He'll kill you...
and me...

52:35.303 --> 52:36.702
He'll...

52:39.422 --> 52:40.702
Damn... it sounds like dialogue from our script!

52:43.821 --> 52:45.100
Cut. Cut it!

52:46.100 --> 52:47.620
What's going on?

52:50.100 --> 52:50.820
What?

52:50.900 --> 52:55.499
What the bloody hell is going on?

53:09.496 --> 53:12.696
And we just don't know the actual, real reasons.

53:12.816 --> 53:15.016
... why this film wasn't finished.

53:15.616 --> 53:18.615
Now, you know some stories,

53:18.695 --> 53:21.815
But stories are stories.
Hollywood is full of them.

53:22.135 --> 53:23.014
Thank God.

53:23.014 --> 53:25.334
In this case, the same thing.

53:25.414 --> 53:28.213
Stories which grew out of imagination.

53:28.813 --> 53:32.413
And we're surrounded by these
old stories every day

53:33.133 --> 53:37.012
And they shouldn't be taken as truth.
Or given creedence.

53:37.212 --> 53:40.612
Or jeapordize Nikki's performance.

53:42.411 --> 53:44.210
Unless the stories are true.

53:44.330 --> 53:46.330
Devon...

53:50.809 --> 53:55.809
There is absolutely no proof that anyting
bad happened around this film.

54:26.603 --> 54:29.323
Tie me on and I'll come.

54:29.403 --> 54:31.603
Wait, stop, stop baby...

54:31.603 --> 54:33.522
OH, God! Oh yeah. Oh God Damn.

54:42.121 --> 54:43.600
Ok, our first time...

54:43.600 --> 54:46.120
... fuck and it's good.
OH, please

54:46.200 --> 54:47.800
Babe, you talk too fuckin' much.

54:49.519 --> 54:52.599
- Are you gonna talk through this whole thing?.
- Oh yeah.

54:58.598 --> 55:00.518
It's time.

55:19.595 --> 55:20.595
Remember...

55:21.195 --> 55:22.913
Rembember that thing

55:22.993 --> 55:27.513
When I said that thing
about me...

55:27.913 --> 55:29.513
Remember that?

55:29.593 --> 55:31.712
Yeah...

55:36.912 --> 55:39.711
Remember I told you, about this thing
this thing that happened.

55:43.790 --> 55:46.590
It's a story that
happened yesterday.

55:46.909 --> 55:49.389
But l know that it's tomorrow.

55:49.989 --> 55:51.509
That doesn't make sense

55:51.709 --> 55:52.589
It was that scene...

55:53.109 --> 55:54.589
... that we did yesterday.

55:54.789 --> 55:57.508
When I'm getting groceries for you
with your car

55:57.588 --> 56:00.908
And I was in that alley, and I parked the
car, there's always parking there.

56:00.988 --> 56:02.907
... So there I am...

56:02.907 --> 56:06.386
What?
Sue, damn!

56:09.706 --> 56:11.586
It's a scene we did yesterday.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.505
You weren't in it.

56:13.705 --> 56:18.785
That one where I'm in the alley, I'm going to get
groceries for you with your car.

56:19.105 --> 56:21.384
And I parked there 'cause there's always
parking.

56:21.784 --> 56:23.503
You know the one?

56:23.583 --> 56:26.383
I see this writing on metal.

56:26.383 --> 56:30.582
And l started remembering something...
I'm remembering...

56:30.702 --> 56:34.702
This whole thing starts floodin' in...
this whole memory.

56:36.582 --> 56:40.581
I start to remember...
And I... I don't know...

56:40.781 --> 56:44.300
I do not know what it is...

56:44.380 --> 56:49.379
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

56:50.299 --> 56:51.579
That doesn't make any sense

56:53.378 --> 56:54.578
What is this?

56:56.578 --> 57:00.498
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

57:00.978 --> 57:03.976
Look at me, you fucker!

57:13.575 --> 57:16.695
Please, please

57:16.975 --> 57:18.574
Please

57:19.094 --> 57:20.694
Forgive me.

57:23.573 --> 57:24.973
Please

59:23.472 --> 59:25.472
Look in the other room...

59:26.752 --> 59:28.072
What the hell is that?

59:28.152 --> 59:28.552
Freddy!

59:29.072 --> 59:30.952
No, somebody's over there.

59:35.871 --> 59:38.871
The stage is supposed to be ours and ours alone.

59:43.549 --> 59:44.949
I'll go look

59:48.068 --> 59:50.068
- I'm sorry
- lt's ok..

01:00:48.858 --> 01:00:50.458
Billy!

01:00:54.537 --> 01:00:55.337
Billy!

01:00:56.537 --> 01:00:57.737
Billy!

01:01:31.051 --> 01:01:32.331
Billy!

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.530
Billy!

01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:43.529
Billy!

01:01:48.048 --> 01:01:49.448
Billy!

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.880
Who the hell are you?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.399
Hey!

01:06:35.799 --> 01:06:39.199
Look at us and tell us
if you've known us before.

01:06:41.478 --> 01:06:42.798
There was a man...

01:06:43.598 --> 01:06:44.797
... I once knew

01:06:49.597 --> 01:06:53.396
Was it like this.. look around.

01:06:55.676 --> 01:06:59.876
Did he do that thing... you know
that little shaking thing?

01:07:00.395 --> 01:07:03.594
While he was...

01:07:02.194 --> 01:07:05.674
You know...

01:07:08.673 --> 01:07:10.593
Wasn't that great...

01:07:12.473 --> 01:07:13.873
Yeah

01:07:20.192 --> 01:07:21.591
I'd let him do....

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:25.390
... anything

01:07:49.267 --> 01:07:50.986
Strange...

01:07:51.186 --> 01:07:52.466
...what love does.

01:07:58.386 --> 01:08:01.384
So strange.

01:08:07.463 --> 01:08:08.983
In the bedroom

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:16.381
- You'll be dreaming...
- The kind of sleep...

01:08:17.982 --> 01:08:21.060
When you open the eyes...

01:08:21.581 --> 01:08:25.380
someone familiar will be there.

01:09:09.252 --> 01:09:10.973
This is the street.

01:09:16.572 --> 01:09:19.171
Do you want to see?

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:32.969
Just down the way.

01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:48.416
Breakfast

01:18:42.995 --> 01:18:46.955
I don't really understand
what l'm doing here.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:54.954
That's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

01:18:57.473 --> 01:19:01.592
So I was told you could help me.

01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:15.270
I guess I'll just tell you the thing..

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:19.749
I just know that am l.

01:19:37.866 --> 01:19:39.785
There was this man...

01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:45.145
... I once knew...

01:19:45.344 --> 01:19:47.464
His name was...

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.984
It doesn't matter what his name was...

01:19:54.383 --> 01:19:57.663
A lot of guys change.

01:19:58.063 --> 01:20:00.262
They don't change, but they reveal

01:20:02.581 --> 01:20:05.261
In time they reveal
what they really are.

01:20:05.661 --> 01:20:08.781
You know what l mean?

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.980
It is an old story.

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.460
Well this guy...

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.258
...he revealed something.

01:20:22.858 --> 01:20:24.778
Looking back on it...

01:20:27.377 --> 01:20:30.857
All along it was being revealed.

01:20:33.857 --> 01:20:36.976
He was planning something...

01:20:37.776 --> 01:20:41.255
... planning something with me
in mind.

01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:56.773
When l get mad,
I really get mad

01:20:58.373 --> 01:21:03.371
I gouged a man's eye out when I
was 15 once, he was trying to rape me...

01:21:03.451 --> 01:21:06.371
I mean, the fucker had it out
pushing my legs apart.

01:21:08.371 --> 01:21:10.450
I got a finger on his eyes socket,

01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:14.370
pretty  quick, rape was quite a long
way off his mind.

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:19.368
He was crying and screaming like a baby.

01:21:20.168 --> 01:21:22.968
"What a fuckin man you are," I said.

01:21:26.847 --> 01:21:28.367
There was goo...

01:21:29.247 --> 01:21:32.247
He still could still see
me with the one eye.

01:21:32.447 --> 01:21:37.046
See me comin' at him, grabbin' his nuts
and tearin' at 'em.

01:21:38.846 --> 01:21:41.365
He'd seen that alright, felt it too.

01:21:42.644 --> 01:21:45.764
He was screamin' and wailin' like a little baby.

01:21:47.964 --> 01:21:50.643
He sat in the corner cryin'

01:21:50.963 --> 01:21:54.643
Alone and huggin' his nuts 'till the ambulance come

01:21:55.963 --> 01:21:58.762
the ambulance guys, they say:

01:21:58.842 --> 01:22:01.841
"What the fuck happened here?"

01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:04.961
I say:

01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:08.840
... "He come to a reapin' what he had been sowin', that's what."

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.360
They say:

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.759
"Fucker been sowing some kind of heavy shit..."

01:22:57.232 --> 01:22:59.032
It's the shits...

01:23:02.831 --> 01:23:05.430
I really thought you would last, you two.

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:10.030
I saw it coming...

01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:14.949
Sorry, I did!

01:23:16.429 --> 01:23:19.348
You're full of shit Dorry...

01:23:29.627 --> 01:23:31.226
Sucks....He was the one...

01:23:32.226 --> 01:23:35.546
I really thought he was,

01:23:40.144 --> 01:23:42.944
So what
He's gone

01:23:44.944 --> 01:23:46.823

01:23:55.342 --> 01:23:57.422
OH, baby...

Tonight we'll change that.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:07.540
Yeah. Tonight

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.539
There's always a chance

01:24:16.819 --> 01:24:18.539

01:24:51.933 --> 01:24:53.212
Thanks guys

01:25:42.923 --> 01:25:46.003
I started saving some money

So now we rich?

01:25:50.723 --> 01:25:53.202

01:25:55.402 --> 01:25:57.802
What is the money for?

01:25:58.002 --> 01:26:01.920
If it won't bring something like hope?

01:26:18.997 --> 01:26:21.917
I'm pregnant.

01:26:26.596 --> 01:26:28.516
Oh... Funny one!

01:26:30.196 --> 01:26:33.195
I am pregnant.

01:26:40.514 --> 01:26:42.513
What is this?

01:26:44.113 --> 01:26:46.393
You don't seem too happy about it!

01:26:54.512 --> 01:26:56.512
Your pregnant?

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:07.109
What is it?

01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:10.309
What's wrong?

01:27:16.908 --> 01:27:19.187
It just that it come as a shock to me

01:28:40.293 --> 01:28:41.373
Hello?

01:28:43.893 --> 01:28:45.373
Hello?

01:29:14.968 --> 01:29:16.288
Billy?

01:29:40.963 --> 01:29:44.962
I seen a man come at me with
a crow bar once.

01:29:45.682 --> 01:29:49.682
Guess he figured I was two-timing him.

01:29:51.482 --> 01:29:53.161
I was coming home.

01:29:53.561 --> 01:29:56.761
We were shacked up at the time.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:04.879
He was waiting for me in the half-light.

01:30:08.479 --> 01:30:10.558
Waitin' for me to come home.

01:30:11.078 --> 01:30:14.478
I guess he worked himself
into some kind of frenzy.

01:30:14.758 --> 01:30:17.957
I opened the fuckin' door.

01:30:18.756 --> 01:30:22.276
And l seen his fuckin' shape burst out
of the chair....

01:30:23.556 --> 01:30:25.076
and a crow-bar goin up

01:30:25.755 --> 01:30:29.355
I screamed and turned

01:30:31.355 --> 01:30:33.155
Fuckin' crow bar comes down....

01:30:33.475 --> 01:30:37.274
... smashin' into that fuckin' door

01:30:37.354 --> 01:30:39.553
... cheap piece of shit...

01:30:40.073 --> 01:30:42.552
... it just splinters into 1000 pieces

01:30:42.672 --> 01:30:45.952
... like it was glass, shit flyin' everywhere

01:30:46.752 --> 01:30:49.552
I don't take this kind
of behavior.

01:30:54.471 --> 01:30:56.671
I seen what this fucko is up to

01:30:57.551 --> 01:30:58.550
Bam!

01:31:00.469 --> 01:31:03.269
I kick him in the nuts so hard that
they go crawling into his brain

01:31:03.349 --> 01:31:04.949
... for refuge.

01:31:04.949 --> 01:31:08.068
He goes down like a $2 whore.

01:31:08.348 --> 01:31:12.868
... cryin' and shit and tell me that he's
never done nothing but love me bullshit...

01:31:16.467 --> 01:31:20.466
Were you in fact seeing another man?

01:31:23.066 --> 01:31:26.545
I was screwing a couple guys for drinks,
no big deal.

01:31:31.465 --> 01:31:34.144
This one guy, he was kinda cute

01:31:34.744 --> 01:31:39.863
Fucker had a dick like a rhinocerous.
He'd fuck the shit out of you, I'll tell you what...

01:31:45.942 --> 01:31:48.142
He'd buy me a couple of drinks after.

01:31:53.261 --> 01:31:54.741
We'd talk.

01:31:54.861 --> 01:31:58.059
He'd tell me about a town he grew up in.

01:31:58.339 --> 01:32:01.859
All the little girls he'd fuck

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:06.058
There was a chemical factory in this town
and, uh....

01:32:07.858 --> 01:32:11.658
Telling us it was putting so much shit
in the air you couldn't think straight.

01:32:14.657 --> 01:32:16.937
I got to a lot of the people.

01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:22.655
there was a lot of crazy shit going on there.

01:32:24.255 --> 01:32:27.055
People having weird dreams, and...

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:32.134
... seeing things that wasn't there.

01:32:34.734 --> 01:32:38.053
So one time, this one little girl...

01:32:40.532 --> 01:32:42.732
... she was starin' off at somethin' one time...

01:32:43.132 --> 01:32:45.132
... starts screaming

01:32:45.932 --> 01:32:49.931
They.. the... people hanging around,
they come to her and

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:53.731
... ask her what's wrong, and uh....

01:32:57.530 --> 01:33:00.129
She says she sees the end of the world.

01:33:02.729 --> 01:33:05.728
... on fire, and smoke
and blood rain".

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:09.128
You know, like they say...

01:33:11.048 --> 01:33:14.647
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

01:33:17.207 --> 01:33:19.206
Hey!

01:33:23.325 --> 01:33:24.725
Look at me!

01:33:25.645 --> 01:33:28.644
And l tell me if you've known me before.

01:33:31.644 --> 01:33:36.124
Yes,
we will do that.

01:33:48.241 --> 01:33:49.921
Where is the paper towels?

01:34:10.317 --> 01:34:13.317
They're behind you, on the table.

01:36:00.498 --> 01:36:01.098
Who is she?

01:36:08.617 --> 01:36:10.097
Who is she?

01:36:41.211 --> 01:36:43.491
I almost didn't recognize you

01:36:46.891 --> 01:36:48.690
You startled me

01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:54.490
Strange...to find you on the street

01:37:00.408 --> 01:37:02.208
You seem upset.

01:37:03.688 --> 01:37:05.407
Are you?

01:37:06.607 --> 01:37:08.287
Should l be?

01:37:10.887 --> 01:37:13.406
- No, but...
- So l shouldn't be?

01:37:16.406 --> 01:37:17.405
No

01:37:18.405 --> 01:37:20.285
But still, you seem so

01:37:22.884 --> 01:37:24.604
I think you don't recognize me

01:37:28.604 --> 01:37:30.683
I think you don't recognize my manners

01:37:33.883 --> 01:37:35.483
That's true

01:37:36.683 --> 01:37:39.801
- You seem different
- You too

01:37:45.681 --> 01:37:49.600
I'm used to seeing you in our home,
not on the street,

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.400
at night

01:37:55.399 --> 01:37:57.398
Me too

01:38:05.877 --> 01:38:07.397
There was a murder

01:38:11.876 --> 01:38:13.596
How awful!

01:38:15.076 --> 01:38:17.395
- Where?
- Just down the way

01:38:18.995 --> 01:38:20.394
I think...

01:38:21.394 --> 01:38:22.994
...you knew the victim

01:38:26.194 --> 01:38:28.793
- Who was it?
- Don't know the name

01:38:31.393 --> 01:38:33.673
But l have seen you with this person

01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:39.871
- You have?
- Yes

01:38:42.471 --> 01:38:44.391
I think l've seen the two of you together

01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:55.389
That's awful

01:39:23.464 --> 01:39:25.464
Who are those people?

01:39:25.784 --> 01:39:27.783
Hey, hello!

01:39:28.983 --> 01:39:29.983
Good to see you.

01:39:30.983 --> 01:39:32.383
Come in, come in.

01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:35.182
Get some hot-dog.

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:40.781
You said 3 o'clock.

01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:43.460
Yes, that's right.

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:45.780
You're right on time.

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:50.460
The situation is becoming serious

01:39:56.579 --> 01:39:57.378
Give me my hammer.

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:58.978
Give me that!

01:39:59.657 --> 01:40:01.457
Gives me now.

01:40:07.177 --> 01:40:10.176
Did you see?

01:40:24.653 --> 01:40:27.053
There is no paper.
For the toilet.

01:40:27.573 --> 01:40:28.973
There is no paper.

01:40:30.053 --> 01:40:34.172
It is under the sink,
in the cupboard.

01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:47.970
what?

01:40:52.369 --> 01:40:55.769
They are a group that performs in
travelling shows.

01:40:55.969 --> 01:40:58.647
In the Baltic region

01:41:01.247 --> 01:41:04.567
What's that got to do with you?

01:41:05.247 --> 01:41:08.366
I will care for the animals.

01:41:14.645 --> 01:41:18.364
It was said that I have a way with animals.

01:41:27.643 --> 01:41:30.962
Fucker went to some eastern
europe shithole

01:41:31.442 --> 01:41:34.442
... with the fuckin' circus.

01:41:37.241 --> 01:41:40.040
Can you fuckin believe that?

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.960
That circus...

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.159
... talk about carnies... Carnies, gypsies,
conmen, you name it.

01:41:51.439 --> 01:41:53.959
A real fuckin' ball of shit.

01:42:00.957 --> 01:42:03.557
There was this guy they had working there.

01:42:06.836 --> 01:42:07.956
He'd start talkin'.

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:11.356
... you know, real regular.

01:42:12.555 --> 01:42:14.035
Talkin' up the crowd.

01:42:14.555 --> 01:42:16.435
They'd start listening...

01:42:16.754 --> 01:42:19.634
...   Pushin' in closer.

01:42:20.753 --> 01:42:23.833
He did some sort of thing on people.

01:42:27.353 --> 01:42:30.232
They all called him the phantom.

01:42:34.432 --> 01:42:37.830
He got in a bar room fight one night...

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:40.230
All the bar was arrested.

01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:43.630
A lot of them fuckin' circus clowns.

01:42:46.949 --> 01:42:49.829
So when they take 'em all down to the station,

01:42:50.429 --> 01:42:52.149
Guess what?  ...

01:42:53.948 --> 01:42:56.028
... the Phantom's done gone and disappeared.

01:42:56.427 --> 01:42:59.427
This is the kind of
shit I'm talking about.

01:43:08.426 --> 01:43:11.145
He was a marine from North Carolina.

01:43:14.945 --> 01:43:17.424
I had a sister with one leg.

01:43:17.544 --> 01:43:21.823
... she had a sort of carved stick for the other one.

01:43:25.823 --> 01:43:29.942
She killed three kids in the first grade.

01:43:30.022 --> 01:43:33.422
This is the kind of shit.

01:43:43.939 --> 01:43:45.539
Fuckin' funny.

01:43:49.419 --> 01:43:50.939
People.

01:43:52.218 --> 01:43:54.738
All got their own peculiarities.

01:43:55.618 --> 01:43:58.337
Their own way of livin'

01:46:15.914 --> 01:46:16.913
What about school?

01:46:17.833 --> 01:46:18.913
One more day.

01:46:20.513 --> 01:46:21.433
One more day?

01:46:22.432 --> 01:46:23.712
Maybe two.

01:46:32.911 --> 01:46:34.591
Susan?

01:46:35.911 --> 01:46:38.190
What are you doing here?

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:43.309
What?

01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:46.189
I thought you were gone.

01:46:57.306 --> 01:46:58.106
Billy.

01:47:01.426 --> 01:47:02.386
Billy.

01:47:04.905 --> 01:47:06.105
Something's wrong.

01:47:06.105 --> 01:47:08.305
Bad wrong.
Do you feel it?

01:47:14.904 --> 01:47:15.903
Sue?

01:47:17.223 --> 01:47:18.103
Billy.

01:47:19.223 --> 01:47:20.302
Do you love me?

01:47:21.702 --> 01:47:22.982
what?

01:47:27.502 --> 01:47:28.421
Billy.

01:47:29.301 --> 01:47:30.381
Sue.

01:47:32.501 --> 01:47:36.180
Don't you remember anything?
How it was?

01:47:37.819 --> 01:47:40.699
I don't understand what you're talking about.

01:47:42.899 --> 01:47:44.219
Are you kidding?

01:47:45.098 --> 01:47:46.378
No.

01:47:49.098 --> 01:47:50.698
You go on, Sue.

01:47:51.218 --> 01:47:52.298
You go on now...

01:47:53.098 --> 01:47:54.897
Would you like me to call the police?

01:47:55.896 --> 01:47:57.696
No, we can handle this.

01:48:05.695 --> 01:48:06.495
Billy.

01:48:06.495 --> 01:48:07.815
Something is wrong

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.694
I love you, Billy.

01:48:11.094 --> 01:48:14.574
I've had just enough.

01:48:16.813 --> 01:48:18.173
I love you

01:48:20.812 --> 01:48:22.572
Go away, Susan.

01:48:22.812 --> 01:48:24.292
I love you

01:48:26.212 --> 01:48:27.371
Sue!

01:48:29.611 --> 01:48:30.691
I don't care

01:48:31.691 --> 01:48:33.891
It's something more.

01:48:40.409 --> 01:48:43.888
I do not care
lt's something more.

01:50:39.469 --> 01:50:40.788
Gordy

01:50:45.868 --> 01:50:47.268
What do you want?

01:50:51.067 --> 01:50:52.467
Where is he?

01:50:53.467 --> 01:50:56.665
What's the point?
Are you blind? He's gone!

01:51:00.465 --> 01:51:01.865
Everybody?

01:51:04.784 --> 01:51:07.584
Why answer your stupid question?

01:51:08.064 --> 01:51:10.464
You're nothing! You've done nothing!

01:51:16.582 --> 01:51:18.582
Where did he go?

01:51:20.662 --> 01:51:24.821
No idea. He talked... mumbled
something about lnland Empire.

01:53:12.043 --> 01:53:15.842
I come about an unpaid bill that needs payin'

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:23.121
All right

01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:34.639
Do you know a man who lives here?

01:53:53.236 --> 01:53:54.516
Do you know him?

01:53:55.635 --> 01:53:58.635
Yes. What is it?  What do you want?

01:53:59.354 --> 01:54:02.034
Which you want?

01:54:05.634 --> 01:54:10.033
He has an unpaid bill that needs payin'

01:54:10.833 --> 01:54:14.753
You already said that.

01:54:19.551 --> 01:54:21.431
Do you know a man who lives next door?

01:54:22.351 --> 01:54:25.110
Crimp is the name...

01:54:33.549 --> 01:54:36.028
It was a funny name.

01:54:36.948 --> 01:54:40.628
They was called Crimp.

01:55:09.023 --> 01:55:10.303
Hey?

01:56:43.407 --> 01:56:45.646
There's someone there

01:56:47.406 --> 01:56:49.126
I have to tell you

01:56:50.766 --> 01:56:52.406
There's someone

01:57:07.403 --> 01:57:08.803
Do you recognize her?

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.521
I don't see her

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.720
You understand she was sent for you?

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.520
I don't know where l am

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:40.117
- I hear her now
- Do you see her?

01:57:42.717 --> 01:57:43.796
No

01:57:45.996 --> 01:57:47.596
It was...

01:57:51.396 --> 01:57:52.595
...red

01:57:59.514 --> 01:58:01.193
You work for someone?

01:58:04.513 --> 01:58:05.913
Yes

01:58:08.193 --> 01:58:10.712
The one she spoke of

01:58:15.511 --> 01:58:17.510
Yes, l work for him

01:58:18.710 --> 01:58:20.590
So you understand

01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:26.909
The horse was taken...

01:58:28.509 --> 01:58:30.389
...to the well

01:58:46.306 --> 01:58:47.906
Take the pistol

01:58:51.185 --> 01:58:52.585
Let's go!

01:59:05.183 --> 01:59:07.582
Right away! It's past midnight!

02:00:18.090 --> 02:00:22.089
I am going to find out one day.

02:00:26.289 --> 02:00:28.089
It was red.

02:00:33.168 --> 02:00:34.687
Where was I?

02:00:40.686 --> 02:00:44.686
This isn't the way it was.

02:00:58.763 --> 02:01:02.283
It was the man in the green coat.

02:01:05.082 --> 02:01:09.762
It had something to do with
the telling of time.

02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:22.749
I am a whore.

02:02:28.068 --> 02:02:29.948
Where am I?

02:02:30.068 --> 02:02:32.348
I'm afraid

02:04:28.848 --> 02:04:32.727
Just a moment.

02:04:36.526 --> 02:04:39.445
I need to make a collect call.

02:05:59.032 --> 02:06:00.712
Look at me

02:06:02.312 --> 02:06:04.631
And tell me if you've known me before

02:06:45.704 --> 02:06:49.704
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

02:06:59.702 --> 02:07:01.621
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

02:07:01.701 --> 02:07:03.701
You gotta let me in. I know
a girl.

02:07:03.821 --> 02:07:06.501
Carolina.
I know Carolina.

02:09:16.678 --> 02:09:21.678
-I don't really understand what I'm doing.
-It's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

02:09:24.477 --> 02:09:26.677
There was this man...

02:09:27.677 --> 02:09:31.396
... I once knew

02:09:34.675 --> 02:09:38.195
I'm trying to tell you so you understand
how it went.

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:44.594
The thing is, I don't know....

02:09:44.674 --> 02:09:48.193
... what was before or after.

02:09:53.192 --> 02:09:55.671
I don't know what's happened first...

02:09:56.191 --> 02:09:59.671
...and it's kinda layin' a mindfuck on me.

02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.670
My husband...

02:10:10.670 --> 02:10:14.388
... he's fuckin' hidin' somethin'

02:10:15.388 --> 02:10:18.668
He was acting all fuckin' weird one
night before he left...

02:10:23.907 --> 02:10:27.467
He was talkin this foreign talk and...

02:10:28.986 --> 02:10:32.186
... tellin' loud fuckin' stories...

02:10:45.303 --> 02:10:47.663
I'm not who you think I am.

02:10:50.463 --> 02:10:51.783
Are you listening to me?

02:10:54.901 --> 02:10:56.981
I know it for a fact.

02:10:58.461 --> 02:11:02.380
I can't father children.

02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:10.859
Like this... his face all red...
his eyes buggin' out...

02:11:40.574 --> 02:11:43.094
I figured one day...

02:11:44.493 --> 02:11:46.493
... I'd just wake up and...

02:11:46.693 --> 02:11:50.653
... I find out what the hell yesterday
was all about.

02:11:54.891 --> 02:11:58.571
I'm not too keen on thinking about tomorrow.

02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:02.970
And today's slippin' by.

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:24.047
I guess after my son died,

02:12:25.566 --> 02:12:26.686
I went into a bad time.

02:12:29.686 --> 02:12:34.644
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

02:12:41.484 --> 02:12:45.643
Watchin it, like in a dark theater.

02:12:48.163 --> 02:12:50.442
before they bring lights up.

02:12:55.681 --> 02:12:57.361
... I'm sittin there,

02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:00.640
... wonderin...

02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:05.360
... "how can this be?"

02:13:46.953 --> 02:13:48.232
Hello?

02:13:48.672 --> 02:13:51.952
Yeah, she's still here.

02:13:54.951 --> 02:13:57.230
I don't think it will be too much longer now.

02:13:59.870 --> 02:14:01.430
Yeah, the horse to the well.

02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:04.869
Yeah.

02:14:07.869 --> 02:14:11.749
Yeah, he's around here someplace.

02:14:15.067 --> 02:14:18.627
Sure, I'm on it.

02:15:08.939 --> 02:15:10.739
What have you been up to?

02:15:11.139 --> 02:15:12.617
Where did you go?

02:15:15.857 --> 02:15:17.337
Where 'you been?

02:15:23.136 --> 02:15:24.816
Someone's there.

02:15:27.936 --> 02:15:29.215
Look.

02:15:52.651 --> 02:15:55.010
Hey, watch this move!

02:18:58.898 --> 02:19:01.499
You' dyin lady.

02:19:30.214 --> 02:19:33.293
what you say
about Pomona?

02:19:34.293 --> 02:19:37.413
what you say
about Pomona?

02:19:38.611 --> 02:19:42.291
You asked about the bus.

02:19:42.812 --> 02:19:46.290
Can't get no bus to Pamona.

02:19:48.011 --> 02:19:50.811
You can get the bus for Pamona here.

02:19:51.690 --> 02:19:54.889
If you get on the subway first.

02:19:57.209 --> 02:20:00.409
I never can get no bus.

02:20:04.408 --> 02:20:08.088
You can go all around Hollywood.

02:20:08.208 --> 02:20:12.686
I was in Hollywood Irvine,

02:20:12.886 --> 02:20:17.486
And you can get to Pomona
for 3,50.

02:20:17.486 --> 02:20:21.285
From Hollywood, Irvine to Pamona

02:20:23.205 --> 02:20:26.285
I never heard
of no bus there.

02:20:28.084 --> 02:20:31.204
I ride on the bus
to Pomona...

02:20:31.204 --> 02:20:34.563
.. Iast summer
to visit my friend...

02:20:34.603 --> 02:20:38.482
.. who lives there.
Her name is Nico.

02:20:38.402 --> 02:20:43.202
I stayed with her
two weeks.

02:20:45.001 --> 02:20:47.881
My cousin comes from Pomona.

02:20:49.601 --> 02:20:53.879
She has a place there, and said
I can stay there.

02:20:56.599 --> 02:20:59.079
What time is it

02:21:01.078 --> 02:21:03.158
I don' know.

02:21:04.678 --> 02:21:06.878
It's after midnight.

02:21:07.678 --> 02:21:09.397
After midnight?

02:21:10.597 --> 02:21:14.996
My friend Nico, who lives
in Pomona...

02:21:14.996 --> 02:21:20.675
...has a blonde wig.
she wears it at Paris.

02:21:21.075 --> 02:21:26.674
but she's on hard drugs and turning tricks now.

02:21:28.794 --> 02:21:32.673
She looks very good
in her blonde wig...

02:21:33.673 --> 02:21:35.472
just like a movie star.

02:21:35.592 --> 02:21:38.672
Even girls fall in love with her.

02:21:38.872 --> 02:21:43.071
When she's looking so good...

02:21:43.871 --> 02:21:47.991
In her blonde star wig

02:21:48.271 --> 02:21:52.589
She blows kisses and loves

02:21:52.669 --> 02:21:58.788
But she has got a hole in her vagina wall

02:22:00.588 --> 02:22:05.468
She has torn a hole

02:22:06.388 --> 02:22:08.467
... into her intestine

02:22:08.587 --> 02:22:10.867
... from her vagina.

02:22:10.987 --> 02:22:11.786
Shit baby...

02:22:12.186 --> 02:22:15.585
you didn't tell us that shit...

02:22:17.065 --> 02:22:19.465
She has a shitty doctor,

02:22:19.585 --> 02:22:22.385
But it is too expensive.

02:22:24.584 --> 02:22:29.384
And now she knows her time has
run out.

02:22:31.783 --> 02:22:34.782
She scored a few more times,

02:22:35.862 --> 02:22:39.582
And then, like that,

02:22:39.582 --> 02:22:43.581
...she will stay at home, with her monkey.

02:22:43.861 --> 02:22:46.581
It has a pet monkey.

02:22:46.581 --> 02:22:51.659
This monkey shits everywhere,
But she doesn't care

02:22:52.179 --> 02:22:54.059
This monkey can scream.

02:22:54.179 --> 02:22:58.458
It screams like it in a horror movie.

02:23:05.178 --> 02:23:09.657
But there are those who are
good with animals.

02:23:11.256 --> 02:23:15.455
Who have a way with animals.

02:24:15.165 --> 02:24:17.845
It's ok..
You dying is all

02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:51.639
I'll show you the light now...

02:24:55.838 --> 02:24:59.238
It burns bright, for heaven.

02:25:03.837 --> 02:25:07.237
No more blue tomorrows.

02:25:14.235 --> 02:25:17.355
You goin high now love.

02:26:41.141 --> 02:26:42.220
And...

02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:45.820
And.. Print it!

02:26:50.019 --> 02:26:51.538
It was fantastic.

02:26:51.738 --> 02:26:56.138
Check the gate.
check the gate please!

02:27:15.014 --> 02:27:18.014
Lets go right now
for Nikki Grace.

02:27:18.534 --> 02:27:20.014
Nikki Grace, everybody.

02:27:20.134 --> 02:27:21.334
Bravo!

02:28:11.005 --> 02:28:12.725
What's a matter with Nikki.

02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:39.920
Nikki.

02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:41.920
Nikki.

02:28:50.199 --> 02:28:51.518
Nikki.

02:28:51.918 --> 02:28:54.318
You were wonderful.

02:30:42.979 --> 02:30:46.499
I guess after my son died,

02:30:46.779 --> 02:30:50.977
, I went into a bad time.

02:30:52.097 --> 02:30:57.377
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

02:30:57.497 --> 02:31:02.176
Watching it, like in a dark theater.

02:31:03.776 --> 02:31:07.695
before they bring the lights up.

02:31:18.173 --> 02:31:18.973
Hello?

02:31:19.493 --> 02:31:20.373
Yeah

02:31:21.493 --> 02:31:23.373
She's still here

02:31:24.972 --> 02:31:26.092
Yeah...

02:31:28.092 --> 02:31:29.692
He's around here someplace.

02:31:29.772 --> 02:31:31.371
That is right.

02:42:30.578 --> 02:42:32.858
Heather?

02:42:35.778 --> 02:42:37.378
Paul?

02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:20.740
Sweet...
