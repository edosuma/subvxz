WEBVTT

00:04.321 --> 00:07.291
(tender music playing)

00:07.357 --> 00:08.758
(soft chuckle)

00:12.362 --> 00:13.930
(sniffs)

00:13.963 --> 00:17.201
Ah, I found
some extra boxes.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.702
They were folded up
in the garage.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.271
Thank you, Julius.
Well done.

00:21.305 --> 00:22.706
His old UT sweatshirt.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.974
Yeah. Wore 'em every game day.

00:26.210 --> 00:28.178
(sniffs) Still smells like him.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.513
JULIUS: Hmm.

00:30.647 --> 00:33.217
You know what?
I am keeping this one.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.684
You know you can
keep all of them.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.820
Uh, no. No, no, no.

00:36.886 --> 00:38.788
Charles has been gone
more than a year,

00:38.822 --> 00:43.693
and it is time to just
make space for new things, so...

00:43.793 --> 00:45.395
Besides, if we donate them,

00:45.462 --> 00:48.031
then other people
can enjoy them.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.800
Yeah, my brother always
did like to give back.

00:52.202 --> 00:54.871
Hey. Did you want something?

00:54.971 --> 00:56.506
Hm?

00:56.573 --> 01:00.744
How about his favorite wingtips?

01:00.810 --> 01:04.148
Um, I'm more of
a vintage sneaker guy.

01:04.181 --> 01:06.150
Oh, stop.

01:06.183 --> 01:09.586
Half of your band's set
is old school standard.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.922
Here. Give 'em a shot.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.160
-Alright, let's do it.
-Alright.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.270
Oh, God, stop, stop. Stop!

01:26.336 --> 01:27.704
What are you doing?

01:27.771 --> 01:29.573
Savage. Give that to me.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.841
(both laughing)

01:31.908 --> 01:34.378
Show some respect for the shoe.

01:34.444 --> 01:35.412
JULIUS: Hmm.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.746
-Foot.
-Hmm.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.519
Uh-huh.
Here we go, Cinderfella.

01:42.586 --> 01:44.554
(both chuckle)

01:47.691 --> 01:50.194
There. It's perfect.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.699
I can probably
get the other one.

01:55.765 --> 01:58.768
-Yes!
-(both chuckle)

02:00.237 --> 02:02.406
*

02:02.472 --> 02:03.773
Alright.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.610
Yeah!

02:07.611 --> 02:09.279
-These are really great.
-Yeah.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.615
Got a gig coming up
at The Whiskey J this week.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.284
I might have to throw these
into the rotation.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.119
(chuckles) Good idea.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.722
You should come.

02:19.789 --> 02:22.125
-To the show?
-Yeah.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.327
I think you'd have fun.

02:24.728 --> 02:28.898
And you, ma'am,
deserve some fun.

02:28.932 --> 02:32.068
* You tell me
that you're leaving *

02:33.337 --> 02:36.240
* I can't believe it's true

02:36.273 --> 02:37.407
You should take the printer.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.343
No, you keep it.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.578
You need it
for your photography.

02:41.645 --> 02:43.079
That's very generous of you,
Freddie.

02:43.146 --> 02:45.682
* Without you

02:45.749 --> 02:47.083
And take the spatulas too.

02:47.150 --> 02:49.953
It's not like I'm gonna
need 'em for cereal.

02:50.019 --> 02:51.855
Then you should take the bowls.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.590
* Don't take your love

02:53.623 --> 02:55.158
Thanks.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.793
*

02:56.860 --> 02:58.428
* Away from me

02:58.462 --> 03:00.163
I should have
cooked for you more.

03:00.964 --> 03:02.165
I blew it.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.601
Don't do that.

03:04.668 --> 03:07.537
We agreed.
Nobody has to feel bad.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.506
It just didn't work out.
It's nobody's fault.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.342
* 'Cause if you go

03:12.442 --> 03:16.012
* Then I'll be blue

03:16.112 --> 03:19.115
* Breaking up is hard...

03:19.148 --> 03:20.317
So who takes Wingo?

03:22.786 --> 03:24.488
You bought him,
you should keep him.

03:24.554 --> 03:26.790
I bought him for you.

03:26.856 --> 03:29.993
I think it would just be hard
having him around.

03:31.728 --> 03:33.530
Maybe it's best
we just let him go.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.665
* And you kissed me

03:35.732 --> 03:37.467
Yeah. I think so too.

03:37.501 --> 03:39.836
* All through the night

03:40.470 --> 03:42.972
* Think of all

03:43.006 --> 03:47.076
* That we've been through

03:47.143 --> 03:51.881
* And breaking up
is hard to do *

03:51.981 --> 03:56.320
* They say that breaking up

03:56.353 --> 04:02.158
* Is hard to do

04:03.192 --> 04:05.028
* Now I know

04:06.330 --> 04:07.697
* I know...

04:07.764 --> 04:09.499
Wait! I changed my mind!

04:09.533 --> 04:12.369
-Changed your mind?
-Was that Wingo?

04:12.436 --> 04:13.670
You said you didn't want him.

04:13.703 --> 04:14.871
Of course, I want him.

04:14.938 --> 04:16.706
You bought him for me.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.042
* Now I know

04:19.108 --> 04:21.678
Oh, hey.
He didn't go down.

04:21.745 --> 04:22.779
He didn't go down?

04:22.846 --> 04:24.448
Yeah, he's wedged
between a pizza box.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.782
I can save him.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.518
Is that what you want?

04:28.585 --> 04:31.187
* That this is the end

04:32.389 --> 04:33.423
Can you reach him?

04:33.523 --> 04:35.191
FREDDIE:
Yeah. Almost.

04:35.258 --> 04:36.926
Oh! (screaming)

04:37.026 --> 04:38.628
Oh, my God, Freddie!

04:38.695 --> 04:39.696
Freddie!

04:39.763 --> 04:43.032
(theme music plays)

04:44.133 --> 04:46.403
He's over here.
Please hurry.

04:46.470 --> 04:47.804
I'm Owen. This is Tommy.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.205
Why don't you tell us
what happened?

04:49.238 --> 04:51.040
My friend Freddie,
he fell down the garbage chute

04:51.074 --> 04:52.476
from our apartment,
and now he's stuck.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.743
-Stuck where?
-ABIGAIL: In there.

04:53.810 --> 04:55.044
The trash compactor.

04:55.078 --> 04:56.145
Freddie,
the fire department's here.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.147
-It's gonna be okay.
-Get me outta here!

04:58.214 --> 04:59.916
-Which floor
is your apartment on?
-Second.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.951
I always tell the residents
don't reach into the trash chute

05:02.051 --> 05:03.319
but nobody ever listens.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.388
Are you the landlord?

05:04.421 --> 05:06.222
No, building manager.
Part-time. I'm Jimmy.

05:06.289 --> 05:08.625
Jimmy, how often does this
trash compactor activate?

05:08.725 --> 05:09.926
Every hour, on the hour.

05:09.993 --> 05:11.160
But I cut the building's power

05:11.227 --> 05:12.796
-as soon as I heard.
-Good thinking.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.130
Ma'am, why don't you go
with TK here?

05:14.230 --> 05:15.632
He's gonna check you out
while we work.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.900
OWEN: Listen, Freddie,
we're gonna get you out,

05:16.966 --> 05:19.235
but my friend Tommy
is gonna assess you first.

05:19.302 --> 05:20.904
FREDDIE:
How much of me can you even see?

05:20.937 --> 05:22.271
Well, enough to know

05:22.338 --> 05:24.140
that something sliced you
pretty good on the way down.

05:24.240 --> 05:24.974
Does it hurt?

05:25.074 --> 05:26.142
FREDDIE:
No, it just feels tickly.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.911
-That's bad, isn't it?
-No, no, no.

05:27.944 --> 05:29.278
You've been
upside down for a while.

05:29.345 --> 05:31.515
It's natural for things
to start to go numb.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.682
Yeah, the bleeding's not bad,

05:32.749 --> 05:34.250
but I can't rule out
a spinal injury.

05:34.283 --> 05:36.085
You're gonna have to
extract him very carefully.

05:36.152 --> 05:38.755
Alright, Marjan,
get a ladder and rubbish hook.

05:38.788 --> 05:40.089
Clean out the trash in there.

05:40.123 --> 05:42.291
When you say "in," you mean
in the, in the dumpster?

05:42.358 --> 05:44.260
Yeah, we need to get
a look at him from inside.

05:44.828 --> 05:46.630
Copy that, Cap.

05:46.696 --> 05:48.598
Glad you're
riding back in the firetruck

05:48.665 --> 05:50.099
and not the ambulance, you know.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.435
Nancy, I need you
to get your kit.

05:51.468 --> 05:53.803
You're going in with her.
We need a neuro check.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.271
I deserve that.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.808
(gags, coughs)

05:58.875 --> 06:00.276
OWEN:
So his leg is caught

06:00.343 --> 06:02.612
between a one-way door
and all this trash.

06:02.646 --> 06:03.713
Mateo, give me the drill.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.014
-We gotta take off this grate.
-Yup, yup.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.983
OWEN:
How's the dumpster
diving coming, Marjan?

06:07.050 --> 06:09.486
MARJAN:
Yup, just about
clearing the path, Cap.

06:10.487 --> 06:11.855
(Marjan and Nancy coughing)

06:16.493 --> 06:17.827
Alright.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.328
Path is clear.

06:19.395 --> 06:20.797
Go on in.

06:20.864 --> 06:22.298
Hey, Freddie. I'm Nancy.

06:22.365 --> 06:24.067
I'm just gonna
check you out, okay?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.168
Okay.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.205
(coughs)

06:33.510 --> 06:35.311
Cap, heart rate's in the 120s,

06:35.344 --> 06:37.481
pupils are
both equal and reactive.

06:37.547 --> 06:38.815
Copy that. Glad to hear it.

06:38.848 --> 06:39.983
You got lucky.

06:40.016 --> 06:41.918
All that trash
must have broken your fall.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.087
Lucky is not
how I feel right now.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.823
Alright, but do you feel
my hand on your leg?

06:46.856 --> 06:48.424
Yeah. Yeah.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.827
Alright, Captain, he's good
for extraction when you are.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.529
Copy that.
Mateo, get the K-12 ready.

06:52.596 --> 06:54.598
You're gonna cut him out
the minute I get this off.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.566
-(alarm blaring)
-Uh-oh.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.734
What the hell is that?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.869
I got a bad feeling about this.

06:59.936 --> 07:02.839
(compactor powers on)

07:02.906 --> 07:04.841
Cap, it's on.
The compactor's on.

07:04.874 --> 07:06.275
-What do we do?
-It's gonna crush me!

07:06.342 --> 07:07.076
-Freddie!
-No!

07:07.176 --> 07:08.344
You said you killed the power.

07:08.377 --> 07:09.245
I-I did. I--

07:10.747 --> 07:12.248
Wha... Oh, my God!

07:12.348 --> 07:14.851
Alright, I got
the emergency shutoff.

07:14.884 --> 07:16.019
Or maybe I don't.

07:16.052 --> 07:17.053
Cap, it's closing in on him.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.121
-What do we do?
-Oh, my God!

07:18.187 --> 07:20.456
Uh, use the Halligan!

07:20.524 --> 07:22.225
FREDDIE:
Please. Please!

07:22.291 --> 07:23.359
(Freddie yelps)

07:24.628 --> 07:26.530
It worked?
It worked!

07:26.596 --> 07:28.798
Clutch idea, Cap.
Thank you.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.366
Don't thank me, thank Han Solo.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.768
Get him out of there
any way you can.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.369
Alright, Freddie,
we're gonna pull, okay?

07:33.436 --> 07:34.771
Yes, please. Pull.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.372
-Two.
-One.

07:36.405 --> 07:37.941
(groaning)

07:39.943 --> 07:41.377
(alarm blaring)

07:41.444 --> 07:42.879
No! Please. Oh, God.

07:42.946 --> 07:44.447
(shouting)

07:45.248 --> 07:47.283
-(all shouting)
-MARJAN: No!

07:47.383 --> 07:48.818
FREDDIE (gasps):
Help! Please, help!

07:48.885 --> 07:50.554
(overlapping shouting)

07:50.620 --> 07:53.623
-(blaring stops)
-(yelps)

07:53.723 --> 07:55.124
Wh... Wh... What happened?

07:55.224 --> 07:56.926
It stopped.
(laughs)

07:56.993 --> 07:58.962
What did you guys do?

07:59.062 --> 08:00.564
I pulled the plug.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.735
That works.

08:05.769 --> 08:06.770
Hmm.

08:06.836 --> 08:08.638
I'm so sorry, Abigail.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.240
You're sorry?
Why are you sorry?

08:13.610 --> 08:15.478
I couldn't save Wingo.

08:17.614 --> 08:20.116
No. But you saved us.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.256
(laughter)

08:27.323 --> 08:28.524
MARLENE:
I have to tip my hat.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.594
I've never been able
to cajole my fiancé here

08:30.627 --> 08:32.929
to take more than
two bites of broccoli,

08:32.962 --> 08:34.430
and you got him
to clean his plate.

08:34.497 --> 08:36.265
Well, it never
tasted like this.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.935
-Oh. Watch it!
-(laughter)

08:38.968 --> 08:40.637
Grace, I'm gonna
have to steal this recipe.

08:40.704 --> 08:43.539
Excuse me for a minute,
but why are you assuming
it was just Grace?

08:43.607 --> 08:45.809
Actually, Marlene,
this was all Judd and Wyatt.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.010
But thank you, Mom.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.212
Okay, sorry, but since
when does my son know

08:49.278 --> 08:51.447
how to cook anything
without a microwave?

08:51.514 --> 08:54.818
Maybe since he started spending
a little QT with his old man.

08:54.884 --> 08:56.953
If that's the case,
then I hope he continues

08:56.986 --> 08:58.554
to follow
in your footsteps, sir.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.123
Even if they are one-legged.

09:00.189 --> 09:01.190
-Oh!
-(laughter)

09:01.290 --> 09:03.026
Wow, too soon. Too soon.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.460
(cell phone chimes)

09:06.495 --> 09:08.031
Uh-oh.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.733
MARLENE:
Wyatt, what is it?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.735
It's from Tele-Lively.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.402
Tele-what-what-ly now?

09:13.469 --> 09:16.840
It's a big internship
Wyatt was hoping to get
this summer.

09:16.906 --> 09:18.041
-(sighs)
-MARLENE: Oh, no.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.542
What, they-they
don't have a slot?

09:19.643 --> 09:22.311
No, they wanna interview me,
but they changed the job

09:22.345 --> 09:24.013
from being remote to in-person.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.815
I mean, I can't
afford an apartment

09:25.882 --> 09:27.316
for an unpaid internship.

09:27.383 --> 09:28.918
Do you know where
the company's located?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.887
Uh, yeah, it's Austin.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.222
Austin? It's in Austin?

09:34.891 --> 09:36.826
Why don't you just stay here?

09:36.860 --> 09:38.895
No. No, I couldn't impose.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.563
GRACE:
Wyatt, that's nonsense.

09:40.664 --> 09:41.665
This is your home too.

09:41.698 --> 09:42.531
But, like, right here it says

09:42.598 --> 09:44.834
there's five other finalists
for this.

09:44.868 --> 09:47.170
And I'm sure they're all like,
you know, Mensa members.

09:47.203 --> 09:48.371
-Oh, come on.
-And the interview

09:48.437 --> 09:50.106
is with Max Keller himself.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.675
You said Max Killer?

09:51.708 --> 09:53.009
No, Kel... Keller.

09:53.076 --> 09:54.844
Max Keller
made his first billion

09:54.911 --> 09:56.245
by the time he was 25.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.413
-Is that right? (whistles)
-MARLENE: Mm-hmm.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.182
Trust me,
we've heard all about it.

09:59.248 --> 10:01.550
Yeah, and he's been on
the cover of WIRED twice.

10:01.617 --> 10:03.853
I just always choke
for these interviews.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.088
Wyatt, that is not true.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.455
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna cancel.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.058
Well, hang on a minute now.
No, no, no, no.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.527
No son of mine
is going back to Waco

10:11.594 --> 10:13.196
with his tail tucked
between his legs

10:13.229 --> 10:15.531
because of some tech guy,
alright?

10:15.564 --> 10:16.365
I got some time off.

10:16.432 --> 10:17.901
Me and you
are gonna work together,

10:17.967 --> 10:19.135
we'll get you in fightin' shape,

10:19.202 --> 10:20.603
so you go in there,
you whoop that interview.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.538
-We are?
-Hell, yeah.

10:22.571 --> 10:24.140
Um, and how exactly

10:24.207 --> 10:25.742
do you plan
on doing that, sweetheart?

10:25.809 --> 10:27.576
(scoffs)

10:27.643 --> 10:31.114
(stammers) Well...
There's a multi-phase process,

10:31.214 --> 10:33.149
and the first step
is to get your...

10:33.817 --> 10:35.118
uh...

10:36.285 --> 10:37.821
Get the proper attire.

10:48.765 --> 10:50.599
Hey, roomie. You up?

10:52.501 --> 10:54.070
Yeah, what's up, Cap?
You need something?

10:54.137 --> 10:56.172
Yeah, I made some golden milk.
You want some?

10:56.239 --> 10:58.007
MATEO: Oh, yeah.
That'd be great, Cap.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.843
Uh, just leave it in the fridge.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.177
The fridge?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.611
Golden milk gets way less golden

11:02.678 --> 11:04.613
and more brackish
when it's cold.

11:04.680 --> 11:05.448
MATEO: I like it cold.

11:05.514 --> 11:07.416
OWEN:
Alright, suit yourself.

11:07.450 --> 11:09.018
I'll just leave it
on the counter. I'm out.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.319
Thanks, Cap.

11:12.188 --> 11:14.690
-Do you think he knows?
-Nah.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.260
I mean, the walls are thin here,
but not that thin.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.931
How much noise
did we make last night?

11:21.965 --> 11:23.767
A little more than last time.

11:27.270 --> 11:32.141
You know, at some point,
we're gonna get busted.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.476
We're ninjas.

11:33.542 --> 11:35.444
Sooner or later,
we're gonna slip up,

11:35.511 --> 11:36.813
and then it's gonna be weird.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.147
And we promised

11:38.214 --> 11:40.316
that we're not gonna
let this get weird.

11:40.383 --> 11:43.987
Maybe it's time we just
came out and told everybody.

11:44.053 --> 11:45.621
But wouldn't that
make things weirder?

11:45.688 --> 11:46.956
Maybe.

11:47.023 --> 11:49.458
But less weird
than getting caught.

11:49.525 --> 11:50.827
But what if
it becomes a problem?

11:50.894 --> 11:53.329
I mean, you know,
officially seeing each other,

11:53.396 --> 11:54.530
working under the same roof?

11:54.630 --> 11:56.966
Yeah, same roof,
but two different captains

11:57.033 --> 11:58.567
who are both totally cool.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.836
True that.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.340
So, what do you say?

12:04.407 --> 12:08.812
Should we go in today
and rip off that Band-Aid?

12:09.512 --> 12:10.513
Today?

12:10.579 --> 12:12.315
Unless you can think
of a reason to wait.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.317
I mean, maybe we should
go get some coffee first,

12:14.383 --> 12:16.719
strategize about
how we're gonna do it.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.753
Going to get coffee

12:17.821 --> 12:19.923
is what got us into this
in the first place.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.424
That was some
good coffee, though.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.160
It was some great coffee.

12:24.227 --> 12:25.895
Mateo, we don't
have to overthink this.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.164
We just go up and
tell 'em we like each other.

12:28.197 --> 12:30.533
-It's not a big deal.
-Right.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.602
Unless you feel differently.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.405
I like you, Nancy.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.907
You do?

12:38.007 --> 12:39.208
Yeah.

12:40.276 --> 12:42.345
A lot, actually.

12:43.412 --> 12:45.014
So I guess we're doing this.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.683
Uh, I...

12:47.750 --> 12:49.685
I-I guess we are. Yeah.

12:50.954 --> 12:53.422
*

13:02.198 --> 13:03.699
TAILOR:
Arms down, please.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.236
Seventeen shoulder,

13:07.303 --> 13:09.805
but we'll allow
a little room to grow.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.708
So, do you think
we'll be looking at something

13:12.775 --> 13:15.144
single-breasted
or double-breasted today?

13:15.211 --> 13:18.447
Oh, um...
I don't... I don't know.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.583
How many breasts
would you recommend?

13:20.649 --> 13:23.119
Single-breasted
would be great, sir.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.054
Excellent.
I'll pull some options.

13:25.121 --> 13:26.389
Great.

13:27.156 --> 13:28.457
Hey.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.226
What the hell was that?

13:30.293 --> 13:32.328
What? I've never
bought a suit before.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.729
Also, I-I still don't even think

13:33.762 --> 13:35.664
I'm supposed to
wear one to this.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.167
First of all, you wear a suit
to a job interview.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.903
That's what you do.
Everybody knows that.

13:39.969 --> 13:43.572
Did you wear a suit when you had
an interview at the firehouse?

13:43.606 --> 13:46.175
No, I didn't, but that wasn't
for no office job, Wyatt.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.177
I'm-I'm not talking
about the suit.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.579
I'm talking about you
um'ing and oh'ing

13:50.613 --> 13:53.082
and, you know,
mopping the floor up
with your eyes

13:53.149 --> 13:55.251
while that man asked you
a simple question.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.086
I don't know.
It's just how I talk.

13:57.153 --> 13:58.988
Well, we gotta fix that.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.123
How?

14:00.189 --> 14:01.590
Put your shoulders back.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.626
Put your head up.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.995
Like this?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.296
(Wyatt chuckles)

14:07.363 --> 14:08.764
I don't know,
this feels forced.

14:08.797 --> 14:10.133
And then when you talk
to somebody,

14:10.199 --> 14:11.467
you look a man
square in his eyes

14:11.534 --> 14:13.669
so he knows that
you're worthy of his attention.

14:15.504 --> 14:19.976
Well, what if I'm not sure
that I am?

14:20.043 --> 14:24.480
Hey, so you get to decide
whether you're worthy or not.

14:24.547 --> 14:26.215
You wanna know
what the big secret is?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.317
What?

14:28.384 --> 14:31.120
Either way you choose,
you're right.

14:34.523 --> 14:36.993
Hang on.
Let's try it.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.530
So, where do we want to start?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.667
We've got navy, charcoal gray.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.471
I would like to try the navy.

14:49.238 --> 14:50.506
Very good, sir.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.342
Also the charcoal, please.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.981
Wyatt, that's-that's
too much eye contact.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.648
Sorry.

14:59.715 --> 15:02.151
So, he-he's doing great,
isn't he?

15:02.185 --> 15:03.519
Doing great, sir.

15:05.721 --> 15:07.156
I got winner.
I got winner.

15:07.190 --> 15:09.192
Hey, yo, the chili's ready!

15:09.258 --> 15:13.396
We got sour cream, we got
green onions, we got cheese.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.763
-Come and get you some.
-Yes!

15:14.830 --> 15:17.166
Hey, uh, anybody seen
the corn chips?

15:17.233 --> 15:19.268
Corn chips? I hid 'em.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.337
-You hid them? Why?
-Yep?

15:21.370 --> 15:23.039
Because I do not want you
defacing my chili

15:23.106 --> 15:24.407
with corn chips, man.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.574
What is it with
everyone in Texas

15:25.674 --> 15:27.210
putting corn chips
in their chili anyway?

15:27.276 --> 15:28.877
Because it is amazing.

15:30.546 --> 15:32.848
Alright, they're in the cabinet
over there.

15:32.915 --> 15:35.018
-First one? Ha-ha!
-Yeah, top shelf.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.420
Oh.

15:38.387 --> 15:39.622
Come on.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.693
Thanks.

15:45.561 --> 15:48.531
So, shall we do the thing?

15:49.232 --> 15:50.566
The thing?

15:52.601 --> 15:54.970
That we said we were gonna do?

15:55.038 --> 15:57.406
Tell the gang about us.

15:57.473 --> 15:59.608
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

16:00.443 --> 16:01.877
Yeah, um...

16:01.910 --> 16:03.146
What about Judd?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.613
What about Judd?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.083
I mean, it just
wouldn't feel right

16:07.150 --> 16:08.051
if we did it without him.

16:08.084 --> 16:10.553
He's at home
recovering from a leg injury

16:10.619 --> 16:12.488
that is literally gonna
take months to heal.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.391
He can find out
about it on IG.

16:15.424 --> 16:17.393
But he's not on social.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.828
Dude, we doing this or not?

16:20.629 --> 16:22.098
Of course, we are.

16:22.165 --> 16:23.499
Oh, look, there's Carlos.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.069
Carlos! Hey! What's up, man?

16:27.070 --> 16:28.637
Hey. Mateo.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.906
How are you, brother?
What brings you here?

16:30.973 --> 16:33.509
Uh, I heard there was
a Code Seven on the premises.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.578
Code seven? What's a Code Seven?
I'd like to know.

16:35.644 --> 16:37.946
Code Seven's cop talk for lunch.

16:38.013 --> 16:39.515
-I heard there was chili.
-Oh, yeah.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.849
Yeah, well, that's true.

16:40.916 --> 16:44.087
-Right there. Grab a bowl.
-Thank you.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.756
Hey, you ever try
corn chips with the chili?

16:47.790 --> 16:49.925
I'm from Texas. I only eat
chili with corn chips.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.495
-(Mateo grunts)
-Come on, Carlos.
Not you too.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.430
It just gives it like a,
you know, a nice crunch, right?

16:54.463 --> 16:57.032
That's what I was
tryin' to tell 'em,
like there should be--

16:57.100 --> 16:59.001
-Mateo?
-Yeah?

16:59.102 --> 16:59.935
(bell ringing)

17:00.002 --> 17:01.637
DISPATCHER:
Rescue 126 respond.

17:01.704 --> 17:02.938
Cardiac arrest...

17:03.005 --> 17:04.039
Sounds like medical.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.274
Yeah.

17:05.308 --> 17:06.609
Nance, heart attack, let's go.

17:06.642 --> 17:08.444
Right behind you.

17:08.511 --> 17:10.179
(ringing continues)

17:18.020 --> 17:19.622
-(whooping)
-(indistinct chatter)

17:19.655 --> 17:21.790
-(laughter)
-You guys feel it?

17:21.857 --> 17:23.126
That momentum gathering up

17:23.159 --> 17:24.693
as I prepare to squash you
like Juggernaut.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.495
Uh-huh. Okay, just hurry up
and roll already.

17:26.562 --> 17:27.630
Come on, nine, come on, nine.

17:27.696 --> 17:29.465
BOTH:
No nine, no nine. No nine.

17:29.532 --> 17:30.633
No nine, no nine!

17:30.699 --> 17:32.135
(playful shouting)

17:32.168 --> 17:35.471
Nine! I'm about to be
rollin' in it, baby!

17:35.538 --> 17:39.708
Okay, so that is
some golden-ass wheat

17:39.808 --> 17:42.145
and some rock-sturdy lumber.

17:42.211 --> 17:43.746
So who's gonna hook
a player up with some brick?

17:43.812 --> 17:45.648
For the love
of all things holy, guys,

17:45.714 --> 17:47.483
please do not
trade him a brick.

17:47.516 --> 17:48.651
No, forget it, Marjan, okay?

17:48.684 --> 17:49.818
There's no stopping this whole

17:49.852 --> 17:52.755
Chavez-Gillian war machine.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.157
Nance?

17:54.190 --> 17:55.691
Swap you a wheat for a brick?

17:56.559 --> 17:58.261
-Sorry, dude.
-CARLOS: Oh!

17:58.327 --> 17:59.728
Denied.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.931
But you have a settlement
on two brick hexes.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.000
I mean, you don't have
a single brick to spare?

18:05.033 --> 18:06.235
Nope.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.570
-Ooh!
-(laughter)

18:07.670 --> 18:09.172
-Shaking things up.
-PAUL: Swing and a miss!

18:09.238 --> 18:10.506
Things is different.

18:10.539 --> 18:13.709
Marjan, would you be
willing to trade

18:13.776 --> 18:15.778
an ore for a brick?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.181
Aah! Nancy,
I would be delighted.

18:18.214 --> 18:19.348
What the hell, Nance?

18:19.415 --> 18:20.749
You just told me
you didn't have a brick.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.352
No, I said I wouldn't
trade you a brick.

18:23.419 --> 18:24.620
-TK: Oh!
-CARLOS: Plot twist!

18:24.687 --> 18:27.055
-I thought we had an alliance.
-Did you now?

18:27.122 --> 18:29.057
Yeah, because we always have
an alliance playing Catan.

18:29.124 --> 18:30.759
That's why I gave you
all my grain.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.029
And I enjoyed
your grain very much.
Thank you.

18:34.062 --> 18:36.599
PAUL:
Yo, Nancy is coldblooded!

18:36.699 --> 18:38.201
I love it. I love it!

18:38.267 --> 18:39.902
-TK: Paul, can you
grab me a water?
-Yep.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.404
-That's so messed up.
-What's messed up?

18:41.470 --> 18:43.138
I mean, if you're gonna
call off a standing alliance,

18:43.206 --> 18:44.773
you should at least
let the other person know.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.108
Is that how it works?
Because I thought

18:46.209 --> 18:47.976
that you just didn't
say anything at all

18:48.043 --> 18:49.712
and just let the other person
figure it out.

18:49.745 --> 18:50.713
Yeah, if you're a betrayer.

18:50.779 --> 18:51.747
-MARJAN: Oh.
-PAUL: Dang.

18:51.814 --> 18:53.482
-MARJAN: Wow.
-TK: Alright, y'all.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.950
Why don't we all
just take a deep breath

18:55.050 --> 18:57.586
'cause it's getting a little
overheated in here, yeah?

18:57.653 --> 18:59.422
CARLOS: Yep. You guys,
you withhold in Catan.

18:59.488 --> 19:01.390
You know,
that's how the game goes.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.659
-Whatever. I fold.
-You can't fold.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.561
This is Catan.
This isn't poker.

19:05.594 --> 19:07.563
Well, either way,
I'm just gonna peace out.

19:07.630 --> 19:08.931
-TK: Mateo?
-CARLOS: Bro.

19:08.997 --> 19:11.166
-PAUL: Hey, come on, man.
-See you guys.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.736
-You really that salty?
-TK: He, he left.

19:15.304 --> 19:17.139
What the hell was that about?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.074
No clue. Hmm.

19:21.610 --> 19:24.747
* You give your hand to me

19:26.081 --> 19:28.351
* And then you say hello

19:29.918 --> 19:33.356
* And I can hardly speak

19:34.523 --> 19:37.626
* My heart is beating so

19:37.693 --> 19:41.129
* And anyone can tell

19:42.465 --> 19:45.268
* You think you know me well

19:46.435 --> 19:50.639
* But you don't know me

19:55.278 --> 19:59.715
* Now I never knew

19:59.782 --> 20:03.185
* The art of making love

20:03.286 --> 20:07.390
* Though my heart
aches with love *

20:07.456 --> 20:09.392
* For you

20:12.395 --> 20:15.564
* Afraid and shy

20:15.631 --> 20:19.802
* I let my chance go by

20:19.868 --> 20:25.908
* A chance that you
might love me too *

20:27.042 --> 20:30.679
* No, you don't know the one

20:31.747 --> 20:35.217
* Who dreams of you
each night *

20:35.318 --> 20:39.888
* And longs
to kiss your lips *

20:39.988 --> 20:43.359
* And longs
to hold you tight *

20:43.426 --> 20:46.929
* To you, I'm just a friend

20:47.996 --> 20:50.933
* That's all I've ever been

20:52.000 --> 20:55.738
* 'Cause you don't know me

20:58.341 --> 21:01.276
(vocalizing)

21:01.344 --> 21:04.780
* You don't know me

21:07.182 --> 21:08.617
Oh. (laughs)

21:08.684 --> 21:11.253
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.389
I thought your band
had an after party.

21:13.456 --> 21:18.427
Uh, we did, and I couldn't
get out of there fast enough.

21:18.527 --> 21:22.631
Well, you... you were amazing.
Amazing tonight.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.368
Well, inspiration is everything.

21:25.401 --> 21:26.435
Hmm.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.816
Mm, mm!
No. Are you crazy? No.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.150
The-the girls.

21:42.951 --> 21:44.587
Well, the girls and I...

21:44.653 --> 21:46.722
Uh... (sighs)

21:46.789 --> 21:48.424
I think I am crazy.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.828
I'm crazy too.

22:04.807 --> 22:06.341
Hello, husband.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.846
Ah!

22:10.913 --> 22:12.815
It has been a hell of a year.

22:13.949 --> 22:16.251
But that's not
exactly new, is it?

22:16.284 --> 22:20.756
Your daughters
are doing so well.

22:20.823 --> 22:22.758
They just had a birthday.

22:22.791 --> 22:25.428
Eleven.

22:25.494 --> 22:29.798
So you, um, you'll never guess
who's been staying with us

22:29.865 --> 22:32.100
these last few weeks.

22:32.968 --> 22:35.203
Their Uncle Julius.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.941
I know. I'm just
as surprised as you are.

22:39.708 --> 22:41.710
But I think he's changed.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.946
Or maybe I've changed. I...

22:45.213 --> 22:48.283
You always saw
something special in him.

22:48.350 --> 22:49.518
And you were right.

22:51.654 --> 22:52.955
I...

22:53.956 --> 22:55.991
feel alive today.

22:57.860 --> 23:01.296
(inhales and exhales deeply)

23:02.998 --> 23:06.334
Charles, I'm thinking
of asking him to stay.

23:06.401 --> 23:08.571
Just to see
where this goes. I...

23:10.005 --> 23:11.674
I want to ask for your blessing,

23:11.740 --> 23:15.644
but I feel in my heart

23:15.678 --> 23:17.580
that you've already
given it to us.

23:19.047 --> 23:21.316
Feels like you've had
your hand in this

23:21.984 --> 23:24.386
guiding him to us.

23:24.487 --> 23:28.323
Taking care of us
from wherever you are.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.095
I love you, baby.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.103
Always.

23:49.678 --> 23:50.713
TK: Morning, Nance.

23:50.779 --> 23:52.781
Hey, bud.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.017
-Feeling any better today?
-Feeling better?

23:55.083 --> 23:57.019
When was I supposed
to have felt worse?

23:57.085 --> 24:00.022
You know, after last night
when you and Mateo got into it.

24:00.088 --> 24:02.424
Oh, that. That was nothing.

24:03.258 --> 24:04.727
Didn't feel like nothing.

24:04.793 --> 24:06.929
Actually, it got kinda weird.

24:07.930 --> 24:11.299
Fine. Maybe it was
slightly weird.

24:12.635 --> 24:14.603
I think we're both just over it.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.939
Over it? Over what?

24:21.409 --> 24:22.545
Catan.

24:22.611 --> 24:24.246
We're both over Catan.

24:24.312 --> 24:25.380
Over Catan?

24:25.413 --> 24:27.783
But that's like
our national pastime, Nance.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.051
And to be honest,
I'm starting to find

24:29.084 --> 24:30.318
the whole thing a little goofy.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.120
Why do we never play
any other games?

24:32.220 --> 24:36.424
Hasn't anybody ever heard
of Yahtzee or Scattergories?

24:36.491 --> 24:37.893
Yeah, I-I guess.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.427
Look, if it's
that important to you,

24:39.494 --> 24:42.497
I will talk to the gang
about trying something new.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.499
I think it'd be good for
all of us to change things up.

24:44.567 --> 24:45.934
Spice of life.

24:46.001 --> 24:48.236
Catan is spicy.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.076
Where are we going?

24:54.142 --> 24:55.678
To see your Aunt Janie.

24:55.744 --> 24:56.845
-Is Daddy coming?
-CONNIE: No.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.346
Daddy has to work.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.982
(car starts)

25:00.082 --> 25:01.283
(exhales)

25:01.784 --> 25:03.018
(sighs)

25:06.521 --> 25:08.256
(cell phone ringing)

25:10.593 --> 25:12.995
(softly): Oh, no.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.296
-Hi, babe.
-ROD (over phone):
Why did you just

25:14.362 --> 25:16.264
take four grand
out of the bank?

25:16.298 --> 25:17.532
I got a notification.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.334
You remember that new
patio set I showed you?

25:19.434 --> 25:21.103
Mommy, I forgot Purple Llama.

25:21.169 --> 25:22.204
ROD: Was that Toby?

25:22.270 --> 25:24.873
Why isn't he in school?

25:24.940 --> 25:27.209
Connie, what in the hell
is going on?

25:27.275 --> 25:29.612
I'll get Purple Llama.
You stay still.

25:29.645 --> 25:32.014
ROD:
Connie, answer me!

25:32.114 --> 25:33.849
-Connie!
-Mommy'll be back.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.284
ROD:
Connie, talk to me! Connie!

25:36.318 --> 25:37.720
The kids and I won't be here
when you get back.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.022
I'm not letting you lay
another hand on them ever again.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.725
-Mommy? Mommy!
-Oh, God!

25:42.791 --> 25:43.959
-Oh, God!
-Mommy!

25:44.026 --> 25:45.193
Oh, no!

25:45.293 --> 25:46.829
-Oh, God!
-Mommy!

25:46.895 --> 25:48.063
No, no, no, no, no!

25:48.130 --> 25:50.298
-Oh, God, no!
-Mommy, help!

25:50.365 --> 25:51.634
-Mommy!
-No!

25:51.700 --> 25:53.068
No, no, no!

25:53.135 --> 25:55.037
-God! No!
-Mommy!

25:57.139 --> 25:59.141
Ah! Oh, no, no, no!

26:08.751 --> 26:10.318
(sirens blaring)

26:13.188 --> 26:14.556
Mom's name is Connie Allen.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.524
Kids were in the car
when it started to roll.

26:16.591 --> 26:18.326
She threw herself
underneath to stop it.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.062
NANCY:
She used her own body
as a speed bump?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.665
Alright, chock the wheels,
cribbing and an airbag.

26:22.731 --> 26:23.932
(groans weakly)

26:23.999 --> 26:25.600
Check on the kids.
Make sure they're okay.

26:25.668 --> 26:28.036
-TK: Copy, Cap.
-(groaning)

26:28.103 --> 26:30.538
Ma'am, we'll get you
outta here in no time, okay?

26:30.605 --> 26:31.373
My kids.

26:31.439 --> 26:33.108
You have to get them
out of here.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.176
Your kids are
being taken care of.

26:34.242 --> 26:35.678
They can't see
what's happening.

26:35.711 --> 26:38.080
No. I mean, he's coming.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.748
You can't let him...

26:40.716 --> 26:41.850
(Connie cries)

26:41.917 --> 26:43.618
Alright, first things first.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.553
Nancy, get her vitals.

26:45.620 --> 26:46.689
She's terrified.

26:46.722 --> 26:49.692
Pulse is 90, BP's 140 over 80.
Lungs sound clear.

26:49.725 --> 26:52.560
Okay, start a line.
Push ten milligrams
of morphine for the pain.

26:52.627 --> 26:55.698
-Copy
-Alright, guys,
let's raise her up.

26:55.731 --> 26:57.465
TOMMY:
Alright, as soon as she's clear,
we're gonna pull her

26:57.532 --> 26:59.935
onto the backboard
and on the gurney.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.270
-We're clear.
-TOMMY: Now.

27:03.706 --> 27:05.540
Nice and easy. Alright.

27:06.742 --> 27:08.243
Here we go.

27:08.811 --> 27:09.912
Perfect.

27:09.978 --> 27:11.780
Nancy, let's get
these legs splinted
for transport.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.549
-(screeching)
-ROD: Connie!

27:15.150 --> 27:16.384
Oh, God, no.

27:16.952 --> 27:17.920
No.

27:17.986 --> 27:19.321
-Your ex?
-CONNIE: Not yet.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.589
You can't let him near my kids.

27:23.458 --> 27:24.492
Connie!

27:25.560 --> 27:26.394
Is she alright?

27:26.461 --> 27:27.462
OWEN:
Your wife's been in an accident

27:27.562 --> 27:29.631
and, uh, we're assessing her.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.399
Toby, Sammy, come with me.

27:31.466 --> 27:34.436
No, He hits us! He hits me.

27:34.502 --> 27:36.404
We were trying to get away.

27:37.973 --> 27:39.574
-She's delirious.
-No!

27:39.607 --> 27:41.076
Connie, I need you
to settle back.

27:41.143 --> 27:42.911
Your kids were involved
in the accident as well,

27:42.945 --> 27:43.946
so they need to be assessed.

27:44.012 --> 27:45.413
Those are my kids,

27:45.480 --> 27:46.782
and they're coming home with me.

27:46.849 --> 27:48.751
Captain Strand, this patient
needs to be transported.

27:48.817 --> 27:51.086
No, I'm not leaving.

27:51.119 --> 27:53.255
No, no, no, no...

27:53.321 --> 27:54.456
What do we do here, officer?

27:54.522 --> 27:57.359
ROD:
You can let me take my kids.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.328
Ma'am, have you reported
any incident of domestic abuse?

28:01.429 --> 28:04.099
No. I've always been too afraid.

28:04.132 --> 28:06.168
Because nothing
ever happened.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.602
Legally,
there is nothing I can do.

28:07.669 --> 28:08.636
He's their father.

28:08.703 --> 28:10.773
I'm required
to give them back to him.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.009
CONNIE:
Please!

28:14.109 --> 28:16.444
(cries) Please!

28:16.511 --> 28:17.545
OWEN: Hey!

28:18.981 --> 28:20.648
-Owen.
-Cap.

28:20.715 --> 28:21.817
Dad.

28:21.884 --> 28:22.951
(exhales)

28:24.219 --> 28:26.288
Hulk smash.

28:26.354 --> 28:29.291
I'm taking my kids with me.

28:29.357 --> 28:32.694
Yeah. Um, are you sure
they are your kids?

28:32.795 --> 28:35.730
'Cause they don't bear
much of a resemblance.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.399
And it's got me thinking...

28:39.067 --> 28:40.235
when was the last time

28:40.302 --> 28:42.537
a wife-beating cuck
like you, actually--

28:43.906 --> 28:46.141
Officer, would you
do me the honor of arresting

28:46.174 --> 28:47.843
-this man for assault?
-With pleasure.

28:47.910 --> 28:50.012
Sir, I need you to put
your hands behind your back.

28:50.078 --> 28:51.379
You baited me. Ow!

28:51.479 --> 28:53.315
CARLOS: You're being
arrested for assault. Let's go.

28:53.348 --> 28:55.317
ROD: This is ridiculous.

28:55.350 --> 28:57.719
Toby, Sammy, I'll be right back.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.687
Don't worry.
No one's taking your kids today.

28:59.754 --> 29:01.824
Thank you. Thank you.

29:01.857 --> 29:03.225
(exhales)

29:04.226 --> 29:05.994
-Well played, Cap.
-MATEO: For real.

29:06.028 --> 29:07.362
I thought you were
about to unleash

29:07.429 --> 29:09.497
the rage monster on that dude.

29:09.564 --> 29:10.999
I did.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.367
It just wasn't mine.

29:26.214 --> 29:27.549
How you feel?

29:28.250 --> 29:29.717
Like I'm gonna puke.

29:29.784 --> 29:30.853
Oh, that's natural.

29:30.886 --> 29:32.420
I mean, you look like
a million bucks.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.756
Just don't puke on your duds.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.624
Keep your shoulders back
and your chin up.

29:36.724 --> 29:38.894
And make
plenty of eye contact

29:38.927 --> 29:40.295
but not too much eye contact.

29:40.395 --> 29:41.796
That's the ticket.

29:41.897 --> 29:44.432
And don't forget,
he may be Max Keller,

29:45.233 --> 29:46.634
but you're Wyatt Harris.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.437
Hell, yeah, I am.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.738
I'd say break a leg, but--

29:50.772 --> 29:53.075
But you already
got that covered.

29:53.108 --> 29:55.410
-Get outta here, joker.
-(laughs)

30:04.619 --> 30:05.653
(whistles)

30:12.060 --> 30:13.095
(dings)

30:13.761 --> 30:14.796
(exhales)

30:22.070 --> 30:25.273
Hello. I'm, uh,
I'm here about the interview.

30:25.307 --> 30:27.309
You and everybody else.
Have a seat.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.610
He'll be out soon.

30:36.184 --> 30:37.452
(clears throat)

30:43.025 --> 30:47.095
If you take away anything
from today, Astrid, two words:

30:47.129 --> 30:48.696
ice baths.
It'll change your life.

30:48.796 --> 30:51.266
Hit me up any time on Discord.

30:51.299 --> 30:53.201
Skyler, who's my 3:15?

30:53.301 --> 30:54.769
-Wyatt Harris.
-MAX: Wyatt.

30:54.802 --> 30:58.106
Uh, which one of you
is Wyatt Harris?

31:00.775 --> 31:03.211
-That's me.
-MAX: Oh. Oh, wow.

31:03.311 --> 31:04.947
Did somebody die?

31:04.980 --> 31:07.215
Uh, no.

31:07.315 --> 31:09.484
Well, then you must
be hunting for Neo.

31:11.019 --> 31:14.056
Oh! Uh...

31:14.156 --> 31:15.223
No, yeah, that's funny

31:15.323 --> 31:17.459
'cause The Matrix...

31:17.492 --> 31:19.861
I'm Wyatt. Wyatt Harris.

31:21.229 --> 31:22.830
Uh-uh... Oh, wow.

31:22.864 --> 31:24.632
You got quite
the clammy grip there, Wyatt.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.669
Okay. Come on back.

31:31.339 --> 31:32.540
(sighs)

31:41.516 --> 31:42.717
(softly): Yeah.

31:50.192 --> 31:51.259
How'd you fare?

31:51.359 --> 31:53.095
Can we just go? Thanks.

31:55.197 --> 31:56.198
Yeah.

31:56.264 --> 31:57.565
(car starts)

32:05.207 --> 32:06.441
(knock on door)

32:07.509 --> 32:08.676
Sorry I'm late.

32:08.710 --> 32:11.246
Parking downtown
is such a quest.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.581
Believe me, I get it.
Come on in.

32:14.582 --> 32:18.253
Kids, I have Scattergories,

32:18.353 --> 32:22.057
Trouble, Pictionary.

32:22.124 --> 32:25.560
Why is there no music or food?

32:25.627 --> 32:28.063
Because this is a trap, Nancy.

32:28.130 --> 32:29.131
This whole hang was a trap.

32:29.231 --> 32:30.598
We're not playing
Scattergories?

32:30.698 --> 32:33.601
Yeah, we were never
playing Scattergories.

32:33.701 --> 32:34.936
And we never will.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.704
In this house, we Catan.

32:37.739 --> 32:40.575
Yeah. You-you can't
trash tradition, Nance.

32:41.643 --> 32:43.778
So, please have a seat.

32:49.551 --> 32:52.587
Now, what the hell's
going on between you two?

32:52.620 --> 32:55.257
Oh, my God, this is
getting ridiculous, okay?

32:55.290 --> 32:56.958
Nothing is going on between us.

32:57.059 --> 32:59.061
Yeah, it got
a little over-competitive
the other night,

32:59.094 --> 33:00.595
but it's not a big deal.

33:00.662 --> 33:03.398
You called Catan stupid,
that is a very big deal.

33:03.431 --> 33:06.468
So let's talk it out.

33:07.435 --> 33:08.803
Fine.

33:10.105 --> 33:12.640
Mateo and me, we...

33:14.008 --> 33:14.942
you know.

33:15.009 --> 33:16.444
-We don't know.
-We don't. We have no idea.

33:16.478 --> 33:18.280
-No idea.
-We asked you to talk about it.

33:20.282 --> 33:21.516
We knocked boots.

33:22.517 --> 33:23.785
ALL: Oh.

33:25.287 --> 33:26.488
Wow...

33:27.189 --> 33:28.623
Well, this is awkward.

33:28.690 --> 33:30.625
You don't need to talk
about this with us if...

33:30.692 --> 33:31.959
if y'all don't want to.

33:32.026 --> 33:34.829
Yeah, this is really,
really none of our business.

33:34.929 --> 33:37.799
We didn't mean to put you
in an awkward position.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.669
Not "position."

33:42.470 --> 33:43.505
-Who wants a snack?
-Me.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.972
Actually, you know what?

33:45.640 --> 33:47.475
It is your business.

33:47.509 --> 33:49.111
You made it their business.

33:50.044 --> 33:51.313
I didn't say a thing.

33:51.379 --> 33:53.715
No, but you got weird.

33:53.815 --> 33:57.819
The thing that we said
we were not gonna do, you did.

33:57.852 --> 33:59.954
You know, I just wanna
say for the record, okay,

33:59.987 --> 34:01.656
what happened
between Mateo and I,

34:01.689 --> 34:04.159
it was not weird
and it was not awkward.

34:04.226 --> 34:05.193
It was nice.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.630
It was two people
that like each other a lot

34:08.663 --> 34:10.998
who got together at a moment

34:11.065 --> 34:14.001
when neither of them
wanted to be alone.

34:14.068 --> 34:17.672
Although in this moment,
I kinda do.

34:19.006 --> 34:22.544
-Nance.
-You don't need
to say anything, Mateo.

34:22.644 --> 34:23.878
I'm a grown-ass woman,

34:23.978 --> 34:27.882
and I'm not asking
anything of you.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.184
It's cool.

34:29.251 --> 34:32.019
No harm, no foul. I'm over it.

34:32.053 --> 34:33.321
Well, I'm not.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.692
I don't regret anything.

34:37.759 --> 34:39.861
Well, then, what's
your problem, dude?

34:45.500 --> 34:46.734
This.

34:48.370 --> 34:50.338
This is my problem.

34:52.106 --> 34:55.042
I've always been taller
than you. That's not news.

34:55.076 --> 34:58.246
Yeah, well, I haven't
thought about it
until I thought about it.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.716
And then I started thinking
about where this is going

35:01.783 --> 35:02.950
and what people might say
if they saw us

35:03.050 --> 35:05.553
walking down
the street together.

35:05.587 --> 35:08.756
You're afraid of people
laughing at you?

35:08.856 --> 35:10.925
I'm afraid that they're
gonna laugh at you...

35:11.693 --> 35:13.561
for being with me.

35:13.595 --> 35:17.232
Mateo, I've been
the tallest kid in my class

35:17.265 --> 35:19.567
since third grade

35:19.601 --> 35:21.536
and at least a head taller

35:21.569 --> 35:24.071
than pretty much
anyone I've ever dated.

35:24.105 --> 35:26.441
Even if they're in
six-inch heels.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.877
I don't care what people think.

35:29.911 --> 35:31.613
And neither should you.

35:34.616 --> 35:35.783
We good now?

35:35.883 --> 35:37.652
Yeah, we're good.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.589
ALL: Aw!

35:41.656 --> 35:43.591
Okay! Who's for Catan?

35:43.658 --> 35:44.659
-Let's go.
-MARJAN: Whoo!

35:44.759 --> 35:45.760
(overlapping chatter)

35:45.827 --> 35:48.296
Beware of
the Gillian-Chavez alliance.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.431
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.098
Nance, Catan?

35:51.132 --> 35:54.302
Actually, you wanna
get a coffee?

35:55.670 --> 35:57.439
Oh, you...

35:57.472 --> 35:59.073
You-you want some coffee?

35:59.106 --> 36:00.975
I think so.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.977
Yeah, I-I want
some coffee too. I...

36:03.845 --> 36:05.146
-I love coffee.
-Alright.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.615
Um, hey, guys,
we're gonna go get a coffee.

36:07.649 --> 36:09.116
You're gonna go get coffee?

36:09.183 --> 36:10.585
We have coffee.

36:10.618 --> 36:12.520
Um, no, thanks, we're good.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.622
Alright. See you guys.

36:14.656 --> 36:15.923
NANCY:
Bye! Bye.

36:17.692 --> 36:20.094
(inhales and exhales)

36:20.127 --> 36:22.530
You still staring up
at the ceiling, aren't you?

36:22.630 --> 36:23.831
JUDD: Yeah.

36:27.635 --> 36:28.836
(Grace sighs)

36:32.507 --> 36:35.009
-Judd?
-(sighs)

36:35.109 --> 36:38.145
You can't keep
torturing yourself over this.

36:38.179 --> 36:41.816
What the hell do I know
about some office job interview?

36:41.883 --> 36:44.852
I sent that boy in there
dressed up like a damn banker.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.788
Well, I thought
he looked pretty good.

36:46.821 --> 36:48.956
Thought he looked sharp.
Thought he looked damn sharp.

36:48.990 --> 36:50.992
Every young man should have
at least one good suit.

36:51.058 --> 36:52.460
JUDD: Yeah,
the trouble ain't the suit.

36:52.494 --> 36:56.831
The trouble is, I did not
encourage him to go in there

36:56.864 --> 36:58.866
and just be himself.

37:00.034 --> 37:01.903
I threw him off his game.

37:02.003 --> 37:03.505
You were just
trying to help him.

37:03.538 --> 37:06.240
I was... but I didn't.

37:08.376 --> 37:09.477
But I'm gonna.

37:14.549 --> 37:16.351
(guitar music playing)

37:22.857 --> 37:25.026
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:27.762 --> 37:29.364
Where are the girls?

37:29.431 --> 37:32.099
Bundled off to Mrs. Beasley's.

37:32.199 --> 37:35.236
That sounds like the title
to a children's book.

37:35.337 --> 37:36.371
Or a song.

37:38.540 --> 37:39.741
TOMMY: Hmm.

37:41.543 --> 37:42.944
You know, it's, uh, it's good

37:43.044 --> 37:45.179
that we have
a minute to ourselves.

37:47.048 --> 37:48.182
Yeah.

37:48.215 --> 37:50.284
I've been thinking
a lot about you, Julius.

37:52.219 --> 37:56.190
You haven't left my thoughts...
at all.

37:56.223 --> 37:58.092
I know there are
a lot of complicated feelings

37:58.192 --> 38:00.061
around what happened between us.

38:00.094 --> 38:02.864
And, and I just want
you to know that I...

38:03.565 --> 38:04.899
I don't regret it.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.601
And I thought I might.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.070
I thought I might feel that I...

38:09.136 --> 38:12.907
I betrayed Charles
or-or his memory.

38:12.940 --> 38:15.543
But... that's untouched.

38:17.044 --> 38:21.449
No matter what happens,
that will always be untouched.

38:22.417 --> 38:23.885
And I know it now.

38:23.918 --> 38:26.153
I really know it now.

38:26.253 --> 38:27.822
And that's huge.

38:29.256 --> 38:30.558
And thank you.

38:31.926 --> 38:34.228
-I'm glad I could help.
-You did.

38:35.430 --> 38:36.498
It turns out...

38:37.599 --> 38:38.833
um...

38:39.934 --> 38:43.838
that I actually
really like you, Julius.

38:47.074 --> 38:50.445
You said something
about complicated feelings.

38:50.478 --> 38:51.513
Hmm.

38:52.614 --> 38:53.915
Mine aren't.

38:55.983 --> 38:57.284
I'm in love with you.

38:59.454 --> 39:00.488
What?

39:00.588 --> 39:01.923
In these last
couple of weeks,

39:01.956 --> 39:05.960
it's become
even more obvious to me.

39:07.194 --> 39:10.331
And that is why I have to go.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.035
Go?

39:14.135 --> 39:15.770
Before I screw this up,

39:15.803 --> 39:18.139
as I inevitably will,

39:18.172 --> 39:21.108
and... and everything
that has been repaired

39:21.142 --> 39:23.645
could end up being
broken again and just--

39:23.711 --> 39:26.814
Uh, that's the risk we take

39:26.881 --> 39:28.149
when we wake up every morning.

39:28.215 --> 39:30.652
My-my entire profession
is about that.

39:30.685 --> 39:31.953
I...

39:32.520 --> 39:33.688
(Julius sighs)

39:33.788 --> 39:35.523
I don't want to be an emergency

39:35.623 --> 39:37.024
you have to respond to.

39:38.325 --> 39:41.228
My... my brother's shoes
may be a perfect fit,

39:41.328 --> 39:44.999
but I am not near man enough
to fill them.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.469
Nobody's asking you to.

39:47.502 --> 39:50.705
Anything short of that
isn't good enough for you

39:50.805 --> 39:52.073
or the girls.

39:53.007 --> 39:54.842
My manager's been trying

39:54.909 --> 39:57.845
to book us some gigs
in New Orleans, and I've...

39:57.912 --> 39:59.981
I've been putting him off.

40:00.014 --> 40:03.050
But this morning I told him...

40:04.852 --> 40:06.153
"Pull the trigger."

40:08.656 --> 40:09.891
I see.

40:15.530 --> 40:16.531
(sighs)

40:22.103 --> 40:24.506
-Can you forgive me?
-Hmm.

40:27.108 --> 40:29.010
This time, Julius...

40:29.877 --> 40:31.445
there's nothing to forgive.

40:42.189 --> 40:45.092
Alright, round two.
Here we go.

40:45.192 --> 40:48.095
I don't know how you got me
another shot at this, but...

40:48.630 --> 40:50.297
Thanks, Dad.

40:50.397 --> 40:53.100
Well, Wyatt, you didn't mess
it up the first time, I did.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.237
And, uh, I ain't exactly
got you another shot yet.

40:57.238 --> 40:58.940
What are you talking about?

40:59.040 --> 41:00.474
Don't worry about it.
You sit tight here.

41:00.575 --> 41:01.543
I'm gonna go up there

41:01.576 --> 41:03.377
and have a conversation
with this Max feller

41:03.410 --> 41:05.079
and then I'll call you
when it's time to come up.

41:05.112 --> 41:07.414
Hold on. You haven't
spoken to him yet?

41:08.550 --> 41:09.817
You really think
you're just gonna waltz

41:09.917 --> 41:10.952
into Max Keller's office

41:11.052 --> 41:12.219
and have a conversation
with him?

41:12.253 --> 41:14.556
Yeah, that's pretty
much the idea.

41:15.389 --> 41:16.423
Watch this.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.259
(grunts)

41:22.463 --> 41:24.599
(jackhammering)

41:32.574 --> 41:35.009
-JUDD: Appreciate you.
-No problem.

41:40.948 --> 41:42.016
You report a gas leak?

41:42.116 --> 41:43.951
Yeah, folks have been
complaining

41:43.985 --> 41:45.820
of a rotten egg smell
in the lobby.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.988
-Just the lobby?
-Mostly.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.289
But then a gal
on the third floor

41:48.355 --> 41:50.491
started feeling lightheaded.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.026
Excuse me a second.

41:56.664 --> 41:57.932
Can I help you, son?

41:57.965 --> 42:00.301
Oh, um, I'm just
waiting for my dad.

42:00.334 --> 42:02.637
It's a 30-minute
loading zone, okay?

42:02.704 --> 42:03.771
Yeah, I'll move it soon.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.682
(sighs)

42:14.782 --> 42:15.817
Show me where the meter's at.

42:15.883 --> 42:17.451
-Basement. This way.
-Basement.

42:19.687 --> 42:21.155
Mechanical room's right here.

42:21.188 --> 42:23.324
Ninety-eight ppm and climbing.

42:23.390 --> 42:25.492
We shouldn't be down here.
We have to evacuate.

42:25.526 --> 42:27.061
(loud explosion)

42:37.338 --> 42:40.041
(car alarms wailing)

42:44.979 --> 42:46.480
(coughing)

42:51.919 --> 42:53.420
(coughing continues)

43:01.495 --> 43:03.397
DISPATCHER (over phone):
9-1-1. What's your emergency?
