WEBVTT

00:56.000 --> 00:58.350
Holy shit!

00:58.440 --> 01:00.080
You scared me to death, man!

01:00.170 --> 01:03.380
There's nothing down there.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.320
I think we're leaving empty-handed.

01:06.410 --> 01:08.820
This isn't about
how many fish we catch.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.720
It's about having a good time.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.500
Don't you just want to paddle
to Miami sometimes?

01:24.260 --> 01:27.300
What for?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.280
There, I have to work.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.240
Here, I'm a harvester
like the Tainos.

01:33.340 --> 01:34.840
It's just a matter of
sitting and waiting.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.340
Something will come up.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.190
Besides, I'm a survivor.

01:40.350 --> 01:45.460
I survived Mariel, I survived Angola,
I survived the Special Period,

01:45.620 --> 01:47.100
and that thing that came later.

01:47.250 --> 01:53.170
Just give me a chance,
and I'll sort it out.

01:53.330 --> 01:58.470
Look, my luck is getting better.
What did I tell you, Lazaro?

01:58.630 --> 02:03.140
This is paradise,
and nothing will change that.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.150
Is he dead?

02:34.230 --> 02:36.980
This stays between us, okay?

03:25.250 --> 03:26.630
Doesn't El Neni owe you money?

03:29.690 --> 03:32.670
What a bastard!
Here.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.710
Neni!

03:40.800 --> 03:42.710
- You're a sucker!
- Neni!

03:51.940 --> 03:53.750
My dad is better than you.

03:54.750 --> 03:55.850
Who's your dad?

03:57.380 --> 03:58.550
Pick that up. Come on!

03:58.650 --> 03:59.750
And count the chips.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.930
Your dad is a sodomite.

04:06.490 --> 04:10.170
- What's a sodomite?
- A chemical substance.

04:13.630 --> 04:16.610
- Can I help you, Yiya?
- Thank you, Sonny.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.850
Juanito, what would I do
without you?

04:21.940 --> 04:24.780
With Rogelio who hasn't stood up
for years!

04:25.680 --> 04:28.520
- Whoops!!
'Again!

04:33.190 --> 04:35.960
I'm going to lift you up, Yiya.
Careful.

04:36.050 --> 04:40.160
- Don't take advantage!
- I'll try not to.

04:40.330 --> 04:41.570
That's it.

04:41.730 --> 04:43.600
Now the other knee.

04:48.170 --> 04:51.010
Did you just touch my bum?

04:51.170 --> 04:53.450
I couldn't help myself.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.350
Hey! What's up, Sara?

05:02.450 --> 05:05.360
Listen, the other day,
you left the window open.

05:05.450 --> 05:07.290
What a sublime show.

05:07.450 --> 05:09.990
When he told me,
I had to touch myself.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.760
By the way,
you look good in those red shoes.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.530
Sara, what if you and I --?

05:15.630 --> 05:20.370
Please! You'd have to be
the last man on Earth.

05:24.100 --> 05:27.780
Those chicks
are crazy about me, man.

05:32.310 --> 05:34.380
How do these chicks know
when they're done?

05:34.480 --> 05:35.390
I'll tell you how.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.890
I jerk off, I come, and that's it.

05:36.980 --> 05:40.690
But their hands get tired,
and their tongues get numb.

05:43.090 --> 05:45.360
What does Sara do, man?

05:45.460 --> 05:47.940
She's a blogger.

05:48.030 --> 05:49.730
Oh...

05:51.530 --> 05:54.370
One of those people who write
nonsense on the Internet.

06:13.220 --> 06:19.000
JUAN OF THE DEAD

06:19.560 --> 06:23.030
You're getting your family
in trouble, and then you'll feel bad.

06:23.130 --> 06:23.900
Show me that watch, shit!

06:24.060 --> 06:28.370
Hey, you! What are you looking at?
Beat him up and shake him down.

06:29.030 --> 06:32.910
- There's a meeting today, right?
- I've already told them.

06:33.570 --> 06:35.480
Look, you have to get your kid
out of this.

06:35.570 --> 06:38.560
He should study something.
Not be a crook.

06:43.450 --> 06:45.590
That's it, California. That's my son.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.220
- Give it to her.
- Hey!

06:46.390 --> 06:49.460
He can do much better, man.
You can't let him follow our footsteps.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.570
He likes it, Juan.
What the hell can I do?

06:51.660 --> 06:52.800
What the hell do I know?

06:52.890 --> 06:53.840
You should've paid more
attention to him.

06:53.930 --> 06:56.810
Play ball with him more often.
I don't know.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.710
At least he's here with me, in Cuba.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.850
Wouldn't you like
to have been raised better?

07:08.940 --> 07:10.510
I don't complain about ourselves,

07:10.610 --> 07:13.890
but there are different ways
to move forward in life.

07:34.770 --> 07:37.250
What's up, Mommy-in-Law?
Did you miss me?

07:37.400 --> 07:40.180
Thank God it's been a long time
I haven't been your mother-in-law.

07:40.270 --> 07:42.250
Why did you come?
Camila isn't here.

07:42.410 --> 07:45.620
Grandma, who is it?

07:47.180 --> 07:50.390
- Come in.
- Thank you.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.730
I'm in the shower.
I'll be right there.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.690
I was surprised
you didn't come before.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.190
I thought you were in prison.

08:26.350 --> 08:29.660
- Why would I be in prison?
- Because nature is wise.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.230
Has it been a while
since you arrived?

08:31.390 --> 08:34.740
Too long for you
not to have known already.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.700
When you do that,
you steal my heart.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.500
The last time I saw you,
you stole many things from me.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.240
- You're just like your mother.
- Thank goodness I came out like her.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.510
Cami, I swear, I've changed.

08:48.470 --> 08:51.780
No, Juan, you're like this country.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.620
Many things happen to you,
but you never change.

08:54.710 --> 08:58.490
By the way, I'm going to Miami.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.330
Things aren't easy in Spain, and mom
has decided to start from scratch.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.830
Damn it, Camila,
you can't do this to me.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.090
I can't live without you.

09:05.190 --> 09:08.930
You've been doing pretty good
all this time, so get used to it.

09:09.030 --> 09:11.630
I'm being honest.

09:11.730 --> 09:12.970
Give me a chance.

09:15.970 --> 09:17.540
Leave.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.950
Let's go for a fifth time.

10:34.610 --> 10:35.960
Damn! My husband!

11:02.110 --> 11:04.680
The boy doesn't want
to play ball with me.

11:06.510 --> 11:07.720
Where were you, man?

11:11.450 --> 11:16.760
Holy shit, that's a hot brunette.
Great move.

11:27.170 --> 11:31.380
Hasten to battle, men of Bayamo

11:31.470 --> 11:35.940
The motherland looks proudly to you

11:36.040 --> 11:40.250
Do not fear a glorious death

11:40.350 --> 11:44.050
Because to die for the motherland
is to live...

11:48.820 --> 11:53.170
- Why do we always meet here?
- It's a tradition.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.600
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

11:55.690 --> 12:00.010
Mario isn't feeling well today,
so he asked me to talk with you.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.010
Okay, let's get started.

12:02.970 --> 12:06.920
Yudmila says we need more whiskey,
so get it from Loco.

12:07.070 --> 12:09.210
Darling, don't you know Loco died?

12:10.580 --> 12:12.580
With your habit of fishing
in that little raft of yours,

12:12.680 --> 12:14.090
you're eating more shit every day.

12:14.180 --> 12:18.560
Like Alice... "in the Wonderland."
Careful!

12:18.720 --> 12:24.930
Eight radios have been stolen
this week from parked cars. Here!

12:25.090 --> 12:28.090
We need to pay attention
to any irregularity.

12:28.190 --> 12:31.070
The public health inspectors
were also here

12:31.160 --> 12:33.570
to warn us
about a possible epidemic.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.170
Apparently, there's some new virus
or something.

12:36.270 --> 12:38.480
What? One has to make a living.

12:38.570 --> 12:40.780
Listen, you don't shit where you eat.

12:40.940 --> 12:43.180
Girlie, if I get caught
because of you...

12:43.280 --> 12:45.280
This asshole's asking for it.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.850
Look, tell your boyfriend that no one
talks to La China like that

12:48.950 --> 12:51.090
because if I lose my temper,
I'll let Primo loose.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.460
And he didn't eat yesterday.

12:53.620 --> 12:55.330
There's chocolate here
for the whole winter.

12:55.420 --> 12:59.390
I dare you!
They call me the Normandy Butcher.

13:01.260 --> 13:04.710
Why's that?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.940
Because I minced steaks
at the Normandy Restaurant.

13:07.030 --> 13:12.740
All right, Gentlemen, we didn't come
here to see who's got a bigger one.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.480
We came to organize ourselves.

13:15.510 --> 13:20.420
We need all these people
to forget about the radio thing.

13:25.780 --> 13:27.490
Mario?
What's wrong, darling?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.470
Oh, Mommy!

13:41.630 --> 13:42.840
Oh, shit!

13:56.350 --> 13:58.950
- They bit Emilio!
- He's a pussy! Such a pussy!

14:02.250 --> 14:03.390
Check this out...

14:16.630 --> 14:18.980
But what the hell is this?

14:19.070 --> 14:21.740
Oh! He can't stand
the sight of blood.

14:23.740 --> 14:27.190
- Let's move it. This is getting ugly.
- We won't help those people?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.660
No, no, no. Fuck them.

14:28.810 --> 14:31.160
They must have forgotten
all the robbery stuff.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.560
Hey!

14:32.650 --> 14:34.630
Hey, aren't you going to help me
with this giant?

14:34.720 --> 14:35.720
Hey!

14:35.820 --> 14:37.770
Hey, Papa Smurf! Fuck you!

14:38.460 --> 14:40.400
Official report.

14:40.560 --> 14:44.600
There have been some problems
with social discipline

14:44.700 --> 14:46.110
in different areas of the capital.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.040
The police investigate isolated riots

14:49.130 --> 14:56.280
apparently caused by some dissident
groups paid by the U.. government.

14:56.610 --> 14:57.780
Dissidents...

14:57.910 --> 15:01.380
Don't fuck with me.
Mario isn't a dissident.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.120
I've never seen a bigger fat pussy
squealer in my life.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.090
That's true.

15:08.950 --> 15:13.200
What I don't like
is all this quiet everywhere.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.000
It's not good for business.

15:15.090 --> 15:16.600
There aren't even tourists.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.110
This is all crumbling.

15:20.830 --> 15:24.680
I want to leave this place
and travel around the world.

15:24.770 --> 15:27.610
If anyone asks where I'm from,
I'll say I'm from Cuba.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.380
If they ask me what Cuba is,

15:29.470 --> 15:31.610
I'll say it's a small socialist
island in the Caribbean.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.590
If they ask me what socialism is,

15:33.680 --> 15:37.390
I'll say it's a system established
by Fidel Castro 50 years ago.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.290
If they ask me who Fidel Castro is,
I'll stay there forever!

15:41.390 --> 15:45.060
That's my boy.
Just so you know!

15:47.090 --> 15:53.470
Son, your words
have moved me deeply.

15:53.570 --> 15:56.810
Holy shit, California, keep it up.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.080
You'll do better than your father.

16:00.240 --> 16:00.940
Wait here for me for a moment.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.520
It seems something's up
with that crazy old bastard.

16:07.780 --> 16:09.760
What happened, Yiya?

16:09.850 --> 16:15.590
Juanito, I think my old man
died on me!

16:21.190 --> 16:22.500
He looks the same as always.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.130
I took him to the polyclinic yesterday
to get an injection.

16:25.230 --> 16:26.830
He'd been complaining all day,

16:26.930 --> 16:30.340
but since he always complains,
I ignored him!

16:30.440 --> 16:31.680
I called the family doctor,

16:31.770 --> 16:33.510
but he told me he'd come
when he had a chance.

16:33.610 --> 16:35.480
He had lots of patients

16:35.570 --> 16:39.580
because there's some kind of flu
or something going on.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.790
I won't lie to you, Yiya.
I think you're right.

16:47.890 --> 16:49.260
He's no longer with us.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.160
Don't do this that me!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my God!

16:52.260 --> 16:54.640
No, calm down. Take it easy.
I'm not a doctor.

16:54.730 --> 16:57.000
You should call an ambulance first.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.180
I wanted to see you like this
since I was a kid, you old fucker.

17:07.270 --> 17:10.010
I have the number here!

17:10.110 --> 17:12.050
No, don't worry.

17:12.140 --> 17:15.650
Looks like he was just
sleeping soundly.

17:15.750 --> 17:22.860
Old man, you scared me so bad!

17:22.950 --> 17:26.960
Yiya, call an ambulance anyway.
Just to be sure, okay?

17:27.060 --> 17:30.200
Oh, dear,
what would I do without you?

17:32.160 --> 17:36.410
- When did Rogelio stop walking?
- 15 years ago. Why?

17:40.740 --> 17:41.840
A miracle!

17:41.940 --> 17:43.680
No, no.
I don't believe it's a miracle, Yiya.

17:43.780 --> 17:44.850
A miracle, a miracle!

17:44.940 --> 17:46.950
Call my house
and tell them to come down.

17:51.420 --> 17:54.090
Rogelio, what's wrong with you?

17:54.250 --> 17:55.860
Yiya, call my house, please!

17:57.820 --> 18:02.400
It's Yiya, the neighbor from 8B.

18:02.490 --> 18:06.410
Oh, sweetheart, not too bad.
You know how it is at this age.

18:06.570 --> 18:10.140
Yeah, I saw the boy the other day.
So cute.

18:10.240 --> 18:10.910
Yiya!

18:11.070 --> 18:15.950
Juanito wants you to come down
for a moment. It's urgent!

18:16.040 --> 18:18.950
I don't know what's wrong with him!
He's never been violent!

18:19.110 --> 18:24.390
This is because of the expired drugs
they give away at the polyclinic!

18:25.220 --> 18:27.460
Rogelio! What have they done to you?
What happened to you?

18:27.620 --> 18:30.760
- Help me, damn it!
- You know me, Rogelio!

18:30.860 --> 18:33.670
Take it easy on him.
He's very old.

18:33.830 --> 18:38.100
- I've got an idea.
- Dad, the two of us can't hold him!

18:38.260 --> 18:44.150
Rogelio, look at me!
It's me, Yiya!

18:44.240 --> 18:45.840
- Step aside, Juan.
- What are you going to do with that?

18:45.940 --> 18:47.980
- It worked yesterday.
- Give it to me, man.

18:48.140 --> 18:49.120
You are not going
to harpoon the old man.

18:49.210 --> 18:50.920
- Yes, I am --
- But it's Rogelio, damn it!

18:51.010 --> 18:52.110
He's a crazy bastard!

18:58.220 --> 19:01.130
I will never let you touch
that harpoon again!

19:17.840 --> 19:20.480
This is not a dissident.

19:23.210 --> 19:25.150
Vampires?

19:25.980 --> 19:28.460
- I told you to get a stake!
- This scares them.

19:28.550 --> 19:30.550
Go find a stake, damn it!

19:30.650 --> 19:33.960
Juan, don't shout at me
because I get stuck.

19:34.050 --> 19:36.000
This building is very weird, man,
it's very weird.

19:36.090 --> 19:37.730
Hey, the garlic thing is not working.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.670
Hold him tight.

20:08.190 --> 20:09.690
Silver bullets?

20:09.790 --> 20:11.670
Do you have anything
to shoot them with?

20:11.760 --> 20:14.800
Do you even have any silver?

20:14.890 --> 20:16.700
Maybe he's possessed?

20:21.330 --> 20:26.110
Demon, leave this body in peace.
Demon, leave this body in peace!

20:26.210 --> 20:28.520
Demon, leave this body in peace!

20:28.670 --> 20:32.990
- That's not a prayer!
- Do you know any?

20:33.080 --> 20:37.550
Demon, damn the entrails' blood
of the mother who gave birth to you!

20:37.650 --> 20:40.130
Fuck you, Demon!
Leave this body in peace, Demon!

20:40.290 --> 20:41.530
Let him go, damn it!

20:41.620 --> 20:45.300
Get out of there!
Get out, damned Demon!

20:45.390 --> 20:46.960
Fuck you, Demon!

20:58.140 --> 21:02.210
Son, these dissidents are well fed!

21:06.780 --> 21:08.760
And what do we do now?

21:21.730 --> 21:24.230
- More careful with the old lady!
- What's wrong?

21:24.330 --> 21:25.640
Boy, the old lady was nice.

21:25.730 --> 21:28.710
The least we can do
is to treat her with respect.

21:31.170 --> 21:33.340
What's that?

21:33.910 --> 21:35.610
Jump! Jump!

21:36.610 --> 21:37.280
Shit!

22:11.840 --> 22:15.450
I'll start working out tomorrow
with the old guys at the park.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.980
I'm telling you, man,
this neighborhood is really weird.

23:07.070 --> 23:09.600
Stop breaking my balls!
I don't know what's going on.

23:09.700 --> 23:12.080
This is the quietest place
in the world.

23:34.060 --> 23:36.730
Don't look at me.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.270
She was so hot.

23:42.370 --> 23:44.610
Come on.
The cops are coming.

23:56.820 --> 23:57.590
Sara?

23:59.320 --> 24:01.920
This is bringing out
the good neighbor in me.

24:13.970 --> 24:15.970
Thank you, God!

24:27.780 --> 24:34.320
Mari, I don't know
what happened.

24:34.420 --> 24:40.560
She was feeling ill...
She was trying to bite me.

24:40.660 --> 24:43.400
We fought. I don't know...

24:49.000 --> 24:51.310
It was an accident.

24:53.010 --> 24:56.150
I believe you.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.190
Come with me if you want to live.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.780
Let's go!

25:06.250 --> 25:09.290
This is what I can offer you.

25:09.390 --> 25:12.060
Relax. Take a bath.

25:23.440 --> 25:27.850
The revolutionary police force
warns all citizens

25:27.940 --> 25:30.550
about some incidents produced
by antisocial people

25:30.640 --> 25:32.550
in collusion with the empire.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.620
The population
has come out on the streets...

25:33.710 --> 25:37.020
- What does "collusion" mean?
- It means we're gonna get fucked.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.150
...To hold a protest in favor
of our country.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.390
It is through this media
that we're encouraging you

25:41.090 --> 25:43.430
to participate in a demonstration
tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.900
in front of the anti-imperialist tribune

25:45.990 --> 25:50.340
to protest recent aggressions
by the United States government.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.910
What's going on? Anything new?

26:01.010 --> 26:04.750
Nothing. There are no cars.
The stores are closed.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.550
Like in the Special Period.

26:10.620 --> 26:14.090
Maybe this will bring those dissidents
down a peg or two.

26:17.790 --> 26:20.860
I very much doubt it.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.040
It looks the same to me.

26:29.230 --> 26:30.470
You think so?

26:32.500 --> 26:34.480
Take a good look.

26:51.090 --> 26:52.730
What's he doing?

26:52.820 --> 26:55.100
He was acting so mature last night.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.540
California!

26:59.560 --> 27:01.070
Shit!

27:05.200 --> 27:08.550
Shit! Can't these people shut up
when they see someone's working?

27:08.640 --> 27:10.640
You're a boy, man.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.090
I'm going to get rich with all this.

27:17.250 --> 27:20.460
I don't think it looks
like anyone can get rich.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.510
- What? We have to be ready.
- They're not American, man.

28:05.730 --> 28:10.300
I have the feeling that this
requires a plan of some kind...

28:10.400 --> 28:11.570
...which I don't have right now.

28:12.940 --> 28:15.350
Go wait for me at home.
I have to do something.

31:59.230 --> 32:02.070
Juan, Juan!

32:02.230 --> 32:04.800
You have to climb!
I can't lift you up on my own!

32:21.190 --> 32:23.000
Can't you see
that I'd die without you?

32:23.090 --> 32:25.430
Juan, don't start with that, okay?

32:27.630 --> 32:31.330
- Did you see my grandmother?
- More or less...

32:31.430 --> 32:35.740
- How is she?
- She looks just the same.

32:52.420 --> 32:58.330
They taught me that in Angola.
It's a long story.

33:10.340 --> 33:13.320
Hey, California, I need a favor.

33:13.470 --> 33:15.040
Take care of her.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.480
- And you are...?
- Camila.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.820
California. Vladi California.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.480
My daughter, Camila.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.890
You have a daughter?

33:28.050 --> 33:30.030
She doesn't look like you at all.

33:30.190 --> 33:32.860
If you lay a finger on her,

33:32.960 --> 33:37.060
I'll rip your balls off
and stick them up your ass.

33:37.230 --> 33:40.840
Be careful with this guy.
He has herpes.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.540
- And my deck chair?
- My dad took it.

33:45.640 --> 33:46.480
Where to?

33:47.570 --> 33:49.880
Fuck!

33:59.880 --> 34:01.590
Stop, asshole!

34:06.360 --> 34:11.670
Keep going. You and I are going
to start a new life... together.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.410
Stop, asshole!

34:18.000 --> 34:20.950
You shut up!
You can't just fucking leave.

34:21.110 --> 34:22.020
Don't break my balls, Juan.

34:22.110 --> 34:23.240
It's impossible to live
in this country, man.

34:23.410 --> 34:25.350
Over there, you'll have to work
for a living.

34:25.510 --> 34:27.420
- This situation will pass.
- Yeah?

34:27.510 --> 34:29.890
But what if it goes on like this
another 50 years?

34:32.150 --> 34:35.790
I have an idea.
We'll get rich with this.

34:40.060 --> 34:43.940
You're indispensable, man.
I can't do anything without you.

34:45.830 --> 34:48.110
Don't say that, man.

34:50.700 --> 34:51.810
Sara, I...

35:17.100 --> 35:19.470
And how do we get out of here?

35:19.560 --> 35:20.630
Like we always do.

35:20.730 --> 35:23.650
We just need a chance.
That's all we need.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.920
The first thing we have to do
is arm ourselves well.

35:43.020 --> 35:44.160
We need to be careful.

35:44.320 --> 35:49.000
From now on, we just go out
for the bare essentials: rum.

35:49.090 --> 35:51.540
- And food?
- Yes, well... That too.

35:51.630 --> 35:55.200
The dissidents are not very smart.
That's our advantage.

35:55.300 --> 35:58.540
I think they look drugged...
like in "Scarf ace."

35:58.700 --> 36:01.380
The one with Muni
or the one with Pacino?

36:01.540 --> 36:02.580
The one with Rocco Sifreddi.

36:04.010 --> 36:04.920
We have to take advantage
of the fact

36:05.010 --> 36:07.620
that everyone's very busy fighting
or trying to escape...

36:07.710 --> 36:10.020
...and they still don't know
what's going on.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.750
And what's going on?

36:11.850 --> 36:13.490
Not a clue.

36:14.590 --> 36:17.620
We're facing a crisis,
and there's only one thing we can do.

36:17.720 --> 36:21.000
- Help them?
- No.

36:21.090 --> 36:23.230
Charge them.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.340
30 a head.

36:26.430 --> 36:29.350
50 if we clean the place up
and get rid of the bodies.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.250
Discounts for old people
and children under 12.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.780
Foreigners and anyone
with relatives abroad pay double.

36:35.870 --> 36:39.340
I think we also need to find
a catchy name for the business.

36:41.280 --> 36:41.880
Juan?

36:44.420 --> 36:45.920
This is another long story.

36:46.020 --> 36:49.120
- You told me you'd change!
- And I have changed.

36:49.220 --> 36:51.600
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.330
How can we help you?

36:54.490 --> 36:57.200
What? I am just trying it out
to see how it sounds!

36:57.300 --> 36:58.800
You're going to charge people?

36:58.900 --> 37:00.170
Cami, we're Cuban!

37:00.330 --> 37:02.840
It's what we do
when things get tough!

37:02.940 --> 37:05.180
If that's what you want to do,
do it to help, not for money!

37:05.340 --> 37:08.250
Girl, you're the one living abroad
with your mother.

37:08.340 --> 37:10.950
Because there's nobody here
worth staying for.

37:16.220 --> 37:19.860
Juan, you know I didn't mean that.

37:20.850 --> 37:24.270
You're right.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.130
Tell me what I can do
to show you I've changed.

37:30.060 --> 37:36.210
Well, most of you have already been
in this kind of classes.

37:36.300 --> 37:39.010
It's like Preparation for Defense,

37:39.100 --> 37:42.880
only this time, the bad guys
are not the Yankees,

37:42.980 --> 37:49.090
but a real enemy,
and they're here, among us.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.720
As far as we know,
there's no stopping these people.

37:51.880 --> 37:52.760
They want to eat.

37:52.850 --> 37:58.390
Just like in the Special Period,
but they don't eat just cats.

37:59.790 --> 38:03.800
Let's see, what else
can you tell me about them?

38:05.830 --> 38:09.680
If you cause them a severe brain
trauma, you'll destroy them.

38:10.740 --> 38:11.910
Wow...

38:13.410 --> 38:16.580
- Okay, anything else?
- Some are fast and some are slow.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.350
Right. Some are slow
and others are fast.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.020
Can anyone tell me why?

38:23.950 --> 38:26.790
What a pity. I was eager
for someone to clarify that for me.

38:26.890 --> 38:27.520
Behave yourself!

38:27.690 --> 38:31.160
We're gonna teach you amateur
techniques to arm yourselves

38:31.260 --> 38:32.930
and be able to survive
without any problems.

38:33.030 --> 38:35.940
Let's take this, for example.

38:40.370 --> 38:42.280
Ernestico!

38:44.940 --> 38:47.350
I told you not to bring
any students' relatives.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.420
Shit, Juan, it's getting harder
and harder to capture them.

38:50.510 --> 38:52.920
These are from the neighborhood.

38:53.010 --> 38:54.180
Sprinkle some water on the old lady.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.880
And when she's better,
you charge her 30 pesos.

38:55.980 --> 38:58.520
No freebies here for anyone.
We're already altruistic enough.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.530
Okay, it doesn't matter.

39:00.620 --> 39:05.470
From now on, we'll call the fast ones
"hares" and the slow ones "turtles."

39:05.620 --> 39:10.660
In a combat situation,
the hares are your primary targets...

39:10.760 --> 39:13.900
You should be proud.
He's doing this for you.

39:16.270 --> 39:21.150
I'll be proud when he does it for them
or for himself.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.050
You haven't spent too much time
together, have you?

39:24.140 --> 39:26.750
You eventually get used to it.

39:26.850 --> 39:29.290
I remember that when the dollar
was penalized,

39:29.380 --> 39:30.690
my dad had me carry them for him.

39:30.780 --> 39:32.890
In case they arrested us.
They would never arrest me.

39:32.990 --> 39:34.970
Yeah? Well, that's nothing.

39:35.050 --> 39:38.560
My mom told me he dressed me up
in old clothes and dirtied my face

39:38.660 --> 39:39.760
to take me to Old Havana --

39:39.860 --> 39:42.400
- To beg stuff of tourists!
- Yes!

39:45.630 --> 39:48.810
And well,
because all that crazy stuff Juan did,

39:48.900 --> 39:52.440
my mother decided
we had to leave.

39:52.540 --> 39:55.520
I used to have fun.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.920
Your company would've been nice.

40:01.010 --> 40:06.120
- Juan told me about you.
- Yes? And what did he say?

40:09.660 --> 40:11.790
That I have what?

40:13.530 --> 40:15.600
Let's go, Juan!
We have work to do.

40:16.130 --> 40:19.130
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

40:19.230 --> 40:21.040
How can I help you?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.650
What do we do with these people?

40:33.810 --> 40:35.120
Can you handle the three in front?

40:35.210 --> 40:38.390
I can take care of them
with just a shoe.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.730
Let's go! This is self-defense.

40:41.820 --> 40:42.590
Hey, look!

40:44.060 --> 40:45.690
Come here.

40:45.790 --> 40:46.600
Come here.

40:48.830 --> 40:49.600
Come here!

40:51.400 --> 40:52.400
So you don't get this wrong,

40:52.560 --> 40:54.840
I want to tell you
that La China will not stay home

40:54.930 --> 40:56.780
nursing the eighth wonder

40:56.870 --> 40:58.280
while you line your pockets
with money.

40:58.370 --> 40:59.410
So, let's go.

40:59.570 --> 41:01.920
Don't fuck with me. This guy
can't even stand the sight of blood.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.060
70-30 the first few times.

41:08.150 --> 41:10.630
Don't be greedy, Mister. 50-50.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.160
No way, dear China.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.850
Go back to your nest in Canton.
It doesn't work that way.

41:22.190 --> 41:25.370
- 60-40.
- It worked. Come on.

41:47.390 --> 41:48.300
360!

42:15.210 --> 42:17.220
Knee to the north!

42:17.820 --> 42:18.560
Down!

42:35.700 --> 42:37.840
- China!
- Get away, bitch! Get away!

43:23.620 --> 43:25.290
I don't know what to do
with this one.

43:26.450 --> 43:27.330
He doesn't bother me.

43:32.220 --> 43:37.330
I give up! I give up! Please!
I'm a teacher! I don't know where I am!

43:37.430 --> 43:39.200
- Sorry, Brother. Come with me.
- You're just not normal.

43:39.300 --> 43:40.830
So sorry, Brother.

43:41.770 --> 43:44.180
What's going on? Where am I?
What did he do?

44:00.350 --> 44:03.660
Lazaro, don't! Damn it, Lazaro, don't!
Lazaro!

44:06.830 --> 44:09.310
Lazaro! Lazaro!

44:13.630 --> 44:15.370
Stop!

44:24.540 --> 44:25.820
What?

44:25.980 --> 44:27.960
He owed me money.

44:28.050 --> 44:28.680
Come on.

44:32.420 --> 44:39.100
Hey! Cut it outwith that bell!
Vladi cut it out, asshole!

44:39.190 --> 44:41.190
- Skinny fucker!
- What's wrong? They're slow!

44:41.290 --> 44:44.070
What do you mean, "slow"?
Can't you see they're behind us?

44:44.160 --> 44:50.640
Hurry up, China! Hurry!
Move it! Move it!

44:52.000 --> 44:55.180
A helicopter, Juan!
They're coming to save us!

45:06.180 --> 45:08.600
Keep your voices down
because they're upstairs.

45:08.690 --> 45:10.860
And if we don't make any noise,
they won't get upset.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.800
So, Ma'am, how many people
are we talking about?

45:13.890 --> 45:15.390
- Well, I rent four rooms...
- Yes...

45:15.490 --> 45:17.560
...but I only declare two.

45:17.660 --> 45:21.580
- You know how things are.
- And are the rooms full?

45:21.670 --> 45:23.670
I have four Spaniards.

45:23.770 --> 45:26.870
That's 60 CUCs.
And if you want us to take care of --

45:26.970 --> 45:28.920
- But that's not all.
- No?

45:30.240 --> 45:33.090
The Spanish must not be
on their own, you know?

45:33.250 --> 45:36.890
Don't worry, but you will have to pay
for every extra person.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.090
- How shall we do it?
- Like always.

45:40.190 --> 45:41.860
We go in
and see what we can wipe out.

45:41.950 --> 45:42.990
With ax in hand.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.270
Fucking Spaniards!

46:32.700 --> 46:36.350
- It could be worse.
- Really? How?

46:37.480 --> 46:41.720
Fuck your mother's heart.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.630
Everyone, everyone...

46:46.620 --> 46:48.430
Don't touch my ass!

47:06.710 --> 47:11.090
- We rocked.
- And where is...?

47:11.180 --> 47:15.120
The poor lady!
She seemed like a good woman.

47:15.210 --> 47:16.660
What happened?

47:16.750 --> 47:19.190
Check the house because
I'm not leaving without my money.

47:19.350 --> 47:21.630
Okay, Juan, take it easy.
Come on.

47:37.270 --> 47:38.980
Juan of the Dead
We kill your loved ones.

47:44.110 --> 47:45.920
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

47:46.010 --> 47:48.150
How can I help you?

47:48.310 --> 47:50.380
No, Ma'am.
This isn't the hairdresser.

48:02.030 --> 48:04.510
You know he faints easily.

48:24.220 --> 48:25.890
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

48:25.980 --> 48:27.190
How can I help you?

48:29.120 --> 48:31.070
You mean
the Paralympics champions?

48:32.490 --> 48:33.800
No, that'll be expensive.

48:38.230 --> 48:40.400
Iconoclasts!

48:45.670 --> 48:48.050
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
BUILDERS OF THE FUTURE

48:48.210 --> 48:52.280
It wasn't me, damn it!
That wasn't my fault.

48:52.440 --> 48:55.220
Come on, man.
Keep moving and don't stop!

48:55.310 --> 48:58.320
Hey, wait for me!
Don't get mad at me, shit!

48:59.950 --> 49:01.730
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

49:01.820 --> 49:03.360
How can I help you?

49:04.320 --> 49:07.700
A cow? No, no, no, man,
that's a big mess.

49:07.790 --> 49:08.790
No, no, no.

49:10.600 --> 49:18.140
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!

49:18.970 --> 49:20.510
The old man! Help him!

49:30.480 --> 49:34.360
- And the old man?
- He died. We had to leave him behind.

49:34.450 --> 49:37.060
Not necessarily in that order.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.300
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

49:47.400 --> 49:48.940
How can I help you?

49:52.540 --> 49:54.180
Who?

49:55.140 --> 49:58.490
No, no, friend,
that's your own business.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.760
It's a nice view, isn't it?

50:05.850 --> 50:07.490
Yeah.

50:07.590 --> 50:10.500
It's a shame that building
blocks out the sunset.

50:10.590 --> 50:13.760
The situation is under control again.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.410
Shut up!

51:17.260 --> 51:22.230
Vladi, what's wrong with you?

51:22.330 --> 51:24.140
He told Camila that I have herpes.

51:30.900 --> 51:33.650
That's not a big deal, boy.

51:33.740 --> 51:37.240
Let's see, raise your hand
if you don't have herpes.

51:44.650 --> 51:46.220
All this bitching
and at the end of the day,

51:46.320 --> 51:48.920
the only thing that works
is public transportation.

51:49.020 --> 51:52.830
- Do you think it's safe to get on?
- Was it ever safe?

52:04.770 --> 52:10.410
REVOLUTION OR DEATH

52:14.810 --> 52:17.020
We'd better walk.

52:21.690 --> 52:23.360
Come on.

52:27.890 --> 52:30.930
I don't know why it is that every time
one finds a way to survive --

52:31.100 --> 52:33.630
ta-daaah -- things get ugly...

52:33.730 --> 52:35.440
...and as tough
as the Russian steppes.

52:35.530 --> 52:36.710
And why don't you just leave, boy?

52:38.840 --> 52:41.040
Step aside!

52:43.280 --> 52:45.480
Mother of God!

52:45.580 --> 52:48.520
Nothing but dick
when God created that guy!

52:48.680 --> 52:49.320
Put your weapons down!

52:57.790 --> 53:01.530
- Identify yourselves!
- We're altruists.

53:01.690 --> 53:03.200
Take your clothes off.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.180
You could've waited a minute.

53:12.340 --> 53:13.870
What do you mean
take our clothes off?

53:13.970 --> 53:18.750
Take your clothes off
or we'll open fire.

53:22.110 --> 53:23.920
There's no need to intimidate.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.380
Come on, turn around.
Let's go.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.490
Move! To the truck!

53:53.550 --> 53:54.850
Move!

53:54.950 --> 53:59.620
Juan, if you cover that with a scarf,
it becomes a boy scout.

53:59.720 --> 54:01.720
China!

54:26.950 --> 54:29.020
Come on, we're going!

54:36.620 --> 54:38.260
What's the reason for this, friend?

54:38.420 --> 54:40.900
We have to pick up everyone
in the streets.

54:41.860 --> 54:44.340
There are just a few of us left --
half a dozen --

54:44.430 --> 54:46.670
and we've decided
to start from scratch.

54:46.770 --> 54:50.510
We're rescuing all survivors
and supplying them with arms.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.780
You will build the walls
of our community.

54:52.870 --> 54:55.110
Darling, you have
such a beautiful voice.

54:55.210 --> 54:56.410
What's your name?

54:56.580 --> 54:59.150
- Gabriel.
- I can't believe it.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.620
Gabriel, like the archangel!

55:01.480 --> 55:03.360
I don't know if you've noticed,

55:03.520 --> 55:05.290
but even though
they call me "La China,"

55:05.380 --> 55:07.660
my hands were not made
to build walls.

55:07.820 --> 55:11.270
If you're not with the community,
you're against the community.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.930
Boy, it's always the same thing
in this country!

55:13.090 --> 55:14.930
Look, this is part
of the world heritage

55:15.030 --> 55:16.800
and showing it for free is a waste.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.930
You could at least let us
put our clothes back on.

55:19.030 --> 55:21.310
Don't worry. You don't need clothes
where you're going.

55:21.470 --> 55:27.610
Sergeant, I think you're doing
your job very badly.

55:27.770 --> 55:29.220
Really?

56:05.040 --> 56:07.650
The keys! The keys! Quickly!

56:12.450 --> 56:14.490
The gun! The gun! The gun!

56:48.050 --> 56:50.590
All right, let's organize things.

56:50.690 --> 56:53.670
Vladi, food. Lazaro, rum.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.240
And you, Primo, find something
to cut the handcuffs.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.370
I'm sick of being tied up
to the little girl here.

56:58.460 --> 57:00.770
Excuse me? "Little girl"?

57:00.870 --> 57:03.370
You didn't see the camping tent
between my legs, did you?

57:13.980 --> 57:16.290
- Camila!
- Ow...

57:17.820 --> 57:19.020
Camila!

57:19.120 --> 57:21.530
- Juan, don't shout.
- Camila!

57:21.620 --> 57:25.360
- Juan, lower your voice!
- Camila!

57:25.460 --> 57:27.770
- Juan, stop yelling, man.
- Take it easy.

57:27.860 --> 57:29.360
I'm looking for my daughter.
Camila!

57:29.460 --> 57:33.100
- Look, listen to me.
- Camila!

57:33.200 --> 57:34.680
Camila!

57:34.770 --> 57:36.750
It hurts here...
Take a look and see what I --

58:10.700 --> 58:15.120
Juan, look what I have to do
to surprise you!

58:28.450 --> 58:32.800
- Juan, I'm not feeling well.
- Me neither. What the hell?

58:39.460 --> 58:41.210
What's that?

58:41.300 --> 58:44.410
What, Juan?

58:44.500 --> 58:47.140
Oh, man, a scratch.
I must have hurt myself in the truck.

58:47.340 --> 58:48.370
Are you sure?

58:48.470 --> 58:50.320
Juan, don't make a fuss.
Of course I am.

58:50.410 --> 58:52.390
- Camila!
- Juan, don't shout.

58:52.540 --> 58:53.550
Camila!

58:53.650 --> 58:55.220
Juan, don't shout!
I'm not feeling well.

58:55.410 --> 58:57.950
Quickly, find something
to cut his handcuffs! He's dying!

58:58.050 --> 58:59.390
No offense, China.

58:59.550 --> 59:02.230
Hurry up! I don't want to be next
to him when he gets annoying!

59:06.860 --> 59:08.740
China, I'll give you a bigger
share in the business,

59:08.830 --> 59:09.900
but please, don't do this to me.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.370
China!
China!

59:40.330 --> 59:41.530
Do you know what's going on?

59:41.690 --> 59:44.070
- She wants to kill me
- She wants to kill me

59:44.230 --> 59:46.400
- She wants to hit me
- She wants to hit me

59:46.500 --> 59:48.640
- She wants to make me sleep
- She wants to make me sleep

59:48.800 --> 59:50.710
- And I won't let her
- No, no, no

59:50.800 --> 59:52.480
- She wants to kill me
- She wants to kill me

59:52.800 --> 59:55.810
- And I won't let her
- No, no no

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:07.930
- What's going on?
- Come on up, come on up

1:00:10.490 --> 1:00:12.470
- She wants to kill me
- She wants to kill me

1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:14.590
She wants to hit me

1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:20.740
And what happened here?

1:00:22.170 --> 1:00:23.170
What the hell!

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.270
Hurry!
Find something to cut this!

1:00:26.770 --> 1:00:27.580
Here!

1:00:30.410 --> 1:00:32.650
No, no, no!
Don't even think about it!

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:38.960
No, no, no!
Are you high or something?

1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:40.030
Vladi!

1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:43.830
- What's this for?
- For his hand.

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:44.490
Oh! Okay.

1:00:44.590 --> 1:00:46.260
Leave me alone, fucking China!

1:01:07.680 --> 1:01:10.750
- Good idea.
- Thanks!

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:14.490
Did you get what I asked you for?

1:01:15.090 --> 1:01:18.970
Listen, man, I got to the place
and my mind went blank.

1:01:19.060 --> 1:01:20.760
What is it that I had to do?

1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.240
Official release.

1:01:26.330 --> 1:01:30.180
Once again, our people
have proven that they're invincible.

1:01:30.270 --> 1:01:33.650
We have rejected another
aggression from the United States.

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:37.790
To all citizens: You may continue
with your daily routine.

1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:39.860
Everything is back to normal.

1:01:39.950 --> 1:01:43.420
ONE MONTH LATER

1:01:47.390 --> 1:01:49.660
Are there many of them?

1:01:51.820 --> 1:01:54.800
Like the last few weeks.
They're all infected.

1:01:54.890 --> 1:01:56.770
There's no one normal left.

1:01:58.330 --> 1:02:00.640
I bet I can smash
the skinny one's head.

1:02:00.730 --> 1:02:01.730
Take this!

1:02:03.470 --> 1:02:06.540
Fuck, Lazaro! Can't you distinguish
the good ones from the bad ones?

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:10.050
Girl, it's always been difficult
to do that in this country.

1:02:10.210 --> 1:02:12.280
Here comes Vladi.

1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:21.290
- Did he make it?
- Yes.

1:02:21.450 --> 1:02:23.360
It looks like he found food.

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:33.810
Juan, your hot neighbor
is a dissident, too.

1:02:35.030 --> 1:02:39.110
Fuck!
I 'd forgotten about Lucia.

1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:01.190
Juan, you have to see this!

1:03:11.270 --> 1:03:14.650
Change of plans.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:16.480
Should we go to the mountains
and start an uprising?

1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:18.120
You're joking now,

1:03:18.210 --> 1:03:21.620
but that's what we should've
done from the beginning.

1:03:23.650 --> 1:03:26.130
Fuck, don't look at me like that!
It's the truth.

1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:30.090
I won't stay here waiting
for things to get better

1:03:30.190 --> 1:03:31.830
while Havana burns down.

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:34.630
Juan, we can't fight them all.

1:03:34.730 --> 1:03:37.040
Plan B,
let's look for a boat to leave.

1:03:37.130 --> 1:03:38.470
To Miami?

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:40.510
Anywhere.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.550
To Miami if there's no other choice.

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:49.450
Fuck, in the end,
capitalism will take its toll on us.

1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:52.520
Get ready! Arm yourselves well!
We have to get out of here!

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:02.720
- Where is everybody?
- In their homes. Can't you hear them?

1:04:02.890 --> 1:04:05.230
Will they stay there forever?

1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:08.330
It won't be much different
from what they did before.

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:16.640
If we're going to do this,
let's do it with style.

1:04:32.450 --> 1:04:33.160
Juan, step aside!

1:04:36.350 --> 1:04:37.920
Should we just leave her?

1:04:38.020 --> 1:04:41.060
What better place for her
to spend the rest of her life?

1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:43.110
Let's go to that car!

1:04:50.970 --> 1:04:51.970
Come on.

1:05:00.410 --> 1:05:02.520
Don't tell me you guys can't drive!

1:05:06.580 --> 1:05:09.660
Later, we'll all have
a very serious chat!

1:05:20.060 --> 1:05:21.940
Juan, hurry up!
They're already coming.

1:05:22.030 --> 1:05:24.780
Hurry, Juan! Hurry, Juan!
They're getting closer!

1:05:24.870 --> 1:05:25.970
What's going on?

1:05:26.070 --> 1:05:27.740
- Juan!
- Hurry! They're getting closer!

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:29.750
Juan!
Juan they're getting closer!

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:30.950
Please, hurry!

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:32.920
Fuck! Leave me alone!

1:05:33.010 --> 1:05:34.750
Fuck you!

1:05:34.850 --> 1:05:37.450
Juan, hurry.
Hurry, hurry! Please!

1:05:37.550 --> 1:05:38.820
God damn it, Juan!

1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:40.760
NOW!

1:05:40.850 --> 1:05:42.300
We fucked them!
Hell, yeah!

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:50.870
Dissidents, imperialists,
slaves, faggots, pieces of shit!

1:05:58.670 --> 1:06:03.550
Motherfucking Russians that brought
these fucked-up Lada cars to Cuba!

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:05.590
Juan, please, forget about the car!

1:06:10.350 --> 1:06:14.730
Primo, don't even think about taking
the blindfold off or you'll faint.

1:06:14.820 --> 1:06:15.820
What should we do now?

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:17.420
What can we do?
Follow her!

1:06:18.990 --> 1:06:20.530
Camila!

1:06:22.590 --> 1:06:24.700
Plan C, there's a shelter
at the corner.

1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:27.000
- A shelter?
- Yeah, man, a shelter!

1:06:27.130 --> 1:06:30.170
Go underground and come out armed
when the enemy attacks.

1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:33.610
Up, Primo.
This got good.

1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:35.780
Vladi, you protect Snow White.

1:06:35.870 --> 1:06:38.620
Hey, people,
can you tell me what's wrong?

1:06:38.710 --> 1:06:41.210
Calm down, Primo.
Juan is taking us to a safe place.

1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:52.430
Step aside, Juan.
This is a man's job.

1:06:58.930 --> 1:07:01.970
See? I opened it!

1:07:04.640 --> 1:07:05.640
Juan!

1:07:07.470 --> 1:07:09.420
Primo!

1:07:20.180 --> 1:07:22.030
Juan, enough of your great plans!

1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:24.190
We went from being an orchestra
to a garage band!

1:07:24.290 --> 1:07:25.500
We just need a chance.
That's all we --

1:07:25.590 --> 1:07:27.190
Please!
Don't start with that now, okay?

1:07:34.100 --> 1:07:37.140
Camila, everything I did
was intended to help you.

1:07:39.740 --> 1:07:44.380
Look, when I first saw you
in your mother's arms,

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:48.320
from that moment,
you've been the love of my life.

1:07:50.210 --> 1:07:53.990
Sorry to interrupt
this cute love scene.

1:07:54.090 --> 1:07:55.430
Look that way.

1:08:07.030 --> 1:08:08.440
No fucking way!

1:09:00.250 --> 1:09:01.460
Get down!

1:09:35.890 --> 1:09:38.560
Wow...

1:09:41.290 --> 1:09:43.570
What is he saying?

1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:45.970
I don't know,
but let's get in the car.

1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:18.100
He was a fucking pain in the ass!

1:10:55.370 --> 1:10:59.340
- Vladi, did you get that?
- No, I only speak Italian.

1:11:01.610 --> 1:11:03.780
Don't look at me.
You were the English teacher.

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:05.380
But that was in high school!

1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:07.050
Well, that's more
than the rest of us know.

1:11:07.210 --> 1:11:09.220
Didn't they teach you English
in Spain?

1:11:09.380 --> 1:11:11.760
Juan, I'm really bad at languages.

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:34.680
- Juan, ask him what's going on.
- That's all I can say in English.

1:11:34.770 --> 1:11:38.810
Juan, our lives are at risk,
so cooperate.

1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:45.020
What are they?

1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:48.060
Possessed people?
Werewolves? Vampires?

1:11:48.150 --> 1:11:49.790
Dissidents? Lobsters?

1:12:36.300 --> 1:12:38.580
And? What did he say?

1:12:38.670 --> 1:12:40.410
Something about Old Havana.

1:12:40.510 --> 1:12:42.210
Yes, I understood that, too.

1:12:42.310 --> 1:12:42.910
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:12:43.010 --> 1:12:45.490
Okay.
Then ask him how to stop them.

1:13:16.580 --> 1:13:19.610
You asshole!

1:13:19.710 --> 1:13:20.780
I didn't mean to.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:23.380
Juan, these friends of yours
give me the creeps!

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:26.520
- So, what did he say?
- He had a plan.

1:13:26.620 --> 1:13:27.720
Fuck!
Don't look at me like that!

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.320
This cocksucker killed him
before he told me what it was!

1:13:30.420 --> 1:13:32.490
Juan, apologizing
won't bring him back.

1:13:32.590 --> 1:13:34.700
Take it easy!

1:13:34.790 --> 1:13:37.500
Let me sit
and think about our next move.

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.670
- Kids, I --
- Lazaro...

1:13:40.770 --> 1:13:42.710
...you're disgusting!

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:46.610
Man, you sure know
how to screw things up!

1:14:01.650 --> 1:14:05.800
Boy, why don't we take one of those
cars and we arm it -- I don't know --

1:14:05.890 --> 1:14:06.530
like a tank.

1:14:06.690 --> 1:14:09.730
We add on some metal sheets...

1:14:09.830 --> 1:14:12.600
I mean, an amphibian.

1:14:12.700 --> 1:14:16.700
And there must be enough food
in this building to take with us.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.980
Fuck, Brother, that sounds
like something we can do.

1:14:21.070 --> 1:14:22.180
Right?

1:14:24.910 --> 1:14:27.690
Juan, there's something else.

1:14:27.850 --> 1:14:29.920
Tell me, tell me. If you're going
to go on like this, shoot.

1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:35.890
No, Brother, no.

1:14:37.090 --> 1:14:38.590
Yes.

1:14:41.190 --> 1:14:42.800
I don't care if I die.

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:45.700
What I would hate is waking up
next to you guys like this.

1:14:45.860 --> 1:14:49.110
Lazaro, you can't ask me to do that.

1:14:51.070 --> 1:14:55.710
And why not? I'd hit you
with the machete without mercy.

1:14:55.870 --> 1:14:57.290
Really?

1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:00.050
Sure.

1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:06.390
Well, okay, I'll do it.

1:15:06.490 --> 1:15:08.160
Is there anything
you want to do before?

1:15:10.820 --> 1:15:17.170
I'd like to see one last sunrise.

1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:48.400
- How do you want me to do it?
- I don't understand.

1:15:48.490 --> 1:15:53.200
Should I smash your head
with my paddle,

1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:55.870
drop you from the building,
chop you with a machete?

1:15:55.970 --> 1:15:58.950
How do you want me to do it?

1:16:01.670 --> 1:16:04.520
On the head, with the paddle.

1:16:04.610 --> 1:16:07.490
But, please, don't hit my face.

1:16:07.580 --> 1:16:11.150
I was in more than 25 brawls,
but no one ever hit my face.

1:16:14.690 --> 1:16:19.160
If when the sun comes up,
you're still not dead...

1:16:19.260 --> 1:16:21.330
...should I kill you?

1:16:21.490 --> 1:16:27.140
Juan, you're a real pain in the ass.
Wait until I die, would you?

1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:29.110
Will you take care of my kid?

1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.180
As if he were mine.

1:16:35.910 --> 1:16:42.420
Juan, there's one thing I always
wanted to tell you.

1:16:42.510 --> 1:16:44.590
Tell me.

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.260
I love you.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:52.760
I love you, too, Brother.

1:16:52.860 --> 1:16:56.100
No, you don't understand.
I love you.

1:16:59.730 --> 1:17:02.680
Come on, Lazaro...

1:17:02.770 --> 1:17:06.080
I hid this from you this whole time,
but now, who cares?

1:17:06.170 --> 1:17:08.170
I love you. I really love you.

1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:15.680
- Are you angry at me?
- No, not angry. Not at all.

1:17:21.550 --> 1:17:22.760
Would you let me give you
a blow job?

1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:25.100
Be careful, man!

1:17:25.190 --> 1:17:27.470
Be careful or you won't see
the sunrise!

1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:30.510
I'm sure I won't see it.
So, who cares?

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:35.880
Come on, just a taste.

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:40.810
Juan, you can't refuse
a dying man a favor.

1:17:40.910 --> 1:17:44.380
Come on, don't be mean.

1:17:52.790 --> 1:17:57.360
Okay, go ahead!
Nobody will know anyway.

1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:08.010
I fucking gotcha, Brother!

1:18:09.570 --> 1:18:12.640
Man, you're a huge faggot!

1:18:13.170 --> 1:18:14.810
You shit-head!

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:19.850
You're a real dirty bastard.

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:34.740
You're just like those
metro sexual men.

1:18:41.700 --> 1:18:45.980
You're a good friend, Juan.
No doubt about that.

1:18:57.380 --> 1:19:01.830
Don't touch me.
I'm not totally convinced yet.

1:19:01.990 --> 1:19:05.990
Free Havana

1:20:00.210 --> 1:20:03.790
Fuck, dickhead, faggot!
You hit me hard!

1:20:03.950 --> 1:20:05.430
But what happened?
Why aren't you dead?

1:20:05.580 --> 1:20:07.460
What the fuck do I know, man?

1:20:07.550 --> 1:20:11.470
Are you a 100 percent sure
they bit you?

1:20:14.590 --> 1:20:15.800
30.

1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:21.900
Come on, let's go. We have
to make sure the kids are okay.

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:32.120
Get up. Move.

1:20:32.210 --> 1:20:34.120
We have a lot of things to search for.

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.780
I have a plan.

1:21:14.150 --> 1:21:17.830
Of all the crazy ideas you ever had,
I think this is the worst one.

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.600
I know.

1:21:27.030 --> 1:21:30.280
Do you think the same thing
is going on outside?

1:21:30.370 --> 1:21:32.080
I don't know.

1:21:36.070 --> 1:21:38.110
Do you think mom is fine?

1:21:41.010 --> 1:21:42.750
I don't know.

1:21:49.490 --> 1:21:52.090
We'll get out of this, right?

1:22:17.050 --> 1:22:20.120
Are you sure about this, Juan?

1:22:20.220 --> 1:22:24.260
In the end, this is a fucking island
and the only way out is by sea.

1:22:31.460 --> 1:22:32.940
How are you feeling?

1:22:33.030 --> 1:22:36.840
Just like when I came into the world.
Full of shit and piss.

1:22:36.940 --> 1:22:40.850
Let's see what we're made of.

1:22:48.010 --> 1:22:54.190
Iconoclasts! Faggots!

1:22:55.690 --> 1:22:59.600
Anarchic dissidents!

1:24:11.630 --> 1:24:16.240
- Will it be enough with these guys?
- I hope so.

1:24:16.330 --> 1:24:21.220
Help! Help!

1:24:21.310 --> 1:24:24.750
Help!

1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:28.850
- Motherfucker!
- Help!

1:24:28.950 --> 1:24:32.450
- You go on, and I'll reach you later.
- You sure?

1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:40.690
Are you okay?
Did they bite you?

1:25:40.790 --> 1:25:43.200
My dad tried to bite me,
but I escaped.

1:25:43.290 --> 1:25:44.730
Okay, close your eyes.

1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.010
Sodomite!

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.530
Cross your fingers.

1:27:35.730 --> 1:27:36.970
Damn it, Juan!

1:27:55.450 --> 1:27:56.400
Get in, Juan.

1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:14.710
Juan! Juan, you can't do this!

1:28:14.870 --> 1:28:17.320
Actually, I should've done it
from the beginning.

1:28:17.410 --> 1:28:19.220
Maybe things wouldn't
have turned out so bad.

1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:21.690
Juan, don't be such a jerk.
Get in the car. Come on!

1:28:21.850 --> 1:28:24.330
I'm a survivor.

1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:29.490
I survived Mariel, I survived Angola,
I survived the Special Period,

1:28:29.590 --> 1:28:31.570
and this thing that came afterward.

1:28:31.660 --> 1:28:34.140
And I will survive this.

1:28:34.230 --> 1:28:38.200
Maybe people will see me
and join me to help.

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:41.900
I'm fine here. I like it here.

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.210
Over there, you have your mother.

1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:46.710
She'll take care of you.

1:28:46.810 --> 1:28:48.910
Will you give your mom a kiss
for me?

1:28:49.010 --> 1:28:50.210
Dad, please...

1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:55.590
It's the first time you call me that.

1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:58.460
Take care of her, okay?

1:28:58.550 --> 1:29:03.800
Shit, you make a good couple.

1:29:03.890 --> 1:29:04.890
If you touch her,
I'll cut your dick off!

1:29:07.890 --> 1:29:12.810
And now, get the hell out of here
or I'll start crying.

1:30:29.440 --> 1:30:31.320
I'll be all right.

1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:41.300
I just need a chance.

1:30:44.990 --> 1:30:47.370
I am Juan.

1:32:14.810 --> 1:32:17.760
UNTIL VICTORY
ALWAYS
