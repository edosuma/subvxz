WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.421
Ah!

00:05.005 --> 00:06.673
Listen to those birds.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.300
Mmm.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.260
Love it out here. It's so peaceful.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.014
We should have done this months ago.
I'm going to go for a run.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.350
- Okay, let's just make sure it's safe.
- Okay.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.101
Okay, now! Go now.

00:19.311 --> 00:23.190
<i>Four days ago, Claire and I
moved out here to the driveway.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:26.610
The house exceeded maximum capacity
when Alex moved back home.

00:26.610 --> 00:30.405
She quit her fancy job
for something low-paying and ethical.

00:30.489 --> 00:34.701
Yay! Between her, Luke, Dylan,
Haley and the twins,

00:34.785 --> 00:37.037
things have devolved into total chaos.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.875
Alex! Open up! My hair is drying
and I haven't put any product in yet.

00:41.959 --> 00:45.379
Go use Dad's! Ugh! Can I get, like,
two minutes to myself?

00:45.796 --> 00:47.881
Oh, my God!

00:47.965 --> 00:50.759
Hey! You woke up the babies, you idiot!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.178
Haley.
- Oh, great. Now, he's up.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.389
Darn it, Luke, that was my foot.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.183
Who made macaroni and cheese
and left it out?

00:58.267 --> 01:00.102
Sorry, Mrs. D, that was me and Luke.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.814
But in our defense, we were high
and got spooked by your German dishwasher.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.692
Well, now the entire kitchen is covered
with ants, and so am I.

01:06.692 --> 01:07.860
God, I gotta take a shower.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.862
Well, good luck with that,
no more hot water.

01:09.862 --> 01:13.699
Yep. Gonna lose a toenail.
There goes sandal season!

01:27.296 --> 01:28.463
Oh.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.300
- Do you love it?
- Oh, my God, you've gotten so much done.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.510
Well, I wanted to finish it
before the housewarming.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.721
- It looks so good.
- Thank you.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.348
I swear, it's this place.
It makes me better at things.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.226
Yesterday, I threw my T-shirt
at the laundry basket,

01:41.310 --> 01:44.021
yelled "money" and it almost went in.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.565
It's been a weird and wonderful month.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.526
- We adopted a baby boy.
- And we moved into a new home.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.153
Which we love so much,

01:51.153 --> 01:54.281
we named our son
after our street, Rexford.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.201
Rex Tucker-Pritchett. With a name
like that, he can be anything he wants,

01:57.201 --> 02:00.078
a quarterback, a running back,
a middle linebacker.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.789
He's got big feet,
maybe he could be a kicker.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.458
Why don't you believe in him, Mitchell?

02:07.711 --> 02:10.005
This is crazy, we're out of everything.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.298
Is that the last of the cereal?

02:11.298 --> 02:14.635
Oh, we haven't had cereal in days.
This is formula over croutons.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.386
They're gross.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.305
Coffee dust.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.140
Ew.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.434
Oh, don't judge me!

02:22.518 --> 02:24.311
You've been wearing
bathing suits for underwear

02:24.311 --> 02:25.604
since the washing machine broke.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.272
I wish I had a clean bathing suit.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.775
I had to cut leg holes into a shower cap.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.443
Do I have coffee in my teeth?

02:32.194 --> 02:34.696
Arvin wants to meet before I sign
the contract, for some reason.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.198
Ooh.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.825
I bet I know the reason why.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.744
'Cause he wants to get with you.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.497
No, he does not. He's about to be my boss.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.791
Which is why he wants to talk
before you sign.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.001
Nowadays, you get in trouble
for dating at work,

02:48.085 --> 02:50.587
unless it's a pre-existing relationship.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.006
I know this because
I had to go to an HR thing

02:53.090 --> 02:56.176
thanks to some smoking hot janitor
who can't take a compliment.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.804
Married mother of two, and you are insane.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.807
Arvin doesn't see me that way.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.810
I mean, does he, do you think?

03:04.810 --> 03:09.606
Yes. He gets all nervous and
yammery when he's around you.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.067
How do you still not know you're a babe?

03:12.067 --> 03:15.195
Well, I mean, you did call me
a frumpy nerd for 20 years.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.364
Well, I didn't stop because I got nicer.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.324
Who ate all the formula and croutons?

03:19.408 --> 03:21.243
Where are Mom and Dad? We need food.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.705
Wait. What's that smell?

03:26.331 --> 03:29.251
Phil, bacon? They're going to smell that.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.171
Oh, my God, I didn't think
about that. Quick, eat it!

03:32.171 --> 03:35.132
Worth it! Worth it!

03:35.674 --> 03:37.676
Hey, they have food.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.137
And coffee. Are you guys living in here?

03:40.137 --> 03:42.431
Mom, I need to borrow some underwear.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.895
It's not my fault. I tried to stop him.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.271
Stop who? What happened?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.566
<i>Ay,</i> your hair! Where is it?

03:52.566 --> 03:55.777
Dad took me to his barber. It was so cool.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.446
Have you heard of <i>Playboy?</i>

03:57.446 --> 03:59.865
- I'm going to kill him.
- It gets worse.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.159
He went rogue on Mitch
and Cam's housewarming gift.

04:02.159 --> 04:06.330
So he didn't buy the coffee table book
about Los Angeles through the decades?

04:06.330 --> 04:08.207
Check this out.
- Oh, my God!

04:08.207 --> 04:11.418
See? You don't get that reaction
from a picture of a dusty guy

04:11.502 --> 04:13.212
picking oranges on Sunset Boulevard.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.173
That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.758
But I like my hair.

04:17.758 --> 04:22.387
No, not you, sweetie. You're perfect,
and no woman will ever deserve you.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.931
Hey, I don't know if you journal,

04:23.931 --> 04:26.642
but you might want to dog-ear
today's page for your future therapist.

04:26.642 --> 04:30.270
Jay, you can't be buying
home decor things for gays.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.314
Mitch and Cam
are going to hate this thing.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.483
No, they won't.
The guys are going to love it.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.068
Just like Joe loves his haircut.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.362
<i>Ay.</i> Everybody is going to think
that he has lice.

04:38.362 --> 04:43.200
I hope not, bad hygiene is one of
Miss September's three biggest turnoffs.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.330
Mitchell, I love this house!

04:48.330 --> 04:50.958
- Do you love it? Say you love it.
- I do, I love it.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.795
I love the flow, I love the lights,
I love the location.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.172
There... There's even
a karaoke room in the basement.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.632
So fun!

04:58.632 --> 05:02.219
The last time I had a hot mike
in my basement...

05:02.219 --> 05:04.388
You know what? I'm going to wait
till there are more people here.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.599
Oh, the baby is awake.
Do you wanna meet him?

05:07.683 --> 05:11.311
I do. I can ask him
if he liked our gift. We never heard.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.233
Hello. <i>- Mr. Tucker. It's Jim Alvarez.</i>

05:16.233 --> 05:19.403
<i>Athletic Director from the University
of North Central Missouri.</i>

05:19.403 --> 05:22.614
Uh, yes, of course. How can I help you?

05:22.698 --> 05:24.783
<i>This is a bit of an awkward call.</i>

05:24.867 --> 05:27.870
<i>As you know, you were
the runner-up for our head coaching job.</i>

05:27.870 --> 05:29.079
Uh, yes, yes.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.791
You know, Coach Ashley is a great guy,
great choice. No hard feelings.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.545
I actually... I sent him a bottle
of congratulatory scotch.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.756
<i>Well, he drank it.
Then he did a press conference</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:42.467
<i>where he used some colorful language
to address a female reporter</i>

05:42.551 --> 05:46.263
<i>- and blamed some things on the Jews.</i>
- Oh, my.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.183
<i>The point is, the job is yours,
if you still want it.</i>

05:50.142 --> 05:51.935
I'm... I'm sorry. What?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.437
<i>I know this is coming at you fast,</i>

05:53.437 --> 05:55.439
<i>but I'll need an answer
by the end of the day.</i>

05:55.439 --> 05:58.567
<i>So talk it over with the mister,
and let me know.</i>

05:58.567 --> 06:02.779
Uh, yes. Yes, okay. Thank you...
Thank you very much.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.368
<i>Look at him. He's perfect.</i>

06:08.452 --> 06:10.412
<i>I know.
I know, it's all perfect.</i>

06:11.121 --> 06:13.248
<i>It's like the universe
gave me everything I wanted.</i>

06:26.303 --> 06:29.223
Okay.
Family meeting. Please, sit down.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.682
Dylan, please. Thank you.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.269
Now, um, this is going to sound harsh.

06:34.353 --> 06:38.482
No parent with half a heart
wants to say this. So, Claire?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.693
Fine, I have no problem saying it.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.654
There are too many people
living in this house.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.156
It's disgusting.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.992
I think there's something alive
in the kitchen sink water.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.369
It's just Sinky.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.788
You didn't turn on
the garbage disposal, did you?

06:53.705 --> 06:57.125
Okay... We cannot live this way.
One of you has to move out.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.836
- Are you serious?
- That's not fair.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.295
- That's not okay.
- You can't just spring this on us.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.048
I just took a huge salary cut

07:03.048 --> 07:05.050
so it is really not a good time
for me to move.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.719
Me neither. I just took
a leave of absence from work

07:07.803 --> 07:09.096
to spend more time with my family.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.224
Well, I have two babies
and a special needs husband.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.101
It's true. I have a medical condition

07:14.101 --> 07:16.770
that requires a room big enough
for a giant mattress.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.021
He sleep-wiggles.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.482
Look, if one of you doesn't volunteer,

07:20.566 --> 07:22.651
your mother is going
to have to pick someone.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.237
Well, Haley's the oldest,
there's four of them,

07:25.237 --> 07:27.865
and honestly, it's only a matter of time
before she gets pregnant again.

07:27.865 --> 07:31.451
- Especially since he's a wiggler.
- Whoa, we can say it.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.204
Well, Alex is the one
that has the most education.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.832
I shouldn't be
penalized for being smart.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.333
I'm not running for President.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.335
What about you?
Didn't you apply to college?

07:40.419 --> 07:43.589
Yeah, and I never heard back
from them. College is rude.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.258
Okay. You can figure this out
amongst the three of you

07:46.258 --> 07:47.551
as you clean up the house.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.553
We need a name by the end of the day.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.138
Well, it's not going to be me.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.765
I just can't imagine
being apart from my best friend.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.018
Nice try, Luke.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.645
- Help me, it's working.
- Oh, come on.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.483
Hey, Cam, look.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.236
Cam? Cam?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.864
Oh, um, sorry. My mind was elsewhere.

08:08.864 --> 08:11.200
Our neighbor just
dropped this off. So sweet.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.535
And guess what? She's a pediatrician.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.245
I mean, how lucky is that?

08:15.329 --> 08:16.830
That's amazing!

08:16.914 --> 08:19.208
Now you don't have to ugly up
the house with baby-proofing.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.667
Don't ever have kids.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.462
There's champagne,
there's truffles, there's caviar...

08:23.462 --> 08:26.548
City folk, huh? I mean, whatever
happened to a basket of apples

08:26.632 --> 08:28.800
and a thoughtfully-misspelled note?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.344
I mean, huh?

08:30.344 --> 08:33.472
All right, give us a tour,
and make sure it includes the bar.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.891
- Yes!
- So, let's start down in the karaoke room

08:35.891 --> 08:37.768
and then we'll work our way
up to the master.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.770
Sounds like my dream date.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.232
Sorry, I'm a single father,
I never get out.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.775
Is this still how we talk?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.693
Okay, no. All right, right this way.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.737
Okay, I hope the big earthquake
that we're long overdue for

08:48.737 --> 08:50.322
doesn't hit while you're down there.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.701
You're being so negative.
What is wrong with you?

08:54.785 --> 08:56.036
Okay, look, I have to tell someone,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.288
but you cannot repeat it
to anyone, especially Mitchell.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.584
I just got offered the football job
that I wanted in Missouri.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.127
- But you just moved in.
- I know.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.754
- With a newborn.
- I know!

09:05.838 --> 09:06.922
And you were the one pushing for both.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.632
I don't need a recap, it's my crisis!

09:08.632 --> 09:10.217
We're here!

09:10.717 --> 09:14.555
Hey. Hey, guys. Wow, Joe, nice haircut.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.639
- See?
- See?

09:15.639 --> 09:17.224
I miss his old hair.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.143
It's cute. He looks like Tom Cruise
in <i>A Few Good Men.</i>

09:20.227 --> 09:22.479
I wouldn't mind cruising a few good men.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.568
Again, I'm sorry. I spend all my time
at kids' birthday parties.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.361
We're really probably better
than this now, right?

09:29.945 --> 09:32.239
Anyways, we brought you
a housewarming gift.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.449
Jay deserves all the credit.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.451
- Close your eyes.
- Maybe never open them.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.999
Ta-da!

09:41.999 --> 09:43.458
He's an old-time barkeep.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.503
Now, check it out.
He's a big guy like Cam.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.547
And he's got red hair, like you.

09:48.547 --> 09:53.135
Dad! This is exactly what we needed,
a little whimsy! I love it!

09:53.135 --> 09:55.888
No, you don't. Other gays, tell him.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.973
- We love it.
- So cheeky.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.058
We're gonna have so much fun
with this guy.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.978
We can throw an Uncle Sam hat
on him for the Fourth of July,

10:02.978 --> 10:04.605
a pilgrim hat for Thanksgiving.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.440
Or a rainbow wig for Pride.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.984
Well, it's a piece of art.
I don't think you want to make it silly.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.069
So, does this, uh, big fella have a name?

10:11.153 --> 10:14.823
Sure does. Since he's a combo
of Cam and Mitch, he's Kitsch!

10:16.033 --> 10:18.869
Yes, he is. Dad, it's perfect.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.456
Great. Now, Mitchell is even happier.
I'm gonna die in this house.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.712
- Hi.
- Alex, hi. Come in, have a seat.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.467
- So, uh...
- So, I guess I'll just get right into it.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.845
I... I didn't see this coming
when I asked you to work with me,

10:36.929 --> 10:40.516
and I guess I'm sort of afraid
how you... How you might react,

10:40.516 --> 10:43.268
which explains
why I'm acting so awkwardly,

10:43.352 --> 10:45.395
and why this sentence won't seem to end,

10:45.479 --> 10:47.773
which is so delightful
when Hugh Grant does it,

10:47.773 --> 10:48.899
I just sound like a raving...

10:48.899 --> 10:50.567
- Let me stop you.
- Please do.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.446
I think I know what you're trying to say.

10:54.530 --> 10:59.618
Uh, it appears there's some
romantic tension between us,

10:59.618 --> 11:01.662
and you're afraid
that once I sign my contract,

11:01.662 --> 11:03.455
we won't be able to act on it.

11:03.539 --> 11:04.665
Uh...

11:04.665 --> 11:07.125
Actually, I was...
I was just going to tell you

11:07.209 --> 11:09.586
that our project
has been moved to Switzerland.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.215
Damn it, Haley!

11:13.215 --> 11:15.801
Then why were you hemming and hawing,
and bringing up Hugh Grant,

11:15.801 --> 11:17.636
which takes every girl right to rom-com?

11:17.636 --> 11:21.682
Well, I was afraid that you wouldn't
want to move so far, and...

11:21.682 --> 11:24.643
And I feel responsible
for you quitting your job.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.479
Forget what I said!
So, uh, Switzerland, huh?

11:27.563 --> 11:29.898
- Do they pay for housing?
- Uh, actually, yeah.

11:29.982 --> 11:33.151
Perfect, perfect.
That solves a big problem for me.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.612
Yup, count me in. See you at the airport.

11:35.696 --> 11:39.533
Oh, hold on. Seems like there's something
that we should circle back to.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.617
No, no. No, I'm fine.

11:40.701 --> 11:44.329
Alex, I've never considered
a romantic relationship with you.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.498
- Oh, great, let's relive it.
- I mean, I'm so much older.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.251
- I dated your sister.
- All good reasons.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.587
- I'm at a meter, so...
- But if it's something

11:51.587 --> 11:54.965
that isn't completely out of the realm
of possibility for you,

11:54.965 --> 11:58.844
then I'd be lying if I said it was out
of the realm of possibility for me.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.057
- Oh.
- So, let's go back.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.810
You're saying that if we had
a pre-existing relationship,

12:06.894 --> 12:11.315
or rather a relationship that existed
in a quantum state, like, to entangle...

12:11.315 --> 12:15.152
You don't have to dumb it down,
but... But, yes.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.779
We'd be good to go, legally speaking.

12:18.363 --> 12:19.406
Huh.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.910
Well, then, maybe
we should create evidence now

12:22.910 --> 12:25.662
of a relationship that may
or may not happen later.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.289
What kind of evidence?

12:27.289 --> 12:31.335
I suppose we could exchange saucy texts.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.586
- Seems logical.
- Yeah.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.005
Okay.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.804
- "You look beautiful today"?
- Is that too much?

12:42.888 --> 12:45.390
No. No, no, no, but maybe delete mine...

12:45.474 --> 12:49.520
Oh, my God! You're so much
better at this than I am!

12:49.520 --> 12:50.938
Shouldn't have sent it.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.525
- Hello, you two.
- Hey.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.985
- How about a little quiche?
- Oh. How European.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.612
Muah. Muah.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.781
Oh, Ronaldo, what's your secret?

13:01.657 --> 13:03.659
Cam got offered
that coaching job in Missouri,

13:03.659 --> 13:05.536
and Pepper got his eighth face lift!

13:05.536 --> 13:06.870
- What?
- I know.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.038
We don't buy soup anymore

13:08.038 --> 13:10.082
because he can't
close his mouth all the way.

13:10.082 --> 13:13.252
- Cam, you got the job?
- And you're moving.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.087
Damn it, Ronaldo! Apparently,
Pepper's not the only one

13:15.087 --> 13:16.672
who can't keep his mouth closed.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.507
Go, serve your little apps.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.636
- I can't believe this.
- Okay, don't panic.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.763
I'm... I'm going to turn it down.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.807
Really? But it's what
you've always wanted.

13:26.807 --> 13:30.435
I know, but Mitchell, he's...
I've never seen him so happy.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.729
And I can't ruin that. I'm...

13:32.813 --> 13:34.857
I'm not even going to tell him
I got the offer.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.568
Look, I am not a fan of the idea
of you guys leaving,

13:37.568 --> 13:40.404
but if you don't tell Mitchell,
you're going to end up resenting him.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.573
No, that's... That's not how I'm built.

13:42.573 --> 13:46.076
I make decisions, move forward,
don't look back. No regrets.

13:47.244 --> 13:51.290
Hey, everyone, I just want to thank you
all for coming to see our new home,

13:51.290 --> 13:53.876
and meet our precious
new roommate, Rexford.

13:53.876 --> 13:54.960
Aw!

13:54.960 --> 13:57.838
And I also want to thank
my wonderful husband,

13:57.838 --> 14:00.841
Cam, who really led the charge
and made of all this possible. I...

14:01.383 --> 14:04.595
I couldn't be happier right now,
and it's all because of him.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.764
Now, if I could just get him
to give up hogging the covers, huh?

14:10.642 --> 14:12.352
'Cause I haven't given up enough for you!

14:14.104 --> 14:15.397
This is so embarrassing.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.567
I just realized Ronaldo
was offering me quiche.

14:22.154 --> 14:25.407
So, you were never going to tell me
you got offered the job?

14:25.407 --> 14:29.036
It's just that you just seemed so happy,
and I couldn't ask you to give that up.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.830
Cam, you've been wanting
to move closer to your family for years.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.833
And this is your dream job. No.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.503
This is my chance to be there for you.

14:37.503 --> 14:38.712
Are you sure?

14:40.172 --> 14:44.134
I... I don't care where we live,
as long as you're there by my side.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.219
Always.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.720
Aw!

14:49.014 --> 14:51.141
All right. Now, let's celebrate
with some champagne.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.351
Yeah.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.063
Mitchell... Mitchell, that was beautiful.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.941
Well, everyone was looking at me,
what the was I supposed to say?

15:06.198 --> 15:07.574
How are you feeling?

15:07.658 --> 15:10.285
Uh, it's gonna be weird without them
being here all the time.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.620
Plus, they got the new kid.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.331
Poor guy's gonna grow up
with those Missouri closets,

15:14.331 --> 15:15.999
thinking that's normal.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.961
It was so sweet how Mitch
didn't have to think twice about going.

15:18.961 --> 15:22.047
Well, it's like he said,
it's his turn to support Cam.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.675
Almost the same thing
I'm trying to do for you,

15:24.675 --> 15:25.968
except I'm pissing you off.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.679
Because you won't do anything
the way that I would do it!

15:28.679 --> 15:31.139
- I don't see anyone else complaining.
- That's the worst part.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.392
That nobody needs me! It's 2020.

15:33.392 --> 15:36.687
I shouldn't be losing jobs
to an old white man.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.817
When Manny gets homesick,
who do you think he's going to call?

15:42.526 --> 15:44.987
When Joe has a nightmare,
who does he want?

15:45.696 --> 15:48.615
And when I'm sitting here,
already sad about Mitchell leaving,

15:48.699 --> 15:51.076
who do you think I want
to walk into this room?

15:51.493 --> 15:52.911
- Me?
- Of course.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.872
And I think I know what's going on here.

15:54.872 --> 15:57.249
You're feeling guilty
about working. Don't.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.171
Do you think I ever felt guilty working
while you held down the fort here?

16:02.171 --> 16:04.756
- You sure didn't.
- No, and now it's time for you

16:04.840 --> 16:06.884
to go out into the world and crush it.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.761
While you hold down the fort
and look pretty?

16:09.845 --> 16:12.848
Well, I'm not just a sex object.
I have other gifts.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.226
Oh.

16:16.894 --> 16:18.520
- That was a crazy day.
- Yeah.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.606
I'm going to be up for a while tonight.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.232
You want to buckle yourself into bed

16:22.316 --> 16:23.317
and I'll drive you around

16:23.317 --> 16:24.401
until you fall asleep?

16:26.612 --> 16:30.157
You know, I...
I don't want to sleep in the driveway.

16:30.157 --> 16:35.037
I don't. I want to sleep in our house
with our kids, all of them.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.415
With what's going on
with Mitchell and Cam,

16:38.415 --> 16:40.918
I just feel like we're losing
enough family as it is.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.754
Funny. I was feeling that, too.

16:43.754 --> 16:44.922
Mmm.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.965
- You came down so hard on them earlier.
- Mmm.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.426
- I'll go give them the good news.
- Like hell you will!

16:51.553 --> 16:52.554
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:52.638 --> 16:53.639
Oh, good, you're home.

16:53.639 --> 16:54.973
Yeah. Are your brother and sister here?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.975
I want to talk about
this whole living situation.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.602
Actually, problem solved.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.437
- I'm moving to Switzerland.
- What?

17:00.521 --> 17:02.231
They're transferring
my research team there.

17:02.231 --> 17:05.567
I get housing and everything,
so you're good.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.611
Like, "hot chocolate" Switzerland?

17:07.611 --> 17:09.905
- Oh, hey, did you tell them our news?
- Uh, just mine.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.699
Dylan and I are moving out, too.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.660
Oh, but you don't have to.

17:14.660 --> 17:18.163
We want to. You guys are right,
it's time for us to go.

17:18.247 --> 17:20.791
We did the math and we realized
we had $1 million.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.919
Then we had Alex check the math,
and turns out we don't,

17:23.919 --> 17:25.462
but we do have enough
for a cute apartment.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.756
Now that they don't test on animals,

17:27.840 --> 17:30.676
I've made extra money
doing clinical trials at work.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.135
The hours are long,

17:32.219 --> 17:33.387
but the mazes are fun.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.681
Sweet, you're all here.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.683
Everyone can relax,
I'll be the one who goes.

17:37.683 --> 17:40.477
- Oh, no, no, Luke, it's okay.
- No, no, no, I lied before.

17:41.144 --> 17:44.147
I actually did hear back
from University of Oregon.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.399
I got in.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.068
- Amazing!
- Oh, honey, that's wonderful.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.028
- We're so proud of you.
- That's amazing, Luke.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.738
Yeah, congrats.

17:52.948 --> 17:56.493
Wait, you're... You're all moving out?

17:56.577 --> 17:57.995
Really, we are?

17:57.995 --> 17:59.663
- Yeah.
- Weird.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.335
Oh, it's Arvin.
Sorry, I've got to respond to it.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.212
It's a work thing.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.799
I've gotta get ready. I've got a date.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.596
- Oh, there they are.
- I bet you're not going to miss that.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.764
Oh, Luke, I'm in here!

18:17.848 --> 18:18.849
What are you doing?

18:18.849 --> 18:20.058
Oh, get out!

18:25.022 --> 18:26.356
I am going to miss this.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.443
Me, too.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.573
Hey. Everybody's gone.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.783
Look...

18:37.784 --> 18:39.161
I haven't called the college yet.

18:39.661 --> 18:43.957
I wanted to talk to you first.
I know you were being generous up there...

18:44.041 --> 18:46.585
You know me, I... I can be happy anywhere.

18:47.294 --> 18:51.215
No, seriously, after some time,
I'll forget all about this place.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.675
We named our son after the street.

18:53.759 --> 18:56.178
So we'll just change his name
to the new street.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.723
The coach's house is at the intersection
of Route 13 and Burnt Corn Lane.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.435
Dear God, what are we doing?
I... I'm not gonna fit in.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.563
What if no one likes me?
What if I can't find a job?

19:06.647 --> 19:09.274
Are there... Are there lattes?
Are there art house theaters?

19:09.358 --> 19:11.109
What if I never see
a black and white movie?

19:11.193 --> 19:12.736
Or a black and white couple?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.988
Hey. Where are we on this move?

19:15.072 --> 19:17.866
That's what Daddy and I are
talking about right now, sweetie.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.868
'Cause I have a major project
due on Tuesday,

19:20.494 --> 19:22.037
and I'm not saying I haven't started it,

19:22.037 --> 19:25.082
but if you asked to see what I've done
so far, there wouldn't be anything.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.792
We're going.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.670
Are you sure?

19:29.670 --> 19:33.715
I'm gonna need a little time
to adjust, but we... We are going.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.928
- Are you okay with that?
- Totally. I'll reinvent myself.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.181
I'm gonna dye my hair blue
and carry around an emotional support pig.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.141
Oh, I know... I know just the pig!

19:43.225 --> 19:44.476
Cam, well, call the college.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.186
Okay, I just want this
to be the right thing.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.647
If this ends up hurting the family,
I would never forgive myself.

19:48.647 --> 19:51.233
No. No, we're stronger than that, okay?
We're gonna be fine.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.860
Yeah.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.862
- Not... Not now, Lily.
- You guys are gonna end up singing.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.238
Just get to it.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.825
Excuse me, young lady,
having a serious conversation here, okay?

19:59.825 --> 20:02.369
Do not reduce us to a couple
of stereotypical...

20:02.369 --> 20:04.246
<i>My love</i>

20:06.582 --> 20:10.419
<i>There's only you in my life</i>

20:11.420 --> 20:15.340
<i>The only thing that's bright</i>

20:15.883 --> 20:17.676
Why do I always
have to sing the female part?

20:18.260 --> 20:21.138
<i>My first love</i>

20:21.930 --> 20:26.393
<i>You're every breath that I take</i>

20:26.894 --> 20:31.064
<i>You're every step I make</i>

20:31.398 --> 20:33.525
Ugh! What was I thinking?

20:33.692 --> 20:38.947
<i>You will always be</i>

20:39.531 --> 20:44.786
<i>My endless love</i>

20:46.747 --> 20:51.293
<i>Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one</i>

20:51.293 --> 20:53.837
Ew, I do not like being
the first person at a party.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.214
Oh, actually, you're the last one.

20:55.214 --> 20:56.507
Yeah, Sal, everybody's gone.

20:56.507 --> 20:59.968
What? Boo! Gays used to be
so fun before kids.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.803
Come on, let's do shots!

21:01.887 --> 21:04.348
You know this house is only
a block from my new place.

21:04.932 --> 21:07.434
Well, it's not "mine,"
but I get to stay there for free

21:07.518 --> 21:10.145
'cause I let the guy
who owns it watch me on web cams.

21:10.229 --> 21:14.149
Boo,
I'm going to be coming over all the time.

21:14.233 --> 21:15.317
Yay!

21:15.317 --> 21:19.488
And, um, Happy Face Emoji here
can babysit my dogs and kid,

21:19.488 --> 21:21.448
and you guys cook, right?

21:22.115 --> 21:23.325
'Cause my gummy's kicking in.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.868
Actually, I'm feeling better
about the move already.

21:24.952 --> 21:25.953
Yeah.
