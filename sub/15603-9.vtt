00:00.926 --> 00:02.669
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.705 --> 00:05.653
You're the worst mistake
my mother ever made.

00:05.813 --> 00:07.698
What happened to her
haunts me every day.

00:07.782 --> 00:11.318
I recognize this flash drive
from the water damage.

00:11.369 --> 00:13.687
What should I bet
that it's the same one

00:13.738 --> 00:15.072
that's involved in the FBI
investigation

00:15.156 --> 00:16.657
into Seth Newman's death?

00:16.708 --> 00:18.075
Missiles
were never here.

00:18.159 --> 00:20.577
Henry probably has them
halfway across the world by now.

00:27.368 --> 00:29.336
I joined the A.L.C.

00:29.387 --> 00:31.538
because I want to know
what happened to my mother.

00:31.589 --> 00:34.041
I'm gonna put a bullet
in Henry Wilcox's head.

00:45.353 --> 00:47.354
I pulled together everything
I thought you might need.

00:47.405 --> 00:49.406
Okay.
Calder swept my apartment.

00:49.490 --> 00:51.558
Has anyone talked to Auggie?
Not yet.

00:51.609 --> 00:52.609
I sent someone
over to his place

00:52.694 --> 00:54.027
to check on him
but he wasn't there.

00:54.078 --> 00:55.478
I think Calder
did something to him.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.447
It's okay.
I'll handle it.

00:57.532 --> 01:00.167
- Where am I headed?
- Copenhagen.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.568
Henry's attending
an energy convention there

01:01.619 --> 01:03.170
with the Solstar people.
Okay.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.905
I better get started,
'cause Teo has a big head start.

01:05.957 --> 01:08.425
Annie,
I need you to know something.

01:08.509 --> 01:10.510
The bombing that Henry
was behind in Turbaco

01:10.578 --> 01:13.380
that killed Teo's mom, this is
the first I'm hearing any of it.

01:13.431 --> 01:16.516
- I understand.
- I need Teo to understand that.

01:16.584 --> 01:19.519
I was working under Henry
when it happened.

01:19.587 --> 01:23.089
I don't want him thinking
I was involved.

01:23.141 --> 01:26.092
Why don't you tell him
yourself when I bring him home?

01:33.868 --> 01:36.453
She'll be able to stop him.
And if she does?

01:36.537 --> 01:40.607
It just gives Henry
more time to plot his next move.

01:40.658 --> 01:43.961
We've got to find a way
to stop this cycle.

03:01.155 --> 03:02.689
- Scotty.
- Henry.

03:02.740 --> 03:03.857
Excuse me.

03:03.908 --> 03:05.876
I'm surprised they let you
back in Denmark

03:05.960 --> 03:08.045
after what happened last time.

03:08.129 --> 03:10.831
Do you know these gentlemen?
Ken Ruiz, Luis Ianez.

03:10.882 --> 03:12.165
Scott Winnick,
nice to meet you.

03:12.216 --> 03:15.168
- Nice to meet you.
- Let us proceed, shall we?

03:17.055 --> 03:20.557
Your name, sir?

03:20.641 --> 03:23.510
- Guillermo Sanchez.
- Sanchez.

03:23.561 --> 03:26.546
All right, Mr. Sanchez,
have a nice day.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.515
Thank you.

03:34.906 --> 03:36.866
Any word from Bogota
on recovering those missiles?

03:36.908 --> 03:38.442
- No.
- How about Calder Michaels?

03:38.526 --> 03:39.576
I haven't been able
to reach him yet,

03:39.660 --> 03:41.244
and I've left
multiple messages.

03:41.329 --> 03:42.250
Should I try him again?

03:42.330 --> 03:45.582
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:30.128 --> 04:31.828
Sunflower seeds?

04:31.913 --> 04:34.831
They're good for you.
Lots of Vitamin E.

04:37.418 --> 04:41.287
So...you got me locked up
in some kind of dungeon?

04:41.339 --> 04:44.591
Did I give you the impression
that you're locked up?

04:51.899 --> 04:54.017
So you're saying
I'm free to leave?

04:54.101 --> 04:56.436
At any time.

04:56.487 --> 04:58.355
All right.

04:58.439 --> 05:01.107
But let me tell you
what happens if you do.

05:01.159 --> 05:06.780
I'd be forced to call the FBI,
the NSA, and the DNI's office.

05:06.831 --> 05:09.866
That's what I'm supposed to do
when I discover

05:09.951 --> 05:13.203
a drive containing
stolen classified intel

05:13.287 --> 05:15.455
in the safe
of one of my operatives.

05:15.506 --> 05:17.507
If I was following
protocol,

05:17.592 --> 05:21.494
there'd already be a mark
on your record so permanent,

05:21.546 --> 05:24.047
even if you were absolved
of any wrong-doing,

05:24.131 --> 05:27.050
you'd be lucky
to get a job at the DMV.

05:32.607 --> 05:36.142
I'm trying to keep your breach
inside the family,

05:36.194 --> 05:38.478
and this dungeon
is your opportunity

05:38.529 --> 05:42.015
to explain yourself before
I'm forced to put you

05:42.066 --> 05:44.517
in the kind of custody
that there's no way out of.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.019
So you're here
as a friend.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.905
You don't realize how much
trouble you're in, do you?

05:51.709 --> 05:54.377
I was there
when Annie abetted

05:54.462 --> 05:57.881
Teo Braga's escape
from CIA custody.

05:57.965 --> 06:01.868
I have video of her meeting
with him again in Vienna,

06:01.919 --> 06:05.088
right before a known gun runner
shows up dead

06:05.172 --> 06:06.640
and five Stingers
go missing.

06:06.707 --> 06:09.676
Then the one A.L.C. member
we have in custody

06:09.727 --> 06:11.177
that can implicate Braga

06:11.229 --> 06:13.597
conveniently dies
during a prison transfer

06:13.681 --> 06:17.651
with Annie Walker literally
behind the wheel.

06:17.718 --> 06:21.438
Auggie, a picture is starting
to form, and it ain't pretty.

06:21.522 --> 06:29.162
Well...If you know so much,
what am I doing here?

06:29.229 --> 06:31.031
Where is Annie Walker?

06:31.082 --> 06:33.533
What is Teo planning to do
with those missiles?

06:33.584 --> 06:35.260
What is
on that flash drive?

06:55.284 --> 06:57.936
Auggie,
you're still not answering.

06:57.987 --> 07:02.107
I'm officially worried
about you now, so call me back.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.335
- There you go.
- Thank you.

07:14.837 --> 07:16.221
Hi, I wonder
if you can help me.

07:16.288 --> 07:17.688
I am doing a piece
on the conference

07:17.724 --> 07:19.257
for <i>Offshore</i> magazine,

07:19.308 --> 07:22.978
and I'm supposed to interview
Ken Ruiz from Solstar Oil.

07:23.062 --> 07:24.796
Unfortunately,
my flight was delayed

07:24.847 --> 07:26.932
and I don't have
his cell phone number.

07:26.983 --> 07:28.800
Can someone point me
in the right direction?

07:28.851 --> 07:30.485
Well,
the whole Solstar team

07:30.570 --> 07:32.971
is actually
at the Tivoli Gardens presently,

07:33.022 --> 07:34.406
scheduled
for a photo op.

07:34.473 --> 07:37.693
Okay, and Henry Wilcox?
He offered to chime in as well.

07:37.777 --> 07:40.478
- He's there too.
- Thanks.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.709
You look like you've done
that before.

07:53.793 --> 07:56.628
Once or twice.

07:56.679 --> 07:58.930
I don't usually have an audience
this time of morning.

07:58.998 --> 08:00.716
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.552
I got a bad habit
of sneaking up on people.

08:03.636 --> 08:05.020
My name is Arthur Campbell.

08:05.104 --> 08:07.139
I know who you are.

08:07.190 --> 08:09.474
I need a lawyer, Ms. Manning.
You've been recommended.

08:09.525 --> 08:11.526
- You realize I have a phone.
- This is urgent.

08:11.611 --> 08:14.863
And I couldn't reach anyone
at your office this morning.

08:14.947 --> 08:16.667
Maybe that's because
it's not even 6:00 yet.

08:16.682 --> 08:19.201
That would explain it.
Anyway,

08:19.285 --> 08:20.535
it's pretty well
established

08:20.620 --> 08:22.037
that you come here
every Wednesday

08:22.121 --> 08:25.690
so I thought, why not present
myself and my dilemma in person?

08:25.742 --> 08:27.859
You're coming on
awfully strong, Arthur.

08:27.910 --> 08:29.161
What are you trying
to wriggle out of?

08:29.212 --> 08:31.246
I'm not trying
to wriggle out of anything.

08:31.330 --> 08:33.865
Not even that affair
you resigned over?

08:33.916 --> 08:35.049
Never happened.

08:35.134 --> 08:37.501
You fabricated
the whole thing?

08:37.553 --> 08:39.921
I'm assuming there's something
pretty explosive behind that.

08:40.006 --> 08:44.342
It's costing too many people
too much to keep my secrets.

08:44.393 --> 08:48.180
So I want to confess my sins,
not cover up anything.

08:51.017 --> 08:55.220
I should take him in
for his morning feed.

08:55.271 --> 08:57.405
Meet me at my office
in 45 minutes.

08:57.490 --> 09:00.408
You can call me Bianca.

09:25.968 --> 09:27.052
See?
Just one.

09:27.103 --> 09:29.304
Ah.

11:44.690 --> 11:46.908
We need to stop meeting
like this, you know?

11:46.993 --> 11:48.576
We don't have time
for this, Teo.

11:48.661 --> 11:51.413
You have to come
with me now.

11:51.497 --> 11:55.033
I don't think so,
but thank you very much.

11:55.084 --> 11:57.035
I haven't seen all the sights
of the city yet.

11:57.086 --> 11:59.587
Are you crazy?
After what just happened,

11:59.672 --> 12:01.673
Copenhagen
is dead to us.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.208
Because you created
the chaos.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.043
If you want to sneak away,
so be it.

12:05.094 --> 12:07.963
If you want to stop me,
you should be prepared

12:08.047 --> 12:10.966
to take better aim
with that gun this time.

12:16.022 --> 12:17.939
I won't let you
kill Henry.

12:18.024 --> 12:21.726
It's the only way to stop him.
You realize that, don't you?

12:21.777 --> 12:23.761
- Find another way.
- There's no other way.

12:23.813 --> 12:26.948
This is it.
This is my destiny.

12:27.033 --> 12:29.451
It was set the day
that bomb killed my mother.

12:29.535 --> 12:32.237
This is not gonna
bring your mother back,

12:32.288 --> 12:34.789
but you have a father
who cares about you,

12:34.874 --> 12:37.542
and doesn't want
to lose you.

12:37.609 --> 12:40.778
It's too late for us.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.415
What about me?

12:43.466 --> 12:44.949
What about you?

12:45.001 --> 12:48.169
I don't want to lose you.

12:48.254 --> 12:50.121
We keep getting pushed together
for a reason.

12:50.172 --> 12:52.257
I think we have something
to learn from one another,

12:52.308 --> 12:54.342
don't you?

12:54.427 --> 12:58.179
It would have been nice
to have met you...

12:58.264 --> 13:00.298
at a different time.

13:01.484 --> 13:03.234
Teo!

13:09.942 --> 13:13.778
Stop! Vend dig om!

13:13.829 --> 13:14.812
Ned på knæ!

13:14.864 --> 13:16.814
Now!

13:30.960 --> 13:32.687
I know how things look.
I'm not naive.

13:32.688 --> 13:36.086
But I still feel if we lay it
all out in the right venue,

13:36.087 --> 13:38.589
in front of the right people,
my actions will be understood.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.059
Maybe not forgiven,
but understood.

13:42.126 --> 13:43.394
What do you think?

13:43.461 --> 13:45.128
That's a hell of a whole lot
to walk back.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.398
Do you understand
the charges you're facing?

13:47.465 --> 13:49.066
Money laundering,
aiding and abetting,

13:49.133 --> 13:51.093
a possible treason charge.
I know what I'm facing,

13:51.135 --> 13:54.021
and I accept
sole responsibility.

13:54.105 --> 13:55.856
Tell me more about Teo.

13:55.941 --> 13:57.324
Over the years
you were supporting him,

13:57.409 --> 14:00.160
what kind of terrorist
activities was he involved in?

14:00.245 --> 14:01.965
- Teo is not a terrorist.
- He was a high-up

14:01.980 --> 14:04.531
in a group that proclaims itself
a terrorist organization.

14:04.616 --> 14:06.784
He was working undercover
at my behest.

14:06.835 --> 14:09.620
- Off-book, unsanctioned.
- He is a foreign asset

14:09.671 --> 14:11.154
who's been providing us
with valuable intel

14:11.206 --> 14:14.625
for over seven years,
who also happens to be my son.

14:14.676 --> 14:16.994
Okay,
let me ask you this.

14:17.045 --> 14:18.829
Has he ever taken the life
of a U.S. citizen?

14:18.880 --> 14:20.381
Because that is
going to determine

14:20.465 --> 14:22.066
whether you are tried
for treason or not.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.001
No.
He's never done that.

14:24.052 --> 14:25.836
Never ever,
or as far as you know never?

14:25.887 --> 14:27.838
Never.

14:27.889 --> 14:30.007
Good.
I'm glad you came to me now.

14:30.058 --> 14:32.676
It's lucky that bomb didn't
go off at the Solstar meeting.

14:32.727 --> 14:34.395
That would have been tough
to dig out from under.

14:34.479 --> 14:37.064
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

14:37.148 --> 14:39.233
Teo stopped it
from happening.

14:39.317 --> 14:41.035
Even better.

14:41.119 --> 14:42.653
We should be able
to shield the rest of this

14:42.704 --> 14:44.989
under some sort
of covert action immunity.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.907
If we can guarantee immunity
for everyone else,

14:46.992 --> 14:49.460
I don't care what happens to me.
Do me a favor.

14:49.527 --> 14:52.212
Don't mention that out loud
to anyone else.

15:00.371 --> 15:03.340
So I assume
'cause you're still here,

15:03.391 --> 15:05.809
you're ready to talk.

15:08.379 --> 15:11.398
You know what was almost
as interesting

15:11.483 --> 15:14.217
as what I found
in your place?

15:14.269 --> 15:18.906
What I didn't find.

15:18.990 --> 15:21.909
There was no sign of Annie
whatsoever.

15:21.993 --> 15:28.032
No toiletries, no toothbrush,
no shoes.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.950
So I'm thinking you two
aren't spending as much time

15:30.035 --> 15:31.669
together as you used to.

15:31.736 --> 15:34.288
Maybe it has something to do
with what it took

15:34.372 --> 15:37.741
to secure that flash drive.

15:37.792 --> 15:41.045
I warned you about a handler
sleeping with his operative.

15:41.096 --> 15:43.847
You should have taken
my advice.

15:43.915 --> 15:48.085
I'm gonna give you
some advice.

15:48.136 --> 15:50.054
You should take
a better acting class.

15:50.105 --> 15:51.972
You say you're holding me

15:52.057 --> 15:54.257
in here to keep things
in the family.

15:54.309 --> 15:55.943
I call bullshit.

15:56.027 --> 15:57.260
You're holding me here

15:57.312 --> 15:58.979
'cause you're afraid
to call in the FBI.

15:59.064 --> 16:00.984
You don't want them to know
what's on that drive.

16:01.032 --> 16:03.117
In fact,
unless you're gonna kill me,

16:03.201 --> 16:05.035
I'm willing to bet
you're gonna let me walk

16:05.103 --> 16:06.870
by the end of the day
for lack of evidence.

16:06.938 --> 16:08.288
- Lack of evidence?
- Oh, come on, Calder.

16:08.373 --> 16:09.790
No one's ever going to see
that drive again.

16:09.874 --> 16:12.159
You're gonna figure out a way
to make it magically disappear,

16:12.243 --> 16:14.461
just like your boss wanted
all along.

16:14.546 --> 16:17.414
My boss?

16:19.084 --> 16:23.303
I don't know what assumption
you're operating under,

16:23.388 --> 16:26.724
but the only agenda
I have here is the truth.

16:26.791 --> 16:29.126
Yeah?

16:29.177 --> 16:31.128
Prove it.

16:41.305 --> 16:43.407
Harry,
where's the drive?

16:43.474 --> 16:44.975
We haven't got too far
with the file yet.

16:45.026 --> 16:46.546
We're still chipping away
at the edges.

16:46.611 --> 16:48.362
Yeah, yeah,
just show me the drive.

16:48.446 --> 16:50.581
You're looking at it.
Those ones and zeros,

16:50.648 --> 16:51.749
that's what we're
trying to decrypt.

16:51.816 --> 16:53.000
Am I speaking
a foreign language?

16:53.084 --> 16:54.651
- I don't understand.
- He's looking

16:54.702 --> 16:58.255
for the actual USB storage jump,
Harry, if you know where it is.

16:58.322 --> 17:02.459
Yeah, sure.
I believe it's over here.

17:02.510 --> 17:04.294
I haven't seen it since
we uploaded the file though.

17:04.345 --> 17:06.964
And here we go.

17:07.015 --> 17:09.165
Got it.

17:13.671 --> 17:16.607
You gonna help him
decrypt this?

17:21.012 --> 17:22.695
What algorithm
are you running?

17:22.781 --> 17:25.315
Rijndael, 128-bit.

17:25.366 --> 17:28.535
Try hex 7.

17:35.827 --> 17:38.528
It worked.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.965
Who here's cleared
for SCI-13 intel?

17:42.033 --> 17:44.301
Beat it, Harry.

17:55.730 --> 17:59.216
- Can you make anything out?
- Not yet.

18:07.192 --> 18:10.244
Why is Henry Wilcox meeting
with an A.L.C. terrorist?

18:13.531 --> 18:16.399
What's a freelance journalist
doing with a firearm?

18:16.451 --> 18:20.120
You understand guns are banned
in this country, don't you?

18:20.205 --> 18:21.872
I'd like to call
the U.S. embassy.

18:21.923 --> 18:23.757
The registrar
from the conference

18:23.842 --> 18:25.759
said you were looking
for an executive

18:25.844 --> 18:30.714
working for Solstar Oil.
Was he the target?

18:55.540 --> 18:58.458
You are free to go.

19:16.728 --> 19:18.428
Hop in.

19:18.479 --> 19:20.731
I think we're going
in the same direction.

19:20.798 --> 19:22.966
It's okay, I'll walk.

19:23.034 --> 19:25.319
You lost five Stinger missiles
in Lyon.

19:25.403 --> 19:29.106
Don't you want to know
where they're headed?

19:29.157 --> 19:31.408
I suspect
you have some questions.

19:31.475 --> 19:35.162
If you want the answers,
ride with me.

19:35.246 --> 19:37.331
You think I would
get in a car with you

19:37.415 --> 19:38.665
after all we've
been through?

19:38.750 --> 19:42.485
- You don't trust me?
- Not even a little.

19:44.155 --> 19:47.007
I hate having to resort
to flexing muscle.

19:47.091 --> 19:49.593
It seems beneath us.

19:49.660 --> 19:52.095
But if you won't
play along--

19:59.354 --> 20:01.939
Where are we going?

20:02.006 --> 20:04.191
I do enjoy
the way your mind works.

20:04.275 --> 20:07.728
Most people would have asked,
"where are you taking me?"

20:07.812 --> 20:10.781
A subconscious reaction
to their lost power.

20:10.848 --> 20:12.649
But you haven't
ceded that yet.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.318
I really didn't
think about it that much.

20:14.369 --> 20:17.037
No, you didn't.

20:17.121 --> 20:20.040
Get in the car.

20:59.155 --> 21:01.873
You believe in free will,
Annie?

21:01.940 --> 21:03.775
Oh, come on, there's no
right or wrong answer.

21:03.826 --> 21:07.412
I won't be judging
your response.

21:07.463 --> 21:10.715
I'm not even sure where I stand.
Let me reframe the question:

21:10.783 --> 21:13.117
How do you think you arrived
at this point?

21:13.169 --> 21:15.053
Your men practically
forced me here.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.640
No, I'm talking about what
you're doing in Copenhagen.

21:18.724 --> 21:21.176
It's apparent from what happened
in the gardens

21:21.260 --> 21:25.180
that you came to stop Teo
from killing me.

21:25.264 --> 21:28.683
Did you ever imagine that you'd
spend this much energy

21:28.768 --> 21:31.236
trying to save my life?

21:31.303 --> 21:34.656
Paradox of free will.
You make choice after choice

21:34.740 --> 21:38.159
and suddenly, you reach
this strange dead end

21:38.244 --> 21:41.746
where you're working actively
against your own interests.

21:44.316 --> 21:48.787
Failure to dispassionately see
the whole chessboard.

21:48.838 --> 21:52.290
That's your fatal flaw
as an operative.

21:52.341 --> 21:54.592
You lead with your heart
instead of your head.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.011
You're right, I've made
some decisions I regret,

21:57.096 --> 22:00.598
and in fact, to show you how
much I respect your counsel,

22:00.666 --> 22:02.834
I'm going to change my mind
and let Teo kill you.

22:02.885 --> 22:04.502
Oh, no, it's too late
for that, Annie.

22:04.553 --> 22:06.604
You don't always get
second chances.

22:06.672 --> 22:08.673
You're going to have to deal
with the consequences

22:08.724 --> 22:11.025
of that choice
soon enough.

22:23.038 --> 22:25.690
What do you mean you don't
know where she's being detained?

22:25.741 --> 22:27.492
That's unacceptable.

22:27.543 --> 22:29.360
I want an answer
and a strategy

22:29.412 --> 22:32.664
on getting her out of custody
by the top of the hour.

22:35.384 --> 22:38.035
- They're outside.
- Send them in.

22:45.344 --> 22:49.314
Care to explain where you've
been for the last 15 hours?

22:49.381 --> 22:51.850
Eating sunflower seeds
in Calder's dungeon.

22:51.901 --> 22:53.902
I think I'd like to hear this
from Calder.

22:53.986 --> 22:56.104
On the heels of what happened
to Eduardo Vargas,

22:56.188 --> 22:57.906
I ordered a sweep
of both Officer Walker

22:57.990 --> 22:59.941
and Officer Anderson's
apartments,

23:00.025 --> 23:02.777
a sweep that uncovered
classified intel

23:02.862 --> 23:06.247
removed illegally
from Langley on this.

23:06.332 --> 23:10.418
I sequestered Officer Anderson
in the Mclean off-site

23:10.503 --> 23:13.171
until I could determine
exactly what was on that file.

23:13.238 --> 23:16.291
I decrypted it for him.

23:17.877 --> 23:20.178
I referenced the server

23:20.245 --> 23:23.965
that image was originally
downloaded from

23:24.049 --> 23:26.083
and the entire file's
been erased.

23:26.135 --> 23:28.052
I want to know who did that,
and I want to know

23:28.103 --> 23:31.689
why Seth Newman
was in possession of it.

23:31.757 --> 23:33.942
- You want answers?
- I do.

23:34.026 --> 23:35.360
Well, you're gonna be lucky
not to get

23:35.427 --> 23:37.695
drummed out of here
on your ass.

23:37.763 --> 23:39.364
Sequestering
a fellow operative?

23:39.431 --> 23:42.450
He was given the opportunity
to walk out at any time.

23:42.535 --> 23:45.570
You can expect a response
extremely punitive in nature.

23:45.621 --> 23:46.621
I will get the truth.

23:46.705 --> 23:49.624
You are dismissed.

23:56.448 --> 23:58.633
Are his actions making
any sense to you?

23:58.717 --> 24:00.969
His actions have never
made sense to me.

24:01.053 --> 24:02.303
If he's working for Henry,

24:02.388 --> 24:04.923
why's he driving so hard
to get that photo into play?

24:04.974 --> 24:06.174
We've all been under
the assumption

24:06.258 --> 24:10.061
that Calder was
in league with Henry.

24:10.128 --> 24:12.146
What if we're wrong?

24:12.231 --> 24:14.816
Still doesn't mean
we can trust him.

24:16.134 --> 24:19.971
Bogota is on two.

24:20.022 --> 24:23.741
Yeah?

24:23.809 --> 24:27.328
What's that
supposed to mean?

24:27.413 --> 24:30.331
Then keep looking.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.036
The Stingers?

24:35.120 --> 24:37.505
They found a crate
in the hold of a cargo ship.

24:37.590 --> 24:40.592
Same serial numbers as the ones
Stavros was peddling in Vienna.

24:40.659 --> 24:41.793
Then what are they still
looking for?

24:41.844 --> 24:43.678
There's only four
in that crate.

24:43.762 --> 24:45.797
There's still one missile
unaccounted for.

24:45.848 --> 24:48.800
Where's Annie?

25:00.896 --> 25:03.314
I have to give you credit.

25:03.365 --> 25:07.118
You put up a good fight,
forced me to dig deep.

25:07.185 --> 25:10.872
I thought I almost lost
the opportunity to play my hand.

25:10.956 --> 25:15.526
I mean, telling the world
Arthur's got a bastard son

25:15.578 --> 25:18.329
is no fun if it's only
good for gossip.

25:18.380 --> 25:22.000
Ah, ha ha.
On time.

25:22.051 --> 25:24.969
Yes.
There's a deep water rig

25:25.037 --> 25:26.304
out in the North Sea.

25:26.371 --> 25:29.173
They're shuttling people out
for aerial tours.

25:29.224 --> 25:31.726
Here, take a look.

25:34.396 --> 25:35.897
If you look
closely enough,

25:35.981 --> 25:39.100
you can see the group that's
boarding for the next flight.

25:39.184 --> 25:41.486
Perhaps you recognize
some of them.

25:41.553 --> 25:43.571
- Solstar.
- Yeah.

25:43.656 --> 25:46.991
Kenny and Luis
and the rest of the guys.

25:47.059 --> 25:48.726
I'm supposed to be
on board as well,

25:48.777 --> 25:52.447
but I gave my spot up
to Scott Winnick.

25:52.531 --> 25:55.333
You see the one
wearing the red tie?

25:55.400 --> 25:57.752
He's a nice man.

25:57.836 --> 26:02.590
Oh, and he's also the U.S.
Under Secretary of Energy.

26:02.675 --> 26:05.076
Some of these people were
targeted by the A.L.C.

26:05.127 --> 26:08.212
Last month in the bombing
attempt in Medellin.

26:08.263 --> 26:10.682
If they were aware
that Teo Braga was here,

26:10.749 --> 26:13.801
they'd probably be canceling
this junket altogether,

26:13.886 --> 26:17.305
but who could ever imagine
the Puma

26:17.389 --> 26:20.441
exporting his brand
of terrorism to Denmark?

26:23.362 --> 26:25.730
The D.E.A. wanted
more boots on the ground

26:25.781 --> 26:27.365
to combat the cartels.

26:27.432 --> 26:30.318
We planted the bombs
at Turbaco--

26:30.402 --> 26:32.436
the one that killed
Teo's mother--

26:32.488 --> 26:34.906
to force the Colombian
government's hand.

26:34.957 --> 26:39.043
Who'd have figured it would
pay off all these years later?

26:39.111 --> 26:41.111
I wouldn't have been able
to draw him to Copenhagen

26:41.113 --> 26:43.047
any other way.

26:43.115 --> 26:45.967
Revenge is such
a powerful motivator.

26:46.051 --> 26:48.553
I know that
from personal experience.

26:51.423 --> 26:52.790
Nah, ah ah ah.

26:52.841 --> 26:55.176
Whatever you're plotting,
it's not gonna work.

26:55.260 --> 26:58.096
We know about your involvement
with Eduardo Vargas.

26:58.147 --> 26:59.764
Oh.

26:59.815 --> 27:01.816
It's too bad he can't tell
anyone else about it.

27:01.900 --> 27:02.967
We have a photo as well.

27:03.018 --> 27:04.986
You mean the one
from Seth's drive?

27:05.070 --> 27:08.740
I think I'll be able
to walk that back.

27:08.807 --> 27:11.642
You're not gonna win this,
Henry.

27:11.694 --> 27:13.811
Did you think
we were playing a game?

27:13.862 --> 27:16.614
If you sabotage
that helicopter,

27:16.665 --> 27:17.999
you will fry for it.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.785
I'm not gonna sabotage
anything.

27:20.836 --> 27:22.837
Teo's going to do that,

27:22.921 --> 27:27.158
and Arthur's gonna be
the one frying.

27:27.209 --> 27:29.160
Let her go.

28:20.287 --> 28:21.213
Teo!

28:21.238 --> 28:23.223
Teo!

28:23.224 --> 28:24.307
Wake up.

28:24.391 --> 28:26.059
Come on.

28:29.063 --> 28:31.598
We gotta go.

28:31.649 --> 28:33.399
Please. Run.

29:40.351 --> 29:41.935
Teo!

29:44.606 --> 29:46.190
Let's go.
Let's go!

29:47.275 --> 29:48.892
Let's go!

30:06.494 --> 30:07.711
How's your head?
Are you okay?

30:07.795 --> 30:08.862
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

30:08.913 --> 30:10.881
We gotta ditch this car.

30:10.965 --> 30:12.885
I parked a clean one
just a few blocks from here.

30:12.917 --> 30:15.669
Just go straight,
and we make a left up there.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.371
- Teo.
- Just go straight.

30:18.423 --> 30:20.373
Okay.

30:24.812 --> 30:26.513
The person you
are trying to reach is curr--

30:36.491 --> 30:37.991
The person
you are trying to reach

30:38.059 --> 30:39.743
is currently unavailable.

30:51.005 --> 30:52.172
The person
you are trying to reach

30:52.240 --> 30:53.423
is currently unavailable.

30:57.545 --> 30:58.929
Damn it.

31:05.270 --> 31:07.587
- Hey, Auggie.
- Hey, what's going on?

31:07.639 --> 31:09.306
A helicopter just got
taken out in Copenhagen

31:09.390 --> 31:10.440
by a Stinger missile.

31:10.525 --> 31:13.443
Six reported dead.

31:18.950 --> 31:20.284
Just park here.

31:20.368 --> 31:22.936
Here, to the right.

31:30.278 --> 31:32.746
Okay, I can't walk.

31:36.617 --> 31:39.052
- You got the keys?
- Yeah.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.306
- Come on.
- That's the car.

31:53.351 --> 31:55.402
The assistant A.G.
we're going to talk to

31:55.469 --> 31:57.487
has been a good friend of mine
since undergrad.

31:57.572 --> 31:59.573
His parents both worked
in the intelligence community,

31:59.640 --> 32:01.858
so he'll be sympathetic
to the challenges you face.

32:01.943 --> 32:05.245
Sounds good.

32:05.313 --> 32:07.447
I want you to be open
with him, okay?

32:07.498 --> 32:09.166
Just like you told it
to me.

32:09.250 --> 32:10.667
I will shut down
any line of questioning

32:10.752 --> 32:11.868
that veers off course.

32:11.953 --> 32:13.420
Otherwise,
answer everything truthfully,

32:13.487 --> 32:15.289
especially with regards
to Teo.

32:16.341 --> 32:19.626
Oh.
I'll turn this off.

32:22.130 --> 32:23.797
- Bianca.
- Peter,

32:23.848 --> 32:26.350
thanks for carving out the time
so quickly.

32:26.434 --> 32:28.001
Arthur?

32:28.052 --> 32:31.104
I'm gonna
have to reschedule.

32:31.172 --> 32:32.672
Are you serious?

32:32.724 --> 32:35.525
I thought you said
this couldn't wait.

32:35.610 --> 32:37.778
This is not the way
to make a first impression.

32:37.845 --> 32:40.781
I'm sorry.

32:41.849 --> 32:42.783
How is he?

32:42.850 --> 32:44.184
Not good.

32:44.235 --> 32:45.285
He took a bullet
to the upper thigh,

32:45.353 --> 32:46.519
and he's lost
a lot of blood.

32:46.571 --> 32:48.188
I applied a tourniquet
and some field dressing,

32:48.239 --> 32:50.490
but it's definitely
temporary.

32:50.541 --> 32:51.875
And where are you now?

32:51.959 --> 32:53.377
Outside Ringsted.

32:53.461 --> 32:55.362
We should really get
to the closest hospital.

32:55.413 --> 32:57.197
- No, not a chance.
- Teo,

32:57.248 --> 33:00.133
you're not thinking clearly.
I'm not Teo,

33:00.201 --> 33:02.836
at least not for the people
looking for me.

33:02.887 --> 33:04.971
I'm the Puma,
a fugitive.

33:05.039 --> 33:06.873
If you take me
to a Danish hospital,

33:06.924 --> 33:10.560
I'll never leave
as a free man.

33:10.645 --> 33:12.229
And I'd rather die
on the run

33:12.313 --> 33:15.232
than just living
like some kind of caged animal.

33:15.316 --> 33:17.150
- He's stubborn.
- Just like his father.

33:17.218 --> 33:19.770
How long do you think he can
make it with the wounds he has?

33:19.854 --> 33:22.606
12 hours,
if the stitches hold.

33:22.690 --> 33:24.991
Do you think you can make it
across the border to Germany?

33:25.059 --> 33:26.993
- Why?
- There's an army base

33:27.061 --> 33:30.697
in Schweinfurt, about nine,
ten hours from where you are.

33:30.748 --> 33:33.333
Getting there is like
making it onto U.S. soil.

33:33.401 --> 33:36.203
I'll have a lot more control
on how you two are treated.

33:36.254 --> 33:38.255
Okay.

33:38.339 --> 33:39.756
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

33:39.841 --> 33:41.958
- Let's go.
- Joan,

33:42.043 --> 33:44.511
the guy who fired
the Stinger missile for Henry

33:44.578 --> 33:47.931
is the same guy who ran us
off the road in West Virginia.

33:48.015 --> 33:52.469
Okay, I'll get into it.
Good luck, Annie.

33:55.423 --> 33:56.773
Buckle up.

33:56.858 --> 33:59.776
It's gonna be a long ride.

34:05.650 --> 34:08.435
Let me know
if you get tired.

34:08.485 --> 34:11.438
I'll be happy to drive.

34:34.821 --> 34:36.172
Hey.

34:36.847 --> 34:38.482
Hey, you're supposed to be
keeping me company, remember?

34:38.533 --> 34:41.518
What? Yeah.

34:41.869 --> 34:45.338
What do you want
to talk about?

34:45.422 --> 34:47.657
Tell me about your father.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.007
What do you want to know?

34:49.092 --> 34:52.011
What's your earliest memory
of him?

34:53.664 --> 34:57.667
I must have been
around four or five

34:57.718 --> 35:01.354
when he came
down to Colombia,

35:01.439 --> 35:04.107
and I remember
that we were at the beach,

35:04.174 --> 35:06.943
the three of us
with my mom.

35:07.010 --> 35:11.281
And he tell me
about all the places he flew,

35:11.348 --> 35:15.702
and all the places
he wanted to show me.

35:17.238 --> 35:21.157
I remember how he used to
look at my mother.

35:21.208 --> 35:24.160
He adores her.

35:24.211 --> 35:29.699
At the same time,
there was gravity to him.

35:29.750 --> 35:34.137
Like if he was carrying
a great weight.

35:34.204 --> 35:35.872
At that time,
I thought it was because

35:35.923 --> 35:41.177
he was just another
stiff American, but no.

35:41.228 --> 35:45.682
Now, I know,
because...

35:45.733 --> 35:49.652
I see it in my own eyes
when I look at the mirror.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.355
Once you decide
to do what we do,

35:52.406 --> 35:56.493
it's impossible ever again
to be free of care.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.163
I miss that feeling.
Don't you?

36:03.701 --> 36:07.003
- I'm sorry, Teo.
- About what?

36:07.070 --> 36:09.339
I shouldn't have tried
to stop you from killing Henry,

36:09.406 --> 36:10.740
I made a mistake.

36:10.791 --> 36:13.242
I'm the one
who should be sorry.

36:13.294 --> 36:17.931
Beautiful woman tells you that
she doesn't want to lose you,

36:18.015 --> 36:20.884
and you still jump
off a rooftop?

36:20.935 --> 36:24.888
I must be completely crazy.

36:33.814 --> 36:37.617
I'm not sure
what you know or not,

36:37.701 --> 36:41.621
but it doesn't look good
for your girl out there.

36:41.705 --> 36:44.324
That Stinger was in Stavros's
possession when he was killed,

36:44.408 --> 36:48.277
and Annie's fingerprints
are figuratively all over it.

36:48.329 --> 36:50.079
Okay, is there
a point to this?

36:50.130 --> 36:52.465
'Cause if not,
I have to get back to work.

36:52.550 --> 36:55.251
There's no work
for you to get back to, Auggie.

36:55.302 --> 36:56.982
They're placing you and Annie
under review.

36:57.004 --> 36:58.454
Well, until I hear that
from Joan,

36:58.506 --> 37:00.306
I'm gonna have to assume
you're full of shit.

37:00.391 --> 37:02.926
I just heard it
from the D.C.I.,

37:02.977 --> 37:03.977
two minutes ago.

37:04.061 --> 37:06.729
And you came down here
to what, gloat?

37:06.797 --> 37:08.765
Whose side are you on?

37:10.768 --> 37:13.686
You should know me
well enough by now.

37:16.490 --> 37:19.943
I don't play sides.

37:32.256 --> 37:33.840
My name is Annie Walker.

37:33.924 --> 37:36.175
The Director of Clandestine
Services should have--

37:36.260 --> 37:38.494
thank you.

37:43.350 --> 37:45.018
Right here!
Right here!

37:45.102 --> 37:47.437
Joan called me.
I took the first flight over.

37:47.504 --> 37:49.305
Get your arm over my shoulder,
buddy.

37:49.356 --> 37:52.609
That's it.
It's good to see you.

37:52.676 --> 37:54.343
You're gonna be fine.

37:54.395 --> 37:56.779
I'm Arthur Campbell,
former D.C.S of the CIA

37:56.847 --> 37:59.115
and a career Navy man.
We require immediate assistance.

37:59.182 --> 38:00.400
- What happened?
- Shot in the leg.

38:00.484 --> 38:01.784
- Shattered femur.
- He's lost a lot of blood.

38:01.852 --> 38:02.902
Start a bag of saline.

38:02.987 --> 38:04.520
Prep room three
for surgery, stat.

38:04.572 --> 38:07.040
- Who's the patient?
- This is my son, Teo Campbell.

38:07.124 --> 38:08.357
I messed up
pretty good, huh?

38:08.409 --> 38:09.959
No, it's okay,
these are good doctors.

38:10.027 --> 38:12.528
I think my days being
undercover might be behind me.

38:12.580 --> 38:15.164
Don't worry about that now.
You just get better.

38:15.215 --> 38:17.634
You think you can find
something for me in D.C.?

38:17.701 --> 38:19.052
- Absolutely.
- Sir.

38:19.136 --> 38:20.420
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:20.504 --> 38:22.672
All right.
All right.

38:33.267 --> 38:36.986
Annie, I can't thank you
enough for bringing my boy back.

38:39.056 --> 38:41.858
Annie?

38:44.828 --> 38:46.663
Why did you leave
the base?

38:46.730 --> 38:48.247
Joan was arranging
to bring you in.

38:48.332 --> 38:49.693
I don't know
who I can trust there.

38:49.733 --> 38:52.001
Henry has too many allies
that we can't account for.

38:52.069 --> 38:54.921
Well, he may not have
as many as we thought.

38:55.005 --> 38:57.740
Turns out Calder's not working
for Henry after all.

38:57.791 --> 39:00.510
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

39:00.577 --> 39:03.096
Do you think
Calder would believe us?

39:03.180 --> 39:05.298
I don't know.

39:05.382 --> 39:06.883
Come in and tell your story,
Annie.

39:06.934 --> 39:08.685
It'll be your word
against Henry's.

39:08.752 --> 39:10.520
The truth will prevail.

39:10.587 --> 39:13.222
Do you know that Henry
laid over in Frankfurt

39:13.273 --> 39:15.358
for 36 hours
on his way to Copenhagen?

39:15.425 --> 39:17.894
- So?
- So, why would he do that?

39:17.945 --> 39:19.929
There's a flight every hour.

39:19.980 --> 39:23.032
He must be meeting someone.
I'm gonna find out who.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.702
Annie, your cover's
been I.D.'d by Interpol.

39:25.769 --> 39:27.103
You are a wanted criminal.

39:27.154 --> 39:29.489
It's all right.
I know what to do.

39:29.573 --> 39:31.107
How will I be able
to reach you?

39:31.158 --> 39:33.042
As soon as I get a new
burner cell, I'll call you.

39:33.110 --> 39:37.113
- Okay.
- Hey, Auggie...

39:37.164 --> 39:40.333
It's good to hear
your voice.

39:40.417 --> 39:43.136
Good to hear yours too.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.504
Listen,
I've been thinking,

39:44.588 --> 39:45.972
when this all blows over...

39:46.056 --> 39:47.557
Maybe we could take
some time off, go somewhere.

39:47.624 --> 39:48.758
Go somewhere?

39:48.809 --> 39:50.643
What do you think
about the Galapagos?

39:50.728 --> 39:52.261
Someplace no one
could find us.

39:52.312 --> 39:54.192
Hell, no one's even looking
anywhere near there,

39:54.264 --> 39:58.234
unless Milstar 6 or TacSat-3,
but they've both been repurposed

39:58.301 --> 40:01.637
to collect data
on coastal erosions.

40:01.689 --> 40:03.305
Annie, you still there?

40:03.357 --> 40:05.158
Annie?

40:07.277 --> 40:09.162
Still there?

40:18.255 --> 40:21.257
I was supposed to be
on that helicopter myself.

40:21.324 --> 40:22.992
Those are my friends
and colleagues.

40:23.043 --> 40:25.461
I can only offer my condolences
to the family

40:25.512 --> 40:28.347
of those who lost
their lives today.

40:28.432 --> 40:33.519
I know how hard it is not
to want to lash out in anger.

40:33.604 --> 40:38.174
I've often found solace myself
in the good book.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.349
I'm sorry.

40:57.494 --> 41:00.379
Romans 12:19.

41:00.464 --> 41:04.000
"Avenge not yourself,
dear friends,

41:04.051 --> 41:06.552
"but leave room
for God's wrath,

41:06.637 --> 41:09.205
"for it is written...

41:09.256 --> 41:11.540
Vengeance is mine."
