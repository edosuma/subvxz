If you don't like America,
why don't you get out?

02:03.040 --> 02:04.500
Yeah!

02:04.625 --> 02:06.418
Don't you call us un-American!

02:06.544 --> 02:09.672
This country was founded
on the right to protest, m'kay!

02:09.797 --> 02:11.173
Yeah!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.551
If the founding fathers
saw you burning your flag

02:13.676 --> 02:15.302
and calling the president
a Nazi,

02:15.427 --> 02:16.846
they'd roll over
in their graves!

02:16.971 --> 02:18.347
Yeah!

02:18.472 --> 02:21.767
The founding fathers would agree
with our right to protest.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.603
The founding fathers
would kick all your asses!

02:24.728 --> 02:27.439
Boys, what do you think
the founding fathers would say?

02:29.024 --> 02:30.526
T-The foggy who?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.407
Well, I hope you little commies

02:36.532 --> 02:37.908
are pretty pleased
with yourselves --

02:38.033 --> 02:39.702
going out there
and protesting America

02:39.827 --> 02:41.996
and then saying
on national television

02:42.121 --> 02:44.415
that you don't even know
who the founding fathers are!

02:44.540 --> 02:47.334
You kids don't know squat
about America, do you?!

02:48.836 --> 02:50.713
W-Well, not really, no.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.006
Well, that's just jingles,

02:52.131 --> 02:54.383
because I'm assigning
all you little flag burners

02:54.508 --> 02:58.053
a full report on 1776
and the founding fathers!

02:58.179 --> 02:58.888
Aw!

02:59.013 --> 03:01.348
Shut up! I want you all
in your study groups of four.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.142
And if you can't give
an outstanding report

03:03.267 --> 03:04.768
on what the founding fathers
would have to say

03:04.894 --> 03:08.439
about all this protesting,
then it's F's for you!

03:13.611 --> 03:15.279
Ugh.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.157
Uh-ugh.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.618
I can't do it.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.620
This is way too much material
for a 9-year-old.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.248
Oh, no, you don't, Cartman!

03:26.373 --> 03:27.583
Every time we get put
in a study group,

03:27.708 --> 03:29.585
you sit on ass while the rest
of us do all the work!

03:29.710 --> 03:31.295
But you guys are such
better studiers than me.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.463
I know you can pull it off.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.632
You're gonna read this stuff
and study like the rest of us!

03:40.137 --> 03:42.765
Myaaaa!
Mya, mya.

03:56.403 --> 04:00.950
Hmm, 1776, when our founding
fathers created America.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.577
I wonder what it used to be like
in those days...

04:03.702 --> 04:05.120
in those days...

04:05.246 --> 04:07.623
in those days...in those days.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.832
What are you doing?

04:08.958 --> 04:10.459
I'm trying to have a flashback.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.168
A mrph?

04:11.293 --> 04:12.419
You know, if I have a flashback,

04:12.544 --> 04:15.172
then I can see what 1776
was like firsthand.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.465
No, you just have to study.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.968
No. I've seen this work before.
Just give me a second.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.427
Oh, okay, okay.
How about this?

04:20.552 --> 04:23.138
Say, guys, 1776 was so long ago.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.516
I wonder what life would
have been like back then...

04:25.641 --> 04:27.685
back then...back then...

04:27.810 --> 04:29.019
back then.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.151
Uh...Oh, wait, wait.
I know, I know.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.488
You know, guys,
I don't even care about 1776.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.656
It was so long ago

04:40.781 --> 04:42.825
that I don't think it has
anything to do with me...

04:42.950 --> 04:44.285
with me...

04:44.410 --> 04:46.328
with --
anything to do with me...

04:46.453 --> 04:47.454
with me.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.956
That isn't gonna work, dumbass!

04:49.081 --> 04:51.500
Kids, let's keep it down
for study groups

04:51.625 --> 04:54.169
or else Mr. Garrison's
going to punish me.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.338
Just face it, Cartman.
You're gonna have to study!

04:56.463 --> 04:57.756
Myaaa!

04:57.881 --> 04:59.550
M-M-M-Myaaa!

05:02.720 --> 05:04.013
There.
All finished.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.099
From now on, this is
the pro-war side of town,

05:07.224 --> 05:09.768
and that's the unpatriotic side.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.270
Yeah!
- That's right!

05:11.395 --> 05:13.897
How about we call <i>this</i>
the rational side of town

05:14.023 --> 05:15.899
and <i>that</i> the redneck side?!

05:17.151 --> 05:19.111
You just keep
all your flag burning

05:19.236 --> 05:22.364
and your hippie-rock protest
songs on your side of the town!

05:22.489 --> 05:23.741
Hey, wait a minute.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.826
Your side of town
has the post office.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.953
Well, your side
has the grocery store.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.205
You can come to our side of town
to use the post office

05:30.331 --> 05:32.541
if we can go to your side
to use the grocery store.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.336
Uh, can we cross the line
to take our kids to school?

05:35.461 --> 05:37.379
Well, naturally,
you can cross the line for that,

05:37.504 --> 05:40.132
just like we can cross the line
for hardware supplies, gas,

05:40.257 --> 05:41.342
and pharmaceutical needs.

05:41.467 --> 05:42.593
Yeah, okay.
- That's good.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.596
Hey, everybody,
this is never gonna work.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.889
Don't you see?

05:47.014 --> 05:50.100
All this dividin' up the town --
It's just ridiculous.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.061
What we really should be doing

05:52.186 --> 05:55.564
is just beating the hell
out of each other like we were.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.400
He's right.
Boy, do I feel like a fool.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.572
Cartman, what the hell
are you doing?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.574
You're supposed to be studying!
- That's what I'm doing.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.326
I'm about to find out
all about what happened

06:07.451 --> 06:09.161
back in 1776.
- How?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.205
All I have to do is be thinking
about American history

06:11.330 --> 06:12.373
when I walk through
this doorway.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.708
I'll trip the rope, causing
the rock to fall on my head,

06:14.833 --> 06:16.085
and then I will have a flashback

06:16.210 --> 06:17.669
to the times
of our founding fathers!

06:17.795 --> 06:20.047
Cartman, you are hereby declared
a full-fledged retard.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.757
Make fun of me all you want,
Kyle,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.008
but I will have the last laugh.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.843
Gentlemen, if you will clear
the doorway, please.

06:30.516 --> 06:34.728
Oh, gee, I wonder what it used
to be like in the year 1776.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.942
Derh.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.068
Derh...

06:41.193 --> 06:42.444
Cartman?

06:42.569 --> 06:43.737
Cartman!

06:44.571 --> 06:45.531
Benjamin Franklin?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.157
No, turd pants, it's Kyle!

06:47.282 --> 06:48.242
Kyle.

06:48.367 --> 06:52.913
Get out of my flashback,
you goddamn Jew.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.625
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

06:56.750 --> 06:59.711
Okay, people.
What are we rabbling about now?

06:59.837 --> 07:01.088
Mayor, our peace rally

07:01.213 --> 07:02.965
has always been set
for this Saturday.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.967
And now these pro-war bastards

07:05.092 --> 07:07.428
are suddenly trying to say
they get the town square.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.804
That's bull crap, Mayor!

07:08.929 --> 07:12.474
Our rally to support the war
was set up months ago.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.351
There was no <i>war</i> months ago!

07:14.476 --> 07:17.479
Hey, if you don't like America,
then you can get out!

07:17.604 --> 07:18.647
Look, nobody wants to hear

07:18.772 --> 07:21.692
a bunch of twangy-country-music,
pro-war propaganda.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.611
Nobody wants to hear a bunch
of rock protest songs!

07:24.736 --> 07:25.821
Yeah!
- Yeah!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.197
Up yours, rednecks!

07:27.322 --> 07:28.490
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

07:28.615 --> 07:31.785
Quiet, people!
The town square is public space.

07:31.910 --> 07:32.870
That means if neither group

07:32.995 --> 07:35.372
will nicely and maturely move
the day of its rally,

07:35.497 --> 07:38.208
I'll just have to give
the town square to both groups.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.501
All right!
That's fine!

07:39.626 --> 07:42.588
Because our war-support songs
will be a thousand times better!

07:42.713 --> 07:44.548
Oh, you think so?
Bring the shizzle.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.717
We'll trizzle the shizzle
all over the hizzle.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.302
Yeah?
See you Saturday,

07:53.140 --> 07:54.308

07:54.433 --> 07:56.643
You better be studying,
God damn it.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.896
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny.
You're just in time.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.314
Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

08:00.439 --> 08:01.607
I am just about to flash back

08:01.732 --> 08:03.025
to the days
of our founding fathers.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.443
Cartman, you're supposed
to be studying!

08:04.568 --> 08:05.444
What the hell is all this?

08:05.569 --> 08:07.279
I have programmed TiVo
to record over 50 hours

08:07.404 --> 08:08.280
of the History Channel.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.656
When TiVo is full,
both TiVo and I

08:09.781 --> 08:10.657
will be dropped into the water,

08:10.782 --> 08:11.950
combining our
electro-whatever fields

08:12.075 --> 08:13.702
and sending me into a flashback
of history.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.038
Uh, Cartman, I think
that's a really bad idea.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.247
Or a really sweet one.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.916
Your TiVo is full.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.542
Oh, here goes!

Cartman?

08:31.386 --> 08:32.763
Cartman?

08:32.888 --> 08:34.306
Aw, crap.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.689
Oh, awesome!

08:43.357 --> 08:45.108
Oi, there, young lad!
Are you all right?

08:45.234 --> 08:46.693
Yeah, yeah.
Can you tell me what year it is?

08:46.818 --> 08:49.279
This year?
Why, it's 1776, it is.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.782
Oh, yes!
I did it! I did it!

08:51.907 --> 08:53.158
Would you like a ride into town?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.035
I'm on my way to Master
Thomas Jefferson's house

08:55.160 --> 08:56.620
to get a very important
document, I am.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.123
Oh, kick fuckin' ass, dude!

09:00.249 --> 09:02.042
Never seen you around here,
friend.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.168
Might ye be from up north?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.462
No, I'm not from here at all.
I'm having a flashback.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.548
A flashback?
Why, what is that?

09:07.673 --> 09:10.008

Is he going to be all right,
Doctor?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.415
Your son tried to kill himself

09:41.540 --> 09:43.750
in a ritualistic fashion
I've never seen before.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.044
His chances of surviving
are very slim.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.838
I'm so sorry.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.881
Oh, baby.
Baby, you can't die!

09:50.007 --> 09:51.675
Yeah.
We have a report to do, asshole.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.843
Get up! Get up!

09:52.968 --> 09:55.095
Ooh. Easy, Kyle.
- But it's not fair!

09:55.220 --> 09:57.139
We have to do a full report
on the founding fathers,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.141
and -- and Cartman got out
of helping us again!

09:59.266 --> 10:01.018
I guess we're just gonna have to
do it with the three of us.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.936
Come on, guys.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.230
I know you're in
a very dark place now, sweetie,

10:05.355 --> 10:06.982
but you must come
toward the light.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.525
Come toward the light!

10:10.110 --> 10:11.278
Here we are, then --

10:11.403 --> 10:13.280
the current residence
of Master Thomas Jefferson.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.573
Super neato!

10:16.158 --> 10:17.492
I'm afraid
you'll have to wait here.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.077
But I need to talk
to the founding fathers

10:19.202 --> 10:20.078
to do my report.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.164
Sorry, only the official
messenger boy

10:22.289 --> 10:23.915
is allowed to talk
to Mr. Jefferson.

Oh, okay.

Hello.
I am Thomas Jefferson.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.979
And I am the official
messenger boy, I am!

10:46.104 --> 10:47.147
Very well.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.608
Take this document
to the Continental Congress.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.402
Wow. The Declaration
of Independence Day.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.446
Some favor going to war
with England,

10:54.571 --> 10:56.782
and others want to avoid war
at all costs.

10:56.907 --> 10:57.908
It's a bitch, ain't it?

10:58.033 --> 11:00.285
Perhaps this document
will make the reasons for war

11:00.410 --> 11:01.370
obvious to all.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.746
Good luck, young messenger.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.331
Now make haste!

11:06.291 --> 11:08.960
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote
the Declaration of Independence.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.337
Then the Continental Congress --

11:10.462 --> 11:12.172
No war! No war! No war!

11:12.297 --> 11:13.840
Oh, Jesus.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.842
Uh, boys, would you mind
clearing the living room?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.303
We have to practice
our big war-protest song.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.429
Dad, we have to study.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.056
Mr. Garrison is making us
do a presentation

11:21.181 --> 11:22.891
on what the founding fathers
would say about the war.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.519
Hey, that's a terrific idea!

11:25.644 --> 11:27.979
Yeah! We could have the boys
do their presentation

11:28.105 --> 11:29.940
as part of our peace rally
on Saturday!

11:30.065 --> 11:31.525
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.901
Support our troops!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.486
Support our troops!

11:34.611 --> 11:36.530
See?
I told you they had your son!

11:36.655 --> 11:38.198
Kenny, what are you doing
over here

11:38.323 --> 11:39.866
with all these
un-American traitors?

11:39.991 --> 11:41.243
Mrph rmhmhm rm.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.704
The boys are going to give
a presentation at <i>our</i> rally

11:43.829 --> 11:45.080
about how the founding fathers

11:45.205 --> 11:47.082
would agree with our right
to protest.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.500
What?! No!
- What?! Oh, no!

11:48.625 --> 11:50.210
Actually, we hadn't
really come to a --

11:50.335 --> 11:53.463
Look, my son is a patriot
and loves his country!

11:53.588 --> 11:54.923
- Come on, Kenny!
- Mrph rmh --

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
Now!
- Yeah!

11:56.508 --> 11:57.509
Support our troops!

11:57.634 --> 11:58.677
Support our troops!

11:58.802 --> 12:00.846
Oh, Kenny, n-- Oh! Aw.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.973
Aw, now we lost two
in our study group!

12:03.098 --> 12:04.141
God damn it!

12:04.266 --> 12:06.101
Can you believe
those hick sons of bitches?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.311
Manipulating their kids
into being on their side.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.646
Disgraceful!

12:09.771 --> 12:12.023
Stan and Kyle, it's up to you
to show all those warmongers

12:12.149 --> 12:13.859
that the founding fathers
agree with us!

12:13.984 --> 12:16.445
Yeah, that's right!
Let's get back to work!

12:16.570 --> 12:19.322
Do you think kids in every town
have to deal with this crap?

12:22.868 --> 12:26.163
Enter, young messenger!

12:32.377 --> 12:35.881
I am John Hancock,
president of the Congress.

12:36.006 --> 12:36.965
Wow!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.383
Mr. John Adams?

12:38.508 --> 12:39.384
Aye.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.594
Will you do the honors

12:40.719 --> 12:42.971
of reading the document
to Congress, please?

12:44.473 --> 12:46.433
"When in the course
of human events,

12:46.558 --> 12:48.810
it becomes necessary
for one people to..."

12:48.935 --> 12:51.021
"...we mutually pledge
to each other our lives,

12:51.146 --> 12:54.107
our fortunes,
and our sacred honor.

12:55.567 --> 12:59.988
P.S. every Thursday
should be 'free ice cream' day."

13:02.783 --> 13:05.702
Excuse me, but does this
declaration actually suggest

13:05.827 --> 13:07.996
that we should go to war
with England?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.998
We have no choice,
Mr. Dickinson.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.294
All right, everyone.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.798
Thank you all for coming out
to protest the war, m'kay!

13:19.549 --> 13:20.801
Don't kid yourselves.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.720
These people have come out
to support our troops, right?!

13:25.555 --> 13:28.600
And now Randy Marsh is
gonna sing a protest song

13:28.725 --> 13:30.185
he wrote about the war.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.561
Oh, no, you don't!

13:31.686 --> 13:33.939
We're doing
our pro-war song first!

13:34.064 --> 13:34.815
Yeah!

13:34.940 --> 13:35.982
The last thing these people want

13:36.107 --> 13:38.443
is another bleeding-heart
rock protest song!

13:38.568 --> 13:42.155
People, I told you,
you have to share the stage.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.116
Nobody wants to hear another
pro-war country song!

15:14.456 --> 15:15.540
If we found a country,

15:15.665 --> 15:17.959
it should be founded on peace
and diplomacy!

15:18.084 --> 15:21.046
England will only understand
one thing -- force.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.881
I must state again
for the record

15:23.006 --> 15:24.674
that South Carolina,
North Carolina,

15:24.799 --> 15:27.636
Pennsylvania, Maryland,
and Georgia are against war!

15:27.761 --> 15:30.221
Yeah, because you don't care
about the fate of the colonies

15:30.347 --> 15:31.306
like we do!

15:31.431 --> 15:32.807
You're all unpatriotic!

15:32.933 --> 15:36.353
And if you don't like the
colonies, then you can get out!

15:36.478 --> 15:38.063
Don't you call <i>us</i> unpatriotic!

15:38.188 --> 15:39.439
We are protesting this war

15:39.564 --> 15:41.983
because we care so <i>deeply</i>
for the fate of our colonies!

15:42.108 --> 15:44.235
You are all unpatriotic
for leading the colonies

15:44.361 --> 15:46.488
into a war that half of them
don't want!

15:49.240 --> 15:51.826
Whoa.
How very, very relevant.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.914
Tom, I'm standing
in the town square,

15:56.039 --> 15:57.624
where the war rally
has been going on

15:57.749 --> 16:00.043
for an incredible 87 hours.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.754
The crowd still appears to be
split right down the middle --

16:02.879 --> 16:05.507
half support country music and
the other half rock 'n' roll.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.675
Let's listen in.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.218
And now we'd like to bring out

16:08.343 --> 16:10.595
a couple of very special
South Park students

16:10.720 --> 16:13.056
who did a report
on what the founding fathers

16:13.181 --> 16:16.226
would have to say about the war.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.813
Boo!

16:19.938 --> 16:22.440
For you people who still think
war is the answer,

16:22.565 --> 16:26.152
perhaps you can listen
to the voices...of the children.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.993
Uh, we didn't do it.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.285
What?

16:34.411 --> 16:36.371
We didn't do our homework.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.415
Boys, you were supposed
to come out here

16:38.540 --> 16:40.750
and tell everyone
about the founding fathers!

16:40.875 --> 16:42.085
First we lost one study partner

16:42.210 --> 16:43.503
when Cartman put himself
in the hospital,

16:43.628 --> 16:44.504
and then they took Kenny away.

16:44.629 --> 16:45.922
Then Kyle forgot
to set his clock ahead

16:46.047 --> 16:47.549
for Daylight Savings,
and we couldn't find anything

16:47.674 --> 16:48.842
in the history books
about Iraq --

16:48.967 --> 16:50.552
That's because
the founding fathers

16:50.677 --> 16:52.095
would have supported the war!

16:52.220 --> 16:54.931
The founding fathers
would have protested, like us!

16:55.056 --> 16:56.141
Support!
- Support!

16:56.266 --> 16:57.308
Protest!
- Protest!

16:57.434 --> 16:58.435
Country!
- Country!

16:58.560 --> 17:00.603
Rock 'n' roll!
- Rock 'n' roll!

17:06.860 --> 17:08.153
Aah!

17:09.904 --> 17:11.781
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

17:11.906 --> 17:14.242
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

17:14.367 --> 17:16.536
We cannot found a country
based on war!

17:16.661 --> 17:19.039
We cannot found a country
that is afraid to fight!

17:19.164 --> 17:19.873
Rabble!

17:19.998 --> 17:22.000
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!

17:22.125 --> 17:24.085
Oh. Benjamin Franklin.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.837
Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin's here.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.589
It's Mr. Franklin.
- Franklin, Franklin.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.466
Oh, Benjamin Franklin.
Franklin, Franklin.

17:29.591 --> 17:30.633
Benjamin Franklin.

17:30.759 --> 17:34.345
Mr. Franklin, where do you stand
on the war issue?

17:34.929 --> 17:38.683
I believe that if we are to form
a new country,

17:38.808 --> 17:42.312
we cannot be a country that
appears war-hungry and violent

17:42.437 --> 17:43.980
to the rest of the world.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.316
However, we also cannot be
a country

17:46.441 --> 17:48.943
that appears weak
and unwilling to fight

17:49.069 --> 17:50.528
to the rest of the world.

17:50.653 --> 17:56.367
So, what if we form a country...
that appears to want both?

17:57.994 --> 18:00.330
Yes.
Yes, of course.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.831
We go to war...

18:01.956 --> 18:04.459
and protest going to war
at the same time!

18:04.584 --> 18:05.835
Right!

18:05.960 --> 18:07.003
If the people of our new country

18:07.128 --> 18:08.505
are allowed to do
whatever they wish,

18:08.630 --> 18:11.508
then some will support the war
and some will protest it.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.510
And that means that as a nation,

18:13.635 --> 18:16.012
we could go to war
with whomever we wished

18:16.137 --> 18:19.182
but at the same time
act like we didn't want to.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.476
If we allow the people
to protest

18:21.601 --> 18:22.769
what the government does,

18:22.894 --> 18:26.064
then the country will be
forever blameless.

18:26.189 --> 18:29.734
It's like having your cake
and eating it, too.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.238
Think of it -- an entire nation
founded on saying one thing

18:33.363 --> 18:34.322
and doing another.

18:34.447 --> 18:40.203
And we will call that country
the United States of America.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.204
Wow!

18:41.329 --> 18:42.580
I get it now!

18:42.705 --> 18:43.915
I get it!

18:44.040 --> 18:45.333
Whoa.
Here goes.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.001
I wish I could
go back to my time...

18:47.127 --> 18:49.504
to my time...
to -- to my time.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.340
Wow!

19:05.436 --> 19:07.480
Everyone, stop, please!

19:08.857 --> 19:10.191
The -- the child.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.818
The child from the hospital!

19:11.943 --> 19:15.405
If you all don't mind, I would
like to do my report now.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.699
I know what the founding fathers
would say.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.576
He does?
- He does?

19:19.701 --> 19:20.994
I learned something today.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.246
This country was founded
by some of the smartest thinkers

19:23.371 --> 19:25.790
the world has ever seen,
and they knew one thing --

19:25.915 --> 19:28.042
that a truly great country
can go to war

19:28.168 --> 19:31.045
and at the same time
act like it doesn't want to.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.756
You people who are for the war,
you need the protesters

19:33.882 --> 19:36.134
because they make the country
look like it's made of sane,

19:36.259 --> 19:37.260
caring individuals.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.721
And you people who are antiwar,
you need these flag-wavers,

19:39.846 --> 19:41.181
because if our whole country

19:41.306 --> 19:43.224
was made up of nothing
but soft, pussy protesters,

19:43.349 --> 19:45.018
we'd get taken down in a second.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.520
That's why the founding fathers
decided we should have both.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.398
It's called having your cake
and eating it, too.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.150
He's right.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.776
The strength of this country

19:53.902 --> 19:56.112
is the ability to do one thing
and say another.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.032
Yeah, if it weren't
for all you guys protesting,

19:59.157 --> 20:01.451
everyone around the world
would hate the American people

20:01.576 --> 20:03.203
instead of just the president.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.788
And if it weren't for you people
flexing your arms,

20:05.914 --> 20:08.208
America could easily
get taken over by terrorists

20:08.333 --> 20:09.417
or -- or China.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.836
I guess we owe you an apology.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.755
And I-I guess we owe <i>you</i> one.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.632
Aw.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.050
Aw.
- Aw.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.468
Aw.
- Aw.

20:18.593 --> 20:19.636
Aw.
- Aw.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.054
Cartman?

20:21.179 --> 20:23.306
Cartman saved the day?
- Can't be.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.058
The founding fathers
want you all to know

20:25.183 --> 20:26.601
that we can disagree
all we want,

20:26.726 --> 20:28.811
as long as we agree
that America kicks ass.
