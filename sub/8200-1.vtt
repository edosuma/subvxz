02:12.360 --> 02:13.873
My good brother.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.710
That"s it? No suitcase?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.152
Let"s just get out of here.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.912
Don"t smoke in the car.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.153
- Afternoon, Miss Graves. Welcome.
- Hello.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.069
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.958
- Shall I take your coat?
- No, thanks. L"m not staying.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.315
Brad, Dex, sorry I can"t stay for lunch.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.949
I have a board meeting in Detroit.
This won"t take long.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.237
Nothing for me.
No, maybe l"II have a Diet Coke.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.709
Make that Evian water, please.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.878
l"II have San Pellegrino water. No ice.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.430
Here"s the deal. There"s no deal.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.431
- My client balked.
- What do you mean?

03:18.520 --> 03:22.752
- She thinks her company"s worth more.
- She thinks or you think?

03:22.840 --> 03:25.752
On second thought, that looks interesting.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.719
- Just tell us what you want and don"t say...
- Smoked chicken?

03:31.600 --> 03:33.591
l"ve got to make a phone call.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.274
It"s just us here. What are you looking for?

03:36.600 --> 03:38.511
l"m looking for a world of fair play...

03:38.600 --> 03:41.592
...where corporate big guys
don"t always get their way.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.830
Still beating up on your ex-husband?

03:45.160 --> 03:46.957
You"re gonna pay for that one.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.871
Who"s her husband?

03:48.960 --> 03:50.473
Me and my big mouth.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.595
Pookie!

03:52.680 --> 03:53.908
Don"t call me Pookie.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.072
Sorry. I just meant to be affectionate.
What"s the matter?

03:57.160 --> 04:00.675
Nothing. I'm just in a meeting
and I don't have a lot of time.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.228
Remember when you said you wanted
to have sex with me in a weird place?

04:06.320 --> 04:07.719
How about Detroit?

04:07.840 --> 04:11.879
Too kinky. Anyway, they"re installing
my big screen on Sunday...

04:11.960 --> 04:15.077
...and I have the Mile High Mall
presentation in Denver next week.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.072
- What will I do by myself in Detroit?
- Buy a Chevy. Prove you"re American.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.911
I don"t love you, and I won"t miss you.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.752
Call me when you get there.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.273
"Bye.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.436
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Diggs.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.237
Go right in. Enjoy the party.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.549
Thank you very much.
It will be taken care of.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.993
It"s my pleasure.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.999
What happened, Boss?

05:27.080 --> 05:30.117
Did they go for it? They"re crazy not to.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.319
What do these Colombians want?
It"s foolproof!

05:33.800 --> 05:37.918
We got all the customs agents,
the border guards. Everything"s in place!

05:38.680 --> 05:41.433
We"ve got a little problem.
A cloud over us.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.795
The cartel"s made an offer of $50 million.

05:43.880 --> 05:49.113
It will be on the table for 30 days
if we can make this little problem go away.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.794
Jarmin. They know about Jarmin, right?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.836
It"s time to finish it.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.990
We"ve got to find him and take him out.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.911
Easier said than done.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.790
We"II do it ourselves this time.
Make sure it gets done right.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.069
Lovely day.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.390
But we have a little cloud to blow away.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.240
Closing down, Billy Ray.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.880
Nobody driving
in this bad weather tonight.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.559
Why don"t you give up on that tank,
come on over to the house for dinner?

06:41.480 --> 06:43.994
It"s no good you being alone so much.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.477
Been in town three months,
you haven"t made one friend.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.716
At least none that l"ve seen.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.631
Why don"t you wash up,
come and meet the missus tonight?

06:55.520 --> 06:56.589
Hear me?

06:58.880 --> 07:00.916
l"m gonna turn down this radio.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.075
You gone to sleep under there?

07:07.480 --> 07:09.755
God! Help me, Marvin!

07:09.840 --> 07:12.638
Help me! Pull me out!
Get me out of here!

07:13.120 --> 07:15.156
- Hold on!
- Help me.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.355
Get me out!

07:17.440 --> 07:18.509
Goddamn it!

07:18.600 --> 07:19.715
Get this off of me!

07:22.800 --> 07:24.791
What am I gonna do with no legs?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.199
Look at you!

07:31.480 --> 07:33.471
Something wrong with your brain?

07:35.480 --> 07:39.553
l"m sorry. I gotta do something
to break up the monotony around here.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.868
You"re bored?

07:41.560 --> 07:44.438
l"m bored as hell. Don"t take it personal.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.078
l"m just a restless guy.
That"s the kind of guy I am.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.799
That"s why I travel around so much.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.670
I get it from my daddy. He"s a traveling
salesman. Sold hairbrushes in Kentucky.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.838
Thought you said your dad raised hogs
in Tennessee.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.515
He raised hogs and he sold hairbrushes.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.636
You"II bullshit at the drop of a hat.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.349
You can"t say you never pulled
anybody"s leg before.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.511
l"II get it.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.873
Thank you for that dinner invitation.

08:23.880 --> 08:26.633
- May I help you, ma"am?
- Unleaded, please.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.831
- Hey, is that WJB on the radio?
- I have no idea.

08:36.919 --> 08:40.515
Yep, that"s what it is. That"s a "60s station.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.750
I listen to that one all day.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.559
You know what they say about the "60s,
don"t you?

08:45.640 --> 08:48.108
If you can remember them,
you wasn"t there.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.155
- Want me to check under the hood?
- No. It"s rented.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.198
You come to Detroit
and you rent a Beemer?

08:58.280 --> 09:02.398
That"s like going to Germany
and eating Jimmy Dean sausages.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.111
In Tennessee, where I was born,
I never saw cars like this.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.634
I was 22 before
I knew foreigners made cars.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.233
Are you from Tennessee?

09:12.320 --> 09:15.676
- Yes, ma"am, l"m a Southern boy.
- What"s your name?

09:15.760 --> 09:16.954
Billy Ray.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.999
Named after both the scoundrels my mama
thought might have been my daddy.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.750
Is that cash or card, ma"am?

09:29.440 --> 09:30.429
Rick?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.078
Beg your pardon?

09:35.280 --> 09:37.510
- Will MasterCard do?
- Just fine.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.112
- You remind me of someone a lot.
- I do?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.033
Yeah, a boy. A man.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.711
Named Rick Jarmin.
His plane went down in Mexico.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.038
Fifteen years ago.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.591
- I never went to Mexico, but...
- You laugh like him.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.672
- I didn"t mean to.
- You look like him.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.513
I don"t know what to tell you.
Want to sign that?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.632
You have a nice day.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.512
- Billy Ray?
- Ma"am?

10:22.680 --> 10:24.318
Do you have a tattoo?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.113
Tattoo? No.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.271
Your upper right arm. A dove.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.438
I don"t have a tattoo.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.515
l"m not leaving till you show me.

10:42.440 --> 10:46.115
I hope nobody"s looking. There. Satisfied?

10:47.160 --> 10:48.195
Right arm.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.478
I got some shrapnel in Vietnam.
It"s down my side. Want to see it?

10:59.560 --> 11:03.678
l"m sorry. My friend
would have never been in that war.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.829
Meaning what?

11:11.440 --> 11:13.476
He was very much against killing.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.871
I'd like to help you, sir,
but Offiicer Baird is retired.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.911
That"s not possible!
He wouldn"t retire without telling me.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.468
He"s been handling my case
for the last 15 years.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.473
Give me your current name and ID, and
l"II connect you with your new case officer.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.632
With all due respect,
I don't know who the hell you are.

11:36.720 --> 11:41.111
If I give you my name and number,
you"II know everything.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.073
- Hold, please.
- No, hang on. Damn it! Hello?

11:46.200 --> 11:47.428
Excuse me.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.313
That call you've been waiting for?
He's on the line.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.154
He won't give me his current name
or location. He wants Lou Baird.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.270
Rick? How you doing?

11:59.360 --> 12:03.399
This is Joe Weyburn. Remember me?
I set you up at that photo lab in Cleveland.

12:03.480 --> 12:06.790
Was it 1978? No, 1979.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.913
I don"t remember you.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.360
You know us FBI guys all look alike.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.159
You are one rolling stone, aren"t you?
Where are you now, Rick?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.754
Where"s Lou? He would have told me
he was retiring.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.037
- Why didn't he do that?
- To tell you the truth, he lost you.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.712
- He lost me?
- Yeah.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.110
That's why we put him out to pasture,
why I'm on the case.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.431
Where is he? Where did he retire to?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.916
Where did he retire to?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.673
He once gave me a number.
His sister"s place in St. Louis.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.150
He used to go there on vacations.
Is that where he is? Am I getting warm?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.558
He"s out of the picture.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.437
Are you in some kind of trouble?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.355
Not at all. Where"s Sorenson?

13:07.440 --> 13:10.238
Still safely in jail as far as I know.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.398
Nothing to worry about.
He"s never getting out!

13:15.480 --> 13:16.799
His partner?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.632
- Diggs?
- Yeah.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.671
Unless he"s made another pass at you...

13:23.760 --> 13:27.275
...he"s probably got his drug money
living the good life in South America.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.238
- We have no idea where he is.
- That"s a relief.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.709
So what is it...

13:32.800 --> 13:34.199
...relocation time?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.271
I guess. Where can you put me?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.233
Where are you now?
And what name are you using?

13:41.880 --> 13:44.872
Come on, I'm just trying to do my job.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.117
Bowers, Billy Ray.
I live above Marvin"s Motown Motors.

13:50.200 --> 13:54.034
1840 Canoga Street, Detroit.
Did you get that? I'm not repeating it.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.354
Somebody recognized me.
I want to get out before they come back.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.475
Right.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.589
Two days.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.954
Two days?

14:09.440 --> 14:13.831
Hang on and we"II have somebody
come in and get you.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.831
Okay, l"II be hanging.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.511
The drop in foreign sales...

14:58.680 --> 15:01.831
...reflects both the negative effect
of the strengthening dollar...

15:01.920 --> 15:05.515
...and an upsurge in competitive
production in Europe and Asia.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.115
Add this to the recent surcharge
imposed by the EEC nations...

15:09.200 --> 15:13.716
...it's clear that to preserve the profiit
our shareholders expect...

15:13.800 --> 15:17.110
...we have to make cuts
to our production costs.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.760
While it is true our rising costs...

15:19.840 --> 15:24.356
...will be defrayed by the acquisition of
Coleman Shipping, we should be clear...

15:57.720 --> 15:59.358
You"re freaking me out!

15:59.480 --> 16:01.232
All those opposed?

16:02.720 --> 16:05.473
If Miss Graves will respond?

16:06.760 --> 16:10.309
- Miss Graves!
- Yes.

16:13.000 --> 16:13.989
No.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.709
You are abstaining from the final vote?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.070
Yes. No, I am not.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.349
I see.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.835
She says to me, "'Marvin,
you"re not getting any younger.

16:34.320 --> 16:39.110
"'Think about that young man working
for you, and offer him a partnership."'

16:39.200 --> 16:42.795
- We don"t have no sons.
- You ain"t known me but three months.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.270
How do you know you can trust me
to stick around or not steal from you?

16:46.360 --> 16:48.032
I got my eyes on you.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.190
The hand is quicker than the eye.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.510
l"m going upstairs and get some sleep.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.751
See you in the morning.
Think about that partnership.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.117
- L"II see you in the morning.
- That mean it"s a deal?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.472
I sure will think about it.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.874
Good night.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.353
Pumps are closed.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.949
Pumps are closed.
She won"t be humming again till 6:30 a.m.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.799
You Billy Ray Bowers?

18:31.200 --> 18:33.156
Y"all from Weyburn"s office?

18:34.040 --> 18:35.996
Y"all got an interesting accent.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.829
Shit.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.434
You always were an actor,
weren"t you, Rick?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.879
- You pretended to be my friend.
- I never did.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.554
- Then you turned on me.
- I never agreed to help you kill.

18:46.640 --> 18:51.191
Still a do-gooder?
My friend, Mr. Diggs, is worried about that.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.956
l"ve served my time, thanks to you,
but he"s still under indictment.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.589
Seeing as you"re the only living witness
that can put him behind bars...

19:00.680 --> 19:02.750
What"s he got on you? You still his flunky?

19:02.840 --> 19:07.197
Are you some hero?
Hiding in a grease pit for 15 years?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.716
I don"t think they"II put up
any monuments for you.

19:11.640 --> 19:12.834
Any last words?

19:21.640 --> 19:22.993
What"s going on?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.992
Get out of here! Run for your damn life!

19:27.120 --> 19:28.155
Watch out!

20:17.360 --> 20:18.349
Help!

20:32.960 --> 20:34.791
- Let me in!
- Rick, is that you?

20:34.880 --> 20:36.598
Yeah, it"s me! Let me in!

20:38.200 --> 20:41.829
- How do I know it"s you?
- It"s me, Muffy. Open the damn door!

20:47.680 --> 20:51.195
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Me? What the hell are you doing here?

20:51.280 --> 20:52.998
Being shot in the butt.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.994
- She saw you.
- I saw her, too.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.070
I appreciate this.
l"II have to borrow your phone if it"s okay.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.355
Ice. I need plenty of ice.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.671
l"II get the ice. You go to the room.
It"s the presidential suite.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.752
- Okay if I use your phone?
- L"II be there in a minute.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.155
- Miss Graves?
- Mr. Takawaki!

21:40.920 --> 21:42.911
Do little party?

21:44.680 --> 21:47.274
Yes. A party for girls.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.789
Maybe next time?

21:49.880 --> 21:51.279
Maybe.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.518
I don"t care if they"ve left for the day.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.512
l"ve got to get through to them.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.272
313...

22:05.360 --> 22:09.831
...555-7000.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.275
Yes. The presidential suite.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.239
Operator? God!

22:16.400 --> 22:18.277
- Rick?
- What?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.192
Are you all right?

22:20.800 --> 22:23.030
l"ve been shot in the butt.
Can you believe it?

22:23.120 --> 22:26.430
- Can I come in?
- L"m naked. Can you handle it?

22:26.520 --> 22:29.956
I handled it for a lot of years.
I guess I can handle it now.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.037
It"s my lower back and my butt.
I think the pellet passed through...

22:37.120 --> 22:38.269
Vietnam?

22:39.360 --> 22:42.352
Hell, no. I took the dove off with a sander.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.468
I really am anxious to hear this story.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.793
I need some bandages,
antibiotic and some antiseptic.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.359
Get shot often?

22:51.440 --> 22:53.715
Only twice before.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.314
Could you please help me?
Could you look at my butt?

22:56.400 --> 22:58.152
You leave me at the altar.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.833
That was my state of mind at the time.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.718
You went off with Jamie
to seek your fortune...

23:05.800 --> 23:08.155
...and you were coming back to marry me.

23:08.240 --> 23:12.153
Am I remembering this correctly?
If not, correct me.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.512
You get lost in your plane.
Reported missing, presumed dead.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.479
I attend your memorial service,
and cried the tears of a grieving widow.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.677
I vow l"II never get over you.
In fact, I never do.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.958
I still carry your damn pictures
in my wallet!

23:30.200 --> 23:34.034
Until one day, I pull into a gas station...

23:34.240 --> 23:38.074
...and you"re alive with people chasing you
and you ask me to look at your butt?

23:38.160 --> 23:42.073
That"s kind of neat.
Rick"s alive and he"s shot in the butt.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.358
Guess who"s alive and shot in the butt?
Rick! L"m looking at his butt now!

23:46.440 --> 23:48.795
You lying...

23:48.880 --> 23:50.438
...gutless...

23:50.520 --> 23:52.795
...son of a...

23:53.520 --> 23:56.717
...yellow snodbugger, toad, bellybutton...

23:56.800 --> 24:00.759
I can"t think of enough awful things
to say about you, you bastard!

24:02.640 --> 24:05.074
I guess that"s a no on examining my butt.

24:05.640 --> 24:09.110
- L"II get it. It"s probably for me.
- You can"t answer my phone.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.075
Hello?

24:11.360 --> 24:14.352
Yes. Fine. Taking a shower.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.480
l"m coming home tomorrow.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.879
Okay. "Bye.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.589
Same guy?

24:25.680 --> 24:28.717
- What guy?
- Harper. Jeremy III.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.075
Rich boy, redneck asshole.
The one you married.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.674
- You remember him?
- You know I got married?

24:33.760 --> 24:36.035
Yeah. Four months after I disappeared.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.152
That"s pretty quick work
for a grieving widow.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.793
Where were you?

24:41.880 --> 24:44.678
- You could have waited to find out.
- I was Ionely.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.639
You were Ionely
so you married the joke of the campus!

24:48.920 --> 24:51.957
Jerry the Napalm King.
How could you do that?

24:52.040 --> 24:55.237
We had it wrong.
His family made laundry detergent.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.710
- Cornwall Chemicals?
- No. Kitchen cleanser.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.795
Don"t kid yourself.
They were getting rich off the war.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.190
The war? Was that it?
You were dodging the draft?

25:06.680 --> 25:09.638
Or were you too gutless to tell me
you didn"t want to marry me?

25:15.400 --> 25:16.799
Are you all right?

25:17.360 --> 25:19.555
Yeah. I just feel a little woozy.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.394
- I better call the doctor.
- No doctors.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.272
Four Seasons Hotel.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.874
Is this the front desk?
Is there a pharmacy?

25:27.120 --> 25:28.269
Yes, certainly.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.750
Please send up gauze pads,
tape and hydrogen peroxide.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.149
- Right away, Miss Graves.
- Thank you.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.670
All right. What"s going on?

25:39.160 --> 25:41.674
Was that a holdup
or is someone chasing you?

25:47.720 --> 25:49.119
Got any kids?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.309
It"s just you"ve got that "'Mom"' tone.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.829
l"m a lawyer. I have that lawyer tone.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.199
I can help you.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.273
Will you talk to me?

26:07.080 --> 26:08.115
Tomorrow.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.077
l"II talk to you tomorrow.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.274
Good Lord.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.670
Rick Jarmin"s alive.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.759
- How"s it going?
- Any idea who did this?

26:47.840 --> 26:51.594
Maybe. I got a phone tip from
an eyewitness, said there was shooting...

26:51.680 --> 26:54.433
...and a blue Beemer racing away
with a man and woman in it.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.751
- We"II see what happens.
- Sarge, better take a look at this.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.034
See you later.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.709
Here.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.788
Thanks a lot.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.472
I have a right to be rude.
I left a message for him.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.198
I waited for it and...

27:19.200 --> 27:21.316
He picked it up. What time was that?

27:25.560 --> 27:27.949
I want to go above his head.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.833
Try it by name. Try Bowers.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.560
- Billy Ray Bowers.
- No one by that name on our list.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.108
- No record of a Billy Ray Bowers?
- No, sir.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.189
- Try Jean-Pierre Fouret.
- No, sir.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.596
- Turnbull, Jodie.
- No.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.429
- Carlson, Matthew.
- No, sir.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.231
Try Jarmin, Richard.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.153
Rick Jarmin.
See if anybody by that name exists.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.995
l"m sorry, sir. Have a nice day.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.277
Something"s gone wrong.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.716
I don"t seem to exist anymore.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.349
Expecting someone?

28:21.440 --> 28:24.238
I have a standing order for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.596
- What time is it?
- 6:48.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.275
You got a gun?
Of course you don"t have a gun.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.828
- You got any kind of weapon?
- No. It"s my breakfast.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.435
Marianne, get dressed.
Get dressed fast, please.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.872
Yeah, we can make it.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.872
What do you mean "'we"'?
l"m not going out there!

28:44.280 --> 28:46.396
Four attempts have been made on my life.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.789
If you open that door,
you could end up dead.

28:48.880 --> 28:52.395
Listen to me. We are at the top
of a veritable fortress.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.278
Yes! Presidents, oil sheiks stay here.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.477
Friends of Lee lacocca stay here.
George Harrison stays here.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.030
Yes! Because it has the best security
money can buy. Don"t be paranoid.

29:02.120 --> 29:05.157
I hate to be an old woman,
but paranoid keeps me alive.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.515
This guy comes every morning. Trust me.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.717
- Got your breakfast, Miss Graves.
- What did you order?

29:10.800 --> 29:13.519
- What did you order?
- I ordered...

29:13.600 --> 29:15.477
...grapefruit, croissant...

29:17.400 --> 29:18.389
And what?

29:19.960 --> 29:21.029
Prunes.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.638
Ask him what he"s got.

29:24.960 --> 29:28.396
- Go on, ask him. Bet he can"t tell you.
- What"s for breakfast?

29:28.920 --> 29:31.559
Some kind of breads and fruits.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.273
l"II be right there.
Rick, pull up a chair, sit down.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.955
l"II share my prunes
and then you can tell me all about this.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.389
Don"t take the chain off the door.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.836
Rattle it like you"II take it off.
Make him think you"II take it off.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.037
You mean like this? Is that good?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.951
Yeah. It"s funny to you.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.399
Oh, God!

29:57.960 --> 30:00.520
- Get the mace!
- You get it!

30:02.160 --> 30:04.037
The mace! The mace!

30:14.000 --> 30:15.149
Hurry up!

30:32.440 --> 30:35.352
- Come on! Upstairs!
- Wait a minute! Get my purse.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.630
- Hurry up!
- I can"t do this, Rick.

30:41.960 --> 30:45.157
What are you talking about?
This is what Lee lacocca does.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.591
l"m very scared, Rick.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.554
Since when did you start
wearing underpants?

30:54.640 --> 30:58.110
Do I get to know what"s going on
or do I get killed for old time"s sake?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.428
Follow me.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.834
- L"ve got to know what"s going on.
- So do I.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.393
l"m supposedly being protected
by the federal government...

31:06.480 --> 31:08.550
...but I think they"re trying to do me in.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.518
- Who are those men?
- Ex drug-enforcement agents.

31:12.600 --> 31:16.718
I sent one to jail and could send the other.
They want me and whoever"s with me.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.712
- Why?
- I testified against them. That"s why.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.030
- About what?
- It"s a long story.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.597
This is not a good time to talk about this.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.514
Help!

31:43.160 --> 31:44.354
My God!

31:57.680 --> 32:00.069
Is that the VIP entrance?

32:00.160 --> 32:02.435
Good morning. How are we doing today?

32:04.800 --> 32:08.713
l"m so hungry!
We got to get out of this room.

32:08.800 --> 32:12.349
- It"s too dangerous to go to the room.
- L"ve gotta change my clothes.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.670
No! We"II buy some, okay?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.990
If this isn"t a dream, l"m in deep shit.

32:21.560 --> 32:25.633
- You owe me an explanation.
- Get me out, l"II tell you everything.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.391
No. Don"t tell me.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.913
No keys.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.989
Gotcha!

32:39.840 --> 32:43.196
- I ought to weenie-whip you!
- Get that weenie out of my face!

32:43.280 --> 32:44.474
Let"s get outta here.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.035
- How you doing over there?
- Great.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.239
Tell me the story.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.997
Remember when Jamie and I
got everybody to chip in...

33:05.080 --> 33:09.790
...so we could go south
and score some real Acapulco gold?

33:09.880 --> 33:13.316
I remember you borrowed his father"s
plane so you could fly to Mexicali.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.231
That"s the last I ever heard from you.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.118
It seemed simple.
Fly south, pick up a couple of keys.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.760
But no, we were really impressed
with ourselves.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.195
We started drinking,
shooting off at the mouth...

33:23.280 --> 33:26.829
...and before we knew it there was this guy
called Sorenson involved.

33:26.920 --> 33:30.799
- Things just got a whole lot bigger.
- What a dumb-ass thing to do.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.757
- You always did love being a big shot.
- You don"t understand.

33:35.840 --> 33:40.550
I understand. You were being
a couple of jerks like always.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.598
Anything for a kick.
Anything to thumb your nose at authority.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.908
Your gold card.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.197
Where do you get off with that attitude?
"'Rick Jarmin, asshole."'

33:48.280 --> 33:50.669
- Whatever happened to you?
- I got smart.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.554
Is that what you call being corrupted?
"'Smart?"'

33:55.600 --> 33:58.831
- You know nothing about me.
- I got your number, baby.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.871
We got a blue Beemer.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.998
You"re totally unchanged. L"ve never met
anybody more holier-than-thou.

34:20.080 --> 34:23.914
Tell me something honestly.
Do you ever donate anything to the poor?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.072
Or do you and Jerry the Napalm King
hoard your millions?

34:27.159 --> 34:29.230
- Laundry detergent!
- Yeah, we had it wrong.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.072
Yes. We"re very rich
and we hoard our millions.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.958
Occasionally we invite a poor person in
for Thanksgiving.

34:35.040 --> 34:39.033
Feed him nothing. We eat turkey
in front of him and watch him starve.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.674
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- Yeah. Wisconsin.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.672
- Wisconsin?
- Yeah. Racine, Wisconsin.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.719
l"ve got to find Lou Baird. He"s the one
I can trust to get me back into hiding.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.839
- What"s he doing in Wisconsin?
- He"s not. He"s in St. Louis.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.629
l"m with Rick Jarmin again.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.358
My address book is in Wisconsin.

34:58.440 --> 35:01.079
His sister is there,
and I think that"s where he retired.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.674
I don"t think you"re
in any witness-relocation program.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.320
You"re some two-bit criminal
being chased by the police.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.438
- You don"t mean that.
- Or you can"t pay your gambling debts.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.672
- You dressed it up with this FBI crap.
- Wisconsin is only six hours away.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.355
- I have a life.
- But are you happy?

35:16.440 --> 35:19.989
- L"m expected home.
- Hands on the dashboard. Don"t move.

35:20.960 --> 35:25.431
- Get that gun out of my face.
- You have the right to an attorney.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.397
I am an attorney, damn it!

35:27.480 --> 35:29.869
- Are you Billy Ray Bowers?
- What"s he charged with?

35:29.960 --> 35:32.599
You"re both charged
with the killing of Marvin Marsent.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.716
You were identified
at the scene of the crime.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.597
Rick, tell them.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.560
- What?
- About the witness relocation program.

35:39.640 --> 35:44.316
- You"II have time to tell us in jail.
- Put both hands behind your head.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.639
Drive!

35:54.800 --> 35:55.994
Get in the car!

35:58.440 --> 36:00.556
Shut up and steer the damn thing!

36:00.760 --> 36:03.399
- Did you kill the guy?
- No, I loved him. They killed him.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.311
Then you can plead innocent!

36:05.400 --> 36:09.154
I never will. They"II kill me before
I get a chance. The same goes for you.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.759
Get your foot off!

36:34.600 --> 36:36.238
Shit! Oh, God!

36:44.440 --> 36:46.431
You"re gonna break my legs!

36:48.160 --> 36:49.479
Stop squealing!

36:59.840 --> 37:03.549
Watch where you"re going.
Go north as soon as you can.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.876
Get your face off my gas!

37:08.600 --> 37:09.669
Shit!

37:11.280 --> 37:13.157
This can"t be good for you.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.956
- What are you doing?
- L"m taking your place. Move over.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.352
This is a rented car.
We can get in trouble if you drive it.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.557
- You"re worried about Hertz? Move!
- Give me my wheel!

37:25.640 --> 37:28.712
You"II get us both killed.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.634
Move over!

37:39.560 --> 37:40.549
Jesus!

37:50.880 --> 37:52.836
- I think we lost them.
- Where are we?

37:52.920 --> 37:54.114
They"re not there anymore.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.158
- We"re in the railway tunnel.
- Where the hell are we?

37:59.800 --> 38:00.789
Shit!

38:13.800 --> 38:14.676
Back up!

38:28.960 --> 38:30.439
I don"t know. Stuck.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.709
Goddamn!

38:58.000 --> 39:00.560
What are you doing?
You almost got us killed!

39:00.880 --> 39:02.393
I did you a favor.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.116
Are you having fun or something?

39:06.000 --> 39:09.390
I can"t believe when you pulled...

39:09.480 --> 39:11.516
You were great back there.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.438
I was so scared!

39:14.600 --> 39:17.512
You"II love it in Racine.
It"s a happening town.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.549
The car was rented by Marianne Graves,
a lawyer from New York.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.957
How she got involved, I don"t know,
but I don"t like it.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.439
Call it kidnapping.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.512
He"II kill her the same way
he killed his boss at the gas station.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.194
I don't like all this killing.
Erasing a witness...

39:32.280 --> 39:35.033
You"re not trying to back out on us,
are you?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.833
Not a good idea, Joe.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.799
Please don"t smoke.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.438
We would hate to inform authorities
that 20 years ago you were responsible...

39:44.520 --> 39:48.308
...for selling confiscated narcotics out
of the back door of the police warehouse.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.188
Yeah, Joe. Especially now
that you"ve got yourself such a big career.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.230
Relax.

39:53.320 --> 39:57.472
l"m doing everything I can. L"ve used
the kidnapping to bring the FBI in.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.916
We"re plugged into the woman"s
phone lines, credit cards, bank account.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.070
Auto club. They're bound to surface.

40:03.160 --> 40:07.472
When they do, Jarmin will either be shot
or wind up in prison. Then he"s yours.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.676
We"re looking forward to that, Joe.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.189
What a pro.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.876
Hundreds! That"s all you carry.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.998
Where are we now?

41:50.240 --> 41:51.468
Shortcut.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.193
What"s the matter?

42:00.480 --> 42:01.595
Nothing.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.994
I never told you, Jamie"s dead.

42:11.080 --> 42:12.069
God!

42:12.560 --> 42:14.755
He was killed by Sorenson and Diggs.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.999
They were two drug enforcement agents,
corrupt ones.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.872
They busted Jamie and me
for the nickel bags we bought...

42:23.960 --> 42:27.919
...and told us we'd rot injail
if we didn't do exactly what they said.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.672
One minute we were kids...

42:29.760 --> 42:33.036
...and the next we were trapped
in the middle of a major drug deal.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.792
They needed our plane.

42:36.280 --> 42:40.034
They made us fly under the radar
to an unmarked airstrip on the US side...

42:40.120 --> 42:42.554
...and that's where all hell broke loose.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.952
Diggs and Sorenson must've been
under government surveillance...

42:46.040 --> 42:49.350
...'cause there were a lot of cops
waiting for us when we landed.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.070
Sorenson came out shooting.
He killed one of the border patrol guys.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.991
He wounded another one.

42:55.680 --> 42:57.477
Diggs, however, got away.

42:57.760 --> 43:00.354
Me and Jamie fiigured
we could bring Sorenson down...

43:00.440 --> 43:02.795
...before he killed anybody else.

43:02.880 --> 43:06.395
We were wrong.
Jamie got it point blank in the chest.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.790
I spent three months in a Mexicali jail...

43:17.880 --> 43:20.519
...before the FBI
fiinally offered me immunity...

43:20.600 --> 43:24.752
...for testifying against
Diggs and Sorenson.

43:26.640 --> 43:30.030
That"s when I joined
the Witness Relocation Program.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.230
It"s been fun ever since.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.918
Why didn"t you call me?

43:39.040 --> 43:41.349
I didn"t want to get you involved.

43:42.240 --> 43:46.028
You were about to march up
to the altar anyway, so I let it lie.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.276
This is it?

44:03.360 --> 44:06.318
I think this is it. It"s all changed around.

44:06.400 --> 44:10.916
Yeah, this is it.
It better be here or l"m in deep shit.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.070
l"m going to look for a bathroom.

44:13.240 --> 44:16.630
Have any change
so I can get to the VA hospital?

44:16.920 --> 44:17.989
Hold up.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.400
- Be right with you, pal.
- What do you need?

44:22.480 --> 44:24.710
- What"ve you got?
- What are you doing?

44:25.040 --> 44:26.712
That"s all you"ve got.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.358
Here, brother.

44:28.440 --> 44:31.034
- Have three squares on me.
- This all you"ve got?

44:31.120 --> 44:33.998
- How dare you do a thing like that!
- The guy"s hungry.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.753
That"s for me to decide! That"s my money!

44:36.840 --> 44:40.549
- You"ve got plenty. What"s the problem?
- I worked hard for it, damn it!

44:40.640 --> 44:44.030
You couldn"t carry something smaller?
Why do you carry hundreds? Status?

44:44.120 --> 44:45.951
No! Emergency.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.600
- This was an emergency.
- But it wasn"t my emergency.

44:48.680 --> 44:52.150
It"s that attitude that keeps half the people
in this world starving.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.231
I don"t see you feeding the poor!

44:54.320 --> 44:55.878
What did you just see?

44:55.960 --> 44:57.996
You"re such a jackass!

44:58.080 --> 44:59.229
Am I?

44:59.600 --> 45:01.272
Mattie?

45:01.360 --> 45:04.238
Mattie Carlson? My God!

45:05.280 --> 45:07.635
- Mattie?
- L"ve got to talk to you.

45:10.640 --> 45:13.950
When I left my job here,
I owed this guy a lot of money.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.075
Hi.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.830
You won"t believe who"s here!
It"s Mad Mattie Carlson!

45:19.560 --> 45:22.313
- Can you wait in the car? Could get ugly.
- Don"t tell me.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.549
I must talk to you.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.312
You were a hairdresser?

45:30.280 --> 45:33.238
You don"t get a lot of choice
in the relocation game.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.595
I can"t believe it!

45:39.440 --> 45:43.672
Raun is gonna shit! He"s gonna die!
I can"t believe it!

45:46.520 --> 45:50.229
Can"t say hi to an old friend?
Cat got your tongue?

45:50.920 --> 45:52.353
Say something!

45:53.640 --> 45:54.709
Hi, Scotty.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.994
Hiya, babe.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.232
I can"t believe you came back!

46:04.320 --> 46:05.878
- How are you?
- Great.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.709
I like the...

46:07.800 --> 46:10.633
That? It"s just dirty. I had to tie it up.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.438
- Gorgeous.
- Who"s this?

46:12.520 --> 46:13.953
This is my sister.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.871
Hi. Come on. Let"s go see Raun.

46:15.960 --> 46:18.349
- He"s dying to see you!
- L"II bet he is.

46:18.440 --> 46:22.319
Your brother is a genius! Michelangelo
of hair. L"m not exaggerating!

46:22.400 --> 46:24.391
We lost half our clientele when he left.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.199
He left on his lunch break.
Can you believe it?

46:27.280 --> 46:29.111
Bread and butter!

46:29.600 --> 46:31.750
- Silly girl.
- He always does my hair.

46:32.040 --> 46:35.316
Are you coming back?
You"II have to pay Raun what you owe him.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.470
- Raun, look who"s back.
- Hi, Raun.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.119
Hello, Matthew.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.795
l"II bet you"re surprised to see me.

46:44.080 --> 46:46.833
You"ve lost weight. Your hair!
You look 10 years younger!

46:46.920 --> 46:49.275
Cut the crap. You"ve been a bad boy.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.351
I know. Mea culpa.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.112
And sic semper tyrannis.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.158
You"re so right. But l"ve come
to pay you back what I owe you.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.356
Will wonders never cease?

46:58.680 --> 47:02.992
- You still have my things, my address...
- Show me cash, l"II show you the book.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.352
Could you hang on a minute?

47:06.320 --> 47:08.276
- This is funny to you?
- Yes.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.873
I need $2,000 cash.

47:10.960 --> 47:13.997
Isn"t it nice one of us
became a materialistic being?

47:14.280 --> 47:17.238
- Can you help me, please?
- What"s in it for me?

47:17.920 --> 47:22.311
If I get the book, I can get to Lou Baird
and pay you back quicker.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.914
If I don"t get the book,
you might be stuck with me.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.274
How"s that?

47:28.600 --> 47:30.431
Who do I make the check out to?

47:30.520 --> 47:33.876
l"m supposed to believe
your check is good? I want cash!

47:33.960 --> 47:36.030
- The bank"s over there.
- L"II get the book?

47:36.120 --> 47:40.398
We"II discuss it when I see cash.
And then l"II want an apology.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.755
Then you can do my hair.

47:42.840 --> 47:46.389
- Why mess with pertection?
- Rick, it"s only fair!

47:46.640 --> 47:48.631
- Who is this?
- His sister.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.396
- She called him Rick.
- I called him sick.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.118
He is sick!

47:54.200 --> 47:57.636
Cash. Apology. Hair.

47:57.720 --> 48:00.075
In that order. L"II be waiting.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.357
Driver"s license and three IDs.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.396
Credit cards do?

48:08.880 --> 48:09.756
Break.

48:18.680 --> 48:19.829
Where"d he go?

48:19.920 --> 48:22.150
- Stall them.
- L"m not stalling them.

48:24.840 --> 48:25.636
Sir?

48:25.720 --> 48:28.518
- What"s going on? Can you step on it?
- Certainly.

48:28.760 --> 48:29.590
Right.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.591
Take what you want.

48:31.680 --> 48:34.433
- What are you doing?
- L"m going as fast as I can.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.230
- Here.
- You"ve got the wrong idea.

48:37.520 --> 48:38.669
Freeze!

48:40.280 --> 48:41.349
Don"t move!

48:43.520 --> 48:44.873
Put your arms up.

48:47.560 --> 48:49.039
Down on the floor!

48:50.240 --> 48:52.993
- My credit cards!
- Forget about the credit cards!

48:54.800 --> 48:58.509
Just let me get my gold card.
Please? Just let me...

48:58.600 --> 49:00.272
Stay down or the girl gets it!

49:02.320 --> 49:03.833
- My purse!
- Come here!

49:16.440 --> 49:19.273
- What"s going on?
- Step across the street, please.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.713
Sure.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.958
l"m not going with you!

49:31.640 --> 49:35.155
You"ve got no choice. They"re after you,
too, and it"s not just the cops.

49:35.240 --> 49:38.357
What am I supposed to do?
Spend my life running like you?

49:38.440 --> 49:40.078
Well, it"s up to you.

49:40.360 --> 49:44.638
We"re dead if they catch us.
Now hop aboard or say good-bye.

49:46.880 --> 49:47.869
Come on.

49:52.920 --> 49:54.399
So long, tough guy.

49:55.640 --> 49:56.789
So long.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.153
What are you doing?

50:17.880 --> 50:19.677
This is the car. Lieberman?

50:19.880 --> 50:22.519
Cover the rear. Take McCurrin with you.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.633
Check out everything.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.233
Yes, sir, I got it.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.515
- Cover all the stores.
- Right.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.315
- Get this towed out of here.
- Yes, sir.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.919
Cover all the stores.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.272
What the hell am I doing?

50:45.960 --> 50:46.995
Hop on!

50:47.280 --> 50:49.589
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.036
- You okay?
- Why are we going back?

50:54.120 --> 50:55.519
I forgot something.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.519
Raun wants to play!

51:15.840 --> 51:20.311
- What is this? Butch on wheels?
- Here"s your cash. Give me the book.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.436
It"s more than you need.
Give me the book!

51:22.520 --> 51:23.748
Take me with you!

51:23.840 --> 51:26.593
- This town needs you.
- Cut the crap. Let"s get out of here.

51:26.680 --> 51:29.399
That ought to be enough
to cover the damages.

51:29.480 --> 51:30.833
What damages?

51:49.120 --> 51:49.950
Shit.

51:51.600 --> 51:52.396
Hang on.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.555
Look out!

51:58.520 --> 52:01.239
I have the suspect in sight
and I am in pursuit.

52:05.640 --> 52:06.675
Hang on.

52:07.920 --> 52:09.353
Get out of the way!

52:12.080 --> 52:15.550
I'm following suspect. I am in pursuit.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.714
Watch out!

52:31.840 --> 52:34.229
I almost have them. I am in pursuit.

52:50.160 --> 52:52.549
What are you doing
with your face in my sidewalk?

52:52.640 --> 52:54.312
I am no longer in pursuit.

53:11.960 --> 53:14.633
- Can you step on it? I'm in a hurry.
- I'm going as quickly as I can!

53:14.720 --> 53:18.156
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!
Don't move. Put your hands up.

53:18.520 --> 53:19.999
On the floor now!

53:21.600 --> 53:24.990
Looks like she"s there of her own free will.
Look at this part.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.593
Will you come here?

53:27.480 --> 53:30.517
She tried to go back for the money
when her boyfriend wanted out.

53:30.600 --> 53:34.275
He"s not her boyfriend. Can we
get that straight? I am her boyfriend.

53:34.360 --> 53:39.150
She"s not a kidnap victim, so the FBI
is out of it. It"s up to local authorities.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.959
Hi, Joe. This is Paul Bernhardt.
Joe Weyburn. He works here.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.230
Any theories as to how to head them off?

53:48.200 --> 53:50.509
He obviously used to work at this mall.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.436
Maybe going back to a place
of employment is a pattern.

53:54.920 --> 53:58.913
Without a record of previous employment,
we can only wait and see.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.594
Keep on it.

54:00.880 --> 54:02.199
Mr. Bernhardt.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.554
"'Matthew Carlson, Raun"s of Racine."'

54:28.560 --> 54:30.835
"'Jodie Turnbull, Muncie Farms."'

54:35.280 --> 54:36.349
Yeah!

54:36.640 --> 54:39.313
Tell him Rick Jarmin
needs to speak to him.

54:39.400 --> 54:41.470
I need to. It"s urgent, okay?

54:41.560 --> 54:44.597
Jarmin. J-A-R-M-l-N.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.152
Not till when?

54:47.640 --> 54:50.154
6:00 p.m.? On the dot, ma"am.

54:51.520 --> 54:53.033
Okay, thanks for...

54:53.320 --> 54:55.390
Yeah. He"II remember me.

54:55.880 --> 54:58.348
Believe me, he"II remember me.
Thanks again.

54:58.520 --> 54:59.635
"Bye, ma"am.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.035
Hallelujah!

55:02.720 --> 55:05.518
He"s there. Not till 6:00, but he"s there.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.989
He had to go to the doctor. Demon out!

55:09.080 --> 55:11.548
He"s got a job in the zoo.
He got me a job there once.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.956
Did I tell you about
when I worked at the zoo...

55:14.040 --> 55:17.555
I don"t wish to hear about the zoo.
I wish to get out of these bushes.

55:17.640 --> 55:22.031
l"m wearing cashmere in 100º heat.
I don"t feel like waiting till 6:00.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.917
- Well...
- Yeah?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.355
I know someplace we can go.
It"s on the way.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.874
If you don"t mind riding for a couple hours.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.791
- Think you can do that?
- Yeah.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.232
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.118
Either say it or don"t say it, all right?

56:15.760 --> 56:16.988
Rise and shine.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.710
- I need a night"s sleep.
- Ace!

56:24.000 --> 56:25.115
Come here.

56:27.280 --> 56:29.396
You son of a bitch. You"re still alive.

56:29.480 --> 56:32.711
Hopefully she"II get better
when she"s had the operation.

56:33.960 --> 56:34.949
Jodie?

56:36.720 --> 56:38.358
Rach. How are ya?

56:38.440 --> 56:41.796
- I never thought l"d see you again.
- I guess you"re surprised to see me.

56:41.880 --> 56:44.348
- You look great.
- Talk about dropping out of the blue.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.749
This guy built half this place
and disappeared.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.990
l"m sorry, this is Marianne Graves.

56:49.080 --> 56:51.548
- This is Dr. Rachel Varney.
- Hello.

56:52.760 --> 56:54.876
- You used to work here?
- Yeah.

56:54.960 --> 56:56.757
I was a carpenter and a general...

56:56.840 --> 56:59.798
Pilot, designer, everything.
And then just one day, gone.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.394
l"m sorry about that.
I had to leave in a hurry.

57:02.480 --> 57:04.516
A man was looking for you after you left.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.433
He"s still looking for me.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.478
- What happened?
- Shot me in the butt.

57:10.840 --> 57:13.400
Quite a game of tag you two play.
Let me see.

57:13.480 --> 57:15.948
It"s just a little buckshot.
It went straight through.

57:16.040 --> 57:19.032
Not if it"s bleeding. Let me take a look.
Take your pants down.

57:19.120 --> 57:20.439
Not out here.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.834
What are you, shy? L"ve seen it before.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.231
l"m sorry. Are you his wife?

57:32.520 --> 57:34.351
Are you kidding? No way.

57:34.440 --> 57:37.796
You two just go ahead and whatever.
l"II call a cab.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.314
That"s not a good idea.
She"s insane with fatigue.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.391
She needs something to eat,
a bed and a bath.

57:42.480 --> 57:43.833
l"m sorry.

57:43.920 --> 57:47.037
You can use the guest house
to wash up and sleep.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.680
- Jodie, can you stay the night?
- I don"t know.

57:49.960 --> 57:52.713
Go ahead, Rick. Be a sport.

57:52.800 --> 57:55.792
- She always calls me Rick.
- I won"t get in your way.

57:55.880 --> 57:58.519
- It"s not like that, really.
- Yes, it is.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.108
- It was.
- It was.

58:01.200 --> 58:04.670
He picked me up, put me back on my feet.
Showed me how to do everything.

58:04.760 --> 58:07.593
- I bet he did.
- You should see the barn.

58:07.680 --> 58:10.433
It all worked.
Every single idea you had worked.

58:10.520 --> 58:13.478
- The big animal practice is back there.
- Takes one to know one.

58:13.560 --> 58:16.632
- The horse sling"s wondertul. Want to see?
- Yeah. Let"s go.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.598
- You never saw anything work.
- I never knew it would.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.477
- It did.
- Marianne, come on.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.758
l"m sure she doesn"t want to bother.
She"s exhausted.

58:26.400 --> 58:28.630
l"d like to see that horse sling.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.876
"'Heigh-ho, Silver!"' Look at that.

58:33.960 --> 58:37.396
Isn"t that wild? They thought it was nuts
when I showed them the plans.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.596
I thought it was nuts when I did them.

58:39.680 --> 58:41.113
Come see this.

58:46.680 --> 58:50.070
- It works great.
- It works.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.991
- Nice job.
- L"m a genius.

58:52.080 --> 58:55.277
We"II let the inventor use his table.
Drop "em and hop up.

58:56.360 --> 58:58.999
- Do you need her to leave?
- L"II stay.

58:59.480 --> 59:01.152
l"ve seen it before, too.

59:01.520 --> 59:03.397
Great. You can assist.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.677
Get the peroxide and sponges
from the cabinets over there.

59:07.480 --> 59:10.597
Come on. Take your pants off
and get on the table.

59:11.400 --> 59:14.710
- Come on. Don"t be a baby.
- Be gentle with me, okay?

59:15.240 --> 59:16.798
l"II think about it.

59:17.280 --> 59:18.508
l"II be gentle.

59:23.040 --> 59:24.109
That"s cold.

59:24.200 --> 59:26.475
The cows never seem to mind.

59:26.680 --> 59:29.114
- Roll over.
- Roll over.

59:29.200 --> 59:30.633
Do I get a Milkbone?

59:34.520 --> 59:36.351
What did you have in mind?

59:36.440 --> 59:38.271
Let"s take a look.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.231
- How is it?
- Not bad, but it"s not great. Clean it up.

59:48.680 --> 59:50.511
- What"s that?
- I don"t know.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.228
Sulfuric acid.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.953
What are you doin"?

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.079
I hate those things.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.756
- You okay?
- Fine.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.193
- Feel that?
- Feel what?

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.878
- There it is.
- What?

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.669
Sponge.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.512
- I think you need a little fresh air.
- No, l"m fine.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.312
l"II send your cowboy right out.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.709
Maybe just a whiff will help me.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.719
She"s tired,
and she needs something to eat, too.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.711
So, who is she?

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.470
- She"s just an old friend.
- Yeah, right.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.790
- Really. An old friend.
- Are you sure about that?

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.910
When you got a knife up my ass, I am.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.912
How bad is it,
this "'thing"' you"re running from?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.149
Pretty bad.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.837
Think you"d ever beat it
and want to come back here someday?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.751
If I could beat it, l"d go anywhere.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.479
l"m asking because
l"m engaged to be married.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.994
"'Flagellations."' That"s great.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.230
l"d rethink it...

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.552
...if I thought you might
come back this way someday.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.079
You always were direct, Rachel.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.352
- You"re done.
- Thanks.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.599
How long have I got?

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.878
The wedding"s on Sunday.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.590
l"m a bad bet, you know.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.839
Much happiness. Come here.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.597
Excuse me for a minute.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.918
You never hustled like that
when I was angry.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.634
Are you okay?

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.676
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.230
I need a phone to get out of here
so you two can live happily ever after.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.356
It"s not like that. She was...

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.556
In your arms and you were naked. I saw it.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.029
- It"s nothing.
- And my name is Dumbo. Who cares?

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.031
What"s it to you? Why should you care?

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.429
- You"re happily married, yeah?
- L"m not.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.996
- You"re not happy?
- Not married.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.911
- No?
- It just didn"t work out.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.794
He was a prick.
You"re better off without him.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.716
My heart can"t take this again.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.350
Remember the time I saw
that flying saucer?

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.318
We were smoking
some pretty heavy stuff back then.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.272
I think I see another one.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.434
What"s that?

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.839
Friends of yours?

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.631
- Go! L"II stay here.
- Right.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.992
Let"s get out of here!

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.355
- "Bye, Rach. Thanks a lot.
- L"II cover you.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.069
Let"s fly.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.879
l"m gonna kill you!

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.480
- Hurry up, Rick!
- Ready for this?

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.318
Tie down your toupee.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.069
- Can"t this thing go any faster?
- This is as fast as it goes!

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.789
Hang on!

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.596
Oh, my God!

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.559
l"m gonna throw up!

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.070
l"m not kidding!

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.629
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- I gotta take his rotor out.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.878
- What the hell?
- What"s he doing?

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.235
Slow down! He"s cutting up the rotor!

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.474
We"re goin" down!

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.196
If you"ve got a belt, put it on.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.919
And stick your head between your knees.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.833
- What do I do now?
- Kiss your ass good-bye.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.275
We got no wheels and we"re comin" down.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.713
I don"t want to die!

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.112
Are we dead?

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.749
No.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.194
But we will be if we don"t get out of here.
This can"t be good for you.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.508
Help me.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.315
Hang on.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.193
Let"s go. This thing still might blow up.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.675
It"s been five years.
I haven"t lost my touch.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.069
It"s like riding a bicycle.
You never forget it.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.871
I can"t take this anymore.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.709
l"m gonna go on the road and hitchhike.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.909
I don"t care if they catch us and we die.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.992
I need food. I need a bath.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.399
I need a bed.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.113
I need a massage.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.919
I need a manicure.
I need to see my therapist.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.992
I need a beer. Look at that.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.752
It"s the promised land.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.470
We have no money and no credit cards.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.796
l"II talk to the guy in charge.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.511
Give him this.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.955
- Give him my watch.
- Hold me down.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.075
If they don"t take that, sell my body.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.871
I don"t care.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.680
l"II try and get there
early afternoon tomorrow.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.078
Thank you. "Bye.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.314
Right here. Hallway.
See you in the morning.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.037
Tomorrow at 7:30, before you know it.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.997
- Thanks, Norman.
- Good night.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:28.707
Hiya, pooch.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.430
- Marianne, are you in this one?
- There"s no lock and no door handle.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.511
Watch the door. It falls of the hinges.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.990
Why didn"t you choose another one?
The guy said, "'Take your pick."'

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.390
- The only one with a TV.
- So there is. Civilization.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.310
I wonder if we"re on the news.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:46.469
Shit!

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.395
There was nothing good on anyway.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.675
l"ve just taken a shower.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.237
l"m wearing a towel.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.358
l"m hanging up my clothes.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.831
This is interesting narration.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.910
l"d appreciate your not watching me.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.911
There"s nothing else to watch.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.399
Speaking of watches, l"ve still got yours.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.518
I didn"t give it to the guy.
We"II need it tomorrow anyway.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.830
We"II have to get a car or something.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.319
Lou Baird said he wants to see me
in person.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.870
I was talking to his sister.
I tried to tell her the problem.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.392
But she said it wasn"t a good idea
to discuss it on the phone.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.311
- Why?
- I don"t know.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.034
- Was the phone tapped or something?
- God.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.315
I knew you"d say that. I hope not.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.795
Don"t go there. Call the police.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.432
You know I can"t do that.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.637
Why are you so paranoid about the police?
They can help you.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.678
l"m half a day"s drive away
from Lou Baird"s. L"m not going...

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.830
How do you know
he"s not part of the setup?

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.319
Because he isn"t.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.597
He"s saved my hide too many times
to want to kill me now.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.799
Tomorrow morning,
we"II find the nearest town...

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.873
...swap your watch for some old junker,
and everything will be just fine.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.952
I know what l"m doing.
Have you got a towel?

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.992
That"s not a towel.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.755
- Who"s gonna pay for this hotel room?
- They need a chambermaid.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.309
- A chambermaid?
- L"II help you.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.039
It"s only 12 units.
It won"t take us very long.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.120
- Are you mumbling? What are you doing?
- Good luck.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.112
- L"m out of here in the morning.
- I gave this guy my word.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.919
I didn"t, all right?
l"II call my office in the morning...

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.468
...have them express mail some money,
pay the guy off.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.030
l"II buy this goddamn place,
if necessary, and l"m out of here.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.510
- Calm down. What"s eating you?
- Calm down?

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.388
I just took a shower with a cockroach
from hell. He"s doing his hair now.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.472
Not to mention that you"ve sold me
into human bondage.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.230
- You really are spoiled.
- Yes, I am.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.039
Then being a chambermaid
might do you some good.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.394
God!

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.153
- Stop that shit.
- What shit?

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.037
That mumbling
has always driven me crazy.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.351
Did you ever wonder why we got together
in the first place?

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.388
Do we ever agree on anything?
Did your personality ever not annoy me?

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.233
- Sex.
- Sex.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.550
- I really don"t remember.
- You really don"t?

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.119
I don"t think you do either.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.351
I think this is a cheap trick
"cause l"m getting into bed with you.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.591
- I wouldn"t worry about me.
- Anyway, I have a boyfriend.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.517
A very wondertul boyfriend.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.154
- Who"s this boyfriend?
- How"d I know you"d ask me that?

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.356
- Why shouldn"t I?
- You"II just belittle him.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.192
- I would not.
- You will. I know you.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.633
Have it your way.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.831
- Please stay above the covers.
- Why?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.388
My towel is wet. I have to get out of it.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.229
I guess so.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.912
That"s better.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.988
Thank you.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.312
Tell me about this boyfriend.
What"s he like in the sack?

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.038
Can he thrill the lake?

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.475
l"m not discussing sex with you tonight.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.714
I haven"t had a girlfriend in five years.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.193
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.791
Mr. Wiggly"s been on bread and water
for five long years.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.911
- Is that the truth?
- Yeah.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.270
I didn"t think it would be fair.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.194
You cold?

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.429
Not really.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.591
Feels familiar, doesn"t it?

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.595
Thought you said you didn"t remember.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.915
I feel kind of selfish under here.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.198
You are very selfish,
and not just under there.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.711
- Too bad you said that.
- Why?

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.349
I was actually beginning to get turned on.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.874
- Too bad for you. I wasn"t.
- You weren"t?

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.109
- No.
- Fine.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.115
Stop that, will you? If you do that again...

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.829
You can"t tell me what to do, okay?
I can"t help it.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.634
What are you gonna do,
add another felony to your list of crimes?

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.789
Go to sleep.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.515
I can"t. What"s the name of this boyfriend?
Tell me. L"II be nice.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.672
You will? Okay. His name is Paul.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.711
Sounds like a dipshit. Anyone named Paul
is probably a spot welder.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.317
Shut up. Go to sleep.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.912
- Is that true?
- What?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.874
About five years?

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.320
- Thought you didn"t want to discuss it.
- I don"t.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.072
- Then shut up.
- Shut up?

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.718
Yeah, l"II shut up.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.595
God.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.912
Let me look at you.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.119
I missed you.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.196
God, I missed you.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.668
Doesn"t this feel right?

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.432
I had that dream again.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.239
Remember the dream I used to have
after we made love?

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.356
The one about the Seven Dwarts?

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.153
Remember the dream,
we were in the middle of the ocean...

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.549
...and it was that really big sailboat?

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.153
- Yeah.
- We were alone.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.075
There was nobody around. It was just us.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.391
- That"s a nice dream.
- Can"t we do that?

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.437
Can"t we find a way?

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.829
l"ve spent 15 years looking for it.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.237
If I could"ve found it,
l"d have come and got you, married or not.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.958
- Would you really?
- Yeah.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.396
But there"s nothing we can do now.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.632
We gotta get out of here.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.315
l"m gonna see what kind of car
I can get with that watch of yours.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.917
There must be a way.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.551
Yeah?

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.234
Paul? Marianne. No, l"m fine.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.514
l"m really all right.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.392
I can"t talk. L"m fine.
I just need you to help us.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.914
I need you to call someone. Please.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.479
Yes, damn it!

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.678
- I don"t have enough time.
- Marianne, your chariot awaits you.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.115
- Just do it! I gotta go.
- Where are you hiding?

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.760
Better pick it up, hot legs. We gotta go.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.717
- Hi.
- You found me.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.791
Wait till you see what I got for you.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.348
- Bring it on out here.
- There"s your watch.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.237
- What a beauty.
- You think so?

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.153
Fine piece of equipment.
Look at this little jewel here.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.516
I had to grind him down,
but he finally accepted my terms.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.592
Hello. Extension 2200, please.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.315
Hello?

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.273
Yes, Mr. Bernhardt.
Of course I remember you.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.278
They"re headed where?

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.799
She wants federal marshals
and some members of the press there.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.429
You did the right thing by calling me.
I can take care of all that.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.471
No, you wait by the phone.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.072
We"II make sure she"s safe.
You don"t have to worry.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.799
You bet. Thank you.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.797
All right. End of the line.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:10.071
Jesus, we"re overheating.
We"re lucky to get here at all.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.838
Hang on. Wait for me.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.670
The lights are on, so I guess
there must be somebody in there.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.749
Lou.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.760
- It"s me, Rick.
- In a minute.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.711
Stubborn old guy, isn"t he?

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.112
You mind if we come in?

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.996
l"II see you at the front door.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.956
- Lou.
- Yes?

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.438
It"s me, Rick Jarmin.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.833
My Lord. So it is.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.355
Jeez, Lou.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.112
Come on in. Hi.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.589
- This is Marianne Graves.
- How do you do?

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.239
You scared the hell out of me.
I thought you forgot who I was.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.308
I damn near did.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.755
l"d be in big trouble then,
"cause l"m in a spot...

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.957
...and you"re about the only guy
in the world who can help me out.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.553
Where do I start?

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.108
They finally let Sorenson out of the cage.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:25.557
He and Diggs are after us, and they seem
to know every move we"re making.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.234
I think somebody at the Bureau
is doing us in.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.793
I work at the zoo.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.350
- L"ve got connections there.
- You placed me there, remember?

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.908
It"s just down the block.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.992
I can find it every time, even in the dark.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.957
Molly likes it that way.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.479
Are you Monty?

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.030
l"m sorry. I didn"t hear the bell.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.189
Are you the young man who was calling?

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.519
I told you I didn"t think he"d remember.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.716
That"s why I thought
you should come here.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.758
Sometimes it helps if he sees a face.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.596
Ma"am, do you know who that is?

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.677
Those are federal marshals. I called them.
I thought this was a setup.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.274
Even if it isn"t a setup,
you have to talk to them.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.271
You can"t keep running...

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.993
You"re right about one thing.
There"s nowhere else to run.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.310
- You have a basement here?
- It"s off the kitchen.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.437
- Can you show it to me?
- What have I done? L"m sorry.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.989
It"s designed as a bomb shelter.
No one can get in here.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.753
Go and lock yourselves in.
Don"t come out till it"s quiet.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.310
- Where are you going, Rick?
- I don"t know, Lou.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.914
How about the zoo? They got guns there.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.958
- You know every inch of the way.
- That"s a good idea.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.869
Zoo.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:23.910
Hello?

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.509
Hurry up!

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.792
You got nothing to fear. Joe Weyburn.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.872
- Aren"t those guys gonna follow us?
- Damn well better.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.358
They"ve changed the code.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.109
Not now!

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.075
- How did you...?
- I can"t believe I did that.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.274
- Come on.
- Wait.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.198
You didn"t see us, Bob, okay?

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.918
That"s gotta be them.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.829
Be careful.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:30.835
Stationery.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.354
Where is it?
Where do they put these things?

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.270
- They used to have real guns here.
- What"s that?

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.078
That"s a tranquilizer gun.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.034
l"m sorry.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.757
l"m sorry I did this to you.
I called them on you.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.599
That"s all right.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.671
I should be apologizing to you.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.110
It"s probably for the best.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.512
- Fifteen years is long enough.
- Yeah, it is.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.273
Lock the doors and stay in here
no matter what you see.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.157
Don"t come out. Just stay in here.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.879
If you see me do this,
I want you to hit this button.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.712
See what it does?

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.916
See those lights there? It turns them on.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.877
Just like that, okay?

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.998
Keep your head down.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.074
Please live through this.
I can"t go to another one of your funerals.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.670
You remember, you stay in here.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.791
"Cause it"s a zoo out there.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.399
Which one did he say?

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.919
Rick? It"s Joe Weyburn.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.078
We don"t mean you any harm.
We just want to talk.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.230
Welcome to the tropical rain forest.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.232
We have assembled a collection
of flora and fauna...

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.518
...indigenous to both the South American
rain forest and the African Savannah.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.389
There.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.756
Shit!

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.559
Think I got him!

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.919
Gotta stop this thing somehow.
Go get that girl!

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.230
Yeah!

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.313
Wake up! All of ya! Get up!

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.954
Rise and shine! Get up!

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.957
Come on, fellas. Give me a hand.

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.433
Shut up! Get back.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.474
Shut up!

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.239
Shit.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.994
Excuse me.

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.428
Surprise!

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.794
Come on. Hands behind your head.
Fingers clenched.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.869
Now!

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.269
What is that shit? Get over there!

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.429
Spread them!

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.588
I got him! I got Jarmin!

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.750
What do you need him for?
Why don"t you...

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.752
No, buddy, this is his kill.
Means a lot to him.

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.389
My head.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.352
I got your lady here.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.000
Come out, or l"II throw her to the tigers.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.274
You"re wrong, Rick,
if you think I won"t do it!

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.991
Don"t you even want to watch?

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.071
l"d hate for you to miss this.

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.799
Fifteen years!

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.439
Fifteen years l"ve waited for this!

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.353
It"s me.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:07.992
It"s me. Take my hand.

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.395
Please!

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.437
I can"t hold on.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.795
Yes, you can. Come on, honey.
You can do it.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.110
Just pull me towards you.

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.668
l"m sorry I can"t get you out of this.

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.315
Me, too. Listen.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.551
l"m free now. I could marry you.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.676
You liar. You wouldn"t marry me.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.515
I could if you"d just
put a little extra effort in.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.113
A little extra effort?

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.479
Instead of just watching the father
of your children become tiger meat!

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.119
- Children?
- Children.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.038
Are you all right, honey?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.194
Who are you?

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.473
Look at me.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.075
Rick, look at me. L"m Marianne.

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.118
Remember we were gonna get married
and have children?

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.030
l"m pleased to meet you, Marianne.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.318
You dirty rat! Don"t even try
to weasel out of this one.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.710
- L"II sue you for breach of promise!
- I haven"t got any money.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.519
- What"II you get, my underpants?
- I want your underpants.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.476
I got something I want to show you.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.149
Get up. Get your lazy ass off.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.439
You"ve heard that expression:

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.830
"'Something old, something new,
something borrowed and something..."'

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.148
Very blue.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.757
Mr. Wiggly is unfurled.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.910
And if that"s not a hint, what is?
