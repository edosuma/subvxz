WEBVTT

00:17.150 --> 00:18.516
You got the wrong guy, talia.

00:20.286 --> 00:22.119
I'm your partner.

00:23.055 --> 00:25.055
I know who you are.

00:25.057 --> 00:27.690
I am more concerned
with who you aren't.

00:27.692 --> 00:29.591
I'm not who you think I am.

00:29.593 --> 00:31.092
That's funny, you know?

00:31.094 --> 00:32.760
I liked who
I thought you were.

00:32.762 --> 00:34.194
That's not what I meant.

00:34.196 --> 00:36.296
Tell me who you're not, mark.

00:36.298 --> 00:38.097
I'm not a traitor.

00:40.634 --> 00:43.635
Dea server records has you
logging into our top secret

00:43.637 --> 00:46.537
Informants list
and uploading 200 gigs of data

00:46.539 --> 00:49.139
Onto an
unauthorized thumb drive.

00:49.141 --> 00:50.640
You denying that?

00:50.642 --> 00:52.141
No.

00:52.143 --> 00:54.109
Hmm, so you're exactly

00:54.111 --> 00:56.344
Who I think you are, partner.

00:56.346 --> 00:59.080
Turning traitor is a choice.

00:59.082 --> 01:00.514
Betraying everything you know

01:00.516 --> 01:03.483
And love is a choice, talia.

01:04.752 --> 01:06.184
Taking away your choices

01:06.186 --> 01:08.085
Is the first thing they do.

01:09.822 --> 01:11.288
Who's taken away your choices?

01:11.290 --> 01:13.623
My name is agent mark moore.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.725
I am your partner,
and that is all real.

01:15.727 --> 01:19.095
Mark, you tell me
who's controlling you.

01:19.097 --> 01:21.397
Tell me what's going on.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.302
(sighs)

01:27.304 --> 01:29.270
I'm sorry.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.868
Steak tartare at le voltaire
in paris at sunset.

02:02.870 --> 02:04.369
Tartare as in raw meat?

02:04.371 --> 02:05.870
Mm-hmm,
practically still breathing.

02:05.872 --> 02:07.638
Ew.

02:07.639 --> 02:09.405
The<i> saba</i> at jiro ono's
bar in tokyo,

02:09.408 --> 02:12.509
But only the original joint
at the ginza metro station.

02:12.511 --> 02:13.677
What is<i> saba?</i>

02:13.678 --> 02:14.844
A skinless mackerel,
but usually

02:14.846 --> 02:17.780
The 14th piece of
jiro-san's<i> omakase.</i>

02:17.782 --> 02:19.648
Hey, uh,
did you get that fixed?

02:19.650 --> 02:21.216
Get what fixed?

02:21.218 --> 02:22.550
The problem with the plumbing
at your new place?

02:22.552 --> 02:24.218
Oh, yeah, no,
still working on that.

02:24.220 --> 02:25.352
Couple more days, I guess.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.853
What are they doing?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.555
I don't know, you know?

02:28.556 --> 02:30.256
They're plumbers--
a lot of pipes and butt cracks.

02:30.258 --> 02:31.590
Callen: Kens?
Yeah?

02:31.592 --> 02:33.191
Your turn.
Sorry.

02:33.193 --> 02:36.194
1975 château d'yquem.

02:36.196 --> 02:38.696
Since when did alcohol qualify
as someone's best meal ever?

02:38.698 --> 02:40.264
(phone rings)
okay.

02:40.266 --> 02:42.432
White truffle menu,

02:42.434 --> 02:43.699
Giorgio baldi. Boom.

02:43.701 --> 02:45.367
Which dish?

02:45.369 --> 02:47.369
(whispering):
All of them.
All of them?

02:47.371 --> 02:50.205
You did the entire white truffle
tasting menu at giorgio's?

02:50.207 --> 02:51.873
Mm-hmm.
Last supper style?

02:51.875 --> 02:53.174
(phone rings)
oh, yeah, last supper style.

02:53.176 --> 02:56.510
Sorry, plumber still.

02:56.512 --> 02:58.512
Kensi (clears throat):
I had, uh,

02:58.514 --> 03:00.213
Every single dish.

03:00.215 --> 03:01.514
I'm impressed.

03:01.516 --> 03:02.781
It was amazing.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.250
That you had that epic meal
all by yourself.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.518
Oh, well, I didn't have it
all by myself.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.187
Here we go.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.721
Oh, you are the man, deeks.

03:11.723 --> 03:15.791
Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams.

03:15.793 --> 03:17.893
He spares no expense
for his lady.

03:17.895 --> 03:19.294
Since we're talking
about giorgio baldi's,

03:19.296 --> 03:21.362
That's the kind of place
that you spring for

03:21.364 --> 03:22.529
When you're about
to freaking propose.

03:22.531 --> 03:23.630
Aah.

03:23.632 --> 03:26.199
Don't answer that question.

03:26.201 --> 03:27.466
You didn't ask a question.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.433
Exactly.

03:29.469 --> 03:31.169
Well, this just got weird.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.870
The topic of conversation
was best meals ever.

03:32.872 --> 03:34.238
White truffles it is.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.639
High-priced plates of fungi.

03:35.641 --> 03:37.307
That's really interesting,
actually,

03:37.309 --> 03:39.609
Because I think it was you and I

03:39.611 --> 03:41.377
(clears throat)
over a plate of nachos

03:41.379 --> 03:43.312
At the clippers-spurs game
when you told me

03:43.314 --> 03:46.448
That a meal is all about the
person you're sharing it with.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.650
Baby, those nachos were

03:48.652 --> 03:51.219
Just the most amazing nachos

03:51.221 --> 03:53.221
I have ever had.

03:53.223 --> 03:54.355
But not like

03:54.357 --> 03:55.289
Last supper good.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.974
(laughs)

03:56.975 --> 03:58.658
I think we ought to put the lid
back on this can of worms.

03:58.661 --> 04:00.427
Nah, they can close it
themselves.
(whistles)

04:00.429 --> 04:02.262
Caught a case. Double homicide.

04:02.264 --> 04:03.429
Bon appétit.

04:05.199 --> 04:06.298
(phone rings)

04:07.534 --> 04:08.633
Plumbers?

04:08.635 --> 04:10.401
Yeah, no, plumbers.

04:10.403 --> 04:12.369
But they can
handle this themselves.

04:12.371 --> 04:14.537
As one can of worms closes...

04:14.539 --> 04:17.472
An even bigger one springs up
in its place.

04:20.910 --> 04:22.309
Security guard watched
the whole thing

04:22.311 --> 04:24.061
On the camera feed.

04:24.062 --> 04:25.812
When he realized talia was
about to get a full confession,

04:25.814 --> 04:27.246
He went big.

04:27.248 --> 04:28.880
Moore was a traitor.

04:28.882 --> 04:31.916
He didn't know the guy
who shot him was a traitor, too.

04:31.918 --> 04:34.451
The dea exposed two moles,
and it's not even lunch.

04:34.453 --> 04:36.820
They want an outside agency
to investigate.

04:36.822 --> 04:38.454
Well, talia's worked
with us before.

04:38.456 --> 04:39.822
Probably trusts ncis
more than her own people.

04:39.824 --> 04:41.423
Where is she?
Nell:
She went on the run

04:41.425 --> 04:43.625
After the shooting
and then got in touch with us.

04:43.627 --> 04:44.892
At the moment, she's laying low
at her safe house

04:44.894 --> 04:46.526
In los feliz.

04:46.528 --> 04:48.144
Talia had evidence

04:48.145 --> 04:49.761
That agent moore used
his top secret clearance

04:49.764 --> 04:51.296
To bootleg

04:51.298 --> 04:53.831
The dea's drug cartel
informant list.

04:53.833 --> 04:54.798
Kensi:
Have we secured

04:54.800 --> 04:56.366
The duplicate?
Uh, no.

04:56.368 --> 04:57.567
The dea can only confirm

04:57.569 --> 04:58.834
That the list
was transferred

04:58.836 --> 05:00.235
To a thumb drive.

05:00.237 --> 05:02.370
A team was sent
to agent moore's residence

05:02.372 --> 05:04.004
In hancock park,
but they didn't find anything.

05:04.006 --> 05:05.372
Friends, family?

05:05.374 --> 05:06.506
Uh, yeah.

05:06.508 --> 05:07.874
Emily moore,

05:07.876 --> 05:09.508
His wife, she's an
interior designer.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.942
Got a team watching her now.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.410
She hasn't moved
from the house

05:12.411 --> 05:13.877
Since getting the news that
her husband was killed.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.146
Sam:
Any connection

05:15.147 --> 05:16.413
Between moore
and the guard who shot him?

05:16.415 --> 05:17.547
Nell:
Just one.

05:17.549 --> 05:18.981
Citadel behavioral research.

05:18.983 --> 05:22.284
I think you're all
familiar with the name.

05:22.286 --> 05:23.885
Kensi: Yes, we are. I wouldn't
be here if we weren't.

05:23.887 --> 05:25.786
Premier psychological
assessment firm

05:25.788 --> 05:27.621
Under direct contract
with the federal government.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.789
They spent six months
digging through my life

05:29.791 --> 05:31.657
Before I got the job
offer to work here.

05:31.659 --> 05:33.925
Grade school report cards,
interviewing neighbors,

05:33.927 --> 05:36.594
Polygraphs, they did a
full-body cavity search

05:36.596 --> 05:37.828
Of my life.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.396
Charming. So charming.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.297
Graphic.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.565
Citadel vetted moore and the
security guard that killed him.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.833
Best assessment team
in the world

05:45.835 --> 05:48.635
Struck out twice with
the same agency?

05:48.637 --> 05:50.637
Best case scenario,

05:50.639 --> 05:52.472
Criminal negligence.

05:52.474 --> 05:54.574
Worst case scenario,

05:54.576 --> 05:55.942
Conspiracy inside the firm.

05:55.944 --> 05:57.243
Mm-hmm.

05:57.244 --> 05:58.543
Why don't you take talia
with you

05:58.546 --> 05:59.745
To interview emily moore?

05:59.747 --> 06:01.012
Okay.
Where's hetty?

06:01.014 --> 06:02.613
Eric: She's on a flight
back from dc.

06:02.615 --> 06:04.915
Make sure she's fully briefed
by the time she lands.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.350
What are you and sam gonna do?
We'll hit citadel.

06:07.352 --> 06:09.018
Infiltrate the most secure
intelligence firm on the planet?

06:09.020 --> 06:11.587
I like to start
my week off right.

06:14.758 --> 06:17.291
Deeks: Busted her partner
for treason,

06:17.293 --> 06:18.392
Watched him get shot,

06:18.394 --> 06:19.893
And then shot the guy
that killed him

06:19.895 --> 06:21.461
All in the same morning.

06:21.463 --> 06:22.795
That's a tough day.

06:22.797 --> 06:23.962
Well, she's a tough girl.

06:23.964 --> 06:25.463
Is everything okay?

06:25.465 --> 06:26.497
Yeah, why?

06:26.499 --> 06:27.798
I'm getting a weird vibe.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.333
So am I.
Maybe an earthquake is coming.

06:29.334 --> 06:30.867
Something going on with the
internal affairs investigation?

06:30.869 --> 06:32.034
Oh, look, we're here.

06:32.036 --> 06:34.069
I know you're not gonna
knock on that door

06:34.071 --> 06:35.837
Without answering
my question.
(knocking)

06:35.839 --> 06:38.505
Talia, it's kensi and deeks.

06:41.676 --> 06:44.376
Kensi, it's good
to see you.

06:44.378 --> 06:46.444
Never thought I'd
hear myself say that.

06:46.446 --> 06:48.679
We're here for you.

06:48.681 --> 06:50.580
I know what it's like
to lose a partner.

06:50.582 --> 06:52.582
Thank you.

06:52.584 --> 06:54.650
Hey.
Hey.

06:56.487 --> 06:57.886
Deeks, you are looking good.

06:57.888 --> 07:00.321
I never thought I'd hear
myself say that, either.

07:00.323 --> 07:01.588
(chuckles)

07:01.590 --> 07:03.590
Makes two of us.

07:03.592 --> 07:04.958
I still can't believe
mark got flipped.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.926
15 years with the dea.

07:06.928 --> 07:08.560
I mean, I should have
figured it out

07:08.562 --> 07:09.928
Before he fell in over his head.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.462
Any idea who flipped him?

07:11.464 --> 07:12.830
No.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.798
He said something that stuck.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.799
"taking away your choices

07:16.801 --> 07:18.066
Is the first thing they do."

07:20.937 --> 07:22.069
(rapid gunshots)

07:22.071 --> 07:23.870
Deeks:
Get down!

07:26.040 --> 07:28.106
(tires squealing)

07:28.108 --> 07:29.807
You good?

07:29.809 --> 07:32.075
Yeah, I'm good.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.076
Move! Go, go, go!

07:34.078 --> 07:35.410
Let's go, let's go!

07:35.412 --> 07:36.778
(tires squealing)

07:40.950 --> 07:43.417
Well, the first thing they do
is take away your choices.

07:43.419 --> 07:46.420
Evidently the second thing
they do is kill you.

08:00.736 --> 08:02.569
Thanks, eric.
All right, keep us posted.

08:02.571 --> 08:05.805
Team of shooters just emptied
a couple dozen rounds

08:05.807 --> 08:08.874
Into the safe house and took off
in an unmarked van.

08:08.876 --> 08:10.775
Lapd found the van
about three miles away,

08:10.777 --> 08:12.610
Wiped clean.

08:12.612 --> 08:13.811
How'd they find her?

08:13.813 --> 08:15.712
Talia's cell phone,
which was encrypted

08:15.714 --> 08:17.947
With the dea's
latest technology.

08:17.949 --> 08:20.950
Security breach goes
a lot deeper than we thought.

08:20.952 --> 08:23.919
Well, whoever turned moore
is trying to cover their tracks.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.087
They think talia
was gonna pull it together.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.889
It's time to see if those tracks
run through citadel.

08:28.891 --> 08:31.091
Eric and nell hacked
their system.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.093
They have us set up
as a couple of operatives

08:33.095 --> 08:34.928
Trying to get jobs at the cia.

08:34.930 --> 08:36.429
It's enough to get us
in the door.

08:36.431 --> 08:37.730
The rest is up to us.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.465
There's a lot of ground
to cover in that building

08:39.467 --> 08:40.999
And not a lot of time.

08:41.001 --> 08:42.900
Shooters are gonna take
another crack at talia,

08:42.902 --> 08:44.101
Sooner than later.
All right.

08:44.103 --> 08:45.569
We're gonna split up.

08:45.571 --> 08:46.903
One passes, one fails.

08:46.905 --> 08:48.771
Firms this big

08:48.773 --> 08:50.806
Have separate teams
to process each outcome,

08:50.808 --> 08:52.841
Conduct the exit interviews.

08:52.843 --> 08:54.843
We'll cover
twice as much ground.

08:54.845 --> 08:56.811
Yeah, it's déjà vu
all over again.

08:56.813 --> 08:58.979
I remember citadel's hl-7 test

08:58.981 --> 09:01.548
When we were up for top
secret clearance years ago.

09:01.550 --> 09:03.850
I pass, you fail.

09:03.852 --> 09:06.652
When did I say that I'm gonna be
the one that fails?

09:06.654 --> 09:07.886
I've never failed a test
in my life.

09:07.888 --> 09:09.554
I'm not starting today.

09:09.556 --> 09:11.822
Well, sam hanna's
not taking the test.

09:11.824 --> 09:14.157
A fake person is.

09:14.159 --> 09:16.425
You've honestly never failed
a test in your life?

09:16.427 --> 09:17.959
Never.
That's not even possible.

09:17.961 --> 09:20.628
I mean, everyone fails
at some point.

09:20.630 --> 09:21.762
It's called being human.

09:21.764 --> 09:22.863
I'm glad you're
so comfortable

09:22.865 --> 09:24.598
Being human.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.700
I pass, you fail.

09:26.702 --> 09:27.934
Okay.

09:27.936 --> 09:30.469
I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten.

09:30.471 --> 09:32.003
You have one guess.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.604
You guess the right answer,

09:33.606 --> 09:35.672
You get to be the one
who passes.

09:35.674 --> 09:36.673
(chuckles)
that's not fair.

09:36.675 --> 09:37.774
It's a test.

09:37.776 --> 09:38.875
No, it's a pop quiz.

09:38.877 --> 09:39.976
Oh, see, now you're stalling.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.210
How do I know you're not gonna

09:41.212 --> 09:42.878
Change the number
just to mess with me?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.013
One guess.

09:49.486 --> 09:50.685
Nine.

09:50.687 --> 09:53.054
Explain your answer.

09:54.857 --> 09:56.056
Last time we were in vegas,

09:56.058 --> 09:58.058
You put $100 down
on the number nine

09:58.060 --> 09:59.526
At the roulette table.

09:59.528 --> 10:02.095
We need to get going.

10:02.097 --> 10:03.529
Am I right?

10:03.531 --> 10:04.696
I'm happy to be the one

10:04.698 --> 10:06.464
Who fails the test, okay?

10:06.466 --> 10:08.199
Because I got your number right.

10:08.201 --> 10:09.633
We got a lot of work to do.

10:09.635 --> 10:11.034
I got a reputation
to uphold.

10:11.036 --> 10:12.702
Sam hanna doesn't fail.

10:12.704 --> 10:15.071
Hey, am I right?

10:20.645 --> 10:21.844
This is it.

10:21.846 --> 10:23.429
This is emily moore's place.

10:23.430 --> 10:25.013
You think
she's somehow involved?

10:25.015 --> 10:26.714
Never met her.

10:26.716 --> 10:28.215
I'm sorry.

10:28.217 --> 10:29.983
You were mark moore's partner
for 15 years,

10:29.985 --> 10:31.250
And you never met his wife?
Nope.

10:31.252 --> 10:33.885
He wanted to protect her
from his work.
Huh.

10:33.887 --> 10:36.621
Sounds like your partner
was hiding something from you.

10:36.623 --> 10:38.656
Or he just wanted
to keep his work stress

10:38.658 --> 10:40.057
Separate from his home stress.

10:40.059 --> 10:41.758
Ooh, whoever said talia
was stressing him out?

10:41.760 --> 10:44.527
I'm just-- I'm talking
about the job as a whole.

10:44.529 --> 10:47.029
I think hiding stuff
is a bad idea.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.065
Do you have any idea what
she's talking about right now?

10:50.067 --> 10:52.067
You are an idiot.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.151
That was
a rhetorical question.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.234
Why did you spend
the last two nights

10:54.237 --> 10:55.536
Alone in your apartment?

10:55.538 --> 10:57.871
Definitely not rhetorical.

10:57.873 --> 10:59.172
I was cleaning up
after the plumbers,

10:59.174 --> 11:00.740
If you have to know.

11:00.742 --> 11:02.208
Oh, the plumbers don't
clean up after themselves?

11:02.210 --> 11:03.742
Not to my standard.
Uh-huh.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.076
Maybe yours.
Oh.

11:05.078 --> 11:07.244
But I'm not, you know,
living in squalor.

11:07.246 --> 11:09.246
Mark didn't introduce me
to his wife

11:09.248 --> 11:11.915
Because we, uh, pulled
all-nighters on cases together.

11:11.917 --> 11:14.284
And I look like this.

11:14.286 --> 11:16.986
And he didn't want his wife
to get the wrong idea.

11:16.988 --> 11:18.988
Which, I mean, I get, you know?

11:18.990 --> 11:21.190
In a hurry, I probably would
have gotten the wrong idea, too.

11:23.027 --> 11:25.160
Anyone that you're protecting
from your work, talia?

11:25.162 --> 11:26.628
Talia:
Of course not, deeks.

11:26.630 --> 11:28.062
I'm still
waiting around for you.

11:28.064 --> 11:29.730
Oh.

11:29.732 --> 11:30.797
Okay.

11:30.799 --> 11:32.031
Yeah.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.533
(car door opens)
sorry about that.

11:34.535 --> 11:36.535
(car door closes)
I know, I'm gonna take
the high road on this one.

11:36.537 --> 11:38.003
As opposed to?
Bleeding her out.

11:38.005 --> 11:39.104
Yeah, no,
that's an option.

11:46.746 --> 11:48.746
Man:<i> You'll be</i>
<i> undergoing phase three</i>

11:48.748 --> 11:50.748
Of the citadel assessment
protocols today.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.216
Yeah?
What's phase three?

11:52.218 --> 11:53.750
The hl-7 test.

11:53.752 --> 11:55.084
Have a seat, please.

11:55.086 --> 11:56.285
Sounds like a party.

11:58.088 --> 12:00.088
(sighs)

12:00.090 --> 12:02.090
Male voice:
Welcome to phase three

12:02.092 --> 12:03.758
Of the citadel
assessment protocols.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.761
Please pay attention
to these instructions.

12:06.763 --> 12:09.096
You will be presented
with a series of images.

12:09.098 --> 12:10.764
Upon seeing each image,

12:10.766 --> 12:12.999
State the first phrase
that comes into your mind.

12:13.001 --> 12:15.001
Let's do this.

12:15.003 --> 12:16.870
Please speak clearly.

12:16.871 --> 12:18.738
Your responses will
be monitored and evaluated

12:18.740 --> 12:20.906
By citadel technicians.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.140
Let's get this over with.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.142
Sam:
Father.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.044
Uh...

12:28.046 --> 12:30.145
Collateral damage.

12:33.116 --> 12:35.349
Freedom.
(machine beeps rapidly)

12:35.351 --> 12:37.884
Technician: Mr. Michaels,
is everything okay?

12:37.886 --> 12:39.018
(beeping slows)
uh, yeah.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.886
No, I'm-I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

12:40.888 --> 12:43.154
Technician:
Resuming phase three now.

12:44.624 --> 12:46.757
Fairy tale.
Commitment.

12:46.759 --> 12:48.091
Escape.

12:48.093 --> 12:49.158
Trident.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.792
(beeping briefly accelerates)

12:50.794 --> 12:52.126
Sam:
<i> Forgiveness.</i>

12:52.128 --> 12:54.828
Father.

12:56.364 --> 12:58.030
Father.

12:58.032 --> 13:01.099
Second chance.

13:01.101 --> 13:02.866
Serenity.

13:05.337 --> 13:06.936
Father.

13:08.806 --> 13:10.138
Family.

13:10.140 --> 13:12.339
(beeping accelerates)

13:15.143 --> 13:17.009
Callen:
I'm getting out.

13:17.011 --> 13:19.344
That's enough.

13:19.346 --> 13:21.012
I was on my way to work,

13:21.014 --> 13:22.880
Thinking nothing could
possibly hurt more

13:22.882 --> 13:26.350
Than these new heels mark
gave me for our anniversary.

13:26.352 --> 13:30.354
Specifically the one
crushing my left foot.

13:30.356 --> 13:32.723
Then the phone rang and...

13:32.725 --> 13:35.726
Well...

13:35.728 --> 13:38.628
Put pain in a whole new
perspective for me.

13:44.001 --> 13:47.002
Mark was involved
with some pretty bad people.

13:47.004 --> 13:50.672
Is there anything
that stuck out to you?

13:50.674 --> 13:55.242
Odd behavior or, uh, strangers
coming by, anything like that?

13:58.180 --> 14:00.113
You're his partner?

14:00.115 --> 14:02.281
Yes, ma'am.

14:04.151 --> 14:07.719
He told me you
weighed 300 pounds.

14:13.926 --> 14:15.992
That's why I loved him.

14:17.328 --> 14:20.862
Even though I knew he'd never
lay a hand on another woman,

14:20.864 --> 14:23.030
Mark still wanted to make sure
I slept soundly.

14:23.032 --> 14:25.332
Mark was a gentleman,
mrs. Moore.

14:27.302 --> 14:30.169
Till he got himself
caught up in something.

14:30.171 --> 14:31.904
I knew it was bad.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.873
What did he tell you?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.074
He said there were
men following me

14:36.076 --> 14:37.408
But that nothing would happen.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.144
He told me he was gonna
take care of it.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.812
Talia:
Mark was brave.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.146
He's not the type of guy

14:43.148 --> 14:45.181
That you could just scare
into committing treason.

14:45.183 --> 14:49.418
In fact we believe that they
were using you as leverage.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.453
And the question is--
who are they?

14:52.289 --> 14:56.291
So, mr. Michaels,

14:56.293 --> 14:58.126
Not a big fan
of the hl-7 test?

14:58.128 --> 14:59.727
Kind of,
sort of over it?

14:59.729 --> 15:01.729
Hey, why don't you cut
me loose, all right?

15:01.731 --> 15:02.863
I'll get out of your hair.

15:02.865 --> 15:05.031
I think the hl-7's
a joke, personally.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.999
I mean, I'm not a hard-ass
special forces soldier

15:07.001 --> 15:08.367
Like yourself,

15:08.369 --> 15:11.103
But it's all new age
psychobabble if you ask me.

15:12.072 --> 15:15.139
Look, I've read
your file.

15:15.141 --> 15:17.474
You wanted this cia gig
pretty badly.

15:17.476 --> 15:20.143
You spent the past ten or so
years on the agency track,

15:20.145 --> 15:21.811
And it was all for nothing.

15:21.813 --> 15:24.480
Hey, I'll find
work, all right?

15:24.482 --> 15:26.482
But not the work you want.

15:26.484 --> 15:28.717
Not without
citadel-vetted clearance.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.785
It doesn't have to be that way.

15:34.157 --> 15:35.489
What are you saying?

15:35.491 --> 15:37.890
I'm saying you passed the test.

15:41.428 --> 15:43.094
You aced your hl-7.

15:43.096 --> 15:44.762
It's what I do.

15:44.764 --> 15:47.097
You scored well above
the top one percent

15:47.099 --> 15:50.900
In the areas of morality,
drive and leadership.

15:50.902 --> 15:53.502
I just wanted
to meet you in person.

15:53.504 --> 15:55.237
Well, I'm happy
to serve my country.

15:55.239 --> 15:58.240
Mind if I ask you
a question, dr. Rathburn?

15:58.242 --> 15:59.474
By all means.

15:59.476 --> 16:01.476
Coffee?

16:01.478 --> 16:02.810
No, thanks.

16:02.812 --> 16:05.746
What happens
to the guys who fail?

16:05.748 --> 16:08.081
They're processed and
escorted from the building

16:08.083 --> 16:11.084
Within ten minutes.

16:11.086 --> 16:13.219
Callen:<i> There's no way</i>
<i> I passed that test.</i>

16:13.221 --> 16:15.854
Well, yeah,
y-you tanked it,

16:15.856 --> 16:17.856
But I have the power to slide
you through the system anyway.

16:17.858 --> 16:19.390
Get you citadel-approved.

16:19.392 --> 16:22.292
And I don't have to tell you how
valuable those credentials are.

16:25.330 --> 16:26.996
In exchange for what?

16:26.998 --> 16:28.864
Nothing.

16:28.866 --> 16:31.133
Right now, that is.

16:31.134 --> 16:33.401
But one day, mr. Michaels,
I may come asking for a favor.

16:33.403 --> 16:36.237
Of course, there's
a chance I won't.

16:36.239 --> 16:37.905
It all depends
on what the powers that be

16:37.907 --> 16:39.406
Require at any given time.

16:44.946 --> 16:46.812
Sounds kind of dangerous.

16:46.814 --> 16:48.513
We're dangerous men.

16:48.515 --> 16:49.814
What's your name?

16:51.951 --> 16:54.017
Jon bennett.

16:58.256 --> 17:00.456
Would you like to see
how dangerous I am, mr. Bennett?

17:00.458 --> 17:01.790
Not the face, man.

17:01.792 --> 17:03.224
Not the face.

17:08.864 --> 17:11.197
(alarm sounds)
uh, fire alarm triggered,
25th floor.

17:11.199 --> 17:13.332
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:18.271 --> 17:20.271
Didn't think
there was a fire.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.474
Yeah, meet jon bennett, he's a
little sensitive about his face.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.842
Well, what, you figured

17:24.844 --> 17:26.494
There wasn't enough
time to arrest him?

17:26.495 --> 17:28.145
A lot of dea agents
may not have much time left.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.814
Bennett: You have no idea
what you just stepped into.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.148
We have people
everywhere.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.482
People you've
known for years,

17:33.484 --> 17:35.383
The ones you see
every day at work.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.918
You think you know
them, but you don't.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.886
How well do you
really know anyone?

17:39.888 --> 17:42.421
We're about to find out.

17:56.502 --> 17:58.568
Eric:
Citadel poached jon bennett

17:58.570 --> 18:01.103
From a wall street marketing
firm three years ago.

18:01.105 --> 18:02.170
Prep school,

18:02.172 --> 18:04.172
Wealthy family,
harvard degree.

18:04.174 --> 18:06.841
No military or law
enforcement experience.

18:06.843 --> 18:08.909
They needed
a deal maker,

18:08.911 --> 18:10.377
Someone slick and smart,
a wall street type

18:10.379 --> 18:12.245
That's willing to
overlook ethics

18:12.247 --> 18:13.512
In exchange for a paycheck.

18:13.514 --> 18:15.046
Those wall street types
aren't built

18:15.048 --> 18:16.514
To do life terms in prison.

18:16.516 --> 18:17.548
He'll talk.

18:17.550 --> 18:19.082
Thanks, guys.

18:19.084 --> 18:20.149
Yeah.
No problem.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.120
You good?

18:26.890 --> 18:28.222
Yeah.

18:28.224 --> 18:31.358
The hl-7 test
that citadel ran on us...

18:31.360 --> 18:33.026
Your plan worked, sam.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.328
You passed, I failed.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.395
It's as simple as that.

18:36.397 --> 18:37.929
That wasn't me.

18:37.931 --> 18:39.263
It was just an alias.

18:39.265 --> 18:40.931
Didn't rattle
you at all, huh?

18:40.933 --> 18:41.998
No.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.333
I didn't feel a thing.

18:44.335 --> 18:46.401
People see what
I want them to see.

18:51.908 --> 18:54.909
My boss, dr. Rathburn, is
probably wondering where I am.

18:54.911 --> 18:57.244
All she has to do is look
at the security camera footage

18:57.246 --> 18:58.979
During the fire alarm,
and she'll know.

18:58.981 --> 19:01.982
She may decide to mitigate the
risk and just have you killed.

19:01.984 --> 19:04.985
If I die,
you've got nothing.

19:04.987 --> 19:06.987
And if you live?

19:06.989 --> 19:08.955
Maybe you'll figure out
how citadel really works,

19:08.957 --> 19:10.623
Before rathburn starts
making phone calls.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.958
Hmm.
You should see
her speed-dial list.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.994
Senators, half the nsa,
the white house.

19:15.996 --> 19:18.363
She'll have the lights
in this place turned off

19:18.365 --> 19:19.497
By 5:00 p.M. Today.

19:19.499 --> 19:22.366
5:00.

19:22.368 --> 19:25.268
Well, I guess you'd better
start talking, then.

19:25.270 --> 19:26.435
Negotiation starts now.

19:26.437 --> 19:29.638
Supermax prison,
life sentence,

19:29.640 --> 19:31.640
Solitary confinement.

19:31.642 --> 19:33.575
(scoffs)

19:33.577 --> 19:35.243
I won't get solitary.

19:35.245 --> 19:39.313
You're not the only one who
knows how to make deals.

19:39.315 --> 19:44.350
Rest of your life in a box,
supermax, no visitors, no hope.

19:47.321 --> 19:49.187
That's not...

19:49.189 --> 19:51.656
Not what you're
prepared for?

19:55.995 --> 19:58.996
Negotiation starts now.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.064
No solitary confinement
for life.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.434
You give us citadel
on a platter,

20:05.436 --> 20:07.169
Maybe we'll talk
about that.

20:12.275 --> 20:14.141
There used to be two outcomes

20:14.143 --> 20:16.610
When citadel vetted you
for clearance-- pass or fail.

20:16.612 --> 20:21.147
Now there's three--
pass, fail and potential.

20:21.149 --> 20:22.381
Explain "potential."

20:24.218 --> 20:26.218
Dr. Rathburn developed
an algorithm

20:26.220 --> 20:29.221
That identifies a specific type
of personality.

20:29.223 --> 20:31.690
High in aggression,
low degrees of hesitation.

20:31.692 --> 20:33.692
A natural skepticism
towards authority figures.

20:33.694 --> 20:35.660
Opportunistic.

20:35.662 --> 20:37.662
The kind of candidate
that's not afraid to take risks,

20:37.664 --> 20:39.163
Maybe cut a side deal.

20:39.165 --> 20:42.199
Sam: So citadel gives them
credentials for work,

20:42.201 --> 20:45.368
Builds itself a network
of covert spies.

20:47.071 --> 20:50.072
It's like a... It's like
a shadow government.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.407
A state within a state.

20:52.409 --> 20:55.309
You were hired to handle the
candidates with potential.

20:55.311 --> 20:58.245
Candidates like
mark moore.

20:58.247 --> 20:59.379
Yes.

20:59.381 --> 21:01.247
Once a candidate
accepts a deal,

21:01.249 --> 21:03.382
We build an extensive file
on their family and friends.

21:04.651 --> 21:06.183
Leverage.

21:06.185 --> 21:11.021
These kind of candidates
aren't afraid to get killed.

21:11.023 --> 21:13.356
Got to keep them
motivated and loyal.

21:13.358 --> 21:15.257
Bennett: If they refuse
to do citadel's bidding,

21:15.259 --> 21:17.325
Their families get hurt.

21:17.327 --> 21:19.994
And if they try and go public,
they risk a prison sentence

21:19.996 --> 21:21.462
For accepting
top secret clearance

21:21.464 --> 21:23.163
After they failed the test.

21:23.165 --> 21:27.000
Once you take the deal,
there's no way out.

21:27.002 --> 21:29.568
That's what I've been
trying to tell you guys.

21:32.439 --> 21:35.573
How many government employees
does citadel control right now?

21:35.575 --> 21:39.310
Well, we've got hundreds
of people across every agency.

21:39.312 --> 21:43.447
Cia, fbi, dea,
atf, nsa.

21:43.449 --> 21:46.349
Maybe even ncis.

21:50.021 --> 21:51.754
I don't really
expect you to tell me,

21:51.756 --> 21:53.522
But what are you looking for?

21:53.524 --> 21:56.191
Mark uploaded some
very sensitive documents

21:56.193 --> 21:57.625
Onto an unauthorized
thumb drive.

21:57.627 --> 22:00.494
It's important that we find
it before somebody else does.

22:00.496 --> 22:02.496
What do you mean
by "sensitive"?

22:02.498 --> 22:04.764
Well, it contains the names
of hundreds of informants

22:04.766 --> 22:07.533
Placed in mexican drug cartels
over the last decade.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.101
That list gets
in the wrong hands,

22:09.103 --> 22:10.335
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

22:12.572 --> 22:15.239
A bloodbath that mark
was willing to risk

22:15.241 --> 22:17.341
Because he wanted
to protect me?

22:20.245 --> 22:22.245
I never would have let
him do it if I'd known.

22:22.247 --> 22:24.447
Which is why he never told you.

22:24.449 --> 22:26.782
All right, if we don't find
that thumb drive today,

22:26.784 --> 22:28.450
Your agency's gonna have to
start pulling people out.

22:28.452 --> 22:30.319
Do you know

22:30.320 --> 22:32.187
How many years it took
to place those informants?

22:32.189 --> 22:33.621
People sacrificed
their lives

22:33.623 --> 22:35.589
Just to get a chance
to help them inside.

22:35.591 --> 22:37.424
Kensi:
Yeah, a sacrifice that's
not gonna be worth it

22:37.426 --> 22:39.192
If their names
are exposed.

22:39.194 --> 22:41.160
Look, we don't even know if
the cartel has the thumb drive.

22:41.162 --> 22:42.278
Are you kidding
me right now?

22:42.279 --> 22:43.395
You try saying
that to the people

22:43.397 --> 22:44.462
Whose names are
actually on it, talia.

22:44.464 --> 22:48.132
Those are beautiful heels.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.500
I mean, I have

22:49.502 --> 22:51.268
The fashion sense
of a street urchin,

22:51.270 --> 22:53.169
But even I can tell that
those were made by a master.

22:53.171 --> 22:54.837
I mean,
those are beautiful heels.

22:54.839 --> 22:58.173
I couldn't believe
mark got them for me.

22:58.175 --> 23:00.675
I'd been dreaming about
a pair like this for months.

23:00.677 --> 23:02.476
He knew you pretty well.

23:04.112 --> 23:06.445
Mark joked I treated them
better than my prius.

23:06.447 --> 23:08.413
(laughs)
(laughs)

23:08.415 --> 23:10.081
They're beautiful.
Can I, can I see them

23:10.083 --> 23:11.082
For a second?

23:11.084 --> 23:12.650
Deeks...

23:12.652 --> 23:14.418
No, I'm pretty sure
he knows what he's doing.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.752
I certainly hope so,
'cause this whole

23:15.754 --> 23:17.754
Foot fetish routine
is freaking me out.

23:20.258 --> 23:22.625
I know it sounds creepy,
but... Just for a second.

23:26.597 --> 23:28.396
I know what it's like
to lose somebody.

23:30.466 --> 23:32.499
Crazy thing about it is
that after they're gone,

23:32.501 --> 23:34.167
It's like everything
that passed between you

23:34.169 --> 23:36.302
Seems like the most precious
thing in the world, you know?

23:36.304 --> 23:38.504
That's very true, detective.

23:38.506 --> 23:40.572
Now, we know that he loved you.

23:40.574 --> 23:43.841
And we know that he
was gonna protect you.

23:43.843 --> 23:46.410
And this thumb drive
we're looking for,

23:46.412 --> 23:48.445
He would never put it any place
you were gonna find it,

23:48.447 --> 23:49.997
Because finding it means

23:49.998 --> 23:51.548
That you're gonna become
a target, just like he was.

23:51.550 --> 23:54.117
And so, if you're him,
what do you do?

23:54.119 --> 23:57.687
He puts it in the one place
that you would never look.

23:58.189 --> 23:58.820
(clears throat)

24:02.492 --> 24:03.491
It's in there?

24:03.493 --> 24:04.492
Kensi:
Left shoe.

24:04.494 --> 24:05.759
The heel.

24:05.761 --> 24:06.893
Talia:
And that is why

24:06.895 --> 24:08.661
Your one shoe hurt
more than the other.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.300
May I?

24:25.545 --> 24:26.777
And there she is.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.145
Talia:
Wow.

24:28.147 --> 24:29.846
Gotta hand it to you, deeks.

24:29.848 --> 24:31.781
That's actually
impressive.

24:31.783 --> 24:32.848
You definitely have some sort of
weird foot fetish happening,

24:32.850 --> 24:35.450
But that's impressive.

24:35.452 --> 24:36.584
It's not a fetish--

24:36.586 --> 24:38.285
It's just a lifestyle.

24:38.287 --> 24:39.686
That was kensi.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.587
They recovered
the dea informant list.

24:41.589 --> 24:43.589
Eric ran a remote scan.

24:43.591 --> 24:45.641
Turns out that the thumb drives

24:45.642 --> 24:47.692
Were custom-encrypted
to prevent copying.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.495
Sounds like someone's prepping
intel for the black market.

24:50.497 --> 24:52.763
Is citadel the buyer
or the seller?

24:52.765 --> 24:54.565
The seller.

24:54.566 --> 24:56.366
The molina cartel offered
$100 million for the list.

24:57.769 --> 25:00.402
It all goes
back to money.

25:00.404 --> 25:01.470
Dr. Rathburn needs funding

25:01.471 --> 25:02.537
To keep
citadel assessment protocols

25:02.539 --> 25:03.704
Ahead of its competitors.

25:03.706 --> 25:05.405
But her social circle's the type

25:05.407 --> 25:06.706
That lives
on private jets and yachts.

25:06.708 --> 25:08.841
So she's using federal dollars

25:08.843 --> 25:10.475
To fund her lifestyle.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.643
Had to create some new scheme

25:12.645 --> 25:13.844
To keep citadel running.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.579
Makes you wonder
what she'd score

25:15.581 --> 25:17.347
On her own hl-7 test, right?

25:18.750 --> 25:19.882
Citadel has
a large enough network

25:19.884 --> 25:22.651
To stall any investigation.

25:22.653 --> 25:24.252
The moment we
leave this room,

25:24.254 --> 25:26.787
Make an official report,

25:26.789 --> 25:28.255
Someone at one agency
or another's gonna

25:28.257 --> 25:30.757
Warn dr. Rathburn
we're coming.

25:30.759 --> 25:33.826
If what he's
saying is true,

25:33.828 --> 25:35.494
Citadel has
compromised

25:35.496 --> 25:37.562
Hundreds of federal
law enforcement agents.

25:37.564 --> 25:40.631
They're at rathburn's
beck and call.

25:40.633 --> 25:42.299
There's not going to be
an official report.

25:42.301 --> 25:44.701
We can't risk the leak.

25:44.703 --> 25:45.935
Exactly.

25:45.937 --> 25:48.637
Taking down citadel's
gonna be on us.

25:48.639 --> 25:50.505
Bennett:
You're crazy.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.407
Think about what happens
if you take a swing and miss.

25:53.409 --> 25:55.675
The white house will have
your team broken up by dawn

25:55.677 --> 25:57.376
And rathburn's kill squads
will hunt you down

25:57.378 --> 25:58.777
For as long as it takes.

26:00.947 --> 26:02.880
Citadel will never stop coming.

26:02.882 --> 26:05.549
Neither will we.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.259
Bennett just
signed his deal.

26:17.261 --> 26:18.660
He's going to help
us take down citadel

26:18.662 --> 26:20.261
In exchange for
a reduced sentence.

26:20.263 --> 26:21.729
Citadel knows that

26:21.731 --> 26:23.997
That dea informant list
is still out there.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.982
From what bennett tells us,

26:25.983 --> 26:27.966
Their ceo is desperate to get
the molina cartel's cash.

26:27.969 --> 26:30.336
Sam:
$100 million
on the line.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.705
So we're setting up a sting.

26:32.707 --> 26:33.972
Dr. Rathburn's
been wondering

26:33.974 --> 26:35.773
Why bennett vanished
at that fire alarm.

26:35.775 --> 26:38.375
He's gonna call her,
explain the reason.

26:38.377 --> 26:39.676
Callen:
He was approached by people

26:39.678 --> 26:42.412
Who can deliver
the missing dea informant list.

26:42.414 --> 26:43.946
But rathburn is smart.

26:43.948 --> 26:46.782
Smart enough to suspect
that she's being set up.

26:46.784 --> 26:48.383
She's also confident enough
to think she can outmaneuver

26:48.385 --> 26:49.717
Whatever bennett's
gotten himself into

26:49.719 --> 26:51.485
And get what she's
wanted from the start.

26:51.487 --> 26:52.853
At least we hope so.

26:52.855 --> 26:53.987
Right.
Sam:
Now, g and I were seen

26:53.989 --> 26:55.421
On a citadel security cam today,

26:55.423 --> 26:57.523
So if we show up and
we're recognized,

26:57.525 --> 26:59.291
The whole op
could fall apart.

26:59.293 --> 27:00.992
Rathburn would realize
someone's onto her

27:00.994 --> 27:03.527
And the dea list won't be good
as bait anymore.

27:03.529 --> 27:04.594
Callen:
With her political
connections,

27:04.596 --> 27:05.928
There's a very
strong possibility

27:05.930 --> 27:06.995
We won't get another
chance at her.

27:06.997 --> 27:08.830
All right.

27:08.832 --> 27:10.598
So bennett lures
her to the scene

27:10.600 --> 27:11.999
With the dea list.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.399
Deeks and I show up
with the thumb drive.

27:13.402 --> 27:14.768
We're just a couple
of rogue agents

27:14.770 --> 27:15.769
Trying to make
a quick buck

27:15.771 --> 27:18.037
By selling it back to citadel.

27:18.039 --> 27:19.371
Once we make the sale,

27:19.373 --> 27:21.373
You and sam show up,
bust her,

27:21.375 --> 27:22.874
Game over.
Talia:
Close.

27:22.876 --> 27:23.774
No cigar.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.544
Yeah, I'm not going
undercover with you.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.545
I'm going with talia.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.230
What?

27:30.231 --> 27:31.914
Citadel knows
she busted her partner

27:31.917 --> 27:33.617
Trying to steal the dea list.

27:33.618 --> 27:35.318
She was supposed to die
in the interrogation room,

27:35.320 --> 27:37.953
But she escaped,
so citadel has no idea

27:37.955 --> 27:39.821
How much she does
or does not know.

27:39.823 --> 27:41.756
They already sent a hit team
to the safe house

27:41.758 --> 27:43.324
To try and take her
out this morning.

27:43.326 --> 27:45.326
Yeah.
Sam:
Kensi...

27:45.328 --> 27:48.529
Rathburn's worried she'll find
agent moore's thumb drive,

27:48.531 --> 27:50.764
Blow that $100 million payday.

27:50.766 --> 27:53.600
Callen:
Talia will make
the sale to rathburn.

27:53.602 --> 27:55.568
Deeks will go in as a
corrupt cop backing her up.

27:55.570 --> 27:57.336
While I'm stuck
in overwatch.

27:57.338 --> 27:59.304
Sam:
Which is exactly
where we need you.

27:59.306 --> 28:00.905
Dr. Rathburn's savvy enough

28:00.907 --> 28:02.573
To have her own sniper out there
in case things go wrong.

28:02.575 --> 28:04.641
Deeks:
Yeah, you're calling
it "overwatch,"

28:04.643 --> 28:06.809
I'm calling it
"keeping marty alive."

28:06.811 --> 28:08.911
Okay.

28:08.913 --> 28:11.480
You know, citadel is
a national security risk

28:11.482 --> 28:13.915
That affects every law
enforcement agency in america.

28:13.917 --> 28:15.049
Hundreds of people
are being blackmailed.

28:15.051 --> 28:18.485
We need to take down
dr. Rathburn today.

28:18.487 --> 28:21.488
This is gonna be our only shot.

28:28.029 --> 28:30.662
If you're here to make a speech,
I'm not interested.

28:32.599 --> 28:33.965
Just checking
on you.

28:35.635 --> 28:37.101
All right.

28:37.103 --> 28:39.369
Make yourself useful.

28:44.842 --> 28:46.408
Kensi, are you
a perfectionist?

28:48.612 --> 28:50.044
About certain things.

28:50.046 --> 28:51.578
Such as...?

28:53.582 --> 28:57.483
Guns, knives,
and... Dating.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.384
I like your
priorities.
Mmm.

29:02.789 --> 29:04.455
You're the ultimate
perfectionist.

29:06.058 --> 29:07.524
According to some.

29:07.526 --> 29:09.058
How do you do it?

29:11.829 --> 29:12.828
Getting things perfect,

29:12.830 --> 29:14.629
It just weighs me down.

29:14.631 --> 29:17.732
It stresses me out,
and worst of all,

29:17.734 --> 29:19.433
I know it shows.

29:19.435 --> 29:20.867
You get results.

29:22.837 --> 29:25.437
I make the people I care about
unhappy in the process.

29:25.439 --> 29:26.504
Nobody's perfect.

29:29.375 --> 29:31.408
But the pursuit of
perfection is all about

29:31.410 --> 29:34.544
Problems and solutions.

29:34.546 --> 29:35.745
You're not good
at something,

29:35.747 --> 29:37.446
You practice more.

29:37.448 --> 29:39.148
You're broke?

29:39.149 --> 29:40.849
You work harder,
spend less, save more.

29:40.851 --> 29:44.085
You have a relationship
that drives you crazy?

29:46.155 --> 29:48.889
Seek first to understand,
then be understood.

29:48.891 --> 29:50.707
(sighs)

29:50.708 --> 29:52.524
Man, you make it sound so much
easier than it actually is.

29:52.527 --> 29:53.893
It's not.

29:53.895 --> 29:56.896
It's probably the hardest way
someone can live, but...

29:56.898 --> 29:59.398
Anything worth doing
is worth doing right.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.466
Yeah, but every time
you solve a problem,

30:01.468 --> 30:03.134
You know that there's just more
coming your way.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.668
You never get to enjoy life.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.404
I haven't solved
a problem in years.

30:07.406 --> 30:10.073
How so?
Well...

30:10.075 --> 30:13.176
Anytime I feel like a
problem's about to appear,

30:13.178 --> 30:14.810
I just keep looking at the world

30:14.812 --> 30:16.578
And then, uh,

30:16.580 --> 30:18.880
I realize that the only time
problems appear

30:18.882 --> 30:20.448
Is when I'm running around,

30:20.450 --> 30:21.849
Trying to find a solution.

30:23.819 --> 30:25.852
I never thought
about it that way.

30:25.854 --> 30:27.520
You can't force it.

30:27.522 --> 30:30.189
Gotta let it flow.

30:30.191 --> 30:32.858
More being, less doing.

30:35.095 --> 30:37.862
"more being, less doing."

30:37.864 --> 30:38.929
Huh.

30:41.033 --> 30:42.432
Might have to just steal
that one from you.

30:42.434 --> 30:44.434
Nah, you don't have to steal it.

30:44.436 --> 30:46.469
I'll let you have it.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.537
More being, less doing.

31:00.183 --> 31:01.782
You good?

31:01.784 --> 31:02.849
Yeah, no,
I'm good.

31:05.787 --> 31:06.786
Dr. Rathburn
didn't become

31:06.788 --> 31:09.488
Ceo of citadel for nothing.

31:09.490 --> 31:12.524
She's a genius when it comes
to analyzing behavior.

31:12.526 --> 31:14.192
Micro-expressions,

31:14.194 --> 31:16.127
Posture,

31:16.129 --> 31:17.862
The words you use...

31:19.699 --> 31:21.231
You worried I'm gonna
blow this op?

31:22.901 --> 31:24.600
I guess I'm just looking out.

31:25.669 --> 31:27.769
The things we think
aren't such a big deal

31:27.771 --> 31:29.771
May be a really
big deal to others.

31:29.773 --> 31:30.772
Yeah, no, I get that.

31:32.075 --> 31:33.140
Do you?

31:35.777 --> 31:37.810
I mean, I get citadel's
gonna have shooters everywhere

31:37.812 --> 31:39.778
And one clumsy lie

31:39.780 --> 31:41.679
Means someone's
gonna get killed.

31:44.784 --> 31:46.049
You're talking about kensi.

31:47.485 --> 31:49.985
I'm talking about all of us
being on our game.

31:51.955 --> 31:53.621
Whatever's going on
in our personal lives

31:53.623 --> 31:55.522
Gets buried
so that we can be in the moment.

31:55.524 --> 31:57.056
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

31:57.058 --> 31:58.690
I'll be in the moment.

31:59.659 --> 32:00.724
Good.

32:04.129 --> 32:05.895
Let's hope your partner is, too.

32:10.034 --> 32:12.100
(indistinct chatter)

32:18.107 --> 32:19.873
Deeks (over earwig):
We're approaching
the rendezvous point.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.574
Copy.

32:21.576 --> 32:23.275
Eric:
I have eyes on deeks,

32:23.277 --> 32:24.843
Talia and bennett.

32:24.845 --> 32:27.011
Clear copy.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.747
Got a good visual.

32:29.749 --> 32:30.981
Got four possible shooters
in the crowd.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.215
Caucasian, male,

32:32.217 --> 32:33.950
Wraparound sunglasses
and cover shirts.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.052
Callen:
Copy that.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.286
I got them.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.887
Deeks:
You good, bennett?

32:39.823 --> 32:41.689
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

32:41.691 --> 32:43.657
I'm sorry,
did you just call me "bro"?

32:43.659 --> 32:45.425
Talia:
Okay.

32:45.426 --> 32:47.192
Gordon gekko jr. Over here
is most certainly not good.

32:47.195 --> 32:48.894
He is sweating
through his suit, deeks.

32:48.896 --> 32:50.829
I excel under pressure.

32:50.831 --> 32:52.797
Yeah, sam and callen
kidnapped you

32:52.799 --> 32:54.215
And turned you
against your boss

32:54.216 --> 32:55.632
In the same time it
takes me to eat lunch.

32:55.635 --> 32:56.800
You are certainly
not good, bro.

32:56.802 --> 32:58.201
Whoa.
Hmm?

32:58.203 --> 32:59.735
(clears his throat)

32:59.737 --> 33:01.770
What... What are you doing?

33:01.772 --> 33:04.038
Oh, this is
our cover story, deeks.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.773
No, our cover story is that
you're a rogue dea agent

33:05.775 --> 33:08.776
And I'm a dirty cop looking to
cash in on murder and mayhem.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.810
Mm-hmm.

33:09.812 --> 33:11.711
Why are you
holding my hand?

33:11.713 --> 33:13.713
Because we're in love.
Are we?

33:13.715 --> 33:15.848
Mm-hmm, you're
gonna use that money

33:15.850 --> 33:17.149
To take me surfing in bali
when your other

33:17.151 --> 33:19.251
Work affair
least suspects it.

33:19.253 --> 33:21.119
Please let go
of my hand.

33:21.121 --> 33:22.987
You know, at this point
it might seem suspicious.

33:22.989 --> 33:24.288
You know, like we're
in a fight or something.

33:24.290 --> 33:25.756
That's because we are
in a fight or something.

33:25.758 --> 33:28.825
Who holds hands
on a sting operation?

33:28.827 --> 33:30.593
Both:
We do.

33:30.595 --> 33:33.996
Dr. Rathburn has to know
something's up.

33:33.998 --> 33:36.832
She's only coming here today
to confirm her suspicions.

33:36.834 --> 33:39.134
I'm dead.
Bennett,

33:39.136 --> 33:40.735
It's gonna be fine--
just breathe.

33:40.737 --> 33:43.270
Speak for yourself,
lover boy.
Deeks?

33:43.272 --> 33:45.605
Why is your hand
so sweaty?

33:45.607 --> 33:48.341
Is everything at home okay
with you and the princess?

33:48.343 --> 33:51.243
Deeks: Oh, god, wow, I do not
remember you being this cruel.

33:51.245 --> 33:54.679
You missed it.

33:54.681 --> 33:56.013
Do I?
Mm-hmm.

33:56.015 --> 33:57.347
Kensi:
And the princess

33:57.349 --> 33:59.582
Can hear everything
you're saying

33:59.584 --> 34:01.183
And has the ability
to shoot high-velocity rounds

34:01.185 --> 34:03.785
In your direction
at 3,000 feet per second.

34:03.787 --> 34:04.752
Good looking out, baby.

34:04.754 --> 34:05.986
Talia:
Yeah, sweetheart.

34:05.988 --> 34:08.188
Both of you, shut up.

34:08.190 --> 34:10.023
All right, kids,
look alive.

34:10.025 --> 34:11.791
We got a visual
on dr. Rathburn.

34:11.793 --> 34:13.859
She's approaching
the rendezvous point on foot,

34:13.861 --> 34:15.227
50 yards out.

34:15.229 --> 34:17.762
And it looks like she's alone.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.897
We're scanning
park camera footage now,

34:19.899 --> 34:23.000
But we're only tracking
those four men on the ground.

34:23.002 --> 34:25.969
Rathburn's got to have
a sniper out there someplace.

34:25.971 --> 34:27.637
Find him.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.805
Deeks:
My three o'clock.

34:29.807 --> 34:31.873
Game on.

34:31.875 --> 34:34.809
I was wondering where you'd
run off to today, mr. Bennett.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.294
As I said on the phone,

34:36.295 --> 34:37.778
Agent talia del campo
approached me with an offer.

34:37.780 --> 34:39.112
I wouldn't waste your time.

34:39.114 --> 34:42.115
I looked up
your citadel file, talia.

34:42.117 --> 34:44.717
Your hl-7 results

34:44.719 --> 34:46.185
Told me there was
a less than one percent chance

34:46.187 --> 34:48.287
You'd betray the dea,

34:48.289 --> 34:50.856
And if you did,
it would be for love.

34:50.858 --> 34:54.926
I guess you nailed me,
dr. Rathburn.

34:54.928 --> 34:58.663
You weren't much of a surprise,
either, detective deeks.

34:58.665 --> 35:00.731
The hl-7 predicted you'd

35:00.733 --> 35:02.299
Turn on the lapd eventually.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.200
Authority issues,

35:04.202 --> 35:06.835
Your talent for manipulation,

35:06.837 --> 35:08.303
A fixation for revenge

35:08.305 --> 35:09.671
For that one time...

35:09.673 --> 35:11.339
Are we gonna do this or not?

35:11.341 --> 35:13.674
Mr. Bennett's
a creature of habit

35:13.676 --> 35:15.709
Who would only go dark on me

35:15.711 --> 35:17.210
If faced with something
far more severe

35:17.212 --> 35:19.645
Than a standard
prison sentence.

35:19.647 --> 35:20.979
You probably threatened him

35:20.981 --> 35:22.647
With life in solitary.

35:22.649 --> 35:24.115
So, no...

35:24.117 --> 35:25.649
We're not.
(gunshot)

35:25.651 --> 35:28.151
Deeks:
Sniper!

35:28.153 --> 35:29.886
(crowd clamoring)

35:29.888 --> 35:32.722
Damn it! Bennett's down,
rathburn's on the move!

35:32.724 --> 35:34.990
Take out that sniper now!

35:34.992 --> 35:36.858
Eric! Kensi!

35:36.860 --> 35:39.227
Scanning camera feeds;
can't find him anywhere.

35:39.229 --> 35:42.296
Just stay down.
I don't have him.

35:42.298 --> 35:43.997
Deeks, you got a visual
on rathburn?

35:43.999 --> 35:44.998
She's gone.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.066
Rathburn's gone.

35:47.168 --> 35:49.101
(gunfire)

36:01.080 --> 36:02.779
(gunfire)

36:02.781 --> 36:04.347
We're pinned down, kensi.

36:04.349 --> 36:06.716
You need to find that sniper!

36:06.718 --> 36:09.218
(gunshot)

36:09.220 --> 36:11.153
(deep breath)

36:11.155 --> 36:14.990
Dr. Rathburn just got in
an unmarked lincoln town car

36:14.992 --> 36:16.825
At the northern edge
of the park.

36:16.827 --> 36:18.793
And we got her tagged.

36:19.796 --> 36:21.862
(line ringing)

36:24.766 --> 36:26.298
Deeks:
Callen, sam,
shooters on the ground

36:26.300 --> 36:28.033
About to have you flanked
in 30 seconds!

36:28.035 --> 36:30.802
(gunshots)

36:30.804 --> 36:32.203
Come on!

36:32.205 --> 36:34.371
More being, less doing.

36:34.373 --> 36:36.439
(gunshots)

36:46.750 --> 36:48.316
Sniper's down.

36:48.317 --> 36:49.883
I repeat-- sniper's down.

37:02.765 --> 37:03.964
Bennett?

37:03.966 --> 37:06.299
It's over?

37:06.301 --> 37:09.035
Yeah.

37:09.037 --> 37:11.437
(groans)

37:11.439 --> 37:14.473
(sirens wailing in the distance)

37:19.980 --> 37:22.080
I made so many mistakes.

37:22.082 --> 37:24.749
Well...

37:24.751 --> 37:27.184
Maybe today will be
a new start for you.

37:29.388 --> 37:31.454
Did you get dr. Rathburn?

37:39.530 --> 37:40.829
Man:
Yes, ma'am?

37:40.831 --> 37:41.863
Gary?
Yes, ma'am.

37:41.865 --> 37:42.864
Get me the vice president,

37:42.866 --> 37:43.865
The attorney general,

37:43.867 --> 37:44.899
And secnav in that order.

37:44.901 --> 37:45.933
(dial tone drones)

37:45.935 --> 37:47.834
Gary?

37:47.836 --> 37:49.135
Hello?

37:51.105 --> 37:52.537
Hetty:
You're not the only one

37:52.539 --> 37:56.040
With friends in high places,

37:56.042 --> 37:58.842
Dr. Rathburn.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.413
Wow!

38:04.415 --> 38:06.948
You look very familiar.

38:06.950 --> 38:09.483
Ah, yes!

38:09.485 --> 38:12.385
I believe I have
a file on you, my dear.

38:12.387 --> 38:14.553
Your hl-7 results

38:14.555 --> 38:16.121
Were most revealing.

38:16.123 --> 38:18.823
Not the kind of thing
you'd want made public.

38:18.825 --> 38:20.825
Oh.

38:20.827 --> 38:23.828
I've never been
very interested in taking tests.

38:23.830 --> 38:25.996
Spoken like someone
who fails them.

38:25.998 --> 38:27.931
(laughs)

38:27.933 --> 38:31.868
Well, you may have evaluated
a woman who looked like me

38:31.870 --> 38:35.872
And sounded like me,
but it wasn't me at all.

38:35.874 --> 38:37.807
Then who was it?

38:37.809 --> 38:40.576
Oh, whoever I felt
like being that day.

38:40.578 --> 38:43.178
Your results were
validated by biometrics.

38:43.180 --> 38:46.948
It's impossible to outsmart
the hl-7 protocol.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.416
It's interesting,

38:48.418 --> 38:50.851
You administering
that silly test

38:50.853 --> 38:53.220
All these years,
never bothering

38:53.222 --> 38:56.489
To ask what the "hl"

38:56.491 --> 38:58.924
Stood for.

38:58.926 --> 39:01.593
It's the inventor's
initials, henry...
Etta.

39:01.595 --> 39:05.396
Henrietta lange.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.334
Pleasure to meet you.

39:11.870 --> 39:14.237
I'm afraid
our next conversation

39:14.239 --> 39:16.572
Won't be nearly as cordial.

39:16.574 --> 39:18.240
(door opens)

39:26.015 --> 39:28.081
(indistinct chatter)

39:30.552 --> 39:32.618
It was a pleasure
as usual.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.052
You know,
I think we work better

39:34.054 --> 39:36.020
When it's not a pleasure,
don't you?

39:36.022 --> 39:37.287
Mm-hmm.
(deep breath)

39:37.289 --> 39:39.088
More being, less doing.

39:39.090 --> 39:40.222
What?

39:40.224 --> 39:41.489
What is that?

39:41.491 --> 39:42.924
Nothing.

39:42.925 --> 39:44.358
I think your girlfriend
takes this jedi crap

39:44.360 --> 39:45.993
Way too seriously, marty.

39:45.994 --> 39:47.627
It's not jedi crap.
Although
I got to hand it her.

39:47.629 --> 39:49.862
She made one hell
of a shot today.

39:49.864 --> 39:52.965
Oh, well, thank you, but you
can compliment me to my face.

39:52.967 --> 39:54.633
She's good.
She's the best.

39:54.635 --> 39:56.468
She is.
Still standing right here.

39:56.470 --> 39:58.870
Actually, do you mind telling
her, when I take off,

39:58.872 --> 40:01.239
It was really good
to see her?
I can do that.

40:01.241 --> 40:02.873
That's very sweet.

40:02.875 --> 40:04.608
You know, I think that
deserves a proper thank you.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.910
It's very gentlemanly of you.

40:06.912 --> 40:07.911
What are you doing?

40:07.913 --> 40:09.045
Nothing.

40:09.047 --> 40:10.646
Probably that... Aah!
Don't fight it.

40:10.648 --> 40:12.547
Okay!

40:12.549 --> 40:14.081
All right, that... Yeah!
(smacks)

40:14.083 --> 40:17.084
That just happened.
(clears throat)

40:17.086 --> 40:20.153
Classy.

40:20.155 --> 40:21.921
Somebody call human resources!

40:21.923 --> 40:24.156
(deep breath)

40:24.158 --> 40:25.991
Dinner?

40:25.993 --> 40:27.192
Yeah, no,
we should definitely

40:27.194 --> 40:29.894
Do that thing
where we eat dinner...
Good.

40:29.896 --> 40:31.262
Because I have reservations
at giorgio's for two.

40:31.264 --> 40:32.363
(phone chimes)

40:32.365 --> 40:35.032
And it is...
Truffle season?

40:35.034 --> 40:37.100
Um, yeah, no, giorgio's

40:37.102 --> 40:39.936
And truffles sounds...

40:39.938 --> 40:41.037
I got a better idea.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.005
Okay.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.940
Trust me?

40:44.942 --> 40:46.141
Uh...
Come on.

40:48.578 --> 40:50.377
I never liked tests.

40:50.379 --> 40:51.644
It's 'cause you think
of them as tests.

40:51.646 --> 40:54.213
As opposed to?
Opportunities.

40:54.215 --> 40:56.582
Opportunities to keep your
perfect streak alive, uh-huh.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.183
Can't argue with success, g.

40:58.185 --> 40:59.684
Success?

40:59.686 --> 41:01.102
Streak ended today.

41:01.103 --> 41:02.519
First of all,
it was a pop quiz.

41:02.522 --> 41:04.188
And second of all, I know you
thought of the number nine.

41:04.190 --> 41:05.489
I never confirmed it.

41:05.491 --> 41:07.123
Look me in the eye.

41:07.125 --> 41:08.924
Tell me you didn't
think of the number nine.

41:08.926 --> 41:10.692
It was either six or nine.

41:10.694 --> 41:11.927
You said only one number.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.161
You picked nine
before I could commit.

41:13.163 --> 41:14.262
Six and nine are very similar.

41:14.264 --> 41:15.596
That's the thing
about these tests.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.164
They're very subjective.

41:17.166 --> 41:18.265
Not this kind of test.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.566
Sam, I'm sorry
about the streak.

41:19.568 --> 41:20.934
Oh, the streak is alive!

41:20.936 --> 41:22.635
Mm-hmm.
Hetty:
Congratulations,

41:22.637 --> 41:24.970
You two, on a job well done.

41:24.972 --> 41:25.503
Thank you.

41:25.505 --> 41:26.971
What is this?

41:26.973 --> 41:28.038
That's for you.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.239
Oh!

41:29.241 --> 41:31.541
What about me?

41:31.543 --> 41:33.009
You don't need one.

41:33.644 --> 41:35.710
(sam and hetty laugh)

41:39.482 --> 41:41.048
I expect you to use that.

41:41.050 --> 41:42.682
Or I will.

41:42.684 --> 41:44.150
(laughs)

41:44.152 --> 41:46.485
Thank you.

41:46.487 --> 41:49.487
Uh-huh.

41:53.192 --> 41:54.742
So, while truffles
are obviously a delicacy,

41:54.743 --> 41:56.293
You never asked me
what my favorite meal was.

41:56.295 --> 41:58.228
Also, I have
a confession to make.

41:58.230 --> 42:00.730
There was no leak
and therefore no plumbers.

42:00.732 --> 42:03.165
Then why do you
still look nervous?

42:03.167 --> 42:06.301
Well, you're
about to find out.

42:06.303 --> 42:09.203
Oh...
(chuckles)

42:09.205 --> 42:12.005
Your favorite meal is
lasagna-- that's cute.

42:12.007 --> 42:15.108
Well, more specifically
my favorite meal is, uh,

42:15.110 --> 42:18.177
My mom's lasagna.

42:20.181 --> 42:22.548
Oh, my gosh.

42:22.550 --> 42:25.150
Your mom got here two days ago
and she's been staying with you.

42:25.152 --> 42:27.285
And she's the one who's been
blowing up your phone.

42:27.287 --> 42:29.153
And I know, I know
you're not making me

42:29.155 --> 42:30.554
Meet her for the first time...

42:30.556 --> 42:32.255
(arguing over each other)

42:32.257 --> 42:33.556
Is that you, martin?
Mama.

42:33.558 --> 42:35.057
Hey.
Hi, martin.

42:35.059 --> 42:37.025
Mom...

42:37.027 --> 42:39.127
This is, uh, kensi.

42:39.129 --> 42:41.729
Kensi, this is... My mom.

42:41.731 --> 42:44.098
And those are words
that I just said out loud.

42:44.100 --> 42:47.034
Hi, it is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

42:47.036 --> 42:48.235
You cook?

42:48.237 --> 42:49.269
No.

42:49.271 --> 42:50.737
You want to learn?
No.

42:53.641 --> 42:56.608
I like her.
Yeah, I like her, too.

42:56.610 --> 43:03.314
Come on,
let's get this party started.
I never liked truffles anyway.
