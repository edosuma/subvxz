I'm not taking
any more chances, OK?

15:24.215 --> 15:27.468
These species, they don't exist
anywhere else. This is it.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.388
This is the only place,
and now I'm even doubting

15:30.471 --> 15:33.891
if they're gonna survive
if I take them out of this room.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.519

15:36.602 --> 15:39.063

15:41.983 --> 15:44.527

To study. To learn.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.197

What?! No!
They'll take everything!

17:18.120 --> 17:20.414
<i>Merian, it's the government.</i>

17:20.498 --> 17:23.584

A terrorist.
You want me to be a terrorist?

You come in here,

You don't need

You seem to be fine
without one.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.067
You got a cell phone?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.568
Yeah.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.823
I'm gonna take that

19:58.906 --> 20:00.032
What else?

20:00.116 --> 20:03.202
Um, I thought
you might be thirsty.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.581
I'm surviving on bark
just fine.

20:07.665 --> 20:08.874
Huh.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.253
How do I know
it's not poisonous?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.088
You don't.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.298
Forget it, I was just‐‐

20:16.382 --> 20:17.383
I'll take it.

Take off your clothes.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.013
‐ Say what?
‐ I said take off your clothes.

20:23.097 --> 20:27.059
I need to make sure
you're not carrying
any weapons or explosives.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.561
( clears throat )

20:35.693 --> 20:37.319
Wow.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.281
So, Dr. Hill,
what's your spiel?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.825
‐ Call me Eugene.
‐ OK, Eugene.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.621
‐ <i>Dr.</i> Eugene.
‐ Dr. Merian.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.248
( laughs )

20:51.125 --> 20:53.878
I can understand
why you're fighting for this.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.922
This is truly astounding.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.800
I want to help this survive.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.387
But we have to work with them.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.222
"Them" will destroy it.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.682
We don't know that.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.268
If we can prove to them

21:09.351 --> 21:11.562
the enormity of what this is,

21:11.645 --> 21:14.231
and that this will not
be a threat,

21:14.315 --> 21:15.816
I think we can save this.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.319
Do you even know
what "this" is?

21:18.402 --> 21:19.945
Do <i>you?</i>

21:20.029 --> 21:23.657
What I know is that
this environment

21:23.741 --> 21:25.910
is recycling itself,

21:25.993 --> 21:30.164
that these leaves
are fortifying the fungi,
providing nutrients,

21:30.247 --> 21:34.794
and the fungi are thereby
fueling an entire species
of ancient ants

21:34.877 --> 21:38.923
who then spread the fungi
underneath the bed
where there is no sunlight.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.635
I know that the larvae of
an unknown beetle‐like colony

21:42.718 --> 21:46.764
is adapting into
its own subspecies
in the closet region.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.684
The walking‐fish
is pooping out
the only nutrients

21:50.768 --> 21:54.563
that is keeping
a long‐extinct
form of lily

21:54.647 --> 21:56.982
flourishing in the toilet.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.611
Growth is all around us.

22:00.694 --> 22:04.615
Adaptation and codependence.

22:04.698 --> 22:08.369
This environment
is self‐sufficient‐‐

22:08.452 --> 22:09.954
and efficient.

22:10.037 --> 22:13.499
I've even seen entire species
killed off in one day

22:13.582 --> 22:15.918
because of
its own natural selection.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.672
Well, then maybe
not all of this
is meant to survive.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.216
But who are we
to decide that?

22:22.299 --> 22:26.345
Look, before we came here,
forests covered most
of this earth,

22:26.428 --> 22:27.638
just like this!

22:27.721 --> 22:29.598
‐ The primordial jungle.
‐ Exactly.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.643
But this is but a snippet
of that abundance,

22:32.726 --> 22:36.438
a window into our past,
and a giant landscape

22:36.522 --> 22:38.983
of possibility
for our future.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.736
Look, I don't think
that all hope is lost here.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.656
I just think
we need an opportunity
to understand this.

22:45.739 --> 22:50.411
And can you really say
that you know what this is,
and that this is safe?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.415
No, I can't tell you that.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.041
Yes.

22:56.125 --> 23:00.921
So why not let us
study it and protect it?

23:02.047 --> 23:03.257
( sighs )

23:05.551 --> 23:07.553
So what now?

23:07.636 --> 23:09.597
You let 'em in.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.683
Let me fight with you.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.561
Let's prove to them
that this is not a threat,

23:15.644 --> 23:19.148
and then maybe
we can create a space

23:19.231 --> 23:22.693
where these ancient species
can survive,

23:22.776 --> 23:26.614
and allow for this to be larger
than just this room.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.500
( sighs ) Just don't
touch anything.
