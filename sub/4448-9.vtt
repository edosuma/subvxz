10:46.271 --> 10:48.732
DO NOT BE AFRAID
TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.443
NO ONE CAN TAKE FROM YOU
WHAT IS YOURS,

10:51.485 --> 10:54.821
IF YOU DEFEND IT LIKE A MAN!

10:56.615 --> 10:58.867
SHOW THEM THE BASICS.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.496
THEN SEND THEM OUT.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.331
‐ YO, IT'S EASY FOR HIM
NOT TO BE AFRAID.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.832
HE STAYS IN THE SAFE HOUSE.

11:05.874 --> 11:06.958
‐ IT'S MESSED UP,
WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMAL

11:07.000 --> 11:08.293
ON THE CORNER THE OTHER DAY.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.545
BUT THE LAST THING BELLO WANTS
IS MORE BLOODSHED.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.088
‐ SO THAT'S WHY
WE'RE GETTING BIGGER GUNS?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.132
‐ IT'S CALLED "DETERRENCE."

11:24.059 --> 11:26.895
[cartridge clacking]

11:30.357 --> 11:32.108
HEY, BRIGGS!
‐ YO.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.109
‐ PLEASE TELL ME
THERE'S SOME HOPEFUL NEWS

11:33.193 --> 11:34.402
ON THE JANGLES FRONT.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.904
‐ I WISH.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.739
I STILL DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW
WHAT THE GUY LOOKS LIKE.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.199
YOU KNOW?
‐ HMM.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.284
‐ EVERY TIME I SAW HIM,
HE HAD A BANDANA ON HIS FACE.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.870
COURSE, HE ALWAYS HAD
THOSE DAMN RATTLING KEYS.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.373
BUT, UH, YEAH,
IT'S STILL ALL I GOT TO GO ON.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.749
‐ WHY? BELLO'S
GETTING NERVOUS, HUH?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.584
‐ HE'S BRINGING IN SOME
INTENSE WEAPONRY FOR HIS BOYS.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.586
AND, UH, GUESS WHO GETS
TO TRAIN 'EM?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.129
‐ WELL, YOU KNOW,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.257
THE NIGERIAN COWBOY'S
NEVER BEEN ONE TO GO HALFWAY.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.675
‐ [scoffs] YEAH, MEANWHILE,
ON THE STREET,

11:56.758 --> 11:57.801
THERE'S GUYS WITH MACHETES...
[gun clacks]

11:57.842 --> 11:59.302
AND ASSAULT RIFLES.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.679
‐ YEAH, YOU JUST GOT TO HANG
IN THERE, YOU KNOW.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.930
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M DONE HANGING IN THERE.

12:02.013 --> 12:02.847
BULLETS ARE
GONNA START FLYING,

12:02.931 --> 12:04.224
AND I TRAINED THESE GUYS.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.518
I'M GOING TO THE FBI,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.228
AND I'M TELLING THEM WE HAVE
MORE THAN ENOUGH ON BELLO.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.063
IT'S TIME TO MOVE IN.
‐ NO, YOU'RE NOT.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.481
NOT YET.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.067
KEEPING BELLO IN PLAY
GETS US CLOSER TO JANGLES.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.903
both: AND ODIN.
‐ THAT'S RIGHT.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.239
YOU KNOW, MIKE, SOMETIMES IT'S
ALL ABOUT USING ONE MONSTER

12:19.281 --> 12:20.782
AS BAIT TO GET THE OTHERS.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.617
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH,
IT'S SLOW,

12:22.701 --> 12:25.161
BUT THAT'S
THE JOB WE SIGNED UP FOR.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.789
‐ WHAT JOB IS IT
THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.416
‐ I AM HUNTING DOWN LEADS,
OKAY?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.584
I'M TRYING TO PUT A FACE
TO THIS DUDE.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.419
I WANT JUSTICE,
JUST LIKE YOU DO.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.461
‐ JUSTICE?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.088
SURE YOU DON'T
WANT VENGEANCE?

12:35.171 --> 12:37.215
‐ LITTLE BIT OF BOTH, HUH?

12:37.299 --> 12:39.676
JUSTICE FOR
A SERIAL MASS MURDERER,

12:39.718 --> 12:41.553
AND VENGEANCE
FOR A SADISTIC BASTARD

12:41.636 --> 12:42.554
WHO CAME THIS CLOSE
TO DESTROYING MY LIFE

12:42.637 --> 12:43.638
WITH A NEEDLE.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.641
LET'S JUST CALL IT "CLOSURE."

12:49.394 --> 12:51.146
‐ WHY IS BRIGGS
STILL IN THE FIELD?

12:51.229 --> 12:53.148
I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.482
YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA GET HIM HELP.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.942
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.819
‐ I SUBMITTED YOUR REPORT
TO D. C.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.945
UNTIL WE HEAR FROM THEM,

12:59.029 --> 13:00.363
KEEP WORKING THE PLAN.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.573
I NEED YOU TO DO THIS.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.991
‐ YOU'RE GONNA BUG HIM?

13:03.074 --> 13:04.743
‐ I NEED YOU TO PUT
THE TRANSMISSION IN HIS JEEP,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.703
AND THE RECEIVER,
YOU KEEP IN YOUR CAR.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.247
‐ [scoffs] WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE TRYING TO FIND?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.584
‐ BRIGGS HAS BEEN DOING BUSINESS
WITH CAZA MEMBERS FOR YEARS.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.210
HE KNOWS THE PLAYERS
INTIMATELY.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.296
I THINK HE'S MADE DEALS
FOR HIMSELF.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.089
‐ WHY WOULD HE WORK
WITH THE CARTEL?

13:18.173 --> 13:20.175
THEY TORTURED HIM.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.718
THEY GOT HIM
ADDICTED TO HEROIN.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.554
‐ [pointed] AND THEN
THEY JUST LET HIM WALK AWAY.

13:24.596 --> 13:29.768
WHY DO YOU THINK BRIGGS HAS BEEN
SO RELUCTANT TO MOVE ON BELLO?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.811
HIS EXCUSE IS HE WANTS
TO USE BELLO

13:31.895 --> 13:34.272
"AS BAIT TO GET
TO THE OTHER MONSTERS."

13:34.314 --> 13:39.736
WHAT HE REALLY WANTS IS
TO SELL BELLO OUT.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.488
‐ YEAH.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.448
YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.038
‐ "YOU KNOW, MIKE,
SOMETIMES IT'S ALL ABOUT

13:50.121 --> 13:51.858
USING ONE MONSTER AS BAIT..."

13:51.858 --> 13:54.709
‐ "BAIT TO GET
TO THE OTHER MONSTER."

13:59.047 --> 14:01.091
[glass shattering]

14:25.031 --> 14:26.324
‐ HEY!

14:26.366 --> 14:27.575
EVERYTHING OKAY IN HERE?

14:27.659 --> 14:29.786
I HEARD
A PRETTY DRAMATIC CRASH.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.287
‐ YEAH.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.164
[sighs]

14:33.206 --> 14:35.208
FRAME FELL.
‐ REALLY?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.209
‐ YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.836
[laughs]

14:37.877 --> 14:39.170
‐ WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.171
IT WAS THE ONLY REAL
"MIKE WARREN" DECOR

14:40.213 --> 14:41.172
YOU HAD IN HERE.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.340
‐ [snickers]

14:42.382 --> 14:43.383
‐ NOW YOU'RE BACK DOWN
TO NOTHING.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.385
‐ BACK TO ZERO.
‐ COME HERE.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.719
‐ WHAT? OH.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.471
‐ [paper tearing]
YOU KNOW...

14:48.513 --> 14:51.516
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
BULLSH‐‐ DETECTOR.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.976
AND, RIGHT NOW,

14:53.017 --> 14:57.730
IT'S GOING OFF LIKE A BANSHEE.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.732
YOU KNOW, I‐‐

14:59.774 --> 15:01.151
I KNOW THAT, FOR SOME REASON,

15:01.234 --> 15:02.652
YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU CAN'T REALLY BE YOURSELF

15:02.735 --> 15:04.487
IN THIS HOUSE.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.030
BUT I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE‐‐

15:06.072 --> 15:07.157
I MEAN, MAYBE
IF I SHOWED YOU

15:07.240 --> 15:09.033
THAT I WAS ON YOUR SIDE,

15:09.075 --> 15:10.076
THAT YOU COULD TRUST ME.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.203
‐ I KNOW YOU'RE ON MY SIDE.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.455
[tape ripping]

15:13.538 --> 15:14.914
IT'S JUST COMPLICATED.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.208
‐ IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
WHEN YOU KEEP IT ALL INSIDE.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.543
‐ [scoffs]
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

15:18.585 --> 15:23.381
‐ BUT I'M TRYING TO.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.717
‐ [sighs]

15:25.758 --> 15:27.385
‐ GOOD, GREAT.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.388
OKAY, WELL, YOU JUST...
KEEP DOING EVERYTHING THE SAME,

15:30.472 --> 15:33.433
'CAUSE IT SEEMS TO REALLY
BE WORKING OUT FOR YOU.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.392
‐ [scoffs]

15:36.644 --> 15:37.729
[door shuts]

16:10.845 --> 16:11.763
[knocks]

16:11.804 --> 16:14.766
‐ HELLO! HOUSEKEEPING!

16:14.849 --> 16:16.392
‐ [scoffs]

16:18.353 --> 16:19.812
[sighs]

16:23.816 --> 16:25.902
[whispers]
SH‐‐.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.574
[curtain hooks clatter]

17:01.479 --> 17:06.109
[static]

17:24.502 --> 17:25.837
[guns cock]
‐ DON'T MOVE.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.422
‐ YOU EITHER.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.673
‐ [Mexican accent]
I DIDN'T EXPECT ODIN ROSSI

17:28.756 --> 17:29.507
TO BE A WOMAN.

17:29.591 --> 17:30.633
‐ THAT'S FUNNY,

17:30.675 --> 17:33.511
I EXPECTED HIM
TO LOOK A LOT LIKE YOU.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.941
‐ SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE ALSO.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.861
‐ MAYBE. I JUST DON'T SHOW IT
TO JUST ANYBODY.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.738
‐ MOVE TO READING DISTANCE?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.621
‐ RAFAEL CORTES?

17:59.704 --> 18:01.915
YOU <i>FEDERALE?</i>

18:01.956 --> 18:03.374
‐ <i>SI.</i>

18:03.416 --> 18:05.209
‐ CHASING A GHOST
NORTH OF THE BORDER:

18:05.293 --> 18:06.586
THAT'S A BOLD MOVE.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.340
‐ FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.758
I SHOWED YOU MINE.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.348
AH.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.474
FBI.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.059
EXCITING.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.186
I COVER THE CAZA CARTEL.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.647
THEY SENT AN ASSASSIN HERE
TO KILL ODIN.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.983
I SUSPECT YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR HIM ALSO...

18:29.067 --> 18:30.109
MS. DEMARCO?

18:30.193 --> 18:31.653
‐ AGENT DEMARCO.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.321
WHY'D YOU FOLLOW ME IN HERE?

18:33.404 --> 18:35.198
‐ I WAS DOING SURVEILLANCE.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.158
AND FINALLY I SEE
SOME MOVEMENT HERE.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.078
TELL ME, DON'T YOU THINK WE FIND
THIS HOTEL ROOM MUCH TOO EASY?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.581
I MEAN, ODIN,
HE NOT SO SLOPPY.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.625
HE HASN'T GIVEN ME ANYTHING
TO WORK WITH.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.586
‐ THAT MAKES THE TWO OF US.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.755
‐ PERHAPS...

18:50.797 --> 18:52.465
MAYBE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.093
[speaking Spanish]

18:55.134 --> 18:56.427
GET SOME REAL RESULTS.
[claps hands]

18:56.511 --> 18:59.263
‐ YEAH. I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THAT ONE.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.724
I'M A LITTLE PROTECTIVE
WITH MY...

19:01.766 --> 19:03.101
<i>INFORMACION.</i>

19:03.184 --> 19:05.436
‐ I UNDERSTAND.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.481
CAUTIOUSNESS, AGENT DEMARCO.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.947
‐ YOU BUGGED
MY GRANDFATHER'S PHOTO.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.573
I TRUSTED YOU.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.158
‐ DID YOU TELL BRIGGS
ABOUT OUR INVESTIGATION?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.493
‐ NO.

19:20.535 --> 19:21.953
WANTED SOME ANSWERS FIRST.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.455
LIKE, WHY THE BUG?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.208
‐ BRIGGS CAN BE VERY SEDUCTIVE.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.543
I WAS AFRAID
I WAS LOSING YOU TO HIM.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.585
I NEEDED TO KNOW.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.463
‐ WELL, WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.841
‐ I TRUST YOU.
YOU TRUST BRIGGS.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.385
‐ WHY ARE YOU SO FIXATED
ON THIS CASE?

19:37.468 --> 19:41.556
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
MET BRIGGS.

19:41.639 --> 19:46.144
‐ GRACELAND ISN'T
THE FIRST HOUSE OF ITS KIND.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.771
IT ISN'T EVEN THE FIRST HOUSE
OF ITS KIND FOR PAUL BRIGGS.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.441
HE STARTED A HOUSE JUST LIKE
GRACELAND FIVE YEARS AGO.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.525
IT WAS THE PROTOTYPE.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.152
THEY CALLED IT "THE ESTATE."

19:54.193 --> 19:55.403
‐ BRIGGS NEVER MENTIONED THIS.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.822
‐ I'M SURE HE DIDN'T.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.324
‐ IS THIS WHERE BRIGGS LIVED
WHEN HE WAS UNDER WITH CAZA?

20:00.366 --> 20:01.617
‐ AND JUST LIKE YOU,

20:01.701 --> 20:04.203
HE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE
WITH HIS TRAINING AGENT.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.705
‐ YEAH. ROBERTO.
IS THIS HIM?

20:05.747 --> 20:07.248
‐ HE TOLD YOU ABOUT ROBERTO?
‐ A LITTLE BIT.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.833
SAID THAT ROBERTO WORKED
THE CARTEL

20:08.875 --> 20:10.334
FROM THE MEXICAN SIDE.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.504
BRIGGS, OVER HERE, RUNNING SALE
AND DISTRIBUTION IN SO‐CAL.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.465
‐ THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I DIDN'T KNOW BRIGGS.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.175
BUT I DID KNOW ROBERTO
FROM QUANTICO.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.343
HE WAS, UH...

20:19.385 --> 20:20.720
HE WAS A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE.

20:20.803 --> 20:25.016
THE KIND OF FRIEND YOU ONLY MAKE
ONCE IN A LIFETIME.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.685
[paper rips]

20:27.769 --> 20:29.395
THREE YEARS AGO:
JULY 2ND.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.607
THE CARTEL STARTS MAKING
LOTS OF NOISE STATESIDE.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.400
‐ JANGLES.
‐ THAT'S RIGHT.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.736
ROBERTO AND BRIGGS
ARE UNDER WITH CAZA.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.238
THE BUREAU SUSPECTS
THAT THEY'RE AT RISK

20:39.280 --> 20:40.740
AND PULL THEM OFF THE CASE.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.241
TELL BRIGGS
TO TAKE A VACATION.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.285
JULY 3RD.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.329
BRIGGS CLAIMS HE WENT
ON VACATION.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.957
JULY 20TH.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.959
THE HOUSE BURNS DOWN.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.544
THE AGENTS INSIDE
BURN WITH IT.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.797
‐ YOUR FRIEND?

20:55.880 --> 20:59.258
‐ FIVE OF OUR BEST.
GONE.

20:59.342 --> 21:03.721
THE OFFICIAL FBI INVESTIGATION
SAYS IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL FIRE,

21:03.805 --> 21:07.558
ACCELERATED
BY IMPROPERLY STORED PROPANE.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.895
JULY 25TH.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.607
BRIGGS RETURNS
FROM HIS SO‐CALLED VACATION

21:14.649 --> 21:17.527
AND FINDS OUT
THAT THE HOUSE HAS BURNED DOWN.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.321
HE ACTS DEVASTATED
WHEN HE HEARS ABOUT THE DEATHS.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.281
THEY GIVE HIM SOME TIME
TO SORT HIMSELF OUT.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.908
EVENTUALLY HE RETURNS.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.035
THE FBI STARTS A NEW HOUSE.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.538
BRIGGS VOLUNTEERS
TO BE THE FIRST ONE IN.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.832
AND THIS IS THE GRACELAND
YOU LIVE IN NOW.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.918
‐ YOU CAN'T THINK THAT BRIGGS
BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.419
IF THE FBI CALLED IT
AN ACCIDENT, IF IT'S‐‐

21:35.461 --> 21:37.171
‐ YOU KNOW THE BUREAU, MIKE‐‐
SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER

21:37.255 --> 21:39.590
FOR THE FBI
TO SAY IT'S AN ELECTRICAL FIRE

21:39.674 --> 21:41.968
THAN TO ADMIT
THAT FIVE AGENTS WERE MURDERED.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.594
‐ WHY?

21:43.678 --> 21:45.972
‐ WHEN THEY PULLED BRIGGS
OFF THE CASE,

21:46.055 --> 21:51.018
HE COULD HAVE LOST ALL THE DEALS
HE MADE WITH CAZA.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.688
SO HE GAVE THEM
SOMETHING THEY WANTED.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.690
‐ YOU HAVE NO PROOF
THAT TIES HIM TO THIS.

21:55.773 --> 21:59.610
‐ THE DAY BRIGGS GOT BACK
AND SAW THE HOUSE BURNED...

21:59.652 --> 22:00.736
‐ MM‐HMM?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.113
‐ NINE HOURS EARLIER,

22:02.155 --> 22:03.739
THERE WAS A PHONE CALL MADE
TO THE MAIN HOUSE LINE

22:03.823 --> 22:05.825
FROM A PAYPHONE
ON THE ARIZONA BORDER.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.618
‐ RIGHT.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.246
‐ VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW
THAT NUMBER.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.039
‐ IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A WRONG NUMBER.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.166
‐ YEAH, COULD HAVE BEEN.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.375
EXCEPT THAT ONE MINUTE LATER

22:14.458 --> 22:16.252
ANOTHER CALL WAS MADE
FROM THE SAME PAYPHONE

22:16.294 --> 22:17.879
TO LISA:

22:17.962 --> 22:19.297
ONE OF THE AGENTS IN THE HOUSE.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.883
EVERYONE KNEW
THAT THEY WERE A COUPLE,

22:21.966 --> 22:23.050
THAT THEY WERE TOGETHER.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.635
‐ HE FOLLOWED A LEAD
INTO MEXICO.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.805
HE WAS CAPTURED
AND TORTURED. IT‐‐

22:27.847 --> 22:29.390
IT FITS RIGHT IN YOUR TIMELINE.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.975
‐ NO, I DON'T BUY IT.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.437
HE LIED ABOUT THESE CALLS.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.230
‐ JUAN, YOU'RE ACCUSING HIM
OF MURDER.

22:36.314 --> 22:38.691
‐ BUT YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.651
WE CAN PROVE ALL OF IT.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.571
WE CAN PROVE
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.116
‐ JUAN, YOU'RE‐‐YOU'RE
PATHOLOGICALLY PARANOID.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.451
AND THE SICK THING IS
IS THAT SOMEBODY GAVE YOU

22:48.534 --> 22:49.702
THE POWER TO ACT ON IT.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.662
‐ I AM YOUR CONTROL OFFICER.
‐ [sighs]

22:51.704 --> 22:53.497
‐ AND YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME
GET BRIGGS.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.916
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME PROVE
ALL OF IT.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.709
‐ NO, I'M NOT.

22:56.792 --> 22:57.237
I'M OUT.

22:59.293 --> 22:59.877
‐ AGENT WARREN.

23:02.384 --> 23:04.175
MIKE!

23:12.031 --> 23:12.457
[knock at door]

23:12.457 --> 23:14.742
‐ MEXICAN MAN LOVER.

23:14.826 --> 23:15.743
‐ YO, COME ON IN.

23:15.827 --> 23:16.995
‐ WHEW!

23:17.036 --> 23:17.996
JOHNNY, WHAT IS THAT?

23:18.037 --> 23:19.539
FOOT SWEAT, MAN?

23:19.581 --> 23:21.291
‐ REALLY NEEDED TO DO LAUNDRY
FOR, LIKE, SIX WEEKS NOW.

23:21.374 --> 23:22.542
‐ OH, YEAH?

23:22.584 --> 23:24.752
‐ AND NOW THAT JAKES

23:24.836 --> 23:26.045
I CAN STEAL HIS DETERGENT.

23:26.087 --> 23:28.047
‐ OH, YEAH. THE ONE
THAT SMELLS LIKE RAIN.

23:28.089 --> 23:30.925

23:31.009 --> 23:33.052
SO, UH, BRO,

FOR A MINUTE?

23:35.555 --> 23:36.931
‐ YEAH.

23:37.015 --> 23:38.850
‐ IS THERE SOMETHING UP
WITH CHARLIE?

23:38.892 --> 23:42.770
I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN REALLY CAGEY
WITH ME LATELY AND...

23:42.854 --> 23:43.855
COME ON, JOHNNY.

23:43.897 --> 23:45.273
TALK TO ME.

23:45.356 --> 23:47.483
‐ I KNOW SHE'S
NOT OVER WHISTLER.

23:47.525 --> 23:48.776
‐ RIGHT.

23:48.860 --> 23:49.986
‐ AND THEN THE WHOLE STUFF
THAT HAPPENED

23:50.028 --> 23:52.906
WITH YOU AND HER
AT THE C. I.'S HOUSE.

23:52.989 --> 23:54.657
‐ YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT?

23:54.699 --> 23:55.992
‐ I DON'T WANNA GET
IN THE MIDDLE

23:56.034 --> 23:57.452
OF THIS THING
BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

23:57.535 --> 23:59.037
‐ JOHNNY,
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

23:59.078 --> 24:00.663
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS
THING IS, MAN. HELP ME OUT.

24:00.747 --> 24:02.832
‐ CHARLIE GOT THIS CRAZY IDEA

24:02.916 --> 24:06.044
THAT YOU AND ODIN
ARE CONNECTED SOMEHOW.

24:06.085 --> 24:07.462
‐ [guffaws]

24:07.545 --> 24:08.838
ME AND ODIN?
‐ I KNOW.

24:08.922 --> 24:10.214
LOOK, I TOLD HER
IT WAS CRAZY.

24:10.256 --> 24:11.591

24:15.762 --> 24:17.639

IN THIS HOUSE, HUH?

24:17.722 --> 24:19.223
‐ TELL ME ABOUT IT.
‐ UNBELIEVABLE.

24:19.307 --> 24:21.893
SO LOOK, MAN,
BACK TO BUSINESS.

24:21.976 --> 24:23.186
[grunts]

24:23.227 --> 24:24.771
I THINK I WANNA FOCUS
ON JANGLES.

24:24.854 --> 24:25.897
I KNOW HE'S IN TOWN.

24:25.939 --> 24:27.273
BUT ALL MY LEADS
ARE DEAD ENDS.

24:27.357 --> 24:28.483
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

24:28.566 --> 24:30.151
‐ [scoffs]
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:30.234 --> 24:31.444
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
SOMEBODY FOR YOU.

24:31.527 --> 24:33.905
‐ WORD. THAT'S PERFECT.
LET'S ROLL RIGHT NOW.

24:39.118 --> 24:40.703
[car door shuts]

24:40.787 --> 24:43.164
‐ I'M NOT SURE THIS WAS
SUCH A GOOD IDEA, BRAH.

24:43.247 --> 24:44.666
‐ WELL, TOO LATE NOW,
JOHNNY BOY.

24:44.749 --> 24:47.335
JUST, UH, INTRODUCE ME
TO THE REASON WHY WE CAME.

24:47.418 --> 24:50.046

24:57.929 --> 24:59.222
LONG TIME NO SEE.
‐ [chuckles]

24:59.305 --> 25:00.807
‐ WHO'S THE FRIEND?

25:00.848 --> 25:02.600
‐ I WOULDN'T CALL THIS GUY
MY FRIEND.

25:02.642 --> 25:04.102
‐ YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T EITHER,
ACTUALLY.

25:04.185 --> 25:05.269
I'M HIS BROTHER‐IN‐LAW.

25:05.353 --> 25:06.896
I MARRIED
HIS BEAUTIFUL SISTER.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.940
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A SISTER, JOHNNY.

25:09.023 --> 25:10.817
‐ YEAH, I DO, I DO.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.402
SHE'S, LIKE, 20 YEARS OLDER

‐ GOOD THING LOVE KNOWS
NO AGE, MY BROTHER.

25:14.570 --> 25:15.905
‐ I AGREE.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.240
WHEN IT HITS YOU,
IT HITS YOU.

‐ HEY, LOOK, MAN,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID

25:27.834 --> 25:29.252
YOU COULD HELP ME OUT
WITH MY INVESTIGATION.

25:29.335 --> 25:30.712
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA
INVOLVE CHASING SOME SKIRT.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.255
‐ PEOPLE TALK TO HER.

25:32.338 --> 25:34.465
SHE LISTENS, SHE KNOWS THINGS.
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

25:34.507 --> 25:36.801
‐ AND THAT'S THE REASON
WHY WE'RE HERE, JOHNNY?

25:36.843 --> 25:39.053
‐ I GOT IT BAD FOR HER, MAN.

25:39.137 --> 25:41.639
EVERY TIME I SEE HER, IT'S
LIKE SCRATCHING AN OPEN WOUND.

25:41.681 --> 25:45.685
‐ WHY?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

25:45.768 --> 25:47.770
‐ VIOLETA DON'T DATE BANGERS.

25:47.812 --> 25:49.272
‐ OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

25:49.313 --> 25:51.274
YOU MET HER WHEN YOU WERE
UNDER WITH 18TH STREET, HUH?

25:51.315 --> 25:52.817
‐ YEAH.

25:52.859 --> 25:56.529
SHE MIGHT SMILE
AT ME A LOT, BUT THAT'S IT.

25:56.612 --> 25:58.322
[sighs]

25:58.364 --> 26:00.116
IF I SHOWED HER THE BADGE,
I MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT.

26:00.158 --> 26:01.868
‐ OH, YOU SEE?

26:01.951 --> 26:04.412
NEXT TIME,
MAKE YOUR COVER LAPD.

OR WHAT?

26:13.880 --> 26:14.714
WE GOT AN ASSASSIN
ON THE LOOSE.

26:14.797 --> 26:16.424

‐ PATIENCE?

26:18.051 --> 26:19.886
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

26:43.910 --> 26:46.079
ANY NEW FACES AROUND HERE
OR WHAT?

26:46.162 --> 26:48.122
‐ NO, MOSTLY
JUST THE REGULARS.

26:48.206 --> 26:51.250
NEW FACES GET SCARED AWAY
PRETTY FAST.

‐ YEAH.

26:56.464 --> 26:59.467
THAT'S ALL ANYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT AROUND MY WAY.

26:59.550 --> 27:02.178
‐ I HEARD A COUPLE GUYS TALKING
LIKE THAT,

27:02.261 --> 27:03.471
BUT I THOUGHT
THEY WERE JOKING.

27:03.554 --> 27:04.931
‐ NO JOKE.

27:04.972 --> 27:07.391
‐ BANGERS: FREAKIN' SAVAGES.

27:07.433 --> 27:11.062

27:11.104 --> 27:14.482
YEAH, SO, UM, WHO'S

‐ IT AIN'T EVEN LIKE THAT.

27:18.277 --> 27:22.073

IN A BACK BOOTH.

27:26.786 --> 27:28.538

THEY BRING OUT THE FLAVOR
IN THE OTHER.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.323

I DON'T LIKE SEEING THE DOUBT
IN YOUR EYES, MICHAEL.

28:24.260 --> 28:27.221

28:27.305 --> 28:29.098
THEY SENT THIS BUTCHER

I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

28:44.322 --> 28:47.575

THE NECESSITY OF WAR.

28:47.658 --> 28:49.493
