only differ by 2%,

the same principle
should work on our parents.

You should have
seen your faces.

Did they really
leave the tent, Nick?

50:12.750 --> 50:16.625
Hey, there's a red giant!
And that's a white dwarf!

50:16.625 --> 50:18.875
You can relate, huh, Neutron?
(LAUGHING)

50:21.792 --> 50:22.875
Hey, Jimmy,
what's the matter?

50:24.125 --> 50:25.875
Listen, in case
you haven't noticed,

50:25.875 --> 50:29.166
I'm not exactly
the tallest guy around.

50:33.750 --> 50:36.500
And next year,
there'll be dances.
Oh!

a guy who looks like he should
still be in Gymboree, huh?

(WHISPERING)
I didn't think
we liked girls yet, Jim.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.000
Oh, we don't,
we don't. No. Ugh!
Okay.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.625
Not yet.
However, one day, Carl,

50:49.625 --> 50:52.458
an influx of hormones
that we can't control

50:52.458 --> 50:54.750
will overpower
our better judgment

50:54.750 --> 50:58.417
and drive us to pursue
the female species
against our will.

50:58.417 --> 51:01.000
Stop talking
like that, Jimmy!

51:01.000 --> 51:02.834
You're gonna
give me nightmares.

Uh, listen,
I wouldn't worry, Carl.

51:04.834 --> 51:06.792
I have a feeling puberty
is light-years away
for you and me.

You know, we should
have never wished
on that star, Jimmy.

51:15.792 --> 51:18.917
And I... I...
I miss my folks.

by aliens.

Before my dad
was abducted by aliens,

51:32.125 --> 51:34.667
he would always
read me to sleep.

51:34.667 --> 51:39.083
And before my mom
was inducted by aliens,

51:39.083 --> 51:42.708
she would rub my tummy,
and she'd sing...
