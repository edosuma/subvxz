WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:06.703
<i>- (people complaining)</i>
- BOB: <i>Everybody, please!</i>

00:06.738 --> 00:08.349
Everybody, let's
try to settle down.

00:08.373 --> 00:10.540
I mean, a rent hike?
Now? Come on!

00:10.575 --> 00:12.575
Fischoeder's out of
his freaking mind.

00:12.611 --> 00:15.223
What are we supposed to do,
jack up the price of yarn?

00:15.247 --> 00:16.913
There'll be riots! Again!

00:16.948 --> 00:18.359
I'm starting to
think Mr. Fischoeder

00:18.383 --> 00:20.027
just became a landlord
for the money.

00:20.051 --> 00:21.351
(people murmuring)

00:21.386 --> 00:23.364
Everyone, can I... can I
have your attention?

00:23.388 --> 00:25.766
Silence! Yeah, tubby's talking!

00:25.790 --> 00:27.602
Mr. Fischoeder has
raised our rent before,

00:27.626 --> 00:29.604
but this new hike is
the biggest ever.

00:29.628 --> 00:30.927
None of us can afford it.

00:30.962 --> 00:32.372
Except for me, right, son?

00:32.397 --> 00:33.674
What? Ah, never mind.

00:33.698 --> 00:34.931
What? Never mind.

00:34.966 --> 00:36.377
I told Mr. Fischoeder

00:36.401 --> 00:37.778
we were coming to see him today,

00:37.802 --> 00:39.213
but what he doesn't know is

00:39.237 --> 00:40.781
if he goes ahead
with this rent hike,

00:40.805 --> 00:42.772
we're gonna give
him a rent strike!

00:42.807 --> 00:45.104
- Yeah! A what?
- A rent strike.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.688
It means if Mr. Fischoeder
tries to raise the rent,

00:47.712 --> 00:49.212
we'll stop paying it.

00:49.247 --> 00:50.625
Oh, that might
make him mad, Bobby.

00:50.649 --> 00:52.582
Yeah, landlords hate
stuff like that.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.428
Exactly. It's the
only leverage we have

00:54.452 --> 00:56.853
against a guy as big as Fischoeder.
(people murmuring)

00:56.888 --> 00:59.133
(quietly): You sure you want to
be the ringleader on this, Bob?

00:59.157 --> 01:01.269
You know, it could be better
to talk to him one-on-one.

01:01.293 --> 01:03.704
He's not our friend,
Lin, he's our landlord.

01:03.728 --> 01:05.706
We have to show him
we mean business.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.674
Mmm, Bobby Business over here.

01:07.698 --> 01:09.200
I like Bobby Business.

01:09.224 --> 01:10.335
Okay, Bob, we're in.

01:10.359 --> 01:11.758
(cheering)

01:11.794 --> 01:13.637
Yay, Bobby, you're
going on a rent strike!

01:13.661 --> 01:15.473
Just like in <i> Rent.</i>

01:15.497 --> 01:17.609
Uh, I don't think that's
what happens in <i> Rent.</i>

01:17.633 --> 01:18.899
No, yeah, that's what happens.

01:21.737 --> 01:23.581
ANDY: Now you smile.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.818
(grunts) Now you smile.

01:26.842 --> 01:28.286
(grunts) Stop it, stop it.

01:28.310 --> 01:29.854
Did we really have
to bring our kids?

01:29.878 --> 01:31.556
Did you really
have to wear that tie?

01:31.580 --> 01:33.258
It's important
to show Fischoeder

01:33.282 --> 01:34.859
that we're not just doing this
for ourselves.

01:34.883 --> 01:36.227
Some of us have families.

01:36.251 --> 01:37.818
Aw, I love kids.

01:37.853 --> 01:40.498
Which is ironic, 'cause they're
not allowed in my store.

01:40.522 --> 01:42.500
I-I run a sex shop, everybody.

01:42.524 --> 01:44.869
If we haven't met, I'm Sal.
Pervert.

01:44.893 --> 01:46.571
Hey, Sal. Uh, yeah.

01:46.595 --> 01:48.273
Uh, thanks for coming, Sal.

01:48.297 --> 01:49.897
Remember, everybody,
stick to the script.

01:49.898 --> 01:51.731
Rent hike, rent strike.

01:51.767 --> 01:53.444
Oh, look!

01:53.468 --> 01:54.779
I thought I heard
the pitter-patter

01:54.803 --> 01:56.002
of little tenant feet.

01:56.038 --> 01:58.905
Everyone, have a welcome mojito!

01:58.941 --> 01:59.951
Wow, mojitos.

01:59.975 --> 02:01.274
This is going good, Bobby.

02:01.310 --> 02:03.555
Mojito, Bob?
Uh, not for me, thanks.

02:03.579 --> 02:05.890
Oh, nonsense.
It's mojito weather.

02:05.914 --> 02:07.714
I don't want a-a mojito.

02:07.749 --> 02:08.749
Linda, mojito?

02:08.750 --> 02:10.783
Sure! Attagirl.

02:10.818 --> 02:13.498
Mr. Fischoeder, we've prepared
a few words for you.

02:13.522 --> 02:14.833
Just, um, give me a second.

02:14.857 --> 02:17.424
I'm gonna...
put the mojito down.

02:17.459 --> 02:19.337
Oh, well, that's
a safe place to put it.

02:19.361 --> 02:23.675
(clears throat) The dictionary
defines "rent" as a...

02:23.699 --> 02:25.210
This is an old draft.

02:25.234 --> 02:26.711
Uh, let me just skip ahead.
Here we go.

02:26.735 --> 02:28.568
It was Gandhi who said...

02:28.604 --> 02:31.338
Let me stop you right there,
Bob... Gandhi would want me to.

02:31.373 --> 02:33.484
You're here to tell me
that if I raise the rent,

02:33.508 --> 02:34.886
you'll have a rent strike.

02:34.910 --> 02:36.221
How did you know?

02:36.245 --> 02:37.689
Whenever tenants get together

02:37.713 --> 02:40.513
in these little clumps,
you come up with the same idea.

02:40.549 --> 02:42.527
Well, it's true...
if you raise the rent,

02:42.551 --> 02:43.761
we're, um, we're gonna strike.

02:43.785 --> 02:44.785
Right, everyone?

02:44.786 --> 02:46.231
(shouting affirmatively)

02:46.255 --> 02:48.900
Oh, but, Bob,
and, uh, loyal, uh...

02:48.924 --> 02:50.435
Bob-ists? Bob-ites?

02:50.459 --> 02:51.903
Whatever you want
to call yourselves.

02:51.927 --> 02:53.727
I'm here to tell you
there's another way.

02:53.762 --> 02:56.241
Another way? Yes. Carnies?

02:56.265 --> 02:58.465
I don't get it.
A water balloon fight!

02:58.500 --> 03:01.279
Excuse me?
I said a water balloon fight.

03:01.303 --> 03:03.948
It's how we settle
worker disputes on the wharf.

03:03.972 --> 03:06.239
Well, that and
freestyle rap battles.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.586
You may use the entire grounds
of my estate,

03:08.610 --> 03:10.922
from the garden I ignore
to the field in the back

03:10.946 --> 03:13.013
where I dump the old rides.

03:13.037 --> 03:15.249
Uh, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

03:15.273 --> 03:16.583
If you get hit, you're out.

03:16.607 --> 03:18.274
And that means
your rent is going up.

03:18.309 --> 03:20.621
Listen, Mr. Fi...
B-But for the lucky winner

03:20.645 --> 03:23.779
who manages to stay dry,
your rent gets cut in half.

03:23.815 --> 03:25.659
(all gasping) MAN: All right!

03:25.683 --> 03:27.261
I could use that
money... to buy things.

03:27.285 --> 03:28.718
Now, what do you say?

03:28.753 --> 03:30.264
(chuckles nervously) N-No.

03:30.288 --> 03:31.932
We came here
to stand together, not...

03:31.956 --> 03:33.300
Hold on, now.

03:33.324 --> 03:34.969
If any member of my family wins,

03:34.993 --> 03:36.492
my rent goes down?

03:36.527 --> 03:38.505
Yes. Children flank
their parents in battle

03:38.529 --> 03:40.307
just like in the good old days.

03:40.331 --> 03:42.932
Oh, so people with kids
have an unfair advantage.

03:42.967 --> 03:44.712
Would you call <i> that</i>
an advantage?

03:44.736 --> 03:47.281
Giddyup! (Shouts) I'm okay.

03:47.305 --> 03:49.616
Mr. Fischoeder, we're not doing
your water balloon fight.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.474
We're standing together. Right?

03:51.509 --> 03:52.820
Here's how we're gonna do this.

03:52.844 --> 03:54.822
You grab as many
balloons as you can,

03:54.846 --> 03:57.524
find cover, and at the
sound of my pistol,

03:57.548 --> 03:58.859
start ballooning.

03:58.883 --> 04:00.027
Every man for himself! Go!

04:00.051 --> 04:01.283
Jimmy, what are you doing?!

04:01.319 --> 04:02.629
I'm getting 50% off my rent!

04:02.653 --> 04:03.797
Don't move, Bob!

04:03.821 --> 04:04.965
Stay where I can balloon ya!

04:04.989 --> 04:06.667
No. No, stand together.

04:06.691 --> 04:08.669
Rent hike means rent strike!

04:08.693 --> 04:10.537
Linda, wait. Guys!

04:10.561 --> 04:11.872
Teddy? I'm with you, Bobby.

04:11.896 --> 04:13.407
I'm just gonna get
a balloon real quick,

04:13.431 --> 04:15.676
'cause everyone else
is getting balloons.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.911
Rent hike means rent...
(screams)

04:17.935 --> 04:19.747
No...!

04:19.771 --> 04:21.670
Oh, but the gun says yes.

04:25.783 --> 04:27.761
Kids, stay away
from the water balloons!

04:27.785 --> 04:29.763
Oh, right, Dad,
like you can just tell kids,

04:29.787 --> 04:31.632
"Stay away from
the water balloons."

04:31.656 --> 04:32.656
Sorry, Bob.

04:32.657 --> 04:33.967
Tenant clump un-clumped.

04:33.991 --> 04:36.092
Now it's every honky
for himself.

04:36.127 --> 04:37.638
Everyone, focus.

04:37.662 --> 04:39.895
Fischoeder is using this
to divide us.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.809
People, if we play his game,
there are many losers

04:41.833 --> 04:43.143
and only one winner.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.878
REGGIE: And that
winner's gonna be me!

04:44.902 --> 04:45.902
Reggie, no.

04:45.903 --> 04:47.448
Sorry, Bob.

04:47.472 --> 04:49.083
I'm always the doormat,
but not this time.

04:49.107 --> 04:50.451
I'm gonna win this thing and...

04:50.475 --> 04:51.485
Ah, come on.

04:51.509 --> 04:52.509
Gotcha.

04:52.510 --> 04:53.687
That was for you, Bob.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.711
Ah, geez.

04:54.712 --> 04:55.712
Am I out? I'm out.

04:55.713 --> 04:56.713
Good throw, Zeke.

04:56.714 --> 04:57.714
Thanks, J-Ju.

04:57.715 --> 04:58.859
So do we have an alliance?

04:58.883 --> 05:00.094
Hell yeah.

05:00.118 --> 05:01.550
I'm the Katniss to
your Pita Bread.

05:01.586 --> 05:03.419
Carnies, seize them!

05:04.655 --> 05:06.400
Wha...? What are you...? Help!

05:06.424 --> 05:07.701
I'll never forget you, Bob!

05:07.725 --> 05:09.036
Where are they taking them?

05:09.060 --> 05:10.904
To the porch of losers.

05:10.928 --> 05:13.374
When you're hit, you go up on
the porch and watch the rest

05:13.398 --> 05:15.376
of the competition
and have snacks.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
Ooh, snacks.

05:16.401 --> 05:17.401
Snacks?

05:17.402 --> 05:18.667
Teddy! TEDDY: Eh?

05:18.703 --> 05:19.935
What kind of snacks?

05:19.971 --> 05:22.149
Uh, cheese and French bread.

05:22.173 --> 05:23.851
Ooh. Little shrunken pickles.

05:23.875 --> 05:24.875
You're missing out.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.609
Oh, my God, I'm so hungry.

05:26.644 --> 05:28.122
Dad, you got to take cover.

05:28.146 --> 05:31.013
You're a high-value target
in a low-value body.

05:33.718 --> 05:35.696
All right, Gene and I
will form a strike team

05:35.720 --> 05:37.698
and go soak some suckers.

05:37.722 --> 05:40.434
This is one wet T-shirt
contest we don't want to win.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.957
No, kids, you're not doing that.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.937
You guys stay close
while I talk to the tenants

05:43.961 --> 05:45.072
and get them back together.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.096
And... they're gone.

05:46.097 --> 05:47.097
Don't worry, Dad.

05:47.098 --> 05:48.475
You still have me and Mom.

05:48.499 --> 05:49.743
We're like
the Secret Service, Bob.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.145
We'll never leave your side.

05:51.169 --> 05:52.679
I'm just gonna get a few
little shrunken pickles.

05:52.703 --> 05:54.437
Mom, no.
Oh, right, right, right.

05:54.472 --> 05:57.506
(people shouting)

05:57.542 --> 05:59.520
People, you're being dumb!

05:59.544 --> 06:01.577
I'm sorry to be harsh,
but it's tough love.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.056
"Tough love," aka "love."

06:03.080 --> 06:04.080
Am I right?

06:04.081 --> 06:05.592
I'm with you, Bob.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.516
This is madness.

06:07.552 --> 06:09.096
Yes, thank you, Sal!

06:09.120 --> 06:10.798
We got to stay together,

06:10.822 --> 06:13.000
like batteries and the things
I sell at my store

06:13.024 --> 06:14.423
that need the batteries.

06:14.459 --> 06:15.936
Great, Sal. Thanks.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.371
FISCHOEDER (over megaphone):
Oh, Bob's getting

06:17.395 --> 06:19.039
his little club back together.

06:19.063 --> 06:21.375
Start with the porno guy,
that's what they always say.

06:21.399 --> 06:22.709
Where's that coming from?

06:22.733 --> 06:24.711
By the way,
if you need more balloons,

06:24.735 --> 06:26.713
I've hidden buckets
around the garden.

06:26.737 --> 06:28.715
Let's just say
one of these trees bears

06:28.739 --> 06:30.539
big, wet, jiggly fruit.

06:30.575 --> 06:31.885
Uh, apple tree!

06:31.909 --> 06:33.609
Pineapple! Raisin tree!

06:33.644 --> 06:35.932
No guessing from
the porch of losers.

06:37.927 --> 06:39.961
Look, it's Harold and Edith.

06:39.996 --> 06:43.264
Whoa, that tree house
is nicer than our house.

06:43.299 --> 06:45.277
That tree is nicer
than our house.

06:45.301 --> 06:47.279
Okay, you hit Edith,
I'll hit Harold,

06:47.303 --> 06:49.815
then we'll climb up and see
how rich squirrels live.

06:49.839 --> 06:50.938
Ready?

06:50.974 --> 06:52.685
Hi-ya!

06:52.709 --> 06:54.587
Man, that old prune
can throw a balloon.

06:54.611 --> 06:56.255
There's more where
that came from, baby!

06:56.279 --> 06:58.257
Harold, defend the perimeter!

06:58.281 --> 07:00.281
Huh? Wha...? Oh, all right.
(grunts)

07:00.316 --> 07:02.125
Retreat! Retreat!

07:02.151 --> 07:03.796
Bob. What?

07:03.820 --> 07:05.464
I got an idea.

07:05.488 --> 07:07.466
We can use my bra
as a balloon launcher.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.602
Linda, no, we're not
throwing balloons.

07:09.626 --> 07:11.892
Also, that idea is not good.

07:11.928 --> 07:13.205
I think it's genius.

07:13.229 --> 07:14.940
It's not genius. Sure, it is!

07:14.964 --> 07:16.964
A bazonga bazooka! Ha!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.677
Listen, we got
to find a protected spot

07:18.701 --> 07:20.679
where we can reason with
the tenants without getting hit.

07:20.703 --> 07:21.902
Dad, look.

07:24.007 --> 07:26.151
FISCHOEDER:
Oh! It looks like Bob the rat

07:26.175 --> 07:28.520
has found the hedge maze.

07:28.544 --> 07:30.122
Ugh, he's watching us.

07:30.146 --> 07:32.847
We're going somewhere else!
Not the hedge maze!

07:32.882 --> 07:35.249
Don't listen to him!
He's in the hedge maze!

07:35.284 --> 07:37.796
Watch your step, Bob.
I have a suspicion our maid

07:37.820 --> 07:39.598
has been tossing the garbage
in there

07:39.622 --> 07:41.066
instead of walking it
to the curb.

07:41.090 --> 07:43.124
You hear that? Inga?

07:47.063 --> 07:48.863
TINA (quietly):
Jimmy Jr. And Zeke.

07:48.898 --> 07:50.598
You guys keep going.
I'll take care of these two.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.913
All right, but be careful, Tina.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.112
I was born careful.

07:53.136 --> 07:54.513
Remember? You were there.

07:54.537 --> 07:55.948
Damn, J-Ju.
We're out of balloons

07:55.972 --> 07:58.250
in a balloon fight... worst time
to be out of balloons.

07:58.274 --> 08:00.675
Yeah. Where's that balloon bucket?
TINA: Boys.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.488
Tina! (Screams)
No balloons, huh?

08:02.512 --> 08:04.645
I have one.
But there are two of you. Hmm.

08:04.681 --> 08:06.158
Tina, girl, just let us go.

08:06.182 --> 08:07.893
Yeah, let us go!

08:07.917 --> 08:10.818
I could. Or I could throw
my balloon at you, Zeke...

08:10.853 --> 08:12.698
(gasps) ...and spend some time alone
with Jimmy Jr.

08:12.722 --> 08:14.822
In this romantic/creepy
hedge maze.

08:14.969 --> 08:16.269
That'd be okay, yeah.

08:16.304 --> 08:18.282
Hold up now, girl. Hold up!

08:18.306 --> 08:20.985
Uh, you, uh... you know I like you, right?
What?

08:21.009 --> 08:22.586
I said I like you. A lot.

08:22.610 --> 08:24.688
I'm up to my butt in
it, T-bird. Come on!

08:24.712 --> 08:27.024
Huh.
Hell, J-Ju takes you for granted.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.315
Zeke!
Sorry, J-Ju, it's the truth.

08:29.350 --> 08:30.817
Tina, wh-what are you doing?

08:30.852 --> 08:32.897
I was just about to ask you
on a romantic date!

08:32.921 --> 08:34.220
Bull feces!

08:34.255 --> 08:35.975
Okay, Jimmy Jr.,
if I agreed to go on a date

08:35.990 --> 08:37.309
with you,
where would you take me?

08:37.325 --> 08:41.159
Um, to, uh... to... the drugstore.
Ugh.

08:41.196 --> 08:42.895
Zeke, can you do better
than the drugstore?

08:42.931 --> 08:45.031
Do what?
Do better than the drugstore!

08:45.066 --> 08:48.045
Uh, tacos, then to the
touch tank at the aquarium.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.314
Check out the octopuses.
Get tacos again.

08:50.338 --> 08:52.650
Maybe wash it down with
some-something to drink.

08:52.674 --> 08:54.173
All sorts of good stuff, girl.

08:54.209 --> 08:55.875
Jimmy Jr.? Your move.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.144
Uh... I-I...

08:58.179 --> 08:59.890
Just so you guys know,
I'm not enjoying this.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.681
It's very stressful.
But let's keep going.

09:01.716 --> 09:03.994
We're out in the open, kids.
Ready to shield Daddy?

09:04.018 --> 09:06.786
Front shield! Back shield!

09:06.821 --> 09:09.333
Great. Great.
I, uh... I love you.

09:09.357 --> 09:11.023
Yay! Yay! Shh!

09:11.059 --> 09:12.837
Listen, I don't know
if anyone can hear me,

09:12.861 --> 09:14.572
but we can still
turn this around.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.240
We just have to stop
fighting each other.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.309
JIMMY (mocking): Me, me, me,
me, me, me, fighting each other.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.110
(mumbling) Ugh. Jimmy.

09:20.134 --> 09:22.935
Hey, uh, sorry this isn't
working out for you, pal.

09:22.971 --> 09:24.348
Yeah, well, it could
still work out, Jimmy.

09:24.372 --> 09:26.050
I convinced Sal to stop playing.

09:26.074 --> 09:28.319
Oh, Sal, you in there? Yeah.

09:28.343 --> 09:30.988
Well, wait, uh, you don't want
to win half off your rent?

09:31.012 --> 09:32.323
Don't listen to him, Sal.

09:32.347 --> 09:34.647
Guys in your line of work
are hurting.

09:34.682 --> 09:36.660
Are we ever. Damn Internet.
(groans)

09:36.684 --> 09:38.929
Nowadays, people only
come into a sex shop

09:38.953 --> 09:40.887
if you give 'em
a "boutique experience."

09:40.922 --> 09:42.955
Pshh. Jazz music playing.

09:42.991 --> 09:45.124
Oh... Huh.
They want clean floors now.

09:45.159 --> 09:47.671
Oh, disgusting! Poor Sal.

09:47.695 --> 09:49.607
Boy, you really need
to win this thing, huh?

09:49.631 --> 09:52.343
Sal, you see what he's doing, right?
No.

09:52.367 --> 09:55.346
Oops. I, uh, gently dropped
a water balloon on the grass,

09:55.370 --> 09:57.815
and it's rolling under
the hedge to you, Sal.

09:57.839 --> 09:59.216
That's weird.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.641
(quietly): Throw it at Bob.
Throw it at Bob.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.220
Don't pick it up, Sal.

10:03.244 --> 10:04.688
Come on, kids. Throw it at Bob.

10:04.712 --> 10:05.945
JIMMY/ANDY/OLLIE:
Throw it at Bob.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.946
Throw it at Bob! Huh! Sal...

10:06.981 --> 10:08.826
Throw it at Bob! Eh!

10:08.850 --> 10:09.815
Throw it at Bob! Huh!
Uh-oh, we're losing him.

10:09.851 --> 10:11.273
Throw it at Bob! Eh!

10:11.297 --> 10:12.397
Throw it at Bob!
(slow motion): Sal,

10:12.432 --> 10:14.877
no...!

10:14.901 --> 10:16.367
(grunts)

10:16.403 --> 10:19.170
(shouts)

10:19.205 --> 10:21.439
(sobbing):
I'm sorry, Bob and Linda!

10:21.474 --> 10:23.853
Linda, are you okay? You
blocked that with your face.

10:23.877 --> 10:26.188
Yeah. My whole face flashed
before my eyes.

10:26.212 --> 10:28.858
What is wrong with you people?!

10:28.882 --> 10:30.860
They're not listening, Bob.
So screw 'em.

10:30.884 --> 10:34.285
You got to fight.
And I'm gonna have some snacks.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.331
(grunting)

10:35.355 --> 10:36.432
Lin, what are you doing?

10:36.456 --> 10:38.334
The bazonga bazooka... use it.

10:38.358 --> 10:39.835
I... don't think I will.

10:39.859 --> 10:40.903
Bob, listen carefully!

10:40.927 --> 10:43.139
You put a balloon in each cup.

10:43.163 --> 10:45.041
Pull it back like a slingshot.

10:45.065 --> 10:46.942
No, I get it.
Aim it slightly up!

10:46.966 --> 10:48.366
It's not that complicated.

10:48.401 --> 10:49.912
I love you, Bobby. Good luck!

10:49.936 --> 10:51.247
She's right.

10:51.271 --> 10:52.882
Screw these people.

10:52.906 --> 10:54.550
Good news, Mr. Fischoeder!

10:54.574 --> 10:56.552
You got me
in your balloon fight!

10:56.576 --> 10:58.954
And I'm gonna win it!
You hear that?!

10:58.978 --> 11:01.345
I heard most of it... I can't
always understand your accent.

11:01.381 --> 11:03.859
I don't have an acc...
I... Never mind!

11:03.883 --> 11:05.283
Anyway I'm gonna win!

11:08.857 --> 11:10.089
I'm playing the game!

11:10.125 --> 11:11.736
Is this what you people wanted?

11:11.760 --> 11:13.826
Huh? Huh?! Come on out!

11:13.862 --> 11:16.474
May I propose an alliance? Ha!

11:16.498 --> 11:18.331
You could've just said no.
FISCHOEDER: Attaboy, Bob!

11:18.366 --> 11:20.378
That's the wrong size
for you, Dad.

11:20.402 --> 11:21.912
But a good color. (Gasps)

11:21.936 --> 11:23.347
Did Mom tell you to take her bra

11:23.371 --> 11:24.515
and use it
as a balloon launcher?

11:24.539 --> 11:26.384
Yes. How did you know that?

11:26.408 --> 11:28.841
Mom and I have talked through
this scenario dozens of times.

11:28.877 --> 11:30.021
Take it. I-I don't
really want it.

11:30.045 --> 11:31.088
Wish me luck, kids!

11:31.112 --> 11:32.890
Yeah, okay, luck! Come on, Gene.

11:32.914 --> 11:34.191
We're going
back to the tree house

11:34.215 --> 11:35.826
to take out
a couple of old coots.

11:35.850 --> 11:37.194
We've got superior firepower.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.764
Superior and padded for comfort!

11:39.788 --> 11:42.488
"How do you know when it's the
right time to kiss a girl?"

11:42.524 --> 11:45.770
Uh, at breakfast,
in the afternoon, in the jungle,

11:45.794 --> 11:47.894
when you're married,
and at the doctor's.

11:47.929 --> 11:49.507
Great answer.
Whew, that was tough.

11:49.531 --> 11:51.776
Ugh, how long do we have
to play this game, Tina?

11:51.800 --> 11:52.965
Until I make my decision.

11:53.001 --> 11:54.500
Well, it's getting boring!

11:54.536 --> 11:56.269
Maybe you just made
my decision for me.

11:56.304 --> 11:57.415
Uh-oh! You know what?

11:57.439 --> 11:58.916
I'm gonna back away.

11:58.940 --> 12:00.548
And if you're gonna
throw it, go ahead.

12:00.575 --> 12:02.019
(grunting) Don't walk away.

12:02.043 --> 12:04.400
It's not walking. It's dancing.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.225
It's walking!
It's a backward dancy strut.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.371
Don't make me do it!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.872
Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

12:09.896 --> 12:12.008
Damn it, Jimmy! (Grunts)

12:12.032 --> 12:14.332
Whoops. Ha-ha! It's my turn now.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.845
Uh-oh, Tina!

12:15.869 --> 12:17.313
Why'd you say
all that stuff, Zeke?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.015
Why'd you tell Tina
I've had work done?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.371
It's not true!

12:20.407 --> 12:22.307
Oh, like you were born
with that nose.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.886
You're the one
with the perfect lips!

12:23.910 --> 12:25.109
Where'd you get those?!

12:25.145 --> 12:26.355
Hey, I have an idea.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.523
Why don't you throw it at Tina,

12:27.547 --> 12:28.958
and we'll be friends again.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.259
No, I'm not sure
I like that idea.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.150
Hey, look, a hedge!

12:32.185 --> 12:34.452
Bye! I think we were
all winners here.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.265
Aah! I'm afraid of heights!

12:36.289 --> 12:37.934
You're on the first step.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.591
You look like an ant from here!

12:39.626 --> 12:41.971
Why do you think they want
to get up there so bad?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.639
You want the high ground
in a balloon fight.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.508
Edith would know that.
She fought the dinosaurs.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.877
Come on, help me tie
Mom's bra to a tree.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.639
Then let's tie my
underwear to a bird.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.347
Get back on that ladder, Harold.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.015
You're not having
a heart attack.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.117
You've never had a heart attack.
I did once.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.387
That was a stroke, if you could
even call it that, you big baby.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.623
Okay, ready for launch.
This is it.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.115
Let's make "Double D"
stand for doused and dampened.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.563
Oh! Aah! Damn!

13:07.587 --> 13:09.498
Wow. I did not
expect that to work.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.400
Wait till the Army
hears about this.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.225
(both grunting)

13:14.261 --> 13:15.938
(gasps)

13:15.962 --> 13:17.940
It's everything
we've ever wanted!

13:17.964 --> 13:19.397
Can we get our mail here?

13:19.432 --> 13:21.043
Tree mail! Tree cable!

13:21.067 --> 13:22.979
Uh, hello?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.902
Felix? Do you live here?

13:24.938 --> 13:27.383
Uh, yes. My brother kicked me
out of the main house

13:27.407 --> 13:30.019
because I have sleep apnea,
and sleep fartnea.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.621
(gasps) Look! Balloons!

13:31.645 --> 13:34.890
Of course! "One of these trees
bears wet, jiggly fruit."

13:34.914 --> 13:36.425
That is a weird thing to say.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.060
Oh, my God, balloons!
Let's play!

13:38.084 --> 13:41.085
BOB: Kids?! Dad?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.465
Good, you got the high ground!

13:42.489 --> 13:44.000
Okay, wait for my signal.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.568
We're gonna pound these punks!

13:45.592 --> 13:47.125
Whoa. Who's the new guy?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.471
(laughing)

13:48.495 --> 13:50.306
♪ Would you like to ride ♪

13:50.330 --> 13:53.398
♪ In my beautiful balloon? ♪

13:53.433 --> 13:58.870
♪ Would you like to glide
in my beautiful balloon? ♪

13:58.905 --> 14:03.819
♪ We could float among the stars
together, you and I ♪

14:03.843 --> 14:06.489
♪ Oh, we can fly ♪

14:06.513 --> 14:07.912
♪ Yeah, we can... ♪

14:07.947 --> 14:09.592
LINDA: (gasps)
It's Bobby and Tina!

14:09.616 --> 14:11.494
It's just the Belchers
and the Pestos now.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.995
Go, Bobby, go!

14:13.019 --> 14:15.820
Ooh, salami! Who catered this?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.334
Jimmy, come out. This ends now!

14:18.358 --> 14:19.535
(grunts) Tina!

14:19.559 --> 14:21.170
Hey, you broke my balloon!

14:21.194 --> 14:22.538
(chuckles)

14:22.562 --> 14:24.206
Well, at least it
was fair and square.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.830
In my back when
I wasn't looking.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.144
Give up, Bob.
I've got more balloons than you,

14:28.168 --> 14:29.879
and I've got boy shields.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.447
Hi, Louise and Gene
and Tina's Dad!

14:31.471 --> 14:33.282
Back shield,
ease up on my throat!

14:33.306 --> 14:34.617
Sorry! (Coughs)

14:34.641 --> 14:36.452
You may have boy shields, Jimmy,

14:36.476 --> 14:39.377
but I have boy and girl snipers!

14:41.014 --> 14:42.591
I said...

14:42.615 --> 14:44.949
(loudly):
I have boy and girl snipers!

14:44.984 --> 14:48.886
These are dolls and a tree
house for the dolls to play in.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.366
Mmm.
Oh, whoa, whoa, careful, please.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.634
They're made to
look like antiques.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.135
BOB: Snipers! Shoot him!

14:53.159 --> 14:54.638
Oh, crap.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.685
Oh, they're too far away.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.309
Mom's bra doesn't have
that kind of range.

14:59.344 --> 15:00.655
I guess Mom's never really had

15:00.679 --> 15:02.245
to launch her boobs very far.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.325
Uh, do you want
to use this maybe?

15:04.349 --> 15:06.950
Uh, yeah! Why do you have this?

15:06.985 --> 15:10.019
It's how I send my dirty laundry
over to the main house.

15:10.055 --> 15:11.221
Load it up! Quick!

15:11.256 --> 15:13.501
(cackling)

15:13.525 --> 15:16.926
Ha! You only got
my kids, idiots!

15:16.962 --> 15:18.272
All right, Bob...

15:18.296 --> 15:20.129
Wait. Good-bye kiss!
Good-bye kiss!

15:20.165 --> 15:22.043
Oh, God. Okay, okay, okay,
go, go, go, go!

15:22.067 --> 15:23.377
Let's see if you can dodge this.

15:23.401 --> 15:24.712
Son of a bitch!

15:24.736 --> 15:26.202
Sorry, Dad. Yeah, sorry.

15:26.238 --> 15:29.083
(grunting)

15:29.107 --> 15:31.074
All right, all right.
Easy now, easy now.

15:33.211 --> 15:35.389
Uh, Bob? What's the problem?

15:35.413 --> 15:37.592
Yeah, quit hot-dogging
and do it already.

15:37.616 --> 15:39.694
This is the last balloon.

15:39.718 --> 15:42.497
Yes, yes, yes. Get to it,
you grandstanding foreigner.

15:42.521 --> 15:44.532
No, I have the last balloon.

15:44.556 --> 15:47.268
That means the game doesn't end
till I say it does.

15:47.292 --> 15:49.325
You all have to listen to me!
Ha-ha!

15:49.361 --> 15:51.706
We were gonna work together,
but no!

15:51.730 --> 15:53.572
You wanted to play
this stupid game,

15:53.598 --> 15:56.165
and now <i> you</i> all lose!

15:56.201 --> 15:57.979
Oh, someone's a sore winner.

15:58.003 --> 15:59.614
What made me think
people coming together

15:59.638 --> 16:00.681
could accomplish anything?

16:00.705 --> 16:02.483
People are the worst!

16:02.507 --> 16:04.797
Coming together is the worst!

16:04.821 --> 16:06.766
Are you finished yet? No!

16:06.790 --> 16:09.102
As long as I have this balloon,
you will hear me!

16:09.126 --> 16:11.237
I will be heard! Damn it.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.228
Well, let's call that a tie.
How about this?

16:13.263 --> 16:15.708
New game. Everybody get Bob.
What?

16:15.732 --> 16:18.444
That's right. Each time
anyone hits Bob with a balloon,

16:18.468 --> 16:22.237
they get $50 off their rent,
and, uh, Bob gets $50 added.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.705
What?! How do I win?

16:23.740 --> 16:26.485
Uh, uh, you have to...
last until sundown.

16:26.509 --> 16:28.415
That's when the game ends.

16:28.439 --> 16:30.472
And Inga and I watch
<i>World's Craziest Car Chases.</i>

16:30.508 --> 16:31.607
Ready, everyone?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.075
Wait! No, no, no, no, no!

16:33.110 --> 16:34.410
Bob, you have ten seconds
to run.

16:34.445 --> 16:37.057
Ten, nine, eight, six, one.

16:37.081 --> 16:39.148
Go! (Bob screaming)

16:42.661 --> 16:43.927
Help!

16:43.962 --> 16:45.473
Leave Bob alone!

16:45.497 --> 16:46.774
(panting)

16:46.798 --> 16:48.342
This is how
they want to play it?

16:48.366 --> 16:49.732
(grunting) Felix,

16:49.768 --> 16:50.934
do you have
any more dirty clothes?

16:50.969 --> 16:52.680
How dirty we talking? Wow me.

16:52.704 --> 16:54.482
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

16:54.506 --> 16:56.450
(Bob screaming)

16:56.474 --> 16:58.519
I'll try to keep this briefs.

16:58.543 --> 16:59.776
(all yelling)

16:59.811 --> 17:01.277
(grunts)

17:02.881 --> 17:04.325
Go, Bob! Go!

17:04.348 --> 17:06.382
(Bob yelling)

17:08.787 --> 17:10.420
Whoa.

17:10.454 --> 17:11.854
MAN (in distance):
I'm gonna look over here!

17:11.890 --> 17:13.166
Oh, I got to hide.

17:13.191 --> 17:15.502
(grunting)

17:15.527 --> 17:18.428
WOMAN: Where are you?
MAN: Got a balloon for you.

17:20.464 --> 17:22.310
Wow, Dad might just make it
through this thing.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.633
It's almost sundown.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.212
It's almost sundown?

17:25.236 --> 17:26.714
I didn't bring
my evening face cream.

17:26.738 --> 17:28.214
Where do you think Dad is hiding?
(creaking)

17:28.239 --> 17:29.539
And did that pig just fart?

17:29.574 --> 17:30.907
Hi, Dad. You farted.

17:30.942 --> 17:32.753
(quietly):
It was the seat. Go away!

17:32.777 --> 17:34.522
Get in the pig with
you? You got it.

17:34.546 --> 17:36.857
No, you guys are gonna
draw attention.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.682
I can win this thing if I just
lay low for another 20 minutes.

17:39.718 --> 17:41.495
So you're saying
we better get comfortable?

17:41.519 --> 17:42.819
(grunting)

17:42.854 --> 17:44.298
BOB: No, no, no, no!

17:44.322 --> 17:46.756
Bob? You over there, buddy?

17:46.791 --> 17:48.269
It's not safe here.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.603
I have to make a run for it.

17:49.627 --> 17:51.439
Dad, running's not your thing.

17:51.463 --> 17:53.874
Do you have a plan that involves
standing around all the time?

17:53.898 --> 17:55.509
You're right. Dad
can't move very well.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.866
Thanks, Tina.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.779
But maybe <i> we</i> can move Dad.

17:58.803 --> 18:00.348
Push harder!

18:00.372 --> 18:02.472
(grunting) Yes.

18:02.507 --> 18:03.851
That's great! That could work!

18:03.875 --> 18:05.753
He's over there! Get him!

18:05.777 --> 18:07.700
Bob? Oh, God. Oh, God.

18:07.724 --> 18:09.757
Back off, you maniacs!

18:09.793 --> 18:10.992
Leave my Bobby alone!

18:11.027 --> 18:12.505
Step aside, Linda.

18:12.529 --> 18:13.873
Make me, Reggie!

18:13.897 --> 18:16.242
Come on, sandwich man,
you want to dance?!

18:16.266 --> 18:18.377
Get back! That pig up there
is our father!

18:18.401 --> 18:20.246
And our dad's in there!

18:20.270 --> 18:22.904
We didn't come this far
to <i> not</i> throw balloons at Bob.

18:22.939 --> 18:23.972
Move, please.

18:24.007 --> 18:25.785
Okay. You know what? Fine.

18:25.809 --> 18:28.554
You want to win money
off your rent? Be my guest.

18:28.578 --> 18:31.491
Uh, Linda?
It's over, Bob. You're getting ballooned.

18:31.515 --> 18:33.515
What do you got, 50 balloons?
A hundred?

18:33.550 --> 18:34.560
That sounds high.

18:34.584 --> 18:36.262
Our rent's gonna be nuts.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.364
We'll go out of business,
live in a box.

18:38.388 --> 18:40.500
You kids are gonna
have to work in factories.

18:40.524 --> 18:42.502
I want to work
at C&C Music Factory!

18:42.526 --> 18:43.858
Linda, what are you doing?

18:43.894 --> 18:45.471
Zip it, Bob!

18:45.495 --> 18:47.039
You had it coming
after everything you did.

18:47.063 --> 18:48.608
You brought everyone together,
looked out for 'em,

18:48.632 --> 18:49.931
stood up for what's right.

18:49.966 --> 18:51.310
Oh, I see what you're doing.

18:51.334 --> 18:52.678
Go ahead, destroy everything

18:52.702 --> 18:54.380
this family's worked for.

18:54.404 --> 18:56.382
Oh, goodie! I'm just in time.

18:56.406 --> 18:59.352
Looks like Bob is
about to be ballooned.

18:59.376 --> 19:02.310
Direct hits only, people.
No splash, no cash.

19:06.783 --> 19:07.949
Horrible aim.

19:11.588 --> 19:12.899
What's wrong with you people?

19:12.923 --> 19:14.956
Must be a case
of mass butterfingers.

19:14.991 --> 19:16.636
We're standing with Bob.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.871
Yeah, just like before,
but this time for real.

19:18.895 --> 19:20.406
Right, Jimmy?

19:20.430 --> 19:22.508
Ah, I wanted to throw
a balloon at Bob.

19:22.532 --> 19:24.477
It's fine. I'll throw
something at him later.

19:24.501 --> 19:25.811
Maybe a meatball.

19:25.835 --> 19:27.313
Thanks, everyone.

19:27.337 --> 19:28.503
Rent hike, rent strike!

19:28.538 --> 19:30.371
ALL (chanting):
Rent hike, rent strike!

19:30.407 --> 19:32.752
Oh, I get it.
Just because I'm a landlord,

19:32.776 --> 19:34.754
and I wear a white suit
and an eye patch,

19:34.778 --> 19:36.822
and I raise your rent
and ride around

19:36.846 --> 19:40.259
and throw firecrackers at you,
I'm the bad guy.

19:40.283 --> 19:42.750
Well, landlords have problems.

19:42.786 --> 19:44.430
Landlords have problems.

19:44.454 --> 19:45.831
So long.

19:45.855 --> 19:47.400
(pedal clicking)

19:47.424 --> 19:48.768
(groans) See?

19:48.792 --> 19:51.626
My golf cart loses its charge
just like yours.

19:51.661 --> 19:53.372
Oh. Mr. Fischoeder,

19:53.396 --> 19:54.796
I-I just realized something.

19:54.831 --> 19:56.742
Is... is it okay if I sit?

19:56.766 --> 19:58.477
Mm. People are staring.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.580
Mr. Fischoeder, before
I got all these people together,

20:00.604 --> 20:02.281
maybe I should have
come to you first

20:02.305 --> 20:04.383
and talked to you one-on-one.
Mm.

20:04.407 --> 20:06.986
I should have given you a chance
to be the good guy. Mm.

20:07.010 --> 20:09.021
I've known you a long time,
and I just realized now

20:09.045 --> 20:10.756
I might have...
hurt your feelings.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.358
Here's the thing, Bob.

20:12.382 --> 20:14.549
I like you.
You're good people, sort of.

20:14.584 --> 20:15.928
You don't have to say "sort of."

20:15.952 --> 20:17.630
And I've always
thought of myself

20:17.654 --> 20:19.332
as the kind of landlord
you could pal around with.

20:19.356 --> 20:21.934
Someone you could pat on the
butt as a sign of affection.

20:21.958 --> 20:24.470
That would...
I... I would do that.

20:24.494 --> 20:25.960
No, but don't touch me.

20:25.996 --> 20:28.407
The truth is, Bob,
I was only raising the rent

20:28.431 --> 20:30.031
so you would notice me.

20:30.066 --> 20:31.911
Really? No. I wanted a pool.

20:31.935 --> 20:33.579
You can't get chicks
with a hedge maze.

20:33.603 --> 20:34.914
Sure. Makes sense.

20:34.938 --> 20:36.537
Bob, I've reconsidered.

20:36.573 --> 20:37.984
Maybe I could postpone the pool

20:38.008 --> 20:40.353
and the rent hike
for a year or two.

20:40.377 --> 20:43.322
(cheering)

20:43.346 --> 20:45.546
You'll be out of business
by then, Bob, don't worry.

20:45.582 --> 20:47.393
Thank you, Mr. Fischoeder.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.395
I know exactly
how we should celebrate.

20:49.419 --> 20:51.886
(excited shouting)

20:53.857 --> 20:56.402
(laughs) Don't hit my pants!
I'm wearing white.

20:56.426 --> 20:58.656
You'll see the outline
of my wiener.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.951
Oh, what the hell. Fire away!

21:00.975 --> 21:05.716
