00:05.267 --> 00:08.968
Captain's log, stardate 5029.5.

00:09.146 --> 00:13.274
Responding to a distress call
from our scientific colony on Triacus,

00:13.442 --> 00:16.062
we are beaming down to investigate.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:48.228 --> 00:49.687
Professor Starnes.

00:54.693 --> 00:55.973
It's Kirk.

01:08.833 --> 01:11.039
He's dead, captain.

01:13.045 --> 01:14.954
He didn't seem to know me.

01:37.779 --> 01:39.902
Cyalodin.

01:40.198 --> 01:42.357
Self-inflicted.

01:50.459 --> 01:54.539
Must destroy ourselves.
Alien upon us.

01:54.713 --> 01:58.296
The enemy from within. The enemy!

01:58.467 --> 02:02.761
All this. Self-inflicted.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.138
Mass suicide.

02:10.145 --> 02:13.597
- You did not! You missed me!
- I did so!

02:14.651 --> 02:16.976
Hi. Who are you?

02:18.238 --> 02:22.567
- Kirk of the starship Enterprise.
- I'm Tommy Starnes.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.862
- This is Mary, Steve, Ray and Don.
- Hello.

02:26.037 --> 02:29.453
Come on. Play with us. Come on.

02:29.624 --> 02:33.622
Ring around the rosy
Pocketful of posy

02:33.795 --> 02:38.504
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

02:41.762 --> 02:45.807
Ring around the rosy
Pocketful of posy

02:45.975 --> 02:50.304
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

03:01.491 --> 03:04.990
Space, the final frontier.

03:10.458 --> 03:14.503
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:14.671 --> 03:18.716
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:18.884 --> 03:22.632
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:22.804 --> 03:26.138
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:11.688 --> 04:14.689
Captain's log, supplementary.

04:16.026 --> 04:18.434
We have buried the members
of the Starnes' exploration party.

04:18.612 --> 04:22.562
Everyone has been deeply affected
by what has happened here,

04:22.741 --> 04:24.900
with some important exceptions.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.997
Let's go and play.

04:37.214 --> 04:38.495
I'm gonna get you!

04:38.883 --> 04:41.172
I'm gonna get you.

04:42.428 --> 04:46.011
- No sign of grief?
- No, Jim, no indication of any kind.

04:46.182 --> 04:47.380
Or fear?

04:47.559 --> 04:49.516
They seem completely secure
and unafraid.

04:49.686 --> 04:52.224
You insist that their behaviour
is a sign of traumatic shock?

04:52.397 --> 04:55.564
I don't insist, Jim,
but I can't dismiss the possibility.

04:55.734 --> 05:01.653
A child suppresses the fact that both
parents are dead? I can't believe it.

05:01.823 --> 05:05.275
Humans do have an amazing capacity
for believing what they choose

05:05.452 --> 05:07.860
and excluding that which is painful.

05:08.038 --> 05:10.494
Not these children, to this extent.
It's incredible.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.493
What these children saw
is incredible, Jim.

05:12.668 --> 05:15.918
The way those deaths occurred,
any reaction is possible,

05:16.088 --> 05:18.661
including lacunar amnesia.

05:18.841 --> 05:20.169
That's my diagnosis.

05:20.342 --> 05:23.047
Until specific tests can be made,
it remains that.

05:23.220 --> 05:27.088
I'll be guided by that opinion, doctor,
for the present.

05:28.809 --> 05:31.016
What about questioning them?

05:31.187 --> 05:33.559
Not until the fabric
of the traumatisation weakens

05:33.731 --> 05:36.436
or you can come up with another
explanation for their behaviour.

05:37.110 --> 05:41.060
Forcing them to see this experience
now could cause permanent damage.

05:42.949 --> 05:44.064
Accepted, doctor.

05:47.662 --> 05:49.322
Be careful.

05:53.293 --> 05:55.963
I'm sorry, Captain Kirk.

06:05.764 --> 06:08.635
Children? Children, listen to me.

06:08.809 --> 06:10.932
It's late,
and it's time to go up to the ship.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.511
Oh, not yet.

06:14.315 --> 06:18.526
- But we're just beginning to have fun.
- Not now.

06:18.694 --> 06:23.072
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
you'll go up with the doctor.

06:28.913 --> 06:31.239
Come on. It's time to be going.

06:34.294 --> 06:39.170
Whatever happened here
is locked up inside those children.

06:39.341 --> 06:44.003
The attack on Professor Starnes' party
must surely have been unprovoked.

06:44.179 --> 06:48.224
Attack? Mass suicide
is what it seems to be.

06:48.392 --> 06:52.769
I stand corrected, captain.
Induced would be a more precise term.

06:52.938 --> 06:55.097
Induced by an outside force.

06:56.692 --> 06:59.728
- Such as?
- The release of bacteria.

06:59.904 --> 07:05.029
Or a helpless mental depression
and a state of suicidal anxiety

07:05.201 --> 07:06.944
could have been chemically induced.

07:07.119 --> 07:09.159
What would make
the children immune?

07:09.330 --> 07:12.414
I do not know. But it is possible.

07:13.376 --> 07:18.667
Then the children would have been
exempted by conscious design.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.667
A valid assumption, I would say.

07:20.842 --> 07:26.299
And their present behaviour
explained by a fear of punishment.

07:26.765 --> 07:29.338
Or the promise of reward.

07:30.352 --> 07:34.219
An attack by an unknown assailant

07:34.398 --> 07:36.556
on an uninhabited planet.

07:36.733 --> 07:41.027
This planet is uninhabited, Mr. Spock,
to the best of our information?

07:41.196 --> 07:42.525
At present, yes.

07:48.704 --> 07:51.658
- Odd.
- Getting a reading?

07:54.752 --> 08:00.506
There seems to be some disturbance
coming from that cave.

08:14.606 --> 08:16.812
Picking up any life forms,
Mr. Spock?

08:16.983 --> 08:19.937
Definitely not humanoid, captain.

08:20.111 --> 08:23.066
Impossible to make
any specific identification.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.534
The readings do not correlate
with any known information.

08:27.703 --> 08:29.861
Oh, that's strange.

08:31.498 --> 08:35.033
That's very strange.

08:35.210 --> 08:39.623
I'm getting a feeling of anxiety
in this place.

08:40.174 --> 08:44.338
That doesn't sound very scientific,
does it?

08:44.512 --> 08:47.881
But it's strongest right here.

08:48.057 --> 08:50.465
I'm not aware of it, captain.

08:51.144 --> 08:54.595
Maybe that's what's registering
on your tricorder.

08:54.772 --> 08:56.183
I am not familiar with anxiety,

08:56.357 --> 08:59.477
but I was not aware that
it could be registered on sensors.

08:59.652 --> 09:01.277
No.

09:03.364 --> 09:07.149
Of course. That's... That's me.

09:08.703 --> 09:09.984
That's me.

09:10.163 --> 09:16.083
But what's causing your tricorder
to react?

09:24.053 --> 09:26.259
- Are you all right, captain?
- Yes, I'm... I'm fine.

09:26.430 --> 09:29.929
I'm fine.

09:32.019 --> 09:37.014
Just some sympathetic vibration
with what happened here.

09:37.191 --> 09:39.943
Let's get back to the ship.

09:40.111 --> 09:44.856
I want to check out those tapes
from Professor Starnes' tricorder.

09:47.243 --> 09:50.493
And I am going to question
those children.

09:55.168 --> 09:58.086
All right, children.
Now, each card is a different flavour.

09:58.255 --> 10:01.256
You take your pick, and the computer
will mix your favourite combination.

10:01.424 --> 10:03.382
What would you like?
Just call out your favourite.

10:03.552 --> 10:04.666
- Chocolate.
- Vanilla.

10:04.845 --> 10:07.762
- Cherry and banana.
- Okay. Okay.

10:13.812 --> 10:17.016
Well.
Would you like a surprise, Stevie?

10:17.191 --> 10:18.602
All right.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.984
It's coconut and vanilla.
They're both white.

10:30.913 --> 10:32.989
There, there, now, Stevie.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.743
There are unpleasant surprises
as well as pleasant ones.

10:36.919 --> 10:38.793
That was your unpleasant surprise.

10:39.422 --> 10:42.293
Now, what would you like
for your pleasant surprise?

10:43.468 --> 10:46.006
Chocolate wobble and pistachio.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.504
Well, coming right up.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.880
And peach.

10:54.062 --> 10:55.141
All right.

10:55.313 --> 10:58.517
It's gonna be a wonderful surprise.

11:05.657 --> 11:08.113
The tests show no evidence
that tension is due to lying.

11:08.285 --> 11:10.444
They behave as though
nothing had gone wrong.

11:10.621 --> 11:12.246
They check out sound physically,

11:12.414 --> 11:14.787
and there are no signs
of any bio-chemical substance

11:14.959 --> 11:16.536
to account for their present state.

11:16.711 --> 11:18.869
- I have no answers, Jim.
- There has to be an answer.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.004
Can't it wait till we get
to a starbase hospital

11:21.174 --> 11:22.834
so they can be checked out
by a specialist?

11:23.009 --> 11:27.470
We're not leaving here until we find out
what went on, or what's going on.

11:27.639 --> 11:31.173
I won't prevent you questioning them,
but it could harm the children if you do.

11:31.351 --> 11:35.728
It could be far worse for them if I don't,
and for us too.

11:35.897 --> 11:37.641
Be careful.

11:39.943 --> 11:43.988
- And I got another flavour on top.
- After this, we can all play games.

11:45.532 --> 11:46.611
Yeah.

11:46.783 --> 11:48.990
How do you like getting your ice cream
out of a computer?

11:49.161 --> 11:51.830
- I'll eat some more before bed.
- That was fun.

11:51.997 --> 11:54.915
Well, well, well,
you're all having such a good time.

11:55.084 --> 11:57.835
- I think I'll join you. Is that all right?
- Please do.

11:58.003 --> 11:59.996
- All right. I'll have a dish too.
- Of course.

12:00.172 --> 12:03.339
A little one. A very small one.

12:03.509 --> 12:06.759
- It's better than Triacus, isn't it?
- That dirty old planet?

12:06.929 --> 12:09.337
- What's so good about that place?
- Yeah.

12:09.515 --> 12:13.383
You weren't there very long.
You don't know.

12:13.561 --> 12:15.969
I don't think your parents liked it
very much either.

12:16.147 --> 12:19.018
- Yes, they did.
- Yeah, mine sure did.

12:19.192 --> 12:21.268
Parents like stupid things.

12:21.444 --> 12:24.481
Oh, I don't know about that.
Parents like children.

12:25.782 --> 12:27.193
That's what you think.

12:28.785 --> 12:30.113
I'm sure your parents loved you.

12:30.287 --> 12:33.038
That's why they took you with them
to Triacus.

12:33.498 --> 12:36.748
So they wouldn't be so far away
from you for such a long time.

12:36.918 --> 12:39.623
That would make them very unhappy,
and they'd miss you.

12:39.796 --> 12:43.415
I'm sure that
you would miss them too.

12:50.933 --> 12:53.341
- Busy, busy.
- Busy, busy.

12:53.519 --> 12:55.559
Busy, busy, busy.

12:55.730 --> 13:00.937
Busy, busy, busy.

13:09.786 --> 13:12.906
- Guess what we are.
- I know. A swarm of bees.

13:13.081 --> 13:15.702
Busy, busy, busy.

13:17.544 --> 13:21.755
Watch out. Watch out. I'll sting you.

13:24.301 --> 13:25.415
Now, wait a minute.

13:25.594 --> 13:27.136
Can we have some more ice cream,
please?

13:29.306 --> 13:31.429
No, I don't think so.
It'll spoil your dinner.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.842
See what I told you? They all say it.

13:34.019 --> 13:35.763
Yeah.

13:38.607 --> 13:40.932
All right, you've had a busy day.
You could use some rest.

13:41.110 --> 13:42.770
Nurse Chapel
will see you to your quarters.

13:42.945 --> 13:45.187
Very good idea, captain. Come on.

13:45.364 --> 13:47.653
- Do we have to?
- That's all right, that's enough.

13:47.825 --> 13:49.450
- Tommy, just a moment.
- Here we go.

13:49.619 --> 13:53.319
I'd like to ask you a question.
Come and sit down.

14:00.380 --> 14:03.464
Tommy, will you tell me
what you saw?

14:03.633 --> 14:05.424
Saw where?

14:06.261 --> 14:10.045
In the cave. On the planet.
On Triacus.

14:10.223 --> 14:13.260
- You were there.
- Did you see your father today?

14:13.602 --> 14:16.057
- I saw him.
- Did he seem upset?

14:16.229 --> 14:18.934
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- What about?

14:19.107 --> 14:20.483
Well, I didn't ask him.

14:20.984 --> 14:23.475
What was going on
that would have upset him?

14:24.154 --> 14:26.480
How should I know?
He was always upset.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.614
Just like you, Captain Kirk.

14:30.911 --> 14:34.576
I'm not upset with you, Tommy,
or your friends.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.533
We invited you
aboard the Enterprise.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.000
Why would I do that
if I didn't like you?

14:41.172 --> 14:42.334
You have your reasons.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.041
Aren't you unhappy
about leaving Triacus?

14:47.220 --> 14:50.090
That place? That's for adults.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.799
Aren't you upset
about leaving your parents?

14:54.727 --> 14:58.346
My parents? They love it down there.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.516
Always busy.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.142
They're happy.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.860
Can I go now?
I'm tired too, you know.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.490
- Yes, certainly. I'll take you.
- I know the way.

15:24.008 --> 15:25.288
Kirk to Security.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.179
Post a guard on the children.

15:29.347 --> 15:32.051
They're to be kept
under constant watch.

15:32.225 --> 15:35.843
Hail, hail, fire and snow.

15:36.020 --> 15:39.021
Call the angel, we will go.

15:39.190 --> 15:42.891
Far away, for to see,

15:43.069 --> 15:45.940
friendly angel, come to me.

15:46.448 --> 15:50.148
Hail, hail, fire and snow.

15:50.327 --> 15:53.577
Call the angel, we will go.

15:53.747 --> 15:56.499
Far away, for to see,

15:56.666 --> 15:59.751
friendly angel, come to me.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.707
Hail, hail...

16:06.218 --> 16:09.254
You have done very well, my friends.

16:09.763 --> 16:12.599
You have done what must be done.

16:12.766 --> 16:15.851
You have come aboard
the Enterprise.

16:16.020 --> 16:20.598
Now our destination
is a Federation settlement.

16:20.775 --> 16:25.651
Captain Kirk will undoubtedly
choose a closer station.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.980
Do not let that deter you.

16:28.157 --> 16:31.941
Marcos Xll has millions of people
on it.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.074
Nearly a million
will join us as our friends.

16:35.248 --> 16:38.035
The rest will be our enemies.

16:38.209 --> 16:41.744
Together with our other friends
who will join us,

16:41.922 --> 16:46.465
we will defeat our enemies
as we defeated them on Triacus.

16:46.635 --> 16:51.261
A million friends on Marcos
will make us invincible.

16:51.431 --> 16:56.592
No one will tell us where to go,
when to sleep, where to eat.

16:56.770 --> 16:59.522
The universe will be mine
to command,

16:59.690 --> 17:01.813
yours to play in.

17:01.984 --> 17:07.060
To accomplish this great mission,
we must first control the Enterprise.

17:07.239 --> 17:11.403
To control the ship,
we first must control the crew.

17:11.577 --> 17:15.622
You know how to do that.
That is your next task.

17:16.332 --> 17:21.492
And as you believe,
so shall you do, so shall you do.

17:21.671 --> 17:26.463
As you believe,
so shall you do, so shall you do.

17:26.634 --> 17:30.928
As you believe,
so shall you do, so shall you do.

17:43.652 --> 17:46.321
Maintaining standard orbit, captain.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.354
Lieutenant Uhura, any report
from the planet's security team?

17:49.533 --> 17:51.822
Everything is quiet, sir.

17:52.828 --> 17:55.035
Captain, I have extracted
the salient portion

17:55.206 --> 17:57.827
- of Professor Starnes' tapes.
- Good.

18:01.837 --> 18:03.747
Among the technical facts
he gathered,

18:03.923 --> 18:07.506
Professor Starnes also offered
some rather unscientific hypotheses.

18:07.677 --> 18:09.255
Let's see them.

18:10.930 --> 18:13.884
Log date 5025.3.

18:14.058 --> 18:15.968
Ever since our arrival on Triacus,

18:16.144 --> 18:20.272
I've felt a certain growing feeling
of uneasiness.

18:20.774 --> 18:24.724
At first I attributed it
to the usual case of nerves

18:24.903 --> 18:27.690
associated with any new project.

18:27.864 --> 18:30.402
However, I found that
the rest of my associates

18:30.575 --> 18:33.577
are also bothered
by these anxieties.

18:33.745 --> 18:36.996
The only ones not affected
are the children.

18:37.166 --> 18:40.202
Bless them, find the whole thing
an exciting adventure.

18:40.377 --> 18:42.703
To be young again.

18:43.422 --> 18:47.669
Let's see some more of these
unscientific hypotheses, Mr. Spock.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.090
5032.4.

18:56.269 --> 19:01.809
The feeling of anxiety we've all been
experiencing is growing worse.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.770
There is another portion, captain,

19:03.943 --> 19:07.443
which I believe
you'll find particularly interesting.

19:10.367 --> 19:13.154
5038.3.

19:13.328 --> 19:16.779
Professor Wilkins
finished his excavation today.

19:16.957 --> 19:19.329
Although whatever civilization
that might have been here

19:19.501 --> 19:22.835
was destroyed
by some natural catastrophe,

19:23.005 --> 19:26.374
it would appear that one of the race
took refuge in the cave.

19:26.550 --> 19:32.838
And for our efforts, we are becoming
only more apprehensive.

19:33.140 --> 19:38.431
As if some unseen force
were influencing us.

19:39.855 --> 19:42.393
- What happened?
- Unknown.

19:47.363 --> 19:49.403
I didn't see you come in, Tommy.

19:49.574 --> 19:52.361
Captain, after we leave here,
can you take us to Marcos Xll?

19:53.494 --> 19:56.282
No, we'll probably take you
to a Federation starbase.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.034
But I have relatives on Marcos Xll.

19:58.208 --> 20:03.333
I'm sorry, Tommy, Marcos Xll
is not within our patrol area.

20:03.505 --> 20:05.462
Mr. Spock,
we'll pursue this in my quarters.

20:05.632 --> 20:09.333
Captain, can I stay here and watch?
I'll be very quiet.

20:11.263 --> 20:12.805
All right, Tommy.

20:12.973 --> 20:16.009
Lieutenant, have Dr. McCoy report
to my quarters for a brief conference.

20:16.185 --> 20:17.679
Mr. Leslie?

20:42.629 --> 20:45.001
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

21:32.305 --> 21:34.048
What is that?

21:37.769 --> 21:40.260
The planet Triacus.

21:40.438 --> 21:42.929
Will we see that
all the time we stay here?

21:43.108 --> 21:44.222
Yes, we will.

21:44.818 --> 21:46.526
All the time we're here.

21:46.695 --> 21:48.937
He sees Triacus on the screen.

21:49.114 --> 21:51.605
He thinks he sees it.

22:03.671 --> 22:05.628
Mr. Sulu, the screen.
We're out of orbit.

22:24.317 --> 22:28.362
- Will we reach Marcos Xll soon?
- Very soon.

23:05.735 --> 23:06.980
When did we change course?

23:08.863 --> 23:10.441
We haven't changed course.

23:10.615 --> 23:12.358
What do you mean,
we haven't changed course?

23:12.533 --> 23:14.360
Look at your Bridge control monitor.

23:14.536 --> 23:16.030
We're still in orbit, sir.

23:16.204 --> 23:19.620
Have you gone completely blind?
That's not orbiting position.

23:19.791 --> 23:21.949
Don't touch the controls, sir.

23:22.127 --> 23:24.250
What the devil
do you think you doing?

23:24.421 --> 23:26.876
We must remain in this orbit
till the Bridge orders a change.

23:27.048 --> 23:28.459
You blind fool.

23:28.633 --> 23:32.252
Can't you see what's in front of you?
We're not in orbit.

23:33.722 --> 23:35.679
I will not disobey
an order from the Bridge.

23:35.849 --> 23:39.514
You are disobeying an order
from the Bridge. Now step aside.

23:40.604 --> 23:43.558
You're losing control of yourself, sir.

23:43.732 --> 23:45.559
Not yet.

24:03.211 --> 24:06.829
I'm being influenced to do things
that do not make sense.

24:07.715 --> 24:10.752
I even went so far
as to call Starfleet Command

24:10.927 --> 24:13.762
to request a spaceship
to be used as a transport.

24:14.931 --> 24:18.135
It was only when I couldn't tell them
what I wanted to transport

24:18.310 --> 24:21.761
that I began to realize
that my mind was being directed.

24:22.272 --> 24:26.400
I decided to send a dispatch
to Starfleet, warning them.

24:27.361 --> 24:30.979
God forgive us.
We must destroy ourselves.

24:31.490 --> 24:35.405
Alien upon us.
The enemy from within.

24:35.578 --> 24:37.535
The enemy!

24:41.959 --> 24:45.293
He never completed the entry.
And the dispatch was never sent.

24:45.463 --> 24:49.377
Except for scenes of family life,
games and picnics with the children,

24:49.550 --> 24:52.041
that is the complete record.

24:52.220 --> 24:55.470
Whatever overwhelmed them must
have done so with incredible speed.

24:55.640 --> 25:00.468
Otherwise the professor would have
provided details of the experience.

25:00.645 --> 25:04.773
He was an excellent scientist
and tireless in his pursuit of the truth.

25:04.941 --> 25:07.267
- That could be what destroyed him.
- Possible, captain.

25:07.444 --> 25:11.524
Evil does seek to maintain power
by suppressing the truth.

25:11.698 --> 25:13.442
Or by misleading the innocent.

25:14.326 --> 25:18.158
Misleading the innocent? I wonder.

25:18.330 --> 25:21.913
Do you mean
the children may be involved?

25:29.008 --> 25:30.917
Yes, doctor.

25:31.093 --> 25:34.628
Spock, what do we know
about the race that lived here?

25:34.805 --> 25:38.221
According to the legend, Triacus
was the seat of a band of marauders

25:38.392 --> 25:41.844
who made constant war
throughout the system of Epsilon Indi.

25:42.021 --> 25:46.767
After many centuries, the destroyers
were themselves destroyed

25:46.943 --> 25:48.817
by those they had preyed upon.

25:48.987 --> 25:50.861
- Is that the end of it?
- No.

25:51.031 --> 25:54.779
Like so many legends,
this one, too, has a frightening ending.

25:54.951 --> 25:58.367
It warns that the evil
is awaiting a catalyst

25:58.538 --> 26:00.365
to set it again into motion

26:00.540 --> 26:03.791
and send it marauding
across the galaxy.

26:05.879 --> 26:11.254
Is it possible
that the evil found the catalyst?

26:11.427 --> 26:14.214
I was speaking of a legend, captain.

26:14.555 --> 26:17.046
But most legends have their basis
in fact, Spock.

26:17.224 --> 26:18.849
I think I read you, Jim.

26:19.018 --> 26:21.057
But as medical officer,
I must warn you

26:21.562 --> 26:27.067
that unless the normal grief is tapped
and released from these children,

26:27.235 --> 26:28.859
you are treading dangerously.

26:29.028 --> 26:32.065
I understand your diagnosis, doctor,
and I will respect it.

26:32.240 --> 26:35.525
But not to the exclusion of the safety
of the Enterprise. Thank you.

26:42.792 --> 26:45.628
Spock, what other expeditions
have visited Triacus?

26:45.795 --> 26:48.631
According to Federation records,
this is the first.

26:49.591 --> 26:52.960
What was it Professor Starnes said
about the unseen force?

26:53.428 --> 26:56.429
He said that an unseen force
was influencing him.

26:56.598 --> 26:59.434
That he recognized it,
was beginning to fight it,

26:59.601 --> 27:02.437
and cancelled his request for a ship.

27:02.938 --> 27:06.141
A ship? Yes. A ship for Triacus.

27:06.317 --> 27:08.938
But why? And by whom?

27:10.946 --> 27:13.438
Security detachment,
ready for relief duty on Triacus.

27:13.616 --> 27:15.609
Assemble to the Transporter Room
immediately.

27:15.785 --> 27:17.861
I'll have some questions
for that planet detachment

27:18.037 --> 27:20.077
as soon as they're beamed up.

27:20.248 --> 27:21.659
I think it's about time we found out

27:21.833 --> 27:25.036
whether Professor Starnes'
enemy within

27:25.211 --> 27:28.545
is on the planet below
or here onboard ship with us.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.330
Come on.

27:44.147 --> 27:46.140
Your tour of duty will last one hour.

27:46.316 --> 27:50.100
Be prepared with your communicators
at all times to report any alien beings.

27:50.279 --> 27:53.315
Don't wait to investigate.
Beam down the guards.

28:01.791 --> 28:05.041
Beam up the security detachment
from Triacus.

28:12.260 --> 28:13.671
Spock.

28:17.182 --> 28:18.344
What's wrong?

28:21.019 --> 28:23.510
I am unable to lock on
to the proper coordinates, captain.

28:23.688 --> 28:24.720
Why not?

28:24.898 --> 28:28.647
It appears
we are no longer orbiting Triacus.

28:29.152 --> 28:31.192
That's impossible.

28:31.363 --> 28:37.567
If we're not orbiting Triacus,
then the men I beamed down are dead.

28:37.744 --> 28:41.160
Captain,
we are no longer orbiting Triacus.

28:41.331 --> 28:43.657
Activate the Bridge monitor screen.

28:53.219 --> 28:57.347
Captain to Bridge.
Mr. Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus.

28:57.849 --> 29:00.137
With all respects, captain,
you're wrong.

29:00.309 --> 29:02.136
I have Triacus on my screen now.

29:02.312 --> 29:04.600
You're off course.
I'm coming right up.

29:04.772 --> 29:08.023
High, high, fire and snow

29:08.193 --> 29:11.727
Call the angel, we will go

29:11.905 --> 29:15.155
Far away, far to see

29:15.325 --> 29:18.445
Friendly angel, come to me

29:18.620 --> 29:21.538
- High, high, fire and snow
- Sulu.

29:21.707 --> 29:24.494
Call the angel, we will go

29:24.668 --> 29:27.835
Far away, far to see

29:28.005 --> 29:30.959
Friendly angel, come to me

29:52.613 --> 29:56.991
Friends, we have reached
a moment of crisis.

29:57.160 --> 30:01.027
The enemy
have discovered our operation.

30:01.206 --> 30:02.866
But they are too late.

30:03.041 --> 30:06.327
They no longer control the ship.
We do.

30:06.795 --> 30:11.421
We shall prevail.
They will take us anyplace we desire.

30:11.591 --> 30:16.300
So back to your stations.
Maintain your controls.

30:16.471 --> 30:19.426
If resistance mounts,
call upon their beast.

30:19.975 --> 30:22.549
Their beast will serve us well.

30:22.728 --> 30:27.224
The fear in each one of them
is the beast which will consume him.

30:27.399 --> 30:29.937
Remember how it was on Triacus?

30:30.111 --> 30:34.108
If they resist,
so shall it be on the Enterprise.

30:34.448 --> 30:38.031
If you need me,
call and I will appear.

30:38.202 --> 30:41.322
Our new goal is Marcos Xll.

30:41.497 --> 30:45.875
It is our new beginning.
We must not falter.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.010
Go to your stations.
Mary, you remain here with me.

31:11.820 --> 31:15.865
Helmsman, disregard
what you see on the screen,

31:16.033 --> 31:18.358
what you think you see
on the screen.

31:18.536 --> 31:20.362
Set a course for Starbase 4.

31:27.461 --> 31:30.000
- Helmsman, do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

31:33.176 --> 31:37.256
Lieutenant Uhura.
Contact Starbase 4.

31:37.430 --> 31:40.004
Tell them
we're bringing the children there.

31:40.183 --> 31:43.884
Tell Starfleet Command
I suspect them of being alien in nature

31:44.646 --> 31:48.097
and I want a thorough investigation
made upon our arrival.

31:48.275 --> 31:50.102
Aye, aye, sir.

32:05.376 --> 32:06.953
Lieutenant?

32:08.879 --> 32:10.457
What are you staring at?

32:10.965 --> 32:12.839
I see my death.

32:15.511 --> 32:20.553
A long death. Disease and pain.

32:21.392 --> 32:23.266
I see my death.

32:23.436 --> 32:25.227
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, there's nothing there.

32:25.396 --> 32:26.428
Oh, God!

32:27.190 --> 32:29.763
Captain, don't let it be.

32:32.487 --> 32:35.274
Mr. Spock,
you make the call to Starfleet.

32:46.627 --> 32:48.785
Mr. Sulu,
I ordered you to change course.

33:00.641 --> 33:01.970
- Mr. Sulu...
- Captain.

33:02.143 --> 33:05.594
Stay away from the controls.
If you touch them, we'll be destroyed.

33:07.023 --> 33:09.311
Mr. Sulu, there's nothing there.

33:11.402 --> 33:14.487
Captain,
why are we bothering Starfleet?

33:23.498 --> 33:25.372
That was an order, Spock.

33:25.542 --> 33:27.499
This Bridge
is under complete control.

33:27.669 --> 33:29.994
- Complete..?
- There is no need.

33:33.050 --> 33:35.042
Take a look around you.

34:08.378 --> 34:11.331
I cannot obey your order, captain.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.449
Take Mr. Sulu to his quarters.
He's relieved of duty.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.640
Mr. Spock...

35:14.821 --> 35:16.316
From the... Confined to quarters...

35:16.490 --> 35:17.688
Did you hear me?

35:20.285 --> 35:21.566
Did you hear me?

35:51.401 --> 35:55.019
Captain, we must get off this Bridge.

35:56.448 --> 36:00.825
Yes, we must. I'm losing command.

36:01.953 --> 36:04.575
I'm losing my ability to command.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.825
I'm losing the Enterprise.

36:10.963 --> 36:13.086
I'm losing command.

36:13.257 --> 36:15.463
I'm losing the Enterprise.

36:15.634 --> 36:18.256
The ship is sailing on and on.

36:20.598 --> 36:22.425
I'm alone.

36:23.309 --> 36:24.969
Alone.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.680
Alone.

36:28.481 --> 36:31.731
- I'm losing command.
- Captain.

36:32.193 --> 36:34.351
I've lost command.

36:34.529 --> 36:36.438
I've lost the Enterprise.

36:41.619 --> 36:43.363
Jim.

36:56.593 --> 36:58.420
I've got command.

37:00.389 --> 37:02.216
I've got command.

37:05.728 --> 37:07.804
I've got command.

37:07.980 --> 37:09.973
Correct, captain.

37:18.491 --> 37:20.318
Where to, captain?

37:20.493 --> 37:23.944
Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend.

37:24.122 --> 37:26.079
This ship is off course.

37:30.670 --> 37:32.295
Scotty.

37:32.922 --> 37:35.211
I want you to override
the Bridge navigation system

37:35.383 --> 37:38.254
- and plot a course for Starbase 4.
- I can't do that, sir.

37:39.429 --> 37:42.347
- Why not?
- These are very sensitive instruments.

37:42.516 --> 37:44.923
I will not have you upset
their delicate balance.

37:45.102 --> 37:47.390
We would all be lost, forever lost.

37:56.447 --> 38:00.231
Go away now.
Go away or we'll kill you.

38:00.409 --> 38:03.327
Scotty. Listen to me.

38:03.496 --> 38:06.616
The Enterprise
has been invaded by alien beings.

38:06.791 --> 38:08.582
Its destination is Marcos.

38:08.751 --> 38:12.167
If we take it there, millions will die
the way they died at Triacus.

38:39.908 --> 38:45.151
No, I'm all right, Spock.
My beast is finished. It won't return.

38:45.331 --> 38:48.415
Captain, so long as the children
are present, there is danger.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.288
They are the carriers.

38:50.461 --> 38:54.625
Spock, they're not the alien beings.
They're children being misled.

38:54.799 --> 38:58.962
They are followers.
Without followers, evil cannot spread.

38:59.136 --> 39:00.381
They're children.

39:00.555 --> 39:04.303
Captain, the 430 men and women
onboard the Enterprise

39:04.642 --> 39:09.470
and the ship itself
are endangered by these children.

39:11.608 --> 39:14.229
They don't understand the evil
that they're doing.

39:14.402 --> 39:16.062
Perhaps that is true.

39:16.237 --> 39:19.737
But the evil that is within them
is spreading fast,

39:19.908 --> 39:22.280
and unless we can find a way
to remove it...

39:23.995 --> 39:25.822
We'll have to kill them.

39:35.382 --> 39:37.339
- Captain Kirk?
- What is it, now?

39:37.509 --> 39:41.210
I have been instructed to place you
and Mr. Spock under arrest.

39:41.806 --> 39:43.964
- By whose order?
- Starfleet Command, sir.

39:45.351 --> 39:48.020
Where did you hear this order,
ensign?

39:55.653 --> 39:59.354
Now listen to me. This order is false.

39:59.532 --> 40:01.572
I want you and your men
to return to their stations.

40:01.743 --> 40:03.570
I'm sorry, captain, but I must insist

40:03.745 --> 40:06.948
you and Mr. Spock come with me
to the detention section.

40:07.123 --> 40:08.701
Ensign, listen to me.

40:16.758 --> 40:19.047
Do not force me to kill you, sir.

40:19.219 --> 40:21.710
I will if I have to.

40:33.401 --> 40:35.477
- Will you come peacefully?
- Ensign, listen to me.

40:35.653 --> 40:37.859
This is a false order, ensign.

40:38.030 --> 40:40.782
I have never disobeyed an order,
captain. You know I have never...

40:40.950 --> 40:43.108
I know that, ensign.
You have never disobeyed an order.

40:43.286 --> 40:45.955
- But an alien being is aboard this ship.
- I will not disobey now.

40:46.122 --> 40:48.613
- I cannot disobey.
- Ensign, you will disobey this order!

40:48.791 --> 40:50.784
Starfleet Command
supersedes your order, sir!

41:12.232 --> 41:13.727
Enough.

41:18.656 --> 41:22.488
Take these men to detention,
then join me on the Bridge.

41:41.179 --> 41:43.006
The Enterprise
will never reach Marcos Xll.

41:43.181 --> 41:44.556
You will not be landed there.

41:44.724 --> 41:46.100
The crew will take us.
They believe.

41:46.267 --> 41:50.645
The crew does not understand.

41:50.814 --> 41:52.723
When we make them understand,
as I understand,

41:52.899 --> 41:54.275
they won't take you to Marcos.

41:54.443 --> 41:55.937
- They will!
- We are going to Marcos!

41:56.111 --> 41:57.771
- We are going to Marcos!
- No, they won't.

41:57.946 --> 42:00.520
- We're gonna follow our friend.
- They will, they will!

42:01.867 --> 42:04.702
Your friend? Where is your friend?

42:04.870 --> 42:07.278
Where is that stowaway?
Why does he hide?

42:07.456 --> 42:09.698
He will come if we call him.

42:09.875 --> 42:13.125
But we won't. We don't need him.
We're not afraid of you.

42:14.463 --> 42:17.037
Good.
I'm glad you're not afraid of me.

42:18.217 --> 42:22.678
But your leader is afraid.

42:22.847 --> 42:25.385
- What's he afraid of?
- He's not afraid of anybody.

42:25.558 --> 42:29.010
- He's not afraid of anything.
- He's afraid to be seen.

42:29.187 --> 42:31.096
And when the crew sees
and hears him,

42:31.272 --> 42:33.645
they'll understand that
he is not their friend.

42:34.401 --> 42:37.022
- And they won't follow him.
- He is our friend.

42:37.195 --> 42:40.196
Then let him show himself.

42:40.365 --> 42:43.568
Bring him out. Let him prove to me
that he is my friend

42:43.744 --> 42:47.113
and I'll follow him to Marcos Xll
and to the ends of the universe.

42:47.289 --> 42:48.831
No.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.876
Mr. Spock, play back the chant

42:56.048 --> 42:58.753
the children sang
to summon up the Gorgan.

43:02.847 --> 43:06.595
Hail, hail, fire and snow.

43:06.767 --> 43:10.101
Call the angel, we will go.

43:10.271 --> 43:13.605
Far away, for to see,

43:13.775 --> 43:17.523
friendly angel, come to me.

43:17.862 --> 43:21.445
Hail, hail, fire and snow.

43:21.616 --> 43:24.736
Call the angel, we will go.

43:24.911 --> 43:27.948
Far away, for to see,

43:28.123 --> 43:31.788
friendly angel, come to me.

43:47.685 --> 43:50.970
The time has come
to see the world as it is.

43:52.273 --> 43:53.815
Come on.

43:58.112 --> 44:01.647
Who has summoned me?

44:01.824 --> 44:06.237
I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone.

44:06.412 --> 44:10.790
It lost its power in the light of reality.
I command again.

44:10.959 --> 44:13.580
And I ordered you here.

44:13.753 --> 44:17.502
No, captain. I command here.

44:17.674 --> 44:21.968
My followers are strong and faithful
and obedient.

44:22.137 --> 44:26.431
That's why we take what is ours
wherever we go.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.972
You take from those
who do not know you.

44:29.144 --> 44:31.469
And we know you.

44:31.647 --> 44:35.514
- Then you know I must win, captain.
- Not if we join together to fight you.

44:35.693 --> 44:39.109
Foolish. You will be destroyed.

44:39.280 --> 44:43.028
I would ask you to join me,
but you are gentle.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.407
And that is a grave weakness.

44:45.578 --> 44:47.155
We are also very strong.

44:47.330 --> 44:50.533
But your strength is cancelled
by your gentleness.

44:50.708 --> 44:54.658
You are full of goodness.
Such as you cannot be changed.

44:54.837 --> 44:59.381
You are like the parents.
You must be eliminated.

45:03.596 --> 45:06.633
Children, I have pictures
of some of you on Triacus.

45:06.808 --> 45:09.216
I'd like to show them to you.
Would you like to see them?

45:10.228 --> 45:12.766
Mr. Spock, the pictures.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.895
I forbid it.

45:16.526 --> 45:17.641
Why should you fear it?

45:17.819 --> 45:20.061
- I fear nothing.
- So we were told.

45:20.239 --> 45:23.193
Mr. Spock, the pictures.
The children are waiting.

45:42.678 --> 45:44.588
I'll get you.

46:05.285 --> 46:06.945
Come on.

46:20.217 --> 46:21.795
I'll get you.

46:36.484 --> 46:40.813
They would not help transport us.
They were against us.

46:41.155 --> 46:43.444
They had to be eliminated.

46:53.543 --> 46:55.500
Tommy's father would have
destroyed you,

46:55.670 --> 46:57.295
but he recognized you too late.

46:58.048 --> 46:59.626
You were also too late.

47:01.093 --> 47:02.836
The kind ones always are.

47:03.303 --> 47:04.881
Not always, Gorgan. Not this time.

47:06.348 --> 47:08.756
You can't hide from them.
They see you as we see you.

47:10.519 --> 47:12.227
They know what you are.

47:15.900 --> 47:19.103
- Even the children learn.
- You are my future generals.

47:19.278 --> 47:23.490
Together we can raise armies
of followers. Go to your posts.

47:23.866 --> 47:26.404
The first great victories are upon us.

47:26.577 --> 47:28.617
You will see.

47:29.122 --> 47:32.787
We have millions of friends
on Marcos Xll.

47:32.959 --> 47:35.913
We shall exterminate
all who oppose us.

47:36.087 --> 47:38.578
Our purity of purpose
cannot be contaminated

47:38.757 --> 47:40.381
by those who disagree,

47:40.550 --> 47:43.220
who will not cooperate,
who do not understand.

47:43.386 --> 47:45.628
They must be annihilated.

47:45.806 --> 47:47.181
Don't be afraid.

47:47.349 --> 47:49.057
Look at him.

47:53.397 --> 47:55.389
Without you children, he's nothing.

47:58.277 --> 48:00.020
The evil remains within him.

48:02.907 --> 48:06.904
I command you. I command you.

48:07.078 --> 48:08.453
To your posts.

48:09.080 --> 48:12.912
Carry out your duties
or I will destroy you.

48:13.084 --> 48:18.291
You will be swept aside
to make way for the strong.

48:19.090 --> 48:23.717
How ugly he really is.
Look at him, and don't be afraid.

48:25.764 --> 48:28.599
Death. Death to you all.

48:28.767 --> 48:30.510
Death to you all.

48:30.685 --> 48:33.889
Death to you all. Death to you all.

48:53.459 --> 48:55.167
It's all right.

48:56.128 --> 48:58.002
They're crying, Jim.

48:58.172 --> 49:00.841
I don't know how it happened,
but it's good to see.

49:02.260 --> 49:04.383
It's all right, Mary. It's all right.

49:04.554 --> 49:06.796
It's all right, isn't it, doctor?

49:06.973 --> 49:09.215
Yes, it's all right.

49:09.392 --> 49:11.550
We can help them now.

49:18.526 --> 49:20.186
Marcos Xll dead ahead, sir.

49:20.362 --> 49:23.398
- Reverse course, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

49:34.710 --> 49:36.833
Course reversed, captain.

49:40.341 --> 49:44.635
- Set course for Starbase 4, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.
