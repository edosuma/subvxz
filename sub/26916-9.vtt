WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:13.040
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.720
After rightfully killing
a turbulent priest,

00:17.480 --> 00:21.360
I made my escape
by threatening the life of the king.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.000
I am now an outlaw
and banished from Winchester.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.520
Alfred is dying,

00:28.600 --> 00:32.200
and to secure the position
of his son Edward as his heir,

00:32.640 --> 00:34.320
he has arranged a marriage.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.040
In his own desire for the crown,

00:38.120 --> 00:41.160
Aethelwold has been found
guilty of treason.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.760
The punishment is blinding.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.800
[screaming]

00:44.880 --> 00:47.800
Does the challenge to Edward
begin here or not?

00:47.880 --> 00:50.160
Edward cannot succeed.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.520
[Uhtred] The Danes
Aethelwold did side with

00:53.000 --> 00:56.720
await Alfred's imminent death
before marching against Wessex.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.800
We have swords in hand
and a battle ahead of us!

00:59.880 --> 01:01.800
[all cheering]

01:01.880 --> 01:04.400
[Uhtred] I have returned
to Winchester in secret,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.000
to seek help for my sister Thyra.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.680
Ragnar's trapped in Niflheim.
Only your blood can save him now.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.200
[Aethelwold] Surround the house.
Do it now.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.200
[Uhtred] Wessex is in greater turmoil
than ever before,

01:15.280 --> 01:18.200
and terror fills the hearts of the people.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.480
[Beocca] My own wife
has dug out a hiding hole.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.640
In fear of her life.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.560
She has been threatened by who?

01:23.640 --> 01:27.000
By people who themselves are afraid
of life without their king.

01:27.560 --> 01:28.760
Uhtred is here.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.400
You can have him executed,
or you can speak with him.

01:32.480 --> 01:38.080
[Uhtred] And so I find myself waiting
for a king at the end of his days.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.160
Destiny is all.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.600
[Alfred] It is a chronicle.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.320
The pages.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.360
It is a chronicle of Wessex.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.320
It will include my life as king...

02:10.960 --> 02:14.000
from the moment
of my brother's death until now.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.720
Songs of a kind.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.680
None of which will mention
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.320
Men will remember what I have done.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.000
But men will die, as we all must.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.360
These pages will remain.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.880
The act of committing ink to parchment
gives a deed permanence.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.840
If it is not burned.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.160
If it is preserved, yes.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.040
And in one hundred years from now,

02:53.120 --> 02:57.600
learned people will read or recite
what is written, and Alfred will appear.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.000
They will know
nothing of the Lord Uhtred...

03:04.080 --> 03:05.160
nor of your...

03:06.720 --> 03:07.680
loyalty...

03:10.400 --> 03:11.360
advice...

03:13.520 --> 03:14.440
bravery...

03:16.440 --> 03:17.520
courage...

03:19.040 --> 03:20.600
and insolence.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.040
Why are you here?

03:34.520 --> 03:35.480
In Winchester?

03:35.560 --> 03:36.960
In this room.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.440
I was told you wished to speak.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.280
Why grant me that wish?
What is it you want from me?

03:44.280 --> 03:48.640
What is it you would say to me,
while I am still able to listen?

03:51.560 --> 03:55.640
If I were to say one thing, it would be
that I could never have killed you.

03:55.720 --> 03:59.400
When I held the knife to your throat,
I could never have taken your life.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.520
I would have beaten you, gladly.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.600
But I would never be the man
who killed Alfred, King of Saxons.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.520
Killing me would have earned you
a place in these pages.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.120
I would not want such a deed written.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.640
Besides, I've earned my place
in these pages.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.480
But every lord is the hero
of his own songs.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.440
I understand my absence.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.280
It will not be written that Alfred
did stand on Uhtred's shoulders.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.200
Many times.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.000
But I know it to be true.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.480
Thank you, Lord.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.280
[Alfred breathing heavily]

04:52.600 --> 04:56.760
Do you believe I could end your life?
You are an outlaw.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.800
It would be written that Alfred,
frail and sick,

05:03.680 --> 05:07.920
did find the strength to slay
the warrior Uhtred Ragnarson.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.680
-That will not happen.
-Because I lack the will?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.120
Because we are bonded.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.240
You cannot kill me,
just as I cannot kill you.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.960
[exhales]

05:35.200 --> 05:37.640
[panting]

05:38.480 --> 05:39.640
My sword is heavy.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.200
I must sit.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.480
There is wine in the jug,
if you would pour it.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.720
For Edward and his bride.
May they be well.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.760
May God protect them.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.200
I say "may God protect them,"
but God often works through men.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.720
He has worked through you in the past.
I know it.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.400
No man alone could break
the shield wall as you did at Ethandun.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.480
I am heathen, Lord.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.920
-You are baptized.
-I believe in the old gods.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.520
[Alfred] The devil, too,
works through men.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.280
My death will bring
the devil in some men to the fore.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.400
Even good men will be tempted
by greed, power, glory, even.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.480
-Christian men?
-Ah, yes.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.920
They sit in my hall as we speak.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.840
They eat my food,
they drink my wine and ale,

06:58.840 --> 07:02.360
and they raise a cup to the happy pair.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.360
[inaudible]

07:03.880 --> 07:05.080
May God help them.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.560
[theme music playing]

07:53.560 --> 07:55.480
[indistinct chatter]

07:56.040 --> 07:57.680
Very well. Good.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.360
Lord Aethelhelm.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.640
May I congratulate you on your new status
as father-in-law to an aetheling.

08:06.760 --> 08:12.960
Should you not cover that wound?
I find it ugly, off-putting.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.800
Oh, you refer to my eye?

08:15.760 --> 08:19.040
I see it as a reminder
of my loyalty to the Crown,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.680
wherever the crown may eventually rest.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.640
The crown will rest on Edward's head.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.160
Mmm, with luck,
but that is just one possibility.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.159
Witans and ealdormen are unpredictable
beasts and we are in uncertain times.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.200
I hope that you are drunk.
You are certainly offensive.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.600
You are not Edward's first father-in-law.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.120
He claims his bastard children
to be legitimate.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.360
Edward has been married once before,
but only the once.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.960
If the bastards were not bastards,
I would know.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.840
[Aethelwold] You should have been told
as you are a most powerful ally.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.320
The children are the result of wild oats.

08:56.400 --> 09:01.040
They are the result of oats sown in love.
Edward's choice of words, apparently.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.560
[Steapa] Lord, I am to remind you
that your place is not at this table.

09:07.760 --> 09:12.760
Agreed, Steapa.
My rightful place is not at this table.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.920
It has been a pleasure
speaking with you, Lord.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.360
Pardon my eye, or, rather, its absence.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.280
There's a sense of unrest
about Winchester.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.840
There is a sense of unrest at this table.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.280
Aldhelm, have a messenger
return to Mercia.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.000
I would like the comfort
of further hearth-guards.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.600
That is not necessary, not at all.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.000
Your father could be lying dead
as we speak and then what would happen?

09:46.280 --> 09:47.680
Aldhelm, the messenger.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.280
Yes, Lord.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.040
The king is where, Beocca? His chamber?

09:53.120 --> 09:55.520
He is resting, Lady. That is all I know.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.080
I shall find him.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.240
He did appear exhausted, Lady.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.360
He never tires of his wife. Never.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.120
You should mention to Lord Aethelhelm
that you fear Uhtred Ragnarson is nearby.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.960
-We do not know if that is true.
-Of course it is true.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.640
If his men are here, Uhtred is here.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.400
He is here for revenge.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.240
That is the truth
we shall continue to tell.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.960
Lord, I would like to understand why
you brought my children to Winchester...

10:37.600 --> 10:40.200
and why you saw fit to have them baptized.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.920
It was done to damn you.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.920
To inflict pain, possibly.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.640
I try to make decisions rationally.

10:51.720 --> 10:56.440
However, taking your children
was not a rational decision.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.680
It was thoughtless. It was selfish.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.320
They have been treated well.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.880
And you are not the best of fathers.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.240
I was not allowed to be their father.
I'm banished.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.200
You killed a man inside this palace.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.440
Though I admit, there was provocation.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.880
And I was wrong in both my judgment
and my punishment.

11:21.960 --> 11:26.520
I did not give you the respect
nor trust that you deserved.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.680
I was afraid.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.480
I am afraid.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.640
Not of you, not of death...

11:38.800 --> 11:41.160
but of losing everything
that Wessex has become,

11:41.240 --> 11:45.600
everything that is written here
in these pages.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.160
My work must continue.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.720
This land must grow.

11:56.480 --> 12:02.720
An England must emerge
and God must be praised.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.200
We are and we remain
the last true Saxon kingdom.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.280
We cannot go on building walls
between the tribes.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.280
Similarly, we cannot be overrun.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.040
That would render my time as worthless.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.400
My father's time, my brothers' time,
it would have all have been wasted.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.440
Lord.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.320
I was told you were resting.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.320
Why is he here?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.600
Uhtred is here at my invitation.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.680
You did say that if he were
to set foot in Wessex once more,

12:41.440 --> 12:42.720
he would be executed.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.280
And now I have other words to say.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.000
If you would leave us,

12:49.080 --> 12:53.440
and if you would say nothing of Uhtred
to our guests, to any man?

12:53.520 --> 12:57.320
I don't understand why you invite
our enemies to eat at our table.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.920
First Aethelwold, and now him.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.920
Lady.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.360
Lord King, there must be
no more forgiveness.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.720
It makes you appear weak.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.600
My dear, you have been invited
to leave us.

13:08.040 --> 13:12.480
And you will do what?
Ask him to stand at Edward's side?

13:12.560 --> 13:13.440
I will decline.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
I will not have it!

13:15.600 --> 13:17.440
Aelswith, you will leave us.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.400
-[door slams]
-[breathes deeply]

13:31.160 --> 13:33.240
She is angry because I am dying.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.640
And that does not make her heartless.
It is her heart that is hurting.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.480
[coughing]

13:50.120 --> 13:51.040
Like me...

13:53.880 --> 13:56.240
like many in Wessex perhaps...

13:58.960 --> 14:00.600
my wife is afraid...

14:03.480 --> 14:04.320
of this.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.200
Of what will be written from this day on.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.200
The uncertainty of what comes next.

14:16.320 --> 14:22.360
What comes next, Lord, is life.
It continues. It always will.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.200
But in which direction? Who will reign?
Which God will be praised?

14:26.280 --> 14:29.200
Which language spoken?
What laws will prevail?

14:29.280 --> 14:33.720
You have had your time.
Soon it will be the turn of others.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.600
God, or the gods...

14:41.320 --> 14:42.400
they will decide.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.440
Agreed.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.080
[breathing heavily]

14:58.080 --> 14:59.080
But...

15:01.800 --> 15:04.480
my last act, for my God,

15:04.560 --> 15:07.200
must be to ensure
that good men hold power.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.840
That is what I must do.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.920
And that is why you are here,
in this room.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.840
[Aelswith] You will not
rush off immediately,

15:27.160 --> 15:30.600
but I would like guards placed
in every corridor of the palace.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.080
The outlaw Uhtred is here.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.640
He is to leave the palace immediately
after leaving the king.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.800
-He'll be dealt with in the days to come.
-Yes, Lady.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.480
[Edward] Mother...

15:49.440 --> 15:50.880
you seem concerned.

15:51.640 --> 15:52.880
Is it the king?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.240
No.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
No.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.880
It is the worry of a celebration,
nothing more.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.160
Soon they will all be drunk and vomiting.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.480
I shall be able to breathe then.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.440
And the truth is what?

16:09.200 --> 16:12.160
The truth is we are living in different
and dangerous times.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.320
You will need all of your resolve.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.200
Smile.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.560
[Alfred] It seems just yesterday...

16:30.240 --> 16:36.400
that I gave Edward over to you
as a dying infant.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.400
I feared my prayers had not been answered,

16:44.920 --> 16:48.640
and I gave him to you...

16:51.160 --> 16:52.280
and to Iseult.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
You remember her.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.400
Always.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.359
Uhtred...

17:17.440 --> 17:20.920
I wish to give over to you my son,
for a second time,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.920
and for the same reason as the first.
To ensure he lives.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.400
Say nothing. Say nothing. Not yet.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.560
All I ask is that you remain in Winchester
until he is crowned king.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.160
Then you can do as you please.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.200
You can go north.
You can reclaim your lands.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.640
I am an outlaw, Lord.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.000
No longer.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.520
You are hereby...

17:51.560 --> 17:52.400
pardoned.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.040
On condition I agree to remain
in Winchester?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.640
You are pardoned
regardless of your decision.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.960
And if beyond that door my wife
has summoned guards, which is likely,

18:12.040 --> 18:13.280
I will dismiss them.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.600
I have made my peace.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.800
I have made my request.
I do not require an answer.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.640
Thank you, Lord...

18:42.280 --> 18:43.960
for correcting your mistake.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.560
I should have closed my eyes and rattled
at Heaven's gates some time ago.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.760
It was the hope of this meeting
that has kept me alive.

19:00.080 --> 19:04.440
To Uhtred, the true Lord of Bebbanburg...

19:09.120 --> 19:14.960
a man I have never understood,
but without whom I would not die a king.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.200
[knock on door]

19:23.640 --> 19:27.560
-[Aethelred] Go away!
-[Aldhelm] Lord, it is Aldhelm.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.400
[Aethelred] What?

19:33.920 --> 19:34.760
What?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.280
Lord, I did not dispatch the messenger.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.080
To summon further guards?

19:43.320 --> 19:45.280
We have a good number of men here,

19:45.360 --> 19:48.040
and sending for more
could suggest aggression, I feel.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.840
You're saying you disobeyed me?

19:49.920 --> 19:52.960
I am giving you counsel, Lord.
Why bring men south now,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.760
when the Danes must be readying
themselves for battle--

19:55.840 --> 19:58.600
You were disobeying me.
Do not dare dress it as counsel.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.160
It is becoming a habit, I have noticed.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.720
As I've noticed your soft eyes
for my wife.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.320
It is counsel, Lord.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.520
Do not fall under her spell.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.640
Bed her, yes,
and give me the satisfaction of divorce,

20:13.720 --> 20:15.000
but do not dare love her!

20:16.000 --> 20:19.040
On the day that Alfred dies,
I shall become King of Mercia,

20:19.120 --> 20:20.240
that very day.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.720
And I shall announce it
here in Winchester.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.080
That is not aggression, that is fact.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.720
You will send for further guards,
50 or more, immediately.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.400
You should be under furs, woman, with me.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.720
[Brida sighs]

20:56.800 --> 21:00.680
War is near and I want to enjoy
all of you while there's time.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.720
[kisses]

21:04.840 --> 21:06.840
You sent Aethelwold to kill Uhtred.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.600
You must have some belief in him.

21:13.080 --> 21:18.960
I sent him to Winchester to sow unrest
and to raise an army of Saxons,

21:19.040 --> 21:22.760
and if the chance arises, kill Uhtred.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.240
Men are saying freely
it was him who killed Ragnar.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.640
Aethelwold? You believe that?

21:37.720 --> 21:41.080
-Is it true?
-Come to bed. Lie with me.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.720
Answer me truthfully. Was it him?

21:44.800 --> 21:47.240
-Truthfully, I do not know.
-[Brida sighs]

21:47.320 --> 21:49.480
But for now, I need Aethelwold alive.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.400
Once he has served his purpose,
I will kill him.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.400
Was it him?

21:56.040 --> 22:00.920
He was in fear of Ragnar.
That is all I know.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.600
Then he's mine to kill.

22:06.760 --> 22:07.640
Only mine.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.480
When battle comes, he must be protected.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.040
-He's mine.
-Very well.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.200
-I'm cold.
-Then go to bed.

22:27.000 --> 22:27.920
I'll follow.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.680
[indistinct chatter]

22:45.240 --> 22:46.080
Dane.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.880
-Say it.
-[Thyra scoffs]

22:49.680 --> 22:50.760
Say you're a Dane.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.320
[chuckles] Dane whore. Say it.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.640
Say it!

22:58.720 --> 23:02.640
I am proud to be a Dane
and to be the wife of a Saxon priest.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.000
I am of two peoples.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.560
"I am of two peoples."
That doesn't make sense.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.880
I wish to live in peace.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.520
You are a Dane... and nothing more.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.080
You will let her pass
or I will have your balls.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.400
Thyra, my apologies.
Tidman's head is hollow.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.160
-My head is fine.
-Yes, it would make a fine bucket.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.800
It was a game.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.720
If you wish to torment her,
then do it where you cannot be seen.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.120
It was a game.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.160
[indistinct chatter]

23:33.680 --> 23:36.960
-[Aethelwold] Uhtred has been pardoned.
-He is in Winchester?

23:37.040 --> 23:40.040
-Did I not say I could smell him?
-What now?

23:42.920 --> 23:45.480
He cannot be allowed
to ally himself to Edward.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.280
One, or preferably both of them, must die.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.920
Edward would be easier to kill.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.280
Outside. Outside, all of you!

23:59.000 --> 24:03.040
Could you not keep control of your tongue?
What you speak of is treachery!

24:03.120 --> 24:07.680
No, it is not treachery, it is the way.
Edward dies, I claim the crown,

24:07.760 --> 24:11.280
we survive the Danes
and Lord Sigebriht counts his silver.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.520
Above all, we survive.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.040
What is required now
is for Alfred to roll over and die.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.000
[Finan] It may be months
before Edward's king.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.840
By then the Danes will be marching.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.760
Alfred will be gone much sooner
even than one month. It will be days.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.440
Then there's the argument,
for want of a better word.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.680
Edward is not
every Saxon's choice for king.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.040
[Finan] Judging by the cackle
in the alehouse,

24:40.120 --> 24:43.440
-Edward is not any man's choice.
-[Uhtred] Men are saying what?

24:43.800 --> 24:47.360
[Sihtric] Edward looks like a woman's arse
and you are here to kill him.

24:47.440 --> 24:51.120
[Beocca] News of your pardon
will change what people say. Thyra?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.440
Thyra... what is it?

24:56.840 --> 24:57.920
Why the tears?

24:59.920 --> 25:02.240
[Uhtred] Maybe you should let me
speak to this man.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.000
I'm quite capable. She's my wife.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.480
-Yes, but you have a temper.
-I do, and it's up.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.440
Tidman!
I'm looking for a rat named Tidman!

25:14.880 --> 25:15.720
Are you Tidman?

25:17.000 --> 25:20.680
-I asked, "Are you Tidman?"
-Father Beocca, good morning.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.120
And Uhtred, free man of Wessex.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.360
I'm looking for a man named Tidman.
Does the coward belong to you?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.640
-He does not.
-I am not a coward.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.080
What is it you want, priest?

25:37.960 --> 25:41.440
What I want, oaf,
is for you to heed my warning.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.480
Speak to or go near my wife again
and I shall beat the shit from you!

25:45.560 --> 25:47.960
-[Aethelwold] Oh, well said.
-It is a promise.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.400
I called your woman a Dane.
Is that... is that not what she is?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.000
Have you not understood me?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.960
You don't appear to be
the cleverest of men.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.160
-Do you speak to me as a man or a priest?
-[groans]

25:59.240 --> 26:02.840
Does that answer your question?
Does that answer your question?

26:03.280 --> 26:06.800
-I do not hide beneath these robes!
-[Uhtred] Beocca, enough! No more!

26:07.520 --> 26:13.840
Bastard! She's a woman!
A gentle woman, and she's suffered enough!

26:16.480 --> 26:18.240
I'm warning you once!

26:22.280 --> 26:23.800
I'm calm. I am calm now.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.880
[all] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Hey!

26:32.680 --> 26:33.600
[Beocca] I'm calm.

26:37.320 --> 26:41.080
This rotten air that fills Winchester
is due to you and the likes of you.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.560
England is a land for all tribes
who wish to settle and live in peace.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.720
Your father would be ashamed of you.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.960
[Uhtred] Go with him.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.560
I fear the priest does not like me.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.160
No man likes you, Aethelwold.
Your soul is as scarred as your face.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.800
Courtesy of my Uncle Alfred in his mercy.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.120
Why are you here?
Do you still dream you can be king?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.240
It is my home and I will not move.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.120
This is a land I love.
Can you say the same?

27:16.200 --> 27:19.160
Ah, Uhtred, I am tired of listening
to this squirrel's arse.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.720
Let me offer you a cup of ale.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.960
Come inside and sit with me.
Let me convince you I am for Wessex.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.520
Hear me.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.640
Please.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.040
Lord Uhtred.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.160
[Uhtred] Lord Sigebriht.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.640
You stand with Aethelwold?

28:02.720 --> 28:06.440
-[Aethelwold] Sigebriht has his own mind.
-I stand for a strong Wessex.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.520
Where exactly do you stand, Lord,
may I ask?

28:11.280 --> 28:12.240
Is it with Edward?

28:13.080 --> 28:15.560
You say it as though
there are men against Edward.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.320
There are men who doubt him, yes.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.680
But if Uhtred were to stand
alongside him--

28:19.760 --> 28:24.840
I was at Ethandun.
I stood beside you in a shield wall.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.400
He is barely a man.

28:26.480 --> 28:30.720
And Alfred could barely lift a sword above
his head, yet he was a man to follow.

28:30.800 --> 28:35.200
I say again, Edward is not Alfred.
He is not a man to follow.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.240
-The Danes know this.
-You're still with them. Admit it.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.800
[Aethelwold] I am for Wessex.

28:39.880 --> 28:44.200
Lord, you did not answer my question.
Where does Uhtred stand?

29:03.520 --> 29:06.080
If he is to stand with Edward, what then?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.920
I have said. They must die.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.280
[choir singing]

29:28.400 --> 29:33.000
I know this is an inopportune moment,
but I must ask.

29:33.800 --> 29:38.600
Why was I not told that Edward
had been married previously?

29:40.560 --> 29:45.360
That his children were born
in this marriage?

29:48.240 --> 29:53.400
Do these children have standing at all?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.160
You were not told, Lord,
because it is unimportant.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.840
The marriage is the past.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.840
The children are bastards,
I can assure you.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.680
Would it not be simpler...

30:06.800 --> 30:10.920
if these children also did not exist?

30:12.560 --> 30:16.200
For Edward and the children that may come.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.080
Perhaps if...

30:23.280 --> 30:27.840
if they were truly
nothing more than rumor?

30:30.640 --> 30:31.920
Something to ponder.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.960
If you would excuse me.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.480
I struggle to understand
the king's thinking.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.960
Why he panders to you is beyond me.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.240
You neither appreciate his trust,
nor deserve it.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.480
The king is a clever man.

31:07.880 --> 31:08.720
You are not.

31:15.040 --> 31:15.920
Lord...

31:18.360 --> 31:20.120
I am not an enemy of the king.

31:22.120 --> 31:26.400
Even if that were true, what you are
is a most dangerous ally.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.880
With Alfred that might be acceptable.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.360
He is more than your equal.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.600
But Edward is not.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.960
And I, for one, shall do my utmost

31:38.040 --> 31:41.440
to keep you as far away
from the boy as possible.

31:41.880 --> 31:45.080
Thank you, Lord.
That would be most appreciated.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.880
Childish...

31:49.280 --> 31:50.280
and reckless.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.320
I have been told, by Aelswith no less,

31:58.400 --> 32:01.240
that you are not to wander
the palace corridors without a guard.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.960
Say it.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.360
-Whatever's on your mind.
-I have no place.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.720
I'm not a husband.
I am not Uhtred of Coccham,

32:16.800 --> 32:18.640
not Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.440
I'm not Uhtred Ragnarson.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.360
I am not even an outlaw anymore.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.560
I would say you're each
and all of those men.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.080
Especially the outlaw,
as you'll never conform. [chuckles]

32:34.640 --> 32:38.040
You'll only follow what you truly believe,
and that is no bad thing.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.240
The only thing you're not is cursed.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.600
You're a free man. Your path is your own.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.640
You have a choice to make, Uhtred.
That is all.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.040
Then I choose you as my greatest friend.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.320
-You are an abbess and a warrior.
-True.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.880
And have I ever mentioned that
you are too good a woman for God alone?

33:06.960 --> 33:10.960
-[chuckles] Once or twice.
-That is true.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.000
The abbess has me shackled, Lady.
I'm her prisoner.

33:19.960 --> 33:23.680
Abbess Hild, be sure to wash your hands.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.920
Winchester is a better place
when you are here.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.320
Know that much.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.560
[all clamoring]

33:42.840 --> 33:44.680
[exclaims]

33:47.000 --> 33:52.640
[Haesten] Cnut! Cnut! Put an end to this
before someone picks up a sword.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.520
Just a little while longer.
They need the taste of blood.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.680
They need use of their limbs.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.440
We need them to fight the Saxons!

34:02.520 --> 34:04.480
Which will be soon, Haesten, my friend.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.520
I can feel it. I can feel it in my balls!

34:08.600 --> 34:09.719
[yelling]

34:14.120 --> 34:16.159
[Cnut] Come here! Come here!

34:34.920 --> 34:35.920
[Uhtred] Lord King.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.560
[Alfred breathing raggedly]

34:46.040 --> 34:47.480
[weakly] Uhtred.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.280
Are you here or is it my sickness?

34:53.320 --> 34:56.040
I wish to tell you
that I will remain in Winchester

34:56.120 --> 34:58.040
until Edward is crowned king.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.160
I swear.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.200
[breathing weakly]

35:28.400 --> 35:31.920
[Aelswith] I intend to show Lord
Aethelhelm the chronicle this evening.

35:33.040 --> 35:33.880
Do you agree?

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
I do.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.760
Invest him in the history of Wessex.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.440
Bind him and his wealth.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.240
Yes.

35:56.440 --> 36:00.000
I have asked Edward to attend,
and his bride.

36:06.640 --> 36:11.960
Lord, forgive me, but there is one matter
that concerns me greatly.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.960
I cannot remain silent.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.040
Uhtred.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.960
What you have done is wrong.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.880
By pardoning the outlaw, you have opened
the door to him becoming Edward's advisor.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.400
I know this is your intention,
but it is wrong.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.720
Necessary.

36:38.680 --> 36:39.920
It is not.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.680
For England, it is necessary.

36:50.400 --> 36:55.800
[Aelswith] Edward cannot be God's king
and England cannot be God's country,

36:55.880 --> 36:58.720
if it is a pagan who guides him and us.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.000
Why are the Danes forever at our door?

37:02.920 --> 37:07.320
Because we are being punished, Lord,
for the presence of this heathen.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.120
He is for England.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.200
[Aelswith] He is an outlaw.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.240
[softly] My England...

37:21.200 --> 37:22.080
my love.

37:24.560 --> 37:28.720
[Aelswith] He is an outlaw.
He must be treated as such.

37:29.600 --> 37:33.920
I will not go against you, Lord.
I could not.

37:35.080 --> 37:39.920
And so I ask you,
rescind what you have done.

37:46.680 --> 37:47.600
Lord King...

37:54.080 --> 37:55.080
[gasps]

38:15.320 --> 38:16.760
[crying]

38:25.800 --> 38:26.880
[Aelswith] Who is it?

38:27.440 --> 38:28.920
It is me, Father Beocca.

38:43.240 --> 38:44.640
[Beocca] He is with God now.

38:45.960 --> 38:50.360
Of that there can be no doubt.
My king is with his God.

38:54.080 --> 38:58.160
He cannot be gone.
His work is not finished.

39:00.040 --> 39:04.080
Where is England?
Where is the one united land?

39:04.160 --> 39:08.960
That was his purpose.
He has work unfinished.

39:09.800 --> 39:14.360
He cannot be gone. God would not allow it.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.560
He will have been comforted
that you were with him, Lady, at the last.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.720
You know of his death,

39:34.040 --> 39:39.520
and I will tell his children,

39:40.320 --> 39:41.360
but that is all.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.160
I do not feel able...

39:47.840 --> 39:50.160
He was loved by the people.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.920
They will want to grieve.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.760
His people must be told.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
I'm afraid.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.560
He's gone.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.960
[Beocca] But his spirit is within us.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.480
We must pray to God
for his help and guidance.

40:13.560 --> 40:17.560
And as Alfred is with God,
he will ensure that we are heard.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.720
He was sickly...

40:22.920 --> 40:24.040
but he was here.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.640
[crying] And now he is not.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.240
I shall...
I shall fetch his children myself.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.040
[Beocca sniffles]

40:44.120 --> 40:48.520
[door opens and closes]

41:08.880 --> 41:10.240
I loved you, Lord King.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.320
Heaven shall be your reward.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.800
And I pray that one day...

41:19.440 --> 41:20.760
we shall meet again.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.920
[praying]

41:53.120 --> 41:55.840
I did not love him for quite some time.

41:58.480 --> 42:01.280
As a young man, he behaved as a young man.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.000
I could not forgive him.

42:06.560 --> 42:10.760
And then, without being aware of why,

42:12.520 --> 42:17.840
I realized that I did love him,
with all my heart and mind.

42:21.560 --> 42:24.360
I saw that he needed me.

42:26.200 --> 42:31.880
I knew that without me he could not
be the king that God demanded.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.240
He has visited the Holy Father, in Rome.

42:38.560 --> 42:39.560
Did you know?

42:40.360 --> 42:41.200
I did.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.560
He was a child then... a baby.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.560
A life passes so quickly.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.640
Edward, you shall fetch Father Beocca.

42:58.560 --> 43:03.840
We shall prepare for the first day
in a new land.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.600
[Aelswith] Father Beocca,

43:17.240 --> 43:21.800
my husband appreciated your loyalty,
advice and your faith in him.

43:22.520 --> 43:23.600
[Beocca] A privilege.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.840
[Aelswith] You have
my most sincere thanks.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.600
[Beocca] An honor, Lady.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.840
Alfred is gone.

43:35.200 --> 43:39.800
You were the king's priest,
and as such, you no longer have a role.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.400
Bishop Erkenwald has agreed
that you may speak at the king's service,

43:46.480 --> 43:49.080
but that must be your final duty
within the palace.

43:50.200 --> 43:53.200
You are bonded with heathens,
Father Beocca.

43:54.480 --> 43:59.000
Edward must be God's king.
Bishop Erkenwald agrees.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.560
Which heathens would they be, Lady?

44:04.800 --> 44:06.880
My wife's Christian. She's been baptized.

44:08.160 --> 44:12.920
You are, and you shall always be,
a protector of Uhtred.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.640
Uhtred does not need my protection.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.600
You are bonded with heathens.

44:18.480 --> 44:21.600
Edward must look to God and only to God.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.120
You will tell your friend Uhtred
that his pardon is to be rescinded.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.280
But the letter is written
in the king's hand.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.120
He must leave Winchester
or I shall have him taken.

44:32.240 --> 44:36.880
A man cannot threaten to kill a king
and go unpunished.

44:43.920 --> 44:44.760
[Beocca] Lady!

44:47.000 --> 44:50.400
For my part, I do not care if I serve God
in the palace of Winchester

44:50.480 --> 44:52.120
or the middle of a barren field.

44:53.240 --> 44:57.920
But in rescinding a royal pardon,
I fear you're making a mistake.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.640
The Danes will hear about it
and it will embolden them.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.040
And your son Edward
is not yet a commander.

45:06.840 --> 45:10.680
If God is with us, then we shall win.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.680
I will not leave Winchester, I cannot.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.960
-You can and you must.
-Not until Edward is king.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.480
You promised Alfred this?

45:30.520 --> 45:31.440
I did.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.160
[Finan] If the pardon does not hold,

45:34.240 --> 45:37.280
then you cannot stay
and wait to be imprisoned and killed.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.720
[Thyra] Where should he go?

45:38.800 --> 45:41.480
Anywhere a horse can take him.
Anywhere a ship can go.

45:41.560 --> 45:45.080
Uhtred came here for a reason.
He came for Ragnar's blood.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.760
He has a task to fulfill.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.640
The blood must be kept safe.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.640
A battle is coming.
You must choose a side.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.200
The problem being
is neither side wants him.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.200
[chuckles]

46:00.280 --> 46:03.800
Which is a further reason
why you must stay. Wait for Edward.

46:04.920 --> 46:08.200
Which is why Alfred asked you
for what seemed a simple promise.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.560
Bastard thinks.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.920
He knows your honor, Uhtred. That is all.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.880
[choir singing]

47:18.080 --> 47:20.160
You should not be here, Dane.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.240
[Beocca] The king is dead.

47:27.320 --> 47:32.400
So together we pray for his soul,
and for his successor, Edward.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.360
May God guide and protect him always.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.800
May God surround him
with strength and wisdom.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.280
-Amen.
-[all] Amen.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.320
[singing continues]

47:50.560 --> 47:54.560
[Steapa] Lord, I have orders to kill you,
should you not leave the hall quietly.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.000
[singing continues]

48:24.920 --> 48:29.240
[Finan] Steapa, what is this?
Hmm? What is this?

48:30.760 --> 48:33.560
Finan, do nothing.

48:34.160 --> 48:35.200
He's a free man.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.480
[rock thuds]

48:54.280 --> 48:56.280
Do not think I am afraid of you.

49:01.080 --> 49:02.280
-[rock thuds]
-[gasps]

49:33.000 --> 49:34.040
[panting]

49:47.840 --> 49:49.800
[thudding on door]

49:49.880 --> 49:52.560
[Tidman] Are you rejoicing
at the king's death, bitch?

49:53.480 --> 49:54.520
-[thud]
-[gasps]

50:03.640 --> 50:06.120
-[thudding continues]
-[whimpers]

50:42.080 --> 50:43.920
[footsteps approaching]

50:51.360 --> 50:53.040
[floorboard creaks]

51:12.040 --> 51:14.080
[footsteps approaching]

51:40.080 --> 51:41.480
[whimpering]

51:43.960 --> 51:50.240
That is where you belong,
in a hole, in the ground.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.520
[laughing]

51:56.840 --> 51:58.040
[choking]

52:16.960 --> 52:20.480
[thudding]

52:22.720 --> 52:24.080
[grunting]

52:25.000 --> 52:26.280
[Thyra] Beocca!

52:27.440 --> 52:29.960
Help! Help me!

52:31.120 --> 52:32.320
Beocca!

52:35.040 --> 52:36.000
Please!
