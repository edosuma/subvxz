04:35.223 --> 04:37.469
Good morning, sinners.

04:37.594 --> 04:40.734
I can say that because
I'm a sinner, too.

04:40.999 --> 04:43.947
I know the dark path
of drink and debauchery.

04:44.072 --> 04:45.416
I traveled it well.

04:45.541 --> 04:48.889
Yeah, but now I'm on
the path to God's light.

04:49.207 --> 04:50.710
And I invite every last
one of you to come along.

04:50.876 --> 04:52.212
All are welcome.

04:52.378 --> 04:55.335
Black, white, sinner or Saint.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.596
Even you papists.

04:57.763 --> 04:59.350
All are welcome in God's house.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.614
Thank you, Father.
I mean, Reverend.

05:03.151 --> 05:05.854
I'm glad our dear sweet
mother wasn't here to see that.

05:05.979 --> 05:08.074
What?
Just being polite.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.963
Why you always on me arse?

05:11.088 --> 05:15.770
The house was half-full last night.

05:15.895 --> 05:17.974
Be half again tomorrow.

05:18.099 --> 05:20.178
What do you want me to do about it?

05:20.303 --> 05:23.851
Worry about it like I do.

05:23.976 --> 05:25.313
The Swede will
come calling, you know,

05:25.479 --> 05:28.401
sooner rather than later.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.696
That must be the new girl.

05:30.821 --> 05:32.200
The savage one.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.501
What do you mean?

05:33.626 --> 05:35.037
Haven't ya heard?

05:35.162 --> 05:37.642
Mr. Toole told me the whole story.

05:37.767 --> 05:40.715
She was but a girl, white as we,

05:40.840 --> 05:42.093
taken captive years ago.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.223
Sold to the highest
Heathen bidder, she was.

05:45.348 --> 05:48.162
Some say she was a slave.

05:48.287 --> 05:52.002
Others claim she be
an Indian princess.

05:52.127 --> 05:54.114
Would you stop with your tall tales.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.950
She's just a whore, Mick.

05:56.117 --> 05:57.787
Well, then go talk
to her, you bastard.

05:57.953 --> 06:00.000
Make me a liar.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.336
Go on.

06:09.690 --> 06:11.019
Ahem.

06:16.202 --> 06:17.530
Good morning to ya.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.541
He buy the man a drink
first, that's what I hear.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.472
He buy the man a drink,

06:49.597 --> 06:50.875
take him out and goes savage
as a meat axe on him.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.092
You hear me?

06:52.258 --> 06:54.280
He didn't kill Johnson.

06:54.406 --> 06:55.640
They was gonna hang him.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.820
They didn't.

06:57.945 --> 06:59.414
Yet.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.648
Good day, Mr. Bohannon, sir.

07:12.773 --> 07:14.342
A fine day, is it not?

07:15.712 --> 07:17.924
Fine or not...

07:18.049 --> 07:21.597
Guess we got a good
day's work ahead of us.

07:21.722 --> 07:24.149
Mr. Kretschmar...

07:24.315 --> 07:27.821
I need that rail-end leveled
down to the next marker.

07:27.988 --> 07:32.315
Mr. Toole, I need you and your men
down at the end of the iron.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.884
Looks like the train's bringing down

07:34.009 --> 07:35.353
that load of ties, all right?

07:35.478 --> 07:36.815
Yes, sir, Mr. Bohannon, sir.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.294
Elam, I need you and your men...

07:39.419 --> 07:41.088
It's Mr. Ferguson.

07:45.163 --> 07:46.813
Elam...

07:49.567 --> 07:51.322
You and your men get down to the cut.

07:53.699 --> 07:57.040
I need men...

07:57.206 --> 07:59.796
Men not afraid of the Heathens,

07:59.921 --> 08:03.927
men not afraid of making some money.

08:05.298 --> 08:07.344
What is this about?

08:07.469 --> 08:11.785
The fair-haired maiden of the West.

08:11.910 --> 08:16.626
Mrs. Lily Bell,
she has been taken captive

08:16.751 --> 08:19.699
by the Cheyenne dog soldiers.

08:19.825 --> 08:22.794
A Mr. Durant has promised a bounty

08:22.960 --> 08:25.042
to the men who rescue her.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.301
Ain't nobody going nowhere's...

08:27.467 --> 08:30.724
Or there won't be a job waiting
for you when you get back.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.395
Dix will take a party
North, Bolan, South.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.782
You... you...

08:39.948 --> 08:41.070
You.

08:41.195 --> 08:43.375
I told you.
I can't spare these men.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.085
Mr. Durant wants her found.

08:46.251 --> 08:48.381
Mr. Durant wants a railroad built.

08:51.112 --> 08:52.957
You and you.

08:53.082 --> 08:54.292
No, this ain't happening.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.687
Boss man, let 'em go.

08:58.857 --> 09:01.463
We can do their work and our work.

09:05.303 --> 09:08.041
You get your men and you
get the hell out of here.

09:17.325 --> 09:20.395
One more thing...

09:20.562 --> 09:22.443
I'm looking for a man named Harper,

09:22.568 --> 09:27.075
Frank Harper,
he's a friend of Johnson's.

09:27.241 --> 09:29.523
I got something for him.

09:29.649 --> 09:31.874
I believe he's out
with the logging crew.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.998
Where's that?

09:34.123 --> 09:37.529
Oh, must be 15, 20 miles
West of the cut by now.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.732
Is that a bullet?

09:45.898 --> 09:47.193
What?

09:47.359 --> 09:49.884
What you got for sergeant Harper?

09:52.155 --> 09:55.542
Ain't you got some work to do...

09:55.708 --> 09:57.965
Yours and theirs?

09:59.235 --> 10:00.880
Get to it.

10:12.826 --> 10:15.540
The people, they are scared.

10:15.665 --> 10:18.332
The Indian massacre.

10:18.498 --> 10:20.649
They seen the bodies,

10:20.774 --> 10:23.420
heard the stories, your stories.

10:23.545 --> 10:25.758
I need troops.

10:25.883 --> 10:28.162
7 men we lost last night.

10:28.287 --> 10:30.269
Left the employ of the Union Pacific,

10:30.436 --> 10:32.370
some on the train,
others just run off.

10:32.495 --> 10:34.874
More tonight, I'd expect.

10:34.999 --> 10:39.049
Seems the men prefer to keep
their scalps on their heads.

10:39.174 --> 10:40.952
Are you afraid?
No, sir, Mr. Du...

10:41.077 --> 10:42.255
What about you?

10:42.380 --> 10:43.791
Well, as a matter of fact, I...

10:43.916 --> 10:47.898
Enough. Now, why do you
wanna s on my railroad?

10:48.023 --> 10:51.738
Uh, well, under our current pace,

10:51.863 --> 10:54.062
uh, we won't make the 40-mile mark.

10:54.228 --> 10:55.412
So, what I would, uh,

10:55.537 --> 10:58.361
propose is we straighten the route.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.557
The route remains the same.

11:01.682 --> 11:03.393
But Mr. Durant, as I understand it,

11:03.518 --> 11:04.996
the deadline has been pushed up.

11:05.121 --> 11:06.833
And in light of Central Pacific's
recent advances...

11:06.958 --> 11:09.638
Keep to the plan.
I'll make it a reality.

11:09.763 --> 11:12.033
Yes, sir, Mr. Durant.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.687
You're amused?

11:17.853 --> 11:19.389
No, sir.

11:19.514 --> 11:22.795
I'm just looking forward
to watching yet again

11:22.920 --> 11:27.637
as you smite the forces agin you.

11:27.762 --> 11:29.666
The search continues?

11:29.832 --> 11:31.902
For the maps?

11:33.405 --> 11:35.677
For the woman, Lily Bell.

11:35.843 --> 11:40.686
I've got my men
out despite Mr. Bohannon.

11:40.852 --> 11:43.999
Still more concerned about
your killer than my railroad?

11:44.124 --> 11:45.301
No, sir.

11:45.426 --> 11:47.973
But whoever cut
Daniel Johnson's throat

11:48.099 --> 11:50.044
is an ongoing concern.

11:50.169 --> 11:54.442
More importantly,
is my new foreman building my railroad?

11:55.612 --> 11:57.090
He is.

11:57.215 --> 12:01.064
Yet there is something about the man

12:01.189 --> 12:03.669
that does not quite add up.

12:03.794 --> 12:08.210
To... Jordan Crane, Washington, D.C.

12:08.335 --> 12:11.950
Stop.
Honorable Senator.

12:12.075 --> 12:15.498
Work continues at a fever pace. Stop.

12:15.714 --> 12:20.731
However, hostile native
action threatens progress.

12:20.856 --> 12:24.804
Stop. The march of
civilization in jeopardy.

12:24.929 --> 12:26.941
Stop.

12:27.066 --> 12:31.148
To heal the nation we
must displace the savage.

12:31.273 --> 12:32.550
Stop.

12:32.675 --> 12:36.757
Otherwise, the savage
will displace us.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.283
Mrs. Bell?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.290
Mrs. Bell?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.865
Whoa, boy.

13:08.942 --> 13:10.470
You speak English?

13:10.636 --> 13:11.805
Yes, sir.

13:11.971 --> 13:14.617
Move.

13:22.766 --> 13:24.244
Who are you?

13:24.369 --> 13:26.047
Joseph Black Moon.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.482
You Cheyenne?

13:27.607 --> 13:28.627
Christian.

13:28.843 --> 13:31.824
Whoa, whoa.

13:31.949 --> 13:33.219
Hold steady.

13:33.385 --> 13:36.531
I'm unarmed, sir.

13:36.656 --> 13:37.799
What did you do to her?

13:37.924 --> 13:39.436
I... I didn't...

13:39.561 --> 13:41.773
Hey. What did you do to her?

13:41.899 --> 13:43.509
I saved her.

13:43.634 --> 13:45.279
From the Indians?

13:45.404 --> 13:46.784
Yes, sir.

13:46.950 --> 13:49.219
She took an arrow to the shoulder.

13:49.344 --> 13:53.182
I'm trying to take her to
the railroad to see the doctor.

14:07.344 --> 14:08.865
When this happen?

14:09.031 --> 14:10.325
2, maybe 3 days ago.

14:10.492 --> 14:12.529
All right.

14:12.654 --> 14:15.224
My horse, there's a field
kit in the saddle bag.

14:23.724 --> 14:26.062
Here.

14:26.228 --> 14:28.880
Hold her down.

14:47.391 --> 14:49.312
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

14:49.478 --> 14:51.065
Hold her down.

14:55.761 --> 14:56.825
Hey, shh. Stop!

14:57.097 --> 14:58.787
Stop it!

15:11.350 --> 15:13.791
Hold on.

15:17.564 --> 15:19.734
Ohh! Ohh!

15:41.988 --> 15:46.651
Now, the man say we gotta
do our work and theirs.

15:46.776 --> 15:53.508
Ha! But I ask ya, why ain't
that negro ass down here with us?

15:53.674 --> 15:55.971
Y'all know who he is,
that's all I'm saying.

15:56.137 --> 16:00.408
Back in the day...
Them days was bad.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.274
Don't get me wrong.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.487
Massah drove me hard.

16:04.653 --> 16:07.753
Nearly drove me to the grave.

16:07.878 --> 16:09.829
You hear me?

16:09.995 --> 16:11.624
Some things was better back then.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.263
At least you knew your place.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.922
Psalms!

16:15.088 --> 16:18.430
Less talk, more work.

16:22.977 --> 16:24.785
Bust me some stone, negro.

16:25.106 --> 16:26.693
How 'bout I bust me your head?

16:30.722 --> 16:32.494
You got something to say to me?

16:32.660 --> 16:33.663
Yes, I do.

16:33.829 --> 16:36.107
What would that be?

16:36.232 --> 16:39.045
How come we got to do
the white man work, huh?

16:39.171 --> 16:43.420
Oh, that's right, 'cause you
think you is the white man,

16:44.139 --> 16:47.146
not the high yellar house n you is.

17:08.432 --> 17:12.900
We got to do their work and our work.

17:13.066 --> 17:16.740
But this ain't for them.

17:16.906 --> 17:18.652
This is for us.

17:18.777 --> 17:21.874
White man ain't gonna
give you nothin'

17:22.040 --> 17:25.505
because they want us to fall.

17:25.671 --> 17:28.157
They all want us to fall.

18:19.851 --> 18:23.734
Hey.

18:23.859 --> 18:26.279
Sir? Are you leaving?

18:26.445 --> 18:29.285
Yeah. Somewheres I gotta be.

18:29.451 --> 18:32.373
Thank you for helping her.

18:32.539 --> 18:35.046
Yep.

18:42.892 --> 18:44.662
Whoa.

18:48.903 --> 18:50.338
Damn it.

18:55.648 --> 18:58.294
You ain't thought this
thing through, have you?

18:58.460 --> 18:59.838
What do you mean?

19:00.004 --> 19:02.135
Indian brings that
woman back to town,

19:02.260 --> 19:05.206
Indian don't get out alive.

19:05.331 --> 19:09.079
But I live there, at the church.

19:09.204 --> 19:10.775
You don't get it, do ya, boy?

19:10.941 --> 19:14.615
They brought them back in
yesterday on a buckboard.

19:14.781 --> 19:16.717
Everybody's seen what
they did to them bodies.

19:18.489 --> 19:21.168
Why cut 'em up?

19:21.293 --> 19:23.171
Huh?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.309
What do you people get out of it?

19:25.434 --> 19:27.430
Your people have done much worse.

19:29.308 --> 19:30.944
Yeah, maybe...

19:32.582 --> 19:35.495
Maybe.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.766
But I ain't gonna keep 'em

19:37.891 --> 19:39.035
from skinning your ass alive,

19:39.160 --> 19:42.497
you bring that white
woman back to town.

19:48.341 --> 19:50.644
I'll have to take her.

20:18.063 --> 20:21.209
Explain to me how
I work harder than them

20:21.334 --> 20:24.615
and they go to bed with 3 more
dollars in their pocket than I do.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.684
That don't make a lick of sense.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.020
Well, it don't.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.190
We work as hard as them, right?

20:30.315 --> 20:32.695
Damn right.

20:32.820 --> 20:36.659
Then why don't we get
the same reward?

20:38.697 --> 20:40.350
You crazy.

20:40.516 --> 20:42.961
We deserve a taste, too.
Huh?

20:43.521 --> 20:45.151
We can't go in there.

20:45.317 --> 20:48.489
You ain't one of them
Nancy boys, is you, psalms?

20:48.614 --> 20:50.125
Now, I know you get horny,

20:50.251 --> 20:51.954
I hear you back behind
that tent every night.

20:53.256 --> 20:56.336
Damn, boy, you gonna go blind.

20:58.098 --> 20:59.221
Heh heh heh.

20:59.346 --> 21:02.014
Look here, you go in there,

21:02.139 --> 21:04.560
you coming out on
the bad end of a rope.

21:05.746 --> 21:07.732
You ain't scared, is ya?

21:07.898 --> 21:09.986
You're damn right I'm scared.

21:10.152 --> 21:13.325
Well, I ain't.

21:40.010 --> 21:44.463
Just what do you want,

21:44.630 --> 21:48.501
Spend some hard earned

21:48.626 --> 21:49.974
Same as me, he says.

21:50.140 --> 21:54.545
Have ya looked in the mirror
lately, Mr. Ferguson?

21:54.670 --> 21:57.384
You think we the same, well then,

21:57.510 --> 21:59.755
you got a big surprise
coming, I tell ya.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.893
Face like a coal scuttle he has.

22:02.018 --> 22:04.666
Why don't you just mind
your damn business?

22:04.832 --> 22:06.736
You the man to make me?

22:06.861 --> 22:10.844
Well, if it ain't Mr. Toole.

22:10.969 --> 22:14.726
Watch out, ladies, he's back.

22:14.892 --> 22:18.157
We call him the Blade,

23:42.598 --> 23:44.276
Where's Joseph?

23:44.401 --> 23:45.545
He took off.

23:45.670 --> 23:46.814
Why?

23:46.939 --> 23:50.287
Ma'am, it is way
too late and way too wet

23:50.412 --> 23:54.018
to be trying to figure out
some Indian, all right?

23:55.788 --> 23:59.737
I regret we haven't
been properly introduced.

23:59.862 --> 24:01.941
Cullen Bohannon.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.137
I work for the railroad.

24:16.425 --> 24:18.403
Have I done something?

24:18.529 --> 24:22.511
It ain't what you
done, it's who you are.

24:22.636 --> 24:24.121
What do you mean?

24:26.042 --> 24:29.156
You ain't whore nor squaw.

24:29.281 --> 24:30.916
You shouldn't be out here.

24:32.788 --> 24:37.896
You don't know who I am
or what I'm capable of.

24:38.062 --> 24:40.532
No, I don't, and I sure
as hell don't care.

25:03.207 --> 25:07.412
Request for military support
to be taken under advisement.

25:09.184 --> 25:14.067
Very concerned regarding
lack of progress.

25:14.193 --> 25:19.911
Need to understand
impact of surveyor loss.

25:20.036 --> 25:22.982
Hmm.

25:23.107 --> 25:27.624
The honorable Senator
is very concerned.

25:27.749 --> 25:33.077
If he were in my shoes,
he'd be downright suicidal.

25:33.243 --> 25:36.305
Ahh.

25:36.430 --> 25:38.943
Damn.

25:39.068 --> 25:41.838
Henri?

25:55.329 --> 25:57.608
Your look of disdain reminds me

25:57.733 --> 25:59.916
of my dear wife back in New York.

26:01.907 --> 26:07.928
What Hannah failed to
grasp is that where most

26:08.053 --> 26:13.806
men seek the warm glow that
only whisky can provide,

26:13.931 --> 26:19.084
I imbibe to fuel a conflagration.

26:19.209 --> 26:24.359
There's a fire in my belly
which must be fed.

26:24.484 --> 26:27.890
Otherwise, we'll
never see the Pacific.

26:34.770 --> 26:38.150
And... did your wife accept

26:38.276 --> 26:39.945
this excuse, Monsieur Durant?

26:40.111 --> 26:43.551
As a matter of fact, she didn't.

27:10.266 --> 27:11.377
Ahh.

27:35.378 --> 27:39.027
Sorry, mate, uh, you missed
the last show, I'm afraid.

27:39.152 --> 27:42.366
Oh, very well. I see.

27:42.491 --> 27:47.241
Mr. Durant, sir,
an honor and a pleasure.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.146
This is quite
an establishment you've got here.

27:50.271 --> 27:52.050
I'm only sorry you're
closed for the night.

27:52.175 --> 27:54.220
The next show begins
at dusk tomorrow.

27:54.345 --> 27:55.829
Quiet, you daft bastard.

27:55.996 --> 27:58.894
This is Thomas "Doc" Durant.

27:59.019 --> 28:01.999
A private view he'll be having.

28:02.124 --> 28:03.736
Thank you.

28:03.861 --> 28:04.971
Ah, how much?

28:05.137 --> 28:06.807
Ah, that will be 5...

28:06.973 --> 28:08.243
Dollars.

28:08.368 --> 28:12.541
The going rate...
For a private show.

28:18.552 --> 28:20.832
Mickey, show time!

28:27.768 --> 28:31.383
I have followed your exploits

28:31.508 --> 28:35.858
and investments since
I got off the boat.

28:35.984 --> 28:38.864
How you rose up from nothing,

28:38.989 --> 28:42.337
pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps.

28:42.463 --> 28:46.479
You're a gentlemen
and a true capitalist.

28:46.604 --> 28:48.772
Thank you.

28:53.306 --> 28:56.495
Hmm.

28:56.620 --> 29:01.446
I assume you two are immigrants
from this beautiful country?

29:01.729 --> 29:03.374
Aye.

29:03.499 --> 29:06.780
From county Wicklow, to be exact.

29:06.905 --> 29:09.460
We left our sweet mother
and 4 brothers

29:09.627 --> 29:12.883
and set out for the new
world to seek our fortune.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.890
You left a beautiful life

29:17.056 --> 29:22.609
to come and wallow in this
filth and squalor and muck.

29:22.734 --> 29:25.071
Well, it beats starving to death.

29:25.238 --> 29:28.420
No, but you could have remained

29:28.545 --> 29:30.324
in New York or Boston or Chicago.

29:30.449 --> 29:32.000
There's plenty of work to be had.

29:32.166 --> 29:37.404
Yet you chose to come here.

29:37.529 --> 29:40.056
It makes me wonder why.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.526
I'm not quite sure
what you mean, sir.

29:46.692 --> 29:50.595
Well, you and thousands like you

29:50.720 --> 29:56.339
have followed me out here,
and I'm genuinely curious.

29:56.464 --> 29:57.629
Why?

29:57.795 --> 30:01.548
Well, sir, um...

30:01.673 --> 30:04.519
It seemed a proper investment

30:04.644 --> 30:07.604
of our time and efforts.

30:07.770 --> 30:09.560
That's not it at all.

30:09.685 --> 30:12.665
I remember it well...
Like it was yesterday.

30:12.790 --> 30:14.158
What are you talking about?

30:14.325 --> 30:15.703
What is it you remember?

30:16.096 --> 30:22.048
Ahem. We were just lads, me and Sean,

30:22.173 --> 30:24.084
never been much further afield

30:24.209 --> 30:27.849
than the bitter land our father worked,
God rest him.

30:28.015 --> 30:31.522
And one day, we heard the whistle.

30:31.688 --> 30:37.565
And it was the Dublin
special on its daily run.

30:38.802 --> 30:42.959
Well, we jumped the steaming bastard.

30:43.125 --> 30:45.958
It took us all the way to the city.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.528
Ha ha ha.

30:47.653 --> 30:51.702
Yes, I remember.

30:51.828 --> 30:54.438
I never felt so free.

30:54.604 --> 30:57.443
The railroad, it gave you freedom.

30:57.609 --> 30:59.586
Aye.

30:59.711 --> 31:05.290
And our father...
Gave us the whipping of a lifetime.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.307
I prayed you'd stay away, my son.

31:38.474 --> 31:42.398
This is my home.

31:42.564 --> 31:44.628
It's not a very safe one right now

31:44.753 --> 31:48.491
for one born out of the Grace of God.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.288
But I'm baptized, Father.

31:51.455 --> 31:55.128
Yeah, well, that does not always sway

31:55.295 --> 31:57.943
the cruel prejudice of others.

32:04.457 --> 32:06.335
It's not your fault.

32:06.460 --> 32:07.904
But it is.

32:08.029 --> 32:10.697
They were from my band.

32:10.864 --> 32:15.742
Our dog soldiers,
they're the ones that did this.

32:17.179 --> 32:20.127
Your family had nothing
to do with this.

32:20.252 --> 32:24.266
I recognize the arrows, Father.

32:24.391 --> 32:26.935
It was my brother.

32:32.205 --> 32:33.947
You must tell no one.

32:34.114 --> 32:37.023
Never speak of this again.

32:37.148 --> 32:39.624
But it's the truth.

32:41.857 --> 32:43.423
Never.

33:30.711 --> 33:34.554
Well, there you are, kitty cat.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.475
What do you want?

33:36.641 --> 33:38.398
Oh, we want you.

33:38.523 --> 33:40.402
We've been searching
over hill and Dale

33:40.527 --> 33:43.111
for the fair-haired
maiden of the West.

33:43.277 --> 33:45.114
We come to rescue ya.

33:45.503 --> 33:47.369
Thank you, no.
I'm quite all right.

33:47.535 --> 33:48.871
No, you ain't.

33:49.037 --> 33:51.626
You barely escaped massacre.

33:51.793 --> 33:53.959
You've been held captive.

33:54.084 --> 33:56.530
You've been sullied by the Heathen.

33:56.655 --> 33:58.180
You're out of order, sir.

33:58.346 --> 33:59.637
Listen, you ain't come with us,

33:59.762 --> 34:02.646
we ain't get compensated.

34:02.812 --> 34:09.178
Oh, yeah, there's a bounty on
your head now, 100 gold eagles.

34:10.784 --> 34:12.329
Go ahead.

34:17.259 --> 34:20.219
Easy now, girl.
You just take it easy.

34:20.385 --> 34:22.010
Stay back.
Easy now.

34:22.135 --> 34:23.746
Stay back!

34:23.871 --> 34:26.103
Now, you making this a lot more
unpleasant than it has to be.

34:35.453 --> 34:36.993
Aah!

34:38.123 --> 34:39.797
Uhh!

34:42.299 --> 34:43.737
Uhh!

34:52.320 --> 34:54.089
Mrs. Bell!

34:55.257 --> 34:57.025
Damn it.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.142
Come on!

35:03.471 --> 35:05.049
My ear!

35:05.174 --> 35:06.886
My ear! My ear!

35:07.011 --> 35:08.512
Where is it?

35:09.649 --> 35:12.720
Whoa. Whoa, hold up there.

36:05.988 --> 36:09.326
Death is no stranger
to this God-forsaken place.

36:12.333 --> 36:16.549
Death abides in the hard
labor of a rail gang

36:16.675 --> 36:19.288
or the searing heat
of a prairie fire.

36:19.413 --> 36:23.019
Death abides at the bottom
of a whisky bottle

36:23.186 --> 36:24.699
or at the smoking end of a gun.

36:25.064 --> 36:27.704
There's death by famine, flood,

36:27.829 --> 36:30.042
or pestilence, and
a thousand other ways.

36:30.167 --> 36:31.827
But yes, brothers,

36:31.993 --> 36:37.011
death abides and he will
reap his dark harvest.

36:40.152 --> 36:45.102
But must we be death's accomplice?

36:45.227 --> 36:48.565
Must we do his bidding?

36:50.804 --> 36:54.519
I know that your
hearts seek vengeance

36:54.644 --> 36:58.127
for the deaths of
those men, I know that,

36:58.252 --> 37:03.370
but haven't we had our fill of war,

37:03.716 --> 37:07.056
our fill of killing,
the shedding of blood?

37:16.652 --> 37:19.267
And they will hammer their swords

37:19.392 --> 37:21.461
into plowshares...

37:23.666 --> 37:27.749
And their Spears into pruning hooks.

37:28.051 --> 37:31.288
Nations will not lift up
swords against nations.

37:31.598 --> 37:37.656
And never again will
they learn war. Never again.

37:39.488 --> 37:45.871
Isaiah, chapter 2, verse 4.

37:48.109 --> 37:50.454
Wake up the mighty men,

37:50.579 --> 37:54.229
let all the men of war draw near.

37:54.354 --> 37:58.403
Hammer your plowshares into swords

37:58.528 --> 38:02.171
and your pruning hooks into Spears.

38:04.672 --> 38:06.787
Job, chapter 3, verse 10.

38:06.953 --> 38:11.359
I, too, am sick of war, Reverend.

38:11.711 --> 38:20.175
But we must consistently ask
ourselves what is worth fighting for?

38:20.477 --> 38:25.575
What is worth laying our
lives on the line for?

38:29.089 --> 38:32.248
Robert Bell gave his life
for this undertaking.

38:32.414 --> 38:37.406
For this grand idea,
and I assure you,

38:37.531 --> 38:40.044
he did not give his life in vain,

38:40.169 --> 38:43.017
for he knew what this railroad

38:43.142 --> 38:45.888
would mean to us as a nation.

38:46.013 --> 38:50.564
He knew this railroad is
a new birth of freedom.

38:50.906 --> 38:54.537
Not just the freedom
of long distance travel,

38:54.662 --> 38:57.776
but the freedom to choose your fate,

38:58.126 --> 39:01.249
the freedom to make
your fortunes in this untamed land.

39:01.374 --> 39:05.423
And we cannot let
that freedom be threatened

39:05.548 --> 39:11.432
by rag-tag bands of marauding
stone age primitives.

39:12.595 --> 39:19.999
But that is not to say
that there is not a peaceful solution.

39:20.165 --> 39:23.823
If they will put down their sticks

39:23.948 --> 39:27.563
and stones and come into the fold,

39:27.688 --> 39:31.461
like this young man here...

39:32.698 --> 39:35.411
Then we will talk peace.

39:35.536 --> 39:40.988
Now, look at him...
Wearing our clothes,

39:41.114 --> 39:44.026
speaking our language,

39:44.375 --> 39:49.726
washed in the blood of our savior.

39:51.330 --> 39:58.050
If these violent nomads
roaming the plains

39:58.175 --> 40:00.019
are willing to do as he has done,

40:00.807 --> 40:02.857
then there is very real hope

40:03.159 --> 40:07.832
that our mission might be
accomplished peacefully.

40:08.167 --> 40:11.839
If not...

40:11.964 --> 40:18.019
Then they are the authors
of their own destruction.

40:57.877 --> 41:02.389
It's been months since
I've seen such a...

41:03.055 --> 41:05.298
S hole?

41:05.423 --> 41:07.600
Whoa.

41:07.726 --> 41:10.072
Will you be all right from here?

41:10.197 --> 41:13.701
You're not taking me in?

41:13.867 --> 41:17.776
The church and the Doctor
straight on up ahead.

41:18.879 --> 41:20.156
Wait.

41:20.281 --> 41:21.548
What about the bounty?

41:21.714 --> 41:23.762
I told ya,

41:23.887 --> 41:28.671
I got business to attend
to in Cheyenne territory.

41:28.796 --> 41:30.607
I got about 4 hours of daylight left.

41:30.732 --> 41:33.737
I gotta move.

41:35.508 --> 41:38.078
Mr. Bohannon?
