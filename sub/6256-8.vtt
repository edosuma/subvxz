00:01.823 --> 00:03.093
<i>The coroner said the remains</i>

00:03.094 --> 00:04.894
- should be here any minute.
- Daisy!

00:04.930 --> 00:08.031
Welcome back.

00:08.066 --> 00:10.934
Wow. You are so much bigger
than I expected.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.703
It looks like he might come out
dressed and ready for school.

00:13.738 --> 00:15.705
My doula assured me
that my meditation

00:15.740 --> 00:18.741
and my breathing exercises will
give me at least two more weeks.

00:18.777 --> 00:21.945
Well, you've been
through so much, losing Sweets.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.446
If you need to...
Thanks.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.281
I took the time I needed.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.550
Lance would want me
to rejoin the world.

00:27.585 --> 00:30.353
And the baby
and I have never felt better.

00:30.388 --> 00:32.021
You do seem very... Zen.

00:32.057 --> 00:34.524
I remember, at this point
I was driving Hodgins nuts,

00:34.559 --> 00:36.125
trying to get him

00:36.161 --> 00:37.593
to set up
Michael Vincent's room.

00:37.629 --> 00:39.529
Well, there's no rush.

00:39.564 --> 00:41.764
When he's ready, he'll tell me
how he wants his room set up.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.101
So, you're waiting until he can
talk before he has a room?

00:45.136 --> 00:47.770
Oh, my doula says
that a mother doesn't need words

00:47.806 --> 00:49.439
to communicate with her baby.

00:49.474 --> 00:52.208
Ah. This doula sounds

00:52.243 --> 00:55.545
like a... fascinating woman.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.180
Oh, she is.
She is.

00:57.215 --> 00:58.948
Ms. Wick?
Oh, over here.

00:58.984 --> 01:02.085
I'll get the remains
set up on the platform.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.453
This way.

01:03.488 --> 01:04.953
Okay.

01:04.989 --> 01:08.024
Who is that woman, and what
has she done with Daisy?

01:08.059 --> 01:10.326
Yeah.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.600
Apparently, the protesters
were at the fracking site,

01:17.635 --> 01:19.435
and they saw the remains
in the pit.

01:19.471 --> 01:22.372
Any idea how he or she ended up
in the fracking pit?

01:22.407 --> 01:25.375
No, but the protesters are
accusing the fracking company,

01:25.410 --> 01:27.677
which is mere supposition.
Well,

01:27.712 --> 01:29.812
the fracking people
are freaking, right?

01:29.848 --> 01:32.288
They have enough bad publicity
without dead bodies turning up.

01:32.317 --> 01:33.816
True.

01:33.852 --> 01:36.486
I recently read that in
Colorado, they have found a link

01:36.521 --> 01:38.121
between fracking
and increased seismic activity.

01:38.156 --> 01:39.722
All right, look.

01:39.758 --> 01:41.324
They're putting a lot
of pressure on the Bureau

01:41.359 --> 01:42.925
to get this solved quickly.

01:42.961 --> 01:44.961
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna be as careless

01:44.996 --> 01:47.363
with my science
as they are about theirs.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.532
I believe that's everything.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.868
Yeah, everything that's ever
been made for a baby.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.270
Perhaps I've gone
a bit overboard,

01:54.305 --> 01:56.939
but this is...
Sweets' and Daisy's baby.

01:56.975 --> 01:59.275
I am totally with you
on this. You know what?

01:59.310 --> 02:01.044
We will be there for
every school play,

02:01.079 --> 02:03.146
graduation and hockey game.

02:03.181 --> 02:06.115
You're going
to be a good uncle, Booth.

02:06.151 --> 02:07.316
Thanks...

02:07.352 --> 02:08.818
Oh.

02:08.853 --> 02:10.119
Brennan. Yes?
Booth. Yeah.

02:10.155 --> 02:11.721
Okay.
On my way.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.523
Uh, 20 minutes.
Okay, I'll be... Great.

02:13.558 --> 02:16.259
All right, thanks. Bye.
All right, Stark. See you soon.

02:16.294 --> 02:18.661
Stark wants me in the office.
Cam needs me, too.

02:18.696 --> 02:20.096
Can you help me
get this to the car?

02:20.131 --> 02:21.564
Oh, whoa, not this!

02:21.599 --> 02:23.299
A classic. We got
to keep this!

02:23.334 --> 02:25.301
Oh, no.
Booth, are you serious?

02:25.336 --> 02:26.836
Come on, right?
Let's see if it works.

02:26.871 --> 02:28.538
What are we gonna
use it for?

02:28.573 --> 02:31.040
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

02:31.076 --> 02:33.643
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup. Got to keep this.

02:35.847 --> 02:38.381
Given the narrow
subpubic concavity

02:38.416 --> 02:41.350
and the irregularly-lipped
ventral margin

02:41.386 --> 02:44.187
at the pubic symphysis, the
victim was male in his 40s.

02:44.222 --> 02:45.688
The left ulna was

02:45.723 --> 02:47.790
definitely fractured,
which explains the cast.

02:47.826 --> 02:49.358
But there's no
other damage evident

02:49.394 --> 02:51.494
that would give us
cause of death.

02:51.529 --> 02:54.263
I have a few little things for
the baby. I'll show you later.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.699
That's so nice. Thank you.

02:56.734 --> 03:00.103
I'm sure the baby can feel
your generosity.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.005
I doubt that very much.

03:03.041 --> 03:06.109
These bones are quite porous.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.743
I've uploaded the photos
of the remains

03:07.779 --> 03:09.145
from the coroner's report.

03:09.180 --> 03:10.613
These were taken

03:10.648 --> 03:13.716
on-site an hour ago.
- No.

03:13.751 --> 03:16.152
No, there must be some mistake.
These aren't the same remains.

03:16.187 --> 03:18.698
There's at least 20% more tissue
on the remains in the photos.

03:18.722 --> 03:19.523
No. These are

03:19.524 --> 03:21.891
definitely the photos from the
report, but I have never seen

03:21.926 --> 03:23.626
tissue loss
like this before.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.528
Hey. So, I just
performed a litmus test

03:25.563 --> 03:28.397
on the water that they brought
in from the fracking pit.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.366
The water in that pit
isn't just water.

03:30.401 --> 03:32.135
It's been spiked with
hydrochloric acid.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.737
Don't those sites use acid
as part of the process?

03:34.772 --> 03:36.172
But it's used in a much milder
concentration

03:36.207 --> 03:37.473
than what I just found.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.509
There must still be acid
on the remains.

03:39.544 --> 03:40.877
That's what's causing
the rapid tissue loss.

03:40.912 --> 03:42.512
No, no, no, don't...

03:42.547 --> 03:44.080
No one touch it until we know
what we're dealing with.

03:44.115 --> 03:46.949
But the acid is still consuming
the bones.

03:46.985 --> 03:48.618
You know, I'm on it.

03:48.653 --> 03:50.586
Maybe this is why the fracking
company was trying

03:50.622 --> 03:52.421
to get in the middle
of the investigation.

03:52.457 --> 03:54.417
Are you saying someone
from the company killed one

03:54.425 --> 03:56.585
of the protesters and is trying
to destroy the remains?

03:56.594 --> 03:57.994
There's no evidence of that.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.262
Soon we'll have no evidence
of anything.

03:59.297 --> 04:00.763
Okay.

04:00.798 --> 04:02.632
Stand back!
I got it. I got it. I got it.

04:05.303 --> 04:06.802
Wha...?

04:14.145 --> 04:15.711
Yeah.

04:17.015 --> 04:18.079
What have you done?!

04:18.116 --> 04:19.615
It's baking soda.

04:19.651 --> 04:22.218
It's not just
for cooking anymore.

04:22.253 --> 04:26.122
It should stop the acid from
eating the remains. I hope.

The baking soda made the
remains smell nice and fresh.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.801
Hmm, all this tissue seems
to be compromised.

05:05.837 --> 05:09.038
I don't know what I'm gonna get
from a tox screen.

05:09.073 --> 05:11.207
Well, you're definitely gonna
get hydrochloric acid,

05:11.242 --> 05:13.175
ethylene glycol,
biocides, diesel fuel.

05:13.211 --> 05:15.011
I mean, it was all
in the pit.

05:15.046 --> 05:16.946
Well, the porous
nature of the bones

05:16.981 --> 05:19.715
and the irregular pitting
on the surface indicates

05:19.751 --> 05:22.151
that the remains weren't
in the pit for very long.

05:22.186 --> 05:24.587
Well, the speed at which
they're being degraded--

05:24.622 --> 05:27.089
I'm surprised we don't
just have a gelatinous goo.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.058
Well, I should be able to
recreate the exact conditions

05:29.093 --> 05:30.893
to tell us how long
he was in the pit.

05:30.928 --> 05:33.062
Hey, Cam,
check this thing out.

05:33.097 --> 05:35.131
The fabric that got caught here

05:35.166 --> 05:37.700
on the cast-- it looks like
it's got some blood on it.

05:37.735 --> 05:41.704
Well, I'll try to get DNA off
it so that I can ID the victim.

05:41.739 --> 05:43.072
Thanks again, Dr. B.,

05:43.107 --> 05:45.274
for sharing Christine's stuff
with us.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.243
I know there's a lot there.

05:47.278 --> 05:49.278
Don't feel like
you have to use it all.

05:49.314 --> 05:51.347
I won't. The baby will
let me know

05:51.382 --> 05:53.649
what he's drawn to
and what disturbs him.

05:53.685 --> 05:58.688
I don't think you understand
infants, Ms. Wick.

05:58.723 --> 06:01.290
My doula says the baby and I
will be able to communicate

06:01.326 --> 06:03.259
as long as we both keep
our spirits open.

06:03.294 --> 06:05.461
Your baby
will communicate when

06:05.496 --> 06:07.229
he defecates or is hungry.

06:07.265 --> 06:10.333
And he will do so by crying,
not picking out clothing.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.468
Are you feeling
okay there, Daisy?

06:12.503 --> 06:13.969
I've never felt better.

06:14.005 --> 06:15.604
The majority of the victim's

06:15.640 --> 06:18.407
skull exhibits
the same pitting evident

06:18.443 --> 06:20.109
on the rest of the remains,

06:20.144 --> 06:22.645
except for this large section
of the occipital.

06:28.586 --> 06:30.453
Because this section isn't bone.

06:30.488 --> 06:32.922
It's a plastic polymer.

06:32.957 --> 06:36.992
So, he must have suffered some
sort of head trauma in the past.

06:37.028 --> 06:40.129
And the polymer piece was used
to repair the skull.

06:40.164 --> 06:42.998
Well, it's most likely
polyetherketoneketone.

06:43.034 --> 06:46.802
It's the most biocompatible
and osteoconductive substance.

06:46.838 --> 06:48.637
It's a very rare procedure.

06:48.673 --> 06:51.273
There have only been two
documented cases in the U.S.

06:51.309 --> 06:54.343
Yay. Rare is good.
It'll help us ID the victim.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.350
Okay, so
the site manager admitted

07:01.386 --> 07:04.820
that only three of
the security cameras were real,

07:04.856 --> 07:06.956
and they were all covering
the front entrance.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.424
Well, that's why
there's no footage

07:08.459 --> 07:09.692
of the pit the guy died in.

07:09.727 --> 07:10.757
I mean, you'd think

07:10.758 --> 07:12.024
they'd want working
security cameras

07:12.059 --> 07:13.525
with all the
protesters they get.

07:13.561 --> 07:15.327
Well, you would think,
but, uh, you know,

07:15.362 --> 07:17.563
he was accused
of beating up protesters before.

07:17.598 --> 07:20.265
So he was protecting himself.
No, not him.

07:20.301 --> 07:21.834
He's got an alibi.

07:21.869 --> 07:23.235
He's got a sick brother
that he's been visiting

07:23.270 --> 07:24.830
in the hospital
for that past two weeks.

07:24.839 --> 07:26.949
There's, like, what,
a million witnesses.

07:26.950 --> 07:29.274
Yeah.
That's a lot of witnesses.

07:29.310 --> 07:31.478
So, maybe he was using other
employees to do his dirty work.

07:31.479 --> 07:33.979
Exactly what I was thinking, which is why
I want you to check 'em out.

07:34.014 --> 07:36.982
Oh, okay. There's got to be,
like, 50 people here.

07:37.017 --> 07:39.351
There's only 46.
You get off easy.

07:39.386 --> 07:40.786
Right?
Thank you.

07:40.821 --> 07:42.254
Yeah.

07:42.289 --> 07:44.857
I was able
to ID the victim.

07:44.892 --> 07:47.960
Turns out, he was in a boating
accident three years ago,

07:47.995 --> 07:50.863
and his surgery
made national news.

07:50.898 --> 07:53.632
Here he is.
Lawrence Brooks.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.268
Oh, my God. Are you sure?
You know him?

07:56.303 --> 07:58.337
He's <i> the</i> puzzle master.

07:58.372 --> 08:00.105
His crossword puzzles
are syndicated

08:00.141 --> 08:02.174
in hundreds of papers.

08:02.209 --> 08:04.510
He's got a book deal.
There's no one better.

08:04.545 --> 08:06.745
Oh, so he wasn't a protester?

08:06.780 --> 08:09.081
Well, no. He was
something of a recluse.

08:09.116 --> 08:12.351
God, I love his puzzles.
I mean, they were impossible.

08:12.386 --> 08:14.620
Maybe that's why he was killed.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.589
He lived less than a mile
from the fracking site.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.725
The article mentions
his wife, Emilia,

08:19.760 --> 08:23.328
but she never reported him
missing, and she still hasn't.

08:23.364 --> 08:27.332
<i>I just assumed he was off</i>
<i>somewhere, creating a puzzle.</i>

08:27.368 --> 08:29.001
They were like his children.

08:29.036 --> 08:31.136
I guess that's why
he never wanted to have kids.

08:31.172 --> 08:33.804
Oh, you sound a little
bitter about that.

08:33.841 --> 08:37.609
I loved Lawrence, but
no marriage is perfect, is it?

08:37.645 --> 08:39.745
Which is why I'm still single.

08:40.948 --> 08:43.148
So when was the last time
you saw him?

08:43.183 --> 08:44.449
Right before I went

08:44.485 --> 08:46.752
to the grocery store
yesterday morning.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.754
Okay. And can you think
of any reason

08:48.789 --> 08:51.023
that someone might have wanted
to harm your husband?

08:51.058 --> 08:55.260
Not harm, I'm sure,
but Alexis Sherman,

08:55.296 --> 08:57.863
Lawrence's assistant,
is very ambitious,

08:57.898 --> 08:59.565
and she resented the fact

08:59.600 --> 09:01.934
that he never let her write
any puzzles on her own.

09:01.969 --> 09:04.369
Oh, unfortunately, people
have been killed for less.

09:04.405 --> 09:06.205
But he promised
to make her co-editor,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.974
so she knew that was coming
eventually.

09:09.009 --> 09:11.710
Yeah, but some people
can get very impatient.

09:15.082 --> 09:18.483
The impressions from the pen
were still on the cast.

09:18.519 --> 09:21.220
That's how I was able to
recreate what was written on it.

09:22.923 --> 09:25.524
The blood on the fabric

09:25.559 --> 09:27.559
was degraded by the acid,

09:27.595 --> 09:29.528
so I could only get
a weak STR profile,

09:29.563 --> 09:31.830
but it appears to be
a match for the victim.

09:31.865 --> 09:34.366
What's all this on the cast?

09:34.401 --> 09:37.236
They appear to be
crossword puzzle clues.

09:37.271 --> 09:39.004
Well, it makes sense.
He was the puzzle master.

09:39.039 --> 09:42.040
Yeah, except this is not all
of his handwriting.

09:45.079 --> 09:49.982
The handwriting on these clues
is different than these.

09:50.017 --> 09:52.184
Well, and this is
definitely his handwriting.

09:52.219 --> 09:53.986
How do you know that?

09:54.021 --> 09:58.690
I may or may not have
a... an autographed copy

09:58.726 --> 10:01.026
of one of his completed puzzles.

10:01.061 --> 10:02.527
You really are a fan.

10:02.563 --> 10:05.797
This is not his handwriting.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.833
"Despise ." Hate.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.501
"Blood feud."

10:09.536 --> 10:13.038
Vendetta.
This is a very simple puzzle.

10:13.073 --> 10:15.674
"Avenge ." Punish.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.376
This one's "attack,"
this one's "payback,"

10:17.411 --> 10:18.710
that one's "justice."

10:18.746 --> 10:20.612
This looks like some kind of

10:20.648 --> 10:22.614
a message from his killer.

10:27.321 --> 10:29.755
Ooh, Booth said

10:29.790 --> 10:32.357
the wife told them
about Brooks' assistant.

10:32.393 --> 10:36.128
If she killed him, the clues
on his cast make sense.

10:36.163 --> 10:38.630
Yeah, great.
I want to talk about Daisy.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.566
I think that she might be
having a nervous breakdown.

10:41.602 --> 10:43.835
Her work
on the case is exemplary.

10:43.871 --> 10:45.237
Honey,

10:45.272 --> 10:47.105
she's shopping for crystals.

10:47.141 --> 10:49.074
She told me
that her doula told her

10:49.109 --> 10:51.476
that if she found the right one,
that it would

10:51.512 --> 10:54.212
channel positive energy
into her womb

10:54.248 --> 10:56.381
and make the birth painless.

10:56.417 --> 10:58.817
Well, that's foolish
and ignorant,

10:58.852 --> 11:01.286
but it's not
a nervous breakdown.

11:01.322 --> 11:02.587
I told her
it was like...

11:02.623 --> 11:04.623
having a minivan
drive out of you,

11:04.658 --> 11:05.857
no matter how many crystals

11:05.893 --> 11:07.259
you buy.
Wait.

11:07.294 --> 11:09.594
Didn't Daisy ask
for general anesthesia

11:09.630 --> 11:11.563
when she had her tooth filled?
My point

11:11.598 --> 11:15.100
exactly. This doula does not
know who she's dealing with.

11:15.135 --> 11:16.802
Is there anything I can do?

11:16.837 --> 11:19.071
Uh, maybe just keep telling her
she's ignorant.

11:19.106 --> 11:20.272
Stuff like that.

11:20.307 --> 11:22.140
Of course.
She has a doctor's

11:22.176 --> 11:24.943
appointment this afternoon,
so I'm gonna drive her.

11:24.978 --> 11:27.212
Maybe if I meet this doula,

11:27.247 --> 11:30.115
I'll be able to understand
why Daisy likes her so much.

11:30.150 --> 11:33.418
Should I go now and tell her
that she's ignorant?

11:33.454 --> 11:37.889
Maybe... let that come
a little more naturally.

11:37.925 --> 11:39.858
Right.

11:39.893 --> 11:41.593
Okay.

11:41.628 --> 11:43.128
<i>Wow.</i>

11:43.163 --> 11:45.130
I didn't realize
Emilia hated me that much.

11:45.165 --> 11:47.265
So you weren't mad that Brooks
promised you all this

11:47.301 --> 11:48.633
and never delivered?
Of course I was.

11:48.669 --> 11:52.204
I may have even screamed
and yelled about it,

11:52.239 --> 11:53.972
but at the end of the day,
I still had the best job

11:54.007 --> 11:55.707
in the world working for him.

11:55.743 --> 11:57.976
I can't believe he's gone.

11:58.011 --> 12:00.112
Yeah. And now you get to...

12:00.147 --> 12:02.848
edit the puzzles.
And you get Lawrence's salary.

12:02.883 --> 12:05.484
I resent what you're saying.
Look, we're just stating facts.

12:05.519 --> 12:08.587
The killer left a lot of
hostile clues on Brooks' cast.

12:08.622 --> 12:10.122
Clever ones.

12:10.157 --> 12:11.623
Do you want my help
finding Lawrence's killer

12:11.658 --> 12:13.291
or did you just come here
to insult me?

12:13.327 --> 12:14.559
Look, anything
that you can...

12:14.595 --> 12:16.395
help us with,
that would be great.

12:16.430 --> 12:19.030
Thank you.

12:23.036 --> 12:25.537
You're a thief, Brooks!
And a hack!

12:25.572 --> 12:26.905
No one does that to me.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.874
Not even you. You're done!

12:28.909 --> 12:30.842
What did Brooks do?
I have no idea.

12:30.878 --> 12:33.512
Message was left a couple days
ago, right around the same time

12:33.547 --> 12:35.480
some weird guy showed up
looking for Lawrence.

12:35.516 --> 12:37.744
Said he had an appointment, but
there was nothing on the books.

12:37.818 --> 12:39.590
And you think that's the same guy
that left the message?

12:39.591 --> 12:42.120
All I know is the message and the guy
showed up around the same time.

12:42.156 --> 12:45.257
I saw the same guy again
yesterday in the parking lot,

12:45.292 --> 12:46.925
like some kind
of stalker.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.527
Yesterday.

12:48.562 --> 12:49.694
So you wouldn't mind
talking to a forensic artist

12:49.730 --> 12:51.596
and giving a description?
Sure.

12:51.632 --> 12:53.272
I'll do anything
to help you guys find out

12:53.300 --> 12:54.833
who did this to Lawrence.

12:57.547 --> 13:01.596
So, Terry telling me the number
that was used, to, uh, threaten Brooks.

13:01.597 --> 13:04.198
It came from the lobby
of the Granville Hotel.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.730
So you have no way of
knowing who made the call.

13:06.754 --> 13:07.535
It could have been anyone.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.703
A concierge. You know,
a guest at the hotel.

13:09.739 --> 13:11.905
A schmo off the street.
So we could

13:11.941 --> 13:13.841
be looking for someone
who speaks Yiddish.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.877
What? What are you talking...
What made you make that turn?

13:16.912 --> 13:18.512
"Schmo." It's Yiddish
for "idiot."

13:18.547 --> 13:20.080
So I assumed you were saying
we're looking

13:20.116 --> 13:21.648
for a mentally challenged,
Yiddish-speaking...

13:21.684 --> 13:23.450
Stop, okay, Bones?

13:23.486 --> 13:25.652
The killer
doesn't speak Yiddish.

13:25.688 --> 13:26.920
How do you know?

13:26.956 --> 13:28.276
I don't,
but that's not the point.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.556
Then why did you bring it up?

13:29.592 --> 13:31.358
I didn't bring it up.
You said "schmo."

13:31.393 --> 13:32.659
Okay, fine. You know what,
I'll never bring it up again.

13:32.695 --> 13:34.194
I promise.
Promise.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.330
I think I might have found
our guy.

13:36.365 --> 13:37.464
Does he speak Yiddish?

13:37.500 --> 13:38.532
What?

13:38.567 --> 13:39.600
Never mind. What is it?

13:39.635 --> 13:40.734
Was Angela able

13:40.770 --> 13:42.536
to create a sketch
of the stalker?

13:42.571 --> 13:45.539
Yeah. And it gave us a
guy who's in the system.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.207
Emory Stewart.
Up until two years ago,

13:47.243 --> 13:49.643
Stewart was a model citizen.
Smart, too.

13:49.678 --> 13:52.546
Dual degrees in computer science
and cryptography.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.648
Clearly he's intelligent,
so he's not a schmo.

13:54.683 --> 13:56.083
He's a <i> chachem.</i>

13:57.353 --> 13:59.286
Right. Looks like his problem
started

13:59.321 --> 14:01.263
two years ago when his parents
died in a car accident.

14:01.287 --> 14:02.357
Exactly.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.624
Since then, he's had two DUIs,

14:03.659 --> 14:05.225
a few disturbing the peace
violations,

14:05.261 --> 14:06.660
a couple of assault charges...

14:06.695 --> 14:08.796
So a <i> farshtunken chachem.</i>

14:08.831 --> 14:11.031
I got nothing.
Never mind.

14:11.066 --> 14:12.699
Just bring him in, okay?

14:17.339 --> 14:19.506
<i>Our real challenge here</i>
<i>is getting</i>

14:19.542 --> 14:21.108
the acid concentration
just right

14:21.143 --> 14:23.177
by getting the right piece
of pork to mirror

14:23.212 --> 14:26.246
the relative mass
of the actual victim.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.608
And the solution replicates
the conditions in the pit?

14:28.632 --> 14:29.350
Yeah.

14:29.351 --> 14:31.485
We've got the mud and
hydrochloric acid, as well

14:31.520 --> 14:33.687
as the other caustic chemicals
that we found at the site.

14:33.722 --> 14:36.223
Wow. Okay. Well, that batch
is a little undercooked.

14:36.258 --> 14:39.293
On to the next.
Daisy,

14:39.328 --> 14:42.262
do you really believe
in all that new age stuff?

14:42.298 --> 14:46.500
Science can only go so far,
Dr. Hodgins.

14:46.535 --> 14:49.837
You think I've changed
since Lance died, don't you?

14:49.872 --> 14:51.839
We all change. All the time.

14:51.874 --> 14:53.774
You know, that is science.

14:53.809 --> 14:57.044
It's just... I don't want you
to push us all away

14:57.079 --> 14:59.613
because you're afraid
of losing someone else.

14:59.648 --> 15:03.717
Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar, Dr. Hodgins.

15:03.752 --> 15:06.253
Yeah.

15:08.290 --> 15:09.957
Oh, perfect.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.426
The degree of pitting
matches the victim's bones.

15:12.461 --> 15:15.195
Okay.
So that would mean...

15:15.231 --> 15:17.197
the victim was put
into the pit

15:17.233 --> 15:20.901
between... 9:30 and 10:00
last night.

15:20.936 --> 15:22.603
Okay then. Back to work.

15:26.609 --> 15:28.842
So, Emory, I have
an eyewitness saying

15:28.878 --> 15:30.978
that you were stalking
Lawrence Brooks.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.746
What's this about?
Did Lawrence put out

15:32.781 --> 15:34.248
a restraining order
or something?

15:34.283 --> 15:36.750
If he wants me to stay away,
he just has to say so.

15:36.785 --> 15:39.052
Brooks is dead. He was murdered.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.888
I-I just...

15:40.923 --> 15:42.656
I c... I can't believe this.
How did it happen?

15:42.691 --> 15:45.692
Where were you last night
around 10:00?

15:45.728 --> 15:46.960
Whoa. You think that I...

15:46.996 --> 15:48.462
No. L-Lawrence
was...

15:48.497 --> 15:50.063
was like a g... a god to me.
A god to you.

15:50.099 --> 15:52.532
Exactly. That's how stalkers
feel about their prey.

15:52.568 --> 15:54.401
Stalker? I'm not a stalker.

15:54.436 --> 15:55.769
Look in my bag.

15:55.804 --> 15:57.804
Sure, look in your bag.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.073
What do we have here?

16:00.109 --> 16:02.509
What's that?
I'm writing a book

16:02.544 --> 16:04.278
on Brooks. I'm not some nut job.

16:04.313 --> 16:06.313
I've been researching him
for two years.

16:06.348 --> 16:09.917
Right. While you're not, uh,
assaulting people.

16:09.952 --> 16:11.685
Man, you've done your homework.
Sort of my job.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.053
When my parents died,

16:13.088 --> 16:16.456
I had some anger issues.
I got counseling.

16:16.492 --> 16:18.550
But it has absolutely nothing
to do with Lawrence Brooks.

16:18.574 --> 16:19.694
Right, well,

16:19.695 --> 16:21.261
I'm gonna need to take
a recording of your voice

16:21.297 --> 16:23.997
and, uh, compare it to the
threat that Brooks received.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.799
Someone threatened him?

16:25.834 --> 16:27.467
Is that a yes or a no?
Yes.

16:27.503 --> 16:29.603
Sure. Anything you want.
Great.

16:29.638 --> 16:31.538
Anything. Okay.
Since you're such a know-it-all

16:31.573 --> 16:34.808
about Brooks,
who are his enemies?

16:34.843 --> 16:37.444
McKeon. I'm sure you've talked
to him already.

16:37.479 --> 16:38.845
Who's McKeon?

16:38.881 --> 16:40.681
Donald McKeon
was Lawrence's old roommate

16:40.716 --> 16:43.183
in college
before Lawrence dropped out.

16:43.218 --> 16:44.484
Donald is also a puzzler.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.087
So they were competitors?
Unequal

16:47.122 --> 16:49.156
but I guess you could say that.
Donald writes

16:49.191 --> 16:51.124
those cheesy puzzles
you find at the car wash.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.161
You know, with clues like
"a three-letter word for a grown kitten."

16:54.196 --> 16:56.697
So he was jealous of his career.
Very.

16:56.732 --> 16:58.298
Lawrence's success
drove Donald crazy.

16:58.334 --> 16:59.866
It's all in my book.

16:59.902 --> 17:03.804
You can take the manuscript
if you think it'll help.

17:09.678 --> 17:12.279
You found something, Ms. Wick?
Or do you merely want to discuss

17:12.314 --> 17:15.482
additional foolish notions
of early childhood development?

17:15.517 --> 17:16.883
That was harsh.

17:16.919 --> 17:19.353
Yes, it was.

17:19.387 --> 17:22.021
I'm trying to help you, but...

17:22.057 --> 17:25.826
I'm told my people skills
are not well developed.

17:25.861 --> 17:28.395
Perhaps we can just stick
to the case.

17:28.430 --> 17:31.431
I would like that very much.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.301
The victim has an extensive
amount of remodeled fractures

17:34.336 --> 17:37.504
localized around the pelvis,
ribs, ankles, and arms.

17:37.539 --> 17:40.474
All of it occurring
within the last 18 months.

17:40.509 --> 17:43.844
What do you suppose caused
these antemortem injuries?

17:43.879 --> 17:47.547
Look at the X ray of
his femoral shafts.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.916
Thinning

17:49.952 --> 17:52.052
of the cortical bones
of both femurs.

17:52.087 --> 17:53.620
Meaning that
the victim's

17:53.655 --> 17:55.989
bone density was compromised
even before the acid.

17:56.025 --> 17:59.326
That's why our 48-year-old victim
has the bones of an octogenarian.

17:59.361 --> 18:02.095
You should perform
a trephine bone marrow biopsy on

18:02.131 --> 18:04.097
the posterior iliac crest,
then screen

18:04.133 --> 18:06.066
for poison and other toxins.

18:06.101 --> 18:09.069
I have an ob-gyn appointment.

18:09.104 --> 18:10.604
I told you about it.

18:10.639 --> 18:13.040
Yes. Um, of course.

18:13.075 --> 18:16.376
I-I can perform the biopsy.

18:16.412 --> 18:19.546
And this appointment, it's...

18:20.816 --> 18:24.251
...it's with a... real doctor?

18:24.286 --> 18:26.853
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.898
I'm alone now.

18:37.933 --> 18:41.468
It's just... me and the baby.

18:41.503 --> 18:44.938
I have to find a way
to make that work for me,

18:44.973 --> 18:47.707
to... connect to him

18:47.743 --> 18:50.644
without Lance here.

18:55.584 --> 18:58.718
I'm doing the best I can.

19:10.499 --> 19:12.732
Thanks so much for
coming with me.

19:12.768 --> 19:15.135
You can leave when the doula
gets here, if you want.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.604
What? No.
Why would I do that?

19:17.639 --> 19:19.439
Daisy, we all love you.

19:19.475 --> 19:22.576
And this is not an inconvenience
for me or for any of us.

19:22.611 --> 19:24.945
There's my
budding Daisy.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.280
Valentina, hi.

19:27.316 --> 19:30.183
This is Angela.
She and I work

19:30.219 --> 19:32.486
at the lab together.
Hi.

19:32.521 --> 19:35.455
One of the scientists who don't
believe what they can't see.

19:35.491 --> 19:38.024
Oh, no. It isn't like that.
Yeah, no.

19:38.060 --> 19:42.629
It's more like a friend who can
offer some help and support.

19:42.664 --> 19:44.197
Of course. And did you have

19:44.233 --> 19:45.832
a non-traumatic
birthing process, too?

19:45.868 --> 19:47.200
Oh, no. God,

19:47.236 --> 19:48.602
I had a... epidural

19:48.637 --> 19:50.170
and screaming
and the whole thing.

19:50.205 --> 19:52.038
Well,

19:52.074 --> 19:54.908
everyone has to make their own
choices is what I believe.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.643
But you seem like a nice person.

19:56.678 --> 19:59.012
I'm sure
your child will be fine.

19:59.047 --> 20:00.947
My child is fine.

20:00.983 --> 20:04.284
The birthing process
was beautiful, actually,

20:04.319 --> 20:05.685
screaming and all.

20:05.721 --> 20:07.587
Michael Vincent
is a perfect little boy,

20:07.623 --> 20:10.690
- and Angela is a great mom.
- Daisy?

20:10.726 --> 20:12.325
The doctor's ready for you.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.895
You can wait out here.

20:14.930 --> 20:15.729
Oh, but she came...

20:15.753 --> 20:17.761
Well, we talked
about mixing different energies.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.600
And you agreed.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.036
It's okay, Daisy.
I'll just wait here.

20:23.071 --> 20:26.473
Wouldn't want to mix up
our energies.

20:32.414 --> 20:34.481
Hey. The kid's voice
doesn't match the voice

20:34.516 --> 20:36.449
that was used to
threaten Brooks.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.233
So where are we going?

20:37.257 --> 20:39.053
We're gonna go pick
up Donald McKeon.

20:39.054 --> 20:40.619
The other puzzle guy. Wait,
doesn't he live in New York?

20:40.643 --> 20:41.822
Yeah.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.524
But he's been staying at
the Granville Hotel in DC

20:44.560 --> 20:46.927
for the past week.
Where the phone call came from.

20:46.962 --> 20:48.929
Exactly.
So Donald McKeon

20:48.964 --> 20:51.698
is a seven-letter word for a
person appearing to have engaged

20:51.733 --> 20:53.600
in activities that could have
resulted in the demise...

20:53.635 --> 20:55.635
All you have to do
is say "suspect," Aubrey.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.205
Spirit of the case.

21:01.701 --> 21:04.168
<i>So I left Brooks</i>
<i>an angry voice mail.</i>

21:04.204 --> 21:06.140
Last time I checked,
that wasn't a crime.

21:06.164 --> 21:07.806
Oh, it's not

21:07.807 --> 21:09.442
a crime, but killing him is.

21:09.443 --> 21:10.443
What?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.611
Lawrence is dead?
Yeah.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.246
And you hated him, didn't you?

21:14.281 --> 21:15.614
I d... I didn't kill him.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.282
We had our disagreements, but...

21:17.317 --> 21:18.617
He ignored you.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.154
Right? He thought
that you were a hack,

21:22.189 --> 21:23.622
that your puzzles were

21:23.657 --> 21:26.925
just crap.
Uh, we appealed to different markets.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.293
But you wanted his market.
Yeah.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.563
So, do you recognize
this handwriting here?

21:31.598 --> 21:35.700
No. But I recognize those clues.

21:35.736 --> 21:37.456
Well, you should,
because it's from the, uh,

21:37.471 --> 21:39.708
puzzle that you stole
from Brooks.

21:39.709 --> 21:40.808
What? No.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.894
Our agents found this
in your hotel room.

21:43.143 --> 21:44.676
You opened it!

21:44.711 --> 21:47.312
Why did you do that?
This was my proof.

21:47.347 --> 21:50.448
I wasn't stealing from Lawrence.
Lawrence was stealing from me.

21:50.484 --> 21:51.817
So...

21:51.852 --> 21:54.119
the nationally syndicated
puzzle master

21:54.154 --> 21:55.687
was stealing puzzles

21:55.722 --> 21:58.056
from you?
Okay, look,

21:58.091 --> 22:00.492
I know I seem like a hack.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.428
But I'm good, really good.

22:03.463 --> 22:06.731
Lawrence and I used to be
friends in college.

22:06.767 --> 22:09.267
I thought maybe he could
take a look at my puzzle--

22:09.303 --> 22:12.337
it's a good one-- and
consider it for publication.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.446
But he never even
acknowledged getting it.

22:14.470 --> 22:15.241
That must've

22:15.242 --> 22:16.975
really pissed you off.
No.

22:17.010 --> 22:19.010
What really
pissed me off was when

22:19.046 --> 22:21.116
he published the puzzle
under his own name.

22:21.116 --> 22:23.648
This guy's a hack. You know what,
you just keep digging yourself

22:23.684 --> 22:25.917
a bigger hole here, pal.
That call was never

22:25.953 --> 22:28.453
about killing him.
I was gonna take legal action.

22:28.488 --> 22:30.422
I mailed the
original puzzle

22:30.457 --> 22:32.357
to myself the same time
I sent it to him.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.326
It was proof
I'd been ripped off,

22:34.361 --> 22:36.862
until your agents
came along and tore it open.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.530
You wouldn't happen to have
another envelope

22:38.565 --> 22:40.832
containing a believable
alibi, would you?

22:40.868 --> 22:42.267
Yeah.

22:44.538 --> 22:47.138
Did Cam get the results back
she was running

22:47.174 --> 22:48.707
on the marrow biopsy?

22:48.742 --> 22:51.009
Not yet, but I did find
some subtle bone bruising

22:51.044 --> 22:54.880
around the metacarpophalangeal
joints on both his hands.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.581
Oh.

22:56.617 --> 22:59.284
So the victim
fought with his killer.

22:59.319 --> 23:00.952
He definitely
punched someone.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.021
Very good, Ms. Wick.

23:05.025 --> 23:06.625
Hold on.

23:09.463 --> 23:11.096
The protrusions
on the proximal phalanges

23:11.131 --> 23:13.999
at the
metacarpophalangeal joints

23:14.034 --> 23:16.001
on his right hand are
healed avulsion fractures

23:16.036 --> 23:17.636
due to hyperextension.

23:17.671 --> 23:20.605
His fingers were bent back
until they snapped.

23:20.641 --> 23:21.840
Remodeling suggests this

23:21.875 --> 23:23.808
happened two months ago.
So

23:23.844 --> 23:26.544
his murder wasn't
the first time he was assaulted.

23:26.580 --> 23:29.147
I have the results
of the tox screen of the marrow.

23:29.182 --> 23:30.916
The victim wasn't
poisoned, but he did

23:30.951 --> 23:33.451
show traces of donepezil
hydrochloride.

23:33.487 --> 23:35.587
That's used to treat
Alzheimer's.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.956
The head trauma that put him
in surgery three years ago

23:37.991 --> 23:39.624
could've triggered
an early onset.

23:39.660 --> 23:42.294
I-In rare cases, a side effect

23:42.329 --> 23:44.362
of donepezil hydrochloride

23:44.398 --> 23:46.464
is reduced bone density

23:46.500 --> 23:48.867
and increased bone fracturing.

23:48.902 --> 23:52.337
Which explains why the victim
had so many remodeled injuries.

23:52.372 --> 23:55.106
But Brooks' puzzles
could stump geniuses.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.609
How could someone with
Alzheimer's write them?

23:57.644 --> 23:59.644
<i>Right.</i>

23:59.680 --> 24:01.546
Okay. Thanks, Bones.

24:01.581 --> 24:04.082
So I've been looking at
Lawrence Brooks fan sites.

24:04.117 --> 24:06.184
There's a lot of chatter
about how his puzzles

24:06.219 --> 24:07.786
have been different lately.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.921
He might have been stealing
more than just Donald's.

24:09.957 --> 24:11.957
They were different
because he had Alzheimer's.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.992
Seriously?
Yeah. Somehow, the-the

24:14.027 --> 24:15.527
medication that he was
taking was, like,

24:15.562 --> 24:17.128
messing with his bones.
It's probably why he was

24:17.164 --> 24:19.097
turning into a recluse.
So it's

24:19.132 --> 24:21.733
likely he didn't even know he
was stealing Donald's puzzle.

24:21.768 --> 24:22.968
He could've thought it was his.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.436
Exactly.
It also explains

24:24.471 --> 24:27.105
the different styles of
handwriting on his cast.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.974
My grams had
dementia,

24:29.009 --> 24:31.943
and her handwriting would change
like she was a different person.

24:31.979 --> 24:33.979
Which she kind of was.
So if that's true,

24:34.014 --> 24:36.715
then the wife had to have known
that he had Alzheimer's.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.016
So why didn't she say anything?

24:38.051 --> 24:40.285
<i>Why didn't you tell us</i>

24:40.320 --> 24:42.954
your husband had Alzheimer's,
Mrs. Brooks?

24:42.990 --> 24:44.489
Because I promised
Lawrence

24:44.524 --> 24:46.391
I would never mention it.
It must be hard

24:46.426 --> 24:49.160
living your life that way.

24:52.899 --> 24:54.699
It was hard.

24:54.735 --> 24:57.602
Horrible, sometimes.

24:57.637 --> 24:59.537
Do you have any idea
what it's like

24:59.573 --> 25:01.806
when the person you've been
married to for 20 years

25:01.842 --> 25:04.442
looks at you as if
you're a stranger?

25:04.478 --> 25:06.711
But I loved him.
Even though he

25:06.747 --> 25:08.279
was disappearing,

25:08.315 --> 25:09.547
there was always
a little bit

25:09.583 --> 25:11.816
of the Lawrence
that I loved.

25:11.852 --> 25:13.818
And I would do anything
to preserve that.

25:13.854 --> 25:16.488
How was he able to keep
doing his puzzles?

25:16.523 --> 25:18.123
He wasn't.

25:18.158 --> 25:20.091
My husband's a
perfectionist and he

25:20.127 --> 25:22.327
must have had 100--
maybe more-- puzzles

25:22.362 --> 25:24.129
that he had created
and never published

25:24.164 --> 25:26.197
because he didn't think they
were good enough.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.565
And you were
publishing those for him?

25:27.601 --> 25:29.567
Yes.
And you published

25:29.603 --> 25:30.902
Donald McKeon's puzzle, too?
By accident.

25:30.937 --> 25:32.804
It was on
Lawrence's desk

25:32.839 --> 25:34.873
and I just assumed it was one of his.
Wouldn't it have been

25:34.908 --> 25:36.932
a lot easier for your husband
just to retire?

25:36.956 --> 25:38.411
Yes, but

25:38.412 --> 25:39.911
we needed the money.

25:39.946 --> 25:43.548
His treatment was expensive
and... we were broke.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.084
Lawrence Brooks was worth
well over a million dollars.

25:46.119 --> 25:48.386
We have his financials.
He was.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.555
But all that money is gone
and I have no idea where.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.557
When I asked him
about it,

25:52.592 --> 25:55.894
he couldn't remember
what he had done with it.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.662
Money like that doesn't
just disappear, you know?

25:57.697 --> 25:59.064
There's always a trail.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.032
Then please
find the trail.

26:01.068 --> 26:04.936
Then maybe you'll find
my husband's killer.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.820
<i>I've been going through Brooks'</i>

26:09.855 --> 26:13.690
bank statements. There were
e-payments made to LPAK, LLC

26:13.726 --> 26:15.692
that started
five months ago.

26:15.728 --> 26:18.162
Looks like the transfers
started off small and got

26:18.197 --> 26:19.710
bigger and bigger
as all the money dried up.

26:19.734 --> 26:20.565
Well,

26:20.566 --> 26:22.032
maybe someone knew
about his Alzheimer's

26:22.067 --> 26:23.834
and was using that
to steal his money.

26:23.869 --> 26:26.437
Well, it looks like it was
more simple than that.

26:26.472 --> 26:29.273
LPAK, LLC is
a front for an

26:29.308 --> 26:31.542
online gambling site.
Brooks

26:31.577 --> 26:33.677
gambled all his money away?
Oh, man, the guy

26:33.712 --> 26:36.013
probably didn't even know
how much money he was losing.

26:36.048 --> 26:38.682
It certainly explains
why his fingers got broken.

26:38.717 --> 26:40.717
It does? I-I thought
all these sites

26:40.753 --> 26:41.885
were out of the country.

26:41.921 --> 26:44.054
Well, most are,
but some are here.

26:44.089 --> 26:46.290
They're illegal,
but they're here.

26:46.325 --> 26:47.691
And after you sign up,

26:47.726 --> 26:49.626
if you want to stay
off the grid,

26:49.662 --> 26:51.428
you can meet
with the bookie in person.

26:51.452 --> 26:52.564
So maybe

26:52.565 --> 26:55.399
because of the Alzheimer's,
Brooks forgot to pay.

26:55.434 --> 26:58.535
This time the bookie did more
than just break his fingers.

27:02.374 --> 27:05.976
I was able to track down
the local bookie for the...

27:06.011 --> 27:07.878
The hell are you doing?

27:07.913 --> 27:09.646
What do you mean? I'm
checking out the, uh,

27:09.682 --> 27:11.114
gambling site that Brooks

27:11.150 --> 27:12.716
was using. This is amazing--
you can pretty much

27:12.751 --> 27:14.651
gamble on anything here.
I know. Someone

27:14.687 --> 27:17.287
placed a bet on the first
football player to tear his ACL

27:17.323 --> 27:19.223
next season. It's insane.
Unbelievable,

27:19.258 --> 27:22.226
right? Crazy. So are we active
members yet on the site?

27:22.261 --> 27:24.261
Uh, I am. Angela hacked
into a member's account

27:24.296 --> 27:25.762
and sent me an invitation,

27:25.798 --> 27:28.031
vouching for me.
You?

27:28.067 --> 27:31.034
Yeah. Me.
So... you can turn it off now.

27:31.070 --> 27:34.137
Sorry, y... you're-you're
getting a little bossy.

27:34.173 --> 27:36.573
Yeah, I know. It's, uh... Feels good.
I call the shots,

27:36.609 --> 27:39.510
all right? What we have to do is
we got to smoke out the bookie.

27:39.545 --> 27:41.945
All right? We got to place
a big bet and we got to lose.

27:41.981 --> 27:43.480
Well, that's what I'm trying
to tell you. I already

27:43.516 --> 27:45.115
placed the bet.
The next available

27:45.150 --> 27:48.218
bet was at the Wexford Track.
I put ten grand on a horse

27:48.254 --> 27:50.721
named Major Imperative.
I'm sorry-- what the hell

27:50.756 --> 27:52.389
do you think you're doing?
You don't need to

27:52.424 --> 27:54.091
look at it now.
I did my research.

27:54.126 --> 27:56.660
Major Imperative
is a sure-fire loss.

27:56.695 --> 27:58.395
I don't care if it's a sure-fire
loss, you understand me?

27:58.430 --> 27:59.863
I'm the lead, I authorize...
Whoa, whoa,

27:59.899 --> 28:01.532
all right?
Pipe down, okay?

28:01.567 --> 28:03.600
You're an addict,
Agent Booth,

28:03.636 --> 28:05.102
and I'm not gonna
let you jeopardize

28:05.137 --> 28:06.803
your gambling sobriety
on this case

28:06.839 --> 28:09.540
or any other case.

28:11.043 --> 28:12.242
You read my file.

28:12.278 --> 28:15.479
Yeah, 'cause I heard rumors.

28:15.514 --> 28:17.814
Sweets was pretty thorough
in his report, you know?

28:17.850 --> 28:19.650
You gambled
as a coping mechanism

28:19.685 --> 28:21.218
after your time
in the military.

28:21.253 --> 28:23.220
Look, you can take me
off the case if you want to,

28:23.255 --> 28:25.055
but a situation like this
comes up again,

28:25.090 --> 28:27.224
I will do the exact same thing.

28:32.498 --> 28:34.698
Major Imperative
better lose.

28:36.869 --> 28:38.969
What do I look like, a winner?

28:55.421 --> 28:56.887
You got an eye problem, pal?

28:56.922 --> 28:58.388
No.

28:58.424 --> 28:59.957
I'm 20/20.

28:59.992 --> 29:03.160
I'm also Agent James
Aubrey with the FBI.

29:03.195 --> 29:05.662
What, having a cup of coffee
is a crime now?

29:05.698 --> 29:07.631
No, but transferring
funds from a bank

29:07.666 --> 29:09.733
to an illegal online
gambling site is.

29:09.768 --> 29:13.170
In fact, that's a federal crime,
which is right up my alley.

29:13.205 --> 29:16.206
Congratulations,
I'm really happy for you.

29:16.241 --> 29:17.774
What's that got to do with me?

29:17.810 --> 29:20.210
Oh, you're really gonna
play stupid right now?

29:20.245 --> 29:21.812
Stupid?

29:21.847 --> 29:23.647
What's stupid?

29:23.682 --> 29:25.349
Well, stupid is
not realizing

29:25.384 --> 29:27.351
that I can arrest
you for murder.

29:27.386 --> 29:29.119
Murder?

29:29.154 --> 29:31.054
What the hell are you
talking about?

29:31.090 --> 29:33.156
Listen, pal, I don't know
who got killed,

29:33.192 --> 29:34.658
but I didn't murder nobody.

29:34.693 --> 29:36.660
Lawrence Brooks, all right?

29:36.695 --> 29:39.162
What? Next you're gonna
tell me you didn't

29:39.198 --> 29:41.598
break his fingers
a couple months back.

29:42.868 --> 29:46.069
Okay, the fingers, yeah.

29:46.105 --> 29:48.238
Look, I hated
to do it to the old guy,

29:48.273 --> 29:50.841
but, you know,
he was deep in the hole.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.643
What was I supposed to do?

29:52.678 --> 29:54.277
But I didn't kill him.

29:54.313 --> 29:56.546
Maybe you should talk to that
woman that he was bankrolling,

29:56.582 --> 29:59.062
because she started freaking out
as soon as the money dried up.

29:59.084 --> 30:00.584
Wait, wait, wait--

30:00.619 --> 30:02.619
what do you mean?
Brooks wasn't gambling?

30:02.655 --> 30:04.955
No, he was only the piggy bank.

30:04.990 --> 30:08.058
Look, the chick
that placed the bets--

30:08.093 --> 30:10.394
well, she lost big
a couple of months ago, right?

30:10.429 --> 30:13.664
So we decided to send her
a message through Brooks.

30:13.699 --> 30:16.099
We thought she'd care.

30:16.135 --> 30:17.968
We were wrong.

30:18.003 --> 30:19.636
So who was your client?

30:19.672 --> 30:22.806
The woman that worked for him.
His assistant.

30:22.841 --> 30:25.509
She's got a problem, now,
and I can tell you that.

30:28.981 --> 30:30.847
<i>Of course I had access</i>

30:30.883 --> 30:32.716
<i>to Lawrence's accounts</i>
<i>and credit cards.</i>

30:32.751 --> 30:34.963
I was his assistant. I did
his banking, paid his bills.

30:34.987 --> 30:35.887
So you

30:35.888 --> 30:37.888
took advantage of a man
who was losing his mind

30:37.923 --> 30:40.190
in order to feed
your gambling habit.

30:40.225 --> 30:41.078
Uh, no, no, I...

30:41.102 --> 30:43.463
Then you killed Brooks so it
wouldn't be traced back to you.

30:44.196 --> 30:46.263
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:46.298 --> 30:49.132
Fine.
Fine?

30:49.168 --> 30:50.801
Fine, I'll just go get
your bookie, Richie Williams.

30:50.836 --> 30:52.636
Maybe that'll help you remember
some of the details.

30:52.671 --> 30:55.439
Okay, stop, just wait, um...
Yes, yeah, I-I used

30:55.474 --> 30:59.276
Brooks' account to pay off some
debts, but-but that other stuff,

30:59.311 --> 31:02.312
the murder-- I swear I didn't
kill him. I could never.

31:02.347 --> 31:04.214
Sure you could.
When you're an addict,

31:04.249 --> 31:05.882
there's nothing you won't do.

31:05.918 --> 31:07.350
How did you
figure out

31:07.386 --> 31:08.685
that Brooks had Alzheimer's?

31:08.721 --> 31:10.854
Well, he started
getting confused

31:10.889 --> 31:13.623
over the littlest things,
and then... just like that,

31:13.659 --> 31:15.625
he would get agitated
and lash out. It happened

31:15.661 --> 31:18.061
often enough, it was easy
to put two and two together.

31:18.097 --> 31:19.465
Well, you're under arrest.

31:19.488 --> 31:21.098
Well... No, wait,
what are you talking about?

31:21.100 --> 31:22.384
I just told you--
I didn't kill him.

31:22.408 --> 31:23.568
I can't book you for Brooks'

31:23.569 --> 31:26.136
murder, but I definitely
can take you down for, uh,

31:26.171 --> 31:28.171
stealing his money. Let's go. Come on.
W... No, I was going to

31:28.207 --> 31:30.207
pay him back. I'm gonna
be making a lot of money

31:30.242 --> 31:32.209
because I have Brooks' old job now.
That's great.

31:32.244 --> 31:35.912
Maybe the paper'll let you
send puzzles from prison.

31:38.517 --> 31:41.818
Daisy, Dr. Brennan said you
were having contractions?

31:41.854 --> 31:44.888
Braxton Hicks.
They're nothing. Oh!

31:44.923 --> 31:46.289
Uh, ooh.

31:46.325 --> 31:49.226
Okay, they're something.

31:49.261 --> 31:50.861
But I still have two weeks.

31:50.896 --> 31:52.629
With all your talk about
listening to the baby,

31:52.664 --> 31:54.564
it seems like now
might be the time...

31:54.600 --> 31:57.067
I'm okay.
There appear to be

31:57.102 --> 31:58.502
bilateral neural arch fractures

31:58.537 --> 32:00.771
on the victim's
C5, 6 and 7. They were

32:00.806 --> 32:04.241
difficult to see
through the pitting.

32:04.276 --> 32:06.276
A broken neck--

32:06.311 --> 32:08.812
I believe you just
found cause of death.

32:08.847 --> 32:10.380
Hey,

32:10.415 --> 32:13.216
Booth just arrested
Lawrence's assistant.

32:13.252 --> 32:16.153
Even with, uh, the victim's
low bone density,

32:16.188 --> 32:18.555
I don't think she'd have
the strength to snap his neck.

32:18.590 --> 32:20.323
And there doesn't seem
to be evidence of a weapon

32:20.359 --> 32:23.560
that could... Oh! Aah!

32:23.595 --> 32:25.061
Oh, whoops.

32:25.097 --> 32:26.830
Oh, my God, Daisy,

32:26.865 --> 32:28.165
your water just broke.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.901
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up.
No,

32:30.936 --> 32:32.435
we're going to the hospital.
I should

32:32.471 --> 32:34.104
call Brennan.
Well, and I'll call your OB

32:34.139 --> 32:35.906
on the way there.
But we haven't figured out

32:35.941 --> 32:37.941
who killed the victim.
That doesn't matter now.

32:37.976 --> 32:40.844
Oh, okay. Well, somebody remind
the doctor that Valentina

32:40.879 --> 32:43.046
wants a darkened room
with bird sounds.

32:48.440 --> 32:51.541
I would recommend us
being alone now, Daisy.

32:51.576 --> 32:53.409
No external distractions.

32:53.444 --> 32:56.345
They're not distractions,
they're my friends.

32:56.380 --> 33:00.349
I'm sorry I left before
we discovered the killer.

33:00.384 --> 33:03.152
I was actually
thinking-- Oh...!

33:03.187 --> 33:04.687
It's okay, Daisy love,
just reminding you,

33:04.722 --> 33:08.324
your distress may cause
distress in the baby.

33:08.359 --> 33:10.559
A peaceful mother
makes a happy baby.

33:10.595 --> 33:12.061
Cut her some slack,
Valentina.

33:12.096 --> 33:15.698
A human being is trying
to escape from her vagina.

33:15.733 --> 33:17.800
Well, perhaps I can walk with
you and you can squeeze my hand.

33:17.835 --> 33:19.435
I did that when
I was in labor

33:19.470 --> 33:20.703
and I took great comfort

33:20.738 --> 33:22.838
knowing that Booth
was in pain, too.

33:22.874 --> 33:24.306
Yes, yes.

33:24.342 --> 33:26.876
Oh, Agent Booth
should be here, too.

33:26.911 --> 33:28.978
Daisy...
I want him here.

33:29.013 --> 33:30.145
He's the godfather.

33:30.181 --> 33:31.380
And I want to walk
with my friend.

33:31.415 --> 33:32.781
Oh...!

33:32.817 --> 33:35.784
Yelling will only make the baby
feel unwanted.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.620
Visualize a forest...

33:37.655 --> 33:39.121
Oh, for the love of God,
shut up.

33:39.156 --> 33:41.323
Oh...!

33:41.359 --> 33:42.591
Yeah, that's it, Daisy,
let it out.

33:42.627 --> 33:46.195
Oh...! Oh...!

33:46.230 --> 33:48.330
I really have to put my
foot down. This shrieking...

33:48.366 --> 33:50.699
Get out!
I can't listen to you anymore!

33:50.735 --> 33:53.702
Get your crystals
and get the hell out!

33:58.142 --> 33:59.875
Oh!

33:59.911 --> 34:01.377
Oh-oh...!

34:01.412 --> 34:03.078
Squeeze my hand--
Oh...!

34:03.114 --> 34:04.613
Very good.

34:04.649 --> 34:06.582
Daisy...
Go!

34:06.617 --> 34:07.783
And screw the tub!

34:07.818 --> 34:09.251
And screw the birds!

34:11.688 --> 34:14.389
I want shiny machines

34:14.425 --> 34:16.759
that beep, and I
want the lights on!

34:16.793 --> 34:18.260
And I want an epidural
and I want--

34:18.295 --> 34:19.795
Oh...!

34:19.830 --> 34:21.297
Where's the fire?

34:21.331 --> 34:22.598
Got to get to the hospital--
Daisy's having her baby.

34:22.632 --> 34:24.132
Oh, wow. That's fantastic.
Yeah.

34:24.168 --> 34:25.768
Okay, go, I'll hold
down the fort here.

34:25.803 --> 34:27.469
I've got plenty
to go over.

34:27.505 --> 34:30.105
Oh, g-g-good, is that the kid's
manuscript on Lawrence Brooks?

34:30.141 --> 34:31.273
Yeah, I'm hoping
there's something in here

34:31.309 --> 34:32.808
that can point us
towards a suspect.

34:32.842 --> 34:33.976
I mean, there's got to be
somebody other than Donald

34:34.011 --> 34:35.744
that Brooks pissed off
in the last year or two.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.846
Great, see if anyone can place
Alexis Sherman

34:37.882 --> 34:39.114
at the fracking site.

34:39.150 --> 34:41.183
I got it covered.
Go get 'em, Uncle.

34:41.217 --> 34:43.217
Right.

34:43.254 --> 34:44.453
Okay.

34:44.487 --> 34:45.987
The baby's heartbeat
is strong, Daisy,

34:46.023 --> 34:47.489
and you're progressing nicely.

34:47.525 --> 34:48.525
Shouldn't be much longer.

34:48.559 --> 34:51.025
Thank you, I-- aah!

34:52.196 --> 34:54.862
Whoa. That is quite a set
of lungs you got there.

34:54.899 --> 34:55.998
Oh, thank goodness you made it.

34:56.033 --> 34:57.466
It wouldn't feel right
if you missed this.

34:57.501 --> 34:58.834
Right, 'cause,
you know,

34:58.869 --> 35:00.569
I've never seen this many
spectators at a birth.

35:00.604 --> 35:03.105
That's 'cause
we're like family, right?

35:03.140 --> 35:05.541
Absolutely right.
You know what, and as, uh...

35:05.576 --> 35:07.476
as family, I should go
in the waiting room.

35:07.511 --> 35:09.878
No, no, you have to be here.

35:09.914 --> 35:11.447
You all have to be right here.

35:11.482 --> 35:13.182
We are not going to leave,
sweetie.

35:13.217 --> 35:14.583
There's no place else
we'd rather be.

35:14.618 --> 35:17.319
Booth?

35:17.355 --> 35:20.122
Right, right, you're so right.

35:20.157 --> 35:22.891
Okay, you know what,
let's do this.

35:22.927 --> 35:24.526
Oh!
When is the anesthesiologist

35:24.562 --> 35:26.328
going to get here?

35:26.364 --> 35:28.097
Oh, I'm afraid it's too late for
us to administer an epidural.

35:28.132 --> 35:29.298
What?!

35:29.333 --> 35:30.733
It could be dangerous
at this point.

35:32.636 --> 35:34.703
I'll go tell the doctor
how you're doing.

35:34.739 --> 35:36.005
I could come and help.
Right.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no.

35:37.775 --> 35:39.575
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.
Ms. Wick, we still have

35:39.610 --> 35:41.477
a murderer to catch-- I think
you should focus on the case.

35:41.512 --> 35:42.845
What are our findings
thus far?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.980
No, Bones, this is really not
the time to talk about this.

35:45.016 --> 35:47.049
Okay, okay, okay.

35:47.084 --> 35:48.817
We know that the cause of death
is a broken neck.

35:48.853 --> 35:50.486
Oh, oh, another contraction.

35:50.521 --> 35:51.820
Oh...!
Focus, Ms. Wick.

35:51.856 --> 35:53.355
What else about the victim?

35:53.391 --> 35:55.424
Um, no defensive wounds,

35:55.459 --> 35:56.925
offensive injuries only.

35:56.961 --> 35:58.360
As fragile as his bones were,

35:58.396 --> 35:59.762
we know there should've been
something more

35:59.797 --> 36:00.896
than just a neck break.

36:00.931 --> 36:02.364
We know he was bleeding.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.932
Oh...!

36:03.968 --> 36:05.334
So, he wasn't attacked?

36:05.369 --> 36:06.869
That means that his killer
could've been defending himself.

36:06.904 --> 36:09.038
I mean, maybe this is
self-defense and not a murder.

36:09.073 --> 36:11.774
Oh! I have to push.
Good point, good-good...

36:11.809 --> 36:14.009
I have to push. Pushing!

36:14.045 --> 36:16.045
Not until the doctor
tells you to.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.313
No, no, that's how the victim's
neck was broken.

36:18.349 --> 36:19.815
No, it wasn't snapped.

36:19.850 --> 36:21.583
Someone pushed him and he fell.

36:21.619 --> 36:23.919
With the drugs
compromising his bones,

36:23.954 --> 36:27.623
a bad fall would've resulted in
the same neural arch fractures.

36:27.658 --> 36:29.391
Blood. Bleeding.

36:29.427 --> 36:31.560
Oh, my God, this hurts.

36:31.595 --> 36:32.761
You're not bleeding, Ms. Wick.

36:32.797 --> 36:33.929
No, not me.

36:33.964 --> 36:34.997
His blood.

36:35.032 --> 36:36.498
If all the injuries
were offensive

36:36.534 --> 36:38.000
and he was just pushed,

36:38.035 --> 36:40.069
the blood wasn't
from the victim.

36:40.104 --> 36:42.037
It was from the killer.

36:42.073 --> 36:43.472
Okay, but the blood
was a match.

36:43.507 --> 36:46.575
So you need to concentrate
on your breathing.

36:46.610 --> 36:48.210
No, it was only a partial match.

36:48.245 --> 36:50.446
Fathers and sons can have
identical homozygotes.

36:50.481 --> 36:53.015
The victim's parents are dead
and he had no children.

36:53.050 --> 36:55.784
Okay, who here has the balls
to argue with a pregnant woman?

36:55.820 --> 36:57.252
It's the only explanation.

36:57.288 --> 36:58.587
The victim

36:58.622 --> 37:00.823
- has to have a son!
- The book!

37:00.858 --> 37:02.424
The answer's got
to be in the book.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.226
I'll-I'll call Aubrey.
This is... this is good.

37:04.261 --> 37:06.328
This is perfect.
You might've solved the case, Ms. Wick.

37:06.363 --> 37:08.730
But I actually <i> really</i> need
to push now.

37:08.766 --> 37:10.466
Like <i> really</i> need to push.

37:10.501 --> 37:13.068
And how are we doing now,
Daisy?

37:13.104 --> 37:15.437
Oh...!
Okay then.

37:19.110 --> 37:20.876
I found it, Agent Booth.

37:20.911 --> 37:23.078
When Brooks was in college,
he got his girlfriend pregnant,

37:23.114 --> 37:24.713
but he had to give the baby up
for adoption

37:24.748 --> 37:26.548
after his girlfriend died
during childbirth.

37:26.584 --> 37:28.417
A son?

37:28.452 --> 37:29.785
Yeah.

37:29.820 --> 37:30.953
What?

37:30.988 --> 37:33.288
Sounds like things are going
well at your end.

37:33.324 --> 37:34.556
Yeah, everything is...

37:34.592 --> 37:35.958
is going good.
Listen, just, you know what,

37:35.993 --> 37:38.393
get a warrant so you can unseal
the adoption records.

37:38.429 --> 37:40.062
Already did it.

37:40.097 --> 37:41.430
Agent Booth!
Look, I gotta go.

37:41.465 --> 37:42.698
All right? Just good luck.

37:42.733 --> 37:45.100
You, too.

37:45.136 --> 37:46.335
What'd I miss? Is it out?

37:46.370 --> 37:49.004
Just more screaming.

37:49.039 --> 37:51.607
Oh...!

37:55.246 --> 37:57.546
When my parents died,

37:57.581 --> 38:00.682
I found my adoption paperwork
in their things.

38:00.718 --> 38:05.821
So, writing the book was
a way to get to know Brooks.

38:05.856 --> 38:08.724
He was all I had left.

38:08.759 --> 38:11.426
I never meant to hurt him.

38:11.462 --> 38:13.562
Well, then, what happened?

38:13.597 --> 38:16.532
I finally found the courage
to call,

38:16.567 --> 38:19.668
and I told him I was his son.

38:19.703 --> 38:24.439
And he actually seemed happy
to hear from me.

38:24.475 --> 38:28.443
So we agreed to meet at a café
down the street from his house.

38:28.479 --> 38:31.547
How did you get from a café
to a fracking site?

38:31.582 --> 38:34.516
He never showed up to the café.

38:34.552 --> 38:36.985
I waited over an hour.

38:37.021 --> 38:39.054
Then I circled back
to Lawrence's house,

38:39.089 --> 38:40.822
saw him leaving on a walk.

38:40.858 --> 38:43.792
So I followed
and confronted him.

38:43.827 --> 38:46.862
But Brooks had no idea
who you were.

38:48.699 --> 38:52.401
He wouldn't even acknowledge
that we had spoke.

38:53.504 --> 38:55.270
I was hurt.

38:55.306 --> 38:58.874
We're flesh and blood,
so I asked him

38:58.909 --> 39:01.510
why he was messing with me,
and he freaked.

39:01.545 --> 39:04.546
He started attacking me,
hitting me, kicking.

39:04.582 --> 39:07.416
So you shoved him
to get him off you.

39:08.552 --> 39:10.219
Yeah.

39:10.254 --> 39:14.990
And then...
he-he fell down the hill,

39:15.025 --> 39:17.392
must've landed wrong, I guess.

39:19.663 --> 39:22.264
I didn't mean to kill him.

39:22.299 --> 39:25.133
I-I was scared...

39:25.169 --> 39:28.537
so I-I put him in the pit.

39:28.572 --> 39:32.908
And then you poured acid in
to make sure the body dissolved.

39:34.044 --> 39:36.678
I was scared.

39:36.714 --> 39:39.648
If he hated the idea
of seeing me,

39:39.683 --> 39:41.250
he could've just said so.

39:41.285 --> 39:43.452
I-I wouldn't have pushed it.

39:43.487 --> 39:45.254
He probably didn't remember
that he talked to you.

39:45.289 --> 39:47.856
It was the same day.

39:50.828 --> 39:53.996
He had Alzheimer's, Emory.

39:55.165 --> 39:57.899
What?

40:01.505 --> 40:04.306
Oh, God.

40:07.478 --> 40:11.446
I could've helped him.

40:11.482 --> 40:14.816
I... I would've been a good son.

40:14.852 --> 40:17.753
I would've helped him.

41:05.536 --> 41:07.436
He's beautiful.

41:07.471 --> 41:09.871
Absolutely perfect.

41:09.907 --> 41:11.707
You did it.

41:15.212 --> 41:17.746
He looks like Lance, doesn't he?

41:17.781 --> 41:20.349
I-I'm not imagining that, am I?

41:20.384 --> 41:22.384
No.

41:22.419 --> 41:23.719
No, he really does.

41:23.754 --> 41:25.587
What's his name?

41:26.857 --> 41:30.359
Lance insisted that his
first name be Seeley.

41:31.428 --> 41:36.098
So he's Seeley Lance
Wick-Sweets.

41:41.271 --> 41:43.972
Do you want to be
the first to hold him?

41:44.007 --> 41:46.441
Lance would want you
to be the first.

41:46.477 --> 41:49.044
Yeah.

41:51.815 --> 41:53.115
Hey.

41:53.150 --> 41:54.716
Hey there,
little buddy.

41:54.752 --> 41:56.051
How are you?

41:56.086 --> 42:00.122
Look at that, your whole family
came out to meet you.

42:01.325 --> 42:03.692
Hey...

42:03.727 --> 42:06.461
Look at this, huh?

42:06.497 --> 42:08.263
Look at that.
Hey, little buddy.

42:08.298 --> 42:10.265
Hey, little buddy.
There you go.

42:11.179 --> 42:13.813
Listen, I knew your dad.
