WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:04.878
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold?

00:05.046 --> 00:07.423
I was supposed to call my dad back,
like, two hours ago.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.091
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.218
He said call him as soon
as you get a chance.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.762
- He's at Flimbees.
- What's Flimbees?

00:13.930 --> 00:16.974
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use
when I can't remember the real thing.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.978
Okay, hang up. That's it. Come on.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.397
No. Rachel,
that's what they want me to do.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.233
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through...

00:26.401 --> 00:29.111
...they're not gonna fix my crappy,
broken phone for free.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.447
We cannot let them win.
It's us versus them.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.115
Yes.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.577
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.580
Uh, listen, I gotta double-check
for tickets tonight. Who got what?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.248
I have one.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.959
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.461
My boyfriend.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.590
I have a boyfriend now.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.550
Two it is. Ross, how about you?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.845
Uh, yeah, I, uh... I also need two.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.556
Really? Who's number two?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.016
Whose Number Two?

00:59.184 --> 01:02.227
One of the more difficult games
sewer workers play.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.273
Uh, no one, it's just this person.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.400
Like a date-type person?

01:08.777 --> 01:11.528
Yeah, kind of.
Uh, it's this woman from work.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.948
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

01:15.116 --> 01:18.911
No. No, not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself so...

01:19.454 --> 01:21.872
But you said one ticket.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.127
I meant me plus one.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.297
Okay. Did, uh, you guys mean
you plus one?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.426
- All right. I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.886
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.304
Bye-bye.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.889
Okay, I need a date.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.353
Oh, hey. You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.106
And I, uh, borrowed some of your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.066
What are you doing?
That's never gonna happen.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.569
- She's seeing somebody.
- Yeah. And I don't have any cologne.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.949
- Green bottle next to the shaving cream.
- Oh. Worm medicine for the duck.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.003
- Here you go. You can wear this.
- Thanks.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.005
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.634
Oh, I'm setting the phone down.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.220
But I'm still here.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.348
Just don't go anywhere. I'm still here.

03:03.516 --> 03:07.603
Don't switch or anything,
because I'm right here. Just one sec.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.565
One sec. One second.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.401
- Wait. One second. Just...
- Phoebe?

03:14.569 --> 03:16.904
What? Monica, I'm scared.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.991
Okay. Honey, that's a sleeve, okay?

03:21.159 --> 03:23.702
And we also have speakerphone.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.704
Please stay on the line.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.206
Your call is important to us.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.416
You gotta hang up.
Because we're gonna be late.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.461
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.297
Yes. Yes. I'm the next caller.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.841
You were gonna have me hang up.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.969
Hey.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.847
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

03:45.183 --> 03:46.516
- Of course not.
- No.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.770
Okay, I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.905
- Hey. Hey, Rach. Hi.
- Oh, hi, how are you?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.532
- Good.
- Hey. Ha, ha.

04:02.700 --> 04:06.161
- Ahem. Looks like we're the first ones here.
- Yeah, looks that way.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.537
First ones here.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.210
Hmm. Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.004
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin. Cailin...

04:16.172 --> 04:17.798
- Sorry.
- Oh.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.757
- And break.
Ha-ha-ha.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.514
Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.433
- Okay. I'll get our seats.
- I'll join you.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.354
So, uh... Well, this is, uh...

04:32.522 --> 04:33.855
This is awkward.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.190
Yeah?

04:35.358 --> 04:38.151
Well, you know, because Rachel and I
used to go out. Ha, ha.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.945
Oh, I didn't know that.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.697
Oh.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.992
Well, then this is awkward.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.705
- So, what do you? Oh. Yeah.
- I think we're here. Yeah.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.331
Uh. Huh.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.292
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.877
I think you may be in our seats.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.256
Um, no, I don't think so.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.259
- Could we take a look at your ticket?
- Sure.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.722
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13."

05:06.889 --> 05:09.516
- And...
- Oh, well, I thought that...

05:09.684 --> 05:13.979
You thought, huh? Yeah, well, that didn't
really work out too well for you. Idiot!

05:15.064 --> 05:18.608
What are you, a moron? Huh?
It says, "D-13." Okay?

05:18.901 --> 05:21.987
Look, you're surrounded by even numbers.
Does that give you some clue?

05:22.447 --> 05:25.407
- Well, the usher told me...
- Oh. Oh, the usher must be right.

05:25.575 --> 05:29.244
What, with all his training they go through.
Get out!

05:29.746 --> 05:31.204
Here.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.252
- Hey, man, you want the aisle?
- No, I'm good.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.266
- There he is.
- There's our star.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.018
You were great.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.519
So? So? What'd you think?

05:54.687 --> 05:58.648
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.651
- I wasn't in that.
- I know.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.906
Hey, Kate, listen I want you to meet
everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.201
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart.
- Hi.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.746
Come.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.460
So that's the girl you like.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.382
I'm telling you,
this guy Rachel is with is crazy, okay?

06:23.549 --> 06:26.259
He viciously screamed at total strangers.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.720
I think he's bad news.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.683
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?

06:33.851 --> 06:35.018
Well, that's odd.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.773
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys,
this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.943
- Hi.
- Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.987
Oh, yeah. I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

06:46.155 --> 06:50.200
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.662
So how'd you guys meet?

06:54.539 --> 06:58.125
Well, uh, the short version is,
I pursued her for a couple of months.

06:58.292 --> 07:01.294
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.467
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.221
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.516
Hey, you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.892
How do you do?

07:16.060 --> 07:19.521
Oh, you two girls were outstanding.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.982
Do they have representation?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.526
They weren't in the play.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.404
- Huh. We're not actors.
- Oh. What a shame.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.031
Because with her face
and her chest...

07:30.199 --> 07:31.950
...I could really put something together.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.163
Could I borrow it?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.459
Hi. Remember me?

07:40.626 --> 07:43.503
Hi. Yeah. Ahem, Tommy's in line
for the bathroom...

07:43.671 --> 07:46.631
...and someone just cut in front of him.
I think he's gonna snap.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.178
- Ross, I'm gonna go.
- Go? Why?

07:51.345 --> 07:53.889
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like...

07:54.056 --> 07:57.476
...standing around all night, waiting
for some guy who may or may not scream.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.061
Oh, but Cailin...

08:00.229 --> 08:02.230
...he definitely will scream.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.524
Goodbye, Ross.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.735
Oh, go, all right.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.114
Here we go, people.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.289
Ahem, "Boxing Day.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.416
The Lucille Lortel Theatre..."

08:21.626 --> 08:23.418
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da. Aha.

08:23.586 --> 08:28.548
"Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.968
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production."

08:32.135 --> 08:34.429
Yes. Ha-ha-ha!

08:36.807 --> 08:41.227
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable."

08:41.395 --> 08:42.729
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, aha!

08:42.897 --> 08:44.814
Here it is. "The direction...

08:44.982 --> 08:48.276
...by Marshall Townend is..."

08:54.534 --> 08:56.576
Thank you, boys and girls.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.120
You've ruined my life.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.749
Please stuff your talentless faces...

09:02.917 --> 09:06.253
...with my mother's crab cakes.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.255
Excuse me.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.845
Does anyone mind if I save this?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.767
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.852
- Oh, is the play over?
- Yeah, where were you?

09:23.020 --> 09:25.063
Thank you for your patience.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.190
You're the next caller.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.027
You were the next caller five hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

09:31.195 --> 09:34.114
No, I've kept myself busy.

09:41.789 --> 09:45.041
Oh, okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.881
Hey.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.174
You okay?

09:54.510 --> 09:55.510
Fabulous.

09:55.886 --> 10:00.765
Listen, drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.226
- You know what you should do?
- Become a drama critic.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.233
I am hurt.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.195
A plague...

10:14.363 --> 10:17.198
...on both your houses.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.746
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.706
Oh, classy.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.791
Yep.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.252
I sure know how to pick them, huh?

10:30.421 --> 10:32.589
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

10:33.174 --> 10:34.424
Wow.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.719
Yeah, I, uh... I gave up a job too.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.764
- Really? What?
- Uh, declawing cats.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.560
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.939
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of their Times and The Post.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.525
- Why The Post?
- You didn't see The Post?

10:52.693 --> 10:55.612
- No. You?
- No. Why?

11:02.912 --> 11:05.997
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.376
Oh, absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.462
Aw, you're sweet and cute.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.048
I know. That's why they trashed me.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.474
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.186
I don't get you.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.438
I mean, first you hate me.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.566
Then you sleep with me.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.653
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.447
What? So you never went out
with an actress before?

11:40.866 --> 11:43.660
Kate, do you even like me?

11:46.455 --> 11:50.166
- Of course I do.
- So how come you blew me off?

11:50.334 --> 11:53.962
- You know, how come you were with him?
- I don't know.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.506
I just do this.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.551
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy...

11:59.719 --> 12:02.303
...or the most talented guy.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.390
Why can't I just pick someone like you?

12:08.477 --> 12:09.978
Thanks.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.898
You know what I mean.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.944
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.655
Joey, you're just so...

12:22.366 --> 12:24.075
You're so...

12:24.869 --> 12:26.244
...so...

12:34.086 --> 12:36.838
Okay. Okay, okay. Ha, ha.

12:37.673 --> 12:41.009
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.893
Good night, Kate.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.479
Sweet dreams.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.489
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.916
Please stay on the line.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.210
Your call is very important to us.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.798
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep, honey.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.967
- This isn't healthy.
- No, no, I'm fine.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.638
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.059
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.062
Didn't you have that outfit on last night?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.856
Yeah. I stayed at Kate's,
but, uh, nothing happened.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.651
Hey, Pheebs, where were you?

13:39.819 --> 13:43.571
I'm so, so sorry, Joey.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.367
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.328
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.666
- Anyway, how'd it go with Kate?
- Oh, it was great.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.251
Yeah, I walked her home...

13:56.418 --> 13:59.712
...and it was amazing
how much we connected, you know?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.422
Then she passed out.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.299
But then she woke up. Yeah.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.385
And we stayed up all night talking.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.263
And now we're, like, totally crazy
about each other.

14:08.764 --> 14:12.350
- Joey, you had "the night."
- What?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.270
When two people finally realize
their feelings for each other...

14:15.437 --> 14:19.274
...and they talk for hours and they learn
all about the other person.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.483
You think?

14:20.651 --> 14:23.611
- Ha, ha. Did you learn about her family?
- Two brothers. One died.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.613
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.997
This is from the woman at the bar.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.748
Oh.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.546
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.926
- What time is it?
- One.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.678
Seven-fifteen.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.722
Watch doesn't work.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.310
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.691
Look. Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but...

15:01.859 --> 15:05.528
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

15:06.655 --> 15:07.864
- You don't?
- No.

15:08.032 --> 15:12.452
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.998
Hmm. Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.667
No, it's not just because I'm jealous.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.255
I mean, I'm not, I'm not.
I'm not jealous, okay?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.965
Look, the guy, he screamed...

15:26.133 --> 15:29.010
...he actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.846
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he...

15:32.014 --> 15:36.809
He got up, you know, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.023
Okay, fine. Fine. You don't want
to believe me, no, that's fine.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.943
- We're kidding. Ross.
- Ross. Ross.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.988
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.198
- Whoa.
- Sorry, Tommy.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.367
What's in the cup, Ross?

15:53.535 --> 15:56.204
- Um.
- What is in the cup?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.538
Okay, it's coffee.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.041
Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.712
- It's hot...
- Hot coffee!

16:04.880 --> 16:08.508
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

16:08.676 --> 16:12.428
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

16:12.596 --> 16:14.389
Huh? Huh?

16:17.559 --> 16:19.811
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

16:19.979 --> 16:23.898
Hmm, going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.400
Yeah.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.028
- Hey.
- Tommy.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.364
Say, what's your favorite thing
about summer?

16:31.532 --> 16:35.535
Ooh, I don't know.
Probably the, uh, smell of freshly cut grass.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.578
- Aw, that's a good one.
- Yeah.

16:42.418 --> 16:46.504
Hey, sorry. Sorry I'm late. My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.382
- Look, we held the curtain for you. Let's go.
- Okay.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.433
Vic. Where have you been, baby?

17:02.229 --> 17:04.731
- Where's Kate?
- She got a job in L.A.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.066
What?

17:07.608 --> 17:12.446
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.782
Where have you been, Vic?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.286
Oh, uh... Go to the window.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.664
I wanna run down to the truck
and show you something.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.461
What do you got down there, Vic?

17:26.627 --> 17:28.421
What do you got under that tarp?

17:32.342 --> 17:33.426
When is she leaving?

17:33.802 --> 17:36.345
Tonight. What are you doing?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.807
I'm coming up.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.479
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

17:50.152 --> 17:52.862
Why don't you use ours across the hall
because she...

17:53.030 --> 17:54.447
...has problems.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.948
Thanks.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.659
Whoa. Whoa.

17:58.827 --> 18:02.747
Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled
this hot coffee on you.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.666
Ha, ha. Yeah, but you didn't. Ha, ha.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.669
No, but it's hot.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.134
Ross, would you just stop it?
It's getting really old.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.345
I can't believe no one believes me.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.097
I do. I believe you.

18:19.556 --> 18:20.640
You do, Pheebs?

18:20.808 --> 18:24.185
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.859
Ooh, hey.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.820
Hey there, little fella.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.364
Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how you doing?

18:36.532 --> 18:40.368
Aw. Aw, ew. Oh. Ew.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.203
Gross.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.122
Idiot!

18:44.289 --> 18:47.333
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

18:47.501 --> 18:51.462
"Oh, look at me. I'm so cute.
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"

18:51.630 --> 18:54.132
God, you're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

18:57.386 --> 18:59.303
What are you quacking about?

18:59.471 --> 19:01.055
Dumb Donald Dodo!

19:05.269 --> 19:07.895
Step away from the duck.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.192
Ooh, sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.736
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

19:18.407 --> 19:20.575
Well, I guess we're not
going out anymore.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.118
Man!

19:26.248 --> 19:27.748
- Joey.
- Kate.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.959
I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.336
What's going on?
What's all this about L. A?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.589
They still want me for General Hospital.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.550
But what about us?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.679
Last night was wonderful.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.098
But I can't stay here just for you.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.101
Well, so stay for the museums.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.354
- I'm sorry.
- Joey, on-stage.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.274
Well, can you stay
till the end of the play?

19:53.442 --> 19:56.277
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.362
Where are you, Vic?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.698
Flight's in an hour. I gotta go.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.325
Vic?

20:02.492 --> 20:03.910
Vic?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.455
- Vic!
- In a minute.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.959
So this is it, Victor?

20:12.794 --> 20:15.755
Yeah. I guess it is.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.639
Listen, I, uh...

20:24.932 --> 20:28.643
I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

20:29.311 --> 20:33.898
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

20:34.149 --> 20:37.360
But you got things you have to do now.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.320
And so do I.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.531
And so...

20:44.493 --> 20:46.953
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

20:54.336 --> 20:57.797
...and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.177
But when I return
200 years from now...

21:03.345 --> 21:05.471
...you'll be long gone...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.557
...but I won't have aged at all.

21:11.853 --> 21:15.564
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter...

21:15.732 --> 21:16.899
...to look me up.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.070
Because, Adrianne...

21:21.238 --> 21:22.780
...baby...

21:24.408 --> 21:26.534
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.585
So long, Vic.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.345
Phoebe, it's been two days.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.055
Yeah, I know.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.225
Ugh, good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

21:51.393 --> 21:56.480
Phoebe, 800 is toll free. 801 is Utah.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.192
No, no, no.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.863
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.406
Every...

22:05.741 --> 22:09.201
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.578
Phoebe.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.831
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I will pay you back.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.834
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.711
- Hang up.
- Hang up the phone.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.421
Fine. Fine.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.381
Oh. Oh.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.510
What?

22:27.888 --> 22:30.348
Well, I think I broke it.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.602
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.103
Oh.
