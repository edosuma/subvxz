WEBVTT

00:04.879 --> 00:06.088
Okay, this is it.

00:06.923 --> 00:08.382
You sure you wanna do this?

00:12.303 --> 00:14.847
Hello, Mrs. Ross. Woo-hoo!

00:15.098 --> 00:18.267
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.277
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.238
Come on, Pheebs, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.157
Okay! Okay!

00:35.201 --> 00:37.995
Oh, my God!
Is everybody getting married?

00:39.914 --> 00:42.750
- Agh.
- No running in the chapel.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.919
Hey, don't you give me
any of your... Hey!

00:46.087 --> 00:47.588
- Hi.
- Hey!

00:47.756 --> 00:49.006
What are you doing here?

00:49.174 --> 00:52.426
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.511
- Isn't that why you guys are here?
- Yes.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.847
- Why else would we be here?
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.769
Well, what happened? Did we miss it?

01:01.936 --> 01:03.312
We actually missed it.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.648
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

01:07.734 --> 01:08.984
This is insane.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.154
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.156
What?

01:15.200 --> 01:18.160
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.248
What? If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.583
Really?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.251
Yeah.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.962
Oh, my God.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.882
Oh, well.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.264
Mm.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.127
Why are we in bed together?

02:50.336 --> 02:51.628
I don't know.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.841
Do you have any clothes on?

02:56.676 --> 02:57.718
Yes.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.178
- Really?
- No.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.804
Ugh...

03:02.974 --> 03:05.225
But we didn't have...

03:06.519 --> 03:08.770
...sex, did we?

03:10.773 --> 03:13.317
I don't remember much about last night.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.737
- It was such a blur. Ha, ha.
- Oh.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.113
Oh!

03:18.281 --> 03:21.283
- I remember laughing. I laughed a lot.
- Uh-huh?

03:21.451 --> 03:22.868
Then we didn't have sex.

03:27.790 --> 03:31.168
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.170
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.005
Tell me about it.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.179
- Morning, Pheebs.
- Mm.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.933
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.769
Mm. Joey, I'm so sorry.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.187
You want my breakfast?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.898
Eh, too depressed to eat.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.442
I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.404
So I guess I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

03:59.572 --> 04:02.199
- What about my cab?
- I don't need that anymore.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.036
No, you borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.289
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.042
Oh, ooh. How about if you come with me?

04:12.210 --> 04:14.544
- I don't know, it's a long trip.
- That would be great.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.172
We could talk and play games.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.385
This could be our chance to,
like, renew our friendship.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.097
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

04:26.849 --> 04:27.975
Sure?

04:28.142 --> 04:33.272
Heh. All right, although I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.066
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.276
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.028
So has anybody talked
to Dr. And Mrs. Geller yet?

04:40.196 --> 04:43.240
Mm-hm. They left me a message.
They'll be here.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.701
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.871
It's a buffet, man.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.542
Here's where I win all my money back!

04:56.212 --> 04:57.462
I gotta talk to you.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.714
Sure.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.090
What's up?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.851
Monica and I almost got married.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.477
My God!

05:12.687 --> 05:15.314
That's huge! Ha-ha-ha, hey.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.900
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

05:19.861 --> 05:24.114
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.660
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her...

05:28.911 --> 05:32.372
...but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel...

05:32.582 --> 05:37.586
...was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.881
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.549
Oh!

05:43.217 --> 05:45.510
Tell her she's not marriage material.

05:47.805 --> 05:48.847
What?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.476
Girls say it to me all the time.

05:54.645 --> 05:58.440
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.611
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

06:02.820 --> 06:05.238
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.741
- Well, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.868
Good. I was just testing you.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.246
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.582
We were just talking about bacon.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.043
No, we were talking about tennis.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.504
Tennis is more believable.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.092
Hey.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.302
- Hi.
- Thank you.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.390
- Coffee. Heh.
- Mm.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.482
- What?
- Are we gonna talk...

06:40.650 --> 06:42.859
...about what you guys did last night,
or?

06:45.029 --> 06:48.490
What do you mean "last night"?
Nothing, uh, happened last night.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.993
Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.249
Rach, we weren't gonna miss
our friends marrying.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.334
Huh, who got married?

07:01.504 --> 07:02.921
You did?

07:03.673 --> 07:05.173
- What?
- Heh.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.927
- Wh...? Hello. We didn't get married.
- No, we didn't. That's ridi...

07:14.559 --> 07:17.477
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.148
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.400
They let you get married.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.819
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.156
Heh, I'm drunk right now.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.786
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.621
What are you gonna do?

07:36.831 --> 07:39.249
- Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.586
Well, I think,
I think Ross already has one.

07:45.339 --> 07:46.798
Now, this one's free, right?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.384
Because you paid for the first two,
third one free.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.304
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

07:52.513 --> 07:55.015
...because we don't need to get divorced.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.059
- We're just gonna get an annulment.
- An annulment?

07:58.269 --> 08:01.730
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.859
Oh, that's your thing!

08:06.861 --> 08:07.944
What?

08:09.030 --> 08:12.157
Your thing, that you're the guy
who gets divorced.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.825
Oh, yeah.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.453
No, no, that's not "my thing."

08:17.121 --> 08:19.164
I do not love getting divorced.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.751
Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.588
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it...

08:28.633 --> 08:31.801
...and then it won't work out, so you're
gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.595
Ha-ha-ha.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.472
I'm so drunk.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.524
- So, what should we do?
- I don't know.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.400
I know I love you.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.528
- I know I love you.
- Heh.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.660
Where are we on the whole
"going back...

08:56.869 --> 08:59.871
...to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.374
That's a good question.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.418
Last night we let the dice decide.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.588
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

09:08.756 --> 09:11.383
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.176
Okay? So say, uh...

09:13.344 --> 09:17.430
You roll another eight, then there's a sign
that we should get married.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.224
All right. Eight we get married...

09:19.392 --> 09:23.770
...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,
11, 12, we don't get married.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.105
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.148
Hey, we got a shooter.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.692
Money, please.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.943
- Ready?
- Ready.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.987
Come on, eight.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.075
Yes, yes, eight.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.954
Eight, easy eight.

09:43.374 --> 09:47.627
- Wow, I can't believe I rolled an eight.
- That was so unlikely.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.841
- Well, let's get married. I guess.
- Aah.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.510
That wasn't hard.
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.638
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

09:58.806 --> 10:02.100
- Agh! Aah!
- Unh, I wanted it so bad!

10:04.937 --> 10:05.979
- Wanna go pack?
- Yeah.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.068
- We're doing the right thing, right?
- Oh, of course we are.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.446
Heh, we left it up to fate.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.283
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

10:25.791 --> 10:30.170
Okay, you have 19 questions left.
Use them wisely.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.051
Come on, Joey.
You can't win if you don't ask any...

10:36.218 --> 10:37.260
...questions!

10:37.428 --> 10:39.471
Aah! Aah.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.058
- What?
- You promised me a fun road trip.

10:43.225 --> 10:46.936
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.398
We are switching,
and you are going to drive back.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.444
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.488
All right. All right.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.574
Yeah. And until then,
you are going to sing to me.

10:59.784 --> 11:04.120
Because the radio's broken, and you are
selfish, but you have a nice voice.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.623
- Really?
- Sing!

11:06.791 --> 11:12.462
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night

11:19.178 --> 11:21.721
Man, this is a long drive.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.599
Are my eyes open?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.309
No!

11:42.410 --> 11:43.702
- Morning.
- Aah!

11:50.334 --> 11:52.419
- Hey.
- Hey, hubby. Heh.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.966
Yeah. Actually, um,
I wanted to talk to you...

11:58.134 --> 12:00.552
...about that whole annulment thing.
- Uh-huh?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.804
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.610
- Okay.
- Heh.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.156
So we'll just stay married.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.657
Yes, exactly.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.661
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.956
Wow, this is so amazing.

12:30.124 --> 12:34.002
I, uh, really thought I'd have
to talk you into this more.

12:34.170 --> 12:39.007
Ha, ha. Now I'm scared because
I don't actually think you're kidding.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.093
I'm not kidding.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.803
Look, I... I... Heh.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.223
I can't have three failed marriages.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.058
I can't, okay?

12:49.226 --> 12:52.437
I am not gonna be that guy.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.735
So, what, we just stay married forever?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.445
Okay, how...?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.573
How is this going to affect you, really?

13:06.327 --> 13:09.537
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while...

13:09.747 --> 13:13.917
...instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs."

13:14.126 --> 13:17.045
It's right next to it.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.841
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.802
We can stay married...

13:24.011 --> 13:28.640
...because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.353
All right. Look, just...

13:33.562 --> 13:35.522
...please take a moment here...

13:35.731 --> 13:38.650
...and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

13:39.401 --> 13:44.072
I am asking you to do me a favor.

13:46.116 --> 13:49.911
You are asking me to be your wife.

13:50.120 --> 13:55.041
And, as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.089
That kid kicked me really hard.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.299
Well, you did pull his hair.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.845
- He took my snack.
- I'm not getting into this again.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.639
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.891
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.560
There. There. Okay.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.655
- This doesn't mean anything, does it?
- No.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.661
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

14:31.871 --> 14:36.499
He could be a rape... He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.419
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.922
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.592
- And, you, are you a rapist?
- No.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.510
Do you like car games?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.971
Yeah, you know the, uh,
license plate game?

14:50.139 --> 14:51.890
I love the license plate game!

14:52.057 --> 14:54.017
Ooh, I'll play. I'll play.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.269
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night. Shh.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.235
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.863
Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me...

15:07.031 --> 15:10.533
...but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.201
Uh...

15:12.369 --> 15:14.245
We register...

15:14.413 --> 15:17.040
...and you get to keep all the presents.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.880
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

15:24.048 --> 15:28.134
I've thought about how to tell you this,
and, um, the bottom line, Ross...

15:28.302 --> 15:30.929
...is we cannot stay married.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.808
- I don't know if that's true...
- Oh, but it is.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.436
Ahem. Okay. You know what this is?

15:38.604 --> 15:42.357
This is a difference of opinion.

15:44.526 --> 15:47.028
- When that happens in a marriage...
- Oh, Ross, come on!

15:47.196 --> 15:51.199
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

15:52.576 --> 15:55.662
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.542
All right. All right, I'll do it.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.127
Thank you.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.339
Hey, hey, um...

16:06.507 --> 16:10.093
...uh, is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

16:14.390 --> 16:16.766
There's the train station, where I get off.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.268
Well, I have your address
and phone number.

16:19.436 --> 16:22.563
And I have your name
and the fact that you're a drifter.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.566
So ball's pretty much in your court.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.152
All right. See you, Pheebs.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.414
Come on, Pheebs,
I can't take this anymore.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.873
Please talk to me.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.712
Let me make it up to you, huh?

16:46.839 --> 16:50.717
Ground control to Major Tom

16:52.219 --> 16:55.972
Commencing countdown
Engines on

16:58.392 --> 17:04.355
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on

17:04.522 --> 17:06.273
Pssh, this is...

17:06.442 --> 17:08.901
Stop it! Stop it! No.

17:10.069 --> 17:13.865
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.326
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.

17:17.493 --> 17:20.204
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend...

17:20.455 --> 17:23.124
...and I didn't deliver, okay?

17:23.333 --> 17:28.296
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

17:29.339 --> 17:33.342
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.556
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.059
Thank you.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.103
So can we play 20 Questions now?

17:44.313 --> 17:47.148
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.151
Okay.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.445
Is it...

17:52.654 --> 17:55.031
...a kind of hot sandwich?

17:55.699 --> 17:57.075
Yes.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.744
Is it a meatball sub?

17:59.995 --> 18:01.913
That is incredible!

18:02.414 --> 18:04.290
You are the master!

18:06.627 --> 18:08.377
Aah! Bug!

18:11.507 --> 18:14.425
- Ah! That's funny. You look like you're...
- Don't say it!

18:14.593 --> 18:16.302
Don't even think it.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.805
All right.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.640
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.729
Should we just get married?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.899
All the signs are telling us to do it.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.275
I'm sick of the signs.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.070
- I'm happy the way things are.
- Me too.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.072
- I don't want change, do you?
- No.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.534
All right then, nothing changes.
Everything stays the same!

18:39.701 --> 18:43.496
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it's driving me insane!

18:44.873 --> 18:47.917
Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar...
Aah, agh.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.762
You know, I was thinking, what if I, uh...

19:00.389 --> 19:01.806
...unpack here?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.724
All your stuff would be here.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.186
Well...

19:09.982 --> 19:11.816
What if all my stuff was here?

19:12.568 --> 19:15.319
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.655
Doesn't make any sense.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.490
Okay.

19:22.035 --> 19:25.204
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.126
Live together?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.628
There've been no signs for that.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.965
Me asking is kind of a sign.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.430
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Okay!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.852
Yes.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.229
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.481
- Okay.
- Here's your key. Here's your key.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.317
Now go out and christen it!

19:54.526 --> 19:55.943
Go out and come back in!

19:56.153 --> 19:58.696
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.782
- Ready?
- Ready!

20:03.368 --> 20:05.995
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.915
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

20:09.124 --> 20:11.792
- This isn't a sign!
- No, it's a very old key!

20:12.002 --> 20:14.337
- It's an old key!
- Oh, my God, it's old.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.422
I love you.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.967
I love you.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.721
Are you hugging the door right now?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.394
No.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.522
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.401
Hey.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.738
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

20:40.948 --> 20:43.866
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.368
Ross, thank you.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.621
Do you wanna go see a movie?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.623
- Yeah, why not?
- Pheebs?

20:50.832 --> 20:52.708
Thanks, I've already seen one.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.129
- Okay, um, I'm gonna get my sweater.
- Okay.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.385
You wanna hear something weird?

21:02.594 --> 21:03.970
Always.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.723
I didn't get the annulment.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.103
- What?
- We're still married.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.564
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

21:29.705 --> 21:30.746
What are you doing?

21:30.956 --> 21:32.456
Key is stuck in the lock.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.208
I can fix it. Hold on.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.753
Watch out, watch out.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.261
It still doesn't work.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.929
- I'm not finished.
- Oh.

21:57.941 --> 22:01.027
Nice job, Joe.
You are quite the craftsman.
