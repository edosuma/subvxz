WEBVTT

01:35.637 --> 01:36.680
Hey, come on…

01:40.017 --> 01:41.059
Quick! Quick!

01:44.688 --> 01:46.815
-It's not his fault, you gotta calm down.
-Go, go, go, ball in.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.027
Hey. Come on across court.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.236
-Go!
-Come on.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.615
Keep that ball up! Keep that ball up!

01:56.992 --> 01:58.076
Time-out. Time-out.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.496
Damn it!

02:01.580 --> 02:02.581
Run!

02:07.169 --> 02:11.924
Listen, all right? They are coming
for y'all, and they're not gonna stop.

02:12.007 --> 02:16.678
This right here comes with the territory.
Can you rise to the occasion?

02:17.179 --> 02:19.264
Subpoena Prep, welcome to New York.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.309
They been talking shit all day.

02:22.893 --> 02:26.313
Don't let it rattle you, okay? Use it.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.773
Nah, I got you Cedar Cove.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.566
-Justice by any means necessary.
-Yeah.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.027
Don't y'all want
Kings County Criminal Court?

02:32.110 --> 02:34.530
It's on Atlantic and Smith.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.533
Man, I'm sick of this shit!
Let's shut them down y'all.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.409
-That's right y'all, come on. Let's go.
-Yeah.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.370
"Shut 'em down" on three, one, two, three!

02:41.453 --> 02:43.205
-Shut 'em down!
-CJ, you're in for Musa.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.373
Let's go!

02:52.589 --> 02:53.590
Breathe.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.304
Now tie your shoes.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.808
-CJ, get to the corner!
-You got this, CJ.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.852
Go, Phil!

03:09.815 --> 03:10.858
Damn it, Drew.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.277
You're doing too much, bro. Too much.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.322
-Defense!
-Come on!

03:21.952 --> 03:24.246
No, no, no! No! No. No.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.207
-Yeah!
-No. CJ, look at me.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.852
Let's go.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.737
It's just some Internet rumor, Ma.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.618
In two weeks they'll be talking
about something else.

04:03.827 --> 04:04.953
I love you too.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.760
What's up, man?

04:21.762 --> 04:22.763
What up?

04:23.847 --> 04:25.015
Yeah, what happened today?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.061
We lost to a team that's not even top 25.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.731
I know how you feel.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.441
-Do you?
-Yeah.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.403
Not being able to help your team
down the stretch sucks.

04:39.571 --> 04:43.992
We didn't lose 'cause I didn't suit up.
We lost 'cause we're not a real team.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.410
-What?
-What you mean?

04:45.494 --> 04:48.038
Course we're a real team.
It was just a bad loss.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.873
They're calling us vigilantes,

04:51.416 --> 04:55.254
Crystal's henchmen, heroes, thugs.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.259
You got nothing to say about that?

05:00.342 --> 05:01.802
-Do you?
-No!

05:02.553 --> 05:05.055
-'Cause I have shit to do with it.
-Neither did we.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.395
I got the Puerto Rican national team
looking at me now.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.313
Do you know what that could mean for me?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.526
I'm fighting to come back
from this injury, man.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.945
I don't need scouts
questioning my character too.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.033
If you could just make this right--

05:25.117 --> 05:27.786
Like he said, it's not real.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.916
Man, whatever.

06:08.327 --> 06:13.457
Y'all are speculating about who beat up
Coach Warrick and who's responsible.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.628
So, here's the truth.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.217
I found out Warrick was messing
with his players…

06:26.553 --> 06:28.013
and I had to do something.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.307
I was 14.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.228
And I didn't know what else to do,

06:34.311 --> 06:39.149
so I got three guys from my old
neighborhood and took care of it.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.158
Crystal didn't ask me to do it.
She didn't even know about it.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.745
And my teammates, they weren't there.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.249
So now y'all can stop speculating.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.586
Stop all the heat you've been
putting on them. It wasn't them.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.639
It was me. Jace Carson.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.421
Mom?

09:07.923 --> 09:10.509
-Mom, I got something to tell you.
-Do you know what you've done?

09:13.637 --> 09:16.348
-I know.
-You admitted to a felony on TikTok.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.935
All the work you've done.
You were so close.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.271
-And you put it all at risk.
-I had to.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.692
Everyone was going after Crystal.
Going after my teammates.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.194
-They have nothing to do with it.
-You didn't think it through, Jace!

09:29.278 --> 09:31.738
-You never think it through.
-You taught me to respect women.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.532
I taught you to use common sense.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.120
Other athletes have done way worse
and still kept their scholarships,

09:38.203 --> 09:41.123
-still made it to the league.
-This is not just about basketball.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.043
You could go to jail.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.597
Why didn't you tell me what was happening?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.892
Crystal didn't want anybody
to know about it.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.769
But she also wanted it to stop.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.313
There were other ways.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.360
I never thought I'd be going through this
with you, Jace.

10:11.737 --> 10:12.821
Not like this.

10:12.905 --> 10:16.408
Mom, he was 14.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.161
It was Crystal.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.091
Who were the other three guys
from the neighborhood?

10:40.724 --> 10:42.351
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-Sorry, what?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.269
I--

10:47.231 --> 10:49.608
I can't tell you.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.521
You told me your solution
was to say nothing.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.316
-I saw what--
-That was the plan.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.277
I saw what people were saying about you.

11:34.111 --> 11:37.114
"Crystal's henchmen"
and all that bullshit.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.907
It would have died down.
People would have stopped.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.076
-No, it wouldn't.
-You made sure of that.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.579
I made sure they were talking
about me, not you.

11:44.162 --> 11:48.542
And you do realize there isn't
a "me" and a "you"? There can't be.

11:50.419 --> 11:51.962
When you say, "can't"--

11:52.045 --> 11:55.591
There can't be. You get that, right?

11:58.260 --> 11:59.261
I get that.

11:59.344 --> 12:02.389
Figure out how to save myself
so you can stop trying.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.728
Drop me off right here.
If we get any closer,

12:07.811 --> 12:09.855
I don't want anyone
from my school seeing us together.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.233
Bye, Jace.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.365
I told them it comes with the territory.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.117
But I don't think that's true.

12:22.201 --> 12:25.662
The way that they coming at the team.
Not just other kids, but adults too.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.080
They want Jace to topple.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.250
Then he turned around and lied to my face.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.711
Babe, Jace just turned 18.

12:33.212 --> 12:36.423
It's not personal. He's just trying
to figure out what it means to be a man.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.262
Look, Mommy, I'm flying.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.722
I see you, baby.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.643
-Okay, here we go.
-Hi. Good morning.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.852
-Hey, hey.
-Okay.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.562
We love you, baby, okay?

12:51.188 --> 12:52.523
Okay?

12:52.606 --> 12:53.607
-Love you.
-Go.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.733
Love you too.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.949
So what you think the reaction will be?

13:03.116 --> 13:07.663
At Cedar Cove? Think they'll think
that Jace did something stupid.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.083
But what do you think?

13:13.252 --> 13:14.753
I had a sociology professor

13:15.337 --> 13:19.049
who would explain how we often let
right and wrong occupy the same space,

13:20.425 --> 13:21.426
from a moral standpoint.

13:21.510 --> 13:25.013
Example, we say that killing is bad,
but we engage in war.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.850
So, do I think what Jace did was stupid?
Yes.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.894
But I also think he was right.

13:32.688 --> 13:38.026
Unfortunately, right and wrong
can't occupy the same space at Cedar Cove.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.364
I need to make sure
he's ready for the storm.

13:45.868 --> 13:52.416
Scouts, college coaches,
and your NIL opportunities--

13:54.126 --> 13:56.628
They're all gonna start to pull back.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.594
Damn.

14:05.888 --> 14:06.889
I'm sorry.

14:11.727 --> 14:15.480
Hilltop Central is one of the best teams
in the Chi.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.693
And they got two guys
ranked just below me.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.030
If I give 'em 40 on Friday,
they gonna be lining up again.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.374
Right now, do this for me.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.295
No more posts, no social.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.339
Don't talk to anyone.

14:40.422 --> 14:44.593
And keep your head down, please. Okay?

14:48.055 --> 14:48.889
Okay.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.191
And about you lying to me--

15:00.317 --> 15:01.777
I ain't feel like I had a choice.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.612
So you told TikTok instead?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.409
Why you ain't tell me?

15:11.161 --> 15:12.162
I just couldn't.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.131
Look.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.136
Don't blindside me again.

15:30.973 --> 15:31.974
No doubt.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.607
-Thank you for seeing me so quickly.
-Of course.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.361
Alonzo and I go back a ways.
Went to school together.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.071
I'm glad he connected us.

15:46.154 --> 15:50.409
And this is completely on my dime,
so you don't have to worry about anything.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.869
I'm grateful for both of you.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.997
I've seen Jace's admission.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.832
And while I haven't made any calls yet,

15:56.915 --> 15:58.750
I think
we can make a couple of assumptions.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.463
First, the police will officially reopen
the investigation into the incident.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.718
The second is that they are going to want
to question your son at some point.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.304
Now, Erika and I were talking
before you got in.

16:10.387 --> 16:14.183
So, it's important to remember
the context of all of this.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.018
It happened when Jace was a kid.

16:16.101 --> 16:19.104
Warrick was convicted
of assaulting little girls.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.024
And the district attorney
is not going to see this

16:22.107 --> 16:24.151
as a case to score political points.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.528
Jace is not only a good student,

16:26.612 --> 16:28.989
but he has community support, so--

16:29.072 --> 16:30.449
The most important thing right now

16:30.532 --> 16:32.951
is that you and Jace
don't talk to anyone else about this.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.955
Let me get into it and see
if the DA's office has a plan yet.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.333
Thank you.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.877
-Of course.
-You're welcome.

16:43.629 --> 16:46.548
"It is the problem of developing
the best of this race

16:47.341 --> 16:48.967
that they may guide the mass away

16:49.051 --> 16:52.596
from the contamination and death
of the worst."

16:53.722 --> 16:54.723
Du Bois said that.

16:55.432 --> 16:59.937
Jace isn't contaminating anyone.
He brought your program into prominence.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.272
And it could sink lower
than it has ever been.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.358
Listen, Ike.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.903
Six percent of the population
on this campus is African American.

17:07.986 --> 17:11.906
And I am not content with the numbers
of our people being admitted.

17:11.990 --> 17:16.662
The African American kids currently here
have to understand they are pioneers.

17:17.621 --> 17:22.751
They can open the door for more of us.
And they can just as easily close a door.

17:22.835 --> 17:26.338
You are the only coach at Cedar Cove
with a hue.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.717
If I mess up my job, you never get yours.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.264
You see? We stand on the shoulders
of each other.

17:36.265 --> 17:39.810
Jace stands on my shoulders.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.771
And I won't let him down.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.690
You need to see that.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.319
When did you first hear about the attack?

17:49.403 --> 17:53.365
-Same as you. When it hit the airwaves.
-Are any other players involved?

17:53.448 --> 17:55.117
According to Jace, no one.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.493
According to Jace?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.872
I'd like to question the other seniors.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.916
No. I'll handle that.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.712
I'll await your response. In the meantime,

18:06.795 --> 18:11.258
Jace Carson is suspended
from all basketball activities,

18:11.341 --> 18:13.051
games and practices.

18:13.135 --> 18:16.638
Everyone is watching
to see how we deal with this.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.599
Now is the time to stand with the kid.

18:18.682 --> 18:22.311
Our school's reputation is at stake!

18:22.394 --> 18:24.354
Jace's career is at stake!

18:24.438 --> 18:27.774
Cedar Cove
produces Pulitzer Prize winners,

18:27.858 --> 18:30.903
Academy Award winners, two winners
of the National Medal of Science,

18:30.986 --> 18:32.154
thousands of Ivy Leaguers!

18:34.740 --> 18:39.536
This school has never put athletics first,
for good reason.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.915
This from the school's Athletic Director?

18:44.708 --> 18:47.669
For all you know, I'm on the short list
to replace the head of school.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.051
That's your damn angle?

18:57.304 --> 19:00.516
People like you, they look straight ahead.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.851
I look up.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.438
What does Jace Carson need to do
to be reinstated?

19:09.441 --> 19:13.153
The board will meet
on the matter tomorrow.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.203
I'ma continue to appeal.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.665
But as of now, this is where things stand.

19:28.585 --> 19:29.837
For how long?

19:30.796 --> 19:32.840
School board is reviewing your case.

19:32.923 --> 19:35.092
I'm sorry but that's all I got.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.678
What are they going to say to the press?

19:37.761 --> 19:39.263
They haven't formed a statement yet.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.519
Jace, there's something I gotta ask.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.688
In the video you made,

19:48.313 --> 19:51.567
you said it was three guys
from your neighborhood that helped you?

19:56.113 --> 19:57.114
I'm tired.

20:00.450 --> 20:03.495
-I think you made it worse, Jace.
-Me too.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.956
Check my IG page and check yours.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.626
I'm the only one catching the heat.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.711
For now, bro.

20:11.503 --> 20:12.546
And what about the cops?

20:13.922 --> 20:15.215
If the cops get in the picture,

20:15.299 --> 20:19.970
all you need to know
is that I would never rat on y'all. Never.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.645
Still a question
we haven't asked ourselves.

20:31.273 --> 20:37.112
Y'all think what we did that night,
four years ago, was wrong?

20:40.574 --> 20:41.575
Knock, knock.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.537
-Yo.
-Yo, so what we talking about?

20:45.621 --> 20:46.622
Hooping.

20:46.705 --> 20:49.208
Yeah? What about it?

20:49.291 --> 20:52.127
I was just about to tell them
I'm suspended.

20:53.629 --> 20:56.840
No games, no practices.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.223
-For how long?
-I don't know.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.977
How are we supposed to beat
Hilltop Central without you?

21:11.313 --> 21:14.775
Hey, doc cleared me. I got y'all.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.576
Drea. Hey.

21:24.660 --> 21:25.661
Hi, Drew.

21:26.745 --> 21:29.122
It was fun
getting to know you at that party.

21:29.206 --> 21:33.669
-It was. Look--
-Is something wrong?

21:36.171 --> 21:38.423
I heard some things
about you and your teammates.

21:39.591 --> 21:40.717
How you might be trouble.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.845
Look, I don't get caught up
in what people say.

21:45.556 --> 21:47.391
I'm not one of these rich-ass kids, Drew.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.601
I'm part scholarship, part financial aid.

21:49.685 --> 21:52.062
I take two buses to get to Cedar Cove.

21:52.855 --> 21:55.691
And I avoid guys in my neighborhood
who are trouble.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.860
So I'm not trying to link up
with someone from my prep school--

21:57.943 --> 21:59.570
And I'm not one who plays games.

22:00.904 --> 22:04.199
I'm not trouble. I think you know that.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.582
Can I take you out after the game?

22:14.459 --> 22:16.461
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.798
Aren't there enough white girls
in this school for you to talk to?

22:20.924 --> 22:26.680
There aren't enough girls in this school
as beautiful as you to talk to.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.186
-Smooth.
-I try.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.481
All right. After the game.

22:43.655 --> 22:46.825
At least without Jace,
they're gonna have no idea what to expect.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.202
I got a private with CJ.

22:50.245 --> 22:52.289
-How'd that happen?
-He asked.

22:52.873 --> 22:56.543
His dad might have put him up to it.
But either way, we're gonna need him.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.922
Hey, Coach. I got debate team now.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.715
All right, go ahead.

23:03.634 --> 23:04.635
Ernesto.

23:07.763 --> 23:11.141
I hate to admit it,
but Emory raises a good question.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.769
I don't see Jace
rolling with a bunch of guys

23:13.852 --> 23:17.940
that he can call whenever he wants
to beat somebody up. What do you think?

23:19.399 --> 23:23.737
If Jace needed help with something,
he's gonna call on his brothers.

23:27.282 --> 23:28.742
We gotta get ahead of this.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.374
Anything you can tell me about the attack?

23:35.457 --> 23:38.210
My son would never be involved
in something like that.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.337
No.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.925
I know
what happened to Crystal is terrible.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.969
But I had nothing to do with the attack.

23:47.052 --> 23:50.639
Whatever went down
Jace kept me in the dark.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.017
Are you serious? No, I wasn't there.

23:54.685 --> 23:56.478
We're friends, teammates.

23:56.562 --> 23:59.231
But none of them would expect me
to come through for them like that.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.315
Not in that way.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.985
What would make you say that?

24:06.196 --> 24:07.447
I tend to avoid conflict.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.867
In this instance,
that's a good thing, Roy.

24:15.581 --> 24:18.542
Drew, you need to tell us right now
if you had anything to do with this.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.753
No. We weren't there with him.

24:24.715 --> 24:27.509
Drew, you just said,
"We weren't there with him."

24:31.263 --> 24:32.264
Right.

24:33.265 --> 24:35.559
So, who exactly is "we"?

24:40.898 --> 24:41.982
Anyone.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.693
Anyone like who, Drew?

24:54.494 --> 24:55.746
Allahu Akbar.

24:57.623 --> 24:59.041
Allahu Akbar.

24:59.708 --> 25:00.709
Ameen.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.419
Ameen.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.885
Bismillah, we need to talk.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.888
Is it about the team?

25:14.264 --> 25:16.308
-Sort of.
-I've been getting a lot less minutes.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.228
It's-- I mean it's starting to feel
like Coach Ike doesn't want me

25:19.311 --> 25:20.687
running the offense anymore.

25:20.771 --> 25:23.774
Just keep working, and keep your focus.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.317
-You'll get the minutes back.
-Yeah.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.195
That's not what we need to discuss.

25:28.904 --> 25:29.988
When you were in LA…

25:32.908 --> 25:34.034
you were depressed.

25:35.661 --> 25:38.789
-You said you wanted a change of scenery.
-Yeah. Yeah, I--

25:38.872 --> 25:40.999
Is that because of the pandemic
or something else?

25:41.583 --> 25:43.126
It was everything, Dad.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.421
Just feeling isolated.

25:47.923 --> 25:49.508
It was Granddad dying.

25:52.970 --> 25:53.804
Anything else?

25:55.430 --> 25:56.807
Is that not enough?

25:56.890 --> 25:59.601
What can you tell me about the night
Crystal's coach was beaten?

26:02.521 --> 26:03.522
No, I don't--

26:03.605 --> 26:06.942
May I remind you
that you just said your prayers.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.980
I'm just-- I'm--

26:50.903 --> 26:51.987
I got you, son.

26:54.323 --> 26:55.324
I got you.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.411
I got you.

27:00.871 --> 27:02.039
Have a seat, son.

27:19.515 --> 27:21.308
It's about the attack on Warrick.

27:21.391 --> 27:24.978
Jace's video said he had three guys
from the neighborhood help.

27:26.146 --> 27:27.147
Okay.

27:27.773 --> 27:28.774
"Okay"?

27:31.026 --> 27:33.153
Phil, we think it's more to it than that.

27:34.071 --> 27:37.074
And I hope you know that everyone in here
is someone that you can trust.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.331
Dad, I'm…

27:47.876 --> 27:50.879
I'm glad you took
your anger management classes.

27:54.508 --> 27:56.510
And thank you for doing that.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.262
Of course.

27:59.346 --> 28:02.558
We have Miss Tonya to thank for that.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.312
And Ma…

28:09.690 --> 28:15.404
since you been out of jail,
I just ain't been the same.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.198
I'm just not.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.034
I'm happy.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.124
And I can't lose you again.

28:30.878 --> 28:35.048
Just tell us what happened, Phil.

28:47.895 --> 28:50.731
Jace said he needed help with something.

28:55.235 --> 28:57.779
He said that someone
was hurting one of his friends.

29:01.450 --> 29:02.951
I didn't even ask why.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.247
Deep down, I don't…

29:09.374 --> 29:12.628
I don't even think I was beating on
that coach to help Jace.

29:17.007 --> 29:18.425
I was just so angry.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.393
You were hitting me.

29:34.566 --> 29:35.692
I'm sorry.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.327
I'm sorry.

29:58.799 --> 29:59.842
Come here.

30:01.260 --> 30:02.511
Come here.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.818
When I think about it,
what Jace did to you--

30:18.819 --> 30:19.820
What he did to me?

30:21.154 --> 30:25.242
Jeopardizing your scholarship offers,
all your future opportunities, everything.

30:25.826 --> 30:27.744
Yeah, way to help, Carson.

30:27.828 --> 30:30.664
-He was trying to be a 24-hour person.
-A who?

30:30.747 --> 30:32.374
Twenty-four-hour person.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.335
It's something our coach told him.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.380
It means, being consistent.

30:39.256 --> 30:42.593
Being the type of person who won't
abandon you in a time of crisis.

30:43.385 --> 30:48.432
A 24-hour person is someone
you can count on 24-hours a day.

30:52.019 --> 30:53.228
That's so stupid.

30:54.438 --> 30:56.273
I know you were kids, but still.

31:11.455 --> 31:12.456
My son…

31:16.919 --> 31:22.799
he tells me,
four years ago he attacked a man…

31:25.135 --> 31:27.471
because Jace desperately needed help.

31:27.554 --> 31:30.724
Never for a minute to stop and think,

31:30.807 --> 31:35.437
what if this man had a gun or a knife?

31:38.524 --> 31:39.900
What if the cops were there?

31:41.401 --> 31:43.070
I just wanna keep my son safe.

31:43.153 --> 31:46.073
There's too many ways
that this could have gone horribly wrong.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.327
That's real.

31:53.288 --> 31:57.584
I spoke with the other families
this morning.

31:57.668 --> 32:01.421
They agreed to stay silent…

32:04.633 --> 32:06.552
until everyone obtained counsel.

32:09.680 --> 32:10.973
Does that work for you?

32:17.479 --> 32:18.313
Yeah.

32:18.397 --> 32:19.398
Okay.

32:20.732 --> 32:21.733
Check this out.

32:37.374 --> 32:38.458
Wow.

32:38.542 --> 32:39.459
Yeah.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.170
Where'd you get these?

32:41.253 --> 32:43.255
Pascale screen-printed 'em
at his dad's shop.

32:44.756 --> 32:46.508
-I handled the letter designs.
-No way.

32:47.843 --> 32:48.760
Yeah.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.514
How'd you get everyone to come out?

32:53.140 --> 32:54.558
Even if he wasn't your boy,

32:54.641 --> 32:56.643
we still can't let the school treat him
like that.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.396
He's done nothing wrong
since he's been here,

32:59.479 --> 33:01.440
and they're really trying to jam him up
off old news?

33:01.523 --> 33:03.192
For defending a sister from a pedo?

33:03.275 --> 33:05.402
-Nah, there's no way we can sit here--
-No, I got it. I got it.

33:05.485 --> 33:06.486
Thank you.

33:11.408 --> 33:13.493
-Jace is a real one.
-Yeah.

33:13.577 --> 33:18.749
So we got tipped off that some students
have something big planned at the game.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.502
Big like what?

33:21.585 --> 33:25.380
Big, as in they wanna put certain athletes
on campus in their place.

33:25.464 --> 33:26.507
But don't worry about it.

33:26.590 --> 33:29.009
Black students from other private schools
are ready to show up and show out.

33:29.092 --> 33:30.260
So we got his back.

33:34.848 --> 33:35.849
Yep, shot.

33:37.392 --> 33:38.227
Let's go!

33:40.854 --> 33:43.565
-That's okay. It's okay.
-Come on, CJ!

33:43.649 --> 33:45.150
Mental toughness.

33:46.485 --> 33:47.653
Can you not?

33:47.736 --> 33:50.072
Excuse me. My bad.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.701
All right. Let's go.

33:56.286 --> 33:57.454
Stay low, stay low.

33:59.957 --> 34:00.916
Yep, eyes.

34:00.999 --> 34:01.875
Slow, slow.

34:06.421 --> 34:07.881
There you go!

34:07.965 --> 34:09.424
That's what I'm talking about.

34:09.925 --> 34:13.804
Next time I wanna see you
make that shot with a hand in your face.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.264
Really?

34:24.606 --> 34:27.025
I don't want to get pulled
into everything that's happening.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.194
My parents are concerned,

34:29.277 --> 34:32.906
and I don't wanna jeopardize
anything college related.

34:34.324 --> 34:39.371
I'm sorry, Jace, but I don't think
we should see each other anymore.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.001
You have nothing to be sorry about.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.129
Thanks for understanding.

34:55.596 --> 34:59.516
The system doesn't get much right,
especially when it comes to our young men.

34:59.600 --> 35:03.937
But the police and the DA understand
there's a greater good to serve here.

35:04.021 --> 35:05.480
They're not gonna charge him?

35:05.564 --> 35:08.567
We're still hashing that out,
but if he cooperates,

35:08.650 --> 35:10.068
I think I can make it go that way.

35:10.736 --> 35:11.987
What do you mean cooperate?

35:12.696 --> 35:15.240
You're going to have to name
whoever else took part in the beating.

35:21.205 --> 35:23.332
This is Jackie. Tell me something good.

35:23.415 --> 35:25.292
At the tone, please record your message.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.252
When you've finished recording
you may hang up

35:27.336 --> 35:29.338
or press one for more options.

35:29.421 --> 35:32.758
Yo, Jack.
I'm trying not to go crazy right now.

35:34.176 --> 35:36.053
Please let me know if we can link up.

35:39.431 --> 35:40.974
And y'all know he deserved it!

35:53.237 --> 35:54.821
Hey. Hey.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.199
Really? A party?

35:58.033 --> 35:59.785
It's just a get-together.

36:01.912 --> 36:05.123
Okay, it's just to unwind, to let it go.

36:49.668 --> 36:50.669
You a freshman?

36:52.004 --> 36:54.339
-Huh?
-I haven't seen you around before.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.260
Yeah. I'm new.

37:00.012 --> 37:01.305
I'll give you some advice.

37:02.014 --> 37:04.892
Everybody comes to college
trying to prove how grown they are,

37:05.809 --> 37:07.519
but you can't have the grown-up
without the kid in you.

38:11.792 --> 38:12.709
Hey, yo.

38:16.421 --> 38:17.506
I love you.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.261
I love you too.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.933
You know you're welcome here anytime
you need to get away.

38:30.686 --> 38:31.687
Thanks.

38:35.023 --> 38:36.567
When this year started,

38:36.650 --> 38:39.236
I challenged myself to see
if I could go a whole year

38:39.319 --> 38:40.821
without saying the word, "can't."

38:41.572 --> 38:42.447
How'd you do?

38:44.366 --> 38:45.576
Lasted about a month.

38:49.413 --> 38:54.668
But then I thought,
adults don't think that way.

38:57.796 --> 38:59.590
They say the word, "can't" all the time.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.634
So I stopped trying.

39:05.387 --> 39:06.388
And right now…

39:10.976 --> 39:14.980
I can't figure out
how to survive all this.

39:20.235 --> 39:22.070
You know what adults couldn't do?

39:23.864 --> 39:25.741
They couldn't protect Crystal.

39:26.992 --> 39:30.704
But the guy who never said "can't" could.

39:32.581 --> 39:33.582
Thank you.

39:37.503 --> 39:38.462
You don't even know.

39:38.545 --> 39:39.546
I know.

39:44.218 --> 39:48.597
Back in effect, Keys to the Kingdom
coming to you live on Instagram,

39:48.680 --> 39:51.850
on YouTube and as always,
posted on SoundCloud.

39:51.934 --> 39:57.022
My name is Drew Murphy,
and I'm here with my cohost, Musa Rahaim.

39:57.898 --> 40:02.611
That's right.
And this is a special broadcast,

40:02.694 --> 40:04.738
so, we're gonna dive straight into it.

40:04.821 --> 40:07.199
Someone asked us to give him some airtime,

40:07.282 --> 40:10.327
and we are more than happy to oblige.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.663
So, please welcome our guest.

40:12.746 --> 40:16.542
The most famous high school senior
in the world right now,

40:17.960 --> 40:21.839
our brother, Cedar Cove's Jace Carson.

40:23.298 --> 40:27.719
I appreciate you two
for putting me on the show.

40:29.930 --> 40:32.307
But I'll say from the jump

40:32.391 --> 40:35.477
that if your listeners came for the drama
and controversy,

40:36.812 --> 40:38.146
they're gonna be disappointed.

40:38.230 --> 40:41.275
I came on tonight to talk about one thing.

40:42.568 --> 40:48.240
Basketball and how much I love this game.

40:50.742 --> 40:52.369
Since I was a kid,

40:52.452 --> 40:56.832
before the love and the hate on social,

40:56.915 --> 40:58.876
before the predictions

41:00.002 --> 41:01.003
and…

41:03.088 --> 41:04.047
all the noise,

41:04.631 --> 41:06.383
I fell in love with this game.

41:08.218 --> 41:10.804
Even then I felt like I could fly.

41:10.888 --> 41:12.389
And when I'm gliding through the air,

41:12.472 --> 41:16.602
it's like pressing mute
on everything else.

41:20.022 --> 41:21.398
I thought I could do anything.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.067
What about you?

41:24.151 --> 41:25.485
What about me, what?

41:28.363 --> 41:30.073
Bring us back to when you were a kid.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.452
When did you fall in love with the game?

41:36.079 --> 41:37.164
It was…

41:44.713 --> 41:45.589
it was in the car.

41:45.672 --> 41:52.429
My Pops, he'd drive me to tournaments
in DC, Baltimore, Virginia.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.475
And we'd listen to music.

41:57.184 --> 41:58.310
Sometimes R & B.

41:58.810 --> 42:00.062
Mostly hip-hop.

42:14.660 --> 42:18.038
It was like basketball was my girlfriend…

42:20.374 --> 42:26.505
who introduced me to her really,
really cute friend named Music.

42:27.798 --> 42:30.259
What's your love story for the game,
young fella?

42:31.844 --> 42:33.262
I came home with a trophy.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.932
MVP of the game.

42:42.229 --> 42:45.566
And then it broke so I started crying.

42:46.817 --> 42:49.403
And then my dad told me something
I never forgot.

42:52.114 --> 42:54.867
He said, "Always remember.

42:56.660 --> 43:00.330
Win or lose.

43:00.414 --> 43:05.002
Drew, you are the trophy."

43:11.884 --> 43:12.926
Thanks, y'all.

43:15.387 --> 43:16.638
I really needed this.

43:21.018 --> 43:22.102
Me too.

43:24.062 --> 43:25.272
Me too.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.946
Y'all my boys, you know that?

43:33.030 --> 43:35.616
Outta here, boy. What's wrong with you?

43:37.868 --> 43:39.077
Ladies and gentlemen.

43:41.496 --> 43:46.335
Thank you all for coming together
at such short notice.

43:47.878 --> 43:53.091
We have not been receiving the type
of notoriety that we are accustomed to,

43:53.175 --> 43:58.263
and our head of school has been inundated
with calls from concerned parents.

43:59.389 --> 44:04.019
We'll first hear from a huge supporter
of Cedar Cove athletics,

44:04.102 --> 44:08.106
head of Community Relations
at Gladiator Sneakers, Alonzo Powers.

44:08.732 --> 44:09.733
Thank you.

44:12.861 --> 44:16.156
At 14 years old,
Jace Carson enrolled at Cedar Cove.

44:16.865 --> 44:21.411
He was enrolled after being recruited
by the former varsity basketball coach

44:21.495 --> 44:23.539
and our current Athletic Director.

44:24.331 --> 44:25.832
Now, before all of that,

44:27.042 --> 44:29.419
he attacked a man
with the help of three others.

44:31.129 --> 44:33.799
Now, did he rob this man? No.

44:34.925 --> 44:36.385
His motives were very simple.

44:37.010 --> 44:39.888
To stop this man
from hurting a young woman--

44:39.972 --> 44:44.518
a girl at the time,
who also had a very promising future.

44:45.978 --> 44:47.271
He did not fail.

44:48.605 --> 44:52.192
The systems put in place
to protect our children have failed.

44:53.569 --> 44:56.321
Right now,
we have an opportunity for a redo.

44:56.405 --> 44:58.740
We couldn't stand with them before,
but we can now.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.201
Today will be the second game

45:01.285 --> 45:05.163
that the team will be suited
in Gladiator sneakers and apparel.

45:05.247 --> 45:08.125
And on behalf of Gladiator,
I would like to say we would be proud

45:08.208 --> 45:10.169
to have Jace Carson suited with them.

45:10.252 --> 45:11.879
So, thank you.

45:12.838 --> 45:13.839
Thank you.

45:14.798 --> 45:16.717
-Thank you, Mr. Powers.
-Of course. Of course.

45:17.342 --> 45:18.552
Thank you, guys, for your time.

45:19.219 --> 45:20.888
-We'll get something worked out.
-Thank you.

45:26.059 --> 45:27.352
What are your thoughts?

45:27.436 --> 45:31.231
To penalize him for something
that occurred long ago does seem unjust.

45:32.316 --> 45:35.569
But I'd imagine
if you polled our families and students,

45:35.652 --> 45:38.780
the vote would be split as to whether
Cedar Cove is better without Mr. Carson.

45:38.864 --> 45:43.160
Now, we can't react to the whims
of all of our families,

45:43.243 --> 45:44.786
but we can't ignore them either.

45:44.870 --> 45:47.206
As head of school, my concern
is that he's become a distraction,

45:47.289 --> 45:50.584
compromising not only the brand
of our athletic programs,

45:50.667 --> 45:53.045
but everything that we, as a school,
stand for.

45:53.837 --> 45:56.965
What he did, regardless of motive,
was illegal.

45:58.509 --> 46:01.678
Excuse me for my blunt question.

46:02.804 --> 46:04.973
Nick Mendez is coming back.

46:05.599 --> 46:10.103
-And CJ is a rising star.
-Thank you.

46:11.271 --> 46:14.107
Can we win without Jace Carson?

46:24.910 --> 46:27.162
Thought we told him
to take it easy on his first game back.

46:27.663 --> 46:28.664
We did.

46:33.126 --> 46:34.711
We gotta figure out what we're gonna do.

46:39.383 --> 46:40.425
Love you.

46:55.941 --> 46:59.319
See? This is the stuff I'm talking about.
This is unacceptable.

47:00.654 --> 47:02.072
We are Jace Carson.

47:02.155 --> 47:03.407
We are!

47:03.490 --> 47:05.659
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:05.742 --> 47:07.160
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:07.244 --> 47:09.121
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:09.204 --> 47:11.081
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:11.164 --> 47:12.916
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:13.000 --> 47:14.751
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:14.835 --> 47:16.378
-Jace Carson!
-We are!

47:16.461 --> 47:17.671
Jace Carson!

47:22.467 --> 47:23.552
Tip violation!

47:23.635 --> 47:24.803
Give me the ball.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.725
Technical foul!

48:01.381 --> 48:04.801
Hey! What the hell is this?

48:04.885 --> 48:07.429
If they can get at Jace
for defending Crystal,

48:07.513 --> 48:09.723
they can get at us for anything, Coach.

48:10.265 --> 48:11.767
If he doesn't play, we don't play.

48:11.850 --> 48:13.310
We are Jace Carson.

48:17.773 --> 48:19.024
Musa.

48:36.458 --> 48:37.459
What's happening?

48:37.960 --> 48:40.629
It's-- Just substitutions.

48:43.757 --> 48:46.260
-Coach. Coach. Are you forfeiting?
-Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

48:46.343 --> 48:48.387
We need five. Or you forfeit.

48:48.470 --> 48:49.721
Johnny. Lewis. Royale.

48:51.765 --> 48:53.475
-Okay.
-Let's go, Johnny.

48:53.976 --> 48:56.353
-Let's go!
-Let's go. Focus. Focus.

49:01.149 --> 49:02.568
-I'm sorry, Coach.
-What the hell?

49:02.651 --> 49:05.195
Coach! Coach!

49:05.946 --> 49:07.114
Eddie! Come on.

49:18.041 --> 49:19.293
Back up. Back up.

49:35.851 --> 49:38.937
Yo, Jarrett. We got the gym now.
Time to go.

49:39.021 --> 49:41.273
Nah, I ain't going anywhere.
Y'all can wait.

49:41.899 --> 49:44.568
Wow. Hey,
you better do what she says, Benny.

49:44.651 --> 49:47.070
Or she'll get one of her hit men
to take you out.

49:49.907 --> 49:52.242
The infamous Crystal Jarrett.

49:56.121 --> 49:58.665
I have to come to the gym
after it's closed for the day

49:58.749 --> 50:00.042
if I wanna work out.

50:00.125 --> 50:02.669
But now these boys are telling me
I can't even have that.

50:04.254 --> 50:06.048
I'm the top 25 recruit,

50:06.590 --> 50:09.009
and you come in here
to kick me out of the gym?

50:09.968 --> 50:12.721
I'm more heralded
than any male athlete at this school,

50:14.223 --> 50:15.807
but I gotta make way for you?

50:18.185 --> 50:20.354
Benny, when y'all practice
on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

50:20.437 --> 50:21.688
where do the girls practice?

50:23.023 --> 50:24.441
We practice outside.

50:25.526 --> 50:28.195
Even during the winter. Why don't you
ask me how I feel about that?

50:29.071 --> 50:30.364
You made a comment.

50:30.447 --> 50:33.617
You said I should get one of my--
what did you call them? My hit men?

50:33.700 --> 50:34.952
That's all you know about me.

50:35.536 --> 50:37.287
I'm the girl who got her coach beat up.

50:38.205 --> 50:40.457
It doesn't matter what the truth is.

50:40.541 --> 50:43.961
It doesn't matter what else I am.

50:44.586 --> 50:46.630
Because you never see us.

50:50.259 --> 50:53.929
No one is ever interested in seeing us
for who we really are.

50:55.472 --> 50:57.516
The little bit you've decided to know
about me

50:58.183 --> 51:00.686
is something that happened four years ago.

51:00.769 --> 51:02.771
Something horrible that stopped

51:02.855 --> 51:05.649
because my best friend stepped up
and did something about it.

51:05.732 --> 51:07.985
Something adults weren't capable of doing.

51:08.068 --> 51:09.444
He protected me.

51:10.821 --> 51:12.698
Because people see what they wanna see,

51:13.282 --> 51:16.493
Jace Carson is being treated
like he did something wrong.

51:17.077 --> 51:20.414
But what's really wrong
is how people try to tear us down

51:21.748 --> 51:22.958
like it's their sport.

51:24.168 --> 51:25.586
But, this is my sport.

51:26.670 --> 51:27.921
This is my life.

51:28.422 --> 51:30.799
This is Jace's sport. This is his life.

51:30.883 --> 51:32.301
And you can't take that away from us.

51:32.384 --> 51:33.969
So, if you want me out of here,

51:35.804 --> 51:37.472
you better be ready to drag me out.

51:37.973 --> 51:39.433
'Cause I ain't going nowhere.

51:44.104 --> 51:45.397
It's not even worth it.

51:47.733 --> 51:48.942
Let's go, boys.

51:50.527 --> 51:52.321
-Did all that.
-For nothing.

52:13.091 --> 52:14.968
Yes, sir, let's go!

52:25.854 --> 52:26.855
Push it!

52:28.065 --> 52:29.900
Throw it to my hand, throw it to my hand.

52:30.484 --> 52:31.944
Come on. Corner, corner, corner.

52:35.197 --> 52:36.406
Yes, sir!

52:36.490 --> 52:39.409
-That's what I'm talking about! CJ Ryder!
-All right, CJ! Come on! Let's go!

52:43.330 --> 52:46.500
Let's go! Let's go, baby!

52:58.971 --> 53:00.055
Take that off.

53:02.975 --> 53:03.976
And that too.

53:12.901 --> 53:14.611
-Huh?
-Defense! Defense!

53:15.988 --> 53:17.739
Come on. What was that?

53:43.223 --> 53:44.224
Excuse me,

53:44.308 --> 53:46.685
do you think there'd be any more protests
like this in future games?

53:48.145 --> 53:50.564
How do you feel
about Jace Carson's suspension?

53:50.647 --> 53:52.191
Do you think he's played
his last game as a Mustang?

53:52.274 --> 53:54.902
Why didn't you play?
Are you protesting Carson's suspension?

54:00.949 --> 54:05.787
I didn't play, 'cause I was there
that night with Jace Carson.

54:10.459 --> 54:11.585
The hell's going on here?

54:11.668 --> 54:15.964
I sat out tonight 'cause I was there
that night with Jace Carson.

54:16.673 --> 54:18.759
-You were there too?
-To what extent?

54:19.384 --> 54:21.678
-Meg. Meg, what the hell is going on?
-I don't know.

54:21.762 --> 54:23.805
-What about you, Royale?
-I--

54:23.889 --> 54:25.557
He wasn't there that night.

54:26.975 --> 54:27.976
But I was.

54:32.397 --> 54:33.732
We stand with our brother.

54:37.027 --> 54:39.947
His punishment is inequitable and unjust.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.449
We are Jace Carson.

54:43.367 --> 54:44.618
-We are!
-Jace Carson!

54:44.701 --> 54:46.662
-Hey! Hey!
-Jace Carson!

54:46.745 --> 54:48.330
-We are!
-Jace Carson!

54:48.413 --> 54:49.915
-We are!
-Jace Carson!

54:49.998 --> 54:52.543
What happens to the team now?
Are you concerned--

54:52.626 --> 54:55.379
-Okay, that's enough. You can step back.
-That's enough.

54:55.462 --> 54:57.214
-We are!
-Jace Carson!

55:13.605 --> 55:15.315
-Say it louder!
-Jace Carson!
