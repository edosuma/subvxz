{\an1}bit,

06:10.703 --> 06:11.871
{\an1}dancing up on like random

06:11.954 --> 06:13.956
{\an1}objects, like a cabinet.

06:14.040 --> 06:14.540
{\an1}Everybody's just looking at me

06:14.624 --> 06:16.417
{\an1}like I'm a complete idiot.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.960
{\an1}But I think I'm the coolest

06:18.044 --> 06:19.462
{\an1}person in the room.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.881
{\an1}And then we see two huge dudes

06:21.964 --> 06:23.466
{\an1}start walking our way.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.510
{\an1}And they did not look happy.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.470
{\an1}Like "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

06:27.553 --> 06:29.097
{\an1}you guys need to go."

06:29.180 --> 06:30.932

06:33.267 --> 06:34.352
{\an1}"The girls can stay."

06:34.435 --> 06:34.894
{\an1}She said, "Fine, just like

{\an1}"give us a few minutes,

06:36.687 --> 06:37.980
{\an1}and we'll head out."

06:38.064 --> 06:39.440
{\an1}So they turn their back.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.942
{\an1}And then she looks over at me,

06:41.025 --> 06:41.859
{\an1}and she said,

06:41.943 --> 06:44.153
{\an1}"This is your first party ever.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.863
{\an1}"We are not leaving without a

06:45.947 --> 06:46.864

06:46.948 --> 06:47.865
{\an1}We look over,

06:47.949 --> 06:50.493
{\an1}and there's this red gnome thing

06:50.576 --> 06:52.411
{\an1}sitting on one of their shelves.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.329
{\an1}She's like, "We're talking it,

06:53.412 --> 06:54.330
{\an1}"and you're gonna put it under

06:54.413 --> 06:55.957
{\an1}your shirt, and we're leaving."

06:56.040 --> 06:57.416
{\an1}But then they start yelling,

06:57.500 --> 06:58.501
{\an1}"The gnome is missing.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.669
{\an1}"And we're shutting the whole

06:59.752 --> 07:01.671
{\an1}"entire house down until we find

07:01.754 --> 07:02.380
{\an1}the gnome."

07:02.463 --> 07:04.048
{\an1}And it turns out that that gnome

07:04.132 --> 07:06.384
{\an1}was like their mascot basically,

07:06.467 --> 07:08.177
{\an1}and we had just stolen their

07:08.261 --> 07:09.595
{\an1}prized possession.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.429
{\an1}We were like, "[bleep],

07:10.513 --> 07:11.681
{\an1}what do we do with this gnome?"

07:11.764 --> 07:13.141
{\an1}They were basically going to

07:13.224 --> 07:14.350
{\an1}like eat me as a snack.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.017
{\an1}"Guys,

07:15.101 --> 07:15.977
{\an1}"let's come up with a game plan.

07:16.060 --> 07:16.561
{\an1}What are our exit routes?"

07:16.644 --> 07:18.521
{\an1}Because they had locked down

07:18.604 --> 07:19.564
{\an1}every single door in the house.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.774
{\an1}Ashley says, "Okay,

07:21.858 --> 07:23.818
{\an1}"you guys are gonna go run

07:23.901 --> 07:25.027
{\an1}"through the backdoor,

07:25.111 --> 07:26.070
{\an1}"and I'm going to go up to this

07:26.154 --> 07:27.446
{\an1}"guy, and I'm just gonna

07:27.530 --> 07:28.614
{\an1}flirt with him."

07:28.698 --> 07:29.407
{\an1}Break.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.783
{\an1}Ashley completely has him

07:30.867 --> 07:31.909
{\an1}distracted.

07:31.993 --> 07:32.869
{\an1}"Oh, wow,

07:32.952 --> 07:34.829
{\an1}you have such big arms."

07:34.912 --> 07:36.372
{\an1}And you can see him like

07:36.455 --> 07:37.039
{\an1}breaking.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
{\an1}Then she'll look over to us

07:38.207 --> 07:38.708
{\an1}slightly and give us a wink.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.751
{\an1}So my heart is racing,

07:40.835 --> 07:41.794
{\an1}because the moment of

07:41.878 --> 07:42.628
{\an1}opportunity is here.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.629
{\an1}We just run.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.256
{\an1}I grab Ashley by the arm.

07:45.339 --> 07:46.799
{\an1}We run out through the backdoor.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.843
{\an1}Ashley's laughing hysterically.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.261
{\an1}I'm hyperventilating with the

07:50.344 --> 07:51.929

07:52.013 --> 07:53.181
{\an1}It's insanity.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.224
{\an1}We take a look back,

07:55.308 --> 07:56.392
{\an1}and the guys are running towards

07:56.475 --> 07:57.393
{\an1}us.

07:57.476 --> 07:58.436
{\an1}And Ashley kind of gives them a

07:58.519 --> 08:00.229
{\an1}slight wave like, "That's right,

08:00.313 --> 08:01.314

08:01.397 --> 08:02.773
{\an1}So the next morning,

08:02.857 --> 08:05.443
{\an1}we wake up to this huge thud

08:05.526 --> 08:06.861
{\an1}knocking on the door.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.488
{\an1}It's the two frat guys.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.323
{\an1}[bleep].

08:10.406 --> 08:12.033
{\an1}And I slowly open the door.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.242
{\an1}"Hey, like do you guys

08:27.757 --> 08:28.841
{\an1}And I slammed the door right in

08:28.925 --> 08:30.134
{\an1}their face.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.093
{\an1}And guess what?

09:37.743 --> 09:38.160

09:38.244 --> 09:38.703
{\an1}through this gate.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.038

17:21.415 --> 17:22.624
{\an1}So our last night there,

17:22.708 --> 17:24.626
{\an1}we wanted to do something...a

17:24.710 --> 17:25.335
{\an1}little bit different.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.337
{\an1}So we walk outside, and we see,

17:27.421 --> 17:28.255
{\an1}to my left,

17:28.338 --> 17:30.591
{\an1}a line of just dark cars with

17:30.674 --> 17:31.925
{\an1}guys standing outside.

17:32.009 --> 17:32.718
{\an1}One of them comes running over

17:32.801 --> 17:33.552
{\an1}to us.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.678
{\an1}And he says, "Hey, my friends,

17:34.762 --> 17:35.554
{\an1}do you need a ride?"

17:35.637 --> 17:36.555
{\an1}And I say to John, "What?

17:36.638 --> 17:37.848
{\an1}Is this going to be okay?"

17:37.931 --> 17:38.640
{\an1}And he says, "Yeah, yeah,

17:38.724 --> 17:39.558
{\an1}it's gonna be fine."

17:39.641 --> 17:40.934
{\an1}And he doesn't know anything.

17:41.018 --> 17:41.477
{\an1}And he says, "Okay, vaminos,

17:41.560 --> 17:42.853
{\an1}amigos."

17:42.936 --> 17:43.479
{\an1}You can't say no to "vaminos,

17:43.562 --> 17:46.356
{\an1}amigo" when you're in Mexico.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.024
{\an1}It's like a magic spell.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.776
{\an1}And so we get in the car with

17:48.859 --> 17:49.485
{\an1}him.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.194
{\an1}And he says, "Okay,

17:50.277 --> 17:50.611
{\an1}where do you go?"

17:50.694 --> 17:51.195
{\an1}We don't have anywhere to go,

17:51.278 --> 17:53.197
{\an1}so I just tell him,

17:53.280 --> 17:55.157
{\an1}"Take us somewhere fun."

17:55.240 --> 17:55.532
{\an1}Just hit the gas,

17:55.616 --> 17:57.451
{\an1}and started driving into the

17:57.534 --> 17:58.952
{\an1}darkness of Mexico.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.120
{\an1}I ask him at one point, "Hey,

18:00.204 --> 18:01.413
{\an1}where are we going?"

18:01.497 --> 18:02.331
{\an1}And he said, "Si, si, vaminos,

18:02.414 --> 18:03.165
{\an1}amigo."

18:03.248 --> 18:04.875
{\an1}And again, we were like, "Okay,

18:04.958 --> 18:05.876
{\an1}great."

18:05.959 --> 18:06.668
{\an1}Well, we're gonna follow because

18:06.752 --> 18:08.504
{\an1}he said the cool Spanish words

18:08.587 --> 18:09.338
{\an1}again.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.798
{\an1}And we start driving into this

18:10.881 --> 18:13.425
{\an1}really rundown small town.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.134
{\an1}There's no cars,

18:14.218 --> 18:15.302
{\an1}there's no people.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.011
{\an1}There's stray dogs everywhere.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.846
{\an1}And he starts walking through

18:17.930 --> 18:18.847
{\an1}this alleyway.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.724
{\an1}He turns to face the brick wall.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.725
{\an1}He knocks on the one of the

18:21.809 --> 18:24.937
{\an1}boards, and it swings open.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.563
{\an1}And standing in the doorway is

18:26.647 --> 18:29.233
{\an1}just the biggest man I've ever

18:29.316 --> 18:30.400
{\an1}seen in my life.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.903
{\an1}He had more muscles on his face

18:32.986 --> 18:34.988
{\an1}than I do on like my whole body.

18:35.072 --> 18:35.989
{\an1}It was like his eyebrows had

18:36.073 --> 18:36.824
{\an1}biceps.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.283
{\an1}And there were six packs on his

18:38.367 --> 18:39.368
{\an1}cheeks.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.202
{\an1}As soon as John and I are

18:40.285 --> 18:42.287
{\an1}inside, he steps out,

18:42.371 --> 18:43.288
{\an1}closes the door,

18:43.372 --> 18:45.624
{\an1}locks it behind him.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.334
{\an1}I get more scared than I've ever

18:47.417 --> 18:48.919
{\an1}been in my entire life.

18:49.002 --> 18:49.878
{\an1}And I'm thinking to myself,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.255
{\an1}"I don't wanna stay in Mexico.

18:51.338 --> 18:51.839
{\an1}"I don't wanna lose my liver

18:51.922 --> 18:52.965
{\an1}"tonight.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.299
{\an1}I don't wanna lose my spleen."

18:54.383 --> 18:55.008
{\an1}Five minutes later,

18:55.092 --> 18:56.009
{\an1}we hear a knock on the door.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.554
{\an1}And in walks this girl in blue

18:58.637 --> 19:01.306
{\an1}lingerie with a uni-brow.

19:01.390 --> 19:01.723
{\an1}And she says, "Hola,

19:01.807 --> 19:03.392
{\an1}me llamo Christina."

19:03.475 --> 19:05.394
{\an1}And she kisses us on the cheek,

19:05.477 --> 19:06.562
{\an1}and then she walks out.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.898
{\an1}And we realize, "Oh my God,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.233
{\an1}it's a brothel."

19:11.316 --> 19:12.484
{\an1}Like 50 girls that just walk in

19:12.568 --> 19:13.777
{\an1}and out, in and out, in and out.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.946
{\an1}"Hola, me llamo Vanessa."

19:16.029 --> 19:16.697
{\an1}[in deep voice] "Hola,

19:16.780 --> 19:17.114
{\an1}me llamo Francesca."

19:17.197 --> 19:20.450
{\an1}"Hola, me llamo Rebecca."

19:20.534 --> 19:21.827
{\an1}And John looks over at me,

19:21.910 --> 19:22.786
{\an1}and he's smiling.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.246
{\an1}He's got both eyebrows up.

19:24.329 --> 19:24.746
{\an1}And l look back at him,

19:24.830 --> 19:26.123
{\an1}I start shaking my head no.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.667
{\an1}Finally, the big,

19:28.750 --> 19:30.544
{\an1}gigantic guy comes back inside.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.169
{\an1}And he hands us a menu and says,

19:31.253 --> 19:33.797
{\an1}"Okay, now you pay

19:33.881 --> 19:34.965
{\an1}or you don't leave."

19:35.048 --> 19:35.883
{\an1}And I say, "Hey, man,

19:35.966 --> 19:36.800
{\an1}"I need to go to my hotel

19:36.884 --> 19:37.759
{\an1}to get cash."

19:37.843 --> 19:38.135
{\an1}And he says, "No,

19:38.218 --> 19:41.555
{\an1}we have American ATM in lobby."

19:41.638 --> 19:42.347
{\an1}And I was like, "Oh,

19:42.431 --> 19:43.557
{\an1}he thought of everything."

19:43.640 --> 19:45.392
{\an1}So he puts his gigantic hands on

19:45.475 --> 19:45.726
{\an1}our shoulders,

19:45.809 --> 19:47.644
{\an1}and he walks us out of the room.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.270
{\an1}And I see my reflection in his

19:48.353 --> 19:50.272
{\an1}machete.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.648
{\an1}And I look up at John.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.900
{\an1}And John looks at me.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.693
{\an1}And we take off out the door

19:54.776 --> 19:55.277
{\an1}full sprint back to the car.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.404
{\an1}We're running faster than we've

19:57.487 --> 19:58.989
{\an1}ever ran in our lives.

19:59.072 --> 19:59.865
{\an1}Big, muscular guy,

19:59.948 --> 20:01.742
{\an1}he's yelling at us in Spanish.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.077
{\an1}"Americanos, no!"

20:04.161 --> 20:06.038
{\an1}We got back, and we're sweating.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.456
{\an1}But we yell at him, "Go, go, go,

20:07.539 --> 20:08.457
{\an1}go!"

20:08.540 --> 20:09.541
{\an1}And he takes off.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.334
{\an1}And he turns around to look at

20:10.417 --> 20:11.001
{\an1}us.

20:11.084 --> 20:11.460
{\an1}And he says, "Okay,

20:11.543 --> 20:12.920
{\an1}"I know where to take you guys

20:13.003 --> 20:13.879
{\an1}"next.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.297
{\an1}Vaminos, amigos."
