00:01.640 --> 00:03.160
'Previously, on St Elsewhere.'

00:03.160 --> 00:05.040
Jack, your wife has had an accident.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.280
Accident?

00:06.280 --> 00:08.000
Nina's dead, Jack.
What?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.480
I'll do anything to keep living just
as long as I can.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.920
I've only got two options.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.560
I can let her die,
or I can do a heart transplant.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.320
Ladies and gentlemen, I've just
received a call from Porter General.
We have a heart.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.400
All right!

00:20.400 --> 00:22.560
'Tonight, on St Elsewhere.'

00:22.560 --> 00:25.560
I am performing this heart
transplant in 30 minutes.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.400
I'll expect 12 pints of A- blood
in the OR when I get there!

00:29.400 --> 00:31.160
We're going to be rich.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.080
I'm going to go
and call my broker right now.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.920
And how are you guys making
all this money?

00:34.920 --> 00:35.800
Silver futures.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.120
Silver futures.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.960
We've got it all figured out. It's a
one day trade. We can't miss.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.960
Since you've arrived, you've
given us nothing but ultimatums,
and it makes things very difficult.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.240
Big shot, saving people's lives.
I couldn't even save my own wife.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.000
Jack, it was not your fault.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.560
It was a stupid accident!

00:50.560 --> 00:52.280
Mike, I don't want to die.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.640
I won't let you die.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.280
ALARM

00:54.280 --> 00:55.800
ALARM

00:55.800 --> 00:59.800
Ehrlich, begin cardiac massage.
I don't want to lose her. Hurry!

02:52.480 --> 02:54.320
15 pints in the entire hospital?

02:54.320 --> 02:55.640
How the hell did we get so low?

02:55.640 --> 02:58.120
Our supply is still down
from summer. We haven't had...

02:58.120 --> 03:00.960
You're in charge of the blood bank.
Why wasn't it built back up?

03:00.960 --> 03:02.680
It takes time.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.240
Besides, our levels are practically
the lowest in the city.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.920
It's always been that way.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.760
That's no excuse. I need six pints
just to prime the bypass machine.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.800
I know that.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.560
What if she haemorrhages?
What about post-op complications?

03:13.560 --> 03:14.680
I'm trying to tell you...

03:14.680 --> 03:16.480
No, I'm telling you.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.400
Now, I am performing this heart
transplant in 30 minutes.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.400
I'll expect 12 pints of A- blood
in the OR when I get there.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.360
(TANNOY) 'Dr Mark Craig...'

03:25.360 --> 03:29.360
Oh, for the love of...

03:30.360 --> 03:33.320
Craig. What is it?

03:33.320 --> 03:37.320
Absolutely not! I'm in OR 2.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.720
I know the lighting is better in 2.
That's why I'm using it!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.960
He's doing a double hernia,
for crying out loud.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.680
He ought to be able to do
that in the dark!

03:44.680 --> 03:48.680
You tell Hoffman he uses 1,
or nothing.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.160
Ah, Dr Craig.

03:58.160 --> 03:58.880
Ah, Dr Craig.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.680
Ah, Dr Craig.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.240
I'm aware of that.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.840
Mrs Leighton has been prepped
and moved to pre-op.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.600
Try telling me something I don't
know, like what about the blood?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.280
The blood, sir?

04:10.280 --> 04:11.760
There's a shortage of A-.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.400
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of that.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.440
Ehrlich, I picked you for this job
because I thought you could handle
it.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.240
Making sure there's an adequate
supply of blood for the operation

04:19.240 --> 04:20.279
is a part of that job.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.200
I'm not assisting you,
you're assisting me!

04:22.200 --> 04:23.240
Yes, sir. I want to.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.320
Well, then, do it!

04:24.320 --> 04:25.640
Right.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.240
California mentality.
No sense of responsibility.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.160
Donald.
Yes, Mark, what is it?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.400
We're down to 15 pints of A-.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.600
I have no intention of going
in that OR and run short.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.640
I have no intention of going
in that OR and run short.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.800
I'm going to make sure you get
everything you need.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.000
Any other problems?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.040
Nothing out of the ordinary
for this scraphold.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.080
Has the transport team left
Porter General yet?

04:43.080 --> 04:46.480
The cardiectomy should be
done in a few minutes,
and then they'll leave in ten.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.560
Excellent. Everything's timing out
perfectly. Good thing, too.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.200
This way I don't have a chance
to get too keyed up.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.240
See you later.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.240
Good luck.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.760
Excuse me.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.680
Hello?

05:12.680 --> 05:15.040
I'm here for Nina Morrison.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.440
To identify her.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.440
I'm her husband.

05:23.240 --> 05:27.240
She was brought in earlier
this morning.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.000
She's gone to the OR.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.520
What?

05:31.520 --> 05:32.560
That's what it says.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.280
That's what it says.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.600
You'd better speak with Dr Byerly.
Just a minute.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.920
No, wait a minute.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.920
Dr Byerly?

05:47.520 --> 05:48.240
Mr Morrison.

05:48.240 --> 05:48.960
Mr Morrison.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.000
Mr Morrison.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.040
Where's my wife?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
When I admitted her this
morning, there was...

05:53.040 --> 05:55.360
Is she alive?

05:55.360 --> 05:56.520
Well, no.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.560
Then what the hell is
she doing in the OR?

05:59.560 --> 06:03.560
Well, I'm sure you're aware your wife
designated herself as an organ donor.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.480
I want to see her chart.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.960
Well, it won't make
much sense to you.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.520
Mr Morrison, your wife's injuries
were quite extensive.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.000
Did she respond any
deep-pain stimuli?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.080
No.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.720
Then why isn't it charted?

06:18.720 --> 06:19.440
It is.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.080
It is.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.720
I know, I'm a doctor.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.360
Then you're aware those things
aren't always written down...

06:27.360 --> 06:29.520
Did she respond any stimulus or not?

06:29.520 --> 06:30.640
No.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.560
Are you sure you didn't miss
anything?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.840
I'm positive.
There was decorticate posturing.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.480
Did you get a CAT scan?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.680
It wasn't necessary.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.480
You were supposed to  save  her life!

06:41.480 --> 06:44.320
Your wife was in deep shock
when they brought her in.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.160
She'd lost over four units of blood,
had no BP and a heart rate of 40.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.560
Now, we didn't even have a chance
to get her stabilised

06:50.560 --> 06:51.680
before she flat-lined.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.680
The EEG failed to show any
wave patterns.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.480
There was nothing more
anyone could do.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.480
I'm sorry.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.720
# TOWER OF POWER:
Down To The Nightclub

07:43.720 --> 07:46.320
# Righteous and ready and pretty
Down to the nightclub

07:46.320 --> 07:48.840
# Down to the nightclub

07:48.840 --> 07:51.280
# Bumpty-bumpty bump. #

07:51.280 --> 07:52.800
What do you mean, free money?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.400
I'm telling you, silver
is in for a long-overdue correction,

07:55.400 --> 07:56.800
and we're talking big bucks.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.520
Yeah, what makes you so sure?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.800
You follow the charts
and you pick your timing right,

08:00.800 --> 08:01.960
it's practically a lark.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.480
There's no such thing.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.240
I know this guy who got heavy
into bean futures, or something.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.200
Even mortgaged his house against
this big deal he said couldn't miss.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.320
Now he lives with his wife and kids
in a three-room flat on Comm Avenue.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.240
Things like that can happen,
but only if you're a stupid player.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.760
You have to pick your spots,
like a good running back.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.800
I'm in on a day train.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.360
That means by four o'clock,
I'm out, profit in hand.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.840
What do you figure you'll make?

08:22.840 --> 08:23.880
Three or four.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.000
Hundred?

08:25.000 --> 08:25.720
Sterns.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.800
Sterns.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.760
There something I can do for you?

08:29.760 --> 08:30.800
Oh, no, sorry.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.360
Explain how this works again,
from the beginning.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.000
OK, Sterns.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.640
And slowly.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.120
You know, sometimes,
you're a real dim lightbulb.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.159
&lt; Now, let's say you have
a few thousand put aside

08:41.159 --> 08:43.200
and you want to invest,
maybe in precious metal.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.360
Right.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.240
You've got two choices,
options or futures

08:47.240 --> 08:51.240
Me, I'd choose options. They're less
risky. You have a limited...

09:00.720 --> 09:01.760
How do I look?

09:01.760 --> 09:03.600
Beautiful. How are you feeling?

09:03.600 --> 09:05.920
Shaking.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.360
Everything's going to be fine,
I promise.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.920
You sound pretty confident

09:09.920 --> 09:12.440
for someone who's never
done this before.

09:12.440 --> 09:16.440
I am.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.080
You know,
I remember lying here a year ago,

09:20.080 --> 09:22.240
just before you did my bypass.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.520
You kept baiting me about school
desegregation.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.640
Picked a heck of a time
to start an argument.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.880
We weren't arguing,
we were debating.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.440
I remember you became rather
adamant about your position.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.160
And rather loud, too.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.760
But you finally agreed with me.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.760
It was the only way
I could get you into the OR.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.080
I'm afraid I'm not going to come
through the operation.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.440
I'll never wake up again.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.120
Mark, I don't want to die.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.120
I won't let you die.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.040
Look, Mr Czeski, I have
nothing against hot dogs. &gt;

10:21.040 --> 10:22.080
In fact, I love them, &gt;

10:22.080 --> 10:23.600
but you can't wheel your cart
through the Emergency Room. &gt;

10:23.600 --> 10:25.400
but you can't wheel your cart
through the Emergency Room. &gt;

10:25.400 --> 10:27.360
Just leave this here.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.680
No, my cart travels with me.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.880
&lt; Fiscus, we've got to talk!

10:29.880 --> 10:30.920
Luther, I'm busy.

10:30.920 --> 10:31.640
Luther, I'm busy.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.880
Luther, I'm busy.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.280
You need any help?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.840
Yeah, I need help. A couple of young
punks, they tried to rob me.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.600
They cut my arm bad, and this boy's
just standing around arguing!

10:40.600 --> 10:42.120
No, Mr Czeski, I was not arguing.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.240
Are you calling me a liar?

10:43.240 --> 10:44.280
No, I didn't. Shut up!

10:44.280 --> 10:45.480
Don't you tell me to shut up!

10:45.480 --> 10:47.040
Hold it, now! Hold it, now.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.680
Mr Czeski, I will take care of your
arm for you. Come with me.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.800
Yeah, what about my cart?

10:50.800 --> 10:54.800
Jenny, will you come and watch this
man's cart? Mr Czeski, come with me.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.880
What?!

10:56.880 --> 10:58.040
Fiscus, we've got to talk.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.680
This better be important, Luther.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.680
It is. Listen to this.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.880
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

11:23.840 --> 11:27.480
Ladies and gentlemen, we've all
worked hard to get here.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.800
Waiting on call for a donor
for the past two weeks

11:29.800 --> 11:32.280
wasn't simply an exercise
in patience.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.920
This is it.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.080
It's going down.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.760
We have an opportunity to extend
this woman's life,

11:37.760 --> 11:41.720
and by God,
we're going to make sure we do it.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.960
I want this operation to be flawless.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.560
We're a team,
we're to function as a team.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.640
Now, each one of us has a job to do.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.440
If, at some point, you don't feel up
to the challenge,

11:51.440 --> 11:53.680
drop back, let someone else step in.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.680
This is a long
and gruelling operation.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.680
I believe we have the skill
and dedication to make it work.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.400
Now let's prove it.
Dr Morgan, may I come in?

12:05.400 --> 12:08.040
Yes, doctor.
Patient is stable.

12:08.040 --> 12:12.040
Scalpel.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.600
Sternum saw.

12:29.640 --> 12:33.640
REPORTERS CHATTER

12:34.560 --> 12:36.120
Excuse me.
Who are all these people?

12:36.120 --> 12:37.720
Reporters covering the transplant.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.360
I wonder if there's one
from The Globe?

12:39.360 --> 12:40.960
I want to complain about my
paperboy.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.680
I want to complain about my
paperboy.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.680
I want to complain about my
paperboy.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.880
Hello, Louise.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.880
How are you feeling?

12:50.880 --> 12:53.480
Now Dr Gavin's filled
you in on the procedures,

12:53.480 --> 12:55.720
is there anything you'd like to
talk to me about?  No.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.400
Are you sure?

12:57.400 --> 12:58.480
Are you sure?

12:58.480 --> 13:01.640
They just put me under,
cut my breast off and stitch me up.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.960
I just don't believe it.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.920
I'm only 29 years old.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.440
This isn't supposed to be
happening to me.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.000
I told this one guy
that I go out with

13:09.000 --> 13:11.800
that I was losing a breast
to cancer.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.760
You should have seen his face.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.240
How did I complain then?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.960
I know it's hard from where you
are now to think you'll ever adjust,

13:21.960 --> 13:23.520
but it gets easy.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.720
Or maybe it was easy for you.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.120
You know, you're already married,
you have a family.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.280
Helps, but...

13:30.280 --> 13:32.960
you'd be surprised how much support
you'll find out there.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.960
But, even so, don't you
worry about the cancer coming back?

13:37.240 --> 13:39.520
Sure.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.480
You can't stand still.

13:42.480 --> 13:46.120
Louise, I know it's hard to believe,
but life goes on.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.120
Oh, well, guess I'll have
to consider the alternative.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.040
And, after a while, you'll see there
are options available.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.840
You know, Dr Gavin talked to me
about having reconstructive surgery.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.640
Did you find that it helped you?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.520
I haven't had it done.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.880
Why not?

14:04.880 --> 14:07.480
I don't know.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.520
Then what are we talking about here?

14:09.520 --> 14:11.160
Options and alternatives?

14:11.160 --> 14:13.680
What right do you have to give me
all this motherly advice

14:13.680 --> 14:16.040
when you haven't done
anything about it yourself?

14:16.040 --> 14:20.040
Just get out of here.
Go away, please.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.880
I don't know, Luther.
It sounds risky.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.040
Risky?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.960
Silver prices have
been down for a week now.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.640
As soon as they announce
the money supply and numbers,

14:36.640 --> 14:39.000
that'll be the knockout punch.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.440
We stand to make 5,000 big ones.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.760
You heard what the man said.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.440
What makes him the expert?

14:45.440 --> 14:47.640
The man was betting
800 in his trades.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.320
I mean,
I'd take those odds any time.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.520
Then I say do it.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.560
All right!

14:51.560 --> 14:53.480
But not with my money.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.760
What?

14:54.760 --> 14:58.280
Pass. You want a hot dog?

14:58.280 --> 15:02.240
You know, you don't know what it's
like, growing up where I did.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.480
Being black and short.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.640
I mean, my future doesn't look all
that bright.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.640
You know, Fiscus, you and I
are from two different worlds.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.080
You've gotten all the right breaks.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.080
I mean, plenty of money,
nice home, good schools.

15:20.080 --> 15:24.080
Remember taking the College Boards
and thinking, "Where should I go"?

15:24.240 --> 15:27.600
"Yale? Princeton? Harvard?"

15:27.600 --> 15:29.880
I never even got a chance
to take them.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.840
The only boards I was knocking down

15:31.840 --> 15:35.680
was the ones at the
unemployment office.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.360
You see, you got a bright future
ahead of you.

15:39.360 --> 15:43.120
You got nowhere to go but up,
you being a doctor, and all.

15:43.120 --> 15:47.120
And someday, someday, you're going
to make 80 grand for telling people,

15:47.280 --> 15:51.280
"Take two aspirins
and call me in the morning."

15:51.560 --> 15:55.560
But me? Well, I won't
get me the chances.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.960
Nope.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.960
And you can bet, when opportunity
comes knocking around my door,

16:04.760 --> 16:08.760
I'm going to open up and let it in.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.680
I put up 80%, right?

16:14.680 --> 16:16.880
¤3,600. I'll do the other 20%.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.480
And we're out by the end of the day?

16:18.480 --> 16:22.480
Absolutely.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.840
You got a deal.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.600
You won't be sorry, Fiscus.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.520
We're going to be rich.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.520
I'm going to go call my broker,
right now.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.400
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

16:48.320 --> 16:50.280
Now, here, the procedure
differs slightly

16:50.280 --> 16:52.320
from Lower and Shumway's description.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.640
Isn't that right, Dr Ehrlich?

16:53.640 --> 16:56.120
Yes, sir, that's right.
I know it well.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.840
Then you might as well talk us
through it

16:57.840 --> 16:59.960
for those who are not so familiar.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.760
The procedure?

17:02.760 --> 17:05.480
OK, erm, unlike Lower and Shumway's
technique of orthotopic

17:05.480 --> 17:09.119
transplantation, Dr Craig will be
leaving the posterior walls

17:09.119 --> 17:12.119
of the right and left atria in place
with their Venus connections.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.240
Make sure the ascending aorta
stays in place.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.359
I've got it.

17:15.359 --> 17:18.359
Er, then Dr Craig will suture
the corresponding structures

17:18.359 --> 17:19.920
of the residual atria.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.640
Cut.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.640
And finally, Dr Craig will
anastomose the great vessels,

17:26.440 --> 17:30.440
end-to-end anastomosis of the aorta
of the pulmonary artery.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.240
Don't do that here, please.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.400
Use the stairwell,
like everyone else.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.520
Dr Westphall?

17:49.520 --> 17:53.080
The conference room's full of
reporters waiting for bulletins on
the transplant,

17:53.080 --> 17:56.040
so the mayor thought this
would be the obvious time

17:56.040 --> 17:58.600
to announce the success
of our health service's task force.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.200
He thinks it's a success, does he?

18:01.200 --> 18:03.920
Well, of course.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.880
We're doing the first heart
transplant in St Eligius' history,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.520
while still managing to
significantly reduce expenditures.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.760
Now, look.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.160
You and I both know that that's
a lop-sided way of looking

18:13.160 --> 18:15.760
at what's been happening here
since the mayor appointed you.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.680
The detrimental effects far outweigh
the positive, and I'm tired of it.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.160
I'd appreciate you delivering the
hourly bulletins to the reporters.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.320
There'll also be a press conference
right after the surgery.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.280
You, Dr Auschlander
and Dr Craig should be there.

18:28.280 --> 18:32.280
You, Dr Auschlander
and Dr Craig should be there.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.680
Helen.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.480
I'm going to need continuous updates
on the transplant

18:39.480 --> 18:40.920
for the news people downstairs.

18:40.920 --> 18:41.960
Lucky you(!)

18:41.960 --> 18:43.200
Yeah.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.520
Jack, what are you doing here?

18:44.520 --> 18:45.760
I want to talk about my schedule.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.480
I want to talk about my schedule.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.200
I want to talk about my schedule.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.040
I want to keep working.

18:50.040 --> 18:54.040
Come on, let's go into my office.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.040
Jack, I really think you ought to
consider taking some time off.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.440
I don't want to.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.440
I just want to change my schedule.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.360
I just want to change my schedule.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.600
I just want to change my schedule.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.600
I'm sorry, I don't want
to stop working.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.680
I can't go home.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.480
I can't face the fact that
Nina is not going to be there.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.920
Believe me, this is the last place
I thought I'd want to be,

19:20.920 --> 19:23.520
but I've got no place else to go.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.040
Now, look, Jack.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.200
I'm not asking you to leave,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.600
but you've been going through
a hell of a lot,

19:29.600 --> 19:31.680
and until you've had some time
to deal with that,

19:31.680 --> 19:33.600
I can't allow you to
go on treating patients.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.600
I'm sorry.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.920
Nurse Rosenthal.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.000
Hello, Claire.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.480
I got here as fast as I could.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.440
How is my sister? Is she all right?

19:54.440 --> 19:56.720
Eve's fine. They took her to
surgery two hours ago.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.240
I just spoke to her on the phone
a little while ago.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.920
She didn't say anything about it.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.680
No, I'm sure she didn't know then.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.360
I haven't even reached my husband
yet. Do you know how much longer
she'll be?

20:06.360 --> 20:08.400
Quite a while. Why don't you go
and get some rest?

20:08.400 --> 20:09.880
Oh, no, no. I have to stay.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.000
I'm sure Dr Craig will find you when
it's over.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.400
Why don't you wait down the hall?

20:13.400 --> 20:17.400
Right.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.960
Well, he was told
he'd have 30 days to file an appeal.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.760
It's been a month and a half.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.040
No, you tell him to call me
directly.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.240
Right.

20:26.240 --> 20:30.240
See you in 20 minutes. Bye.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.040
No fun being the heavy.

20:36.040 --> 20:40.040
Don't start.
I'm not in the mood.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.320
You in the mood for lunch?

20:41.320 --> 20:45.320
I can't. I've got too much to do
with this press conference.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.320
Could you put that thing out?
It stinks.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.280
Sorry.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.560
I thought this was my office.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.560
You know smoking drives me crazy,
and you still keep puffing away.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.880
It's one of the most filthy...

20:56.880 --> 20:58.760
Stop, already, will you?
I put it out.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.080
Well, you should quit.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.200
I've tried.

21:02.200 --> 21:06.200
Maybe you haven't tried hard enough.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.640
See you tonight?

21:11.640 --> 21:13.960
Yeah. I'll make dinner.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.520
Good.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.520
Your moustache smells
and you taste terrible, too.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.880
DOOR BANGS

22:11.880 --> 22:13.200
I should have been there.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.040
Jack.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.600
If I'd been there,
none of this would have happened.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.720
But you weren't.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.600
Yeah, because I was here!

22:21.600 --> 22:25.440
Like every other morning.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.880
While she was feeding Peter,
getting ready to go to the sitter's

22:28.880 --> 22:32.440
so she could go to work, I was here.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.640
And for what?

22:34.640 --> 22:35.960
So I can be a big hotshot?

22:35.960 --> 22:38.840
Big hotshot, save people's lives.
I couldn't even save my own wife.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.840
Jack, it was not your fault.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.560
She fell in the bathroom
and hit her head.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.280
It was a stupid accident.

22:50.280 --> 22:54.280
If I'd been there to help,
it would not have happened!

22:54.800 --> 22:57.080
She wouldn't have been
running around,

22:57.080 --> 23:01.080
doing everything herself,
because I could have helped.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
I should have been there.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.240
God.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.400
I'm sorry.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
It's going to be all right.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.120
Immediate post-op care is similar to
that of other major cardiac surgery.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.160
George.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.880
Body temperature's 86.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.880
Good. I'll defibrillate at 20 watts
per second.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.440
Sometimes the heart begins
a regular rhythm of its own.

23:48.440 --> 23:51.080
Possibly, you'll get a tachycardia,
but in most cases,

23:51.080 --> 23:52.720
you'll have to defibrillate.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.040
MACHINE BEEPS

23:54.040 --> 23:55.280
Ready.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.600
Clear.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.040
MACHINE SHOCKS

23:58.040 --> 23:59.520
Start an IV of isopro, 1 to 1,000.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.520
This will stimulate the heart
and improve cardiac output.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.120
We'll also initiate
immunosuppressive therapy.

24:06.120 --> 24:06.760
MACHINE BUZZES

24:06.760 --> 24:07.640
MACHINE BUZZES

24:07.640 --> 24:08.680
MACHINE BUZZES

24:08.680 --> 24:12.680
Give me 20 watts per second, stat.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.320
Ready.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.440
Clear.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.840
Begin cardiac massage.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.400
Give me a shot of epinephrine, stat.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.080
Start the isopro drip, 1 to 1,000.

24:20.080 --> 24:24.080
I don't want to lose her, damn it.
Hurry!

24:28.400 --> 24:32.400
Defibrillate again,
20 watts per second.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.760
MACHINE BEEPS

24:34.760 --> 24:35.800
Ready, Doctor.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.080
Clear.

24:38.080 --> 24:42.080
Blood pressure 120/80, heart rate 74
and regular, ventilation adequate.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.600
All right. While bringing the body
back to normal temperature,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.360
we need to check
for residual bleeding,

24:48.360 --> 24:52.360
especially from the aorta,
and get her off the pump.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.720
Vijay, what's bothering you?

24:57.720 --> 24:59.600
I'm all right, thanks.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.800
Are you still upset because Craig
didn't pick you

25:01.800 --> 25:03.120
for the support team?

25:03.120 --> 25:05.680
Yeah, a tad.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.400
Come on, don't let it bother you.

25:07.400 --> 25:11.400
You know, he didn't invite me
for the party,

25:11.600 --> 25:15.600
and he never calls on me for his
lectures, and now this.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.600
You think it means something?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.920
He's forgotten your name.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.880
Hey, hey, hey!
Am I in time?

25:23.880 --> 25:25.080
Be our guest, Luther.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.320
Did you buy it?

25:26.320 --> 25:30.080
We've owned a 5,000 oz silver future
for almost three hours now.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.480
And?

25:31.480 --> 25:32.600
How are we doing?

25:32.600 --> 25:34.800
Don't know, I'm waiting
to hear the financial news.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.960
When did the MX figures come out?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.000
When did the MX figures come out?

25:37.000 --> 25:40.040
Might as well be MX, it's going to
rocket us to another tax bracket.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.680
And how are you guys going to
make all this money?

25:42.680 --> 25:45.440
Silver futures. We bought the right
to sell silver at a certain...

25:45.440 --> 25:46.960
Silver futures. We bought the right
to sell silver at a certain...

25:46.960 --> 25:49.640
'..while the beans and bellies,
having broken their declining tops.'

25:49.640 --> 25:52.240
'..while the beans and bellies,
having broken their declining tops.'

25:52.240 --> 25:52.960
Sssh!

25:52.960 --> 25:54.640
Sssh!

25:54.640 --> 25:57.240
'opened sharply lower this
morning in moderate trading.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.960
'Due to higher interest rates,
many traders are selling short,

25:59.960 --> 26:02.320
'anticipating higher money
supply figures

26:02.320 --> 26:03.880
'throughout late this afternoon.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.120
'Gold is currently down 560,
while silver,

26:07.120 --> 26:10.760
'with a limit at ¤1 today,
is down 52 cents.'

26:10.760 --> 26:13.240
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.200
As soon as the prices drop, we sell.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.280
Run to the bank.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.240
Yeah, we talk about megabucks!

26:18.240 --> 26:22.240
You know, I heard someplace that 80%
of all commodity trades go south.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.280
Who asked you?

26:30.360 --> 26:34.280
Excuse me.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.160
How's your work
going at the breast clinic?

26:36.160 --> 26:39.160
Well, I like the preventive clinic
and the group sessions are fine,

26:39.160 --> 26:40.720
but one-to-one is rough.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.960
A patient on my floor,
Louise Garrison,

26:42.960 --> 26:45.480
she's due for a mastectomy tomorrow,
young girl.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.640
I'm worried about her.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.800
I tried telling her
about reconstruction, but...

26:48.800 --> 26:50.120
Want me to have a talk with her?

26:50.120 --> 26:52.320
Yeah, maybe, in a few days.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.200
What do you normally say
to your patients?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.440
That I think it can be wonderful.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.520
Never a dissatisfied customer.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.720
Sure, that happens, but the majority
of women who undergo

27:01.720 --> 27:04.280
the procedure have their lives
changed for the better.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.320
Really?

27:05.320 --> 27:07.400
The techniques that are
developed are amazing.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.360
It's not just a mound of silicone.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.520
We can rebuild a whole new
breast with a nipple

27:11.520 --> 27:14.320
that looks and feels
just like a natural breast.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.480
Maybe to you.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.440
Well, couldn't be
worse than my prosthesis.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.160
Feels like a bra full of wet sand.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.680
Maybe you ought to consider
an implant for yourself.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.840
My husband's all for it,
if that's what I want.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.360
What do you want?

27:27.360 --> 27:28.960
I don't know.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.640
But I'll think about it.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.600
I'd better be going,
or I'll be late for the clinic.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.600
Thanks.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.680
You got a minute?
I've got to talk to you.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.480
Sure, but I'm parked in a
no-smoking,

27:45.480 --> 27:46.680
so can you walk and talk?

27:46.680 --> 27:50.680
Yeah, sure.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.280
You keep a pretty close
eye on the stock market, don't you?

27:55.280 --> 27:56.400
I always see you reading

27:56.400 --> 27:58.400
the business section of the
newspaper, right?

27:58.400 --> 28:01.200
Well, I'm really a millionaire,
Fiscus. I just do this for a hobby.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.240
No, seriously.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.960
You see, I'm thinking of trading my
silver future for an option.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.280
What are you talking about?

28:06.280 --> 28:10.160
Luther Hawkins and I got in on
a 5,000 oz silver contract.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.680
You're crazy!

28:11.680 --> 28:14.440
We've got it all figured out. It's a
one-day trade. We can't miss!

28:14.440 --> 28:16.480
Listen, take a little
piece of friendly advice.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.040
Don't do what you don't know.
Go call your broker and get out.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.840
Bobby, clearly, you don't
understand...

28:20.840 --> 28:22.800
No, clearly I do understand.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.120
A few years back, I made this...

28:26.120 --> 28:28.680
Forget it.
It's none of my business, OK?

28:28.680 --> 28:30.480
Wait a minute, finish the story.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.280
No, I shouldn't have said anything.
Do you know what you're doing?

28:33.280 --> 28:35.240
Well, I mean,
we're colleagues, sort of,

28:35.240 --> 28:37.720
and I want to hear what
you have to say.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.240
All right.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.760
A few years ago,
I did this commodities deal.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.440
I had it all worked out,
figured I'd make a bundle, you know,

28:44.440 --> 28:47.280
move down to San Diego,
open up a small private practice.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.200
Figured I couldn't lose.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.200
I got killed by a margin call,
and lost 20 grand.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.800
Yeah, but...

29:00.800 --> 29:04.800
Early detection, leading
to diagnosis and treatment &gt;

29:04.880 --> 29:08.440
is your best hope for the
control of breast cancer. &gt;

29:08.440 --> 29:12.440
I can't stress enough the importance
of at-home self-examination.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.360
Almost 90% of all breast
cancer symptoms are discovered

29:17.440 --> 29:20.560
in this way, and if you catch it in
its early stages, you have a chance

29:20.560 --> 29:24.560
to save breast tissue, and possibly
eliminate the cancer entirely.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.520
Had I been conducting my own exam
on a regular basis, once a month,

29:29.520 --> 29:33.520
for just a few minutes, I probably
wouldn't have had to lose my breast.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.560
And I'm a nurse.
I should have known better.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.520
Take the time to do it.

29:41.520 --> 29:45.520
If it's a chore,
ask your lover to help.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.680
Now we're going to watch a tape
from the American Cancer Society

29:48.680 --> 29:51.600
on self-examination,
and afterwards we can talk about it.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.600
Could you get the lights?

30:05.320 --> 30:07.440
Luther, where have you been?

30:07.440 --> 30:10.000
I've been leaving messages for you
all over the place.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.880
I've been out, adding to my wardrobe.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.880
Who says you can't buy off the rack?

30:13.880 --> 30:16.160
Luther, I called Weinstock
at the commodity house,

30:16.160 --> 30:17.240
and I sold our contract.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.280
What?

30:18.280 --> 30:19.320
Talking to Caldwell...

30:19.320 --> 30:20.680
Talking to Caldwell...

30:20.680 --> 30:23.960
What does he know about anything?
He ain't even hardly a real doctor!

30:23.960 --> 30:26.440
We were way in over our heads,
and I saved us a lot of money.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.960
I can't believe this is happening.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.080
You're nuts, you know that?
You're crazy.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.440
Just when the goose was about to
lay the golden egg,

30:32.440 --> 30:34.160
you had to go and cook it!

30:34.160 --> 30:36.440
Man, you're crazy!
Real crazy!

30:36.440 --> 30:37.960
I can't believe it!

30:37.960 --> 30:41.360
You call yourself a doctor? Oh!

30:41.360 --> 30:45.360
Oh!

30:45.480 --> 30:47.840
I want to thank you all.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.800
You've managed to perform
beyond what I anticipated.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.120
You all deserve to be congratulated.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.400
George, what have you got?

30:54.400 --> 30:57.720
BP steady, 110/65.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.040
Arterial blood gas is normal.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.080
Excellent.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.680
Dr Craig, next to tissue
rejection by the host, what's

31:02.680 --> 31:06.480
the biggest problem to be overcome
in respect of heart transplants?

31:06.480 --> 31:10.480
The public's ignorance, and their
reluctance to participate as a donor.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.800
From what I can see,
the tissue is more cooperative.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.760
How many of you here remember
receiving your donor consent forms,

31:18.760 --> 31:21.880
the ones that were sent out
along with your driver's licence?

31:21.880 --> 31:25.280
Did you bother to sign them
and send them back?

31:25.280 --> 31:26.720
Suction.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.920
Dr Morgan, how's she doing?

31:27.920 --> 31:29.840
Everything looks normal.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.360
It's going to be a smooth landing.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.800
If you didn't sign them,

31:32.800 --> 31:35.520
and you die, you might as well
leave your body to the vultures.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.600
You either look at organ
donation as preserving the dead

31:38.600 --> 31:40.480
or perpetuating the living.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.920
I believe that life
should be passed on.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.440
What's the history of this donor?

31:44.440 --> 31:48.440
Dr Morgan, read the history, please.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.640
Cause of death, severe head trauma,

31:51.640 --> 31:54.400
resulting in massive brain
haemorrhage.

31:54.400 --> 31:58.400
Admitted Porter General ER 9:17am,
time of death, 9:30am.

31:58.960 --> 32:02.760
Donor white female,
weight 125 lbs, age 28,

32:02.760 --> 32:06.760
name, Morrison, Nina L.

32:17.480 --> 32:21.480
Cut.

32:33.160 --> 32:37.160
Jack.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.880
I'm sorry about Nina.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.240
You know,
if there's anything I can do...

32:42.240 --> 32:44.560
Yeah.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.560
Yeah... Could you
look on a Mr Cagino in 438?

32:49.480 --> 32:51.560
Sure.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.480
You know where Ehrlich is?

32:53.480 --> 32:54.520
He's down in surgery.

32:54.520 --> 32:58.520
They found a donor this
morning for the heart transplant.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.880
Jack, please.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.280
All right, all right, all right.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.320
Come on, take it easy.

33:04.320 --> 33:08.320
Come on, take it easy.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.920
I want to get her to
the ICU as soon as possible.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.840
Let me know immediately if there's
any change in the status.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.040
Yes, sir.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.040
I'll be in Dr Westphall's office.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.840
Mrs Leighton did very well.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.920
The chances are good.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
If it's any comfort, your wife has
given that woman a second chance.

33:55.600 --> 33:59.600
She's a living example of Nina's
compassion for others.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
I'm sorry.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.680
KNOCK AT DOOR

35:10.680 --> 35:12.880
Congratulations.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.840
I hear Eve Leighton's
doing very well.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.880
Word travels fast.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.880
Yeah, it's my hourly updates.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.040
You should have seen her heart.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.520
Practically fell apart in my hands.

35:32.520 --> 35:36.520
The extent of ventricular
necrosis was...

35:37.080 --> 35:39.720
It's a wonder she lived this long.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.440
Let's be thankful she did.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.040
BUZZER

35:45.040 --> 35:46.360
Yes?

35:46.360 --> 35:47.480
Yes, he is.

35:47.480 --> 35:51.040
OK, thank you.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.800
The reporters are becoming
impatient.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.560
Donald, I know you've been at it
all day with these guys,

35:55.560 --> 35:57.520
but would you do me a favour
and pinch it again?

35:57.520 --> 36:01.040
Everything OK?

36:01.040 --> 36:04.600
Well, I still have to get Eve to ICU,
and rounds.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.400
I just don't feel up to it.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.120
I understand.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.720
You know,
I waited a long time for this day,

36:11.720 --> 36:15.720
and it's hardly the way
I thought it would be.

36:15.920 --> 36:19.920
Sort of feel like a kid
the day after Christmas.

36:23.880 --> 36:27.880
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.400
Night, Betty.
See you tomorrow.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.760
Excuse me?

36:46.760 --> 36:48.680
What? What do you want?

36:48.680 --> 36:51.080
My cousin had a heart
transplant today.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.520
I was wondering if I could see her.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.480
You'll have to check
with the nurse at ICU.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.800
Visitation's restricted.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.600
But your cousin Claire's
in the third floor waiting room.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.120
Erm. Do you know how Eve is?

37:01.120 --> 37:03.000
I understand she's doing well.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.160
That's good news.

37:04.160 --> 37:08.160
Mm-hmm.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.560
What are you doing standing out
here in the cold?

37:21.560 --> 37:22.720
Just killing time.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.360
Can't you find someplace warmer?

37:24.360 --> 37:25.920
Well, actually, I'm out here

37:25.920 --> 37:28.360
for what's supposed to be my last
cigarette.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.760
I've decided to quit smoking.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.480
Well, if you stand out here much
longer,

37:31.480 --> 37:34.320
it very well  could  be
your last cigarette.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.720
Thought about what we said at lunch?

37:36.720 --> 37:40.720
Yeah, a little. But I still don't
think I want more surgery.

37:41.200 --> 37:45.200
I guess you're the only one who's
been able to make a decision today.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.360
You'll know when you're ready.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.560
I hope so. Good night.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.560
Night, Helen.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.000
We'd like to check in.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.320
Something with a hot tub and women.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.600
Yes, your best accommodation.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.480
Luther, about me bailing out.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.520
Luther, about me bailing out.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.400
I thought we were going to
get killed.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.520
I thought we were going to
get killed.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.280
I screwed it up.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.720
Everything that you said was going
to happen happened.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.880
You're not mad?

38:14.880 --> 38:17.880
Me? I feel like singing and dancing.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.600
Well, we could go to my place
and spin some discs.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.600
No, thanks, Vijay. I don't think
we're in the same kind of funk.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.840
No, thanks, Vijay. I don't think
we're in the same kind of funk.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.600
Because we finally got ourselves
a piece of the pie.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.800
I got hold of Weinstock
and bought another contract

38:29.800 --> 38:30.880
before the market went down.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.200
before the market went down.

38:32.200 --> 38:36.200
My man Vijay here came aboard
and saved the day.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.520
We did it!

38:37.520 --> 38:39.600
Not quite as big as the two of you
might have been.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.240
But big enough.
See you later, Fiscus.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.400
Ciao.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.840
Yeah, ciao.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.880
You ever seen a stretch Caddy, Vijay?

38:48.880 --> 38:52.880
No, I'm not into golf.
But I'm willing to learn.

38:54.880 --> 38:57.640
Are you sure you want to go through
with this press conference?

38:57.640 --> 39:00.760
I never miss the opportunity
to be quilted.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.560
That's good. You can do all the
talking. I hate these things.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.840
Dr Westphall, Dr Auschlander.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.240
Where's Dr Craig?

39:07.240 --> 39:09.760
Mark asked to be excused.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.760
The reporters want to talk to the
surgeon who performed the operation.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.480
I would hope people would be more
interested in the patient

39:15.480 --> 39:16.560
than the doctor.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.720
They probably are, but they want to
hear about it from the doctor.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.120
Six hours in the OR can be
very exhausting,

39:23.120 --> 39:25.560
and I know that
if Mark felt up to it, he'd be here.

39:25.560 --> 39:28.080
You don't think
I care about St Eligius, do you?

39:28.080 --> 39:29.760
I never said that.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.120
You're convinced that all
I want is to get my way,

39:32.120 --> 39:33.280
no matter what the cost.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.600
Well, it seems like it.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.320
Since you've arrived, you've
given us nothing but ultimatums,

39:37.320 --> 39:40.160
and it makes things very difficult.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.080
Joan, what Dr Westphall is
saying is, so far,

39:44.080 --> 39:47.640
our work together's hardly been what
you'd call a collaborative effort.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.320
Now, you've got a job to do,
so do we,

39:50.320 --> 39:54.240
so why not put, instead of bang
our heads together,

39:54.240 --> 39:58.160
while seeking
what's best for all concerned?

39:58.160 --> 40:01.440
We're going out to dinner later.
Would you like to join us?

40:01.440 --> 40:05.440
I'm sorry, I have other plans.
Maybe another time?

40:07.600 --> 40:11.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
Drs Auschlander and Westphall.

40:12.560 --> 40:15.320
You know something, Dr Craig?

40:15.320 --> 40:16.720
What, Ehrlich?

40:16.720 --> 40:18.960
I really admire you.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.040
Thank you, Ehrlich.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.960
That's the truth, I mean it.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.920
Well, it's taken a lot of hard work.

40:23.920 --> 40:27.160
I've committed my life to be
the best surgeon possible.

40:27.160 --> 40:31.160
Never stop reaching, and that's
the best advice I can give you.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.560
Her heart rate is up.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.960
What's the blood pressure?

40:43.960 --> 40:45.880
There's a lot of
Pleur-evac drainage.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.880
As soon as we get to the ICU, I want
to administer protamine sulfate

40:50.120 --> 40:53.280
to counteract the heparin
she got in the OR.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.400
OK, here we go.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.040
Doctor, the BP's 80/50.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.800
She may be bleeding.
Open the IV.

41:01.800 --> 41:05.120
We'll start dopamine in the ICU.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.360
Get this guy out. Hey.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.280
Will you get that guy out,
for Pete's sake?

41:09.280 --> 41:13.280
Call security!

41:22.120 --> 41:25.320
She had some bleeding,
but we've got it under control.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.920
Everything's going to be fine.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.600
She's a strong woman.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.320
Can I stay with her
a little while longer?

41:31.320 --> 41:33.280
Well, just for a few minutes.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.240
Then I suggest you get some rest.
It's been a long day.

41:36.240 --> 41:40.240
Thank you.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.640
You know, you can't hold me like
this. I know my rights.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.400
I appreciate you getting up here
so fast.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.560
Is this going to take long?

41:49.560 --> 41:51.520
You could have cost that woman
her life!

41:51.520 --> 41:54.600
Oh, come on. I just wanted
a couple of pictures.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.720
I freelance.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.840
This stuff rings in pretty
good change, you know.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.320
You guys are incredible.

41:59.320 --> 42:00.600
You're slugs, leeches.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.120
You make a living exposing
other people's pain,

42:03.120 --> 42:05.320
invading their privacy.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.160
What? Hey, are you crazy?
Give me that!

42:08.160 --> 42:11.520
Who do you think you are,
coming up here like this?

42:11.520 --> 42:13.520
Do you realise what that
woman's been through?

42:13.520 --> 42:14.560
A cold could kill her.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.400
You can't do that!

42:15.400 --> 42:19.400
You can't do that!

44:11.200 --> 44:15.200
HEART BEATS

44:49.240 --> 44:56.000
