WEBVTT

01:11.112 --> 01:12.822
I kept a journal for a while.

01:15.992 --> 01:18.787
A chronicle of everything
that happened in your absence.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.000
But slowly, the words began to fade.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.214
Sometime after you left,

01:29.297 --> 01:33.718
all the books in the library
became bound volumes of blank paper.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.679
The next day, the whole library was gone.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.016
I never found it again.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.479
And yet you remained while others fled,

01:45.855 --> 01:48.525
the royal librarian
of an abandoned kingdom.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.402
I never felt abandoned.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.489
I knew you would return.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.435
You need rest, my Lord.

03:07.186 --> 03:10.189
And food and perhaps a bit more rest,

03:10.273 --> 03:12.358
and then you'll be back at full strength.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.610
No.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.280
Not without my tools.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.406
Your tools?

03:18.489 --> 03:22.702
My sand, my helm, my ruby.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.287
Why? What happened to them?

03:24.370 --> 03:25.580
They were taken from me.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.374
By my captors.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.710
And then taken from them.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.670
I know not where.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.968
Nor what I am without them.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.018
Darling. How are you?

03:50.063 --> 03:54.442
Well, you'll never guess
what I am looking at.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.819
It is a Caravaggio.

03:57.528 --> 04:01.574
And it can be
your Caravaggio for 22 million.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.246
Well, of course you can
think about it, but not for too long.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.250
Giovanni, it's Josiane.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.963
I hate to bother you at work,

04:15.755 --> 04:18.508
but I've just acquired
another of the Vasari volumes.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.053
Yes, very nice.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.556
Please tell the chairman
that Madame Daudet called.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.559
Yes, I'll hold.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.067
Bernard, I found it.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.488
And it's in exceptional condition.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.283
The Honjo Masamune.

04:50.873 --> 04:55.003
-Hello? Hello?

05:35.376 --> 05:37.628
Quite the place
you got here, Ethel.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.716
Who are you?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.055
How did you get in?

05:48.973 --> 05:52.894
Getting in was the easy part.
The hard part was finding you.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.771
You've done a very good job

05:54.854 --> 05:57.315
of convincing people
Ethel Cripps doesn't exist.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.405
Apparently not good enough.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.700
Well, I'm not exactly "people".

06:11.954 --> 06:13.164
What are you then?

06:13.748 --> 06:19.003
Do you remember the being Roderick Burgess
kept caged in his basement?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.214
Hmm?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.507
King of Dreams?

06:22.590 --> 06:23.716
You're one of his?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.512
I'm my own man now.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.848
With your help, I intend to stay that way.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.683
Why do you need my help?

06:34.268 --> 06:37.188
Because he's out of his cage
and he's coming for us.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.065
You and me.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.568
Why me? I never did anything to him.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.362
Oh, you did though, Ethel.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.115
You stole from him.

06:53.579 --> 06:57.291
There is only one sure way
for me to find my tools.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.878
I must summon the Three-In-One.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.923
Surely it hasn't come to that.

07:04.006 --> 07:09.262
The Fates see past,
present and future, and they know all.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.431
Yes, but they speak in riddles.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.976
They never tell you what you want to know,

07:16.185 --> 07:18.020
only things you should never know.

07:19.897 --> 07:25.027
Perhaps just this once you could ask
one of your siblings for help.

07:26.362 --> 07:30.408
Destiny would certainly know
where your tools are, or Desire…

07:30.491 --> 07:34.036
My siblings have their own realms
to attend to, I have mine.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.457
We do not interfere
in each other's affairs.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.252
You may not,
but they've certainly been known to.

07:42.003 --> 07:46.215
Perhaps just this once
you could tell them what happened to you.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.428
I am quite sure
they know what happened to me.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.558
And not one of them came to my aid.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.192
The Fates aren't cheap, you know.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.403
They cost a bloody fortune.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.826
And at present, I cannot muster
power enough to summon them,

08:13.910 --> 08:15.870
let alone pay that cost.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.331
Unless…

08:18.915 --> 08:21.918
Is there anything of mine
that remains in The Dreaming?

08:23.753 --> 08:26.047
Something that I created?

08:27.715 --> 08:29.050
You created all of this.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.970
No, something that remains intact.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.351
That might retain
some fragment of my power within it.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.603
Something I can absorb.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.105
There is one thing.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.881
Gregory,
come down from there right now.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.300
You're gonna slip and hurt yourself!

09:13.886 --> 09:15.012
That's it.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.557
There he is.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.356
-Are you sure?

09:27.942 --> 09:30.528
Good boy, Gregory. Good gargoyle.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.072
Cain, come quick.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.325
Blasted, bulbous, bilge-bubbling bollocks.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.327
-Cain.
-What you want, powder-brain?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.080
-Can you not see I'm busy?
-We have visitors.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.207
What?

09:45.084 --> 09:45.918
Where?

09:46.961 --> 09:47.795
Cain.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.380
Abel.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.011
Lord Morpheus.

09:55.970 --> 09:56.804
You've come back.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.264
At last.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.932
I told you he'd return.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.225
I never doubted it.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.477
Come in, my Lord.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.231
And you, Lucienne.
To the House of Mystery.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.859
Or to the House of Secrets. I have tea.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.152
I have tea and biscuits.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.322
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
this is not a social call.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.781
What's happened?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.575
-Is something wrong?
-What is it?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.411
For the sake of The Dreaming,

10:20.494 --> 10:23.164
I must take back a gift
I gave you long ago.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.499
Yes, my Lord.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.876
What's ours is yours.

10:26.959 --> 10:27.960
Anything at all.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.879
Just ask it.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.604
Surely there's another way.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.897
I wish there were.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.901
But The Dreaming must be restored.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.236
You say that as if
we're the ones that destroyed it.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.156
As if we disappeared for over a century.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.617
-Cain.
-You forget yourself, Cain.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.118
No, my Lord, you forgot us.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.372
Do you have any idea
what we've already lost

11:04.455 --> 11:06.666
waiting for you to come back
after all these years?

11:06.749 --> 11:07.917
What you have lost?

11:09.251 --> 11:10.378
The answer is no.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.340
I have not come here to ask you.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.551
I've come to ask Gregory.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.386
I need your help.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.767
Gregory, stop. No.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.771
Take me instead. Or Abel.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.274
-Yeah, take me, Lord Morpheus, please.
-I cannot.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.527
I can only reabsorb
that which I have created,

12:16.610 --> 12:18.487
and Gregory began as a Nightmare.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.906
Yes,
but he's one of us now.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.825
It's not fair.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.328
No… it's not.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.348
You're a very good boy.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.376
You don't have to do this, you know.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.470
It's not fair.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.531
You have served
this kingdom with great honor.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.868
You will be missed.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.425
Come, Lucienne.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.344
We have work to do.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.397
Good luck, my Lord.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.484
Simpering suck-up.

15:09.700 --> 15:14.204
I see you've turned your talent
for theft into a successful career.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.042
I don't steal them. I broker them.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.338
Well, you ever keep anything for yourself?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.089
No.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.884
Not even Dream's tools?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.303
Well, he's gonna want them.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.805
And I'm guessing that you do too.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.599
The tools, they won't work for me.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.018
They're made of the same stuff I am.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.772
So… why are you here?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.025
To see if we can help each other.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.028
I could show you how to use them.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.865
Use them to do what?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.785
Make him go away. For good this time.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.789
You want me to kill the King of Dreams?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.459
Right. You can do it. I know you can.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.129
You just have to listen and trust me.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.966
Then I'm afraid we're both dead,

16:07.675 --> 16:10.552
because I don't have them.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.262
Yeah, well, that is too bad.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.974
I wonder if your son knows where they are.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.102
How is John doing these days?

16:19.103 --> 16:23.315
What do you think Dream will do
to the son of Roderick Burgess?

16:25.317 --> 16:28.445
So I'll ask you one more time
for your son's sake.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.241
Where are the tools, Ethel?

16:43.252 --> 16:47.047
Do you think you're
quite ready for this, Your Majesty?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.759
It has been some time
since you've navigated these waters.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.304
Do you think I've forgotten how?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.391
No, but…

16:58.350 --> 17:03.313
I cannot ask The Fates for help
without giving them something in return.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.734
There is nothing left
to give from The Dreaming.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.363
I have to gather my offerings
from the dreams of others.

17:11.947 --> 17:12.948
I understand.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.201
It's just that, in your absence,

17:16.285 --> 17:20.873
these waters have become darker,
treacherous, unsafe.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.511
These waters are as much
a part of me as I am of them.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.016
Gregory's sacrifice will not be in vain.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.251
You were right, Lucienne.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.880
The Dreams and Nightmares
no longer seem to recognize their master.

18:11.048 --> 18:15.260
I will remind them
and take from them what I require.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.934
Since one meets The Fates at a crossroads,

18:22.017 --> 18:25.020
I find one in the dreams
of a Cambodian farmer.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.948
The hanged man represents surrender
and sacrifice for the greater good.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.535
The gallows come from
a young Japanese cinephile,

18:39.618 --> 18:42.121
her head full of British horror films.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.247
Release!

18:45.040 --> 18:48.544
The currents are stronger
and faster than I remember.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.796
I have to focus.

18:52.506 --> 18:57.511
Open my eyes
and see what The Fates require.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.891
-A serpent…

19:02.975 --> 19:04.434
…a symbol of transformation,

19:06.478 --> 19:10.274
of life, death and rebirth.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.194
I have gathered my offerings.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.364
Now, it is up to The Fates.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.622
I, Lord Morpheus,

19:25.706 --> 19:28.125
Dream of The Endless,

19:30.961 --> 19:32.087
summon The Fates…

19:34.548 --> 19:36.383
…the Three-Who-Are-One,

19:37.759 --> 19:39.845
the One-Who-Is-Three.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.389
The Hecate.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.397
Morpheus, it's been a while.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.569
You look thin, love.
Are you eating? Are you hungry?

19:55.652 --> 19:57.738
He is, but not for food.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.616
Look at him. He wants something.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.326
You've found me out.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.621
I do want something.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.332
I need your help.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.416
Help?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.710
Oh, listen to him.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.297
Like you helped us against Circe?

20:15.380 --> 20:17.799
Circe is old business, sister-self.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.676
And he did bring nice stuff.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.614
You may ask us three questions.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.254
And get one answer from each of us.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.838
Thank you, ladies.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.049
My first question.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.302
I had a leather pouch filled with sand.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.096
Where is it?

21:07.933 --> 21:10.978
It was sold in London.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.899
Last purchased by a magic user called…

21:18.735 --> 21:20.445
Johanna Constantine.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.699
Constantine…

21:24.616 --> 21:28.620
I knew a Constantine,
but that was 300 years ago.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.708
You said "last purchased."
Does she still have the sand?

21:32.791 --> 21:35.877
Dream, you know better than that.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.548
You get one question, one answer.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.383
My apologies.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.510
My second question.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.886
Go on, dear.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.515
My helm. What happened to it?

21:53.979 --> 21:55.981
It was traded away
to a demon,

21:58.525 --> 22:00.694
for the Amulet of Protection.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.238
To which demon was it traded?

22:03.864 --> 22:06.408
One question, one answer, love.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.784
Last question.

22:09.286 --> 22:13.081
My ruby, who holds it now?

22:15.292 --> 22:18.879
Your gem was passed
from a mother to a son.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.590
Where are they now?

22:21.673 --> 22:25.093
You have
asked your questions!

22:37.647 --> 22:41.068
My Lord, you didn't give it to The Fates.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.113
Because it was not meant for them.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.398
You don't listen, do you?

23:21.066 --> 23:24.611
Attractive men seldom do.
I suppose they don't have to.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.073
Ethel, are you flirting with me?

23:28.156 --> 23:31.868
You asked me where the tools are,
I told you I don't have them.

23:31.952 --> 23:36.164
I find that difficult to believe,
given your extraordinary success.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.000
Do you think that
the only way a woman can be successful

23:39.084 --> 23:40.460
is by using magic?

23:41.044 --> 23:43.463
Supernatural and sexist.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.757
You really are a Nightmare, aren't you?

23:45.841 --> 23:49.886
Oh, come on, you can't deny
the tools have helped you.

23:51.054 --> 23:54.808
They've certainly kept you
from looking your age.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.601
Now who's flirting?

24:03.066 --> 24:08.196
When I left Roderick, I traded the sand
and the helm for my life in America.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.782
And the ruby?

24:10.866 --> 24:11.867
The ruby…

24:13.243 --> 24:17.581
As you know, it does have the power
to make dreams come true,

24:17.664 --> 24:20.500
but it also makes nightmares come true.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.880
My son, John, took the ruby from me

24:26.006 --> 24:28.008
and then the ruby took John.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.511
Hmm. Well, where is it now?

24:33.054 --> 24:35.432
I don't know. Don't want to know.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.726
You're lying, Ethel.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.524
You don't have to lie.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.775
In fact…

24:49.279 --> 24:50.864
you don't have to say a word.

24:53.116 --> 24:59.206
Your eyes will tell me everything,
every thought, every feeling.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.835
You will regret this. I promise you.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.796
What makes you think that?

25:07.422 --> 25:09.716
I don't need Dream's tools.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.345
I have my own.

25:32.906 --> 25:33.823
Brother.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.538
Thanks for burying me
in such a shallow grave this time.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.583
And… for this.

25:47.545 --> 25:48.838
Who gave you an egg?

25:48.922 --> 25:49.923
You did.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.051
I didn't give you an egg.
Why would I give you an egg?

25:53.134 --> 25:54.761
As an apology for murdering me.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.390
When have I ever apologized
for murdering you?

26:06.273 --> 26:07.732
Cain, look!

26:10.568 --> 26:11.987
It's a baby gargoyle.

26:13.571 --> 26:17.075
If he thinks leaving this creature
on my doorstep makes up for Gregory…

26:17.742 --> 26:19.869
Do you think he came from Lord Morpheus?

26:19.953 --> 26:21.371
Who else, lackwit?

26:21.454 --> 26:23.790
He's trying to buy us off
with a baby gargoyle.

26:24.749 --> 26:29.129
Or he feels just as bad
about losing Gregory as we do.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.759
He's rather cute, isn't he?

26:36.344 --> 26:40.223
I think I'll call him… Irving.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.559
Irving?

26:43.351 --> 26:46.688
You can't name a gargoyle "Irving,"
you gully-guts.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.315
I like Irving.

26:53.570 --> 26:58.074
Gargoyle names…
always begin with a G.

27:00.327 --> 27:04.873
"Gormogon, Gladstone, Ganymede…"

27:05.540 --> 27:07.834
All right, then. Girving.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.464
-Girving?
-It starts with a G.

27:14.174 --> 27:17.802
It doesn't have to be Girving.
It could be Goldie, Goldie's--

27:32.692 --> 27:34.319
Miss Dee. Hi. I'm Jackie.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.405
I'll be escorting you inside today.
If you could just put this on for me?

27:37.489 --> 27:38.323
Thank you.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.369
-Hey, Sam.
-Hey, Jackie.

27:42.952 --> 27:45.872
-I'll leave you in Sam's capable hands.
-Thank you, Jackie.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.131
Welcome back, Miss Dee.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.008
Thank you, Sam.

28:14.401 --> 28:15.568
Hello, Johnny.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.491
Hello, Mum.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.956
-How are you, Johnny? Are you well?

28:29.874 --> 28:33.420
Same as ever.
Slightly bored. Highly medicated.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.382
The days are all the same in prison.

28:37.465 --> 28:40.009
Hospital, John, not prison.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.554
If it pleases you to think so.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.557
What did the doctors say?

28:45.640 --> 28:48.309
How's your therapy going?

28:49.394 --> 28:52.355
Is that your way of asking me
if I've forgiven you yet?

28:55.650 --> 28:57.694
You're fine, aren't you, darling?

28:58.820 --> 28:59.988
You've come a long way.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.240
I'm proud of you.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.119
Are you trying to convince me or yourself?

29:06.202 --> 29:08.830
I'm trying to have
a conversation with my son.

29:12.208 --> 29:13.501
We do need to talk.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.211
That rarely goes well for either of us.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.922
Perhaps I should ask the guard
to come in and referee.

29:22.051 --> 29:25.430
We need to talk about… the ruby.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.456
Hello, Irving. I mean, Goldie.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.709
I'll call you Goldie for Cain's sake,

29:55.335 --> 29:58.087
but I think of you as Irving, really.
In my heart.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.299
He can't help it. It's not his fault.

30:01.382 --> 30:04.344
It's who he is. It's who we are.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.971
The first murderer, the first victim.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.348
This is our story.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.684
Do you even know what a story is?

30:12.435 --> 30:13.561
Should I tell you one?

30:15.396 --> 30:16.606
It's a secret story.

30:18.817 --> 30:23.363
It's a story about two brothers
who loved each other very, very much.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.907
And they were very nice to each other.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.075
Nice and kind.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.868
And… and brotherly, you know?

30:30.537 --> 30:34.249
And the elder brother
never harmed the younger brother ever.

30:36.417 --> 30:40.129
And they didn't live in different houses.
They lived together in the same house.

30:45.718 --> 30:48.930
And they'd be… happy.

30:51.891 --> 30:55.395
I don't mind getting murdered, honestly.
If that's what makes Cain happy, then…

30:55.979 --> 30:58.940
Hey, what are brothers for,
eh, little brother?

31:00.525 --> 31:01.359
Come on, then.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.862
Shall we say good morning to Cain?

31:03.945 --> 31:05.196
-Oh.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.406
I'll be fine.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.075
He never normally murders me before lunch.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.661
He's not much of a morning person.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.955
Like me. Or you, apparently.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.833
May I ask
where you're off to, sire?

31:16.916 --> 31:17.959
London.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.420
Did you not just spend
the last 100 years there?

31:21.754 --> 31:24.048
Sorry. Why London?

31:24.132 --> 31:26.009
The sand was sold there.

31:27.594 --> 31:31.055
When I have it back,
I will seek out my helm.

31:32.682 --> 31:33.641
In Hell.

31:34.976 --> 31:35.852
Oh, dear.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.190
Then will you grant me
one favor before you go?

31:41.983 --> 31:43.735
Take a raven with you.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.738
No more ravens.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.781
If not for you, then for me.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.410
A raven can go back and forth
between realms.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.746
-Keep me informed--
-I do not need a minder.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.917
I am Dream of The Endless.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.128
Yes, and Dream of The Endless
always has a raven.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.631
Jessamy was the last.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.929
If this Constantine
is anything like her ancestor,

32:11.012 --> 32:12.722
she will serve me well enough.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.309
She is only human.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.482
As was Roderick Burgess.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.077
What could possibly go wrong?

33:00.812 --> 33:03.898
Oh, good. You've returned.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.985
And just in time too.
His Lordship will be pleased.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.320
Where is Dream?

33:09.404 --> 33:12.490
He's away. Again. For the moment.

33:12.573 --> 33:16.411
He's out there
looking for his tools, isn't he?

33:16.494 --> 33:17.745
He will be coming back.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.207
Well, then, I'd better get a move on.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.500
Where are you going?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.002
Back to the waking world.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.547
To freedom. You should try it sometime.

33:27.630 --> 33:30.675
Dreams and Nightmares
do not belong in the waking world.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.301
Oh, turns out I fit right in.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.095
Have you no loyalty to your creator?

33:34.178 --> 33:37.348
Why should I? He has no loyalty to us.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.100
You misunderstand him, Corinthian.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.102
Oh, no, I see him for what he is.

33:42.437 --> 33:46.065
He doesn't give a fuck about you or me.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.359
He only cares about himself.

33:48.943 --> 33:50.403
His kingdom.

33:51.654 --> 33:52.864
Well, he can have it.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.660
'Cause I am leaving
and I am never coming back.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.871
He will come after you.

33:59.954 --> 34:03.875
Well, then, if he does,
he won't be coming back either.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.505
You can't change him.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.967
You can't save him either.
