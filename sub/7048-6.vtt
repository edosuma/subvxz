00:02.031 --> 00:06.443
ATF inquiry 2359826.
Interview with Boyd Crowder.

00:06.577 --> 00:08.119
All right, and it was
during that conversation

00:08.245 --> 00:10.653
that Kyle made his first threats
against yourself and Mrs. Crowder?

00:10.790 --> 00:12.248
Miss Crowder.

00:12.374 --> 00:14.332
Against yourself and Ms. Crowder?

00:14.460 --> 00:16.915
I believe we've already
waded through these waters.

00:17.046 --> 00:18.326
Tell us again.

00:18.464 --> 00:19.923
They showed up at the house,

00:20.299 --> 00:23.253
said they were gonna rob the mine,
said they needed a powderman.

00:23.385 --> 00:26.801
Said if I didn't go along,
they'd put me and Ava in the ground.

00:26.931 --> 00:30.382
So you never actually heard Kyle
make these threats.

00:32.228 --> 00:35.063
Like I said, I was already gone to work.

00:35.481 --> 00:38.268
Meaning Boyd told you what Kyle said.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.859
Just like Boyd told you

00:39.985 --> 00:42.856
that morning was the first time he
heard about the plan to rob the mine.

00:42.988 --> 00:45.195
And it's not possible that he lied.

00:45.533 --> 00:46.943
Why would I lie?

00:47.076 --> 00:49.282
Because if you can
prove you were coerced,

00:49.411 --> 00:51.570
couldn't call the police
out of fear for your life,

00:51.705 --> 00:53.413
then you're not criminally responsible.

00:53.916 --> 00:57.083
I think we're all growing tired
of this babe-in-the-woods act.

00:57.211 --> 01:00.295
So I want you to tell us right now
where the rest of the money is.

01:00.422 --> 01:02.082
I thought it burnt up.

01:02.216 --> 01:04.043
Some of it burned up.

01:04.510 --> 01:07.879
Miss Crowder, do you realise that we
could charge you with felony murder?

01:08.013 --> 01:09.887
"Felony murder"?

01:10.015 --> 01:13.431
Is that like "hot lava" or "frozen ice"?

01:13.561 --> 01:14.806
No, ma'am, felony murder means

01:14.937 --> 01:17.013
if you knew the crime was
gonna be committed,

01:17.147 --> 01:19.105
even if you didn't know
anyone was gonna die,

01:19.233 --> 01:21.854
you're just as guilty
as if you pulled the trigger.

01:22.695 --> 01:25.268
After everything
your brother put her through,

01:25.406 --> 01:29.071
you really gonna let her spend the
rest of her life in prison for you?

01:29.785 --> 01:32.157
You know, I was just wondering,

01:32.580 --> 01:35.830
did she screw all your relatives
or just you two?

01:36.375 --> 01:40.622
Now, sir, I know you have
an investigation to conduct,

01:43.048 --> 01:47.710
but if you disrespect Ava one more
time, I'm gonna come across this table.

01:52.182 --> 01:53.511
Chief, it seems clear to me

01:53.642 --> 01:57.011
that Mr. Crowder just threatened
a federal officer.

01:57.563 --> 02:02.474
And I would think that that is reason
enough for you to take him into custody.

02:02.610 --> 02:08.233
Much as I might like to personally throw
Mr. Crowder's ass in a holding cell,

02:08.365 --> 02:12.529
I think a threat against a federal
officer would be a little more specific,

02:12.661 --> 02:14.535
something more along the lines of,

02:14.663 --> 02:19.824
"If you disrespect Miss Crowder again,
I'll beat the ever-loving shit out of you."

02:22.546 --> 02:24.005
You gonna charge me?

02:38.020 --> 02:40.593
- I have to get my purse.
- Okay.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.976
- Raylan.
- Boyd.

02:46.445 --> 02:49.861
I am impressed.
How is it possible you're not in cuffs?

02:52.409 --> 02:55.659
Well, when someone's threatening
a woman that you care deeply for,

02:55.788 --> 03:00.366
there's no end to the lengths that
you will go to keep that woman safe.

03:00.501 --> 03:05.079
Now, I seem to recall you being
in that situation a time or two yourself.

03:06.632 --> 03:08.043
In fact,

03:08.175 --> 03:12.802
I seem to recall you being in the
same situation with the same woman.

03:14.348 --> 03:16.175
Ain't that something?

03:29.488 --> 03:30.947
Just tell me what you did, Gary.

03:31.073 --> 03:33.646
I am trying to tell you what I did,
if you would just give me five minutes

03:33.784 --> 03:35.159
- to listen to me!
- Don't try to tell me what you did.

03:35.285 --> 03:37.029
- Tell me what you did!
- You don't even listen to me anyway.

03:37.162 --> 03:40.163
I'm trying to find a legitimate way for us
to get out of this hole that we are in!

03:40.290 --> 03:41.950
- You either tell me or I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

03:42.084 --> 03:44.242
You just wait five minutes
and let me talk to you

03:44.378 --> 03:45.493
instead of getting mad all the time?

03:45.629 --> 03:48.915
- Then talk to me, Gary!
- I am trying to tell you what I did, all right?

03:51.885 --> 03:55.089
You put up our house as collateral
for a goddamn horse?

03:55.222 --> 03:57.131
It is a champion Arabian, Winona!

03:57.266 --> 03:58.641
You're not listening
to a damn thing I've said!

03:58.767 --> 04:00.511
After everything that has happened,
everything, Gary,

04:00.644 --> 04:02.186
after everything that has happened,
you did that,

04:02.312 --> 04:03.392
and you didn't talk to me about it?

04:03.522 --> 04:06.938
Well, where do I find you, Winona?
Where do I find you, huh?

04:07.067 --> 04:08.609
- That's enough.
- What?

04:08.736 --> 04:10.230
- You're gonna walk out now?
- I'm leaving.

04:10.362 --> 04:13.149
You haven't even looked at this,
all right? I worked all...

04:13.282 --> 04:14.527
Winona!

04:50.194 --> 04:53.859
- I missed you last night.
- Last night, I was working late.

04:53.989 --> 04:57.323
You should have called. I was up
half the night staring at the ceiling.

04:57.451 --> 04:59.278
Thinking about what?

05:00.120 --> 05:03.323
You think all I'm doing when I'm lying
in bed alone is thinking about you?

05:03.665 --> 05:04.661
Not necessarily.

05:04.792 --> 05:07.662
There was a good five or six minutes
when I didn't think about you once.

05:10.589 --> 05:13.590
I have plenty of other
things on my mind.

05:13.717 --> 05:15.211
Like what?

05:15.344 --> 05:19.009
I don't know. Maybe the fact
that my soon-to-be second ex-husband

05:19.139 --> 05:22.259
just remortgaged our last asset
to buy a horse.

05:23.852 --> 05:26.723
- It's not funny.
- It's a little bit funny.

05:28.398 --> 05:29.727
I'm sorry.

05:30.609 --> 05:33.182
Look, I wish there was
something I could do.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.689
Well, you could tell me
everything's gonna be okay.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.073
I said, you could tell me
everything's gonna be okay.

05:40.869 --> 05:43.076
- I don't have a key to that.
- What?

05:43.831 --> 05:45.408
Only Weaver's got a key to the cage.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.452
Okay, so when I asked you
to let me into evidence,

05:48.585 --> 05:51.372
you don't think that was a good time to
tell me you didn't have a key to that?

05:51.505 --> 05:54.541
Well, I thought you just meant the
evidence room, not the cage.

05:54.675 --> 05:57.047
Since when do files
have to be put in the cage?

05:57.177 --> 06:00.012
They're my transcripts
from the coal flyrock case.

06:00.138 --> 06:03.389
Judge Reardon's worried 'cause of all
the coverage and tempers are all...

06:03.517 --> 06:06.055
So he's got you putting them in a
lockbox, guarded by an armed man?

06:06.186 --> 06:07.467
- Yeah.
- Seems excessive.

06:07.604 --> 06:09.561
You think Judge Reardon's excessive?

06:15.112 --> 06:17.567
So we wait.

06:18.615 --> 06:21.367
Sure Weaver will be here any minute.

06:21.493 --> 06:24.162
You don't have to go to work?

06:24.288 --> 06:27.538
It's a circus up there.
Happy to avoid it.

06:39.344 --> 06:43.638
You remember that night Gary was
waiting for you outside your motel?

06:45.267 --> 06:47.390
Did me touching you
just remind you of Gary?

06:47.519 --> 06:49.346
No. No.

06:50.147 --> 06:52.270
It reminded me of that night

06:52.399 --> 06:55.483
when you told me
about the pregnant fugitive.

07:00.282 --> 07:03.034
Just, it got me wondering if maybe,

07:04.578 --> 07:07.151
I don't know, maybe we had changed.

07:09.082 --> 07:11.573
Like maybe it doesn't have to end
the way it did the first time.

07:14.546 --> 07:17.002
Two rocking chairs on the porch.

07:18.425 --> 07:21.296
Bunch of little Raylans
running around with toy guns.

07:25.349 --> 07:28.765
Aren't you the one who said
it wouldn't be fair to have a kid

07:28.894 --> 07:30.602
as long as every morning
I walked out the door

07:30.729 --> 07:33.054
you felt like I might
never walk back in?

07:33.649 --> 07:36.140
What if there wasn't that chance?

07:36.568 --> 07:37.564
Meaning what?

07:37.694 --> 07:39.651
Meaning what if
when you walk through the door,

07:39.780 --> 07:42.105
you weren't walking through the door
to come here?

07:49.206 --> 07:51.245
And once again, we have silence.

07:51.375 --> 07:53.581
Well, I guess things haven't changed
so much after all, have they?

07:53.710 --> 07:56.628
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

08:03.512 --> 08:05.421
Don't you ever wonder?

08:08.976 --> 08:10.351
Sure. Yeah.

08:12.646 --> 08:13.926
I wonder.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.146
But?

08:20.112 --> 08:21.191
That'll be Weaver.

08:23.490 --> 08:26.859
Charlie, Ms. Hawkins needs
to get in the cage.

08:28.578 --> 08:29.777
Okay.

08:36.962 --> 08:40.129
Main lockboxes are all full up,
but that's okay.

08:40.256 --> 08:42.794
We got some old ones back here
don't get used any more.

08:45.262 --> 08:46.804
This is Weaver.

08:49.933 --> 08:51.807
Yeah. ATF. I know.

08:51.935 --> 08:53.014
All right.

08:54.813 --> 08:56.936
- You mind taking it from here?
- No.

08:57.065 --> 08:59.473
These are all marked.
I got to get to this.

08:59.609 --> 09:01.104
Reception down here is for shit.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.941
- All right. I'll just yell if I need you.
- All right. I'll come shooting.

09:04.072 --> 09:05.448
Okay. Okay.

09:46.239 --> 09:48.232
How are you doing, sir?

09:48.867 --> 09:49.863
There you go.

09:50.243 --> 09:51.323
Next.

09:52.788 --> 09:54.531
Next in line. Next.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.617
That's you, honey.

10:05.258 --> 10:06.338
Back away from the counter!

10:06.468 --> 10:08.544
Anybody tries to trip the silents
gets a bullet for himself

10:08.678 --> 10:10.422
and one for the guy next to him.

10:11.556 --> 10:12.967
Everybody down!

10:13.100 --> 10:14.475
Easy, son.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.598
You don't want to die
for somebody else's money.

10:17.729 --> 10:19.638
- Get your ass away from that phone!
- Ladies.

10:19.773 --> 10:20.971
- Everybody move around front.
- Get your ass down!

10:21.108 --> 10:23.396
Everybody on the floor! Do it! Now!

10:23.527 --> 10:27.476
All right. Wallets and jewellery, people.
Walk. Walk.

10:28.949 --> 10:30.063
Yeah.

10:33.036 --> 10:35.325
- There you go.
- Stay down!

10:35.455 --> 10:38.492
Get your ass away from that phone!
Stay down!

10:39.918 --> 10:41.626
Get the other end.

10:45.924 --> 10:49.091
Hands face down in front of you,
away from your pockets!

10:51.012 --> 10:54.428
Now... Nice. Nice.

10:59.354 --> 11:02.272
Well, ain't you a piece?

11:02.399 --> 11:04.972
Flip over, darlin'.
Let's see what you got.

11:10.657 --> 11:12.780
What else you got worth taking, huh?

11:16.121 --> 11:18.446
Open your hand. Open it.

11:19.499 --> 11:21.041
Open your hand.

11:21.668 --> 11:22.996
Other one.

11:24.045 --> 11:27.082
- I won't ask again. I'll just break your fingers.
- It's time.

11:31.344 --> 11:33.052
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Thatagirl.

11:36.808 --> 11:38.717
Come on, man, let's go!

11:47.485 --> 11:49.063
Come on, man!

11:52.490 --> 11:54.732
Let's go, fellas. Time to go.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.633
I don't get it.

12:11.134 --> 12:13.459
All the times I ran you
through how to act...

12:13.595 --> 12:15.054
I told you, it was instinct.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.757
What to do if a guy
breaks into your home,

12:16.890 --> 12:19.132
what to do if a guy grabs you
on the street, what to do...

12:19.267 --> 12:21.307
Looks like there's a lot of drama
going on in there.

12:21.978 --> 12:25.145
If a guy with a gun wants your shit,
you give it to him double-quick.

12:25.273 --> 12:27.847
- You don't look him in the eye.
- Raylan, I'm fine.

12:29.819 --> 12:32.393
Art looks spun up, though.
Did he see something on the video?

12:33.823 --> 12:36.149
- Apparently he recognised one of them.
- Which one?

12:36.701 --> 12:40.699
Frank Reasoner,
the old guy with the oxygen tank.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.701
Turns out 30 years ago
he was on the Ten Most Wanted list.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.040
- For what, robbing banks?
- Apparently a lot of them.

12:46.169 --> 12:48.660
Got a place in Miami, one in Bahamas.

12:48.797 --> 12:51.667
Used to fly himself back and forth
in his own King Air.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.839
What's he been doing
for the past 30 years?

12:53.969 --> 12:56.045
- He's been doing 30 years.
- Really?

12:57.055 --> 12:59.842
Got compassionate parole back in June,
emphysema.

12:59.975 --> 13:01.255
Wasn't supposed to
make it six months.

13:01.393 --> 13:03.219
I thought that oxygen thing
was just for show.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.926
Stopped checking in with his
P.O. Officer a month ago.

13:06.064 --> 13:07.262
So he's our fugitive.

13:07.399 --> 13:08.430
What about the other two?

13:09.985 --> 13:12.024
Haven't ID'd them yet.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.480
The one who kicked me in the face.

13:14.614 --> 13:17.485
If you get the chance,
shoot him in the nuts.

13:26.585 --> 13:28.411
I ought to hear this.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.628
Mrs. Reasoner,
I hope you're not trying to deny

13:32.757 --> 13:34.382
that your husband is
the man in that video.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.300
No, I'm not.

13:36.428 --> 13:38.835
I mean, it looks like him. It's just...

13:39.264 --> 13:41.256
I don't see how that's possible.

13:41.391 --> 13:45.223
No? You don't see how it's possible
a guy could get out of prison,

13:45.353 --> 13:47.761
go back to committing the same crime
he went away for?

13:47.897 --> 13:50.602
Frank was a model inmate.
He preached at the prison church.

13:50.734 --> 13:53.225
Mrs. Reasoner, yeah,
we read the parole report.

13:54.154 --> 13:57.819
How's he been since his release?
What's he been like?

13:57.949 --> 13:59.858
We've been living a simple life.

14:00.076 --> 14:02.448
Frank's a deacon at Calvary Baptist.

14:02.787 --> 14:06.287
When he's not there, he spends
most of his time on a computer.

14:06.416 --> 14:09.168
His condition doesn't let him
do much physically.

14:09.627 --> 14:11.786
He plays video games.

14:13.256 --> 14:17.005
He uses the interweb
to look up news about his old friends.

14:17.135 --> 14:20.171
He even taught himself
how to use the video chat

14:20.305 --> 14:22.630
so we could talk with the grandkids.

14:22.849 --> 14:26.432
Mrs. Reasoner, do you recognise either
of the other two men in the video?

14:26.978 --> 14:28.556
I don't think so.

14:29.314 --> 14:33.146
Maybe they forced him to join them.
You know, like in that movie.

14:33.443 --> 14:34.558
Maybe.

14:34.694 --> 14:37.779
Although the man in the video
looks like a willing participant.

14:37.906 --> 14:41.690
Jenny, does Frank have any big
bills lately that you know about,

14:41.826 --> 14:45.160
any big expenditures or
maybe medical bills?

14:45.914 --> 14:48.239
No. What if something happened to...

14:48.833 --> 14:52.000
I don't know, his mind, you know,
his brain because of oxygen?

14:52.128 --> 14:53.836
You know, because of the emphysema.

14:56.383 --> 14:59.170
Look at that shit.
Look at that. Look at that.

14:59.302 --> 15:00.844
Frank, you see this? You kidding?

15:00.970 --> 15:02.251
Get out of here.

15:02.389 --> 15:05.343
Smell that. Smell that.
Now add in Versailles.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.928
We're not going to Versailles.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.969
What are you talking about?
You always said pull another job,

15:09.104 --> 15:10.812
doubles your money,
keeps the law scrambling.

15:10.939 --> 15:14.806
I also said only shoot
when you have no other choice.

15:14.943 --> 15:17.860
I heard you tell that old boy
move and he'd get shot.

15:17.987 --> 15:19.232
Well, he moved.

15:20.907 --> 15:25.119
And what about that girl that you
stroked and then drop-kicked?

15:25.703 --> 15:27.198
Frank, she was holding out on us.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.038
She's lucky I didn't
shoot her in the face.

15:29.249 --> 15:34.207
Bobby, I could never pull a job
with a man I can't trust to hold himself.

15:34.587 --> 15:36.461
- Frank, just hold on a second. He's...
- You know what?

15:36.589 --> 15:38.665
You don't have to beg
him for shit, okay?

15:38.967 --> 15:42.003
You and I will do the Versailles job
on our own. Right?

15:42.137 --> 15:43.417
Who knows?

15:43.555 --> 15:46.924
It might even be a blessing
not having this old lunger along.

15:47.725 --> 15:48.805
Ain't that right?

15:49.727 --> 15:51.186
Frank. Frank. Frank.

15:51.312 --> 15:53.388
Frank. What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing, Frank?

15:53.523 --> 15:54.768
I got you figured.

15:54.899 --> 15:58.149
You did most of your growing up in
those juvie-detention gladiator schools.

15:58.278 --> 15:59.855
Didn't mean no harm. He's just talking.

15:59.988 --> 16:04.733
I guess Bobby didn't tell you I was the
bench-press champion at Lewisburg.

16:05.076 --> 16:07.781
The next time you make
me raise my voice,

16:07.912 --> 16:12.242
I'm gonna take this oxygen tank, and I'm
gonna beat your ass to death with it.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.454
Frank!

16:20.425 --> 16:23.046
Yep. That's him. Who is he?

16:23.178 --> 16:25.051
Bobby Green, carjacker.

16:25.180 --> 16:28.845
Did a few years at Lewisburg
when Reasoner was there.

16:28.975 --> 16:30.766
Still nothing on the guy
who stomped on my face?

16:30.894 --> 16:32.471
We figure he's a friend of Green's.

16:34.439 --> 16:35.850
- Hi.
- Howdy.

16:36.107 --> 16:37.103
What's that?

16:37.233 --> 16:40.151
Serial numbers from the bills
they took out of the cash drawer.

16:40.278 --> 16:44.821
We red-flag them, then if they spend
them anywhere that uses the database,

16:44.949 --> 16:48.034
- we do what we do.
- I know. Big brother, right?

16:49.370 --> 16:51.162
You don't really expect to catch them
that way.

16:51.289 --> 16:53.080
No. Lag time's too long.

16:53.458 --> 16:56.031
Most places don't scan
more than once a day.

16:56.169 --> 16:58.790
By the time we get a hit,
the perp's usually long gone.

16:58.922 --> 17:00.998
So it's really just red
tape for the bank, then.

17:01.132 --> 17:04.666
Actually, it's mostly for the Secret
Service. You ever hear of superdollars?

17:05.512 --> 17:07.054
It's counterfeit hundreds
from North Korea.

17:07.180 --> 17:09.172
Whole Treasury
Department's obsessed.

17:09.307 --> 17:12.012
You believe they make us scan
every bill that goes into evidence?

17:13.685 --> 17:15.015
Pain in the ass.

17:15.688 --> 17:17.681
Deputy Gutterson,
I hope you're not suggesting

17:17.816 --> 17:20.141
that protecting the integrity
of our national currency

17:20.276 --> 17:22.233
is a waste of your valuable time.

17:22.362 --> 17:25.148
No, ma'am, nothing I'd rather be doing.

17:43.091 --> 17:45.130
I think I have a problem.

17:52.850 --> 17:55.602
Okay, now, I want you to tell me again.

17:56.062 --> 17:57.853
- I just...
- Not yet.

17:58.189 --> 17:59.220
Okay. Now.

17:59.357 --> 18:02.109
I just wanted to make sure it was real.

18:02.235 --> 18:03.397
- Wanted to make sure it was real.
- Yeah,

18:03.528 --> 18:06.445
otherwise it's not worth the headache
and all the paperwork

18:06.573 --> 18:08.814
and besides, I was gonna put it back,
and then all the...

18:08.950 --> 18:11.073
Okay, wait.
Let me just make sure I got this.

18:11.202 --> 18:13.872
You took one bill, and you
wanted to make sure it was real.

18:13.997 --> 18:16.570
But then you're standing in line at
the bank, you come to your senses.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.744
So you start to leave, but Frank
Reasoner and his boys take it off you.

18:19.878 --> 18:21.621
I don't need you to tell me
I did a stupid thing, Raylan.

18:21.754 --> 18:22.952
I know I did a stupid thing.

18:23.089 --> 18:24.963
What I need you to tell me is
how big of a deal it's gonna be

18:25.091 --> 18:26.585
when you catch these guys

18:26.718 --> 18:28.461
and run those bills
through the Federal Reserve database

18:28.595 --> 18:31.132
and one of them pops because it's
supposed to be in the evidence cage.

18:31.264 --> 18:33.138
It's one bill. It's a clerical error.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.511
Worst-case scenario, they
come to look for it.

18:34.642 --> 18:36.599
"They"? Is "they" the Secret Service?

18:36.728 --> 18:38.222
'Cause I heard Tim
mention something about that.

18:38.354 --> 18:39.517
Yeah.

18:40.523 --> 18:41.982
- Raylan, is that you?
- Yeah!

18:42.108 --> 18:43.567
- Chief wants you.
- Right now?

18:43.693 --> 18:45.732
- Reasoner's trying to get a hold of his wife.
- Okay.

18:45.862 --> 18:47.653
Tell him I'm coming.

18:48.031 --> 18:51.696
Do you really think there's a chance
they'll just ignore it, though?

18:54.996 --> 18:56.407
I got to go.

19:03.421 --> 19:06.126
This guy texts his wife,
tell her he wants to video-chat.

19:06.257 --> 19:09.626
When he went away, no one had heard of a
computer you could fit in your living room.

19:09.886 --> 19:10.965
Art?

19:12.388 --> 19:14.926
- Where are we, Chris?
- Thirty seconds.

19:15.058 --> 19:16.256
Art, I need a word.

19:16.392 --> 19:18.634
As you can see, Raylan,
we're kind of busy at the moment.

19:18.770 --> 19:21.771
If we get a line on these guys,
can I be the first through the door?

19:22.982 --> 19:26.102
Why? 'Cause of that whack
that punk gave your ex-wife?

19:27.028 --> 19:28.143
Yeah.

19:33.117 --> 19:35.110
For God's sakes, Raylan.

19:36.162 --> 19:37.989
I'm not gonna let you
be on the entry team.

19:38.122 --> 19:40.530
But I'll let you be there
when it goes down.

19:40.917 --> 19:43.075
And then maybe you can make sure
the guy whacks his head

19:43.211 --> 19:44.622
when you put him in the car.

19:44.754 --> 19:46.497
- Happy?
- Yeah.

19:46.631 --> 19:47.959
- Ready, Chief.
- All right,

19:48.091 --> 19:50.712
let's go, Mrs. Reasoner, right here.

19:53.012 --> 19:55.171
- Honey?
<i>- I'm here, Jenny.</i>

19:56.349 --> 19:57.345
<i>Where are you?</i>

19:57.475 --> 20:00.180
I'm at the break room at work.

20:00.311 --> 20:02.933
Frank, please come home.

20:03.231 --> 20:04.689
<i>That's what I'm trying to do.</i>

20:04.816 --> 20:07.935
Well, I don't understand why you're
doing it this way. Why don't you just...

20:08.069 --> 20:10.690
<i>I need to talk to
whoever's in charge.</i>

20:10.988 --> 20:13.444
<i>I imagine we're talking Marshals</i>

20:13.950 --> 20:17.366
<i>'cause I'm violating
my compassionate parole.</i>

20:17.495 --> 20:19.535
<i>But maybe it's the FBI.</i>

20:20.498 --> 20:23.784
<i>Which... Anyway,
whichever one of you's in charge,</i>

20:24.794 --> 20:26.751
<i>I need you to get on the line.</i>

20:29.424 --> 20:31.712
Chief Deputy Art Mullen, Mr. Reasoner.

20:31.843 --> 20:33.301
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you.</i>

20:33.720 --> 20:35.297
<i>I love you, Jen.</i>

20:36.097 --> 20:40.842
<i>But now I need you to go outside
so I can have a word with the chief.</i>

20:40.977 --> 20:43.266
Right this way, Mrs. Reasoner.

20:48.401 --> 20:50.808
<i>- Is she gone?</i>
- Just you and me.

20:52.155 --> 20:54.480
<i>Thirty guys in the next room?</i>

20:56.367 --> 20:59.154
Mr. Reasoner, let's talk
about how we can end this business

20:59.287 --> 21:01.196
without anybody else getting hurt.

21:01.748 --> 21:04.784
<i>First of all, you saw the video.</i>

21:05.752 --> 21:08.503
<i>You saw I never intended
for anyone to be hurt.</i>

21:08.629 --> 21:11.630
Well, we saw that it was the kid
that stomped the woman

21:11.758 --> 21:13.216
and that did the shooting.

21:13.342 --> 21:15.050
But you're the one who
brought him along.

21:15.344 --> 21:19.176
<i>Wasn't my first choice.
I can promise you that.</i>

21:19.307 --> 21:21.264
So he was a friend of Bobby Green's?

21:21.392 --> 21:23.301
<i>You boys work fast.</i>

21:25.229 --> 21:26.225
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:27.064 --> 21:29.982
<i>Bobby don't have the
best taste in friends.</i>

21:30.109 --> 21:31.901
<i>But he's a good boy.</i>

21:32.945 --> 21:34.903
<i>Only way I'm coming in</i>

21:35.239 --> 21:37.813
<i>is if you'll promise
to go easy on him.</i>

21:37.950 --> 21:39.860
Well, that's a question
for the US Attorney,

21:39.994 --> 21:42.532
but I'm sure that we can
work something out.

21:42.663 --> 21:44.703
What about the other one, the friend?

21:44.832 --> 21:47.454
<i>Like I said, he's not my friend.</i>

21:47.835 --> 21:51.169
You know, it was me that was
chasing you back in the day.

21:51.297 --> 21:53.870
I thought maybe collaring you
would make my name.

21:54.425 --> 21:55.588
<i>Is that a fact?</i>

21:56.427 --> 21:59.796
I missed you by about an hour
at that flophouse in Memphis.

21:59.931 --> 22:01.306
You remember that?

22:01.432 --> 22:05.097
<i>The one with the Blessed
Virgin wallpaper.</i>

22:06.896 --> 22:08.853
And the plastic drapes.

22:09.565 --> 22:10.763
<i>So that was you.</i>

22:12.944 --> 22:18.614
<i>Well, it looks like the good Lord
is handing you a second chance.</i>

22:19.200 --> 22:22.403
I'm just waiting for the good Lord
to tell me where to go.

22:22.745 --> 22:26.031
<i>You know, I was planning on
getting a good haul</i>

22:26.165 --> 22:28.703
<i>and getting it to Jenny on the sly</i>

22:28.835 --> 22:34.173
<i>and keep pulling jobs
till I went out in a blaze of glory.</i>

22:35.758 --> 22:40.669
<i>Kept saying I wasn't gonna
let myself die on a ventilator</i>

22:40.805 --> 22:43.640
<i>in some hospital room.</i>

22:43.766 --> 22:44.845
Mr. Reasoner...

22:44.976 --> 22:47.348
<i>Tates Creek bridge.</i>

22:48.437 --> 22:49.766
<i>Two hours.</i>

22:53.025 --> 22:54.223
We have what we need?

22:54.360 --> 22:57.646
We'll have cars on either side of the
bridge, plus Tim will be set up.

22:57.780 --> 22:58.978
You got a spot picked out?

22:59.115 --> 23:01.072
There's a big rise next to the road
on the north side,

23:01.200 --> 23:03.691
- makes kind of a natural bird's nest.
- All right.

23:03.828 --> 23:06.580
This guy kind of sounded like he might
want to go out in a blaze of glory.

23:06.706 --> 23:10.240
Suicide by cop?
Saving himself from dying in prison?

23:10.376 --> 23:12.499
- So be ready for that.
- Always.

23:13.004 --> 23:15.577
The tech tell you how long it'd take
to trace that video call?

23:15.715 --> 23:18.170
- Too long.
- Must be why he used it.

23:18.634 --> 23:19.713
Yep.

23:21.888 --> 23:24.557
Something not sitting right with you?

23:25.099 --> 23:27.804
You really think he's gonna be there?

23:27.935 --> 23:29.679
- No.
- No.

23:33.065 --> 23:36.315
How long would it take us
to get up on Reasoner's computer?

23:36.444 --> 23:38.271
I'll get right on it.

23:44.076 --> 23:48.454
Now are you sure you don't want
to be the one wearing this, you know?

23:48.581 --> 23:50.704
Maybe go out with a bang.

23:52.084 --> 23:55.952
Shit, could be your ticket
to a paradise full of virgins.

23:58.591 --> 24:00.963
- We ready to go?
- Five by five.

24:04.055 --> 24:07.091
- You know...
- Frank, Frank, what are you doing? Okay.

24:07.224 --> 24:09.134
On second thought,

24:09.268 --> 24:12.684
beating your ass to death
is a little ambitious health-wise.

24:12.813 --> 24:15.565
Are we really gonna do
this again, man? Okay.

24:15.691 --> 24:19.274
But on the bright side,
you get to go out with a bang.

24:20.571 --> 24:23.109
Now, give my regards to the virgins.

24:25.534 --> 24:26.945
Oh, God...

24:35.670 --> 24:37.496
I can't decide if I
should beat you to death

24:37.630 --> 24:41.081
or leave you drowning in the air
like a landed fish!

24:43.552 --> 24:45.426
You know what? Shit.

24:46.472 --> 24:47.635
- On second thought...
- No.

24:47.765 --> 24:49.639
Carter, come on, man. We've got to go.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.345
That armoured car gets
there before we do,

24:51.477 --> 24:54.727
put the money behind the time lock,
we're shit out of luck.

24:55.272 --> 24:58.226
- How's our man-power situation?
- Down to the felt.

24:58.943 --> 25:02.727
FBI's got the whole office in the field.
We're down to three.

25:02.863 --> 25:05.070
- Including me?
- Four.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.156
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah.

25:07.284 --> 25:09.443
You get into Reasoner's hard drive?

25:09.578 --> 25:10.777
What am I, an asshole?

25:12.665 --> 25:13.661
No.

25:14.667 --> 25:17.952
- Chris created a mirror thing...
- Mirror drive.

25:18.087 --> 25:20.329
Mirror drive of Reasoner's computer.

25:20.464 --> 25:23.668
And we've been through everything
but the games. Haven't found shit.

25:23.801 --> 25:24.880
Not even porn?

25:25.011 --> 25:27.680
Well, we haven't found shit
that would tell us where he might be.

25:28.097 --> 25:29.721
Chief, we just got an anonymous call

25:29.849 --> 25:32.055
saying Bobby Green
and somebody named Carter Hayes

25:32.184 --> 25:34.722
just walked into First Cumberland
in Versailles.

26:16.103 --> 26:17.930
Special Agent Davi,
Special Agent Burnes.

26:18.064 --> 26:19.855
- You're Givens?
- Yep.

26:20.524 --> 26:21.556
They only sent one of you?

26:22.193 --> 26:24.944
- One riot, one ranger.
- Meaning you guys think the call's bogus?

26:25.071 --> 26:28.274
Meaning we're spread so thin right now,
there's no one else left in the office.

26:28.407 --> 26:29.652
What'd you see?

26:29.784 --> 26:34.327
Well, I didn't get a good visual,
but the patrons I did see looked calm.

26:34.455 --> 26:36.827
Last time, they waited in line,
cased the place first.

26:36.957 --> 26:39.116
Basically somebody needs to
go in there casual and take a look.

26:39.251 --> 26:40.794
I'll do that.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.711
The old man's our fugitive, right?

26:42.838 --> 26:44.878
Well, we'll cover the perimeter
in case you need backup.

26:45.007 --> 26:46.382
Sounds like a plan.

27:02.650 --> 27:04.274
Son of a bitch.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.915
Gentlemen, keep your hands
where I can see them.

28:02.168 --> 28:03.994
Nice and easy.

28:04.128 --> 28:05.836
Are you all by yourself, Marshal?

28:07.882 --> 28:10.752
Everybody on the ground!
This is a robbery!

28:10.885 --> 28:13.423
Slowly! Slowly!

28:16.849 --> 28:19.304
I hope you're not counting on
your grandpa to give you backup.

28:19.810 --> 28:22.562
We might have to take him to hell
slightly before his time.

28:23.522 --> 28:24.685
Where's Frank?

28:24.982 --> 28:26.227
He was holding us up.

28:27.443 --> 28:28.937
We left him at the hotel, dying.

28:29.612 --> 28:32.103
Then who tipped us you were here?

28:41.415 --> 28:44.120
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

28:44.543 --> 28:46.999
- Car's gone.
- It got stolen?

28:47.421 --> 28:51.039
Hey, dumb shit, where's the money?

28:54.887 --> 28:56.262
In the car?

28:59.767 --> 29:01.759
Marshal, it's like this.

29:02.353 --> 29:06.137
We're waiting for the armoured car to
get here from the Keeneland racetrack.

29:07.358 --> 29:09.149
Now, it appears to be
running just a couple minutes late,

29:09.276 --> 29:12.941
but when it gets here, we're gonna
take our money and be on our way.

29:13.072 --> 29:14.447
Otherwise,

29:16.825 --> 29:18.652
I'm gonna have to huff and puff.

29:23.832 --> 29:24.947
Okay.

29:26.502 --> 29:27.581
Okay.

29:28.587 --> 29:30.995
Clearly, you're the smart one.

29:33.342 --> 29:35.880
I'm hoping you know what to do now.

29:54.738 --> 29:57.609
And you're the one
who kicks innocent women in the face.

29:59.535 --> 30:01.444
You mean that girl from this morning?

30:03.539 --> 30:05.615
She didn't seem so innocent.

30:06.333 --> 30:08.907
Does she taste as good as she looks?

30:14.174 --> 30:16.500
You know where I'm from, asshole?

30:16.760 --> 30:17.792
No.

30:18.679 --> 30:20.173
Harlan County.

30:21.098 --> 30:22.129
So?

30:24.018 --> 30:27.469
Down there, we know the difference
between dynamite and road flares.

30:31.984 --> 30:35.353
Okay, boys, this is a bank robbery.
It's all yours.

30:54.298 --> 30:56.705
Great. Okay.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.014
Mr. Reasoner.

31:05.934 --> 31:09.138
Guess you didn't believe
I was giving myself up.

31:11.065 --> 31:12.891
Hell, no one did.

31:13.025 --> 31:16.394
But I also didn't believe all that
"blaze of glory" bullshit.

31:16.653 --> 31:19.489
Found all those flight simulators
on your computer,

31:19.615 --> 31:23.529
and then I remembered that you used
to own a plane back in the day.

31:23.660 --> 31:25.618
Figured you were re-familiarising.

31:28.832 --> 31:30.540
I wouldn't do that.

31:30.918 --> 31:33.669
Unless you're rethinking
that "blaze of glory."

31:34.004 --> 31:37.290
Remember I used to teach firearms
back at Glynco.

31:37.925 --> 31:41.175
That why you came out here
all by your lonesome?

31:42.554 --> 31:46.718
'Cause you wanted to give me
the chance to high-noon it?

31:49.103 --> 31:51.060
No, I came out here all by lonesome

31:51.188 --> 31:54.723
'cause everybody at the office is out
fooling around with Bobby Green at the bank

31:54.858 --> 31:57.349
and that guy with the bomb vest.

31:58.070 --> 32:01.984
Was that your plan, send them
there and then dime them to us?

32:04.410 --> 32:05.785
Now, Reasoner,

32:07.246 --> 32:10.365
my knees are not gonna
hold up to a foot chase.

32:10.958 --> 32:14.576
If you run, I'm gonna put
a bullet in that tank.

32:14.711 --> 32:17.037
You remember the end of <i>Jaws?</i>

32:20.134 --> 32:21.296
Yeah.

32:22.678 --> 32:24.386
Yeah, I remember.

32:28.392 --> 32:30.266
Reasoner, don't...

32:36.191 --> 32:39.192
Oh, shit. Asshole.

32:42.239 --> 32:43.899
God damn it.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.612
Reasoner, stop!

33:16.648 --> 33:17.893
Damn!

33:18.400 --> 33:20.357
That shit really necessary?

33:22.362 --> 33:25.862
Bet you wish you'd quit smoking now.
Shit'll kill you.

33:36.835 --> 33:38.709
You got a family, Chief?

33:39.004 --> 33:42.124
Yep. Waiting on our third grandchild.

33:43.050 --> 33:44.793
You love your wife?

33:45.844 --> 33:47.552
Most of the time.

33:48.347 --> 33:49.627
Me, too.

33:51.058 --> 33:54.094
But when you start staring
down that barrel,

33:55.103 --> 33:59.350
you start thinking of all the lives
you never lived.

34:00.442 --> 34:01.853
Where were you headed?

34:02.319 --> 34:05.605
Little fishing village
outside Puerto Vallarta.

34:06.865 --> 34:09.735
To live out my days
in a hut on the beach

34:10.619 --> 34:13.869
drinking beer, mescal,

34:14.956 --> 34:17.447
and getting blowjobs from hookers.

34:18.627 --> 34:21.379
You really think your
ticker's up for all that?

34:22.965 --> 34:25.290
I was willing to give it a try.

34:32.474 --> 34:34.099
Come on, Chief.

34:34.726 --> 34:37.014
There's room for both of us.

34:37.145 --> 34:39.850
I reckon I'd better stay around here.

34:46.029 --> 34:48.235
Well, you were right.

34:48.364 --> 34:49.824
'Course I was right.

34:49.949 --> 34:52.239
I'm wondering if we should be worried
how sure you were

34:52.369 --> 34:56.663
he was planning to just take off
and give everyone the finger.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.079
Ask me again in 20 years.

34:59.209 --> 35:01.118
Whoa. Wait a second.

35:01.962 --> 35:05.247
- When did you get those?
- A couple days ago.

35:05.382 --> 35:07.838
My wife kept complaining
that I couldn't hear her,

35:07.968 --> 35:10.720
and I decided to get them anyway.

35:10.846 --> 35:12.922
You need me to carry that?

35:13.432 --> 35:15.305
- Kiss my ass.
- Seriously,

35:15.434 --> 35:18.933
you want me to take it into the office,
scan the money for you, it's not a problem.

35:20.063 --> 35:21.474
Yeah, that'd be good.

35:21.607 --> 35:25.984
I'm gonna get on home, start pricing
some flights to Puerto Vallarta.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.216
How are we?

35:50.010 --> 35:51.041
Hello to you, too.

35:51.178 --> 35:53.051
Come on, Raylan.
I've been climbing the walls.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.422
Fifteen years ago,
the Fed redesigned the hundred,

35:55.557 --> 35:58.262
changed the colours,
made the portrait bigger.

35:58.393 --> 36:01.180
If your bill was in the cage 20 years,
that means it was printed before that,

36:01.313 --> 36:03.886
so I went through every
hundred in that bag,

36:04.024 --> 36:07.689
and these are the only ones
where the portrait is still small.

36:08.028 --> 36:12.275
So if the bill you took was in the bag,
it has to be one of these.

36:12.407 --> 36:14.447
I don't know what to say.

36:16.244 --> 36:17.655
Thank you.

36:18.914 --> 36:21.286
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

36:37.057 --> 36:39.512
- Hurts still?
- Only when I breathe.

36:59.037 --> 37:02.869
You know we're gonna have to
talk about it, sooner or later.

37:08.005 --> 37:09.203
I know.
