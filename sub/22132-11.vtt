10:36.399 --> 10:41.860
away just like that just like that

10:39.578 --> 10:44.109
there we were out watching spin it opens

10:41.860 --> 10:45.159
and I suddenly realized just what am I

10:44.110 --> 10:46.870
thinking about

10:45.159 --> 10:49.809
he is the most wonderful man I've ever

10:46.870 --> 10:52.060
met mm I was so worried about what I

10:49.809 --> 10:53.859
might lose and I suddenly realized just

10:52.059 --> 10:56.409
how much i had to gain

10:53.860 --> 10:59.259
oh that's so awesome hey come on i have

10:56.409 --> 11:01.719
never felt like this before and you know

10:59.259 --> 11:02.528
what else I realized what I can't wait

11:01.720 --> 11:05.019
to hear this

11:02.528 --> 11:06.939
well I was so scared because I never

11:05.019 --> 11:07.810
thought I would ever end up with someone

11:06.940 --> 11:09.700
like him

11:07.809 --> 11:12.879
hmm well I think that's what we're all

11:09.700 --> 11:14.440
afraid of is finding the right guy or

11:12.879 --> 11:18.338
find them and visit

11:14.440 --> 11:20.980
well if I found him you will too i hope

11:18.339 --> 11:23.769
so

11:20.980 --> 11:27.399
ok heading the experimental submersible

11:23.769 --> 11:33.370
back to the harbor get that 75 feet

11:27.399 --> 11:37.778
air supply stable

11:33.370 --> 11:39.399
you can't control it the balance soft

11:37.778 --> 11:46.039
we're going down

11:39.399 --> 11:51.009
brace yourself

11:46.039 --> 12:00.909
hang on something

11:51.009 --> 12:09.360
it's rolling

12:00.909 --> 12:15.028
ok

12:09.360 --> 12:20.980
no I think everybody's gone dead go back

12:15.028 --> 12:26.629
to the surface can't

12:20.980 --> 12:29.750
we'll get some help

12:26.629 --> 12:33.919
Mayday Mayday this is experimental

12:29.750 --> 12:38.960
submersible 404 can you read me over

12:33.919 --> 12:44.389
Mayday Mayday this is experimental

12:38.960 --> 12:46.579
submersible 404 do you read the over

12:44.389 --> 12:50.989
made a meeting

12:46.578 --> 12:52.729
I can't make it out mayday signal so

12:50.989 --> 12:56.899
much study

12:52.730 --> 13:00.619
okay what is it mayday signal may watch

12:56.899 --> 13:03.318
why this project group on Lewis Baywatch

13:00.619 --> 13:04.850
why we picked up Annie permalink near

13:03.318 --> 13:07.669
your position registered to an

13:04.850 --> 13:08.928
experimental submersible yeah we've been

13:07.669 --> 13:11.389
listening to a faint garbled

13:08.928 --> 13:13.338
transmission could be the soap

alright we watching why will dispatch

13:13.339 --> 13:18.559
but appreciate your recon you are there

13:16.009 --> 13:22.428
special submersible is at 22 minutes 30

13:18.558 --> 13:23.480
seconds north 140 degrees thirty minutes

13:22.428 --> 13:27.528
west

13:23.480 --> 13:30.319
Roger that we're on our way

13:30.318 --> 13:35.509
scuba sure could use JD hey I'm

13:33.620 --> 13:38.149

14:21.750 --> 14:28.679
down submersible Mayday Mayday this is

14:26.009 --> 14:30.750
experimental submersible 404

14:28.679 --> 14:33.120
can anyone hear me let's go grab the

14:30.750 --> 14:41.190
regulator I got Thank get the weight

14:33.120 --> 14:44.310
belts anyone hear anything

14:41.190 --> 14:46.200
that's it ok always qualified Jason I've

14:44.309 --> 14:48.239

sorry not in this one already there

14:48.240 --> 14:57.669
okay to be Ali Nick me

14:55.208 --> 15:00.698
starting on a little bit they watched ye

14:57.669 --> 15:05.229
we are in position divers in the water

15:00.698 --> 15:05.889
Radio check Ali radically negative i got

15:05.230 --> 15:08.289
you shot

15:05.889 --> 15:12.009

15:08.289 --> 15:14.409
come for us how much time I don't know

15:12.009 --> 15:19.539
we only loaded enough air for one hour

15:14.409 --> 15:22.990
that's all that's what you requested you

15:19.539 --> 15:24.639
thought it might upset our buoyancy we

15:22.990 --> 15:29.829
don't have to worry about that now

15:24.639 --> 15:38.720
okay how long we've been under I don't

Jean Quan any sign of this versatile

15:44.649 --> 15:53.338
can't say anything yet

15:48.600 --> 15:57.930
now continuing to send depth reading 176

15:53.339 --> 15:59.819
and descending roger that see Ali ok go

15:57.929 --> 16:02.219
now let everyone know that help is on

15:59.818 --> 16:04.078
its way and right back up three

16:02.220 --> 16:06.778
decompression stages on the way back up

16:04.078 --> 16:09.629
first hundred fifty feet than 100 feet

16:06.778 --> 16:12.208
final decompression at 50 feet

16:09.629 --> 16:15.480
Roger that Ali has your mask its fine

16:12.208 --> 16:17.698
how do you read me on my farm

16:15.480 --> 16:19.860
same here the Coast Guard sending a buoy

16:17.698 --> 16:22.439
tender which has an inch enough cable to

16:19.860 --> 16:25.230
set up the subsurface there about 30

16:22.440 --> 16:33.329
minutes away right house if you're

16:25.230 --> 16:35.759
working there there is there's a

16:33.328 --> 16:39.469
submersible right where it's supposed to

16:35.759 --> 16:40.700
be

16:39.470 --> 16:45.370
I'll check the outside for any

16:40.700 --> 16:46.700
structural damage

16:45.370 --> 16:51.019
because this too

16:46.700 --> 16:57.290
inside their divers outside

16:51.019 --> 17:04.878
oh great great ok let's just stay calm

16:57.289 --> 17:07.818
professor I and get it it's just the

17:04.880 --> 17:10.309
lack of oxygen in here more excited you

17:07.818 --> 17:16.398
get quicker you use up what we've got

17:10.308 --> 17:23.388
Shawn over here take a look at this some

17:16.400 --> 17:36.470
kind of leak but he said battery acid

17:23.390 --> 17:47.140
good father i'll make sure they don't

17:36.470 --> 17:50.750
that's right down his answer

17:47.140 --> 17:52.880
running

17:50.750 --> 17:54.410
ok people their errors being

17:52.880 --> 17:59.000
contaminated we're gonna have to bring

17:54.410 --> 18:12.160
Sean there's no escape patch at least

17:59.000 --> 18:16.000
not that i can find

18:12.160 --> 18:20.080
this nicole whats the coast party yeah

18:16.000 --> 18:27.920
it's too late and counting

18:20.079 --> 18:31.009
Sean come here take a look at this boy

18:27.920 --> 18:33.170
see what I see ya another rupture in the

18:31.009 --> 18:35.240
battery acid line it's leaking inside

18:33.170 --> 18:38.300
and vaporize poison what's left of their

18:35.240 --> 18:44.400
you all right yeah yeah let's just get

18:38.299 --> 18:47.339
the start right

18:44.400 --> 18:49.290
we can jerry-rig accomplice external

18:47.339 --> 18:51.149
connected using a backup regulator and

18:49.289 --> 18:53.279
split up a couple tanks and feet onto

18:51.150 --> 18:54.930
directly into this up okay turn around

18:53.279 --> 18:57.569
I'll disconnect the tank from each of

18:54.930 --> 18:59.640
you i should do this

18:57.569 --> 19:02.189
no you should give me your tank Gordon

18:59.640 --> 19:04.620
service Sean I know more about this kind

19:02.190 --> 19:09.000
of thing you do spend more time of death

19:04.619 --> 19:10.619
to simple process one-man job what these

19:09.000 --> 19:13.950
texts provide enough to educate them

19:10.619 --> 19:18.000
going to help arrives they should turn

19:13.950 --> 19:20.670
around

19:18.000 --> 19:26.659
are you gonna do this without tools I

19:20.670 --> 19:29.899
have everything I need

19:26.659 --> 19:31.759
Nick you jerry-rigged that tank i'll

19:29.898 --> 19:37.429
check inside

19:31.759 --> 19:42.769
Roger

19:37.430 --> 19:51.140
she

19:42.769 --> 19:57.440
try to take off or you move more air use

19:51.140 --> 20:04.000
that we gotta hurry showing signs of

19:57.440 --> 20:07.840
oxygen deprivation help

20:04.000 --> 20:12.279
you both got to leave now you won't have

20:07.839 --> 20:23.559
compared to compress

20:12.279 --> 20:28.629
oh ok Ali greenie compression stops to

20:23.559 --> 20:30.129
make one minute for each offense gam the

20:28.630 --> 20:32.410
connection of the regulator broke this

20:30.130 --> 20:35.740
takes useless i gotta start over again
