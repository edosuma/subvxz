<i>Eat ice cream. Ride my bike.</i>

01:34.400 --> 01:36.710

01:37.320 --> 01:41.473
<i>I love Minecraft, science

01:47.280 --> 01:48.793

<i>And dream about being in outer space,
just like any ordinary kid.</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:58.153
<i>I just don't look ordinary
when I'm doing these things.</i>

01:59.320 --> 02:01.277

02:03.360 --> 02:04.350
<i>It was...</i>

02:04.960 --> 02:05.995
<i>hilarious.</i>

02:06.520 --> 02:09.160
<i>Now, how can a birth be hilarious,
you ask?</i>

02:09.240 --> 02:10.799

- Go with the baby.

<i>[boy] I've had 27 surgeries since then.</i>

<i>But none of them
have made me look ordinary.</i>

03:02.880 --> 03:05.190
[Nate] He said he doesn't want to go.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.435
But he's ready.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.794
[Nate] No, he's not ready.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.951
I cannot home school him forever.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.914
[mother] Every year that we wait,
it'll just be harder to start.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.914
This is the first year of middle school
for everyone.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.991
He will not be the only new kid.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.671
[Nate] Okay, well, he's gonna be the only
new kid that looks like him.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.839
Look, will you stop folding towels
for just one second and please listen?

03:24.920 --> 03:27.150
It's like leading a lamb
to the slaughter...

03:27.440 --> 03:28.430
and you know it.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.796
[boy] <i>I know I'll never

03:34.200 --> 03:37.431
<i>Ordinary kids don't make other kids

<i>Ordinary kids don't get stared

<i>But it's okay if you wanna stare too.</i>

03:57.400 --> 03:58.674
<i>My name is Auggie Pullman.</i>

03:59.440 --> 04:01.750
<i>Next week, I start fifth grade.</i>

04:03.560 --> 04:06.154
<i>And since I've never been
to real school before...</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:11.039
<i>I'm pretty much totally
and completely petrified.</i>

[upbeat music continues]

04:46.280 --> 04:47.270
[sighs]

04:51.120 --> 04:53.919
Mrs. Pullman, so good to see you again.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.674
And you must be Auggie.
What a pleasure to meet you.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.230
I'm Mr. Tushman.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.836
You can laugh about that. Tushman.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.390
I've heard them all.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.149
- Tushy. Butt man. Butt face.
-[mother chuckles] Oh.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.390
Mr. Tukus.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.677
-[Auggie snorts]
-[Tushman laughs]

05:11.760 --> 05:14.991
[Mr. Tushman] And then in the spring,
we have a science fair.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.514
And from what your home school teacher
tells me, you'll get first prize.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.030
You hear that, Auggie?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.469
Then right before graduation,
whole class takes a trip

05:25.080 --> 05:27.230
to a nature reserve in Pennsylvania.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.153
It is the highlight of the year.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.393
- I promise you.
-[kids chattering]

05:32.480 --> 05:33.390
Oh good, they're here.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.119
Um... who are they?

05:44.560 --> 05:47.074
I thought it would be helpful for you
to meet some of our students

05:47.200 --> 05:49.999
before you start school, Auggie.
What do you think?

05:51.880 --> 05:53.234
Other kids now?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.080
[Mr. Tushman] They were in the elementary
school so they know their way around...

05:56.360 --> 05:57.475
and they'll give you a nice tour.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.395
It will be fine.

06:08.080 --> 06:12.119
[Mr. Tushman] Auggie, this is Jack Will,
Julian, and Charlotte.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.199
Guys, this is Auggie Pullman.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.077
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.910
Hey.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.830
<i>[Auggie] Meeting kids is harder
than meeting adults.</i>

06:24.360 --> 06:26.590
<i>Everyone makes the same face at first...</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:29.515
<i>but kids aren't as good at hiding it.</i>

06:30.920 --> 06:32.831
<i>So I usually look down.</i>

06:34.160 --> 06:36.390
<i>You can learn a lot
about people from their shoes.</i>

06:36.880 --> 06:38.200
<i>I think these three are:</i>

06:39.200 --> 06:40.554
<i>trust fund kid,</i>

06:41.680 --> 06:42.909
<i>hand-me-down kid...</i>

06:44.000 --> 06:45.513
<i>Uh-oh, crazy kid.</i>

06:46.080 --> 06:47.593
I act in TV commercials.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.150
Really?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.471
Yeah. Tide.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.630
[Mr. Tushman] Why don't you guys
take Auggie around the school a bit, huh?

06:55.880 --> 06:58.554
Just be back here in, um, a half hour?

07:05.840 --> 07:07.399
[whimsical music begins playing]

07:11.760 --> 07:14.320
[Charlotte] I started when I was two.
Local spots mostly.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.592
Then, when I was three, I booked
my first national. Nestle Quik.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.671
It was hard, because
I'm lactose intolerant.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.390
Anyway, have you ever heard
of a spit bucket?

07:22.480 --> 07:25.438
So this is our homeroom.
We have Mr. Browne.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.793
My mom says he's a little weird.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.159
[Charlotte] Then I was in the chorus

07:31.240 --> 07:35.677
<i>of the Radio City</i> Music Hall
<i>Christmas Spectacular.</i>

07:35.920 --> 07:37.752
I auditioned for <i>Annie</i> on Broadway.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.390
I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess
they went in a different direction.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.430
Hey, Charlotte?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.034
Don't you ever stop talking?

07:46.520 --> 07:48.477
So this is the cafeteria.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.878
The food here is okay for school food.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.318
Or do you eat special food?

08:06.240 --> 08:09.870
[Charlotte] Wow! This reminds me
of my guess spot on Law <i>&</i> Order.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.238
So, the science elective
is supposably really hard.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.158
So you probably won't be
spending much time here.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.230
No offense, but if you've never
been in a real school before...

08:19.720 --> 08:21.233
Dude, he's been home schooled.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.830
Okay, I'm just saying.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.112
Science is supposably really hard.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.189
But you're taking it, too, right?

08:28.120 --> 08:29.758
[chuckles] Hey, maybe you could
fail together.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.434
Why don't you get out of the way,
so he can check it out?

08:35.240 --> 08:36.150
Okay-

08:38.120 --> 08:41.158
I mean, there's nothing much to see.
Desks. Chairs.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.397
The incubator. Bunsen burners.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.517
Those are some
really gross science posters.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.036
Oh! And this is an eraser.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.273
[Charlotte] He knows what an eraser is.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.313
How am I supposed to know what he knows?
He doesn't say anything.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.118
You know what an eraser is, right?

08:57.960 --> 09:00.600
[whispers] Dude, you have
to say something.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.878
Yeah, I know what an eraser is.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.991
Is-- is your name Jack or Jack Will?

09:10.520 --> 09:12.591
[giggles] Wait, you thought his name
was Jack Will?

09:12.880 --> 09:16.191
Yeah, a lot of people call me
by my first and last name.

09:17.040 --> 09:17.950
I don't know why.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.755
Got any other questions?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.877
Actually, I've got a question for Auggie.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.351
- What's the deal with your face?
- Dude!

09:25.560 --> 09:27.153
I mean, were you
in a car crash or something?

09:27.240 --> 09:28.389
- Julian!
- What?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.835
Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.470
Not rude questions. Besides, he was born
like that, Mr. Tushman said.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.996
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe he was,
like, in a fire, too.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.878
Hey, Julian, shut up.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.077
- You shut up!
- Why don't we all shut up?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.758
No, I wasn't in a fire.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.353
And the word's "supposedly."

09:52.360 --> 09:53.236
What?

09:53.600 --> 09:57.309
You said that science
is "supposably really hard."

09:57.680 --> 09:58.670
Twice.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.519
The word's "supposedly." With a

10:05.360 --> 10:07.590
Maybe my mom can home school you, too.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.511
[whimsical music playing]

10:21.280 --> 10:26.150
Do you wanna tell us yet
how you felt about the tour today?

10:26.240 --> 10:29.551
Mr. Tushman went out of his way
to tell me how sweet those kids were

10:29.640 --> 10:32.758
and that Julian
is apparently quite the dream.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.074
[sighs] No.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.150
[mother] Not a dream?

10:36.440 --> 10:39.319
Is he one of those kids that acts one way
in front of grownups

10:39.400 --> 10:41.277
and then another way in front of kids?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.199
Yeah, I guess.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.160
Well, I know it's hard,
but you have to understand that

10:47.240 --> 10:49.675
he probably feels badly about himself.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.675
And when someone acts small, you just
have to be the bigger person, all right?

10:53.760 --> 10:55.398
- Right.
- Right.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.520
[mother] Via, I'll get the pizza.
Can you get the trivet?

11:00.600 --> 11:01.749
[whispers] Look at me, Auggie.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.992
That kid sounds like a real jerk.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.230
If somebody pushes you, you push back.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.879
Don't be afraid of anyone.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.075
[whispers] Why are we whispering?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.680
Because I'm afraid of Mom.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.989
You just gotta be a bigger person
and rise above it. It's that easy.

11:17.880 --> 11:22.078
Auggie, I do believe that this is the best
year for you to start school

11:22.200 --> 11:24.476
because everybody is going to be new.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.273
- But if you really don't wanna go--
- No. It's okay. I wanna go.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.190
You do?

11:34.320 --> 11:36.277
-[Auggie] Mm-hmm.
-[mother] What changed your mind?

11:37.200 --> 11:39.350
Well they have a really good
science elective.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.233
And I need a better science teacher.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.194
[Nate] Oh! [chuckles]

11:44.280 --> 11:46.590
- Oh, wow. There's that.
-[Nate] Whoa! Whoa!

11:46.680 --> 11:48.079
Are you gonna take that, Mom?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.720
Can I get some backup here? You gonna
let him talk to your wife like this?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.950
[Nate] I'm not gonna let him
talk to my wife like that. [roars]

11:53.040 --> 11:54.314
-[Auggie] Please!
-[Nate] Get him. Come on, Via.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.716
Get in there. Get in there. Get in there.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.756
[Auggie laughing and screaming]

11:57.840 --> 11:59.831
[upbeat music playing]

12:09.920 --> 12:11.957
[water flowing, birds chirping]

12:18.520 --> 12:19.430
[indistinct children's chatter]

12:25.360 --> 12:27.920
I'll meet you right here after school.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.640
Okay? Right here.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.273
-[mother whispers] I love you.
-[Auggie] Love you, too.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.830
I'll see you later.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.710
Can you hear me?

12:48.240 --> 12:49.230
[indistinct whispering]

12:52.280 --> 12:53.998
We're gonna have a little man-to-man.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.878
Now, I gotta stop here, because past this
point is a "No Dad Zone"

12:58.960 --> 13:01.600
and you don't wanna walk up
with your parents because it's not cool.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.511
'[AU99i9] But you're cool.
-[Nate sighs]

13:05.040 --> 13:09.034
I know I am, but technically
most dads aren't, so...

13:10.040 --> 13:11.553
And neither are these helmets.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.316
Hey.

13:16.720 --> 13:21.317
Two rules.
First, only raise your hand once a class,

13:21.400 --> 13:22.799
no matter how many answers you know.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.079
Except for science. Crush them all.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.230
Check.

13:27.520 --> 13:32.151
Second... you're gonna feel like
you're all alone, Auggie, but you're not.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.510
Check.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.950
Should we lose this? Come on,
costumes are for Halloween.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.669
Prepare for blastoff.

13:50.960 --> 13:51.950
I love you.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.150
I love you, too.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.953
-[Nate] Have fun.
-[Auggie] Bye.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.317
<i>[woman, on radio]
Have an excellent mission and Godspeed.</i>

14:02.960 --> 14:04.712
<i>[man, on radio]
We are ready to proceed at this time.</i>

14:05.720 --> 14:09.190
[woman, on radio] 10, 9, 8, <i>7...</i>

14:09.280 --> 14:11.191
Dear God, please,
make them be nice to him.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.390
[woman, on radio] ...4, 3, 2, 1.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.274
[rocket blasting off]

14:24.360 --> 14:25.555
<i>[Auggie] My mom always said...</i>

14:26.680 --> 14:28.239
<i>"if you don't like where you are...</i>

14:28.720 --> 14:30.472
<i>just picture where you wanna be."</i>

14:35.560 --> 14:38.074
<i>[all, chanting] Auggie! Auggie!</i>

14:38.280 --> 14:41.033
<i>AUQQie! Auggie!</i>

14:42.200 --> 14:43.599
[chanting continues]

14:47.760 --> 14:48.750
[locker slams shut]

14:51.760 --> 14:54.593
<i>[Auggie sighs]
I can't wait till Halloween.</i>

15:03.000 --> 15:03.990
[all chattering]

15:15.480 --> 15:17.118
All right, let's settle down.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.915
Everybody settle down.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.877
Uh... Saved.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.230
Sorry.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.234
[Mr. Browne]
Everybody find your seats? Yes?

15:28.640 --> 15:30.472
Finding our seats. Great.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.231
[bell rings]

15:35.280 --> 15:39.069
All right, now some of us are lucky
enough to know each other. Yeah?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.071
And-- and others are new. Hi there.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.110
Okay-

15:43.760 --> 15:45.956
My name is Mr. Browne.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.389
And you're late.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.635
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.719
I was just helping set up
chairs for the assembly.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.713
Don't worry about it.
Can anybody tell me what this word means?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.520
Anybody? No?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.592
Precepts are rules
for really important things.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.670
Like mottos.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.354
Like mottos or like famous quotes.

16:06.440 --> 16:10.274
Or like, um, lines
from a fortune cookie. Right?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.954
Precepts can help motivate us.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.951
They can guide us when
we have to make decisions

16:15.040 --> 16:16.269
about really important things.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.271
"Okay, so why are you talking to me
about precepts

16:18.360 --> 16:19.634
this early in the morning, Mr. Browne?"

16:19.720 --> 16:20.869
Well, let me tell you.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.197
Because precepts also can
tell us a lot about ourselves.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.757
"Who is it that I aspire to be?"

16:26.880 --> 16:29.520
That is the question that we should
be asking ourselves all the time.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.557
"What kind of person am I?"

16:32.000 --> 16:33.320
So this is what we're gonna do.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.914
Um, everyone's gonna come up
with two things...

16:36.320 --> 16:38.596
that they think everybody else
should know about them.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.829
All right? I'll go first.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.629
Number one, I used to work on Wall Street.
For a long time.

16:43.720 --> 16:48.556
And two, I left Wall Street
to pursue my dream and teach.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.789
Boom! Who's next?

16:51.560 --> 16:52.550
Yes.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.795
Julian Albans.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.440
And I think it's cool how
you're pursuing your dream.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.474
Thank you very much, Julian.
Let's hear your two things.

17:00.960 --> 17:01.950
Okay-

17:02.400 --> 17:06.439
<i>One,</i> I <i>just got Battleground Mystic
on</i> my Wii and <i>it's totally awesome.</i>

17:06.760 --> 17:10.230
And number two, we got
a ping pong table this summer.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.077
Amazing. Any questions for Julian?

17:13.760 --> 17:14.636
Yes?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.872
<i>Is Battleground Mystic
multiplayer or single player?</i>

17:17.960 --> 17:19.678
Let's-- Not those kinda questions.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.590
[afllaugh]

17:20.680 --> 17:23.273
Okay, uh...

17:28.160 --> 17:29.275
[deep breath]

17:29.400 --> 17:30.754
[sighs]

17:34.480 --> 17:38.474
Hi. My name's August Pullman.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.550
IIAuggie-II

17:40.440 --> 17:41.794
And, um...

17:42.960 --> 17:46.191
I have a sister named Via
and a dog named Daisy.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.554
<i>I love Star Wars.</i>

17:49.640 --> 17:51.074
And I just said three things.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.399
Yeah. Sorry.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.551
Well, that sounds like a bonus
to me. Three things.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.280
Thank you very much, Auggie,
that was perfect. Who's next?

17:59.360 --> 18:02.113
Oh! I actually have a question for Auggie.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.351
What's the deal with the braid
in the back of your hair?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.234
Is it like a Padawan thing?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.200
What's a Padawan thing?

18:09.640 --> 18:13.235
Oh. It's from Star Wars.
Padawan is a Jedi apprentice.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.709
Who's your favorite character, Auggie?

18:16.800 --> 18:17.790
<i>Boba Fe“.</i>

18:18.360 --> 18:20.510
What about Darth Sidious? Do you like him?

18:25.520 --> 18:26.510
Ouch.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.436
Okay, can we talk about
Star Wars at recess? Yes?

18:30.800 --> 18:33.599
All right. Who wants to read
this month's precept?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.557
[all] Me! Me! Me!

18:39.120 --> 18:40.440
What about you? What's your name?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.874
- Summer.
-[Mr. Browne] Summer.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.750
Wanna give it a shot?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.755
"When given the choice between
being right or being kind...

18:52.240 --> 18:53.230
choose kind."

18:53.920 --> 18:56.389
[bell ringing]

19:32.960 --> 19:34.109
[Julian] Hey, can I sit there?

19:34.440 --> 19:35.430
Sure.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.435
You eat like the Sarlacc monster,
my young Padawan.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.230
[chuckfing]

19:49.080 --> 19:52.755
Newton's first law of motion.

19:55.040 --> 19:59.637
An object in motion
will stay in motion unless...

20:02.080 --> 20:04.151
It's okay, I didn't expect you
to know that on the first day.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.634
Acted on by another force.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.078
Acted on by another force.

20:10.840 --> 20:11.830
Very good.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.595
Here's how it works.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.913
<i>A moving object will only change
its speed or direction...</i>

20:19.920 --> 20:22.389
<i>if something else causes it to do that.</i>

20:36.920 --> 20:38.513
Hey Darth Hideous, did you hear?

20:38.920 --> 20:40.672
Padawan braids were lame 15 years ago.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.874
Supposedly. With a

20:43.280 --> 20:45.635
- Dude!
- More like they were always lame.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.755
[Julian chuckles] See you tomorrow.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.635
[boy] Later, Barf Hideous.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.674
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.670
[door opens]

21:05.240 --> 21:06.389
Auggie, you're supposed to knock.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.989
I'm serious this time.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.114
Wait, did someone make fun of it?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.834
[Nate sighs]

21:32.440 --> 21:34.033
I, for one, had a great day.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.880
Just trying to lighten the mood.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.680
Right, Daisy? Right. Good girl.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.799
Well I went to, um, Kinko's today

21:50.200 --> 21:53.238
to see if they could get
my thesis off this.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.719
You're gonna finish your dissertation?

21:57.320 --> 21:59.675
-[Via] What is that?
- It's a floppy disk.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.591
A What?

22:00.680 --> 22:02.557
[Nate] Come on! You-- It-- A floppy...

22:03.160 --> 22:06.198
These kids today.
It's basically an iPhone.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.120
You know, it doesn't play music
or, you can't call, but...

22:09.360 --> 22:10.475
They couldn't get the file.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.678
That's okay. You'll find a place.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.430
Well, I think it's great, Mom.

22:15.800 --> 22:16.870
Maybe. Thank you.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.755
So Auggie...

22:26.800 --> 22:27.790
[Allggie] Yeah?

22:32.680 --> 22:33.590
Hi.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.999
How was your first day of school?

22:45.640 --> 22:48.598
Earth to Auggie. We asked you a question.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.757
- Come on, how was your day?
- Good.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.231
Good how? "Good," like it was good?

22:55.320 --> 22:57.755
Or "good," like it was bad and
you just don't wanna tell us?

22:57.840 --> 23:00.673
It was good, okay? I just don't know
what you want me to say! It was good!

23:00.760 --> 23:04.833
Okay, hey! If you're mad at Mom about
going to school, it was my idea, too.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.752
Why can't I just say "good"
like anybody else?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.918
Batting a thousand today.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.714
Are they gonna ask about my day?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.830
That is not the way we leave the table.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.876
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.390
Sit down.

23:54.960 --> 23:55.995
Take that off, please.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.713
-[voice breaking] I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.680
It'll be okay.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.277
Why do I have to be so ugly?

24:12.760 --> 24:14.831
You are not ugly, Auggie.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.075
You just have to say that
because you're my mom.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.910
Oh, because I'm your mom,
it doesn't count?

24:21.640 --> 24:22.471
Yeah.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.599
Because I'm your mom, it counts the most
because I know you the most.

24:27.120 --> 24:32.240
You are not ugly and anyone
who cares to know you will see that.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.592
They won't even talk to me.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.152
It matters that I look different.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.679
I try to pretend that it doesn't,
but it does.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.390
I know.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.079
Is it always gonna matter?

24:50.800 --> 24:51.835
[softly] I don't know.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.430
[Auggie sobbing]

24:57.080 --> 24:58.070
Oh, honey.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.590
Listen...

25:03.560 --> 25:07.679
Look at me. We all...
have marks on our face.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.475
I have this wrinkle here
from your first surgery...

25:11.840 --> 25:15.037
and have these wrinkles here
from your last surgery.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.351
This is the map...
that shows us where we're going.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.591
And this is the map...
that shows us where we've been.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.670
[softly] And it's never... ever ugly.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.630
[whimpers]

25:31.720 --> 25:33.199
But what about your gray hair?

25:34.280 --> 25:35.270
[chuckling softly]

25:39.080 --> 25:41.117
That's compliments of your dad, I think.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.190
[chuckfing]

25:54.680 --> 25:56.512
And as though we summoned him.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.510
[Auggie] HOW Was your day?

25:59.520 --> 26:04.037
My day is really good right now.

26:08.280 --> 26:13.912
[Nate] So they went to Florida,
where Gollum was living in Miami.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.511
And...

26:15.600 --> 26:18.319
Oh, you know what it is?
Daddy doesn't have his glasses on.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.629
You're making this up.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.994
[all laughing]

26:28.520 --> 26:30.511
[water flowing, indistinct chatter]

26:33.920 --> 26:35.274
<i>[Via] August is the sun.</i>

26:36.880 --> 26:39.679
<i>My mom and dad and me
are planets orbiting the sun.</i>

26:41.160 --> 26:44.551
<i>But I love my brother and I'm used
to the way this universe works.</i>

26:49.640 --> 26:51.711
<i>My mom says that on my fourth birthday...</i>

26:52.600 --> 26:53.874
<i>I wished for a little brother.</i>

26:54.440 --> 27:00.277
<i>And when he was born, it only took me
a few seconds and I was all over him.</i>

27:02.840 --> 27:03.830
Can you hear me?

27:05.080 --> 27:07.515
If they stare, let them stare.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.029
You can't blend in
when you were born to stand out.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.149
<i>I've never asked my mom
for help with my homework.</i>

27:19.160 --> 27:22.073
<i>I never needed my dad to remind me
to study for a test.</i>

27:22.920 --> 27:25.833
<i>I just did most of my studying
in waiting rooms and hospitals.</i>

27:26.680 --> 27:30.435
<i>Mom and Dad would always say I was
the most understanding girl in the world.</i>

27:32.120 --> 27:33.269
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

27:34.560 --> 27:37.074
<i>I just knew my family
couldn't take one more thing.</i>

27:38.560 --> 27:42.076
<i>I know my family loves me,
but ever since my grandma died,</i>

27:42.560 --> 27:45.359
<i>my best friend Miranda is the only person
who knows me.</i>

27:47.400 --> 27:48.390
Miranda!

27:50.160 --> 27:52.276
Wow. Look at you.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.276
Hey, Via.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.431
I've texted you, like, 1000 times.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.794
When'd you get back from camp?

27:59.040 --> 27:59.996
Two weeks ago.

28:02.080 --> 28:02.956
Two weeks?

28:03.040 --> 28:05.634
Sorry, it's been crazy. You know?

28:06.640 --> 28:07.960
Yeah, no, that's okay.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.669
What'd you do to your hair?

28:12.400 --> 28:13.310
Do you like it?

28:13.600 --> 28:14.874
Yeah. Yeah.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.438
It looks wild.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.190
Just trying something different, you know?

28:21.640 --> 28:22.630
I'll catch you later.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.912
- Hey, Ella.
-[Ella] Hey.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.390
[indistinct chatter]

28:43.280 --> 28:44.270
[chatter from students continues]

28:47.240 --> 28:48.230
[sighs]

28:56.720 --> 28:57.869
Thinking about signing up?

29:00.080 --> 29:01.354
- For what?
- The Drama Club.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.717
They study theater in the fall
and do a play in the spring.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.079

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.554
Something more important to think about?

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.149
No.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.152
So, it'll be teams of two.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.517
Your partner will be your tablemate.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.795
[Julian] Uh, Ms. Petosa?

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.751
I know we're supposed to be in pairs,
but...

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.911
Jack, Amos, and I had
this science fair project idea

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.319
that we wanted to work on together.

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.152
-[Ms. Petosa] Okay, maybe we can switch--
- Uh,no.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.032
- Sorry?
- W hat?

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.238
No, um, it's-- it's okay.
I'll stay with who I've got.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.434
I'll stick with Auggie.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.069
Hey! What did you do that for?

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.719
Dude, I don't want to switch.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.837
Why not? Do you really wanna
be partners with that freak?

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.550
[grunting]

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:11.910
<i>[Jack] Dear Mr. Tushman,
I am very sorry for punching Julian.</i>

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.118
<i>It was wrong of me to do that.</i>

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.518
<i>I know you may need to expel me,</i>

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.399
<i>but I'd still rather not say...</i>

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:22.033
<i>Why I did What I did.</i>

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.790
<i>It might get Julian in trouble too</i>

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.673
<i>-and that's not fair.
- Stop!</i>

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.710
<i>Sincerely, Jack Will.</i>

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.634
<i>[Mr. Tushman] Dear Mr. Will...</i>

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.599
<i>one thing I've learned in 20 years
in education</i>

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.319
<i>is that there are two sides
to every story.</i>

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:44.750
<i>So I think I can imagine
what started the fight.</i>

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.158
<i>While nothing justifies
striking another student...</i>

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.990
<i>I know good friends are worth defending.</i>

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.239
<i>So, after your two-day suspension...</i>

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.192
<i>your scholarship will be waiting for you.</i>

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.075
I thought we were friends.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.559
<i>[Mr. Tushman] Just keep up the good work.</i>

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.389
<i>And keep being the fine boy
we all know you to be.</i>

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.392
<i>Sincerely, Mr. Tushman.</i>

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.794
[Via] What's so wrong with me
not telling you about a stupid play?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.030
I'm not even in it,
I'm just doing the lights.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.112
Well, your boyfriend is and don't
you think we would like to see him?

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.874
- No, I don't.
- Look, let's all calm down for a second.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.394
You know, you've been really good

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.879
at leaving me alone my whole life.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.311
So why are you suddenly
so interested, huh?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.914
Are you-- Are you bored
now that Auggie's in school?

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.798
Your thesis not going well?

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.713
Nate, could you please excuse us?

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.120
-Izzy, she doesn't mean--
- Nate!

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.349
[Isabel arguing indistinctly]

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.880
What are they saying down there?

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.118
[Nate] They, my friend,
are saying a lotta things.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.038
None of which concern us.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.319
Let's see your new Minecraft world,

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.638
'cause we might be moving to it.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.238
So, are we going to see the play?

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.354
Um... I hadn't realized what the play was

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.751
and I don't think it will be of any
interest to a kid your age.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.714
Yeah, uh, you'd-- you'd get totally bored.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.874
[Auggie] Are you and Dad going?

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.554
Daddy will go
and I'm gonna stay here with you.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.150
What?

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.996
So now you're gonna punish me
by not going?

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.990
Well, you didn't want me to go
in the first place, remember?

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.874
Well, now that you know about it,
of course I want you to come.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.354
What are you talking about?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.396
- Nothing.
-[Via] Nothing.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.070
You're lying.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.795
It's just something to do
with Via's school, honey.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.270
You just don't want your
fancy high school friends

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.680
to know your brother's a freak, huh?

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.478
-[lsabel] Auggie!
- Auggie, that's not true.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.473
Stop lying to me. I'm not an idiot,
I know what's going on!

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.795
[Daisy whimpering]

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.830
Daisy girl?

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.751
Auggie. Come on.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.675
[Auggie] It's okay, I don't wanna go
to your stupid high school anyway.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.591
I don't care.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.990
Auggie, not everything
in the world is about you.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.550
[Via sniffles]

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.030
What's wrong?

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.598
[Daisy whimpering]

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.550
[Daisy's whimpering continues]

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.160
You're gonna be fine, girlie.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.709
Daddy's gonna meet me there.
Take care of your brother.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.192
-[Via] Yeah.
- Okay. All right. [sniffles]

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.799
Did Daisy really bite Mom?

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.591
Well, um... she was whimpering.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.792
And then Mom tried to pick her up
and Daisy bit her.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.513
Do you think the vet can fix her?

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.231
[softly] She was in a lot of pain, Auggie.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.949
She's really old.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.750
Auggie?

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.594
I want you to come to my play. Okay?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.476
Really?

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.710
Really.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.870
[door opening]

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.796
[somber music playing]

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.430
[sniffles]

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.598
[heavy breathing]

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.869
[sniffles]

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.037
<i>[Auggie] Every time I came home
from the hospital, Daisy was here.</i>

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.113
<i>She was a real friend.</i>

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.910
<i>And real friends... are hard to find.</i>

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.030
[blip]

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.271
[joyous music playing]

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.950
Paughs]

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.391
[joyous music continues]

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.199
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.590
Thank you.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.715
This is perfect.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.711
Here we go. Good seats.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.916
See if you can find
Via's name in there, honey.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.030
Glasses. Oh, no! [gasps]
I think I forgot my glasses.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.872
Auggie, you're missing a great episode
of Hoarders, right here.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.992
-[chuckles]
- Starring your mom's purse.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.355
You ready?

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.192
Are you supposed to be
in the girls' dressing room?

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.880
Just wanted to wish you good luck.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.954
"Break a leg," not “good luck."

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.470
You too.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.149
Anyone cheering you on tonight?

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.193
Uh, yeah...

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.278
my mom invited the entire block.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.395
[chuckles]

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.800
It's gonna be really embarrassing.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.359
[both chuckle]

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.350
YOU?

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.833
Uh, my dad is on his belated honeymoon

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.479
and my mom's in a funk,

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.551
but maybe she'll come tomorrow.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.274
Well, um, Via's family will cheer you on.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.510
You'll be great tonight.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.751
- Honey, just enjoy the play.
- Okay.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.790
All right, go get them.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.755
- Mr. Davenport...
- Hmm?

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.797
I'm really sorry,
but I can't go on tonight.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.553
I don't feel well.
I think I might throw up.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.916
Okay, everybody gets nervous.
You know, when I did my Hamlet,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.798
I threw up every night.
You're gonna be fine.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.791
Just do it.
You'll have of spring break to recover.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.871
Mr. Davenport, you're not listening.
I'm not going on.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.555
Are you kidding me?

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.920
I'm really sorry, but Via knows
all the lines. She can do it.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.273
Then go find her then.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.590
Thank you.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:56.870
[exhales]

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.033
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.111
[all applauding]

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.950
This play is called Our <i>Town.</i>

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.597
It was written by Thornton Wilder.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.959
The name of our town
is Grover's Corners, New Hampshire.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.116
Just across the Massachusetts line.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.520
Is this-- Is this really happening?

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.240
Yes, you're going on as Emily.
Only we don't have much time.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.789
Well, I don't even know
if I'm gonna remember all of my lines.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.473
You'll be great.
Justin will help you through it.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.516
[Mr. Davenport] Where is she?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.833
Via, you're on in two minutes.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.714
Why-- why are you doing this?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.111
- I told you... I feel sick.
- Okay.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.030
We've got a factory in our town too.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.110
You hear it?

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.954
- Hey, it's okay.
-[Justin] Makes blankets.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.556
Hey, break a leg.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.069
[Justin] Cartwrights own it
and it brung them a fortune.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.318
[girl] Children, now I won't have it.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.397
Breakfast is just as good
as any other meal

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.797
and I won't have you gobbling like wolves.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.518
It'll stunt your growth. That's a fact.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.673
[whispers] Miranda looks so different.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.037
[whispers] That's not Miranda, that's Via.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.438
- What?
- It's Via.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.670
Oh, great.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.511
[girl] As for me, I'd rather have
my children healthy than bright.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.191
I'm both, Mama, you know I am.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.391
I'm the brightest girl in school
for my age.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.039
I have a wonderful memory.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.994
[girl] Eat your breakfast.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.112
[play continues indistinctly]

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.474
Hmm. Your stomach flu got better fast.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.118
Sorry, sir, just jitters.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.589
I'll be ready by tomorrow night.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.994
She's doing very well.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.750
I can't...

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.229
I can't go on.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.558
It-- It goes so fast.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.511
We don't even have time
to look at one another.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.349
I didn't realize.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.393
So all that was going on
and we never noticed?

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.713
Take me back... up the hill...
to my grave.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.310
But first...

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.234
wait... one more look.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.830
Goodbye... Goodbye, world.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.152
Goodbye, Grover's Corners.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.710
Mama...

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.955
and Papa.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.193
Goodbye to clocks ticking.

if you need help you can ask for it.

You're not alone.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:11.590

You know something about this.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.870
[Mr. Tushman] You understand?

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.196
We take bullying very seriously
at this school.

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.079
There's zero tolerance.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.672
Excuse me, can you explain
what's going on here?

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.076
Wasn't Julian the one
who got punched in the mouth?

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.390
If there's any bullying
going on, it isn't my son.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.715
[Julian's dad] You wrote that, Julian?

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.870
Yes, sir.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.232
That one note was on the back
of a class photo.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.991
Your son photoshopped Auggie out of it.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.589
No. No, he didn't. I did.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.631
Of course, I didn't think that
he would bring it to school.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.951
But when our friends come over
and they see that picture,

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.395
I want them to ask about our son,
not the Pullmans'.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.630
[Mr. Tushman] Mrs. Albans.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.880
When we pressed Auggie,
he showed us these other notes...

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.073
that your son left
in his locker and in his desk and...

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.595
his chair.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.471
Okay, if no one else is gonna have the
courage to say it, then I guess I will.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.315
These kids are too young to be dealing
with this sort of thing.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.756
Julian has had nightmares
because of that kid.

01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.875
- Sarah.
- Did you know that?

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.951
We had to take him to a child psychologist

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.872
to help him deal with his night terrors.

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.394
It's just a two-day suspension.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.794
You'll stay home from the nature

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.516

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.390
After all the money that we have poured
into this school?

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.156
We have a lot of friends on
the school board, Mr. Tushman.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.430
Oh. [sighs]

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.597
[exhales] Well, I have more.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.554
[Sarah] So what would you have us do?

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.717

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.958
[chuckles] You are not doing
these kids any favors.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:38.954
[sighs] Mrs. Albans, Auggie
can't change the way he looks.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:44.357
So, maybe we can change the way we see.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.395
Yes. I will be sure to tell that
to the real world.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.149
