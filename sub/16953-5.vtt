Texas, we get the bad
rep that we... we are

20:30.168 --> 20:31.646
not compassionate.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.107
And I think that's
a wrong portrayal.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.776
Texans, as a whole,
when the crisis come,

20:36.777 --> 20:39.343
are the most generous and the
most compassionate people

20:39.344 --> 20:40.197
that I know.

It doesn't matter if

When... when that time come,
they are very generous,

20:46.037 --> 20:48.414
and they... they will help out.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.672
It's hot in Houston, so
things move a little

20:55.673 --> 20:57.130

"Never eat anything

26:07.274 --> 26:09.859
Syrup is promethazine
and codeine.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.027

with soda out here.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.948
Why is that the drug
of choice here?

26:15.949 --> 26:17.658

26:56.782 --> 26:58.450

greatest out here,

26:58.451 --> 27:00.785

27:00.786 --> 27:02.912

27:28.688 --> 27:31.816
to the town of Palacios
on the Matagorda Bay.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.737
And like a lot of the communities
down here, the principal

27:34.738 --> 27:37.654
industry is fishing,
shrimp in particular.

27:37.655 --> 27:40.116
It's also where,
beginning in the 1970s,

27:40.117 --> 27:43.369
as the Vietnam War ground to
its ignominious conclusion,

27:43.370 --> 27:47.957
the thousands of Vietnamese
found new lives and a new home.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.107
To have remained would have
meant, in most cases, arrest,

27:51.108 --> 27:55.381
imprisonment, reeducation
camps, or worse.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.592
So all you want is
shrimp at this point.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.178
Yeah.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.660
I got shrimp and fish.

28:01.661 --> 28:03.139
But I got enough fish.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.287
Shrimp, you take.

28:04.288 --> 28:05.433
Yup, yup. Big shrimp.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.727
- The small, we don't get the shrimp.
- You don't want it.

28:07.730 --> 28:08.685
No, I don't want to.

28:08.686 --> 28:11.981
The shrimping has declined
considerably since the 1980s,

28:11.982 --> 28:14.609
but the bay still provides
a solid livelihood

28:14.610 --> 28:17.925
for people like Vin Nguyen,
who made it out of Vietnam

28:17.926 --> 28:19.780
on a tiny handmade boat.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.033
His engine died, and he
and his family were lost

28:22.034 --> 28:25.934
in the South China Sea for
nine days before being rescued

28:25.935 --> 28:27.372
by a cargo ship.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.291
He became a United
States citizen in 1990

28:30.292 --> 28:32.918
and raised his family
here in Palacios.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.462
So what year did you come here?

28:34.463 --> 28:36.047
How long have you
been doing this?

28:36.048 --> 28:40.218
I have been... I start
for shrimp on 1985.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.470
And what year did you
arrive in this country?

28:42.471 --> 28:44.472
I left my country 1979.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.391
How old were you
when you got here?

28:46.392 --> 28:47.539
21-year-old.

28:47.540 --> 28:48.686
You were 21.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.685
So why shrimp?

28:48.686 --> 28:50.436
How did you come
to this business?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.523
- Because my... my... my cousin.
- Cousin, okay.

28:52.526 --> 28:54.024
- He was living here.
- Right.

28:54.027 --> 28:55.900
And I work on a job first.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.862
But he told me... my cousin
told me that it's very good

28:58.863 --> 28:59.737
for shrimping.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.468
Good for shrimp.

In my experience, I
moved from Singapore.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.309
Right.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.433
First six months, whenever
we used to go anywhere

39:13.434 --> 39:16.229
and say we recently moved
to USA, and everybody go,

39:16.230 --> 39:17.021
"Welcome to Texas."

39:17.022 --> 39:18.252
Welcome to Houston.

39:18.253 --> 39:19.481
"Welcome to USA."

39:19.482 --> 39:21.525
And, like, that made
us very comforted.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.194
I mean, that's not
the stereotype.

39:23.195 --> 39:26.613
The stereotype is that this
is an intolerant state

39:26.614 --> 39:28.365
filled with, you know,
right-wing cowboys

39:28.366 --> 39:29.616
who don't like foreigners.

39:29.617 --> 39:30.452
Not Houston.

39:30.453 --> 39:31.285
Definitely not.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.578
In the beginning, you might
feel that Texans are,

39:33.579 --> 39:37.792
like, not that friendly to
you, but once you know them,

39:35.414 --> 39:37.791
they are really friendly people.

39:37.792 --> 39:41.461
We see this is the
best place to dream

39:41.462 --> 39:42.587
and achieve the dream.

39:42.588 --> 39:46.489
The same opportunities in India
I get, I won't make as much

39:46.490 --> 39:49.136
of my life as I would over here.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.473
You work hard in this
country, and if you put your

39:51.474 --> 39:53.996
mind to something, you
know, it is achievable,

39:53.997 --> 39:58.020
and I think so America
is land of opportunity

39:58.021 --> 40:01.439
and best place to
stay in the world.

40:01.440 --> 40:05.361
Some people say, "Make
America great again."

40:05.362 --> 40:08.364
I say America was
great all along.

40:08.365 --> 40:11.158
Some of us just forgot why.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.577
It's great because your
grandfather and my grandfather

40:13.578 --> 40:16.330
and just about everybody's
damn grandfather

40:16.331 --> 40:19.124
or great-grandfather
crammed themselves,

40:19.125 --> 40:23.087
snuck, bought their way,
or was dragged onto a boat

40:23.088 --> 40:25.463
and one way or another
allowed themselves

40:25.464 --> 40:28.300
eventually to dream.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.699
You still can.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.095
There's still room.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.411
And in some places in
America, apparently you

40:34.412 --> 40:36.474
are still welcome.

40:36.475 --> 40:39.312
Welcome, stranger.
