WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:03.280
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:03.280 --> 00:06.060
there's a structure in the swamp fred

00:06.060 --> 00:09.150
said it's somewhere between here and on

00:09.150 --> 00:11.410
there let's find it what do you make of

00:11.410 --> 00:15.490
that right there look at this oh yeah we

00:15.490 --> 00:18.170
did find something thumb convinced it's

00:18.170 --> 00:19.170
a record

00:19.170 --> 00:21.670
look at all the targets in your head and

00:21.670 --> 00:23.710
eyeline there's a triangle on top of the

00:23.710 --> 00:25.020
triangle where was the point it's

00:25.020 --> 00:27.290
actually pointing to the stone triangle

00:27.290 --> 00:31.070
on the island

00:31.070 --> 00:34.500
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.500 --> 00:36.210
where people have been looking for an

00:36.210 --> 00:39.190
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.190 --> 00:43.080
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.080 --> 00:46.570
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.570 --> 00:50.240
symbols carved into it more than a 17th

00:50.240 --> 00:53.820
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:53.820 --> 00:58.480
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:58.480 --> 00:59.910
and according to legend

01:00.010 --> 01:05.720
we'll have to die before the treasure
can be found

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:20.299 --> 01:23.030
into the wardroom we go I thought the

01:23.030 --> 01:24.920
war room was a hint open this is the

01:24.920 --> 01:27.150
original war room while the Oak Island

01:27.150 --> 01:29.090
team continues their search for a

01:29.090 --> 01:31.720
qualified diver to help them get to the

01:31.720 --> 01:35.420
bottom of borehole 10x Marty lagina his

01:35.420 --> 01:38.190
son Alex and his business partner Craig

01:38.190 --> 01:41.020
tester have invited side-scan sonar

01:41.020 --> 01:44.140
experts Mike Roberts and Dave Delaney to

01:44.140 --> 01:46.400
join them for an important meeting at

01:46.400 --> 01:48.680
Marty and Craig's offices in Traverse

01:48.680 --> 01:49.680
City Michigan

01:49.680 --> 01:52.980
they had interests in diving around Oak

01:52.980 --> 01:55.390
Island so I thought we'd see what

01:55.390 --> 01:57.360
they're thinking about doing and showing

01:57.360 --> 01:58.710
us and then we can see if we can

01:58.710 --> 02:00.170
incorporate it together I don't see why

02:00.170 --> 02:02.690
we can't mm-hmm so it'd be great to see

02:02.690 --> 02:05.979
what you got yeah well I'll show you in

02:05.979 --> 02:09.749
a nutshell here Craig in addition to

02:09.749 --> 02:12.680
being commercial divers Mike Roberts and

02:12.680 --> 02:15.329
Dave Delaney have more than 50 years of

02:15.329 --> 02:17.540
combined experience in the use of

02:17.540 --> 02:19.620
advanced underwater visualization

02:19.620 --> 02:22.989
technology and you guys ever run

02:22.989 --> 02:24.209
sub-bottom profiler

02:24.209 --> 02:25.890
oh yeah we're in some other profilers

02:25.890 --> 02:28.579
all around okay what would a sub baton

02:28.579 --> 02:30.180
profiler show you well

02:30.180 --> 02:34.299
it's designed to show you anything below

02:34.299 --> 02:36.319
the surface at the bottom you know down

02:36.319 --> 02:39.180
to what depends on the bottom makeup

02:39.180 --> 02:40.799
actually the one we ran was probably

02:40.799 --> 02:45.060
showing us 10 15 feet down sub bottom

02:45.060 --> 02:48.060
profilers send sound pulses that not

02:48.060 --> 02:50.519
only bounce off of the ocean floor but

02:50.519 --> 02:52.749
also penetrate the layers of sediment

02:52.749 --> 02:53.749
below

02:53.749 --> 02:56.219
creating a three-dimensional model of

02:56.219 --> 02:58.900
natural features while also identifying

02:58.900 --> 03:02.739
possible man-made objects a few years

03:02.739 --> 03:04.790
ago this is where we did our diving here

03:04.790 --> 03:07.099
and it's only around 57 feet

03:07.099 --> 03:09.540
we were down scanning it and we did find

03:09.540 --> 03:13.090
something on the bottom unconvinced as a

03:13.090 --> 03:15.230
wreck of something now what it is I

03:15.230 --> 03:18.749
don't know a wreck off the coast of Oak

03:18.749 --> 03:21.499
Island is it possible that the Oak

03:21.499 --> 03:24.170
Island treasure may not be located on

03:24.170 --> 03:28.349
the island after all but just offshore

03:28.349 --> 03:30.819
after we found it like a whole filing

03:30.819 --> 03:33.769
typically does do you skipped here then

03:33.769 --> 03:34.849
we would pack the next year

03:34.849 --> 03:36.930
good annoying record if it couldn't find

03:36.930 --> 03:39.810
it maybe because it gets melted over but

03:39.810 --> 03:41.980
I know it's there self changes on the

03:41.980 --> 03:44.230
bottom all the time then what I'm hoping

03:44.230 --> 03:46.109
is it because of the winter we had down

03:46.109 --> 03:47.349
there with the winds and everything and

03:47.349 --> 03:49.719
live seas maybe it's cleared off the

03:49.719 --> 03:51.651
bottom a little bit that way that would

03:51.651 --> 03:55.279
be worth finding yeah it is well-known

03:55.279 --> 03:57.799
that the waters of Mahone Bay where Oak

03:57.799 --> 04:00.719
Island is located were once part of the

04:00.719 --> 04:02.650
trade route between Europe and the new

04:02.650 --> 04:06.719
world in the 16th and 17th centuries it

04:06.719 --> 04:08.689
was also here during the height of

04:08.689 --> 04:11.349
piracy that merchant ships and the

04:11.349 --> 04:14.139
valuable cargo they carried fell victim

04:14.139 --> 04:15.469
to attack and plunder

04:15.469 --> 04:19.730
could finding evidence of a shipwreck in

04:19.730 --> 04:22.089
these waters offer a connection to the

04:22.089 --> 04:24.480
stories about buried treasure being on

04:24.480 --> 04:27.860
Oak Island Mike and I teamed up and

04:27.860 --> 04:29.560
we're hoping to go back there again this

04:29.560 --> 04:32.500
year and located so what are you doing

04:32.500 --> 04:33.940
different this time well we've got a

04:33.940 --> 04:38.130
higher resolution sooner side scan sonar

04:38.130 --> 04:40.470
we are trying to figuratively leave no

04:40.470 --> 04:43.370
stone unturned out here

04:43.370 --> 04:45.760
the fact that the island how it looks

04:45.760 --> 04:47.570
today is not how it looked a hundred

04:47.570 --> 04:50.100
years ago 200 years ago 300 years ago

04:50.100 --> 04:52.720
the shoreline has changed markedly we

04:52.720 --> 04:54.470
want to make sure we do everything we

04:54.470 --> 04:57.590
legally can to search the seafloor too

04:57.590 --> 05:00.080
and so these guys have state-of-the-art

05:00.080 --> 05:05.150
side-scan sonar and their divers too so

05:05.150 --> 05:06.840
we're going to you know try and gather

05:06.840 --> 05:09.980
that data and see where it might lead us

05:09.980 --> 05:11.920
okay yeah let's do it let's work

05:11.920 --> 05:13.480
together let's figure this out look

05:13.480 --> 05:16.280
forward to it Maceo Nova Scotia

05:23.980 --> 05:26.280
back on Oak Island Rick lagina and

05:26.280 --> 05:29.110
Island historian Charles Barkhouse have

05:29.110 --> 05:31.300
begun the team's second joint drilling

05:31.300 --> 05:34.370
operation with Island resident Fred

05:34.370 --> 05:36.350
Nolan what do we got oh these are the

05:36.350 --> 05:40.110
first course and it's very cool

05:40.110 --> 05:42.340
last week shortly after forging a

05:42.340 --> 05:44.050
cooperative agreement with Fred

05:44.050 --> 05:46.430
which ended more than four decades of a

05:46.430 --> 05:49.240
bitter rivalry between the 87 year-old

05:49.240 --> 05:52.050
treasure hunter and dan Blankenship time

05:52.050 --> 05:58.840
to quit the Rick Marty and their

05:58.840 --> 06:01.410
partners explored a site on Fred's

06:01.410 --> 06:03.870
property where based on his detailed

06:03.870 --> 06:06.750
surveys friend believed a man-made

06:06.750 --> 06:09.430
tunnel or chamber lies buried beneath

06:09.430 --> 06:13.720
several feet of hard slate

06:13.720 --> 06:15.370
although the search for the mysterious

06:15.370 --> 06:18.830
void ended unsuccessfully the team did

06:18.830 --> 06:21.210
uncover something of potentially great

06:21.210 --> 06:27.030
significance a large wooden stake look

06:27.030 --> 06:33.160
how nice and shaped it is definitely

06:33.160 --> 06:35.420
man-made

06:35.420 --> 06:38.280
today Rick has hired Logan drilling from

06:38.280 --> 06:41.180
Stewie act Nova Scotia to drill at a

06:41.180 --> 06:44.430
second spot on Fred's property just

06:44.430 --> 06:46.650
north of the mysterious triangle-shaped

06:46.650 --> 06:49.140
swamp where Fred believes an even

06:49.140 --> 06:52.450
greater discovery could be made the next

06:52.450 --> 06:55.889
hole has a curious history it's what

06:55.889 --> 06:59.000
fred has come to call the old well he

06:59.000 --> 07:00.990
had done some survey working the swamp

07:00.990 --> 07:03.210
once they got out of the swamp

07:03.210 --> 07:06.420
they were probing and they hit a hollow

07:06.420 --> 07:10.000
sound they cleared the material away

07:10.000 --> 07:11.371
there's about an inch inch and a half

07:11.371 --> 07:14.520
two inches of slate covering this

07:14.520 --> 07:18.350
depression it's actually a well rocked

07:18.350 --> 07:19.350
up well

07:19.350 --> 07:23.889
adding intrigue to their search is the

07:23.889 --> 07:26.530
fact that the land they are on once

07:26.530 --> 07:30.120
belonged to Anthony graves a mysterious

07:30.120 --> 07:33.400
mid 19th century landowner who was known

07:33.400 --> 07:36.230
to pay his debts with ancient Spanish

07:36.230 --> 07:37.270
silver coins

07:37.270 --> 07:40.840
that's number one

07:40.840 --> 07:45.510
was that twenty to nine transitions to a

07:45.510 --> 07:46.510
slate clay and then at twenty eight nine

07:46.510 --> 07:47.510
she turns over in just slate and we're

07:47.510 --> 07:52.360
in the slate all the way now these are

07:52.360 --> 07:56.270
the breaks in the course

07:56.270 --> 07:58.690
using a three-inch coring bit drillers

07:58.690 --> 08:01.530
Harold Fraser and Jason pike will be

08:01.530 --> 08:04.430
taking samples every six feet as they

08:04.430 --> 08:06.690
carefully search for evidence of the

08:06.690 --> 08:09.930
ancient Wow

08:09.930 --> 08:14.740
and there really is a room a void a

08:14.740 --> 08:16.820
tunnel it's exactly what we were looking

08:16.820 --> 08:18.850
for void in the slate

08:18.850 --> 08:32.114
fifty to four right there okay

08:32.114 --> 08:33.114
beautiful stuff when it goes through the

08:33.114 --> 08:34.114
slate doesn't

08:34.114 --> 08:36.708
aesthetically it's pretty but pretty

08:36.708 --> 08:39.599
it's not war luck or no Harold no voyage

08:39.599 --> 08:40.599
Eddie

08:40.599 --> 08:43.240
no boys no oh I don't know what a hit

08:43.240 --> 08:46.839
one if I go through a void I'll see it

08:46.839 --> 08:48.420
in in the drill string and plus the

08:48.420 --> 08:49.420
gauge is right

08:49.420 --> 08:53.920
unlike the eastern portion of Oak Island

08:53.920 --> 08:56.399
which is comprised of bedrock made of

08:56.399 --> 08:59.420
naturally porous and hydride the western

08:59.420 --> 09:01.540
portion where the team is exploring

09:01.540 --> 09:05.100
today is made up of hard finely layered

09:05.100 --> 09:08.079
slave a substance not known to have

09:08.079 --> 09:11.480
occurrences of natural voice beneath it

09:24.580 --> 09:26.060
you might have what might have missed

09:26.060 --> 09:27.060
you in her hands

09:27.060 --> 09:29.930
okay let's hop that broke on bottom zabi

09:29.930 --> 09:35.290
we've got a void see that that doesn't

09:35.290 --> 09:38.080
even match Darren right right what's the

09:38.080 --> 09:39.970
possible significance of that well that

09:39.970 --> 09:42.240
tell you it almost tells me that there's

09:42.240 --> 09:45.350
a void or something guys that parish

09:45.350 --> 09:47.610
should match up the back right huh it

09:47.610 --> 09:51.040
doesn't they don't seem to know has the

09:51.040 --> 09:53.670
Oak Island team really discovered an

09:53.670 --> 09:55.899
underground void on Fred Nolan's

09:55.899 --> 09:59.459
property a void just below a layer of

09:59.459 --> 10:00.569
hard slate

10:29.269 --> 10:31.769
while searching for an ancient well just

10:31.769 --> 10:33.800
north of the swamp on Fred Nolan's

10:33.800 --> 10:37.089
property Rick lagina may have just made

10:37.089 --> 10:40.540
an important discovery here we are we're

10:40.540 --> 10:43.839
at 106 feet and then no core out of the

10:43.839 --> 10:47.920
hole and then a small piece at add 111

10:47.920 --> 10:50.209
add it up it's 5 feet of void

10:50.209 --> 10:56.399
oh here's Fred we got some news for you

10:56.399 --> 11:00.269
Fred come on here I hope it's good news

11:00.269 --> 11:01.269
well

11:01.269 --> 11:03.629
we need some for those yes we do

11:03.629 --> 11:09.260
Harold thinks he hit a void between 106

11:09.260 --> 11:10.670
and 111

11:10.670 --> 11:13.579
yeah five foot boy this was the core of

11:13.579 --> 11:14.879
that came out after the void

11:34.079 --> 11:35.079
like that

11:35.079 --> 11:36.079
it was like they took an elixir of youth

11:36.079 --> 11:37.079
in that moment he was animated he was

11:37.079 --> 11:39.050
reaching down looking at the core he

11:39.050 --> 11:41.209
repeated several times five feet five

11:41.209 --> 11:42.610
feet of boy that's incredible that's

11:42.610 --> 11:49.999
incredible

11:49.999 --> 11:52.220
if this turns into something the

11:52.220 --> 11:54.209
breakthrough I know kind of that

11:54.209 --> 11:57.879
everyone is long sought and long desire

11:57.879 --> 12:00.679
that's a pretty wonderful date although

12:00.679 --> 12:02.990
sharing the news of a possible

12:02.990 --> 12:05.230
breakthrough with Fred Nolan brings Rick

12:05.230 --> 12:07.970
lagina great satisfaction there is

12:07.970 --> 12:10.759
another person is eager to tell his

12:10.759 --> 12:15.389
brother Marty hello got something

12:15.389 --> 12:20.110
strange happened here at 106 X it would

12:20.110 --> 12:24.010
seem that we have a five foot boy yeah I

12:24.010 --> 12:26.319
mean I asked Harold his word is it's

12:26.319 --> 12:30.129
very unusual enjoy it for 30 years you

12:30.129 --> 12:32.100
know would have been nice if there were

12:32.100 --> 12:34.550
some kind of human artifact came up

12:34.550 --> 12:38.420
there like you know nothing

12:38.420 --> 12:39.929
look it's curious I mean that's what we

12:39.929 --> 12:42.529
were looking for avoiding this late

12:42.529 --> 12:44.639
great although it will take further

12:44.639 --> 12:47.360
investigation to confirm whether or not

12:47.360 --> 12:49.980
the team has located a man-made tunnel

12:49.980 --> 12:53.829
or cavern one thing is for sure Rick

12:53.829 --> 12:56.329
Marty and the team's agreement with Fred

12:56.329 --> 13:00.509
Nolan is starting to yield results okay

13:00.509 --> 13:02.699
no gold but surely interesting

13:23.699 --> 13:26.279
after receiving evidence that Fred

13:26.279 --> 13:28.679
Nolan's information could very well lead

13:28.679 --> 13:31.910
to even more exciting discoveries jack

13:31.910 --> 13:35.249
begley along with Marty lagina son Alex

13:35.249 --> 13:38.639
and Charles Barkhouse travel 48 miles

13:38.639 --> 13:41.709
north of Oak Island to the Bedford

13:41.709 --> 13:46.850
Institute of Oceanography in Halifax we

13:46.850 --> 13:48.999
got in contact with dr. Bob Gordon and

13:48.999 --> 13:50.259
he's an oceanographer

13:50.259 --> 13:52.910
he's gonna go over a sea bottom map it

13:52.910 --> 13:55.189
supposedly shows artifacts on it that

13:55.189 --> 13:57.179
mr. Nolan was talking about it'd be good

13:57.179 --> 14:04.139
to get his opinion on I think so too

14:04.139 --> 14:06.550
hi welcome to Bedford institution over

14:06.550 --> 14:08.869
in Charles Bob Courtney hooks it's nice

14:08.869 --> 14:11.230
to meet you Bob Alex I'm Jack Jack

14:11.230 --> 14:12.540
pleasure to have you here

14:12.540 --> 14:13.820
no thanks very much we're gonna go down

14:13.820 --> 14:14.860
the library and take a look at the

14:14.860 --> 14:18.069
materials great okay the way dr.

14:18.069 --> 14:20.459
Courtney is an expert in recording and

14:20.459 --> 14:23.279
studying bathymetric s-- the topography

14:23.279 --> 14:26.899
of underwater surfaces Alex Charles and

14:26.899 --> 14:29.689
Jack have come here to follow up on

14:29.689 --> 14:31.949
information about the mysterious

14:31.949 --> 14:34.589
triangle-shaped swamp that was shared by

14:34.589 --> 14:36.999
Fred Nolan during a recent meeting in

14:36.999 --> 14:39.660
the war room is there a point of

14:39.660 --> 14:42.079
interest in the swamp oh yeah there's a

14:42.079 --> 14:43.850
lot of interesting points but they're

14:43.850 --> 14:46.779
hard to get to understand about the

14:46.779 --> 14:50.209
swamp we do understand that yeah you had

14:50.209 --> 14:51.980
made mentioned that at the point at

14:51.980 --> 14:54.290
which you tried to drain the swamp that

14:54.290 --> 14:56.540
you had seen these Timbers a timbered

14:56.540 --> 15:01.869
wall now where exactly did you see that

15:01.869 --> 15:05.069
on the beach itself it's it's back there

15:05.069 --> 15:06.370
we're gonna find the entrance they

15:06.370 --> 15:09.819
appear to be sawn Timbers about that

15:09.819 --> 15:12.680
square one was on top of the other and

15:12.680 --> 15:14.930
they went down for 12 feet did you not

15:14.930 --> 15:17.449
expose any of it just a little top to

15:17.449 --> 15:21.179
see that see that they were square how

15:21.179 --> 15:23.920
wide did you think it was it looked to

15:23.920 --> 15:28.079
me about 12 feet

15:28.079 --> 15:31.309
a timbered wall between the swamp and

15:31.309 --> 15:35.160
the beach could this be the irrefutable

15:35.160 --> 15:37.180
proof the team has been looking for that

15:37.180 --> 15:42.519
the swamp is in fact man-made I believe

15:42.519 --> 15:45.110
this thing is there and it's findable

15:45.110 --> 15:48.610
and if it's findable we corn we did it

15:48.610 --> 15:51.149
has to be original works that

15:51.149 --> 15:53.800
information is invaluable you had

15:53.800 --> 15:56.379
mentioned the other day about your

15:56.379 --> 15:58.519
belief about the salt shore you

15:58.519 --> 16:00.429
mentioned that the shorelines was much

16:00.429 --> 16:03.199
different than it currently is yeah you

16:03.199 --> 16:07.050
look a picture of Oak Island mm-hmm

16:07.050 --> 16:11.620
see presently the elements like that the

16:11.620 --> 16:15.069
island used to be out here like this now

16:15.069 --> 16:17.430
it's all water see this was all dug out

16:17.430 --> 16:20.439
and the flood gate is out here which

16:20.439 --> 16:23.709
floods this wall

16:23.709 --> 16:25.250
what they did was they ripped it all

16:25.250 --> 16:27.739
over and created the beach want it back

16:27.739 --> 16:31.429
of the swamp and there are two berms

16:31.429 --> 16:34.660
that run from me there over towards

16:34.660 --> 16:37.350
Mahone Bay so you're saying that the

16:37.350 --> 16:41.769
whole South Shore was out 300 feet and

16:41.769 --> 16:43.929
they they tore it up and just dumped

16:43.929 --> 16:48.149
land in lines no way from where the

16:48.149 --> 16:52.829
island was yeah so what you see here is

16:52.829 --> 16:57.179
a map of the bathymetry or the seabed

16:57.179 --> 16:58.179
off Oak Island

16:58.179 --> 17:00.619
the bathymetric or underwater

17:00.619 --> 17:02.749
topographical map that dr.

17:02.749 --> 17:03.749
Courtney is

17:03.749 --> 17:06.980
showing Alex Jack and Charles not only

17:06.980 --> 17:09.160
shows variations in the depth of the

17:09.160 --> 17:12.380
seabed it also reveals several curious

17:12.380 --> 17:15.050
shapes and anomalies on the ocean floor

17:15.050 --> 17:17.760
surrounding Oak Island in the offshore

17:17.760 --> 17:19.880
you'll see this colored map and it's

17:19.880 --> 17:22.410
color-coded so the red tones are the

17:22.410 --> 17:25.260
shallow water and the blue are tones are

17:25.260 --> 17:27.040
deeper water but there's some features

17:27.040 --> 17:28.840
here that we don't know when these

17:28.840 --> 17:31.090
features were created we don't know who

17:31.090 --> 17:33.890
did it but we can't recognize certain

17:33.890 --> 17:36.070
features that would you know our

17:36.070 --> 17:37.840
experience tell us they're not natural

17:37.840 --> 17:39.840
for example you'll see ridges were

17:39.840 --> 17:44.010
running perpendicular to the coast and

17:44.010 --> 17:45.930
typically if it was a natural process

17:45.930 --> 17:47.540
they parallel to the coast sort of a

17:47.540 --> 17:50.670
shoreline feature but these would

17:50.670 --> 17:54.530
probably have a man-made origin

17:54.530 --> 17:56.180
that's what we'd be interested in yeah

17:56.180 --> 17:58.070
yeah those are the ones that Fred Nolan

17:58.070 --> 18:00.060
was talking about yeah there are other

18:00.060 --> 18:02.340
features of interest that during this

18:02.340 --> 18:05.520
feature here that would be typically a

18:05.520 --> 18:07.870
shipwreck

18:07.870 --> 18:12.640
at the Bedford Institute of ocean FA in

18:12.640 --> 18:16.410
Halifax Nova Scotia Alex lagina jack

18:16.410 --> 18:19.600
begley and Charles Barkhouse have just

18:19.600 --> 18:21.950
received information from dr. Bob

18:21.950 --> 18:24.560
Courtney that there could be important

18:24.560 --> 18:27.000
evidence located just off the southern

18:27.000 --> 18:31.040
shore of Oak Island this feature here

18:31.040 --> 18:32.910
that would be typically a shipper

18:32.910 --> 18:37.560
Wow really that's interesting that one I

18:37.560 --> 18:40.120
didn't see that one yeah there is

18:40.120 --> 18:42.000
supposed to be a shipwreck 2,000 feet

18:42.000 --> 18:44.120
off the South Col well that would

18:44.120 --> 18:46.870
probably be a good place yeah there are

18:46.870 --> 18:50.190
also some very curious arguer type

18:50.190 --> 18:52.120
features that we see in the in the basin

18:52.120 --> 18:54.710
sediments a softer sediment offshore and

18:54.710 --> 18:56.750
they're quite long there you know 600

18:56.750 --> 18:59.280
meters long and we believe these are

18:59.280 --> 19:02.070
real we don't know the origin of those

19:02.070 --> 19:04.630
as well so that's simply be from an

19:04.630 --> 19:07.330
anchor that could be a mooring field

19:07.330 --> 19:08.810
would be my guess

19:08.810 --> 19:12.670
a Maureen field could the area dr.

19:12.670 --> 19:15.630
Courtney is referring to be the actual

19:15.630 --> 19:18.690
place where ships laid anchor while a

19:18.690 --> 19:20.540
valuable treasure was being buried on

19:20.540 --> 19:24.290
Oak Island these two things here these

19:24.290 --> 19:26.640
are look look like dredge spoils to make

19:26.640 --> 19:30.620
like a skull

19:30.620 --> 19:36.100
it does look like a skull it does look

19:36.100 --> 19:37.910
like a skull yeah that's kind of like a

19:37.910 --> 19:40.630
scone yeah that's a warning obviously

19:40.630 --> 19:42.680
there's a theory that that there's a

19:42.680 --> 19:47.020
mounds of spoils and that soil was

19:47.020 --> 19:48.500
what's probably excavated from the

19:48.500 --> 19:51.500
tunnels taken out and dumped into the

19:51.500 --> 19:53.500
ocean and they're supposed to be - two

19:53.500 --> 19:56.140
large mounds in this area well this kind

19:56.140 --> 19:59.670
of looks like a yeah address falls in me

19:59.670 --> 20:01.290
typically we see those things in

20:01.290 --> 20:03.230
environments where there's a big slide

20:03.230 --> 20:04.290
down the mountain but there's no

20:04.290 --> 20:07.930
mountains here no it looks like somebody

20:07.930 --> 20:09.860
had been dumping something but you'd

20:09.860 --> 20:11.550
have to go that possible could have been

20:11.550 --> 20:14.080
a dumping site possibly it very possible

20:14.080 --> 20:17.360
yes we met with Fred Nolan he his idea

20:17.360 --> 20:20.190
was that this was all land at one time

20:20.190 --> 20:22.690
and it was actually dredged out or

20:22.690 --> 20:24.770
cleaned out by the original depositors

20:24.770 --> 20:28.160
to create this this dike or berm for the

20:28.160 --> 20:31.770
swamp well we certainly land 12,000

20:31.770 --> 20:32.770
years ago right

20:32.770 --> 20:36.370
but was it land 300 years ago 400 or 500

20:36.370 --> 20:39.190
yeah that's another question you look at

20:39.190 --> 20:41.780
the depth chart here it's it's at

20:41.780 --> 20:45.020
something like five meters water depth

20:45.020 --> 20:47.760
and in the past sea level was lower

20:47.760 --> 20:51.780
probably a meter or two lower 300 years

20:51.780 --> 20:55.180
ago or 400 years ago so probably this

20:55.180 --> 20:58.420
shoreline was both somewhat with

20:58.420 --> 21:00.330
corroboree of evidence that several

21:00.330 --> 21:02.780
man-made features lie in the water

21:02.780 --> 21:06.050
surrounding Oak Island Alex Charles and

21:06.050 --> 21:08.570
Jack are convinced that they are on the

21:08.570 --> 21:11.150
verge of another important breakthrough

21:11.150 --> 21:13.440
in the 220 year old mystery

21:13.440 --> 21:16.520
well great I mean that's great it's

21:16.520 --> 21:17.950
really interesting stuff so thank you

21:17.950 --> 21:19.640
very much for showing us and it's my

21:19.640 --> 21:21.020
pipe walking us through it

21:21.020 --> 21:25.070
thank you very much money to meet you

21:25.070 --> 21:36.360
take care thank you I can't you Lance

21:36.360 --> 21:41.230
all good yep yeah oh yeah

21:41.230 --> 21:42.850
excited by the information they learned

21:42.850 --> 21:45.730
at the oceanographic institute Alex and

21:45.730 --> 21:48.190
Jack have returned to Oak Island eager

21:48.190 --> 21:51.160
to verify what they learned from dr.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.640
Courtney joining them are Jack step

21:53.640 --> 21:56.970
father Craig tester divers Mike Roberts

21:56.970 --> 21:59.770
and Dave Delaney local diver Tony

21:59.770 --> 22:02.830
Sampson and marine archaeologists

22:02.830 --> 22:06.060
brought Peterson what are we looking for

22:06.060 --> 22:08.160
first Smith's Cove for sure

22:08.160 --> 22:10.340
and then this side of the swamp well

22:10.340 --> 22:11.760
just did it as they're going across

22:11.760 --> 22:13.810
there it was the high tide I just want

22:13.810 --> 22:16.420
to get as close to the island as we can

22:16.420 --> 22:20.830
okay day we RAM 18 feet of water if you

22:20.830 --> 22:22.660
want to drop the fish okay sounds good

22:22.660 --> 22:28.340
today we're gonna start exploring the

22:28.340 --> 22:31.050
waters around Oak Island we're gonna use

22:31.050 --> 22:34.910
a starfish it's a side-scan sonar and

22:34.910 --> 22:36.520
basically what it's doing is taking an

22:36.520 --> 22:39.320
image of the bottom of the ocean we're

22:39.320 --> 22:41.130
looking for rocks we're looking for logs

22:41.130 --> 22:43.110
we're looking for holes in the ground or

22:43.110 --> 22:46.350
anything we can see that's coming in now

22:46.350 --> 22:48.200
okay both sides yeah yeah

22:48.200 --> 22:54.380
the starfish 990 F side-scan sonar

22:54.380 --> 22:58.760
device will be towed off the back of the

22:58.760 --> 23:00.570
boat using sound waves it will be able

23:00.570 --> 23:03.320
to detect and obtain high-resolution

23:03.320 --> 23:06.140
images of any objects or formations on

23:06.140 --> 23:08.610
the ocean floor within an approximate

23:08.610 --> 23:10.760
range of 210 feet

23:10.760 --> 23:15.700
you gave a good each week we got a big

23:15.700 --> 23:18.090
dead pundits like she's off the bottom

23:18.090 --> 23:19.800
quite a bit can we slow it down I need

23:19.800 --> 23:22.240
to let the fish drop yeah yeah three

23:22.240 --> 23:24.540
point four a day is there any way you

23:24.540 --> 23:27.550
can get to in order to allow the sonar

23:27.550 --> 23:30.560
unit to scan deeper below the surface

23:30.560 --> 23:33.320
Tony Sampson needs to slow down to two

23:33.320 --> 23:36.070
knots or a little more than two miles

23:36.070 --> 23:37.070
per hour

23:37.070 --> 23:41.620
I'm bringing it down down to 49 2.4

23:41.620 --> 23:44.950
how's that looking better much better

23:44.950 --> 23:50.730
c41 how they looking got an amazing

23:50.730 --> 23:51.980
image amazing give me how it's beautiful

23:51.980 --> 23:54.540
think I could take a look

23:54.540 --> 23:58.030
getting some awesome images we're coming

23:58.030 --> 24:00.520
up on the boulderless beach now guys

24:00.520 --> 24:05.190
okay one of the most curious features on

24:05.190 --> 24:07.460
the north side of the island is a

24:07.460 --> 24:09.840
stretch of beach that unlike almost

24:09.840 --> 24:12.370
every foot of coastline has no large

24:12.370 --> 24:15.730
rocks or boulders it has long been

24:15.730 --> 24:18.530
speculated by dan Blankenship that the

24:18.530 --> 24:21.070
so called boulderless beach might be

24:21.070 --> 24:26.950
man-made but if so for what purpose

24:26.950 --> 24:29.150
could it be to conceal another series of

24:29.150 --> 24:33.500
box drains like the ones at Smith's Cove

24:33.500 --> 24:36.590
that's probably a log of something a lot

24:36.590 --> 24:39.010
of boulders in the water here so see

24:39.010 --> 24:41.400
this this is really interesting see the

24:41.400 --> 24:44.530
way we're seeing these lines like yeah

24:44.530 --> 24:45.661
right what do you think that's wrong I

24:45.661 --> 24:47.270
mean if you said what does a boat look

24:47.270 --> 24:55.730
like on the water it looks like that

24:55.730 --> 24:57.020
I mean if you said there's a boat look

24:57.020 --> 24:59.750
like on the wall so it looks like God

24:59.750 --> 25:01.710
just off the northern shore of Oak

25:01.710 --> 25:05.360
Island Jack Begley Craig tester and Alex

25:05.360 --> 25:08.250
lagina along with marine archaeologist

25:08.250 --> 25:10.770
Ron Peterson and a team of professional

25:10.770 --> 25:14.030
divers continue looking for clues on the

25:14.030 --> 25:15.030
seabed

25:15.030 --> 25:19.880
look at this see that oh yeah it's flat

25:19.880 --> 25:21.800
on the back and then work it that that

25:21.800 --> 25:25.200
looks just like a bomb to me during the

25:25.200 --> 25:26.960
two hundred and twenty year old search

25:26.960 --> 25:29.080
for treasure on Oak Island there are

25:29.080 --> 25:31.150
many who believe that the answer to the

25:31.150 --> 25:34.300
mystery lies not underground but

25:34.300 --> 25:38.500
underwater in 1791 during the height of

25:38.500 --> 25:42.320
the bloody French Revolution King Louis

25:42.320 --> 25:44.740
the sixteenth of France and his wife

25:44.740 --> 25:48.280
Marie Antoinette attempted to flee Paris

25:48.280 --> 25:50.590
before they were imprisoned and executed

25:50.590 --> 25:53.450
of the many stories concerning their

25:53.450 --> 25:54.450
plight

25:54.450 --> 25:56.580
there is one that suggests that the

25:56.580 --> 25:58.700
Queen gathered up her jewels and other

25:58.700 --> 26:01.700
valuables and sent him off ahead in the

26:01.700 --> 26:03.860
care of her closest and Megan

26:03.860 --> 26:07.020
the handmaiden is said to have first

26:07.020 --> 26:09.360
taken the jewels to London and later

26:09.360 --> 26:15.360
across the Atlantic to Nova Scotia

26:15.360 --> 26:17.270
is it possible that the ship that was

26:17.270 --> 26:20.710
carrying the jewels never made it to

26:20.710 --> 26:21.710
land

26:21.710 --> 26:24.500
could it have been sunk along with the

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
jewels

26:25.500 --> 26:29.960
just offshore did you see the image of

26:29.960 --> 26:33.951
symmetrical sides rounded Stan well look

26:33.951 --> 26:35.450
at all the targets to see which one's

26:35.450 --> 26:39.940
their best and go ahead and dive on

26:39.940 --> 26:42.020
as Craig and the team continued their

26:42.020 --> 26:44.230
search for clues by heading to the

26:44.230 --> 26:49.710
southern shore of the island Rick lagina

26:49.710 --> 26:52.400
along with Dave Blankenship and veteran

26:52.400 --> 26:55.070
treasure hunter dan henskee arrived at

26:55.070 --> 26:57.460
the southern border of the swamp in an

26:57.460 --> 27:00.080
attempt to verify another of Fred

27:00.080 --> 27:06.930
Nolan's incredible findings no they are

27:06.930 --> 27:09.380
looking to uncover the wood timber wall

27:09.380 --> 27:12.250
that Fred claims he located after he

27:12.250 --> 27:17.350
partially drained the swamp back in 1969

27:17.350 --> 27:19.130
long ago when he had a parcel brought

27:19.130 --> 27:21.741
out of the swamp he probed the wall of

27:21.741 --> 27:24.610
the swamp and he is saying that there's

27:24.610 --> 27:31.080
a structure in that wall Fred said

27:31.080 --> 27:33.510
between here and that clump of birch

27:33.510 --> 27:35.670
trees down there is where he thinks it

27:35.670 --> 27:41.050
is so well dig from the wetland area and

27:41.050 --> 27:44.210
dig I think since he's saying it's some

27:44.210 --> 27:47.560
work close to the road we'll dig from

27:47.560 --> 27:50.980
there maybe a foot or two into the road

27:50.980 --> 27:52.920
and we should be able to find it

27:52.920 --> 27:55.760
although rick has a 40-ton excavator at

27:55.760 --> 27:58.790
his disposal he must abide by several

27:58.790 --> 28:01.560
very strict environmental regulations

28:01.560 --> 28:04.860
good see again welcome to Oak Island

28:04.860 --> 28:07.880
yeah he also has a permit which only

28:07.880 --> 28:10.680
allows him to dig down approximately six

28:10.680 --> 28:13.690
feet and requires that he stayed no less

28:13.690 --> 28:15.980
than nine feet from the wetlands in

28:15.980 --> 28:18.500
order to ensure that the swamp is not

28:18.500 --> 28:20.650
breached the structures about ten or

28:20.650 --> 28:24.510
twelve feet long my idea is we go every

28:24.510 --> 28:28.810
five feet okay should hit it within this

28:28.810 --> 28:30.580
distance here yeah supposed to be right

28:30.580 --> 28:33.350
there let's find it okay

28:33.350 --> 28:41.540
given the fact that the team has several

28:41.540 --> 28:44.420
hundred feet to cover Rick knows it may

28:44.420 --> 28:46.850
take a number of tries before he finds

28:46.850 --> 28:48.480
what he is looking for

28:48.480 --> 28:50.270
no idea

28:50.270 --> 28:51.270
this is

28:51.270 --> 28:54.390
it's definitely not what we're looking

28:54.390 --> 29:05.950
for in any way shape or form

29:05.950 --> 29:12.560
that's one what's that

29:12.560 --> 29:15.740
after digging the six feet of soil that

29:15.740 --> 29:18.520
is permit allows Rick must stop

29:18.520 --> 29:22.530
so if we can move up to I'm thinking

29:22.530 --> 29:27.380
right here yeah hopefully moving at the

29:27.380 --> 29:29.360
road a few yards will produce better

29:29.360 --> 29:32.050
results my brothers always on about show

29:32.050 --> 29:33.890
me the data show me the proof he's a

29:33.890 --> 29:36.550
hard science guy so today maybe there

29:36.550 --> 29:40.170
really is hard day to hard proof he's on

29:40.170 --> 29:41.570
about he wants to be done with this walk

29:41.570 --> 29:43.950
but I think there's something there and

29:43.950 --> 29:45.880
if this is the door that gets us back in

29:45.880 --> 29:48.481
there I'm happy he's not oh well

29:48.481 --> 29:52.670
Ulric

29:52.670 --> 30:05.280
in this space you don't see anything

30:05.280 --> 30:12.630
nothing there rock I think the next spot

30:12.630 --> 30:17.970
will be right there okay

30:17.970 --> 30:23.741
of that right there it looks like some

30:23.741 --> 30:31.840
kind of a log or something

30:31.840 --> 30:34.950
while excavating in the area near the

30:34.950 --> 30:37.050
shoreline adjacent to the Oak Island

30:37.050 --> 30:39.700
swamp Rick lagina may be on the

30:39.700 --> 30:42.340
threshold of an important discovery

30:42.340 --> 30:46.610
that's manufactured manufactured wood

30:46.610 --> 30:48.750
found buried between the beach and the

30:48.750 --> 30:52.090
swamp could this be part of the ancient

30:52.090 --> 30:54.430
timber dam treasure hunter Fred Nolan

30:54.430 --> 30:56.860
claims to have found more than 40 years

30:56.860 --> 30:57.860
ago

30:57.860 --> 31:00.860
I think it's pressure-treated lumber

31:00.860 --> 31:03.650
because these gouges yeah if it is it's

31:03.650 --> 31:04.650
not old

31:04.650 --> 31:06.710
no it's not old curious that it's at

31:06.710 --> 31:09.800
that depth but this is a modern piece

31:09.800 --> 31:12.700
yeah okay next one I think will go on

31:12.700 --> 31:16.200
the other side of that large pine tree

31:16.200 --> 31:18.320
unfortunately the piece of wood is

31:18.320 --> 31:21.370
clearly a modern piece of timber but

31:21.370 --> 31:24.510
Rick lagina refuses to give up what do

31:24.510 --> 31:25.510
you make of that right there

31:25.510 --> 31:30.980
raisa stop brick

31:30.980 --> 31:34.670
okay so in my opinion we're all four

31:34.670 --> 31:37.180
five once again not yet

31:37.180 --> 31:39.260
I say we do one on the other side of

31:39.260 --> 31:44.620
those birch trees you in let me leave

31:44.620 --> 31:49.160
anyway no I won't do this to you but I

31:49.160 --> 31:52.210
hate giving up oh that's right not what

31:52.210 --> 31:54.030
we've tried on the other side of the

31:54.030 --> 31:55.880
birch trees yeah unfortunately it's on

31:55.880 --> 31:58.140
four five so hoping you can make it one

31:58.140 --> 32:00.030
four five well keep our fingers crossed

32:00.030 --> 32:01.900
I'll keep all my

32:01.900 --> 32:11.280
they'll settle for this last one being

32:11.280 --> 32:12.620
the

32:12.620 --> 32:20.660
it's baseball except over fellas over

32:20.660 --> 32:26.020
definitely not at timber

32:26.020 --> 32:30.350
it's a split log

32:30.350 --> 32:33.190
first off

32:33.190 --> 32:41.140
than I've seen so far after digging a

32:41.140 --> 32:43.480
half-dozen holes along the southern edge

32:43.480 --> 32:46.900
of the swamp Rick Dave and Dan have

32:46.900 --> 32:48.940
found no evidence of the ancient

32:48.940 --> 32:51.670
timbered wall Fred Nolan claims he saw

32:51.670 --> 32:55.340
some 30 years ago could it be that the

32:55.340 --> 32:57.760
wall lies just a few feet deeper than

32:57.760 --> 33:00.330
Rick was legally allowed to dig

33:00.330 --> 33:05.460
a legitimate shot given the fact that he

33:05.460 --> 33:06.840
the city probed it he said he saw it he

33:06.840 --> 33:07.840
could define the size of it

33:07.840 --> 33:09.060
the length of it you know how all it was

33:09.060 --> 33:14.760
I mean given all of that

33:14.760 --> 33:20.010
information I thought we would be

33:20.010 --> 33:23.500
so am I disappointed

33:23.500 --> 33:26.460
Rick remains undaunted and determined to

33:26.460 --> 33:29.470
return once he is armed with the permits

33:29.470 --> 33:31.680
that will allow him to properly excavate

33:31.680 --> 33:35.480
the area I'm thoroughly 100% committed

33:35.480 --> 33:38.320
to finding that thing I can't for the

33:38.320 --> 33:40.510
life of me think it's not there it's

33:40.510 --> 33:43.059
there we have to do what Fred said how

33:43.059 --> 33:45.930
he found it and that was he was in the

33:45.930 --> 33:48.540
swamp so we have to get wet if it's

33:48.540 --> 33:51.730
there I'm gonna find it okay Wayne we

33:51.730 --> 33:53.780
gave our best shot that's right thank

33:53.780 --> 33:55.850
you again appreciate it okay all right

33:55.850 --> 33:56.850
take care

33:56.850 --> 34:00.230
let's go home Brown time get out here

34:00.230 --> 34:06.900
disappointed but just tomorrow

34:06.900 --> 34:09.550
as Rick lagina suspends his operations

34:09.550 --> 34:14.020
at the Oak Island swamp Creek Jack Alex

34:14.020 --> 34:16.590
and their team are still hoping they

34:16.590 --> 34:18.550
will have a breakthrough by searching in

34:18.550 --> 34:22.250
the waters of the islands southern shore

34:22.250 --> 34:24.010
that's good depth there Dave

34:24.010 --> 34:27.540
a couple of good folders there let's

34:27.540 --> 34:32.159
increase the range a little bit

34:32.159 --> 34:33.440
that's probably a Lagos

34:33.440 --> 34:40.280
look at that was that's interesting

34:40.280 --> 34:43.870
look at the triangle to see the triumph

34:43.870 --> 34:46.230
out see yeah yeah

34:46.230 --> 34:48.139
so what we're looking at is see this

34:48.139 --> 34:51.260
triangular shape stone and on top of the

34:51.260 --> 34:53.929
stone is a perfect triangle

34:53.929 --> 34:55.969
I don't think mother nature made that

34:55.969 --> 34:56.969
Wow

34:56.969 --> 35:00.590
I don't know what to say I mean it do

35:00.590 --> 35:02.710
you ever see anything like that no I'm

35:02.710 --> 35:05.110
good where it is it's almost too much of

35:05.110 --> 35:07.720
a coincidence it was pointing pretty

35:07.720 --> 35:09.270
much straight at where the truth stone

35:09.270 --> 35:13.240
triangle used to be a triangle shaped

35:13.240 --> 35:15.970
stone with a second triangle shape on

35:15.970 --> 35:19.369
its surface and pointing to word another

35:19.369 --> 35:22.590
triangle of stones used to live

35:22.590 --> 35:24.710
before it was destroyed during a massive

35:24.710 --> 35:26.890
excavation of the island by treasure

35:26.890 --> 35:31.250
hunter robert dunfield in 1966 the

35:31.250 --> 35:33.830
so-called stone triangle was thought to

35:33.830 --> 35:36.480
be a key piece of evidence because it

35:36.480 --> 35:39.150
pointed on the true North line directly

35:39.150 --> 35:42.670
to the original money pit could this

35:42.670 --> 35:44.990
mysterious triangle-shaped stone

35:44.990 --> 35:47.350
submerged in the waters several hundred

35:47.350 --> 35:49.950
feet off of Oak Island south shore be

35:49.950 --> 35:51.460
another man-made marker

35:51.460 --> 35:55.560
if so how did it get there

35:55.560 --> 35:59.210
coming out to the water we're finished

35:59.210 --> 36:03.500
here

36:03.500 --> 36:06.630
it just made no sense to be natural now

36:06.630 --> 36:09.140
we got to get exact coordinates to find

36:09.140 --> 36:10.740
out for sure but it sure looked like

36:10.740 --> 36:12.570
what's pointing right towards the money

36:12.570 --> 36:15.720
pit okay guys I think we got quite a bit

36:15.720 --> 36:19.060
done today we got a number of hits yeah

36:19.060 --> 36:20.770
we found some pretty exciting stuff

36:20.770 --> 36:22.940
today and you can go through the image

36:22.940 --> 36:25.080
and you get the coordinates on the

36:25.080 --> 36:26.910
latitude and longitude that's right yeah

36:26.910 --> 36:28.571
yeah yeah let's do that

36:28.571 --> 36:31.210
I'd love to get the pictures show them

36:31.210 --> 36:33.530
to Marty and Rick Dan David all the

36:33.530 --> 36:34.840
other guys yeah

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
pretty exciting

36:35.840 --> 36:47.520
just be the place yep

36:47.520 --> 36:50.940
upstairs up for you after a long day of

36:50.940 --> 36:53.460
recording valuable data and side scan

36:53.460 --> 36:56.250
sonar images in the waters just off Oak

36:56.250 --> 37:00.170
Island Marty lagina joins his brother

37:00.170 --> 37:02.860
Rick their partner Craig tester and

37:02.860 --> 37:05.320
other members of the team at a nearby

37:05.320 --> 37:07.869
pub to share the day's findings so guys

37:07.869 --> 37:09.510
I was thinking we'd share the good news

37:09.510 --> 37:12.040
with my dad here which is that the

37:12.040 --> 37:13.720
technology we got to do the side scan

37:13.720 --> 37:15.550
works really really well really no

37:15.550 --> 37:16.940
glitches we've got some pretty exciting

37:16.940 --> 37:18.920
stuff for you to do and you know how I

37:18.920 --> 37:20.740
am you know I'm usually not super

37:20.740 --> 37:22.290
enthusiastic about these things cuz I

37:22.290 --> 37:23.341
always think oh well there's a

37:23.341 --> 37:24.341
reasonable

37:24.341 --> 37:28.340
I think we got something pretty

37:28.340 --> 37:30.780
seriously it's a really interesting

37:30.780 --> 37:34.560
stuff I do I do it's just one

37:34.560 --> 37:37.130
interesting thing that we found before

37:37.130 --> 37:39.020
you show me I mean you've seen a lot of

37:39.020 --> 37:41.010
stuff near the water right I mean where

37:41.010 --> 37:42.540
is this and this is Galen

37:42.540 --> 37:45.240
Wow what's that it's pretty interesting

37:45.240 --> 37:46.690
I've not seen it before

37:46.690 --> 37:49.230
all right especially where we are

37:49.230 --> 37:50.832
tell explain it to me though what am I

37:50.832 --> 37:52.770
looking at the run in the side-scan

37:52.770 --> 37:57.230
along the island and what we've got here

37:57.230 --> 37:58.350
is what appears to be on the bottom

37:58.350 --> 38:06.910
that's a stone triangle

38:06.910 --> 38:11.080
with a triangle on top and it's all

38:11.080 --> 38:13.490
symmetrical it's a triangle but what's

38:13.490 --> 38:15.730
the dark mean what does the dark mean on

38:15.730 --> 38:18.710
top there's another triangle on top of

38:18.710 --> 38:19.730
the triangle

38:19.730 --> 38:23.590
really that's significant Rick what do

38:23.590 --> 38:24.590
you think of this you describe them as a

38:24.590 --> 38:27.640
triangular like what Dan says pointer

38:27.640 --> 38:30.810
rock yeah what was appointed it's

38:30.810 --> 38:33.090
actually pointing to the stone triangle

38:33.090 --> 38:39.070
on the island seriously

38:39.070 --> 38:40.780
see it's definitely a triangle within a

38:40.780 --> 38:44.780
triangle sort of thing isn't it yeah I'm

38:44.780 --> 38:46.710
always skeptical of whatever we see and

38:46.710 --> 38:48.210
so when I saw that at first I thought

38:48.210 --> 38:49.420
all it's an equipment which it's

38:49.420 --> 38:51.040
something and I just cannot come up with

38:51.040 --> 38:52.700
an explanation for why that is so

38:52.700 --> 38:55.300
perfectly triangular well that is very

38:55.300 --> 38:57.600
odd I mean that is very I was I was sort

38:57.600 --> 38:58.920
of prepared Alex you know we keep

38:58.920 --> 39:00.500
hearing oh you got to see this I was

39:00.500 --> 39:02.190
prepared to think yeah sure guys it's a

39:02.190 --> 39:03.190
rock

39:03.190 --> 39:04.190
well that's the thing is that I didn't

39:04.190 --> 39:06.090
think you know tried to think that I

39:06.090 --> 39:08.070
couldn't think that no it's very it's

39:08.070 --> 39:10.890
very odd and they did come across

39:10.890 --> 39:12.540
something that looked extremely

39:12.540 --> 39:15.520
anomalous to my and I will say untrained

39:15.520 --> 39:17.580
eye because I haven't looked at a lot of

39:17.580 --> 39:20.180
side-scan solar but what they showed was

39:20.180 --> 39:22.490
this triangular shaped rock which is not

39:22.490 --> 39:24.820
that odd but that it has a perfect

39:24.820 --> 39:26.740
inscribed triangle on the top of it well

39:26.740 --> 39:30.230
now now you got something odd you know

39:30.230 --> 39:32.290
that's a horse of a different color so

39:32.290 --> 39:35.830
and it was a very diving depth is it

39:35.830 --> 39:39.610
possible Alex or Craig that it was at

39:39.610 --> 39:41.440
one time exposed there's that too deep

39:41.440 --> 39:43.460
I think it's tinny it seems like it's

39:43.460 --> 39:45.840
little too deep my board erosion yeah

39:45.840 --> 39:47.740
rosin that's a big factor especially on

39:47.740 --> 39:49.410
the south side that's where the most of

39:49.410 --> 39:52.440
the erosion occurred so even though the

39:52.440 --> 39:54.990
might have only been five feet lower

39:54.990 --> 39:58.010
you know erosion will beaten in a way

39:58.010 --> 39:59.710
over time so it could have been out

39:59.710 --> 40:01.970
further yeah that was at high tide yeah

40:01.970 --> 40:04.570
all right we gotta have a look at that

40:04.570 --> 40:10.530
yes we need to we need to do further

40:10.530 --> 40:12.700
exploration we want to do a jump

40:12.700 --> 40:15.670
tomorrow sir what's the visibility we're

40:15.670 --> 40:17.440
looking at the moment from what we were

40:17.440 --> 40:19.520
getting today if we do it at high tide

40:19.520 --> 40:21.700
you'll probably have ten ten maybe

40:21.700 --> 40:24.000
fifteen feet if you're lucky if it's

40:24.000 --> 40:26.590
just all by itself then maybe it'd be

40:26.590 --> 40:28.100
easier to see so we're gonna have to be

40:28.100 --> 40:30.100
right on it

40:30.100 --> 40:33.609
could Rick Marty and the rest of the

40:33.609 --> 40:36.500
team be less than 24 hours away from

40:36.500 --> 40:38.460
locating a critical new piece of

40:38.460 --> 40:40.800
evidence a piece that could help them

40:40.800 --> 40:43.380
finally solve the Oak Island mystery all

40:43.380 --> 40:44.640
right guys look I'm used to being

40:44.640 --> 40:46.390
disappointed on Oak Island but we're

40:46.390 --> 40:47.790
gonna put eyes on that tomorrow and

40:47.790 --> 40:49.470
we're not gonna be disappointed - that -

40:49.470 --> 40:55.560
the dive as another day ends on Oak

40:55.560 --> 40:56.650
Island

40:56.650 --> 40:59.590
several questions remain and several

40:59.590 --> 41:03.530
harsh realities appear certain because

41:03.530 --> 41:06.310
although Rick Marty and the team are

41:06.310 --> 41:09.000
better equipped and better prepared than

41:09.000 --> 41:10.960
any of the searchers that came before

41:10.960 --> 41:15.580
them there is still much work to do many

41:15.580 --> 41:19.800
riddles to solve and many more holes to

41:19.800 --> 41:22.580
do and whether or not their efforts end

41:22.580 --> 41:25.760
in success or failure is up to the

41:25.760 --> 41:27.260
island

41:27.260 --> 41:31.050
to decide next time on the curse of Oak

41:31.050 --> 41:33.030
Island Christopher Columbus was

41:33.030 --> 41:35.820
responsible for the ark coming to old

41:35.820 --> 41:36.820
Island

41:36.820 --> 41:38.890
I went down they got to the bottom I saw

41:38.890 --> 41:40.770
the stone I swear that northerly bearing

41:40.770 --> 41:42.660
and I came across another big triangle

41:42.660 --> 41:43.660
Rock

41:43.660 --> 41:47.460
you good okay let's go two dives away

41:47.460 --> 41:50.350
from getting answers to a 40-year quest

41:50.350 --> 41:52.630
he's under finished 10x what's in the

41:52.630 --> 41:54.420
bottom Michael do you copy
