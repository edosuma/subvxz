11:49.970 --> 11:52.712
Huh, not baby's, they fine.

11:52.755 --> 11:53.930
Did you hear me about the card?

11:53.974 --> 11:55.758
-I did.
-Can you look?

11:55.802 --> 11:57.934
I still have David's present.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.763
Yes, we need to
come over, I know.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.809
Do you think you could
look for the card please?

12:02.852 --> 12:04.767
I wouldn't know where to begin.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.856
-It's important.
-Found it!

12:09.380 --> 12:11.469
No, that's junk mail, J.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.602
But it says security!

12:13.645 --> 12:15.778
For a god damn home
security system?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.998
Why you cursin'
at that child like that?

12:18.041 --> 12:20.957
You gotta look for that
card, Ma, I need it!

12:21.001 --> 12:22.742
For what?

12:26.267 --> 12:27.703
For unemployment.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.139
You lost your job?

12:29.183 --> 12:31.794
That's usually why
someone gets unemployment.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.796
You didn't tell me
that you lost your job.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.842
I'm telling you now, all right?

12:35.885 --> 12:38.845
And my rent is already overdue,
so can you please look?

12:38.888 --> 12:41.586
Well, that's just
irresponsible.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.501
-What happened?
-It don't matter,

12:43.545 --> 12:44.851
it happened.

12:44.894 --> 12:47.592
You bein' willful again Gloria?

12:47.636 --> 12:49.072
You takin' pleasures?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.770
No, I did not.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.989
All who have sinned
under the law

12:53.033 --> 12:54.643
will be judged by the law.

12:54.686 --> 12:57.951
You remember that when
you look at those baby's.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.960
Gloria, you hear me?

13:07.612 --> 13:09.310
Gloria!

13:10.354 --> 13:12.792
[bell ringing]

13:18.145 --> 13:20.364
You ever gonna tell me
about the Hurston rep?

13:20.408 --> 13:21.975
You know I'm gonna keep asking.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.847
It was-- it was good.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.808
The sob story at the
projects with working mother

13:28.851 --> 13:30.722
and the weight of
the world on you,

13:30.766 --> 13:33.856
may have been honey for the
Hurston rep but it's debasing

13:33.900 --> 13:36.206
and reflects poorly
on all of us.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.515
It went good.

13:40.558 --> 13:41.733
How was mass?

13:41.777 --> 13:43.170
I killed it.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.998
"Your interest in the
preservation of the manatee

13:45.041 --> 13:46.782
is commendable, Marissa."

13:46.826 --> 13:47.957
You know what they called them?

13:48.001 --> 13:48.915
Called what?

13:48.958 --> 13:50.568
-Manatees.
-No.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.005
Sea cows.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.355
I knew that going in 'cause
I like all that stuff

13:54.398 --> 13:57.184
'cause it comes natural to me,
marine biology.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.707
Good for you.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.883
I already got a Rec letter
from Mr. Merryash.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.624
Gonna hit up Dr. WT next.

14:02.667 --> 14:03.843
You talk to her?

14:06.149 --> 14:07.107
Not yet.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.848
The deadline's in two weeks, DJ.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.415
You need a letter,
and Dr. WT's not so easy.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.331
You gotta work for it.
What are you waiting for?

14:21.425 --> 14:24.124
I'll collect everyone's
papers when the time's up.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.386
You didn't need to bring it.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.040
Yeah, I did.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.445
[boy]
Where you get that money, J?

14:41.489 --> 14:43.926
[JG] Love my kicks,
don't get me wrong.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.711
My mama, she need help keepin'
the roof over our heads.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.931
And you know what I say,
Dai ain't around,

14:48.975 --> 14:51.891
it's time for me
to step up, be a man.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.111
[knocking]

14:56.765 --> 14:59.115
Damn!
Ain't nobody work around here!

15:08.690 --> 15:10.126
Hold up.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.128
You want him to know who's
rent you're payin' right?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.391
Shit. I do.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.698
Ain't nobody's gonna know
by this chicken scratch.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.450
Details my man,
it's all in the details.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.542
-Team work.
-Team work.

15:35.673 --> 15:38.938
Sometimes a man gotta do,
what a man gotta do.

15:56.651 --> 15:57.869
Fuck!

16:03.484 --> 16:05.094
What you doin' barefoot?

16:06.226 --> 16:07.183
I took care of things mama.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.751
-Took care of what?
-Rent.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.014
What are you talkin' about,
Jonathan?

16:12.058 --> 16:13.146
Where are your shoes?

16:13.189 --> 16:15.061
You don't gotta worry,
I'm on it.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.497
Okay you stop right now.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.499
What is all this nonsense
comin' out your mouth?

16:18.542 --> 16:20.109
Ain't nonsense, mama.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.981
Sold my Brons to Raynan.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.200
You what?

16:25.071 --> 16:27.029
I paid the rent
with the proceeds.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.380
Hold on.

16:30.424 --> 16:33.166
You went out all by yourself
and sold your shoes?

16:33.209 --> 16:34.645
Uh-huh.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.908
And paid rent with it?

16:36.952 --> 16:38.171
Uh-huh.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.650
Johnathan!

16:39.694 --> 16:41.087
You can't be out
there runnin' around

16:41.130 --> 16:43.567
doin' crazy ass
things like that.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.047
But you were sellin' stuff.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.570
But that was for food!

16:46.614 --> 16:48.094
Why can't I help with the rent?

16:48.137 --> 16:49.443
Those shoes were a gift.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.749
Your grand daddy
gave those to you, J.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.490
And you said I ain't
even need new shoes.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.145
And they hurt my
back heels anyway.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.760
You just gave the
cash to Mrs. Hertrude.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.154
Nah, I put the money in the box.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.983
What about a receipt?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.289
Office was closed.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.814
Listen.

17:12.857 --> 17:17.166
Don't be doin' anything like
that again you understand?

17:17.210 --> 17:18.733
You got a big heart, baby.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.605
You all heart, I give you that.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.912
I'll let Mrs. Hertrude know.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.044
And lets...

17:25.087 --> 17:29.352
And lets hold tellin' Dai
for now okay?

17:30.310 --> 17:31.876
Snitches get ditches.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.326
You practicin' for
your interview?

17:46.935 --> 17:48.110
No.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.199
What you already got
your rec for Hurston?

17:50.243 --> 17:52.288
No, I just didn't do it yet.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.986
-Why not?
-I'm just busy, is that okay?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.425
Whoa, why are you so jumpy?

18:00.253 --> 18:03.125
I'm fine.
See y'all later.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.128
Obviously he ain't fine.
Why did you bring up Hurston?

18:06.172 --> 18:08.261
Not everything's
about you stupid!

18:13.962 --> 18:16.921
Jonathan said he put
the money in the box!

18:16.965 --> 18:18.662
That's on you Glo,
there's no money

18:18.706 --> 18:19.881
in there, I just checked.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.404
I don't got time for this shit.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.927
My son doesn't lie!

18:22.971 --> 18:24.712
You didn't know your son
pissed the sheets either

18:24.755 --> 18:26.409
so maybe your son do lie.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.107
And you ain't got no receipt.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.761
Office was closed!
Y'all allowed to leave early.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.112
If your boy grown enough
to pay the rent,

18:33.155 --> 18:34.983
he need to know
to get a receipt.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.333
You have any idea how much
money get stolen out that box?

18:37.377 --> 18:39.292
I hear it all, Glo!
I ain't got time.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.554
Don't be tryin' to
sell me this shit.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.470
You know me, Mrs. Hertrude.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.211
You know what it's
like bein' a mother.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.473
You raised three babies.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.518
You know what it take to
put food on the table,

18:48.562 --> 18:49.606
keep a roof over their heads.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.218
I just-- I'm havin' a hard time.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.263
I'm tryin' to get
benefits since I fell

18:54.307 --> 18:55.699
and you know what that is.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
It's hard doin'
all this by myself,

18:57.223 --> 18:59.050
raisin' these boys and
keepin' it all together.

18:59.094 --> 19:03.272
But I'm doin' my best and
I swear, we paid the rent.

19:03.316 --> 19:07.363
If you could do anything,
anything it'd mean the world.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.452
Gloria, where we at?

19:09.496 --> 19:12.542
Homestead Village.
We all poor.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.241
We all tryin' to keep
a roof over our heads.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.374
Rent is due Monday.
Simple as that.

19:18.418 --> 19:21.464
Or else it's outta my hands
and you on the street.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.797
Hold up,
you paid rent with cash?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.233
Yeah, so?

19:51.277 --> 19:52.234
I took care of things.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.757
So? You can't pay in cash.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.368
People steal from
that box all the time.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.021
That's why we pay rent
with money orders.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.066
I did good, Dai.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.372
Did good? That money gone!

19:59.415 --> 20:01.112
Where'd you get that
type of cash anyway?

20:01.156 --> 20:02.418
I sold my shoes to Raynan.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.463
Raynan?

20:03.506 --> 20:05.378
How bout you ease up, Dai?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.293
-He meant well.
-It don't matter what he meant.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.251
You sit there and let that
happen. What was you thinkin'?

20:09.295 --> 20:10.861
Don't forget who you
talkin' to David, hear me?

20:10.905 --> 20:13.473
He in it now with Raynan,
which means I'm in it now.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.649
Don't you see that?
Where were you?

20:15.692 --> 20:17.303
Right here?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.435
Lookin' up and down for
my social security card

20:19.479 --> 20:22.830
tryin' to get unemployment
and find whatever I can

20:22.873 --> 20:25.180
to pawn so we don't
end up on the street!

20:25.224 --> 20:26.442
That's where my head is at!

20:26.486 --> 20:28.444
Where were you, Dee?

20:28.488 --> 20:29.315
Huh?

20:29.358 --> 20:30.968
Out there runnin' the rips?

20:31.012 --> 20:32.187
Rips?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.275
What, where you gettin' that?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.321
What happened to
puttin' everything

20:35.364 --> 20:36.974
into gettin' to Hurston?

20:37.018 --> 20:39.063
I'm takin' care of this end
and you takin' care of yours.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.151
I am!

20:40.195 --> 20:41.327
Don't lie to me.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.371
I ain't lyin'!

20:42.415 --> 20:43.416
So I'm the lie?

20:43.459 --> 20:44.591
No.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.332
What's this?

20:48.769 --> 20:51.337
[ominous music playing]

21:05.264 --> 21:07.135
Just some strong
aspirin somebody

21:07.178 --> 21:09.137
gave mama for her pain, baby.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.279
Can you do somethin' for me?

21:21.758 --> 21:25.458
Will you call the
school and tell them

21:25.501 --> 21:29.418
I want more sessions with
the counselor, Dr. Bree.

21:29.462 --> 21:33.292
The school counselor?
Really, why?

21:33.335 --> 21:36.295
I'm trying not to
worry like you said.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.384
I just-- I need help.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.907
Please Ma.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.302
Just tell them that
you're okay with it.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.654
I'll make the call.

21:48.829 --> 21:50.309
Thank you.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.399
Be back soon.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.704

21:58.491 --> 22:00.754
I'm gonna go to a meetin' later.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.192
Okay.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.642
[clapping]

22:22.819 --> 22:24.255
What the fuck you want?

22:24.299 --> 22:25.300
He there?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.910
Might be.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.564
Send him out.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.828
You the boss now?
Get up here.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.700
Tell Raynan to come

22:33.743 --> 22:36.398
Hey, nigga, I told you bout
shoutin' up folks whereabouts.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.748
You think this is a game?

22:38.792 --> 22:40.576
A'ight cool.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.752
-Imma thump your ass.
-Eh, hold up.

22:42.796 --> 22:47.235
Brother Dai don't wanna make
the walk, we accommodate.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.237
[laughs]

22:49.280 --> 22:50.543
What's up, king?

22:50.586 --> 22:53.372
My mama on that shit
I brought here last week?

23:05.906 --> 23:08.996
This between you and me,
stay the fuck from
my mom and JG.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.780
Whoa, whoa.

23:10.824 --> 23:11.955
What you high for Dai?

23:11.999 --> 23:13.392
This ain't how Sky ran things,

23:13.435 --> 23:14.610
ain't the way it's
gonna be run now.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.960
My family ain't
part of this, ever.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.835
Ain't no pressure, bruh.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.794
Mrs. Glo and me,

23:24.838 --> 23:26.927

23:26.970 --> 23:29.495
Then little man come my way,

23:29.538 --> 23:31.932

23:33.020 --> 23:35.631
Ain't tryin' to stir nothin'.

23:35.675 --> 23:36.980
Just helped, Dai.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.548
That's it.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.596
Your people ain't my interest.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.076
Commerce is.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.470
Buildin' business and if
business come to me then--

23:48.514 --> 23:49.689
-Stay away from--
-Man look,

23:49.732 --> 23:51.386
they could either get
it from me or you.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.040
I prefer you too.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.476
I asked you.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.348
I made you my offer.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.795
Dai.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.928
Where you goin', bruh?

24:27.030 --> 24:29.598
What the fuck that boy
do with that money?

25:38.101 --> 25:39.755
[ominous music playing]

25:50.723 --> 25:52.812
[Sky]
You gotta make a choice, Dai.

25:52.855 --> 25:55.684
Stay or leave.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.687
Sink or swim.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.950
Choose now.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.038
Dai!

26:02.082 --> 26:03.779
[panting]

26:15.791 --> 26:17.445
[Gloria]
You print it while I wait right?

26:17.488 --> 26:18.707
Yes.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.189
If I was able to
make out anything

26:22.232 --> 26:24.626
on your birth certificate.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.673
It's just a little frayed
is all.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.545
Your name is illegible.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.938
You got a U.S. passport?

26:31.981 --> 26:33.679
A passport? No.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.245
The license only
proves your identity.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.639
New laws require to prove
your citizenship as well.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.207
Look, you can read
most of my name.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.513
There's the G, there's L.

26:42.557 --> 26:45.778
My eight year old spilled
milk on it, but if you look
real good, it says "Young".

26:45.821 --> 26:49.477
See? Gloria Young,
that's me, same as my license.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.784
Legally it's unacceptable.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.877
Look, here's my pay stub,
my social security number

26:57.920 --> 26:59.661
is right...

26:59.705 --> 27:02.142
there by my name.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.448
You need a certified copy

27:04.492 --> 27:05.754
of your original
birth certificate.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.277
Once you submit the
form you should have it

27:07.321 --> 27:08.627
by mail in four weeks.

27:08.670 --> 27:09.932
But I can't wait that long.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.847
Then check off the box
for expedited service.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.371
For $20 it's guaranteed
to arrive in two weeks.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.069
Where am I supposed to get $20?

27:16.112 --> 27:17.679
I need my card today.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.767
Hey, that's not our problem.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.074
You heard the man,
get out the line.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.642
I am not finished.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.252
Yeah you are.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.602
This ain't the day.

28:10.819 --> 28:16.216

28:21.047 --> 28:22.222
Ma'am.

28:23.179 --> 28:24.877
David.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.356
Is everything all right?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.880
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry to bother you but,

28:27.923 --> 28:30.143
I was wondering
if my mother called.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.885
She was gonna okay more
sessions with Dr. Bree.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.845
Come in, David. Sit.

28:45.593 --> 28:48.988
-How are things at home?
-Fine.

28:49.031 --> 28:52.513
-I was just wondering--
-Are the basics being met?

28:52.556 --> 28:54.645
Electricity, food.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.826
Yes.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.002
Did you have breakfast
this morning?

29:03.045 --> 29:04.090
I did.

29:05.308 --> 29:06.788
Are you sure?

29:09.225 --> 29:10.574
Yes, ma'am.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.186
This is a safe space.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.753
You can be honest with me.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.885
Yeah, I know.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.714
Telling me what's
really going on

29:19.758 --> 29:22.325
wouldn't be a betrayal
to your mother,

29:22.369 --> 29:24.675
I hope you know that.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.286
Okay.

29:26.329 --> 29:29.942
I'm here to help, not to
cast judgment on anyone.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.987
Especially to those
who need help the most.

29:32.031 --> 29:34.947
Principal Fallow, you annoying
as fuck, you know that?

29:37.036 --> 29:40.822
That's true, thank you,
Principal Fallow.

29:42.606 --> 29:43.956
Your mother did call.

29:43.999 --> 29:47.002
I'll discuss with
Dr. Bree and I'll let you know

29:47.046 --> 29:49.788
if I decide to authorize
further sessions.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.791
All right, thank you.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.968
Close the door on
your way out please.

30:12.027 --> 30:17.859
Some days it's as if God
pushes me right up to my edge.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.949
You got your family,
you got your job,

30:20.993 --> 30:24.779
you got your health,
you maybe even got your sanity.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.217
And then it all falls.

30:29.523 --> 30:33.092
And no matter what you do,
you slippin' off.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.311
And instead of getting
a helping hand,

30:35.355 --> 30:37.879
you get kicked down harder.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.841
I was about to do somethin'...

30:45.060 --> 30:46.757
real bad.

30:48.542 --> 30:49.891
My disease.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.113
It was scratchin' hard at me.

30:55.723 --> 30:59.422
But then I got myself over here.

30:59.466 --> 31:01.990
It's when you think...

31:02.034 --> 31:03.949
life's goin' along fine,

31:04.688 --> 31:06.777
I'm solid.

31:06.821 --> 31:09.302
Nothin's gonna take me down.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.347
It happens.

31:13.262 --> 31:14.916
They take everything.

31:16.744 --> 31:21.227
And it's diggin' into my soul
in a way that's not bearable.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.969
Cuttin' off my breath,
that's when I lose

31:24.012 --> 31:26.928
my connection with God.

31:26.972 --> 31:30.801
I find myself face
to face with the devil.

31:31.802 --> 31:35.023
I want what he's got to offer.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.807
I can taste it.

31:37.591 --> 31:41.116
I'm this close to takin' a pill.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.292
From the boss that
wants to fuck me,

31:43.336 --> 31:45.381
and the landlord that
wants to kick me out,

31:45.425 --> 31:47.209
and the government
that wants to screw me

31:47.253 --> 31:49.255
out of my benefits,
and all the fuckin' long ass

31:49.298 --> 31:51.648
days that wanna put
me in an early grave.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.825
Even my neighborhood that
wants to steal my children

31:54.869 --> 31:58.133
right out from under me
as they look at me in my eye.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.311
See, if I would of
took that Oxy,

32:02.355 --> 32:05.836
I coulda let Jay have
his way with me,

32:05.880 --> 32:07.664
kept my job,

32:07.708 --> 32:11.494
even gotten a few days off
to heal from my fall.

32:11.538 --> 32:13.757
I wouldn't need no help
from public service,

32:13.801 --> 32:16.630
no worries about my kids.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.806
I'm an addict.

32:18.849 --> 32:23.898
I want to check out
of life sometimes

32:24.464 --> 32:26.248
to survive my life.

32:27.162 --> 32:31.166
Some days it feels
like staying alive

32:31.210 --> 32:35.127
is more important
than staying clean.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.177
You don't need a principal's
recommendation for Hurston.

32:42.221 --> 32:43.874
You will write me one?

32:43.918 --> 32:45.789
Do you think you warrant one?

32:45.833 --> 32:48.923
Yes, I do.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.882
So do I.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.760
It didn't seem to matter.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.370
Yes, I do.

33:01.414 --> 33:02.981
You doin' it again.

33:03.851 --> 33:06.071
Talkin' to yourself.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.990
You already got your
Rec from Dr. WT?

33:12.033 --> 33:13.382
Locked in.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.123
Funny thing is I didn't
even need Mr. Merryash.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.560
The application lady
saw Dr. WT's name,

33:17.604 --> 33:19.345
said the second was optional.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.132
Hey, David.

33:24.176 --> 33:27.092
You need to be over by
nine for church Sunday.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.745
Yeah, okay.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.747
I love church. This Sunday?

33:30.791 --> 33:33.098
We can ride together.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.318
This ain't about you.

33:36.362 --> 33:40.148
It's a mans day, we're goin'
because we're men, relax.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.441
Yes, it's fine,

34:12.485 --> 34:14.139
I'll let him know.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.055
Dr. Bree is waiting for you.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.100
You can leave class
a few minutes earlier,

34:19.144 --> 34:21.320
provided all your work is done.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.454
Is that what you
wanted to ask about?

34:28.022 --> 34:29.415
Yes, ma'am.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.076
[sighs]

34:55.354 --> 34:57.182
You need to tell me
all about this new man

34:57.225 --> 34:59.227
you been seein', Max.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.755
You okay, girl?

35:05.799 --> 35:08.497
I uh... you know.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.196
A little clammy, Glo.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.677
Feel steady, I got you.

35:20.727 --> 35:24.078
Ain't no shame in needin'
some help sometimes, Max.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.340
Won't cost you much.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.942
[Dr. Bree]
I heard those Hurston reps
can be pretty tough.

36:01.985 --> 36:04.423
Do you think you
made a connection?

36:05.163 --> 36:06.860
We were good.

36:06.903 --> 36:10.385
What did you talk about?
Did you learn anything useful?

36:10.429 --> 36:11.821
[Dr. Woods-Trap's Voice]
I need to understand

36:11.865 --> 36:13.345
what is going on with you.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.434
[Sky] You supposed to
be focused on school.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.349
-High school Interviews--
-Don't look at that--

36:17.392 --> 36:19.002
-[Gloria] No job, I got fired.
-[Raynan] Brought that pharmo

-[Gloria] Where were you, Dee?

36:21.222 --> 36:22.963
[Sky] Don't do it, Dai.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.182
What are your feelings
on the complicated

36:24.225 --> 36:27.010
dynamics between
Cersei and Jamie?

36:27.054 --> 36:28.447
Huh?

36:28.490 --> 36:31.058
Why did you want
extra sessions, David?

36:31.537 --> 36:33.234
Uh, well...

36:35.541 --> 36:37.064
To help.

36:37.107 --> 36:39.240
Hearin' me talk to myself
is somehow helpful?

36:43.766 --> 36:45.246
I don't know.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.249
Maybe some food will help.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.167
A Kit Kat from the
vending machine okay?

36:55.082 --> 36:56.301
Sure.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.305
I'll be right back.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.292
-Glo.
-I know, the rest is coming.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.295
I got management
on my ass everyday.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.601
I get that, I do.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.124
But I'm good for the money,
you know I am.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.821
Please just take it.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.781
I promise I'm good for the rest.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.174
Please, Mrs. Hertrude.

37:48.222 --> 37:51.269
You got two weeks.

37:53.445 --> 37:55.621
I'll go get your receipt.

38:00.495 --> 38:03.324
Sometimes a man do
what he gotta do

38:03.368 --> 38:05.413
but it still ain't enough.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.675
Word.

38:18.339 --> 38:20.428
Proud leader!

38:22.125 --> 38:24.345
Not a good time.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.565
For what?
Celebration?

38:28.262 --> 38:31.221
Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

38:31.265 --> 38:32.222
Ring a bell?

38:32.266 --> 38:33.659
There ain't no crown.

38:33.702 --> 38:34.790
You kiddin' me?

38:34.834 --> 38:37.358
Now you slayed that Hurston rep.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.447
Got her eyes right off of Seren.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.580
And his head don't seem like
it's in the game anyway.

38:41.623 --> 38:42.537
It doesn't matter.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.670
It's Woods-Trap,
she all over me.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.802
I need that letter.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.543
She just doin' what she do, Dee.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.546
She gotta be up on you
for excellence sake.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.461
She got your back.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.376
You don't know that.

38:55.420 --> 38:56.682
Of course I do.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.248
The letter will come.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.554
You just need to stay focused

38:59.598 --> 39:02.557
and be your best self at school.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.386
Well I got stuff too like
gettin' the rent paid.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.780
Hey, hey, what Gloria say?

39:07.823 --> 39:09.738
Let her worry about that.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.654
You just stay in the
comfort zone and you good, hero.

39:12.698 --> 39:14.177
I ain't good!

39:14.221 --> 39:15.396
When you gonna--

39:24.362 --> 39:26.451
You keep thinkin' about it.

39:27.321 --> 39:28.670
That night.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.370
I told you to run.

39:36.504 --> 39:39.420
My youth,

39:39.464 --> 39:40.813
you gotta a land in sight.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.337
Focus on that straight
line to Hurston.

all about yesterday.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.645
You're a man of war.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.864
Your salvation
is far from here.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.258
Not in this game!

39:51.301 --> 39:52.607
Leave me the fuck alone!

40:25.466 --> 40:30.079
[Sky] Once you make your choice
Dai, you gotta live with it.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.864
Own it, believe it.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.650
Even get others to believe it.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.568
You can't fool everybody.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.266
Or maybe you can.

40:43.310 --> 40:47.310
