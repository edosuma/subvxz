00:06.423 --> 00:09.092
Previously on Stargate SG-1:

00:09.218 --> 00:13.430
Every System Lord in attendance will
be permitted to bring one human slave.

00:13.514 --> 00:17.809
We need someone who speaks fluent
Goa'uld. Someone who is not Jaffa.

00:17.893 --> 00:22.022
You will wait until all the System Lords
have arrived and then you will use this.

00:22.147 --> 00:26.193
These two liquids mixed together
form a most virulent poison.

00:26.276 --> 00:31.198
All you have to do is prick him... once.
He'll believe you to be his slave Jarren.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.910
All that is left of Martouf
lives on in Lantash.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:47.965 --> 00:50.384
This has gone on long enough.

00:50.968 --> 00:54.346
We must determine who is
responsible for these attacks.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.517
Lieutenant?

01:01.812 --> 01:03.188
Oh, my God.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.066
- Sarah's here.
- Sarah...

01:06.692 --> 01:10.988
You mean Osiris?
Did she recognise you?

01:11.154 --> 01:15.784
I don't know. I think so, but she didn't
tip her hand and I don't know why.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.373
Daniel Jackson.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.420
You're a rather long way
from home, aren't you?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.261
And now the conclusion.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.142
What are you doing here?

01:40.267 --> 01:43.937
What, me? Right now? Nothing.
Why? You have something in mind?

01:45.522 --> 01:47.482
Insolence.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.819
Tell me what subversions
you are a part of,

01:51.361 --> 01:54.615
or I will bleed you dry.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.836
May I help you?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.465
Who are you?

02:11.840 --> 02:15.260
I am Lord Yu's servant.
This is my master's quarters.

02:18.639 --> 02:23.519
You have the wrong room. I've gotten lost
myself. These corridors all look the same.

02:29.024 --> 02:33.320
If you don't mind my asking, isn't it
forbidden to take weapons to the summit?

02:33.445 --> 02:36.114
If you speak of it again,

02:36.240 --> 02:39.660
I promise they will be your last words.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.589
Jacob! Still there?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.259
Yeah. What happened?

02:56.552 --> 02:59.221
Osiris and I kinda got into it.
The chemical worked.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.015
Why didn't you just release the poison?

03:05.060 --> 03:08.313
- Daniel?
- Because that would have killed Sarah.

03:08.981 --> 03:13.277
There's gotta be a way to save her.
You've taken symbiotes out ofhosts.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.320
We'd have to get her out of there.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.491
- So?
- Daniel, there's a biggerpicture here.

03:19.616 --> 03:23.120
You have to release
the poison. Do it now.

03:24.371 --> 03:28.667
You know what's at stake. No single
person's life is more important.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.879
Complete yourmission.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.752
- The crystals.
- What?

04:53.877 --> 04:57.297
- The Tok'ra use crystals to form tunnels.
- Yeah, we know that.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.092
So we can use them to make more.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.053
- Where are they?
- The lab.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.139
All right, you wait here. Teal'c, with me.

05:06.515 --> 05:11.270
Sir, see if you can find one of those Tok'ra
communicators. We may need it.

05:14.690 --> 05:18.068
Weakness is
befalling the System Lords.

05:18.485 --> 05:22.364
If this... tenuous alliance crumbles,

05:22.698 --> 05:27.327
it will leave the Goa'uld vulnerable to
threats that exist outside this galaxy.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.582
We must put aside our differences

05:32.124 --> 05:34.877
and individual struggles for power

05:35.043 --> 05:38.881
to strengthen the Goa'uld
and ensure our supremacy

05:39.006 --> 05:41.550
over those who threaten our domination.

05:42.718 --> 05:47.389
You speak of grand principle,
but you have no official seat here.

05:47.514 --> 05:52.144
Then I ask you to... officially
recognise my status here.

05:55.439 --> 05:59.985
What do you offer as support for your
claim for position as System Lord?

06:00.819 --> 06:02.863
Nothing.

06:07.117 --> 06:11.079
I'm here to represent the vote of another.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.336
Whom do you serve?

06:17.461 --> 06:19.505
- Anubis.
- What?

06:19.630 --> 06:22.299
- You lie!
- He is dead!

06:22.424 --> 06:26.803
That was what you assumed after
you attempted to murder him.

06:28.764 --> 06:32.684
Was it not enough that he was
banished from the System Lords?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.145
Never to be allowed to return!

06:35.270 --> 06:40.776
That was long ago, and only one
System Lord remains from that time.

06:42.861 --> 06:46.448
He has sent me to ask
that you accept him back.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.618
Or...

06:51.036 --> 06:54.289
place yourselves at his mercy.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.354
Bodies are gone.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.206
We got company.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.206
- Jacob?
- Yeah. Are you ready?

08:18.373 --> 08:20.375
- Not exactly.
- Dammit, Daniel.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.586
I was gonna do it, then Osiris said

08:22.711 --> 08:26.173
she was here representing
another Goa'uld named Anubis.

08:26.298 --> 08:30.427
- He is dead.
- No. He wants to rejoin the System Lords.

08:30.511 --> 08:34.306
Why now? Where has he been
for the last thousand years?

08:34.431 --> 08:38.393
I dunno. We suspected a new Goa'uld
was on the rise. We didn't know which.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.688
- Turns out he's not so new.
- If it is really Anubis...

08:41.772 --> 08:46.151
Killing the System Lords here would
just let him take over. You said yourself,

08:46.235 --> 08:49.947
a bunch of warring System Lords
is better than one all- powerful one.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.282
You do not know how badAnubis is.

08:52.407 --> 08:56.870
He was banished by the System Lords
because his crimes were unspeakable,

08:56.954 --> 09:00.749
- even to the Goa'uld.
- Yeah. So guess what. Mission's off.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.921
Anubis has not waited this long
just to return to the System Lords.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.299
- There must be more going on.
- So?

09:09.383 --> 09:12.553
You must stay and find out what it is.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.763
If you can.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.364
They should be back by now.

09:32.489 --> 09:37.035
I'm sure they're OK. They'll be
back soon. How are you doing?

09:38.287 --> 09:40.956
- It's very strange.
- I know.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.083
It's like...

09:44.751 --> 09:48.964
I suddenly know everything
about someone else's life.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.301
Two other people, actually.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.012
I hear his thoughts every now and then.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.727
But he's using all his strength
to try and save me.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.399
Sounds like they're coming
around for another run.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.286
- What a joke.
- What?

10:22.247 --> 10:24.625
I'm gonna die on my first mission.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.793
You're not.

10:27.169 --> 10:32.508
Major, even if the symbiote fixes what's
wrong with me, we're never getting out.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.220
Sure we are.
You've read our mission files.

10:36.595 --> 10:40.641
We go through the gate, get into
trouble, get out of it and go home.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.185
Tell that to Major Mansfield.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.817
OK, forget the pep talk. You knew
what you were signing up for.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.654
Yeah.

10:53.779 --> 10:58.158
You got the assignment because you're
strong, both physically and mentally.

10:58.992 --> 11:04.122
Give the symbiote inside you a chance.
He needs you as much as you need him.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.291
Do not...

11:39.449 --> 11:42.703
The base has been infiltrated.
Many dead Tok'ra were found,

11:42.786 --> 11:47.082
- as well as three humans of the Tauri.
- Allies of the Tok'ra.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.961
The few Tok'ra we captured died before
we could extract any information.

11:51.086 --> 11:55.883
However, six Jaffa were found dead
outside what we believe to be a lab.

11:56.008 --> 12:01.597
- Three were killed by Tauri weapons.
- Then there are survivors still free.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.932
It would seem so.

12:04.433 --> 12:09.104
- What about the chemical weapon?
- No evidence of it has been found.

12:09.605 --> 12:13.233
The Tok'ra computers were
sabotaged before our troops arrived.

12:13.358 --> 12:18.113
- Then find the missing survivors.
- The tunnels are extensive, my lord.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.492
But we will not fail you.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.890
He loves you, Major.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.978
That's one of the reasons
he was fighting to live.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.397
He just wanted you to know.

12:54.983 --> 12:58.320
The symbiote I carried
was Martouf's mate.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.615
Martouf and I became
close friends because of it.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.537
I'm telling you, he loves you.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.748
As much as he once loved Jolinar.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.877
He regrets what happened.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.756
How the host ultimately died.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.136
He doesn't want you to feel responsible.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.931
It's OK.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.897
It's getting hard to breathe.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.733
Yeah.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.861
Hang on.

14:31.163 --> 14:34.500
Carter? Carter,
ifyou hearme, respond.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.087
Sir, we're here. The tunnel collapsed.

14:39.213 --> 14:42.216
- We're trapped.
- Yeah, we noticed that.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.598
Listen, how do we use these
crystals to move the walls?

14:52.768 --> 14:57.439
Each crystal is designed to create
a different section of tunnel.

14:58.732 --> 15:04.154
Small square ones will
create short straight openings.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.117
Sir, use a small square one
if you've got it.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.414
Roger that. Got a small square one there?

15:18.794 --> 15:22.381
There are several of both
square and rectangular design.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.425
Small?

15:25.759 --> 15:29.680
If they use the wrong one they
could collapse the tunnel in on us.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.893
Sir, make sure you use the right crystal.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.105
It's perfectly square.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.816
Looks square to me.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.911
Sweet.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.755
- Thank you.
- You bet. Any time.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.843
- Did you find a Tok'ra communicator?
- No. No, we didn't.

16:07.968 --> 16:11.847
Many Jaffa troops search the tunnels.
They'll be here soon.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.933
Use the long rectangle.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.037
Nice!

16:35.162 --> 16:37.623
You should seal the tunnel behind us.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.438
Time has taught him... humility.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.192
And respect for the union
of the System Lords.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.069
- You take me for a fool.
- Please.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.406
The Goa'uld have warred with each
other since the beginning of time.

17:12.532 --> 17:17.246
Anubis has been amassing power
so that he may win back your respect.

17:17.371 --> 17:22.209
He is also no fool. He knows you would
not accept him back without need.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.545
We do not need Anubis!

17:24.670 --> 17:27.673
Dissent and disbelief

17:27.798 --> 17:31.301
previously unseen
in the ranks of the Jaffa.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.513
Infiltration and subversion by the Tok'ra.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.726
And you cannot continue to ignore
the threat of the humans on Earth.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.399
How many must die?

17:46.066 --> 17:49.236
How many dominions must fall?

17:49.319 --> 17:54.324
And how can we continue to claim
to be gods if we cannot act like them?

17:55.617 --> 17:59.997
The Tauri cannot be allowed
to triumph again and again.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.250
The treaty with the Asgard
protects their planet.

18:03.375 --> 18:08.463
- From the System Lords.
- Who must enforce it upon all Goa'uld.

18:08.589 --> 18:12.384
But not from one who has been
dead for a thousand years.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.553
What do you propose?

18:19.641 --> 18:22.978
Accept my vote on behalf of Anubis,

18:24.605 --> 18:28.025
and before he resumes
his position amongst you...

18:29.651 --> 18:32.321
he will destroy Earth.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.500
- How many of those things do we have?
- Six.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.128
We can't stay down here for ever.
We're out of water.

18:48.212 --> 18:51.715
The Jaffa will not rest
until they have found us.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.386
- Why do you say that?
- If they intended simply to kill the Tok'ra,

18:56.470 --> 19:00.599
they have weapons that could have
destroyed this facility from space.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.354
Using troops suggests
they're looking for something.

19:05.479 --> 19:08.065
- The poison.
- We can't let them have it.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.236
If it comes down to it,

19:12.361 --> 19:15.948
we'll have to destroy the crystal
that contains the formula.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.700
They gotta stop looking for us eventually.

19:18.826 --> 19:23.038
Even if they stop searching, they will
never leave the Stargate unguarded.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.083
Well, Jacob and Daniel
will be back sooner or later.

19:26.208 --> 19:30.671
The Tok'ra will have broadcast
an alert telling them to stay away.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.802
They will assume we died
along with the other Tok'ra.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.471
Maybe.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.308
Without any way of communicating,
how will they find us?

19:45.269 --> 19:47.312
Let's keep moving.

19:57.865 --> 20:00.200
- Jacob?
- Yeah, go ahead.

20:01.535 --> 20:06.081
They're voting whether to accept Anubis
back. He has a plan to attack Earth.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.710
- Did you get any details?
- Osiris didn't say.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.713
Hey, here's a question foryou.

20:13.714 --> 20:17.217
Why are the Goa'uld allowing
their slaves to hear everything?

20:17.342 --> 20:21.972
I'm not sure. We suspected they would
kill the slaves when the summit was done.

20:22.764 --> 20:27.644
- That's not important enough to tell me?
- You were going to kill all the Goa'ulds.

20:29.229 --> 20:32.774
- I'm not doing that any more.
- True. What's your point?

20:32.900 --> 20:35.903
There's a big vat oflive symbiotes here.

20:38.447 --> 20:42.910
- So they're not killing the slaves after all.
- Not by the looks ofit.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.912
Shut down the shield generator.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.663
- I'll get you out.
- Not yet.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.875
Ifyou're caught and the poison
falls into the wrong hands...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.793
I won't get caught.

21:00.636 --> 21:05.015
Who among us accepts the return
of Anubis to the System Lords?

21:28.914 --> 21:31.166
The vote need not be unanimous.

21:31.625 --> 21:35.671
By a count of six to one, Anubis is
awarded the state of System Lord

21:35.754 --> 21:39.174
and welcomed back among those
that lead the Goa'uld.

21:39.299 --> 21:42.135
Osiris will be allowed
to vote on his behalf.

21:42.261 --> 21:44.680
You shall not regret this.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.433
May we rule for ever.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.812
There is much to discuss in that regard.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.189
But first...

21:55.107 --> 21:58.110
Lo ko harak...

22:01.154 --> 22:03.198
sha Mel.

23:08.514 --> 23:11.767
There does not appear
to be any Jaffa pursuing us.

23:11.850 --> 23:16.563
Good. We haven't heard bombers
in a while. Let's try the surface.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.900
Elliot? Can you hear me?

23:21.485 --> 23:25.072
How do we use the crystals
to tunnel up to the surface?

23:25.572 --> 23:27.449
Surface?

23:27.533 --> 23:30.953
Yeah, we wanna get up there
and get some water.

23:32.204 --> 23:34.248
The diamond.

23:36.708 --> 23:41.505
You said the Tok'ra are probably
transmitting an alert to warn others away.

23:42.256 --> 23:46.009
Long- range sensors.
Detect incoming ships.

23:46.885 --> 23:49.805
Transmit signals to deep space.

23:49.888 --> 23:53.684
Could we reprogram one
to signal Jacob and Daniel?

23:56.979 --> 23:59.022
It's possible.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.191
Where are they?

24:01.441 --> 24:03.485
Four of them.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.822
25 miles from the gate.

24:06.947 --> 24:11.076
Each is due north, south, east and west.

24:11.493 --> 24:15.414
- I figure we're three miles from the gate.
- Give or take.

24:15.539 --> 24:18.876
Either way, we have to get
to one of those sensors.

24:34.850 --> 24:36.894
Let's go.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.946
- You knew they were gonna eat them?
- Yes.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.658
They do it every night for as
long as the summit continues.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.953
What do you think will happen
when this is over? To us, I mean.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.331
That is between you and your master.

24:57.456 --> 25:01.335
Don't you think it's strange that
they let us see their sacred rituals?

25:01.460 --> 25:04.004
Hear their most secret conversations?

25:04.129 --> 25:07.466
I've been in the service
of my master for 24 years.

25:07.799 --> 25:10.636
In that time I have seen and heard

25:10.761 --> 25:13.305
many, many things.

25:13.889 --> 25:15.933
Have you not?

25:16.475 --> 25:21.188
My master's regular lo'taur could not
be here. I took his place on short notice.

25:21.313 --> 25:23.357
I see.

25:25.817 --> 25:30.656
- May I speak honestly with you?
- Have you not been honest prior to now?

25:30.781 --> 25:32.825
Yes, of course.

25:32.950 --> 25:37.830
What I mean is, can I trust you that this
conversation will remain between us?

25:42.292 --> 25:44.962
I believe the Goa'uld are powerful beings

25:45.504 --> 25:49.967
that use humans like us as hosts. I believe
they use their power to portray gods,

25:50.050 --> 25:53.387
so that the masses will
follow and serve them.

25:54.555 --> 25:56.598
I agree.

25:57.391 --> 25:59.893
- You know this to be true?
- Yes.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.771
- And yet you still serve?
- As do you.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.235
Yes, but my fear is, when this is over,

26:08.360 --> 26:11.947
my master will not wish me to spread
the secrets that I have learned,

26:12.072 --> 26:14.032
and will kill me to prevent it.

26:14.158 --> 26:17.828
You would not be here if
your master did not trust you.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.997
True.

26:20.455 --> 26:23.542
But what if they do not care
what we see and hear because

26:23.625 --> 26:27.921
when they are done eating symbiotes
they plan to put the leftovers in us.

26:28.005 --> 26:30.757
You should only be so fortunate.

26:30.841 --> 26:32.968
Excuse me?

26:33.093 --> 26:35.846
I have served my master
so well for so long

26:35.971 --> 26:40.767
in the hope that one day he would
grant me the honour of implantation.

26:40.893 --> 26:43.562
- The honour?
- Yes.

26:44.563 --> 26:48.066
Endless pleasure, and
the power of the Goa'uld.

26:49.443 --> 26:53.739
The chance to one day ascend
to the rank of System Lord.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.833
I lost two motherships in that battle.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.295
Your strategy was obviously weak.

27:13.717 --> 27:16.470
Your master has exacted
tolls from each of us.

27:17.679 --> 27:22.059
Yet you all voted to welcome
him back into the fold.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.895
The power he has regained
is worthy of respect.

27:24.978 --> 27:29.608
What does he offer to repay the damage
he has done in garnering his forces?

27:29.691 --> 27:33.320
Anubis owes the System Lords nothing.

27:33.445 --> 27:38.367
- He joins you for the good of all Goa'uld.
- Anubis may have grown strong,

27:38.492 --> 27:43.705
but he does not outweigh the
collective power of the System Lords.

27:45.040 --> 27:50.546
What deed does Anubis offer as evidence
of the dedication you claim on his behalf?

27:50.796 --> 27:53.382
Speak now or leave us.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.471
As I have said before,

27:59.596 --> 28:04.226
Anubis believes that the greatest threat
to the Goa'uld is that from within.

28:06.353 --> 28:08.480
As we meet here,

28:08.605 --> 28:12.025
that threat is being greatly weakened.

28:17.447 --> 28:22.369
Over the years we have all lost
a great deal to the infiltrations,

28:22.911 --> 28:27.291
subversions and rebellious
acts of the Tok'ra.

28:29.418 --> 28:33.463
Today will henceforth be known

28:34.256 --> 28:37.843
as the day the blood
of the Tok'ra ran free,

28:38.260 --> 28:41.346
and their rebellion ended for good.

29:01.909 --> 29:06.872
- There are gliders patrolling the area.
- We got 20 miles to go in that direction.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.667
Over this terrain I figure we can
make a mile every 15 minutes.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.713
That should hopefully put us at
the sensors in under nine hours.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.596
Excuse me.

29:22.721 --> 29:27.851
I wish to pass on a message from my
master, Yu, to Osiris. He wishes to meet.

29:36.485 --> 29:39.238
- Jacob?
- What the hell's going on, Daniel?

29:39.321 --> 29:44.409
Anubis knows the location ofthe Tok'ra
base. Osiris says he's attacking now.

29:44.535 --> 29:48.455
- Get to the shield. I'm coming in.
- Forget that. I have a newplan.

29:55.003 --> 29:59.299
- What are you doing?
- I'm stealing Yu's cargo ship.

30:00.259 --> 30:03.637
- I can fly out from inside the shield, right?
- Yes. Why?

30:05.347 --> 30:08.684
- Cos I'm taking Osiris with me.
- Do you have her now?

30:08.767 --> 30:11.854
- No. I'm working on it.
- The chemical you're carrying

30:11.937 --> 30:15.274
could be the only way we can
stop the attack on Revanna.

30:15.357 --> 30:18.944
Yeah, and Osiris could
eventually lead us to Anubis.

30:19.069 --> 30:22.447
Then you can do your best to
take the snake out and save Sarah.

30:22.573 --> 30:25.659
- How are you gonna fly that ship?
- I've flown a mothership.

30:25.784 --> 30:28.245
How hard can this be?

30:37.462 --> 30:41.758
- Where is my lo'taur, Jarren?
- I have not seen him, Your Lordship.

30:42.259 --> 30:45.179
My lord? Forgive me.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.223
I faithfully serve my master, Baal,

30:48.348 --> 30:52.394
and therefore hear whatever
I say with certain suspicion.

30:52.978 --> 30:57.357
I believe it is my duty to tell you that
your new lo'taur cannot be trusted.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.761
Stop!

31:48.033 --> 31:51.453
How unfortunate that Lord Yu
could not trust his slave.

31:51.870 --> 31:56.750
Each was mortally wounded in the fight
as the slave attempted to kill his master.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.628
Sarah, it's me. Daniel.

32:16.603 --> 32:17.813
No!

32:27.406 --> 32:30.826
- That better be you, Daniel.
- Get me out ofthis thing.

32:31.410 --> 32:33.662
I'm on my way.

32:43.881 --> 32:46.049
- Major?
- Hold up.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.218
Yeah?

32:52.347 --> 32:55.684
I better tell you how to
reprogram the sensor.

33:17.164 --> 33:19.833
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

33:20.751 --> 33:23.212
- What happened?
- I had her, then Yu had me,

33:23.337 --> 33:25.464
- then I had to get out...
- The poison?

33:25.589 --> 33:27.966
- It's right here.
- Good man.

33:35.891 --> 33:40.270
- How long's it gonna take to get there?
- Pushing the engines, six hours.

33:40.395 --> 33:44.358
- But we may already be too late.
- I know this may seem unimportant now,

33:44.483 --> 33:49.655
but I might as well tell you. I figured out
why the Goa'uld population isn't growing.

34:00.833 --> 34:02.459
Colonel?

34:12.719 --> 34:14.596
Nice.

34:16.764 --> 34:20.601
My lord, a cargo ship was
detected exiting hyperspace

34:20.726 --> 34:24.773
but it cloaked immediately.
Its current location is unknown.

34:26.440 --> 34:31.612
Deploy a squadron of gliders. Have them
scan the atmosphere for disturbances.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.701
And if the ship even attempts to
land on the planet, shoot it down.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.956
What about the survivors?

34:43.583 --> 34:46.753
They have not been found, my lord.
The search continues.

34:46.837 --> 34:51.967
Then join the search yourself. And
if you do not find either the formula

34:52.092 --> 34:56.013
or a living Tok'ra who can tell
me of it, do not bother to return.

35:06.023 --> 35:09.359
- We're getting an alert from the surface.
- What's it say?

35:09.484 --> 35:11.945
"The base has been compromised. "

35:13.447 --> 35:15.908
"Assume no survivors. "

35:19.953 --> 35:21.997
We should go.

35:33.717 --> 35:36.178
That's it. I'm done.

35:37.262 --> 35:41.975
- How do we know if it's working?
- I guess if someone comes to rescue us.

35:47.856 --> 35:50.275
We're getting another signal.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.444
What is it?

35:53.028 --> 35:55.072
It's an SOS.

35:55.614 --> 35:59.451
- It has to be Jack or Sam.
- Hopefully both, and more.

35:59.785 --> 36:01.245
Let's ride.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.924
What the hell...?

36:17.469 --> 36:19.638
We've been hit.

36:20.389 --> 36:22.516
Our cloaking mechanism failed.

36:22.641 --> 36:27.187
They must have seen our heat signature
as we passed through the atmosphere.

36:30.816 --> 36:33.360
I can't shake'em.

36:33.485 --> 36:36.029
I'm diverting power to the shields.

36:36.363 --> 36:40.033
We're losing altitude fast.
Hang on, Danny. We're going in.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.002
There.

36:54.298 --> 36:57.050
This is gonna be rough.

37:23.702 --> 37:25.746
Stay with Elliot.

37:43.889 --> 37:45.516
Hey.

37:46.725 --> 37:48.769
You OK?

37:50.062 --> 37:52.105
Not really.

37:54.691 --> 37:59.530
You'd think a race advanced enough to
fly in spaceships would have seat belts.

37:59.655 --> 38:04.117
- We just prefer not to crash.
- Come on. We gotta get out of here.

38:19.258 --> 38:21.510
- Are you injured?
- I'll live.

38:22.302 --> 38:25.472
- How's our ride?
- It's not going anywhere fast.

38:34.815 --> 38:36.859
Dad!

38:38.235 --> 38:40.988
- You all right?
- Yeah. Looks worse than it is. You?

38:41.071 --> 38:43.115
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:43.615 --> 38:46.368
- How's Elliot?
- He's in rough shape.

38:46.451 --> 38:51.623
He got injured in a cave- in. Lantash went
into him to save him but it's not working.

38:52.916 --> 38:58.922
We might save the cargo ship, but not
before this area's swimming with Jaffa.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.758
Those gliders definitely
made our position.

39:01.842 --> 39:05.971
- We cannot escape through the Stargate.
- We still have this.

39:06.054 --> 39:10.184
As much area as that will cover,
I don't think it'll spread to the Stargate.

39:10.309 --> 39:13.770
If we release it here
it'll kill you, Elliot and Teal'c.

39:13.896 --> 39:16.899
Then I gotta figure out
a way to get it to the gate.

39:16.982 --> 39:20.861
It's suicide. You're assuming
the Jaffa won't shoot you on sight.

39:20.986 --> 39:24.156
Given the lack of cover
and the size of the Jaffa army,

39:24.239 --> 39:26.909
even I could not get to
the Stargate undetected.

39:26.992 --> 39:29.369
Leave it here with me.

39:34.750 --> 39:38.462
- What good's that gonna do?
- Leave here and hide.

39:41.089 --> 39:42.966
The...

39:43.050 --> 39:45.802
The Jaffa will find me.

39:46.762 --> 39:50.807
I'll tell them I know the formula.
They'll take me to the gate.

39:51.683 --> 39:55.395
He is correct. He will be taken
to the base camp by the Stargate

39:55.521 --> 39:59.733
- before being sent to the mothership.
- Won't they search him first?

40:01.527 --> 40:05.364
Then I'll... Then I'll set off the weapon.

40:07.324 --> 40:09.868
Take out as many as I can.

40:20.754 --> 40:22.798
Please.

40:23.632 --> 40:26.176
We're both gonna die.

40:26.885 --> 40:29.137
I cannot save us.

40:31.139 --> 40:33.392
But there's a chance

40:33.517 --> 40:35.978
that we can save you.

40:38.188 --> 40:40.607
What about Elliot?

40:42.234 --> 40:44.695
It doesn't make sense

40:46.155 --> 40:50.033
for any of you to risk your
lives trying to save me.

40:54.204 --> 40:56.456
Gimme the device.

41:27.321 --> 41:29.364
Now go.

41:31.700 --> 41:34.244
They'll be here soon.

41:41.668 --> 41:43.921
He's happy now.

41:46.465 --> 41:49.301
He just wanted you to know how he felt.

41:51.512 --> 41:53.555
I do.

41:54.014 --> 41:57.684
And I'll never forget him. Or you.

42:03.607 --> 42:06.151
Ground forces will not be far behind.

42:07.194 --> 42:09.446
Sam, we gotta go.
