freak-out.

Every year it's kind of scary.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.367

>> KENDALL: And, like, take the

10:37.367 --> 10:39.500

you kind of do that.

10:42.633 --> 10:46.066
myself like, "Suck my stomach
in, stick my butt out, chin

10:46.066 --> 10:51.333
down, arms down this way."
Why do we freak out?

look good.

dating scene recently,

11:30.533 --> 11:33.567
and she is planning a little
birthday surprise tonight.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.800
I don't really know the details
of tonight.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.033
She's, like, doing this whole,
like, exchange, like, she's

11:38.033 --> 11:41.266
putting, like, a hotel key into
this wallet.

11:41.266 --> 11:43.834
Never known Kourtney to be this
giddy ever in my life.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.200
I've never known Kourtney to
plan anything.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
It's so cute, though, to see her
this giddy.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.200
>> JONATHAN: Just be fun.
You're, like, so (bleep) weird

11:50.200 --> 11:51.533
about it.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, okay.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.533
>> JONATHAN: Just like that.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, okay.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.600
>> KHLOE: I know a little bit
about this guy.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.633
I'm not gonna ask a lot of
questions, 'cause she's super

11:57.633 --> 11:59.633
awkward.
>> KIM: Don't, yeah.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.633
>> KHLOE: No, and she, like,
will shut down...

12:01.633 --> 12:03.934
Right, don't ask, don't tell
policy.

12:03.934 --> 12:06.000
>> KOURTNEY: Or do I put it all
in the middle part?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.900
>> KHLOE: No, you want him to
see it.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.467
>> KOURTNEY: I'm not even
putting it in the box.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.233
You're just gonna hand it.
>> KHLOE: Put it in the box.

12:11.233 --> 12:12.633
What's wrong with you?
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, okay, okay.

12:12.633 --> 12:15.266
>> KHLOE: Now it looks like you
got it for free.

12:15.266 --> 12:17.667
And, like... (laughs)
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.667
>> KHLOE: She's handing him
what-- just that thing?

12:19.667 --> 12:21.667
He'll be like, "What the (bleep)
are you doing?"

12:21.667 --> 12:23.200
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, no bow on the
box, right?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.767
>> JONATHAN: Come on, with the
bow-- nobody does bows.

12:24.767 --> 12:26.767
>> KOURTNEY: Okay. Okay.
>> SYDNEY: All right, okay.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.767
>> KOURTNEY: All right, I'll
text you the address.

12:28.767 --> 12:31.000
>> SYDNEY: Okay.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay, thanks, Syd.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.066
>> JONATHAN: Watch, disaster,
that you don't find him.

12:33.066 --> 12:35.066
>> KOURTNEY: Right?
>> JONATHAN: The whole thing's a

12:35.066 --> 12:36.800
(bleep) mess.
>> KHLOE: Or she gives it to

12:36.800 --> 12:38.800
somebody else by accident.
>> JONATHAN: Right, oh, my God.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.133
>> KHLOE: Kourtney's like...
"Hey!" (laughs)

12:42.133 --> 12:44.333

what I could eat that's not

12:48.934 --> 12:51.100
gonna make me... my stomach
stick out.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.100
I have this really tight dress
to wear tonight.

12:53.100 --> 12:57.100
>> KOURTNEY: Hey, happy Cinco de
Mayo, guys!

12:57.100 --> 12:59.467
>> KRIS: That's all you got?
It's not necessary to be late in

12:59.467 --> 13:01.900
life.
>> KIM: Will you read that?

13:01.900 --> 13:05.967
You're gonna die.
What do I say?

13:05.967 --> 13:07.967
>> JONATHAN: You should lau...
you should laugh, at this point.

13:07.967 --> 13:09.967

"LOL"?

13:12.100 --> 13:14.333

>> KHLOE: Like, why can't you
just be normal?

13:16.333 --> 13:18.567
>> JONATHAN: She's got a real
insecurity problem lately, and

13:18.567 --> 13:20.567
you should have a major
conversation with her.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.734
Here, Kim, Kim, I'm gonna
freaking kick you-- like, stop.

13:22.734 --> 13:24.734
>> KIM: You should have seen me
at the Met.

13:24.734 --> 13:27.934
If you think this is bad,
Jonathan, I was in the car, on

13:27.934 --> 13:29.934
the way there, going, "I'm gonna
(bleep) my pants, I'm gonna

13:29.934 --> 13:31.934
die."
>> KHLOE: Like, what happened to

13:31.934 --> 13:33.600
you?
>> KIM: You know what it was,

13:33.600 --> 13:35.467
honestly?
That Mexico trip really (bleep)

13:35.467 --> 13:37.467
me up.
>> KOURTNEY: The cellulite?

13:37.467 --> 13:39.700
>> KIM: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: To say that you're not

13:39.700 --> 13:43.266
gonna know anyone in the Met...
>> KIM: I know.

13:43.266 --> 13:46.700
>> KHLOE: Kim looked absolutely
amazing at the Met Ball, and

13:46.700 --> 13:49.266
even though I would hope those
pictures would give her, like,

13:49.266 --> 13:52.233
another surge of confidence and
maybe make her realize, "Okay,

13:52.233 --> 13:54.600
it was just bad photos in
Mexico," it seems like the

13:54.600 --> 13:57.567
Mexico pictures are
never-ending, and I think it's

13:57.567 --> 14:01.467
just making her think about
Paris again, the response to her

14:01.467 --> 14:04.066
being robbed.
She was being mocked and made

14:04.066 --> 14:07.400
fun of for this really traumatic
thing that happened to her, and

14:07.400 --> 14:09.867
I feel like that only was more
traumatic.

14:09.867 --> 14:12.033
And now her having these
pictures come out-- you know,

14:12.033 --> 14:14.867
everyone has another reason to
kind of ridicule her and

14:14.867 --> 14:17.400
mock her.
It's one of the few times she's

14:17.400 --> 14:21.100
been seen back out, and this is
how she gets treated, and it's

14:21.100 --> 14:23.333
not fair and it's really cruel.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.033
>> KOURTNEY: Do you want kids to
be showered and in pajamas when

14:29.033 --> 14:31.200
they come to you?
>> KHLOE: Sure.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.600
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.
And then should... is 6:00 good

14:34.600 --> 14:37.734

>> KHLOE: Yeah.

14:37.734 --> 14:40.166
>> KRIS: So you're babysitting
tonight?

14:40.166 --> 14:43.734
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.
>> KOURTNEY: Just that?

14:43.734 --> 14:47.867
>> JONATHAN: A little more
exciting.

14:47.867 --> 14:51.000
>> KHLOE: I'm super secretive
when it comes to me, like, newly

14:51.000 --> 14:53.500
dating someone.
But I'm also not sitting at,

14:53.500 --> 14:56.400
like, a table, you know,
planning little surprise

14:56.400 --> 14:58.567
gestures.
Kourtney's basically saying,

14:58.567 --> 15:01.467
"Let me dangle this carrot right
in front of your face and hope

15:01.467 --> 15:04.433
you don't ask me any questions."
Like... it's a... Uh, it's very

15:04.433 --> 15:06.700
passive-aggressive.
Like, I feel like, "Does she

15:06.700 --> 15:08.734
want us to ask her?"
'Cause she's doing this right in

15:08.734 --> 15:10.734
front of our face.
But then it's Kourt, so we can't

15:10.734 --> 15:16.367
ask her, 'cause she's so
socially awkward.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.600
Kourtney, did you wash your face
today?

15:18.600 --> 15:22.633

this story?

15:25.066 --> 15:28.000
I guess it got so much attention
for them, they just won't le...

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000

Do you have my phone?

36:16.400 --> 36:17.967
>> KOURTNEY: Hold on.
Yeah, I'm not done.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.834
>> KIM: What are you doing?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.100
>> KIM: Kourt?
I need to get my phone.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.100
Do you have my phone?
>> KOURTNEY: Hold on.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.100
Yeah, I'm not done.
>> KIM: What are you doing?

36:31.100 --> 36:33.367
I thought you were calling the
kids.

36:33.367 --> 36:36.967
TMZ?
Daily Mail?

36:36.967 --> 36:39.734
Blocking them?
>> KOURTNEY: You can never go on

36:39.734 --> 36:41.734
these now.
>> KIM: Why?

36:41.734 --> 36:46.266
>> KOURTNEY: Because you... it
consumes you and it affects you.

36:46.266 --> 36:51.867
>> KIM: You deleted my apps?
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, did I?

36:51.867 --> 36:54.633
>> KIM: So, she tried to block
me.

36:54.633 --> 36:57.100
>> KHLOE: Yeah, but... it's,
like, the healthiest thing for

36:57.100 --> 36:59.400
you.
She's doing it, like, not from a

36:59.400 --> 37:01.266
malicious place; she's trying
to help you.

37:01.266 --> 37:02.934
>> KIM: I'm not, like, a
lunatic.

37:02.934 --> 37:05.233
>> KHLOE: Yeah, but you have
been letting these things get

37:05.233 --> 37:07.467
into your soul.
don't want to see things

37:07.467 --> 37:09.033
every day.
Like, Kendall even says when she

37:09.033 --> 37:11.300
has, like, a problem, she, like,
erases the whole Twitter app

37:11.300 --> 37:13.333
from her phone.
>> KOURTNEY: You just need to

37:13.333 --> 37:15.333
live your life and be happy.
>> KIM: Don't you think it's

37:15.333 --> 37:17.333
good to be aware and be in the
know?

37:17.333 --> 37:20.734
>> KOURTNEY: Why do you need to
see this nonsense?

37:20.734 --> 37:23.533
You can see your tagged photos
on Instagram-- that's it, that's

37:23.533 --> 37:25.633
all you need to see.
>> KIM: I look at them for news,

37:25.633 --> 37:27.667
too.
>> KOURTNEY: News about what?

37:27.667 --> 37:29.667
What news are you learning?
Daily Mail--

37:29.667 --> 37:31.667
that's how I learn all my news.
>> KOURTNEY: No.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.166
>> KIM: Of what's going on in
the world.

37:33.166 --> 37:35.667
>> KOURTNEY: No. I don't read
any news, and I'm fine and I'm

37:35.667 --> 37:39.200
happy.
>> KHLOE: I totally get, like,

37:39.200 --> 37:42.000
how hurtful all the comments
are, and it could get to you and

37:42.000 --> 37:44.066
it, like, stays with you all
day.

37:44.066 --> 37:46.600
But out of anyone, you've always
been the one that, like, that

37:46.600 --> 37:48.767
stuff doesn't bother you, and
you're like, "Who cares?"

37:48.767 --> 37:52.934
Like, it's so... small in, like,
the grand scheme of life, and

37:52.934 --> 37:55.900
these people, who are they?
And, like, today's news, like,

37:55.900 --> 37:59.133
no one thinks about tomorrow.
>> KIM: I mean, you guys are

37:59.133 --> 38:02.500
right; I do need to just, like,
let this not bother me and just,

38:02.500 --> 38:08.200
like... not be a thing.
>> KHLOE: We were just trying to

38:08.200 --> 38:11.834
eliminate any extra negativity
from your life; that's all we

38:11.834 --> 38:14.100
were trying to do.
>> KIM: I mean, I do understand

38:14.100 --> 38:16.567
that you guys were just trying
to help me.

38:16.567 --> 38:18.834
Like, I get that.
I don't need this negativity in

38:18.834 --> 38:20.934
my life.
>> KHLOE: I agree.

38:20.934 --> 38:23.200
So let Kourtney block your
phone.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.400
>> KIM: I'll live like this for,
like, two days and see how I

38:25.400 --> 38:26.967
feel.
>> KOURTNEY: And then I'll

38:26.967 --> 38:28.700
unblock you.
>> KHLOE: I'm sure you'll still

38:28.700 --> 38:37.800
weasel your way somewhere.

I think it's amazing that

Khloe has come home to
spend some time with me, and I'm

38:52.300 --> 38:56.934
feeling guilty as (bleep).
Khloe, this is so exciting.

date.

Es la verdad.

39:08.667 --> 39:13.367
horny.
My God, Khloe, stop.

>> MAN: Oh-ho-ho!
A walkie-talkie?

39:15.700 --> 39:18.567

up than to surprise her with a

39:18.567 --> 39:21.633
wine tasting?
>> WAITRESS: This is our

39:21.633 --> 39:23.867
Saddlerock Rose and Zinfandel.
>> KRIS: Nice.

39:23.867 --> 39:26.333
>> WAITRESS: And you're gonna
get strawberry on the nose,

39:26.333 --> 39:28.767
watermelon on the palate, with a
cranberry finish.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.767
>> KRIS: Looks so good.
>> WAITRESS: Cheers.

39:30.767 --> 39:32.900
>> KHLOE: What was she saying,
"strawberries on the nose"?

39:32.900 --> 39:35.266
>> KRIS: I have no idea what
that language was.

39:35.266 --> 39:37.166
>> KHLOE: And a "cranberry
finish."

39:37.166 --> 39:41.734

you talking about?

39:41.734 --> 39:44.633

Oh.

39:44.633 --> 39:47.867
Could we also get a glass of
Chardonnay?

39:47.867 --> 39:53.300
A wine of a different color.
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.367

39:55.367 --> 39:59.233

Oh, this is so fun!

40:05.633 --> 40:08.800
>> KRIS: We're drinking a lot of
wine.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.467
Are you getting confused?
Because that's your side of the

40:11.467 --> 40:14.233
table.
We should do prank calls.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.233
>> KHLOE: What?
>> KRIS: We should do prank

40:16.233 --> 40:18.633
calls.
Hey, Siri.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.633
>> KHLOE: No, no. Here.
>> KRIS: Siri!

40:20.633 --> 40:22.633

>> KRIS: Siri!

40:22.633 --> 40:24.633
>> KHLOE: You got to... you
can't just talk to them.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.767
>> KRIS: Siri, could you please
call the hotel?

40:26.767 --> 40:29.700
(line rings)
Oh.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.867
>> CARA: Good afternoon.
This is Cara.

40:31.867 --> 40:34.266
How can I direct your call?
>> KRIS (British accent): Hello.

40:34.266 --> 40:37.900
Can I please have Khloe
Kardashian's room?

40:37.900 --> 40:39.934
>> CARA: I don't see that I have
her registered as a guest here

40:39.934 --> 40:42.900
at the hotel.
>> KRIS: Oh, that's wild!

40:42.900 --> 40:47.133
I think she's under a... I don't
know, like, another name.

40:47.133 --> 40:50.033
I think it's something like
Funny Bunny.

40:50.033 --> 40:53.767
Or Fred Flintstone.
That's the two that I know she

40:53.767 --> 40:57.233
normally goes under.
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God, your prank

40:57.233 --> 41:01.533
calls, honestly, are the best.
You have me crying.

41:01.533 --> 41:06.100
>> KRIS: Hi. I'm calling from
London's Daily Pastry and Cake.

41:06.100 --> 41:12.133
I was just trying to follow up
on a story that you provided all

41:12.133 --> 41:16.600
of Khloe Kardashian's pastries
for Thanksgiving a couple of

41:16.600 --> 41:19.266
years back.
>> MAN: Okay.

41:19.266 --> 41:22.734
>> KRIS: I heard that it was the
delicious pumpkin pie.

41:22.734 --> 41:25.800
>> MAN: The pumpkin pie, yeah,
it's our... it's our seasonal,

41:25.800 --> 41:29.467
um, pie that we have at
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

41:29.467 --> 41:31.600
>> KRIS: What else is seasonal?
>> MAN: We also have a

41:31.600 --> 41:35.233
strawberry rhubarb pie that's
only, uh, in stock... it's only

41:35.233 --> 41:37.700
in season during the summer for
some reason.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.700
>> KRIS: I buy strawberries all
year round.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.867
Is it just the rhubarb, or,
like...

41:41.867 --> 41:43.367
>> MAN: Yeah, I think it's just
the rhubarb.

41:43.367 --> 41:45.700
>> KRIS: Okay, can I just ask
you a personal question?

41:45.700 --> 41:47.700
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.
>> KRIS: So, how do you spell

41:47.700 --> 41:49.467
"rhubarb"?
(Khloe laughing)

41:49.467 --> 41:52.033
>> MAN: It's, uh, it's all mixed
within the batter for the pie.

41:52.033 --> 41:55.467
>> KRIS: Do you happen to know
of a toe-ologist?

41:55.467 --> 41:59.834
My foot is killing me.
>> MAN: No, I've never heard of

41:59.834 --> 42:01.934
that. (chuckles)
>> KRIS: Are you sure?

42:01.934 --> 42:03.934
>> MAN: Yeah.
>> KRIS: Okay, well, maybe I'll

42:03.934 --> 42:06.633
ask the concierge.
>> MAN: No problem.

42:06.633 --> 42:08.633
>> KRIS: Okay, well, thank you
so much.

42:08.633 --> 42:10.633
You've been delightful.
>> MAN: No problem, ma'am.

42:10.633 --> 42:12.700
I hope you have a good day.
>> KRIS: Okay. Thanks.

42:12.700 --> 42:15.500
>> KHLOE: He gets an "A" for
customer service, seriously.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.033
(Kris laughs)
He literally needs a raise.

42:18.033 --> 42:20.333
>> KRIS: The guy's delightful.
The next time you come into

42:20.333 --> 42:23.166
town, I'm gonna make a much
better effort to try to see you

42:23.166 --> 42:25.367
much more and clear my schedule
completely.

42:25.367 --> 42:28.667
>> KHLOE: I'm not trippin', boo.
I'm good, but I get it, you're a

42:28.667 --> 42:31.467
boss lady.
Mom.

42:31.467 --> 42:34.800
(Kris clears throat)
Mom?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.600
>> KRIS: Yeah?
>> KHLOE: It's 2:00.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.600
>> KRIS: Cheers to that.
>> KHLOE (laughs): Cheers.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.533
Cheers to that.
That's what this episode's gonna

42:43.533 --> 42:47.133
be called-- "Cheers to That."
Oh, my God.

42:47.133 --> 42:49.300
(line ringing)
>> FARNAZ: Hello?

42:49.300 --> 42:51.567

43:00.567 --> 43:02.900
Hello?
>> KRIS: Bonnie.

43:02.900 --> 43:07.400
(quiet laughing)
>> FARNAZ: Ha-ha-ha.

43:07.400 --> 43:13.734
I got to go.
Hello?

43:13.734 --> 43:16.033
>> KIM: On the next episode...
>> KOURTNEY: What are Kendall

43:16.033 --> 43:18.033
and I gonna do alone?
>> KHLOE: Kourt thinks Kendall

43:18.033 --> 43:19.934
doesn't like her.
>> KENDALL: I've never gotten

43:19.934 --> 43:22.767
this drunk off of wine.
(laughs)

43:22.767 --> 43:24.767
>> KIM: I'm gonna go to
Khloe's house, totally pack for

43:24.767 --> 43:26.633
her.
>> JONATHAN: This is like five

43:26.633 --> 43:28.734
animals in one-- a zebra, a
pelican...

43:28.734 --> 43:31.033
>> KIM: Cheesy as (bleep).
>> KHLOE: This is not the

43:31.033 --> 43:32.734
suitcase I packed.
>> KIM: Everyone's worried

43:32.734 --> 43:34.734
about you.
out of

43:34.734 --> 43:36.734
control.
>> KHLOE: This cycle is not

43:36.734 --> 43:38.400
beneficial to anybody.
>> KOURTNEY: No, I don't want

43:38.400 --> 43:41.066
the kids to see him like this.
