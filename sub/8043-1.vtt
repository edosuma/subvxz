01:51.584 --> 01:53.542
(Cat screeches)

02:35.042 --> 02:36.626
(Knocks on door)

02:39.542 --> 02:41.542
(Hinges creek)

02:46.292 --> 02:48.251
Mrs. Hooper?

02:50.667 --> 02:53.626
Mrs. Hooper,
I brought your groceries.

02:56.584 --> 02:58.126
Hello?

03:00.126 --> 03:01.376
Mrs. Hooper!

03:01.501 --> 03:04.459
I'm gonna leave
the groceries right here.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.209
I'll collect next week, OK?

03:07.251 --> 03:09.042
(Clattering)

03:09.417 --> 03:10.876
Hello?

03:12.167 --> 03:14.167
Mrs. Hooper?

03:27.042 --> 03:28.459
Sick!

03:50.209 --> 03:54.667
Mrs. Hooper.
It's me, the grocery boy.

04:01.626 --> 04:02.917
(Faint thud)

04:12.501 --> 04:14.251
(Thud)

04:14.376 --> 04:16.250
Mrs. Hooper?

04:23.209 --> 04:24.751
(Screams)

04:39.001 --> 04:41.084
(Lightning cracks)

04:41.126 --> 04:45.001
Our sister has gone to her rest
in the peace of Christ,

04:45.042 --> 04:47.167
the faith and hope
and eternal life.

04:47.209 --> 04:48.209
May the Lord
now welcome her

04:48.251 --> 04:51.209
to the table of God's children in heaven.

04:51.251 --> 04:53.876
May we have a moment
of silent prayer?

04:53.917 --> 04:56.167
(Woman sobbing)

04:56.209 --> 04:59.251
Elizabeth wasn't crazy, Roger.

05:00.084 --> 05:01.334
A little senile, maybe, but...

05:01.376 --> 05:05.334
just wasn't like her to go and do
something like that.

05:05.376 --> 05:12.167
- Thank you, Mr. Jones. I appreciate that.
- Now, my wife, she's crazy.

05:12.209 --> 05:17.251
But, your aunt,
she was a good woman.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.501
(Indistinct chatter)

05:24.542 --> 05:26.751
OK, everybody,
back up a few steps, would you?

05:26.792 --> 05:28.917
Give Mr. Cobb some room
to sign your books.

05:28.959 --> 05:29.959
Aah!

05:30.001 --> 05:33.209
"To my good friend, Johann."

05:33.251 --> 05:36.001
- Here you go.
- Great book, man.

05:36.042 --> 05:38.126
Mr. Cobb, we've been waiting a long time.

05:38.167 --> 05:40.584
Can you tell me
what your next book is going to be about?

05:40.626 --> 05:42.084
Um...

05:42.126 --> 05:44.626
It's about my personal
experiences in Vietnam.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.917
- Uh, the war?
- Yeah, that's right.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.834
Oh, uh...

05:49.876 --> 05:51.084
Great.

05:53.251 --> 05:56.001
Are you really married
to Sandy Sinclair?

05:56.042 --> 05:58.459
I was, but we're divorced now.

05:58.501 --> 06:01.209
I just wanted to tell her
that I think she's a marvelous actress.

06:01.251 --> 06:03.209
She's a very talented young lady.

06:03.251 --> 06:04.209
I'll tell her that.

06:04.251 --> 06:06.084
- It's a great book.
- Thank you.

06:06.126 --> 06:08.042
- I like your hair.
- Thanks.

06:08.084 --> 06:09.667
I've never missed her show,

06:09.709 --> 06:11.542
not once, since
it's been on the air.

06:11.584 --> 06:15.001
- She is so enchanting to watch...
- Who are these lunatics, Frank?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.667
Your most devoted fans.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.751
(Woman)...crackers
and Kool-Aid, no big deal...

06:18.792 --> 06:21.376
I'll treasure this. Always.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.667
Roger, "Blood Dance" was released
over a year ago.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.667
We can't keep doing the same
autograph sessions any more.

06:27.709 --> 06:30.876
Your fans are hungry
for something new.

06:31.001 --> 06:33.501
- Got anything? Five pages, anything?
- Frank!

06:33.667 --> 06:37.001
Look, Roger, if you don't have a new book
on my desk by the end of the month,

06:37.042 --> 06:39.667
you're gonna have to pay the advance
back to Doubleday.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.209
Then you're really gonna be
up the creek.

06:42.251 --> 06:45.001
Come on, Roger, you have already
lost your wife over this thing.

06:45.042 --> 06:46.459
(Roger) Ha!

06:46.501 --> 06:49.459
(Frank) Are you gonna throw your career
down the toilet, too?

06:49.501 --> 06:51.834
- Rog, you have to get back to your life.
- Frank, come on!

06:51.876 --> 06:55.667
And listen, while we're on the subject
of the book, Roger, nobody...

06:55.709 --> 06:59.667
Nobody wants to read about
the goddamn Vietnam War any more.

06:59.709 --> 07:00.709
They wanna read
a good horror story.

07:00.751 --> 07:03.709
(Roger) Frank, would you listen to me
for a second, all right?

07:03.751 --> 07:07.667
I know this book has been giving me
a problem, but it's something I have to do.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.417
I've got to write this book.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.834
(Inhales sharply)

07:42.292 --> 07:44.001
(Computer off)

07:54.459 --> 07:56.126
(Line ringing)

07:56.167 --> 07:58.584
'Federal Bureau of Investigation.'

07:58.626 --> 08:02.042
Hello, um... Agent Thatcher, please.
Tell him it's Roger Cobb.

08:02.084 --> 08:04.709
- Tell him it's urgent.
- 'I'm sorry, he's on another line.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.834
- 'Can he call you back?'
- I'll wait.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.126
(Agent Thatcher) 'Yes, Mr. Cobb?'

08:11.167 --> 08:12.709
Uh, hear anything?

08:12.751 --> 08:16.042
'No, afraid we don't have anything
new about your son.'

08:17.126 --> 08:19.334
- But you'll call me?
- 'You know we will.

08:20.292 --> 08:24.126
'Um, by the way,
I got a call from Decker at CIA.

08:24.167 --> 08:27.584
'Please do me a favor.
Leave him alone.'

08:28.209 --> 08:29.126
Yeah.

08:29.251 --> 08:31.501
- Thank you very much.
- 'You bet. We'll call you.'

08:31.542 --> 08:33.292
(Dial tone)

08:33.333 --> 08:34.958
(Hangs up)

08:38.167 --> 08:40.167
(Phone rings)

08:47.376 --> 08:49.334
( Loud rock)
Hello?

08:49.376 --> 08:51.126
- (Woman) 'Roger.'
- Yeah.

08:51.167 --> 08:52.376
What's that noise?

08:52.417 --> 08:54.417
The guys have got the music turned up.
Hold on a minute.

08:54.459 --> 08:56.084
Hey, guys,
would you turn that down?

08:56.126 --> 08:59.459
I mean, I'm on the phone,
for crying out loud.

09:01.084 --> 09:02.459
(Laughs) Yeah.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.751
Uh, I'm sorry, this poker game's
getting a little out of hand.

09:05.792 --> 09:08.459
- Who's there?
- Uh...

09:09.459 --> 09:12.251
Oh, a bunch of guys, you know.

09:12.292 --> 09:14.917
I'm calling from
the awards party.

09:15.042 --> 09:15.917
I lost.

09:15.959 --> 09:19.792
Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
The awards, I forgot all about it.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.834
Um, I've been busy working.

09:21.876 --> 09:24.626
Are you writing again?
That's wonderful.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.209
- Um...
- Sandy, I'm sorry.

09:26.251 --> 09:28.001
- Hold on. Thanks.
- Tough break.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.876
'Can't win them all!
I was just calling'

09:30.917 --> 09:34.542
to tell you I got your message.
I'm sorry about your aunt.

09:35.292 --> 09:36.501
I went to the house.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.376
Roger, why do you keep
doing this to yourself?

09:39.417 --> 09:42.084
- (Man) OK, everybody, let's look happy.
- (Sandy) Why can't you just...

09:42.126 --> 09:43.792
'Can you hold on just one second?'

09:43.834 --> 09:46.542
(Clears throat)
Hold on, wait... Sandy, I got to go.

09:46.584 --> 09:48.459
Uh, listen, I'm holding up the game.

09:48.501 --> 09:50.834
So, uh, I'll talk to you later, OK?

09:50.876 --> 09:53.167
- (Man) How's this?
- OK. Roger?

09:54.126 --> 09:55.251
Yeah?

09:55.292 --> 09:59.167
- (Man) Come on, babe, smile.
- Nothing. Bye.

09:59.209 --> 10:00.917
Goodbye.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.792
Hello, Sandy?
Sandy!

10:11.542 --> 10:14.209
I'm such a jerk.

10:30.584 --> 10:34.334
(Jungle animals calling)

10:44.126 --> 10:45.584
(Screams)

10:45.626 --> 10:46.792
(Gasps)

10:46.834 --> 10:48.876
(Panting)

11:01.126 --> 11:03.126
(Crow cawing)

11:18.001 --> 11:20.167
Well, here's
the lucky man.

11:24.001 --> 11:26.292
- Mr. Parker.
- Mr. Cobb.

11:26.334 --> 11:29.584
It's a pleasure to see you again.
How was the drive?

11:29.626 --> 11:31.584
- Well, actually it wasn't...
- Good, good, good.

11:31.626 --> 11:33.584
- Glad to hear it.
- ..too bad.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.001
You know, I didn't expect
to hear from you again so soon.

11:36.042 --> 11:38.709
I just got the "For Sale" sign
up yesterday.

11:46.126 --> 11:47.792
I can assure you
everything's in order.

11:47.917 --> 11:51.251
It really wasn't necessary
for you to come all this way.

11:51.292 --> 11:53.084
(Roger) It's all right. I wanted to.

11:53.126 --> 11:55.126
(Mr. Parker) Your uncle was
quite a fisherman.

11:55.167 --> 11:58.417
I understand he held the US record
for two years with that one.

11:58.459 --> 12:00.042
Uh-huh.

12:07.584 --> 12:11.501
As you can see,
we cleaned the place up a bit.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.667
Planning to hold the auction next month.

12:22.626 --> 12:26.542
We can get a lot of money
for some of this junk.

12:28.084 --> 12:32.376
Now, if you'd like to follow me this way,
I'll give you a little tour of the place.

12:32.417 --> 12:34.417
It's all right.
I know my way around.

12:34.459 --> 12:37.876
- I grew up here.
- How's that?

12:39.459 --> 12:42.417
When my mother died,
my aunt raised me.

12:42.459 --> 12:45.792
I had no idea.
What a remarkable woman!

12:45.834 --> 12:48.001
(Birdsong)

13:02.667 --> 13:05.126
We also cleaned up the pool.

13:15.251 --> 13:16.584
Jimmy?

13:21.084 --> 13:22.542
Jimmy.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.084
Jimmy?

13:26.126 --> 13:27.751
Jimmy!

13:31.126 --> 13:32.084
Jim!

13:32.126 --> 13:34.834
(Car engine starts)

13:36.876 --> 13:39.084
(Tires screeching)

13:42.542 --> 13:44.084
Sandy?

13:45.084 --> 13:46.917
- Sandy.
- Is something wrong?

13:46.959 --> 13:50.042
- Honey, is Jimmy in there with you?
- No, I thought he was with you.

13:50.084 --> 13:53.084
- He's not.
- Check in the back?

13:54.126 --> 13:56.084
(Roger) Jimmy!

13:57.626 --> 13:59.084
Jimmy!

14:16.667 --> 14:18.084
Jimmy!

14:47.084 --> 14:49.376
(Parker) Mr. Cobb, are you OK?

14:53.084 --> 14:57.626
- Yeah.
- Let's move on to the studio, shall we?

15:01.001 --> 15:03.334
This'll make
a great guesthouse.

15:03.459 --> 15:07.542
Bathroom over there,
knock through a door, hot tub Jacuzzi.

15:08.084 --> 15:09.626
Kitchenette goes here.

15:10.292 --> 15:12.542
Hey, you know,
got a nephew named Manny,

15:12.667 --> 15:15.501
he's in the construction business,
works cheap.

15:15.626 --> 15:18.501
He could do a heck
of a job with this place.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.667
Worse comes to worse,

15:20.792 --> 15:25.084
person could, uh,
lease out the big house and move in here.

15:25.501 --> 15:27.417
Creative financing.

15:28.584 --> 15:30.376
Say, whatever happened
to this uncle?

15:31.501 --> 15:33.626
Oh, he was diving for abalone
off of Point Reyes...

15:33.667 --> 15:35.626
(Arrow twangs)

15:35.667 --> 15:38.209
(Laughing) Oops, sorry about that.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.792
You know, your aunt was quite a painter,
let me tell you.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.334
You take a look at this, will you?

15:45.376 --> 15:48.959
She must have been working on this
right before she died.

15:49.084 --> 15:52.126
Gives me the creeps.
Morbid little woman, wasn't she?

15:52.167 --> 15:54.084
(Roger) That's the closet in her bedroom.

15:54.126 --> 15:56.876
(Parker) It's the same room
where she hung her...

15:56.917 --> 15:58.792
Where she passed away.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.334
You know, she thought
this house was haunted.

16:02.459 --> 16:04.376
Get outta here!

16:04.959 --> 16:06.959
You're kidding,
aren't you?

16:09.626 --> 16:11.542
(Detective) Mr. Cobb,
your son is not in the pool.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.001
Your son is nowhere
in the neighborhood.

16:13.126 --> 16:16.376
(Sandy sobbing)
I'm telling you I saw him in the pool.

16:16.751 --> 16:21.459
He was in the swimming pool.
And I ran and I dove in.

16:21.501 --> 16:22.959
(Detective) And he wasn't there.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.001
Mr. Cobb, we've got
an APB out on your son.

16:27.584 --> 16:29.917
We'll let you know as soon
as we have something.

16:30.042 --> 16:32.126
(Aunt Elizabeth) It was the house.

16:32.167 --> 16:34.251
It was the house that did it.

16:34.292 --> 16:37.126
Right, Mrs. Hooper,
we understand.

16:37.917 --> 16:41.126
I'm telling you, Roger,
it was the house.

16:41.167 --> 16:46.167
Will you shut up? Will you shut up
just for once, you old bat?

16:49.167 --> 16:50.542
Touchy.

16:51.251 --> 16:53.376
(Roger) I'm sorry, Mr. Parker,
I'm not selling.

16:53.501 --> 16:55.667
- What?
- I said I'm not selling.

16:57.292 --> 16:58.459
Well, I hope you reconsider.

17:00.334 --> 17:02.834
I think I'm going to stay a while.

17:02.959 --> 17:03.959
Do some work.

17:09.041 --> 17:11.334
(Crickets singing)

17:11.376 --> 17:13.376
(Owls hooting)

17:58.542 --> 18:00.126
Ow!

18:01.834 --> 18:03.376
(Clattering)

18:15.626 --> 18:16.876
Hello?

18:20.376 --> 18:21.876
(Clattering)

18:43.751 --> 18:45.626
(Woman) Hello?

19:19.751 --> 19:21.209
(Scraping)

19:35.084 --> 19:36.501
Aunt Elizabeth.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.126
It won, Roger.

19:38.709 --> 19:39.667
It tricked me.

19:39.709 --> 19:42.751
I didn't think it could,
but it did.

19:44.126 --> 19:45.709
What?

19:48.084 --> 19:50.834
It's going to trick you, too, Roger.

19:50.876 --> 19:54.501
This house knows
everything about you.

19:55.126 --> 19:57.001
Leave while you can!

19:57.042 --> 19:58.376
No!

20:00.792 --> 20:03.084
(Dogs barking)

20:41.584 --> 20:43.459
Hey! Hey!

20:51.792 --> 20:53.167
Morning.

21:02.709 --> 21:04.376
She's pretty, eh?

21:04.667 --> 21:05.626
Hi.

21:07.042 --> 21:09.501
Howdy, neighbor.
Just move in?

21:09.542 --> 21:11.042
Yeah, last night.

21:11.084 --> 21:12.917
- Harold Gorton.
- Hi. Roger.

21:12.959 --> 21:14.167
Roger, well...

21:14.209 --> 21:16.501
Hey, it's great
to have a new neighbor.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.501
Woman lived here
before you was nuts.

21:19.542 --> 21:21.501
Biggest bitch under the sun.

21:21.542 --> 21:23.126
Just a senile
old hag, really.

21:23.167 --> 21:25.834
Wouldn't be surprised if someone
just got fed up and offed her,

21:25.959 --> 21:26.792
you know what I mean?

21:26.834 --> 21:29.501
- She was my aunt.
- Heart of gold, though.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.501
Just a... A saint, really.

21:31.542 --> 21:34.209
And such a beautiful woman for her age.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.626
Would you like some dinner,
you and the whole family?

21:36.667 --> 21:39.417
Just come on over,
I'll whip something up, you know.

21:39.459 --> 21:42.876
- Afraid I'm alone.
- You're alone, well...

21:42.917 --> 21:47.626
That's better yet. Just get some burgers,
watch the game. You're an A's fan, right?

21:47.667 --> 21:49.501
Uh, yeah, uh, sort of.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.584
I'm a writer. I'm up here just kinda
trying to get away from things

21:52.626 --> 21:55.501
for a while, you know, uh...

21:55.542 --> 21:57.167
Solitude.

21:58.709 --> 22:00.084
You know?

22:00.126 --> 22:03.334
- Solitude?
- I don't believe this.

22:03.376 --> 22:07.501
This can't be, right?
Roger. Roger Cobb, right?

22:07.542 --> 22:10.459
- Yeah, that's, uh, that's me.
- I'm your biggest fan.

22:10.501 --> 22:13.084
- Is that right?
- Yes, absolutely! Right here...

22:13.126 --> 22:16.126
Whoops! It's, yeah, it's a little...

22:16.167 --> 22:18.542
Kinda falling apart but, um...

22:18.584 --> 22:20.042
Would you mind
autographing this for me?

22:20.084 --> 22:24.084
Oh, you bet. You, uh... You got a pen?

22:26.542 --> 22:27.709
No.

22:27.751 --> 22:30.876
You know what why don't we do this later?

22:30.917 --> 22:33.501
'Cause I wanna get back inside
and get started on my new book,

22:33.542 --> 22:37.501
you know,
and get back to that, uh, solitude.

22:37.542 --> 22:39.126
Solitude.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.001
Of course, solitude.

22:41.042 --> 22:43.834
- You understand, don't you?
- Oh, absolutely!

22:43.876 --> 22:47.542
- Bet it's gonna be great, huh?
- I hope so.

22:47.959 --> 22:50.001
OK.

22:50.126 --> 22:51.917
Roger Cobb.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.959
Lord help me.

23:19.542 --> 23:20.709
(Typing)

23:29.542 --> 23:30.667
(Jungle animals calling)

23:35.876 --> 23:38.417
Get up off your ass, Cobb.
(Gasping)

23:38.542 --> 23:40.876
Got a war to lose, remember?

23:40.917 --> 23:43.042
You, too, Ben. Move!

23:43.084 --> 23:45.084
All right, everybody,
gather round.

23:45.126 --> 23:48.709
I am sick of that punk
telling me what to do.

23:49.292 --> 23:52.876
That's his job, Ben,
telling us what to do.

23:53.626 --> 23:55.626
Nobody tells me what to do, buddy.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.834
Let's go, hustle it up.

24:08.584 --> 24:11.042
(Lieutenant) Now, this is where
we gotta be by 0600 hours.

24:11.167 --> 24:14.084
That means we've got to be across
this route within the hour

24:14.126 --> 24:15.542
- and find the bridge...
- Ben!

24:15.584 --> 24:17.209
- Big Ben!
- What do you want?

24:17.334 --> 24:19.209
May I have a cigarette?

24:19.334 --> 24:21.834
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

24:21.876 --> 24:23.626
(Lieutenant)...so, if you see any NVA,

24:23.667 --> 24:27.251
we'll call for an air strike
and just try to hold our position.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.042
(Laughing)

24:30.084 --> 24:33.167
Pipe down!
Man, what are you doing?

24:33.751 --> 24:36.209
- Nothing.
- Shut up and listen, you big ox.

24:36.251 --> 24:39.126
We ain't fucking around any more.
This is the real shit.

24:39.167 --> 24:43.292
You guys better get your act together if
you want to get out of here in one piece.

24:43.876 --> 24:47.792
- Fitzsimmons, take the right flank...
- Very funny.

24:47.834 --> 24:51.834
Head, Scott.
Now, Steel, you take the left flank.

24:52.667 --> 24:54.501
We're just gonna police here...

24:55.334 --> 24:57.209
Get down!

24:57.417 --> 24:59.001
(Explosion)

25:00.376 --> 25:01.876
(Gunshots)

25:09.001 --> 25:09.959
Ben!

25:10.209 --> 25:12.917
Come and get it, motherfucker!

25:19.459 --> 25:21.001
(Laughs)

25:22.209 --> 25:23.667
(Typing)

25:36.626 --> 25:40.667
'Agh! Oh, Mrs. Callahan,
why do you creep around like that?

25:41.667 --> 25:44.584
'Who did this to you? It was Masters?

25:44.959 --> 25:45.667
'Oh, God!

25:45.709 --> 25:48.917
'It's true she's a patient here?

25:48.959 --> 25:52.084
'A patient of Dr. Stevens?'

25:58.542 --> 26:02.001
(Laughing)

26:05.459 --> 26:07.042
(Jimmy) Daddy.

26:09.459 --> 26:10.917
(Jimmy laughs)

26:28.626 --> 26:30.251
(Jimmy laughs)

27:05.042 --> 27:06.667
(Jimmy) Help!

27:36.501 --> 27:38.459
I must be going crazy.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.834
(Clock chimes)

28:51.001 --> 28:53.292
(Growling, snarling)

28:59.376 --> 29:02.001
(He groans, snarling subsides)

29:45.251 --> 29:49.417
One, two, three.

29:59.542 --> 30:01.334
(Screaming)

30:04.001 --> 30:06.626
Hey, Rog. What you doing?

30:06.667 --> 30:08.001
Me?

30:08.959 --> 30:10.001
Nothing.

30:12.126 --> 30:16.376
I'm just, uh...
I'm working on my book, you know.

30:16.417 --> 30:18.459
Uh, good to see you.

30:19.459 --> 30:20.417
Um...

30:20.459 --> 30:23.709
- I need to get back inside and...
- Solitude.

30:23.751 --> 30:25.417
Solitude. Yes, right.

30:25.459 --> 30:28.292
I'll see you later, though, OK.

30:28.626 --> 30:29.876
Bye.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.667
Mmm. Writing looks like fun, huh?

30:37.709 --> 30:39.667
Come on.
(Dog barks)

30:56.459 --> 30:57.876
That's OK.

30:58.126 --> 30:59.876
Check this.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.876
Nice picture.

31:04.292 --> 31:06.042
Crazy, huh?

31:06.084 --> 31:07.084
OK.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.251
Let's see. Rewind.

31:09.292 --> 31:10.876
That's all right.

31:12.001 --> 31:16.876
That's all right.
That's all right. That's all right.

31:18.667 --> 31:19.959
OK.

31:23.876 --> 31:25.292
Nice and easy.

31:29.876 --> 31:30.959
All right.

31:31.001 --> 31:33.501
Let's see what we got here.

31:56.626 --> 31:57.876
One.

32:01.501 --> 32:02.876
Two.

32:06.542 --> 32:07.876
Three.

32:09.251 --> 32:10.876
(Hinges creek)

32:48.626 --> 32:50.709
(Clock chiming)

33:08.459 --> 33:10.584
- Rog...
- Agh!

33:10.626 --> 33:13.542
- What? What's going on? What?
- Harold, don't do that!

33:13.584 --> 33:16.376
- What did I do?
- You scared the hell out of me.

33:16.417 --> 33:19.626
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd bring over a midnight snack.

33:19.667 --> 33:23.292
Solitude's always better
with someone else around, you know.

33:23.417 --> 33:25.001
Should I...?

33:25.376 --> 33:28.417
Why don't we go downstairs to
the dining room and eat that, all right?

33:28.459 --> 33:32.376
- What's all the cameras for, Rog?
- I'll explain it to you downstairs.

33:34.626 --> 33:40.917
So, that's when I decided
I'd come up here, try and write my book.

33:42.126 --> 33:44.209
Life's a bitch, huh?

33:45.334 --> 33:48.542
So, what's all those cameras for upstairs?

33:54.001 --> 33:56.251
Do you believe in ghosts?

33:56.459 --> 33:59.001
Well, what kind of ghosts?

34:00.834 --> 34:03.584
My aunt thought
this house was haunted.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.834
No offense, Rog,
but your aunt was loony toons.

34:09.208 --> 34:13.626
What about me?
You think that I'm... loony toons?

34:14.958 --> 34:16.542
Not at all.

34:16.583 --> 34:20.458
I mean, you've been to Vietnam,
lost your only child,

34:20.501 --> 34:23.876
your wife divorced you, I mean,
you got a few marbles going around,

34:23.917 --> 34:26.458
but right now you seem fine.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.583
I think this house is haunted.

34:35.251 --> 34:39.542
You know, I find that unexplained psychic
stuff kinda interesting myself but,

34:39.583 --> 34:41.876
problem is, they usually go ahead

34:41.917 --> 34:44.542
and find some explanation anyway
for the unexplained stuff.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.792
In the closet upstairs, I saw something.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.501
This is other than coats
and hats, etcetera.

34:49.542 --> 34:54.001
No, no,
I saw a, a... a ghost, something.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.126
I opened the closet door and
it reached out and it tried to grab me.

34:57.167 --> 35:00.542
This is sounding a little bit like
some of your novels.

35:00.584 --> 35:02.542
You sure you're just not imagining this?

35:02.584 --> 35:04.417
Does this look like imagination?

35:06.501 --> 35:07.876
That's a very nasty scratch.

35:07.917 --> 35:10.542
I think you ought to have
someone look at that.

35:10.584 --> 35:13.959
I opened the closet door,

35:14.001 --> 35:16.792
and it reached out
and it tried to grab me.

35:19.001 --> 35:21.334
Where do you suppose
the monster is now,

35:21.376 --> 35:24.876
just kind of hanging out
in the closet up there?

35:25.751 --> 35:27.001
I don't know.

35:28.084 --> 35:31.334
So, all the cameras up there, you're
naturally trying to get a photo of it.

35:31.376 --> 35:33.584
- That's right.
- Yeah, well, yeah.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.084
You think I'm...

35:36.126 --> 35:37.876
No, no, not at all.

35:37.917 --> 35:40.376
- You do.
- No, no, no.

35:40.542 --> 35:42.751
As a matter of fact,
if you get a picture of this thing,

35:42.792 --> 35:47.542
I'd love to see it because, you know,
I don't think I've seen a ghost before.

35:47.584 --> 35:49.459
At least not since I was a kid.

35:49.501 --> 35:52.167
Well, it's great talking with you, Rog.

35:52.209 --> 35:55.542
And I'll be sure
to look for your wife on TV.

35:55.584 --> 35:57.501
What's that show called?

35:57.542 --> 35:58.459
"Resort".

35:58.501 --> 36:00.417
"Resort" right.
And Wednesdays, 10:00?

36:00.459 --> 36:02.542
- Right.
- All right. I'll be sure to look for it.

36:02.584 --> 36:06.501
- Harold. Thanks for the food.
- Oh, no problem.

36:13.542 --> 36:15.542
(Phone ringing)

36:18.334 --> 36:19.334
Hello.

36:19.376 --> 36:22.459
- Sandy Cobb, please?
- Speaking. Who's this?

36:22.501 --> 36:24.626
- 'This is Harold.'
- Who?

36:24.667 --> 36:26.501
Harold Gorton, a friend of Roger's.

36:26.542 --> 36:29.167
Oh, he can't be reached here.

36:29.209 --> 36:31.251
- 'Aren't you calling a bit late?'
- Yes, sorry.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.459
But I didn't want to talk to Roger.

36:33.501 --> 36:35.251
I'd like to talk to you, actually.

36:35.376 --> 36:36.334
Oh?

36:36.459 --> 36:38.917
'See, I live next door
to Roger on here in Marin.'

36:38.959 --> 36:42.251
And this is gonna sound a little strange,

36:42.292 --> 36:44.917
but I thought I should
call you 'cause

36:44.959 --> 36:47.209
I don't think Roger's
got his act together.

36:47.251 --> 36:50.542
- What do you mean?
- 'He's having flashbacks or something.'

36:50.584 --> 36:52.667
Seeing strange things.

36:52.709 --> 36:55.251
- Ghosts and stuff.
- Oh, my God!

36:55.292 --> 36:58.209
'Yeah, I think you ought come up here
and check the guy out.'

36:58.251 --> 36:59.292
(Sighs)

36:59.334 --> 37:00.792
I can't.

37:00.834 --> 37:04.542
I've gotta be on the set
at 6:30 tomorrow morning. I really can't.

37:05.709 --> 37:07.834
'I'll call him right away.'

37:07.876 --> 37:10.376
Well, all right. Go ahead and call him.

37:10.417 --> 37:13.626
I'll just keep an eye on him
up here for you, OK?

37:13.667 --> 37:16.751
OK. Let me give you my daytime number.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.126
All right. Go.

37:20.167 --> 37:25.292
'954-1473.'

37:26.292 --> 37:27.251
73... Got it!

37:27.292 --> 37:30.751
All right. Don't worry
about anything, I guess.

37:30.792 --> 37:34.751
I'll just be sure to give you a call
if something bad happens.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.001
Thanks.

37:37.042 --> 37:38.876
Uh, bye.

37:39.751 --> 37:41.209
(Dial tone)

37:45.376 --> 37:46.792
(Sighs)

37:49.251 --> 37:51.251
(Phone ringing)

37:52.001 --> 37:53.542
(Owl hooting)

37:54.292 --> 37:57.334
(Phone ringing)

38:16.459 --> 38:19.417
(Whispers) Fitzsimmons,
you walk in point.

38:19.459 --> 38:21.334
Like hell I am.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.001
Scott?

38:24.042 --> 38:26.626
Forget it, man. No way!

38:26.667 --> 38:28.626
I haven't got time to argue, God damn it!

38:28.667 --> 38:30.501
I'll walk point.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.584
Ben!

38:33.251 --> 38:35.751
It's nice to see somebody around here
has got some guts.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.667
Somebody got no brains, too.

38:37.709 --> 38:39.417
(Laughs)

38:40.459 --> 38:42.792
- That means you too, Cobb.
- What?

38:42.834 --> 38:44.626
- You heard me.
- All right, Rog.

38:44.667 --> 38:47.167
You and me, buddy. Let's go get 'em.

38:49.626 --> 38:53.376
(Lieutenant) Now, move out.
Fitzsimmons, you take the rear.

39:04.584 --> 39:07.334
(Jungle creatures calling)

39:13.959 --> 39:15.334
Come on!

39:41.751 --> 39:45.126
(Whispers) Hey, Ben. Hey. Slow down, Ben.

39:47.709 --> 39:49.876
(Mimicking chicken)

40:11.501 --> 40:12.626
Stop!

40:13.876 --> 40:15.292
What?

40:16.459 --> 40:17.792
(Branch snaps)

40:20.667 --> 40:22.542
I heard something.

40:26.292 --> 40:29.417
Ben, don't be an idiot.
We're out of their line of sight.

40:29.459 --> 40:32.417
You were the guy
who heard something, right?

40:32.542 --> 40:37.209
(Low whisper) I got an idea.
Let's find out where Charlie really is.

40:39.251 --> 40:41.167
(Loudly) Yoo-hoo!

40:41.209 --> 40:43.501
(Ben) Charlie!

40:49.459 --> 40:51.209
(Whispers) Let's just stay right here.

40:51.251 --> 40:54.792
I can't stand in one spot.
I gotta keep moving.

40:55.834 --> 40:57.917
Ben, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

40:57.959 --> 40:59.584
(Gasps)

41:32.501 --> 41:33.876
Jimmy?

42:09.542 --> 42:14.209
Come on! Just stop moving,
for Christ's sake!

42:50.042 --> 42:52.251
(Clattering)

43:24.626 --> 43:26.542
(Panting)

43:30.084 --> 43:32.084
(Thudding)

43:49.001 --> 43:50.042
(Gunshot)

43:50.792 --> 43:52.459
(Whimpers)

44:19.376 --> 44:21.209
(Clattering on door)

44:46.709 --> 44:48.042
Hi.

44:48.709 --> 44:49.792
Sandy.

44:49.834 --> 44:55.084
I tried to call but there was no answer.
I was worried about you, Roger.

44:56.334 --> 45:00.459
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

45:01.042 --> 45:03.376
What are you doing with that gun?

45:04.501 --> 45:06.792
Nothing, I'm...

45:12.626 --> 45:14.542
(Clatters on floor)

45:15.751 --> 45:16.792
Sandy.

45:17.584 --> 45:19.084
(Screams)

45:24.501 --> 45:26.792
(Creature cackling)

45:28.459 --> 45:30.251
(Cackling)

45:31.042 --> 45:32.042
(Squeals)

45:41.209 --> 45:43.167
(Roger) Oh, my God!

45:47.959 --> 45:50.459
He's got a gun!

45:58.292 --> 46:02.376
Yes, I'd like to report a...
a suicide attempt.

46:15.709 --> 46:17.126
(Sobs)

46:25.126 --> 46:27.501
(Siren approaching)

46:46.126 --> 46:49.501
No one will see in here.
It can't be you.

46:56.459 --> 46:58.459
(Sirens wailing)

47:17.459 --> 47:19.834
(Idly whistling)

47:20.459 --> 47:22.417
(Officer) Put the gun down.

47:23.209 --> 47:26.084
- Oh, it's not loaded.
- I said put the gun down, sir.

47:29.209 --> 47:31.126
All right now, stand up.

47:32.584 --> 47:35.751
Put your hands above your head
and move this way.

47:35.792 --> 47:37.459
Away from the gun.

47:39.876 --> 47:45.084
We have a report someone at this address
has been firing a shotgun.

47:46.251 --> 47:47.376
Oh, yeah, I was just...

47:47.417 --> 47:51.417
polishing it, you know, cleaning it,
and it went off by accident.

47:51.459 --> 47:52.917
I didn't know it was loaded.

47:52.959 --> 47:56.209
You know it's against the law to discharge
a firearm within city limits, don't you?

47:56.834 --> 47:59.917
I'm going to have to give you a citation.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.001
A citation?

48:03.459 --> 48:04.876
Thank you.

48:06.709 --> 48:09.876
Hey, wait a minute.
I know you, don't I?

48:09.917 --> 48:12.626
- You're Roger Cobb, right?
- Yeah, right.

48:12.667 --> 48:14.417
I'm sorry about your son.

48:14.459 --> 48:15.959
Mr. Cobb, I know this is a funny question,

48:16.001 --> 48:18.417
but you wouldn't happen
to be the same Roger Cobb

48:18.459 --> 48:23.209
- who wrote "Blood Dance", would you?
- Yeah. That's me.

48:23.251 --> 48:26.251
- Why didn't you say so earlier?
- (Laughs) I was just...

48:26.292 --> 48:28.834
Mr. Cobb, I was wondering
if you'd do me a big favor.

48:28.876 --> 48:31.084
- Oh, sure.
- I know you're probably busy and all...

48:31.126 --> 48:34.042
- No, no. You have a...
- Could I use your bathroom?

48:35.584 --> 48:38.167
No! I mean, yes, you can.

48:38.209 --> 48:41.126
Be my guest. Um, I'll...

48:41.167 --> 48:44.667
You men go ahead and take off.
We got it under control here.

48:46.501 --> 48:48.417
- Who are you?
- Harold. Next door neighbor.

48:48.459 --> 48:51.001
- Yeah, right. Beat it.
- But I was the one...

48:54.459 --> 48:57.126
Goodbye, Harold.

49:01.584 --> 49:03.792
The bathroom's right down the hall.

49:06.459 --> 49:09.292
Well, this is quite a place
you have here, Mr. Cobb.

49:09.334 --> 49:10.959
Thank you.

49:13.042 --> 49:16.292
The bathroom down here?

49:17.001 --> 49:19.001
No! Um...

49:21.417 --> 49:24.126
- It's right there.
- Oh. Thank you!

49:30.376 --> 49:31.542
(Coughs)

49:31.834 --> 49:35.876
So, I bet you guys could use
some coffee, huh?

49:35.917 --> 49:38.709
No, you're probably in a hurry.

49:38.751 --> 49:40.584
No, no, coffee would be great.

49:41.042 --> 49:44.376
Yeah, a cup of coffee would be nice.

49:44.417 --> 49:46.876
(Roger) Is instant OK?
(Officer) Sure.

49:52.334 --> 49:54.292
(Spoon clatters on floor)

50:03.376 --> 50:05.959
- Here, I got it. I got it.
- That's all right.

50:06.001 --> 50:08.209
- Got it.
- (Officer) Mmm-mmm.

50:08.251 --> 50:10.292
No, no. I got it.

50:14.459 --> 50:15.834
These look familiar to you?

50:16.542 --> 50:18.459
Uh...

50:18.501 --> 50:20.959
Yeah. Yeah, I...

50:21.001 --> 50:22.459
I dropped those.

50:23.126 --> 50:25.084
I thought you said
you were just cleaning the gun.

50:25.126 --> 50:30.626
No sense having a gun if you don't
load it at one time or another, is there?

50:31.709 --> 50:34.001
Well, I wouldn't recommend
cleaning a loaded gun.

50:34.042 --> 50:35.917
Oh, no, no, no. No!

50:38.459 --> 50:40.209
Neither would I.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.042
I'll be right back.

50:49.167 --> 50:50.334
What are you doing?

50:50.376 --> 50:53.126
Just looking
at this thing here on the wall.

50:54.376 --> 50:57.751
- My aunt was an artist.
- Yeah, I guess.

50:57.792 --> 51:01.376
Why don't you come back
into the kitchen? I have some coffee on.

51:01.417 --> 51:02.459
(Gasps)

51:02.501 --> 51:04.667
I didn't mean to startle you, Mr. Cobb.

51:04.709 --> 51:07.834
Well, guess we better get on out
of here, huh?

51:07.876 --> 51:10.834
Well, it was great talking with you guys.

51:14.959 --> 51:16.626
My gun!

51:17.001 --> 51:18.459
What about your gun?

51:18.501 --> 51:19.834
(Door creaking)

51:20.626 --> 51:23.209
Is there something wrong, Mr. Cobb?

51:25.126 --> 51:26.292
No.

51:26.334 --> 51:30.334
No.
(Chuckles) No problem. Just...

51:30.376 --> 51:33.792
- Thanks again for the coffee.
- Yeah, thanks a lot, Mr. Cobb.

51:41.376 --> 51:42.626
(Sighs)

51:46.501 --> 51:48.334
(Car engine starting)

51:52.626 --> 51:53.917
(Sighs deeply)

52:38.292 --> 52:40.001
(Door closes)

52:47.626 --> 52:49.084
(Door closes)

53:32.042 --> 53:36.459
(Squeaks) Where's your son, Roger?
You'll never find him.

53:36.501 --> 53:39.292
(Laughing) He's dead!

53:39.334 --> 53:40.876
He's not dead.

53:42.334 --> 53:44.334
He's some place in this house.

53:45.667 --> 53:47.626
Say your prayers.

53:51.334 --> 53:52.542
(Gun clicks)

53:53.584 --> 53:55.417
(Yelling)

54:05.167 --> 54:07.084
(Shouting)

54:10.292 --> 54:11.667
(Screams)

54:14.417 --> 54:15.834
Yeah!

54:16.792 --> 54:20.959
<i>Feelin' better now that we're through</i>

54:21.626 --> 54:25.917
<i>Feelin' better cos I'm over you</i>

54:25.959 --> 54:30.459
<i>I've learned my lesson
It left a scar</i>

54:30.501 --> 54:34.209
<i>And now I see how you really are</i>

54:34.251 --> 54:37.667
<i>You're no good, you're no good
You're no good</i>

54:37.709 --> 54:40.001
<i>Baby, you're no good</i>

54:40.917 --> 54:43.167
<i>I'm gonna say it again</i>

54:43.209 --> 54:46.459
<i>You're no good, you're no good
You're no good</i>

54:46.501 --> 54:48.792
<i>Baby, you're no good</i>

54:50.376 --> 54:52.376
<i>Mm, no</i>

54:52.417 --> 54:56.292
<i>I broke a heart that's gentle and true</i>

54:56.917 --> 55:01.001
<i>I left a boy for someone like you</i>

55:01.042 --> 55:05.126
<i>I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee</i>

55:05.834 --> 55:09.459
<i>But I wouldn't blame him
if he said to me</i>

55:09.501 --> 55:12.959
<i>"It's no good, no good
It's no good</i>

55:13.001 --> 55:15.376
<i>"Baby, it's no good"</i>

55:15.417 --> 55:19.751
<i>Oh, I say
You're no good, you're no good...</i>

55:19.959 --> 55:21.542
(Grunts)

55:21.667 --> 55:23.126
(Woman) Hello!

55:24.126 --> 55:27.709
(Laughing) Did I scare you?

55:28.834 --> 55:30.376
Hi.

55:31.584 --> 55:34.542
- What are you digging?
- A hole.

55:34.584 --> 55:35.751
- Oh?
- A big hole.

55:35.792 --> 55:37.292
Oh, I can see that.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.792
What's under the plastic? A sapling?

55:40.834 --> 55:43.376
A sapling, yes. It's an apricot tree.

55:43.417 --> 55:47.334
Oh, I used to come swim here
when your aunt lived here.

55:47.376 --> 55:50.584
I hope you don't think
I'm imposing or anything.

55:50.626 --> 55:51.792
Oh, no!

55:51.834 --> 55:54.792
- Not at all.
- My name is Tanya. Hi.

55:54.834 --> 55:57.792
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. I'm...

55:57.834 --> 56:00.751
- I'm Roger.
- (Laughing) Hi.

56:00.792 --> 56:02.792
Here with your wife?

56:02.834 --> 56:04.792
- Wife?
- No.

56:04.834 --> 56:07.834
- I'm divorced.
- Oh, really?

56:08.834 --> 56:10.251
Shame.

56:10.626 --> 56:12.626
You must be lonely.

56:13.542 --> 56:14.834
Ah, well...

56:15.501 --> 56:17.459
Well, I appreciate
the company, Tanya,

56:17.501 --> 56:20.251
but, you know, I'm kinda busy right now.

56:20.292 --> 56:22.042
Oh, no. Don't be silly. I understand.

56:22.084 --> 56:24.792
I can tell when a man
wants to work.

56:24.834 --> 56:27.834
I can also tell
when a man wants to play.

56:29.417 --> 56:31.959
- We should get together soon.
- Absolutely.

56:32.001 --> 56:34.417
- Neighbors shouldn't be strangers.
- I couldn't agree more.

56:34.459 --> 56:37.834
- Any other time, all right?
- All right. That's OK. Bye!

56:37.876 --> 56:39.876
- I'll see you later, OK?
- OK.

56:41.917 --> 56:43.792
(Groaning)

56:43.834 --> 56:45.917
Oh, um, Roger.

56:45.959 --> 56:49.751
If you need anything at all.
Just call, OK?

56:51.209 --> 56:53.834
All right. Bye.

56:54.376 --> 56:55.834
Bye.

56:59.417 --> 57:01.251
Son of a bitch!

57:11.376 --> 57:18.209
<i>This is dedicated to the one I love</i>

57:21.667 --> 57:28.167
<i>While I'm far away from you, my baby</i>

57:28.209 --> 57:34.251
<i>I know it's hard for you, my baby</i>

57:34.876 --> 57:40.792
<i>Because it's hard for me, my baby</i>

57:40.834 --> 57:45.417
<i>And the darkest hour is just before dawn</i>

57:47.709 --> 57:52.542
<i>Each night before you go to bed, my baby</i>

57:53.709 --> 57:59.001
<i>Whisper a little prayer for me, my baby</i>

57:59.667 --> 58:05.167
<i>And tell all the stars above</i>

58:05.209 --> 58:09.417
<i>This is dedicated to the one I love</i>

58:11.459 --> 58:16.417
<i>This is dedicated to the one I love</i>

58:17.042 --> 58:21.209
<i>This is dedicated to the one I love...</i>

58:28.917 --> 58:30.584
Oh, God! Drop it!

58:30.626 --> 58:33.334
Good boy. Good boy.

58:34.709 --> 58:36.751
Drop it.
Drop it!

58:36.792 --> 58:38.334
Stay, stay.

58:38.542 --> 58:39.792
Good dog.

58:39.834 --> 58:41.126
Good dog. Stay!

58:41.167 --> 58:43.667
(Shouts) Stay! Stay!

59:04.084 --> 59:05.834
Where's the car keys?

59:08.334 --> 59:10.417
Where's the car keys?

59:10.834 --> 59:12.459
(Knock at door)

59:15.167 --> 59:17.834
Hi. Ready to play?

59:19.126 --> 59:20.751
Hello!

59:22.834 --> 59:27.334
This is my son, Robert.
And he really loves to play.

59:28.751 --> 59:31.417
- Look, I was just about...
- Would you mind if we came inside?

59:31.459 --> 59:34.876
It's a little bit chilly out here.
I wouldn't want Robert to catch cold.

59:34.917 --> 59:37.667
Actually, I don't know if this is
the most appropriate time.

59:37.709 --> 59:40.459
- (Tanya) We'll only be a minute.
- Hi.

59:40.501 --> 59:43.667
That's very thoughtful of you, Tanya,

59:43.709 --> 59:45.876
but, at the same time,
I'm kind of busy right now.

59:45.917 --> 59:47.876
I think that I'm... I'm kind of...

59:47.917 --> 59:50.376
Where you going, little fella?

59:51.542 --> 59:54.376
Uh, stay here. I'll get him.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.084
- Roger?
- Stop!

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.209
Robert?

01:00:06.834 --> 01:00:09.042
Come here, Robert.
Robert, come here.

01:00:11.417 --> 01:00:12.584
I got you.

01:00:12.626 --> 01:00:13.792
Ah, I got you.

01:00:13.834 --> 01:00:16.501
Robert? Roger?

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:18.917
- I got him.
- (Tanya) Where are you going?

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:24.376
Roger?

01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:26.292
(Crying)

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:32.584
Robert?

01:00:45.001 --> 01:00:47.084
(Tanya) Robert?
(Robert crying)

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:48.834
It's OK. We're gonna see Mommy.

01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:50.834
- (Sobs) Mommy.
- Hi!

01:00:51.376 --> 01:00:53.876
- Here we are, Mom.
- Aw! Is everything okay?

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:57.042
Oh yeah. Robert, just had to go potty.
But we took care of everything.

01:00:57.084 --> 01:00:59.626
Roger, would you do me a great favor?

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:02.084
- I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy....
- Great! I need a babysitter.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:03.792
I'd really appreciate it.

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:06.167
You know, you're such
a good-looking, nice man.

01:01:06.209 --> 01:01:09.417
You know, Robert will just love you.
I have a few things for you. Hold on.

01:01:09.459 --> 01:01:11.126
No, no, I'm sorry...

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:15.084
Here we have a change of clothing,
extra sweater, blanket, OK?

01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:17.584
- (Laughing)
- Can't sleep without this one.

01:01:17.626 --> 01:01:19.792
- Favorite teddy. A few things here.
- Tanya.

01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:23.334
Duck for the bath.
Superman, if you will, thanks.

01:01:23.376 --> 01:01:27.084
I'll be back later tonight. I can't tell
you how much this means to me.

01:01:27.126 --> 01:01:28.667
Thanks!

01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:31.459
(Robert babbling)

01:01:31.501 --> 01:01:33.542
But, I...

01:01:33.584 --> 01:01:35.417
(Door shuts)

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:38.542
'My sister is an only child
and you abused her.

01:01:38.584 --> 01:01:40.167
'I can never forgive you for that.

01:01:40.209 --> 01:01:44.251
(Man) 'I can't hide the fact that I've
been a male prostitute my entire life.

01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:47.501
'Your sister paid me $2,000
to spend the night with her.'

01:01:47.542 --> 01:01:49.751
(Robert grizzling)

01:01:50.709 --> 01:01:53.167
'Don't you think it's time you woke up
and smelled the coffee?

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:57.209
'I'll smell whatever I damn well please -
without your help...!'

01:01:57.251 --> 01:01:58.626
Robert.

01:01:58.667 --> 01:02:00.584
(TV drama continues)

01:02:00.626 --> 01:02:03.167
(Robert crying)

01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:04.959
Robert, what's wrong?

01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:08.501
You want your mommy?
She'll be back here in a little bit, OK?

01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:11.292
How about this toy?
You want to buzz off, huh?

01:02:11.334 --> 01:02:13.209
- You want something else to play with?
- Yeah.

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:16.251
- How about a nice plastic bag?
- (Sobbing) Mommy.

01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:20.167
Come on, come on. I know. Mommy is coming
back in a few minutes, all right?

01:02:20.209 --> 01:02:22.292
She's gonna be right back.

01:02:22.334 --> 01:02:24.376
Let's go and watch some TV, OK?

01:02:25.084 --> 01:02:26.917
(Crying)

01:02:28.126 --> 01:02:29.709
That's a good boy.

01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:31.834
- 'I love you, Julie.
- Is that what you call love?

01:02:31.876 --> 01:02:34.251
'Well, if that's what you call love.
Then, I don't want any part of it.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.667
- 'What about the other night?
- What other night?

01:02:36.709 --> 01:02:38.959
'The other night by the pool, Julie.

01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:42.876
- 'Don't play dumb with me.
- Maybe I'm not as dumb as you think...'

01:02:42.917 --> 01:02:44.167
Come on.

01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:46.667
Just lay down right there, OK? Sleepy?

01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:51.376
Yeah, you've got tired eyes there,
don't you?

01:02:54.626 --> 01:02:59.084
'..You of all people should know
anything's possible when you're in love.'

01:03:21.709 --> 01:03:23.709
(Bird squawking)

01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:27.917
Come, let's go back.

01:03:30.167 --> 01:03:32.167
- All right!
- Ben!

01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:35.584
Ben, wait up.

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.709
Ben, we've lost them.
We're gonna get hit with friendly fire.

01:03:42.459 --> 01:03:44.167
Ben, your being a jerk.

01:03:44.209 --> 01:03:46.876
Magic time.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.209
Ben...

01:03:59.876 --> 01:04:01.167
Get down.

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:06.126
- Shut up, Roger. I know what I'm doing.
- Ben...

01:04:09.167 --> 01:04:10.876
(Rapid gunfire)

01:04:10.917 --> 01:04:12.501
(Ben screams)

01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:20.667
(Sighs)

01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:42.959
Robert?

01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:54.459
Robert?

01:04:55.334 --> 01:04:57.542
(Critters cackling)

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:07.876
Robert!

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:13.626
Let go!

01:05:13.751 --> 01:05:15.126
Whoa!

01:05:19.126 --> 01:05:21.876
(Roger straining)

01:05:26.126 --> 01:05:28.876
I got you. I got you.

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:30.167
Let go!

01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:34.917
Let go!

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:43.376
(Sighing) Oh, boy!

01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:46.876
How's a little kid like you
get into so much trouble?

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:50.292
- (Babbling)
- Yeah. How about that?

01:05:54.001 --> 01:05:56.001
Don't do that, OK?

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.709
(Giggles)

01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:02.542
Cute.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.501
(Laughing)

01:06:04.542 --> 01:06:05.959
Oh! Oh!

01:06:08.667 --> 01:06:09.876
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:10.751
How did it all go?

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:11.876
- Oh, he, uh...
- Hmm?

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:14.251
He slept like a lamb.
He's just an angel.

01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:16.167
- Did you have fun? Hm?
- Yeah.

01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:18.501
Was Roger nice to you?

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.209
Yeah? Oh, good.

01:06:20.251 --> 01:06:23.334
- I knew I could trust you, Roger.
- Mm-hm.

01:06:23.376 --> 01:06:25.876
Come on. Let's say goodbye to Roger now.
Come on.

01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:29.501
OK. Bye bye. Bye bye, Robert.
You come back and visit me, all right?

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:33.001
- Bye.
- Bye bye. I appreciate it. Thanks.

01:06:34.959 --> 01:06:36.792
(Clock ticking)

01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:50.792
Hello!

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:53.417
- Hi! (Laughing)
- Ah! Here's the, uh, beer.

01:06:53.459 --> 01:06:55.751
- Hope we haven't missed the beginning.
- Well, no.

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:58.876
Uh, but I really didn't bring you over
here to watch a movie.

01:06:58.917 --> 01:07:01.251
- You didn't?
- Uh, no.

01:07:01.292 --> 01:07:04.459
- Uh, you've got some...
- Let's go upstairs for a minute, Harold.

01:07:04.501 --> 01:07:05.501
Yeah.

01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.584
- You ever been hunting?
- Sure.

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:13.042
Do you remember the other night
when I told you I saw something?

01:07:13.084 --> 01:07:15.876
- Yeah.
- I guess I was a little hysterical

01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:18.876
because it wasn't a ghost.

01:07:18.917 --> 01:07:21.167
- It was a raccoon.
- Really?

01:07:21.209 --> 01:07:24.667
A big raccoon.
About the size of a Saint Bernard.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:27.084
Ohh... Cujo, the raccoon.

01:07:28.167 --> 01:07:30.251
I got them trapped right now.
They're in the closet.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:36.209
You're not afraid
of a raccoon, are you?

01:07:36.251 --> 01:07:38.626
Me? No! No!

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:41.292
(Inhaling) What would you
like me to do?

01:07:41.334 --> 01:07:42.959
I-I'll help.

01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:46.917
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:49.292
(Sighing) Yeah, sure. Every day.
What is it?

01:07:49.334 --> 01:07:51.792
- This is my uncle's harpoon gun.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:54.876
- Take it.
- Great.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:57.792
I have a line attached here to a rod.

01:07:57.834 --> 01:08:01.084
In case it tries to get out through
the roof, you can hold on to the thing.

01:08:01.126 --> 01:08:03.334
Oh, wait, wait. The roof? Why?

01:08:03.376 --> 01:08:07.542
It tore up a big hole so it goes out
through the attic and he feeds at night.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:11.501
And then he comes back in here
and he builds a nest in the closet.

01:08:11.542 --> 01:08:12.959
Honestly?

01:08:15.876 --> 01:08:17.751
You'd better put these on.

01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:22.251
The minute you see this thing,

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:24.417
I want you to fire
and hit him right between the eyes.

01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:27.292
If you don't kill him, Harold,
he's probably gonna try and get away.

01:08:27.334 --> 01:08:30.751
So, I want you to hold on very tight.
You got that?

01:08:32.584 --> 01:08:34.251
OK. Come over here.

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:36.376
Stand right there
so you get a real good shot at him.

01:08:36.417 --> 01:08:39.251
- Yeah.
- So, we time everything perfect.

01:08:39.292 --> 01:08:43.834
I'm gonna open the door
at exactly 12:00.

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:44.917
Right. Right.

01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:46.626
- OK?
- Mmm.

01:08:53.167 --> 01:08:55.084
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yeah?

01:08:55.126 --> 01:08:58.876
Make sure I'm out of the way
before you shoot that thing.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:01.376
I got it.

01:09:02.584 --> 01:09:04.834
(Clock chimes)

01:09:04.876 --> 01:09:06.709
Here we go.

01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:10.292
(Chiming)

01:09:11.334 --> 01:09:12.542
Ready?

01:09:26.501 --> 01:09:28.501
(Growling)

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:30.459
(Screaming)

01:09:36.209 --> 01:09:37.917
Shoot him, Harold.

01:09:38.126 --> 01:09:39.417
Shoot him, Harold.

01:09:39.459 --> 01:09:40.709
Shoot him!

01:09:40.751 --> 01:09:43.126
(Roger groaning)

01:09:45.167 --> 01:09:46.792
Aagh!

01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:51.917
- Shoot it again!
- I can't. The line's attached.

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:53.876
Harold! Do something.

01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:55.917
It's getting away.

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:59.376
Harold, what the hell!
Whoa...

01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:03.626
- Help me.
- What can I do?

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.792
Grab on to me.

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:09.876
- Don't let go.
- Don't worry, Roger.

01:10:09.917 --> 01:10:11.876
I'll hold on to you
if it's the last thing I...

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:13.626
(Roger screaming)

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:14.876
..do!

01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:17.084
(Line unwinding)

01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:23.584
(Roger grunting)

01:10:23.626 --> 01:10:25.584
(Line whirring)

01:10:37.001 --> 01:10:38.584
(Whirring stops)

01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:41.876
Huh!

01:10:41.917 --> 01:10:44.751
(Animals chattering)

01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:46.876
(Roger grunting)

01:10:51.126 --> 01:10:53.251
(Gasping for air)

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.376
(Distant explosions)

01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:58.792
Jimmy!

01:10:58.834 --> 01:11:00.792
(Explosion)

01:11:01.626 --> 01:11:03.667
(Groaning)

01:11:08.084 --> 01:11:10.709
(Continues groaning)

01:11:13.376 --> 01:11:15.876
(Ben gasping)

01:11:16.126 --> 01:11:18.084
(Ben groaning)

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:22.751
(Whispers) You gotta be quiet
cos they're gonna hear your voice, OK?

01:11:22.917 --> 01:11:25.501
Finish me off, Roger.

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:27.876
I ain't gonna make it.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.626
Finish me off.

01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:34.667
I'm dying, Rog. Kill me.

01:11:35.626 --> 01:11:37.917
(Moaning) Finish me off.

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:42.792
Ah!

01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:52.626
(Sobbing) I can't do it.

01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:55.542
- Kill me.
- I can't do it.

01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:58.917
Kill me. I'm hurt.

01:11:59.917 --> 01:12:01.667
Ben, I'm gonna go get help.

01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:03.959
- Ben, I'm gonna go get help.
- No!

01:12:04.001 --> 01:12:06.876
- I'll get the troop, come back for you.
- No!

01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:08.251
Ben...

01:12:08.334 --> 01:12:10.626
I'll come back for you.

01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:12.876
(Sobs)

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:15.251
(Gunfire)

01:12:15.792 --> 01:12:16.959
(Explosion)

01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:18.917
(Excited voices)

01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:22.959
Ben!

01:12:23.001 --> 01:12:24.917
(Ben) Roger!

01:12:25.292 --> 01:12:27.501
I'll get you for this!

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:29.209
I swear I will!

01:12:33.501 --> 01:12:35.334
(Screaming) Roger!

01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:38.459
(Gunfire)

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:40.917
(Enemy voices)

01:13:07.167 --> 01:13:09.209
Harold. I'm back.

01:13:10.292 --> 01:13:13.084
(Roger yelling) Harold! Wait, it's me.

01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:16.334
- It's Roger.
- Roger?

01:13:16.376 --> 01:13:17.876
It's really you?

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:19.501
- Thank God!
- Oh!

01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:25.917
Raccoon, Rog?

01:13:32.917 --> 01:13:34.334
(Sighs)

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:38.917
(Whispers) Good night, Harold.

01:14:04.042 --> 01:14:05.584
(Sighs)

01:14:20.251 --> 01:14:21.751
(Gasps)

01:14:52.292 --> 01:14:54.292
(Wind howls)

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:03.084
(Crash)

01:15:21.501 --> 01:15:23.376
(Roaring)

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:25.417
(Growling)

01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:31.334
Agh.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:52.917
(Screams)

01:16:11.917 --> 01:16:13.751
(Panting)

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:15.751
(Jimmy yelling) Help!

01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:17.917
Jimmy.

01:16:18.917 --> 01:16:19.667
Jimmy.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.667
(Voice echoes)

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:28.042
Jimmy?

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:45.251
(Screeching)

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:46.917
(Screams)

01:17:48.542 --> 01:17:50.167
(Screeching)

01:18:03.167 --> 01:18:04.917
(Screeching)

01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:23.834
(Screeching)

01:18:26.542 --> 01:18:27.792
(Gunshot)

01:18:27.834 --> 01:18:29.584
Aagh!

01:18:52.251 --> 01:18:53.501
Jimmy!

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:10.709
(Jungle creatures calling)

01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:38.751
Oh, my God.

01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:42.959
Dad!

01:19:45.001 --> 01:19:46.917
(Sobbing) Oh, Dad!

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.917
I wanna go home.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:53.834
(Sobbing)

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:59.292
- He's coming back.
- Who?

01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:02.209
(Rapid gunfire)

01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:07.917
(Gunfire)

01:20:11.501 --> 01:20:14.251
Come on.

01:20:22.542 --> 01:20:24.501
(Gunfire)

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:39.459
Oh, Dad!

01:20:45.959 --> 01:20:47.709
(Laughing)

01:21:07.751 --> 01:21:09.376
Sucker!

01:21:11.292 --> 01:21:15.001
- Big Ben?
- No, it's your fairy godmother.

01:21:18.334 --> 01:21:20.876
- You...
- (Laughing)

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:23.626
You did this. You took my kid.

01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:27.459
Why didn't you kill me, Roger?
Didn't you have the guts to do it?

01:21:27.501 --> 01:21:30.834
- I had to get help.
- They tortured me for weeks.

01:21:30.876 --> 01:21:36.001
- I would have died for you, Ben.
- Well, now's your chance.

01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:38.751
No!

01:21:40.334 --> 01:21:43.334
Jimmy, I want you to get out of the house.
Get help.

01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:46.667
I'll keep him here.
Now go on, hurry up.

01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:49.251
(Door rattling)

01:21:51.459 --> 01:21:53.084
Oh!

01:21:53.126 --> 01:21:56.126
You're pissing me off, Roger.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.584
(Gunfire)

01:22:14.459 --> 01:22:17.417
Roger, you hit like a little girl.

01:22:57.459 --> 01:23:00.792
I've been waiting years for this, Roger.

01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:03.709
(Gunfire)

01:23:07.209 --> 01:23:11.626
Damn! Came back from the grave
and ran out of ammunition.

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:22.209
(Grunting)

01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:43.792
(Grunts)

01:24:21.209 --> 01:24:22.417
(Yells)

01:24:27.209 --> 01:24:28.209
Roger!

01:24:29.042 --> 01:24:30.792
Ugh!

01:24:55.917 --> 01:24:58.584
You can't get rid of me, Roger.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:01.042
Can't and you never will!

01:25:02.001 --> 01:25:03.751
(Yelling)

01:25:21.084 --> 01:25:24.792
Come on, Roger.
Is that all you can do, you wimp?

01:25:27.751 --> 01:25:29.209
(Ben laughs)

01:25:34.626 --> 01:25:36.417
(Laughing)

01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:38.834
Roger!

01:25:38.876 --> 01:25:40.917
Where you going, pal?

01:25:45.001 --> 01:25:46.667
Agh!

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:12.626
You lost, buddy!

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:15.917
Ben, don't!
(Screams)

01:26:19.917 --> 01:26:21.917
(Laughing)

01:26:26.751 --> 01:26:29.334
So long, sucker!

01:26:30.167 --> 01:26:31.917
(Laughing)

01:26:34.376 --> 01:26:36.334
Agh!

01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:43.709
Son of a bitch!

01:27:01.001 --> 01:27:02.584
(Jimmy) Dad!

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:05.167
Jimmy!

01:27:12.626 --> 01:27:13.917
Jimmy!

01:27:16.501 --> 01:27:17.626
Jim?

01:27:21.292 --> 01:27:22.876
(Jimmy) Dad!

01:27:27.584 --> 01:27:29.084
Think you're funny, Roger?

01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:33.751
A few years ago
you had a chance to kill me.

01:27:33.792 --> 01:27:37.542
Now, I'm going to kill your little boy,
unless you kill yourself.

01:27:37.584 --> 01:27:39.667
- No!
- Daddy!

01:27:39.751 --> 01:27:44.126
It's finally over, Roger.
You've got no chance.

01:27:45.584 --> 01:27:47.334
(Thud on floor)

01:27:53.417 --> 01:27:56.084
I'm not afraid of you any more, Ben.

01:27:57.667 --> 01:27:59.376
I beat you

01:27:59.417 --> 01:28:01.709
and this goddamn house.

01:28:01.751 --> 01:28:04.709
- Don't make me mad. I...
- You what?

01:28:04.751 --> 01:28:06.876
I'm warning you, I'll slit his throat.

01:28:06.917 --> 01:28:08.626
You can't hurt me

01:28:08.667 --> 01:28:10.042
or my son.

01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:12.959
- Come on, Jimmy.
- I'm warning you!

01:28:15.209 --> 01:28:18.209
- No! No!
- So long, sucker!

01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:20.042
No, Roger. No!

01:28:20.084 --> 01:28:21.917
I'll get you for this.

01:28:22.917 --> 01:28:25.167
