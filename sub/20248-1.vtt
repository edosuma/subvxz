Together again

02:03.341 --> 02:06.378
Gee, it's good to be together again

02:08.661 --> 02:12.097
I just can't imagine
That you've ever been gone

02:12.461 --> 02:16.090
It's not starting over
It's just going on

02:16.341 --> 02:18.093
Together again

02:18.661 --> 02:23.416
Now we're here and there's
No need remembering when

02:23.941 --> 02:27.980
'Cause no feeling feels
Like that feeling

02:28.741 --> 02:30.379
Together again

02:35.461 --> 02:37.019
Together again

02:37.261 --> 02:39.570
Gee, it's good to be together again

02:41.141 --> 02:43.814
I just can't imagine
That you've ever been gone

02:44.061 --> 02:46.655
It's not starting over
It's just going on

02:46.941 --> 02:48.579
Together again

02:48.781 --> 02:51.693
Now we're here and there's
No need remembering when

02:52.461 --> 02:55.578
'Cause no feeling feels
Like that feeling

02:56.261 --> 02:57.410
Together a...

02:57.661 --> 02:58.810
Together a...

02:59.181 --> 03:00.455
Together a...

03:02.061 --> 03:05.815
Together again

03:06.341 --> 03:08.059
Together again

03:15.261 --> 03:16.614
Thank you, thank you!

03:31.741 --> 03:33.379
- They like it.
- They love it!

03:33.621 --> 03:37.375
They're still applauding! Kermie,
you have to go out and take a bow!

03:38.221 --> 03:40.689
Kermit! Kermit! Kermit!

03:47.181 --> 03:48.853
Thank you! Thank you.

03:51.461 --> 03:55.454
Thank you. I really don't know what
to say, except we're really glad...

03:55.661 --> 03:58.539
...you liked Manhattan Melodies.
We all worked hard...

03:58.741 --> 04:01.175
...to make it the best
Senior Variety Show ever.

04:02.341 --> 04:05.538
Hey, Kermit! Next time
we'll see you on Broadway!

04:06.581 --> 04:08.378
Yeah, sure.

04:08.941 --> 04:10.818
That's a great idea!

04:11.061 --> 04:13.575
Let's take Manhattan Melodies
to New York!

04:14.581 --> 04:17.300
Broadway is dying to get
a great musical like this.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.053
Broadway?

04:19.261 --> 04:21.899
Thanks, everybody, for having
so much faith in us.

04:22.141 --> 04:25.690
It's not often that a frog and a bear
and a pig and a chicken...

04:26.341 --> 04:29.333
...and a whatever even get accepted
into college.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.777
We're all so proud to be
graduating now.

04:32.261 --> 04:33.819
Some with honours...

04:34.461 --> 04:37.737
Woman! Woman! Woman!

04:39.461 --> 04:40.337
Woman!

04:42.661 --> 04:46.051
And some with the help
of daily psychological counselling.

04:47.981 --> 04:50.176
Anyway, thank you again.

04:50.381 --> 04:52.372
Thank you for everything, guys.

04:56.021 --> 04:57.773
Broadway?

04:59.181 --> 05:01.820
But this show's not good enough
for Broadway.

05:02.061 --> 05:06.577
And the script needs a lot of work.
I still think something's missing.

05:07.781 --> 05:12.252
Remember you said we could not
get married until we had enough money?

05:12.781 --> 05:16.820
Well, we'd have enough
if we had a hit on Broadway!

05:18.141 --> 05:20.496
- Broadway of what city?
- Gonzo!

05:20.741 --> 05:22.299
What did I say?

05:22.541 --> 05:26.295
Even if the show was good enough,
we're all just graduating.

05:26.541 --> 05:28.179
What about our future plans?

05:28.421 --> 05:30.377
Well, this could be our future!

05:30.861 --> 05:33.216
- That's right!
- And if we don't do it...

05:33.461 --> 05:35.577
...we just say goodbye to each other.

05:36.141 --> 05:38.974
Broadway! Broadway! Broadway!

05:40.181 --> 05:44.015
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go to Broadway!

05:49.941 --> 05:51.579
New York!

05:51.861 --> 05:53.010
Look at everything!

05:53.261 --> 05:56.378
Well, we made it, guys.
We're really here!

05:57.461 --> 05:58.940
What a great-looking place!

05:59.141 --> 06:01.530
And it's filled with New Yorkers.
Look at them.

06:01.981 --> 06:04.973
Wowee! Isn't this great?

06:05.661 --> 06:09.176
Well, we better dump our stuff
and find a place to stay.

06:15.381 --> 06:18.771
- Scooter, break out the quarters.
- Yes, sir.

06:24.781 --> 06:26.214
What do you think, guys?

06:26.461 --> 06:27.610
How do you like it?

06:27.861 --> 06:30.375
Much better than
that cement mixer I lived in.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.249
I'll trade with anyone
that has a Jacuzzi.

06:33.781 --> 06:38.013
Come on, it's just for one day.
We'll all be on Broadway tomorrow.

06:48.861 --> 06:51.534
- We'd like to see Mr. Price.
- Do you have an appointment?

06:51.741 --> 06:55.336
No. But we've got this great show
called Manhattan Melodies...

06:55.541 --> 06:57.418
...that he'll wanna produce
on Broadway.

06:57.661 --> 06:59.970
It's about kids that come
to New York to marry...

07:00.181 --> 07:03.173
...and has a wonderful opening number
that goes like this...

07:03.621 --> 07:05.691
Hold it. Hold it.

07:06.061 --> 07:08.211
What's going on out there?

07:08.461 --> 07:11.021
Just a frog with a musical, Mr. Price.

07:11.261 --> 07:13.377
A musical? Send him in.

07:16.861 --> 07:18.613
Net, I'm talking net.

07:18.861 --> 07:20.977
You gotta be kidding with gross.

07:21.461 --> 07:22.610
Nice upholstery.

07:22.861 --> 07:25.580
Hold it a minute.
I'll get back to you.

07:26.381 --> 07:30.169
Mr. Price, I'm Kermit, and these are
my friends. We've got a show...

07:30.381 --> 07:32.531
...that you'll wanna produce
on Broadway.

07:32.741 --> 07:35.175
It's about kids that come
to New York to marry...

07:35.381 --> 07:37.975
...and it opens with a number
that goes like this...

07:38.981 --> 07:40.619
Look at me, here I am

07:40.861 --> 07:44.774
Frog, frog! No singing, okay?
Just give me the general idea.

07:44.981 --> 07:48.132
- It's all about life in the big city.
- In the big city?

07:48.341 --> 07:50.809
With cops, shootings, car chases?

07:51.061 --> 07:54.974
Well, no. No shooting stuff.
It's more like songs and dances.

07:55.381 --> 07:57.372
Songs and dances?

07:58.661 --> 08:00.379
That might be interesting.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.256
Nobody cares about shootings anyway.

08:04.261 --> 08:06.138
Are you thinking big-name stars?

08:06.341 --> 08:08.138
Actually, we're gonna be the stars.

08:09.141 --> 08:12.451
That's exactly what I was about
to say. You be the stars.

08:13.061 --> 08:13.937
Unknowns.

08:14.141 --> 08:16.257
Songs, dances, shootings.

08:17.741 --> 08:19.174
No shootings.

08:20.141 --> 08:21.369
You know what?

08:21.661 --> 08:23.379
I smell something.

08:25.581 --> 08:27.731
Why does everyone always blame dogs?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.250
No, no. What I smell is a hit.
A hit!

08:30.461 --> 08:31.780
You mean?

08:32.020 --> 08:33.010
Absolutely.

08:33.260 --> 08:36.856
I'd be proud to produce your show.
You're gonna be on Broadway!

08:38.541 --> 08:40.259
Hey, Kermit, we did it!

08:42.101 --> 08:45.411
Thanks, Mr. Price.
But I'd like you to read the script.

08:45.621 --> 08:47.498
There's still something missing...

08:47.741 --> 08:50.414
Don't worry. We fix those things
in the previews.

08:50.661 --> 08:53.812
I've gotta call the papers,
rent a theatre...

08:54.021 --> 08:55.659
...and I need $300 from you.

08:57.141 --> 08:58.460
$300?

08:58.741 --> 09:00.174
Yeah. Apiece.

09:00.421 --> 09:01.979
Apiece?

09:02.221 --> 09:03.290
Today. Yeah.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.576
What?

09:08.981 --> 09:11.700
Fellas, that's standard
Broadway procedure.

09:11.941 --> 09:14.216
You give me money,
we start rehearsals tomorrow.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.618
- But we don't have...
- Kermie, I don't think that's right.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.294
Now I smell something!

09:22.061 --> 09:25.576
There are two police officers outside.
They'd like to speak to you.

09:28.461 --> 09:30.577
That's him. That's Murray Plotsky.

09:31.021 --> 09:32.773
I gave him my life savings.

09:33.021 --> 09:35.012
Murray? I thought his name
was Martin.

09:35.261 --> 09:37.934
Let's go, Murray.
You've pulled your last con job.

09:40.021 --> 09:41.773
I don't want any trouble.

09:42.821 --> 09:45.335
Get back! Get back,
or the chicken gets it!

09:45.821 --> 09:46.651
That's a threat?

09:46.861 --> 09:49.250
- Don't hurt her. Take me!
- Whatever you say!

09:51.981 --> 09:54.176
Get away from that door. Move!

09:54.821 --> 09:56.777
Let go of my nose!

09:57.261 --> 09:58.410
Watch it!

09:59.661 --> 10:00.616
You too!

10:03.181 --> 10:04.375
Easy!

10:34.021 --> 10:35.932
Get that chicken off my ear!

10:45.661 --> 10:49.290
Get him off my ear!

10:51.341 --> 10:53.332
Bad man! Bad man!

10:53.741 --> 10:54.571
Way to go!

10:54.781 --> 10:56.772
Where were you when I needed you?

10:57.061 --> 10:59.017
Animals! You're crazy, all of you!

10:59.261 --> 11:01.536
And I want my money back!

11:02.861 --> 11:04.772
Gonzo, are you okay?

11:06.021 --> 11:09.570
I just saw my whole life flash
before my nose.

11:10.261 --> 11:11.171
Camilla!

11:11.421 --> 11:15.175
She's hyperventilating! She needs
mouth-to-beak resuscitation!

11:16.421 --> 11:19.572
Kermit, he never wanted our show.
He just wanted our money.

11:19.781 --> 11:22.090
Gonzo, is Camilla all right?

11:22.341 --> 11:23.979
Yeah, but I think we're engaged.

11:24.221 --> 11:26.815
Come on, we're gonna get
this show on Broadway!

11:27.061 --> 11:29.177
Come on, yeah! Let's go, guys!

11:41.461 --> 11:44.021
You can't take no for an answer

11:44.661 --> 11:47.129
You can't take no for an answer

11:47.781 --> 11:50.375
You can't take no for an answer

11:50.621 --> 11:51.656
No, no, no

11:57.261 --> 11:59.729
Whenever there's a dream
Worth a-dreamin'

12:00.221 --> 12:02.655
And you wanna see
That dream come true

12:03.141 --> 12:06.213
There'll be plenty people talkin'
Say forget all about it

12:06.461 --> 12:08.338
Say it isn't worth the trouble

12:08.541 --> 12:11.135
All the trouble
That you're goin' through

12:11.461 --> 12:12.814
Well, what can you do?

12:13.061 --> 12:15.495
You can't take no for an answer

12:16.221 --> 12:18.689
You can't take no for an answer

12:19.421 --> 12:21.889
You can't take no for an answer

12:22.141 --> 12:23.415
No, no, no

12:29.061 --> 12:31.814
What you gonna do
When the times get tough

12:32.061 --> 12:34.575
And the world's treating you unkind?

12:34.821 --> 12:38.052
You've gotta hang onto
Your optimistic outlook

12:38.261 --> 12:41.731
And keep possession
Of your positive state of mind

12:44.661 --> 12:47.050
You can't take no for an answer

12:47.781 --> 12:50.341
You can't take no for an answer

12:50.981 --> 12:53.495
You can't take no for an answer

12:53.821 --> 12:55.459
No, no, no

12:56.861 --> 12:58.658
No, no, no

13:00.061 --> 13:01.699
No, no, no

13:03.261 --> 13:05.013
No, no, no

13:20.461 --> 13:24.170
This is turning out to be
a little tougher than I thought.

13:24.421 --> 13:28.209
Kermit, I'm not good at this.
I don't take rejection well.

13:28.821 --> 13:32.780
Maybe we'd sell the show with more
special effects, like exploding socks.

13:32.981 --> 13:36.610
- Oh, Gonzo. Like, that's a lame idea.
- Oh, yeah?

13:36.861 --> 13:39.421
- Stop yelling at her.
- He wasn't yelling.

13:39.661 --> 13:41.970
- Yes, I was.
- Gonzo, don't make trouble.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.610
Fight! Fight! Fight!

13:45.661 --> 13:49.370
- Kermit, should we change the script?
- Yeah, what should we do?

13:50.101 --> 13:51.580
I don't know!

13:51.781 --> 13:53.009
How should I know?

13:53.221 --> 13:56.452
Why are you always asking me?
Can't you take care of yourselves?

13:56.821 --> 13:59.733
I don't know what to do next.
We failed, okay?

14:00.341 --> 14:02.377
We tried and we failed.

14:02.861 --> 14:05.011
Scooter, how much money
do we have left?

14:05.221 --> 14:07.781
Enough for two nights,
unless we find cheaper lockers.

14:09.621 --> 14:11.373
Well, we have to eat.

14:12.541 --> 14:14.179
Why start now?

14:16.861 --> 14:18.579
Gangway! Coming through!

14:18.821 --> 14:20.971
Hey, watch it, will you?

14:21.781 --> 14:23.578
Hey, that waiter's a rat.

14:23.781 --> 14:27.774
I'm glad we got no money.
Now I ain't got no appetite.

14:29.741 --> 14:32.414
One cheeseburger platter.
What do you want to drink?

14:32.661 --> 14:34.379
A glass of milk.

14:35.061 --> 14:37.529
I would like some meat in here.

14:37.861 --> 14:40.773
Picky, picky!
Hey, Pete! Where's the beef?

14:41.341 --> 14:43.616
It's coming! Got two hands only!

14:46.941 --> 14:48.215
What'll you have?

14:48.461 --> 14:50.816
The number for the Board of Health.

14:51.061 --> 14:52.130
That does it!

14:52.341 --> 14:55.299
Another rat crack, right?
Well, I got feelings too!

14:55.541 --> 14:57.975
Do you think I'm doing
this as a hobby?

14:58.181 --> 15:00.172
You wanna know
what I make around here?

15:00.381 --> 15:01.780
Nothing! Nothing!

15:01.981 --> 15:03.699
I live on tips!

15:03.941 --> 15:05.090
I work hard!

15:05.341 --> 15:09.573
I try to get tips to feed
my family and my mother.

15:10.021 --> 15:11.977
It just isn't fair.

15:13.261 --> 15:16.970
We understand.
We don't have any money either.

15:17.861 --> 15:20.170
Sorry. Not my table.

15:21.341 --> 15:22.456
What a rat!

15:23.741 --> 15:25.971
I'll get us something to eat.

15:26.381 --> 15:28.417
Is patty coming!
Is cow juice coming!

15:28.661 --> 15:30.379
Rizzo, where's Jenny?

15:30.581 --> 15:32.572
May I see a menu, please?

15:33.621 --> 15:35.896
Is special today: Yankee bean soup...

15:36.141 --> 15:37.574
...with spoon.

15:38.821 --> 15:40.493
Sorry I'm late, Pop.

15:40.741 --> 15:41.969
Hi, Fran. How are you?

15:42.181 --> 15:44.570
It went longer than I thought.

15:44.781 --> 15:47.375
But you will be so proud of me.
I did great!

15:47.581 --> 15:51.972
And it was all essay questions.
No sweat. I know I passed.

15:52.181 --> 15:53.978
Oh, Jenny, that's very good.

15:54.181 --> 15:55.978
Is cow juice and patty for lady.

15:56.181 --> 15:57.216
Rizzo, I'm back.

15:57.981 --> 16:00.131
It's about time.
I can't handle everybody!

16:00.341 --> 16:02.775
You can take the weirdos
at table four.

16:03.821 --> 16:05.857
Which one do you think is table four?

16:06.061 --> 16:10.339
I wonder if Kermie really meant it.
I mean, about failing.

16:10.541 --> 16:13.180
Those producers looked at us
like we were from outer space.

16:13.821 --> 16:14.776
What?

16:15.021 --> 16:17.979
No, man, go back to sleep.
Nobody's landed.

16:19.941 --> 16:22.774
- We'll take 11 bowls, please.
- Okey-dokey.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.699
But there's just one thing.

16:24.941 --> 16:28.411
We've got this great show
that's gonna be a big hit on Broadway.

16:32.141 --> 16:34.177
But right now, we're all broke.

16:34.421 --> 16:36.776
You mean, you don't have
any money at all?

16:36.981 --> 16:38.619
Well, not really. No.

16:38.821 --> 16:41.574
But we'd work it off. We promise.

16:41.781 --> 16:43.772
- Waitress!
- Coming!

16:45.661 --> 16:47.572
I tell you what is.

16:47.981 --> 16:49.175
Big city.

16:49.741 --> 16:51.777
Live, work, huh?

16:52.181 --> 16:54.536
But, not city open.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.939
Only peoples.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.779
Peoples is peoples.

16:59.021 --> 17:00.613
No is buildings.

17:00.861 --> 17:02.613
Is tomatoes, huh?

17:02.861 --> 17:03.976
Is peoples...

17:04.221 --> 17:07.213
...is dancing, is music, is potatoes!

17:10.421 --> 17:13.015
So peoples is peoples, okay?

17:16.221 --> 17:18.973
Thanks. That helped a lot.

17:24.421 --> 17:25.773
Where you going?

17:28.021 --> 17:29.818
Won't you wait for your soup?

17:30.061 --> 17:34.816
- But I told you, we don't have...
- Yeah, I know, but I know my pop.

17:35.061 --> 17:38.770
When he started out in this city,
he didn't have anything either.

17:39.061 --> 17:42.178
I bet he's back there getting
soup bowls for everybody.

17:42.381 --> 17:44.053
Really? With soup in them?

17:45.341 --> 17:48.890
I gotta get back to work. I had a
test today, so I came in late.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.376
Yeah, I heard you passed the test.

17:51.861 --> 17:56.616
I hope I passed. It's for acceptance
into a fashion-design college.

17:56.821 --> 18:00.177
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
we just graduated from college.

18:01.061 --> 18:02.414
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:02.661 --> 18:03.650
My name's Jenny.

18:03.861 --> 18:05.419
Hi, I'm Kermit.

18:05.621 --> 18:07.532
Hi, Kermit. Nice to meet you.

18:07.741 --> 18:08.969
I'm a frog.

18:16.141 --> 18:20.293
Listen, all I'm saying is maybe
it's time we went out on our own.

18:20.501 --> 18:24.176
You mean, out on our own alone?
Without even each other even?

18:24.421 --> 18:27.857
The frog's right.
We do depend on him too much.

18:28.061 --> 18:30.211
He feels too responsible for us.

18:30.461 --> 18:32.816
Man, he'd be better off
if we left town.

18:33.021 --> 18:35.251
I can't leave Kermit.
We're still pinned.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.896
I'm sorry I blew up outside.

18:42.141 --> 18:45.736
But guess what?
Pete's cooking up some soup for us.

18:51.061 --> 18:52.574
Well, what's wrong?

18:53.221 --> 18:54.574
It's just...

18:54.981 --> 18:57.575
We've had some job offers. Right?

19:01.621 --> 19:02.895
Well, that's great.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.376
Well, these job offers are...

19:05.981 --> 19:08.575
...they're kind of out-of-town.
Right?

19:12.341 --> 19:13.774
What job did I get?

19:16.181 --> 19:17.739
Piggy, are you going too?

19:17.941 --> 19:19.579
Well, Kermie, I...

19:24.621 --> 19:26.577
We go bye-bye?

19:27.461 --> 19:30.578
We'll all write to you
and let you know where we are.

19:30.781 --> 19:33.932
Yeah, and Kermit,
we still believe in the show.

19:41.661 --> 19:43.379
Aboard!

19:50.181 --> 19:55.096
Saying goodbye
Going away

19:55.621 --> 20:00.536
Seems like goodbye's
Such a hard thing to say

20:00.901 --> 20:05.577
Touching a hand
Wondering why

20:06.101 --> 20:10.572
It's time for saying goodbye

20:14.301 --> 20:16.019
Goodbye, Kermie!

20:16.261 --> 20:17.614
Piggy!

20:18.181 --> 20:19.250
Bye!

20:19.501 --> 20:21.059
Goodbye!

20:32.461 --> 20:37.376
Saying goodbye
Why is it sad?

20:37.821 --> 20:42.611
Makes us remember
The good times we've had

20:43.301 --> 20:47.977
Much more to say
Foolish to try

20:48.501 --> 20:52.335
It's time for saying goodbye

20:56.381 --> 21:01.216
Don't want to leave
But we both know

21:01.621 --> 21:04.977
Sometimes it's better to go

21:06.981 --> 21:11.896
Somehow I know
We'll meet again

21:12.381 --> 21:17.091
Not sure quite where
And I don't know just when

21:17.501 --> 21:22.416
You're in my heart
So until then

21:22.861 --> 21:27.013
It's time for saying goodbye

21:38.501 --> 21:43.416
Somehow I know
We'll meet again

21:44.061 --> 21:48.976
Not sure quite where
And I don't know just when

21:49.301 --> 21:54.216
You're in my heart
So until then

21:54.781 --> 21:57.090
Wanna smile

21:57.501 --> 21:59.457
Wanna cry

21:59.701 --> 22:03.694
Saying goodbye

22:06.861 --> 22:11.139
It's time for saying goodbye

23:16.981 --> 23:18.937
Look at all those people out there.

23:21.461 --> 23:23.019
Lots of people.

23:24.701 --> 23:26.419
But my friends...

23:27.661 --> 23:29.413
...my friends are all gone.

23:32.981 --> 23:35.211
Well, I'm gonna get them back.

23:36.861 --> 23:38.613
I'm gonna get them back.

23:38.901 --> 23:42.735
Because the show's not dead
as long as I believe in it.

23:42.941 --> 23:45.250
And I'm gonna sell that show.

23:45.501 --> 23:47.810
And we're all gonna be on Broadway.

23:48.821 --> 23:50.413
You hear me, New York?

23:50.621 --> 23:52.259
We're gonna be on Broadway!

23:52.501 --> 23:55.220
Because I'm not giving up!

23:55.661 --> 23:58.698
I'm still here and I'm staying!
You hear that, New York?

23:59.621 --> 24:01.213
I'm staying here!

24:01.461 --> 24:03.611
The frog is staying!

24:11.061 --> 24:12.813
- Hi, Jenny.
- Kermit! Hi!

24:13.061 --> 24:15.859
Rizzo, is bagel with schmeer
and hominy grit ready.

24:16.061 --> 24:20.020
Excuse me? Do you have some work
I could help you out with?

24:20.221 --> 24:23.452
- Rizzo, is ready.
- Part-time, so I can work on my show.

24:23.701 --> 24:25.612
What is that stuff supposed to be?

24:25.821 --> 24:28.210
Is grits. Grits. Hominy grits!

24:28.461 --> 24:31.612
How should I know how many?
Count them yourself!

24:31.861 --> 24:32.771
What?

24:32.981 --> 24:35.051
- Listen, Pete.
- Wait, wait. Hey!

24:35.301 --> 24:36.097
What is?

24:36.301 --> 24:38.815
This whole morning like this.
You complain.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.939
You slow. You no take orders.
You lazy rat, you!

24:42.181 --> 24:45.730
Lazy rat? Okay, have it your way.
See if I care.

24:45.981 --> 24:49.018
I don't have to take this abuse.
I quit!

24:49.261 --> 24:52.810
Quit? You no can quit!
Is breakfast crowd!

24:53.061 --> 24:56.212
All right, don't beg. I'll stay.
But I need some help.

24:56.421 --> 24:58.412
Okay, this is it. Don't blow it!

24:58.621 --> 25:02.409
Pete, meet your new employees.
Say hello to Tatooey.

25:03.101 --> 25:04.853
- Masterson.
- Hello.

25:05.101 --> 25:07.820
- Chester.
- Oh, I feel terrible.

25:08.061 --> 25:09.574
And Yolanda.

25:10.021 --> 25:12.091
What a crazy body!

25:13.301 --> 25:16.099
Pete, about that job.
See, I was wondering...

25:16.341 --> 25:19.014
Wait, wait, wait! Is no good!

25:19.221 --> 25:22.850
Rats want job. Frog want job.
What next? Penguins?

25:23.341 --> 25:24.854
You have any jobs available?

25:26.581 --> 25:29.095
Well, excuse us for living!

25:31.421 --> 25:33.059
Everybody's waiting for food.

25:33.261 --> 25:34.819
Listen, I can work nights.

25:35.021 --> 25:38.218
Come on, Pete, give these guys
a break, all right?

25:38.821 --> 25:40.937
For gosh sake, I go crazy!

25:41.301 --> 25:43.861
Okay, okay, rats, you go to work.

25:44.581 --> 25:46.014
Wait, wait, wait.

25:46.261 --> 25:48.536
Listen. I tell you what is.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.131
Is no work, is dancing...

25:52.621 --> 25:55.055
...is cheese, is big shoes.

25:59.301 --> 26:01.212
All right, rats, you go to work.

26:01.781 --> 26:04.420
So, like, you got a boyfriend,
or what?

26:04.661 --> 26:07.459
There's nothing else?
I'll do anything. I'll sweep...

26:07.701 --> 26:09.931
We could always use help
in the kitchen.

26:10.181 --> 26:11.614
These dishes need washing.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.813
Oh, thanks, Pete!
That's terrific. Oh, boy!

26:16.701 --> 26:19.977
- Thanks a lot, Jenny.
- Hey, no sweat!

26:20.181 --> 26:22.012
So where are all your friends?

26:22.701 --> 26:24.214
They had to leave.

26:24.901 --> 26:26.129
Even your pig friend?

26:26.381 --> 26:28.258
Yes, but I'm bringing her back.

26:28.501 --> 26:31.220
I wrote the show, so when I sell it,
I can bring them back.

26:31.461 --> 26:34.214
I'm staying, and I'm getting
our show on Broadway.

26:34.421 --> 26:36.093
I really admire that.

26:36.301 --> 26:38.735
I'm gonna do something special too,
you know.

26:38.981 --> 26:40.619
I mean, in fashion.

26:40.861 --> 26:44.012
You know, maybe your fashion
designing can help me now.

26:44.701 --> 26:45.690
What do you mean?

26:45.901 --> 26:50.213
I did some reading about Broadway
producers and investors and agents...

26:50.421 --> 26:52.855
...and I know what I have to do
to sell our show.

26:53.101 --> 26:55.899
I can use your help,
because I have a three-part plan.

26:56.461 --> 26:58.019
And the first part is...

26:58.261 --> 27:01.014
...if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

27:28.861 --> 27:33.218
Hey, sweetheart! I just flew in
from the Coast. I love your hair!

27:33.461 --> 27:37.249
I got an appointment with, what's
his name, your top theatre agent.

27:37.501 --> 27:39.935
- Leonard Winesop?
- Yeah, Lennie, right.

27:40.181 --> 27:41.899
What office is he in again?

27:42.101 --> 27:44.569
He's in suite 1024,
but I'll call and see...

27:44.781 --> 27:47.659
No, that's okay, sweetheart.
No need for that...

27:47.901 --> 27:50.973
...because Lennie and I go way back.
I'm talking way back.

27:51.181 --> 27:53.615
You're too much. Far out! Right on!

27:59.181 --> 28:00.409
Mr. Winesop?

28:02.021 --> 28:03.249
A frog?

28:03.501 --> 28:05.219
With an Afro?

28:05.821 --> 28:08.051
Hi, Lennie!
I just flew in from the Coast.

28:08.301 --> 28:10.257
I love your office!
Don't change a thing.

28:10.501 --> 28:13.254
My private plane's double-parked,
so I gotta run.

28:13.501 --> 28:17.335
I got this boffo, socko script for
Broadway called Manhattan Melodies.

28:17.541 --> 28:21.056
It's totally today, yet tremendously
timeless. You get first look-see.

28:21.301 --> 28:22.654
Have I ever lied to you?

28:22.901 --> 28:26.450
I hear my beeper. I gotta split.
Have your people call my people.

28:26.701 --> 28:28.453
We'll take a meeting, all right?

28:28.701 --> 28:31.454
And remember, boffo, Lennie.
Socko, Lennie. Okay?

28:31.701 --> 28:33.498
We'll have lunch. Ciao!

28:58.421 --> 28:59.410
Hi, Jenny!

28:59.661 --> 29:01.333
Come here. Have a seat.

29:01.581 --> 29:04.414
Were you a hit? They loved it.
How'd the costume work?

29:04.621 --> 29:07.454
The costume was great,
but it's hard to tell how it went.

29:07.701 --> 29:10.613
They're probably reading
the script right now.

29:23.181 --> 29:24.455
Hey, baby.

29:24.861 --> 29:26.010
Baby!

29:26.821 --> 29:28.413
Where you going, sweetheart?

29:29.221 --> 29:30.813
Hello?

29:31.501 --> 29:34.015
I said, hello?

29:35.461 --> 29:40.012
For the next part of my plan, I have
to look older. I'll grow a mustache.

29:40.981 --> 29:42.812
You'd look cute with a mustache.

29:43.061 --> 29:44.016
You think so?

29:44.221 --> 29:45.893
Piggy said that to me once too.

29:46.101 --> 29:48.012
She's hot. Hot mama!

29:48.421 --> 29:49.695
Hot stuff!

29:50.821 --> 29:54.609
Looking good. Purple and pretty.
Pretty and purple.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.492
Sweet thing! Sweet thing!

29:58.701 --> 30:00.657
She must be really talented.

30:00.901 --> 30:02.812
Oh, I think you're talented too.

30:03.021 --> 30:03.817
You mean it?

30:04.021 --> 30:08.219
Of course. I know you're gonna be
a famous designer someday.

30:08.661 --> 30:11.778
Oh, Kermit, thank you for saying that.

30:11.981 --> 30:13.812
Come on, baby, don't be rude.

30:14.061 --> 30:15.653
Look here, now. Look here.

30:28.501 --> 30:29.820
What was that?

30:32.621 --> 30:34.418
It's just New York.

30:43.501 --> 30:45.298
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Wrightson.

30:47.901 --> 30:50.859
I would suggest that it is
neither prudent nor wise...

30:51.101 --> 30:55.060
...to be a half-hour late from lunch,
especially on your first day.

30:55.301 --> 30:56.416
Yes, sir.

30:56.661 --> 30:58.652
Eileen, sorry I'm late.

30:59.501 --> 31:02.379
It's okay. Everything's been
going wrong lately.

31:03.101 --> 31:06.411
Get your new French perfume here.
Quelle Différence!

31:06.981 --> 31:08.653
Is something wrong? Can we talk?

31:08.901 --> 31:11.574
- I'll be fine. I'll be just bien!
- Sorry.

31:12.421 --> 31:15.413
Get your Quelle Différence!
It's French! It's feminine!

31:15.661 --> 31:18.619
It'll help you grab one
of those rotten, stinking men!

31:18.821 --> 31:21.210
- Quelle Différence...
- Piggy, please!

31:21.461 --> 31:24.612
You were fine this morning.
Did something happen at lunch?

31:24.821 --> 31:26.618
My frog turned on me.

31:26.821 --> 31:29.619
Yeah, I had some bad tuna myself.

31:29.901 --> 31:31.812
I'm gonna fight for him though.

31:32.061 --> 31:34.291
Eileen, do you think I'm pretty?

31:34.501 --> 31:37.413
Of course you are.
You're more than pretty.

31:37.621 --> 31:39.020
Gorgeous?

31:39.981 --> 31:41.619
Don't push it, Pig.

31:43.101 --> 31:46.218
You're more than gorgeous, Piggy.
You're unique.

31:46.701 --> 31:49.818
But you know, you could use
a little rouge.

31:50.661 --> 31:52.014
Have a seat.

31:52.901 --> 31:55.051
- What are you doing?
- We'll fix you up.

31:55.301 --> 31:57.735
We'll make you look like a movie star.

31:57.981 --> 31:59.653
You need cheekbones.

31:59.861 --> 32:03.774
Your face is round, no offense.
I'll give you a complete makeup job.

32:03.981 --> 32:06.017
When you walked in,
I said, "She needs rouge."

32:06.261 --> 32:08.650
Turn your face.
Did you ever wear rouge?

32:08.901 --> 32:12.018
- Now you're gonna really wear rouge.
- Kermit won't care.

32:12.261 --> 32:14.616
Kermit, schmermit. Look.
You look great!

32:14.861 --> 32:17.056
It brings out your eyes.
Know what you need?

32:17.301 --> 32:19.417
- Eyebrows.
- Pigs don't have eyebrows.

32:19.621 --> 32:21.020
This pig is going to.

32:21.261 --> 32:23.013
And so is this.

32:24.061 --> 32:25.414
I'm giving you big eye...

32:25.661 --> 32:27.856
I think I overdid it.
Take a look.

32:28.101 --> 32:30.012
- You have it too.
- I have them too!

32:30.221 --> 32:32.655
- Do some more.
- I'll give you doe eyes.

32:32.901 --> 32:34.857
- What are doe eyes?
- Bambi eyes.

32:35.101 --> 32:36.978
- Let me see.
- Doe eyes!

32:37.181 --> 32:40.218
- Do some more.
- You need freckles for cutesy.

32:40.461 --> 32:43.055
- Freckles.
- Cutesy, cutesy, cutesy.

32:43.301 --> 32:45.019
And I'll be cutesy with you.

32:45.661 --> 32:46.650
You got it too.

32:46.901 --> 32:49.859
You know what?
Why don't you wear lipstick?

32:50.101 --> 32:51.454
Pucker. Pucker.

32:52.301 --> 32:55.134
This is just...
You look fabulous! Look at you.

32:55.381 --> 32:58.532
A little more on the cheeks.
And a little more on my cheeks!

33:00.741 --> 33:01.935
Powder puff for you!

33:02.181 --> 33:04.615
And a powder puff for me!

33:07.381 --> 33:09.417
Quelle Différence!
The newest perfume...

33:09.661 --> 33:11.891
You are fired!

33:17.821 --> 33:19.891
What happened to the rats
you had here?

33:20.141 --> 33:23.451
A customer complained.
They no like rats for waiters.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.453
But is okay. I make them cook.

33:25.701 --> 33:27.453
Hey, Pete. Here you go.

33:27.661 --> 33:31.813
Two zeros on a trampoline
with a side of Joan of Arcs!

34:07.861 --> 34:09.214
Hey, how's the coffee?

34:11.900 --> 34:15.018
The coffee's fine. Come on in!

34:32.661 --> 34:33.536
I said...

34:46.821 --> 34:50.052
Kermit, when are you gonna start
growing your mustache?

34:50.301 --> 34:53.418
I stopped shaving three days ago.
Didn't you notice?

34:56.460 --> 34:57.450
Well...

34:59.581 --> 35:01.811
Well, it's subtle.

35:02.861 --> 35:05.614
I bet we could help it along
with a little makeup.

35:05.821 --> 35:08.813
Good, because I'm ready for
the second part of my plan.

35:09.541 --> 35:10.974
Got mail for you.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.613
Must be from the gang.

35:15.821 --> 35:18.255
Now, Yolanda, chopping is an art.

35:18.501 --> 35:19.820
You gotta be...

35:20.061 --> 35:21.972
...smooth.

35:24.061 --> 35:26.211
Oh, hey, it's from Scooter!

35:26.581 --> 35:28.811
"Dear Kermit: How are you?"

35:29.021 --> 35:32.457
Have you sold the show yet?
Have you heard from the gang?

35:32.701 --> 35:35.056
I'm in Cleveland,
and I have a terrific job.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.651
I'm managing a huge movie house here.

35:37.901 --> 35:41.735
Well, maybe not managing, but I do
have a lot of responsibilities.

35:41.981 --> 35:44.814
- Here are your glasses. To the left.
- Hurry up, Mom.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.210
Thank you.

35:46.461 --> 35:48.816
And I'm meeting
some interesting people.

35:49.061 --> 35:50.813
The popping corn is...

35:51.061 --> 35:52.050
...3- D!

35:52.301 --> 35:55.816
The corn is popping in your face,
and it's 3-D!

35:56.021 --> 36:00.014
But, Chef, that's not
how 3-D works. Oh, never mind.

36:00.261 --> 36:02.013
Here's your ticket.

36:02.221 --> 36:05.133
Thanks. But, sir, your 3-D glasses!

36:05.381 --> 36:07.212
Sir, your glasses!

36:14.581 --> 36:16.811
Sir, don't you want your 3-D glasses?

36:17.061 --> 36:20.451
Oh, I don't need them.
I've seen this movie 97 times.

36:20.701 --> 36:24.455
My name is Lew Zealand.
I'm a boomerang fish-thrower.

36:24.701 --> 36:28.740
I throw the fish away,
and they come back to me.

36:28.981 --> 36:30.812
Oh, here's my favourite part.

36:31.021 --> 36:33.216
The fish are coming
from the game room!

36:33.421 --> 36:36.572
Oh, no! The killer fish
are attacking!

36:37.261 --> 36:38.614
Go get them, guys!

36:51.861 --> 36:54.739
So life is great here in Ohio.

36:54.981 --> 36:56.812
Love, Scooter.

36:57.101 --> 36:58.819
Here's one from Fozzie.

36:59.501 --> 37:02.015
"Dear Kermit: Wocka, wocka, wocka!"

37:02.261 --> 37:04.650
But seriously, I'm in Maine.

37:04.901 --> 37:07.131
My job didn't turn out
too terrific...

37:07.381 --> 37:09.815
...so I decided to hibernate.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.292
Ah, back to nature. I love it
out here in the woods.

37:13.901 --> 37:16.461
It's where a bear should be.

37:24.181 --> 37:26.820
How do they do it?

37:28.501 --> 37:31.220
I've been trying to sleep for days.

37:32.901 --> 37:35.017
Anybody got some warm milk?

37:35.821 --> 37:37.413
Oh, brother.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.814
Hello.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.656
I didn't know this cave was coed.

37:44.901 --> 37:46.459
My name's Beth.

37:46.701 --> 37:48.817
Hi, I'm Fozzie.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.858
I can't sleep either.

37:51.101 --> 37:53.217
Maybe if we snuggle...

37:57.621 --> 37:59.737
Kermit!

38:02.581 --> 38:04.458
Here's one more from Dr. Teeth.

38:04.701 --> 38:07.056
Dear Kermit: How's the man?

38:07.301 --> 38:10.259
We got this great gig here
outside of Pittsburgh.

38:17.021 --> 38:18.090
I tell you, frog...

38:18.581 --> 38:19.855
...the band's wailing...

38:20.181 --> 38:21.694
...the music's cooking.

38:21.901 --> 38:24.654
The crowd here is
also wailing and cooking.

38:24.901 --> 38:27.210
Yeah, we're in hip city here.

38:38.421 --> 38:40.298
They're all doing pretty well.

38:40.541 --> 38:41.656
Yeah, they are.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.297
But, you know, there are no letters
from Gonzo or Rowlf...

38:45.541 --> 38:46.576
...or Piggy.

38:46.821 --> 38:48.891
Oh, I'm sure they've written.

38:49.141 --> 38:51.496
Sometimes it just takes awhile.

38:51.741 --> 38:56.053
Yeah, sure. Piggy's probably busy
with some kind of terrific job.

38:57.461 --> 38:59.850
I guess they're all out there
doing terrific.

39:01.421 --> 39:04.094
If I could sell the show,
everyone could come back...

39:04.341 --> 39:07.060
...and we could do it together,
like in the old days.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.058
You'll do it, Kermit.

39:09.341 --> 39:11.252
Well, thanks, Jenny.

39:19.741 --> 39:21.891
That's been happening a lot lately.

39:22.141 --> 39:22.971
I know.

39:23.181 --> 39:24.853
It's New York.

39:25.661 --> 39:28.095
I'm ready for the second part
of my plan.

39:28.341 --> 39:31.174
I'm gonna need your help,
and the other rats too.

39:31.381 --> 39:33.941
I think we could be making
some overtime.

39:34.141 --> 39:36.974
- I need you to draw a picture of me.
- Sure!

39:37.221 --> 39:38.654
Okay, what's the scoop?

39:38.861 --> 39:41.659
Have you ever heard
of a whispering campaign?

40:01.061 --> 40:03.655
- Good afternoon.
- Kermit the Frog.

40:03.901 --> 40:07.052
My reservation secretary made...

40:07.261 --> 40:09.092
...a reservation for me.

40:10.621 --> 40:11.770
Gesundheit.

40:12.021 --> 40:13.579
This way, please.

40:16.141 --> 40:17.460
Afternoon, all.

40:20.101 --> 40:22.251
Don't get up. Keep eating.

40:28.021 --> 40:29.215
May I take your coat?

40:29.421 --> 40:31.059
No! That is...

40:31.301 --> 40:33.895
...no, thank you very much, indeed.

40:44.941 --> 40:47.250
That's the closest I wanna be
to a frog.

40:47.501 --> 40:49.617
- Okay, guys, do your stuff.
- Right!

41:01.541 --> 41:03.452
Okay, you start.

41:03.701 --> 41:06.932
Say, isn't that
that rich producer over there?

41:07.141 --> 41:09.814
The one who's investing
in Manhattan Melodies?

41:10.021 --> 41:13.172
Yes! He's investing
millions of dollars...

41:13.421 --> 41:15.218
...in Manhattan Melodies!

41:15.421 --> 41:18.652
What's that all about?
Manhattan Melodies, what's that?

41:18.901 --> 41:22.177
Isn't that Kermit the Frog,
the bigtime producer?

41:23.341 --> 41:24.296
A producer's here?

41:24.501 --> 41:27.857
A big producer, dear.
There's a big producer over there.

41:30.781 --> 41:33.056
It's the hottest thing coming
to Broadway!

41:37.021 --> 41:39.455
It's the best Broadway show
of the year.

41:54.461 --> 41:56.258
Vincent? Vincent?

41:57.501 --> 41:59.457
Did I do something wrong?

42:01.141 --> 42:02.096
Vincent...

42:02.341 --> 42:03.854
...a frog?

42:04.381 --> 42:07.851
- Gee, that food smells good up there.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

42:36.741 --> 42:39.016
But this is all a misunderstanding!

42:43.021 --> 42:45.251
Well, thanks a lot, you guys.

42:58.501 --> 43:01.061
So what's the third part
of your plan?

43:01.941 --> 43:04.057
I don't think there's gonna be one.

43:04.941 --> 43:08.251
I feel like I'm being a phony,
and I can't take it anymore.

43:09.701 --> 43:12.056
I don't know what to do next.

43:21.021 --> 43:22.136
All right!

43:22.661 --> 43:23.855
Moping time's over.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.092
How about a little exercise?

43:26.461 --> 43:28.452
I knew you wanted to.

43:29.221 --> 43:32.054
Oh, dear Lord, not jogging.

43:34.661 --> 43:37.459
Wow, it's such a beautiful day!

43:42.261 --> 43:43.660
Give me a break!

43:45.341 --> 43:47.093
Come on, let's go this way.

43:48.141 --> 43:49.494
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

43:49.741 --> 43:51.697
Good. Exercise does the trick.

43:51.941 --> 43:54.296
Yeah, stretch the old frog legs.

44:16.301 --> 44:17.575
My purse!

44:18.541 --> 44:20.099
That does it!

44:22.821 --> 44:25.699
Excuse me. May I borrow
those a moment?

44:56.261 --> 44:57.455
Piggy?

45:52.741 --> 45:53.969
You creep!

45:54.181 --> 45:55.170
Get off!

45:55.421 --> 45:57.855
I don't even know how to skate!
You know that?

45:58.101 --> 46:00.057
- What's going on?
- She stole my purse!

46:00.301 --> 46:02.861
- What?!
- Good try, fella. Come on!

46:03.061 --> 46:06.451
That'll teach you to mess
with a lady! Understand?!

46:06.701 --> 46:09.534
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you!

46:13.661 --> 46:16.300
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?

46:17.261 --> 46:18.489
Sightseeing.

46:18.741 --> 46:21.050
But you're supposed to be
out of town.

46:21.821 --> 46:25.450
I do not wish to discuss it
in present company.

46:28.661 --> 46:31.858
That's okay, Kermit.
I'll see you back at Pete's.

46:32.901 --> 46:35.461
I'm glad you're not hurt, Miss Piggy.

46:38.741 --> 46:40.459
Listen, what's going on?

46:40.661 --> 46:43.459
Well, you're certainly looking
different now.

46:43.701 --> 46:48.058
No gold chains, no shirt
cut to the navel, no toupee!

46:48.261 --> 46:49.899
Quelle différence!

46:50.141 --> 46:52.450
What's with all this French stuff?

46:53.261 --> 46:56.094
By sheer chance,
I happened to learn French...

46:56.341 --> 46:58.650
...and get a job interpreting
at the UN.

47:00.941 --> 47:02.772
Can I get my skates back, please?

47:03.021 --> 47:05.854
Just a second.
How did you know about that toupee?

47:06.101 --> 47:09.650
- None of your beeswax!
- Have you been spying on me?

47:09.861 --> 47:13.456
I'll unlace them while you fight.
It's no trouble.

47:13.661 --> 47:15.299
Have you been spying on me?

47:15.541 --> 47:20.456
Maybe spying on vous and that certain
young girl of the opposite gender.

47:20.741 --> 47:21.969
You two-timing her?

47:22.221 --> 47:24.052
No, it's just Jenny, a friend.

47:24.261 --> 47:26.297
She's trying to help me
sell the show!

47:26.541 --> 47:28.497
He's gotta sell the show.
What show?

47:28.741 --> 47:31.972
Well, if she is just a friend,
then what about...

47:32.221 --> 47:33.859
...the huggies?

47:34.421 --> 47:36.491
You gave Jenny the huggies?

47:36.741 --> 47:38.174
You know, maybe, Kermit...

47:38.421 --> 47:41.697
...maybe it would've been better
if we had never have met.

47:41.901 --> 47:45.894
Then you and Jenny would not be
tormented by my presence.

47:47.141 --> 47:48.460
See what the huggies get you?

47:48.701 --> 47:52.580
Jenny and I hugged because we're
friends. That's what friends do.

47:52.821 --> 47:54.652
Friends do not spy!

47:54.901 --> 47:56.459
I forgot about that.

47:56.661 --> 48:00.290
- I spied because I care!
- Well, I care too!

48:00.541 --> 48:02.657
- Why don't you say so?
- I just did!

48:02.901 --> 48:04.254
All right!

48:07.141 --> 48:08.369
Keep the skates.

48:08.621 --> 48:10.054
Keep the skates.

48:10.261 --> 48:13.651
I never use them anyway.
I just like to run around in shorts.

48:19.541 --> 48:21.259
Wait a minute!

48:22.621 --> 48:24.259
Come on, Piggy.

48:39.301 --> 48:41.861
Look, Waldorf.
It's the frog and the pig.

48:42.101 --> 48:44.456
Yeah, it looks like they're in love.

48:44.661 --> 48:46.856
Kind of makes you sick, doesn't it?

48:49.221 --> 48:50.495
Hey, lovey-dovey!

48:50.701 --> 48:52.259
Hubba-hubba!

48:52.781 --> 48:54.897
Kermie, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

48:55.141 --> 48:57.097
And I didn't mean it when I said...

48:57.301 --> 49:00.452
...that it would have been better
if we had never met.

49:00.661 --> 49:04.256
In fact, I wish we'd met much sooner.

49:08.941 --> 49:11.899
Just imagine.
Wouldn't it have been wonderful...

49:12.141 --> 49:14.974
...if we'd known each other
when we were little?

49:17.461 --> 49:18.860
Imagine...

49:19.621 --> 49:21.532
Little Kermie.

49:22.541 --> 49:24.850
Little Piggy.

49:36.941 --> 49:40.411
No matter what life may bring

49:40.901 --> 49:44.371
No matter what I may do

49:44.821 --> 49:47.813
Be sure of one special thing

49:48.341 --> 49:53.017
I'm gonna always be loving you

49:55.741 --> 49:58.016
Gonna be a movie star

49:58.501 --> 50:01.334
And I'm gonna learn to drive a car

50:01.661 --> 50:04.095
Gonna be a veterinarian too

50:04.341 --> 50:07.378
And I'm gonna always love you

50:18.141 --> 50:19.051
Hi, guys!

50:19.301 --> 50:20.290
Hi, Fozzie!

50:23.821 --> 50:26.858
I'll be the cutest model you ever saw

50:27.061 --> 50:30.098
And then I think
I'll study criminal law

50:30.341 --> 50:32.855
And I'm gonna learn to scuba dive too

50:33.061 --> 50:35.097
And I'm gonna always love you

50:47.141 --> 50:48.938
Well, I'm gonna be a singer

50:50.301 --> 50:53.134
And I'm gonna learn to fly a plane

50:53.341 --> 50:56.651
I'll be a doctor of diseases
I'll help you with your sneezes

50:56.901 --> 51:00.257
And practice neurosurgery
On your brain

51:01.181 --> 51:03.456
Gonna climb the Matterhorn

51:03.701 --> 51:06.852
But only after
All our children are born

51:07.061 --> 51:09.495
'Cause I want to be a good mommy too

51:09.741 --> 51:12.016
And I'm gonna always love you

51:23.501 --> 51:26.061
She's gonna be a movie star

51:26.301 --> 51:29.054
And she's gonna learn to drive a car

51:29.261 --> 51:32.094
She's gonna be a veterinarian too

51:32.301 --> 51:34.769
And I'm gonna always love you

51:36.701 --> 51:38.692
Well, she's gonna be a singer

51:39.861 --> 51:42.739
And she's gonna learn to fly a plane

51:43.021 --> 51:46.377
She'll be a doctor of diseases
And help you with your sneezes

51:46.581 --> 51:49.493
And practice neurosurgery
On your brain

51:50.701 --> 51:53.056
Gonna climb the Matterhorn

51:53.261 --> 51:56.458
But only after
All my children are born

51:56.661 --> 51:59.095
'Cause I want to be a good mommy too

51:59.341 --> 52:03.937
And I'm gonna always love you

52:17.341 --> 52:19.457
Piggy, I think the ride is over.

52:31.181 --> 52:33.854
- Bye, Jenny. See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

52:39.741 --> 52:41.777
Well, here we are.

52:42.021 --> 52:46.060
And it sure is nice that we're all
together like this, isn't it?

52:48.301 --> 52:49.290
Miss?

52:49.541 --> 52:50.974
- Is customer!
- Coming!

52:51.221 --> 52:55.533
Excuse me! I will get it.
After all, moi am a waitress.

52:56.861 --> 52:58.897
Pete, thanks for giving Piggy a job.

52:59.141 --> 53:02.099
Rats cooking, is frog washing,
is pig waitress!

53:02.341 --> 53:04.491
Is no coffee shop. Is zoo!

53:08.341 --> 53:10.650
Hey, Kermit, come on.

53:10.861 --> 53:13.500
What about the show?
What are we gonna do next?

53:13.741 --> 53:16.050
Is mailman come with letters for you.

53:16.261 --> 53:18.058
That must be more from the gang.

53:18.301 --> 53:20.451
I'll have two eggs, dry toast...

53:20.661 --> 53:22.458
Pardonnez-moi, dear.

53:27.821 --> 53:29.459
Is something wrong?

53:29.901 --> 53:33.211
Do you believe in interspecies dating?

53:33.421 --> 53:36.652
I've gone out with some rats,
if that's what you mean.

53:38.621 --> 53:40.771
- It's from Gonzo.
- Great!

53:41.021 --> 53:43.854
It goes, "Dear Kermit:
I'm in Michigan."

53:44.061 --> 53:46.700
Camilla and I have joined
a travelling aquacade.

53:46.941 --> 53:50.377
It's not Broadway, but I have met
some good-looking chickens.

53:50.581 --> 53:52.173
We put together a terrific act.

53:52.421 --> 53:53.900
Ladies and gentlemen!

53:54.181 --> 53:57.378
The incredible Gonzo!

53:57.901 --> 53:59.493
Thank you! Arriba!

53:59.741 --> 54:01.015
And, thank you!

54:01.221 --> 54:03.098
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd!

54:03.541 --> 54:06.135
And now, for today's climactic act...

54:06.341 --> 54:07.456
...look yonder!

54:07.701 --> 54:10.295
I will first make
a death-defying leap...

54:10.541 --> 54:12.259
...from the loop-de-loop ramp...

54:12.461 --> 54:17.091
...spinning and hurtling my body
through the flaming circle of doom...

54:17.341 --> 54:21.778
...and landing comfortably
on the imitation-leather easy chair...

54:22.021 --> 54:25.457
...while my chickens do
their impression of Tony Bennett...

54:25.661 --> 54:28.334
...singing the
"William Tell Overture."

54:28.941 --> 54:31.171
Please! I must have silence!

54:32.221 --> 54:34.371
Are you ready?

54:35.101 --> 54:36.853
Thank you, Margaret!

54:37.221 --> 54:38.779
Hit it, girls!

54:42.661 --> 54:44.253
Here we go!

54:44.541 --> 54:46.099
Oh, wait, I can't see.

54:50.821 --> 54:52.493
I forgot my skis!

54:52.741 --> 54:55.050
Don't sound like Tony Bennett to me.

54:55.821 --> 54:59.780
"So everything's going swimmingly.
Love, Gonzo."

55:00.421 --> 55:02.252
Hey, here's one from Rowlf.

55:02.461 --> 55:04.656
Dear Kermit: How's the Frog?

55:04.861 --> 55:08.171
I'm in Delaware, and I found
a terrific job in management.

55:08.421 --> 55:12.255
I'm surrounded by friends,
and I love what I'm doing.

55:18.101 --> 55:20.661
I am Mr. Skeffington.
My secretary made...

55:20.861 --> 55:24.058
...a reservation for the weekend
in the name of Snookums.

55:25.741 --> 55:27.140
Oh, yeah.

55:29.461 --> 55:31.452
This is Snookums.

55:34.701 --> 55:37.454
Daddy wants his little
Snookie-ookums...

55:37.661 --> 55:41.654
...to be especially good this weekend
while Daddy is gone...

55:41.901 --> 55:46.258
...or he'll be very angry.

55:46.461 --> 55:48.691
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.

55:48.941 --> 55:49.771
Him!

55:50.021 --> 55:52.660
- We'll take good care of him.
- Snookums is a him!

55:53.341 --> 55:56.174
Snookums gets breakfast
at 8 a.m. Exactly.

55:56.421 --> 55:58.935
- Breakfast is quiche.
- Yes, sir.

55:59.341 --> 56:01.059
Aren't you gonna write it down?

56:01.701 --> 56:03.214
Photographic memory.

56:03.941 --> 56:05.215
Write it down!

56:07.261 --> 56:08.580
"Dog gets quiche at 8."

56:08.781 --> 56:09.850
Whatever that is.

56:10.101 --> 56:11.853
Marvin, put him on the desk.

56:12.221 --> 56:14.576
Do you have any toys around here?

56:14.821 --> 56:17.460
What kind of toys would you like, sir?

56:17.741 --> 56:19.493
Doggy toys!

56:20.061 --> 56:23.895
Rubber balls. Rubber fire hydrants.
Rubber newspapers!

56:24.421 --> 56:28.858
Snookums prefers rubber Wall Street
Journal to the rubber Washington Post.

56:29.101 --> 56:30.819
Don't we all?

56:31.021 --> 56:32.090
Write it down.

56:32.341 --> 56:34.457
Yeah, rubber Wall Street Journal.

56:34.701 --> 56:37.090
Now, while Daddy is gone...

56:37.341 --> 56:41.300
...the little lumpy-dum-dums
won't have his Daddy...

56:41.541 --> 56:44.260
...to give him washy-scrubby.

56:45.701 --> 56:48.340
Very impressive.
You speak Chinese like a native.

56:49.581 --> 56:51.173
Now, shake hands.

56:51.421 --> 56:53.457
- Beg your pardon?
- Shake! Shake!

56:53.701 --> 56:55.100
Oh, yeah, yeah.

56:55.341 --> 56:57.855
Good boy! Now sit!

56:58.181 --> 56:58.977
Yes, sir.

56:59.621 --> 57:01.577
Stay. Stay.

57:10.021 --> 57:12.854
That was the most humiliating
experience of my life.

57:13.101 --> 57:16.093
Hey, Snookie! Hey, look
at little Snookie-ookums!

57:16.341 --> 57:19.492
Snookie-wookums want
his little boney-woney?

57:20.341 --> 57:22.536
Little binky-booter!

57:23.101 --> 57:24.853
Hey, squishy bottom!

57:25.661 --> 57:26.935
Hey, lay off him.

57:27.941 --> 57:30.580
Rowlf, come on, let us out of here.

57:30.821 --> 57:34.052
- We wanna go home!
- Yeah, Rowlf, we wanna go home!

57:34.301 --> 57:36.576
Let us out. Let us go home!

57:36.821 --> 57:38.698
Yeah, me too.

57:42.301 --> 57:43.973
"Love, from Rowlf."

57:44.541 --> 57:46.850
They're all doing terrific,
aren't they?

57:47.101 --> 57:49.661
Here's one more.
"Dear Mr. Kermit the Frog:

57:49.901 --> 57:52.699
I would be interested
in talking with you about...

57:52.941 --> 57:55.057
...your musical, Manhattan Melodies.

57:55.301 --> 57:58.099
Come to my office
at your earliest convenience.

57:58.341 --> 58:00.980
Sincerely, Bernard Crawford,
Producer."

58:01.221 --> 58:04.258
I've heard of him.
He's a bigtime Broadway producer!

58:04.501 --> 58:05.490
Really?

58:05.701 --> 58:07.896
Maybe he wants you to sign a contract.

58:08.141 --> 58:09.972
I better get over there right away!

58:10.221 --> 58:13.293
Oh, Kermit! Remember,
just act confident...

58:13.541 --> 58:15.691
...like you know the show is
gonna kill 'em!

58:15.901 --> 58:17.937
Right! Thanks, Jenny.

58:20.461 --> 58:21.860
Goodbye, Piggy.

58:23.741 --> 58:25.857
Call us and tell us what happens.

58:26.101 --> 58:26.897
Hey, watch it!

58:27.101 --> 58:30.457
Sorry, I have to get a contract
so I can go out and kill 'em!

58:41.301 --> 58:42.700
May I help you?

58:42.941 --> 58:45.660
I'm looking for Mr. Crawford.

58:46.101 --> 58:48.661
Are you Kermit the Frog?

58:51.741 --> 58:53.094
I'm Mr. Crawford.

58:53.341 --> 58:54.774
Oh, really?

58:56.901 --> 58:59.461
The office boy is out getting lunch.

58:59.741 --> 59:02.619
You know kids nowadays,
always eating lunch.

59:03.021 --> 59:06.855
- Well, you wanna go in your office...
- No! No, actually...

59:07.261 --> 59:10.298
Why don't we just have a seat
over there for a minute?

59:10.541 --> 59:11.690
Oh, sure.

59:11.941 --> 59:14.250
You're very young to be a producer.

59:14.461 --> 59:15.974
You noticed that, huh?

59:16.221 --> 59:18.655
I started out when I was very...

59:21.821 --> 59:23.300
Can I tell you the truth?

59:23.541 --> 59:27.295
The thing is that I'm not Bernard
Crawford. I'm Ronnie Crawford.

59:27.541 --> 59:30.453
I signed my dad's name.
I didn't think you'd come otherwise.

59:30.661 --> 59:32.970
But I wanna produce your show
on Broadway!

59:33.221 --> 59:35.132
- You do?
- Yeah, I love it!

59:35.341 --> 59:36.490
It is so different!

59:36.741 --> 59:40.700
It's perfect for my first production.
My dad and I have this agreement.

59:40.941 --> 59:43.171
I'm coming up the stairs,
and I want my lunch.

59:43.421 --> 59:44.695
That's my dad.

59:44.941 --> 59:46.056
Ronnie!

59:46.941 --> 59:50.251
- Now.
- Dad, I got great news!

59:50.661 --> 59:52.652
If you two are in love,
I don't wanna hear.

59:52.861 --> 59:56.570
You promised I could have one chance
to become a Broadway producer...

59:56.821 --> 01:00:00.655
...and that you'd get the sets,
lights and scenery and everything.

01:00:00.861 --> 01:00:02.852
I wanna take that chance right now.

01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:06.895
Kermit has written a wonderful musical
called Manhattan Melodies...

01:00:07.141 --> 01:00:09.052
...and I wanna produce it.

01:00:09.341 --> 01:00:12.060
- When do we hear the great news?
- Dad!

01:00:12.301 --> 01:00:14.053
All right, all right.

01:00:14.261 --> 01:00:18.095
Tell me, Mr. Author, what is this
musical? All dancing, all croaking?

01:00:18.341 --> 01:00:21.333
It needs a little work,
because something's still missing.

01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:23.657
The two leads marry,
and there's this song:

01:00:23.861 --> 01:00:25.374
Look at me, here I am...

01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:26.696
Hold it! Hold it!

01:00:26.941 --> 01:00:29.250
I'm allergic to amphibians singing.

01:00:29.621 --> 01:00:32.260
Who's gonna be starring
in this masterpiece?

01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:34.372
It's just me and my friends.

01:00:34.621 --> 01:00:38.011
You know, they're all dogs and bears
and chickens and stuff.

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:40.689
I told you, I wanna do
something different.

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.455
So put some Jell-O down your pants.

01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:47.489
Don't you realize it might be
against the law...

01:00:47.741 --> 01:00:49.936
...having a chicken dancing onstage?

01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:52.892
You're gonna go back on your promise?

01:00:53.141 --> 01:00:56.895
I didn't say anything of the kind.
I'll do everything I said I would.

01:00:57.141 --> 01:01:00.099
Just because this is ridiculous
doesn't mean it won't work.

01:01:00.341 --> 01:01:01.933
All right!

01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:04.411
- When I started in show...
- Thank you, Dad!

01:01:04.821 --> 01:01:06.539
Yeah, thanks, Dad!

01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:08.295
See you later!

01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:10.896
I gotta tell the whole gang!

01:01:16.821 --> 01:01:18.857
- Hello, Pete's.
- Jenny?

01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:20.490
What happened?

01:01:21.101 --> 01:01:24.059
We sold the show!
The producer wants it on Broadway.

01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:25.450
- Really!
- What?

01:01:25.661 --> 01:01:28.778
The producer said he's gonna put
the show on Broadway!

01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:36.492
Tell Piggy she's gonna be a star!

01:01:36.701 --> 01:01:39.932
And, Jenny? I'd like you
to do the costumes.

01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:42.018
Oh! Kermit, thanks!

01:01:43.341 --> 01:01:45.059
Now that we'll be on Broadway...

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:48.054
...remember what you promised
about getting married?

01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:51.900
Not now. We gotta write the gang
and get them back.

01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:55.730
I'll be at Pete's in 10 minutes, okay?
We did it!

01:01:56.741 --> 01:01:57.537
We did it!

01:01:58.901 --> 01:02:00.459
Together again

01:02:33.221 --> 01:02:36.293
Are you sure that Kermit wasn't
at the bus terminal?

01:02:36.581 --> 01:02:39.175
No, is no there. Is better wait.

01:02:39.421 --> 01:02:40.934
Come, sit down.

01:02:41.181 --> 01:02:45.174
He said he'd be here in 10 minutes.
He's never been gone like this.

01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:47.651
Listen. I tell you what is.

01:02:48.821 --> 01:02:50.698
Peoples is peoples.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:53.217
Is frog gone? Yes.

01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:56.460
Is peoples worrying,
is peoples looking...

01:02:56.701 --> 01:02:57.770
...is no come.

01:02:58.021 --> 01:03:01.980
But, is peoples working,
is water boiling...

01:03:02.221 --> 01:03:03.939
...is come. Yeah.

01:03:04.421 --> 01:03:06.571
Peoples is peoples.

01:03:13.421 --> 01:03:15.730
I'm sure Kermit's all right.

01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:20.173
Well, I bet he just got
so excited about the show...

01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:22.332
...he lost track of time.

01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:25.340
No, he's missing. I know it.

01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:29.932
Aren't you excited?

01:03:30.221 --> 01:03:34.578
I mean, just think, you're gonna be
on Broadway in a few months.

01:03:34.821 --> 01:03:35.970
Two weeks.

01:03:36.821 --> 01:03:38.539
The show opens in two weeks.

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.009
Hey, place is closed.

01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:42.530
I'm Ronnie Crawford,
I'm producing Kermit's show.

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:46.371
Well, we're Kermit's friends.

01:03:46.581 --> 01:03:48.219
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm her father.

01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:50.173
The show opens in two weeks?

01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:51.734
Well, my dad said tha...

01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:54.171
I'm letting my dad help out
with the show.

01:03:54.421 --> 01:03:57.777
He said that we could have
the sets, props and costumes...

01:03:57.981 --> 01:04:00.541
...but the show has to open
in two weeks.

01:04:02.621 --> 01:04:05.693
Did you just say Kermit is missing?

01:04:08.701 --> 01:04:11.534
The writer and the star of my show
is missing...

01:04:11.741 --> 01:04:14.209
...and we open in two weeks?

01:04:14.421 --> 01:04:16.173
No sweat. We'll find him.

01:04:16.421 --> 01:04:20.175
We gotta get his friends here,
those bears and chickens and things.

01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:23.060
Could you send telegrams
to Kermit's friends?

01:04:23.301 --> 01:04:24.734
- Oh, please?
- Okey-dokey.

01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:26.494
- Let's go.
- Great! Come on!

01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:28.931
Is no sweat. I write good.

01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:34.138
"Dear bears and chickens and things:

01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:35.536
Is New York.

01:04:35.781 --> 01:04:36.657
Is play!

01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:38.539
Is time!"

01:04:42.981 --> 01:04:44.937
Kermit needs me.

01:04:45.621 --> 01:04:47.179
Beth, Beth! Wake up.

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:50.652
Hey, I'm going to New York City
to be on Broadway!

01:04:50.901 --> 01:04:52.334
I'm up! Is it spring?

01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:54.338
All right! I'm up.

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:57.613
Hey, guys! We're going to New York!

01:04:57.821 --> 01:05:00.335
Hey, girls! We're going to New York!

01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:03.532
We're going to New York!

01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:10.779
New York City! Oh, boy!

01:05:24.741 --> 01:05:26.140
Good morning.

01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:30.578
I see we've had our breakfast,
haven't we?

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:32.974
Hi, doctor.

01:05:33.861 --> 01:05:36.819
How's our amnesia patient
this morning?

01:05:37.621 --> 01:05:41.933
I don't know. I haven't been feeling
like myself lately.

01:05:42.381 --> 01:05:44.133
I tell you what. If I may...

01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:47.532
...I'd like to check your reflexes
once again today.

01:05:47.901 --> 01:05:49.732
Just take a second.

01:05:54.181 --> 01:05:56.934
A little slow and confused.

01:05:57.181 --> 01:06:01.094
But that's to be expected, because,
as you know, you have amnesia.

01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:05.931
I'm gonna check to see that there are
no physical injuries one last time.

01:06:06.301 --> 01:06:07.529
Tickle?

01:06:08.541 --> 01:06:11.578
Now this might hurt
just for a minute.

01:06:11.781 --> 01:06:13.976
But it'll be over soon.

01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:20.340
Adequate musculoskeleton response.

01:06:20.821 --> 01:06:23.938
I want you to take a deep breath.
This will hurt.

01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:33.179
All right.
No rotator-cuff dislocation.

01:06:33.421 --> 01:06:35.537
Now let's try the mandible.

01:06:41.181 --> 01:06:42.330
Peachy.

01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:44.737
No doubt about it.
You have amnesia.

01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:49.736
The problem is, you were found with
no identification, and oddly enough...

01:06:49.981 --> 01:06:51.334
...wearing no clothing.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:55.580
So I did some research into the
major nudist colonies in the area...

01:06:55.821 --> 01:06:58.335
...and I think I've come up
with something.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:03.896
You are Mr. Enrico Tortellini
of Passaic, New Jersey.

01:07:06.741 --> 01:07:09.335
Well, I really don't feel Italian.

01:07:10.941 --> 01:07:12.738
It was just a long shot.

01:07:13.021 --> 01:07:16.457
Mr. X, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but your case is hopeless.

01:07:16.701 --> 01:07:19.169
Why don't you make a new life
for yourself.

01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:23.414
And what we can do for you, is give you
a nice, clean set of clothes...

01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:25.134
...and wish you good luck.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.138
Thank you, doc.

01:07:43.781 --> 01:07:47.410
- So I said, "I don't take
my clothes off for anyone...

01:07:47.621 --> 01:07:49.930
...even if it is 'artistic."'

01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:54.057
Janice, everybody, please!
I'm glad to see you too.

01:07:54.301 --> 01:07:58.340
But I've been trying to tell you that
Kermit is gone. He's disappeared!

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:23.937
Excuse me.

01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:27.575
I'm looking for
the Gordon Employment Agency.

01:08:27.821 --> 01:08:29.015
One floor down.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.496
Oh, I see. Thank you.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.336
Wait a minute.

01:08:36.581 --> 01:08:38.572
Hold it. What's your name?

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.453
"Fill"!

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.131
Phil-up. Philip Phil.

01:08:45.341 --> 01:08:47.138
Philip Phil? Catchy name!

01:08:47.341 --> 01:08:48.979
Phil, I'm Bill and this is Gil.

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.131
Phil, I'm Gil and this is Jill.

01:08:51.341 --> 01:08:53.774
Phil, I'm Jill.
You know Gil and Bill.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.578
Pleased to meet you.

01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:58.573
Step into our office.
We're looking for the opinion...

01:08:58.781 --> 01:09:01.420
...of the common, ordinary
frog on the street.

01:09:01.621 --> 01:09:03.850
You see, Phil, we're in the ad game.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.580
What do you advertise?

01:09:05.821 --> 01:09:07.379
Ocean Breeze Soap.

01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.054
I never heard of that.

01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:10.370
We know.

01:09:10.621 --> 01:09:13.374
The truth is, Phil,
our jobs are on the line.

01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:15.657
- Oh, here, sit down.
- Oh, yes.

01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:19.331
We've been working on a new slogan.
Tell us if you like it.

01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:23.654
"Ocean Breeze Soap.
For people who don't want to stink."

01:09:25.421 --> 01:09:26.456
What do you think?

01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:28.219
Be frank, Phil.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.573
I don't like it.

01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:32.334
You don't?

01:09:33.421 --> 01:09:37.130
How about, "Ocean Breeze Soap.
Just like taking an ocean cruise...

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:40.292
...only there's no boat,
and you don't go anywhere."

01:09:41.621 --> 01:09:43.657
Seems a bit long.

01:09:45.421 --> 01:09:47.537
Have you tried something simple like:

01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:51.336
"Ocean Breeze Soap
will get you clean."

01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:53.136
Wait a minute!

01:09:53.381 --> 01:09:54.575
Wait just a second.

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:56.971
You mean just say
what the product does?

01:09:57.221 --> 01:09:59.337
Why, no one's ever tried that!

01:09:59.581 --> 01:10:00.730
Well, it's crazy.

01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:02.334
Why, it's nuts!

01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:04.771
- We love it!
- Thank you, Phil!

01:10:05.021 --> 01:10:07.854
If we can ever do something
for you, let us know.

01:10:08.101 --> 01:10:10.934
Well, I kind of need a job.

01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:14.733
Phil, you've got one right here.

01:10:14.941 --> 01:10:17.739
We can always use a frog
with horse sense.

01:10:17.941 --> 01:10:19.738
Yes, welcome aboard, Phil.

01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:22.216
You are with us now.

01:10:29.821 --> 01:10:31.937
Waldorf, they finally made it
to Broadway.

01:10:32.141 --> 01:10:34.974
- And I already got tickets.
- Are they good seats?

01:10:35.221 --> 01:10:38.736
They sure are. They're for
the next train out of town!

01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:42.779
So now the show opens
in just one week.

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:45.535
Publicity's started,
and tickets are selling.

01:10:45.781 --> 01:10:48.375
We'll rehearse day and night
to get ready...

01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:50.737
...and we have got to find Kermit!

01:10:50.941 --> 01:10:52.169
Who is this guy?

01:10:52.421 --> 01:10:55.731
He's Ronnie Crawford.
He's producing the show.

01:10:56.021 --> 01:10:56.851
Who's she?

01:10:57.101 --> 01:11:00.252
She's Jenny. She's a friend
of Kermit's and mine.

01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:03.652
What are we standing around here for?
We gotta find Kermit!

01:11:03.901 --> 01:11:05.175
Let's go!

01:11:05.381 --> 01:11:07.292
Go! Go! Go!

01:11:20.501 --> 01:11:21.900
Have you seen a frog?

01:11:24.501 --> 01:11:29.416
- With our revolutionary new slogan:
"Ocean Breeze will get you..."

01:12:14.661 --> 01:12:17.653
- Mr. Mayor! It's an emergency!
- Hold it, everybody!

01:12:17.861 --> 01:12:19.852
I'm looking for
a singing, dancing frog.

01:12:20.061 --> 01:12:23.337
If he can also balance the budget,
I'll hire him.

01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:46.933
Wow. I thought opening night was
supposed to be exciting.

01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:50.335
But not without
our little green buddy.

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:54.257
Maybe we should just cancel.

01:12:54.501 --> 01:12:56.776
No! It is opening night tonight...

01:12:57.021 --> 01:12:59.171
...and the show must go on.

01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:01.889
Kermit would want it that way.

01:13:08.181 --> 01:13:11.378
That was a great presentation
you made this morning, Jill.

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:14.260
- Thanks to Phil's flow chart.
- Thank you, Jill.

01:13:14.501 --> 01:13:17.140
Hey, how about a new place
for lunch today?

01:13:42.581 --> 01:13:44.173
I'll take the bill, Gil.

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:46.935
Oh, good. Something from
the grill, Jill?

01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:50.332
No. Meat makes me ill, Gil.

01:13:53.981 --> 01:13:57.337
We'd better go to the theatre now
and get ready.

01:14:30.581 --> 01:14:33.414
Together again

01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:56.937
Just a couple of frogs.

01:15:01.101 --> 01:15:02.819
No! It's Kermit!

01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:10.659
It's Kermit!

01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:14.937
- It's Kermit!
- How you doing?

01:15:15.501 --> 01:15:17.332
My, what friendly service.

01:15:18.501 --> 01:15:20.776
Where were you?
We were all so worried.

01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:22.170
Where were you?

01:15:22.421 --> 01:15:24.776
I believe there must be some mistake.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:28.696
Phil, since you know the waiters,
why don't you order for us?

01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:30.778
Phil? What does he mean, "Phil"?

01:15:31.021 --> 01:15:33.979
- Kermit, what's wrong?
- Are you speaking to me?

01:15:34.221 --> 01:15:37.372
There's nothing wrong.
And I will have the tuna melt.

01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:39.737
Like, you don't know us?

01:15:40.021 --> 01:15:43.934
- Well, I'm afraid not. Should I?
- What do you mean, "should you"?

01:15:44.141 --> 01:15:48.134
We have a show to put on.
Your show. And it's opening tonight!

01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:51.534
Seeing a show would be a pleasant way
to spend time...

01:15:51.741 --> 01:15:54.175
...but I do have
marketing data to review.

01:15:55.621 --> 01:15:57.532
He really doesn't remember us.

01:15:57.741 --> 01:15:59.777
We have to get him to the theatre.

01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:01.579
This is for your own good.

01:16:01.821 --> 01:16:03.174
Grab him!

01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:07.335
Where are you taking me?!

01:16:08.541 --> 01:16:11.055
They must not get a lot
of repeat business.

01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:31.129
So the grizzly bear
walks out of the room.

01:16:31.341 --> 01:16:34.538
The panda bear thinks to himself,
"This is odd."

01:16:34.741 --> 01:16:38.177
And then the phone rings. You know
who it is? The polar bear.

01:16:38.421 --> 01:16:40.776
And the polar bear says
to the panda bear...

01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:43.376
..."I didn't know it was
a koala bear."

01:16:43.621 --> 01:16:46.579
Get it? Koala! Wocka-wocka!

01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:49.575
This is amusing,
but I have to go now.

01:16:49.821 --> 01:16:50.731
No, wait!

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.175
He doesn't remember.

01:16:52.421 --> 01:16:54.377
It's no use.
We've tried for hours.

01:16:54.621 --> 01:16:57.260
There's nothing left to do.
We have to go on without him.

01:16:57.461 --> 01:17:01.170
Kermit, please! We need you!
Come back to us!

01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:02.177
Look.

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:06.580
Maybe you do know me,
but I really don't remember you.

01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:08.732
I wish I did.

01:17:09.781 --> 01:17:11.533
You'd better take your places.

01:17:22.421 --> 01:17:23.649
Piggy, what'll we do?

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:28.174
Look at me. You are not Phil.

01:17:28.421 --> 01:17:30.252
You are Kermit the Frog.

01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:33.573
That's Gonzo. That's Fozzie.
That's Rowlf and Scooter.

01:17:33.821 --> 01:17:35.777
And they're your friends.

01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:39.138
You wrote the show for them.
That's Ronnie and Jenny.

01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:41.531
And I'm Piggy.
Now listen carefully.

01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:44.380
You are Kermit the Frog...

01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:46.492
...and you love me.

01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:48.379
You want to marry me.

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:51.937
- You want to have children with me.
- With you?

01:17:52.181 --> 01:17:54.331
In love with a pig?

01:17:54.541 --> 01:17:57.339
Oh, wait till I tell
the guys in marketing.

01:17:57.981 --> 01:18:01.132
Maybe you expect me to go hog-wild?

01:18:01.581 --> 01:18:04.539
Maybe, perhaps, you could
bring home the bacon?

01:18:05.501 --> 01:18:07.571
Oh, the sounds of love!

01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:11.972
Cancel the show!

01:18:23.701 --> 01:18:25.339
Where am I, anyway?

01:18:29.221 --> 01:18:30.939
Are you all right?

01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:33.336
- What's going on?
- You're going on!

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.736
It's Broadway. You made it!

01:18:36.981 --> 01:18:40.860
No, the script isn't ready.
There's still something missing.

01:18:41.101 --> 01:18:44.650
- No, it's terrific.
- We gotta tell everyone Kermit's okay.

01:18:44.941 --> 01:18:46.897
Do you remember the opening number?

01:18:48.221 --> 01:18:49.336
You mean...

01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:52.733
Look at me

01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:55.139
Here I am

01:18:56.621 --> 01:18:58.691
Right where I belong

01:19:00.821 --> 01:19:03.619
I see that face comin' back to me

01:19:04.021 --> 01:19:06.933
Like an old familiar song

01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:10.893
What better place could anyone be?

01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:13.977
'Cause you're here with me

01:19:14.581 --> 01:19:17.334
It's all I've been lookin' for
And so much more

01:19:17.581 --> 01:19:19.936
And now I'm here
Now you're here

01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:22.172
Nothing can go wrong 'cause I am

01:19:22.421 --> 01:19:25.538
Right where I belong

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:27.934
Here we go!

01:19:28.141 --> 01:19:31.736
Hi, guys! Could our friends watch
the show from backstage?

01:19:31.981 --> 01:19:33.539
Could they? Could they?

01:19:34.221 --> 01:19:35.779
Wait a minute! No!

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:38.330
They cannot watch
the show from backstage.

01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:42.131
That's it! That's what's missing.
That's what we need!

01:19:42.341 --> 01:19:45.458
More frogs and dogs and bears
and chickens and whatever!

01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:48.129
You won't watch the show,
you'll be in it!

01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:49.336
Come on!

01:19:59.741 --> 01:20:01.732
Look at us, here we are

01:20:01.981 --> 01:20:03.733
Right where we belong

01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:05.932
The curtain's up
And the light's are bright

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:08.900
And they're playing our old song

01:20:09.101 --> 01:20:11.535
What better place could anyone be?

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:14.218
'Cause you're here with me

01:20:14.501 --> 01:20:17.538
So everyone, here we go
Let's start the show

01:20:33.301 --> 01:20:36.771
Extra! Extra!
Somebody's getting married!

01:20:37.021 --> 01:20:38.534
Somebody's getting married?

01:20:38.741 --> 01:20:40.413
Hey, somebody's getting married!

01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:43.541
Whoa! Somebody's getting married!

01:20:43.821 --> 01:20:45.379
Somebody's getting married?

01:20:47.621 --> 01:20:50.579
Somebody's getting married

01:20:51.501 --> 01:20:54.174
Somebody's getting married

01:21:05.901 --> 01:21:09.450
Somebody get some flowers
Somebody get a ring

01:21:09.701 --> 01:21:13.330
Somebody get a chapel
And a choir to sing

01:21:13.581 --> 01:21:17.096
Somebody get an organ to play

01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:21.175
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today

01:21:25.101 --> 01:21:28.730
Somebody get a preacher
Somebody bake a cake

01:21:28.941 --> 01:21:32.456
Somebody get some shoes and rice
And presents to take

01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:36.330
Somebody get a sweet negligee

01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:40.375
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today

01:21:40.621 --> 01:21:44.170
Wedding, wedding
Pig and Froggy wedding

01:21:44.381 --> 01:21:47.976
Somebody get champagne
Somebody rent a room

01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:51.810
Somebody get the lovely bride
And somebody get the...

01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:53.500
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody

01:21:54.021 --> 01:21:57.377
Somebody get this wedding under way

01:21:57.621 --> 01:22:01.296
'Cause somebody's
Getting married today

01:22:17.181 --> 01:22:20.537
Somebody's getting married...

01:22:20.741 --> 01:22:22.777
...today

01:22:32.421 --> 01:22:34.139
Are they here yet?
Are they here yet?

01:22:34.381 --> 01:22:35.973
Did I miss it? Am I late?

01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:37.973
No, they'll be here any minute

01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:40.177
Oh, boy, me can hardly wait

01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:43.977
Isn't this ex citing?
It's the wedding of the year

01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:45.734
Look, can't we start without them?

01:22:45.941 --> 01:22:48.535
No, you can't until they're here

01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:53.213
They're finally getting married...

01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:56.293
...now

01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:18.853
He'll make me happy

01:23:19.101 --> 01:23:21.740
Each time I see him

01:23:21.981 --> 01:23:24.654
He'll be the reason

01:23:24.901 --> 01:23:27.654
My heart can sing

01:23:27.901 --> 01:23:30.734
He'll stand beside me

01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:33.774
And I'll have everything

01:23:34.021 --> 01:23:36.933
She'll make me happy

01:23:37.181 --> 01:23:39.979
Each time I hold her

01:23:40.221 --> 01:23:42.576
And I will follow

01:23:42.781 --> 01:23:45.579
Where my heart may lead

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:50.897
And she'll be all I ever need

01:23:53.421 --> 01:23:57.494
Days go passing into years

01:23:59.421 --> 01:24:04.211
Years go passing day by day

01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:07.254
She'll make him happy

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:10.459
Now and forever

01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:13.334
Until forever

01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.930
Their love will grow

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:19.179
She only knows

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:22.174
He'll make her happy

01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:27.336
That's all she needs to know

01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:31.260
They'll be so happy

01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:34.174
Now and forever

01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:39.336
Until forever, their love will grow

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:43.139
I only know

01:24:43.381 --> 01:24:46.691
He'll make me happy

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:50.132
That's all I need...

01:24:50.341 --> 01:24:54.732
...to know

01:25:03.941 --> 01:25:07.217
Piggy, I thought Gonzo was
gonna play the minister.

01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:18.936
Do you, Piggy, take this frog to be
Your lawful wedded husband?

01:25:19.221 --> 01:25:20.939
Do you?

01:25:24.421 --> 01:25:28.414
I do

01:25:33.621 --> 01:25:37.580
Do you, Froggy, take this pig
To be your lawful wedded wife...

01:25:37.821 --> 01:25:39.140
...until you die?

01:25:42.021 --> 01:25:44.694
Well, I...

01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:50.093
Well, I...

01:25:50.301 --> 01:25:51.734
Do you?

01:26:02.221 --> 01:26:05.611
I do

01:26:08.861 --> 01:26:13.776
Then because you share a love so big

01:26:14.221 --> 01:26:16.735
I now pronounce you...

01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:21.139
...frog and pig

01:26:33.181 --> 01:26:35.058
They got married!

01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:44.976
What better way could anything end?

01:26:45.181 --> 01:26:47.649
Hand in hand with a friend

01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:30.210
