to get better.

04:15.496 --> 04:17.533
It's gonna be fine.

04:19.362 --> 04:21.053
I promise.

04:23.953 --> 04:26.990
And I don't blame you.
I need you to know that.

04:28.544 --> 04:31.167
But try, please.

05:19.008 --> 05:21.182
City sounds.

05:21.217 --> 05:24.703
The ebb and flow of humanity.

05:24.738 --> 05:28.224
Now, for the benefit
of our new friend, Jacob,

05:28.258 --> 05:31.020
let's all introduce ourselves.

05:31.054 --> 05:32.573
I'll start.

05:32.608 --> 05:34.472
Welcome, Jacob.

05:34.506 --> 05:36.405
I'm Dr. Angeli.

05:36.439 --> 05:38.234
I'm a psychologist.

05:38.268 --> 05:40.512
Now, this city soundtrack

05:40.547 --> 05:42.894
is how I like
to start our session,

05:42.928 --> 05:45.379
with something
that takes us back

05:45.414 --> 05:50.764
to life outside the clinic,
where you all belong.

05:51.765 --> 05:55.113
Now, Rufus,
would you like to continue?

Yes.

06:03.984 --> 06:05.917
Uh, I'm a boy.

06:05.951 --> 06:08.506
I used to believe
I was a German shepherd,

06:08.540 --> 06:11.543
and my favorite food
is corned beef.

Jeremy.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.548
Hi.

06:50.582 --> 06:54.621
I'm Jeremy,
and I am not a squirrel.

06:54.655 --> 06:57.037
No, you're not.

Good.

DR.Have you been
doing your diary entries?

07:13.329 --> 07:16.332
Everyone, these are
really important.

07:16.366 --> 07:19.093
They're a big part
of distancing yourself

07:19.128 --> 07:21.475
-from your projection.
-I'm doing 'em.

07:21.510 --> 07:24.789
DR.And you've made
some fantastic progress, Rufus.

You know we're family?

09:53.662 --> 09:56.078
I could see it straight off.
First glance, boom.

-Family?
-Sure.

09:58.494 --> 10:00.116

We're the same, you and I.
We're pack animals.

-I'm not sure.
-We are.

10:04.845 --> 10:06.813
[stammers] I've known a wolf.

10:06.847 --> 10:08.262
I-I've known a couple wolves.

10:08.297 --> 10:10.851
Um, they're
really popular online.

10:10.886 --> 10:12.508
I chose to be a German shepherd

10:12.542 --> 10:14.648
'cause of
my German shepherd, Sparks.

10:14.683 --> 10:15.787
I have my own pack, you know.

10:15.822 --> 10:17.306
Well, no, it-it wasn't-- I-I--

10:17.340 --> 10:18.859
it wasn't my pack,
but I was a part of one.

10:18.894 --> 10:21.310
And my mum got worried
and sent me here.

10:21.344 --> 10:22.691
-She doesn't like systems.
-[quacking aggressively]

10:22.725 --> 10:24.175

-Right.

10:27.385 --> 10:28.489
Uh, he's an Almost Out.

10:28.524 --> 10:30.353
That's the next stage.

10:30.388 --> 10:32.390
You get there
with good behavior.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.943
They're gonna leave soon.

10:33.978 --> 10:36.290
-Uh, d-don't! Uh, sorry.
-[Almost Out laughs]

10:36.325 --> 10:38.638

10:38.672 --> 10:40.536
-What cases?
-[aggressive quacking]

10:40.570 --> 10:41.882
Well, the Almost Out
is showing him

10:41.917 --> 10:43.297
-the error of his ways.
-[Ivan grunting]

If you want to get better,
you have to follow the rules.

Why would you do that? Huh?

You've been doing so well.

Go take a seat.
I'll get you a plate.

Sorry, Louise, not today.

13:32.570 --> 13:34.606

13:40.681 --> 13:42.822
You need to have
some real food, too.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.651
Then you get your seeds.

13:44.685 --> 13:46.860
Then you get your seeds.

13:46.895 --> 13:48.517
DR.
No seeds, then.

13:52.728 --> 13:53.936
That's it.

That will be the highlight
of your week.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.605
Why do they want us
to use these things?

15:17.709 --> 15:20.816
Technology reconnects us
with our human side.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.682
Or some other bullshit.

his plastic theories.

15:57.853 --> 16:00.131
We call him the Zookeeper.

Keep clear of him.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.273
Dr. Angeli's better.

Come on.

Not like a boy.

Don't you know
how squirrels climb?

You should since you are one.

18:05.808 --> 18:07.327
No, no, no.

18:07.362 --> 18:09.157
Squirrels go vertically.

18:09.191 --> 18:13.264
They use their pads and
their claws to go up, up, up.

18:13.299 --> 18:15.922
So come on, use those pads,
those claws.

19:14.498 --> 19:16.465
All right. We'll get you there.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.742
It's trial and error.

19:17.777 --> 19:19.158
Help him out.

19:20.573 --> 19:22.161
You're all tangled up.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.232
He's got a bit of a...

19:24.266 --> 19:26.337
bit of a scratch on his finger.

19:28.581 --> 19:30.893
Anja will take care of you.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.556
Jacob.

19:40.593 --> 19:42.629
Jacob the wolf.

19:47.116 --> 19:49.049
If you're a wolf...

19:50.154 --> 19:52.536
...get down on all fours.

19:52.570 --> 19:54.193
Come on.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.574
[Jacobs grunts, pants]

19:56.609 --> 19:58.266
That's it.

19:58.300 --> 20:01.200
Now, if you're a wolf, howl.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.927
Attack me if you're a wolf.

20:06.584 --> 20:08.966
You've attacked people before,
haven't you?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.761
Your parents told me
what happened.

20:10.795 --> 20:12.245
I don't want to be a wolf.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.282
Don't lie to me.

20:14.316 --> 20:16.594
I've known boys
who thought they were wolves

20:16.629 --> 20:18.734
and died because of it.

20:21.185 --> 20:22.773
Now, howl.

20:24.602 --> 20:26.639
-Please.
-Howl!

20:31.816 --> 20:33.853
[Jacob's breath trembling]

20:43.518 --> 20:45.244
Good boy.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.421
Did you see that?

20:50.456 --> 20:52.354
He resisted.

that with these hands,

22:13.780 --> 22:15.713
that, uh...

22:15.748 --> 22:18.198
this is a boy.

22:18.233 --> 22:20.028
Is that right?

22:27.035 --> 22:28.933
You say you don't want
to be a wolf.

22:28.968 --> 22:31.246
Isn't that right, Jacob?

22:31.280 --> 22:33.490
Jacob, isn't that right?

22:33.524 --> 22:35.423
You don't want to be a wolf?

as a wolf.

Right, so you're saying
that if, uh,

Yes?

your animal for the next week.

that I do everything it takes

healthy and rewarding life.

Yes, I can see that.

No, I think she's too fragile.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.415
with no empathy
for those who are different.

36:50.449 --> 36:52.279
That's it. In you go.

36:52.313 --> 36:54.281
[footsteps receding]

37:42.052 --> 37:43.882
[Jacob grunts softly]

38:13.877 --> 38:15.914
[leaves and weeds
rustling in wind]

38:28.582 --> 38:31.032
I've been here
since I was little.

38:34.484 --> 38:37.556
And Dr. Angeli's been
like a mother to me.

38:40.179 --> 38:42.216
This place is all I've known.

38:47.394 --> 38:51.536
The only thing I remember
from before was this water.

38:53.192 --> 38:55.919
And there was a crack
in the ceiling, and...

38:57.887 --> 39:01.960
...there was this water that
just never stopped dripping.

39:06.516 --> 39:10.037
I would hear it, and I would...

39:11.970 --> 39:14.041
...count the drops all night.

39:17.562 --> 39:19.978
And that's the first thing
I remember.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.572
And I wish I didn't.

39:32.922 --> 39:34.786
What about you?

39:43.726 --> 39:46.798
I've always had this feeling.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.733
These instincts.

39:54.495 --> 39:58.430
Everything I was learning
as a child just...

39:58.465 --> 40:00.328
felt wrong.

40:02.641 --> 40:04.367
Didn't fit.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.857
I can't explain it.

40:17.587 --> 40:19.313
[quietly]:
Go on.

40:31.498 --> 40:34.190
We were walking
through the nature park...

40:36.157 --> 40:38.194
...when I heard a sound.

40:41.887 --> 40:43.855
I can still feel it.

40:46.513 --> 40:48.653
It felt like
it was meant for me.

40:52.898 --> 40:55.073
I wanted to run towards it.

40:56.695 --> 40:58.456
And I tried.

40:59.836 --> 41:02.874
I tugged away from my father,
and I ran towards it.

41:06.325 --> 41:08.811
I felt...

41:08.845 --> 41:10.882
such lightness.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.369
Every breath.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.653
He pulled me back.

41:25.379 --> 41:27.450
Took me up in his arms.

41:29.452 --> 41:31.868
And he was speaking to me,

41:31.903 --> 41:33.939
but I couldn't hear him.

41:36.597 --> 41:39.082
All I could hear was this howl.

41:43.915 --> 41:46.434
And then I looked into his eyes.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.924
And I remembered I was his son.

42:18.639 --> 42:21.055
What is it about the forest?

42:34.621 --> 42:36.450
The smells.

42:40.488 --> 42:42.145
The ground.

42:44.527 --> 42:46.184
Damp.

42:47.185 --> 42:48.842
Cold.

42:49.808 --> 42:51.845
[wind howling]

42:53.812 --> 42:55.607
This skin.

42:56.988 --> 42:59.922
These arms, this hair.

43:03.477 --> 43:06.273
I have no human form.

43:11.312 --> 43:12.969
I'm running.

43:15.938 --> 43:17.698
Breathing.

43:20.218 --> 43:22.841
[Judith screaming]

43:22.876 --> 43:24.843
No! No!

43:24.878 --> 43:26.327
No!

43:26.362 --> 43:29.123
-That's it, go. Fly.
-No, no. No, please.

43:29.158 --> 43:31.781
-Yes. Jump.
-No. No!

43:31.816 --> 43:34.128
-Come on, jump.
-No. No, no.

43:34.163 --> 43:36.130
Are you, or are you not
a parrot?

43:36.165 --> 43:37.476
I am.

43:37.511 --> 43:39.271
-You are? Then fly.
-No!

43:39.306 --> 43:41.653
No. [whimpering]

43:41.688 --> 43:44.104
-If you're a parrot, then fly.
-No. No.

43:44.138 --> 43:45.830
No, no, no, no. No, no!

43:45.864 --> 43:47.176
-DR.Come on!
-No, no!

43:47.210 --> 43:48.798
No, no, no, no! I'm a girl!

43:48.833 --> 43:50.697
I'm a girl, I'm a girl,
I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

43:50.731 --> 43:52.560
[panting]

43:52.595 --> 43:54.321
DR.
What are you?

43:55.494 --> 43:57.462
I'm a... I'm a girl.

43:57.496 --> 43:58.843
Good.

43:58.877 --> 44:00.568
Very good.

44:00.603 --> 44:02.640
[Judith whimpering softly]

44:05.056 --> 44:06.713
DR.
This is freedom.

44:06.747 --> 44:09.854
The will to be responsible
to ourselves.

44:11.821 --> 44:15.169
When you're old,
you'll remember me

44:15.204 --> 44:18.276
as the man who taught you
to walk for the second time.

44:20.727 --> 44:22.452
Take her down.

44:37.295 --> 44:39.262
Go on, through to lunch.

46:06.867 --> 46:08.938

Stop.

-[wind and rain thundering]

49:37.319 --> 49:39.355
[wind howling outside]

49:42.082 --> 49:44.774
DR.
You know what a howl is?

49:47.329 --> 49:49.365
It's you...

49:49.400 --> 49:51.678
wanting to be heard.

49:54.681 --> 49:57.718
There's something
you want to say,

49:57.753 --> 50:00.031
something...

50:00.066 --> 50:03.448
you want to scream out
to the world.

50:09.558 --> 50:12.423
Your, uh... your parents.

50:13.769 --> 50:15.460
Your father.

50:17.083 --> 50:20.879
What kind of relationship
did you have with him?

50:27.576 --> 50:29.578
[teeth chattering]

50:30.786 --> 50:32.822
What's your earliest memory?

50:34.065 --> 50:35.722
Jacob?

50:49.460 --> 50:52.187
DR.
Oh, let's see happiness.

50:52.221 --> 50:54.085
Good. Happiness.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.122
I'm seeing that happiness
radiate from your face.

50:56.156 --> 50:57.537
That's it.

50:57.571 --> 50:59.470
See what that does to you, Ivan?

50:59.504 --> 51:01.644
How does it brighten up
your face?

51:01.679 --> 51:03.715
-Can you show me? Look at that.
-[Ivan quacking]

51:03.750 --> 51:06.063
Good. And that's how
happiness begins.

51:06.097 --> 51:08.720
But happiness becomes laughter.

51:08.755 --> 51:11.723
[Dr. Angeli laughing heartily]

51:11.758 --> 51:15.658
Like it's the best joke
you've ever heard.

51:15.693 --> 51:18.109
Yes, Ola, that's it.

51:18.144 --> 51:20.007
[laughing]:
Show me that bright smile

51:20.042 --> 51:21.768
coming from deep inside.

51:21.802 --> 51:24.460
[Dr. Angeli continues laughing]

51:24.495 --> 51:26.738
You got to let
that laughter out.

51:26.773 --> 51:29.327
And sometimes
it tightens up your face.

51:29.362 --> 51:32.503
Let's have hysterical laughter.

51:32.537 --> 51:34.160
Yes, Ivan.

51:34.194 --> 51:36.265
[laughing hysterically]

51:38.716 --> 51:40.959
Hysterical laughter
will also come out of here.

51:40.994 --> 51:42.478
See if you can find that.

51:42.513 --> 51:44.308
Let's hear it. [whoops, laughs]

51:44.342 --> 51:45.999
[chuckling]:
We're laugh... we're laughing.

51:46.033 --> 51:47.863
-DR.That's it.
-We're laughing.

51:47.897 --> 51:51.038
DR.Let me hear
what a giggle sounds like.

51:51.073 --> 51:53.179
[giggling]: A giggle is very
different to everything else.

51:53.213 --> 51:56.043
A giggle isn't a laugh
quite yet.

51:56.078 --> 51:59.840
It's a giggle, and it's
bubbling up all small inside.

51:59.875 --> 52:01.773
That's it. That's good.

52:01.808 --> 52:04.086
Yes, Louise.

52:05.087 --> 52:06.537
Yes, Ivan, good.

52:08.677 --> 52:11.473
[fading]:
Yes, yes, yes.

52:20.206 --> 52:21.655
I fancy... [grunts]

52:21.690 --> 52:23.174
some duck for dinner, eh?

Get off me. Get off me.

52:31.838 --> 52:34.461
Yes, I'll-I'll leave him alone.

-Please, please, please!
-[snarling viciously]

-[whistle blowing]
-DR.Jacob!

52:49.027 --> 52:50.546
Jacob, get off!

52:50.581 --> 52:51.858
Get off!

52:51.892 --> 52:53.549
-Come with me.
-Freak!

52:53.584 --> 52:55.275
Get off. Come with me.

52:57.381 --> 52:59.072
We'll get it sorted.

53:00.038 --> 53:01.868
Mm-hmm.

53:01.902 --> 53:03.835
Okay, yeah.

53:03.870 --> 53:05.906
All right. I'll see you then.

53:06.942 --> 53:08.426
Okay.

53:08.461 --> 53:10.532
Chat soon. All right, bye-bye.

53:15.088 --> 53:17.539
[sighing]

53:18.954 --> 53:20.714
Jacob.

53:22.129 --> 53:24.580
I'm Dr. Sullivan,
the general manager.

53:27.549 --> 53:29.999
And, Jacob,
this is your only warning.

53:33.589 --> 53:36.558
Violence will not be tolerated
in this institution.

53:43.289 --> 53:45.325
Your parents have been informed.

53:48.155 --> 53:49.743
Another episode like this,

53:49.778 --> 53:51.987
and you'll face
serious consequences.

53:55.508 --> 53:57.820
You don't want
to go down this path.

54:01.617 --> 54:04.033
I hope this is
sinking in, Jacob.

54:06.173 --> 54:08.279
For your own sake.

54:08.314 --> 54:10.764
You won't get anywhere
by fighting us.

54:10.799 --> 54:12.007
Okay.

54:12.041 --> 54:14.009
Rufus, you ready?

54:14.043 --> 54:15.838
[Rufus clears throat]

54:15.873 --> 54:18.634
Okay, so, uh, as you all know,

54:18.669 --> 54:21.672
I've been doing
incredibly well recently.

54:21.706 --> 54:23.467
Exhibit A.

54:23.501 --> 54:27.229
And, uh, as a result,
Mum is taking me out.

54:28.541 --> 54:31.958
I know. She says I've been here
long enough and that...

54:31.992 --> 54:34.788
you know, she wants to give me
a chance on the outside, so...

54:34.823 --> 54:37.308
Everyone's thinking, what's
Jacob gonna do without me?

54:37.343 --> 54:39.345
He's getting emotional,
but yeah.

54:39.379 --> 54:41.450
And look, I'm sad, too,
uh, that I'm missing

54:41.485 --> 54:43.694
the Almost Out graduation
tomorrow.

54:43.728 --> 54:45.972
And that I won't be able
to graduate with you guys

54:46.006 --> 54:47.594
when the time comes.

54:47.629 --> 54:49.596
But Mum knows best.

54:49.631 --> 54:51.874
But anyway, we're gonna go
on holiday together.

54:51.909 --> 54:55.602
And, um, I'm gonna be
on my best human behavior.

54:55.637 --> 54:58.156
But I want to leave you
with one message.

54:58.191 --> 54:59.882
-And that's-- my success...
-Rufus.

54:59.917 --> 55:01.850
Your mother's not
taking you on holiday.

55:01.884 --> 55:03.541
-She is...
-Your mother is collecting you,

55:03.576 --> 55:05.025
but she's not taking you
on holiday.

55:05.060 --> 55:06.889
We're going on
a-a sort of holiday,

55:06.924 --> 55:10.030
but-but what I wanted to say is
it's kind of a holiday.

55:10.065 --> 55:12.239
It's a home holiday.

55:12.274 --> 55:16.382
Anyway,
my success is your success.

55:16.416 --> 55:18.038
The moment was slightly...

55:18.073 --> 55:20.109
Anyway, my success
is your success.

DR.Now, as is tradition
when our patients graduate,

55:38.887 --> 55:43.063
we like to honor their hard work
with a little ceremony.

55:43.098 --> 55:47.551
So, please, come to the front,
Robert Ward.

55:47.585 --> 55:49.622
Well done, Robert.

55:53.211 --> 55:56.007
Hold it up, Robert,
so the parents can see.

55:56.042 --> 56:00.391
Now, your goodbye consists
with the final severance

56:00.426 --> 56:02.428
from your animal.

56:07.156 --> 56:08.710
When you're ready, Robert.

That's it.

Well done, Nora.

57:21.852 --> 57:23.681
-How dare you come in here.
-It's not fair.

57:23.716 --> 57:25.580
-Dr. Mann will hear about this.
-What happened?

57:25.614 --> 57:27.513
-[sobbing]
-What did you do?

57:27.547 --> 57:29.687
You know nothing about her.

57:29.722 --> 57:31.378
Get out.

Those kids...

57:42.424 --> 57:44.322
they're going back
to their parents.

57:44.357 --> 57:46.221
You really want
to go back to yours?

57:46.255 --> 57:48.326
Do you? Do you want to leave?

57:48.361 --> 57:50.777
Don't say that!
Do you want to get rid of me?

57:50.812 --> 57:53.055
DR.Ugh.
You're being self-centered.

57:53.090 --> 57:54.781
[sighs] Come here.

58:55.428 --> 58:57.464
Is this how you see yourself?

59:00.226 --> 59:02.090
Lie down.

59:07.958 --> 59:09.960
Is this you?

59:09.994 --> 59:13.688
This pathetic,
flea-ridden beast?

59:13.722 --> 59:15.482
Answer me.

59:16.518 --> 59:18.313
No.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.142
But it's a wolf.

59:22.110 --> 59:24.491
One that has been trapped by man

59:24.526 --> 59:27.149
and will be killed by man.

59:27.184 --> 59:30.083
That's why we are
the superior race.

59:32.016 --> 59:34.467
Is that what you think a man is?

59:34.501 --> 59:36.296
Yes, I do.

59:48.826 --> 59:50.794
[Jacob moans gently]

59:59.699 --> 1:00:01.598
[Dr. Mann sighs]

1:00:03.669 --> 1:00:05.636
Be careful, Jacob.

1:00:05.671 --> 1:00:09.398
When you gaze into the abyss,
the abyss gazes back into you.

1:00:16.889 --> 1:00:18.511
Come on.

1:00:18.545 --> 1:00:20.099
Let's go.

1:00:20.133 --> 1:00:22.170
[breathing heavily]

1:00:24.172 --> 1:00:26.450
Move!

[Jacob sniffing]

1:01:30.756 --> 1:01:32.619
DR. MANN [recorded]:
I'm not a wolf.

1:01:32.654 --> 1:01:35.346
Just a violent boy.

1:01:35.381 --> 1:01:39.454
I am not a wolf.

1:01:39.488 --> 1:01:43.734
Just a very sick boy.

1:02:34.923 --> 1:02:36.718
[whispers]:
Jacob.

1:03:01.950 --> 1:03:05.057
I was in here, too,
when I first arrived.

1:03:08.543 --> 1:03:10.579
I'd used my claws...

1:03:12.167 --> 1:03:14.204
...to scratch my stepdad.

1:03:19.209 --> 1:03:21.176
I tried to hurt him.

1:03:23.351 --> 1:03:25.698
But he was always
stronger than me.

1:03:32.774 --> 1:03:35.397
I would count the drops

1:03:35.432 --> 1:03:38.538
from the broken drain
as they hit the floor.

1:03:41.024 --> 1:03:43.060
Knowing that he was coming.

1:03:45.614 --> 1:03:48.755
I would close my eyes tight...

1:03:48.790 --> 1:03:50.827
and imagine...

1:03:52.173 --> 1:03:55.417
...that I could jump
out the window

1:03:55.452 --> 1:03:58.455
and fall to the ground
unscathed.

1:04:03.046 --> 1:04:05.082
That I could run.

1:04:06.532 --> 1:04:10.812
Run faster than anyone
could ever catch me.

1:04:36.424 --> 1:04:38.460
The smells.

1:04:39.772 --> 1:04:41.636
The ground.

1:04:43.051 --> 1:04:45.260
Damp.

1:04:45.295 --> 1:04:47.090
Cold.

1:04:49.575 --> 1:04:53.165
The trees blurring.

1:04:55.132 --> 1:04:57.100
I'm running.

1:04:58.101 --> 1:05:00.068
Breathing.

1:05:03.347 --> 1:05:06.247
I have no human form.

1:05:15.428 --> 1:05:18.086
One day...

1:05:18.121 --> 1:05:20.502
we'll run wild together.

1:05:44.285 --> 1:05:46.321
[breathing deeply]

1:06:04.891 --> 1:06:06.928

[insects trilling]

1:07:20.967 --> 1:07:24.557
Would you like to know more
about your fellow inmate?

1:07:29.390 --> 1:07:32.082
He was in a plane crash
years ago.

1:07:33.290 --> 1:07:35.258
He was stranded in the desert

1:07:35.292 --> 1:07:37.846
with no food, no water.

1:07:39.917 --> 1:07:43.231
He and a handful
of other survivors,

1:07:43.266 --> 1:07:46.821
they were forced to eat
another passenger who'd died.

1:07:48.271 --> 1:07:50.480
When they were rescued,

1:07:50.514 --> 1:07:52.930
he was in a state of shock.

1:07:52.965 --> 1:07:54.863
He could only roar.

1:07:56.279 --> 1:07:58.902
He started to behave
like a lion.

1:07:58.936 --> 1:08:01.077
He lived outdoors,

1:08:01.111 --> 1:08:03.217
roaring,

1:08:03.251 --> 1:08:06.082
terrorizing the people
of the neighboring villages.

1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:11.811
Till his wife went out
to find him and...

1:08:11.846 --> 1:08:14.814
and she had him committed here
indefinitely.

1:08:14.849 --> 1:08:16.161
[moans softly]

1:08:16.195 --> 1:08:18.784
He was already past saving.

[man continues moaning softly]

1:08:26.688 --> 1:08:30.071
I'm going to let you go back
to your room tonight.

1:08:32.798 --> 1:08:35.594
But now you can see, Jacob,

1:08:35.628 --> 1:08:38.562
there is always
a point of no return.

DR. MANN [over video]:
As humans, we have awareness

1:09:01.516 --> 1:09:03.863
of our own mental processes:

1:09:03.898 --> 1:09:08.144
our thoughts,
our feelings, our sensations.

1:09:08.178 --> 1:09:10.146
We are the only beings
on the planet

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:12.182
that have this type
of self-awareness,

1:09:12.217 --> 1:09:14.184
which is called consciousness.

1:09:14.219 --> 1:09:18.015
Because of this,
we are superior to animals,

1:09:18.050 --> 1:09:20.984
who rely only
on their instincts.

1:09:21.018 --> 1:09:24.367
Our ability to be introspective
and to look forward

1:09:24.401 --> 1:09:27.197
is why we have succeeded
both in surviving

1:09:27.232 --> 1:09:29.406

1:33:25.151 --> 1:33:26.255
We'll be ourselves.

1:33:26.290 --> 1:33:28.050
But I'm not a wildcat.

1:33:30.052 --> 1:33:32.054
I'm sorry. I'm not.

1:33:33.504 --> 1:33:36.334
Doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

1:33:36.369 --> 1:33:37.957
Please stay.

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.037
[alarm blaring in distance]

1:33:49.071 --> 1:33:51.453
-I... I can't.
-No.

1:33:51.487 --> 1:33:53.766
-I can't stay here with you.
-No, please stay here with me.

1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:55.768
-I have to go. Now.
-No, no, no, no, no!

1:33:55.802 --> 1:33:57.839
No! Please don't go.

1:33:59.323 --> 1:34:00.738
Jacob.

1:34:08.366 --> 1:34:10.058
[groans]

1:34:18.825 --> 1:34:20.689
Jacob!

1:34:23.588 --> 1:34:25.176
Stay!

1:34:36.015 --> 1:34:39.052
[howling]

1:34:42.642 --> 1:34:44.679
[whistle blowing in distance]

1:34:49.614 --> 1:34:52.652
[howling]

1:37:19.523 --> 1:37:21.387
- The night

1:37:25.874 --> 1:37:28.049
- In which you vanished

1:37:29.913 --> 1:37:31.880
- Like a shiver

1:37:38.542 --> 1:37:40.544
- You're prey to die

1:37:42.442 --> 1:37:44.030
- You and me

1:37:45.929 --> 1:37:48.517
- You and me

1:37:53.798 --> 1:37:55.697
- Like the wind

1:37:55.731 --> 1:37:57.906
- My strangled meow

1:37:59.943 --> 1:38:01.910
- Cruel symphony

1:38:08.468 --> 1:38:10.229
- In which you vanished

1:38:10.263 --> 1:38:11.920
- Cruel symphony

1:38:14.992 --> 1:38:16.545
- Cruel symphony

1:39:41.527 --> 1:39:43.529
[song ends]
