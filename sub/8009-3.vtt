- So, I'm supposed to go

00:11.999 --> 00:13.999
out to lunch with Scott, and I
just wanted to make sure that I

00:13.999 --> 00:15.999
had your blessing before I just
go have lunch with him.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.999
Sure. He can come
over.

00:17.999 --> 00:21.000
The whole thing was an
open door policy.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.999
That has changed.
His main concern is himself.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
He flaked on the kids' first day
of school.

00:26.999 --> 00:29.999
You, like, partied through the
next day, just like a real

00:37.999 --> 00:40.999
can all hang out together, do
things with the kids as a

00:40.999 --> 00:45.999
family, but he's not in that
place right now.

00:45.999 --> 00:48.999
Um, would it be okay if
he went by and put Mason to bed

00:48.999 --> 00:51.999
- tonight and P?
- Sure, if he was

00:51.999 --> 00:54.999
there when they get home to have
dinner at 5:30, sit and have

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
- dinner with them...
- Anything else, boss?

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
You want me to fold any of your
clothes or anything?

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
Can you not commit
to going for, like, two and a

01:01.999 --> 01:04.999
- half hours?
- Kourtney, we're gonna

01:04.999 --> 01:07.999
hang up now, but he'll be over
there about 5:30.

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999
- Love you, too. Bye.
- Are you gonna go put

- Mason to bed tonight?
- I don't know.

01:13.999 --> 01:16.999
- This whole  is so weird.
- This doesn't matter.

01:16.999 --> 01:18.999
- I'm going to Florida.
- You're going to

01:18.999 --> 01:19.999
- Florida?
- Yeah.

01:19.999 --> 01:21.999
- When?
- In a couple hours.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.000
Come on.
If that was my window to spend

01:24.000 --> 01:26.999
with my kids, I'd go enjoy my
window.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.999
It's like, "All right,
sit with your kid, eat dinner

01:29.999 --> 01:31.999
with your kid, put your kid to
sleep, and then get out."

01:31.999 --> 01:33.999
Listen, but it's part
of the price that you're gonna

01:33.999 --> 01:37.999
have to  pay for this
whole thing.

01:37.999 --> 01:41.999
You have to earn back trust that
you've lost.

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
I don't know. It's
just... it's just not as easy as

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
- it sounds.
- No, it's not gonna be

01:45.999 --> 01:48.999
easy, but you have to fight for
what you want.

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
You don't just talk about it.
You have to show your actions.

01:51.999 --> 01:54.999
I have to be honest with you,
part of love is being honest,

01:54.999 --> 02:01.999
and you really  up.
Look, she's trying to make sure

02:01.999 --> 02:06.999
the kids don't get disappointed,
and she's angry, because they've

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
- been disappointed.
- What do you want me to

02:08.999 --> 02:10.999
- do? I mean...
- I want you to see your

02:10.999 --> 02:13.999
kids.
I want you to be a full-time,

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
committed, kick-ass, fabulous
dad.

02:16.999 --> 02:19.999
They miss you.
They need you.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.999
I'm... No.
I don't disagree with any of

02:21.999 --> 02:23.999
- that. It's just...
- 35 years from now, just

02:23.999 --> 02:27.999
like my kids talk about Robert,
I want your kids to have that

02:27.999 --> 02:30.999
same respect for you to know
that "No matter what, my dad

02:30.999 --> 02:36.999
never wavered on his love for
us, no matter what."

02:36.999 --> 02:42.999
And that's all that matters.
Nothing else matters.

02:42.999 --> 02:45.999
- Yeah, I guess.
- All right, you got to

02:45.999 --> 02:48.999
go see the kids.
I'm sure you're sick of

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
listening to me.
Take your little gift you're

02:50.999 --> 02:54.999
gonna bring them,
and I love you.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.000
- I love you, too.
- Can we regroup in the

02:57.000 --> 02:59.999
- morning?
- Yeah.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
Go have dinner, put
them to bed, okay?

03:01.999 --> 03:04.000
- All right.
- And we'll start over

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
- tomorrow with a plan.
- All right.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.999
- I love you.
- Love you.

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
Khlo, are you the
new Kris Jenner?

03:26.999 --> 03:29.999
- Why? What happened?
- First of all, this.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
Okay, what's wrong
with that?

03:31.999 --> 03:36.999
It's not organic.
Then what, what, what, what is

03:36.999 --> 03:39.999
- going on?
- I have guests here.

03:39.999 --> 03:41.999
- It's not just about me.
- This and this and

03:41.999 --> 03:45.000
this. What?!
Now I can't even eat your fruit

03:45.000 --> 03:47.999
here, 'cause I'm not gonna trust
it.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
- Are you joking?
- I dissect your closet.

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
- She dissects your fridge.
- It's all organic.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
Kim, don't sit like
that.

03:53.999 --> 03:56.999
- Your boobs are so huge.
- Yeah, but they're so

03:56.999 --> 03:58.999
awesome.
Well, anyway, I called Kourt the

03:58.999 --> 04:04.999
other day, because I got woken
up because-- you know how, like,

04:04.999 --> 04:07.999
- I'm kind of, like, psychic?
- Ish.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.999
Yeah, psychic...
psychic-ish.

04:10.999 --> 04:14.999
And the other day when I was
sleeping, something woke me up.

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
It whispered in my ear.
It was going, "Khlo, Khlo."

04:16.999 --> 04:19.999
When I heard it, it was a
familiar voice to me.

04:19.999 --> 04:22.999
- It was male.
- Was it young or old?

04:22.999 --> 04:24.999
It was just
comfortable.

04:24.999 --> 04:28.999
Like, I wasn't scared.
I am very spiritual.

04:28.999 --> 04:32.999
I like that I have senses.
I'm in tune with certain things,

04:32.999 --> 04:35.999
and I would like to learn about
these feelings or spirits.

04:35.999 --> 04:38.999
But when I woke up, I kept my
eyes shut, 'cause I was a little

04:38.999 --> 04:41.999
scared, and then, like, nothing
was there.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.999
- Aww.
- This is what you

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- eat?
- I'm not allowed to

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
have peanut butter and celery?
What's wrong with that?

04:48.999 --> 04:49.999
- 'Kay.
- Let me see what's in

04:49.999 --> 04:52.999
this.
Contains two percent molasses,

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
fully hydron... hydrogate...
Huh?

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
God, I know this word.
I can't say it.

04:57.999 --> 05:01.999
- Hydrogenated.
- Yes!

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
Ooh, they put the tile
samples up?

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
- Yeah.
- I like the way that the

05:13.999 --> 05:17.999
smaller ones are wider.
I think you'd have to do that

05:17.999 --> 05:21.000
too narrow, but you're almost a
college graduate.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.999
Wait, you're almost a high
school graduate, so you should

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
know the difference.
So I have one

05:25.999 --> 05:28.999
- week left of school.
- A week?

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
- Yeah.
- And then you're done?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
- Yeah.
- You graduate?

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
- 12th grade.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
preoccupied with everything else
going on, I just figured you

05:37.999 --> 05:40.999
- had a couple months to go.
- No, I'm done in one

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
- week.
- How does that feel?

05:42.999 --> 05:45.999
- Feels good.
- Yeah?

05:45.999 --> 05:49.999
For the last six months, I truly
have not been myself, and when

05:49.999 --> 05:52.999
it comes to my kids, I've been
slacking a little bit.

05:52.999 --> 05:56.999
And I feel bad about where my
head has been, and I've got to

05:56.999 --> 06:00.999
get it together.
My baby's growing up.

06:00.999 --> 06:03.999
You gonna invite me over for
dinner?

06:03.999 --> 06:06.999

And Kendall graduated

- something?
- We'll make our own...

- We'll make our own.
- How fun would that be?

07:10.999 --> 07:13.000
And we'll have their
diplomas there, caps and gowns,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.999

Like, a commencement speaker.

one.

really want to celebrate Kendall

Lately, they've been through a
lot in life, but they have

07:32.999 --> 07:36.999
tremendous, big hearts, great
work ethic, and they really

07:36.999 --> 07:40.999
deserve to be celebrated.

Why are you screwing with me?

your butt.

cannot stand the crazy contour.
The highlight, the highlight

cheeks, the lashes.
Aren't you supposed to look

- of the pregnancy, okay?
- Um, you know how

08:38.999 --> 08:41.999
- Kim had "preclampsha" last time?
- I think it's called

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
- preeclampsia.
- Preeclampsia.

08:43.999 --> 08:44.999
Preeclampsia,
yeah.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
Is there a way to,
like, avoid that?

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
So, it's hard to
say; once you have preeclampsia,

08:48.999 --> 08:51.999
you are at risk for having it
again.

08:51.999 --> 08:55.999
Kim really had a
miserable pregnancy the first

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
time.
She would get crazy headaches

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
- and abdominal pain.
- Oh, that kills.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.999
It feels like I'm in labor.
Why is this happening to me?

09:03.999 --> 09:07.999
It hurts when I cry.

I really want to
make sure that she stays

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
- I'll be fine.
- Hi.

11:11.999 --> 11:13.999
- Hello, how are you?
- How are you?

11:13.999 --> 11:15.999
- Nice to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
I have been really
eager to meet with Tyler, who is

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
- a medium.
- It was kind of an odd

11:19.999 --> 11:21.999
feeling right when I walked in.
It was like there was a feeling

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
like there was something here.

11:29.999 --> 11:33.999
I'd like to get to a
place where, you know, our

11:33.999 --> 11:37.999
family is our family, but at the
same time, I haven't even met

11:37.999 --> 11:41.999
her yet, and I'm not sure--
Do you want to?

11:41.999 --> 11:44.999
To be honest, I'm
scared to death.

11:44.999 --> 11:47.999
- Why?
- I have no idea.

11:47.999 --> 11:53.000
The graduation party is about
celebrating Kendall and Kylie's

11:53.000 --> 11:57.999
amazing achievement and I don't
want anything to distract the

11:57.999 --> 12:00.999
attention from Kendall and
Kylie.

12:00.999 --> 12:03.999
Should we tell Cait
that we're not inviting her?

12:03.999 --> 12:06.999
We should probably
say you're throwing this party

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
and you're just not ready yet to
have her there and we don't want

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
- you to be offended.
- You're allowed

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
- to be honest.
- I just don't think we

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
- say anything.
- She's obviously

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- gonna know.
- Well, I just don't want

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
to make a big deal.

12:26.999 --> 12:29.999
I'm going to get a
piercing.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
- Do you want to come with us?
- I want to get one.

12:31.999 --> 12:33.999
But there's no way I would ever
do it.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
I remember getting my ears
pierced.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.999
I know, you told
me.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.999
- And I hid in Ruby's.
- Ruby's is

12:39.999 --> 12:42.999
- the restaurant.
- Yum!

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
- I know.
- Cheat day?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
Uh, chili cheese
fries.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
- Oreo shakes-- oh.
- Yeah.

12:49.999 --> 12:51.999
- Oh, my God, divine.
- Yeah.

12:51.999 --> 12:55.999
Tyler's here.

12:55.999 --> 12:56.999
- Hi.
- Hello, how are you?

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
How are you?
Nice to meet you.

12:58.999 --> 12:59.999
Great to meet you.
I'm Tyler.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
Khloe.
Thank you for coming.

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
Oh, oh, my gosh, thank
you, this is beautiful.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
Yeah, thank you.
I have been really eager to meet

13:05.999 --> 13:07.999
with Tyler, who is a medium.
He's still young.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
He's 19, I think.
These are my sisters.

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
- Great to meet you.
- You, too.

13:13.999 --> 13:14.999
- Hi, great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:14.999 --> 13:16.999
I actually know
your cousin Kara.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
He works with my
cousin all the time, so I feel

13:18.999 --> 13:22.999
like there's a family connection
and almost it's like cosmic that

13:22.999 --> 13:25.999
I'm supposed to be meeting with
him.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
The general idea of
how I do what I do is that I

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
actually work as a clairvoyant,
so I see information.

13:29.999 --> 13:30.999
Mm-hmm.
- Um, as opposed to

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
audibly hearing it, I get
visuals.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
Did you always know
that you had, like, a gift?

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
When I was ten
years old, my grandmother was

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
ill with terminal cancer, and as
she was getting really ill, I

13:39.999 --> 13:41.999
woke up one night and knew she
was going to pass and we got the

13:41.999 --> 13:44.999
call two minutes later that my
grandmother had passed.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
- Oh, my God, wow.
- And so, that's kind

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
of, uh, was a pretty dramatic
moment, but I believe we all

13:48.999 --> 13:50.999
have an intuition, but to
varying extents.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
She always tells me
she's psychic.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
Well, I don't think I,
like, could read her palm, but I

13:54.999 --> 13:57.000
- have a very great intuition.
- Sure.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And I feel energies
and spirits really well.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.999
- Right.
- And I'm not saying,

14:00.999 --> 14:02.999
"Oh, my God, there's a ghost in
the corner!"

14:02.999 --> 14:04.000
- Right, right, right.
- But I know when I feel

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
something and I, like, pay that
respect.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.999
I think our intuition
is almost like a compass that we

14:07.999 --> 14:09.999
have inside of us, and if we go
with it, it can really

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
drastically improve our life,
so--

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
And if I haven't,
like, how you see things or

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
whatever, if I, that hasn't
happened to me yet, like, would

14:16.999 --> 14:19.999
- that never happen to me?
- It's one of those

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
things that you don't have to
embrace, but if you chose to

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
embrace it and chose to kind of
connect and not be afraid of it,

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
that's the biggest thing.
Fear is the quickest way to shut

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
something down.
You definitely do have that

14:27.999 --> 14:30.999
- really keen intuition.
- Does she?

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
I would say both of
you, out of you two, probably

14:32.999 --> 14:36.999
- the strongest for you two.
- I feel that about you.

14:36.999 --> 14:38.999
I don't feel it about you.

14:38.999 --> 14:42.999
Also interesting to
note, this house has something

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
- in it.
- What do you mean?

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
I don't know.
It's kind of an odd feeling.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
Right when I walked in, it was
like there was a feeling like

14:48.999 --> 14:51.999
there was something here.
This is one of those weird

14:51.999 --> 14:54.000
things that's kind of coming
through.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.999
I'm referencing-- maybe I'm
smelling a tie?

14:57.999 --> 15:00.999
I don't know what this would be.
You know ties, like, for work?

15:00.999 --> 15:03.999
I'm pulling it out, but I'm
holding it my face.

15:03.999 --> 15:08.999
What if it's Dad?
My dad had hundreds of ties and

15:08.999 --> 15:11.999
I'd always smell his stuff.
Like, I have a jacket and his

15:11.999 --> 15:14.999
shirts and I haven't ever washed
them and I just always, like,

15:14.999 --> 15:15.999
- smell them.
- Yeah.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.999
- Aw...
- Yeah.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
Sometimes when people
die, their spirit might be

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999
lingering around because they
feel like there's unfinished

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
business.
And, you know, there's a lot of

15:25.999 --> 15:28.999
things that obviously I wish I
did differently when my dad was

15:28.999 --> 15:31.999
dying and I would avoid seeing
my dad a lot, because I would

15:31.999 --> 15:35.999
rather not see him like that and
I kind of wanted to act like it

15:35.999 --> 15:37.999
- wasn't happening.
- But I believe our

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
loved ones really are okay and
that they do give us signs.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
And that they are definitely
aware of the big events that we

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
go through on some level.
I don't claim to know how it

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
works, but we all have an
intuition and it all comes

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
through in lots of different
ways.

15:47.999 --> 15:48.999
That's new for her,
'cause she used to think I was

15:48.999 --> 15:50.999
ridiculous and then when I--
No I didn't.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
Yeah, but now when I
start telling her things, she'll

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
be like, "Oh, okay," like,
she'll like...

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- ...come over and

15:56.999 --> 15:58.999
entertain me and like, this
one's like, "Yeah, oh, okay,

15:58.999 --> 16:01.999
whatever," like, she's kind of
like, "Sure, whatever."

16:10.999 --> 16:14.999
Where are we sitting--
here?

16:14.999 --> 16:18.999
I just kept on saying, if I get
pregnant again, I'm treating

16:18.999 --> 16:23.999
myself to a night of good meals.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.999
The food in New Orleans is so
amazing.

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
And I've been doing so good.
I work out all the time.

16:28.999 --> 16:34.999
I've been eating so healthy.
So I decided to go for it and

16:34.999 --> 16:37.999
fly across the country to
satisfy my pregnancy cravings

16:37.999 --> 16:41.999
and I'm gonna have a cheat day
and eat whatever I want to eat.

16:41.999 --> 16:44.999
Do you think I-I should post
that and say I'm faking my

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
- pregnancy?
- Oh, my God.

16:46.999 --> 16:48.999
By the way, the
lights in New Orleans would get

16:48.999 --> 16:51.999
shut off if you post that.
Just do it after we eat, so

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
- there's no blackout here.
- 'Cause I need my  crab

16:53.999 --> 16:55.999
- fingers.
- It be so funny!

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
Do you guys have the
crab fingers?

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
- We do.
- Can I for myself get a

16:59.999 --> 17:02.999
- double order?
- Absolutely.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
It's, like, we flew into
town for this.

17:04.999 --> 17:07.999
- You have no idea.
- Mmm, so good.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.999
- Is this, like, a Sriracha sauce?
- This is worth the

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
- trip.
- I know Jonathan.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.999
This is, like, what he's been
dying for.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.999
It is so worth it.
This food is so good.

17:19.999 --> 17:22.999
- This is so good.
- And if I'm gonna enjoy

17:22.999 --> 17:25.999
myself, I need someone that's
really gonna indulge and

17:25.999 --> 17:28.999
Jonathan, he's, like, more of a
foodie than I am.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
I was with her the
last day, the day she gave

17:30.999 --> 17:33.999
birth.
I pushed her into the car and

17:33.999 --> 17:36.999
I, like, shoved her in and she
was, like, literally this big.

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
Everything-- she was, like,
honking with her stomach

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
and boobs.
I swear to God, through the

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
hills and we're driving, I go,
"Slow down, you're freaking me

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
out," and she was like...

17:45.999 --> 17:48.999
And I was all dressed

17:48.999 --> 17:51.999
up.
I am so full.

I'm in Paris having a bunch of
fittings to try and get some

20:38.999 --> 20:41.999
really cool pregnancy looks.
But, of course, I've been, like,

20:41.999 --> 20:44.999
dreaming about the food in
Paris.

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
Anyone that knows me knows that,
like, churros are my thing and

20:47.999 --> 20:51.999
Ferdi has the best churros I've
ever had in my life.

20:51.999 --> 20:55.999
I really came to Paris to eat.
I have no regrets.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
- Like, this is...
- So after the

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
- churros, what is the plan?
- You didn't know?

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
We're gonna break in the store
in the middle of the night and

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
steal what fits me after this.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
Could I have some
water, Mommy?

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
Can I... can I...
Can you just sit with me for a

21:16.999 --> 21:17.999
minute?
You're just the cutest boy in

21:17.999 --> 21:21.999
the world, besides Reign.
You and Reign are in a tie.

21:21.999 --> 21:24.999
- How cute is this?
- I wish it was real.

21:24.999 --> 21:27.999
It is real.
How do you know, at night, it

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
- doesn't come to life?
- At night, it does.

21:29.999 --> 21:32.999
- I know.
- Farting.

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
Okay.

21:35.999 --> 21:39.999
You know we're girls, right?
We don't do farting.

21:39.999 --> 21:44.000

- Farting unicorns.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.999
No.
Okay, do you want to see my

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999

Come on, let's show Mom where

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999

21:54.999 --> 21:59.999
connect with my dad or the other
side on some sort of level, so I

21:59.999 --> 22:03.999
bought this EMF detector and I
don't know, really, if it's

22:03.999 --> 22:06.999
gonna work or not, but... if he
wants to reach out to me, I'll

through the house.

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
'Cause you think
it's haunted.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
No, the house isn't

30:33.999 --> 30:36.999
haunted, there's a difference.
There's spirits that occupy the

30:36.999 --> 30:39.999
- the residence at times.
- I'm scared now.

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
Khloe and Kendall,
Lisa...

30:41.999 --> 30:42.999
Hi, how
are you?

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- We're so excited.
- Oh, I saw you've got

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- some activity.
- Well, I... I think we

30:46.999 --> 30:49.999
do.
After what I found with

30:49.999 --> 30:52.999
Kourtney, my friends hooked me
up with Lisa Williams, who is a

30:52.999 --> 30:55.000
medium, to help verbally
communicate with the spirit in

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
- my house.
- How it works is I'm

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
gonna pick up on the energy.
And I'll just go into different

30:59.000 --> 31:00.999
- areas...
- Okay.

31:00.999 --> 31:02.999
...and I'll tell you
what I'm picking up.

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
I kind of really want to go up
in that direction.

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
- Go, sister.
- So up... Let's go up

31:06.999 --> 31:09.000
here.
I'm drawn over in this

31:09.000 --> 31:11.999
direction, 'cause there's energy
here.

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
I get it in my
bedroom, but also right in that

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
- door...way that we were.
- In that... Where we

31:15.999 --> 31:16.999
- were?
- Yeah, that's where I

31:16.999 --> 31:18.999
- feel it heavily.
- 'Cause it-it's... it

31:18.999 --> 31:22.999
was feeling coming from here.
And then going through here.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- Let me just look.
- Like we're on some

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- kind of hunt.
- 'Cause it's just... it

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
was here though, and I thought
as though it was coming from...

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
Maybe it's running
from you 'cause I'm not alone.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
Oh, I'm gonna actually

31:32.999 --> 31:36.999
ask to step back a little bit.
Only because I'm gonna ask the

31:36.999 --> 31:41.999
spirit to come forward.
Okay, it feels very, um,

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
masculine.
This feels masculine, this is a

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
- masculine energy.
- Masculine, yes.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
- That's what I feel.
- Were you close to a

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
grandfather?
Has a grandfather crossed over?

31:49.999 --> 31:52.999
Mm-hmm.
- He's just said, "Can

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
you say hello to your mom?
Tell her I'm okay.

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
Tell her I'm always watching
over her."

31:56.999 --> 31:57.999
Oh, my God, that's
crazy.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
He loves the music
that's often played, so I feel

31:59.999 --> 32:01.999
as though there's always music
that's played.

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
Yeah, I play music
every day in my house.

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
Oh, do you? Okay.
Well, he loves the fact that you

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
just hang around and dance and
sing to it, you know?

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
Mm-hmm.
- Um, but, uh, can you

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
- not sing?
- No, I can't sing.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
It's just that...

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
Don't tell on me.
Geez.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
Oh, busted.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
But he's doing okay.
He really is.

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
Oh, good.
I am really happy to hear that

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
it's my grandfather who is
talking to me.

32:24.999 --> 32:27.999
It makes me feel good to know
that he's watching over me and

32:27.999 --> 32:30.999
- doing okay.
- Any questions?

32:30.999 --> 32:33.999
No, I mean, if you,
like, if I want to talk to

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
- someone, can you...?
- I was gonna...

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- That's what I was gonna...
- Yeah.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
What? Who do you want
to talk to?

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
Your dad. I don't
know if you...

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah.

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
Do you want to sit down
somewhere real...?

32:43.999 --> 32:44.999
- Yeah, let's go sit.
- All right.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
Is that a thing,
though?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
Can you try and reach out to
someone?

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
Oh, no, I can,
absolutely.

32:50.999 --> 32:58.999
All right.
Do you want to know everything?

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
- Hello?
- Hi.

33:00.999 --> 33:04.999
- I just got tested for diabetes.
- I have your results on

33:04.999 --> 33:08.999
- my desk here.
- They're here.

33:08.999 --> 33:11.999
They're here?
This is such an amazing step in

33:11.999 --> 33:15.999
the girls' lives, and I really,
really hope that they're

33:15.999 --> 33:18.999
- surprised.
- Shut the  up.

33:18.999 --> 33:25.999
- They're coming.
- Surprise!

33:25.999 --> 33:29.999
- ♪ ♪- Do you want to know

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
everything?

33:34.999 --> 33:37.999
The way that he's coming through
is-is a great deal of energy.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.999
- You talk to him often.
Mm-hmm.

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
Why is he celebrating
July?

33:42.999 --> 33:45.999
- July.
- Ask your mom.

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
- I think your mom might know.
- Okay.

33:47.999 --> 33:49.999
And also there's a
tattoo.

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
Who's got the tattoo to
commemorate your dad?

33:51.999 --> 33:54.999
Um, I'm not sure if it's his
initials or, like, handwriting

33:54.999 --> 33:56.999
or words-- it's something very
simple.

33:56.999 --> 33:58.999
- I do.
- Okay, there you go.

33:58.999 --> 34:00.999
- It's his handwriting.
- Right, 'cause he's

34:00.999 --> 34:02.999
acknowledging the tattoo that
commemorates him as well.

34:02.999 --> 34:06.999
- That's so cool.
- He's also sorry he

34:06.999 --> 34:09.999
never got a chance to say
good-bye.

34:09.999 --> 34:12.999
He's just said he loves you with
all his heart.

34:12.999 --> 34:15.999
He loves you to the moon and
back.

34:15.999 --> 34:21.999
He's so proud of you.
He's so proud of the family.

34:21.999 --> 34:25.999
My dad and I were
really, really, really close.

34:25.999 --> 34:29.999
And I believe all of our
blessings that we have now are

34:29.999 --> 34:32.999
because we have a guardian
angel, which is my dad, by our

34:32.999 --> 34:35.999
sides.
And, I mean, I pray to my dad

34:35.999 --> 34:38.999
every day.
Talk to him every single day.

34:38.999 --> 34:42.999
And so to finally hear him talk
back, like, is just beyond

34:42.999 --> 34:45.999
words.
It's like a dream.

34:45.999 --> 34:49.999
Hello?

34:49.999 --> 34:51.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:51.999 --> 34:54.999
My dad and Papa Harry
said hi.

34:54.999 --> 34:56.999
- How do you know?
- We were with a psychic

34:56.999 --> 34:59.999
- at my house.
- Aw...

34:59.999 --> 35:02.999
What's wrong?

35:02.999 --> 35:05.999
I talk to those two all
the time.

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
What's in July that my
dad's celebrating?

35:12.999 --> 35:17.999
- July 8, my anniversary.
- Oh, my God!

35:17.999 --> 35:20.999
My mom is confirming
basically everything that this

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
girl said, and that's kind of
freaky.

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
I mean, thinking back to it, she
definitely was saying some legit

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
- things.
- And the person who

35:26.999 --> 35:29.999
whispers in my ear, that's Papa
Harry.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
- And he is super happy.
- Oh, my God.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
Everybody's having more fun
than we are.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
But that's what she
was saying.

35:35.999 --> 35:38.999
She's like, for us, 'cause we
miss the attachment of being

35:38.999 --> 35:41.999
with someone, but you're just
way happier in Heaven, so, like,

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
we get lonely, but they're
straight chillin'.

35:43.999 --> 35:46.000
- Chillin'.
- Aw.

35:52.999 --> 35:58.000
Hi. Can I help you?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.999
Hi.
It's Kim Kardashian West.

36:00.999 --> 36:03.999
I just wanted to see if you guys
got the results back from my

36:03.999 --> 36:06.999
- blood test.
- Yeah, hold on.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.999
I just got tested for
diabetes, and just to know that

36:09.999 --> 36:14.999
- there could be issues is scary.
- Hello.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
- Hi.
- I have your

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
results on my desk here.

36:24.999 --> 36:27.999
- Hello.
- Hi.

36:27.999 --> 36:30.999
I have your
results on my desk here.

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
Are you really that freaked out
about it or is that just getting

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
- to the news?
- I'm dying to see if I

36:34.999 --> 36:37.999
- have diabetes.
- I can say this.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
You never know who's gonna have
really have those kind of

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
problems, but you did pass the
diabetes test.

36:41.999 --> 36:45.999
Thank God.
I mean, I felt really relieved

36:45.999 --> 36:48.999
that I don't have diabetes.
I have been eating bad, so I'm

36:48.999 --> 36:51.999
trying to do everything that I
can to eat healthy and be

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
- healthy.
- So I'm gonna see

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
- you what-- in two weeks?
- Yeah.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.999
Okay, that sounds
great.

36:57.999 --> 36:58.999
- Perfect.
- All right, Kim--

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
I'll talk to you soon.
Thank you.

37:00.999 --> 37:01.999
- All right.
- Bye.

37:11.999 --> 37:14.999
Yes!
They're gonna die.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.999
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so excited

37:17.999 --> 37:20.999
- about the photo booth.
- Come on, Mase!

37:20.999 --> 37:24.999
Yeah!

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
Thank you for coming.
They'll be so surprised.

37:26.999 --> 37:27.999
Oh, my God, I'm so
I'm so excited.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
- You look beautiful.
- This is so cool-- the

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
- hot dog stand and everything.
- Yeah, and then we have

37:31.999 --> 37:33.999
the sushi bar.
And there's a great deejay.

37:33.999 --> 37:38.999
We're about to get drinking.
It's the day of the graduation

37:38.999 --> 37:43.999
party, and I'm super excited.
You look beautiful.

37:43.999 --> 37:46.999
- Look at you!
- How are you?

37:46.999 --> 37:48.999
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
- Yeah.
- You'll tell us when

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
they're, like, close, right?
Are you dancing?

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999
- Welcome to the party.
- Oh, hi!

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

37:57.999 --> 37:59.999
This is so funny.
They're gonna die.

37:59.999 --> 38:00.999
Oh, my God,
it's gonna be great.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
But I never got a
graduation anything, so

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
- everyone!
- I know, I know, I know.

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
No, it's so mean.
So will you just shout me out?

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
Yeah, I might give
you a little love.

38:08.999 --> 38:10.999
- Yeah!
- Okay, they came through

38:10.999 --> 38:13.999
the gate-- quiet.
This is such an amazing step in

38:13.999 --> 38:17.999
the girls' lives, and I really,
really hope that they're

38:17.999 --> 38:20.999
- surprised.
- Shh, shut the  up.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.999
- They're coming!
- Mom, the language.

38:23.999 --> 38:26.999
- They're here.
- They're here?

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
Okay, everyone stand up.
When they walk through the door,

38:28.999 --> 38:32.999
I want a "surprise" as loud as
you can.

38:32.999 --> 38:34.000
Shh!

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
Surprise!

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
- They're here.
- They're here?

38:45.999 --> 38:47.999
Okay, everyone stand up.
When they walk through the door,

38:47.999 --> 38:50.999
I want a "surprise" as loud as
you can.

38:50.999 --> 38:57.999
- Shh!
- Surprise!

38:57.999 --> 39:03.999
This is so weird!

39:03.999 --> 39:07.999
What is happening?

39:07.999 --> 39:11.999
I think so.
It's amazing!

39:11.999 --> 39:14.999
Welcome to your
graduation!

39:14.999 --> 39:19.999
It is such an awesome
feeling seeing everybody and it

39:19.999 --> 39:24.000
means so much that my mom put
this together.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.999
I would've never planned a
graduation for myself and I just

39:27.999 --> 39:30.999
think it's really sweet and I'll
remember it forever.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.999
Hey, I would've worn something
so much cuter if I knew this was

39:32.999 --> 39:35.999
- my graduation.
- Hey, hi.

39:35.999 --> 39:37.999
Let's get the party
started.

39:37.999 --> 39:39.999
This is so adorable.

39:39.999 --> 39:42.999
Welcome to your
graduation ceremony.

39:42.999 --> 39:45.999
To make it official, we have a
cap and gown for both of you.

39:45.999 --> 39:49.999
So Kris is going to escort you

39:49.999 --> 39:51.999
- to the graduation wardrobe.
- Come on, ladies.

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
And you'll come back
with a cap and gown and we'll

39:53.999 --> 39:56.999
- see your face, all right?
- I'm so confused.

39:56.999 --> 39:59.999
- This is so funny.
- You look so cute.

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
Someone said, "Is
Kylie having a graduation?

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
I got invited."
And I said, "No!"

40:03.999 --> 40:05.999
What? Wait, someone
said that to me, too.

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
Someone said that to
me and I was like, "No."

40:07.999 --> 40:09.999
The graduation party was really
sweet and really cute.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.999
A little bit late, but really
sweet and really cute.

40:12.999 --> 40:15.999
- Grab me heels, Kylie, come in!
- Just wear those.

40:15.999 --> 40:17.999
- Who cares?
- Khloe, you did make a

40:17.999 --> 40:19.999
point of, uh, saying that you
have not graduated yet, so--

40:19.999 --> 40:22.999
- No, I graduated.
- You didn't have your

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
- ceremony?
- No, nobody cared.

40:24.999 --> 40:27.000
So, we have a cap and
gown for you as well, yes.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.999
Come on, Khloe.
Khloe, come with me.

40:30.999 --> 40:33.999
Come on, Khloe!

40:33.999 --> 40:36.999
It's my graduation
party, too.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
I do feel bad I was giving my
mom such a hard time, because

40:38.999 --> 40:42.999
now I'm a part of this
extravaganza!

40:42.999 --> 40:45.999
- Let's go.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

40:45.999 --> 40:49.999
please welcome the graduates of
2014 and 2015, Kendall and

40:49.999 --> 40:52.999
Kylie!

40:52.999 --> 40:57.999
The music?
I can't.

40:57.999 --> 41:01.999
And up next, graduate
Khloe Kardashian.

41:01.999 --> 41:04.999
Yay, Khloe!

41:04.999 --> 41:10.999
Yes! Yes! Yes!

41:10.999 --> 41:15.999
Esteemed guests, we are
gathered here today to celebrate

41:15.999 --> 41:19.999
- a victory.
- This is amazing!

41:19.999 --> 41:22.999
It's more than an
ending, it's also a beginning;

41:22.999 --> 41:26.999
a celebration of what's to come.
We have the perfect person to

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
give you the commencement
speech.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.999
Well, all right, okay,
okay.

41:30.999 --> 41:34.999
Okay, well, I wasn't gonna say

41:34.999 --> 41:37.999
anything, because all I ever do
up here is cry.

41:37.999 --> 41:40.999
I just want to say that--
There you go,

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- there you go.
- See, this is why I

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
don't do this.
I'm just really proud of you

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
guys.
I'm proud of your hearts.

41:46.999 --> 41:49.999
Just keep reaching for the
stars, because you can have

41:49.999 --> 41:52.999
anything that you set your
hearts to and I know that if

41:52.999 --> 41:55.999
anybody can do it, you guys can,
because you've already proven to

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
all of us that you're rock
stars.

41:57.999 --> 41:59.999
- Yeah!
- Yeah, I love you guys

41:59.999 --> 42:02.999
so much.
And I think we should go outside

42:02.999 --> 42:05.999
and have a drink!

42:05.999 --> 42:09.999
I am always in such awe
of my mom and how she makes

42:09.999 --> 42:13.999
every kid feel so special.
Her throwing this party is such

42:13.999 --> 42:17.999
a cool thing for her to do for
Kendall and Kylie and, you know,

42:17.999 --> 42:20.999
I think my mom's just such a
good example for me of the kind

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
of mom that I want to be and the
kind of attention I want to give

42:22.999 --> 42:25.999
my kids.
And I'm so glad that I have her

42:25.999 --> 42:28.999
- there as my role model.
- One, two, three!

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
Hey, guys, there's
synchronized swimmers!

42:36.999 --> 42:39.999
- So much fun!
- Yes!

42:39.999 --> 42:42.999
This is for you.
And you, missy, because I'm

42:42.999 --> 42:47.999
proud of you, too.

42:47.999 --> 42:50.999
- Oh!
- Thanks, Mom!

42:50.999 --> 42:53.999
- I love you!
- I love you, too.

42:53.999 --> 42:56.999
Oh, thank you!
I graduated and I'm partying!

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
- I love you.
- I'm so proud of you.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.999
You're such a good person and
that's all that matters to me.

43:00.999 --> 43:02.999
- You're my heart, okay?
- I love you.

43:02.999 --> 43:05.999
- All right.
- This party is just

43:05.999 --> 43:08.999
like a celebration of all of our
lives and us as a family

43:08.999 --> 43:13.999
and that we will always be okay.
We always will.

43:13.999 --> 43:18.999
On the next episode...

43:18.999 --> 43:20.999
- What is that?
- We're doing

43:20.999 --> 43:22.999
- a good workout.
- I think we need

43:22.999 --> 43:24.999
boundaries.
Definitely we need some

43:24.999 --> 43:26.999
- boundaries.
- Kanye just, like,

43:26.999 --> 43:28.999
- loves being here?
- They both do!

43:28.999 --> 43:31.999
I haven't even met Caitlyn.
I don't know if I could handle

43:31.999 --> 43:33.999
- it.
- With Kylie's birthday

43:33.999 --> 43:35.999
coming up, I hope they can just
put their differences aside.

43:35.999 --> 43:37.999
article
killed me.

43:37.999 --> 43:39.999
- What did I say?
- Are you kidding?!

43:39.999 --> 43:40.999
Caitlyn is late.
This is rude.

43:40.999 --> 43:42.999
I'm starting to get
nervous if she'll even show up.
