[Xander]
Previously on Siren.

00:05.540 --> 00:06.950
[Ryn]
Who do you think about?

00:06.960 --> 00:09.246
[Maddie]
I think about Ben...

00:09.250 --> 00:10.285
and you.

00:10.290 --> 00:11.325
The others.

00:11.330 --> 00:13.070
I bring together.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.116
Come. Home.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.202
I think we can help each other.
That's your problem.

00:17.210 --> 00:19.280
You want to get
back in the water,
I want that, too.

00:19.290 --> 00:22.248
And you, you're gonna help me
get the one who killed my dad.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.286
Looks like they found
something down there

00:24.290 --> 00:26.167
when they were dragging,
that sonic cannon,
mapping the ocean.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.070
-[Ben] What did they find?
-Oil.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.241
This is gonna
destroy our waters,
you know that, right?

00:30.250 --> 00:31.956
[Ted] What do you want me
to do about it?

00:31.960 --> 00:33.530
Because, you know,
we can't stop progress.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.531
[Susan]
Glen was my dealer.

00:35.540 --> 00:37.326
I knew where he was staying,
so I went there.

00:37.330 --> 00:40.288
[Maddie] I find your ring,
and we move forward.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.109
Who the hell are you?

00:41.120 --> 00:42.826
-[knee lands]
-[Maddie groans]

00:43.960 --> 00:45.075
-Aah!
-[snap]

00:56.710 --> 00:58.246
Come. Now.

01:00.830 --> 01:02.377
I bring her.

01:02.380 --> 01:04.530
-Mom...
-[gasp51

01:04.540 --> 01:06.371
Mom? Mom.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.608
-Oh, my God!
-We--

01:07.620 --> 01:08.746
Oh, my God.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.115
We found him
like this, okay?

01:12.120 --> 01:13.610
Your father comes
back tonight, right?

01:13.620 --> 01:14.746
Yeah.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.781
Call him.
Call your dad.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.418
[high-pitched call]

01:58.960 --> 02:00.370
Mom left something here,
and we just--

02:00.380 --> 02:01.415
Shh!

02:17.830 --> 02:18.819
Levi?

02:36.210 --> 02:37.199
Is anybody here?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.075
[Susan] It's my fault.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.241
The girls were
trying to help me.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.205
[Maddie]
Mom wasn't here when it...

02:45.790 --> 02:47.200
when we found him.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.662
Well, it looks like he had
some kind of accident.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.206
Yeah.

02:53.210 --> 02:54.450
Did you call
the sheriff's station?

02:54.460 --> 02:57.372
We can't be part
of anything like this

02:57.380 --> 03:01.032
because of Ryn's visa status.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.242
Well, then I guess I'll
have to take care of this.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.956
Why don't you take
your mother home?

03:09.960 --> 03:11.166
Let's go.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.455
Ryn.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.449
I'll take care
of Ryn.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.529
She can fill me in.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.491
Where you staying
these days?

03:17.500 --> 03:18.615
With Maddie.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.326
We share an apartment.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.820
I guess we'll be
talking about that later.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.530
[clattering]

03:49.000 --> 03:50.069
Where's Viv?

03:54.420 --> 03:55.535
-[glass breaks]
-[hisses]

03:55.540 --> 03:57.371
Shh. Quiet.

04:00.380 --> 04:01.449
Oh!

04:02.500 --> 04:03.956
[sighs] Tsk!

04:05.330 --> 04:08.379
I put that deadbolt on
to keep you safe,

04:08.380 --> 04:11.326
and you go and smash
your fool hand
through the glass!

04:14.960 --> 04:17.281
Keep pressure on it
until the bleeding stops.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.495
[hisses]

04:23.500 --> 04:24.319
Hey, now.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.456
[hisses]

04:25.460 --> 04:27.530
Sorry you're
not happy here,

04:27.540 --> 04:30.247
but that's_ no reason
to turn against a friend.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.615
[cell phone buzzes]

04:53.500 --> 04:55.070
[laughs]

05:38.080 --> 05:39.286
What the--

05:41.290 --> 05:42.370
No way.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.495
[hisses]

05:44.500 --> 05:46.536
[laughing]

05:46.540 --> 05:48.076
You don't even know
how to use that, do you?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.991
[groans]

05:58.750 --> 05:59.876
This one.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.201
He kill your mother.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.199
You're her daughter?

06:03.210 --> 06:04.916
-[growls]
-Not kill.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.376
Need him.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.245
To move boat.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.820
[grunts]

06:13.120 --> 06:14.496
You kill later.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.456
No, no! No, no!

06:24.920 --> 06:26.569
Aw, hell, no.

06:32.580 --> 06:35.208
We're just trying
to keep you safe.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.667
So we lock it.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.534
[lock clicks]

06:38.540 --> 06:40.371
[clicks]

06:43.080 --> 06:44.911
I know you
don't understand me.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.115
No locks
in the ocean, right?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.576
[chuckles]

06:54.750 --> 06:57.036
Eliza, take Viv upstairs.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.109
[hisses]

06:58.120 --> 06:59.109
Go now.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.615
Well, hello.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.610
You...

07:20.620 --> 07:21.575
here.

07:21.580 --> 07:22.569
Yes.

07:22.580 --> 07:23.569
Me...

07:25.750 --> 07:27.115
here.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.328
Oh. Okay.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.746
The man. He hurt Maddie.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.418
So you killed him.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.569
Yes.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.076
You saved my daughter's life.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.617
I'll never be able
to thank you enough.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.320
She means everything to me.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.535
Maddie is love.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.532
But you must know,
this is bad.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.996
It's a big mess.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.615
Mess?

08:07.620 --> 08:10.703
We have laws on land
that cannot be broken.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.701
_ You can't
Just kill someone,

08:12.710 --> 08:14.496
even if it seems
like the right thing to do.

08:15.750 --> 08:16.739
Why?

08:16.750 --> 08:18.160
Because it's the law.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.820
It keeps people safe.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.661
Maddie not safe.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.530
No, she wasn't.

08:30.380 --> 08:31.950
But killing people is wrong.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.160
Always?

08:44.620 --> 08:49.159
I... sorry... for...

08:49.170 --> 08:50.489
[groans]

08:51.960 --> 08:53.996
Sorry... for... kill--

She...

09:44.790 --> 09:46.030
She tell me.

09:48.460 --> 09:49.870
To kill.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.666
Oh, so Hurricane Katrina
just made you do it?

09:51.670 --> 09:53.069
What, you can't
think for yourself?

09:58.830 --> 10:01.572
[footsteps on deck]

10:05.710 --> 10:08.702
Stupid mermaid. Locked me up
and left me with a phone.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.740
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Wait.

10:13.750 --> 10:14.956
Is that you or me?

10:14.960 --> 10:17.076
-Who cares_? Focus.
-[buzznng]

10:17.080 --> 10:18.240
Okay, yeah.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.286
I_t's three o'clock
In the morning.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.871
Yeah, it's three o'clock
in the morning.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.279
Go away!

10:30.500 --> 10:31.706
Wait, wait, one second.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.536
[sighs] It's Xander.

10:36.540 --> 10:38.246
Well, it's him or me.

10:39.830 --> 10:41.206
-[Calvin] Hey...
-Oh, thank God.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.199
-Look, Calvin, I just.
-This is Calvin.

10:42.210 --> 10:43.746
Leave me a message.

10:43.750 --> 10:44.785
Or better yet,
send me some money.

10:44.790 --> 10:47.281
Oh, shit.
Look, man, just, um,

10:47.290 --> 10:48.826
call me back_as soon
as you get this, okay?

10:50.830 --> 10:51.910
[whispers] Idiot.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.741
[cell phone buzzes]

10:57.750 --> 10:59.490
Xander?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.821
Hey, Ben, I got no reception,
so I gotta make this quick.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.115
Okay, what's happening?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.576
That whacked out mermaid
that I rescued?

11:04.580 --> 11:06.161
She came back.

11:06.170 --> 11:07.706
She locked me in the hold
of the North Star.

11:07.710 --> 11:08.950
-What?
-Yeah.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.915
With the one
who killed my dad.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.376
He's on the boat?

11:11.380 --> 11:12.950
Yeah. She locked him
in here with me--

11:12.960 --> 11:14.746
that angry one.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.286
Now get your ass
over here and get me out.

11:17.290 --> 11:19.497
[tires screech]

11:22.920 --> 11:24.740
Oh. [laughs]

11:24.750 --> 11:25.910
Thank you.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.705
Mm.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.535
Oh.

11:38.420 --> 11:40.206
[laughs]

11:42.880 --> 11:46.532
You and I, we had
a moment, didn't we?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.496
Back in the warehouse.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.569
Mm.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.917
You here.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.912
Me here.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.822
Oh. You want
to stay here with me?

12:05.830 --> 12:07.115
Mm.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.666
[engine stops]

12:15.420 --> 12:16.569
Okay, Ryn.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.787
So how do I say this?

12:20.670 --> 12:22.490
You know, my people,

12:22.500 --> 12:25.037
we tell stories
of shape-shifters,

12:25.040 --> 12:26.416
creatures like you.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.877
Shape-shifter like me.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.828
Yes. And in those stories,
the ones like you

12:33.920 --> 12:36.115
often represent the idea

12:36.120 --> 12:38.327
of _two worlds
coming together.

12:45.790 --> 12:46.950
Together.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.875
In the myths,
they are very powerful

12:51.880 --> 12:54.371
and can be responsible
for many things.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.240
The entire universe.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.075
They can change the world.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.031
And that change
can be peaceful, good,

13:08.330 --> 13:09.410
or violent.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.035
Can kill?

13:13.330 --> 13:15.992
Yes, sometimes.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.702
But maybe
that's your calling,

13:19.710 --> 13:22.076
to lead my kind
and your kind

13:22.080 --> 13:25.322
to a peaceful existence
in this new world.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.700
What happen now?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.746
[sighs]

13:32.750 --> 13:34.377
Now I clean up
the mess.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.029
And you think
about what you've done.

13:37.540 --> 13:38.700
Think?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.913
Think. Think
before you do anything.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.412
[gas can clattering]

15:15.620 --> 15:17.201
-[whispering] Come on!
-Okay, all right.

15:17.210 --> 15:19.451
Whoa! Where do you
think you're going?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.109
Xander, don't be
stupid right now.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.826
We're taking him with us!
You okay?

15:22.830 --> 15:23.990
You gotta be kidding me.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.240
-He's coming with us!
-No, man!

15:25.250 --> 15:26.456
[footsteps]

15:26.460 --> 15:29.031
-She heard us.
-[Levi groans]

15:29.040 --> 15:30.416
Go go go go go!

15:32.830 --> 15:33.910
[whispers] Hey.

15:36.380 --> 15:38.109
-Hey!

15:52.620 --> 15:53.746
[Ben] Hey.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.780
-[Ben] Go go go!
-[Xander] Help!

16:02.170 --> 16:03.956
[Xander]
Ah, he's heaw.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.909
[Ben]
Come on, Xan!

16:07.920 --> 16:08.909
Come on!

16:09.920 --> 16:11.319
[groaning]

16:16.330 --> 16:18.070

16:24.750 --> 16:26.240
My God.

16:29.710 --> 16:31.701
[screaming]

16:55.710 --> 16:57.109
You live.

17:03.460 --> 17:06.532
Come. To family.

17:07.710 --> 17:08.916
To water.

17:21.960 --> 17:22.949
No.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.370
Not safe.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.200
With Ryn.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.199
[hisses]

17:32.120 --> 17:33.030
[lock clicks]

17:34.920 --> 17:37.741
All with Ryn will die!

17:41.120 --> 17:43.327
Maddie, I would have
never let you go in that room

17:43.330 --> 17:44.957
if I knew Glen was there.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.997
I know, Mom.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.321
I am done
with all that.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.740
Trust me.

17:57.330 --> 17:58.206
Wha--

18:10.880 --> 18:12.199
Try and get some rest.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.417
[Xander] Okay,
how is it possible

18:49.420 --> 18:51.661
that you guys don't have
any liquor anywhere?

18:51.670 --> 18:53.661
Filing cabinet,
top drawer.

18:53.670 --> 18:54.739
Right.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.240
This sucks, man.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.992
Why do you think
she came after you
and your boat?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.740
Who knows, man?
She's a psycho.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.950
Or maybe she thought she
could use me and the boat

19:12.960 --> 19:17.283
to stop Klesco
from screwing up the water
for her and her friends.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.666
Where'd she get that idea?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.111
She wouldn't know
any of that on her own.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.499
She got the idea 'cause
I'm a stupid idiot, okay?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.910
I took her there.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.319
I showed her Klesco's boats.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.285
I mean, all that stuff.

19:32.290 --> 19:33.450
What did you do, Xander?

19:35.500 --> 19:36.910
I tried to make
a deal with her.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.876
I told her that

19:38.880 --> 19:41.371
I would help her
stop the oil company and...

19:42.920 --> 19:44.205
she'd help me kill him.

19:44.210 --> 19:47.077
You were never
going to kill him, Xan.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.411
You couldn't.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.911
I was just trying to do
right by my dad, man.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.035
I should've done it, too,

19:56.040 --> 19:57.166
when I had the chance.

19:57.170 --> 19:59.320
You did
the right thing, okay?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.030
It's what your dad
would've wanted.

20:08.670 --> 20:10.035
So you made a deal with her?

20:13.040 --> 20:14.371
I thought I did.
I don't know.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.371
What do you think
she's gonna do next?

20:16.380 --> 20:17.699
I have no clue, man.
She's bat shit.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.666
She take back.

20:19.670 --> 20:21.820
-She take what back?
-Us.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.411
Good. That's
exactly what we want,

20:23.420 --> 20:24.876
get her scaly ass
back in the water.

20:28.670 --> 20:29.659
Dude,
what's the deal, huh?

20:29.670 --> 20:31.114
Hey, man, um...

20:31.120 --> 20:32.826
What the hell?
Why did you text me

20:32.830 --> 20:34.286
to meet you here
in the middle
of the night, huh?

20:34.290 --> 20:35.530
What are you
doing here?

20:35.540 --> 20:36.495
What am I doing here?

20:36.500 --> 20:37.535
[Ben] Calvin?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.450
This is Levi.

20:42.710 --> 20:43.825
I know him.

20:46.710 --> 20:47.745
He's the one.

20:47.750 --> 20:48.876
Yeah.

20:51.330 --> 20:52.410
He's the one.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.992
A little bedtime snack.

21:05.000 --> 21:05.989
Sardines.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.319
[can opens]

21:07.330 --> 21:10.743
Sorry. From a can.
It's all I have.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.320
Mm.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.991
-You.
-Oh, yes.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.207
Women first, that's
how you prefer it.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.495
Mm.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.417
-Okay, your turn.
-Mm.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.535
Ah! [laughs]

21:25.540 --> 21:27.451
Here, try this.

21:28.790 --> 21:30.075
Mm.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.535
Yes.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.872
[laughs] Yes.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.370
-Mm.
-[laughing]

22:14.830 --> 22:16.491
[knock on door]

22:16.500 --> 22:17.990
[man] Come on, Glen,
what's goin' on, man?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.615
Whole town's up my ass
waitin' on this haul.

22:19.620 --> 22:21.668
[cell phone buzzing]

22:23.460 --> 22:25.576
-[knocking]
-Your car's in the lot, dude!

22:25.580 --> 22:26.660
I know you're here!

22:58.250 --> 22:59.410
I am sorry.

23:00.750 --> 23:01.785
No.

23:03.170 --> 23:06.537
Ryn, you saved my life.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.286
I make trouble for you.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.536
You have nothing
to apologize for.

23:47.710 --> 23:49.701
[shower running]

24:15.620 --> 24:16.496
[text alert chimes]

24:35.120 --> 24:37.611
All right, look, Xan,
you're my buddy,

24:37.620 --> 24:40.498
all right?
But you're also my boss,

24:42.040 --> 24:44.998
and, honestly, you've been
a real piss poor boss

24:46.670 --> 24:47.989
Yeah.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.781
What kind of idiot makes
a deal with a wild animal?

24:56.170 --> 24:58.320
[man in video]
...to make an impact
on the fishing industry.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.246
[music playing in The Anchor]

25:31.500 --> 25:33.786
-Hey.
-Hey, man.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.576
I'm glad that you texted.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.417
I got something big
to add to the story.

25:39.420 --> 25:42.457
It looks like my father--

25:45.380 --> 25:47.701
he's is in bed with big oil.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.666
Great story.

25:55.750 --> 25:56.739
What do you mean?

25:56.750 --> 25:58.320
They're not gonna air it.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.917
They killed it.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.535
Who killed it?

26:05.540 --> 26:08.703
The soulless bloodsuckers
at the network.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.746
Well, them and the soulless
bloodsuckers at the oil company

26:10.750 --> 26:12.536
that sponsors the network.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.076
We can't let them do this.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.877
We can't stop them.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.165
We live in a world
that's controlled

26:17.170 --> 26:18.706
by the same people
who are destroying it.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.666
Look, I fought for this,
believe me.

26:22.250 --> 26:23.786
This isn't a hill
I'm ready to die on.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.109
[Elaine] Good morning.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.610
Hey.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.668
-[Ted] Ben.
-[Doug] What's up?

26:33.670 --> 26:36.662
Did you have anything
to do with killing
the Klesco Oil story?

26:36.670 --> 26:39.616
Uh, what's he talking about?
What-- What story?

26:39.620 --> 26:41.827
You knew KFGT
was doing a story.

26:41.830 --> 26:43.821
Did you tell them
to shut it down?

26:43.830 --> 26:46.242
I'm flattered you think
I have that kind of power.

26:46.250 --> 26:47.911
[chuckles]

26:47.920 --> 26:50.241
What's this?

26:50.250 --> 26:53.959
Huh? You said
that you had no pull
with the oil company.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.575
You're working with them.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.076
Dad, you lied to me.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.707
Whoa, nobody lied to anybody.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.917
You asked me if I could
do anything to stop them,

27:01.920 --> 27:03.456
and I said no.

27:03.460 --> 27:04.996
The deal wasn't done
until this morning.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.536
Deal?

27:07.790 --> 27:09.417
What are you
doing with them?

27:13.750 --> 27:14.739
It was my idea, Ben.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.787
Pownall Seafood's leasing
Klesco a strip of land
for a pipeline.

27:22.080 --> 27:26.779
All right, so--
so you are helping them
bring oil on land.

27:26.790 --> 27:27.825
Why?

27:27.830 --> 27:30.207
Because, Ben,
this town needs jobs,

27:30.210 --> 27:31.746
and this project
will create them.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.741
Your father's helping
make that happen.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.789
And I'm getting sick and tired
of apologizing for it, frankly.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.166
Ben, come on,
you're an environmentalist.

27:39.170 --> 27:40.740
You know these projects,
these companies,

27:40.750 --> 27:42.911
have way less impact
than they used to.

27:42.920 --> 27:47.573
We just had a beach
full of dead whales, Mom.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.956
That's their impact.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.326
All the rest
is just bullshit PR.

27:53.210 --> 27:55.417
They're moving in
whether we like it or not.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.911
This town needs representation.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.957
How are you
representing the town?

28:00.960 --> 28:03.076
By handing them your land?

28:03.080 --> 28:05.787
We hold the lease.
That gives us power
in the decision-making.

28:05.790 --> 28:08.418
If we don't stay involved,
this town has no say at all.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.035
You want
to stay Involved? Okay.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.666
Tell them no.

28:13.670 --> 28:15.490
Make some noise, Dad.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.377
Do something.

28:25.790 --> 28:26.870
Screw it.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.780
Come on, Ben,

28:28.790 --> 28:30.917
there must be a way we can
meet in the middle here.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.917
No, Mom, there isn't.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.614
Hey. Hey. Hey.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.208
Maddie, I--
I tried to reach you.

29:26.540 --> 29:27.529
What happened?

29:30.920 --> 29:32.490
Hey, come on.

29:37.080 --> 29:37.876
[Ben]
Did he hurt you?

29:38.920 --> 29:39.909
No.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.075
She stopped him.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.917
She saved my life, Ben.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.202
[cell phone ringing]

29:52.210 --> 29:53.746
Where's Ryn?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.490
Katrina's
on the war path.

30:12.040 --> 30:12.825
So who was he?

30:15.710 --> 30:18.076
His name was Glen.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.029
Glen Jenkins.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.615
He was a dealer
In Port Angeles.

30:23.620 --> 30:24.826
Your dealer?

30:24.830 --> 30:27.492
For a while, yeah.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.070
ButI hadn't seen him lately.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.822
I'd been clean for a month
before I came back.

30:33.420 --> 30:34.910
I swear.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.615
Then I don't understand,

30:36.620 --> 30:38.997
'cause you'd been clean here
with us for almost a year.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.490
What happened?

30:40.500 --> 30:42.206
I don't know. There was...

30:42.210 --> 30:44.075
an extra minute in the day.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.321
You could've told me.

30:46.330 --> 30:47.410
I would've helped.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.490
Like I always did.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.035
Again.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.240
I was
at the supermarket.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.206
I was high as a kite,

31:01.210 --> 31:03.667
and I thought,
"I can't go home.
I can't do this again."

31:06.330 --> 31:07.376
So I ran.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.203
And someone
introduced me to Glen.

31:12.210 --> 31:14.917
And I needed a place to stay,
and he had one.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.490
How long were you with him?

31:19.120 --> 31:19.916
Eight months.

31:21.580 --> 31:25.698
I was just staying there,
cooking and cleaning and--

31:28.080 --> 31:29.069
And then, uh,

31:31.960 --> 31:33.700
things got really bad.

31:33.710 --> 31:34.916
He hit you.

31:34.920 --> 31:35.989
Yeah.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.163
And then I found out
how big his business was.

31:43.170 --> 31:44.910
His business?

31:44.920 --> 31:47.161
Yeah, he supplied
to smaller dealers
up and down the coast.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.326
They called him
"The Chemist."

31:59.380 --> 32:00.916
For what it's worth,

32:00.920 --> 32:03.707
you're the best man
I've ever known.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.035
Compared to what?

32:07.790 --> 32:08.825
Him?

32:19.380 --> 32:21.280
We got to get them
off the North Star.

32:21.290 --> 32:22.996
And back into that water.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.280
You ready for a fight?

32:30.170 --> 32:31.319
Aw, hell, no.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.452
I'm just messing
with you, man.

32:36.460 --> 32:38.075
I'm down
for whatever it takes.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.036
We can stop
hiding up in here.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.200
Right.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.787
Called Jerry.
Gave him the day off.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.320
We have five minutes.

32:51.330 --> 32:52.319
For what?

32:52.330 --> 32:53.615
This is
the footage I took

32:53.620 --> 32:55.417
_ of Kle_sco's _
sonic mapping deVIce.

32:55.420 --> 32:58.378
-[boom]
-Now, if we wanted
to do something,

32:58.380 --> 33:00.325
we'd have five minutes
to get close enough

33:00.330 --> 33:02.070
to screw up
that sonic cannon.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.116
You've heard of Sea First.

33:05.290 --> 33:07.246
Environmental activists.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.242
Yeah,
more like eco-terrorists.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.115
Nobody thought
we were big enough

33:12.120 --> 33:13.872
to make an impact
in the fishing industry.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.281
But then we rammed one big,
bad-boy ship and, bam,

33:17.290 --> 33:19.667
the world saw that footage
of us crashing into that ship,

33:19.670 --> 33:21.911
and people sat up
and paid attention.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.241
I'm telling you,
it was like the shot
heard 'round the world.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.740
The next thing you know,

33:25.750 --> 33:27.286
drift nets were
actually banned.

33:27.290 --> 33:28.917
Ever hear
of David and Goliath?

33:28.920 --> 33:31.036
"Little hits big" can be
surprisingly effective

33:31.040 --> 33:32.667
-when it comes to perception.
-[click]

33:32.670 --> 33:35.161
They stopped the use
of drift nets in the industry,

33:35.170 --> 33:38.162
forced them to modify
their practices forever.

33:38.170 --> 33:39.410
What are you trying
to tell me?

33:39.420 --> 33:41.069
That ship out
on the horizon?

33:42.420 --> 33:44.115
It's just the first one.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.496
There's
a bigger ship coming.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.321
A drill ship,
then a rig and a pipeline.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.109
So I'm saying

33:51.120 --> 33:53.827
that if we wanted
to make a statement now,

33:53.830 --> 33:56.242
we'd have five minutes.

33:56.250 --> 33:59.162
That's how much time there is
between noise blasts.

33:59.170 --> 34:02.662
The amount time we would
have to make an Impact
on Klesco Oil.

34:03.670 --> 34:05.206
I know this sounds crazy.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.245
No.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.575
Ryn broke the law
to save my life.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.108
I'm ready to do something.

34:16.460 --> 34:17.745
Okay.

34:19.170 --> 34:20.239
Let's make some noise.

34:21.330 --> 34:23.878
[police radio chatter]

34:31.540 --> 34:33.201
[line ringing]

34:34.250 --> 34:35.569
[cell phone buzzing]

34:38.790 --> 34:40.200
Marissa, what's up?

34:40.210 --> 34:42.280
Some poor idiot
at the Siren Song Motel

34:42.290 --> 34:45.373
decided to take a shower
while speeding on coke.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.166
Slipped,
broke his neck, and died.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.489
Why call me?

34:48.500 --> 34:49.785
I wanted to give you
a heads up.

34:49.790 --> 34:52.873
_ Initial recon
tIes thIs guy to Susan.

34:54.380 --> 34:56.280
What sort of ties
are we talkIng about?

34:56.290 --> 34:58.872
Word has it they were living
together in Port Angeles.

34:58.880 --> 35:02.281
I didn't want it to wind up
in the local papers
without you knowing.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.160
Who was this guy?

35:05.170 --> 35:07.240
Name's Glen Jenkins.

35:10.620 --> 35:12.702
This guy was trafficking

35:12.710 --> 35:15.372
_ a shit ton
of Illegal substances.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.245
Hmm.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.956
Hmm? Hmm what?

35:18.960 --> 35:20.951
[Dale] How many open cases
do we have

35:20.960 --> 35:22.370
with local drug trafficking?

35:22.380 --> 35:24.200
They ain't getting
here by themselves.

35:24.210 --> 35:25.746
You're thinking...

35:25.750 --> 35:28.378
I think that our missing link
just raised its ugly head.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.870
[Marissa]
Almost snapped it off.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.075
I got a hunch.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.957
About what?

35:33.960 --> 35:36.167
[Dale] Before I was laid off,
I was trying to find

35:36.170 --> 35:39.242
this big supplier
they called, um, The Chemist.

35:39.250 --> 35:41.161
Maybe that's
who your dead guy is.

35:41.170 --> 35:42.660
Might have something to do
with Donnie's homicide.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.570
I can't be sure.

35:44.580 --> 35:46.787
Maybe I'll take another look
at that file.

35:46.790 --> 35:47.870
Check it out.

35:50.620 --> 35:51.609
[beep]

35:59.380 --> 36:01.416
[Donna screaming]

36:01.420 --> 36:04.662
[screaming]

36:07.080 --> 36:09.412
[screaming]

36:09.420 --> 36:11.911
[screaming]

36:11.920 --> 36:15.242
[Donna screaming]

36:16.670 --> 36:20.288
Is my fault.
I lose them to her.

36:20.290 --> 36:22.872
Ben says she beat Levi
near to death

36:22.880 --> 36:25.667
because he
wouldn't go with her
of his own free will.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.661
You didn't lose them.

36:27.670 --> 36:29.240
She took them.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.326
Bad if she is leader.

36:36.330 --> 36:38.321
Danger for all.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.663
She will fight to have
what she wants.

36:41.670 --> 36:42.955
Or she dies.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.373
But you both want
the same thing,

36:46.380 --> 36:48.746
just to be able
to go back into the water.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.287
But is different.

36:51.290 --> 36:55.454
She can
only see us and humans.

36:55.460 --> 36:56.779
Not together.

36:58.670 --> 36:59.910
Like Donna.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.996
I go to sister's grave.

37:07.670 --> 37:11.379
To think before I fight.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.957
[footsteps]

37:27.960 --> 37:29.279
[hisses]

37:30.290 --> 37:31.416
[hisses]

37:37.790 --> 37:39.576
Ryn alone.

37:39.580 --> 37:40.740
Weak.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.376
I take you.

37:46.710 --> 37:47.950
[soft hiss]

37:53.620 --> 37:55.576
You must be hungry.
There's leftover chicken.

37:55.580 --> 37:57.286
I can always whip
something up for lunch.

37:58.790 --> 37:59.916
I'm not hungry.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.996
You know, the situation you put
Maddie in last night was...

38:12.580 --> 38:15.037
I'm not saying you're
the only one to blame
for what happened.

38:16.580 --> 38:17.740
We both put her there.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.450
It's my fault
for believing you were well.

38:25.790 --> 38:26.779
That you would...

38:28.540 --> 38:29.746
ever be well.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.417
I should've never
let you come back.

38:36.250 --> 38:38.616
I should've never let you
anywhere near Maddie.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.417
-Dale, I am sorry.
-Please, please.

38:40.420 --> 38:44.163
Don't start making
promises we both know
you can't keep.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.281
Listen, if you want
to stay in Bristol Cove,

38:59.790 --> 39:01.610
you're gonna have to find
another place to live.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.535
[hisses]

39:24.540 --> 39:26.451
[hisses]

39:26.460 --> 39:27.449
[hisses]

39:38.540 --> 39:40.576
_[Ryn]
My SIster. Here.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.116
Under dirt.

39:42.120 --> 39:46.614
Your mother.
She die because we fight.

39:46.620 --> 39:47.609
[hisses]

39:47.620 --> 39:49.281
This is hallowed ground.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.531
These are our people.

39:51.540 --> 39:52.529
[hisses]

39:53.620 --> 39:55.781
We all want
to go back to water.

39:55.790 --> 39:58.577
All want the same thing.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.241
Home.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.821
But we cannot do it
without humans.

40:02.830 --> 40:05.492
Humans. No good.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.070
They kill us.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.115
Oh, yeah,
well, you kill, too!

40:08.120 --> 40:09.109
[Ben] Xander, no!

40:09.120 --> 40:10.872
Yes.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.495
We kill humans, too.

40:13.540 --> 40:16.111
But this stops now.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.246
Humans weak.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.912
No, you're wrong.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.037
We know why you're angry.
We're angry, too.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.996
See, we want
to protect the ocean,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.707
but we are done begging.

40:29.710 --> 40:31.280
We're ready to fight.

40:31.290 --> 40:33.246
Together. With you.

40:35.250 --> 40:36.535
We need each other.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.110
To take back water.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.320
-[seagulls calling]
-[man] Take it up!

41:13.750 --> 41:15.706
[man 2]
All right, takin' it up!

41:18.170 --> 41:19.614
I got it!

41:19.620 --> 41:20.700
[man] Bring her in!

41:20.710 --> 41:23.326
Hold! Hold it!

41:23.330 --> 41:25.491
What the hell is that?!

41:31.170 --> 41:32.740
[high-pitched call]

41:37.080 --> 41:39.571
[music playing]
