02:37.680 --> 02:39.432
Joshua!

02:42.800 --> 02:44.756
Joshua!

02:53.360 --> 02:55.316
Boy!

02:56.520 --> 02:59.512
You're gonna make this some sad night.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.313
I'm gonna get you.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.597
- Shh!
- Eli?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.677
He's getting close.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.716
He's drunk again, isn't he?

03:33.800 --> 03:37.952
- He's gonna beat me again.
- Not if I can help it.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.519
Argh!

03:39.600 --> 03:41.272
- Let's go!
- Go!

03:41.360 --> 03:43.954
I ain't gonna leave you.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.349
I'm the only one who can handle him.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.508
- All right. But stay right behind me.
- OK.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.156
OK.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.032
Why, Papa?

04:10.160 --> 04:12.879
Why'd you have to go hurt my brother?

04:12.960 --> 04:15.269
Family is sacred, Papa.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.000
You know I'd never hurt you.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.636
Not even for this.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.075
Hey, you took it.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.359
Ah! Stupid kid.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.271
Argh!

05:29.520 --> 05:33.798
Watch
over this as you would watch over me.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.117
Eli, you said you'd be right behind me.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.472
Where is he?

05:46.560 --> 05:49.836
Let's go. He can do what he wants to me.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.876
But he's not hurting you, OK?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.235
We've just got to stay together, right?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.595
Right. Come on. Let's go.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.709
These boys will be
in your care until the adoption.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.552
They've had it rough.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.634
It may take a while for them
to get used to their new surroundings.

06:25.720 --> 06:29.315
'The 6:18 from Lincoln, Nebraska,
now arriving at Gate 10.'

06:29.400 --> 06:31.675
- They've never seen...
- A city.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.671
I know you know. You're nervous.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.320
- But listen to me...
- That's them.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.868
I'll get them. Stay calm.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.832
Mm.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.590
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.592
- You're too young to have a teenage son.
- Stop it.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.956
William and Amanda, meet your new boys.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.919
Hi, Eli. Josh.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.832
- Welcome to Chicago.
- We're really glad you're here.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.796
'692.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.834
'White male. 45 years. About 180lbs. '

07:30.920 --> 07:33.878
'Welcome.
Would you like to make a call?

07:33.960 --> 07:35.951
'Hang up and try again. '

08:04.560 --> 08:06.516
Well, this is it.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.077
Home, sweet home.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.479
You ready?

08:18.840 --> 08:20.796
Whoa, this is great.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.836
Bigger than our trailer, huh, Eli?

08:22.920 --> 08:25.309
You have nice things, Mrs Porter.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.110
Let's go upstairs. I'll show you your room.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.952
All right.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.950
This way.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.354
We got kids in the house.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.956
And this is our room.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.828
If you need anything,
we're just down the hall.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.309
All we ask is that you knock
before you come in.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.439
Joshua! Please, could you put that down?

08:55.520 --> 08:57.670
Uh, it's very, very expensive.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.399
You have a very nice house, Mr Porter.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.232
Thank you, Eli.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.154
You don't have to call us
Mr and Mrs Porter, OK?

09:13.680 --> 09:17.593
Josh, I told you not to pick this up.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.276
Bill. It's just a piece of glass, OK?

09:25.200 --> 09:28.476
Come on. Let's all eat. Come on.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.272
Come on.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.676
We've got a brand-new Japanese invention.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.512
We call it... pizza.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.591
Thank you, John. Sit down now.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.433
Do you want me
to help you cut it?

09:49.520 --> 09:52.159
For godsakes, Amanda. You don't cut pizza.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.196
You just pick it up.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.192
And you fold it and jam it in.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.232
Grace?

10:02.320 --> 10:05.710
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.913
Would you like to do the honours?

10:12.560 --> 10:16.189
Let us give thanks to
He Who Walks Behind the Rows,

10:16.280 --> 10:18.430
who protects our crops

10:18.520 --> 10:23.878
and keeps the infidel and unbeliever
in the torments of hellfire eternal.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.396
- Amen.
- Amen.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.310
Well, that's a real toe-tapper.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.356
Uh, pizza?

10:36.880 --> 10:39.519
I'll show you guys
your new backyard.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.556
This is Amanda's Garden of Eden.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.552
She's got quite a green thumb, actually.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.915
The social worker said you grew corn.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.514
She did? No, no corn.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.235
Oh, I know! I sell corn.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.595
I'm a commodities trader on the exchange.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.516
What's on the other side?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.194
Just an old abandoned factory. It's not safe.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.236
That's why we built this fence.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.428
I don't want you and Joshua
playing over there.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.876
Where is your brother?

11:41.760 --> 11:44.399
She wants to take him but she can't.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.436
- Hah!
- Malcolm!

11:47.520 --> 11:49.795
And he goes for the basket!

11:54.120 --> 11:56.714
Hi. Um, I just moved in next door.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.792
What's with the, uh, clothes?

11:59.880 --> 12:02.474
Is that the new, uh, Amish wear?

12:03.920 --> 12:08.391
What's with your hat? Why is it...
Why is it turned backwards?

12:08.480 --> 12:09.959
Joshua?

12:13.120 --> 12:14.917
Could you come home, please?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.195
Thanks.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.395
It was going to be a surprise.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.516
You have to be more careful.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.593
- You can't walk up to strangers...
- William! William!

12:46.600 --> 12:49.558
I opened the suitcase
and there's bugs in there.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.392
What?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.232
Open it up.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.872
Bugs, Amanda?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.678
I just thought I'd bring a taste of home.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.356
That's nice-looking corn.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.590
Hm.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.718
I'm uncomfortable.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.552
We're not exactly alone anymore.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.598
- They'll get used to it.
- You think?

13:50.680 --> 13:52.636
Mm-hm. Don't worry about it.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.711
We'll get the hang of this.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.109
Besides, Eli is a gem.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.590
And Joshua, well,
he'll probably need a little discipline.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.877
But then again, so will you.

14:09.240 --> 14:13.518
You're not doing this until we take
one last look at those kids.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.999
Yeah. No.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.476
Shh! Be quiet!

14:29.720 --> 14:32.359
They probably always slept in the same bed.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.034
We'll leave them be for now.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.872
OK.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.031
What I was saying is,
I screwed it up already.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.749
First he got mad at me
for breaking his glass thing

15:00.840 --> 15:02.796
and then for talking to strangers.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.430
At least we've got each other.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.273
- Yeah.
- Goodnight.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.911
Corn!

16:33.000 --> 16:36.436
Corn! Corn!

16:54.680 --> 16:59.310
I offer this
to He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.438
Come on, David,
we know I deserve promotion.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.159
Besides, I got two more mouths to feed.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.232
Is that why you decided to, uh, adopt?

18:14.320 --> 18:16.914
Seriously, I mean,
who closed the Agritech deal?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.549
Who sold the surplus corn in Iowa
that nobody wanted? Me.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.392
That deserves some recognition.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.790
William. Too damned impatient.
It'll get you in trouble.

18:25.880 --> 18:29.919
Now, relax, enjoy your new family.
The market's not going anywhere.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.788
The market might not be, but I am.
Remember that.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.552
I'll think about it.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.799
These fit fine. What do you think?

18:44.880 --> 18:48.873
How about this? I like this on you.
It's a good colour.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.918
I'll get scissors and cut the tag off, OK?

19:04.120 --> 19:05.872
Well?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.835
Give us your blood.
Give us your blood.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.274
Uh, Eli, you left your suitcase...

19:24.640 --> 19:28.952
I... take it you boys didn't like
the clothes I bought you.

19:29.040 --> 19:33.716
No offence, ma'am, but modest dress
is the surest way to a pious life.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.475
I'm sure not every kid at school
can afford such clothing.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.233
Why should we make them feel inadequate?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.909
OK.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.429
Excuse me. Where is the principal's office?

19:58.520 --> 20:00.829
Just down the hall on the left.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.070
- Second door.
- Thank you.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.912
This way.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.675
- Mrs Porter.
- Amanda Porter.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.797
- I'm Father Frank Nolan. Principal.
- Nice meeting you.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.838
- These must be your boys.
- That's right.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.434
- Joshua.
- Hm, close. Eli.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.272
Uh, Joshua.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.828
Like the shirt. I, um...

20:31.640 --> 20:34.074
I'll show you to your home rooms.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.116
- This... this way.
- Thank you.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.120
Good morning, class.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.912
All right.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.629
Joshua, you'll be here, room 101.
It's mine, by the way.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.631
And Eli? Let's see.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.551
112.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.279
You're splitting us up?

20:53.360 --> 20:55.351
You are both in different grades.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.590
Where Eli and me come from...

20:57.680 --> 20:59.955
I know you're used to being together...

21:00.040 --> 21:01.792
No!

21:04.880 --> 21:07.633
- Can I see you outside?
- Of course.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.472
We'll be right outside.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.870
Excuse us. Take good care of them.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.073
Hi.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.994
Hey, yeah? Hello there to you.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.633
- I wouldn't sit there.
- Why not?

21:35.920 --> 21:38.878
Cos I think you're gonna try to suck my dick.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.192
Hey.

21:44.280 --> 21:48.034
- You got cow shit in your ears?
- Hey!

21:48.120 --> 21:50.839
Hey!

21:50.920 --> 21:53.229
- All right.
- You wanna touch this?

21:53.320 --> 21:57.074
Oh, T-Loc. You're so bad.
What are you gonna do?

21:57.160 --> 22:00.277
- Cut an Amish kid?
- I'll cut you, bitch.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.432
Who you calling a bitch, punk?
That's my sister.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.909
I'll kick your ass, talkin' like that.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.594
- Well, come on!
- Hey! Back off.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.468
What's up, man? Come on, bring it on.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.312
Nolan's coming back!

22:18.800 --> 22:20.597
Eli, I'm sorry.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.956
You'll be able to see each other at recess.

22:33.640 --> 22:37.394
Come on, man! Come on!

22:37.480 --> 22:39.232
Come on, come on.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.916
What are you getting up for?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.468
It's... it's what you're supposed to do.

23:01.560 --> 23:05.519
When a lady's present?
Jesus. You are from out of town.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.312
Waiting for your brother?

23:15.720 --> 23:20.475
Look. What you did this morning.
It was cool.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.312
But really stupid.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.316
Don't start up with T-Loc.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.112
He shouldn't start with Eli.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.950
Come on! Go!

23:33.160 --> 23:34.912
Do you play?

23:35.960 --> 23:37.712
A bit.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.189
- Hey, Mummy-head!
- What?

23:40.280 --> 23:41.872
Put the Amish kid in.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.999
- What for?
- Cos I say.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.389
No, man. He can't play.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.232
Let him play, man.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.674
Hey, man. You got game?

24:00.760 --> 24:02.796
A little.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.632
All right.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.836
All right!

24:13.560 --> 24:16.632
Whoo!
Whoo! That's "a little"?

24:18.680 --> 24:20.989
All right, all right! Come on!

24:22.280 --> 24:24.999
Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah! Whoo!

24:25.520 --> 24:29.479
We do handshakes out here
when you do things good, all right?

24:29.560 --> 24:32.028
Really, quick - bam... bam... bam.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.076
Not too hard, not too hard.

24:34.160 --> 24:36.116
All right!

24:49.440 --> 24:52.079
- Oh, yeah! All right!
- Whoo!

24:52.160 --> 24:54.435
- Good job, man.
- Nice shot.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.478
- That was beautiful. Good passin'.
- Man! Thanks.

25:02.040 --> 25:05.715
I'm sorry, man. I gotta go. Yeah?

25:15.680 --> 25:19.275
First you leave me,
then you start playing their games.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.316
Oh! I was just having fun.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.039
I had no choice about leaving you anyway.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.032
You said we'd stay together no matter what.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.954
- You know we will.
- Then don't play their games.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.832
Please.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.798
The wilderness shall be glad

26:06.880 --> 26:08.711
and the desert shall bloom.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.759
For He Who Walks Behind the Rows
and all of his children.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.354
We are the selected.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.353
We will flourish on the land, in the homes,

26:19.440 --> 26:21.192
in the hallways and classrooms,

26:21.280 --> 26:23.032
the playgrounds,

26:23.120 --> 26:26.351
until the unbelievers feel our wrath, our fury,

26:26.440 --> 26:29.876
as we triumph over them,
scorching the earth from within.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.110
We are the seed.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.397
And now it's our time to grow.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.915
For if the infidel and unbeliever
shall pass over it...

26:44.520 --> 26:48.115
...they shall be consumed...

26:51.480 --> 26:54.597
Bless my harvest to come!

27:08.120 --> 27:11.874
What the hell? What?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.712
What's going on here?

27:54.120 --> 27:56.588
Jesus Christ!

28:14.480 --> 28:16.232
Ow!

28:51.920 --> 28:53.717
Argh!

28:59.840 --> 29:02.559
Hallelujah!

29:07.680 --> 29:11.958
- Why won't you listen?
- I won't argue about a corn patch.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.679
If you don't cut it down, I will.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.716
Amanda, for godsakes, it's his hobby.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.750
This is crazy.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.751
All right.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.389
I will look at it tomorrow.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.232
Thank you.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.672
Jesus!

30:11.200 --> 30:13.031
Hello?

30:16.040 --> 30:17.792
Hello?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.516
Boo!

30:22.600 --> 30:26.388
- Gotcha, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.391
- Come to harvest?
- No.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.916
- But by the look of it, I could!
- Yeah.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.275
- Want to try some?
- Sure.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.112
OK.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.277
- Smells sweet.
- Yeah.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.792
Eli!

30:52.880 --> 30:55.030
Where did you get this?

30:55.120 --> 30:58.351
My papa, God rest his soul.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.797
He developed the strain.
Guess you could say I sort of helped.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.791
These are his only samples.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.475
I brought them from Gatlin
to see if they'd grow here.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.915
Well, they grow, all right. My God!

31:12.000 --> 31:14.719
I mean, it's not even planting season!

31:16.360 --> 31:18.191
And this is horrible soil.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.909
And there's no blemishes, no bugs.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.199
Eli, you grew this in only four weeks?

31:28.400 --> 31:33.190
Do you have any idea how much
a strain like this could be worth?

31:33.280 --> 31:36.477
Well, like my pa always said,

31:36.560 --> 31:38.630
"You reap what you sow. "

32:02.120 --> 32:05.192
Smells good.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.037
Bye now.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.917
Hah! OK!

32:41.000 --> 32:44.310
Hey, how come your brother never joins us?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.871
Excuse me, guys.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.996
What did you say that for?

32:58.040 --> 33:01.032
Hey, Eli. Why don't you come join us?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.912
Why don't you join me?

33:05.000 --> 33:08.993
Or would you rather eat with... with that?

33:11.640 --> 33:14.757
"That", Eli, is a friend. All right?

33:14.840 --> 33:17.559
It wouldn't hurt you
to make a couple, you know.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.515
Maybe I will.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.475
My sermon today is from Genesis 37.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.594
Joseph dreamed a dream

34:56.679 --> 34:58.955
and he told it to his brethren

34:59.040 --> 35:01.235
and they hated him for it.

35:01.320 --> 35:05.711
So much so that they sold
their own brother into slavery

35:05.800 --> 35:09.713
and told their father he was dead.

35:11.720 --> 35:14.792
Now, Joseph had seen a vision of the truth.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.632
Joshua.
Shh.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.551
You were right.
Quiet.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.437
Joshua!

35:20.520 --> 35:22.511
...shall often meet with defiance

35:22.600 --> 35:25.717
from the ignorant and the wicked.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.712
- I do need to make friends.
- Shh.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.791
Eli Porter!

35:35.360 --> 35:37.396
Does my sermon bore you?

35:37.480 --> 35:40.836
Yes, Father.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.229
If you feel you could do better,

35:43.320 --> 35:49.077
would you like to come forward
and share your thoughts with us?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.752
Thank you, Father.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.112
Who was Joseph?

35:58.200 --> 36:00.191
Who in hell cares?

36:00.280 --> 36:03.272
I do.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.672
And so should you.

36:07.680 --> 36:11.275
Cos he was a child, just like us.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.557
A child with a great vision of the world.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.313
For Joseph loved the land

36:17.400 --> 36:19.356
and provided food for our bellies,

36:19.440 --> 36:21.431
timber for our shelters,

36:21.520 --> 36:24.478
oceans to play in and air to sustain us.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.118
Eli!

36:26.200 --> 36:30.159
But he foresaw that group who
wants to desecrate our Mother Earth,

36:30.240 --> 36:34.677
poison our food with pesticides
and cut down our forests just like grass...

36:34.760 --> 36:35.715
Eli!

36:35.800 --> 36:39.679
...choke the air with pollution
and cloud our water with sewage.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.112
And who is this group?

36:44.600 --> 36:47.034
His brothers.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.714
His adult brothers.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.918
And Joseph was not about
to let that happen!

36:54.000 --> 36:55.877
And neither should you!

36:55.960 --> 36:57.712
Enough!

36:59.080 --> 37:00.832
Enough.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.912
Go to my office. Now.

37:23.960 --> 37:27.350
When you're ready to apologise,
I'll be in my classroom.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.317
Didn't you like the sermon?

37:31.400 --> 37:35.359
I have no interest in anything
you have to say right now.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.072
It comes with the soup.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.195
You never told me your bro was a preacher.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.238
Yeah. He says he gets it from his daddy.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.276
You mean... your daddy.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.430
No. His.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.479
Oh. I'm sorry. I thought I told you.
He's my adopted brother.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.558
Mrs Porter, Samantha Gordon
from Social Services.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.996
I was going through some old files.
I found one on Gatlin.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.832
This concerns Eli.

38:10.920 --> 38:15.198
Could you give me a call
as soon as you get this? Thanks.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.635
Hello? Hello?

39:15.560 --> 39:17.835
Oh, shit!

39:17.920 --> 39:21.799
Spending my tax dollars
for the city's goddamn lights.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.030
At least they could... Goddammit!

39:24.120 --> 39:25.872
Shit. Where did it go?

39:28.040 --> 39:30.998
Looking for this?

39:41.320 --> 39:45.438
'You have reached the emergency number
of the Chicago Police Department.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.796
'Please hold...
A path will be forced for the holy.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.838
'The unbeliever
shall be expected to wait. '

40:15.320 --> 40:17.959
All right. You guys have a great day.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.031
- OK. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.872
Don't I get a kiss?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.637
Sure. Of course you do.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.275
Bye, Mom.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.589
'Mr Porter, your wife is on line one. '

40:52.680 --> 40:55.319
- I'm in a meeting.
- 'Lt's important. '

40:55.400 --> 40:57.152
Then tell her I'm out.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.630
Feel the texture.
It's tough, almost like fabric.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.915
It's not porous at all.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.956
It's almost impossible to penetrate.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.632
That son of a bitch.

41:26.400 --> 41:30.473
If William's not gonna do this,
I'll cut it down myself.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.915
Well, I've got some good news.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.309
I'm actually passing some of you.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.152
Not you, Jenkins.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.231
You'll never pass.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.949
I'll have you next year
and probably the year after that.

41:43.040 --> 41:47.079
You can't even say what
the longest river is in the United States.

41:47.160 --> 41:51.438
- Where did it come from?
- Come on, Charles. You know better.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.715
Think of it.

41:53.800 --> 41:57.076
A strain with an immunity
to bugs and pesticide

41:57.160 --> 42:00.152
and four weeks, planting
to harvest, regardless of soil.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.878
You're holding a fortune
in your hands, Charles.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.516
Why bring me in on this -
something this big?

42:14.600 --> 42:17.558
Why should I share this with my employers?

42:17.640 --> 42:19.392
I developed the strain.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.119
Yes, I know, but ethically you're still bound...

42:22.200 --> 42:23.952
Fuck ethics!

42:24.040 --> 42:26.190
My, my, my, William.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.556
I believe that's the first time
I've heard you swear.

42:29.640 --> 42:33.474
Remember, there are only
two major mountain chains in the US.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.352
Argh!

42:47.440 --> 42:49.351
Sh...!

43:20.800 --> 43:22.358
William!

43:22.440 --> 43:24.476
Charles, I need an investor,

43:24.560 --> 43:27.757
and, believe me, I can go to other people.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.719
Do I meet with your board or not?

44:16.280 --> 44:18.111
Excuse me.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.909
- Yes, Eli.
- Can I get a drink of water?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.798
Go ahead.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.396
- So sorry.
- Thanks, Frank.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.869
What a tragedy.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.315
Call us if you need anything.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.356
Thank you.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.358
Oh, my God!

45:50.400 --> 45:52.277
No!

46:20.360 --> 46:22.316
Good morning.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.152
Hello, James.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.515
Hi.

46:27.880 --> 46:29.632
Hello, Jonathan.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.232
Danielle.

46:34.520 --> 46:35.475
Mary.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.755
Good morning.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.671
I told the Monsignor

46:42.760 --> 46:47.038
that I felt a complete reassessment
of the English program was in order

46:47.120 --> 46:50.749
if we were to instigate
the goals I had in mind.

46:50.840 --> 46:52.796
Seemed to agree, with reservations.

46:52.880 --> 46:55.155
...and burn them in eternal hellfire.

46:55.240 --> 46:59.518
And these frauds, these traitors -
they know who they are.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.312
Excuse me.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.269
Look, Josh,
I know Eli acts a little weird sometimes,

47:14.360 --> 47:18.319
but I've listened to him lately
and what he says makes sense.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.152
Maria, no.

47:20.240 --> 47:24.870
Just stay away from him. Believe me.
You don't know what he's capable of.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.235
Josh, what are you talking about?

47:27.320 --> 47:29.709
Hey! Come on! What's wrong?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.756
Take a look at this.

47:36.680 --> 47:39.319
I found it under his bed this morning.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.960
Oh, Jesus!

47:42.040 --> 47:45.316
I know he's your brother,
but shouldn't you show someone?

47:45.400 --> 47:47.675
William would think I drew it.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.716
Show it to Father Nolan.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.075
- No. I can't.
- Why not?

47:53.800 --> 47:56.234
Because... we're brothers.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.276
- Adopted brothers.
- Maria, look.

47:58.360 --> 48:01.989
Eli and I have been through
a lot together, you know?

48:02.080 --> 48:04.355
We've always looked out for each other -

48:04.440 --> 48:06.192
made each other feel safe.

48:06.280 --> 48:09.078
Well, you feel safe with Malcolm, don't you?

48:10.840 --> 48:12.796
- Yeah.
- And with me?

48:27.520 --> 48:29.590
What... what's wrong?

48:29.680 --> 48:31.830
I've never, uh...

48:31.920 --> 48:33.672
...never really done this before.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.955
It's simple.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.315
That's first base.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.798
That's second base.

49:11.480 --> 49:15.075
So... how do I get a home run?

49:15.160 --> 49:17.355
You don't.

49:24.600 --> 49:27.876
Malcolm! Come on, man.
Me and Maria are just friends.

49:27.960 --> 49:31.635
No, Josh! No, man, no!
She's my sister, OK? No.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.995
I put it to you this way.

49:34.080 --> 49:38.039
I just don't want her getting
involved with a family like yours.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.076
Especially your screwed-up brother.

49:40.160 --> 49:43.118
Eli? What does he have to do with anything?

49:43.200 --> 49:46.829
Come on, Josh! Don't be stupid, man!
Look at this place!

49:46.920 --> 49:50.515
It's deserted! It's supposed
to be packed. School's out.

49:50.600 --> 49:54.513
Let me ask you something.
Who do you think they're with?

49:54.600 --> 49:57.194
I'm outta here, man!

49:57.280 --> 49:59.032
With age comes blindness.

49:59.120 --> 50:04.877
But we who are young,
we are the keepers of a vision of purity.

50:04.960 --> 50:09.556
That is the gift to us from
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

50:09.640 --> 50:14.270
So we may work his will - his will
to cleanse the world of wickedness -

50:14.360 --> 50:16.669
our greatest harvest to come.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.718
Harvest this, motherfucker.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.352
Howdy.

50:24.440 --> 50:28.718
Hey, don't give me that goddamn
Gomer Pyle, howdy-doody bullshit.

50:28.800 --> 50:31.155
We came to get Dee.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.197
Can't spare him.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.271
Well, what you gonna do, man?

50:37.360 --> 50:40.079
Preach me to death?

50:40.160 --> 50:42.390
Try me.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.233
Hey!
Come back here, you little shit.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.072
Come back here!

50:50.920 --> 50:53.639
I'm gonna kick your little ass

50:53.720 --> 50:55.676
Doo-dah, doo-dah

50:57.600 --> 50:59.397
Hey, where you at, butthead?

51:00.920 --> 51:04.833
- Come on! You're in here with me now.
- I'm not in here with you.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.672
You're in here with me.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.718
Oh! Fuck!

51:09.800 --> 51:11.995
Oh, you dead, now. Argh!

51:14.080 --> 51:17.470
Get it off! Get it off of me!

51:17.560 --> 51:21.519
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
Help!

51:21.600 --> 51:24.433
Help me! Help me! Help me!

51:24.520 --> 51:27.432
- Help me!
- I can, you know.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.592
The question is, will you help me?

51:30.680 --> 51:33.319
Yeah, yeah. OK. Get it off of me!

51:33.400 --> 51:35.152
It's got me!

51:35.240 --> 51:38.516
Then let us pray.

51:38.640 --> 51:41.791
I saw an angel
come down from heaven

51:41.880 --> 51:45.839
having the key of the bottomless pit

51:45.920 --> 51:49.310
and a great chain in his hand.

51:50.480 --> 51:53.552
And that concludes my sermon...

51:54.640 --> 51:56.551
...on Revelations.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.993
Does anyone
have any questions?

52:34.600 --> 52:37.512
Look, Frank, you asked me
my opinion as head counsellor,

52:37.600 --> 52:39.556
and I'm giving it to you.

52:39.640 --> 52:43.189
These last few weeks there's been
no smoking in the bathrooms,

52:43.280 --> 52:46.397
no fighting in the hallways,
no drugs, no knives...

52:46.480 --> 52:49.472
Face it, things are finally
shaping up around here.

52:49.560 --> 52:52.597
- Shaping up into what?
- Into something decent.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.910
Are you blind, Frank?
Haven't you noticed?

52:55.000 --> 52:56.956
Things have never been this good.

52:57.040 --> 53:00.715
It was a lie that Noah led the world to rebirth

53:00.800 --> 53:03.394
for had it not been for his children -

53:03.480 --> 53:05.755
his children to fulfil his every wish -

53:05.840 --> 53:08.718
they would have never witnessed
the earth's corruption

53:08.800 --> 53:12.475
and understand that
the old had to be washed away,

53:12.560 --> 53:14.312
one way or another.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.152
Hey, man.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.754
- Hey.
- Look, Josh, uh...

53:19.920 --> 53:21.672
I'm sorry.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.910
No, don't worry about it.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.639
I just wanna say, look, whatever you are,

53:26.720 --> 53:29.553
you are definitely... not him.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.754
I want to ask you something, man,
just out of curiosity.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.831
What happened to his parents?

53:38.960 --> 53:40.712
He said they disappeared.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.031
Yeah. Just like your daddy, huh?
I knew it, man.

53:44.120 --> 53:48.398
They're lost. They're like
bad weeds and need to be taken out.

53:57.120 --> 54:01.432
Joshua, you should be in bed.
This is no time to be going...

54:01.520 --> 54:04.478
Shit.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.836
- Hi.
- Hi yourself.

54:10.920 --> 54:13.150
You're up late.

54:13.240 --> 54:14.992
Working hard?

54:15.080 --> 54:17.833
Just making notes
for a meeting tomorrow morning.

54:17.920 --> 54:21.230
- Idle hands are the devil's tool.
- I've heard that.

54:21.320 --> 54:26.269
Plus it helps me keep my mind off Amanda.

54:26.360 --> 54:29.033
This meeting tomorrow, is it about my corn?

54:29.120 --> 54:33.477
Yes, it is, partner. This could be
exported to people the world over.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.312
Children too?

54:35.400 --> 54:37.595
Especially the children.

54:37.680 --> 54:39.830
You should get to bed.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.593
- OK. Good night.
- Good night.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.795
What happened to his parents?

55:05.880 --> 55:07.632
They, um...

55:08.760 --> 55:10.716
He said they just disappeared.

55:10.800 --> 55:13.837
Yeah. Just like your daddy, huh?

55:23.480 --> 55:25.436
What happened to my father?

55:25.520 --> 55:27.829
Back in Gatlin. What did you do?

55:27.920 --> 55:30.718
Made sure he'd never hurt you again.

55:35.880 --> 55:38.440
Face it, brother,

55:38.520 --> 55:40.875
I'm the only family you've got.

57:03.040 --> 57:04.792
Enough!

57:06.400 --> 57:08.152
I agree.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.669
Package for Amanda Porter.

57:27.760 --> 57:31.435
She's, um... she's not here.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.790
Guess you can sign for it.

57:40.080 --> 57:41.832
Thanks.

57:57.880 --> 58:01.395
Malcolm? Malcolm! Wake up!

58:01.480 --> 58:04.472
Malcolm!

58:04.720 --> 58:07.678
- What the fuck is going on, man?
- Let me in. Now.

58:07.760 --> 58:11.992
- You know what time it is?
- I don't care. Let's go.

58:13.640 --> 58:17.633
Josh, man, if this ain't good, man,
I'm gonna kill you.

58:17.720 --> 58:21.474
It's not good. Get dressed.
Come on. Get dressed. Let's go.

58:21.560 --> 58:24.120
I need thy help now

58:24.200 --> 58:27.510
to end this madness...

58:27.600 --> 58:29.591
and evil.

58:30.640 --> 58:33.438
Oh, do not forsake me now.

58:33.520 --> 58:36.796
When I was 14, Papa and I moved to Gatlin.

58:36.880 --> 58:40.031
The town had a bad history,
so the land was cheap.

58:40.120 --> 58:42.634
Malcolm, Wake up! Listen to me.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.676
So the land was cheap there.

58:44.760 --> 58:48.070
My papa needed a lot of it
to work on his corn experiments.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.151
You woke me up for that?

58:50.240 --> 58:52.196
Help me, Lord.

58:52.280 --> 58:59.197
Give me strength to do battle in thy name
against this... this devil with a child's face.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.794
He haunts my dreams.

59:01.880 --> 59:06.795
At school, I can feel
his evil presence everywhere I go.

59:06.880 --> 59:09.155
Hello, Frank.

59:14.920 --> 59:17.150
1964?

59:17.240 --> 59:19.913
No way, man. This can't be him.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.072
It's him. I know every inch of his face.

59:23.160 --> 59:24.912
Now, check these out.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.834
See, Social Services keeps pretty
detailed records of their orphans.

59:28.920 --> 59:31.559
Each of these clippings is from Gatlin.

59:32.760 --> 59:36.799
Any farm boy can tell you
each of those nights is a harvest moon.

59:36.880 --> 59:39.314
- You ever see one?
- No.

59:39.400 --> 59:42.472
Well, look up in the sky
and you will... tonight.

59:42.560 --> 59:45.711
Right, we've got to see Father Nolan.
Get dressed.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.756
Who the hell are you?

59:47.840 --> 59:49.717
Father...

59:49.800 --> 59:51.756
As if you didn't know.

59:53.280 --> 59:55.271
Why are we seeing Nolan?

59:55.360 --> 59:58.477
I overheard him in the cafeteria.
He might understand.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.355
You knew who I was
from the moment you laid eyes on me.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.318
So did my poor foster mother.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.439
Certain people can do that, Frank.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.476
I don't know why.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.551
To stop you!

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.880
Sure, Frank.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.236
Give it your best shot.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.152
Sorry.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.390
I'll kill you!

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.516
Now let us pray.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.679
- Pray to me, Frank.
- No.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.589
Frank, pray to me.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.636
No!

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.636
All right, then.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.309
What are you doing?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.030
You won't get away with this.
You can't get away with this!

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.036
Father? He's not here.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.112
- Let's try the chapel.
- Chapel, chapel, chapel.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.952
Dear Frank,

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.600
thank you.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.196
Thank you for living just long enough
to see all your work destroyed,

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.475
your students turned against you...

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.516
- I will...
- What?

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.273
What, Frank? Destroy me?

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.316
With what? This?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.868
Your Bible is no match for mine.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.394
Show it to me and we'll see.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.755
Frank, Frank, Frank,

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.799
do you think I'd be stupid
enough to keep it with me?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.478
Why would that be stupid?

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.835
Come on, Malcolm.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.878
Is that where you're vulnerable, Eli?

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.996
It is, isn't it?

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.071
I don't have time for this.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.116
It is!

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.715
It is! It is, it is!

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.716
You can't hide from God!

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.519
Father Nolan!

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.512
Father Nolan! Are you OK?
Father, what's happening?

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.034
Come on, Malcolm. Father?

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.675
No, no! Oh, no!

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.513
Oh, my God!

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.630
Go! Ugh!

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.632
Father?

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.632
Father?

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.598
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.309
Father, what happened?
What's going on, man?

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.119
His Bible.
What?

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.113
- What's he talking about?
- Get it. Destroy it!

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.316
The Bible?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.436
What's he talking about? Whose bible?

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.795
- Father, whose bible?
- Eli... Eli's Bible.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.871
Back in Gatlin. Come on.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.356
Josh?

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.950
Josh!

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.117
Hi there, Maria.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.393
Partnership with Germany is complete.
Congratulations.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.119
Let's have a drink.
Good idea.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.790
It's time for dinner.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.714
Your parents are expecting us.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.236
That's my place.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.269
That's it?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.669
Yep.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.716
Home, sweet home.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.749
I think he put it at the foot of the scarecrow.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.751
Which scarecrow?

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:07.118
You take the one on the right.
I'll take the left.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.310
Mmm! This is excellent, Eli.
So thoughtful of you to bring it.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.073
This is the best I've had this year.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.153
- It's my way of saying thank you.
- For what?

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.879
- Maria didn't tell you?
- Uh-uh.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.394
Go ahead, Maria.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.995
- You're gonna be the first.
- First what?

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.996
Diana? What's up?

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.156
Diana! Are you OK? Oh, God!

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.312
A good beginning.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.396
Don't even think about it.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.359
Hey, Josh! This one's clean!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.356
Josh!

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.752
You're fired.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.149
Oh, my God!

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.519
Papa?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.238
Oh, shit!

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:29.470
Oh, my God! Oh!

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.077
Shit. Argh!

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:38.037
Shit, man! Oh, Josh!
Malcolm!

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.076
Did you find it?

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.991
What, man? What?

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.033
Shit!

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.156
Where's the fucking scarecrow? Oh, man.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.196
Josh, fuck, I'm out of here.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.840
- I'm out!
- Malcolm!

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.232
Shit!

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.515
Josh! No!

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:30.033
Hey, you remember
where we parked the car?

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.032
Oh, shit! The Bible!

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.716
- Shit. I've got it.
- No, man. I'll get it. Watch my back.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.390
Josh!

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.320
Malcolm! What the hell's happening?

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.910
Josh!

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.592
Malcolm!

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.915
- Malcolm, no!
- Argh!

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.235
Malcolm!

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.909
Malcolm! Malcolm!

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.789
This is the night of the harvest moon,

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.553
when the children shall leave their homes

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.712
and all their worldly belongings

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.793
to join together with
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.112
Tonight is the night
when we will purge the old,

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.273
cleanse the earth and purify the harvest.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.229
This cross joins you with
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.834
This cross joins you with
He Who Walks Behind the Rows.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:10.070
Thanks for the ride. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.991
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.152
Bye.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.992
Eli!

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.794
Let us give thanks to
He Who Walks Behind the Rows,

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.668
for the bounty He has bestowed upon us.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.472
And let us pray,

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.189
pray that we shall have
the strength to fulfil his vision,

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.798
strength to slay those who
are corrupted and corrupting.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.590
For we - we, the children -
are the purity of the lamb,

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.277
and the adults, the creatures past
their 19th year, they... they are...

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.759
The beast!

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.069
A time of change is upon us,

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.153
for in this season it will be
the beast that is slaughtered...

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.151
...at the hands of the lamb.

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.432
Eli!

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.953
Oh!

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.311
Oh. Daddy's home.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.358
Whoa! Hey!

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.671
- Papa.
- Eli, what are you doing up there?

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.228
Who are your friends?

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.716
Eli, what is all this?

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.677
The meeting went well?

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.716
- Yeah, my meeting went...
- Good.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.711
You've been working very hard.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.475
And because of you our seeds will spread,

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.312
our churches will grow

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.914
and our harvest shall be mighty indeed.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.831
Well, whatever.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.352
It's time to rest, Papa.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.193
Oh, no, I just got started, then I...

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.078
- Of course.
- Huh?

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.837
Eli!

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.396
Let the harvest begin.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.715
I knew you'd come to me, brother.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.677
I'm not your brother!

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.910
And I came back for you.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.275
I have your weakness, asshole.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.952
Go ahead. Destroy it.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.999
I have to get rid of you
and your Bible at once.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.877
Then come for me.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.633
I wondered, if this Bible was so important,

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.995
why'd you leave it out of reach?

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.755
Then I realised
it's because you're like a worm.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.592
A worm has two halves.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.114
You can kill one, the other lives.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.589
This Bible's your other half, Eli.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.513
Now I'm going to crush you completely.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.789
Give it to me!

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.632
Screw you!

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.358
This part of the worm
doesn't like being hurt.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.992
Yeah.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.116
Come on, Eli!

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.077
Come on, "brother"! Let's go!

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.072
You want your Bible?

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.628
I got it. It's right here.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.472
Come and get it.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.272
Huh! Argh!

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.956
Give it to me, brother!
Give me the book!

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.959
Maria, he killed Malcolm.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.918
Now!

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.355
You really want it? Here!

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.872
Choke on it!

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.918
Argh!

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.272
Maria! Maria!

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.120
It's all right. It's over.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.788
Hey, man.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.836
Oh!

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.592
Shit!

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.113
Hey!

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.279
It's got me! It's all tangled!
Help me, please, someone!

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:15.636
I can't get it off me!

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.678
Come on! Move your legs.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.312
Run!

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.559
Hey! Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.392
Argh! No!

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.477
Argh! No!

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.072
No!

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.192
Maria!

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.555
No!

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.111
Maria!

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.551
Come on!

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:59.391
OK, hurry, we've got to cut the root!

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.275
Come on!

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.032
You OK? Let's go.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.797
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.632
Let's go.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.314
This is just the beginning, Hans.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.039
Soon we'll be shipping all over the world.
