WEBVTT

01:53.083 --> 01:55.166
- Give us this day
our daily bread

01:55.250 --> 01:57.041
and forgive us
our debts,

01:57.125 --> 01:58.875
as we forgive our debtors,
and lead us not...

01:58.958 --> 02:00.625
- Of course, he shouldn't
really be buried

02:00.708 --> 02:02.833
- in consecrated ground.
- Shh.

02:02.916 --> 02:06.375
- Thank you.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.333
Wonderful.

02:10.666 --> 02:13.333
- For Thine is the kingdom
and the power

02:13.416 --> 02:15.375
and the glory forever.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.166
Amen.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.333
- Church said
you had a telegram.

02:33.416 --> 02:35.291
It's from Clay.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.833
Coroner's verdict
on Patrick Morris...

02:37.916 --> 02:39.208
suicide.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.166
- How could he say
anything else?

02:41.250 --> 02:42.875
They'll blame me.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.500
- You were strong.
He was weak.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.166
Who's to blame for that?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.583
- Even so--
- By the way,

02:48.666 --> 02:50.583
- I'm firing Miss Grant.
- Good.

02:50.666 --> 02:52.416
It's about time we treated
Gladys as an adult.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.041
But I'll replace her.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.750
- Then why is she going?
- She's lost control of Gladys.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.500
You know my opinion.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.625
- George, I'm working
to achieve a position

03:01.708 --> 03:03.541
that will alter Gladys' life
for the better.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.625
If you want to help her,
help me.

03:18.833 --> 03:22.750
- The editor's name is
T. Thomas Fortune.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.375
He's asked me
to come by his office

03:24.458 --> 03:26.916
to discuss writing
for "The New York Globe."

03:27.000 --> 03:29.083
Peggy, how exciting!

03:29.166 --> 03:32.000
- Why didn't you say before now?
- I didn't know before now.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.416
I sent him my story,
but I got no answer.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.000
And I suppose I was trying
to break some sort of mold

03:38.083 --> 03:39.625
at "The Advocate."

03:39.708 --> 03:41.333
But Mr. Fortune
is a trailblazer.

03:41.416 --> 03:44.291
- So you could be a published
writer in no time at all.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.875
And you could be a bride,

03:45.958 --> 03:48.291
if you give Mr. Raikes
an answer.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.541
- I still can't believe
he asked the question.

03:50.625 --> 03:53.583
Maybe he didn't.
Maybe I was mistaken.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.750
- Do you hope
you were mistaken?

03:55.833 --> 03:57.791
Not exactly.

03:57.875 --> 04:01.041
Although it still feels
rather rushed.

04:01.125 --> 04:05.250
- What would you say to him
if your aunts didn't exist?

04:05.333 --> 04:07.416
Good point.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.791
Oh, let's go in.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.333
- Why? Do you need anything?
- Not particularly.

04:13.416 --> 04:15.125
- Then let's not.
- Please.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.875
I just can't get over
the shops in New York.

04:16.958 --> 04:19.708
We have nothing like them in
Doylestown, I can assure you.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.875
- How can they have
such a choice

04:28.958 --> 04:30.875
wherever you look?

04:30.958 --> 04:33.083
Oh.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.666
Aren't these heavenly?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.791
Which do you prefer?

04:37.875 --> 04:40.791
That one matches your eyes.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.458
- Mrs. Chamberlain.
How do you do?

04:43.541 --> 04:45.125
Well, as it happens,

04:45.208 --> 04:47.125
I called on Mr. Knoedler
on my way here,

04:47.208 --> 04:50.625
and see what I've
come away with?

04:52.333 --> 04:53.583
- Oh.

04:53.666 --> 04:55.208
- I think it must have been
a jewelry box.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.375
- How perfectly lovely.
- She shouldn't be in here.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.208
- Knoedler says
it's Grinling Gibbons,

04:59.291 --> 05:01.083
which I doubt,
but I don't care either way.

05:01.166 --> 05:04.333
- Mrs. Chamberlain.

05:04.416 --> 05:07.583
Always a pleasure
to welcome you to our store.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.208
Would you like to see?

05:13.458 --> 05:15.083
Whether it's a Gibbons or not,

05:15.166 --> 05:18.291
the man who made this
knew how to carve wood.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.708
- This is Miss Scott.
She's a secretary for my aunt.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.333
- And for you?
- No.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.916
But my aunts don't like
me going out unaccompanied.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.500
- Thank you, ma'am.
It's beautiful.

05:27.583 --> 05:29.333
Now, what brings you in here?

05:29.416 --> 05:31.333
- I need some gloves.
- So do I.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.708
But first I want a shawl.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.250
Do you really think
it's this one?

05:35.333 --> 05:37.208
- Mm, yes.
- Then let me pay for it.

05:37.291 --> 05:38.291
And we'll go together.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.750
Oh, no, it mustn't look

05:39.833 --> 05:41.583
as if we're
on a planned shopping trip.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.250
- I don't--
- No, I mean it.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.791
But I always
enjoy our meetings, Miss Brook.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.583
Let's get out of here.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.083
- Not long.
Just around the block.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.375
Or--or send John.
Pumpkin likes him.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.208
- No, no, Miss Ada.
I'll go.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.916
- I'd take him myself, but
I have a hundred things to do,

06:12.000 --> 06:13.916
and Miss Scott has gone out
with Miss Marian.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.541
- Oh, that's all right,
Miss Ada.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.625
I'd like a stroll.

06:19.375 --> 06:20.625
Bye.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.750
Mr. Fane.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.791
Your office said
you were on your way here,

06:32.875 --> 06:34.000
but I thought
I might miss you.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.666
- Are you a member
of the club?

06:35.750 --> 06:37.416
- Don't worry--
their entry standards

06:37.500 --> 06:39.208
haven't sunk that low.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.416
But I wanted to say,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.916
I'm very sorry
about Patrick Morris,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.791
whatever you may think.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.833
I don't think anything...

06:47.916 --> 06:49.916
beyond that it was a sad end
to what had been

06:50.000 --> 06:51.458
a reasonably decent life.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.125
- You'll say it was my fault.
- No, Mr. Russell.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.916
We behaved badly,
and you punished us,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.583
which was fair enough.

06:57.666 --> 07:00.208
It was a pity that Morris
wasn't equal to the test.

07:00.291 --> 07:02.000
- This is not a game
for weaklings.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.500
No, indeed.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.875
- How are things
progressing now?

07:06.958 --> 07:08.875
- We're ready to pass
the new bill.

07:08.958 --> 07:10.833
It will be announced next week
or the week after.

07:10.916 --> 07:12.000
We'll send word.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.833
- Will you make back
the money you lost?

07:13.916 --> 07:15.666
- The share price
is too high for that,

07:15.750 --> 07:17.166
as you know better than I.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.000
But there's no point
in crying

07:19.083 --> 07:21.625
when you play a game
and lose.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.625
- I bear you no ill will,
Mr. Fane.

07:24.708 --> 07:26.000
- That's not
what it sounded like

07:26.083 --> 07:27.458
when the Aldermen
came to see you.

07:27.541 --> 07:29.000
I was angry then.

07:29.083 --> 07:31.125
I'm not angry now.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.666
Good day.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.666
Mr. Fane.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.416
Would you have time to drop
by my office this afternoon?

07:55.583 --> 07:57.250
Whoa, now.

07:57.333 --> 08:00.333
Easy, now.
Whoa, whoa.

08:00.416 --> 08:02.458
Steady now, girl.

08:02.541 --> 08:04.500
Oh!

08:04.583 --> 08:06.500
Okay.
Slow down, now.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.875
Come on.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.166
- But surely
you must have felt something.

08:13.250 --> 08:16.458
He must have tugged at
his leash before he got loose.

08:16.541 --> 08:18.208
- Well, if he did,
I didn't notice.

08:18.291 --> 08:21.791
- Doesn't he have a brass tag
with the address on his collar?

08:21.875 --> 08:23.958
Oh, yes.

08:24.041 --> 08:25.250
Oh, thank the Lord.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.666
Um, I have it here, ma'am.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.583
- Oh. Well, I'm sure
anyone who lives on the street

08:30.666 --> 08:31.916
will recognize him.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.208
- But what if he's found
by an unscrupulous thief?

08:36.291 --> 08:38.250
Someone might pay $50 for him.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.583
- Only if they do not know
the breed.

08:40.666 --> 08:43.375
- But what would happen
to my poor little Pumpkin,

08:43.458 --> 08:44.708
surrounded by strangers?

08:44.791 --> 08:47.208
- You never know--they might be
very kind to him.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.375
Oh!

08:48.458 --> 08:50.833
- Really, Ada, there's
no point in carrying on

08:50.916 --> 08:52.916
- as if you lived in a tree.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.166
- I've no doubt someone will
bring him back any minute now.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.666
- Don't you agree, Bannister?
- I certainly hope so, ma'am.

08:57.750 --> 09:01.083
- Oh. Oh, I shall
have to lie down.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.583
- You survive a civil war,
yet you collapse

09:05.666 --> 09:07.791
because a lap dog is missing?

09:07.875 --> 09:10.791
Pull yourself together,
for heaven's sake.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.458
You're a soldier's daughter.
Remember it.

09:14.833 --> 09:15.833
Pumpkin.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.583
- Poor Miss Ada,
she does so love that dog.

09:18.666 --> 09:21.083
- Thank you, Miss Armstrong,
I feel bad enough already.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.666
- Should we make up
a search party?

09:22.750 --> 09:23.958
But where would you start?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.416
- Mrs. Van Rhijn says
that everyone on this street

09:26.500 --> 09:27.916
- knows the dog.
- I agree.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.416
Someone will bring it back.
At least they should.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.250
- What people should do
and what they do do

09:32.333 --> 09:34.541
- aren't always the same.
- Quite right.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.041
- Won't you tell me
what I've done wrong?

09:42.125 --> 09:43.125
You've done nothing wrong.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.583
- Well, then come out
with me again.

09:44.666 --> 09:45.666
No.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.875
- You are telling me
that you took Miss Gladys

09:52.958 --> 09:55.125
to a hotel to meet a young man
in broad daylight?

09:55.208 --> 09:58.375
- It wasn't like that.
- What was it like, Miss Grant?

09:58.458 --> 09:59.875
- You only know this
because you've opened

09:59.958 --> 10:01.791
- a letter addressed to me.
- You are a young girl.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.333
And I am your mother,
and I have every right

10:03.416 --> 10:04.791
to know who's corresponding
with you.

10:04.875 --> 10:05.791
I'm not a girl.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.333
I am a woman,
whether it suits you or not.

10:07.416 --> 10:08.625
- Is this the tone
you encourage?

10:08.708 --> 10:09.958
No.

10:10.041 --> 10:13.208
But I don't think
Mr. Baldwin intended any harm.

10:13.291 --> 10:16.000
They're young people.
It was quite innocent.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.541
- By which you mean?
- Gladys is an adult.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.791
She cannot be cooped up
here forever.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.458
- Presumably you speak
in such a manner

10:22.541 --> 10:24.125
because you know
you have lost your position?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.416
Mother.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.208
- Yes. Mrs. Russell,
I'll pack at once.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.041
Thank you, Miss Grant.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.708
I'll have the money for you
when you're ready to leave.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.291
- He will help me to recover
the money I lost.

10:45.375 --> 10:48.083
The money we lost.

10:48.166 --> 10:51.666
- He can do it.
Of that, I'm sure.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.666
- You mean we wouldn't
have to sell the house?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.875
No, I don't believe so.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.666
- Is this remorse
over the death of Patrick?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.333
Does he think you'll put
a gun in your mouth

11:00.416 --> 11:01.541
if you go under?

11:01.625 --> 11:03.041
- He's sorry it happened,
Aurora.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.666
He came to the club
to tell me so.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.833
- But wouldn't he lose
by letting you recover?

11:06.916 --> 11:09.083
- It's a drop
in the ocean to him.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.708
So don't keep me in suspense.

11:11.791 --> 11:13.583
What does he want from you?

11:13.666 --> 11:15.708
He must want something
in return.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.166
All right.

11:21.375 --> 11:24.750
He would like you to bring
his wife into society.

11:24.833 --> 11:28.291
He's tired of her
being excluded.

11:28.375 --> 11:30.208
- She's no more excluded
than any one

11:30.291 --> 11:31.875
of a dozen women
I can think of.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.041
- She just isn't included.
- He's tired of it.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.916
Well, what can I do?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.541
You overestimate my power.

11:41.791 --> 11:44.333
You mean you'd like me to try?

11:44.416 --> 11:47.875
- Since you ask, I'd like
us not to be paupers.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.791
I'd like us not to be dependent
on your father's charity.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.458
I--

11:53.875 --> 11:58.583
I would like us
to be ourselves again.

11:58.666 --> 12:00.625
Very well.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.666
If you insist.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.708
Thank you.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.333
- And mind what you say
about my father.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.333
Don't be too sad.

12:14.416 --> 12:17.416
You've been dying
to get rid of me for years.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.916
- Mother will find
a new governess,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.916
and she may be even worse.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.333
- I may have been
your jailer.

12:23.416 --> 12:25.750
I hope I have also been
your friend.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.250
- If you hadn't stuck up
for me,

12:27.333 --> 12:29.416
you wouldn't have lost
your job.

12:32.791 --> 12:35.041
Look at that poor
little thing.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.625
Do you suppose it's lost?

12:36.708 --> 12:39.791
- Mrs. Bruce,
can you catch it, please?

12:50.458 --> 12:52.000
What's going on?

12:52.083 --> 12:54.125
- We found this poor
little dog in the road.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.166
Looks familiar to me.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.416
- Doesn't it belong to--
- I know whom it belongs to.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.416
- Shall it take it back now?
- Go to your room.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.125
Mrs. Bruce can manage the dog.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.416
Miss Grant.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.625
- I was just leaving,
Mrs. Russell.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.625
Goodbye, Gladys.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.041
Take it downstairs,

13:14.125 --> 13:15.833
give it a bath
and something to eat.

13:15.916 --> 13:17.541
Then come up
to my sitting room.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.375
I'll write a note
for a footman to deliver.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.083
- Wash it and feed it
and tell me when you're done.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.375
Yes, ma'am.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.666
Adalheid.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.708
- What do you think they'll do
now Miss Grant is gone?

13:30.791 --> 13:31.875
I don't know.

13:31.958 --> 13:34.041
- I mean, will Miss Gladys
have a new governess

13:34.125 --> 13:35.750
or a proper lady's maid?

13:35.833 --> 13:38.000
Have you no work to do?

13:58.166 --> 14:00.291
Excuse me?

14:03.958 --> 14:05.291
Excuse me?

14:05.375 --> 14:06.916
- Parker, can you hold
that lever?

14:07.000 --> 14:07.916
I'm not Parker.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.083
- Can you hold
that lever still?

14:09.166 --> 14:10.500
- It's shaking.
- This one?

14:10.583 --> 14:13.041
- Yes, just hold it--
hold it steady.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.041
Oh.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.666
Thank you.

14:27.791 --> 14:30.333
That's an actual newspaper.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.458
- And you helped
to print it,

14:32.541 --> 14:35.416
- Miss...
- Uh, Peggy Scott.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.125
The writer.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.500
Are you early for our meeting,
or am I running behind?

14:40.583 --> 14:43.125
- You're Mr. Fortune?
- I am.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.125
Ah.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.625
- Oh.
- Sorry.

14:47.708 --> 14:49.250
Oh.

14:51.541 --> 14:53.791
Uh...
It's amazing.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.625
- This isn't even
one of the steam presses.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.333
I've been working
these machines

14:57.416 --> 15:00.583
since my days back at
"The Jacksonville Daily Union."

15:00.666 --> 15:03.291
What you do is
set the type backwards,

15:03.375 --> 15:06.208
and it gets reversed
in the press.

15:06.291 --> 15:09.083
- Fascinating.
- So is your writing.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.875
You fashioned a unique
and compelling narrative.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.583
Thank you.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.583
Fortune!

15:15.666 --> 15:18.500
We cannot exhaust
our resources like this

15:18.583 --> 15:19.750
without new subscriptions.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.166
And we can't get new readers

15:21.250 --> 15:23.958
if your editorials
continue to provoke.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.125
Oh, hello.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.375
- This is Peggy Scott,
a new writer.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.666
- George Parker.
- Now, don't worry.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.166
We'll get the subscriptions.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.666
But not by kowtowing
to the Republican Party.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.125
- A lot of colored people
still believe in them.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.000
Remember,
Lincoln was a Republican.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.291
- Which is why we must expose
their shortcomings

15:40.375 --> 15:42.916
and demand more.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.458
Have you ever thought
about writing

15:44.541 --> 15:46.166
anything political,
Miss Scott?

15:46.250 --> 15:47.208
I have.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.500
- Don't ask her
if she's a Republican.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.833
- Well, why should I align
myself with either party

15:51.916 --> 15:53.791
when I don't have
the right to vote?

15:57.041 --> 16:00.166
- I'm publishing the story
you submitted next week.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
And I want you to write
something about that, too.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.125
- About what?
- What you just said--

16:05.208 --> 16:08.041
political affiliation
without voting rights,

16:08.125 --> 16:09.500
200 words.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.833
Good to meet you, Miss Scott.

16:20.250 --> 16:23.208
- It was delivered by a footman
from across the road.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.166
Oh, oh.

16:25.250 --> 16:29.500
- Ada will you stop that noise?
I cannot hear myself think.

16:29.583 --> 16:30.625
See?

16:33.250 --> 16:37.416
- The Russells
have found Aunt Ada's dog.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.541
- Oh.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.416
- What's wrong with that?
- Oh, joy!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.375
- Oh, is it true?

16:42.458 --> 16:43.625
If they'd found the dog,

16:43.708 --> 16:45.916
why not send a footman
to return it?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.250
No, if you ask me,
they kidnapped it

16:48.333 --> 16:50.625
so Mrs. Russell
could deliver it in person.

16:50.708 --> 16:51.750
I said this would happen,

16:51.833 --> 16:53.416
when Oscar brought
her son to tea.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.875
She wants to force us
to receive her.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.833
Mark my words--any minute now,
Mrs. Russell will arrive

16:57.916 --> 17:00.708
with the dog tucked
underneath her arm.

17:00.791 --> 17:01.958
- Why don't I go
and get him?

17:02.041 --> 17:03.708
- No.
- Well, I don't mind.

17:03.791 --> 17:05.625
No!

17:05.708 --> 17:08.000
I will not have that mutt
turned into a link

17:08.083 --> 17:09.291
between these houses.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.000
Bannister,
you go fetch it.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.583
Very good, ma'am.

17:12.666 --> 17:15.000
Pumpkin is not a mutt.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.875
- You'll know
the Russells one day.

17:16.958 --> 17:20.041
- Hmm.
Over my dead body.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.791
- I'm sorry
if you don't like Jack.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.291
I think he's a nice boy.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.666
- He's nice enough
to work with.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.125
- Well, I don't see
much romance in your future

17:36.208 --> 17:38.458
if you won't let
a boy hold your hand.

17:38.541 --> 17:42.083
And I think your own mother
would agree with me.

17:42.166 --> 17:43.958
I know she would.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.208
- Good afternoon,
Mrs. McNeil.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.708
<i>- This is an honor,</i>
<i>Mr. Bannister,</i>

18:07.791 --> 18:09.375
although Mrs. Russell
was planning

18:09.458 --> 18:11.041
to bring back the dog
herself.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.500
- Mrs. Van Rhijn didn't want
to put her to that trouble.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.125
- Still, it's good
of you to come

18:15.208 --> 18:16.416
and not just send a footman.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.833
I wanted to come.

18:17.916 --> 18:20.166
We've spent long enough
watching this house

18:20.250 --> 18:21.958
rise up on the avenue.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.333
I'm curious to see
what it's like.

18:24.416 --> 18:26.166
- Do you have time
for the short tour?

18:26.250 --> 18:28.125
- What about the family?
- They're upstairs changing.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.125
Then as long as it is short.

18:30.208 --> 18:33.291
- Well, this is the kitchen,
as you can see.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.625
Monsieur Baudin's kingdom.

18:35.708 --> 18:39.416
<i>- Monsieur. Je suis</i>
<i>heureaux de vous recontrer.</i>

18:39.500 --> 18:40.458
<i>Ah. Bon jour.</i>

18:40.541 --> 18:41.958
Hmm.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.500
May I?

18:43.583 --> 18:45.458
- Uh,<i> bien sur.</i>
Yeah.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.708
Uh, those are tomorrow's menus.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.208
I write out the final list,

18:49.291 --> 18:51.416
and Madam approves it
before she goes up to dress.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.250
I see.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.000
Heavens!
Chicken soup for luncheon.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.541
That's not something
with which I'm familiar.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.375
- Chicken soup?
- Soup at luncheon.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.708
Or is it chilled?

19:03.791 --> 19:06.166
No. It's hot.

19:06.250 --> 19:09.708
- Well, well,
every day you learn something.

19:09.791 --> 19:11.208
What's this?

19:11.291 --> 19:13.708
- Trifle?
- Don't you like trifle either?

19:13.791 --> 19:14.875
It's not that exactly.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.750
We would think of it
as a nursery dish.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.666
Still, one man's meat
is another man's poison,

19:19.750 --> 19:21.000
as they say.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.541
Can I see upstairs?

19:29.666 --> 19:31.333
- I'll be out of your way
in a minute.

19:31.416 --> 19:34.416
- There's no hurry.
Wait till they come down.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.833
How was your meeting?

19:36.916 --> 19:38.791
Exhilarating and, uh...

19:38.875 --> 19:41.041
Rather unexpected.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.083
Well?

19:43.166 --> 19:44.541
He's publishing my story,

19:44.625 --> 19:46.458
and he wants me
to write an article.

19:46.541 --> 19:48.083
- Hurrah!

19:48.166 --> 19:50.708
- The pay isn't much.
- But it's your dream.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.541
This is wonderful news.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.541
- May I know
this wonderful news?

19:54.625 --> 19:55.958
You'll be thrilled.

19:56.041 --> 19:58.208
- I haven't been thrilled
since 1865.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.583
- A Mr. Fortune, the editor
of "The New York Globe,"

20:00.666 --> 20:02.750
is going to publish
one of my stories--

20:02.833 --> 20:05.041
- "Alone in the City."

20:05.125 --> 20:07.166
What's it about?

20:07.250 --> 20:10.083
- A young colored woman
living on the Upper East Side.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.791
- It's about you,
in other words.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.583
- All writers write
about themselves,

20:13.666 --> 20:14.916
at least at the start.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.125
But Mr. Fortune wants
my next article

20:17.208 --> 20:18.625
to be more political.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.458
- Just make sure
that if you do,

20:20.541 --> 20:22.458
I never find out.

20:22.541 --> 20:24.416
- Mr. Fortune sounds
an improvement

20:24.500 --> 20:26.291
on Mr. Carlton
at "The Advocate."

20:27.416 --> 20:29.208
- When will you tell
your parents?

20:29.291 --> 20:30.708
- With Mrs. Van Rhijn's
permission,

20:30.791 --> 20:31.916
I mean to go on Friday.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.666
- Of course you have
my permission.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.416
You'll make them very proud.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.833
But only tell them
about the story.

20:37.916 --> 20:40.416
They won't want trouble
any more than I do.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.666
My goodness.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.291
How splendid.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.666
I have been transported
to Versailles.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.916
- Are there surprises
here, too?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.291
- No, no.
Nothing important.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.625
Please, I'd like to hear.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.000
Oh.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.625
I would not lay
the fruit knife and fork.

21:24.708 --> 21:26.416
They arrive
with the fruit plate

21:26.500 --> 21:28.875
and the finger bowl.

21:28.958 --> 21:33.208
The pudding spoon and fork
would not be above the place,

21:33.291 --> 21:34.791
but here.

21:36.625 --> 21:40.041
What is this?
It seems to have got lost.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.500
- It's an oyster fork.
It sits on its own spoon.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.166
Does it indeed?

21:44.250 --> 21:45.916
Fancy that.
Hmm.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.208
And colored glasses--
how festive.

21:49.291 --> 21:50.541
- Do you not use
colored glasses?

21:50.625 --> 21:51.875
No.

21:51.958 --> 21:56.250
A-and we set them in a square,
the English way, not in a line.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.875
I wonder they don't
find themselves

21:57.958 --> 22:00.208
drinking their neighbor's wine.

22:00.291 --> 22:01.666
- Oh.
- But, of course,

22:01.750 --> 22:04.125
there's no right or wrong
about these things.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.583
They're simply
a matter of taste.

22:06.666 --> 22:09.375
- And Mrs. Van Rhijn's taste
is not the same

22:09.458 --> 22:11.875
- as Mrs. Russell's.
- So it would appear.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.833
Oh, I'm afraid
I should collect the dog

22:14.916 --> 22:16.416
and get back.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.791
Oh, but thank you, Mr. Church.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.583
It is always
so very interesting

22:20.666 --> 22:22.541
to learn how different people
manage things.

22:22.625 --> 22:24.083
Mm.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.250
- You'll squeeze that dog
to death.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.875
- Oh, I just want
to cuddle him

22:30.958 --> 22:32.833
and cuddle him
and never let him go.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.041
- I should watch out.
He'll take off again.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.541
- I would.
- Don't say so.

22:37.625 --> 22:41.375
- Aurora Fane has invited you
to the Academy of Music.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.166
You will hear
John Knowles Paine

22:43.250 --> 22:45.125
conduct
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

22:45.208 --> 22:47.125
It is raising money
for your Miss Barton.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.458
- When is it?
- Friday.

22:49.541 --> 22:51.916
Aurora will collect you
on her way.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.208
- That sounds fun.
Will you come?

22:54.291 --> 22:56.333
I'd rather be put to death.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.250
- Don't you approve
of the Academy?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.125
- I do, and I can manage opera
as long as I can talk,

23:01.208 --> 23:04.458
but sitting through a symphony
is beyond me.

23:04.541 --> 23:08.250
- This has just been delivered
for Miss Marian.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.250
Oh.

23:26.333 --> 23:27.416
Hmm.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.250
Is there no letter?

23:31.333 --> 23:34.250
Do you know whom it is from?

23:34.333 --> 23:37.791
- Yes.
- An admirer?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.583
Not in that way.

23:39.666 --> 23:41.708
- Marian, I cannot have
an object in the house

23:41.791 --> 23:44.666
if I'm not allowed
to know its provenance.

23:44.750 --> 23:48.375
- Well, I won't tell you
who sent it,

23:48.458 --> 23:51.125
and so I will return it.

23:51.208 --> 23:52.833
That is reasonable, surely.

23:52.916 --> 23:55.416
- It seems the very opposite
of reasonable to me.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.000
Marian, you would never
entertain advances

23:58.083 --> 24:00.458
from someone whom
I might not consider suitable?

24:00.541 --> 24:01.625
"Entertain advances"?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.916
That sounds like a dance step
in the gavotte.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.583
I must have your word.

24:05.666 --> 24:07.625
- Aunt Agnes, I cannot make
vague promises

24:07.708 --> 24:09.583
about unforeseeable
circumstances

24:09.666 --> 24:11.416
in an unknown future.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.583
- We don't know her at all,
of course.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.333
- We know she's
a kind person, Agnes.

24:22.416 --> 24:24.041
And I do not believe
she would ever do

24:24.125 --> 24:25.333
anything self-destructive.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.625
- "Self-destructive"?

24:26.708 --> 24:28.958
You've been reading
those German books again.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.083
I've warned you before,

24:30.166 --> 24:32.875
just stick to
Louisa May Alcott.

24:32.958 --> 24:34.333
- Have you decided
whether or not

24:34.416 --> 24:35.875
- I'm to have a new governess?
- Not yet.

24:35.958 --> 24:38.083
It's absurd.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.708
Father?

24:39.791 --> 24:41.166
- Couldn't she have
a maid instead?

24:41.250 --> 24:42.291
She has a maid.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.333
I mean a real lady's maid

24:43.416 --> 24:44.833
that could accompany her
when she goes out.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.500
- Although why that's
considered necessary

24:46.583 --> 24:47.500
beats me.

24:47.583 --> 24:48.541
- I hope neither
of you children

24:48.625 --> 24:50.875
want a favor from us
anytime soon.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.625
I had a letter
from Mrs. Fane today.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.458
- She means to call on me.
- Oh?

24:54.541 --> 24:56.666
I wondered if you knew why.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.625
- Perhaps she needs your help
with a charity.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.500
Maybe it's the business
of building a new opera house.

25:00.583 --> 25:01.666
- She won't be
in favor of that.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.250
She will be on the side
of the Academy.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.166
- I'm sure she has a hundred
causes you could help with.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.583
- I hope it's not to be
a repetition

25:06.666 --> 25:08.208
of Mrs. Morris' visit.

25:08.291 --> 25:10.416
Will she beg and plead
for you to be merciful?

25:10.500 --> 25:12.125
No, that's all done with.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.250
- Charles Fane
has come through it.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.250
- Well, I'll see her,
I suppose.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.083
- There was a time
when you would've run

25:18.166 --> 25:19.625
a red carpet
to the edge of the sidewalk

25:19.708 --> 25:21.375
if you thought
Mrs. Charles Fane

25:21.458 --> 25:24.500
- might pay you a visit.
- I'm stronger now than I was.

25:24.583 --> 25:27.375
Thank you, Church.
I think we're done with this.

25:30.166 --> 25:32.666
- I saw
Oscar van Rhijn today.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.250
He was fishing
for a dinner invitation.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.750
You wouldn't mind,
would you?

25:35.833 --> 25:37.041
He refused our invitations

25:37.125 --> 25:38.750
when I was in trouble
with the aldermen.

25:38.833 --> 25:41.541
- Then perhaps his renewed
interest is a good sign.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.375
- Because it means
that word on the street

25:43.458 --> 25:45.166
is that I've triumphed?

25:45.250 --> 25:46.958
Do you think he's after Gladys?

25:47.041 --> 25:48.791
I rather hope not,
if I'm honest.

25:48.875 --> 25:49.833
Why?

25:49.916 --> 25:52.291
He has a decent position
and a bit of money.

25:52.375 --> 25:53.500
And he's clever.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.666
- But is he just looking
for an heiress?

25:55.750 --> 25:58.000
- What's wrong with soup
at any time?

25:58.083 --> 26:00.166
- I'm sure I don't know,
Mr. Baudin.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.291
And you lay the table

26:01.375 --> 26:03.166
as you've always laid
the table.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.333
- True, but I did not know
there were such differences

26:05.416 --> 26:07.500
between English customs
and American.

26:07.583 --> 26:09.083
- So what?
You're American.

26:09.166 --> 26:10.750
Mr. and Mrs. Russell
are American.

26:10.833 --> 26:13.416
- Yes, but does Mrs. Astor
follow the English way

26:13.500 --> 26:14.583
or the American?

26:14.666 --> 26:16.708
- She won't be
coming to dine.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.958
- Still, perhaps
I should find out.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.208
Well, all I know is,

26:20.291 --> 26:22.916
whatever implement
she may pick up to eat with,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.625
the food in this house
is cooked by a French chef,

26:25.708 --> 26:27.416
and nothing can top that.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.666
- Which brings us back
to the chicken soup.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.458
- I saw you set off
for your walk, Mr. Watson,

26:32.541 --> 26:34.250
but you seem a bit
down in the dumps

26:34.333 --> 26:35.458
since you got back.

26:35.541 --> 26:38.833
- No, no.
I think I'm just tired.

26:38.916 --> 26:41.166
I had a nice walk,
as it happens.

26:42.791 --> 26:44.541
- That means
the Master's gone up already.

26:44.625 --> 26:45.791
You better get a move on.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.791
You too, Miss Turner.

26:52.541 --> 26:54.166
What's the matter with you?

26:54.250 --> 26:55.333
How do you mean?

26:55.416 --> 26:58.291
- You sound so angry
all the time.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.458
I'm wasting my life here.

27:00.541 --> 27:03.791
- Then leave.
Or change things.

27:03.875 --> 27:05.958
I'll leave when I'm ready.

27:06.041 --> 27:09.625
But I may decide
to change things.

27:12.125 --> 27:14.333
- May I come in?
- Of course.

27:18.333 --> 27:21.625
- And now may I know who sent
the beautiful carved box?

27:22.958 --> 27:24.500
Mrs. Chamberlain.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.500
- Oh, dear.
This is very bad.

27:26.583 --> 27:28.666
- You understand
why I wouldn't tell.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.416
- If Agnes knew,
we should none of us

27:30.500 --> 27:31.458
have any sleep for a month.

27:31.541 --> 27:33.000
- Also, she'd think
we were friends,

27:33.083 --> 27:36.833
which we are not, really,
although I do like her.

27:36.916 --> 27:40.041
- That in itself
makes me shudder.

27:40.125 --> 27:43.833
I've told you Mrs. Chamberlain
is in a class by herself.

27:43.916 --> 27:47.000
She is far worse
than Mrs. Russell in every way.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.708
To spend time in her company
is to be contaminated.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.750
- I'll take it back tomorrow.
- Do so.

27:52.833 --> 27:54.583
And hand it in
at the door.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.916
But now I have
another question.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.416
Why would you not promise
Aunt Agnes

28:03.500 --> 28:05.708
to marry someone suitable?

28:05.791 --> 28:08.125
- Dearest Aunt Ada,
how could I...

28:08.208 --> 28:10.375
when someone
who is suitable to me

28:10.458 --> 28:11.916
may not be suitable to her?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.875
But surely you intend
to marry a gentleman?

28:14.958 --> 28:18.000
- I will marry a gentle man.
Is that enough?

28:18.083 --> 28:21.000
- For me, maybe,
but not for Agnes.

28:21.083 --> 28:23.541
- Did you ever come
close to marriage?

28:25.958 --> 28:28.250
There was once someone

28:28.333 --> 28:31.041
whom I was taken with.

28:31.125 --> 28:32.166
But he did not meet

28:32.250 --> 28:33.750
your grandfather's
high standards.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.333
- The point is,
did he meet yours?

28:36.416 --> 28:37.958
Well...

28:38.041 --> 28:40.291
I was very young.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.291
- Do you think you should have
married him anyway?

28:42.375 --> 28:44.416
Do you think
you would have been happier?

28:46.041 --> 28:48.291
- That's rather
a cruel question.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.166
- I-I didn't mean it to be.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.750
- You think me a weaker person
than Agnes, and maybe I am.

28:55.166 --> 28:58.166
But even I know
that marrying beneath oneself

28:58.250 --> 29:00.875
is no guarantee of happiness.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.375
I am aware of that.

29:04.458 --> 29:07.083
- And where does Mr. Raikes
stand in all this?

29:07.166 --> 29:10.041
You know Agnes thought
he sent you the carving?

29:10.125 --> 29:13.166
- I wish she hadn't
taken against him.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.208
I'd hate for us
to fall out.

29:16.291 --> 29:18.958
- Just don't plunge in
without thinking.

29:20.250 --> 29:24.375
I will try to be your friend,
whatever comes.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.250
But it'll be simpler
if you can find your beloved

29:27.333 --> 29:29.833
among Mr. McAllister's 400.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.458
And now good night.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.708
Good night.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.833
I thought you'd come.

30:10.916 --> 30:13.583
And I see you've brought
the box back.

30:13.666 --> 30:16.083
Was that
on Mrs. Van Rhijn's orders?

30:16.166 --> 30:17.791
Not quite, but...

30:17.875 --> 30:19.875
she said that if I wouldn't
tell her who'd given it to me,

30:19.958 --> 30:21.625
then I couldn't keep it.

30:21.708 --> 30:24.000
- I shall always regard it
as yours.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.833
- Now, what can I offer you?
- Nothing, thank you.

30:28.250 --> 30:31.833
But I'm admiring
your pictures.

30:31.916 --> 30:34.625
- Come into the gallery.
They're better there.

30:39.166 --> 30:41.041
This is one
of the first paintings

30:41.125 --> 30:43.041
we bought together--

30:43.125 --> 30:47.083
an early Corot,
of the forest at Fontainebleau.

30:47.166 --> 30:49.083
It's lovely.

30:49.166 --> 30:52.416
Did you inherit a collection?
Or did Mr. Chamberlain?

30:52.500 --> 30:53.708
Oh, no.

30:53.791 --> 30:57.083
We're what your aunt would call
"new people."

30:57.166 --> 31:00.708
But my husband had
something better than birth.

31:00.791 --> 31:02.833
- What was that?
- Luck.

31:02.916 --> 31:04.875
Right from the start.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.583
Where did he start?

31:06.666 --> 31:09.041
- In Keweenaw County
in Michigan.

31:09.125 --> 31:10.541
He was there
when they sank

31:10.625 --> 31:13.208
the Cliff copper mines
in 1845.

31:13.291 --> 31:14.833
How did you meet?

31:14.916 --> 31:17.250
Why do you ask that?

31:17.333 --> 31:19.750
- I don't know. I--
No reason.

31:19.833 --> 31:22.125
- I'll ask another question.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.958
Did you build
the collection together?

31:24.041 --> 31:27.416
- Mr. Chamberlain was a widower
when he married me.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.500
He and his first wife
did not fully understand

31:30.583 --> 31:32.833
the power that money
had put into their hands.

31:32.916 --> 31:34.958
I showed him.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.916
- So you taught him
how to live.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.541
- And we had
a wonderful life together.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.708
I miss him very much.

31:43.791 --> 31:46.083
- And your son,
does he live here?

31:46.166 --> 31:49.250
- Oh, no, he--
he grew tired of New York.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.333
He lives in Chicago.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.750
I must go.

31:54.833 --> 31:56.833
But thank you
for showing me your treasures.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.750
- You must return,
and I'll show you more.

31:59.833 --> 32:03.333
Besides, you will need
to visit your carving.

32:06.916 --> 32:09.416
- But why? You and Mrs. Morris
have made it clear

32:09.500 --> 32:11.333
that you are only interested
in my checkbook

32:11.416 --> 32:13.458
and not very interested
in that.

32:13.541 --> 32:15.333
Have you seen Mrs. Morris?

32:15.416 --> 32:17.041
- Not since the death
of her husband.

32:17.125 --> 32:19.333
- A sad business.
- Yes.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.375
- May we have some coffee?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:27.166 --> 32:29.250
- Mr. Russell has been
very generous to us.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.333
Has he?

32:30.416 --> 32:33.125
- He helped us through
a very difficult time.

32:33.208 --> 32:35.125
- And you want to return
the favor.

32:35.208 --> 32:36.583
If I can.

32:36.666 --> 32:38.291
- How would you suggest
we begin?

32:38.375 --> 32:41.041
I've thought about this.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.000
I believe the best way
would be to invite you

32:43.083 --> 32:44.541
to luncheon
with Mr. McAllister.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.208
- Ward McAllister?
- That's it.

32:47.291 --> 32:48.916
He's a sort of henchman
to Mrs. Astor.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.541
He helps her in her work
of shaping society.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.583
- And Mrs. Astor
takes his advice?

32:54.666 --> 32:56.708
- I don't know that she ever
takes advice exactly,

32:56.791 --> 32:58.666
but she allows him
to help her.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.250
He is her amanuensis.

33:00.333 --> 33:01.833
- I'm to lunch
with Mr. McAllister

33:01.916 --> 33:03.000
but not with Mrs. Astor?

33:03.083 --> 33:05.166
- I'm afraid she always wants
a list of her fellow guests

33:05.250 --> 33:08.166
and seldom agrees to sit
at a table with strangers.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.541
- Especially strangers like me.
- That's not true.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.000
She does let new people in.

33:12.083 --> 33:14.458
She has to, or they'll
forge an alternative society

33:14.541 --> 33:16.750
and keep her
and the old crowd out.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.000
Won't they anyway?

33:18.083 --> 33:20.791
- Probably, but not
in her time.

33:20.875 --> 33:21.958
How can you be sure

33:22.041 --> 33:23.708
that Mr. McAllister
will want to meet me?

33:23.791 --> 33:25.666
He's dying to see this house.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.583
It's one of the only palaces
on the avenue

33:27.666 --> 33:29.625
he's never been inside.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.625
And...

33:31.708 --> 33:34.208
- And?
- He loves money.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.583
Will you tell your circle

33:37.666 --> 33:39.375
of this labor
you've undertaken?

33:39.458 --> 33:40.916
- I'll tell them
we're friends now.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.541
And to that end,
I wonder if you'd join me

33:43.625 --> 33:45.125
for a concert on Friday.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.250
- At the Academy of Music?
- Of course.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.208
- Well, I have said before now

33:49.291 --> 33:51.500
that I must begin somewhere.

33:54.291 --> 33:55.958
- We keep bumping
into Jay Gould

33:56.041 --> 33:57.500
wherever we go
and whatever we do.

33:57.583 --> 33:58.916
- Now he's got
the Missouri Pacific,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.083
we can't avoid him.

34:00.166 --> 34:02.208
I'm told he has 15%
of all the track

34:02.291 --> 34:03.583
in the United States.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.625
- Is it time
to approach Morgan?

34:05.708 --> 34:08.125
- If you dine with J.P. Morgan,
you should use a long spoon.

34:09.375 --> 34:10.791
Did you see
the news from Russia?

34:10.875 --> 34:12.625
- The accident at Tcherny,
you mean.

34:12.708 --> 34:15.125
- More than 150 dead--
men, women, and children.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.708
- How terrible.
- Mm.

34:17.791 --> 34:19.250
Then there was the crash
at Spuyten Duyvil

34:19.333 --> 34:21.208
and, after that,
one at Little Silver.

34:21.291 --> 34:23.291
- Well, we certainly take
safety very seriously

34:23.375 --> 34:24.833
- in this company.
- Maybe.

34:24.916 --> 34:27.416
But I'd like some
more insurance just in case.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.041
- What if you got
behind a charity

34:29.125 --> 34:30.625
that deals in disasters?

34:30.708 --> 34:32.250
- Go on.
- Yes.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.625
If nothing ever happens,

34:33.708 --> 34:35.416
we'd be a benevolent force
in society.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.250
And if there is trouble,
we'd get help at once

34:38.333 --> 34:39.458
and offset any charge

34:39.541 --> 34:41.375
of not caring
for our passengers.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.291
- As it happens,
Mrs. Fane wants me to go

34:43.375 --> 34:46.291
to a concert on Friday
in aid of the Red Cross.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.166
- Tell me
about the Red Cross.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.375
- Well, a woman called Barton
wants to established branches

34:50.458 --> 34:51.666
all over America

34:51.750 --> 34:53.291
to give help to people
caught in a disaster.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.791
- Does she need money?
- Very much so.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.666
So far, she's only managed
to open one branch--

34:56.750 --> 34:59.125
at Dansville
in Upstate New York.

34:59.208 --> 35:00.208
Then you must go.

35:00.291 --> 35:01.666
I'd like to see you
on the board.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.333
I'll never be on that board.

35:03.416 --> 35:05.500
One of her main patrons
is Anne Morris.

35:05.583 --> 35:07.916
- You are more than a match
for Anne Morris, my dear.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.708
You'll find a way.

35:11.791 --> 35:13.958
- She still
won't invite them here?

35:14.041 --> 35:16.291
- Why does it matter,
when you go there freely?

35:16.375 --> 35:18.833
- But I don't, not anymore.
They've dropped me.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.708
- Oh.
Do you know why?

35:20.791 --> 35:23.083
- I blame Patrick Morris.
- Poor man.

35:23.166 --> 35:24.625
- He told me
that Russell was finished.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.958
Everyone thought so,
and I believed them.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.708
- So it was you
who dropped them,

35:28.791 --> 35:30.375
not the other way around.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.208
Now I'm on their side.

35:32.291 --> 35:34.041
- I must get back
into that house.

35:34.125 --> 35:37.208
- Does this have anything to do
with Miss Russell?

35:37.291 --> 35:39.583
Well, I've made my delivery.

35:39.666 --> 35:41.416
- I hope you didn't speak
to her.

35:41.500 --> 35:42.666
What's this?

35:42.750 --> 35:46.208
- Marian had to leave something
for Mrs. Chamberlain.

35:46.291 --> 35:48.708
- But don't tell.
- Heavens.

35:50.083 --> 35:52.208
- What was the house like?
- Very grand.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.333
And the pictures
are simply fabulous.

35:54.416 --> 35:55.666
One of them had
very good taste.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.041
- She had the taste,
the looks, and the brains.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.458
He had the money.

35:59.541 --> 36:00.833
- Rather sharp for you,
Aunt Ada.

36:00.916 --> 36:03.291
- We shall have to stop talking
about her when Mama comes in.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.500
- What precisely
has she done wrong?

36:05.583 --> 36:08.083
- She lived in sin for years
with old Chamberlain

36:08.166 --> 36:10.583
until his long-suffering wife
finally died.

36:10.666 --> 36:12.583
Then he brought her
to New York,

36:12.666 --> 36:14.250
and they pretended
they'd only just met.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.083
- I thought
she was married before?

36:16.166 --> 36:17.625
- Hmm, she says that
to explain the boy.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.625
- Her son?
- The son of them both.

36:20.708 --> 36:22.375
She only says
her husband adopted him

36:22.458 --> 36:23.750
for the look of the thing.

36:23.833 --> 36:26.583
He is the spitting image
of Chamberlain, for a start.

36:26.666 --> 36:28.000
- Is that why
he lives in Chicago?

36:28.083 --> 36:29.750
- He must have got tired
of people whispering

36:29.833 --> 36:31.708
behind their hands every time
he walked into a room.

36:31.791 --> 36:34.375
- Aunt Ada, is this true?
- People think it's true.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.208
What do people think is true?

36:36.291 --> 36:38.541
- That they're opening
the East River Bridge

36:38.625 --> 36:39.750
next year.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.166
Hmm, and about time, too.

36:41.250 --> 36:42.791
- What a difference
it will make

36:42.875 --> 36:44.083
with the journey to Brooklyn.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.583
- Why would you want
to go to Brooklyn?

36:45.666 --> 36:47.375
- As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking

36:47.458 --> 36:49.041
of paying someone
a surprise visit.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.500
She may need cheering up.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.666
- So should I
if I lived in Brooklyn.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.875
Come in.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.333
I shouldn't have left you
to finish up on your own.

37:41.416 --> 37:44.958
- Never mind that.
It's all done now.

37:57.708 --> 38:01.125
- I never knew kindness
till I came to this house.

38:03.541 --> 38:05.458
But I still can't talk
about it.

38:05.541 --> 38:07.708
Well, then you don't have to.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.500
- There's a part of me
wants to tell.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.041
That's the funny thing.

38:15.125 --> 38:17.375
I'd like to somehow
get it out of me.

38:19.666 --> 38:22.666
- Did your mother beat you?
- It wasn't that!

38:25.291 --> 38:28.041
It was what she didn't do.

38:28.125 --> 38:30.000
She knew about things.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.583
She did nothing
to stop them.

38:35.958 --> 38:37.125
But if it wasn't her,

38:37.208 --> 38:39.875
then who was doing
these things?

38:51.708 --> 38:54.666
- Oh.
Oh, my Lord.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.875
You poor darling girl.

38:59.041 --> 39:01.041
- Now you know
why I hate her.

39:01.125 --> 39:02.583
- But wasn't he
the one to blame?

39:02.666 --> 39:04.250
He was mad.

39:06.458 --> 39:09.250
But she was evil.

39:09.333 --> 39:12.250
She sat downstairs
and let it happen.

39:14.125 --> 39:17.041
- Oh.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.916
What are you--

39:36.000 --> 39:37.583
Bertha?

39:42.083 --> 39:45.333
- How did you get in here?
- Through the door.

39:48.583 --> 39:51.291
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.

39:55.375 --> 39:57.333
- That is
never going to happen.

39:57.416 --> 39:59.791
- Really?
I believe you're lonely.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.000
- No, I'm not.
- I believe you need a woman

40:02.083 --> 40:04.250
who will help you
to become the finest

40:04.333 --> 40:06.125
and the best man
that you can be.

40:06.208 --> 40:08.125
I've already got one.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.583
Be honest.

40:09.666 --> 40:13.291
Haven't you ever wanted a woman
who thinks only of you?

40:13.375 --> 40:16.416
Mrs. Russell has
many qualities,

40:16.500 --> 40:18.791
but she has her own campaign
to wage in the world.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.833
She has no time for yours.

40:20.916 --> 40:22.791
And you do?

40:22.875 --> 40:25.666
If you'll let me...

40:25.750 --> 40:28.166
I can make a sanctuary for you,

40:28.250 --> 40:31.666
a temple to your greatness.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.541
My greatness?

40:35.583 --> 40:40.333
The flaw in your argument
is that I love my wife.

40:40.416 --> 40:41.958
I have no desire
for a mistress,

40:42.041 --> 40:43.750
no wish for another helpmeet,

40:43.833 --> 40:47.250
no need for any sanctuary
beyond this house.

40:47.333 --> 40:50.791
- So what is
my punishment to be...

40:50.875 --> 40:52.750
for falling in love with you?

40:59.875 --> 41:02.208
Go back to your room now.

41:02.291 --> 41:05.541
Say nothing more...

41:05.625 --> 41:07.750
and we will never mention
the subject again.

41:12.791 --> 41:14.166
Why?

41:15.791 --> 41:18.458
My wife trusts you

41:18.541 --> 41:20.708
and holds you in high regard.

41:20.791 --> 41:22.416
She's grateful
for your guidance,

41:22.500 --> 41:24.833
and I would not wish
to spoil that for her

41:24.916 --> 41:27.333
because of your misjudgment.

41:27.416 --> 41:29.041
Now please go.

42:09.250 --> 42:13.125
I am at war with this crab.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.708
- I think you should surrender.

42:15.791 --> 42:18.500
You think this is bad...

42:18.583 --> 42:20.500
You never ate
with my Uncle William.

42:20.583 --> 42:23.083
Mm. Oh, boy.

42:23.166 --> 42:26.625
He could make you lose
your whole appetite.

42:26.708 --> 42:28.625
He'd take
a fork full of eggs,

42:28.708 --> 42:30.791
then dip that same fork
into the jelly.

42:32.208 --> 42:35.208
I was always picking little
bits of egg out of my jelly.

42:35.291 --> 42:37.250
- Are you trying
to ruin our luncheon?

42:37.333 --> 42:38.958
- He ruined my breakfast
for years.

42:42.541 --> 42:44.625
What happened to him?

42:44.708 --> 42:46.500
Oh...

42:46.583 --> 42:48.958
they, uh...

42:49.041 --> 42:53.041
they sold him away
before emancipation came.

42:56.500 --> 42:59.291
God bless him.

42:59.375 --> 43:00.750
Mmm.

43:00.833 --> 43:02.375
I almost forgot.

43:02.458 --> 43:04.625
I ran into Mrs. Barber
at church.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.208
Her son Paul just graduated

43:06.291 --> 43:09.041
from Howard University's
medical department.

43:09.125 --> 43:10.000
You remember Paul?

43:10.083 --> 43:11.833
- Haven't seen him
since we were children.

43:11.916 --> 43:13.666
- Well, he's back now,
just like you.

43:13.750 --> 43:16.208
I told her to expect
a dinner invitation.

43:16.291 --> 43:18.833
She was quite eager
to tell Paul

43:18.916 --> 43:22.208
- that you were home.
- But I'm not really.

43:22.291 --> 43:24.708
- You will join us
for dinner, though?

43:24.791 --> 43:26.333
- Mother, I don't want
to disappoint you

43:26.416 --> 43:27.625
on your birthday.

43:27.708 --> 43:29.333
- They got you
so busy over there,

43:29.416 --> 43:31.125
you can't have one evening
with your family?

43:31.208 --> 43:32.458
That is not what I said.

43:32.541 --> 43:34.625
- She's busy.
That is better than being idle.

43:34.708 --> 43:36.291
Busy doing what exactly?

43:36.375 --> 43:38.291
- I've sold a story
to "The New York Globe."

43:38.375 --> 43:41.250
- Hmm.
- That's marvelous news.

43:41.333 --> 43:43.083
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

43:43.166 --> 43:45.625
We could have made this
a double celebration.

43:45.708 --> 43:46.833
- You should have tried
them first.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.916
- I sent my work out to
"The Globe" and "The Advocate"

43:49.000 --> 43:50.166
at the same time.

43:50.250 --> 43:51.666
- They'll give you
more opportunities

43:51.750 --> 43:53.250
than "The Advocate"
would have done.

43:53.333 --> 43:55.416
- I think they will.
- But not much money.

44:21.583 --> 44:23.541
Are you gonna quit
working at that house?

44:23.625 --> 44:26.166
- Of course not.
I've only sold one story.

44:26.250 --> 44:27.958
- Besides, I like it there.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.666
We must be pretty bad
for you to choose

44:29.750 --> 44:32.250
to work two jobs
and live like a servant,

44:32.333 --> 44:33.750
when you can stay
in your own home

44:33.833 --> 44:34.916
and work in the drugstore
with me.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.208
- Father, it's
what I want to do.

44:36.291 --> 44:38.166
- Let's not--
- I own the pharmacy,

44:38.250 --> 44:39.916
which I planned
to pass down to you.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.458
But, oh, no, we--

44:44.333 --> 44:46.041
Ellen.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.250
Let's toast Peggy's success.

44:52.333 --> 44:55.083
She will be
a published author.

44:55.166 --> 44:58.625
- It's a fool's errand,
if you ask me.

45:05.583 --> 45:07.250
May I help you?

45:07.333 --> 45:11.500
- Um, I'm here
to see Miss Scott.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.916
They're at luncheon.

45:16.208 --> 45:17.791
Do you have a card?

45:45.625 --> 45:48.416
- Who is it?
- Miss Marian Brook.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.541
What?

45:49.625 --> 45:51.916
- Did you invite her?
- No, sir.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.625
- Well, we can't
just leave her outside,

45:53.708 --> 45:55.125
show her into the parlor.

46:08.083 --> 46:11.416
- Miss Brook.
- I'm Marian Brook, Mrs. Scott.

46:11.500 --> 46:14.500
- What are you doing here?
- I thought I'd surprise you.

46:14.583 --> 46:16.375
You succeeded.

46:16.458 --> 46:18.958
Miss Brook is the niece
of Mrs. Van Rhijn.

46:19.041 --> 46:22.125
- Why have you come?
- What Mr. Scott means is--

46:22.208 --> 46:24.916
- My daughter works
for your aunt.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.250
Why are you here uninvited?

46:27.333 --> 46:28.958
Arthur.

46:29.041 --> 46:30.666
What's in the bag?

46:30.750 --> 46:33.333
- Oh, well, I--

46:33.416 --> 46:35.666
I wanted to bring
something useful.

46:35.750 --> 46:39.666
But I'm not sure they will be
very useful after all.

46:39.750 --> 46:41.291
Can't we see?

46:42.500 --> 46:44.416
If you've brought it
all this way...

47:00.875 --> 47:02.666
Old shoes?

47:05.458 --> 47:07.375
I thought...

47:12.458 --> 47:15.125
- What did you think,
Miss Brook?

47:15.208 --> 47:18.583
That we would need
cast-off shoes?

47:18.666 --> 47:20.916
I'm so sorry.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.333
I--

47:23.416 --> 47:25.416
- She must have wondered
if you knew of a charity

47:25.500 --> 47:27.458
- that could use them.
- That's it.

47:27.541 --> 47:30.625
I hoped you'd have an idea
of how they might do some good.

47:30.708 --> 47:32.416
But why bring them here,

47:32.500 --> 47:35.750
when there are so many
charities in Manhattan?

47:39.125 --> 47:41.833
- You're right.

47:41.916 --> 47:45.041
- Miss Ellen, can you fetch
my gloves, please?

47:45.125 --> 47:47.458
- But we haven't had
my birthday cake.

47:47.541 --> 47:49.208
You're welcome to join us,
Miss Brook.

47:49.291 --> 47:50.666
You're very kind, Mrs. Scott.

47:50.750 --> 47:53.541
Happy birthday
and many happy returns.

47:53.625 --> 47:56.166
- Yes, Mother, many happy
returns, but we're going now.

48:03.208 --> 48:04.458
Goodbye, Miss Ellen.

48:11.208 --> 48:15.250
- Well, we have certainly taken
a step forward today.

48:15.333 --> 48:17.291
Thank you for that.

48:17.375 --> 48:19.750
Dorothy...

48:19.833 --> 48:23.458
our responsibility
is to raise a child

48:23.541 --> 48:26.750
with a sense
of right and wrong.

48:26.833 --> 48:30.083
I cannot put that aside
to play Happy Families.

48:30.166 --> 48:31.666
No.

48:31.750 --> 48:35.083
And it's not a game we are
very well equipped for, is it?

48:45.333 --> 48:47.166
What are you doing here?

48:47.250 --> 48:49.583
And the shoes--
what was that?

48:49.666 --> 48:52.000
Because we're colored,
we must be poor?

48:52.083 --> 48:55.208
- I loaned you train fare!
- I made a stupid assumption.

48:55.291 --> 48:57.833
- And you just showed up
at my parents' home.

48:57.916 --> 48:59.833
- What's so wrong
about that?

48:59.916 --> 49:02.125
My aunt lets you live
at her house.

49:02.208 --> 49:04.958
Lets me?

49:05.041 --> 49:06.625
- I work there.
- I know--

49:06.708 --> 49:09.000
- No, you don't know
anything...

49:09.083 --> 49:12.500
about me, about my life,
about my situation.

49:12.583 --> 49:15.916
I live in a different country
from the one you know.

49:17.416 --> 49:19.541
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry!

49:20.875 --> 49:23.833
Just stop thinking
you're really my friend.

49:42.708 --> 49:45.541
- Heavens.
What a vision.

49:45.625 --> 49:47.666
The whole audience
will be looking at you.

49:47.750 --> 49:49.166
You are sweet.

49:49.250 --> 49:52.541
Is the carriage here yet?
Turner said she thought so.

49:52.625 --> 49:54.166
It is.

49:54.250 --> 49:56.833
- Have I seen this cloak before?
- I'm sure you have.

49:56.916 --> 49:58.666
But I must run.
I'm terribly late as it is.

49:58.750 --> 50:01.166
And I don't want to arrive
after they've started.

50:20.666 --> 50:23.083
Miss Turner...

50:23.166 --> 50:25.416
is something keeping you?

51:14.833 --> 51:16.458
It's a very good turnout.

51:16.541 --> 51:18.916
- People do seem to believe
in Miss Barton.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.458
- Mr. Russell certainly
believes in her

51:20.541 --> 51:21.708
and her Red Cross.

51:21.791 --> 51:23.625
He'd like me
to be more involved.

51:23.708 --> 51:25.416
That might serve our turn,

51:25.500 --> 51:27.583
- if we play it carefully.
- Mm.

51:27.666 --> 51:28.666
I must see to the others.

51:28.750 --> 51:31.000
Marian, please look
after Mrs. Russell.

51:31.083 --> 51:32.125
Don't worry about me.

51:32.208 --> 51:33.833
I supposed you know
plenty of people here.

51:33.916 --> 51:34.875
Not at all.

51:34.958 --> 51:38.166
But I've read about this
so often in novels.

51:38.250 --> 51:40.125
I envy your fan.

51:40.208 --> 51:43.000
I wish I had one
so I could cover my face

51:43.083 --> 51:45.125
and look fascinating.

51:45.208 --> 51:47.625
- You look very fascinating
to me.

51:47.708 --> 51:49.291
- Mr. Raikes.
- Hello, Miss Brook.

51:49.375 --> 51:51.083
Hello.

51:51.166 --> 51:52.625
- Do you know
Mrs. George Russell?

51:52.708 --> 51:53.791
How do you do?

51:53.875 --> 51:56.333
- And Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Fane.

51:56.416 --> 51:57.666
Who are you here with?

51:57.750 --> 52:00.916
- Mrs. Henry Schermerhorn.
She has the next box.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.291
- Is this yours, Mrs. Russell?
- Oh, no, I don't have one.

52:04.375 --> 52:05.916
- There's
a terrible waiting list.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.666
Especially for me.

52:07.750 --> 52:09.250
Come, Mrs. Russell.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.166
Let me introduce you
to some of our friends.

52:14.291 --> 52:16.750
Why are you here, really?

52:16.833 --> 52:18.583
- My lady was in
a high window,

52:18.666 --> 52:20.291
so I realized
I needed a long ladder.

52:20.375 --> 52:22.791
- Be serious.
- I mean it.

52:22.875 --> 52:24.708
I know you're aunts
don't think me suitable.

52:24.791 --> 52:27.375
So I'm striving to improve
myself until they do.

52:27.458 --> 52:29.041
I'm ready to do
anything you want.

52:29.125 --> 52:30.708
But how have you managed it?

52:30.791 --> 52:33.333
- Two years ago, I took
a new course in property law

52:33.416 --> 52:34.875
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

52:34.958 --> 52:37.125
Gerry Schermerhorn
was on the same one.

52:37.208 --> 52:39.000
- Did you know he lived
in New York?

52:39.083 --> 52:40.916
I did, but we'd lost touch.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.875
But then one day,
I was roller-skating

52:42.958 --> 52:44.125
at the rink
next to Central Park,

52:44.208 --> 52:46.083
and we ran into each other,
literally.

52:46.166 --> 52:48.000
And you're building on that?

52:48.083 --> 52:49.333
I'm trying to.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.791
The way these people live here
is quite amazing.

52:51.875 --> 52:53.791
- You're enjoying
yourself, then?

52:53.875 --> 52:56.083
- More than I could have
imagined.

52:56.166 --> 52:58.416
But I haven't got
what I really want...

52:58.500 --> 52:59.916
not yet.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.041
Perhaps you're right,

53:01.125 --> 53:03.333
and it's time
to call on us again.

53:03.416 --> 53:05.041
Do you mean that?

53:05.125 --> 53:08.041
- Do you want me to call?
- Well, I do.

53:11.125 --> 53:12.750
I have a question.

53:12.833 --> 53:15.541
What would you say to me
if your aunts didn't exist?

53:15.625 --> 53:18.041
- You're the second person
to ask me that.

53:18.125 --> 53:20.250
- Who was the first?
- Peggy Scott.

53:20.333 --> 53:22.750
Then I salute her.

53:22.833 --> 53:25.375
- But we must try
to win them over.

53:25.458 --> 53:29.375
If we don't, then all this
will be lost to you.

53:29.458 --> 53:30.541
You do understand?

53:30.625 --> 53:33.625
- I hope it doesn't come
to that, I admit.

53:33.708 --> 53:36.416
But if it does,
I don't care.

53:36.500 --> 53:38.291
Not if I have you.

53:38.375 --> 53:41.625
- Who has cornered
my Mr. Raikes?

53:41.708 --> 53:44.875
- This is Miss Marian Brook,
Mrs. Van Rhijn's niece.

53:44.958 --> 53:46.166
Mrs. Henry Schermerhorn.

53:46.250 --> 53:48.125
- I'm delighted to meet you,
Miss Brook.

53:48.208 --> 53:51.458
But, Mr. Raikes, I must insist
you rejoin my party.

53:51.541 --> 53:53.666
I've promised you
to Miranda Fife,

53:53.750 --> 53:55.291
and I never break my word.

53:55.375 --> 53:57.166
- Of course.

53:59.291 --> 54:01.416
Send me a message
when you want to see me.

54:07.583 --> 54:09.250
Quite a man about town.

54:09.333 --> 54:11.416
- And he's done it
in record time.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.791
- Who is he?
- Thomas Raikes.

54:13.875 --> 54:15.875
An old friend
from Pennsylvania.

54:15.958 --> 54:17.833
- He seems very at home
in New York.

54:17.916 --> 54:21.166
- I know.
It's quite astonishing, really.

54:21.250 --> 54:23.208
When he first got here,
he knew nobody,

54:23.291 --> 54:25.375
and now he's in a box
at the Academy.

54:25.458 --> 54:27.541
- You see, Mrs. Russell?
It can be done.

54:27.625 --> 54:28.625
Mm.

54:28.708 --> 54:30.500
Does he have money,
your Mr. Raikes?

54:30.583 --> 54:31.625
I don't think so.

54:31.708 --> 54:33.333
Not what you would call money.

54:33.416 --> 54:35.875
- Pity, when he's
enjoying himself so much.

54:35.958 --> 54:38.458
He may find it hard
to keep up without it.

54:38.541 --> 54:40.041
- Now for the third movement--

54:40.125 --> 54:44.125
"A Romance of Springtime,"
how lovely.

54:44.208 --> 54:45.666
What's the matter, Marian?

54:45.750 --> 54:48.458
- Don't you like the sound of it?
- I like it very much.

54:54.166 --> 54:57.333
As long as there's
a happy ending.
