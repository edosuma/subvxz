Thanks for letting me
drive, Harriette.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.066
When do I get
to do it again?

01:30.100 --> 01:32.200
How about
"The Twelfth Of Never?"

01:32.233 --> 01:34.400
I'll pencil you in.

01:34.433 --> 01:35.500
So, are you and Larry
going with us

01:35.533 --> 01:37.233
on the company camping‐trip?

01:37.266 --> 01:39.666
Oh, I am, but,
uh, Cousin Larry

01:39.700 --> 01:41.733
don't do well
out of doors.

01:41.766 --> 01:44.300
I know my Cousin Larry
like the back of my hand

01:44.333 --> 01:47.733
there's no way, no how,
Cousin Larry is going camping.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.166
Balki..

01:50.200 --> 01:51.133
...we're going camping.

01:53.266 --> 01:54.466
Bad call.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.166
Cousin,
I don't understand.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.200
‐ You said you hate camping.
‐ I do.

02:04.233 --> 02:05.466
But, Jennifer loves it.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.600
She thinks it's romantic.

02:06.633 --> 02:08.733
This is my chance
to get Jennifer away

02:08.765 --> 02:11.166
for a romantic weekend.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.666
Wait a minute, cousin.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.200
I'm getting a deja voodoo.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.333
The last time you tried
to get Jennifer away

02:20.366 --> 02:24.066
for a romantic weekend,
was the time you took us skiing

02:24.100 --> 02:27.766
which resulted in our being
trapped in an avalanche.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.433
Jennifer has forgotten
all about that.

02:29.466 --> 02:30.533
Oh, is that right?

02:30.566 --> 02:32.266
‐ Yes, it is.
‐ Really?

02:32.300 --> 02:33.466
Well, that's interesting

02:33.500 --> 02:34.633
I would have thought
it would be hard

02:34.666 --> 02:36.600
to forget
being buried alive.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.666
‐ Hi, guys.
‐ 'Hi, Jennifer.'

02:41.700 --> 02:42.633
Are you ready
to go to lunch?

02:42.666 --> 02:45.100
Jennifer, I have a wonderful
surprise for you.

02:45.133 --> 02:47.033
How would you like
to go camping?

02:47.066 --> 02:49.200
I'd love it.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.566
Oh, you‐you‐you mean
with you?

02:53.533 --> 02:55.500
The memory
lingers on.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.433
You know,
I still hyperventilate

02:58.466 --> 02:59.500
every time
I pass a ski shop.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.533
Well, you've got to be
equipped with a paper bag.

03:01.566 --> 03:02.733
Slip it over your head
and do

03:02.766 --> 03:04.366
some deep breathing,
get it all up here.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.566
Like this, right‐‐

03:05.600 --> 03:06.666
Okay, okay, hey,
people, people, people.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.066
Hey, hey, hey.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.333
Doesn't "Forgive and forget"
mean anything?

03:12.500 --> 03:13.466
‐ No.
‐ No.

03:15.533 --> 03:17.366
This trip will be different.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.500
It's totally organized.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.500
We'll be with a big group.

03:20.766 --> 03:22.133
I don't know.

03:22.166 --> 03:23.566
You..

03:23.600 --> 03:24.633
...the woods..

03:25.633 --> 03:27.400
...so much could go wrong.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.166
You're right. You're right,
you are absolutely right.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.300
I couldn't agree
with you more.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.100
And, and, and I wouldn't even
go camping with just me.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.600
And that's why, uh..

03:43.633 --> 03:46.633
...that's why, uh,
uh, that's why

03:46.666 --> 03:50.600
Balki is going to be
the camping leader.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.133
‐ I am?
‐ Didn't I tell you that?

03:52.166 --> 03:53.066
‐ No.
‐ Where's my head?

03:53.100 --> 03:54.533
Oh, it's a good thing
I'm not in charge.

03:57.266 --> 03:58.200
I‐I'm going to be
the leader?

03:58.233 --> 03:59.433
Yes.

03:59.466 --> 04:00.600
Oh, you never
let me lead before.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.033
Well, you weren't
ready before.

04:02.066 --> 04:03.366
‐ No.
‐ No, now you are.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.033
‐ Yes?
‐ Yes.

04:05.066 --> 04:07.166
Balki is a master
of the wilderness.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.133
Why, he was practically
born outdoors.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.266
I was born outdoors.

04:12.533 --> 04:13.733
Well, there you are.

04:13.766 --> 04:16.033
Can I pick
a leader or what?

04:16.065 --> 04:18.300
Well, I‐I guess if Balki
is going to lead‐‐

04:18.333 --> 04:20.300
You'll go. Great.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.533
Balki, you wanna
lead us to lunch?

04:22.566 --> 04:25.200
Well, this is fun,
let's see..

04:25.233 --> 04:26.333
...how would you
like to go to

04:26.366 --> 04:28.300
Bosco's House
Of Liver And Waffles?

04:31.233 --> 04:32.633
"Liver And Waffles?"

04:32.666 --> 04:34.166
Well, if you don't mind
the drive‐thru

04:34.200 --> 04:36.200
there's always
Eels On Wheels.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.533
Uh, Larry why don't
you lead this one?

04:39.566 --> 04:41.433
Yeah.

04:41.466 --> 04:43.166
Well, uh‐uh,
there‐there's always

04:43.200 --> 04:47.233
Jack's Escargo‐go
with the little snails that go..

04:58.700 --> 05:00.600
Cousin..

05:00.633 --> 05:02.733
...Mary‐Mary Anne
said that, uh..

05:02.766 --> 05:05.633
...that, that she
would be, um..

05:05.666 --> 05:08.633
...coming with us.
What is all this?

05:08.666 --> 05:12.500
Balki, this is what we
need to go camping.

05:15.533 --> 05:19.166
Here's your state‐of‐the‐art
all‐season tent.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.333
Your self‐contained,
self‐igniting propane stove.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.633
Your double‐mantled,
high‐intensity

05:25.666 --> 05:28.066
camping lantern
with optional bug light.

05:31.466 --> 05:33.200
Cousin, you're
bringing beer?

05:35.566 --> 05:36.733
Bug light.

05:39.066 --> 05:40.333
Bug light.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.566
But, cousin, I‐I, I thought
the idea of camping

05:50.600 --> 05:54.633
was just man and nature
with nothing in between.

05:54.666 --> 05:56.700
Don't you think
I know that?

05:56.733 --> 05:59.733
And hey, if it were
just you and me..

05:59.766 --> 06:01.600
...I'd bring nothing
but my trusty hunting knife.

06:02.766 --> 06:04.366
But, we're bringing women.

06:09.066 --> 06:11.500
Well, cousin, on Mypos

06:11.533 --> 06:13.800
when we bring women,
it's easier.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.300
They do all
the heavy lifting.

06:18.066 --> 06:20.133
And would Jennifer
and Mary Anne

06:20.166 --> 06:22.333
were like
that hardy breed

06:22.366 --> 06:24.166
but they're not.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.333
Roughing it does not make
American women feel romantic

06:28.366 --> 06:30.633
comfort does.

06:30.666 --> 06:33.233
Well, I‐I‐I want them
to feel comfortable

06:33.266 --> 06:36.333
but "Good Golly, Miss Molly,"
do we really need all this?

06:38.200 --> 06:42.533
Well, I have already whittled
it down to the bare essentials.

06:42.566 --> 06:46.300
I'm still undecided
about the portable shower.

06:52.366 --> 06:54.566
‐ What's this?
‐ Ah.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.200
Take your shoes off

06:56.233 --> 06:58.100
step into this baby,
give it a try.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.466
This..

07:00.500 --> 07:02.766
...is a top‐of‐the‐line

07:02.800 --> 07:05.366
all‐weather..

07:05.400 --> 07:07.466
...water‐proof sleeping bag.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.400
And, when nestled
on a Nature Sleep

07:11.433 --> 07:12.633
super‐soft air mattress

07:12.666 --> 07:16.066
it provides comfort
and warmth.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.600
Two of the ingredients
necessary

07:17.633 --> 07:19.400
for a romantic camping‐trip.

07:21.433 --> 07:24.566
In fact, the man at the store
said that in the event

07:24.600 --> 07:28.133
of an emergency, two people
could fit in this bag.

07:28.166 --> 07:30.133
Well, I think he sold you
a bill of rights.

07:32.266 --> 07:34.133
There's no way you can get
two people in here.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.266
‐ Sure you can.
‐ No, I don't think so.

07:36.300 --> 07:37.366
Well..

07:42.100 --> 07:44.533
‐ What are you doing?
‐ I'll show you.

07:44.566 --> 07:46.633
Well, I, Cousin, can I
just save you some time?

07:46.666 --> 07:49.066
There's no way two people
are gonna fit in this bag.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.233
Well, let me save you
some time.

07:50.266 --> 07:51.766
Two people will fit
in here, no problem.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.466
Alright, there's, you know,
there's other things

07:53.500 --> 07:54.366
we could be doing,
this is..

07:56.566 --> 07:58.333
...this is eating up my day,
you know.

07:59.733 --> 08:00.733
I, I..

08:06.366 --> 08:08.266
There, are
you satisfied?

08:09.733 --> 08:11.033
Well, I'll be
snookered.

08:13.733 --> 08:15.400
‐ Two people can fit in here.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

08:15.433 --> 08:17.266
But they'll have to take
turns breathing.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.066
And if it gets
really cold..

08:23.100 --> 08:24.366
...you just put on
the hood.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.299
My, it's cozy in here.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.466
Of course it is.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.799
Balki, the goose
down in this bag

08:43.832 --> 08:45.033
[screaming]

08:45.066 --> 08:46.800
What, what?

08:46.833 --> 08:48.533
There's a goose,
down in this bag?

08:48.566 --> 08:51.233
No, no, no, Balki,
no, no, stop it.

08:51.266 --> 08:53.166
Balki, just, don't,
you're hysterical.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.600
Balki, stop it.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.466
Ow! Stop it!

08:56.500 --> 08:58.066
Oh, I'd better
stop it, stop it!

09:03.733 --> 09:04.633
Feathers.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.666
Goose feathers.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.566
The goose feathers
in the lining of this bag

09:12.600 --> 09:14.500
will protect us,
down to a temperature

09:14.533 --> 09:16.700
of 60 below.

09:16.733 --> 09:18.500
Well, cousin, I'm sorry.

09:18.533 --> 09:20.266
As a child..

09:20.300 --> 09:22.233
...I had a very traumatic
experience with a goose.

09:32.633 --> 09:33.700
I'll bet you did.

09:35.766 --> 09:37.700
[phone ringing]

09:43.500 --> 09:45.200
Would you like
to get that or shall I?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.033
[phone ringing]

09:59.600 --> 10:01.333
The zipper is stuck.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.666
Too bad you didn't
get a sleeping bag

10:04.700 --> 10:06.633
with a phone in it.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.166
Alright, alright, alright.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.100
Hopping, hopping.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.200
Hopping, hop.
Alright, here.

10:14.233 --> 10:16.100
‐ Hopping, okay?
‐ Hopping, hopping.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.400
‐ Hop, hop, hop.
‐ Hopping, hopping, hop.

10:19.700 --> 10:23.566
[grunting]

10:23.600 --> 10:26.066
[phone ringing]

10:26.100 --> 10:29.533
Alright, alright.

10:29.566 --> 10:31.600
You talk, I'll listen.

10:31.633 --> 10:32.800
Hello, hello?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.700
‐ Balki.
‐ Hello, hello?

10:34.733 --> 10:36.333
‐ Balki.
‐ Hello, hello?

10:36.366 --> 10:37.766
‐ Balki.
‐ Hello, hello?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.733
‐ Balki!
‐ Aah!

10:41.266 --> 10:43.000
‐ What is it?
‐ They hung up.

10:44.366 --> 10:45.333
Oh.

10:56.366 --> 10:58.100
We've got to get out
of this thing.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.366
No kidding.

11:01.566 --> 11:03.333
[knocking]

11:03.366 --> 11:04.533
Who is it?

11:04.566 --> 11:06.600
(Jennifer)
'It's Jennifer.'

11:06.633 --> 11:08.033
Uh, just a minute.

11:08.066 --> 11:09.133
Uh, just a minute.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.566
Uh, oh, over here,
over here.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.766
Alright, alright.
Now, hopping, hopping.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.333
‐ Hopping, hopping, hopping.
‐ Hopping, hopping, hopping.

11:13.366 --> 11:14.733
‐ Hop, hop, hop.
‐ Hopping, hop, hop.

11:14.766 --> 11:16.500
‐ Hop, hop, hop.
‐ Hop, hop, hop.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.266
[grunting]

11:20.600 --> 11:22.533
[grunting]

11:32.566 --> 11:34.500
(in unison)
Hi!

11:37.200 --> 11:40.433
Hi, uh, I was just wondering
when we were..

11:42.233 --> 11:44.566
I, I‐I‐Is this a bad time?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.533
[grunting]

11:52.533 --> 11:54.700
Oh, no, uh, we,
we were just, uh..

11:54.733 --> 11:58.100
...testing
this sleeping bag.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.466
Yeah, what do you think, Balki,
uh, passed the stress test?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.766
Yeah, couple more hours
and we should know for sure.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.633
[grunting]

12:04.666 --> 12:08.100
Oh, uh, Jennifer, uh,
have any gear you need tested?

12:09.266 --> 12:11.033
Uh, no, I was just wondering
what time

12:11.066 --> 12:12.300
we were leaving in the morning.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.300
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh, uh, let's see.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.500
I wanna get up at 5:30
and get in the shower.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.266
You're gonna dry your hair
or just let it air‐dry?

12:17.300 --> 12:18.566
[indistinct chatter]

12:18.600 --> 12:20.233
You want an omelet
for breakfast with feta cheese..

12:20.266 --> 12:22.566
...uh, out the door
by six o'clock, uh..

12:22.600 --> 12:24.033
‐ 6:15?
‐ 6:15?

12:26.733 --> 12:27.700
Fine.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.733
Uh, Balki is still
our camping leader, right?

12:32.766 --> 12:34.166
‐ Oh, sure.
‐ Oh.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.533
You never said
a truer thing, yes.

12:35.566 --> 12:37.233
Lead on, lead on.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.033
Well, I was just checking.

12:41.133 --> 12:42.466
‐ Bye‐Bye.
‐ Bye.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.133
You don't think she noticed
anything wrong, do you?

12:49.533 --> 12:51.166
No, no.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.233
I think she probably
sees two men

12:53.266 --> 12:55.733
wearing a sleeping bag
each and every day.

12:57.433 --> 12:59.466
Small setback,
small setback.

13:01.500 --> 13:06.033
But this is still going to be
the greatest camping trip ever.

13:06.066 --> 13:09.266
Cousin, wake up
and smell the propane.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.433
We're trapped and we haven't
even left the apartment yet.

13:14.466 --> 13:16.400
[instrumental music]

13:21.500 --> 13:24.066
[instrumental music]

13:27.633 --> 13:31.400
Alright, everybody
in my group over here!

13:31.433 --> 13:33.300
Gather 'round
the picnic table!

13:33.333 --> 13:35.233
Now, I'd like to take
this opportunity

13:35.266 --> 13:37.566
to point out that the tip
for the group leader

13:37.600 --> 13:40.133
is not included
in the price of the trip.

13:42.133 --> 13:43.633
Are you gonna wear
that all weekend?

13:43.666 --> 13:46.266
I'm starting
to get a migraine.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.566
If there are any hunters
in the woods

13:48.600 --> 13:50.366
I wanna make sure
they see me.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.733
See you?

13:51.766 --> 13:53.266
Hang a couple of lights
on your butt

13:53.300 --> 13:55.000
and airplanes
will land on your back!

13:57.733 --> 13:59.566
Why do you always
do that to me?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.566
'Why do you undermine
my self‐confidence..'

14:04.066 --> 14:07.033
Oh, Mary Anne,
isn't this wonderful?

14:07.066 --> 14:08.166
This is great.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.366
I haven't camped out
since...since..

14:12.733 --> 14:16.066
...well, I guess
I've never camped out.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.466
Now, remember, campers,
this is not a zoo.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.733
Do not pet or feed
the animals.

14:20.766 --> 14:23.033
This is their home.
Try to respect that.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.600
Larry, come on.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.533
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.033
[grunting]

14:30.066 --> 14:32.200
Larry, are you sure you don't
want any help with that?

14:32.233 --> 14:34.566
Oh, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.166
If I can't carry twice
my body weight in camping gear

14:37.200 --> 14:39.233
I don't deserve
to go camping.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.533
Uh, now, can I have
your attention?

14:42.566 --> 14:45.333
All Chronicle campers,
please go down the path

14:45.366 --> 14:47.733
to the corral
where you'll be given a mule

14:47.766 --> 14:49.333
'to take you to the campsite.'

14:49.366 --> 14:52.233
'And remember,
those mules can bite.'

14:52.266 --> 14:53.233
[laughing]

14:58.800 --> 15:00.033
Aren't you guys coming?

15:00.066 --> 15:02.633
Oh, you go ahead.
We'll catch up.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.700
Balki, we need to talk.

15:05.533 --> 15:07.466
[panting]

15:10.833 --> 15:12.733
Did you see
the girl's faces

15:12.766 --> 15:14.766
when the man
mentioned mules?

15:16.233 --> 15:18.533
No, cousin,
I was being a good listener.

15:20.333 --> 15:24.100
Well, I did.
They were not happy campers.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.100
Well, Cousin, how else we're
gonna get to the campsite?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.100
Oh, huh.

15:27.133 --> 15:28.233
Oh! Look!

15:29.133 --> 15:30.633
'Rafts!'

15:30.666 --> 15:33.066
Well, Balki,
this is perfect!

15:33.100 --> 15:35.600
The campsite is right
on the river.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.766
We'll rent a raft,
the river

15:37.800 --> 15:40.166
will take us slowly
to the campsite

15:40.200 --> 15:42.300
what could be
more romantic?

15:42.333 --> 15:44.500
Shearing a sheep
with the woman you love?

15:47.366 --> 15:49.366
But that's not the point.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.300
The point is,
as leader

15:51.333 --> 15:54.266
I veto the rafts
and I go for the mules.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.600
Balki, Balki, I‐I..

15:57.633 --> 16:00.233
...I didn't wanna bring
this up before

16:00.266 --> 16:03.366
uh, because you were doing so
well as leader, but technically

16:03.400 --> 16:07.600
technically,
your leadership doesn't begin

16:07.633 --> 16:10.300
until we
get to the campsite.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.266
You‐You never
mentioned that.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.466
Well, I didn't think
it was necessary.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.600
It's implied in the term
"Camping leader."

16:16.633 --> 16:17.600
"Camping leader!"

16:18.733 --> 16:21.333
When we get
to the campsite

16:21.366 --> 16:23.566
the camping leader,
that's you..

16:23.600 --> 16:27.800
...will be in charge
of the camping.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.633
But it is my responsibility
to get us there.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.500
Wow!

16:35.566 --> 16:39.400
I had no idea there was such
a subtle division of leadership.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.133
Well, now, you do.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.133
Follow me.

16:44.433 --> 16:47.166
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.033
We'd like to rent a raft,
large enough for four.

16:50.066 --> 16:51.600
Okay.

16:51.633 --> 16:54.066
That's $30 a day
for the raft.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.333
Are you guys
gonna need a guide?

16:55.366 --> 16:56.333
‐ No.
‐ Yes.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.300
‐ Excuse us.
‐ Certainly.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.100
What, uh..

17:05.233 --> 17:06.566
What are you doing?

17:06.599 --> 17:07.766
Well, Cousin, I‐I thought
it might be nice

17:07.800 --> 17:09.433
to‐to take a guide.

17:09.465 --> 17:12.333
Balki, we don't need a guide
to take us down the river.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.566
Pay attention.

17:16.266 --> 17:19.566
The river only goes one way.
It's a one‐way river.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.633
Well, cousin, I think it's a tad
more complicated than that.

17:23.665 --> 17:24.700
‐ Oh, you do?
‐ Yes, I do.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.333
‐ Oh, you do, oh, do you?
‐ Yes, I do, cousin‐‐

17:26.366 --> 17:28.800
Alright. Well, Balki,
let me ask you a question.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.566
How many rivers
have you been on?

17:30.600 --> 17:32.400
How many?
How many rivers?

17:32.433 --> 17:33.466
How many rivers
have you been on

17:33.500 --> 17:35.666
in a rubber raft
in America?

17:35.700 --> 17:36.600
‐ None.
‐ None?

17:36.633 --> 17:38.333
As in zero, as in no rivers
have you been on

17:38.366 --> 17:39.700
in a rubber raft
in America?

17:39.733 --> 17:41.366
‐ That is correct.
‐ Well, I have.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.166
And I say
we don't need a guide.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.133

Look, we sit
in the raft

17:51.500 --> 17:53.633
with Jennifer
and Mary Anne.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.666
The river slowly
takes us to the campsite.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.200
We glide up,
we get out.

17:59.233 --> 18:02.033
‐ I take charge‐‐
‐ Yeah, yeah, sure.

18:02.066 --> 18:05.333
The point is,
everyone will have fun

18:05.366 --> 18:07.033
'cause we'll be rollin'.

18:07.066 --> 18:09.066
‐ Rolling?
‐ Rollin'.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.333
‐ Rolling?
‐ Rollin' on the river.

the best time we have
ever had out of doors.

right, Balki.

has a fork in the road.

we go...left.

Well, that may be what the map
says, but I'm telling you

Mother Nature is whispering in
my ear that we should go right.
