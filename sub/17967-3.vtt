01:19.251 --> 01:20.048
Jeremy!

01:20.149 --> 01:21.880
Hi. Hi.

01:21.981 --> 01:24.277
Uh, I was just gonna see
what you're up to today,

01:24.378 --> 01:26.009
but you're obviously
going to work, so.

01:26.109 --> 01:28.672
This is a joke shirt.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.803
'Cause I'm a trainer. Oh.

01:31.004 --> 01:36.097
Yeah, I sometimes train, um,
VIP clients at night.

01:36.232 --> 01:38.394
Like Shania... Twain.

01:38.529 --> 01:39.393
Wow.

01:39.528 --> 01:41.958
And then I come
back here during the day

01:42.058 --> 01:44.487
and I'm just free to do
whatever happens.

01:44.655 --> 01:47.052
You know... Well, I know we don't
know each other that well,

01:47.219 --> 01:49.316
but I'm heading upstate today
to pick up some

01:49.450 --> 01:51.446
salvaged beams from an
abandoned barn... Oh.

01:51.547 --> 01:54.676
And I was just wondering
if you...

01:54.777 --> 01:56.574
could sign for a package
for me that I'm expecting.

01:56.675 --> 01:57.739
Oh.

01:57.841 --> 01:59.205
I mean, only if you're
going to be home anyway.

01:59.305 --> 02:00.836
Totally, totally.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.068
Amazing, okay.

02:02.168 --> 02:03.099
I'll leave a note on my door

02:03.201 --> 02:04.132
and tell them to
drop it off here.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.831
The window's between
10:00 and 4:00.

02:05.931 --> 02:07.994
Okay. I really appreciate it.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.292
Yeah. I owe you one.

02:10.393 --> 02:12.722
Okay, I love you too.

02:12.824 --> 02:14.520
I'm sorry, did you
just say something?

02:14.621 --> 02:16.884
No, I think that you said...
you said something to me.

02:17.052 --> 02:19.348
Yeah, I said, "Can you sign
for a package for me"

02:19.515 --> 02:20.913
that I'm expecting,"
and then you said...

02:21.047 --> 02:23.610
And then I didn't...
I don't think I said anything.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.607
You're hearing things, man.
I might be.

02:25.708 --> 02:27.672
You better get those beams.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.481
You can sign for the package, though, right?
I can totally do that.

02:30.503 --> 02:33.132
Okay. Great signature.

02:33.267 --> 02:35.130
All right, love you too.

02:35.231 --> 02:36.662
Oh, my God.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.788
Ilana?

02:43.921 --> 02:45.318
Hey, Ilana.

02:46.885 --> 02:48.249
What?

02:48.416 --> 02:49.413
What time is it?

02:49.581 --> 02:51.578
Were you just sleeping
with your eyes open?

02:51.713 --> 02:52.810
No.

02:52.944 --> 02:54.542
Of course not.

02:54.642 --> 02:58.836
Um, that would take, like,
super long to perfect.

02:58.937 --> 03:00.102
Computer's not on.

03:00.202 --> 03:01.733
It's just idle, I think.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.464
It's not on.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.890
Look, I need you to read and
sign the employee manual.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.721
Details a lot of
the workplace policies.

03:12.822 --> 03:17.483
One of them is, um,
proper workplace attire.

03:17.583 --> 03:18.681
Oh, okay.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.845
Well, I can just cover this.

03:20.946 --> 03:22.909
Oops.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.308
Oop.

03:24.442 --> 03:27.138
"Sophie's Choice."

03:27.239 --> 03:28.470
Hey.

03:28.571 --> 03:30.468
It also details our sexual
harassment policies.

03:30.569 --> 03:31.467
Got it.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.120
Got it, got it, got it,
got it, got it.

03:33.165 --> 03:34.030
Cool.

03:34.164 --> 03:36.627
Um, well, I will get
right on that, sire.

03:36.761 --> 03:39.957
But first, I'm going to take my
top-o'-the-morning-dump-to-you.

03:40.057 --> 03:42.454
So um, I'll see you in a
couple... Couple hours.

03:43.721 --> 03:45.683
Yeah, you know, it started
as a sore throat,

03:45.784 --> 03:48.314
<i>but I'm feeling
really feverish now.</i>

03:48.448 --> 03:50.611
It's escalating quickly.

03:50.746 --> 03:53.141
A clump of my hair
just fell out actually.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.740
Somebody had an accident
in the steam room

03:54.874 --> 03:56.471
and I kind of want
you to handle that.

03:56.605 --> 03:58.036
It's getting worse
as we're talking.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.901
All right,
let's wheelbarrow, come on.

04:00.035 --> 04:01.632
I really think
I should stay home.

04:01.766 --> 04:03.697
Fine, take the day off, but
this is what I want you to do.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.926
Run a quick 5K, sweat it out,
then take an eight-minute nap.

04:07.061 --> 04:08.691
Wake up,
do a shot of Echinacea,

04:08.792 --> 04:10.588
and then jump right
into an ice bath.

04:10.690 --> 04:13.153
Immediately after that,
suck on some ice chips,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.949
then urinate as
hard and as fast as you can.

04:16.051 --> 04:18.546
<i>Then eat a full onion, rub that
onion underneath your armpits,</i>

04:18.647 --> 04:21.144
any kind of gland, any kind
of mucal cavity, okay?

04:21.244 --> 04:23.107
It's called cellular confusion.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.305
All right, back on
that bench, let's go!

04:25.407 --> 04:27.469
I'll give that a try
if I can muscle it.

04:27.637 --> 04:29.101
And then you just gotta veg.

04:29.201 --> 04:30.699
They just put all of
"Smallville" on Netflix.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.697
But Abbi, promise me you'll
watch from the beginning, okay?

04:32.798 --> 04:33.862
It really builds.

04:33.963 --> 04:36.559
Thanks, Trey. No problem,
Bob, feel better.

04:36.726 --> 04:39.323
All right, you want your ass
tight for reunion or what?

04:39.490 --> 04:40.588
Finish strong.

04:40.722 --> 04:42.153
Nice work, Gloria.

04:42.254 --> 04:44.051
All right, hit the showers.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.649
Okay.

04:47.514 --> 04:49.112
Join me in the showers.

04:49.246 --> 04:50.943
I'm not on my period.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.067
Hello? Ilana Wexler?

04:59.201 --> 05:00.466
Maybe... Who is this?

05:00.599 --> 05:02.696
It's Linda Lodi, from the
Linda Lodi temp agency.

05:02.831 --> 05:05.360
Listen, um, I know we haven't
called you in since that whole.

05:05.461 --> 05:07.558
Popsicle incident.
I totally forgot about that.

05:07.691 --> 05:09.988
Would you be available for some
temp work this afternoon?

05:10.089 --> 05:12.119
Uh...

05:12.220 --> 05:13.984
yeah, I'm available.

05:14.118 --> 05:15.948
<i>Great, just come over
as soon as you can.</i>

05:21.276 --> 05:22.773
Ilana, listen, this delivery
window starts in like,

05:22.908 --> 05:24.339
20 minutes, I really gotta go.

05:24.505 --> 05:25.338
Okay, one last thing.

05:25.504 --> 05:26.868
Dude, this is huge.

05:27.003 --> 05:28.200
Not that big of a deal.

05:28.368 --> 05:29.533
Once you get this package,
he's going to think of you

05:29.666 --> 05:31.830
as someone he can
trust with his mail.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.595
Next thing you know, you're
pregnant with his sperm

05:33.696 --> 05:36.358
and he's sanding down
your headboard shirtless.

05:36.459 --> 05:37.957
I mean, I don't know if I'd
get pregnant like, right away.

05:38.123 --> 05:40.020
I've heard from like, lots of
women that the sex gets bad

05:40.121 --> 05:41.952
after you have kids. Totally.

05:42.053 --> 05:43.783
We haven't even had sex once.

05:43.884 --> 05:45.415
I just want to, like,
make sure we do it enough

05:45.548 --> 05:47.445
before I would have
a kid, you know?

05:50.310 --> 05:52.706
Even if it didn't happen
exactly like that, like,

05:52.807 --> 05:54.437
I think this was
a huge step for us for real,

05:54.538 --> 05:56.535
because he said he owes me one.

05:56.636 --> 05:58.799
Owes you one?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.664
His dick, dude!

06:00.765 --> 06:01.763
You think so?

06:01.864 --> 06:03.727
Oh, he's gonna thank you.

06:03.827 --> 06:05.858
So wear that candy thong
I got you from Spencer's.

06:05.959 --> 06:07.822
You ate it like, as soon as
you gave it to me.

06:07.924 --> 06:09.620
Listen, I really gotta go.
I gotta let you go, sweetie.

06:09.721 --> 06:11.652
I'm about to start
at this temp job... Bye bye.

06:15.248 --> 06:15.947
Sorry.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.178
I had to take that.

06:17.346 --> 06:19.909
You made that call in the
middle of our conversation.

06:20.043 --> 06:21.240
Did I?

06:21.341 --> 06:23.504
I'm really scraping the bottom
of the barrel here.

06:23.639 --> 06:25.519
Look, my whole staff
is out with food poisoning.

06:25.570 --> 06:28.165
I took them to lunch, that sushi
place underneath Penn Station.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.298
Oh, I love that place.

06:29.399 --> 06:30.930
Yeah, it's usually good, right?

06:31.030 --> 06:33.227
Anyway, look, when a call comes
in, just check the database,

06:33.327 --> 06:34.825
send out the first person
available,

06:34.926 --> 06:35.824
and that's pretty much it.

06:35.925 --> 06:36.890
Got it? Yeah.

06:36.991 --> 06:38.288
Okay, I'm going to
leave you on your own.

06:38.389 --> 06:39.620
I gotta go get my hair fixed.

06:39.721 --> 06:41.584
Yeah, what happened there?

06:41.685 --> 06:42.749
I tried this new stylist.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.348
I said, "Do whatever you want."

06:44.449 --> 06:46.645
I am way too trusting
of strangers.

06:46.746 --> 06:48.409
Anyway, here's the keys.

06:48.511 --> 06:49.941
I'll catch you later, okay?

06:50.042 --> 06:51.340
Good luck. Bye.

07:02.994 --> 07:04.525
Are you okay?

07:11.451 --> 07:14.913
Is a forever thing.

07:15.013 --> 07:17.177
Hey, Bevers, you hear
the door knock earlier?

07:17.278 --> 07:19.208
Mm-hmm.
Why didn't you answer it?

07:19.309 --> 07:20.739
I know you don't like me
to answer the door

07:20.841 --> 07:23.436
because I don't
technically live here.

07:23.537 --> 07:24.769
Yeah, you don't
technically live here,

07:24.902 --> 07:27.631
but when I'm not home,
feel free to answer the door.

07:27.732 --> 07:28.972
It could be something
important.

07:28.998 --> 07:30.495
Okay, now we've
worked that out.

07:30.596 --> 07:31.461
Yeah, great.

07:31.562 --> 07:32.959
<i>Hi, thanks for holding.</i>

07:33.060 --> 07:35.460
So your package is still on the
truck, but you can pick it up

07:35.524 --> 07:37.587
from the distribution center
after 4:30.

07:37.688 --> 07:38.952
I'm just confused.

07:39.053 --> 07:43.580
Why was the package delivered at
9:49 when the delivery window

07:43.681 --> 07:45.078
was supposed to start at 10:00?

07:45.180 --> 07:46.810
It's a flexible window.

07:46.911 --> 07:48.075
Windows are never flexible.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.673
That's not how they work.
Sorry.

07:49.774 --> 07:52.171
Your borough's
distribution center is on.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.468
North Brother Island.
Is that in New York?

07:54.569 --> 07:55.769
I've never even heard of that.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.099
Yes, in the East River.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.296
<i>Take the 6 train
to the last stop</i>

07:59.397 --> 08:01.893
and transfer to the M83 bus
to the water taxi.

08:01.994 --> 08:04.091
Boom, you're there.
Thank you, I guess?

08:04.191 --> 08:05.655
You'll never
get off the island.

08:05.756 --> 08:07.120
What did you just say?
I'm sorry.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.819
I'm watching "Shutter Island."

08:08.919 --> 08:10.517
Good luck.

08:26.533 --> 08:27.997
What up?

08:28.097 --> 08:29.396
<i>Is this Linda?</i>

08:29.496 --> 08:30.627
No, I'm just a temp.

08:30.728 --> 08:33.424
<i>You're a temp at a temp agency?</i>

08:33.525 --> 08:35.054
Touche.

08:35.155 --> 08:37.053
<i>What up?
This is Wet Nose Walkers.</i>

08:37.254 --> 08:39.616
<i>We need a temp to cover one
of our dog walker routes.</i>

08:39.784 --> 08:42.313
Absolutely, sir,
that's what we do best.

08:42.448 --> 08:44.778
Um...

08:44.945 --> 08:46.842
What's the address?

08:51.004 --> 08:53.102
Yeah!

08:53.203 --> 08:56.131
I'm making bank, bitch!

08:56.232 --> 08:57.097
Oh, my God.

08:57.198 --> 08:58.662
You are insane.

08:58.763 --> 09:02.224
Ab, I'm becoming a mogul a la
Jay-Z, a la Martha Stewart,

09:02.325 --> 09:03.723
a la Bethenny Frankel.

09:03.824 --> 09:04.888
From "Housewives"? Yeah.

09:04.989 --> 09:06.519
Next thing you know, I'm
backstage at Barclays

09:06.620 --> 09:07.951
with RiRi and Bebe... Who?

09:08.052 --> 09:09.150
Rihanna and Beyonce.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.314
And we're just laughing
and sipping on champagne

09:11.415 --> 09:13.656
with like, candlelight. 'Cause
that happens all the time.

09:13.713 --> 09:16.009
RiRi leans in for a kiss
and then she...

09:16.110 --> 09:18.173
Goes down on you. Yeah.

09:18.274 --> 09:20.371
Yeah, you... you say
that story a lot.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.935
Oh... cool.

09:22.036 --> 09:24.167
Oh, my God!

09:24.267 --> 09:26.797
I didn't know you had plans with Lincoln.
We don't have plans.

09:26.898 --> 09:28.494
We're just going to have sex at
one of these dogs' apartments.

09:28.595 --> 09:30.093
Super classy.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.258
I'd do it.

09:31.359 --> 09:32.879
I'd pick up your poop,
you're worth it.

09:32.924 --> 09:34.621
So I know why I missed
the window.

09:34.722 --> 09:36.242
I jinxed myself.
Why, what do you mean?

09:36.321 --> 09:37.651
'Cause I bought
too many condoms.

09:37.752 --> 09:38.849
It's the story of my life,

09:38.950 --> 09:40.348
so just gonna deal with it.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.609
But I won't make out with you.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.334
That's what white people do,
that dog thing.

09:43.379 --> 09:44.743
Black people don't
make out with dogs.

09:44.843 --> 09:46.563
So what do you think is in
Jeremy's package?

09:46.642 --> 09:47.640
Oh, look at you.

09:47.740 --> 09:48.772
You're standoffish, huh?

09:48.873 --> 09:50.969
I've narrowed it down
to a bunch of things.

09:51.070 --> 09:52.634
I made a little list here.

09:52.735 --> 09:54.798
Okay, so I think it's either,
um, clues to a mystery

09:54.966 --> 09:56.863
that he's gonna solve,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.993
a manly handcrafted axe,

09:59.094 --> 10:01.225
or a really great belt.

10:01.325 --> 10:03.555
Nah, dude, it's a Fleshlight.

10:03.689 --> 10:04.920
Ilana, why do you have to
ruin him for me?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.119
It's not a Fleshlight.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.117
It's healthy.

10:08.218 --> 10:09.482
I gotta head back
to the office.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.212
One of these dumb kids broke
his jaw on a Jawbreaker.

10:12.313 --> 10:13.477
Why would you even do that?

10:13.578 --> 10:15.807
It does exactly what
it says it's gonna do.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.939
Lincoln, you gave all these dogs
all your love and now you're

10:18.040 --> 10:19.437
leaving me like, tight and dry.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.235
I'll kick it with you later.
Okay, cool.

10:21.336 --> 10:22.567
See you later, General Tso.

10:22.735 --> 10:23.798
Is that his name?

10:23.899 --> 10:25.130
Yeah, I name them based on
their personalities.

10:25.231 --> 10:28.327
There's General Tso,
there's Dumbface.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.125
That's Ballsack,

10:30.226 --> 10:33.388
and that is star
of "Ugly Betty"

10:33.489 --> 10:34.952
and "Who's the Boss?"

10:35.053 --> 10:38.748
The wonderful, the esteemed...

10:38.849 --> 10:40.047
Judith Light!

10:40.214 --> 10:42.211
Oh, my God.

10:42.312 --> 10:43.509
She is!

10:43.611 --> 10:45.474
That's so Judith!
That is dead on!

10:45.575 --> 10:46.540
All right,
I'll see y'all later.

10:46.641 --> 10:48.171
All right, peace.
Later, Judith.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.002
Judith, now that I know that
you are Judith Light,

10:50.136 --> 10:52.200
I can't let you back
in that tiny-ass apartment.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.665
We'll drop these bitches off

10:53.765 --> 10:56.062
and you're chilling with me all day.

11:02.956 --> 11:04.396
<i>Last stop in Manhattan.</i>

11:04.453 --> 11:06.550
<i>The train will now be going
express to 37th Street.</i>

11:06.651 --> 11:07.815
Sorry.

11:08.848 --> 11:09.846
Oh.

11:09.981 --> 11:11.412
All right.

12:10.179 --> 12:12.975
Uh, hello...

12:13.076 --> 12:14.406
Garol.

12:14.508 --> 12:16.109
I'm not sure if I'm in
the right place...

12:16.139 --> 12:19.001
You are. Okay.

12:19.102 --> 12:20.700
I'll just hand that...
All right.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.726
Oh, Jesus.

12:26.827 --> 12:27.758
Thank you so much.

12:27.859 --> 12:30.455
It took me so long... ID.

12:30.623 --> 12:32.186
Jeremy Santos.

12:32.287 --> 12:35.083
No, I'm not a man.

12:35.184 --> 12:39.312
Jeremy's actually my...
he's my husband.

12:39.413 --> 12:40.244
So.

12:40.345 --> 12:41.376
We both work so much.

12:41.477 --> 12:42.508
You know how it is.

12:42.676 --> 12:44.439
But when we're home,
we're home and we...

12:44.540 --> 12:48.601
I need his ID or he can
come down here

12:48.669 --> 12:52.330
with two pieces of
mail with his name on it.

12:52.431 --> 12:56.792
Gar... ol, you seem like,
so great.

12:56.892 --> 12:59.355
I can just tell
from this interaction.

12:59.457 --> 13:01.853
Can you just like, look
the other way this time?

13:01.954 --> 13:04.184
I'm sorry, I can't.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.614
My supervisor's watching.

13:10.477 --> 13:13.273
I'm sorry, I will have someone
there right away.

13:13.374 --> 13:14.971
Linda Lodi Temp Agency,
please hold.

13:15.073 --> 13:17.002
Hey. Where have you been?

13:17.103 --> 13:19.033
I've got no temps sent out,
I've got the phone ringing

13:19.134 --> 13:20.798
off the hook, I'm getting
threatening e-mails.

13:20.899 --> 13:22.762
My scalp is burning.

13:24.395 --> 13:25.326
What are you doing?

13:25.460 --> 13:26.541
Have you been eating those?

13:26.592 --> 13:28.123
Yeah. How many have you had?

13:28.224 --> 13:30.021
30 or like, 100.

13:30.121 --> 13:32.118
30 or 100?

13:32.286 --> 13:35.049
These are for a guess-
how-many contest!

13:35.150 --> 13:36.471
Well, you should
label every side.

13:36.481 --> 13:38.561
Well, now I have to count
the whole thing over again.

13:38.612 --> 13:39.772
I don't believe this.

13:39.844 --> 13:41.284
You don't even know
how many you had?

13:41.309 --> 13:43.938
Jesus, what a day.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.102
One, two, three, four, five.

13:46.203 --> 13:47.701
Ten. Six, seven,
eight, nine, 10.

13:47.802 --> 13:51.530
15... five, six, seven, eight, nine...
17, 18...

13:51.631 --> 13:52.529
You're messing me up.

13:52.629 --> 13:54.693
Now I have to start over.

13:54.794 --> 13:56.823
One, two, three, four, five.

13:57.823 --> 14:00.353
Oh, my God, I killed her!

14:00.488 --> 14:02.684
Judith Light!

14:03.751 --> 14:04.848
59, 60.

14:08.911 --> 14:10.109
<i>Hello? Bevers.</i>

14:10.210 --> 14:12.739
I need you to steal two pieces
of Jeremy's mail from like,

14:12.840 --> 14:15.070
the front hall and bring them
to North Brother Island

14:15.170 --> 14:16.868
like, immediately, okay?

14:17.002 --> 14:18.532
And then you're going to
have to pretend to be him.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.131
I'd love to,
but I'm actually out

14:20.231 --> 14:21.862
with some friends right now.

14:21.963 --> 14:23.194
You're not in the apartment?

14:23.295 --> 14:24.659
No, we're on the same schedule.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.457
If you're not there,
I'm not there.

14:26.558 --> 14:28.388
<i>When you're there, I'm there.</i>

14:28.556 --> 14:29.820
Okay, just shut up, listen.

14:29.921 --> 14:33.415
If you do this for me
right now, I'm gonna...

14:33.516 --> 14:36.912
I will buy you a
Costco rotisserie chicken.

14:37.013 --> 14:38.177
Uh, sold.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.574
I'll head over as soon
as I finish my mimosa.

14:40.675 --> 14:42.006
Okay.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.571
Jesus Christ.

14:46.835 --> 14:47.865
Hi.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.297
Oh, my God, Judith.

14:49.398 --> 14:51.429
We induced vomiting,
he's gonna be fine.

14:51.530 --> 14:52.860
He? Yeah.

14:52.962 --> 14:53.926
Oh, my God.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.957
I looked for his dick forever.

14:56.058 --> 14:57.189
All that hair.

14:57.289 --> 15:00.052
Well, he's probably
stressed from the day.

15:00.153 --> 15:02.050
Do you guys have dog Xanax?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.448
For him, Judith Light.

15:03.549 --> 15:05.309
We do, but I don't think
it's necessary. Cool.

15:05.347 --> 15:07.877
If I wrapped it up in a piece
of cheese for him to eat

15:07.978 --> 15:10.873
and then I accidentally
swallowed that piece of cheese,

15:10.974 --> 15:14.169
would I die or
be like, super chill?

15:14.337 --> 15:16.401
I'm not going to prescribe
you dog Xanax.

15:16.501 --> 15:17.865
Oh, no.

15:17.966 --> 15:19.164
No, I didn't mean... No.

15:19.264 --> 15:21.661
I see how... No, no, no.

15:21.762 --> 15:22.693
Cool.

15:22.794 --> 15:25.090
One last quick "Q."

15:25.191 --> 15:28.587
Um, are human hemorrhoids
the same as dog hemorrhoids,

15:28.687 --> 15:31.850
and if so, does dog
hemorrhoid cream work

15:31.950 --> 15:34.413
on human buttholes?

15:38.743 --> 15:40.339
No.

15:43.271 --> 15:45.167
Yeah, I got here
as soon as I could.

15:45.269 --> 15:46.999
How did you get a cab
to come here?

15:47.100 --> 15:50.029
The Whitestone Bridge
is right over there.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.227
Okay, come on, let's go.

15:51.362 --> 15:53.691
Do you have 70 bucks
to pay the driver?

15:55.457 --> 15:57.554
Remember, you're my husband,
Jeremy Santos.

15:57.687 --> 15:58.319
Right.

15:58.420 --> 15:59.751
Got it.

15:59.886 --> 16:03.680
I'm not your roommate's
boyfriend, I'm your husband.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.178
Don't worry.

16:05.279 --> 16:06.444
I'll do it good. Okay.

16:06.544 --> 16:09.341
But don't tell Melody.
Tell Melody what?

16:13.071 --> 16:14.500
Oh, God.

16:16.733 --> 16:19.362
That was a great...

16:19.496 --> 16:21.293
that was a great kiss
from my husband.

16:21.428 --> 16:22.558
Garol, hi.

16:22.693 --> 16:25.888
So this is Jeremy, my husband
I told you about earlier.

16:26.022 --> 16:29.284
You're Jeremy Santos.

16:29.385 --> 16:31.515
No, I'm Matty Bevers.

16:34.846 --> 16:36.243
No, Abbi, don't!

16:36.377 --> 16:38.308
No, no, no, I'm gonna
lose a flip flop!

16:38.408 --> 16:40.638
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

16:40.738 --> 16:41.938
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:41.971 --> 16:44.267
No, no, no, no!

16:44.368 --> 16:48.529
Chicken!

16:51.626 --> 16:53.490
Oh... hey.

16:53.624 --> 16:55.754
You know, it's really not cool
to have such a big dog

16:55.855 --> 16:57.286
in such a
tiny apartment all day.

16:57.387 --> 16:59.650
It's irresponsible,
to tell you the truth.

16:59.751 --> 17:01.748
That is not my dog. Hmm?

17:01.881 --> 17:04.310
My dog is a teacup Yorkie
named Cherish.

17:04.412 --> 17:07.607
Where is Cherish? Huh, right.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.637
If the Yorkie belongs here, then
the retriever should have gone

17:10.738 --> 17:12.635
to the place
above the liquor store.

17:15.833 --> 17:16.829
I see what I did.

17:16.998 --> 17:18.529
This is so me, dude.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.659
All the dogs are off by one.

17:20.794 --> 17:21.758
Oh, my God.

17:21.893 --> 17:23.257
The Chihuahua should
be the in the loft.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.619
Which means you should be
in Chinatown, Judith Light.

17:26.752 --> 17:27.751
Oh, man.

17:27.886 --> 17:29.716
No worries, dude,
Cherish is totally fine.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.846
She's just in a tenement
building on Avenue D.

17:31.947 --> 17:34.643
I'll have her back in one...
closer to three hours.

17:37.674 --> 17:40.171
Cherish!

17:44.167 --> 17:45.397
No, Mom, it was good.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.896
Yeah, it was good.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.558
I actually drew today, all day.

17:50.659 --> 17:51.891
I gotta go... I love you.

17:52.024 --> 17:53.355
Okay, talk to you later, bye.

17:54.422 --> 17:55.819
Abbi, it's fine.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.751
I just think
you owe me an apology.

17:57.852 --> 17:58.883
Are you kidding me?

17:58.983 --> 18:00.014
You owe me an apology.

18:00.116 --> 18:02.679
Well, you did ruin
a perfectly good chicken.

18:02.812 --> 18:04.510
It's a rotisserie chicken.

18:04.643 --> 18:07.173
You can get one anywhere. What
does it matter how it's prepared?

18:07.274 --> 18:08.338
You know what, Bevers?

18:08.439 --> 18:09.803
You need to like,
just shut up right now

18:09.904 --> 18:11.184
because I can't even
handle this.

18:11.336 --> 18:13.666
You got me to commit
a federal offense today.

18:13.834 --> 18:17.029
We borrowed neighbor's mail
to go get a neighbor's package.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.327
You were not a good kisser.

18:18.462 --> 18:20.725
You messed up
my entire thing today.

18:20.826 --> 18:23.122
I think we should talk.
We're talking right now.

18:23.322 --> 18:25.419
I think what needs to
happen is you need to go home

18:25.554 --> 18:27.250
'cause you don't live here.
What?

18:27.351 --> 18:29.048
You need to
grab all your little flip flops

18:29.149 --> 18:31.146
and all your socks
and you need to get out.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.542
Jesus, what?

18:34.643 --> 18:36.573
Whoa. Jeremy.

18:36.674 --> 18:38.238
Okay, I don't have the package.

18:38.405 --> 18:39.336
I don't have it.

18:39.471 --> 18:41.134
They came here and then
I wasn't here and then

18:41.235 --> 18:42.833
I had to go to
the island to get it

18:42.934 --> 18:44.531
and there was this woman there
and she was eating all this

18:44.632 --> 18:46.096
yogurt and she
wouldn't give it to me 'cause

18:46.197 --> 18:47.361
I didn't have your ID.
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

18:47.462 --> 18:49.892
I don't have an ID of yours.
It's okay.

18:50.059 --> 18:51.290
I'm sorry. It's not her fault.

18:51.457 --> 18:52.455
It's mine.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.453
I didn't get the door
when the delivery came.

18:54.554 --> 18:57.849
Abbi actually tried really hard
to get your package today.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.547
Abbi, I didn't mean for you
to go through so much trouble.

18:59.715 --> 19:00.713
It's no big deal.

19:00.813 --> 19:04.175
Listen, man, I'm going to
be here all day tomorrow

19:04.276 --> 19:06.073
and the day after that,
all day.

19:06.174 --> 19:07.837
Day after that, all day.

19:08.039 --> 19:10.568
So I can sign for
your package, no problem.

19:10.702 --> 19:12.299
Fantastic, man,
I appreciate that.

19:12.434 --> 19:15.295
I owe you dinner, okay? Oh,
you don't... Yeah, okay.

19:15.397 --> 19:18.426
It'll be fun. I got a lot of
planks I gotta unload, so...

19:18.593 --> 19:19.824
All right. But I'll
see you guys later?

19:19.959 --> 19:20.956
Yeah. Okay.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.688
Just whenever.

19:26.418 --> 19:28.148
I thought he would never leave.

19:28.249 --> 19:29.879
Ooh.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.676
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

19:32.777 --> 19:34.907
Thank God you got this
toilet paper, Abbi.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.871
Ooh...

19:36.972 --> 19:39.469
Oh, I totally missed, Abbi!

19:39.570 --> 19:40.700
Oh!

19:43.232 --> 19:44.630
The graphics are sick.

19:44.731 --> 19:45.861
You can really see like,
the life

19:45.996 --> 19:48.459
drain out of the guy's
eyes... It's pretty cool.

19:48.559 --> 19:50.823
I'd love to come over and
play sometime. I wish.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.620
Abbi really doesn't like it
when I have friends over.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.817
I'll come to your place?
Absolutely.

19:55.918 --> 19:58.014
I'll make my special
rotisserie chicken.

19:58.148 --> 19:59.812
21 seasonings salute.

19:59.913 --> 20:00.911
Dude.

20:01.079 --> 20:02.476
How are you still single?

20:02.577 --> 20:05.006
It's just hard to meet
girls in this city.

20:05.174 --> 20:07.237
Dude, you gotta know
someone you can set me up with.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.599
You know what?

20:13.731 --> 20:16.260
No, I don't.

20:16.394 --> 20:17.392
Sorry.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.318
So this mole has grown like, 10
times bigger in the last year.

20:24.419 --> 20:25.950
Should I be worried? Please.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.113
There's a cat I need
to put to sleep.

20:28.214 --> 20:30.377
Okay, but could you just
touch it really quickly?

20:30.512 --> 20:32.175
Am I thin?

20:32.276 --> 20:33.241
Like, for a dog?

20:33.375 --> 20:35.738
Well, the cat's dead.

20:35.838 --> 20:37.137
Let's do this.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.667
Wow, these hemorrhoids
really are bad.

20:39.768 --> 20:40.799
I know.

20:40.967 --> 20:42.830
I spend way too much
time on the toilet.

20:42.931 --> 20:43.962
Thanks.

20:44.063 --> 20:45.394
You know, I just can't
even control myself.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.825
Well, this should do the trick.

20:46.927 --> 20:48.590
Now remember, no scratching.

20:50.123 --> 20:51.487
Thanks again.
