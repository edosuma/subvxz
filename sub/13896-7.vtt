[MAL] FOR THE LOVE
OF GOD, JAKE,

00:05.540 --> 00:07.050
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:07.090 --> 00:09.010
NOTHING, B'Y.
I JUST NEED A FEW PAINKILLERS.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.130
EXCUSE ME, PARDON ME.

00:10.170 --> 00:12.340
HOW MANY MORNINGS A WEEK
DO YOU WAKE UP HUNG OVER?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.890
WILL YOU STOP BEING
SUCH AN OLD WOMAN?

00:14.930 --> 00:16.640
MAYBE A COFFEE
WOULD DO, ACTUALLY.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.140
YOU NEED A KICK IN THE ASS,
NOT A COFFEE.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.600
YOU GOTTA GET
YOUR ACT TOGETHER, JAKE.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.730
IT'S GETTING'
OUTTA HAND. REALLY!

00:21.770 --> 00:24.400
LOOK, WHY ARE YOU
SO INTERESTED IN MY LIFE
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

00:24.440 --> 00:26.270
IS MY LIFE
THAT FASCINATING TO YOU?

00:26.310 --> 00:28.270
NO. JUST HARD TO LOOK AWAY
FROM A TRAIN WRECK.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.110
AH, MALACHY DOYLE.

00:30.150 --> 00:31.240
PROFESSOR SULLIVAN.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.360
CALL ME CALVIN.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.240
-HOW ARE YA, B'Y?
-THIS IS MY SON, JAKE.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.490
WHO DO YOU WANT US TO PUNCH?

00:35.530 --> 00:37.410
WHAT HE MEANS IS,
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

00:37.450 --> 00:39.240
I THINK SOMEONE'S
AFTER MY WIFE.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.540
SHE'S BEING HARASSED OR WORSE.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.000
BRAKES WENT OUT ON HER CAR,

00:43.040 --> 00:44.460
THE RAILING AT
THE HOUSE GAVE WAY.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.710
THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.250
-I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE ACCIDENTS.
-REALLY?

00:47.290 --> 00:50.420
OH, CALVIN,
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T.

00:50.460 --> 00:53.090
THIS IS MY WIFE, JENNIFER,
THE ESTEEMED DR. SULLIVAN.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.800
-HI.
-HI.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.220
MY HUSBAND HAS
A NOVELIST'S IMAGINATION.

00:57.260 --> 01:00.600
I THINK HE JUST WANTED
THE CHANCE TO MEET SOME
REAL PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.730
SO, YOU DON'T THINK THAT
ANYONE'S REALLY HARASSING YOU?

01:02.770 --> 01:04.020
IT'S WORSE THAN HARASSMENT.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.940
REALLY, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.690
[DR. NG] IT IS MY GREAT HONOR

-SOMETHING'S WRONG.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.340
THOUGH I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY

02:53.380 --> 02:55.420
I'M STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.800
THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.010
SO, WAS THAT A HALLUCINATION
YOU WERE HAVING?

02:59.050 --> 03:02.350
SEEMS I'VE DISCOVERED
A NASTY INTERACTION
BETWEEN MEDICATIONS.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.100
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
COME ON!

03:04.140 --> 03:06.020

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.150
E.R. SAYS IT WAS AN OVERDOSE.

03:13.190 --> 03:14.520
-OF WHAT?
-I DON'T KNOW YET.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.320
THEY'RE RUNNIN' A BLOOD TEST.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.320
I NEED YOU GUYS TO FIGURE OUT
WHO'S DOING THIS BEFORE
ANYTHING WORSE HAPPENS.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.240
TWO DOCTORS SHE WORKS WITH
AT THE PRACTICE.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.450
THEIR PROFESSIONAL
RIVALRIES, JEALOUSY.

03:23.490 --> 03:25.700
BUT THESE ARE THE TWO DOCTORS
SHE THANKED IN HER SPEECH.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.040
BUT THAT'S ALL AN ACT.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.040
DR. NG AND ELLEN,
THEY HATE EACH OTHER AND HER.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.620
THEY'RE TWO-FACED.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.250
THAT CAN HAPPEN
WHEN YOU WORK WITH SOMEONE
FOR A LONG TIME. TRUST ME.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.170
LISTEN, WE'LL GET
RIGHT ON THIS. NO WORRIES.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.380
THANKS.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.300
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

03:47.310 --> 03:49.350
MALACHY!
DON'T FREAK OUT, OKAY?

03:49.390 --> 03:50.520
-HEY DARLING.
-HI.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.100
-SO...
-WHY WOULD I FREAK OUT?

03:53.440 --> 03:55.060
BECAUSE UH...

03:55.110 --> 03:56.190
THERE HE IS!

03:56.230 --> 03:57.940
MALACHY, HOW'S IT HANGIN'?

03:57.980 --> 03:59.320
GET OUTTA MY HOUSE!

03:59.360 --> 04:01.450
MALACHY, YOUR HEART!
YOUR HEART!

04:01.490 --> 04:03.410
-STAY AWAY FROM ME!
-HEY, HEY, HEY, EASY!

04:03.450 --> 04:04.740
I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY
FROM US AND I MEANT IT.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.410
YOU GOT ME ALL WRONG, HERE.
I'M JUST HERE TO HELP!

04:06.450 --> 04:07.870
WE DON'T WANT YOUR HELP!

04:07.910 --> 04:10.540
I WAS JUST THINKING,
"HOW CAN I THANK THESE TWO?"

04:11.410 --> 04:12.500
THAT'S ALL I WAS THINKING.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.710
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
FAMILY NOW.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.380
WELL, WE'RE DISOWNING YOU.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.800
&lt;SIGHS&gt; LOOK AT THIS FACE,
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

04:17.840 --> 04:19.960
COME ON.
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.220
I'M HAPPY! CAN'T YOU SEE IT?
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

04:22.260 --> 04:23.380
AND I OWE IT ALL TO YOU TWO.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.260
-REALLY?
-YEAH!

04:25.300 --> 04:26.720
I'VE GOT SOME CASH NOW.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.470
HIT A NICE LITTLE INVESTMENT
DEAL UP THERE,

04:28.510 --> 04:30.140
IN MONTREAL. PRETTY SWEET.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.810
WHAT HE'S SAYING IS,
HE BET ALL HIS MONEY ON
THE FIGHTS AND HE WON.

04:31.850 --> 04:34.100
WHEN I GOT WORD BACK THAT...

04:34.150 --> 04:36.690
YOU GUYS ARE
IN THIS LITTLE JAM,
IN A SPOT UP HERE.

04:36.730 --> 04:38.360
-WHAT SPOT?
-WHAT GAME ARE YOU
PLAYING NOW, MARTIN?

04:38.400 --> 04:41.690
OH, NO. THEY HAVEN'T SAID
A WORD TO YOU TWO.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.700
UNBELIEVABLE. WELL,
DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.950
LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS TRAVEL ALL THE WAY
TO NEWFOUNDLAND

04:45.990 --> 04:47.410
TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.580
WHY CHANGE NOW?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.410
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
I SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDDLED.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.370
SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT MY
BIG FAT MOUTH SHUT!

04:53.410 --> 04:55.120
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU SIT YOUR BOYS DOWN,

04:55.170 --> 04:57.540
YOU ASK 'EM WHAT THEY'RE INTO,
THEN YOU COME AND SEE ME.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.340
AND I PROVIDE
THE SOLUTION, OKAY?

04:59.380 --> 05:00.380
-GET OUT.
-TRUST ME.

05:00.420 --> 05:01.800
DON'T TRUST YOU. GET OUT.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.880
YOU ACTUALLY KIND OF
NEED MY HELP THIS TIME.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.550
GO. DON'T COME BACK.

05:05.590 --> 05:07.510
SO, I'LL HEAR FROM YOU?

05:07.550 --> 05:09.680
-AND I MEAN IT!
-JAKE AND CHRISTIAN...

05:09.720 --> 05:12.730
-IS HE MESSING WITH US?
-MALACHY, I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.520
I'M JUST SORRY I BROUGHT HIM
INTO YOUR LIFE.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.230
-DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU OKAY?
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;

05:16.980 --> 05:18.360
-YEAH, FINE.
-YOU SURE?

05:18.400 --> 05:19.940
&lt;SIGHS&gt; I'M FINE!

05:24.490 --> 05:25.610
-HI.
-HI.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.990
I WAS STAKIN' OUT
YOUR HOTEL FOR DAYS

05:29.030 --> 05:30.370
AND YOU NEVER CAME HOME, SO...

05:30.410 --> 05:32.250
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S KIND OF CREEPY, NO?

05:32.290 --> 05:33.870
WELL, YEAH, I GUESS.
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

05:33.910 --> 05:35.580
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOT ONLY DID YOU

05:35.620 --> 05:37.630
RUIN A DEPOSITION FOR ME,
PROFESSIONALLY,

05:37.670 --> 05:40.960
BUT YOU LEFT ME STANDING
HALF-NAKED IN YOUR APARTMENT.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.510
YOU KNOW WHAT, JAKE,
I THINK THIS IS GOODBYE.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.470
NO, NO. JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND, OKAY?

05:45.510 --> 05:46.550
LET ME EXPLAIN.

05:48.430 --> 05:51.470

A FRIEND OF MINE GOT... SHOT.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.980
AND UH...
I HAD TO TAKE OFF.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.640
AND I KNOW IT WAS WRONG OF ME
TO, UH, NOT TELL YOU.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.400
TO LEAVE YOU THERE LIKE THAT.
I KNOW THAT AND I'M SORRY.

06:01.150 --> 06:02.530
-IT'S STILL GOODBYE, JAKE.
-HEY.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.780
-HI.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.490
&lt;CAR SENSOR TURNS OFF&gt;

06:08.530 --> 06:10.030
ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.620
LET ME TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.240
THAT WOULD HAVE
TO BE SOME DINNER.

06:15.450 --> 06:16.620
I'M NOT SAYIN' NO.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.250
&lt;CAR ENGINE TURNS ON&gt;

06:26.590 --> 06:27.880

06:27.930 --> 06:29.590
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.800
SOUNDS SERIOUS.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.580
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

07:01.170 --> 07:02.210
YEAH.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.550
SOMEONE RATTLIN' MY CAGE.
SORRY.

07:06.590 --> 07:09.970

07:10.550 --> 07:11.760
&lt;DOOR BUZZING&gt;

07:11.800 --> 07:13.680
[JAKE] SO, DR. SULLIVAN,

07:13.720 --> 07:15.720
SHE'S HAD 3 ALLEGED
ATTEMPTS ON HER LIFE...

07:15.770 --> 07:17.680
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU!

07:17.730 --> 07:18.560
ABOUT WHAT?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.900
-I DON'T KNOW YET.
-[JAKE] THAT'S DEEP.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.520
DO YOU MIND IF WE KEEP
WORKING WHILE YOU SEARCH
FOR INNER MEANING?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.190
-SUSPECTS?
-UH, WELL, LET'S SEE,

07:26.230 --> 07:28.860
WE'VE GOT
DR. NG AND DR. ELLEN.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.660
HAVEN'T GOT MUCH
ON THIS GUY YET.
HE'S SOME KIND OF RESEARCHER.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.820
DR. ONE-NAME HERE...

07:32.870 --> 07:34.080
SHE REALLY GOES BY ONE NAME?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.490
YEAH, YEAH! LIKE DR. PHIL!

07:36.870 --> 07:38.160
OH, I... WHICH I DON'T WATCH.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.790
I JUST SAW CLIPS
ONLINE ONE TIME. UH...

07:40.830 --> 07:42.920
IT'S OKAY.
"DR. ELLEN AND THE INNER EGO."

07:42.960 --> 07:44.790
OH, YEAH! SULLIVAN WROTE
A REVIEW ON IT. CHECK IT!

07:44.840 --> 07:46.050
-IT'S RIGHT...
-SORRY, SORRY.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.010
UH, "PSYCHIATRY,

07:48.050 --> 07:51.050
"AN UNFORGETTABLE ART,
ONE FORGETTABLE BOOK."
TALK ABOUT A HEADLINE.

07:51.090 --> 07:53.680
-IT'S A BIT HARSH.
-NOT REALLY,
IT'S A CRAPPY BOOK.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.640
I READ IT. AND, SHE HAS
ANOTHER ONE COMING OUT
IN ABOUT A MONTH.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.270
SO, WHAT? SHE TRIES
TO KILL SULLIVAN BECAUSE
SHE'S AFRAID OF A BAD REVIEW?

08:00.310 --> 08:01.520
IT SEEMS A LITTLE EXTREME.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.850
SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
ALLERGIC TO CRITICISM.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.110
ME, I ACTUALLY
REALLY ENJOY IT.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.440
AND THEN THERE'S
JOSEPH OTIS, EX-COP.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.030
I KNOW I RECOGNIZED HIM.
SKULKIN' AROUND THE CEREMONY.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.990
I KNEW HIM YEARS AGO.

08:12.030 --> 08:13.740
HE WAS UNDERCOVER WITH
A BUNCH OF DRUG DEALERS

08:13.780 --> 08:15.320
AND PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING IN TOO DEEP.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.490
SO? WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH SULLIVAN?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.080
UH, WELL, THEY SENT HIM
TO SEE SULLIVAN

08:19.120 --> 08:21.620
AND SHE RECOMMENDED HE BE
TAKEN OFF THE FORCE.

08:21.660 --> 08:22.710
HONORABLE DISCHARGE.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.250
NOW, THAT SPEAKS TO A MOTIVE.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.540
-DO YOU HAVE
AN ADDRESS ON THIS GUY?
- YEAH, WORKIN' ON IT.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.130
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

08:30.170 --> 08:31.720
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.720
-PARANOID MUCH?
-&lt;TELEPHONE RINGING&gt;

08:34.090 --> 08:35.930
HEY THERE.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.350
HOW YOU DOIN'?
ARE YOU, UH, ARE YOU
BACK TO WORK, YET?

08:37.390 --> 08:39.890
YES, FIRST DAY, TODAY.
I START THIS AFTERNOON.

08:39.930 --> 08:41.640
GREAT. SO WHAT?
COP GETS SHOT,

08:41.680 --> 08:43.640
THEY DON'T SEND 'EM ON
AN ALL-INCLUSIVE TO CUBA?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.400
NOT WHEN IT
BARELY LEAVES A SCAR.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.110
I UH... I WANTED
TO TALK TO YA.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.030
OKAY. UM...

08:50.070 --> 08:51.820
-EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
-[LESLIE] YEAH, I WANTED TO...

08:51.860 --> 08:54.410
STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT WITH US.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.370
I DON'T WANT TO BE
SENDING YA MIXED SIGNALS.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.580
SOUNDS PRETTY COMPLICATED.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.580
NO, IT'S NOT. NOT WITH ME.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.460
WELL, I GUESS
IT ISN'T FOR ME, EITHER, THEN.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.830
GOOD. IT'S ALL
I WANTED TO KNOW.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.630
SO, WE'RE FRIENDS.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.050
COLLEAGUES,
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT. OKAY?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.010
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; ALL RIGHT.

09:12.130 --> 09:13.340
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.760
[DES] OKAY, SO...

09:18.800 --> 09:20.470
IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF
HER PATIENTS, RIGHT?

09:20.510 --> 09:23.350
AND DUE TO DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY,

09:23.390 --> 09:24.560
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PHOTOS.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
BUT, IMAGINE, IF YOU WILL,

09:26.650 --> 09:31.150
A POSSIBLE PSYCHOTIC,
CRAZED KILLER ON OUR HANDS

09:31.190 --> 09:32.780
AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.410
I'M GOING TO GO UNDERCOVER,
IN AS A PATIENT.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.780
EXCELLENT IDEA.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.240
TERRIFIC!

09:39.280 --> 09:40.660
YEAH, I THIRD THAT MOTION.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.670
&lt;♪&gt;

09:47.750 --> 09:49.670
YOU HAD ME AT REFERRAL.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.630
I'VE BEEN DYING TO DO THIS
PRACTICALLY SINCE WE MET.

09:51.670 --> 09:52.920
[JAKE] OH, WELL...

09:52.960 --> 09:54.760
THANKS FOR THE BOOST
OF CONFIDENCE.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.180
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS
PROBABLY JUST FOR A CASE,

09:56.220 --> 09:57.930
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

09:57.970 --> 09:59.760
FIGURE OUT YOUR WEIRD
RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.220
I DON'T HAVE A WEIRD
RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.440
A COMPLEX, MAYBE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.360
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM OFF. LIKE, FREAKED.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.610
I'M NOT FREAKED.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.440
WE WERE MARRIED. I KNOW
YOU FREAKED WHEN I SEE IT.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.490
[JAKE] I'M FINE.

10:15.530 --> 10:18.700
LOOK, SOONER OR LATER,
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.740
I THINK YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.830
-REALLY?
-LOOK AFTER YOURSELF, OKAY?

10:22.870 --> 10:23.790
AND HAVE FUN WITH THE SHRINK.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.160
THANKS.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.420
YES, PROFESSOR SULLIVAN,
I WILL ORDER THEM RIGHT AWAY.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.500
I'M GLAD, TOO.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.970
SO SORRY. THAT WAS ONE
OF OUR DOCTOR'S HUSBANDS.

10:38.010 --> 10:40.180
SHE'S SICK AND HE WANTS ME
TO ORDER FLOWERS.

10:40.220 --> 10:43.180
I GUESS EVEN DOCTORS GET SICK
FROM TIME TO TIME, RIGHT?

10:43.220 --> 10:45.810
HMM. DR. ELLEN'S READY
TO SEE YOU, MR. DOYLE.

10:45.850 --> 10:47.850
-DO YOU WANT SOME TEA?
-UH, NOPE.

10:47.890 --> 10:49.810
JUST SYMPATHY. &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

10:49.850 --> 10:52.610
IT'S A JOKE.
TEA AND SYMPATHY,
IT'S A BOOK, RIGHT?

10:52.650 --> 10:54.940
YEAH. I GOT IT.
I WAS AN ENGLISH MAJOR.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.700
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; THANKS.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.990
[DR. ELLEN] MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE.

10:59.030 --> 11:00.320
YOU CAN LIE ON
THE COUCH IF YOU LIKE.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.530
I'M UH...

11:02.950 --> 11:04.240
I'M COMFORTABLE.

11:04.950 --> 11:07.330
&lt;SIGHING&gt; RELAX.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.580
OH, I'M, UH...

11:09.920 --> 11:11.670
PHEW, RELAXED.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.960
WHY HAVE YOU COME
TO SEE ME TODAY?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.380
ALL RIGHT, WELL...
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; MONEY.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.380
YOU KNOW, AND WOMEN.
WOMEN, MOSTLY.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.970
I JUST WENT THROUGH A DIVORCE
A WHILE BACK.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.300
AND, UH, I THINK I'M IN LOVE
WITH A COP WHO...

11:23.350 --> 11:26.770
WAS JUST SHOT AND
I'M SEEING THIS OTHER WOMAN
WHO'S... AMAZING.

11:26.810 --> 11:28.480
IN FACT, ALL THREE OF THEM,

11:28.520 --> 11:30.900
ARE FAR, FAR, FAR
TOO GOOD FOR ME.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.480
IT'S A LOT.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.520
IT'S A LOT TO BE
CARRYING ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.730
THIS ACTUALLY FEELS
A LOT BETTER THAN
I EVER THOUGHT IT WOULD.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.950
YOU KNOW, JUST
TALKING LIKE THIS.
I DON'T USUALLY GET A CHANCE.

11:39.990 --> 11:40.910
&lt;EXHALES&gt;

11:41.700 --> 11:42.820
MY BROTHER...

11:42.870 --> 11:44.120
HE BORROWED A BUNCH OF MONEY
FROM A LOAN SHARK,

11:44.160 --> 11:45.870
AND NOW, I THINK MY...

11:45.910 --> 11:47.080
MY FATHER,
HE'S SNIFFING AROUND.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.250
I THINK HE'S GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.120
ALL YOU NEED TO REMEMBER...

11:50.160 --> 11:51.830
IS TO THINK OF NOTHING...

11:51.870 --> 11:53.710
BUT YOURSELF.

11:53.750 --> 11:54.920
SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT, NOW?

11:54.960 --> 11:56.130
SELF-LOVE.

11:56.170 --> 11:58.340
ARE YOU SAYING THAT I SHOULD
PLAY WITH MYSELF MORE?

11:58.380 --> 12:00.010
PUT YOURSELF BEFORE OTHERS.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.550
THAT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE
TERRIBLE ADVICE.

12:02.590 --> 12:04.010
NO, IT'S NOT. TRUST ME.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.850
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; I'D LIKE TO.

12:05.890 --> 12:08.560
BUT, MAYBE I SHOULD GO
SEE ANOTHER DOCTOR.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.850
YOU KNOW?
MAYBE ONE IN THIS CLINIC.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.940
DR. SULLIVAN, MAYBE?

12:12.980 --> 12:16.070
I HEAR SHE'S THE BEST
PSYCHIATRIST IN THE WORLD.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.860
OKAY, YOU CAN GO SEE
ANOTHER DOCTOR, IF MY ADVICE
DOESN'T SUIT YOU. SURE.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.200
THAT'S BIG OF YOU,
BECAUSE I STUMBLED UPON THIS.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.570
A REVIEW OF YOUR BOOK
BY DR. SULLIVAN.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.370
"PSYCHIATRY,
AN UNFORGETTABLE ART,

12:26.410 --> 12:28.120
"ONE FORGETTABLE BOOK."

12:28.160 --> 12:30.120
DOESN'T THAT JUST
MAKE YOU WANNA... KILL HER?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.670
WHY... WHY WOULD YOU
BRING THAT UP?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.420
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
DR. SULLIVAN'S APPROVAL?

12:35.460 --> 12:37.670
DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR FATHER'S APPROVAL?

12:37.710 --> 12:40.760
-THAT HE LOVES
YOUR BROTHER MORE?
- GOD, NO. IT'S EASIER.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.720
THAT WAY, I HAVE LESS
OF A DISTANCE TO FALL.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.300
AND WE ALL FALL EVENTUALLY.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.590
OKAY, WHY HAVE YOU
REALLY COME HERE?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.260
-[JOSEPH] DON'T LIE TO ME!
-[CINDY] SHE ISN'T HERE!

12:47.300 --> 12:49.220
-[JOSEPH] STOP LYING TO ME!
-SHE'S NOT HERE!

12:49.270 --> 12:51.430
THEY SAID SHE LEFT
THE HOSPITAL TO COME HERE!

12:51.480 --> 12:53.640
-SHE ISN'T IN, TODAY!
- WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON OUT HERE?

12:53.690 --> 12:54.810
[JOSEPH] DON'T LIE TO ME.

12:54.850 --> 12:56.480
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.820
OKAY...

12:57.860 --> 12:59.400
BUDDY, LET'S JUST DO WHAT
THE GIRL SAYS, ALL RIGHT?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.990
OR WHAT? YOU JUST STAY
OUT OF THIS!
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!

13:02.030 --> 13:04.240
-CINDY, CALL SECURITY.
-NO, DON'T DO THAT!

13:04.950 --> 13:05.990
JOSEPH!

13:07.370 --> 13:09.160
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.870
I LEAVE YOU MESSAGES AND
YOU DON'T RETURN MY CALLS?

13:11.910 --> 13:13.870
CALM DOWN. IT'S OKAY.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.380
JOSEPH, I'M... I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T CALL YOU,

13:17.420 --> 13:21.010
BUT WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS
BEFORE AND YOU HAVE TO
RESPECT BOUNDARIES.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.510
IF YOU DON'T WATCH IT,
SOMETHING BAD IS GOING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.050
OKAY! THAT'S ENOUGH!

13:28.100 --> 13:30.560
JOSEPH, I'M GOING TO HAVE
CINDY CALL YOU
AND SET UP A MEETING.

13:31.850 --> 13:34.520
IF YOU DON'T WATCH IT,
SOMETHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOU

13:34.560 --> 13:36.350
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO STOP IT.

13:38.190 --> 13:39.570
SHOULD I CALL CALVIN?

13:39.610 --> 13:42.230
NO, NO. CINDY,
THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL CALL MY HUSBAND.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.150
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A BREAK AND, UM,
CLEAR MY SCHEDULE.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.580
[MAL] I DON'T KNOW,
I TALKED TO CHRISTIAN,

13:52.620 --> 13:53.870
BUT HE'S SUCH A TERRIBLE LIAR.

13:53.910 --> 13:55.250
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S HIDING?

13:55.290 --> 13:57.370
WELL, DON'T LET
YOUR IMAGINATION
GET THE BEST OF YOU.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.750
NOW THERE'S
WHAT YOU LIKE TO SEE,
A HAPPY COUPLE.

13:59.790 --> 14:01.090
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GETTIN' BACK TO ME.

14:01.130 --> 14:03.050
MAYBE I'M THINKIN'
MY PHONE'S BROKEN.

14:03.090 --> 14:04.720
-MARTIN, THIS IS STARTIN'
TO GET REALLY OLD.
-YEAH.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.930
-GO AWAY.
-WE'RE DONE WITH YOU.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.340
WE DON'T WANT TO
HAVE TO TELL YOU AGAIN.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.760
&lt;SIGHS&gt; I'M NOT LOOKIN'
TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE HERE.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.890
STOP PLAYING
GAMES WITH US, MARTIN,

14:10.930 --> 14:11.970
I'M STARTIN'
TO LOSE MY PATIENCE.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.020
SEE, YOUR SONS AREN'T
TALKIN' TO YA, ARE THEY?

14:14.060 --> 14:15.560
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL JAMMED UP.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.100
AND IT WAS NOT ME
THAT LED THEM DOWN
THIS PATH TO TEMPTATION.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.810
THEY DID THAT ON THEIR OWN.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.520
I'M JUST HERE TO HELP.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.280
YOU WANT ME TO BITE? FINE.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.450
WHAT ARE THEY INTO?

14:26.490 --> 14:28.570
WAIT, DO YOU KNOW,
UH, LITTLE SKINNY RAT?

14:28.610 --> 14:31.240
UH, A 6 TO 5 GUY,
GOES BY "BIG FAT RONNIE"?

14:32.990 --> 14:34.540
&lt;EXHALES DEEPLY&gt;

14:34.580 --> 14:36.750
BAR. THE DOWN PAYMENT.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.330
-HOW MUCH?
-40.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.920
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYIN',
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY,

14:39.960 --> 14:42.090
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THIS MONEY STRAIGHT OUT.

14:42.130 --> 14:45.090
THERE'S NO STRINGS, HERE.
NO INTEREST, NO NOTHIN'.

14:45.130 --> 14:47.300
CALL IT A "THANK YOU."
CALL IT "I'M SORRY."

14:47.340 --> 14:49.050
I DON'T CARE, OKAY?

14:49.090 --> 14:50.430
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
PAY ME BACK.

14:50.470 --> 14:53.600
YOU KNOW WHAT, MARTIN?
MY SONS ARE
THE IDIOTS, NOT ME.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.810
-I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
-I'M ON THE LEVEL HERE.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.560
ROSE, YOU TELL HIM.
UNBELIEVABLE.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.560
YOU GONNA EXPLAIN THAT
LITTLE OUTBURST JUST NOW?

15:01.610 --> 15:04.230
OH, JOSEPH...

15:04.270 --> 15:07.860
REALLY, I'M NOT AT LIBERTY
TO DISCUSS ANY OF MY PATIENTS,
MR. DOYLE.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.030
RIGHT.

15:10.530 --> 15:14.410
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; WEREN'T YOU
THE DOCTOR
RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVING...

15:14.450 --> 15:17.040
JOSEPH REMOVED FROM THE FORCE?

15:17.080 --> 15:19.370
HE'S GOING THROUGH
A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.920
NOW, I KNOW MY HUSBAND
ASKED YOU TO LOOK INTO THINGS.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.130
BUT REALLY...

15:25.340 --> 15:26.590
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:27.420 --> 15:29.380
ME? WHAT ABOUT ME?

15:29.430 --> 15:31.300
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
A HARD TIME.

15:31.340 --> 15:33.140
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; WELL, THANK YOU.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.850
I'M FINE, ACTUALLY.

15:34.890 --> 15:38.270
YOU KNOW, CINDY'S CANCELED
ALL MY APPOINTMENTS
TODAY, ALREADY.

15:38.310 --> 15:40.060
-WE COULD TALK.
-YOU AND ME?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.730
-MMM-HMM.
-TALK-TALK?

15:41.770 --> 15:44.570
-MMM-HMM!
-I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON
THE TASK AT HAND, DON'T YOU?

15:44.610 --> 15:47.610
YOU'RE AFRAID TO OPEN
THE VAULT TO THE
INNER WORKINGS OF JAKE DOYLE.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.610
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.740
WELL, I THINK IT'S BETTER
THAT WE NEVER FIND OUT,
DON'T YOU?

15:53.780 --> 15:55.160
HOW 'BOUT SOME TEA?

15:55.660 --> 15:57.200
IT'S CALMING.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.500
WE CAN JUST SIT FOR A BIT.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.250
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

16:01.290 --> 16:04.710
I KNOW TEA WILL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER. REALLY.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.130
HOW LONG HAVE YOU,
UH, HAVE YOU BEEN
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.090
A FEW YEARS.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.840
I WAS A COP FOR A BIT
BEFORE THAT.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.930
-A SMALL BIT.
-HMM.

16:15.970 --> 16:18.600
AND... AND CALVIN SAYS THAT
YOU WORK WITH YOUR FATHER.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.020
WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

16:20.060 --> 16:21.100
IT'S FINE.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.100
-FINE?
-YEAH, FINE.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.270
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS,
BUT I LOVE HIM.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.610
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?

16:27.650 --> 16:30.190
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS A KID.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.320
IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE TROUBLE
TRUSTING WOMEN?

16:32.360 --> 16:35.070
OH, I DON'T THINK
MY PROBLEM WITH WOMEN
IS NOT TRUSTING THEM.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.290
OH, SHOOT, I FORGOT
TO PLUG IN THE KETTLE.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.870
PLEASE, ALLOW ME.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.040
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE JUST DEMONSTRATING
THAT YOU LIKE TO HELP.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.130
PARTICULARLY WOMEN,
I WOULD THINK.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.800
AND YOU'RE AVOIDING
THE CONVERSATION.

16:49.590 --> 16:51.670
OH, NO, DOCTOR.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.550
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
AVOIDING THE CONVERSATION.

16:54.590 --> 16:56.930
-SOMEONE'S TRYING TO HURT YOU.
-YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.140
THERE IS NOBODY TRYING
TO DO ANYTHING TO ME.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.560
&lt;ELECTRICAL BUZZING&gt;

17:02.270 --> 17:04.690
OH, MY GOD! JAKE!
LOOK AT ME.
CAN YOU LOOK AT ME?

17:04.730 --> 17:06.360
CINDY? CINDY!

17:08.610 --> 17:10.610
[MAL] WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
PLAYIN' WITH ELECTRICITY?

17:10.650 --> 17:13.280
HE WAS ALWAYS
STICKING HIS FINGERS
IN SOCKETS AS A KID.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.280
LOOK DAD, I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS NO ACCIDENT,
ALL RIGHT?

17:15.320 --> 17:17.070
SOMEBODY RIGGED THAT OUTLET
WITH A CHARGE.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.120
-JAKE...
-ROSE TRACKED DOWN JOE OTIS,

17:19.160 --> 17:20.490
HER EX-DRUG COP.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.700
-HE'S AN ELECTRICIAN, NOW.
-REALLY?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.580
SO, FIRST HE TRIES
TO DRUG SULLIVAN,

17:24.620 --> 17:26.460
THEN WHAT?
HE TRIES TO ELECTROCUTE HER?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.250
-JAKE!
-WE SHOULD CALL THE COPS.

17:28.290 --> 17:29.210
WELL, WE COULD GO TO THE COPS,

17:29.250 --> 17:31.260
EXCEPT FOR YOU KNOW,
SULLIVAN WON'T EVEN ADMIT

17:31.300 --> 17:32.710
THAT ANY OF THIS
IS HAPPENING. PLEASE!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.170
IF YOU MADE
A STRONGER CONNECTION
WITH THAT CURRENT...

17:34.220 --> 17:35.430
I'D HAVE SUPER-POWERS, NOW?

17:37.720 --> 17:38.760
THANK YOU.

17:39.470 --> 17:41.100
YOU SURE HE'S OKAY?

17:41.140 --> 17:42.350
[NIKKI] DON'T WORRY, MAL.
HE'LL BE FINE.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.140
HE CAN HANDLE A LITTLE STRESS?

17:44.180 --> 17:46.310
YOU ARE SO SWEET,
THE WAY YOU WORRY ABOUT HIM.

17:46.350 --> 17:47.980
HE'S FINE. HE'S 100%.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.190
THANKS, NIKKI.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.120
SO, BOTH MY SONS ARE UP TO
THEIR ARMPITS IN DEBT,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
-TO A CRIMINAL?
-JUST...

18:00.200 --> 18:02.240
-CALM DOWN.
- I WILL NOT CALM DOWN!

18:02.290 --> 18:03.290
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

18:04.410 --> 18:06.830
YOU BORROWED $40,000
FROM A LOAN SHARK.

18:06.870 --> 18:08.040
YOU'RE A MORON!

18:08.080 --> 18:10.210
AND YOU DRAGGED
CHRISTIAN INTO THIS?

18:10.250 --> 18:13.130
-WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS?
-DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

18:13.170 --> 18:15.090
YOU ACT LIKE
THIS IS NO BIG DEAL.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.220
RONNIE MIGHT BE SMALL-TIME,

18:16.260 --> 18:18.260
BUT IF THIS DEBT
GETS TOO LARGE,

18:18.300 --> 18:19.890
IF YOU STOP PAYING
THE INTEREST,

18:19.930 --> 18:21.680
HE'LL GET REAL HEAVY,
REAL FAST.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.100
THEN I'LL HAVE TO
DEAL WITH IT ALL.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.770
LOOK, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THE REAL STORY
IS HERE, OKAY?

18:25.810 --> 18:27.850
SO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
I GOT IT COVERED.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.610
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.690
WOULD YOU JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE CREDIT HERE, PLEASE?
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

18:33.400 --> 18:34.940
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, SO...

18:34.990 --> 18:36.110
STAY THE HELL OUT OF IT.

18:38.910 --> 18:39.950
&lt;EXHALES&gt;

18:42.620 --> 18:44.200
-&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;
-[ROSE] HEY, GOOD TIMING.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.080
GUYS, BLOOD WORK'S
IN ON SULLIVAN.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.290
SHE WAS DRUGGED WITH
AN LSD-LIKE SUBSTANCE.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.330
PLUS, SULLIVAN AND...
&lt;STUTTERING&gt; THE... THE...

18:50.380 --> 18:52.170
-[ROSE] NG.
-[DES] NG.

18:52.210 --> 18:55.260
UH, THEY'RE CO-OWNERS OF
A NEW PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC DRUG
THAT HE'S DEVELOPING.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.840
THEY WERE EXPERIMENTING
WITH HALLUCINOGENS FOR
PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.380
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HIT
THE MARKET MONTHS AGO.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.300
SO? WHY DIDN'T IT?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.510
BECAUSE DR. SULLIVAN
CALLED FOR NEW TRIALS.

19:02.550 --> 19:05.060
SO, NG WAS SET TO MAKE
A TRUCKLOAD OF CASH

19:05.100 --> 19:07.140
AND SHE WAS THE ONLY THING
STANDING IN HIS WAY.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.810
AND IF DR. SULLIVAN WERE TO
MEET WITH A TRAGIC ACCIDENT,

19:09.850 --> 19:12.060
SAY, AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE...

19:12.110 --> 19:15.690
HE'D BE CLEAR OF HER AND
HE COULD PUSH THE DRUG THROUGH
AND GET RICH.

19:15.730 --> 19:17.490
WHAT ABOUT, UH,
DR. ELLEN, HERE?

19:17.530 --> 19:20.030
OH, YEAH, I GOT
HER LAST NAME, HERE. IT'S UH,

19:20.070 --> 19:22.450
GRE-KOR-VRES-KIN-KOV.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.990
GREKORVRESKI... SOMEONE
NEEDS TO BUY A VOWEL!

19:28.960 --> 19:30.250
LOOK INTO HER. ALL RIGHT?

19:30.290 --> 19:32.540
APPARENTLY,
SULLIVAN'S QUESTIONING
HER PROFESSIONALISM.

19:32.580 --> 19:33.750
I'LL CHECK OUT NG.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.550
-MAN, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.
-[MAL] YEAH.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.380
SOMEONE NEARLY SENT
ENOUGH VOLTS THROUGH HIM

19:37.420 --> 19:39.340
TO KNOCK SOME SENSE
INTO HIS BIG, FAT HEAD.

19:39.380 --> 19:40.550
[JAKE] UGH! LOOK,
DO ME A FAVOR, ALL RIGHT?

19:40.590 --> 19:43.010
YOU GO SEE
THE EX-COP-TURNED-ELECTRICIAN.

19:43.050 --> 19:44.970
HE'S STILL MY
NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.020
FOR RIGGIN' THAT
FRIGGIN' OUTLET.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.480
I DON'T LIKE PLUGGIN'
ANYTHING IN.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.730
I'VE ACTUALLY AIR-DRIED
MY HAIR FOR YEARS
FOR THAT VERY REASON.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.360
TRY IT. IT WORKS, OBVIOUSLY.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.530
HEY, HEY! IT'S 5:00 SOMEWHERE.
I WOULDN'T SAY NO.

20:00.570 --> 20:02.070
-HUH?
-YEAH, BUT I WOULD.

20:02.820 --> 20:03.870
OKAY.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.380
&lt;FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING&gt;

20:20.050 --> 20:21.260
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?

20:22.720 --> 20:24.090
UH...

20:24.140 --> 20:26.260
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.680
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; SORRY, I...

20:28.770 --> 20:30.390
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
THE DRILL, YOU KNOW?

20:30.730 --> 20:31.770
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

20:33.520 --> 20:34.980
HOW ARE YOU?

20:35.020 --> 20:37.150
I DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY PERSONAL LIFE
WITH MY PATIENTS.

20:39.230 --> 20:40.610
I HAVE SOME ISSUES, YOU KNOW?

20:40.650 --> 20:41.900
FAMILY ISSUES, MOSTLY.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.820
MORON BROTHER ISSUES
MORE TO THE POINT.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.740
-RIGHT.
-SOMEHOW, I ENDED UP
WITH UH, A BIG LOAN

20:46.780 --> 20:49.160
WITH A BUNCH OF LOAN SHARKS...
WELL, A LOAN SHARK, ACTUALLY

20:49.200 --> 20:51.580
OKAY. I'M GONNA
STOP YOU THERE.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.540
I'M NOT REALLY
THAT KIND OF DOCTOR.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.670
THE, UH, "LET'S TALK
ABOUT OUR FEELINGS" KIND.

20:56.710 --> 20:59.500
I CONCENTRATE MORE
ON PHARMACEUTICAL THERAPY.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.340
WELL, I'M NOT THAT INTO DRUGS.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.340
WELL, I'M SURE THERE'S
MEDICATION THAT CAN HELP YOU.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.050
&lt;JAKE SIGHS&gt;

21:06.090 --> 21:08.850
DO YOU EVER WORRY
ABOUT MONEY, DOCTOR?

21:08.890 --> 21:10.060
I DON'T TALK ABOUT
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.430
WITH YOUR PATIENTS, RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT SULLIVAN?

21:13.190 --> 21:14.520
-EXCUSE ME?
-DR. SULLIVAN.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.520
SHE KNOWS A LOT
ABOUT DRUGS, TOO, RIGHT?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.980
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

21:19.020 --> 21:20.940
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO GET THIS.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.860
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

21:26.530 --> 21:28.160
SHE CAN'T TURN ON US NOW.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.240
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
HER ETHICAL CONCERNS,
SHE'S WRONG!

21:30.290 --> 21:31.330
YEAH... NO... THE DRUG...

21:32.700 --> 21:34.410
I THINK THIS SESSION IS OVER.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.830
CLOSE THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

21:36.790 --> 21:37.830
NO PROBLEMO.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.390
[MAL] JOE?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.470
JOE OTIS?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.430
I'M MALACHY DOYLE.

21:52.470 --> 21:53.680
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.650
WE WERE ON THE FORCE
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.770
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:57.810 --> 21:59.480
I'M A PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR NOW.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.570
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU INVESTIGATING?

22:01.610 --> 22:03.360
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH DR. SULLIVAN?

22:03.400 --> 22:04.740
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
FOLLOWING HER?

22:06.070 --> 22:07.530
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

22:08.570 --> 22:10.240
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN
FOLLOWING HER.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.700
[MAL] I KNOW SHE'S THE REASON
YOU WERE THROWN OFF THE FORCE.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.160
I WASN'T CANNED. I QUIT!

22:17.040 --> 22:18.580
AND I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO'S TRYING TO HURT SULLIVAN.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.050
YOU ASK ME, IT'S ONE OF
THOSE CUT-THROAT DOCTORS
SHE WORKS WITH.

22:23.090 --> 22:25.380
SO, YOU THINK ONE OF THEM
WAS ABLE TO RIG
THE ELECTRICAL OUTLET

22:25.420 --> 22:27.090
IN HER OFFICE
TO ALMOST KILL HER?

22:28.090 --> 22:29.430
MALACHY, ALL DUE RESPECT...

22:30.720 --> 22:32.350
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

22:32.390 --> 22:33.520
STAY OUTTA MY WAY.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.850
&lt;CAR ENGINE STARTS&gt;

22:49.780 --> 22:51.700
-STILL NOT LOCKIN'
YOUR DOORS, HUH?
-&lt;GASPS&gt;

22:51.740 --> 22:54.580
YOU KNOW, WITH
THE ECONOMIC BOOM THAT
THIS TOWN'S EXPERIENCING,

22:54.620 --> 22:57.540
APPARENTLY, CRIME RATES ARE
SUPPOSED TO RISE DRAMATICALLY.

22:57.580 --> 23:00.080
HAVEN'T YOU CAUSED
ENOUGH TROUBLE
IN MY LIFE, MARTIN?

23:00.130 --> 23:01.420
ROSIE... I MEAN, ROSE...

23:01.460 --> 23:03.420
JUST LET ME HELP YOU AND
THE OLD MAN OUT, OKAY?

23:03.460 --> 23:04.960
I ACTUALLY HAVE
HIT IT PRETTY BIG.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.170
I'VE GOT US SET FOR LIFE.
IT'S BIG MONEY.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.630
I DON'T CARE!

23:08.680 --> 23:10.680
GO LIVE YOUR LIFE
IN SOME OTHER ISLAND!

23:10.720 --> 23:12.430
I'M TELLIN' THE TRUTH, HERE.

23:12.470 --> 23:15.970
AND THOSE DOYLE BOYS
ARE HEADED FOR A BIG LOAD OF
NOTHIN' GOOD HEADED THEIR WAY.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.020
I JUST WANNA HELP.

23:18.060 --> 23:22.610
AND I REALIZED THAT, YOU KNOW,
OUR LIVES AREN'T GOING TO BE
AS CLOSELY INTERTWINED AS WHAT

23:22.650 --> 23:23.900
I HAD PREVIOUSLY HOPED FOR.

23:25.230 --> 23:28.490
YOU'RE STILL A... AN IMPORTANT
PERSON IN MY HEART.

23:28.530 --> 23:32.370
AND I KIND OF REALIZED THAT
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
A CROWDED HOUSE IN THERE.

23:32.410 --> 23:33.830
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

23:33.870 --> 23:35.240
-ANYWAY...
-MARTIN...

23:35.290 --> 23:36.450
-GO!
-ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

23:36.490 --> 23:37.910
JUST GET YOUR HUSBAND
TO CALL ME.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.620
CAN YOU DO THAT? OH...

23:39.660 --> 23:41.290
AND JUST SO YA BOTH KNOW,

23:41.330 --> 23:42.790
IT WAS CHRISTIAN
TOOK OUT THE LOAN,

23:42.830 --> 23:46.420
JAKE STEPPED IN
AND SAVED HIS ASS,
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.170
-IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME...
-WHY WOULD I LIE?

23:49.670 --> 23:50.840
SEE YA, SWEET CHEEKS.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.640
[NIKKI] IS THAT YOUR
NEW GUY OUT THERE?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.640
HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE MAYOR.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.350
YEAH, THERE'S
A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE.

23:59.390 --> 24:00.520
HE SEEMS REALLY GREAT.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.560
-HE IS.
-I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.020
THANK YOU.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.480
IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE,
YOU KNOW?

24:07.530 --> 24:09.150
TAKE IT FROM ME.

24:09.190 --> 24:11.610
YOU JUST GOTTA FIND
THE RIGHT PERSON

24:11.660 --> 24:14.620
AND THEN,
ALL OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS,
YOU CAN SUDDENLY DEAL WITH.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.540
IS THAT RIGHT?

24:19.870 --> 24:21.330
YOU'RE GONNA HEAL UP NICELY.

24:21.370 --> 24:22.670
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED
ANY MORE PAINKILLERS

24:22.710 --> 24:24.210
AND I'LL WRITE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION, OKAY?

24:24.250 --> 24:25.540
THANK YOU.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.960
UH, DR. RENHOLDS...

24:27.880 --> 24:28.920
NIKKI.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.050
CAN HE CHANGE, DO YOU THINK?

24:33.590 --> 24:34.680
THE MAYOR?

24:36.720 --> 24:37.810
SORRY, NEVER MIND.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.530
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

24:53.860 --> 24:55.240
&lt;SIGHS&gt; WHAT DID YOU TELL DAD?

24:55.280 --> 24:56.320
NOTHIN'.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.830
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

24:57.870 --> 24:59.410
LOOK, HE'S ONTO US.

24:59.450 --> 25:00.620
"US," YEAH. RIGHT.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.620
AND HE'S MORE THAN
ONTO US, OKAY?

25:02.660 --> 25:03.870
SOMEONE RATTED US OUT.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.460
LUCKILY, HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
YOU WERE THE ONE

25:05.500 --> 25:07.040
WHO WAS STUPID ENOUGH
TO GO SEE THE LOAN SHARK.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.800
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO TAKE ON THAT DEBT, DID I?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.050
I HAD EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

25:11.090 --> 25:12.720
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
SURE YOU DID.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.510
LISTEN, IF HE CORNERS YOU
OR WHATEVER,
JUST TELL HIM THAT...

25:15.550 --> 25:16.850
I'M RESPONSIBLE, OKAY?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.140
AND THAT
I'M TAKING CARE OF IT.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.720
I CAN'T DO THAT.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.440
JAKE, PLEASE STOP
TREATING ME LIKE
I'M A BROKEN BROTHER. PLEASE!

25:23.480 --> 25:24.690
-I GOTTA GO.
-JAKE!

25:26.100 --> 25:27.150
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

25:38.450 --> 25:39.700
&lt;CAR BEEPING&gt;

25:41.660 --> 25:43.200
&lt;CAR ENGINE TURNING ON&gt;

25:46.750 --> 25:48.500
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

25:54.050 --> 25:56.590
-WAIT!
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:56.630 --> 25:59.300
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I SHOULD CALL
THE POLICE ON YOU!

26:06.640 --> 26:08.810
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

26:08.860 --> 26:10.270
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.030
-WERE YOU PLANTING A BOMB?
-A BOMB?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.150
GOD NO!

26:13.190 --> 26:14.610
IT'S A CRUDE LISTENING DEVICE.

26:14.650 --> 26:16.610
FROM LIKE, 1982
BY THE LOOKS OF IT.

26:16.650 --> 26:17.950
I WAS GONNA BUG YOUR CAR.

26:17.990 --> 26:20.280
MAYBE GET SOME DIRT
TO BLACKMAIL YOU
INTO CHANGING YOUR MIND.

26:20.330 --> 26:24.370
WE'RE DEVELOPING A DRUG
THAT QUITE FRANKLY,
HE IS RUSHING TO GET APPROVED.

26:24.410 --> 26:27.620
BUT I WON'T SIGN OFF
ON IT BECAUSE IT'S
NOT READY, WILLIAM!

26:27.670 --> 26:28.830
I REALLY NEED THE MONEY.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.420
I WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE.
BUT I WAS PUSHING IT.

26:31.460 --> 26:32.630
SO, YOU DIDN'T DRUG HER, THEN?

26:32.670 --> 26:34.420
OR RIG THE ELECTRICAL OUTLET?

26:34.460 --> 26:35.920
I CAN BARELY
SCREW IN A LIGHT BULB!

26:35.970 --> 26:37.680
AND I WOULD NEVER GO THAT FAR.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.010
I HOPE WE CAN
PUT THIS BEHIND US.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.600
I'M SORRY.

26:43.350 --> 26:45.140
THANK YOU FOR
LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.390
I APPRECIATE IT, REALLY.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.310
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE
A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION

26:48.350 --> 26:51.440
WITH MY HUSBAND
ABOUT PUTTING AN END
TO ALL OF THIS NONSENSE.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.230
WELL, LET'S HOPE
YOU DON'T GET THROUGH TO HIM.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.820
I THINK SHE'S
HIDING SOMETHING.
AND THERE'S STILL JOE.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.830
HE'S GOT A FULL LOAD OF
RESENTMENT, THAT ONE.

27:01.870 --> 27:02.910
YEAH, HE DOES.

27:03.870 --> 27:04.660
AND UH...

27:05.870 --> 27:07.540
I'M SORRY.

27:07.580 --> 27:08.670
SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.630
I'M SORRY.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.000
I KNOW YOU TRIED TO COVER
FOR CHRISTIAN WITH THE LOAN.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.550
I'M SORRY FOR
BLAMING YOU FIRST.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.590
NO, DAD, YOU WERE RIGHT.
IT WAS...

27:17.630 --> 27:19.380
-IT WAS A STUPID IDEA.
-NO.

27:20.050 --> 27:21.470
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING.

27:21.510 --> 27:22.800
AND AN HONORABLE THING.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.390
WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT, ANYWAY?

27:24.430 --> 27:26.180
-BIG FAT RONNIE?
- MARTIN POOLE.

27:26.220 --> 27:28.180
-HE'S BACK IN TOWN.
-WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.850
ROSE'S EX-HUSBAND
MARTIN POOLE? SERIOUSLY?

27:30.900 --> 27:32.150
HE OFFERED TO COVER YOUR DEBT.

27:32.190 --> 27:33.980
REALLY? DID HE...

27:34.020 --> 27:36.690
-SAY HE'D COVER
THE VIG, TOO OR...
-JAKE.

27:36.730 --> 27:39.200
OH, NO, I'M JUST...
I'M... JOKING.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.950
&lt;EXHALES&gt; ANYWAYS,
I'LL STAY ON SULLIVAN,
ALL RIGHT?

27:41.990 --> 27:43.660
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.
YOU LOOK TIRED.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.790
YOU'RE AN OLD MAN, NOW.
YOU NEED SOME NAPS.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.410
NOW YOU'VE MENTION IT, UH...

27:47.450 --> 27:49.080
I HAVE A HOT WIFE TO GO TO.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.210
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

27:50.750 --> 27:51.880
YEAH, BYE.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.250
I MEAN, ROSE IS PRETTY.

27:53.290 --> 27:54.840
I DON'T MEAN TO DISRESPECT.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.800
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
DEBT THING, JUST...

27:58.420 --> 27:59.760
TRUST ME, OKAY?

27:59.800 --> 28:01.840
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
IT'S MY PROBLEM, NOT YOURS.

28:01.890 --> 28:02.930
NO.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.260
WE'LL FIGURE
THIS OUT TOGETHER.

28:06.350 --> 28:07.850
ALL RIGHT.

28:07.890 --> 28:09.060
&lt;DEEP SIGH&gt;

28:19.530 --> 28:20.860
[ROSE] THEY'RE BIG BOYS, MALACHY.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.280
THEY'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

28:23.110 --> 28:24.200
[MAL] YEAH.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.950
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
TAKING MONEY FROM MARTIN.

28:27.990 --> 28:30.000
I'D RATHER TAKE ON
BIG FAT RONNIE, ANY DAY.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.790
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

28:31.830 --> 28:33.210
WE COULD MORTGAGE THE HOUSE.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.420
IF IT COMES TO IT, ABSOLUTELY.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.630
IT'S MY FAULT.
I GOT JAKE INTO THIS
WITH HIS BROTHER.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.180
I'M THE ONE WHO NEEDS
HIS HEAD EXAMINED.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.930
YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP
CHRISTIAN FEEL SAFE.

28:43.970 --> 28:46.600
-GET HIM SET UP AND...
-BUT I SHOULDN'T DRAG
JAKE INTO THAT!

28:46.640 --> 28:47.760
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.930
JAKE'S ALWAYS BEEN
BAILIN' HIS BROTHER OUT,

28:50.980 --> 28:52.940
-TAKIN' THE BLAME.
-YOU'RE A GOOD DAD.

28:53.730 --> 28:54.810
YOU LOVE 'EM BOTH.

28:54.850 --> 28:56.610
-WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.
-YEAH.

28:56.650 --> 28:57.650
[ROSE] YEAH.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.740
&lt;ENGINE SPUTTERING&gt;

29:06.820 --> 29:08.700
LISTEN TO ME.

29:08.740 --> 29:12.000
I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY
FROM ROSE AND I WANT YOU TO
STAY AWAY FROM MY FATHER.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.870
-DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
-WHY YOU GOTTA BE LIKE THAT?

29:13.920 --> 29:16.630
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
I'M JUST HERE, TRYIN' TO HELP.

29:16.670 --> 29:18.040
LOOK, I CAN GET YOU OUT
FROM UNDER.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.710
YOU AND THAT
HALF-WIT BROTHER OF YOURS.
ARE YOU INTERESTED?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.340
HE'S THE HALF-WIT?

29:22.380 --> 29:24.300
YEAH, RIGHT.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.050
THERE YOU GO.
I SAID I'D DO IT.

29:26.550 --> 29:27.640
HERE.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.890
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.770
LOUD AND CLEAR.

29:31.810 --> 29:33.270
I HEAR YA.

29:33.310 --> 29:35.350
BUT YOU WANT TO RETHINK
THIS LITTLE OFFER.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.320
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD OFFER.
ALL YOUR TROUBLES GO AWAY AND
THERE' NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.440
SO, WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO HELPFUL ALL OF A SUDDEN?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.990
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

29:44.030 --> 29:47.820
AND I CAUSED SOME
GRIEF TO YOU AND YOURS.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.410
AND NO MATTER WHERE
IN THE WORLD ROSIE GOES,
I'M ALWAYS GONNA LOVE HER.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.950
AND I MEAN THAT IN A NICE WAY.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.910
AND SHE LOVE YOU AND
SHE LOVES MALACHY AND
ALL YOU LITTLE DOYLES.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.080
SO... ALL I WANNA DO IS HELP.

29:58.040 --> 29:58.840
TAKE THE MONEY.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.050
TAKE IT.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.880
TO BE HONEST,
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE YOU.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.880
BUT?

30:04.920 --> 30:08.550
BUT I HAVE MY OWN
PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW AND
I DON'T NEED ANY OF YOURS.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.680
ALL RIGHT.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.510
I GOT THE SOLUTIONS.

30:12.470 --> 30:13.930
TELL YA WHAT?
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.410
&lt;FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING&gt;

30:33.080 --> 30:35.960
-WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?
-I WAS, UH,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.670
JUST LOOKING FOR MY WALLET.

30:38.710 --> 30:39.750
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

30:40.210 --> 30:42.050
I FORGOT MY BOOK.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.210
OH. OH, THIS BOOK?

30:45.550 --> 30:46.720
-OH...
-YEAH.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.050
DIDN'T, UH, CALVIN SULLIVAN
WRITE THAT BOOK?

30:49.090 --> 30:51.010
-I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE.
-OH, NO. YOU DON'T UH...

30:51.050 --> 30:52.890
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

30:52.930 --> 30:56.100
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'M WORKING FOR
CALVIN SULLIVAN, ALL RIGHT?

30:56.140 --> 30:57.940
-YOU KNOW CALVIN?
-YEAH. HE HIRED ME.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.150
HE HIRED YOU?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:00.190 --> 31:02.820
MY NAME IS JAKE DOYLE,
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.940
&lt;JENNIFER MOANING&gt;

31:04.980 --> 31:05.990
SORRY...

31:06.030 --> 31:07.740
&lt;JENNIFER MOANING&gt;

31:07.780 --> 31:09.530
OH, NO, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T!
OH, MY GOD!

31:09.570 --> 31:10.780
WHAT THE HELL!

31:11.620 --> 31:13.280
&lt;JENNIFER MOANS&gt;

31:13.330 --> 31:15.200
WELL... WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

31:16.330 --> 31:17.500
AHEM!

31:20.040 --> 31:22.920
WE'VE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER
SINCE HE LEFT THE FORCE.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.340
[JAKE] OKAY.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.460
I LOVE HIM. I REALLY DO.

31:26.510 --> 31:29.680
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
DOCTOR, BUT WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL YOUR HUSBAND?

31:29.720 --> 31:31.300
YEAH! I KNOW, I WILL.

31:31.340 --> 31:33.140
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
THE PERFECT MARRIAGE.

31:33.180 --> 31:36.640
CALVIN WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH DR. ELLEN FOR
THREE MONTHS LAST YEAR.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.850
REALLY?

31:37.890 --> 31:39.690
OH, I'M SUCH A SCREW-UP.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.150
GOOD NEWS IS WE ALL ARE.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.190
IT'S PART OF
THE HUMAN CONDITION.

31:42.230 --> 31:45.020
I ONLY SAW JOE TWICE
WHEN HE WAS WITH THE POLICE.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.690
AND YOU KNOW,
HE NEVER TOOK
ANY DRUGS OR ANYTHING,

31:46.730 --> 31:48.780
HE WAS JUST SO STRESSED
AT THAT JOB.

31:48.820 --> 31:51.820
SO, IF IT'S NOT JOSEPH
THAT'S AFTER YOU,

31:51.860 --> 31:53.910
-WHO DO YOU THINK IS?
-HONESTLY...

31:53.950 --> 31:56.330
-NO IDEA.
-WHAT ABOUT DR. ELLEN?

31:56.370 --> 31:59.620
DOES SHE KNOW
THAT YOU KNEW THAT SHE
AND YOUR HUSBAND WERE...

31:59.660 --> 32:01.000
OH, NO, NO, NO. NO.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.670
I JUST THINK SHE'S
A TERRIBLE PSYCHIATRIST.
THAT SHE KNOWS.

32:03.710 --> 32:04.960
LISTEN, UM...

32:06.250 --> 32:08.010
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HELPING ME.

32:08.050 --> 32:09.340
PLEASE TAKE THIS.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.840
IT'LL COVER YOUR COSTS.
AND THEN WE'RE EVEN.

32:13.180 --> 32:14.260
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

32:14.300 --> 32:16.060
THIS IS VERY GENEROUS.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.060
BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ACCEPT.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.730
I'M STILL WORKING
FOR YOUR HUSBAND
TECHNICALLY AND...

32:21.640 --> 32:22.730
WELL...

32:24.310 --> 32:26.190
YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

32:26.230 --> 32:27.940
CALL YOUR HUSBAND.
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.150
GET A DIVORCE.
HE'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.990
CATCH YOU LATER.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.420
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO?
WE SHOULD...

32:44.460 --> 32:45.960
GO AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.010
I'VE GOT THE PLACE
UP IN TRINITY BAY,
VIEW OF THE OCEAN.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.760
THAT'S A NICE IDEA.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.390
WANNA GO TO ST-PIERRE?

33:02.100 --> 33:04.060
OR, UH, OR PORT-AU-PORT?

33:04.100 --> 33:05.230
I MEAN, ANYWHERE.
IT'S YOUR CALL.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.150
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT.

33:09.190 --> 33:10.690
I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK
THIS WEEKEND.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.030
WE ALL NEED TIME
TO RELAX, DON'T WE?

33:13.070 --> 33:17.240
LITTLE R&amp;R, SPEND THE WEEKEND
MAYBE IN THE FOG AND THE RAIN?

33:17.280 --> 33:19.080
IF THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT TO DO, WE CAN

33:20.080 --> 33:21.870
DRINK WINE AND...

33:21.910 --> 33:23.080
-STAY IN BED ALL...
-&lt;GASPS&gt;

33:23.120 --> 33:24.710
I'M SORRY. SORRY.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.080
-IT'S OKAY.
-NO, I'M...

33:26.880 --> 33:27.880
MAN!

33:29.300 --> 33:31.460
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GET CLOSE
TO A WOMAN WHO'D BEEN SHOT.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.880
&lt;BOTH LAUGHING&gt;

33:32.920 --> 33:35.220
-YOU OKAY?
-YEAH. YEAH.

33:35.260 --> 33:38.220
WE'LL DO IT, UM,
LET'S DO IT NEXT WEEK.
WE HAVE TO GO.

33:46.980 --> 33:48.020
HEY.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.690
-COFFEE?
-NO.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.820
LOOKS LIKE JOE IS INNOCENT.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.360
TURNS OUT HE IS WHAT
SULLIVAN WAS TRYING
TO HIDE FROM US.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.160
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
STILL TRYING TO KILL HER. WHO?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.530
DR. ELLEN.
PROFESSIONAL JEALOUSY.

33:57.570 --> 34:00.910
MAYBE. I MEAN, CALVIN WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ELLEN.

34:00.950 --> 34:02.330
APPARENTLY. A WHILE BACK.

34:02.370 --> 34:04.830
COULD BE CALVIN HIMSELF
SET THIS WHOLE THING UP.

34:04.870 --> 34:07.080
HE KNOWS ABOUT THE AFFAIR,
HIRED US TO COVER HIS TRACKS,

34:07.120 --> 34:09.460
MAKE HIM LOOK INNOCENT
AS HE TRIED TO BUMP HER OFF.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.130
IT'S A BIT RISKY.

34:11.170 --> 34:12.960
WE ARE EXCELLENT DETECTIVES.

34:13.010 --> 34:15.300
-OH, MY GOD.
-WHAT?

34:15.340 --> 34:18.300
YESTERDAY, I CALLED HARVARD
TO CHECK UP ON
DR. ELLEN GREKOR...

34:18.340 --> 34:19.640
GREKORHELIENOV.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.850
DR. ELLEN GREKORVRESKINKOV.

34:21.890 --> 34:24.520
SHE GRADUATED MAGNA
CUM SOMETHING IN 2001.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.940
-SO?
-I JUST RAN THE NAME
THROUGH POLICE RECORDS.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.650
-SHE WAS ARRESTED IN THE PAST?
-NO!

34:28.690 --> 34:32.020
DR. ELLEN GREKORVRESKINKOV
DIED IN A CAR CRASH.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.480
[MAL] SO...

34:33.530 --> 34:35.240
DR. ELLEN...

34:35.280 --> 34:36.820
IS NOT DR. ELLEN AT ALL.

34:36.860 --> 34:38.160
WE BETTER GET DOWN THERE
RIGHT AWAY.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.040
&lt;NEW AGE MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

34:48.080 --> 34:49.460

UH, ELLEN?

35:02.390 --> 35:03.890
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

35:03.930 --> 35:05.100
[DR. ELLEN] YOU!

35:05.140 --> 35:07.100
YOU ARE A CUTE ONE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

35:07.140 --> 35:08.230
IF I WASN'T A DOCTOR...

35:08.270 --> 35:09.940
-YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR.
-[MAL] SWEETHEART,

35:09.980 --> 35:11.940
WHY DON'T YOU PUT SOME
OF THESE CLOTHES BACK ON?
YOU'RE GONNA GET A CHILL.

35:11.980 --> 35:13.360
HE'S WISE, THIS ONE.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.320
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN REBORN
MANY TIMES.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.990
WE KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

35:17.030 --> 35:19.530
WHO I... WHO AM I?

35:19.570 --> 35:21.570
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.
WHO ARE YOU?

35:23.700 --> 35:25.040
I WON'T GO TO JAIL!

35:25.080 --> 35:26.750
-OOH...
-I WON'T! I WON'T!

35:26.790 --> 35:27.870
-[JAKE] HEY.
-[MAL] HEY, ELLEN.

35:27.910 --> 35:29.330
HI, ELLEN! LOOK AT ME. HI!

35:29.370 --> 35:30.960
-HI.
-HI.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.130
AAH!

35:33.960 --> 35:35.500
I KNEW YOU LIKED ME.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.380
YEAH, I DO LIKE YA.

35:38.630 --> 35:40.090
SO, LET'S GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

35:40.130 --> 35:42.050
START BY TELLIN' ME
YOUR REAL NAME.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.350
[DR. ELLEN] SO, I FLUNKED OUT
OF MED SCHOOL, SO WHAT?

35:45.390 --> 35:47.430
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE NOT A REAL DOCTOR.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.440
DID YOU KILL
THE REAL ELLEN, OR...

35:51.480 --> 35:53.610
GOD! NO!

35:53.650 --> 35:55.860
NO, I JUST...
I JUST ASSUMED HER IDENTITY.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.990
SHE HAD NO FAMILY,
SHE LIVED IN ANOTHER COUNTY.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.490
IT'S NOT AS HARD
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.450
THAT'S ONE WAY
TO GET AN IVY LEAGUE DEGREE.

36:02.490 --> 36:05.200
I KNOW I CAN HELP
PEOPLE. WHY SHOULD I LET
A LITTLE FAILURE STOP ME?

36:05.240 --> 36:07.500
-DID SOMEBODY DRUG ME?
-[MAL] DRINK THIS.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.330
VITAMIN C SMOOTHS
OUT THE ROUGH SPOTS.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.210
WELL, I'D ASK YOU
TO SIGN THIS, BUT...
WHAT'S THE POINT?

36:19.010 --> 36:22.130
SO, SHE ADMITS
SHE'S NOT THE REAL DR. ELLEN.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.260
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?
&lt;EXHALES DEEPLY&gt;

36:23.300 --> 36:24.680
BRING HER TO THE HOSPITAL,
I GUESS?

36:24.720 --> 36:28.350
TURN HER IN TO WHOEVER YOU
TURN IN FAKE DOCTORS TO?

36:28.390 --> 36:30.850
ELLEN MUST HAVE
BEEN TERRIFIED SULLIVAN
WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

36:30.890 --> 36:32.520
THAT'S REASON ENOUGH
TO TRY AND KILL HER.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.360
YEAH, BUT WHY
WOULD SHE DRUG HERSELF?

36:34.400 --> 36:36.070
NO, NO, LOOK,
THE ANSWER, IT'S HERE.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.110
IT'S... IT'S RIGHT
UNDER OUR NOSES.
WE JUST GOTTA FIND IT.

36:39.150 --> 36:40.440
NG HAS A LOT OF MONEY
ON THE LINE.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.570
HE DOES, BUT IF HE WAS
GONNA DRUG SULLIVAN AND ELLEN,

36:42.610 --> 36:44.450
HE'S NOT GOING TO USE
HIS OWN DRUG TO DO IT.

36:44.490 --> 36:46.160
NO, NO... WHOEVER IT IS,

36:46.200 --> 36:48.290
HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING
AGAINST BOTH OF THEM.

36:49.450 --> 36:52.120
OKAY, WHEN I WALKED
IN ON SULLIVAN AND JOE, RIGHT?

36:52.160 --> 36:54.380
THE RECEPTIONIST, CINDY,
SHE WAS HERE.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.790
WHAT WAS SHE DOING HERE?

36:55.840 --> 36:59.050
SHE SAID SHE WAS UH,
LOOKIN' FOR A BOOK...

37:00.460 --> 37:02.800
CALVIN'S BOOK.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.390
[MAL] MUST BE
A REAL PAGE TURNER.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.350
THINK SHE WAS LYING?

37:06.390 --> 37:08.930
THIS IS CINDY'S PURSE.
WHAT'S HER PURSE DOING HERE?

37:11.350 --> 37:15.310
"TO THE LOVELY CINDY.
MAY YOU FIND THE LOVE AND
HAPPINESS THAT YOU DESERVE,

37:15.350 --> 37:16.360
"CALVIN."

37:18.320 --> 37:20.030

37:28.530 --> 37:30.080
THIS IS HER CELLPHONE.

37:31.620 --> 37:34.420
SHE CALLED CALVIN AN HOUR AGO.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.880
WHEREVER SULLIVAN IS,
SHE'S IN DANGER.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.460
WHAT?

37:41.510 --> 37:42.760
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

37:54.640 --> 37:57.360
&lt;PANTING&gt;

37:57.400 --> 37:59.110
[CINDY] I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

37:59.150 --> 38:01.730
AND SHE WAS CHEATING ON YOU
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.440
CINDY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.400
JUST TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?

38:04.450 --> 38:06.070

38:48.950 --> 38:51.530

38:51.580 --> 38:55.580
ALL CINDY WANTS RIGHT NOW
IS FOR YOU TO TELL HER
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HER.

38:56.910 --> 38:58.750
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CINDY?

39:00.500 --> 39:02.090
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.

39:02.130 --> 39:03.840
CALVIN AND YOU
CAN BE TOGETHER NOW, CINDY,

39:03.880 --> 39:05.760

39:16.350 --> 39:18.390
I MEAN, HOW... HOW COULD WE
BE TOGETHER THEN?
