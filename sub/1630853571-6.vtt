WEBVTT

00:25.568 --> 00:29.196
So, there's the bathroom,
kitchen, the living room,

00:29.280 --> 00:31.282
Justin sleeps in there

00:31.365 --> 00:33.951
and... this,

00:34.034 --> 00:36.996
this is my bedroom.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.375
Cool.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.461
Yeah.
Bedrooms are-- are great.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.879
I have one too.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.719
So, do you want to,
like, do something?

00:51.802 --> 00:53.471
Justin
and your parents should be

00:53.554 --> 00:55.890
at the euchre tournament
for a few more hours, so...

00:55.973 --> 00:57.433
Ah, all away.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.268
We could--
We could watch a movie.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.188
The Wi-Fi got fried
in the storm last night.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.939
Riley's coming
by to fix it later.

01:04.815 --> 01:08.736
Oh, we do have this Croatian
bootleg of <i>Dharma and Greg.</i>

01:10.112 --> 01:11.655
- Season four.
- Oh, great.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.828
Or you could
just kiss me.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.000
Maybe that.

01:29.507 --> 01:32.510
- What up, fam?
- We interrupting?

01:32.593 --> 01:35.346
- Kind of.
- Yeah, well, we're bored.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.476
Who wants to find out why this
is called the murder cabin?

01:42.269 --> 01:45.189
- Ooohh...

01:48.234 --> 01:49.860
Put your fingers
on the board.

01:53.364 --> 01:56.325
We are attempting contact
with the spirit world.

01:56.408 --> 01:59.078
Lost souls trapped
between our world and the next.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.872
So, close your eyes,
clear your mind.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.123
Any tips, Keri?

02:04.375 --> 02:06.752
White eyeliner
makes eye shadow pop.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.671
That's actually
a really good tip.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.886
- Is there a spirit among us?
- Ooooh.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.513
Guys, focus.

02:18.514 --> 02:21.183
Is there
a spirit among us?

02:32.570 --> 02:33.863
Welcome, spirit.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.991
We come
seeking answers.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.536
When will Billie
and Killian go to Bone Town?

02:40.619 --> 02:42.913
- So dumb.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.040
Ah, keep your finger
on the board

02:45.124 --> 02:46.417
or you'll invite
an evil spirit in.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.507
Do you have a name,
wandering spirit?

03:18.157 --> 03:21.201
Y-S-I-A-M.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.913
Yes, I am?

03:26.749 --> 03:28.042
What do you want,
Ysiam?

03:30.920 --> 03:36.216
B-L-U-D.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.473
Do you mean blood?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.981
There’s six of us.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.279
Weed break.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.494
Which one of you bitches
finished my stash?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.037
In our defense--

04:06.080 --> 04:08.415
- Yeah, we did.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.210
I'm going to Ulrika’s
to borrow a cup of bud

04:11.293 --> 04:13.253
while she’s
at the tournament.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.464
- Won’t she notice?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.424
Who do you think
taught me how to roll?

04:19.051 --> 04:20.302
BRB.

04:25.391 --> 04:27.559
Okay,
which one of you moved it?

04:27.643 --> 04:30.604
- Don't look at me.
- Keri can barely spell.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.149
I'm better
with shapes.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.778
"If You Could Read My Mind"]

04:43.325 --> 04:44.743
What's taking
her so long?

04:44.827 --> 04:46.996
Ready to stick
pins in my eyes.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.206
We could watch
<i>Dharma and Janko</i>

04:49.289 --> 04:50.499
‘til she gets back.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.043
- Janko’s hilarious.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.629
What was that?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.428
Holy shit.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.096
What the hell
is that?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.141
Are those
Olive’s jeans?

05:09.893 --> 05:12.646
“One down.
Five to go.”

05:32.166 --> 05:34.043
I bet Olive’s
just messing with us

05:34.126 --> 05:36.045
- for stealing her weed.
- Or stealing her homework.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.796
Or toasting her lizard.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.632
He looked cold.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.889
- Wait, what?
- What the hell is that?

05:46.972 --> 05:50.142
- Is that a fucking crossbow?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.147
- Oh, nice shot!

05:56.273 --> 05:58.233
Oh, my God.
Go, go, go, go, go.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.405
Go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.115
Killian, lock the other door.
Call 911.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.911
No signal.
Wi-Fi’s still down.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.998
Aah!
How does this thing work?

06:13.082 --> 06:14.666
They're going back
into the woods.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.878
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Do you think Olive’s dead?

06:17.961 --> 06:20.005
No, Olive’s a stoner.

06:20.089 --> 06:21.882
They always survive
until the last act.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.717
- You need them for comedy.
- This isn't a movie, nerd.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.928
Guys, we have to make a run
for the dock right now.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.597
Do you want to be the dumb jock
that eats it in the first act?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.058
- You can’t outrun an arrow.
- If he’s the jock who are we?

06:31.141 --> 06:33.644
I’m the final girl,
so you guys are the dumb slu--

06:33.727 --> 06:35.562
Fun girls.
You guys are the fun girls.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.481
- What are we going to do?

06:39.233 --> 06:41.902
Well, the killer always tries
to separate us, right?

06:41.985 --> 06:45.280
Makes us easier to pick off,
so we stick together

06:45.364 --> 06:48.367
until the signal comes back
or until our parents come home.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.660
Okay.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.036
Yeah.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.423
Shouldn't you fill that
with boiling water?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.926
Why?
Do you want soup?

07:06.009 --> 07:08.178
- Can anyone hear that?

07:09.304 --> 07:10.722
Guys?

07:11.682 --> 07:13.350
- Keri!

07:13.433 --> 07:15.102
No, no, no, no.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.645
No, no,
let me go, okay?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.230
I was bullied
by my imaginary friend.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.566
- Ghosts hate me.
- No, no, no.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.526
It’s just
the wind or something.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.237
- Holy shit!

07:25.320 --> 07:27.364
- Keri!

07:27.447 --> 07:30.075
Keri! Keri! No!
I will not be an only child.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.535
They’re weird
and self-obsessed.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.453
- I'm an only child.
- Yeah, see?

07:38.834 --> 07:40.377
Everything
will be just fine

07:40.460 --> 07:42.004
if we just
stick to--

07:43.505 --> 07:44.715
- Together.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.021
Open up!
Is anyone there?

07:59.104 --> 08:00.439
Oh, Riley, thank God!

08:00.522 --> 08:03.150
- Oh, God.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.736
What the hell
is going on?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.696
Some crazy crossbow freak
chased me off the deck.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.281
I barely
made it inside.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.908
We know, we've been
trying to call for help,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.367
but the signal's
still down.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.453
- Can you fix it?
- I brought your cable.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.413
but there is no way
I'm going out there

08:16.496 --> 08:18.916
with a crossbow
bathrobe psycho.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.004
Fuck.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.715
Did you use that?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.008
In here?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.845
Does the name Ysiam
mean anything to you?

08:33.805 --> 08:35.390
Shit, shit.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.895
Local legend says
that this rock was once

08:39.978 --> 08:41.563
a witch coven’s
party pad.

08:41.647 --> 08:44.691
Some locals
drowned the coven

08:44.775 --> 08:46.443
and the head witch
cursed this place,

08:46.526 --> 08:50.113
asking for blood
if anyone disturbed their rest.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.117
I thought
it was bullshit, but...

08:55.827 --> 08:57.955
the head witch’s name
was Ysiam.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.333
- Fuck.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.711
Story has it the only way
to send her followers back...

09:06.588 --> 09:08.382
is with the blood
of six virgins.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.844
- Keri’s a virgin?
- Such a liar.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.140
- Where's Keri?
- Too soon.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.522
We can't just stay here
and let them pick us off.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.816
Okay.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.695
All right.
We make a run for my boat.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.446
We'll get to the Boathouse,
we’ll call for help.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.198
If you don't die,
come back for us, ‘kay?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.033
And bring us some snacks.
Yours suck.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.539
How many
of those freaks did you see

09:40.622 --> 09:41.957
when you were
on the roof?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.377
I wasn't on the roof.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.435
Ah!
Well, fuck me in half.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.811
- Why? What's wrong?
- My boat’s gone.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.896
- Okay. Okay.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.232
We need to go back
to the cabin like now, alright?

10:07.316 --> 10:09.318
- Ah, fuck!

10:09.401 --> 10:11.111
Oh, my God! Fuck!

10:11.194 --> 10:13.363
Holy shit, Riley!

10:13.447 --> 10:16.158
- Killian! Oh, fuck.
- Go! Go!

10:16.241 --> 10:18.076
- I’m right behind you.
- Okay.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.537
Get inside.
Get inside. Get inside.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.001
- He’s gone.
- Who’s gone?

10:26.084 --> 10:28.003
- Riley!
- Did he fix the internet?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.505
- What?
- Billie! I’m coming!

10:30.589 --> 10:32.382
- Justin?
- No, no, no, no, no.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.259
Move.
I have to go after him.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.261
No, in <i>New Moon</i> when
Bella hears Edward's voice,

10:36.345 --> 10:38.638
it's just-- it's just
her mind playing tricks on her.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.932
- Is this <i>Twilight</i> again?
- It's a horror movie too.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.976
Well, falling in love’s scary.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.396
Man, the shit we take
from you horror purists online.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.025
- Online. Riley’s cable.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.610
We can replace it
and call for help

10:51.693 --> 10:53.528
- without a phone signal.
- Where's the modem?

10:53.612 --> 10:55.238
In the crawlspace
under the cabin.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.157
Of course it is.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.825
I'll just
run down there and swap it.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.203
And then when I get back,
we can bring up FaceTime

11:01.286 --> 11:03.038
and bunker down
until someone comes to help us.

11:04.623 --> 11:08.293
- There's more of them now.
- Okay. Distract them.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.253
Not that kind of fun girl.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.175
- Yeah. Go.
- Be careful.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.053
Be fast.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.272
Come get me
you Volturi sons of bitches.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.903
Thank God he's hot.

11:34.986 --> 11:36.613
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:37.489 --> 11:41.159
Come on!
Let's go! I’m right here!

11:41.243 --> 11:43.412
- Bring it on, motherfucker!

11:43.495 --> 11:45.831
Okay. Okay, Billie.
We’re gonna do this.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.999
You’re not gonna die
in this shitty fucking cabin.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.961
God.
Oh, my God!

11:51.044 --> 11:53.422
Oh, God. Okay.
Oh, shit. Shit.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.674
Okay. Killian!

11:56.800 --> 11:58.844
- Killian?
- Open the door!

11:58.927 --> 12:01.096
- Killian!
- Come on, come on!

12:01.972 --> 12:04.141
- Open the door, Teri!

12:04.224 --> 12:05.434
Did you reboot the modem?

12:05.517 --> 12:07.018
No,
there's too many of them.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.770
Maybe they'll leave
once they have you.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.564
You’re the final girl.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.774
Aah! Come on!
Come on, I have an idea.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.322
We can jump.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.658
Are you nuts?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.493
Jumping is always scarier
than the water, remember?

12:23.577 --> 12:25.704
At <i>Raven’s Rock,</i>
not the <i>Cabin in the Woods.</i>

12:25.787 --> 12:27.289
Okay, on three.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.832
Okay.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.083
One.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.418
Two.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.141
<i>Cabin in the Woods.</i>

12:46.224 --> 12:48.310
Do you have a name,
wandering spirit?

12:48.393 --> 12:49.478
Are those
Olive’s jeans?

12:49.561 --> 12:50.687
<i>- Y.</i>
- BRB.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.314
<i>- S.</i>
- Open up!

12:52.397 --> 12:54.357
Do you want to be
the dumb jock that

12:54.441 --> 12:55.775
- eats it in the first half?
<i>- I.</i>

12:55.859 --> 12:57.277
This isn't a movie.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.987
- I thought it was bullshit--
<i>- A.</i>

12:59.070 --> 13:00.489
The head witch’s
name was Ysiam.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.324
<i>- M.</i>
- You’re the final girl!

13:02.407 --> 13:03.742
<i>Cabin in the Woods.</i>

13:04.367 --> 13:05.577
Cabin in the fucking woods!

13:05.660 --> 13:07.162
No, Billie, wait!

13:15.086 --> 13:17.380
<i>Hey, Opal Bader Ginsberg.</i>

13:17.464 --> 13:18.965
<i>- You there?</i>
- Go ahead, Olive.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.884
<i>I’m clear</i>
<i>of the cabin.</i>

13:20.967 --> 13:23.053
<i>Ouija board’s in place,</i>
<i>phone jammer’s on.</i>

13:23.136 --> 13:25.847
<i>I'm heading to Ulrika’s</i>
<i>until Prank Day is over.</i>

13:25.931 --> 13:27.432
Do they suspect
the gag of it all?

13:27.516 --> 13:28.892
<i>Not a clue.</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:30.602
<i>My generation</i>
<i>is screwed.</i>

13:30.685 --> 13:32.229
That's a go,
everyone.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.897
Walkies stay on
for further instructions.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.607
Jane, prep the arrow.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.317
<i>Don't skimp</i>
<i>on the blood.</i>

13:37.400 --> 13:39.027
Copy that Opie-dopes.
Question.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.071
Am I just sticking
the arrow into the door

13:41.154 --> 13:42.489
<i>or am I actually</i>
<i>firing the crossbow?</i>

13:42.572 --> 13:44.074
What?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.784
<i>Shooting would be</i>
<i>more immersive.</i>

13:45.867 --> 13:47.702
That's what I said.
Told you, Jayner.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.496
- This is a bad idea.
- Mm, it’s a beauty.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.706
No. Wayne, stop.
All right?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.500
Nobody is shooting
anyone with anything.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.545
Opal, when did blood
and crossbows come into this?

13:56.628 --> 13:58.588
Guys, I want Billie
to remember Prank Day

13:58.672 --> 14:00.715
with a smile, okay,
not regression therapy.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.342
She’s not gonna
come back next year

14:02.425 --> 14:03.635
if she's still having
nightmares about it.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.761
This isn't your high school's

14:04.844 --> 14:06.054
dinner theatre, Justin.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.014
It's my opus.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.308
Did you hear that?

14:10.392 --> 14:12.686
Justin wants to come
back next summer with Billie.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.145
That would be
a real win for him.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.855
And a real loss
for us.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.357
Since Justin
has been here,

14:17.440 --> 14:19.609
we have lost an election,
a bathroom,

14:19.693 --> 14:21.903
and our son might lose
his virginity to his cousin.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.405
- Step-cousin.
- Ugh.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.864
Still gross.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.616
We cannot lose
anything else to Justin.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.451
We have to make sure
they never come back.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.078
How?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.871
By scaring
Billie so much

14:31.955 --> 14:33.707
that she calls her parents
to come get her.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.042
There's no way they'll
let her come back after that.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.377
Sounds a little harsh.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.628
It was Justin's idea

14:38.712 --> 14:39.796
to bring back
Prank Day.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.047
He made
his own bed.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.720
- Oh, nice shot!

14:46.803 --> 14:48.930
- That's my boy!
- Victor!

14:49.806 --> 14:51.099
- That’s our boy.
- Oh, my God!

14:51.182 --> 14:52.309
- Get inside! Go, go!

14:52.392 --> 14:54.019
Wayne! Come on!

14:54.102 --> 14:57.355
Okay. Okay. Hold on.
What happened back there?

14:57.439 --> 15:00.442
- You got hit with a rock.
- Was I there for that?

15:00.525 --> 15:02.444
You were supposed
to wait like we practiced.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.571
- You never listen.
- Okay, okay, okay.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.948
Next time you get hit
in the head with a rock.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.658
- Thank you.
- Great. Come on, come on.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.535
- We gotta go.
- No, this way.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.245
Right. Okay.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.372
- What happened back there?
- Oh, my--

15:14.456 --> 15:15.999
<i>They barricaded</i>
<i>themselves inside the cabin</i>

15:16.082 --> 15:17.917
<i>right on schedule.</i>

15:18.001 --> 15:19.502
<i>Dad, you in position</i>
<i>for Operation Ouija Magnet?</i>

15:19.586 --> 15:21.046
In the hammer lane,
little buddy.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.714
<i>Spy talk,</i>
<i>not trucker talk.</i>

15:22.797 --> 15:24.633
That’s like
asking a fish not to swim.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.301
<i>Magnets in the</i>
<i>planchette are pretty snappy</i>

15:26.384 --> 15:27.969
<i>so don’t work</i>
<i>too hard.</i>

15:28.053 --> 15:29.929
- 10-4.
- <i>Second warning.</i>

15:30.013 --> 15:31.640
Whatever.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.558
Maisy,
what the fuck?

15:33.642 --> 15:35.810
This is supposed to be
<i>Scooby-Doo</i> scary.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.312
Shh, shh, shh.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.356
It’ll all be over soon,
sweetie.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.899
Hey, hey, <i>Assassin's Creed,</i>
she can't breathe.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.984
- Sorry.
- Can't be too careful.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.944
There are witches
in these woods.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.571
All right, this shit’s
getting out of hand.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.114
Maisy, this is exactly
why Prank Day

15:48.198 --> 15:49.532
was cancelled
in the first place.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.742
No, you're the reason

15:50.825 --> 15:52.243
that Prank Day got cancelled.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.371
Who can't handle
a fake alien abduction?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.456
You told them
to eat me first

15:56.539 --> 15:58.083
because
I had more meat.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.793
- And I stand by that decision.
- Oh, my God.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.753
You wanted
to bring Prank Day back

16:01.836 --> 16:03.171
because Billie
is this huge horror fan,

16:03.254 --> 16:04.673
but if it
doesn't feel real,

16:04.756 --> 16:06.841
she's going to be
the first to clock it.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.678
So just sit back
and let Ysiam work her magic.

16:09.761 --> 16:10.929
Should have been
my name backwards.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.430
It was my idea.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.349
Nitsuj sounds
like a lice shampoo.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.686
Come on, honey,
Opal’s got snacks in the car.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.355
You can bring
your kettle.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.778
Wayne Eunice
Beverly Moore,

16:26.861 --> 16:28.405
you get your ass down!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.949
I was supposed to do
the roof walk.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.784
The roof
can’t handle your weight!

16:32.867 --> 16:35.745
- You can't go rogue like that.
- Hey, I’m Wayne.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.664
Don't remind me.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.166
That's a cool dress.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.461
<i>Falcons</i>
<i>have fled the nest.</i>

16:43.545 --> 16:45.088
<i>Riley and the kids</i>
<i>are leaving the cabin.</i>

16:45.171 --> 16:47.090
We got to hustle
if we want to beat the kids

16:47.173 --> 16:48.758
to the Boathouse
for the hood reveal.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.844
We're not doing
the Boathouse thing anymore.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.345
Yeah, there have been
some last-minute rewrites.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.222
What do you mean?
What kind of rewrites?

16:54.305 --> 16:55.765
Opal and I thought
that ending the prank

16:55.849 --> 16:57.434
with the hood reveal
was a bit tame.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.227
Relax, we're just
shooting and abducting Riley,

16:59.310 --> 17:00.895
and then we're surrounding
the kids so they think

17:00.979 --> 17:02.814
- that Ysiam is coming.
- And then what?

17:02.897 --> 17:04.774
Are you going to sacrifice
them into the fire pit?

17:04.858 --> 17:07.068
- Do you think it's deep enough?
- All right, that's it.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.862
I'm calling it,
Joan Carpenter.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.156
This just went
from <i>Goosebumps</i> to <i>Saw 5.</i>

17:13.867 --> 17:15.744
Billie?
I’m coming!

17:15.827 --> 17:17.579
- Hi-yah!

17:17.662 --> 17:19.289
God,
what the hell, Maisy?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.749
Don’t even think
about moving.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.667
MI-5 once tried
to recruit me.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.670
- Oh, as if!
- I know! Me, a public servant?

17:25.754 --> 17:27.589
- What a waste.
- Maisy, please come on.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.132
I'm begging you here.
Please let me go.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.842
You got to stop this.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.469
You don't think
we had better things to do

17:32.552 --> 17:34.179
than play make-believe

17:34.262 --> 17:35.847
while you paper over
your failures with Billie?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.640
Of course we did,
but we're here because of you.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.267
- I just wanted it to be fun.
- Mission accomplished.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.186
- I'm having a blast.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.562
I'm going to need
some bungee cords.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.813
The Dalai Drama’s
gone rogue.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.356
Well,
the joke's on you

17:45.440 --> 17:46.900
because I'm putting that
on a T-shirt.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.610
Oh, God,

17:48.693 --> 17:50.904
why do you taste
like lavender?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.280
Riley, please.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.948
I know
we're in this

17:54.032 --> 17:56.201
not-talking-cause-Justin's-hot
garbage phase,

17:56.284 --> 17:57.786
but would you
please untie me?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.038
Riley, come on.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.623
Billie's probably
really scared.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.043
- That's what you wanted.
- That is not what I wanted.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.795
I was trying to do
something special

18:06.878 --> 18:08.755
so that
she’d come back next year.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.632
In my prank,
you got to be the hero.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.509
You got to save
the kids.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.552
In Maisy’s, you get nailed
in the leg with an arrow.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.054
Why are you
helping her?

18:17.222 --> 18:19.015
You pimped me out...

18:20.391 --> 18:21.518
to Gil the Thrill.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.396
I know.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.399
I know I did that.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.031
Riley...

18:37.242 --> 18:39.494
having Billie again,
Maisy getting the cottage,

18:39.577 --> 18:42.747
this chance that I got to get
back everything that I lost?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.751
I just went crazy,
I went...

18:48.044 --> 18:50.088
really crazy and you got
caught in the middle.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.136
I'm sorry.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.725
I’m really sorry.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.605
Please don't help
Maisy win.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.950
I never did this...

19:19.993 --> 19:21.160
for Maisy.

19:23.079 --> 19:28.501
"Plastic Ferrari"]

19:51.733 --> 19:54.819
Bondage, threesomes...

19:54.903 --> 19:56.529
I think
you're going to need

19:56.613 --> 19:58.698
to update your profile,
there, Tindersnake.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.952
Cabin in the fucking woods!

20:03.036 --> 20:05.121
- Billie, wait!
- Oh, Billie.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.874
Busted, busted, busted,
busted, all of you!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.709
Ysiam is Maisy
spelled backwards.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.088
- Mom? Dad?

20:14.172 --> 20:17.050
<i>We’ve been made.</i>
<i>Stand down.</i>

20:19.010 --> 20:21.137
- Surprise.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.139
Whoa. What the fuck?

20:29.145 --> 20:31.314
- Are you serious?
- What the fuck, Boomers?

20:31.397 --> 20:33.274
- Hey, girls.
- It’s not a prank!

20:33.358 --> 20:35.526
It’s torture!
Oh, good, you’re all caught up.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.613
"White Sky"]

20:49.248 --> 20:51.459
That was pretty low
using your evil genius

20:51.542 --> 20:53.002
against your older brother.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.754
I think
you mean 'thank you.'

20:54.837 --> 20:56.756
For scaring
the shit out of me?

20:56.839 --> 20:59.884
For dragging your mopey ass
romance into the second act.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.679
I was waiting
for the perfect moment.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.306
Did you or did you not get
your first kiss with Billie?

21:06.516 --> 21:07.558
Yes.

21:08.643 --> 21:09.686
You're welcome.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.482
Wow.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.234
And that,
twisted sisters,

21:16.317 --> 21:18.236
is why you should
never steal my weed.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.404
- Sorry.
- Okay.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.030
Won't happen again.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.865
We need to tell mom
that Justin and Maisy

21:22.949 --> 21:24.367
are the witches’ bitches.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.537
It-- it was fake, Keri.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.705
All of it.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.916
How high up
does this thing go?

21:33.710 --> 21:35.003
You have no idea.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.635
What is wrong with you?

21:42.719 --> 21:43.886
What's wrong
with all of you?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.221
You people are insane.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.432
In what universe
did you think

21:47.515 --> 21:49.058
- this would be okay?
- I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.435
Do you think abuse is funny?

21:50.518 --> 21:53.271
Do you?
I mean, unbelievable.

21:53.354 --> 21:56.232
Absolutely unbelievable.
I almost jumped off the deck.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.317
My parents
are going to freak, Justin.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.028
And I thought Olive was dead.
Keri, too.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.320
I was legitimately
fucking scared.

22:01.404 --> 22:04.073
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Good.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.325
Because remember,
the body count

22:06.409 --> 22:07.827
is always higher
in the sequel.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.497
The sequel?

22:11.581 --> 22:14.125
Oh, yeah,
you’re a dead man next year.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.836
You are a good little actress.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.672
- I felt terrible.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.180
Maureen, hi,
do you have a second?

22:28.222 --> 22:31.142
Has it been 20 years since
I called you by your real name?

22:31.225 --> 22:33.144
No, I want to float
something by you.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.645
I am sorry.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.814
I'm sorry
that I left you with Maisy

22:36.898 --> 22:39.233
when I was off
getting off.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.944
Riley said you got tied
to a tree for me, so...

22:42.820 --> 22:43.905
say we’re even.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.201
- And I heard you calling me.
- Yeah.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.869
I'd be dead because
you were beyond late.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.454
Right.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.872
You came for me.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.292
Of course I did.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.508
See, it’s not just
about the crossbow

23:03.591 --> 23:04.717
or the roof, Wayne.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.845
It’s you campaigning
for Boathouse president

23:07.929 --> 23:09.639
after I was humiliated.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.642
It’s you obsessing
about Teesa.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.730
It’s not sharing
the Astral Nebula.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.273
I think
I have a concussion.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.776
See,
it's always about you.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.290
- Hey.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.127
Can I come in?

23:39.836 --> 23:41.462
So you can
tie me up again?

23:41.546 --> 23:43.589
So I can apologize.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.591
I might have gotten
a bit too method today.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.844
Psycho, the word
you're looking for is psycho.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.512
Well,
it was good for the role.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.347
But I am sorry
about tying you up.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.058
- That was not cool.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.644
Well,
your sociopathy aside,

23:56.727 --> 23:58.396
Prank Day
was a huge hit.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.190
Billie wants to make it
an annual tradition.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.483
Wonderful.

24:03.568 --> 24:04.861
You guys
better start looking.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.654
Places go fast
around here.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.281
Yeah, well, you know,
we've actually grown kind of

24:08.364 --> 24:09.824
fond of this
little hellhole,

24:09.907 --> 24:11.409
so I'm going to call
Whoreen <i>manana</i>

24:11.492 --> 24:12.743
about renting it
next summer.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.537
Oh, no.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.622
Whoreen’s selling.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.333
What?
What the fuck.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.335
Oh, man.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.087
This place is cursed.

24:23.171 --> 24:25.631
Teesa’s Insta post
got so much attention.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.383
And you and Billie
are the first ones

24:27.466 --> 24:29.385
to rent it
and not disappear or die.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.761
That's huge curb appeal.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.975
And I wonder who gave
Whoreen the idea to sell.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.644
The lake’s changing.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.771
You can't stay stuck
in the past forever.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.858
But it was fun
having you guys here.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.737
Killian and Opal are really
going to miss their cousin.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.785
Great idea for Prank Day,
by the way.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.078
Best one ever.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.836
She wins.
Every time.
