WEBVTT

00:05.573 --> 00:06.817
My course, my win.

00:06.841 --> 00:09.052
Remind me what you Navy boys
are good at again?

00:09.076 --> 00:10.270
Kicking Army's ass.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.815
- Giving up already?
- Hang on a second.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.700
What's this doing here?

00:23.724 --> 00:24.952
I don't know.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.998
Whoa.

00:33.868 --> 00:34.978
Yo, come on, man, let's go.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.470
Not yet.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.299
Weird.

00:43.609 --> 00:45.600
- Navy.
- Huh?

01:39.566 --> 01:40.543
What are you doing?

01:40.567 --> 01:41.544
Nothing.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.480
Those are none of your business.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.148
Those belong to McGee.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.549
- They're funny.
- They're private.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.084
They're self-help CDs.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.487
McLonely Hearts ordered 'em.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.222
Download Your Destiny...

01:52.246 --> 01:53.823
three easy payments
of $19.95 each.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.025
Satisfaction guaranteed

01:55.049 --> 01:56.059
or your money back.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.228
Maybe McGee
is already satisfied.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.763
- Maybe there's an Easter bunny, too.
- Tony...

01:59.787 --> 02:02.032
Anyone can achieve
their fullest potential.

02:02.056 --> 02:04.067
Who we are
might be predetermined,

02:04.091 --> 02:06.336
but the path we follow
is always of our own choosing.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.437
Oh, my God, turn that off.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.437
I love this guy.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.872
Sort of a poor man's Shatner.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.842
We should never allow our fears
or the expectations of others

02:12.866 --> 02:15.078
to set the frontiers
of our destiny.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.746
I've heard enough.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.049
Maybe you're the one
who needs a little self-help.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.251
Well... see, that's where

02:21.275 --> 02:22.519
you're wrong, Ziva.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.887
I'm already enlightened.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.756
I know exactly who I am.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.358
It may not be pretty,

02:28.382 --> 02:31.428
but I am DiNozzo, hear me roar.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.529
Like an elephant?

02:32.553 --> 02:33.930
Grab your gear.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.467
We got a dead civilian doctor
on Naval Academy grounds.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.903
Gunshot.

02:39.927 --> 02:40.937
Get out of his desk.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.072
Getting out of his desk, boss.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.940
- Where's McGee?
- We do not know.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.009
Maybe little Timmy
missed the short bus.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.444
Find him.

02:47.468 --> 02:52.248
I'll find him, and for
being late, he's buying coffee.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.718
Here you go, sir.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.252
Uh, you sure this is mine?
This seems

02:56.276 --> 02:57.587
- like a lot for my order.
- Yeah.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.988
It was just phoned in.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.139
Thanks.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.495
Can I help you with that?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.030
Me?

03:07.054 --> 03:09.454
Uh, no, no,
I'm-I'm okay, thanks.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.502
Be careful.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.637
Don't want to burn yourself.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.239
I'm a... I'm a trained
professional.

03:16.263 --> 03:17.698
I can tell.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.644
Um, I think I've seen
you here before.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.146
I'm Amanda.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.181
Uh, sorry.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.716
I'm, uh, I'm Tim.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.585
Do you live around here or?

03:28.609 --> 03:29.686
I go to grad school.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.354
I just... I come here
to work sometimes.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.590
Um...

03:33.614 --> 03:35.792
I've got a ring
in my front left pocket.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.926
Could you help me out?

03:36.950 --> 03:38.461
- You... the phone?
- Yes,

03:38.485 --> 03:40.163
uh, phone, sorry.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.165
Oh, um...

03:42.189 --> 03:43.524
Let me just...

03:49.496 --> 03:50.540
Sorry.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.175
Yeah, Tony, what is it?

03:52.199 --> 03:54.644
- We got a call out, Magoo.
- Yeah, I know, I'm coming.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.446
- With the coffees?
- Yes, with the coffees.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.815
- Did you get my pastry?
- Yes, I got your pastry.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.183
Well, what's taking you so long?

04:00.207 --> 04:01.418
- Are you leaving now?
- Uh-huh.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.119
- Get a McMove on. -
- Thanks, you can...

04:03.143 --> 04:04.508
Right.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.158
Um, I have to run.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.393
- I heard.
- Uh...

04:10.417 --> 04:13.163
would you maybe want
to get some coffee together

04:13.187 --> 04:15.178
one morning with me?

04:16.223 --> 04:18.714
Yeah, um, sure.

04:19.726 --> 04:23.973
Okay, um, here... is my number.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.409
Call me.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.844
Speed-dial.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.563
The sooner the better.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.353
Right, see you.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.777
Bye.

04:44.751 --> 04:47.063
License and registration
indicate the victim's

04:47.087 --> 04:49.332
a guy named Dr. Elan Cirreux.

04:49.356 --> 04:50.333
Family?

04:50.357 --> 04:51.568
Divorced, no kids.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.370
Owns a practice here in D.C.
and also in Paris.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.438
I'm here, boss.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.640
So nice of you to make it, Tim.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.810
No excuses, won't happen again.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.212
Danish in the car?

05:02.236 --> 05:03.613
- Scone.
- Chocolate?

05:03.637 --> 05:04.814
Blueberry.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.883
I could tell you were
with somebody, you know.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.551
Think I don't see
that little glint

05:08.575 --> 05:10.520
in your eye,
spring in your step?

05:10.544 --> 05:11.521
Spill, Probilicious.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.722
What's her name? Spill.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.791
I'm gonna get to work now.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.626
Gibbs,

05:16.650 --> 05:18.928
checking prints
with the mobile AFIS.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.097
So far, nothing other
than Cirreux's, and...

05:21.121 --> 05:23.233
the surgical instruments used
were wiped clean.

05:23.257 --> 05:26.102
But I did find some strands
of surgical threads

05:26.126 --> 05:28.071
on the carpet.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.472
Doc worked on somebody.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.708
So why here and not
in a hospital?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.476
Because the patient didn't want

05:33.500 --> 05:35.478
to be seen, that's why.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.679
Director.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.481
I saw the PD report.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.682
Details I've come across before.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.117
I wanted to see for myself.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.286
Copycat?

05:43.310 --> 05:45.710
That would be a relief.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.761
Why would the director come
to a crime scene?

05:51.785 --> 05:52.762
I don't know.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.231
But he's here at this one.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.433
You know, Jethro,

05:57.457 --> 05:59.402
based on the significant
blood loss...

05:59.426 --> 06:01.905
Director.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.807
This is a surprise.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.109
What do you got, Doctor?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.477
Well, I can't confirm it

06:07.501 --> 06:09.345
till I get him back to autopsy,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.314
but it seems to me
that the killer

06:11.338 --> 06:15.251
intentionally shot his victim
in such a way

06:15.275 --> 06:18.421
that he slowly bled out.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.657
You mean, they wanted it
to be painful?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.059
Well, torturous is more like it.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.094
The victim fell
back into the brush,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.964
but later on was turned over

06:27.988 --> 06:30.433
so a second bullet
could be delivered

06:30.457 --> 06:32.168
into the base of the skull.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.703
Severing the brain stem.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.322
Both shots fired
with uncanny precision.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.712
You've seen this before.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.682
It's her signature.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.618
She always delivers a second
shot to finish the job.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.200
Who is she?

06:51.812 --> 06:54.624
Lee Wuan Kai,
a North Korean operative.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.960
She was just in Los Angeles.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.428
I read the report.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.862
Kai was wounded
and then disappeared.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.631
I'm convinced she's here now.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.499
And why Cirreux?

07:03.523 --> 07:05.201
Kai was pretty badly hurt.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.103
She must have gotten
some medical attention,

07:07.127 --> 07:08.371
traveled to D.C.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.306
Probably carjacked the doctor,

07:10.330 --> 07:12.809
forced him to treat her,
and then she killed him.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.144
A lot of theorizing.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.914
You questioning me?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.349
No.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.850
You chase somebody
for almost 20 years,

07:20.874 --> 07:22.185
you start to think like 'em.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.755
In some ways, I know Kai
better than I know myself.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.457
Coincidence, huh?

07:27.481 --> 07:28.691
Maybe.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.693
You think finding this body
in my jurisdiction

07:30.717 --> 07:32.514
is coincidence?

07:42.529 --> 07:44.554
Director?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.210
Find Kai.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.277
We're on it.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.046
She'll use deadly force.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.264
So should you.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.227
Lee Wuan Kai,
North Korean assassin,

08:04.251 --> 08:06.062
one-time fanatical nationalist,

08:06.086 --> 08:07.397
credited with 27 targeted hits

08:07.421 --> 08:10.466
in seven countries,
dozens more by association.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.268
She likes quiet walks
on the beach,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.237
laughing with friends,
and playing Frisbee

08:14.261 --> 08:16.072
with her cocker spaniel Rufus.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.140
It does not say that.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.341
Well, it might as well.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.377
Look at those come-hither eyes,
those perfect

08:21.401 --> 08:23.446
kiss-me-now lips.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.814
No wonder Vance is obsessed.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.883
Kai's killing me,
and I'm just looking at her.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.485
You and Kai are probably
a lot more alike than you think.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.620
I do not follow.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.255
Really? Couple of pretty ladies,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.956
both trained assassins.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.191
You annoy me sometimes.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.293
- Sometimes?
- Most of the time.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.928
Well, something big
must have happened

08:38.952 --> 08:40.530
between Kai and Vance.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.164
Seriously, Director shows up
at a crime scene,

08:42.188 --> 08:43.383
that's not kosher.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.936
Figure of speech.

08:46.960 --> 08:51.174
Oh, ogling the numbers
of the new girl, huh?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.142
Look at you, McDigit.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.679
Mmm, I'm having
a Kreskin-like intuition here.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.681
Is she a redhead?

08:58.705 --> 08:59.949
She is.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.151
Look at you, pulling a page
from the Gibbs playbook.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.186
Nice.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.454
Do not pay attention
to him, McGee.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.590
Whoever she is,
I am sure she is lovely.

09:07.614 --> 09:08.672
Thank you, Ziva.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.094
Why is she nice to you

09:11.118 --> 09:12.428
- and not to me?
- Maybe because

09:12.452 --> 09:14.864
you broke into my desk
and stole my motivational CDs.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.865
I put them back.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.500
You mocked me publicly.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.801
I always do that.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.002
Maybe they're working.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.704
Maybe you should stop drinking

09:21.728 --> 09:23.029
the motivational Kool-Aid.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.643
Ran the victim's name through
the D.C. attorney's office.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.445
There's a lawsuit
pending against...

09:29.469 --> 09:30.446
Elan Cirreux.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.981
Threats made, one B-and-E charge

09:32.005 --> 09:34.784
at his home,
multiple police reports filed.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.686
So he ticked somebody off.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.688
He's a doctor... what they lack

09:38.712 --> 09:40.389
in social skills,
they make up for

09:40.413 --> 09:41.724
in handing out free
pharmaceuticals.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.326
A local nurse by the name of

09:43.350 --> 09:46.929
Linda DeMarco accused him
of sexual assault.

09:46.953 --> 09:50.366
Report quotes her as saying
she wanted to kill him.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.449
Maybe it's not Lee Wuan Kai
after all.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.276
I'm going to add more agents

10:00.300 --> 10:01.410
to the investigation.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.813
Okay.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.015
Your decision.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.418
You didn't give me
much time, though.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.586
I've had almost two decades.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.021
How much more time do you need?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.023
- You want it to be her, I get that.
- No,

10:14.047 --> 10:15.358
I want it to be over.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.959
And based on those
two gunshot wounds...

10:16.983 --> 10:19.695
Two gunshot wounds
doesn't mean she's here.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.017
The hell it doesn't.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.048
Keep talking, Leon.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.208
Just keep talking.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.223
I want it all.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.886
17 years ago,

10:43.910 --> 10:47.256
a UN peacekeeping force
marches into Yugoslavia.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.293
Entire city of Belgrade
went purple.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.295
They pulled from every branch.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.665
So, one night, we're walking
near the opera house.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.734
Somebody takes a shot
at a local politico.

10:58.758 --> 11:01.003
Can't even remember his name.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.674
The shooter was this young girl.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.609
Kai.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.611
So, my partner,
Neil Wilson, and I,

11:08.635 --> 11:10.980
we were the first ones
on the scene.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.083
I landed a shot in her chest.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.585
I killed her.

11:15.609 --> 11:19.889
But she gets up
like nothing ever happened.

11:19.913 --> 11:24.961
Puts one in my shoulder
and she put two in Neil.

11:24.985 --> 11:29.966
And while I'm lying there,
looking at him...

11:29.990 --> 11:33.069
I can feel her piece
up against my neck.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.971
So, now I'm waiting.

11:34.995 --> 11:39.075
You know, I'm-I'm praying.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.078
But it never happened.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.435
Every day I think about his wife
and I think about his baby.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.001
And here I am.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.193
Give me something solid.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.029
Solid doesn't exist.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.498
That's why the Serbs
call her Utvara.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.635
The Phantom.

12:05.659 --> 12:06.802
Yeah, Gibbs.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.804
Boss, I got
DeMarco's home address.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.806
Taking Tony for backup.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.009
Check it out.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.477
Is that a lead?

12:14.501 --> 12:15.845
Not on Kai.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.667
We get anything,
you'll be the first to know.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.887
Is that Amanda?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.222
The coffee vixen?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.891
Maybe.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.092
Text sex, huh?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.094
Will you ask her
what a question mark

12:32.118 --> 12:33.629
wedged between two
dollar signs means?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.531
'Cause it sounded
kind of kinky to me.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.800
She wants to see me tonight,
but I'm probably working.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.201
Oh, don't tell her that.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.071
Tell her you've arranged
a water bed, some squirt guns

12:42.095 --> 12:44.073
and a little bit of candle wax.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.741
Listen to Madonna, too.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.567
Women like Madonna.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.413
Ms. DeMarco?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.748
NCIS. Need to speak with you.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.240
Ooh.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.752
Ms. DeMarco, open up.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.869
We want to talk to you.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.060
Federal agents! Drop it!

13:04.084 --> 13:07.063
Did that piece of filth
Cirreux send you?!

13:07.087 --> 13:09.231
Because I've got
a message for him!

13:09.255 --> 13:10.586
You can tell him...

13:13.126 --> 13:14.704
Did you say Federal agents?

13:14.728 --> 13:16.005
Yes! Federal agents!

13:16.029 --> 13:17.929
Cirreux's dead.
Put the weapon down!

13:19.632 --> 13:20.894
Okay.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.546
Hands in the air!

13:23.570 --> 13:25.348
Okay. Who do you think you are,

13:25.372 --> 13:26.782
Sarah Palin?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.103
Sorry.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.821
Ms. DeMarco's alibi checks out.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.123
She was working a double shift
at Washington General.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.192
Maybe she slipped out
for a few minutes,

13:36.216 --> 13:37.626
just long enough to kill him.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.961
It's not her.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.263
Boss, she shot at us
with a... a very big gun.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.199
It happens.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.734
What happens?

13:44.758 --> 13:46.402
People, they react.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.437
- Irrationally.
- Sometimes.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.072
Call Metro. Fine her.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.407
Take away her toys.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.641
That's it?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.943
Yeah.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.277
She didn't do it.

13:55.301 --> 13:56.579
You heard him, self-helpless.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.880
Call Metro.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.882
- You call.
- Okay.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.250
Then you uncuff her.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.352
Oh, you're afraid
of the nurse, huh?

14:03.376 --> 14:05.011
You are, too.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.591
I'll call Metro.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.259
You uncuff Florence Nightingale.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.275
Because it's your destiny.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.600
Apart from brie-clogged arteries

14:17.624 --> 14:20.336
and a liver that's processed
too much Bordeaux,

14:20.360 --> 14:23.205
our dearly departed physician
was in relatively good health.

14:23.229 --> 14:25.174
Probably would have lived
another two decades

14:25.198 --> 14:27.877
if he hadn't been gunned down
in his golden years.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.780
- Yeah? So what's so puzzling, Duck?
- Something I found

14:30.804 --> 14:32.982
on the body, not in it.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.184
A single human capillus.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.819
- A hair?
- Yes.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.854
The guy's covered in them.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.456
Yeah, but not like this one.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.209
See for yourself.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.294
A solitary black hair

14:45.318 --> 14:48.531
on his ring finger
tied in a perfect bow.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.999
- A message?
- Yes.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.500
And a rather ingenious one.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.870
Made of DNA which the killer
wanted us to find.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.207
I took the liberty of removing
the follicular tail and sent it

14:58.231 --> 15:01.544
up to Ms. Sciuto for analysis.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.379
Abby?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.914
Hey, guys.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.248
Cool, huh?

15:06.272 --> 15:07.716
Yeah, if you like hair.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.019
I, um, I ran the sample...
when you pull

15:10.043 --> 15:11.387
a hair from your scalp,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.355
there's traces of blood
at the root.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.858
That blood, in this case,
was high in white blood cells...

15:15.882 --> 15:17.259
because your white count goes up

15:17.283 --> 15:19.028
when you're fighting
a serious injury or infection.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.596
Blood confirms
they needed a doctor.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.031
You got an I. D?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.867
I took the liberty of running
the DNA strand through CODIS

15:24.891 --> 15:26.669
and the Interpol DNA database.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.693
Got hits on both.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.709
Just like the director
predicted.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.064
It's Kai.

15:37.403 --> 15:38.838
Yeah.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.189
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.737
I'm not hungry.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.830
Well, don't have me get
worried about you now.

15:54.854 --> 15:59.101
There's plenty of other
things to worry about.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.888
Where'd you send the kids?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.306
Over to Alana's.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.774
They do movie night
with popcorn.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.877
Why don't we ever
do movie night?

16:07.901 --> 16:11.647
'Cause you ain't never home.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.663
- Yeah, well, there is that, isn't there?
-

16:15.942 --> 16:17.920
You know, when you called
and said you were

16:17.944 --> 16:20.022
coming home early,
I thought something was up.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.290
What's going on?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.092
I'm just thinking about things.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.718
What kind of things?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.170
How long this time, honey?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.071
Off and on since I got back

16:36.095 --> 16:37.706
- from Los Angeles.
- Please don't do this again.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.575
- Please don't do this again.
- It's not that easy.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.692
- Come on, please...
- Jackie, it's not that easy.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.848
You have a family.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.430
So did he.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.705
I'm taking dinner off.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.236
Hello?

17:07.260 --> 17:08.971
Hello, Leon.

17:08.994 --> 17:10.739
Happy to hear from me?

17:10.762 --> 17:15.010
First California, and now here.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.046
Washington's beautiful.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.881
How'd you get this number?

17:18.905 --> 17:22.151
Give a girl some credit.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.520
I've been doing this
for a while.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.223
You should know that
better than anyone.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.724
Every law enforcement officer

17:28.748 --> 17:31.660
in the national capital region
is looking for you, Kai.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.530
I'm flattered.

17:34.554 --> 17:39.116
But I only have eyes
for you, Director.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.272
McGee, got Kai on the director's

17:43.296 --> 17:44.673
home line right now.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.342
- Trace it.
- I'm on it.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.478
- DiNozzo, get somebody over there.
- It's rush hour, boss.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.813
She chose rush hour
just for this reason.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.815
Come on, McGee.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.183
Back-tracing the call.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.384
These land lines are slow.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.720
Keep talking, Leon.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.154
Just keep talking.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.856
I know you're hurt.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.524
I guarantee you,

18:02.548 --> 18:04.159
I'll take care of you.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.996
You'll be taken care of
if you turn yourself in.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.032
Turn myself in?

18:10.056 --> 18:11.767
You know I can't do that.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.702
We've been through this
before, Kai.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.672
In Munich, in Prague, in Tokyo.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.574
And to think

18:18.598 --> 18:21.010
you almost caught me
in Los Angeles.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.278
Give up.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.579
I can't.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.181
I have something I have to do.

18:26.205 --> 18:27.816
You might not get
another chance.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.418
Got it.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.819
- Boss.
- What do we got?

18:30.843 --> 18:34.574
She's right in front
of the director's house.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.831
Kai...

18:42.855 --> 18:44.433
you listen to me.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.435
You know this won't end well.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.872
And when it does...

18:49.896 --> 18:52.031
will you miss me?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.671
Hello?

19:04.210 --> 19:05.541
Can I help you?

19:08.848 --> 19:09.958
Jackie! Get back!

19:09.982 --> 19:11.117
Leon, what?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.183
Leon?

19:17.256 --> 19:19.435
Oh, my God.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.270
Who was that?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.371
Come on.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.953
Come on, let's go inside.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.614
Ziva will spend the night.

19:32.638 --> 19:33.816
No, she won't.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.051
Then we'll go to the safe house.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.386
We're not going anywhere.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.321
That's the wrong decision.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.925
It's the right decision for me.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.961
Agent David, will you
excuse us, please?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.463
Yes, sir.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.217
Gibbs, I'll be outside.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.001
Why run if you can't hide?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.771
No matter where we go,
it won't make any difference.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.339
Kai is that good.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.408
We'll handle it.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.710
Go.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.645
I can protect my own.

20:03.669 --> 20:06.882
I'll get Jackie and the kids
on the first plane out of here.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.066
No, you won't.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.620
'Cause I'm not going anywhere
without you.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.490
You know, Leon,
when you took this job,

20:14.514 --> 20:16.258
I knew that there
was risk involved,

20:16.282 --> 20:18.327
I knew I'd be watching
over my shoulder every day,

20:18.351 --> 20:20.496
but I always felt safe.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.798
Until now.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.434
And yeah, this woman may have

20:25.458 --> 20:28.170
killed your partner,

20:28.194 --> 20:30.706
but you're my partner now,

20:30.730 --> 20:34.461
and I'm not going anywhere.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.314
Round the clock,
at least two agents.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.883
Vehicle escorts, too.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.931
Done.

20:47.313 --> 20:50.192
Uh, boss, partial plate
Vance gave us

20:50.216 --> 20:51.693
belongs to a stolen car...

20:51.717 --> 20:53.362
Not surprised.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.832
Taken from a lot at Bingham
Air Field outside Fairfax.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.324
Think I just read something
in the paper about Bingham.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.805
Jason Cutler out of
Van Nuys, California,

21:02.829 --> 21:05.641
flew his private plane across
the country three days ago.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.109
After arriving safely
in Fairfax,

21:07.133 --> 21:08.911
family and friends
reported him missing.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.679
Tell Abby;
Dust the plane for prints.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.481
It looks like we found
Kai's flight.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.649
So, where's the pilot?

21:13.673 --> 21:15.150
Dead, most likely.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.552
He was Kai-jacked.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.854
Did you really just say that?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.022
I regret it already.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.657
Start digging
for anything on Kai.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.826
I've got calls into Baker at CIA
and Alterza at Interpol.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.227
Recall Special Agent Dunham.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.362
Tell him it's her.
He'll know why.

21:27.386 --> 21:28.410
Dunham?

21:34.060 --> 21:36.238
Amanda!

21:36.262 --> 21:37.573
Hey.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.342
- Hi.
- Um...

21:40.366 --> 21:42.377
I only have... like, 15 minutes.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.880
Let me guess. Work.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.716
You could have called.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.952
Yeah, but I...

21:49.976 --> 21:51.954
I wanted to see you.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.379
I figured that we
could at least talk.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.026
- Listen...
- What if we...

21:58.050 --> 21:59.261
Sorry.

21:59.285 --> 22:02.798
You want to go for a walk,
just for a few minutes?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.867
Where, to your office?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.301
Just around.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.770
We could get something to go.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.440
Like what?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.408
Garlic bread?

22:13.432 --> 22:15.043
Cannolis?

22:15.067 --> 22:18.580
Maybe we could
figure out dessert later.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.582
When you're done.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.284
It's gonna be late.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.299
Really late.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.923
Well, I have a paper due.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.325
I'll be up anyway.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.962
You want... you want me
to call you when I get home?

22:33.986 --> 22:35.464
Yup.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.499
I can come over.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.981
I mean... if you want me to.

22:48.301 --> 22:49.545
Morning.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.503
Heck of a day, isn't it?

22:52.772 --> 22:54.783
You went home?

22:54.807 --> 22:56.852
Oh, just for an hour.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.621
I've been talking to agents
all night, doing recon,

22:59.645 --> 23:02.257
and you went home and got
your game on with little...

23:02.281 --> 23:03.482
sexy Miss Text Message?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.495
Ziva, look at him.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.829
What are you talking about?

23:07.853 --> 23:10.032
He's oozing a musky,
caveman-esque,

23:10.056 --> 23:11.466
primitive satisfaction.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.602
Like Heston in
Planet of the Apes.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.538
And it didn't matter that that
world was ruled by orangutans,

23:16.562 --> 23:19.508
because Heston went straight for
the mute chick in the loincloth.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.944
You pulled a total Heston,
didn't you?

23:21.968 --> 23:23.278
I don't know about that.

23:23.302 --> 23:24.880
It was only a few minutes.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.050
Yeah. Sometimes
that's all it takes,

23:28.074 --> 23:29.952
in my middle-aged world.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.520
You are so jealous.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.889
Yes, I am, and there's
nothing wrong with that.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.057
I'm proud of Tim.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.692
I'm very proud of you.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.160
Did you take any pictures?

23:38.184 --> 23:39.515
Please.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.630
Well, I'm anxious to meet her.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.065
Make sure she's
good enough for you.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.467
She is definitely good enough.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.837
Conference room. Now.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.073
You folks sure
look better in person

23:51.097 --> 23:53.141
than on a laptop
7,000 miles away.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.010
Well, you look cleaner.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.645
Welcome home,
by the way, Agent David.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.413
I haven't had a chance
to say that yet.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.549
Thank you for your help
during the mission,

24:00.573 --> 24:01.617
Agent Dunham.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.042
Anything to help a lady.

24:04.343 --> 24:07.122
Uh, well, you... you did
help us out there, pal.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.290
Thanks.

24:08.314 --> 24:09.679
Happy to oblige.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.362
Lee Wuan Kai.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.097
Director's been assembling

24:15.121 --> 24:17.214
a file for years,
but you, Dunham...

24:19.225 --> 24:21.403
you have had firsthand exposure.

24:21.427 --> 24:22.904
Yeah, early in my career.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.473
My second
foreign field assignment

24:24.497 --> 24:25.807
was in the demilitarized zone

24:25.831 --> 24:27.242
outside of Pyongyang,
North Korea.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.378
Does that mean you monitored
the Chinese border?

24:29.402 --> 24:30.946
Movement along the Amnok River.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.914
Kim Jong-II had an agreement
with the Chinese.

24:32.938 --> 24:34.383
Let his ops use the river

24:34.407 --> 24:36.718
to exit the country, and
he'd make it worth their while

24:36.742 --> 24:38.220
with a whole lot
of government-grown opium.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.788
One of those ops was Kai?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.390
She was the boss's go-to.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.592
And who could blame him, right?
Kai was the best.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.394
In the early '80s, an ambitious

24:45.418 --> 24:47.396
upper-level minister started
training young girls,

24:47.420 --> 24:50.132
orphans mostly,
to kill for the cause.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.567
They fed 'em,
housed 'em, gave 'em

24:52.591 --> 24:53.935
a life worth living, sort of.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.904
I've done a little research
on my own,

24:55.928 --> 24:57.372
and based on what I've gathered,

24:57.396 --> 24:58.807
Kai was brainwashed.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.909
Started off innocent, but, uh,

25:00.933 --> 25:03.211
when the others cracked,
she didn't.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.981
Shor. In Hebrew,
it means the bull. Stubborn.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.582
It is why she's so good.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.718
You should know.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.721
Is that why she's here?
For Vance?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.056
Uh, doubtful.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.458
Well, I made some calls,
talked to CIA.

25:16.482 --> 25:19.795
Evidently, old reliable
isn't what she used to be.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.463
Government's losing patience
with her.

25:21.487 --> 25:22.964
- Name?
- It's probably.

25:22.988 --> 25:24.599
Pak Su Ji...
he's an old lieutenant,

25:24.623 --> 25:26.635
been around since day one
of the program.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.737
Now he's retired,
part of a permanent mission

25:28.761 --> 25:30.739
to the U.N.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.175
You know, it's funny
that Kai's here,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.577
and he just checked
into a downtown hotel,

25:35.601 --> 25:37.592
don't y'all think?

25:42.441 --> 25:44.519
It's in your blood, isn't it?

25:44.543 --> 25:45.754
What is?

25:45.778 --> 25:48.557
You're thinking
of how you'd get him.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.692
Maybe some intense mind games,

25:50.716 --> 25:52.728
followed by...

25:52.752 --> 25:53.995
sheer force?

25:54.019 --> 25:57.466
Go for the jugular
or the slow kill.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.601
You're a dangerous woman.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.902
Who am I getting?

26:00.926 --> 26:02.137
Agent Dunham?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.039
Why would you want Dunham?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.641
I thought we were talking
about Pak Su Ji.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.877
Dunham is from Texas;
I like Texas.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.879
What is that saying anyway?
Um...

26:10.903 --> 26:13.348
He... cleans up nice.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.983
Not that nice.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.152
I thought he was kind of creepy.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.321
Oh, come on, stop being
such a big brother.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.857
He's a field agent, a nomad.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.859
I've had enough
of that in my life.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.660
I came to NCIS to...

26:25.684 --> 26:27.462
settle down,

26:27.486 --> 26:30.265
to make a home for myself.

26:30.289 --> 26:34.360
The last thing I need
is a Chad Dunham.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.197
- However...
- What?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.380
Well, to answer your question,

26:45.404 --> 26:47.249
how would I...

26:47.273 --> 26:49.818
get him.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.487
Brute force is very intriguing.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.689
And who exactly are we
talking about right now,

26:54.713 --> 26:56.510
Pak Su Ji or the Texas Longhorn?

27:03.155 --> 27:06.601
So, why am I looking at a bullet
from an L.A. case file?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.036
Because it's different

27:08.060 --> 27:10.505
than the slugs that Kai used
to kill Cirreux.

27:10.529 --> 27:11.740
Normally, she uses

27:11.764 --> 27:13.642
a larger caliber...
this one was planned

27:13.666 --> 27:16.545
for specific damage,
so Ducky was right.

27:16.569 --> 27:19.581
So that means the ballistics
report is not done yet?

27:19.605 --> 27:21.183
Uh, nope, it's not done.

27:21.207 --> 27:25.253
Okay. Guess
I'll come back later.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.421
Hey, McGee?

27:26.445 --> 27:27.656
Yeah?

27:27.680 --> 27:30.225
You look, um, happy.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.227
I do?

27:32.251 --> 27:33.628
Yeah.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.631
It's, uh, it's becoming,
actually.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.466
You're, like, confident.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.436
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

27:41.460 --> 27:43.271
No.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.973
You sure?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.174
N-Nothing's new?

27:46.198 --> 27:47.688
Nothing at all?

27:48.734 --> 27:51.032
I started seeing someone.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.548
I know.

27:53.572 --> 27:56.017
And I'm thrilled; I totally am.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.386
I was just waiting
for you to say it.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.921
Word travels fast.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.122
Well, tell me about her.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.491
No. You know what?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.093
Don't. You don't have to.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.494
I'm just...

28:06.518 --> 28:09.097
I think it's excellent.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.089
Thanks, Abby.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.203
Hey, you know, Eric
from the L.A. office,

28:15.227 --> 28:18.306
he's been, like, crazy helpful
with this whole Kai thing.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.108
That's... that's great.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.644
I haven't m-met him yet.
You've met him.

28:22.668 --> 28:24.613
I've only been
to California once,

28:24.637 --> 28:26.181
for my second cousin's wedding.

28:26.205 --> 28:29.084
But I don't really remember
my second cousin's wedding,

28:29.108 --> 28:30.986
'cause I was six, and I had this

28:31.010 --> 28:32.554
weird allergic reaction
to avocados, and...

28:32.578 --> 28:35.657
Abby, I really got
to get back upstairs.

28:35.681 --> 28:38.226
Right. D-Definitely.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.241
Just let me know
when the report's done.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.613
Hey, congrats again.

28:51.764 --> 28:55.176
You expect me to contact
the North Koreans and say what?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.245
Kai might be here
to kill one of their own.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.813
- Based on?
- A theory.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.482
A hunch.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.183
Just because Pak Su Ji's in town

29:02.207 --> 29:03.652
doesn't make him
Kai's next target.

29:03.676 --> 29:05.487
Besides, why would
they ever listen?

29:05.511 --> 29:07.455
Why not?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.691
What is she doing, Gibbs?

29:09.715 --> 29:11.326
She came to my house.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.428
She could have killed me,
but she didn't.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.530
It's like she's playing
some kind of game.

29:15.554 --> 29:16.731
How long have you
known her, Leon?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.366
- Too long.
- You're the constant.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.634
No, I'm the enemy.

29:19.658 --> 29:20.802
Are you?

29:20.826 --> 29:22.203
What is she doing?

29:22.227 --> 29:24.205
What does she really want?

29:24.229 --> 29:26.932
You know her well; You tell me.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.312
I'm, uh, sorry, Director.
The TV...

29:30.336 --> 29:32.167
turn it on.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.016
Live to Guy Ross

29:35.040 --> 29:36.418
for the latest
on the Capitol shooting.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.754
Sniper fire just steps
from the nation's capitol.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.656
Shortly before 3:00 p.m.
this afternoon,

29:41.680 --> 29:44.526
shots were fired at former
North Korean official Pak Su Ji.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.727
The retired military officer

29:45.751 --> 29:48.763
and one-time key figure
in North Korean politics

29:48.787 --> 29:50.031
arrived in town yesterday

29:50.055 --> 29:53.268
to participate
in a United Nations open forum.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.171
Metro police and FBI
are on the scene.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.439
An ambulance took Pak Su Ji

29:57.463 --> 29:59.007
to nearby
Monroe University Hospital,

29:59.031 --> 30:01.276
where's he's being rushed
into surgery right now.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.212
A citywide manhunt
is underway for the shooter.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.381
Police are asking anyone
who was in the Capitol area

30:06.405 --> 30:08.205
who may have seen something
to come forward...

30:16.715 --> 30:19.327
At 2:51
this afternoon, Pak Su Ji...

30:19.351 --> 30:21.797
Pak Su Ji is still alive.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.533
He was hit by two long-range,
seven-millimeter sniper rounds.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.034
He's in surgery as we speak.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.069
- Any details?
- Metro PD,

30:28.093 --> 30:29.638
FBI are scouring the area.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.039
Nothing left behind,
nothing found.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.008
Well, she is the best.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.476
No, she's not.
The guy's still alive.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.378
Maybe Kai really
is off her game.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.013
So who is next?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.381
Well, Kai's an assassin, right?

30:39.405 --> 30:41.716
She shoots people.
We know she's here

30:41.740 --> 30:43.852
because she turned up
outside the director's house.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.687
And then there was that
first victim, the doctor.

30:45.711 --> 30:48.256
And now she's gunned down
this government stooge?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.491
There's got to be a pattern.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.892
So if she's not working

30:50.916 --> 30:52.727
for her country anymore,
who is she killing for?

30:52.751 --> 30:54.548
Vance.

30:55.788 --> 30:57.265
Yeah.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.633
Right away.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.235
That was the State Department.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.037
There's a message for us

31:02.061 --> 31:04.105
from the North Koreans.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.308
Director Vance,
Special Agent Gibbs.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.076
What can we do for you, ma'am?

31:08.100 --> 31:09.911
The North Koreans
have contacted us

31:09.935 --> 31:11.246
through back channels.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.881
They are saddened
about today's events,

31:12.905 --> 31:15.450
and they are well aware
of your ongoing relationship

31:15.474 --> 31:17.385
with former operative
Lee Wuan Kai.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.553
Former?

31:18.577 --> 31:19.955
That is correct.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.324
They give their word
that if she is responsible

31:22.348 --> 31:24.326
in any way
for the recent bloodshed,

31:24.350 --> 31:26.695
it is against the wishes
of their government.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.029
If that's true,

31:28.053 --> 31:30.131
will the North Koreans
help us capture her?

31:30.155 --> 31:32.467
Absolutely, Director,
and then prosecute her

31:32.491 --> 31:35.570
to the fullest extent
of their laws and ours.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.105
It's almost like.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.940
Kai's dangling it in his face.

31:38.964 --> 31:42.677
Like she's saying,
"Here I am, Director.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.247
I shot another one."

31:45.271 --> 31:47.382
"Look at me, Ma.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.718
Top of the world."

31:49.742 --> 31:50.785
Who was that?

31:50.809 --> 31:52.754
It was Cagney in White Heat.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.522
Oh, that's the one
with the ballet dancers.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.957
That's White Nights,
with Gregory Hines

31:55.981 --> 31:56.992
and Mikhail Baryshnikov.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.460
Anyway,

31:58.484 --> 32:00.829
maybe Kai was just trying
to impress him.

32:00.853 --> 32:01.997
There is nothing impressive

32:02.021 --> 32:03.461
about killing people,
Tony, trust me.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.592
Hmm, McGee,
your McSqueeze is here.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.806
Amanda? How'd she get upstairs?

32:11.830 --> 32:12.974
Oh, Security called.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.295
I said, bring her on up.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.278
Surprise, surprise.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.215
I got your text,
but I wanted to say good night.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.216
Um,

32:21.240 --> 32:23.285
Amanda, these are, uh,

32:23.309 --> 32:25.220
my coworkers. This is Tony.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.221
Hi.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.355
And this is Ziva.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.723
Hi there.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.926
Hi. It is a pleasure
to meet you.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.128
- She's lying.
- I am not.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.330
Would you like a slice of pizza?

32:35.354 --> 32:36.531
Um, sure, yeah.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.999
Actually, on second thought,

32:38.023 --> 32:40.435
McGee, why don't you take her
on a tour of the facility?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.671
Oh, yeah, that would be awesome.

32:42.695 --> 32:44.697
Also, the copy room door
locks from the inside.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.311
You know what, we actually have
a lot of work to do, Amanda.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.379
So I'm going to have to
take you back downstairs.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.982
Okay. Um, well,
it was nice to meet you.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.940
Nice to meet you, too. Bye.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.789
Well, they seem good together.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.824
Like it was meant to be.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.941
If you believe
in that kind of thing.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.800
Did I embarrass you?

33:11.824 --> 33:13.168
No.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.437
No, they're-they're my friends.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.905
They seem great.

33:16.929 --> 33:19.007
Maybe we could all
go out sometime.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.809
Maybe.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.011
When we are done.

33:23.035 --> 33:26.014
Done with what?

33:26.038 --> 33:27.849
Right.

33:27.873 --> 33:29.864
No questions.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.282
Coffee. Tomorrow morning.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.150
I'll be there.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.512
Traffic should be pretty light
tonight, gentlemen.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.527
Let's go home.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.254
Vance.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.348
When did he pass away?

34:33.371 --> 34:34.916
- Interesting.
- What?

34:34.940 --> 34:36.351
Well, I'm comparing.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.386
Pak Su Ji's toxicology report
to Cirreux's.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.121
They both contracted hand, foot,
mouth virus late in life.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.358
It's common with kids
but not with adults.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.193
Did you know it stays dormant
in the body?

34:45.217 --> 34:46.694
That why you called me
down here, Abby?

34:46.717 --> 34:48.530
No, I called you down here
because of this.

34:48.554 --> 34:52.067
Pak Su Ji did not die
from his gunshot wounds, Gibbs.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.333
Something in his bloodstream

34:53.358 --> 34:55.870
triggered a massive heart attack
after surgery.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.306
Something invisible that never
had the chance to spread

34:58.330 --> 34:59.607
- through the doctor.
- Something like?

34:59.631 --> 35:00.942
Poison.

35:00.966 --> 35:04.179
Both Kai's.22 rounds
and the rifle slugs

35:04.203 --> 35:05.747
were dipped in a lethal toxin

35:05.771 --> 35:07.449
called Atropa Belladonna.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.984
Never trust a beautiful woman.

35:10.008 --> 35:13.154
Whoever shot Cirreux
also shot the North Korean.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.690
And wanted to make sure that if
the bullets didn't kill him,

35:15.714 --> 35:16.925
the poison would.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.293
Backup system.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.627
She created her own fail-safe.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.482
What are you hiding?

35:24.523 --> 35:25.834
Oh, no!

35:25.858 --> 35:27.655
It's too late. I can't.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.305
Gibbs...

35:30.329 --> 35:32.540
you are an enabler.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.555
And I love you for it.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.339
Hey.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.409
Gosh, you look beat.
Let's go sit down.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.992
Are you okay?

35:51.016 --> 35:52.994
I've been up all night.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.009
Why? What happened?

35:56.355 --> 35:57.966
Come on, you're scaring me, Tim.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.321
What... what is it?

36:00.359 --> 36:02.337
Last night...

36:02.361 --> 36:04.873
last night, something
didn't seem right.

36:04.897 --> 36:06.875
I know. You were busy.

36:06.899 --> 36:08.943
I shouldn't have come
to visit. I'm sorry.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.479
Amanda, how'd you know
where I work?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.281
You told me.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.450
You said you worked at NCIS.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.118
I asked you, and you told me.

36:17.142 --> 36:18.386
I remember exactly
what you said.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.655
No. I never tell people that.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.923
I give them cell numbers.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.225
I give them beepers.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.807
But you knew.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.496
Where's Kai?

36:28.520 --> 36:29.864
What'd you say?

36:29.888 --> 36:30.899
Where is she, Tim?

36:30.923 --> 36:32.066
I need to know.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.669
Tell me right now
where you think Kai is

36:34.693 --> 36:36.388
or I swear I'll...

36:38.430 --> 36:39.692
Amanda?

36:41.433 --> 36:42.695
Amanda!

36:56.949 --> 36:59.427
Amanda's real name
was Juliet Tippon.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.442
She was born in South Africa.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.299
She worked
for her own government

37:04.323 --> 37:06.000
before hanging up
a freelance shingle.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.322
North Koreans hired her
to get Kai before we could.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.705
Why?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.840
For fear that Kai might give up
and join us.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.409
Tell us what she knows.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.844
- Amanda was going to kill me.
- Yeah.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.746
Sure.
If you didn't give her Kai.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.738
Instead, Kai saved your life.

37:26.979 --> 37:28.947
She left this in my car
last night.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.392
Why save an NCIS agent?

37:31.416 --> 37:34.112
Why send these messages?

37:36.221 --> 37:38.166
Gonna join a monastery.

37:38.190 --> 37:40.568
Connect Cirreux to Pak Su Ji.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.403
Well, the poison's new.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.972
It's not part
of Kai's previous MO.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.274
It's two targets
from two different worlds.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.042
Both old guys, lots of money,

37:48.066 --> 37:49.377
homes in multiple countries.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.878
Both womanizers.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.893
But no kids.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.619
What'd you say?

37:57.643 --> 37:59.053
They-They don't have kids.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.321
Some people don't like rug rats.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.789
Both have a kids' disease.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.157
- Why?
- Well, they both

38:03.181 --> 38:04.459
had hand, foot, mouth virus,
so they

38:04.483 --> 38:06.212
had to be exposed at some point.

38:10.188 --> 38:11.499
I hate it when he does that.

38:11.523 --> 38:14.068
It's totally unsatisfying.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.370
What do we know

38:15.394 --> 38:16.904
about the training program
that recruited Kai?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.206
Whole team of people.

38:18.230 --> 38:20.975
Military, doctors,
government types.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.610
Abbs, bring up the group shot.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.794
Yep.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.515
That photo's 30 years old.
That's Kai.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.063
Right there in the middle.

38:36.882 --> 38:40.461
And this...
is a young Pak Su Ji.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.180
And this...

38:45.223 --> 38:46.247
Is Dr. Cirreux.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.405
She's murdering the men
who did this to her.

38:50.429 --> 38:53.091
Who turned her into a killer.

38:55.067 --> 38:58.012
Why, indeed?

38:58.036 --> 39:01.096
To think of the loss
that could have been avoided.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.452
So, what now, Duck?

39:04.476 --> 39:07.455
Does she keep hunting down
the people who did this to her?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.090
I doubt there are any left.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.592
Cirreux was their
medical consultant.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.995
He physically robbed her
of her childhood.

39:14.019 --> 39:18.456
He turned weak little girls
into coldhearted killers.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.803
Pak Su Ji?

39:21.827 --> 39:23.104
Well, the father figure.

39:23.128 --> 39:26.708
The puppet master for Kai,
the Frankenstein.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.676
For her, those two

39:28.700 --> 39:30.678
were the responsible
parental figures.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.180
What about Vance?

39:32.204 --> 39:35.783
Well, all her life,
she was pursued by one man.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.720
Not physically or sexually,
of course, but mentally.

39:38.744 --> 39:41.556
He chased her...
courted her, you might say.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.857
Remember,

39:42.881 --> 39:44.826
she's probably never
had a relationship.

39:44.850 --> 39:48.262
She doesn't know what it's like
to love or be loved.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.264
My fear now

39:50.288 --> 39:53.067
is that she'll probably turn
to him for help.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.070
I mean, in her mind,

39:56.094 --> 39:58.573
he's been her partner
in all this.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.929
The one man she can count on.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.813
Jackie?

40:05.837 --> 40:07.181
Where the hell are the agents?

40:07.205 --> 40:08.925
They're never supposed
to leave the front...

40:10.742 --> 40:12.453
Sweetheart?

40:12.477 --> 40:14.522
What's going on?

40:14.546 --> 40:16.275
I'm okay.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.966
Hello, Leon.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.101
Where are my children?

40:27.125 --> 40:29.070
Gone.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.972
I waited for them to leave.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.040
This isn't about them.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.942
And the agents?

40:34.966 --> 40:36.544
Tranquilized.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.212
They won't be happy
when they wake up,

40:38.236 --> 40:41.149
but considering
the alternative...

40:41.173 --> 40:43.300
You're changing, Kai.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.521
Not enough.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.589
It's too late.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.658
Let my wife go.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.445
In time.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.464
She's lucky to have you.

40:56.488 --> 40:59.434
We know about the doctor
and Pak Su Ji.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.551
We know what they did to you.

41:03.495 --> 41:06.474
I don't think you
can possibly imagine.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.477
You saved one of my agents.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.679
He didn't deserve to die.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.714
The girl did.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.763
It doesn't have to end
like this, Kai.

41:16.808 --> 41:20.621
My life ended 30 years ago.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.125
You think it matters
what happens now?

41:25.484 --> 41:28.129
I'm counting on you, Leon.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.798
You're counting on me for what?

41:30.822 --> 41:33.814
To do what you did before.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.472
Everyone said I missed.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.555
You should be dead.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.511
I was already dead.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.847
Kai, stop this.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.415
Please.

41:47.439 --> 41:49.498
I can't.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.908
I can help you.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.624
Just being there
all these years,

41:56.648 --> 41:58.726
you already have.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.863
You have to finish it, Leon.

42:01.887 --> 42:03.798
Do it for me.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.084
For your partner.

42:28.046 --> 42:32.560
Anyone can achieve
their fullest potential.

42:32.584 --> 42:34.862
Who we are might
be predetermined,

42:34.886 --> 42:38.766
but the path we follow
is always of our own choosing.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.968
We should never allow our fears

42:40.992 --> 42:43.404
or the expectations of others

42:43.428 --> 42:46.727
to set the frontiers
of our destiny.

42:52.537 --> 42:55.283
Your destiny can't be changed,

42:55.307 --> 42:57.685
but it can be challenged.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.922
Every man is born as many men

43:00.946 --> 43:03.471
and dies as a single one.
