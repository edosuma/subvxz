WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.158
(Audrey): Previously on Haven...

00:02.295 --> 00:03.876
- We found William's aether.

00:04.005 --> 00:06.417
Charlotte said if she has aether.
she can make a cure.

00:06.549 --> 00:09.165
- There's not nearly enough.
- Look over there.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.842
- I don't believe it.
Nathan was right.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.381
I can end the Troubles.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.428
- Check it out.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.348
- "A man in North Carolina
claims he can remove

00:21.480 --> 00:23.857
the black tar of evil."
You think this is for real?

00:23.983 --> 00:25.223
- Think it's worth a road trip.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.271
(Vince): That word, "Croatoan,"
we found it again,

00:28.404 --> 00:29.905
here, carved in a rock.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.147
We're afraid it might be
some kind of warning,

00:32.283 --> 00:33.363
that whatever it is...

00:34.744 --> 00:35.733
we're next.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.755
(screaming)

00:48.007 --> 00:52.250
(screaming)

00:56.724 --> 00:59.682
(clock ticking)

01:01.479 --> 01:03.595
- That was only a half
an hour ago.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.852
That woman
might still be alive.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.976
Vincent!
I had another vision.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.357
We got to go.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.741
(bell tolling)

01:23.292 --> 01:25.408
- Please say
that coffee's for me.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.921
- Yeah. And it comes with an apology.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.046
Nathan called.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.712
Some lunatic downtown's
stirring up a crowd.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.256
Probablyjust a drunk,
but it could be a problem.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.756
- It's fine. I have to meet up
with Audrey anyway.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.383
If we're gonna find
a cure for the Troubles,

01:42.520 --> 01:45.102
the first step is converting
William's aether stash.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.641
- You make it sound so easy,

01:46.774 --> 01:48.765
but if you and Audrey can pull it off...

01:48.901 --> 01:50.937
- Then no more shroud,

01:51.070 --> 01:52.526
no more Troubles.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.566
We get to live
happily ever after.

01:59.954 --> 02:03.242
- You know, I hope you're still saying that
a couple of decades from now.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.910
I don't mean to spook you,

02:05.042 --> 02:08.660
but I'll be hunched over a walker,
and you'll still be what you are.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.538
- Don't worry.

02:12.091 --> 02:15.208
I got a thing for older men.
(chuckles)

02:19.807 --> 02:21.422
- I can hear them approaching.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.054
The end...
It isn't coming.

02:24.937 --> 02:28.020
The end...
It's already here.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.559
Why can't you hear?

02:29.692 --> 02:31.899
- Is this a Trouble,
orjust run-of—the-mill crazy?

02:32.028 --> 02:34.269
- I don't know.
- Why can't you hear?

02:34.405 --> 02:35.770
The galloping hooves,

02:35.906 --> 02:37.942
the horsemen
of the apocalypse!

02:38.075 --> 02:41.613
- Okay, uh, get these people
to head home. We'll take care of him.

02:41.746 --> 02:44.704
- They're coming!
Why can't you hear?

02:45.333 --> 02:48.450
- l... I don't hear anything.

02:48.586 --> 02:51.544
(horses neighing)

02:51.672 --> 02:53.208
Your tattoo...

02:53.341 --> 02:56.629
It's the lucky number seven, right?
So I think you're gonna be fine.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.046
- They're coming!

02:58.179 --> 02:59.965
They're here!

03:00.097 --> 03:03.385
(horses neighing, snorting)

03:04.935 --> 03:06.846
(Dwight): What the hell?

03:11.776 --> 03:13.357
Oh, my God.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.647
Was he trampled?

03:15.780 --> 03:16.895
By horses?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.817
- And he heard them coming.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.374
(somber folk music)

04:02.910 --> 04:06.619
(Audrey): So what are we supposed to do...
Just wave our arms a bit, and, poof,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.955
we've converted the aether?
- If only it were that easy.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.699
This is just the first step.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.667
And it's just a theory.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.588
Truth is, I've never even seen
this much aether before,

04:18.008 --> 04:19.384
much less controlled it.

04:26.851 --> 04:32.596
But I believe we can condense
all this aether into a single form.

04:32.731 --> 04:36.269
And that will be the first piece
in creating a new Barn.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.358
- A new Barn?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.233
I thought the Barn was designed
to kill everyone with a Trouble.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.073
- It was, but our new Barn...

04:45.202 --> 04:46.578
It'll be a cure.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.278
People don't have to die.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.531
You don't have
to leave Haven with it.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.043
(Audrey): That's great.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.667
- Don't start celebrating yet.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.710
I never said
it was gonna be easy.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.220
(sighs)

05:09.101 --> 05:11.558
- Are you sure
this is the right place?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.599
- Pretty sure.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.976
Oh.

05:19.904 --> 05:22.611
- No marks,
just like all the others.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.946
(clatter)

05:24.074 --> 05:25.575
- You hear that?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.166
(clatter)

05:36.295 --> 05:39.253
The woman... She's alive.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.339
- W-what if it's not her?

05:42.468 --> 05:44.675
What if it's the killer
in there waiting?

05:44.803 --> 05:49.388
- Vincent, someone who actually
saw Haven's serial killer

05:49.517 --> 05:51.803
could be suffocating to death
behind that door.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.426
We've got to get her out.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.982
- Oh, my God.
- Are you all right?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.237
- Where...

06:02.363 --> 06:03.648
- How on Earth
did you escape?

06:03.781 --> 06:06.318
- Could you describe his face?
- What did he look like?

06:06.450 --> 06:07.986
- What are you talking about?

06:08.661 --> 06:10.822
I can't even remember
how I got here.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.198
- And she doesn't remember
anything?

06:16.335 --> 06:18.246
- No, she's lost time.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.415
- Just like all of us back
in the cave where Jennifer died.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.961
- And everyone on the beach
where we found the Colorado Kid.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.254
Another dead end.

06:26.387 --> 06:30.130
- Maybe not. Unlike us, this
just happened to her. Bring in Gloria.

06:30.266 --> 06:33.224
Maybe she can do something...
Help her recover that lost time.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.560
I'll check back later.
I got Troubles to deal with.

06:36.689 --> 06:37.929
(cell phone beeps)

06:38.065 --> 06:41.182
So second one
in as many hours.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.400
- Looks like this guy
was struck by lightning,

06:43.529 --> 06:44.985
burned, and...

06:46.156 --> 06:47.566
fell from a skyscraper.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.576
Look at this.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.780
Roman numeral...
Just like our guy this morning.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.700
- Yeah, but he looked like he got
run over by a horse and carriage.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.198
- Different numbers,
different effect.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.325
- So you think this Trouble
marks its victims?

06:59.920 --> 07:05.210
- Maybe... which means our victims
might have a mutual friend.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.209
- Maybe our Troubled person
is on here... or the next victims.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.881
- I'll have someone
check the names

07:10.014 --> 07:12.175
with the records we salvaged
from the police station.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.848
Wish we still had
a database.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.686
It'd be much easier if we had
contact with the outside world.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.769
(Duke): I know there's a guy here
who can supposedly fix me,

07:22.901 --> 07:25.153
but I don't understand how
driving 30 miles

07:25.279 --> 07:26.985
in the wrong direction
is a shortcut.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.900
- Okay, well, technically
a shortcut is defined

07:29.033 --> 07:30.318
as time spent traveling.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.987
So, when you're driving
with expired plates

07:32.119 --> 07:34.656
and no insurance in a van
that doesn't go over 50,

07:34.788 --> 07:37.621
then avoiding cop-infested
interstates is a shortcut.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.241
And, you know, may I add
that we made it,

07:40.377 --> 07:41.787
so maybe we shouldn't
be complaining.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.876
Oh, thanks, dude.
We're good for gas.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.003
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, maybe we'll just...

07:49.136 --> 07:51.502
We'll just... we'll just top it up
and, you know,

07:51.639 --> 07:53.095
maybe just...
Just check the oil

07:53.223 --> 07:56.966
or whatever it is
that you do.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.217
Thanks.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.564
- What do you think?
Is that my healer?

08:05.069 --> 08:08.653
- I don't know.
He looks old...

08:08.781 --> 08:10.362
kind of magical.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.574
Then again, all old people
pretty much look that way, so...

08:14.787 --> 08:17.745
I don't know, dude. Is he supposed
to be wearing a wizard hat?

08:18.999 --> 08:22.992
- | just hope this guy can get all these
Troubles the hell out of me.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.413
Howdy.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.838
We heard that we might be able
to find someone here, uh...

08:33.847 --> 08:35.178
a healer.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.348
- This look like
a hospital to you?

08:38.477 --> 08:39.683
- No, it doesn't.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.263
But someone around here
is claiming that they can...

08:45.442 --> 08:47.819
draw the evil black tar
out of the cursed.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.103
That's me... cursed.

08:52.324 --> 08:56.943
So what do you say? Can you tell me
something about that?

08:57.079 --> 08:59.616
- Same thing I tell
all the others.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.536
There is no magic cure
for your sins.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.545
Whatever you've done,

09:06.964 --> 09:07.999
that's on you.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.707
Save your money.
Keep driving.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.762
- You were a half quart low.
I left the keys in the visor.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.097
- Okay. Thanks.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.012
- It was a waste of time.

09:31.155 --> 09:34.318
- Oh, dude.
Check it out.

09:35.159 --> 09:37.741
Looks like your healer found us.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.206
- I'll check in later, Parker.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.210
Sounds like Audrey and Charlotte
have their work cut out for them.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.498
- Well, that sucks.
Think it was a Trouble?

09:53.677 --> 09:56.840
- Sometimes in this town,
you forget about plain old bad luck.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.593
(groans)

10:04.730 --> 10:06.516
- What's wrong?

10:07.024 --> 10:09.766
Damn.
Where'd you get that?

10:09.902 --> 10:13.394
- It's weird. I'm not sure.
It hurts like hell.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.945
- You know, these, uh...

10:16.283 --> 10:18.865
These women
from other worlds, they're...

10:20.204 --> 10:21.694
they're not like other girls.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.454
(groans)

10:24.583 --> 10:25.868
(chuckles)

10:26.376 --> 10:28.162
Maybe you're not
cut out for it.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.501
- Oh, yeah?

10:30.714 --> 10:31.794
About that...

10:33.842 --> 10:35.378
You and Audrey...

10:36.637 --> 10:38.753
with her never aging, do you, uh...

10:39.890 --> 10:41.426
you ever worry about...

10:44.812 --> 10:47.224
Do you think Charlotte
and I can make it work?

10:47.898 --> 10:50.059
- I think if you're asking, then...

10:50.651 --> 10:52.607
you already know the answer.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.658
(groans)

11:01.912 --> 11:03.152
(grunts)

11:06.083 --> 11:09.416
- The bolt broke.
Not my lucky day.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.254
Dwight...

11:18.637 --> 11:20.218
we have a problem.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.973
- This Trouble...

11:25.102 --> 11:28.185
Whatever it is,
it's coming for us.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.739
See? Relatively simple...

11:48.876 --> 11:51.208
with just one, anyway.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.125
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.626
Are you okay?
- I hope so.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.844
A little light-headed is all.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.339
- Oh. Ah.
(exhales sharply)

12:05.475 --> 12:07.181
- What is it? What's wrong?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.347
- Gah!

12:10.480 --> 12:12.186
My eyes.
I can...

12:12.316 --> 12:14.147
I can barely see.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.272
- Oh, my God,
what's happening to us?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.369
- And Audrey's got one too?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.159
- Same place,
different number.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.908
She’s going blind,
and I feel drained.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.457
- I feel like someone
is beating the hell out of me.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.830
- So this Trouble's affecting
people all over town?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.081
- Don ’t know,

12:39.217 --> 12:40.957
but with my injuries
and Nathan's bad luck,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.085
the job's not getting any easier.
- Same here.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.054
Converting the aether...
it's a tall order

12:46.183 --> 12:48.515
if Audrey can ’t see
and I feel like hell.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.509
(groans)

12:50.646 --> 12:51.977
- Dwight?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.521
- What if that's the whole point?

12:55.651 --> 12:57.266
What if it’s not random?

12:57.402 --> 12:58.562
What if we're being targeted?

12:58.695 --> 13:02.779
- Because someone's trying to stop us
from building the new Barn.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.193
- Put a rush job on the aether.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.068
We'll find whoever's Trouble this is
before it takes us out.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.780
(cell phone beeps)
- Thanks for the help, Rafferty.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.495
Our victim's list
of mystery names...

13:14.628 --> 13:15.993
They're all occult authors,

13:16.129 --> 13:17.539
write about the meaning
of the Tarot.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.209
- Tarot cards.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.706
Numbered like
a regular deck of cards

13:20.842 --> 13:22.707
only with Roman numerals.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.220
Ex-girlfriend...

13:24.346 --> 13:25.552
from Seattle.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.717
- So let's start talking
to palm readers.

13:32.187 --> 13:37.602
- Okay, so, Sam, how does this,
um, work exactly?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.725
- The first step
in the healing process...

13:40.612 --> 13:43.900
is truly wanting to get better,
believing that you can.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.481
Looking in your eyes,

13:46.618 --> 13:48.404
I know you do.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.071
Now stand up
and open your shirt.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.752
Addictions, anger.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.586
But for some of us,

14:05.887 --> 14:08.629
our curses
are more tangible.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.426
They cannot be overcome.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.097
They must be extracted.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.600
- Uh... Mm.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.821
- And that is my curse,

14:26.950 --> 14:28.281
my burden...

14:29.286 --> 14:33.154
to draw the darkness
from others.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.282
(grunting)

14:42.924 --> 14:44.664
(Seth): lt's black.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.470
(panting)

14:57.522 --> 14:58.853
That”

14:58.982 --> 15:00.518
W88...

15:00.650 --> 15:02.106
amazing.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.817
- Listen, boys,
I'd love to help

15:07.949 --> 15:10.201
you poke around
that woman's brain.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.534
But the morgue, my lab,
thanks to a Trouble,

15:12.662 --> 15:15.074
they're still overrun
by poison gas with a face.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.913
- There must be something
you can do.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.748
- Well, I did get intern

15:18.877 --> 15:21.914
to lug out this old
EEG machine of mine.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.537
Thing's a blast at parties.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.005
If we use it on somebody
who's lost time

15:26.134 --> 15:28.750
and discover atrophy
in the hippocampus,

15:28.887 --> 15:31.754
that's physiological evidence
of memory loss.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.506
- If that's true,
can you reverse the effect?

15:34.643 --> 15:36.554
- Maybe.
But I don't even know

15:36.686 --> 15:38.677
if this thing's safe
to use anymore.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.138
Who wants to go first?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.534
- Damn it.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.287
How am I supposed
to control something

15:58.416 --> 15:59.622
when I can barely see.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.582
- You've done this before.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.247
You've told me about it.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.541
When you were on that hill
with William,

16:05.674 --> 16:09.212
when his men made of aether
were gonna kill Nathan,

16:09.886 --> 16:11.262
you stopped them.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.595
You controlled it.
You can do this again.

16:15.559 --> 16:20.053
- Listen, maybe we should,
you know, take a break.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.606
ljust feel like
we're spinning our wheels.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.229
Are we going about this
aether thing all wrong?

16:31.366 --> 16:33.072
- I don't know.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.577
Mara knew
what she was doing,

16:34.703 --> 16:37.866
but she learned everything
from her...

16:41.209 --> 16:42.710
- Her father?

16:43.962 --> 16:45.793
My father.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.380
- He was a great scientist.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.379
He had an incredible mind.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.762
But his research...
He...

16:56.349 --> 16:57.634
went too far.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.051
And when the others discovered
what he had done,

17:02.105 --> 17:04.812
he was banished
to the Void forever.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.232
He died there.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.611
It was a long time ago.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.106
- But why...
why did they banish him?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.779
- He became obsessed
with his research...

17:18.121 --> 17:21.238
began experimenting with forces
beyond his control.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.705
- The aether?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.040
From the Void?

17:25.170 --> 17:26.250
- Yeah.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.832
To my people,
aether is like...

17:30.967 --> 17:33.128
What's the equivalent here?
Um...

17:33.845 --> 17:35.381
Plutonium.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.641
Powerful, and,
in the right hands,

17:38.767 --> 17:39.882
can do wonderful things,

17:40.018 --> 17:44.011
but it can also destroy
everything.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.437
-Well, then...

17:47.150 --> 17:49.061
we better not
screw this up.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.695
- Great, the blind leading
the crippled.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.037
This'll be good.

18:13.385 --> 18:17.298
- So you two are cops
or used to be cops, I guess.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.555
It doesn't take a third eye
to read people.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.094
What can I do for you?

18:22.227 --> 18:25.014
- Do you recognize
either of these men?

18:25.855 --> 18:27.811
- Yeah, that's Ben Swing.

18:28.817 --> 18:29.772
That's Mike Russo.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.437
They used to be regulars

18:31.569 --> 18:35.153
before the shroud
and the explosion of Troubles.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.569
Oh, no, did something
happen to Mike?

18:38.702 --> 18:40.158
I knew it.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.619
I did a reading for him,
and I pulled the Tower card.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.908
That's usually bad news.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.158
I gave him a list of authors
with different interpretations

18:48.295 --> 18:49.785
hoping that
might cheer him up.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.422
- We found your list.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.584
The Tower card,
what number is it?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.548
- Um...

19:00.598 --> 19:03.510
In the Major Arcana, 16. See?

19:05.812 --> 19:09.350
- Struck by lightning,
long fall...

19:09.482 --> 19:10.813
just like our victim.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.191
- What card is number seven?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.938
- Number seven is the Chariot
in the Major Arcana.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.609
- Galloping hooves.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.232
That's what
our trampled guy heard.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.778
lt drove him crazy.

19:22.579 --> 19:26.197
(groaning)

19:30.045 --> 19:31.410
- Is he okay?

19:31.546 --> 19:34.879
- Your Tarot readings,
they're coming true,

19:35.008 --> 19:37.090
and they're killing people.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.674
- No, l...

19:38.803 --> 19:40.054
I'm not Troubled.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.171
- Well, you are now.

19:42.307 --> 19:47.222
Both of your customers died,
and they were both numbered... like this.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.185
- No, that's impossible.

19:49.314 --> 19:53.182
Even if what you're saying is right,
I've never drawn cards for you.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.774
I don't even know you.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.188
- Nathan, look at this.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.024
These cards...

19:59.157 --> 20:02.240
they match the numbers
under our wrists.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.405
Audrey's
and Charlotte's too.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.705
- The worst versions of these
would be

20:09.834 --> 20:11.290
andness,

20:11.961 --> 20:13.337
weakness,

20:14.714 --> 20:18.548
bad luck, and torture.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.089
(Nathan): Audrey,

20:22.472 --> 20:23.552
Charlotte,

20:24.224 --> 20:25.339
me,

20:25.809 --> 20:26.969
and you.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.761
Why are you doing this to us?

20:30.897 --> 20:34.014
- I'm not doing anything to you. I didn't
even know those cards were here.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.186
- This is your place.
How could you not know?

20:36.319 --> 20:39.106
- I would never leave cards
lying around.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.980
Look at this. This isn't like
dealing blackjack, okay?

20:42.117 --> 20:43.903
People come to me
with questions,

20:46.830 --> 20:49.116
- But they're your cards.
You did this.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.740
- Please, look, l-l know
what this looks like.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.128
But I swear to you,

20:54.254 --> 20:57.212
I don't remember anyone
asking me to do those readings,

20:57.340 --> 20:59.376
and I don't remember
drawing those cards.

21:06.349 --> 21:09.887
- If she doesn't remember
doing this, then...

21:10.019 --> 21:11.759
- She lost time.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.603
We know who can do that.
- The no-marks killer.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.724
He was here,
had her do our reading

21:17.861 --> 21:19.226
to target us.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.319
(Dwight): After she did the reading,
the fortune teller lost time.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.659
(Audrey): Okay, so we know
he's behind this Trouble,

21:27.787 --> 21:29.994
but who is
this no-marks killer,

21:30.123 --> 21:31.579
and why is he after us?

21:31.708 --> 21:35.121
- I don't know, but he's connected
to the lost colony of Roanoke.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.118
That was hundreds of years ago.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.750
Everybody there disappeared.
The only thing left

21:39.883 --> 21:41.419
was a warning carved
in a tree... "Croatoan,"

21:41.551 --> 21:42.916
whatever that means.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.179
Vince and Dave said
they saw it here too.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.592
- I'm sorry.
Did you just say "Croatoan"?

21:48.725 --> 21:50.636
- Yeah. Why? What is it?

21:50.768 --> 21:54.260
- It isn't a warning.
It's a name, a monster.

21:54.397 --> 21:55.637
(Audrey): A monster?

21:55.773 --> 21:58.981
- He is to the Void
what your Satan is to hell.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.567
aether, it's a part of him.

22:01.696 --> 22:04.062
After your father
was banished there,

22:05.241 --> 22:07.527
I think Croatoan killed him.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.410
- When we opened the door in the cave,
he must have come through.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.122
Croatoan is the no-marks killer.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.085
- Thank you...

22:19.214 --> 22:20.454
truly.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.581
You saved my life.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.092
(chuckles)
- Ah, you're too kind.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.970
- Put her there, friend.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.060
You son of a bitch.
lt's motor oil.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.055
- What the hell are you
talking about? Piss off!

22:39.192 --> 22:40.227
(groans)
- You come clean,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.396
or I'm gonna rip this thing
right off of you?

22:42.529 --> 22:43.894
(groans)
- Okay, okay.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.737
I'm just trying to make
a quick buck, all right?

22:46.866 --> 22:47.981
How did you know?

22:48.117 --> 22:50.733
- I know how I feel
around Troubled blood.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.371
Yours isn't.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.997
But you know about curses
and Troubles... How?

22:56.125 --> 22:57.831
- I got the story
from some nut job.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.748
He said a demon couple
came here 500 years ago,

23:00.880 --> 23:02.586
cursed people
with some black stuff.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.206
Spooky wise man story...
It just seemed like easy money.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.841
- Two demons
from 500 years ago,

23:10.974 --> 23:12.384
you couldn't have made
that up.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.430
I want to talk to this wise man
who told you that story.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.803
- Walter?

23:17.939 --> 23:19.304
He's up at Blue Ridge.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.600
He's always there.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.813
It's a hike.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.353
- I'm telling you, Croatoan shouldn't
have been able to leave the Void.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.276
- It doesn't matter how. He did,
and he's here, killing Troubled people

23:29.409 --> 23:30.945
and leaving a black stain
in their eyes.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.863
- Maybe that's aether.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.112
Maybe he's pulling Troubles out.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.745
- With a shroud around town,
Haven's a feeding ground.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.869
We know who he is, but how
the hell do we get rid of him?

23:44.007 --> 23:45.417
- We already have the answer...

23:45.883 --> 23:47.043
The new Barn.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.797
The way it'll work,
it'll send everything

23:49.929 --> 23:51.885
that came from the Void
back to where it belongs,

23:52.015 --> 23:54.973
including the Troubles
and Croatoan.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.759
It'll take care of them both
at the same time.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.266
- Guys, he knows.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.399
He knows who we are
and what we're doing here.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.144
That's why he's targeting us
with this Trouble.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.944
- Okay, you two need to get back
to work fast.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.943
I'll stay here, guard the tunnel
in case he comes back.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.821
- Okay.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.289
Come on, Audrey.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.750
(cell phone beeps, line trilling)

24:27.884 --> 24:29.249
(cell phone vibrating)

24:29.385 --> 24:30.670
- Dwight?
- How's it going with Lainey?

24:30.803 --> 24:33.135
- It's not. I don't know
how to solve her Trouble.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.596
I thought it was
about her estranged husband.

24:35.725 --> 24:39.559
He died, but apparently
Lainey's sister is a medium.

24:39.687 --> 24:42.554
Used her to talk to his ghost
and ﬁnd closure.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.476
I'm worried her Trouble
is always on,

24:44.609 --> 24:45.849
like yours, mine, Vickie's.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.976
- So we might not be able
to turn it off.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.773
- Dwight, with my bad luck,

24:49.906 --> 24:51.817
maybe I shouldn't be
the one doing this.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.814
- Yeah, but who else is there?

24:53.951 --> 24:56.033
(choking)

24:56.162 --> 24:57.493
- Dwight?

24:57.622 --> 24:59.362
(gasping)
Dwight?

24:59.499 --> 25:01.080
Dwight?

25:01.209 --> 25:03.416
(gasping)
- I can't...

25:04.629 --> 25:05.869
breathe.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.793
- His Tarot card is killing him.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.508
- If we can't turn off my Trouble,
what do we do?

25:13.137 --> 25:16.629
- Our readings.
They aren't finished, are they?

25:16.766 --> 25:19.803
- No, no. There's only one card
drawn for each of you.

25:19.936 --> 25:21.892
- Draw his next card.
- Are you insane?!

25:22.021 --> 25:24.057
Do you know that this
could be so much worse?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.351
- He's dying, Lainey.
Pick a card.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.454
The Devil.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.373
Oh, my God.

25:48.506 --> 25:51.373
Dwight? Dwight?

25:51.509 --> 25:52.919
Dwight!

25:56.222 --> 25:57.553
Dwight?

25:59.517 --> 26:00.848
Dwight.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.514
(Dwight): How’s it going?

26:03.646 --> 26:05.056
I’m okay. But...

26:07.275 --> 26:08.856
there's a catch.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.818
I got, uh, chained up.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.187
And they're getting tighter.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.030
- Of course. The Devil card
could mean bondage.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.027
His servants are literally
chained in the picture.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.199
- Good news is you're alive.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.538
- Bad news is,
if Croatoan comes,

26:24.667 --> 26:27.204
I can't protect Charlotte
and Audrey.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.668
- Or yourself.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.204
(Seth): Okay, well, there's Walter.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.627
- No. No, it can't be.

26:34.761 --> 26:39.095
- Maybe we're looking
for a different Walter Faraday.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.515
I don't know.

26:43.186 --> 26:45.051
What is this?

26:47.899 --> 26:51.687
It's kind of pretty in a weird,
creepy, labyrinth-y sort of way.

26:53.196 --> 26:55.152
(laughing)

26:55.281 --> 26:56.942
What?

26:57.074 --> 26:58.280
What?
What's it mean?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.195
- It means we're too late.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.820
My answers are buried
in that grave.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.947
- Come on, dude,
you don't know that.

27:06.584 --> 27:09.075
- Yeah.
Yeah, I do...

27:09.212 --> 27:12.500
because this has turned out like everything
else I've ever done in Haven.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.588
I don't know what the hell
I was expecting.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.878
(cell phone vibrating)

27:18.596 --> 27:19.676
- Hey.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.342
- It’s Charlotte.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.635
She's weak.
I can't help her like this.

27:23.768 --> 27:25.554
I can ’t see.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.223
Please, you need to figure out
a way to stop this Trouble.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.596
- We pulled another card
for Dwight,

27:29.732 --> 27:31.814
but it might have made
things worse.

27:31.943 --> 27:33.023
- Nathan, if you don ’t,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.894
I could lose her. Can you draw
new cards for us?

27:41.661 --> 27:44.949
- Draw cards for Charlotte
and Audrey too.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.116
- Please...

27:46.874 --> 27:48.114
do l have to?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.909
(sniffs)

27:56.843 --> 27:59.960
- Charlotte first.

28:09.272 --> 28:10.728
- The Lovers...

28:10.857 --> 28:15.692
this card... it represents
a-a couple coming back together,

28:15.820 --> 28:17.560
the way it was meant to be.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.779
- Must be Charlotte and Dwight.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.647
It’s ﬁnally a good card.

28:21.784 --> 28:24.025
- I can't tell if it's working.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.822
(Audrey): It’s my turn.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.659
- The Moon.

28:33.421 --> 28:37.289
lt symbolizes reality...

28:38.009 --> 28:39.874
fading into illusion.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.967
lt's... I'm sorry, this...

28:42.096 --> 28:44.803
This could mean
a lot of things.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.093
- Yeah, but what does it mean
for Audrey?

28:50.855 --> 28:52.140
- Nathan?

28:52.273 --> 28:54.013
It worked. I can see.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.645
Oh, I can see.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.187
Charlotte!

28:59.280 --> 29:00.360
Are you feeling better?

29:00.948 --> 29:03.439
- I'm okay.
- Good. I'll call you back, Nathan.

29:08.122 --> 29:09.623
He drew new cards for us,

29:09.749 --> 29:11.660
but that means that
we have to move quickly

29:11.792 --> 29:14.169
before the effects kick in,
whatever they are.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.331
Okay.
- All right.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.468
Why isn't this working?

29:30.645 --> 29:32.886
- Maybe we're going about it
the wrong way.

29:33.814 --> 29:38.558
Okay, when l controlled
those men made out of aether,

29:38.694 --> 29:41.106
it was because I was about
to lose Nathan.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.814
- We should be able to replicate
that result. lt's science.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.112
- No, it was about emotion.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.490
We need to focus
on what we're feeling,

29:51.123 --> 29:52.499
on what we want.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.957
- And why we need
to condense it down.

29:56.087 --> 29:57.952
- And what we'll lose
if we don't...

29:59.090 --> 30:00.250
This place...

30:01.258 --> 30:02.589
these people...

30:04.303 --> 30:05.839
the ones we love...

30:08.933 --> 30:10.298
each other.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.101
- Okay.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.234
- Think about that.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.197
(chuckles)
We did it.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.660
The aether core...

31:13.789 --> 31:18.032
The first piece
in the new Barn.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.576
But our Tarot cards...
What did we draw?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.958
- I drew, um, a Moon...

31:24.091 --> 31:26.377
Something about
becoming an illusion.

31:26.510 --> 31:30.753
And yours...
was the Lovers...

31:30.890 --> 31:33.222
About a couple
coming back together.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.057
I think that's a fate
that you can handle.

31:38.606 --> 31:39.766
What is it?

31:40.941 --> 31:42.317
Charlotte, what's wrong?

31:42.443 --> 31:44.855
- It's nothing.
I, um...

31:46.530 --> 31:49.146
We should go.
Come on.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.113
Dwight?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.112
- Ladies. Always a pleasure.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.501
Stop, no, no.
It's no use.

31:59.627 --> 32:02.710
It's the Tarot card.
If I struggle, it gets tighter.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.455
- I need you to take this and go.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.298
- No, we're not splitting up.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.509
We have no idea what
these new cards will do to us.

32:10.638 --> 32:13.050
That's why you need to go now
before anything else happens.

32:13.182 --> 32:16.049
Dwight's in danger.
I'm staying with him.

32:16.185 --> 32:17.846
It has to be you.

32:18.312 --> 32:21.349
Hide it...
someplace safe.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.814
Please.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.148
- Wow.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.785
You really will stay with me
when I'm old and helpless.

32:44.755 --> 32:46.256
- I wanted to...

32:47.383 --> 32:48.498
- What?

32:49.009 --> 32:50.340
What do you mean?

32:54.056 --> 32:55.171
What are you doing?

32:56.392 --> 32:59.179
Wait.
Charlotte.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.393
Charlotte,
where are you going?

33:03.190 --> 33:04.430
Wait!

33:05.317 --> 33:07.023
Charlotte, wait!

33:19.498 --> 33:21.363
- What the hell?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.175
Oh, no.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.719
My new card.
Please, not now.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.681
Not... not now.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.596
- Okay, Bert, Ernie,
I got something.

33:45.733 --> 33:48.190
But I'm a doctor,
not a magician.

33:48.319 --> 33:51.561
So I have linked the lost time
to temporary damage

33:51.697 --> 33:54.154
in the brain's hippocampus.
That's where new memories are formed.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.319
- Well, that's great.
So can we undo the damage?

33:56.452 --> 33:57.908
Get those memories back?

33:58.037 --> 33:59.868
- I'll get our witness
back in here, pronto.

33:59.997 --> 34:01.362
When she remembers Croatoan...

34:01.498 --> 34:04.456
- Guys, I wasn't able
to recover the memories.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.200
Once they're gone,
they're gone.

34:06.337 --> 34:09.295
The only thing I can do
is test if someone's lost time.

34:09.423 --> 34:12.210
- Well, Dave and I know
we've lost time before.

34:12.343 --> 34:13.708
- I've lost time too.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.425
All three of us have...

34:16.013 --> 34:17.969
in the last 24 hours.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.808
- That means Croatoan's
already been here,

34:22.937 --> 34:25.679
and we don't even
remember it.

34:25.814 --> 34:27.270
- Or we already captured him,

34:27.399 --> 34:28.935
but he just erased
our memories of it.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.150
- And how many times?

34:31.278 --> 34:33.735
(sighs)

34:33.864 --> 34:35.855
- So I'm trying to find
a place to hide this thing.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.151
Where are we
with this Trouble?

34:37.284 --> 34:38.865
- We're right where
we started.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.076
- Nathan, we have a problem.

34:46.126 --> 34:48.503
- Parker?
(grunts)

34:48.629 --> 34:50.039
Parker?

34:50.756 --> 34:52.292
Audrey?

34:52.841 --> 34:54.627
Parker, are you okay?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.921
It's the Moon card.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.770
You have to pick a new card.

35:09.358 --> 35:11.098
Pick a new card
for her now.

35:11.235 --> 35:13.772
- How can we keep doing this?
It feels like we're losing her.

35:13.904 --> 35:15.644
- We, uh...
Okay.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.363
If you can't win at the game,
then you change the game.

35:18.492 --> 35:20.028
- What?
- For your readings...

35:20.160 --> 35:23.197
someone asked you a question
to start, right?

35:23.330 --> 35:24.866
- Yeah. So?

35:24.999 --> 35:27.365
- Croatoan asked you
the question for our reading,

35:27.501 --> 35:29.162
it's killing us.

35:29.295 --> 35:33.208
So reshuffle the cards and start
a new reading for all of us.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.171
- How do you know
it will go any better?

35:35.301 --> 35:36.666
- Because I will ask
the question,

35:36.802 --> 35:38.713
and make sure there's only
one possible answer...

35:38.846 --> 35:40.131
A good one.

35:40.639 --> 35:44.348
Please. Please.
I'm losing her.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.428
- lt better be
a damn good question.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.569
It's now or never.
What will it be?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.408
- There's one thing
I know about us.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.783
We'd do anything
for this place.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.831
So...

36:15.049 --> 36:17.961
with everything we've done
for Haven over the years,

36:18.093 --> 36:20.049
what fate have we earned?

36:32.691 --> 36:34.147
Judgment.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.226
Is that bad?

36:37.363 --> 36:39.729
- Not with the question
you asked.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.648
As long as your cause is just,

36:42.785 --> 36:47.620
it means you can overcome
any obstacle.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.208
- Nathan?

37:01.345 --> 37:04.428
I don't know
what you did, but...

37:04.556 --> 37:05.841
But it worked.

37:16.777 --> 37:18.392
(cell phone beeps,
line trilling)

37:18.529 --> 37:20.645
- Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

37:21.115 --> 37:22.525
Damn it, Charlotte.

37:22.950 --> 37:25.362
(cell phone beeping,
line trilling)

37:25.494 --> 37:28.577
- Dwight?
- Audrey, are you okay?

37:28.705 --> 37:29.956
- Yeah, are you?

37:30.082 --> 37:32.073
- Charlotte... she was acting weird,
and she left.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.574
I don't know where.
- What?

37:33.710 --> 37:34.916
Well, why would she do that?

37:35.045 --> 37:37.127
- Don't know.
She gave me something.

37:39.049 --> 37:41.711
Audrey, it's her ring.

37:43.053 --> 37:44.839
She wouldn't go anywhere
without it, right?

37:44.972 --> 37:46.337
- No.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.514
But she had to leave it
with you for a reason.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.193
(creepy male voice)
- Leaving?

38:10.956 --> 38:12.241
- I thought you were dead.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.123
But when I heard
what was happening to people,

38:18.255 --> 38:20.371
it all started
to come together.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.916
- How did you know
I would come for you?

38:24.386 --> 38:26.377
- My Tarot card...

38:28.474 --> 38:29.964
the Lovers.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.723
- So you're one
of them now.

38:32.853 --> 38:34.593
- They're good people.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.597
I'm staying here with them.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.065
Why don't you come out
where I can see you?

38:40.194 --> 38:43.402
- You think
after all these years,

38:43.530 --> 38:45.236
after all that waiting,

38:45.365 --> 38:48.448
you can goad me
into a mistake?

38:49.244 --> 38:51.200
- You're not strong enough...

38:53.332 --> 38:54.412
not yet.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.953
- And you think that means
you can stop me?

38:58.504 --> 38:59.789
- I think you do.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.709
- You turned the aether
that you found into something.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.298
Give it to me.
- No, it's too late.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.837
Audrey has it.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.673
My daughter, Audrey.

39:09.806 --> 39:13.890
- Good. I've been looking forward
to meeting her.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.184
- That will never happen.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.701
- Ah, come on,
don't look so glum.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.002
- Where's Seth?

39:47.553 --> 39:48.838
Who are you?

39:49.805 --> 39:51.090
Am I hallucinating?

39:51.223 --> 39:52.633
- Sadly, no.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.389
You want answers,
don't you, Duke? Hmm?

39:58.772 --> 40:01.354
Want to know what it is
you really are.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.900
- Yeah.

40:07.197 --> 40:09.313
- Well, friend, it is
your lucky day,

40:10.200 --> 40:11.986
'cause I'm here
to tell you.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.247
- No.

40:27.384 --> 40:31.844
No, no.
No,no,no,no,no.

40:31.972 --> 40:34.258
No.
- Audrey.

40:34.391 --> 40:35.801
Oh, my girl.

40:40.856 --> 40:44.223
I am so glad
I got to know you.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.441
- Don't, don't.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.568
- I'm sorry.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.528
Just when you needed me...
(gasping)

40:50.657 --> 40:52.238
- Shh.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.985
Listen, you're gonna
be okay, all right?

40:56.371 --> 40:58.657
You brought me back
for a reason,

40:59.207 --> 41:01.198
and I'm so glad you did.

41:02.377 --> 41:05.039
- Audrey, the new Barn...

41:05.881 --> 41:08.122
it's the only way to stop him.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.420
He's furious
about what we did to Mara.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.760
- I don't understand.

41:13.889 --> 41:17.381
- I thought that Croatoan
killed my husband,

41:17.517 --> 41:18.802
but I was wrong.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.807
My husband became
the monster.

41:24.316 --> 41:27.604
Croatoan is Mara's father,

41:27.736 --> 41:29.317
your father.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.237
He has plans for you.

41:33.575 --> 41:35.941
- No. No.
(gasping)

41:36.078 --> 41:37.943
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.321
No, Charlotte, please.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.578
No, don't.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.588
No.
(sobbing)
