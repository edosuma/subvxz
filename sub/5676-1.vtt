- Oh, shredded leather.

14:32.956 --> 14:37.336
Shredded what? What you talkin' about,
man? That's a primo wallet, man.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.505
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!

So, Francis, you got the food, right?

14:53.018 --> 14:56.105

15:18.627 --> 15:22.714
Let me tell you, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.

15:22.756 --> 15:26.218
Did you have to fight, man?
Did you fight? How many were there?

I helped him get.

The money, Fagin.

Actually, I've got something
much better than money.

Some luxury items that should make
a considerable dent in my debt to you.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.252
Oh, my! You waxed your car, didn't you?

19:29.294 --> 19:32.589
