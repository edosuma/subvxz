Aslaug, this child
will never walk.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.001
By the gods, you must...

22:41.280 --> 22:42.850
You must put him out to die.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.808
Thank you for
your good advice,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.083
but I would rather
die myself than take it.

He was a great man.

We've been...
Well, I'm not done.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.841
Well, I don't know
how I can be of help.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.405
What about the priest?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.001
Athelstan?

23:57.120 --> 24:00.806
Yes, he lived with the pagans,
and pagans like sex, don't they?

like an animal.

have saved him.

In any case,
what does it matter?

27:45.880 --> 27:48.008
I'll probably die in battle.

I love you.

back to us, Floki.

the first time in this world.

Oh.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.966
You know me.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.043
I'm always cautious.
And always sensible.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.481
(BOTH LAUGHING)

28:44.640 --> 28:46.483
I would not love
you if you were sensible.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.005
I know.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.810
I'm crazy and cracked.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.922
There is something
wrong with me,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.641
which is why I choose
to travel with King Horik.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.609
Why?

29:02.840 --> 29:05.161
I don't know yet.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.364
There's something about him.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.246
He understands the gods
better than Ragnar.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.243
No.
No?

29:14.320 --> 29:15.606
That is not possible.

29:15.680 --> 29:21.323
I mean the real gods,
the darker gods,

29:21.400 --> 29:23.880
the gods that haunt me.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.681
Don't scare me, Floki.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.681
Not now.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.690
I'm sorry, Helga.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.369
I did not mean
anything by it.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.926
After all,
I'm just a joker.

29:47.800 --> 29:48.801
Rollo.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.522

if it is what you want.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.770
Thank you.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.840
TORSTEIN: What is
the matter with you?

32:36.400 --> 32:37.970
Something the seer
told me.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.690
What did the seer tell you?

32:39.840 --> 32:41.524
That Athelstan is alive.

32:44.440 --> 32:48.411
Athelstan?
But I thought he was dead.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.571
That's what King Horik
led me to believe.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.330
He also said that
Athelstan betrayed him.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.087
How is Ragnar
treating you these days?

33:09.720 --> 33:11.245
He treats me well enough.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.162
It is my judgment
that a boat builder

33:16.240 --> 33:18.481
is worth 10 earls.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.125
And how many kings?

33:20.200 --> 33:21.406
(CHUCKLES)

33:25.200 --> 33:28.204
If you decide to
build boats for me,

33:28.280 --> 33:30.806
I would certainly
treat you like a king.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.371
You think you can
buy me with riches?

33:35.440 --> 33:38.011
I would never
insult you like that.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.450
What I need from you,
Floki, are your ideas...

33:43.720 --> 33:46.200
For they are worth more
than gold and silver,

33:46.760 --> 33:49.001
and they come
from the gods.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.891
Are you sure they do?

33:52.960 --> 33:53.961
Oh, yes.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.291
Yes, lam sure.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.571
It's important for me
to understand

34:04.640 --> 34:07.291
whether your words
are a curse

34:07.920 --> 34:08.920
or a promise.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.481
Perhaps...

34:20.400 --> 34:22.083
Soon I will understand.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.288
(LAUGHING)

34:50.920 --> 34:52.409
What are you thinking?

34:53.880 --> 34:55.643
I am thinking about battle.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.762
You have nothing
to be fearful of.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.850
I will always be
by your side.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.850
You always speak so simply.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.006
Sometimes I wish my father
could do the same.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.487
Maybe our world
is a simple place.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.685
You trust the gods?

35:17.080 --> 35:18.650
I put myself in their hands.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.483
I have no will
beyond their will.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.321
And Ragnar?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.366
Ragnar is different.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.723
He does not always
submit to the gods.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.566
Challenges them.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.210
Has some awkward questions.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.049
And what is their
biggest question?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.483
Are our lives
already fated?

35:46.320 --> 35:48.846
Have the gods already
decided our destiny?

36:44.840 --> 36:47.969
A large fleet of Northmen
have come ashore in Wessex.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.724
One of the ships, lam told,

36:49.800 --> 36:52.883
was flying the black raven
banner of Ragnar Lothbrok.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.211
What will you do?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.848
I hope I can
negotiate with Ragnar.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.531
When we met before,
he struck me as different.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.250
Intelligent.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.209
He will listen to reason.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.001
Good.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.450
But if not,
I will fight him.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.807
I have already sent
a message to King Aelle,

37:26.880 --> 37:30.123
asking him to supply warriors,
according to our treaty.

37:31.120 --> 37:36.081
Whatever happens,
I will not be defeated.

a trench for it.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.006
I never imagined
the west would be so wet!

38:54.800 --> 38:56.802
Where is Torstein going?

38:57.720 --> 39:00.246
I sent him to inform
the King of our return.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.765
Why?

39:02.880 --> 39:05.281
So he knows that we
are here to talk...

39:07.080 --> 39:08.764
And not to fight.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.366
And you did that
without consulting with me.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.409
I thought you
would both agree.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.325
Why should you
think that?

39:19.120 --> 39:21.327
Because it is
a sensible policy.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.285
Fine, I will...

39:31.360 --> 39:35.081
Unfortunately, it is too late
to recall Torstein.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.685
You should have
discussed it with us.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.444
King Horik is right.

39:42.520 --> 39:47.287
I will try to remember that
the next time, Earl lngstad.

There is not going to be
a next time, Ragnar,

never ever do anything again

with me first.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.049
So, what do you propose now?

40:12.440 --> 40:13.805
Wait.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.760
For what?

40:16.640 --> 40:17.880
The unexpected.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.122
Let me tell you
what to expect, hmm?

40:20.200 --> 40:23.647
King Ecbert will send
some envoy to trick us,

40:23.840 --> 40:26.127
or he will send some
army to annihilate us.

I am prepared.

to exchange hostages.

Of course.
