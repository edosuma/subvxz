01:14.472 --> 01:21.447
<i>A thousand years ago, in the
haunted jungles of the Amazon.</i>

01:21.480 --> 01:28.353
<i>The dark shaman, Sauro,
slaughtered his entire tribe.</i>

01:28.387 --> 01:33.459
<i>Legend has it, he formed a
box from their very corpses.</i>

01:33.492 --> 01:38.463
<i>They say it's the key
to all his wicked power.</i>

01:55.213 --> 01:59.852
<i>That's Josephine...
she's insane.</i>

01:59.885 --> 02:02.822
<i>And I fucking hate her.</i>

02:06.257 --> 02:08.894
<i>The wiggling bee in the chair
is me, and I'm</i>

02:08.926 --> 02:11.930
<i>about to piss myself.</i>

02:11.963 --> 02:15.634
<i>I don't think the she-bitch
speaks English.</i>

02:18.403 --> 02:22.608
<i>If I could only remember
the word for bathroom.</i>

02:22.640 --> 02:25.677
<i>Wait, is it banjo?</i>

02:25.711 --> 02:27.246
<i>Banjo.</i>

03:09.320 --> 03:14.593
She pissed herself.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.629
I need a fucking banjo!

03:42.854 --> 03:46.359
<i>Check out these two
handsome pieces of bacon.</i>

03:46.391 --> 03:48.828
<i>They keep asking
me about the box.</i>

03:48.860 --> 03:51.296
<i>I'm covered in blood,
not my own,</i>

03:51.330 --> 03:54.267
<i>I'm smell like piss and all
they care about</i>

03:54.300 --> 03:56.535
<i>is that God damn box.</i>

03:56.568 --> 03:59.372
<i>What kind of half-assed
piggery is this?</i>

03:59.405 --> 04:01.539
You'd better snap out of it,
baby girl, you

04:01.573 --> 04:03.876
are in a world of shit.

04:03.908 --> 04:06.711
Look, I'm sure you've been
through a lot, okay?

04:06.745 --> 04:07.980
But I don't give a shit

04:08.013 --> 04:10.349
what you've been through!

04:10.382 --> 04:11.550
Okay?

04:11.582 --> 04:12.918
I don't even wanna know
why you're wearing

04:12.950 --> 04:14.819
a... a fucking bumblebee outfit!

04:14.853 --> 04:20.860
I'm a honeybee.

04:20.892 --> 04:26.331
Where the box came from,

04:26.365 --> 04:29.535
what's in the box, and more
importantly:

04:29.567 --> 04:31.570
where is the box?

04:39.545 --> 04:41.656
You'll never find it.

04:43.949 --> 04:46.035
And why is that?

04:46.884 --> 04:50.522
'Cause he's the best there is.

04:51.857 --> 04:53.526
Yeah, yeah... the thief!

04:53.559 --> 04:55.895
Mr. fuckin' rockstar!

04:57.562 --> 05:00.098
And even if you do find it,
you'll be dead

05:00.132 --> 05:04.336
before you ever know what's
inside.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.074
No offence darlin',
but we've been stuck in

05:09.108 --> 05:11.677
this shithole,
fuckin' town for almost a

05:11.709 --> 05:13.579
year.

05:13.612 --> 05:17.750
Yeah, we've seen it all.

05:19.785 --> 05:26.659
Do you have rats
in this station?

05:27.959 --> 05:31.663
Keep talkin'.

05:31.697 --> 05:33.833
Right.

05:33.865 --> 05:39.637
Do you know what the word
sombrero means?

05:39.670 --> 05:43.375
Enlighten me.

05:43.408 --> 05:46.579
It comes from the word sombra,
which means

05:46.612 --> 05:51.984
shadow.

05:52.016 --> 05:54.920
The elders of the migah
cult said that in a

05:54.952 --> 05:58.890
<i>time of great chaos
the moon would cast a</i>

05:58.923 --> 06:02.762
<i>red shadow over this town.</i>

06:02.795 --> 06:04.797
<i>And blood would
fill the streets.</i>

06:14.473 --> 06:16.475
Night's still young, assholes,
and you two

06:16.507 --> 06:18.810
pigs are so dead, I almost feel
sorry for

06:18.843 --> 06:20.879
you.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.747
So on a scale of 1 to 10,
how dead

06:22.781 --> 06:25.651
are we?

06:25.684 --> 06:31.424
Ask me again in five seconds.

06:31.456 --> 06:33.526
<i>Ooooh shit.</i>

06:39.031 --> 06:43.134
<i>Okay, maybe I should
start from the beginning.</i>

06:43.168 --> 06:46.172
<i>I hope you motherfuckers
are ready for this.</i>

07:09.597 --> 07:12.629
<b>BLOOD SOMBRERO</b>

07:13.788 --> 07:16.630
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

08:17.930 --> 08:18.930
I can do it.

08:34.580 --> 08:38.918
And who are you
supposed to be tonight?

08:38.951 --> 08:40.719
Machosaur

08:40.751 --> 08:42.053
Good.

08:42.086 --> 08:46.891
And who does Machosaur
take shit from?

08:46.924 --> 08:48.293
Nobody.

08:48.326 --> 08:49.827
That's right.

08:49.860 --> 08:54.332
And who's going
to make an entrance?

08:54.365 --> 08:56.769
Machosaur.

08:56.802 --> 09:00.806
Now, go bang down
the chamber doors.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.038
This ain't no faggot bar!

09:35.874 --> 09:37.142
I have that lipstick...

09:37.174 --> 09:39.944
God, look at this!

09:39.977 --> 09:43.348
Faggot!

09:43.381 --> 09:45.584
That's right.

10:05.037 --> 10:06.872
Hey, noodle-dick!

10:08.373 --> 10:10.376
You lost, sweetheart?

10:16.347 --> 10:22.253
I like the goatee.

10:22.287 --> 10:24.290
Pretty lipstick you got there.

10:36.134 --> 10:37.802
You walked into the wrong bar,
boy.

10:37.836 --> 10:39.738
The rebel yell.

11:22.880 --> 11:27.151
Alright, everybody just stay
calm.

11:27.184 --> 11:33.191
I'm looking for a
man named Lucifer.

11:34.926 --> 11:37.930
Lucifer is dark,

11:37.962 --> 11:43.836
about, 5'11"-ish or so.

11:46.504 --> 11:51.076
He's got a friend.

11:51.109 --> 11:56.915
He's Mexican.

12:00.351 --> 12:02.386
I promise,

12:02.419 --> 12:05.857
with just a
little bit of patience,

12:05.890 --> 12:11.163
and a dash of cooperation,

12:11.196 --> 12:15.968
no one will get hurt.

12:37.455 --> 12:41.460
Sit.

12:41.493 --> 12:43.495
Okay.

12:43.528 --> 12:44.529
Okay.

13:14.993 --> 13:16.295
Hold on a second.

13:16.327 --> 13:19.564
Tell you what sweetheart,
lemme get a...

13:19.597 --> 13:21.599
beer.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.970
Wait, there's more.

13:25.003 --> 13:26.004
There, there you go, thanks.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.223
So tell me Mr.

13:48.493 --> 13:52.231
Just call me Machosaur.

14:04.408 --> 14:09.380
Yeah.

14:09.413 --> 14:13.217
According to my intel,
a price is out there

14:13.250 --> 14:19.024
on a certain item...
of macabre significance.

14:19.057 --> 14:24.663
My partner... Saint John,
and I, seekers of

14:26.264 --> 14:30.668
the strange, procurers of rare
items that...

14:30.701 --> 14:35.474
might disturb most.

14:35.506 --> 14:38.509
<i>Over the years, we have
gathered a plethora</i>

14:38.543 --> 14:42.480
<i>of artifacts, excavated the
most haunted</i>

14:42.514 --> 14:47.385
<i>catacombs imaginable.</i>

14:47.418 --> 14:49.420
Yet, no matter how...

14:50.554 --> 14:56.460
close we think we get.

14:58.196 --> 15:00.199
So close I can taste it.

15:18.515 --> 15:23.421
Tell me, how do you expect to
find this

15:23.455 --> 15:29.394
item?

15:30.995 --> 15:36.335
Well, senor, let's just say:
I've seen her.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.408
He's full of shit.

15:43.441 --> 15:45.711
Am I?

15:45.744 --> 15:47.346
Yes.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.748
But am I really?

15:49.780 --> 15:55.721
Go on.

15:57.389 --> 16:00.658
So, I was conducting
a little business at

16:00.692 --> 16:06.597
the Arkham casino...

16:08.133 --> 16:09.501
Alright guys, alright!

16:09.533 --> 16:11.003
Take it easy!

16:11.035 --> 16:12.503
This isn't funny anymore.

16:14.038 --> 16:16.008
I get it, I get it.

16:16.041 --> 16:20.212
Take it easy guys!

16:20.245 --> 16:22.047
Alright, I get it.

16:26.250 --> 16:32.189
Ouch.

16:33.424 --> 16:38.295
So did you really think you
could take my

16:39.663 --> 16:43.201
shit and not get fucked?

16:43.234 --> 16:45.470
Well, honestly, I was kinda
hopin' I would.

16:45.503 --> 16:47.406
Hehe.

16:47.438 --> 16:49.540
Damn!

16:51.275 --> 16:55.046
Okay, let's just dial it back a
bit.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.783
It's all just a simple
communication.

16:57.816 --> 17:03.555
Hehehe.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.424
Damn, bitch!

17:06.458 --> 17:08.460
Look boys, I think he
wants to play hide

17:08.492 --> 17:09.727
and seek!

17:11.863 --> 17:13.798
God damn cunt... my fuckin nose.

17:13.832 --> 17:18.436
Crawling like a little bitch?

17:18.470 --> 17:24.142
Damn, shit.

17:29.480 --> 17:35.353
What the hell is that?

17:37.555 --> 17:43.461
Who the fuck?

18:01.913 --> 18:08.153
Let's go, bitch!

18:16.493 --> 18:22.433
Gross.

18:29.473 --> 18:30.674
Shit.

18:40.551 --> 18:43.921
So here I am, unscathed.

18:43.954 --> 18:47.893
Back for more.

18:47.925 --> 18:50.828
So what do you say?

18:50.862 --> 18:53.632
Put me in, coach?

18:53.664 --> 18:56.768
Okay, you got the job.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.403
What?

18:58.435 --> 18:59.737
What?

18:59.770 --> 19:02.773
I mean, cool.

19:02.807 --> 19:07.679
Half now, half when
the box is placed

19:07.711 --> 19:13.617
in my hand.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.533
Come on man, I got $20 on you.

19:29.567 --> 19:30.769
Dirty mother fucker.

19:30.801 --> 19:32.269
- Yeah.
- Man.

19:32.303 --> 19:33.672
Man, that's... fuck yeah.

19:33.704 --> 19:34.939
You don't fuck him up

19:34.972 --> 19:37.408
I'm gonna fuck you up.

19:38.675 --> 19:39.944
Hey watch it.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.546
-Knock him the fuck out.
-Yeah.

19:41.578 --> 19:42.780
Get him, get him, man!

19:44.682 --> 19:45.916
Kick him in the crotch.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.451
Cut off your balls, man.

19:47.484 --> 19:48.719
Yeah!

19:48.752 --> 19:50.321
Fuck him up, man!

19:50.355 --> 19:53.458
Fuck him up!

19:53.490 --> 19:54.826
Que quieres?

19:54.858 --> 20:00.231
Got a half-dead Mexican,
worth $1000.

20:00.265 --> 20:06.304
I'll take that in 20's, baby
girl.

20:07.704 --> 20:09.573
That Mexican looks all-dead to
me.

20:09.606 --> 20:12.576
Read, fucker.

20:12.609 --> 20:14.478
Cabron!

20:14.511 --> 20:15.746
Yeah fuck his ass up.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.414
Whoo! Kick his ass!

20:17.448 --> 20:22.487
You're still gonna pay my
money.

20:22.519 --> 20:23.754
What am I supposed to do

20:23.788 --> 20:26.790
with this asshole now?

20:26.824 --> 20:28.026
Get a guitar for his ass

20:28.058 --> 20:29.661
and play La Cucaracha,

20:29.693 --> 20:31.528
as far as I'm concerned.

20:31.561 --> 20:33.964
But I'm gettin' paid.

20:33.998 --> 20:40.271
No pulse, no cash.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.012
- Daaaamn!
- Man.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.614
You got knocked the fuck out.

20:49.646 --> 20:50.848
What as that man?

20:50.882 --> 20:52.350
Come on dude,

20:52.383 --> 20:53.718
what'd you knock him out for?

20:53.750 --> 20:56.054
The fuck is that?

21:00.590 --> 21:02.626
You bastard.

21:02.660 --> 21:03.894
Here's your money,

21:03.928 --> 21:07.632
get the hell out of here, man.

21:07.664 --> 21:08.666
Thanks, baby girl.

25:55.318 --> 25:56.687
This is awesome.

25:58.955 --> 26:00.924
This is awesome.

26:00.958 --> 26:03.928
I know.

26:03.961 --> 26:07.230
Why do you think he calls
himself Lucifer?

26:07.263 --> 26:12.736
Well, when ya...

26:14.105 --> 26:15.373
When you're a drug dealer,

26:15.405 --> 26:16.974
with six wives, a mansion and a
gold-plated

26:17.008 --> 26:19.309
chainsaw, you call
yourself whatever the

26:19.343 --> 26:22.113
fuck you want to.

26:22.145 --> 26:25.015
I get dibs on that
fucking chainsaw.

26:25.048 --> 26:27.018
I get dibs on the six wives.

26:28.986 --> 26:35.026
Yeah, let's move out.

26:42.732 --> 26:45.102
Okay, on three.

26:45.135 --> 26:46.370
One.

26:46.403 --> 26:47.605
Two...

27:12.930 --> 27:14.432
Shit,

27:14.464 --> 27:20.672
I think I just stepped in one
of his wives.

27:22.038 --> 27:23.407
I think I just found the rest
of her.

27:29.413 --> 27:32.416
What the...

27:32.450 --> 27:34.419
I don't even want to know.

27:34.451 --> 27:36.854
Okay, if anybody is alive, can
you please

27:36.886 --> 27:38.221
raise your hand?

27:39.723 --> 27:40.957
Anybody?

28:19.963 --> 28:21.798
Hey!

28:21.832 --> 28:23.201
We got a house full of dead
bodies and you

28:23.233 --> 28:27.204
dicks are in here clapping?

28:27.238 --> 28:28.740
You assholes should be ashamed
of

28:28.772 --> 28:30.006
yourselves...

28:31.442 --> 28:32.943
Sorry.

28:32.977 --> 28:34.178
I couldn't keep a
straight face there.

28:34.211 --> 28:35.813
Come on, let's hear it.

28:35.846 --> 28:37.013
Come on, keep clapping.

28:38.516 --> 28:39.951
Randolph, Randolph, Randolph,

28:39.983 --> 28:42.986
Randolph!

29:07.044 --> 29:10.515
This fucking guy.

29:10.548 --> 29:16.386
I like his clothes, though.

29:18.021 --> 29:21.826
It's just you and me now,
Lucy.

29:21.858 --> 29:27.330
So, what were they lookin' for?

29:27.364 --> 29:29.834
Key.

29:29.866 --> 29:33.471
To what?

29:33.503 --> 29:39.176
Everything.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.980
No one knows what's
inside the box, but...

29:43.012 --> 29:45.015
it's worth billions.

29:45.048 --> 29:48.819
Billions?

29:51.154 --> 29:54.858
I know that look.

29:54.892 --> 29:56.594
Nah, you don't know shit.

29:58.127 --> 29:59.963
I specialize in sins.

29:59.997 --> 30:02.567
As you can imagine.

30:02.599 --> 30:05.235
And greed is my fave.

30:05.269 --> 30:10.040
Just, do yourself a favor,
chief.

30:10.074 --> 30:14.245
Whatever direction that box is
in...

30:14.278 --> 30:20.317
you turn around, go the other
way.

30:21.951 --> 30:24.355
I don't see this ending well
for you.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.375
Well, we got a crime lord
across the hall

30:44.407 --> 30:45.942
and that's your cue to come
play with

30:45.976 --> 30:47.478
fucking dolls?

30:47.510 --> 30:49.480
Dude, seriously?

30:49.512 --> 30:50.947
Is he serious?

30:50.980 --> 30:52.282
Seriously, Dan?

30:52.316 --> 30:53.617
This is very high-tech shit
we're working

30:53.651 --> 30:55.486
with, here.

30:55.519 --> 30:57.320
Lots of high-profile
cases have been solved

30:57.354 --> 31:00.958
by recreating the
scene in miniature form.

31:00.990 --> 31:02.559
That does not explain
why he is over here,

31:02.593 --> 31:06.364
finger-fucking a raccoon.

31:06.396 --> 31:11.501
Well, you look like
you just blew a Smurf.

31:11.535 --> 31:14.505
Maybe I did.

31:17.374 --> 31:22.178
<i>Inside Lucifer's lair,
it's business as usual.</i>

31:22.211 --> 31:25.182
<i>You have the regular
cast of characters,</i>

31:25.214 --> 31:28.551
<i>Mexican businessman
enjoying their cervezas</i>

31:28.585 --> 31:31.221
<i>minding their own business.</i>

31:31.255 --> 31:34.025
<i>You've got the strippers
workin' the pole;</i>

31:34.057 --> 31:38.395
<i>Lucifer holding
court over his flock.</i>

31:38.429 --> 31:44.468
<i>Barth number one
is doing her thing.</i>

31:46.036 --> 31:48.405
<i>Bruno, Lucifer's
right-hand man.</i>

31:48.439 --> 31:50.141
<i>He's doin' his.</i>

31:50.173 --> 31:55.546
Alright, let's get this pussy
on the pole!

31:59.549 --> 32:01.551
<i>When suddenly,
there's a knock at the door.</i>

32:09.125 --> 32:13.530
Hey, the sword swallower's here!

32:15.065 --> 32:18.302
Pshh, pshh. No.

32:18.335 --> 32:19.036
Take this!

32:49.066 --> 32:54.505
Yeah...

33:04.213 --> 33:10.186
Do people actually
watch this shit?

33:22.165 --> 33:25.101
Yeah, come on.

33:26.369 --> 33:29.406
Don't you think we're in a
little over our

33:29.440 --> 33:35.379
head?

33:38.449 --> 33:40.518
Nope.

33:40.550 --> 33:42.352
You said yourself.

33:42.385 --> 33:48.392
She's as vicious
as a grizzly bear.

33:49.692 --> 33:50.294
Yep.

34:09.847 --> 34:11.514
So what is it exactly that
makes you

34:11.547 --> 34:15.150
different from those men.

34:15.184 --> 34:21.157
I got something they don't
have.

34:27.164 --> 34:28.699
Expecting someone?

34:28.731 --> 34:30.800
No, you?

34:30.833 --> 34:36.672
Yes, your
imaginary friend has company.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.610
<i>Shit!</i>

34:39.643 --> 34:42.579
<i>I think it's the cops.</i>

34:42.612 --> 34:44.848
<i>What should I do?</i>

34:44.882 --> 34:47.485
Yes, it's the cops!

34:47.518 --> 34:49.786
Man, we can hear
everything you're saying.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.422
You're whispering really loud.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.163
I didn't order any girl scout
cookies.

34:59.195 --> 35:03.233
Well you should, they're
fucking delicious.

35:03.266 --> 35:09.205
I'm Detective Dan Forth, this
is my partner, Randolph Carter.

35:09.239 --> 35:10.474
Dan.

35:10.507 --> 35:11.742
Ran.

35:11.775 --> 35:13.610
Nice.

35:13.643 --> 35:16.713
So what can I do for you?

35:16.746 --> 35:20.884
Who were you
talkin' to in there?

35:20.918 --> 35:23.887
That was-I was just talking.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.855
I was-you know.

35:25.889 --> 35:27.490
Snap.

35:27.523 --> 35:29.393
Now I recognize you!

35:29.425 --> 35:30.760
I was there when you sold out
Headbanger's

35:30.793 --> 35:33.230
ball back in '82!

35:33.262 --> 35:35.766
Yeah, it's the-it's the
Ravens, right?

35:35.798 --> 35:37.268
That's right.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.902
Is this one of your songs?

35:38.936 --> 35:41.305
Well actually, yeah.

35:41.338 --> 35:42.873
I can swallow a
guitar string and crap

35:42.905 --> 35:45.375
better songs than this.

35:45.409 --> 35:46.876
Ouch.

35:46.909 --> 35:48.711
We're here to talk
about Lucifer.

35:48.744 --> 35:56.554
So what makes you think
I know of a Lucifer?

36:01.824 --> 36:04.294
Ye-I dunno about that.

36:04.327 --> 36:05.563
Listen, you guys
have got about three

36:05.596 --> 36:07.398
seconds to back the
fuck up before I close

36:07.431 --> 36:09.266
this door.

36:09.298 --> 36:10.833
Three.

36:10.867 --> 36:12.469
Two.

36:12.501 --> 36:13.304
One.

36:28.985 --> 36:34.692
So, what's the plan?

36:34.724 --> 36:36.960
You really think
this is going to work?

36:36.994 --> 36:39.230
'Course it will.

36:39.262 --> 36:40.563
I'm gonna tail him,
he's gonna lead us

36:40.597 --> 36:43.234
right to the girl.

36:43.266 --> 36:46.971
Then the box is as good as ours.

36:47.003 --> 36:50.873
You mean the cult?

36:50.907 --> 36:52.710
N... Yeah.

36:52.742 --> 36:54.311
Yeah.

36:54.344 --> 36:55.612
Cult.

36:55.646 --> 36:56.847
That's what I meant.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.382
The cult.

36:58.414 --> 36:59.717
You asked how I'm gonna
catch a grizzly

36:59.750 --> 37:03.653
bear.

37:03.686 --> 37:06.289
With a big fuckin' honeybee.

37:36.987 --> 37:38.989
What'd you tell her?

37:39.021 --> 37:45.295
Tell me what I wanna know.

38:22.798 --> 38:24.067
What fool of death

38:24.101 --> 38:27.938
does Coffin wish to find?

38:27.971 --> 38:34.411
I'm lookin' for a girl.

38:41.784 --> 38:44.788
Find the box, find the girl.

38:44.820 --> 38:50.728
Where's the box?

39:00.670 --> 39:06.610
He must ask Lucifer.

39:07.978 --> 39:12.682
Yeah, I know Lucifer.

39:24.126 --> 39:28.998
One more thing Mr. Coffin.

39:29.032 --> 39:32.102
Beware the migah.

39:32.135 --> 39:34.938
Migah... the Mexican ninja.

39:36.806 --> 39:39.842
Yeah, I heard the stories.

39:39.876 --> 39:45.015
Were you called to the ancient
ones.

39:45.047 --> 39:48.951
They say he has the blood of
the elder Gods,

39:48.985 --> 39:54.557
running through his veins.

39:55.925 --> 39:57.960
In the ruins of the onyx
pyramid,

39:57.994 --> 40:00.063
young Silver Lionas

40:00.096 --> 40:03.099
forgotten, an offering to the
deep ones.

41:04.059 --> 41:07.630
One day, he returned home.

41:07.664 --> 41:13.570
Like a plague.

41:15.005 --> 41:19.610
He laid waste to his entire
village.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.599
So how do I kill him?

41:43.632 --> 41:46.736
You must remove his head,
releasing his

41:46.769 --> 41:52.643
dark, tortured soul.

41:52.675 --> 41:56.746
The box belongs to Sauro.

41:56.780 --> 42:00.150
Cucuy, yeah.

42:00.182 --> 42:03.753
Can't wait to meet him.

42:03.786 --> 42:07.156
They are the dealers of death.

42:09.793 --> 42:15.699
I am death.

42:23.072 --> 42:28.110
Thanks for comin' in, Izzy.

42:31.081 --> 42:35.919
You haven't touched your muffin.

42:35.952 --> 42:40.857
You're firing me.

42:40.889 --> 42:42.725
Not firing.

42:42.759 --> 42:45.929
Cancelling.

42:45.961 --> 42:52.102
And what's the difference
between firing and cancelling?

42:52.135 --> 42:56.205
The station doesn't
want you anymore.

42:56.239 --> 42:58.976
And cancelling, means the
station and the

42:59.009 --> 43:03.347
children don't want you anymore.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.882
Fuck you, Rico.

43:05.914 --> 43:08.384
Take it easy.

43:08.418 --> 43:09.885
It's nothin' personal.

43:09.918 --> 43:12.688
Ratings don't lie, sweetheart.

43:12.722 --> 43:14.391
Have a muffin.

43:14.423 --> 43:17.960
Fuck the ratings!

43:17.994 --> 43:22.666
And fuck your muffins.

43:22.699 --> 43:24.067
Woah.

43:24.099 --> 43:30.007
Cool your jets. Cool your jets.

43:30.039 --> 43:31.775
Calm down sweetheart

43:31.807 --> 43:33.777
Woo-sahh.

43:33.809 --> 43:35.645
Just breathe out.

43:35.679 --> 43:38.181
Let it go.

43:38.213 --> 43:40.116
It's nothin' personal.

43:40.150 --> 43:45.989
First of all, there was nothin'
I could do about it.

43:46.021 --> 43:47.896
And second,

43:50.393 --> 43:55.865
my muffins are amazing.

43:57.233 --> 44:00.737
I've given ten years
of my life to this

44:00.769 --> 44:04.875
show.

44:04.907 --> 44:10.846
Thank you.

44:18.188 --> 44:19.823
Fuck you, and your muffins,
you can both go

44:19.856 --> 44:22.359
eat a bag of dicks.

44:22.391 --> 44:23.826
And you know what?

44:23.860 --> 44:27.297
I'm keeping the suit!

44:27.329 --> 44:28.764
Fine!

44:28.797 --> 44:30.032
Keep the suit!

44:30.065 --> 44:32.134
We don't need it anyway.

44:32.168 --> 44:33.737
You know you're being replaced
by a dancing

44:33.769 --> 44:39.710
taco?

44:49.219 --> 44:53.789
I can't believe this is
happening.

44:53.822 --> 44:55.791
I can't go selling chicken
tacos again,

44:55.824 --> 44:59.096
I can't do it. I won't do it.

44:59.128 --> 45:04.467
I don't wanna go back
to sniffin' asses.

45:06.101 --> 45:07.336
You're probably gonna have to
trade in your

45:07.369 --> 45:12.208
puppy pants for a burrito or
something.

45:12.242 --> 45:14.911
Obesity at an all-time high.

45:14.943 --> 45:16.112
And they have
kids fuckin' cheerin'

45:16.146 --> 45:21.518
for a greasy fuckin' taco.

45:24.887 --> 45:27.958
Excuse me,
where can I find Rico?

45:27.990 --> 45:30.494
It's her.

45:30.527 --> 45:32.195
Shit.

45:32.228 --> 45:33.463
Get her.

45:33.496 --> 45:34.931
Kick her ass.

45:34.963 --> 45:37.768
Get off me.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.969
I'm gonna fuckin' punch you,

45:39.001 --> 45:41.371
you stupid taco.

45:41.403 --> 45:45.442
Stupid bit...

45:45.474 --> 45:48.344
Fuck you.

45:48.378 --> 45:52.082
Nobody likes a fucking fatass
fucking taco,

45:52.114 --> 45:55.851
you stupid-shit.

45:55.885 --> 45:59.356
<i>And this is where my
life would change forever.</i>

46:03.525 --> 46:06.797
Fuckin' bee bitch!

46:22.846 --> 46:24.047
I'm here to see the main man,

46:24.079 --> 46:25.447
where is he at?

46:27.916 --> 46:30.052
Great, death is all among us.

46:30.085 --> 46:31.821
What does that mean?

46:31.855 --> 46:35.891
Migah, mi...

46:35.925 --> 46:41.865
Done esta el diablo, ese?

46:45.201 --> 46:47.170
You've got a lot of nerve
comin' back after

46:47.202 --> 46:50.306
that shit you pulled, boy.

46:50.340 --> 46:51.875
I had to sweep my friend's
brains off the

46:51.907 --> 46:57.580
floor, shithead.

47:01.016 --> 47:02.585
Lucifer said to bring the box.

47:02.619 --> 47:04.086
Not a bumblebee.

47:04.119 --> 47:05.588
I'm a honeybee.

47:05.621 --> 47:07.857
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

47:07.891 --> 47:10.193
Lucifer's gone
now.

47:10.226 --> 47:11.094
Picked up by the cops.

47:11.126 --> 47:14.597
Now there's nobody
here to save your ass.

47:14.630 --> 47:15.833
Bullshit!

48:16.059 --> 48:17.060
Shit.

48:31.039 --> 48:32.574
The shit is going to hit the
fan, isn't it?

48:32.608 --> 48:36.980
I think so.

48:37.012 --> 48:38.414
About a hundred ways for you
to die in

48:38.447 --> 48:41.250
here.

48:41.284 --> 48:44.688
At least.

48:44.721 --> 48:46.722
So, who are you?

48:46.755 --> 48:48.257
Prospero.

48:48.291 --> 48:54.264
And what's Prospero going to
do?

49:03.438 --> 49:08.177
Kill everyone.

49:18.454 --> 49:21.557
That's-what-you-get!

49:21.590 --> 49:23.592
Mother-fucker!

49:56.259 --> 49:57.726
Hi.

51:04.193 --> 51:05.595
You wanna fuck with me?

51:05.628 --> 51:06.863
I got you guys.

51:06.896 --> 51:09.499
I know who you are.

51:09.532 --> 51:11.167
Are you fucking kidding?

51:11.199 --> 51:13.368
That's right it's rock and
roll.

51:13.402 --> 51:14.838
Rock and roll.

51:14.871 --> 51:16.306
Rock and roll, rock and roll,
rock and roll!

51:19.775 --> 51:22.846
Eenie.

51:22.878 --> 51:26.281
Meenie.

51:26.315 --> 51:32.188
Minie.

51:36.358 --> 51:39.862
Hello big guy.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.465
Give me the box.

52:15.498 --> 52:17.500
And no one gets hurt.

52:21.570 --> 52:25.909
Bitch!

52:25.942 --> 52:29.612
You fuckin' kidding me?

53:54.563 --> 53:56.633
What were you doing?

53:56.666 --> 53:58.701
That was a close one.

53:58.733 --> 54:01.471
Yes, it was a close call.

54:01.503 --> 54:02.804
Close call?

54:02.838 --> 54:06.843
No shit, you trigger-happy
dickhead.

54:06.876 --> 54:08.478
Now my bee suit is ruined,

54:08.510 --> 54:11.780
I have some douchebag's brains
all over me,

54:11.813 --> 54:14.349
I bruised my foot on his rib.

54:14.382 --> 54:16.418
You have got to be more
careful.

54:16.452 --> 54:22.458
Relax, I've got this under
control.

54:24.793 --> 54:26.061
Under control?

54:26.094 --> 54:27.529
That's what you call under
control?

54:27.563 --> 54:29.365
I need to see what the fuck out
of control

54:29.398 --> 54:33.536
is.

54:33.568 --> 54:38.340
Now, what do you say we just
pull over here

54:38.373 --> 54:40.009
and you can just let me out and
nobody

54:40.041 --> 54:42.411
has to know about
the 50 dead Mexicans

54:42.445 --> 54:44.981
splattered over the
floor back there.

54:45.014 --> 54:47.784
Then you should relax,
take a few deep

54:47.817 --> 54:51.820
breaths and reevaluate
the situation.

54:51.853 --> 54:53.455
Okay.

54:53.489 --> 54:54.724
Okay, you're right.

54:54.757 --> 54:56.025
Okay, alright, good.

54:56.057 --> 54:57.927
Alright, so you can just pull...
pull over

54:57.960 --> 54:59.528
right over here.

54:59.561 --> 55:01.063
Okay.

55:01.097 --> 55:06.035
Over-over-over here then.

55:06.068 --> 55:09.572
So, figure out a plan,
refocus and get your

55:09.605 --> 55:12.541
head in the game.

55:12.574 --> 55:14.443
Dude, seriously,
slow down so I can get

55:14.476 --> 55:15.711
out.

55:15.744 --> 55:17.079
Box.

55:17.112 --> 55:18.647
Find that fucking box,
and jam it straight

55:18.681 --> 55:19.882
up the devil's ass!

55:19.914 --> 55:21.750
Now, who's the man?

55:21.784 --> 55:23.052
I am!

55:23.085 --> 55:24.920
No, no you're not.

55:24.954 --> 55:26.622
You're going faster, even.

55:26.655 --> 55:28.990
I can do this.

55:29.023 --> 55:30.826
I can fucking do this.

55:30.860 --> 55:34.697
Jam it straight up his butt!

55:34.730 --> 55:35.932
What the hell are
you talking about?

55:43.438 --> 55:44.773
I need to make a phone-call.

55:50.045 --> 55:51.681
Do you happen to have a
quarter on you?

55:51.713 --> 55:53.916
You don't have a quarter?

55:53.949 --> 55:55.585
Of course I have a quarter.

55:55.617 --> 56:00.789
I just keep it under the...

56:31.487 --> 56:32.789
Rodrigo!

56:32.822 --> 56:38.628
Contessa la telefon por favor!

56:38.661 --> 56:40.163
Fuck!

56:40.195 --> 56:42.731
Where is it?

56:44.199 --> 56:45.634
Shit.

56:45.668 --> 56:46.903
Hey Ziggy,

56:46.936 --> 56:48.204
have you seen my bigger spoon?

56:48.237 --> 56:49.771
Hey, what do you say about
bringing the

56:49.804 --> 56:51.773
phone, man?!

56:51.806 --> 56:54.910
Damn.

57:02.050 --> 57:07.789
Pick up the fuckin' phone!

57:09.525 --> 57:13.528
The telephone!

57:13.561 --> 57:17.500
Fuck.

57:18.833 --> 57:20.036
Pick up the fucking phone

57:20.068 --> 57:21.603
you deaf motherfucker!

57:21.637 --> 57:22.905
Hello?

57:22.938 --> 57:24.673
- What's up, amigo?
- Thief?

57:24.706 --> 57:25.674
You got it, buddy.

57:25.708 --> 57:28.543
Is that you?

57:28.577 --> 57:29.946
Hey listen, I'm thinkin'
about getting the

57:29.978 --> 57:31.480
band back togehter,
what do you think?

57:31.514 --> 57:32.815
Ziggy!

57:32.847 --> 57:37.820
It's Theif, It sounds important.

57:45.994 --> 57:48.563
Got some bad news for you, Lucy.

57:48.597 --> 57:49.865
Your little club
looks worse than your

57:49.898 --> 57:51.534
house.

57:51.567 --> 57:52.768
Downright messy.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.103
Just awful.

57:54.135 --> 57:56.505
But, one of your your boys let
me in on a

57:56.539 --> 57:59.742
little secret.

57:59.775 --> 58:01.844
I know about the key.

58:01.876 --> 58:03.579
Pretty sneaky.

58:03.612 --> 58:05.248
And, since I know you're not
dumb enough to

58:05.280 --> 58:07.616
let it out of your sight, and I
know how you

58:07.650 --> 58:10.119
like to, butt-smuggle your
fuckin' drugs

58:10.152 --> 58:13.021
everywhere, I'm willing to bet
anything that

58:13.054 --> 58:17.025
I know where that key is.

58:17.059 --> 58:18.794
I'm sorry, I'm a little backed
up at the

58:18.827 --> 58:20.129
moment.

58:20.161 --> 58:21.730
I don't feel like going.

58:21.764 --> 58:23.599
Stage fright?

58:23.632 --> 58:25.601
I've got three words for

58:25.634 --> 58:26.869
you.

58:26.902 --> 58:28.304
Holy.

58:28.336 --> 58:29.771
Water.

58:29.804 --> 58:35.110
Enema.

58:36.344 --> 58:37.946
Yeah, the, holy water
enema was a

58:37.980 --> 58:39.148
staple of Catholic
priests back when they

58:39.181 --> 58:40.782
were doin' exorcisms.

58:40.815 --> 58:42.584
Really? That's interesting.

58:42.617 --> 58:44.920
The Bible actually says,
specifically,

58:44.954 --> 58:47.890
that holy water is not to be
ingested orally

58:47.922 --> 58:50.191
under any circumstances.

58:50.224 --> 58:53.795
So the priests got creative.

58:53.829 --> 58:57.033
Fascinating.

58:57.065 --> 59:01.736
And what better way to help
the devil

59:01.769 --> 59:07.643
himself with nervous bowels?

59:09.077 --> 59:14.182
I think you know where
this is goin'.

59:39.842 --> 59:42.010
Dammit.

59:42.043 --> 59:47.949
That was fast.

59:51.653 --> 59:53.755
You sure about this?

59:53.789 --> 59:55.091
Come on, man.

59:55.123 --> 59:56.658
Tell me you're not
at least curious.

59:56.692 --> 59:57.860
Of course I am, but...

59:59.193 --> 01:00:02.163
Hello?

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:03.833
Get the fuck out of here!

01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:09.405
I didn't finish
man, let me wipe!

01:00:16.744 --> 01:00:18.346
'Course I am.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.750
But, I'm also a cop.

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:23.786
Yeah, it's the point.

01:00:23.818 --> 01:00:25.987
What's that even
supposed to mean?

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:29.257
What it means?

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:30.760
He's in a world of chainsaws
and billion

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.128
dollar boxes.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.429
All we're doing is
getting shit all over our

01:00:33.461 --> 01:00:34.929
hands.

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:36.332
It's damn near literally!

01:00:36.364 --> 01:00:37.866
So, what now?

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.035
So, what, storm the
bad guy's hideout?

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.369
Take the box?

01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:43.005
Ride off into the sunset
holding hands?

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:44.806
Come on man, this is crazy.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.976
Nah, the mission doesn't
change.

01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:49.144
Yeah, we storm the bad guy's
hideout, kick

01:00:49.177 --> 01:00:52.147
the shit out of everybody in
there, get the

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:56.851
fuckin' box, ride off into the
sunset...

01:00:56.885 --> 01:01:00.256
and if you're lucky I'll hold
your hand.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.290
I dunno, man.

01:01:19.474 --> 01:01:20.942
Hey, remember, now
we have something that

01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:24.313
they all want.

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:25.880
What's that?

01:01:25.914 --> 01:01:27.316
Come on man, it's the key,
goddamn, pay

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:28.784
attention!

01:01:28.817 --> 01:01:31.353
No no no, listen.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.297
What is that, is that-is that
a lawnmower?

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.166
At this hour?

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:50.206
Wait a minute, that almost
sounds like a...

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:55.443
Shit! What the fuck!

01:01:55.476 --> 01:01:56.078
Shit.

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:41.356
You will never find the box!

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:47.262
Sauro will kill you...

01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:45.801
That blew right off!

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.469
Shit!

01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:53.141
Kneel before Rod, bitch.

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:00.114
It's gotta work. It's gotta
work.

01:07:00.148 --> 01:07:02.818
It's gotta work.

01:07:02.851 --> 01:07:05.487
Yeah, it's got-it's gotta do.

01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:08.056
Do you even have a plan?

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.659
Can I ask you why you took me
along on this

01:07:10.692 --> 01:07:14.663
retarded adventure?

01:07:14.695 --> 01:07:20.335
What the...

01:07:21.702 --> 01:07:23.338
Bring it on bitches.

01:07:23.371 --> 01:07:24.606
Let's go.

01:07:31.813 --> 01:07:33.382
Get some!

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:34.615
Bitch.

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:45.126
My fuckin' nose, fuck!

01:07:45.159 --> 01:07:51.165
You like it rough, dont
ya?

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:00.308
Fuck.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.611
Fuck you.

01:08:15.623 --> 01:08:19.359
I don't think so.

01:08:19.394 --> 01:08:22.863
Ka-pow!

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:27.703
Fuckin' skank.

01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:31.907
You broke that bitch.

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:38.212
Bitch... bitch.

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:30.832
Will you-will you just give
me some room

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:32.501
here?

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:33.801
There's no room.

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:35.703
Well, I can't do this, with
you next to me,

01:09:35.737 --> 01:09:37.537
alright?

01:09:37.572 --> 01:09:40.341
Man.

01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:44.377
Did you hear that?

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:46.846
Hear what?

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:47.883
I hear somebody talking.

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:40.769
Wait.

01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:42.371
Don't.

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.741
Move.

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:52.480
Don't move!

01:10:57.519 --> 01:11:03.391
Shit.

01:11:06.761 --> 01:11:09.064
Hey.

01:11:09.096 --> 01:11:13.301
What are y'all doin'?

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:16.505
You guys seen a box about ye
big?

01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:19.875
That hurt.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:20.509
Nobody?

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:07.923
Shit.

01:14:23.123 --> 01:14:24.859
Man, I'm so glad that they've
called it.

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.194
Soon we're gettin' the band
back together

01:14:26.226 --> 01:14:28.162
But all we're doin' is killin'
bitches.

01:14:28.195 --> 01:14:29.864
I wonder if I can still play
bass

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.266
I gotta dust my bass off

01:14:31.298 --> 01:14:32.868
Can you still play?

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:33.902
Rod!

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:09.538
Bitch.

01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:10.572
Cunt.

01:15:42.869 --> 01:15:46.041
Son of a bitch!

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.277
Fuck it.

01:15:50.811 --> 01:15:52.113
Fuck, get off me, bitch.

01:15:52.145 --> 01:15:57.652
Fuck.

01:15:57.685 --> 01:15:58.687
Ravens.

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:24.312
Yeah, let's go after the
box?

01:16:24.345 --> 01:16:26.914
Good fuckin' idea.

01:16:36.823 --> 01:16:42.229
Come, the devil is waiting for
you.

01:16:47.435 --> 01:16:48.971
I'm the only devil, bitch.

01:17:11.158 --> 01:17:13.728
Can't we just talk about this?

01:17:32.313 --> 01:17:37.051
This is for Rod!

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:38.086
Fuck all of y'all!

01:17:57.337 --> 01:17:58.773
Give me the guns!

01:17:58.805 --> 01:18:01.809
Give me the guns!

01:18:01.842 --> 01:18:07.481
Fuckin'... Give me the guns!

01:18:07.515 --> 01:18:09.951
You fuckin' serious?

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:16.057
Goddamn it.

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.012
Got it.

01:18:38.045 --> 01:18:40.280
Fucking got it.

01:18:40.314 --> 01:18:44.385
Fucking got it.

01:18:51.859 --> 01:18:53.461
Shit.

01:18:53.493 --> 01:18:54.496
Really?

01:19:30.965 --> 01:19:31.967
Shit.

01:21:42.563 --> 01:21:45.233
Yo.

01:21:45.265 --> 01:21:49.069
What are you doin' with my bee,
bitch?

01:21:49.103 --> 01:21:50.971
I have plans for her.

01:21:51.005 --> 01:21:54.309
Help me, goddamn it!

01:21:56.377 --> 01:21:58.012
Okay.

01:21:58.045 --> 01:22:00.681
Fair enough.

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:03.418
You piece of shit.

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:07.020
I'm a better musician than I
am a thief.

01:22:07.054 --> 01:22:09.724
Wait.

01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:11.358
What?

01:22:11.391 --> 01:22:12.693
The box.

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:15.128
It has the power to resurrect
the dead.

01:22:15.162 --> 01:22:16.731
It would be really bad if it
goes in the

01:22:16.764 --> 01:22:20.435
hands of the wrong people.

01:22:20.467 --> 01:22:22.036
What are you-tryin' to save
the world or

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:25.406
something?

01:22:25.439 --> 01:22:27.542
No.

01:22:27.574 --> 01:22:29.277
It means if you ever come
looking for that

01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:32.180
box again, I will rip your
heart through

01:22:32.212 --> 01:22:35.550
your ass, feed it to him and I
will let his

01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:41.455
zombie whores rape you.

01:22:45.426 --> 01:22:51.332
Whatever.

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:55.737
Wha-wha-wha-what the fuck?!

01:22:55.770 --> 01:23:01.709
My car!

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:04.545
I'm gonna bring every last
fucking cop we

01:23:04.578 --> 01:23:06.347
have down here and blow these
motherfuckers

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.282
a new dickhole.

01:23:08.314 --> 01:23:11.219
God!

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.620
Man, we suck at being cops.

01:23:12.653 --> 01:23:16.724
No, you suck at being cops.

01:23:16.756 --> 01:23:21.128
God, I hate you.

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:24.231
So, who are you now?

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.633
Tired.

01:23:25.666 --> 01:23:28.770
And by the way, I'm re-tired.

01:23:28.802 --> 01:23:30.805
I can't wait to see what you
get us into

01:23:30.837 --> 01:23:34.108
next.

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.777
I'm getting back on my meds.
