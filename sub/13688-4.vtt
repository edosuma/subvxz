25:48.246 --> 25:49.614
{\an8}and I--and I love him back.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.449
{\an8}Whether that means in love
is a different story,

25:51.516 --> 25:54.019
{\an8}but regardless, you know, like,
I'm starting to think

25:54.085 --> 25:56.221
{\an8}that maybe
I'm being friend-zoned,

25:56.288 --> 25:58.023
{\an8}and I hate being
in the friend zone.

25:58.089 --> 26:00.058
Maybe I am just
a [bleep] bro.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.406
- Who are exes--
Everybody--oh, wow.

26:14.472 --> 26:16.174
- Billy and I kind of had
some closure,

26:16.241 --> 26:18.543
and we're celebrating
the other one moving on,

26:18.610 --> 26:20.645

{\an8}We had no bad blood.
She's a good girl,

26:25.850 --> 26:29.454
{\an8}but I still don't think
you gonna be with her ass.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.623
- We're trying to figure
[bleep] out.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.225
That's why we both don't think,
like, we should leave.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.493
{\an1}- You guys are still
flirting.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.861
- There's a lot more
than just flirting.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.364
{\an3}- No, honestly,
I don't think either one of us

26:39.431 --> 26:41.299
{\an3}regret those actions.
We're gonna try to move...

26:41.366 --> 26:42.567
- I do.
- Past that.

26:42.634 --> 26:45.003
You re--you regret that?
- Yeah.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.705
{\an3}- Oh,
I didn't know that.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.340
{\an8}- I thought me
and Anthony were bad.

26:48.406 --> 26:49.908
{\an8}Shannon and Anthony
are ten times worse.

<i>hooking up with her,</i>

you regretted that.

27:11.429 --> 27:15.333
{\an3}The more I'm around you,
the more I realize, like...

27:15.400 --> 27:19.437
{\an3}maybe I don't want to stop
fighting for us.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.306
<i>It's just not fair.</i>

{\an8}Like, just tell me what it is
and tell me what it isn't.

27:31.049 --> 27:32.884
{\an1}- I just think we should
have had, like,

27:32.951 --> 27:35.920
{\an1}this conversation before
Madison happened, you know?

27:37.455 --> 27:40.692
<i>- I came in here with</i>
<i>the intention of revenge,</i>

27:40.759 --> 27:42.861
<i>and I realized</i>
<i>that I still care.</i>

27:42.927 --> 27:46.197
{\an8}I'm, like, so scared
to get hurt again,

27:47.932 --> 27:50.902
{\an8}And I just have
so much love for him.

27:50.969 --> 27:55.140
{\an8}I just think there's a lot
of--a lot of cracked doors.

27:55.206 --> 27:58.977

when you want to get away,

doesn't stop fighting.

28:01.246 --> 28:04.549

<i>'cause elimination's</i>
<i>right around the corner.</i>

28:07.752 --> 28:09.354

28:11.556 --> 28:13.191

if she wants to find something
while she's here, that's great,

28:15.760 --> 28:18.596
but, like, her being here isn't
changing anything for me, so...

28:18.663 --> 28:20.432
{\an1}- It's really just being in
the way of you finding a next.

28:20.498 --> 28:24.903

Devin, Cameron, and Kenya.

28:30.508 --> 28:31.976
{\an8}Obviously we're not gonna vote
for Anthony.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.445
He's one of the guys now.
We're very cool with him.

28:33.511 --> 28:34.779
- You guys need to make sure
you're on the same page

28:34.846 --> 28:36.181
unless you guys
talked to the girls.

28:36.247 --> 28:37.749
- We decide what goes on
if we all vote the same way.

28:37.816 --> 28:38.983
- Exactly.
- Anthony's safe.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.186
- Yeah, and Marie's
safe for me.

28:41.252 --> 28:43.655
- Yeah. Comes down to Alexis
and Shannon and Cara.

28:43.721 --> 28:45.824
- It seems like Shannon and him
have decided to rekindle.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.158
- Well, if you ask me
to keep her

28:47.225 --> 28:48.827
and not cut her,
I'll respect that.

28:48.893 --> 28:49.994
- For me, it's like, if--
let's say

28:50.061 --> 28:51.830
she does get cut, right,
and sent home.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.065
I won't be upset.
Shannon's like,

28:54.132 --> 28:56.901
{\an8}"Okay, we're a thing now
just because we hooked up,"

28:56.968 --> 28:59.104
{\an8}and in our past that's
exactly what would happen.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.239
{\an8}I'm trying to break that cycle.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.541
- I think Geles is gonna
expect me to vote for Alexis.

29:03.608 --> 29:04.909
- Yeah, you gotta ask yourself

29:04.976 --> 29:06.344
who's getting in the way
of your ex the most

29:06.411 --> 29:08.012

could be given

for a few different reasons.
It could be for your ex

30:23.454 --> 30:25.523
that you finally got
some closure with,

30:25.590 --> 30:27.292
or you could use it
to send an ex home

'cause you're just sick
of seeing their face.

As y'all know, Kenya's sick,

30:54.352 --> 30:55.553
so she had
to get out of the house.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.989
Now, she was able to place
a cut vote,

30:58.056 --> 31:00.558
which will count
for tonight's ceremony.

Does it bother you
that she hooked up

31:46.437 --> 31:47.939

the ability
to sit down and talk.

a little too much for somebody.

that one-on-one talk

telling each other, like,

33:49.594 --> 33:51.129

just isn't there anymore?

{\an3}- Oh, so much happiness,
it's insane.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.764
They're
all [bleep] best friends.

34:27.831 --> 34:29.167
- Yeah.
- It's so weird. It's crazy.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.268
- They're best friends.
- They're a threple.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.570
- It's a threple.

34:32.637 --> 34:35.940
- Anthony, what about you
and Shannon?

34:36.007 --> 34:37.875
I heard y'all had
some fun last night,

34:37.942 --> 34:40.011
or should I say
this morning...

34:40.077 --> 34:41.712
or both?
- Little bit of both,

34:41.779 --> 34:43.347
little of both.
- It's not like there's cameras

34:43.414 --> 34:44.649
in the house.
- I forgot.

34:44.715 --> 34:46.717
- Yeah,
I forgot for a second.

34:46.784 --> 34:50.353
- What's going on?
Y'all rekindling things?

34:51.255 --> 34:54.859
- I think there's a lot that
we still haven't talked about.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.527
Even though we hooked up,
I want to put that to the side

34:56.594 --> 34:58.496
and have, like,
that real conversation

34:58.563 --> 35:00.231
to give her that,
like, closure.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.800
- But what I'm saying,
it's a lot of physical there,

35:02.867 --> 35:04.902
but y'all still
haven't really communicated.

35:04.969 --> 35:06.304
- Exactly.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.005
- And that's where y'all always
crash and burn.

35:08.072 --> 35:09.907
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you think, Shannon?

35:09.974 --> 35:11.242
- I have a lot of questions.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.945
I also have a lot of feelings
for this guy,

35:14.011 --> 35:16.447
and he knows that,
and I came in here

35:16.514 --> 35:18.683
with so many
different intentions,

35:18.749 --> 35:20.418
and the more I spend here,

35:20.485 --> 35:21.986
the more I'm starting
to realize

35:22.053 --> 35:25.289
maybe I--I do want
to keep fighting for him.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.592
- It's a journey.
- It's a [bleep]-up journey.

35:27.658 --> 35:30.094
- 'Cause...

35:30.161 --> 35:32.196
like,
I'm so in love with him,

35:32.263 --> 35:37.235
and I can't fight
the feeling anymore,

35:37.301 --> 35:40.304
and I have to be honest with
myself as much as possible.

35:40.371 --> 35:44.308
- Geles, so I know you and Cam
have a thing going on.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.877
How you feel about all that?

35:45.943 --> 35:47.945
- Cameron definitely, like,
painted this beautiful picture

35:48.012 --> 35:49.814
for me
for when his ex got here,

35:49.881 --> 35:52.450
how he was gonna
move me out to L.A.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.118
and we were gonna be together.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.621
There was no way
he would pick his ex over me,

35:56.687 --> 35:58.990
and I'm just not interested
in someone

35:59.056 --> 36:01.025
that wants to pursue
his ex-girlfriend

36:01.092 --> 36:04.795
and then still kind of
flirt with me on the side.

36:04.862 --> 36:06.130
I just--I want to be loved,

36:06.197 --> 36:08.466
{\an1}and I want to be someone's
first choice, and--

36:08.533 --> 36:11.202
- You ready to find your next.
- Yeah, my time's gonna come.

36:11.269 --> 36:12.603
- Okay.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.905
- My time's gonna come,
and it's gonna be okay.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.941
- All right.
Y'all can take a seat.

36:17.008 --> 36:21.479
Last but not least,
Cameron, Alexis,

36:21.546 --> 36:23.281
step up to the pineapple.

36:28.219 --> 36:31.389
Cameron, do you have
feelings for Alexis?

36:31.455 --> 36:34.458
- This is what I've been
waiting for right here.

Of course, yeah.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.647
{\an1}It would be...
ludicrous to say I didn't.

36:56.714 --> 37:00.117

37:03.621 --> 37:05.323
It's not unique.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.426
- I feel like a complete
piece of [bleep].

37:08.492 --> 37:10.628
I did tell Geles
a lot of things,

37:10.695 --> 37:13.331
but I had
real feelings for Geles.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.299
I came into this house single.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.134
I didn't know what she was
gonna be doing back home.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.436
I didn't know
what her plans were.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.838
{\an1}We were broken up,
and I started feeling

37:20.905 --> 37:23.341
{\an1}a whole different girl
in a whole different life.

37:23.407 --> 37:26.711
{\an1}I said a ton of [bleep],
and I didn't know

37:26.777 --> 37:29.146
{\an1}how to explain it to her
when I saw her.

37:29.213 --> 37:30.982
{\an1}All of my feelings for her
started coming back,

37:31.048 --> 37:32.316
{\an1}so I'm--it's
a tough-ass situation

37:32.383 --> 37:34.518
to--to be caught in.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.253
- Complicated?
- Yeah, for sure.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.591
- Any last words?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.593
- I know.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.128

37:44.195 --> 37:45.396
{\an1}there's no other way
I can say that.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.431
- She deserves way
better than this.

37:47.498 --> 37:48.933
- No, "I love him,
and I want to be with him."

37:49.000 --> 37:50.234
- No, she doesn't deserve this.

37:50.301 --> 37:52.136
{\an3}- But she's going back
with him.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.738
<i>- I would have</i>
<i>told you that.</i>

37:53.804 --> 37:56.841
{\an1}I swear to God
I would have told you that.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.243
- Alexis, have your feelings
for Cameron changed

37:59.310 --> 38:01.245
since you've arrived here?

38:01.312 --> 38:04.181
- No.
We're family at this point.

38:04.248 --> 38:05.783
- We're family?
It's crazy.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.618
I just [bleep] another bitch
and said I love her,

38:07.685 --> 38:09.520
but we're family.
- He's [bleep] crying.

38:09.587 --> 38:10.621
- Huh?
- He's crying.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.156
- No, no, this is real [bleep].

38:12.223 --> 38:14.225
They have real history.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.693
- All right, so Alexis.
- Yeah?

38:15.760 --> 38:18.429
- You came in the house.
You were there for five seconds

38:18.496 --> 38:23.134
and then straight down
to the Shack of Secrets.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.337
- Yeah.
- How was that?

38:26.404 --> 38:29.473
- It was a lot.
- Yeah.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.176
- It's fine.
Just thinking about it.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.413
No human
wants to see that, nobody.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.014
I c--I couldn't name one.

38:37.081 --> 38:40.051
If it didn't bother someone,
it would be weird.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.786
Yeah.

38:41.852 --> 38:43.387
- I can see y'all been
through a lot.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.489
You have a lot of things
to figure out.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.759
This is a journey,
but it's your journey.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.327
- I'm just sick of talking
about

38:50.394 --> 38:52.496
other people's relationship
instead of ours,

38:52.563 --> 38:55.599
'cause we've done that
our whole relationship.

38:57.935 --> 38:59.870
- Let's give it a shot.
Let's see what happens.

38:59.937 --> 39:02.239
- All right.
Y'all can take a seat.

39:03.808 --> 39:07.945
All right, it's time to see
whether Alexis, Cara, Anthony,

39:08.012 --> 39:11.882
Shannon, Marie,
or Tevin is going home.

39:21.992 --> 39:23.861
First vote.

39:23.928 --> 39:26.230
- Anthony wants Shannon to go,
and I don't like

39:26.297 --> 39:29.400
{\an8}how they go back and forth,
so I support my man Anthony,

39:29.467 --> 39:31.168
{\an8}and he needs to get away
from Shannon,

39:31.235 --> 39:32.803
{\an8}so I hope they get rid
of her this week.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.474
- Alexis.
- What? Whoa.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.575

this [bleep] TV.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.273

before everyone else does.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.741
- Yeah, let's get the tequila
before everyone else does.
