00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:11.010 --> 00:14.447
...a bit. Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr,
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.447 --> 00:17.584
the show that brings you
genuine stories from history...

00:17.584 --> 00:19.886
Go suck a... seal cock.

00:19.886 --> 00:23.757
...as told by blind drunk comedians.
I probably need another beer.

00:23.757 --> 00:27.894
Out storytellers like their history
shaken and slurred. Oh, fuck.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.230
(angelic humming)

00:30.230 --> 00:33.066
Iceberger?
Let's just chop it in half.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.567
Why are you being racist?!

00:34.567 --> 00:36.536
He's just ran circles round us.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.672
She's WhatsApping her mates,
"Edward's a ****."

00:39.672 --> 00:42.475
Can I say ****? Can I?

00:54.287 --> 00:57.390
We'll begin with the tale
of Scott of the Antarctic.

00:57.390 --> 01:01.227
No story has involved this much
alcohol, tents and cold shoulders

01:01.227 --> 01:05.197
since I tried to sneak into Cara
Delevingne's tipi last Glastonbury.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.200
Iain Stirling is telling this one,

01:07.200 --> 01:10.770
after two pints of lager
and nine double whisky and Cokes.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.806
(laughs)

01:12.806 --> 01:18.077
Right, I'm talking about
Robert Falcon Scott,

01:18.077 --> 01:21.347
AKA Scott of the Antarctic.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.852
(belches, laughs) Excuse me.

01:26.719 --> 01:30.790
1911, Robert's kicking about.
He used to be in the Navy.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.393
He's been everywhere.
Literally everywhere.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.228
You name it, he's been there.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.931
He's like, "I'm done
with this 18-to-30 shit."

01:37.931 --> 01:40.133
"I'm gonna go to the South Pole,
mate."

01:40.133 --> 01:43.837
"We want to do research and
find out what's going on down there."

01:43.837 --> 01:47.607
So it's all about the research.
But in his head he's thinking,

01:47.607 --> 01:50.944
"I, Robert Falcon Scott,
middle name Falcon,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.948
write it down, F-A-L-C-O-N,

01:54.948 --> 01:58.518
I'm gonna be the first one
to the South Pole, mate."

01:59.352 --> 02:02.922
So he's off. He's gone.

02:02.922 --> 02:06.926
To... To the place.
To the South Pole.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.763
4th January, 1911,

02:10.763 --> 02:14.000
Scott and the lads
arrive in Antarctica.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.070
You've got Lawrence Oates,
Captain Lawrence Oates,

02:17.070 --> 02:21.107
and he's saying things like,
I dislike Scott intensely."

02:21.107 --> 02:24.544
"Scott doesn't know what he's doing,
he's reckless."

02:24.544 --> 02:28.882
"I should be in charge of this
whole affair, sort of thing."

02:28.882 --> 02:32.185
You've got Edward Miller,
Mr Scientist. Wilson.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.053
Oh, piss!

02:34.053 --> 02:36.256
Edward Wilson.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.526
He's over there, just constantly
on the phone to his missus.

02:39.526 --> 02:42.562
Like, "I'll be home soon, babes."

02:42.562 --> 02:44.430
"BRB."

02:44.430 --> 02:46.833
"What time
are you gonna be home for tea?"

02:46.833 --> 02:50.770
He's like, "In about seven months.
It's a nightmare!"

02:50.770 --> 02:53.573
You've got Henry Bowers
who was an explorer.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.074
The han...

02:55.074 --> 02:58.845
I just threw up in my mouth
a little bit then. It's fine.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.947
Then... bang!

03:00.947 --> 03:03.650
(mimics telegram beeps)

03:03.650 --> 03:06.486
"Telegram
for Scott of the Antarctic."

03:06.486 --> 03:09.355
Scott's like,
"You won't believe who it is."

03:09.355 --> 03:11.925
"Fucking Roald Amundsen."

03:13.092 --> 03:16.396
Norwegian boy,
tall, blonde, handsome.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.932
He's tanned,
even though Norway is cold.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.167
That's how handsome this man is.

03:22.168 --> 03:26.039
If Hitler had won, Roald Amundsen
is what would have happened.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.975
(laughs)

03:28.975 --> 03:30.443
But you get this idea.

03:30.443 --> 03:33.846
This guy is Aryan as shit,
is what I'm trying to say to you.

03:33.846 --> 03:38.952
He says, "Hey, Scott,
we was gonna go to the North Pole,

03:38.952 --> 03:41.721
but Americans
have gone to the North Pole."

03:41.721 --> 03:44.557
"No point now, I'm going South Pole."

03:44.557 --> 03:46.993
"Go suck a... seal cock."

03:48.127 --> 03:51.864
"We're gonna beat you there, mate,
and you're done for."

03:51.864 --> 03:55.168
And then Scott is like,
"Wow, that guy is good at English."

03:55.168 --> 03:56.669
That's his first thought.

03:56.669 --> 04:02.375
Second thought is like, "Boys,
we're up against a very big man."

04:03.276 --> 04:06.279
So they were like,
"We better get headed off, like."

04:06.279 --> 04:08.414
Captain Lawrence Oates goes,

04:08.414 --> 04:13.920
"How the fuck
are we getting to the South Pole?"

04:13.920 --> 04:18.625
And Scott's all like,
"We'll ski it. Everyone can ski."

04:18.625 --> 04:21.361
And Lawrence was like,
"Erm, nobody can ski."

04:21.361 --> 04:23.830
Scott was like,
"What, no one can ski?"

04:23.830 --> 04:25.565
"Nah, no one can ski, man."

04:25.565 --> 04:28.067
Scott was like,
"We need to change this up."

04:28.067 --> 04:31.871
They were like, "Brilliant,
what's your idea?" "Roller-skates."

04:31.871 --> 04:34.874
(man laughs)
Maybe we'll get some roller-skates.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.276
Sorry. Sorry!

04:37.276 --> 04:39.545
He was like,
"We're gonna have to walk it."

04:43.950 --> 04:45.785
(laughs)

04:48.655 --> 04:52.125
So they're walking down.
It's freezing cold, man.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.795
So then, Scott of the Antarctic is
like, "Do you know what, lads?"

04:55.795 --> 04:58.931
"This is going terribly.
We're gonna go for a detour."

04:58.931 --> 05:01.968
Lawrence is like,
"Please say you know a shortcut."

05:01.968 --> 05:05.371
"Do you know a shortcut?"
"It's not exactly a shortcut."

05:05.371 --> 05:09.509
"What I want you to do
is walk and get some penguin eggs."

05:10.443 --> 05:12.345
"I need me some penguin eggs."

05:12.345 --> 05:15.648
"How far, mate?"
"It's like a hundred kilometres."

05:15.648 --> 05:20.353
Lawrence is like, "This is bullshit!
This is absolute bloody bullshit!"

05:20.353 --> 05:22.955
So they have to walk off
to get penguin eggs.

05:22.955 --> 05:25.191
They were going to get
the penguin eggs

05:25.191 --> 05:28.895
because they thought they'd find out
more about South Pole life,

05:28.895 --> 05:31.064
more about penguins.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.834
And everyone's like, "Is this
penguin egg worth the expedition?"

05:34.834 --> 05:39.405
And Edward Miller was like,
"Yeah, like, of course they are."

05:39.405 --> 05:43.209
In his head he's like,
"We're all gonna die."

05:43.209 --> 05:45.745
They get these eggs back,
Lawrence has got two.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.647
He's holding them over his boobs.

05:47.647 --> 05:50.917
He's like, "Oh, I look like a tit
and I feel like a tit."

05:50.917 --> 05:54.087
He's furious, right?
Turns out, no use.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.923
No one learns anything more
about penguins.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.292
Like, "Oh, mate,
we are so far behind."

06:06.032 --> 06:07.934
Here's where it gets better.

06:07.934 --> 06:13.973
So, on 17th January, 1912,
they see the South Pole.

06:13.973 --> 06:17.744
Scott of the Antarctic is like...
(angelic humming)

06:17.744 --> 06:21.280
"That's a bit weird." He goes,
"Shut up, I'm setting the scene."

06:21.280 --> 06:24.484
There's still the guys
carrying the penguin eggs going,

06:24.484 --> 06:26.486
"These are obviously dead now."

06:26.486 --> 06:28.988
They walk up, what do they see?

06:28.988 --> 06:33.760
Red, white, cross, bosh!

06:33.760 --> 06:37.630
They can hear fucking
Captain Norwegian in the background.

06:37.630 --> 06:41.434
"Norgei! Norgei! Norgei!"

06:41.434 --> 06:42.969
"Ah, fuck thy."

06:42.969 --> 06:45.071
"Fuck thy."

06:45.071 --> 06:48.107
Norway have been there first.
Days before.

06:48.107 --> 06:52.645
26, 36, 46, 51.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.715
(man) 34.
34 days in advance.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.985
Scott's like,
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

06:58.985 --> 07:02.722
Oates is like, "I fucking saw that.
I bloody saw that coming."

07:04.991 --> 07:07.426
Scott's like, "This is a nightmare."

07:07.426 --> 07:09.595
"Not only
have we not got there first,

07:09.595 --> 07:12.131
we've got 1,500 kilometres
back home."

07:13.466 --> 07:16.435
They're going,
"We're just heading home, yeah?"

07:16.435 --> 07:20.573
Scott's like, "Nah, man,
we're making this journey count."

07:20.573 --> 07:22.408
Then Scott goes out loud,

07:22.408 --> 07:28.114
"We're all gonna go
get 36lbs of rocks, mate,

07:28.114 --> 07:30.683
and we're carrying them
all the way back."

07:30.683 --> 07:33.686
Everyone's going,
"We've got stones in England."

07:33.686 --> 07:37.990
He's like, "No, these are South Pole
stones. Stones are important."

07:37.990 --> 07:41.427
So then the poor Edward lad,
he texts his missus going,

07:41.427 --> 07:45.731
"Make that eight months.
I've got to get some stones."

07:45.731 --> 07:48.267
His missus is doing
the whole thing of like,

07:48.267 --> 07:52.371
"Every time you go out, you give it
the whole extra-month stones thing."

07:52.371 --> 07:55.708
"Nah, this is legit this time.
I need to get me some stones."

07:55.708 --> 07:57.877
So, they go and get some stones.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.915
Oh, fuck.

08:08.054 --> 08:12.325
March 16th, 1912,
it's been a long journey.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.728
They're cold, they're hungry.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.198
They get close,
they know they're close.

08:19.198 --> 08:22.068
They're like 11 kilometres away,
that's it. Easy.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.871
But it's a blizzard, mate.
It's a nightmare.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.908
They pitch up, they're in their tent.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.410
Morale is at an all-time low.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.113
They all hate Captain Scott, mate.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.315
Ed was on the phone
to the missus again.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.085
"I'm in a tent."
"Are there any women there?"

08:39.085 --> 08:41.153
"It's just a load of men."

08:42.722 --> 08:46.792
Lawrence Oates is there and
he looks at his toes and he's like,

08:46.792 --> 08:49.228
"Shit. I haven't got any."

08:50.863 --> 08:52.465
"That's bad."

08:55.568 --> 09:00.873
So he goes,
"Boys, I'm holding everyone back."

09:00.873 --> 09:04.410
"I may be gone for some time."

09:05.478 --> 09:07.346
Which he must have hated,

09:07.346 --> 09:11.684
cos in his head he's thinking,
"Penguin eggs and rocks?!"

09:11.684 --> 09:14.787
"I've got no toes, mate!"

09:14.787 --> 09:17.156
That's what he's thinking.

09:17.156 --> 09:20.960
But he's British, isn't he?
And he walks out that tent.

09:29.635 --> 09:32.705
And that's him. That's him knackered!

09:32.705 --> 09:34.173
Gone!

09:34.173 --> 09:37.109
Edward's fucking missus
is furious at this point.

09:37.109 --> 09:41.647
She's WhatsApping her mates, they've
got a group now. "Edward's a cunt!"

09:41.647 --> 09:45.284
Can you say that... Can I say cunt?

09:45.284 --> 09:48.287
Can I? (laughs)

09:48.287 --> 09:50.990
They've got their group,
"Edward's a cunt."

09:50.990 --> 09:53.426
They're going,
"Edward's not been home."

09:53.426 --> 09:57.196
"What's he been doing?" "He's been
getting 36 kilograms of rock."

09:57.196 --> 10:01.233
All these wives are going, "I think
that might be a lie, you know."

10:01.233 --> 10:03.736
Scott of the Antarctic
is looking at the bag

10:03.736 --> 10:06.038
full of 36 kilograms of stones going,

10:06.038 --> 10:09.575
"Do you know what?
If the truth be told,

10:09.575 --> 10:12.511
I think I've dropped the ball
in this whole thing."

10:12.511 --> 10:15.281
"Maybe we shouldn't
have picked up the stones."

10:15.281 --> 10:19.151
So you're thinking, what do you do?
Do you just walk it?

10:19.151 --> 10:21.320
What does he do?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.456
What does he do? What does he do?

10:23.456 --> 10:27.126
He fucking waits... to die!

10:27.126 --> 10:28.561
That's it!

10:28.561 --> 10:30.496
Cooks a cup of tea.

10:30.496 --> 10:34.200
So he's got heat. Cook the eggs!

10:34.200 --> 10:37.837
Dinner is served.
But no, he's too good for that.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.906
"Oh, at this point,
I'll just have a tea and die."

10:41.874 --> 10:43.642
Get outta town.

10:44.810 --> 10:50.649
So these maniacs have a cup of tea,
and then sit there and die.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.786
Boff! Dead.

10:57.790 --> 11:01.961
And then it turns out once
they'd died that the rocks they got

11:01.961 --> 11:05.464
meant that, like,
it turned out that at one point,

11:05.464 --> 11:10.970
the world was like
one whole beautiful... planet.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.105
(man) Continent.
Continent.

11:13.105 --> 11:14.673
Imagine that.

11:14.673 --> 11:19.111
But at the same time, eat the egg!

11:19.111 --> 11:21.514
You should have ate it and survived,

11:21.514 --> 11:24.850
and walked 11 kilometres
and got home.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.592
(applause)

11:33.592 --> 11:36.829
Funnily enough, Iain echoed
Captain Oates' final words,

11:36.829 --> 11:38.197
"I may be some time,"

11:38.197 --> 11:41.567
after we finished filming
and he went into the bathroom.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.436
Time for us to take a quick break.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.439
Next up, we've got Phill Jupitus
sinking the Titanic.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.207
"Iceberg!"
(honks)

11:48.207 --> 11:50.743
"Let's just chop it in half."
Good God.

11:53.012 --> 11:53.212
.

11:55.714 --> 11:55.915
.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.951
Welcome back to Drunk History,

11:58.951 --> 12:01.887
the show that mixes up
a delicious cocktail

12:01.887 --> 12:05.491
of true historical stories and
shit-faced comedians. "Fuck thy."

12:06.625 --> 12:09.361
Next we have the tragic story
of the Titanic.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.465
The biggest tragedy of Titanic
was that there weren't

12:12.465 --> 12:15.568
more close-up shots
of Kate Winslet's... (ship horn)

12:15.568 --> 12:19.004
By the end of this, Chris Ramsey
had struck 16 bottles of lager,

12:19.004 --> 12:23.209
making him officially
Newcastle's most sober citizen.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.044
Hello.

12:25.044 --> 12:29.115
I'm gonna tell you the story
of the Titanic.

12:29.115 --> 12:33.285
The greatest ship whoever was,
that sunk sadly.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.056
Iceberg, dead ahead!

12:40.559 --> 12:43.195
So, it's 1908,

12:43.195 --> 12:47.800
and a ship designer, Thomas Andrews,
has got an idea for a new ship.

12:47.800 --> 12:53.405
Thomas Andrews goes to the guys
at White Silver Star Liners,

12:53.405 --> 12:57.109
and he said, "I've drew a picture

12:57.109 --> 13:01.347
of the best ship
you've ever fucking seen."

13:01.347 --> 13:04.683
"This is ridiculous, but look at it."

13:04.683 --> 13:08.854
He was a really good drawer. In the
corner, he'd drew a spunking knob.

13:08.854 --> 13:10.723
"Sorry," and he ripped them off.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.025
And he goes,
"All right, er, Titanic."

13:13.025 --> 13:16.962
"Biggest, most luxurious, fantastic
ship we've ever built, but..."

13:16.962 --> 13:20.266
"What's wrong with ships?
You name me the main problem."

13:20.266 --> 13:21.834
"Yes, they sink."

13:21.834 --> 13:24.270
"Guess what, guys? This one..."

13:24.270 --> 13:27.173
"Nah, doesn't sink, mate."

13:27.173 --> 13:31.544
Bruce Ismay, the managing director
of the shipping company,

13:31.544 --> 13:34.914
is just like,
"Shit, that's some impressive stuff."

13:34.914 --> 13:38.284
"I think in four years' time,
we'll have that built."

13:38.284 --> 13:40.319
And that was it, one meeting.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.323
1912, boom, ship built.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.626
Now we need a captain for this ship.

13:47.626 --> 13:51.864
So they find this guy,
Edward John Smith.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.999
He was remarkably Captain Birdseye.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.569
Like, crazily Captain Birdseye.
Google him.

13:56.569 --> 14:01.073
He's evidently crashed a ship before.

14:01.073 --> 14:04.243
Edward John Smith
has gone in for a job interview.

14:04.243 --> 14:05.878
He can't believe his luck.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.747
I imagine it was something like,
"Edward, thanks."

14:08.747 --> 14:11.884
"Just before we start, have you...
It's off the record."

14:11.884 --> 14:15.354
"Have you ever...
Have you ever crashed a ship?"

14:15.354 --> 14:21.393
And he's just like, "When people
ask us if I've ever crashed a boat,

14:21.393 --> 14:24.163
I go, 'No.'"

14:24.163 --> 14:26.365
"No, I've never crashed a boat."

14:27.466 --> 14:31.036
"Well, I've never crashed a boat
that's worth talking about."

14:31.036 --> 14:33.439
"No, I've never been
near a crashed boat."

14:33.439 --> 14:35.841
"What's a crashed boat?
It wasn't even me."

14:35.841 --> 14:38.110
"Why are you being racist?"

14:38.110 --> 14:40.746
He was the first white man
to use the race card.

14:40.746 --> 14:44.083
And they went, "Ah,
he's just ran circles around us."

14:44.083 --> 14:47.286
And he still got the job.
It was ridiculous.

14:47.286 --> 14:52.691
So, big day comes.
This is 10th April, 19... 12?

14:52.691 --> 14:53.926
(chuckles)

14:53.926 --> 14:56.362
They're setting off
on the maiden voyage.

14:56.362 --> 14:59.131
Edward John Smith, he's buzzing.

14:59.131 --> 15:02.568
He's like signing autographs,
he's signing people's tits.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.004
He's got like 50 bras.
(sniffs)

15:05.004 --> 15:08.607
He's sniffing knickers people
have given him. He's a rock star!

15:08.607 --> 15:10.009
(clears throat)

15:10.009 --> 15:13.846
So, erm, first mistake to make,
lifeboats.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.049
There should have been 64 lifeboats.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.918
He's just like,
"This ship is unsinkable."

15:19.918 --> 15:22.087
"You don't need lifeboats."

15:22.087 --> 15:25.758
And they said, "OK, we'll put
none on." He went, "Ah, put 20 on."

15:25.758 --> 15:28.327
They head off.
They have, in their defence,

15:28.327 --> 15:31.563
they have four days without incident.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.133
Throughout the four days,
they are given six...

15:36.035 --> 15:39.905
...six. Six warnings of icebergs.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.774
And he just ignores them all.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.475
(phone rings)

15:43.475 --> 15:46.045
"Edward, icebergs are really bad."

15:46.045 --> 15:47.680
"Yeah, thanks. Noted."

15:47.680 --> 15:49.014
Phone down.

15:49.014 --> 15:53.919
So, Bruce Ismay, he says,
"Look, forget about the icebergs."

15:53.919 --> 15:56.188
"Why don't you
put your foot down a bit,

15:56.188 --> 15:59.958
we'll get to New York a bit faster.
Cos we'll make more headlines."

15:59.958 --> 16:03.362
So, like a chav in a Sierra Cosworth,

16:03.362 --> 16:06.065
puts his foot down and...
(makes revving sound)

16:06.065 --> 16:09.868
So they're hammering now.
They're hammering full speed ahead.

16:09.868 --> 16:13.005
Then there's a safety drill
planned for one of the days,

16:13.005 --> 16:15.074
and it's inexplicably cancelled.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.277
There's no record anywhere
of why it's cancelled.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.347
So the guy comes up
and he's like, "Captain!"

16:21.347 --> 16:24.083
"Captain Edward John Smith."

16:24.083 --> 16:27.519
"Captain Edward John Smith.
Captain Edward Smith."

16:27.519 --> 16:30.055
Everyone wants to know
what's gonna happen

16:30.055 --> 16:33.225
in the event
that this unsinkable ship sinks?

16:33.225 --> 16:36.028
And he's like...
(blows raspberry)

16:38.330 --> 16:40.466
That's just gonna depress everyone.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.435
No one wants to know
what's gonna happen if they die.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.104
It's an unsinkable ship.

16:46.872 --> 16:50.642
They jinxed it. They massively
jinxed it. Now... (laughs)

16:50.642 --> 16:54.046
Frederick Fleet...
Alliteration in the name's amazing.

16:54.046 --> 16:58.951
Frederick Fleet, his main job
is to look out for icebergs.

16:58.951 --> 17:04.056
Now, legend has it that 30 seconds,

17:04.056 --> 17:06.023
30 seconds either way,

17:06.023 --> 17:09.595
would have marked life or death
for the people on the Titanic.

17:09.595 --> 17:13.432
Now, Frederick Fleet is on the deck,
he's looking out for icebergs.

17:13.432 --> 17:17.136
But my God, there's a bloody Zumba
class happening.

17:17.136 --> 17:21.240
He's having a look
at the young girls Zumbaing away.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.308
He's seen nothing like it
in his life!

17:23.308 --> 17:27.646
And then at the last minute, he looks
up from some Zumba and he sees...

17:27.646 --> 17:31.383
"Iceberg. Ice... Iceberg!"
(honks)

17:31.383 --> 17:33.519
"Iceberg, dead ahead."

17:33.519 --> 17:34.853
He freaks out.

17:34.853 --> 17:39.024
This is the moment of training
that he thought would never happen.

17:39.024 --> 17:44.463
He phones up to the bridge
and he says, "Iceberg, dead ahead."

17:44.463 --> 17:48.534
Someone at the other end goes,
"Thank you," and puts the phone down.

17:49.768 --> 17:53.505
Genuinely true. It was like the stars
of fannying on were aligned,

17:53.505 --> 17:55.274
so enough people fannied on.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.043
The guy's messing around,
there's a delay on that.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.212
They he phones up, they go, "Thanks."

18:00.212 --> 18:03.482
And they tell the captain,
and then he's so confident,

18:03.482 --> 18:06.151
there might have been a moment
where he was like,

18:06.151 --> 18:08.487
"Iceberger?
Let's just chop it in half."

18:08.487 --> 18:12.324
There might have been a moment when
he thought, "Let's chop it in half."

18:12.324 --> 18:15.561
"What's the iceberg gonna do?"
Like, ultimate confidence,

18:15.561 --> 18:18.564
but there must have been a point
where they were like,

18:18.564 --> 18:21.033
"OK, the shit's hit the fan.
This is real."

18:21.033 --> 18:22.868
"This is genuinely real."

18:22.868 --> 18:25.270
They turn the ship
straight to the side.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.407
Left or right, whatever it was.
Let's say it's left.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.676
(grunts) Straight to the left.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.312
(mimics collision)

18:34.279 --> 18:39.284
It pops the side of the ship,
and then the water starts filling in.

18:39.284 --> 18:43.856
Thomas Andrews, the man
who designed the ship himself,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.624
said to the captain,

18:45.624 --> 18:51.730
"It is a mathematical certainty
that this ship is gonna sink."

18:51.730 --> 18:56.835
The word spreads
that this ship is going to sink.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.671
And guess what. Guess what, guys.

18:59.671 --> 19:03.075
There is not enough lifeboats.

19:03.075 --> 19:06.545
"Women and children first!
Women and children first!"

19:06.545 --> 19:08.947
"It's fine
that you've soiled yourself."

19:08.947 --> 19:12.718
"You're not a woman, it's lies!
Get back, sir!"

19:12.718 --> 19:17.990
"You stand and watch your wife
and child leaving your life forever."

19:17.990 --> 19:22.427
"It's fine.
Women and children first!"

19:23.562 --> 19:25.063
Pretty dark.

19:25.063 --> 19:29.134
Apparently,
Edward John Smith, the captain,

19:29.134 --> 19:32.838
famously said to everyone,
"We're fucked."

19:32.838 --> 19:35.374
"Do you know what I mean?
We're going down."

19:35.374 --> 19:37.476
"Good game. Good game. Good game."

19:37.476 --> 19:39.912
"It's over.
I'm going down with the ship."

19:39.912 --> 19:42.247
"But hey, be British."

19:42.247 --> 19:44.917
"What does that mean, Edward?
It's so vague."

19:44.917 --> 19:47.052
"What the fuck? It's like a riddle."

19:47.052 --> 19:50.556
"It's like, 'Don't feed them
after midnight.' It's a riddle."

19:50.556 --> 19:54.760
"This is Edward John Smith, your
captain. The ship is going down."

19:54.760 --> 19:58.030
"As the ship goes down and
you perish and fall to your death,

19:58.030 --> 20:01.800
and you sink and you die
and you freeze, please remember...

20:01.800 --> 20:04.136
...be British."

20:04.136 --> 20:07.506
They took "be British"
as stiff upper lip,

20:07.506 --> 20:11.743
and they queued politely
for the lifeboats.

20:11.743 --> 20:15.280
They took a ticket from the
delicatessen machine and waited.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.151
They went, "If I make it, I make it.
If I don't, I don't. Not a problem."

20:19.151 --> 20:23.188
And sadly, over 1,500 people died...

20:23.188 --> 20:26.925
...because of queuing
for the lifeboats.

20:26.925 --> 20:32.431
But... Charles Joughin,
the baker on the Titanic,

20:32.431 --> 20:35.067
interpreted the phrase "be British"

20:35.067 --> 20:39.838
in the way that we would
interpret it now in 2016.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.608
Charles Joughin... got pissed.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.243
Charles basically stands there,

20:45.243 --> 20:48.447
probably takes his top off,
he takes his chef's hat off.

20:48.447 --> 20:53.318
He just smears icing all over himself
in a big "T" for Titanic.

20:53.318 --> 20:56.188
He's going, "Yeah, I'm British!"

20:56.188 --> 20:59.558
And he just gets absolutely steaming.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.893
And he gets so drunk
to the point that,

21:01.893 --> 21:07.065
when he finally enters
the icy depths,

21:07.065 --> 21:09.935
it doesn't affect him
because he's so drunk

21:09.935 --> 21:12.971
and his blood has been so thinned
by the alcohol,

21:12.971 --> 21:16.675
hyperthermia can't set in
cos his blood can't set.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.544
And he gets rescued and he's fine,

21:19.544 --> 21:23.682
and it's cos he was British
and he was pissed.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.918
And that's why Charles is my hero.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.687
You fucking did it, lad.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.555
(laughs)

21:30.555 --> 21:33.158
The only thing more steaming
than the Titanic

21:33.158 --> 21:35.927
is Chris Ramsey talking about it.

21:35.927 --> 21:39.798
That's it for tonight's show. Time
for our drunk comics to head home.

21:39.798 --> 21:43.602
After all, that taxi isn't gonna be
sick in the back of itself, is it?

21:43.602 --> 21:44.970
Good night.
