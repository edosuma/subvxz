01:48.627 --> 01:49.860
They're outside.

01:51.365 --> 01:53.931
<i>Alert. Condition: Red.</i>

01:53.933 --> 01:55.000
We're losing power

01:55.002 --> 01:56.368
in the containment chamber.

03:11.911 --> 03:13.143
You hear that?

03:13.145 --> 03:14.646
Something's close.

03:15.882 --> 03:17.949
See? This is
what I'm talking about.

03:17.951 --> 03:19.316
My heart is pounding.

03:19.318 --> 03:20.958
Get down, get down.

03:25.826 --> 03:28.362
Cubone.

03:31.832 --> 03:33.367
A Cubone?

03:37.337 --> 03:39.671
We're not catching you
a Pokemon, are we?

03:39.673 --> 03:40.772
What?

03:40.774 --> 03:42.673
Tell me
you didn't plan this, Jack.

03:42.675 --> 03:43.776
Jack, tell me

03:43.778 --> 03:45.409
- you didn't plan this.
- Are you serious?

03:45.411 --> 03:48.281
How dare you. Okay?
Of course not. Come on.

03:49.016 --> 03:50.584
Okay, maybe.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.117
There was a full moon
last night

03:53.119 --> 03:54.451
and my mom heard it
crying its eyes out.

03:54.453 --> 03:56.054
She thought I was
having a nightmare,

03:56.056 --> 03:57.855
so she brought me
a glass of warm milk.

03:57.857 --> 04:00.191
Dude, I thought you wanted to,
you know, hang out

04:00.193 --> 04:01.325
and relive the good old days.

04:01.327 --> 04:02.392
Like when we were kids.

04:02.394 --> 04:05.363
I do. But just look at it.

04:05.365 --> 04:08.565
That is the perfect Pokemon
for you.

04:10.002 --> 04:13.403
Jack, I'm not looking for
a Pokemon. I've told you this.

04:13.405 --> 04:15.439
I've thought long and hard
about this, okay?

04:15.441 --> 04:16.808
Water-type
is not right for you.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.541
Neither is Fire-type.
But Cubone is...

04:18.543 --> 04:19.611
Lonely.

04:19.613 --> 04:21.512
Exactly.

04:21.514 --> 04:23.748
Okay, thank you, Jack.
Thank you for that.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.383
Are there any other
emotional truth-bombs

04:25.385 --> 04:26.885
you wanna drop on me?

04:26.887 --> 04:29.387
Maybe later. But right now
the truth is in my hands.

04:33.026 --> 04:35.726
- Just give me the Ball.
- Yes. Yes!

04:35.728 --> 04:38.996
Okay, remember, catching
a Pokemon is not about skill.

04:38.998 --> 04:40.065
So you can do this.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.298
Good pep talk.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.202
Okay.
It has to choose you, too.

04:43.204 --> 04:46.137
So make it wanna be
your partner.

04:46.139 --> 04:48.539
Hey, Cubone.
What's up, buddy?

04:48.541 --> 04:49.407
You know,

04:49.409 --> 04:51.476
not everyone can pull off

04:51.478 --> 04:54.279
wearing the skull
of their dead relative,

04:54.281 --> 04:57.015
but, you know, you sure can.

04:59.019 --> 05:01.318
Okay, he didn't like that.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.123
He did not like that.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.224
Jack.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.825
Throw it!

05:08.827 --> 05:09.995
Throw the Ball.

05:09.997 --> 05:11.796
Like a man.

05:16.236 --> 05:18.204
Uh-oh. Cubone.

05:18.738 --> 05:19.739
Cubone!

05:23.543 --> 05:24.943
I did it!

05:26.413 --> 05:27.848
Still got it.

05:31.918 --> 05:33.750
The light's not green.

05:33.752 --> 05:35.186
It still hasn't
turned green yet, Jack.

05:35.188 --> 05:36.753
That's bad, right?

05:36.755 --> 05:38.423
Run!

05:42.329 --> 05:44.596
- It didn't choose me!
- Run!

05:44.598 --> 05:47.364
- It didn't choose me, Jack!
- I can see that!

05:47.366 --> 05:48.568
I'm not its choice!

05:54.240 --> 05:57.274
Cubone!

05:57.276 --> 05:58.676
<i>That was
one angry Cubone.</i>

05:58.678 --> 06:00.846
<i>He reminded me
a lot of my mom.</i>

06:00.848 --> 06:03.046
So, um, I don't know
if this is gonna sound

06:03.048 --> 06:04.481
corny or whatever...

06:04.483 --> 06:06.584
Just say it, Jack.
I'm too tired to be angry.

06:06.586 --> 06:08.219
I'm worried about you.

06:08.221 --> 06:09.654
This again?

06:09.656 --> 06:11.289
Hey, listen, everyone we know
has left town

06:11.291 --> 06:12.623
and now I'm leaving, too.

06:12.625 --> 06:13.859
Yeah, but that's okay.

06:13.861 --> 06:15.159
You gotta do
what's best for you

06:15.161 --> 06:16.226
with the time that you got.

06:16.228 --> 06:17.395
That's what I'm doing.

06:17.397 --> 06:19.431
You know,
I'm crushing it at work.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.666
I'm gonna get
a promotion real soon.

06:21.668 --> 06:24.635
What's the promotion
for an insurance appraiser?

06:24.637 --> 06:26.938
"Senior insurance appraiser"?

06:26.940 --> 06:28.974
No, actually,
that's two steps up

06:28.976 --> 06:30.375
above where I'm at right now.

06:30.377 --> 06:31.777
You're gonna make me
throw up.

06:31.779 --> 06:33.678
That's not a real thing.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.246
Oh, I finally have service.

06:36.248 --> 06:37.481
Wait, five voicemails?

06:37.483 --> 06:39.416
Why would I have
five voicemails?

06:39.418 --> 06:41.621
Maybe it's an insurance
emergency.

06:45.190 --> 06:46.560
Who is it?

06:49.029 --> 06:53.267
Um, it's the Ryme City
Police Department.

06:54.099 --> 06:55.802
There was an accident.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.032
Please don't.

07:29.034 --> 07:30.702
Mmm.

07:30.704 --> 07:33.837
I actually meant, "Please do".
Thank you.

07:33.839 --> 07:36.844
Thank you. You have
a very generous tongue.

07:39.979 --> 07:42.349
Does this Lickitung
belong to anyone?

07:43.382 --> 07:45.015
Anybody? No?

07:45.017 --> 07:46.883
<i>Thank you
for travelling with us.</i>

07:46.885 --> 07:49.786
<i>Please sit back and watch this
short informational video</i>

07:49.788 --> 07:52.556
<i>welcoming you to Ryme City.</i>

07:52.558 --> 07:53.991
<i>Throughout history,</i>

07:53.993 --> 07:56.226
<i>Pokemon have been
part of our world.</i>

07:56.228 --> 07:57.695
<i>Squirtle.</i>

07:57.697 --> 07:59.229
<i>Early humans
used to catch them</i>

07:59.231 --> 08:02.467
<i>and train them to use
their unique powers</i>

08:02.469 --> 08:05.070
<i>for the common good.</i>

08:05.072 --> 08:06.671
<i>This relationship evolved</i>

08:06.673 --> 08:10.411
<i>into what we now refer
to as Pokemon battles.</i>

08:13.846 --> 08:16.513
<i>One man changed all of this.</i>

08:16.515 --> 08:18.015
<i>Howard Clifford,</i>

08:18.017 --> 08:21.885
<i>founder and chairman
of Clifford Industries.</i>

08:21.887 --> 08:24.856
<i>Diagnosed with
a rare degenerative disease,</i>

08:24.858 --> 08:26.724
<i>he resigned from
his corporation</i>

08:26.726 --> 08:29.260
<i>and searched the world
for a cure.</i>

08:29.262 --> 08:32.897
<i>And it turned out
that the cure I was looking for</i>

08:32.899 --> 08:36.534
<i>was for me to evolve into
a better version of myself.</i>

08:36.535 --> 08:37.967
<i>And I discovered
how to do that</i>

08:37.970 --> 08:39.703
<i>through a partnership
with Pokemon.</i>

08:39.705 --> 08:43.875
<i>And he wanted to share
that discovery with the world.</i>

08:43.876 --> 08:45.443
<i>This is what inspired</i>

08:45.445 --> 08:47.379
<i>Howard Clifford
to build Ryme City,</i>

08:47.381 --> 08:52.216
<i>a place where humans and
Pokemon can live side by side.</i>

08:52.218 --> 08:56.120
<i>Unlike other regions,
where Pokemon live in the wild,</i>

08:56.122 --> 08:59.223
<i>here, we live
and work together.</i>

08:59.225 --> 09:03.694
<i>No battles. No Trainers.
No Poke Balls.</i>

09:03.696 --> 09:07.665
<i>A stronger,
more harmonious world.</i>

09:07.667 --> 09:13.605
<i>From all our citizens:
Welcome to Ryme City.</i>

09:13.607 --> 09:15.843
Char! Charmander!

10:04.090 --> 10:06.189
<i>Fighting fires
wouldn't be the same</i>

10:06.191 --> 10:08.058
<i>without their
Squirtle partners.</i>

10:08.060 --> 10:11.665
<i>Squirtle, Squirtle.
Squirtle, Squirtle.</i>

10:35.188 --> 10:37.554
Snubbull.

10:43.829 --> 10:44.728
Hi, Tim.

10:44.730 --> 10:46.099
Lieutenant Yoshida.

10:48.634 --> 10:51.401
Your dad was the best
of the best.

10:51.403 --> 10:54.573
He was a legend
in this precinct.

10:54.575 --> 10:58.208
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.

10:58.210 --> 11:02.480
It was a terrible tragedy,
losing him and his partner.

11:02.482 --> 11:03.682
His partner?

11:03.684 --> 11:05.249
His Pokemon.

11:05.251 --> 11:06.384
Oh, I didn't...

11:06.386 --> 11:08.752
Snubbull.

11:08.754 --> 11:10.587
I'm sorry,
is yours mad at me?

11:10.589 --> 11:12.689
- Snubbull?
- Yeah.

11:12.691 --> 11:14.391
He may look grumpy
on the outside,

11:14.393 --> 11:17.828
but I assure you,
he is adorable on the inside.

11:20.233 --> 11:21.832
If you don't mind me asking,

11:21.834 --> 11:24.601
how come you don't have
a Pokemon?

11:24.603 --> 11:27.038
I thought I remember
Harry saying

11:27.040 --> 11:29.808
you wanted to be a Pokemon
Trainer when you were young.

11:29.810 --> 11:32.143
Yeah, that didn't really
work out.

11:32.145 --> 11:35.480
Uh, I work
in insurance now, so...

11:35.482 --> 11:37.017
I understand.

11:38.050 --> 11:39.650
But, Tim,

11:39.652 --> 11:41.851
please don't put this
all on yourself.

11:41.853 --> 11:44.856
No one should go through
this type of thing alone.

11:44.858 --> 11:47.324
If you are anything
like your dad...

11:47.326 --> 11:48.594
I'm not.

11:49.997 --> 11:51.996
I was just really
raised by my grandmother.

11:51.998 --> 11:53.630
Do you have the spare keys
for his apartment?

11:53.632 --> 11:55.598
I should go wrap things
up there.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.103
Of course.

11:57.603 --> 11:58.805
Of course.

12:00.773 --> 12:02.774
- Here's his address.
- Awesome.

12:02.776 --> 12:04.308
I can take you over
if you want.

12:04.310 --> 12:08.549
No. Nope. I'm all good.
Thank you so much.

12:11.751 --> 12:13.053
Tim.

12:16.489 --> 12:18.121
This job,

12:18.123 --> 12:20.457
it demands a lot.

12:20.459 --> 12:22.959
But you were on his mind
every day.

12:22.961 --> 12:26.766
He loved you more than
anything else in the world.

12:32.338 --> 12:35.939
Uh, it was nice to meet you,
Lieutenant.

13:37.136 --> 13:38.803
Excuse me.

13:38.805 --> 13:41.041
Okay.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.319
Psyduck!

13:56.321 --> 13:57.323
Psyduck.

14:00.026 --> 14:02.059
Are you trying to rob me,
or just annoy me?

14:02.061 --> 14:03.930
- Psyduck.
- He's with me.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.966
- We need to talk.
- We do?

14:08.968 --> 14:10.134
I've been waiting to see

14:10.136 --> 14:11.869
who would open up
that mailbox.

14:11.871 --> 14:15.305
You just walked into
quite a story.

14:15.307 --> 14:19.076
Stories like this spread fear.
And they're afraid of fear.

14:19.078 --> 14:20.412
But I don't fear fear.

14:20.414 --> 14:21.913
I walk the walk
and I talk the talk.

14:21.915 --> 14:23.380
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

14:23.382 --> 14:26.053
to get the honest scoop,
and that's the hard truth.

14:27.820 --> 14:31.688
I'm sorry. Who are you?

14:31.690 --> 14:34.726
Lucy Stevens.
Reporter for CNM.

14:34.728 --> 14:37.798
Oh. You seem kinda young
for that.

14:38.564 --> 14:40.030
I work for the CNM blog,

14:40.032 --> 14:41.631
making Pokemon listicles
all day, okay?

14:41.633 --> 14:43.900
- Top 10 Cutest Pokemon.
- Yeah, my grandma loves those.

14:43.902 --> 14:45.635
Yeah, news flash:
they're all cute.

14:45.637 --> 14:46.871
Such a waste of time

14:46.873 --> 14:48.338
for someone with
my nose for a story.

14:49.242 --> 14:50.875
Oh, no, no, not now, Psyduck.

14:50.877 --> 14:52.276
I'm working a source.
Just one more minute.

14:52.278 --> 14:54.478
Okay, I'm gonna...

14:54.480 --> 14:56.313
I'm gonna need you to go
on record and tell me

14:56.315 --> 14:58.852
everything you know
about Harry Goodman.

15:00.653 --> 15:01.952
Wait, what?

15:01.954 --> 15:04.822
Harry was onto something big.
Real big.

15:04.824 --> 15:06.223
And then all of a sudden,

15:06.225 --> 15:08.326
his car crashes over a bridge.
I think not.

15:08.328 --> 15:10.260
Something's rotten, and I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

15:10.262 --> 15:12.163
Hey, look,
I barely know the guy.

15:12.165 --> 15:14.097
- I haven't seen him in years.
- Where's your Pokemon partner?

15:14.099 --> 15:16.668
I don't have one. Why does
everyone keep asking me that?

15:16.670 --> 15:17.901
Loner.
Probably hiding something.

15:17.903 --> 15:19.404
Okay. I'm gonna go.

15:19.406 --> 15:20.972
Hey.

15:20.974 --> 15:22.740
I may only be
an unpaid intern,

15:22.742 --> 15:24.607
but I can smell a story.

15:24.609 --> 15:26.276
And I'm going to find it.

15:26.278 --> 15:27.947
Okay. You do that.

15:30.983 --> 15:33.384
Come on, Psyduck.
Let's go.

15:33.386 --> 15:34.454
Psyduck.

15:50.637 --> 15:51.803
<i>Who is it?</i>

15:51.805 --> 15:53.169
Hello?

15:53.171 --> 15:55.908
<i>It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.</i>

15:56.943 --> 15:58.308
<i>Leave it
on the doorstep</i>

15:58.310 --> 16:00.044
<i>and get the hell out of here.</i>

16:00.046 --> 16:02.849
<i>All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?</i>

16:03.849 --> 16:06.319
Still with the old
detective movies.

16:55.901 --> 16:57.204
What?

16:59.137 --> 17:01.874
What? What is that stuff?

17:28.735 --> 17:32.436
"Dear Tim. I could do better
if you give me a chance.

17:32.438 --> 17:35.507
I'll always have a place
for you to stay."

17:37.308 --> 17:38.876
<i>The train on platform...</i>

17:38.878 --> 17:41.111
Your father will
pick you up from the station.

17:41.113 --> 17:43.081
I'm not going.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.715
- What?
- I don't wanna go.

17:44.717 --> 17:47.420
<i>This is home. I wanna stay
here with you, Grandma.</i>

18:09.909 --> 18:11.344
Oh, man.

18:13.446 --> 18:15.880
<i>This is the most
important day of my life.</i>

18:15.882 --> 18:17.447
I know, Tim.

18:17.449 --> 18:20.884
But your mother had to see
the doctor. It couldn't wait.

18:29.763 --> 18:31.164
Harry.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.482
Someone there?

18:53.353 --> 18:54.421
Hello?

19:03.796 --> 19:04.928
Oh.

19:04.930 --> 19:06.432
Ahh! That's a sprain.

19:12.904 --> 19:14.507
Okay, okay, okay.

19:16.609 --> 19:18.111
Whoever you are,

19:19.245 --> 19:21.414
I know how to use this.

19:28.953 --> 19:30.822
It's a Pikachu?

19:30.824 --> 19:32.055
Aw, jeez.

19:32.057 --> 19:35.493
Hey, little guy,
how did you get in here?

19:35.495 --> 19:39.396
I know you can't
understand me,

19:39.398 --> 19:41.297
but put down the stapler,

19:41.299 --> 19:46.205
or I will electrocute you.

19:48.841 --> 19:50.274
Did you just talk?

19:50.276 --> 19:52.509
Whoa.
Did you just understand me?

19:52.511 --> 19:54.211
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:54.213 --> 19:56.246
That is heavy eye contact
right there. You heard me.

19:56.248 --> 19:57.547
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you did.

19:57.549 --> 19:59.283
- Oh, my God. This is amazing!
- Stop!

19:59.285 --> 20:00.883
- You can understand me.
- Stop talking. Stop!

20:00.885 --> 20:02.386
I have been so lonely.

20:02.388 --> 20:04.720
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, kid. I need your help.

20:04.722 --> 20:06.690
- I'm gonna throw up.
- I'm in serious trouble.

20:06.692 --> 20:08.659
I need you to listen.

20:08.661 --> 20:10.527
- No, no, no, no.
- Excuse me, Aipom,

20:10.529 --> 20:12.129
we're having a private
conversation here, please.

20:12.131 --> 20:13.496
Stop talking.

20:13.498 --> 20:14.998
- You're a hallucination!
- You're a hallucination!

20:15.000 --> 20:17.267
And, you! Out! Shoo! Go!

20:17.269 --> 20:18.803
I'd tread lightly there,
chief.

20:18.805 --> 20:20.737
That Aipom don't look right.

20:20.739 --> 20:22.005
Ahh!

20:22.007 --> 20:23.306
No! Hey! Hey!

20:23.308 --> 20:24.975
Get off him, whack-job.

20:26.411 --> 20:29.178
Get up, kid.
He's coming back around.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.480
Okay, here's what
you wanna do.

20:30.482 --> 20:32.582
Okay, you wanna bite him.
You wanna scream.

20:32.584 --> 20:34.918
We're playing charades.
We're not playing charades.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.719
- Okay, I'm gonna get a knife.
- Not the knife!

20:36.721 --> 20:39.556
Okay, bad idea with the knife.
I'll find something else.

20:39.558 --> 20:41.292
Eat this!

20:41.294 --> 20:44.294
You are so welcome. He was
just a hungry little guy...

20:44.296 --> 20:47.297
Oh, my God!

20:47.299 --> 20:49.699
Come on, kid. Let's move.

20:53.206 --> 20:54.371
To the roof!

21:05.084 --> 21:07.650
Brilliant idea!
You hold the door.

21:07.652 --> 21:09.219
- I'll go get help.
- What?

21:09.221 --> 21:12.357
Help! Help! Oh, my God! Help!

21:16.728 --> 21:17.863
Oh, sh...

21:19.265 --> 21:21.931
Help! Help! Oh, my God, help!

21:21.933 --> 21:26.736
Oh, he's being eaten alive!
He's being eaten alive!

21:26.738 --> 21:28.505
A man is dying!

21:38.316 --> 21:40.450
No one's coming.
People are so insensitive.

21:40.452 --> 21:42.319
Uh-oh. Put your pants back on

21:42.321 --> 21:43.756
and run like the wind.

21:45.357 --> 21:48.227
Blazing speed! Blazing speed!

21:50.196 --> 21:53.965
No, they seem to be attracted
to your increasing nudeness.

21:53.967 --> 21:55.732
Okay.

21:55.734 --> 21:57.534
All right,
we're jumping down here.

21:57.536 --> 21:59.402
No! No! I'm not going in
the trash chute.

21:59.404 --> 22:01.338
Good call.
Let me know how it goes

22:01.340 --> 22:03.107
with the super crazy Pokemon.

22:03.109 --> 22:04.440
You died a hero.

22:12.684 --> 22:13.949
Way to stick the landing, kid.

22:13.951 --> 22:15.218
Leave me alone!

22:16.921 --> 22:20.291
Oh. Looks like someone's back
in a good mood.

22:20.293 --> 22:23.427
Run! Rabid Aipom!

22:23.429 --> 22:25.362
Look out! Run!

22:25.364 --> 22:29.199
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
They're... Go! They...

22:30.736 --> 22:33.739
I think pants are gonna do you
a lot of good right now.

22:36.742 --> 22:37.975
Shoo! Go.

22:37.977 --> 22:39.377
You know, I pictured you

22:39.379 --> 22:41.111
as a bit of a briefs guy,
but those are nice.

22:41.113 --> 22:44.747
Me? I don't wear underwear,
you know? I'm not modest.

22:44.749 --> 22:46.483
Excuse me, excuse me, hi.
Sorry.

22:46.485 --> 22:48.185
Uh, you can hear him, right?
You can hear him talking?

22:48.187 --> 22:50.287
- Pika-Pika. Pika. Pikachu.
- Aw.

22:50.289 --> 22:53.424
Yeah. Pika-Pika. Pika.
He's adorable.

22:53.426 --> 22:55.458
You're adorable.
They can't understand me, kid.

22:55.460 --> 22:59.095
It's me. It's that stuff
that I put up my nose.

22:59.097 --> 23:00.730
Not like that.
No, it was a gas.

23:00.732 --> 23:02.265
- I was breathing gas.
- Hey, hey, hey.

23:02.267 --> 23:03.432
Accidentally.
I was accidentally...

23:03.434 --> 23:05.502
Ix-nay on the gas-ay.

23:05.504 --> 23:06.870
Unless you want Johnny Law
to give you

23:06.872 --> 23:08.170
a one-way ticket
to the hoosegow, let's move.

23:08.172 --> 23:09.371
No one else can hear him?

23:09.373 --> 23:10.474
This is a first for me,
too, kid.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.775
He's saying words.

23:11.777 --> 23:13.043
Try to talk to people
all the time.

23:13.045 --> 23:14.011
All they hear is "Pika-Pika".

23:14.013 --> 23:15.313
They pat me or kiss me,

23:15.315 --> 23:17.013
stick a finger in me.
It's really gross.

23:17.015 --> 23:18.582
Can no one else hear him?

23:18.584 --> 23:20.484
Can you hear him talking?
Do you hear him saying words?

23:20.486 --> 23:22.352
What are you not
getting here, kid?

23:22.354 --> 23:23.853
You're the only one
who can hear me.

23:23.855 --> 23:25.855
- It's like destiny.
- It's not destiny.

23:25.857 --> 23:27.557
Then why were you
in that apartment?

23:27.559 --> 23:29.926
It's my father's place.
That's why I was there.

23:29.928 --> 23:32.599
- Why were you there?
- You're Harry's son?

23:36.168 --> 23:37.904
How do you know his name?

23:45.844 --> 23:48.280
You're Harry's
Pokemon partner?

23:49.382 --> 23:50.984
You want a coffee?

23:52.551 --> 23:54.484
'Cause I could use a coffee.
I mean...

23:54.486 --> 23:56.786
Yeah. Let's get a coffee.

23:56.788 --> 23:58.657
Yeah. Come on.

24:11.237 --> 24:13.803
<i>So there
I was in the middle of nowhere</i>

24:13.805 --> 24:16.274
<i>with a bad case
of the forgetsies.</i>

24:16.276 --> 24:18.074
The only clue to my past
is Harry's name

24:18.076 --> 24:20.076
and address inside this hat.

24:20.078 --> 24:21.711
So I made my way
to the apartment

24:21.713 --> 24:23.345
and that's when I found you.

24:23.347 --> 24:26.082
<i>♪ Jigglypuff ♪</i>

24:26.084 --> 24:27.551
I don't know.
Maybe Harry got in too deep.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.852
Deep in what?

24:28.854 --> 24:30.519
You know, mixed up
with the wrong crowd,

24:30.521 --> 24:32.989
that kinda thing.
Happens to the best of us.

24:32.991 --> 24:35.524
The debts pile up.
The walls close in.

24:35.526 --> 24:38.294
Right becomes wrong.
Wrong becomes wrong.

24:38.296 --> 24:39.796
- Wait, who you calling?
- No one.

24:39.798 --> 24:42.698
Yeah, that sounds great.
This menu looks really nice.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.101
Wait, I'm confused.

24:44.103 --> 24:45.768
Are you hearing
other voices besides mine?

24:45.770 --> 24:47.236
All I wanna know is why
I can understand you.

24:47.238 --> 24:48.871
Ho! Can't help you there, kid.

24:48.873 --> 24:52.475
Like I said, I have amnesia.
Can't remember a darn thing.

24:52.477 --> 24:53.878
Okay, so you're
a talking Pikachu

24:53.880 --> 24:55.845
with no memories,
who's addicted to caffeine.

24:55.847 --> 24:59.181
I could stop whenever I want.
These are just choices.

24:59.183 --> 25:00.649
Another round. Extra shot.

25:00.651 --> 25:02.018
Black as night.
Thank you, sweetie.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.454
Ludicolo!

25:03.456 --> 25:04.955
Look,
I'm a great detective.

25:04.957 --> 25:06.657
But I can't solve my own
mystery if I have no memory.

25:06.659 --> 25:07.957
Then how do you even know
you're a detective?

25:07.959 --> 25:10.561
Well, I can feel that
in my jellies.

25:10.563 --> 25:11.928
What is that? What is that?

25:11.930 --> 25:13.796
It's the jellies.
It's that thing, you know?

25:13.798 --> 25:16.667
You feel it when you
really believe in something

25:16.669 --> 25:18.669
despite everyone telling you
you're wrong.

25:18.671 --> 25:20.637
Which is why I need
to find Harry.

25:20.639 --> 25:22.005
He's the key to my past.

25:22.007 --> 25:23.974
- Ludicolo.
- Thanks, doll.

25:23.976 --> 25:27.811
I got some bad news for you
'cause, uh, Harry's dead.

25:29.715 --> 25:33.950
What? No. No, no, no.
No, Harry ain't dead.

25:33.952 --> 25:36.754
No, Harry is dead.
You're wrong. I'm sorry.

25:36.756 --> 25:38.455
I saw in the police report
that he's dead.

25:38.457 --> 25:39.890
Just 'cause the cops say
he's dead...

25:39.892 --> 25:41.291
It means that
he's legally dead.

25:41.293 --> 25:43.563
Really? Did they find a body?

25:44.629 --> 25:46.196
Oh, I didn't think so.

25:46.198 --> 25:49.365
And, by the way, did that
report also say that I'm dead?

25:49.367 --> 25:50.633
'Cause if I'm still alive
and kicking,

25:50.635 --> 25:52.101
that means Harry's
out there, too.

25:52.103 --> 25:53.336
Case closed.

25:53.338 --> 25:55.339
But still open
until I solve it.

25:55.341 --> 25:57.306
Okay, I'll bite. Solve what?

25:57.308 --> 25:58.541
Oh, I'm glad
you're gonna bite.

25:58.543 --> 26:00.709
All right. Here it is.

26:00.711 --> 26:03.013
Harry faked his own death.

26:03.015 --> 26:06.015
Or somebody else faked
Harry's death.

26:06.017 --> 26:09.852
Or Harry faked
somebody else's death.

26:09.854 --> 26:12.156
That last one
doesn't work at all.

26:12.158 --> 26:14.357
- No, it doesn't.
- The first two are contenders.

26:14.359 --> 26:15.758
No, I'm gonna go.
We're done here.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.226
- No, we are not done here.
- This is...

26:17.228 --> 26:19.596
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.
Where're you going?

26:19.598 --> 26:21.698
Hold up a sec.
We're gonna need each other.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.735
No, we don't. I don't need
a Pokemon. Period. Got it?

26:24.737 --> 26:26.302
Then what about
a world-class detective?

26:26.304 --> 26:29.540
Because if you wanna find
your pops, I'm your best bet.

26:29.542 --> 26:30.674
I think
a world-class detective

26:30.676 --> 26:32.042
oughta have figured out by now

26:32.044 --> 26:34.311
that I'm not here
to find my father.

26:34.313 --> 26:36.013
I'm here to say goodbye.

26:36.015 --> 26:38.848
Hey, hey. There's no one
to say goodbye to.

26:38.850 --> 26:41.418
Look, you can talk to humans.
I can talk to Pokemon.

26:41.420 --> 26:43.085
We can talk to each other.

26:43.087 --> 26:46.457
This doesn't happen, kid.
It has to mean something.

26:46.459 --> 26:48.659
There's magic that
brought us together,

26:48.661 --> 26:51.797
and that magic is called hope.

26:53.332 --> 26:56.602
Hope that
Harry is still alive.

27:00.773 --> 27:04.707
Oh, you feel it. You feel it
in your jellies, don't you?

27:04.709 --> 27:06.442
There's nothing in my jellies.

27:06.444 --> 27:09.548
We're gonna do this.
You and me.

27:12.116 --> 27:14.583
I can't belie...

27:14.585 --> 27:16.821
I will meet you here
tomorrow morning.

27:16.823 --> 27:18.522
Great.

27:18.524 --> 27:20.457
- Where're you going?
- To my apartment.

27:20.459 --> 27:21.559
What do you mean,
"Your apartment"?

27:21.561 --> 27:22.825
What?

27:22.827 --> 27:24.160
All right,
you can sleep on the couch.

27:24.162 --> 27:26.030
No, I'm not gonna sleep
on the couch.

27:26.032 --> 27:27.630
Well, then
you can sleep on the stove.

27:27.632 --> 27:29.365
Be a dear, would you,
and get the door for me.

27:29.367 --> 27:30.633
What am I doing?

27:30.635 --> 27:31.534
I just invited

27:31.536 --> 27:33.003
someone to my apartment.

27:33.005 --> 27:35.775
I never do this.
I'm not that kind of Pokemon.

27:40.211 --> 27:41.411
Dust everywhere.

27:41.413 --> 27:42.981
No fingerprints.

27:43.681 --> 27:45.881
Ugh. Doesn't add up.

27:45.883 --> 27:47.517
What is going on in here?

27:47.519 --> 27:49.419
I'm searching the joint,
looking for clues.

27:49.421 --> 27:50.853
- Is this your room?
- No.

27:50.855 --> 27:52.555
Does Harry have
other children?

27:52.557 --> 27:54.225
No.

27:54.227 --> 27:56.059
He wanted me to live here
when I was a kid,

27:56.061 --> 27:58.461
so he made it look like
my childhood room.

27:58.463 --> 27:59.830
Should we talk about the fact

27:59.832 --> 28:01.832
that your childhood bed
is a Pikachu bed?

28:01.834 --> 28:02.899
It's a coincidence.

28:02.901 --> 28:04.501
I'm sorry. Can you speak up?

28:04.503 --> 28:05.936
I can't hear you.

28:05.938 --> 28:07.169
I've never been so flattered

28:07.171 --> 28:08.805
and creeped out
at the same time.

28:08.807 --> 28:10.573
Are you gonna make me
into a lampshade?

28:10.575 --> 28:11.675
Oh, I might.

28:11.677 --> 28:13.142
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

28:13.144 --> 28:15.178
All these Pokemon cards
and the battle posters...

28:15.180 --> 28:17.613
There's a connection,
isn't there?

28:17.615 --> 28:20.382
- You love Pokemon.
- No.

28:20.384 --> 28:21.618
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.018
That was a long time ago,

28:23.020 --> 28:24.688
before my father
moved to the city

28:24.690 --> 28:26.689
and spent more time with
Pokemon than his own son.

28:26.691 --> 28:28.592
Mmm, yeah,
blame it on your dad.

28:28.594 --> 28:30.093
Okay, look, what about this?

28:30.095 --> 28:31.928
There's pictures of her
all over the apartment.

28:31.930 --> 28:33.362
She's obviously connected
to Harry.

28:33.364 --> 28:35.165
She might know me.

28:35.167 --> 28:36.533
She could be a lead.

28:36.535 --> 28:38.237
No, she's not.

28:39.337 --> 28:40.903
That's my mom.

28:40.905 --> 28:42.872
She passed away when I was 11.

28:42.874 --> 28:46.142
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

28:46.144 --> 28:47.747
I didn't realize.

28:51.283 --> 28:53.284
Tomorrow morning
I'm gonna take you to Yoshida

28:53.286 --> 28:55.121
so we can get some answers.

29:24.248 --> 29:25.815
Ahh, my clues!

29:25.817 --> 29:27.115
What is all this?

29:27.117 --> 29:28.784
Hard work.
That's what this is.

29:28.786 --> 29:30.652
And, by the way,
we can't go to the cops.

29:30.654 --> 29:32.322
Not till we know
who we can trust.

29:32.324 --> 29:34.291
So put my clues back in order,
would you?

29:34.293 --> 29:36.258
These aren't clues. This is
the work of a serial killer.

29:36.260 --> 29:37.159
They're almost clues.

29:37.161 --> 29:38.661
What does that even mean?

29:38.663 --> 29:40.130
Trying to jog my memory,
retrace my steps.

29:40.132 --> 29:42.232
It helps me
to see it all laid out.

29:42.234 --> 29:43.633
That's how I found this.

29:43.635 --> 29:46.736
This is what a Frenchman
would call <i>caliente fiesta.</i>

29:46.738 --> 29:47.838
Not French.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.037
Smell my finger.

29:49.039 --> 29:51.174
I will never
smell your finger.

29:51.176 --> 29:52.275
Coward.

29:52.277 --> 29:53.976
The point is,
I smelled this R stuff

29:53.978 --> 29:55.911
on those Aipom when
they attacked us yesterday.

29:55.913 --> 29:57.447
- R?
- Bingo!

29:57.449 --> 29:59.017
<i>La Cucaracha.</i>

29:59.785 --> 30:03.086
See, I'm thinking Harry

30:03.088 --> 30:04.755
caught a break in the case,

30:04.757 --> 30:06.355
forcing our shadowy kingpin

30:06.357 --> 30:09.659
to send out hired goons
to deliver the big hush-hush.

30:09.661 --> 30:11.093
We need to retrace
Harry's steps.

30:11.095 --> 30:12.695
Either solve
the case ourselves

30:12.697 --> 30:14.130
or get far enough
along that this

30:14.132 --> 30:16.600
A-number-one bad guy
has to reveal himself.

30:16.602 --> 30:18.601
- Or herself!
- Can you stop doing that?

30:18.603 --> 30:20.938
So, what is the way in, huh?

30:20.940 --> 30:22.438
The answer is in this room.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.674
This isn't a room.
This is a fire hazard.

30:24.676 --> 30:27.913
It's just junk
and papers and...

30:30.149 --> 30:31.614
Newspapers.

30:31.616 --> 30:33.082
What you got, kid?

30:33.084 --> 30:34.951
I literally just met someone.

30:34.953 --> 30:37.553
She was a... She was
a junior reporter at CNM.

30:37.555 --> 30:39.957
She was doing a story
on Harry.

30:39.959 --> 30:41.890
I think she knows
more than she let on.

30:41.892 --> 30:43.927
The smart ones always do.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.829
We gotta go down to her work
and press her.

30:45.831 --> 30:47.063
- Okay.
- That's a metaphor.

30:47.065 --> 30:48.865
Yeah, I know
what a metaphor is.

30:48.867 --> 30:50.233
Uh, I was drinking that.

30:50.235 --> 30:51.668
I was also drink...
Just step anywhere.

30:51.670 --> 30:53.035
It's only my life's work.

30:53.037 --> 30:55.572
No. No, we're not doing that.

30:55.574 --> 30:57.005
Fine, I'll walk.

30:57.007 --> 30:59.879
I'm trying to get in
100,000 steps this hour.

31:01.979 --> 31:04.781
<i>Hello, I'm Roger Clifford,
president of CNM</i>

31:04.783 --> 31:06.549
and chairman
of Clifford Enterprises.

31:06.551 --> 31:08.017
And I'm Howard Clifford,

31:08.019 --> 31:10.219
the visionary icon
behind Ryme City.

31:10.221 --> 31:12.322
Together,
in the spirit of harmony,

31:12.324 --> 31:14.090
we're throwing
the largest parade

31:14.092 --> 31:15.958
that Ryme City has ever seen.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.526
You won't wanna miss it.

31:17.528 --> 31:19.763
So, at the weekend,
we invite the people...

31:19.765 --> 31:21.398
And the Pokemon
to be there.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.065
A celebration
of the harmony

31:23.067 --> 31:26.268
between humans and Pokemon.

31:26.270 --> 31:28.706
And, cut!

31:28.708 --> 31:30.207
Well, I think
that went rather well.

31:30.209 --> 31:31.440
Oh, shut up, Dad!

31:31.442 --> 31:32.810
He seems nice.

31:32.812 --> 31:34.610
Roger, please.
This is supposed to be

31:34.612 --> 31:36.478
our gift to the citizens.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.614
"Visionary icon"? Really?

31:38.616 --> 31:40.617
Was "savior of
the world" taken?

31:40.619 --> 31:43.152
It was your people who wrote
the promo, son.

31:43.154 --> 31:44.986
Oh, is there
an unabridged version

31:44.988 --> 31:47.090
where you cure cancer?

31:47.092 --> 31:48.457
Oh, that's right, yeah.

31:48.459 --> 31:50.392
Turn your back on me
like you always did.

31:50.394 --> 31:51.460
Ditto!

31:51.462 --> 31:53.396
By the way, no one
likes your Pokemon!

31:53.398 --> 31:54.465
There she is.

31:56.067 --> 31:57.566
I can see
why you were so excited.

31:57.568 --> 32:00.236
I was... Okay,
I was not that excited.

32:00.238 --> 32:01.839
Mr. Clifford!
Mr. Clifford!

32:01.841 --> 32:04.440
Mr. Clifford,
I may have a story for you.

32:04.442 --> 32:07.009
I've heard rumors
of Pokemon attacking people.

32:07.011 --> 32:08.477
But there's been
no mainstream coverage.

32:08.479 --> 32:10.380
I'm sorry,
we're not a tabloid.

32:10.382 --> 32:12.248
Which means
that we don't report

32:12.250 --> 32:15.384
on rumors, gossip or hearsay.

32:15.386 --> 32:18.287
It's not news
if it can't be verified.

32:18.289 --> 32:22.359
You want a story,
find a source.

32:22.361 --> 32:24.296
Oh, and pro tip:

32:25.264 --> 32:27.967
A reasonable sense of fashion.

32:39.143 --> 32:40.409
Here she comes.

32:40.411 --> 32:41.777
Here she comes.
Try to look deep.

32:41.779 --> 32:43.545
What are you doing here?

32:43.547 --> 32:44.915
Hey, again. Uh...

32:44.917 --> 32:46.349
Yeah, I know this seems weird

32:46.351 --> 32:48.552
but I actually needed
to ask you something.

32:48.554 --> 32:50.553
Now's not really a good time.

32:50.555 --> 32:54.122
Yeah, I saw that. I'm sorry.

32:58.729 --> 33:01.130
Sorry. It's piping hot.

33:01.132 --> 33:03.967
You found yourself
a Pokemon partner.

33:03.969 --> 33:05.567
- Not exactly, no.
- Aw.

33:05.569 --> 33:07.169
He's cute.

33:07.171 --> 33:09.105
She's trying to work me, kid.
But, trust me, I can...

33:09.107 --> 33:12.008
Oh, sweet Mother of Arceus,
that feels so good.

33:12.010 --> 33:14.377
- So, listen...
- Oh, my God.

33:14.379 --> 33:15.477
What happened?

33:15.479 --> 33:17.313
I found something
in Harry's desk,

33:17.315 --> 33:19.515
nearly choked me to death,
and I was...

33:19.517 --> 33:20.518
No, not here.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.121
In my office.

33:25.123 --> 33:27.791
In her office?
We're going to her office?

33:29.995 --> 33:31.561
This is great.

33:31.563 --> 33:34.831
This isn't an office.
It's a coffin with pencils.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.233
Psyduck?

33:36.235 --> 33:37.467
Yeah, that's right.
I can talk to the kid,

33:37.469 --> 33:39.002
he can talk to me.
We're gifted.

33:39.004 --> 33:40.970
You didn't tell me
that she has a Psyduck.

33:40.972 --> 33:43.505
These things explode
when they're stressed.

33:43.507 --> 33:45.007
Hey. Hey, keep calm, pal.

33:45.009 --> 33:47.445
Serenity now. Serenity now.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.982
- No.
- Okay.

33:50.682 --> 33:51.781
Okay.

33:51.783 --> 33:53.552
- You got it?
- Here it is.

33:57.555 --> 33:58.755
Where did you find these?

33:58.757 --> 34:00.090
Word on the street was that

34:00.092 --> 34:01.858
Harry had an informant
near the docks.

34:01.860 --> 34:03.325
I went there to snoop around,

34:03.327 --> 34:05.495
and that's where
I found the vial.

34:05.497 --> 34:08.163
But the docks
can be dangerous.

34:08.165 --> 34:09.364
It's not the sort of place

34:09.366 --> 34:12.000
you want to visit alone
at night.

34:12.002 --> 34:14.405
I'm actually pretty good
at being alone at night.

34:15.908 --> 34:19.074
Nope, that did not land right
at all.

34:19.076 --> 34:22.978
That's not... That's not
what I meant to say. Um...

34:22.980 --> 34:24.913
- It's okay.
- I'm just gonna...

34:24.915 --> 34:26.482
We should go.

34:26.484 --> 34:28.752
- Yeah, we should go.
- I'm just gonna scoot by ya.

34:28.754 --> 34:31.353
Good God, have you ever talked
to a woman before?

34:31.355 --> 34:33.522
- You've got some...
- Psyduck.

34:33.524 --> 34:35.558
Yes, I've talked women before.
No, I don't need your help.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.860
Was it during
the birth canal, or...

34:42.667 --> 34:44.199
You know what you need?

34:44.201 --> 34:45.902
A shoulder saddle.
I bet someone makes one.

34:45.904 --> 34:47.703
Okay. There are other
ways for you to get around.

34:47.705 --> 34:49.306
This is humiliating.

34:49.308 --> 34:50.607
Every step
for you is 1000 for me,

34:50.609 --> 34:51.975
and my lungs
are the size of grapes.

34:51.976 --> 34:53.243
We need to get
some ground rules

34:53.245 --> 34:54.277
if this partnership's
gonna work.

34:54.279 --> 34:55.844
You're not my partner.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.080
Mentor, <i>sensei,</i> master,

34:57.081 --> 34:58.080
whatever you wanna call it.

34:58.082 --> 34:59.649
Nope, none of those.

34:59.651 --> 35:01.417
Hey, what if it wasn't the
gas? What if it's hereditary?

35:01.419 --> 35:03.786
What if Harry could understand
your annoying voice, too?

35:03.788 --> 35:06.156
You don't need to talk to us
for us to understand.

35:06.158 --> 35:07.924
We can feel
what you're saying.

35:07.926 --> 35:10.960
You have to be open to the
experience. Try it sometime.

35:10.962 --> 35:12.295
Yeah, I'd rather not.

35:12.297 --> 35:13.795
I got my plate full
talking to you.

35:14.899 --> 35:16.132
What is that?

35:16.134 --> 35:17.533
Silent but deadly.

35:17.535 --> 35:19.402
Apologies, my tummy's bad
from all the coffee.

35:19.404 --> 35:20.939
No. Ew. Get off.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.306
I meant that.

35:23.308 --> 35:25.375
Oh. Ooh. Ugh.

35:25.377 --> 35:26.442
That.

35:26.444 --> 35:29.245
It's a Mr. Mime.
They're the worst.

35:29.247 --> 35:32.315
Silent but annoying.

35:32.317 --> 35:34.850
Does he recognize you?
I think he recognizes you.

35:34.852 --> 35:37.721
Well, I was Harry's partner,
so I would've been with him.

35:38.989 --> 35:41.091
Harry's informant
is a Pokemon!

35:41.093 --> 35:42.294
Get him!

35:47.832 --> 35:50.466
- He's barely moving.
- Don't tell him that.

35:50.468 --> 35:51.969
Oh! He's on a bike.

35:51.971 --> 35:53.203
Come on! He thinks
he's getting away.

35:53.205 --> 35:54.538
Look, quick!
Get in front of him.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.505
- Cut him off. You can make it.
- Stop.

35:56.507 --> 35:59.241
Oh, no.

35:59.243 --> 36:01.611
He's going down hard, Tim.

36:01.613 --> 36:03.645
Should've worn a helmet.

36:03.647 --> 36:04.848
I hope he makes it.

36:04.850 --> 36:07.283
Come on. This is ridiculous.

36:07.285 --> 36:08.650
I'm good cop, you're bad cop.

36:08.652 --> 36:09.719
We're not cops.

36:09.721 --> 36:11.221
Grow some berries.

36:11.223 --> 36:12.321
You're bigger and tougher
looking than I am.

36:12.323 --> 36:13.890
Stand up straight!

36:13.892 --> 36:15.225
Listen up.

36:15.227 --> 36:16.826
We got ways to make you talk.
Or mime.

36:16.828 --> 36:18.361
Yeah.

36:18.363 --> 36:19.362
So tell us
what we wanna know.

36:19.364 --> 36:20.696
Why was Harry Goodman here

36:20.698 --> 36:22.533
and what did it have to do
with the R?

36:23.968 --> 36:26.002
Pipe. Yes, okay. A can!

36:26.004 --> 36:27.536
Shoving. Pushing.

36:27.538 --> 36:28.937
My problem is that
I push people away

36:28.939 --> 36:30.505
and then hate them
for leaving.

36:30.507 --> 36:32.542
- He's saying you can shove it.
- What? I can shove it?

36:32.544 --> 36:34.143
Okay, that's it.
We're switching roles.

36:34.145 --> 36:35.444
I'm bad cop, you're good cop.

36:35.446 --> 36:37.078
- No, no, no, we're not cops!
- Oh!

36:37.080 --> 36:38.614
Oh, God,
that's a very hard wall.

36:38.616 --> 36:40.283
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Mr. Mime has the ability

36:40.285 --> 36:42.451
to make invisible walls.

36:42.453 --> 36:45.120
Uh, yes, I know. I happen to
be a Pokemon, too, remember?

36:45.122 --> 36:48.757
Look, Harry figured this guy
out somehow.

36:48.759 --> 36:51.596
I think the trick is
getting inside his head.

36:52.864 --> 36:54.166
I have an idea.

36:55.899 --> 36:57.199
What are you doing?

36:58.402 --> 36:59.669
Oh, what's this?

36:59.671 --> 37:01.203
Oh, there's a door there.
I didn't...

37:01.205 --> 37:02.571
Probably because
it's invisible.

37:02.573 --> 37:05.341
Huh? Yeah! I'm in your space
now, am I right?

37:05.343 --> 37:07.643
You don't like this so much,
do you?

37:07.645 --> 37:09.578
What are you doing?

37:09.580 --> 37:11.781
That's a jug.
No, you're pouring.

37:11.783 --> 37:13.116
No.

37:13.118 --> 37:14.484
Salt. It's a salt shaker.
You're cooking.

37:14.486 --> 37:15.786
- No.
- Real cooking is about

37:15.788 --> 37:17.020
following your heart,
not a recipe!

37:17.022 --> 37:18.420
What are you talking about?

37:18.422 --> 37:20.623
Gas. You're pouring
gasoline on...

37:20.625 --> 37:23.458
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, that went dark fast.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.862
I like this.
I like this very much.

37:27.732 --> 37:29.065
All right, all right.

37:30.701 --> 37:32.467
Okay. You wanna
play that game?

37:32.469 --> 37:34.203
I can play that game.

37:36.475 --> 37:38.408
You think that's funny?

37:38.410 --> 37:40.243
You think that's funny, huh?

37:40.245 --> 37:43.279
You're not gonna be
laughing soon, huh?

37:43.281 --> 37:45.714
Who's laughing now, huh?

37:45.716 --> 37:48.851
Oh. Oh, I smell what
you're stepping in.

37:48.853 --> 37:50.187
That's right, Mr. Mime.

37:50.189 --> 37:52.321
You're about to be Mr. Melt

37:52.323 --> 37:53.859
unless you start talking.

37:55.292 --> 37:57.460
Cards, cards. Playing cards.
Poker.

37:57.462 --> 37:59.027
No, I think he's talking
about the R.

37:59.029 --> 38:00.996
Someone was handing out R.

38:00.998 --> 38:02.732
Use your body words. Where?

38:02.734 --> 38:05.033
Circle house. Moon house.
Moon. House.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.937
Enough with the games.
Say it.

38:06.939 --> 38:08.069
Just say it!

38:08.071 --> 38:09.806
Talk, you stupid mime!

38:09.808 --> 38:11.643
Okay, just relax.

38:12.143 --> 38:13.777
Uh, round.

38:13.779 --> 38:14.978
Round house. Uh...

38:14.980 --> 38:17.147
The source of the R
came from the Roundhouse.

38:17.149 --> 38:18.415
Yeah, nice work, kid.
Maybe there's

38:18.417 --> 38:20.348
a little detective
in you after all.

38:37.069 --> 38:41.573
Critical hit!
Additional damage!

38:53.584 --> 38:56.185
I didn't know they had
Pokemon battles in Ryme City.

38:56.187 --> 38:57.422
We're not supposed to.

38:59.823 --> 39:02.225
Gengar uses Shadow Ball!

39:13.337 --> 39:15.174
Come on.
Let's take a look around.

39:20.511 --> 39:22.612
Okay, kid.
So here's what we know.

39:22.614 --> 39:24.681
Harry traces the R to here.

39:24.683 --> 39:26.116
Then frequents this joint
because someone

39:26.118 --> 39:27.650
here knows something
about something.

39:27.652 --> 39:30.652
We just need to find
the someone and the something.

39:30.654 --> 39:35.225
Hey, hey! Where's that
Pikachu's partner? Don't go.

39:35.227 --> 39:37.292
I think the "someone"
just found us.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.661
Wow. I'd like to see

39:38.663 --> 39:40.062
this guy's Internet
search history.

39:40.064 --> 39:41.297
Who are you?

39:41.299 --> 39:42.431
Let's see where this goes.

39:42.433 --> 39:43.665
Tell him
you're my new partner.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.667
I'm his new partner.

39:45.669 --> 39:47.670
Well, that Pikachu's
Thunderbolt

39:47.672 --> 39:49.839
almost wrecked
my prize Charizard

39:49.841 --> 39:52.277
- last time he was here.
- Oh.

39:53.111 --> 39:54.676
Scar is still fresh.

39:54.678 --> 39:58.348
All I hear are consonants,
and all I see are nipples.

39:58.350 --> 40:00.415
And you know what?

40:00.417 --> 40:02.884
He ruined my coat, man.
Look at this.

40:02.886 --> 40:03.886
I'm so sorry.

40:03.888 --> 40:05.654
Forget the coat.
Where's his shirt?

40:05.656 --> 40:08.558
This! This is my place!

40:08.560 --> 40:11.226
And nobody comes into my place

40:11.228 --> 40:13.328
and does that to my Pokemon.

40:13.330 --> 40:14.730
What are you looking at?

40:14.732 --> 40:16.364
Or to my coat.

40:16.366 --> 40:18.266
Right, the coat. The coat.

40:18.268 --> 40:19.734
What are you doing?

40:19.736 --> 40:21.571
Classic staredown, kid.
First one to blink loses.

40:21.573 --> 40:22.705
Now stop distracting me.

40:22.707 --> 40:24.873
Er, look, I just wanna know

40:24.875 --> 40:26.708
why his old partner was here.
That's all.

40:26.710 --> 40:28.310
Gengar wins.

40:29.614 --> 40:32.348
Ready for next battle.

40:32.350 --> 40:34.083
And I want a rematch.

40:34.085 --> 40:36.351
You give me my rematch...

40:37.888 --> 40:40.392
I'll tell you everything
you want to know. What I know.

40:41.893 --> 40:43.962
- Er...
- Tell him he's on, <i>amigo.</i>

40:44.895 --> 40:45.960
Okay.

40:45.962 --> 40:48.096
A new battle's unfolding.

40:48.098 --> 40:51.199
Pikachu versus Charizard.

40:51.201 --> 40:52.469
Rematch!

40:56.207 --> 40:58.341
Here. Hold my hat.

40:58.343 --> 40:59.808
I'm about to rock this place.

40:59.810 --> 41:01.844
- Okay.
- Charizard! Charizard!

41:01.846 --> 41:03.578
Just doing
some light stretching.

41:03.580 --> 41:05.246
You never wanna
go into these things tight.

41:05.248 --> 41:07.183
You're gonna win
this time, okay?

41:07.185 --> 41:09.719
What are you doing?
What is your plan of attack?

41:09.721 --> 41:11.554
I don't operate
according to plans, kid.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.955
I deal with things
in the moment.

41:15.493 --> 41:19.531
Here. Here we go.
Now you'll be ready.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.034
Now, obviously, I've dealt
with this putz before,

41:26.036 --> 41:27.335
so I'll just do it again.

41:28.605 --> 41:30.138
Give me my hat back!

41:30.140 --> 41:31.341
That thing just chugged

41:31.343 --> 41:33.009
a year's worth
of that R stuff!

41:33.011 --> 41:35.444
Hey, hey, hey.
It's like you said, okay?

41:35.446 --> 41:36.578
You did it before.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.114
You just gotta
use your powers.

41:38.116 --> 41:41.083
You can use Quick Attack,
Discharge, or Electro Ball,

41:41.085 --> 41:42.551
but I think Volt Tackle

41:42.553 --> 41:44.053
is your best move,
so start with that.

41:44.055 --> 41:45.520
First of all,

41:45.522 --> 41:46.922
when did you learn
how to be a Pokemon Trainer?

41:46.924 --> 41:48.991
And secondly, get me
the hell out of here!

41:48.993 --> 41:49.995
Begin!

41:52.363 --> 41:53.830
- Look out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:53.832 --> 41:55.531
I forgot everything you said!

41:55.533 --> 41:57.600
I forget things, it's what
I do! I have amnesia!

41:57.602 --> 41:59.801
You need to go for a
critical hit. Use Volt Tackle!

41:59.803 --> 42:02.871
Volt Tackle will knock me out.
I'm going for Thunderbolt.

42:03.908 --> 42:06.275
Come on.
You got it, you got it!

42:14.951 --> 42:16.786
Come on, come on, come on.

42:16.788 --> 42:18.721
Hey, bud! What are you doing?

42:18.723 --> 42:20.790
I can't do it
when people are watching.

42:20.792 --> 42:22.859
Can everyone just
look away, please?

42:22.861 --> 42:25.194
It's not working.

42:25.196 --> 42:26.929
I forgot how to use my powers.

42:29.466 --> 42:30.669
But he didn't!

42:35.372 --> 42:36.538
Pikachu, run!

42:36.540 --> 42:38.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:45.517 --> 42:47.350
Taken out with one hit!

42:47.352 --> 42:49.317
Aw, Pikachu. Wanna cry?

42:53.690 --> 42:56.591
You don't wanna do this!
I'm adorable.

42:56.593 --> 42:58.162
Pika-Pika?

43:07.939 --> 43:10.408
Are you crazy?
Get out of there!

43:12.509 --> 43:13.643
I got it, kid!

43:24.221 --> 43:26.388
What are you doing to my baby?

43:26.390 --> 43:28.357
- Get out of the way!
- Uh-oh.

43:36.201 --> 43:38.634
Uh-oh. That's not good.

44:13.671 --> 44:15.036
Tell me what you know!

44:15.038 --> 44:16.873
The guy you are looking for

44:16.875 --> 44:19.641
wanted to know
the source of R.

44:19.643 --> 44:21.444
It comes from the doctor.

44:21.446 --> 44:22.511
That's all I know.

44:22.513 --> 44:23.748
Now let me go!

44:38.161 --> 44:39.997
Nice catch, kid.
Let's get out of here.

44:45.035 --> 44:46.368
I got a plan.

44:46.370 --> 44:48.536
What? That's not gonna work.
Magikarp is the worst.

44:48.538 --> 44:50.438
Magikarp can evolve
into Gyarados.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.574
All it needs is a little kick.

44:51.576 --> 44:52.844
Water in the hole!

44:56.214 --> 44:58.013
In my head,
I saw that differently.

44:58.015 --> 45:00.618
Er...

45:14.564 --> 45:16.600
Hey, Tim? I don't float.

45:23.875 --> 45:26.911
Ha! I told you
Magikarp weren't useless.

45:28.578 --> 45:30.582
You're under arrest.

45:31.982 --> 45:34.817
I thought you couldn't wait
to get home.

45:34.819 --> 45:37.922
Yeah. Well, my plans changed
because I found him.

45:38.589 --> 45:40.022
I'm not following.

45:40.024 --> 45:42.591
Harry's not dead.
If his Pokemon partner

45:42.593 --> 45:43.759
is still alive,
that means he is, too.

45:43.761 --> 45:45.428
That is not proof, son.

45:45.430 --> 45:46.562
Tell him about the chemical R.

45:46.564 --> 45:47.629
Give me a minute.

45:47.631 --> 45:48.998
Harry's last case

45:49.000 --> 45:50.433
had to do with those
underground battles.

45:50.435 --> 45:51.634
That's why I was there.
There's a chemical.

45:51.636 --> 45:53.002
We ran an investigation.

45:53.004 --> 45:54.536
Harry figured it out
and he's in trouble.

45:54.538 --> 45:55.737
That case is closed. Over!

45:55.739 --> 45:56.806
You gotta reopen
the investigation!

45:56.808 --> 45:58.140
He's out there, I can feel it.

45:58.142 --> 45:59.408
In your jellies.
Go ahead, say it.

45:59.410 --> 46:00.743
I'm not gonna say that.

46:00.745 --> 46:02.879
I can feel it, Lieutenant,
in my bones.

46:02.881 --> 46:04.946
- Not as good.
- Stop!

46:04.948 --> 46:07.516
Oh, yeah, and I can
understand Pikachu,

46:07.518 --> 46:09.621
like, word perfect, so...

46:11.221 --> 46:12.922
Tim.

46:12.924 --> 46:15.458
It's very difficult
coping with loss.

46:15.460 --> 46:16.891
Denial can be
a powerful thing.

46:16.893 --> 46:19.527
No, I'm not in denial!
I'm right, I know it!

46:19.529 --> 46:21.765
He's... He's out there.

46:27.672 --> 46:29.938
I never wanted
to show you this,

46:29.940 --> 46:32.710
but I think
it's important you see it.

46:40.250 --> 46:43.652
No one could survive
a crash like that.

46:43.654 --> 46:45.390
Not even your dad.

46:48.359 --> 46:50.828
He's gone, Tim.

47:01.839 --> 47:04.075
I should've
gotten on that train.

47:06.910 --> 47:08.646
What's that, kid?

47:11.415 --> 47:13.250
After my mom died,

47:14.451 --> 47:16.419
my dad and I drifted apart.

47:16.421 --> 47:17.819
Er...

47:17.821 --> 47:21.692
He moved here and poured
himself into his work.

47:23.660 --> 47:25.326
And, eventually,
he tried to get me

47:25.328 --> 47:26.997
to come live with him,

47:27.799 --> 47:29.234
but I wouldn't go.

47:30.768 --> 47:32.203
How come?

47:36.774 --> 47:38.743
I didn't think he cared.

47:41.145 --> 47:47.181
I guess I just got used to him
not being around

47:47.183 --> 47:50.321
and I couldn't forgive him
for it.

47:51.888 --> 47:53.825
Until I got here.

47:57.562 --> 47:59.764
And I realized
that he did care.

48:01.899 --> 48:04.933
But I didn't know...

48:06.236 --> 48:09.139
because I never
gave him the chance.

48:10.341 --> 48:13.344
And now it's too late.

48:17.580 --> 48:19.383
I really...

48:21.819 --> 48:24.455
I really wish
I'd gotten on that train.

48:26.857 --> 48:28.292
Mmm-hmm.

48:31.562 --> 48:33.030
Listen, kid.

48:33.832 --> 48:35.263
Um...

48:35.265 --> 48:38.132
Look, I may not have memories,

48:38.134 --> 48:40.839
um, but I know this much:

48:42.573 --> 48:44.075
It wasn't your fault.

48:46.843 --> 48:49.012
It wasn't anybody's fault.

48:51.315 --> 48:54.118
And I'm sure that
if your dad was here,

48:55.852 --> 48:58.053
he would hug you so hard,

48:58.055 --> 48:59.991
your bones would pop.

49:00.790 --> 49:01.857
And he'd tell you

49:01.859 --> 49:03.862
he's sorry for everything.

49:06.263 --> 49:08.932
He'd be
damn proud of you, kid.

49:12.937 --> 49:15.069
I haven't been
really nice to you.

49:15.071 --> 49:17.205
No, you really haven't.

49:21.279 --> 49:22.347
Well...

49:23.513 --> 49:25.580
We still got
one mystery to solve.

49:25.582 --> 49:26.882
What?

49:26.884 --> 49:28.185
Yours.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.554
Let's find out
who did this to you.

49:32.556 --> 49:33.888
Get your memory back.

49:33.890 --> 49:35.392
I'd like that.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.125
I'd like that very much.

49:42.165 --> 49:43.968
Well, that's a bad-guy car.

50:02.819 --> 50:04.252
Thank you, Miss Norman.

50:04.254 --> 50:07.455
Yes. Thank you, Miss Norman.
That'll be all.

50:07.457 --> 50:08.959
What a blabbermouth.

50:09.660 --> 50:11.995
Please, come in.

50:16.433 --> 50:18.768
Magnificent creatures,
aren't they?

50:25.843 --> 50:28.446
Whoa. A Flareon.

50:30.080 --> 50:33.049
Imagine
being able to evolve

50:33.051 --> 50:35.884
into the best possible
version of yourself.

50:35.886 --> 50:38.120
Hmm. 'Sup?

50:38.122 --> 50:42.594
That greatness inside you,
just waiting to be awoken.

50:46.096 --> 50:47.429
Hello, Tim.

50:47.431 --> 50:48.696
He knows you?

50:48.698 --> 50:51.632
I see you've partnered
with Harry's Pikachu.

50:51.634 --> 50:52.967
And he knows me, too.

50:52.969 --> 50:54.870
You knew Harry?

50:54.872 --> 50:57.241
The case Harry was working on,

50:57.808 --> 50:59.107
it was for me.

50:59.109 --> 51:01.475
That's a twist.
That's very twisty.

51:01.477 --> 51:05.614
This compound threatens
everything I've built.

51:05.616 --> 51:08.083
He knows about the R.
How does he know about the R?

51:08.085 --> 51:10.886
I hired Harry
to trace it to its source.

51:10.888 --> 51:13.888
Imagine my shock
when the answer

51:13.890 --> 51:16.293
turned out to be my own son.

51:18.129 --> 51:21.096
I've devoted my life
to perfecting the partnership

51:21.098 --> 51:22.763
between Pokemon and humans.

51:22.765 --> 51:26.301
A partnership where Pokemon
bring out the best in us.

51:26.303 --> 51:28.571
In doing so,
I'm afraid I neglected

51:28.573 --> 51:31.142
my responsibilities
as a parent.

51:33.877 --> 51:36.210
Roger resents the Pokemon.

51:36.212 --> 51:39.382
I think he's lived in
my shadow for so long,

51:39.384 --> 51:42.685
he actually wants
to destroy my legacy.

51:42.687 --> 51:43.884
Well, there's no such thing

51:43.886 --> 51:45.386
as "daddy issues"
without "daddy".

51:45.388 --> 51:47.755
But, Mr. Clifford,
how could you let him do that?

51:47.757 --> 51:50.658
Ever since my illness
put me in this chair,

51:50.660 --> 51:53.862
Roger has taken over more
and more of the company.

51:53.864 --> 51:55.364
He controls the board.

51:55.366 --> 51:58.065
He also controls the police
and the politicians.

51:58.067 --> 52:00.167
And he owns the press.

52:00.169 --> 52:03.304
Harry is the only one
I can trust.

52:03.306 --> 52:06.209
That's why
you need to find him.

52:06.843 --> 52:08.576
You haven't heard.

52:08.578 --> 52:10.112
Harry's dead.

52:10.114 --> 52:11.616
Oh, no, Tim.

52:12.817 --> 52:14.616
Your father

52:14.618 --> 52:16.086
is alive.

52:19.223 --> 52:20.625
Look out, kid!

52:24.928 --> 52:27.395
Advanced holographic imaging.

52:27.397 --> 52:29.698
Since being confined
to this chair,

52:29.700 --> 52:35.036
I've invested in ways
of bringing the world to me.

52:35.038 --> 52:37.339
This was recreated
from police footage.

52:37.341 --> 52:40.174
It allows us to see things
that they cannot

52:40.176 --> 52:42.579
or don't want us to see.

52:44.681 --> 52:46.017
He's alive.

52:46.551 --> 52:47.683
Pika.

52:47.685 --> 52:49.750
It's me. I was with Harry
in the crash.

52:49.752 --> 52:50.754
He needs my help.

52:53.991 --> 52:56.060
If Harry's alive,
why didn't they find him?

53:03.801 --> 53:04.933
What is that?

53:04.935 --> 53:06.201
Mewtwo.

53:06.203 --> 53:08.569
A man-made abomination

53:08.571 --> 53:10.906
created in a laboratory
using DNA

53:10.908 --> 53:14.109
from the fossil remains
of the Ancient Mew.

53:14.111 --> 53:15.745
I can't believe it.

53:15.747 --> 53:17.846
If that thing came from Mew,

53:17.848 --> 53:19.147
then we're looking at

53:19.149 --> 53:21.151
the most powerful Pokemon
in the world.

53:27.056 --> 53:29.991
That's it.
That's what happened to me.

53:29.993 --> 53:32.893
Mewtwo wiped my memory.

53:32.895 --> 53:34.098
But why?

53:39.102 --> 53:40.537
Wait, wait, wait!

53:46.576 --> 53:50.112
Wait. Wait, wait.
Where did it take him?

53:50.114 --> 53:52.480
That's for you to solve now.

53:52.482 --> 53:56.687
Find Mewtwo
and you will find your father.

54:00.723 --> 54:01.823
Second chances

54:01.825 --> 54:03.391
are special things, kid.

54:03.393 --> 54:05.326
There's a lot we can make
better if we crack this case.

54:05.328 --> 54:07.196
One question, though.
Where are we going?

54:07.198 --> 54:08.596
I don't know, I'm just going.

54:08.598 --> 54:10.531
You gotta tell me where.
You're the detective.

54:10.533 --> 54:13.601
Okay. If Roger Clifford is
the key to all of this...

54:13.603 --> 54:16.471
Then we need someone
who has access to him.

54:16.473 --> 54:19.107
And we both know who that is,
lover boy.

54:19.109 --> 54:20.509
Okay, come on, that's...

54:20.511 --> 54:22.447
Come on.
Let's not start that again.

54:29.252 --> 54:30.685
There she is.

54:30.687 --> 54:33.422
What's with the sunglasses?
Can she see us?

54:33.424 --> 54:35.022
I don't think she can see us.

54:35.024 --> 54:38.095
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Don't talk to me.

54:39.029 --> 54:40.795
Okay.

54:40.797 --> 54:43.832
- What happens now?
- Just act casual.

54:43.834 --> 54:46.301
But don't look at me.

54:46.303 --> 54:48.672
There's nothing really casual
about this.

54:49.306 --> 54:50.541
Look at this.

54:52.109 --> 54:53.607
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry. That was my fault.

54:53.609 --> 54:55.277
- Ow!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

54:55.279 --> 54:56.612
Oh, this is working out great.

54:56.614 --> 54:57.980
Why don't you just
have her sit over here.

54:57.982 --> 54:59.281
You wanna just
come sit with us?

54:59.283 --> 55:00.181
I should never have
encouraged you.

55:00.183 --> 55:01.417
You have no chance.

55:01.419 --> 55:02.585
I got access
to Roger's computer.

55:02.587 --> 55:04.053
Oh, wow, how'd you do that?

55:04.055 --> 55:05.487
Spilled a cappuccino
on his lap.

55:05.489 --> 55:06.687
Eh, that sounds like
a waste of coffee.

55:06.689 --> 55:08.323
I searched through
all his records.

55:08.325 --> 55:09.757
I targeted the property rights
in the region

55:09.759 --> 55:11.493
and I cross-checked that
with city records

55:11.495 --> 55:14.163
for any Clifford-financed
businesses until I found it.

55:14.165 --> 55:16.698
May I present PCL:

55:16.700 --> 55:19.100
A Pokemon genetic
research facility.

55:19.102 --> 55:20.234
But that's not all.

55:20.236 --> 55:21.402
She's good.

55:21.404 --> 55:23.571
Last week,
PCL had an "accident"

55:23.573 --> 55:25.107
and had to shut down
their entire facility.

55:25.109 --> 55:28.176
That's the same night
Harry Goodman went missing.

55:28.178 --> 55:29.944
No one knows what happened.

55:29.946 --> 55:32.212
Total media blackout.

55:32.214 --> 55:33.681
What does it all mean?

55:33.683 --> 55:35.449
I don't know.
This is very exciting.

55:35.451 --> 55:36.984
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

55:36.986 --> 55:38.754
I think he just peed a little.

55:38.756 --> 55:41.123
Oh, nope. That's me.
That was me.

55:41.125 --> 55:44.259
So, um, there's a cover-up?

55:44.261 --> 55:45.529
Mmm-hmm.

55:46.495 --> 55:48.665
But, er,
what are they covering up?

55:50.134 --> 55:52.270
What do you say
we go find out?

56:08.984 --> 56:10.351
So let me get this right.

56:10.353 --> 56:12.487
We're forced to listen
to this spa music

56:12.489 --> 56:15.156
so your head doesn't explode
and kill us all.

56:15.158 --> 56:16.591
Psyduck.

56:16.593 --> 56:19.230
Your Pikachu
is so unusual.

56:19.730 --> 56:21.129
Psyduck.

56:21.131 --> 56:23.698
Hey, you put that down.
I am not giving you a massage.

56:23.700 --> 56:24.900
Psyduck.

56:24.902 --> 56:27.368
I have never known a Pokemon
to wear a hat.

56:27.370 --> 56:29.004
Yeah, he's weird.
He's so weird.

56:29.006 --> 56:30.239
Psyduck.

56:30.241 --> 56:31.839
Of course I care
about my partner's life.

56:31.841 --> 56:33.241
Fine, fine. Hand it over.

56:34.310 --> 56:35.877
What are you doing?

56:35.879 --> 56:37.344
What?

56:37.346 --> 56:38.612
Nothing.

56:38.614 --> 56:41.384
I was actually wondering
who this was.

56:42.719 --> 56:46.087
It's PCL's chief scientist,
Dr. Anne Laurent.

56:46.089 --> 56:48.223
I bet this is the doctor
Shirtless was talking about.

56:48.225 --> 56:49.457
She lost
her university grant

56:49.459 --> 56:50.859
over experimentation
of Pokemon

56:50.861 --> 56:52.893
because she was trying to
control their minds.

56:52.895 --> 56:54.062
Oh, wow.

56:54.064 --> 56:56.397
She's essentially
a neurologist for Pokemon.

56:56.399 --> 56:57.732
Maybe she could weigh in

56:57.734 --> 56:59.134
on the long-term
psychological effects

56:59.136 --> 57:01.203
of being strapped
into a baby seat

57:01.205 --> 57:03.274
- next to a bomb.
- Hmm?

57:07.210 --> 57:08.712
This is it.

57:11.549 --> 57:12.917
Look at the signs.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.817
Must have been
a really bad accident.

57:16.819 --> 57:18.620
That's
what they want you to believe.

57:18.622 --> 57:20.621
Whoever staged this
did an excellent job.

57:20.623 --> 57:22.623
Those signs are the perfect
scarecrow for suckers.

57:22.625 --> 57:24.525
Yeah, well,
they're working on me.

57:24.527 --> 57:26.960
Kid, this dame's
looking for danger.

57:26.962 --> 57:28.230
You want to win her over,

57:28.232 --> 57:29.763
you gotta lead her
straight to it.

57:29.765 --> 57:32.368
First of all, women don't like
to be called "dame".

57:32.370 --> 57:36.437
Second, women appreciate calm,
er, level-headed

57:36.439 --> 57:39.141
and responsible
decision-making.

57:39.143 --> 57:41.579
What is she doing? Hey, hey!

57:42.212 --> 57:43.511
Hey!

57:43.513 --> 57:45.714
Lucy, what are you doing?

57:45.716 --> 57:49.283
I'm, er, I'm cutting the fence
so that we can slip through.

57:49.285 --> 57:50.551
Where did you get those?

57:50.553 --> 57:51.853
Oh,
don't worry about it.

57:51.855 --> 57:53.587
After you, sir.

57:53.589 --> 57:54.855
- Psyduck.
- No? Okay.

57:54.857 --> 57:56.024
I'll go first.
Whatever's most calming.

57:56.026 --> 57:57.328
Hmm, Psyduck.

58:14.310 --> 58:15.710
Okay.

58:16.814 --> 58:19.616
Psyduck. Psyduck.

58:24.221 --> 58:25.423
Oh.

58:26.522 --> 58:28.992
It's okay.
You can stay up there.

58:36.399 --> 58:39.134
I may have
amnesia, but I'm pretty sure

58:39.136 --> 58:41.739
this is the worst idea
anyone's ever had.

58:44.540 --> 58:46.076
What is that?

58:47.444 --> 58:48.879
I'm not sure.

58:51.580 --> 58:54.248
Psyduck. Psyduck.

58:56.051 --> 58:57.752
It's Greninja.

58:57.754 --> 58:59.853
But they don't look right.

58:59.855 --> 59:01.723
"Test 22."

59:01.725 --> 59:03.594
"Power enhancement"?

59:05.395 --> 59:07.228
They were experimenting
on them.

59:07.230 --> 59:08.462
But why?

59:08.464 --> 59:09.931
If Roger Clifford's
behind this,

59:09.933 --> 59:12.670
what's he doing
experimenting on Pokemon?

59:20.044 --> 59:22.009
A Torterra garden.

59:27.817 --> 59:30.018
"Pokemon
evolution test 33.

59:30.020 --> 59:31.886
"Growth enhancement."

59:31.888 --> 59:34.656
They look normal-sized to me.

59:34.658 --> 59:37.391
Maybe it hasn't started yet.

59:37.393 --> 59:42.263
It's like they're trying to
manipulate Pokemon evolution.

59:42.265 --> 59:44.531
Is that even possible?

59:44.533 --> 59:46.600
I don't know.

59:46.602 --> 59:49.506
I need to document
all of this, though.

59:54.645 --> 59:56.178
<i>You go ahead.
I'll catch up to you.</i>

59:56.180 --> 59:57.848
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah.</i>

01:00:14.163 --> 01:00:15.165
Whoa.

01:00:17.033 --> 01:00:18.567
What happened here?

01:00:18.569 --> 01:00:20.301
Bad stuff.

01:00:20.303 --> 01:00:22.837
Really bad stuff.

01:00:22.839 --> 01:00:25.306
Still think
this was staged?

01:00:31.781 --> 01:00:35.350
Kid, hey! Over here.

01:00:35.352 --> 01:00:38.252
It says Dr. Laurent's station.

01:00:38.254 --> 01:00:40.190
Looks like it's still working.

01:00:49.132 --> 01:00:51.734
<i>Remote access initiated.</i>

01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:00.143
Psyduck!

01:01:06.015 --> 01:01:08.017
Looks like most of the files
are corrupted.

01:01:09.953 --> 01:01:12.989
Uh-oh. Another one
of those holograms.

01:01:24.167 --> 01:01:25.933
Day 42.

01:01:25.935 --> 01:01:27.835
After much trial and error

01:01:27.837 --> 01:01:29.804
we perfected a stable method

01:01:29.806 --> 01:01:33.406
to extract Mewtwo's DNA.

01:01:33.408 --> 01:01:35.609
It's Mewtwo. No, wait.

01:01:35.611 --> 01:01:37.914
Wait, Mewtwo came
from this place?

01:01:39.283 --> 01:01:44.152
Day 60. Clinical trials
proven successful.

01:01:44.154 --> 01:01:47.087
The inhalant
results in confusion

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:50.225
and the total loss
of free will.

01:01:50.227 --> 01:01:54.596
Which, in turn,
makes the Pokemon go wild.

01:01:54.598 --> 01:01:59.036
We've designated
this chemical as serum R.

01:02:01.038 --> 01:02:02.737
They used Mewtwo to make R.

01:02:02.739 --> 01:02:05.942
And they were testing it
at the battles.

01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:11.812
Day 68.

01:02:11.814 --> 01:02:14.248
The neural link
is operational.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.616
<i>Alert.</i>

01:02:15.618 --> 01:02:17.988
- <i>Condition: Red.</i>
- Oh.

01:02:20.622 --> 01:02:22.257
No. No, no, no!

01:02:22.259 --> 01:02:24.225
We're losing power
in the containment...

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.406
That must've been
how Mewtwo escaped.

01:02:38.408 --> 01:02:39.741
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:02:39.743 --> 01:02:41.643
What did that thing
want with Harry?

01:02:41.645 --> 01:02:43.011
Good question, kid.

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:45.647
I'll try and take us back
to the beginning.

01:02:51.488 --> 01:02:54.922
Day 1.
The lab is almost fully operational.

01:02:54.924 --> 01:02:56.857
All that remains now
is to capture

01:02:56.859 --> 01:03:00.127
the most powerful Pokemon
known to mankind:

01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:02.163
Mewtwo.

01:03:02.165 --> 01:03:06.067
It escaped nearly 20 years ago
from the Kanto region.

01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:07.636
Fortunately, our benefactor's

01:03:07.638 --> 01:03:09.770
hired a specialist
to track it down.

01:03:09.772 --> 01:03:11.341
Good luck, Detective Goodman.

01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:20.582
That's why Mewtwo took Harry.

01:03:20.584 --> 01:03:22.683
It was revenge
for being captured.

01:03:22.685 --> 01:03:24.051
This doesn't make any sense.

01:03:24.053 --> 01:03:25.654
Harry would've
never been a part of this.

01:03:25.656 --> 01:03:27.422
I wanna believe that, kid.
But we gotta be honest here.

01:03:27.424 --> 01:03:29.656
You haven't seen him in years,
and I got amnesia.

01:03:29.658 --> 01:03:30.859
Neither of us can say for sure

01:03:30.861 --> 01:03:32.294
what Harry would
or wouldn't do.

01:03:32.296 --> 01:03:33.862
We gotta
get back to the city.

01:03:33.864 --> 01:03:36.967
Lucy. Lucy,
we gotta get back to...

01:03:41.372 --> 01:03:42.739
Lucy?

01:03:44.507 --> 01:03:45.739
Lucy?

01:03:53.216 --> 01:03:55.752
That was not there
before, kid.

01:03:58.555 --> 01:03:59.957
Ew.

01:04:07.263 --> 01:04:09.129
Look behind you.

01:04:09.131 --> 01:04:11.399
Whoa!

01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:12.736
Kid, the fire alarm!

01:04:17.241 --> 01:04:18.406
Psyduck!

01:04:18.408 --> 01:04:20.128
Come on! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.913
- Psyduck!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go back.

01:04:24.915 --> 01:04:27.151
Psyduck!

01:04:29.518 --> 01:04:30.721
Psyduck!

01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:34.925
Psyduck!

01:04:36.259 --> 01:04:37.625
Get down!

01:04:37.627 --> 01:04:40.096
Psyduck!

01:04:41.497 --> 01:04:42.899
Come on!

01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:46.333
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

01:04:46.335 --> 01:04:48.435
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

01:04:48.437 --> 01:04:50.904
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

01:04:50.906 --> 01:04:52.473
Duck! Duck! Duck!

01:04:55.277 --> 01:04:57.448
Psyduck! Psyduck!
Psyduck! Psyduck!

01:04:59.415 --> 01:05:01.549
- Psyduck!
- It's okay, Psyduck.

01:05:01.551 --> 01:05:02.750
Everything's fine.

01:05:02.752 --> 01:05:04.118
He's gonna
blow his stack, kid.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.422
It's okay, Psyduck, it's okay.
Calm down.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.992
Psyduck!

01:05:11.895 --> 01:05:12.893
This is no time

01:05:12.895 --> 01:05:14.495
for your stupid headaches.

01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:17.198
No, wait, this is the perfect
time to get a headache.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.366
- Psyduck?
- I hated rubbing your feet.

01:05:19.368 --> 01:05:21.101
Calm down, calm down!

01:05:21.103 --> 01:05:23.004
I'll never forgive my hands
for what they did.

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:25.973
Get a splitting headache now,
you neurotic duck!

01:05:25.975 --> 01:05:28.942
Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:05:37.853 --> 01:05:39.821
Psyduck.

01:05:39.823 --> 01:05:42.524
Good job, Psyduck.
Where's my hat?

01:05:48.397 --> 01:05:49.466
Something's wrong.

01:06:06.181 --> 01:06:08.683
Is this really happening?

01:06:08.685 --> 01:06:10.250
Don't worry.

01:06:10.252 --> 01:06:13.053
Psyduck's psionic waves
are causing hallucinations.

01:06:13.055 --> 01:06:14.422
None of this is real.

01:06:14.424 --> 01:06:15.855
Nope.

01:06:15.857 --> 01:06:17.924
All of this is real! Run!

01:06:17.926 --> 01:06:19.462
Go, go, go!

01:06:27.469 --> 01:06:30.504
- What's happening?
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:06:32.475 --> 01:06:34.107
At this point,

01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:37.346
how could you not
believe in climate change?

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.359
Oh no, no, no!

01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:53.363
I got you.

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:55.933
Tim!

01:06:58.401 --> 01:07:00.402
Go! Run! Run!

01:07:00.404 --> 01:07:02.272
Go, go, go, go!

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.875
Go, go, go!

01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:10.380
Okay.

01:07:19.221 --> 01:07:20.855
We made it.

01:07:21.924 --> 01:07:24.060
I officially hate this forest.

01:07:32.768 --> 01:07:33.971
Tim!

01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:35.937
Lucy!

01:07:35.939 --> 01:07:37.174
Tim!

01:07:37.707 --> 01:07:38.909
Psyduck!

01:07:48.183 --> 01:07:50.250
Kid, the walls are closing in.

01:07:50.252 --> 01:07:52.953
We have to do something
and we gotta do it fast.

01:07:52.955 --> 01:07:54.623
I gotta jump for it.

01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:57.125
That's a great fifth option.
Let's work on the first four.

01:07:57.127 --> 01:07:59.292
- You're not gonna make it!
- There's no other choice.

01:07:59.294 --> 01:08:00.761
We have a lot of choices.

01:08:00.763 --> 01:08:02.603
Falling to our death
is not one of...

01:08:09.506 --> 01:08:11.471
Tim!

01:08:11.473 --> 01:08:13.774
Pull, pull, pull!

01:08:13.776 --> 01:08:15.044
Come on!

01:08:18.412 --> 01:08:21.048
I thought I was gonna...
I thought I was gonna...

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:24.017
I... I...

01:08:24.019 --> 01:08:25.218
Eyeball.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.357
Eyeball. Eyeball!

01:08:39.535 --> 01:08:42.404
Oh! I get it!

01:08:42.406 --> 01:08:46.006
I get it now.
This isn't a forest at all.

01:08:46.009 --> 01:08:49.613
This is the Torterra garden.

01:08:58.054 --> 01:08:59.185
Pikachu!

01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:27.084
Psyduck.

01:09:29.852 --> 01:09:32.185
He's hurt.

01:09:33.723 --> 01:09:36.024
- Is he okay?
- I'm in bad shape, kid.

01:09:36.026 --> 01:09:37.892
I'm here, partner. I'm here.

01:09:39.129 --> 01:09:41.995
Did you just call me partner?

01:09:41.997 --> 01:09:43.731
Yeah, of course.
You're my partner.

01:09:43.733 --> 01:09:46.303
Yeah, that's right.
You've, er...

01:09:47.636 --> 01:09:49.970
You've got my back.

01:09:49.973 --> 01:09:52.005
Hey, hey, hey. Bud.

01:09:52.006 --> 01:09:55.711
Hey! Hey, Pikachu!

01:09:57.112 --> 01:09:58.614
Pikachu!

01:09:59.514 --> 01:10:00.616
No.

01:10:07.023 --> 01:10:09.656
Hey! Hey, help!

01:10:09.658 --> 01:10:11.159
Please!

01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:12.562
Please.

01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:14.631
He's hurt.

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:16.731
Please.

01:10:19.635 --> 01:10:21.638
He doesn't know
what you're saying.

01:10:27.109 --> 01:10:29.078
But he knows what I'm feeling.

01:10:32.282 --> 01:10:35.485
I need to get Pikachu
to a healer Pokemon.

01:10:36.152 --> 01:10:38.084
Please.

01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:40.256
I'm begging you.

01:10:41.323 --> 01:10:43.426
I don't wanna lose him, too.

01:10:58.773 --> 01:11:00.209
It's okay.

01:11:03.546 --> 01:11:05.714
Hmm?

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:11.785
Tim, look.

01:11:39.582 --> 01:11:40.649
Okay.

01:11:43.152 --> 01:11:44.821
I'll meet you at the car.

01:12:20.657 --> 01:12:22.559
You're gonna be okay, partner.

01:13:13.108 --> 01:13:14.343
Here?

01:13:26.154 --> 01:13:27.954
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

01:13:27.956 --> 01:13:30.057
Where are you going?

01:13:30.059 --> 01:13:32.325
What am I supposed to do?

01:13:32.327 --> 01:13:34.897
I've been waiting for you.

01:13:39.902 --> 01:13:40.904
Mewtwo.

01:13:42.971 --> 01:13:44.972
No, no, no! No, wait!

01:14:03.126 --> 01:14:04.361
Where am I?

01:14:04.928 --> 01:14:06.326
You're okay!

01:14:06.328 --> 01:14:07.829
Yeah.

01:14:07.831 --> 01:14:09.496
Somehow, I'm fine.

01:14:09.498 --> 01:14:12.434
You brought
the son to me, as agreed.

01:14:14.068 --> 01:14:15.402
What is he talking about?

01:14:15.404 --> 01:14:18.239
I don't know, kid.
I'm as lost as you are.

01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:20.040
Where's my father?

01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:21.344
What'd you do with him?

01:14:33.188 --> 01:14:34.588
- <i>Alert.</i>
- Oh.

01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:37.026
We're losing power
in the containment chamber.

01:14:44.533 --> 01:14:46.435
You've done well.

01:14:47.103 --> 01:14:49.837
Humanity is evil.

01:14:49.839 --> 01:14:52.442
I've always believed
Pokemon are...

01:14:53.742 --> 01:14:56.243
No!

01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:08.058
No!

01:15:32.148 --> 01:15:34.048
Wait, wait, wait!

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:36.683
Pikachu! Wait.

01:15:36.685 --> 01:15:39.853
Hey. Slow down.
We have to talk about this.

01:15:39.855 --> 01:15:41.621
You have to go on without me.

01:15:41.623 --> 01:15:43.391
What? What are you saying?

01:15:43.393 --> 01:15:45.926
Roger has Mewtwo.
Mewtwo has my father.

01:15:45.928 --> 01:15:47.727
We're running out of time.
We have a case to solve.

01:15:47.729 --> 01:15:49.929
We already solved mine.
I know who I am.

01:15:49.931 --> 01:15:52.399
I'm the guy
who betrayed Harry.

01:15:52.401 --> 01:15:53.866
We don't know that.

01:15:53.868 --> 01:15:58.375
We both saw it. I betrayed
your father. Which means

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.540
I could betray you, too.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:02.609
You wouldn't do that.
I don't care what I saw.

01:16:02.611 --> 01:16:04.477
- I know who you are.
- How do you know?

01:16:04.479 --> 01:16:05.812
Because, I...

01:16:05.814 --> 01:16:07.548
I can feel it in my jellies.

01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:08.981
I... I made that up.

01:16:08.983 --> 01:16:11.151
There's no jellies.
There's no me.

01:16:11.153 --> 01:16:12.285
I don't believe that.

01:16:12.287 --> 01:16:13.387
You're better off on your own.

01:16:13.389 --> 01:16:14.554
- Come on, Pikachu...
- No! No!

01:16:14.556 --> 01:16:16.123
I need you. Please.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.892
You have to stay away.
It's for your own good.

01:16:17.894 --> 01:16:19.558
No. I'm not letting you go.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.403
You see?

01:16:27.537 --> 01:16:28.735
I can't help it.

01:16:28.737 --> 01:16:30.739
I hurt the people who need me.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.941
That's who I am.

01:16:33.608 --> 01:16:35.044
I'm sorry.

01:16:36.778 --> 01:16:38.147
I'm sorry.

01:16:38.915 --> 01:16:40.015
Tim.

01:16:41.283 --> 01:16:43.017
Where's he going?

01:16:43.019 --> 01:16:45.054
Hey, what happened?

01:16:46.022 --> 01:16:48.222
Is Pikachu okay?

01:16:48.224 --> 01:16:50.958
No, he's not.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.763
Let's go.
We gotta get back to the city.

01:16:57.332 --> 01:16:58.432
Okay.

01:16:58.434 --> 01:17:00.133
Come on.

01:17:00.135 --> 01:17:02.102
<i>The 10th anniversary</i>

01:17:02.104 --> 01:17:05.172
<i>Ryme City Pokemon parade is
set to begin this afternoon.</i>

01:17:05.174 --> 01:17:07.775
<i>The whole city is converging
on downtown</i>

01:17:07.777 --> 01:17:10.013
<i>to watch
the day's festivities.</i>

01:17:16.685 --> 01:17:18.886
I don't know what happened
between you two,

01:17:18.888 --> 01:17:20.486
but we need
to strategize. Wait!

01:17:20.488 --> 01:17:21.855
Where are you going?

01:17:21.857 --> 01:17:23.089
We need to tell the public
what we found.

01:17:23.091 --> 01:17:24.225
This is breaking news.

01:17:24.227 --> 01:17:26.494
No. No, you should
break the news. You.

01:17:26.496 --> 01:17:28.161
I'm gonna go talk to Howard.

01:17:28.163 --> 01:17:29.562
How...

01:17:29.564 --> 01:17:30.830
Tim!

01:17:30.832 --> 01:17:32.399
How am I supposed to
break the news

01:17:32.401 --> 01:17:35.102
when the guy who runs the news
is the breaking news?

01:17:35.104 --> 01:17:39.676
Okay, Cynthia. We're live
in five, four, three...

01:17:41.309 --> 01:17:42.843
Stay in the car, okay?

01:17:42.845 --> 01:17:43.913
Psyduck!

01:17:57.727 --> 01:17:59.727
Mrs. McMaster.
Hi, it's Lucy Stevens,

01:17:59.729 --> 01:18:00.828
- the intern.
- Oh.

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:02.395
- At CNM?
- Could you...

01:18:02.397 --> 01:18:04.130
Yeah. Erm, I have a story

01:18:04.132 --> 01:18:05.865
that's really important that
the people need to hear.

01:18:05.867 --> 01:18:07.601
And I was really hoping
you could help me tell it.

01:18:07.603 --> 01:18:08.936
I just need...

01:18:08.938 --> 01:18:10.570
Lucy, please.
Take my coffee order.

01:18:10.572 --> 01:18:12.741
Flat white, extra shot.

01:18:15.845 --> 01:18:19.079

What... What is this?

01:18:47.609 --> 01:18:49.045
I know this place.

01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:55.551
This is the scene
of the crash.

01:18:57.752 --> 01:18:59.288
What is that?

01:19:02.457 --> 01:19:03.725
Greninja stars.

01:19:07.696 --> 01:19:09.463
Roger must have
sent the Greninjas

01:19:09.465 --> 01:19:11.597
to cause the crash. Which...

01:19:11.599 --> 01:19:13.901
Which means...

01:19:13.903 --> 01:19:16.773
Mewtwo was trying
to protect us?

01:19:18.675 --> 01:19:20.841
<i>Advanced holographic imaging.</i>

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:23.710
It allows us to see things
that they cannot

01:19:23.712 --> 01:19:25.311
<i>or don't want us to see.</i>

01:19:25.313 --> 01:19:28.915
Wait, Howard would have seen
this in his hologram.

01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:31.151
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

01:19:31.153 --> 01:19:32.953
Tim!

01:19:32.955 --> 01:19:35.722
Howard! Mr. Clifford!
Your son,

01:19:35.724 --> 01:19:38.558
he has Mewtwo here.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.660
- Wait, why do you...
- Tim.

01:19:40.662 --> 01:19:42.928
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:50.438 --> 01:19:52.808
Run!

01:19:53.509 --> 01:19:54.607
No.

01:20:12.795 --> 01:20:15.064
The transfer worked.

01:20:15.965 --> 01:20:17.967
My body is in the chair,

01:20:19.468 --> 01:20:23.169
but my mind is in Mewtwo.

01:20:23.171 --> 01:20:24.303
Howard?

01:20:24.305 --> 01:20:25.638
Well done, Tim.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:30.143
You and Harry's Pikachu
led me straight to Mewtwo.

01:20:30.145 --> 01:20:31.811
Mewtwo didn't cause the crash.

01:20:31.813 --> 01:20:33.681
All your father had to do

01:20:33.683 --> 01:20:35.883
was take the money
and walk away.

01:20:35.885 --> 01:20:37.651
But he started
asking questions.

01:20:37.653 --> 01:20:38.785
I had to stop him.

01:20:38.787 --> 01:20:40.186
You tried to kill him!

01:20:40.188 --> 01:20:41.187
I had no choice.

01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:43.589
He tracked the R
to the battles,

01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:45.325
traced it back to Dr. Laurent.

01:20:45.327 --> 01:20:48.594
And then he and his Pikachu
helped Mewtwo escape.

01:20:52.902 --> 01:20:54.366
So, as you can see,

01:20:54.368 --> 01:20:56.369
we are more than happy
with the turnout today.

01:20:56.371 --> 01:20:58.004
So many families...

01:20:58.006 --> 01:20:59.806
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:20:59.808 --> 01:21:01.441
That's all for today.
Thank you.

01:21:01.443 --> 01:21:03.244
Excuse me, please. Hello. Hi.

01:21:03.246 --> 01:21:05.311
I have an interview
with the mayor.

01:21:05.313 --> 01:21:07.146
- Go on through.
- Thank you.

01:21:07.148 --> 01:21:09.650
Mr. Mayor, I need to speak
with you, please. It's urgent.

01:21:09.652 --> 01:21:11.384
A little late for an
interview, don't you think?

01:21:11.386 --> 01:21:12.421
Please!

01:21:14.157 --> 01:21:15.621
Before we begin the parade,

01:21:15.623 --> 01:21:17.458
I'd like to thank
our benefactor,

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:18.726
Howard Clifford.

01:21:18.728 --> 01:21:21.061
This was never
about curing me.

01:21:21.063 --> 01:21:24.597
I have found a path forward
for all of us.

01:21:24.599 --> 01:21:26.165
Mewtwo has the power

01:21:26.167 --> 01:21:28.035
to transfer
the soul of a human

01:21:28.037 --> 01:21:29.468
into the body of a Pokemon,

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:33.606
as long as the Pokemon
are in a crazed state.

01:21:33.608 --> 01:21:36.044
The R gas takes care of that.

01:21:37.947 --> 01:21:40.950
The balloons.
The R gas is in the balloons.

01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:52.860
People of Ryme City!

01:21:52.862 --> 01:21:55.762
I've finally discovered
a cure.

01:21:55.764 --> 01:21:57.864
Not just for me,

01:21:57.866 --> 01:22:00.467
but for all of humanity!

01:22:00.469 --> 01:22:05.003
Pokemon can evolve into better
versions of themselves.

01:22:05.005 --> 01:22:07.807
And, now, so can you!

01:22:07.809 --> 01:22:12.381
Humans and Pokemon
merged into one!

01:22:25.093 --> 01:22:27.764
Don't let your Pokemon breathe
the purple gas!

01:22:29.997 --> 01:22:31.366
Come on! Get out of here!

01:22:35.237 --> 01:22:37.804
This is Yoshida
requesting backup!

01:22:37.806 --> 01:22:40.607
All units should proceed
to the...

01:22:40.609 --> 01:22:42.978
Snubbull, no!

01:22:52.888 --> 01:22:54.887
Don't let your Pokemon
breathe the gas!

01:22:54.889 --> 01:22:56.222
Don't let your Pokemon...

01:22:56.224 --> 01:22:58.160
Oh, no! Don't breathe the gas!

01:23:01.429 --> 01:23:02.795
Tell them!

01:23:02.797 --> 01:23:04.763
This is Lucy Stevens reporting
a citywide emergency.

01:23:04.765 --> 01:23:06.266
Do not let
your Pokemon breathe...

01:23:06.268 --> 01:23:07.908
Psyduck, no! Don't!

01:23:10.139 --> 01:23:13.242
Psyduck,
Psyduck. Psyduck!

01:23:15.877 --> 01:23:17.279
Psyduck?

01:23:25.319 --> 01:23:28.823
Okay. Worst parade
I've ever seen.

01:23:28.825 --> 01:23:31.357
- Psyduck.
- Lucy. Lucy, you're in there?

01:23:31.359 --> 01:23:33.293
- Where's Tim?
- Psyduck. Psyduck.

01:23:33.295 --> 01:23:37.797
- Howard is Mewtwo?
- Psyduck. Psyduck.

01:23:37.799 --> 01:23:41.802
This really blows my bridge
discovery out of the water.

01:23:41.804 --> 01:23:44.570
All right, I gotta stop this.

01:23:44.572 --> 01:23:45.575
Game on!

01:23:55.584 --> 01:23:58.852
Okay, Pikachu, your powers
are in there somewhere.

01:23:58.854 --> 01:24:00.219
Just need a little spark

01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:02.121
to get this party started.
Let's do this.

01:24:09.799 --> 01:24:11.998
Harry's Pikachu.

01:24:13.468 --> 01:24:16.904
You think you can stand
in the way of the future?

01:24:16.906 --> 01:24:19.041
I am the future!

01:24:30.286 --> 01:24:31.287
Whoa!

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:03.048
He's back!

01:25:12.795 --> 01:25:14.427
The neural link.

01:25:20.903 --> 01:25:22.104
Roger?

01:25:25.107 --> 01:25:26.408
Behind you!

01:25:40.621 --> 01:25:41.957
You're a Ditto.

01:25:42.925 --> 01:25:44.126
Ditto.

01:25:55.237 --> 01:25:57.536
Bank left! Bank right! Right!

01:25:57.538 --> 01:26:00.740
Where did you learn
how to fly? The ground?

01:26:00.742 --> 01:26:03.746
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop!
Wait, wait, wait!

01:26:05.214 --> 01:26:06.415
Wait, wait, wait!

01:26:11.886 --> 01:26:14.320
Come on. No. That's not fair.

01:26:18.359 --> 01:26:20.160
For the record,
I have no guilt

01:26:20.162 --> 01:26:21.927
hitting a beady-eyed
version of the woman

01:26:21.929 --> 01:26:23.231
I'm very attracted to.

01:26:27.603 --> 01:26:30.706
Uh-oh! Pull up, pull up.
Don't breathe the gas.

01:26:31.873 --> 01:26:33.807
You breathed the gas,
didn't you?

01:26:42.251 --> 01:26:43.584
Yeah!

01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:10.009
Finish him, Ditto!

01:27:10.011 --> 01:27:11.212
Ditto!

01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:24.259
No! No, no, no, no!

01:27:29.864 --> 01:27:31.200
Pikachu!

01:27:32.134 --> 01:27:34.801
Tim!

01:27:34.803 --> 01:27:37.669
Harry's son is finished!

01:27:37.671 --> 01:27:41.307
No. Tim said Volt Tackle's
my best move.

01:27:41.309 --> 01:27:44.076
Let's do this
Pokemon battle thing right.

01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:54.987
No.

01:28:02.831 --> 01:28:04.130
Yeah!

01:28:04.132 --> 01:28:05.966
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

01:28:11.038 --> 01:28:12.673
What kind of a Ditto was that?

01:28:12.675 --> 01:28:16.142
That was one of my father's
genetic experiments.

01:28:44.973 --> 01:28:47.106
Psyduck. Ditto.

01:28:47.108 --> 01:28:48.843
Ditto...

01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:02.755
A feeble effort.

01:29:02.757 --> 01:29:07.895
A Pikachu cannot defeat
Mewtwo in battle.

01:29:07.897 --> 01:29:10.230
I didn't need to defeat you.

01:29:10.232 --> 01:29:12.701
I just needed to distract you.

01:29:15.036 --> 01:29:16.238
Huh.

01:29:17.104 --> 01:29:18.439
No!

01:29:18.907 --> 01:29:20.309
No!

01:29:24.379 --> 01:29:26.614
What have you done?

01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:30.585
Pikachu!

01:29:31.586 --> 01:29:32.621
No!

01:29:47.035 --> 01:29:49.535
- Pikachu!
- Tim!

01:29:49.537 --> 01:29:51.271
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

01:29:51.273 --> 01:29:53.739
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I pushed you away

01:29:53.741 --> 01:29:55.575
just when you needed me
the most.

01:29:55.577 --> 01:29:57.879
I'm just happy you're back...

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.315
partner.

01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.884
Please tell me
you can fix this mess.

01:30:04.886 --> 01:30:08.456
I will undo
what has been done.

01:30:39.254 --> 01:30:42.690
Let's never
do that again, okay?

01:30:58.607 --> 01:31:02.174
The strange thing is that,
no matter what his flaws,

01:31:02.176 --> 01:31:04.477
deep down,

01:31:04.479 --> 01:31:07.813
I blame myself
for not being there for him.

01:31:07.815 --> 01:31:10.482
You. You were working
on this story.

01:31:10.484 --> 01:31:13.252
Had a lead on it before
anyone else even knew.

01:31:13.254 --> 01:31:14.553
That's correct.

01:31:14.555 --> 01:31:15.888
Good. Right,
you're going on camera.

01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:17.591
I want you giving
an in-depth report

01:31:17.593 --> 01:31:19.592
for CNM tonight, primetime.

01:31:19.594 --> 01:31:21.360
And make sure you close with:

01:31:21.362 --> 01:31:23.629
"Roger Clifford
pledges to undo

01:31:23.631 --> 01:31:25.731
all the harm his father caused

01:31:25.733 --> 01:31:29.504
starting with the Pokemon
he experimented on."

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.240
I can't believe we did it.

01:31:34.242 --> 01:31:35.874
Psyduck.

01:31:35.876 --> 01:31:39.344
Great work. Hey, calm down.
Stay calm. Okay.

01:31:39.346 --> 01:31:40.646
Oh, I hope we never

01:31:40.648 --> 01:31:42.214
- get to see each other again.
- Hmm.

01:31:42.216 --> 01:31:45.584
- Meet me later tonight?
- Cool. I mean, yeah.

01:31:45.586 --> 01:31:47.522
Okay.

01:31:49.157 --> 01:31:50.390
Come on.

01:31:50.392 --> 01:31:51.991
Psyduck.
Psyduck. Psyduck.

01:31:53.228 --> 01:31:54.596
Way to go, Tim.

01:31:55.964 --> 01:31:59.702
There is one last thing
I must fix.

01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:05.237
My father.

01:32:05.239 --> 01:32:07.574
The father
you have been looking for

01:32:07.576 --> 01:32:10.479
has been with you all along.

01:32:12.212 --> 01:32:13.916
What's he talking about?

01:32:15.483 --> 01:32:16.852
I don't...

01:32:36.071 --> 01:32:37.402
Pika!

01:32:37.404 --> 01:32:39.504
Pikachu!

01:32:39.506 --> 01:32:41.341
You've done well.

01:32:41.343 --> 01:32:44.276
Humanity is evil.

01:32:44.278 --> 01:32:49.384
But you have shown me
that not all humans are bad.

01:32:50.251 --> 01:32:51.784
Harry Goodman,

01:32:51.786 --> 01:32:55.987
your Pikachu offers its body
to save your mind.

01:32:55.989 --> 01:32:58.091
There is a son.

01:32:58.093 --> 01:33:02.261
With the son's return,
I can repair the father.

01:33:02.263 --> 01:33:03.963
Your memory will be gone,

01:33:03.965 --> 01:33:07.533
but your heart will know
who you are.

01:33:07.535 --> 01:33:10.973
I take this body
so that you might live.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.475
Return with the son.

01:33:35.796 --> 01:33:38.364
<i>Now boarding on track three,</i>

01:33:38.366 --> 01:33:40.732
<i>train 453 northbound.</i>

01:33:45.105 --> 01:33:46.541
Hey, kid!

01:34:03.524 --> 01:34:05.727
Grams will meet you
when you arrive.

01:34:06.929 --> 01:34:07.996
Okay.

01:34:14.702 --> 01:34:16.205
I'll see ya.

01:34:17.973 --> 01:34:19.140
See ya.

01:34:45.233 --> 01:34:46.602
Pika.

01:34:49.638 --> 01:34:51.073
Hey, Dad?

01:34:52.306 --> 01:34:53.509
Yeah?

01:34:55.277 --> 01:34:57.613
You think I can stay with you
for a while?

01:35:00.314 --> 01:35:02.017
I'd like that, kid.

01:35:02.884 --> 01:35:05.053
