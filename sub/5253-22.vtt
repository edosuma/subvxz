whether it's good or bad,

16:50.625 --> 16:53.604
you're the first person I
want to talk to about it.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.597
Yeah, we've known each other for so long

16:57.599 --> 16:59.596
and been through so much,

17:00.335 --> 17:03.903
you're like a blankie that
smells like my mom's oak chest

17:03.905 --> 17:06.372
and still has bite marks
from when I was teething.

17:06.374 --> 17:08.473
Gee, thanks. I'm a ratty old blanket?

17:08.476 --> 17:10.810
You know what I mean. You're like...

17:10.811 --> 17:14.290
I don't know, home to me.

17:15.383 --> 17:17.483
Well, one thing's for certain.

17:17.484 --> 17:19.218
Our timing's always been off.

17:19.220 --> 17:20.887
[vehicle approaching]

17:22.823 --> 17:24.390
Always.

Patrick.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.274
Hi, it's me.

17:34.837 --> 17:38.539
There's something that
I need to tell you.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.344
How did he know where to find me?

17:43.346 --> 17:45.079
He texted me looking for you.

17:45.081 --> 17:47.173
Wait, I'm sorry. You guys text?

17:47.817 --> 17:49.984
You weren't answering my calls.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.719
He said he really needed to apologize.

17:51.721 --> 17:53.721
And I thought you'd want to hear it.

17:53.723 --> 17:55.189
I'm sorry I involved you, man.

17:55.191 --> 17:56.690
It's just, whenever something happens,

17:56.692 --> 17:58.493
you're the one she wants to talk to.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.823
Can I talk to you?

18:09.105 --> 18:10.871
Jenna, look, I'm sorry.

18:10.873 --> 18:13.493
I don't know what got
into me this morning.

18:14.443 --> 18:15.643
[sighs]

18:15.645 --> 18:17.611
Actually, no. I do know.

18:17.613 --> 18:20.281
You were right about me and Lizzy.

18:20.283 --> 18:22.183
- What?
- Nothing happened.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.617
Nothing ever would happen.

18:23.619 --> 18:24.952
I have to admit that I wanted Lizzy

18:24.954 --> 18:27.087
to think that it was
still a possibility.

18:27.089 --> 18:30.224
All the author events and
the readings she takes me to,

18:30.226 --> 18:31.618
they're a huge opportunity.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.563
And I'm not in a position
to turn that stuff down.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.779
I'm sorry I couldn't
just admit it earlier,

18:35.781 --> 18:37.914
but I hadn't really
admitted it to myself.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.184
That's why I was such a jerk
when you called me on it.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.516
Okay.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.930
I was wrong.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.735
And I was weak.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.428
And I'm really embarrassed.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.751
And sorry.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.098
Can you forgive me?

18:54.100 --> 18:57.068
As far as apologies go,
that was a pretty good one.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.536
I can do better.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.671
Do you remember how you always wanted

18:59.673 --> 19:01.172
to get into SCU more than anything?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.540
Dean Strauss just emailed me.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.696
He loves your stuff,

19:03.721 --> 19:05.209
and he wants you to
come in for an interview.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.477
Are you serious?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.945
He thinks you have a unique voice.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.214
I sent him a couple of your
best pieces a few weeks ago.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.683
I hope that's okay.

19:11.685 --> 19:12.784
I wanted it to be a surprise.

19:12.786 --> 19:15.046
I'm definitely surprised.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.654
With your grades from Wyckoff

19:16.656 --> 19:17.989
and your track record at Idea Bin,

19:17.991 --> 19:19.857
you have a real shot at transferring.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.927
This is amazing. I can't
believe you did that.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.274
Huh!

19:24.998 --> 19:26.664
He really said I have a unique voice?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.633
- He really said that?
- I have the email to prove it.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.938
Let's go home.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.970
I stocked the freezer with Rocky Road.

You are a really good apologizer.
