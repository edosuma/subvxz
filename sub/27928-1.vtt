02:05.125 --> 02:07.083
- Take cover!

02:58.569 --> 02:59.875
- Hey, soul man.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.485
You got girlfriend?

03:02.486 --> 03:04.749
- Yeah, nah, I'm good.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.838
- Boom-boom, you
want special price?

03:08.927 --> 03:10.625
- You speak Vietnamese?

03:10.799 --> 03:13.671
- Enough to get me a little
ass and grass if I want it.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.283
- You're full of shit, Felix.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.855
- Casper, you all right?

03:24.029 --> 03:25.509
- One, no I ain't.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.905
Two, quit callin' me Casper.

03:30.079 --> 03:30.949
You know I hate that shit.

03:33.082 --> 03:36.085
- Seriously man,
what's up with you?

03:40.132 --> 03:41.090
- Two.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.439
- Oh, come on man, have one.

03:42.613 --> 03:43.701
- I'm havin' a
beer, motherfucker.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.355
I'm talkin' about Charlie.

03:45.529 --> 03:46.356
Two VC.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.445
- Out in the shit?

03:48.619 --> 03:50.795
- Yes, out in the shit.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.275
Just two VC.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.711
- That ain't
nothin' new, Casper.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.844
You been out in the shit
as long as any of us.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.020
Charlie sits in the hooch
and waits on a couple of GIs

03:58.194 --> 03:59.848
to walk by, and then boof!

04:00.022 --> 04:03.504
Pulls a machine gun out
of his ass and lays waste.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.201
You just gotta look sharp.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.159
- You can't look sharp
for a hole in the ground.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.900
Who's watchin' whose back?

04:09.074 --> 04:10.424
Who's watchin' Whittaker's back?

04:10.598 --> 04:11.773
- You got somethin'
you wanna say?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.253
- Whittaker wasn't
anybody's fault

04:13.427 --> 04:16.212
except the VC that
got the jump on us.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.694
- I'm sayin', who's
got our backs?

04:19.868 --> 04:21.348
You think it's
Lieutenant Sutter?

04:21.522 --> 04:23.132
Or Meeks with the heavy?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.003
Who you think put Whittaker
on point to begin with?

04:25.177 --> 04:27.571
- It was his rotation.

04:27.745 --> 04:32.533
- That's Whittaker, right there
before he bought the farm.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.187
That's my black ass.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.803
And these two
motherfuckers is y'all.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.416
And then right behind
us is Lieutenant Sutter,

04:46.590 --> 04:49.289
over here sniffin' up Joe's ass.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.515
And here's Dan,
Archie, and Meeks.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.127
You notice something
weird about that?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.477
- It's random.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.611
- Whole buncha negros
sittin' on point,

05:07.785 --> 05:09.961
takin' Charlie's first shot.

05:10.135 --> 05:13.400
Point men die like
flies in shit.

05:13.574 --> 05:17.012
Walk around a fuckin'
tree, there's a VC, boom!

05:17.186 --> 05:18.753
You're fuckin' dead.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.885
Sorry negro, you're on point.

05:21.059 --> 05:26.064
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.284
You're fuckin' dead.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.069
- Don't even sweat it, man.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.158
You got five more months.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.769
Then it's back to the world.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.988
- And we got Private Whittaker's
replacement comin' in.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.425
Private FNG.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.383
They'll stick his ass on point.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.907
That's how it's always been.

05:43.081 --> 05:43.952
- FNG?

05:44.779 --> 05:45.823
Fuck a negro?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.651
- Fuckin' new guy.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.174
It ain't some big conspiracy.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.611
It's the US Army.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.788
- They fuckin' you
in the ass, Felix.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.312
- Hey, it's almost one o'clock.

05:56.486 --> 05:59.489
- Yeah, come on,
let's get goin'.

05:59.663 --> 06:00.621
FNGs.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.498
- All right boys, we got
a sweep on our hands.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.631
Ben Tre's a small provincial
city about 60 klicks

06:10.805 --> 06:12.502
south of our current position.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.156
But the surrounding area needs
to be swept for Viet Cong.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.549
- Sir, standard
rules of engagement?

06:15.723 --> 06:17.115
Search and destroy?

06:17.289 --> 06:18.813
- Well, we're callin'
it sweeping now.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.643
Lieutenant Sutter, you
want to give 'em the rest?

06:24.732 --> 06:26.386
- All right, two days ago, we
lost contact with a platoon

06:26.560 --> 06:27.822
out of the 39th.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.214
Got separated from
their company,

06:29.389 --> 06:31.347
and no one's heard
from them since.

06:31.521 --> 06:32.827
So there's two points.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.090
First, we're not aware
of any major VC presence

06:35.264 --> 06:36.744
in the area, but stay alert.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.441
Don't wanna have
any friendly fire.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.443
- Sir, how do we know
it's them if we find them?

06:40.617 --> 06:41.662
- They are the only
American troops

06:41.836 --> 06:43.228
in that part of the delta.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.536
So if you guys see
anybody, anyone,

06:46.710 --> 06:49.191
and they're not a gook,
they're either your own company

06:49.365 --> 06:50.714
or the missing platoon,

06:50.888 --> 06:52.237
and you will know
them if you find them.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.849
Turns out they're
part of Bravo company.

06:55.023 --> 06:57.025
Lieutenant Marsh's boys.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.419
And they are a salty bunch.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.334
You'll know.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.511
- Drop time's 0600 at LZ Echo.

07:04.685 --> 07:05.642
Be ready.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.122
- Yes, sir.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.510
- Hey Meeks.

07:47.684 --> 07:48.903
What's with that?

07:49.077 --> 07:50.905
- It's an M60.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.602
Machine gun.

07:52.776 --> 07:53.516
- Nah, not that.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.213
What's next to it?

07:56.214 --> 07:57.738
That a belt buckle?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.436
- Oh, you mean that?

08:01.393 --> 08:03.613
Yeah, that's a belt buckle.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.270
- Well hey, I love learnin'
about belt buckles.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.098
What's the CS mean?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.884
- Means you care about
where you came from.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.191
- You mind if I take
a look at your belt buckle?

08:16.365 --> 08:17.322
- I'd rather you not.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.672
- Well, why not?

08:18.846 --> 08:19.803
I just want to
take a look at it.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.065
- It's special.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.632
It was a gift.

08:22.806 --> 08:23.633
- From the Confederate
States, I take it?

08:23.807 --> 08:25.592
Someone from around there?

08:25.766 --> 08:26.810
- It's from my daddy.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.203
- Your daddy?

08:28.377 --> 08:31.075
He from around
Confederate States?

08:31.249 --> 08:34.078
- He carried it into battle
with him at Guadalcanal,

08:34.251 --> 08:36.602
and passed it on to me.

08:36.777 --> 08:37.908
Heritage.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.475
An unbroken line.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.347
It means something.

08:42.522 --> 08:47.701
- So your daddy, he from
Philadelphia, New York, Chicago?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.790
- Jackson, Mississippi.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.097
- So I guess your
heritage probably involved

08:53.271 --> 08:55.622
a couple of tracts of land
with contract labor, huh?

08:59.930 --> 09:02.716
- As a matter of fact, no.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.980
We were the labor.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.373
My great-great-great
granddaddy scrapped in the dirt

09:08.548 --> 09:10.724
on his boss' farm until
the good Lord called him

09:10.898 --> 09:12.377
to defend his land
from the overreach

09:12.552 --> 09:15.119
of the federal government.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.600
- Sounds like a real sucker.

09:21.996 --> 09:22.779
- Yeah.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.607
Oh yeah, maybe so.

09:27.697 --> 09:31.309
He sure got to shoot a lot of
niggers in blue shirts though.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.487
- You got some shit
you want to say to me?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.576
- Oh, I think I just said it.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.359
- Fuck you.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.187
- Fuck you.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.144
- Atten-hut!

09:40.318 --> 09:41.885
- As you were.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.408
What's goin' on?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.149
- Oh, just preppin'
for the boonies, LT.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.761
- What about you, Allen?

09:47.935 --> 09:49.458
You ready?

09:50.024 --> 09:51.634
- Almost.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.159
- Well, best finish up.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.727
Because almost ain't gonna
cut it out there tomorrow.

10:00.817 --> 10:01.862
This...

10:03.211 --> 10:04.255
Is Private...

10:06.214 --> 10:07.737
What was it again?

10:07.911 --> 10:08.869
- Ham, sir.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.044
Matthew Ham.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.569
- He's Whittaker's replacement.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.006
Get Private Ham up to
speed, get some rack time.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.400
We're on deck at 0500.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.055
That's five fuckin' a.m., FNG.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.368
- Lookin' forward to gettin'
to work with you fellas.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.241
- Charlie's gonna eat
you for lunch, boy.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.459
- Not if I can help it.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
- What'd you just say?

10:36.810 --> 10:38.507
- I said, not if I can help it.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.770
I'm gonna give
'em my best fight.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.424
- Your best fight?

10:44.034 --> 10:46.080
You think this is D-Day?

10:46.254 --> 10:47.603
You think the slopes
give two shits

10:47.777 --> 10:49.823
what kind of fight
you're gonna give 'em?

10:49.997 --> 10:51.215
They think you'll
give 'em a fight,

10:51.389 --> 10:52.739
they'll just slither
off and hide in the dark

10:52.913 --> 10:54.741
and let you step on a
booby-trap mortar round

10:54.915 --> 10:56.786
and blow your foot off,

10:56.960 --> 10:59.223
or fall in a tiger pit and
impale your leg on spikes,

10:59.397 --> 11:00.964
and then they'll shoot
whoever's gotta carry

11:01.138 --> 11:02.792
your sorry ass back.

11:04.054 --> 11:07.362
It's best to just not
get hit, Private Ham.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
- Then I guess I'll
just do the hitting.

11:14.325 --> 11:17.415
- Looks like we
found our point man.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.558
- All right, two minutes!

11:29.732 --> 11:31.125
LZ should be clear,

11:31.299 --> 11:33.605
but we are still
establishing a perimeter!

11:33.780 --> 11:35.433
You all know the drill.

11:35.607 --> 11:36.913
- We goin' in hot?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.263
- Only if we get
eyes on Charlie!

11:39.437 --> 11:41.396
You all look sharp, you hear me?

11:41.570 --> 11:43.093
And save your ammo!

11:46.836 --> 11:49.056
- Hey, FNG!

11:50.448 --> 11:51.841
You know what
happens if the slopes

11:52.015 --> 11:54.496
capture you alive, right?

11:54.670 --> 11:56.063
- I don't know.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.978
- They'll strip you
down to your bare ass

11:58.152 --> 12:01.416
and walk you into a
minefield at gunpoint.

12:01.590 --> 12:05.725
If you're lucky, you lose a
leg and bleed out right away.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.684
I saw an FNG lose his toes,

12:08.858 --> 12:10.773
and the tip of his dick.

12:10.947 --> 12:12.296
A bad way to go!

12:14.168 --> 12:16.474
- Just keep your head down.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.263
- 30 seconds!

12:23.830 --> 12:26.267
- All right, lock and load!

- Why don't you lighten up?

13:18.972 --> 13:20.669
There ain't no slopes out here.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.758
- Motherfucker, I'm out here,
and I gotta listen to you.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.413
- Watch your mouth, boy.

13:25.587 --> 13:26.675
You just ain't got culture.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.069
- Oh, I got culture, boy.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.811
You just ain't Frank Sinatra.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.551
You sound like my little

13:51.918 --> 13:52.788
- Yeah?

13:54.529 --> 13:55.617
- You a virgin?

13:55.791 --> 13:56.487
- What?

13:56.661 --> 13:58.315
- Now, don't lie.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.274
I can always tell when a
guy's lyin' about that shit.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.275
Hey, Felix.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.235
How 'bout the first
time you fucked a girl?

14:05.409 --> 14:08.151
- Man, I hit some fine-ass
Columbian chick back in the day

14:08.325 --> 14:09.761
behind a movie.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.676
I was 15, she was 19.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.069
She kept comin' back for more.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.506
- See, now half of
that was bullshit.

14:15.680 --> 14:20.381
He was 15, she was 19, but
she didn't come back for more.

14:20.903 --> 14:24.298
Casper, you a virgin?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.778
- My name ain't Casper.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.519
- Come on, just your first.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.086
How old were you?

14:32.132 --> 14:32.959
- 16.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.484
- Where?
- At a church.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.486
- At a church?
- In church.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.009
- Yeah, I bet you gave it to her

14:40.183 --> 14:41.837
right up there on the
altar, didn't you?

14:42.011 --> 14:45.449
- Nope, broom
closet, in the foyer.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.103
During church.

14:49.801 --> 14:52.630
- Well now, none
of that's bullshit.

14:52.804 --> 14:56.069
Ham, how did you
lose your virginity?

14:56.243 --> 14:57.853
- I was at the ballpark.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.028
Fenway Park.

14:59.986 --> 15:00.725
- Bullshit.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.597
- No, no, I swear.

15:02.771 --> 15:03.598
I would work the refreshment
stands there during summers

15:03.772 --> 15:05.382
in high school.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.428
I used to go bang this
chick real hard in the back.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.431
- Now how'd you get away
with that at Fenway Park?

15:10.605 --> 15:11.562
- I would turn the
popcorn machine on

15:11.736 --> 15:13.086
so no one would hear us.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.696
- Man, you didn't fuck
her in no popcorn.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.003
- No, not in the popcorn.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.569
In the room behind it.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.658
- So this is what, uh, '66?

15:20.832 --> 15:21.921
Uh, '67?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.487
- '66.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.054
- You know, I went
to Fenway Park in '66

15:25.228 --> 15:27.013
with my daddy to
watch an Orioles game.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.710
So we get to our seats,

15:28.884 --> 15:31.800
and daddy asked me if I
wanted anything to eat.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.410
And I said, "Sure, daddy.

15:33.584 --> 15:37.197
"I want a Coca Cola and
maybe some popcorn."

15:38.720 --> 15:41.462
So daddy comes back with
a Coca Cola and a hotdog.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.159
I said, "Daddy, what's
that hotdog for?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.248
"I said I wanted popcorn."

15:45.422 --> 15:48.077
And he said, "Son, I
know, but the man told me

15:48.251 --> 15:49.861
"that you have to order
popcorn from the man

15:50.036 --> 15:53.256
"walking up and
down the stands."

15:53.430 --> 15:55.693
'Cause they don't sell popcorn
at the refreshment counters

15:55.867 --> 15:57.043
at Fenway Park.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.305
- Oh!

15:58.479 --> 15:59.523
- Guys, come on, I swear!

15:59.697 --> 16:01.003
No, seriously!

16:01.177 --> 16:02.439
- Oh, we
gonna have to find Ham

16:02.613 --> 16:03.919
a nice little mama-san
to practice on.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.008
- Okay, yeah, hey,
very funny, but no.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.923
- I said lock it up!

16:08.097 --> 16:09.577
We are five klicks from Phong My

16:09.751 --> 16:13.581
and you clowns sound
like a goddamn Army band.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.244
- It's a village.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.375
- Phong My?

16:26.202 --> 16:29.336
- Can't be Phong My,
we're too far out.

16:29.510 --> 16:34.428
Phong Nam's closer, but it's
still three klicks off course.

16:38.475 --> 16:41.913
Nah, it's probably
just some random hooch.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.741
- We sweepin' it?

16:43.915 --> 16:45.265
- Well, that's orders.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.136
- One platoon's
gonna be enough?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.225
- Yeah, one's all we need.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.271
We start takin' fire, all
we gotta do is radio it in

16:51.445 --> 16:54.230
to Third Platoon and the
whole damn company shows up.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.276
Charlie knows it.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.323
Fuck.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.194
Any of y'all speak
any Vietnamese?

17:01.368 --> 17:02.630
- Yeah, a little.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.980
- How the hell you
speak Vietnamese?

17:05.154 --> 17:07.461
- Vietnamese lady
babysat me as a kid.

17:14.032 --> 17:14.903
- English.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.426
Hmm?

17:17.601 --> 17:18.428
Wake!

17:22.388 --> 17:24.739
Ask her how many
people stay here.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.354
- Ah?

17:31.528 --> 17:32.921
- What the hell you tellin' her?

17:33.095 --> 17:35.010
- I'm askin' her how
many people stay here.

17:42.017 --> 17:42.931
She says it's just her, sir.

17:46.369 --> 17:47.631
- Bullshit.

17:53.028 --> 17:56.205
- She says we killed
her whole family, sir.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.207
- Well, ain't that
a fuckin' sob story.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.730
Is she VC?

17:59.904 --> 18:01.210
VC?

18:01.384 --> 18:02.211
V...

18:03.169 --> 18:04.387
- VC?

18:05.475 --> 18:07.216
- Hey, Ms. Charlie.

18:07.390 --> 18:08.652
You see that M60 and that big
ol' belt of ammo back there?

18:08.826 --> 18:10.567
Hmm?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.569
Now that thing's gonna turn
your house and probably you

18:12.743 --> 18:16.182
into dog food if I find out
that any of those commies

18:16.356 --> 18:17.531
are comin' up through here.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.663
Do I make myself clear?

18:20.664 --> 18:22.101
Wake, tell her.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.630
- I think she's
telling the truth, sir.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.675
- I think she's full of shit.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.242
- Why's that?

18:33.416 --> 18:35.157
- 'Cause that lady
wants to kill yo ass.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.767
She could be a runner.

18:36.941 --> 18:37.899
- Runner?

18:38.073 --> 18:40.684
- Runs messages for the slopes.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.599
I think we oughta
torch the place.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.211
- I tell you what, Ms. Charlie.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.520
How 'bout I go light up
your hooch over there, huh?

18:50.694 --> 18:51.565
Or...

18:53.523 --> 18:55.917
You can let Private
Ham light up yours.

18:56.091 --> 18:56.961
- What?

18:58.659 --> 18:59.964
- I don't know how
to say all that, sir.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.575
- No, you don't have to.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.098
She gets the gist.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.535
Don't you, Ms. Charlie?

19:05.709 --> 19:06.580
Ham!

19:10.627 --> 19:14.457
Why do you say to some prime
Vietnamese real estate?

19:14.631 --> 19:17.156
You don't even need
a popcorn machine.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.244
- I say no.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.686
- Let's get somethin'
straight here, PFC.

19:25.860 --> 19:26.730
Dumbass.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.907
You got a problem?

19:30.081 --> 19:31.082
Swallow it.

19:34.564 --> 19:35.261
- It's all clear, sir.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.784
It's just a hut.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.221
- Oh well.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.269
Looks like it's your
lucky day, Ms. Charlie.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.922
All right, pack it up, boys.

19:45.096 --> 19:46.576
We're movin' out.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.667
You better watch your step.

19:50.841 --> 19:51.973
- Or what?

19:52.147 --> 19:54.628
You gonna put me on point?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.543
- You know what?

19:56.717 --> 19:58.545
That ain't a bad idea.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.474
- So what happened
to all that talk

20:14.648 --> 20:17.303
about putting the
black man on point?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.218
- What about it?

20:19.392 --> 20:21.655
- You're lettin'
Sutter have his way.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.004
- No, I ain't.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.615
- You're on point.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.617
- I wanna be on point.

20:28.401 --> 20:31.752
- That's the most
dangerous position.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.754
- No it ain't, not
out here in the jungle

20:33.928 --> 20:36.278
with the whole platoon.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.499
- What do you mean?

20:39.673 --> 20:42.284
- Charlie ain't gonna fuck
with us head on out here.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.678
We's got the advantage.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.681
Nah, they, they gonna
let us do our thing,

20:47.855 --> 20:49.683
and then pick at us
from the shadows.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.424
So hell, if anybody goes down,

20:51.598 --> 20:52.425
it's gonna be somebody
from the middle of the line

20:52.599 --> 20:54.296
back there, you know?

20:54.470 --> 20:57.908
They gonna shoot him in the
leg or blow his toes off,

20:58.082 --> 21:01.216
to make two guys drag
his ass back to the LZ.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.567
One bullet, three
men off the field.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.526
- Maybe we oughta
runs our mouths more often.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.051
- Hell, we all just
bait out here anyway.

21:10.225 --> 21:13.097
We find the VC and get
fire support involved.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.274
That's where the money's at.

21:15.448 --> 21:19.190
- Everything is always some
big conspiracy theory with you.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.454
Maybe our country is just
trying to help these people

21:21.628 --> 21:23.543
live free lives--
- Hey!

21:25.936 --> 21:27.460
Smell that?

21:27.634 --> 21:28.461
- What?

21:30.593 --> 21:32.943
- Smell like a motherfucker.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.757
- Everyone down!

22:12.461 --> 22:13.767
Return fire!

22:19.816 --> 22:21.165
- They've got us pinned!

22:23.298 --> 22:24.212
- Fuck!

22:24.386 --> 22:26.257
- Where's the fuckin' thumpers?

22:26.432 --> 22:28.347
- They're down, both of 'em!

22:34.657 --> 22:36.790
- Hey, get the
fuckin' pig up there!

22:36.964 --> 22:39.575
- I can't, they'll cut us down!

22:43.927 --> 22:44.798
- RPG!

22:51.500 --> 22:53.937
- We're taking too many hits!

22:54.111 --> 22:55.069
- RTO!

22:55.243 --> 22:56.984
Get the fuck up here!

23:07.603 --> 23:09.518
- Sir, they're cut off!

23:15.698 --> 23:16.699
- Fuck this!

23:18.832 --> 23:19.572
Broken Arrow, Broken Arrow!

23:19.746 --> 23:20.486
We're getting overrun--

23:25.534 --> 23:26.970
- Fuck, we need cover!

23:27.144 --> 23:29.538
- Fuck, they're on top of us!

23:43.030 --> 23:44.597
- They got heavies!

23:47.513 --> 23:48.862
Fuck!

23:57.653 --> 23:58.437
Fall back!

24:02.441 --> 24:03.311
Fall back!

24:05.356 --> 24:06.314
Fuckin' go!

24:06.488 --> 24:07.663
Go, fall back!

24:10.274 --> 24:11.232
- Hey!

24:11.406 --> 24:12.886
Hey, we need support!

24:16.193 --> 24:17.064
Hey, hey!

24:18.631 --> 24:21.068
- We are gonna die if
we don't lay some fire!

24:21.242 --> 24:24.898
Get the pig up there
and wait for my signal!

24:25.072 --> 24:27.161
You frag left, I'll frag right.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.209
You feed ammo, on my signal.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.733
One, two, three!

24:38.041 --> 24:38.912
Now!

25:09.551 --> 25:10.421
- Fuck!

25:13.120 --> 25:15.252
We follow Sutter, we die!

25:16.210 --> 25:17.516
That way, that way!

25:17.690 --> 25:19.343
Felix, you're first!

25:19.518 --> 25:20.954
Go, go, go!

25:26.350 --> 25:27.395
Joe, go!

25:51.288 --> 25:52.507
- So what now?

25:53.726 --> 25:55.641
We gonna run right into 'em?

25:55.815 --> 25:58.557
- That heavy's
all they got left.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.515
- They got a crew.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.996
They know we're cut off.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.432
- Man, they comin' for us.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.608
You know they comin' for us.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.176
They just gotta
follow our trail.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.178
- We keep runnin'?

26:11.352 --> 26:12.222
- Fuck.

26:13.615 --> 26:14.485
No.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.663
We wait right here.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.575
- Shit.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.929
- Any of you
motherfuckers bring a map?

27:23.119 --> 27:24.468
This ain't it.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.516
- How the hell we get
so far off course?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.126
- Ran a long way.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.215
- The road to Phong
My should be due east

27:32.389 --> 27:34.522
of our original position, right?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.219
If we cut left
out of that creek,

27:36.393 --> 27:38.569
we should be northwest by
about a klick, if that.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.397
- Maybe.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.444
- Might as well keep truckin'.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.839
Rest of the platoon's
probably already there.

27:47.013 --> 27:47.840
- Yeah.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.278
- Hold up.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.587
I didn't agree to nothin'.

27:56.762 --> 27:59.460
- Ain't nobody said you had to.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.288
- Makes more sense to
head back to the LZ

28:01.462 --> 28:03.029
and wait for extraction.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.422
- Oh, you know where the LZ is?

28:05.596 --> 28:06.989
You wanna lead us there?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.992
- I know it ain't east,
and we're headed east.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.212
I know if there's slopes in
Phong My, we're done for.

28:12.386 --> 28:15.302
It looks to me like we're
headed straight there.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.304
I think you just
wanna find Sutter.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.348
- Hmm.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.004
I think you just want
Sutter to find your ass

28:22.178 --> 28:23.179
and save it.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.704
- They can't be far.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.009
- They ain't lookin'
for you, or me,

28:27.183 --> 28:29.011
or any of us negroes.

28:29.185 --> 28:30.970
They left your ass
to die with us,

28:31.144 --> 28:35.191
and you need to get that
through your motherfuckin' head!

28:35.365 --> 28:36.671
- Lieutenant Sutter's
a good enough officer--

28:36.845 --> 28:39.892
- Ain't no Lieutenant
Sutter no more!

28:40.066 --> 28:41.937
Only a low down,
no-account motherfucker

28:42.111 --> 28:44.679
that left Charlie
balls deep up our ass!

28:44.853 --> 28:47.900
You got fucked,
Meeks, in the ass!

28:48.074 --> 28:49.684
Sutter's prayin' to
every god he can think of

28:49.858 --> 28:54.428
we're all dead, so nobody
knows he left us to die.

28:54.602 --> 28:58.824
He aint' lookin' for you,
so we're lookin' for him.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.218
- You gonna kill him?

29:02.392 --> 29:04.264
- Well, I ain't gonna buy
him an ice cream cone.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.918
You gonna try and hang a
nigga for killin' the man

29:06.092 --> 29:08.224
that fucked you in the ass?

29:08.398 --> 29:10.531
Let me tell you something
Meeks, you in this shit.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.141
You got a target on your back,

29:12.315 --> 29:15.884
and the only thing
savin' your ass right now

29:16.058 --> 29:17.364
is a couple of niggers.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.148
Now, that don't
make you a nigger,

29:19.322 --> 29:20.497
but you gonna walk with niggers,

29:20.671 --> 29:21.890
you gonna talk with niggers,

29:22.064 --> 29:24.327
you gonna eat with niggers.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.724
And you gonna protect niggers
with that pig of yours there,

29:29.898 --> 29:31.770
'cause if you don't, you
gonna lay down in a grave

29:31.944 --> 29:33.119
with a couple of dead niggers.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.207
You got that?

29:42.302 --> 29:44.347
- Whatever you say.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.828
- Good. 'Cause I got two
things to say to you, Meeks.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.831
Number one, get rid of
the fuckin' belt buckle.

29:50.005 --> 29:54.314
And number two, I'm gettin'
tired of being on point.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.588
- Casper, I think
we overshot it.

30:07.762 --> 30:10.330
Phong My couldn't have
been more than a klick out.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.767
We've gone another four by now.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.683
Only thing this far
is a couple of farms.

30:15.857 --> 30:16.945
- We're headed southeast.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.686
If we've gone four klicks,

30:18.860 --> 30:20.514
this'll dump us onto the
east road, somewhere, uh--

30:26.520 --> 30:28.957
- Sounds like friendlies.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.699
- Charlie!

30:33.222 --> 30:35.834
Wake up and smell
the coffee, baby!

30:36.008 --> 30:37.661
You got to the count of

30:37.836 --> 30:39.707
to tell me where your gook
friends are stowing their gear

30:39.881 --> 30:43.058
before one of them uses it
to shoot more of my men.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.104
Where's the stash?

30:47.671 --> 30:49.760
I'm gonna count to 10 now.

30:58.769 --> 31:02.643
Goddamn it, I still can't
learn these fuckin' numbers!

31:02.817 --> 31:05.254
I know for a goddamn fact
you didn't have trouble

31:05.428 --> 31:07.126
findin' those rifles
when this platoon

31:07.300 --> 31:09.171
walked through here
yesterday, did ya?

31:09.345 --> 31:12.131
Well suddenly, you don't
know anything, do ya?

31:13.741 --> 31:15.874
I'm gonna have to
count to 10 now.

31:17.266 --> 31:19.138
No, let's try this.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.185
Ah, English, goddamn it!

31:31.846 --> 31:34.240
Holy Jesus Christ on a cracker,

31:34.414 --> 31:37.417
I just counted to 10 in gook!

31:37.591 --> 31:40.899
Now, I'll read you
the Book of Psalms.

31:41.073 --> 31:43.031
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

31:43.205 --> 31:46.817
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,

31:46.992 --> 31:51.431
as long as I know where those
goddamn weapons are hidden!

31:53.607 --> 31:54.608
- Hey, partner?

31:54.782 --> 31:57.611
- Is this the lost platoon?

31:57.785 --> 31:59.352
Bravo 39th?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.484
- "Lost platoon."

32:01.658 --> 32:03.573
That's what they're
callin' us, huh?

32:03.747 --> 32:05.053
We're with the 39th.

32:05.227 --> 32:07.360
- You Lieutenant Marsh?

32:07.534 --> 32:08.709
- At the hole.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.854
- Hey, LT.

32:24.029 --> 32:24.855
- Yeah.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.988
- You Lieutenant Marsh?

32:29.208 --> 32:30.383
- Yeah.

32:30.557 --> 32:31.253
- Who's askin?

32:31.427 --> 32:32.515
- PFC Allen, sir.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.039
We're with the 60th.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.692
They told us to keep
an eye out for you.

32:35.866 --> 32:38.043
- To keep an eye out?

32:38.217 --> 32:40.871
- They said y'all got lost.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.961
- Do we look lost?

32:46.877 --> 32:48.879
- What's in the hole?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.403
- Three gooks.

32:51.621 --> 32:52.840
And their gook kids.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.798
- You waitin' for
'em to come out?

32:54.973 --> 32:55.886
- Are you serious?

32:56.061 --> 32:56.713
Moss!

32:56.887 --> 32:58.063
Frag me.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.892
- You can't frag civilians.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.720
- They could have guns.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.592
- Look, why don't we just
bring 'em out nice and slow

33:05.766 --> 33:07.159
and see if they know anything?

33:07.333 --> 33:09.726
Private Wake here speaks
a little Vietnamese.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.514
- I don't believe what
I'm hearin' right now.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.125
Please tell me that you're
fuckin' new to this shit,

33:17.299 --> 33:19.780
'cause only a bunch
of fuck-face FNGs

33:19.954 --> 33:21.825
would call a bunch of
gun-totin' mama-sans

33:22.000 --> 33:25.916
and frag-tossin'
baby-sans civilians!

33:26.178 --> 33:27.788
You ever been shot
at by a kid, private?

33:27.962 --> 33:30.138
- Can't say I have.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.620
- They'll shoot you just
as dead as an NVA regular.

33:33.794 --> 33:38.494
- Well, that don't make no
difference to me, or a jury.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.018
- Hey Calhoun, there you are.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.758
Come here, come get
a load of this shit.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.499
- Sir?

33:43.673 --> 33:45.153
- This is my platoon
sergeant, Sergeant Calhoun.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.068
Sergeant, we got a
couple of doves here

33:47.242 --> 33:49.288
who don't wanna frag
the gooks in the hole.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.593
- What?

33:50.767 --> 33:52.030
Why?

33:52.204 --> 33:53.683
- 'Cause they said
it ain't right.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.076
- Huh.

33:55.250 --> 34:00.168
- You ain't fraggin' that hole.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.043
- Let me show you something.

34:15.748 --> 34:16.750
Take a look.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.623
Do you know who those men were?

34:21.797 --> 34:26.107
Private Grant, Private
Cooper and Private Steadwell.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.065
You know why they're dead?

34:28.239 --> 34:31.417
Because some little
gook kid pulled an AK-47

34:31.591 --> 34:34.202
from behind a water
tank and cut 'em down

34:34.376 --> 34:37.292
while they handed out
gum and C-rations.

34:37.466 --> 34:40.382
Pat 'em on the head and tell
them it's okay they're dead

34:40.556 --> 34:45.039
because at least they didn't
hurt some little gook kid.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.956
Hell, you should write their
mothers and their wives

34:50.130 --> 34:53.699
and tell them what good boys
their husbands and sons were.

34:53.873 --> 34:55.614
Rubbing lotion on the bare asses

34:55.789 --> 35:00.707
of a couple baby commie-sans
before they got blown away!

35:00.881 --> 35:03.536
Do you wanna tell them that?

35:06.887 --> 35:10.804
You got anything else
you wanna say to me, boy?

35:13.937 --> 35:16.418
I didn't fuckin' think so.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.639
Assume your positions.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.084
Fire in the hole!

35:36.221 --> 35:37.700
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

35:41.400 --> 35:42.923
- All right, all
right, all right.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.751
Round 'em up, boys.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.105
- What are we doin' here?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.455
- What's it look
like we're doin'?

35:53.629 --> 35:54.848
Let's go, line 'em
up in the field!

35:55.022 --> 35:56.850
- You killin' them folks?

35:57.024 --> 36:00.810
- You either help out or
you stay out of the way.

36:02.290 --> 36:07.165
Listen, gooks knocked my whole
platoon down to a dozen men.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.298
I got half here, half out...

36:10.472 --> 36:12.082
I don't know, God knows where.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.606
Probably dead.

36:14.998 --> 36:18.915
That's 24 dead GIs in
exchange for a dozen gooks.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.048
I'd say they're getting
off pretty fuckin' light.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.572
- That ain't gonna fly, sir.

36:25.661 --> 36:29.317
- Why don't you pick a
fuckin' side, Private?

36:34.104 --> 36:35.105
Hey, fucker.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.717
Make yourself fuckin' useful.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.079
Move!

36:54.951 --> 36:55.691
Let's go!

36:55.865 --> 36:57.563
Move, move, move!

37:01.915 --> 37:02.785
Fuckin' go!

37:06.093 --> 37:07.703
All right, let's go,
on your knees, down!

37:07.877 --> 37:09.879
- Down, down!
- Get down!

37:11.054 --> 37:12.621
All right let's do
it, turn around!

37:12.795 --> 37:14.232
Pull it in, boys.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.846
- On the left, squeeze it in.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.242
On three!

37:24.416 --> 37:25.765
One, two--

37:25.939 --> 37:27.506
- Hold on, shut up.

37:28.985 --> 37:32.598
Listen, everybody say
bravo on three, all right?

37:32.772 --> 37:33.599
- Okay.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.691
One, two, three.

37:38.865 --> 37:39.735
- Bravo!

37:42.695 --> 37:43.565
- Did you get it?

37:43.739 --> 37:45.480
- It ain't balanced right.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.482
- What do you mean, it
ain't balanced right?

37:47.656 --> 37:49.005
- Well, it's all screwy.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.398
You got tall guy over
there on the left,

37:50.572 --> 37:52.182
and it slopes down on the right.

37:52.357 --> 37:55.751
- Montrabe, move it
down a couple spaces.

37:57.231 --> 37:59.538
- Still a little unbalanced.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.757
- For God's sakes, just
take the fuckin' picture.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.238
- No, hold on, I'll move up.

38:06.719 --> 38:07.720
That better?

38:08.677 --> 38:10.113
- Dandy.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.680
- Why don't y'all grab
one of them mama-sans

38:11.854 --> 38:14.335
and drag her into the picture?

38:16.642 --> 38:18.513
- Why the hell would we do that?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.385
- Like a trophy, you know?

38:20.559 --> 38:22.778
Like you just went on a safari
and took down a giraffe,

38:22.952 --> 38:25.041
only it's a Vietnamese giraffe.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.043
- Just take the fuckin' picture!

38:27.217 --> 38:28.088
- Hold on.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.656
I kinda like that.

38:31.613 --> 38:32.440
Yeah.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.747
Hey, come here, honey.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.358
Right here.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.055
No, it's okay, shh, it's okay.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.622
No, right here.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.232
Yeah, smile for the
camera, sweetheart.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.712
- All right.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.760
One, two, three.

38:47.934 --> 38:48.804
- Bravo!

38:52.504 --> 38:53.853
- Let's go.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.115
All right.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.727
Light 'em up boys, on three!

38:58.901 --> 39:00.294
One!

39:01.251 --> 39:02.122
Two!

39:03.950 --> 39:05.386
Three--

39:24.144 --> 39:25.798
- You just killed them,
you motherfuckin' nigger!

39:25.972 --> 39:28.409
- Time to calm down!

39:31.978 --> 39:33.240
- You gonna shoot me too?

39:33.414 --> 39:34.763
- I will if you don't calm down,

39:34.937 --> 39:37.418
and take a couple of
big steps backwards.

39:37.592 --> 39:40.334
- Drop it, PFC!

39:40.508 --> 39:41.509
- Okay Joe,
you need to calm down--

39:41.683 --> 39:44.033
- I said, drop it.

39:54.870 --> 39:55.871
- All right.

40:08.188 --> 40:09.755
Tell you what, Joe.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.496
First, you tell me what
you think the problem is,

40:11.670 --> 40:12.671
and then I'll tell you what
I think the problem is.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.063
- No, fuck you!

40:14.847 --> 40:17.719
You just shot US Army soldiers!

40:19.286 --> 40:22.028
- Okay, so what's the problem?

40:25.205 --> 40:26.772
- They're all dead.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.515
They're all fuckin' dead.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.778
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

40:32.952 --> 40:34.997
I should shoot you right now!

40:35.171 --> 40:36.346
- You gonna shoot
your own brother?

40:36.521 --> 40:38.131
- Fuck you!

40:38.305 --> 40:42.178
They're gonna put yo ass
in front of a firing squad.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.183
- Let me ask you something, Joe.

40:47.357 --> 40:48.837
You got a dog?

40:49.011 --> 40:50.273
- What?

40:50.448 --> 40:51.753
- A dog, back home,
you got a dog?

40:51.927 --> 40:53.451
- Yeah, so what?

40:53.625 --> 40:54.582
- Your dog like you?

40:54.756 --> 40:55.540
- Yeah.

40:55.714 --> 40:56.628
- You like your dog?

40:56.802 --> 40:58.325
- Yeah, what's your point?

40:58.499 --> 40:59.326
- So you and your dog
protect each other, right?

40:59.500 --> 41:00.893
You feed him and he barks

41:01.067 --> 41:02.460
if somebody tries to
come into your house.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.200
- Yeah, get the fuck
on with it, Casper.

41:04.374 --> 41:07.290
- So you loyal to your dog
and your dog loyal to you.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.596
- Yeah.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.293
I don't shoot him.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.817
- Let me ask you somethin'.

41:11.991 --> 41:13.253
One day, you walk
out of your house

41:13.427 --> 41:14.994
and your dog loses
his fuckin' mind

41:15.168 --> 41:17.170
and latches on to little
neighbor Sally's arm

41:17.344 --> 41:19.172
and starts tearin'
out chunks of flesh.

41:19.346 --> 41:20.608
What do you do?

41:20.782 --> 41:21.870
- My dog's trained
not to do that.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.263
- Yeah.

41:23.437 --> 41:24.917
99% of dogs are
trained not to do that.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.701
But if you got the
one that does anyway,

41:26.875 --> 41:28.268
what are you gonna
do when he starts

41:28.442 --> 41:30.096
rippin' off the little
neighbor girl's arm?

41:30.270 --> 41:32.490
You gonna stand by and let
him maul a little girl,

41:32.664 --> 41:34.361
just 'cause he's your dog?

41:34.535 --> 41:35.797
You gonna toss him a biscuit,
or you gonna put him down?

41:35.971 --> 41:37.364
- That's not
the same thing!

41:37.538 --> 41:40.672
- It's the exact same
fuckin' thing, Joe!

41:42.630 --> 41:44.371
And you need to get that
through your fuckin' head.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.460
Now I know you freaked out
about what just went down,

41:46.634 --> 41:48.767
but at the end of the day,
we're all in this shit together.

41:48.941 --> 41:49.724
- Together?

41:49.898 --> 41:50.812
What side are you on?

41:50.986 --> 41:52.901
- There ain't no sides, Joe!

41:53.075 --> 41:55.295
Havin' stripes on your shirt
don't make you the good guy.

41:55.469 --> 41:56.949
Singin' the Star Spangled Banner

41:57.123 --> 41:58.733
don't make you the good guy.

41:58.907 --> 42:02.476
The only difference between
good guys and bad guys out here

42:02.650 --> 42:04.478
is what kind of code
you dealin' with.

42:04.652 --> 42:07.133
How many good guys you know
out there killin' kids, Joe?

42:07.307 --> 42:08.656
If Command found
out them good guys

42:08.830 --> 42:10.963
shot all those
civilians, we'd all hang.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.878
Hell, we fucked, Joe!

42:13.052 --> 42:15.271
We gonna hang anyway
for killin' them GIs.

42:15.445 --> 42:18.448
The only difference is
lettin' them children die

42:18.623 --> 42:21.451
would keep you up
longer at night.

42:28.807 --> 42:32.027
We are the good guys, Joe.

42:37.511 --> 42:38.381
- Man.

42:39.687 --> 42:42.429
I can't argue with
that, fuck those guys.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.083
- Your bullets in 'em, Meeks.

42:44.257 --> 42:46.128
You can't say shit.

42:47.303 --> 42:48.522
- So what?

42:50.045 --> 42:51.743
So we just gonna hop
a chopper back to base

42:51.917 --> 42:53.962
and tell everyone that Private
Casper went all ape-shit

42:54.136 --> 42:55.877
on the missing platoon?

42:56.051 --> 42:58.401
Hope they just laugh it off?

42:58.576 --> 43:02.188
- Nope, we ain't
gonna say a thing.

43:02.362 --> 43:03.711
We got separated
from the platoon

43:03.885 --> 43:05.931
and found our way
back to Phong Nam.

43:06.105 --> 43:10.326
Made our way back to the
LZ and that's all we know.

43:11.197 --> 43:12.807
You good with that?

43:12.981 --> 43:15.114
Or you want to stand up against
a wall for havin' some honor

43:15.288 --> 43:17.420
and savin' some kids' lives?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.393
- Yeah.

43:35.134 --> 43:36.222
I'm good with that.

43:36.396 --> 43:38.006
- How about you, Felix?

43:38.180 --> 43:40.530
You okay not standin' up against
a wall for those shitheads?

43:41.923 --> 43:42.924
- Fine by me.

43:43.838 --> 43:46.711
- You gonna try some bullshit?

43:50.540 --> 43:51.803
- Nah.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.068
Let's just get back.

44:11.039 --> 44:14.347
- Good news is, platoon
sergeant had a map.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.006
- You know what?

44:23.008 --> 44:25.575
I think I figured out
why they call you Casper.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.969
- That ain't my name.

44:28.143 --> 44:29.449
- I'm guessin' it's
'cause you turn

44:29.623 --> 44:32.582
red-blooded American
boys into ghosts.

44:32.757 --> 44:33.322
Right?

44:33.496 --> 44:35.020
- Not quite.

44:35.194 --> 44:36.151
It's 'cause I shot a
little white motherfucker

44:36.325 --> 44:38.153
named Casper and took his name.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.591
That's what we do in my culture.

44:41.766 --> 44:43.158
- Is that right?

44:43.332 --> 44:45.204
- He got it in recruit training.

44:45.378 --> 44:49.121
Drill instructor gave
it to him and it stuck.

44:49.295 --> 44:51.950
- It was dumb, it
ain't even a name.

44:52.124 --> 44:54.648
- Whittaker used
to tell it best.

44:54.822 --> 44:57.172
So drill instructor walks
in on ol' Private Allen here

44:57.346 --> 45:01.829
all conked out up on his
locker but during fire watch.

45:02.003 --> 45:04.266
DI walks over to him and
punches him right in the chest.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.877
Boom!

45:06.051 --> 45:08.270
He says, "You're dead, Private."

45:08.444 --> 45:10.316
And he tells him, "Well,
since you're dead,

45:10.490 --> 45:12.492
"you gotta be dead."

45:12.666 --> 45:14.276
So he makes him wear
this giant white sheet

45:14.450 --> 45:16.322
for the rest of the night, he's
gotta go around and wake up

45:16.496 --> 45:20.500
all the other recruits
goin', "Boo, I'm a ghost!"

45:20.674 --> 45:22.284
- Ain't that ironic?

45:22.458 --> 45:23.677
- It's fuckin' stupid.

45:23.851 --> 45:25.026
- It stuck, though.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.681
He's been Casper ever since.

45:27.855 --> 45:30.162
- I can see the resemblance.

45:31.424 --> 45:33.643
- Nobody gave you a
nickname in basic?

45:33.818 --> 45:35.515
I was Private Jesus.

46:01.759 --> 46:02.629
- Come on.

46:11.943 --> 46:13.596
- What village is this?

46:13.771 --> 46:15.207
- I don't know, it
ain't on the map.

46:15.381 --> 46:16.861
- M16, friendlies.

46:19.515 --> 46:20.473
- Lieutenant Marsh
said he got cut off

46:20.647 --> 46:22.127
from half his platoon.

46:22.301 --> 46:23.606
Might be them.

46:24.607 --> 46:25.565
- Maybe.

46:26.348 --> 46:27.349
- Hey.

46:28.394 --> 46:30.222
Maybe we oughta let this one go.

46:31.179 --> 46:32.746
- "Let it go."

46:32.920 --> 46:34.226
It already got us.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.663
- All right boys, round 'em up.

46:36.837 --> 46:38.099
Move it, go on.

46:38.273 --> 46:41.929
Come on, round 'em up, boys.

46:42.103 --> 46:44.758
Come on, get 'em outta
there, get 'em out.

46:44.932 --> 46:45.846
- Let's go, get out!

46:46.020 --> 46:47.369
Come on!

46:49.589 --> 46:51.243
- Left side's clear.

46:54.246 --> 46:57.118
Contact, last hooch!

46:57.292 --> 46:59.947
- Get 'em up, get 'em up!

47:03.255 --> 47:05.083
- All right, we got a
couple more in here.

47:05.257 --> 47:06.301
We goin' in, Sarge?

47:06.475 --> 47:07.259
- Hell no.

47:07.433 --> 47:08.826
Smoke it, Leland.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.617
- Bravo Company, rest
of the lost platoon.

47:17.791 --> 47:20.489
- This ain't our fight.

47:20.663 --> 47:22.578
This ain't our fight,
come on, let's go.

47:22.752 --> 47:26.147
- Yeah, we're
already in deep enough shit.

47:26.321 --> 47:27.714
- Then what have we got to lose?

47:27.888 --> 47:28.715
- All right, let's go.

47:31.761 --> 47:33.938
Let's go, come on, come on.

47:37.289 --> 47:38.681
- Ain't no good gonna
come out of stayin'.

47:38.856 --> 47:39.726
Let's go!

47:41.641 --> 47:43.164
- Come on, little mama.

47:43.338 --> 47:44.731
Ain't so bad.

47:44.905 --> 47:47.168
- What do you think?

47:47.342 --> 47:49.083
Maybe we ought to
leave the lady.

47:49.257 --> 47:50.998
The bitch probably deserves it.

47:51.172 --> 47:53.000
Yeah, he'll probably shoot
her when he's done too.

47:53.174 --> 47:54.436
You good with that?

47:54.610 --> 47:56.308
- He's good with that!

47:56.482 --> 47:58.571
We all are, let's go!

48:00.355 --> 48:01.661
- So it's just a damn
peep show now, huh?

48:01.835 --> 48:03.706
You want me to go
get you some tissues?

48:03.881 --> 48:04.794
Look at him gettin' her.

48:04.969 --> 48:06.187
Yeah, see?

48:06.361 --> 48:07.972
That's the shit
I'm talkin' about.

48:08.146 --> 48:09.451
Good guys.

48:09.625 --> 48:10.931
Good guys, Joe.

48:15.805 --> 48:16.676
- Hey!

48:18.808 --> 48:19.679
Hey!

48:21.681 --> 48:24.553
Back off, let her go, now!

48:26.773 --> 48:28.209
- Who the hell are you?

48:28.383 --> 48:29.471
- Let her go.

48:32.387 --> 48:33.345
- You from Second Platoon?

48:33.519 --> 48:34.650
- I'm not from any platoon.

48:34.824 --> 48:35.825
Now get outta here.

48:40.700 --> 48:43.746
- RTO just got the radio fixed.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.184
Callin' in our
position right now.

48:46.358 --> 48:50.318
- Get back in there
and finish your sweep.

48:50.492 --> 48:52.320
- This is the sweep.

48:58.761 --> 49:00.024
- Leave it.

49:00.198 --> 49:01.547
- There's gooks everywhere.

49:01.721 --> 49:03.418
- I don't care!

49:03.592 --> 49:05.594
- I'm just gonna pick it up,

49:05.768 --> 49:08.336
and carry it right
back over there.

49:08.510 --> 49:09.337
All right?

49:13.037 --> 49:13.907
Nice.

49:14.777 --> 49:15.561
Slow.

49:15.735 --> 49:17.171
- Clear the chamber.

49:17.345 --> 49:18.694
- Nice and slow.

49:20.261 --> 49:21.088
Nice...

49:22.916 --> 49:24.091
And slow.

49:24.265 --> 49:25.049
- Clear the chamber!

49:34.754 --> 49:38.062
- Hey!

49:39.237 --> 49:40.238
- Here we go.

50:12.139 --> 50:13.793
- Eight niner bravo, friendly
fire, taking friendly fire!

50:13.967 --> 50:15.229
Niner bravo, rogue friendlies,

50:15.403 --> 50:16.578
three or four rogue friendlies!

50:16.752 --> 50:18.450
All negroes!

50:18.624 --> 50:19.799
We got a half a platoon
down, request immediate evac!

50:19.973 --> 50:22.323
Zero niner five
to six niner six--

50:25.326 --> 50:26.806
- Jesus Christ.

50:34.596 --> 50:35.815
- You know they're
gonna put our asses

50:35.989 --> 50:38.252
against the wall, right?

50:39.123 --> 50:40.863
- Took us about 10 minutes
to set a world record

50:41.038 --> 50:42.952
for fraggin' our own guys.

50:43.127 --> 50:45.520
- They weren't our own guys.

50:45.694 --> 50:49.176
Our own guys don't
pull that kinda shit.

50:49.350 --> 50:51.483
- Sutter really fucked us.

50:53.267 --> 50:55.791
- No other way about it.

50:56.749 --> 50:58.881
I give it three hours
before a bunch of Cobras

50:59.056 --> 51:00.361
come sweepin' this place,

51:00.535 --> 51:03.973
lookin' to put our
asses in the grass.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.498
- We gonna shoot them down too?

51:06.672 --> 51:10.023
- We did what we had
to do, with no choice.

51:10.197 --> 51:11.503
Don't go gettin' all
twisted up over it.

51:20.512 --> 51:21.817
Perimeter, now!

51:34.526 --> 51:35.831
- It's clear.

51:36.005 --> 51:38.095
- We can't stay here.

51:39.835 --> 51:41.141
Casper, we can't
sit around out here

51:41.315 --> 51:42.795
waitin' to get shot, man!

51:43.578 --> 51:46.407
- I ain't tryin' to get
shot by no firing squad.

51:46.581 --> 51:49.367
Every one of them boys is white.

51:49.541 --> 51:51.543
What, you think they gonna
stand a couple of negroes up

51:51.717 --> 51:53.893
and take a moral
crisis into account?

51:54.067 --> 51:55.155
Hell nah.

51:55.329 --> 51:56.287
- I get that.

51:56.461 --> 51:58.158
But we gonna die out here too.

51:58.332 --> 52:00.595
How long you think we're
gonna last in this shit?

52:00.769 --> 52:03.642
- I'd rather die out
here than back there.

52:03.816 --> 52:08.168
Shit, I ain't gettin' railroaded
for stoppin' a murder.

52:08.342 --> 52:09.865
- We might still have a chance.

52:10.039 --> 52:11.432
This war's not too
popular right now.

52:11.606 --> 52:12.999
The press'll be all over it.

52:13.173 --> 52:15.741
- Course they will,
and that's exactly why

52:15.915 --> 52:18.483
they gonna put us
away, nice and quiet.

52:18.657 --> 52:21.225
Somebody will roll a frag into
the cell and call it a day,

52:21.399 --> 52:25.272
if they don't shoot our
black asses on sight.

52:25.446 --> 52:27.056
- What if we shoot them first?

52:27.231 --> 52:29.146
- Shoot who first?

52:31.887 --> 52:33.541
- Sutter.

52:33.715 --> 52:35.630
- Joe-Joe, well you got
hard real quick, didn't you?

52:35.804 --> 52:38.285
- Everything that happened,
both those villages,

52:38.459 --> 52:40.548
we found them because
Sutter bailed on our asses

52:40.722 --> 52:42.333
and left us for dead.

52:42.507 --> 52:43.856
- So we just gonna fuck
his shit up, and then what?

52:44.030 --> 52:45.074
Go wait back at the LZ?

52:45.249 --> 52:47.120
- You got a better idea?

52:47.294 --> 52:50.515
- Now look, I told
you there is a code.

52:51.516 --> 52:53.300
I didn't kill no
guys for revenge,

52:53.474 --> 52:54.693
or 'cause they
called me a nigger,

52:54.867 --> 52:56.738
or-or any of that nonsense.

52:56.912 --> 52:59.567
That was defense
of non-combatants.

52:59.741 --> 53:01.874
Women and children.

53:02.048 --> 53:04.877
Now, I stand by
that, but Sutter?

53:05.051 --> 53:08.185
Now, that's a whole
'nother ball game.

53:09.795 --> 53:12.276
- Where the hell is Meeks?

53:17.237 --> 53:18.891
- Where'd the bike go?

53:19.065 --> 53:21.894
- He's gonna try and make
it to the LZ for extraction,

53:22.068 --> 53:25.637
and tell some bullshit about
gettin' separated from us.

53:25.811 --> 53:27.421
Never knew nothin'
about anything.

53:27.595 --> 53:29.162
- Gotta beat him there, then.

53:29.336 --> 53:30.207
- We ain't got no bikes.

53:30.381 --> 53:32.296
What, you wanna run?

53:33.122 --> 53:35.473
- We don't need bikes.

53:35.647 --> 53:36.865
We need a boat.

54:39.537 --> 54:40.842
- That stupid motherfucker.

54:41.016 --> 54:43.062
If we were Charlie,
he'd be dead meat.

54:44.585 --> 54:45.978
- So we just gonna camp here?

54:46.152 --> 54:47.980
- Man, hell no.

54:48.154 --> 54:49.503
Let's keep moving upstream.

54:49.677 --> 54:52.071
- Nah, they'll see us.

54:52.245 --> 54:53.551
We wait right here.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.305
- Ready?

55:15.268 --> 55:16.922
- We truckin'?

55:19.577 --> 55:20.491
Why don't you just hit the motor

55:20.665 --> 55:22.406
so we can get up outta here?

55:22.580 --> 55:24.495
I know you ain't havin'
a goddamn moral crisis

55:24.669 --> 55:26.235
over that asshole.

55:27.062 --> 55:29.151
Man, you think he'd
come back for us?

55:29.326 --> 55:30.414
Kick it, Joe.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.200
- He's on our side.

55:34.374 --> 55:35.723
- "He's on our side."

55:35.897 --> 55:38.552
- You in the Army, ain't you?

55:40.075 --> 55:41.555
- He's right.

55:43.165 --> 55:44.776
He had our backs earlier.

55:44.950 --> 55:47.126
- Army gonna fuck us
with or without him.

55:47.300 --> 55:50.259
Might as well bring
him along to the party.

55:50.434 --> 55:52.610
- Guy bails on our asses.

55:52.784 --> 55:54.612
Calls you a nigger.

55:56.222 --> 55:58.224
- I am a nigger.

55:58.398 --> 56:00.182
But I ain't Meeks.

56:04.056 --> 56:04.926
You in?

56:08.060 --> 56:08.930
- I'm in.

56:13.108 --> 56:15.284
- All right man, what we doin'?

56:22.161 --> 56:23.510
- You know if you
don't let me go,

56:23.684 --> 56:25.817
you gonna have about 200
fuckin' US Army soldiers

56:25.991 --> 56:27.688
up here in the morning, right?

56:32.606 --> 56:34.260
Fuck!

56:34.434 --> 56:38.569
Oh you fuckin' piss dick,
no good, slope motherfucker!

56:39.831 --> 56:42.399
Keep laughin' with that big gun!

56:42.573 --> 56:45.271
Your village is gonna go
up in flames, motherfucker!

56:47.012 --> 56:49.275
I can't wait to see you cry.

56:50.885 --> 56:52.583
I can't wait to watch
you burn, motherfucker!

56:52.757 --> 56:55.194
I'm gonna watch the skin fall
off your fuckin' skeleton,

56:55.368 --> 56:57.326
you piece of shit!

56:58.284 --> 57:00.373
Why don't you come
on up to Jackson?

57:00.547 --> 57:02.680
I'll show you how a white
man treats a fuckin' nip,

57:02.854 --> 57:04.638
you piece of shit!

57:04.812 --> 57:05.987
Fuck!

57:06.161 --> 57:07.032
Shit!

57:27.052 --> 57:28.793
Move!

58:02.957 --> 58:04.959
- How'd y'all find me?

58:05.133 --> 58:08.659
- Wasn't hard with you floppin'
around up on that bike.

58:08.833 --> 58:11.400
- Goddamn fuckin' slopes.

58:11.575 --> 58:14.055
They were gonna skin me alive.

58:16.928 --> 58:20.714
- You wanna tell me why
the fuck you took off?

58:21.846 --> 58:23.195
- Didn't have much of a choice.

58:23.369 --> 58:25.284
- That so?

58:26.546 --> 58:28.548
- Die in the weeds with y'all,

58:28.722 --> 58:31.856
die at the base after a
good meal and a hot shower.

58:32.030 --> 58:35.250
- Sounds like you
just fixin' to die.

58:37.296 --> 58:39.690
- You gonna shoot me,
you probably oughta wait

58:39.864 --> 58:42.519
until I give you your
ticket out of this shit.

58:42.693 --> 58:45.173
- What are you talking about?

58:45.347 --> 58:47.828
- Oh, don't want to
shoot me now, huh?

58:48.002 --> 58:49.613
- Shut the fuck up.

58:49.787 --> 58:52.964
What are you talking about,
ticket out of this shit?

58:53.138 --> 58:54.792
- How 'bout you gettin' the
hardware out of my face?

59:00.145 --> 59:01.276
- What ticket?

59:03.365 --> 59:04.453
- Slopes dragged me
inside one of those huts

59:04.628 --> 59:06.325
when they first got me.

59:06.499 --> 59:08.501
They had a radio operator
in there picking up traffic

59:08.675 --> 59:11.112
from the rest of the company.

59:12.549 --> 59:15.552
One came over the wire saying
he found a dozen dead GIs

59:15.726 --> 59:19.556
in a line a few klicks
east of Phong Nam.

59:19.730 --> 59:21.645
Guess who called it in.

59:22.471 --> 59:23.516
- Sutter.

59:23.690 --> 59:25.518
- Loud and clear.

59:25.692 --> 59:29.087
Fourth Platoon found 'em
hours after we were there.

59:29.261 --> 59:30.305
Our platoon.

59:31.045 --> 59:32.003
Us.

59:33.134 --> 59:34.571
- They try to pin it on us,

59:34.745 --> 59:36.573
Sutter gotta tell
everyone he bailed on us.

59:36.747 --> 59:39.271
- And if he decides to cut
his losses and 'fess up?

59:39.445 --> 59:41.360
We got an alibi.

59:41.534 --> 59:42.491
We've been pinned
down by Charlie

59:42.666 --> 59:43.841
since three in the afternoon,

59:44.015 --> 59:46.408
downriver where
we sink this boat.

59:46.583 --> 59:50.891
Sutter ditched us, so we
cut south, trying to evade.

59:52.371 --> 59:55.026
Never got anywhere
near that village.

59:55.200 --> 59:57.768
LT and the boys become
the prime suspects.

59:58.551 --> 01:00:00.553
- You think it'll stick?

01:00:00.727 --> 01:00:01.989
- Only proof they got
we were ever there

01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:04.209
was that lieutenant's camera.

01:00:04.383 --> 01:00:05.819
- Motherfuck!

01:00:05.993 --> 01:00:08.300
That camera's got
everything on it!

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:09.954
- So what happens if
they find the camera

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.652
and they see the lost
platoon cheesin' on it?

01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.394
How do you know we're not
in any of those pictures?

01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:17.352
- These pictures?

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:20.007
- Goddamn.

01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:25.143
- Just gotta beat
Sutter back to the LZ,

01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:27.449
and we're home free.

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:31.410
- That's some good shit.

01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:36.589
- We square?

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:40.245
- We square.

01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:42.900
- Major?
- Sir?

01:00:43.074 --> 01:00:45.076
- Something screwy here.

01:00:46.773 --> 01:00:49.558
Bravo's Fourth Platoon
made contact here,

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.126
a klick past Phong Nam.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.173
Backs up two klicks west,
then goes back up again

01:00:55.347 --> 01:00:57.523
and runs into fresh bodies.

01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:58.872
Now why'd they go
through an area

01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:01.745
they'd just been ambushed in?

01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:04.008
- You think they're lying?

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:05.923
- That radio call
from Bravo Fourth

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:09.230
came in three hours after
Alpha Company's missing platoon

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:12.190
radioed that they
were being attacked.

01:01:12.364 --> 01:01:13.974
- Rogue platoon?

01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:15.759
- Or two.

01:01:15.933 --> 01:01:18.283
Something isn't addin' up.

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:19.806
- The rest of Bravo
Company's fanned out

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.503
across that peninsula.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.071
- And they should be right
up each other's asses,

01:01:24.245 --> 01:01:28.249
but Fourth Platoon's off by
about two klicks northeast.

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:29.903
- Beats me, sir.

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.864
- How many birds we got
comin' in for the extract?

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:35.300
- 11 for Bravo, sir.

01:01:35.474 --> 01:01:36.562
- Can you get an extra on deck?

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.390
- Yes, sir.

01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:40.087
- Good.

01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:43.003
I want two gunships
accompanying that extract.

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:46.311
I want a company sweepin'
that peninsula at first light

01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:48.661
and I want two squads
at each kill site

01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:51.969
and cover every inch of
that delta in between.

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:53.710
- I'll take care of it, sir.

01:01:53.884 --> 01:01:57.452
- And Major, clear a seat
on that first bird out.

01:01:57.626 --> 01:01:58.540
I'll be on it.

01:02:05.678 --> 01:02:08.289
- We what, two klicks out?

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.815
- If that, LZ's
right up the road.

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:13.425
- 0700?

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:14.643
- We got an hour and a
half if we want a shot

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:15.949
at the first bird out.

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:19.170
- You think everybody's
heard about what happened?

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:21.128
- Probably.

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.696
If it was on the radio, every
platoon leader knows about it.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.090
I'm thinkin' we better avoid
the rest of the company

01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:27.918
until the birds
are on the ground.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:30.007
Stake a spot on the perimeter
and catch one comin' in.

01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:31.748
- What about the gunner?

01:02:31.922 --> 01:02:33.706
- What about him?

01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:37.362
- Them Huey's got a door gunner.

01:02:37.536 --> 01:02:39.581
Radio operator in
Giong Trom said

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.367
a couple negroes went rogue.

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.064
You think they might
be on the lookout

01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:47.024
for a couple of negroes
runnin' straight for a chopper?

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:50.070
- Maybe we oughta just
blend in with the platoon?

01:02:50.244 --> 01:02:51.637
- Yeah, stick to the story,

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:53.465
and act like we don't
know what happened.

01:02:53.639 --> 01:02:56.598
- Sutter gonna shoot us on
sight and ask questions later.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.253
Door gunner gonna cut us
down if we look at him funny.

01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:01.342
- So we're fucked?

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:04.606
- Not if they don't see us.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.304
- How they not gonna see us?

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:09.698
What, we gonna go Casper again?

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:13.398
- They ain't gonna see us,
'cause they ain't gonna find us.

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:14.834
We wanna pass this
whole thing off,

01:03:15.008 --> 01:03:17.706
then we gotta play
it all the way.

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.797
VC caught our asses and we
didn't make it to the LZ.

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.625
They held us a couple of
days until we busted out,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.323
killed a couple of guards,

01:03:25.497 --> 01:03:27.281
and then show up at
Command at Saigon

01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:31.242
with a couple AK-47s and
a motherfucker of a story.

01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:34.854
Maybe some nice intel on VC
movements south of Ben Tre.

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.030
And pissed the fuck off
at our platoon leader

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:40.468
who bailed on our asses in
the midst of a firefight.

01:03:40.642 --> 01:03:42.993
Pissed the fuck off
at a guy who's already

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:45.604
gonna be under suspicion
for calling in a kill site

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:48.346
when he was the only one there.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.783
That's how we gonna end this.

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:52.524
We dig a fuckin' hole, cover it,

01:03:52.698 --> 01:03:55.092
and hide out for three
days, maybe four.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:56.658
If we survive those
couple of days,

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.096
we hump the 50 klicks
back up to Saigon,

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.097
and we got an alibi.

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:01.925
No choppers, nothin'.

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:04.841
Just a ticket outta this shit.

01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:06.886
- I can dig a hole.

01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:09.584
- Damn it, man.

01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:11.195
All right, I'm in.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.197
- Meeks, what about--

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:15.895
What the fuck are you doing?

01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:18.855
- You were right
about one thing.

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:20.944
They ain't gonna find you.

01:04:21.118 --> 01:04:23.163
- Meeks, come on, just...

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:25.905
Put that thing down.

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:28.299
- I been doin' a little
bit of thinkin' here.

01:04:28.473 --> 01:04:30.083
Turns out, this
whole goddamn thing

01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.172
is y'alls fuckin' fault
in the first place.

01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:33.608
- Our fault?

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:35.523
You got blood on your hands too!

01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:37.874
- I didn't have much of a
fuckin' choice, now did I?

01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:39.876
- Meeks, come on man, you
ain't thinkin' straight.

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:42.226
We just saved your
ass back there.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.488
- Yeah.

01:04:44.315 --> 01:04:45.794
Yeah, you did.

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.753
You know why?

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:51.322
'Cause you got my ass captured
by the fuckin' slopes.

01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:53.977
'Cause you greased
a squad of GIs.

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:55.630
But that wasn't enough.

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:58.329
Then you went and
greased a second one.

01:04:58.503 --> 01:04:59.765
All I done this whole time

01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.245
is react to you
killin' friendlies.

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:02.724
- So you gonna kill three more?

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.204
- Fuck you!

01:05:04.378 --> 01:05:05.684
Stand up, all of you.

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:06.946
Don't even look at them rifles.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:07.947
Go on.

01:05:08.817 --> 01:05:09.688
Go on!

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.519
Stand the fuck up, Casper.

01:05:17.522 --> 01:05:20.525
Now toss 'em in the
water, nice and slow.

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.226
Toss the fuckin' rifles
in the fuckin' water,

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.532
or I'll end you.

01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:38.369
Now helmets, toss your
helmets in the water.

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.899
You tie a good knot, boy.

01:05:47.073 --> 01:05:48.814
Why don't you go
on and sit down?

01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:58.084
- What, you want me
to tie my hands too?

01:05:58.258 --> 01:06:00.739
- Nah, I got that.

01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:13.578
- Sutter left your ass for
dead, and he'd do it again!

01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.323
- Sutter survived.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:22.326
So will I.

01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:27.984
- LZ Echo sir, coming up.

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:35.948
- Nobody home?

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:39.996
- No smoke, sir.

01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:43.695
You want me to put her down?

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:45.131
- Negative.

01:06:45.305 --> 01:06:46.828
Other birds will
make the extract.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.569
Keep headin' east.

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.443
We're lookin' for
a couple of rogues.

01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:07.257
- Mornin'.

01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:08.693
- Jesus Christ.

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:12.479
What the hell are you poppin'
out of the bush like that for?

01:08:12.653 --> 01:08:14.786
We could have shot you!

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:19.312
- Wouldn't that be
a fuckin' tragedy?

01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.488
- What happened?

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:25.884
Is it just you?

01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:27.712
Okay.

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:33.848
You uh, hear about those
dead GIs back in Giong Trom?

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:37.330
- Nah.

01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:39.158
- Nah?

01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:42.988
Yeah, a couple of crazy
assholes wiped out a few squads

01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:45.077
in two different villages.

01:08:45.251 --> 01:08:48.124
And word is, they were American.

01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:51.344
- Is that right?

01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:54.652
- Yeah, well, that's
the word, anyway.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:58.612
You know, the only problem is,

01:08:58.786 --> 01:09:01.920
everyone deployed in operations
has been accounted for.

01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:03.617
I mean everyone...

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:05.924
Except you.

01:09:10.233 --> 01:09:11.582
- Oh.

01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:14.062
That's a funny story.

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.760
I got one for you.

01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:18.023
Chickenshit platoon
leader takes off

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:19.720
in the middle of a firefight

01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:22.332
and leaves a cut off fire
team to die in the shit.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.682
Shoots up a bunch of
villagers on the way back,

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:26.988
gets surprised by
the missing platoon,

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.033
and kills 'em to
bury the evidence.

01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:33.734
- Huh.

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:39.957
Well, now I didn't say
anything about any villagers.

01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:44.223
It was you, wasn't it?

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.880
- Everything that happened to
me happened because of you.

01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:50.577
- Okay.

01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:51.839
Okay.

01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.061
Tell you what?

01:09:56.235 --> 01:09:58.933
Why don't you point that
pig that way and you and I,

01:09:59.107 --> 01:10:00.326
we can discuss this?

01:10:01.414 --> 01:10:03.155
- Hmm.

01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:05.026
Why don't you give me one good
reason not to smoke your ass

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.419
where you stand?

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:07.594
- How about because
you'll be dead

01:10:07.768 --> 01:10:09.509
before you get a
second shot off?

01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.032
And honestly, Meeks, I don't
think you wanna end your life

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.425
out here in the shit.

01:10:12.599 --> 01:10:14.471
So get your fuckin'
head straight!

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:18.344
- LT, I'm already dead.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.912
- No.

01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:23.784
You don't have to be, Meeks.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:26.309
You don't have to be.

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:28.615
Let me ask you a question.

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:30.835
Where are those other
boys you were with?

01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:32.228
- Gone.

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:33.707
- Dead?

01:10:33.881 --> 01:10:35.187
- Maybe.

01:10:37.668 --> 01:10:38.582
- Captured?

01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:40.323
- Probably.

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:45.284
- All right, then let
tell you something.

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:47.504
Leading a platoon ain't easy.

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:49.680
Sometimes you have to
make the tough choices,

01:10:49.854 --> 01:10:51.638
like leaving a few
men in order to save

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:53.727
the whole goddamn unit.

01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:59.255
But Meeks, that doesn't mean
I can't try to have your back.

01:11:00.691 --> 01:11:02.823
- It's a little late for that.

01:11:03.215 --> 01:11:05.696
- It doesn't have to be.

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.741
Not necessarily.

01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:10.135
Those choppers are gonna
be here in a half an hour,

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:11.615
and everyone in this platoon

01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:13.747
is gonna be on those
choppers, together.

01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:15.488
Just like we came off.

01:11:15.662 --> 01:11:18.535
Just like we've been
the entire time.

01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:20.537
All of us, Meeks, together.

01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:21.799
Do you...

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:25.846
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

01:11:28.414 --> 01:11:29.546
- So what, you think they're
just gonna forget about

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.199
two dozen dead friendlies?

01:11:32.636 --> 01:11:33.724
- Casper.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:37.293
It was Casper, wasn't it?

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.819
Sure.

01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:43.255
Sure, he fired the first shot,

01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:45.039
and those other
fucking negro boys,

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:46.824
well, they followed right
along with him, didn't they?

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:51.437
I mean, that is, that is
what happened, right Meeks?

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:53.483
Huh?

01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:56.877
- It's still your fault.

01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:59.402
- Shit happens.

01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:02.709
Especially out here.

01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:07.627
Doesn't mean it has
to happen to you.

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:15.635
- Why'd you tie these ropes
so motherfuckin' tight?

01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.942
- So I wouldn't get shot.

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:22.947
- We ain't gettin'
out these ropes.

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:24.949
- Well, I ain't
layin' here sunbathin!

01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:42.793
- Choppers inbound, step on it.

01:12:56.154 --> 01:12:57.503
- There they are.

01:12:57.677 --> 01:12:58.939
Put it down by the road.

01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:00.463
- Roger that.

01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:09.559
- Lieutenant
Sutter, Bravo Company!

01:13:09.733 --> 01:13:10.690
- Sutter?

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:12.344
You called in the casualties?

01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:15.608
- Yes sir, three klicks
northeast of Phong My.

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:18.481
- Bravo Company's the
only unit out here!

01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:19.743
How many men are you missing?

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.701
- Three unaccounted for, sir.

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:25.836
Took off during a firefight
outside Phong Nam.

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:27.577
- Where's the rest
of the platoon?

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.187
- This is it.

01:13:31.668 --> 01:13:34.584
- All right, get your
gunner squad on the chopper.

01:13:34.758 --> 01:13:36.063
- Sir?

01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:38.588
- We're gonna sweep and
look for these clowns.

01:13:38.762 --> 01:13:41.025
I want some firepower on board.

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:43.767
Rest of the platoon,
get up to the LZ

01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:47.727
and rendezvous with the
rest of the company.

01:14:45.263 --> 01:14:46.743
- You are our friends.

01:14:46.917 --> 01:14:48.092
And you're not bad.

01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:49.267
- Yes.

01:14:49.441 --> 01:14:50.877
- Hey, tell 'em about Meeks--

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:54.925
- You wear American uniform.

01:14:55.099 --> 01:14:57.144
You carry American guns.

01:14:57.318 --> 01:14:59.756
You shoot Americans bullets.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:02.498
Your planes drop
Americans bombs,

01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:05.370
and kill Vietnamese children.

01:15:05.544 --> 01:15:07.894
- We killed 20 American soldiers

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:10.462
because they were
shooting Vietnamese.

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:11.985
We killed them.

01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:14.988
- We didn't choose this,
we fightin' against it.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:19.863
- Soul man.

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:22.474
Soul man in Vietnam
is like a fly

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:25.433
caught between two
fighting buffalo.

01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.880
- Let us go and we'll
never come back.

01:15:37.054 --> 01:15:40.231
- Vietnamese people
starve because of you.

01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:42.973
Vietnamese people
cannot grow rice,

01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:46.629
because Americans planes
sprays Agent Orange

01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:48.326
and destroys the farm.

01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:53.157
American mines take
what once created life

01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:55.028
and make it death.

01:16:02.949 --> 01:16:06.344
Vietnamese people
fight for 1,000 years

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:08.215
to get freedom from Chinese.

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.878
Vietnamese people
fight for 1,000 more.

01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:21.272
And for 1,000 more after that.

01:16:21.446 --> 01:16:23.187
Bullets will not help you.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:24.841
Bombs will not help you.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:27.495
And God will not help you.

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:33.980
You will only die.

01:16:44.991 --> 01:16:46.036
Go!

01:16:55.915 --> 01:16:57.830
- The fuck we gonna do?

01:16:58.004 --> 01:17:00.920
- I ain't dyin' on no
motherfuckin' landmine!

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:04.532
- They're gonna shoot us.

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:09.233
- Spread out, one goes down,
the others keep movin'.

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:10.974
When I yell, we
break for the trees.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.991
Three...

01:17:30.123 --> 01:17:31.081
Two...

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.432
One.

01:17:38.915 --> 01:17:39.742
- There!

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:43.267
There, GIs, open field upriver!

01:17:44.137 --> 01:17:45.269
- Bring her in, Captain.

01:17:46.313 --> 01:17:48.185
- Those boys move,
you gun 'em down.

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:50.274
They're dangerous.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:01.154
- You know her?

01:18:01.328 --> 01:18:03.069
- Yeah.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:10.598
- Go home, soul man.

01:18:10.773 --> 01:18:12.296
It's not your war.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.438
- Down!

01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:42.979
- Clear this hooch.

01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:51.509
- Hey, hey, hey, hang tight.

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:54.251
Remember that door gunner.

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:02.825
- Thank God you found us!

01:19:02.999 --> 01:19:05.523
How did you--
- Stay where you are.

01:19:11.094 --> 01:19:13.313
- There's your rogues, sir.

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:14.227
- Man, what the hell--

01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:15.315
- Sir, what's goin' on?

01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:16.621
- Oh, don't play stupid.

01:19:16.795 --> 01:19:18.579
We know what you did.

01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:21.887
- What the motherfuck
are you talkin' about?

01:19:22.061 --> 01:19:23.367
- He knows.

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:24.803
We all do.

01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:28.154
After y'all ditched us in
the firefight back there,

01:19:28.328 --> 01:19:30.417
y'all up and greased a
bunch of our own guys.

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:32.376
That's goddamn bullshit!

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.117
- We been here two days!
- That's bullshit.

01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:35.858
- We been here two days.

01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:37.250
Charlie picked us up at
the end of the firefight,

01:19:37.424 --> 01:19:39.862
where LT motherfuckin'
bailed on us.

01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:42.560
So I don't know what
you're talkin' about, sir.

01:19:42.734 --> 01:19:44.214
- That's bullshit.

01:19:44.388 --> 01:19:45.650
- Yeah?

01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:47.043
Where were you, LT?

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:52.657
- Well, I was cleanin' up
the mess you bailed on.

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:55.181
Only then to find out
that you made another one.

01:19:56.617 --> 01:19:57.749
On purpose.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:01.100
- How 'bout you, Meeks?

01:20:01.274 --> 01:20:02.449
Where were you?

01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:04.190
- You heard the man.

01:20:04.364 --> 01:20:07.628
Moppin' up your mess with
the rest of the platoon.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:11.110
- He was with you
the whole time?

01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:12.242
- Yeah.

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:13.852
He was.

01:20:14.331 --> 01:20:15.332
- Why don't you
waste these niggers

01:20:15.506 --> 01:20:17.987
before they try some shit?

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:19.553
- Colonel?

01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:21.599
How'd the men die?

01:20:22.078 --> 01:20:23.731
- He knows how they died.

01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:26.299
- They were shot.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:28.562
- What kind of brass?

01:20:28.736 --> 01:20:30.913
5.56, M16?

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:32.523
- 7.62.

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:35.004
Somebody used a 60 on 'em.

01:20:35.178 --> 01:20:37.397
- I ain't never fired
a pig in my life.

01:20:37.571 --> 01:20:39.269
- Sir.

01:20:39.443 --> 01:20:42.402
Only one man in the
platoon had an M60,

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:44.448
and it wasn't any of us.

01:20:50.758 --> 01:20:52.195
- What the fuck?

01:20:52.369 --> 01:20:53.631
Are you accusing me
of killin' my own men?

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:56.982
Fuck you!

01:20:57.896 --> 01:21:00.290
You cocksuckin' piece of shit!

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:01.769
You fuckin' nigger, fuck you!

01:21:01.944 --> 01:21:03.293
- Hold on.

01:21:03.467 --> 01:21:06.949
Now, how much
ammunition did you use?

01:21:07.645 --> 01:21:09.125
- I mean hell, I don't know.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:10.561
Six belts?

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:12.780
- Looks
like you used more than that.

01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:15.653
Let me see that weapon, son.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.231
- I don't know how
in the fuckin' hell

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:29.885
a couple of forked-tongue,
black-ass sons of bitches

01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:31.974
get away with accusin'
red-blooded Americans

01:21:32.148 --> 01:21:33.497
of turnin' on their own kind.

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:38.241
You wanna be Malcolm X,
don't you, you piece of shit?

01:21:38.415 --> 01:21:39.720
I swear to God,

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.549
you better be facin' a
firing squad next week.

01:21:42.723 --> 01:21:45.422
I wanna see you hang, nigger!

01:21:45.596 --> 01:21:48.077
I wanna see you fuckin' dead!

01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:52.037
- What's in your pocket?

01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:55.998
- A couple pairs of dry socks.

01:22:00.219 --> 01:22:01.394
- Take it out, son.

01:22:15.713 --> 01:22:17.106
Gimme those.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:27.725
You son of a bitch.

01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:37.430
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Meeks!

01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:39.432
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:44.960
Meeks, stand down!

01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:49.660
Stand down!

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:54.578
Fuck, Meeks!

01:22:54.752 --> 01:22:56.101
I will shoot you!

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:02.934
Meeks!

01:23:40.928 --> 01:23:42.713
- This is fucked...
