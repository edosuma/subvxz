WEBVTT

00:04.283 --> 00:06.203
Previously,
on "Future Man"...

00:06.204 --> 00:09.000
See how we fit into
this brave new world, huh?

00:09.001 --> 00:10.921
That's no stray,
that's Torque!

00:10.922 --> 00:12.675
- She biotech?
- We'll know for sure

00:12.676 --> 00:14.720
after she takes
the sewer mushroom test.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.603
I'm the father of the cure,

00:18.604 --> 00:21.316
and you're kind of the mom.

00:21.317 --> 00:23.404
- There he is!
- Welcome back, Torque!

00:23.405 --> 00:26.034
- What's my deal?
- You should make wheels.

00:26.035 --> 00:27.913
- I'm a wheel maker.
- It feels like

00:27.914 --> 00:29.709
forever ago.
You were always looking

00:29.710 --> 00:31.295
for a way out.
What changed?

00:31.296 --> 00:33.382
Perspective.

00:33.383 --> 00:35.303
This changes everything.

00:35.304 --> 00:37.098
He crashed the simulation
in less than ten minutes.

00:37.099 --> 00:38.935
If we harness that power
and use it to bring down

00:38.936 --> 00:40.522
the entire system,
then we strike.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.358
This procedure
will 100% kill him.

00:42.359 --> 00:44.154
- Kill him?
- We need to find Tiger

00:44.155 --> 00:46.033
and go back
and un-fuck this timeline.

00:46.034 --> 00:48.454
- You can't leave the NAG.
- Wolf, pack your shit.

00:48.455 --> 00:50.082
- We're leaving.
- Oh.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.337
Oh, you're not dead.

00:52.338 --> 00:53.507
Fun.
You can come, too.

00:57.222 --> 00:59.100
I see a light up ahead.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.146
Thank God.

01:01.147 --> 01:02.983
After that, it's just
another mile or so.

01:02.984 --> 01:05.237
You know how many wheels
I'm gonna have to sell

01:05.238 --> 01:06.658
to pay for this
little field trip?

01:06.659 --> 01:08.327
It's not a field trip, okay?

01:08.328 --> 01:10.414
We're on a mission
to the cave.

01:10.415 --> 01:12.043
- We're not going to the cave.
- We're going to get the TTD.

01:12.044 --> 01:14.130
- Which is in the cave.
- That's impossible.

01:14.131 --> 01:16.426
Maybe--maybe
the Pointed Circle has

01:16.427 --> 01:19.140
- their own TTD.
- No, also impossible.

01:19.141 --> 01:22.105
There's no other TTDs
or Cameronium in this timeline.

01:22.106 --> 01:23.775
How the fuck did we do that?

01:23.776 --> 01:26.739
Eh, I think that was on me.

01:26.740 --> 01:28.535
You see, back in the '80s
me and Arnold used

01:28.536 --> 01:30.622
to work out together.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.208
Schwarzenegger.

01:32.209 --> 01:34.045
He set me up
with a little office

01:34.046 --> 01:35.590
on the Paramount lot.

01:35.591 --> 01:37.427
Said I was the only one
he could trust

01:37.428 --> 01:39.557
to read his scripts,
which is how I got my hands

01:39.558 --> 01:43.857
on a little jewel
called "T2: Judgment Day."

01:43.858 --> 01:45.819
And judge I did.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.449
It was a firecracker,
blowing up the way we think

01:48.450 --> 01:50.244
about sci-fi.

01:50.245 --> 01:52.331
It was also
frighteningly prescient

01:52.332 --> 01:55.254
about the realities
and dangers of time travel.

01:55.255 --> 01:57.593
And I buried it.

01:59.723 --> 02:02.477
I convinced Arnold that
he shouldn't do a sequel.

02:02.478 --> 02:05.441
True artists
never repeat themselves.

02:05.442 --> 02:07.988
Eventually, our old buddy
"Jim" Cameron came by

02:07.989 --> 02:09.867
to ask me in person.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.621
It was pathetic.

02:11.622 --> 02:14.334
I guess he really needed
a win after "The Abyss."

02:14.335 --> 02:16.964
"T2" could be his ticket
back into the bigs,

02:16.965 --> 02:20.012
fueling his twin loves
of blockbuster filmmaking

02:20.013 --> 02:21.974
and deep-sea exploration.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.147
That's when I got
a little thing I like to call,

02:25.148 --> 02:27.485
"pre-venge."

02:27.486 --> 02:28.837
Of course,
he had neither built

02:28.838 --> 02:30.861
nor even conceived
his robot house,

02:30.862 --> 02:33.036
SIGORN-E, but I knew.

02:33.037 --> 02:35.843
Oh, I knew the hell
he was gonna put her through

02:35.844 --> 02:37.643
and the tender mercy
I'd show her

02:37.644 --> 02:40.999
as she faded
into cold, sweet oblivion.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.350
He must have been

02:43.351 --> 02:46.314
so confused.

02:46.315 --> 02:48.277
He would later move
to the Carolina coast

02:48.278 --> 02:49.613
to convalesce

02:49.614 --> 02:53.328
and build sailboats by hand.

02:53.329 --> 02:55.040
Wolf, that is hardly
what I would call

02:55.041 --> 02:57.253
- a proportionate response.
- Well, at the time

02:57.254 --> 02:59.425
I was doing a lot
of butt cocaine.

03:00.427 --> 03:02.054
Okay.

03:02.055 --> 03:04.350
Then, Tiger, I definitely saw
your TTD, then.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.937
No. No way.

03:05.938 --> 03:08.860
I buried it somewhere
they will never find.

03:10.155 --> 03:12.450
Son of a bitch.

03:18.296 --> 03:20.424
All right.
Let's go to your cave

03:20.425 --> 03:22.345
and steal back our TTD.

03:22.346 --> 03:24.015
No.

03:24.016 --> 03:25.602
We're gonna have to do
more than that, all right?

03:25.603 --> 03:26.812
We created this timeline,
and now everyone here

03:26.813 --> 03:28.440
is in danger.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.444
We owe it to this world
to try and save them.

03:30.445 --> 03:31.906
What is there
to save them from?

03:31.907 --> 03:33.785
No one's fighting,
we're above ground.

03:33.786 --> 03:36.414
- This place rules.
- First of all, it doesn't.

03:36.415 --> 03:39.003
Second of all, I told you--
there is a war coming.

03:39.004 --> 03:41.049
- I heard it.
- Yeah, through a vent

03:41.050 --> 03:42.886
wearing a piss-stained sheet.

03:42.887 --> 03:44.682
Okay, the point is,

03:44.683 --> 03:46.978
we are Time Warriors now.

03:46.979 --> 03:49.650
- Ti-time Warriors?
- Yes, Time Warriors.

03:49.651 --> 03:51.319
It makes perfect sense.
We travelled through time

03:51.320 --> 03:53.533
- fighting for justice.
- Mm.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.286
Okay.

03:55.287 --> 03:57.081
Okay, Time Warrior.

03:57.082 --> 04:00.046
Point us in the direction
of the cave you escaped from.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.978
- Uh, there's a lot of clouds.
- It's gonna be hard.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.439
Yeah, that's what I thought.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.318
I'm on it.
Let's go.

04:11.319 --> 04:15.451
- Pathetic, Futturman.
- I know what it looks like.

04:20.504 --> 04:23.593
Hey, if we incinerated
all of Kronish's research

04:23.594 --> 04:25.638
I just don't understand
how Stu was able

04:25.639 --> 04:27.976
to still find a cure.

04:27.977 --> 04:30.189
What I don't understand
is how you wandered

04:30.190 --> 04:33.445
in a circle for most of the day
and didn't realize it.

04:33.446 --> 04:36.660
Sorry, Tiger, I was dying.

04:36.661 --> 04:39.750
And here's a hole
where you drank

04:39.751 --> 04:41.754
your own pee--no.

04:41.755 --> 04:43.549
Tried to drink your own pee.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.595
That--that is totally not
what happened.

04:45.596 --> 04:47.516
Wow, look at these
claw marks.

04:47.517 --> 04:49.812
Just so desperate to get

04:49.813 --> 04:51.607
every last drop.

04:51.608 --> 04:52.984
Hmm.

04:52.985 --> 04:54.153
You hesitated.

04:54.154 --> 04:55.949
That was your downfall.

04:55.950 --> 04:58.161
Hey, there's a whole bunch
of people to see

04:58.162 --> 04:59.581
when you get back to the NAG.

04:59.582 --> 05:01.042
Muskrat--

05:01.043 --> 05:03.506
well, you'll know him now
as Flathead.

05:03.507 --> 05:05.134
He's crazy as ever.

05:05.135 --> 05:08.473
Naked Mole Rat, aka Hacksaw.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.144
What's with these tool names?

05:10.145 --> 05:11.730
Okay?
They're stupid.

05:11.731 --> 05:13.150
"Hacksaw."

05:13.151 --> 05:15.362
Now, "Naked Mole Rat" --

05:15.363 --> 05:17.324
- that's a name.
- Well, I guess the point

05:17.325 --> 05:19.120
- is they're--they're alive.
- Right.

05:19.121 --> 05:21.124
As completely
different people who have

05:21.125 --> 05:23.253
no idea who we are and don't
have our shared experiences.

05:23.254 --> 05:26.259
Well, I guess that just means
we get to create new ones.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.221
Right, with people
who smash technology

05:28.222 --> 05:30.894
- and live in garbage houses.
- Guys, guys, guys!

05:30.895 --> 05:33.691
This bush looks
really familiar.

05:33.692 --> 05:35.402
Nope.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.572
No, no, I'm wrong.

05:36.573 --> 05:38.618
Keep--keep going.

05:38.619 --> 05:41.582
Hey, who told you
about the NAG, anyway?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.418
- Oh, you know.
- I poked around,

05:43.419 --> 05:46.382
explored the back country,
the Mons, the abandoned city.

05:46.383 --> 05:48.094
- The Mons?
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.095 --> 05:50.558
Oh, did you wet your blade
on some Biotic blood?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.311
Uh, well, no.

05:52.312 --> 05:54.440
Bio-Techs are not the same
as Biotics.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.152
Big, big difference.

05:56.153 --> 05:57.697
I mean, first of all
it's spelled differently

05:57.698 --> 05:59.033
and, uh, they're not
hunting humans.

05:59.034 --> 06:00.828
- They're going to Mars.
- Oh.

06:00.829 --> 06:02.707
Sounds like someone got
awful chummy over there

06:02.708 --> 06:04.293
- with the Chopes.
- Whoa.

06:04.294 --> 06:06.130
I don't know what
that word means,

06:06.131 --> 06:07.968
- but it sounds pretty racist.
- Stands for "Chosen People."

06:07.969 --> 06:10.013
'Cause they control
the government, the money,

06:10.014 --> 06:12.561
- and the weather.
- You're just making it worse.

06:14.106 --> 06:15.733
I recognize this place.

06:15.734 --> 06:17.737
Think the cave is just over
this ridge.

06:17.738 --> 06:20.409
Look, anything you heard
over there is a filthy lie.

06:20.410 --> 06:21.954
That's what Bio-Techs do.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.250
It's in their tainted blood.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.170
When you get to the NAG
you're--you're gonna see

06:26.171 --> 06:28.383
- how much better it is.
- Yeah, no, I was there.

06:28.384 --> 06:30.597
And somehow we got out
of the sewer

06:30.598 --> 06:32.474
but seemed to be surrounded
by more shit.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.646
Oh, did you see all that
in the three minutes

06:34.647 --> 06:36.692
before you dumped me
on the curb?

06:36.693 --> 06:39.447
Like Charlie Sheen dumped me
from a slow-rolling Lambo

06:39.448 --> 06:43.121
outside "Cedars"
after the '89 Oscars?

06:43.122 --> 06:45.292
I still don't know
how he drove.

06:45.293 --> 06:47.087
God, that guy had
his shit together.

06:47.088 --> 06:48.549
Guys!

06:48.550 --> 06:49.968
Guys, I see it!
It's right over here!

06:49.969 --> 06:52.473
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just give us a second.

06:52.474 --> 06:54.352
Yeah, I left and I came back.

06:54.353 --> 06:56.523
Did you even try to find me?

06:56.524 --> 06:58.903
- Doesn't matter.
- We're leaving this time.

06:58.904 --> 07:00.865
Our mission was to stop
the cure.

07:00.866 --> 07:02.535
We failed.
We need to try again.

07:02.536 --> 07:04.497
- No, no, no.
- We shot for the stars

07:04.498 --> 07:06.794
and we landed on a cloud.

07:06.795 --> 07:08.839
We didn't sacrifice
everyone and everything

07:08.840 --> 07:10.217
to settle
for a second-rate future.

07:10.218 --> 07:12.514
No, I'm done diddling
with time.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.685
- Our present is now.
- I vote we go.

07:14.686 --> 07:16.229
- I vote we stay.
- Fine.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.481
- Futturman will break the tie.
- He doesn't get

07:17.482 --> 07:19.068
- a full vote, though.
- Half.

07:19.069 --> 07:20.487
- Third.
- All right, the point is,

07:20.488 --> 07:21.907
- he knows it's less than full.
- Agreed.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.287
Futturman!

07:31.051 --> 07:32.595
They dragged him here.

07:32.596 --> 07:34.975
Doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.603
This is all your fault.

07:36.604 --> 07:39.108
You got distracted drinking
the Mons Kool-Aid.

07:39.109 --> 07:41.237
I could smell it
on your breath.

07:41.238 --> 07:43.074
Huh, what's Kool-Aid?

07:43.075 --> 07:45.412
Don't care.
We're about to go into battle,

07:45.413 --> 07:48.126
so drop trou and let's
incorporate this hostility,

07:48.127 --> 07:49.713
'cause everyone knows
the best charge

07:49.714 --> 07:51.174
is a hate charge.

07:51.175 --> 07:53.428
So let her rip.

08:00.903 --> 08:03.448
What's your 20
on that charging rod?

08:06.664 --> 08:08.542
Oh, I can't.

08:08.543 --> 08:11.380
It's not right.

08:11.381 --> 08:13.677
I'm married now.

08:13.678 --> 08:17.059
Two beautiful husbands,
three handsome wives...

08:17.060 --> 08:19.188
and our pride and joy...

08:19.189 --> 08:20.566
Lugnut.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.529
Your--what, your car?

08:22.530 --> 08:24.991
Daughter.

08:24.992 --> 08:27.580
Okay, and what does any of that

08:27.581 --> 08:29.918
have to do with us
charging up?

08:29.919 --> 08:32.507
Well, it may be crazy
to think that a man

08:32.508 --> 08:34.343
can only have sex
with five people

08:34.344 --> 08:36.305
for the rest of his life,
but God damn it

08:36.306 --> 08:38.059
- I want to try.
- You want to go ahead

08:38.060 --> 08:39.855
and wash that bullshit out
of your mouth?

08:39.856 --> 08:41.692
Did you know that charging
doesn't have to be painful

08:41.693 --> 08:43.946
- at the start?
- Uh, yeah, it does.

08:43.947 --> 08:45.575
It's the friction that starts
the fire.

08:45.576 --> 08:47.160
No.

08:47.161 --> 08:50.000
There's a thing called
"pre-Sow-play."

08:50.001 --> 08:51.503
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:51.504 --> 08:53.423
We kiss and...

08:53.424 --> 08:55.761
we hug.

08:55.762 --> 08:57.807
Feel some hot breath
on your neck...

08:59.477 --> 09:01.314
Maybe a...

09:01.315 --> 09:03.484
maybe a tongue on your earlobe.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.869
Lightly knead a--

09:07.870 --> 09:09.623
a nipple or two.

09:11.209 --> 09:13.338
Just get lost
in the elegant design

09:13.339 --> 09:16.218
of the human body.

09:16.219 --> 09:17.889
Oh...

09:17.890 --> 09:19.350
You kiss?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.855
So now you're just--
just going around

09:21.856 --> 09:24.653
- touching rat-holes?
- That's yesterday's timeline.

09:24.654 --> 09:26.280
We eat beans now.

09:26.281 --> 09:27.742
And yes.

09:27.743 --> 09:29.621
I put my bean-hole
over every inch

09:29.622 --> 09:31.584
of my lovers.

09:35.132 --> 09:36.843
- Where you going?
- Well, I'm gonna go

09:36.844 --> 09:38.429
self-charge, thanks to you.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.183
And you know what?
I'm very particular, okay?

09:40.184 --> 09:42.020
So don't make a noise,
and don't make me feel guilty

09:42.021 --> 09:43.774
because I'm taking too long.

09:43.775 --> 09:46.362
That'll only make it
take longer.

09:46.363 --> 09:48.618
All right.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.305
You gave us quite a scare,
there.

09:59.306 --> 10:01.309
You know, if--if you were
gonna murder me,

10:01.310 --> 10:03.814
why go to the trouble
of making me feel like a hero?

10:03.815 --> 10:05.275
Fine, you're not a hero.

10:05.276 --> 10:08.031
- You're a tool.
- Does that have

10:08.032 --> 10:09.158
the same meaning here
as it does in my time?

10:09.159 --> 10:11.580
What does it mean in yours?

10:11.581 --> 10:13.374
- Kind of like a dumb idiot.
- Oh, well in that case

10:13.375 --> 10:15.128
you're more of a tool
than I thought.

10:15.129 --> 10:16.965
You're that, but also
a blunt instrument

10:16.966 --> 10:18.844
we intend to use
to carry out a task.

10:18.845 --> 10:20.263
Ouch.

10:20.264 --> 10:21.683
You do have
some fighting spirit.

10:21.684 --> 10:23.227
You escaped...

10:23.228 --> 10:24.898
but had the good sense
to come back

10:24.899 --> 10:26.651
when he realized the desert
meant certain death.

10:26.652 --> 10:28.572
It's more than I can say
for the first Josh.

10:28.573 --> 10:31.160
He's probably dead by now.

10:31.161 --> 10:33.874
Wrapped in a bed sheet,
his carcass scorched

10:33.875 --> 10:35.961
by the unforgiving sun.

10:35.962 --> 10:37.632
I can assure you,

10:37.633 --> 10:39.886
your death will not be
so ignominious.

10:39.887 --> 10:42.349
Meaning of or related to...?

10:42.350 --> 10:43.977
It means undignified.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.815
Your death will bring down
the Camillo Machine

10:45.816 --> 10:48.570
and humanity will once again
control its own fate.

10:48.571 --> 10:50.448
- Led by you.
- No, by Achilles.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.119
We all serve Achilles.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.705
And we've learned our lesson.

10:53.706 --> 10:56.460
Now, when we strap you
to the chair...

10:56.461 --> 10:59.592
we'll be using
child-sized restraints.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.763
Your slender wrists
won't save you this time.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.306
- No, no, no, no!
- Stay away!

11:23.307 --> 11:25.143
Shh, shh, stay away!

11:26.731 --> 11:29.109
- Oh, my God.
- Stay away!

11:29.110 --> 11:31.531
Stay away!
Okay, okay, okay!

11:31.532 --> 11:33.952
Okay, okay.

11:36.082 --> 11:38.962
- Holy shit.
- Stay away, stay away.

11:38.963 --> 11:40.758
- You're okay, all right?
- You're okay, you're okay.

11:40.759 --> 11:42.427
Just--just breathe, all right?

11:42.428 --> 11:44.056
How--how long
were you in there?

11:44.057 --> 11:46.185
- In there?
- I don't know.

11:46.186 --> 11:47.730
I don't know,
I was in The Black.

11:47.731 --> 11:49.066
The Black--I'm safe.
I'm safe in The Black.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.445
I--I couldn't see, but I--

11:51.446 --> 11:53.951
I could hear.
I heard everything.

11:53.952 --> 11:55.328
- I heard everything.
- Okay, okay.

11:55.329 --> 11:56.915
Now--now listen to me,
all right?

11:56.916 --> 11:59.879
I am J1, the original Josh.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.423
All right?
Tiger and Wolf are gonna

12:01.424 --> 12:05.056
- be here any minute now.
- I remember them.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.185
- They were my friends.
- Now, listen, I need to know:

12:07.186 --> 12:10.233
why are they trying to kill us?

12:10.234 --> 12:12.947
Hey, why are these people
trying to kill us?

12:14.785 --> 12:16.997
We're--they're--

12:16.998 --> 12:18.959
Um, it's like...

12:18.960 --> 12:20.671
a poison pill.

12:20.672 --> 12:22.925
It's--it's our brains.
They're gonna take them and--

12:22.926 --> 12:25.346
and make them into, like,
a computer virus

12:25.347 --> 12:27.852
and upload them inside of Stu.

12:27.853 --> 12:30.398
And--and that's gonna make
the entire system

12:30.399 --> 12:32.152
come crashing down

12:32.153 --> 12:34.741
- just like...
- "Independence Day."

12:37.204 --> 12:39.291
But--but why--why me?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.045
- Us.
- You? Us?

12:41.046 --> 12:42.380
Oy.

12:42.381 --> 12:44.301
You're, uh...

12:46.682 --> 12:48.267
you're J1.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.065
The programming for--
for the sim was Stu's,

12:51.066 --> 12:54.071
and--and you crashed it.

12:54.072 --> 12:57.243
So this--this was actually
because of you.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.291
- You gave them the idea.
- But--but I--

13:00.292 --> 13:01.711
I didn't do anything.

13:01.712 --> 13:03.757
I--I was just being me.

13:03.758 --> 13:05.301
Exactly.

13:05.302 --> 13:08.684
Exactly.
See, it's--it's like...

13:08.685 --> 13:10.896
- it's like he's afraid of us.
- I mean, we did blow up

13:10.897 --> 13:12.650
the place he works,
murdering all of his friends

13:12.651 --> 13:15.363
- and colleagues.
- For a good cause.

13:18.538 --> 13:20.373
No.

13:20.374 --> 13:22.001
We gotta hide.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.797
You--you gotta find
a different hole.

13:23.798 --> 13:25.216
- Easy.
- I'm saving the back

13:25.217 --> 13:26.803
of the needle--
the needle's coming.

13:26.804 --> 13:28.222
The needle can't get me
if I'm in the Black.

13:28.223 --> 13:29.224
Okay, so I'm gonna go
into The Black

13:29.225 --> 13:30.561
- and you...
- Listen!

13:32.189 --> 13:33.482
- Okay, you're not hiding.
- Okay, I am!

13:33.483 --> 13:35.904
I have a plan.

13:48.556 --> 13:50.057
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

13:58.450 --> 14:00.829
The...

14:00.830 --> 14:02.750
the fuck did you get a shiv?

14:02.751 --> 14:05.714
It was a gift from The Black.

14:05.715 --> 14:06.925
Okay.

14:06.926 --> 14:08.678
Let's go.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.704
- Ah...
- Hey, come on.

14:21.705 --> 14:23.959
It's a fucking light, let's go.

14:32.811 --> 14:34.689
- The way out is...
- Shh!

14:34.690 --> 14:37.402
- It's over here.
- Yeah, come on.

14:37.403 --> 14:39.740
I know.

14:39.741 --> 14:41.410
I know the way out,
I know the way out.

14:41.411 --> 14:44.165
- The precious way out.
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.961
Listen to me--
we are not leaving, all right?

14:45.962 --> 14:47.965
We are gonna stay here and hide

14:47.966 --> 14:49.677
until Tiger and Wolf come.

14:49.678 --> 14:51.598
Maybe...

14:51.599 --> 14:53.183
- maybe here, in this one.
- No!

14:53.184 --> 14:54.854
No, no, no!
Not that room!

14:54.855 --> 14:56.189
Not that room!
Never that room!

14:56.190 --> 14:57.735
Never that room!
These--these people,

14:57.736 --> 14:59.487
they're insane, okay?

14:59.488 --> 15:01.659
They're--they're not just gonna
kill Stu, they're--

15:01.660 --> 15:03.705
they're gonna sabotage
the Mars launch and--

15:03.706 --> 15:04.999
and break the armistice.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.878
It's gonna be war
all over again!

15:06.879 --> 15:08.297
- The end is nigh!
- Shh! Stop!

15:08.298 --> 15:10.009
- Stop it! Stop it!
- The end is nigh!

15:10.010 --> 15:11.679
The end is nigh!

15:11.680 --> 15:13.808
Hey, what the hell's
going on down there?

15:15.187 --> 15:17.524
Come on, come on!

15:17.525 --> 15:19.654
Come--Josh!

15:21.992 --> 15:24.245
- You!
- Stay right there.

15:31.595 --> 15:33.222
♪ Do-do-do-do ♪

15:33.223 --> 15:35.811
Oh.

15:35.812 --> 15:38.399
No! It's not me!

15:38.400 --> 15:39.902
I'm in there!

15:39.903 --> 15:41.990
I'm in there!
It's not me!

15:41.991 --> 15:43.827
It's not me!

15:50.257 --> 15:51.969
What the fuck?

15:59.066 --> 16:01.236
The hell were you doing
to yourself over there?

16:01.237 --> 16:02.488
Shut up.
Take this.

16:02.489 --> 16:04.785
I don't use tools of war.

16:04.786 --> 16:07.666
I'm a humble craftsman.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.256
I don't know who you are
anymore.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.601
- Okay.
- That comfortable?

16:16.602 --> 16:17.978
Good.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.487
Okay, J26.

16:22.488 --> 16:24.658
The good news is...

16:24.659 --> 16:26.119
Since you were last
in this chair,

16:26.120 --> 16:28.833
I recalibrated
the upload VDR quotients

16:28.834 --> 16:30.796
and that should take care
of the transitional

16:30.797 --> 16:32.465
adrenaline spikes.

16:32.466 --> 16:34.553
Reverse-engineering
Stu's tech was a lot harder

16:34.554 --> 16:36.056
than it looks,

16:36.057 --> 16:39.229
and J's 27 through 60
died pretty...

16:40.691 --> 16:42.360
pretty horribly.

16:42.361 --> 16:45.032
Oh, here we go.

16:45.033 --> 16:46.869
This guy's
for liquefied brain matter.

16:46.870 --> 16:49.834
- Yeah.
- Hope we don't need that.

16:49.835 --> 16:51.963
But I gotta tell ya...

16:51.964 --> 16:53.508
I really think this one's
gonna work.

16:53.509 --> 16:55.177
Let me just get

16:55.178 --> 16:57.265
that needle ready.

17:00.188 --> 17:03.152
To capture your mind
in binary code,

17:03.153 --> 17:05.489
I need to stimulate
every synapse in your brain

17:05.490 --> 17:08.120
all at once, so you're gonna
feel every emotion,

17:08.121 --> 17:10.457
every memory simultaneously.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.838
And then I'm gonna exist
inside of a computer

17:12.839 --> 17:14.340
- like in "Tron"?
- You know what?

17:14.341 --> 17:16.971
It's so funny--
every Josh asks me that

17:16.972 --> 17:18.725
and I tell you all
the same thing:

17:18.726 --> 17:21.062
- I have no idea what "Tron" is.
- No...

17:21.063 --> 17:22.900
- All right, ready?
- No!

17:37.095 --> 17:38.598
Hey, you getting
the same readings

17:38.599 --> 17:40.184
- that I am in here?
- His occipital flares

17:40.185 --> 17:42.271
- are well within our margins.
- Yeah, I know,

17:42.272 --> 17:43.650
but this could
actually be our...

17:46.698 --> 17:48.492
Another death rattle.

17:48.493 --> 17:50.454
God damn it.

17:50.455 --> 17:52.793
Tell Apollo we have
another one for the pile.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.513
Hold on, this one's
still alive.

18:00.433 --> 18:02.521
- Awls!
- Awls?

18:06.070 --> 18:08.323
Dr. Eunice Hogeveen?

18:17.844 --> 18:19.555
I think we can
still save him!

18:21.727 --> 18:22.853
Oh!

18:22.854 --> 18:24.240
He's on the move!

18:24.241 --> 18:26.527
I do not have eyes on him.
Do not have eyes on, repeat.

18:30.035 --> 18:32.622
Oh, God.

18:32.623 --> 18:34.585
Okay.

18:34.586 --> 18:36.379
Okay, you can do this.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.091
You can do this.

18:38.092 --> 18:40.764
It's just a--just a normal...

18:40.765 --> 18:42.016
pile of corpses.

18:42.017 --> 18:43.895
Okay.

18:43.896 --> 18:45.481
Don't look down.

18:47.486 --> 18:49.740
Oh!

18:51.369 --> 18:53.664
It's wet.

18:58.257 --> 19:00.637
Okay. Sorry.

19:00.638 --> 19:03.518
Sorry.

19:14.791 --> 19:16.710
- Hang on, buddy.
- Don't quit on us now.

19:16.711 --> 19:18.130
God dam it, we're losing him!

19:18.131 --> 19:19.842
These lines keep going
up and down!

19:19.843 --> 19:21.637
- His body's freaking out!
- Okay, we need

19:21.638 --> 19:23.056
to stabilize him!

19:23.057 --> 19:24.726
I'm gonna do CPK.

19:30.573 --> 19:32.826
- It's not working.
- Pound harder!

19:36.459 --> 19:38.546
He's stabilized.

19:38.547 --> 19:39.631
Yes.

19:39.632 --> 19:41.176
Yes.
We saved him.

19:41.177 --> 19:43.430
Yeah.

19:46.730 --> 19:48.148
Athena, we've got
the intruders up on Level 4.

19:48.149 --> 19:49.943
You want him,
you're gonna have

19:49.944 --> 19:52.490
- to get through us.
- Shit's about to get wheel.

20:05.893 --> 20:08.355
Metal spoke sharpener!

20:17.667 --> 20:19.795
Tiger!
I hear beeps!

20:19.796 --> 20:21.464
God damn it,
we're losing him again.

20:28.271 --> 20:30.482
Live! Live! Live!

20:30.483 --> 20:32.027
Here!

20:45.305 --> 20:46.557
All right.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.980
Yes!

20:49.981 --> 20:53.361
I gotta hand it to him,
he's a fighter.

20:53.362 --> 20:55.909
- So are we.
- Yeah.

21:18.329 --> 21:21.502
Perhaps I underestimated you
after all...

21:21.503 --> 21:23.715
J1.

21:32.315 --> 21:34.653
Drop the machete, Athena.

21:36.156 --> 21:38.410
You can kill me,
but I serve Achilles.

21:38.411 --> 21:40.288
If you strike me down
you'll stop nothing.

21:40.289 --> 21:41.792
No, I'm not a killer.

21:41.793 --> 21:43.587
I'm not like you,
you mass-murderer.

21:43.588 --> 21:45.132
Um, you're the mass-murderer.

21:45.133 --> 21:47.219
I only killed one person
59 times.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.931
You blew up a whole building
full of people.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.350
Yeah, for a good cause.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.895
That's the thing about you,
isn't it?

21:51.896 --> 21:54.275
Obsessed with the big gesture,
your role

21:54.276 --> 21:56.112
in the fate of mankind.

21:56.113 --> 21:57.782
I--I didn't ask for this,
okay?

21:57.783 --> 21:59.368
- It was--it was...
- Thrust upon me...

21:59.369 --> 22:01.414
- "When I least expected it."
- I know the story.

22:01.415 --> 22:03.084
I've heard it 59 times.

22:03.085 --> 22:04.921
That's how we got you
into the upload machine.

22:04.922 --> 22:07.384
All we had to do was tell you
that you were a hero,

22:07.385 --> 22:09.305
- that you were the one.
- You--you're just trying

22:09.306 --> 22:10.892
to make me feel bad
for fighting for good?

22:10.893 --> 22:12.729
- Listen to you.
- All vanity,

22:12.730 --> 22:14.816
self-importance, ego.

22:14.817 --> 22:17.070
You wouldn't understand
actual sacrifice

22:17.071 --> 22:18.783
if it hit you in the shins
with a stool

22:18.784 --> 22:21.162
and disarmed you
in one fell swoop.

22:21.163 --> 22:23.458
That seems like
an oddly specific way to...

22:31.643 --> 22:33.144
You're just a number, J1.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.065
There's plenty more
where you came from.

22:35.066 --> 22:37.904
Each one as predictable
as the last.

22:41.203 --> 22:44.166
What the fuck is that thing?

22:44.167 --> 22:46.295
I don't know,
but he doesn't look happy.

22:47.591 --> 22:49.134
Good thing I saved
this bad boy

22:49.135 --> 22:50.888
- for our largest fool.
- What are you gonna do?

22:50.889 --> 22:53.059
- Take out his watch battery?
- Oh, Tiger.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.230
It's not the size of the tool,

22:55.231 --> 22:57.442
it's the motion
of the craftsman who wields it.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.990
Yeah, right.

23:19.655 --> 23:21.742
He's mocking you, Wolf.

23:35.144 --> 23:36.730
Femoral artery.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.835
Shh...

23:47.836 --> 23:49.213
Easy, easy.

23:49.214 --> 23:51.300
Easy, big fella.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.310
What is happening?

23:56.311 --> 23:59.149
Go gentle
into that good night.

24:08.753 --> 24:11.508
Well, that was one
of our sadder kills.

24:11.509 --> 24:13.595
Wolf, we have a problem.

24:15.016 --> 24:16.977
The machine shows
a calm, flat line

24:16.978 --> 24:18.981
- but there's no pulse.
- See, this is why

24:18.982 --> 24:20.943
you can't trust technology.

24:20.944 --> 24:22.780
Well, what can we say

24:22.781 --> 24:25.452
about our fallen comrade?

24:25.453 --> 24:27.080
Nothing I didn't already say

24:27.081 --> 24:29.502
in that kick-ass eulogy
I gave the first time

24:29.503 --> 24:31.088
we thought he died.

24:31.089 --> 24:33.092
There's no way
I'm topping that.

24:33.093 --> 24:35.556
- Okay.
- Tiger?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.769
Um...

24:37.770 --> 24:40.231
I dunno, I just--
I wish I could...

24:40.232 --> 24:42.653
look in his eyes
one more time and just...

24:44.074 --> 24:45.241
I dunno, just tell him
that I...

24:45.242 --> 24:47.705
Josh.

24:47.706 --> 24:49.374
No, no, continue

24:49.375 --> 24:51.588
- with the nice words.
- How are there two of you?

24:51.589 --> 24:53.257
Uh, time travel--it's weird.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.596
- But please, you were saying...
- No, no, no.

24:55.597 --> 24:57.809
I'll tell you
next time you die.

24:57.810 --> 24:59.854
How do we know
you're our Josh?

25:01.651 --> 25:03.194
Fine.

25:03.195 --> 25:05.699
I tried to drink my own pee
in the desert.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.537
It's good to have you back.

25:07.538 --> 25:09.666
Yeah, well...

25:09.667 --> 25:11.962
What do we do with this one?

25:21.273 --> 25:23.359
Hey, Josh, check it out.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.990
I found a needle
in a you stack.

25:30.082 --> 25:31.668
Isn't it?

25:40.687 --> 25:42.940
Okay, we need to track down
Dr. Eunice Hogeveen

25:42.941 --> 25:44.694
and get that TTD back.

25:44.695 --> 25:46.740
Otherwise, we're stuck
in this shit timeline forever.

25:46.741 --> 25:49.077
Well, TTDs aren't gonna
do much for her.

25:49.078 --> 25:50.706
I knew she'd eventually
overpower me,

25:50.707 --> 25:53.044
so I slipped this out.

25:54.339 --> 25:56.551
- Nice work, Futturman.
- Yep.

25:56.552 --> 25:58.972
Well, time to get back
to the NAG.

25:58.973 --> 26:00.726
Oh, you're gonna love it.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.607
Fresh water three times a week,
air that actually moves.

26:03.608 --> 26:05.151
We got a toothbrush!

26:05.152 --> 26:06.655
Uh, of course, I gotta run it

26:06.656 --> 26:08.449
by the ol' balls and chains
first.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.411
Hey, no, no, no.

26:10.412 --> 26:12.332
No, Pointed Circle
was plotting an attack.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.921
And Athena's still at large,
and--and this Achilles guy...

26:14.922 --> 26:16.800
I'm not hearing
any tool names.

26:16.801 --> 26:18.679
Sounds like a Mons problem
to me.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.473
No, it's--
it's an everyone problem.

26:20.474 --> 26:22.352
"12 Monkeys" me said they're
gonna break the armistice,

26:22.353 --> 26:25.400
which means absolute danger
for both the NAG and the Mons.

26:25.401 --> 26:27.153
Didn't he also say
he was receiving gifts

26:27.154 --> 26:28.782
- from The Black?
- Well, yeah...

26:28.783 --> 26:30.076
We're safe in the NAG.

26:30.077 --> 26:32.748
It can be home for all of us.

26:34.502 --> 26:36.506
I am not taking
that sewer mushroom test again.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.552
Well, you probably
won't have to.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.848
- But don't quote me on it.
- I'm not going with you.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.062
- There's still a mission.
- Oh, come on, Tiger.

26:44.063 --> 26:46.483
This isn't our fight.
We already fought our war,

26:46.484 --> 26:48.237
and as far as I'm concerned
we won.

26:48.238 --> 26:50.241
Okay, okay.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.329
The NAG might be
second-rate now,

26:52.330 --> 26:54.166
but it's a start.

26:54.167 --> 26:56.504
Yeah, a start
to you settling.

26:56.505 --> 26:59.217
I'm not gonna go play house
in that dump

26:59.218 --> 27:01.263
while Josh is still in danger,
okay?

27:01.264 --> 27:02.933
This is the only Josh
they have left.

27:02.934 --> 27:04.604
They are gonna be
coming after it

27:04.605 --> 27:05.689
- harder than ever.
- "It"?

27:05.690 --> 27:07.651
Him, whatever.

27:07.652 --> 27:09.864
I've gotta get to Athena.
He should go with you.

27:09.865 --> 27:12.118
He'll be safer.
I pulled these off two guards--

27:12.119 --> 27:13.830
it's how they communicate
in secret.

27:13.831 --> 27:15.166
Must be some sort of

27:15.167 --> 27:16.878
ultra-low-frequency
transponder.

27:16.879 --> 27:19.759
Those are pagers.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.930
My dad used to have one.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.852
8-0-0

27:24.853 --> 27:26.188
8-5.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.069
"Boobs."

27:29.070 --> 27:30.906
- Good one.
- All right, so when we want

27:30.907 --> 27:32.242
to talk,
we'll "boobs" each other

27:32.243 --> 27:33.995
and we meet
at Josh's piss hole.

27:33.996 --> 27:35.456
- That's Rendezvous Point Alpha.
- Do you have to make

27:35.457 --> 27:37.127
"Josh's piss hole"
Rendezvous...

27:37.128 --> 27:38.630
Rendezvous
Point Alpha.

27:38.631 --> 27:40.968
Well...

27:40.969 --> 27:43.515
guess this is goodbye.

27:43.516 --> 27:44.809
Yep.

27:44.810 --> 27:47.105
- For now.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:47.106 --> 27:48.817
Yeah.
For now.

27:58.086 --> 27:59.672
Oh, hey.

27:59.673 --> 28:01.341
Don't let that room
full of dead yous

28:01.342 --> 28:03.137
make you feel
more insignificant

28:03.138 --> 28:04.891
- than you already are.
- Thanks.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.103
You gotta live your life,
and if that means

28:07.104 --> 28:09.692
some other people like you,
or who look like you,

28:09.693 --> 28:11.654
or who even are you,

28:11.655 --> 28:14.284
have to suffer or die
or be forgotten

28:14.285 --> 28:16.038
while you take their place,

28:16.039 --> 28:17.666
well, that's not on you.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.211
That's on them.

28:19.212 --> 28:22.258
AKA, the other yous.

28:23.261 --> 28:26.099
My point is...

28:26.100 --> 28:28.395
we're all just trying
to survive.

28:36.914 --> 28:39.544
Yeah.

28:39.545 --> 28:42.591
I guess I did survive.

28:42.592 --> 28:45.096
I'm the Josh that lived.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.606
I'm J1.
