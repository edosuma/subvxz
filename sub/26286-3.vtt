WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.704
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.737 --> 00:05.506
I don't like talking
about the war.

00:05.539 --> 00:06.940
But I like talking to you.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.979
JASPER:
At your weight,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.882
the chances of a successful
pregnancy are very slim,

00:14.915 --> 00:16.850
even if you go through
in vitro.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.052
REBECCA:
Why would you take that risk?

00:18.086 --> 00:19.987
Because I want to.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.922
I want to look at the baby
in his face, and I want to...

00:21.955 --> 00:23.224
I want to see Toby.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.393
I want to see myself.
I want to see...

00:25.426 --> 00:27.395
I want to see Dad.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.696
RANDALL:
She said she was the only one

00:28.729 --> 00:29.963
who could pass on
a piece of Dad?

00:32.933 --> 00:35.336
("Poor Little Fool"
by Ricky Nelson playing)

00:35.369 --> 00:37.738
Rebecca,
your father's coming home.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.973
Clean up your toys.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.413
Hi, honey.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.615
-Just fine.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.751
* That hastened at my call

00:50.784 --> 00:53.721
* But when I met
that little girl *

00:53.754 --> 00:56.056
* I knew that I would fall

00:56.090 --> 00:57.358
* Poor little fool

00:57.391 --> 00:59.393
* Oh, yeah

00:59.427 --> 01:01.729
* I was a fool

01:01.762 --> 01:03.264
Hi, honey.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.032
-Totally fine.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.234
* Poor little fool *

01:06.267 --> 01:08.102
* I was a fool, oh, yeah *

01:08.136 --> 01:10.804
* She played around

01:10.838 --> 01:12.773
* And teased me

01:12.806 --> 01:15.143
* With her carefree devil eyes

01:15.176 --> 01:18.246
* She'd hold me close
and kiss me *

01:18.279 --> 01:21.048
* But her heart was full
of lies *

01:21.081 --> 01:24.618
* Poor little fool, oh, yeah

01:24.652 --> 01:28.389
* I was a fool, uh-huh

01:28.422 --> 01:30.023
* Oh, oh, poor little fool... *

01:41.502 --> 01:43.504
Can I help you, Rebecca?

01:54.282 --> 01:57.318
Don't force it.
Let the teeth do the work.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.354
Okay.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.025
Thank you.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.130
Don't pay attention
to any of them.

02:10.164 --> 02:13.267
: They've never seen
anyone like you before.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.603
They never will again.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.844
Alan?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.446
What are you doing here?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.649
Rebecca, uh, I've spent...

02:28.682 --> 02:31.619
every day of the last
three years thinking about you.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.456
And I-I was dying to call you
or to write to you, but...

02:35.489 --> 02:37.525
I told you not to.

02:37.558 --> 02:41.195
Look, I-I know you've probably
moved on with your life.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.664
But the truth is,

02:43.697 --> 02:45.566
Rebecca,

02:45.599 --> 02:48.669
I've never seen anyone like you.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.472
And I never will again.

02:51.505 --> 02:55.243
:
You need a new line.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.711
That one worked well
for me once.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.881
Yeah, it did.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.435
Come in. Come in, come in.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.460
The ABM basically would allow

03:46.494 --> 03:49.129
each side to have one ABM site

03:49.162 --> 03:51.064
somewhere in the heart
of the nation

03:51.098 --> 03:53.767
and the other
around the capital.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.270
The United States,
of course, has nothing.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.406
No ABM system around Washington.

03:58.439 --> 04:02.142
The Soviet Union does have one
around Moscow.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.579
What we are witnessing
is basically the entire process

04:05.613 --> 04:08.282
for signing potentially
four documents.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.284
What is this, a pickle parade?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.219
Make another one.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.087
MAN :
It is quite extraordinary...

04:14.121 --> 04:15.989
Mom, leave it.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.827
-It's fine, Jack.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.995
No, really, it's not fine.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.165
Mom, stop. Don't-don't touch it.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.004
Think you're a big man
now you went to war?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.907
What a help you were
to your little brother.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.643
Big hero.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.183
You know what,
go pack your things.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.185
You're leaving.
-Jack, stop.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.587
You can pack your things,

04:46.620 --> 04:47.921
and I'll get you settled
someplace new.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.990
Or you can stay,
and I'll kill him.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.628
One way or another,
this ends right now.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.205
*

05:14.047 --> 05:16.183
I wanted to come back, have
everything go back to normal.

05:16.216 --> 05:19.953
The girl of my dreams is gonna
be waiting for me out there.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.656
She's gonna be wearing
a yellow dress.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.392
She's gonna have flowers
in her hair.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.159
She's gonna be waiting

05:26.193 --> 05:29.363
for someone
who no longer exists.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.920
Kev, you're a freaking
movie star.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.927
KATE:
What's that word that they use

05:59.960 --> 06:01.929
-when they talk
about Daniel Day

06:01.962 --> 06:03.230
Gravitas.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.599
Kev. Kev had gravitas.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.435
-He did. He was unbelievable.
-I...

06:07.468 --> 06:10.771
Yo, uh, Kev told me
about the IVF.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.674
Yeah. Yeah, we're doing it.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.676
The hormone shots.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.177
The works.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.712
And the egg retrieval's
next week.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.914
-It's a long shot, for sure.
-Right.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.518
-But I feel like we have
to at least try.
-Right.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.920
What, because you think
that having a biological child

06:26.954 --> 06:29.590
is the only way
to pass on a piece of Dad?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.891
N... Okay, I don't...

06:30.924 --> 06:32.626
Those were not the words
that I used.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.228
Right. So I do or I don't
have a piece of Dad in me?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.931
Randall, obviously you do.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.199
And of course Toby and I

06:39.232 --> 06:40.768
would consider adoption
if it came to that.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.870
"If it came to that"? Nice.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.239
-I think you're overreacting.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.608
Because you're telling me
you'd rather pay

06:47.641 --> 06:49.743
tens of thousands of dollars

06:49.777 --> 06:50.878
for a dangerous,
invasive surgery

06:50.911 --> 06:52.245
rather than adopt one
of the millions

06:52.279 --> 06:53.981
of children out there
that needs a home?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.784
You had two biological children
before you adopted, Randall.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.086
-That's a completely
different situation.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.988
Why, because it was easy
for Beth to get pregnant?

07:01.021 --> 07:03.090
Good for her.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.293
It hasn't been for me.
It's been very, very hard.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.061
-I know that, Kate.
-No, you don't.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.631
You don't. You don't know
what it's like to want this

07:10.664 --> 07:12.600
as badly as I do,
and you don't...

07:12.633 --> 07:14.668
know what it's like
to lose a baby, either.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.303
-Kate, stop.
-No.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.138
How dare you throw adoption
in my face right now?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.841
And how dare you make me defend
wanting this?

07:20.874 --> 07:22.442
-Hey, Kate, come on, I...
: No.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.444
No.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.379
Kate, I...

07:31.318 --> 07:32.653
Okay, come on, Mom.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.955
I can't do it, Jack.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.325
Yes, you can.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.760
Look, Cheryl said you can stay

07:39.793 --> 07:41.328
as long as you need.
She's happy to have the company.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.201
Mom...

07:48.235 --> 07:51.004
you deserve more
than what's in that house.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.276
Come on. Come on.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.945
We're bringing Cheryl
a coffee cake.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.647
-Mom, we don't need to...
-Jack, please.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.717
I don't want
to show up empty-handed.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.557
Okay, coffee cake it is.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.799
Rebecca, it is so good
to see you.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.635
It's so good to see you, too,
Mrs. Phillips.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.403
Yeah, I do have to admit,

08:23.436 --> 08:25.639
when Alan told us
that he was coming back for you,

08:25.673 --> 08:26.874
I thought he was nuts.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.075
-ALAN: Mom.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.077
I mean, he had no idea

08:30.110 --> 08:31.511
if you were gonna take him back.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.413
He has a whole life in London.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.082
Lovely apartment, great job

08:35.115 --> 08:36.516
working for The Telegraph.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.185
I had a feeling.

08:38.218 --> 08:41.521
Your generation. You walk away
from a perfectly good life

08:41.555 --> 08:42.923
for a feeling.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.424
ALAN:
Perfectly good wasn't enough.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.559
I needed great.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.230
She is great.
You know when I knew?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.432
When you asked her
to move to London with you

08:52.465 --> 08:53.867
and she turned you down cold.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.903
-Ooh.
-Okay, we don't need to relive

08:55.936 --> 08:57.905
-that part of the story,
thank you.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.540
She wanted to find her own path
and not follow some guy

09:00.574 --> 09:02.275
halfway around the world.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.846
And I said, "Good for you."

09:05.879 --> 09:08.882
Well, I had
a pretty good role model.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.050
MR. PHILLIPS:
Oh, uh...

09:10.083 --> 09:12.119
how's the singing going,
Rebecca?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.754
Uh, it's going.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.857
There's actually a record label
out in Los Angeles

09:16.890 --> 09:18.091
called Reprise Records

09:18.125 --> 09:19.793
that liked my demo.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.294
I've been thinking
of going out there

09:21.328 --> 09:22.896
-to meet with them.
-No, you shouldn't.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.264
I-I, um...

09:25.565 --> 09:26.867
Don't go to L.A.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.102
New York
has a great music scene.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.304
And it's got soul, and...

09:31.338 --> 09:32.940
I would go with you.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.574
Listen, I-I've got this friend

09:34.608 --> 09:36.576
who's got an in
at the Village Voice.

09:36.610 --> 09:41.381
I could write during the day
and see you sing at night.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.483
We could both follow our dreams.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.890
-After you.
-Thank you.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.925
You're welcome.
See?

09:51.959 --> 09:54.762
I'd say being picked up
from the airport isn't so bad.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.930
You get some guy
to carry your bags for you,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.565
buy you baller flowers.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.967
"Baller"?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.501
I regretted it
the moment that I said it.

10:01.534 --> 10:02.936
Ooh, a shopping spree.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.672
Uh, ye-- No.
That's, you know--

10:04.705 --> 10:06.073
Those are talk show
outfits, actually.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.307
Yeah, it's been
a pretty intense week

10:07.340 --> 10:09.176
ever since the premiere,
so I had to--

10:09.209 --> 10:10.577
-Right.
-Actually, you know what, um,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.079
I have my last interview

10:12.112 --> 10:13.446
tomorrow morning;
if you want to tag along,

10:13.480 --> 10:14.581
you're more than welcome.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.116
-It could be fun.
-Uh...

10:16.149 --> 10:19.352
I don't know that vapid movie
press is really my thing.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.022
Right. No, it's fine.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.590
I mean, I'm sure
it'll be boring anyway.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.693
It's with some NPR guy
named Terry Gross.

10:25.726 --> 10:30.030
Terry Gross is not a man, Kevin.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.765
She is a goddess.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.701
Really Her?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.102
-Yeah.
-Okay, well,

10:35.135 --> 10:36.503
invitation's open.
I mean,

10:36.536 --> 10:38.105
you could tag along
if you wanted to.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.639
I know how much you hate
vapid movie press and all...

10:39.673 --> 10:41.274
-I'm coming.
-You're coming.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.743
Mm.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.280
BROWN:
Hello?

10:47.314 --> 10:50.483
Councilman Brown.
Uh, it's Randall Pearson.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.119
You're a difficult man
to get ahold of.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.154
Comes with the job, I'm afraid.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.023
I'm never at my desk.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.158
Guess it's a little different
than weather trading.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.827
Oh, you looked me up.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.494
I always take
an interest in people

11:01.528 --> 11:02.896
who take an interest in me.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.832
I'd rather you take an interest

11:04.865 --> 11:06.633
in the rec center
on 5th Street.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.136
You promised to send a
maintenance crew seven days ago.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.338
And to fix all the busted
street lights.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.673
There are a whole lot of people
who are depending on you, sir.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.175
BROWN: I hear that,
and I promise you,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.676
I will get
to your street lights,

11:16.710 --> 11:18.678
but there's an order
to the way I do things.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.481
Now, I'm sorry.
I've got another call.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.416
Council...

11:24.785 --> 11:26.920
-Looks like we're both

11:26.954 --> 11:29.089
-in a holding pattern.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.024
I am hoping tomorrow is the day

11:31.058 --> 11:33.426
that Bill finally signs off
on my proposal.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.529
He will. Hey.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.432
Who wouldn't sign off on you?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.034
I'll sign off on you
right now.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.236
That don't
even make sense.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.739
It will if you let me
demonstrate.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.842
-Mm. Ah.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.744
I texted her this afternoon.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.179
She has yet to respond.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.580
Was your text an apology?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.015
Sort of.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
-Randall.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.086
She is having surgery tomorrow,
okay?

11:59.119 --> 12:01.521
I love you, boo,
but you overstepped.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.391
And you kind of have trouble
apologizing to your siblings.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.692
What? No, I don't.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.127
Mm-hmm.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.528
Miguel says
it's because you feel

12:08.561 --> 12:09.930
like you need to be
the rock for them,

12:09.963 --> 12:12.032
and apologizing shows
vulnerability.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.301
I'm sorry, uh, Miguel's
weighing in on this now?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.702
Me, him and Toby have
a text chain.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.404
It's mostly gifs,
but, you know,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.139
sometimes we talk about how
messed up y'all are.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.141
What are you doing?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.076
Hi, Kate.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.812
Yeah. I have Randall for you.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.914
-Hold on.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.084
RANDALL :
Hi, Kate.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.220
Um, it's Randall.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.623
Look, I just wanted to, uh,

12:36.656 --> 12:39.026
wish you luck
with your surgery tomorrow.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.628
That's it?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.231
No, it's not. I...

12:44.264 --> 12:46.566
I also wanted to talk about
our conversation last week.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.901
-Oh, hold on a sec.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.602
-TOBY: I got it.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.604
-Oh, okay.
-I got it. I got it.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.944
-From Kevin.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.778
RANDALL: Hey, look, Kate,
I feel like last week, I...

12:58.812 --> 13:00.647
At Kevin's premiere,

13:00.680 --> 13:04.818
some regrettable utterances
were... uttered.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.086
-Look, what I'm...
-You know what, uh, Randall,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.787
I can't have a thing
with you right now.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.090
Mom is acting like I'm having
a triple bypass.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.025
-Mm.
-And then Kevin just sent me
flowers that you send to someone

13:12.059 --> 13:14.294
when you're worried that they're
never gonna see a flower again.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.663
Everyone in this family
is making me feel like

13:16.696 --> 13:19.432
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.168
It's really starting
to freak me out.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.803
So, um, thank you for the call,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.372
-but I'm gonna go.
-No, just wait, Kate, hey.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.540
I...

13:29.877 --> 13:31.478
Oh, wow.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.946
She sounds really scared.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.447
I know.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.850
But one of the other things
that Miguel says

13:36.884 --> 13:38.485
that you do
with your brother and sister

13:38.518 --> 13:40.053
is overreact when--
What are you doing?

13:40.087 --> 13:41.488
I'm gonna get my suitcase.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.156
I'm gonna fly to L.A.
for the surgery.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.525
Oh, my God, Miguel
is so on point.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.206
I promised myself
I wouldn't ask you

13:59.239 --> 14:01.741
to move to New York
for at least a week.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.711
Mm. You really blew it, huh?

14:06.279 --> 14:09.516
I do want to get out
of Pittsburgh.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.187
And, like you said,
New York does have soul.

14:14.221 --> 14:18.025
So... is that a yes?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.998
REBECCA:
Mm.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.934
-We should celebrate.
Let's make a toast...
-Yes. Yes.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.203
...with... grapefruit juice.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.338
I'll go get us something.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.505
I'll come.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.107
No, no. I-I could use the walk.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.575
And you should stay
with your family.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.843
I will surprise you, okay?

14:36.876 --> 14:37.911
I'll be right back.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.083
Hi, Kate.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.185
-Little nervous.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.887
Just try and relax.
Your vitals looks great.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.190
The nurse will bring you in
in just a couple of minutes.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.925
While you're in surgery,
Toby will give us

14:51.959 --> 14:53.560
a sperm sample,
and then we'll put

14:53.593 --> 14:55.062
your eggs and your sperm
together,

14:55.095 --> 14:57.530
and, hopefully,
make some embryos.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.099
-Okay.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.567
Thank you, Dr. Jasper.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.136
I'll see you in there.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.273
-Tobe, I'm freaking out.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.975
God, what if I die in there?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.909
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're not gonna die.

15:09.943 --> 15:13.713
Okay, well, if I do,
I want you to find someone.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.116
But not that bitch from your
accounting department, Sharyn.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.085
She always gives me
the stink eye.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.488
-And not Madison.
-Okay. Promise
I won't marry Madison.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.123
I'm not gonna marry
stink-eye Sharyn.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.657
I will just find myself
a committed,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.159
semi-happy relationship

15:26.193 --> 15:27.594
with someone less cool
than you, okay?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.429
-Okay.
-Deal.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.830
We're gonna bring you in now.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.665
-Okay. Oh, okay.
-Okay. Okay.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.102
-I love you.
-I love you.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.270
-Okay. Bye.
-Off you go.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.772
Okay, you're gonna do great.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.113
KEVIN:
Toby says that, uh,

15:46.146 --> 15:47.747
Kate's going into pre-op
right now.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.982
He's gonna text me
when she's done, so...

15:49.016 --> 15:51.451
I am sure she'll be fine.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.420
She's coming.
She's coming.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.989
-Hey. Hi.
-TERRY GROSS: Hey. Hi, Kevin.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.125
Hi, I'm Terry Gross.
Thanks for coming to our show.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.661
It's an honor to be here.
Terry, this is my, um, my Zoe.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.696
-Oh, hey, Zoe.
-She's a big fan.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.931
Oh, thanks, that means
so much to me.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.333
-I read your book.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.768
-It was so good.
-Oh, thank you.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.937
How-how are you so good
at finding

16:10.970 --> 16:12.972
the, um, essence of people?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.442
Oh, I guess
I'm a curious person,

16:15.475 --> 16:18.878
and I try never
to underestimate people.

16:18.911 --> 16:19.946
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.148
Kevin, we can start any time.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.283
-Yeah, I'm ready to go.
-Okay.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.285
GROSS: I found your character
so believable.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.020
You played him with this

16:27.054 --> 16:30.123
complicated mix of bravery
and vulnerability.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.725
Oh, thank you very much.
I appreciate you saying that.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.161
Your father's a veteran.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.995
He served in Vietnam, right?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.131
Uh, yes, he did.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.633
So, were you able to draw
on his experiences?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.170
Not really.
He, um...

16:43.203 --> 16:45.038
My father died when we were 17.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.640
-Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
-Thank you. Thank you.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.542
Um, so, no,
I really don't know much

16:49.576 --> 16:50.843
about what he did over there.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.346
I-I have a few photos,
I have some, uh,

16:53.380 --> 16:57.884
some letters, but I don't really
have much else.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.319
Did he see combat?

16:59.352 --> 17:03.090
No, no, he, uh...

17:05.858 --> 17:07.860
Well, he could...
he could have, actually.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.530
I don't, um...
I don't know.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.433
Where did he serve?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.602
JACK: Hey, Kev, what about
this one, the B

17:15.635 --> 17:18.505
Can I get this one instead?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.608
No, no. We're here to buy
a plane to build.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.244
Oh, this one's like
a real grenade.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.013
-I said no.
-Come on, Dad, it's awesome.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.549
-Kev, put it down.
-Fire in the hole!

17:29.582 --> 17:31.284
I said no!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.661
Wow, I don't know.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.799
A lot of men of his generation
found the war

17:46.833 --> 17:48.901
too painful to talk about,

17:48.935 --> 17:51.971
except maybe with other vets.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.974
Right.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.880
-Of course.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.315
You ready to talk
kitchen co-ops,

18:02.349 --> 18:04.884
'cause I am ready
to co-op-erate.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.254
Why don't we meet
in my office for a few?

18:07.287 --> 18:10.190
-Sure.
-Okay.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.467
What's up, Bill?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.834
Um...

18:24.471 --> 18:27.740
Beth, there is no easy way
to say this.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.642
You have worked for us
for 12 years.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.013
We have to let you go.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.015
Wait, what?

18:36.048 --> 18:38.017
It is purely a budget issue.
We have to let go

18:38.050 --> 18:39.419
of one of our senior staff.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.020
We have a separation agreement
for you.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.423
If you sign it,
we can offer you severance.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.425
Bill, I don't understand.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.660
I'm sorry, I had to
let someone go, Beth.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.198
And I'm less valuable
than Rick and Abby?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.932
It's about numbers
and productivity.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.067
Just say it, Bill.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.441
You are less valuable
than Rick and Abby

19:01.474 --> 19:02.809
to the company right now.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.012
If I could just keep
who I liked the best...

19:09.682 --> 19:12.685
BILL:
I'm sorry, Beth.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.523
What up, Tobe?
Hey, did I miss her?

19:16.556 --> 19:18.625
She just went in
about ten minutes ago.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.227
Wait a minute.
Come on, man.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.795
Did you just fly
across the country for this?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.797
Tell me you used miles.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.199
I just wanted to be here
for her.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.667
-Oh...
-Anyways,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.869
Look, I'm here now.
Whatever you need, I got you.

19:29.902 --> 19:30.903
-Oh...
-All hands on deck.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.072
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.507
-Yeah.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.775
It's time to give
your sperm sample.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.413
-This is unfortunate timing.
-Yeah.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.985
Okay, Kate, I'd like you
to count down with me from ten.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.720
Ten...

19:47.754 --> 19:51.991
BOTH:
...nine, eight, seven,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.126
six, five...

20:03.270 --> 20:04.971
*

20:25.157 --> 20:27.894
*

20:43.776 --> 20:46.579
There is no way in hell
that you should have a baby.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.154
You seriously think
you can do it?

20:55.187 --> 20:57.424
Raise a child?

20:57.457 --> 21:00.493
Yeah. Why not?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.306
Oh, you really shouldn't
eat those.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.675
Yeah, I can see that.

21:15.708 --> 21:19.178
You know, my dad
just died, so... I don't care.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.914
Come on, Kate,
you have been freaked out

21:21.948 --> 21:23.683
to have a dog
for the last 20 years,

21:23.716 --> 21:27.153
and now you want to go
and raise another human being?

21:27.186 --> 21:29.021
You're just saying this stuff.
You're just saying this stuff

21:29.055 --> 21:33.426
because you're scared,
or I'm scared, or we're scared.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.694
I don't know.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.796
Could this get
any more confusing?

21:36.829 --> 21:39.666
What are you guys
talking about?

21:39.699 --> 21:42.268
Hi there,
little future train wreck.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.103
-Stop it.
-She should know the truth.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.439
-Leave her alone.
-Enough!

21:46.473 --> 21:48.875
JACK:
Both of you.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.977
Dad?

21:51.010 --> 21:53.613
Hi, Katie girl.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.616
Terry just told me
my documentary sounded

21:56.649 --> 21:59.185
"compelling and important."

21:59.218 --> 22:00.787
Those are two
of my favorite adjectives.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.524
That's great.
That's really great.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.362
How in the hell
can I know so little

22:09.396 --> 22:11.330
about my dad's time in Vietnam?

22:11.364 --> 22:14.501
Well, it sounds like he didn't
like talking about it.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.736
It's weird, that I would never

22:16.769 --> 22:19.872
just ask him
any questions at all?

22:19.906 --> 22:21.908
Not really.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.376
You would have.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.312
Probably.

22:26.345 --> 22:30.149
But, well, I think
we're different that way.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.886
You don't overthink things.
That can be a good thing, too.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.092
Which one of these
looks the nicest to you?

22:40.126 --> 22:43.329
I don't know, maybe just pick
the most expensive one?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.599
Hmm. This one has
brandied cherries.

22:46.633 --> 22:49.035
Ma, could you please
just pick a cake?

22:58.144 --> 23:00.079
Be right back.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.519
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.355
What are you doing
on this side of town?

23:09.388 --> 23:13.726
Bringing my mom to stay with a
friend, over on Hampton Street.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.965
Is she okay?

23:18.998 --> 23:21.801
Yeah. Yeah. She will be.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.907
You never showed.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.142
I did.

23:30.176 --> 23:35.381
Saw you on your doorstep
with some guy.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.984
:
Oh.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.254
We dated for three years,
a long time ago,

23:42.288 --> 23:44.090
and I had no idea
that he was coming back.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.658
You didn't-- you don't need
to explain.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.994
I know, but I...

23:48.027 --> 23:49.962
I know.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.469
I should probably
get back to my mom.

23:56.503 --> 23:59.338
I'll make sure
you get your jacket back.

23:59.371 --> 24:02.609
Thanks.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.544
Hey, Jack?

24:06.045 --> 24:08.848
I'm moving to New York.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.083
I'm gonna try
the whole singing thing.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.952
I was gonna go out to L.A.,

24:12.985 --> 24:14.654
'cause that's where
Joni Mitchell's record label is,

24:14.687 --> 24:19.125
but I-I have this dream,

24:19.158 --> 24:22.361
and I want to give it a shot.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.363
Uh, you should.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.566
You have
a really beautiful voice.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.602
Thank you.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.205
Jack.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.975
Yeah?

24:36.008 --> 24:40.046
Do you... do you have a dream?

24:40.079 --> 24:42.148
* I lit a flame
to dance in the dark... *

24:43.583 --> 24:47.286
Sorry. Is that
a stupid question?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.688
No.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.391
No, I-I just...

24:52.424 --> 24:55.995
No one's ever really asked me
that before.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.233
Um...

25:03.703 --> 25:05.872
Right now, I-I...

25:05.905 --> 25:08.841
I just want to make sure
my mom is okay.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.477
Get her settled
at her friend's place and then,

25:11.510 --> 25:16.515
I don't know, um, a decent job,

25:16.549 --> 25:20.587
a wife, family,

25:20.620 --> 25:24.123
a house that feels nothing
like the one that I grew up in.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.431
That a stupid answer?

25:37.103 --> 25:40.439
* Love is the Buddha,
the Christ on the cross... *

25:40.472 --> 25:42.341
Bye, Rebecca.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.877
* Their tears are for us

25:44.911 --> 25:47.513
* Lies of our kind,
well, it comes at a cost *

25:47.546 --> 25:51.183
* Let's fall in love
with our telephones off *

25:51.217 --> 25:54.220
* Love's my president,
my lord and my boss *

25:54.253 --> 25:55.788
* And you'll never break me. *

26:08.735 --> 26:11.403
WILLIAM:
Where's Randall?

26:11.437 --> 26:14.040
He's upstairs.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.042
Finally getting some rest.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.077
("So What" by Miles Davis
playing faintly)

26:18.110 --> 26:20.813
Oh, God.

26:20.847 --> 26:24.116
When Kevin called me, I...

26:24.150 --> 26:28.520
If he hadn't raced out of that
play to go find him, I...

26:31.758 --> 26:34.093
I don't think I can get him
through this again.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.230
Sure you can.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.932
You're the bass.

26:42.168 --> 26:44.671
It's the quietest instrument
in the jazz quartet.

26:44.704 --> 26:48.741
The solo gets all the glory, but
the bass holds down the root.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.777
Yeah, but everybody remembers
the trumpet.

26:50.810 --> 26:55.648
Yeah, but people who really
listen, they hear the bass.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.819
There's gonna come
a time in your future

26:59.852 --> 27:02.021
where you need
to be the soloist.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.256
Put your needs front and center.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.992
Make Randall hold down
the root for a while.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.530
And when that time comes, Beth,
I want you to promise me

27:11.563 --> 27:13.465
you won't just
sit there silently,

27:13.499 --> 27:16.268
fiddling with your wedding ring,

27:16.302 --> 27:17.770
like you're trying
to remind yourself

27:17.804 --> 27:20.039
why you got married
in the first place.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.574
I was in a war.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.315
And a lot of people got hurt.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.317
So I just don't think

28:05.351 --> 28:08.520
it's really a fun game
to play, is all.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.522
That make sense to you?

28:10.556 --> 28:14.761
-Yeah.

28:18.898 --> 28:23.269
Do you want to ask me
any questions?

28:32.879 --> 28:35.514
Writing "Vietnam"
was a nice touch.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.952
Yeah. Well, it works
when they do it on Homeland.

28:39.986 --> 28:42.554
Where'd you get
all this stuff anyway?

28:42.588 --> 28:45.524
My mom gave me
this box of his stuff

28:45.557 --> 28:47.927
that survived the fire back
when I was living with her.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.764
You know, I-I thought maybe
these letters and these photos

28:51.798 --> 28:55.234
would give me some answers,
but... it was stupid.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.236
No, it wasn't.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.072
Some of these men
have to still be alive.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.507
And we can find them.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.877
See if they know
your dad's story.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.979
Why do you want to help me
so much, all of a sudden?

29:07.013 --> 29:10.149
I'm a very curious person.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.752
And I try
not to underestimate people.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.823
-Terry Gross.
-There it is.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.157
-There it is.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.426
KEVIN:
Wow.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.363
*

29:30.436 --> 29:33.806
Oh...

29:33.840 --> 29:37.643
Keep telling it to, uh, be
still, but it's not listening.

29:37.676 --> 29:41.647
I'm more of a teeth grinder,
but same difference.

29:41.680 --> 29:46.819
Oh, yeah? Is that-is that from
your, uh, your anxiety stuff?

29:48.955 --> 29:52.591
Yeah. Ever since I was a kid.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.593
I can't picture you
with anxiety.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.464
You know? The way you present.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.499
That's what we do, right?

30:00.532 --> 30:04.470
Man.

30:04.503 --> 30:09.608
I take medication
for depression.

30:09.641 --> 30:14.380
You know, without it,
life gets pretty scary.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.149
-Never would've known.
-Yeah, well...

30:17.183 --> 30:20.786
Man.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.022
Kate's never seen me
that way, though.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.791
I hope she never has to.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.996
I try to forget that Beth's seen
me crying on our bathroom floor.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.564
Never really works, though.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.035
-You know, Randall,
when the-when the...

30:36.068 --> 30:39.205
Yeah, yeah. What

30:39.238 --> 30:41.040
Your wife is having
a little trouble

30:41.073 --> 30:43.842
clearing the anesthesia
from her body.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.011
What does that mean?

30:45.044 --> 30:46.845
It just means she's taking
a little longer

30:46.879 --> 30:49.315
than we'd like
for her to wake up.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.083
It's nothing to worry about yet.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.385
I'll report back as soon
as I know anything else.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.754
Thank you.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.766
Okay. Four banana
pudding ice creams.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.835
Yep. Okay.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.904
-YOUNG KATE: Tastes so good!

31:11.938 --> 31:13.539
-Kate, you-you have
something on...

31:13.572 --> 31:15.541
-right there on your... oh!
-Dad!

31:17.910 --> 31:20.079
How great is this?

31:20.112 --> 31:22.281
What do you need a baby for?

31:22.314 --> 31:25.717
Stay here. It's nice here.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.819
He's here.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.791
Still no change?

31:35.794 --> 31:38.064
Come on, Kate.
Time to wake up now.

31:47.806 --> 31:50.042
Did I marry Zack
from Saved by the Bell?

31:50.076 --> 31:53.079
No. Someone better.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.114
Who's taller and funnier.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.950
And beardier.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.551
And you're a singer,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.421
and you're trying to be a mom.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.655
-Yeah.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.257
Too bad it's never gonna happen.

32:05.291 --> 32:08.494
Because nothing
ever works out for us.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.997
We're always under
that black cloud. Remember?

32:13.532 --> 32:15.467
Not this time.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.306
Dad?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.177
:
I have to go.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.979
I know, Katie girl.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.615
KATE:
And Kate?

32:29.648 --> 32:32.518
I know you're going through
a rough spell right now,

32:32.551 --> 32:34.686
and I'm not gonna lie to you.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.689
It's gonna last for a long time.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.492
But you'll be okay.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.228
Oh, and...

32:43.795 --> 32:46.365
...you're gonna be a mom.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.503
*

33:05.584 --> 33:07.953
Hey.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.056
Hi.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.327
Did you marry Sharyn
from Accounting?

33:15.361 --> 33:17.863
I did.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.132
But we got an annulment
as soon as you woke up.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.334
-Mm-hmm.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.002
Look who's here.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.471
Who?

33:25.504 --> 33:28.507
Randall.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.543
-No.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.179
Hey, sis.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.214
What are you doing here?

33:35.247 --> 33:38.417
I'm sorry.

33:43.021 --> 33:47.259
You have so much
Dad in you, Randall.

33:47.293 --> 33:51.397
You came across the country
to say you were sorry.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.133
That's, like,
the most Dad move ever.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.838
-JASPER: Hey, Kate.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.240
-Hey.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.341
KATE:
Fine.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.543
Did we get any eggs?

34:04.576 --> 34:06.378
We got eight.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.880
Eight?

34:08.914 --> 34:10.382
Eight is good, right?

34:10.416 --> 34:11.750
Eight is good.

34:13.085 --> 34:16.054
: So good.
You did so good.

34:16.088 --> 34:19.024
Hey, um, I'm gonna
give you two a minute,

34:19.057 --> 34:22.928
but, uh, congratulations...

34:22.961 --> 34:24.930
to both of you.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.136
:
You're gonna be an octomom.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.609
Hey, Dej.
Saw you called a bunch.

34:37.643 --> 34:42.314
Whoa, hey, slow down. I-I can't
understand what you're saying.

34:42.348 --> 34:46.485
Okay. Uh, I'll be
on the next flight.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.454
Bye.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.893
Ah, a refill?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.662
Yes, please.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.064
-Thank you.
-So...

34:59.097 --> 35:01.567
-New York.
-New York.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.203
Mmm.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.242
Would you go if you were me?

35:10.276 --> 35:12.411
You know, when I was growing up,

35:12.444 --> 35:13.979
all my friends
were playing with dolls

35:14.012 --> 35:15.947
and I was playing with worms.

35:15.981 --> 35:19.117
I wanted
to be a scientist.

35:19.151 --> 35:22.921
And my father told me that he
would only send me to college

35:22.954 --> 35:25.924
-if I was an English major.
-Hmm.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.127
And I felt I was
lucky just to go.

35:29.161 --> 35:33.098
And I was, for the times.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.367
And then I met Bob.

35:35.401 --> 35:39.538
And he was very supportive
of my having a career

35:39.571 --> 35:41.640
and did I think
he was Marlon Brando?

35:41.673 --> 35:44.376
Not exactly.

35:44.410 --> 35:50.115
But he was sweet and
he was warm and kind and...

35:50.148 --> 35:53.685
and I held on to him
because that was rare...

35:53.719 --> 35:57.055
and it still is rare.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.027
I mean, I've known
since I was 16

36:02.060 --> 36:04.963
that I didn't want to be
somebody whose entire day

36:04.996 --> 36:07.233
revolved around waiting
for their husband

36:07.266 --> 36:08.800
to get home from work.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.169
And I know that Alan would
never make me be that person.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.738
No, he wouldn't.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.845
But there's someone else.

36:19.878 --> 36:24.149
And I know next
to nothing about him.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.017
He was in Vietnam.

36:26.051 --> 36:29.988
Uh, his home life
seems really messy and sad.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.058
His dreams are nothing
like mine.

36:33.091 --> 36:36.528
I think that he would be good
to me and support me,

36:36.562 --> 36:38.397
but I have no way
of knowing for sure

36:38.430 --> 36:39.865
because I don't even
really know him.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.000
We've spent all
of four hours together.

36:42.033 --> 36:45.103
But...

36:45.136 --> 36:47.539
You have a feeling.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.208
I have a feeling.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.913
-(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

37:04.490 --> 37:06.525
How is she?

37:06.558 --> 37:08.794
She's bruised up real bad.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.897
They broke her arm,
but she'll be okay.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.232
I knew this would happen.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.268
I told that girl
time and time again,

37:16.302 --> 37:18.770
"I don't want you walking
these streets alone.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.139
"And if anyone ever tries
to take your bag or your money

37:21.172 --> 37:23.409
or whatever,
just give it to them."

37:23.442 --> 37:25.311
But she loves that damn phone.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.748
I'm gonna do something
about this.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.251
Everybody talks,

37:33.285 --> 37:35.253
but they don't
actually do anything.

37:35.287 --> 37:38.223
I'm not like everyone else.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.058
Good.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.160
Then do something.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.074
How is she?

37:56.107 --> 37:59.445
-Uh, broken arm.
-Mm.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.946
She's bruised up.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.250
What a day.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.185
Yeah.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.631
-Randall...
-These people
need someone, Beth.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.135
My dad was a superhero.

38:24.169 --> 38:27.339
Man literally saved my life
the day I was born.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.141
And he always took action.

38:30.175 --> 38:32.210
He never sat still.

38:35.847 --> 38:39.284
He was a superhero
and then he died

38:39.317 --> 38:41.353
and we've all been
scrambling ever since...

38:43.855 --> 38:46.191
...scrambling to keep him alive
however we can...

38:49.327 --> 38:53.532
...scrambling for new ways
to feel close to him.

39:09.515 --> 39:12.684
I pride myself on having
a piece of my dad in me,

39:12.718 --> 39:14.553
always have.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.822
But my dad wouldn't
have sat still.

39:16.855 --> 39:20.426
And my dad wouldn't have
just made phone calls.

39:20.459 --> 39:24.830
If this councilman won't do
his job, then maybe I can.

39:24.863 --> 39:29.034
I think I'm gonna run
against him, Beth.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.709
I got fired today, Randall.

39:55.994 --> 40:00.198
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:00.231 --> 40:04.603
You said that your mother
was staying with a friend

40:04.636 --> 40:09.407
on Hampton Street and then I...
I saw your car parked outside.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.942
* My heart...

40:10.976 --> 40:14.580
So, I thought...

40:14.613 --> 40:19.217
* Forever a little broken...

40:19.250 --> 40:22.087
I'm so sorry
I didn't bring anything.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.389
I feel terrible
arriving empty-handed.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.959
-No. You and my mom both.

40:27.993 --> 40:31.930
Nothing. Nothing. Just, uh...

40:31.963 --> 40:34.966
Should I say hi
to your mom or...?

40:35.000 --> 40:39.170
-Oh, she went out for a walk
with her friend.
-Oh.

40:39.204 --> 40:42.974
But when she gets back,
I'd like that very much.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.911
I would like that, too.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.679
* Please, please

40:47.713 --> 40:50.448
* Release me...

40:50.482 --> 40:52.684
So, that guy...

40:52.718 --> 40:57.255
Previous life.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.091
Okay.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.261
* I've spent my life... *

41:03.294 --> 41:05.631
Sorry for the mess. We...

41:05.664 --> 41:07.198
we ate dinner
and then they just...

41:07.232 --> 41:10.268
No, no, of course.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.839
* The writer of this song

41:13.872 --> 41:16.307
* And a love,
not just a longing *

41:16.341 --> 41:22.047
* In a world that is
just calling me *

41:22.080 --> 41:26.151
* To be free

41:30.321 --> 41:34.993
* Only I know

41:35.026 --> 41:39.397
* What we had between us

41:42.433 --> 41:47.906
* Some people don't believe us *

41:47.939 --> 41:52.377
* The things that
have been spoken *

41:52.410 --> 41:57.482
* Would leave
anyone heartbroken *

41:57.515 --> 42:00.351
* But never mind

42:03.354 --> 42:08.727
* I'm still a survivor *

42:08.760 --> 42:13.431
* But I'm begging
to be lighter... *

42:15.366 --> 42:18.336
Do you want to go on a drive?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.272
* It's all on me... *

42:21.306 --> 42:22.641
Where do you want to go?

42:25.944 --> 42:28.580
Los Angeles.

42:28.614 --> 42:31.116
* Please, please, please...

42:31.149 --> 42:32.918
-Yeah.

42:32.951 --> 42:34.786
Yeah, let's go to Los Angeles.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.522
* Please, please, please

42:37.555 --> 42:41.526
* Release me

42:41.559 --> 42:46.231
* I've been the best *

42:46.264 --> 42:49.768
* At doing the best that I can

42:49.801 --> 42:52.604
* I've spent my life *

42:52.638 --> 42:54.105
* In the shadow of a man.
