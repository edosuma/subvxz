Alvin!

00:45.548 --> 00:46.514
This is my jam.

00:46.549 --> 00:50.419
I swear to God, I'm gonna get backstage
and blow one of those Chipmunks!

00:50.454 --> 00:51.821
What did you just say?

00:51.889 --> 00:53.456
Yeah! <i>Least</i> one of them.

00:53.525 --> 00:54.725
Hopefully all of them.

00:54.794 --> 00:56.627
But they don't have penises, Traci.

00:56.662 --> 00:57.628
They're animatronic.

00:57.664 --> 00:59.364
Kendra, they're not animatronic.

00:59.432 --> 01:00.832
I think I heard they're mutants.

01:00.901 --> 01:03.002
They're regular Chipmunks
that got radiated.

01:03.037 --> 01:04.102
Don't care. Blowing one!

01:04.172 --> 01:06.072
Whoo!

01:06.107 --> 01:07.173
Wow.

01:07.209 --> 01:10.177
One, two, three, four.

01:11.781 --> 01:15.016
Mr. Seville, I'm new here,
so I wanted to double-check.

01:15.051 --> 01:16.751
What's your policy on groupies?

01:16.787 --> 01:17.552
Groupies?

01:17.621 --> 01:18.720
Oh, hi -- me, me!

01:18.755 --> 01:21.824
Wait a minute, are you saying
that human girl is sexually

01:21.860 --> 01:23.092
interested in the boys?

01:23.128 --> 01:24.193
That's disgusting.

01:24.229 --> 01:25.828
Get her the hell out of here.

01:25.863 --> 01:27.563
I'm gonna go pray for her soul.

01:27.598 --> 01:30.666
Wow, a real groupie, just
like other rock stars have.

01:30.735 --> 01:32.634
Don't even think about it, Alvin.

01:32.670 --> 01:33.568
It's bestiality.

01:33.604 --> 01:34.936
It's against God's plan.

01:34.971 --> 01:37.205
Theodore, we're
four-foot-high Chipmunks.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.640
We're proof that God is dead.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.015
I'm going to whack me
off a piece of that.

01:48.051 --> 01:50.485
I didn't actually think
I'd get this far.

01:50.554 --> 01:51.353
Lucky you.

01:51.388 --> 01:53.855
Yeah, you smell different
than I thought.

01:53.891 --> 01:56.725
Like, less dreamy and more gamey.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.195
Oh, well, uh, I guess we don't have to.

02:00.230 --> 02:01.929
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

02:01.998 --> 02:04.298
I talked a big game in
front of my friends.

02:04.334 --> 02:06.667
And  now
this has to happen.

02:07.804 --> 02:09.770
Oh, are you crying?

02:11.208 --> 02:12.674
I can't find your junk.

02:12.743 --> 02:13.776
Oh, hang on.

02:13.845 --> 02:15.144
My genitals retract!

02:16.881 --> 02:18.648
Oh, God. I'm going home now.

02:18.683 --> 02:19.115
Aww.

02:19.150 --> 02:21.284
Hope my friends didn't
go home without me.

02:21.319 --> 02:22.218
Ye-e-e-e-s!

02:22.287 --> 02:24.854
This is so much better
than masturbating!

02:24.889 --> 02:27.490
And Kendra thought you
were animatronic.

02:27.559 --> 02:29.326
Nope. Mutated by radiation.

02:29.361 --> 02:29.860
Yeah!

02:29.895 --> 02:30.594
High five!

02:30.663 --> 02:31.161
Yeah!

02:31.230 --> 02:32.129
This is my jam!

02:32.165 --> 02:32.963
Aww.

02:32.999 --> 02:36.067
Mom and dad couldn't afford our
Christmas presents because the

02:36.102 --> 02:37.335
price of gas is so high.

02:37.370 --> 02:38.770
But I've been extra good.

02:38.805 --> 02:41.340
Swear I'm gonna [bleep]
some [bleep] up next year.

02:41.408 --> 02:43.241
Did somebody say "energy crisis"?

02:43.310 --> 02:45.877
Not in those exact
words, Captain America.

02:45.946 --> 02:49.348
The high cost of energy is
crippling America, kids.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.150
But what can we do?

02:51.219 --> 02:54.887
We can lick this problem if
we all do our part together.

02:54.956 --> 02:56.256
Turn the dial down to 68

02:56.291 --> 02:58.424
degrees, and we'll use
less heating oil.

02:58.493 --> 02:59.892
We're not gonna do that.

02:59.961 --> 03:01.160
My feet get cold.

03:01.195 --> 03:02.695
Uh, okay. Next tip.

03:02.764 --> 03:06.065
Electronics still use energy
even when turned off.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.767
Make sure to unplug them.

03:07.802 --> 03:09.535
That sounds exhausting.

03:09.571 --> 03:10.269
Pass.

03:10.305 --> 03:14.140
Uh... clothes dryers are 20%
of a home's energy bill.

03:14.176 --> 03:16.910
Dry your laundry outdoors,
and save power.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.645
I never wait that long.

03:18.714 --> 03:20.414
Nobody's gonna do that.

03:20.449 --> 03:22.082
Oh, fine. [Bleep] you then.

03:25.221 --> 03:27.454
Sorry we couldn't afford
gifts this year, kids.

03:27.490 --> 03:28.188
That's okay.

03:28.257 --> 03:31.725
It's enough that you don't force us to
live like a bunch of broke-ass hippies.

03:31.761 --> 03:33.060
Aww.

03:34.196 --> 03:37.164
My feet are [bleep] freezing.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.833
Lassie, what's wrong, girl?

03:40.902 --> 03:42.468
Timmy fell -- oh, wrong verb?

03:43.504 --> 03:47.106
Dropped... put... spread...

03:47.141 --> 03:49.175
Timmy spread...peanut butter...

03:49.210 --> 03:51.610
on his balls...and you had to--
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lassie.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.380
<i>Let's all give a round of
applause to 6-year-old</i>

03:55.449 --> 03:58.717
<i>Bosco Albert, who's making our
flight from Atlanta to L.A. all</i>

03:58.752 --> 03:59.284
<i>by himself.</i>

03:59.987 --> 04:02.254
<i>Also, it looks like the
in-flight meal was over three</i>

04:02.289 --> 04:04.557
<i>weeks old and almost certainly
teeming with bacteria.</i>

04:04.625 --> 04:05.458
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

04:06.260 --> 04:08.294
<i>Excuse me, I need to use the --</i>

04:08.329 --> 04:10.029
<i>FAA regulations require that</i>

04:10.064 --> 04:13.099
<i>you stay in your seat with
your seatbelt fully fastened.</i>

04:13.134 --> 04:14.033
<i>This isn't happening.</i>

04:14.102 --> 04:15.368
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

04:15.403 --> 04:16.202
<i>God forgive me!</i>

04:17.272 --> 04:19.005
<i>Oh, dear, get out of the way!</i>

04:19.808 --> 04:20.906
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this</i>

04:20.942 --> 04:23.310
<i>is your captain, reminding you
that getting out of your seat</i>

04:23.378 --> 04:24.945
<i>is against f--
Aw, who am I kidding?</i>

04:24.980 --> 04:27.647
<i>I'm out of my seat squatting over
a coffee pot up here, people.</i>

04:27.683 --> 04:28.949
<i>Do what you have to do.</i>

04:30.319 --> 04:31.685
<i>Oh, God!</i>

04:37.794 --> 04:40.462
<i>I told you before, I don't
get on no damn plane.</i>

04:40.497 --> 04:42.364
<i>Oh, what's the big deal, B.A.?</i>

04:42.399 --> 04:43.598
<i>It's personal.</i>

04:43.634 --> 04:46.769
<i>Rosemary's here to share some
news with her baby daddy.</i>

04:46.837 --> 04:48.837
<i>Now, does Stan --
It's "Satan."</i>

04:48.872 --> 04:49.504
<i>Sorry.</i>

04:49.540 --> 04:51.606
<i>Does Satan know why he's here today?</i>

04:51.642 --> 04:53.675
<i>No, Lonnie, he has no idea.</i>

04:53.744 --> 04:54.877
<i>Well', let's bring him out.</i>

04:54.945 --> 04:56.244
<i>Satan.</i>

04:57.081 --> 04:57.879
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:57.915 --> 04:59.314
<i>Hi, Satan, how are you?</i>

04:59.383 --> 05:01.483
<i>I'm doing great, Lonnie, amazing.</i>

05:01.519 --> 05:03.652
<i>I'm here with my beautiful baby mama.</i>

05:03.687 --> 05:06.955
<i>Now, Satan, you and Rosemary have
raised little Adrian together.</i>

05:06.990 --> 05:08.857
<i>Happiest years of my life, Lonnie.</i>

05:08.892 --> 05:11.760
<i>But we performed a paternity
test, and I have the results</i>

05:11.795 --> 05:12.427
<i>right here.</i>

05:12.463 --> 05:13.495
<i>Say what?</i>

05:13.564 --> 05:17.065
<i>Satan, you...are... not the father.</i>

05:17.768 --> 05:18.700
<i>How could you?</i>

05:18.735 --> 05:20.769
<i>What am I gonna tell mee-maw?!</i>

05:20.804 --> 05:24.138
<i>Coming up... Joseph, you are not
the father of Mary's child.</i>

05:24.207 --> 05:25.773
<i>Ah! I told you.</i>

05:25.809 --> 05:27.342
<i>I told you that's not my kid.</i>

05:27.377 --> 05:28.510
<i>That's not my kid.</i>

05:28.545 --> 05:30.612
<i>Let's meet Jesus' real father.</i>

05:30.648 --> 05:31.079
<i>God.</i>

05:31.849 --> 05:33.215
<i>Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.</i>

05:33.250 --> 05:34.350
<i>You don't know me.</i>

05:34.418 --> 05:36.585
<i>You don't know me.</i>

05:36.620 --> 05:38.687
<i>Did you just change
back from a werewolf?</i>

05:38.723 --> 05:39.221
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:39.257 --> 05:42.892
<i>You've been licking your
balls, haven't you?</i>

05:42.961 --> 05:44.994
<i>Well, they don't lick themselves.</i>

05:45.063 --> 05:47.964
<i>Our kids have made a 180-degree
change, Ms. Poppins.</i>

05:48.000 --> 05:48.998
<i>How do you do it?</i>

05:49.034 --> 05:51.134
<i>Oh, let's just say I have my secrets.</i>

05:51.169 --> 05:51.768
<i>Ta-ta!</i>

05:51.803 --> 05:52.435
<i>Secrets?</i>

05:52.504 --> 05:54.004
<i>I don't like the sound of that.</i>

05:54.072 --> 05:56.273
<i>Oh, thank God we bought that nanny cam.</i>

05:58.010 --> 06:00.877
<i>A spoonful of sugar
will help this go down.</i>

06:00.913 --> 06:03.713
<i>Did we say she could
medicate the children?</i>

06:06.651 --> 06:09.052
Did she saw a hole in my table?

06:09.087 --> 06:10.620
<i>This room is a mess.</i>

06:10.655 --> 06:13.189
<i>Oh, great, and she's also a witch.</i>

06:13.257 --> 06:15.358
<i>Hello, police.</i>

06:17.028 --> 06:18.160
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

06:18.196 --> 06:18.993
<i>Land your umbrella!</i>

06:19.028 --> 06:20.092
<i>Put your hands over your head!</i>

06:20.128 --> 06:20.893
<i>Now, just a minute.</i>

06:20.962 --> 06:21.694
<i>Now, bitch, now!</i>

06:21.729 --> 06:23.195
<i>Such language.</i>

06:23.231 --> 06:25.097
<i>A spoonful of sugar
will help this go down.</i>

06:25.132 --> 06:26.164
<i>She's going for a gun!</i>

06:27.467 --> 06:29.367
<i>Oh, sometimes a warning
shot is quite polite.</i>

06:29.436 --> 06:30.101
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

06:30.136 --> 06:33.004
<i>But sometimes, you got to grow a dick.</i>

06:33.073 --> 06:33.838
<i>Aah!</i>

06:39.244 --> 06:40.811
<i>Hey, Woody.</i>

06:40.879 --> 06:43.113
<i>I got some wood for you to peck on.</i>

06:47.419 --> 06:48.751
<i>Woodpecker!</i>

06:48.787 --> 06:50.253
<i>you.</i>

06:54.457 --> 06:56.091
<i>This school play is so boring.</i>

06:56.160 --> 06:58.894
<i>I was literally daydreaming
about that horrible day I spent</i>

06:58.930 --> 07:00.296
<i>fly-fishing with your brother.</i>

07:00.331 --> 07:01.459
<i>Shh!</i>

07:01.579 --> 07:03.687
<i>Yeah, baby, I'm killing it tonight!</i>

07:03.807 --> 07:05.167
<i>The sex we're having is
literally so bad that I'm</i>

07:05.202 --> 07:08.036
<i>daydreaming about the time you
told me about fly-fishing during</i>

07:08.105 --> 07:09.830
<i>that boring school play.</i>

07:11.975 --> 07:14.009
<i>What were you just thinking, dear?</i>

07:14.078 --> 07:16.211
<i>What could've made him kill himself?</i>

07:16.280 --> 07:18.313
<i>Think I figured it out.</i>

07:18.348 --> 07:22.484
<i>I'm knitting a sweater
for my granddaughter.</i>

07:22.520 --> 07:25.221
<i>She's part of a human centipede.</i>

07:25.256 --> 07:28.357
<i>Gentlemen, if we properly
reconstructed this DNA, we're</i>

07:28.393 --> 07:31.761
<i>about to meet the first dinosaur
to walk the earth in 65 million</i>

07:31.830 --> 07:35.599
<i>years.</i>

07:41.240 --> 07:43.507
<i>Wow, radical place you got here, dude.</i>

07:43.575 --> 07:46.576
<i>Show me the nearest half-pipe,
'cause I'm a rebel with a</i>

07:46.645 --> 07:47.677
<i>totally rude 'tude.</i>

07:50.716 --> 07:52.415
<i>Burn it all.</i>

07:52.484 --> 07:54.050
<i>Burn it all!</i>

07:57.489 --> 08:02.325
<i>Ahh.</i>

08:02.361 --> 08:03.326
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

08:03.362 --> 08:04.694
<i>Gather 'round, Joes.</i>

08:04.730 --> 08:06.329
<i>Our orders just came though.</i>

08:06.364 --> 08:08.665
<i>What's cobra up to this time, Duke?</i>

08:08.700 --> 08:09.933
<i>No, not cobra.</i>

08:09.968 --> 08:13.135
<i>Apparently we're being
deployed to Afghanistan.</i>

08:13.204 --> 08:14.603
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

08:14.672 --> 08:15.838
<i>Yo, Joe?</i>

08:15.873 --> 08:17.406
<i>Yo, Joe!</i>

08:17.441 --> 08:20.343
<i>Who wants to jump on Google and
find out what a "Taliban" is?</i>

08:20.411 --> 08:21.943
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

08:21.979 --> 08:25.046
<i>I was concerned about your
colorful unit training my men,</i>

08:25.082 --> 08:27.949
<i>Duke, until I heard about
your experience with ruthless</i>

08:27.984 --> 08:28.983
<i>terrorist organizations.</i>

08:29.052 --> 08:31.620
<i>You can count on G.I. Joe to
keep a low profile, colonel.</i>

08:31.655 --> 08:33.956
<i>Now if you could just point
me toward the local Petco.</i>

08:33.991 --> 08:36.792
<i>Seems the flight didn't agree
with our exotic birds.</i>

08:36.827 --> 08:38.527
<i>Polly, watch the eyes!</i>

08:38.596 --> 08:39.328
<i>Aah! Ow!</i>

08:39.363 --> 08:43.265
<i>You simply knock out an enemy,
throw on his clothes, and</i>

08:43.333 --> 08:45.701
<i>"Ahoy, Matey," you're undercover.</i>

08:45.770 --> 08:46.969
<i>Questions anyone?</i>

08:47.004 --> 08:47.703
<i>Estevez?</i>

08:47.738 --> 08:49.338
<i>I'm not Estevez, sir.</i>

08:49.373 --> 08:50.072
<i>I'm Hammond.</i>

08:50.108 --> 08:51.273
<i>Oh, of course. Sorry.</i>

08:51.342 --> 08:52.374
<i>I meant you, Estevez.</i>

08:52.443 --> 08:53.542
<i>I'm Sanderson, sir.</i>

08:54.378 --> 08:57.613
<i>It's so hard to tell you guys apart
with your matching uniforms.</i>

08:57.649 --> 08:59.782
<i>Where's Estevez?</i>

08:59.817 --> 09:02.418
<i>There is no Estevez.</i>

09:03.221 --> 09:06.423
<i>Son, you shoot like that in the
field, and your enemy could</i>

09:06.458 --> 09:07.190
<i>end up dead.</i>

09:07.225 --> 09:11.161
<i>The idea is to herd them back to
the enemy line, safe and sound.</i>

09:11.196 --> 09:14.064
<i>Hey, this laser rifle's
loaded with bullets.</i>

09:14.933 --> 09:16.333
<i>Amateur hour, guys.</i>

09:16.368 --> 09:19.903
<i>Intel is suggesting the
insurgents are massing here,</i>

09:19.971 --> 09:21.071
<i>here, and here.</i>

09:21.106 --> 09:23.373
<i>'Scuse me, colonel, but
shouldn't we be more concerned</i>

09:23.441 --> 09:24.974
<i>with the enemy's weather dominator?</i>

09:25.010 --> 09:26.643
<i>It's about a million degrees outside.</i>

09:26.678 --> 09:27.477
<i>It's the desert.</i>

09:27.546 --> 09:30.447
<i>Well, then, some other kind of
dominator -- sand dominator, maybe.</i>

09:30.482 --> 09:31.181
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:31.216 --> 09:32.282
<i>Just spitballing here.</i>

09:32.317 --> 09:34.017
<i>Sir, the insurgents are moving.</i>

09:34.052 --> 09:35.752
<i>All right, send out a division.</i>

09:35.820 --> 09:39.088
<i>Y-o-o-o-o Jo-o-o-e!</i>

09:40.392 --> 09:43.826
<i>Send out a division to...
All right, this is it.</i>

09:43.862 --> 09:46.929
<i>Remember, keep your heads, and
everything will be just --</i>

09:46.998 --> 09:47.830
<i>They're shooting at us!</i>

09:47.899 --> 09:49.566
<i>Oh, my God, they're
actually shooting at us!</i>

09:49.601 --> 09:50.166
<i>Aah!</i>

09:50.202 --> 09:51.668
<i>Get out of the chopper!</i>

09:51.703 --> 09:54.571
<i>Aah!</i>

09:54.640 --> 09:57.274
<i>Move, move, move.</i>

09:57.310 --> 09:58.943
<i>Does anyone else feel
like a dumbass right now?</i>

10:00.513 --> 10:04.115
<i>Yo-o-o-o Joe!</i>

10:04.184 --> 10:05.750
<i>Oh, no!</i>

10:05.819 --> 10:06.851
<i>Great job, team.</i>

10:06.886 --> 10:10.388
<i>Those insurgents won't
know what hit them.</i>

10:10.457 --> 10:11.589
<i>Great job, team.</i>

10:11.658 --> 10:14.325
<i>Those insurgents didn't
know what hit them.</i>

10:14.394 --> 10:16.127
<i>All right, troops you got them now.</i>

10:16.196 --> 10:16.661
<i>Herd him.</i>

10:16.730 --> 10:17.866
<i>Herd him back to the line.</i>

10:17.901 --> 10:18.766
<i>Good job, team.</i>

10:18.835 --> 10:20.835
<i>He'll be turning tail any second.</i>

10:21.571 --> 10:23.772
<i>Oh, it's a [bleep] meat grinder.</i>

10:23.840 --> 10:28.310
<i>Who will protect the world from Cobra
after we've yo'd our last Joe?</i>

10:29.380 --> 10:31.013
<i>Look at those fools.</i>

10:31.048 --> 10:35.584
<i>I knew the Joes couldn't handle
the rigors of actual combat.</i>

10:36.421 --> 10:37.220
<i>What the [bleep] was that?</i>

10:37.288 --> 10:38.221
<i>We're in there!</i>

10:38.256 --> 10:39.222
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

10:39.290 --> 10:40.489
<i>What the [bleep]</i>

10:40.525 --> 10:42.292
<i>Bitch, protect your commander.</i>

10:42.327 --> 10:45.616
<i>You win this day, SEAL team 6.</i>

10:45.736 --> 10:46.890
