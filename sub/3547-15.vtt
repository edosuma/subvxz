00:00.083 --> 00:02.250
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.375 --> 00:05.166
<i>The Scavos prepared</i>
<i>for a grand opening.</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:08.333
This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to our family.

00:08.417 --> 00:11.250
<i>While Gabrielle had</i>
<i>a few too many drinks.</i>

00:11.333 --> 00:13.875
I'm gonna take a little nap, okay?

00:14.291 --> 00:17.709
<i>And a cry for help</i>
<i>made Orson lose his cool.</i>

00:17.792 --> 00:20.250
Suicide is the worst thing
that can happen to a family!

00:20.333 --> 00:22.667
<i>- Mike got arrested.</i>
- Oh, thank God.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.959
<i>And a friendship hit the rocks.</i>

00:25.041 --> 00:26.375
For the sake of our friendship...

00:26.458 --> 00:28.500
Make no mistake.
Our friendship is over.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.542
<i>Orson's mom was determined...</i>

00:30.625 --> 00:33.917
In the eyes of God,
you're the other woman.

00:34.417 --> 00:38.000
<i>...to bring Alma and Orson</i>
<i>back together.</i>

00:38.083 --> 00:40.125
<i>She raped you,</i>
<i>and your mother helped.</i>

00:40.208 --> 00:43.625
I think it's time I told you
about the night Monique died.

00:43.709 --> 00:46.000
<i>Alma became a prisoner.</i>

00:46.083 --> 00:47.333
Gloria?

00:48.000 --> 00:51.291
<i>- Bree was set up to take a fall.</i>
- Mom?

00:52.417 --> 00:56.333
<i>And Mike was finally able</i>
<i>to remember the past.</i>

01:03.250 --> 01:07.417
<i>Orson Hodge had always assumed</i>
<i>that the moment before he died,</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:10.667
<i>his entire life would</i>
<i>flash before his eyes.</i>

01:11.250 --> 01:15.250
<i>But as he fell from the roof</i>
<i>of the Fairview Memorial Hospital,</i>

01:15.333 --> 01:17.458
<i>it wasn't his life he saw.</i>

01:18.208 --> 01:21.041
<i>It was one night in particular.</i>

01:21.125 --> 01:22.458
Monique.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.417
I got wonderful news.

01:27.667 --> 01:28.959
Monique.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.250
There's been an accident.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.458
Oh, my God.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.792
- What have you done?
- It was self-defence.

01:45.875 --> 01:49.125
I came to tell her to stay away from you.
She attacked me.

01:49.208 --> 01:52.125
Mother, she's dead.

01:52.583 --> 01:53.834
I know.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.166
And I'm sorry. But what's done is done.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.792
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

02:00.875 --> 02:03.875
- No, I'll go to jail.
- You killed someone.

02:03.959 --> 02:06.041
I'm your mother. You've got to help me.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.667
But I loved her.

02:07.750 --> 02:11.500
I once lost someone I loved,
thanks to you.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.458
You owe me.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.417
Hello?

02:30.542 --> 02:31.917
Miss Polier?

02:34.375 --> 02:36.792
I got that part for the sink.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.208
Hello?

02:43.041 --> 02:44.458
Miss Polier?

02:45.417 --> 02:48.792
I'm sorry. I'm Monique's boyfriend.

02:48.875 --> 02:53.375
She's upstairs lying down.
She wasn't feeling well.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.750
I'll just finish up the sink
and get out of your hair.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.333
Look, why don't you
let me take care of that?

02:58.417 --> 03:02.000
I mean, I'm pretty handy
and it's getting late.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.667
- I don't mind staying.
- No, I've got it under control.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.709
Here, let me... Let me pay you.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.083
That should cover it.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.208
Thanks.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.166
Oh, hey.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.417
Don't forget your wrench.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.291
You handled that very well, son.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.250
Now help me find a tarp.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.542
What are you doing?

03:57.792 --> 04:01.750
You don't want her identified
through dental records, do you?

04:05.000 --> 04:10.417
I must say, I never realised
your job was so difficult.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.375
It's not enough to kill her?
You have to desecrate her body, too?

04:14.458 --> 04:16.208
Get away from her!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.125
Now look what you've done.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.291
I think my damn hip's broken.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.375
Help me.

04:36.583 --> 04:41.709
<i>Yes, Orson Hodge</i>
<i>had always assumed</i>

04:41.792 --> 04:44.041
<i>that his life would</i>
<i>flash before his eyes</i>

04:44.125 --> 04:46.250
<i>the moment before he died.</i>

04:49.959 --> 04:52.291
<i>- Luckily for Orson...</i>
- Come on!

04:52.375 --> 04:53.583
<i>...that moment...</i>

04:53.667 --> 04:57.166
- I got a pulse. Let's get him inside.
- Get a backboard and a collar.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.625
<i>...was not scheduled for today.</i>

05:46.667 --> 05:49.166
<i>The first light of sunrise.</i>

05:52.291 --> 05:54.792
<i>The sound of a cat purring.</i>

05:57.125 --> 05:59.417
<i>The smell of fresh coffee.</i>

06:01.667 --> 06:06.208
<i>Yes, there are many things</i>
<i>a housewife likes to wake up to.</i>

06:06.583 --> 06:11.125
<i>But an unexpected guest in her bed</i>
<i>is not one of them.</i>

06:12.208 --> 06:13.375
Zach?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.667
You're in your underwear.

06:17.250 --> 06:21.166
Well, I needed to put on something
to get the morning paper.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.625
You've been here all night?

06:23.709 --> 06:28.000
Sure. I'm not one of those guys
who gets up and leaves right after.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.750
- Right after what?
- Do you wanna hear me say it?

06:32.166 --> 06:35.792
Fine. You were amazing.

06:40.417 --> 06:43.375
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

06:43.667 --> 06:47.750
And this is no time to be vague.
What exactly was I amazing at?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.959
Please tell me
that once contained a mint.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.333
After a few drinks,
you told me how lonely you were,

06:59.417 --> 07:03.041
and that I was the kindest man
you'd met in a few years, and...

07:03.125 --> 07:06.417
Then you kissed me.
And then you took off your...

07:06.500 --> 07:09.667
Okay, okay, stop talking.
I'm getting nauseous.

07:11.709 --> 07:15.291
This is so great.
I have so many awesome plans for us.

07:16.375 --> 07:20.291
Us. Oh, man, it feels so good
to say that.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.583
Oh, God, here it comes.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.291
Would you like me
to hold your hair, honey?

07:25.375 --> 07:26.458
No!

07:43.583 --> 07:46.041
Hey. What are you doing?

07:46.125 --> 07:50.583
I'm lying in bed, thinking about
the opening tonight, when it hits me.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.917
- We could run out of bread sticks.
- Oh, honey.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.083
You have had, what, four hours sleep
in the past three days? You need rest.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.667
Who cares
if we run out of bread sticks?

08:00.750 --> 08:01.834
I do.

08:01.917 --> 08:03.500
Tonight's the most important night
of my life.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.834
Everything's gotta be perfect.

08:05.917 --> 08:07.458
Here. Try that.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.458
- It's good.
- No. Too salty.

08:13.083 --> 08:16.583
If they're salty, we'll sell more beer.
See? You're a genius.

08:16.667 --> 08:21.166
Don't patronise me. Oh, my God.
This is gonna be a disaster.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.959
Hey, chill out.

08:23.041 --> 08:26.458
You're acting like I did
when I was six months pregnant.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.750
Excuse me. You were hitting people.

08:28.834 --> 08:29.959
Only two.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.583
And the mailman had the good taste
never to bring that up again.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.208
- Come on. Let's go get some sleep.
- The doughmaker has to be fixed.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.583
And the chairs get delivered at noon.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.667
I know.
I'm the one that put in the order.

08:38.750 --> 08:41.917
I will handle anything
that needs to be done.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.041
And you take these
and get some sleep.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.834
Come on.
We need you at your best tonight.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.959
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm crazy.

08:55.834 --> 08:59.917
Honey glaze. Honey glaze will
cut the salt in the bread sticks.

09:00.792 --> 09:06.125
Tom, I do not need to be pregnant
to kick your ass. Now go. Go on.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.834
Andrew, you're here.

09:24.250 --> 09:28.667
- What happened to me?
- You kind of had an accident.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.333
- You fell off our ladder.
- Oh, that's right.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.166
Is Orson here?

09:39.417 --> 09:43.834
He's at the hospital,
but he's not exactly visiting.

09:45.500 --> 09:50.333
Suicide? No.
Orson would never try to kill himself.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.625
The police are wrong.
It must have been an accident.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.250
But they found his footprints
on the trunk of his car.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.417
The only reason he'd be up there
is to jump.

09:57.583 --> 10:01.333
- But why?
- Maybe he was feeling guilty.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.125
For what?

10:05.625 --> 10:09.583
Mom, I looked at that ladder.
Someone sawed through the rung.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.583
And you think...

10:11.667 --> 10:13.917
I heard you two in your room,
the other day.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.500
You told him to turn himself in or else.

10:16.583 --> 10:21.000
The next day you fall and nearly die.
You think that's a coincidence?

10:22.166 --> 10:25.291
- And you say he's just down the hall?
- Yeah, but don't worry.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.375
I told them not to let him near you.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.917
And we're gonna get you home
as soon as we can.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.250
Can I help you?

10:39.333 --> 10:42.875
I'm here to pick up my wife's
belongings. Jane Hainsworth.

10:42.959 --> 10:46.959
Oh, yes. I'm so sorry for your loss.
I'll be right back.

10:50.291 --> 10:54.291
- You doing okay?
- Not really. But having you here helps.

10:56.875 --> 10:57.959
Hey, Mrs Mayer.

10:58.041 --> 11:01.041
Andrew, what are you
doing at the hospital?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.875
You haven't heard?

11:08.375 --> 11:09.500
Hey.

11:10.667 --> 11:11.875
Susan.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.125
I just heard from Andrew
what happened.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.125
I had to come see you.

11:17.709 --> 11:20.792
- If you want me to go, I...
- No, no. Come in.

11:22.583 --> 11:25.583
I know we've been fighting,
but something like this happens,

11:25.667 --> 11:27.709
it just puts everything into perspective.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.333
I am so sorry.

11:29.542 --> 11:33.250
It was all my fault. If I hadn't got
so caught up in protecting Mike...

11:33.333 --> 11:37.083
Susan, stop. Mike is innocent.

11:37.166 --> 11:40.500
He had nothing to do
with Monique Polier's murder.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.834
- Do you know something?
- Yes.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.458
And I intend to go to the police.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.000
Oh, my God.

11:51.041 --> 11:54.125
Does this have something to do
with Orson's accident?

11:54.208 --> 11:58.417
I can't tell you right now.
You're just gonna have to trust me.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.166
Can you do that?

12:03.750 --> 12:05.166
Of course.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.250
I should let you rest.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.917
So we're back to being friends?

12:21.959 --> 12:24.000
We never really stopped.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.875
Excuse me.
These things don't belong to Jane.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.458
Are you sure?

12:32.542 --> 12:33.667
Every couple has their secrets,

12:33.750 --> 12:37.083
but I'm pretty sure
she wasn't a closet whittler.

12:41.083 --> 12:44.250
- Mike Delfino.
- These are Mike's things?

12:44.333 --> 12:46.792
Yep. Someone made a big mistake.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.750
Helen, you screwed up
the labels again.

12:54.792 --> 12:58.125
He had an engagement ring with him.
That's pretty.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.291
You know, Mike and I are good friends.

13:02.375 --> 13:05.333
I could return these things to him,
if you like.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.875
Sorry.
He'll have to pick them up himself.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.500
It's hospital policy.

13:09.583 --> 13:14.000
It's also hospital policy to put
the right labels on the right boxes.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.750
Ian, you're not gonna believe this.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.750
Bree just told me
she can prove Mike's innocent.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.083
- What?
- It's true. He's gonna be a free man.

13:22.166 --> 13:26.333
- Isn't that great?
- Yes, it's bloody fantastic.

13:29.083 --> 13:33.041
Here. I'm gonna go get Bree
some flowers. I'll be right back.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.375
No, no, that's great news.
Thank you, Doctor.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.583
So Orson's gonna pull through?

13:46.834 --> 13:48.709
You rather he didn't?

13:49.542 --> 13:54.000
No. I just don't know what he's gonna
tell the police when he wakes up.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.834
It wasn't your fault. Orson falling off
that roof was an accident, right?

13:57.917 --> 14:00.291
- Well, sort of.
- Sort of?

14:01.750 --> 14:04.375
Depending on what Orson tells them,

14:04.458 --> 14:07.375
I could get charged
with attempted murder.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.834
Well, I'm so glad she has you
to take care of her,

14:17.917 --> 14:20.625
and, of course,
your mom comes first, Andrew.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.959
And I wouldn't even ask
except we're opening tonight...

14:24.041 --> 14:25.709
Chairs are here.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.792
Oh, God, seriously?
Fantastic, thank you.

14:29.875 --> 14:30.959
It's just two quick hours

14:31.041 --> 14:33.333
and then we'll get you right back home
with your mom.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.959
Thank you, Andrew. Okay, bye-bye.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.750
Did you finish folding
the take-out menus?

14:40.458 --> 14:41.834
You never asked me to do that.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.792
I shouldn't have to tell you
every little thing. Show some initiative.

14:45.917 --> 14:49.041
Wait. Where are my chairs?
I didn't order these.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.166
- You Lynette Scavo?
- Yes.

14:51.417 --> 14:52.959
Well, then you ordered these.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.083
No, why would I order 50 highchairs
for the opening of a pizzeria?

14:56.166 --> 14:59.000
I don't know. I thought
it was one of those kiddy pizza places,

14:59.083 --> 15:00.583
with the games
and the animatronic rats.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.959
- Give me that.
- Easy there.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.792
"Animatronic rats."

15:03.875 --> 15:07.208
Where do they find you people?
Okay, okay. Here it is. See?

15:07.291 --> 15:10.000
I ordered 50 of item number 7-3...

15:12.083 --> 15:16.166
- Did we find the mistake?
- I switched the seven and the one.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.667
So we're both wrong.

15:20.125 --> 15:23.709
Now, this place opens in five hours.
How long will it take to fix this?

15:27.041 --> 15:30.333
Hi. I need to rent 50 chairs
by tonight at 5:00.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.709
What? Why not?

15:33.792 --> 15:35.375
What do you mean,
"It's bar mitzvah season"?

15:35.458 --> 15:37.375
There's no such thing.

15:37.542 --> 15:40.458
You still have five?
I will take those. Scavo.

15:40.542 --> 15:43.417
Okay, that brings us to 22.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.458
Javi, Rico, we got chairs to find.
Move it.

15:52.875 --> 15:57.208
Wow. Looks like someone crawled
into a bottle of Merlot last night.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.542
Sort of threw myself
a little birthday party.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.166
So, if you don't mind, I'd like to
get back to my dry heaving.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.792
Quick question.

16:04.875 --> 16:09.125
Was that Zach Young I saw leaving
your house at 8:00 this morning?

16:09.750 --> 16:13.625
Oh, yeah. He just came by to

16:14.542 --> 16:16.625
drop off a birthday card.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.709
Really cute, little cat with balloons.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.542
- All right, bye.
- Follow-up.

16:25.125 --> 16:29.542
Why was Zach in your driveway at 7:00
this morning, in his underwear?

16:37.500 --> 16:40.083
- We had sex last night.
- What?

16:40.166 --> 16:43.291
I mean, I think we did.
That's what he told me.

16:43.375 --> 16:46.041
- Weren't you there?
- I don't remember anything.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.375
I just woke up
and he was in bed next to me.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.959
Thanks again, Gabby. Hey, Carlos.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.542
If you don't remember,

16:56.625 --> 16:59.250
then how can you be sure
that you and Zach had sex?

16:59.333 --> 17:03.709
Well, we were both half-naked,
and there was a condom wrapper,

17:03.792 --> 17:06.625
and he said I was amazing,
which totally sounds like me.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.458
He thinks we're a couple now.
You have to help me.

17:10.542 --> 17:12.667
I am not getting involved.

17:13.917 --> 17:16.625
God, I can't believe you bagged
another neighbourhood kid.

17:16.709 --> 17:20.458
- Where are you going?
- To warn the Scavo boys.

17:30.333 --> 17:33.458
- I wanna speak to my wife.
- She's resting.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.542
If we can get back to these questions...

17:36.625 --> 17:40.667
I fell off a roof.
I need a physician, not a psychiatrist.

17:40.917 --> 17:42.125
Well, I'm afraid it's hospital policy

17:42.208 --> 17:44.667
when there's a suspected
suicide attempt.

17:44.750 --> 17:49.417
- I didn't try to kill myself.
- But you do have a certain history.

17:51.083 --> 17:54.375
You spent most of 1976
in a psychiatric hospital.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.875
I don't care to discuss that.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.333
You won't be leaving here until we do.

18:07.792 --> 18:10.166
My parents were very religious.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.166
When I was 16, my father had an affair.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.959
Caused quite a scandal at our church.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.625
<i>He became depressed.</i>
<i>He started drinking heavily.</i>

18:21.166 --> 18:25.083
<i>My mother grew concerned.</i>
<i>She didn't like leaving him alone.</i>

18:25.166 --> 18:26.667
One night she had to visit a sick friend

18:26.750 --> 18:28.667
and she asked me
to keep an eye on him,

18:28.750 --> 18:33.333
but I'd made plans with friends.
I thought I could duck out for a while.

18:33.417 --> 18:36.500
<i>When I got home,</i>
<i>I found him in the bathroom.</i>

18:41.166 --> 18:43.000
You blamed yourself?

18:44.542 --> 18:46.125
I didn't need to.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.959
Mother blamed me enough
for both of us.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.333
That must've caused quite a strain
in your relationship.

18:52.417 --> 18:53.542
Yes.

18:54.792 --> 18:59.208
But now and then she suggests
little ways I might make it up to her.

19:00.834 --> 19:04.208
Yes, I'm calling to check
on the status of a patient.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.959
Last name Hodge.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.583
What do you mean, "Which Hodge"?

19:14.792 --> 19:17.959
Gloria, thank God.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

19:18.041 --> 19:21.333
- When are you letting me out of here?
- It won't be long now.

19:21.417 --> 19:24.917
In fact, something interesting
happened last night.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.000
Orson tried to kill himself.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.000
- Oh, my goodness. Is he okay?
- He'll be fine.

19:30.083 --> 19:35.166
My point is, suicide is hardly
the act of a happily married man.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.583
Gloria, for God's sake, give it up.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.917
- He doesn't love me.
- He will, dear.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
Bree will be gone soon,

19:45.667 --> 19:49.125
and he'll need a good woman like you
to console him.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.500
What are you gonna do to Bree?

19:54.333 --> 19:56.959
Gloria? Gloria!

20:17.083 --> 20:19.500
Oh, hey, hon. Did you get some sleep?

20:19.583 --> 20:23.542
Yes. I'm still kind of groggy
from those pills, but...

20:28.542 --> 20:32.500
- And now I'm awake.
- Okay, little mix-up with the new chairs.

20:32.583 --> 20:35.125
Which you were in charge of.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.083
Okay, okay, we could point fingers.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.875
But what's important is
forgetting about what we expected,

20:39.959 --> 20:44.166
and focusing on what we have,
which isn't so bad.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.125
I mean, all the different kinds of chairs

20:47.208 --> 20:50.834
give the place a kind of bohemian vibe.

20:51.041 --> 20:55.083
Plus, if we get a lot of babies,
look, we're just totally set.

20:56.291 --> 21:00.250
Tom, I'm sorry. I am. I'm sorry. I just...

21:00.333 --> 21:03.542
I realise it's not perfect.

21:06.125 --> 21:10.083
But... Please say something.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.125
What can I say, Lynette?

21:16.208 --> 21:17.917
It is what it is.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.583
Why do I have to baby-sit Mom?

21:25.667 --> 21:27.875
All my friends are gonna
be at the opening.

21:27.959 --> 21:31.333
- Austin was gonna sneak us beer.
- Damn it, Danielle. I have to work.

21:31.417 --> 21:34.792
Our mother's lying helpless upstairs,
because her husband tried to kill her.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.917
Now, for just one night
could you try to be responsible?

21:41.667 --> 21:44.792
I liked you better
when you were a psychopath!

22:05.583 --> 22:07.041
Here you go.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.709
- Wow! You're here.
- I wouldn't have missed it.

22:11.834 --> 22:14.750
You know how I feel
about Lynette and Tom.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.750
Look, Zach, I'm glad you're here.
I've been wanting to talk, about us.

22:18.834 --> 22:24.250
Me, too. You being in my life now,
having the connection that we do,

22:24.333 --> 22:26.625
this is really the first
time that I've been

22:26.709 --> 22:28.709
happy since my mother killed herself.

22:31.750 --> 22:35.667
- Could you excuse me a second?
- Of course, baby. Hurry back.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.375
I am in hell.
I just tried to break up with Zach.

22:41.458 --> 22:44.291
The little twerp played
the dead-mommy card.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.750
You know, you can't let him
make you feel guilty.

22:45.834 --> 22:47.291
But I am guilty.

22:47.375 --> 22:51.500
I don't remember how we ended up
in bed together. Maybe I led him on.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.959
I've got to be sensitive here.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.709
- Could you threaten him for me?
- What?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.458
You know, intimidate him.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.875
Do the whole jealous, Latin,
ex-husband thing you do.

23:00.959 --> 23:02.792
Tell him if you can't have me,
nobody can.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.083
Forget it.
I'm not gonna do that to poor Zach.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.291
Hey, I am looking out for Zach, too.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.834
If I dump him,
it'll destroy him emotionally.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.959
Better to scare him off.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.417
Please?

23:18.417 --> 23:20.291
- Fine.
- Thank you.

23:20.709 --> 23:25.500
Okay, look, there he goes. Go.
Go get all cholo on his ass.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.625
- Hey, Mr Solis.
- Hey.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.750
Look, I need to talk to you about
something. It's a little awkward, but...

23:56.291 --> 23:58.709
- Mr Solis?
- What?

23:59.542 --> 24:02.792
You were just saying that
something was awkward?

24:03.709 --> 24:07.250
Never mind.
Forget that I said anything.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.417
Hey. So how'd it go?

24:13.750 --> 24:16.125
You did not have sex with Zach Young.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.458
Really? Did he tell you that?

24:18.542 --> 24:21.041
- He didn't have to.
- What?

24:21.667 --> 24:24.041
I was standing next to him at the urinal.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.792
I don't care how drunk you were,

24:25.875 --> 24:28.667
if you had sex with him,
you'd remember.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.542
Little Zach Young?

24:33.625 --> 24:36.625
Well, just how much
would I have remembered?

24:53.709 --> 24:57.959
- Hey. What are you doing here?
- I thought Bree might like some soup.

24:58.041 --> 25:00.500
It's my own special recipe.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.834
I was surprised to find you home.

25:05.917 --> 25:09.583
I thought the whole street was
going to Scavo's tonight.

25:09.667 --> 25:11.166
Well, I was supposed to go.

25:11.250 --> 25:14.291
But Andrew said I had to stay home
and baby-sit Mom.

25:14.375 --> 25:17.000
Well, that's just silly.

25:17.500 --> 25:22.709
A vibrant young lady like you should
be at the party, turning boys' heads.

25:23.834 --> 25:27.208
You go. I'll look after your mother.

25:27.834 --> 25:31.542
- You mean it?
- Just take her dinner up first.

25:31.625 --> 25:35.333
I don't think I can manage
the tray with my cane.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.542
Thanks, Grandma. You're the best.

25:39.542 --> 25:41.458
This soup smells so good.

25:41.542 --> 25:45.000
You wanna score some points,
don't say I brought it.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.875
Tell her you made it yourself.

26:21.041 --> 26:23.625
Hey! Hey!

26:27.250 --> 26:30.375
Hello! Over here!

26:47.041 --> 26:51.000
Honey, there is a line out the door.
We are gonna make a killing tonight.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.834
I'm happy for you.

26:53.083 --> 26:55.375
- For us.
- Now it's us?

26:55.458 --> 26:58.917
Because I thought I was the one
who was trying to ruin everything.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.333
Okay, look, I know I overreacted...

27:01.417 --> 27:04.583
Yes, you did, but I have customers.

27:11.458 --> 27:14.166
- Place came out great, huh?
- Sure did.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.959
Looks like the whole street's here.

27:18.041 --> 27:19.208
Yeah.

27:20.917 --> 27:25.542
Except for Orson, who fell off a roof.
You know anything about that?

27:26.709 --> 27:28.792
Why would you think that?

27:29.625 --> 27:33.250
I heard you talking to Carlos.
Now answer the question.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.542
I can't talk about it here.

27:37.125 --> 27:40.875
- It's complicated.
- It always is with you.

27:42.083 --> 27:45.417
Hey, I just had a slice of pizza.
It's pretty good.

27:45.500 --> 27:49.500
Is it really good, or are you
just pretending you had a slice?

27:50.709 --> 27:54.000
- You and I did not have sex. Admit it.
- Of course we did.

27:54.083 --> 27:58.041
Zach, how can you claim to
care about me and lie to my face?

28:01.333 --> 28:04.500
I'm sorry.
I'm tired of just being your friend.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.500
I thought if you saw me as a lover,

28:06.583 --> 28:09.500
you could think of me as a man,
not a boy.

28:09.792 --> 28:11.750
Zach, a real man is honest.

28:11.834 --> 28:15.375
All you've ever tried to do is bribe and
trick me into falling in love with you.

28:15.458 --> 28:18.166
A little advice next time?
Don't play games.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.291
Just stand up and be the kind of man

28:20.375 --> 28:23.500
a woman would be proud
to share her life with.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.083
Hello!

28:31.208 --> 28:34.041
I think it's high time to make a toast.

28:34.709 --> 28:36.458
Tom, where are you?

28:37.375 --> 28:39.500
Tom, you did it.

28:40.208 --> 28:44.875
There are a lot of people in this room
that didn't think you could pull it off.

28:44.959 --> 28:47.083
Okay, well, maybe just me.

28:47.959 --> 28:50.000
Anyway, congratulations.

28:50.875 --> 28:55.333
The pizza is excellent,
and the service is sublime.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.041
- Cheers.
- Speech!

29:00.208 --> 29:02.625
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

29:02.959 --> 29:05.625
It means everything in the world to me.

29:05.709 --> 29:07.333
I gotta tell you,
when I arrived here this afternoon

29:07.417 --> 29:09.583
and I saw these weird chairs,

29:09.667 --> 29:13.125
I thought the evening
was gonna be a total disaster.

29:13.291 --> 29:17.041
But now, when I look out,
I can't even see the chairs.

29:19.542 --> 29:23.375
I just see people eating, laughing
and having a great time.

29:24.875 --> 29:26.917
It's absolutely perfect.

29:28.750 --> 29:32.667
And none of this would have happened
without my amazing partner Lynette.

29:36.667 --> 29:37.875
Who...

29:39.959 --> 29:41.125
To...

29:45.917 --> 29:48.041
I'm sorry. I'm a little...

29:51.041 --> 29:53.500
I think what my husband
is trying to say is,

29:53.583 --> 29:57.000
if you really wanna test a marriage,
open a restaurant together.

29:57.083 --> 30:00.709
Anyway, thank you for coming.
Eat a lot and come back.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.583
'Cause our kids need braces.

30:07.709 --> 30:10.500
Actually, as long as everyone
has their glasses raised,

30:10.583 --> 30:12.959
I have something
that I would like to say.

30:13.041 --> 30:17.166
I thought of waiting
for the perfect romantic spot

30:17.250 --> 30:18.709
in which to ask this question,

30:18.792 --> 30:22.000
but being here tonight, enveloped
by so much love and warmth,

30:22.083 --> 30:26.667
I realise that
this is the perfect romantic spot.

30:30.083 --> 30:31.667
Susan Mayer...

30:32.000 --> 30:33.625
Drop the pizza.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.667
Will you make me the happiest man
in the world and be my wife?

30:42.583 --> 30:44.250
Absolutely. Yes.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.417
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.333
I have something
that I'd like to say also.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.291
Gabrielle Solis, will you marry me?

31:09.750 --> 31:12.083
No, there will be no clapping.

31:12.667 --> 31:14.792
You. Moron. Come with me.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.667
Time for your pills, Mr Hodge.

31:26.917 --> 31:30.083
It's after 6:00?
I need to speak with my wife.

31:30.166 --> 31:33.250
- What room is she in?
- Your wife checked out.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.417
- Already?
- She was very eager to get home.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.875
- Don't worry. She'll be fine.
- I have to talk to her.

31:40.959 --> 31:43.208
Oh, that reminds me,
your mother called.

31:43.291 --> 31:44.875
She said
she didn't wanna wake you up,

31:44.959 --> 31:48.000
and she wanted to make sure
we'd be keeping you overnight.

31:48.083 --> 31:50.625
Moms are like that, so protective.

31:58.208 --> 32:02.291
<i>Bree, it's me. Are you there?</i>
<i>Please pick up.</i>

32:03.542 --> 32:04.709
<i>Bree?</i>

32:06.041 --> 32:08.667
<i>Please, somebody, pick up the phone.</i>

32:11.875 --> 32:14.250
- I know that you're mad...
- I'm not mad, Zach. I'm done.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.291
- You said to be honest.
- I did not say to humiliate me.

32:17.375 --> 32:20.166
I'm sorry. All right,
I was just trying to...

32:20.250 --> 32:23.500
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to leave me alone.

32:23.583 --> 32:24.917
This friends thing isn't gonna work,

32:25.000 --> 32:26.500
'cause you're always gonna want more.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.166
And I'm never gonna love you. Ever.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.917
Twenty years from now,
when you're all middle-aged and alone,

32:33.000 --> 32:36.291
- you'll regret this.
- Okay. I'll take my chances.

32:46.583 --> 32:49.458
- Thought you might need this.
- Bless you.

32:54.542 --> 32:56.959
So how did it go with Seabiscuit?

32:57.041 --> 32:59.291
- He's devastated.
- Of course.

32:59.834 --> 33:01.375
It's my fault.

33:01.625 --> 33:06.083
I should have known he couldn't handle
the whole "let's be friends" thing.

33:06.166 --> 33:07.917
I don't blame him.

33:09.542 --> 33:12.583
I'm having kind of a hard time myself
being just your friend.

33:12.667 --> 33:16.083
Watching you with other guys,
being your confidant.

33:16.542 --> 33:19.917
Really? I think it's been nice.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.875
For you maybe.

33:23.792 --> 33:25.792
Look, seriously,
I don't know how much longer

33:25.875 --> 33:28.417
I'm gonna be able to keep this up.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.125
Wow.

33:34.875 --> 33:39.000
Well, hang in there as long as you can,
because I still need you.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.667
I'll do my best.

33:54.542 --> 33:55.625
What are you doing here?

33:55.709 --> 33:57.959
I have better things to do
than baby-sit Mom.

33:58.041 --> 34:00.000
She's fine. Gloria's watching her.

34:00.083 --> 34:01.208
What?

34:01.291 --> 34:03.417
I told you Mom's ready to go
to the cops about Orson.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.458
How could you leave her at home
with his crazy mother?

34:06.542 --> 34:08.250
She brought soup.

34:20.667 --> 34:24.125
Gloria. What are you doing here?

34:24.667 --> 34:26.834
I came to take care of you.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.542
I'm so sleepy.

34:29.834 --> 34:32.333
Good. Then the pills are working.

34:37.291 --> 34:39.875
Andrew! Danielle!

34:40.250 --> 34:41.792
They're gone.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.583
It's just us.

34:45.875 --> 34:49.041
Now, you rest, hon.

34:51.166 --> 34:55.166
I'm gonna draw you a nice, warm bath.

35:34.834 --> 35:36.166
Oh, Bree.

35:37.625 --> 35:42.250
I wish I could make you understand
how deeply I regret having to do this.

35:43.083 --> 35:46.458
Monique, that was easy.
She was a slut.

35:48.083 --> 35:49.875
You're a good woman.

35:49.959 --> 35:52.834
You didn't know
Orson already had a wife.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.750
But he did.

35:55.750 --> 35:59.166
And he made a vow to her before God.

36:01.875 --> 36:05.417
What sort of mother would I be
if I let him break it?

36:11.083 --> 36:12.458
I'm sorry.

36:14.709 --> 36:18.291
But I will not let him be
his father's son.

36:42.291 --> 36:45.083
Wake up, Mr Hodge. I've got dinner.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.291
That water's not too hot, is it?

37:00.500 --> 37:02.959
No, it's just right.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.792
Mom? You all right?

38:25.291 --> 38:26.542
Andrew.

38:47.917 --> 38:50.625
You've done this before, haven't you?

39:29.166 --> 39:31.542
- Is she all right?
- She will be.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.041
Get her some blankets
and some dry clothes.

39:35.125 --> 39:36.333
Orson?

39:39.208 --> 39:40.417
Orson!

39:46.750 --> 39:48.500
Something's wrong.

39:49.625 --> 39:52.583
I think I'm having a stroke.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.792
You need an ambulance, Mother.

39:56.792 --> 40:00.792
It's too bad there's no one here
who'd dream of calling you one.

40:11.875 --> 40:15.709
- What are you doing?
- I don't want her dying in our house.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.667
Hey, there. Are you all right?

40:43.834 --> 40:47.458
Your mother, she tried to kill me.

40:48.250 --> 40:51.917
Don't worry about her.
She's never gonna hurt you again.

40:53.125 --> 40:55.959
- And neither will Alma.
- Alma?

40:56.959 --> 40:59.125
- She's dead.
- What?

40:59.333 --> 41:02.125
I don't know what happened,
but she's gone.

41:02.208 --> 41:05.000
And she's taking our troubles with her.

41:06.709 --> 41:08.625
<i>Tomorrow morning</i>
<i>one of our neighbours</i>

41:08.709 --> 41:11.333
<i>will stumble on a gruesome surprise,</i>

41:12.417 --> 41:14.875
<i>two bodies side by side.</i>

41:21.458 --> 41:24.750
<i>The police will conclude</i>
<i>that Alma fell from the roof,</i>

41:24.834 --> 41:28.291
<i>and when my mother found her,</i>
<i>she suffered a stroke.</i>

41:32.750 --> 41:34.208
<i>When they search the house,</i>

41:34.291 --> 41:37.875
<i>they'll find the note Alma wrote</i>
<i>when she faked her suicide,</i>

41:37.959 --> 41:41.625
<i>and next to it</i>
<i>a bag containing Monique's teeth.</i>

41:45.750 --> 41:48.875
<i>In the face of such evidence,</i>
<i>they'll have no choice</i>

41:48.959 --> 41:52.041
<i>but to drop the charges</i>
<i>against Mike Delfino.</i>

42:02.834 --> 42:05.250
And then you and I are gonna
take that honeymoon

42:05.333 --> 42:07.291
we never got around to.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.667
I'd love that.

42:16.959 --> 42:21.375
What about your mother?
I mean, after all the things she's done,

42:21.458 --> 42:24.083
is she just gonna get off scot-free?

42:28.792 --> 42:32.041
Thank you, Doctor.
I know you did all you could.

42:35.667 --> 42:37.417
Good news, Mother.

42:38.709 --> 42:42.709
The doctor said your stroke
has left you completely paralysed.

42:42.959 --> 42:44.834
You can't even speak.

42:44.917 --> 42:47.583
Which means all our secrets
will be safe forever.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.333
Here's the best part.

42:52.417 --> 42:55.291
Your brain is functioning normally.

42:55.375 --> 42:58.583
So I don't have to worry
about putting you in jail.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.250
You're already there.

43:02.208 --> 43:07.917
Now, I'm gonna turn your head,
so you can watch me walk away.

43:08.875 --> 43:10.625
You don't wanna miss it,

43:10.709 --> 43:13.792
'cause it's the last time
you'll ever see me.

43:25.375 --> 43:28.667
<i>A surprising thing happened</i>
<i>to Orson Hodge</i>

43:28.750 --> 43:31.500
<i>as he left Fairview Memorial Hospital.</i>

43:33.583 --> 43:37.083
<i>His life began to flash before his eyes.</i>

43:39.583 --> 43:42.166
<i>But it wasn't his past he saw.</i>

43:43.000 --> 43:44.792
<i>It was his future.</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:50.041
<i>Ordinary suburban days</i>

43:51.083 --> 43:53.875
<i>filled with ordinary suburban moments,</i>

43:54.125 --> 43:57.917
<i>each made beautiful</i>
<i>because of the housewife by his side.</i>

44:00.834 --> 44:06.208
<i>Yes, Orson could finally envision</i>
<i>a life free from secrets and pain.</i>

44:08.959 --> 44:11.750
<i>And he couldn't wait for it to begin.</i>

44:11.834 --> 44:14.291
Honey, I'm home.
