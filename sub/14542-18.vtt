- Where's Duncan?

00:05.960 --> 00:08.189
- She's dead.
- How?

00:08.400 --> 00:11.438
The Patriots.
And we want blood.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.752
- We're moving out!
- Bass! Wait for Miles.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.958
I got the men I need, Rachel.
Don't have to listen to you anymore.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.149

- Me neither.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.276
Dad, if what he said is true...

00:36.440 --> 00:39.159
My guy translated this.
You need to see it.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.391
At least we know where
they're taking the cadets.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.195
To Austin, to take down
the Texas government

00:45.360 --> 00:48.239
and kill their president.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.998

01:05.000 --> 01:06.593
Right here.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.193
Well...

01:17.120 --> 01:18.793
We got work to do.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.315
Still got to track Monroe.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.676
So let's get to it.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.911
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.593
No.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.155
Do you even care
what they've done to me?

01:41.480 --> 01:45.678
They made me do God knows... what.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.275
I... I don't remember.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.479
Who knows what else
they can make me do, Dad?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.154
- It scares the hell out of me.
- We don't have time for this.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.596
- Come on.
- What, you want me to walk it off?

01:58.800 --> 02:00.313
Want me to tough it out?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.471
Actually, yes.
That's how I raised you.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.273
You want to save your mother,
we kill Monroe. That's it.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.630
Mom is dead.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.360
- Don't you say that.
- I'm sorry.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.397
I am, but it's true.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.315
They're never gonna
give her back to you.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.790
They're lying to you.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.396
You're lying to yourself.
But I'm here!

02:25.720 --> 02:27.552
I'm right in front of you.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.600
for a little while longer.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.477
Get back here.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.233
Don't you walk away from me.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.233
Get back here!

Miles: You said your guy
could translate this.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.189

The cadets are heading to Austin,

03:32.960 --> 03:34.871
Texas government's
on the chopping block.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.953
At least we've got a great plan.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.957
We'll just wander
around Austin aimlessly

03:41.120 --> 03:42.713
till we see some suicide bombers.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.838
I don't see what could go wrong.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.278
You want to translate it yourself,
pal, have at it.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.711
You think this is a game?

03:56.920 --> 04:00.231
Patriots take Texas, that's it.
It's over.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.472
There'll be nobody else left
around big enough to stop 'em.

ahead of us on the road.

- Let him go.

Let him go!

04:21.440 --> 04:23.590
I said, let him go.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.910
Sorry. This was the only way
to get through the door.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.035
- But I want to help you.
- You want to help us?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.031
How?

04:46.960 --> 04:49.315
Intel from Truman's office.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.076
Really?

04:56.240 --> 04:59.835
- How's your dad feel about that?
- I could care less.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.992
They sent cadets to Austin.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.318
I don't know why,
but they're headed to 19 Arnell Street.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.799
Why are you telling us this?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.873
Because whatever they're gonna do,
I need to come with you,

05:16.080 --> 05:18.549
and I want to help you stop 'em.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.991
Are you joking?

05:24.320 --> 05:26.709
After all the times
you screwed us over.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.474
She's got a great point.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.796
Yeah, I know she does.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.519
And right now I'm about the last guy
you should be trusting.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.755
You have any idea what that is?

05:46.920 --> 05:48.718
Yeah.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.440
We've seen one or two of 'em.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.114
That's what those sons of bitches
did to me.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.590
That and a lot more.

I know I got nothing here,
nothing but burned bridges.

And I know there's no reason
for you to take me, but I'm asking.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.080
And I can help.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.680
I need payback.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.319
Monroe: And how do we know
this isn't a trick?

06:14.480 --> 06:17.393
How do we know you're
not zombified right now?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.557
You don't.

06:19.720 --> 06:24.749
But if I step out
of line just an inch, shoot me.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.636
Seriously?
Are you actually considering this?

06:33.800 --> 06:36.440
Well, this kid could come in handy.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.229
And it's like he said,

he makes one wrong move,
we shoot him.

- How's your dad?
- You know how they say

07:13.880 --> 07:17.635

07:17.800 --> 07:20.599
He's all right.
Just needs a couple clays to heal.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.751
- Sure you don't want to come?
- What are you gonna do

07:26.960 --> 07:28.837

did he do on you?

- Charlie: They're friends of ours.

We're supposed to meet them here.

that really sets you apart?

It was how fast the fight
went out of you.

than a fat girl on prom night.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.157
You're gonna tell me where
the cadets are right now.

How about I read you your number,
and you can do their jobs for them?

If you knew my number,
you'd have already said it.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.435

Either way,
it doesn't change what you are.

That's why they got you cuffed.

how dangerous you are.

the handle so I kill you before you talk.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.079

I'm surprised you believe us.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.958
Do you mind shutting the gate?

22:11.400 --> 22:12.993
I believe you.

One, you two ain't smart enough
to make up a story that nuts.

22:17.400 --> 22:21.473
And two, you're just
confirming my suspicions, is all.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.313
Yeah? How's that?

22:23.480 --> 22:27.314
Ladies, if you wouldn't mind.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.232
- You're a dirty, old man, Frank.
- Who you calling old?

22:40.200 --> 22:44.558
So, anyway, just last night,
Senator Wyman got popped.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.793
Now, Wyman's men cornered
the shooter. It was some kid.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.439
Little bastard looked right at 'em.
Boom! Blew his own brains out.

22:53.640 --> 22:57.110
Boy was carrying California paper.

22:57.280 --> 23:01.638
Now, I know Governor Affleck ain't
been right since her husband died,

23:01.800 --> 23:05.873
but it don't make sense for her
to pull a move like that.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.633
That's 'cause she didn't.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.474
They wanted you to think
the kid was from California.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.994
The kid's a Patriot.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.713
They're gonna get you
and Cali all riled up.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.200
You're gonna rip
each other's throats out.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.715
They're gonna waltz in,
clean up the mess.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.076
It's pretty much what they did
with me in Georgia.

23:20.240 --> 23:23.471
So far, it's working.

23:23.640 --> 23:27.474
Half our Senate's screaming
for the scalps of these yoga-monkeys.

23:27.640 --> 23:32.555
And, no offense,
but why target you?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.512
I mean, aren't you out to pasture?

23:34.720 --> 23:37.314
Because I don't trust
those US bastards.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.517
And I've been loud about it.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.593
Now...
Now, it ain't just my hot air.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.549
- Now, we got facts.
- So, what's the play?

23:46.720 --> 23:51.317
I'll pay Carver a visit and
kick some sense into his scrawny ass.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.950
And I still got a lot of friends
in the right places.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.798
By the time I'm done,

23:56.960 --> 24:01.477
all of Texas will be out
for some red, white and blue blood.

24:01.640 --> 24:05.076
Those Patriot sons of bitches
have screwed with the wrong Texan.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.197
Thank you.
That is what I'm talking about.

24:07.360 --> 24:11.194
Believe me, it's my pleasure.
It'd be good to be in action again.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.759

24:12.920 --> 24:14.274
Here's to getting back in that chair.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.193

when things are going your way?

24:38.600 --> 24:40.557
Please tell me this is better
than the pity party

24:40.720 --> 24:43.997

You two are like the...

24:44.160 --> 24:46.276
Sid and Nancy of frowning.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.880
What does that mean?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.395
It means the guy that I know

24:51.560 --> 24:55.394
didn't used to sit around wringing
his hands over every decision.

24:55.560 --> 25:00.270
He used to go in there
and do what he had to do to win.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.193
But you, I mean, look--

25:03.360 --> 25:08.594

at SeaWorld. Pathetic.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.150
You done?

25:13.080 --> 25:16.391
- Rachel did this to you.
- Miles: All right, just stop.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.712
Maybe you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.793
Or maybe I know you better
than you know yourself.

What if I told you this
is not what it looks like?

25:56.280 --> 25:59.671
You're Sebastian Monroe.
You drop the gun.

Their next target's General Carver.

26:44.240 --> 26:47.198
They're gonna hit him
at the capitol building, 1:00 today.

26:47.360 --> 26:51.149
- We're letting that one happen.
- Bass, he's the president.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.755
They kill him, frame California...

26:53.960 --> 26:57.271
He had me executed, all right?
Excuse me if I hold a grudge.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.078

What do you mean Monroe's alive?
We watched him die.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.030
I put him in the ground myself.

and now with Monroe here,

I'm not gonna reschedule.

make sure he stays dead.

he's wrong.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.597
You're not just some weapon.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.790

in the last 45 minutes,

29:03.600 --> 29:05.591
and you don't seem
to care about your kids,

29:05.800 --> 29:08.314
and there is no way you
heard that wagon last night.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.951
I heard that wagon. And how
dare you say that about my kids?

29:13.120 --> 29:16.954

- Aaron...

- Just--

- Give her back to me now!
- Calm down.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.037

30:02.200 --> 30:05.318
Remember when we were
inside your head?

30:05.480 --> 30:07.517
You were in 2014,
and it was wonderful,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.877
but you wouldn't accept it.
You just kept rebelling.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.759
Well, we were inside
Priscilla's head too,

30:13.920 --> 30:15.991
but she didn't fight it.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.720
She's happier.

30:19.960 --> 30:24.875
She's in here,
making French toast for her girls.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.316
We won't hurt her.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.438
We just want to use her body
for a little while.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.354

It's one thing to hear how much you
people are preoccupied with sex.

30:47.320 --> 30:50.517
It's another to actually have it.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.839
It was nice, by the way.

31:04.520 --> 31:10.198

- What for?

and you will get Priscilla back.
