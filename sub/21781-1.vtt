It's worse to talk sometimes
than to not talk,

that passion, that love,

her out here for the first half,

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:35.020
the day she had to leave,
I thought that I would be strong

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.940
and I wouldn't cry,
but I couldn't help it.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:40.900
And I just really broke down,
and she did, too.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.340
And it made me feel really good

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.940
and I felt really bad because
I knew I had to let her go.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.620
But it made me feel really good
to know that she would

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.980

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.500
No. No chance
for Bobbi Kristina.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.820
She came in to the environment

to get worse.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.660

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:44.340
read, listened to, and acted
upon my report,

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.420
