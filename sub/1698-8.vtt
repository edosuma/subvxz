too many trips to the snack table

00:48.360 --> 00:52.599
we have a frozen yoghurt machine back
there she doesn't even use a bowl

00:53.625 --> 00:56.361
i don't,i really don't use cuz
it straight down the shoot

00:57.941 --> 01:02.906
but seriously,pregnancy has taught me
that good nutrition is no laughing matter

01:03.411 --> 01:06.056
which is why i'm gonna have
a healthy carrot right now

01:06.151 --> 01:08.666

01:30.399 --> 01:32.689
i don't really like
anything with a "rot" in it

01:34.449 --> 01:40.170
could you imagine eating you know chicken
'rot' pie ?spaghetti and 'rot' balls?i just

orange snack... it will be candy corn.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.327
carrot is not a k,is it?

01:58.296 --> 02:00.388
maybe we should get
Mack a pen and paper

02:00.668 --> 02:01.862
wouldn't help

02:07.185 --> 02:10.967
Next time you go on the show see if you
can convince Mickey to name the baby Lily?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.096
how cute would that be?

02:12.227 --> 02:17.816
oh she's so cute little Lilly

02:19.197 --> 02:19.934
i'm done

02:20.710 --> 02:26.099
good,because she's having a boy and she
probably name it Bob so Mack might has a
chance at spelling it

02:27.469 --> 02:29.617
mommy i don't like carrots

02:29.693 --> 02:30.806

and then you walked into my life,
you crunchy little creep!

04:23.376 --> 04:26.774
Mile there's only one way to pay
him back for what he did to you,

04:27.014 --> 04:29.511
chop him!chop him good!

04:29.850 --> 04:35.183
dad,i'm being serious,kids all over america
aren't eating carrots and it's all your
fault!

04:35.254 --> 04:39.058
my fault?Mile you've hated carrots
ever since you were a baby

04:39.109 --> 04:40.836
and that is your excuse?

04:40.993 --> 04:44.586
a responsible parent would've shoved it
right into my toothless little mouth,

04:44.645 --> 04:48.543
but no!you had to roll over
and give me cream spinach!

04:50.009 --> 04:52.396
what kind of father are you?!

04:53.221 --> 04:57.786

country overreacting doesn't mean you have
to

04:57.811 --> 04:59.448
i am not overreacting!

04:59.569 --> 05:06.283

intelligent solution to fix this whole
carrot situation

rational intelligent solution?

05:14.022 --> 05:17.877

School,kids have closed their story books
and are saying:

09:09.383 --> 09:13.069

say you hate the fudgy buddies

09:22.691 --> 09:26.060

like it's some international crisis.

09:41.079 --> 09:41.748

10:13.571 --> 10:16.953

10:17.229 --> 10:18.702

10:18.940 --> 10:21.620
Please be one of those funny caveman
trying to sell me car insurance!

to the press,let me handle this

10:27.257 --> 10:30.968

10:48.410 --> 10:51.016
leave Hannah...

10:54.123 --> 10:55.891
hey i got some great news for you

10:56.000 --> 11:00.250
just talked to Mack and Mickey and they're
gonna let you go back on the show tomorrow
and straight this whole mess out!

11:00.260 --> 11:05.014
oh great,so i can go back and put my big
mouth on television in front of millions of
people?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.249
why didn't i think of that?

11:06.506 --> 11:08.870
oh no,honey,now this
thing ain't gonna go away

11:08.879 --> 11:13.395
until you get back out there and undo what
you did when you tried to undo what you did
it the first time you done did it

11:14.356 --> 11:21.111
but,what if when i try to undo what i did
when i tried to undo what i did  done i do
again what i did before when i tried to
undo what i did?

11:22.159 --> 11:31.344
If you're afraid you're gonna put your foot
in your big mouth again we might need to
hire a world class expert in what I like to
call the 'double talking dosido'

11:36.152 --> 11:37.980
hello non models

11:40.577 --> 11:44.029

11:57.533 --> 11:58.700
that's easy purple

11:58.792 --> 12:00.451
no no no no no!

12:00.553 --> 12:04.442
cardinal rule of double talk:
never give a straight answer

12:04.789 --> 12:07.681
straight answers are death

12:08.348 --> 12:09.292
but it's the truth

12:10.067 --> 12:12.973
the truth is death

12:14.821 --> 12:19.059
by saying you like purple you just
alienated every other color in the rainbow

12:19.270 --> 12:26.098
you say that tomorrow and millions of
little girls in pink t-shirts are gonna
hate your guts

12:26.660 --> 12:28.801
okay then how am I supposed
to answer the question?

12:28.802 --> 12:33.527

give them the old... razzle dazzle!

12:34.486 --> 12:37.863

feel to know you care so much about my
education

12:48.620 --> 12:52.082

with Max when we were shooting hoops and...

12:52.484 --> 12:56.184

Laker tickets and was wondering if you

Pacific- Don't offend the other oceans!

13:26.661 --> 13:29.954
- the majestic mighty waters-
-nice save now take me home

13:30.163 --> 13:36.228
and I just thought about how lucky I am
to live in such a beautiful magic world

13:37.380 --> 13:41.250
so the student becomes the master my
work here is done yarda yarda yarda

13:41.737 --> 13:46.935

to unleash this...on the world!

13:48.125 --> 13:51.837

hound me about my homework

13:59.344 --> 14:03.760
that's something I'm gonna have to do for
myself and that's never gonna happen unless
you start backing off

14:03.939 --> 14:06.629
I'm sorry Jackson

14:10.256 --> 14:13.741

14:52.635 --> 14:55.295
now you're on fire so
burn me baby burn me

15:09.837 --> 15:12.119
why settle for average

15:12.409 --> 15:14.819
when you can have a dream match

15:14.877 --> 15:18.081
at last my world make sense again

15:18.400 --> 15:23.779
up is up down is down and
losers are still losers

15:24.356 --> 15:28.460
we're not losers  we're...average

15:29.115 --> 15:34.842
don't worry you average little heads boys,
nobody buys this magazine anyway

15:34.862 --> 15:37.407
-yeah
-yeah

15:40.916 --> 15:42.759
that's why I had this made

15:53.724 --> 15:57.488
so once again just to be perfectly
clear reading is a wonderful thing

15:57.840 --> 16:00.925
and I Hannah Montana strongly
recommand it to all my fans

16:00.926 --> 16:05.848
and even kids who aren't my fans because
reading is that important. Pick up nail
polish remover and floss...

16:08.246 --> 16:10.384
Sorry. I have to get
that on the way home.

16:10.781 --> 16:13.836
I should've stopped reading but
once I started it's just so darn fun

16:15.954 --> 16:16.547
the end

16:18.088 --> 16:19.263
well said

16:22.556 --> 16:25.703
you know Hannah I'm always looking for
a great book what's your favourite?

16:26.613 --> 16:27.250
my favourite?

16:27.734 --> 16:29.890
mine is the James And Giant Peach

16:29.891 --> 16:32.000
I just love the idea of a big PEACH

16:33.364 --> 16:34.554
Mack no one cares

16:35.474 --> 16:37.068
so Hannah you were saying?

16:37.626 --> 16:46.698
well you know I just...
I just love so many many many books

16:46.699 --> 16:49.858
and you know what you should see the
stack of books on my bedside table

16:49.974 --> 16:51.892
which is a gorgeous
table by the way

16:51.893 --> 16:53.790
I got it on tour in Japan

16:53.820 --> 16:55.647
yeah what a fascinating country

16:55.712 --> 17:00.345
as all the countries are in
this beautiful magic world

17:03.820 --> 17:09.377
it is, isn't it?
it's a magic world full of books

17:09.430 --> 17:10.961
and your favourite would be?

17:12.321 --> 17:15.798
well you know I don't really
like picking favourites

17:16.281 --> 17:21.326
I think of books as little..uh.. kids.
Little paperback bundles of joy!

17:23.044 --> 17:26.819
so how could you expect a
mother to pick her favourite£¿

17:26.826 --> 17:27.955
my mom did

17:28.455 --> 17:30.102
my bother Marvin

17:30.103 --> 17:34.316
who grown up to be a bald
unhappy pharmacist in long beach

17:34.360 --> 17:35.857
who looks good now mom?

17:37.149 --> 17:38.907
five days a week people

17:41.713 --> 17:45.847
so Hannah why don't we take some
questions from your fans in the audience?

17:45.848 --> 17:51.781
great I love my fans and people who aren't
my fans I love everybody in this beautiful
magic world

17:57.044 --> 18:00.737
hi I'm Isabel.and I'm confused

18:01.259 --> 18:05.911
I used to like carrots but then you
said you hated them so then I hated them

18:05.912 --> 18:09.870
then you said you liked them so...
do I like them now or not?

18:10.129 --> 18:12.749
of course carrots are wonderful

18:13.651 --> 18:17.083
then why did you say you hated them?
were you lying?

18:17.327 --> 18:21.729
uh...well Isabel that question
took a whole lot of courage

18:21.876 --> 18:25.456
and speaking of courage what about
that Washington crossing the Delaware

18:27.320 --> 18:31.573
oh oh that reminds me
what did Dela wear?

18:31.613 --> 18:34.732
Maybe a New Jersey

18:34.960 --> 18:37.220
I don't know but i'll ask her

18:39.065 --> 18:40.543
like Alaska

18:42.083 --> 18:43.563
next question

18:45.159 --> 18:50.601
I love reading but then you said that you
hated it and now you say you like it again
and..

18:50.765 --> 18:53.865
I just don't know what to do..

18:54.058 --> 18:57.867
oh no honey don't cry just cause I don't
like reading doesn't mean you don't have to

18:57.970 --> 18:59.585
so you don't like reading again!

18:59.618 --> 19:01.261
- I didn't say that!
- yes you did

19:01.885 --> 19:05.711
ok ok what I meant was-
make up your mind!

19:05.832 --> 19:08.236
you're right mommy
celebrities are flakes.

19:09.779 --> 19:11.942
you're flake  you're right

19:12.237 --> 19:15.375
seriously Hannah it..it
is a bit confusing

19:15.588 --> 19:19.695
I mean these kids look up to you, you
should just choose your words more carefully

19:19.696 --> 19:23.844
that's what I'm trying to do-
well you're not doing a very good job

19:31.151 --> 19:32.097
okay listen

19:32.957 --> 19:35.612
this is what I am not doing

19:35.934 --> 19:38.099
I'm not being straightforward
with you guys

19:38.919 --> 19:42.816
the truth is I hate carrots

19:42.927 --> 19:45.545
I always have I always will

19:45.558 --> 19:50.106
let me see a show of hands of how many of
you guys actually like every single
vegetable

19:55.450 --> 19:57.119
every vegetable?

19:57.971 --> 19:59.222
Brussel sprouts?

20:00.291 --> 20:03.713
- To be fair I didn't know that was a vegetable.
- of course you didn't that's okay that's okay

20:04.250 --> 20:09.068
and hey I love books and I wish I had
more time for reading but I don't

20:09.069 --> 20:12.122
and just because I can't
doesn't mean you shouldn't

20:12.283 --> 20:19.348
I mean if one of your friends didn't like
carrots or...didn't read much would that
stop you from eating carrots or reading?

20:19.349 --> 20:20.368
no

20:20.642 --> 20:24.553
right so don't do what I
do just because I'm famous

20:25.364 --> 20:30.722
I think what Hannah saying here is her
likes or dislikes are no more important
than yours

20:31.100 --> 20:34.280
self worth comes from
you not from others

20:40.440 --> 20:43.145
well that's right not just
another pretty face people

20:43.383 --> 20:44.826
but it is pretty, isn't it?

20:46.374 --> 20:49.152
so do you guys have any
more questions for me?

20:49.153 --> 20:50.712
I promise to be honest

20:50.713 --> 20:52.449
what's your biggest secret?

20:54.401 --> 20:58.342
okay now it's time for a
beautiful magical commercial

21:06.225 --> 21:09.023
see you tomorrow losers

21:16.768 --> 21:18.079

21:26.193 --> 21:27.796

21:32.970 --> 21:34.477

21:38.790 --> 21:43.241
average with just a hint of dumb,
this will be perfect for your next ad

21:43.993 --> 21:46.342
uh...next ad?

21:46.698 --> 21:50.746
Arvins Learning centre go
from brainless to brilliant

21:50.747 --> 21:54.277
forget it lady. you humiliated us
once and you are not gonna do it again

21:55.443 --> 21:58.609
what you call average we call real

21:58.610 --> 22:01.203
so maybe we don't look
like that guy, who does?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.097
will that guy looks like....

22:05.033 --> 22:07.626
we're not gonna apologize
for who we are- yeah

22:08.077 --> 22:09.569
and there is nothing- nothing

22:09.570 --> 22:14.088
In this world that would ever make us
compromise our integrity EVER again. - ever
again! - ÄÜ¹»ÔÙ´ÎÈÃÎÒÃÇÎª×Ô¼ºµÄÕýÖ±¶øÍ×Ð­£¡

22:15.687 --> 22:17.599

22:17.702 --> 22:21.049
- So like mildly dumb or super dumb?
