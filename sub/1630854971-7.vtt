I shouldn't have brought it up.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.199
I just got back
a couple days ago.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.591
- Yeah.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.245
Cooking dinner
for someone special?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.596
Not that it's any
of my business.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.208
- No, no, no, it's OK.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.124
Nat's actually having
her boyfriend over for lunch.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.821
- Oh, yeah.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.868
I saw them at the
Valentine's Day dance together.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.130
So cute.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.352
Thanks.
- Hey, yeah.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.877
It's nice to see Nat finally
having a crush, you know?

11:43.920 --> 11:47.315
- Hmm, it seemed like
more than that to me.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.491
- What makes you say that?
- Oh, nothing.

11:49.534 --> 11:53.147
They just seemed really smitten
with each other.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.452
- Too bad, 'cause
he lives all the way out

11:54.496 --> 11:56.324
in Metropolis,
you know?

11:56.367 --> 12:00.458
- That's not that far,
especially if he's got a car.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.201
Hold on.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.464
Wait a second.
I know that look.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.423
You better not be
scaring him away.

12:08.466 --> 12:12.122
- No, no, of course not.
You know I'm a cool dad.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.516
- OK, good,
'cause when you're that age

12:14.559 --> 12:18.563
and you're falling in love,
there's no better feeling.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.094
- Everything OK?

12:27.137 --> 12:29.226
- Yeah.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.619
The boys were at the fortress.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.229
- Doing what?

12:32.273 --> 12:33.970
- Let's just
talk about it later.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.798
You should be resting
right now.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.409
- It's not possible.
- You feeling OK?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.063
- No, I feel sick
to my stomach,

12:40.107 --> 12:42.849
not just from the chemo.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.330
Right after you left, I started
asking Peia about Bruno.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.811
And it got ugly.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.987
- I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.860
- She walked away from me
with her chemo cart

12:53.903 --> 12:55.557
to be as far away as possible

12:55.600 --> 12:57.298
because
I am a horrible human being.

12:57.341 --> 13:00.127
- Lois.
- What am I doing?

13:00.170 --> 13:01.955
She's my friend,
and I'm questioning her

13:01.998 --> 13:04.131
like she's a part
of some conspiracy.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.002
- Your gut was telling you
she knew something.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.222
- That's just it.
Ever since this diagnosis,

13:08.265 --> 13:10.659
everything feels off.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.443
I don't trust
my instincts anymore,

13:12.487 --> 13:13.923
especially as a reporter.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.186
- Lois, you've been right
this whole time.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
Bruno is hiding something,
and you're so close

13:18.362 --> 13:20.843
to figuring it out.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.585
I think you might
just need a little help.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.283
- Help from whom?

13:30.026 --> 13:34.857
- I must admit, you showing up
here caught me by surprise.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.251
- Well, I just wanted
to give you a chance

13:37.294 --> 13:39.644
to tell the world your story.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.001
- Where are you taking me?

13:52.048 --> 13:54.834
- I want you to see what I see.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.358
- A dump?

13:57.401 --> 13:59.055
- Opportunity.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.671
These are the old offices

14:06.715 --> 14:08.412
of the factory
where my mother worked in.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.981
Private entry.

14:12.025 --> 14:15.811
Separate elevator
that goes to Rickles Station.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.161
- Metro stopped that line
years ago.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.946
- [chuckles]

14:19.989 --> 14:23.036
- What?
You want to buy this place?

14:23.079 --> 14:25.125
- I already did.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.953
My whole life,

14:26.996 --> 14:29.520
I waited for things
to be better,

14:29.564 --> 14:30.957
waited for change.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.003
I don't want to wait anymore.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.833
It's time for us
to reclaim the Suicide Slums.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.838
- You single-handedly
transformed Hob's Bay.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.796
- All I'll say is

14:44.840 --> 14:47.538
I saw the potential
in things others didn't.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.932
- Well, that seems to be true
of every investment of yours.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.590
- I've been very fortunate.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.636
- Except with your hospital.

14:58.680 --> 15:03.032
According to the records
you provided my wife, um...

15:03.076 --> 15:06.906
yeah, you've invested millions
into cancer research,

15:06.949 --> 15:08.908
but to date,
you haven't made a cent.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.650
- Your point?

15:12.694 --> 15:15.915
- Every investment you've
ever made has been profitable,

15:15.958 --> 15:17.090
except for this one.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.830
- I'm saving my people.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.746
I don't need to profit
from illness.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.053
- Especially cancer.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.968
- Especially cancer.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.015
- This disease
is important to you?

15:29.058 --> 15:32.235
- People in Hob's Bay
are developing cancer

15:32.279 --> 15:34.455
at disproportionate rates.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.196
Did your wife
show you those records?

15:36.239 --> 15:37.501
- She did.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.547
She also told me
about Henry Miller

15:39.590 --> 15:42.593
and James Distefano...
- More accusations.

15:42.637 --> 15:45.118
- Two criminals
who have been experimented on.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.729
Were they also part
of your research?

15:47.772 --> 15:49.949
Because if they were,

15:49.992 --> 15:54.083
it certainly makes me wonder,
Mr. Mannheim,

15:54.127 --> 15:57.391
how far would you go
to cure this disease?

15:59.175 --> 16:01.177
- Your wife is sick.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.789
If her treatment doesn't work,
she'll likely die.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.096
So you tell me, Mr. Kent,

16:07.140 --> 16:10.099
how far would you go
to save her?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.148
- Will you just take a breath?

16:15.191 --> 16:16.279
- Why do you keep
defending them?

16:16.323 --> 16:17.498
- Look, I hate it too,

16:17.541 --> 16:18.499
but they're just trying

16:18.542 --> 16:19.674
not to make us freak out.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.023
- I'm not freaking out.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.854
Look, I know they're
hiding something from us.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.116
- What are you doing?

16:27.160 --> 16:30.119
- Mom keeps notes
on everything.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.730
- Dude,
none of this is helping.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.997
- Really?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.613
- [giggles]

16:45.656 --> 16:47.702
[door unlocks]

16:51.271 --> 16:53.621
You've got a key already?

16:53.664 --> 16:57.059
- No, your dad
loaned it to me for today.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.843
He's not back yet?

17:03.892 --> 17:07.200
Well, I guess I'll just
wait here until the movie then.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.810
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.117
I mean, I thought that it'd be
a small first step for us to--

17:12.161 --> 17:14.119
- Yeah, that's not happening.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.035
- OK, well, you don't
have to leave, Sarah.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.166
- I also don't have to hang out
with my dad's hookup.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.951
- That's not what I am.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.998
- That's what it looked like
this morning.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.913
- You know what?

17:28.917 --> 17:31.180
I know
where you're at right now.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.617
I know how it feels
to see your dad date.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.837
Sarah, it sucks,

17:35.880 --> 17:39.362
but that doesn't give you the
right to go full-on mean girl.

17:39.406 --> 17:42.278
[phone chimes]

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109
Well, your dad is stuck
at the station

17:47.153 --> 17:48.371
for the rest of the day.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.807
Movie's off.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.332
So I don't know.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.073
Take whoever you want.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.078
- Hold up.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.088
I heard it's supposed
to be funny.

18:10.741 --> 18:11.960
[knocks at door]

18:13.222 --> 18:15.094
- Oh, Mr. Johnson.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.097
- Come in.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.098
- Hi.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.275
I'm Matteo.
- Nice to meet you.

18:22.318 --> 18:25.626
That's a firm grip
you got there.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.062
[laughter]

18:27.106 --> 18:28.237
- Matteo.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.328
- Wow, um...

18:34.069 --> 18:35.723
You look stunning.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.334
- Thanks.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.293
I hope you're hungry.

18:43.165 --> 18:47.430
- Oh, man.
This lunch was phenomenal.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.171
- Dad did all the work.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.131
- Oh, you didn't have
to do all this for me, sir.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.307
- It was more for Bug.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.353
- [chuckles] Bug?
- Nat-Bug.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.312
That's what I called her
when she was little.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.966
- And for some reason,
still does.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.014
- Your parents are OK
with you making the trek

19:06.057 --> 19:07.363
back and forth
to Metropolis alone?

19:07.407 --> 19:09.365
- Yeah.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.367
I mean, they trust me.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.760
- It's not that far.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.414
- It's far enough.
- Dad--

19:14.457 --> 19:16.198
- Tell me about this party
where you met Natalie.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.244
- I mean, it was just
a couple of friends hanging.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.897
- With the parents
out of town, right?

19:19.941 --> 19:21.160
- Sir, I'm sorry
if you think that I--

19:21.203 --> 19:22.770
- No, don't apologize.

19:22.813 --> 19:23.945
Just 'cause
my dad's short-circuiting

19:23.988 --> 19:25.120
for whatever reason

19:25.164 --> 19:26.426
doesn't make that your problem.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.689
- Bug--
- Don't call me that.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.299
We're going to the movie.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.040
Thanks for ruining lunch.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.828
- Thank you for the lunch.
It was really delicious.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.630
- What part of don't follow me
do you not understand?

19:56.673 --> 19:59.937
- Peia, I am really sorry.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.899
- And now you're sitting.[scoffs]

20:07.902 --> 20:11.122
- Peia, you have every right
to be upset.

20:11.166 --> 20:15.649
I was digging for a story,
and I crossed a line.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.433
And way too often,
I let my work bleed

20:17.477 --> 20:21.045
into my personal life,
and it never ends well.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.917
It's probably something
I got from my dad.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.527
- Now it's your dad's fault?

20:24.571 --> 20:26.964
- No.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.227
This is all me.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.667
Honestly, I don't have
that many friends.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.367
And I really like you.

20:40.282 --> 20:45.896
And going through all of this
has been...

20:50.814 --> 20:52.860
Unbelievably hard.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.779
And I don't know how I could
have done it without you.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.480
- That's
what cancer friends are for.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.395
- I don't want
to just be cancer friends.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.223
I want to be friend-friends.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.877
- What does that even mean?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.140
I mean, do we need,
like, matching bracelets?

21:12.183 --> 21:13.315
- No, I was thinking necklaces.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.492
- [laughs]

21:16.536 --> 21:19.016
Lois,

21:19.060 --> 21:22.368
you and me, we're--

21:22.411 --> 21:25.458
we're from completely
different worlds.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.938
Not to mention,
we both have cancer.

21:27.982 --> 21:31.159
This isn't really the recipe
for a lifelong friendship.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.769
- I disagree.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.510
And I can be very stubborn
when I want to be.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.033
I don't know if you've noticed.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.993
- A little bit.

21:43.650 --> 21:47.131
- I promise,
no more angles, OK?

21:57.925 --> 22:00.014
- Hey, I'm sorry
to surprises you.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.059
You got a second?

22:02.103 --> 22:04.061
- Did something happen
at lunch?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.281
- [sighs] Yeah.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.022
- Let's pick this up later.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.851
- OK, sure.
- All right.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.635
- [mouths]
Oh, my God.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.465
- Was it the boyfriend?

22:16.509 --> 22:18.424
- No.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.947
- Natalie?

22:22.689 --> 22:25.213
John,
what happened to cool dad?

22:25.256 --> 22:27.041
- He never showed up.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.522
I thought that I could handle
Nat having a boyfriend,

22:29.565 --> 22:33.352
but then I saw the way
he was looking at her

22:33.395 --> 22:35.136
and the way
she was looking at him.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.790
- Aw, that's so sweet.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.531
- I just felt myself
getting really protective.

22:38.574 --> 22:41.142
It was like
this other person took over.

22:41.185 --> 22:45.364
- None of this is easy,
especially for a parent.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.802
- But it's just--

22:48.845 --> 22:53.241
it's like ever since Nat
showed up in Smallville,

22:53.284 --> 22:56.157
all I've wanted for her to do
is teenager things.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.509
Now she is, I'm terrified.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.078
- I don't know
what my dad's problem is,

23:04.121 --> 23:05.688
but that was not OK.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.473
I mean,
could he be more of a cliché?

to intimidate you.

So why do you keep acting
like I'm the bad guy?

25:05.112 --> 25:07.331

could save millions worth it?

25:16.558 --> 25:18.299
