WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.786
- Previously
on "Superman & Lois"...

00:03.829 --> 00:05.092
I was just diagnosed

00:05.135 --> 00:07.137
with stage 3
inflammatory breast cancer.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.225
- End-of-life decisions?

00:08.269 --> 00:09.574
- We need to be ready,
just in case.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.621
Bruno Mannheim
invested $200 million

00:12.664 --> 00:13.752
in Hob's Bay Medical Center.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.145
I can't prove it yet,

00:15.189 --> 00:16.625
but I think the hospital
is a cover for something.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.454
- So Mannheim is what, giving
powers to dying criminals?

00:19.497 --> 00:21.891
- But what if this
isn't about powers?

00:21.934 --> 00:24.154
What if he's actually trying
to keep these guys alive?

00:25.938 --> 00:27.157
- I'm getting worse.

00:27.201 --> 00:30.465
- Peia, I'm going to save you.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.948
- [retching]

00:42.607 --> 00:46.742
I stained another one
of your shirts.

00:46.785 --> 00:49.136
- Don't worry about it.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.707
Here.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.194
- [retching]

01:07.328 --> 01:10.287
[tense music]

01:10.331 --> 01:14.551
â™ª â™ª

01:14.596 --> 01:16.989
- OK, number four.

01:17.033 --> 01:20.645
You sure
you're well enough to go?

01:20.689 --> 01:22.430
- I hope so.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.520
- Babe, they'll postpone
if you're too sick.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.918
- I can do this.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.051
Did you pick some good podcasts
for the drive?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.053
- You know I did.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.447
- Do you need help?
- We're good.

01:42.102 --> 01:46.235
- Mom, is everything OK?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.412
- Yeah, everything's fine.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.371
We'll be home before dinner.

01:54.026 --> 01:57.073
[car doors open, close]

01:59.162 --> 02:02.383
[engine turns over]

02:02.426 --> 02:05.690
- They're not telling us
something.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.087
- Hey, which dress
do you like better?

02:12.828 --> 02:14.786
- The floral one.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.485
- Dad, come on.
Pick one.

02:17.528 --> 02:21.924
- Whichever one you like best.
- Are you gonna change?

02:21.966 --> 02:24.100
Maybe you can wear, like,
a button-down or something?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.754
God, this place is a mess.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.103
- Oh, I'll clean it up.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.322
- OK, did you get the foodalready?

02:28.365 --> 02:30.280
- Not yet.
- Dad, come on.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.934
He's gonna be here
in less than two hours.

02:33.892 --> 02:35.764
- You don't have to stress
about this.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.722
Everything is gonna be fine.

02:37.766 --> 02:40.072
It's only lunch.

02:40.116 --> 02:43.641
OK, look, I know
this is important to you,

02:43.685 --> 02:46.557
so I'll clean up,

02:46.601 --> 02:49.691
and then I'll head out.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.954
And I think you'll
look beautiful in the blue.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.435
- Maybe I'll ask Sarah.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.612
- [scoffs]

02:58.917 --> 03:00.702
- So when are you
breaking ground?

03:00.745 --> 03:03.008
That is not what you promised.

03:03.052 --> 03:06.360
OK, then I'll come down today,Scott.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.493
- Let me guess, more town hall
construction delays?

03:09.537 --> 03:11.713
- I mean, this contractor
thinks I'll back down

03:11.756 --> 03:12.975
just 'cause I'm a woman.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.499
- What? That--
[bell rings]

03:15.543 --> 03:18.198
Best of three, Soph.
- Pickup order.

03:28.251 --> 03:31.950
- Hey, I know
that Kyle talked to you,

03:31.994 --> 03:34.997
but I need you to know
that this thing between us,

03:35.040 --> 03:36.259
it just sort of happened.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.652
- I know.

03:37.695 --> 03:38.914
- There was never anythinggoing on

03:38.957 --> 03:41.351
behind your back, ever.

03:41.395 --> 03:44.572
And I wanted him to tell you
way sooner than he did,

03:44.615 --> 03:46.442
but he was just concerned
about, you know...

03:46.487 --> 03:48.228
- I appreciate it.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.838
But you don't have to worry.
We're fine.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.797
- Here you go, hon.
Egg white omelet.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.191
Order of sausage and biscuits,
extra gravy.

03:57.628 --> 04:02.372
- OK, well, um,
have a great day.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.982
- We know you already have.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.637
- Chrissy--

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
- It's OK.

04:11.555 --> 04:14.384
- What?
- Don't ever do that again.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.777
- Mom, somebody has
to say something.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.387
- None if this
is Chrissy's fault.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.822
- She's, like,
ten years younger than dad.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.084
It's gross.

04:20.129 --> 04:22.305
[line trilling]
Hey, Nat.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.441
- Everything
is making me nauseated.

04:27.484 --> 04:31.096
Also alternating between
constipation and diarrhea?

04:31.140 --> 04:34.230
Thank you for the heads-up
on that one.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.058
- Didn't want to scar him
for life.

04:36.101 --> 04:38.190
- Yeah, we are way past that.
- OK.

04:38.234 --> 04:41.498
So I asked about getting you
a new anti-nausea prescription,

04:41.542 --> 04:43.587
picked up some different
fortifying drinks to try,

04:43.631 --> 04:46.460
and here is some fresh ice.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.462
- Aw, you're lucky.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.290
He's such a caring husband.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.987
- Clark's the best.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.991
- My husband's the same way.

04:56.034 --> 04:58.994
- Yeah? How so?

04:59.037 --> 05:00.474
- Mm, just...

05:02.302 --> 05:04.869
That he'd do anything for me.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.872
You can't keep doing this,
Bruno.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.004
It's too dangerous.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.701
- It's just a dinner.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.573
- This is Moxie's restaurant.

05:12.616 --> 05:13.922
- So?

05:13.965 --> 05:16.272
I want to be with you.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.143
Why is Moxie gonna care?

05:18.187 --> 05:20.711
We both work for him.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.018
- Things aren't as easy
as when we were kids.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.715
- I know.
- No, you don't.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.195
- Then explain it to me.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.634
- I'm not the same person.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.246
Some of the things I've done...

05:34.290 --> 05:37.467
- We all had to do
what was necessary to survive.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.687
- Bruno, it is so much more
than that.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.951
- Nothing is gonna change
the way I feel about you.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.866
When I first met you,

05:44.909 --> 05:47.912
I knew that we were
meant to be together.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.827
You knew it too.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.658
- It's a bad idea.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.051
It'll never work.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.576
- Maybe not,
but you're still here.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.102
- How are your boys
handling things?

06:06.104 --> 06:07.802
- As well as can be expected.

06:07.845 --> 06:11.632
[distant whirring]

06:11.675 --> 06:13.808
- Which reminds me, I should
probably check on them.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.682
- Do you have any pics?

06:18.726 --> 06:21.206
- Yeah.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.774
- Wait, so he's never
even brought Mom to see you?

06:23.818 --> 06:26.734
- There was no need.
I discussed

06:26.777 --> 06:28.823
her condition with him,
and your father agreed.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.172
- OK, but that's not
the same as doing

06:30.215 --> 06:32.043
a diagnostic test
to make sure.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.045
I mean, when Jordan was sick
with that Kryptonite virus,

06:34.089 --> 06:36.787
that's what Holo-gramps did.
He used lasers to save him.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.572
- That was very different,
Jonathan.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.487
- How?

06:40.530 --> 06:43.272
- Jon, come on.
- What?

06:43.315 --> 06:45.492
No, dude, I'm not leaving
until I get some answers.

06:45.534 --> 06:47.450
Why can't you help our mom?

06:47.494 --> 06:49.452
- Because I don't believe
she has the proper makeup

06:49.496 --> 06:51.411
to withstand
Kryptonian procedures.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.933
- You don't believe,
or you two

06:52.977 --> 06:54.588
just assumed
because she's human?

06:54.631 --> 06:56.981
- The risk is too great.
- It's worth a shot!

06:57.025 --> 06:58.374
- My technology
could kill her.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.810
- She might die anyway!

06:59.854 --> 07:01.290
- Enough!

07:04.032 --> 07:05.337
What are you two doing here?

07:10.604 --> 07:13.084
- They wanted to know if
there was Kryptonian science

07:13.128 --> 07:14.738
that could help Lois.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.784
- You guys,
your mom is gonna be fine.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.481
- She didn't sound fine
last night.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.788
- That's just the chemo, OK?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.529
Sometimes it's hard,
but your mother can handle it.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.748
- Yeah, but what if
she didn't need to?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.271
What if there was another way?

07:28.230 --> 07:29.840
- Your mom and I have
already discussed this.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.842
- Yeah, not with us.
- Her treatment isn't

07:31.886 --> 07:34.802
for you to decide, Jonathan.
- We were just trying to help.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.151
- Which is what you should
have been here doing

07:36.194 --> 07:37.979
the entire time.
- Excuse me?

07:38.022 --> 07:40.808
- There's Kryptonian science
that we're not even using.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.549
- Jonathan,
I explained the dangers.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.072
- No, no, no,
you just explained

07:44.115 --> 07:45.377
why our dad was scared.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.118
- Dude.
- Stop it right there!

07:47.162 --> 07:48.990
I understand
you're worried about your mom,

07:49.033 --> 07:50.470
but don't you dare act
like I don't care

07:50.513 --> 07:51.906
just as much as you.

07:51.949 --> 07:53.560
Do you understand me?

07:53.603 --> 07:56.084
Do you?

07:56.127 --> 07:57.259
- Yes, sir.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.043
- Both of you go home.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.523
We'll finish talking about this
when your mom's done

08:00.567 --> 08:02.569
with her treatment.
- Come on.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.012
- They look
just like each other.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.317
- I think it's the eyebrows.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.884
- [chuckles]

08:13.928 --> 08:15.407
- What about you?

08:15.451 --> 08:17.584
Do you have any photos
of your family?

08:17.627 --> 08:21.805
- Well, actually,
I don't have my phone with me.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.244
- Maybe next time.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.297
Hey, I've been meaning to
ask you about Bruno Mannheim.

08:35.340 --> 08:39.475
Living here your whole life,
you must have met him.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.131
- We both know that Lex is
bleeding South Metropolis dry.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.089
The neighborhood's
falling apart.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.526
People are scared.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.310
Crime's up.
- So are profits.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.659
- But where's that money going?

08:49.703 --> 08:51.313
A little in our pockets, sure,

08:51.356 --> 08:54.882
but the lion's share
is going straight

08:54.925 --> 08:58.538
to Lex and his people
in Metropolis.

09:01.453 --> 09:04.108
- So what,
you want to take Luthor out?

09:04.152 --> 09:05.893
What the hell
is wrong with you?

09:05.936 --> 09:08.373
You're gonna get the devil
sent after all of us.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.376
- I don't want to take Lex out.

09:11.420 --> 09:15.032
I want to make him a deal.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.991
Offer him the rest of the city,

09:17.034 --> 09:19.341
and then in return,

09:19.384 --> 09:22.649
he gives us back our
neighborhood free and clear.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.520
- Not this again.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.176
- We got a infrastructure
just waiting to be modernized.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.220
- By who, you?

09:29.264 --> 09:31.353
- Not just me.

09:31.396 --> 09:35.009
Gillespie, Alistair,
and some of the other 86ers.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.794
They all think
there's opportunity here.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.274
- This ain't a democracy.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.450
- No, it's a business.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.366
And I think
that it would grow tenfold

09:44.409 --> 09:46.847
if you were to make this move.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.896
- Let me think it over.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.332
Peia here,
she'll be in touch.

10:00.382 --> 10:03.646
- Yeah,
I've seen Bruno in passing.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.605
Nothing worth mentioning.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.913
- But your initial treatment

10:09.957 --> 10:12.568
was right after he invested
in Hob's Bay Medical Center.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.963
It seems like you must
have crossed paths then.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.704
- Yeah, it's a big hospital.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.010
Yeah, I don't--
I don't really remember.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.230
- What about at Little Ace's?

10:22.273 --> 10:23.884
I saw his photo
on the wall there.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.146
It looks like he's a regular.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.366
- What are you implying?

10:31.239 --> 10:33.720
- Nothing, just that
you both go there a lot.

10:33.763 --> 10:36.200
- Wait, I'm sorry.
Are you interrogating me?

10:37.941 --> 10:40.248
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.946
- You know what?

10:42.990 --> 10:45.819
This is my last treatment.
I don't feel great.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.560
I'm gonna go sit over there
and close my eyes.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.432
Please don't follow me.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.825
- OK.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.496
- Hey, stranger.
- Oh, hey.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.977
- Natalie told me
you were away.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.806
- Yeah, I just had
to take care of a few things.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.199
I just got back
a couple days ago.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.591
- Yeah.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.245
Cooking dinner
for someone special?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.596
Not that it's any
of my business.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.208
- No, no, no, it's OK.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.124
Nat's actually having
her boyfriend over for lunch.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.821
- Oh, yeah.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.868
I saw them at the
Valentine's Day dance together.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.130
So cute.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.352
Thanks.
- Hey, yeah.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.877
It's nice to see Nat finally
having a crush, you know?

11:43.920 --> 11:47.315
- Hmm, it seemed like
more than that to me.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.491
- What makes you say that?
- Oh, nothing.

11:49.534 --> 11:53.147
They just seemed really smitten
with each other.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.452
- Too bad, 'cause
he lives all the way out

11:54.496 --> 11:56.324
in Metropolis,
you know?

11:56.367 --> 12:00.458
- That's not that far,
especially if he's got a car.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.201
Hold on.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.464
Wait a second.
I know that look.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.423
You better not be
scaring him away.

12:08.466 --> 12:12.122
- No, no, of course not.
You know I'm a cool dad.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.516
- OK, good,
'cause when you're that age

12:14.559 --> 12:18.563
and you're falling in love,
there's no better feeling.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.094
- Everything OK?

12:27.137 --> 12:29.226
- Yeah.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.619
The boys were at the fortress.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.229
- Doing what?

12:32.273 --> 12:33.970
- Let's just
talk about it later.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.798
You should be resting
right now.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.409
- It's not possible.
- You feeling OK?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.063
- No, I feel sick
to my stomach,

12:40.107 --> 12:42.849
not just from the chemo.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.330
Right after you left, I started
asking Peia about Bruno.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.811
And it got ugly.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.987
- I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.860
- She walked away from me
with her chemo cart

12:53.903 --> 12:55.557
to be as far away as possible

12:55.600 --> 12:57.298
because
I am a horrible human being.

12:57.341 --> 13:00.127
- Lois.
- What am I doing?

13:00.170 --> 13:01.955
She's my friend,
and I'm questioning her

13:01.998 --> 13:04.131
like she's a part
of some conspiracy.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.002
- Your gut was telling you
she knew something.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.222
- That's just it.
Ever since this diagnosis,

13:08.265 --> 13:10.659
everything feels off.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.443
I don't trust
my instincts anymore,

13:12.487 --> 13:13.923
especially as a reporter.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.186
- Lois, you've been right
this whole time.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
Bruno is hiding something,
and you're so close

13:18.362 --> 13:20.843
to figuring it out.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.585
I think you might
just need a little help.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.283
- Help from whom?

13:30.026 --> 13:34.857
- I must admit, you showing up
here caught me by surprise.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.251
- Well, I just wanted
to give you a chance

13:37.294 --> 13:39.644
to tell the world your story.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.001
- Where are you taking me?

13:52.048 --> 13:54.834
- I want you to see what I see.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.358
- A dump?

13:57.401 --> 13:59.055
- Opportunity.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.671
These are the old offices

14:06.715 --> 14:08.412
of the factory
where my mother worked in.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.981
Private entry.

14:12.025 --> 14:15.811
Separate elevator
that goes to Rickles Station.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.161
- Metro stopped that line
years ago.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.946
- [chuckles]

14:19.989 --> 14:23.036
- What?
You want to buy this place?

14:23.079 --> 14:25.125
- I already did.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.953
My whole life,

14:26.996 --> 14:29.520
I waited for things
to be better,

14:29.564 --> 14:30.957
waited for change.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.003
I don't want to wait anymore.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.833
It's time for us
to reclaim the Suicide Slums.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.838
- You single-handedly
transformed Hob's Bay.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.796
- All I'll say is

14:44.840 --> 14:47.538
I saw the potential
in things others didn't.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.932
- Well, that seems to be true
of every investment of yours.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.590
- I've been very fortunate.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.636
- Except with your hospital.

14:58.680 --> 15:03.032
According to the records
you provided my wife, um...

15:03.076 --> 15:06.906
yeah, you've invested millions
into cancer research,

15:06.949 --> 15:08.908
but to date,
you haven't made a cent.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.650
- Your point?

15:12.694 --> 15:15.915
- Every investment you've
ever made has been profitable,

15:15.958 --> 15:17.090
except for this one.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.830
- I'm saving my people.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.746
I don't need to profit
from illness.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.053
- Especially cancer.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.968
- Especially cancer.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.015
- This disease
is important to you?

15:29.058 --> 15:32.235
- People in Hob's Bay
are developing cancer

15:32.279 --> 15:34.455
at disproportionate rates.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.196
Did your wife
show you those records?

15:36.239 --> 15:37.501
- She did.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.547
She also told me
about Henry Miller

15:39.590 --> 15:42.593
and James Distefano...
- More accusations.

15:42.637 --> 15:45.118
- Two criminals
who have been experimented on.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.729
Were they also part
of your research?

15:47.772 --> 15:49.949
Because if they were,

15:49.992 --> 15:54.083
it certainly makes me wonder,
Mr. Mannheim,

15:54.127 --> 15:57.391
how far would you go
to cure this disease?

15:59.175 --> 16:01.177
- Your wife is sick.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.789
If her treatment doesn't work,
she'll likely die.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.096
So you tell me, Mr. Kent,

16:07.140 --> 16:10.099
how far would you go
to save her?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.148
- Will you just take a breath?

16:15.191 --> 16:16.279
- Why do you keep
defending them?

16:16.323 --> 16:17.498
- Look, I hate it too,

16:17.541 --> 16:18.499
but they're just trying

16:18.542 --> 16:19.674
not to make us freak out.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.023
- I'm not freaking out.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.854
Look, I know they're
hiding something from us.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.116
- What are you doing?

16:27.160 --> 16:30.119
- Mom keeps notes
on everything.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.730
- Dude,
none of this is helping.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.997
- Really?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.613
- [giggles]

16:45.656 --> 16:47.702
[door unlocks]

16:51.271 --> 16:53.621
You've got a key already?

16:53.664 --> 16:57.059
- No, your dad
loaned it to me for today.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.843
He's not back yet?

17:03.892 --> 17:07.200
Well, I guess I'll just
wait here until the movie then.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.810
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.117
I mean, I thought that it'd be
a small first step for us to--

17:12.161 --> 17:14.119
- Yeah, that's not happening.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.035
- OK, well, you don't
have to leave, Sarah.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.166
- I also don't have to hang out
with my dad's hookup.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.951
- That's not what I am.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.998
- That's what it looked like
this morning.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.913
- You know what?

17:28.917 --> 17:31.180
I know
where you're at right now.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.617
I know how it feels
to see your dad date.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.837
Sarah, it sucks,

17:35.880 --> 17:39.362
but that doesn't give you the
right to go full-on mean girl.

17:39.406 --> 17:42.278
[phone chimes]

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109
Well, your dad is stuck
at the station

17:47.153 --> 17:48.371
for the rest of the day.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.807
Movie's off.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.332
So I don't know.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.073
Take whoever you want.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.078
- Hold up.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.088
I heard it's supposed
to be funny.

18:10.741 --> 18:11.960
[knocks at door]

18:13.222 --> 18:15.094
- Oh, Mr. Johnson.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.097
- Come in.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.098
- Hi.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.275
I'm Matteo.
- Nice to meet you.

18:22.318 --> 18:25.626
That's a firm grip
you got there.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.062
[laughter]

18:27.106 --> 18:28.237
- Matteo.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.328
- Wow, um...

18:34.069 --> 18:35.723
You look stunning.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.334
- Thanks.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.293
I hope you're hungry.

18:43.165 --> 18:47.430
- Oh, man.
This lunch was phenomenal.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.171
- Dad did all the work.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.131
- Oh, you didn't have
to do all this for me, sir.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.307
- It was more for Bug.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.353
- [chuckles] Bug?
- Nat-Bug.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.312
That's what I called her
when she was little.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.966
- And for some reason,
still does.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.014
- Your parents are OK
with you making the trek

19:06.057 --> 19:07.363
back and forth
to Metropolis alone?

19:07.407 --> 19:09.365
- Yeah.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.367
I mean, they trust me.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.760
- It's not that far.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.414
- It's far enough.
- Dad--

19:14.457 --> 19:16.198
- Tell me about this party
where you met Natalie.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.244
- I mean, it was just
a couple of friends hanging.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.897
- With the parents
out of town, right?

19:19.941 --> 19:21.160
- Sir, I'm sorry
if you think that I--

19:21.203 --> 19:22.770
- No, don't apologize.

19:22.813 --> 19:23.945
Just 'cause
my dad's short-circuiting

19:23.988 --> 19:25.120
for whatever reason

19:25.164 --> 19:26.426
doesn't make that your problem.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.689
- Bug--
- Don't call me that.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.299
We're going to the movie.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.040
Thanks for ruining lunch.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.828
- Thank you for the lunch.
It was really delicious.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.630
- What part of don't follow me
do you not understand?

19:56.673 --> 19:59.937
- Peia, I am really sorry.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.899
- And now you're sitting.[scoffs]

20:07.902 --> 20:11.122
- Peia, you have every right
to be upset.

20:11.166 --> 20:15.649
I was digging for a story,
and I crossed a line.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.433
And way too often,
I let my work bleed

20:17.477 --> 20:21.045
into my personal life,
and it never ends well.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.917
It's probably something
I got from my dad.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.527
- Now it's your dad's fault?

20:24.571 --> 20:26.964
- No.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.227
This is all me.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.667
Honestly, I don't have
that many friends.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.367
And I really like you.

20:40.282 --> 20:45.896
And going through all of this
has been...

20:50.814 --> 20:52.860
Unbelievably hard.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.779
And I don't know how I could
have done it without you.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.480
- That's
what cancer friends are for.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.395
- I don't want
to just be cancer friends.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.223
I want to be friend-friends.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.877
- What does that even mean?

21:09.920 --> 21:12.140
I mean, do we need,
like, matching bracelets?

21:12.183 --> 21:13.315
- No, I was thinking necklaces.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.492
- [laughs]

21:16.536 --> 21:19.016
Lois,

21:19.060 --> 21:22.368
you and me, we're--

21:22.411 --> 21:25.458
we're from completely
different worlds.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.938
Not to mention,
we both have cancer.

21:27.982 --> 21:31.159
This isn't really the recipe
for a lifelong friendship.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.769
- I disagree.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.510
And I can be very stubborn
when I want to be.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.033
I don't know if you've noticed.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.993
- A little bit.

21:43.650 --> 21:47.131
- I promise,
no more angles, OK?

21:57.925 --> 22:00.014
- Hey, I'm sorry
to surprises you.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.059
You got a second?

22:02.103 --> 22:04.061
- Did something happen
at lunch?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.281
- [sighs] Yeah.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.022
- Let's pick this up later.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.851
- OK, sure.
- All right.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.635
- [mouths]
Oh, my God.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.465
- Was it the boyfriend?

22:16.509 --> 22:18.424
- No.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.947
- Natalie?

22:22.689 --> 22:25.213
John,
what happened to cool dad?

22:25.256 --> 22:27.041
- He never showed up.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.522
I thought that I could handle
Nat having a boyfriend,

22:29.565 --> 22:33.352
but then I saw the way
he was looking at her

22:33.395 --> 22:35.136
and the way
she was looking at him.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.790
- Aw, that's so sweet.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.531
- I just felt myself
getting really protective.

22:38.574 --> 22:41.142
It was like
this other person took over.

22:41.185 --> 22:45.364
- None of this is easy,
especially for a parent.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.802
- But it's just--

22:48.845 --> 22:53.241
it's like ever since Nat
showed up in Smallville,

22:53.284 --> 22:56.157
all I've wanted for her to do
is teenager things.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.509
Now she is, I'm terrified.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.078
- I don't know
what my dad's problem is,

23:04.121 --> 23:05.688
but that was not OK.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.473
I mean,
could he be more of a clichÃ©?

23:07.516 --> 23:09.039
He was clearly trying
to intimidate you.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.695
- Yeah, well,
mission accomplished.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.045
But you dad's gonna have
to step his game up

23:15.089 --> 23:16.960
if he wants to scare me away.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.398
- Don't tempt him.
- No, I'm serious.

23:19.441 --> 23:23.314
Dude could go, like,
slaughter cabin-level scary,

23:23.358 --> 23:24.751
and I'm just gonna
keep coming back

23:24.794 --> 23:27.101
bringing
my A-game charm offensive.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.146
- What does that even mean?

23:29.190 --> 23:32.498
- It means that I'm gonna
kill you dad with kindness

23:32.541 --> 23:34.587
and possibly gifts

23:34.630 --> 23:37.024
until he realizes
that I am the perfect guy

23:37.067 --> 23:39.548
to date his daughter.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.378
- You are perfect.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.427
- Hey, you two.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.951
Are you gonna buy tickets
or what?

23:51.821 --> 23:54.520
- Oh, sorry.
Hey, sorry.

23:54.563 --> 23:57.131
Hey, sorry, y'all.

23:57.174 --> 24:00.830
I'm just kind of crazy
about this girl right here.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.441
Uh...

24:02.484 --> 24:05.226
two tickets
for "Dumb Einstein."

24:05.269 --> 24:07.184
Uh, thank you.

24:12.712 --> 24:16.193
- So should we
get some candy or--

24:16.237 --> 24:19.109
- Actually,
that won't be necessary.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.850
Wah-pah!
- Oh, my God.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.417
It's like a candy shop in here.
- Yeah.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.984
Well, why pay
movie theater prices

24:24.027 --> 24:26.552
for what you can
just sneak in yourself?

24:26.595 --> 24:28.162
- Ooh, these gummies look good.

24:28.205 --> 24:31.600
- Oh, my God.
No, those aren't for sharing.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.299
- No.
- Sarah--

24:35.343 --> 24:36.910
- Oh, my God.
You're a stoner.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.389
- No, no, no.
This is so inappropriate.

24:38.433 --> 24:39.782
Please don't tell your dad
about this.

24:39.826 --> 24:42.437
- Oh, my God,
my dad's dating a stoner.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.787
Where did you even get those?

24:44.831 --> 24:47.355
- OK, I go to Coachella
every summer,

24:47.398 --> 24:49.488
and bad decisions are made.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.882
And we're never gonna mention
these gummies ever again, OK?

24:55.058 --> 24:56.625
- Wait.
What bands did you see?

24:58.192 --> 24:59.541
- This isn't about me.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.675
- No, it's about
saving your wife.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.068
So why do you keep acting
like I'm the bad guy?

25:05.112 --> 25:07.331
- Because you're playing God,

25:07.375 --> 25:09.551
giving powers to criminals,
putting people in danger.

25:09.595 --> 25:13.555
- Even if that's true,
isn't risking a few lives

25:13.599 --> 25:16.515
for a breakthrough that
could save millions worth it?

25:16.558 --> 25:18.299
- But jeopardizing
even one life is--

25:18.342 --> 25:20.823
- How could you even
look me in the eye

25:20.867 --> 25:22.477
and say you'd do anything
for Lois?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.523
- Because I would.
- Then admit that I'm right!

25:25.741 --> 25:27.700
This is your wife
we're talking about!

25:30.006 --> 25:31.921
- I'm not sure that it is.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.665
This is personal for you.
- Don't go making assumptions.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.841
- No, no, it's why
you bought the hospital,

25:38.885 --> 25:42.584
why you're experimenting
on criminals.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.281
Someone you care about is sick.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.852
- Oh, God.
I feel terrible.

25:49.896 --> 25:54.248
- At least
this is your last round.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.903
You should clear your head
and get out of the city.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.079
- [sighs]
It's been a long time.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.908
- Come out to the farm.
Bring your family.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.563
Clark's not great on the grill,
but he makes a decent burger.

26:04.606 --> 26:08.436
- Um, I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.525
- You took me to Little Ace's.
It's the least I could do,

26:10.569 --> 26:12.832
is show you
some small-town hospitality.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.224
- Lois--

26:14.268 --> 26:15.574
- Plus, we could
make it a celebration.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.792
- Just stop.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.363
I can't do this anymore.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.844
This wasn't supposed to happen.

26:24.887 --> 26:29.849
You and me, we weren't
supposed to become friends.

26:31.154 --> 26:34.114
Everything I told you
was real about me,

26:34.157 --> 26:36.595
about how I was feeling.

26:36.638 --> 26:40.424
I just didn't tell you about...

26:42.339 --> 26:44.211
Him.

26:48.868 --> 26:51.914
My husband's
not who you think he is, Lois.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.438
Everything he's done,

26:54.482 --> 26:56.658
it's all been for me.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.312
- I think that's enough.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.445
- No, it's OK.
I'm glad she knows.

27:01.489 --> 27:04.535
- I don't understand why.

27:06.842 --> 27:10.193
All of these years, why
would you keep this a secret?

27:10.237 --> 27:12.935
- My whole life,
people have judged me,

27:12.979 --> 27:14.981
thinking the worst.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.331
I just...

27:19.376 --> 27:21.291
I just didn't want them
thinking the same way

27:21.335 --> 27:22.641
about Peia.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.257
[machinery beeping]

27:30.300 --> 27:32.694
- Looks like
my treatment's finished.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.394
- Now you know the truth.

27:37.438 --> 27:40.789
Do what you want with it.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.792
[melancholic music]

27:43.836 --> 27:50.843
â™ª â™ª

28:07.250 --> 28:09.862
[indistinct chatter]

28:09.905 --> 28:12.908
- I can't believe
I never figured it out.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.823
- They're not the only family
that's kept a big secret.

28:14.867 --> 28:19.393
- Um, I want to thank
everyone on the staff

28:19.436 --> 28:21.874
for taking such good care
of me.

28:21.917 --> 28:26.748
And I'm truly grateful
for all the surprising moments

28:26.792 --> 28:29.446
I've had with the people here.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.492
But most of all,

28:31.535 --> 28:34.495
I want to thank my husband.

28:34.538 --> 28:39.543
This man has moved heaven
and Earth to try and save me.

28:39.587 --> 28:43.896
Bruno, you have my heart.

28:43.939 --> 28:47.638
Forever and always.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.466
- Forever and always.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.997
- All right.
Let's ring this damn bell.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.303
[laughter]

29:00.347 --> 29:02.958
Say with me, people.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.264
Screw cancer!

29:04.307 --> 29:06.179
all: Screw cancer!

29:06.222 --> 29:07.180
- Screw cancer!

29:07.223 --> 29:10.270
[bell tolling]

29:10.313 --> 29:13.577
[cheers and applause]

29:13.621 --> 29:16.232
- You know, the food
actually came out pretty good.

29:16.276 --> 29:17.886
- I think you ought
to ditch the steel suit

29:17.930 --> 29:20.454
and open a restaurant.
[laughter]

29:20.497 --> 29:23.370
- No, but seriously, though.

29:23.413 --> 29:25.676
Thank you
for talking me off the ledge.

29:25.720 --> 29:30.246
- Oh, well, at the most, you
had your head out the window.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.814
- Yeah. No, I know.

29:37.123 --> 29:40.779
- Whoa.
What did we just talk about?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.958
- OK. No, you're--

29:46.001 --> 29:47.829
You're right.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.875
Cool dad.
- Mm-hmm.

29:51.964 --> 29:53.661
- [clears throat]

29:53.704 --> 29:55.881
- Dad.
- Sir, I was just--

29:55.924 --> 30:00.276
- You and I need to have talk.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.843
- Yes, sir.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.673
- Don't worry.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.544
He can't do anything
to him in public.

30:07.588 --> 30:10.634
- It's like he's trying
to drive Matteo away.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.594
- Your dad's just trying
to figure it out.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.291
This is new for him too.

30:15.335 --> 30:18.381
[excited chatter]

30:21.863 --> 30:24.039
[laughter]

30:25.606 --> 30:28.522
I should go.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.872
- It worked, though.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.660
- Yeah. No, it did.
- Right?

30:36.704 --> 30:41.274
- I just want to say I--
I didn't handle things well.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.232
- No, sir,
I totally understand--

30:43.276 --> 30:44.843
- Stop.

30:44.886 --> 30:47.846
Just let me admit
to being wrong, OK?

30:49.064 --> 30:50.979
[sighs]

30:51.023 --> 30:53.112
You're Nat's first boyfriend,
which means

30:53.155 --> 30:54.765
you're the first boyfriend
I ever had to deal with.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.202
- And I totally get that.
And I just wanted--

30:56.245 --> 30:58.682
- And despite your need

30:58.726 --> 31:01.598
to always give
the right answer,

31:01.642 --> 31:03.035
I can tell you're a good kid.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.822
Nat likes you.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.259
And I trust her.

31:10.303 --> 31:13.480
So now, I'm trusting you
to treat her right.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.224
This is the part
where you talk.

31:18.267 --> 31:22.054
- Well, sir,
I give you my word.

31:22.097 --> 31:24.970
My mom, she raised me to--

31:25.013 --> 31:26.667
she raised me to respect women.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.583
If I were
to ever disrespect Nat,

31:29.626 --> 31:32.542
I'd be more afraid of her
than you.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.240
- Your mom sounds
like a good woman.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.851
- Yeah she's, um--

31:36.895 --> 31:38.853
she's great.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.333
Maybe you can meet her one day.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.075
- Take it one step at a time.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.946
- Yes, sir.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.861
- OK.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.213
- I can't stop
thinking about it.

31:51.257 --> 31:55.914
I mean, Bruno, all of this,
it's been to save Peia.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.263
- Yeah, meanwhile,
I've been chasing

31:57.306 --> 31:58.699
this brutal crime boss
for years,

31:58.742 --> 31:59.787
and now, all I can see is

31:59.830 --> 32:03.182
this loving, doting husband.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.184
- Mom, what is this?

32:05.227 --> 32:06.925
- Whoa, you guys went
through your mom's things?

32:06.968 --> 32:08.535
- You lied to us
about how bad this is.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.189
- Boys--
- These are

32:10.232 --> 32:11.538
end-of-life documents.
Mom, this is your will.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.235
- You wrote goodbye letters,
Mom.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.238
- I know.
And I know how this looks.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.066
And I know
that this is really scary.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.547
But this is all
a normal thing you would do,

32:20.590 --> 32:21.852
just case things go bad.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.159
- Things are already bad.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.988
We hear you getting sick.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.470
We see you losing your hair,
not eating, not drinking, weak,

32:30.513 --> 32:32.820
but you never talk to us
about anything.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.648
And when we try
to get help from your mom

32:34.691 --> 32:37.129
about what is going on,
you get mad at us?

32:37.172 --> 32:39.000
I mean,
what are we supposed to do?

32:39.044 --> 32:41.916
- Jonathan, look, you have to--
- What, Dad? Have hope?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.396
Just believe that somehow,

32:43.439 --> 32:45.702
everything
is gonna work out fine?

32:45.746 --> 32:47.748
You know, maybe that works
for you as a Kryptonian,

32:47.791 --> 32:50.185
but us humans like mom and me,
we can't.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.274
'Cause hope didn't stop your
dad from having a heart attack.

32:52.318 --> 32:54.015
It didn't stop your mom
from having a stroke.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.886
And the last time
that I checked, hope...

32:57.976 --> 32:59.673
Doesn't cure cancer.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.293
- Sorry you had to hear that.

33:11.337 --> 33:14.166
- Jon's just scared.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.298
I think seeing me like this
is a big reminder

33:16.342 --> 33:17.821
that he's not
like you and Jordan.

33:17.865 --> 33:19.736
- Yeah.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.217
Why don't you get some sleep?

33:22.261 --> 33:24.741
And I will go
and talk to the boys.

33:24.785 --> 33:28.441
- I think it would be better if
they heard it from both of us.

33:35.622 --> 33:36.753
- I'm sorry.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.234
- It's OK.

33:39.278 --> 33:40.453
Come here.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.158
You were right.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.986
I'm really sick.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.857
And we've been trying
to hide it from you

33:53.901 --> 33:56.121
and pretend like
everything's fine.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.210
- But you said no more secrets.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.824
- We didn't mean
for it to be a secret.

34:03.867 --> 34:06.870
- We just didn't want
you guys worrying

34:06.914 --> 34:08.568
about something
that may never happen.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.438
- You can't know that for sure.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.571
- Jonathan--

34:11.614 --> 34:13.051
- It's true.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.359
This kind of cancer
is really bad.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.188
- OK, then why not use
technology from the fortress?

34:20.232 --> 34:21.362
- Yeah,
there might be something there

34:21.407 --> 34:22.364
that can help you.

34:22.408 --> 34:23.364
- Because if we use it

34:23.409 --> 34:24.453
to help your mom,

34:24.496 --> 34:25.628
it wouldn't be fair

34:25.672 --> 34:27.108
to keep it from anyone else.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.850
And sharing
Kryptonian technology here,

34:29.893 --> 34:32.157
the risk to the greater good
is just far too high.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.072
- What if the chemo's
not enough?

34:37.248 --> 34:39.077
- Then we're all just
gonna have to accept that.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.342
- I just don't want you to die.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.562
- I don't want to either.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.132
I love you both so much.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.573
More than anything
in the world.

34:57.617 --> 35:00.228
[melancholic music]

35:00.272 --> 35:07.279
â™ª â™ª

35:11.674 --> 35:13.676
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.417
- I saw you in town earlier.

35:15.461 --> 35:18.203
Why did you leave so suddenly?

35:18.246 --> 35:22.598
- Because lately, I've been
doing that thing I always do,

35:22.642 --> 35:24.818
not being honest
about my feelings.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.909
- So you're being full of crap?

35:28.952 --> 35:30.476
- Yeah.

35:30.519 --> 35:32.391
I tried to act like
nothing was wrong.

35:32.434 --> 35:35.742
And then I saw you
and Chrissy having fun,

35:35.785 --> 35:38.266
and it just made me...

35:38.310 --> 35:39.659
sad.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.708
- Mom, it was only a movie.

35:45.752 --> 35:49.147
- No, it's not just that.

35:49.190 --> 35:53.063
I just feel like
ever since the divorce,

35:53.107 --> 35:55.022
everyone's just moved on.

35:58.721 --> 36:02.290
- Maybe it's not
about moving on.

36:02.334 --> 36:06.512
Maybe it's about being present.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.557
I mean...

36:10.820 --> 36:12.692
If there was anything
that you could do--

36:12.735 --> 36:15.303
anything in the world
right now--

36:15.347 --> 36:16.478
what would it be?

36:19.655 --> 36:22.571
- I...

36:22.615 --> 36:26.053
would go shoot off fireworks.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.054
- What?

36:27.097 --> 36:28.664
- Yeah, I would.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.667
I mean, I found
an old box of fireworks

36:31.711 --> 36:33.103
that your dad left behind.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.367
And I'd go and shoot them off

36:35.410 --> 36:38.718
and run away
before the sheriff comes.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.937
- That wasn't the reaction
I was expecting.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.332
- Yeah.

36:44.376 --> 36:45.507
Go to the kitchen.
Get the lighter.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.987
I'll grab the fireworks.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.249
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.468
- Yay!

36:57.302 --> 36:59.521
- Bad time?

36:59.565 --> 37:01.131
- You tell me.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.453
- I'm sorry.

37:18.497 --> 37:21.239
I know you're doing everything
possible to help Mom.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.331
I just wish
there was more we could do.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.943
- Yeah.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.119
Me too.

37:33.860 --> 37:37.994
- Probably helps having
a glass of wine, though.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.169
Wait.
Can you even feel it?

37:39.213 --> 37:41.824
- Nope, not even a little.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.610
But it's something
your mom likes, so...

37:47.177 --> 37:49.745
You know, I was thinking
about what you said earlier

37:49.789 --> 37:51.269
about being human
like your mom.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.271
- I didn't mean anything
by that.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.969
- I know,
but I understand

37:56.012 --> 37:57.536
where it's coming from.

37:57.579 --> 38:01.583
But I want you to remember

38:01.627 --> 38:05.021
that you are just as much
Kryptonian as your brother.

38:05.065 --> 38:07.633
And he's just as human
as you are.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.765
[fireworks crackling]

38:12.681 --> 38:14.857
- It's probably
Wellnitz and Gator.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.555
- No.

38:16.598 --> 38:20.254
No, that's Lana and Sarah.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.255
[cheering]

[hopeful music]

38:23.649 --> 38:30.264
â™ª â™ª

38:44.974 --> 38:48.848
- It's actually kind of nice.

38:48.891 --> 38:52.634
- Yeah, it is.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.432
- There you go.

39:07.475 --> 39:08.650
It's OK.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.045
Let me get you some water.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.090
- It's fine.I just--

39:14.134 --> 39:15.614
I just need
to catch my breath.

39:15.657 --> 39:16.919
- OK.

39:20.575 --> 39:24.797
- I've been thinking a lot
about your proposal, Bruno.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.233
Yeah, I've also been thinking

39:26.276 --> 39:29.497
about how you went
behind my back

39:29.541 --> 39:31.760
talking to them.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.154
They work for me,
not for you.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.199
And I think
you all need a reminder

39:36.243 --> 39:38.288
exactly who's in charge here.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.638
- You don't understand.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.204
- Oh, I understand everything.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.077
Peia.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.998
- [roaring]

39:56.481 --> 39:59.571
[gunfire]

40:08.275 --> 40:12.148
I told you
this was a bad idea.

40:12.192 --> 40:16.152
- No, this is our future.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.980
I know the real you.

40:18.024 --> 40:21.723
I've loved you
since we were kids.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.595
Make a life with me, Peia.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.292
- Peia.

40:25.335 --> 40:27.642
- Make a city.

40:27.686 --> 40:30.210
Forever and always.

40:30.253 --> 40:31.864
- Now.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.779
Peia, do it now!

40:36.216 --> 40:38.087
- [roaring]

40:38.131 --> 40:40.916
- [screaming]

40:52.101 --> 40:53.929
- I love you too, Bruno.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.804
- It's gonna be OK.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.762
I promise.

41:00.806 --> 41:04.113
- Mom?
Mom, are you here?

41:04.157 --> 41:06.420
- We're in the dining room.

41:08.596 --> 41:11.817
- Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.645
Is everything OK?

41:13.688 --> 41:15.734
- It's fine, baby.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.039
How was your date?

41:17.083 --> 41:19.825
- It was amazing.

41:19.868 --> 41:21.870
We watched "Dumb Einstein,"
which was hilarious.

41:21.914 --> 41:24.003
And then after that--
- Slow down, Matteo.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.874
Your mother has had a long day.

41:25.918 --> 41:30.488
- So you and this girl,
you had a nice time then?

41:30.531 --> 41:33.882
- Mom, I'm telling you,
she is the one.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.797
- The one?

41:35.841 --> 41:38.626
Please.
- Dad, you'll see.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.236
I was actually wanting
to invite Natalie over

41:40.280 --> 41:43.283
to Little Ace's.

41:43.326 --> 41:46.286
You two have to meet her.

[tense music]

42:14.619 --> 42:17.535
- Greg, move your head.
