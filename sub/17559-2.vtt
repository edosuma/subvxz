WEBVTT

00:05.046 --> 00:08.508
Hey, hey, hey, do these pants
make my bottom look big?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.178
Bottom?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.597
You're so Amish.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.935
Hey, some guy
from Sports Unlimited called.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.396
He said that your Nolan Ryan
baseball card

00:21.479 --> 00:23.481
won't be ready until 3:00.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.275
Oh, 3:00? You're kidding.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.985
Yep. Made the whole thing up.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.780
Shoot. I really need that card.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.656
It's for a client
I'm trying to sign.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.993
He's a pitcher, and Nolan Ryan
is like his favorite

00:35.076 --> 00:37.162
and now I'm not going
to have time to pick it up.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.502
- Bummer.
- No, please.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.754
Come on.
It's really important to me.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.130
You can pick it up
right after school.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.673
I don't know.
I'm pretty booked.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.967
What do you do
that is so important?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.761
First of all, I have to meet
Henry before school

00:52.844 --> 00:54.846
because he thinks we don't
spend enough time together.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.431
And Gary's going to be there
because he thinks

00:56.514 --> 00:58.057
I spend too much time
with Henry.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.893
And then I have school,
which sucks.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.353
And then after school,
I have a job I have to go to.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.940
Okay, what about the two hour
window between school and work?

01:06.024 --> 01:07.984
Then I have to meet with
Jessica L. and Jessica R.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.986
for coffee because
they think I spend too much time

01:10.069 --> 01:11.404
with Henry and Gary.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.490
And then I need at least
15 minutes of downtime

01:13.573 --> 01:16.451
so I can de-stress
from everyone pulling at me!

01:18.119 --> 01:19.245
Okay, here's the address.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.498
Just swing by there
and pick it up

01:21.581 --> 01:22.999
no later than 3:30, okay?

01:23.082 --> 01:24.459
And drop it off
at the Standard.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.127
Okay, what about studying?

01:26.211 --> 01:28.004
Don't you want me
to get into a good college?

01:28.087 --> 01:30.673
Look, if I get this client,
I'll get a promotion

01:30.757 --> 01:31.841
and that means more money.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.177
Then I can just buy you
into college

01:34.260 --> 01:36.221
and you'll never have
to study again.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.475

[instrumental music]

Okay, would you still be with me
if I gained 600 pounds

02:30.942 --> 02:32.861
and could only bathe
in a kiddie pool?

02:34.612 --> 02:36.489
You're not going to gain
600 pounds.

02:36.573 --> 02:40.034
You've been trying to break 140
since I met you.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.911
Would you still be with me
if I couldn't help it

02:41.995 --> 02:45.039
but I talked at this volume
all the time?

02:48.793 --> 02:50.086
Probably.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.130
But we'd stay inside
a lot more.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.382
Man, listening
to the two of you

02:54.465 --> 02:56.551
talk about stupid things
makes me miss Jill

02:56.634 --> 02:58.094
even more than I already do.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.430
Would you still be with Jill
if her knees were inverted

03:00.513 --> 03:02.682
and she walked
like an ostrich?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.852
Hell, no!

03:05.935 --> 03:07.312
I got to take off.
I'll see you guys later.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.980
- See you.
- Bye.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.192
So why are you asking
all these weird questions?

03:13.276 --> 03:16.112
Well, uh, I didn't want
to worry you

03:16.195 --> 03:19.866
but I have
to have major surgery.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.452
Oh, my God! What is it?

03:22.535 --> 03:25.079
I have to have
my wisdom teeth removed.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.127
That's it?
That's the major surgery?

03:31.210 --> 03:32.962
They're impacted!

03:33.046 --> 03:35.173
They have to put me under,
and I heard that sometimes

03:35.256 --> 03:37.175
people can go into a coma.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.720
You're going to be fine.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.472
That's what everyone says.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.641
No one thinks
they're going into a coma

03:44.724 --> 03:47.769
when they go into a coma.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.771
Tell you what.
How about I go with you?

03:49.854 --> 03:51.522
I promise
that when you wake up

03:51.606 --> 03:54.442
my face will be
the first thing you see.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.736
That will be awesome.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.155
Usually it's my dog's ass.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.747
Uh-oh. There goes Rachel.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.248
Peter's only been here
a week, and he's already

04:09.332 --> 04:11.417
fired like three people
for no reason.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.170
No. That's not true.
Rachel never did any work.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.713
She took three hour lunches,
and she was always

04:15.797 --> 04:17.339
taking credit for things
she didn't do.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.593
Oh, my God!
People notice that stuff?

04:21.844 --> 04:24.055
[laughing]

04:24.138 --> 04:25.264
What bothers me

04:25.348 --> 04:27.308
is he's replacing them
with all his buddies.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.269
It's getting more and more
like a frat house around here.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.979
Now if he'd just fire
the rest of you broads

04:31.062 --> 04:33.481
I'd be the only sweetheart
at the kegger.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.026
- Good morning, everyone.
- Hi.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.279
I'd like introduce you all
to Alan, Mark and Josh.

04:40.363 --> 04:45.076
AKA "The Cheese"
"The Hammer" and "The Dawg."

04:45.159 --> 04:47.161
These guys were all
part of my team in Chicago

04:47.245 --> 04:49.038
and we're very lucky
to have them.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.417
- Okay, any new business?
- Actually, yeah.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.168
Can you believe that
Rangers game last night?

04:54.252 --> 04:55.545
Man, I never thought
I'd get turned on

04:55.628 --> 04:59.882
by a bunch of guys,
but that was a hell of a game!

04:59.966 --> 05:03.052
Whoo, talk to me!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.555
Okay, um,
I have something..

05:05.638 --> 05:08.224
Not quite as homoerotic
as the other thing.

05:08.307 --> 05:11.436
Um, the Mets just signed
this new guy, Mike Logan

05:11.519 --> 05:14.230
and apparently he's not
very happy with his PR firm.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.982
So I've been harassing
his agent

05:16.065 --> 05:17.859
and I have a meeting
with Mike today

05:17.942 --> 05:20.236
4 o' clock at the Standard.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.447
That is exactly the way
I like to do business.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.448
Great work.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.949
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.746
Okay, Alan, why don't you get
Val's notes and contact info?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.873
I'd like you to go to the
Standard and take that meeting.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.583
You got it.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.127
'Great.
Anybody got anything else?'

05:36.210 --> 05:37.712
- Nope, that's it.
- Nothing else.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.589
Alright,
have a nice day.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.260
Did you just see that? He just
gave my client to Alan.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.262
- That is unbelievable.
- Yeah, I know.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.723
It seems like the men
favor each other over us.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.100
How odd.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.436
I'm sorry,
but it's just unacceptable.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.063
I am gonna go in there
and get my client back.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.481
You do that.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.941
You go in there, and you
fight for women everywhere!

05:59.025 --> 06:01.694
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and pretty myself up.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.284
Hi. Can I talk to
you for a second?

06:08.367 --> 06:09.786
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.456
- Hey, Mike Logan, way to go.
- Yeah, about that.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.626
Um, I was wondering
why the client I brought in

06:16.709 --> 06:20.046
you handed over to somebody
named The Cheese Dawg?

06:21.839 --> 06:24.342
Did you do it because, uh,
when we went out to dinner

06:24.425 --> 06:25.968
I called you a pig?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.762
Because I really don't think
I should be punished for that.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.138
Oh, my God, no.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.182
No, I once had a woman
call me a sick bastard

06:31.265 --> 06:33.851
and the next morning I still
let her make me breakfast.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.565
Okay, uh, did you do it
because Alan is a man?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.484
Well, he knows baseball.
He's a guy.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.694
He knows what other guys
are into.

06:43.778 --> 06:48.074
Oh, okay, you don't think I'm
capable of talking about sports

06:48.157 --> 06:51.410
and beer,
and hot girl-on-girl action?

06:52.578 --> 06:54.997
Are you sure
we can't go out again?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.834
Look, I have researched
this guy for the past two weeks.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.794
I know what he likes.
I know what he dislikes.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.337
I know what his old firm
did for him

07:01.420 --> 07:03.089
and better yet, I know
what they didn't do for him

07:03.172 --> 07:05.508
and I really think
that I should be the one

07:05.591 --> 07:07.009
who meets with him.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.511
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.638
Logan's your guy,
you did all the legwork

07:10.721 --> 07:12.557
and we'll meet you there
at 4 o'clock.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.352
- We?
- Listen, Val..

07:16.435 --> 07:18.271
I've had most of my success
working as a team.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.023
That's just part
of my business philosophy.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.943
But it's your meeting, okay?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.571
Okay. That sounds fair.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.782
Hey, you need a nickname.
You have a nickname?

07:29.866 --> 07:32.201
Um, yeah, I had one
in high school.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.745
Great. What was it?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.330
Pickles.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.709
- Pickles.
- Yeah.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.794
I like pickles.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.056
Hey, how's Henry doing?
Is he asleep yet?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.516
Yeah. It took a while.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.185
I asked him to count
backward from ten

07:57.268 --> 08:00.646
and he just kept saying,
"I'm going to die."

08:02.023 --> 08:03.900
That's my man.

[cell phone rings]

08:09.155 --> 08:10.198
Hello?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.074
Hey, I was just wondering

08:12.158 --> 08:14.577
if you picked up
my Nolan Ryan card yet.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.870
Sure did.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.622
- Where are you?
- Two minutes away.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.916
- Oh, you're the best.
- I know. Bye.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.167
Oh, my God!

08:27.381 --> 08:28.257
Hey, Val.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.592
Hey. Where have you been?

08:29.675 --> 08:31.177
Why are you
with Mike Logan?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.054
Why is Mike Logan drunk?

08:34.889 --> 08:36.224
Uh, we took him
to a strip club

08:36.307 --> 08:37.808
and he didn't want to leave.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.811
I thought he might be interested
in a little pre-meeting nudity.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.688
You took him
to a strip club?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.524
Oh, yeah.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.944
And he signed
a three-year contract.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.279
He, uh, missed
most of the dotted line

08:50.363 --> 08:52.907
but I think it will
hold up in court.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.077
You didn't feel the need
to include me in this?

08:56.160 --> 08:58.329
No, but maybe I should have.

08:58.412 --> 08:59.997
You know, if Mike watched
you get a lap dance

09:00.081 --> 09:02.583
we could have gotten
a five-year contract.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.086
Come on, let's go celebrate.
I'll introduce you to him.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.587
You'll introduce me to him?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.548
I should be introducing
him to you.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.883
This is really insulting.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.134
Okay, just calm down.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.719
You wouldn't even know
about Mike Logan

09:13.803 --> 09:14.971
if it hadn't been for me.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.056
I really think I deserve
to be a part of this.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.474
Okay, you know what?

09:18.557 --> 09:21.560
I don't understand you.
We are on the same team.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.605
Team? What team?
I didn't even get to play.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.774
Look, I'm going over there,
and I'm celebrating

09:26.857 --> 09:29.110
about $2 million worth
of new business

09:29.193 --> 09:30.945
and I would really like it
if you came with me

09:31.028 --> 09:33.948
but if you want to just
stay here and pout

09:34.031 --> 09:35.700
that's up to you.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.081
Hey, here's the card. Good luck.
Got to go meet Henry.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.875

I hate those stupid people!

09:44.959 --> 09:46.919
Yeah, stupid people suck.
Got to go meet Henry.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.504
You would think
after three years

09:48.587 --> 09:49.964
of working my tail off
for this company

09:50.047 --> 09:51.090
I'd get some respect.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.508
Uh, okay, yeah,
I have to meet Henry

09:52.591 --> 09:54.176
at the dentist's office.
I promised him I'd be there.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.678
- Got to go.
- Oh, okay. Go, go.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.307
Yeah, I-I, I'm fine. I'm..
Go!

10:00.474 --> 10:03.019
Come here. You okay?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.062
No, seriously, I'm good.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.983
Yeah, I can see that.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.402
Do you think you'd feel better
talking about it in a cab?

10:11.485 --> 10:14.030
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.532
We might have to go outside
to get a cab.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.660
[instrumental music]

10:22.705 --> 10:24.582
(Holly)
'Henry.'

10:25.958 --> 10:28.044
'Henry.'

10:28.127 --> 10:30.004
Holly?

10:30.087 --> 10:32.673
Hey, Henry,
how you feeling, dawg?

10:36.260 --> 10:38.095
What's up, Henry?

10:44.727 --> 10:47.063
[knock on door]

10:47.146 --> 10:48.606
- Hey, can I come in?
- Oh, actually--

10:48.689 --> 10:49.940
Yeah, but this
is really urgent.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.068
Oh, what is it?
Is it Henry? Is he okay?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.236
- Well, he's mad at you.
- I know that.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.238
I've called him like 20 times,
and he hasn't called me back.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.782
That's not the urgent part.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.742
The urgent part is I was
kind of in the neighborhood

10:59.825 --> 11:02.036
and I've got
to use the bathroom.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.829
- What's up, Val?
- Oh, I'll tell you what's up.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.082
The world is not a fair place,
and no matter how hard I work

11:06.165 --> 11:08.250
I will always be considered
a second-class citizen.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.336
Are we gonna have a conversation
about inequality?

11:10.419 --> 11:11.504
Because A, I win

11:11.587 --> 11:13.589
and B I've really got
to use the bathroom.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.884
Typical man.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.260
You know what?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.262
Peter keeps saying
I have to be a team player.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.098
I have always been
a team player.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.558
I just happen
to hate this team.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.186
If you hate work so much,
why don't you just quit?

11:27.269 --> 11:28.604
Start your own company.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.648
You could have it exactly
the way you want it.

11:30.731 --> 11:34.110
Hire all women,
and maybe a sassy gay guy.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.613
Oh, God, I wish
I lived in there.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.659
But it's all full
of funny cartoons and stuff.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.620
Val, if this is about money,
I've got 1300..

11:44.703 --> 11:46.664
No, 1100..

11:48.040 --> 11:52.420
I've got $75 in my
savings account. It's yours.

11:52.503 --> 11:56.465
Okay, Val. Now the way Gary sees
it, you've got three choices.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.092
You could find yourself
another job

11:58.175 --> 11:59.885
and pray it's going to be
a better situation.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.679
Do what Holly said
and start your company.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.347
Or do what 99%
of the world does

12:03.431 --> 12:05.516
and stay where you are,
and learn to suck it up.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.313
I heard you through the door.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.190
Oh, my God, could you hear me?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.696
[instrumental music]

12:30.458 --> 12:31.750
You look good.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.919
There's not a lot
of swelling at all.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.172
Well, it's still very painful.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.008
The doctor has grave concerns.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.844
- About what?
- He won't tell me.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.138
That's how grave they are.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.890
Look, Henry,
I wanted to be there--

12:45.973 --> 12:47.808
Hey, hey, hey.
Water under the bridge, okay?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.895
Okay.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.730
So do you have
those dissolving stitches?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.857
It's just that you said
you would be there.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.110
If I told you I would be there
for you, I would be.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.695
Okay, look,
Val was in an emergency.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.656
I know, I know, I know,
you had a Val emergency

13:02.740 --> 13:04.325
and I am trying
to be understanding

13:04.408 --> 13:07.578
but I just feel like that
if you had wanted to be there

13:07.661 --> 13:08.871
you would have found a way.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.581
Okay, first of all,
I'm sorry.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.250
I wanted to be there,
but there's only one of me.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.793
I try to be a good girlfriend.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.004
I try to be a good sister.
I try to be a good friend!

13:17.087 --> 13:19.882
I am just saying that I really
value this relationship

13:19.965 --> 13:22.092
and sometimes
I'm not so sure if you do.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.428
Oh, my God,
how can you say that?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.680
You know me.
You know who I am.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.390
I think we've been dating
long enough for you to know

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
that if I could have
been there, I would have.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.728
And you know what I'm sorry,
but something came up

13:32.811 --> 13:34.563
and I don't feel that I should
be punished for that.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.232
And to be perfectly honest,
I think you're being

13:36.315 --> 13:38.108
a little bit of a bitch
right now!

13:39.109 --> 13:40.110
I'm the bad guy?

13:40.194 --> 13:41.403
All I did
was have painful surgery

13:41.487 --> 13:42.863
and expect my girlfriend
to be there for me!

13:42.947 --> 13:44.698
Oh, my God, you're not even
listening to me!

13:44.782 --> 13:47.618
- I just said that I--
- I know what you said.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.496
Okay, look,
I can't be here right now.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.664
I've got some things
I need to think about.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.082
No, you stay.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.375
I've some things
I need to think about.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.668
- Good. Think.
- I will.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.253
Me too!

14:03.175 --> 14:07.763
I'm sorry! I can't seem
to control my volume!

14:10.015 --> 14:11.767
[instrumental music]

14:16.063 --> 14:17.940
- Hey. Where have you been?
- Hey.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.401
Hiding. If they can't find me,
they can't fire me.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.695
What's in there?

14:22.778 --> 14:24.238
Oh, I'm loading up
on caramel corn

14:24.321 --> 14:25.906
and Diet Pepsi
from the break room.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.741
Going to see "Nemo."

14:32.788 --> 14:34.206
[knock on door]

14:34.290 --> 14:36.292
Come in.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.669
Hi. Do you have a second?

14:38.752 --> 14:40.963
Yeah, sure.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.049
Uh, look, I'm sorry

14:44.133 --> 14:46.093
about getting so upset
yesterday.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.220
It's just there have been
a lot of changes around here

14:48.304 --> 14:51.473
and it's gonna take
some getting used to for me.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.809
Nah, don't worry about it.
It's already forgotten.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.562
Besides, I kind of liked it
when you got all pouty.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.609
Yeah. How cute are chicks
when they pout?

15:03.819 --> 15:05.988
I'm the one that needs
to make the adjustments

15:06.071 --> 15:08.490
so that is just
what I'm going to do.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.992
I'm gonna suck it up.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.285
Be part of the team,
you know?

15:11.368 --> 15:13.037
Just one of the guys.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.997
Good. I'm glad to hear it,
Pickles.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.167
Uh, Peter, we, we have
a little situation.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.669
I just got a call from
a freaked-out Mike Logan.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.879
What's he freaked out about?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.047
Well, after we left him
at the bar

15:23.130 --> 15:24.256
he took our limo
back to the club

15:24.340 --> 15:26.675
and hooked up
with one of the..

15:27.676 --> 15:28.886
Entertainers?

15:28.969 --> 15:31.013
Yeah, anyway, his wife
found out about it

15:31.096 --> 15:32.890
and kicked him out of the house,
so now I'm thinking

15:32.973 --> 15:34.308
it's going to be kind of tough
to promote him

15:34.391 --> 15:36.268
as baseball's
greatest family man.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.687
Okay, uh,
it's not a problem.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.940
The first thing we got to do
is calm the little lady down.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.108
[scoffs]

15:43.192 --> 15:46.779
- What?
- That is genius.

15:46.862 --> 15:50.282
Yes, how are we gonna
calm this broad down?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.535
Well, I'm thinking
we send her a dozen roses

15:53.619 --> 15:55.245
some candy,
put his name on it.

15:55.329 --> 15:59.083
Yes, yes, say something nice
like, I'm sorry. I love you.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.169
Say something nice
about her rack.

16:02.252 --> 16:05.047
Guys, it's not like
he forgot their anniversary.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.423
He hooked up
with a stripper.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.092
You can't fix that with candy.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.552
Oh, so maybe the team
should take her out

16:10.636 --> 16:12.137
and get her drunk.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.598
Here. Go call the wife.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.350
Tell her that Mike
has arranged for you

16:16.433 --> 16:17.893
to take her out
on the town.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.688
Anywhere she wants to go,
anything she wants to do.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.024
If it's furry, get it.
If it's sparkly, get it.

16:24.108 --> 16:28.028
I want this credit card company
to call me up scared.

16:28.112 --> 16:31.156
So you're talking some
hot girl-on-girl shopping.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.534
Oh, yeah.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.704
Ouch.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.752
[knock on door]

16:49.216 --> 16:51.009
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.600
- So how you feeling?
- Fine.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.894
Uh, my mouth hurts
a little more

17:00.978 --> 17:02.980
since I shoved
my giant foot in it.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.900
Did you do your thinking?

17:06.983 --> 17:08.277
Yeah.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.863
I think I'm kind of an idiot.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.781
Okay.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.828
Look, I know you got a lot
on your plate right now

17:17.911 --> 17:19.663
a-and the last thing
I want to be

17:19.747 --> 17:21.080
is another problem for you.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.000
I want to be
something good for you.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.627
I tried to be there, Henry.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.547
I know. I overreacted.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.632
Maybe a little, yeah.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.469
I think I know why.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.680
It's because when I said I-I
love you you didn't say it back.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.350
- Henry, I told you--
- No, just, just let me finish.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.437
You know, the worst thing
a guy can be in this life

17:43.520 --> 17:45.481
is a chump.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.607
And when I said that

17:46.690 --> 17:49.109
I totally set myself up
to be a chump.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.486
You're not a chump.

17:50.569 --> 17:54.114
Not yet, but it runs
strong in my family.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.992
My dad was a chump.
His dad was a chump.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.369
My cousin's a ch-ump.

18:00.704 --> 18:04.541
Somebody's got to step up
and break the cycle.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.421
Henry, I, I do have
a lot going on right now

18:09.505 --> 18:11.590
and I don't want you
to be a problem either.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.842
But you're gonna become one
if you don't start believing

18:13.926 --> 18:16.512
that I'm committed
to this relationship.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.056
I can't keep making sure
you're okay every second.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.183
You need me to chill out,
don't you?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.143
So, so much.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.271
Well..

18:26.355 --> 18:29.441
...I promise you
that I will chill out

18:29.525 --> 18:31.735
'cause I don't want
to lose you.

18:31.819 --> 18:35.197
And the dentist
gave me these.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.835
Hey. You're back kinda early,
and you look happy.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.878
- That's a good sign.
- Oh, I am happy.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.713
Is, uh, Mrs. Logan happy?

18:51.797 --> 18:52.756
Oh, she's ecstatic.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.174
And are they
back together?

18:54.258 --> 18:56.426
Oh, no, I don't think
that's going to be happening.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.554
See, uh, apparently this isn't
the first time

18:58.637 --> 18:59.930
that Mike cheated on her.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.391
Yeah, there have been
strippers, bartenders

19:02.474 --> 19:05.060
flight attendants, actresses.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.021
One time, the stadium organist.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.731
Ooh. Yeah, I've seen her.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.693
She's older than the stadium.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.070
Ah, good for her.

19:15.153 --> 19:18.907
Anyway, she had like
a 1000 stories and so juicy.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.950
You know what I said?

19:20.033 --> 19:21.410
I said,
"You should write a book."

19:21.493 --> 19:22.619
And you know what she said?

19:22.703 --> 19:25.372
She said, "Great idea."

19:25.455 --> 19:26.957
So she's writing a tell-all?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.877
Mm-hmm, yep. And you know
who she wants to promote it?

19:29.960 --> 19:31.628
Me.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.463
She started asking me
all these questions

19:33.547 --> 19:35.757
and the ideas just started
flowing out of me.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.385
Yeah, it was like we were
feeding off of each other.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.554
I'd say something,
and she'd get excited

19:40.637 --> 19:42.598
then she'd say something,
and I'd get excited.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.183
And I started thinking
you know, if I'm this good

19:45.267 --> 19:48.020
why am I working for you?
I should be working for myself.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.606
'So that is just
what I'm gonna do.'

19:50.689 --> 19:52.190
I quit.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.650
Yes!

19:53.734 --> 19:56.445
- I quit too!
- Huh?

19:56.528 --> 19:59.531
I am tired of being
objectified by men.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.326
You think I like
feeling cheap?

20:02.409 --> 20:03.285
Lauren..

20:03.368 --> 20:06.455
No, Val,
I am having an epiphany.

20:08.040 --> 20:13.337
I come in here every day,
and I feel your eyes on me.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.801
I am not just
a hot piece of meat.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.596
I am a worthy woman.
I have talent.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.598
I have something to offer.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.725
Val and I are going to bury you.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.060
- Right, Val?
- Um--

20:28.143 --> 20:29.645
I'm just gonna go
clean out my office.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.812
Okay.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.980
Ooh.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.191
Well, I could use a big,
strong man to help me.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.776
Come on.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.111
Val, you were awesome.
I'm so proud of you.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.279
I'll be back in two seconds.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.656
I'm gonna go hit up
the supply cabinet

20:40.739 --> 20:44.117
and steal everything
that's not nailed down.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.786
We're gonna be great.

20:47.245 --> 20:50.165
Come on, Val, don't quit.
I need you here.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.335
No, you don't. You can get along
just fine without me.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.004
I don't want to get along
without you.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.673
Are you hitting on me?

20:57.756 --> 20:59.341
No.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.968
Why, was I getting somewhere?

21:02.135 --> 21:03.679
Wait, Val, listen.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.014
I know that things have been
hard for you since I got here

21:06.098 --> 21:08.016
but I really don't
want you to leave.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.103
You're responsible for half
the names on our client list.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.438
Damn, I am good.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.816
Lauren was right.
I will bury you.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.027
- Holly.
- Cover me.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.246
