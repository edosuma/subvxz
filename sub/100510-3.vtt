What are you doing out here?

19:36.050 --> 19:37.927
As the guard approached her,

19:37.969 --> 19:39.262
gun raised,

19:39.304 --> 19:40.597
Ruth stepped in

19:40.638 --> 19:42.265
between them,

19:42.307 --> 19:45.852
allowing the young girl
to escape.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.438
Ruth knew

19:48.479 --> 19:51.900
that she would meet her fate
for this.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.236
So...

19:55.278 --> 19:57.655
she pushed her head

19:57.697 --> 20:00.116
into the gun.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.245
A small act of defiance.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.004
But he didn't shoot her.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.006
Uh,

20:15.048 --> 20:17.425
Ruth never learned why.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.179
But she saved that girl's life.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.266
You were in the camps with her.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.353
Mm. No.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.439
My wife was.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.317
My wife was the girl she saved.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.697
Mm, talk about balls.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.077
We call it chutzpah, but yes.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.120
Oh.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.836
Your grandmother spoke of you
a lot, Jonah.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.215
She said that...

20:57.256 --> 20:59.884
you were a lot like her

20:59.926 --> 21:02.929
but you just didn't know it yet.

21:11.562 --> 21:15.108
So, how did the shiksa
get inside?

21:15.149 --> 21:17.110
No clue. We were watching
the house all night.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.945
Much to my dismay.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.114
What I don't get is,
why go through the trouble

21:21.155 --> 21:22.699
of cleaning up the guy's body

21:22.740 --> 21:24.575
when they could've just called
the cops on us?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.411
It's simple.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.579
The Nazis had a bigger stake

21:28.621 --> 21:32.000
in protecting their secret
than in exposing ours.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.795
The question is,
what secret are they protecting?

21:35.837 --> 21:39.424
The answer is,
we get back to work.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.260
Track down
these Jerry motherfuckers

21:42.301 --> 21:43.529
- and then kill 'em.
- Back to work?

21:43.553 --> 21:45.346
Meyer, this is Bananagrams.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.514
They could be onto us.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.933
I mean, i-if this woman
is proof of anything...

21:48.975 --> 21:51.310
Then we find them
before they find us.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.525
Hey there, America.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.944
Lonny Flash here
alongside Yolanda,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.612
presenting you
with a little knowledge

22:01.654 --> 22:03.281
on this beautiful afternoon.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.075
Who's ready for some knowledge?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.078
Our segment is entitled

22:09.120 --> 22:10.705
How to Find a Nazi,

22:10.747 --> 22:12.957
useful tips
on identifying Hitler's finest

22:12.999 --> 22:14.125
in everyday life.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.418
Ready, Lonny?

22:15.460 --> 22:16.627
Ready, Yolanda.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.671
Number one...
Now, this is an easy one...

22:18.713 --> 22:20.298
If your neighbor waves hello

22:20.339 --> 22:23.217
with his arm
in a perfect 45-degree angle

22:23.259 --> 22:25.511
and invites you over to see
his new walk-in oven

22:25.553 --> 22:26.929
he's been building
in his garage,

22:26.971 --> 22:28.723
you might want
to take a rain check.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.975
That could mean
you've got a Nazi next door.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.935
Yolanda? Number two.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.187
White people.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.355
Good tip, Yolanda.

22:36.397 --> 22:39.108
Three, if your classmate
is drawing a swastika

22:39.150 --> 22:40.818
on a notebook or a friend,

22:40.860 --> 22:44.322
chances are this classmate
may be a fan of Hitler.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.406
Yolanda, four?

22:45.448 --> 22:47.158
White people.

22:48.785 --> 22:52.246
Um, Yolanda,
not all white people are Nazis.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.831
But, um, Lonny,

22:53.873 --> 22:56.834
all Nazis are white people.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.586
Okay, that about sums it up.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.588
Now, it's not always easy.
But who knows?

23:00.630 --> 23:03.800
These helpful tips could help
save your life one day.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.134

25:04.045 --> 25:07.340
regret that I wasn't
the one who...

25:07.381 --> 25:08.925
gutted the fucker. But...

25:08.966 --> 25:10.885

right?

25:12.345 --> 25:13.971
Hmm?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.390
It was different
when it was about her.

got nothing to do with her?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.562
With you?

25:21.604 --> 25:25.149
So that you shouldn't have been
a part of what happened to him.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.817
Is that what you're thinking?

25:26.859 --> 25:30.071
I understand
why you'd think that.

25:30.112 --> 25:33.491
The only thing you know
about the Holocaust

25:33.532 --> 25:37.370
is what you read
in your history books.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.665
But we lived it.

25:40.706 --> 25:43.000
We survived it.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.878
We all knew a Holstedder.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.881
What we're trying to ensure

25:48.923 --> 25:52.260
is that we don't know
a Holstedder again.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.765
I owe my life
to your grandmother.

25:57.807 --> 26:02.019

26:02.061 --> 26:04.438

Well, I owe it to her

revenge for his parents' death.

to get his hands dirty.

to save the world and shit.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.569

32:26.278 --> 32:27.905
it doesn't sound good
to me, either.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.948
But you were right.
In the past year alone,

32:29.990 --> 32:31.950
11 different senior citizens
were killed

32:31.992 --> 32:33.827
under suspicious circumstances,

32:33.869 --> 32:35.913
four of whom are listed
as war refugees.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.290
And one of them
just bit the dust yesterday.

32:38.332 --> 32:39.583
Gene Martin.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.460
Killed in his toy store
in Midtown.

32:41.502 --> 32:43.087
Dicks are working the scene now.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.380
I'm gonna head over there.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.964
I had a feeling you'd say that.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.275
Detective on the case is Parker.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.093
I gave him a heads-up
you might show.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.595
I appreciate that.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.013
Thanks.

32:53.055 --> 32:55.849
So you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

32:55.891 --> 32:58.060
The war refugees?

32:59.061 --> 33:00.312
Come on, Morris.

33:00.354 --> 33:01.939
People like us

33:01.980 --> 33:04.608
- got to stick together.
- "People like us"?

33:06.527 --> 33:08.946
I know what it's like
being an outsider,

33:08.987 --> 33:10.531
trying to fit in with them.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.074
You do fit in with them.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.411
No. I don't.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.875
All right.

33:24.461 --> 33:27.548
I think there's Nazis living
in America,

33:27.589 --> 33:30.592
and someone out there
is taking them out.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.306
Next time we go to Junior's,

33:36.348 --> 33:38.600
I'd think twice about having
that second cheeseburger.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.772
Fuck.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.899
Everything's spinning, man.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.277
- Yeah.
I think I'm drunk.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.904
Yeah, I think you passed drunk
four beers ago. Oh!

33:52.322 --> 33:54.533
Get off me!

33:54.575 --> 33:55.951
Give me a second, man.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.661
Give me a second.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.373
I am definitely not Batman.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.754
More like Fat Man.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.173
- What?
- My fuckin' back is killing me.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.887
You know, Cheeks...

34:14.928 --> 34:17.890
Cheeks definitely ain't Batman.

34:17.931 --> 34:21.226
He could not take
a beating like that.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.395
Like what?

34:23.437 --> 34:26.857
Booty, what-what the... what
the fuck are you talking about?

34:26.899 --> 34:28.901
Well, like when... when Dennis,

34:28.942 --> 34:31.028
he... kept punching you

34:31.069 --> 34:34.031
and punching you
and punching you

34:34.072 --> 34:37.201
- I get it, I get it,
I get it, I get it, I get it.
- and punching... you...

34:37.242 --> 34:39.244
But you kept getting back up.

34:42.498 --> 34:43.999
You know what?

34:44.041 --> 34:46.210
I don't know...

34:46.251 --> 34:50.589
why you keep acting
like Robin...

34:50.631 --> 34:53.842
when you've always been Batman.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.745
Hey. Make way.

35:21.787 --> 35:22.996
Hey.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.706
Uh, go ahead.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.292
You Millie Morris?

35:27.334 --> 35:28.961
Yeah, last time I checked.
You Parker?

35:29.962 --> 35:31.380
You want a hanky?

35:31.421 --> 35:33.632
- It's pretty rank in there.
- No, I'm good.

35:33.674 --> 35:34.758
Suit yourself.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.176
Let's get you some gloves.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.846
Can we get some gloves there?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.987
Davis said you think
this might be related

35:55.028 --> 35:56.989
- to another murder case.
- Two others.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.657
But it's just a theory.

35:58.699 --> 36:00.367
Were they robberies, too?

36:00.409 --> 36:02.911
- No.
- Cash missing from the register,

36:02.953 --> 36:05.372
broken glass, toys cleared out.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.334
Hold on, hold on.
I want to look at him.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.211
Lady, we got to get him
to the morgue.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.963
He got a hot date there
or something?

36:20.304 --> 36:22.723
Stab wound
in the back of his neck.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.726
And his eye, apparently.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.562
But it looks too small
to be with a knife.

36:28.604 --> 36:30.522
Hmm.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.524
I'll bet you
a box of Krispy Kremes

36:32.566 --> 36:34.067
one of those darts went
into his eye.

36:34.109 --> 36:38.030
The question is,
where's that dart now?

36:38.071 --> 36:40.198
You think the killer took it?

36:42.659 --> 36:45.037
Killers, plural.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.997
How do you figure?

36:47.039 --> 36:49.124
Well, take a look at his socket.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.585
You see the way that the blood's
pooled there in the corner?

36:51.627 --> 36:53.938
The only way to do that without
twisting your arm unnaturally

36:53.962 --> 36:55.130
is if you're right-handed.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.341
And then look at his stab wound.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.301
See how it trails off
to the right.

36:59.343 --> 37:02.179
- Left-handed.
- Yeah.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.097
Hmm.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.350
It's a theory.

just some bank records,

45:02.492 --> 45:04.786
- His Diners Club statement.
- Okay.

45:10.458 --> 45:13.586

45:16.172 --> 45:18.550

Mm. Maybe they're

- Thursday.
- Mm.

47:27.762 --> 47:31.641
Ah... Your safta and Meyer

47:31.683 --> 47:34.686

47:34.727 --> 47:37.689
- Yeah.
- Because he was
in love with her, right?

47:39.607 --> 47:41.442
Right?

47:44.320 --> 47:45.905
Did she feel the same way
about him?

47:48.199 --> 47:51.411
Meyer saved her life.

47:51.452 --> 47:55.707
So she was always grateful
for that.

47:55.748 --> 47:58.751
He was also

47:58.793 --> 48:03.548
a painful reminder
of all she'd lost.

48:06.926 --> 48:08.386
What's the matter?

48:08.428 --> 48:09.762
W-What's on your mind, Jonah?

48:18.646 --> 48:20.857
Everyone keeps telling me
that I'm like her,

48:20.898 --> 48:25.153
that I have this fight
inside of me.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.282
But she was driven by a darkness

48:29.324 --> 48:31.784
I've only read about
in comic books.

48:34.954 --> 48:37.290
I-I don't think I can do this.

48:40.543 --> 48:42.170
Not like she could.

48:43.921 --> 48:47.759
You are...
a lot like her.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.552
You are strong.

48:49.594 --> 48:50.803
Smart.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.847
Stubborn.

48:52.889 --> 48:54.432
Kind.

48:54.474 --> 48:56.142
Don't forget smartass.

48:59.062 --> 49:02.982
You're like her in so many ways.

49:03.024 --> 49:05.777
Except the one
that really counts.

49:05.818 --> 49:08.613
Your safta survived the war.

49:08.655 --> 49:13.034
So she didn't have a choice
to be involved in this,

49:13.076 --> 49:16.204
same way me and Murray don't.

49:16.245 --> 49:17.872
But you do, Jonah.

49:22.960 --> 49:26.297
That's what she told me
the night she died.

49:26.339 --> 49:29.133
Exactly.

49:29.175 --> 49:32.178
Ruth chose the darkness

49:32.220 --> 49:36.391
so that you
could have the light.

50:03.126 --> 50:04.877
Hi.

50:04.919 --> 50:06.754
Afternoon, Rabbi.
Sorry to bother you.

50:06.796 --> 50:08.256
Uh, Agent Morris, FBI.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.466
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure.

50:10.508 --> 50:13.386
Great.
Do you recognize...

50:13.428 --> 50:15.012
this woman?

50:15.054 --> 50:17.724
She might be involved
in a case I'm working on.

50:20.560 --> 50:21.978
Yes.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.856
Her name is Ruth Heidelbaum.

50:24.897 --> 50:27.442
She was a member here.

50:27.483 --> 50:31.529
She was murdered in her home
about a week ago.

50:31.571 --> 50:35.366
Ah, such a tragedy.

50:35.408 --> 50:37.744
I'm s... I'm so sorry
for your loss.

50:37.785 --> 50:41.581
Um, can you think of any reason
why somebody

50:41.622 --> 50:43.458
may have wanted to harm Ruth?

50:43.499 --> 50:45.334
To kill her?

50:45.376 --> 50:47.920
Ruth Heidelbaum was the
sweetest lady I'd ever known.

50:47.962 --> 50:50.465
She lived a very quiet life.

50:50.506 --> 50:53.009
Huh. If she wasn't here,

50:53.050 --> 50:55.136
she spent every waking moment
with her grandson.

50:55.178 --> 50:57.513
- Grandson?
- Yeah, Jonah.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.140
They were all each other had.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.311
Ah, it's a lot to shoulder
for a 19-year-old kid.

51:05.104 --> 51:07.273
Mm.

51:14.739 --> 51:17.325
We speed it up, nothing.

51:17.366 --> 51:19.952
We slow it down,
reverse it... the same.

51:19.994 --> 51:22.497
We should have told the kid
the truth about Meyer.

51:23.706 --> 51:26.250
It was not our truth to tell.

51:26.292 --> 51:29.629
If Ruth had wanted him to know,
then God would have f...

51:29.670 --> 51:31.798
God? What has God got
to do with anything?

51:31.839 --> 51:34.175
If there was a God,
then Ruth would still be alive,

51:34.217 --> 51:35.802
Aaron would still be alive.

51:35.843 --> 51:37.386
Should I go on?

51:37.428 --> 51:39.555

51:39.597 --> 51:41.557

as prayer.

this conversation again.
