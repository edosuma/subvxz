00:16.015 --> 00:17.809
<i>Welcome to El Mirage.</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:23.190
<i>You seven raced it out against some
of the fastest cars in America and won.</i>

00:24.066 --> 00:26.068
<i>Today, we have five sleeper cars</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:28.529
<i>racing against a Ferrari
and a Lamborghini</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:32.533
<i>in a quarter-mile,
seven-wide desert race like no other.</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:35.160
I want to congratulate you
for making it to the finals.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.371
So this is what you've worked for.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.706
This is what you had
all those sleepless nights for,

00:39.831 --> 00:42.918
the trials and tribulations
to come out here and race.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.046
<i>The only thing I know
about El Mirage is</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:47.798
<i>it looks like a </i> Mad Max <i>landscape.</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:49.258
<i>It's not a raceway.</i>

00:49.383 --> 00:52.094
It's gonna be a pretty intense race.
It's gonna be awesome.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.722
<i>The biggest thing on my mind
is obviously going seven-wide.</i>

00:55.931 --> 00:58.850
<i>With the last event, you know,
going four-wide, things can happen.</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:03.522
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:04.313 --> 01:06.400
It's unlike anything in racing,

01:06.817 --> 01:10.237
<i>to have supercars
and then sleeper cars on dirt.</i>

01:11.321 --> 01:15.576
I think a supercar is a car for someone
who has more money than sense.

01:16.118 --> 01:19.246
<i>I'm not out here to play.
I'm out here to win this race,</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:20.956
<i>and whoop all their asses.</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:23.500
<i>Being the underdog,
I have nothing to lose.</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:24.918
I'm trying to be on top.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.254
<i>By winning this race,
people will see</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:30.549
that me being in a wheelchair
doesn't really matter.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.177
<i>It's all the winners,
everybody in the winner's circle.</i>

01:34.303 --> 01:36.471
So the last man standing
will have the fastest car.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.374
<i>My name is Corey Caouette.
I'm from Huntington Beach, California.</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:07.461
<i>I live for the competition.
I'm very competitive,</i>

02:07.586 --> 02:09.755
so I felt great
to win the first race.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.590
<i>Fuck yeah, Corey. Get it.</i>

02:15.594 --> 02:17.012
That is sick.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.930
<i>I was proud to win,
and proved that</i>

02:19.056 --> 02:21.391
<i>a garage-built hot rod
could beat a supercar.</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:24.394
- Yeah. Was it close?
- Fuck, yeah.

02:24.478 --> 02:28.857
I never broke a bone in my body
until my accident.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.443
<i>Driving a car,
I thought it was gonna be impossible,</i>

02:32.027 --> 02:34.988
until I built Lunch Money.

02:35.364 --> 02:39.034
<i>Driving it for the first time,
I was definitely proud.</i>

02:39.201 --> 02:41.495
<i>The fact that I built it myself
in my garage.</i>

02:41.703 --> 02:46.541
And as far as the throttle,
it's just as simple as pulling a lever.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.759
<i>Corey definitely doesn't realize</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:58.261
<i>how much of an inspiration
he is to people.</i>

02:58.387 --> 03:00.597
There are so many things
that get in his way.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.393
His disability, all these things,
but it never stops him.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.995
<i>We're just excited
to get out there</i>

03:06.019 --> 03:07.729
<i>and see what we're going up against.</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:11.149
<i>At El Mirage, if I were to win,
I'd just think,</i>

03:11.358 --> 03:13.819
<i>it's just perfect scenario</i>

03:14.361 --> 03:16.196
for the guy with the hot rod
to beat...

03:16.613 --> 03:19.449
any supercar or other sleeper competitor.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.544
<i>My name is Lisa Clark
and I live in Beverly Hills.</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:35.173
I'm driving the 488 Ferrari,
twin turbo V8.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.885
I think they did a really good job
on creating a supercar

03:38.969 --> 03:42.514
<i>that you can drive on the streets,
and yet take it out on a track</i>

03:42.597 --> 03:46.101
<i>and get the full benefits
of really what the car is meant to do.</i>

03:47.394 --> 03:50.772
<i>Being a racer at this stage in life,
and being a female,</i>

03:50.939 --> 03:54.359
<i>you really have to fight a lot harder to
get up there and kind of prove yourself.</i>

03:54.443 --> 03:58.113
All I need now is a red Ferrari
with a female driving it with big boobs.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.032
- Okay, hi.
- Oh, my God.

04:01.533 --> 04:05.704
<i>To win the race at Barstow was
definitely a fun, interesting experience.</i>

04:05.954 --> 04:08.457
<i>I have to say I've never done
anything like that.</i>

04:10.250 --> 04:14.671
<i>But it's always fun to beat the boys.
Hate to say that, but it is.</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:19.926
Yay, I got first place.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.764
The Ferrari, for sure,
is one of the top cars ever made.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.974
<i>So it's gonna be interesting to see</i>

04:26.141 --> 04:28.935
<i>what my car can do on the dirt
in El Mirage.</i>

04:34.191 --> 04:36.753
<i>- What time did we leave?
- I think we left, like, at 10.</i>

04:36.777 --> 04:38.653
- It was, it was like 11:00.
- No.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.900
Yeah, it was like...
'cause we had to stop...

04:40.947 --> 04:43.533
Hold on. I'll tell you right now.
No, I'll tell you all,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.660
'cause my truck
gots all this fancy shit on it.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.830
- Mimo.
- We been on the road for 22 hours.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.666
<i>I'm Stefan Slisz
from Fort Worth, Texas.</i>

04:51.792 --> 04:55.420
<i>My team is my sister Sarah
and my wife Eileen.</i>

04:55.545 --> 04:58.089
We're getting ready to whip some ass.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.929
<i>I beat a $200,000 car
with a $25,000 car.</i>

05:05.096 --> 05:06.473
<i>It's an ego booster.</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:08.058
- Good job.
- Thanks.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.310
<i>I would bet the supercar people
would be arrogant,</i>

05:10.435 --> 05:12.813
really think that they can buy their way
into the world.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.023
<i>Probably most of them don't work
on their own car,</i>

05:15.106 --> 05:16.233
<i>don't know to fix nothing.</i>

05:16.566 --> 05:18.568
Do you know to race
on this type of...

05:18.693 --> 05:19.736
Absolutely not.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.571
The only thing I know about El Mirage

05:21.655 --> 05:24.616
is we better come up with a game plan
when we get out there.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.370
<i>I didn't really do much research.
I just said I'm gonna come out here,</i>

05:28.453 --> 05:32.165
see what it is and just go from there.
The car is my heart and soul.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.544
Hopefully, we'll go out to El Mirage,
go kick some ass and win it.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.512
<i>My name's Pepper Yandell
from Texas. I'm a car photographer.</i>

05:46.096 --> 05:48.890
<i>My clients are the top ten richest people
in the world.</i>

05:49.182 --> 05:50.559
<i>They're princes, they're sheikhs.</i>

05:50.642 --> 05:54.271
<i>I've driven close to 400 million dollars
worth of cars. It's nuts.</i>

05:54.396 --> 05:56.064
As I learned from my first race,

05:56.147 --> 05:58.358
<i>a lot of the people present
didn't expect me to win.</i>

05:58.483 --> 06:00.068
You learned how to drive it
on YouTube?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.987
I've been practicing watching YouTube.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.156
<i>It's understandable.</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:07.868
<i>I don't have
any professional racing experience.</i>

06:07.993 --> 06:10.537
I come from a background
of taking pictures of cars,

06:10.620 --> 06:11.830
not necessarily racing them.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.333
<i>I grew up in kind of a shell.
My parents are amazing.</i>

06:15.417 --> 06:16.835
<i>They took really good care of me.</i>

06:16.960 --> 06:20.213
<i>But unfortunately, I found myself
in trouble with the law multiple times.</i>

06:20.463 --> 06:22.215
<i>And when I started shooting cars,</i>

06:22.299 --> 06:24.593
<i>that allowed me
to get out of that lifestyle,</i>

06:24.676 --> 06:27.304
<i>surround yourself with positive,
hopeful people.</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:30.098
<i>That's what keeps driving me,
because my parents are now proud.</i>

06:30.765 --> 06:34.144
<i>So I want to prove to them
that I'm capable of winning this race.</i>

06:34.352 --> 06:37.606
I think my best advantage
is gonna come from the finely-tuned

06:37.731 --> 06:41.234
Italian launch control
on the Huracán and all-wheel drive.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.362
<i>Hopefully those two factors, you know,
I can bring home a win.</i>

06:53.038 --> 06:55.624
<i>My name's Ryan Vuich.
I'm from Jackson, Michigan,</i>

06:55.707 --> 06:57.292
<i>representing Detroit, Michigan.</i>

06:57.375 --> 07:00.879
<i>I have a '94 GMC Sonoma.
I built it about 10 years ago</i>

07:00.962 --> 07:04.049
<i>and it has a 3.8-liter
Grand National motor in it, twin turbo.</i>

07:04.549 --> 07:07.135
<i>The motor makes
about 14,1500 horsepower,</i>

07:07.260 --> 07:09.638
and it's all pretty much custom stuff,
all done...

07:09.721 --> 07:13.433
not something you can buy off the shelf.
The last race kind of got hot.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.852
The rules were one fucking burnout!

07:16.019 --> 07:19.606
We all agreed to a set of rules,
and them rules got broken.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.192
So, Dave, unfortunately,
you had two burnouts,

07:22.442 --> 07:25.320
so you're disqualified.
Nick, same thing.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.530
What we think the fairest thing to do

07:27.614 --> 07:31.076
is have a runoff between Ryan and Cedric.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.666
<i>You know, I won. I felt great.
All my friends were telling me,</i>

07:37.749 --> 07:40.189
<i>"We're supporting you."
They thought my truck was pretty fast.</i>

07:40.251 --> 07:42.128
<i>I'm glad I won.
Glad I'm representing Detroit.</i>

07:42.212 --> 07:45.006
<i>Drag racing seven wide, I think,
is gonna be a really cool experience.</i>

07:45.090 --> 07:49.469
But a lot of people, they doubt me,
and don't want to see me succeed.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.596
So I have everything to lose.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.980
My name is Ron Schneider.
I live in Nuevo, California

08:00.063 --> 08:03.650
<i>and my car
is a 2005 Dodge Ram 3500 diesel.</i>

08:06.486 --> 08:08.947
Been racing in one form or another
pretty much my whole life.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.534
<i>You know, from remote control cars,
BMX racing,</i>

08:12.951 --> 08:16.246
you know, buggies, high school drags.
It literally is like a drug.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.708
It just hooks you and keeps you,
and you just, you never stop.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.877
<i>The last race was an awesome event.</i>

08:25.463 --> 08:27.340
<i>The light went green and we took off.</i>

08:29.426 --> 08:32.636
<i>And when I came up on the stripe,
couldn't believe that we took the win,</i>

08:32.846 --> 08:34.472
<i>especially against the supercar.</i>

08:35.015 --> 08:37.933
It was a big win. It meant a lot to me
and the rest of my crew.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.477
<i>Feeling like a million bucks.</i>

08:39.561 --> 08:43.148
<i>Brought my life back around full circle
through the struggles that I've had,</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:44.691
<i>divorce four or five years ago,</i>

08:44.774 --> 08:46.776
back where I'm supposed to be,
and that's racing.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.361
You did good, bro. You did good.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.655
To have the support
from everybody behind me...

08:52.741 --> 08:54.534
it's awesome. Love it!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.703
It was definitely an emotional day.

08:58.121 --> 09:01.291
<i>Biggest thing going through my mind
heading out to the next event is just,</i>

09:01.374 --> 09:03.168
<i>you know, what are
the conditions of the day?</i>

09:03.293 --> 09:05.086
<i>And see how the tires
are gonna hook up,</i>

09:05.170 --> 09:07.047
<i>and I know she's going straight
no matter what.</i>

09:08.298 --> 09:11.092
I couldn't have asked
for a better support team than my family,

09:11.259 --> 09:13.720
<i>and a better group of guys
to help me out.</i>

09:14.179 --> 09:16.973
<i>When push comes to shove,
we'll wrench 'till, you know,</i>

09:17.057 --> 09:18.457
<i>we can't wrench anymore
to make sure</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:20.977
that that truck crosses the stripe
in first place.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.157
<i>My car is a '92 Plymouth Colt,</i>

09:34.324 --> 09:35.992
that I swapped with a 4G 6.3 engine

09:36.117 --> 09:38.328
out of a '91 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.082
It's loud, obnoxious, kind of like me.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.294
<i>It is a bad-ass machine
that I created from a pile of junk.</i>

09:46.377 --> 09:48.463
<i>What makes it fast
is that I built the car.</i>

09:48.546 --> 09:50.173
<i>I'm Turbo Tony.
You got to remember that.</i>

09:53.593 --> 09:55.512
<i>My whole life,
I've been the underdog.</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:58.640
<i>I think that's where the whole sleeper
thing really attracts to me the most.</i>

09:58.932 --> 10:01.851
Growing up to be who I am today
really didn't come from where I was.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.480
<i>I mean, I learned how I didn't want to be.
I didn't have any money.</i>

10:05.772 --> 10:08.024
<i>My father, he was an alcoholic.
He likes to drink.</i>

10:08.399 --> 10:10.777
<i>That's what he liked to do.
He just wasn't a father.</i>

10:10.944 --> 10:13.238
I didn't have that direction
when I was growing up.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.240
<i>It made me not want to be like him.</i>

10:15.406 --> 10:18.368
So if you were to know me then
versus knowing me now,

10:18.535 --> 10:21.371
you'd be like, you'd be like,
"Wow, he actually made it,

10:21.454 --> 10:22.705
he did all right."

10:23.123 --> 10:26.751
<i>I got here just from lots of hard work.
It felt really good to win the first race.</i>

10:34.300 --> 10:35.510
- You did it!
- I know.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.598
<i>Especially with
my '92 Plymouth Colt. It blows my mind.</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.892
It was designed
to get you from A to B,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.270
get you about 40 miles a gallon
with its 1.5-liter engine.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.646
<i>They're throwaway cars.</i>

10:46.896 --> 10:50.316
<i>It's such a shitbox, but now,
instead of three other guys,</i>

10:50.441 --> 10:53.361
<i>I've got to beat six other guys.
And they all want to win, too.</i>

10:53.695 --> 10:55.697
<i>I'm not the only one out here
that wants to win.</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:59.284
I love my Colt so much, 'cause it's like
family to me at this point.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.328
I've gone through some really bad times
in my life with this car,

11:02.412 --> 11:04.080
<i>and the car helped me get through that.</i>

11:04.205 --> 11:07.959
I'm confident saying my Colt,
she'll do... she'll do just fine,

11:08.042 --> 11:09.482
against even the most expensive car.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.011
<i>So I did a little research</i>

11:18.136 --> 11:20.471
<i>on the Internet and found
this guy, David Gomer,</i>

11:20.555 --> 11:24.350
who's a record holder,
land speed racer, El Mirage.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.312
<i>And he's gonna give me some tips
for the final race.</i>

11:27.478 --> 11:29.038
- How are you?
- Good, nice to meet you.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.125
- Yeah. How are you, guys?
- What's up, man? I'm Rob.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.775
- Hey, Rob, nice to meet you.
- You too.

11:32.859 --> 11:33.859
Dave Gomer.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.196
We hold the land speed record out there
for El Mirage,

11:36.446 --> 11:38.823
<i>and that's at 201.7.</i>

11:38.907 --> 11:41.075
<i>We just set that last year in October.</i>

11:41.409 --> 11:43.161
What I know about the history of El Mirage

11:43.244 --> 11:45.580
is that our grandfathers
pretty much started out there,

11:45.663 --> 11:48.374
<i>and they were taking their Model As</i>

11:48.499 --> 11:51.336
<i>that they put a bigger engine in
and souped up.</i>

11:51.878 --> 11:53.671
They basically just started hot rodding.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.258
<i>This is no smooth
concrete strip he's traveling.</i>

11:57.884 --> 12:00.220
<i>The dry lake bed
is full of ruts and bumps.</i>

12:00.511 --> 12:04.015
When those guys go out there, they're
going 200 miles an hour at El Mirage.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.934
<i>Different from what we are doing,</i>

12:06.017 --> 12:08.937
<i>but going out there
definitely is some serious history,</i>

12:09.020 --> 12:12.857
and I think it'd be awesome
to bring my 1927 Dodge out there

12:12.941 --> 12:15.485
and clean up the competition, you know?

12:15.568 --> 12:19.447
<i>It's just like throwing it back
to when it originally started.</i>

12:19.864 --> 12:22.367
We have the nitrous on a progressor.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.703
Do you? I mean, out there,
I've seen guys hit that nitrous,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.957
<i>and they've spun these things out.
They've ended up on their lids.</i>

12:29.207 --> 12:31.042
<i>I would say don't even run the nitrous.</i>

12:32.710 --> 12:34.963
<i>He thinks that
I shouldn't use the nitrous,</i>

12:35.046 --> 12:36.881
<i>but I'm going to have
to use the nitrous.</i>

12:37.131 --> 12:40.468
I don't make enough power
on the motor to get it done.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.595
<i>What did you do now
to get ready?</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:45.556
We got the nitrous controller
working great.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.392
- Which is a progressive one.
- Yeah.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.227
We want to progress it really easy.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.814
Safety is not the first on his mind.
Safety is first on my mind,

12:52.897 --> 12:55.275
and we kind of butt heads
when it comes to that.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.819
I don't know what I would do
if anything happened to him.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.864
She hates when I add more nitrous to it,

13:01.990 --> 13:04.200
<i>and safety's very important.</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:08.496
So I try to do safety,
and then a little more speed.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.040
<i>And then safety and a little more speed
to keep her happy.</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:13.084
She thinks I'm nuts and I'm gonna die.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.962
<i>Wow, look at this.</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:18.589
<i>Dude, if this is what we're racing on,
we're in trouble.</i>

13:18.923 --> 13:21.175
The desert's gonna be really tricky
for everyone.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.342
Do you know how to race
on this type of...

13:23.428 --> 13:25.430
Absolutely not. I have no idea.

13:28.224 --> 13:32.103
Sarah, did you research dirt racing?
'Cause you had one job.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.229
No, I didn't.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.481
We just need to find
somewhere that's smooth,

13:35.565 --> 13:37.608
not a whole bunch of dirt,
like not sandy.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.446
Look. Right here. Rabbit Lake.
It's 25 minutes from here.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.116
Sarah, if the car don't hook,
we're gonna have to put you in the trunk,

13:45.199 --> 13:47.160
get a little extra weight
back there for traction.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.260
I hate you.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.748
<i>Look at all the dirt's
that picking up...</i>

13:52.206 --> 13:55.001
<i>I've never made any test passes
on a dry lake bed,</i>

13:55.084 --> 13:57.420
so hopefully it'll give us
some good data,

13:57.503 --> 14:00.048
see what we need to do
to prepare for El Mirage.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.176
Here, we should probably
put the air filter on now.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.553
<i>My Thunderbird is
definitely a tribute car</i>

14:05.762 --> 14:08.264
<i>for my friend Blake, after he died.</i>

14:08.431 --> 14:12.393
We built it in remembrance of
Blake, 'cause he had a Thunderbird.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.314
<i>It was good for my sister
to get a guy that truly cared about her.</i>

14:16.397 --> 14:19.108
<i>Blake was a genuine, good person.</i>

14:19.650 --> 14:23.988
So it made me happy
that, you know, they got together.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.075
<i>After Blake died,
Stefan watched over me.</i>

14:27.992 --> 14:30.244
<i>It's helped me a lot.
Stefan's a great guy,</i>

14:30.620 --> 14:33.164
and I'm very thankful
that he's my brother.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.971
- How was it?
- It was slow.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.140
Oh, boy.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.936
I don't know.
It was... it was spinning a little bit.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.397
<i>I mean, it's not that easy.</i>

14:57.772 --> 15:00.441
The sleeper cars and the supercars
are gonna have a hard time.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.617
<i>The feeling of racing a Ferrari,</i>

15:09.700 --> 15:12.328
<i>the engineering of it
when you press on the throttle,</i>

15:12.537 --> 15:14.205
<i>is an invigorating feeling.</i>

15:14.288 --> 15:17.625
<i>Because you just feel
completely surrounded</i>

15:17.708 --> 15:21.421
by this amazing sound and thrill of power,

15:21.671 --> 15:23.423
<i>is unlike any other.</i>

15:23.506 --> 15:28.177
<i>Especially when you do full throttle
on that car, it's a blast.</i>

15:31.055 --> 15:33.057
The last thing I thought
I would ever be doing,

15:33.141 --> 15:37.353
a drag race in dirt, in El Mirage.
I mean, that's... funny.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.398
I've only ever tried that car on a track.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.024
So what do you think, you excited?

15:42.108 --> 15:44.110
Yeah, I'm excited...
and a little nervous,

15:44.193 --> 15:48.322
just wondering how everyone's
gonna handle the craziness of it all.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.616
<i>I don't know anything about El Mirage,</i>

15:50.908 --> 15:54.370
so I'm trying to do some research
with my coach.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.623
Dry lakebed in northwestern Victor Valley

15:57.957 --> 16:00.001
of the central Mojave Desert.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.962
On the surface, there's gonna be dust,
real fine dust,

16:03.087 --> 16:05.965
and that's where the difficulty, I think,
is gonna be, in the launch.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.385
Yeah, because I feel like
those other cars, like the sleepers,

16:09.510 --> 16:12.180
they're gonna really get a good start.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.974
But I don't know about them
furthering it down the road

16:15.057 --> 16:17.059
where I think
I'm gonna have that advantage.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.645
We won't know, you know,
what it's like until we get there.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.609
But the great part about that is,
same thing with the six other people...

16:22.773 --> 16:24.317
Yeah, that's what makes it fun.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.819
So we've got to remember,
like, as nervous as you get...

16:26.903 --> 16:28.783
- Right.
- There's always somebody more nervous.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.615
What did I get myself into here?

16:33.284 --> 16:35.161
- There she is.
- There she is.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.954
The yellow beast.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.875
You've got the Michelin Pilot Supersports.
I mean, sticky tires, you know.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.295
So it's gonna get us ideal traction,
and it still is a street-based tire,

16:44.378 --> 16:46.923
<i>so it's meant to evacuate water
and other debris.</i>

16:47.006 --> 16:48.925
- Right.
- And we've got 660 horsepower.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.719
Once it gets moving, man,
I mean, that's where reliability...

16:51.802 --> 16:54.442
You know, the engineering
built into the car is gonna be fantastic.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.269
Yeah, it's pretty funny that Turbo Tony,

17:00.353 --> 17:04.898
the street racing legend from Connecticut
is spreading out to the west coast now.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.401
<i>We did drive 3000 miles
to fuck up everyone.</i>

17:07.568 --> 17:10.613
It is how it's gonna be.
We're gonna take out everyone.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.490
That's it.
There's no other way to do it.

17:14.282 --> 17:17.328
<i>Never thought I'd be racing
in a dry lakebed in California.</i>

17:17.662 --> 17:21.249
<i>I found this place locally called
Rabbit Lake. It's another dry lakebed.</i>

17:21.374 --> 17:23.917
<i>It's not the same as El Mirage,
but it's similar.</i>

17:24.085 --> 17:27.672
<i>So I'm gonna go over there and test it
so I have some type of experience on it,</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:30.007
<i>so I know how much power to take in
and out of the car.</i>

17:31.425 --> 17:34.595
<i>What I'm doing in a front-wheel
drive car, nobody has done in my car.</i>

17:34.679 --> 17:38.182
<i>Nobody. Like, the people that go fast
in these cars make them all-wheel drive.</i>

17:38.266 --> 17:41.310
<i>So you use a softer tire.
So I bought a different tire this time,</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:43.938
<i>and we're gonna try it out
and give it absolutely</i>

17:44.021 --> 17:46.023
<i>the best I can possibly do
with what I'm given.</i>

17:52.697 --> 17:55.050
- He didn't ev...
- Definitely babied it out of the hole too.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.243
I mean, he's gone,
but you didn't hear him get into it.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.911
Still can't even see him.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.539
<i>With the dirt,
like, if I'm behind everybody,</i>

18:01.622 --> 18:03.624
<i>which I notoriously am behind everybody,</i>

18:04.041 --> 18:06.085
I have to drive through the dirt

18:06.294 --> 18:09.046
as well as no visibility
to get around these people.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.717
<i>So I'm kind of hoping
that I get out ahead so I can see.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:14.468
<i>I wanna be able to see what I'm doing.</i>

18:14.677 --> 18:17.138
That's it. I've seen all I need to see.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.725
Being the underdog,
I have nothing to lose.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.524
- Hello.
- <i>Hi.</i>

18:28.733 --> 18:30.568
So, Mom, what do you think
about the race?

18:30.818 --> 18:33.821
<i>Of course, I'm always a little bit worried
every time you do anything.</i>

18:34.030 --> 18:35.823
I hope I make you proud
by winning this race.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.994
<i>Well, I hope you do too.
But I'm pretty sure you will.</i>

18:40.244 --> 18:42.204
<i>You will let me know, won't you?</i>

18:42.371 --> 18:45.333
- I'll call you right after the race.
<i>- Oh, that'd be awesome.</i>

18:45.416 --> 18:47.585
All right. Well, I love you. Bye.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.963
<i>I just picked up
the car this morning.</i>

18:51.797 --> 18:53.966
<i>My experience is none driving on dirt.</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:56.177
<i>There's a lot of unknown factors involved.</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:58.971
But, you know, I've been thinking
about this race for a while.

18:59.055 --> 19:03.100
And I'm trying to figure out what can I do
to give me any sort of advantage?

19:03.184 --> 19:06.395
<i>I'm going to pull out every little bit
of weight that I can from the car.</i>

19:06.479 --> 19:08.939
<i>Personally, I've been eating
super healthy for the past month,</i>

19:09.065 --> 19:10.483
<i>to try to cut off a few pounds.</i>

19:10.608 --> 19:12.401
<i>I'm doing everything I can
to win this race.</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:16.447
I'm just gonna use all the wisdom

19:16.614 --> 19:18.949
and experience I've gained
driving these cars in the past,

19:19.033 --> 19:21.118
and hopefully
it can do me good out there.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.459
I will say I'm surprised
you're actually doing this after that.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.170
Yeah, everybody told me I should just,

19:31.629 --> 19:34.674
probably just lay at home
and rest my leg.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.386
So I go to light a fire, I'm on the phone,
I'm in the middle of doing 20 things.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.555
<i>And I'm like, hey, yeah,
I'm gonna have to let you go.</i>

19:41.639 --> 19:43.182
<i>Well, the gas can caught on fire.</i>

19:43.265 --> 19:45.017
<i>So I walk over there
and I kick the gas can</i>

19:45.434 --> 19:48.854
into the fire pit, thinking, "Hey,
let's get it out of the grass."

19:49.063 --> 19:52.191
Well, when I kicked it,
it obviously squirted on my foot.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.193
<i>So I jumped in the pond.</i>

19:54.276 --> 19:56.737
<i>My sock and my shoe
was pretty much melted to my foot.</i>

19:56.821 --> 19:58.322
<i>Ripped it off. I'm looking at it.</i>

19:58.531 --> 20:01.659
<i>I'm like, yeah, it don't look that bad,
you know, running cold water on it.</i>

20:01.909 --> 20:03.577
But soon as I took
the water off of it,

20:03.661 --> 20:05.788
man, it started to blister up
and got pretty bad.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.206
<i>It was stupid, wasn't thinking.</i>

20:07.289 --> 20:10.501
<i>But you would have to cut my foot off
so I wouldn't be able to drive.</i>

20:10.876 --> 20:12.753
I've got a race tomorrow at El Mirage,

20:12.837 --> 20:16.298
<i>and I got second and third degree burns
on my leg. It's my driving foot.</i>

20:16.507 --> 20:18.735
You're looking at three
months' recovery on that.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.553
Yeah. I'm good. I think it's all right.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.097
<i>I feel like most people
would've quit at this point.</i>

20:23.264 --> 20:25.558
But Detroit doesn't quit.
We hustle harder.

20:30.604 --> 20:34.942
All right, let's test-fit this thing
and let's see if this will be our key

20:35.025 --> 20:37.737
to keeping everything clean
going down the dirt.

20:37.945 --> 20:38.945
Sure hope so.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.323
I think the El Mirage
is gonna be a lot of fun,

20:41.407 --> 20:43.200
especially for my situation and my truck.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.828
<i>I mean, what better vehicle...</i>

20:46.454 --> 20:50.166
<i>to go to an event
that's a drag race on dirt than a truck?</i>

20:50.291 --> 20:53.878
I mean, cars don't belong on the dirt.
That's why cars are on the street.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.380
All right. There we go.
That's what I'm talking about.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.048
Should keep everything clean.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.259
That'll definitely
keep the dust out of it.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.553
Tire choice is always a huge deal.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.514
So what we're gonna do,
instead of running our slicks,

21:05.598 --> 21:08.476
we're gonna switch over
to all-terrains on this particular one.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.313
<i>Obviously, out on the dirt,
you need that traction.</i>

21:13.230 --> 21:15.149
<i>I've ordered them.
They're not in yet.</i>

21:15.983 --> 21:18.527
<i>They're supposed to be in
right before we have to leave.</i>

21:21.489 --> 21:24.992
So I know we don't have the tires yet,
but it's gonna be the same idea.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.286
So let's launch out,
and let's just kind of see

21:27.369 --> 21:28.913
what the all-terrains do in the dirt.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.049
Yeah, there we go.
That's what I'm talking about.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.132
The all-terrains are gonna be
perfect for the dirt.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.345
We're gonna take all of our tires
with us just in case,

21:44.428 --> 21:46.348
conditions are different
than what I'm expecting.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.016
I'm thinking we leave on
a little bit lower boost than normal,

21:49.141 --> 21:52.102
to make sure we don't spin too much
and we can get out of the hole quick.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.731
I think with the all-terrains, though,
she may kick just a touch sideways,

21:55.940 --> 21:58.108
you know, at the beginning.
But I think after that,

21:58.192 --> 22:00.592
it's gonna start shooting straight
just like she always does.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.906
Being 18 foot long, it's a little hard
to keep it sideways.

22:03.989 --> 22:04.989
Exactly.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.830
<i>It's a lot of pressure on me to make
sure that going into this next event,</i>

22:10.913 --> 22:12.957
<i>that I put that truck
in the winner's circle.</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:16.502
<i>So my plan is,
is just to get off the line first,</i>

22:16.752 --> 22:18.838
<i>leave everybody behind me,
and just make sure</i>

22:18.921 --> 22:20.923
<i>that I get to that stripe
before anyone else.</i>

22:24.635 --> 22:26.011
<i>I'm ready to race,</i>

22:26.220 --> 22:29.765
<i>but if something does show up
that's lighter</i>

22:29.890 --> 22:32.893
and has a little bit more horsepower,
I'll be worried about them.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.938
But as of right now, I'm pretty confident.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.523
<i>The last thing I thought,</i>

22:37.648 --> 22:41.193
<i>is I would ever be doing
a seven-wide drag race with supercars</i>

22:41.277 --> 22:44.113
<i>and then sleeper cars in dirt,
in El Mirage.</i>

22:44.196 --> 22:46.907
<i>It's unlike anything in racing,</i>

22:46.991 --> 22:50.452
<i>so it's gonna be
really pretty cool to watch.</i>

22:50.786 --> 22:54.206
I'm kind of worried about
some inexperienced driver

22:54.456 --> 22:56.166
<i>losing control on this surface.</i>

22:56.542 --> 22:59.628
But I'm probably the most
experienced driver out of all of them.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.172
<i>I feel like I should be able
to out-drive them.</i>

23:02.506 --> 23:05.593
There's rarely an occasion
that you get to go

23:05.676 --> 23:07.887
3000 miles away from home
to race your car,

23:08.053 --> 23:11.599
<i>to try to be the fastest car.
I hate losing.</i>

23:11.682 --> 23:13.642
<i>Anybody that knows me,
they will attest to it,</i>

23:13.726 --> 23:16.562
that I'm a very competitive person
in anything I do, so.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.523
<i>I feel like the pressure
is extremely on me now</i>

23:19.607 --> 23:21.567
to take home the victory.
I'm in a supercar,

23:21.650 --> 23:22.860
I can't let a sleeper car win.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.195
So how many supercars
you think there is?

23:25.279 --> 23:27.823
- I think it's all gonna be supercars.
- No.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.700
I think there's at least three,
four of them.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.911
- No.
- I believe, I think so.

23:32.453 --> 23:35.915
- I hope there's some sweet shit, though.
- I hope there's some fast shit.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.168
- That's what I'm hoping.
- What? Whose side are you on here?

23:39.251 --> 23:42.087
- We're faster, so it don't matter!
- You just said fast shit!

23:50.429 --> 23:53.057
<i>In order to be nervous
requires some bit of knowledge.</i>

23:53.140 --> 23:55.434
<i>I have almost none
when it comes to drag racing,</i>

23:55.517 --> 23:57.686
<i>and literally none
when it comes to racing on dirt.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:02.691
<i>None of us really know what to expect,
so I guess I'm the first to find out.</i>

24:05.361 --> 24:09.406
<i>I'm definitely getting excited.
Excited to see what shows up,</i>

24:09.490 --> 24:12.409
<i>and figure out
what it's gonna take to beat them.</i>

24:19.333 --> 24:20.810
- Hey, Corey. How's it going?
- How's it going?

24:20.834 --> 24:22.920
Good to see you again.
Pepper, this is Corey.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.588
- Corey, Pepper.
- Nice to meet you.

24:24.672 --> 24:25.965
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.335
Coming from the distance,
it looks a lot like <i>Mad Max</i>.

24:28.509 --> 24:29.760
Yeah, pretty much.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.596
- That's awesome.
- I'm pretty sure it belongs out here, so.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.515
- Oh, 100 percent.
- Yeah.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.559
<i>So I don't know
a lot about these motors.</i>

24:37.643 --> 24:42.064
This is an LS-1
out of a, like, 2002 Corvette.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.191
And it's a, like, sequential shifter?

24:44.650 --> 24:48.654
It's actually a two-speed transmission.
So basically one shift and...

24:48.821 --> 24:50.072
- Okay.
- ...that's it.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.574
That makes it easy.
Mind if I take a picture?

24:52.658 --> 24:53.784
Go for it.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.955
So what do you got over here?
Lamborghini Huracán?

24:58.038 --> 25:01.875
Yeah. Just a Huracán.
It's bone stock, four-wheel drive on.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.639
I'm interested to see
how it does out here.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.796
- Yeah, me too.
- What do you think?

25:05.963 --> 25:08.424
<i>I'm curious
how the electronics work on the dirt.</i>

25:08.507 --> 25:10.884
Well, when you do the launch mode,
all the traction,

25:11.051 --> 25:13.220
- stability control's completely off.
- Oh, really?

25:13.387 --> 25:14.387
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.808
If I wind up facing the wrong way,
then, you know, come up with plan B.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.687
Don't look
too close at the turbos.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.439
How much does
an oil change cost?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.496
Don't know.
So this actually isn't my car.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.057
- Whose car is it?
- My friend's. I borrowed it.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.405
- Yeah, that's a nice friend.
- Yeah.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.532
So you haven't driven this car
a whole lot?

25:33.615 --> 25:35.868
This next launch I'm gonna do
on my test run will be

25:35.951 --> 25:37.828
- my fourth launch in it ever.
- Okay.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.831
And to be honest, it's probably
my fifth quarter-mile race ever.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.125
So I'm extreme amateur.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.127
I'm just curious
to what your computer does

25:45.252 --> 25:47.212
- to what my hand does, you know?
- Right.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.924
- Man versus machine.
- It totally is.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.844
If I win, can I have
your emblem off the back?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.139
He's only raced it, I guess, four times,

25:57.222 --> 26:00.476
so the experience isn't really there.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.644
But the car does have a computer,

26:02.728 --> 26:05.939
and literally, he said
it's like playing a video game.

26:06.023 --> 26:10.194
So we're pretty much
man versus machine, you know?

26:11.904 --> 26:14.948
<i>Lunch Money. You know, he knows
what he's doing. He's got the setup.</i>

26:15.324 --> 26:17.367
He's definitely
a serious contender out here.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.531
- All right. Bring it. What's next?
- I know. Here it comes, I think.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.247
On a trailer.

26:30.297 --> 26:34.301
<i>This ain't my type of racing,
so I've never raced dirt before.</i>

26:34.551 --> 26:36.637
<i>It's not my cup of tea.
It's gonna be interesting.</i>

26:36.804 --> 26:38.430
<i>I'm actually excited.</i>

26:39.389 --> 26:41.670
- So good to see you again.
- Hey, buddy. How y'all doing?

26:41.767 --> 26:43.102
- I'm Stefan.
- Stefan, Pepper.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.561
- Which car you got?
- The Lambo.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.450
- The Lambo? Corey, how you doing?
- Corey.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.899
You want to give us some hints?
What's going on here?

26:48.982 --> 26:51.860
It's just a... small-block Ford
with one stage of nitrous.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.737
- How small-block?
- 427.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.615
- Oh, that's big, big small block.
- Yeah, big small.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.160
- What about y'all?
- 1927 Dodge, LS-1.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.329
- Oh, God.
- Small shot.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.790
How small of a shot?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.292
- Small.
- Cool.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.420
- What you gonna try to do, hard launch?
- I don't know.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.756
- You gonna see how your test runs go?
- Yeah.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.341
We're just gonna play it by ear.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.385
Come on, guys. You got balls.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.158
- Do you want to bet anything?
- Yeah.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.933
- How much?
- Well, let's see what all shows up.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.977
Well, come on,
let's get them balls out.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.105
I mean, you know,
if we want to act arrogant.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.067
- All right.
<i>- Yeah, I don't like him.</i>

27:32.276 --> 27:33.902
He really rubbed me the wrong way.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.488
<i>I don't know.
There's a lot going on in my head,</i>

27:36.572 --> 27:40.784
<i>and I'm really just trying to, like,
stay calm and just race my own race.</i>

27:42.661 --> 27:43.704
We'll see.

27:48.125 --> 27:49.168
We'll see.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.461
This is like my fifth time
drag racing, anyways.

27:51.545 --> 27:55.132
- So... it's pretty much all new to me.
- Yeah.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.892
<i>I think the El Mirage
is gonna be a lot of fun,</i>

28:05.017 --> 28:07.060
<i>especially for my situation
and my truck.</i>

28:07.436 --> 28:11.732
<i>I mean, what better vehicle
to go to an event</i>

28:11.815 --> 28:13.942
<i>that's a drag race on dirt
than a truck.</i>

28:14.067 --> 28:16.361
<i>I mean, you know,
cars don't belong on the dirt.</i>

28:16.445 --> 28:18.030
<i>That's why cars are on the street.</i>

28:20.782 --> 28:23.785
- Yeah, good morning.
- I'm good.

28:24.620 --> 28:29.082
That Dodge truck's tires, you know?
He's got four massive off-road tires.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.918
It was made for this.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.089
I love that it's a Dodge,
you know?

28:36.423 --> 28:38.842
And it's good that we can put
the Dodges in first and second.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.802
Can't guarantee
which position you'll be in,

28:41.011 --> 28:42.512
but we'll be in first and second.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.433
I think the diesel's
going to do very well.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.145
I think so too.
I think we're gonna be surprised by it.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.482
I don't think any of these cars here
can beat me, but we'll see what happens.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.005
It's gonna be a learning experience.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.872
How many more supercars are gonna
show up or is it all sleeper cars?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.905
I don't know.
I think it's gonna be a good mix.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.866
<i>Ron, he's a nice guy,
really nice guy.</i>

29:02.950 --> 29:04.826
<i>Seems pretty cool.
Got a really cool truck.</i>

29:05.327 --> 29:08.080
<i>I think he probably has an advantage
on leaving on the line,</i>

29:08.163 --> 29:11.083
but I think I'm gonna do
a high gear drive-by, so.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.382
<i>Since the last race,
I had motor problems,</i>

29:18.632 --> 29:20.175
<i>and I was very upset with it.</i>

29:20.259 --> 29:23.512
<i>I did the opposite of what everybody else
told me to do, and it actually worked.</i>

29:23.595 --> 29:25.515
<i>But I got it running better enough
for this race.</i>

29:33.772 --> 29:34.898
Uh-oh.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.817
Fuck it!

29:37.734 --> 29:39.444
<i>Sick of fucking starting this thing.</i>

29:45.284 --> 29:48.203
<i>I knew nothing
about El Mirage dry lake bed</i>

29:48.328 --> 29:51.039
<i>until a couple weeks ago,
kind of researched it, and I looked it up.</i>

29:51.206 --> 29:52.791
<i>And I was like, holy shit.</i>

29:57.129 --> 29:58.922
Of course I've got to take a piss.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.592
Introduce yourself.
Everyone, this is Ryan.

30:02.676 --> 30:06.096
- Ryan, this is everyone.
- Ryan, welcome to the lake bed.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.015
- Nice to meet you. Ryan.
- I'm Ron.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.990
- So you haven't raced here.
- What's up? I'm Pepper.

30:10.014 --> 30:11.393
- Ryan.
- Ryan, good to meet you.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.538
- What you driving?
- The Lamborghini way down there.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.397
- Have you raced out here? No?
- No. No.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.625
- They got lots of in Texas.
- Have you raced out here?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.209
Fuck, no!
I'm all the way from Michigan.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.653
I'd have came with tires like that
if I'd have known.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.740
You've got to put on the right dancing
shoes for the area you're going.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.242
- I'm just winging it.
- What happened to your foot?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.745
- Fucking burned my leg.
- Oh, boy.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.247
- How?
- Kicked the fire like a dumbass.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.708
- Where are you from, again?
- Fort Worth, Texas.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.791
- Texas?
- Yeah.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.465
- Blake Williams.
- My best friend.

30:41.631 --> 30:45.177
He had an identical car to this.
We built this as a duplicate.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.639
Guy lost control at one of our tracks
and hit him and killed him.

30:50.724 --> 30:51.767
Sorry to hear about that.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.187
So we built this car as a tribute car,
if you will.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.273
Yeah, my truck's kind of in memory
of my buddy Brandon Newman.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.192
He passed away,
so we're in the same thing.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.110
- Yeah. So...
- Bad-ass.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.405
<i>My buddy Brandon Newman,
he was a good friend to everybody.</i>

31:05.614 --> 31:07.407
<i>If you needed anything, he would be there.</i>

31:07.532 --> 31:11.244
Basically, I made my truck fast
in memory of him.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.497
He got mixed up in a wrong crowd.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.918
I believe someone dared him
to do some drugs,

31:18.835 --> 31:21.004
and, you know, they thought
it was funny or something.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.173
He actually did it,
and they were like, "Oh, fuck."

31:23.256 --> 31:24.716
And then, he didn't wake up.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.602
<i>If I win, he's gonna love it.</i>

31:37.020 --> 31:38.855
<i>When I see a car in memory of somebody,</i>

31:38.980 --> 31:40.857
<i>I want to hear the story
and see what happened.</i>

31:41.024 --> 31:43.819
<i>But you don't want to keep bringing
it up, if it's a touchy story.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:47.114
When someone asks me what happened
to my buddy, or asks us why it says that,

31:47.239 --> 31:49.825
I get goosebumps. I get chills.
It really gets to me.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.703
I'm feeling kind of lonely out here.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.958
I was expecting at least maybe,
you know, a healthy mix, but so far,

31:59.251 --> 32:01.461
<i>I'm the only guy in a car
that hasn't been built</i>

32:02.087 --> 32:04.506
<i>by their bare hands.
Got two more cars coming.</i>

32:04.714 --> 32:07.050
There has to be one, at least,
one exotic coming.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.260
I can't be the only one.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.472
<i>El Mirage is extremely dangerous.
It's just dirt.</i>

32:12.639 --> 32:15.475
<i>Most of the people that go on
these dry lake beds or salt flats,</i>

32:15.559 --> 32:17.227
<i>they do it from rolling speed.</i>

32:17.519 --> 32:21.314
<i>We have to do it from a dead standstill,
which makes it extremely difficult,</i>

32:21.398 --> 32:23.108
<i>being in a front-wheel drive car as well.</i>

32:23.191 --> 32:24.985
How you doing?
Good to see you, Tony.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.788
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.606
Are you ready for the dust this time?

32:29.698 --> 32:31.700
I see that little filter
you've got in the front.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.952
- Good to see you. Thanks for coming out.
- Definitely.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.204
Tony, this is everyone.
Everyone, this is Tony.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.369
- I'm Ron. Nice to meet you.
- Tony. How's it going?

32:38.665 --> 32:41.960
So just one car left
until I'm the only exotic.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.213
If it's just me, the pressure's on.
I represent the supercar world.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.673
<i>I can't lose.</i>

32:47.924 --> 32:49.217
=Here comes the other car.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.432
- Is that a girl? Get the fuck out of here.
- What?

32:55.515 --> 32:57.684
- I don't know, I see hair.
- Yeah, that's a girl.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.025
<i>To see a woman in a man's world,
it's always interesting.</i>

33:05.108 --> 33:07.903
<i>And you put the time in,
and you're just as good as they are.</i>

33:08.028 --> 33:10.322
<i>It's... the car is the big equalizer.</i>

33:10.697 --> 33:12.657
- All righty then.
- Good to see you again.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.535
Nice to see you guys, too.
Oh, my God, I love the socks.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.620
- Those are great.
- Thanks for coming out.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.080
Happy to be here.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.301
- Good to see you again.
- Very cool.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.751
<i>I think it's cool.</i>

33:22.834 --> 33:25.670
<i>There's a lot of females that can drive
good, so I think it's cool.</i>

33:25.795 --> 33:27.297
<i>My sister's a girl and she races.</i>

33:27.547 --> 33:30.842
So I mean, you know, she's a bad-ass,
so I'm sure she is too.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.553
We got all kinds of oddball stuff
going on out here,

33:33.637 --> 33:36.139
so I figured there'd be at least
one female driver.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.520
<i>As a young girl,
I got inspired from a woman</i>

33:41.603 --> 33:44.523
<i>that was a drag racer,
Shirley Muldowney.</i>

33:44.898 --> 33:47.359
<i>When I saw people get around her,</i>

33:47.442 --> 33:49.694
<i>and her get her helmet on
and her gloves,</i>

33:50.529 --> 33:51.863
it was pretty cool.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.616
<i>If I can just make women feel like,</i>

33:54.741 --> 33:58.286
<i>"Hey, I'm a girl and I'm doing this,
you can do the same."</i>

33:58.453 --> 33:59.913
<i>It's a great feeling.</i>

33:59.996 --> 34:01.998
- Lisa, this is everybody.
- Hello!

34:02.082 --> 34:03.542
- Hi, everybody.
- This is Lisa.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.293
- Lisa.
- This is gonna be great.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.671
- Welcome to the lake bed.
- Happy to be here.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.714
- Drivers, who else? Drivers?
- Here.

34:09.797 --> 34:10.799
- I'm Corey.
- Corey.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.569
- Hot rod down there that you'll see.
- Very cool, Corey. Hi, Lisa.

34:13.592 --> 34:15.530
- This is Rob, he's on our team.
- Rob, very cool.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.181
Should've heard the guesses
as you were way off in the distance.

34:18.473 --> 34:21.685
They were like, is that an Aventador?
No, a Huracán, no, an Enzo.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.813
I see one over there somewhere
in this midst. Whose is that?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.898
- The Huracán's mine.
- Is that... hi, I'm Lisa.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.483
- Pepper.
- Pepper, nice to meet you.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.068
- You too.
- Great car you have, wow.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.114
You know what? I'm really happy
that at least another supercar showed up.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.721
- Yeah, was wondering if there were others.
- Thought I was gonna be the lone warrior.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.824
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:40.078 --> 34:44.416
<i>Sleeper cars, I think,
have a good chance off this start.</i>

34:44.498 --> 34:49.087
Where I think the supercars...
you've got that "see you later" moment.

34:50.170 --> 34:53.174
So, first, before we get started,
I want to say thank you for coming out.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.094
And I want to congratulate you
for making it to the finals, so.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.180
Definitely some interesting vehicles.

34:59.848 --> 35:03.727
Hearing some of the stories...
it'll be a good race.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.820
<i>It'll be a real good race.
I mean, there's...</i>

35:05.937 --> 35:07.897
<i>There's definitely,
definitely some talent here.</i>

35:08.023 --> 35:11.276
<i>So, they're just, none of them
are set up for dirt, you know?</i>

35:11.359 --> 35:14.237
That's the biggest thing,
is I'd be worried out on the pavement,

35:14.446 --> 35:16.364
I really would.
But I'm not too worried here.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.409
People don't expect trucks to be fast.
They expect them to be utilitarian.

35:19.576 --> 35:20.816
- <i>Underestimated.
- Yeah.</i>

35:20.869 --> 35:23.431
<i>- People that have trucks stick with them.
- Seems like the underdog.</i>

35:23.455 --> 35:26.249
But I'd rather have this truck
than the damn Lamborghini or Ferrari.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.628
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't... I wouldn't
want the cleaning bill on those cars.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.672
Typically you race one car,
so you think about that one car.

35:32.756 --> 35:36.217
When you think about seven cars, you
lose track of who you try to think about,

35:36.343 --> 35:38.988
- and then another one distracts you.
- Right. The pluses and minuses of each.

35:39.012 --> 35:41.681
Yeah, I'm just gonna run my own race,
that's for sure.

35:42.057 --> 35:45.143
Everyone stays in their lane,
it's all good, right?

35:45.352 --> 35:48.313
She has more racing experience
than I do, by far.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.482
I have never been in Ferrari Challenge.

35:50.815 --> 35:55.153
I think the Ferrari 488
has a good chance of taking it.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.573
<i>It makes more horsepower
than the Lamborghini that's here, so.</i>

36:01.743 --> 36:05.830
We're gonna give you two test runs.
We'll bring in all of the competitors,

36:05.955 --> 36:09.376
line everybody up, and then one by one,
you'll go out and do your two test runs.

36:09.644 --> 36:11.844
Then we'll come back,
and after that, we'll do the race.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.595
Considering the amount
of engineering

36:20.679 --> 36:22.555
that goes into the aerodynamics
of this car...

36:22.639 --> 36:23.765
Yes.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.518
...how unstable I feel down
at the end of this track on this,

36:26.601 --> 36:28.228
<i>I'm really worried. It almost feels like</i>

36:28.311 --> 36:30.146
<i>- I'm about to come up off the ground.
- Okay.</i>

36:30.271 --> 36:32.607
Just 'cause I'm skating around
on this thin layer of dust.

36:32.691 --> 36:36.069
- Okay.
- So... it might be a little dangerous.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.611
<i>After my test run, I'm gonna get
a little bit more aggressive with it.</i>

36:44.703 --> 36:46.621
I could put a little bit
more power to it.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.707
<i>My strategy
for those test runs</i>

36:48.915 --> 36:51.418
is basically one's gonna be
with launch mode,

36:51.835 --> 36:53.795
and one's gonna be in race mode.

36:54.254 --> 36:58.007
And I'm gonna do them both full throttle
and see what the car gives me.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.810
<i>We kind of made our decision
based on a couple things</i>

37:08.893 --> 37:12.814
as far as throttle off the go,
and it seems like for me,

37:13.189 --> 37:16.735
no launch control's
gonna be the best for this surface.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.945
- How you doing, mama?
- Doing good, honey.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.780
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready.

37:20.864 --> 37:23.616
<i>I'll go out and make some test hits
and just see how she feels.</i>

37:24.743 --> 37:28.329
And see what happens literally when
the dust settles out here. All righty.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.124
<i>There's quite a bit of dust
being created off of one car.</i>

37:31.291 --> 37:34.335
Once we go seven-wide,
it's gonna be a mammoth cloud.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.384
That just burned him the fuck out.
But it's moving.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.139
- Fuck.
- Something just let off.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.641
What did Dad just do?
Son of a bitch.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.936
<i>Hey, jump in that one.
I'm gone.</i>

37:57.358 --> 37:58.359
Fuck.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.529
- What?
- We blew a boot.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.072
- What?
- A boot.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.120
- I can hear it.
- Come on guys.

38:09.204 --> 38:10.872
- Watch yourself.
- Go.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.167
<i>With two turbos,
I've created a lot of boost in there,</i>

38:14.417 --> 38:19.172
and the boot that goes between the primary
and secondary turbos looks like

38:19.339 --> 38:22.884
it split. I was hoping it just
popped off, but it looks like it split.

38:23.176 --> 38:26.095
<i>And then we're gonna pull it off
and we're gonna see if it's salvageable.</i>

38:26.221 --> 38:29.641
- Yeah, you got the bottom one?
- No, that's one we're working up to.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.477
This is the first time
I've ever had this pop. So...

38:32.602 --> 38:35.772
that's why I don't even have a spare,
because I've never lost it.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.732
Come on, sweetheart.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.655
<i>It is the most tricky environment
I've ever tried to race a car in.</i>

38:43.822 --> 38:45.342
I'm ready to race.
I don't give a shit.

38:45.907 --> 38:46.907
Go!

38:50.328 --> 38:52.664
<i>I was more excited
after I got to do the test run.</i>

38:52.747 --> 38:55.250
I want to show what I can do,
and that I'm a good racer,

38:55.333 --> 38:58.002
and good driver, and pretty much,
I'll do anything to race.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.587
- There you go.
- I got it.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.383
That's no <i>bueno.</i>
That ain't gonna work.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.177
I know what it's like to be like that.
It ain't good.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.889
We're gonna try and take
an intercooler boot off of Jaime's truck

39:10.098 --> 39:12.767
and put it on to mine,
to get us back up and rolling.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.436
<i>- It's gonna be tight.
- So all we can do is try.</i>

39:15.562 --> 39:16.722
That's all racing is, trying.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.940
<i>You do what you have to do
to make it run.</i>

39:19.023 --> 39:21.568
If you break something
on the Lamborghini or Ferrari...

39:22.068 --> 39:26.072
...it's done for the day. Everybody else,
duct tape and hopes and dreams.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.247
<i>If I felt that I was
so much faster than them,</i>

39:34.873 --> 39:38.668
<i>it wouldn't feel as good.
So to win today, it would feel great.</i>

39:38.751 --> 39:41.379
<i>I mean, there's some serious
fast cars out here.</i>

39:41.462 --> 39:43.548
Sleeper cars, I think they have an edge,

39:43.631 --> 39:47.218
because we're all wanting to go faster
and build something fast.

39:47.302 --> 39:51.097
We're not just buying something
that maybe has 600 horsepower

39:51.180 --> 39:54.350
and some advanced computer
and cool steering wheel, you know?

39:54.434 --> 39:56.936
<i>We're more... performance.</i>

40:08.239 --> 40:11.117
We're ready to go.
It's all we got, so make it or break it.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.952
This is the way
she's going down the track.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.079
<i>All drivers over here, please.</i>

40:16.581 --> 40:18.821
<i>We're about to do something
that hasn't been done before,</i>

40:19.000 --> 40:20.501
and you guys are the first to do it.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.296
So give yourselves
a round of applause, all right?

40:24.172 --> 40:27.425
So I'm about to go over the rules
for the event this afternoon.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.137
The race will start upon
a signal visible to all vehicles.

40:31.512 --> 40:35.475
And that'll be red to green,
and you want to go on green.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.728
What we're gonna do
is have you guys go back to your cars,

40:38.811 --> 40:41.606
and we are gonna go out
to the track area.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.542
- We're gonna do it one by one.
- All right.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.044
- Good luck to everybody.
- Good luck.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.945
Good luck, guys.
Be safe, man. Be safe.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.821
- Have fun. Good luck.
- Yes, you too.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.406
- Good luck.
- Have fun, be safe.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.908
- All right, brother.
- All right.

41:02.961 --> 41:06.547
<i>Strategy is still the same,
what you call pedal the cars.</i>

41:07.298 --> 41:11.678
<i>Come off of idle, and just slowly
accelerate and feel the traction.</i>

41:13.888 --> 41:17.225
<i>I want to show what I can do.
I'll do anything to race, you know?</i>

41:17.767 --> 41:18.893
<i>Nothing's gonna stop me.</i>

41:21.104 --> 41:24.232
<i>Everybody's just gone over
and above to get this truck to this point</i>

41:24.357 --> 41:27.193
<i>and this is what I said we'd do.
We had some failures today,</i>

41:27.360 --> 41:30.154
<i>and hopefully we've got them
patched up enough to get us one hit.</i>

41:30.238 --> 41:31.698
<i>We'll see what happens.</i>

41:32.156 --> 41:35.410
<i>Being a role model for women,
whether you win or lose,</i>

41:35.535 --> 41:37.286
<i>you're out there and you're with the guys.</i>

41:37.370 --> 41:39.998
<i>That kind of just shows
that you can put your mind to something,</i>

41:40.123 --> 41:41.666
<i>and you can compete against anybody.</i>

41:42.208 --> 41:45.086
<i>I'm gonna win this race.
I have confidence in my car.</i>

41:45.253 --> 41:46.671
<i>I think I've got these other guys.</i>

41:47.088 --> 41:49.808
<i>It's a lot of unknowns out here,
and I'm still feeling good.</i>

41:49.924 --> 41:53.678
<i>It's up to me to be quick on the reaction,
and up to the car to perform its best.</i>

41:55.221 --> 41:58.850
<i>Blake would probably be saying,
"You got it. Don't worry about them.</i>

41:59.100 --> 42:00.309
<i>Go fuck them up."</i>

42:39.474 --> 42:40.474
Fuck!

43:15.218 --> 43:17.178
The Lamborghini
has taken the first spot.

43:26.562 --> 43:29.857
<i>Second is a photo finish
between the Ferrari and the Thunderbird.</i>

43:30.108 --> 43:31.108
Fuck!

43:42.453 --> 43:44.163
Well, that fucking sucked.

43:46.582 --> 43:47.750
Hey, mom.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.461
- <i>How are you?
- Guess what?</i>

43:50.878 --> 43:52.088
<i>What?</i>

43:52.880 --> 43:54.549
Pretty sure I just won the race.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.552
<i>What do you mean
you're pretty sure?</i>

43:58.177 --> 43:59.512
I definitely won the race.

44:13.442 --> 44:16.445
<i>I looked out my left,
didn't see a single car.</i>

44:16.571 --> 44:19.907
<i>And I was just, this can't be real.
I was starting to feel pretty good.</i>

44:20.074 --> 44:22.160
<i>You know, I was like,
I have so much free time,</i>

44:22.243 --> 44:23.595
<i>I'm gonna look at my miles per hour.</i>

44:23.619 --> 44:26.205
And I hit 131
right before I crossed the finish line.

44:26.539 --> 44:29.625
Amazing. Man. Steak dinner tonight.

44:29.709 --> 44:32.044
I've been vegan
for, like, three and a half weeks,

44:32.128 --> 44:34.630
but this deserves steak,
perhaps even lobster,

44:34.797 --> 44:36.132
with a side of chicken wings.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.718
<i>That Huracán kicked my ass
off the get-go.</i>

44:38.801 --> 44:41.095
<i>I think ever me or the Ferrari
came in second.</i>

44:41.262 --> 44:43.848
It was, like, really tight.
I think it's gonna be a photo finish.

44:43.931 --> 44:44.891
It was hard to tell.

44:44.892 --> 44:46.934
<i>I don't know I bumped it
into high gear,</i>

44:47.059 --> 44:49.687
but somehow, I just, like,
my glove, you know, obviously.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.064
Just the tiniest little bit of pressure.

44:52.148 --> 44:53.900
It was a stupid little error

44:53.983 --> 44:57.320
that just put us back
right at the beginning.

44:57.486 --> 44:59.280
- Nice job, nice job.
- Hey, you too.

44:59.363 --> 45:02.575
I didn't get to see where you ended up.
It was like a cloud of dust.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.827
Yeah. I blew a boot,
so I was coasting halfway.

45:05.161 --> 45:08.539
Yeah, I think I leave before everyone,
'cause my tires turned, yeah.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.833
But I sit still, spinning,
and you're just...

45:10.917 --> 45:12.919
- Yeah.
- It was like a slingshot, literally.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.129
<i>It's like somebody
just pulled him back and let it go</i>

45:15.213 --> 45:17.924
like the cars we used to play with,
you know?

45:18.007 --> 45:20.468
I'm still at the start line,
he's already four cones in front.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.720
- Yeah, he was gone.
- He was gone.

45:22.887 --> 45:25.181
So do you guys have any idea
who was, like, second, third?

45:25.306 --> 45:27.850
- It's either me and her,
- Do you know how they were?

45:28.017 --> 45:30.645
I was trying to look left,
and I didn't see nothing left.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.772
And then, you know, I looked right,
and I seen you,

45:32.855 --> 45:36.317
and I seen you way on, I had to look
through my front windshield to see you.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.902
- Seriously, right?
- Yeah.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.625
He was already, you were...
you were gone.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.256
- Yeah.
- But me and you were close, dude.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.280
- Yeah.
- You had me.

45:42.281 --> 45:45.409
You came up and started driving by me,
and right as you were driving by me,

45:45.534 --> 45:48.955
my nitrous finally came on.
And I think I really think I nosed you.

45:49.038 --> 45:50.706
- You might have.
- It's gonna be close.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.708
Because I saw you right there,
I'm like, shit.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.877
See, that's the kind of finish
I like to see.

45:54.961 --> 45:57.838
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- The black car could've beat me.

45:57.964 --> 46:00.216
I mean, we were neck and neck
there at the end.

46:00.341 --> 46:02.510
I might have eked out second, but...

46:03.302 --> 46:05.429
we'll see what the replay shows.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.182
You guys put on a show.
You, each and every one of you,

46:08.307 --> 46:10.434
you guys should be really proud
of what you did.

46:10.518 --> 46:11.936
So thank you so much for that.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.105
Now we have the results.

46:15.690 --> 46:18.567
Starting in seventh place,
we have Ron.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.569
- Oh.
- Good run.

46:20.653 --> 46:23.239
I wasn't... I wasn't last!
I wasn't last!

46:23.489 --> 46:25.408
Try to tell us a little bit
about what happened.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.201
Basically, just before half track,

46:27.285 --> 46:28.845
- I lost that boot again.
- Okay.

46:28.911 --> 46:31.247
So I was on all motor
the rest of the trip.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.874
So, you know,
there was no power there.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.168
- It was coasting, unfortunately.
- Outstanding. Okay.

46:36.711 --> 46:39.964
And we have in sixth place,
we have Tony.

46:41.757 --> 46:44.051
- Wasn't last. I wasn't last.
- Good job, buddy.

46:44.427 --> 46:46.530
- Thank you for blowing that top, buddy.
- No problem.

46:46.554 --> 46:48.139
Thank you.

46:48.347 --> 46:51.517
And in fifth place we have...
Ryan in the S-10.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.729
Good job, buddy.

46:54.979 --> 46:59.066
Good stuff. All right,
and in fourth place, we have Corey.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.239
And it was a solid run.
I mean, you looked good, start to finish.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.634
- It was all right.
- Tell us a little bit about it.

47:07.658 --> 47:08.616
It was human error.

47:08.617 --> 47:12.955
I accidentally bumped it into high gear
probably 60 feet out...

47:13.205 --> 47:15.416
And... yeah.

47:15.499 --> 47:19.295
- I made up some, so not too bad.
- Okay, cool. Cool. All right.

47:19.587 --> 47:22.923
And second and third place,
it was a photo finish.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.760
But after reviewing the footage,
third place...

47:28.846 --> 47:29.804
is Lisa.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.519
Look who's got me.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.857
All right. And in second place,

47:40.274 --> 47:43.778
beating a Ferrari,
we have Stefan.

47:45.946 --> 47:48.407
It was, it was close.
It was really close.

47:48.783 --> 47:53.245
I mean, we took off. I spun.
I think all of us spun but him, you know?

47:53.579 --> 47:57.750
And she... she... you know,
I ran out of motor to like half-track,

47:57.833 --> 48:00.586
<i>and then she started to drive by me.</i>

48:00.669 --> 48:03.798
<i>And then right as my nitrous came on,
I was like, get over here.</i>

48:03.881 --> 48:07.343
<i>And I had to just... had to,
I couldn't beat her by more than much.</i>

48:07.426 --> 48:10.179
<i>- It was barely, but...</i>
- It was a photo finish.

48:10.262 --> 48:11.555
No, I knew it was close.

48:11.639 --> 48:15.601
And you actually beat a Ferrari
with a car that you built yourself.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.645
It's an old small-block Ford,
nothing fancy.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.356
Hats off to both of you. All right.

48:20.439 --> 48:22.316
And our winner...

48:23.025 --> 48:24.985
is... Pepper.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.446
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

48:28.864 --> 48:30.449
Yeah.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.576
- Thank you.
- There you go. There you go.

48:33.786 --> 48:35.454
<i>Man. It's a dream come true.</i>

48:36.080 --> 48:38.749
Kind of nervous when I saw that big truck
pulling out ahead of me,

48:38.958 --> 48:40.798
but then I looked out my window
and saw no one.

48:40.876 --> 48:44.588
I realized the car was doing its thing.
I mean, it's, it's just a beast.

48:44.797 --> 48:47.258
This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,
and, you know,

48:47.341 --> 48:49.885
the fact that the top two are from Texas,
the second place,

48:49.969 --> 48:52.972
also built by himself, beat a Ferrari.

48:53.431 --> 48:56.725
You know, built in a garage with passion,
blood, sweat, tears, tons of effort.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.311
The fact that you came out here
and defeated a supercar,

48:59.395 --> 49:01.480
you know, photo finish, that's exciting.

49:01.564 --> 49:03.649
You know, with that much passion,
it doesn't matter.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.359
There's a way to beat them,

49:05.484 --> 49:07.361
and it's the passion behind cars,
for sure.

49:07.987 --> 49:10.448
- Uh-oh.
- Here we go! There we go!

49:13.659 --> 49:16.829
<i>We're all from different walks
of life. We've never met each other.</i>

49:16.912 --> 49:19.623
<i>I think we've all
really have an appreciation</i>

49:19.832 --> 49:22.751
<i>for whatever anyone drives
or plays around with.</i>

49:23.252 --> 49:24.837
<i>It's that respect.</i>

49:25.087 --> 49:28.090
<i>Supercars are beautiful, you know?
They're built for one purpose.</i>

49:28.174 --> 49:29.884
<i>Look good and go fast.</i>

49:30.050 --> 49:33.888
I still stand behind my real race-cars
are built, not bought.

49:34.096 --> 49:36.891
<i>It took a lot out of me.
I could've quit so many times.</i>

49:36.974 --> 49:39.894
<i>I kept going. Just got to fix what you can
and keep running with it.</i>

49:40.144 --> 49:42.229
<i>If my car was all-wheel drive,
I would've won.</i>

49:42.438 --> 49:45.149
No doubt in my mind.
No doubt in my mind whatsoever.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.817
I would've fucked that Lambo up.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.946
But I brought a knife to a gunfight.
It is what it is.

49:51.071 --> 49:52.615
I lost. End of story.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.409
<i>I screwed it up from the get-go.
It was an error.</i>

49:55.659 --> 49:57.703
<i>I just barely bumped it,
and went into high gear.</i>

49:57.828 --> 50:01.499
- And after that, it was over.
- I didn't have a really good run.

50:02.374 --> 50:06.629
The car just didn't give what I had...
it did in the test sessions for me.

50:06.921 --> 50:09.840
I think I did okay. I think I did okay
for the sleeper cars, too.

50:09.965 --> 50:13.135
<i>I mean, I came in second.
Hey, that's respectable.</i>

50:13.427 --> 50:16.597
<i>I mean, I'm the first loser,
but hey, fuck a supercar up.</i>

50:17.389 --> 50:18.641
<i>I think Blake would be happy.</i>

50:20.726 --> 50:23.187
Yeah. I think he'd be happy.

50:28.734 --> 50:29.985
<i>It's been a long one.</i>

50:30.069 --> 50:32.339
<i>This is something I've been working
towards my whole life.</i>

50:32.363 --> 50:34.949
<i>I started taking pictures of cars
out of a pure hobby.</i>

50:35.115 --> 50:37.701
<i>I had no idea it would lead me
to different corners of the world.</i>

50:37.785 --> 50:40.996
<i>And who would've thought that would've
led to me racing a Lamborghini</i>

50:41.080 --> 50:42.915
in the middle of the desert and winning?
