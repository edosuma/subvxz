PHONE VIBRATES

00:03.040 --> 00:04.240
I'm so sorry, everyone,

00:04.240 --> 00:05.480
something's come up.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.080
He was still breathing. Just.

00:07.080 --> 00:10.240
Don't ask me to do something
like that again. It were too close.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.440
I wouldn't be here without you.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.440
It's Owen, just come straight
to the hospital.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.640
I'm afraid Owen
has bacterial meningitis.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.640
He could've been like that
the whole time.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.960
You didn't check on him for
three hours!  Where were you?!

00:20.960 --> 00:22.680
Please don't die. Please don't die.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.560
What did he look like?
He had a balaclava on.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.400
But you could still see
his dodgy teeth.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.680
I can't make this one go away, Col.
Everyone knows it's Noel.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.920
This can never happen again,
Lou, OK?

00:32.920 --> 00:35.280
Promise me that.
No.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.760
"No?"

00:45.000 --> 00:48.720
Do you know what I'm not, Col?
I'm not the all-seeing eye.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.680
I'm not a miracle worker
or the bloody Invisible Man.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.360
And I'm not a lifetime guarantee
that no-one from your firm

00:54.360 --> 00:55.760
will ever get nicked again.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.640
So, yeah. No.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.080
If I judge that I have no choice,

01:00.080 --> 01:02.840
or it's better for you
to take a little hit for once,

01:02.840 --> 01:06.000
or someone's breathing down my neck
and I have to be whiter-than-white,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.760
then I will do what I have to,
for both of us!

01:08.760 --> 01:11.600
You can keep putting that vibe on,
Bulgey, you do not scare me!

01:17.440 --> 01:20.080
How long have we been friends,
Col? Hmm?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.480
19 years?

01:22.840 --> 01:25.600
Now, God knows you've got no
shortage of bootlickers lining up

01:25.600 --> 01:27.080
to tremble at your every word.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.640
But I'm not one of them.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.800
I provide you with
something more valuable.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.600
I don't bullshit you,
and I treat you like an equal,

01:33.600 --> 01:35.440
like a partner, like a pal -

01:35.440 --> 01:37.800
because that is what we're
supposed to be.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.080
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.520
Leave it with me.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.400
You OK?  Yep.
What the hell's going on?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.040
Where've you been?
Don't matter. I'm fine.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.560
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

02:16.560 --> 02:18.800
Can we just talk about it in
the morning, Cer, please.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.280
Has she been out?  Yeah, but I'm not
waiting till the morning.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.880
I've been having kittens here.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.000
That lad I pinched.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.400
Was one of Col's.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.640
Col told me not to.
But I did it, anyway.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.560
OK. Why?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.240
I don't know.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.960
I don't know! He'd messed up
this old lady's face.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.320
And I don't know,
can we please leave it?  No.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.480
You said, "Something's changed".

02:42.480 --> 02:44.360
Earlier on, you said,
"Something's changed".

02:44.360 --> 02:46.200
What did you mean?
I was just having a moment.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.560
You don't have "moments".

02:47.560 --> 02:49.800
Well there's a first time for
everything, all right?

02:49.800 --> 02:52.000
But it's over, OK?
I've sorted it with him, it's done.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.920
I could really live without
the third degree tonight, Cer.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.680
I'm going to take her
out for a wazz.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.440
I've just told you, she's been out!

03:07.720 --> 03:09.160
Please don't die.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.200
MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS

04:08.480 --> 04:09.880
What the hell are you doing?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.320
He asked me to.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.720
And you just agreed?

04:17.520 --> 04:20.080
They're only going to remind him
of what he's lost.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.320
He hasn't "lost" anything.
He's going to get better.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.640
You know that he might not.
This is who he is, Ceri!

04:27.360 --> 04:29.920
Lou, we have to let go
of some things, so that he can.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.440
Don't try and play the hard man,
Donal.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.320
Marta. Been too long.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.480
Col.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.400
Sorry to hear about your daughter.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.560
Thank you for meeting here.
My schedule's tight.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.400
I understand. If you don't mind
going through the rigmarole?

05:13.640 --> 05:16.640
It's a drug port. Chemotherapy.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.280
I'll still need to, er...

05:35.320 --> 05:39.640
So, got to chat to our friends?
We did.

05:41.480 --> 05:45.440
And we passed on everything
you wanted us to.  Good.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.880
But I'm sorry, the news isn't good.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.280
They can't increase your
order any further.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.160
The amount stays the same, for now.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.640
That's a real shame.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.120
That's a real shame.
Can I ask why?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.920
The whole region has had
two very dry summers.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.680
That means poor harvests,
poor yields.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.920
You're lucky not
to have a reduced shipment.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.640
So, we should've listened to
the tree-huggers, is that it?

06:14.080 --> 06:17.120
What if I offered a wee premium?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.760
Say, I don't know,
like 5% over the top or...?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.200
It's not about money.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.360
The product isn't there.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.120
You've increased your order
twice already in a year.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.520
A lot of hungry mouths out there,
Marta.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.800
And if I don't feed them,
then somebody else will.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.320
You see, our friends have
put me in a real bind.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.640
They'll be very sad to hear that.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.000
Could they not introduce us
to someone else? Who's got surplus?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.480
Your son? I can see it.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.400
Can you?

06:52.400 --> 06:54.920
I'm sorry, I have to make a flight.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.320
Bye.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.760
Don't.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.040
PAPERS SLAM Ballistics report.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.560
The gun you got off Noel Wilkes

07:22.560 --> 07:24.800
is the same one
that killed Thomas Ajazi.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.680
The kid who was shot in the pub.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.920
Now don't get excited,
I've already checked.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.520
Wilkes is in the clear.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.080
He were in Manchester overnight,
got him all over the cameras

07:33.080 --> 07:35.600
at the Premier Inn - but he has
to know the shooter, right?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.800
I mean, I know he won't talk,
but would you mind?

07:38.800 --> 07:40.280
You have got a way.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.560
Anything for you, Phil.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.720
Here, Cowpat, speaking of Wilkes,
what happened to his cousin?

07:48.720 --> 07:50.040
Interview and a lift home.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.400
What, no victim support
or counselling?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.760
There's no note on the file.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.760
Counselling? She took a kebab to
her cousin and got stoned.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.720
He took her hostage.
For three minutes.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.080
He fired a shot at us.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.280
If you're over Garforth way,
will you give her a knock later?

08:06.280 --> 08:08.280
Why would I be over Garforth way?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.400
ON PHONE:  This is Jade.
Don't leave a voicemail.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.520
Hit me up on WhatsApp.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.160
Hiya, Jade, it's Detective
Inspector Louisa Slack.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.600
We met the other day in brief,
but memorable fashion.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.400
Can you give us a call back
when you get this?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.880
Just want to check you're OK.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.920
KNOCK ON DOOR

08:26.080 --> 08:28.840
Jade? I'm a friend of your cousin.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.840
I heard what happened. You OK?

08:31.840 --> 08:33.720
I'm fine, thanks.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.800
How do you know Noel?  From work.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.600
I just check you're OK.
You don't, you don't need something?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.080
I'm fine, ta.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.280
Who you tell about your cousin?

08:46.280 --> 08:47.720
What're you on about?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.040
Police found the flat.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.040
You told someone where he was. Who?

08:51.040 --> 08:53.120
No-one. I didn't tell no-one,
look...

08:53.120 --> 08:55.200
Oi! What you doing?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.960
You can't just come in here!
Oi! Leave me alone!

09:02.360 --> 09:04.520
We could just press pause.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.160
You know me,
I'm all for extra business...

09:08.640 --> 09:10.720
..but we're ticking along nicely.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.560
A second supplier doubles our risk.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.080
Yeah, good idea, Curtis.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.200
That's a very good idea.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.520
Let's press pause.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.120
Better yet, let's just take a gap
year and go travelling, y'know?

09:23.120 --> 09:26.080
Maybe we could all volunteer
on a fucking elephant sanctuary.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.480
We do not "press pause".

09:30.480 --> 09:32.440
Not now, not fucking ever.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.880
We go forward.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.080
And we keep pushing
as hard as we can, right?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.120
Get what we need elsewhere.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.560
She's got cancer.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.040
Marta.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.040
Stop trying to cheer me up.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.320
PHONE RINGS

10:01.680 --> 10:02.720
Yeah?

10:04.400 --> 10:05.920
You sure?

10:06.920 --> 10:08.640
OK.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.840
Cheers.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.320
Bulgey spoke to Noel's cousin.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.560
She swears she didn't tell anyone
else where the safehouse was.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.280
He believes her.

10:27.320 --> 10:31.120
Kevin's chasing the CPS,
and he'll let the rest of us know.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.360
Now, here's a good 'un.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.840
Terrace in Hyde Park
is having a loft conversion.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.200
The builders are putting
the steels in when they get a look

10:38.200 --> 10:39.480
in next door's skylight -

10:39.480 --> 10:42.880
the blind's broken, and it looks
like the Rainforest Cafe in there.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.560
A car dropped by,
the electric's been bypassed.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.560
And, yeah, wouldn't you know it,
the council tax is paid

10:48.560 --> 10:51.200
by somebody who appears
to have died seven years ago.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.560
Well, there has been a bit of chat
about the McHughs having

10:53.560 --> 10:55.000
a farm 'round there somewhere.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.960
The most amazing part of the story
is the conscientious builders.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.360
They can come and do my pointing.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.560
Do we really think McHugh would
bother with a domestic dope farm?

11:03.560 --> 11:06.000
I'm dubious.
He makes millions importing coke.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.160
I don't know why he'd bother
with a little weed grow?

11:08.160 --> 11:09.560
Well, it's being raided.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.920
Esther, you stay across it.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.640
OK, go forth.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.160
Erm, the Super weren't
exactly cock-a-hoop with

11:23.160 --> 11:24.360
your Noel Wilkes arrest.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.160
Few too many rules bent
for his liking.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.520
He wants it tidied up.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.000
So, the informant that told you
where Wilkes was -

11:30.000 --> 11:32.560
you're to get them on the books,
in case he changes his plea.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.640
And Esther's going to be
asked for her side.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.560
But, well, unless she lands you
in it, that should be that.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.040
All right?  All right, cheers, San.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.600
This can never happen again.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.640
Ever. You promise me that?

12:00.640 --> 12:02.320
No.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.920
PHONE RINGS Est?

12:23.920 --> 12:27.240
We're going in.
Let me know what you find.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.720
And hold your breath,
or you'll get the munchies.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.080
Police!  Police!  Police!
Stay where you are!

12:41.080 --> 12:44.320
Nobody home!  Police!

12:45.640 --> 12:48.080
ELECTRICAL HUM

12:56.840 --> 12:58.280
Nobody home.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.360
What do you think?  Oh, love it.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.000
Mm-hm.  Love that one.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.560
Maybe for the six best units?  Hmm.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.840
Colum?

13:12.840 --> 13:15.160
Sure, that's...that's the one.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.000
Pretend to care, darling.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.840
Men.  One second. THEY CHUCKLE

13:30.280 --> 13:32.120
Me Hyde Park grow just got raided.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.480
Is it clean?

13:39.560 --> 13:42.000
Is it clean, Donal?

13:42.000 --> 13:46.840
Yeah.  Right, right, well,
clear the other two out. Now.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.520
The plants are almost mature.
Two more weeks, I'll have it down...

13:49.520 --> 13:52.640
Clear the other two out!
Today, Donal.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.520
Do you have to be so hard with him?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.680
Aye I do, aye.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.920
He never gets to impress you.
You never give him the chance to.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.920
You ask me, she can't be trusted.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.040
You don't know what you're
talking about.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.600
Listen, we don't know
what we don't know.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.240
The weed farm could've been
anything - neighbours, electricity
company.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.960
And as for Noel,
maybe there WAS a tip-off.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.000
Maybe some little knobhead with
a beef saw Noel there.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Or maybe Noel did tell someone else,
you wouldn't put it past him.

14:32.840 --> 14:36.920
I'd say, give her the benefit
of the doubt. For now.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.720
Tie her off.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.440
Never trust a dirty cop.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.920
Once they're bent,
they just keep bending.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.000
Donny Boy?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.160
Er...

14:53.520 --> 14:56.320
One  thing, maybe, but two?

14:56.320 --> 14:58.240
Nah.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.640
I'm with Bulgey.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.240
Well...

15:04.240 --> 15:08.160
..if you're really not sure you
can trust her, then test her.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.840
Give her a job.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.320
If she doesn't do it...

15:16.760 --> 15:18.840
CERI:  I didn't know if
he was going to lamp me or

15:18.840 --> 15:20.720
fall sobbing into my arms.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.840
I don't think he knew either,
so he just stomped off.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.480
Suppose it's me own fault for being
such a positive male role model.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.320
Hello? You listening?

15:37.320 --> 15:38.880
Sorry, sorry.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.240
Er, what you going to do?

15:41.240 --> 15:44.160
Well, I'll see if he
turns up tomorrow.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.160
His work's actually all right.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.960
How's the business going?

15:47.960 --> 15:50.520
Without the stake in the yard,
I mean.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.960
What, the legit part, you mean?
Hmm.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.000
Steady-ish.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.360
Why'd you ask?

16:03.040 --> 16:05.440
Uh-oh.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.040
It's worthy of a pause.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.040
Hey. It's OK.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.680
Whatever it is, it's OK.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.000
Er...

16:23.000 --> 16:25.040
..I'm not sure I can do it any more.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.480
Do what?

16:32.720 --> 16:35.760
Who, Col? What's he asked you to do?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.800
No, no, no, it's not him. It's me.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.520
After Owen...

16:40.520 --> 16:43.200
..everything just feels
different, y'know?

16:43.200 --> 16:47.000
And...I'm not sure I can
keep doing it. No.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.880
I know I can't.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.640
Well, can you just stop?

16:56.520 --> 16:59.600
No, I can't, I can't just
tell him that we're done.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.440
What if in six months' time,
I have to arrest one of his?

17:02.440 --> 17:05.320
Then what? I have to resign.

17:05.320 --> 17:08.480
But if I'm not a copper any more,
then I'm no use to him.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.240
Resign? It's your whole life, love.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.440
The only thing you've
ever wanted to do.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.320
I know, I know that.

17:15.320 --> 17:18.720
Would we manage, though?
Without his money, I mean?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.480
The stake in the yard?

17:22.680 --> 17:24.960
Well, we might be able to
cover the mortgage.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.200
But the Martengrove fees...

17:27.200 --> 17:29.480
Owen'd have to go back
to the old place.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.320
No. Oh, God, no, absolutely not.
We'd have no choice.  No, no!

17:32.320 --> 17:34.520
Well, there's the stash in the loft.
That'd cover it.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.880
They don't take cash.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.600
Well, it's only another two years,
and if he's still in the chair,

17:38.600 --> 17:41.040
we could get a grant.  Maybe.
Maybe, I don't know.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.360
Maybe. Who's giving us a grant
for Mauritius next year, though?

17:44.360 --> 17:47.040
What has Mauritius got that
Scarborough hasn't?

17:52.720 --> 17:55.680
You know, for once in our marriage,
it'd be nice to know what you

17:55.680 --> 17:58.200
were going to say
before you actually said it.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.000
We'd be broke.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.480
But we'd be free.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.840
I need to say summat.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.600
Is this going to spoil me porridge?

18:43.600 --> 18:45.520
Owen's coming home later.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.440
And, er, he's going to need me.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.920
And...

18:51.880 --> 18:55.560
Ah, bloody hell, I'm thinking
about hanging it up, San.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.200
Are you, bollocks?!

18:57.200 --> 18:58.640
I'm sorry.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.640
I'm re-evaluating my life
and what's important,

19:02.640 --> 19:04.320
and I need to focus on me son.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.160
Yeah, and we'll help you with that.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.960
Reduced hours, whatever you need.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.920
Yeah, but I need to be really there.

19:09.920 --> 19:13.080
Not there with my brain
on me desk here.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.360
I've made me mind up.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.360
Lou. Owen nearly died.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.960
The second you're back at work,

19:18.960 --> 19:21.280
you're in a hostage situation
where a shot's fired.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.440
I don't think you're ready
to make this decision yet.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.080
You're also the best officer
I've got, I can't afford to lose ya.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.160
I won't get the funding
to replace ya.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.360
It'll be Cowper that
has to fill your shoes,

19:30.360 --> 19:31.640
he can barely fill his own.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.520
Don't repeat that.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.120
Just don't write the letter yet.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.400
I won't accept it.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.240
I was bringing you in to get
your take on putting together

19:40.240 --> 19:42.400
a task force, to have a
crack at McHugh.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.400
The lab have pulled a late print
from the Thomas Ajazi crime scene.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.160
From someone linked to McHugh?

19:48.160 --> 19:49.800
Mm. Harrison Sprewell.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.600
Entry-level scrote in the crew.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.080
Flew to Spain on an impromptu
holiday the morning

19:54.080 --> 19:55.760
AFTER the murder.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.400
So, Sprewell kills Ajazi in a spat
with Endri Marku's crew,

19:59.400 --> 20:02.640
McHugh puts him on a plane,
gun gets passed to Wilkes.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.400
Sounds plausible.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.480
Best we've had on 'em in years.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.440
Enough to have a run at
the man himself.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.440
Christ! Do you know what,
you're dismissed.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.200
Ma'am.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.920
For fuck's sake.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.320
DOOR SHUTS

21:06.280 --> 21:07.840
Thanks for meeting me.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.960
About yesterday, I'm sorry.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.600
I didn't know about the raid until
it was...  Let's forget about that.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.960
Ever find yourself looking back?

21:17.960 --> 21:20.480
You know, pining for
those old times?

21:21.800 --> 21:24.360
Just you and me.
Remember all that?

21:25.600 --> 21:29.960
Two black sheep just hustling,

21:29.960 --> 21:33.400
shinnying up that greasy pole,
just...

21:33.400 --> 21:36.080
..striving, getting one
over on the bastards,

21:36.080 --> 21:38.600
I fucking love all that.
Miss that.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.760
Now you could say we've made it,
but the truth of it is...

21:46.520 --> 21:49.680
..it's just more difficult
to keep hold of it all, isn't it?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.880
You lose things.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.160
You've lost more than I have.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.840
Come on, I've got coffee.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.520
I'm glad we're doing this,

22:09.520 --> 22:12.360
because there's something
I need to ask you, too.  OK.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.720
Ladies first.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.000
I just need a wee favour.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.760
Trying to do an exchange
with somebody.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.520
Should be a very simple handover,

22:22.520 --> 22:24.240
but she's getting a wee bit jumpy,
y'know?

22:24.240 --> 22:26.200
Sent one of the boys
first-time round,

22:26.200 --> 22:27.680
but she bailed at the sight of him.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.520
So, now she wants to do the switch
in public, with a woman.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.320
And I'm the only woman you know,
is that right, Col?

22:36.320 --> 22:39.440
How about Elise?  I need a grown-up.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.520
Look, I know it's beneath you,
but...

22:41.520 --> 22:43.960
Say "no" if you're not
comfortable, y'know?

22:51.880 --> 22:54.240
What would I be delivering?
Just cash.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.840
In return, she'll give you
a wee bit of envelope,

22:58.840 --> 23:01.520
with a bit of paperwork
that I need inside.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.960
That's it, it's all pretty simple,
pretty easy, y'know...

23:03.960 --> 23:06.520
Why's it all wrapped up like that?
She asked for it.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.000
I don't know.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.320
Maybe she wants to keep it in her
fucking fish tank or, I don't know.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.560
Is everything all right, Col?
Mm-hm.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.480
Look, if you don't want to do it,
just say.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.160
I would, but the boy's
coming home later, and...

23:33.160 --> 23:34.400
Fuck, is that today?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.360
Ah, Jesus, all right.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.280
Forget it, forget it. I...

23:40.960 --> 23:42.720
It's fine, I'll find someone else.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.720
What was it you wanted to say?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.480
Er, just wanted to warn you
about your other grows,

23:52.480 --> 23:55.280
cos NPAS are going to come up
tomorrow with the infrareds,

23:55.280 --> 23:57.680
and they'll spot them a mile off.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.080
OK.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.400
You sure?  Yes.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.200
OK.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.160
Leeds Station, red scarf,
platform 12, 5pm.  OK.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.160
Take care of him.  See ya.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.000
All good?  All good.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.120
OK.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.320
Home sweet home.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.840
I can walk in.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.200
Kiwi.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.960
I was going to put
a party hat on her,

25:43.960 --> 25:45.920
but she'd probably just
have eaten it.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.960
What do you think to these, eh?
Bit easier?

25:52.960 --> 25:55.360
Also in your bathroom,
I've put some dispensable ones...

25:55.360 --> 25:58.160
Can I just check myself?  Yeah.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.640
HE STRAINS

27:37.160 --> 27:38.960
Why'd you leave that light on?

27:40.760 --> 27:43.240
So it's like she's still here.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.600
But she's not.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.040
Yes, I know that.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.560
Are you all right?

28:17.400 --> 28:20.800
Any luck with Jade Wilkes?
Sorry, no answer at her address.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.360
Neighbour's not seen her.
I can keep trying?  Yeah.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.880
PHONE RINGS

28:26.240 --> 28:29.040
Est. Tell me you've found
Col McHugh's driving licence

28:29.040 --> 28:30.680
in a bag of potting soil.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.040
ESTHER:  You should get over here.
Now.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.200
First sweep didn't turn up much.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.800
Couldn't get it open ourselves.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.680
PC Morgan noticed a leak running out
from inside the wall there.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.880
It's urine.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.760
Torches, people, come on!

29:13.200 --> 29:15.880
The translator said they heard us
come in yesterday.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.320
And just about managed
to get down to the cellar,

29:18.320 --> 29:20.160
squeeze into that hole.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.680
Like they'd been taught.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.280
No food, no water.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.280
No way to get themselves out.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.320
God, they're younger than Owen.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.760
Do they know who they're
working for?  No.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.280
They only saw the trafficker.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.960
The lad were brought here
to tend the crop.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.400
We don't know what
the girl's been doing.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.360
Hopefully just cooking and cleaning.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.000
I thought McHugh didn't use kids.
Yeah, I thought so, too.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.040
Yeah?

32:10.040 --> 32:13.720
DONAL:  She turned up,
but ran off before making the drop.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.320
Like she got spooked or summat.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.840
Well, look, um...

32:18.840 --> 32:21.360
..I'm going to need you
to do something for me.

32:21.360 --> 32:24.280
Something important,
and not very nice.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.680
Why can't he just talk to us?

32:38.680 --> 32:42.440
Yeah, cos teenagers love talking to
their parents about their feelings.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.600
I know I did.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.200
I just, I really don't like
the idea of outsourcing our son's

32:47.200 --> 32:49.920
mental health to some bead necklace
and a dozen fuckups sitting in

32:49.920 --> 32:53.200
a circle, for God's sake.
It's not about us, is it?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.720
He needs someone else to talk to.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.600
Someone that's got
no skin in the game.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.400
Loads of people, over the years.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.760
Do you remember me, Vernon?
We've met before,

34:41.760 --> 34:44.680
at various do's, years ago,
I'm Bill Slack's daughter...

34:44.680 --> 34:47.840
Your father's mouthy teenage

35:03.440 --> 35:07.240
You must have been what, 14? 15?

35:07.240 --> 35:09.240
Made quite the impression.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.520
Perv.  No, not like that!

35:11.520 --> 35:13.480
Because you were so like your dad.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.320
It were obvious you were going
to follow him in.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.520
And, lo and behold, here you are.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.600
From my old mates in Bradford nick.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.360
They've mellowed in their old age.

35:27.360 --> 35:30.760
Their little notes used
to come wrapped round a brick.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.160
Why'd you keep it?

35:33.240 --> 35:35.960
Nice to know somebody out
there's thinking about you.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.000
How's your mam? I liked her.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.880
She's all right, I think.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.240
Your dad never seemed
right for her.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.880
She were never right for me dad.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.040
So...?

35:51.040 --> 35:54.040
I've come to talk about you, Vernon.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.680
You were for sale almost
your whole career.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.400
You took money and gifts
from whoever'd offer,

35:59.400 --> 36:03.640
in exchange for tip-offs
and lost evidence.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.720
But in '97, you confessed.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.640
To me dad, among others,
out the blue.

36:09.640 --> 36:13.320
I wanted to know,
why the sudden change of heart?

36:13.320 --> 36:15.200
You writing a book, or summat?

36:16.560 --> 36:18.040
Just interested.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.280
Nah.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.320
If I'm under no obligation,
I want to know why you're asking.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.160
An officer in me unit
is taking bribes.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.640
I wanted to know the mind-set
before I make a move.

36:38.960 --> 36:42.600
If it doesn't sound too crass,
what's in it for me?

36:45.920 --> 36:47.280
HE SCOFFS

36:48.560 --> 36:52.720
You think you can buy all
my darkest secrets for 40 quid?

36:52.720 --> 36:54.440
Give over.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.600
There's a stack of unpaid bills
and letters from the council in the

36:57.600 --> 37:00.240
corner, they never write with
good news. The red wine you drink

37:00.240 --> 37:02.720
is the cheapest corner shop dog piss
three quid can buy,

37:02.720 --> 37:05.320
and I saw the state of your fridge
when you went for the milk.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.520
You'd have taken 20.  Ooh!

37:07.520 --> 37:08.880
You're not very nice.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.320
CAT MEOWS Here she is.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.840
The offending article.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.000
Oh, God! Is it all right?

37:17.000 --> 37:20.360
Far from it,
her kidneys are packing up.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.000
Oh, shit!

37:22.000 --> 37:23.400
Give it here.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.600
Well?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.960
The last thing the brass ever want

37:36.960 --> 37:39.920
is the embarrassment of a
big corruption case.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.720
They almost always go for
a quiet dismissal,

37:42.720 --> 37:44.600
rather than a prosecution.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.480
Thus has it always been,
thus shall it ever be.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.640
So there I am, back in '97,

37:50.640 --> 37:53.960
not even under formal
investigation yet,

37:53.960 --> 37:55.520
but it were coming.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.040
Everyone knew.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.760
HE CHUCKLES
I hadn't exactly been careful.

38:00.760 --> 38:06.000
We had my ex-wife's 30th in one of
Tommy Dugan's clubs, for God's sake.

38:07.920 --> 38:12.480
So, I thought I'd get out
ahead of it. Take control.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.440
Get some credit by coming forward.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.880
I went to see 'em, I cut a deal.

38:16.880 --> 38:20.320
I'd cop to a carefully-curated
selection of misdemeanours,

38:20.320 --> 38:22.000
but leave out the worst stuff.

38:23.560 --> 38:28.080
I avoid doing time, they limit
their reputational damage,

38:28.080 --> 38:32.000
and everyone's happy -
well, equally miserable.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.920
Nice job.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.280
You look disappointed.

38:43.760 --> 38:49.160
Were you hoping for the, er,
moving story of how I saw the light?

38:49.160 --> 38:51.840
Me dad said you begged him
for forgiveness.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.440
Did he? Oh, well,
that's classic Bill Slack, that.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.480
What's does that mean?
Oh, I don't like to speak ill.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.640
What ill could you possibly speak
about my dad? He were a legend.

39:03.640 --> 39:07.520
Legends are seldom universally
beloved in their own lifetimes.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.400
He solved Sowerby.

39:09.400 --> 39:14.320
Sowerby was solved by the four WPCs

39:14.320 --> 39:18.120
that visited every shoe shop in the
north of England to find out

39:18.120 --> 39:20.280
where the lad got his Chelsea boots.

39:20.280 --> 39:23.760
Then your old man sauntered
in front of the nearest camera,

39:23.760 --> 39:27.240
looking like David Cassidy,
and hoovered up all the garlands.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.960
As per! His only real talent
were for taking credit.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.480
He got the killer to talk.
Five hours, it took.

39:33.480 --> 39:36.560
He were ready to blab before
he'd finished his brew!

39:38.040 --> 39:41.000
But there weren't much glory in
a five-minute confession,

39:41.000 --> 39:42.920
not for Beautiful Bill Slack.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.560
Five hours, on the other hand...

39:44.560 --> 39:47.600
Joke at the time was, he had him
reciting his times tables.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.920
Sounds like sour grapes
to me, Vernon.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.680
Oh, you believe what you like, love.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.120
Thanks for the tea.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.120
What? Er, is that it?

39:56.120 --> 39:58.280
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

40:27.920 --> 40:30.440
Owen? Come on, are you ready?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.360
What're you doing?

40:37.360 --> 40:39.040
You liked my dad, didn't ya?

40:40.760 --> 40:42.160
HE SCOFFS

40:42.160 --> 40:44.040
Well, he was good to us, right?

40:45.760 --> 40:49.120
Yeah, yeah, he helped us with
the first flat, didn't he?  Mm-hm.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.520
He never let me forget it, mind.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.680
Do you think I take after him?

40:57.680 --> 40:59.800
A bit, yeah.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.320
Chair?  Yeah. It's a bit far.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.120
Hey. You're going to smash it.

41:21.120 --> 41:24.000
Yeah, I don't think you're supposed
to "smash" the support group.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.400
I'm all right from here.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.480
No, you sure?
I'll just take you inside...

41:38.480 --> 41:40.600
We'll just meet you here
when you're done.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.840
My name's Owen.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.120
Three weeks ago, I got sick.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.920
Meningitis.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.040
Almost died, and, well...

41:59.040 --> 42:00.960
WRY CHUCKLE

42:00.960 --> 42:02.720
I guess that's my trauma.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.080
ALL: Hi, Owen.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.080
I'm Shaheen.
It's not my first time here.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.680
ALL: Hi, Shaheen.

42:08.680 --> 42:12.040
I got diagnosed with PTSD
three years ago.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.560
Welcome back.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.040
All right. I'm John.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.200
I'm a train driver.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.640
And I'm here because I hit someone.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.560
On the tracks.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.360
ALL: Hi, John.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.000
Do I have to say summat?

42:33.520 --> 42:36.800
No. But it might feel good to.

42:40.160 --> 42:43.280
Right, well, erm...

42:43.280 --> 42:44.720
I'm James.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.280
First time here.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.840
I guess...

42:50.840 --> 42:53.920
..you know, someone I love...

42:57.320 --> 42:58.680
..died.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.560
And that's why I'm here.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.040
ALL: Hi, James.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.360
Thanks, James.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.400
Hi, I'm Gayle.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.040
And I was in the Army.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.040
CERI:  He's fine.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.560
Oi? This is good.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.960
Yeah, No, I know. It's not that.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.120
What is it, then?

43:25.120 --> 43:27.560
Just a scrambled head, that's all.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.200
Owen, Col, quitting...

43:29.200 --> 43:32.560
Look, this is going to be really
good for us. I know it.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.480
Yeah, me, too.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.920
Just all the secrets.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.080
Sometimes I just...
want to go into Sandy's office

43:39.080 --> 43:40.960
and tell her everything.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.320
What?

43:44.080 --> 43:46.640
What?

43:46.640 --> 43:48.560
You talking about confessing?

43:48.560 --> 43:50.760
No, not talking about owt.
I'm just saying...

43:50.760 --> 43:53.040
No, no, no,
you don't just say things.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.000
I know you. There's always an angle.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.520
You're testing the water.
This is what you do.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.560
What you on about?

43:58.560 --> 44:01.280
When there's something going on up
here that you think I won't like,

44:01.280 --> 44:04.080
you run it past me first,
real casual-like.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.640
You actually considering this?

44:05.640 --> 44:08.520
No, no! It just,
it weighs heavy sometimes.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.640
That's fair, in't it?  No.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.680
It's not fucking fair.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.240
What does that mean?

44:14.240 --> 44:16.840
You gave up your right to
a clear conscience when you first

44:16.840 --> 44:19.560
started taking his money.
You made your bed years ago.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.680
Yeah, and you got in it with me.
Yeah, I did.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.800
And that makes me
a bottle-job shithouse.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.120
And maybe it is too late for me
to start standing up to you,

44:26.120 --> 44:28.240
but here I am.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.720
You've got a son back there
who needs you now more than ever.

44:30.720 --> 44:33.160
That you're even considering this...

44:33.160 --> 44:34.880
You could do real time!  Look...

44:34.880 --> 44:37.600
It's madness!  They're not going
to prosecute, Ceri...

44:37.600 --> 44:40.720
What, you want to take that risk,
do you? What about Col, eh?

44:40.720 --> 44:42.840
I know you think
he's your friend, Lou,

44:42.840 --> 44:46.960
but he's also a fucking drug-dealer!
He'd come after ya, he'd come after
us!

44:46.960 --> 44:48.880
Can you not see
how selfish this is?

44:50.880 --> 44:52.720
Yeah, but you are selfish, yeah?

44:52.720 --> 44:55.920
You know that, it's fine, that's
who you are, it's part of you.

44:55.920 --> 44:57.800
It's what makes you strong. But
this...

45:21.800 --> 45:24.280
DONAL:  Do you want a brew?
Oh, no, thanks.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.960
I've no way of carrying it through.
I'll do you half.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.600
I'll carry it so you don't spill.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.960
I hope your girlfriend's
picking up the slack.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.760
On the wanking front. HE LAUGHS

45:35.760 --> 45:38.400
Erm...no, not at t'moment.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.040
Live with your parents?  Yeah.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.920
How've they taken all this?

45:44.680 --> 45:48.440
Me dad screwed handle on everything
in the house that moves.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.280
That's his way of
talking to me about it.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.720
Me mum...

45:54.440 --> 45:55.840
..I don't know.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.560
Sugar?  No, thanks.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.280
Oh, nice and strong, too, please.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.800
OK, mate.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.360
Big Boy's Massage Parlour!

46:30.680 --> 46:32.400
Y'all right, Noel?

46:32.400 --> 46:33.720
Slack!

46:33.720 --> 46:36.680
Is this you calling to say
it's a case of mistaken identity?

46:36.680 --> 46:38.760
Cos you know I want my compo.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.040
Oh, no, afraid I'm just checking in.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.400
How'd you mean?  You doing OK?

46:43.400 --> 46:45.400
Head down, nose clean, all that?

46:45.400 --> 46:48.400
HE CHUCKLES You know that's not like me.

46:48.400 --> 46:51.600
I'm already running gaff, aren't I?
Got to show 'em who's top dog.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.240
Speaking of which, how is she?

46:53.240 --> 46:54.760
Who?  Kiwi.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.640
You've taken her to the pound,
ain't ya?  What, no.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.880
I promised I wouldn't.
She's living with me.

47:00.880 --> 47:04.240
Don't lie to me.  No, I swear down.
Me son loves her.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.320
Tell me this, though, how come
she shits more than she eats?

47:07.320 --> 47:09.280
HE LAUGHS

47:09.280 --> 47:11.640
You can't feed her
that cheap supermarket crap.

47:11.640 --> 47:14.200
Order online.  OK.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.880
Look, I know you probably
haven't got a court date yet,

47:16.880 --> 47:18.840
but don't waste your remand time,
OK?

47:18.840 --> 47:22.400
Find out what courses they've got.
Programmes. Training.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.360
Get your head set now.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.920
You're in there for a while.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.440
Well, don't want you
to miss the cheese course.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.360
But I do want to ask you summat.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.240
Yeah, I knew you weren't just
calling to see how I were.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.120
It's about your cousin, Jade.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.400
I want to check she's OK,
but I can't seem to track her down.

47:42.400 --> 47:45.120
Yeah, yeah, she's not
going to be at home.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.200
She's minding our nan's flat
while she's in Jamaica.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.480
Lovell Green.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.600
Bedford House, number 46.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.960
Tell her I said sorry, yeah?
I were bang out of order.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.160
OK. I will, I promise.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.520
You take care, Noel.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.840
United front, OK?

48:25.680 --> 48:28.680
Thank you.  Hiya.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.080
How was it?  Fine. Good, actually.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.400
I blamed everything
on my domineering mother

48:34.400 --> 48:36.200
and emotionally repressed father.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.680
That's my boy.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.120
Don't be shy, Dad, I'm knackered.
Come on, then.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.640
MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYS

49:21.200 --> 49:23.000
Jade!

49:23.000 --> 49:24.400
Jade, are you in there?

49:52.080 --> 49:53.760
Jade?

49:56.600 --> 49:58.440
Jade?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.360
Jade?

50:08.040 --> 50:10.520
Jade? Jade!

50:12.040 --> 50:13.640
You're OK, you're OK, you're OK.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.920
You're OK, you're OK. Help's coming.

50:19.920 --> 50:22.560
ON PHONE:  Emergency, which service
do you require?  Ambulance.

50:38.080 --> 50:40.760
DI Slack?  Yeah?

50:40.760 --> 50:44.080
There'll be extensive scarring,
but she'll be OK.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.440
She's lucky.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.840
Everyone's so fucking lucky,
aren't they?!

50:54.400 --> 50:56.800
Sorry. I'm sorry.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.560
Please, can I see her?

51:12.560 --> 51:14.920
Hello, Jade.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.920
I'm Detective Inspector
Louisa Slack.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.320
Do you remember me?

51:21.160 --> 51:22.920
I spoke to Noel.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.280
He wanted me to tell you
how sorry he is.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.920
So am I. I'm so sorry
someone did this to you.

51:28.920 --> 51:32.480
But I'm going to find them.
I promise.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.800
You just need to
tell me what happened.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.560
I fell.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.960
To Lou.

52:00.440 --> 52:04.320
All right? For your stuff,
and a clean trackie.

52:04.320 --> 52:06.880
Ta.  I'll just wait out front, yeah?

52:21.760 --> 52:24.000
BULGEY ON PHONE:
She's still not responding.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.440
What do you want to do?

52:28.200 --> 52:29.240
KNOCK ON DOOR

52:37.600 --> 52:38.960
What happened to you?

52:38.960 --> 52:41.680
If you had your time again,
would you confess?

52:41.680 --> 52:44.000
Well, I...it kept me out of prison.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.320
But everything comes at a price.

52:46.320 --> 52:48.520
What price?

52:48.520 --> 52:51.000
Off the top of me head,
one career, one house,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.800
couple of dozen pals, one wife
and one daughter, give or take.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.160
Whose blood is that?

52:57.160 --> 52:59.400
But there must've been
a part of you that was sorry.

52:59.400 --> 53:01.520
That wanted to make things right.

53:01.520 --> 53:04.440
No-one does something like
that out of selfishness.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.680
All confession is selfish.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.120
We confess to unburden ourselves.

53:12.440 --> 53:15.160
To get shot of something
we don't want to carry any more.

53:15.160 --> 53:17.840
What's not selfish about that?

53:17.840 --> 53:21.080
Seems to me it's more noble
to carry it the distance, alone.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.040
This officer you're after...

53:27.800 --> 53:30.200
..she's in deep doo-doo, ain't she?

53:33.360 --> 53:35.720
Now, you wait! I can help.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.080
Let me help.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.800
So, how did you get into this mess?

53:48.640 --> 53:51.800
He started off as me informant.

53:51.800 --> 53:54.560
I were in me first year.
Struggling.

53:54.560 --> 53:59.600
Fucked up. Me and my mates got hurt
trying to impress the brass.

54:01.160 --> 54:03.440
I needed a win.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.080
Col gave me plenty.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.760
I built me career off
the back of his information.

54:11.720 --> 54:15.120
But then, he started
to ask for little favours,

54:15.120 --> 54:17.560
turn a blind eye to what
he were doing -

54:17.560 --> 54:21.960
and in return, he'd give me
something bigger.

54:21.960 --> 54:24.240
Someone worse.

54:24.240 --> 54:26.120
Were always a fair exchange.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.600
We got close.

54:30.600 --> 54:35.040
It were just us two against
the world, sort of thing.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.000
Money didn't even come into it.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.600
Then a few years later...

54:41.600 --> 54:44.880
..me husband's business
went down the shitter.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.960
We were nearly bankrupt.

54:48.960 --> 54:52.280
And Col bailed us out.

54:52.280 --> 54:54.880
Made me husband a partner
in the builder's merchant

54:54.880 --> 54:56.440
he launders money through.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.960
Set us up with an income.

54:59.920 --> 55:02.160
SHE SIGHS

55:02.160 --> 55:04.200
And your fella was OK with this?

55:05.440 --> 55:07.280
Didn't really give him much choice.

55:09.280 --> 55:13.920
So, when McHugh's money
started flowing through,

55:13.920 --> 55:16.320
you found you couldn't
say "no" any more?

55:16.320 --> 55:18.600
Mm, it's not that simple.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.280
We cared about each other.

55:23.680 --> 55:27.600
The intel he gave me,
I did good with it, I think.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.640
I were able to tell myself,
I was still a good copper.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.960
Well, we tell ourselves
what we need to,

55:32.960 --> 55:35.160
so we can keep on doing
what we want to.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.480
But now, you want to stop.

55:39.480 --> 55:41.160
I don't know what I want.

55:41.160 --> 55:43.760
Well, you don't want to go
and tell the whole story to someone

55:43.760 --> 55:46.320
with very little money
and less character.

55:46.320 --> 55:49.040
What's to stop me selling
this information to McHugh?

55:49.040 --> 55:51.720
Oh, careful, Vernon,

55:51.720 --> 55:54.520
I've never met a more ideal
murder victim.

55:55.840 --> 55:59.840
It'd just be a wet black stain
on that armchair when they find ya.

56:04.720 --> 56:07.640
So, tell him your lad needs you.
You need to scale back.

56:07.640 --> 56:10.680
If you really are pals,
he'll understand.

56:10.680 --> 56:14.400
I can't do owt for him ever again.

56:16.360 --> 56:18.520
I don't have a decent explanation,

56:18.520 --> 56:21.840
but after me son, I just...

56:21.840 --> 56:25.280
"They that were with me saw indeed
the light, and were afraid,

56:25.280 --> 56:28.920
"but they heard not the voice
of Him that spake to me."

56:28.920 --> 56:30.880
Didn't have you down
as a God-botherer.

56:30.880 --> 56:32.760
I don't like to bother him.

56:32.760 --> 56:35.200
It's an underrated read,
though, the Bible.

56:36.440 --> 56:41.120
I like God's character development
from the Old Testament to the New.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.360
So, quit the force.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.560
That's what I were going to do.
But then...

56:47.560 --> 56:51.040
..I'm just running away, and he gets
to stays exactly where he is.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.760
Where you put him.

56:52.760 --> 56:56.800
Folk often ask how he arrived
from nowhere to take over

56:56.800 --> 56:58.640
the whole O'Brien firm.

56:58.640 --> 57:01.760
How he rose so fast,
stayed ahead of Plod.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.200
Now we know.

57:03.200 --> 57:06.680
No, you can't put all that on me,
Vernon.  Not all of it, no.

57:06.680 --> 57:08.920
But would he be where
he is today without you?

57:14.200 --> 57:16.240
There's only one way out.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.000
He's got to go down.
