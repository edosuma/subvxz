00:00.601 --> 00:01.602
<i>Previously...</i>

00:01.735 --> 00:02.770
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

00:02.903 --> 00:04.805
Fine. You win.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.374
Take him. Go.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.676
<i>Well, Javier seems to have</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:10.811
a spring in his step today too.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.613
Okay--smiles.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.148
I love you.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.950
But we have friend energy.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.419
Only child of a single mom.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.488
Carrying my own bag
since I was five.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.491
I was conceived in the middle
of a hurricane.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.059
<i>Hurricane Helene.</i>

00:25.193 --> 00:27.195
You're gonna be okay.

00:27.328 --> 00:31.765
My fantasy is to find
my biological father.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.234
He's not even looking for me.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.203
I mean, what if he doesn't
even care that I...I exist?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.238
<i>This is gonna sound crazy,</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:39.873
<i>but I think I'm your daughter.</i>

00:40.007 --> 00:42.076
I was in the jungle there
in Hurricane Helene.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.412
This way, I found shelter.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.486
<i>Gina just... found me.</i>

00:52.620 --> 00:54.355
Isla.
- Hi.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.791
<i>I have never seen
Elenita happier.</i>

00:57.925 --> 01:00.194
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes, I do.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.111
Oh, and I thought maybe
Helene would be here,

01:17.245 --> 01:18.512
meet her dad at the plane.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.315
She's not one
for being up this early.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.084
We can't tell if it's part
of mourning her mother

01:24.218 --> 01:25.919
or it's just who she is.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.055
Mm. Well, I'm sure
it's just temporary.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.658
Wait a minute.
You said "we."

01:30.791 --> 01:31.959
- Did I?
- Yes.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.861
We, we, we all the way home--

01:33.994 --> 01:37.131
- Are you almost done?
- Probably not.

01:37.265 --> 01:41.869
Oh, it's just I would love
to see you two get serious.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.939
Oh, wait.
What's that I hear?

01:46.073 --> 01:48.041
Don't say wedding bells. Please.

01:48.176 --> 01:52.213
It's that I was happy
with Mel for 50 years.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.847
Marriage is a blessing.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.387
Ugh, just kill me now!

01:59.520 --> 02:01.722
Ah, they're both window
seats, Dolly.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.157
It's all window seats.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.558
You took the one on the left

02:04.692 --> 02:06.227
so that I would have to
look straight into the sun.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.395
I didn't do the
calculations, Dolly,

02:07.528 --> 02:10.531
What calculations?
It's the sun!

02:10.664 --> 02:12.400
You're familiar
with its movements.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.535
Now she thinks
I'm colluding with the sun.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.638
I present to you
Dutch and Dolly Paymer,

02:17.771 --> 02:20.541
here to celebrate
their anniversary.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.210
Oh.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.360
Welcome to Fantasy Island,
and happy anniversary, huh?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.262
34 years!
- It only feels like 70.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.431
He thinks it doesn't count
if he mumbles it.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.600
And now you're empty nesters.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.669
And we're looking at
the next 34

02:48.802 --> 02:53.073
stretching out in front of us
like a long and mumbling road.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.908
And he's either at work,
or lately,

02:55.042 --> 02:57.545
he's been at the gym
all the time,

02:57.678 --> 02:59.280
which is very suspicious.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.383
And does he talk to me? No.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.586
Well, maybe you could put
a little retail therapy on it.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.259
Our wedding. 18 years old.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.694
We knew each other three weeks
when we got engaged.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.796
Marry in haste,
repent in leisure.

03:15.929 --> 03:16.997
Dutch!

03:17.130 --> 03:18.399
You disagree?

03:18.532 --> 03:21.435
No, I-I agree.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.804
I just--I don't like
when he says it.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.309
Hmm. So tell me, what can
the Island do for you?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.478
Our fantasy is to know

03:30.611 --> 03:32.946
if we should spend
our golden years together.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.284
Or if they'd be
more golden apart.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.018
I mean, it could go either way.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.853
We both had parents
who were divorced

03:39.987 --> 03:42.423
and they were miserable,
so we want to know.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.158
Look at you sweet babies.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.795
So young...[chuckles].
Then kids in the house.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.563
Maybe you could use
your time here

03:49.697 --> 03:51.098
getting to know
each other again.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.133
Ha. We know... each other.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.135
No, I know
every thought, sound,

03:55.269 --> 03:57.505
and smell this man can make.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.507
Well, sometimes we see

03:59.640 --> 04:02.810
and we smell...

04:02.943 --> 04:04.177
what we expect.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.746
I read once
that every marriage

04:05.879 --> 04:07.315
has six people in it

04:07.448 --> 04:09.283
because each person is
who they think they are,

04:09.417 --> 04:11.184
who the other person
thinks they are,

04:11.319 --> 04:12.653
and who they really are.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.689
Well, you don't want
six of us here.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.825
I tend to agree.
This office isn't big enough.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.094
- The Island isn't big enough.
- The Island isn't big enough.

04:21.228 --> 04:24.965
Ah. Maybe you are more
in sync than you thought.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.335
Right? Let's get started.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.603
You'll be shown to your suites
right away.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.839
- Um... suites?
- Correct.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.107
I guess separate
suites make sense. Ha.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.876
I don't know
if I'll be able to sleep.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.611
Really?

04:37.745 --> 04:38.912
Can somebody bring me
some chunks of ice

04:39.046 --> 04:40.814
in the shape of her feet
to really...

04:40.948 --> 04:42.249
- Stop!
- Make me feel home.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.551
- Just stop!
- Please.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.619
Unbelievable! I don't know--
if you're gonna

04:45.753 --> 04:47.154
behave like that...
- It was just a joke.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.456
Why are we even coming here?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.057
Just don't talk to me.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.693
You think they want
their picture back?

05:01.435 --> 05:04.738
Hey, I got you something
on the mainland.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.341
Is it a car?

05:07.475 --> 05:10.177
Uh... it's a flamingo.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.051
You know what, I-I thought--

05:18.185 --> 05:19.653
but now I realize...
- No, you--

05:19.787 --> 05:22.055
- It's not exactly...
- You know what? It's cool.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.491
I'm gonna...

05:23.624 --> 05:25.192
I'm gonna name him Dave.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.028
It's a kid's gift. Sorry.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.263
I'm still trying to
work this...

05:30.398 --> 05:31.432
It's great... okay?

05:31.565 --> 05:33.934
I...I really like it.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.772
Thanks for coming by.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.141
Right.

05:41.274 --> 05:44.211
Hey, you maybe want to...
grab something to eat?

05:44.344 --> 05:47.280
Uh, yeah, sure.
Breakfast later sounds great.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.156
It's 2:00 p.m.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.630
Oh.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.566
Pretty.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.284
Hmm...

06:38.098 --> 06:40.267
Ahh...

06:40.400 --> 06:42.736
Mine, mine, mine.

06:50.978 --> 06:54.114
Not... picking those up.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.886
Heaven.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.128
Hello. I'm here to collect
your wedding ring.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.429
Oh, my ring?

07:09.563 --> 07:11.632
Mm-hmm.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.167
Okay.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.302
Ha.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.471
- Oh...
- I don't know if I can...

07:18.472 --> 07:19.673
Got it.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.944
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.314 --> 07:30.217
Oh, absolutely.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.520
Separate suites.
Separate lives--here you go.

07:32.653 --> 07:36.123
Am I sensing a "hall pass"
sort of situation?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.693
And the rings are off.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.196
Wow. Marriage goes poof
just like that.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.832
We'll see.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.668
People steer
their own futures, even here.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.706
Oh, speaking of futures,
I'll let you two just get to...

07:52.840 --> 07:55.976
Oh, hey no. Actually, Ruby,
I'd like to talk to you.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.923
Javier, I don't think anyone
knows how to be a parent.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.726
Yeah, but most people get
a starter model to warm up on.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.262
I got one that's fully
functional and hates me.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.064
Okay. She doesn't hate you.

08:17.197 --> 08:21.201
You just met, and she's still
trying to figure it all out.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.436
And on top of that, bless her,

08:23.571 --> 08:25.072
she's mourning her mother.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.741
And that's something
that I should be helping with.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.711
And a plushie
clearly wasn't the answer.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.083
I really wish I had
some better advice,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.285
but the truth is
someone her age

08:38.418 --> 08:41.589
just isn't gonna open up
right away to someone over 30.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.491
Not even you--you're just
gonna have to be patient.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.527
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.097
- Wait, what?
- You. You're not over 30.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.799
I mean,
not as far as she knows.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.901
Can you talk to her?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.604
I just wanna find out
what she needs me to be.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.309
Okay. You know what, for you,
I will do that.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.811
- All right.
- Yes.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.814
You know, I'm actually
picking up on the vibes, okay?

09:06.947 --> 09:09.349
I can text like the wind
and with emojis.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.951
I can do the winged eyeliner.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.653
- Very convincing.
- Really you think so?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.254
- Yeah, I do.
- Ha ha ha!

09:14.387 --> 09:17.457
Thank you!
I got this.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.961
<i>There's Goldman
doing a massive fake-out...</i>

09:21.094 --> 09:23.463
- 'Nother Zombie, sir?
- Oh, sure.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.865
I don't usually drink,

09:24.998 --> 09:26.800
but these tropical things
go down easy.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.670
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.705
I think I'd like something
with an umbrella.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.506
<i>Down the middle--oh!</i>

09:35.909 --> 09:38.712
Oh, my God.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.380
Are you okay?

09:42.883 --> 09:46.286
Oh... I'm sorry, ma'am.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.023
Ohh. Does anybody know
the drunk guy?

09:55.162 --> 09:56.864
- There you go.
- Oh, God.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.866
I just got a little dizzy.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.268
Oh, I'm familiar with
that kind of dizzy.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.704
This will help.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.775
Oh... ohh.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.811
Ahh... that feels good.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.447
I'm so embarrassed.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.484
Oh, we've all been embarrassed.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.920
I saw John Bon Jovi
on the street once,

10:20.053 --> 10:21.554
paparazzi all around him.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.356
So I took a big breath
and I yelled,

10:23.490 --> 10:26.426
"Hey, John Bon Jovi!"

10:26.559 --> 10:27.594
And my skirt fell down.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.863
Ha ha ha ha. No.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.198
To my ankles.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.902
Oh, that clip was on repeat
on "Talk Soup."

10:35.903 --> 10:38.171
- My name's Dutch.
- Dolly.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.740
Hello, Dolly.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.875
Ohh...
forget I said that.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.877
Everybody does it.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.951
And I'll just get this out upfront.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.354
Um... I have two grown kids,
recently divorced.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.123
That's why I'm here.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.892
Divorce recovery fantasy.
Ha ha. Same.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.494
I wonder what else
we have in common?

11:01.628 --> 11:05.398
Well, um... I'm anti-broccoli,
pro-science.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.434
Twitter before Instagram.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.702
Chunky over smooth.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.203
Best "SNL" cast.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.373
- Can't beat Gilda.
- Ah. Damn right.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.843
Wanna go for a walk?

11:15.976 --> 11:17.510
You think you can?

11:17.644 --> 11:19.880
Oh, ha, let's find out.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.323
So a stuffed flamingo?

11:30.457 --> 11:31.925
- Yeah, I know.
- Hmm.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.594
She's not seven, but I didn't
know her when she was seven.

11:34.728 --> 11:38.298
Maybe I just...
wanted that feeling.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.700
Oh, well, I think it was
a very nice gesture.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.971
No, look, I suspect that
she's going to treasure it.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.073
I suspect it's in a dumpster.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.411
- You know what's interesting?
- Hmm?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.513
Seeing you as a father.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.883
Ah, does it make me
seem older?

11:56.016 --> 11:58.218
And before you say anything,
the answer is no.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.453
Not older, but more mature.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.455
- Stop.
- In a good away.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.157
Okay--responsible.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.093
- Uh...
- Mmm...

12:06.226 --> 12:08.161
Come here.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.065
You seem like a good man.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.768
Someone to lean on,

12:14.902 --> 12:18.138
someone that is kind,

12:18.271 --> 12:20.173
someone with a loving heart.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.042
Okay. Better.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.312
- I kinda confess...
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.982
I don't think
I have ever been attracted

12:29.116 --> 12:30.951
to a dad-bod before.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.021
Whoa! Okay.
I do not have a dad-bod!

12:34.154 --> 12:35.122
You're right. Let me see.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.523
Prove it.
- Are you kidding me?

12:36.656 --> 12:38.025
- I'm not!
- Come here.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.660
Come here.
- Let me see that--oh!

12:40.794 --> 12:43.630
Oh yeah.
How about that?

12:46.466 --> 12:48.802
I'm right here for you, baby.

13:01.815 --> 13:05.552
<i>"And as the sun rose,
dripping from the sea,</i>

13:05.685 --> 13:08.688
<i>"the truth shown there
in front of me,</i>

13:08.822 --> 13:13.060
"that farther than
the sky from land

13:13.193 --> 13:16.263
is the gap between
two grains of sand."

13:16.396 --> 13:19.599
That's beautiful.
I can't believe you wrote that.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.572
It's supposed to be about how
sometimes the thing you want

13:25.705 --> 13:28.475
is closer than you realize.
- Right.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.743
And yet that doesn't
make it any easier to find.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.745
Exactly!

13:32.880 --> 13:34.882
Wow.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.050
I didn't know that was clear.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.419
Well, it's clear
because it's true.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.925
You know, difficult
doesn't mean impossible.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.395
And I think that we're just
as likely as young people

13:48.528 --> 13:51.064
to find that thing
that changes everything.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.735
Young people.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.406
They think that one person
can be everything.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.174
Well, maybe they could

14:01.308 --> 14:04.744
if they grow
and changed together.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.414
I mean, my ex and I...

14:07.547 --> 14:10.083
No change, no grow?

14:10.217 --> 14:13.987
Oh, we changed, but...
not together.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.890
Yeah.
We got to the point where

14:17.024 --> 14:21.461
I don't even think he saw me.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.632
And I so wanted to be seen.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.069
- Did you tell him that?
- Uh...

14:30.037 --> 14:32.239
Maybe if he'd ever listened,

14:32.372 --> 14:35.008
you know, if we'd been able
to talk like we're doing.

14:36.809 --> 14:40.247
I just was shouting into a void

14:40.380 --> 14:43.450
and the shouting--
that was a mistake on my side.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.985
Ah, I'm sure
you weren't shouting

14:45.118 --> 14:46.553
as loudly as you thought
you were.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.789
My ex--ha.
She's a shouter.

14:49.923 --> 14:52.825
It's the kind of person where
if you give her a necklace,

14:52.960 --> 14:55.295
she thinks that means you're
gonna strangle her with it.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.664
Which you definitely
never wanted to do?

14:57.797 --> 15:00.000
No, never.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.436
Ha ha. You know what?
That's the past--screw it.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.372
Tell me about the future.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.540
Well, in the near future,
I was thinking about

15:07.674 --> 15:10.343
sharing a cup of strong
black coffee with you.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.980
You keep reading my mind.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.183
Can we get something
unbearably sweet with it?

15:16.316 --> 15:18.952
I think
you're unbearably sweet.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.887
That was dumb.

15:21.021 --> 15:24.491
Was that dumb?
I mean, you're a poet.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.027
It's perfect.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.181
Hmm.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.883
Wednesday Addams
goes to the pool?

15:52.185 --> 15:54.554
Housekeeping kicked me
out of my room.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.958
So I decided to schlep it
down here and wait it out.

15:59.092 --> 16:03.363
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with a single schlep.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.373
Ms. Rourke,
we know what you did.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.242
There was no way
that we met by chance.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.044
I don't know how you did it,

16:17.177 --> 16:19.646
but somehow you managed
to pull off something

16:19.779 --> 16:22.215
that neither of us
could even dare to ask for.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.716
You found the perfect person
for each of us

16:23.850 --> 16:24.917
and brought us together.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.719
And guess what.
It worked.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.888
- We're getting married!
- We're getting married!

16:30.123 --> 16:31.758
How 'bout that?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.265
She's funny.
And we just click.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.566
I mean, when you know...

16:39.699 --> 16:40.767
You know.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.470
That keeps happening.

16:43.603 --> 16:44.737
She's free-spirited.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.673
She writes
the most beautiful poetry,

16:46.806 --> 16:49.076
and she can shake me
outta my routine.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.678
And he's so steady, but he's
also curious about the world

16:51.811 --> 16:53.613
and he knows things--

16:53.746 --> 16:55.648
acupuncture, architecture,

16:55.782 --> 16:57.250
alternative medicine.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.551
We didn't get past
the letter A.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.222
Dutch actually likes me.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.559
With my ex,

17:06.693 --> 17:09.028
I felt like
he just saw this monster.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.131
And then I started seeing it.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.267
- I don't see a monster.
- Ohh...

17:16.403 --> 17:17.904
I feel like I need
to point out

17:18.037 --> 17:21.808
that you got married to your
former spouses very quickly.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.611
I don't wanna see you
repeating any mistakes.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.146
We're not fools.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.847
We talked about
all the important stuff--

17:27.980 --> 17:29.682
religion, politics, moral core.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.119
Oh, he's got a moral core.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.321
But you see, uh,
big things are important,

17:34.454 --> 17:35.888
but small things matter too.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.790
Little resentments
that pile up.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.126
Oh, we'll work through
all those.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.460
That's easy.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.996
Well,
it certainly sounds like

17:44.131 --> 17:46.133
you know exactly what you want.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.368
And if there's anything
Fantasy Island knows how to do

17:48.501 --> 17:50.069
is throw a wedding.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.382
Thanks so much for helping.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.252
You know,
it's all been such a rush.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.320
Hey, it keeps my mind
off myself, so...

18:07.454 --> 18:09.256
Mm. Mm.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.062
You all right?
Seriously.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.398
It's been a lot lately.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.832
I know.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.136
And your whole life
changed overnight.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.038
New home. New... father.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.640
Well, I don't have
an old father,

18:27.774 --> 18:30.076
and my new home is paradise,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.912
so... I'm doing fine.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.785
Um, just...
you know, being our age,

18:38.918 --> 18:41.321
I mean,
everyone is always like,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.056
"Come on, millennials,
get with the program."

18:44.191 --> 18:46.659
And we are just like...

18:49.696 --> 18:51.731
I get it. Yeah.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.866
It is really hard to be
on fleek.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.135
- Fleek?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.506
When the struggle is real,
I can't even...

18:59.639 --> 19:02.074
Okay, just stop.
Are you really 25?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.412
I mean... kinda.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.315
So... kind of no.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.050
Is it that obvious?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.686
We're not millennials.
They're in their 30s.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.023
We are Gen-Z,
but we don't say that.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.792
Also fleek--no.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.361
"The struggle is real"--no.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.497
And I can't even
with "I can't even."

19:25.665 --> 19:28.868
Damn. I thought I had it.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.103
How old are you?

19:31.238 --> 19:33.039
75.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.974
- Wow!
- Mm.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.410
- You look good.
- Okay.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.911
Island Magic or something?

19:39.045 --> 19:40.247
Mm-hmm.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.115
- We can fix this.
- Hmm.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.752
We can make you act
your new age.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.955
To start, do not use
a cry/laugh emoji.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.159
- But it's so adorable.
- It's wrong.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.696
And you should just feel
that it's wrong.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.699
Okay! All right.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.604
Here's a thought.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.138
- Hmm?
- What if we just

20:06.273 --> 20:08.174
grab one of those bottles
and get out of here?

20:08.308 --> 20:11.378
And I can give you
some youth lessons.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.881
Ha ha.
Walking out on my job? Uh...

20:18.585 --> 20:21.754
I mean, it is
a 20-something thing to do.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.458
Let's do it.
Yeah. Okay.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.629
Run! Come on!

20:33.800 --> 20:35.335
I guess it'd be cool
if they got married,

20:35.468 --> 20:37.804
Roarke and Javier,
but I don't know.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.372
Do marriages work?

20:39.506 --> 20:41.408
Mine did.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.810
You were a lesbian
married to a dude.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.578
Okay.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.180
I mean, it wasn't perfect,

20:48.315 --> 20:52.519
but it was better
than whatever I've found since.

20:52.652 --> 20:57.590
I mean, Dr. Gina,
it was so right, you know?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.828
Like, she was a woman.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.996
Should have more criteria.

21:05.698 --> 21:09.201
Wow. You know what?
I put back on my wedding ring.

21:09.336 --> 21:14.307
Just a signal to the world
that I am... done.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.544
I mean, what's the point?

21:17.677 --> 21:19.178
Yes!

21:19.312 --> 21:20.413
Yes. Yes.

21:20.547 --> 21:23.883
What is the point
is very 20-something.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.185
Yay. Ha ha.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.720
Cheers.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.189
To... nihilism.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.843
Dutch and Dolly,

21:50.977 --> 21:52.211
your two souls
have found each other

21:52.345 --> 21:53.446
on our beautiful Island,

21:53.580 --> 21:55.615
and you have decided
to combine your lives

21:55.748 --> 21:57.584
as quickly as possible.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.719
So I don't wanna waste
any precious time.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.221
Dutch, do you vow to love,

22:02.355 --> 22:04.190
honor,
and cherish Dolly-Louise?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.992
I sure do.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.927
Dolly, do you vow to love, honor,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.629
and cherish Dutch?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.698
I do.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.535
You may put the rings
onto each other's fingers.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.312
I now declare you--

22:26.446 --> 22:27.814
Wait.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.417
Oh, something's wrong.
- Oh, hell no.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.951
We did it again?

22:32.084 --> 22:34.286
What--
are you drinking again?

22:34.421 --> 22:35.788
- Ice.
- Ice. Oh, nice.

22:35.922 --> 22:39.626
You know, an ice angel
isn't gonna help you.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.128
This is not
what we asked for.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.763
You wanted to know
if you should stay together,

22:43.896 --> 22:45.865
and the Island
gave you a clean slate.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.968
You could choose
each other again or not.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.803
It appears that you chose.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.172
No, we absolutely did not.
You tricked us.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.675
Worse than that,
you played with us.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.611
You clearly think our
marriage is some kind of game.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.146
No.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.453
Now it's a game.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.755
Welcome to
"This Is Your Marriage,"

23:08.888 --> 23:12.124
the game of
malicious assumptions.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.503
I miss my mom.

23:25.438 --> 23:26.773
Yeah.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.276
Just confirms that there's
no reward for being good.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.780
You know,
she was my only tether,

23:33.913 --> 23:38.417
and now it just kind of
feels like I'm floating.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.721
You went looking
for another tether.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.190
I just thought if I
figured out who my dad is

23:44.323 --> 23:46.392
then I would figure out
who I'm supposed to be.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.496
But like maybe if like there's
somebody that cares about me

23:49.629 --> 23:51.964
and he's got like wisdom
or something...

23:52.098 --> 23:54.000
Yeah. Makes sense.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.368
But then I meet this guy
who's like--don't get me wrong,

23:56.503 --> 23:58.304
he's cool and all, but like,

23:58.437 --> 24:01.207
I don't know what it's supposed
to feel like to have a dad.

24:01.340 --> 24:04.977
Maybe he would feel more
like a dad to you if you tried,

24:05.111 --> 24:06.979
I don't know, calling him Dad?

24:08.147 --> 24:11.684
Yeah, no, no.
I'm not there yet. Sorry.

24:11.818 --> 24:16.422
You know, I remember
watching Mel with our kids,

24:16.556 --> 24:18.991
and he was so patient,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.829
and he always had the best
advice like my dad used to.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.066
But then later he'd come to me
and be like, you know,

24:27.199 --> 24:30.770
"Did I say the right thing?
Was that good?"

24:32.004 --> 24:35.808
I realized that
he didn't really know.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.678
You know, probably my dad
didn't either.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.847
We're back to
"What's the point?"

24:40.980 --> 24:42.682
No, wait, hold on.

24:42.815 --> 24:47.019
The point is
that he was trying, okay?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.855
We had this one daughter
of ours

24:48.988 --> 24:51.057
that was just a bundle
of trouble,

24:51.190 --> 24:55.027
but he never gave up. Never.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.797
He was always finding
new ways to help.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.267
And that's what makes a dad.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.737
Now, sure, it takes time,
but the beautiful thing

25:04.871 --> 25:08.741
is Javier wants to be a dad
to you.

25:08.875 --> 25:13.580
But he just doesn't know
how any more than Mel.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.751
So let him try, you know,

25:18.885 --> 25:23.455
and maybe you need to try
a little on your end too.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.736
Our contestants
are Dutch and Dolly Paymer.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.805
They hail from Toledo, Ohio,
and share a mortgage,

25:38.938 --> 25:41.941
two grown kids,
and a pug named Snuffles.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.277
Is their marriage
a source of mutual strength,

25:45.411 --> 25:47.614
or a handcuffed march
to the grave?

25:47.747 --> 25:49.515
<i>audience: Ooh!</i>
- Let's spin that wheel.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.786
What the holy hell
is going on?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.955
Oh, it is simple.
This is your chance to discover

25:56.088 --> 25:57.657
how clearly you see your spouse.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.693
You prove that you see
each other accurately,

26:00.827 --> 26:01.928
and you win big.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.096
But if you only see
what you expect to see

26:04.230 --> 26:07.133
based on your own
ungenerous assumptions,

26:07.266 --> 26:08.668
then you have to pay
the penalty.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.336
- Penalty?
- Mm-hmm.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.071
Ha ha ha ha ha!

26:12.204 --> 26:13.572
Well, now that we all know
the rules,

26:13.706 --> 26:14.607
let's check out
the first category.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.042
Who knows the rules?
Nobody.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.309
What rules?

26:19.478 --> 26:22.815
Are You Trying
to Push my Buttons?

26:22.949 --> 26:26.018
Dutch,
why does Dolly open the window

26:26.152 --> 26:27.486
in the middle of the night?

26:27.620 --> 26:30.256
Okay, we're not playing,
so don't answer him, Dutch.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.323
You told me you knew
each other

26:31.457 --> 26:32.524
when you first arrived

26:32.659 --> 26:34.060
and then you said it
all over again

26:34.193 --> 26:36.528
when you met each other
with a blank slate.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.932
It's the one constant.
Should be very easy to prove.

26:40.066 --> 26:44.436
She does it to wake me up.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.038
Dutch is right.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.540
Dolly does it to wake him up.

26:48.675 --> 26:52.344
Follow-up question to Dutch.
Why does she want you awake?

26:52.478 --> 26:54.246
To make me miserable?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.716
Oh no. I'm sorry.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.651
She actually does it because

26:58.785 --> 27:00.687
she confronts her deepest fears
in the middle of the night

27:00.820 --> 27:03.522
and she feels less alone
when you're awake too.

27:03.656 --> 27:04.657
Really?

27:04.791 --> 27:06.859
Yeah. I'm sorry, Dutch,

27:06.993 --> 27:08.260
but we're gonna have to
take that one away from you.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.562
We're gonna count that
as wrong.

27:10.697 --> 27:14.366
- Oh.
- Hey! No way.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.802
Remember the rules.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.704
- We don't know the rules!
- We don't know the rules!

27:17.837 --> 27:20.006
If one of you sinks,
you both sink.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.174
That's how marriage works.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.542
Next round.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.515
Dolly, from the question,
Are You Even Listening:

27:29.648 --> 27:33.786
why does Dutch ask you to stay
close by him at parties?

27:33.920 --> 27:35.521
Because he wants to be able
to swoop in

27:35.654 --> 27:38.057
in case I say something
he considers embarrassing.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.525
What?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.894
Ooh! 0 for 2.

27:42.028 --> 27:45.564
No, actually, he gets anxious
around people he doesn't know,

27:45.698 --> 27:47.366
and having you nearby
makes him feel better.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.136
<i>audience: Aw!</i>
- Oh, I didn't know that.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.603
I've told you
a hundred times.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.372
Well,
I guess I wasn't listening.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.408
Wait, what the hell is that now?

27:56.542 --> 27:59.178
Oh, it's the Lightning Round.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.748
Relax, Dolly.
That's not real lightning.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.950
This better not be
real lightning.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.385
Here's a category.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.555
Guess Why I'm Mad.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.058
Dutch, why did Dolly

28:12.191 --> 28:15.527
throw out your golf clubs
after you told her not to?

28:15.661 --> 28:18.564
- To keep me from golfing?
- Ah.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.566
Because I like it?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.501
Incorrect.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.404
- Whoa!
- Be very careful here.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.240
I like you staying home
with me,

28:28.374 --> 28:31.143
which I told you
a hundred times.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.578
Oh, Dolly, that's so nice,

28:32.711 --> 28:34.046
but it's not exactly true either.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.816
You also think
it's a huge waste of money.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.919
No, no! It wasn't
my turn to answer.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.587
And I didn't answer.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.922
Lightning Round rules.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.391
We don't know the rules!

28:45.524 --> 28:47.093
You need to really try
to see each other.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.461
Come on.
I know you can do this.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.763
Uh-oh.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.698
Where are these sounds
coming from?

28:52.832 --> 28:55.467
That means
it's our Sudden Death Round.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.204
Well, actually, it's more
of a slow suffocation.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.172
- Okay, you can't kill us.
- What?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.774
The Island isn't killing you.

29:01.908 --> 29:05.277
The way you're treating
your marriage is killing you.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.546
All right. Dolly,

29:07.679 --> 29:12.351
Dutch has been watching
his diet and going to the gym.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.820
Why?

29:15.888 --> 29:18.157
Well, it's classic,
isn't it?

29:18.290 --> 29:20.927
He's either got someone else

29:21.060 --> 29:23.796
or he's looking for
someone else.

29:23.930 --> 29:24.797
Incorrect.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.632
- Aah!
- Aah!

29:26.765 --> 29:28.200
- Next question.
- Wait, wait, was that wrong?

29:28.334 --> 29:29.635
Why?

29:29.768 --> 29:30.970
Sudden Death rules.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.105
Dutch, why have you been

29:33.239 --> 29:35.842
checking the balance on your
joint account every week?

29:35.975 --> 29:37.309
Careful now.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.744
Because she's been
transferring money

29:38.878 --> 29:40.246
into her personal account.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.849
That's what you do
when you're about to leave.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.083
No, that's not right.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.551
Very mysterious.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.653
$20,000.
I know you're going.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.688
I'm not leaving you, Dutch.

29:49.822 --> 29:53.325
- You should.
- Wait, I should?

29:53.459 --> 29:54.526
There's one more
question, guys.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.195
Shut up. I have a question.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.898
Dutch, Dutch. Look at me.

29:59.031 --> 30:03.903
What is going on with you?
Just tell me.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.678
I want out.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.516
Oh-ho! That's correct!

30:17.649 --> 30:19.751
Great job, Paymers!

30:29.495 --> 30:33.699
You want out?
Of our marriage.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.437
I'm sorry.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.121
Oh, sorry.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.822
Didn't see you there.
- It's my fault.

30:56.956 --> 31:00.559
I was creeping.
I've been making a list.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.760
- Okay.
- It's a list of things

31:01.894 --> 31:03.162
that you need to understand.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.932
First,
I bite my nails sometimes.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.599
- I know you do.
- Okay, no, wait.

31:07.733 --> 31:08.935
Because this is serious.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.869
Look, I'm biting my nails, right?

31:11.003 --> 31:12.638
- Sexy.
- Stop, Javier.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.306
No, it's gonna look
like I'm bored,

31:14.440 --> 31:16.308
but really I'm anxious.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.144
So you need to not
call me on it.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.779
And I also--I hum
when I drive long distances,

31:20.913 --> 31:22.748
you know, the same little tune
over and over and over again.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.616
And it's gonna seem like
I'm trying to make you crazy,

31:24.750 --> 31:27.119
but actually,
I don't even hear it.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.687
That one you should
call me on.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.356
- Noted.
- Also if I want you to eat

31:30.489 --> 31:31.991
something that
you don't want to eat,

31:32.124 --> 31:34.126
it's because I generally
like generally feel

31:34.260 --> 31:35.394
that it's gonna make you happier,

31:35.527 --> 31:37.163
but I'll stop if you
want me to--capiche?

31:37.296 --> 31:39.398
- Okay.
- Ah, and if I leave things

31:39.531 --> 31:41.233
out on the countertop,
it doesn't mean that

31:41.367 --> 31:42.634
I don't respectful
where you live, okay?

31:42.768 --> 31:44.336
I just... I forget.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.105
So we have a countertop.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.140
Is it a butcher block
or marble?

31:48.274 --> 31:49.841
Okay. That not the issue.
Come on.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.343
Okay. Got it.
It's a good list.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.479
For the record, I hate olives.
- What?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.514
Well, obviously
you haven't had the good ones.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.183
'Cause olives are really good.
I'm sorry.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.551
I'm sorry, okay! No olives.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.353
Thank you.
But Elena, did you

32:01.487 --> 32:03.889
really think little stuff
like this would bother me?

32:04.023 --> 32:05.857
Oh, not at first,
but little assumptions.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.426
They pile up, right?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.428
And if you don't take them off
the pile right away,

32:09.561 --> 32:10.596
you know, they build up,
and over the years,

32:10.729 --> 32:11.830
it's gonna
bite us right in the ass.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.765
Over the years?

32:13.899 --> 32:16.302
Yes.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.170
Over the years.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.506
So you have to take it seriously.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.774
Hmm?
- I promise to do my best

32:22.908 --> 32:24.810
to remember those
even after all those years.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.380
And if I mess up,
don't assume I don't care.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.682
I sometimes forget too.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.820
- All right.
- Good deal.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.095
No, wait, no, hold on.

33:16.228 --> 33:17.896
No, that part's like
super needy.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.365
Do dial it back.
- Okay.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.467
It's a little defensive,
that part in the middle.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.934
All right. Okay.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.503
Okay. Read it back.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.273
Okay.
"Gina.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.007
"Sorry I wasn't what
I should have been.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.343
You were right.
I was..."

33:33.412 --> 33:36.215
"Maybe out of my head."

33:37.849 --> 33:42.288
Oh, wait, no, no
laughing/crying emoji.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.456
You don't--no, yeah.
- No, no.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.093
Okay.
"And I'm thinking you're right.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.928
"I could do better,
but also what if I couldn't

33:50.062 --> 33:53.465
"because sometimes people
can't, and doesn't even matter.

33:53.599 --> 33:58.003
So call me, please.
What if I'm sorry?"

33:58.137 --> 34:02.074
And then six
question marks after.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.375
Swoosh it on out there.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.311
- Really?
- Swoosh it.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.479
Swoosh!

34:07.613 --> 34:10.649
It's gone. That is gone.

34:10.782 --> 34:14.653
Oh!
I feel so much lighter.

34:14.786 --> 34:19.258
You know,
I am so not afraid anymore.

34:19.391 --> 34:23.362
Whoa. Like I don't--I don't
need to be done, right?

34:23.495 --> 34:29.000
Like I don't need to tell
the world that I'm done!

34:30.902 --> 34:36.408
Wait. No, no, no, no. Oh, God.
Oh, wait--

34:36.542 --> 34:39.511
What is that? Did you see it?

34:41.447 --> 34:44.350
You are a brave woman.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.018
I mean there's--
did you see that?

34:47.153 --> 34:49.188
You are brave and smart.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.889
- Oh.
- And old.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.124
Okay.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.825
But you're young
and you're young.

34:53.959 --> 34:57.296
Wait, you said young twice.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.966
No, no. You did young twice.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.668
And I think that is so dope.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.137
And the advice that you gave
about Javier is great.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.972
And you're my awesome
granny friend.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.175
And I love you. I love you.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.943
Ohh...

35:16.448 --> 35:18.684
You okay? What's wrong?

35:18.817 --> 35:21.687
Oh, okay.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.390
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.558
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.040
Are you dying?

35:53.185 --> 35:56.087
I mean, everybody's dying, right?

35:56.222 --> 35:59.425
I'm just doing it a little
faster than you, maybe.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.293
We have to talk
to the cardiologist

36:01.427 --> 36:02.728
and find out what to do.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.764
I've done that.
It's a valve disease.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.066
- Oh my God.
- I can manage it.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.670
All I have to do is lower my
cholesterol and get in shape.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.739
Okay. So this is why
you've been passing out,

36:13.872 --> 36:15.173
isn't it?

36:15.307 --> 36:17.576
And why you're suddenly
into alternative medicine.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.546
I figure whatever works.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.581
And why you've been
going to the gym.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.115
Right.

36:24.250 --> 36:28.954
I'm not looking for
somebody new.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.390
So you really don't want out.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.494
I knew you were
thinking of leaving.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.629
And if I sprang this hard
thing on you,

36:37.763 --> 36:40.699
you just feel manipulated, burdened.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.968
Dutch.
I want you to burden me.

36:43.101 --> 36:46.438
I want to take care of you.
I was never leaving you.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.408
Well, the 20k says otherwise

36:53.412 --> 36:57.249
I got into this poetry
writing retreat--

36:57.383 --> 36:59.985
a month in Tuscany.

37:00.118 --> 37:02.688
Super elite.
I didn't tell you

37:02.821 --> 37:05.357
because I knew that you'd think
it was a waste of money.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.125
Not true.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.928
- Come on.
- Okay. Yeah.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.463
Honestly, before this trip,

37:11.597 --> 37:15.734
I probably would've
thought that, but not anymore.

37:15.867 --> 37:20.171
And it's kind of terrifying,
you being in Tuscany

37:20.306 --> 37:22.308
meeting interesting,
talented people.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.313
You're afraid of losing me?

37:28.347 --> 37:31.216
I love you.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.352
Even when things are bad

37:33.485 --> 37:38.624
and I want you there more
than I don't want you there.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.960
Well, I love you too.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.163
And I want you there more than
I don't want you there.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.666
Ah, we have to stop assuming

37:47.799 --> 37:49.267
we know what the other
person's thinking.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.337
Yeah. Yeah, we have

37:51.470 --> 37:54.340
clearly proven that
we're pretty terrible at it.

37:58.176 --> 38:02.381
After we see a cardiologist,
you wanna go to Tuscany?

38:02.514 --> 38:04.750
Hell, yes.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.390
<i>♪ As long as I have you ♪</i>

38:11.523 --> 38:13.359
I see you.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.826

38:14.960 --> 38:16.362
Yeah, I see you.

38:16.495 --> 38:19.865

38:19.998 --> 38:23.569

38:23.702 --> 38:27.005

38:30.509 --> 38:33.111

38:34.646 --> 38:37.349
This can wait.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.185
Okay.

38:53.399 --> 38:55.200
Something you have
to take care of?

38:55.333 --> 38:58.904
Actually, I think this one
is for both of us.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.113
Hey.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.048
Mama?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.250
No, it's me, Elena. Come on.
Let's get outta here.

39:12.384 --> 39:15.954
Oh, come on. Wait.
Why are you both here?

39:16.087 --> 39:19.090
I heard from Gina.
Something about a text.

39:19.224 --> 39:22.360
Oh, yeah.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.229
Ruby's a terrible drunk.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.132
Is that right?
I never knew.

39:27.265 --> 39:28.900
Turtle armature.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.336
Damn, wait.
No. Total amateur.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.239
Okay. Okay.
Let's go. Let's go.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.410
Do you know
she used to be old?

39:38.544 --> 39:40.311
You can tell me all about it

39:40.446 --> 39:41.913
in the long stagger
back to your room.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.181
- Am I gonna get a lecture?
- No.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.516
You need help with her?

39:44.650 --> 39:48.053
No, no.
This is something I know to do.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.921
Okay. Bye!

39:50.055 --> 39:51.957
Ruby, let's go.

39:56.127 --> 40:00.265
All right, here we go.
Let's get you to bed.

40:04.335 --> 40:07.172
Okay.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.774
All right, kiddo.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.009
There's aspirin
on the nightstand

40:11.142 --> 40:12.778
when you wake up, okay?

40:12.911 --> 40:17.048
Just find that little trash
basket for you just in case.

40:27.593 --> 40:32.197
You can just go to sleep now.
I'll be right here.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.737
Thanks, Dad.

40:47.679 --> 40:50.215
You got your shoes all wet.

40:50.348 --> 40:51.617
Oh, ugh.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.785
I don't know
if they're gonna be okay.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.522
Oh, too bad. You know,

40:56.655 --> 41:00.526
I remembered something
about being young tonight.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.393
Oh, what did you remember?

41:02.528 --> 41:06.698
Well, that being young
♪ sucks ♪

41:09.067 --> 41:11.603
I hear a buzzing sound.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.672
It's buzzing.
- No, it's the phone.

41:13.805 --> 41:14.940
It's the phone.
- Hello?

41:15.073 --> 41:16.575
It's a text from Javier.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.376
Oh, what did he say?

41:18.510 --> 41:23.882
It says, "She called me Dad."

41:35.426 --> 41:39.130
- Good morning.
- Mm. That is your opinion.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.601
And can you please
turn the sun down a notch?

41:42.734 --> 41:44.970
Well, what is the point of
having a magical island

41:45.103 --> 41:47.238
if it doesn't have a dimmer?

41:48.907 --> 41:52.510
Oh, thank you so much.
We hated a lot of it.

41:52.644 --> 41:55.080
But it led us back
to each other,

41:55.213 --> 41:56.548
which we really needed.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.684
Oh, it was my pleasure.

41:58.817 --> 42:00.852
We've got a call later
with the kids.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.788
They're gonna be so surprised
we're not fighting.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.856
They're gonna think
we're dying,

42:04.990 --> 42:07.158
Which we are gonna do
everything we can to try

42:07.292 --> 42:10.729
to make sure
it doesn't happen anytime soon.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.263
- Never.
- Ever.

42:12.397 --> 42:14.933
I bet your kids are gonna be
very happy for you.

42:15.066 --> 42:16.234
Family like that,
that's a gift.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.738
- Javier is a new father.
- Oh, we love babies.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.541
Well, it's actually a--
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.210
Treasure this time.

42:25.343 --> 42:27.746
But don't let 'em distract
you from other things

42:27.879 --> 42:29.648
that are just as important.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.416
Oh...

42:32.183 --> 42:34.052
Never.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.927
Oh yeah.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.630
I'm definitely hearing
the sweet sound of--

42:44.763 --> 42:46.431
Don't say it.
