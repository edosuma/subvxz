about that to your sister.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.783
- All right, yeah.
What's so urgent?

00:34.827 --> 00:36.035
You pulled me out
of a cape fitting.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.244
- Remember when you said,

00:37.329 --> 00:39.246
"this looks like a good spot
to put a city"?

00:39.290 --> 00:41.790
And I said, "probably not,
because it's a day's walk

00:41.834 --> 00:43.075
From a cannibal horde."

00:43.127 --> 00:44.877

"everywhere is a day's walk

00:44.962 --> 00:46.253
"from a cannibal horde.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.796
That's why cities

What's the problem?

00:53.137 --> 00:54.970

the killassians.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.513

if they're truly cannibals,

00:56.599 --> 00:58.932
Maybe a flaming human head
is their version

00:58.976 --> 00:59.975

Teachable moment.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.068
- Teachable moment?

01:09.111 --> 01:11.195
Then let me teach these
farmers how to fight.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.864
- Right, so then we're fighting
instead of farming.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.032
And guess what's left to eat?

01:15.076 --> 01:17.242
That's how

Look, I know
I'm the little brother,

Civilization is the future.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.707
Savagery is the past.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.884
Why are you here?
And why can't you stay?

01:33.928 --> 01:36.512
- We heard you were starting
one of those newfangled cities

01:36.597 --> 01:39.640
From something we were eating
and-or having sex with.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.142

expect me to stay in this dump

I'm a goddess.

It only took three kinds

Most of them to athena,

gets all those temples

05:52.061 --> 05:53.602

They're powerful.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.608

07:59.396 --> 08:01.438
Ruling isn't easy, clearly.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.689
[laughter]

08:02.733 --> 08:03.982
I'm joking.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.358
My boy was born to be a king.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.445
What other job is there
for a virgin in his 30s

08:08.530 --> 08:09.613
Who can't swing a sword?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.323
[laughter]

08:11.408 --> 08:12.324
I'm 29.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.366
- Sorry, dear.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.618
Can't quite hear
you when you talk

08:14.703 --> 08:16.119
All the way through your nose.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.954
He didn't get
the voice of a conqueror.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.831
But on the plus side,
he didn't get

08:19.875 --> 08:21.458
Any other parts of one either.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.542
[laughter]

08:22.628 --> 08:24.085
- You know what's really funny?

08:24.129 --> 08:25.921
She gets to live forever,
but she's dead inside.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.508
And it's her fault
I'm terrible with women.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.675
I agree.

08:30.719 --> 08:31.843
It's not laugh-out-loud funny.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.220
Here's the truth.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.930
She's only here
because she's out of options.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.307
She had power,
but she squandered it.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.975
Now she needs worshippers,

08:39.061 --> 08:40.727
And she thinks
you're stupid enough

08:40.812 --> 08:42.646
To build her a temple.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.647
- Let's do it.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.065
[cheers and applause]

08:45.150 --> 08:48.735
All: Temple, temple,
temple, temple, temple.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.989
- Deliria,
goddess of human appeal.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.705
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

09:00.791 --> 09:02.123
- Son, quick question.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.501
With humans domesticating
animals,

09:04.545 --> 09:06.878
Which ones are off the table
sexually?

09:06.922 --> 09:08.255
What's all this?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.090
- This is enchanted
god-proof armor.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.717
I've been saving it
for the day I kill mother.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.094
Step aside.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.972
- If you got that
from xantheses in nigeria,

09:17.057 --> 09:19.307
You should know
it's made of tin.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.642
- Enchanted tin.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.726
Ow.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.811
It's cutting me.

09:22.854 --> 09:23.853
- He's a swindler, son.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.146
- Get it off.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.274
- You're wearing
a suit of scissors.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.484
You don't really want
to kill your mother, do you?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.610
- Why?

09:30.696 --> 09:32.529
Would you help me or stop me?

09:32.573 --> 09:34.155
Exactly.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.616
Dad, you can't give me advice,
because you don't do anything,

09:36.660 --> 09:39.369
Except from what it sounds
like, the occasional chicken.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.413
- You're wrong about me, son.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.498
I specifically came here to
get a ruling on the chicken

09:43.584 --> 09:44.916
Situation before I--

09:44.960 --> 09:46.668
- You know who's good at
all the things mom respects?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.003
A bunch of dead people.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.212
You know who's going
to run the future?

09:49.256 --> 09:52.215
Diplomats, negotiators,
dealmakers,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.926
People that make things work,
like me

09:54.970 --> 09:56.928
If she'd get out of my way.

09:56.972 --> 09:57.887
- I believe you, son.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.222
Humanity's on the rise.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.391
What you've done
to the chicken alone--

10:01.476 --> 10:02.267
- Dad.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.351
- May I just ask?

10:03.395 --> 10:06.104
If your divine gift
is for dealmaking,

10:06.148 --> 10:10.317
Why is it you can't deal
with your mother?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.527
- Ok, put those over there.

10:12.571 --> 10:13.612
That should be straighter.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.989
No.
Look, make it like that.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.657
- Can't you just do that
four times and--

10:17.701 --> 10:18.867
- And make my own temple?

10:18.910 --> 10:19.868
Brilliant pitch.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.119
Here's another one.

10:21.163 --> 10:21.995
Anyone else looking
to collaborate?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.371
- Hello.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.498
- If you're concealing
a nigerian god-killing dagger,

10:25.584 --> 10:26.458
I have bad news.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.334
- I'm here to deal.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.960
- You have nothing to offer.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.087
- If that were true,
you wouldn't be here.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.965
- When I had you, I had a
dream that you would conquer

10:34.009 --> 10:35.425
The world, gods and all.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.886
And when they looked up
and said, "who are you?"

10:37.929 --> 10:39.971
You'd say,
"I'm the son of deliria.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.182
And you should have been nicer
to her."

10:42.267 --> 10:43.558
- It's not a bad dream, mom.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.677
But we might have
to help each other out.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.354
My city needs protection.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.521
You need a temple.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.564
These people need a break.

10:49.650 --> 10:50.607
- I've tried that.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.816
They're mostly broken.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.443
I've been animating
their limbs.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.195
<i> [mystical chime]</i>

10:56.698 --> 10:58.156
- Explain this one more time.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.241
- We give them a giant,
wooden horse.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.203
They assume there's dudes
in it, so they set it on fire.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.748
But there's a bomb in it,
so kaboom.

11:06.792 --> 11:07.832
- Ok, but why a horse?

11:07.876 --> 11:09.209
- I don't know.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.544
I just asked myself,
what's the single dumbest gift

11:11.630 --> 11:12.587
You could ever give someone?

11:12.631 --> 11:13.588
Close enough.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.590
Let's jam.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.592
- Hey.

11:17.636 --> 11:22.180
I am asskill,
son of kill, slayer of ass.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.683
- Cool.
- Condolences to ass.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.477
- Are you just
giving this to us?

11:27.562 --> 11:28.561
It's gorgeous.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.522
- I wouldn't go that far.

11:30.607 --> 11:34.567
- If I were you,
I'd set it on fire, later.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.735
- You nuts?

11:35.821 --> 11:37.904
I'm going to cherish it
forever.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.865
- You're that sure
there aren't dudes in it?

11:40.951 --> 11:43.201
- May as well
set it on fire, later.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.829
- Why does it seem
really important to you

11:45.872 --> 11:47.372
That we set this on fire?

11:47.416 --> 11:52.001
- In our culture, possession
is fleeting, like horses,

11:52.045 --> 11:56.089
Whereas fire is eternal,
like friendship.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.092
- Then I love your culture.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.177
I declare peace
with krapopolis.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.723
We feast tonight around the
burning horse of friendship.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.890
[all cheering]

12:05.976 --> 12:08.560
[percussive music]

12:08.645 --> 12:10.353
- This is so awkward.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.189
- You know, our people have
never danced until tonight?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.441
- You wouldn't know.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.526
- Sorry we're taking
so long lighting the horse.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.945
I wanted to make sure
all our oldest women

12:19.030 --> 12:21.781
And youngest children
were seated closest to it.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.199
- We're going to take off.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.953
But listen, you probably
shouldn't light the horse.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.288
- Oh, we're lighting it, baby.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.998
Everyone in the world
is going to see it

12:30.083 --> 12:33.543
And know that the hatred
and violence stops now.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.796
[both sobbing]

12:36.840 --> 12:38.548
- It's ok to cry.

12:38.633 --> 12:39.758
I'll cry with you.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.843
It's acceptable
to be vulnerable now.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.678
Thanks to you.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.638
- The horse is a bomb.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.974
- What's a bomb?

12:48.101 --> 12:52.103
- A horrible, devastating,
really cool new weapon

12:52.147 --> 12:56.608
Designed to kill all of you
at the same time.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.612
- [sobbing]

13:00.697 --> 13:02.447
Seize them!

13:02.532 --> 13:03.782
- No.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.408
- Don't resist.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.452
- We have to.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.912
Sorry.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.622
Sorry. Sorry.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.582
- Stop hitting everyone.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.958
- I have to.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.586
- You're terrible people.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.005
- We know that now.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.634
- You guys are good dancers.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.594
- We love you.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.931
- [grunting]

13:27.974 --> 13:28.932
You want to slow me down
a little?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.099
My neck breaks.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.768
- I've waited too long
for this.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.187
- It's not as if the gods
are going to come running back

13:34.272 --> 13:35.355
As soon as I lay the last--

13:35.440 --> 13:36.689
- Oh, my goddess.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.066
- --Brick.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.609
- Look who's back
at temple level.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.277
- Hermes.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.195
Both: Mwah! Mwah!

13:42.239 --> 13:43.571
- Enjoying your drink, mortal?

13:43.698 --> 13:44.614
- I don't have--
- me neither.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.698
Regrettable, no?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.242
- Fetch two nectars, ty-ty.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.785
- You're missed on olympus.

13:48.870 --> 13:49.786
- That's a lie.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.371
- I don't lie, bitch.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.748
I mean, nobody says how they
feel on olympus, zeus forbid.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.166
Bleh.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.626
But two steps off the
mountain, you know,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.962
All the real gods are like,
"I miss deliria."

13:59.047 --> 14:00.630
- Shut up.
Who?

14:00.715 --> 14:01.589
- Uh, gee. Apollo.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.799
Uh, gee.
Artemis.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.133
Uh, gee.
Athena.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.386
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
Athena said she misses me?

14:06.429 --> 14:07.846
- Why would that surprise you?

14:07.889 --> 14:08.888
You need to realize
who you are.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.932
Thank you, little drink maker.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.141
In fact, that's why I'm here.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.435
I guess there's
a city over there.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.228
- Killasses?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.771
- Uh, ty, gods talking.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.649
- Anyway, killasses is marching
here to invade this city.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.986
And seems like the
killassians worship athena,

14:23.071 --> 14:26.197
And seems like
this city worships you.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.824
Awkward.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.784
But athena says she's willing
to stay hands off if you are.

14:29.870 --> 14:34.330
And she'd love to talk about
getting you back on olympus.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.248
- Ok.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.624
Well, hands off then.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.709
Good to know.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.751
- That's what I deal in.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.878
Good things to know.

14:39.963 --> 14:40.879
Get used to me.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.464
Super speed.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.591
- Hands off?

14:44.634 --> 14:45.592
Hands off?

14:45.635 --> 14:46.843
We gave you a temple.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.261
- Did I really get
a temple, though?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.846
Sounds like it's
going to be athena's.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.264
- You hear?
Invasion coming.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.808
I assume we're
abandoning civilization,

14:53.894 --> 14:55.810
Except for this cup,
which I'd love to keep.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.521
- The two of you everything
I hate about this world.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.522
- You're right, son.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.940
Attachment is dangerous.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.859
- You'd let your entire
family die to boost

15:02.944 --> 15:04.819
Your olympian social status?

15:04.863 --> 15:06.237
- My mortal family.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.906
You die no matter what.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.074
I also have an immortal family.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.993
The social stakes
are higher when

15:12.037 --> 15:13.494
Your social life is forever.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.914
- I can't believe
I ever admired you.

15:16.032 --> 15:17.790
- You certainly
never said you did.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.334
- I couldn't. I was a baby.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.377
It doesn't take long
to stop liking you.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.464
I guess gods and mortals
have that in common.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.175
- You try to raise them right.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.509
- I blame you.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.511

15:48.156 --> 15:50.949
- If we die today,
it will be my honor

15:50.951 --> 15:52.659
To die with most of you.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.035
- Is that directed at me?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.328
- Yes.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.955
- Hey, ty, I have a pretty
intense war machine

15:57.040 --> 15:58.748
That probably won't turn
the tide of battle

15:58.833 --> 16:01.626
But will definitely look
really cool during the battle,

16:01.670 --> 16:02.669
And I--

16:02.712 --> 16:03.670
- Do whatever you want.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.296
- Thank you.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.924
- Hey, listen, go hide.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.926
I can tell them
you hung yourself.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.761
A lot of kings do it
in this situation.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.129
It's a thing.
- Nah.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.389
- This is my fault.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.683
- You saved my life a lot
when we were kids.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.101
- I tried to kill you
a lot too.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.561
- Well, mission accomplished.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.026
Hi.
I'm tyrannis.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.028
I brought you
a basket of...Olives.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.698
- Just tell me how
you want to die.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.741
- That's fair.
Oh, wow.

16:33.827 --> 16:34.659
You're big.

16:34.744 --> 16:35.785
Sorry.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.245
Oh.

16:37.288 --> 16:37.996
Ah.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.039
Uh, it's my first battle.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.125
- How are you even a king?

16:42.252 --> 16:44.585
- This will not shock you,
but I sort of

16:44.671 --> 16:46.546
Talked my way into the job.

16:46.589 --> 16:50.133
My end game was to make
a world that ran on talking.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.509
Clearly, for selfish reasons.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.220
But I told my brother
and sister, "let's not fight

16:54.264 --> 16:55.763
These guys;
let's talk to them."

16:55.807 --> 16:56.931
- Oh, they talk.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.474
That's all you people do.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.644
Called us friends so you
could explode our children.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.354
You can't be trusted.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.149
- You're right.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.152
Because we took your trust,
and we didn't give any back.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.195
So what if we trusted you now?

17:11.239 --> 17:14.565
What if we just open
our gates and let you in.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.533
- Please do.

17:15.577 --> 17:16.868
It's called an invasion.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.327
- Or an invitation.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.664
What if we welcomed you in
and gave you our trust

17:21.708 --> 17:23.124
Until we earn yours back?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.126
We're farmers; you're fighters.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.212
If we combine our strengths,
we could build something

17:28.256 --> 17:32.675
Greater than any other city,
an alliance, an empire.

17:32.761 --> 17:33.801
- What's an empire?

17:33.928 --> 17:34.927
- I don't know yet.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.430
But it's going to be huge.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.015
- What is happening?

17:40.769 --> 17:42.518
- We're discussing things.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.228
- So I noticed.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.688
I'm not the goddess
of conversation, you wet fart.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.441
Conquer these people
and make them worship me.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.484
- Athena--

17:49.527 --> 17:50.943
- Uh, did I address you?

17:50.987 --> 17:53.946
Who are you even ever even?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.948
- I'm the son
of deliria,

17:56.034 --> 17:57.617
And you should have been nicer
to her.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.618
- Excuse me?

17:58.661 --> 18:00.787
- You heard him.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.038
- Mama?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.331
- But apparently,
I heard wrong.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.125
I was told
this war was hands off.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.418
- Deliria.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.337
- Athena, goddess of--
what's the list up to now,

18:09.380 --> 18:12.298
War, wisdom, over-the-top
outfits, and daddy issues?

18:12.383 --> 18:13.341
- Ok.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.051
So we're going
to talk about wardrobe?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.844
Are you attacking ever or--

18:16.930 --> 18:18.012
- You can say no.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.388
- You're joking, right?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.515
Attack!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.058
- Attack!
- Ahh!

18:22.102 --> 18:23.184
- You are aware
that we can, like,

18:23.269 --> 18:25.269
Change our clothing,
bodies too.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.479
- You'd know.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.731
You change your face
in every conversation.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.274
- [grunts]
- ah.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.150
- [grunts]

18:31.236 --> 18:32.393
- Ah.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.446
- How about I change
your army into snakes?

18:35.532 --> 18:36.489
- Snakes?

18:36.574 --> 18:37.865
So lazy.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.909
- So you never turn
people into snakes?

18:39.953 --> 18:41.077
- Constantly.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.161
When I'm lazy.
- Snake.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.288
Snake. Snake. Snake. Snake.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.748
- Right.
This is what you look like.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.710
Snake. Snake. Snake. Snake.
Snake.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.296
- [screams]
[bones crunching]

18:52.382 --> 18:53.548
[shouts]

18:55.260 --> 18:57.260
- Snake. Snake.
- Snake. Snake.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.845
- [grunts]
- [grunts]

18:58.930 --> 19:00.304
- [grunts]

19:06.729 --> 19:08.646
[crowd screams]

19:08.731 --> 19:10.148
[both grunting]

19:10.233 --> 19:12.775
- You think you'll ever
be back on olympus again?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.861
It's sad you try.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.362
- Sadder that you care.

19:16.447 --> 19:20.783
- Oh, I don't care about
trash, but I still take it out.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.618
I guess you just sleep with it.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.911
- Excuse me.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.622
Would you mind
not slut-shaming my mom?

19:26.666 --> 19:27.790
She is my mom.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.542
I owe my life
to her being a slut.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.835
- Sorry.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.296
I can't hear you over
the sound of snake.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.463
- No.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.090
- Aw, no family left.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.467
You couldn't even
make your own.

19:38.553 --> 19:42.388
- Someone tell tyrannis
I'm doing something.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.766
- Run!

19:45.810 --> 19:49.061
[loud explosion]

19:52.567 --> 19:54.025
- All hail deliria.

19:54.068 --> 19:58.154
[cheers and applause]

20:00.033 --> 20:01.908
- What is me?

20:01.993 --> 20:04.160
I can smell heat
with my tongue.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.162
- Ugh.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.914
- I'm not mentioning
today to anyone,

20:07.999 --> 20:10.082
Unless I ever see you again.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.626
- Ahh! Like I care.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.752
Get off me.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.128
Like I care about any of you.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.088
Like I care about anything.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.424
Like I even care about myself.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.343
Like I even have to.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.971
- Hail tyrannis.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.223
- Say something to your people.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.515
- Sure.

20:26.643 --> 20:31.520
I have strange legs,
hot sun, danger, only mice.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.647
Find mice.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.689
Delicious mice.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.024
Warm sun forever.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.525
- You get the king you get.

20:36.611 --> 20:37.526
Now cheer.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.528
All: Yay.

20:48.665 --> 20:49.580
- Thank you.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.790
- Next.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.250
- There's three days
of mice in here.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.086
After that, he should
be back to normal meals.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.630
- Darling, I'm sorry,
but that one is just a snake.

20:57.715 --> 20:58.798
- Then where's my husband?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.216
- It's war, honey.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.551
- If you find another snake,
we're here until sundown.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.844
- [sobs]

21:03.930 --> 21:05.054
- Thanks for doing this,
by the way.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.264
There's three days
of mice in here.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.848
Thank you for your service.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.475
And, you know,
thank you for coming back.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.811
- I came back because I hate
athena slightly more

21:11.896 --> 21:13.354
Than your awful city.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.939
Next.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.691
Pleased me to see you
willing to fight.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.025
- I bet.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.986
Three days of mice.
Thank you so much.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.947
Someone told me that when
I got turned into a snake,

21:23.032 --> 21:24.699
You screamed no.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.825
- Oh, stick it up your ass.

21:25.868 --> 21:26.784
- Screw you.

21:26.869 --> 21:27.827
Three days of mice.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.370
Thank you.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.539
<i> - Did you get any of that?</i>

21:33.710 --> 21:35.501
<i> - Bento.</i>
<i> [all cheer]</i>
