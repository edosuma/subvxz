<i>Others said we just got a certain
way of doing things down here.</i>

01:15.058 --> 01:16.520
<i>But it ain't that either.</i>

01:17.561 --> 01:20.185

They had a lot of weight,
maybe too much.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.575
It's a ring. Organised burglary.

You saw them guys.

Ten months ago, judge

Well, I got a Ruger from Weiland's
toilet and rushed it through Ballistics.

- And?
- It's a solid match. Dead on.

11:06.442 --> 11:08.276
There's a dozen ways Weiland
could've got that burner.

- It don't prove a thing.
- How about this?

gone bad then.

11:19.371 --> 11:22.039

more guns, more cases.

- So who's backing him?
- I don't know.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.978
But I do know they'll
post his bond.

11:43.979 --> 11:47.607
That's why I need a price that
they can't come up with overnight.

11:47.608 --> 11:49.358
I'm right about this, Mike.

11:49.359 --> 11:53.071
When a guy's looking at 200
years and he ain't upset,

you of fucking the neighbour

12:06.627 --> 12:07.752
He's not upset.

12:07.753 --> 12:11.380
He's making eye contact
'cause we're falling short.

12:11.381 --> 12:14.172
This guy knows things.
He knows where bodies are.

Well, we got him on

- There's way more.

Race riots, smuggling,
extorting a guard.

13:29.626 --> 13:32.211

33:19.483 --> 33:21.443
About time for a new
truck there, Jesse.

33:23.904 --> 33:25.988
It's good to see you out.

33:25.989 --> 33:27.782
A free man now.

33:27.783 --> 33:29.784
What's going on, Fish?

33:29.785 --> 33:32.578
On a Sunday drive, that's all.

33:32.579 --> 33:37.125
The good Lord riding shotgun through
another glorious Louisiana morning.

33:38.127 --> 33:40.753
Say, Jesse...

33:40.754 --> 33:43.177
Lutin's been asking about you.

33:44.925 --> 33:46.303
In fact, a lot of people are.

33:48.929 --> 33:51.898
You tell Lutin I'm gonna
come by and see him.

33:52.266 --> 33:54.142
That's good.

33:55.811 --> 33:58.316
See you real soon then.

34:03.607 --> 34:05.374
(ENGINE REVVING)

34:11.118 --> 34:14.911
This organisation of yours
has become big business.

34:14.913 --> 34:19.292
And professionally speaking, I feel you
need relationships now more than ever.

34:19.293 --> 34:22.003
Now we've done some business
in the past successfully,

34:22.004 --> 34:25.255
but this here is a
much larger scope.

34:25.257 --> 34:29.302
I'm here today because I want
to represent you exclusively.

34:29.303 --> 34:30.969
I feel that you need
someone lobbying for you

34:30.971 --> 34:33.473
on the state level as
well as in Washington.

34:33.474 --> 34:36.442
My company can
provide that service.

34:53.327 --> 34:55.828
Hey, Mr Jesse.

34:55.829 --> 34:58.370
How you doing, kid?

35:00.375 --> 35:04.341
- Where's the old man?
- He's at a meeting.

35:04.838 --> 35:07.048
CATFISH:
But you can go on in and wait.

35:07.049 --> 35:09.389
DANIEL: I'm aware that you have
multiple businesses.

35:12.221 --> 35:15.640
However, I feel that you
need one go-to guy.

35:15.641 --> 35:19.185
Somebody who's going to
coordinate those ventures

35:19.186 --> 35:22.688
and see that those contracts
and transactions are realised.

35:22.689 --> 35:25.858
That's my job, Mr Adams.
That's what I do.

35:25.859 --> 35:27.169
What's this going to cost us?

35:29.530 --> 35:32.031
Retainer would be $350,000

35:32.032 --> 35:36.202
plus 10% of any economic growth
that I bring your organisation.

35:36.203 --> 35:38.223
Dan, don't you think
that's a little excessive?

35:39.248 --> 35:41.753
I'll give you 2%, Mr Morris.
That's what it's worth.

35:43.085 --> 35:44.585
You know, Mr Adams,
my daddy always said

35:44.586 --> 35:46.813
good things ain't cheap and
cheap things ain't good.

35:47.714 --> 35:51.426
The advance would be
a drop in the bucket.

35:51.427 --> 35:53.718
The real money is
in the percentage.

35:54.263 --> 35:57.564
And it'd be in your
interest to agree with me.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.275
Okay. Fair enough.

36:07.276 --> 36:09.235
You got yourself a deal.

36:09.236 --> 36:10.532
Okay.

36:12.281 --> 36:13.778
Pleasure.

36:19.455 --> 36:23.336
Maybe now he can
afford a new toupee.

36:26.086 --> 36:28.296
Give us a minute, Kiersey.

36:42.811 --> 36:44.937
I see you added to your collection.

36:46.440 --> 36:48.858
I appreciate you making my bail.

36:48.859 --> 36:50.451
It ain't nothing.

36:56.950 --> 37:00.501
- You got a boy now, a son?
- Yeah.

37:01.622 --> 37:04.624
He got a name?

37:04.625 --> 37:06.252
I named him Tommy.

37:08.170 --> 37:09.501
Nice.

37:12.966 --> 37:15.635
Jesse...

37:15.636 --> 37:20.973
You've been a busy boy
in more than one way.

37:20.974 --> 37:24.811
Well, it looks like you
done just fine without me.

37:24.812 --> 37:27.188
You have business rolling
through the door.

37:27.189 --> 37:30.983
The last time I saw you,
you asked for time.

37:30.984 --> 37:35.495
Time to raise a family,
time to straighten things out.

37:36.156 --> 37:39.409
So, I gave you the time.

37:39.410 --> 37:43.329
And then safe jobs popping up.

37:43.330 --> 37:46.332
Lafayette. Clinton.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.334
New Orleans. Baton Rouge.

37:48.335 --> 37:50.336
All over the place.

37:50.337 --> 37:54.841
The boys think it's niggers gone
widespread on a hunt for pig's feet.

37:54.842 --> 37:55.967
But no.

37:55.968 --> 37:58.553
Them's professional burn jobs.

37:58.554 --> 38:05.734
So I says to myself, "This be the work
of a white, respectable burglar."

38:07.354 --> 38:09.065
Jesse.

38:09.857 --> 38:13.234
All that work,

38:13.235 --> 38:17.196
a dozen safe cracking
jobs behind my back,

38:17.197 --> 38:23.583
and never did you consider tribute
or a contribution to the cause.

38:34.173 --> 38:38.553
Just like I said,
I needed a little time.

38:54.026 --> 38:55.441
Well...

38:56.904 --> 39:00.904
Even the prophets, they
stumble from time to time.

39:10.292 --> 39:11.968
Welcome home.

39:14.505 --> 39:17.557
Hey, it's a shame
about your brother.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.559
JESSE:
Y'all wanna talk about crime?

39:28.560 --> 39:31.270
I can tell you things.

39:31.271 --> 39:34.190
Names. Locations.

39:34.191 --> 39:39.235
What boat is carrying drugs,
which ones is guns.

39:39.613 --> 39:43.950
I'm gonna tell you who's
going to get cut up and why.

39:43.951 --> 39:47.245
What I got to know is,

39:47.246 --> 39:48.577
if and when I do this,

39:50.457 --> 39:52.875
if I wear your dog collar,

39:52.876 --> 39:56.963
are y'all gonna do what's right by me and
keep my head from getting shot the fuck up

39:56.964 --> 39:59.387
so I can go see my family again?

40:02.553 --> 40:05.596
'Cause the truth is, y'all need me.

40:05.597 --> 40:09.559
Y'all ain't got enough cops with
enough sense or enough time

40:09.560 --> 40:12.353
to clear them crimes that
already been committed

40:12.354 --> 40:14.398
and, as you well know,
the ones that will be.

40:16.567 --> 40:20.365
I'm the one with the
devil's address here.

40:21.029 --> 40:22.780
Okay, great.

40:22.781 --> 40:24.532
Thanks.

40:24.533 --> 40:28.369
Thank you, Mr Weiland, for that.

40:28.370 --> 40:31.224
- And thank you, everyone, for being here...
- And why are we here?

40:31.540 --> 40:36.632
And why are we focused on white power
prison gangs beyond prosecution?

40:37.921 --> 40:41.091
I don't see how ATF's got any
long-term interest in this.

40:43.886 --> 40:45.431
Hold the phone, gentlemen.

40:47.055 --> 40:49.348
Their sophisticated,
criminal network

40:49.349 --> 40:53.060
was born of a racist ideology
in the prison system.

40:53.061 --> 40:54.562
Let's be clear.

40:54.563 --> 40:57.273
They do not discriminate.

40:57.274 --> 41:01.444
Their ruthless violence
extends to everyone.

41:01.445 --> 41:03.405
Yeah, I'm afraid he's right.

41:05.365 --> 41:06.949
There's no one off limits.

41:06.950 --> 41:08.326
Sure. Yeah, sure. I...

41:08.327 --> 41:11.746
John, if I may interject here
and speak freely for a second.

41:11.747 --> 41:16.626
From a budgetary standpoint, I don't see
how Mr Weiland has enough to offer us

41:16.627 --> 41:19.295
that would warrant sponsorship
or anything of the sort.

41:19.296 --> 41:20.674
There's a list.

41:23.133 --> 41:24.630
I'm sorry, what?

41:27.930 --> 41:30.223
There's a hit list.

41:30.224 --> 41:33.434
There's as much as 12...

41:33.435 --> 41:36.729
Well, might be one or two less now.

41:36.730 --> 41:39.023
A couple of them could
have already been gotten.

41:39.024 --> 41:41.150
Now we're talking.

41:42.569 --> 41:45.988
- And why these 12, Jesse?
- Different reasons.

41:48.242 --> 41:51.744
It ain't so much why or what
they done that matters.

41:53.288 --> 41:59.175
You pick any one of 'em off that list,
they gonna put you on salary.

41:59.753 --> 42:05.011
And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken,
you're Mr Nukes, right?

42:05.467 --> 42:09.551
- First US Attorney, John Nukes.
- That's right.

42:10.097 --> 42:15.651
Well, last time I seen it,
you were number two on that list.

42:20.399 --> 42:23.189
Can you fill us in on the
rest of that list, Jesse?

42:23.610 --> 42:25.025
Yes, I can.

42:28.323 --> 42:29.702
I'll sponsor him.

42:30.617 --> 42:32.785
Jesse's welfare will
come out of our budget.

42:32.786 --> 42:37.415
Anyone with pending cases or leads
for Jesse, see me, I'll loan him out.

42:37.416 --> 42:39.542
Make no mistake, gentlemen.

42:39.543 --> 42:44.837
We will put this criminal
organisation down.

42:48.051 --> 42:52.638
And, Jesse, I'm number
two on that list.

42:52.639 --> 42:54.232
Who the fuck is number one?

43:31.929 --> 43:33.177
Okay.

43:40.854 --> 43:42.945
I don't want to go alone.

43:43.857 --> 43:46.692
You and Tommy,

43:46.693 --> 43:49.615
y'all are everything
in the world to me.

43:52.366 --> 43:55.576
For this to work,
I need you two to be safe.

43:55.577 --> 43:58.285
So I got something to come home to.

44:14.179 --> 44:16.139
JESSE: It ain't forever.

44:16.140 --> 44:18.224
- (CRYING)
- Hey, look at me.

44:18.225 --> 44:20.101
It ain't forever.

44:20.102 --> 44:21.777
Okay.

44:27.330 --> 44:28.798
(CRYING CONTINUES)

44:29.027 --> 44:32.572
- It ain't forever, baby.
- Okay.

44:32.573 --> 44:34.741
- Okay.
- All right?

44:34.742 --> 44:36.915
- I need you to be strong.
- Okay.

44:49.339 --> 44:52.130
LYNN: I love you.
- I love you.

45:13.906 --> 45:15.747
Let's go to work.

45:18.577 --> 45:21.829
LUTIN: "Blood in, blood out."
That's the oath we made.

45:21.830 --> 45:24.585
Them the bones that made us
survive inside the joint.

45:25.834 --> 45:29.716
Any man can live or die violently.

45:30.005 --> 45:33.721
You ride with the brand,
you die with the brand.

45:39.640 --> 45:43.687
I got a safe cracking job
I want you to run point on.

45:46.522 --> 45:49.524
I'll be honest with you.

45:49.525 --> 45:53.075
I was kind of hoping
for something bigger.

45:55.322 --> 45:57.865
What do you got in mind?

45:57.866 --> 46:01.661
How about a couple of
them names off that list?

46:01.662 --> 46:04.539
We got guys to do that. What
you wanna go back to that for?

46:04.540 --> 46:06.749
'Cause I miss the action.
(CHUCKLES)

46:07.835 --> 46:12.215
Besides, that's where
the money's at.

46:16.343 --> 46:17.721
What do you say?

46:18.679 --> 46:23.059

and then I'll let you get a taste.

48:02.241 --> 48:04.659
Dave Moore's trial
starts next week.

48:04.660 --> 48:06.619
A juror has reached out.

48:06.620 --> 48:09.831
He wants six grand up front
and a job at $400 a week.

48:09.832 --> 48:13.797
That'll guarantee a hung jury
plus a push for an acquittal.

48:14.169 --> 48:15.753
- $300.
- $300.

48:15.754 --> 48:18.005
We'll give him a no-show
at the trucking firm.

48:18.006 --> 48:20.299
(CHUCKLING) That's great.

Escrow on the buildings
in southeast Florida

48:28.058 --> 48:30.393
that Morris introduced
to us is closed.

48:30.394 --> 48:31.519
We've sold every unit.

48:31.520 --> 48:35.984
We should see revenues of $1.4 million
over our original projections.

48:36.046 --> 48:37.878
Whoo-dee-whoo!
(LAUGHS)

48:38.360 --> 48:41.863
And lastly, our friends that Morris
introduced us to in the Middle East,

48:41.864 --> 48:44.031
they put a final
offer on the table.

48:44.032 --> 48:49.540
They will fund our operations in Louisiana
if we agree to act on their behalf.

48:50.330 --> 48:52.206
All right. Close the deal.

48:52.207 --> 48:53.622

48:59.256 --> 49:00.504

49:02.426 --> 49:06.846
JESSE: Lutin's partners Edgar Billings
and Gerald Kaye are in charge of the list.

49:06.847 --> 49:09.724
The hits are coming
out of New Orleans.

49:09.725 --> 49:12.266
Lutin gets the orders and
then he farms 'em out.

49:12.770 --> 49:13.895
That's what I got.

49:13.896 --> 49:19.192
If you can just get a direct order
from Lutin to you, on a wire...

49:19.193 --> 49:20.318
A wire?

49:20.319 --> 49:24.697
He just went back to work and you
want him to wear a fucking wire?

Put a tap on that goddamn lawyer's
phone, that's what you should do.

49:27.659 --> 49:30.203
He's an attorney, Carter. Anything
we get would be inadmissible.

49:30.204 --> 49:32.747
It's information, Fitch.

49:32.748 --> 49:34.749
What's that other deal?

49:34.750 --> 49:39.794
Well, Lutin's got this lobbyist
from D.C. in his pocket.

49:40.422 --> 49:45.135
And he's been brokering all kinds
of lucrative deals for him.

49:46.053 --> 49:48.345
And he's got a group
of sand niggers.

49:49.723 --> 49:52.266
Arabs from the Middle East.

49:52.267 --> 49:55.103
They got a truckload
of guns for us.

- What group?
- Libyans.

49:57.940 --> 49:59.532
A truckload?

50:02.236 --> 50:03.778
All right, Jesse, you know what?

50:03.779 --> 50:06.739
We're gonna need a little time on this.
I'll have to take a look. Okay?

50:06.740 --> 50:08.282
This has got to be now.

50:08.283 --> 50:11.994
