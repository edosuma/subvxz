l did not kill anyone.

l also shouted instructions
on how to get out

My guess,
he's either deeply depressed

32:38.040 --> 32:42.043
or an icicle has
snapped off his roof
and impaled his brain.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.338
He has this terrible habit
of standing directly
underneath them

32:45.422 --> 32:46.631
and staring up at them.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.758
And l always say,
"Michael, take two steps back

32:48.842 --> 32:50.551
"and stare at the icicle
from the side."

32:50.636 --> 32:52.345
And he's like,
"No, l like the way they look

32:52.429 --> 32:55.640
"from standing
directly underneath them."

32:55.724 --> 32:57.933
lt was only a matter of time.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.519
Michael is so dumb

33:00.604 --> 33:04.774
that he tries to
put his M&M's
in alphabetical order.

33:04.858 --> 33:05.816

33:05.901 --> 33:08.611
All right, Kevin,
enough with
the Michael jokes.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.112

bad enough yesterday.

Attention, everyone,
l've just got
a text from Michael.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.621
He says "personnel day."
Are we hiring?

33:18.705 --> 33:20.331
Yeah. You're being replaced.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.166
l think he meant
personal day.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.501
l don't know.
That's quite a leap, Pam.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.503
l hope he's okay.
l feel bad.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.546
Give it up. He's dead.

33:27.631 --> 33:28.964

33:51.613 --> 33:54.740
You know, sometimes
to get perspective,

33:55.867 --> 33:59.704
l like to think about
a spaceman on a star
incredibly far away,

34:00.872 --> 34:02.915
and our problems don't
matter to him

34:02.999 --> 34:05.751
because we're just
a distant point of light.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.130
But he feels sorry for me

34:09.840 --> 34:12.299
because he has
an incredibly
powerful microscope

34:12.384 --> 34:14.301
and he can see my face.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.973

No, l'm not.

Was it my fault?
