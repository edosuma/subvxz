<i>[Callie] Previously on The Fosters...</i>

00:01.172 --> 00:03.035
<i>- [Wyatt] You look good.
- How would you know?</i>

00:03.036 --> 00:04.169
<i>[Dani] Well, if she
starts seeing him again,</i>

00:04.270 --> 00:05.805
<i>you only have yourself to blame.</i>

00:05.906 --> 00:08.273
You have to convince her it's not too late.

00:08.374 --> 00:10.175
- We are trying to have a baby.
- And we have a donor.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.111
- It's Timothy.
- We want all of you to be on board.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.113
<i>- Really important to Mama.
- [Jesus] How about your car keys?</i>

00:14.214 --> 00:15.547
<i>- [Emma] Jesus...
- [Jesus] He's drunk!</i>

00:15.649 --> 00:17.483
Mind your own business.

00:17.584 --> 00:20.152
Let him go! He's not driving, ok? I am.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.988
- Just stay away from me.
- Mom, are you ok? Let's go home.

00:23.089 --> 00:26.425
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- Zac, your son.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.661
<i>[Man] Can you think of any reason
someone would go through all this trouble</i>

00:29.762 --> 00:31.096
to make this fake ID and
plant it in your purse?

00:31.197 --> 00:33.132
All I have to do is
tell them you set her up

00:33.233 --> 00:34.933
- because I bought back the IDs.
- What IDs?

00:35.034 --> 00:37.469
The kids we sold to aren't gonna
talk. It's your word against mine.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.471
- I know who did this.
- Oh yeah, who?

00:39.572 --> 00:42.907
- It was me.
- Don't do this, Brandon.

00:43.009 --> 00:46.311
[Ana] Stefanie Foster? Your son
gave me money to change my story

00:46.412 --> 00:48.913
to say that I wasn't there the
night that your partner killed Evan.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.383
- You're out of your mind.
- I want 10,000 dollars.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.318
Then you'll never see me again.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.524
- [Mike] What?
- I gave the money to Ana so she'd change her story.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.627
- I was...
- Wait, wait, wait. You bribed her?

01:02.727 --> 01:06.364
No, it wasn't... I just wanted her to...

01:06.465 --> 01:07.965
- To lie?
- No, she was already lying.

01:08.066 --> 01:13.037
I just wanted to make sure Dad
didn't go to prison or something.

01:13.138 --> 01:15.339
- Does anyone know about this?
- No.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.774
- No one?
- No one.

01:16.875 --> 01:19.777
Ok, you cannot tell
anyone about this, Brandon.

01:19.878 --> 01:23.314
Not until we figure out what
to do. Do you understand?

01:23.415 --> 01:26.450
- Yeah, yes.
- I mean it, I'm serious.

01:26.552 --> 01:29.187
This could end up very
badly if this gets out.

01:33.091 --> 01:35.326
Ok.

01:35.427 --> 01:37.761
I'm sorry.

01:38.930 --> 01:43.167
I was... really trying to help.

01:54.679 --> 01:57.180
Well, at least no one knows.

01:57.281 --> 02:01.084
- Ana does.
- So?

02:01.185 --> 02:03.753
So, she came to me the other day and

02:03.854 --> 02:08.225
threatened to go to the DA with
it, unless I give her money.

02:08.326 --> 02:09.892
- You're kidding.
- Ten thousand.

02:09.993 --> 02:11.794
Why is this the first
time I'm hearing about it?

02:11.895 --> 02:14.931
Because she said, "Your
son gave me a bribe."

02:15.032 --> 02:16.799
And I just assumed it was Jesus.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.135
I asked him, he had no idea
what I was talking about.

02:19.237 --> 02:21.404
- It never occurred to me...
- It could be Brandon?

02:21.505 --> 02:23.740
So what are we going to do?

02:23.841 --> 02:26.175
You can't pay the woman, that's a crime.

02:26.277 --> 02:28.877
And what's to stop her
from going to the DA anyway?

02:28.978 --> 02:31.880
Or coming back again and
again and demanding more.

02:31.981 --> 02:35.183
We have to do something. Because
if she goes to the DA with it,

02:35.285 --> 02:37.720
he'll think that you put Brandon up to it.

02:37.820 --> 02:41.290
They'll reopen the case and
he'll use it against you.

02:41.391 --> 02:43.425
That freakin' woman, I could kill her.

02:43.526 --> 02:45.728
Hey, take it easy.

02:46.829 --> 02:48.530
Ok.

02:48.722 --> 02:51.189
So, how do we make this go away?

02:53.827 --> 02:56.362
Well, "we" are not going to do anything.

02:56.463 --> 02:59.130
You are going to stay as far
away from that woman as possible.

02:59.232 --> 03:02.167
I will handle Ana, ok?

03:03.503 --> 03:04.970
Ok.

03:08.941 --> 03:11.276
I want Brandon to come home.

03:18.017 --> 03:21.086
<i>* It's not where you come from *</i>

03:21.187 --> 03:24.455
<i>* It's where you belong *</i>

03:24.556 --> 03:26.824
<i>* Nothing I would trade *</i>

03:26.926 --> 03:30.461
<i>* I wouldn't have it any other way *</i>

03:30.562 --> 03:35.800
<i>* You're surrounded by
love and you're wanted *</i>

03:35.902 --> 03:39.404
<i>* So never feel alone *</i>

03:39.505 --> 03:41.672
<i>* You're at home with me *</i>

03:41.774 --> 03:44.909
<i>* Right where you belong *</i>

03:55.120 --> 03:57.855
- [Mike] You didn't think I was gonna find out?
- No, Mike.

03:57.956 --> 04:01.392
I was worried about you. You
have had such a hard time lately.

04:01.493 --> 04:05.262
And Brandon, he didn't want to upset
you, ok? So I did a stupid thing.

04:05.363 --> 04:07.965
- Yeah, you did.
- I did it to protect you.

04:08.066 --> 04:10.735
- Protect me? From what?
- I was worried about your sobriety.

04:10.836 --> 04:12.336
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

04:12.438 --> 04:13.838
I don't need that kind of protection.

04:13.939 --> 04:17.040
Because of you, Stef is
making him move back home.

04:17.141 --> 04:21.377
- She can't do that.
- She can! She has custody. She can do whatever she wants.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.916
- Get out.
- What?

04:26.016 --> 04:28.485
- Get out! We're done!
- Please!

04:28.586 --> 04:31.588
You know what? No. You can get your
stuff tomorrow. Get out of here.

04:50.808 --> 04:54.310
I've told Mike that Brandon is coming home.

04:54.411 --> 04:56.346
Do you think he's ready for
that after what he did tonight?

04:56.447 --> 04:58.047
He's going to have to be.

04:58.148 --> 05:00.249
The whole confession
was a lie anyway, Lena.

05:00.351 --> 05:02.518
The part about him setting
up Callie was a lie,

05:02.619 --> 05:04.253
but the rest of it? I'm not so sure.

05:04.355 --> 05:06.822
Well, Callie and Jude are
being adopted on Monday.

05:06.923 --> 05:08.858
So he's got to get over it. Now.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.694
Why was he selling fake IDs to
begin with? I don't understand it.

05:11.795 --> 05:14.797
What could he possibly
need that much money for?

05:22.806 --> 05:24.940
Good news is we didn't have to arrest him.

05:26.176 --> 05:28.644
What about school? What's
Sanchez going to do?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.980
I gave her the names Brandon gave you.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.049
Maybe one of them will give up Vico.

05:33.150 --> 05:35.350
But I'm pretty sure that
she's going to expel him.

05:37.987 --> 05:39.921
What happened to our son?

05:40.756 --> 05:42.557
[Lena] I don't know.

05:52.428 --> 05:54.262
Mariana. Good morning.

05:54.363 --> 05:56.030
Good morning, Mrs. Rogers.

05:56.131 --> 05:57.932
Hi...

05:58.033 --> 06:03.505
Hey, honey. I will let you
two snugglebugs alone. Ok.

06:07.310 --> 06:10.144
She seems... ok today.

06:10.246 --> 06:12.180
Yeah.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.282
But last night...

06:15.818 --> 06:17.686
she didn't even know who you were.

06:17.786 --> 06:19.654
Does that happen a lot?

06:19.755 --> 06:22.724
I don't know. Sometimes.

06:22.825 --> 06:26.560
And sometimes she thinks you're your dad.

06:27.329 --> 06:29.363
Yeah.

06:29.464 --> 06:32.333
Look, Zac. She needs to get some help,

06:32.434 --> 06:35.035
- she needs to see a doctor.
- You don't understand.

06:36.671 --> 06:38.839
What?

06:41.943 --> 06:44.278
She...

06:46.214 --> 06:48.749
she has Alzheimer's.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.518
She what?

06:51.620 --> 06:53.454
She's so young.

06:53.555 --> 06:55.589
It's called early onset or something.

06:55.690 --> 06:57.824
She's not even that bad yet.

06:57.925 --> 07:02.329
I mean, this is why I didn't
want us to start dating.

07:02.430 --> 07:05.466
I just really need to
take care of her right now.

07:07.501 --> 07:09.369
But who's going to take care of you?

07:12.406 --> 07:17.110
Look, besides, if she gets
put into a home or something,

07:17.211 --> 07:19.712
they'll make me go live with my dad.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.315
So I'd have to leave you.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.851
And I really don't want to leave you.

07:41.835 --> 07:43.936
So I will get you the money.

07:44.037 --> 07:48.140
Meet me tomorrow at the diner
on Alavera at three. You know it?

07:49.242 --> 07:50.943
But on one condition.

07:51.044 --> 07:54.814
Once I give it to you, you are
out of our lives forever, ok?

07:56.516 --> 07:58.650
- Ok.
- I mean it.

08:00.821 --> 08:03.722
I get you that 10,000 and I
never want to see you again.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.935
- [phone rings]
- Open the chest.

08:17.036 --> 08:19.705
[game beeps]

08:20.640 --> 08:22.341
Jude, you have a phone call.

08:22.442 --> 08:24.543
I do? Who is it?

08:24.644 --> 08:26.511
I don't know.

08:28.648 --> 08:30.549
Hello?

08:33.952 --> 08:37.120
It's a girl. Who do you think it is?

08:38.590 --> 08:41.191
Yeah. Ok...

08:41.292 --> 08:43.961
I have to ask my moms first.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.431
Who's Jude talking to on the phone?

08:47.532 --> 08:49.533
He looks all nervous and twitchy.

08:49.634 --> 08:51.369
I don't know. Some girl.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.937
Maybe you could give him some advice?

08:54.038 --> 08:57.274
Me? Advice on girls? Yeah,
that's not a good idea.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.844
What do you mean? Smooth operator like you?

09:00.944 --> 09:04.748
Well, Emma seems to think I'm more
of a jackass than a Jack of Hearts.

09:04.849 --> 09:06.383
She's not even talking to me.

09:06.484 --> 09:09.686
- Why?
- I got up in Kyle's face at the dance.

09:12.122 --> 09:16.693
- What?
- Well, you kind of have been a jerk lately.

09:16.794 --> 09:21.498
I know you hate it when I get all sisterly
on you and I give you advice and stuff,

09:21.599 --> 09:24.200
and I know how much you really
wanted to get off your meds,

09:24.301 --> 09:26.836
but I gotta tell you,

09:26.937 --> 09:29.806
I kind of want my brother back.

09:31.974 --> 09:35.711
- Who was that?
- Maddie from school.

09:35.812 --> 09:38.514
Maddie? What did she want?

09:38.615 --> 09:43.685
Um... she just wanted to know if I wanted
to go see a movie with her next week.

09:43.787 --> 09:45.788
She did?

09:45.889 --> 09:47.423
What did you say?

09:47.524 --> 09:52.795
I said I would ask my moms and
let her know at school tomorrow.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.996
Do you want to go, like...

09:55.097 --> 09:57.098
do you like her?

09:58.167 --> 10:01.036
No. No.

10:01.137 --> 10:03.371
Not like that. No.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.641
Are you sure?

10:05.742 --> 10:07.942
Yeah. Yeah, no.

10:11.046 --> 10:13.981
Then is it ok if I ask her out?

10:19.387 --> 10:21.322
Um...

10:22.624 --> 10:25.159
Yeah. Sure.

10:37.673 --> 10:40.107
So, I talked to your mom.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.376
She's fine if you wanna go back tomorrow,

10:42.478 --> 10:44.678
so you can work on your
audition and focus...

10:45.847 --> 10:47.948
Dad.

10:48.049 --> 10:50.284
I'm really sorry.

10:50.385 --> 10:52.486
For everything.

10:52.587 --> 10:55.055
- Didn't think...
- No.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.257
No, you didn't.

10:57.359 --> 11:00.427
And I've never been so
disappointed, Brandon.

11:13.074 --> 11:15.509
So you read the donor contract?

11:15.610 --> 11:19.213
I did, I did. And...

11:20.548 --> 11:22.749
I don't think I can sign it.

11:24.719 --> 11:27.453
I really thought I could do this,

11:27.555 --> 11:30.790
but when I actually read the
contract, and saw it all laid out...

11:30.892 --> 11:34.794
I couldn't get past the idea that
there would be this kid in the world

11:34.896 --> 11:38.899
that came from me, who I wouldn't get to

11:39.000 --> 11:42.068
love or hold or play with.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.070
I...

11:47.041 --> 11:49.543
I think it would just destroy me.

11:52.747 --> 11:54.414
I'm sorry.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.953
- What if you're already pregnant?
- I know, I know that.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.156
That's why I stopped to get a blood
test at Urgent Care on my way home.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.825
- And?
- It's not instant, honey.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.194
It's going to take 24 hours.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.099
Ok, this is what I was worried
about. Using a donor that we know.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.202
We should never have inseminated
before he signed that contract.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.137
Are you saying this is my fault?

12:19.238 --> 12:22.240
Because you were the one who agreed that
we should do it while I was ovulating.

12:22.341 --> 12:25.444
Yeah, because it was pretty obvious
how much you wanted to do it.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.112
Ok.

12:30.617 --> 12:34.419
Let's just hope that...
that you're not pregnant.

12:40.159 --> 12:44.563
Stef, if you don't... want me to
have a baby, you need to say it.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.239
I don't want you to have a baby, Lena.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.481
Honey...

13:02.582 --> 13:04.015
[sighs]

13:37.651 --> 13:39.252
Hey.

13:41.322 --> 13:43.823
So we're getting adopted tomorrow,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.658
and after that, there's...

13:46.759 --> 13:51.630
no, you know, going back.

13:51.731 --> 13:55.334
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah and I just feel ever since I got here,

13:55.435 --> 13:58.304
- I've been ruining your life.
- No, Callie, no.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.105
- I don't want to do that.
- You're not.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.007
Really?

14:03.776 --> 14:06.678
Brandon, I want this.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.948
I want to be a part of
this family more than

14:09.049 --> 14:11.483
I have ever wanted
anything in my whole life.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.853
If there is one thing that
can make me blow this all up,

it's knowing that I'm hurting you.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.160
Am I?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.329
Hurting you?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.798
No.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.300
Are you sure?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.371
Yeah.

[toilet flushing]

14:51.056 --> 14:54.192
Lena? Honey?

14:56.829 --> 15:00.098
You'll be happy to hear
that I just got my period.

15:09.107 --> 15:10.841
Honey, I'm sorry.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.846
I am not happy, I'm
sorry about what I said...

15:15.947 --> 15:20.785
I know how much you want this and I
want you to have everything you wanted,

15:20.886 --> 15:24.488
but when I think about a baby,
a little tiny helpless person,

15:24.589 --> 15:26.824
I get so overwhelmed.

15:26.925 --> 15:29.527
The kids are all having a
rough time, one way or another,

15:29.628 --> 15:32.797
and every time they make a
mistake, I feel like it's my fault.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.599
Like, I'm screwing this
up, I'm screwing them up.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.836
They're just teenagers. They're
just making teenage mistakes.

15:42.641 --> 15:46.877
Remember you asked me why Brandon
needed all that money from the IDs?

15:48.279 --> 15:50.347
He used it to bribe Ana.

15:50.448 --> 15:55.018
- Ana? Not the twins' Ana.
- So Mike wouldn't go to jail.

15:55.119 --> 15:58.655
And Ana, being the delightful
person that she is, showed up

15:58.756 --> 16:03.526
and demanded 10,000 dollars from
us or she would go to the DA.

16:05.663 --> 16:08.865
So, what are we gonna do?
You're not gonna pay her.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.567
No, I'm not gonna pay her.

16:10.668 --> 16:15.805
I'm going to wear a wire and record
her trying to extort a police officer.

[Dani] Hello?

16:31.889 --> 16:33.289
Yeah?

16:36.059 --> 16:38.260
Brandon...

16:46.203 --> 16:48.937
- Callie came by.
- Oh, no.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.409
What happened?

16:53.510 --> 16:57.046
- She's over me.
- You poor thing.

16:57.147 --> 16:58.680
What are you doing?

17:00.350 --> 17:02.651
Isn't your audition tomorrow?

17:02.752 --> 17:04.953
Yeah.

17:05.055 --> 17:09.557
Well, I'm not going to let
you blow it. It's time for bed.

17:22.003 --> 17:23.838
Sit.

17:23.939 --> 17:28.042
- Take off your pants.
- Wow. Bossy.

17:33.749 --> 17:36.817
- Where's your phone?
- In my pants.

17:36.919 --> 17:40.121
I want to set your alarm.

17:41.557 --> 17:45.026
So you can't hit snooze, ok?
I don't want you missing this.

17:46.561 --> 17:50.830
I'm sorry... about everything.

17:50.932 --> 17:54.268
You know? My dad.

17:55.937 --> 17:57.837
It's ok.

17:57.939 --> 18:00.040
It's not your fault.

18:04.879 --> 18:08.582
[sighs] Sucks about
Callie. You deserve better.

18:08.683 --> 18:11.017
Before you know it,
you're going to find her,

18:11.119 --> 18:13.753
someone who appreciates

18:13.854 --> 18:18.592
just how kind and amazing

18:18.693 --> 18:20.794

It's... look, I know it's
kind of weird that I'm calling.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.855
But I just got a message from
my dad that he left last night,

20:28.957 --> 20:31.792
and he sounded super drunk,

20:31.893 --> 20:36.730
and he's not home yet and
I'm kind of freaking out.

20:36.831 --> 20:40.000
Uh, have you seen him?

20:40.101 --> 20:44.871
If you hear from him, or anything,
will you let me know? Thanks.

Um... Yeah. They said it was ok.

21:00.287 --> 21:01.821
Ok, cool.

21:06.427 --> 21:07.860
I thought you said you didn't like her.

21:07.962 --> 21:11.197
- So I changed my mind.
- You only like her 'cause I said I do.

21:11.298 --> 21:13.566
No, that's not it.

21:14.801 --> 21:17.135
It doesn't matter. She doesn't like you.

21:17.236 --> 21:20.272
- She likes me.
- Yeah, whatever.

You know what? I don't think I can
come to your adoption thing today

out with that Kyle jerk?

23:04.375 --> 23:06.843

- Why do you think?

23:09.213 --> 23:11.582
No.

23:17.622 --> 23:18.956
Can we start over?

- I don't know.
- Really?

You're gonna be like that?

It's my fault you set up Callie?

hit you where it hurt.

24:13.876 --> 24:17.346
Well, nice. Now we're both
gonna get kicked out of school.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.259
What do you mean?

25:40.360 --> 25:43.996
There's this... this
girl at school, Maddie,

25:44.097 --> 25:47.565
and Connor wanted to go out with her,

25:47.666 --> 25:53.505
and I got all, kind of, jealous, I guess.

25:53.606 --> 25:56.574
Ok. That happens.

25:57.843 --> 26:02.514
But I don't think I'm jealous about Maddie.

26:04.617 --> 26:06.518
Oh, honey.

26:06.619 --> 26:10.021
That's... totally normal.

26:10.122 --> 26:12.791
Not normal, that's not what I mean.

26:12.892 --> 26:16.694
Let's not use the word normal at all.

26:16.796 --> 26:21.098
Honey, everybody gets jealous when their
friend gets a boyfriend or girlfriend.

26:21.199 --> 26:22.634
Everybody.

26:22.735 --> 26:27.472
And it doesn't necessarily mean
that you're gay or that you're not.

26:27.573 --> 26:30.107
And if you are or you're not,

26:30.208 --> 26:32.811

what because you're you.

I know. Ok.

26:45.491 --> 26:48.893
- I'm going to go get changed.
- Ok.

26:51.763 --> 26:57.468
She was doing some ironing
and came into my room.

26:57.569 --> 27:02.005
And she didn't know who I was.

27:02.106 --> 27:04.074

27:04.175 --> 27:08.411
She started screaming and I tried
to get the iron out of her hands,

and she, um...

27:10.548 --> 27:13.216
she hit me.

worse or somebody else or herself.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.627
they saw her get in a

29:24.917 --> 29:28.654
Hey, I'm here! This is so exciting.

29:28.755 --> 29:31.323
Hi, babies. All right, let's do this.

29:31.424 --> 29:33.158
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

29:33.260 --> 29:34.926
Yeah.

29:40.767 --> 29:42.268
So, how'd it go with Sanchez?

29:42.369 --> 29:45.036
Gonna have to start looking
for new schools for Brandon?

29:45.138 --> 29:46.604
No, thank God, but...

29:46.705 --> 29:49.141
But what? She's not expelling
him. That's great, right?

29:49.242 --> 29:52.144
Of course, but she's also not
going to do anything about Vico.

29:52.245 --> 29:55.313
- There's something wrong with that kid.
- Really?

29:55.414 --> 29:57.615
Yeah, this is why this
entire thing will go away.

29:57.716 --> 30:01.352
Because Sanchez is afraid of Vico's
parents. It just makes me furious.

30:01.453 --> 30:06.557
[sighs] So, did you meet with Ana?

30:06.659 --> 30:09.261
Uh, no. She didn't show.

30:09.361 --> 30:11.496
She wasn't at the halfway
house when I went there after.

30:11.597 --> 30:12.931
They said she never came home last night.

30:13.032 --> 30:17.803
So, now I'll have to wait
till she shows up again.

30:22.207 --> 30:24.108
[sighing] Listen, are we ok?

30:24.209 --> 30:27.812
I... I said some things yesterday
that I know hurt your feelings.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.281
I thought about what you said,

30:30.381 --> 30:34.118
and I think you're right.

30:35.887 --> 30:38.989
We've got all these beautiful kids and...

30:40.225 --> 30:42.559
they need us right now.

- Really?
- Really.

30:50.836 --> 30:53.403
Uh, it's just...

30:55.140 --> 30:59.809
I heard back from Urgent Care and...

30:59.910 --> 31:03.646
I didn't start my period.
It was just spotting...

31:05.782 --> 31:07.917
because I'm pregnant.

31:17.394 --> 31:20.396
I thought when I heard
those words I would feel...

31:21.899 --> 31:24.600
I don't know what I thought I'd feel but...

31:28.172 --> 31:32.775
I feel nothing but love
right now, baby... [sobs]

31:32.877 --> 31:38.646
Love for you and for this
beautiful baby we're going to have.

31:40.616 --> 31:43.085
Oh, my God...

31:46.055 --> 31:47.789
Oh, baby.

31:47.891 --> 31:50.058
I'm so happy.

31:53.796 --> 31:57.565
- You ok?
- Yeah, it's just...

31:57.666 --> 32:00.702
it looks like Zac is going to have
to move in with his dad for awhile.

32:00.803 --> 32:04.672
- Oh, yeah?
- In Arizona.

32:04.774 --> 32:06.608
Oh.

32:07.743 --> 32:10.712
- That sucks.
- It's ok.

32:10.813 --> 32:14.215
- I just want him to be safe.
- Yeah, of course you do.

32:14.316 --> 32:18.352
But you finally get a boyfriend and...

32:18.453 --> 32:20.922
And yeah.

32:21.023 --> 32:22.924
I just...

32:23.025 --> 32:26.360
I feel like everyone
I love ends up leaving.

32:26.461 --> 32:28.129
Hey...

32:28.230 --> 32:30.331
That's not true.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.369
Hey.

32:38.606 --> 32:41.542
- You didn't have to come.
- Are you kidding me?

32:41.643 --> 32:44.245
And look who I found outside.

32:45.346 --> 32:48.882
- What? Hi!
- Damn girl, it's adoption day!

32:48.983 --> 32:51.752
We're so happy for you
and I'm so proud of you.

32:51.853 --> 32:53.554
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:53.655 --> 32:55.188
Can I talk to you for a sec?

32:55.289 --> 32:56.857
- Yeah.
- Sure.

32:56.958 --> 32:58.492
Over here.

33:02.997 --> 33:05.432
[Connor] Hey.

33:05.533 --> 33:10.169
Hey, you got my message?
I wasn't sure you'd come.

33:10.270 --> 33:13.840
Well, it's for family and friends, right?

33:13.941 --> 33:18.143
Um, I'm sorry about the whole
Maddie thing. If you like her...

33:18.244 --> 33:20.045
No, I don't know.

33:20.146 --> 33:23.315
Maybe all three of us can
go see a movie sometime?

33:24.585 --> 33:26.953
- Hey, Connor.
- Hey, Callie.

33:27.053 --> 33:29.522
I can't believe this is about to happen.

33:29.623 --> 33:31.423
We're about to get adopted.

33:33.026 --> 33:35.060
Hey, guys. Hey Connor, how are you?

33:35.161 --> 33:37.429
- Hey.
- Can we talk to you for a sec?

33:37.530 --> 33:38.730
Yeah.

33:46.439 --> 33:48.374
So, there's...

33:49.775 --> 33:54.346
there's a problem with the
adoption, with Callie's paperwork.

33:55.348 --> 33:56.915
What? What is it?

33:57.017 --> 34:01.120
The court needed your
original birth certificate.

34:01.221 --> 34:03.454
There were only duplicates
in your foster care file.

34:03.556 --> 34:06.725
And when they got yours...

34:07.927 --> 34:10.594
there was a different
name listed for father.

34:13.565 --> 34:18.335
So, Donald isn't my dad?

34:18.437 --> 34:21.304
Not according to the birth certificate...

34:21.407 --> 34:23.274
It says, Robert Quinn?

34:23.375 --> 34:25.275
Does that name mean anything to you?

34:25.377 --> 34:28.513
Um... well, Quinn is my middle name.

34:28.614 --> 34:33.051
But Mom told me it was a family name, so...

34:35.320 --> 34:36.688
What does this mean?

34:36.789 --> 34:38.989
We don't... really know.

34:39.090 --> 34:40.958
[Stef] We'll talk to Donald.

34:41.059 --> 34:42.492
See what he knows.

34:42.594 --> 34:47.531
We'll figure something out, I promise. Ok?

34:48.567 --> 34:49.934
But until then...

34:50.034 --> 34:52.202
I'm not getting adopted.

34:52.303 --> 34:57.608
Not today, but you are getting
adopted, Callie. We promise.

34:57.709 --> 35:01.178
Well, I'm not getting adopted without you.

35:01.279 --> 35:05.182
No, Jude. We have waited
too long for this day, ok?

35:05.283 --> 35:06.850
- I'm not going to let you do this.
- But...

35:06.952 --> 35:11.754
No, it's ok. It's ok.
Hey, I'm ok, all right?

35:13.057 --> 35:14.924
Today is your day.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.427
And you are going to
walk into that courtroom

35:17.528 --> 35:22.932
and officially, officially, officially

35:23.033 --> 35:25.569
become a member of this family, ok?

35:25.669 --> 35:27.170
- Ok.
- Ok?

35:27.271 --> 35:30.240
- Ok.
- Ok. Ok.

35:30.341 --> 35:33.943
[Callie sniffles] Yeah. Here we go, ok?

35:34.044 --> 35:35.945
I'm just going to step
out and get some air.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.982
- Callie...
- I'll be back in a minute.

35:42.353 --> 35:44.253
[Brandon] What happened?

35:45.522 --> 35:48.023
- It's a really good thing.
- What did you wear?

35:48.125 --> 35:49.492
- I love your dress.
- Oh, thank you.

35:51.328 --> 35:53.695
Callie? Hey! Hey!

35:53.796 --> 35:57.065
Callie? What's going on?
What happened in there? What?

35:57.167 --> 36:00.436
I, um... I can't get adopted.

36:00.537 --> 36:03.572
Apparently, there's something
wrong with my birth certificate.

36:03.673 --> 36:05.107
I feel like...

36:05.207 --> 36:06.541
nothing...

36:08.511 --> 36:10.645
nothing ever works out, you know?

36:10.746 --> 36:14.149
Like the whole freakin'
universe is against me.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.985
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Cal.

36:19.388 --> 36:22.223
The universe isn't against anybody.

36:22.324 --> 36:24.292
I know it feels that way right now,

36:24.393 --> 36:28.396
but I'm telling you,
that's not how it works.

36:30.466 --> 36:32.133
Life is a mixed bag.

36:32.234 --> 36:37.337
We all get some good
and we all get some bad.

36:39.041 --> 36:42.109
The more time that you spend
figuring out all the ways

36:42.210 --> 36:44.078
that the world is trying to screw with you?

36:44.179 --> 36:47.381
Well, the more you're going to find.

36:47.482 --> 36:51.185
Listen, this sucks. I know. Big time.

36:51.286 --> 36:52.953
And I don't know how this is going to end.

36:53.055 --> 36:55.222
I don't know how this is gonna play out.

36:55.323 --> 36:57.058
But I know you.

36:58.526 --> 37:03.097
I know when it gets hard
that you want to run.

37:03.198 --> 37:05.865
But I'm telling you, you got to fight that.

37:05.966 --> 37:11.071
Sometimes you've got to stick around
long enough for your luck to find you.

37:14.041 --> 37:15.308

38:42.927 --> 38:48.431
- It's still true, you know.
- Yeah. I'm ok. Promise.

38:50.501 --> 38:53.303
- I don't know what you're talking about.

[playing down-tempo song]

39:09.420 --> 39:12.488
Think I'm gonna go get
my stuff from my dad's.

39:12.589 --> 39:16.726
- We haven't even cut the cake.
- No, I'll have some later.

39:16.828 --> 39:19.328
Just want to get it done, you know?

39:21.832 --> 39:23.765
- Ok.
- You're getting really good.

39:23.867 --> 39:25.567
I've been practicing.

39:25.668 --> 39:29.305
Maybe we can jam a little
when I get back home.

39:29.405 --> 39:31.273
Yeah, I'd like that.

39:33.910 --> 39:35.644
Wait, Brandon, I forgot.

39:35.745 --> 39:38.447
What happened with the
audition for the symphony?

39:38.548 --> 39:41.383
Oh... I got it.

39:41.484 --> 39:43.352
- You did?
- Yeah.

39:43.453 --> 39:45.955
- That's amazing.
- Thanks.

39:50.227 --> 39:52.061
Ok.

40:20.155 --> 40:22.190
I need to know something.

40:22.291 --> 40:27.996
If you can't or if you're not
going to be able to get adopted,

40:28.097 --> 40:29.663
does that change anything?

40:29.765 --> 40:31.866
About Brandon?

40:33.369 --> 40:35.169
No.

40:36.838 --> 40:39.840
No, it doesn't change anything.

40:57.691 --> 41:01.328
- Play me something.
- Ok.
