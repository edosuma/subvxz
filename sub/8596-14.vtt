WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.379
Previously on "The 100"...

00:05.882 --> 00:07.467
Nightblood.
Luna has it.

00:07.676 --> 00:08.969
That's why we have
to find her.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.096
If she can access
Alie-2...

00:11.304 --> 00:12.389
She can tell us
how to stop Alie-1.

00:12.597 --> 00:13.932
We're not
going with you.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.642
She remembered that
Alie downloaded herself

00:15.850 --> 00:17.102
into the ark mainframe.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.770
If the code
is still there,

00:18.979 --> 00:20.355
we might be able
to find a back door.

00:20.563 --> 00:22.691
Skaikru.
Bringers of death.

00:22.899 --> 00:24.609
Why should we give you
safe passage?

00:24.818 --> 00:26.778
Lincoln.
He sent us.

00:28.655 --> 00:29.489
Luna.

00:29.698 --> 00:30.573
This is
the flame.

00:30.782 --> 00:32.409
It holds the spirit
of Lexa.

00:32.617 --> 00:35.286
Will you take it
and become
the next commander?

00:35.495 --> 00:36.329
No.

00:41.126 --> 00:43.003
It's time to fill
the city of light.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.672
There's no more
need for fighting.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.549
We both know
there's no way in hell

00:47.757 --> 00:49.509
I'm taking
that thing.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.846
You should have killed me
on that battlefield.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.556
He's strong.
We need him

00:54.764 --> 00:57.809
if we're gonna fight
our way out of here.
Listen to me.

00:58.018 --> 00:59.561
Jaha has an army
of chipped soldiers.

00:59.769 --> 01:00.812
That means they're
not gonna stop until

01:01.021 --> 01:03.023
all of us either
join them or die.

01:20.206 --> 01:21.458
Running's not a plan.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.209
It's not running.
It's surviving.

01:23.418 --> 01:25.045
For how long?
This threat

01:25.253 --> 01:26.755
will find us all
eventually.

01:26.963 --> 01:28.173
The boy's right.

01:28.381 --> 01:29.924
We regroup and come
back stronger.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.885
It's a legitimate
battle strategy.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.219
I have
a better one.

01:33.428 --> 01:35.096
Kill their leader--
Jaha.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.975
That's a strategy
I can support.

01:39.184 --> 01:40.685
Unfortunately, he's
not their leader, though.

01:40.894 --> 01:42.520
He's being controlled
just like everyone else

01:42.729 --> 01:43.563
by that--

01:46.316 --> 01:47.192
what?

01:48.318 --> 01:49.194
Nothing.

01:50.862 --> 01:52.614
Never mind.
Just forget it.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.407
John, this isn't
a time for--

02:08.129 --> 02:09.714
Who's ready
to take the key?

02:15.929 --> 02:18.098
None of us is ever gonna
take a key.

02:31.444 --> 02:32.946
We didn't
do this to him.

02:34.697 --> 02:37.450
Someone is unchained.
Find them.

02:59.055 --> 02:59.889
Uhh!

03:00.098 --> 03:01.057
Aah!

03:02.517 --> 03:03.476
Aah! Uhh!

03:08.106 --> 03:09.440
All right.
Come on.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.401
Grab the keys.
She's gonna send
for reinforcements.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.779
You said Jaha
was controlled.

03:14.988 --> 03:16.239
Tell me
what you know.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.116
The smart play here
is going for the tunnels

03:18.324 --> 03:19.367
while we still can,

03:19.576 --> 03:21.286
before we're overrun
by Alie's groupies.

03:21.494 --> 03:23.079
If you have information
that can help us--

03:23.288 --> 03:25.582
we don't have
time for this.
Talk.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.212
Jaha's backpack.

03:31.421 --> 03:32.589
What about it?

03:32.797 --> 03:33.965
All right,
it runs the AI.

03:34.174 --> 03:35.383
And if we destroy it,
I'm pretty sure

03:35.592 --> 03:36.426
we can destroy her.

03:38.595 --> 03:39.679
I know where it is.

03:40.972 --> 03:42.515
I saw them move it
into the temple

03:42.724 --> 03:44.100
before I was
captured.

03:44.309 --> 03:46.978
They'll expect us
to run.

03:47.187 --> 03:49.939
We can use that.
The AI

03:50.148 --> 03:51.983
will follow
those who do,

03:52.192 --> 03:53.776
while we go
for the pack.

03:53.985 --> 03:54.819
We?

03:55.945 --> 03:57.655
I can't
do this alone.

03:57.864 --> 04:00.366
Do you want to save
your people, or not?

04:05.955 --> 04:07.165
Move. Let's go.

04:09.876 --> 04:11.044
What are you
waiting for?

04:15.006 --> 04:16.466
The bad guys are
following them, right?

04:18.176 --> 04:20.094
I may as well take
my chances with you two.

04:22.222 --> 04:23.556
Your father
would be proud.

04:25.183 --> 04:26.517
So, how do
we do it?

04:29.270 --> 04:30.355
Carefully.

04:41.616 --> 04:42.867
I'm sorry.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.577
I didn't anticipate
what they were planning.

04:44.786 --> 04:45.787
It's all right.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.580
You served well.

04:47.789 --> 04:49.415
You're home now.

04:49.624 --> 04:51.626
And besides,
we're already
rounding them up.

04:51.834 --> 04:52.752
The first of
the prisoners

04:52.961 --> 04:54.128
is on the cross
as we speak.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.012
That didn't take long,
did it?

05:03.221 --> 05:04.681
I understand now.

05:06.432 --> 05:07.934
They are going
for the backpack.

05:09.686 --> 05:10.979
Then we delay
the migration.

05:12.438 --> 05:13.690
It's unnecessary.

05:14.941 --> 05:16.359
It's almost
complete.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.320
We'll use
Emori again.

05:22.991 --> 05:24.117
Emori,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.536
you know you can
correct your defects here.

05:28.204 --> 05:31.249
I would,
if I had any.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.834
What can I do
for you, Alie?

05:33.042 --> 05:34.502
Your friend John Murphy

05:34.711 --> 05:36.004
is headed back
to the temple

05:36.212 --> 05:37.255
to do harm.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.299
I need your help
to stop him.

06:18.838 --> 06:21.799
Everywhere I looked,
there were fins.

06:22.008 --> 06:24.469
And teeth.
And blood.

06:24.677 --> 06:28.306
I knew if they saw me,
I'd be next,

06:28.514 --> 06:34.562
so I just floated there,
waiting, praying they'd swim on.

06:34.771 --> 06:35.855
But they didn't.

06:36.064 --> 06:37.273
She's here.

06:37.482 --> 06:38.691
Maybe she changed
her mind.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.653
Finally, I decided.
Live or die.

06:42.862 --> 06:44.280
The boats return
at nightfall.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.282
Then you leave.
Forever.

06:46.491 --> 06:47.533
Luna, let us
explain.

06:47.742 --> 06:49.702
- I said no.
- No, you need to hear this.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.333
There is something
out there

06:55.541 --> 06:58.002
that is going to
destroy us all.

06:58.211 --> 07:00.630
Whatever it is,
it can't reach us here.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.094
It grazed me with its teeth.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.723
We need to talk.

07:13.226 --> 07:14.894
That's my cue.

07:18.022 --> 07:21.984
Rising up from the deep
came something massive.

07:22.193 --> 07:23.903
A huge beast with...

07:24.112 --> 07:25.655
I thought you'd
want this back.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.492
Thank you.

07:31.119 --> 07:32.245
And my sword?

07:32.453 --> 07:34.664
Your weapons will
be on the boat.

07:34.872 --> 07:35.706
Oh.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.044
So much for the great
Luna, the savior

07:40.253 --> 07:42.004
of those in need.

07:42.213 --> 07:43.798
You don't want saving.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.800
You want someone
to fight with you.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.553
Damn right.
We're at war.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.555
Luna, you can't
just ignore that.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.560
Lincoln would've
wanted you
to help us.

07:55.768 --> 07:56.936
By becoming commander?

07:58.146 --> 07:59.772
I don't think so.

07:59.981 --> 08:02.483
Lincoln knew
our rules.

08:02.692 --> 08:05.653
We take people in
who are done fighting.

08:05.862 --> 08:07.947
Done killing.

08:08.156 --> 08:12.827
Look at you.
Fighting is all you know.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.664
Death is all you know.

08:16.873 --> 08:19.625
Lincoln would have
never brought that here.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.461
I owe it my life.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.397
I can't
believe how many
people Alie has now.

08:41.606 --> 08:44.317
You see
this cluster?
It's a building.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.695
But all this,
these are minds.

08:47.904 --> 08:49.906
It's full of them.
Thousands.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.741
She's taken
Polis, too.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.409
Alie's army
is growing.

08:53.618 --> 08:54.410
The longer we
wait to go in,

08:54.619 --> 08:55.411
the stronger
she gets.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.246
Go in?
Raven, no.

08:57.455 --> 08:58.331
Our mission is--

08:58.539 --> 09:01.834
to wait for Clarke,
like always.

09:02.043 --> 09:04.212
But what if we can
do this ourselves?

09:04.420 --> 09:06.172
We have Becca's
back-door password.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.423
We have me.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.217
You said the moment
we use the password,

09:09.425 --> 09:10.468
Alie will know.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.470
She will.
I think.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.347
That means we have
one shot at this.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.890
Is there a kill code
in that book

09:16.098 --> 09:17.767
you didn't
tell me about?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.143
Then we stick
with the plan.

09:19.352 --> 09:21.103
Clarke gives the flame
to Luna.

09:21.312 --> 09:22.104
The AI
in the flame

09:22.313 --> 09:23.314
gives Luna
the kill code.

09:23.523 --> 09:25.399
We enter it here,
taking our one shot,

09:25.608 --> 09:26.859
and Bob's your Uncle.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.402
I hate that expression.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.574
Good.

09:33.783 --> 09:34.700
Let's keep mapping.

09:34.909 --> 09:36.536
What else
do you see?

09:36.744 --> 09:37.662
Perimeter's clear.

09:37.870 --> 09:38.913
Bryan and Miller
have watch.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.122
How's it going
in here?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.584
That good, huh?

09:46.587 --> 09:47.713
Take a break.

09:47.922 --> 09:48.714
I could use
some help

09:48.923 --> 09:51.050
securing the
South airlock.

09:51.259 --> 09:54.762
Go. Take the book
if you don't trust me.

09:54.971 --> 09:56.514
You memorized
Becca's password.

09:56.722 --> 09:57.932
Then I guess you'll
have to trust me.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.987
I'm worried
about her.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.363
She hasn't stopped
for two days.

10:12.572 --> 10:13.531
Neither have you.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.075
Yeah, but I'm just
trying to keep up.

10:16.284 --> 10:18.494
I'm serious.
I look at
Alie's code

10:18.703 --> 10:20.162
and I see physics
subroutines

10:20.371 --> 10:21.622
and collision
meshes.

10:21.831 --> 10:23.708
Raven sees
the city of light.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.918
It's not just
code to her.
It's real.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.716
Aren't we going
to the airlock?

10:31.924 --> 10:33.175
Already sealed.

10:36.262 --> 10:37.013
You OK?

10:37.221 --> 10:39.140
I'm fine. Yeah.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.393
I was just thinking.

10:43.728 --> 10:44.770
It's been two days

10:44.979 --> 10:46.397
with no one trying
to kill us.

10:46.606 --> 10:47.607
It won't last.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.401
I know.
But are we just

10:50.610 --> 10:52.320
supposed to spend
the time
between attacks

10:52.528 --> 10:53.446
dreading the next
one?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.031
Not like we have
much of a choice.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.076
Maybe we do.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.838
You're still you, right?

11:11.047 --> 11:13.924
Artificial intelligence
hasn't taken over
your brain?

11:14.133 --> 11:16.135
I'm still me.

11:16.344 --> 11:17.219
Awesome.

11:21.057 --> 11:22.933
Oh, my God. Oh.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.503
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.631
Um...That shark
story really
happen to you?

11:56.092 --> 11:57.385
Some of it.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.095
It gets better
every time I tell it.

12:02.223 --> 12:04.183
Are you really
from the sky?

12:04.392 --> 12:05.226
Yup.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.106
I've never even been
off this rig.

12:11.482 --> 12:13.901
Trust me, that's
a good thing. Heh.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.780
I'm Jasper.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.532
- Shay.
- Nice to meet you.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.123
Jasper's actually
smiling.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.214
Clarke.
Let it go.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.008
We can't just leave.

12:38.217 --> 12:39.719
It's not like we have
much of a choice.

12:41.429 --> 12:42.555
Maybe we do.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.683
What are you
talking about?

12:45.891 --> 12:48.144
I'm talking about
putting this
into her head

12:48.352 --> 12:50.104
without asking.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.689
No way, Clarke.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.065
This isn't like
Emerson.

12:53.274 --> 12:54.316
He was trying
to kill us.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.776
You think I don't
know that?

12:55.985 --> 12:58.571
Clarke,
we don't have
to do this.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.031
We can fight and go
back to Arkadia.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.075
- We arm up.
- Fight who?

13:03.284 --> 13:04.869
It's an army of
our own people.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.289
I don't like
this any more
than you do.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.749
But if
raven's right,

13:09.957 --> 13:11.959
and the code on
this thing can
stop Alie--

13:17.423 --> 13:18.591
Give me
a better idea.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.639
We'll stay here.
It's the only way

13:25.848 --> 13:27.057
they'll leave you
alone with her.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.563
Even Alie gives
people a choice.

13:32.772 --> 13:35.149
We gave
Luna a choice.

13:36.901 --> 13:37.943
She said no.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.626
I, um...
I should get back.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.588
No. No way.
Reality can wait.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.520
I haven't felt this
way in so long.

14:12.728 --> 14:13.729
happy?

14:14.897 --> 14:18.609
Yeah. And safe.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.113
Finally. Come on.
I found something.

14:27.201 --> 14:28.619
It's right here.

14:28.828 --> 14:30.621
- What is?
- Look at all these
layers of security.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.915
More than anything else
in the entire Alie code.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.667
- Firewall?
- More like a fortress.

14:34.875 --> 14:35.876
She calls it
the citadel.

14:36.085 --> 14:37.253
It overlooks
the entire city.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.255
It's separated by
water, like a moat,
so--

14:39.463 --> 14:40.714
slow down.
What are you saying?

14:40.923 --> 14:42.675
I'm saying she's
hiding something.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.427
- No.
- Monty.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.679
- No.
- With Becca's password,

14:46.887 --> 14:47.972
I can edit the code.
I'm sure of it.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.473
We've covered this.

14:49.682 --> 14:50.933
We map it
from the outside.
We don't go in.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.142
If we don't go in,
we won't know

14:52.351 --> 14:53.519
what she's
protecting there.

14:53.727 --> 14:54.937
We'll tell the others
when they come home.

14:55.145 --> 14:55.980
We decide together.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.022
What if they don't
come home?

14:57.231 --> 14:59.024
They're coming home.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.985
And they're bringing
back a supercomputer

15:01.193 --> 15:02.611
built for this.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.364
You may be freakishly
good, raven,

15:05.573 --> 15:06.907
but you're not an AI.

15:11.078 --> 15:11.996
I hate this.

15:13.289 --> 15:15.124
I know.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.458
Maybe some sleep
would help.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.628
I'm just gonna
keep mapping

15:19.837 --> 15:21.255
in case she has any
other vulnerabilities.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.343
Then we'll
do it together.

15:28.137 --> 15:30.055
I promise I won't
slow you down.

15:30.264 --> 15:31.599
I'll just
keep you company.

16:21.357 --> 16:22.733
Were they
born here?

16:22.942 --> 16:24.234
A few.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.903
Most were
orphaned by war.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.863
Or ran from one
they didn't
believe in.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.618
Like you
from the conclave.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.453
What did Titus
tell you about me?

16:36.956 --> 16:38.248
That you were
a coward.

16:39.416 --> 16:43.295
A traitor
to the blood.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.964
That sounds like Titus.

16:46.590 --> 16:49.510
Lexa's death must have
been hard for him.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.136
She was his favorite.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.266
You cared for her.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.770
Yes.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.272
Lexa was special.

17:04.149 --> 17:07.027
She was working
toward peace.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.654
Blood must not
have blood.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.784
You can finish
what she started.

17:13.993 --> 17:16.078
I have peace
right here.

17:16.286 --> 17:20.332
Luna...The flame
is your birthright.

17:20.541 --> 17:23.585
Take it. Please.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.754
You're the only one
who can save us.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.091
How many lives
would be lost

17:29.299 --> 17:30.759
to pay for those
I would save?

17:32.845 --> 17:35.389
Some causes are
worth killing for.

17:35.597 --> 17:36.765
Not to me.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.729
Ascende superius.

17:49.695 --> 17:50.529
Uhh!

17:50.738 --> 17:52.239
- Uhh.
- Uhh!

17:53.449 --> 17:54.992
I didn't flee
the conclave

17:55.200 --> 17:57.619
because I was afraid
I would lose.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.205
I fled because I knew
I would win.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.295
You should be
grateful, Clarke.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.422
After I was forced
to kill my own brother

18:08.630 --> 18:10.132
in the first round,

18:10.340 --> 18:13.427
I was matched against
Lexa in the second.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.304
Fate is funny that way,
don't you think?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.474
You'll get this back
when you leave.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.115
Remember,
don't shoot to kill.

18:35.324 --> 18:36.992
We need them.

18:37.201 --> 18:39.453
Why did your
creator leave you?

18:39.661 --> 18:43.373
I don't know.
But when I see her again,

18:43.582 --> 18:45.000
I will ask her.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.794
You really think
she's in the flame?

18:47.002 --> 18:49.755
Yes. And if
I'm right,

18:49.963 --> 18:52.007
it contains the minds
of all of those

18:52.216 --> 18:54.718
to whom it was
connected,

18:54.927 --> 18:56.678
beginning with
my creator.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.807
No, no, no,
not her, not her.

19:01.558 --> 19:05.020
They know we're here.
Bar the door.

19:05.229 --> 19:06.188
I'll get
their guns.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.314
We're gonna
need them.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.030
He's powering
the pod.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.495
What about
the secret passage?

19:23.038 --> 19:26.083
She'll know about that now.
I'll lock it up.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.209
No, don't.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.463
She didn't see us
come in.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.466
Besides, we'll need that
later to escape.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.387
Thank you, Titus.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.270
John.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.355
That's a nuclear
fuel cell, John.

19:50.816 --> 19:53.360
You'll irradiate
the entire city.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.240
So, how do
we destroy it?

20:03.370 --> 20:04.246
Carefully.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.837
Where's Jasper?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.046
Saying good-bye
to his new friend.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.060
Sorry, cap.
You gotta take them back.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.854
Your gear.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.981
You get your weapons
once you land.

20:31.190 --> 20:32.065
Inside.

20:35.027 --> 20:35.903
The flame?

20:37.196 --> 20:39.406
Remember, Clarke.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.074
The path of violence
is a choice.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.159
There it is.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.620
When the choice
is fight or die,

20:44.828 --> 20:46.163
there is no choice.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.420
They took the flame.

20:53.629 --> 20:54.713
They're locking us in.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.925
Hey!
What is this?

20:59.176 --> 21:00.802
Luna's people
are attacking her.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.388
Alie's here.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.352
You could come back,
you know.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.812
Something tells me
it's not that simple.

21:11.021 --> 21:13.857
Besides, it's nice here.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.568
Trust me,
I'd just mess it up.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.367
Shay, run before--uhh.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.453
She's here.

21:26.662 --> 21:27.913
He knows.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.373
Go.
Tell your people

21:29.581 --> 21:30.499
not to take
the chip!

21:30.707 --> 21:31.959
We can't let her
warn the others.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.085
Run, now! Go!

21:34.795 --> 21:35.837
Aah!

21:36.046 --> 21:36.922
No.

21:37.130 --> 21:37.965
Uhh!

22:11.331 --> 22:12.541
Leave her alone!

22:12.749 --> 22:16.253
What are you doing?

22:16.461 --> 22:17.296
Derrick.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.839
Aah!

22:19.047 --> 22:20.757
Why are you doing this?

22:20.966 --> 22:22.384
...Kill you! No!

22:23.593 --> 22:25.929
Aah! No!

22:35.897 --> 22:37.691
How did Alie
even find this place?

22:41.945 --> 22:43.822
There was a drone
at Niylah's.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.824
She must've
followed us looking
for the flame

22:46.033 --> 22:46.950
and now she has it.

22:49.036 --> 22:51.079
No! Stop!

22:57.252 --> 22:59.421
Take the key
and this will end.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.381
What's happened to you?

23:01.590 --> 23:03.008
He's not himself.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.885
It's the chip in his hand.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.598
Jasper is decreasing
the efficiency of the process.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.516
He needs to take
the key.

23:11.725 --> 23:12.684
Uhh!

23:17.773 --> 23:19.524
Oh!

23:19.733 --> 23:20.525
Again.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.113
Aah!

23:25.322 --> 23:26.907
She's gonna put
the AI in Luna.

23:28.617 --> 23:30.202
She'd have to
chip her first.

23:32.788 --> 23:35.665
If Luna’s chipped
before she gets the AI,

23:35.874 --> 23:38.377
Alie's gonna know
everything.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.128
We'll never be
able to stop her.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.130
We can't let
that happen.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.216
Hey!

23:44.424 --> 23:46.385
Aah!

23:50.847 --> 23:51.765
Uhh.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.104
I'm sorry, Luna.

23:59.981 --> 24:00.899
I cannot
take it.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.693
If you stop,
I'll do it.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.530
I'll do it.

24:07.823 --> 24:08.990
It's OK.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.510
Derrick.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.317
You just need
to take the key.

25:00.459 --> 25:03.044
Hurry. This door won't
last much longer.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.963
Then you're gonna have
to pick up a gun then.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.758
You're all going to
die here, John.

25:11.428 --> 25:12.596
Hurry, Thelonious.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.681
The migration is
not yet complete.

25:14.890 --> 25:17.142
We're still
searching for the
tunnel entrance.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.562
When the guards
break down the door,
I'll be there.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.898
Good.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.649
John Murphy was
with Clarke Griffin

25:24.858 --> 25:26.276
when they removed
the second AI

25:26.485 --> 25:27.652
from the last commander.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.071
If she won't help us
insert it into Luna,

25:30.280 --> 25:31.656
then we'll need him alive.

25:50.634 --> 25:51.927
I'm coming for you.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.225
What will you
do with Clarke?

25:58.433 --> 26:01.269
I will give her
the same choice
as the rest.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.604
Join us or--

26:05.148 --> 26:06.650
- what is it?
- Someone is accessing

26:06.858 --> 26:08.818
my code with an
administrative login.

26:09.945 --> 26:11.863
Accessing it?
From where?

26:12.072 --> 26:14.658
The intrusion is
coming from Arkadia.

26:14.866 --> 26:15.825
Arkadia?

26:17.077 --> 26:19.204
It could be
Jacapo Sinclair

26:19.412 --> 26:20.747
or Monty green.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.415
Jacapo Sinclair
is dead.

26:22.624 --> 26:23.667
How do you know that?

26:23.875 --> 26:25.126
Unimportant.

26:25.335 --> 26:27.504
The login was coded
by my creator.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.425
I can't
log them out.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.802
Disconnect from Arkadia.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.470
That would
be unwise.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.847
The migration is
still incomplete

26:38.056 --> 26:39.975
and the backpack is
now compromised.

26:41.184 --> 26:43.728
Without Arkadia's
mainframe,

26:43.937 --> 26:45.939
the mobile unit would be
my sole power source.

26:50.277 --> 26:54.531
If they destroy it...
I will be terminated.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.331
They're inside
the citadel.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.463
If it's Monty,
I can stop him.

27:11.631 --> 27:12.549
How?

27:20.974 --> 27:21.766
Raven, are you crazy?

27:21.975 --> 27:24.060
Don't! Don't.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.896
I'm in her citadel.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.816
So many doors.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.568
They're locked.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.111
But I can
delete locks.

27:35.488 --> 27:38.241
I was right.
She's hiding
something here.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.534
I just have
to get past...

27:43.663 --> 27:44.956
Someone's
in the way.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.374
Someone?

27:46.583 --> 27:48.043
Yeah, a person.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.919
I can't get
around them.

27:50.128 --> 27:51.921
Why not?
Who is it?

27:54.758 --> 27:55.634
Monty?

27:58.178 --> 27:59.471
Monty, can you hear me?

28:05.769 --> 28:06.811
Mom?

28:12.108 --> 28:13.026
Monty.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.320
I wish I could see you.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.447
Maybe I will someday.

28:19.366 --> 28:21.076
She sounds so real.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.494
Alie processed it.

28:23.787 --> 28:27.415
But it's her mind.
It's her.

28:30.043 --> 28:31.961
Can she hear me?

28:32.170 --> 28:33.046
You have to type.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.886
We need more time.
Hannah, keep him talking.

28:40.095 --> 28:40.929
Monty?

28:42.389 --> 28:44.474
Monty, are you
still there?

28:44.683 --> 28:46.101
Alie
wants us to stop.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.811
That's why
she sent her.

28:48.019 --> 28:50.689
She doesn't want us
to see what's on
the other side.

28:50.897 --> 28:53.775
What you
did to me, I know it hurts.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.363
I'm sorry.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.115
I know.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.409
I want to take that pain away.

29:02.617 --> 29:05.036
That's all any of us want.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.499
We're
almost there, Hannah.
Keep going.

29:09.708 --> 29:13.712
We can be
together again.
Don't you want that?

29:15.088 --> 29:17.757
What happens if we
delete her code?

29:20.260 --> 29:22.178
- Monty--
- what happens?

29:24.013 --> 29:26.307
She'll be gone.
Forever.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.894
I love you, son.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.526
How do I do it?

29:36.735 --> 29:37.819
How do I do it?

29:45.660 --> 29:46.828
You hit enter.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.126
Monty?

29:56.963 --> 29:58.006
I love you, too.

30:07.307 --> 30:08.308
Get out
of there, Alie.

30:08.516 --> 30:09.976
Leave Arkadia.
Do it. Now.

30:10.185 --> 30:10.977
I told you.
If I

30:11.186 --> 30:12.520
remove myself
from Arkadia,

30:12.729 --> 30:15.440
the mobile unit
will be my sole
power source.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.652
Do it.
Shut her down.

30:30.663 --> 30:31.956
I'm through
the last door.

30:35.794 --> 30:36.669
I see it.

30:39.506 --> 30:42.550
It's a kill switch.
All I have to do is--

30:42.759 --> 30:45.845
no. No.
No, no, no!

30:46.054 --> 30:46.971
What happened?

30:48.097 --> 30:49.098
What happened?!

30:52.352 --> 30:54.229
She must've pulled
herself from the mainframe

30:54.437 --> 30:56.022
before I had time
to hit the kill switch.

30:58.149 --> 31:00.652
This was all
for nothing?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.111
No, Monty, no.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.780
Now we know there's
a kill switch.

31:03.988 --> 31:06.366
A kill switch
we can't use

31:06.574 --> 31:07.992
because the code
is gone!

31:10.245 --> 31:11.371
This is your fault.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.289
We were supposed to
wait for the others.

31:14.499 --> 31:15.834
You want to take
the chip again?

31:16.042 --> 31:17.335
Is that it?
You want to go
back in there?

31:19.671 --> 31:22.715
Here. Take it.

31:22.924 --> 31:26.010
I'm sorry.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.513
I'm sorry.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.187
Crap.

31:36.396 --> 31:39.274
It's about to go.
Just tell me where
to hit this thing.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.150
Indra,
the gun, please.

31:41.359 --> 31:42.902
I require
60 seconds

31:43.111 --> 31:44.112
to complete
the migration.

31:50.994 --> 31:53.746
Either we do this now
or we run.

31:54.873 --> 31:55.874
OK, do it.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.459
Just don't hit
the fuel cell.

31:58.668 --> 31:59.878
Here.

32:00.086 --> 32:00.837
Talk to him, Emori.

32:01.045 --> 32:03.131
You can't let him do this.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.258
John, please, John,
listen to me.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.219
It's not just Alie
in there, John.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.096
It's all of us.

32:10.305 --> 32:11.431
Forget about the nuke.

32:11.639 --> 32:15.018
I'm telling you.
Me. Emori.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.521
You are
making a mistake.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.440
The minds of everyone
who has entered

32:20.648 --> 32:23.359
the city of light
are on that server.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.071
30 seconds.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.115
If you destroy it,

32:29.324 --> 32:31.284
our minds will be
gone forever.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.246
I'll be gone

32:35.455 --> 32:36.748
forever, John.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.296
10 seconds.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.094
I can't

33:00.396 --> 33:01.272
did it work?

33:02.398 --> 33:03.566
Are you OK?

33:10.198 --> 33:11.658
You were too late.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.411
Let's go.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.375
Can't let her
see the door.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.765
They used a tunnel.

33:38.101 --> 33:39.060
Find it.

33:51.906 --> 33:53.741
They could've destroyed
everything today.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.120
And they will try again.

33:57.328 --> 34:00.123
It's all right,
Thelonious.

34:00.331 --> 34:02.667
The migration
was a success.

34:02.875 --> 34:06.004
The transmission from
the escape pod is complete.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.839
They can't get to us here.

34:39.037 --> 34:41.039
This place was safe
until we got here.

34:57.930 --> 34:58.765
Oh, my God.

35:06.731 --> 35:08.066
Machine room.

35:11.319 --> 35:12.528
B-level.

35:23.706 --> 35:24.707
Let's go.

35:43.684 --> 35:46.521
No. No.

35:46.729 --> 35:49.273
Take it and the child
will be fine.

35:49.482 --> 35:50.399
No.

35:54.904 --> 35:57.365
Cut the child
and she'll submit.

35:57.573 --> 35:58.741
- Luna?
- No.

36:05.498 --> 36:06.374
Aah!

36:19.679 --> 36:22.014
We can't let Clarke
have the nightblood.

36:23.432 --> 36:24.308
Kill her.

36:26.769 --> 36:27.979
Derrick, this isn't you.

36:29.814 --> 36:31.023
Please, Derrick, don't.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.207
Oh, be careful.

36:51.169 --> 36:53.171
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.298
You OK?
I got you.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.853
I'm fine.
They couldn't break me.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.065
Where's shay?

37:16.444 --> 37:17.528
I'm sorry.

37:19.739 --> 37:20.698
It's what we do.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.579
I'm so sorry.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.716
I'm so sorry.

38:07.245 --> 38:09.455
Any one of them could
be chipped and we'd never know.

38:09.664 --> 38:11.082
If they are, they'll
make their move

38:11.290 --> 38:12.750
before we put
the flame in Luna.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.210
Stay sharp.

38:14.418 --> 38:15.419
Changed her mind?

38:15.628 --> 38:16.462
Quiet.

38:20.258 --> 38:21.842
The ceremony
is about to begin.

38:24.387 --> 38:25.554
Luna, wait.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.391
I'm so sorry.

38:28.599 --> 38:30.935
But now you see
what we're facing.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.813
An enemy that will
do anything to win.

38:34.021 --> 38:36.107
She won't stop until
she has everyone.

38:41.070 --> 38:43.698
People I love
died today.

38:43.906 --> 38:46.742
Needlessly.
At my hand.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.121
I can't let that
happen again.

38:59.463 --> 39:04.885
As we prepare to give our
brothers and sister to the sea,

39:05.094 --> 39:06.387
we honor their lives.

39:13.185 --> 39:17.481
Kom woda 'so gyon op,
gon woda 'so kom daun.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.032
If we're gonna do this,
we have to hurry.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.451
Alie will send
reinforcements.

39:28.659 --> 39:29.952
And we have to find
someplace private

39:30.161 --> 39:31.704
to perform
the ascension.

39:31.912 --> 39:33.998
You believe that
to defeat an enemy

39:34.206 --> 39:36.208
who will stop
at nothing,

39:36.417 --> 39:38.502
you must
stop at nothing.

39:40.963 --> 39:43.716
How is that
different than blood
must have blood?

39:44.925 --> 39:46.844
Wait a second.
Luna.

39:47.053 --> 39:49.180
You can't just--

40:02.360 --> 40:03.444
No.

40:55.121 --> 40:56.122
Now what?
