WEBVTT

00:03.940 --> 00:06.000
(LADY) I-I really can't stay very long.

00:06.086 --> 00:07.206
I have to be up in early hour.

00:07.817 --> 00:09.767
Did I say something at dinner
that i should know about?

00:09.813 --> 00:11.414
No, I'm just exhausted. Its all.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.901
Look, you can..uh..

00:14.197 --> 00:15.993
You can spend the night, you can crash here.

00:16.041 --> 00:17.650
I..uh..i can get you to work in the morning.

00:17.712 --> 00:19.193
I'll sleep on the couch.

00:19.255 --> 00:20.710
No funny business, I promise.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.597
Of course if you started any funny business..

00:21.737 --> 00:23.675
Look, I have...

00:24.495 --> 00:25.428
this rule...

00:25.491 --> 00:26.131
Yeah

00:27.515 --> 00:28.915
No sleepovers on a first date.

00:29.189 --> 00:29.861
Right.

00:30.394 --> 00:31.947
unless involves fitsy pyjamas.

00:31.995 --> 00:32.799
Perfect.

00:33.064 --> 00:34.884
Do you like cowboys or dinosaurs..

00:35.379 --> 00:36.531
Cause I've got both.

00:37.532 --> 00:39.026
Well then,maybe I should have some coffee?

00:39.289 --> 00:41.342
All right I've got a French Press.

00:42.277 --> 00:42.816
   Oh God.

00:43.967 --> 00:44.628
What's going on?

00:45.050 --> 00:45.987
(SNEEZES)

00:47.276 --> 00:48.493
 I can't stay.

00:48.588 --> 00:50.055
Yes you can.
  (SNEEZES)

00:50.095 --> 00:51.726
Billie, sure you can.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.616
You have cats?

00:52.624 --> 00:53.733
No I dont. I hate cats.

00:53.773 --> 00:54.608
Why would I have a cat?

00:54.695 --> 00:55.815
I have to get out of here...

00:55.817 --> 00:58.307
before my face swells up
and my lungs collapse.

00:58.376 --> 00:59.391
Let's talk about this.

00:59.604 --> 01:00.432
Wait a minute..what..

01:00.662 --> 01:01.412
Woah,what the hell.

01:01.427 --> 01:03.028
You told me you had no pets.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.879
That is not mine. That..

01:04.902 --> 01:06.722
I will not be lied to.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.010
Billie.

01:14.684 --> 01:16.471
I do not know how it got out of his cage.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.245
You brought a ferret into my house.

01:18.265 --> 01:19.838
Look I was just trying to do Sandy a favor,okay.

01:19.852 --> 01:21.446
My place does have a strict no pets clause.

01:21.471 --> 01:22.636
Woah, this is Sandy's ferret?

01:22.653 --> 01:23.850
Sandy's niece.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.530
Went to asia for six months.

01:25.655 --> 01:27.893
and then, Sandy was gonna watch it
but her landlady's like

01:28.100 --> 01:31.060
The ferrets are disease carriers. Which
a total fallacy by the way.

01:31.060 --> 01:33.000
All right,look,okay.
The ferret is out.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.950
I want my keys back and you no
longer have privileges at my place.

01:36.043 --> 01:37.424
   All right, that's fair.

01:38.050 --> 01:40.152
Hey, what's going with the your new
assignment you told me about the chef.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.430
Yeah, Dylan Morris, he's..uh..this guy
is testifying against a mob boss.

01:43.454 --> 01:45.279
Are you serious?
The witness protection guy?

01:45.284 --> 01:45.877
Uh..uh..

01:45.901 --> 01:47.247
   That's huge news, it's everywhere.
Yeah.

01:47.287 --> 01:49.438
It's like good fellas meets admiral.

01:49.470 --> 01:50.204
Sure.

01:50.726 --> 01:51.375
Wow.

01:51.614 --> 01:53.425
So what you gonna do for him, i mean..

01:53.629 --> 01:54.749
read him his last rights?

01:55.030 --> 01:56.678
I don't know, I don't know,
if I knew I..

01:56.796 --> 01:58.436
Yeah, you wouldn't tell me.
Right.

01:58.490 --> 01:59.420
That's fine,it doesn't bother me.

01:59.450 --> 02:00.987
You're okay with it?
yeah?

02:01.066 --> 02:02.146
I'd lied about it.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.000 --> 02:13.130
I...

02:20.442 --> 02:22.828
   I'm thinking about...

02:25.593 --> 02:27.413
a barn.

02:27.499 --> 02:28.619
A barn?

02:28.638 --> 02:32.191
One those old not quite falling down
places that you see out in the country

02:32.480 --> 02:35.043
Yeah,there's one in Prince Edward County
I've had my eye on.

02:36.393 --> 02:37.252
Unfortunately Dylan,

02:37.276 --> 02:41.020
I don't think that you're gonna be opening up
any restaurants in witness protection,but..

02:41.327 --> 02:42.683
Hey, sorry I'm late.

02:42.699 --> 02:44.589
it makes you feel better to fantasize

02:44.930 --> 02:46.980
   Well it's certainly better...

02:46.980 --> 02:48.625
So what's going on?

02:48.765 --> 02:50.492
 a bullet in my head at any moment.

02:50.534 --> 02:53.547
(DEV) Uh..that's Dylan Morris our star witness.
Right.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.758
In the next two weeks until trial,

02:55.827 --> 02:58.889
we will have people on all of our witnesses
twenty four-seven.

02:59.658 --> 03:00.911
We've got you covered.

03:02.060 --> 03:04.990
   (DYLAN) Says the spider to the fly.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.074
And who's this?

03:07.121 --> 03:09.699
That's the Crown Counsel Isabelle Desante.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.659
I want to take you back
to the night of the shooting.

03:12.855 --> 03:14.197
Well,you don't bore easily.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.832
The jury hasn't heard it.

03:16.458 --> 03:19.775
The Crown Counsel is worried that
Dylan's testimony won't be enough.

03:20.002 --> 03:21.972
 Klein wants us to dig up whatever we can.

03:22.064 --> 03:23.184
Which is why you're here.

03:23.887 --> 03:26.320
We're hoping there is something
he might have overlooked.

03:26.571 --> 03:29.364
Something he might be seeing.
(DEV) But not saying.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.364
Sigh, so the last customer had gun..

03:35.309 --> 03:36.740
My cousin Jack,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.522
he manages the restaurant for me.

03:39.241 --> 03:42.652
He and I are going over the index totals
and we hear an argument.

03:43.699 --> 03:45.566
   So I go into the wine bar.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.030
   I see Will my business partner

03:49.668 --> 03:51.980
   is having it out with Zapata.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.840
   Your other business partner.

03:54.395 --> 03:59.225
Can you tell the court how you first
came to meet Nick Zapata.

04:00.378 --> 04:02.230
(KLEIN) This is for all the marbles, Dylan.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.799
You screw up in the stand,
the whole case goes belly up.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.414
and so do I?

04:07.974 --> 04:09.262
That what you were going to say?

04:09.349 --> 04:11.067
So, I repeat the question?

04:13.395 --> 04:15.668
   Before Sterling got involved...

04:15.787 --> 04:17.726
   I went to Zapata for some start of cash.

04:18.997 --> 04:22.412
Huh,the two of them never
got along from the beginning.

04:22.539 --> 04:25.650
And I did everything in my power
to keep them apart.

04:25.721 --> 04:29.868
Clearly,they make an arrangement to meet
at the restaurant after it closed.

04:37.199 --> 04:38.160
(GUNSHOT)

04:38.203 --> 04:39.682
The second shot...

04:42.038 --> 04:43.977
   Stirling stopped moving.

04:44.090 --> 04:47.360
And I was afraid that
Zapata was going to do me too.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.212
He just dropped the gun..

04:52.574 --> 04:53.882
told me to clean up

04:54.120 --> 04:56.090
   and then he left.

05:01.508 --> 05:02.504
Well?

05:02.983 --> 05:05.459
I saw what he described exactly how he said it.

05:05.483 --> 05:06.299
No question?

05:06.330 --> 05:07.450
No, no.

05:07.870 --> 05:09.318
But he seem a bit nervous..

05:09.465 --> 05:13.006
Yeah, well the man is about to put away a mob boss,
I think you'd be nervous too.

05:26.653 --> 05:30.017
Okay, so Dylan hears an argument
in the wine bar...

05:30.033 --> 05:34.262
and he finds his business partner,Will Sterling
yelling at big time crime boss Nick Zapata..

05:34.281 --> 05:36.359
about how he wants his investment back.

05:36.389 --> 05:39.139
And then in front of Dylan, Zapata kills Sterling.

05:39.175 --> 05:40.849
Let's hope it's enough for the jury.

05:41.605 --> 05:44.474
So, in the beginning,
Dylan covered up the murder, right?

05:44.490 --> 05:45.925
Yeah,that was our bargaining chip.

05:45.944 --> 05:48.632
We don't prosecute in exchange for Zapata's testimony.

05:48.653 --> 05:50.589
Well, then he points the finger at Zapata,

05:50.715 --> 05:52.650
I mean, doesn't that feel a little self serving?

05:52.652 --> 05:55.144
That's the downside of flipping
a co-conspirator.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.457
Hopefully, the jury sees Zapata is the greater evil.

05:57.473 --> 05:58.183
Right.

05:58.246 --> 05:59.930
(KNOCKING)

06:01.526 --> 06:04.214
Dylan's cousin Jack is on his way up
if you wanna observe..

06:04.215 --> 06:06.929
and one of my people is on
the sous chef Magda Desmond

06:06.944 --> 06:08.699
So that should do us for the witnesses.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.855
Isabelle, I'd like you to meet Toby Logan.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.246
Toby, this is the Crown Counsel, Isabelle Desante.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.457
Pleasure, Mr. Logan.

06:14.473 --> 06:15.368
Desante.

06:15.559 --> 06:18.612
Mr. Logan is our resitting consultant
on facial expressions.

06:18.713 --> 06:19.899
Stuff like that.

06:19.914 --> 06:20.945
Uhmm..

06:21.007 --> 06:23.403
So tell me, how do you know
if a witness is lying?

06:23.418 --> 06:24.472
Their lips are moving.

06:24.536 --> 06:26.110
(CHUCKLES)

06:26.110 --> 06:29.040
Remind me to get you to
screen my next jury pool.

06:29.057 --> 06:29.838
Thank you.

06:34.897 --> 06:36.182
   Hey Jack.

06:39.070 --> 06:39.841
 How you doing?

06:39.852 --> 06:41.192
Oh, hanging in there, you know.

06:41.988 --> 06:42.774
You?

06:42.791 --> 06:43.575
Good.

06:43.692 --> 06:45.877
I'm getting kind of tired
coming to this place though.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.936
   Right this way Mr Nassiter.

06:50.090 --> 06:52.186
   It'll all be over soon, all right.

06:52.273 --> 06:53.421
All right.

06:57.487 --> 07:00.273
(JACK) It should have been me
who walked into that wine bar instead of Dylan.

07:00.572 --> 07:02.867
The guy who's done time for aggravated assault

07:02.888 --> 07:04.838
would have been a better peacemaker,
is that it?

07:05.107 --> 07:07.589
Like I said, I'm not proud of my past.

07:07.738 --> 07:09.165
I did some things..

07:09.282 --> 07:11.140
   things that I paid a price for.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.624
   But Dylan, he helped me get around that

07:15.851 --> 07:18.876
And in gratitude you hooked him up with Zapata?

07:20.001 --> 07:21.817
My cousin came to me for help..

07:21.881 --> 07:23.466
his restaurant was going under.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.507
What's so difficult for you to get about that?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.841
Oh, we get he was in trouble, but
not everybody goes to the mob for a loan.

07:28.873 --> 07:30.792
Well not everybody's tapped out of the banks.

07:30.901 --> 07:31.893
Know what I mean?

07:32.124 --> 07:35.054
I'm supposed to sit there and watch
my cousin's dream go up in smoke?

07:35.110 --> 07:37.080
when I had a direct line to some easy money?

07:37.426 --> 07:39.933
Two weeks from now,
you're talking to the jury.

07:45.139 --> 07:48.066
We're sitting there,
we hear this yelling and..

07:48.091 --> 07:50.520
it's obvious is coming from the wine bar..

07:50.566 --> 07:52.418
so I get up to go and have a look

07:52.434 --> 07:54.350
but Dylan's like..
(DYLAN) No,no,no,no.

07:55.355 --> 07:57.092
   I'll go see.

08:01.593 --> 08:03.000
(GUNSHOT)

08:03.225 --> 08:04.210
(GUNSHOT)

08:04.217 --> 08:05.811
I hear two shots.

08:06.910 --> 08:09.841
I go for the wine bar,
I see Zapata running out..

08:09.881 --> 08:12.051
I go in..find Sterling, dead.

08:12.433 --> 08:16.680
So you know Zapata says it was you
who had a bad blood with Stirling.

08:17.147 --> 08:21.327
That if anyone had motive,
it was you.

08:22.839 --> 08:24.276
He says a lot of things.

08:24.292 --> 08:26.494
But you don't deny wanting Sterling out.

08:26.932 --> 08:30.026
I knew bringing him aboard would be a bad news.

08:30.089 --> 08:31.489
but Dylan, he had big plans.

08:32.539 --> 08:33.984
want to expand and what not..

08:35.059 --> 08:37.990
   But then...
bang, bang.

08:38.847 --> 08:40.331
   Dream's over.

08:41.957 --> 08:43.138
Anything?

08:43.193 --> 08:44.313
Well..

08:44.356 --> 08:46.879
the only difference between
his memory and Dylan's memory..

08:46.893 --> 08:49.315
is that Jack off to go check the argument.

08:50.109 --> 08:52.385
Other than that, pretty much the same.

08:52.838 --> 08:54.166
Sorry, uh..

08:54.168 --> 08:55.768
Amy Sterling the victim's wife..

08:55.775 --> 08:56.969
She's downstairs.

08:57.141 --> 08:58.624
Okay,have her come up.

08:58.648 --> 09:00.956
   She was hoping she doesn't have to.

09:09.070 --> 09:12.000
I wish I had more confidence
that monster will be convicted.

09:12.059 --> 09:15.205
Well, the Crown Counsel believe
she can make her case.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.265
I can barely get that woman to return my calls.

09:18.482 --> 09:21.457
She's doing everything she possibly can,
I promise you.

09:22.506 --> 09:26.481
People say, Zapata is too powerful
to be touched.

09:26.810 --> 09:27.934
Not this time.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.054
When Will found out who
his partners really were..

09:33.116 --> 09:35.023
he felt like he'd been kicked in the gut.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.175
We were blind sided.

09:37.348 --> 09:40.550
And now he's dead and the whole world
thinks that Will was a crooked businessman.

09:41.094 --> 09:44.639
I can't even begin to imagine how
difficult this is all been for you.

09:45.020 --> 09:48.940
They killed my husband, then they
destroyed his reputation.

09:49.728 --> 09:51.228
I can't bring him back.

09:51.439 --> 09:52.970
I just wanna save his good name.

09:54.117 --> 09:54.954
   We will.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.950
(OZ MAKES A KISSEY SOUND)
Don't irritate it.

09:59.950 --> 10:02.000
It can't get out right...
I mean everything is...

10:02.000 --> 10:04.880
No,no,no. How's it going to get out
It doesn't have opposable thumbs.

10:05.089 --> 10:06.145
All right.

10:06.216 --> 10:10.348
Well I guess look, if it's for Sandy I guess
you can keep it in the locker room.

10:10.450 --> 10:11.607
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

10:11.623 --> 10:13.138
Smells bad enough in there as it is.

10:13.162 --> 10:13.911
Right.

10:14.845 --> 10:17.218
So, uh how long you figure it's gonna..

10:17.499 --> 10:19.714
all right, he or she or whatever
is gonna be here?

10:19.731 --> 10:20.608
Oh, it's just a couple of days.

10:20.630 --> 10:22.746
My parents is gonna take it but
they live above the restaurant.

10:22.749 --> 10:24.004
So, they can't..uh..

10:24.255 --> 10:25.032
Hey, wait a second..

10:25.587 --> 10:26.110
You wouldn't consider..

10:26.140 --> 10:27.110
Consider what?

10:27.469 --> 10:28.290
Taking the thing.

10:28.329 --> 10:29.977
I mean you got kids.
I know you love your kids.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.020
I mean this thing is hours of fun.
Look at the way it's playing with those...

10:32.020 --> 10:33.372
   Forget it, Mr Bey.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.960
It's just I couldn't think of a nicer family
and a better home really.

10:36.985 --> 10:38.221
   I said NO!

10:43.406 --> 10:45.114
   (MICHELLE) You want to drop the case?

10:45.153 --> 10:46.308
Not at all.

10:46.488 --> 10:48.197
In fact, I want to raise the (inaudible)

10:48.235 --> 10:51.429
I'm sorry, are you trying Zapata
on murder charges or not?

10:51.493 --> 10:52.961
What Isabelle is getting at..

10:53.024 --> 10:53.980
Thank you Alvin,

10:54.003 --> 10:55.990
but I think I can get at what
I'm getting at.

10:56.457 --> 11:00.171
You traded your little fish chef for
a bigger fish, Zapata.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.981
Now I want to use Zapata to trade up to a really big fish.

11:03.013 --> 11:04.362
Well, now I know I'm missing something.

11:04.393 --> 11:07.214
We had an unexpected breakthrough
late last night from Interpol.

11:07.253 --> 11:09.940
We think we can tie Zapata to an
international money laundering..

11:09.940 --> 11:12.210
scheme involving hundreds
of millions of dollars.

11:12.217 --> 11:14.981
Great, so we can get him for murder and money laundering.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.641
Why throw up the baby with the bathwater?

11:16.672 --> 11:18.734
It's not about throwing anything up.
Michelle, it's about...

11:18.791 --> 11:21.182
It's about using it, leverage.

11:21.190 --> 11:24.727
We plea bargain our way into a case
against the International Syndicate.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.834
And you think he's gonna give up his
crime pals to beat a murder wrap.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.776
If he thinks the murder wrap is going
to stick, then yeah, you bet.

11:30.784 --> 11:32.183
 You support this?

11:32.498 --> 11:34.662
Uh..I like to accuse myself if possible.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.080
I've been working this case since
we took over from Metro.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.695
Getting Dylan to turn wasn't a matter
of saying please and thank you.

11:39.719 --> 11:41.809
And now you want me to
tell him to just forget it?

11:41.807 --> 11:42.698
She's got a point.

11:42.730 --> 11:43.940
What happens if your star witness

11:43.940 --> 11:45.837
gets cold feet on the day of trial..

11:45.852 --> 11:48.044
   what then, you lose Zapata on murder..

11:48.076 --> 11:50.561
and any chance of landing
the whales that he was swimming with.

11:50.576 --> 11:51.878
She's also got a point.

11:51.973 --> 11:55.867
Well, I just told Will Sterling's widow that
the man who killed her husband would pay.

11:55.867 --> 11:58.267
   Well that's a limb you went out on
Sergeant Mcclusky.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.369
Not me.

12:03.574 --> 12:07.111
I don't know what you hoped to get
from dragging me down here, again.

12:07.133 --> 12:11.019
Well it's not the murder I'm so
interested in per se Mr. Zapata,

12:11.037 --> 12:14.459
it's a trip that you took to Europe last fall.

12:15.022 --> 12:16.142
October 2nd,

12:16.531 --> 12:19.612
this is you emerging from a bay in (inaudible).

12:19.739 --> 12:23.090
Now those two gentlemen that you with
there, they since been brought up

12:23.090 --> 12:25.564
on money laundering
and racketeering charges.

12:25.588 --> 12:27.763
Some people just take the wrong path in life.

12:27.802 --> 12:31.134
Well, you're not aware that new
international banking regulations

12:31.150 --> 12:34.100
require reporting of suspicious transactions.

12:34.141 --> 12:35.426
That's good to know.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.536
Arthur, take a note of that.

12:37.566 --> 12:41.847
Now we know that you opened a common
account with both of those gentlemen.

12:41.879 --> 12:43.907
and that withdrawals and deposits

12:43.924 --> 12:48.129
from said account are in excess of
ten million dollars a month.

12:48.151 --> 12:51.475
What do you got against a businessman
trying to make a legitimate living?

12:53.389 --> 12:56.061
You go to trial in two weeks for
the murder of Will Sterling.

12:56.077 --> 12:57.820
A murder I did not commit.

12:57.836 --> 13:00.018
Well I have an eye witness
that says different.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.883
And quite frankly Mr Zapata
with your background,

13:02.904 --> 13:05.430
I don't see a jury being
disabused of that notion.

13:05.515 --> 13:08.930
Arthur, she's now accusing me
of abusing the jury.

13:08.971 --> 13:10.930
No, Mr. Zapata, what I'm saying..

13:10.992 --> 13:12.719
What the Crown Counsel wants is for

13:12.742 --> 13:14.726
you to give evidence against these men

13:14.741 --> 13:16.866
and others in exchange
for the murder charges

13:16.883 --> 13:18.077
   being dropped.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.582
Well that is very interesting.

13:31.768 --> 13:33.246
Isn't that interesting Arthur?

13:34.488 --> 13:35.965
You gals just blew it.

13:36.043 --> 13:36.774
I'm sorry?

13:36.787 --> 13:38.662
You told us you have nothing.

13:38.679 --> 13:39.639
I said no such thing.

13:39.670 --> 13:41.802
Your murder case just flamed out.

13:41.839 --> 13:43.583
We know you were at the
restaurant that night.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.790
I never said I wasn't.

13:44.821 --> 13:47.507
You got into a heated
exchange with Mr Sterling.

13:47.539 --> 13:49.096
Because he was scum.

13:49.682 --> 13:52.515
I told you he wanted
to pull his money out.

13:54.087 --> 13:56.963
Jack was furious, he had more
of a beef than I did.

13:57.830 --> 14:00.291
When I left there were still going at it.

14:00.346 --> 14:03.672
Like I told you ten times,
Jack should be on trial here..

14:03.673 --> 14:04.656
not me.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.900
And as far of the plea bargain,
you can shove it lady..

14:07.923 --> 14:11.611
cause the only deal that I'm interested in
from you is for you to drop all the charges..

14:11.654 --> 14:13.849
and make a public apology.

14:22.544 --> 14:24.536
Sad to say that-that didn't go well.

14:24.545 --> 14:26.912
Well, it might have gone better
if you let me do the talking.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.300
But i guess you got what you wanted.

14:28.343 --> 14:30.748
No, offering to negotiate the murder
charges showed weakness.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.792
Michelle, this is not the slamdunk cases
that you seem to think that it is.

14:33.820 --> 14:35.910
Dylan Morris could be playing us for fools

14:35.942 --> 14:39.101
hoping that we put away a very
powerful man who wants him dead.

14:39.234 --> 14:41.702
If we don't get him on money laundering,
you better hope to hell

14:41.702 --> 14:45.973
that the murder charge sticks because if
Zapata doesn't go down, one of us just might.

14:49.231 --> 14:50.455
(KLEIN CLEARS THROAT)

14:50.456 --> 14:51.920
We better find some new evidence soon..

14:51.920 --> 14:53.890
or this trial could be over before
it starts.

14:56.076 --> 14:57.170
No pressure.

14:57.811 --> 15:00.928
So you're saying that Zapata threw
the wine glass and then left.

15:00.939 --> 15:01.178
Yeah.

15:01.189 --> 15:02.108
He never fired the shot.

15:02.171 --> 15:03.386
No..uh..I mean..

15:03.401 --> 15:05.932
I mean the reading ended before the shot was fired.

15:06.268 --> 15:07.619
Let's say..uh..

15:07.635 --> 15:10.354
let's say Dylan has rehearsed
the story so many times that when he..

15:10.365 --> 15:12.412
when he tells it-what he sees,what i saw

15:12.426 --> 15:14.678
is the fictional version of what actually happened.

15:15.201 --> 15:17.795
Which means Zapata could be telling
the truth.

15:18.530 --> 15:21.538
Jack shot Sterling and Dylan is covering for him.

15:21.608 --> 15:23.017
Let's go talk to the chef.

15:25.930 --> 15:27.709
   This is my associate Toby Logan.

15:27.725 --> 15:30.272
How you doing? I brought you some
Cannoli from Scott Chillis.

15:30.279 --> 15:32.027
I appreciate the thought but
Scott Chillis isn't quite

15:32.035 --> 15:33.211
the restaurant it used to be.

15:33.251 --> 15:35.347
Okay, well, you don't want them,
I take them home.

15:35.371 --> 15:35.929
Uh, no.

15:37.357 --> 15:38.809
No, no. That's fine, it can stay.

15:39.637 --> 15:40.781
   So what's up?

15:40.789 --> 15:44.130
You are aware that terms of your
witness protection are null and void..

15:44.156 --> 15:46.098
if you perjure yourself on the stand, right?

15:46.106 --> 15:48.408
Whoa, whoa who said anything about perjury?

15:49.361 --> 15:50.517
What did you say about this?

15:50.545 --> 15:51.925
It's a gift, if you don't want them...

15:51.940 --> 15:52.822
That's a day old.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.899
Do you see how soft the pastry is?

15:56.658 --> 15:57.778
It done for a day old.

15:58.205 --> 16:00.726
Have you been completely honest with
me and the Crown Counsel?

16:00.743 --> 16:01.890
Do you think I'm crazy..?

16:02.273 --> 16:04.371
Y-you think that I'm going to screw around
with my life on the line.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.566
You knowingly got into business with
a mob,yeah..

16:06.582 --> 16:08.992
I think you're capable of high risk behavior.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.588
What is this really about, sergeant?

16:11.940 --> 16:13.189
What, suddenly you don't trust me?

16:13.611 --> 16:15.851
I don't think trust was ever in the equation.

16:15.929 --> 16:17.241
Simple question.

16:17.857 --> 16:20.778
How did Will Sterling end up dead at
your restaurant?

16:24.408 --> 16:27.295
Sterling found out about the operation.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.856
and he wants a piece.

16:29.872 --> 16:31.342
That cannot happen.

16:31.623 --> 16:32.745
I told you he was trouble.

16:32.827 --> 16:33.885
From the begining.

16:33.977 --> 16:35.253
So let's get him down here,

16:36.097 --> 16:37.167
Right now.

16:41.345 --> 16:42.934
It was Zapata.

16:44.010 --> 16:48.900
Look I don't know how many ways
I can-I can say this.

16:50.706 --> 16:52.402
You're forgetting who's on trial here.

16:52.552 --> 16:55.167
I'm the one that's put my neck
on the line to bring down a guy

16:55.218 --> 16:56.317
that you couldn't lay a glove on.

16:56.356 --> 16:57.466
Yeah, when the trial is over..

16:57.466 --> 16:59.151
we can show our appreciation.

17:02.362 --> 17:05.205
   Well perhaps...

17:06.301 --> 17:07.720
   you could show it now.

17:09.920 --> 17:14.198
   I wanted to cook one last supper.

17:14.819 --> 17:18.970
If you will. For the three of
us who started the restaurant.

17:20.281 --> 17:21.900
   Me, Jack, Magda.

17:23.016 --> 17:24.539
   It would mean a hell of a lot to me.

17:24.546 --> 17:25.983
You're a target, Dylan.

17:25.998 --> 17:27.944
I don't think you want to show up
at your own restaurant..

17:27.959 --> 17:29.203
this close to the trial.

17:29.612 --> 17:31.100
The defence is going to scream collusion.

17:31.101 --> 17:32.565
It's over anyway.

17:32.910 --> 17:35.310
You know whether I take a bullet or end up

17:35.331 --> 17:37.716
   in some godforsaken suburbia.

17:40.077 --> 17:41.170
   I'm done.

17:43.441 --> 17:44.527
   I'm done.

17:48.483 --> 17:53.144
Dylan, Jack and Zapata met the night
before Sterling arrives.

17:53.580 --> 17:57.580
They were talking about how Sterling had found
out about the big money laundering operation.

17:57.604 --> 17:59.914
The international scheme at
Interpol turned up.

17:59.931 --> 18:03.029
Right, now I can't figure out if
Sterling wanted a cut of it..

18:03.036 --> 18:04.107
or he wanted hush money.

18:04.107 --> 18:05.770
Right, and Zapata wasn't having it.

18:05.810 --> 18:08.205
Right, neither was Jack.
So then what happened?

18:08.322 --> 18:09.361
That's it...

18:10.299 --> 18:11.262
I need another crack at them.

18:11.292 --> 18:13.171
I gotta get them when their guard's down.

18:13.211 --> 18:15.308
Yeah, okay. I just need to figure out how to..

18:15.347 --> 18:18.847
tell Isabelle all of this without letting
her know where I got my information.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.265
You'll figure it out.

18:52.197 --> 18:55.034
So you say you want to go after
the big fish

18:55.039 --> 18:58.611
well, Sterling was killed because he threatens
to expose those big fish.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.099
And you know this suddenly how?

19:00.450 --> 19:02.942
I reviewed all the physical evidence
in light of the new Interpol

19:02.960 --> 19:05.890
information including everything
Sterling left behind.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.792
He was researching a bunch of companies
the day before he died

19:08.820 --> 19:11.931
Nothing looked suspicious, we thought
he was just looking for new investments.

19:11.978 --> 19:12.478
But now...

19:12.572 --> 19:14.783
You think they could be tied
to our global money launderers.

19:14.806 --> 19:15.353
 Yeah.

19:15.423 --> 19:16.563
Okay, say...

19:16.595 --> 19:18.684
Sterling stumbled upon the bigger scheme.

19:18.723 --> 19:21.683
Maybe he went to Zapata and threatens
to expose him with it.

19:21.714 --> 19:22.751
You think?

19:23.549 --> 19:25.625
Why wouldn't Sterling go to the
authorities?

19:27.487 --> 19:30.093
Because the authorities
don't pay extortion fees.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.456
Seems like nobody's hands were clean on this one.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.613
But only one person pulled the trigger.

19:49.117 --> 19:51.028
(CHUCKLES)

19:52.388 --> 19:54.900
   Oh...

19:55.304 --> 19:57.295
So you think she knows
about us?

19:57.443 --> 20:01.507
Michelle? she's pretty smart but
I think we've been pretty discreet.

20:01.695 --> 20:04.738
Forgetting the odd copy room encounter.

20:05.098 --> 20:06.218
(LAUGH)

20:07.820 --> 20:10.961
I wish that I was as confident about her
smartness as you are..

20:12.271 --> 20:14.669
Trust me, there is nobody better.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.880
Well thanks to her I've built a case
on marginal evidence

20:19.191 --> 20:23.012
and witnesses who stand to gain from
the prosecution of Nick Zapata.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.230
Are you sure this is about the case..

20:28.261 --> 20:32.569
and it's not just about two
accomplished, ambitious women..

20:32.601 --> 20:35.085
letting their personal animosity..

20:35.086 --> 20:37.156
getting in the way of
their professional duty?

20:41.895 --> 20:42.896
We'll be history.

20:43.216 --> 20:44.614
Something I don't know about?

20:44.645 --> 20:48.936
Yeah... that's because she made sure
it never crossed your desk.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.890
We had a run in. You remember those
arrest in the financial district

20:52.890 --> 20:54.830
last Christmas?

20:55.056 --> 20:56.996
Well she accused me of grandstanding

20:57.012 --> 20:59.246
because I insisted that there was press

20:59.262 --> 21:00.126
at the perp walk.

21:01.925 --> 21:03.557
And I said something that I shouldn't.

21:05.107 --> 21:08.896
   And we never did work it out.

21:13.619 --> 21:14.725
(MOBILE RINGS)

21:14.736 --> 21:16.795
Answer it.
I'm going to take a shower.

21:16.812 --> 21:19.742
(MOBILE RINGS)

21:20.935 --> 21:24.930
(MOBILE RINGS)

21:25.833 --> 21:28.473
Hey.
(MICHELLE) Hey. Am I calling too late?

21:28.505 --> 21:30.445
No, no it's fine.

21:30.810 --> 21:31.985
   Where are you?

21:32.041 --> 21:32.610
Me?

21:32.673 --> 21:35.540
Um, um, I'm at home.

21:35.572 --> 21:38.380
I think you left the shower running.

21:38.419 --> 21:39.575
What's on your mind?

21:39.606 --> 21:41.218
I have a proposition for you.

21:41.242 --> 21:42.023
I'm all ears.

21:42.047 --> 21:42.641
Well good.

21:42.673 --> 21:46.851
Bring your ears and your playmate down here
first thing in the morning and I will explain.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.930
Crap.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.351
He wants to go back to the restaurant

21:56.367 --> 21:57.546
and cook a final meal?

21:57.562 --> 21:59.357
He is very passionate about it

21:59.389 --> 22:01.545
And of course he wants to invite the
other witnesses.

22:01.888 --> 22:05.504
Look, I know it sounds like a bad idea but
just think about it for one minute, here.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.010
   We could bug the entire place there

22:08.010 --> 22:10.886
would be no chance of them colluding
our knowing.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.674
We may learn more  in four hours than
we did in four months.

22:13.695 --> 22:15.027
And none of it's admissible.

22:15.277 --> 22:17.023
Yeah, I could seek a court order

22:17.040 --> 22:18.476
but then we risk entrapment.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.188
The wine would certainly flow, lips
would loosen.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.016
It's not the worst idea I've ever heard.

22:24.079 --> 22:26.686
I have a far more per se it concerns,
security.

22:26.731 --> 22:29.044
How much safer as he pinned to a hotel room?

22:29.160 --> 22:31.550
Look I'll make sure the entire place
is locked down.

22:31.565 --> 22:35.055
And I supposed that you would want to
chill the coversation with your presence?

22:35.125 --> 22:36.508
No, I'll have a man there.

22:36.535 --> 22:38.911
   Let me guess your behavioural whizz.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.461
Mr. Logan. Yes.

22:40.486 --> 22:42.154
Yeah, you want to prove
you're right that much.

22:42.154 --> 22:44.690
No, I want to get to the
truth that much.

22:49.029 --> 22:51.949
Dinner at eight,
back in their cages by twelve.

22:51.965 --> 22:53.596
Armed escorts both ways,

22:53.818 --> 22:56.748
All raw Intel comes directly to me.

22:56.771 --> 22:58.986
This backfires I will deny that I ever
agree to it.

23:01.532 --> 23:01.992
(CLEAR THROAT)

23:03.211 --> 23:04.852
I know we'd find some common ground.

23:09.990 --> 23:12.712
Jeez, I'll do like a cavity search for dinner.

23:13.509 --> 23:15.208
Give me a call if you need anything,
all right.

23:15.255 --> 23:16.270
Yeah, I will.

23:17.005 --> 23:18.351
Hey, let me ask you a question
before you go..

23:18.365 --> 23:19.471
Sure, what?

23:19.885 --> 23:21.541
Ryder seem like he's acting strange
to you lately?

23:21.551 --> 23:22.798
No, not really.

23:22.837 --> 23:24.314
I don't know he seems
kinda touchy.

23:24.357 --> 23:26.268
Like moody, sullen, not really himself.

23:26.284 --> 23:28.651
You know, that-it seems pretty normal to me.

23:28.706 --> 23:31.639
Look I uh..I'm a little busy with this
case right now, so I don't really want to..

23:31.655 --> 23:32.865
It's worth the shot..

23:32.899 --> 23:34.099
   I gotta go feed the ferret.

23:34.116 --> 23:34.779
Good luck with that.

23:34.794 --> 23:35.678
Huh, thanks.

23:35.695 --> 23:36.427
Thanks.

23:36.841 --> 23:37.810
Hey, how you doing?

23:38.136 --> 23:39.940
Are you sure, you don't want
to join me for dinner?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.758
No, I'm good. But uh...

23:41.789 --> 23:43.910
I'm just gonna be right around the corner
if you need anything.

23:43.910 --> 23:45.171
Okay. These guys are gonna let me in?

23:45.194 --> 23:45.991
Yeah, you good.

23:46.024 --> 23:46.858
All right.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.930
   Mr Logan, right?

23:54.930 --> 23:55.611
Yeah.

23:55.627 --> 23:56.729
I'm Jack.

23:56.745 --> 23:57.518
 What can I get you?

23:57.541 --> 24:00.002
I'll take uh two fingers
of your best Irish.

24:00.026 --> 24:01.271
   You bet.

24:03.392 --> 24:05.920
   (DYLAN) Sorry gentlemen.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.257
Jack.

24:08.491 --> 24:10.038
   I see you've met Mr Logan.

24:10.070 --> 24:11.671
Toby, you can call me Toby.

24:11.703 --> 24:13.160
Please tell me Magda's in there.

24:13.184 --> 24:13.996
She's been chopping and..

24:14.010 --> 24:15.512
   mincing since 5.

24:15.950 --> 24:16.730
   Care to see the kitchen.

24:16.738 --> 24:18.138
Sure, yeah.

24:21.631 --> 24:23.247
This is where the magic happens.

24:23.279 --> 24:23.997
Nice.

24:24.021 --> 24:25.575
Magda, this is Toby Logan.

24:25.607 --> 24:26.995
Hey, how you're doing?

24:27.895 --> 24:30.628
Toby is a cop, who is not here for food..

24:30.644 --> 24:32.256
But we'd pretend otherwise.

24:33.215 --> 24:34.168
Love Lobster.

24:34.550 --> 24:37.000
We used them to perfume
the white asparagus.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.151
Okay shoo, no one is allowed in my
kitchen..

24:39.167 --> 24:41.136
unless he prepared to work in it.

24:41.327 --> 24:43.499
It's not your kitchen yet Magda.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.782
   Sorry slip of the tongue.

24:49.335 --> 24:51.305
(DYLAN SNIFFING)

24:55.616 --> 24:58.160
   Mmm. Killer.

25:05.058 --> 25:07.404
   (OZ) Who wants to get fed?

25:07.436 --> 25:09.381
What the hell are you doing here, Mr. Bey?

25:09.404 --> 25:11.289
I came to feed the ferret, sir.
What are you doing here?

25:12.156 --> 25:13.258
I moved out.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.402
Of your house?

25:14.434 --> 25:16.473
Yes, of my house.

25:16.639 --> 25:17.759
Oh...

25:18.830 --> 25:23.970
Well, uh... may I ask the nature
of the problem?

25:24.009 --> 25:24.665
(CHUCKLES)

25:26.072 --> 25:27.472
The nature..

25:30.830 --> 25:34.000
   my wife kicked me out.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.070
 Oh that sucks.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.207
Yeah, it does.

25:40.309 --> 25:41.973
   Is it another women?

25:43.418 --> 25:44.707
No. no, um...

25:46.000 --> 25:49.213
   apparently the problem is me.

25:50.778 --> 25:54.060
   Can you believe that?
All me.

25:54.551 --> 25:56.201
And uh..

25:56.982 --> 25:58.021
My anger.

25:58.341 --> 26:00.576
   She wants me to go to...

26:01.634 --> 26:03.734
Anger management and I said no.

26:08.857 --> 26:12.455
   Well... I don't know what to say.

26:12.478 --> 26:14.891
   You can say good night Mr Bey.

26:15.001 --> 26:16.610
Okay, good night.

26:16.641 --> 26:17.942
Uh..can you feed the ferret or..

26:18.013 --> 26:20.364
You know what, I'm sure I can
take care of that.

26:20.402 --> 26:21.924
Okay, just uh..

26:21.964 --> 26:23.540
half of that bowl, should be fine.

26:23.564 --> 26:25.475
It's all right.

27:16.195 --> 27:17.990
   To my friends.

27:17.990 --> 27:20.608
   May we always remember the happier times.

27:21.155 --> 27:22.275
Salute.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.970
   I'm going to get the dessert.

27:34.860 --> 27:36.284
   Pardon me.

27:37.386 --> 27:39.953
Would you mind telling me what the
point of all this is?

27:40.276 --> 27:42.376
Oh I don't know, the end of my life
as i know it.

27:42.771 --> 27:44.247
Thought maybe I'd mark the occasion.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.112
You're not the only one whose life is
going to change.

27:46.136 --> 27:49.142
You know what Jack,
have a drink.

27:49.454 --> 27:51.087
 In fact have a bunch of drinks.

27:51.165 --> 27:52.980
Is that supposed to make it all better?

27:52.980 --> 27:55.910
Is that gonna get our lives back?
Huh, Dylan?

27:58.106 --> 28:02.272
Look, I wanted to make sure that you,
me and Magda are on the same page.

28:02.304 --> 28:02.991
That's all.

28:03.075 --> 28:06.262
How do I know that what you're
the cops is the same thing you're telling me?

28:06.286 --> 28:07.910
   Getting all paranoid on me know Jack

28:07.910 --> 28:11.699
There already asking about my being
pissed off that Sterling was brought in.

28:11.892 --> 28:13.816
We all stick to the same story.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.960
   And nobody gets hurt.

28:18.900 --> 28:21.860
Voila.
Crème Brule.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.274
Thank you.

28:24.289 --> 28:24.930
Do you mind?

28:24.969 --> 28:25.680
Of course.

28:27.323 --> 28:30.457
Listen I gotta check in
with the boss.

28:30.496 --> 28:31.488
A short leash?

28:31.526 --> 28:32.816
Something like that.

28:32.850 --> 28:34.698
   Know the feeling.

28:39.950 --> 28:42.880
Must be a little nerve wrecking with
the trial coming up.

28:44.164 --> 28:45.055
Yeah.

28:45.610 --> 28:46.313
Yeah.

28:46.421 --> 28:48.961
Takes a lot of guts to stand up
to a guy like Zapata.

28:50.471 --> 28:52.736
I'm not so sure guts is the right word.

28:53.337 --> 28:54.838
It's more like death wish.

28:57.050 --> 28:59.260
Say, this must be where you passed
Zapata, right?

28:59.833 --> 29:00.356
What?

29:00.388 --> 29:01.677
I read your deposition.

29:02.103 --> 29:04.976
You said that you passed Zapata as you
were coming into the wine bar..

29:04.992 --> 29:06.085
and he was leaving.

29:06.860 --> 29:11.030
(ZAPATA) He is going to bring
all of us down.

29:11.196 --> 29:13.016
End this right now, end it right now.

29:14.651 --> 29:15.930
Do it.

29:16.612 --> 29:18.860
(GUNSHOT)

29:30.860 --> 29:33.775
So you're saying that Jack was
actually in the wine bar..

29:33.784 --> 29:35.381
   with Dylan, Zapata and Sterling.

29:35.405 --> 29:37.928
Yeah, it was Zapata who put the gun
in Jack's hand

29:37.946 --> 29:39.852
and Jack is apparently the one who
shot Sterling.

29:39.867 --> 29:40.782
Okay, well let's see if..

29:40.797 --> 29:42.884
you can put Dylan through his
paces again.

29:42.985 --> 29:45.274
I'm gonna text you some questions
that loved to get answered.

29:45.290 --> 29:46.618
Alright, got it.

29:50.930 --> 29:54.090
Mmm... three words un freakin
believeable..

29:54.105 --> 29:55.519
This is wow..

29:55.880 --> 29:57.722
Anyone can give you the taste

29:58.029 --> 30:01.596
but it's the aromatics, the mouth feel

30:01.637 --> 30:03.132
That's what sublime.

30:03.155 --> 30:06.880
I noticed the, on your wine list,
that you got No5 Subterm.

30:07.037 --> 30:08.155
That's my favorite.

30:08.193 --> 30:09.310
Excellent choice.

30:09.358 --> 30:11.617
   I've got a bottle in the wine bar,

30:11.649 --> 30:12.546
Give me two secs.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.211
Do you mind if I join you?

30:16.760 --> 30:18.045
   Please.

30:22.076 --> 30:23.132
After you.

30:23.976 --> 30:26.686
Something on your mind Mr Logan?

30:27.860 --> 30:30.070
I don't really think you're
interested in the wine bar.

30:30.070 --> 30:32.942
No I'm not, but it's a nice
wine bar though.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.606
Just uh..I'd be cool whatever with
a few new facts.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.393
How?

30:36.441 --> 30:39.869
Yeah, we can confirm that Zapata
brought a gun to the restaurant that night.

30:40.135 --> 30:41.087
I told you that from the start,

30:41.090 --> 30:43.060
   not exactly a revelation.

30:43.060 --> 30:47.167
True but the fact that he gave it to
Jack and told him to shoot Sterling is.

30:48.437 --> 30:50.019
   No that's ridiculous.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.257
Zapata is just tying to save his skin.

30:56.224 --> 30:57.344
End it.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.905
Do it!

31:06.050 --> 31:07.990
(GUNSHOT)

31:10.186 --> 31:13.703
Jack was scared, his hands were
trembling, maybe he missed on purpose.

31:13.884 --> 31:16.110
Dylan, we know that Jack shot
Sterling.

31:16.134 --> 31:17.872
Just the first shot.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.195
All right it's the one that graced him.

31:29.571 --> 31:31.405
I didn't say anything because..

31:31.408 --> 31:33.193
I was trying to protect him.

31:34.201 --> 31:36.514
The same way we'd protect when
we were kids.

31:38.857 --> 31:42.348
Zapata shot him, the way that you
would put down a dog.

31:44.044 --> 31:46.208
He fired the only shot that mattered.

31:50.925 --> 31:52.761
   (OZ) Sir.
  I'm sorry,

31:52.769 --> 31:54.980
I've been driving around all night.
I've got to tell you something.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.452
   Tell me what?

31:56.930 --> 31:59.733
Your wife is right, sir.
Hang on...just..

31:59.740 --> 32:02.060
think about it for a second.
look how you are with me.

32:02.067 --> 32:04.893
Not just me but...
mainly me.

32:04.894 --> 32:07.681
And you know sometimes I deserve it,
but I don't think that I deserve this.

32:07.705 --> 32:08.470
I don't think anyone deserve this.

32:08.485 --> 32:09.635
Deserves what?

32:09.675 --> 32:11.386
That, that right there.

32:11.438 --> 32:13.638
You don't even know you're doing
it when you're doing it.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.604
I mean I think you should take this
anger management course..

32:15.636 --> 32:17.096
and get your life under control.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.814
You know... I care about you.
We all care about you.

32:21.890 --> 32:23.860
   Good night.

32:36.616 --> 32:38.459
Sure I knew Sterling,he was part owner.

32:38.483 --> 32:39.944
So how you swing got in the restaurant?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.741
Oh I have Dylan to thank for that one.

32:41.772 --> 32:44.831
His generousity or stupidity for
getting involved with the wrong people.

32:45.328 --> 32:47.719
   A little bit of both I guess.

32:47.777 --> 32:49.136
What do you have to do in return?

32:49.152 --> 32:51.032
Just keep up the restaurant's reputation

32:51.063 --> 32:53.196
make sure people never forget who
made it what it is.

32:53.219 --> 32:53.750
That's it?

32:53.985 --> 32:55.289
It's all you have to do?

32:55.423 --> 32:56.677
It's pretty sweet deal.

32:58.154 --> 33:01.161
Good, he bought it.
And so will the jury.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.528
Only I don't buy it.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.790
Neither will the jury.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.548
   Hey, so tell me you have something.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.751
I think we have a game changer here.

33:12.775 --> 33:14.980
I think you may want to reconsider
your dinner invitation.

33:23.064 --> 33:25.501
That's Dylan's story,
and Magda sticking to it.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.810
Well, if she is lying,
than Dylan is too.

33:27.826 --> 33:28.583
Right.

33:29.769 --> 33:31.152
   I already told you everything

33:31.168 --> 33:32.238
Why would I lie?

33:32.254 --> 33:33.859
Maybe to get off from the shadow
of Dylan?

33:34.305 --> 33:36.015
Take over the restaurant
without having to lift a finger?

33:36.020 --> 33:37.990
   I wouldn't do that.

33:37.990 --> 33:40.920
You know that the restaurant was
used to launder money.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.860
I stayed out of the business side
of things.

33:42.870 --> 33:45.033
Well, Dylan had a lot ot hide
and he needed help.

33:45.048 --> 33:48.006
I had to backup (inaudible),
I didn't want to, I never wanted to.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.970
We know he made you lie.

33:49.970 --> 33:52.900
All three of your stories are in
sync for a reason.

33:56.861 --> 33:59.869
You still say that you saw Zapata
leave the restaurant

33:59.890 --> 34:01.297
after the shot were fired?

34:01.970 --> 34:03.910
    (ESP) After the first shot yes.

34:04.246 --> 34:06.832
Everyone says that there was two shots
one after another

34:06.835 --> 34:10.257
but I'm beginning to think that maybe
there was times between the two shots.

34:10.558 --> 34:12.768
It's gonna come out either here or
in court,

34:12.771 --> 34:15.853
the different is you'll face perjury
once you've been sworn.

34:24.556 --> 34:28.338
Zapata was literally walking out
of the restaurant...

34:30.067 --> 34:31.841
   when the second shot was fired.

34:31.857 --> 34:34.989
That only leaves person left with
Sterling.

34:47.454 --> 34:48.804
I'll be ready in a minute.

34:48.829 --> 34:51.079
You're not going anywhere
until you tell us the truth.

34:55.697 --> 34:57.135
I've told you the truth.

34:57.143 --> 34:58.104
Several versions.

34:58.111 --> 35:01.043
Yeah, stitched together from bits and
pieces from what actually happened.

35:01.061 --> 35:03.989
Look, I-I really don't know what you're
hoping to get from me

35:04.007 --> 35:05.827
that I haven't already told you.

35:05.859 --> 35:07.630
You bought Magda's silence with
the restaurant.

35:07.654 --> 35:09.529
You falsified Jack's involvement.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.584
So what else aren't you telling us?

35:11.584 --> 35:12.878
    (ESP) They know.

35:17.890 --> 35:20.020
(GUNSHOT)

35:21.644 --> 35:23.604
(GLASS BREAKING)

35:26.788 --> 35:30.206
We had a good thing covered. Why you'd
have to go and ruin it?

35:30.925 --> 35:32.865
(GUNSHOT)

35:33.670 --> 35:36.600
No...
you shot him.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.236
What?

35:39.267 --> 35:40.080
You shot him....

35:40.080 --> 35:42.020
and you framed Zapata.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.217
    (ESP) Who set me up?

35:51.377 --> 35:53.587
I even know where you hid the gun.

35:58.597 --> 36:00.996
When Sterling found out how much
money Zapata was making

36:01.011 --> 36:03.070
from the money laundering he
wanted in.

36:03.512 --> 36:05.793
He knew who is he getting in bed with
right from the beginning.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.207
That's not what his wife said.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.040
Well then, she's either a liar

36:08.048 --> 36:09.361
   or blind.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.880
Then, I take it Zapata didn't want
to share the wealth.

36:17.168 --> 36:19.924
   Zapata gave the gun to Jack...

36:20.394 --> 36:21.910
just like he said.

36:23.161 --> 36:25.122
   Told him to shoot.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.990
   Jack's always been the tough guy.

36:30.960 --> 36:34.123
But he didn't have the stomach to
kill a man like that.

36:35.302 --> 36:36.513
But you did.

36:50.481 --> 36:52.611
(KNOCKING)

36:52.959 --> 36:54.045
Good morning.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.900
Am I the only one who
thinks a celebration is in order?

36:58.429 --> 37:01.054
You know that was very clever of you
setting up the scene of the crime

37:01.060 --> 37:02.349
   so that Dylan would confess.

37:02.364 --> 37:04.621
Well thank you, if you hadn't signed
off on the dinner

37:04.629 --> 37:06.262
none of this would have 
been possible.

37:06.278 --> 37:07.676
This is a surprise.

37:07.692 --> 37:08.528
What?

37:08.880 --> 37:12.070
Oh nothing, nothing it's just nice
to see you two getting along.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.009
Why wouldn't we get along?

37:14.020 --> 37:17.204
Yeah, two strong women
expressing our opinions

37:17.228 --> 37:18.932
doing our jobs.

37:18.964 --> 37:21.764
Why wouldn't we be supportive of one another?

37:21.840 --> 37:24.871
No... I just mean...
uh...

37:25.011 --> 37:26.020
What do you mean?

37:26.020 --> 37:26.896
I have no idea.

37:26.904 --> 37:27.960
That's what I thought.

37:27.960 --> 37:28.638
I gotta go.

37:28.654 --> 37:29.638
I'll call you about lunch.

37:29.662 --> 37:31.062
Terrific.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.890
   Hey.

37:43.072 --> 37:43.861
Hi.

37:44.173 --> 37:45.564
Look, I'm uh...

37:46.960 --> 37:49.349
I really overreacted about the
whole thing.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.028
I mean..

37:50.052 --> 37:53.041
How were you supposed to know that
I was allergic to furry things..

37:53.065 --> 37:55.706
(OZ COUGH)

37:57.024 --> 37:57.914
So..

37:57.930 --> 38:00.437
I was thinking maybe if you're
free tonight..that..

38:00.461 --> 38:02.099
Yes, I am, I'm free.

38:02.123 --> 38:02.943
(CLEAR THROAT)

38:02.950 --> 38:05.408
C'mon no not again.Billie.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.743
Excuse you. You all right?

38:07.760 --> 38:08.809
Guys?

38:08.833 --> 38:09.953
Okay..

38:10.333 --> 38:11.785
Is there a problem?

38:12.222 --> 38:13.050
Okay, no...

38:13.066 --> 38:14.246
You okay ma'am?

38:14.285 --> 38:15.769
Sir, it's okay.

38:15.784 --> 38:17.985
Oh, she's allergic to them, I'm sorry
about that.

38:18.488 --> 38:19.608
Uh.. Mr. Bey.

38:19.782 --> 38:20.477
Yes, sir..

38:20.562 --> 38:23.085
Um..you know I'm just booking out
from the ambulance

38:23.101 --> 38:24.725
take this little guy home 
to see the kids.

38:24.757 --> 38:25.963
That's great, sir.

38:25.987 --> 38:28.087
I just wanted to say..um...

38:28.900 --> 38:29.719
 Well...

38:29.875 --> 38:30.840
Thank you.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.030
   It's no problem sir.

38:34.342 --> 38:35.651
Have fun with Cynthia.

38:35.652 --> 38:36.960
She's a girl?

38:36.960 --> 38:38.930
I guess.
