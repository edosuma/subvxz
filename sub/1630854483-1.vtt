WEBVTT

01:03.481 --> 01:06.108
NARRATOR: Welcome,
explorers, to Avalonia.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.693
A modest civilization

01:07.777 --> 01:09.487
trapped behind an impassable ring

01:09.570 --> 01:11.363
of never-ending mountains,

01:11.530 --> 01:13.491
whose citizens strive to do their best

01:13.574 --> 01:15.326
despite their humble means.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.412
Believing the key to their future

01:18.496 --> 01:20.206
lies beyond these mountains,

01:20.372 --> 01:22.333
many have tried to get past them.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.419
All have failed.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.962
But hope has arrived,

01:27.046 --> 01:30.466
as Avalonia's greatest
explorers, the Clades,

01:30.633 --> 01:33.928
have now set their sights
on pulling off the impossible.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.305
Meet Jaeger Clade!

01:36.639 --> 01:38.057
Jaeger Clade

01:38.140 --> 01:39.350
Jaeger Clade

01:39.767 --> 01:42.686
Never heard the meaning
Of the word afraid

01:42.853 --> 01:44.188
Hard as nails

01:44.355 --> 01:45.731
Blazing trails

01:45.898 --> 01:47.608
Staring danger in the eyes

01:47.775 --> 01:50.903
He's the manliest of guys
Jaeger Clade

01:51.070 --> 01:52.238
The one and only!

01:52.404 --> 01:54.490
NARRATOR:
And who's this by his side?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.284
Why, it's none other than
his bouncing baby boy,

01:57.368 --> 01:58.369
Searcher.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.288
MALE CHORUS: Searcher Clade
Searcher Clade

02:01.455 --> 02:04.416
Joining Dad
on every new crusade

02:04.583 --> 02:05.876
Iron-willed

02:06.043 --> 02:07.419
Smaller build

02:07.586 --> 02:09.088
He's the apple from the tree

02:09.255 --> 02:10.548
With a thing for botany

02:10.631 --> 02:12.383
Searcher Clade

02:12.758 --> 02:14.760
NARRATOR: Together,
these two are destined

02:14.844 --> 02:16.095
to finally find a route

02:16.178 --> 02:18.305
through these impassable peaks.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.516
No matter the cost.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.227
Over rugged mountains crawling

02:23.310 --> 02:26.146
Or raging waters falling
In cascades

02:26.272 --> 02:27.731
They're the Clades

02:27.815 --> 02:32.194
On their daring escapades

02:32.444 --> 02:33.946
They're the Clades

02:38.325 --> 02:39.827
All right, Searcher,

02:39.910 --> 02:41.579
the path to the other side
of the mountains

02:41.662 --> 02:44.331
is through this cave.
How are you holding up?

02:44.415 --> 02:47.042
Great. Pretty sure
all my toes are frozen off

02:47.126 --> 02:48.586
so at least they don't hurt anymore.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.172
Well, as I always say,
"Exploration is snow joke."

02:52.256 --> 02:53.883
-Wow.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.634
-Shelter!
-JAEGER: Ooh!

02:55.718 --> 02:57.887
This is exactly what we need.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.143
Sorry! Sorry.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.853
-

03:10.024 --> 03:11.108
Shh.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.558
Whoa.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.227
-What are you?
-

03:47.311 --> 03:48.771
-

03:51.148 --> 03:52.191
Run!

03:59.657 --> 04:01.200
-Searcher!

04:09.833 --> 04:10.834
Dad.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.545
-JAEGER: Got ya.
-

04:14.213 --> 04:16.256
-

04:22.554 --> 04:25.265
Another close call, eh, Searcher?

04:29.895 --> 04:31.438
Do you see that, everyone?

04:31.981 --> 04:34.984
They'll be telling our story
for generations to come!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.111
For what lies beyond that horizon

04:37.194 --> 04:40.364
is Avalonia's future and our glory.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.448
Hey, Dad.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.283
What about these plants?

04:43.367 --> 04:45.494
There's literally power
surging through them.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.791
Well, Searcher, I do love
your inquisitive spirit,

04:50.874 --> 04:52.876
but our crew didn't come all this way

04:52.960 --> 04:56.171
just to get distracted
by some sparkly plants.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.715
Yes, Dad,

04:57.798 --> 05:01.468
but "our crew" did come
out here to make a discovery

05:01.552 --> 05:02.761
that could change Avalonia.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.221
-Right?
-

05:04.304 --> 05:06.390
The discovery "our crew" is looking for

05:06.473 --> 05:09.018
is on the other side of these mountains

05:09.101 --> 05:11.478
because that's Avalonia's future.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.857
But if "our crew" would just
take a look at these plants...

05:14.940 --> 05:16.066
-Ooh.
-...they could see

05:16.150 --> 05:18.819
that Avalonia's future
might be right here.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.738
This crew has been training

05:20.821 --> 05:23.490
since they were a baby to do one thing.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.950
-Cartography.
-Nope.

05:25.034 --> 05:29.329
And that one thing is to walk
with me beyond that horizon.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.790
But did you ever bother
to even ask "the crew"

05:31.874 --> 05:33.083
if that's what they really wanted?

05:33.167 --> 05:36.295
Oh, they're not really talking
about the crew, are they?

05:36.378 --> 05:39.590
Searcher, we're explorers, not gardeners.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.885
Conquering those mountains is our legacy.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.470
No, Dad. It's yours.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.680
Enough. You're my son.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.057
But I'm not you.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.102
I'm not you.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.731
I don't mean to interrupt,

05:55.814 --> 05:57.524
but I actually think Baby Clade's right.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.609
Callisto?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.403
Jaeger, we don't actually know
what's past the mountains.

06:01.487 --> 06:04.031
But these plants here are real.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.700
We owe it to Avalonia
to see what they can do.

06:13.665 --> 06:14.750
Here.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.252
You'll need this to find your way home.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.587
What?

06:20.422 --> 06:21.548
Jaeger.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.883
Come back.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.551
Dad, wait.

06:24.635 --> 06:25.677
-CALLISTO: Jaeger.
-Dad.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.763
CALLISTO: You can't survive
out there alone.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.181
SEARCHER: Dad, stop!

06:47.491 --> 06:50.119
-

07:03.590 --> 07:04.842
Morning, Mr. Clade.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
Rory, Mr. Clade
was my dad's name.

07:07.511 --> 07:08.512
Call me Searcher.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.681
I can't do that, Mr. Clade.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.392
That would be disrespectful
to the father of Pando.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.893
If it weren't for what you discovered,

07:14.977 --> 07:17.020
there'd be no power, or lights, or cars,

07:17.104 --> 07:19.231
-or radios, or...
-Okay, okay. Thanks, Rory.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.900
Ugh, I enjoy our little talks.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.193
Bye, Mr. Clade.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.616
Good morning, Avalonia!

07:29.700 --> 07:31.660
It looks like after a week of downpours,

07:31.827 --> 07:34.496
we finally have a beautiful,
sunny day ahead of us.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.665
MAN: Which is great
for all you Pando farmers out there.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.458
You need to harvest those crops.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.127
WOMAN: Yeah,
let's not run out of Pando.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.587
No Pando means no power.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.547
MAN: Back to horse and buggy?
No, thank you!

07:43.714 --> 07:44.965
I like my airship.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.051
Meridian! Ethan! Breakfast!

07:48.218 --> 07:49.928
MAN: In other news,
President Callisto Mal

07:50.012 --> 07:51.805
is getting ready
for a much-deserved vacation.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.018
-Morning, babe.
-Coffee first.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.312
-Good morning later.
-I got you.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.567
MERIDIAN: Mm...
ETHAN: Ew.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.027
This is the first image

08:05.110 --> 08:07.070
that has to be imprinted
on my brain this morning?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.281
Oh, Ethan, does this bother you?

08:09.364 --> 08:11.450
Ugh, impossible.
I mean, what 16-year-old boy

08:11.533 --> 08:13.243
doesn't like seeing
their parents smooch?

08:13.327 --> 08:15.204
-MERIDIAN: Mm-hmm.
-Okay, okay! Ugh.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.288
You know, I hope you know

08:16.371 --> 08:18.040
that you're emotionally
scarring Legend.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.125
Yeah.
He looks real upset.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.419
Looks like someone

08:22.502 --> 08:24.087
forgot to weed the north field.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.923
Father, what is a weed

08:26.089 --> 08:27.799
other than a plant
growing somewhere

08:27.883 --> 08:29.885
that you find inconvenient?

08:29.968 --> 08:32.221
Ah, I appreciate how clever you are.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.931
But you know
what I'd appreciate more?

08:34.139 --> 08:36.099
If I weeded the north field?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.851
You see? So clever.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.937
-ETHAN: Come on!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
Whoo!
-

09:04.711 --> 09:05.712
SEARCHER: Ha-ha!
ETHAN: Hey!

09:05.796 --> 09:06.797
SEARCHER: Come on!

09:10.384 --> 09:12.052
-

09:23.981 --> 09:25.232
MERIDIAN: Searcher!

09:27.609 --> 09:30.153
-Hey, hon. What's up?
-Oh, my engine stalled out.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.363
Can you give me a hand?

09:32.364 --> 09:33.740
Too much hotdoggin', huh?

09:33.824 --> 09:35.951
Is there such a thing?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.038
Hmm. Pando battery's dead.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.707
That doesn't make any sense.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.750
I picked those pods an hour ago.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.211
Eh, pest must be gettin'
in the root system again.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.088
Well, I'll give our field
some extra love

09:48.255 --> 09:49.715
as soon as I get the duster
back in the air.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.591
-BOY: Ethan!
-

09:52.884 --> 09:54.011
Hey, the crew's here.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.679
Ethan's crew. Not your crew.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.472
Yeah, but his friends love me.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.057
No, we talked about this.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.184
Ethan's a teenager. Boundaries.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.644
Yeah, yeah. Boundaries. Got it.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.356
-Ethan.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.150
-What's up, Ethan?
-Whoa! Ethan, Ethan.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.901
Kardez, Kardez, what?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.528
We just came back
from the game shop.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.031
The special edition of
Primal Outpost just dropped.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.074
They sold out in 15 minutes.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.118
What? They sold out already?

10:18.201 --> 10:19.619
Argh, I knew
I should've camped out.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.164
Don't worry.
We didn't forget about you.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.334
Hey, Diazo.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.501
I didn't see you there.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.253
Not that you're not noticeable.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.756
I just, um, it was just, uh...

10:30.839 --> 10:31.840
What's up? Hey.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.383
I knew you had to work
this morning

10:33.467 --> 10:35.385
so I made sure
we grabbed you a pack.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.513
You did?
That's... That's really sweet.

10:38.597 --> 10:39.681
GIRL: Ugh.
Okay, we have allotted

10:39.765 --> 10:41.975
three to five minutes
of cute flirtation.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.185
Can we open our packs already?

10:43.352 --> 10:45.437
Yo, I hear
the new creatures are steep.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.647
Medic.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.817
I'm gonna make some stuff.

10:50.984 --> 10:51.985
ETHAN: Farmer.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.615
Here, I'll trade you.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.701
This one feels more Ethan to me.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.958
Isn't your grandpa,
like, a famous explorer?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.211
Maybe it's in your blood.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.712
-ETHAN: Hmm.
-

11:10.796 --> 11:12.214
He kinda looks like you.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.966
Except for that.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.885
No! Hey, Diazo.
-

11:16.968 --> 11:19.096
-Give it back.
-

11:19.179 --> 11:21.264
Hey, gang. What's the haps?

11:21.348 --> 11:22.808
Dad, what are you doing?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.267
-Ooh, is this him?
- Dad. No.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.352
-'Sup.
-No.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.853
-I'm Ethan's dad, Searcher.
-

11:28.480 --> 11:29.981
You must be Diazo.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.191
He talks about you all the time.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.901
Not all the time.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.695
Maybe sometimes or on occasion.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.030
So, Diazo.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.240
Tell me about yourself.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.741
That's not really necessary.

11:39.825 --> 11:40.909
Are you into farming?

11:40.992 --> 11:42.536
Because Ethan
is an amazing farmer.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.829
-You should see him out there.
-Huh?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.581
He's strong, smart, super cool.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.126
Or as you kids say, steep.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.336
-Wow.
-Okay.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.587
Don't we have
some deliveries to make?

11:52.671 --> 11:55.173
-Oh, right. Right.
-Sorry, guys. We gotta go now.

11:55.257 --> 11:59.052
Apologies that my dad
is so dad. Bye.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.971
-DIAZO: Bye, Ethan.
-Farewell, Ethan.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.222
Bye, Ethan's dad.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.599
Hey, Diazo seems cool.
I see why you like him.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.476
-Please stop talking.
-I remember my first crush.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.562
-Why are you still talking?
-She had braces, I did too.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.729
-Stop. Please.
-And then one time

12:09.813 --> 12:11.022
-we got stuck...
-

12:11.106 --> 12:12.399
SEARCHER: ...and it wasn't
such a bad thing.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.151
ETHAN: What is happening
to my life?

12:34.713 --> 12:35.755
Hey!

12:38.467 --> 12:39.509
Hey!

12:49.019 --> 12:50.187
Thanks, Searcher.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.354
Oh, thanks, Ethan.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.689
Thank you.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.998
-There you go.
-Thanks, Searcher.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.334
-Legend, go get it.
-WOMAN: Wow.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.044
Would you look at that.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.213
Three generations of Clades.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.548
I wonder which one Ethan takes after.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.342
I think that's pretty obvious.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.474
You know, he's gonna grow up
to be just like me.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.434
And leave you, just like I did.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.145
Ugh!

13:35.982 --> 13:37.234
You okay, Searcher?

13:37.567 --> 13:38.818
Oh, yep, yeah.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.862
Uh, we'll see you next week, Ro.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.864
Come on, Ethan. Let's go.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.830
You know, I bet your dad
would be really proud

13:50.914 --> 13:52.123
of everything you've accomplished.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.627
You clearly don't know anything

13:55.710 --> 13:56.753
about your grandpa.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.381
I mean, I would
if you ever talked about him.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.801
-Hmm.
-Dad, he's my grandfather.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.261
I want to know about him.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.470
From you.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.100
Everyone thinks of Jaeger Clade

14:10.183 --> 14:11.351
as this amazing hero.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.896
But that's only because
they didn't have him as a father.

14:15.897 --> 14:19.693
To me, he was
just a really bad dad.

14:20.652 --> 14:21.778
And he didn't care about me,

14:21.861 --> 14:24.406
he only cared about
conquering those mountains.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.659
And I only care about you,

14:27.826 --> 14:30.412
our family and our farm.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.750
Well, I guess that's what
makes you a pretty good dad.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.043
Wait. What was that?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.211
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.838
I opened my mouth
and no words came out.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.464
-Actually, Legend, did you...
-No, no, no. Nope.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
I heard you. You said
I'm a really good dad.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.510
Pretty good. Pretty good.

14:45.594 --> 14:49.306
My son thinks I'm an amazing dad!

14:58.857 --> 15:00.317
Ha-ha! Whoo!

15:01.401 --> 15:03.069
Ooh!

15:07.365 --> 15:08.908
-I'm right here.
-

15:15.624 --> 15:16.625
Mmm.

15:38.647 --> 15:39.981
-What?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.612
Whoa! What kind of airship is that?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.114
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like it.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.075
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

15:50.241 --> 15:52.077
No, you're damaging our crops!

16:00.335 --> 16:02.671
Baby Clade, hey.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.923
Oh, how long has it been?

16:05.006 --> 16:06.633
-Callisto?
-You know her?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.385
Yeah. She used to work with my dad.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.929
What is the leader of Avalonia
doing in our front yard?

16:11.012 --> 16:13.223
-I don't know.
-Aw, get in here.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.100
-So good to see you, man.
-

16:15.266 --> 16:16.267
-Ugh!
-You too.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.144
-You must be Meridian.
-Oh. Yes.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.063
-So lovely to meet you.
-Great meeting you.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.523
-And Ethan.
-

16:21.606 --> 16:23.024
The future of Clade Farms.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.276
Oh, your dad must be so proud.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.280
Oh, hey, is it okay if we park
the Venture here?

16:29.447 --> 16:31.408
You know, I can tell my pilot to move it.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.617
It's not a big deal.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.369
I mean, it is a big deal,
but it's not a big deal.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.745
No, it's... it's fine.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.580
Uh, can the Venture fly
over the mountains?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.291
Well, sorry.
Nothing can fly that high.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.252
Well, not yet anyways.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.586
But that's not why I'm here.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.714
Uh, why are you here?

16:46.214 --> 16:47.882
There's something I need to show you.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.802
Where did you find these?

16:50.885 --> 16:53.012
It started in the northeast territory,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.807
and it's been spreading
like wildfire ever since.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.518
According to our estimates,
every crop will be infected

16:58.601 --> 16:59.894
within a month.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.229
Including your farm.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.191
Searcher, I'm mounting
an expedition to save Pando,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.152
and I want you to come with me.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.863
Callisto, I don't go on expeditions.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.072
I'm not my father.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.409
Yeah. He didn't come back, you did.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.536
And you brought back a miracle.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.705
And now there's something
wrong with it.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.590
Look at how they glow out there.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.302
It's like a heartbeat, isn't it?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.512
Searcher,

17:35.513 --> 17:37.056
I was there when you found Pando.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.018
Look what it's given us.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.396
Airships, the lights in our homes.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.315
But most importantly,

17:45.482 --> 17:48.485
it showed us our future
wasn't out there somewhere,

17:48.651 --> 17:49.652
but here.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.906
Pando's dying, Searcher.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.073
You and I,

17:54.824 --> 17:56.576
we have an obligation to save it.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.708
-

18:08.838 --> 18:10.215
Okay.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.800
Yes. When do we head out?

18:11.883 --> 18:14.135
Whoa, whoa. Hold up.
You're not coming with me.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.637
But we do everything together.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.721
Not this.

18:16.805 --> 18:17.806
Then what's the point
of you showing me

18:17.889 --> 18:19.224
how to grow Pando my whole life?

18:19.307 --> 18:20.725
So you can take over the farm.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.393
But this is so much more important.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.686
-No.
-But, Dad.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.438
I will not risk your life.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.565
Not now, not ever.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.444
-Ethan.
-

18:31.528 --> 18:32.529
Ethan.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.780
-

18:33.863 --> 18:35.907
-Unfortunately, Searcher,

18:36.074 --> 18:39.410
every second we delay
puts Avalonia in grave danger.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.831
Let me go get my things.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.677
WOMAN: All right, everyone.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.054
President Mal is about to give
us our mission parameters.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.390
Uh, Mr. Clade, my name's Caspian.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.183
-I'm a huge fan...
-Oh, thank you.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.643
-...of your dad.
-

19:45.727 --> 19:47.520
Do you think you could forge
his autograph?

19:47.604 --> 19:48.605
-What?
-WOMAN: Listen up.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.023
Thank you, Captain Pulk.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.191
Though Pando seems
to be thousands of plants

19:52.275 --> 19:53.735
here on the surface,

19:53.818 --> 19:56.821
underground, it is actually
a singular organism

19:56.988 --> 19:59.032
with an inter-connected root system.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.659
We believe whatever's making Pando sick

20:01.826 --> 20:04.954
is attacking it deep within
this system at its heart.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.831
Three weeks ago,
Captain Pulk here

20:06.915 --> 20:08.875
tracked the roots out to the Atlas Range,

20:09.042 --> 20:11.210
where they suddenly took a turn downward.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.421
They started excavating,

20:13.504 --> 20:14.547
but the ground gave out,

20:14.631 --> 20:17.175
revealing an even bigger mystery.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.930
Our mission is to follow these roots

20:22.096 --> 20:23.932
until we reach the heart of Pando

20:24.015 --> 20:25.892
and stop whatever's harming it.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.019
So, how far does it go down?

20:28.102 --> 20:29.395
We're not sure.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.565
But Avalonia's future
depends on us finding out.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.068
Psst. Clade, come here, listen.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.904
We, uh... We got no idea
what's down there.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.740
If you wanna back out,
I could drop you off.

20:40.823 --> 20:41.908
Wait, seriously?

20:41.991 --> 20:44.577
No, I'm just messin' with you.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.080
Look at your face. Oh!

20:47.163 --> 20:48.498
We need you to figure this out,

20:48.581 --> 20:49.582
otherwise, we're doomed.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.710
Lieutenant Duffle,

20:52.877 --> 20:55.588
can you please earn your paycheck
and fly us down?

20:56.798 --> 20:57.799
Yes, Captain Pulk.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.075
Hmm?

21:34.502 --> 21:35.503
Whoa.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.756
Whew.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.511
Whoa.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.651
Whoa. Wow. It's beautiful.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.281
Oh, I wish everyone
in Avalonia could see this.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.365
Searcher!

22:05.616 --> 22:06.617
What is that?

22:06.701 --> 22:08.244
Whatever it is,
it knows your name.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.495
-WOMAN: Searcher!
-

22:09.787 --> 22:10.872
Searcher!

22:10.955 --> 22:13.166
What? Meridian?
What are you doin' down here?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.418
I've been trying to flag you down
for the last four hours.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.838
Our son is on your ship.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.631
What did she just say?
Honey, what are you saying?

22:20.715 --> 22:21.716
What is she saying?

22:21.799 --> 22:23.718
She said your son is on our ship.

22:23.801 --> 22:24.927
-Hey, Mom.
-Ethan?

22:25.094 --> 22:26.095
Oh, hey, Dad.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.181
You brought the dog?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.515
What...
What are you doing here?

22:29.599 --> 22:30.850
Look, Dad. I just wanna help.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.102
Ethan, we talked about this. I can't.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.313
I need you to take care
of the farm while I'm gone.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.315
Now, please, go home with Mom.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.441
Wait, but, Dad.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.779
-

22:45.656 --> 22:46.699
What is happening?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.451
ETHAN: Dad,
what are those things?

22:48.618 --> 22:50.661
Head inside. I got this.

22:50.745 --> 22:51.788
-

22:54.332 --> 22:56.375
-

23:02.381 --> 23:04.675
-

23:07.637 --> 23:10.389
Hey, razor face.
Yeah, come and get me.

23:10.473 --> 23:11.682
Oh, no.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.436
Duffle, get us out of here.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.531
-

23:41.254 --> 23:42.255
Hold on!

23:43.131 --> 23:44.465
-Legend!
-

23:46.634 --> 23:47.885
Oh. Whoa!

24:26.632 --> 24:27.800
Brace yourself.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.013
-Dad!

24:38.477 --> 24:40.313
-Dad!
-Ethan!

24:45.318 --> 24:47.320
-We're comin' in too hot.
-I know.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.995
Come on, Venture. Hang in there.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.292
-

25:07.673 --> 25:08.716
Not today.

25:30.613 --> 25:34.408
Did you have any idea
all of this was down here?

25:35.952 --> 25:36.953
Not at all.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.997
We are definitely off the map now.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.835
Okay, they're okay.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.337
And we're okay.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.588
-

25:47.672 --> 25:50.424
Oh, yes, yes.
Look, I know, I'm happy too.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.009
Easy on the tongue.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.803
-Easy on the tongue. Easy.
-

26:04.313 --> 26:06.065
Whoa. Wow.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.300
This place is amazing.

26:32.383 --> 26:33.551
-

26:33.634 --> 26:36.637
No. Hey, Legend, Legend.
Leave it, leave it.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.181
Hey, hey, we have no idea
what that is.

26:39.348 --> 26:40.599
Get that out of your mouth.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.311
All right, boy.

26:43.394 --> 26:44.520
Phew.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.147
Let's get back to our family.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.481
-What?
-

26:49.608 --> 26:51.152
What in the...?

26:51.235 --> 26:52.278
Yuck.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.071
-

26:54.155 --> 26:56.365
-Hey, Legend, get back here.

26:58.326 --> 26:59.327
Whoa!

27:26.604 --> 27:28.064
Hi, uh, hello.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.984
I'm a human being from the top world.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.404
You probably don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

27:35.905 --> 27:38.115
Pfft! Of course I understand you.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.200
What do you think I am,

27:39.283 --> 27:40.493
one of those mindless monsters?

27:40.868 --> 27:42.370
-Huh?
-That's right, bub.

27:42.453 --> 27:47.166
You're in the presence
of the one, the only Jaeger...

27:47.249 --> 27:48.250
Dad?

27:48.793 --> 27:49.794
Dad?

27:55.383 --> 27:56.384
CALLISTO: Okay, everyone.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.804
We are clearly in uncharted territory.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.015
I know you're all
feeling scared. I am too.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.059
But the mission remains the same.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.395
We're here to save Pando, okay?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.063
But before we can do that,

28:09.146 --> 28:11.065
we need to get our ship
back into the air.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.274
What about my dad?

28:12.358 --> 28:13.651
Shouldn't we be saving him first?

28:13.734 --> 28:15.986
He's a farmer. You can't
just leave him out there.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.656
No one's leaving anyone.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.408
I know you're worried
about your dad,

28:20.574 --> 28:23.244
but I've seen him
out in the field firsthand.

28:23.411 --> 28:25.121
He knows how to survive.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.288
If we want to do the same,

28:26.372 --> 28:28.541
our best bet is to retrieve him by air.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.460
Which means fixing this ship
is the priority.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.045
But that's gonna take way too long.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.713
-She's right, Ethan.
-What?

28:34.797 --> 28:35.881
No, I know, I know.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.925
But, babe, we have no idea
what's out here.

28:38.092 --> 28:39.510
The Venture is our safest option.

28:39.677 --> 28:40.678
-But, Mom.
-Honey,

28:40.761 --> 28:42.346
why don't you go hang out
in the cockpit

28:42.430 --> 28:43.472
while I help them with repairs?

28:43.973 --> 28:46.809
I promise you, Ethan,
we're gonna save your dad.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.147
Thanks for the backup.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.648
I'm gonna hold you to that promise.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.608
You have your assignments, get moving.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.527
Caspian, can you keep
an eye on Ethan?

28:56.694 --> 28:59.113
Come on, Ethan. We're gonna
have the best time.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.531
You like board games, right?

29:00.614 --> 29:01.949
We have the best games.

29:02.116 --> 29:05.369
Rung and Rafters,
Candy Jams, Battletrip.

29:05.703 --> 29:08.330
Nope, no. No, no. Mm-mm.
You're not my son.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.665
What?
What are you talking about?

29:09.832 --> 29:12.209
You're probably
just some oddly-shaped rock

29:12.293 --> 29:14.753
that my eyes
want to believe is a person.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.339
I am not an oddly-shaped rock.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.176
That's exactly what
an oddly-shaped rock would say.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.635
Wow, okay.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.054
Well, would
an oddly-shaped rock know

29:24.221 --> 29:26.390
that you gave me a machete
for my birthday?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.227
Classic, Jaeger Clade.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.396
-I was two.
-Hmm.

29:33.647 --> 29:34.815
I'm real, Dad.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.609
It's really me.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.446
Your son, Searcher.

29:48.704 --> 29:49.997
Searcher?

29:52.458 --> 29:55.377
This is incredible.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.546
-I was thinkin' the same.
-Hmm.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.132
-

30:03.219 --> 30:05.346
Oh, that means that flying machine

30:05.429 --> 30:08.224
that crashed is also real?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.558
Yeah.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.645
Well, let's get moving.
We've got no time to lose.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.812
Whoa, wait.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.607
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, hey!

30:17.149 --> 30:18.400
Will you get that off your head?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.111
-Ugh!

30:23.948 --> 30:24.990
There you go.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.743
It's not pretty, but, uh,
it'll get us back airborne.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.620
I gotta say, Meridian,

30:29.787 --> 30:32.957
for a crop duster,
you are one gutsy pilot.

30:33.374 --> 30:34.833
Well, the three things
I love the most

30:34.917 --> 30:37.962
are my family, my farm,
and flying.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.756
Now if that last thing
could protect the other two,

30:40.839 --> 30:42.883
I'd fly through fire.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.720
-Um, Mrs. Clade?
-Yeah, what's up?

30:46.804 --> 30:49.181
Remember how I was given
the crucial responsibility

30:49.265 --> 30:50.307
of watching your son?

30:50.391 --> 30:51.600
Is he givin' you trouble?

30:51.767 --> 30:53.686
Just send him back to me.
I'll put him to work.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.146
Oh, I would love to do that.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.357
Except, I don't know where he is.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.608
BOTH: What?

30:59.775 --> 31:02.152
ETHAN: Dad! Dad! Whoa!

31:03.988 --> 31:05.739
Uh... Oh!

31:05.823 --> 31:08.242
This is way faster than our tractor.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.077
I gotta get me one of these.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.252
Whoa.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.026
Whoa.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.861
Huh.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.904
A vast, undiscovered wilderness

31:45.988 --> 31:48.616
filled with fantastic creatures.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.578
This is just like Primal Outpost.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.292
-

32:12.222 --> 32:15.809
Okay, this is nothing
like Primal Outpost.

32:50.761 --> 32:51.887
You can do this, Ethan.

32:52.513 --> 32:53.555
Just be brave.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.307
It's in your blood.

33:12.825 --> 33:13.826
I'm alive.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.290
Oh, hey, Diazo.

33:20.374 --> 33:21.667
How was my weekend? Pfft.

33:21.750 --> 33:22.751
What did I do?

33:22.835 --> 33:24.878
Oh, yeah, I just ran through
a nightmare tunnel

33:24.962 --> 33:26.797
to rescue my dad.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.590
No big deal. Yeah.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.175
-

33:31.093 --> 33:33.220
-Hello?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.025
-

33:47.776 --> 33:49.153
-

33:51.321 --> 33:53.532
-

34:02.249 --> 34:04.626
-

34:04.793 --> 34:05.794
What?

34:07.838 --> 34:11.884
That is so weird,
but also kinda cool.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.552
Hey.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.637
-Hey, buddy.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.015
-Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

34:18.182 --> 34:19.433
I'm friendly, see?

34:20.350 --> 34:22.352
-I'm a friend.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.021
See? We're all friends.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.779
-ETHAN: Aah!

34:32.321 --> 34:33.363
Ow!

34:33.989 --> 34:35.491
-Okay.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.160
Yeah, I guess I deserved that.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.703
I did splat you into a wall.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.668
-Hey, that's my dad's.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.961
Where'd you get that?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.757
What? Can you bring me to him?

34:54.676 --> 34:56.011
I'm so lucky I ran into you.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.888
By the way,
you're not dangerous, right?

34:58.055 --> 35:00.599
I mean, you don't look dangerous,
I just, you know...

35:06.980 --> 35:08.732
Quickest route
to your flying machine

35:08.816 --> 35:10.776
is through that valley up ahead.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.194
Okay, I have so many questions.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.862
-Like, for one...

35:14.071 --> 35:15.447
what is this place?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.199
JAEGER: A subterranean labyrinth

35:17.366 --> 35:19.535
where everything's alive.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.912
And most things, well,
they want to eat ya.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.081
Uh, you mean like this thing?

35:24.706 --> 35:26.458
JAEGER: Nah, that's harmless.

35:27.334 --> 35:28.544
And... And these things?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.087
Funny little goobers, aren't they?

35:30.337 --> 35:33.423
-Every time I blaze a trail,

35:33.590 --> 35:35.008
they un-blaze it.

35:37.261 --> 35:38.720
-SEARCHER: Right.
-

35:38.804 --> 35:41.473
Um, so, how did you
even end up down here?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.768
Through ingenuity and sheer tenacity.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.980
After months of battling the elements,

35:48.146 --> 35:51.859
I figured there was no way
anyone could ever survive

35:52.025 --> 35:54.069
walking over those cold,
deadly peaks.

35:55.237 --> 35:58.907
So, I went searching for a new path.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.535
-The ground gave out.
-

36:01.994 --> 36:04.162
-And I found this place.
-

36:04.246 --> 36:05.247
SEARCHER: Oh,
so you're stuck down here.

36:06.248 --> 36:08.000
I, um... I...

36:08.083 --> 36:10.377
I wouldn't put it that way.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.005
So, I found this place.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.548
-And it occurred to me,

36:14.631 --> 36:16.758
instead of going over these mountains,

36:17.259 --> 36:19.428
I'll go under them.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.432
Even if I had to fight
every monster down here.

36:23.599 --> 36:25.809
Nothing was gonna stop Jaeger Clade

36:25.976 --> 36:28.228
from fulfilling his destiny.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.523
That is, until I came upon

36:31.690 --> 36:34.026
the Burning Sea.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.987
A place where the cliffs are alive

36:37.154 --> 36:40.324
and the waters will dissolve
the flesh off your bones.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.578
But now, with that
flying machine of yours,

36:44.661 --> 36:46.663
we got a way to fly right past it

36:46.747 --> 36:49.166
and onto the other side
of the mountains.

36:49.249 --> 36:53.462
Wait. You literally discovered
a world beneath our world,

36:53.629 --> 36:54.755
and that's not enough?

36:54.838 --> 36:58.967
This discovery may be fine
for some second-class explorers,

36:59.051 --> 37:00.928
but not for us Clades.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.221
Whoa, there.
This Clade is not an explorer.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.765
This Clade is a farmer.

37:04.932 --> 37:07.476
A farmer? Ugh!

37:07.559 --> 37:10.687
Your mom has a lot
of explaining to do.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.105
She's gone, Dad.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.901
Penelope's dead?

37:16.151 --> 37:17.903
Dead? No, she's not dead.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.863
She's 60 and works out
five days a week.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.281
I said she was gone.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.326
As in, moved on with Sheldon.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.954
Twenty-five years, Dad.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.665
We thought you were dead
for 25 years.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.626
What did you think
was gonna happen?

37:36.338 --> 37:37.673
-No! What? Aah!

37:37.756 --> 37:39.841
I am going to kill Sheldon!

37:39.925 --> 37:41.551
-What?
-I've always hated him.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.220
-You've never met him.
-I hate his name.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.639
And I'll probably hate
his face.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.349
Yep, he's takin' this really well.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.143
Uh, we should go.

37:50.227 --> 37:51.228
-

38:00.237 --> 38:01.822
-

38:30.517 --> 38:32.936
This place is so crazy.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.397
Who knew that
this was all down here?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.190
I mean, you knew
this was down here

38:37.274 --> 38:38.734
because you're from here,

38:38.900 --> 38:40.360
but it's not like this up top.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.030
Like, these colors,
these colors are so trippy.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.948
And these trees, ugh!

38:45.032 --> 38:47.284
Even the trees are cool.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.744
Why is it doing that, Splat?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.370
Oh, by the way,

38:50.829 --> 38:52.581
do you mind if I call you Splat?

38:52.664 --> 38:53.665
I just came up with it.

38:53.749 --> 38:55.083
You just kinda give me Splat vibes,

38:55.167 --> 38:56.626
-so I just thought...
-

38:56.710 --> 38:57.919
Oh.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.921
Wait, are you offended? I can't tell.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.174
You know what? I'll just follow you.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.747
Searcher, you call that climbing?

39:33.830 --> 39:35.248
I'm a 40-year-old man that farms.

39:35.332 --> 39:37.292
Climbing isn't really
part of my day-to-day.

39:37.459 --> 39:39.211
So, you just forgot

39:39.669 --> 39:41.171
everything I taught you?

39:41.379 --> 39:44.674
No, just the pointless explorer stuff.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.134
So, yeah, everything.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.970
JAEGER: Well, scoff all you want.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.847
But, when I get past these mountains,

39:51.014 --> 39:53.433
I'll return to Avalonia a hero.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.978
Bet they even give me a statue
in the town square.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.480
You already have a statue.

39:58.730 --> 39:59.731
I do?

39:59.815 --> 40:01.525
Yeah, and it's right beside mine.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.197
You have a statue?

40:07.364 --> 40:08.865
What, do they just give statues

40:08.949 --> 40:10.283
to everybody these days?

40:10.367 --> 40:11.993
No, Dad. I discovered Pando.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.329
You know, the thing
I'm actually down here to save.

40:14.496 --> 40:15.997
The discovery that actually
changed the world

40:16.164 --> 40:19.292
and transformed Avalonia
into the utopia that it is today.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.545
And not that it matters,
but my statue's taller.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.296
-Oh, here you go, little guy.

40:24.464 --> 40:28.552
Oh, well, so much for the
whole humble farmer bit, huh?

40:28.760 --> 40:31.596
Maybe you're more like me
than you want to admit.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.891
I am nothing like you.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.310
Uh-huh. Just keep
tellin' yourself that.

40:37.811 --> 40:38.854
Whatever.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.648
I created a real legacy when...

40:41.731 --> 40:42.732
-Whoa, whoa!
-

40:42.816 --> 40:44.776
Hey, there.
Uh, is this thing dangerous?

40:44.860 --> 40:46.778
-Maybe.
-

40:46.862 --> 40:48.155
SEARCHER: Oh, no, no, no.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.531
-

40:55.078 --> 40:56.371
Hold it.

40:58.915 --> 40:59.958
Hmm.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.128
There's someone else out here.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.505
That's Ethan's.
That's Ethan's.

41:05.589 --> 41:06.590
What?

41:07.174 --> 41:10.302
I said, that's Ethan's.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.845
-Who's Ethan?
-My son.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.180
Your son?

41:13.346 --> 41:16.141
Jaeger Clade is a grandpa?

41:16.224 --> 41:18.518
Ugh. I guess, technically, yes.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.020
JAEGER: Hmm.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.272
Well, he's not alone.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.065
-

41:24.149 --> 41:26.735
-SEARCHER: He's with a what?
-A scout for the Reapers.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.195
They only got one job,

41:28.361 --> 41:29.738
to lure you to your death.

41:29.905 --> 41:31.865
What? Can this thing move faster?

41:31.948 --> 41:33.617
-Hyah!
-

41:38.830 --> 41:39.956
Whoa.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.291
What is this thing?

41:42.125 --> 41:44.461
Hey, we're still looking
for my dad, right?

41:50.884 --> 41:52.886
-

41:54.804 --> 41:56.848
-

42:10.403 --> 42:12.364
-Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

42:12.447 --> 42:13.782
But this Pando fell off the Venture

42:13.865 --> 42:15.533
and we don't waste pods, so...

42:15.700 --> 42:17.160
I'm just gonna grab it
really quick, okay?

42:17.244 --> 42:18.328
-Hang on, hang on.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.788
Really quick. Just let me
grab the rest of these.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.374
-

42:22.457 --> 42:23.458
Splat?

42:24.125 --> 42:25.126
Splat!

42:31.967 --> 42:33.134
Here, it's okay.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.719
I can help you with that.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.304
Let me see.

42:38.098 --> 42:39.432
You can trust me.

42:49.859 --> 42:51.486
- Here, here.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.071
It's okay, it's okay.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.121
And there you go.

43:02.372 --> 43:04.457
-Good as new.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.420
-

43:09.087 --> 43:10.630
Are these friends of yours?

43:10.714 --> 43:13.258
-Uh, hi, I'm Ethan.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.177
I thought Splat here
was bringing me to my dad.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.555
Uh, maybe I was wrong.

43:18.638 --> 43:20.015
-Don't see my dad anywhere.

43:21.725 --> 43:23.310
I'll just be on my way. Whoa!

43:23.393 --> 43:24.602
-Uh...
-

43:28.898 --> 43:31.318
-

43:35.822 --> 43:36.823
Whoa.

43:36.906 --> 43:38.116
-Oh, Ethan!
-Dad.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.326
Stay behind me.

43:39.409 --> 43:41.369
-Who's he?
-Ethan, meet your grandpa.

43:41.536 --> 43:42.620
That's Jaeger Clade?

43:42.787 --> 43:44.080
The one and only.

43:44.914 --> 43:46.916
-Follow me.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.964
ETHAN: Ahh!
SEARCHER: Whoa!

43:53.673 --> 43:54.674
Now what?

43:54.758 --> 43:56.760
-Jump!
-

44:02.265 --> 44:03.683
ETHAN: Whoa!

44:03.767 --> 44:04.851
What are these things?

44:04.934 --> 44:06.102
Our ticket out of here.

44:10.065 --> 44:11.358
SEARCHER: They're not
gonna eat us, right?

44:11.441 --> 44:13.234
-No, but they will.
-What?

44:13.318 --> 44:14.736
-Just run.
- Whoa!

44:23.453 --> 44:24.954
-ETHAN: Dad!

44:28.416 --> 44:30.835
Come on, Searcher.
Stop embarrassing me out here.

44:32.379 --> 44:33.463
He's awesome.

44:33.546 --> 44:34.714
He is not awesome.

44:34.798 --> 44:35.924
He just saved my life.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.717
You know, I was a part
of that rescue too.

44:37.884 --> 44:39.094
He just saved your life.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.679
You ain't seen
nothing yet, kid.

44:41.930 --> 44:43.348
-

44:47.310 --> 44:49.354
-No, Ethan.

44:51.147 --> 44:52.357
ETHAN: Splat.

44:55.443 --> 44:56.736
Whoa!

44:56.820 --> 44:57.821
Thanks, buddy.

44:57.904 --> 44:59.531
-Are you okay?
-

44:59.614 --> 45:00.907
I'm talkin' to my son.

45:00.990 --> 45:02.242
-I'm fine, Dad.
-JAEGER: Whoo!

45:02.325 --> 45:03.493
Can you not show off

45:03.576 --> 45:05.745
while we are running for our lives?

45:05.829 --> 45:07.414
Ha, calm down. The kid's all right.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.000
How are you my dad?

45:11.084 --> 45:12.585
Oh, you want to have
that conversation?

45:12.669 --> 45:14.254
Well, when two people
love each other...

45:14.337 --> 45:15.755
SEARCHER: Don't!
Stop talking, stop talking.

45:15.839 --> 45:17.549
Stop talking,
stop talking, stop talking.

45:26.141 --> 45:28.059
Time for a barbeque.

45:30.103 --> 45:31.813
-That ain't good.
-

45:33.690 --> 45:34.691
MERIDIAN: Heads up.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.568
Get on.

45:36.651 --> 45:37.777
-Meridian.
-Mom.

45:37.861 --> 45:39.571
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't you "Mom" me.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.990
Once we get home,
your butt is grounded for life.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.283
-Ooh, I like her.
-Who's he?

45:43.366 --> 45:44.534
-My dad.
-What?

45:44.617 --> 45:46.119
Hurry up. Go, go, go.

45:59.007 --> 46:00.425
A wall of monsters.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.177
Wall of monsters.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.220
Don't worry. I got this.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.605
Okay. So, they're smarter
than they look.

46:13.771 --> 46:14.856
I could've told you that.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.274
Wait. Jaeger Clade?

46:16.357 --> 46:18.026
-The one and...
-We know.

46:18.109 --> 46:19.861
Uh, guys. We're stuck.

46:21.696 --> 46:23.823
-Great idea, Splat.

46:23.990 --> 46:25.575
Splat? Its name is Splat?

46:30.455 --> 46:31.915
MERIDIAN: Callisto,
give us a push.

46:34.959 --> 46:36.252
Hang on, everybody.

46:46.346 --> 46:48.431
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe,
little Ethan.

46:48.515 --> 46:50.391
-You had me so worried.
-Uh, okay.

46:50.475 --> 46:51.601
-Sorry.
-

46:51.684 --> 46:54.229
Oh-ho! What is that?
It's so cute.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.522
I wanna merchandise it.

46:55.605 --> 46:56.898
-Ow!

46:56.981 --> 46:58.358
JAEGER: This'll do just fine.

46:58.525 --> 47:01.027
Other side of the mountains,
here I come.

47:01.110 --> 47:02.695
Okay, that's not
what we're here to do.

47:02.779 --> 47:04.739
Ooh, right. Your silly little plant.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.157
It is not silly.

47:06.241 --> 47:08.201
Fine. Your boring little plant.

47:08.284 --> 47:09.619
SEARCHER: You know what I find boring?

47:09.702 --> 47:10.703
JAEGER: Your terrible comeback.

47:10.787 --> 47:12.330
SEARCHER: What? No. Ugh!

47:12.413 --> 47:13.915
-You.
-JAEGER: Oh, clever.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.251
Okay. Adult speaking here.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.669
Searcher's right.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.046
The mission is to get
to Pando's heart.

47:20.338 --> 47:21.548
-SEARCHER: Hmm.
-

47:21.631 --> 47:23.591
'Cause as we can all see,

47:23.800 --> 47:25.468
we are on a clock.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.472
But after we do that,

47:29.639 --> 47:31.349
there's nothing stopping us

47:31.516 --> 47:34.310
from continuing on
to the other side of the mountains.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.229
-Sound like a fair deal?
-

47:36.312 --> 47:38.773
-Okay. Then it's all settled.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.568
Come on, Ethan. Let's go get
a sample from that Pando root.

47:41.651 --> 47:43.611
Meridian, care to do the honors?

47:49.742 --> 47:51.911
All right, Venture.
I guess this makes us official.

47:52.203 --> 47:54.497
Just don't make me look bad
in front of my family.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.640
-

48:15.476 --> 48:16.686
-Whoa.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.991
CASPIAN: Hey, look.
It's Jaeger Classic.

48:32.201 --> 48:33.661
CREW MEMBER: So nice
to meet you, Mr. Clade.

48:33.745 --> 48:35.038
JAEGER: Nice to meet you.

48:57.143 --> 48:58.936
-

49:00.438 --> 49:01.439
-

49:02.940 --> 49:04.484
-

49:26.506 --> 49:27.590
Wow.

49:40.770 --> 49:42.897
-Awesome.
-

49:45.358 --> 49:46.818
-

49:48.277 --> 49:50.863
JAEGER: Hey, get out of here.
Come on, get, get, get.

49:50.947 --> 49:52.031
Hah. Shoo.

49:52.115 --> 49:53.116
Okay.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.326
Seemed pretty harmless to me.

49:55.410 --> 49:57.370
Eh, better safe than sorry.

49:58.037 --> 49:59.580
So, you're my grandson, huh?

49:59.747 --> 50:01.499
Yep, that's the rumor.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.418
Well, tell me about yourself, Ethan.

50:03.584 --> 50:04.585
What are you into?

50:04.752 --> 50:06.087
Fighting, hunting?

50:06.379 --> 50:09.590
Any sweethearts waiting
for you back home, huh?

50:09.674 --> 50:11.050
Ah...

50:11.134 --> 50:12.135
-There it is.
-

50:13.594 --> 50:14.637
Who is it?

50:14.721 --> 50:16.389
Uh, it's no one. Uh...

50:16.472 --> 50:18.307
Diazo. His name is Diazo.

50:18.474 --> 50:19.559
Diazo, huh?

50:19.726 --> 50:20.727
I really like him a lot.

50:20.810 --> 50:22.395
I just don't know how to tell him

50:22.478 --> 50:24.355
because I just get this.

50:24.439 --> 50:25.440
I always get so this.

50:25.523 --> 50:29.318
Hey, let your grandpa
give you some solid advice.

50:29.485 --> 50:32.155
If you really, really want
to impress this fella,

50:32.321 --> 50:33.614
-this is what you do.
-

50:33.781 --> 50:36.200
You get him into a dangerous situation,

50:36.367 --> 50:39.245
like maybe one
in which he almost dies.

50:39.328 --> 50:40.413
-

50:41.581 --> 50:42.874
And then you save him from it.

50:42.957 --> 50:44.125
-Ahh!

50:44.208 --> 50:46.919
Bonus points if it includes
bandits, alligators,

50:47.003 --> 50:48.921
and/or spectacular explosions.

50:54.677 --> 50:57.180
Hmm, yeah. All that sounds
like a really toxic way

50:57.263 --> 50:58.389
to start a relationship.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.266
Not to mention, crazy dangerous.

51:00.349 --> 51:01.350
-JAEGER: Dangerous?

51:01.768 --> 51:03.603
Ha! You're a Clade.

51:03.770 --> 51:04.812
We love danger.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.190
Go ahead, give it a try.

51:08.524 --> 51:10.276
Uh, really? Okay.

51:10.443 --> 51:12.069
-

51:12.445 --> 51:15.865
Oh, yeah. That's a Clade boy
right there.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.535
-Pando schmando.
-

51:20.369 --> 51:21.370
Hey, Dad.

51:21.454 --> 51:23.206
Um, I really appreciate you
bonding with Ethan here.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.541
But maybe a flamethrower
isn't his thing.

51:27.335 --> 51:30.379
I appreciate that you think that.

51:30.546 --> 51:34.133
But maybe Ethan
doesn't know his thing

51:34.300 --> 51:35.927
unless he tries.

51:36.511 --> 51:37.553
So, go ahead, kiddo.

51:37.637 --> 51:39.722
Well,
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

51:39.806 --> 51:41.307
but Ethan already has a thing.

51:41.474 --> 51:42.934
And it's called
a Pando Picker,

51:43.017 --> 51:44.101
and he's really good with it.

51:44.685 --> 51:48.147
I appreciate your appreciation,
but maybe...

51:48.231 --> 51:50.441
-Uh...
-...we let the kid decide.

51:50.525 --> 51:52.819
Ah, well, I appreciate
your appreciation,

51:52.902 --> 51:54.946
but maybe you'll appreciate me
a little bit more

51:55.029 --> 51:56.030
and respect my wishes, please.

51:57.198 --> 51:59.033
And maybe you should
step out of my air.

51:59.200 --> 52:02.662
Or maybe we lower
the temperature a little bit.

52:02.829 --> 52:04.330
Okay.

52:04.497 --> 52:05.957
What do you have in mind?

52:06.123 --> 52:08.000
A little Primal Outpost.

52:08.167 --> 52:10.795
Ethan, the fate of Pando
is in our hands.

52:10.962 --> 52:12.964
I don't think we have
the luxury of playing games.

52:13.047 --> 52:16.425
Oh, we got a little time
before we hit the Burning Sea.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.344
You go babysit your plant.

52:18.511 --> 52:22.431
My grandson and I
are going to play some cards.

52:22.515 --> 52:23.933
Deal me in.

52:24.267 --> 52:25.977
Can someone trade me a weapon?

52:26.143 --> 52:28.271
All I got is dirt and gardening tools.

52:28.437 --> 52:29.522
I have masonry stones.

52:29.939 --> 52:31.774
Chucking stones could be effective.

52:31.858 --> 52:34.652
Yeah, so that's not
what masonry stones are for.

52:34.819 --> 52:37.154
He's right. I need crossbows.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.948
You got any crossbows?

52:39.365 --> 52:41.492
-Argh!
-

52:41.576 --> 52:43.119
Hey, Splat just stole my cards.

52:43.202 --> 52:44.996
-You get anything good? Hey!

52:45.079 --> 52:48.040
Okay, and time's up.

52:48.207 --> 52:49.292
Trading period has ended.

52:49.375 --> 52:50.585
A-ha! A crossbow.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.420
I knew you were holding out on me.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.047
-Ow.
-

52:56.632 --> 52:58.801
Okay, event card time.

52:59.218 --> 53:01.554
Are you ready to deal with

53:01.721 --> 53:03.180
a demon spider?

53:03.264 --> 53:04.265
JAEGER: Kill it.

53:04.348 --> 53:07.268
Uh, the point is not to kill it.

53:07.435 --> 53:09.270
I know demon spider sounds scary.

53:09.437 --> 53:11.272
Oh, yeah. That thing will
devour our crops for sure.

53:11.439 --> 53:12.732
That's what you're worried about?

53:13.149 --> 53:15.568
The objective of Primal Outpost

53:15.735 --> 53:17.945
is to live harmoniously
with your environment.

53:18.029 --> 53:19.196
I throw masonry stones at it.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.240
JAEGER: And I shoot it
with my brand-new crossbow.

53:21.324 --> 53:24.035
Hmm. Okay, fine. It's dead.
See, you killed it.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.912
That's what I'm talkin' about.

53:27.163 --> 53:28.164
Over. Uh...

53:28.623 --> 53:29.832
Over the... No, around the...

53:29.916 --> 53:31.834
SEARCHER: Open...

53:31.918 --> 53:33.794
-Oh, but wait.
-OTHERS: Hmm?

53:33.878 --> 53:36.172
The demon spider was the only thing

53:36.255 --> 53:37.632
keeping the murder locusts

53:37.798 --> 53:40.009
from destroying all your resources.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.970
-Congrats, you're dead.
-

53:43.054 --> 53:45.139
I agree with that snot bubble here. What?

53:45.222 --> 53:46.974
Wait. The demon spider
wasn't the bad guy?

53:47.141 --> 53:49.435
For the 27th time, there are no bad guys.

53:49.602 --> 53:53.230
The objective isn't to kill
or destroy monsters.

53:53.397 --> 53:56.692
You're just supposed to build
a working civilization

53:56.859 --> 53:58.694
utilizing the environment around you.

53:59.445 --> 54:00.613
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

54:00.696 --> 54:01.822
-SEARCHER: Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.240
Yeah. I don't get this game.

54:03.324 --> 54:04.909
Me neither.
-

54:04.992 --> 54:06.661
Oh, come...
It is not that complicated.

54:06.827 --> 54:07.912
Maybe I'll just farm Pando.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.038
Pando's not a part of the game.

54:09.121 --> 54:11.040
Can we conquer the monsters
and use them as weapons?

54:11.207 --> 54:12.625
Monsters aren't weapons.

54:12.792 --> 54:13.793
SPLAT: Ta-da!

54:13.876 --> 54:14.877
What? No.

54:15.044 --> 54:17.129
-Check out my new weapon.
-

54:17.213 --> 54:18.464
If he gets a monster, I get Pando.

54:18.547 --> 54:20.591
-No monster, no Pando.
-And no bad guys?

54:20.675 --> 54:22.385
What kind of game has no bad guys?

54:22.551 --> 54:23.886
JAEGER: That's just poor storytelling.

54:24.178 --> 54:25.179
Okay. You know what?

54:25.554 --> 54:26.555
You want bad guys?

54:26.722 --> 54:28.599
Fine. You two are the bad guys.

54:28.766 --> 54:31.727
Because you both
are annoying me. Argh!

54:35.731 --> 54:36.857
-

54:36.941 --> 54:39.485
Ha. Teenagers, right?

54:40.528 --> 54:42.571
-I win.
-

54:51.831 --> 54:53.457
JAEGER: The Burning Sea.

54:53.624 --> 54:57.086
It's the one obstacle that
stands between Jaeger Clade

54:57.503 --> 54:59.088
and his destiny.

54:59.171 --> 55:01.215
Can you go be dramatic
somewhere else?

55:01.382 --> 55:02.508
What do you see?

55:02.591 --> 55:03.843
SEARCHER: Looks like
the roots continue

55:03.926 --> 55:05.678
across the ceiling to the other side.

55:05.845 --> 55:08.180
Well, if we're gonna find
the heart of Pando,

55:08.347 --> 55:09.557
we got to get through this.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.641
Hold up.

55:10.725 --> 55:12.101
You all have eyeballs, right?

55:12.268 --> 55:13.936
We're all seeing
the same thing, yeah?

55:14.103 --> 55:15.229
That's acid.

55:15.396 --> 55:16.605
No one can fly through that.

55:31.787 --> 55:33.831
Um, what's happening here?

55:42.840 --> 55:45.259
This is gonna be awesome.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.685
Uh, are we...
Are we doing this?

55:57.021 --> 55:58.689
Oh, we're doing this. Okay.

56:02.902 --> 56:04.111
-

56:11.577 --> 56:12.912
-

56:43.359 --> 56:44.777
-

56:56.288 --> 56:57.623
-

56:58.791 --> 57:01.502
-That was so Primal Outpost.

57:02.336 --> 57:04.505
Whew! So glad we're not dead.

57:14.098 --> 57:15.516
CALLISTO: Get off my ship.

57:25.526 --> 57:26.777
-JAEGER: No.

57:33.868 --> 57:35.828
-CALLISTO: Ugh.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.830
You don't happen to have
another one of these, do you?

57:37.997 --> 57:39.999
It's okay. I got a better weapon.

57:45.462 --> 57:46.964
Aim at center mass.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.925
-Whew.

57:51.302 --> 57:53.137
-

57:53.637 --> 57:55.306
-Wow.
-Who taught you how to throw?

57:55.472 --> 57:56.932
-Sheldon.
-

57:57.016 --> 57:59.560
-Keep us covered.
-On it.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.645
All right. This is how you throw.

58:01.812 --> 58:02.813
Center your weight,

58:02.897 --> 58:05.399
breathe in, focus

58:05.608 --> 58:07.193
and follow through.

58:07.276 --> 58:08.611
-You see,

58:08.694 --> 58:10.321
it's all in the follow through.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.739
All right, your turn.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.867
Okay. Center weight,

58:14.950 --> 58:16.368
breathe, focus

58:16.452 --> 58:18.245
and follow through.

58:18.495 --> 58:20.247
-There you go. Ha.

58:20.581 --> 58:22.041
Now, take 'em out
on the right.

58:22.750 --> 58:24.919
-Attaboy. Light 'em up.
-

58:27.296 --> 58:29.131
-JAEGER: Oh, yeah!
-Serve it up.

58:30.090 --> 58:31.091
Come on, Pops.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.136
-Yeah!

58:34.220 --> 58:37.056
JAEGER: Ah-ha!
You ain't nothin' against the Clades.

58:47.358 --> 58:49.360
Not too bad for a farmer, right?

58:49.902 --> 58:51.987
Yeah, not too bad at all.

59:07.836 --> 59:10.047
Okay, I gotta ask,

59:11.507 --> 59:12.967
why farming?

59:14.218 --> 59:17.304
Well, I... I love being outside.

59:17.471 --> 59:21.433
And being my own boss.

59:21.684 --> 59:23.727
Right. I get that.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.313
And I like that I can
pour my heart and soul

59:26.397 --> 59:28.065
into what I'm growing.

59:28.232 --> 59:31.777
You know, make sure it becomes
exactly what I need it to be,

59:33.153 --> 59:35.072
something strong that lasts.

59:36.282 --> 59:38.575
And a legacy
that my son can be proud of.

59:39.743 --> 59:40.786
JAEGER: Hmm.

59:41.453 --> 59:42.788
I get that too.

59:58.846 --> 1:00:02.808
You want to know why I didn't
try harder to come home?

1:00:06.020 --> 1:00:07.938
Well, the thought did cross my mind.

1:00:09.481 --> 1:00:10.566
It's...

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:13.652
It's because I'm stuck.

1:00:13.944 --> 1:00:15.612
Well, yeah. I know.

1:00:15.696 --> 1:00:18.449
Yeah. Different kind of stuck.

1:00:18.824 --> 1:00:22.328
You see, I've been an explorer
my whole life.

1:00:23.454 --> 1:00:27.624
Chasing that horizon,
that's all I've ever known.

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:31.086
Even though it cost me everything.

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:33.756
You,

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:36.091
your mom,

1:00:37.051 --> 1:00:40.054
the last 25 years of my life.

1:00:41.305 --> 1:00:42.890
If I gave up on it,

1:00:43.891 --> 1:00:45.184
what would I be?

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.062
Who would I be?

1:00:57.363 --> 1:00:59.615
too old to change now.

1:01:02.409 --> 1:01:04.161
Right.

1:01:04.244 --> 1:01:07.539
Let's go get another drink
while we still can.

1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:23.180
-Oh, hi, you.

1:01:23.263 --> 1:01:24.681
-Hey, don't touch that.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:26.934
Stop it.

1:01:27.017 --> 1:01:28.227
Stop touching those things.

1:01:28.310 --> 1:01:29.520
-Hey. Hey. Don't.
-

1:01:29.603 --> 1:01:32.523
Hey, stop pushing buttons.
Bad Splat.

1:01:37.069 --> 1:01:39.446
You tried.

1:01:42.282 --> 1:01:44.201
ETHAN: Huh. Look at that.

1:01:44.368 --> 1:01:45.702
They're finally gettin' along.

1:01:45.786 --> 1:01:47.329
About time, right?

1:01:47.413 --> 1:01:48.414
Yeah.

1:01:48.497 --> 1:01:51.375
Especially since they're
basically the same person.

1:01:51.458 --> 1:01:53.377
Mm, don't let your father
hear you say that.

1:01:57.631 --> 1:01:59.425
Hey, you wanna take the wheel?

1:01:59.591 --> 1:02:01.093
I'm dyin' for a cup of coffee.

1:02:01.260 --> 1:02:02.302
-Wait. Really?
-Yeah.

1:02:02.469 --> 1:02:03.637
Just follow the roots.

1:02:03.804 --> 1:02:05.597
-

1:02:13.397 --> 1:02:15.566
Whoa.
-

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:20.404
Hmm. If only Diazo could see you now.

1:02:20.487 --> 1:02:21.488
-Huh?
-What?

1:02:21.572 --> 1:02:23.198
You don't think your dad and I talk?

1:02:25.701 --> 1:02:26.743
You're doing great.

1:02:26.910 --> 1:02:29.371
Yeah, just watch out
for the walking landmass!

1:02:31.498 --> 1:02:33.417
ETHAN: And I got it. See?

1:02:38.255 --> 1:02:39.548
Sorry, sorry.

1:02:39.631 --> 1:02:41.383
Uh, my bad. We're all good.

1:02:41.467 --> 1:02:43.886
-

1:02:43.969 --> 1:02:45.179
Whew.

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:47.139
Why is this place so weird?

1:02:47.681 --> 1:02:49.183
Uh, I don't know.

1:02:49.558 --> 1:02:51.018
I think this place is...

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:52.853
it's kind of amazing.

1:02:55.981 --> 1:02:58.650
You know, I...
I gotta say, Ethan.

1:02:59.526 --> 1:03:01.862
I've never seen you so happy
as you are down here.

1:03:01.945 --> 1:03:04.990
I guess, just...

1:03:05.157 --> 1:03:06.992
The farm is so small.

1:03:07.493 --> 1:03:09.495
The world is so big.

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:11.497
I just feel

1:03:11.997 --> 1:03:14.041
like I'm in my element.
I don't know.

1:03:18.045 --> 1:03:19.922
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

1:03:20.005 --> 1:03:21.006
I can look at you.

1:03:21.089 --> 1:03:22.174
Mom, please don't make it weird.

1:03:22.257 --> 1:03:23.592
Moms can't be weird.

1:03:23.759 --> 1:03:25.052
-We gave birth to you.
-

1:03:25.135 --> 1:03:26.220
We've got rights.

1:03:26.386 --> 1:03:27.804
And I'd like to exercise my right

1:03:27.888 --> 1:03:29.097
to stare at you uncomfortably.

1:03:29.181 --> 1:03:30.974
No, you have to focus
on the road.

1:03:31.058 --> 1:03:32.643
You have to look at the road.
You're driving.

1:03:32.809 --> 1:03:33.977
Oh, calm down.

1:03:34.561 --> 1:03:37.689
I'm just saying, you should
keep exploring those feelings.

1:03:38.649 --> 1:03:40.943
Might just lead you down
some interesting paths.

1:03:49.910 --> 1:03:52.663
-

1:04:10.556 --> 1:04:12.724
I've been down here for 25 years

1:04:12.891 --> 1:04:15.185
and I've never seen anything like this.

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:17.354
SEARCHER: This doesn't
make any sense.

1:04:18.105 --> 1:04:20.857
Pando seems to be getting
stronger the deeper we go.

1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:24.278
If Pando is dying,
shouldn't it be getting weaker?

1:04:24.361 --> 1:04:26.113
President Mal, the Reapers are here,

1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:27.698
and they brought friends.

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:29.032
-What?
-

1:04:29.116 --> 1:04:30.659
Meridian, go!

1:04:33.787 --> 1:04:35.998
-

1:04:45.757 --> 1:04:46.758
I can't outrun 'em.

1:04:57.019 --> 1:04:58.312
They didn't attack us.

1:05:00.147 --> 1:05:01.607
But why didn't they attack us?

1:05:01.773 --> 1:05:05.235
It might have something
to do with that.

1:05:10.282 --> 1:05:12.534
I think we found the heart of Pando.

1:05:23.462 --> 1:05:24.463
What are they doing?

1:05:24.546 --> 1:05:25.839
Well, they're doing
what any pest would do.

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:27.507
They're trying to dig
into Pando's heart

1:05:27.591 --> 1:05:29.176
and devour it from the inside.

1:05:29.343 --> 1:05:31.303
It's fighting for its life out there.

1:05:31.470 --> 1:05:33.805
That's why our plants
are dying up top.

1:05:33.972 --> 1:05:35.641
Pando's rerouting all its energy

1:05:35.724 --> 1:05:37.392
to protect itself right here.

1:05:37.601 --> 1:05:38.852
Our plant's not sick,

1:05:39.353 --> 1:05:40.562
it's at war.

1:05:40.729 --> 1:05:42.773
Well, let's even the odds.

1:05:42.856 --> 1:05:44.441
Easier said than done.

1:05:44.608 --> 1:05:45.651
We have Pando.

1:05:45.734 --> 1:05:47.402
Do you know how much Pando
that would take?

1:05:47.486 --> 1:05:48.528
You got a better idea?

1:05:48.612 --> 1:05:50.572
Yeah. We abandon this lost cause

1:05:50.739 --> 1:05:52.282
and fly to the other side
of the mountains.

1:05:52.366 --> 1:05:53.867
How does that save Pando exactly?

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:56.286
JAEGER: It doesn't.
But I've lived my whole life

1:05:56.370 --> 1:05:58.038
without the stuff. You'll be fine.

1:05:58.205 --> 1:05:59.456
CALLISTO:
We're not dropping Pando

1:05:59.539 --> 1:06:01.625
just so you can plant your flag.

1:06:01.708 --> 1:06:04.169
Avalonia is depending on us to save it.

1:06:04.336 --> 1:06:05.504
And that's what we're gonna do.

1:06:05.587 --> 1:06:06.797
SEARCHER:
I couldn't agree more.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:08.507
Dad, what are you doing?

1:06:11.218 --> 1:06:13.428
-

1:06:15.055 --> 1:06:17.140
Just like how we do it on our farm.

1:06:17.307 --> 1:06:19.351
Now that's a Clade boy!

1:06:19.434 --> 1:06:21.895
Listen up, bring up every
crate of Pando from the hull.

1:06:22.062 --> 1:06:23.271
Looks like we're turning the Venture

1:06:23.355 --> 1:06:25.399
into the world's biggest crop duster.

1:06:44.251 --> 1:06:46.503
-

1:06:48.004 --> 1:06:49.047
-Huh?

1:06:49.131 --> 1:06:50.215
What is it, Splat?

1:06:51.633 --> 1:06:52.634
What?

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.011
What?

1:06:55.095 --> 1:06:56.763
Oh.
-

1:06:58.724 --> 1:07:00.392
What does that mean?
I don't understand.

1:07:00.475 --> 1:07:02.477
Ethan, come here for a sec.

1:07:02.936 --> 1:07:04.521
I'm sorry, Splat.
I gotta go.

1:07:06.398 --> 1:07:07.399
Yeah, Dad?

1:07:07.482 --> 1:07:09.401
We came down here to save our farm

1:07:09.484 --> 1:07:11.361
and that's what
we're gonna do, together.

1:07:12.195 --> 1:07:13.280
You know what?

1:07:13.363 --> 1:07:16.116
Um, I'm good.
I wouldn't even know what to do.

1:07:16.199 --> 1:07:17.784
It's simple, you just point and spray.

1:07:17.951 --> 1:07:19.661
This is more your thing, Dad.

1:07:19.828 --> 1:07:22.164
This is our thing, Ethan.
Father and son.

1:07:22.330 --> 1:07:24.624
It just doesn't feel right to me.

1:07:24.791 --> 1:07:26.668
I don't want to kill all these creatures.

1:07:27.169 --> 1:07:28.670
Well, don't think of it as killing.

1:07:28.837 --> 1:07:30.756
We're just exterminating some pests

1:07:30.839 --> 1:07:32.632
trying to destroy our crops.

1:07:35.218 --> 1:07:36.428
We're farmers, Ethan.

1:07:37.179 --> 1:07:38.346
This is what farmers do.

1:07:39.389 --> 1:07:41.308
Well, then, maybe I'm not a farmer.

1:07:41.683 --> 1:07:42.809
What?

1:07:43.185 --> 1:07:44.478
I'm not a farmer, Dad.

1:07:45.896 --> 1:07:48.398
Ethan, where is all this coming from?

1:07:48.482 --> 1:07:49.566
This doesn't sound like you.

1:07:49.649 --> 1:07:50.984
But it is me, Dad.

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:53.987
This is probably the most me
I've ever been. I just...

1:07:54.154 --> 1:07:57.115
I feel like I'm in my element
when I'm exploring this world.

1:07:57.324 --> 1:07:58.825
Exploring?

1:07:59.034 --> 1:08:00.911
Well, yeah. I mean, there's...

1:08:01.077 --> 1:08:03.288
there's just so much
to discover here and...

1:08:03.371 --> 1:08:05.290
Wait, wait, are you...
are you saying,

1:08:05.373 --> 1:08:06.958
you want to be an explorer?

1:08:07.042 --> 1:08:08.460
Hey, is everything all right?

1:08:08.543 --> 1:08:09.669
-Is this because of him?
-What?

1:08:09.753 --> 1:08:10.879
-It is, isn't it?
-No.

1:08:10.962 --> 1:08:13.173
-What did you say to Ethan?
-I didn't say anything.

1:08:13.340 --> 1:08:14.382
Dad, it's not Grandpa's fault.

1:08:14.549 --> 1:08:16.134
Are you trying to brainwash my son?

1:08:16.218 --> 1:08:17.844
-Brainwash?
-Ethan, will you trust me?

1:08:18.011 --> 1:08:19.888
You do not want to be like him.

1:08:20.055 --> 1:08:22.224
The only thing he cares about is himself

1:08:22.390 --> 1:08:24.351
and conquering those mountains.

1:08:24.518 --> 1:08:26.853
I know you, Ethan. And this isn't you.

1:08:29.272 --> 1:08:30.607
-Ethan, come back here.

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:33.443
Ethan. Ethan!

1:08:35.946 --> 1:08:36.947
Are you crazy?

1:08:37.364 --> 1:08:39.741
-Hey, get on this skiff now.
-Leave me alone.

1:08:45.163 --> 1:08:46.540
Hey, what is this all about?

1:08:46.623 --> 1:08:48.792
-You, Dad. You.
-Me?

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:50.669
You just assume
I'll follow in your footsteps,

1:08:50.752 --> 1:08:52.712
but you never asked me
what I wanted.

1:08:52.796 --> 1:08:53.922
You're a kid.

1:08:54.381 --> 1:08:55.590
You don't know what you want.

1:08:55.757 --> 1:08:58.051
I know I don't wanna be you.

1:09:24.786 --> 1:09:27.455
My whole life, I worked so hard

1:09:27.956 --> 1:09:29.958
to be the exact opposite of my dad.

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:34.838
And, uh, looks like
I ended up just like him.

1:09:39.718 --> 1:09:41.970
I just wanted so badly
to build you a legacy

1:09:42.053 --> 1:09:43.305
you could be proud of.

1:09:44.723 --> 1:09:48.393
But I mighta got
a little bit caught up in it.

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:50.061
Dad, stop talking.

1:09:50.145 --> 1:09:51.980
Ethan, I'm trying to apologize here.

1:09:52.063 --> 1:09:53.064
Dad.

1:09:59.988 --> 1:10:01.907
I think we're on the other side
of the mountains.

1:10:10.874 --> 1:10:14.169
There is nothing but water out there.

1:10:14.252 --> 1:10:15.503
-

1:10:42.822 --> 1:10:45.408
That's an eye, right?

1:10:45.909 --> 1:10:46.910
Yeah.

1:10:46.993 --> 1:10:50.538
A... A really, really big eye.

1:10:50.622 --> 1:10:51.623
Yeah.

1:10:52.582 --> 1:10:54.209
SEARCHER: And it's looking right at us.

1:10:54.626 --> 1:10:55.919
You...

1:10:56.002 --> 1:10:57.379
You know what this means, right?

1:10:57.462 --> 1:10:58.964
-It's judging me?
-No, no.

1:10:59.047 --> 1:11:00.924
If this place has an eye,

1:11:01.091 --> 1:11:02.676
it has to be attached to a head.

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:04.094
And if this place has a head,

1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:06.137
that means what we've been
travelling through

1:11:06.221 --> 1:11:08.139
this entire time was its insides.

1:11:08.223 --> 1:11:09.516
Like, its guts and stuff?

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:11.101
Okay, yes. Hear me out.

1:11:11.267 --> 1:11:12.852
The windy forests that we were in,

1:11:13.019 --> 1:11:14.270
that's the lungs.

1:11:14.354 --> 1:11:16.690
And... And the acid lake?
That's the stomach.

1:11:17.107 --> 1:11:20.610
And this giant eye must be its eye.

1:11:21.194 --> 1:11:22.404
The Reapers aren't monsters.

1:11:22.946 --> 1:11:24.906
-They're an immune system.
-What?

1:11:25.073 --> 1:11:27.075
That's what Splat was trying to tell me.

1:11:27.242 --> 1:11:29.035
This place is alive.

1:11:29.202 --> 1:11:30.328
It's a living thing.

1:11:30.412 --> 1:11:31.871
We didn't find the heart of Pando.

1:11:32.038 --> 1:11:33.915
We found an actual heart.

1:11:34.499 --> 1:11:37.502
So, all this time,

1:11:38.128 --> 1:11:40.296
we've been living on the back

1:11:40.714 --> 1:11:42.674
of this giant creature?

1:11:42.841 --> 1:11:45.677
Yeah. And Pando is killing it.

1:11:46.761 --> 1:11:49.305
-

1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:00.150
This creature's immune system
has no way to defend itself.

1:12:00.233 --> 1:12:01.317
We need to hurry.

1:12:05.822 --> 1:12:07.991
-

1:12:08.867 --> 1:12:09.868
What?

1:12:10.452 --> 1:12:11.995
Wha... I don't know
what you just said,

1:12:12.078 --> 1:12:13.663
but I'm pretty sure
it was inappropriate.

1:12:13.830 --> 1:12:15.206
Mom, you have to turn
the ship around.

1:12:15.290 --> 1:12:16.791
-I'm sorry, what?
-Mission's over.

1:12:16.958 --> 1:12:18.793
This place is not what it seems.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:20.670
-Is there a problem?
-Big problem.

1:12:20.754 --> 1:12:23.006
Listen, Ethan and I
got into a huge fight.

1:12:23.298 --> 1:12:24.299
So I jumped off the ship.

1:12:24.382 --> 1:12:25.467
You jumped off the ship?

1:12:25.550 --> 1:12:26.926
-But he's safe.
-Dad came after me.

1:12:27.010 --> 1:12:28.011
And the next thing we know,

1:12:28.094 --> 1:12:29.262
we're on the other side
of the mountains.

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:30.847
-What?
-Staring directly at

1:12:30.930 --> 1:12:32.724
-a giant creature!
-A giant creature!

1:12:32.807 --> 1:12:33.808
What?

1:12:33.892 --> 1:12:35.226
-A giant creature?
-He can't be serious.

1:12:35.310 --> 1:12:38.813
Okay, listen. This place,
this world that we live on,

1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:40.190
is a living thing.

1:12:40.356 --> 1:12:42.025
And Pando is killing it.

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:44.736
If we want to survive,
Pando has to go.

1:12:44.819 --> 1:12:45.820
-What?
-What?

1:12:45.904 --> 1:12:47.322
-You want us to destroy Pando?
-JAEGER: Pfft!

1:12:47.405 --> 1:12:49.365
They don't know
what they saw out there.

1:12:49.449 --> 1:12:51.201
Dad? Dad, stop.

1:12:51.493 --> 1:12:52.494
Where are you going?

1:12:52.577 --> 1:12:54.287
To the other side of the mountains.

1:12:54.370 --> 1:12:55.997
I'm gonna see this for myself.

1:12:56.164 --> 1:12:58.500
Are you serious? This world is dying.

1:12:58.583 --> 1:13:00.043
-I need your help.
-

1:13:00.126 --> 1:13:02.045
What do you know about this world?

1:13:02.212 --> 1:13:03.254
What do I know about this world?

1:13:03.338 --> 1:13:04.339
I know what I saw.

1:13:04.506 --> 1:13:06.091
I dedicated my whole life

1:13:06.174 --> 1:13:08.718
to doing something
that no one has ever done,

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:12.555
and I did everything I could
to train you up

1:13:12.722 --> 1:13:14.849
so that you could be
right there with me

1:13:14.933 --> 1:13:16.017
when I did it.

1:13:16.184 --> 1:13:19.020
This was supposed to be our legacy.

1:13:19.187 --> 1:13:20.814
Father and son.

1:13:20.980 --> 1:13:22.565
You wanna talk about legacy?

1:13:22.649 --> 1:13:24.067
I'm about to destroy mine.

1:13:24.734 --> 1:13:25.985
For my son.

1:13:26.069 --> 1:13:27.153
Something you could never do.

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:28.404
Oh, right.

1:13:28.488 --> 1:13:30.073
Because I'm a horrible father.

1:13:30.156 --> 1:13:31.157
Yeah.

1:13:31.783 --> 1:13:33.368
But you didn't have to be.

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:39.582
Here.

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:42.377
The other side of the mountains
is due east.

1:13:55.140 --> 1:13:56.224
Okay.

1:13:56.307 --> 1:13:57.892
Callisto?
-ETHAN: Dad.

1:13:57.976 --> 1:13:59.018
Get your hands off me.

1:13:59.102 --> 1:14:00.854
Emotions are running
really high right now.

1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:03.731
And I don't know
what you think you saw.

1:14:03.815 --> 1:14:06.734
But we came down here to save Pando.

1:14:06.901 --> 1:14:08.194
That plan hasn't changed.

1:14:08.278 --> 1:14:09.946
You have no idea what you're doing.

1:14:10.029 --> 1:14:12.115
-You are going to destroy Avalonia.
-MERIDIAN: No, let me go!

1:14:12.198 --> 1:14:13.283
SEARCHER: Please,
you gotta listen to me!

1:14:14.742 --> 1:14:16.661
-You're makin' a big mistake.

1:14:16.828 --> 1:14:18.496
You gotta get us outta here.
Unlock this door.

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:21.249
No, you can't do this.
You have to listen to me.

1:14:23.084 --> 1:14:24.377
-

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:26.880
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to see outside.

1:14:26.963 --> 1:14:29.007
Hey, Ethan, you think you can
reach your arm under here

1:14:29.090 --> 1:14:30.258
and up to the door handle?

1:14:30.341 --> 1:14:31.718
-Clearly, no.
-

1:14:31.801 --> 1:14:33.303
-Wait. What's that noise?
-

1:14:34.512 --> 1:14:36.514
-Ugh! No tongue.
-Legend.

1:14:38.141 --> 1:14:40.768
Hey, boy. Hey.
Open the door. Yeah.

1:14:40.852 --> 1:14:42.312
-He can do it. Open the door.
-Open the door.

1:14:42.395 --> 1:14:43.730
MERIDIAN: Come on, Legend.
You can do it.

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:45.106
-Come on, Legend.
-ETHAN: Open the door.

1:14:45.190 --> 1:14:46.191
Open the door.

1:14:46.274 --> 1:14:47.901
MERIDIAN: That's Mama's baby.
That's Mama's baby.

1:14:47.984 --> 1:14:49.360
-You can do it. You can do it.
-SEARCHER: Open the door.

1:14:49.444 --> 1:14:51.446
-Open the door!
-Can you not yell at my dog?

1:14:51.529 --> 1:14:53.072
Well, I wouldn't yell
if he were actually trained.

1:14:53.156 --> 1:14:54.157
He is trained.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:55.867
He hasn't peed in the house
for the last two days.

1:14:55.950 --> 1:14:57.827
We've been on this ship
for the last two days.

1:14:59.454 --> 1:15:01.414
-

1:15:03.666 --> 1:15:05.001
You still have to unlock it.

1:15:05.084 --> 1:15:06.586
There's a switch
right beside the handle.

1:15:06.669 --> 1:15:08.046
Legend, do you see the switch?

1:15:08.213 --> 1:15:09.422
Legend, you see the switch?

1:15:12.133 --> 1:15:13.968
What is that sound?
Is he licking the switch?

1:15:14.427 --> 1:15:15.762
Legend, stop licking the switch.

1:15:15.845 --> 1:15:17.055
-Legend, stop.

1:15:17.138 --> 1:15:18.389
Legend, stop licking the switch.

1:15:18.473 --> 1:15:19.641
Stop licking the switch!

1:15:36.824 --> 1:15:38.284
Okay, what's the plan?

1:15:38.368 --> 1:15:39.786
Let's get back control of this ship.

1:15:39.869 --> 1:15:41.162
-

1:15:42.247 --> 1:15:43.748
-

1:15:43.831 --> 1:15:45.375
I'm not qualified to fly this ship.

1:15:47.335 --> 1:15:48.711
Piloting is hard.

1:15:49.545 --> 1:15:52.090
-Huh, that was easy.
-Okay. What now?

1:15:52.173 --> 1:15:54.050
Pando defenses
are keeping those creatures

1:15:54.133 --> 1:15:55.843
from destroying it from the inside.

1:15:57.553 --> 1:15:59.430
But if I can dig
a hole for them...

1:15:59.597 --> 1:16:00.932
They can take care of the rest.

1:16:01.015 --> 1:16:02.684
I'll keep Callisto off your back.

1:16:02.767 --> 1:16:04.269
And you keep our son safe out there.

1:16:04.435 --> 1:16:06.562
Wait, what?
He is not coming with me.

1:16:06.646 --> 1:16:08.147
Tell him that.

1:16:08.231 --> 1:16:10.149
Hey, you comin' or what?
We're on the clock.

1:16:17.865 --> 1:16:20.493
Remember, everybody,
Avalonia's depending on us.

1:16:22.370 --> 1:16:24.038
Oh, was that Searcher and Ethan?

1:16:24.914 --> 1:16:25.915
What's happening?

1:16:27.709 --> 1:16:30.670
Argh! They took the bridge.
Come on.

1:16:35.425 --> 1:16:36.759
-

1:17:09.167 --> 1:17:11.419
-

1:17:17.258 --> 1:17:18.343
Right there.

1:17:18.426 --> 1:17:19.761
Where all the roots converge.

1:17:19.927 --> 1:17:21.262
If the Reapers attack that,

1:17:21.346 --> 1:17:22.847
the rest of the plant will crumble.

1:17:24.182 --> 1:17:26.559
Meridian, open this door.

1:17:26.642 --> 1:17:27.935
Sorry. Can't hear ya.

1:17:28.102 --> 1:17:30.063
Don't worry, President Mal.

1:17:30.229 --> 1:17:31.606
I got this.

1:17:34.901 --> 1:17:36.444
Wait here.

1:17:41.407 --> 1:17:43.076
You and Splat round up
every creature you can

1:17:43.159 --> 1:17:44.452
-and you send them my way.
-

1:17:44.535 --> 1:17:46.329
-I'll do the rest.
-You've got it, Dad.

1:17:48.206 --> 1:17:49.415
I'm sorry if I ever made you think

1:17:49.499 --> 1:17:51.626
that you had to be a farmer
to make me proud.

1:17:52.210 --> 1:17:53.211
I'm always proud of you.

1:17:53.378 --> 1:17:55.380
I know, Dad. I know.

1:18:07.225 --> 1:18:09.394
Let go of those controls.

1:18:09.894 --> 1:18:11.062
-Okay.
-

1:18:14.524 --> 1:18:15.775
Grab the controls.

1:18:15.858 --> 1:18:18.111
Put 'em on, take 'em off,
put 'em on, take 'em...

1:18:18.194 --> 1:18:19.320
Make up your mind.

1:18:24.742 --> 1:18:25.743
Ugh!

1:18:32.875 --> 1:18:35.420
-

1:18:38.506 --> 1:18:40.174
Hey, guys. Remember me?

1:18:45.012 --> 1:18:47.974
Meridian,
stop this ship right now.

1:18:48.057 --> 1:18:49.976
No problem. We're here.

1:18:53.938 --> 1:18:55.481
Now do you see
what we're dealing with?

1:18:56.065 --> 1:18:57.942
-That's a heart.
-

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.745
-

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.474
-SEARCHER: No.
-

1:19:31.434 --> 1:19:32.935
JAEGER: On your feet, Searcher.

1:19:34.437 --> 1:19:35.438
Dad?

1:19:46.032 --> 1:19:48.534
My legacy isn't those mountains.

1:19:49.410 --> 1:19:51.746
It's you.

1:19:53.414 --> 1:19:54.832
Now let's do this.

1:19:55.917 --> 1:19:57.251
Father and son.

1:20:16.103 --> 1:20:17.104
There.

1:20:29.325 --> 1:20:30.326
Keep digging.

1:20:39.335 --> 1:20:40.336
ETHAN: Dad!

1:20:41.420 --> 1:20:42.838
Get out of the way!
Here they come!

1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:03.276
-

1:21:32.471 --> 1:21:34.348
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

1:21:38.811 --> 1:21:41.480
-Yes! Yeah!

1:21:41.772 --> 1:21:44.233
Yeah, we did it. We did it.

1:21:44.734 --> 1:21:45.735
We did it.

1:21:47.862 --> 1:21:48.863
Right?

1:22:15.598 --> 1:22:16.766
We were too late.

1:22:37.244 --> 1:22:39.372
-

1:23:38.806 --> 1:23:40.516
-

1:23:46.814 --> 1:23:49.066
-SEARCHER: Whoa.
-

1:24:02.997 --> 1:24:03.998
Whew.

1:24:12.173 --> 1:24:13.924
-

1:24:24.810 --> 1:24:27.396
-

1:25:05.226 --> 1:25:06.602
All right, next stop,

1:25:06.685 --> 1:25:09.271
no power, cold coffee
and angry masses.

1:25:09.355 --> 1:25:11.065
Who's ready to go home?

1:25:16.111 --> 1:25:18.447
Actually, I'd like to make one stop

1:25:19.490 --> 1:25:20.574
for my dad.

1:25:40.010 --> 1:25:42.012
-

1:26:17.256 --> 1:26:20.843
I spent my whole life
wondering about this moment.

1:26:22.136 --> 1:26:23.429
What'd it be like?

1:26:23.596 --> 1:26:25.514
What it'd look like?

1:26:25.681 --> 1:26:28.559
What'd it feel like?

1:26:31.145 --> 1:26:32.438
And how does it feel?

1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:34.690
Feels

1:26:35.941 --> 1:26:37.526
perfect.

1:26:38.152 --> 1:26:40.571
-

1:27:15.981 --> 1:27:17.316
ETHAN: Dear Dad,

1:27:17.399 --> 1:27:21.987
though it's been an incredibly
challenging year,

1:27:22.071 --> 1:27:24.740
it's inspiring to see
how resilient people can be.

1:27:29.036 --> 1:27:31.205
-Penelope.

1:27:31.372 --> 1:27:32.665
ETHAN: We can be resourceful.

1:27:36.794 --> 1:27:38.128
Sheldon?

1:27:38.212 --> 1:27:40.255
-ETHAN: We can surprise.
-

1:27:41.507 --> 1:27:43.550
The world's clearly changed.

1:27:43.634 --> 1:27:44.635
MAN: Thanks, man.

1:27:44.718 --> 1:27:46.261
And it continues to change.

1:27:48.013 --> 1:27:50.182
And though we can't live
like we did in the past...

1:27:53.102 --> 1:27:55.604
...we've now given ourselves
a better chance at a future.

1:28:03.028 --> 1:28:06.532
We're not quite there yet,
but we will be.

1:28:08.450 --> 1:28:10.619
Because the best legacy
we can leave

1:28:10.786 --> 1:28:13.288
is making a present
worth opening tomorrow.

1:28:14.957 --> 1:28:16.041
Thank you

1:28:16.542 --> 1:28:18.127
for everything you've given me.

1:28:19.753 --> 1:28:21.672
I'll do my best
to live up to your legacy.

1:28:22.965 --> 1:28:24.383
I hope I make you proud.

1:28:25.050 --> 1:28:26.135
Love always,

1:28:26.677 --> 1:28:27.928
your son.

1:39:40.934 --> 1:39:42.477
They're the Clades

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:43.853
They're the Clades

1:39:43.937 --> 1:39:46.981
Cue the band
And start the grand parades

1:39:47.065 --> 1:39:48.650
Ever bold

1:39:48.733 --> 1:39:50.110
Hearts of gold

1:39:50.193 --> 1:39:51.695
Over sea and sky and land

1:39:51.778 --> 1:39:53.238
Bound together hand in hand

1:39:53.321 --> 1:39:55.031
They're the Clades

1:39:56.783 --> 1:39:59.744
MALE SINGER:
Forging brave new chapters

1:39:59.828 --> 1:40:02.831
Of their legacy

1:40:02.914 --> 1:40:05.959
Facing every scrape and jam

1:40:06.042 --> 1:40:08.712
As a mighty family

1:40:15.093 --> 1:40:16.469
MALE CHORUS:
They're the Clades

1:40:16.553 --> 1:40:18.012
They're the Clades

1:40:18.096 --> 1:40:21.182
Worthy of the highest accolades

1:40:21.266 --> 1:40:22.642
Standing tall

1:40:22.726 --> 1:40:24.269
Risking all

1:40:24.352 --> 1:40:25.770
Braving roads beyond the maps

1:40:25.854 --> 1:40:27.522
Bounding generation gaps

1:40:28.982 --> 1:40:30.608
They're the Clades

1:40:39.868 --> 1:40:41.703
Whether farming or exploring

1:40:41.786 --> 1:40:42.954
Raise up your voice in roaring

1:40:43.037 --> 1:40:44.372
Serenades

1:40:44.456 --> 1:40:45.999
For the Clades

1:40:46.082 --> 1:40:49.794
And their endless escapades

1:40:50.587 --> 1:40:51.963
They're the Clades
