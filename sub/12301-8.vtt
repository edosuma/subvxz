WEBVTT

00:37.971 --> 00:39.412
Who's there?

00:58.928 --> 01:00.627
Mr. Bremen?

01:10.613 --> 01:12.407
Mr. Bremen?

01:26.945 --> 01:28.871
Victim's name is Stephen bremen,

01:28.871 --> 01:30.365
an options trader.

01:30.365 --> 01:32.977
Janitor says Stephen often worked late.

01:32.977 --> 01:34.553
We got a hunting knife.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.416
That's strange. / What?

01:36.416 --> 01:38.364
No blood away from the body.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.961
Usually when you slice someone,

01:39.961 --> 01:42.819
the stabber usually nicks themselves.

01:42.819 --> 01:44.159
Because the knife slips.

01:44.159 --> 01:47.291
Yes, and they get to drip their
own blood on the way out.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.939
Wait, hold on.
Alexx, don't move him yet.

01:50.939 --> 01:52.026
Okay.

01:52.026 --> 01:53.468
Care to share with us?

01:53.468 --> 01:55.685
The computer stays on during a blackout.

01:55.685 --> 01:58.238
Uninterruptible power supply.

01:59.313 --> 02:02.059
Switches to battery when the power goes out.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.563
What's happening on the screen?

02:06.915 --> 02:08.662
Nose is pushing the j key.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.678
Probably been that way since the attack.

02:10.678 --> 02:12.572
Gives us an actual time of death.

02:12.572 --> 02:14.373
I can measure the keyboard rate,

02:14.373 --> 02:16.915
count the js, get us within five minutes.

02:16.915 --> 02:20.303
Okay, we got 7:22 A.M.
Mark that, Alexx.

02:21.062 --> 02:23.889
Found a laptop case over there, no laptop.

02:23.889 --> 02:26.467
The killer probably took it with him.

02:26.467 --> 02:28.972
With whatever information is on there.

02:28.972 --> 02:30.718
Throat is slit pretty deep.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.843
Indicates a crime of passion.

02:36.343 --> 02:37.603
Stiletto heels.

02:37.603 --> 02:41.501
Stiletto heels, champagne, candles.

02:41.501 --> 02:46.519
Our Mr. Bremen was on one killer date.

03:21.931 --> 03:25.204
MIAMI
2x08 Big Brother

03:44.953 --> 03:47.501
Did we find the bottle that this goes to?

03:47.501 --> 03:50.788
No, but it could've fallen under there months ago.

03:50.788 --> 03:53.213
Yes, I would agree with that,

03:53.213 --> 03:54.962
only this has blood on it.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.889
Our killer just made their second mistake.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.076
What was his first?

04:01.076 --> 04:03.645
the first mistake was murder.
Hang on a second.

04:05.857 --> 04:08.517
Yeah, Horatio. Mm-hmm.

04:08.517 --> 04:11.078
Wait a second.
What are you talking about?

04:13.960 --> 04:15.504
Okay.

04:15.504 --> 04:17.396
Hang on to her. Yeah.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.649
Uh... I have to go.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.024
I have to go. Keep me posted.

04:23.024 --> 04:24.546
Yes, of course.

04:36.583 --> 04:37.758
Officer.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.132
And you're sure she mentioned
my brother Raymond?

04:42.132 --> 04:43.701
You were the name she was
really throwing around.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.923
Stopped her for no brake lights.

04:45.923 --> 04:48.344
Offered to fix it,
found a twisty of meth.

04:48.344 --> 04:50.822
She swore it wasn't hers,
kept saying you could vouch for her.

04:50.822 --> 04:53.392
I was taking her down for booking
until she came up with your card.

04:53.392 --> 04:55.061
Bottom of her purse.

05:02.741 --> 05:04.007
Suzie.

05:04.573 --> 05:06.427
Thank god you're here.

05:08.112 --> 05:09.938
So you're back from indiana.

05:09.938 --> 05:12.569
Yeah, finished out my probation,

05:12.569 --> 05:14.008
missed the sun.

05:14.008 --> 05:15.914
Came back down a few months ago.

05:16.778 --> 05:19.034
You said if I was ever in trouble...

05:19.034 --> 05:20.301
so you're using again.

05:20.301 --> 05:23.291
No, no, I'm off meth.
I'm totally clean.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.675
- Suzie...
- Horatio, I'm clean.

05:24.675 --> 05:26.887
I don't know how that stuff got in the car.

05:26.887 --> 05:28.386
Car's not registered to her.

05:28.386 --> 05:31.004
Yeah, a friend loaned it
to me to get to my job.

05:31.004 --> 05:33.551
I'm handing out towels at the Agramonte.

05:34.926 --> 05:38.302
Pupils are good.
See, I'm clean.

05:38.302 --> 05:41.025
Okay, let's get a female officer.
We'll get a urine sample.

05:41.025 --> 05:42.898
Suzie, if you pop positive,
I can't help you.

05:42.898 --> 05:44.040
Yeah, I won't let you down.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.505
As long as we're understood.

05:46.310 --> 05:47.445
Take a seat.

05:47.822 --> 05:48.885
Sir, please.

05:48.885 --> 05:51.264
Fine, I understand... Fine.

05:51.264 --> 05:52.911
uh, excuse me.

05:52.911 --> 05:57.171
That computer contains proprietary
information about our company.

05:57.171 --> 05:58.564
It's part of a crime scene, sir.

05:58.564 --> 06:01.696
There's nothing on there related
to anything but market trading.

06:01.696 --> 06:04.812
As founding partner, I monitor
the usage of all of our computers.

06:05.251 --> 06:06.286
Spyware?

06:06.286 --> 06:07.422
It's perfectly legal.

06:07.422 --> 06:09.842
Only way to monitor our
employees' computer usage.

06:09.842 --> 06:12.706
Well, maybe that's why our
victim brought in his laptop

06:12.706 --> 06:15.832
because he didn't want anybody
knowing what he was doing.

06:15.832 --> 06:18.104
I just found this in the laptop bag.

06:18.104 --> 06:20.448
It's a case for a WIFI card.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.278
WIFI?

06:21.278 --> 06:23.314
Wireless internet access.

06:23.314 --> 06:25.556
You can surf the web by using radio waves,

06:25.556 --> 06:28.929
bypassing any monitoring by big brother.

06:28.929 --> 06:32.136
We don't have wireless access
here for just that reason.

06:32.136 --> 06:35.413
Well, do you have any businesses
on the floors above you or below you?

06:35.413 --> 06:37.123
We have the whole building.

06:37.433 --> 06:39.149
Tim, what's the range of WIFI?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.891
Depends on the equipment you're using.

06:54.961 --> 06:58.402
So someone was using my internet
connection without me knowing.

06:59.423 --> 07:01.434
Yeah, it's called war chalking.

07:01.434 --> 07:04.939
The offender scans for unsecured wireless access

07:04.939 --> 07:06.726
and they just jump on it.

07:10.409 --> 07:11.870
E-mail.

07:13.544 --> 07:16.496
So I'm assuming that your
screen name is M.Greenwell.

07:16.496 --> 07:17.564
Yes.

07:17.564 --> 07:19.213
Any idea who roughtrader is?

07:19.213 --> 07:20.496
No.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.410
Why? Is that on my server?

07:22.410 --> 07:25.534
Given that he was an options trader,

07:25.534 --> 07:28.815
roughtrader was probably our victim stephen bremen.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.420
I see why he was bypassing his office computer.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.061
Stephen bremen was using this
server to look for prostitution.

07:36.061 --> 07:38.956
He offered $1,000 to meet in his office last night,

07:38.956 --> 07:40.829
someone named Amanda.

07:40.829 --> 07:43.830
Okay, so the question is who's Amanda?

07:50.580 --> 07:52.058
I told you I was clean.

07:52.058 --> 07:56.030
Yes, you did.
Trust, but verify, Suzie.

07:56.030 --> 07:56.844
Thank you.

07:57.570 --> 08:01.154
The registered owner of the vehicle
is a man named Robert keaton.

08:01.154 --> 08:02.324
How do you know him?

08:02.324 --> 08:04.024
He's my husband.

08:06.335 --> 08:08.656
We're... off and on.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.234
We were off when I met you.

08:10.234 --> 08:13.012
Okay, so the meth we found in
the trunk is his, I take it.

08:13.012 --> 08:14.728
It was only 20 grams.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.709
I mean, that's personal use.
It's not like he was selling.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.225
Suzie.

08:19.169 --> 08:21.638
He's a good guy. Really.

08:21.638 --> 08:24.452
You know, he works in a pet store.

08:24.452 --> 08:27.908
Seriously, he is so gentle with animals and kids...

08:27.908 --> 08:31.588
Suzie. Let's go talk to Bob, all right?

08:31.588 --> 08:32.921
Okay.

08:36.032 --> 08:38.953
I don't know if he's here.
He keeps funny hours.

08:39.668 --> 08:41.083
Come on in.

08:41.724 --> 08:44.580
Bob?
Bobby?

08:45.175 --> 08:46.337
Don't be mad at me.

08:47.431 --> 08:50.015
What is this? Who are you?

08:50.015 --> 08:50.885
Bob,

08:50.885 --> 08:54.026
we located methamphetamine
in a car registered to you,

08:54.026 --> 08:56.581
and now you will be detained
for questioning.

08:56.581 --> 08:58.294
Are you kidding me?

08:58.294 --> 08:59.198
Suzie, what are you an
idiot bringing them here?

08:59.198 --> 09:01.999
What'd you do, drive up on
a curb again, you stupid bitch?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.037
I ought to crack your head. / Hey,

09:04.037 --> 09:05.441
hey, Bob.

09:05.441 --> 09:09.255
The next time you feel like taking a
swing at somebody you start with me.

09:09.255 --> 09:11.301
You understand me?

09:13.229 --> 09:14.479
He'll be good, Horatio.

09:14.479 --> 09:16.072
Don't stick up for me.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.993
Daddy.

09:19.806 --> 09:21.762
I got a cut.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.760
Oh, sweetheart.

09:29.832 --> 09:31.383
What, you want to arrest my kid, too?

09:31.383 --> 09:32.604
Put a four-year-old behind bars?

09:32.604 --> 09:33.673
Shut up.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.442
Take him out to the radio car.

09:36.991 --> 09:38.417
Madison, I'll be back, okay?

09:38.417 --> 09:40.583
Daddy loves you, Maddy.
Daddy'll be back.

09:40.583 --> 09:43.083
- Daddy loves his Maddy.
- Come on. / I'll be back.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.526
Just a second,honey.
I'm going to go get something to clean that up.

09:45.526 --> 09:46.810
I'll be right back.

09:52.199 --> 09:53.189
Hi.

09:54.143 --> 09:57.253
Well, that's a cut.

09:57.253 --> 09:59.532
You know what I do with a cut, Madison?

09:59.532 --> 10:02.696
I take something like this

10:02.696 --> 10:06.489
and I put it very gently on top of it.

10:06.489 --> 10:10.113
And usually,
that makes it feel better.

10:10.113 --> 10:11.784
Does that feel better?

10:11.784 --> 10:14.299
Good. You see?

10:15.773 --> 10:18.867
Here you go. / Hey. Okay.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.701
Can I speak to you for a minute, please?

10:21.701 --> 10:26.083
Hold this, sweetie.
Push down, okay?

10:29.643 --> 10:32.700
Whose child is this, and I want the truth.

10:35.163 --> 10:36.720
She isn't Raymond's. / Suzie.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.358
She's Bob's. / She's bob's?

10:38.358 --> 10:39.630
Take a look at her.

10:39.630 --> 10:40.994
Horatio, don't dig up trouble.

10:40.994 --> 10:43.350
For all I know, she is Bob's.

10:43.350 --> 10:46.157
Did Raymond know about her?

10:47.391 --> 10:50.655
Suzie, did he know about her?

10:51.795 --> 10:54.424
No, he died before I could
tell him I was pregnant.

10:58.561 --> 11:00.870
I know what you're going to do with that.

11:00.870 --> 11:03.942
Trust but verify? / Trust but verify.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.963
Now, Madison...

11:09.963 --> 11:13.740
you and I will speak real soon, okay?

11:14.680 --> 11:16.608
Good girl.

11:28.538 --> 11:30.263
Hey. / Hey.

11:30.263 --> 11:32.885
Do me a favor, will you?
Um, run this meth.

11:32.885 --> 11:35.066
Major and minor components.

11:35.066 --> 11:38.146
I'm going to have to broom
some of my A.V. Stuff over to Eric.

11:38.146 --> 11:40.014
- Okay. I appreciate that.
- No problem.

11:40.014 --> 11:41.598
Horatio. / Yeah. Hey.

11:41.598 --> 11:43.361
Are you okay? / Um...

11:43.361 --> 11:44.764
You left our scene pretty quick.

11:44.764 --> 11:46.767
I had to...

11:46.767 --> 11:49.804
I have an old contact that's got
herself in a bind, and, uh...

11:49.804 --> 11:51.195
Fight?

11:51.195 --> 11:52.198
Bloody nose?

11:52.198 --> 11:54.478
Something like that.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.955
Raymond.

11:59.816 --> 12:00.974
What about him?

12:00.974 --> 12:02.870
Well, whenever he didn't
want to tell me something

12:02.870 --> 12:04.867
he couldn't make eye contact either.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.929
So what is going on?

12:08.420 --> 12:10.899
Well, I'm, uh,
I'm working on something

12:10.899 --> 12:13.121
that I can't talk about yet,
but as soon as I can,

12:13.121 --> 12:15.610
I'll let you know, all right?

12:17.283 --> 12:18.783
Fair enough. / Okay.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.916
You wanted to see me, sir?

12:22.916 --> 12:25.627
Yes, uh... do me a favor and

12:25.627 --> 12:27.068
process this, will you?

12:27.068 --> 12:29.229
I'm doing the blood on the
bottle cap from your stockbroker.

12:29.229 --> 12:30.538
What's your time frame?

12:30.538 --> 12:32.126
ASAP.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.185
That can be arranged.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.762
All right, thank you.

13:14.442 --> 13:16.091
The body of an undercover police detective,

13:16.091 --> 13:17.822
Raymond caine, was discovered today.

13:17.822 --> 13:20.895
Can you comment on the death
of your brother, Raymond caine?

13:21.470 --> 13:23.428
Was he involved in any illegal activities?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.991
Are you aware Internal affair's
conducting an investigation?

13:25.991 --> 13:29.746
Lieutenant caine, can you comment
on the death of your brother Raymond caine?

13:31.465 --> 13:35.874
Raymond caine's partner was detective John hagen.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.998
Was detective caine involved in a crystal
methamphetamine production ring?

13:41.998 --> 13:45.807
What do you have to say about allegations
your brother was addicted?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.500
Doctor says the cause of death
was a bullet to the heart.

13:54.690 --> 13:56.528
This fast enough for you?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.820
Blood on the kerchief.

14:00.426 --> 14:01.858
Have anything to compare it to?

14:01.858 --> 14:05.754
No, no. uh... thank you.

14:06.574 --> 14:08.268
Sure.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.666
Raymond.

14:33.021 --> 14:34.989
I've managed to reconstruct overwritten data

14:34.989 --> 14:36.874
to isolate our victim's activity.

14:37.786 --> 14:39.818
English, please.

14:39.818 --> 14:42.152
Roughtrader was on every night this week.

14:42.152 --> 14:43.741
Always on the same site?

14:43.741 --> 14:44.928
What is that?

14:44.928 --> 14:48.191
Ah, yes, the ever popular sorority exposed.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.362
Is that internet porn?

14:49.362 --> 14:52.632
Not like you're thinking.
Um, it's a webcam site.

14:52.632 --> 14:53.743
Oh. What's the difference?

14:53.743 --> 14:56.608
A webcam is a live camera that, uh,

14:56.608 --> 14:59.426
people broadcast from their home or office, 24/7.

14:59.426 --> 15:00.936
Yeah, but in this case, the home

15:00.936 --> 15:02.780
is a, uh, sorority house,

15:02.780 --> 15:04.592
in miami beach, florida.

15:04.592 --> 15:07.377
40 cameras, 10 rooms.

15:07.377 --> 15:09.659
Including the bathroom?

15:10.048 --> 15:11.521
And showers.

15:12.815 --> 15:15.556
Well, you don't seem very surprised.

15:15.556 --> 15:19.318
- I don't look at this specific site.
- It's general knowledge that they exist,

15:19.318 --> 15:20.996
- and people know about them.
- Sometimes I think

15:20.996 --> 15:22.106
I am in the wrong business.

15:22.106 --> 15:26.276
This site gets, like,
18,000 worldwide subscribers at

15:26.276 --> 15:28.994
40 bucks a pop a month.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.955
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Amanda.

15:30.955 --> 15:33.506
That's the name of the girl who was
soliciting our victim via e-mail.

15:33.506 --> 15:35.639
They were supposed to
meet the night of his death.

15:35.639 --> 15:37.465
At what time? /10:00 P.M..

15:37.465 --> 15:39.622
That's what Speedle
said the time of death was.

15:39.622 --> 15:42.166
Said he counted the js,
whatever that means.

15:42.166 --> 15:43.512
Well, that means we have a suspect.

15:43.512 --> 15:46.134
Can you get us a brick and mortar
location for this site?

15:46.134 --> 15:47.612
Not for the sorority house.

15:47.612 --> 15:50.441
They keep that a pretty tight secret, but...

15:57.714 --> 16:00.880
The company that owns it is
in the corsair industrial park.

16:01.551 --> 16:02.655
That's great.

16:08.051 --> 16:11.629
The sorority is, by far, the most
successful of our sites.

16:11.629 --> 16:15.928
About 70,000 hits a day
in 32 countries.

16:15.928 --> 16:18.492
What does that translate to in dollars?

16:18.492 --> 16:21.479
8.5 a year, gross.

16:21.479 --> 16:24.234
Does that include your take of the prostitution?

16:24.234 --> 16:27.119
The girls that work for me are not prostitutes.

16:28.109 --> 16:30.139
I'm telling you, these girls

16:30.139 --> 16:32.346
are clean-cut girls.

16:32.346 --> 16:35.094
They're clean-cut girls
who take showers on cameras

16:35.094 --> 16:37.261
that broadcast all over the world.

16:37.261 --> 16:39.799
We're going to need you
to take us to the sorority.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.380
No problem.

16:43.006 --> 16:44.593
Right this way.

16:51.394 --> 16:53.106
This is it.

16:53.106 --> 16:54.438
A fake house?

16:54.438 --> 16:55.550
Want the tour?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.020
This is unbelievable.

17:01.306 --> 17:03.121
It has all the comforts of home.

17:03.121 --> 17:04.959
hot and cold running water,

17:04.959 --> 17:08.050
four showers, full working kitchen.

17:08.050 --> 17:11.477
And plus, full access for all the cameras.

17:11.477 --> 17:13.781
And it's all run from a control room in the back.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.055
Are you webcasting now?

17:15.055 --> 17:16.538
24/7.

17:18.451 --> 17:20.013
Turn it off.

17:20.013 --> 17:21.741
We're going to need to talk to Amanda.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.901
Uh, you're going to have to do it on camera.

17:23.901 --> 17:26.031
We promise the public full access.

17:26.031 --> 17:29.786
Well, that's fine. I would never turn down
an invitation to a suspect's home.

17:32.045 --> 17:34.717
Okay, I'm going to need
to take a look at the control room.

17:34.717 --> 17:36.046
Behind that flat.

17:40.191 --> 17:42.241
I got your page. / Yeah.

17:43.457 --> 17:45.170
I'm thinking about taking another look

17:45.170 --> 17:46.686
into Raymond's murder,

17:46.686 --> 17:48.315
and since you were his partner, John...

17:48.315 --> 17:49.857
IAB told me never to discuss it.

17:49.857 --> 17:53.288
I'm curious about why you weren't
with him the night he was killed.

17:53.288 --> 17:55.876
He didn't tell me he was making that drug buy.

17:55.876 --> 17:56.976
Think we both know what that means.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.204
Okay, why don't you give me your version?

17:59.204 --> 18:01.512
Hey, it's not my fault.

18:01.512 --> 18:02.918
I tried to help him as much as I could.

18:02.918 --> 18:06.780
I want to know why you put in for a
transfer the week before he was killed.

18:09.997 --> 18:12.062
He was seeing this tweaker girl.

18:13.084 --> 18:15.962
Drugs, women.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.730
I had to get away from it.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.926
I tried to pull him out, I did.

18:18.926 --> 18:22.500
While they were busy processing your transfer.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.320
Right?

18:24.320 --> 18:25.725
You want to know the truth, Horatio?

18:25.725 --> 18:28.328
Yeah, John, I do.

18:28.882 --> 18:31.021
Raymond got himself killed.

18:31.620 --> 18:33.556
He had a lot of help, John.

18:34.272 --> 18:35.952
A lot of help.

18:46.295 --> 18:47.691
Is this the meth sample?

18:47.691 --> 18:50.353
Yeah. From Suzie's car trunk.

18:50.353 --> 18:51.799
Pretty normal ingredients for meth,

18:51.799 --> 18:54.392
except the pseudoephedrine,

18:54.392 --> 18:57.867
um, which is the kind that animal vets use.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.741
So we have the cook.

18:59.741 --> 19:00.896
How do you figure?

19:00.896 --> 19:04.826
Our suspect works in a pet store.

19:07.306 --> 19:08.653
Hang on a second.

19:09.355 --> 19:10.592
Yeah.

19:12.088 --> 19:13.950
Okay, what is she doing now?

19:15.004 --> 19:17.785
Just hang on to her.
Thanks.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.655
This is the conditions of your bail.

19:23.655 --> 19:25.720
I want you to read all of it.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.857
Suzie,

19:27.857 --> 19:29.564
what are you doing?

19:29.564 --> 19:30.997
I'm posting Bob's bail.

19:30.997 --> 19:31.922
Yes, I can see that.

19:31.922 --> 19:34.355
Why on earth would you be doing that?

19:34.355 --> 19:37.438
I guess to make up for getting him arrested.

19:37.438 --> 19:39.225
Really? Is that what it is?

19:39.225 --> 19:42.026
It has nothing to do with the
condition of your arms right now?

19:42.026 --> 19:44.873
You didn't get those banging into walls.

19:45.304 --> 19:46.637
What's going on?

19:46.637 --> 19:48.541
Initial every paragraph.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.949
Temper gets the best of him sometimes.

19:51.949 --> 19:55.019
Ray slapped him down once,

19:55.019 --> 19:56.550
put him in check for a little while.

19:56.550 --> 19:58.113
How did Bob feel about that?

19:58.113 --> 20:00.497
Oh, he didn't like it. But

20:00.497 --> 20:02.177
he was too scared to hit Ray back.

20:02.177 --> 20:04.784
Mm-hmm.
What does this have to do with you?

20:07.479 --> 20:12.192
I'm stuck in a bit of loop, you know?

20:12.192 --> 20:16.273
It's almost like taking care
of him keeps me off the meth.

20:16.273 --> 20:18.373
Who's taking care of Madison
while this is happening?

20:18.373 --> 20:20.900
You remember Madison, don't you?
Ray's daughter.

20:21.866 --> 20:23.498
- Test came back.
- Yes, they did,

20:23.498 --> 20:27.041
and Madison belongs to Ray, Suzie.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.603
Sign here.

20:30.603 --> 20:32.780
Can you keep him away when he does get released?

20:32.780 --> 20:35.625
Only if you don't post this bail.

20:45.671 --> 20:46.495
What's with the bathing suits?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.425
Do you have a pool around here?

20:48.425 --> 20:49.624
Tanning bed.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.206
The girls hate tan lines, so

20:51.206 --> 20:53.879
the cameras in there tend
to be among our most popular.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.333
Here's Amanda's room.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.753
You got no sound. Huh?

21:05.753 --> 21:08.961
There's no sound on any of these cameras.

21:08.961 --> 21:11.744
Uh, no. it take too much bandwidth.

21:13.948 --> 21:16.693
40 cameras and nothing
going on with any of them?

21:16.693 --> 21:18.904
It's like a slot machine.

21:18.904 --> 21:21.917
People hope they'll click on a camera
during an unscheduled event.

21:21.917 --> 21:25.394
girls changing clothes,
taking a shower, stuff like that.

21:26.613 --> 21:29.185
Aah! a snake could have scored on that.

21:29.185 --> 21:32.858
I used to play with that guy.
He sucked then, too.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.627
How many, uh, subscribers
do you have logged onto the site?

21:35.627 --> 21:38.346
Guy got my draft position
when I shattered my knee.

21:38.346 --> 21:40.410
That's too bad.
What I asked you was,

21:40.410 --> 21:43.851
how many people do you have
logged onto the site right now?

21:43.851 --> 21:46.638
153. And going up now

21:46.638 --> 21:50.974
because Tiffany is about
to use the tanning bed.

21:50.974 --> 21:52.722
And how do they know
she's going to do that?

21:52.722 --> 21:55.666
She calls it appointment television.

21:58.254 --> 22:01.417
230 hits and counting.

22:02.765 --> 22:06.092
Hmm. It looks like Amanda is back in her room.

22:06.655 --> 22:08.069
I just want to ask you a couple of questions

22:08.069 --> 22:10.970
if you don't mind, just about your environment.

22:10.970 --> 22:14.686
Whoa! You have a badge and a gun!

22:14.686 --> 22:18.191
You're going to make the chat room heat up.

22:18.191 --> 22:21.160
Well, thank you,
but let's just stick to the question.

22:21.160 --> 22:25.150
So, you actually get paid to live here?

22:25.150 --> 22:28.118
Mm-hmm. I get a paycheck and benefits.

22:28.118 --> 22:30.626
Free room and board.
And, uh,

22:30.626 --> 22:32.113
all I have to do is live my life.

22:32.113 --> 22:36.016
But it must not pay enough
if you have to solicit on the side.

22:37.165 --> 22:38.347
I don't know what you mean.

22:38.347 --> 22:39.369
We have an e-mail that says that you

22:39.369 --> 22:41.905
were supposed to meet someone
by the screen name of roughtrader

22:41.905 --> 22:44.138
for a thousand dollars.

22:44.138 --> 22:45.682
Well, that's not true.

22:45.682 --> 22:47.324
Problem is, is that
roughtrader was murdered

22:47.324 --> 22:48.500
the night you met him.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.103
Well, I never met him.
I have no idea who that is.

22:52.103 --> 22:54.840
Where were you last night at 10:00?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.755
I was here.

22:56.755 --> 22:58.916
Well, that's easy enough to verify.

22:58.916 --> 23:00.201
Yeah.

23:00.201 --> 23:03.796
Do you mind if I borrow your shoes?
The stilettos.

23:03.796 --> 23:05.634
No. Go ahead.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.935
Thanks.

23:12.219 --> 23:13.674
Horatio.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.366
There was a suspect at PD all afternoon,

23:19.366 --> 23:21.757
and every time I went near the holding area,

23:21.757 --> 23:24.666
everybody seemed to hold their breath.

23:24.666 --> 23:28.013
Well, um, it looks like the suspect, Bob,

23:28.013 --> 23:31.638
and his wife knew Raymond.

23:33.241 --> 23:37.401
And? / And, um, well...

23:37.401 --> 23:39.421
uh, Yelina...

23:39.421 --> 23:43.124
please, don't try to sugarcoat it.

23:43.124 --> 23:46.717
I know what Raymond was doing, okay?

23:46.717 --> 23:49.624
You... you,you knew?

23:49.624 --> 23:52.030
Drugs.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.846
Well, he started for the job

23:54.846 --> 23:56.814
so he would gain their trust.

23:56.814 --> 23:59.194
And then he got hooked.

23:59.194 --> 24:01.299
He didn't want Ray junior
and myself to find out,

24:01.299 --> 24:06.452
so he would stay away
for weeks and weeks at a time.

24:06.452 --> 24:10.539
Well, he.. he did it to protect us, yeah.

24:15.769 --> 24:17.825
Is there something else?

24:17.825 --> 24:21.591
Um, there's been a development.
It looks like...

24:21.591 --> 24:23.872
it looks like the meth we found on Raymond's body

24:23.872 --> 24:27.352
matches the signature meth that
we found in the suspect's car.

24:27.352 --> 24:30.069
And we believe that he is the cook

24:30.069 --> 24:31.878
that Raymond was after.

24:31.878 --> 24:33.912
What do you mean?
Are you saying that this Bob

24:33.912 --> 24:35.891
was with Raymond the night he was killed?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.578
At the very least.

24:42.454 --> 24:44.764
Do you have any proof that he killed him?

24:44.764 --> 24:47.063
Not yet, but I am on my way to see Bob.

24:47.063 --> 24:48.338
I want to be there,
when you confront him.

24:48.338 --> 24:49.879
Yelina? / Horatio, please.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.143
I do not think that's a good idea.

24:52.143 --> 24:54.589
Please stop trying to protect me.

24:55.655 --> 24:58.195
That...

24:58.195 --> 25:00.242
is not possible.

25:10.458 --> 25:13.308
PD said Bob made bail.
Where is he? Bob?

25:13.308 --> 25:15.167
- He's not here.
- Don't give me that. Where is he?

25:15.167 --> 25:16.933
He's not here.

25:16.933 --> 25:20.337
You want a... a drink or something?

25:24.180 --> 25:26.717
How did you get that eye?

25:28.408 --> 25:31.080
He just felt so betrayed.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.300
I mean, Madison didn't see anything.
she was asleep.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.353
You are switching addictions.

25:36.353 --> 25:37.694
No, I am clean.

25:37.694 --> 25:40.102
Suzie, Bob is bad news,

25:40.102 --> 25:42.595
and I am getting you and Madison
out of here right now.

25:42.595 --> 25:44.620
- Thanks. We're fine.
- Really? You're fine?

25:44.620 --> 25:46.583
I don't think you understand something.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.652
She is my flesh and blood,

25:48.652 --> 25:51.493
and she will not remain
in this situation another second.

25:51.493 --> 25:52.294
You don't have a say in it.

25:52.294 --> 25:54.136
This is exactly where you are wrong.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.046
I do have a say in it.

25:56.046 --> 25:59.215
What are you going to tell Ray's wife?

25:59.215 --> 26:01.221
You found a baby looks just like him,

26:01.221 --> 26:04.485
thought you'd bring her home
out of the goodness of your heart?

26:06.398 --> 26:09.673
Can you imagine what that
would do to her, Horatio?

26:13.112 --> 26:16.362
Your little brother sure knew
how to mess things up, didn't he?

26:28.080 --> 26:31.593
Where is the pet store that Bob works at?

26:41.025 --> 26:42.988
Hey, Tim, what have you got?

26:42.988 --> 26:46.487
Well, I swabbed Amanda's heel points, and, um,

26:46.487 --> 26:49.944
there are trace amounts of acrylic copolymer

26:49.944 --> 26:51.696
and polyethylene wax.

26:51.696 --> 26:52.770
And those are?

26:52.770 --> 26:56.309
Two main ingredients for industrial floor polish.

27:03.833 --> 27:06.450
Janitor was buffing the floors that night,

27:06.450 --> 27:08.724
so that puts Amanda at the scene.

27:08.724 --> 27:11.243
Well, does it put her there at the right time?

27:12.120 --> 27:14.397
Checked the archive videos from the house.

27:14.397 --> 27:16.967
Found our girl. 10:00 P.M.

27:18.648 --> 27:20.182
And here's Amanda.

27:20.182 --> 27:22.222
Hmm, look at that.

27:22.222 --> 27:25.757
She's fulfilling her contractual shower obligation

27:25.757 --> 27:27.905
that consists of three showers a day,

27:27.905 --> 27:29.963
20 minutes each.

27:29.963 --> 27:32.043
What'd she do after that?

27:32.043 --> 27:33.467
Let's see.

27:36.623 --> 27:40.000
Different camera.
Her bed.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.993
Hmmm.

27:57.512 --> 27:59.990
I'm guessing, but...

27:59.990 --> 28:02.717
I think we can probably find thousands of witnesses

28:02.717 --> 28:05.986
all over the world who could corroborate her alibi.

28:05.986 --> 28:08.294
Then we do not need two more.

28:08.294 --> 28:11.186
Tyler, can you verify that the time
hasn't been doctored?

28:11.186 --> 28:13.800
Yeah, I already ran checksums
on all the files.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.369
Uh, the time's accurate.

28:16.369 --> 28:20.185
So Amanda is not guilty.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.212
Not of murder.

28:32.664 --> 28:35.815
Your shoes place you at the
murder scene of Stephen bremen.

28:35.815 --> 28:39.359
That's roughtrader's real name,
in case you were wondering.

28:39.359 --> 28:41.769
Do you have something that
you want to tell me, Amanda?

28:43.511 --> 28:46.294
Yeah, um...

28:48.774 --> 28:52.117
But I worry about lip readers.

28:59.513 --> 29:01.689
Where did they go?

29:01.689 --> 29:03.147
Blind spot.

29:04.331 --> 29:05.489
Okay...

29:05.489 --> 29:09.232
so, I went to meet him in his office,

29:09.232 --> 29:11.691
and when I got there,

29:11.691 --> 29:12.862
he was...

29:21.329 --> 29:22.692
he was already dead.

29:22.492 --> 29:25.090
I got freaked, and I ran.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.445
Well, you couldn't have been
that freaked out, Amanda,

29:27.445 --> 29:30.890
because your heel prints
go all the way up to the body.

29:30.890 --> 29:34.947
Okay, I kind of sent some
e-mails that crossed the line,

29:35.455 --> 29:37.003
I saw the laptop.

29:37.003 --> 29:38.418
I took it.

29:45.823 --> 29:47.227
Why didn't you just call the police?

29:47.227 --> 29:48.947
Cause I didn't want my boss to find out.

29:48.947 --> 29:50.916
Jason. / He's got this really strict policy

29:50.916 --> 29:53.854
about girls making any outside income.

29:53.854 --> 29:55.591
Where's the laptop now?

29:55.591 --> 29:59.353
I tossed it in a dumpster outside
of the centrust building.

30:19.024 --> 30:20.565
Thank you, officers.

30:22.001 --> 30:24.817
Do you recognize the meth, Bob?

30:24.817 --> 30:29.021
That is the meth that you sold
my brother, Raymond caine,

30:29.021 --> 30:30.875
the night you killed him.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.563
Somebody else killed your brother.

30:32.563 --> 30:35.010
The unknown third party theory.

30:35.010 --> 30:37.884
The guy must've found out
our deal was going down,

30:37.884 --> 30:40.356
Shot Ray, ran off with the money.

30:40.356 --> 30:44.052
And you just took your drugs
and went home that night.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.231
I don't think so, Bob.

30:49.325 --> 30:50.916
You know, internal affairs
couldn't figure this out.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.515
What makes you think
you're so special?

30:52.515 --> 30:59.477
The rumor of a dirty cop, Bob, is far
juicier than a confirmation.

30:59.477 --> 31:01.471
You just called your brother a dirty cop.

31:01.471 --> 31:05.230
And maybe he was, Bob,
but he didn't deserve to die.

31:06.404 --> 31:09.606
We all have to die sometime.

31:11.148 --> 31:12.852
Some...

31:12.852 --> 31:15.297
some sooner than others, Bob.

31:24.577 --> 31:26.150
Suzie!

31:27.912 --> 31:29.651
Hi, madison.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.897
How's your knee?

31:32.897 --> 31:34.635
Good.

31:36.526 --> 31:37.815
Bob's gun.

31:37.815 --> 31:38.754
What are you talking about?

31:38.754 --> 31:41.897
Suzie, don't lie to me,
I know he's got one.

31:42.869 --> 31:44.151
He's still my old man, Horatio.

31:44.151 --> 31:47.229
I checked the shop and the car.
Where is it?

31:50.727 --> 31:55.916
There's a place we used to
go to tweak for.. days at a time.

32:04.652 --> 32:06.530
A lot of contamination here.

32:07.552 --> 32:10.163
Yeah, Delko pulled it out of a dumpster.

32:11.637 --> 32:13.130
Listen, don't power that thing up, all right?

32:13.130 --> 32:17.256
Because, uh, it could corrupt the data
we need to examine on the hard drive.

32:18.119 --> 32:20.995
Hey, you have a, a mound of
something adhered pretty good,

32:20.995 --> 32:22.352
here on the lid.

32:22.352 --> 32:25.056
I'll take the blood for DNA,
and leave the mound for you.

32:25.056 --> 32:26.099
All right, thanks.

32:26.099 --> 32:27.171
Sure.

33:01.353 --> 33:02.578
All right.

33:02.578 --> 33:06.430
on the laptop lid we have cyanoacrylate ester.

33:06.430 --> 33:08.261
Superglue?

33:08.261 --> 33:10.953
Liquid fell from above, dried where it hit.

33:14.388 --> 33:16.921
And you're sure it's not from
supergluing the finger prints?

33:16.921 --> 33:18.787
I didn't use S.G. on this one.

33:18.787 --> 33:20.951
What do you think it means to the case?

33:20.951 --> 33:22.278
I'm working on that.

33:22.278 --> 33:24.467
Hey did you get anything on the hard drive?

33:25.655 --> 33:27.505
Tyler's working on that.

33:31.005 --> 33:32.668
Amanda thought she wiped the hard drive,

33:32.668 --> 33:34.706
but look what I found...

33:38.180 --> 33:39.746
Needle in a haystack.

33:39.746 --> 33:41.036
Not so bad.

33:41.036 --> 33:42.633
These are actually file fragments.

33:42.633 --> 33:44.216
So I ran a grave robber on it.

33:44.216 --> 33:45.298
What's a grave robber?

33:45.298 --> 33:48.391
It's a piece of software
that resurrects deleted files,

33:48.391 --> 33:51.513
figures out which ones go
together and in what order.

33:56.278 --> 33:58.901
And voila. Four html web pages,

33:58.901 --> 34:00.391
two e-mails from that night.

34:00.391 --> 34:02.199
Let's check the e-mail.

34:04.862 --> 34:08.485
Same e-mail we got off the WIFI server
setting the meet for 10 P.M.

34:08.485 --> 34:10.117
What about the second e-mail?

34:13.228 --> 34:15.315
Okay, now that's weird,
because it's also from Amanda

34:15.315 --> 34:16.748
but it says to meet at midnight.

34:16.748 --> 34:18.489
That wasn't on the WIFI server.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.435
Roughtrader was probably using
internet access at a different location

34:21.435 --> 34:23.199
when he received that one.

34:24.141 --> 34:26.636
So is there any way to verify
that the two letters came

34:26.636 --> 34:29.318
from the same computer?
Maybe Amanda's?

34:31.699 --> 34:34.850
Okay, here's the 10:00 appointment.

34:34.850 --> 34:37.435
And here's the midnight appointment.

34:37.435 --> 34:39.922
Let me run an authentication program.

34:45.536 --> 34:47.737
The one that says 10:00 P.M. is a forgery.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.371
Pretty transparent.

34:49.371 --> 34:52.467
The underlying ip address
is different by one digit.

34:53.005 --> 34:55.786
So doesn't that mean that
it comes from a different computer

34:55.786 --> 34:57.402
but at the same location?

34:57.402 --> 34:59.295
Probably.

34:59.295 --> 35:01.644
So the killer's inside the sorority house.

35:10.218 --> 35:13.653
This is the computer the ip address matches.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.145
Matches what?

35:15.145 --> 35:17.985
Our murder victim got an e-mail
from this computer.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.706
No way. It's password protected

35:19.706 --> 35:22.425
and locked when I'm not here.

35:22.425 --> 35:25.311
Then I guess you're the only one
that could have sent the e-mail.

35:26.178 --> 35:28.713
No, I mean...

35:28.713 --> 35:30.663
I didn't send any e-mail to this guy.

35:30.663 --> 35:33.603
I've got a superglue bottle with no cap.

35:33.603 --> 35:36.607
You should really take your
trash out more often, Jason.

35:36.607 --> 35:38.301
This is crazy.

35:40.585 --> 35:43.485
That seem a little convenient to you,
that bottle is still there?

35:43.485 --> 35:45.731
A little bit.

35:45.731 --> 35:50.069
There is one use for superglue
that most people don't think of.

35:50.069 --> 35:52.307
Stand up and show me your hands.

35:59.070 --> 36:00.334
Turn them over.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.401
- He's clean.
- What're you thinking?

36:06.401 --> 36:10.765
Thinking whoever killed our stock broker
used superglue to seal his own wounds.

36:10.765 --> 36:15.119
Well, that would explain why there was only
the killer's blood on the superglue cap.

36:15.119 --> 36:17.149
But that really works?
It seals the wound?

36:17.149 --> 36:19.348
Yeah, athletes use it all the time.

36:19.348 --> 36:21.179
Stops bleeding instantly.

36:33.707 --> 36:34.908
Tell me something, Lloyd.

36:35.909 --> 36:38.687
Did it sting when you put
the superglue in your cut?

36:38.687 --> 36:39.606
What?

36:39.606 --> 36:41.515
- Let me see your hands.
- I'm busy.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.918
They're bringing in the new girl.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.149
She'll never replace Amanda, right, Lloyd?

36:56.367 --> 36:58.763
You sliced the stock broker's throat.

37:15.048 --> 37:18.199
Came back here to frame your boss.

37:18.199 --> 37:20.557
I guess it's okay when a million
guys are looking at Amanda,

37:20.557 --> 37:22.810
but the minute that one guy
wants to touch her,

37:22.810 --> 37:24.917
you had to step in.

37:29.924 --> 37:33.277
It was never about a million guys.

37:33.277 --> 37:34.328
It was about me.

37:36.207 --> 37:38.937
She knew I was in here watching her.

37:38.937 --> 37:42.109
Every time she looked into that camera,

37:42.109 --> 37:45.221
flirted, winked...

37:46.636 --> 37:48.323
she was looking at me.

37:49.494 --> 37:50.823
Not him.

38:10.376 --> 38:13.069
We used to crank out here for days,

38:13.069 --> 38:15.365
smoking off tin.

38:24.030 --> 38:27.101
Bob would start taking TVs apart,

38:27.101 --> 38:28.813
rewiring them.

38:28.813 --> 38:30.718
It's called frankensteining.

38:39.226 --> 38:40.518
Excuse me...

38:55.516 --> 38:58.086
you know what that is, Suzie?

38:59.467 --> 39:00.780
An antenna?

39:00.780 --> 39:04.687
That... is a gun barrel.

40:03.042 --> 40:04.286
Hey.

40:04.586 --> 40:07.582
I heard our guys found
the rest of Bob's gun parts.

40:07.582 --> 40:09.099
Yeah, they did.

40:09.099 --> 40:10.120
What did you get?

40:10.120 --> 40:12.441
The round that killed Raymond
was fired from this barrel.

40:12.441 --> 40:13.636
It's Bob's gun barrel.

40:15.350 --> 40:19.240
Okay, would you mind doing
the paperwork on it?

40:19.240 --> 40:21.485
Of course not.
I'm going to do it right now.

40:23.142 --> 40:24.200
Are you okay?

40:26.122 --> 40:29.085
I am now. Thank you.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.248
So, Bob...

40:34.248 --> 40:35.404
you've had enough.

40:38.101 --> 40:42.536
If you will, Bob, note the gun handle
directly in front of me, please.

40:43.406 --> 40:44.961
Come on, man, that could be anyone's.

40:44.961 --> 40:47.753
Yes, it could, but this one
happens to have your print on it.

40:47.753 --> 40:51.899
Now, the gun barrel to my right shot

40:52.665 --> 40:55.296
this bullet into Raymond caine.

40:56.224 --> 40:57.896
You killed him, Bob.

40:57.896 --> 41:00.646
And now I can prove it.

41:00.646 --> 41:03.670
He was a degenerate.

41:06.342 --> 41:09.624
That may also be true, Bob,
but he was not a coward.

41:09.624 --> 41:13.965
Like you.
He stood up to you for abusing Suzie,

41:13.965 --> 41:16.675
and it got him killed, right?

41:17.950 --> 41:20.327
So you're the big savior, Caine?

41:20.327 --> 41:23.227
Coming in, doing your brother's clean up?

41:23.227 --> 41:25.131
That's what I do.

41:25.131 --> 41:26.961
I clean things up.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.046
Suzie, are you going to be okay?

41:39.046 --> 41:40.936
And I'm moving into the management program,

41:40.936 --> 41:43.937
going to get into advertising for the hotel.

41:46.108 --> 41:47.514
Okay, listen.

41:47.514 --> 41:50.360
I want you to take this.
It's for you and Madison.

41:54.727 --> 41:56.588
I'll pay you back.

41:56.588 --> 41:58.938
Don't worry about it.

41:58.938 --> 41:59.766
Thank you.

41:59.766 --> 42:03.320
And expect more monthly, all right?

42:04.407 --> 42:05.971
Will you come around?

42:05.971 --> 42:08.469
When you least expect it.

42:09.172 --> 42:10.483
I'll still be straight.

42:10.483 --> 42:12.128
Suzie, you have no choice.

42:12.128 --> 42:14.523
You have to worry about somebody else now.

42:14.523 --> 42:16.055
You understand?

42:16.571 --> 42:18.413
Is this the file?

42:18.413 --> 42:20.383
Will you take it to my desk, please?

42:20.383 --> 42:23.586
All right.
You need anything, you call me.

42:23.586 --> 42:24.746
And I mean it.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.865
Got your card.

42:27.865 --> 42:28.851
Okay.

42:32.589 --> 42:34.488
Take care.

42:42.338 --> 42:44.191
Horatio...

42:45.566 --> 42:47.384
D.A.'s going for life on Ray's killer.

42:47.384 --> 42:49.790
Yeah, it looks that way.

42:52.838 --> 42:53.751
Yeah...

42:57.403 --> 42:59.326
Are you okay?

43:00.417 --> 43:01.871
I still miss him.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.290
Me, too.

43:14.588 --> 43:17.875
What was that for?

43:17.875 --> 43:20.939
For finding out the truth about Ray.

43:24.321 --> 43:27.047
You and Ray junior going
