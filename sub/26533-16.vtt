00:01.262 --> 00:03.351
Previously onCharmed...

00:03.394 --> 00:04.787
LUCY: Maggie and Parker
will be fully back together

00:04.830 --> 00:06.615
by spring break.I need them closer than ever.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.617
That's what I'm after.Yes, sir.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.923
Her real name,
it's Fiona Callahan.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.013
As in Charity's sister?
But she's dead.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.319
JADA:
Harry and Charity
don't even know the truth.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.973
FIONA:
It's too late
for Charity and me.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.540
I consider her dead to me.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.498
It's Elder Bari.
She has your results.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.110
So, what were your findings?

00:23.153 --> 00:25.982
Can I be cured?The demon in you
has provided you

00:26.026 --> 00:27.375
with the Evil Sight.

00:27.418 --> 00:30.117
We can use it to find
your mother's murderer.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.560
What is it?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.431
Charity killed our mother.

01:10.635 --> 01:11.854
Morning, sunshine.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.640
You were tossing and turning.
Are you all right?

01:17.468 --> 01:19.427
Oh.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.907
Well, I guess I had a nightmare.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.955
Don't remember it, though.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.261
That's the worst.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.915
Well, breakfast
is ready, so,

01:29.959 --> 01:31.787
time to get a move on.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.093
I... I really overslept.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.311
I hope you don't mind

01:34.355 --> 01:35.704
my helicopter Elder-ing,

01:35.747 --> 01:38.359
but I'm concerned about you,

01:38.402 --> 01:40.491
and I can't pretend
I'm not personally invested

01:40.535 --> 01:41.884
in your well-being.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.886
No, I-I understand.

01:43.929 --> 01:47.716
You know, I have to say,
I was really scared

01:47.759 --> 01:49.892
to talk to the Elders
about my inner demon, but...

01:49.935 --> 01:52.590
We are in this together.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.680
Now, we've got breakfast
waiting for you downstairs.

01:55.724 --> 01:58.770
Harry made English
porridge and muffins.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.469
Sounds delicious.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.776
Thanks, Charity.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.823
Um, I'll see you down there?

02:24.709 --> 02:25.971
Hey.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.670
Hey, look who's
out of hibernation.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.413
Are you all right? Oversleeping
like this is uncharacteristic.

02:32.456 --> 02:36.286
You two really are
helicopter parents. It's cute.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.287
Smile.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.246
Uh, Maggie, can you stop?

02:39.289 --> 02:40.812
MEL:
Seriously, Maggie,

02:40.856 --> 02:42.074
the rest of us
do not want to be background

02:42.118 --> 02:43.815
for your Kappa BTS
whosie-whatsit.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.078
Your what?I don't know.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.689
My Kappa video collage.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.473
Behind the scenes
of my life.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.736
You helped me pick my outfit
last night, remember?

02:51.780 --> 02:53.434
You said this green would pop?

02:53.477 --> 02:54.435
I did?
Yes.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.915
Wow, uh, last night

02:56.959 --> 02:58.874
is a little bit fuzzy
for me for some reason.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.745
Fuzzy?
Mm.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.312
MAGGIE:
Hey, what's that?

03:02.356 --> 03:04.314
Uh, that's weird.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.795
I-I don't remember getting this.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.319
Whoa, are those bruises?Happens to me all the time.
I bruise like a peach.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.799
Hey, so Mel

03:10.842 --> 03:12.627
was gonna walk me
to school. Come with?

03:12.670 --> 03:15.717
Yeah. We wanted to talk
to you about something.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.632
Ooh, Charity,

03:17.675 --> 03:20.243
any chance that was Elder Bari?No, I'm sorry.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.419
I know you're eager
for those test results.

03:22.463 --> 03:25.422
Yeah. It's kind of hard,
not knowing. Um...

03:25.466 --> 03:27.119
Does it usually take this long?

03:27.163 --> 03:29.818
Well, the circumstances
are totally unprecedented,

03:29.861 --> 03:32.037
which is probably why
Elder Bari is taking her time.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.431
HARRY:
Macy, the Elders
will find a solution.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.912
You're gonna be fine.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.392
It's just unsettling.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.958
And it doesn't help
that we have this hidden temple

03:40.002 --> 03:43.005
under the house that could be
ramping up my demon side.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.747
Which is why it is important to
stay out of the Vortex Viribus

03:45.790 --> 03:48.663
for the time being, all of
us, until we sort this out.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.318
Yeah, God knows we don't want
another Freaky Fridayscenario.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.842
Mm.Or a Freaky Tuesday
for that matter.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.757
No, we don't.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.150
Although I do appreciate my
hair's added sheen and bounce.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.370
Argan oil. You're welcome.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.155
MAGGIE:
Come on, Macy.
Let's go.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.462
You're walking with us?

04:05.506 --> 04:06.898
Did you forget
already?

04:06.942 --> 04:08.291
MEL:
You know, that is kind
of weird about last night.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.162
You're usually
like a steel trap.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.556
MAGGIE:
It's been months, and you still
haven't let me live down

04:12.600 --> 04:14.297
that one time I borrowed
your rose gold earrings

04:14.341 --> 04:15.864
without asking permission.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.909
Well, sweet Maggie,
it was three times.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.346
You're right.

04:19.389 --> 04:22.479
I am a steel trap, usually.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.873
I'll catch up.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.789
Macy, how long
has this been happening?

04:27.832 --> 04:29.138
These memory lapses, huh?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.359
I'm really not sure.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.838
Hmm. Well, if it happens again,

04:33.882 --> 04:35.536
if anything strange happens,
use this,

04:35.579 --> 04:37.277
summon me immediately.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.149
Thanks.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.676
I can't believe it.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.287
Fiona's alive?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.853
Pretty mind-blowing, right?

04:48.897 --> 04:50.855
We wanted to tell you
right away, but Charity's been

04:50.899 --> 04:53.945
hovering nonstop since
she found out about your,

04:53.989 --> 04:55.947
you know, inner demon.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.167
Well, we have to tell her.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.258
Fiona's her sister.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.781
And Harry.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.783
We promised Fiona
we wouldn't tell anyone.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.785
Charity deserves to know.
It's not her fault

05:07.829 --> 05:10.048
the Elders imprisoned her sister
behind her back.Macy,

05:10.092 --> 05:11.963
Charity is an Elder loyalist.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.965
She puts that above
everything else.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.054
Maybe she even put that
above her own sister.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.882
I mean, maybe she did know
that Fiona

05:17.926 --> 05:19.101
was in Tartarus, and her grief

05:19.144 --> 05:20.494
is all an act
for Harry's sake.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.669
Yeah, I don't buy that.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.587
I've seen a different side to
her and you have seen it, too.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.371
She's helped us out
time and time again.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.721
She even broke protocol
to get Harry out of Tartarus.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.680
Look, the bottom line is,
Jada took a huge risk

05:32.723 --> 05:34.377
by confiding in me about Fiona.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.772
Yeah, the only reason I know is
because Jada thought I was Mel.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.297
We can't betray Jada or Fiona.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.081
It's not our secret to tell.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.084
Poor Harry.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.697
Macy.

05:49.740 --> 05:50.959
Okay.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.310
Okay.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.269
Fiona's secret is safe with me,
I promise.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.271
♪ Did you promise to save me?

05:59.315 --> 06:00.925
♪ Yeah, yeah.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.363
CHARITY:
Remember how we used to daydream

06:03.406 --> 06:07.410
about binding our powers

06:07.454 --> 06:09.194
and running away together?

06:09.238 --> 06:11.936
That was before
you became an Elder.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.243
Before all the responsibilities.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.249
I miss those days.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.512
You always wanted
more responsibility,

06:22.556 --> 06:24.035
more everything.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.386
♪ You and I are nothing new...

06:26.429 --> 06:31.608
Yeah. Now I know that
that comes... at a cost.

06:31.652 --> 06:35.046
♪ Fade into
the everlasting grace ♪

06:35.090 --> 06:38.572
♪ Before we fade...

06:38.615 --> 06:39.834
You seem preoccupied.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.879
No, no.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.447
Is it Macy?

06:44.491 --> 06:47.972
No, no, no, no. Mm...

06:48.016 --> 06:50.018
It's nothing.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.119
So weird.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.795
I marked myself with this.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.541
Charity,
what are you doing here?

07:34.584 --> 07:36.499
You're upset. What's happened?

07:36.543 --> 07:37.848
I had a vision.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.984
Uh, I burned myself with this.

07:43.027 --> 07:47.031
The way I did it, the way
I held my arm over the flame.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.425
It was deliberate, like I was
trying to send myself a message.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.733
I really think we should
call Elder Bari.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.170
I-I feel like she was
a part of this.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.173
It didn't work.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.915
What didn't work?

08:00.958 --> 08:03.918
I'm having the strongest sense
of déjà vu.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.277
MACY:
What-what happened?

08:16.539 --> 08:19.194
Well, you summoned me
with the compass,

08:19.237 --> 08:22.458
and when I found you, you were
passed out in the attic.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.461
I...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.245
I don't remember summoning you.

08:28.899 --> 08:31.162
I don't remember any of that.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.166
That's not good.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.308
CHARITY:
I'm not positive, but...

08:46.351 --> 08:49.354
the self-harming could be
a demonic symptom.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.055
And you have no memory
of how you acquired the burns?

08:54.098 --> 08:56.274
None. What is happening to me?

08:56.318 --> 08:58.189
Macy, breathe.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.756
Harry, see if you can

08:59.800 --> 09:00.801
heal the marks.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.238
Of course.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.247
There.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.683
Thanks.That's a good sign.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.294
Yeah.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.948
But if my demon-ness
is burning me from the inside,

09:17.992 --> 09:19.210
it's just gonna keep happening.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.298
Macy, we don't know that.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.300
I should talk to Dr. Julia.

09:22.344 --> 09:23.911
She might be able to help.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.390
Alistair's wife?

09:25.434 --> 09:26.783
Ex-wife.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.742
She's on our side, Charity.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.700
Absolutely not.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.920
We can't let a mortal
with demon connections

09:32.963 --> 09:35.183
anywhere near this situation.
It's far too dangerous.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.924
We should go.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.795
Let her get some rest.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.450
HARRY:
We'll leave you in peace.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.501
Charity.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.112
I don't understand.

09:51.155 --> 09:54.115
Where is Elder Bari
with these test results?

09:54.158 --> 09:56.291
I really need to know
what's going on with me.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.945
Can-can I have her number?

09:57.988 --> 10:00.251
I-I'll reach out myself.Macy, it's all right.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.166
I'll handle it.
I will track her down.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.428
Well, I'll come with.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.169
I'm worried something
is seriously wrong.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.910
If you could just take
me to Elder Bari...

10:06.954 --> 10:09.347
Macy.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.914
Listen.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.264
Sit. It's safer

10:13.308 --> 10:14.918
if you stay put, rest.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.965
We don't know how stress
could affect your situation.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.663
You said "safer."

10:20.707 --> 10:23.710
Am I a danger to anyone?

10:23.753 --> 10:25.320
I will reach out
to Priyanka again,

10:25.363 --> 10:27.409
see if we can
expedite the process.

10:27.452 --> 10:30.673
But what you need right now...

10:30.717 --> 10:33.502
is rest.

10:43.425 --> 10:46.036
How worried should we be?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.690
Well, I didn't want
to scare her.
Really?

10:47.734 --> 10:50.040
Because I'm pretty sure
she's terrified.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.259
Mel, I'm trying to help.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.652
Protocol would have me
bring this matter

10:52.695 --> 10:54.218
directly to the other Elders.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.916
Would you rather I do that?No.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.876
Anything we can do
to help, we're here.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.010
Thank you.
Now, I must warn you,

11:03.053 --> 11:06.274
if this is related
to her darkness,

11:06.317 --> 11:07.841
she might start
acting strangely.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.756
Well, should we stay with her?

11:09.799 --> 11:11.714
No, it's all right. Harry and I
are here; we've got it.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.325
She'll be fine.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.110
Okay.
Okay.

11:22.333 --> 11:26.381
Harry... I'm scared.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.774
Come here.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.086
I'll stay with Macy.No, no.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.958
No, no, I will.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.221
Um, but listen, Harry,
there's something else

11:40.264 --> 11:42.571
that I didn't mention
in front of the girls.

11:43.659 --> 11:47.924
Macy has been obsessing
about Elder Bari

11:47.968 --> 11:49.360
and these test results.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.102
Well, understandably so.

11:52.146 --> 11:55.366
Yes, but she said something
that gave me the impression

11:55.410 --> 11:58.021
that she might have tried to
contact Priyanka on her own.

11:58.065 --> 12:02.112
What?It's just not like Priyanka
to go AWOL like this.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.853
I'm afraid something
might be wrong.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.202
I'll try and track down
Priyanka now.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.422
Thank you.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.079
Oh...

12:12.122 --> 12:14.516
I figured out what had you
so preoccupied last night.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.867
Fiona.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.695
The anniversary
of her death.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.224
Ten years yesterday.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.400
If she could see you now,
what an inspiration you are

12:29.444 --> 12:32.099
to these young women,
she'd be very proud.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.363
Thank you, Harry.

12:38.801 --> 12:39.802
PARKER:
What does this mean?

12:39.846 --> 12:42.500
The triple helix of your human

12:42.544 --> 12:45.460
and demonic DNA
is stabilizing.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.941
Mom, English, please.

12:50.334 --> 12:53.860
The serum is weakening
your demonic side.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.296
You're getting better.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.733
PARKER: We're not out of the woods yet.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.605
But you're getting better.
That's worth celebrating.

13:00.649 --> 13:04.566
You're lucky your mom's
a science genius.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.395
I mean, you're also unlucky
your dad's a demon, but...

13:07.438 --> 13:09.353
Yeah.
I'm an optimist.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.573
Just one of the things
I love about you.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.318
Here you go.Thank you.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.626
MAGGIE:
Is it just me,
or is Lucy everywhere lately?

13:21.670 --> 13:24.629
Yeah. Looks like she's wrapped
up in her phone on something.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.066
Maybe she won't
notice us.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.415
She's a great friend,

13:27.458 --> 13:29.156
but it's never not gonna
be awkward.

13:29.199 --> 13:32.637
So, awkward it is.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.640
What's up, brunchers?

13:35.684 --> 13:36.772
Is anyone sitting here?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.165
We're actually kind of
on a date.
No.

13:38.208 --> 13:42.212
Clutch. So, Mags, how's
the video collage coming?

13:42.256 --> 13:43.518
Can I get a sneak peek?

13:43.561 --> 13:45.781
Yeah, it's, um--

13:45.825 --> 13:47.087
it's a work in progress.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.395
Why is Macy so anti?

13:51.439 --> 13:54.616
If I looked like her,
I'd be Insta-storying 24/7.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.488
Don't you already do that?Yeah.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.968
Touché, Parkerita, touché.

13:59.012 --> 14:03.581
Ooh, Bellinis on me. BRB.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.760
We're really doing this now?I'm sorry.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.545
It's just, I'm finally
rushing Kappa again,

14:10.588 --> 14:11.894
and I want to stay
on her good side.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.508
Is it done?

14:17.552 --> 14:19.554
I'm on it.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.687
There you are.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.391
Bellinis for Parkerita.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.003
Parker.
MAGGIE:
Oh.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.745
Mags.Thanks, Lucy.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.923
Slainte.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.229
Oh.

14:42.272 --> 14:43.708
Slain... te.
Slainte.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.710
Slainte.
Slainte.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.584
Whew.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.915
How odd.
It seems they spoke.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.529
BARI:
To see what I need you to see,

15:21.572 --> 15:23.226
you'll need a little

15:23.270 --> 15:24.575
booster shot.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.542
Oh, God, this can't be.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.602
MACY:
Harry!

15:54.170 --> 15:56.520
Macy, you called me?

16:00.916 --> 16:02.222
What is it?

16:16.279 --> 16:18.890
I think I killed her.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.682
I don't know how this trunk
just got here,

16:27.725 --> 16:29.205
but it looks like she's been
dead for days.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.381
It certainly smells
like it.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.122
I just can't believe this.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.865
Do you really think
I killed her?

16:36.908 --> 16:38.214
Certainly not.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.042
HARRY:
There must be some
other explanation.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.261
I don't know.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.219
Even if you did,
you remember her

16:43.263 --> 16:44.525
coming at you with a needle.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.744
You thought you had
to defend yourself, clearly.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.181
Why can't I remember
what happened?

16:48.224 --> 16:50.966
We will sort this out,
but you must remain calm.

16:51.010 --> 16:56.885
The visions, the blacking out...
all the lost time.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.974
Is it my human side
blocking out what I did

16:59.018 --> 17:00.193
'cause it's too painful?

17:00.236 --> 17:02.282
Will I even have
a human side much longer?

17:02.325 --> 17:03.892
Macy...
It's too much.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.155
What if I killed someone?

17:06.199 --> 17:08.114
Macy, breathe.

17:12.466 --> 17:15.860
Is there something
we can do...

17:15.904 --> 17:17.210
to contain me?

17:21.779 --> 17:23.694
There is.
What is it?

17:26.784 --> 17:30.223
Well...

17:30.266 --> 17:31.659
we could bind your powers.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.182
No, absolutely not.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.054
It's out of the question.I know it's an extreme step,

17:35.097 --> 17:37.230
but it may be the best way
to get a handle on

17:37.273 --> 17:38.622
what we're dealing with here.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.972
I'm no good fighting
evil if I am evil.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.410
It'll only be temporary.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.412
Macy, trust me,
this can work.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.022
HARRY:
You can't guarantee that.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.328
This is uncharted territory.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.069
Binding a Charmed One
is far too dangerous.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.374
CHARITY:
It's the only way.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.202
I'm sorry, I-I can't think
of any other options.

17:53.246 --> 17:56.118
But we must find one.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.163
If we bind you,

17:57.206 --> 17:59.034
we risk losing

17:59.078 --> 18:01.732
the Power of Three forever.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.345
I understand.

18:07.303 --> 18:10.524
I don't want that.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.355
I'm just scared of
what I'm capable of.

18:19.402 --> 18:22.797
Can I just talk to
my sisters first?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.147
This, um-- this
affects them, too.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
Yes.
Of course.

18:27.193 --> 18:30.413
Meanwhile, I'll handle
Elder Bari.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.200
Right.

18:38.595 --> 18:41.032
We'll find another way.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.686
We must seek counsel
with the other Elders.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.341
I already have,
and they agree.

18:45.385 --> 18:49.345
Harry, a Charmed One
overtaken by evil

18:49.389 --> 18:51.173
is far more dangerous
than anything

18:51.217 --> 18:52.174
predicted in the Prophecy.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.741
You know as well as I do

18:53.784 --> 18:57.266
that this may be the best way
to save Macy from herself.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.195
Hey. No more oversleeping?

19:13.239 --> 19:17.112
No. I called in sick,
though, again.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.201
Oh, you're lucky
you have a boss

19:19.245 --> 19:21.334
who already knows you're
a witch with a demon side.

19:22.726 --> 19:27.209
Huh, I am freakishly
optimistic, aren't I?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.690
I thought I heard you
get up last night.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.213
What's going on?

19:31.257 --> 19:33.781
I couldn't sleep.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.698
And I need to talk to you both.

19:37.741 --> 19:40.918
Charity thinks
it could work.

19:40.962 --> 19:44.052
And it seems to be
the only option...

19:44.095 --> 19:45.227
to stop me...

19:45.271 --> 19:47.490
from what I might do.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.234
♪ I wanna...

19:52.278 --> 19:53.409
So what do you think?

19:54.280 --> 19:57.239
If your powers are bound,

19:57.283 --> 20:00.111
then there's no Power of Three.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.678
I know, but if I killed
Elder Bari...

20:01.722 --> 20:03.463
"If."

20:03.506 --> 20:04.681
That's a big if.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.205
If your powers are bound

20:06.248 --> 20:08.250
and we aren't
the Charmed Ones anymore,

20:08.294 --> 20:10.078
what does that mean
for the world?

20:10.121 --> 20:11.471
The apocalypse?

20:11.514 --> 20:14.343
I don't know.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.780
But if I'm evil, I can't help
you stop the apocalypse.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.782
We don't know if you're evil.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.742
Maybe we don't even
have to decide now.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.135
That's easy for you to say.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.313
Sorry, Maggie.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.966
♪ Dressed in...

20:29.010 --> 20:30.577
I think I'm...

20:30.620 --> 20:32.796
I need to be alone.

20:32.840 --> 20:37.279
♪ All through the night

20:39.238 --> 20:42.328
♪ Wake up to raise the...

20:42.371 --> 20:44.286
There has to be
another way.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.376
This doesn't feel right.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.335
We can't let Macy
bind her powers.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.597
Maybe Dr. Julia
can help.

20:51.989 --> 20:54.383
I know we're not supposed
to talk to her, but...

20:54.427 --> 20:56.385
she's an expert in
the field of demons

20:56.429 --> 20:57.952
and a freaking genius.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.389
Maybe there's
something she can do.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.043
Look at you going against

21:02.086 --> 21:03.479
Charity's explicit
instructions.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.265
I am so proud.
Let's go.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.075
MAN:
Parker, dude, are you okay?

21:34.118 --> 21:35.119
Hey, Parker.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.782
So what do we do?

21:45.826 --> 21:47.567
The visions, the memory loss.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.743
Do you think this is
her demon side taking over?

21:49.786 --> 21:51.614
I can't say for sure.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.573
Especially with so little
information to go on.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.575
Wait.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.359
What about those weird burns?

21:57.403 --> 21:59.579
Harry healed those.
They're gone.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.626
Hold up, my-my video collage.

22:05.454 --> 22:06.629
She had these
marks on her arm

22:06.673 --> 22:08.327
and didn't remember
getting them.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.893
MEL:
Charity said

22:09.937 --> 22:11.852
self-harm is like a...
demonic symptom.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.463
Oh, I can't say I've ever heard
of a demon self-harming.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.378
Really?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.206
Demons?

22:18.249 --> 22:21.470
Self-harming?

22:21.514 --> 22:25.169
They are utterly lacking in
conscience and self-reflection.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.350
But I should probably leave
my personal baggage out of it.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.528
These look like...

22:35.571 --> 22:37.268
run-of-the-mill burn bruises.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.490
Based on the triangular pattern,

22:41.534 --> 22:44.406
they're probably from
three separate candle flames,

22:44.450 --> 22:46.713
but I would have to examine them
myself to be sure.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.758
Well, no one can
examine them now.

22:48.802 --> 22:52.283
Because Charity asked Harry
to heal them.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.678
MAGGIE:
What are you saying?

22:55.722 --> 22:57.027
I don't know.

22:57.071 --> 23:00.640
All I do know is
that this binding of Macy?

23:00.683 --> 23:02.206
It isn't gonna happen.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.193
Oh, wait.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.851
This, this, I...

23:39.548 --> 23:41.985
I burned myself with this.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.644
To help me remember.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.391
Oh, my God.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.926
MEL:
Charity's been watching
Macy like a hawk.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.493
Because she's worried
about her.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.147
That's what she claims.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.844
It is weird.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.629
She didn't want us
talking to Dr. Julia.

24:16.672 --> 24:19.501
What if Charity's been
lying to us this whole time?

24:19.545 --> 24:21.068
Manipulating Macy,
gaslighting her

24:21.111 --> 24:23.287
to make her think
her demon side is taking over.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.767
But why?

24:24.811 --> 24:26.943
It doesn't add up.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.597
Well-- hold up,

24:28.641 --> 24:29.772
these shoes aren't
meant for hurrying.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.295
I just have
this feeling

24:31.339 --> 24:32.993
that Charity's been
playing all of us.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.823
Oh, God.
We need to find Macy.

24:36.866 --> 24:39.608
Text her. Tell her to
stay away from Charity

24:39.652 --> 24:41.305
and that we'll
be there ASAP.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.351
And Harry,
we need Harry.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.021
BARI:
Macy.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.631
It's Charity.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.287
Charity killed our mother.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.340
Oh...
CHARITY:
Macy.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.604
You s-stay away from me.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.520
There are factors at play
that you can't

25:21.563 --> 25:23.870
possibly understand.

25:25.741 --> 25:28.614
You killed my mother.It's okay.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.529
You won't remember a thing.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.497
Don't be afraid.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.159
Oh...

25:57.381 --> 25:59.035
It was you.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.777
If you'd only
just left it alone.

26:04.911 --> 26:07.304
Dormi cito.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.881
Harry!

26:21.057 --> 26:23.582
Help!He can't hear you.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.932
I've severed his connection
to you and your sisters.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.281
What?

26:31.764 --> 26:34.288
Macy, do you remember
when we first met?

26:34.331 --> 26:36.856
How we understood
each other right away?

26:36.899 --> 26:38.814
That connection...

26:38.858 --> 26:41.469
was real.None of it was real.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.297
You killed my mother.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.175
That was a mistake.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.483
I tried to wipe your memory.

26:55.526 --> 26:58.051
To rid you of everything
that you saw

26:58.094 --> 27:00.314
with Bari's needle, then...

27:00.357 --> 27:01.968
all this could go away

27:02.011 --> 27:04.666
and we could just continue on
as before-- that's all

27:04.710 --> 27:07.060
I ever wanted-- but because
you're a Charmed One,

27:07.103 --> 27:09.279
the memories
kept breaking through.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.630
So the new plan was
to bind your powers,

27:11.673 --> 27:13.283
just temporarily,

27:13.327 --> 27:16.809
allowing me to destroy
those memories forever.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.772
But you figured it out...

27:23.816 --> 27:26.079
before I could make it happen.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.646
Oh, Macy.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.649
I'm genuinely
fond of you.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.172
I don't want
to have to kill you.

27:32.215 --> 27:35.871
Charity?You have left me no choice.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.443
Macy, where are you?Mace?

27:42.486 --> 27:44.793
Still no response
to my text.

is Harry? Harry!

27:52.105 --> 27:53.933

27:53.976 --> 27:56.022

28:06.162 --> 28:08.338

28:09.426 --> 28:11.472

Macy, where are you?

28:11.515 --> 28:12.734
I'm getting a
really bad feeling.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.128
Me, too. Where did
she pass out last time

28:15.171 --> 28:17.130
when Charity found her?The attic.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.175

28:19.219 --> 28:20.829
MEL: Where are you?MAGGIE: Harry!

Macy!

28:22.657 --> 28:24.441
She's alive. I can prove it.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.747
She didn't
kill herself.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.793
She's been in Tartarus
the whole time.

28:27.836 --> 28:30.012
The Elders
sent her there.I don't believe you.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.579
It's true.
The Elders lied to you.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.668
My sisters have
seen Fiona.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.062
She's with the Sarcana, I...

28:36.105 --> 28:37.890
I can take you to her.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.848
God, Mel,
where are they?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.199
MEL:
Charity's compass.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.680
They were here.
If we can't
find Charity,

28:45.724 --> 28:47.421
let's get this bitch
to come to us.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.817
Why isn't this working?

28:51.860 --> 28:53.775
Ah, good. You're both here.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.037
Harry, where the hell
have you been?

28:55.081 --> 28:57.692
We've been trying
to call you.
You have?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.520
But I didn't hear...Charity wants to bind
Macy's powers,

28:59.563 --> 29:01.087
but we can't let that happen.I know.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.131
It's why I've been
looking for you both.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.742
We think Charity's
been lying to us.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.656
We just don't know why,
but we think she took Macy.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.832
Wait. What are
you talking about?

29:06.875 --> 29:08.747
We just need you
to summon her.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.619
But this isn't working.Well, this isn't
her summoning compass.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.143
It's a surveillance device.

29:14.187 --> 29:17.277
She's been keeping
tabs on Macy.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.800
We need to find her.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.759
Charity can portal.
They could be anywhere.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.152
But she'd take her to a place
we couldn't get to, right?Yes.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.850
A place she told us
not to go.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.939
The Vortex Viribus.The vortex under the house.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.375

have to do this.

the inevitable.

Are you okay?

29:36.818 --> 29:37.776
Harry.

29:37.819 --> 29:38.994

29:39.038 --> 29:40.256

Ah!

30:35.877 --> 30:38.010
Harry, help me.

30:39.054 --> 30:41.665

30:48.890 --> 30:51.458
Oh, God, my powers.

30:51.501 --> 30:52.981
My powers, they're gone.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.909

31:07.953 --> 31:10.085
Exactly how
Mom died?

31:12.958 --> 31:16.222
Yeah.
I saw it all.

31:19.007 --> 31:22.793
Can you... can
you show us?

31:22.837 --> 31:25.796
I can try.

Are you sure?

31:28.974 --> 31:30.976
Yeah.Yeah.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.805

32:14.758 --> 32:17.500
Marisol, what
are you doing?

32:17.544 --> 32:19.328
That was an
unbinding spell.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.982
Are you spying on me?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.245
Your recent closeness
with the Sarcana

32:23.289 --> 32:24.594
concerned me.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.466
And have you shared your
concerns with the Elders?

32:26.509 --> 32:28.729
After what the Sarcana
did to my sister,

32:28.772 --> 32:31.297
can you blame me for
being worried about you?

32:31.340 --> 32:35.301
You said "I have three."
What did you mean?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.783
I have a secret.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.525
And as my friend, I'm trusting
that you'll keep it.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.875
Tell me.

32:44.919 --> 32:47.487
My first baby died.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.923
I don't understand.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.796
I brought her back.
With necromancy.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.409
Necromancy is the darkest
of dark magic.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.933
A witch brought back
from the dead

32:58.977 --> 32:59.934

32:59.978 --> 33:01.675
But she's not just
any witch.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.678

and the gift of prophecy.

I know that it's them.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.380
A Charmed One touched by evil?
It cannot be.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.773
You're wrong.

33:12.816 --> 33:15.254
There's no evil in her.
Macy is good.
