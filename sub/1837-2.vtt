00:06.200 --> 00:07.767
Oh, hey, how
you doing?
What's up?

00:07.767 --> 00:09.400
Check it out.
What do you think?

00:09.400 --> 00:10.700
You know what, Eddie?

00:10.700 --> 00:12.367
I like it, 'cause it takes
a lot of confidence

00:12.367 --> 00:13.367
to rock a man purse.

00:13.367 --> 00:14.567
No, it's not a man purse.

00:14.567 --> 00:16.400
It's actually
a cute little invitation

00:16.400 --> 00:17.834
to Alana's Halloween party.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.133
You got invited

00:19.133 --> 00:20.800
to her party?

00:20.800 --> 00:23.233
Oh, just once I would like to
see what all the hype is about.

00:23.233 --> 00:25.200
That is always
the hottest party of the year.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.367
Well, since I'm in, I'm sure

00:26.367 --> 00:27.734
you'll be getting
your pumpkins, too.

00:27.734 --> 00:29.300
Mm-mm, no.
Let me tell you why.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.734
'Cause Alana's hated me
since the fourth grade.

00:31.734 --> 00:32.767
And by association,

00:32.767 --> 00:33.934
my girl chill.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.000
Sorry about that,
girl.
It's all right.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.300
So how did Eddie
get invited?

00:36.300 --> 00:38.100
Brother's got connections.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.900
Hey, Loca.
Muffy.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.100
Alana, thanks
for the invite.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.400
Oh, FYI-- Raven and I

00:46.400 --> 00:48.133
haven't quite received
our invitations yet.

00:48.133 --> 00:51.133
Muffy,
is she talking to me?

00:51.133 --> 00:54.400
Alana feels that if you have
something to say, don't.

00:55.967 --> 00:57.100
Listen, Alana.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.700
We wouldn't want
to come to your party

00:58.700 --> 01:00.500
even you begged us.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.400
Or asked us nicely.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.200
I mean, you can give us a little
winky-wink between girls.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.867
Dad, you know that Chelsea and I
aren't invited to this party.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.367
I thought the whole school
was invited.

02:49.367 --> 02:51.400
Everybody's walking around

No, it's okay. Go ahead.

cashed the check.

Chelsea,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.800
you know Alana
picked my dad's place

03:14.800 --> 03:16.400
just to spite us.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.600
Mmm, I don't know.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.000
I think she might have
picked this place

03:19.000 --> 03:20.600

03:21.600 --> 03:23.200
This vegi-burger is seriously

Okay, well...
check this out
real quick.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.133
We got to say
the magic words.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.500
Uh...
Duh!

08:29.500 --> 08:30.667
Nuh.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.000
Please and thank you.

08:34.867 --> 08:37.000
"Please and thank you"?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.200
From the book!

08:38.200 --> 08:40.133
Magic words.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.367
"Bubble and boil,
o magic stew,

08:44.367 --> 08:47.000
make our special
wish come true."

08:47.000 --> 08:48.934
(<i>deep rumble </i>)
Oh!

08:51.600 --> 08:53.667
(<i>phone ringing </i>)

08:54.400 --> 08:57.467
(<i>potion bubbling </i>)

08:57.467 --> 08:59.467
Baxter residence.

08:59.467 --> 09:00.834
ALANA:
Raven...

09:00.834 --> 09:01.834
it's Alana.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.000
I don't know why
I'm saying this,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.900
but I want to invite you
and Chelsea to my party.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.300
(<i>gasping </i>):
We... We're invited!

09:09.300 --> 09:10.667
We're invited
to the party?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.200
Uh, yes.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.467
But if Alana weren't
in a weird trance-like
state right now,

09:15.467 --> 09:16.767
she'd probably do this:

09:16.767 --> 09:17.800
(<i>phone beeps </i>)

09:20.300 --> 09:22.200
The spell--
I think it worked.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.567
Oh, gr-gr-great.
Let's make another wish.

09:24.567 --> 09:25.800
Come on, come on!

09:26.800 --> 09:30.967
We want to be the
most popular girls

09:30.967 --> 09:32.000
at the party.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.200
Yes, yes.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.100
Oh, and have
the best costumes.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.133
Yes, yes!

09:37.133 --> 09:40.467
And we want all eyes
to be on us.

09:40.467 --> 09:41.567
Yes.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.700
BOTH:
"Bubble and boil, o magic stew,

09:44.700 --> 09:46.500
make our special wish
come true!"

09:46.500 --> 09:47.500
(<i>rumble </i>)

09:47.500 --> 09:48.600
(<i>both squealing </i>)

09:48.600 --> 09:49.967
(<i>laughing </i>)

09:51.834 --> 09:53.367
(<i>both squealing </i>)

09:56.567 --> 09:57.900
Oh, thank you so much.

09:57.900 --> 09:58.934
We got to get
some costumes.

09:58.934 --> 09:59.867
Oh, you're right.
Costumes.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.033
(<i>potion bubbling </i>)

10:13.967 --> 10:15.467
Chelse...

10:15.467 --> 10:17.233
who am I?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.500
The Queen of...

10:22.500 --> 10:24.834
Flannel.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.867
Hearts, Chelse.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.233
The Queen of Hearts.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.200
Okay, but Rae,
if I don't get it,

10:30.200 --> 10:31.400
hello-- no one will.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.834
(<i>laughs </i>)

10:34.834 --> 10:37.300
Ooh, Rae, let's find me
a costume now.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.900
Okay.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.767
Rae,
what are you wearing?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.100
Are those cow ears?

10:45.767 --> 10:48.367
That is so like you,
holding out on the good costume.

10:48.367 --> 10:49.734
What?

10:50.567 --> 10:52.567
(<i>screaming </i>)

10:52.567 --> 10:53.867
(<i>laughing </i>)

10:53.867 --> 10:56.300
I have cow ears!
I have cow ears!

10:56.300 --> 10:58.300
How did I get cow ears?

10:58.300 --> 11:00.200
Stop it!

11:01.800 --> 11:03.900
It's not a costume, Chelse!

11:03.900 --> 11:04.867
Oh, Rae, come on!

11:04.867 --> 11:06.000
Like I couldn't pull

11:06.000 --> 11:07.233
those ears off!
(<i>screaming </i>)

11:10.033 --> 11:11.667
Oh, oh, Rae, Rae,
they moved, they moved!

11:11.667 --> 11:12.600
Your cow ears moved!

11:13.500 --> 11:14.600
Oh!

11:16.934 --> 11:18.367
Whoa, how did you do that?

11:18.367 --> 11:20.300
I don't know, Chelse.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.367
I didn't do it.

11:21.367 --> 11:22.233
Ah, they're moving
by themselves.

11:22.233 --> 11:23.300
Chelse, oh, my goodness!

11:23.300 --> 11:24.767
Okay, we have
to calm down!

11:24.767 --> 11:26.000
Yes, yes, you're right!

11:26.000 --> 11:28.300
We have to-to sit down
and think about it!

11:28.300 --> 11:29.300
Yeah, good idea.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.934
Ow!
What?

11:30.934 --> 11:32.200
Gosh, you're sitting
on my tail.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.233
Sorry about that.
It's okay.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.734
Tail?!
Tail?!

11:36.734 --> 11:38.300
(<i>both screaming </i>)

11:50.500 --> 11:52.934
Why... why couldn't I
just get, like, a zit

11:52.934 --> 11:54.133
like everyone else?

11:54.133 --> 11:58.967
Hello. I have
a zit and a tail!

12:05.200 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, Chelsea, I wouldn't worry
about that zit.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.300
(<i>gasps and screams </i>)

12:10.967 --> 12:12.900
Rae, I'm scared.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.400
I know, me, too, but do you know
what I'm really afraid of?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.300
That you have a tail, too?

12:18.300 --> 12:20.000
You know me all too well.

12:22.767 --> 12:23.967
(<i>both crying </i>)

12:23.967 --> 12:25.200
I've got a tail!

12:25.200 --> 12:26.300
Rae, look at our ears!

12:26.300 --> 12:28.300
EDDIE:
Rae, are you up there?

12:28.300 --> 12:30.967
It's Eddie.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.000
What are we going to do?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.600
We can't let him see
us like this.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.200
Yes, right... um...

12:35.200 --> 12:36.400
Eddie, we'll
be right down.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.600
All right,
just move
your tails.

12:43.567 --> 12:44.734
Ew, that's nasty.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.233
That tastes like feet.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.200
Disgusting.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.400
Yeah, that's definitely feet.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.300
Hey, hey, hey,
Eddie, what's up?

12:58.300 --> 13:00.066
Yeah, hey, hey,
how's it going, man?

13:00.066 --> 13:02.200
So, I heard you guys
got invited to Alana's party,

13:02.200 --> 13:04.734
and I thought that maybe
we could all go over together.

13:04.734 --> 13:05.700
Oh, oh.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
Yes.
That's so sweet.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.900
(<i>laughing </i>):
That is so...

13:10.600 --> 13:11.967
Oh... no.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.934
You two are acting
weirder than usual.

13:13.934 --> 13:15.300
Well, it's not 'cause

13:15.300 --> 13:17.800
we've changed or anything
in any way.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.000
I mean, every...
every part of us

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
is exactly as weird
as it has always been.

13:24.834 --> 13:27.000
Oh!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.200
Rae, your tail...

13:28.200 --> 13:29.800
Oh!

13:32.834 --> 13:35.567
You know what, Eddie?

13:35.567 --> 13:36.967
It's the last
minute, man,

13:36.967 --> 13:39.400
and we really got to get
to get our costumes together,

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
so bye-bye.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.900
Wait, wait, wait.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.400
Rae, this book will go great
with my sorcerer's costume.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.967
Oh, okay, well, take it,
it's yours.

13:46.967 --> 13:48.033
Just mo...

13:48.033 --> 13:49.500
(<i>mooing </i>)

13:53.200 --> 13:56.834
Did you just moo?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.500
Me? Moo?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.400
(<i>mooing </i>):
Nooo.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.900
(<i>coughing </i>)

14:04.900 --> 14:06.867
Whatever. I'll
see y'all later.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.000
Okay.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.000
Oh, Chelsea, we really
got to fix something.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.100
We did something horrible
with that spell.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.734
I know, but maybe, maybe
we put in the wrong ingredients.

14:15.734 --> 14:17.700
Well, check it out, girl,
before I moo again.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.000
Okay, um, um...

14:19.000 --> 14:21.200
we were... we were making,
you know, wishing

14:21.200 --> 14:22.300
for a bunch of stuff,

14:22.300 --> 14:24.700
and, um... and...

14:24.700 --> 14:26.367
Oh, no.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.300
Funny story.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.834
This must have
fallen in when we
were making our wishes.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.400
(<i>laughing </i>)

14:40.000 --> 14:42.934
You wished we were cows?

14:42.934 --> 14:44.500
Why couldn't you

14:44.500 --> 14:47.300
have been wearing
a Halle Berry button?

14:47.300 --> 14:48.734
Oh, oh, oh, I know,
I know.

14:48.734 --> 14:50.467
Maybe if we check the book,
we can find a spell

14:50.467 --> 14:51.467
to undo the spell.

14:51.467 --> 14:54.200
A spell check--
good thinking.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.734
Yeah, good, good, good...

14:55.734 --> 14:57.000
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.800
Eddie has
taken the book.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.300
No, we are definitely doo...

15:00.300 --> 15:03.300
(<i>mooing </i>):
doomed.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.900
We're not doomed now,
Chelsea, okay?

15:05.900 --> 15:08.467
We just got to go
to Alana's party

15:08.467 --> 15:10.133
and get the book back.

15:10.133 --> 15:11.667
Okay, Rae, hello.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.000
We cannot walk into a room full
of people looking like cows.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.467
We can on Halloween.

15:16.467 --> 15:19.300
(<i>mooing </i>):
Truuue!

15:22.100 --> 15:25.734
(<i>car alarm blaring </i>)

15:28.200 --> 15:31.400
This was the worst
Halloween ever.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.233
Your costume set off
every car alarm

15:35.233 --> 15:37.767
and home security system
in the neighborhood.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.734
I wanted to rewire,

15:39.734 --> 15:45.300
but no, you couldn't wait
to get your precious candy.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.867
What candy?

15:47.867 --> 15:50.400
Look what we got.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.900
A stupid pack
of breath mints.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.900
And three pennies.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.567
They threw those at us.

15:58.567 --> 15:59.867
(<i>door opens </i>)

15:59.867 --> 16:03.734
(<i>car alarm blaring </i>)

16:03.734 --> 16:07.467
Make the noise
stop, master.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.700
Thank you.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.200
(<i>evil laughter </i>)

16:11.200 --> 16:13.667
Success!

16:13.667 --> 16:15.867
Success!

16:15.867 --> 16:18.000
Oh, snap!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.800
Uh-uh-uh.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.367
What uh-uh-uh?

16:21.367 --> 16:23.000
That's your father's candy.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.734
You have to ask
permission.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.000
Dad?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.100
Well, looks like you two
did have a rough night.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.300
Go for it.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.567
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

16:34.734 --> 16:36.667
Is something wrong

16:36.667 --> 16:37.900
with the candy?

16:37.900 --> 16:41.400
No. It just doesn't
taste as sweet.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.967
Maybe because you didn't get it
with your father.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.133
COREY:
No.

16:45.133 --> 16:47.300
It's sugar-free.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.500
But, Dad...

16:55.500 --> 16:58.200
I did miss trick-or-treating
with you.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.400
I'm sorry.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.300
Can we do it next year?

17:01.300 --> 17:03.400
Next year?

17:03.400 --> 17:05.500
With all that candy
still out there?

17:06.467 --> 17:07.600
Come on.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.100
Come on, William.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.100
Really?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.567
Just don't touch yourself.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.934
(<i>rhythm and blues playing </i>)

17:28.600 --> 17:30.467
Hey, ho!

17:30.467 --> 17:31.934
Hey, ho!

17:31.934 --> 17:35.767
Hey, ho! Hey...

17:36.400 --> 17:37.600
No!
No!

17:40.467 --> 17:41.500
(<i>screams </i>)

17:41.500 --> 17:45.000
Our noses...
Our noses...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.100
Actually, Rae, technically
they're called snouts.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.600
Whatever!

17:48.600 --> 17:50.133
It's getting worse.

17:50.133 --> 17:51.300
We've got to find Eddie

17:51.300 --> 17:52.600
and get that spell.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.867
Yeah, you're right.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.600
Hey, Chelse...

17:59.600 --> 18:01.700
(<i>noisy chewing </i>)

18:04.934 --> 18:06.767
Chelse!

18:08.400 --> 18:10.033
Listen to me.

18:10.033 --> 18:11.800
You are not a cow.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.934
You are a human being.

18:13.934 --> 18:16.400
Yeah, I know, but Rae,
that was some good hat.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.500
Listen, let's just
get some refreshments

18:18.500 --> 18:20.567
while we wait for Eddie,
all right?

18:28.767 --> 18:31.400
I have hooves!

18:31.400 --> 18:32.300
Chelsea!

18:32.300 --> 18:34.467
(<i>noisy slurping </i>)

18:37.367 --> 18:39.500
Oh, sorry, Rae.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.567
Just needed something
to wash down that hat.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.100
Where'd you get that gum?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.734
It's not gum.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.000
It's cud.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.300
Ew!
Ew!

18:58.300 --> 19:01.600
(<i>both mooing </i>)

19:01.600 --> 19:02.934
Oh, Eddie! Eddie!

19:02.934 --> 19:04.300
We need that book!

19:04.300 --> 19:06.100
Hurry up and
find the spell.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.367
Okay, hold
on, Rae.

19:07.367 --> 19:10.800
I only have two hooves.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.200
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.867
Let me guess--
you two are cows.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.133
That's slick.

19:15.133 --> 19:16.100
It's...

19:16.100 --> 19:17.500
(<i>mooing </i>):
truuue.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.967
We really are cows.

19:18.967 --> 19:20.967
Hey, get out of here.

19:20.967 --> 19:22.834
Did you find it?

19:22.834 --> 19:24.600
Mm-hmm.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.600
Mm-mm.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.667
And it's...

19:26.667 --> 19:28.834
(<i>mooing </i>):
goooood.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.100
People...

19:30.100 --> 19:32.033
may I have
your attention please?

19:32.033 --> 19:33.734
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

19:33.734 --> 19:36.400
♪ Ooh, yeah... ♪

19:36.400 --> 19:38.100
Yo, cut the noise!

19:38.100 --> 19:40.233
(<i>record needle scratching </i>)

19:40.233 --> 19:42.500
Thank you.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.300
(<i>mooing </i>)

19:50.667 --> 19:54.867
Okay, it's time for the results
of the costume contest.

19:54.867 --> 19:58.000
So before we announce
who won first place,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.967
which we all know
will be Alana--

19:59.967 --> 20:02.767
just for giggles--

20:02.767 --> 20:06.367
let's see who came in second.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.100
Alana?

20:11.100 --> 20:13.967
(<i>gasps </i>)

20:13.967 --> 20:15.400
What?! Impossible!

20:15.400 --> 20:16.834
This is my party!

20:16.834 --> 20:17.867
I always win!

20:17.867 --> 20:19.867
<i>No puede ser.</i>
<i>iDejame ver esto!</i>

20:19.867 --> 20:23.300
Alana is super-angry
in Spanish.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.367
Well, if I'm second...

20:26.367 --> 20:28.233
then who's first?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.700
Raven and Chelsea?!

20:31.700 --> 20:33.100
(<i>applause </i>)

20:42.200 --> 20:44.200
Well, we got our wish.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.133
Yep. All eyes are on us.

20:47.133 --> 20:49.767
Might as well milk it.

20:51.233 --> 20:54.400
(<i>both mooing </i>)

20:59.834 --> 21:01.600
No! Don't eat that.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.834
I just had a vision.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.367
Okay, save it, Rae,
I'm hungry.

21:04.367 --> 21:05.400
No, no, no, no.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.834
It's meat.

21:06.834 --> 21:07.934
My dad accidentally

21:07.934 --> 21:09.767
switched the burgers.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.734
Whoa.

21:11.734 --> 21:14.200
Man, do you know
what would have happened

21:14.200 --> 21:15.300
if I'd eaten that?

21:15.300 --> 21:16.800
Actually, yes, Chelse, okay?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.033
It was in my vision.

21:18.033 --> 21:20.233
We had ears and tails
and snouts and m-m-m....

21:20.233 --> 21:22.100
Rae, Rae, Rae,

21:22.100 --> 21:23.500
Rae, Rae, relax, okay?

21:23.500 --> 21:25.600
I didn't actually eat it.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.667
Man, don't have a cow.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.133
Master...

21:36.133 --> 21:39.233
The house is quiet.

21:39.233 --> 21:40.800
The children

21:40.800 --> 21:43.100
are sleeping.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.934
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

21:45.934 --> 21:49.133
I believe I am.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.867
Candy!
Candy!
