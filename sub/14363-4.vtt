<i>Frankie: Out here in the middle,</i>

00:06.822 --> 00:09.257
<i>there are a lot of two-job families.</i>

00:09.325 --> 00:12.327
<i>In our case, we're about
a four or five-job family.</i>

00:12.394 --> 00:15.630
Okay, you are all booked
to rapid city, south Dakota.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.398
Now, we know you have
a choice in air travel,

00:17.466 --> 00:19.534
so we appreciate you flying with us.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.570
Yes, I know we're the only
carrier that flies there.

00:22.638 --> 00:25.306
Look, it's just something
we gotta say, okay?

00:25.374 --> 00:28.009
<i>Mike and I were like two
ships passing in the night...</i>

00:28.077 --> 00:31.813
<i>Two tired, Rusty, "should
started a college fund" ships.</i>

00:38.387 --> 00:40.989
<i>Yep, our anniversary
was pretty lame, as usual.</i>

00:41.056 --> 00:43.191
<i>We don't normally care all that much,</i>

00:43.259 --> 00:44.592
<i>but it's a lot harder</i>

00:44.660 --> 00:46.427
<i>when you're staring
young love in the face.</i>

00:48.764 --> 00:50.732
Darrin's been carrying me everywhere today.

00:50.799 --> 00:52.600
My feet haven't touched the ground once.

00:52.668 --> 00:54.769
That's because I've
declared it "Sue Heck week."

00:54.837 --> 00:56.104
- For no reason.
- Ah!

00:56.172 --> 00:57.939
- Where to, my love?
- Fro-yo!

00:59.208 --> 00:59.974
Aah!

01:00.042 --> 01:02.043
I'm okay!

01:02.111 --> 01:04.279
Sue: Darrin filled my room with balloons!

01:04.346 --> 01:05.379
Can you believe it?!

<i>[Indistinct talking on television]</i>

01:08.784 --> 01:11.653
Darrin: [Singsong voice] A little warmer...

01:11.720 --> 01:13.388
Warmer...

01:13.455 --> 01:15.490
A little cooler.

01:15.558 --> 01:17.358
Cold...

01:17.426 --> 01:18.693
Now you're freezing.

01:18.761 --> 01:19.894
<i>- A little less freezing.
- [Gasps]</i>

01:21.030 --> 01:22.463
Here.

01:22.531 --> 01:24.432
[Gasps]

01:24.500 --> 01:26.034
Darrin, what is this?

01:26.101 --> 01:27.802
Pioneer galaxy jewelers?

01:27.870 --> 01:29.737
At the mall?!

01:29.805 --> 01:30.972
<i>That place is fancy!</i>

01:31.040 --> 01:32.941
They have a security guard and everything!

01:33.008 --> 01:34.309
Open it.

01:35.177 --> 01:37.111
[Inhales sharply] Oh, my God.

01:37.179 --> 01:38.713
It's a necklace...

01:38.781 --> 01:41.282
With a heart and key...

01:41.350 --> 01:43.585
It's because she holds the key to my heart.

01:43.652 --> 01:45.186
Yeah, Darrin, we get it.

01:47.423 --> 01:48.523
[Sighs]

01:49.770 --> 01:51.537
Dude, like, how many different things

01:51.605 --> 01:53.239
do we have to write checks for?

01:53.306 --> 01:55.141
Why is there even a gas bill? Hmm?

01:55.208 --> 01:57.510
You don't put gas in a
house. It's not a car.

01:57.577 --> 01:59.412
What about water? Why
should we pay for that?

01:59.479 --> 02:01.480
- Stuff falls out of the sky for free.
- Yeah.

02:01.548 --> 02:03.759
They're making money off
God. That's just wrong.

02:03.759 --> 02:05.528
I'm telling you... we're gonna
have to get a couple roommates

02:05.528 --> 02:06.563
if we want to pay off these bills.

02:06.563 --> 02:09.622
A couple? [Scoffs] We need 20.

02:09.689 --> 02:11.023
Wait...

02:11.091 --> 02:12.124
That's a great idea.

02:12.192 --> 02:13.394
That frat house
down the street...

02:13.394 --> 02:16.031
it's the same size as ours,
and they're jammed with people.

02:16.031 --> 02:17.350
That could be us!

02:17.350 --> 02:20.332
If we had 20 people paying rent,
we wouldn't have to pay a dime.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.282
We'd be making money.

02:21.282 --> 02:23.335
Man, I don't want to live
with a bunch of dudes.

02:23.403 --> 02:25.704
So we let dudes and girls in. Hmm?

02:25.772 --> 02:27.840
It'd be like a fraternity and a sorority...

02:29.109 --> 02:30.509
a "fratority."

02:30.577 --> 02:32.511
Oh, hell, yes!

02:32.579 --> 02:33.746
What are we gonna call it?

02:33.814 --> 02:34.966
Well, it should have our names in it.

02:34.966 --> 02:35.650
[Chuckles]

02:35.650 --> 02:37.850
But we need to throw
some Greek letters at it

02:37.918 --> 02:38.951
so people know it's legit.

02:39.019 --> 02:40.152
Hmm. Hmm.

02:40.220 --> 02:40.986
Hmm. Hmm.

02:41.054 --> 02:42.254
[Snap fingers]

02:42.322 --> 02:44.056
I got it. How about this?

02:44.124 --> 02:46.892
Hutch Axl pi.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.360
Everybody loves hutch... mm.

02:48.428 --> 02:50.062
Everybody loves Axl... well...

02:50.130 --> 02:51.897
And you know everybody loves pie.

02:51.965 --> 02:53.966
- Huh?
- Oh.

02:54.034 --> 02:55.634
[Both laugh]

02:55.702 --> 02:57.169
Check, check. Hello? Hello?

02:57.237 --> 02:59.972
You're not trying to face-time
the president again, are you?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.675
No. That's ridiculous. I'm
starting my own podcast.

03:02.742 --> 03:03.976
Hey, that could be fun.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.519
It's for the people who
are interested in fonts.

03:06.587 --> 03:10.056
<i>Oh. Well, why don't you do
that and the president thing</i>

03:10.124 --> 03:11.958
and see who answers first.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.994
Hi. I'm Brick Heck, and this is...

03:15.062 --> 03:16.262
"The FontCast"...

03:16.330 --> 03:17.597
Or "footloose and fontsy free."

03:17.665 --> 03:18.932
Still working on the title.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.034
Feel free to call in with suggestions.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.270
Today's topic is the raging
debate of font versus typeface

03:24.338 --> 03:26.673
and times new Roman's place in all of it.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.712
And then, in our last segment,

03:28.924 --> 03:30.166
we'll get into the issue of kerning,

03:30.357 --> 03:31.837
which, for those of
you who don't know...

03:32.017 --> 03:32.626
[chuckling] As if...

03:32.844 --> 03:34.135
is the spacing between characters.

03:34.519 --> 03:37.588
[Washer lid closes] Now, this is a very
hot topic inside of the font community...

03:39.987 --> 03:42.176
- [Door opens]
- Dad, you've got to kno...

03:42.927 --> 03:43.867
Oh, hi, Sue!

03:43.867 --> 03:45.100
Brad, I just did something so crazy!

03:45.168 --> 03:46.735
You'll never guess what!

03:46.803 --> 03:48.904
[Gasps] You dressed up as the
opposite gender and went out in public?

03:48.972 --> 03:51.240
No, even crazier. I stole Darrin's phone.

03:51.307 --> 03:53.308
[Gasps] Okay, I have two
questions and one comment.

03:53.376 --> 03:54.776
How'd you do it?

03:54.844 --> 03:56.512
<i>J'adore that hoodie.
It makes your eyes pop.</i>

03:56.579 --> 03:58.396
And why'd you steal your boyfriend's phone?

03:58.448 --> 04:01.280
Well, Darrin was being so amazing to me

04:01.280 --> 04:02.514
during the week of Sue

04:02.581 --> 04:04.649
with all the presents, including...

04:04.717 --> 04:06.151
- [Gasps]
- Love!

04:06.218 --> 04:07.419
I know, right?

04:07.486 --> 04:09.788
So now I want to do something nice for him,

04:09.855 --> 04:12.924
so I stole his phone to find
a picture of the two of us,

04:12.992 --> 04:15.193
and I want to get it put... on a blanket.

04:15.261 --> 04:17.762
Oh, my God! You two would
look so cute on a blanket!

04:17.829 --> 04:18.963
[Squealing] I know!

04:19.031 --> 04:21.166
Here. Help me look for a photo.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.034
Uh... No...

04:23.102 --> 04:24.269
Unh-unh...

04:24.336 --> 04:26.271
Ew, my hair looks bad...

04:26.338 --> 04:27.572
Still had braces...

04:27.640 --> 04:29.207
Hold on. Is that angel?

04:29.275 --> 04:32.277
Why does he have a picture
of his ex on his phone?

04:32.344 --> 04:34.012
Oh, Brad, it's fine.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.981
Wait a minute. What is she wearing?

04:37.049 --> 04:40.485
Doesn't that look like the
exact same necklace he gave me?

04:40.553 --> 04:41.586
Oh, my God.

04:41.654 --> 04:43.455
He gave a key to his heart to angel

04:43.522 --> 04:46.524
and then he gave a key to his heart to me?

04:48.639 --> 04:51.207
I thought this was the key to his heart,

04:51.275 --> 04:53.276
but apparently he made duplicates.

04:53.344 --> 04:55.578
Now, Sue, if this is true, it's devastating

04:55.646 --> 04:58.081
and would definitely
destroy your relationship,

04:58.149 --> 04:59.849
but let's not go there yet.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.753
<i>Hey. What are you doing here?</i>

05:03.821 --> 05:05.989
Did you know you have to pay for Wi-Fi?

05:06.056 --> 05:07.157
Yeah. I know.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.225
Well, I didn't 'cause
everything here is free.

05:09.293 --> 05:10.760
[Chuckles] For you, maybe.

05:10.828 --> 05:12.428
And by the way, if you're gonna
be living here next summer,

05:12.496 --> 05:14.030
we're gonna start making you pay for stuff.

05:14.098 --> 05:16.900
Yeah, like you're gonna
follow through on that.

05:16.967 --> 05:18.535
Why are you looking at tables?

05:18.602 --> 05:20.103
Hutch and I got some big plans.

05:20.171 --> 05:22.096
We're trying to class up our place,

05:22.096 --> 05:23.912
but we already hit all the
dumpsters, and they're empty.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.749
Ooh. Let's look on Craigslist.

05:25.944 --> 05:27.097
Scoot.

05:27.178 --> 05:29.279
[Clicks tongue] Let's see. Okay.

05:29.346 --> 05:33.449
Tents, televisions, transgender massage.

05:33.517 --> 05:34.751
Oh, tables.

05:34.818 --> 05:36.963
When are you guys gonna
be done with the computer?

05:37.154 --> 05:38.251
I have to do my FontCast.

05:38.628 --> 05:39.765
The second show is very important.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.158
- My fan is counting on me.
- Axl: Brick, we're busy!

05:42.158 --> 05:44.136
I don't think the world's gonna
miss your nerdcast for one day.

05:44.780 --> 05:45.895
Fine. I'll just run my "best of yesterday,"

05:45.963 --> 05:48.431
but I trust you two will
answer the angry letter.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.943
Okay. Ooh!

05:52.011 --> 05:53.378
What's this? Wow.

05:53.446 --> 05:57.315
A whole dining-room table
with chairs for only $52.

05:57.383 --> 05:59.951
[Chuckling] Yeah. I'm not spending $52.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.653
[Scoffs] This is a steal!

06:01.721 --> 06:04.589
Look... matched set, solid
maple, perfect condition.

06:04.657 --> 06:07.459
That's amazing! I can't
believe it's only 52 bucks.

06:07.527 --> 06:09.528
Aren't you past the age where
you get excited about stuff?

06:09.595 --> 06:10.962
Absolutely, but come on.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.665
Imagine how great that would
look in our dining room.

06:13.733 --> 06:16.301
Oh, it's so pretty.

06:16.369 --> 06:18.437
<i>Now, I know we already
have a dining-room table,</i>

06:18.504 --> 06:20.172
<i>but seriously, if you'd seen the crap</i>

06:20.239 --> 06:21.306
<i>that it's been through...</i>

06:21.374 --> 06:22.808
[Electric knife whirring]

06:23.843 --> 06:24.643
[Whirring stops]

06:30.616 --> 06:31.583
Oh!

06:34.641 --> 06:39.011
<i>Yep, there's a reason why we
always have a tablecloth on it.</i>

06:39.079 --> 06:40.880
And you know how I'm always saying

06:40.948 --> 06:43.282
the dining room is so
dark and claustrophobic?

06:43.350 --> 06:45.017
Sure, let's say I do. [Sighs]

06:45.085 --> 06:46.752
Well, this was maple.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.821
I mean, it would just
lighten the whole room.

06:48.889 --> 06:50.056
It reminds me of something

06:50.123 --> 06:51.824
that would be in that
movie with Diane Keaton,

06:51.892 --> 06:54.160
where she's the writer
and she writes and cries

06:54.227 --> 06:55.661
at that desk with her glasses on.

06:55.729 --> 06:56.662
Oh, you know the movie.

06:56.730 --> 06:57.596
No idea.

06:57.664 --> 06:58.698
Yes, you do.

06:58.765 --> 07:01.000
Anyway, there was this table in that movie,

07:01.068 --> 07:03.102
and they were always laughing around it

07:03.170 --> 07:04.971
and eating on plates with candles,

07:05.038 --> 07:07.606
and the whole house just
seemed so fresh and beachy.

07:07.674 --> 07:10.343
<i>Of course, it was actually at the beach,</i>

07:10.410 --> 07:12.278
so that probably
did... let's get it.

07:12.346 --> 07:15.162
What? What are you talking
about? We're not gonna get it.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.976
Who says? Let...

07:17.144 --> 07:18.275
[scoffs] Let's do it. Why not?

07:18.648 --> 07:19.585
Mike, we're trying to save for college,

07:19.653 --> 07:21.120
and we already have a table.

07:21.188 --> 07:23.589
We'll give it to Axl. It's
already wrecked anyway.

07:23.657 --> 07:24.623
Are you serious?

07:24.691 --> 07:25.658
Yeah, I am.

07:25.726 --> 07:27.226
We've been working our butts off.

07:27.294 --> 07:29.811
It's our 20-something-th anniversary.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.017
And besides, the next time we splurge

07:32.084 --> 07:33.418
on something made of wood,

07:33.486 --> 07:34.920
it'll probably be coffins. Oh!

07:34.987 --> 07:37.389
Come on. It'll be our gift to each other.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.991
[Sighs] But it seems so extravagant.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.127
I mean, can we really do that?

07:42.194 --> 07:44.062
Frankie, you've been
complaining about that table

07:44.130 --> 07:45.297
since the day we got it.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.565
You hate that thing.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.633
Come on, 20-something
years is long enough.

07:48.701 --> 07:49.734
You've done your time.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.536
Really? We're gonna do it?

07:52.538 --> 07:54.039
Oh, my God! We're gonna do it!

07:54.974 --> 07:57.042
Ooh, I got to get that thing.
It's gonna get snatched up.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.251
[Door opens]

08:06.319 --> 08:08.353
Oh, hey. I wanted to call
you, but I can't find my phone.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.788
Yeah, I know. I have it.

08:09.855 --> 08:10.956
Oh, great.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.223
<i>No, not great, Darrin.</i>

08:13.723 --> 08:16.025
I stole it to find a
picture of the two of us

08:16.092 --> 08:18.027
so I could make you a photo blanket

and the universe clearly
does not want us to have it.

17:37.009 --> 17:39.243
I just wanted something nice for a change.

17:39.311 --> 17:42.013
I know. Well, someday we'll learn.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.181

I know. This is so awesome!

17:58.897 --> 18:00.631
How many people did you give bids to?

18:00.699 --> 18:02.466
Uh, I don't know. I just
started letting everybody in.

18:02.534 --> 18:03.434
Me too!

We got to figure out something else.

He's not pink-sweater

And, you know... he's family.

Um, I-I would say that I love you

19:26.456 --> 19:28.258

You really went to town here.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.698
Well, you know, I was thinking about it,

20:36.766 --> 20:41.456
and I realized when I sit down to dinner

20:41.456 --> 20:42.866
at a tiny table,

20:43.260 --> 20:45.261
there's no one I'd rather
