WEBVTT

00:01.571 --> 00:04.038
war in the pacific was his top priority

00:04.040 --> 00:07.287
many historians have argued
that it was actually Roosevelt's

00:07.288 --> 00:11.198
declining health that played
the most significant role at Yalta.

00:11.199 --> 00:13.769
Had he not been in such
failing health, they argue,

00:13.770 --> 00:15.524
he would have driven a much harder bargain with

00:15.525 --> 00:17.725
Stalin during those fateful negotiations.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.235
- For Churchill…
- Excuse me Mrs O’Malley.

00:20.236 --> 00:21.280
Excuse me, please.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.063
Rory Gilmore, there's been a mistake.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.993
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.113
And take your things with
you. You won't be coming back.

00:36.714 --> 00:37.195
What?

00:37.196 --> 00:38.970
Come on. Quickly.

00:38.971 --> 00:39.699
But?

01:01.890 --> 01:04.072
Mom, I had the most awful day

01:01.736 --> 01:05.575
Hi. I thought I would miss you.

01:05.576 --> 01:06.545
Where are you going?

01:06.546 --> 01:08.341
Well, I'm going to Hawaii

01:08.342 --> 01:08.735
Hawaii?

01:09.036 --> 01:10.154
Yeah. Hawaii

01:10.155 --> 01:10.431
Why?

01:10.432 --> 01:11.363
'Cause I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.

01:11.364 --> 01:12.140
I didn't know that

01:12.141 --> 01:13.370
Yes, well

01:13.371 --> 01:14.566
Well, when are you coming back?

01:14.567 --> 01:16.405
I don't now.
How many ounces can you take on the pLane?

01:16.406 --> 01:17.541
Two, Three I forget.

01:17.542 --> 01:19.009
Mum, I really need to talk

01:19.010 --> 01:19.922
Plane.

01:20.223 --> 01:21.861
Well how am I gonna be
able to get in touch with you?

01:21.862 --> 01:23.111
You can't. I need a break, kid.

01:23.112 --> 01:25.149
Take it easy. Try not to kill any plants

01:34.526 --> 01:36.475
Salman wants to come over for dinner this weekend.

01:36.688 --> 01:38.519
Is he bringing that boring wife of his?

01:38.520 --> 01:40.115
Padma is fine.

01:40.116 --> 01:42.714
Cookbooks, Doyle. Her
husband wrote "The Satanic Verses,"

01:42.715 --> 01:44.309
and all you'd want to talk about is cookbooks.

01:44.310 --> 01:45.476
I like "Top Chef."

01:45.477 --> 01:47.537
Fine, but I'm on call all this weekend,

01:47.538 --> 01:49.524
so here's hoping for a heart transplant.

01:49.530 --> 01:51.882
- I finally had to fire Broder.
- Really?

01:51.683 --> 01:53.838
He knew it was coming, but still...

01:53.839 --> 01:56.096
Well being Executive Editor of the Washington Post

01:56.097 --> 01:59.863
does have its drawbacks.
oh! hi Rory

02:00.280 --> 02:01.268
hi

02:01.269 --> 02:02.540
What are you doing here?

02:03.752 --> 02:04.621
This is my house

02:05.022 --> 02:06.560
Rory, we've been through this.

02:06.561 --> 02:11.002
It will always be your house
in your heart, but we own it now

02:11.003 --> 02:12.081
What are you talking about?

02:12.082 --> 02:13.079
You need money, kid?

02:13.080 --> 02:15.456
No, at least,I don't think I do

02:16.396 --> 02:17.119
Here

02:17.120 --> 02:17.804
what are you doing?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.130
Don’t think of it as charity.

02:19.131 --> 02:22.108
Think of it as a gift -- a charitable gift.

02:22.109 --> 02:22.866
But

02:23.267 --> 02:23.867
You better get going.

02:23.868 --> 02:25.595
Yeah you don’t want to be late.

02:25.596 --> 02:26.264
For what?

02:26.265 --> 02:27.330
Uh, work?

02:28.412 --> 02:29.925
Oh, and don’t forget your poker.

02:29.926 --> 02:31.831
That trash isn't gonna pick up itself.

02:55.689 --> 02:57.479
Subtitle by Maglori

03:44.691 --> 03:46.761
I'm in better shape than I was before the heart attack.

03:46.762 --> 03:48.741
Well you do look great, dad. Very Lance Armstrong.

03:48.742 --> 03:49.401
what do you think hon?

03:49.402 --> 03:50.523
You look great, grandpa.

03:50.524 --> 03:52.354
Ah lost 11 pounds

03:52.355 --> 03:54.610
You can tell. You're super-ripped under that jacket.

03:54.611 --> 03:56.533
Well I've gotten into a good routine with the exercise,

03:56.534 --> 03:58.578
and now I can't imagine a day without it.

03:58.579 --> 04:00.772
Yeah grandma better keep
an eye on you over at the club.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.428
Eh Rory, I'm so sorry
that Logan couldn't join us tonight.

04:04.429 --> 04:07.248
Oh he was, too, but all his
meetings in California have been going so well,

04:07.249 --> 04:08.671
he decided to extend his trip.

04:08.672 --> 04:09.684
Good job prospects?

04:09.685 --> 04:12.362
I think so. He's making a lot of great contacts.

04:12.996 --> 04:14.054
Well, next time.

04:14.155 --> 04:16.281
So, when do finals start?

04:16.283 --> 04:19.998
Uh, tomorrow, actually. Irony from Milton to Byron

04:19.999 --> 04:22.264
- ha
- I hope we're not keeping you from your studies.

04:22.265 --> 04:24.477
Oh, no. It was so nice to get a break

04:24.478 --> 04:25.685
from being in that library all day.

04:25.686 --> 04:27.922
Actually It's nice to talk above a whisper.

04:29.099 --> 04:32.215
Well, your grandfather
and I have a little surprise for you.

04:32.216 --> 04:33.508
- Uh-oh.
- what?

04:33.709 --> 04:35.890
- Did you name another building after her?
- NO

04:35.891 --> 04:38.908
No I know I know, you
bought Yale and named it Rory.

04:38.909 --> 04:42.241
From now on, the Ivy League is
going to be Harvard, Princeton, and Rory.

04:42.242 --> 04:44.284
- Has a nice sound, though.
- A nice ring to it.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.054
"Hey, I'll meet you at the Rory/Harvard game."

04:46.855 --> 04:48.247
Your grandfather and I have decided to

04:48.248 --> 04:51.052
purchase a little Pied-Terre in the city.

04:51.053 --> 04:54.143
Nothing fancy. Just a little
two-bedroom on the Upper East Side.

04:54.144 --> 04:54.892
That's exciting.

04:54.893 --> 04:57.464
Now we realize that the Upper East Side is not

04:57.465 --> 05:00.428
the most convenient address
for an employee of the New York Times,

05:00.429 --> 05:02.703
but it's just a 20-minute cab ride to work.

05:02.704 --> 05:04.683
You're giving her an apartment, mom?

05:04.684 --> 05:07.241
No. It'll be our apartment but Rory's to live in.

05:07.242 --> 05:09.612
Of course we would never drop by unannounced.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.238
Well, that goes without saying.

05:11.239 --> 05:13.474
We would just come in on the occasional weekend

05:13.475 --> 05:14.735
and maybe stay over some nights

05:14.736 --> 05:15.992
when we're going to be in the city late.

05:15.993 --> 05:18.682
Hear that, honey?
You and grandma are gonna be roomies.

05:18.683 --> 05:19.683
So, what do you think?

05:19.684 --> 05:22.129
Oh It's a very generous offer.

05:22.130 --> 05:23.965
Oh, we're glad to do it.

05:23.966 --> 05:27.020
But I don't know if I'm actually gonna be moving

05:27.021 --> 05:28.238
to New York after I graduate.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.773
I didn't get the internship at the New York Times.

05:30.774 --> 05:32.534
- what?
- you didn'?

05:32.569 --> 05:33.679
That's terrible.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.775
When did you find that out?

05:34.776 --> 05:37.394
Um, yesterday. It's not a big deal.

05:37.662 --> 05:42.745
Well, this is preposterous.
Who could be more qualified than you?

05:42.746 --> 05:45.329
and they only take a couple of people, so...

05:40.872 --> 05:45.329
Well the Reston fellowship is very competitive,

05:45.364 --> 05:46.114
This is outrageous.

05:46.115 --> 05:48.739
You rose to editor in chief of the Yale Daily News.

05:48.740 --> 05:52.696
What else do they want,
an exclusive interview with Osama Bin Laden?

05:52.797 --> 05:53.928
Why didn't you tell me?

05:53.929 --> 05:57.080
'Cause I just found out,
and I was so busy studying for finals.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.402
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

05:58.910 --> 06:02.207
Oh, it's okay. I'm just,
as I said, trying to put it behind me.

06:03.615 --> 06:04.774
I'm sure it's nepotism.

06:04.775 --> 06:06.279
If your name isn't Keller or Sulzberger,

06:06.280 --> 06:07.799
you may as well not even apply.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.947
Oh, grandma, it's okay, I promise. Um actually,

06:10.948 --> 06:13.399
I need to get back to Yale soon to keep studying,

06:13.400 --> 06:15.022
and I'm kind of hungry -- could we eat?

06:15.057 --> 06:17.055
Yeah, let's get dinner started. Mom? Dad?

06:17.056 --> 06:21.039
Well yes, let's eat. I'll have
Alexandra serve the salads at once.

06:23.970 --> 06:27.195
Hi, hon, it's me. Just calling to check in

06:28.396 --> 06:30.746
and wish you luck this
morning. I know it's your first final,

06:30.747 --> 06:33.235
and I know you're gonna knock their socks off or

06:33.236 --> 06:35.503
their bow ties or
whatever it is you knock off professors

06:35.504 --> 06:36.729
when you're trying to impress them.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.610
Call me when you're done. I love you. Bye.

06:39.629 --> 06:42.446
“My funny valentine”
it doesn’t work, it’s April already.

06:42.447 --> 06:43.989
What about “Down with love” to open.

06:43.990 --> 06:46.516
open It’s too depressing.

06:46.517 --> 06:49.071
It’s not depressing, it’s ironic.

06:49.072 --> 06:52.184
People don’t listen to music for irony.

06:52.185 --> 06:54.656
- What about “Weird Al”
- Weird who?

06:54.657 --> 06:57.316
- Hi girls.
-  Lorelai.
- Hi hon.

06:57.317 --> 06:57.811
What’s with the whisper?

06:57.812 --> 06:59.127
We’re saving our voices

06:59.128 --> 07:00.468
I think that ship has sailed.

07:00.469 --> 07:03.852
Oh we’re debuting our
cabaret act tonight at KC’s.

07:03.853 --> 07:06.401
OH I thought Saturdays
was karaoke night at KC’s.

07:06.602 --> 07:07.916
It is so we went over there this morning

07:07.917 --> 07:10.435
to sign our selves up for the first 15 songs.

07:10.436 --> 07:12.501
Well I’m sure the karaoke regulars will love that.

07:12.802 --> 07:15.364
So what do you think
Lorelai, to open with the show.

07:15.365 --> 07:17.708
Streisand or Porter?

07:17.709 --> 07:19.416
You can not go wrong with either one.

07:19.617 --> 07:20.730
You gonna be there right.

07:20.731 --> 07:25.989
You gotta come hon, it’s
gonna be fantastic…  Fantastic.

07:26.290 --> 07:27.009
- Hey
- Hey

07:27.210 --> 07:30.392
Okay her you go ladies.
Little hot water for you Miss Patty

07:30.427 --> 07:32.774
and for you Babette a bowl of shredded wheat.

07:33.075 --> 07:35.571
It’s for my throat, it give it a rougher quality,

07:35.572 --> 07:39.648
a husk sound sorta like
Debbie Herry meets Eithal Herman.

07:39.649 --> 07:40.948
- What?
- What?
- What?

07:40.949 --> 07:41.749
- Nothing.
- Okay.

07:41.750 --> 07:42.484
I’m just getting some coffee.

07:42.485 --> 07:43.485
- To go.
- Yeah.

07:43.486 --> 07:44.376
Coming right up.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.590
- Oh you preparing for the big boat trip huh.
-Yeap.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.752
- Wow you want me just to talk in nautical terms till you go.

07:53.753 --> 07:54.827
- No.
-  Eye, eye captain.

07:54.828 --> 07:56.266
- Please don’t.
- Shiver me timbers.

07:56.467 --> 07:57.004
Are you done.

07:57.005 --> 07:58.250
All hands on deck. Now I’m done.

07:58.251 --> 07:58.894
Good.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.803
So where you going?

08:00.104 --> 08:01.678
Ah we’re thinking of heading up the coast.

08:01.679 --> 08:03.001
Oh up is good.

08:03.002 --> 08:04.002
Should be fine.

08:04.003 --> 08:06.775
You're really going on a boat
trip, you sure that's a good idea.

08:06.776 --> 08:07.688
What's wring with a boat trip?

08:07.689 --> 08:09.453
- Well for starters you're on a boat.
- so

08:09.454 --> 08:11.445
So, anything could go wrong,

08:11.446 --> 08:13.346
you're on a boat in the middle of no where,

08:13.347 --> 08:16.716
haven't you seen "Dead
Calm" "Open Water" "Das Boot".

08:17.017 --> 08:19.623
Okay first of all I did not purchase a U boat.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.638
Titanic, surely you've seen Titanic!

08:21.759 --> 08:23.670
Aprils very excited about this.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.589
sure she is

08:24.590 --> 08:25.342
Here's your coffee.

08:25.543 --> 08:26.935
Look instead of paying for this can

08:26.936 --> 08:28.460
I just give you some of my stage advice.

08:28.861 --> 08:29.711
I'd rather have the dollar.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.795
April says she's very excited.

08:31.796 --> 08:33.049
Very excited.

08:33.051 --> 08:34.357
Yeah she says she's very excited,

08:34.359 --> 08:37.756
but if I were you I would
plan a couple of nights at a hotel

08:37.758 --> 08:40.302
so she can wash her hair and order room service.

08:40.303 --> 08:41.775
- That's what I would do .
- Okay.

08:41.777 --> 08:43.732
Okay, and if you're heading
up the coast you have to spend

08:43.734 --> 08:45.596
as much time as possible on
the southern coast of Maine.

08:45.597 --> 08:46.141
Yeah.

08:46.142 --> 08:48.220
And you have to go to a
place called Barnacle Billies.

08:48.221 --> 08:49.134
"Barnacle Billies"

08:49.135 --> 08:50.578
The best lobster you have every had

08:50.579 --> 08:53.528
and you sit on the deck and never want to leave.

08:53.529 --> 08:54.435
Okay I'll check it out.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.930
For all that extra advice don't I get a donut?

08:57.955 --> 08:59.390
- Thank you very much.
- Mu-mm

09:00.940 --> 09:02.209
Bye Patty, bye Babette.

09:02.210 --> 09:07.224
So long, farewell. Auf weidersehen goodbye, goodbye.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.249
Hey.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.930
Hey, Rory. Everybody, 
this is my roommate, Rory.

09:17.931 --> 09:20.596
Rory, this is Elise, 
Karen, Robin, Tim, and Edwin.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.554
All fellow Yale seniors and

09:24.555 --> 09:26.662
all recently accepted 
into Harvard Medical school.

09:26.663 --> 09:28.405
Oh, wow. Congratulations

09:28.806 --> 09:31.285
Thank you! Thank you.

09:31.286 --> 09:32.802
When word spread 
around campus about who got in,

09:32.803 --> 09:34.359
we decided to get together and celebrate.

09:34.860 --> 09:35.508
Cool.

09:36.046 --> 09:39.011
A good chance to size up
 the competition. I know robin, 

09:39.012 --> 09:41.920
Karen, and Edwin from 
ORGO, and I'm comfortable that 

09:41.921 --> 09:43.357
when the time comes, I can crush them. 

09:43.358 --> 09:44.855
Elise and Tim are new to me, 

09:44.856 --> 09:46.323
but Elise's hand was shaking a little 

09:46.324 --> 09:47.331
when she was cutting into the cake, 

09:47.332 --> 09:49.758
so I've got her pegged 
for an early exit into podiatry.

09:49.759 --> 09:50.893
Sounds like quite a party.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.875
It really is. 
Do you want some cake?

09:54.265 --> 09:55.380
Oh. Definitely not.

09:55.381 --> 09:56.945
We tried to get a corpse cake, 

09:56.946 --> 09:58.996
but we couldn't find a 
bakery that would make us one, 

09:58.997 --> 10:02.265
so we had to settle for a naked-guy
cake from an erotic bakery in Hartford.

10:02.266 --> 10:04.124
Yes it's a little early for cake for me.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.394
It actually tastes pretty good once 

10:05.395 --> 10:07.254
you get past the pornographic-dessert issue. 

10:07.255 --> 10:09.244
Sure I can't interest you in a fibula?

10:09.245 --> 10:10.245
No, thanks.

10:10.246 --> 10:12.901
Here's your mail. You got a 
letter from the Chicago Sun-Times.

10:12.902 --> 10:23.460
Oh. Great. 
They're not hiring.

10:23.861 --> 10:26.415
Bummer. You okay?

10:26.416 --> 10:28.649
Yeah. I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

10:29.523 --> 10:31.343
You want to hang out, have a little champagne?

10:31.344 --> 10:33.641
 I could use an extra pair of eyes out here.

10:33.642 --> 10:36.111
I would, but I have a final in one hour,

10:36.112 --> 10:38.032
 so I'm gonna go shower
 and close my eyes for a bit.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.497
Sure. We'll try to keep it down.

10:39.498 --> 10:41.457
Okay. Thanks. Nice meeting you, everyone.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.678
- Bye, Rory.
- Bye!

11:05.092 --> 11:10.185
Hi. Um, I'm calling for
 Kate Hessel? Rory Gilmore.

11:11.886 --> 11:19.661
 Okay….Hello, Kate? Um, 
hi. This is Rory Gilmore. Good.

11:19.662 --> 11:23.940
 I'm well. How are you?
 Um, yeah, finals and everything. 

11:23.941 --> 11:25.857
It's just really crazy right now. 

11:25.858 --> 11:31.001
But, um, the reason
 why I was calling is, uh, well,

11:31.002 --> 11:33.456
 I know that initially
 I said that I wasn't interested

11:33.457 --> 11:35.315
 in the job at the
 providence journal-bulletin, 

11:35.316 --> 11:39.156
but I was thinking about 
it, and it's such a great job. 

11:39.157 --> 11:42.250
It's such a wonderful 
opportunity that I was wondering 

11:42.251 --> 11:47.248
if maybe…no. Right.
 Of course you did. No.

11:48.850 --> 11:51.864
 It's such a great job. 
I mean, of course you've already,

11:51.865 --> 11:56.603
 uh, filled the position. 
I just thought I would, uh, check

11:56.604 --> 12:00.718
…that I would call 
just in case. Well, thanks.

12:19.995 --> 12:22.429
- Hey.
- Hey! Taste.

12:22.430 --> 12:23.525
- What?
- Taste.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.263
- Oh, it's a meatball.
- So good.

12:25.264 --> 12:26.044
It's 9:00 A.M.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.706
Look It's amazing. I completely forgot

12:28.707 --> 12:30.552
 how pregnancy scrambles my taste buds. 

12:30.553 --> 12:32.443
I swear, it doesn't even taste like a meatball.

12:32.444 --> 12:33.481
Does it taste like a Danish?

12:33.482 --> 12:38.377
Well okay, then, for lunch. So?

12:38.378 --> 12:41.600
So...I went into Luke's diner this morning, 

12:41.601 --> 12:43.883
and he was wearing the hat I gave him.

12:44.284 --> 12:45.539
You gave Luke a hat.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.708
No, not recently. 
Years ago -- for Christmas.

12:47.709 --> 12:48.854
Oh, yeah, the blue hat.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.369
Yes, the blue hat. 
And he hasn't worn it since we broke up, 

12:52.370 --> 12:54.997
I mean not once. I don't 
blame him. It's totally understandable.

12:55.298 --> 12:57.537
Oh, yeah, you're right. 
He wears that black hat now.

12:57.538 --> 12:59.734
 It gives him a slightly more menacing quality.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.944
But then suddenly today, I walk into the diner, 

13:01.945 --> 13:05.040
- and there it is, atop his head.
- Atop.

13:05.041 --> 13:07.110
Yes, atop his head. 
What do you think that means?

13:07.111 --> 13:08.637
-It's good.
-Good how?

13:08.938 --> 13:11.737
 Well, you know, he's past
 his pain, you're talking again, 

13:11.738 --> 13:14.244
you've cleared the air, 
you're coming into the diner again, 

13:14.245 --> 13:16.316
and, you know, he's wearing your hat.

13:16.517 --> 13:19.518
Yeah. That's nice, right?
 I should probably reciprocate.

13:19.519 --> 13:20.350
Reciprocate?

13:20.351 --> 13:22.535
Yeah, you know he's doing something friendly. 

13:22.536 --> 13:24.450
I should probably do something friendly back 

13:24.451 --> 13:26.136
-- wear my own hat, as it were.

13:26.437 --> 13:27.659
Did he give you a hat?

13:27.660 --> 13:28.810
No, that's the problem.

13:29.530 --> 13:31.369
Did he give you any 
friendship thing you can wear?

13:31.370 --> 13:33.911
No, you know, I got
 rid of all my Luke-related stuff.

13:33.912 --> 13:34.934
Oh.

13:34.935 --> 13:36.125
We've made such progress lately. 

13:36.126 --> 13:39.094
You know I don't want to leave
 his hat gesture unacknowledged.

13:39.095 --> 13:42.038
Hey, you could always throw on a flannel shirt.

13:42.039 --> 13:43.242
That's a good idea.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.608
God, are you sure you don't want to try this?

13:46.609 --> 13:47.928
 What if I scrambled it with some eggs?

13:47.929 --> 13:52.870
-No.
-Really? Mmm!

14:12.500 --> 14:14.093
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:14.094 --> 14:14.930
Are they both down?

14:14.931 --> 14:17.629
Yes. Three choruses of "Nappy Nappy Time Time" 

14:17.630 --> 14:19.277
and 20 minutes of Rhythmic Shooshing, .

14:19.278 --> 14:20.143
and they both conked out. 

14:20.144 --> 14:21.681
Kwan fought it a little harder than Steve did, 

14:21.682 --> 14:23.632
- but they're both really tired
- Good work.

14:24.378 --> 14:27.557
I don't know what to do first -- sleep or eat. Eat!

14:27.558 --> 14:29.741
- Hi.
- Hi!

14:30.495 --> 14:32.262
So they didn't have those potato rolls you like,

14:32.263 --> 14:35.927
 so I got the hamburger rolls which
 most closely resembled the potato rolls. 

14:35.928 --> 14:36.959
I checked the ingredients, 

14:36.960 --> 14:38.640
and potatoes aren't actually listed in there.

14:38.641 --> 14:41.113
 But are potato rolls made from actual potatoes, 

14:41.114 --> 14:43.408
or is that just an 
expression like "finger sandwiches"?

14:43.709 --> 14:45.206
- Um, Zach?
- Yeah? 

14:46.050 --> 14:50.290
Name-brand diapers and, 
oh, name-brand chips? Are you crazy?

14:50.291 --> 14:51.684
I just thought I'd splurge a little.

14:51.685 --> 14:53.241
We are on a budget.

14:53.242 --> 14:55.793
I know, but I got amazing news in the store. 

14:55.794 --> 14:57.363
This is the only way I could think to celebrate.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.145
What news?

14:58.146 --> 14:59.321
Okay. You ready?

14:59.322 --> 15:02.474
 I was in the frozen-foods aisle 
when I get this call from Graham. 

15:02.475 --> 15:03.234
You remember graham.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.105
From vapor rub? 

15:04.106 --> 15:06.119
Yeah we saw them play
last year at the mercury lounge.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.844
Yeah well, great news. 

15:07.845 --> 15:10.208
Their lead guitarist got
 into this wicked car accident, 

15:10.209 --> 15:11.581
which isn't the great part, clearly.

15:11.582 --> 15:14.011
 He's gonna be fine, but 
the use of his right hand is pretty iffy. 

15:14.012 --> 15:16.713
Anyway, they need a
 new guitarist, and they called me.

15:16.714 --> 15:18.455
- Lead guitarist?
- Lead guitarist.

15:18.456 --> 15:19.479
- For vapor rub?
- I know.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.696
Oh my God I want to yell,
 but I don't want to wake the babies. 

15:21.697 --> 15:22.627
I'm yelling on the inside.

15:22.628 --> 15:24.367
They're going on a 2-month tour this summer, 

15:24.368 --> 15:25.535
and they want me to join them.

15:25.536 --> 15:26.234
I can't believe it.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.928
Graham talked me through 
the whole thing, It's the perfect setup. 

15:28.929 --> 15:31.335
8 weeks, 25 cities, 40 shows.

15:31.336 --> 15:33.216
 The whole thing's already practically sold out, 

15:33.217 --> 15:34.438
and they have this awesome tour bus. 

15:34.439 --> 15:36.245
And they're cool with
 you and the boys coming along, 

15:36.246 --> 15:38.176
'cause I said, "I can't go
 if I can't bring the family,"

15:38.177 --> 15:40.135
 and he talked to the band aand they were into it.

15:40.136 --> 15:40.898
Seriously?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.481
Yeah one guy's bringing his girlfriend. 

15:42.482 --> 15:44.242
The bassist has a puppy. It's totally cool.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.910
Right now, I am howling at the top of my lungs.

15:46.911 --> 15:49.108
Just wait. When we're in Philly and D.C., 

15:49.109 --> 15:50.974
We're gonna be opening for Tokyo Police Club.

15:50.975 --> 15:53.210
Foot stomping, so much 
foot stomping happening here!

15:53.211 --> 15:54.446
Yeah the bands are really tight.

15:54.447 --> 15:56.736
 We're playing at the 930 club, the Black Cat,

15:56.737 --> 15:57.846
 and the first Unitarian, 

15:57.847 --> 16:00.382
and we don't even have to bring our own backline.

16:00.383 --> 16:01.140
Shut up!

16:01.141 --> 16:03.669
Graham's always been a big fan of my songwriting, 

16:03.670 --> 16:05.591
and he said he'd totally 
give my new stuff a listen.

16:06.317 --> 16:09.159
So many people are gonna 
see you play -- I mean, a real tour.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.274
And it's a million times better 
than that Seventh-Day Adventist tour. 

16:12.275 --> 16:15.052
We get to stay in actual
 motel rooms, not church basements, 

16:15.053 --> 16:16.590
and we don't have to run our lyrics past 

16:16.591 --> 16:17.955
the church elders before every show.

16:19.040 --> 16:24.622
I am so proud of you, Zach. 
Now let's pop open the name-brand chips!

16:24.623 --> 16:26.189
You want to wake the babies and tell them?

16:26.190 --> 16:27.633
Do it and die.

16:51.920 --> 17:03.400
Rory! Rory? Honey?

17:03.401 --> 17:05.878
- Yeah?
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.136
Whatcha doing?

17:08.137 --> 17:11.454
- Hiding.
- From...
- The world.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.767
What's going on?
 Want to talk about it?

17:15.768 --> 17:16.881
I tanked it.

17:16.882 --> 17:18.020
What did you tank?

17:18.021 --> 17:18.977
My final.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.596
Oh, I'm sure you didn't tank it.

17:21.597 --> 17:22.561
I'm pretty sure I did.

17:22.563 --> 17:23.496
Why?

17:23.497 --> 17:25.169
'Cause I didn't even turn in all of it.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.857
Oh, sweetie.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.853
If I didn't fail it, I didn't do better than a "C"... 

17:28.854 --> 17:34.289
or a C-minus... or a "D." Oh, what if I got a "d"?

17:34.290 --> 17:35.461
Well, that's okay.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.556
No, it's not. I mean I knew my stuff you know. 

17:38.557 --> 17:40.450
The questions were exactly what I anticipated. 

17:40.451 --> 17:44.771
I could have written about 
"Paradise Lost" for hours in those blue books, 

17:44.772 --> 17:46.724
but halfway through the third blue book,

17:46.725 --> 17:48.988
 I just started thinking, "what is the point?

17:48.989 --> 17:50.308
 I'm never gonna get a job, anyway."

17:50.309 --> 17:52.010
Not true -- you are gonna get a job.

17:52.011 --> 17:54.244
I'm not. The New York Times doesn't want me. 

17:54.245 --> 17:56.629
I got a letter from the 
Chicago Sun-Times. They're not hiring.

17:56.630 --> 17:58.967
 I even called the Providence Journal-Bulletin 

17:58.968 --> 18:00.098
and begged for that job, 

18:00.099 --> 18:01.319
but they already gave it to someone else, 

18:01.320 --> 18:04.587
some non-idiot who didn't think 
they were too good and turn it down.

18:05.050 --> 18:05.921
You're not an idiot.

18:05.922 --> 18:08.282
I am. Everyone's probably laughing at me. 

18:08.283 --> 18:10.430
I can probably never show 
my face in Providence again.

18:10.431 --> 18:11.574
I think you probably can.

18:11.775 --> 18:13.270
Not without hearing the snickers

18:13.271 --> 18:15.479
 and the people pointing 
and laughing at the unemployed,

18:15.480 --> 18:16.720
 homeless Yale dropout.

18:16.921 --> 18:20.468
Honey, you had a 
setback, and that is really terrible, 

18:20.469 --> 18:22.526
but you are so smart and so talented. 

18:22.527 --> 18:26.204
And there is some paper
 out there that is gonna hire 

18:26.205 --> 18:28.810
you as their future superstar. That's just a fact.

18:28.811 --> 18:29.404
Yeah, right.

18:29.405 --> 18:30.942
Look I think you're having a meltdown, 

18:30.943 --> 18:33.882
so it's good you came home, 
because it's sad and disappointing, 

18:33.883 --> 18:35.621
and everyone needs to 
have a meltdown once in a while. 

18:35.622 --> 18:36.738
I speak from experience.

18:36.739 --> 18:39.037
-Ugh.
- When is your next final?

18:39.038 --> 18:40.235
Not for another four days.

18:40.236 --> 18:42.975
Well see? That gives you plenty of time to melt.

18:43.845 --> 18:45.093
This is all your fault, you know?

18:45.094 --> 18:45.642
Why?

18:45.643 --> 18:47.229
Because you told me I could do anything.

18:47.990 --> 18:48.465
You can.

18:48.466 --> 18:49.530
Apparently, I can't, 

18:49.531 --> 18:51.309
and I have two rejection letters and

18:51.310 --> 18:52.916
 a humiliating phone call to prove it. 

18:52.917 --> 18:54.344
Do you know what the worst part of this is? 

18:54.545 --> 18:57.069
I thought I was so in at the Times.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.667
 I was just saying that I wasn't gonna get it. 

18:59.668 --> 19:02.143
I was trying to be humble, but I was so not humble. 

19:02.144 --> 19:04.540
I was so cocky. 
I was picturing myself working there

19:04.541 --> 19:07.402
chatting up Bill Keller in the elevator and 

19:07.403 --> 19:09.440
running down the street
 for a quick lunch with Maureen Dowd 

19:09.441 --> 19:12.534
and filing my first story 
and seeing my first byline. 

19:12.535 --> 19:15.673
I already had the outfit picked 
out for my New York Times picture I.D.

19:15.674 --> 19:17.165
The new suit with the red theory shirt.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.850
Yeah. And now I have to 
tell everyone that I didn't get it. 

19:19.851 --> 19:20.532
And I don't want too. 

19:20.533 --> 19:23.345
Just telling grandma and
 grandpa made me feel ashamed and

19:23.346 --> 19:25.767
 humiliated all over again, 
which is why I didn't tell you. 

19:25.768 --> 19:29.613
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
It just sucks disappointing everyone.

19:30.550 --> 19:34.473
Honey... you could
 never disappoint me -- ever.

19:36.245 --> 19:38.911
- Yeah?
- Ever, ever.

19:38.912 --> 19:42.055
- Yeah.
-Ever.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.344
Have you seen Steve's Paci?

19:48.345 --> 19:49.100
His what?

19:49.101 --> 19:52.203
His pacifier. It's green. 
He loses his mind without it. 

19:52.204 --> 19:53.169
Can you check by the sink? 

19:54.550 --> 19:57.052
I need to make a list of stuff to take on tour.

19:57.553 --> 20:00.038
Definitely. Zach says they're gonna be playing 

20:00.039 --> 20:01.492
the Bowery and Roseland.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.760
- Yep.
- Insane.
- Insane!

20:03.761 --> 20:07.658
I can't wait to see those shows. 
And opening for Tokyo Police Club?

20:07.659 --> 20:09.503
- And maybe Grizzly Bear.
- Really?

20:09.504 --> 20:11.670
Yeah I know, he got that call like an hour ago. 

20:11.671 --> 20:12.822
The whole thing is crazy.

20:13.223 --> 20:14.728
-  Uh-oh.
- What?

20:14.729 --> 20:15.650
Do you smell that?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.220
Well, that's one way to find out.

20:18.221 --> 20:20.680
Oh, man. I just changed him. 

20:20.681 --> 20:23.630
Can you put Steve in 
the stroller? I'll change Kwan.

20:23.631 --> 20:27.664
Got it. 
You know, their drummer's a bit of a lush.

20:28.065 --> 20:29.480
- Who?
- Vapor Rub.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.984
Oh, right. I know. Zach says
 he's, like, sober two hours a day.

20:33.985 --> 20:35.827
I'm just saying, one night that guy's 

20:35.828 --> 20:36.726
not gonna be able to go on. 

20:36.727 --> 20:37.657
You're gonna be waiting in the wings, 

20:37.658 --> 20:39.311
and -- boom -- you're 
their new full-time drummer.

20:39.312 --> 20:43.118
Wouldn't that be something? 
Oh, man. You're kidding me. 

20:43.119 --> 20:44.784
- What?
- False alarm.

20:45.785 --> 20:46.973
- Oh.
- What?

20:46.974 --> 20:49.546
Steve is now emitting a very foul odor.

20:49.547 --> 20:54.672
Oh… Bring him back. 
Oh, no, no. It's okay, Kwan. 

20:54.673 --> 20:56.343
Just a false alarm. I am sorry. 

20:56.344 --> 21:01.503
Just getting you dressed again. 
It's okay. He hates getting naked.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.308
You want his pacifier?

21:04.510 --> 21:07.264
It's okay. No, that's Steve's. Kwan's is, uh, red.

21:07.265 --> 21:09.672
Got it. Uh-oh.

21:10.673 --> 21:14.473
It's okay, Steve. He's coming 
right back. Maybe you should hold him.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.603
- Sure thing.
- Until I'm ready to change him.

21:15.604 --> 21:19.946
Sure thing. I hope the 
tour bus comes equipped with a nanny.

21:20.247 --> 21:23.314
Yeah, right. You want to come -- full-time "Manny"?

21:23.315 --> 21:27.243
I wouldn't last a day. 
I don't know how you do it, Lane.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.576
Yeah, it's a lot.
 My mom's actually been a huge help.

21:31.150 --> 21:32.341
Maybe you should take her with you.

21:32.742 --> 21:36.148
Yeah. Right. 
I'm sure I'll be fine.

21:36.149 --> 21:37.506
Yeah, definitely. 

21:37.507 --> 21:39.606
Zach says the bassist's girlfriend is coming along,

21:39.607 --> 21:40.937
 so, hopefully, she'll be good with kids.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.303
Yeah, hopefully.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.410
Alanis Morissette.

21:46.411 --> 21:47.494
- What? No.
- Yes.

21:48.465 --> 21:50.202
But she was successful right from the start.

21:50.203 --> 21:53.726
In Canada. She was on "Star Search." She dated Dave Coulier. 

21:53.727 --> 21:55.871
She struggled a lot before "Jagged Little Pill."

21:55.872 --> 21:57.168
I don't think that's a good example.

21:57.169 --> 21:58.483
- Jackson Pollock.
- Mom.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.494
He struggled before he 
succeeded, and I bet if you asked him now, 

22:01.495 --> 22:02.895
he would tell you he was glad for that.

22:02.896 --> 22:03.943
Jackson Pollock is dead.

22:03.944 --> 22:06.614
Yes, and from heaven he 
would tell you he was glad about that,

22:06.615 --> 22:09.209
 because god rewards those who struggle.

22:09.510 --> 22:11.749
Okay, mom, I get it. Setbacks make you stronger.

22:11.950 --> 22:14.796
A setback is really just a 
set-up for future accomplishment. 

22:15.097 --> 22:16.224
How's your mac and cheese?

22:16.225 --> 22:18.059
It's not having its usual effect.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.230
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.563
You know I'm not just saying
 this stuff. I really do believe it.

22:23.564 --> 22:24.295
I know you do mum.

22:24.296 --> 22:26.090
And I think you've had kind of an easy time. 

22:26.091 --> 22:28.579
I mean most of the things
 you've gone for you've gotten.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.002
 This setback might
 help you have some perspective.

22:31.203 --> 22:31.831
 I guess.

22:33.207 --> 22:35.327
Do you want some French 
toast? I think Caesar made it today. 

22:35.328 --> 22:36.508
It has extra brown sugar.

22:36.509 --> 22:41.050
- No, thanks.
Mark Twain.
- Hmm?

22:41.051 --> 22:43.931
Well Mark Twain had to work
 as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi 

22:43.932 --> 22:45.513
before he became a successful writer. 

22:45.514 --> 22:46.685
And If he'd never had that experience, 

22:46.686 --> 22:47.901
he never would have written "Huckleberry Finn."

22:47.902 --> 22:49.746
Which is one of your favorite books.

22:49.747 --> 22:51.768
 Remember when I made you have my 12th birthday 

22:51.769 --> 22:53.027
at the mark twain museum in Hartford?

22:53.428 --> 22:54.585
I thought one day I was gonna find you

22:54.586 --> 22:56.383
 on a raft made out of empty milk cartons, 

22:56.384 --> 22:58.080
sailing down the Housatonic river.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.043
- It's Logan.
- Go ahead.
- Go outside. 

23:03.021 --> 23:05.110
Hi. I'm okay.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.436
How's she holding up?

23:10.837 --> 23:14.900
Oh, she's okay. Rory's
 used to getting what Rory wants

23:14.901 --> 23:17.054
Yeah? I know. How you doing?

23:17.055 --> 23:20.075
- Me? I'm fine.
- Yeah?

23:21.631 --> 23:23.289
How's the, uh, trip-planning coming?

23:23.290 --> 23:25.926
Great. Great, I actually took your suggestion 

23:25.927 --> 23:28.326
and booked a couple hotels 
along the Maine coast -- Kittery, 

23:28.327 --> 23:32.671
York harbor. You know nothing
 fancy, just cable TV and a hot shower.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.304
That's great. I think she'll really love that.

23:34.505 --> 23:37.656
I even made a reservation at Barnacle Billy's.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.565
Bring me a "to go" box.

23:39.566 --> 23:42.565
Will do. You know, I'm getting pretty excited. 

23:42.566 --> 23:43.958
It's still a couple months away, 

23:43.959 --> 23:45.669
but the trip is really coming together. You know.

23:45.670 --> 23:47.126
 It's a lot of time on the water,

23:47.127 --> 23:49.720
 and we're gonna cover 
a lot of ground, but it's six weeks, 

23:49.721 --> 23:51.924
so I think, overall, it 
probably won't seem like so much.

23:52.694 --> 23:53.512
That sounds great. 

23:55.185 --> 23:57.990
Hey, Rory and I are gonna go see,

23:57.991 --> 24:00.878
 Um Patty and Babette's act at 
K.C.'S tonight. It should be a hoot.

24:01.779 --> 24:03.497
You know, not really my thing.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.897
Yeah. No. I'm not saying…

24:05.898 --> 24:06.684
No, I know.

24:06.985 --> 24:08.523
Just we're going, but, you know.

24:08.524 --> 24:09.699
Well, if I have some free time…

24:09.700 --> 24:10.362
No, no, no.

24:10.363 --> 24:11.353
Order up, Luke!

24:11.354 --> 24:12.644
- I should probably.
- Yeah.

24:12.645 --> 24:13.863
Can I get you anything else?

24:13.864 --> 24:14.879
A doggie bag.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.768
I'll take care of it.

24:15.769 --> 24:16.351
Okay.

24:19.352 --> 24:20.843
So, when are you coming back?

24:20.844 --> 24:21.477
Soon.

24:21.778 --> 24:24.501
How soon? It's been too long. 
You have to leave them wanting more.

24:24.602 --> 24:26.572
I'm booked on a red-eye tonight. But we'll see, 

24:26.573 --> 24:27.524
I have another meeting this afternoon. 

24:27.525 --> 24:28.756
If these guys want to do dinner,

24:28.757 --> 24:30.764
 drinks or something I may
 not have a choice. I'm sorry.

24:30.965 --> 24:33.100
That's okay. I'm just glad it's going well. 

24:33.101 --> 24:34.236
Think they're gonna make you an offer?

24:34.237 --> 24:35.618
I don't know it's hard to tell, 

24:35.619 --> 24:37.296
these guys play things pretty close to the vest.

24:37.297 --> 24:38.271
Well I'm sure they will. 

24:38.272 --> 24:39.727
All this time they're keeping you out there  

24:39.728 --> 24:41.684
it can't just be because
 of your good looks and charm.

24:41.685 --> 24:42.311
I hope not.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.030
Well, I guess I better let you go.

24:45.531 --> 24:46.738
Okay. I love you.

24:46.739 --> 24:47.576
I love you, too.

24:48.077 --> 24:50.960
And, hey, don't worry about
 the Times or the final or any of it.

24:50.961 --> 24:52.330
 I have a feeling, in the next couple days, 

24:52.331 --> 24:54.082
you will have moved on and forgotten all about this.

24:54.925 --> 24:55.762
I don't know.

24:56.785 --> 24:58.117
Things will be looking up, I promise.

24:59.795 --> 25:00.408
Call me later?

25:00.409 --> 25:02.548
- I will.
- Okay. Bye.

25:09.551 --> 25:12.194
- Hey.
- Hey. How's the left coast?

25:12.900 --> 25:14.392
He sounds good, very positive.

25:14.393 --> 25:15.881
Good. You ready to go shopping?

25:15.882 --> 25:18.181
Yes, there's nothing I love 
more than shopping after a huge meal.

25:18.182 --> 25:19.713
- Lets go.
- Bye, Luke.

25:19.714 --> 25:20.470
Take care, Rory.

25:20.471 --> 25:21.606
Luke changed his hat.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.206
Did he?

25:24.772 --> 25:25.623
Luke's.

25:25.624 --> 25:26.784
Hey, dad.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.584
April, hey. What's going on?

25:28.585 --> 25:30.223
Not much. How are you?

25:30.498 --> 25:31.805
Good. Doing the lunch thing.

25:31.806 --> 25:33.205
I tried you on your home phone first. 

25:33.206 --> 25:34.471
I don't know what I was thinking.

25:34.772 --> 25:36.604
Well another 10 minutes,
 and I'd have been up there. 

25:36.605 --> 25:38.382
So, what's going on? Just call to say hi?

25:39.139 --> 25:40.375
Actually, I've got some news. 

25:40.576 --> 25:41.966
Good news, I hope.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.237
Good and bad, actually.

25:44.888 --> 25:45.389
Tell me.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.855
Well, in January, 

25:47.856 --> 25:50.929
I filled out this application 
for the Metropolitan museum science camp. 

25:50.930 --> 25:53.083
I wasn't even gonna do it, but Mr. Lazovic, 

25:53.084 --> 25:54.015
my chemistry teacher -- 

25:54.016 --> 25:56.868
he wrote me this really 
nice recommendation. Anyway, 

25:56.869 --> 25:57.972
I totally forgot about it,

25:57.973 --> 26:00.868
 'cause I didn't think I'd ever get in, but I did.

26:01.709 --> 26:05.587
Wow, April. Congratulations. That's terrific.

26:06.588 --> 26:09.366
Yeah, it is. The only problem is it's six weeks, 

26:09.367 --> 26:12.371
- and it's right during our boat trip.
- Oh.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.610
Yeah and I've been so torn because

26:14.611 --> 26:16.412
 I really want to take this trip with you, 

26:16.413 --> 26:19.437
but this camp is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

26:19.438 --> 26:20.874
They only take eighth-graders,

26:20.875 --> 26:22.215
 so this would be the only year I could go,

26:23.060 --> 26:24.936
 and they would have
 kids from all over the world there, 

26:24.937 --> 26:28.088
and they'd have Nobel-winning 
scientists come and teach classes and stuff.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.579
Yeah well, that sounds, uh, pretty incredible.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.848
Yeah, but I really want to take this trip with you.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.756
Yeah, look, it's too good an
 opportunity for you to pass up.

26:40.757 --> 26:41.616
You think?

26:41.617 --> 26:44.757
I do. I mean the boat's not 
going anywhere. We'll do it next summer.

26:45.550 --> 26:48.211
- Okay. Are you sure?
- Absolutely. 

26:48.212 --> 26:50.262
Okay and It's only six weeks, 

26:50.263 --> 26:51.391
so I could definitely spend 

26:51.392 --> 26:52.560
the last two weeks of the summer with you.

26:52.561 --> 26:54.861
Well then that's great. 
We'll take a little trip somewhere.

26:54.862 --> 26:56.017
Yeah, definitely.

26:56.318 --> 26:58.244
I am so proud of you, kid.

26:58.845 --> 27:01.353
Thanks, dad. Um, I'm gonna
 tell mom that we talked, okay?

27:01.654 --> 27:02.702
Okay. I'll call you later.

27:03.003 --> 27:04.280
- Love you.
- Love you, too. 

27:27.486 --> 27:28.426
Very nice!

27:32.267 --> 27:34.366
You're a terrific crowd!

27:34.367 --> 27:38.562
Yeah we have one more song, 
and then karaoke night will begin.

27:41.590 --> 27:44.617
I dedicate this next song to my husband, Morey.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.676
Hey, do you know what would 
really put me over the top spirit-wise?

28:15.677 --> 28:16.256
What?

28:16.457 --> 28:17.364
If you sang.

28:17.365 --> 28:22.055
Oh, yeah! On the way home, 
we'll roll down the windows. I'll belt it out.

28:22.056 --> 28:23.180
No. Up there.

28:23.850 --> 28:25.533
Oh, no. I'd have to be way more drunk for that.

28:25.534 --> 28:29.542
Well, we can arrange that. 
Excuse me. Could we get some shots here?

28:33.800 --> 28:35.935
I've never even been to 
half the cities we're going to.

28:35.936 --> 28:37.656
 I mean, Detroit -- how psyched am I?

28:37.657 --> 28:38.576
You seem really psyched.

28:38.577 --> 28:42.464
I'm totally psyched. Detroit is
 a major music hub, man, for everybody.

28:42.465 --> 28:44.997
 It's not just about Eminem 
and Iggy pop and Motown.

28:44.998 --> 28:45.784
Oh no.

28:45.785 --> 28:48.277
And we're not just playing 
anywhere. We're playing The Magic Stick. 

28:48.278 --> 28:50.855
Everybody's played The
 Magic Stick -- crooked fingers, 

28:50.856 --> 28:53.025
The Rose Buds, Bobby Conn, Midlay.

28:53.026 --> 28:54.289
- Wow.
- It's gonna be nuts.

28:54.290 --> 28:56.141
I'm really happy for you, Zach.

28:56.142 --> 28:58.649
And it just works out so perfect time wise.

28:58.650 --> 29:01.176
 I mean obviously, I'm gonna 
have to miss a couple weeks' work, 

29:01.177 --> 29:03.348
but, for the most part, you'll be
 closed for the summer, anyway, so…

29:03.349 --> 29:06.362
Actually, that's not happening now.

29:06.363 --> 29:06.860
What?

29:06.861 --> 29:08.396
Yeah April and I aren't going away,

29:08.397 --> 29:09.800
 I mean at least not for most of the summer

29:09.801 --> 29:11.302
, so I'm gonna keep the diner open.

29:11.303 --> 29:13.387
Oh, man, that totally blows. What happened?

29:13.388 --> 29:16.377
Oh she's going to this camp -- this science camp. 

29:16.378 --> 29:17.851
You know she's super smart -- I mean like,

29:17.852 --> 29:20.652
 off-the-charts smart -- and she got invited, 

29:20.653 --> 29:24.010
and it's real prestigious. 
And she's got to go. She can't not go.

29:24.011 --> 29:25.389
Buddy, I'm so sorry.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.292
Oh, it's okay.

29:26.293 --> 29:29.210
- No I know how stoked you were for this trip.
- No it's all right Zach…

29:29.211 --> 29:31.601
- All that planning -- you were really into it.
- It's okay Zach.

29:31.602 --> 29:33.201
- No! It's not. It sucks.
- Zach.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.141
Okay, I'm sorry. I get it. You're processing.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.689
- Hey! Hey, babe.
- Hey. 

29:40.430 --> 29:43.019
- Hey, Luke!
- Lane, hey! It's been a little while.

29:43.020 --> 29:44.717
Yeah I know I can't believe 

29:44.718 --> 29:47.621
I'm actually out of the 
apartment at night and baby-free.

29:47.622 --> 29:49.889
 I feel like I'm missing a limb -- or two, actually.

29:49.890 --> 29:50.646
You look good.

29:50.647 --> 29:52.267
Thanks. I'm exhausted. 

29:52.268 --> 29:53.911
But psyched to be out on the town, right?

29:53.912 --> 29:56.586
So psyched. So are you coming to K.C.'s?

29:56.587 --> 29:57.666
Ah I don't think so.

29:57.967 --> 30:01.096
Dude, you've got to come. 
He just got some totally devastating news.

30:01.097 --> 30:02.737
It's actually not that bad.

30:02.738 --> 30:03.733
He's still processing.

30:04.300 --> 30:04.734
Luke, you should come

30:04.735 --> 30:06.555
Come on let me buy you a beer

30:06.556 --> 30:08.551
You know you guys, go ahead. Maybe I'll catch up.

30:08.552 --> 30:09.571
Okay. That's cool.

30:09.572 --> 30:11.535
- So, maybe we'll see you there.
- Sure.

30:18.925 --> 30:20.090
So, what was the news?

30:20.091 --> 30:22.926
- Oh. April bailed on the boat trip.
- Oh, no.

30:22.927 --> 30:26.168
Yeah she's going away to some 
brainiac science camp for the summer. 

30:26.169 --> 30:28.019
Who's even heard of science camp? 

30:28.020 --> 30:30.054
It's a contradiction in terms. It's like a…

30:30.055 --> 30:37.561
-Oxymoron.
- Oxymoron -- totally. Are you okay there, babe?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.630
Yeah, I just kind of realized something today.

30:40.631 --> 30:41.631
Yeah what's that?

30:42.300 --> 30:46.351
I realized I can't go on tour. 
I'd love to -- god, I'd love to -- 

30:46.352 --> 30:48.833
but it's just not possible -- not with two babies. 

30:48.834 --> 30:52.365
I mean, you know it's hard enough here at home, 

30:52.366 --> 30:53.664
where I have a whole support system -- 

30:53.665 --> 30:56.483
my mom and Brian and 
Dr. Shaw. I've got my routine,

30:56.484 --> 30:58.607
 and it's hard, but it's manageable. 

30:58.608 --> 31:01.000
But it wouldn't be anywhere but here, you know?

31:01.001 --> 31:03.606
- No, I get it. I do.
- I'm so sorry, Zach.

31:04.300 --> 31:07.050
You don't have to be sorry 
about anything. It makes sense. 

31:07.051 --> 31:08.962
It's cool. I'll call graham in the morning

31:08.963 --> 31:10.948
 and tell him we can't go. He'll understand.

31:10.949 --> 31:12.953
No. Wait. That's not what I'm saying. 

31:12.954 --> 31:15.018
I'm saying I can't go. I still want you to go.

31:15.019 --> 31:16.896
- You do?
- Hell, yeah.

31:17.097 --> 31:18.993
No way. Not without you and the boys.

31:20.158 --> 31:22.079
Zach, this is a really big opportunity.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.956
Yeah, but it's two months.

31:23.957 --> 31:26.887
Exactly. It's not a yearlong world tour.

31:26.888 --> 31:30.295
 It's two months, it's 
important, it's a dream come true, 

31:30.296 --> 31:31.765
and who knows where it could lead?

31:32.500 --> 31:33.303
Are you sure?

31:34.159 --> 31:37.147
I am. We'll talk all the time, 

31:37.148 --> 31:39.423
and I'll hold the phone up to Steve and Kwan's ears 

31:39.424 --> 31:40.353
so they can hear your voice. 

31:40.354 --> 31:43.819
I'll see your shows in
 New York and Philly and Boston. 

31:43.820 --> 31:45.243
We'll work this out.

31:48.723 --> 31:49.680
You are the coolest.

31:49.681 --> 31:53.509
Well, I am married to the lead guitarist of vapor rub.

32:19.564 --> 32:20.948
How you feeling there, mom?

32:20.949 --> 32:23.614
Ah I must be drunk, 'cause he sounds pretty good.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.961
Well, get those pipes 
warmed up, 'cause you're on deck.

32:26.962 --> 32:29.074
I can't follow Kirk. He can really sing!

32:37.200 --> 32:38.611
Come on, mom. If you don't, 

32:38.612 --> 32:41.000
then you're gonna ruin all this
 good cheering up you've been doing.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.543
You are relentless!

32:42.544 --> 32:44.702
I'm thinking something early Madonna.

32:45.550 --> 32:47.202
- Hey!
- Oh, Lane!

32:47.203 --> 32:48.577
What are you doing here?

32:48.578 --> 32:49.484
I'm just catching up with my mom.

32:49.485 --> 32:51.904
Hi, Lane. Hey what's up, Zach?

32:51.905 --> 32:53.185
Not much, Lorelai. How are you?

32:53.186 --> 32:54.842
Good. A little tipsy.

32:54.843 --> 32:56.476
Seems like an appropriate setting for that. 

32:57.477 --> 32:58.729
Okay, this is just sinful.

32:58.730 --> 32:59.317
Be nice.

32:59.318 --> 33:01.051
I'm just saying If you're gonna do Boy George, 

33:01.052 --> 33:02.793
at least commit to the high heels and the makeup.

33:02.794 --> 33:04.162
Hey, sit. Sit.

33:04.363 --> 33:09.841
- Okay. So, are you done with finals already? 
-Ah…

33:09.842 --> 33:11.126
Wait. Are you actually done with school?

33:11.127 --> 33:13.819
- Um not yet, very soon. I'll be done next week.
- Oh.

33:13.854 --> 33:15.901
Pretzels or peanuts?

33:15.902 --> 33:18.266
Oh, peanuts, and remember 
-- if you slip out the back door,

33:18.267 --> 33:19.503
 I will sink into a deep depression.

33:19.504 --> 33:20.386
Drat!

33:22.286 --> 33:23.857
So, how are the boys?

33:23.858 --> 33:28.102
Awesome, exhausting, amazing,
 infuriating. You name it, I feel it. 

33:28.103 --> 33:30.617
I'm gonna get a beer. Ginger ale for you, mom?

33:30.618 --> 33:31.644
- Sure.
- Rory?

33:31.645 --> 33:32.128
I'm good.

33:32.129 --> 33:32.960
Be right back.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.853
So, really, what's going on with you?

33:37.691 --> 33:40.531
Oh, I just had a bit of a meltdown, that's all.

33:40.532 --> 33:41.586
Why? What's going on?

33:41.787 --> 33:44.323
There's this job that 
I really wanted, and I didn't get it. 

33:44.324 --> 33:47.078
I was pretty bummed about 
it, but my mom talked me down, 

33:47.079 --> 33:49.877
and everything's fine now.
 What's going on with you?

33:49.878 --> 33:53.034
Well, Zach is going on a 2-month tour this summer 

33:53.035 --> 33:56.344
as the lead guitarist of 
Vapor Rub, and, yes, I'm serious.

33:56.345 --> 33:58.454
Vapor Rub? Whatever happened to Hep Alien?

33:58.455 --> 34:01.028
Well, Hep Alien will live to rock again, 

34:01.029 --> 34:02.696
but right now, opportunity calls.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.074
Isn't it gonna be hard for you guys to be apart?

34:05.075 --> 34:07.567
Definitely, but, you know, it's only two months

34:07.568 --> 34:09.706
. And we'll make it work. Life is long.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.405
When did you get so mature?

34:11.406 --> 34:14.813
I think the mature gene kicks
 in once you become a mother.

34:39.096 --> 34:41.813
Honey, it's another 
embarrassing moment for your diary. 

34:41.813 --> 34:47.250
 Uh-oh. 
 Happy graduation.

34:50.550 --> 35:01.928
If I... should stay 
I would only be in your way…

35:02.730 --> 35:03.663
She's a Whitney fan?

35:03.664 --> 35:05.623
Oh, I think it's Dolly-inspired.

35:05.624 --> 35:15.091
But I know I'll think of you
 each step of the way,

35:15.126 --> 35:22.415
- and I-I-I will always love you…
- She's all right!

35:22.416 --> 35:24.272
The kid's stealing our thunder!

35:24.273 --> 35:30.883
I will always love you. 

35:35.000 --> 35:40.632
Bittersweet memories, 

35:41.580 --> 35:54.262
that's all I'm taking with me, 
so goodbye please don't c-cry,

35:55.700 --> 36:10.427
We both know I'm not what you need,
and I will always love you,

36:11.655 --> 36:25.514
I will always love you.
I hope life treats you kind, 

36:25.515 --> 36:37.683
and I hope you have all you dreamed of, 
and I wish you joy and happiness,

36:39.098 --> 36:55.911
but above all I wish you love,
and I-I-I will always love you,

36:56.880 --> 37:11.772
I will always love you,
I will always... love you 

37:34.908 --> 37:37.083
- Morning.
- Coffee?

37:37.084 --> 37:40.168
Yeah. What are you doing up?
 Why aren't you more hung over?

37:40.169 --> 37:42.969
Well, I stopped drinking several shots before you did.

37:42.970 --> 37:43.852
Are you going?

37:44.053 --> 37:46.067
Yeah. I'm gonna stop by Lane's. 

37:46.068 --> 37:47.807
Then I have to get back to school and 

37:47.808 --> 37:49.086
start studying for my next final.

37:49.087 --> 37:51.222
 This time, I intend on turning in all my blue books.

37:51.223 --> 37:54.013
That's too bad. I had a whole 
second day of pick-me-up plans,

37:54.014 --> 37:56.424
 including a clown and some pony rides 

37:56.425 --> 37:58.199
and absolutely no drinking at all.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.500
Well then you shouldn't have devised such an 

37:59.501 --> 38:01.088
effective first-day pick-me-up plan.

38:01.815 --> 38:02.613
Well, live and learn.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.176
I really do feel better, though -- 

38:04.177 --> 38:06.170
all the wallowing and the eating and the shopping. 

38:06.171 --> 38:09.488
And I don't know maybe it's 
because you wished me joy and happiness.

38:09.489 --> 38:11.493
You liked that, huh?

38:11.494 --> 38:12.457
It cheered me up.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.343
Well, glad it did.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.315
I do feel so much better, though. 

38:16.316 --> 38:18.127
It's like you said -- sometimes 

38:18.128 --> 38:19.409
you just have to let your feelings out.

38:19.410 --> 38:22.134
Yeah. Sometimes you do. 

38:25.182 --> 38:27.055
- Chilaquiles, huh?
- Chilaquiles.

38:27.056 --> 38:28.330
People went nuts for them. 

38:28.331 --> 38:30.558
Mr. And Mrs. Fiss said they 
want them every morning now. 

38:30.559 --> 38:32.620
Who knew? I didn't even think we'd sell one of them.

38:32.621 --> 38:34.713
Well it was all Caesar -- his idea, his recipe, 

38:34.714 --> 38:36.417
his refusal to take no for an answer.

38:36.418 --> 38:38.284
Hey, Caesar. Chilaquiles!

38:38.285 --> 38:41.284
- Chilaquiles! What'd I tell you, Luke?
- You told me, Caesar. 

38:41.285 --> 38:41.928
I told you.

38:41.929 --> 38:43.243
You also told me you told me.

38:43.244 --> 38:44.043
Chilaquiles!

38:45.780 --> 38:46.948
That dude's a riot. 

38:46.949 --> 38:48.253
Hey I'm glad you came out last night.

38:48.254 --> 38:49.274
Yeah, it was fun.

38:49.275 --> 38:50.696
Gypsy does a mean Pat Benatar.

38:50.697 --> 38:51.891
That was interesting.

38:51.892 --> 38:53.183
- How about Lorelai?
- Huh?

38:54.150 --> 38:55.516
- What did you think?
- Oh, uh...

38:55.517 --> 38:57.421
I mean the gal can sing, right? 

38:57.422 --> 38:59.698
Bizarro choice of tune, but she's got some pipes. 

38:59.699 --> 39:00.546
Nice quality, you know?

39:00.547 --> 39:02.211
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.250
So you feeling better? 

39:04.251 --> 39:06.158
Nah you still bumming 
about your boat trip, aren't you? 

39:06.159 --> 39:07.506
Of course you are. Why am I asking?

39:07.507 --> 39:10.704
No, no, no, it's okay. 
I'm actually feeling a little better.

39:10.705 --> 39:13.187
 And you know hanging around 
here this summer might not be so bad.

39:13.488 --> 39:14.159
That's cool. 

39:14.160 --> 39:17.276
Maybe we can make karaoke 
night at K.C.'s kind of a regular thing.

39:17.277 --> 39:18.229
Yeah, maybe.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.355
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.458
 In the middle of breakfast rush, I found your hat. 

39:21.459 --> 39:22.861
It was wedged in behind the dishwasher. 

39:22.862 --> 39:24.416
- No worse for the wear, though.
- Yeah thanks.

39:24.417 --> 39:25.782
Yeah I told you it'd turn up.

39:43.040 --> 39:51.969
- Just a minute! Oh, hey.
- Hey.

39:51.970 --> 39:54.499
Oh, you just missed Rory. 
She's on her way back to school.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.858
I know, I'm actually here to see you.

39:56.605 --> 39:57.780
Oh. Okay. Come on in.

39:57.781 --> 39:58.661
Thank you.

40:01.130 --> 40:04.507
Do you want, um, any food or 
drink? I ordered way too many fries.

40:04.508 --> 40:05.796
No, thanks. I'm all good.

40:05.797 --> 40:13.480
Here, have a seat. 
Paul Anka! Um... so, how was your trip?

40:13.481 --> 40:14.327
Oh, it was really great. 

40:14.328 --> 40:15.605
Actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

40:15.606 --> 40:17.418
Oh, god. I know nothing about that world.

40:17.419 --> 40:20.049
 Apple, IBM, Microsoft…I'm out.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.148
Well, I've been offered a position
 with an emerging internet company.

40:24.700 --> 40:25.761
Wow, that's great.

40:25.762 --> 40:27.643
Yeah it's pretty similar
 to what I was doing in New York, 

40:27.644 --> 40:29.762
but actually they're willing 
to make me a full partner. 

40:29.763 --> 40:31.112
I'll be getting in on the ground floor.

40:32.100 --> 40:32.851
That's exciting!

40:32.852 --> 40:34.557
It is. It's gonna be a lot of long hours and 

40:34.558 --> 40:36.363
an incredible amount of work building the company,

40:36.364 --> 40:38.808
 but I really feel this venture has a bright future.

40:38.809 --> 40:40.689
 I mean, these are serious people.

40:40.690 --> 40:44.831
And you're a serious guy. 
Look, you don't have to convince me. 

40:44.832 --> 40:47.864
I voiced my concerns, and you told me your plans. 

40:47.865 --> 40:49.343
We had pie. I'm cool.

40:49.344 --> 40:51.961
Thank you. I appreciate
 that. That means a lot to me.

40:52.600 --> 40:53.730
Oh. You're welcome.

40:55.300 --> 40:58.858
So, the thing is -- as you can imagine, 

40:58.859 --> 40:59.835
I'm pretty excited about all this.

40:59.836 --> 41:00.974
Y-yeah.

41:00.975 --> 41:05.664
But it does mean a move to
 San Francisco -- Palo Alto, actually.

41:05.665 --> 41:07.842
- Oh, wow. 
- Yeah.

41:07.843 --> 41:10.314
That's big. That's funny that Rory didn't mention it.

41:10.315 --> 41:11.630
Well actually, I haven't told her yet.

41:12.735 --> 41:15.315
And you're here 'cause
 you want me to tell her for you?

41:15.316 --> 41:17.078
No, no. I'm gonna tell her. 

41:17.079 --> 41:20.132
I just um, I wanted to talk to you first about it.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.262
 Okay. That's...thoughtful.

41:25.636 --> 41:32.421
Look... I love Rory. She means the world to me, 

41:32.422 --> 41:37.107
- and I want her to come with me to California.
- Oh.

41:37.750 --> 41:40.819
But not just as my 
girlfriend, which is why I'm here.

41:43.050 --> 41:44.165
 I'm here to ask your permission -- 

41:44.750 --> 41:46.654
your permission to ask Rory to marry me.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.655
Lorelai? Lorelai?

41:54.305 --> 42:00.483
