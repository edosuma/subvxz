00:00.668 --> 00:03.202
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:05.137
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:05.138 --> 00:07.071
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:07.074 --> 00:09.141
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:09.142 --> 00:11.209
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:13.379
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:17.483
I want the slides first.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.618
Then we show them the stills.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.221
And the miniatures
are the knockout punch.

00:22.223 --> 00:26.025
Damn.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.159
We're already late.
And the traffic...

00:27.161 --> 00:28.293
I better call.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.028
Peter,
pull the car around

00:29.030 --> 00:30.229
and meet me

00:30.231 --> 00:31.630
at the gate.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.370
Damn.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.573
Four quarters, please.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.342
I'm not supposed to...

00:43.344 --> 00:45.377
Look, I'm in a rush.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.297
Yeah, it's Moskowitz.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.132
Tell him 15 minutes.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.268
I know.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.370
15 minutes guaranteed.

01:18.312 --> 01:25.384
(<i> tires screeching</i> )

01:30.391 --> 01:31.590
You okay?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.158
Yeah.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.209
(<i> screams</i> )

01:53.647 --> 01:56.115
Miss Moskowitz?

02:01.255 --> 02:02.321
I'm okay.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.722
Take your time.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.725
Uh... I'd just hung up
on the phone

02:06.727 --> 02:09.461
and I didn't see the car.

02:09.463 --> 02:13.298
I told Peter and Craig
to bring it around,

02:13.300 --> 02:15.534
so I went looking...

02:17.738 --> 02:19.738
There was this van--

02:19.740 --> 02:22.341
nearly clipped me
on the way out.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.376
What color was the van?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.712
Uh, gray, or maybe silver.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.280
Big.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.548
How about the driver?

02:29.550 --> 02:32.284
Did you get a look at him?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.285
Barely.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.553
A white guy.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.355
I don't know.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.923
Then I found them.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.727
You said there was
a woman-- a brunette?

02:41.729 --> 02:43.228
Uh-huh.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.397
I don't know
where she went.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.604
Dude was doing
at least 35.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.540
He busted
through the gate.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.375
Mr. Rozakis got a partial
on the plates.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.476
The APB's already out.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.644
Would you recognize him?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.996
I never saw him.

03:00.997 --> 03:03.347
A machine gives the ticket, he's
supposed to pay on the way out.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.683
He's probably
halfway to Canada by now.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.386
Sure.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.687
The plates were Canadian.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.689
I told him that.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.424
<i> "Je me souviens."</i>

03:12.426 --> 03:14.193
"I remember"--

03:14.195 --> 03:16.395
the motto on
the Quebec plates.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.564
There's a lot of Greeks
in Canada.

03:18.566 --> 03:22.234
I got uncles, cousins
in Montreal, Toronto.

03:22.236 --> 03:26.371
Oh, on the van, the bumper...

03:26.373 --> 03:30.542
There's a, uh, a sticker
that says Tilford Rentals.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.378
They're like the Hertz
of Canada.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.813
That's it?

03:34.815 --> 03:37.416
Yeah.

03:37.418 --> 03:41.220
Listen, you remember
anything else, give us a buzz.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.387
Sure.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.622
So, Sammy, tell us.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.258
It's two shots each,
to the heart.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.359
What did they take?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.560
Nothing.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.996
One's got on a $1,000 Piaget
on his wrist.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.732
No powder burns,
no defensive wounds.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.835
They got it from ten... 15 feet,
at least.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.371
Four shots,

03:59.373 --> 04:01.707
probably silenced,
right through the heart.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.475
A marksman.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.710
A pro.

05:06.307 --> 05:10.042
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

05:29.797 --> 05:34.066
You're telling me a pro
rents a van in Montreal,

05:34.068 --> 05:35.367
drives 500 miles

05:35.369 --> 05:38.036
and in the open,
guns down two ad men?

05:38.038 --> 05:39.504
Disgruntled client maybe.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.806
Witnesses?

05:40.808 --> 05:41.907
Nothing we can use.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.376
We got a hit
on the APB.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.911
Traffic towed a gray van,

05:45.913 --> 05:48.380
Canadian plates,
corner of 33rd and Eighth.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.815
That's the post office.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.384
What's he going to do--
mail himself to Canada?

05:52.386 --> 05:53.885
He'd be more comfortable
on the train.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.554
The station.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.621
No backup.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.890
If he smells a uniform,
he's gone.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.494
The 11:30 train leaving
for Trenton, New Jersey

06:02.496 --> 06:03.962
on track three.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.504
Hey. Montreal train--
what track?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.505
Track eight.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.574
Departs in 15.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.611
(<i> train whistle blowing</i> )

06:19.613 --> 06:21.847
(<i> bell ringing</i> )

06:40.601 --> 06:42.434
CERRETA:
Six down, two to go.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.407
There you go.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.609
Thank you.

06:56.683 --> 06:57.682
Going to Montreal?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.651
Are you going to Montreal?

06:59.653 --> 07:00.852
Yes.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.687
Can I see your ticket?

07:02.689 --> 07:03.955
Vacation?

07:03.957 --> 07:06.558
Don't you guys have
anything better...

07:06.560 --> 07:08.560
Look, just tell her
I already mailed the check.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.498
My friend.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.134
Hey.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.420
Forget something?

07:18.421 --> 07:20.705
Thanks. I had a little
too much coffee today.

07:20.707 --> 07:21.706
It will keep.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.708
Mind if we look in here?

07:23.710 --> 07:24.709
Can I stop you?

07:24.711 --> 07:26.711
We could get a warrant.

07:26.713 --> 07:30.048
Then you wouldn't want
to miss your train.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.454
Put your hands right
on top of your head.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.659
You're under arrest;
anything you say

07:40.660 --> 07:42.727
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.001
How many times we going
to go through this?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.236
Mr. Kemp,

07:51.238 --> 07:52.237
what do you say
we call your lawyer?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.472
No reason to.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.006
I didn't do anything.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.610
You had a semiautomatic
with a fully loaded clip.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.678
So I had a piece.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.580
So I was a naughty boy.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.248
I'll pay the two bucks.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.684
I'm thinking
it was a murder weapon.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.252
I'm happy for you.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.587
Okay if I smoke?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.622
Mike.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.723
Mike.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.993
Want some coffee?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.761
Let's have some coffee.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.498
Yeah.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.704
Cream, no sugar.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.745
We're doing all the talking.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.047
A little leverage
wouldn't hurt.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.517
We hit on ballistics,
it's over.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.985
Did you check his yellows?

08:39.987 --> 08:41.653
Yeah. Six arrests--

08:41.655 --> 08:44.122
from gun possession
to attempt.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.757
No convictions.

08:45.759 --> 08:49.761
A van rented in your name
was spotted at the scene.

08:49.763 --> 08:53.698
It was found three blocks
from where we found you.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.233
The van was stolen.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.236
I stopped at some diner
on 46th and Lex.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.672
It was not there
when I came out.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.673
You reported it?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.675
To who?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.710
The police?
The rental company?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.779
All of the above.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.214
What's the big deal?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.715
This the first car stolen
in the city?

09:10.717 --> 09:15.220
Mr. Kemp, you live in
Plattsburgh, upstate New York.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.254
What's that?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.689
An hour outside Montreal?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.157
45 minutes.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.693
You went that far
to rent a van?

09:21.695 --> 09:24.596
I'm not rolling in the bucks,
like you guys.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.997
Exchange rate,
no per mile.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.265
I save a bundle.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.668
Why did you need a van?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.703
My mother.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.706
She owns
this great old clock--

09:34.708 --> 09:35.707
a Seth Thomas.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.160
Some dealer

09:38.161 --> 09:40.612
on the west side
offered me five grand for it.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.613
Dealer's name?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.715
In the van.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.050
With the clock.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.253
You always take a semiautomatic

09:48.255 --> 09:50.722
and an eight-inch blade
on a trip?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.257
What do you want?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.725
It's New York.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.161
Yeah.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.163
Mike, labs you ordered.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.264
And?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.665
Negative.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.602
Gun in his bag
didn't kill our guys.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.604
The bastard knew it
all along.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.606
Different story on the knife.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.608
Minute traces of human blood
of recent origin.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.610
I thought
these guys were shot.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.611
They were.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.612
Well, great.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.614
That's great.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.615
So we got two stiffs
with no murder weapon

10:17.618 --> 10:20.685
and a bloody knife
with no victim. Great.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.120
Standard pop and hop--

10:22.122 --> 10:24.723
effective, but impacts
the resale value.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.293
So Kemp makes like
someone took his van.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.629
He knows
how to throw curves.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.697
He's a consummate pro.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.700
This is the address
of an antique dealer.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.769
He's good. Covers all bases.
Establishes an alibi.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.771
Why not ditch the knife?

10:39.773 --> 10:42.641
You can't match a knife
like a bullet.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.775
Waste not, want not.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.910
Everyone gets hit
by the recession.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.912
You got recent
gunpowder residue.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.914
I'll bring it to the lab.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.916
At least we know
we got the right van.

10:51.918 --> 10:55.153
That doesn't put Kemp
in the driver's seat.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.721
You feel like a doughnut?

10:56.723 --> 10:57.889
Yeah.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.192
150 bagels a day,
all with cream cheese

11:01.194 --> 11:04.429
and this turnip
wants peanut butter.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.930
Was that yesterday?

11:05.932 --> 11:08.933
Sits there doing the puzzle
for an hour.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.201
I live on tips--
little he cares.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.203
What goes around comes around.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.305
What do you mean?

11:14.307 --> 11:18.677
He leaves, comes running back
looking for a phone.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.444
Someone stole his car.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.681
Serves him right.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.349
You ever work a counter?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.684
No.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.452
Michelle Pfeiffer
could be sitting there.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.787
You wouldn't know.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.689
They don't look at faces.

11:30.691 --> 11:34.359
A waitress here probably
serves 100 breakfasts a day.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.760
She remembered<i> him.</i>

11:35.762 --> 11:37.362
Because he
wanted her to.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.231
How come our two guys
rate a pro?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.233
Were they involved in something?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.935
That's what we're trying

11:43.937 --> 11:45.937
to find out,
Miss Moskowitz.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.373
Can you tell us
about their lives

11:48.375 --> 11:49.808
outside the office?

11:49.810 --> 11:52.977
Craig Hovis
was like a plow horse.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.246
He was here all the time.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.848
What about the family?

11:56.850 --> 11:57.849
From Phoenix.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.384
No family in town.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.819
And Coyle?

12:00.821 --> 12:04.723
Peter was a different story.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.759
Freelanced until I convinced him
to come aboard.

12:07.761 --> 12:11.996
To Peter, corporate America
was up there with root canal.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.965
But you turned him around?

12:13.967 --> 12:19.437
Well, money can't buy love,
but it helps.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.475
Coyle--
was he all work as well?

12:23.477 --> 12:27.479
Peter was an artist.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.483
He breathed life
into every frame.

12:31.485 --> 12:35.386
I'd finally convinced him
to show his portraits.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.423
I have a friend
who has a gallery in Soho.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.426
So I take it that
you talked to Peter

12:41.428 --> 12:43.762
about things
other than work?

12:43.764 --> 12:48.500
We just started seeing
each other...

12:48.502 --> 12:50.034
dating.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.339
Was he the one?

13:03.784 --> 13:06.785
Looks like Coyle
had a more interesting life

13:06.787 --> 13:07.919
than the plow horse.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.921
Nobody had
a piece of this guy.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.790
63 G's in a money market.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.459
Another 50 and change
in a retirement fund.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.261
Hardly worth killing for.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.798
<i>Esquire, Hockey News.</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:22.567
Tax deductibles:

13:22.569 --> 13:27.539
Greenpeace,
United Way, Jerry's Kids.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.341
Ah, card from Moskowitz.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.344
These guys
look like Boy Scouts.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.815
Yeah, with shadow lives.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.951
Somebody paid good money
to get them dead.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.486
Dig deep enough,

13:41.488 --> 13:43.588
something pops out
of the shadows.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.324
None of the usuals play--
mob, drugs.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.259
Who else hires a hitter?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.394
Jealous husband.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.829
Both of them?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.598
Maybe Mr. Plow Horse
was dunking his doughnut

13:53.600 --> 13:55.366
in somebody else's coffee.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.601
Husband gets a whiff.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.069
Doesn't like the smell.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.070
And Coyle?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.839
Wrong place, wrong time.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.309
Innocent bystander
slash witness.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.376
Hold it.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.579
What if they both
had bad timing?

14:07.581 --> 14:08.613
Phil, I was kidding.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.048
Hear me out.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.517
The guy in the lot and Moskowitz

14:12.519 --> 14:14.285
said there was another woman.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.553
She got there

14:15.555 --> 14:16.855
before Hovis and Coyle.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.989
The brunette.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.959
She went in,
but no one saw her go out.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.627
Kemp has a bloody knife.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.630
So Kemp's doing the brunette
with the knife.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.399
Coyle and Hovis see him
<i> in flagrante.</i>

14:28.401 --> 14:29.634
It's bang, bang.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.569
She went to the lot.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.538
Why? To get her car.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.440
It's still got to be there.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.010
My boss says
nobody stays long-term.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.578
But you're a nice guy.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.880
Live and let live.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.549
I can use the extra cash--
new VCR.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.551
This is Mr. Simmons--
a lawyer.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.554
Friday, he says,
"I'll be gone about six days."

14:49.556 --> 14:50.989
"Anyone wants to take it,
let them-- it's insured."

14:50.991 --> 14:52.957
Next.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.426
This one's been here
a few days-- after 48 hours,

14:55.428 --> 14:59.430
I'm supposed to have them towed,
but she's a nice lady.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.900
She say she
would be out of town?

15:01.902 --> 15:02.901
Not to me.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.469
She have a name?

15:04.471 --> 15:05.570
Not that I know of.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.039
She's in here
all the time though.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.507
Mike, look.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.976
Paint's scratched
to the bare metal.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.979
Someone wanted to get
in there real bad.

15:14.981 --> 15:18.416
It looks like someone else
wanted it that way.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.419
There's a toothpick
or matchstick stuck in there.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.587
Okay.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.541
Janet Torrens.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.543
Sixth Street,
Brooklyn, New York.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.078
27 years old.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.547
Does that say
Miss or Mrs.?

15:49.549 --> 15:52.116
I was just thinking,
maybe next time,

15:52.118 --> 15:55.086
I'd take her to see
the Knicks or something.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.721
I wouldn't hold my breath.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.328
Janet was out of work.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.330
I told her, why waste money?

16:05.332 --> 16:07.231
Your old room's empty.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.200
Last month,
she started looking

16:09.202 --> 16:10.435
for her own apartment.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.236
When did you see her last?

16:12.238 --> 16:13.638
What was it?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.541
Tuesday morning
before she left for the city.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.476
You haven't seen her
for two days?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.244
Janet's a grown woman.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.314
She lived here,
but we don't keep tabs on her.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.084
She was under a lot of stress.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.253
Mr. Torrens, does Janet
drive a red BMW?

16:29.255 --> 16:30.254
Yeah.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.489
She bought it used

16:31.491 --> 16:33.591
when she started working
in Manhattan.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.294
We found her car
in a parking lot.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.229
It's been there for 48 hours.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.464
Oh, God.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.265
It doesn't necessarily mean...

16:41.267 --> 16:42.200
I told her

16:42.202 --> 16:44.102
you keep your mouth shut.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.636
Jack, they
told us not to.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.338
Excuse me?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.339
The FBI...

16:48.341 --> 16:49.340
Jack!

16:49.342 --> 16:50.475
What the hell

16:50.477 --> 16:52.276
does it matter now?

16:52.278 --> 16:56.114
They're investigating that bum
she used to work for--

16:56.116 --> 16:57.415
Charles Martine.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.484
Illegal contracts
or something.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.419
And Janet was
helping them?

17:01.421 --> 17:02.420
Yeah.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.122
CERRETA:
Who's the agent?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.223
Blanchard.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.624
We called him
last night.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.226
He said not to worry.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.728
She's left before
for a couple of days

17:10.730 --> 17:12.330
without telling us.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.333
Why would she leave
her car in the city

17:15.335 --> 17:16.801
if she went to the island?

17:21.341 --> 17:23.341
All off the record, right?

17:23.343 --> 17:26.477
Charles Martine--
as in<i> The United States v.</i>

17:26.479 --> 17:28.246
Any bells going off?

17:28.248 --> 17:30.432
Military contractor.

17:30.433 --> 17:32.617
Built Martine Aeronautics
from the ground up.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.254
Sells the Air Force on
a sophisticated guidance system,

17:36.256 --> 17:37.522
million bucks a plane.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.341
Scam?

17:39.342 --> 17:41.159
Underbids everybody,
delivers substandard goods.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.161
U.S. Attorney calls it fraud.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.164
Maybe some flyboy's widow
calls it murder.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.399
Mr. Martine is
currently awaiting trial

17:48.401 --> 17:51.169
in the no-bail suite at MCC.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.671
Indictment's got more counts
than Nixon had plumbers.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.990
What about Janet Torrens?

17:55.991 --> 17:58.308
Miss Torrens was Martine's
bookkeeper for five years.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.610
The past seven months

17:59.612 --> 18:01.612
confidential
government informant.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.481
You have something on her?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.249
She came to us.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.717
Young lady has guts.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.420
The kind you don't
see much anymore.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.523
I really hope you guys
are wrong about this.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.292
I liked this one.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.261
You'll let me know, huh?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.301
I never heard of Janet Torrens.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.304
The blood on your knife
was type O--

18:26.306 --> 18:27.572
same as Janet Torrens.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.573
Same as me.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.308
Does the name
Charles Martine

18:30.310 --> 18:31.709
mean anything to you?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.344
I never heard of him.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.280
What's the deal,
are you going

18:35.281 --> 18:37.215
to walk me through
the whole phone book?

18:37.217 --> 18:40.518
Janet Torrens was working
mornings as a temp

18:40.520 --> 18:43.621
two blocks from where
the car was found.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.857
She'd been there
three weeks.

18:45.859 --> 18:49.227
She was about to blow
the whistle on Martine.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.261
He hires Kemp.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.330
Hovis and Coyle
got in the way.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.332
Without the girl's body,
it's a stretch.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.468
The bottom line is she's
been missing since Tuesday,

18:57.470 --> 18:58.736
her car was ten feet

18:58.738 --> 19:01.372
from where Hovis
and Coyle took a bath

19:01.374 --> 19:03.608
and Kemp's van
was at the scene.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.843
The real bottom line is,
we can't put them

19:05.845 --> 19:08.346
in the same place
at the same time.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.881
You need physical evidence
to connect it all.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.750
A team is searching
his place in Plattsburgh.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.485
Give us a couple of days.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.853
Kemp's lawyer
is screaming

19:15.855 --> 19:17.355
about the delay.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.623
Buy us a couple.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.625
We will make
the connection.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.660
Martine's in a federal pen.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.496
It will take a day
to get to see him.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.265
I ought to be able to get

19:27.267 --> 19:29.500
some mileage out of the gun.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.669
Possession three,
he'll walk before lunch.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.539
Ben broke his wrist this morning
playing tennis.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.441
Maybe I can use that
to postpone the arraignment.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.310
He what?

19:39.312 --> 19:42.313
He dove for a lob.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.282
He finally beat you, huh?

19:44.284 --> 19:47.485
He was up, five-four.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.691
MARTINE:
<i>deals me a faulty board.</i>

19:53.693 --> 19:56.627
I pass it on
to the Air Force.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.746
Is that my fault?

19:58.747 --> 20:00.864
Mr. Martine's dealings
with the federal government

20:00.867 --> 20:02.900
were strictly legitimate.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.902
It will come out
in the trial.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.537
What about Janet Torrens?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.939
She was my bookkeeper.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.540
Was?

20:09.542 --> 20:10.942
Feds start investigating

20:10.944 --> 20:13.544
people nose around,
production stops.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.313
No books to keep.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.849
Your bookkeeper goes bye-bye

20:17.850 --> 20:20.384
and two guys are found dead
next to her car the same day.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.652
Makes you wonder.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.322
Are you accusing Mr. Martine
of murder?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.823
In case you haven't noticed

20:25.825 --> 20:28.559
I've been indisposed
for seven months.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.495
Your pal Frank Kemp
tells a different story.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.831
I never heard of him.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.766
If we find out you did

20:35.768 --> 20:38.402
you'll be more than indisposed
for the next 25 years.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.704
I promise you that.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.439
if you'd like.
Check his visitors list

20:41.441 --> 20:42.840
It's public record.

20:42.842 --> 20:47.411
If you want, I'll even open
his phone logs to you.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.814
Martine swears
he never heard of Frank Kemp.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.582
I know I believe him.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.585
As far as visitors go,
nothing in the last seven months

20:54.587 --> 20:56.854
except his attorney, Teasdale,
and his wife.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.107
Ditto with the phone.

20:59.108 --> 21:01.359
The only calls were
to Teasdale and the wife.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.727
He never called Frank Kemp.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.862
How 'bout we take it
from the other end.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.431
I'm sure our friends
at New York Telephone

21:07.433 --> 21:09.900
would be happy to supply us
with Mr. Kemp's usage details.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.871
No, thank you.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.539
Frank likes Chinese food.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.875
674 Prefix--
is that the East Village?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.010
Yeah.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.012
Frankie's got
a friend there.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.981
Five calls last week,
same number.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.420
What did people do before
they had answering machines?

21:29.422 --> 21:30.621
Cute voice.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.490
Maybe the girlfriend.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.958
Even hitters have a life.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.661
Reverse directory.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.895
I'll get the address.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.697
Yes.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.399
Is he in?

21:41.401 --> 21:43.434
No. It's personal.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.969
No message.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.004
The day before the shootings

21:47.006 --> 21:48.939
Frank Kemp chats
with a lawyer.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.007
27 minutes.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.876
The lawyer's name--
Larry Teasdale.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.745
As in Martine's mouthpiece.

21:56.549 --> 21:57.848
TEASDALE:
<i> So he called here.</i>

21:57.850 --> 21:59.884
<i> Doesn't mean</i> I<i> talked to him.</i>

21:59.886 --> 22:01.952
Maybe he's seeing my secretary.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.522
Does your secretary
live in the Village?

22:04.524 --> 22:05.656
Rockaways.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.192
Mr. Kemp calls here

22:08.193 --> 22:10.727
the day before the key witness
against your client disappears.

22:10.730 --> 22:14.031
The world's getting smaller
every day, Mr. Teasdale.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.766
I'm really backed up today.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.769
Maybe we could continue this
some other time.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.004
You're also a suspect.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.840
Accessory to murder,
three counts.

22:22.842 --> 22:23.941
Fine.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.944
Then if you want
to speak to me again

22:26.946 --> 22:29.680
hit my lawyer with a subpoena.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.816
Law degree,
it's a license to lie.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.551
Even if we get a subpoena,

22:33.553 --> 22:34.819
he's gonna hide
behind privilege.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.053
Not if Kemp told him
beforehand

22:36.055 --> 22:38.055
he was going
to commit a crime.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.657
I'll call Robinette.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.592
Let's stop
in the Village first.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.894
Could be Kemp's honey
doesn't have a law degree.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.663
I don't know Frank Kemp.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.865
He called you five times
last week.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.700
That doesn't mean
I talked to him.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.068
Miss McManus,
Frank Kemp is suspected

22:51.070 --> 22:53.704
in the murder
of three people.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.973
I told you
I don't know him.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.074
I'm in a hurry.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.709
Get this right.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.813
You're not going anywhere
till you talk to us.

23:05.985 --> 23:10.921
I went out with the guy
a couple of times, okay?

23:10.923 --> 23:13.724
Now the jerk
won't leave me alone.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.727
LOGAN:
What's the matter?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.563
You don't like
to pick up your messages?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.999
CERRETA:
We don't mind.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.768
Go ahead.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.837
Here, let me help you out.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.710
It's Larry Teasdale.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.945
If you're listening, pick up.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.615
Call me as soon as possible.

23:37.617 --> 23:41.051
I'll be at the office,
and don't talk to anyone.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.754
Larry Teasdale

23:43.756 --> 23:46.924
everybody's favorite middleman.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.962
Teasdale called.
What did he want?

23:51.964 --> 23:53.097
How should I know?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.999
Frankie must have
given my number.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.085
That's who he's looking for.

23:57.086 --> 23:59.170
The dial went off the meter
an hour ago.

23:59.172 --> 24:00.471
Kemp is in jail.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.472
Teasdale knows it.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.207
He was looking for you.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.110
I don't know anything about it.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.012
I want to get out of here.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.079
You're not under arrest.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.215
You can leave anytime you want.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.718
Next time Teasdale calls

24:13.719 --> 24:16.220
ask him how much he charges
to draw up a will.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.892
Hope she brought
a change of underwear.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.027
Scared is good.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.228
Give it a minute.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.565
She doesn't look like a player.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.767
But she knows
everybody involved.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.906
I just met him.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.475
Teasdale?

24:37.477 --> 24:38.876
Kemp.

24:38.878 --> 24:44.148
A couple of months ago...
at a club... downtown.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.883
The guy wore a suit.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.252
We got lit in the ladies room.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.187
He was rolling in it.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.522
Cocaine?

24:51.524 --> 24:52.623
Ever ask him

24:52.625 --> 24:54.925
where he got the money?

24:57.096 --> 25:00.197
All right, look, let me
be straight with you, okay?

25:00.199 --> 25:03.067
There's a woman
named Janet Torrens.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.070
She's missing.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.204
She's probably dead.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.007
You see where I'm going here?

25:12.211 --> 25:14.945
You want to join her,
be my guest.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.113
Okay.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.116
I thought he was dealing,
but that's all.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.852
I had no idea he killed people.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.954
Did he say
he killed Janet Torrens?

25:23.956 --> 25:26.123
I never heard
of Janet Torrens until today.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.225
What about Charles Martine?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.594
All I know is I get a call
from some lawyer calls.

25:30.596 --> 25:31.962
Teasdale.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.597
He says Frankie's knee-deep.

25:33.599 --> 25:37.134
He says 25 grand is mine
if I cover for him--

25:37.136 --> 25:38.602
say we were together

25:38.604 --> 25:41.138
and that I dropped him
at the station.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.573
And you said?

25:42.575 --> 25:44.108
I said sure,

25:44.110 --> 25:48.112
but then I thought,
"I don't know these guys

25:48.114 --> 25:51.048
why should I
step in it for them?"

25:52.919 --> 25:54.919
Martine ordered the hit.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.121
Teasdale gave the contract
to Kemp.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.256
Conspiracy to commit
murder, three counts.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.292
Good. Get it on tape.

26:01.294 --> 26:02.326
And you...

26:02.328 --> 26:04.061
stay off those courts.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.229
Right.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.906
Frankie's okay?

26:15.908 --> 26:17.174
Fine.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.243
Getting better
with your help.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.612
He really messed up,
didn't he?

26:21.614 --> 26:23.614
All you need to know

26:23.616 --> 26:27.618
is that you will be helping
Frank out of a jam.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.054
If Frankie's done
something wrong...

26:30.056 --> 26:31.155
I don't know.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.691
I don't really like this.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.696
This should help ease the pain.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.070
25 G's--
that's a hell of an aspirin.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.639
This guy ought to reread
the ethics code.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.074
After the criminal code.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.176
You and Kemp
spent the day together

26:52.178 --> 26:54.178
you had a drink

26:54.180 --> 26:58.182
you hopped in the sack,
you took care of business

26:58.184 --> 27:02.086
and then you went with him
to the train station.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.188
I'm not
very good at this.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.024
For 25 thou,
you'd better be.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.398
Shall we?

27:14.400 --> 27:16.367
Be my guest.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.145
Is English
a second language?

27:28.147 --> 27:32.049
I thought I made it clear,
we have nothing to discuss.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.151
No discussion--
we talk, you listen.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.419
Larry Teasdale,
you're under arrest

27:35.421 --> 27:38.689
for bribery, tampering
with a witness and murder.

27:38.691 --> 27:42.092
I think the counselor
knows his rights.

27:42.094 --> 27:47.264
Case #26747,
People against Franklin Kemp

27:47.266 --> 27:49.767
Larry Teasdale
and Charles Martine.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.770
Charges are murder
in the second degree

27:52.772 --> 27:53.771
three counts.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.773
Conspiracy
to commit murder

27:55.775 --> 27:58.075
in the second degree,
bribery

27:58.077 --> 27:59.209
witness tampering.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.412
Have we got any pleas?

28:01.414 --> 28:03.247
Not guilty.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.314
Not guilty.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.784
Not guilty.

28:06.785 --> 28:09.253
So far so good-- Mr. Gold knows
how I don't like surprises.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.205
Keep me happy, Paul.

28:11.206 --> 28:13.156
Jail status continued
on Mr. Martine.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.293
$500,000 bail
on Mr. Teasdale and Mr. Kemp.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.327
So ordered.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.862
Wait, your honor...

28:18.864 --> 28:21.231
I'd love to chat, Mr. Gold,

28:21.233 --> 28:23.100
but I have a very full plate.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.201
Have a nice day.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.369
Keep them coming.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.338
BAILIFF:
Case #26748...

28:30.176 --> 28:33.077
We're in for a long trip.

28:33.079 --> 28:36.447
At the arraignment, Martine
was represented by Arthur Gold.

28:36.449 --> 28:39.116
He's almost legendary.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.385
He'll bury us in paper.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.253
He's all fizz and no gin.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.822
Sometimes fizz works.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.157
If you're referring
to the Jacobs case,

28:47.159 --> 28:48.425
that was six years ago.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.893
We were understaffed.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.428
Arthur Gold's laundry list

28:51.430 --> 28:54.098
of frivolous motions
was abusive.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.134
It was enough to get
the murder weapon suppressed.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.368
Enough to beat you.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.172
He wore out the judge.

29:02.174 --> 29:07.811
His last article for the<i> Journal</i>
was called "The Rule of M's"--

29:07.813 --> 29:10.214
Mountains of Motions
Multiply Mistakes.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.783
He said
no prosecutor could survive.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.119
We don't give him a chance.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.222
You cock enough triggers,
one pistol has to go off.

29:18.224 --> 29:21.492
Between Kemp and Teasdale,
one of them will roll

29:21.494 --> 29:24.762
and they'll all go away
for a very long time.

29:24.764 --> 29:27.481
Maybe not.

29:27.482 --> 29:30.199
Teasdale and Kemp are
represented by Gold's shadows--

29:30.202 --> 29:31.301
Styger and Werner.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.770
So?

29:32.772 --> 29:36.273
Schedule Werner at 2:00
and Styger at 4:00.

29:42.815 --> 29:46.817
The case against your client
is stronger than it appears.

29:46.819 --> 29:51.255
The van, the knife and the tape
should paint a clear picture

29:51.257 --> 29:53.107
for a jury.

29:53.108 --> 29:54.958
What is this--
a courtesy update?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.795
I want the man
who hired your client.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.264
You give me
Charles Martine...

30:00.266 --> 30:02.132
And you'll give me a medal?

30:02.134 --> 30:03.967
No. Man one, one count.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.236
15 minimum?

30:06.238 --> 30:08.138
I'd rather roll the dice.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.874
That's fine, but they'll come up
murder two, three counts.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.509
25 to life on each.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.178
Teasdale's tape

30:14.180 --> 30:16.180
has nothing to do with Mr. Kemp.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.548
The van was reported stolen

30:17.550 --> 30:20.450
the blood on the knife
matches that of what?

30:20.452 --> 30:22.452
Four million people
in New York.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.888
Including Janet Torrens.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.224
And you can't
produce a body.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.159
You rest your case.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.228
I move to dismiss.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.299
My client
would have surrendered.

30:35.301 --> 30:38.902
The humiliation of a public
arrest was hardly called for.

30:38.904 --> 30:42.973
I missed the Emily Post chapter
on the etiquette of arrest.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.175
Ben, I thought we were friends.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.245
Once a year, we co-chair a bar
association committee.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.214
Friends? I don't think so.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.249
You're serious about this?

30:52.251 --> 30:53.917
About the bribery, yes, I am.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.770
Alleged bribery.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.622
And the murder of Janet Torrens,
Craig Hovis and Peter Coyle.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.626
You're going away
for a long time, Larry.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.228
Don't be stupid twice.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.863
Don't go down alone.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.298
Give me Charles Martine.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
We'll work something out.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.903
Dealing's
a two-way street.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.038
There's nothing you can give me.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.908
You'll never make a case
against my client.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.043
It's all on tape, Miss Styger.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.245
I've got witnesses.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.646
You've got<i> Hamad</i> problems.

31:22.648 --> 31:26.283
Miss McManus was acting
as an agent of the police

31:26.285 --> 31:28.252
when she spoke with my client.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.638
So?

31:30.639 --> 31:33.023
The last time he spoke
with your men in blue--

31:33.025 --> 31:33.991
Cerreta and Logan--

31:33.993 --> 31:36.326
he told them in the future

31:36.328 --> 31:38.495
they should speak
with his lawyer.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.331
I assure you,
I got no calls.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.301
Your precious tape
doesn't get near a jury

31:44.303 --> 31:47.337
and without it,
you've got diddly.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.906
She's got a point.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.440
Under the<i> Hamad</i> decision

31:50.442 --> 31:52.476
if Teasdale asked
for an attorney

31:52.478 --> 31:54.478
it wouldn't make
any difference

31:54.480 --> 31:58.515
if he confessed to shooting
22 people in a Houston automat.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.983
The tape is worthless.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.286
Gold's orchestrating
their joint defense--

32:02.288 --> 32:03.954
nobody talks,
everybody walks.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.056
We still got McManus, she can
testify without the tape.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.258
Is she credible?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.993
It can go either way.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.929
Then I wouldn't bet heavy.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.597
A cross
by Arthur Gold...

32:13.599 --> 32:16.466
Arthur gold doesn't leap tall
buildings in a single bound.

32:16.468 --> 32:21.104
Nine of ten cases
are won without an eyewitness

32:21.106 --> 32:23.373
and Martine, Kemp, and Teasdale
in the courtroom--

32:23.375 --> 32:25.442
the circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.444
That will get you to the door.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.447
It's a toss-up
if it will get you inside.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.683
Have you tried dealing
with all three?

32:32.685 --> 32:34.618
Charles Martine
started the ball rolling.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.988
There's no way
I'd deal with that man.

32:37.990 --> 32:41.291
If you made it worth his while--
one count, man one

32:41.293 --> 32:43.560
with the sentence
to run concurrently

32:43.562 --> 32:46.296
with his federal time,
he'll have to talk.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.533
It's worth it if you
get Kemp and Teasdale.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.001
Without Janet Torrens's body

32:51.003 --> 32:53.003
Martine might
not do federal time

32:53.005 --> 32:55.038
and he's the most culpable.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.141
It's not our duty to determine
relative culpability.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.444
Martine rolls,
all three go to jail.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.112
But not for murder.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.349
Is it you don't want
to deal with Martine

33:05.351 --> 33:06.683
or is it Gold?

33:06.685 --> 33:09.019
Gold's got
nothing to do with it.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.355
Then you'll talk to him.

33:13.726 --> 33:16.426
Is that an order?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.032
Man one?

33:22.034 --> 33:23.400
Don't insult me, Ben.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.668
All right.

33:24.670 --> 33:28.171
If Charles Martine
gives us Kemp and Teasdale

33:28.173 --> 33:30.040
one count, man two.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.775
The sentence runs concurrently

33:31.777 --> 33:33.110
with his federal time.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.679
Janet Torrens
is nowhere to be found.

33:35.681 --> 33:39.149
I doubt there's going
to be a federal sentence.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.684
You're showing your hand, Ben,

33:40.686 --> 33:44.054
and a four flush doesn't beat
a pair of treys.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.123
A woman agrees to testify
against your client

33:46.125 --> 33:48.358
in a federal fraud case
and ends up dead.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.793
You got a death certificate?

33:49.795 --> 33:51.762
I don't need one,
I have motive,

33:51.764 --> 33:54.097
and Teasdale's bribe
is corroboration in my book.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.800
You're on the wrong page, Ben.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.169
Hell, you're
in the wrong volume.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.071
Teasdale called Kemp.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.607
Maybe Teasdale
is the one with motive.

34:03.609 --> 34:07.077
Maybe Janet Torrens
was about to sing<i> his</i> song.

34:07.079 --> 34:10.147
Martine had nothing
to do with any murders.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.215
That's a crock and you know it.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.084
It's also reasonable doubt.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.219
I'll take my chance with a jury.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.822
If you've got the stamina
to get that far.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.092
Now, a clean slate
for Martine.

34:22.094 --> 34:24.094
And maybe then he'll talk.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.096
Don't be ridiculous.

34:26.098 --> 34:29.633
You're still swimming
upstream, Ben.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.401
Open those baby blues.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.769
You can't beat me.

34:32.771 --> 34:36.139
A jury sees a knife,
hears that tape...

34:36.141 --> 34:39.843
You don't think I'm going
to let that happen, do you?

34:39.845 --> 34:42.579
I'll see you in court, Ben.

34:50.089 --> 34:51.354
Hot off the presses.

34:51.356 --> 34:53.490
Gold's suppression motion.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.258
The tape?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.476
And the knife.

34:56.477 --> 34:57.693
Claims they were both
obtained illegally.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.329
And?

34:59.331 --> 35:01.548
The knife's no problem.

35:01.549 --> 35:03.766
The Supreme Court said
that consensual searches

35:03.769 --> 35:07.104
do not invoke
fourth amendment protection.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.371
You talked to Cerreta?

35:08.373 --> 35:10.107
He'll testify tomorrow.

35:10.109 --> 35:13.110
Kemp agreed to let them search
his duffel bag.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.478
The tape's another story.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.480
Cerreta confirms Styger's claim.

35:16.482 --> 35:20.684
Teasdale told them to talk
to him through his lawyer.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.253
The police cannot do
through an agent

35:23.255 --> 35:25.388
what they
couldn't do themselves.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.324
Judge Janklow
is a practical man.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.825
He likes to do the right thing.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.795
Maybe he'll overlook
the letter of the law.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.398
<i> If I weren't bound by oath</i>
<i> to give every litigant</i>

35:35.400 --> 35:37.267
their day in court

35:37.269 --> 35:39.503
I'd enter sanctions
against each of you.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.339
Mr. Gold, I suggest
you read the opinions

35:42.341 --> 35:46.209
of the Supreme Court
on consensual searches

35:46.211 --> 35:48.478
beginning with the latest
sermon from the mount

35:48.480 --> 35:50.347
<i>Florida v. Bostwick.</i>

35:50.349 --> 35:53.383
If the police can
randomly search bus passengers

35:53.385 --> 35:56.553
no stretch of logic
can mandate the inadmissibility

35:56.555 --> 35:59.389
of a consensual search
of a train.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.292
Your Honor,
the case law in this circuit...

36:02.294 --> 36:05.162
Highlights the frivolity
of your motion

36:05.164 --> 36:06.796
and, Mr. Stone,

36:06.798 --> 36:11.168
unless the<i> Hamad</i> case and
it's progeny have been overruled

36:11.170 --> 36:13.170
while I was napping

36:13.172 --> 36:16.473
the tape is as dirty
as last week's laundry.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.842
All right

36:18.844 --> 36:21.211
the knife is in.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.213
The tape is out.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.515
Can we set this down
for trial?

36:25.517 --> 36:28.285
My law professor said
for enough money

36:28.287 --> 36:31.454
he could keep any defendant
out of jail for three years.

36:31.456 --> 36:33.323
Martine's got the bucks.

36:33.325 --> 36:36.359
In a perfect world,
we wouldn't have discovery.

36:36.361 --> 36:40.363
Just go to trial and let
the chips fall where they may.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.266
In a perfect world,
people wouldn't get shot.

36:43.268 --> 36:44.801
Round two from Gold.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.370
This one's for change
of venue.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.340
Excessive publicity
in this county.

36:50.342 --> 36:53.343
I assume the return date
is Monday.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.945
Yeah.

36:56.481 --> 36:58.348
You've really outdone yourself.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.483
Adverse publicity. Really?

37:00.485 --> 37:03.887
The New York papers have
already convicted my client.

37:03.889 --> 37:07.824
I'd be doing myself a favor
by transferring this.

37:07.826 --> 37:08.925
Your Honor...

37:08.927 --> 37:10.894
I know you're opposed, Ben.

37:10.896 --> 37:14.364
Look, Arthur, if you insist
on going through with this

37:14.366 --> 37:18.268
and I waste a whole weekend
reading your papers

37:18.270 --> 37:19.603
I promise you

37:19.605 --> 37:22.405
I'll make the rest of your trip
very difficult.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.441
In light of your
predisposition...

37:24.443 --> 37:27.310
Can the histrionics, Arthur.
We're off the record.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.312
I will agree
to withdraw the motion.

37:29.314 --> 37:32.449
However, some new information
has come to my attention

37:32.451 --> 37:35.452
which could bear
on the outcome of this trial.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.520
Now, since
we're all here

37:37.522 --> 37:40.357
I move
that Mr. Stone be disqualified.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.491
What?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.593
For the last two years

37:43.595 --> 37:45.395
Mr. Stone and Larry Teasdale

37:45.397 --> 37:48.498
have co-chaired
a bar association committee.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.034
There is no relevance...

37:51.036 --> 37:54.404
Any favoritism that Mr. Stone
might show Mr. Teasdale

37:54.406 --> 37:57.641
because of said personal
relationship could prejudice

37:57.643 --> 37:58.875
my client.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.443
Three hours, once a year.

38:00.445 --> 38:04.547
I never so much as had
a cup of coffee with the man.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.416
How can I be sure of that?

38:06.418 --> 38:07.417
The defendants

38:07.419 --> 38:08.985
are being tried together.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.021
They should certainly be

38:11.023 --> 38:12.956
on a level playing ground.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.525
I'm sure
the district attorney's office

38:15.527 --> 38:18.928
can spare another assistant
to prosecute this case.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.898
He's got a valid point, Ben.

38:23.302 --> 38:24.968
I move to sever.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.003
Paul Robinette

38:27.005 --> 38:28.438
will try Mr. Teasdale.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.474
I'll continue
with Kemp and Martine.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.009
You sure, Ben?

38:33.011 --> 38:35.612
Yes, Your Honor, I am.

38:37.049 --> 38:39.049
Anybody here opposed?

38:40.452 --> 38:42.953
No, Judge.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.455
As a matter of fact,
I would consider it an honor

38:45.457 --> 38:48.325
to have the opportunity
to clash swords

38:48.327 --> 38:50.360
with Mr. Stone.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.529
The severance hurts the case.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.930
Remove Teasdale

38:53.932 --> 38:56.599
and the jury sees
no connection whatsoever

38:56.601 --> 38:58.601
between Martine and Kemp.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.737
They could all walk, Ben.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.972
Teasdale is
the weak link.

39:02.974 --> 39:06.009
Now that he's on his own,
he'll roll.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.344
Why should he?

39:07.346 --> 39:08.478
Without the tape

39:08.480 --> 39:11.748
he's got no incentive.

39:11.750 --> 39:15.618
If gold had made the motion,
what would you have done?

39:15.620 --> 39:17.620
You would have hit
the ceiling.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.456
He wanted the severance.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.458
He knew you'd oppose

39:21.460 --> 39:24.594
so he conned you into making
the motion for him

39:24.596 --> 39:27.030
by asking to have you removed.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.066
Gold knew you wanted
another shot at him in court.

39:30.068 --> 39:34.571
He led you to water,
and you dove in head first.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.707
No excuses--
you screwed up.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.376
I thought...

39:39.378 --> 39:41.411
Brains were not
involved here.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.980
You tried to outflex him
and it backfired.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.683
A personal agenda
should be kept on the street

39:46.685 --> 39:50.520
not dragged into a courtroom
where real people get hurt.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.655
You insisted
I deal with the man.

39:52.657 --> 39:55.625
You want me
to back away from severance?

39:55.627 --> 39:57.160
Where do we stand?

39:57.162 --> 39:58.528
We don't.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.597
What do you suggest?

40:00.599 --> 40:04.534
Find a way to make the tape
magically admissible?

40:04.536 --> 40:07.537
The tape is inadmissible
against Teasdale.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.572
Paul is trying him
separately.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.008
You think the judge
would let it in

40:12.010 --> 40:13.977
against Martine and Kemp?

40:13.979 --> 40:18.481
I think you ought to get them
thinking about it.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.586
I don't really like this.
McMANUS:

40:23.588 --> 40:26.456
This should help ease the pain.
TEASDALE:

40:26.458 --> 40:29.492
the day together.
You and Kemp spent

40:29.494 --> 40:31.027
You cooked a meal.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.595
You had a drink.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.597
You hopped in the sack.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.599
You took care of business

40:36.601 --> 40:40.170
to the train station.
and then you went with him

40:40.172 --> 40:42.739
I'm not very good at this.
McMANUS:

40:42.741 --> 40:45.809
For 25 thou, you better be.
TEASDALE:

40:48.580 --> 40:50.113
So what?

40:50.115 --> 40:53.550
It wasn't admissible then,
it's not admissible now.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.519
The tape was inadmissible
against Mr. Teasdale.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.188
The cases have been severed.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.523
Teasdale's being tried
separately.

41:00.525 --> 41:03.726
So as to Mr. Kemp here,
it's a whole new ball game.

41:03.728 --> 41:06.529
I have already submitted
motion papers

41:06.531 --> 41:08.164
for a rehearing.

41:08.166 --> 41:12.035
Now if you still want
to roll the dice, Mr. Kemp

41:12.037 --> 41:13.736
be my guest

41:13.738 --> 41:17.740
but the rest of your life
is a very long time.

41:17.742 --> 41:20.477
WERNER:
What are you putting

41:20.479 --> 41:22.245
in your coffee, Stone?

41:22.247 --> 41:24.614
You're high if you think...

41:24.616 --> 41:28.184
I think this offer is open
for another ten seconds.

41:28.186 --> 41:32.489
Next stop, Mr. Martine.

41:32.491 --> 41:36.559
I doubt if he's willing to take
the chance to let that tape

41:36.561 --> 41:38.127
into evidence.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.562
Man-two, one count.

41:39.564 --> 41:40.897
He serves five.

41:40.899 --> 41:44.234
Murder two, 25.

41:45.770 --> 41:51.541
Man-one, five to 15,
and you got a deal.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.843
And you serve the max.

42:01.186 --> 42:04.521
I told him the parking lot
would be a bust.

42:04.523 --> 42:05.755
Martine?

42:05.757 --> 42:07.891
I never talked to him.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.293
My contact was Teasdale.

42:10.295 --> 42:13.796
I should know better
than to listen to a lawyer.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.298
He wanted me

42:15.300 --> 42:18.568
to do her with a knife
like a mugging.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.770
ROBINETTE:
But Hovis and Coyle

42:20.772 --> 42:22.272
crashed the party?

42:22.274 --> 42:25.241
Everybody knows
this city's nuts-to-butts.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.210
If it hadn't been the suits

42:27.212 --> 42:29.546
it would have been
somebody else.

42:29.548 --> 42:31.648
You should have seen
their faces.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.683
And Janet Torrens?

42:33.685 --> 42:35.919
What? I'm going
to leave her there

42:35.921 --> 42:37.620
with the dead guys?

42:37.622 --> 42:41.558
I want to know exactly
where she is.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.196
CERRETA:
The rats got to her.

42:47.198 --> 42:50.700
Another week, there would be
nothing left but bones.

42:50.702 --> 42:53.636
So much
for "sleeps with the fishes."

42:53.638 --> 42:55.338
The East River--

42:55.340 --> 42:57.840
we'd be lucky
to have the bones.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.781
Six inches,
right across the neck.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.649
I'll call
her parents.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.851
I hope they all
rot in hell.

43:08.853 --> 43:11.287
One more stop
and they will.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.331
It's man-two or nothing.

43:21.333 --> 43:24.734
Mr. Teasdale is directly
responsible for three deaths.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.603
Which you have
no way of proving.

43:26.605 --> 43:28.605
You had nothing
when he was in charge.

43:28.607 --> 43:29.872
Things don't change
that quickly.

43:29.874 --> 43:31.874
Yes, they do, Miss Styger.

43:31.876 --> 43:34.777
Frank Kemp agreed to testify
against your client.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.313
Man-one, one count,
you serve 15.

43:37.315 --> 43:39.649
It's the same
as we gave Kemp.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.620
We're better off
going the distance.

43:43.622 --> 43:48.291
The distance is three terms,
25 to life on each.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.360
Think about it.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.330
Ben...

43:56.201 --> 43:59.636
there's nothing you can do?

44:08.213 --> 44:10.013
We'll take the 15.

44:11.950 --> 44:14.651
GOLD:
<i> that my client has withdrawn</i>

44:14.653 --> 44:17.987
his plea of not guilty
and entered a plea of guilty

44:17.989 --> 44:21.357
and thereby saved this court
the time and expense

44:21.359 --> 44:24.394
of what surely would have been
a lengthy trial

44:24.396 --> 44:27.797
I respectfully request
that Your Honor show leniency

44:27.799 --> 44:29.666
and sentence Mr. Martine

44:29.668 --> 44:32.669
to the mandatory minimum
sentence of 15 to life.

44:32.671 --> 44:34.370
May I remind the court

44:34.372 --> 44:36.839
that Mr. Martine has
a wife and children.

44:36.841 --> 44:41.277
He should have thought of them
before he ordered a murder.

44:41.279 --> 44:44.781
Do you have anything to say
before I pronounce sentence?

44:44.783 --> 44:46.282
No, Your Honor.

44:46.284 --> 44:47.817
Charles Martine,

44:47.819 --> 44:51.054
having pled guilty
to the murder of Janet Torrens

44:51.056 --> 44:53.456
Greg Hovis and Peter Coyle

44:53.458 --> 44:55.958
I sentence you
to three terms each

44:55.960 --> 44:59.262
of 25 years to life
to be served consecutively

44:59.264 --> 45:02.331
in the state correctional
facility in Ossinging

45:02.333 --> 45:06.969
and just be thankful
that is the most severe sentence

45:06.971 --> 45:08.271
the law allows.

45:08.273 --> 45:09.906
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )

45:09.908 --> 45:11.441
GOLD:
Silver platters.

45:11.443 --> 45:13.443
I handed it to you, Ben.

45:13.445 --> 45:15.278
You would never
have thought

45:15.280 --> 45:16.979
to sever those cases

45:16.981 --> 45:19.382
had I not moved
to have you disqualified.

45:19.384 --> 45:21.884
I was going
to use that tape, Arthur.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.853
Severance was
the only way.

45:23.855 --> 45:26.055
You're not that smart.

45:26.057 --> 45:27.790
You never were.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.726
Call me for lunch.

45:29.728 --> 45:32.361
You'd actually eat lunch
with him?

45:32.363 --> 45:34.564
Only if he orders crow.
