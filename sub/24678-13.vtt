Narrator:
In New York City war on crime

00:03.670 --> 00:07.379
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:07.407 --> 00:08.977
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.489
These are their stories.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.160
Girl: So Brittany's like, committed.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.389
Who knows if she's even going to show up.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.489
That's not even the point. Who is this guy?

00:20.521 --> 00:24.663
All of a sudden he's supposed
to be in Atlanta for an Elton John benefit.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.501
He is off of the VIP list forever.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.809
Lilly, I need to speak with you.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.778
We're late, Daddy.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.241
This article?

00:36.270 --> 00:38.511
Lilly: Dad, that's great exposure.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.519
That's a national magazine.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.578
Didn't you get enough exposure last summer

00:42.609 --> 00:44.680
when you nearly ran over those people?

00:44.711 --> 00:48.523
- Yeah, by accident.
- And now this-- this exposé of your sex life?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.855
Nobody takes that stuff seriously.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.264
They do, Lilly. It's degrading.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.830
Well, I didn't do it to embarrass you, okay?

01:00.994 --> 01:03.975
- Let's talk about this later.
- Where are you going?

01:03.997 --> 01:06.443
- Where do you think?
- I don't want you going there.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.140
I know what goes on there.
That so-called friend of yours,

01:09.169 --> 01:10.876
if he doesn't stay away from you--

01:10.904 --> 01:13.817
- Daddy, stop it!
- Lilly, I mean it.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.842
I can hurt him.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.054
Lilly, I’m on your side.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.962
Sometimes I wish you'd remember that.

01:32.693 --> 01:36.231
Does it ever occur to your dad
what a supreme geek he is?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.675
Don't say that. Well, he is.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.872
Well, shut up, Serena.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.014
( techno music playing )

01:47.874 --> 01:49.876
Man: You need to get out of there.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.891
- 'Cause that is out of control.
- He was threatening me.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.722
I was like, "Oh, that's great, Daddy.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.489
Real warm and fuzzy. I love you, too."

01:56.516 --> 01:58.689
You want me to do a Menendez on him?

01:58.719 --> 02:00.528
Just say the word, I’m there for you.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.329
Thank you, sweetie.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.666
Hey, jerkwad!

02:07.694 --> 02:09.833
Put it away, Eddie.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.736
I'm sorry, man, I got this.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.806
Go tell Jimmy I said
take care of you, all right?

02:17.838 --> 02:20.717
Try that again, I'm not
letting you back in here.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.785
- How you ladies doing?
- Great.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.819
'Cause we've only been here a half hour.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.695
Where have you been?

02:34.855 --> 02:37.028
Come on, I want to talk to you.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.735
Where'd you go to?

02:50.203 --> 02:52.479
Let's have some fun.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.763
Johnny, what is this?

03:15.762 --> 03:17.799
Honey, go back inside now.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.674
Now.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.108
That was weird.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.018
Could you just leave me alone, please?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.863
Daddy, it's me.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.503
Are you there?

03:53.533 --> 03:55.672
Pick up.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.376
Pick up, pick up, please!

04:07.481 --> 04:09.984
( muffled yelling )

04:15.655 --> 04:18.135
Mister Carlyle? Hello?

04:18.158 --> 04:20.570
Lilly: Please get up!

04:21.827 --> 04:24.968
Please, I didn't mean to yell at you!

04:24.998 --> 04:27.911
Please get up!

04:27.934 --> 04:30.471
That's great, Dad! Just lie there!

04:31.805 --> 04:33.978
Please!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.255
Daddy!

04:37.277 --> 04:39.951
Please get up! Get up!

04:44.851 --> 04:47.354
Daddy, please, don't do this.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.199
( theme music playing )

05:42.342 --> 05:46.017
Wharton Carlyle, son of the late
Titus Carlyle, the billboard king.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.657
What do you make of this?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.992
The guy's stabbed here
with a double-edged knife

05:51.017 --> 05:54.328
and then hits his head
on the floor when he falls.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.164
Look at the indentation, the rip in the skin.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.000
You don't get that from hitting the floor.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.199
I'd look at all the oars around here.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.971
I bet you find part of
Carlyle's brain on one of them.

06:04.998 --> 06:08.445
Rowed in the Olympics in '72, in Munich.

06:08.468 --> 06:11.449
- His daughter into it?
- First time I've seen her.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.816
I get here, there he is,
she's all going haywire.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.946
You get much trouble with the neighborhood?

06:16.977 --> 06:19.116
Nah, just the occasional bum.

06:19.145 --> 06:22.149
I feel bad about this. He was a nice guy.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.631
Lilly Carlyle.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.463
Somebody call Dominick Dunne.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.969
- What, you know about her?
- "It Girl" of the minute.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.699
Famous for being rich and famous.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.673
"Details " magazine, "Vanity Fair"

06:35.695 --> 06:38.539
Very popular, very young, very everything.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.806
Excuse me, are you the new detectives?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.780
Because I kind of need to get out of here.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.076
She sounds like lots of fun.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.320
Are you warm enough, Ms. Carlyle?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.151
'Cause we could get you some coffee.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.851
No. Look, I'm sorry. I'm just--

06:53.880 --> 06:57.157
I'm a little bit of a wreck
right now and I need to go home.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.164
Unfortunately, as traumatic
as this has been for you,

07:00.186 --> 07:01.665
we can't allow you to leave

07:01.688 --> 07:04.760
until we get a better sense
of what happened here this morning.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.237
I showed up and I found my father dead!

07:08.962 --> 07:10.703
Are you on drugs, Ms. Carlyle?

07:10.730 --> 07:13.301
Excuse me, what did you say?

07:13.333 --> 07:16.780
I was wondering if you'd
consent to a drug test.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.680
Man: Don't answer that.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.707
Hall, thank God!

07:20.740 --> 07:22.276
This is terrible.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.847
It's okay, Lilly. Hall Richmond,
I'm a friend of the family.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.415
And a lawyer.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.518
Lilly will be happy to answer your questions

07:29.549 --> 07:32.496
once she's had a chance to go home
and change and compose herself

07:32.519 --> 07:34.897
As for a drug test, the answer's no.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.992
Come on, Lilly.

07:39.526 --> 07:43.440
I got a call from the inspector, who got
a call from the chief of detectives,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.636
who got a call from a lawyer named Richmond.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.144
Here come the smoke and mirrors.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.646
You asked to drug test this girl?

07:48.668 --> 07:50.978
- Tell me she's not a suspect.
- She's a suspect.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.144
I've seen this girl in my kid's magazines,
she's 90 pounds soaking wet.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.711
With a nose full of cocaine,
she's a 400-pound gorilla.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.882
Still, the guy was an Olympic champion.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.482
She could've had an accomplice.

08:00.513 --> 08:02.754
- How's that work?
- Two weapons.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.422
We found the oar used on his skull,
wiped clean of prints.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.762
Torso wounds from a dagger, presumably...

08:07.787 --> 08:10.393
Gathering silt at the bottom
of the Harlem river.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.927
Okay.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.133
I'll call Hall Richmond, make sure
he brings Ms. Carlyle by for a chat.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.436
Aren't you going to ask me if I did it?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.778
Hall: It's irrelevant, Lilly.

08:23.803 --> 08:27.580
Now, whatever you do,
you must not lie to the police.

08:27.607 --> 08:31.145
If there's anything I don't want
you to answer, I'll let you know.

08:38.618 --> 08:42.155
You're out of your depth, so keep
your mouth shut and do what I tell you.

08:49.996 --> 08:53.239
My dad was angry about a magazine article...

08:54.300 --> 08:57.838
And we got into a fight Thursday night,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.479
and I went there to apologize.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.954
And then when I saw that he was dead,

09:05.979 --> 09:08.357
you know-- and I just
started throwing things,

09:08.381 --> 09:10.122
but that's all that happened.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.131
Eames: You drove from the West
Village all the way up to the Bronx.

09:13.153 --> 09:17.192
- Who was with you?
- Nobody.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.597
Anybody you know carry a knife?

09:20.627 --> 09:22.436
I wouldn't associate with people

09:22.462 --> 09:24.806
who carry weapons, now would I?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.281
I didn't know very much about you,

09:30.303 --> 09:33.841
so I pulled some articles off the computer,

09:33.873 --> 09:36.615
and I went to the newsstand.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.783
Is this one of the articles
that made your father upset?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.793
- No.
- How about this one?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.159
It was this one, wasn't it?

09:46.152 --> 09:49.622
You're very candid about
your sex life in this article.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.306
Was your father embarrassed?

09:58.998 --> 10:01.308
It's promotion,

10:01.334 --> 10:04.372
for my public relations business.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.180
Last summer...

10:10.677 --> 10:12.213
You got into an--

10:12.245 --> 10:15.317
an altercation with a photographer?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.828
No, he was intruding on my privacy.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.991
You see, people like me are always targets!

10:21.020 --> 10:24.433
You nearly ran him over with your car.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.336
Did your father think
that's appropriate for...

10:27.360 --> 10:29.362
People like you?

10:29.395 --> 10:33.935
No. People like me don't have
to put up with crap like this!

10:33.967 --> 10:36.971
- Lilly—
- No! I'm not doing this anymore!

10:37.003 --> 10:39.449
We'll need the names of the people
you were with last night.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.919
Just go to the club. They all know me there.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.889
Hall: If you’ll excuse us.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.259
John: I don't remember seeing
her leave. We were packed.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.928
- At 5:00 a.m. on Friday morning?
- 5:00 a.m. any morning.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.836
- How about who she was with?
- Like I said, it was a zoo.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.773
You got security. How about you
pull the tapes from that night?

11:03.796 --> 11:05.639
It's a loop. It's not going to help you.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.645
You know, I read that she did PR for you.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.010
What does she do exactly?

11:09.035 --> 11:11.641
She's Lilly Carlyle.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.151
Her Rolodex looks like the
guest list at the MTV Awards.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.313
She put us on the map.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.482
Is that the reason why you're
giving us the runaround?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.991
Come on.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.994
Mr. Hampton,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.326
you can alienate her, or you can alienate us.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.491
But we can get a lot
nastier than some debutante.

11:29.956 --> 11:33.199
Talk to Serena Whitfield. She was with her.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.943
Serena: I don't remember anything unusual.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.022
Lilly talk about her father that night?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.031
Was she upset with him?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.124
I don't know anything about that.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.261
These are the police. Tell them
what they want to know.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.306
Her dad was on her a lot.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.335
And Lilly was like--

12:16.636 --> 12:18.843
she can give as good as she gets.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.374
What was his problem with Lilly?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.445
He didn't like her hanging out at the Aztec.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.979
Eames: Why?

12:26.012 --> 12:28.856
He didn't like the people there,
the people who ran the place.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.663
Her dad told Lilly he knew
what was going on there

12:32.685 --> 12:34.995
and he was going to shut it down.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.433
What was going on at the club?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.029
Like...

12:44.063 --> 12:46.043
Thursday night...

12:48.034 --> 12:50.674
There was this guy getting
beat up behind the club.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.341
I don't know who he was.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.319
- Eames: Who was beating him up?
- Two guys, these big guys.

12:55.341 --> 12:58.788
Everybody says they're gangsters.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.018
Those 2 were just wailing on this other guy.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.323
John was there.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.623
John Hampton?

13:04.651 --> 13:06.255
Yes.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.567
Lilly was so freaked out.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.033
Hampton, John. That's right.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.302
Business address is 1-1-2 Garston.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.976
Okay, get back to me.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.841
Cabaret license is held by Hampton.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.574
Same story with the liquor license.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.741
We're not the only ones
checking up on him.

13:24.771 --> 13:28.014
Two weeks ago, Wharton Carlyle,
through his non-profit foundation,

13:28.041 --> 13:30.521
called the State Liquor Authority
about Hampton.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.820
He also called the Real Estate Board
and the Health Department.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.486
It looks like Hampton
didn't want the attention.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.488
Last few years, Hampton ran a couple
of clubs in Tempe, Arizona.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.162
Cited for serving alcohol
to minors, fire regs.

13:45.191 --> 13:48.502
- He paid his fines.
- Tempe's a long way from Mott Street.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.508
The club is connected, Captain.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.703
The magic gut speaks.

13:55.034 --> 13:58.174
If I'm going to talk up
this mob angle upstairs,

13:58.204 --> 14:00.878
you're going to have to prove it to me first.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.288
Excuse me. Excuse me. This is a private lot.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.689
- Yeah? Who owns it?
- Sorry, Officer.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.092
It's leased, actually, by the Aztec Club.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.959
I hope there's no problem.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.624
We're just keeping an eye on the neighborhood.

14:14.654 --> 14:18.261
- How come?
- Because we're the police.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.966
- How long have you been
exclusive to the club?
- A couple of months.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.598
And they make it worth your while

14:23.629 --> 14:26.303
to keep the place deserted
like this during the day?

14:26.332 --> 14:29.176
It's an arrangement.
It works for them, it works for me.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.547
It looks more like you're working for them.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.978
When you made this arrangement,
they threaten you?

14:38.010 --> 14:41.116
- We’ll protect you.
- Right. Right.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.990
Who are the lucky stiffs

14:43.015 --> 14:44.961
who get to park here during the day?

14:44.984 --> 14:48.056
That's Mr. Hampton's car. He owns the club.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.835
That one-- I don't know.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.676
Looks like it's been here a few days.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.541
The paper on the dash is from Thursday.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.705
This car's been here since Thursday night?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.442
Yeah.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.949
Is there a problem?

15:05.972 --> 15:07.974
You'll be the first to know.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.288
I already told the cops at the hospital.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.793
It was on Little West 12th and 9th.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.296
Four guys, one with a gun.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.298
They jacked my van.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.459
The next thing you know,

15:23.489 --> 15:25.298
I wake up in the emergency room.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.565
It's so amazing you got Pete's van back.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.539
Did you catch the guys?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.134
No.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.673
Mr. Samuels, did you
do any work at the Aztec Club?

15:38.004 --> 15:39.813
I never heard of the place.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.319
We found your van in the parking lot.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.879
- Who roughed you up, Pete?
- We know you’re afraid.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.222
The fact is,

15:48.247 --> 15:50.488
if you don't help us, we can't help you.

15:50.516 --> 15:53.360
Yeah, but I'm not asking for help, all right?

15:53.386 --> 15:55.866
- I didn't ask you here.
- We're here anyway.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.135
I installed the audio system at the Aztec.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.701
Eames: Were you there Thursday night?

16:07.733 --> 16:08.939
Uh-oh.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.312
They asked me in to adjust the subs.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.949
As soon as I got there, they went after me.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.114
On account they heard that I took a gig

16:18.144 --> 16:20.954
with a new place down on 9th.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.325
No one told me I was exclusive.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.636
That's the other guy, Vinny.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.475
Him and Frank did the beat-down.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.540
- And Hampton just watched.
- You did a good thing, Pete, thanks.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.780
I don't have to come back again, right?
They don't have to know it was me.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.253
- No.
- No, that's good.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.882
Now's a good time to think
this is going to piss 'em off!

16:52.912 --> 16:55.984
Come on, Cry-- hey, Crystal,
come here. Wait a minute.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.552
Vincent Russo. Frank Ventura.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.497
Kissing cousins of the Genoveses'..

17:10.463 --> 17:11.942
( knocking )

17:11.964 --> 17:13.965
One second.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.877
( knocking )

17:24.644 --> 17:27.284
Why'd you lock your door?
You got somebody in here?

17:27.313 --> 17:31.455
I was taking a nap. Here you go,
coat check and bar tabs.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.624
We got a new guy we want you
to use for your glassware.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.793
I already got 2,000 glasses, Vinny.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.063
Guess what? They're all chipped.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.640
Okay, okay.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.141
Look...

17:44.163 --> 17:46.643
The police came by about the Carlyle murder.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.543
I don't need that kind of heat.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.549
Hampton, don't go looking for trouble.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.519
Lilly: My Dad never told
me anything about the mob.

18:00.546 --> 18:03.584
Eames: Why was he looking
into the club's ownership?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.755
I don't know.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.789
Why does it have to be about
this whole mob thing?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.768
Why can't it just be some mugger
who tried to rob him?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.600
It's going to be what it's going to be.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.469
Why do you care one way or the other?

18:15.494 --> 18:18.600
I don't care about what
happens to these guys.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.271
I think you care about
what happens to John Hampton.

18:27.139 --> 18:29.278
John isn't a mobster.

18:29.308 --> 18:33.620
Sorry to give you the bad news about
the guy you've been sleeping with …

18:34.981 --> 18:36.892
Excuse me, what?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.362
Were you or weren't you?

18:39.385 --> 18:43.128
Lilly, I think you should answer
the detectives truthfully.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.497
It was a very casual thing.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.978
But enough to worry your father.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.980
He didn't want me going down there.

18:56.002 --> 18:59.176
I told John he shouldn't let those guys in,

18:59.205 --> 19:03.278
that it was a horrible image for the club.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.087
And he said that he had no choice.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.218
Did he say why?

19:09.248 --> 19:11.524
This guy, Vinny...

19:12.618 --> 19:15.098
John said the feds had him indicted

19:15.121 --> 19:17.499
because he chopped off a guy's hand.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.333
A federal indictment? John Hampton said that?

19:20.359 --> 19:22.100
Yeah.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.572
Since when?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.912
Okay, thanks, Harry.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.814
There's an indictment all right.

19:33.839 --> 19:38.288
Federal grand jury billed Russo for
torture and extortion four months ago.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.450
- It's not on his sheet.
- They said it was sealed.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.155
Where does a nightclub owner find out
about a sealed federal indictment?

19:50.322 --> 19:52.461
What's it called, Aztec?

19:52.491 --> 19:55.301
- Yes.
- I never heard of it.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.638
I can run the name of the principals
through the Bureau's database,

19:58.664 --> 20:00.302
see what comes up?

20:00.332 --> 20:01.970
Could you? That'd be so helpful.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.278
Mmm. What's your interest in this club?

20:05.304 --> 20:07.045
It's in connection with a murder.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.882
Wharton Carlyle, kind of a big shot.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.751
Well, who you looking at for it?

20:10.776 --> 20:14.747
Vincent Russo, Frank Ventura,
plus a newcomer, John Hampton.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.659
We're about to execute search
and arrest warrants.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.560
You can't do that.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.622
Really? Why's that?

20:25.024 --> 20:28.267
The Aztec is a Bureau sting operation.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.566
And John Hampton would be Agent John Hampton?

20:44.043 --> 20:46.683
We have spent over a year
putting this in place.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.693
We're well into building
a case against the Genoveses

20:49.715 --> 20:52.855
for extortion, racketeering, money laundering.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.195
We're not jeopardizing that for some--

20:55.221 --> 20:57.167
For a murder investigation.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.129
How long before you roll up
the operation?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.299
- Four to six months.
- Six months!

21:03.329 --> 21:05.969
What do we do till then,
watch our leads turn to ice?

21:05.998 --> 21:07.807
I sympathize with your problem.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.540
Maybe I can be your eyes and your ears.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.138
You'll do no such thing.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.150
The Aztec Club is off limits.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.243
I won't have my agent compromised.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.447
Then you better pull him out.

21:17.476 --> 21:21.481
Because as long as it's in the five
boroughs, that club's on our beat.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.790
I want to see the tapes.
It's a sting operation.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.659
I want to see the surveillance tapes.

21:25.684 --> 21:29.325
- Absolutely not.
- Deakins: I get calls every day

21:29.355 --> 21:31.130
from the mayor on down on this case.

21:31.157 --> 21:35.469
Sure would be great to tell them
how helpful the Bureau's been.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.074
I think I got something interesting
from Thursday night.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.105
So John, you like undercover?

21:47.506 --> 21:50.282
Beats driving a desk in the
Phoenix field office.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.755
After a while, you forget
you're playing dress-up.

21:52.778 --> 21:55.554
It's like a groove. You ever try it?

21:55.581 --> 21:58.061
I wouldn't be any good.
It's just not in my nature.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.462
Those 4 years in Narcotics, what was that?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.728
You ran 3 undercover operations,

22:06.759 --> 22:08.796
27 arrests, 27 convictions.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.476
- You read my file.
- Wouldn't you?

22:12.498 --> 22:16.002
And Eames, you transferred to Major Case
after three years in Vice.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.946
Winter nights trolling the Point

22:17.970 --> 22:21.474
in a fur coat and a halter top
looking for johns.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.316
It's tough duty.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.413
Let's not run games on each other.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.521
Okay, let's check it out.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.663
That's Eddie Dutton.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.033
He shows up every time Lilly's around.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.338
This might help you.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.375
Is there any more to the tape?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.710
That's all I can show you.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.482
Good hunting.

23:05.517 --> 23:07.292
It was in your bedroom, Eddie.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.128
A double-edged knife.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.657
The same kind of weapon used
to kill Lilly's dad.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.570
Listen. I'm not even--

23:16.562 --> 23:18.872
- This is nuts, okay?
- Relax, Eddie.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.844
We're going to get to the bottom of this.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.870
Oh, Jeez. You know, this is--

23:23.903 --> 23:26.747
that's just really what I--

23:26.772 --> 23:30.481
You're going to want to start finishing
a sentence here pretty soon, Eddie.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.819
Forensics is going over your knife.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.917
You got something to tell us,
now would be a good time.

23:37.182 --> 23:39.059
What she says is true.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.423
Okay. Okay.

23:43.455 --> 23:46.868
I offered to get rid of her dad.
I know how it sounds.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.930
When I drink, I say pretty much anything.

23:49.962 --> 23:53.273
Well, people say things they
don't mean when they're drunk.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.006
But then it happened. He's dead.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.036
I'm screwed, man, this is wha--

23:59.538 --> 24:01.711
Well, you're in trouble, that's a fact.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.448
You keep telling us the truth,
we'll see where it gets us.

24:04.476 --> 24:06.547
Hey, if I was really going to do it,

24:06.578 --> 24:09.218
I wouldn't have flashed
the knife in front of everybody.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.922
- Who's everybody?
- ( sighs )

24:11.951 --> 24:15.797
Lilly, Serena, a photographer,

24:15.821 --> 24:18.028
Hampton.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.966
Man, he really flipped out.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.564
Over the knife?

24:23.595 --> 24:26.075
Yeah, I thought he was going to kill me.

24:27.599 --> 24:30.045
Eames: After all this stuff, what happened?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.208
All I remember is waking up
in the bathroom.

24:32.237 --> 24:35.650
- What time did you leave?
- I don't know. Morning.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.848
The cleaning crew woke me up.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.720
( knocking )

24:49.188 --> 24:50.997
Got a mixed bag from Forensics.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.162
Size and shape consistent with the wound,

24:53.192 --> 24:55.172
but no blood or tissue on the knife.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.071
He could've soaked it in disinfectant.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.337
If he was smart he would
have ditched the knife.

24:59.365 --> 25:03.279
Be happy he's plenty dumb to hand you enough
incriminating statements to choke a judge.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.441
Now you just have to bust his alibi.

25:05.471 --> 25:08.315
I have to brief the chief
of detectives by 6:00.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.114
A little good news wouldn't hurt.

25:13.979 --> 25:15.788
Go and check the alibi.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.851
I'm going to be down in Forensics.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.801
I analyzed the saliva.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.971
This one, traces of animal fat,
mustard residue--

25:36.001 --> 25:38.311
Not that one. I had pastrami for lunch.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.647
That explains the antacid.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.982
The other mug is more interesting--

25:43.008 --> 25:44.214
cocaine.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.019
It's also present in the
fingerprints on the mug.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.787
( techno music playing )

25:52.651 --> 25:54.392
( snorting )

26:00.359 --> 26:02.270
John: Those cops came to see me.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.274
So? They come and see me all the time.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.139
They asked me about you and Eddie.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.839
They think you killed
your father, the two of you.

26:08.867 --> 26:10.608
What?

26:10.636 --> 26:13.276
Who told them that? Did Eddie tell them that?

26:13.305 --> 26:15.683
They had to get it from someplace.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.449
That is so outrageous.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.459
Doesn't really matter.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.654
It's enough the police believe it.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.495
You got to protect yourself.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.004
( snorting )

26:38.664 --> 26:40.644
So what am I going to do?

26:40.666 --> 26:42.509
What I tell you.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.838
( snorting )

26:49.007 --> 26:51.351
There's a way to handle the police.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.491
You know so much about cops, right?

26:54.513 --> 26:56.356
I know enough.

26:57.516 --> 26:58.927
John.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.295
I don't ever want this to end, baby.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.627
You are so too much.

27:08.026 --> 27:11.599
Eddie was drinking vodka gimlets all night.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.871
I think he had, like, seven.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.114
And then he came out
and he said he was going to do

27:18.137 --> 27:20.117
something really cool for me,

27:20.139 --> 27:22.949
that he was going to pull
a Menendez on my dad.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.979
And I just ignored it 'cause I thought

27:26.011 --> 27:28.787
what anybody would think,
that he was just kidding.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.624
Eames: What made you change
your mind about that?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.631
I don't know. I was just thinking.

27:35.587 --> 27:38.090
Then there's the part
where he pulled out the dagger.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.901
- He took out a dagger?
- Yeah.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.636
He got really pissed at this photographer

27:45.664 --> 27:48.975
and he started hashing it around
to impress me.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.982
I mean, I realize now he was
doing all that to impress me,

27:52.004 --> 27:54.314
so that's why I think he did it.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.250
That's why I think he killed my dad.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.848
What was it he said again?

28:04.449 --> 28:07.589
That he was going to do
something really cool for me;

28:07.619 --> 28:11.431
that he was going to pull
a Menendez on my Dad.

28:11.456 --> 28:15.598
By that time he had,
what, three or four drinks?

28:15.627 --> 28:17.004
Seven.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.703
Seven vodka gimlets.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.942
All right, Lilly.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.781
I think that's sufficient.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.344
We appreciate your coming in, Ms. Carlyle.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.356
It took a lot of guts.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.460
The officer will accompany you out.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.155
Hall: Thank you.

28:40.686 --> 28:43.826
I'll call the DA and tell him
we're ready to send up charges.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.463
Goren: Dagger?

28:47.492 --> 28:51.167
Since when does a 20-year-old debutante
use the word dagger?

28:51.196 --> 28:53.506
Maybe she read it in a fashion magazine.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.477
Only cops use the word dagger
to describe a double-edged knife.

28:58.503 --> 29:01.712
It didn't sound on the up-and-up
coming from her, Captain.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.913
Eddie Dutton didn't
just have a lot of drinks,

29:03.942 --> 29:06.252
he had…  seven drinks.

29:06.278 --> 29:10.658
She was coached by her coke-snorting
boyfriend, Agent Hampton.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.923
Undercovers’ have a lot to do to fit in.

29:12.951 --> 29:16.922
Dipping into the nose candy,
humping the local talent is not unheard of.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.935
What is your problem with this guy?

29:18.957 --> 29:20.959
(sighs)

29:22.060 --> 29:26.065
I just get the feeling I got
to watch my back around him.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.941
Well, until you come up with a motive,

29:27.966 --> 29:29.968
don't talk to me about Hampton.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.118
Mr. Carlyle never mentioned
a John Hampton to me.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.522
Mr. Carlyle was a very private man.

29:41.546 --> 29:45.221
If it didn't have anything to do with the
foundation's work, we didn't discuss it.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.787
Ever see the name on any
documents or correspondence?

29:47.819 --> 29:49.799
- No.
- Eames.

29:49.821 --> 29:52.301
It's the office phone records.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.099
In the two weeks before the murder,

29:54.126 --> 29:56.732
there are three phone calls to Phoenix.

29:59.998 --> 30:02.308
Hello? What was that?

30:02.334 --> 30:04.905
Wagner Security.

30:04.936 --> 30:08.008
Is there a Mr. Wagner I can speak to?

30:10.008 --> 30:11.988
Mr. Wagner?

30:12.010 --> 30:15.150
Detective Goren. This is Detective Eames.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.887
You're a tough guy to get hold of.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.485
Well, can't hit a moving target.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.657
You mind if we hurry?
My plane was late and I have a meeting.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.224
So you wanted to know what
I did for Wharton Carlyle?

30:24.256 --> 30:28.329
- Whatever you can tell us.
- He had me run a background check on
a guy in Arizona.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.341
- Name of John Hampton.
- Did he say why?

30:31.363 --> 30:34.173
Carlyle had found some explicit Polaroids

30:34.199 --> 30:36.179
of Hampton with his daughter.

30:36.201 --> 30:39.011
Plus evidence Hampton had given her drugs.

30:39.037 --> 30:41.847
The girl had floated Hampton some money--

30:41.873 --> 30:44.353
$40 grand.

30:44.376 --> 30:48.085
Carlyle wanted leverage
to get this jerk to cut the girl loose.

30:48.113 --> 30:51.424
Guy works for the Bureau, you believe that?

30:51.450 --> 30:53.623
I'll fax you his file if that'll help.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.529
Great.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.034
How did Carlyle react when you told him?

30:58.056 --> 31:01.094
That an FBI man was corrupting his daughter?

31:01.126 --> 31:03.732
He was not happy about it.
I told him to be careful.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.969
Hampton had already stuck
a gun down the throat

31:05.997 --> 31:08.341
of one of Lilly Carlyle's boyfriends.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.081
Hampton was out of control.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.949
Carlyle was probably leaning on him,

31:15.974 --> 31:17.647
threatening to go to his boss.

31:17.676 --> 31:21.488
Giving drugs to a girl that's not old
enough to drink, taking money from her--

31:21.513 --> 31:23.550
it's indefensible, even for an undercover.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.390
So do we have a motive now?

31:26.418 --> 31:28.364
I think you do.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.493
We're talking about arresting
an undercover FBI agent

31:31.523 --> 31:32.934
in the middle of a sting.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.496
I don't know about you, but I don't want
to be reassigned to the motor pool.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.168
Then it'll be my decision.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.006
I'll get the warrant, you pick him up.

31:44.703 --> 31:47.047
( siren wails )

31:50.208 --> 31:52.245
What the hell is this?

31:52.277 --> 31:56.453
The FBI sting netted a number of
associates of the Genovese crime family,

31:56.481 --> 31:59.018
including popular night
club owner, John Hampton.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.012
Son of a bitch!

32:23.341 --> 32:25.821
United States versus Vincent Russo,

32:25.844 --> 32:28.825
Francis Ventura, John Hampton, et al.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.690
The predicates include

32:30.715 --> 32:33.093
assault in aid of racketeering,

32:33.118 --> 32:35.496
money laundering and extortion.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.557
Judge: How are we pleading, gentlemen?

32:37.589 --> 32:39.500
Not guilty.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.027
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.006
Lawyer: We ask for remand, Your Honor.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.872
The defendants all have previous records

32:45.897 --> 32:48.002
and the evidence against them is substantial.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.070
Defendants are remanded to custody.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.672
Your Honor, ADA Carver,

32:52.704 --> 32:54.877
New York District Attorney's Office.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.715
Before the defendants are removed,

32:56.741 --> 32:59.415
I'd like to be heard on this matter.

32:59.444 --> 33:03.392
The detectives' first attempt to arrest John
Hampton was pre-empted by Agent Wallis.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.157
We’re now simply trying to keep the FBI

33:06.184 --> 33:08.130
from kidnapping our suspect.

33:08.153 --> 33:11.100
Arrest warrant or not,
their murder investigation

33:11.122 --> 33:13.568
can't be allowed to sabotage a federal case.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.766
It's hardly our fault the US Attorney
pinned her hope on a murderer.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.570
His behavior does seem questionable,

33:18.597 --> 33:21.373
but I don't see much direct evidence
linking him to this murder.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.006
If these detectives weren't so busy
running the FBI's obstacle course,

33:25.036 --> 33:27.516
I'm sure they'd find enough
evidence to satisfy you.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.520
Your Honor, in the absence
of compelling evidence,

33:30.542 --> 33:33.113
the federal government
has the greater interest here.

33:33.144 --> 33:36.216
There's an interest greater
than prosecuting the taking of a life?

33:36.248 --> 33:38.194
What law books are you working from?

33:38.216 --> 33:40.127
I have to agree with Ms. Emanuel.

33:40.151 --> 33:43.530
Until I see more evidence,
I'm staying your arrest warrant.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.832
There's also the need to protect
the identity of the Bureau's agent.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.667
I'd like to request a gag order.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.865
Very well.

33:49.895 --> 33:54.537
Mr. Carver, NYPD and your
office is now under gag order.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.706
You can continue to develop your case.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.773
We are done here.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.818
There goes Hampton down the rabbit hole.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.915
Even the FBI can't ignore a federal judge.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.289
You heard him.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.954
The man wants compelling evidence.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.462
Right.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.659
And I want a foot massage from Derek Jeter.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.801
Man: I didn't see him. I'm sorry.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.465
That's all right.

34:24.496 --> 34:28.034
This rope is cut through clean. Are
there any scissors or shears over there?

34:28.065 --> 34:29.306
- Nope.
- Knife?

34:29.333 --> 34:31.905
No knife, but there are hash marks
on this workbench.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.815
Could be from a knife.
Mr. Carlyle keep a knife here?

34:34.839 --> 34:36.819
He had a rigging knife.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.321
A rigging knife.
That's a single-edged blade.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.449
Those double-blades,
they're not so useful.

34:41.478 --> 34:44.119
- Cut yourself, you know?
- Yeah, I know.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.658
Do you think you could pick
the knife from a book?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.496
- Think so.
- We'd appreciate it.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.025
This is the wrong kind of knife.

34:53.058 --> 34:56.870
- Carlyle was killed with a
double-edged blade.
- But his is missing.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.499
Caretaker picked it.

34:58.530 --> 35:02.273
Last time he saw Carlyle
with it was a couple of weeks ago.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.337
Big help there. What are you doing?

35:04.369 --> 35:06.610
Reading Hampton's FBI files.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.312
Eames: We passed his photo
and a description of his car

35:09.341 --> 35:11.844
around the neighborhood
of the marina. No pops.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.514
We need something.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.924
The City Police Liaison, the mayor's office,
the Department of Justice

35:16.948 --> 35:20.452
all feel very strongly
the FBI should not be messed with.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.328
We got him.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.936
This...

35:27.959 --> 35:32.032
Is the same kind of knife
that Carlyle kept in his boathouse.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.145
The knife that was used to kill him.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.169
- This a single-edged knife?
- Yes.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.513
Well, right there, he's wrong.

35:42.340 --> 35:45.651
The killer stabbed
the victim once with this knife,

35:45.677 --> 35:48.817
turned it around and
re-inserted it into the wound,

35:48.847 --> 35:50.827
this time with the sharp edge down.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.851
Why would he do that, Detective?

35:54.019 --> 35:57.990
So we would think the victim
was killed with a double-edged knife,

35:58.023 --> 36:00.970
a knife just like Eddie Dutton's.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.601
And Hampton thought his little trick

36:04.629 --> 36:07.075
would fool a forensic examination?

36:07.098 --> 36:09.203
Wouldn't have been the first time.

36:10.969 --> 36:14.576
The killer of a federal informant in Arizona

36:14.606 --> 36:17.678
was almost acquitted
because of an identical mistake

36:17.709 --> 36:20.212
made by a forensic examiner.

36:21.246 --> 36:23.852
Hampton knew that because...

36:23.882 --> 36:26.385
He was the lead investigator.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.295
It's in his file.

36:31.489 --> 36:34.265
I hope you appreciate
the fact that we stopped in here

36:34.292 --> 36:36.272
before going to Judge Gordino.

36:38.296 --> 36:40.071
(sighs)

36:41.833 --> 36:45.804
I'm not sure it's enough to convince me
to honor your arrest warrant.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.976
Then give him to us for a day.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.008
Just to question him.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.614
John: It's Goren.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.148
Frustrated second-rate city cop.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.923
You see the signs in their office?

36:58.950 --> 37:02.420
"World's Greatest Detectives," my ass.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.957
This whole thing is complete speculation.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.464
There was a reference, actually.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.872
To a case in your file.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.933
The Jo-Jo Benitez case.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.940
I brought you a federal
indictment against the Genoveses.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.646
I should be getting a medal.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.087
You didn't do it by yourself, John.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.090
The interview's set for tomorrow morning.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.686
Pick you up at 8:00. Be ready.

37:33.685 --> 37:37.326
( door opens, shuts )

37:40.325 --> 37:42.134
Lawyer: That's just fabulous.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.969
On top of everything else he's facing,

37:43.995 --> 37:45.633
you want him to perjure himself?

37:45.663 --> 37:47.506
Carver: There’ll be no perjury.

37:47.532 --> 37:49.603
He won't be under oath and his statements

37:49.634 --> 37:52.979
won't be offered as evidence
in any proceeding.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.984
All right, say he does help you

37:55.006 --> 37:57.145
with this murder investigation,

37:57.175 --> 37:58.984
what's in it for Mr. Russo?

37:59.010 --> 38:00.990
Besides the federal charges,

38:01.012 --> 38:05.085
these FBI operations
always give rise to state charges.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.995
We'll make sure they don't
in Mr. Russo's case.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.929
Hampton was my business partner.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.938
And he's my co-defendant.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.270
Not that loyalty's a big thing with me,

38:18.296 --> 38:21.106
but why should I help you hang
a murder rap on him?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.738
Because, Vinny, if you don't hang it on him,

38:23.768 --> 38:25.475
I'm going to hang it on you.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.454
What do you mean John's in the FBI?

38:32.477 --> 38:34.787
I think I would've known if he was a cop.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.817
Be that as it may, your father found
out he was an undercover FBI agent.

38:37.849 --> 38:40.921
He threatened to expose Hampton's
illegal activities to his superiors.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.061
Illegal activities?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.098
Giving Ms. Carlyle drugs,

38:47.125 --> 38:48.433
taking money from her,

38:48.459 --> 38:50.939
Threatening her former boyfriends.

38:52.831 --> 38:56.745
- What do you expect from Ms. Carlyle?
- We need her to testify against Hampton.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.913
I don't think you understand.
John's a victim here.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.046
Those gangsters victimized him.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.352
He didn't kill my father!

39:09.581 --> 39:11.925
I don't think that you understand.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.929
That Friday night there was
a problem in the coat room.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.769
Must've been around 5:30.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.139
I couldn't find Hampton anywhere.

39:26.164 --> 39:30.112
I even went out to the parking lot.
His car wasn't there.

39:30.134 --> 39:32.444
He didn't turn up until about 6:00.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.280
He told me we didn't have
to worry about Wharton Carlyle

39:35.306 --> 39:37.809
nosing around in our business anymore.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.528
Goren: Not bad.

39:52.991 --> 39:56.165
Beats a desk at the Phoenix field office.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.516
Give her a workout yet?

40:13.344 --> 40:15.620
You better not put it off John.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.684
The Department of Correction's strict

40:17.715 --> 40:20.662
about conjugal visits for convicted murderers.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.756
Trust me,

40:22.787 --> 40:25.666
you're a long way from making that stick.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.671
So you called this meeting,
what do you want?

40:28.693 --> 40:30.832
I want to give you a chance to do right.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.035
And what's doing right in the Goren playbook?

40:35.366 --> 40:38.347
Fidelity. Bravery. Integrity.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.349
Isn't that what it says on your FBI crest?

40:40.371 --> 40:43.318
You're going to give me
the good-agent-gone-bad speech?

40:46.044 --> 40:48.490
I just want to know what happened.

40:48.513 --> 40:51.460
Did you get tired of watching
the bad guys have all the fun?

40:52.550 --> 40:54.393
This is getting boring.

40:56.587 --> 40:59.067
Let me make it a little more exciting for you.

41:12.303 --> 41:16.342
My father was angry that John Hampton
was taking money from me

41:16.374 --> 41:18.786
and that we were having a relationship.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.417
He said that he could hurt John,

41:22.447 --> 41:25.326
and I repeated that to John

41:25.350 --> 41:27.489
and he got really angry.

41:27.518 --> 41:30.499
He knew Dad went rowing every morning.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.865
I even showed him where one time.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.344
By the time we clean her up,

41:42.367 --> 41:44.847
put her in a nice blue dress,

41:44.869 --> 41:47.213
she'll make a terrific witness.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.741
The remorseful daughter of the father

41:49.774 --> 41:52.584
that died trying to protect her.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.590
You used her, John.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.691
She was weak,

41:57.715 --> 41:59.717
and you used her.

42:01.986 --> 42:04.193
And that really pisses me off.

42:06.157 --> 42:10.299
I think it's time to think
about taking a plea.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.002
That crap's not going to fly.

42:26.477 --> 42:28.684
We're done. Get him out of here.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.784
- I'm sorry, John.
- What are you sorry about?

42:30.815 --> 42:32.886
John Hampton, you're under arrest for murder.

42:34.185 --> 42:37.166
You need me. You can't make
the case without me.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.395
It's no longer your concern.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.533
It's lonely at the bottom.

42:52.970 --> 42:55.041
( theme music playing )

42:56.305 --> 43:02.291
