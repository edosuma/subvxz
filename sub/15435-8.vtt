WEBVTT

00:00.460 --> 00:01.670
Previously on "brothers & sisters"...

00:01.690 --> 00:06.240
and I can't seem to get an answer
as to when or if she's coming back.

00:06.270 --> 00:09.700
I wanted to talk to you
about joe and the kiss.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.590
Oh,please. We are so past that.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.970
I may have led him on a little bit.

00:14.230 --> 00:17.800
did you,uh,tell jason about you
and scotty's little "slumber party"?

00:17.830 --> 00:18.770
No,actually.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.890
You are beyond pathetic.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.240
You spend so much time trying to get somebody
to love you that you can't help anybody.

00:23.260 --> 00:24.620
That's enough.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.810
I can't do this to my family.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.630
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

00:28.650 --> 00:30.330
Can you just go?

00:30.420 --> 00:32.159
I don't wanto wait to get married.

00:32.189 --> 00:34.140
I want to get married now.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.870
"From this moment,"

00:38.890 --> 00:40.750
"a moment like this,"

00:40.800 --> 00:42.110
"because you loved me."

00:42.140 --> 00:42.990
"Because you loved me"?

00:43.020 --> 00:44.400
Now how is that a good wedding song?

00:44.430 --> 00:45.710
It's past tense.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.220
And perfect for my marriage.

00:47.260 --> 00:48.950
Shouldn't your fiance be doing this?

00:48.980 --> 00:51.830
Well,I guess the second time
around,it sort of loses its allure.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.440
Yeah,it's like going
through the steps again.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.340
Speaking of which,I need
to apologize to rebecca.

00:55.370 --> 00:56.540
Yeah,she probably hates you.

00:56.550 --> 01:00.320
Oh,no,no,no. No one expects you to be
warm and fuzzy at your own intervention.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.740
Who wants a cookie?

01:01.790 --> 01:03.700
Mom,how's it going looking for a dress?

01:03.730 --> 01:04.970
It's so depressing.

01:04.989 --> 01:09.230
Every single mother of the bride
dress is beige or bedazzled,

01:09.250 --> 01:12.490
with all these necks and
sleeves and jackets and things.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.770
You get to be a certain age,and
they--they try to desex you.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.200
I mean,I might as well
be dressed in beige paper

01:18.220 --> 01:20.250
and headed off towards
the recycling bin.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.020
- How about ol' blue eyes?
- That's a good idea.

01:22.050 --> 01:26.610
No,no,we can't,we can't because robert's
first wedding was practically sinatra-themed.

01:26.630 --> 01:29.790
What about that beautiful
song by the dixie chicks?

01:29.820 --> 01:31.860
At a republican candidate's wedding?

01:31.880 --> 01:33.110
Well,if you rule out every democrat,

01:33.140 --> 01:37.150
you're basically left with ted
nugent,lynyrd skynyrd and zz top.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.400
Well,I'm a democrat,and I lost
my virginity to "she's got legs."

01:40.430 --> 01:42.750
- Oh,god!
- Crossing a le,sarah.

01:42.780 --> 01:45.190
Mine was the "dirty dancing" theme.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.930
No! Be gayer.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.770
I bet kitty's was talk radio.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.380
hey. Justin?

01:53.410 --> 01:55.890
Don't look at me. I'm not having
this conversation in front of mom.

01:55.910 --> 01:56.820
- come on.
- Oh,please.

01:56.870 --> 02:01.970
Uh,uh,pink floyd's "the wall,"
gabby kleiner,the tenth grade.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.020
Are you...
you--you heard that?

02:04.320 --> 02:06.940
thanks. I have two first-sex
soundtracks,girl and guy.

02:06.970 --> 02:08.770
Okay,now stop. Stop,you guys,please.

02:08.810 --> 02:10.750
You're ruining all music for me.

02:10.780 --> 02:13.020
Sorry I'm late.What's up,buddy?

02:13.070 --> 02:15.370
Robert,what song did you
lose your virginity to?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.650
Mom.

02:17.270 --> 02:20.220
Well,we're just trying to
figure out our wedding song.

02:20.370 --> 02:21.910
Interesting methodology.

02:21.930 --> 02:24.350
Um,"endless love."

02:25.800 --> 02:27.550
yeah,okay. Um,bad news.

02:27.590 --> 02:30.190
I spoke to jason,and he
can't come to the wedding.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.490
You spoke with jason?

02:31.530 --> 02:34.760
Yeah,uh,briefly. And then the
other day,we got completely cut off.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.470
The other day?

02:36.510 --> 02:39.220
I haven't spoken to him in
weeks,and he's called you twice?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.190
He was gonna be my best man.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.600
Oh,well--well,the
next time you two chat,

02:43.640 --> 02:45.590
maybe you could tell him
his committed,monogamous,

02:45.620 --> 02:48.670
yet highly sought
after boyfriend says hi.

02:49.940 --> 02:53.760
So does everybody know that kitty
has us scheduled for dance lessons?

02:53.780 --> 02:55.570
Ballroom dancing? Kitty,pleasE.

02:55.590 --> 02:58.050
Come on,tommy. I'm not that bad.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.390
I've got it. I've got
it-- "pretty woman."

03:02.420 --> 03:05.510
No,thanks,mom,but that will make
me come off a little conceited.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.450
No,no,no. I mean,that
was my first time song.

03:08.490 --> 03:09.830
I can't believe I remember that.

03:09.860 --> 03:11.600
Mom,we don't need to
picture you and dad.

03:11.630 --> 03:12.890
Who said anything about dad?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.140
- What?!
- mom!

03:14.160 --> 03:16.880
- wait a minute. Wait a minute. I thought dad was your first.
- No.

03:16.910 --> 03:20.880
- I thought dad swept you off your feet when you were barely 18.
- No.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.700
Mom,you sluT.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.830
it was the '60s.

03:24.870 --> 03:29.290
It was this-- this guy I'd known
in high school--stan harris.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.930
he got drafted and--and
went off to canada.

03:32.970 --> 03:36.680
- It was in the backseat of his dad's cutlass...
- oh,my god.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.230
- and he was tall,and I
was short-- -  I gotta go.

03:39.270 --> 03:41.900
- I'm gonna make more
popcorn. - thank you. I'm--

03:42.330 --> 03:47.350
Fine. Fine. So what,I-I guess
I've just never had sex before?

03:51.660 --> 03:52.670
that doesn't look safe.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.870
- It lowers your blood pressure.
- Yep?

03:54.910 --> 03:57.830
So does a glass of wine with
far less risk of paralysis.

03:57.870 --> 03:58.770
Why aren't you working?

03:58.800 --> 04:00.240
I'm on days.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.930
We could go back to writing notes
if actual conversation is too weird.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.100
Oh,sorry. No messages.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.730
of course not.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.450
Do you wanna be my date
for kitty's wedding?

04:18.490 --> 04:20.480
Oh,how appealing. A spite invite?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.570
No.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.340
Yes. A-a little.

04:24.370 --> 04:26.330
You know going to a
wedding alone is torture.

04:26.380 --> 04:27.320
What about jason?

04:27.360 --> 04:29.470
Reverend "god forbid I call
you back" won't be there.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.540
Yeah,but his brother robert will.

04:31.590 --> 04:32.750
What will he think?

04:32.780 --> 04:34.240
Who cares?

04:34.290 --> 04:36.570
Miatello's is catering.

04:36.940 --> 04:40.430
They're serving those little gorgonzola
and potato pizzas with saffron and sage.

04:40.470 --> 04:41.950
You had me at "gorgonzola."

04:41.990 --> 04:43.490
Thought so.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.150
kitty. Hi.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.590
Hi. Um,I'm sorry.

04:50.630 --> 04:52.530
I-I hope I didn't wake you up.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.700
No,no,I've been up for a while.

04:56.950 --> 04:58.530
Um,well,do you wanna come in?

04:58.580 --> 04:59.670
Sure.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.280
Yeah,c-come in.

05:03.180 --> 05:04.420
Um,is justin okay?

05:04.470 --> 05:07.140
- Yeah,actually,you know,he's--he's
doing much better. - Oh,good.

05:07.170 --> 05:11.680
And you know what? Thank you,by the way,for
letting everybody know what was going on.

05:11.710 --> 05:15.410
And I-I know he--he said some
really awful things to you.

05:15.450 --> 05:17.500
No,he said awful
things to everyone,so...

05:17.550 --> 05:18.540
actually,he did.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.170
But,you know,it's just...

05:21.200 --> 05:25.030
if it hadn't been for you,we wouldn't
have been able to help him and...

05:25.060 --> 05:27.110
so anyway,the reason
that I'm here is that¡ª

05:27.140 --> 05:32.860
and there's no pressure,and you can
definitely say no if you feel uncomfortable¡ª

05:32.890 --> 05:37.850
but I just wondered if maybe by any chance
you would want to be one of my bridesmaids?

05:38.460 --> 05:39.810
Oh,my god.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.310
Well,I-I dn't even know if
I'd be invited to the wedding.

05:43.340 --> 05:44.470
Are you crazy? Well,of course.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.950
Of course you're invited to the wedding.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.870
You're my--you're
my sister.

05:48.210 --> 05:51.030
Well,is sa--is
sarah okay with it?

05:51.070 --> 05:52.730
- I mean... - yeah.
You know,who--who cares?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.250
She'll--she'll
be fine.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.070
Yes? No? Maybe?

05:56.110 --> 05:58.080
- You can think about it if
you want.  -Yeah,I--I'd love to.

05:58.110 --> 05:58.910
- Really?
-Yeah.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.240
That's great.

06:03.510 --> 06:04.580
Should we hug?

06:04.630 --> 06:05.370
Sure.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.840
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.890
Graham has quite a reputation
for growing midsized companies.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.870
Well,graham,reputation aside,

06:14.890 --> 06:17.860
ojai's not looking to re any
outside consultants at this time.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.910
Right. Well,that's
usually the first response.

06:19.950 --> 06:23.050
Saul tells me that you wanna
branch out into the organic market?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.370
Yes,that's something that
we've been considering.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.040
Let me give you some
free advice--don'T.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.990
Every other vendor's
already noticed that trend,

06:30.020 --> 06:31.650
so,uh,you're a little
behind the curve there.

06:31.660 --> 06:33.910
And frankly,sarah,overhauling
our farming practices

06:33.940 --> 06:37.040
would cost a hell of a lot more
than hiring a private consultant.

06:37.070 --> 06:39.370
Graham has some ideas about
the international market.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.210
Well,that's right.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.540
Uh,namely,china.

06:41.580 --> 06:44.600
It's a booming economy,it's
an expanding middle class¡ª

06:44.620 --> 06:47.240
I've read all the same
journals that you have.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.160
Well,actually,I just
came back from there.

06:49.190 --> 06:49.940
Have you been?

06:49.970 --> 06:50.880
No,I haven'T.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.190
Well,you gotta go.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.560
The upscale markets in shanghai
just can't handle the demand.

06:55.590 --> 07:01.480
Just the word "california" transforms the
everyday grape into,uh,a,uh,luxury item.

07:01.510 --> 07:05.110
Well,just the word "china," for
me,conjures up a logistical nightmare.

07:05.140 --> 07:09.870
And ojai doesn't have the human resources
to overcome international licensing,tariffs¡ª

07:09.890 --> 07:10.800
yeah,well,that's just what I do.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.690
I mean,I can help you
navigate that whole thing.

07:12.730 --> 07:17.460
Exactly,and thewe create a special
division of ojai to handle foreign sales.

07:20.450 --> 07:21.800
Leave your proposal.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.780
I'll call you if I have any questions.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.630
Okay,well,thanks for your time,sarah.

07:25.670 --> 07:26.630
Great to meet you.

07:26.670 --> 07:28.690
Thanks for the free advice.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.180
I'll be in touch.

07:31.630 --> 07:35.080
Okay,great,I will fax you a price list.

07:35.410 --> 07:36.660
Bye.

07:37.330 --> 07:38.650
Hey.

07:38.980 --> 07:39.760
how you doing?

07:39.800 --> 07:42.060
I have been fielding
phone calls all morning.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.100
Now correct me if I'm wrong,but
didn't we hire lena to do that?

07:46.140 --> 07:47.560
Oh,she's probably running late.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.260
Is she,or are you guys
doing that thing you do

07:50.280 --> 07:52.140
where she comes five minutes after you

07:52.180 --> 07:53.580
so that I don't know
that the two of you¡ª

07:53.630 --> 07:56.880
no,no,no,I,uh,I ended things with her.

07:59.870 --> 08:03.590
Should we be looking
for a new office manager?

08:04.730 --> 08:06.050
Sorry.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.150
I stopped for pastries.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.510
Tommy,I got your favorite.

08:10.580 --> 08:11.960
Bear claws.

08:13.270 --> 08:14.850
walker landing.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.440
Yeah,he's right here.

08:16.850 --> 08:18.300
It's your wife.

08:21.070 --> 08:22.330
Julia,hey.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.110
What's up?

08:23.150 --> 08:25.080
Elizabeth wanted to talk to her daddy.

08:25.140 --> 08:27.090
Yeah. Put her on.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.300
hey,honey.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.799
hi.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.470
Oh,my god.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.900
I was gonna call yesterday,

08:37.929 --> 08:42.340
but I thought a surprise
would be...surprising.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.159
Wow,it's so good to see you.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.770
Yeah,you,too.

08:47.310 --> 08:48.260
And her.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.030
Oh,my god. She's so big! Hi!

08:51.070 --> 08:52.340
Welcome home,julia.

08:52.390 --> 08:55.350
- She's incredible.
- Thanks.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.480
- The place looks so good.
- Thanks.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.360
uh,this is lena,our office manager.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.770
Oh,of course. Hi.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.430
It's nice to put a face to the voice.

09:06.450 --> 09:07.690
Yeah.

09:09.510 --> 09:13.460
All right,well,I'm gonna leave
for the day and get them settled.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.860
Take as much time as you need.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.170
- Thanks,holly.
- sure.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.150
all right,let's go.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.010
Okay.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.850
By it was nice to meet you,lena.

09:20.880 --> 09:21.970
You,too.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.710
I'll,um,I'll--I'll
check in later.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.850
you still wa the job?

09:35.070 --> 09:38.280
You might want to
rethink the work wardrobe.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.550
Saul,do you remember stan harris?

09:49.580 --> 09:50.710
Of course I remember him.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.860
Mother was convinced that
he was gonna ruin you.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.810
That's because I told her we were
gonna travel around the country

09:55.840 --> 09:58.580
in his volkswagen bus
and join a commune.

09:58.610 --> 09:59.810
- I googled him.
- You what?

09:59.850 --> 10:04.150
Get this--he's history
teacher at canyon falls high.

10:04.180 --> 10:04.850
He's single.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.820
Whoa,whoa,whoa. Back up.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.040
Since when does google tell you
what someone's marital status is?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.600
I... e-mailed him.

10:11.610 --> 10:12.440
I couldn't help myself.

10:12.490 --> 10:15.440
I might've been this whole other
person if he hadn't gone to canada.

10:15.470 --> 10:18.220
He lives 15 minutes
away. Can you believe it?

10:18.240 --> 10:20.070
You know what? He
asked me out to dinner.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.430
That's impressive.

10:21.450 --> 10:24.710
I shouldn't go,not in a million years.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.310
We'll have nothing to talk about.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.490
What if he looks old? What
if he thinks i look old?

10:28.530 --> 10:31.320
Oh,nora,come on. You
don't look that old.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.640
Well,then again,what have I got to lose?

10:34.940 --> 10:36.250
I mean,there's history there.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.790
What if that same old
spark still exists?

10:38.820 --> 10:40.700
It could still exist. You know that.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.510
I know that?

10:42.530 --> 10:44.350
- What are you doing,nora?
- What?

10:44.380 --> 10:46.050
I told you that I didn't
want to talk about this,

10:46.060 --> 10:47.770
that I needed time to talk about this.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.900
You want me to get in touch with the
guy that I told you about? Is that it?

10:50.910 --> 10:52.590
Is that why you're
mentioning stan harris,nora?

10:52.620 --> 10:55.200
No,I brought up stan because I
wanted to talk to you about stan.

10:55.240 --> 10:55.780
Yeah,right.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.060
Look,don't get me wrong.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.250
I do think we have to talk about this.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.890
I mean,you can't tell me that you were in love
with a man once and then we never discuss it again.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.690
We have to talk about it eventually.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.260
You know what,nora? I gotta go.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.860
Well,saul,ould
I--should I go...

11:11.000 --> 11:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:26.610 --> 11:30.110
Oh,well,you know,they're--
they're just showing off,right?

11:31.330 --> 11:33.860
I can tell you,we're not gonna
be doing anything like that.

11:43.940 --> 11:46.470
Wow,that--that was-- that
was really,really good.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.500
That was amazing,and--and
thank you,

11:48.530 --> 11:51.490
but I don't think that we're
gonna be needing anything...

11:51.520 --> 11:52.780
don't worry about it,senator.

11:52.810 --> 11:55.400
We'll adjust the steps to your song.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.530
Well,you know what? We don't
even really have a-a song yet.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.410
We--we just wanna
learn a couple of steps

12:01.460 --> 12:04.100
so we don't look like complete
morons at our--our wedding.

12:04.130 --> 12:04.830
Exactly.

12:04.870 --> 12:05.620
Okay.

12:05.650 --> 12:07.020
Whatever you wish.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.720
Martena,just play a
slow fox-trot,please.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.980
just watch it once.

12:10.990 --> 12:14.970
It's slow,slow,quick,quick.

12:15.010 --> 12:18.490
Let's try it all in one
line,starting with the left foot.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.450
And...
slow--

12:20.480 --> 12:21.390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.070
Um,so it's--so it's-- so
it's left,right and then-

12:24.090 --> 12:26.170
- and then which--which side? -
no,no,for you,kitty,it's the opposite.

12:26.190 --> 12:28.870
See,you go right,left,side,together.

12:28.880 --> 12:29.550
Hello?

12:29.580 --> 12:32.240
So--oh,it's opp--oh,I
didn't--nobody told me that.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.370
No problem. That's what we're here for.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.270
Okay,okay,um,let's see. (Yeah,and
I'll get back. Thank you.)

12:35.310 --> 12:37.450
So it's right...left.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.450
and then to the side.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.500
- Good. That's good,but to the other side.
- The other side.

12:40.540 --> 12:41.600
That was the majority leader.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.080
Yeah,well,you're in the minority
party,so you can call him back.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.380
All right,let's try
it facing each other.

12:46.410 --> 12:47.800
Okay.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.260
kitty...His face is much more
attractive thanour feet. Huh?

12:53.290 --> 12:54.570
Head up,please.

12:54.620 --> 12:58.120
Slow,slow,quick,quick.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.500
Senator,you're a natural.

13:01.540 --> 13:02.510
Thank you.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.650
Kitty,please stopeading.

13:04.690 --> 13:06.150
Oh,sorry. I'm sorry.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.530
You know,it's just--it's--it's
in my nature,but I'm trying.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.860
Okay,and this is gonna
take a long time,isn't it?

13:09.890 --> 13:12.140
You know what? He just gave us
the steps,like,three seconds ago.

13:12.170 --> 13:14.290
They're two votes down on S.R. 7550.

13:14.330 --> 13:15.760
Don't you think I should
spend some time on that?

13:15.790 --> 13:17.570
You know what? You never
told me you could dance.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.340
You know,inaugurals,state dinners...

13:20.370 --> 13:22.230
and first weddings. Right. I get it.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.490
I think I have the steps in order.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.680
You should stay,rehearse.

13:24.710 --> 13:25.550
Reschedule.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.330
I'll make the time. Promise.

13:27.370 --> 13:29.200
Thank you. I appreciate
it,but I've gotta go.

13:29.230 --> 13:31.400
Okay,kitty. Let's dance.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.460
Five,six,seven,eight.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.490
Slow.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.440
Good,good.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.490
Hey. Sorry about the mess.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.070
If I would've known you were
coming,I would've cleaned uP.

13:41.080 --> 13:41.990
that's okay.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.770
Yeah,I guess I,uh,I reverted.

13:44.810 --> 13:46.120
You're allowed.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.620
I'm sorry I was... gone so long.

13:51.070 --> 13:52.650
You had a lot to sort out.

13:52.660 --> 13:56.510
I just--I wish I could take
back so many things that I said.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.730
I know.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.180
Me,too.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.220
Can we go back...

14:02.370 --> 14:04.290
to the way things were?

14:04.330 --> 14:08.540
I want to,so bad.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.810
You have no idea.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.640
I come with decadence.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.350
What happened? Did you rob
the long beach aquarium?

14:18.380 --> 14:22.040
We had a chichi 6-year-oldirthday
party at the restaant--

14:22.060 --> 14:23.000
"little mermaid" theme.

14:23.040 --> 14:26.170
Turns out the kids couldn't
bear to eat sebastian.

14:27.830 --> 14:29.480
The mermaid's best friend?

14:30.350 --> 14:34.050
- Anyhow,their drama,our dinner.
- Great.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.220
Uh,would sebastian like a
little melted butter on the side?

14:36.270 --> 14:37.750
I don't know,but I would. Marvelous.

14:37.780 --> 14:39.460
Light some candles. I'll be right back.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.960
Oh,candles?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.730
I mean,it's just
takeout,when you think of it.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.000
Yeah,sure. Yeah,sure,no candles.

14:46.030 --> 14:49.360
Uh.. well,we can still
have champagne,right?

14:49.400 --> 14:50.390
Sure.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.140
- Hey,sarah.
- Hey.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.410
Is--is
kitty here?

14:59.490 --> 15:01.030
Oh,she'll be down in a minute.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.620
So are--are you
the maid of honor?

15:02.670 --> 15:04.630
Well,I'm certainly not
the matron of honor.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.430
I'm--I'm
sorry.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.940
Okay. Well?

15:09.060 --> 15:10.520
Well,what do you think?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.050
- Gorgeous.
- Really?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.800
Yeah,it's--it's got this
great '60s vibe to it. I mean--

15:15.820 --> 15:17.540
that's because it's from the '60s.

15:17.570 --> 15:18.660
well,is it too '60s?

15:18.710 --> 15:21.670
No. No,I think it's classic.

15:21.710 --> 15:23.880
No,no,what I meant by
that is it's very jackie O.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.430
I don't know if that's the look
I'm going for on my wedding day.

15:26.460 --> 15:29.050
I mean,that's not even
the right political party.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.130
Oh,I'm just gonna stop talking.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.610
- oh,you look gorgeous.
- Really?

15:33.640 --> 15:34.860
Just gorgeous,really.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.020
Speaking of gorgeous...mom,where
are you going?

15:37.050 --> 15:37.830
Well,yeah?

15:37.860 --> 15:39.810
Oh,just,um,dinner with a friend.

15:39.850 --> 15:41.170
Honey,this is so exciting.

15:41.210 --> 15:43.320
- We'll take you tomorrow to the alterations person...
- okay.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.240
- And just,you know,a few tiny little things,okay?
- Okay.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.670
It's exciting.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.700
I have to go. It's so exciting.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.130
Have fun.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.730
Let's seE.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.220
Well,you know,I-I think there actually
really is something amazing about the--

15:56.250 --> 15:58.940
- the history...Of this dress.
- yeah

15:58.970 --> 16:00.400
And--and
it's free.

16:01.140 --> 16:02.040
Can't beat that.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.510
Is that mom's dress?

16:03.560 --> 16:06.720
Yeah,it's-- it's
great... right?

16:06.930 --> 16:08.730
Yeah. Looks good.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.600
Can I,uh,can i steal
rebecca for a second?

16:11.630 --> 16:13.380
Look,justin,I know what you're doing,

16:13.430 --> 16:16.320
and I just want you know
that-- that it's fine.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.070
I'm fine.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.640
Look,it's not fin okay?

16:18.670 --> 16:20.420
I-I feel horrible about what I said.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.280
It was hurtful and it was mean.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.630
And some of it was true.

16:23.690 --> 16:24.790
I was angry,okay?

16:24.830 --> 16:25.900
And I took a cheap shot at you.

16:25.930 --> 16:27.000
You are not pathetic.

16:27.030 --> 16:27.830
I'm pathetic,okay?

16:27.880 --> 16:30.000
If it weren't for you,I-I
wouldn't be getting clea

16:30.040 --> 16:33.820
I'm just happy you're getting
the help that you need,you know?

16:34.390 --> 16:36.990
I want you to know how
important you are to me

16:37.020 --> 16:40.000
and how deeply,deeply sorry I am.

16:41.700 --> 16:45.580
wow,you're really good at this
whole making amends thing,aren't you?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.140
I've had some practice.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.920
I--oh,excuse
me.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.770
hello?

16:54.320 --> 16:56.750
Uh,yeah. How are you?

16:58.280 --> 17:00.800
Sure. Yeah. That,uh,that sounds great.

17:00.850 --> 17:01.940
I'll see you there.

17:01.970 --> 17:03.320
All right,bye.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.170
that was your friend lena.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.599
What did--what'd
she want?

17:07.640 --> 17:10.339
I don't know. She just
asked me out for coffee.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.160
hi,I'm--I'm
looking for someone.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.650
Right in here.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.280
Stan?

17:22.560 --> 17:23.849
Nora!

17:23.890 --> 17:27.069
- hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
- No,no,no.

17:27.109 --> 17:28.750
- no?
- Ah,ten minutes.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.950
Oh,traffic in this city
is absolutely impossible.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.240
You can't get anywhere,ever.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.820
If you're invited to go someplace
between the hours of 5:00 and 7:00,

17:34.850 --> 17:36.090
I have to tell them, no,I'm sorry.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.690
You can't get there from
here. You just can'T..

17:40.000 --> 17:41.430
I'm here.

17:42.820 --> 17:45.090
you look beautiful.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.520
Yeah,well,don't look to close.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.630
My neck looks like
someone's bedroom curtains.

17:49.670 --> 17:53.860
Hey,listen,I-I gained 20 pounds
and I've got a artificial hip.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.800
- Really?
- No. Kidding.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.220
I'm sorry,nora.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.400
I--I'm a little
bit nervous.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.440
I'm nervous,too.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.300
I can't believe you e-mailed me.

18:05.340 --> 18:06.610
Did I do that?

18:06.660 --> 18:07.770
you did.

18:11.250 --> 18:15.330
I... where do we even start?

18:15.370 --> 18:20.140
Um... how about a pitcher of margaritas?

18:20.170 --> 18:21.180
Yes.

18:21.220 --> 18:23.510
- We're at this immigration rally.
- Right.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.660
Ah,you know,all my kids.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.830
I mean,my class.

18:27.860 --> 18:29.320
There's this
one--alonzo.

18:29.350 --> 18:33.900
He's really smart,but he's,uh,you
know,a little unfocused.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.180
And I'm watching him.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.500
And I'm seeing that he--he's a little
bit affected by this,maybe a lot.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.180
And I'm thinking,"this
is why I do this."

18:43.240 --> 18:45.090
He's starting to think.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.050
He--he wants to demand his
right to be heard,you know?

18:48.100 --> 18:49.810
- And just at that moment...
- yeah?

18:49.850 --> 18:51.550
- He gets on the stage...
- yeah?

18:51.580 --> 18:55.980
- Drops his pants and moons the governor.
- oh,no!

18:56.010 --> 18:57.670
- Yeah.
- oh,no!

18:57.720 --> 19:00.800
I didn't want him to feel
humiliated,so I get up and I join him.

19:00.850 --> 19:02.420
oh,god!

19:02.460 --> 19:05.070
That's horrible!

19:05.110 --> 19:06.630
what happened?

19:06.680 --> 19:09.860
Well,you know,I spent a night
in detention,paid a fine.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.560
Alonzo,I think,is running for
president of the school now.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.250
Well,good for him.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.760
I-I spent a night in jail.

19:18.270 --> 19:23.610
well,I got caught smoking a joint with
my girlfriend in her car-- emily craft.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.980
Crafty?

19:25.030 --> 19:26.740
Hey,you never-- you
never liked grass.

19:26.780 --> 19:28.070
Oh,when did you pick up that habit?

19:28.120 --> 19:28.920
Never.

19:28.950 --> 19:29.850
Are you kidding?

19:29.880 --> 19:30.880
Since last you saw me,

19:30.910 --> 19:35.590
all i've been doing is raising kids
and being married to a republican,so...

19:35.630 --> 19:37.760
yeah,I knew that.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.390
So you never got married?

19:40.440 --> 19:43.130
No,I-I-I,you know,I came
close a couple of times,

19:43.160 --> 19:46.100
but I don't think I ever
really found the right person.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.470
Yeah,the right person.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.850
what are you doing tomorrow night?

19:54.910 --> 19:58.020
I'm sorry. I know you've got
plans,it's too soon. I'm--I'm just...

19:58.050 --> 20:02.850
no,no. My goodness,at this
age,almost nothing is too soon.

20:04.150 --> 20:07.320
Yes,let'S... let's do it.

20:07.350 --> 20:08.710
Let's go out.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.540
Good,'cause I couldn't stand
to wait another 40 years

20:17.940 --> 20:19.360
kevin.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.030
kevin. Go to bed.

20:23.070 --> 20:26.030
Actually,could you take your foot out?

20:26.070 --> 20:28.110
- It's digging
right into-- - sorry.

20:38.310 --> 20:40.530
I should go to my air mattress.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.310
yeah,you should.

21:02.070 --> 21:03.370
I really like th on you.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.490
Come on,I look like a giant tangerine.

21:06.950 --> 21:09.600
uh,I gotta take that.I'm working.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.900
I'm gonna get a couple more drses.

21:13.820 --> 21:14.980
sarah walker.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.360
Hey,it's graham finch.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.010
Listen,I--I've been
thinking about our meeting.

21:18.130 --> 21:19.200
I hope I didn't come on too strong.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.330
Bulldozer isn't your normal speed?

21:21.440 --> 21:23.120
Well,that's me.You know,I'm aggressive.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.300
I see something I want,I go
for it.That's why you want me.

21:25.430 --> 21:27.540
- Oh,now I want you?
- Figure of speech.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.320
So what are you doing tonight?You
wanna have some dinner?

21:29.430 --> 21:30.490
Uh,I have plans.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.010
Well,then how about tomorrow night?

21:32.120 --> 21:34.050
Listen,just give me an hour,

21:34.180 --> 21:37.470
and if I can't convince
you,uh,you'll never see me again.

21:37.570 --> 21:38.960
What do you say?

21:39.620 --> 21:43.070
- Okay,tomorrow night it is.
- Great.See you then.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.970
- oh,don't you like that?
- It's a pretty color,I guess.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.570
what do you think of this one?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.970
Oh,wow,I--that color
is so much better.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.560
- really?
- Oh,totally.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.220
Now how come you're not
bringing anybody to the wedding?

21:53.330 --> 21:55.650
Oh,you know,it's been a
bit of a dry spell lately.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.960
Dry spell?That doesn't sound like you.

21:58.000 --> 21:58.990
What does that mean?

21:59.040 --> 22:02.180
Just that when I think of you,I
don't think of "dry spell."

22:02.350 --> 22:05.790
You know,I do know a couple of
really cute guys in my office.

22:05.900 --> 22:06.960
Do you have type?

22:07.050 --> 22:08.500
No,I don't really have a type.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.890
Except for married men,right,sarah?

22:10.010 --> 22:11.080
That's what you were gonna say?

22:11.190 --> 22:14.000
- No. No,she wasn'T.
- I would never say that.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.740
Hmm,well,there goes that
foot in my mouth again.

22:17.860 --> 22:20.830
It's not that I don't
think about it occasionally.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.060
It's just that I've long stopped
obsessing about you,joe and my divorce.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.170
What I am obsessed about is kitty,

22:25.280 --> 22:27.670
her wedding and which dress
she's gonna force me to wear.

22:27.790 --> 22:29.380
Right,kit?

22:29.490 --> 22:31.530
This is it.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.610
This is the one.

22:33.740 --> 22:34.830
oh!

22:34.950 --> 22:36.360
oh,my god.

22:36.490 --> 22:38.320
Can you believe it?

22:38.460 --> 22:41.400
- It's perfect.
- it's perfect.

22:41.530 --> 22:43.470
what about mom's dress?

22:43.600 --> 22:46.810
Oh,well,no.No,I mean,it would be the
one if I didn't already have the one.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.740
- Oh,you're right.
- But oh,my god.

22:48.850 --> 22:50.930
- Just try it on.
- No,no,I can'T.I can'T.

22:51.050 --> 22:52.890
It would be cheating.I
shouldn't even be looking at it.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.880
Oh,come on.Looking's not cheating...

22:54.990 --> 22:56.690
is it,rebecca?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.190
Oh,my god.

23:02.050 --> 23:03.580
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:04.130 --> 23:05.370
You going to the gym?

23:05.490 --> 23:09.570
Yeah,have to.Working in the kitchen
demands it,or you end up,you know,with-

23:09.690 --> 23:11.630
I know,with love handles like me.

23:13.490 --> 23:16.860
I think we've already established
I have no problems with your body.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.110
Nor I yours.

23:22.810 --> 23:26.040
- Look,about last night
- you don't have to say anything.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.490
I know what happened.You
were vulnerable.

23:28.620 --> 23:32.550
Your boyfriend's a million miles away,and
I was a warm body after lobster dinner.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.870
Add champagne and voila...

23:36.000 --> 23:38.230
- mistake sex.
- What if it wasn't a mistake?

23:38.350 --> 23:40.180
Kevin,you don't have
to make me feel better

23:40.280 --> 23:43.280
by turning yesterday's nostalgic sex
romp into something that it wasn'T.

23:43.390 --> 23:44.730
I'm not.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.440
Believe me,I'm not.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.910
Yes,of course I miss
him.You know,why wouldn't I?

23:49.010 --> 23:52.780
He's not calling me.But it's like what
we had,he's put into this compartment,

23:52.900 --> 23:54.200
and now he's gone
back to his first love,

23:54.310 --> 23:58.060
which is god or the church
or--or something.I don't know.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.950
- But it's certainly not me. - You
don't know that.When people are far away-

24:01.060 --> 24:04.490
look,I know how I feel,so
just let me feel that way.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.200
It hurts.

24:11.690 --> 24:13.110
Hey.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.310
It'll be all right.I promise.

24:18.220 --> 24:19.800
I'm not so sure.

24:20.340 --> 24:21.210
what is this?

24:21.330 --> 24:23.740
We go on a lovely picnic at the beach,

24:23.840 --> 24:28.020
and then you bring me out here
for what,a gang initiation?

24:28.470 --> 24:29.840
Take a closer look.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.480
All right.

24:32.780 --> 24:34.490
Oh,it's jones hall.

24:37.290 --> 24:39.560
we saw dylan here.

24:39.670 --> 24:40.650
yeah.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.450
Oh,my god.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.710
Yeah,the memory of that night...

24:44.830 --> 24:48.040
has gotten me through a lot
of cold winters in toronto.

24:49.810 --> 24:52.020
it was my first time,you know.

24:53.060 --> 24:54.750
it was our first time.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.800
I lied.I didn't want you to think
I didn't know what I was doing.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.330
oh,stan,I was so madly in love with you.

25:02.450 --> 25:04.130
Why did you leave?

25:04.260 --> 25:05.240
You ran off to canada.

25:05.370 --> 25:09.570
You left everything-- your
family,your friends,me.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.210
I-I wasn't enough for you.

25:12.350 --> 25:14.600
What are you talking about?

25:16.430 --> 25:18.820
you love the fight you can't win.

25:19.130 --> 25:20.230
But you already had me.

25:20.350 --> 25:23.170
I mean,even then I knew
I wasn't a challenge.

25:23.290 --> 25:25.520
I wasn't looking for a challenge.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.450
- Weren't you?
- No.

25:27.680 --> 25:32.520
You married a rich republican,somebody
you can always argue with.

25:36.940 --> 25:38.320
We're different.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.660
I mean,I-I don't like the fight.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.300
I'm committed to the cause.

25:48.490 --> 25:51.850
stan...will you come
see my life,meet my kids?

25:52.830 --> 25:56.140
Will you come with me
to my daughter's wedding?

25:56.460 --> 25:58.540
I'd be honored.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.720
Will your mother be there?

26:02.330 --> 26:03.940
um,yeah.

26:04.050 --> 26:06.160
oh,boy.

26:07.170 --> 26:10.810
oh,god,I love this song,still.

26:10.910 --> 26:12.950
so do I.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.300
why are you calling me at home?

26:37.440 --> 26:41.260
Hey,I just checked the office voice
mail,and your brunch meeting canceled.

26:42.180 --> 26:46.330
Yeah,and listen,by the way,I'm not gonna
be bothering you with personal calls.

26:46.340 --> 26:48.110
I'm not that dense.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.130
So just relax.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.710
I'm--I'm--I'm
sorry.Thanks.

26:52.830 --> 26:54.670
Have a good weekend.

27:03.590 --> 27:05.370
who's calling so early?

27:05.510 --> 27:08.820
Uh,that was the office.They
canceled my meeting.

27:08.940 --> 27:12.530
So,um,I could make breakfast.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.290
I wouldn't have pegged
you for a half-caff.

27:16.410 --> 27:18.120
I would've assumed an extra shot.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.830
Yeah,well,I'm-- I'm
working on moderation.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.160
Really?

27:22.710 --> 27:24.830
That doesn't sound like
the guy I met at the bar.

27:24.950 --> 27:27.650
Uh,I guess rebecca didn't tell you.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.340
No.

27:29.470 --> 27:31.430
I'm--I'm
in recovery.

27:31.550 --> 27:35.730
I was taking pain medication
for my leg,and pretty soon after,

27:35.840 --> 27:37.750
I just started taking
it just to take it.

27:37.860 --> 27:40.370
And now I've been in
detox for a few weeks,

27:40.510 --> 27:42.090
and going to meetings,talking
to my sponsor.

27:42.220 --> 27:43.790
And if you want to run,I
completely understand.

27:43.910 --> 27:46.450
No,listen,I don't get
scared off that easy.

27:46.570 --> 27:48.870
I'm a pathetic loser
who dates a married guy,

27:48.990 --> 27:51.170
and then gets surprised
and bummed when I t dumped.

27:51.290 --> 27:52.800
Wow,that sucks.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.070
Yeah,well... it was kind of
doomed from the start,you know?

27:56.190 --> 27:58.620
I want you to know that I'm a
terrible choice for a rebound guy.

27:58.750 --> 28:02.070
I mean,not--not assuming,you know,that
this is anything past coffee or...

28:02.190 --> 28:04.470
no,go ahead,assume.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.800
I just thought,you know,I shouldn't
get involved while I'm getting sober.

28:06.930 --> 28:09.940
I still have nightmares about combat.

28:10.070 --> 28:12.330
My leg still looks pretty
gnarly from my injury.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.040
I don't have a job
and I live with my mom.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.340
- You can stop.You're an awful choice.
- Yeah

28:17.650 --> 28:22.400
So how aboutust being,you
know,my rebound caffeine buddy?

28:22.530 --> 28:24.770
Well,as long as you
don't mind the half-caff.

28:25.430 --> 28:28.500
No... not at all.

28:30.060 --> 28:32.510
And slow,slow...

28:33.000 --> 28:34.070
quick,quick.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.870
you know,it's tough to
replace a quarter of the staff,

28:36.010 --> 28:39.130
- but stolarski comes highly recommended.
- He worked for phipps.

28:39.140 --> 28:39.950
Yeah,we can't have that.

28:40.090 --> 28:42.450
Okay,well,there's donnelly,but
I hear he's a bit of a screamer.

28:42.570 --> 28:43.230
- What--why are you stepping
on my feet? - You know what?

28:43.340 --> 28:47.270
Travis' voice keeps boring into the part
of my brain that is trying to keep count.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.470
I wasn't aware you had that part.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.050
Oh,would you shut up,travis?

28:50.170 --> 28:52.970
- Kitty,have you been practicing like I told you?
- Yes.

28:53.100 --> 28:57.220
What--what is the part
that comes after back left?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.210
- Side right.
- Side right.

29:00.580 --> 29:01.120
Well,you know what?

29:01.250 --> 29:03.820
Maybe you guys should just
have the first dance together.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.110
- What about benitez?
- Yeah.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.440
You know what?You know what?

29:08.560 --> 29:09.730
Let's just forget the whole thing.

29:09.850 --> 29:12.280
I mean,clearly,you're
busy,I'm busy,and¡ª

29:12.400 --> 29:13.750
and you're just not interested.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.110
And--and why
should you be?

29:15.240 --> 29:16.670
Kitty,come on,it's just a dance.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.310
No,it is not just a dance.

29:20.450 --> 29:24.420
It is a dance that you've had before
for a ceremony that you've had before.

29:24.550 --> 29:26.880
And I'm going to be
wearing a used dress.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.740
And you know what?I just thought it would
be nice for us to have a dance that was ours.

29:31.860 --> 29:32.980
But you know what?You're right.

29:33.110 --> 29:36.870
It's just too much to ask to
have a first at my own wedding.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.880
Shut up,travis!

29:40.150 --> 29:41.970
So should we clean this
up,or should we just,like,

29:42.090 --> 29:44.220
sort of let it sit and blend
in with the rest of your place?

29:44.340 --> 29:45.120
Whoa,hey.

29:45.230 --> 29:46.640
So now you're making
fun of my apartment?

29:46.750 --> 29:47.380
No.Are you kidding me?

29:47.490 --> 29:49.120
I'm having mess envy,for god sakes.

29:49.230 --> 29:52.940
I mean,rebellion in my house
is,like,leaving a crumb on the table.

29:53.650 --> 29:56.050
no wonder you turned to drugs.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.470
so what are your other
vices,besides being kind of a slob?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.590
Uh...well,coffee.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.200
Definitely.

30:04.340 --> 30:07.040
- Wine,clothes shopping.
- I see that.

30:07.170 --> 30:09.330
Yes

30:10.490 --> 30:11.900
- Hang on.
- Sure.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.600
- hey.
- Look,justin's in recovery.

30:15.740 --> 30:19.110
I know.Listen,can I call you back?

30:19.750 --> 30:22.240
Uh,why?Is justin there?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.030
- Oh,my god.
- Yeah.

30:24.160 --> 30:27.040
- Um,why don't I just talk to you tomorrow?
- Okay.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.690
what was all that about,if
you don't mind my asking?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.460
Lena.

30:36.590 --> 30:39.030
I thought you were talking about justin.

30:39.150 --> 30:41.760
No,she asked him out,mom.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.540
She did?

30:43.670 --> 30:45.230
Yeah,and--and--and it's
really not that I care.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.410
It's just,he's not supposed
to be dating anyone right now.

30:48.850 --> 30:50.510
Ugh,wait till kitty and sarah find out.

30:50.650 --> 30:52.240
It--it's not like they don't
judge me enough already.

30:52.370 --> 30:53.950
I really don't need
them blaming me for this.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.430
Sweetie,this is hardly your fault.

30:56.550 --> 30:57.500
Tell that to them.

30:57.630 --> 30:59.290
I mean,kitty is so intimidating.

30:59.410 --> 31:02.570
Sarah is-- I'm constantly paranoid
that she's making these digs at me.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.080
I keep humiliating myself.

31:04.210 --> 31:07.670
Rebecca,stop second-guessing yourself.

31:07.810 --> 31:08.790
It's not that easy,mom.

31:08.930 --> 31:12.190
I know that it's not that easy.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.860
But this shrinking violet
that you're becoming...

31:16.370 --> 31:18.270
that's not my daughter.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.590
I mean,you--you never used to
care what people thought about you.

31:21.660 --> 31:25.140
You didn't worry about what
you said or what you didn't say.

31:25.260 --> 31:31.570
I admire that about you,even
when you do that with me.

31:33.110 --> 31:36.510
Do that with them.

31:38.760 --> 31:42.150
So wait,no,you're telling me you
haven't seen,uh,"blades of glory"?

31:42.280 --> 31:44.050
- Nah,not yet.
- Oh,my word.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.390
You have to see this.I have the dvd.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.440
We can watch it tonight.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.770
You know what?I-I sh--I
should probably get outta here.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.340
Okay.

31:57.470 --> 31:59.690
I hope I didn't scare
you off or anything.

31:59.820 --> 32:02.520
No.Are you--I'm having
a great,great time.

32:02.640 --> 32:06.260
I just--I'm worried if I stay too long
that my--my sponsor will get pissed off.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.270
And he's kind of a big
dude,lot of tatts,so...

32:08.400 --> 32:12.380
no,listen,I totally get that you
should put your recovery first.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.540
Okay,thanks.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.700
You know,we'll wait for the right time.

32:15.830 --> 32:17.450
- All right,cool.
- Cool.

32:17.570 --> 32:19.280
Cool.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.300
screw it.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.690
Com mm,try the lemon scallops.Amazing.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.010
Mm,I prefer the orange chicken.

32:36.140 --> 32:39.360
Oh,man,this-- this
duck sauce is amazing.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.190
Can--I can really taste
the peaches and the plums.

32:42.310 --> 32:45.370
- You know,it's so...
- oh,I get it.

32:45.500 --> 32:49.970
Everything that we've been eating features
produce that we grow at ojai.Very good.

32:50.060 --> 32:51.800
Oh,and here I was,I thought
I was being very subtle.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.090
I'm just very smart.

32:53.210 --> 32:54.710
Well,then you'll hear what I'm saying.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.750
A billion people eat
this food every day.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.100
Don't you think it would taste a
lot better coming from your orchards?

32:59.230 --> 33:00.770
Of course.

33:00.890 --> 33:03.440
But you're not gonna
charm me into a deal.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.920
Not that you're not charming.It's
just,there's something about you.

33:07.440 --> 33:13.280
I don't know if it's the italian suit or the
fast-talk of easy money and international markets.

33:13.410 --> 33:16.160
- Maybe it's the perfect pedigree.
- Prect pedigree?

33:16.260 --> 33:18.750
it's just all too smooth to be true.

33:18.880 --> 33:19.810
I'm suspicious.

33:19.930 --> 33:22.800
First of all,I wasn't
born into this suit,okay?

33:22.910 --> 33:26.550
And when I walked into ojai,I was not
convinced that I would close the deal.

33:26.690 --> 33:30.620
I just thought that if you heard what I had
to say,you'd see it was a sound decision,

33:30.750 --> 33:33.940
something that's good for ojai
and for your family,that's it.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.900
Look... honestly,it's enticing.

33:40.050 --> 33:43.730
But ojai can't afford
that kind of risk exposure,

33:43.870 --> 33:47.840
and I can't jeopardize a
company that my father built,

33:47.990 --> 33:50.350
no matter the growth potential.

33:51.050 --> 33:54.920
So what if I told you I have a guy that
could get ojai in the market access program?

33:56.080 --> 33:57.350
Government subsidies?

33:57.470 --> 34:00.580
I'd tailor your company's profile so
it's exactly what they're looking for.

34:00.690 --> 34:03.070
The U.S.D.A. Wants to increase
its agricultural exports.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.150
Why not let 'em help pay for it?

34:05.270 --> 34:07.010
Who knows?We structure this deal right,

34:07.510 --> 34:12.030
there might even be enough left over for
me to take you on a private tour of beijing.

34:15.050 --> 34:16.219
okay.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.510
Get me more information on the program.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.100
I'll need to see the forecasts.

34:21.230 --> 34:25.760
If the numbers excite me,we'll talk.

34:28.210 --> 34:29.130
hello?

34:29.250 --> 34:30.500
Hello--jason?!

34:30.630 --> 34:31.800
Oh,my god!

34:31.940 --> 34:34.650
Oh,my god,I've missed you.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.960
No,no,I'm sorry.No,it's just your voice.

34:39.320 --> 34:42.520
You--well,why
haven't you call me?

34:42.639 --> 34:45.679
No,god.No,of course I
know the service is spotty.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.520
No,I'm good.I'm good.

34:47.650 --> 34:53.500
I just... I--yeah,well,I need--
I need-- I need to talk to you,too.

35:00.030 --> 35:01.940
- Cleaning or packing?
- Packing.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.420
A friend offered me her couch.I
think it'll be easier this way.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.040
Yeah,you're right.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.190
It would be easier.

35:10.310 --> 35:12.670
But difficult is
sometimes good,you know?

35:12.800 --> 35:15.000
It forces you to do things
you didn't think you could.

35:15.130 --> 35:16.810
Oh... we can do it,kevin.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.830
We always seem to end up...

35:18.950 --> 35:20.470
doing it.

35:20.850 --> 35:23.720
What we never seem to understand
is that it gets us nowhere.

35:25.180 --> 35:27.400
I finally spoke with jason.

35:28.530 --> 35:31.790
Good.I'm glad.I... I broke up with him.

35:34.660 --> 35:37.700
kevin,why do you always have
to be such a drama queen?

35:37.830 --> 35:40.510
So he didn't call you
for a couple of weeks.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.580
It's not that.

35:42.710 --> 35:45.490
- Scotty,when I first met you,I
thought we-- - kevin,kevin...

35:45.960 --> 35:47.640
if you're about to
romanticize what we had,just...

35:47.750 --> 35:49.950
I'm not.That's the whole point.

35:50.180 --> 35:53.200
Because what we had
was-- it--it was messy.

35:53.320 --> 35:57.720
You know,we were hot and cold and
back and forth,all over the place.

35:58.530 --> 36:00.830
But I wanna be back there with you

36:01.060 --> 36:03.670
because I wanna be
honest about who I am.

36:05.850 --> 36:09.020
- Did you tell jason we slept together?
- Yes,I did.

36:10.100 --> 36:15.290
Look,I know I'm--I'm
asking way too much of you.

36:15.400 --> 36:19.940
But like I said,easy isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

36:23.540 --> 36:24.850
it's gone.

36:25.910 --> 36:28.120
Yep.Yep.It's gone. It's gone.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.560
The... "the one" is gone.

36:30.700 --> 36:34.180
Well,at least mom won't be heartbroken.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.120
- Well,that's true.
- You know,I think it's a shame.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.780
I think u should wear whatever
you want on your wedding day.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.740
Oh,okay,rebecca.Well,thank
you very much.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.580
But you know what?It'll be fine.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.030
Hey,it's just my opinion.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.250
yeah,well,my opinion
is we need to commit.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.780
These dresses are fine.

36:47.910 --> 36:49.530
What about julia?Does
she look good in blue?

36:49.660 --> 36:52.260
- Julia looks good in anything.
- Bitch.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.950
All right,rebecca,let's start with you.

36:54.070 --> 36:55.840
So--so what
do you think?

36:55.960 --> 36:58.680
Honestly,I-I don't know what
sisters say in these situations.

36:58.810 --> 37:01.770
But the only way that I am ever gonna
be able to be myself around you two

37:01.890 --> 37:03.470
is if I stop filtering everything.

37:03.610 --> 37:05.560
So to answer your
question,kitty-- no.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.070
No,I-I-I don't like this color on
me and I-I don't like it on sarah.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.670
If you really wanna know the
dress that I would pick,it would...

37:12.100 --> 37:14.200
oh,my god.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.910
Well,r-rebecca,don't stop now.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.030
No,you're on a roll.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.440
Kitty,the one!

37:21.570 --> 37:23.700
- it's on sale.
- Oh,my gosh!

37:24.880 --> 37:28.690
Oh,my god,rebecca.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.890
Rebecca,do you really think
I should wear what I want?

37:31.020 --> 37:32.350
I do.

37:32.470 --> 37:34.830
Do you wanna wear this dress?

37:36.130 --> 37:37.860
I do.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.620
I swear I didn't go out looking for it.

37:42.750 --> 37:43.770
It--it was
just there.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.990
- And--and then it went on sale and
I just--it was-- - it was on sale?

37:47.470 --> 37:51.300
I was--I was just feeling like my
whole wedding was being recycled.

37:51.420 --> 37:52.820
And I-I just needed my something new.

37:52.940 --> 37:55.140
And--but please,mom,please
don't be angry.

37:55.250 --> 37:57.600
Honey,I'm not angry.It's
fine.You don't have to wear my--

37:57.720 --> 38:01.800
- a good fine or is it passive-aggressive fine? -
Sweetheart,I offered my dress to you as an option.

38:01.910 --> 38:05.590
- I know,but when you found me in it the other day,you practically started weeping.
- Oh,I did not.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.150
- You were very emotional.
- Well,honey,you're getting married.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.280
- You were like,"ahh!"
- And I came in,and you had my dress on.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.890
- It brought back memories.
- Well,but still,yeah.

38:11.010 --> 38:12.720
- I know,but still.
- Listen to me.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.730
This is your wedding,your
memories to create.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.850
Make your own choices,your own history.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.960
You don't have to relive mine.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.340
I can't believe that
you're being this cool.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.240
I mean,it's not that I thought that
you would be uncool,but I just--I...

38:28.340 --> 38:29.820
well,thanks.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.010
It's beautiful.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.980
Thank you,mom.Thank you.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.930
It's beautiful,honey.It's beautiful.

38:35.050 --> 38:36.900
Thanks,moM.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.040
- Kitty?
- Yeah?

38:39.440 --> 38:42.730
- you know what I did?
- No.What did you do?

38:42.840 --> 38:45.400
I went out to dinner with stan harris.

38:45.530 --> 38:46.370
stan harris.

38:46.500 --> 38:49.230
Uh,my "pretty woman" stan harris.

38:49.940 --> 38:50.880
oh,my god.How was it?

38:51.020 --> 38:52.770
Yeah. It was fine.G-good.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.530
If it's all right with you,I,uh...

38:54.670 --> 38:56.140
I invited him to your
wedding.Is that all right?

38:56.250 --> 38:57.940
Uh,yeah.Of course.Are you kidding?

38:58.050 --> 38:59.390
It's great.Uh,sorry.

38:59.390 --> 39:00.790
uh,honey,honey,just hold on one second.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.090
Mom,wait,mom.

39:02.210 --> 39:06.310
- Yeah.
- we're gonna have to find you a very hot dress.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.500
I think I have an idea.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.780
You're going to dye this?

39:09.910 --> 39:11.140
Something bold.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.840
Midnight blue,maybe.

39:12.990 --> 39:14.930
But this dress is a classic.

39:15.070 --> 39:16.740
I know. I love it.

39:16.890 --> 39:19.320
It's my history,and
I'm going to keep it.

39:19.460 --> 39:23.150
Maybe it's time to hike
up the hemline a little.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.110
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.400
here we go.

39:30.830 --> 39:32.240
oh,hey.

39:32.380 --> 39:34.360
I didn't think you'd
still be here by now.

39:34.490 --> 39:36.090
I figured you would've
gone home to your family.

39:36.230 --> 39:38.630
Yeah,I was just catching
up on some paperwork.

39:39.330 --> 39:41.490
Uh,so you're--
you're going out?

39:42.130 --> 39:43.790
Yeah.
