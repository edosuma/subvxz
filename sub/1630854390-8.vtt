WEBVTT

00:04.254 --> 00:05.464
Hey, come on.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.299
What's the rush?

00:07.382 --> 00:08.926
I mean, you don't wanna get caught,
do you?

00:09.927 --> 00:12.471
-By who?
-Isela, for starters.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.807
All of her rules about staying
within the boundaries.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.570
Okay, what now?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.161
Not a problem.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.723
Good plan.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.937
Stop dicking me around, okay?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.522
I understand he's eluded you in the past,

01:03.605 --> 01:05.899
and you need me to catch him
red-handed in the middle of the act.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.401
I'm searching his house today,

01:07.985 --> 01:10.445
but you're not giving me clear information
on my immunity.

01:11.822 --> 01:12.823
Hey, listen to me.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.369
Full immunity is a big fucking ask,
Margot.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.706
Are you speaking
for the entire NSA or just yourself?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.499
Other people need to sign off on this.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.792
Well, are they?

01:23.876 --> 01:26.962
Are you gonna be straight with me,
or do I need to get someone else involved?

01:40.058 --> 01:41.768
Did you speak to Charlie about the gun?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.478
I will.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.980
Allie, this is serious.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.232
-I got it.
-He needs to know he's going back.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.318
-I have to go to work.
-What's going on?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.070
I just gotta go, all right? I'm late.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.033
Even if you get Sandpiper up and running,
is it what they want?

01:56.909 --> 02:00.287
No. Not in a million years.
It was never designed to do that.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.663
I'm stalling for time.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.415
What's happening?

02:03.498 --> 02:05.000
Guillermo is dangerous. All right?

02:05.501 --> 02:06.960
I tracked his smuggling routes.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.086
I found predictable activity
and an anomaly.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.047
Of what?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.216
Something he wants kept secret.
Off the grid.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.592
I need to find out what it is.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.385
-I have to go.
-I'm starving.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.346
-Hey, sweetie.
-Hey.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.264
You better be quick.
The kitchen closes soon.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.767
Wait, where's Dina? Where'd she go?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.311
Hunting for mushrooms with Adolfo.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.189
Wait, are you guys coming? Dad?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.857
No. I'm good.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.737
See you all later.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.886
You're the only one who likes my soup.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.016
Your food is good, guera.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.226
It's good.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.311
Gracias.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.237
I come in peace.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.413
You know, you could just turn it off.
Or get a burner.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.333
I need the video function.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.462
You have a kid?

06:18.545 --> 06:21.924
A son. Otto. He's six.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.301
He lives with his mother in Bristol.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.802
He's beautiful.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.222
Do you see him much?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.351
His mother wanted me
to be a constant presence, or not at all.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.312
And I tried staying put.
I even got a job at Amnesty.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.189
In fact,
I did everything she wanted me to do,

06:37.272 --> 06:38.732
-but it felt--
-Performative.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.025
Fashionable.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.069
Self-congratulatory.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.530
But you have a son.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.741
I mean, didn't that change things?
What if something happened to you?

06:48.659 --> 06:49.660
I made a choice.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.999
And now he has a stepdad,
and I'm relegated to video chats.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.547
You were able to quiet the militant voice
and raise your children.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.299
You're lucky.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.386
You know, I listened to the words
that you said to me yesterday.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.513
They really affected me.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.060
I've been thinking a lot of things lately,
even turning myself in.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.982
But yesterday,
you reminded me that I used to care.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.818
I wanna help you.

07:24.069 --> 07:28.031
That's a mighty quick U-turn
from "stay the hell away."

07:28.991 --> 07:32.035
And a very convincing "fuck off."

07:33.871 --> 07:37.040
Well, you could have tucked yourself into
a lot of other nearby staging areas

07:37.124 --> 07:38.917
as well, but here you are.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.087
This is not one of those operations

07:42.171 --> 07:44.548
for the idealistic academics
we once were, Margot.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.635
I'm not gonna ruin your life. Not again.

07:49.595 --> 07:52.222
Well, I reached the end of that road.
So there's that.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.352
Do you remember the first time you came
over to my house?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.855
You were so shy. Intimidated.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.650
But I knew, we both knew,
there was something there.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.110
There still is.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.195
Yeah.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.282
But I'm sorry, I can't help you this time.

08:10.782 --> 08:15.621
See it like I'm protecting you.

08:53.825 --> 08:54.952
You have a car?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.163
Well, not exactly.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.875
But it's got wheels and an engine.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.004
And it runs.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.760
Sorry.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.687
It's Ridley's. I use it for work,

09:21.770 --> 09:23.730
-but sometimes he lets me borrow it.
-Nice.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.815
Watch out.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.414
So, tell me, where are we going?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.916
No. You'll find out.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.086
-Just wait.
-Oh, my God.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.989
That's where I play football.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.494
I'd say I'm pretty good.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.915
Never got to do stuff like that.
Just be a kid. You know?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.086
Yeah, I know.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.671
Sucks.

11:11.755 --> 11:15.384
Okay, what if you could trade lives
with someone?

11:16.844 --> 11:17.845
Who would you be?

11:17.928 --> 11:23.934
Sixteen-year-old girl who lives
in a nice neighborhood with both parents,

11:24.935 --> 11:30.816
who have normal fucking jobs.
And they have a dog.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.026
So no one specific?

11:34.987 --> 11:35.988
Nope.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.782
Just a normal girl.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.075
I don't buy it.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.413
Fine. The fucking queen of England.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.670
Okay, so that's our church.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.714
Whole town's there on Sunday.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.341
I prayed for us.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.304
What?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.348
I don't know. It's just weird to me.

12:03.432 --> 12:06.476
I'm not really religious. I'm…

12:08.395 --> 12:09.396
the opposite, actually.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.231
So you don't believe?

12:12.608 --> 12:15.652
Doesn't it get… lonely?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.416
What's going on?

12:31.168 --> 12:33.378
Stop asking questions.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.309
Everyone looks so happy.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.051
You dance?

14:48.138 --> 14:50.224
-No. I don't know how.
-It's banda. It doesn't matter.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.642
I'll teach you. Come on.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.895
-No.
-Get up. Come on.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
-No.
-Let's go.

14:57.648 --> 14:58.732
Oh, my God.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.528
Come on. Let's go.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.949
It's all right, I promise.
All right, come on.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.953
Jesus Christ.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.205
-Dad, it's me.
-Charlie, what are you doing here?

15:55.873 --> 15:56.999
I followed you.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.459
And why the hell did you do that?

16:01.378 --> 16:04.214
Well, I heard you tell Mom you were
in danger and wanted to help.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.382
You shouldn't have come.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.926
Did you see those men back there?

16:08.010 --> 16:11.889
Guillermo's guys run a looting sideline.
This place is so rotten.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.350
Yeah, I've seen them before, though.

16:15.434 --> 16:18.395
Wait, sorry.
You've come this far on your own before?

16:21.315 --> 16:22.566
Charlie.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.026
Yeah, a few times.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.738
Dad, it's okay, though.
I know how to be careful, all right?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.866
I know about those guys.
They're huaqueros.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.285
They're looters.
They look for artifacts and stuff.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.413
Look, I can help you. Let me help.

16:39.041 --> 16:43.003
The guy who owns Casa Roja,
he wants me to use Sandpiper to help him.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.465
I'll explain later.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.095
Hey.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.388
If you're coming, let's go.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.228
And then one more and turn.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.312
Okay.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.107
Great.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.192
-And then--
-Again?

18:27.232 --> 18:31.278
Allie wasn't at the jetty.
And he's not at Casa Roja.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.488
I waited, and I waited.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.282
He stood me up.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.336
So, you gonna tell me about Sandpiper?

18:48.337 --> 18:50.088
It's an algorithm. It's a program.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.175
It finds order
in what most people think is chaos.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.344
Like what?

18:56.512 --> 18:57.804
Anything.

18:57.888 --> 19:00.724
People, the weather, wind, animals.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.186
Rooster crows every morning, right?
That's a pattern.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.687
Here, look.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.359
Even this.

19:12.277 --> 19:15.322
Order and chaos,
all in the palm of your hand.

19:17.908 --> 19:18.992
I don't get it.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.289
All right. One leaf, that's order. Right?

19:25.457 --> 19:27.584
Tree, it gets a little more complicated.

19:27.668 --> 19:32.714
But all this, that's chaos, right?

19:33.507 --> 19:34.800
Okay.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.261
Except it's not. It's a pattern.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.722
You just have to unlock what it is.
Why it's arranged the way it is.

19:40.806 --> 19:43.600
And for that, you need data, lots of it.

19:43.684 --> 19:46.019
So, why is this even important?

19:46.603 --> 19:49.690
You understand the pattern,
then you can control it.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.694
Like, predict the future?

19:53.777 --> 19:56.655
Yeah, kinda.
I mean, it's not perfect, but it can.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.783
Yeah, but some things just happen, right?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.827
Randomly. Like an accident.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.787
Yeah, politicians.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.373
Dad, I'm serious. Come on.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.210
Like, there are some things
that you can't predict.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.921
That don't have a pattern. Right?

20:13.005 --> 20:14.173
Right.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.925
Look, you see that bird?

20:17.509 --> 20:20.304
Now, if it were possible to
give me every piece of data on that bird,

20:20.387 --> 20:24.099
mating patterns, life span, weather,
absolutely everything,

20:24.183 --> 20:27.477
then I could tell you exactly where
that bird's gonna fly next.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.813
Even how it might die,
or what's gonna kill it.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.276
That's kinda depressing.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.777
Uh-huh.

20:35.861 --> 20:38.238
But I might also be able
to tell you how to save it.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.074
I don't know.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.577
I mean, didn't you tell me that, like--

20:43.660 --> 20:46.622
that if someone has an answer
that they can apply to everything,

20:46.705 --> 20:50.250
then it isn't a real answer.
It's like a cult. Right?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.419
And what do you believe?

20:54.713 --> 20:59.051
I believe that the bird
just flies wherever the fuck it wants to.

21:00.219 --> 21:03.263
Well, you've always been a little chaotic.

21:03.889 --> 21:05.807
That's your pattern. Like your mom.

21:13.232 --> 21:14.233
Gracias.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.527
Gracias.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.035
-Here. I'll go get us something to drink.
-Okay.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.545
Where are we?

21:35.504 --> 21:36.505
El zocalo.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.883
Yeah. But, what town?

21:39.967 --> 21:41.218
San Pasqual…

21:45.514 --> 21:47.182
Is there an airport nearby?

22:21.091 --> 22:24.761
-Who are these guys?
-I don't fucking know. Guillermo's men.

22:25.971 --> 22:26.972
Where's your team?

22:27.639 --> 22:30.142
He turned them away.
He insists I use his people.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.895
His people are traffickers.

22:32.978 --> 22:35.147
They're voracious,
and they know no bounds.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.774
You'll keep their visit short.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.068
What's wrong with that guy?

22:40.903 --> 22:42.404
He's so fucking weird.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.198
He wasn't always like this.

22:46.867 --> 22:49.119
He had a car accident driving drunk.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.331
His mom was with him, and she died.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.791
Family has never forgiven him.

23:28.158 --> 23:30.827
So, is Margot part of your plan,

23:30.911 --> 23:32.913
-or any of your plans?
-No.

23:34.248 --> 23:35.791
What's been going on with her and Allie?

23:37.376 --> 23:40.337
Well, I can tell you that he sank a boat
to keep her from running away.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.421
Really?

23:41.505 --> 23:43.507
That should tell you how she feels
about Allie.

23:44.716 --> 23:49.096
That, however, doesn't answer
her sincerity or motives toward you.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.848
-See you later.
-Yeah.

25:15.599 --> 25:16.433
Okay.

25:49.383 --> 25:50.801
Jesus Christ.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.511
Hi.

26:11.363 --> 26:12.364
Oh.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.619
Take a look at this.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.292
Damn, this must have been amazing.

26:24.293 --> 26:26.295
Exactly. Must've. Once.

26:27.171 --> 26:30.132
Before some asshole sawed off all
the glyphs and hauled them out of here.

26:30.632 --> 26:31.758
How would you even do that?

26:31.842 --> 26:34.845
I mean, it would've been nice
to just leave it here.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.597
Let someone come actually see it for real.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.100
What good are they gonna do here,
losing money in the jungle?

26:40.184 --> 26:43.687
Put 'em in a museum.
You know, charge 20 bucks for a T-shirt.

26:45.522 --> 26:46.523
-Right.
-You hack 'em up.

26:46.607 --> 26:48.775
Send 'em to a whole bunch of museums.
Quadruple your money.

26:48.859 --> 26:49.860
Right.

26:50.527 --> 26:55.199
'Cause car parts are worth more
than an actually good car, right?

26:55.282 --> 26:57.159
Turns out you do listen to things I say.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.912
People won't respect anything
they can't monetize.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.539
They have to steal it and then sell it.

27:04.249 --> 27:05.250
Bingo.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.837
Even worse,
when people get their history stolen,

27:09.755 --> 27:13.675
their soul goes right along with it,
Colonialism 101.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.639
Kind of like with us.

27:19.932 --> 27:22.351
-What does that mean?
-No, no, not, like--

27:22.434 --> 27:25.979
Not, like, in a bad way. I just mean,
like, we don't really have a history.

27:26.063 --> 27:27.856
Or not one that we talk about, at least.

27:29.525 --> 27:31.235
But that's probably a good thing, right?
I mean…

27:32.778 --> 27:34.446
It just means, like, we're free, right?

27:34.530 --> 27:36.532
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.659
No one can tell us otherwise, right?

27:42.246 --> 27:43.247
Sit down for a second.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.719
Have a seat.

28:00.389 --> 28:02.015
I found some wine and opened it.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.310
I found your bag and opened it too.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.531
Do I really seem like a "Judi" to you?

28:23.078 --> 28:24.288
Were you gonna kidnap me?

28:24.788 --> 28:25.789
First off…

28:28.208 --> 28:32.921
screw you for invading my space
and rummaging through my things.

28:33.005 --> 28:36.383
We're way, way past that, Richard.

28:36.466 --> 28:40.137
I've spent the last ten years
looking at four walls around me.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.472
When the self-pity starts,

28:43.223 --> 28:47.102
I remind myself they aren't
four walls of an actual prison cell.

28:47.603 --> 28:50.272
And that's why
I don't want you involved with this one.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.816
Let me finish, please.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.863
I have no choices available to me

28:57.946 --> 29:02.075
and no position or situation better
than the one that I am in right now.

29:02.159 --> 29:03.368
And then you show up.

29:07.873 --> 29:10.375
You come here wanting me
to go away with you?

29:13.295 --> 29:15.214
I didn't know how you'd react.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.383
Turns out, not so good.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.346
I want a partner, Richard.

29:23.472 --> 29:26.141
I've been missing that
ever since you drove away and abandoned me

29:26.225 --> 29:28.227
-all those fucking years ago.
-Look, here's the thing.

29:29.811 --> 29:33.357
You've asked a couple of times,
gently but persistently.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.900
Don't ask.

29:36.193 --> 29:37.528
Don't pry.

29:38.946 --> 29:44.826
I do not want you involved with this one.
Do you understand?

29:45.786 --> 29:47.079
I don't want you to get hurt.

29:47.162 --> 29:50.916
This is my first mission, not on my own,
being paid by someone else,

29:50.999 --> 29:53.377
and it's turning out
to be quite complicated.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.170
Guillermo.

29:56.213 --> 29:57.339
It's too dangerous.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.218
I'm doing this on my own.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.601
Here's a passport.

30:12.062 --> 30:13.188
Come and meet me.

30:19.862 --> 30:21.488
I don't know who I am anymore.

30:23.407 --> 30:24.533
I'm lost.

30:27.244 --> 30:30.163
So, either I'm all in, as a partner,
or I'm out.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.295
I'm tired of paying
for a mistake I made years ago

30:36.378 --> 30:37.880
and how I've spent my life since.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.882
The judgment. The condescension.

30:41.550 --> 30:42.759
So, this is it.

30:44.678 --> 30:47.681
Either you trust me, or you don't.
You include me, or I'm out.

30:51.977 --> 30:54.062
Don't forget
I protected you all those years.

31:13.749 --> 31:16.835
I found these detonators
with the passports.

31:30.307 --> 31:31.433
Partners?

31:54.456 --> 31:56.208
I'll take you to the target
in the morning.

32:00.712 --> 32:01.713
Okay.

32:04.591 --> 32:05.926
So, you think that's what we do?

32:07.469 --> 32:08.887
We just do whatever the fuck we want?

32:08.971 --> 32:11.682
No, I…

32:16.103 --> 32:18.480
I mean, kinda. Yeah.

32:19.857 --> 32:21.775
No. We don't.

32:22.985 --> 32:24.319
We do whatever is right.

32:25.070 --> 32:28.323
And sometimes, what's right in the moment
isn't even what we want.

32:28.407 --> 32:29.741
But we have to do it anyway.

32:36.164 --> 32:37.833
Is that why you pulled the gun
on that guy?

32:39.459 --> 32:41.461
'Cause you just think
we can do whatever the fuck we want?

32:41.545 --> 32:43.547
No. I did that because I don't like him.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.048
And why is that?

32:45.549 --> 32:47.092
Because he's fucking with us.

32:48.510 --> 32:51.763
Hey, I'm not a fan either.
But I'm never gonna hurt the guy.

32:51.847 --> 32:53.891
-I didn't hurt him. I wasn't--
-Ever.

32:53.974 --> 32:56.310
Ever. Do you understand?

32:58.687 --> 32:59.688
Yeah.

33:04.276 --> 33:05.277
And why?

33:06.945 --> 33:08.071
Why wouldn't I hurt him?

33:11.283 --> 33:12.284
I don't know.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.495
I mean, he fucked up our lives.

33:15.579 --> 33:18.540
So, if you ask me,
I think you have every right.

33:19.124 --> 33:20.125
Wrong.

33:21.627 --> 33:24.796
I wouldn't hurt him
because that would fuck up my life,

33:25.839 --> 33:27.007
my plan.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.842
My plan for you, my plan for Dina.

33:30.219 --> 33:31.470
So, why did you do it?

33:35.557 --> 33:37.226
Just sometimes I…

33:39.228 --> 33:42.022
I just get so angry and so scared.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.106
Like--

33:44.858 --> 33:48.529
Like, I feel like
every part of me is screaming, and…

33:50.364 --> 33:51.698
I can't stop.

33:54.576 --> 33:57.246
So, is that about him,
or is that about you?

33:58.956 --> 34:01.792
I killed that guy.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.756
And you never said anything.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.801
Not once. None of this.

34:13.637 --> 34:14.638
Why?

34:17.266 --> 34:18.350
Because…

34:20.060 --> 34:21.895
Because you did that for us.

34:22.813 --> 34:24.063
You had to.

34:25.774 --> 34:26.775
Right?

34:28.360 --> 34:29.570
So, I did the right thing?

34:31.487 --> 34:34.574
That wasn't Colonialism 101?

34:38.161 --> 34:39.663
It's like I said.

34:41.581 --> 34:45.293
Sometimes, what's right in the moment
isn't what we want.

34:46.295 --> 34:47.920
But we have to do it anyway.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.261
-Okay.
-Come on.

34:55.512 --> 34:56.638
Let's walk.

35:13.113 --> 35:17.826
Has anyone, I don't know,
taken you on a date like this ever before?

35:18.827 --> 35:19.995
Hardly.

35:20.954 --> 35:22.831
There was this guy back home named Josh.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.501
I used to think
it was such a big deal but…

35:27.419 --> 35:28.921
I look at it now, and it was nothing.

35:31.965 --> 35:33.258
Nothing happened.

35:36.929 --> 35:38.013
What's wrong?

35:39.890 --> 35:40.891
Nothing.

35:42.267 --> 35:43.519
-I'm fine.
-Um…

35:44.603 --> 35:46.146
Would you like to go to my place?

35:47.564 --> 35:48.607
Yeah.

35:49.399 --> 35:50.400
Okay.

36:12.714 --> 36:14.967
I know where it is.
I just don't know what it is.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.219
It's in the general area, at least.

36:18.136 --> 36:20.889
Couldn't it be, like,
underground or something?

36:21.723 --> 36:25.018
Yeah but why bother when the jungle
lets you hide in plain sight?

36:38.198 --> 36:40.993
Is that what they're hiding? Cows?

36:41.076 --> 36:42.619
I don't know. Stay low.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.045
Dad.

37:26.455 --> 37:27.956
Looks like some kind of hand off.

37:51.396 --> 37:52.397
What do you think?

37:54.566 --> 37:56.109
That we've come to the right place.

38:13.669 --> 38:15.087
Wait here. You got it?

38:15.587 --> 38:16.797
Why? There's nobody here.

38:17.965 --> 38:19.883
Because I said so, okay?

38:19.967 --> 38:22.261
Dad, if it's not safe for me,
then it's not safe for you.

38:22.344 --> 38:26.056
Charlie, I mean it. Stay right here.

38:59.089 --> 39:00.340
I thought I told you to stay.

39:06.388 --> 39:07.389
Hold that.

39:11.602 --> 39:13.020
Okay.

39:14.479 --> 39:16.106
It just looks like farm stuff.

39:16.690 --> 39:17.691
Nope.

39:18.859 --> 39:19.860
It's not farm stuff.

39:20.986 --> 39:22.404
Hurry. They might be back soon.

40:18.544 --> 40:20.838
Dad, come here.

40:31.390 --> 40:32.558
We should go, right?

40:32.641 --> 40:35.352
I mean, if they're hiding this here,
we're probably on camera or something.

40:35.435 --> 40:36.436
No.

40:37.479 --> 40:39.064
It's the last place they want cameras.

40:40.107 --> 40:41.233
Too much evidence.

40:41.733 --> 40:42.734
Move your hands.

40:48.198 --> 40:49.533
Here, help me out.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.081
Yeah.

40:59.835 --> 41:01.295
He's skimming off the top.

41:01.378 --> 41:02.880
He's cutting it with caffeine.

41:02.963 --> 41:05.966
He's stealing drugs from the cartels
in transit and reselling it.

41:08.552 --> 41:11.054
No cameras, no evidence.

41:11.138 --> 41:14.933
Our landlord is not quite as invulnerable
as he'd like to think.

41:15.017 --> 41:17.644
I'd say we're in a position
to make an ask or two.

41:20.898 --> 41:21.899
Gotcha.

41:42.836 --> 41:43.921
It's not much.

41:44.505 --> 41:45.881
It's all I can afford right now.

41:46.381 --> 41:49.009
You know, fuck that.
Neither of us had many choices.

41:50.135 --> 41:51.178
I'm working on it.

42:31.426 --> 42:33.679
Would you like some water, or some--

42:33.762 --> 42:35.389
-I have a kitchen, so…
-Okay.

42:36.056 --> 42:37.891
Okay, I'll be right back.

43:43.457 --> 43:44.625
Christ.

43:56.011 --> 43:57.095
Okay.

44:00.015 --> 44:00.974
Dina!

44:02.935 --> 44:04.728
Dina, hey, stop!

44:07.022 --> 44:08.899
You're gonna have to take me out
if you want to leave.

44:15.989 --> 44:17.115
What the hell?

44:17.699 --> 44:19.409
So that's what this has all been about?

44:20.452 --> 44:24.289
-No, I had no choice, okay?
-What?

44:24.831 --> 44:26.542
I'm leaving. This was my only chance.

44:27.251 --> 44:30.629
Did you even think what would happen
to me if you stole my boss's truck?

44:32.214 --> 44:33.465
Did you?

44:33.549 --> 44:34.591
-No!
-Jesus Christ, Dina!

44:34.675 --> 44:36.468
Jes-- I'd go to jail.

44:36.552 --> 44:40.430
I'll spend the rest of my fucking life
working to replace it.

44:43.308 --> 44:45.936
I'm sorry, okay?

44:47.062 --> 44:48.188
It's not what you think.

44:48.272 --> 44:50.649
I'm not some fricking normal person, okay?

44:50.732 --> 44:54.278
I mean, am I honestly just supposed
to think you were gonna help me?

44:56.238 --> 44:57.239
Will you?

45:19.011 --> 45:20.429
Where were you going?

45:27.186 --> 45:28.187
Where's Mom?

45:28.854 --> 45:29.855
I don't know.

45:30.731 --> 45:31.773
Hungry?

45:31.857 --> 45:32.900
Yeah, actually.

45:34.318 --> 45:37.821
We could go to the mess hall. Get--
Do you want soup or something?

45:38.322 --> 45:39.948
Yeah, soup sounds good.

45:40.616 --> 45:42.868
Okay. Today was fun.

45:42.951 --> 45:44.036
Yeah.

45:47.164 --> 45:48.165
Hey.

45:49.041 --> 45:51.210
-Where have you been?
-Been with me.

45:52.085 --> 45:53.962
Oh, yeah? Guillermo's?

45:54.046 --> 45:56.006
No, I'll fill you in later.

45:58.509 --> 45:59.718
Where are you going?

46:00.219 --> 46:02.971
I was gonna go check if Dina's back
and then go to the mess hall.

46:03.055 --> 46:05.807
Okay, well, be careful.
Silvia's got an eye out for you.

46:10.437 --> 46:11.688
Did you talk to him?

46:11.772 --> 46:13.482
Yeah. Talked a lot.

46:14.483 --> 46:17.277
Good. Is he happy to go back?

46:17.361 --> 46:18.695
We didn't get to that.

46:18.779 --> 46:19.780
What?

46:20.781 --> 46:23.951
Fuck, Allie, we have one window.
They need to be ready to go.

46:24.034 --> 46:26.495
I'm this close to Richard. I can feel it.

46:31.708 --> 46:34.211
Dear Mom, Dad, and Charlie.

46:35.170 --> 46:36.630
From the time I was little,

46:37.130 --> 46:40.717
we'd pick up and move suddenly
without explanation.

46:41.969 --> 46:44.888
I didn't complain
because I was just a kid.

46:44.972 --> 46:47.099
And where would I have gone instead?

46:48.684 --> 46:50.477
Well, now I'm leaving.

46:51.979 --> 46:53.939
I don't trust either of you anymore.

46:54.439 --> 46:56.567
You never really cared
if I was happy or not.

46:58.318 --> 46:59.945
Frankly, I don't know what to write

47:00.028 --> 47:02.030
that I haven't said
a hundred times before.

47:03.407 --> 47:04.825
I do love you.

47:05.576 --> 47:09.538
Don't worry. The one thing you taught me,
Dad, is how to take care of myself.

47:10.747 --> 47:13.375
Charlie, I love you so much.

47:14.835 --> 47:16.044
I'm so sorry.
