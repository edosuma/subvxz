00:04.004 --> 00:05.136
(Meredith) HAVE YOU EVER HAD
THE STARRING ROLE IN A PLAY...

00:05.136 --> 00:06.637
(laughs)
A SOLO IN A RECITAL?

00:06.637 --> 00:08.179
OKAY, SHE'S GONNA TAKE HER FIRST
STEPS ANY MINUTE. I CAN FEEL IT.

00:08.179 --> 00:09.310
ALL EYES ON YOU...

00:09.310 --> 00:10.641
OKAY, SO I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
THE GIRAFFE,

00:10.641 --> 00:12.183
AND MAYBE SHE'LL WALK TO YOU.
(toy squeaks)

00:12.183 --> 00:13.544
WELL, SHE'S NOT GONNA
DO IT ON CUE.

00:13.544 --> 00:15.086
SHE'S GONNA SURPRISE US,
RIGHT?

00:15.086 --> 00:17.048
YOU GONNA SURPRISE US?
HERE YOU GO.

00:17.048 --> 00:18.519
WAITING FOR YOU TO DO...
THAT'S IT. COME TO DADDY.
YEAH, COME ON!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.020
WHAT THEY CAME TO SEE...
(laughs)

00:20.020 --> 00:22.123
OH! HI. YEAH, DADDY.
SHE'S GONNA
TAKE HER FIRST STEPS

00:22.123 --> 00:23.454
WHILE SHE'S IN DAY CARE,
AND THEN I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF.
NO, SHE WON'T.

00:23.454 --> 00:25.025
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT,
RIGHT, ZO? ZO, COME TO DADDY.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.627
COME TO DADDY.
(babbling)

00:26.627 --> 00:29.200
COME ON. COME GET THE GIRAFFE.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.501
YOU'RE JUST THE CUTEST KID
ON THE ENTIRE PLANET.

00:30.501 --> 00:32.032
WHY IS THAT?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.064
SHE'S PERFECT.

00:33.064 --> 00:34.335
(beep)
OKAY.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.367
FEELING THE INCREDIBLE PRESSURE
TO PERFORM.

00:36.367 --> 00:39.210
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THEY
USED TO CALL OPERATING ROOMS

00:39.210 --> 00:41.672
AN OPERATING THEATER.

00:41.672 --> 00:44.215
(switches click)

00:44.215 --> 00:46.817
IT STILL FEELS LIKE ONE.

00:46.817 --> 00:49.420
(spritzes)

00:49.420 --> 00:53.184
SCORES OF PEOPLE GET READY
FOR THE SHOW.

00:53.184 --> 00:56.587
THE SETS ARE ARRANGED.

00:56.587 --> 00:59.190
THERE ARE COSTUMES...

00:59.190 --> 01:01.432

music playing)

01:01.432 --> 01:04.665
MASKS...

01:04.665 --> 01:07.768
PROPS.

ALL LEADING TO THE MOMENT

01:15.376 --> 01:17.108
WHEN THE CURTAIN GOES UP.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.780
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT CARNEGIE HALL?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.612
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET THERE.

01:21.612 --> 01:23.614
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE

01:23.614 --> 01:25.116
UNTIL IT IS PERFECT,
PEOPLE.

01:25.116 --> 01:27.658
THIS IS A LONG,
COMPLEX PROCEDURE

01:27.658 --> 01:29.190
WITH MANY PARTS.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.562
THEREFORE MANY OPPORTUNITIES
FOR ERROR.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.294
SO WE'RE GONNA
GO OVER THIS AGAIN.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.525
TEAM LEADERS,
LET'S GET IN PLACE.

OVER HERE, PLEASE.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.168
(Arizona) LET'S GO, RED.

01:37.168 --> 01:39.500
WE'VE OFFERED THIS FAMILY
EVERY PRO BONO DOLLAR,

01:39.500 --> 01:42.703
EVERY SURGICAL HAND, EVERY
RESOURCE THIS HOSPITAL HAS.

01:42.703 --> 01:46.177
SO I'M ASKING YOU FOR
EVERY RESOURCE THAT YOU HAVE.

BE SHARP, BE PRESENT,
BE FOCUSED.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.343
DR. ROBBINS HAS BEEN
CARING FOR THESE CHILDREN

01:52.343 --> 01:53.814
SINCE THE DAY THEY WERE BORN.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.817
THEY WILL EACH GET
A NEW LIFE TODAY.

01:56.817 --> 02:01.392
OUR ACTIONS WILL DECIDE
WHAT KIND OF LIVES THEY WILL BE.

02:07.258 --> 02:08.759
LET'S BEGIN.

02:08.759 --> 02:12.233
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
people speaking indistinctly)

02:12.233 --> 02:14.205
I THOUGHT I HAD
DR. KNOX.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.866
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU?
YOUR WARMTH.

02:15.866 --> 02:18.439
YOU WERE DOING
THE CONJOINED TWINS.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.541
WELL, NOW KNOX IS DOING
THE CONJOINED TWINS.
UH-HUH.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.313
UH, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT IT.

02:22.313 --> 02:24.144
OH, OF COURSE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.177
IT IS A CRAZY IDEA

02:26.177 --> 02:28.779
THAT I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT

02:28.779 --> 02:30.781
BECAUSE IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S NOT CRAZY.

02:30.781 --> 02:32.323
WE'D SLEEP IN ONE BED,

02:32.323 --> 02:33.724
WE WOULD HAVE BREAKFAST
AT THE SAME TABLE,

02:33.724 --> 02:36.327
WE'D HAVE ONE ELECTRIC BILL
INSTEAD OF TWO.

02:36.327 --> 02:37.828
OH, THAT'S WHY YOU WANT ME
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU,

02:37.828 --> 02:39.390
SO WE COULD SAVE
ON THE ELECTRIC?

02:39.390 --> 02:40.731
YEAH, IT'S
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO...

02:40.731 --> 02:42.333
(scoffs)
FOR THE PLANET.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.495
I AM NOT MOVING IN
WITH YOU.

02:44.495 --> 02:47.268
IT W-WHAT, LOOK, WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER, WHAT, TWO WEEKS?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.169
TWO WEEKS AND NINE MONTHS,
BEFORE THE PAUSE.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.301
AND I WANT
TO HIT PLAY AGAIN,

02:50.301 --> 02:51.642
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

02:51.642 --> 02:53.644
I DON'T WANT TO START
AT THE BEGINNING.

02:53.644 --> 02:55.406
BECAUSE IT'S GOOD
FOR THE PLANET?

02:55.406 --> 02:56.477
AND I HAVE A BETTER TV.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.178

02:58.178 --> 03:00.381
LOOK, COME ON NOW. ADMIT IT.
YOU--YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH ME.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.883
YOU LOVE ME.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.255

03:04.255 --> 03:05.356

KNOX BACK.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.392
MM.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.893
FLAPS ARE INSET
AND VIABLE.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.725
WE ARE LOOKING AT
AT LEAST 18 HOURS,

03:14.725 --> 03:16.597
SO COME AND GO IF YOU NEED TO,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.229
HYDRATE, EAT,

03:18.229 --> 03:21.302
BUT BE HERE AT LEAST 30 MINUTES
BEFORE YOUR PROCEDURES.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.234
ALL RIGHT. NEXT UP,
GENERAL SURGERY.

03:23.234 --> 03:24.505
FIRST WE NEED TO ESTABLISH

03:24.505 --> 03:26.437
EACH BABY'S BLOOD SUPPLY
TO THE SHARED COLON.

03:26.437 --> 03:28.409
THEN WE SEPARATE THE COLON,
MAKING THE FIRST INCISION--

03:28.409 --> 03:31.682
I WILL MAKE THE FIRST INCISION.
WE'LL SEPARATE THE COLON.

03:31.682 --> 03:33.514
OKAY, AND NOW I'M CHECKING
THE DISPLACED KIDNEYS--

03:33.514 --> 03:35.246
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
INTACT AND FUNCTIONING.

03:35.246 --> 03:36.587
UH, THAT'S IMPLIED.

03:36.587 --> 03:38.218
I DON'T CARE. SAY IT.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.520
CHECKING THE KIDNEYS
TO MAKE SURE

03:39.520 --> 03:41.221
THEY'RE INTACT
AND FUNCTIONING.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.393
MAN,
SHE'S WOUND UP TIGHT.

03:42.393 --> 03:43.854
THOUGHT YOU WERE
OFF WORK TODAY.

03:43.854 --> 03:46.397
I WON'T SEE ANOTHER ONE
OF THESE IN MY LIFETIME.

03:46.397 --> 03:48.699
OKAY, YOU NEED TO TIE
THAT OFF BETTER, THOUGH.
YOU'RE DOING THE FLIP,
RIGHT, KAREV, WITH ROBBINS?

03:48.699 --> 03:50.230
MM-HMM.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.362
THE FLIP'S A CRITICAL PART.
YOU READY?

03:51.362 --> 03:53.334
YES, SIR.
YOU FORGOT TO CAUTERIZE.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.705
YOU WANT THIS BABY
TO BLEED OUT?
(man) DO I--

03:54.705 --> 03:56.337
NO, I--
YEAH, I SHOULD THINK NOT.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.638
LOOK, I KNOW THIS PROCEDURE
IS HER BABY,

03:57.638 --> 03:59.270
BUT SHE KEEPS
NITPICKING EVERYBODY,

03:59.270 --> 04:01.272
SHE'LL DESTROY
THEIR CONFIDENCE.

04:01.272 --> 04:04.244
DON'T LET HER DO THAT
TO YOU.
OH, NO, SIR.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
(speaks indistinctly)
GOOD, BECAUSE IF
THIS FLIP GOES WRONG,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.548
SHE'S GONNA BLAME YOU.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.780
IT'LL GO ON YOUR RECORD,
AND--AND BOARDS COMING UP--

04:09.780 --> 04:11.452
IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK GOOD.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.983
DID YOU CHECK THE PELVIS?
(man) I-I...

04:12.983 --> 04:14.355
GLAD IT'S NOT ME.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.387
OKAY, IT'S TIME TO FLIP THEM.

04:16.387 --> 04:18.529
KAREV, YOU'RE UP.

04:18.529 --> 04:22.262
(indistinct conversations)

04:26.537 --> 04:27.798
READY?

04:27.798 --> 04:29.470
(indistinct conversations
continue)

04:29.470 --> 04:31.342
YEAH.

04:31.342 --> 04:33.344
(woman) AND WHY IS THE FLIP
SO IMPORTANT?

04:33.344 --> 04:34.945
IT JUST GETS VERY TRICKY.

04:34.945 --> 04:38.349
THEY HAVE OPEN INCISIONS,
SO THEY HAVE TO STAY STERILE,

04:38.349 --> 04:39.710
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY STAY INTUBATED

04:39.710 --> 04:41.382
AND MONITORED.
OKAY.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.414
AND WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP
ALL THEIR I.V.s AND WIRES

04:43.414 --> 04:45.756
FROM GETTING TANGLED
AND INTERTWINED IN THE PROCESS.

04:45.756 --> 04:47.388
YOU KNOW, I--

04:47.388 --> 04:48.959
IMAGINE, UM,

04:48.959 --> 04:50.821
CHANGING THE BATTERY
OF YOUR CAR

04:50.821 --> 04:52.823
WHILE SPEEDING
DOWN THE FREEWAY.

04:54.024 --> 04:56.997
EXCEPT IT'S NOT A CAR
OR A BATTERY.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.599
I MEAN, THEY'RE YOUR BABIES.
(chuckles)

04:58.599 --> 05:01.372
SO... IT'S A BAD ANALOGY.
I'M SORRY.

05:01.372 --> 05:02.503
NO, THAT'S THE FIRST THING
YOU'VE SAID

05:02.503 --> 05:04.375
THAT I'VE
TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD.

05:04.375 --> 05:05.336
(elevator bell dings)

05:05.336 --> 05:07.338
BUT IF THE FLIP
GOES WRONG, THEN...

05:07.338 --> 05:09.480
EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS...

05:09.480 --> 05:11.482
IS HOSED.

05:11.482 --> 05:15.346
WELL, THE DOCTORS HAVE PLANNED
AND REHEARSED THIS FOR WEEKS.

05:15.346 --> 05:16.687
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT IT DOWN.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.489
KAREV, YOU RUSHED IT. YOU'RE
LIKE TWO STEPS AHEAD OF ME.

05:18.489 --> 05:19.820
NO, YOU OVER ME.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.991
YOURS OVER MINE,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

05:20.991 --> 05:22.923
MINE OVER YOURS,
BABIES IN THE MORGUE.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.395
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
THAT'S YOUR PNEUMONIC DEVICE?

05:24.395 --> 05:25.856
GREAT. NOW BRANDI'S WOUNDS
ARE EXPOSED,

05:25.856 --> 05:28.459
AND LITTLE ANDI'S GONE WITHOUT
OXYGEN FOR A WHOLE MINUTE.

05:28.459 --> 05:29.660
OKAY, I--
CAN WE START OVER?

05:29.660 --> 05:31.031
NO, THERE'S NO TIME.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.463
LET'S JUST FINISH
THIS PRACTICE

05:32.463 --> 05:34.505
AND TRY THE FLIP AGAIN.
NEXT.

05:34.505 --> 05:35.466
(Derek) NEURO.

05:35.466 --> 05:36.637
(Callie) ORTHO.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.808
OKAY, WE WILL ACCESS
AND SEPARATE

05:37.808 --> 05:39.370
THE CONJOINED SPINAL CANAL.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.372
SEPARATE THE BONY ELEMENTS
OF THE SPINE.

05:41.372 --> 05:42.342
(Meredith) WELL,
THAT WAS A TRAIN WRECK.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.514
YOU NEARLY KILLED BOTH DOLLS.

05:43.514 --> 05:44.775
LOOK, I HAVE IT.
I KNOW IT.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.477
IF ONLY FREAKIN' ROBBINS
WOULD TRUST ME TO DO IT.

05:46.477 --> 05:47.518
(whispers) DOLL KILLER.

05:47.518 --> 05:49.380
MEREDITH GREY.
OKAY, COME WITH ME.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.522
O.R. TWO. RIGHT AWAY.

05:51.522 --> 05:53.684
(sighs)

05:53.684 --> 05:55.025
(lowered voice) OKAY,

05:55.025 --> 05:57.087
I AM GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE.

05:57.087 --> 05:58.389
REALLY?

05:58.389 --> 06:00.531
OKAY, UM, MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

06:00.531 --> 06:02.463
THE FACT THAT I KNOW THINGS
ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE

06:02.463 --> 06:04.395
IS ONE OF THE GREAT SADNESSES
OF MY EXISTENCE.

06:04.395 --> 06:05.536
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:05.536 --> 06:06.867
AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO KNOW ABOUT MINE

06:06.867 --> 06:08.038
IS EXPONENTIALLY WORSE,

06:08.038 --> 06:09.540
BUT I DON'T SEE
HOW WE GET AROUND IT.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.101
(clears throat)
OKAY.

06:11.101 --> 06:12.503
WE'RE ABOUT TO OPERATE
WITH DR. WARREN.

06:12.503 --> 06:14.475
HE AND I ARE... INVOLVED.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.407
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

06:16.407 --> 06:17.748
CAN YOU NOT PRETEND?

06:17.748 --> 06:19.750
OH, OH. (lowered voice)
YOU AND DR. WARREN? WOW.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.983
UH, HE IS GOING TO TRY
AND DISCUSS PERSONAL MATTERS

06:22.983 --> 06:24.515
IN THE O.R. TODAY,

06:24.515 --> 06:25.986
AND I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN.
OKAY.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.459
OKAY, SO I'M GOING TO
TEACH YOU A LOT.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.761
AND YOU ARE GONNA ASK
QUESTIONS--A LOT.

06:30.761 --> 06:33.093
AND IF HE GETS
A PERSONAL WORD IN EDGEWISE,

06:33.093 --> 06:35.095
I WANT YOU TO FORGET WHICH IS
THE BUSINESS END OF A SCALPEL

06:35.095 --> 06:36.467
REAL QUICK

06:36.467 --> 06:37.968
AND ASK FOR HELP.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.070
OKAY, BUT LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

06:40.070 --> 06:42.803
YOU PULLED ME OUT OF
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME SURGERY

06:42.803 --> 06:44.935
TO BE A BUFFER BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND?

06:44.935 --> 06:46.637
OH, DON'T USE THAT KIND
OF LANGUAGE WITH ME.

06:46.637 --> 06:50.511
(people speaking indistinctly)

06:50.511 --> 06:51.982
SPINAL SEPARATION COMPLETE.
(cell phone rings and buzzes)

06:51.982 --> 06:54.084
I HAVE TO GO. TEDDY.

06:54.084 --> 06:55.586
(sighs) IT'S BEEN
TWO WEEKS NOW.

06:55.586 --> 06:56.987
YOU NEED A BREAK,
AND SHE DOES, TOO.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.589
I GOTTA GO.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.451
OKAY, I AM NOW PREPARED

07:00.451 --> 07:01.922
TO SEPARATE THEM COMPLETELY.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.454
WAIT. HOLD ON.
WHAT ABOUT COMPLICATIONS?

07:03.454 --> 07:04.695
I MEAN, WHAT IF THERE'S
A DOUBLE HEMIVERTEBRA

07:04.695 --> 07:06.156
OR A TETHERED CORD?

07:06.156 --> 07:07.598
(sighs)
WE WILL CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN WE COME TO IT.

07:07.598 --> 07:09.600
WE'RE DONE HERE.
I-I'M SORRY.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.431
WHAT IF WE'RE STANDING
ON THAT BRIDGE RIGHT NOW?
DR. ROBBINS, I SAID--

07:11.431 --> 07:13.464
NO, NO, NO, NO. WE HAVEN'T
EVEN SEPARATED THEM YET.

07:13.464 --> 07:15.005
WE HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH
THE POST-SEPARATION SURGERIES.

07:15.005 --> 07:16.537
DR. ROBBINS, STOP.

STAY PUT, KEPNER.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.650
YANG.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.821
FROM THE BEGINNING?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.122
YES.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.855
VITALS WERE STABLE
AFTER RECEIVING L.R.

10:24.855 --> 10:26.226
AND PACKED CELLS.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.898
THE BRONCH WAS ALREADY PLACED
WHEN I ENTERED THE O.R.

10:27.898 --> 10:29.730
SO I PROCEEDED
WITH THE LASER ENDOSCOPY

10:29.730 --> 10:31.131
USING THE C-O-2 LASER.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.833
STEP BY STEP.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.906
I HAD GOOD VISUALIZATION
OF THE TUMOR ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.

10:35.906 --> 10:37.968
ABOUT 80% OF THE TUMOR
HAD BEEN VAPORIZED

10:37.968 --> 10:39.369
WHEN THE BLEEDING BEGAN.

10:39.369 --> 10:41.271
HE HAD CLOTS,
WHICH WERE BLOCKING MY SCOPE.

10:41.271 --> 10:43.914
I PASSED A BRUSH THROUGH
THE SCOPE TO CLEAR THE FIELD.

10:43.914 --> 10:46.016
HOWEVER, HENRY'S HEMORRHAGING
WAS SO SEVERE...

10:46.016 --> 10:47.317
SUCTION, KEPNER.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.921
KEPNER, SUCTION.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.885
(suction gurgling)

10:54.885 --> 10:56.086
YANG?

10:56.086 --> 10:58.759
HENRY'S HEMORRHAGING
WAS SO SEVERE

10:58.759 --> 11:00.931
THAT THE BRUSH
DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

11:00.931 --> 11:02.833
SATs DROPPED TO 88.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.865
BLOOD WAS
COMING OUT OF THE E.T. TUBE.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.897
AT THAT POINT, DR. WEBBER
EXERCISED HIS JUDGMENT

11:06.897 --> 11:08.238
AND STEPPED IN.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.941
WE CRACKED HIS CHEST
AND TRIED TO GET TO THE SOURCE.

11:10.941 --> 11:12.943
HENRY BECAME BRADYCARDIC

11:12.943 --> 11:14.905
SO WE PUSHED ATROPINE.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.206
THEN I REALIZED,

11:16.206 --> 11:18.408
THE TUMOR HAD ERODED THROUGH
THE PULMONARY ARTERY.

11:18.408 --> 11:19.950
HE FLATLINED.

11:19.950 --> 11:23.053
WE DID A.C.L.S. PROTOCOL
AND GOT SINUS BRADY.

11:23.053 --> 11:24.885
WE PUSHED HIGH-DOSE EPI.
HE FLATLINED AGAIN.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.017
WE DID MORE COMPRESSIONS.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.759
WE CONTINUED IN THIS MANNER

11:28.759 --> 11:30.761
UNTIL DR. WEBBER AND I
BOTH AGREED

11:30.761 --> 11:34.324
THAT SINCE HE ALREADY LOST
MORE THAN HALF HIS BLOOD VOLUME,

11:34.324 --> 11:36.026
HIS HEART COULD NOT RESTART.

11:36.026 --> 11:38.098
WE CALLED TIME OF DEATH--
8:52 P.M.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.100
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:40.100 --> 11:42.733
(suction gurgling)

11:42.733 --> 11:45.005
AGAIN.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.407
WHEN I ENTERED THE O.R.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.780
HENRY'S VITALS
HAD BEEN STABLE.

11:49.780 --> 11:50.941
HE HAD RECEIVED L.R.
AND PACKED CELLS.

11:50.941 --> 11:52.282
THE BRONCH WAS ALREADY PLACED

11:52.282 --> 11:54.945
SO I PROCEEDED
WITH THE LASER ENDOSCOPY.

11:54.945 --> 11:58.819
AND THEN THANKS TO THE UNHEALTHY
LEVEL OF COMFORT SHE FELT

11:58.819 --> 12:00.290
WORKING FOR HER HUSBAND,

12:00.290 --> 12:02.993
SHE TOOK SOME LIBERTIES
WITH THE CLINICAL TRIAL

12:02.993 --> 12:05.055
AND NOW NEITHER OF THEIR CAREERS
WILL EVER BE THE SAME.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.356
YOU KNOW,
I WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK

12:06.356 --> 12:08.098
TO DIVIDING
THE GASTROCOLIC LIGAMENT,

12:08.098 --> 12:09.860
BUT I'M NOT SURE
I REMEMBER HOW TO--

12:09.860 --> 12:11.902
FIGURE IT OUT.
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS,

12:11.902 --> 12:15.005
IT'D BE NICE TO MAINTAIN
SOME BOUNDARIES

12:15.005 --> 12:16.907
SO A PERSON'S LIFE
DOESN'T FALL TO PIECES

12:16.907 --> 12:18.038

12:18.038 --> 12:19.940
FOR THE RECORD, MY LIFE IS
PRETTY GREAT RIGHT NOW.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.012

13:01.111 --> 13:02.382

WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

WITH BENEFITS.

13:06.056 --> 13:07.958

13:23.273 --> 13:25.805

EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM

13:25.805 --> 13:27.277

EVEN IF I HAVE TO SIT AROUND
WITH JUDGY DOCTORS.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.953
I WASN'T JUDGING YOU.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.554
REALLY. I-I JUST...

13:44.554 --> 13:46.556
I WAS THINKING

13:46.556 --> 13:48.128
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

13:48.128 --> 13:52.162
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
THAT YOU LOVE.

13:52.162 --> 13:55.005
LOOKS LIKE ANDI HAS THE BULK OF
THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE COLON.

13:55.005 --> 13:56.006
SO WE'LL GIVE HER
ALL THE COLON THEN?

13:56.006 --> 13:57.207
AND LEAVE BRANDI WITH
AN ILEOSOTOMY?

13:57.207 --> 13:59.369
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'LL DO AN ILEOPROCTOSTOMY.

13:59.369 --> 14:01.111
MAYBE THEY SHOULD JUST
SHARE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO--

14:01.111 --> 14:02.242
NO. WE'LL DO IT MY WAY.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.413
CHECK THE FUNCTION OF
THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE KIDNEY.

14:03.413 --> 14:05.175
(Owen) FLIP'S COMING UP,

14:05.175 --> 14:08.078
AND I DON'T WANT A REPEAT
OF THIS MORNING'S REHEARSAL.

14:08.078 --> 14:09.519
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:09.519 --> 14:11.521
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

14:11.521 --> 14:13.183
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
ABOUT IT.

14:13.183 --> 14:15.886
WE PRACTICED THAT FLIP BEFORE,
AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT.

14:15.886 --> 14:17.127
AND TODAY--

14:17.127 --> 14:19.059
ROBBINS DOESN'T TRUST ANYBODY
TODAY.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.460
GET TO YOUR POINT,
KAREV.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.992
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SCREW THIS UP.

14:21.992 --> 14:23.133
WE GOTTA BE THE PERFECT TEAM.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.935
AND YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE
DOING IT WITH HER?

14:24.935 --> 14:26.466
SHE'S MAKING EVERYBODY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.168
I GET IT. YOU DON'T NEED
TO SAY ANOTHER WORD.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.940
WHO WANTS TO REPLACE KAREV
ON THE FLIP?

14:29.940 --> 14:31.942
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

14:31.942 --> 14:33.974
UH, I'LL DO IT.

14:35.005 --> 14:36.146

14:50.460 --> 14:51.661
YOURS OVER MINE, BABIES--

14:51.661 --> 14:53.023
DON'T. DON'T.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.524
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING
THE FLIP?

14:54.524 --> 14:56.026
(sighs) WEBBER
SNAKED IT FROM ME.

14:56.026 --> 14:58.068
WEBBER?
BUT HE HASN'T PRACTICED.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.569
YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING THIS
FOR TWO WEEKS.

14:59.569 --> 15:01.171
YEAH, TELL HIM THAT.

15:01.171 --> 15:03.433
I TOLD THE PARENTS
THAT YOU'VE PRACTICED.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.535
I TOLD THEM THAT YOU
HAD THIS THING DOWN COLD.

15:05.535 --> 15:07.407
(Arizona) OKAY, ONE...

15:07.407 --> 15:08.638
TWO...

15:08.638 --> 15:09.509
THREE.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.985
(Richard) EASY, EASY, EASY.

15:14.985 --> 15:16.616
I HOPE HE DROPS HER.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.089
HOW'S HE GONNA LIKE IT WHEN
ONE TWIN'S PUSHING HER SISTER

15:19.089 --> 15:22.152
IN A WHEELCHAIR
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?

15:22.152 --> 15:23.653
I'M JUST PISSED AT WEBBER.

15:23.653 --> 15:25.295
YOU'RE JUST... A MONSTER.

15:25.295 --> 15:26.396
AND WE'RE DONE.

15:26.396 --> 15:27.557
(Richard and Arizona chuckle)

15:27.557 --> 15:28.558
(man) WHOO-HOO!
(man) ALL RIGHT!

15:28.558 --> 15:31.301
OH, GOOD. OKAY.

15:31.301 --> 15:32.602
NICE WORK.
(woman) WELL DONE.

15:32.602 --> 15:34.504
(woman) ALL RIGHT!

15:34.504 --> 15:36.236
(woman) RIGHT?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.567
HE FLATLINED AGAIN.

15:37.567 --> 15:38.708
THEN DR. WEBBER AND I DECIDED

15:38.708 --> 15:40.510
THAT WITHOUT
ANY BLOOD LEFT TO CIRCULATE,

15:40.510 --> 15:41.641
HIS HEART WOULD NOT RESTART,

15:41.641 --> 15:44.674
SO WE CALLED TIME OF DEATH
AT 8:52 P.M.

15:44.674 --> 15:46.446
TELL ME ABOUT THE TUMOR.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.677
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:47.677 --> 15:50.020
THE TUMOR HAD ERODED
THROUGH THE PULMONARY ARTERY.

15:50.020 --> 15:51.481
(beeping continues)

15:51.481 --> 15:52.522
OKAY.

15:55.325 --> 15:56.526
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:56.526 --> 15:57.527
KNOW WHAT?

15:57.527 --> 15:59.089
WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE TUMOR

15:59.089 --> 16:01.591
ERODED INTO
THE PULMONARY ARTERY,

16:01.591 --> 16:02.692
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

16:02.692 --> 16:04.034
THERE WAS A HOLE
IN THE ARTERY.

16:04.034 --> 16:05.665
DID YOU ACTUALLY
SEE THE ARTERY?
I FELT IT.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.237
YOU JUST BLINDLY FELT IT?

16:07.237 --> 16:08.568
(beeping continues)

16:08.568 --> 16:09.699
IT WASN'T A BLIND FEEL.

16:09.699 --> 16:13.673
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING.
I TRACED IT WITH MY FINGERS.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.545
(beeping continues)

16:15.545 --> 16:17.347
UH-HUH.

16:17.347 --> 16:19.549
IT WAS THE POSTERIOR SEGMENTAL
ARTERY. I'M SURE OF IT.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.081
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.682
YOU NEVER GOT A VISUAL.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.256
I-I FOLLOWED
THE TRACHEAL BIFURCATION.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.388
IT CAME DIRECTLY OFF
THE MAIN PULMONARY ARTERY.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.690
OKAY, KEPNER, LET'S GET A FEW
OF THESE LYMPH NODES FOR BIOPSY

16:30.690 --> 16:33.523
AND THEN GET READY TO CLOSE.

16:35.765 --> 16:38.468
I DIDN'T CALL IT
WITHOUT BEING SURE.

16:38.468 --> 16:40.530
(instrument clicks)

16:40.530 --> 16:42.602
FROM THE TOP, YANG.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.236
(suction gurgling)

16:46.236 --> 16:50.380
UM, HIS VITALS WERE STABLE
AFTER RECEIVING FLUIDS.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.442
HE WAS UNDER ANESTHESIA,

16:52.442 --> 16:54.544
AND THE BRONCH WAS PLACED
WHEN I ENTERED THE O.R.

16:54.544 --> 16:57.147
SO I PROCEEDED
WITH THE LASER ENDOSCOPY

16:57.147 --> 16:59.689

16:59.689 --> 17:01.351

17:01.351 --> 17:02.552

17:02.552 --> 17:04.224
DR. BAILEY, OP NOTES DONE.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.725
DO YOU MIND IF I
RUN OUT FOR A MINUTE

17:05.725 --> 17:07.026
UNTIL
THE NEXT PATIENT'S READY?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.398
HE'S GONNA BE HERE
30 MINUTES FROM NOW.

17:08.398 --> 17:10.060
I KNOW. I CAN GET OUT
AND MAKE IT BACK IN THAT TIME.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.162

17:12.162 --> 17:14.634

17:38.588 --> 17:40.690

17:40.690 --> 17:42.092

17:42.092 --> 17:44.694

THE FLAP IS WELL-VASCULARIZED,
HAS GOOD CAP REFILL,

22:52.642 --> 22:54.644
AND IS COVERING
THE DEFECT PERFECTLY.

22:54.644 --> 22:56.506
I NAILED IT.

22:56.506 --> 22:58.508
DID AVERY NAIL HIS?

23:02.452 --> 23:03.953
WHAT'S GOING ON, AVERY?

23:03.953 --> 23:05.785
YOU SHOULD'VE FINISHED
YOUR FLAP BY NOW.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.487

23:07.487 --> 23:09.719
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
A CALL WHEN YOU'RE READY?

23:09.719 --> 23:11.561
HER KIDNEY'S
COMPLETELY NECROTIC.

23:11.561 --> 23:13.463
(monitor beeping erratically)
V-TACH.

23:13.463 --> 23:14.924
OKAY, PUSH 30 MILLIGRAMS

23:14.924 --> 23:16.566
SHE'S ALREADY SHOWING
SIGNS OF RENAL FAILURE.

23:16.566 --> 23:18.097
HER KIDNEY
WAS FINE EARLIER.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.599
MAYBE SOMETHING CAUSED
AN ARTERIAL SPASM WHILE WE

23:19.599 --> 23:21.531
WERE CHECKING THE FUNCTION
OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY.

23:21.531 --> 23:22.932
I DON'T KNOW, BUT AT THIS POINT,
I DON'T THINK IT'S SALVAGEABLE.

23:22.932 --> 23:25.404
SHE HASN'T HAD ANY URINE OUTPUT
SINCE SHE'S BEEN IN THIS O.R.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.806
(voice breaking)
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.508
SOMETIMES COMPLICATIONS
CAN ARISE.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.879

YOU DOCTORS
TALKED US INTO THIS.

YOU PROMISED US
THAT YOU COULD DO THIS.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.617
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
DR. GREY?

23:37.617 --> 23:38.888
SHE'S SAYING

23:38.888 --> 23:40.820
THAT OUR
PERFECTLY HEALTHY DAUGHTER

23:40.820 --> 23:42.792
STARTED THE DAY SHARING

WE'RE BRINGING HIM
STRAIGHT FROM THE E.R.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.521
SO WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME, PEOPLE.

24:11.521 --> 24:12.882
LET'S GET HIM
ON THE TABLE.

24:12.882 --> 24:14.654
DR. YANG, ARE YOU
SCRUBBING IN THIS TIME?

24:14.654 --> 24:15.825
(Teddy and Cristina) NO.

24:15.825 --> 24:17.086
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT.

32:04.493 --> 32:06.295
37.

32:06.295 --> 32:07.596
38.

32:07.596 --> 32:10.059
39. NOPE.
THE X-RAYS ARE HERE.

32:10.059 --> 32:11.460
OH. LOOK, KEEP LOOKING.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.332
UH, DR. BAILEY,
WE HAVE TO CLOSE.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.234
HE'S BEEN UNDER TOO LONG.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.535
YOU HAVE BOARDS COMING UP.

32:16.535 --> 32:19.238
IS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT
ON YOUR RECORD?

32:20.609 --> 32:22.611
WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE
LIKE A WHIPPED PUPPY.

32:22.611 --> 32:24.343
CHECK UNDER THE LIVER AGAIN.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.344
IT'S--IT'S NOT UNDER
THE LIVER.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.515
EXCUSE ME?

32:26.515 --> 32:27.616
IT'S NOT IN THE PATIENT.

32:27.616 --> 32:31.350
(sighs) DR. GREY, I-I THOUGHT
I TAUGHT YOU THE SIMPLE,

32:31.350 --> 32:34.453
RELIABLE RULES, LIKE WHEN YOU
DON'T FIND THE PROBLEM

32:34.453 --> 32:36.955
ON YOUR FIRST LOOK,
CHECK AGAIN.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.387
DOUBLE-CHECK, TRIPLE-CHECK
IF YOU HAVE TO.

32:38.387 --> 32:40.429
WE DON'T THROW OUR HANDS UP
IN MY O.R.

32:40.429 --> 32:43.392
WHEN A MAN'S LIFE
IS AT STAKE.

32:43.392 --> 32:46.635
DR. BAILEY, THE SPONGE IS
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SHOE.

32:46.635 --> 32:48.467
ON THE...

32:48.467 --> 32:49.968
WH--

32:49.968 --> 32:51.500
(squishes)

32:51.500 --> 32:54.103
(Miranda) UGH. OH.

32:54.103 --> 32:56.075
FOCUS...

32:56.075 --> 32:57.676
LIKE A LASER.

32:59.408 --> 33:01.150
(laughs)

33:09.258 --> 33:10.589
WHY AREN'T WE GETTING
ANY URINE?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.121
THERE'S A KINK
IN THE VESSELS.

33:12.121 --> 33:13.262
PAPAVERINE, PLEASE.

33:13.262 --> 33:15.524
HEY, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
AND NOT KAREV?

33:15.524 --> 33:17.326
HE WAS THE ONE WHO
SUGGESTED THE TRANSPLANT.

33:17.326 --> 33:19.728
I PICKED KAREV'S POCKET.

33:19.728 --> 33:21.570
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:21.570 --> 33:22.731
YOU WHAT?

33:22.731 --> 33:25.034
TWICE IN ONE DAY, KAREV?

33:25.034 --> 33:26.375
HONEST TO GOD...

33:26.375 --> 33:29.038
IT WAS LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM A BABY.

33:29.038 --> 33:30.309
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.211
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE BABY.
(laughs)

33:32.211 --> 33:34.243
IT WAS EASIER THAN TAKING
CANDY FROM A BABY.

33:34.243 --> 33:36.315
AT LEAST THE BABY PUTS UP
A BIT OF A FIGHT.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.586
(Arizona laughs)

33:37.586 --> 33:39.548
REMOVING CLAMP.

33:39.548 --> 33:40.689
WHOO!
AHH!

33:40.689 --> 33:42.651
YES! OH, WE GOT IT.
WE HAVE URINE.

33:42.651 --> 33:45.194
THE KIDNEY'S WORKING.
WE DID IT.

33:45.194 --> 33:47.126
(applause)
(man) GOOD JOB.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.257
(inhales)

33:48.257 --> 33:50.299
DR. WEBBER EXERCISED
HIS JUDGMENT AND STEPPED IN.

33:50.299 --> 33:52.101
SO WE CRACKED HIS CHEST

33:52.101 --> 33:53.232
AND TRIED TO TAMPONADE
THE BLEEDING

33:53.232 --> 33:54.403
AND GET TO THE SOURCE.

33:54.403 --> 33:56.265
HE BECAME BRADYCARDIC,

33:56.265 --> 33:57.506
SO WE PUSHED ATROPINE.

33:57.506 --> 34:00.469
UM, I THEN REALIZED
HE HAD LOST SO MUCH BLOOD

34:00.469 --> 34:01.810
BECAUSE HIS--

34:01.810 --> 34:05.244
THE TUMOR HAD ERODED
THROUGH THE PULMONARY ARTERY.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.750
RIGHT.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.122
THAT'S WHEN HE FLATLINED.

34:13.122 --> 34:14.283
WE DID COMPRESSIONS...

34:14.283 --> 34:15.324
PUSHED EPI,
GOT A SINUS BRADY...

34:15.324 --> 34:17.356
PUSH HIGH-DOSE EPI...

34:17.356 --> 34:20.058
WHICH IS WHEN
HE FLATLINED AGAIN.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.161
YES.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.462
(exhales)

34:23.462 --> 34:26.135
(crying) AND YOU
AND DR. WEBBER AGREED

34:26.135 --> 34:28.297
THAT HE HAD LOST
TOO MUCH BLOOD...

34:28.297 --> 34:29.568
YES.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.071
AND DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH LEFT
TO CIRCULATE,

34:33.071 --> 34:34.743
SO HIS HEART...

34:34.743 --> 34:36.575
WOULD NOT RESTART.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.147
YES.

34:41.510 --> 34:45.154
SO YOU CALLED TIME OF DEATH.

34:45.154 --> 34:47.416
(both) 8:52 P.M.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.267
(exhales deeply)

34:58.267 --> 35:00.469
I'M SORRY.

35:00.469 --> 35:02.271
OH, YOU DON'T APOLOGIZE.

35:02.271 --> 35:06.305
YOU HEAR ME?
YOU DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.378
YOU DID EVERY SINGLE THING

35:09.378 --> 35:11.280
THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.612
YOU WERE ME
IN THAT O.R.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.614
YOU WERE GOOD

35:15.614 --> 35:17.386
AND YOU DID IT RIGHT.

35:17.386 --> 35:20.589
HE JUST...

35:20.589 --> 35:22.551
HE JUST...

35:22.551 --> 35:26.555
(sobbing)

35:26.555 --> 35:28.227
(inhales)

35:28.227 --> 35:30.329
HE JUST DIED.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.332
(continues sobbing)

35:37.506 --> 35:40.609
(crying)

35:40.609 --> 35:42.371
(sniffles)

35:44.273 --> 35:47.376
(continues crying)

35:47.376 --> 35:51.280
(indistinct conversations)

36:00.929 --> 36:03.161
(sighs)

36:08.437 --> 36:10.739
I HAD A HUSBAND
AND A BABY

36:10.739 --> 36:12.441
AND I WAS A SURGEON.

36:12.441 --> 36:14.203
I HAD IT ALL.

36:14.203 --> 36:16.205
AND THEN IT ALL...

36:16.205 --> 36:17.576
TURNED BAD.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.509
SO I GOT DIVORCED.

36:20.509 --> 36:22.451
AND THEN I GOT BACK
ON MY FEET.

36:22.451 --> 36:24.953
I FOUND YOU.

36:24.953 --> 36:27.616
AND THEN THERE WAS
A SHOOTING.

36:27.616 --> 36:31.460
SO NOW I AM FINALLY
BACK ON MY FEET

36:31.460 --> 36:32.961
AGAIN

36:32.961 --> 36:35.564
AND I HAVE YOU AGAIN.

36:41.270 --> 36:43.802
I JUST DON'T WANT IT
TO BLOW UP.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.734
(chuckles) OKAY.
YOU--YOU'RE SCARED.

36:45.734 --> 36:47.406
SEE, ALL RIGHT, NOW...

36:47.406 --> 36:48.877
I AM, TOO.

36:48.877 --> 36:51.340
WHY CAN'T WE BE SCARED
IN THE SAME HOUSE? (laughs)

36:51.340 --> 36:53.482
WELL, DON'T ACT LIKE
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED.

36:53.482 --> 36:56.485
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED. WE JUST
TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME.

36:56.485 --> 36:58.547
PUT A TOOTHBRUSH
IN MY HOUSE TODAY.

36:58.547 --> 37:00.349
TOMORROW, MAYBE
A COUPLE PAIRS OF SOCKS.

37:00.349 --> 37:02.251
THEN A SUITCASE
ON THE WEEKEND--

37:02.251 --> 37:03.652
I HAVE A CHILD.

37:03.652 --> 37:05.454
I CAN'T JUST MOVE IN
WITH YOU.

37:05.454 --> 37:07.556
WAIT. YOU--YOU HAVE A CHILD?

37:07.556 --> 37:08.827
WHOA. WHEN DID--
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.359
OH, STOP--
YOU ARE NOT A FUNNY MAN.

37:10.359 --> 37:12.431
I MET HIM. RICK, RIGHT?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.802
(sighs) IT WAS A MISTAKE

37:13.802 --> 37:16.335
TO EVEN ENTER INTO
THIS CONVERSATION.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.537
T. REX VERSUS MEGALOSAURUS--
WHO WINS?

37:18.537 --> 37:19.708
WELL, I HAVE NO IDEA.

37:19.708 --> 37:20.909
YOU KNOW WHO DOES?

37:20.909 --> 37:23.512
I DO,
AND SO DOES TUCK.

37:23.512 --> 37:24.913
MEGALOSAURUS IS
A TENTH OF THE SIZE.

37:24.913 --> 37:26.715
T. REX EATS MEGALO
EVERY TIME.

37:26.715 --> 37:28.717
BUT T. REX VERSUS
PTERANODON, THOUGH--

37:28.717 --> 37:29.948
BEN--

37:29.948 --> 37:31.620
PTERANODON CAN FLY.
THAT'S AN EASY WIN.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.322
UNLESS YOU THINK
THAT'S A FORFEIT.

37:33.322 --> 37:34.653
YEAH, I CAN DO THIS
ALL DAY,

37:34.653 --> 37:36.355
AND SO CAN TUCK.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.527
YOU'RE BORED ALREADY, AND WE'VE
BEEN AT IT 30 SECONDS.

37:38.527 --> 37:41.460
I LIKE TUCK.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.261
I LIKE HANGING OUT
WITH TUCK.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.294
I LIKE DINOSAURS
AND TRANSFORMERS

37:45.294 --> 37:47.796
AND... I LIKE YOU.

37:47.796 --> 37:52.541
I... WANT
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

37:52.541 --> 37:54.803
(sighs)

37:54.803 --> 37:57.576
I KNOW YOU DON'T COME
WITHOUT TUCK.

37:58.707 --> 38:00.509
I KNOW THAT.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.315
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

38:12.961 --> 38:14.723
(chuckles)

38:17.526 --> 38:19.668
SO THAT'S IT?

38:19.668 --> 38:22.030
NOTHING?

38:24.503 --> 38:26.074
MY TOOTHBRUSH

38:26.074 --> 38:27.606
IS IN MY LOCKER.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.682
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.654
(surgical staff
speaking indistinctly)

38:45.654 --> 38:47.556
OOH! HA HA.
SORRY, GUYS.

38:47.556 --> 38:49.758
HA HA.

38:49.758 --> 38:51.099
SO THAT WENT WELL TODAY.

38:51.099 --> 38:53.331
HMM. YOU WERE A MONSTER.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.033
NO, NO, NO, NO,
I WAS JUST--I WAS AMPED UP.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.805
(computer error sound dings)
OKAY.

38:56.805 --> 38:58.807
YEAH. I THINK PEOPLE
FOUND ME HELPFUL.

38:58.807 --> 39:00.639
OH. MM-HMM. OKAY.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.040
(laughs)

39:02.040 --> 39:03.412
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THE TWINS,

39:03.412 --> 39:04.673
THEN I'M GONNA
HEAD HOME.

39:04.673 --> 39:05.874
HEY, COULD YOU, UM,
PUT THE HUMIDIFIER ON

39:05.874 --> 39:07.045
IN SOFIA'S ROOM?

39:07.045 --> 39:08.877
SHE SEEMED A LITTLE
CONGESTED THIS MORNING.

39:08.877 --> 39:10.579
YEAH, I NOTICED THAT.
YEAH, BUT DON'T GIVE HER
ANYTHING FOR IT.

39:10.579 --> 39:11.820
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE THERE YET.
ALL RIGHT.

39:11.820 --> 39:12.981
OH, AND GIVE HER
THE PINK BLANKET

39:12.981 --> 39:14.883
THAT YOUR FRIEND TERRY
GAVE US. SHE LIKES THAT.

39:14.883 --> 39:16.685
NO, NO, SHE DOESN'T--
UH, YES, SHE DOES.

39:16.685 --> 39:18.356
AND DON'T PUT IT
ON HER DIRECTLY

39:18.356 --> 39:19.658
'CAUSE SHE'LL JUST
FLING IT OFF.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.590
LAY IT DOWN ON TOP OF
THE SHEET, FUZZY SIDE UP.

39:21.590 --> 39:23.361
UH, EXCUSE ME.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.593
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
ARE YOU GETTING THIS?

39:24.593 --> 39:26.595
FUZZY SIDE UP, NOT DOWN. UP.

39:26.595 --> 39:27.736
NOT DOWN, UP.
(laughs) FINE, FINE, FINE.

39:27.736 --> 39:29.438
NOT DOWN. UP. MY WAY.
FINE, FINE.

39:29.438 --> 39:30.969
MY WAY.
FINE, FINE, FINE.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.901
I WAS A MONSTER.

39:32.901 --> 39:34.002
HEY, MIKE.

39:34.002 --> 39:35.073
HEY.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.675
YOU MIND
IF I GET STARTED?

39:36.675 --> 39:38.376
NO, NO, NO, GO AHEAD, MIKE.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.608
WE WERE JUST...

39:39.608 --> 39:40.579

39:40.579 --> 39:41.980
