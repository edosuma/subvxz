00:02.544 --> 00:03.086
- HEY, BABE.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.003
- 'SUP, DAD?

00:04.086 --> 00:06.589
- LOOKING GOOD,
DR. PHILLIPS.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.383
YOU KNOW,
EXERCISE IS IMPORTANT,

00:08.466 --> 00:12.804
ESPECIALLY FOR AN OLD DUDE.

00:12.887 --> 00:15.473
- OKAY,
WHY IS YOUR PHONE INSULTING ME?

00:15.557 --> 00:17.434
DON'T TELL ME
THERE'S AN APP FOR THAT.

00:17.517 --> 00:21.271
- IT'S NOT THE PHONE.
IT'S MY FRIEND MOLLY.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.441
BUT, YES,
THERE IS AN APP FOR THAT.

00:24.524 --> 00:29.529
MOLLY'S PARENTS DRAGGED HER
TO AFRICA ON A SAFARI.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.991
- SO I CAN BE BORED
SIX TIME ZONES AHEAD OF YOU.

00:33.074 --> 00:36.578
- GABBY,
SHE'S HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.829
YOU SHOULDN'T BE INTERRUPTING

00:37.912 --> 00:39.789
HER EXCITING FAMILY VACATION
WITH--

00:39.873 --> 00:40.874
- VIDEO CHAT'S FREE.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.542
- CARRY ON.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.422
HEY, SPORT.
DID WE WIN?

00:47.505 --> 00:48.089
- NO.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.799
WE GOT OUR BUTTS KICKED.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.552
WE LOOKED
LIKE LITTLE KIDS OUT THERE.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.471
- I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

00:54.554 --> 00:54.971
- IT'S OKAY.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.557
I FOUND A SNAIL.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.851
- SO DID THOSE SOCCER MOMS
LIKE YOUR HOMEMADE--

00:59.934 --> 01:01.144
WHAT WERE THEY AGAIN?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.730
- CRANBERRY RAISIN SQUARES.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.732
AND, NO,
THE MOMS BARELY TOUCHED THEM.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.235
THEY WERE TOO BUSY BOOING ME.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.695
- THOSE SQUARES WERE A BIT
ON THE STURDY SIDE,

01:10.779 --> 01:14.449
BUT NOT BOO-WORTHY.

01:14.532 --> 01:18.453
I MEAN, YAY,
MORE FOR US.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.788
- THEY BOOED HER BECAUSE
SHE CHEERED FOR THE OTHER TEAM

01:19.871 --> 01:21.956
AND DID HER HAPPY DANCE.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.168
[grunting]

01:25.251 --> 01:26.544
- I WAS CHEERING FOR AARON.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.630
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
HE WAS KICKING HIS BALL

01:28.713 --> 01:31.549
IN HIS OWN TEAM'S GOAL?

01:31.633 --> 01:35.553
- ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
THAT'S WHERE I FOUND MY SNAIL.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.974
- IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

01:40.058 --> 01:40.683
THE OTHER SOCCER MOMS
ARE ALL OVER THERE

01:40.767 --> 01:42.894
IN THEIR LITTLE CIRCLE,

01:42.977 --> 01:46.439
WITH THEIR COOL MINIVANS
AND SWEATPANTS.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.358
I JUST WANT TO BE THAT--

01:48.441 --> 01:51.194
WITHOUT TURNING INTO THAT.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.029
- ONE DAY THOSE MOMS
WILL INCLUDE YOU.

01:53.112 --> 01:55.615
THEY'LL SEE HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE,

01:55.698 --> 01:56.699
JUST LIKE I DO.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.368
- AW, YOU KNOW I LOVE IT

01:58.451 --> 02:01.538
WHEN YOU'RE ALL
SENSITIVE AND SWEATY.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.039
- STILL IN THE ROOM.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.543
- GABBY, RUN FOR IT,

02:06.626 --> 02:09.336
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I
JUST SAW TWO RHINOS DOING.

FROM JAMES' SCHOOL

02:52.046 --> 02:53.923
{\an8}INVITING MOMS TO JOIN
THE DANCE PLANNING COMMITTEE.

{\an8}- ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:04.767 --> 03:06.352
{\an8}BY SIXTH GRADE,
I HAD AN EX-BOYFRIEND

03:06.436 --> 03:10.607
{\an8}AND GOT AN ALIMONY PAYMENT
OF A CANDY BAR EVERY TUESDAY.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.525
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T PLAY
WHEN IT WAS LATE.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.152
{\an8}- DULY NOTED.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.236
{\an8}- DAD, GET WITH IT.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.155
{\an8}I AM TOTALLY INTO GIRLS.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.950
{\an8}- TOO BAD GIRLS AREN'T INTO YOU.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.578
{\an8}- IF GIRLS AREN'T INTO ME,

03:23.661 --> 03:25.330
{\an8}WHY DO I HAVE THREE HOTTIES

03:25.413 --> 03:27.415
{\an8}WAITING FOR ME
TO ASK THEM TO THE DANCE?

03:30.793 --> 03:33.504
- FOUR,
IF YOU COUNT GRANDMA MAGGIE.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.341
- DO NOT HELP ME.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.474
- OKAY NOW,
4 TIMES 6 IS...

03:44.557 --> 03:45.808
- 24.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.562
- SO 4 TIMES 7 MUST BE...

03:49.646 --> 03:53.232
- MORE?

03:53.316 --> 03:56.945
- WHAT IF I GAVE YOU
24 MARSHMALLOWS

03:57.028 --> 04:01.324
AND I GAVE JAMES 24 MARSHMALLOWS
PLUS FOUR MORE--

04:01.407 --> 04:03.534
- THEN HE'D HAVE...

04:03.618 --> 04:05.495
28,

04:05.578 --> 04:06.454
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.542
OH.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.879
- SOMETIMES, YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY
THE MARSHMALLOW CARD.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.675
- HI, HI, HI.

04:18.757 --> 04:19.300
- HEY, MAGGIE.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.260
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:21.344 --> 04:25.098
- A DATE WITH A VERY HANDSOME
COLLEGE PROFESSOR,

04:25.181 --> 04:26.683
SO YOU KNOW I NEED TO BE HOME,

04:26.766 --> 04:31.688
GETTING MYSELF TIGHT AND RIGHT.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.690
BUT STEPHANIE CALLED,
TALKING ALL CRAZY

04:33.773 --> 04:35.984
ABOUT RISING FROM THE ASHES,

04:36.067 --> 04:39.737
REPRESENTIN' FOR THE STEPMOMS.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.364
HAS SHE BEEN DAY DRINKING
WITHOUT ME?

04:41.447 --> 04:44.951
- SHE JOINED
A DANCE PLANNING COMMITTEE

04:45.034 --> 04:46.703
TO MAKE SOME MOM FRIENDS.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.121
FIRST MEETING'S TOMORROW.

04:48.204 --> 04:52.458
- OH, SHE GETS SO WORKED UP
MEETING NEW PEOPLE.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.251
THE NIGHT BEFORE KINDERGARTEN,

04:53.334 --> 04:57.714
HAD TO CHANGE HER SHEETS TWICE.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.549
SHE MAY BE GROWN NOW,

04:59.632 --> 05:02.385
BUT I WOULDN'T GIVE HER
A LOT OF LIQUIDS BEFORE BED.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.347
EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.311
- HEY.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.312
- HEY.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.319
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.240
- WHY?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

05:24.323 --> 05:26.743
- YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.329
NOW TELL ME WHAT I KNOW
YOU KNOW I KNOW.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.582
- HERE'S SOMETHING
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.750
- BET I KNOW.

05:33.833 --> 05:37.545
- I DON'T HAVE ANY HOTTIES
ON SPEED DIAL.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.884
- NOW I KNOW.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.428
LOOK, SON, YOU'RE 11.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.180
THERE'S NO NEED TO RUSH THINGS.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.598
- BUT I REALLY WANT
TO GO TO THE DANCE

05:48.681 --> 05:49.932
WITH DANA TOBIN.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.184
TWO ROWS OVER,
THREE CHAIRS DOWN.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.645
SMELLS LIKE CHOCOLATE MILK,
BUT IN A GOOD WAY.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.023
- THERE'S A BAD WAY?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.108
- OH, YEAH.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.611
CAN YOU HELP A BROTHER OUT?

06:01.694 --> 06:05.490
- WELL, THE LINE THAT ALWAYS
WORKED FOR ME WAS,

06:05.573 --> 06:09.285
"HI.
I'M A DOCTOR."

06:09.368 --> 06:10.453
- I THINK I CAN SELL THAT,

06:10.536 --> 06:13.956
BUT I NEED
TO BORROW YOUR STETHOSCOPE.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.416
- HOW ABOUT THIS...

06:15.500 --> 06:17.502
"DANA, I THINK
YOU'RE A REALLY NEAT GIRL,

06:17.585 --> 06:20.713
AND I'D LIKE
TO TAKE YOU TO THE DANCE."

06:20.797 --> 06:21.214
- WOW.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.132
- I KNOW.

06:23.216 --> 06:27.512
CLEAR, HONEST,
AND SMOOTH AS BUTTER, BABY.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.639
- NO--
WOW, WITH A RAP LIKE THAT,

06:29.722 --> 06:31.641
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU EVER
LANDED A BABE LIKE STEPHANIE.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.061
- HEY,

06:35.144 --> 06:38.439
DON'T CALL
YOUR STEPMOTHER A BABE.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.816
AND THANK YOU.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.573
- WOW, THAT IS SOME HIKE
FROM THE PARKING LOT.

06:47.657 --> 06:52.203
AND IN HEELS,
IT AIN'T NO JOKE, AM I RIGHT?

06:56.207 --> 06:59.836
HI, I'M STEPHANIE,
JAMES PHILLIPS' STEPMOM.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.004
- WE'D HEARD
CHARLIE GOT REMARRIED,

07:02.088 --> 07:03.881
AND HERE YOU ARE.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.467
WHAT A TREAT.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.010
- OH, FOR ME TOO.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.096
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT
GROUP OF MOMS TO BOND WITH.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.139
I TRIED THE SOCCER MOMS,

07:11.222 --> 07:14.892
AND THEY ARE CUCKOO
FOR CRAY CRAY.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.521
- MY WIFE IS A SOCCER MOM.
LORI TOMS.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.565
- LOVE LORI TOMS.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.528
- I'M LYNN LAWSON,
COMMITTEE CHAIR,

07:25.611 --> 07:27.864
AND THIS IS THE REST
OF OUR MERRY TROOP.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.073
YOU JUST MET DEE.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.283
THIS IS VERONICA,

07:30.366 --> 07:30.950
AND OUR QUIET ONE, HELEN.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.869
- HI.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.791
- WHY DON'T WE ALL SIT DOWN?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.334
- UM...

07:40.418 --> 07:43.212
- OH.
THERE'S A STOOL IN THE CORNER.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.340
- I LOVED YOU GUYS
AS SOON AS I READ THE E-MAIL.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.051
"COME ONE, COME ALL
TO PLAN THE SIXTH GRADE BALL."

07:49.135 --> 07:50.761
I SAW THE PALATINO FONT
AND THOUGHT,

07:50.845 --> 07:54.432
"THESE ARE SOME
SOPHISTICATED LADIES."

07:54.515 --> 07:57.852
- WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT EMAIL STILL WENT OUT.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.605
I MEAN, THE FOUR OF US
HAVE BEEN <i> THE</i> EVENT PLANNERS

08:00.688 --> 08:02.899
SINCE OUR KIDS
WERE IN KINDERGARTEN,

08:02.982 --> 08:05.359
BUT IT'LL BE NICE
TO HEAR SOME NEW IDEAS.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.861
- THEN LET'S GET
THIS PLANNING PARTY STARTED.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.614
WHOO-WHOO!

08:09.697 --> 08:09.780
OH.

08:12.783 --> 08:16.078
- SO WHAT DO WE WANT OUR
DANCE THEME TO BE?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.748
- WELL, I HAVE SOME
AMAZING IDEAS.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.335
HOW ABOUT
"UNDER THE CARIBBEAN SEA"?

08:22.418 --> 08:24.420
WE COULD HAVE STEEL DRUMS

08:24.503 --> 08:27.924
AND CUPCAKES WITH LITTLE
BEACH UMBRELLAS ON THEM.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.092
- WE CAN DO BETTER.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.470
- WHAT ABOUT AN
"ALICE IN WONDERLAND" THEME?

08:32.553 --> 08:33.471
- COULD BE A HOOT.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.722
- LOVE A GOOD HOOT.

08:35.806 --> 08:40.770
IN FACT, I FOUND A PUNCH
CALLED MAD HATTER.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.731
OH, WAIT.
THAT HAS TEQUILA.

08:43.813 --> 08:48.444
- OR HOW ABOUT
AN "UNDER THE SEA" THEME?

08:48.527 --> 08:49.862
- WAIT, DIDN'T I JUST--

08:49.946 --> 08:53.115
- I LOVE THAT.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.825
- ME TOO.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.245
- NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.621
- DID I MENTION
I'M A FOOD BLOGGER?

08:58.704 --> 09:01.707
BECAUSE I WROTE THIS WHOLE POST
ABOUT HOW THE RIGHT DESSERT

09:01.791 --> 09:03.167
CAN ALTER THE DYNAMIC
OF AN EVENT.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.002
IT'S PRETTY--

09:05.086 --> 09:07.922
[shrieking]

09:08.005 --> 09:09.048
- WHOOPSIE.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.386
- NO WORRIES.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.806
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
<i>MEANT</i> TO DO IT.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.184
- SO MOVING
ON TO THE INTERMINGLING ISSUE.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.604
SINCE THE BOYS AND GIRLS STAY
ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE GYM,

09:23.688 --> 09:26.315
I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER
SEPARATE REFRESHMENT AREAS.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.776
- I ACTUALLY HAVE SOME IDEAS

09:28.859 --> 09:30.861
ABOUT HOW
TO GET THE KIDS TO MINGLE.

09:30.945 --> 09:35.283
- STEPHANIE, YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING
A MOM FOR, WHAT, SIX MONTHS?

09:35.366 --> 09:40.246
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TRY OBSERVING FOR A YEAR OR TWO?

09:40.329 --> 09:43.082
OR MAYBE UNTIL
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN KIDS?

09:46.377 --> 09:48.462
- I SEE.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.089
I GET IT.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.926
IT'S PRETTY STANK,
BUT I GET IT.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.179
HOW ABOUT I
TAKE MY HOT FRESH IDEAS

09:57.263 --> 10:01.517
AND MY FLY HEELS
AND FIND A BETTER GROUP OF MOMS?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.269
OH.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.353
WHATEVER.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.813
THEY'RE STILL FLY.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.945
- 6 TIMES 8 IS...

10:13.029 --> 10:15.906
48.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.742
WILL THIS EVER END?

10:20.828 --> 10:24.040
- ROUGH DAY?
- DON'T GET ME STARTED.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.001
- [sighs]

10:29.462 --> 10:31.047
SUPER SECRET SECRET?

10:31.130 --> 10:33.591
- HIT ME.
