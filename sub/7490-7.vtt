00:02.208 --> 00:03.083
Guys,

00:03.166 --> 00:06.041
I got us the opportunity of a lifetime.
We're gonna be rich!

00:06.125 --> 00:08.417
For the last time,
your mom's car has a leak.

00:08.667 --> 00:11.041
There's no oil under your house.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.875
No, I signed us up for The Battle of the
Dance Crews competition at the mall.

00:14.959 --> 00:16.125
Check it.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.333
Whoa, first prize wins $1,000.

00:19.417 --> 00:22.083
It's not just about the money.
I've always loved dancing.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.208
You know, when I was a baby,
my mom hung a disco ball over my crib.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.458
Did it ever fall on your head?

00:29.959 --> 00:31.250
Did what ever fall on my head?

00:33.291 --> 00:34.834
Jerry, that sounds great,

00:35.208 --> 00:36.583
but we're not a dance crew.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.291
I have the skills
and I'll teach you the moves.

00:39.375 --> 00:41.333
And if we work hard,
we can win this together.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.250
- Now what do you say?
- I'm in.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.208
- Okay. Absolutely.
- Let's do it.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.166
Okay. Jerry, you got yourself a crew.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.125
Yeah.

00:48.208 --> 00:49.125
Wasabi?

00:49.875 --> 00:51.792
- Wasabi.
- Whoo!

01:36.625 --> 01:39.792
Is this just me or these falafel balls
greasier than usual?

01:43.250 --> 01:44.500
No, that looks about right.

01:46.583 --> 01:47.625
Oh, check it out.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.792
That's Dan Brennan.
He's the best dancer at our school.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.250
They call him Smooth.
- Ooh, nice.

01:53.333 --> 01:54.750
Because he's got great dance moves?

01:55.542 --> 01:57.208
And his skin's crazy soft.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.792
Yo, we're talking velvet.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.333
Hey, Jerry.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.583
- Jack.
- Eh.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.542
I heard you karate clowns
signed up for the dance contest.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.667
You know my crew, The Step Brotherz
win every year.

02:09.917 --> 02:10.792
Yeah, I know.

02:11.208 --> 02:13.917
Just 'cause you win every year
doesn't mean other people shouldn't try.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.500
Yeah, it kind of does.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.625
See, I suggest you leave the dancing to us

02:19.709 --> 02:21.583
and stay in your little karate club.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.542
You know, we're not just a karate club.

02:24.625 --> 02:27.542
We also offer free counseling to people
with bad nicknames.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.291
You should come by and see us,

02:29.625 --> 02:30.792
"Smooth".

02:32.709 --> 02:34.750
You guys are just gonna
embarrass yourselves.

02:34.834 --> 02:36.333
You might have some moves.

02:36.875 --> 02:37.917
But can you move...

02:38.583 --> 02:39.834
like Smooth?

02:50.291 --> 02:51.667
Yo, I can move like Smooth.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.750
It's just a split.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.417
I can do a split. Check it.

03:01.917 --> 03:03.667
I think your pants just ripped.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.709
That wasn't my pants.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.125
Sorry I'm late, Rudy.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.500
Just give me a minute,
and then we can get started.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.208
I'm sorry. Who's he?

03:24.542 --> 03:26.333
I don't know his name!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.083
I mean, what...
what are you doing with it?

03:29.542 --> 03:32.375
I bought a case of inflatable
men to sell to the police.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.250
I thought they could put 'em
in squad cars so people wouldn't speed.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.417
That's actually brilliant.
What'd they say?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.500
They said if I didn't leave
with my man balloon,

03:39.583 --> 03:41.625
they'd lock me up.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.709
In business you need to be creative.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.625
When life gives you lemons,
what do you do?

03:45.709 --> 03:47.041
Make lemonade.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.458
No, that's...

03:49.542 --> 03:52.542
-
- That's ridiculous. Why would you do...

03:52.625 --> 03:55.667
Lemons can be used to make lemonade.

03:58.667 --> 03:59.667
Marge,

04:00.333 --> 04:01.750
what would you say if I told you

04:01.834 --> 04:04.500
that I can take you and your inflatable
friend here to the next level?

04:04.583 --> 04:05.625
We're listening.

04:06.083 --> 04:08.417
Okay. Well, what if we dress him up
as something other than a cop?

04:08.500 --> 04:09.542
Say, uh...

04:16.709 --> 04:18.000
...A ninja.

04:19.667 --> 04:20.500
Yeah.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.250
If you had a ninja with you,
people wouldn't dare mess with you.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.000
Perfect for ladies that have to take
the bus home late at night.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.375
Yeah. And we can put an
inflation device in him

04:28.458 --> 04:30.458
so, he only blows up when you need him.

04:30.542 --> 04:33.458
That way he could stay small and people
could place him in their pocket.

04:33.542 --> 04:35.792
Ooh! You know what we can call it?
Ooh! Wait wait...

04:36.083 --> 04:37.166
Pocket Ninja!

04:37.250 --> 04:39.709
No, no, no.

04:39.792 --> 04:42.625
The name's gotta pop, you know,
something people will remember.

04:42.709 --> 04:43.583
How about, um...

04:44.250 --> 04:45.417
Tiny-Pants Friend?

04:48.083 --> 04:49.625
Pocket Ninja it is.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.583
<i>♪ Kickin' it now with you ♪</i>

04:56.625 --> 04:58.625
All right. Now, let's run
the whole thing from the top.

04:59.625 --> 05:00.667
Hey, where'd Kim go?

05:00.750 --> 05:03.250
She wanted to change into her dance gear.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.250
Okay, let's do this!

05:10.250 --> 05:12.542
What? This is how dancers dress.

05:12.625 --> 05:16.208
Maybe in the '80s in Poland.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.667
Come on, guys. We've got a lot
of work to do.

05:18.750 --> 05:19.625
Are you ready?

05:19.709 --> 05:20.834
- Yeah.
<i>I wanna see this.</i>

05:20.917 --> 05:22.375
I can't hear you.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.583
Really? 'Cause that was pretty loud.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.750
I think you might have some hearing loss!

05:29.208 --> 05:30.041
All right.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.709
Here we go. Whoo!

05:40.709 --> 05:42.625
<i>Ah, Esta gente que esta haciendo?</i>

05:42.709 --> 05:45.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cut! Stop!

05:45.625 --> 05:48.208
Okay, I taught you this.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.250
You guys are doing this!

05:53.125 --> 05:54.125
Come on, guys.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.208
Don't you have
any dancing experience at all?

05:57.083 --> 05:58.208
Well, uh...

05:58.291 --> 06:00.959
I have my own victory dance
I do every time I win a match.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.166
Ready?

06:06.625 --> 06:09.583
If that's your victory dance,
I'm gonna start rooting against you.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.250
It's been a while since
I've danced onstage,

06:13.333 --> 06:16.375
But I think I'm just
as good now as I was then.

06:23.959 --> 06:27.250
Milton, tell me there's a dancer
hiding in there somewhere.

06:28.041 --> 06:31.625
Oh, believe you me,
I have busted many a move.

06:43.375 --> 06:46.959
Eddie, please give me some good news here.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.959
Well, I did go to Mrs. King's
Dance Academy.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.959
Eddie, I don't know how to tell you this,

06:57.041 --> 07:00.291
but you are never going
to be a good dancer.

07:01.125 --> 07:02.250
Oh, that's okay.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.000
I don't come here for the dancing.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.041
Okay, this isn't working.

07:11.125 --> 07:13.041
Come on, guys, this is important to me.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.917
You gotta start trying.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.083
- Whoa, we're trying.
- Yeah.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.208
Maybe we should just take a break.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.083
-
- Fine.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.166
But before you go, think about this.

07:24.375 --> 07:25.583
When you dance, you...

07:25.667 --> 07:27.291
you gotta totally feel it.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.875
When I dance,
I'm not thinking about anything.

07:29.959 --> 07:31.375
My head is absolutely empty.

07:31.792 --> 07:34.250
Right, like right before an algebra test.

07:38.166 --> 07:42.041
Hey, you guys better be ready to work
when you get back.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.041
Is dancing so hard?

08:01.542 --> 08:02.750
What's up, Jerry?

08:05.000 --> 08:05.917
Smooth.

08:06.792 --> 08:07.834
What are you doing here?

08:07.917 --> 08:10.041
That was a pretty crazy move I saw you do.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.834
I've been working on it for a long time.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.792
I call it "The Jerry."

08:14.000 --> 08:15.250
How'd you come up with that?

08:17.417 --> 08:20.750
Well, I'm Jerry and I added the "the."

08:27.959 --> 08:29.583
Ladies, thanks for coming today.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.375
And a special shoutout to Marge

08:31.500 --> 08:33.583
for letting us use the
cafeteria after hours.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.250
Thank you, Rudy.

08:36.333 --> 08:39.542
A little heads-up. If you see a cockroach
in here, don't mess with it.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.041
We're in their house.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.291
Now.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.583
We are offering a security system
with a level of protection

08:47.667 --> 08:49.667
that you have never experienced before.

08:50.709 --> 08:51.709
I give you...

08:54.500 --> 08:56.834
"The Pocket Ninja."

08:58.125 --> 09:01.250
You can't put a price on the security
that the Pocket Ninja will bring you.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.792
- But we did anyway.
- And that price is $19.95.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.542
Girls, you're gonna love
your Pocket Ninja. He's dependable,

09:08.625 --> 09:10.542
- He's reliable.
- Is he a good kisser?

09:13.417 --> 09:14.542
You can put him in your house

09:14.625 --> 09:17.417
so an intruder can see him through
the window and get scared off.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.750
You can seat him in the
passenger seat of your car.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.458
- When you have...
- No one to talk to.

09:21.542 --> 09:22.500
Right?

09:23.959 --> 09:24.875
No.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.542
Yes.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.834
If you wanna talk to him, you can.

09:31.917 --> 09:35.000
If you wanna imagine
that he's talking to you, you can.

09:35.083 --> 09:38.000
He's never too busy for you
and he will never ever judge you.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.917
Mm-mm..

09:40.000 --> 09:41.458
Oh, I'll take one!

09:42.166 --> 09:43.834
- Wrap him up!
- Sold!

09:47.834 --> 09:49.959
Rudy, I think we're gonna
sell all 20 of these.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.834
Why sell 20 when you can sell 20 million?

09:52.917 --> 09:54.834
I think you know what I'm talking about.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.417
An infomercial?

09:57.959 --> 09:59.083
Yeah.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.667
Yeah. That's... that's what I was
gonna say... an infomercial.

10:03.375 --> 10:06.250
I wasn't for a moment talking about
putting 20 million in a shopping cart

10:06.333 --> 10:07.917
and selling them door to door. I mean...

10:08.709 --> 10:10.583
that would be insane.

10:11.041 --> 10:13.250
Take back the shopping cart.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.792
Look, you got talent,

10:21.166 --> 10:24.041
but you're wasting it trying to make
dancers out of a bunch of karate rats.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.041
Hey, those are my friends!

10:26.458 --> 10:27.750
But go on.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.250
Let me ask you something.

10:30.166 --> 10:32.208
Are you the best karate
student in that dojo?

10:32.792 --> 10:34.208
No. Jack is.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.834
Well, I'm gonna give you the chance
to be the best at something.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.041
Jerry,

10:40.041 --> 10:41.375
I want you in my crew.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.250
You in?

10:47.041 --> 10:47.917
Yeah.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.959
I guess so.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.959
Wow,

10:53.417 --> 10:55.000
even your hands are smooth.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.375
Dude, what your secret?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.375
I make my own cocoa butter.

11:02.834 --> 11:05.417
Jerry, what are you doing here?
We were waiting for you back at the dojo.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.834
A little change of plans...

11:07.166 --> 11:08.834
Jerry's a part of my crew now.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.250
He wants to dance with the best.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.667
What?

11:12.375 --> 11:13.458
Jerry, is that true?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.417
Yeah, it is true.

11:16.333 --> 11:17.834
Hey, Smooth's a great dancer.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.417
And he's my only real shot
to be a part of a winning crew.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.834
So, you would rather win
than be with your friends?

11:23.917 --> 11:26.208
Look, it's not about winning, okay?

11:26.792 --> 11:28.291
This guy also makes his own cocoa butter.

11:36.792 --> 11:39.125
- Up. Yeah-ah! Let's do this.
- Okay!

11:39.750 --> 11:42.208
- Man, you guys have it all.
- Yeah.

11:42.291 --> 11:45.125
Sweet dance studio, air-conditioning,

11:45.208 --> 11:46.625
your own bottled water?

11:46.709 --> 11:49.125
Yo, and this cocoa butter could really
knock the ash off my elbows.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.542
Whoa!

11:51.000 --> 11:52.625
Nobody touches my cocoa butter.

11:55.208 --> 11:58.000
So, this is the new guy.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.250
Well, he don't look like much.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.709
Back off, Benny.

12:01.792 --> 12:04.917
Jerry's been showing me
this crazy move for the last two hours.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
That's gonna win us the contest.
Let's show 'em.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.542
Whoo!

12:19.792 --> 12:21.792
- That's right.
- I've gotta give it to you, man.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.959
That was... was a pretty sweet move.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.125
Yeah, I'm gonna use it to win the contest.

12:26.625 --> 12:27.709
What?

12:28.125 --> 12:29.917
You're not gonna use my move.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.667
It's not <i>your</i> move.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.625
It's called "the Smooth."

12:34.709 --> 12:35.917
See... see what I did was,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.208
I took "the Jerry," took out "jerry"

12:38.250 --> 12:40.625
and replaced it with "Smooth."

12:40.709 --> 12:43.625
I guess I don't need you anymore, Jerry.

12:43.709 --> 12:44.917
See ya.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.625
You just got Smoothed.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.667
Whoo!

12:54.250 --> 12:55.500
Oh, man.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.250
He stole my "whoo" too.

13:06.959 --> 13:10.417
I'm going to have to ask you to stop that.
I'm on a date!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.959
Sorry for that terrible interruption.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.333
Well, if it isn't Eggs Benedict.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.500
You mean Benedict Arnold?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.959
No, I don't think I do.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.667
Should you be practicing with
your new Smooth dance friends?

13:33.333 --> 13:34.667
They're not my friends.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.667
Smooth just used me to steal my move.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.875
- They stole the Jerry?
- Yeah.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.125
And it's not called the Jerry anymore.

13:41.208 --> 13:44.375
Now it's called the Smooth.
He just named it after himself.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.542
Ah, zero imagination.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.375
Jerry, you got us so excited
about this dance thing.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.625
You said we were gonna do it
together and then you bailed on us.

13:56.667 --> 13:57.750
Yeah.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.500
Look,

14:04.625 --> 14:07.417
I'm never gonna be great at karate or...

14:08.041 --> 14:09.500
or a great school person.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.041
- Student.
- Whatever.

14:12.542 --> 14:14.542
Dancing is the one thing
I'm really good at.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.166
And I just wanted everyone to see that.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.959
But you guys are my friends, and...

14:20.542 --> 14:21.959
I shouldn't have walked out on you.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.208
So, I'm sorry.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.417
Jerry, wait!

14:33.709 --> 14:35.542
If you still wanna be in the contest,

14:36.333 --> 14:38.250
- We'll be your crew.
- Really?

14:39.792 --> 14:42.250
- Yes, the kid is back in the game.
-

14:42.375 --> 14:44.667
- You guys are awesome!
- Not at dancing.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.750
We still stink.

14:46.125 --> 14:48.083
Yeah, would you excuse me, please?
I'm on a date!

14:50.583 --> 14:52.583
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

14:53.417 --> 14:55.542
I gotta be honest. I'm a little nervous.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.291
Millions of people are gonna see this.

14:57.709 --> 15:00.083
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Marge.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.250
I don't get nervous.
I'm cool as a cucumber.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.625
Besides, if we mess up, they'll simply
stop the cameras, and we'll start over.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.542
- It's not like we're doing it live.
-

15:08.625 --> 15:10.333
We're live in five seconds.

15:10.417 --> 15:11.625
What?

15:12.291 --> 15:15.500
- And four, three, two, and...
- No-no, I can't do live. I've never...

15:18.542 --> 15:20.458
<i>Rudy, we're on. Say something..</i>

15:26.583 --> 15:29.375

15:29.458 --> 15:31.500
<i>Hi, to my TV friends.</i>

15:33.583 --> 15:35.333
<i>Aah!</i>

15:35.625 --> 15:36.834
<i>Do... do you</i>

15:36.917 --> 15:39.083
<i>Do you sometimes wish
that you had a ninja?</i>

15:39.542 --> 15:41.250
<i>I know I do!</i>

15:41.667 --> 15:42.959
<i>I do!</i>

15:44.583 --> 15:45.750
<i>Well, now you can...</i>

15:45.834 --> 15:49.583
<i>With this amazing
new product called the Ninja Pocket.</i>

15:49.667 --> 15:52.000
<i>- Pocket Ninja.

15:53.542 --> 15:57.375
<i>Well, tell us how
this exciting new product works.</i>

15:57.792 --> 15:59.291
<i>Why are you asking me?</i>

16:00.500 --> 16:04.667
<i>I bet it's easy and quick
and ready in a flash, huh?</i>

16:04.750 --> 16:05.625
<i>Okay.</i>

16:07.250 --> 16:08.750
<i>Um, simply um...</i>

16:09.208 --> 16:11.333
<i>Pull the ninja out of your pocket...</i>

16:13.250 --> 16:15.041
<i>And pull the activation chord.</i>

16:15.125 --> 16:16.458
<i>It's easy. Watch.</i>

16:18.500 --> 16:20.000
<i>See? It's ready in a flash.</i>

16:21.834 --> 16:23.041
<i>Come on.</i>

16:23.125 --> 16:24.458
<i>Come on!</i>

16:24.542 --> 16:26.500
Get it together! You are embarrassing us.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.500
This piece of junk doesn't work!

16:38.458 --> 16:39.667
I mean,

16:40.250 --> 16:41.834
ta-da!

16:46.583 --> 16:47.417
What is happening?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.542
They must be heating up under the lights!

16:51.000 --> 16:52.208
Whoa.

16:53.709 --> 16:56.625
I'm gonna be a lunch lady forever!

17:01.500 --> 17:02.750
Mommy!

17:07.458 --> 17:09.709
I guarantee you'll love your Ninja Pocket.

17:09.792 --> 17:11.959
- Pocket Ninja!
- Pocket Ninja!

17:28.625 --> 17:30.834
Wow, how about that?

17:31.166 --> 17:33.500
Come on, people, give it up
for the Step Brotherz.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.250
Did you see that last move?

17:36.375 --> 17:37.667
That was crazy!

17:37.750 --> 17:39.875
How do you come up
with something like that?

17:40.375 --> 17:42.333
- By stealing it.
Yeah!

17:43.709 --> 17:47.375
Now, let's give it up for the
last act of the competition...

17:47.709 --> 17:50.917
The Wasabi warriors.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.500
Good luck with your little
loser friends, Jerry.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.542
I just crushed it.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.500
I better go clean out my pockets
to make room for my prize money.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.542
I wouldn't do that just yet, Smooth.

18:03.709 --> 18:06.375
We've got a routine that is pretty swag.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.125
I told you before, those
guys aren't dancers.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.208
All they know about is karate.

18:10.417 --> 18:11.792
Exactly.

18:11.959 --> 18:12.875
Dude, we're on!

18:33.458 --> 18:35.041
Oh, hyah!

18:49.125 --> 18:50.709
It's time for your new move, man.
It's all you.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.208
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.667
Wasabi!

19:20.667 --> 19:23.583
Wow, that was awesome.
I have the judges' results.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.291
The winner of the trophy
and the $1,000 prize.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.250
Is...

19:29.166 --> 19:30.709
The Step Brotherz!

19:31.125 --> 19:32.542
Whoo!

19:33.208 --> 19:35.375
- I thought you guys were awesome.
- Hmm.

19:36.125 --> 19:37.750
I was proud to have you as my crew.

19:38.166 --> 19:42.500
This year, the judges are also awarding
a trophy for best individual dancer.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.500
And the winner is...

19:45.917 --> 19:47.375
Jerry Martinez!

19:50.834 --> 19:52.458
What? Jerry?

19:52.917 --> 19:54.458
He's not that great.

19:54.542 --> 19:55.959
I can do what he did.

19:56.041 --> 19:56.917
Watch this.

19:57.709 --> 19:58.625
Whoa!

20:05.375 --> 20:08.417
Not very smooth, Smooth. Whoo!

20:08.542 --> 20:11.625
Yeah, that's right.
I'm taking my "whoo" back.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.542
Uh, yeah, I'd like to thank
my mom, my dad,

20:21.625 --> 20:24.458
Rudy, my crew...
Couldn't have done it without you guys.

20:24.542 --> 20:27.166
Oh, and uh one last thing
I'd like to say is,

20:27.250 --> 20:28.834
five, six, seven, eight, and...

20:35.959 --> 20:38.000
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

20:39.166 --> 20:41.542
It's a good thing the company agreed
to take these back.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.542
Oh...

20:42.625 --> 20:44.291
Joan, what's wrong?

20:45.250 --> 20:46.375
He left me!

20:47.750 --> 20:49.291
My little ninja is gone.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
What do you mean by gone?

20:52.083 --> 20:54.834
He sprung a leak and he flew
out the window.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.709
Now, he's just hanging
on my neighbor's satellite dish.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.417
Why does it always end this way? Why?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.792
Girl, it's not your fault.

21:03.875 --> 21:06.583
I wish I had a dollar for every man
I lost out a window.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.709
Hey, Joan,

21:10.959 --> 21:12.959
have you met my friend Donald?

21:17.250 --> 21:20.083
Why, no, I haven't had the pleasure.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.542
So sudden.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.834
Why don't me, you and Donald
go get a frozen yogurt?

21:23.917 --> 21:27.000
Oh! So, Donald, tell me everything
about yourself.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.959
Girl, he's no good anyway. Come on!

21:30.041 --> 21:31.875
My gosh!
