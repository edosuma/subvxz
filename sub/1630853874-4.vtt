WEBVTT

00:11.553 --> 00:13.638
<i>This is Devi Vishwakumar,</i>

00:13.722 --> 00:16.725
<i>a 16-year-old girl</i>
<i>from the San Fernando Valley…</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:21.021
<i>…and now Paxton's ex-girlfriend.</i>

00:21.104 --> 00:21.938
<i>Remember this?</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:23.356
Look, I'm sorry.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.444
<i>The moment where Devi blew it</i>
<i>with her dream man for the second time.</i>

00:27.527 --> 00:30.447
<i>Yeah, we all lost something that day.</i>

00:30.530 --> 00:34.159
<i>As you can imagine,</i>
<i>she did not take it well</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:37.871
<i>and plunged headfirst</i>
<i>into all of the stages of breakup grief.</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:38.872
<i>She raged.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:40.874
-<i>She wallowed.</i>

00:41.833 --> 00:45.045
<i>And after several long,</i>
<i>pretty-hard-to-watch months,</i>

00:45.628 --> 00:47.338
<i>she finally accepted it.</i>

00:47.839 --> 00:51.468
<i>Also, this little bit</i>
<i>was supposed to show the passing of time,</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:54.345
<i>but there aren't any seasons</i>
<i>in Southern California.</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:57.307
<i>See, there are some little pumpkins</i>
<i>on the porch.</i>

00:57.390 --> 01:02.228
<i>Anyway, now she was back to being</i>
<i>her normal nerdy, Indian virgin self</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:04.355
<i>and was finally at peace with her breakup,</i>

01:05.273 --> 01:08.735
<i>and could now smile at Paxton</i>
<i>without bursting into tears.</i>

01:08.818 --> 01:11.321
Hi.
<i>-Well, that is until she heard the news.</i>

01:11.404 --> 01:13.239
Paxton has a new girlfriend.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.117
<i>Yep.</i>
<i>Hard to be at peace with that.</i>

01:23.374 --> 01:24.334
How you feeling?

01:25.418 --> 01:27.003
You want a hit off my inhaler?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.379
No. No. I'm fine.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.132
I knew this day would come,
and I feel very prepared for it.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.551
-Who is it?
-Phoebe Hayward.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.679
Handjob Hayward?
Sherman Oaks' hugest skankosaurus.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.223
Could he stoop any lower?

01:38.723 --> 01:41.226
I'm sorry.
That wasn't very feminist of me.

01:41.726 --> 01:45.355
I'm sure all the rumors about her
were perpetuated by the patriarchy.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.232
<i> It's interesting</i>
<i>how women can't rage</i>

01:47.315 --> 01:51.194
<i>without thinking about it in the context</i>
<i>of other people's oppression.</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:53.071
<i>I'm really happy I'm a man.</i>

01:53.154 --> 01:53.988
You okay?

01:54.072 --> 01:56.241
Uh-- Yeah. I'm all right.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.159
I know it sucks he moved on before you,

01:58.243 --> 02:00.120
but it's not like
you're a loser or anything.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.455
Look at Aneesa.
She hasn't dated anyone since Ben.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.665
She hasn't, right?

02:03.748 --> 02:07.001
You would know better than we would.
You guys are like such good friends now.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.337
Oh yeah, we're good friends now.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.967
<i>Devi, please pick up some extra</i>
<i>toilet paper on your way home tonight.</i>

02:14.050 --> 02:17.137
<i>And not the cheap kind.</i> <i>My guests deserve</i>
<i>the one that feels like a little quilt.</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:21.099
Great. While Paxton's banging the captain
of the gymnastics team,

02:21.182 --> 02:23.476
I'll be making sure
a bunch of elderly butts are clean.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.894
-Huh?
-Uh-- Nothing.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.313
My grandma's just throwing a party
for Navaratri tonight.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.690
What's Navaratri?

02:28.773 --> 02:32.610
Oh, Navaratri is a nine-day Hindu festival
that commemorates the great battle

02:32.694 --> 02:35.738
between the demon Mahishasura
and goddess Durga. Right, Devi?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.741
Yeah. That's… That's basically it.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.910
<i> She has no clue</i>
<i>what Navaratri is.</i>

02:40.994 --> 02:43.204
Ugh! It's gonna be all old people.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.374
I wish I wasn't so terrified of drugs,
so I could be high for it.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.835
Oh, wait.
Trent and Paxton are coming over.

02:48.918 --> 02:52.130
And I'm like, "Grandma, stop trying to eat
your toothbrush. It's not a hot dog."

02:52.213 --> 02:53.965
<i> Thanks to their best friends,</i>

02:54.048 --> 02:58.261
<i>Devi and Paxton were occasionally forced</i>
<i>into awkward moments like this.</i>

02:58.344 --> 02:59.554
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.264
Hey, babe. Hey, babe's friends.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.392
So as you may have heard,
today is my 18th birthday.

03:04.475 --> 03:08.396
You announced it over the loudspeaker
in the middle of the Pledge of Allegiance.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.522
Good ear, Crazy Devi.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.650
Anyway, I would like
to give you, Paxton, my best friend,

03:12.734 --> 03:16.654
and you, Eleanor, my girlfriend, a chance
to throw me a birthday party tonight.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.781
Oh, okay.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.492
Kind of late notice,
but I guess we can do that.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.577
Of course we can.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.121
Oh my God, you guys,
that's so generous of you.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.497
We could do it at my place.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.709
My folks will be in Morongo trying
to gamble back the car they lost.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.378
Cool. So, what are you thinking
theme-wise?

03:32.462 --> 03:35.924
I would love to throw an <i>Age</i>
<i>of Innocence </i>party with little masks.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.343
I want this
to be the most insane, puke-filled rager

03:38.426 --> 03:40.762
in the history of the school
and everybody has gotta come.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.598
Eleanor, bring your friend.
Friend, bring your robot.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.393
Paxton, bring your new girlfriend.
And, Paxton, bring your old girlfriend.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.647
Oh, uh, Trent,
I actually can't come tonight.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.858
It's a huge Hindu holiday.
So gotta celebrate that.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.612
Oh, that's a bummer to hear, but honestly,
we're not really that close of friends.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.364
So I'm not going to change the date, okay?

03:59.447 --> 04:00.406
Okay.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.332
Hey.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.251
Oh. Uh, hi.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.836
So, listen,
I know why you're not going to Trent's.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.672
You've heard of Navaratri too?

04:15.755 --> 04:18.007
Damn. Was it in an episode
of <i>Indian Matchmaking?</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:20.385
Devi, come on.
I know you're not very religious.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.679
You're not going to Trent's
because of Phoebe, right?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.264
No, no, no, no. It's a real holiday.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.350
It's about-- Hold on.
Let me talk to Fabiola.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.434
No, no. It's okay.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.229
All I wanted to say is
I know we haven't talked in a while,

04:31.312 --> 04:34.190
but I-I'm really sorry
if this Phoebe thing hurts you.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.233
Hurts me?

04:35.733 --> 04:37.443
No. I'm fine, brosef.

04:37.527 --> 04:42.448
I'm also talking to people,
loads of guys, so…

04:42.532 --> 04:45.785
Okay. I thought we could
have an honest conversation here,

04:45.868 --> 04:48.121
but maybe it's too soon for that.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.125
Uh-- I was being honest.

04:52.208 --> 04:57.088
It's a real holiday,
and I'm happy, and healthy, and Hindu.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.799
You should've seen
the look of pity on his face.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.218
He, like, totally thought I was lying.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
You were kinda lying
about talking to loads of guys.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.639
No, I wasn't.
I talked to like ten guys today.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.642
When you bitched out the percussion
section for being off tempo?

05:09.726 --> 05:11.019
And what about it, Fabiola?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.938
Okay. Listen, you have to go
to Trent's tonight.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.358
Yeah. Otherwise, you're gonna seem
so heartbroken and pathetic,

05:17.442 --> 05:18.693
maybe even borderline obsessed.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.945
Which I'm not. I'm totally fine.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.989
I know, which is why you have to go.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.283
Yeah.
But how do I get out of Navaratri?

05:25.867 --> 05:28.619
Devi-- How are you not dressed yet?

05:28.703 --> 05:31.289
Get ready,
and go bring your grandmother the butter.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.916
-She has a bangle stuck on her wrist.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.377
Oh!

05:38.087 --> 05:38.921
Bye.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.136
<i>Pati, </i>your Golu is so fire.

05:45.219 --> 05:50.266
Like, look at this. You got Lord Ganesha,
Durga, Lakshmi, you know, all the OGs.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.184
That's right.

05:51.267 --> 05:55.188
But then you got some straight-up flare
like this little crystal dolphin

05:55.271 --> 05:56.981
or DIY Sanjay Gupta.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.983
-Hubba-hubba.
-Yo.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.402
You are gonna own
all the other aunties' Golus.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.154
It's not a competition, Devi.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.448
Yeah, right.
The whole reason you throw a Golu

06:05.531 --> 06:07.200
is so you can stunt
on the other old ladies.

06:07.283 --> 06:10.161
-Am I right, <i>Pati?</i>
-Yes.I plan to stunt hard.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.748
That's why I have
this pièce de résistance.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.542
-Uh, what is that?
-A Bloomie's bag.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.127
Not even from the outlet.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.547
And there's even a receipt inside
from my Shiseido's perfume.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.843
That gossipy cow Smita
is gonna faint when she sees this.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.846
<i>Mami, </i>why did you invite Smita
if you hate her so much?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.056
Because she's my friend.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.601
Although I know she's going to go on
and on about her granddaughter's wedding

06:33.684 --> 06:34.852
at the Universal Studios.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.272
If only I could have something
to brag about to her.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.942
Well, you could tell her
that I've been dating a very nice teacher

06:41.025 --> 06:42.402
who I like very much.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.820
No.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.989
Why won't you go out with any of the other
young men I've introduced you to?

06:47.073 --> 06:51.494
Because, once again, I am seeing Manish,
and if you just give him a chance--

06:51.577 --> 06:52.787
I have given him many chances.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.873
Surprising him with pop quizzes
on Indian history is not a chance.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.334
It would have been
had he gotten any answer right.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.212
You need to find someone
who cares about our culture.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.924
That Manish probably thinks a Golu
is a GoPro camera for the toilet.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.760
Damn, <i>Pati.</i>
That was a savage burn.

07:08.719 --> 07:09.762
Sorry, Kamala.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.223
So, where should we put Sanjay?

07:12.306 --> 07:15.518
If he's in the center,
the Golu will be too sexy.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.937
-Hey!

07:18.563 --> 07:19.480
Hi.

07:23.401 --> 07:27.363
Okay. We've got three kegs courtesy of
the adult lady Uber driver I flirted with.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.867
-So we should be set for the evening.
-Get me up, boys. Yeah!

07:30.950 --> 07:33.077
And now the boy becomes a man.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.120
Feed me.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.247
-Aw. Trent seems happy.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.582
Yeah, he does.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.542
Hey, listen.
Could you check on Devi tonight?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.669
She seemed kind of upset
when I talked to her today.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.504
We've been out of touch for a while.

07:43.588 --> 07:47.175
-I just wanna make sure she's okay.
-Oh, I'm sure she is.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.469
-I don't think she cares about your girl--
-Hey!

07:49.552 --> 07:51.596
Oh wow! You look amazing!

07:52.638 --> 07:55.057
Oh, shit. Those are some small clothes.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.772
You have to pump it and tilt your cup,
or it's gonna be all foam.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.941
God, have you never been
to a party before?

08:04.025 --> 08:07.069
No. I was sick for a really long time.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.572
Oh. Sorry.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.534
Oh my God! What's your problem?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.078
How are you even condescending about beer?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.290
I'm not condescending. I get annoyed
when people don't know how to do things.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.917
The problem with you, Ben,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.336
is that you think
you're so much smarter than everyone else.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.130
And you're not.
This is why Aneesa dumped you.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.716
Whatever.
And I am smarter than most people.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.926
You're not smarter than me.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.596
Well, I mean, sure, you got a whole
robotic science nerd thing going on,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.681
but I'm great in all my classes.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.017
You are so full of yourself.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.770
I bet I can beat you
in any subject. Name one.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.772
Fine. How about history?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.065
Fantastic.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.525
Hey, Trent, do you still have

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
our American History textbook
from freshman year?

08:47.652 --> 08:50.446
Uh, yeah. I think it's propping up
my grow lamp upstairs.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.033
All right, history it is.
And you know what?

08:54.116 --> 08:56.285
Let's make it interesting.
A drinking game.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.204
If you get one wrong, you drink.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.540
First person to tap out loses.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.667
You're on, and I'll never tap.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.253
I come from a long line
of high-functioning alcoholics.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.589
And I come from a long line of people
who never get any questions wrong.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.592
-Hmm.
-Also, I'm really sorry about your family.

09:14.178 --> 09:18.849
And then after the vows,
we went to the Transformers ride,

09:18.933 --> 09:21.477
and Optimus Prime gave his blessings.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.646
-It was stunning.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.148
<i>You are </i>not <i>going to believe this.</i>

09:27.108 --> 09:29.277
<i>This is what Phoebe is wearing!</i>

09:29.360 --> 09:34.156
Oh, I will. We'll probably do something
at Disneyland, with probably 2,000 people.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.993
Although, I don't know how
we'll whittle down the guest list to that.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.369
-Really?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.329
But who will be getting married?

09:40.413 --> 09:45.001
We'd heard about how things didn't go
so well with that handsome engineer.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.336
Oh, such a shame.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.089
What's a real shame
is how quickly your face-lift has relaxed.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.633
Okay. Okay.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.468
We'll just talk about something else.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.138
So Rhyah made the <i>sundal.</i>
Isn't it delicious?

09:57.221 --> 09:59.849
Rhyah, can you please list
every ingredient in this dish, please?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.935
Yeah, no, of course. So there's chickpeas
that are organic and locally sourced,

10:03.019 --> 10:04.478
-which does matter--

10:04.562 --> 10:07.273
-Locally sourced from--
-Sorry. I have to take this call.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.109
-Please don't.
-I'm so sorry. I know. Sweetheart, hi.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.278
Wait, we can be on our phones? BRB.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.031
Apparently, I have to be
the cartoon hot dog

10:15.114 --> 10:18.701
before the movie starts
and ask everyone to silence your phones.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.704
-Yo.
-<i>What's the latest?</i>

10:21.787 --> 10:23.414
-Can you get out?
-<i>I don't know how.</i>

10:23.497 --> 10:25.249
There's aunties parked at every exit.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.337
It's tighter security than a Sephora.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.255
Well, Paxton just asked me
to check on you.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.007
I think he thinks you're like locked away

10:33.090 --> 10:35.843
in your room descending
into madness, à la <i>Queen's Gambit.</i>

10:35.926 --> 10:39.096
Ugh! Damn. I just wish
I had some kind of distraction.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.893
-Hello?
-Holy shit. Mr. K.?

10:43.976 --> 10:45.936
Polite as always, Devi.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.814
Hey, El. I think I just found my window.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.484
-Hi, Manish. Welcome.
-What is he doing here?

10:51.567 --> 10:55.488
Well, I thought Manish could come over
and celebrate our culture with us,

10:55.571 --> 10:58.574
-and you could get to know one another.
<i>-Vanakkam,</i> Auntie.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.494
All right, cool it, WikiFeet.

11:01.577 --> 11:05.247
-Yep. Sorry. It felt weird for me too.
-Well, who do we have here?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.750
This is just Devi's teacher Mr. Kulkarni.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.754
He has stopped by to congratulate Devi
on being such a great student.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.464
And he's also my boyfriend.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.717
Oh. Please come have a seat.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.303
Let us get to know you. Mmm? Come.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.806
Hey, Mom, it seems like
there's a lot going on down here.

11:21.889 --> 11:25.226
So I'm just gonna go upstairs to my room
for a sec. Got a little bit of a headache.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.186
<i>Enna,</i> <i>kanna?</i> Yeah. Sure.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.864
You are no one's obsessed, sad sack ex.

11:39.740 --> 11:40.574
Yeah.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.496
Hmph!

11:47.456 --> 11:50.292
-Hey! What are you doing?

11:50.876 --> 11:52.420
Ah…

11:52.503 --> 11:56.132
It was so weird. My contact blew out
of my eye and then onto the roof.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.135
-So--
-Get back inside. Now.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.011
Okay.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.014
Your punishment is to sit
and watch the aunties chew.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.308
-Okay.
-Now hand out the <i>vadais</i>. Go.

12:10.688 --> 12:14.316
Nirmala Auntie, I couldn't help but notice
how impressive your Golu is.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.363
It is a beautiful tribute
to the goddess and her nine avatars.

12:19.447 --> 12:24.243
Last year, my Golu was seven steps,
two more than Nirmala's.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.079
But your steps had a lot of empty spaces.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.040
I… I think five steps
shows appropriate restraint

12:30.124 --> 12:32.585
in avoiding the consumerism
of the holiday.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.629
Thank you, Manish.
That's very kind of you to say.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.173
Help yourself to a <i>vada.</i>

12:38.299 --> 12:39.467
I could have a couple.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.509
-Just one.
-Just--

12:40.593 --> 12:41.427
Okay.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.222
-Rhyah, I was looking for you.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.266
Sorry. I was having a moment.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.768
Oh no.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.520
Are you okay? What's going on?

12:52.396 --> 12:54.315
I was just talking to my son.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.735
He's just finished
this high school program at sea

12:57.818 --> 12:59.987
for aspiring marine biologists.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.782
And he actually studied a sea slug colony.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.159
Ever since he got back,
his friends won't hang out with him,

13:05.242 --> 13:06.994
and one even called him Dork Cousteau.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.747
And now he's home alone,
and it just breaks my heart.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.708
<i>If there was one thing</i>
<i>Nalini could relate to,</i>

13:12.792 --> 13:16.003
<i>it was the pain</i>
<i>of having your nerdy child ostracized.</i>

13:16.086 --> 13:17.463
I know what that's like.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.465
People have called my daughter
all sorts of names.

13:19.548 --> 13:23.093
I wish I could just go and make him
some new friends instead of those little,

13:23.177 --> 13:25.012
pardon my language, assholes.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.016
But I know I can't.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.394
Go see your friends and--

13:32.478 --> 13:36.190
Okay. Wait, so now you want me
to go to the party at Trent's house?

13:36.690 --> 13:37.650
Are you having a stroke?

13:37.733 --> 13:40.110
No. I take a baby aspirin
with my tea every morning.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.403
Okay. Then, what's up?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.947
I want you to go to the party,

13:43.030 --> 13:45.074
and I want you
to take Rhyah's son with you.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.909
What? Who's Rhyah's son?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.787
He's a sweet boy who has no friends
and studies sea slugs.

13:49.870 --> 13:50.955
His name is Nirdesh.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.081
Nirdesh?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.582
Are you kidding me?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.919
Yeah, that sounds like a parody
of an Indian nerd. I'd rather just not go.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.380
What? You were so excited
about this party a minute ago.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.299
You were throwing your body off the roof.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.928
<i>Hey, not to alarm you,</i>
<i>but people overheard my call to you</i>,

14:06.011 --> 14:08.597
<i>and now they actually do think</i>
<i>you're descending into madness.</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:10.099
<i>So, get here soon, okay?</i>

14:10.182 --> 14:11.809
Ugh! Fine.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.687
I'll go to the party,
and I'll take Nirdesh with me.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.690
Excellent. And make sure
no one bullies him there.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.733
He's already been picked on enough.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.531
Hey, hey. I'm here.

14:25.614 --> 14:31.871
Hi. Oh my gosh, I don't know where Paxton
and Phoebe went, but you look so cute.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.665
When they see you, they're not gonna think
obsessive depressive.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.834
They're gonna think impressive successive.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.711
I think you mean successful.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.671
Yeah, but that doesn't sound as jazzy.

14:40.754 --> 14:44.466
Sure. So there's just one small,
tiny hiccup tonight.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.761
My mom wouldn't let me come unless
I brought one of her friends' loser kids.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.971
He's meeting me here.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.514
-Oh, this is him.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.391
"Hi, it's Nirdesh."

14:52.474 --> 14:53.601
"I'm running behind."

14:53.684 --> 14:56.395
"I spilled some <i>rasam </i>on my sweater vest
and had to change."

14:56.478 --> 14:57.730
"I should be there shortly."

14:57.813 --> 14:59.315
Yikes!

14:59.398 --> 15:01.734
This kid is like a medical-grade dork.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.569
Maybe we could tell everyone
he's my cousin.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.487
Ow! Ben.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.739
Sorry, David, but we need you.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.617
If I asked you who fought
at the Battle of Little Bighorn,

15:09.700 --> 15:12.328
and you said General Custard,
that should count, right?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.581
Custard is a dessert.
Custer is the general.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.207
Whatever! I've had four beers.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.542
What's the big deal?

15:18.626 --> 15:19.668
Drink, bitch.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.670
Ugh! You know what I meant.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.172
What are you guys doing?

15:23.255 --> 15:28.594
Playing a little drinking game called
<i>Are You Smarter Than a Ben?</i>

15:29.219 --> 15:30.721
-That was good.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.098
Oh my God. That is so lame.

15:33.182 --> 15:37.144
Ooh. What if I drop off my cousin
with these two

15:37.227 --> 15:38.854
while I go make an appearance with Paxton?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.522
-You have a cousin coming?
-I do.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.442
So if you see an Indian dork
come through that door, let me know.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.236
I see an Indian guy
coming through the door,

15:46.320 --> 15:49.114
but he definitely
does not look like a dork.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.959
Oh shit.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.755
I don't wanna jinx it,
but I think this is going really well.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.757
Your grandmother
even looked me in the eye once.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.425
I got too excited and I looked away.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.843
I know. I feel good about it too.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.804
What are you doing?

16:11.887 --> 16:14.640
Oh God, Manish.
Did you take that off the step?

16:14.723 --> 16:16.558
I thought someone put it there as trash.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.227
There's a receipt in it and everything.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.354
The receipt is what makes it so special.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.648
This Bloomie's bag represented
the American Dream,

16:22.731 --> 16:24.900
and you have filled it with dirty napkins.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.027
Oh my God. I am so, so sorry.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.612
-Ooh, do I hear drama?
-No!

16:30.239 --> 16:32.741
-Oh my God.
-Oh my God! Let me help you.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.035
No, uh, Manish.
I think maybe you should just go.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.913
-Are you okay?
-What are you doing? Who did this?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.624
-Does that hurt?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.920
Hi, Devi? I'm Nirdesh,
but my friends call me Des.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.838
Hi.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.424
How come your cousin's
introducing himself to you?

16:48.507 --> 16:51.510
What? I'm not her cousin.
Did you tell them I'm your cousin?

16:51.593 --> 16:54.221
Uh-huh.
I may have said that. Yeah.

16:54.304 --> 16:57.016
Only because she thought
you were gonna be a huge loser,

16:57.099 --> 16:58.434
which you're definitely not.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.021
You thought I was gonna be
a huge loser based on what?

17:02.104 --> 17:06.483
Well, because certain
cultural context clues and…

17:06.567 --> 17:07.526
Because I'm Indian?

17:08.318 --> 17:10.487
Okay, um, I think I'm good.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.489
Wait. Des, no. I'm so sorry.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.451
I did not mean to offend you.
But, hey, let's be honest.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.369
There's a lot of nerdy Indian guys.

17:17.453 --> 17:21.665
Don't know if you know this, but your name
does have the word "nerd" in it, so…

17:21.749 --> 17:25.294
Oh wow. You're the first person
who's ever said that to me.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.421
Definitely no one
in elementary school did.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.549
Look, it's… it's fine.
I've met a million of you before.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.885
You're one of those Indian girls
who only likes white guys,

17:32.968 --> 17:35.637
and thinks all Indian dudes
are just computer geeks

17:35.721 --> 17:37.556
or cheesy club rats
who wear too much cologne.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.266
No, that's not what I'm like.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.976
<i> That's exactly what she's like.</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:43.312
Okay, Des, I am so sorry.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.439
I didn't mean anything by it.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.025
Please just stay.
And let's go get a drink and--

17:53.906 --> 17:54.740
I'm sorry.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.710
Hey, you okay? What happened?

18:07.294 --> 18:10.172
One minute you were apologizing
to me for mild racism,

18:10.255 --> 18:11.548
the next, you're crying.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.718
Yeah, um, I'm sorry. Uh, that was my ex.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.806
Ah. Okay. I see.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.724
Yeah. Um…

18:21.892 --> 18:26.105
I thought I was ready
to see him with someone new.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.149
I'd been practicing
with stuffed animals from my room.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.193
Guess it didn't help.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.029
Well, look, now it's done.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.739
You saw your ex with someone else.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.533
You survived.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.035
That was the worst it's gonna be.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.246
Yeah, I guess.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.499
How does someone like you
not have any friends?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.501
What? I have tons of friends.

18:47.584 --> 18:52.089
My mom said to take you tonight
because all of your friends ditched you.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.299
Another reason
I kind of thought you were a dork.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.676
Oh.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.886
My mom loves to exaggerate.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.347
Only one of my friends
isn't talking to me right now

19:00.889 --> 19:02.891
and it's because
I hooked up with a girl he liked.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.061
Twist! So you're not a dork.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.896
You're just a bad person?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.566
No, I didn't know he liked her,

19:10.649 --> 19:13.694
and he should've said something before
I lived on a boat with her for 3 months.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.864
Everyone knows Semester at Sea
is a floating hookup party.

19:17.489 --> 19:21.785
<i>Shit. Was this kid somehow</i>
<i>making sea slug school sound hot?</i>

19:22.411 --> 19:26.331
Okay, so you're not a dork,
and you're not a jerk.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.543
So, you're a nice, cool person?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.546
Yeah, and maybe I can help you out.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.841
What if we went back in there
and made your ex jealous?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.386
Kind of seems fun, right?

19:55.068 --> 19:57.237
All right.
I think we're exactly in his eyeline.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.915
<i>Yes, Devi!</i>

20:07.998 --> 20:10.918
<i>Paxton's looking right at you,</i>
<i>and he seems jealous.</i>

20:11.543 --> 20:12.586
<i>It's working.</i>

20:13.086 --> 20:14.338
<i>Devi, why aren't you looking?</i>

20:16.048 --> 20:18.884
<i>Oh, wait. I see what's happening here.</i>

20:29.394 --> 20:31.104
-You okay?

20:31.188 --> 20:33.482
Oh yes! Someone's puking.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.985
Thank you, babe. I can't believe
all my birthday dreams are coming true.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.406
I'm really sorry I made you drink so much
in the lightning round.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.577
I knew I had you on Reconstruction.
I watched a PBS doc on it with Gears.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.120
It's okay. I deserve it.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.707
I know that I'm a dick sometimes.
I get why you don't like me.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.084
It's not that I don't like you.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.628
I just don't like how you've treated
my friends in the past.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.588
You were a real jerk to Aneesa.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.258
Yeah, can't argue with you on that one.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.302
And you were also so mean
to Devi for, like, years.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.845
Not fair. She was also mean to me.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.431
Yeah, but you called us the UN,
which was pretty brutal.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.724
Yeah, well, she broke my heart.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.310
She broke your heart?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.107
-Yeah, kinda.
-Oh.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.609
I didn't know it was that deep.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.488
You probably don't need
to tell her that. Okay?

21:22.656 --> 21:23.490
Okay.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.618
And I'll work on
not being so condescending.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.454
You got a deal.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.921
There is no goodie bag that can make up
for what has transpired tonight.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.675
Everyone is going to hear
about this disgraceful event, Nirmala.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.510
Put the oxygen mask on her.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.972
I would never let anyone
get injured at my Golu,

21:47.055 --> 21:49.224
because I know how to host properly!

21:49.308 --> 21:51.351
-I am so sorry about this, <i>Pati</i>.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.896
This is exactly why
I have my reservations about Manish.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.481
He made a mistake.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.484
And wasn't it a bit thrilling
to see Smita Auntie take a little tumble?

21:59.568 --> 22:04.740
All it did was prove that this man
has no respect for how things are done.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.160
And memorizing a Wikipedia page
doesn't change that.

22:08.243 --> 22:11.288
But he makes me really happy.
Doesn't that count for anything?

22:11.371 --> 22:13.373
Of course, I want you to be happy,

22:13.915 --> 22:15.959
but he is not a serious man.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.836
You don't want to be with someone

22:17.919 --> 22:20.297
who's constantly making messes
for you to clean up.

22:20.380 --> 22:23.675
That's not who he is.
He was trying really hard tonight.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.010
And look what happened.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.553
He crashed my party,

22:26.636 --> 22:29.765
ruined my Bloomie's bag,
and sent my frenemy to the hospital.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.225
I'm really sorry, <i>kanna</i>.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.436
I cannot support this relationship,

22:35.145 --> 22:37.898
and I would prefer
that you do not bring him over again.

22:39.107 --> 22:39.983
I understand, <i>Pati</i>,

22:40.984 --> 22:42.069
but I'm an adult.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.281
And I don't want to end things with him.
So perhaps the best way forward

22:47.199 --> 22:48.367
is for me to move out.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.544
Well, this is my house.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.092
Thanks again for tonight.
I had a really good time.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.009
I did too.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.303
It was kind of a rocky start…

23:09.638 --> 23:10.972
…but then it was good.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.978
Uh…

23:17.062 --> 23:19.773
I should probably go inside.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.108
Okay.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.025
Yeah. Um…

23:22.609 --> 23:23.735
Well, um…

23:24.569 --> 23:26.196
Can I text you sometime?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.200
Yeah. For sure.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.342
Oh, hi.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.719
You missed quite the evening here.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.013
Mmm, I saw. The neighbors
are gonna be creeped out

23:52.097 --> 23:54.224
by all the broken doll bits
in the recycling bin.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.142
Oh yeah.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.520
So Rhyah texted saying Nirdesh
had a good time tonight.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.355
Really? He did?

24:00.981 --> 24:02.816
Uh-- What exactly did she say?

24:03.608 --> 24:06.778
Just that you cheered him up,
so thank you for that, <i>kanna.</i>

24:06.862 --> 24:09.322
However, you're still grounded
for the rest of the weekend,

24:09.406 --> 24:13.493
and I will be asking your uncle to install
security cameras outside your window.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.162
Nothing gets past me.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.621
Good night.
