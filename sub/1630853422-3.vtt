00:20.270 --> 00:21.563
- Angelyne!

00:21.604 --> 00:23.314
- It was a real loss
to the city

00:23.356 --> 00:25.191
when Frederick's of Hollywood
closed.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.194
There is where
I get my underwear now...

00:28.236 --> 00:31.072
all handmade
and original, of course.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.574
- Yeah, of course.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.410
- I had billboards
all around here.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.662
I got famous just like that.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.582
- I was there for everything.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.250
I was on all the phone calls.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.419
I was on
all the billboard shoots.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.839
It's a nonstop roller coaster.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.885
You see, she's up there
with Marilyn, Greta Garbo.

00:51.926 --> 00:56.264
Classic Hollywood--that's
how I saw her from day one.

00:56.306 --> 01:00.268
<i>I came to town for work,</i>

01:00.310 --> 01:03.396
<i>and I figured</i>
<i>I'd do some sightseeing.</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:05.982
- "Simon & Simon,"
"Knight Rider,"

01:06.024 --> 01:07.734
and "The A-Team."

01:12.072 --> 01:16.493
<i>- There are moments in life</i>
<i>that defy all logic,</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:21.706
<i>when the cosmos decides</i>
<i>to bring you in on the secret.</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:23.375
- Yeah, I mean,
that was a bit much...

01:23.416 --> 01:27.379
<i>- And you just have</i>
<i>to be ready to listen.</i>

01:27.420 --> 01:30.298
Excuse me, Angelyne?
My name is Rick Krause.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.634
I'm a fellow artist
and a huge fan.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.512
I am in town
doing celebrity portraits,

01:35.553 --> 01:37.681
and to my mind,
God's honest truth,

01:37.722 --> 01:39.057
hand to my heart,

01:39.099 --> 01:43.978
no truer Hollywood celebrity
exists today than you.

01:53.405 --> 01:56.032
<i>- She liked my paintings</i>
<i>so much,</i>

01:56.074 --> 01:58.702
<i>she asked if I'd help out</i>
<i>around the office.</i>

01:58.743 --> 02:02.414
<i>Just basic stuff, you know--</i>
<i>calls, bills.</i>

02:02.455 --> 02:04.749
She knows it's a drought,
but she needs the water.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.668
How many--
how many gallons of water

02:06.710 --> 02:08.962
is the actual quota
that you're ra--

02:09.004 --> 02:10.046
Well, isn't there, like,

02:10.088 --> 02:12.465
a celebrity dispensation
or something?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.676
The woman needs to ablute.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.429
Would you please, ma'am,
deal with me like a human being

02:17.470 --> 02:20.181
and put down your script and...

02:27.397 --> 02:30.233
- Oh, good.
You're still here, Rick.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.443
I'd like to offer you

02:31.484 --> 02:33.528
a full-time job
as my office manager.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.864
- Oh, no way.
- Mm-hmm.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.366
- Uh, what are--
what are the hours?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.702
- 9:00 until 1:00.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.830
- Is that 9:00 until 1:00 p.m.
Or--or 1:00 in the morning?

02:43.872 --> 02:48.001
- 9:00 until one of us dies.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.878
- Oh, cool.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.843
<i>You have to realize</i>
<i>that when Angelyne showed up,</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:58.678
<i>L.A. needed her.</i>

02:59.929 --> 03:02.432
I mean, thanks to Reagan
and his cronies,

03:02.474 --> 03:05.060
homelessness was on the rise.

03:05.101 --> 03:08.229
Everyone's getting lung cancer
because of pollution,

03:08.271 --> 03:11.441
and then Angelyne provided
color and humor and--

03:11.483 --> 03:14.611
- And essence, my essence.
- Yeah, and essence.

03:14.652 --> 03:19.324
She--she brightened up
a otherwise grim landscape.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.869
And I do believe
that her hot-pink image was--

03:22.911 --> 03:24.788
it was an escape

03:24.829 --> 03:28.458
for the collective
consciousness of the city.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.834
- Good, good.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.544
Now do it from the top
with the essence part,

03:31.586 --> 03:33.088
but make it natural.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.799
- You have to realize
that when Angelyne showed up,

03:35.840 --> 03:37.425
L.A. needed her.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.599
- Angelyne!

03:46.768 --> 03:48.186
- Angelyne.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.276
- I don't like to
talk about what's next.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.321
I like to talk about now.
Ooh.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.448
- Barbie.
- Hey, sweetie.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.909
- Are you Barbie?

04:10.834 --> 04:13.461
- Angelyne! Hey!
You want to go out with me?

04:13.503 --> 04:17.590
- Mm-mm.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.012
- I don't know, but obviously
she's doing something right

04:22.053 --> 04:23.805
because she's up there
and we're down here.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.269
- This is great.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.907
Oh, wow.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.660
I've never seen
anything like this.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.829
- Looking good.

04:47.871 --> 04:52.375
Here she comes!
Whoo!

04:52.417 --> 04:55.837
- The lady of the hour.
Here we go.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.883
- I knew she'd like it.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.760
- So?

05:01.801 --> 05:05.055
- Truly magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.015
- I sure hope
this 22 grand pays off.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.975
- It's always
money, money, money.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.729
You got to be
in the now, now, now, honey.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.982
I bet people will talk
about this 100 years from now.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.736
- Like this?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.529
- That's beautiful.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.366
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.575
- It's working.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.136
- Holy shit.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.144
<i>- Here, I thought she peaked</i>
<i>back with the billboards.</i>

05:53.186 --> 05:54.771
<i>Boy, was I wrong.</i>

05:54.813 --> 05:57.941
<i>Just talked to a guy who flew</i>
<i>all the way out from Sweden</i>

05:57.982 --> 05:59.859
<i>for a lunch date with her.</i>

05:59.901 --> 06:02.195
<i>- Her allure is wild.</i>

06:02.237 --> 06:05.323
<i>- Lucky of you,</i>
<i>she's here today.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:08.451
<i>- Should I go get her now?</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:10.870
<i>All right, come on.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

06:10.912 --> 06:12.247
- Coming here?
- I think he's coming here.

06:12.288 --> 06:15.583
- Oh, God, okay.
Um, shoes.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.378
Shoes, shoes.
Left, right.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.714
<i>- This is the kind of crowd</i>
<i>Angelyne brings.</i>

06:20.755 --> 06:23.091
- Done.
<i>- Bobby, Sue.</i>

06:23.133 --> 06:24.759
- Oh, you know,
I'm gonna be on the TV.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.969
Help me.
- Yeah, let me get...

06:26.011 --> 06:28.388
- Get the pillow.
Quick, quick.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.931
- Okay.
Where do you want me?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.767
- Um, on the couch
like you're watching.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.603
- Okay, teeth.
Pull your skirt down.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.771
- Good?
- Have a good show.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.733
- My God, it's Angelyne.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.402
I have been trying to get you
on the show for years,

06:42.444 --> 06:46.239
and now you have this
ten-story wall in Hollywood.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.575
It's so big.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.786
- Well, I just really
like things big, Russell.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.831
- Whoa, we're on TV here.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.917
Angelyne, we're just
dying to know about you.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.170
Do you promise
to open up to us?

07:01.629 --> 07:05.133
Only if you open up
to me first.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.968
- Honey, come look,
Angelyne's on.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.678
<i>- Do you ever get tired</i>
<i>of the attention?</i>

07:08.720 --> 07:11.139
<i>- No, I have</i>
<i>an insatiable appetite</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:12.807
<i>for three things...</i>

07:12.849 --> 07:14.684
- I bought her
those sunglasses.

07:14.726 --> 07:19.314
<i>- First, attention.</i>
<i>Second, teasing.</i>

07:19.356 --> 07:21.649
<i>Third, money.</i>

07:21.691 --> 07:23.818
<i>Isn't money adorable?</i>

07:23.860 --> 07:27.572
<i>It's so green a pretty.</i>
<i>- It is.</i>

07:27.614 --> 07:29.491
<i>So how many billboards do you</i>
<i>actually have right now?</i>

07:29.532 --> 07:31.034
- Isn't this
that lady you know?

07:31.076 --> 07:33.745
<i>- 193 billboards.</i>
- Aah!

07:33.787 --> 07:35.872
<i>- But what everybody's</i>
<i>dying to know is,</i>

07:35.914 --> 07:38.958
<i>what exactly do you do?</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.378
- I make boys horny.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.338
- The rest of us
work for a living.

07:43.380 --> 07:47.050
Is there anything more to you?

07:47.092 --> 07:49.177
- There's so much suffering
in the world,

07:49.219 --> 07:51.221
and I am a divine...

07:51.262 --> 07:54.599
sex goddess presence
for people to discover

07:54.641 --> 07:57.519
and relate to.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.020
And then they pay me.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.773
- At 2,300 an hour
for an appearance.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.527
- It's up to 2,400 now,
thanks to you.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.237
- Now we know that you're busy

08:07.278 --> 08:10.615
doing whatever it is
you do exactly,

08:10.657 --> 08:12.659
but...

08:12.701 --> 08:14.869
is Angelyne at her peak?

08:14.911 --> 08:19.290
- I'll be peaking...soon.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.919
I bet you will.

08:22.961 --> 08:27.173
- It's all about the tease
with men.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.051
Men like to make women
feel powerless,

08:30.093 --> 08:34.222
and teasing is how we get
the power back.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.891
<i>So that's exactly what I did</i>
<i>with Hugh Hefner.</i>

08:36.933 --> 08:40.228
- Angelyne, please take a seat.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.813
Make yourself at home.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.568
You know, you have a...

08:46.609 --> 08:49.404
real Marilyn quality about you.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.197
You know, she was on the cover

08:51.239 --> 08:54.451
of our first issue
we did in '53, you know?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.577
- Oh, I know.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.246
Marilyn is my art mother
of sorts.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.539
- Well, I bet she is.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.791
- I also know
that she never gave you consent

09:01.833 --> 09:03.543
to use her photos.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.088
You bought them from another
man who paid her pennies

09:07.130 --> 09:09.090
to take them
several years earlier

09:09.132 --> 09:11.301
because she needed to make
her car payment.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.928
And then you used them
to launch your empire.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.014
And voilà!
Ah.

09:16.056 --> 09:20.935
You are a multimillionaire,
and she's dead.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.480
But I'm rambling.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.190
You know all this.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.733
- Mm.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.693
- What's your pitch, Hugh?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.154
Why do you have
such a hard-on to meet me?

09:31.196 --> 09:36.034
- You have your billboards,
but I know there's more.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.955
Tell me more.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.584
Who is the real Angelyne?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.795
That's the story I want.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.548
- Don't you love
the not knowing?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.635
The desperate energy...

09:53.677 --> 09:55.804
As it builds up inside of you

09:55.845 --> 09:58.640
as you wonder,
as it drives you mad?

09:58.682 --> 10:01.643
That way...

10:01.685 --> 10:03.853
I can be whoever...

10:03.895 --> 10:06.147
whatever...

10:06.189 --> 10:08.942
however...

10:08.983 --> 10:11.903
you want me to be.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.531
- You know,
one of our photographers

10:14.572 --> 10:18.702
suggested you for our
"celebrity of the year" issue?

10:18.743 --> 10:22.580
She said that you have more
sex appeal with your clothes on

10:22.622 --> 10:25.583
than all the other girls she
shot with their clothes off.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.128
- That is so sweet.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.629
You should tell
your photographer

10:29.671 --> 10:32.048
to join my fan club.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.301
- But I'm not interested
in those photos of you.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.853
- I thought it was made clear

10:44.894 --> 10:47.022
I would never pose
with my clothes off?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.858
- It was made abundantly clear,
Angelyne.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.152
- You know,
millions of girls dream

10:52.193 --> 10:54.487
of an opportunity like this.

10:54.529 --> 10:58.575
- That's cute,
but I'm not millions of girls.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.453
See, I don't need this.
- Oh.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.374
- I have 200 billboards
all over Los Angeles...

11:06.416 --> 11:10.086
but I'd love to find a way
to help you out.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.882
Maybe I can license you

11:13.923 --> 11:15.592
a few of the photos
that Freddy took.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.927
Perhaps you commission Rick
to write the article.

11:17.969 --> 11:21.389
Otherwise I'm struggling to see

11:21.431 --> 11:24.059
what's in it for me.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.187
- I'm offering advice on
how to maximize your potential.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.938
- It sounds like
you're trying to get me

11:28.980 --> 11:31.358
to take my clothes off
and give you my story

11:31.399 --> 11:34.944
so you can sell more copies
of your magazine.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.489
If you want the story
of my life...

11:41.618 --> 11:43.453
It's on a wall

11:43.495 --> 11:46.831
at the corner
of Hollywood and Vine.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.669
It's hard to miss.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.755
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Hugh.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.384
Ta-ta.
Let's go, boys.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.969
<i>- I didn't know who the hell</i>
<i>I was when I first met her.</i>

12:00.011 --> 12:03.598
All I saw was
this badass rebel queen

12:03.640 --> 12:05.975
who didn't give a fuck about
what she was supposed to do

12:06.017 --> 12:09.646
with her life,
her body, her sexuality.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.148
She just put it all out there
for the world to see.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.818
- You're a rebel, Angelyne.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.279
Telling Hugh Hefner no?
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.321 --> 12:22.283
- I would've paid good money
to see the look on his face.

12:22.325 --> 12:26.162
- To be honest, his face never
actually changed its expression

12:26.204 --> 12:30.458
beyond a general smugness.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.004
I'm proud of you, Angelyne.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.052
- Harold?
- Yeah.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.143
- You know anything about...
foot fetishes?

12:48.184 --> 12:50.562
- I can't say I do.
Why do you ask?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.397
- We have this German fan.

12:52.439 --> 12:56.860
He's asking for something...
more personal.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.778
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.447
So what,
does he want your shoes?

13:00.488 --> 13:02.490
- No, I already sent him
some heels,

13:02.532 --> 13:03.950
but now he wants a video.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.869
- Well, as long as
you're not doing anything

13:05.910 --> 13:07.704
that makes you
feel uncomfortable,

13:07.746 --> 13:09.831
then I can't see the harm.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.335
Just be careful.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.170
The--the more
you put out there,

13:15.211 --> 13:17.005
the more people
are gonna want to get

13:17.047 --> 13:18.506
something from you, you know?

13:37.192 --> 13:39.235
I am too delicate
for this heat.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.571
Speak quickly, I've got lunch
with Allee in 10 minutes,

13:41.613 --> 13:43.323
and I'm already
30 minutes late.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.824
- Uh, we just got a call.
This is big.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.327
I mean, this is actually, like,
bigger than big.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.497
Julien Temple called.
- Give me context, Rick.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.665
You can't just assume I know
who you're talking about.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.042
I meet a lot of people.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.419
- Directed, uh, "The Great
Rock 'n' Roll Swindle,"

13:56.461 --> 13:59.255
"Absolute Beginners,"
and now he wants you

13:59.297 --> 14:03.843
to star in his next movie,
"Earth Girls are Easy."

14:03.885 --> 14:06.137
- Oh, my God.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.181
- He said, and I quote,

14:08.223 --> 14:10.892
"Angelyne is like
Greek mythology."

14:10.934 --> 14:14.396
- Oh, this is huge.
- Totally.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.398
- I won't audition.
I'm done with that.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.316
And I will only play myself.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.735
- Yes, must be billed
as Angelyne.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.529
- Yes.
What else?

14:22.570 --> 14:24.948
- Oh, in a happy bit
of symbiosis,

14:24.989 --> 14:27.450
"Los Angeles" magazine wants
to send a journalist

14:27.492 --> 14:28.993
to do a feature profile on you.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.080
- Maybe we are saying "yes"
to too many things.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.541
Life is a big negotiation--

14:34.582 --> 14:36.376
buying a car,
freeing a hostage,

14:36.418 --> 14:37.544
running for president,

14:37.585 --> 14:39.546
agreeing to a feature
in a magazine.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.047
Rather than just saying "yes,"

14:41.089 --> 14:42.549
you keep
the other side talking,

14:42.590 --> 14:44.718
and eventually
they will reveal to you

14:44.759 --> 14:47.512
what it is they actually want,
and once you know that,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.306
you have the power
to get what you want

14:50.348 --> 14:54.102
or what we want,
which should be what I want.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.937
- Which is what we all want.

14:55.979 --> 15:00.442
Uh, next, although I do
vehemently disagree on this,

15:00.483 --> 15:02.569
I did as you requested
and turned down Oprah.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.070
- Thank God.
Planes are...

15:04.112 --> 15:05.905
Too claustrophobic.

15:05.947 --> 15:09.576
- But we do actually have
an interesting offer,

15:09.617 --> 15:12.412
and these people have
zero interest in your past--

15:12.454 --> 15:14.914
"Hot Seat" with Wally George.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.583
- Ugh.
Ew, fuck that guy.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.585
- Language.
- Who is Wally George?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.420
- He's a very popular,
very colorful,

15:20.462 --> 15:23.631
very conservative talk show
host down in Orange County.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.008
- Yeah, that's one way
to put it.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.593
- Yeah, he's controversial,

15:26.634 --> 15:28.928
but that is nothing
that Angelyne can't handle.

15:28.970 --> 15:32.766
And besides, we are looking for
platforms for her music video.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.517
- Well, I'm sure Oprah would've
played the music video.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.436
- Oprah digs
into people's pasts

15:36.478 --> 15:37.979
and makes them cry
on her couch.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.773
I don't need that.
- You're missing the point--

15:39.814 --> 15:42.192
- Maybe you're missing
the point?

15:42.233 --> 15:45.028
Don't you think so, Rick?
Freddy?

15:45.070 --> 15:47.614
You see?

15:47.655 --> 15:51.284
That is what your negative
energy does, okay?

15:51.326 --> 15:53.119
I need to get the video
out there.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.663
Let's book it.
- Booked.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.749
- Okay, here.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.755
This is to Fritz in Germany.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.299
- Is it hot in here?
Is that fan still broken?

16:06.341 --> 16:08.760
It feels hot.
Can we--can we open a window?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.762
- Would you open
a goddamn window, please?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.640
- Coming.
- This is to Dennis in Sweden.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.728
No, don't open the window.
It's 100 degrees out.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.147
- Please, close
the goddamn window, Andre.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.649
- C-can you give me a moment?

16:38.915 --> 16:41.001
Ooh.
I'm back.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.794
Where were we?

16:42.836 --> 16:43.920
<i>- Are you ready?</i>

16:43.962 --> 16:46.297
<i>Here he is--</i>

16:46.339 --> 16:48.216
<i>that hard-hitting,</i>
<i>award-winning</i>

16:48.258 --> 16:50.010
<i>conservative voice</i>
<i>of television,</i>

16:50.051 --> 16:52.512
<i>Wally George.</i>

16:52.554 --> 16:55.390
Wally! Wally! Wally!

16:55.432 --> 16:58.601
- Oh, Wally George?
Oh, I'll never forget that.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.812
It was like
a goddamn lion's den.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.275
Fucking Orange County, man.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.444
- I took it
as a big middle finger

17:07.485 --> 17:09.821
to the queer community
that embraced her.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.115
Spend five minutes watching
videos of Wally George

17:12.157 --> 17:14.868
on YouTube, you'll know
exactly what I'm talking about.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.411
But that's Angelyne.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.538
Anything
to sell another T-shirt.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.375
- Welcome back, everybody,
and our guest is Angelyne,

17:22.417 --> 17:25.378
who is famous
for absolutely nothing!

17:25.420 --> 17:28.048
- Nothing!

17:28.089 --> 17:30.300
I think you're gonna fall
out of that dress any second.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.721
Now, listen, Angelyne,

17:34.763 --> 17:36.723
I'm gonna ask you
something serious.

17:36.765 --> 17:40.518
I-I mean, don't you feel
a little self-conscious

17:40.560 --> 17:42.645
dressed in that kind
of a revealing outfit?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.397
- No.
No.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.524
- I think you should be
a little more modest.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.235
Don't you think so?
No!

17:49.277 --> 17:52.572
- I would like to see Angelyne
with a little more modesty.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.699
I think Angelyne
would look a lot better

17:54.741 --> 17:56.743
in a--in a turtleneck sweater,
don't you?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.578
No!

17:58.620 --> 17:59.996
- Do you have the feeling...

18:00.038 --> 18:02.290
Do you have the feeling
she might be a bimbo?

18:02.332 --> 18:05.585
Yeah!

18:05.627 --> 18:06.961
- We have some guys
in the audience

18:07.003 --> 18:08.713
who are dying
to ask you a question.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.257
Will you consent
to answer some questions?

18:11.299 --> 18:13.259
- Well, if they're dying,
of course.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.886
Ooh.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.680
- Okay, number one,
your name and your question.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.223
Go ahead.
- Uh, my name's Phil.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.809
- Yes, they're real.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.227
- Are you gonna do this
until they won't let you

18:22.268 --> 18:24.270
do it any more, until you
have too many wrinkles or...

18:25.772 --> 18:27.649
- Wrinkles are darling.
I don't know.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.734
- I wonder if you ever
considered settling down

18:29.776 --> 18:31.945
and, uh, raising a family
or being married

18:31.986 --> 18:33.613
or if you're gonna do this
for the rest of your life?

18:33.655 --> 18:35.740
- Will you ever settle down
and have kiddies?

18:35.782 --> 18:36.950
- No.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.660
- Would you approve
of your kids doing this?

18:38.702 --> 18:40.161
- Pardon me?
- Would you approve

18:40.203 --> 18:41.705
of your kids doing the same
thing that you're doing now?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.456
- You don't really know
what I do.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.791
You don't really know who I am.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.252
I could be extraterrestrial,
for all you know.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.800
- I understand--Hold it.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.053
I understand that you
have made a rock video.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.765
Here it is, Angelyne's video.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.302
- I'm so sorry.
I should've--

19:37.344 --> 19:41.181
- Freddy and I...

19:41.222 --> 19:45.310
have been filming some
really incredible material.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.735
You should find someone
to release it

19:53.777 --> 19:57.822
and make a documentary of me.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.201
And I have an idea
for a magazine

20:01.242 --> 20:03.745
called "Hot Pink,"

20:03.787 --> 20:06.331
where my fans can contribute.

20:08.583 --> 20:13.380
They already send me
so much wonderful love...

20:13.421 --> 20:17.467
and I-I want to be able
to share that with the world.

20:20.011 --> 20:23.348
<i>- Hollywood is</i>
<i>a 24-hour-a-day movie,</i>

20:23.390 --> 20:26.434
<i>and a lot of times,</i>
<i>you don't even realize</i>

20:26.476 --> 20:29.979
that what's going on
is a movie or a TV show.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.064
It's...

20:31.106 --> 20:34.442
Our field of vision
is so small.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.778
Like, I remember one time,

20:36.820 --> 20:41.616
I saw a man jump off a building
on my block,

20:41.658 --> 20:44.244
and I ran
as fast as I could to help.

20:44.285 --> 20:48.081
And what do I see?

20:48.123 --> 20:51.418
There's a giant airbag
and hundreds of crew,

20:51.459 --> 20:53.586
cameras, the whole ordeal.

20:53.628 --> 20:57.507
I mean, that's Hollywood.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.302
It's a fun place.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.097
It's also a dangerous place.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.187
- I think that might be
one of them now.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.064
- Are you sure?
- Not really.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.026
- Good enough for me.
- How was that?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.861
- That was Oscar worthy,
but we got to go,

21:17.902 --> 21:20.071
like, 30 minutes ago.
- Don't tell me what to do.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.032
- The writer
from the "Los Angeles" magazine

21:22.073 --> 21:24.200
is probably there right now.
- I'll be ready when I'm ready.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.744
- They have
makeup people there.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.163
- Those people don't know
what they're doing.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.503
I am here for a reason.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.464
The universe supports me.

21:37.505 --> 21:41.217
I'm not confined by the
limitations of this dimension.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.432
No one affects me.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.142
I do the affecting.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.643
- What?

21:50.685 --> 21:52.729
- Why can't I just write
my own lines?

21:52.771 --> 21:54.105
I don't talk like that.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.523
- 'Cause you're not
in the union.

21:55.565 --> 21:59.694
It's a Writers Guild thing.
We have to go right now.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.782
Yes, can I help you?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.867
- Yes, um,
I'm looking for Rachel.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.410
- There's no Rachel here.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.454
I think, uh, you've got
the wrong address.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.955
- Wait.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.227
Danny.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.978
- Rachel.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.231
- I don't know anybody
by that name.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.403
Who else are you talking to?

22:42.195 --> 22:44.572
- Wow. Sorry.
I can't stop staring.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.116
I just--I just can't believe

22:46.157 --> 22:49.077
we're sitting
across from each other.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.037
My parents aren't gonna
believe it either.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.373
I saw your painting on the news

22:53.415 --> 22:56.251
when I was in Morocco--
long story--

22:56.292 --> 22:58.795
and I, uh--I recognized you
immediately.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.130
Even with your whole new look,

23:00.171 --> 23:02.465
I just knew right away
that it was you.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.429
- Why are you here?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.684
- Uh, well, you know...

23:12.726 --> 23:15.020
I, uh--I brought some stuff

23:15.061 --> 23:18.565
that I thought
you might...want

23:18.606 --> 23:22.027
that you left behind.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.697
Also, just came
to say hi and...

23:25.739 --> 23:27.198
congratulations.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.868
- Are you talking to the press?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.162
- No.
No, no, no, no.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.874
That--that's not
what this is about.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.669
Because if you are...

23:44.382 --> 23:46.551
I need to know.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.224
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, I'm--

23:53.266 --> 23:57.270
- You can't be a part of this.
- I can't be a part of what?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.986
I think I'm a little lost here.

24:05.028 --> 24:07.072
I truly just came here
out of love.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.283
Just a simple hello,
and I have your old passports,

24:10.325 --> 24:12.869
some old high-school photos
that I took, your--

24:12.911 --> 24:14.245
our wedding photos.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.831
- I don't want any of that.
That's not...

24:23.880 --> 24:26.675
That's not...

24:26.716 --> 24:28.718
Angelyne.

24:34.474 --> 24:38.478
- No, but it--
it is you, Rachel.

24:44.859 --> 24:47.445
- I-it's time for you to leave.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.122
- Will you at least acknowledge
what we had together

24:57.163 --> 24:59.124
so I know I'm not crazy?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.960
- There is nothing
to acknowledge

25:02.002 --> 25:05.422
because that
is not a part of me.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.967
- But it is a part of me.

25:09.009 --> 25:13.430
- This isn't about you.
This is my story.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.141
- This is my story, too.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.936
You are a big part
of my story.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.731
You can't just erase people
like that.

25:22.772 --> 25:25.608
- I can do whatever I want.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.527
You don't exist.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.237
- Excuse--

25:42.500 --> 25:45.003
- What a weirdo.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.597
You share these...

25:55.638 --> 25:59.100
incredibly intimate moments
with someone you loved,

25:59.142 --> 26:03.146
and they're able to look you
in the eye years later

26:03.188 --> 26:06.691
and say that
none of it mattered?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.943
You don't matter?

26:08.985 --> 26:11.112
It doesn't exist?

26:14.616 --> 26:16.701
It hurts.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.621
- The truth is...

26:19.662 --> 26:24.084
I have always been Angelyne.

26:26.961 --> 26:30.131
And that's the only story
you need to know.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.946
- I think Angelyne is here.

27:03.206 --> 27:05.625
Ma'am, you okay?

27:05.667 --> 27:07.043
- What are you doing?

27:10.130 --> 27:11.589
Angelyne.

27:19.222 --> 27:22.517
We're right this way.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.644
So the guy from "L.A." magazine

27:24.686 --> 27:26.938
wants to do your interview
between your two scenes.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.774
Is that okay with you?
- Mm-hmm.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.571
- Is Rick still coming?

27:34.612 --> 27:36.281
- Mm-hmm.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.452
- This is your trailer.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.454
Everything's set up
just the way you like it.

27:45.707 --> 27:48.168
- What is this?
What is this?

27:48.209 --> 27:51.254
- So, since the character in
the script is named Gas Girl,

27:51.296 --> 27:52.964
someone from production
credited you as such,

27:53.006 --> 27:54.382
but we're going to fix it.

27:54.424 --> 27:56.384
- It was made clear
that the only part I will play

27:56.426 --> 27:58.261
is Angelyne,
not Gas Girl, not--

27:58.303 --> 28:00.555
<i>- Eyes on gas girl?</i>
<i>Is she on set?</i>

28:00.597 --> 28:03.433
- I'm Angelyne.
- Right.

28:03.475 --> 28:06.353
A-and what I'm saying is,
it wasn't written for you.

28:06.394 --> 28:08.396
It's a character
at a gas station.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.940
- I don't care what you think.
Fix it.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.692
Or I will find somebody
who will.

28:15.612 --> 28:17.739
- Yeah. No.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.616
It's a two-second cameo,
for fuck's sake.

28:19.657 --> 28:20.950
No one cares,

28:20.992 --> 28:23.203
not about the credit
and certainly not about you.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.830
I don't.
I'm out.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.916
- Nobody quits me.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.685
- I did care about her.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.520
I do.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.775
She would say, "Life is pain,
and everyone is suffering.

28:53.817 --> 28:57.904
And the sooner you can
get out of it, the better."

28:57.946 --> 29:01.991
Her positivity was her way
of coping with that darkness.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.661
- I'm not a woman.

29:04.703 --> 29:08.123
I'm an icon.

29:08.164 --> 29:11.334
I'm not a woman.

29:11.376 --> 29:14.337
I'm an icon.

29:14.379 --> 29:17.799
I'm not a woman.

29:17.841 --> 29:20.719
I'm an icon.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.262
I'm not a woman.

29:22.303 --> 29:25.682
I'm an icon.

29:25.724 --> 29:27.851
I'm Angelyne.

29:31.563 --> 29:34.315
<i>What's the one thing</i>
<i>that you know, hmm?</i>

29:34.357 --> 29:37.068
<i>It's how you feel.</i>

29:37.110 --> 29:40.905
<i>If you're frightened,</i>
<i>you want to leave.</i>

29:40.947 --> 29:44.951
<i>If you love it,</i>
<i>you want to stay.</i>

29:46.411 --> 29:49.789
<i>My quest is</i>
<i>to feel good all the time,</i>

29:49.831 --> 29:53.835
<i>but it can be challenging</i>
<i>in this reality.</i>

29:53.877 --> 29:58.340
<i>I have no respect for what</i>
<i>this reality does to people.</i>

29:58.381 --> 30:01.343
<i>So I evolved.</i>

30:01.384 --> 30:05.930
<i>I left my body</i>
<i>and became pure energy.</i>

30:05.972 --> 30:08.516
<i>It was so warm and loving.</i>

30:08.558 --> 30:12.520
<i>It was pure good, all light.</i>

30:12.562 --> 30:14.773
- Like a, um,
out-of-body experience?

30:14.814 --> 30:17.025
- Mm, I've been trying
to go back ever since.

30:17.067 --> 30:19.194
Earth is...

30:19.235 --> 30:21.863
like a bus bench
for cosmic bums,

30:21.905 --> 30:23.323
but the bus never comes.

30:23.365 --> 30:26.701
We're all trapped
in this awful terrarium,

30:26.743 --> 30:30.455
but there are seams where
the positivity can get through

30:30.497 --> 30:33.166
and help you connect
to what it is you truly want.

30:39.589 --> 30:43.218
- What kind of a kid were you?
- Sad, lonely.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.260
- Why?

30:44.302 --> 30:45.804
- Well, Back in Ohio,

30:45.845 --> 30:48.431
I lost my parents
at a young age.

30:48.473 --> 30:51.309
It made me look for attention
with my tricks.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.395
I said, "Well...

30:53.436 --> 30:56.940
I'm going to get the love
of the world."

30:56.981 --> 31:00.777
- And how old were you
when they passed away?

31:00.819 --> 31:03.697
- Five and under.

31:03.738 --> 31:05.281
- Five or under?

31:07.283 --> 31:10.412
- This is me, my band.

31:10.453 --> 31:13.081
- Right.
"Kiss Me L.A.," right?

31:13.123 --> 31:14.749
Yeah, I know this one.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.334
I want to go
back to your parents.

31:16.376 --> 31:17.752
So back in Ohio--

31:17.794 --> 31:21.756
- You know what's so special
about this song?

31:21.798 --> 31:24.134
- What?
- It only has two lyrics.

31:24.175 --> 31:25.677
Do you know what they are?
- Mm-mm.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.554
- I thought you were a fan.
- No, I am a fan.

31:27.595 --> 31:28.722
I just didn't know that--

31:28.763 --> 31:30.557
- "You know
I'm getting off on you"

31:30.598 --> 31:32.100
and "kiss me, L.A.."

31:32.142 --> 31:33.685
- "Kiss me, L.A.," yeah.
Right.

31:33.727 --> 31:36.229
- And all my music
has been inspired by aliens.

31:36.271 --> 31:38.398
- Let's go back to something
you said a moment ago

31:38.440 --> 31:40.442
in regards to your parents--

31:42.277 --> 31:44.529
See? Two lyrics.

31:46.072 --> 31:49.826
Let them wash over you
like a mantra.

31:49.868 --> 31:51.953
- Angelyne, you've got to give
me something here. please.

31:51.995 --> 31:55.665
- I'm trying to give you
inner peace.

31:55.707 --> 31:57.959
- She called me
spiritually constipated

31:58.001 --> 32:01.087
and dragged me
to a tchotchke shop.

32:01.129 --> 32:04.799
- It would take us weeks
to unblock all of that.

32:04.841 --> 32:08.261
- Then I'm going to need
something extra for protection.

32:08.303 --> 32:11.931
- Protection from something
in particular, doll?

32:11.973 --> 32:15.810
- Negativity, "intrusivity"...
- Hmm.

32:15.852 --> 32:19.397
- Prying eyes.
- Mm.

32:19.439 --> 32:20.774
- Hmm.

32:20.815 --> 32:24.152
- This one will combat
fixation and sorcery.

32:24.194 --> 32:26.946
- Hmm.

32:26.988 --> 32:30.367
- This one keeps people
from fucking with your head.

32:30.408 --> 32:33.578
- Thank you, mommy, and him?

32:33.620 --> 32:35.789
What do you think, uh...

32:35.830 --> 32:37.582
rose quartz?
- Mm.

32:37.624 --> 32:42.045
- Mm-hmm.
It's by the intention pouches.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.509
- So how long have
y'all known each other for?

32:47.550 --> 32:49.678
- 1,000 lifetimes,

32:49.719 --> 32:51.471
since she was a queen
in ancient Egypt.

32:51.513 --> 32:53.640
- A long time before Idaho.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.603
- Well, which is it, Angelyne,
Ohio or Idaho?

33:02.065 --> 33:03.775
If you won't let
other people talk to me,

33:03.817 --> 33:05.610
then you have to talk to me.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.654
Tell me where you grew up.
When did you move to L.A.?

33:07.696 --> 33:10.699
- You are completely missing
the point of who I am.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.410
It is the essence,
the inspiration,

33:13.451 --> 33:14.869
and that is
what I am giving you.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.830
- I need more than essence
and inspiration, okay?

33:16.871 --> 33:20.625
I need a story that I can print
in "The Hollywood Reporter."

33:20.667 --> 33:21.876
Okay, you know what?

33:21.918 --> 33:23.795
I don't think
this is gonna work out.

33:23.837 --> 33:26.047
I'm sorry. Good luck
with your Indiegogo campaign.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.465
It was nice to meet you.

33:30.343 --> 33:31.636
Okay.

33:33.346 --> 33:34.764
- Wait.

33:40.311 --> 33:42.647
What if I...

33:44.858 --> 33:49.070
Show you something
I've never show anybody before?

33:53.950 --> 33:58.163
A seam in the cosmic structure
of the universe.

34:16.848 --> 34:20.018
- You know,
you could've told me.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.603
My clothes?

34:23.313 --> 34:25.690
- Sweetie, this is my show.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.817
Nobody's looking at you.

34:45.794 --> 34:48.004
- Angelyne.
- Hi.

34:50.799 --> 34:54.219
- Angelyne, you're an icon.

34:58.973 --> 35:01.559
- Darling, everyone's waiting.

35:14.114 --> 35:16.616
<i>One...</i>

35:16.658 --> 35:19.452
<i>two...</i>

35:19.494 --> 35:23.623
<i>three...</i>

35:23.665 --> 35:27.127

35:41.349 --> 35:44.477
<i>nine...</i>

35:44.519 --> 35:45.937
<i>materialize.</i>

35:45.979 --> 35:48.940
<i>Cosma Shiva!</i>
<i>Galaxina!</i>

35:48.982 --> 35:50.984
<i>In any case, we are in space.</i>

35:51.026 --> 35:52.944
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>we are in space.</i>

35:52.986 --> 35:54.821
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>we are in space.</i>

35:54.863 --> 35:57.449
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>we are in space.</i>

36:08.585 --> 36:12.213
<i>Cosma Shiva!</i>
<i>Galaxina!</i>

36:12.255 --> 36:16.092
<i>Cosma Shiva!</i>
<i>Galaxina!</i>

36:47.374 --> 36:50.377
<i>Cosma Shiva!</i>
<i>Galaxina!</i>

36:50.418 --> 36:52.045
- Ooh.

36:52.087 --> 36:55.131
<i>Cosma Shiva!</i>
<i>Galaxina!</i>

37:06.768 --> 37:08.978
- In that moment...

37:09.020 --> 37:11.564
in that light,

37:11.606 --> 37:14.651
I saw her the way
that she wanted me to see her.

37:14.693 --> 37:18.947
- He wanted to understand
who I am,

37:18.988 --> 37:21.449
but he didn't ask
any good questions.

37:21.491 --> 37:24.828
This is who I am.
I engage with people.

37:24.869 --> 37:28.164
I take them to a higher plane.

37:40.260 --> 37:43.096
- Having fun?
- It's a party.

37:43.138 --> 37:47.100
- So when does this publish?

37:47.142 --> 37:48.893
- I'm not sure
this will publish.

37:48.935 --> 37:52.355
- You have to.
I need my billboard.

37:52.397 --> 37:54.607
- I honestly don't know how to
describe what happened today.

37:54.649 --> 37:55.859
I really don't.

37:59.988 --> 38:04.617
- I know that you love me...

38:04.659 --> 38:07.579
and you do not...

38:07.620 --> 38:09.706
want to hurt me.

38:16.546 --> 38:19.215
- I guess I'll try
to think of something.

38:20.592 --> 38:23.261
- What you see...

38:23.303 --> 38:25.472
here...

38:25.513 --> 38:28.808
is everything
you need to know about me.

38:28.850 --> 38:31.394
All you need...

38:31.436 --> 38:33.646
is now.

38:33.688 --> 38:36.274
Now.

38:36.316 --> 38:37.650
Now.

38:43.990 --> 38:45.700
<i>- Did I get the truth</i>
<i>about her?</i>

38:45.742 --> 38:47.369
<i>No, but I wanted to help her.</i>

38:47.410 --> 38:50.663
So I wrote a vibe piece,
and I was right.

38:50.705 --> 38:54.668
The article was good for her,
and she got her billboard.

38:54.709 --> 38:56.086
But about two years later,

38:56.127 --> 38:58.338
the truth magically
did fall in my lap.

39:11.768 --> 39:14.437
<i>He said he worked</i>
<i>at a government agency.</i>

39:14.479 --> 39:16.606
<i>He said he was</i>
<i>a hobby genealogist,</i>

39:16.648 --> 39:18.191
<i>but I can't tell you</i>
<i>who it is.</i>

39:18.233 --> 39:20.151
<i>I don't reveal my sources.</i>

39:20.193 --> 39:23.780
Hi, I'm Jeff Glaser.

39:23.822 --> 39:26.700
I think you, uh, emailed me.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.508
Holy shit.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.813
- Rachel.

39:56.855 --> 39:58.481
Actually,
"The Hollywood Reporter"

39:58.523 --> 40:00.108
wasn't even the first
to figure out

40:00.150 --> 40:02.485
the whole truth
about Angelyne's past.

40:02.527 --> 40:04.654
This college kid
cracked the whole case

40:04.696 --> 40:06.197
wide open
well before Jeff.

40:06.239 --> 40:07.657
- My name is Max Allen,

40:07.699 --> 40:10.577
and I started making
a documentary about Angelyne

40:10.618 --> 40:12.120
in 2012.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.748
And as far as I know,
I was the first person

40:14.789 --> 40:18.960
to discover the whole truth
about Angelyne, so...

40:19.002 --> 40:22.714
Yeah, I guess you could say
I learned a lot.

40:22.756 --> 40:24.799
One thing I learned was
that Angelyne doesn't think

40:24.841 --> 40:27.552
in the traditional
beginning, middle, and end.

40:27.594 --> 40:30.722
You ask her,
she was always going up.

40:30.764 --> 40:34.851
There was never a peak,
certainly never a down period,

40:34.893 --> 40:37.937
but that's simply not true.
