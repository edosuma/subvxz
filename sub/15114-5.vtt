00:01.921 --> 00:03.825
<i>Your disease.</i>
What are you doing about it?

00:03.828 --> 00:06.038
Regular examinations,
calibrated meds.

00:06.072 --> 00:07.546
You appear free from
physical symptoms,

00:07.580 --> 00:10.088
but I'm far more concerned
about mental decline,

00:10.122 --> 00:12.465
- <i>hallucinations.</i>
- Boss.

00:12.499 --> 00:15.107
- His name is Chad Langley.
- You're sure he's the one?

00:15.141 --> 00:17.180
The high-powered rifle
in the trunk of his car

00:17.215 --> 00:18.987
matches the bullet
that struck your wife.

00:19.022 --> 00:22.534
- When can I see you?
- You shouldn't-- not worth the risk.

00:22.568 --> 00:24.940
- You don't want to hear this.
- Kitty O'Neill's joined the Walsh camp.

00:24.975 --> 00:27.215
- Campaign managing?
- Cut the bullshit, Kitty.

00:27.249 --> 00:29.524
- Town hall at UIC.
- Pass.

00:29.558 --> 00:32.601
<i>I know, by the way,
about you and Ben.</i>

00:32.636 --> 00:35.342
- Town hall, Evanston.
- Fine.

00:38.286 --> 00:39.958
Oh, I love you.

00:39.992 --> 00:41.398
Is that your wife
in the picture?

00:41.432 --> 00:43.369
Nah, a couple of good-time
girls, that's all.

00:43.405 --> 00:45.977
<i>We used to have to beat them
off with a stick back then.</i>

00:46.011 --> 00:48.719
I have information that every
media outlet in town wants--

00:48.753 --> 00:51.159
the name of the suspect in the
shooting of Meredith Kane.

00:51.193 --> 00:52.195
Do we have a deal?

00:52.229 --> 00:54.670
Sir, posted online too.

00:54.704 --> 00:56.340
God damn it.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.246
Gentlemen, I wanted to present
this redevelopment plan

00:58.280 --> 01:00.318
in person because of
its tremendous scope.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.428
With all due respect, it's just not
practical to move that quickly.

01:03.462 --> 01:06.334
Natural selection.
We adapt or we die.

01:06.368 --> 01:08.475
Hired some
out-of-state contractor

01:08.509 --> 01:10.581
who's supposed to do it
all on the cheap.

01:10.615 --> 01:12.719
No one man is bigger
than the machine.

01:12.754 --> 01:13.956
It corrects itself.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.895
I haven't set foot here
for over 20 years.

01:15.929 --> 01:17.298
I haven't
protected you.

01:17.332 --> 01:19.906
Don't listen to this shit.
Kane is a goddamn liar.

01:19.940 --> 01:24.250
And when you do come home, the likes
of Kenya Taylor will not be here.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.258
Fuck you, Kane.
You can't change shit!

01:27.292 --> 01:30.634
I'm not done yet.
The thugs-- criminal and financial,

01:30.669 --> 01:32.873
have no idea
what's coming.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.716
Yes.

03:36.751 --> 03:38.384
Expect a number of cases
this morning,

03:38.419 --> 03:40.687
<i>a matter of enforcing laws
already on the books.</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:42.623
At 4:00
in the morning, Tom?

03:42.657 --> 03:44.291
Corruption,
a number of individuals

03:44.325 --> 03:46.860
who have seen fit
to gouge city coffers.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.629
I have no doubt they will
be prosecuted accordingly.

03:49.664 --> 03:53.066
Some level of coordination
usually exists between agencies.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.268
There wasn't time.
Your office is not known for its speed.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.770
Langley's psych evaluation
hasn't been completed.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.005
<i>I'm not prepared to move
forward without it.</i>

04:01.040 --> 04:04.942
Insanity has no bearing
on guilt!

04:09.414 --> 04:12.783
Apparently it's true--
Satan never sleeps.

04:14.953 --> 04:17.855
Oh, great.
I'm gonna sue all your asses!

04:25.632 --> 04:26.765
What?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.200
These arrests--

04:29.702 --> 04:31.670
shouldn't they begin
with you?

04:38.878 --> 04:42.046
I have never benefited
financially from elected office.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.348
But others were
allowed to prosper.

04:44.383 --> 04:46.718
Not with impunity.
Within reason.

04:46.752 --> 04:49.187
And you did
profit, Tom.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.867
<i>Power is a
form of currency.</i>

05:01.902 --> 05:03.836
I've earned
my standing.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.305
You took it,
traded for it--

05:07.139 --> 05:10.209
a favor here,
a blind eye there,

05:10.743 --> 05:12.812
the removal
of obstacles,

05:13.546 --> 05:14.880
of people.

05:15.414 --> 05:17.249
The trouble is,

05:17.283 --> 05:20.252
it doesn't belong
to just you any more--

05:20.886 --> 05:22.888
this house
you've built.

05:22.922 --> 05:26.491
You can't pull cards

05:26.526 --> 05:29.895
and expect it
not to fall.

05:29.929 --> 05:33.598
You are not here.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.238
This is how
it would work:

05:39.322 --> 05:41.757
This only happens when I
want it to happen, okay?

05:41.791 --> 05:44.193
If you can't abide by that,
there's plenty of others who can.

05:44.227 --> 05:45.927
<i>Shell casings have been found...</i>

05:45.962 --> 05:48.463
Great. I'll let you know when I decide
which way I'm gonna go. Thanks.

05:48.497 --> 05:50.365
<i>...A thorough investigation of the scene</i>

05:50.399 --> 05:52.601
<i>and the...
For the shooter.</i>

05:52.635 --> 05:55.236
<i>We will provide you
all the information we can</i>

05:55.271 --> 05:57.072
<i>as it becomes
available.</i>

05:57.106 --> 06:00.041
<i>The early morning arrests
were reported coordinated</i>

06:00.076 --> 06:02.844
by the mayor and the Cook
County State's Attorney,

06:02.879 --> 06:06.214
though no public comment has
been made by either office.

06:06.249 --> 06:08.516
<i>Police have yet
to release the names,</i>

06:08.551 --> 06:11.586
<i>but sources close
to the investigation indicate</i>

06:11.621 --> 06:13.589
<i>those arrested
include ward bosses...</i>

06:13.623 --> 06:16.859
...union leaders and an alderman.

06:16.893 --> 06:18.160
Running late.
Tell me.

06:18.195 --> 06:20.429
Kane's lopping heads--
his own people.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.931
<i>Which wards
are affected?</i>

06:21.965 --> 06:24.032
27nd and 23rd so far.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.601
And it's not even
my birthday.

06:26.635 --> 06:28.304
His timing is
questionable, but--

06:28.338 --> 06:30.039
Kane's above
having reasons.

06:30.073 --> 06:32.208
He does whatever he wants
whenever he wants

06:32.243 --> 06:34.811
and answers to no one,
least of all his candidate.

06:34.846 --> 06:36.613
Honey, I'm leaving.

06:36.648 --> 06:38.615
We should jump in
with a presser

06:38.650 --> 06:40.351
on city ties
to corruption.

06:40.385 --> 06:43.054
No, let's blanket those words
with our volunteers.

06:43.088 --> 06:45.256
Let the news cycle
make the connections for us.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.792
<i>Smart. And if Zajac's
get-out-the-vote</i>

06:47.826 --> 06:49.794
is even a little anemic
as a result,

06:49.829 --> 06:51.496
we'll up
our totals there.

06:51.530 --> 06:53.431
We're gonna win this thing,
aren't we?

06:54.465 --> 06:55.800
Yeah.

06:56.534 --> 06:58.936
My pass at the sweep
for online.

06:59.970 --> 07:00.971
Thank you.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.475
No comment
from dear leader?

07:04.509 --> 07:07.444
No, but I was able to get
a name-- Merc Mercanti.

07:08.747 --> 07:10.080
That's a rough
couple of days--

07:10.115 --> 07:12.083
first he loses his contract
at Lennox Gardens,

07:12.117 --> 07:13.384
<i>then he gets arrested.</i>

07:13.418 --> 07:15.886
Keep trying
with city hall.

07:15.921 --> 07:18.222
Interesting piece
you wrote on Walsh.

07:18.256 --> 07:20.524
It's an article,
not an endorsement.

07:20.559 --> 07:21.859
Exactly.

07:21.894 --> 07:23.961
And you're an editor,
not a reporter.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.068
Traffic?

07:32.102 --> 07:33.736
A little.
Trying to get around it.

07:35.270 --> 07:36.372
Just take Franklin.

07:36.406 --> 07:38.407
Right away.

07:46.748 --> 07:49.116
- What the hell was that?
- Sorry about that.

07:49.151 --> 07:51.285
Stop the car.
Stop now.

08:01.195 --> 08:04.197
Yeah, give me
Commissioner Hardy.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.668
Yeah, there's a pothole

08:07.702 --> 08:10.270
on Chestnut
at Franklin.

08:10.304 --> 08:12.038
I want it fixed today.

08:17.545 --> 08:19.512
They say the measure
of a man

08:19.547 --> 08:22.149
is what he does
with power.

08:22.183 --> 08:23.816
Shut up.

08:27.421 --> 08:28.888
Sorry, Jimmy.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.797
Phones are ringing
off the hook.

08:38.832 --> 08:41.232
It'd be nice to know what our
office isn't commenting on.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.602
He didn't inform me of any
details, only his intentions.

08:43.636 --> 08:45.437
Which seems to have become
synonymous with your own.

08:45.472 --> 08:47.906
Those men have been bleeding
the city dry for years.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.943
He asked them to play ball on
one project, and they didn't.

08:50.977 --> 08:53.212
Was it an impulsive move
on his part?

08:53.246 --> 08:55.814
Maybe, but what he's doing
isn't wrong.

08:55.848 --> 08:58.083
Nor is it effective, given the
fallout that's sure to follow.

08:58.117 --> 09:00.619
Are you questioning
the wisdom of the mayor?

09:00.653 --> 09:02.621
I serve
at his pleasure.

09:02.655 --> 09:03.989
So do I.

09:14.668 --> 09:16.435
Maybe it's
just kids, huh?

09:16.469 --> 09:18.103
Yeah, with fucking
machetes.

09:18.138 --> 09:19.805
They do anything else?

09:23.576 --> 09:25.577
Oh, Jesus Christ.

09:26.579 --> 09:28.947
Plenty of work
here in Indiana.

09:28.982 --> 09:30.482
Fuck.

09:32.852 --> 09:34.486
You all right in here?

09:36.956 --> 09:40.058
Corruption rates, two of
my voter strongholds.

09:45.164 --> 09:46.631
I don't know
why I'm doing this.

09:46.665 --> 09:47.832
Yes, you do.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.501
Nothing is
in my control.

09:50.536 --> 09:51.736
It's him--
everything.

09:51.770 --> 09:53.705
<i>All I can do is react,</i>

09:53.739 --> 09:56.208
go wherever he pushes me,
like a goddamn ball.

09:58.077 --> 10:00.078
Walsh already has
canvassers there.

10:02.181 --> 10:03.615
We'll do the same.

10:03.649 --> 10:06.317
We'll make sure our
organizers stay the course.

10:06.352 --> 10:07.652
It's temporary, Ben.

10:08.686 --> 10:09.687
Once you're elected,
you'll be--

10:09.721 --> 10:13.124
What if that doesn't happen?
What if I lose?

10:13.158 --> 10:15.159
You can't.

10:15.193 --> 10:17.395
Kane may be
in the driver's seat now,

10:17.429 --> 10:19.397
but you have
what he never will--

10:19.431 --> 10:21.532
a future
in a higher office.

10:21.566 --> 10:23.734
"The New York Times,"
"The Washington Post,"

10:23.768 --> 10:25.469
C-Span-- all covering
this debate.

10:25.504 --> 10:27.505
This is your time.

10:30.975 --> 10:32.142
Hey.

11:04.743 --> 11:06.243
You're winning this.

11:43.416 --> 11:44.783
What's the hurry?

11:49.956 --> 11:52.457
<i>May I come in?</i>

11:55.161 --> 11:57.062
I spoke with Joe Young.

11:57.096 --> 12:00.099
Seems his company has been hit with
several instances of vandalism.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.901
Equipment.

12:01.935 --> 12:04.270
Insurance is covering the lion's
share, but he's concerned

12:04.304 --> 12:06.772
the budget for the gardens could swell
if this type of thing continues.

12:06.807 --> 12:08.941
It won't.

12:08.976 --> 12:12.111
Children being punished,
sticking out tongues, acting up,

12:12.146 --> 12:14.814
yet still at the mercy
of the elder,

12:14.849 --> 12:17.017
their destinies
not their own.

12:17.051 --> 12:19.852
Tell Joe to beef up
his on-site security.

12:19.887 --> 12:22.288
Which could run
the same risk.

12:22.323 --> 12:24.591
Mona, don't worry
so much.

12:24.625 --> 12:27.027
You really are a dog
with a bone, aren't you?

12:28.696 --> 12:30.697
Or is it a boner?

12:36.370 --> 12:38.605
Enough!

12:38.639 --> 12:41.107
- Sir?
- Excuse me.

12:46.180 --> 12:47.880
What is it?

12:47.915 --> 12:50.216
I thought you should know that
perhaps in response to the arrests,

12:50.250 --> 12:52.852
Senator Walsh plans to blanket
cook County with advertising,

12:52.886 --> 12:54.554
<i>multiple spots
in prime time.</i>

12:54.588 --> 12:58.291
Give him an infusion-- Zajac--
a million from my PAC.

12:58.326 --> 13:01.361
Sir, with the mayoral election a year
away, I'm not sure that it's wise--

13:01.395 --> 13:03.930
I'll make it up.
I'm not concerned about money.

13:03.965 --> 13:05.732
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Todd,

13:05.766 --> 13:07.567
I have "The Sentinel" on the line
and Moretti's not available.

13:07.602 --> 13:09.436
- Take a message.
- What line?

13:15.510 --> 13:17.010
Tom Kane.

13:17.544 --> 13:18.745
Holy shit.

13:18.779 --> 13:20.747
Um, hi, Mr. mayor.

13:20.781 --> 13:22.782
I'm calling from "The Sentinel"
and I wondered

13:22.816 --> 13:24.817
if you'd care to respond on
today's corruption arrests.

13:24.852 --> 13:26.052
You want a quote?

13:26.086 --> 13:28.054
Yes. More arrests
forthcoming?

13:28.088 --> 13:29.923
Are there any
further plans--?

13:29.957 --> 13:33.727
My plan is
to do the right thing.

13:39.433 --> 13:40.868
<i>I don't know
where I belong.</i>

13:40.902 --> 13:44.505
Where I'm staying
is a prison to me.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.342
I know that sounds
ungrateful

13:48.377 --> 13:50.345
'cause it's a house
and not a cell,

13:50.379 --> 13:53.280
but I just feel
more alone there,

13:53.315 --> 13:55.215
always did.

13:55.250 --> 13:59.887
Or maybe I just
always felt alone.

14:02.057 --> 14:04.025
It's funny--

14:04.059 --> 14:06.561
Actually it's sad--
the only other person

14:06.596 --> 14:08.564
in my family
I ever connected with

14:08.598 --> 14:11.133
is sort of trapped too.

14:11.167 --> 14:14.403
He had a stroke.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.774
Sometimes I wonder
if it's better

14:17.808 --> 14:21.077
not being able
to think, feel.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.713
And I'm trying
to stay strong.

14:23.747 --> 14:25.714
I'm just not really sure
why I should at the moment.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.183
That's all
I have to say.

14:36.093 --> 14:38.060
A vacant home
helps no one.

14:38.095 --> 14:41.397
We have a situation where people
are in need of places to live

14:41.432 --> 14:43.566
and your banks,
which hold title

14:43.601 --> 14:45.135
on hundreds
of foreclosures,

14:45.169 --> 14:47.537
are in need
of financial relief.

14:47.572 --> 14:49.539
Fair market value's
off the table

14:49.574 --> 14:51.842
if we turn foreclosures
into rentals.

14:51.876 --> 14:54.344
Fair market values mean
nothing in this economy.

14:54.379 --> 14:56.113
<i>Even if we agree
to this,</i>

14:56.147 --> 14:57.948
your monthly numbers
are way too low.

14:57.983 --> 15:00.651
<i>We're talking homes that
are worth 300k and up.</i>

15:00.685 --> 15:02.553
She wants you to help,

15:02.587 --> 15:04.421
wants you.

15:04.456 --> 15:07.725
Homes that currently get
zero dollars per month

15:07.759 --> 15:09.960
while you wait
for real estate to recover.

15:09.995 --> 15:12.763
Would a $500 a month
subsidy for families

15:12.797 --> 15:15.132
make it easier
for your banks to bite?

15:15.166 --> 15:17.234
It would,
for a single year.

15:17.269 --> 15:20.137
You're doing the right thing
and they're fighting you,

15:20.172 --> 15:22.473
as if they hold
the reins.

15:22.507 --> 15:26.077
And if the market rebounds in six
months, we won't be able to sell.

15:26.112 --> 15:29.613
We'll be stuck with low-paying
renters indefinitely.

15:29.648 --> 15:31.916
<i>We have a no-fail
completion date of two years,</i>

15:31.950 --> 15:35.053
at which time residents will
vacate your foreclosures

15:35.087 --> 15:38.356
and return to their new
permanent homes in the Gardens.

15:38.390 --> 15:39.857
I can't speak
for my colleague,

15:39.892 --> 15:42.560
but it's unlikely
that First Midcentral

15:42.594 --> 15:45.029
will be able to help
at this time, Mr. Mayor.

15:45.063 --> 15:47.031
Apply pressure, Tom.

15:47.065 --> 15:49.033
Let them know
who's boss.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.768
Pull the trigger.

15:50.802 --> 15:52.570
Gentlemen,
with all due respect,

15:52.604 --> 15:54.739
<i>the city has done a tremendous
amount of business</i>

15:54.773 --> 15:56.307
<i>with both your
institutions.</i>

15:56.342 --> 15:58.743
City pensions.

15:58.777 --> 16:01.612
I suppose other banks--

16:01.647 --> 16:03.948
national, out of state,
downstate--

16:03.982 --> 16:05.750
would be
keenly interested

16:05.784 --> 16:07.552
in managing those funds.

16:13.358 --> 16:14.925
In order to have
enough properties

16:14.960 --> 16:17.896
to accommodate
this plan,

16:17.930 --> 16:19.898
you'll have to
make the court

16:19.932 --> 16:22.167
move our foreclosures through
the dockets quickly.

16:22.201 --> 16:25.470
If that becomes possible, I see no
reason why we can't make this work.

16:25.505 --> 16:27.939
Consider it done.

16:28.724 --> 16:30.175
Thank you, gentlemen.

16:30.209 --> 16:32.210
- Thanks for coming.
- We'll be in touch.

16:38.718 --> 16:41.754
I'll arrange your meeting with
the circuit court judge asap.

16:43.857 --> 16:45.357
Are you happy?

16:47.860 --> 16:49.461
With the way
that worked out.

16:49.495 --> 16:50.996
Yes.

17:01.774 --> 17:03.776
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:05.244 --> 17:07.212
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

17:07.247 --> 17:10.449
Thanks for the piece
you wrote on Catherine.

17:10.483 --> 17:12.885
Just so we're clear, I'm not
looking for any gratitude.

17:12.919 --> 17:14.887
Oh, okay.

17:14.922 --> 17:17.189
No, you can compliment
the article's accuracy

17:17.223 --> 17:19.191
or my literary style,

17:19.224 --> 17:22.228
but thanking me outright
suggests that I did you a favor.

17:22.262 --> 17:23.762
I did not.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.932
You did accept the information
I gave you though.

17:25.965 --> 17:28.634
Yeah, but had there not been a story
to write about Senator Walsh,

17:28.668 --> 17:30.002
I wouldn't have
written one.

17:30.037 --> 17:32.104
But you were right--
there's a governor's race

17:32.138 --> 17:35.107
for the first time
in a decade.

17:35.142 --> 17:36.576
That was a story.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.311
You're such a man
of integrity.

17:39.847 --> 17:41.814
- All right, I'll shut up now.
- Okay.

17:41.849 --> 17:44.617
- Hungry?
- No, actually I'm not.

17:44.652 --> 17:46.953
And I don't have a ton
of time here, so...

17:46.987 --> 17:49.188
So we're not eating?

17:49.223 --> 17:51.124
Sorry.

17:52.459 --> 17:55.228
Want to tell me why we're
at a restaurant then?

18:02.936 --> 18:04.904
Yeah, I'm just gonna
get something to go.

18:04.938 --> 18:06.772
Come on.

18:06.807 --> 18:09.475
Look, I appreciate tips
as much as the next guy,

18:09.509 --> 18:11.910
but like I said before,
I'm not interested

18:11.944 --> 18:14.379
in any sort of ongoing
tit-for-tat thing.

18:14.413 --> 18:15.880
All right?

18:15.915 --> 18:17.382
Okay.

18:17.416 --> 18:18.783
No, I'm serious.

18:26.892 --> 18:28.893
Look...

18:32.164 --> 18:34.599
I'm not that guy.

18:34.633 --> 18:36.868
Okay.

20:44.261 --> 20:48.098
My father called looking
for prescription number.

20:51.535 --> 20:53.536
Um...

20:55.072 --> 20:56.872
Hey.
Hey, Dad, it's me.

20:56.906 --> 20:59.207
Here's the number
for your refill.

21:00.710 --> 21:05.647
Um, 0579915.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.948
I miss you.

21:07.983 --> 21:11.385
Yeah, I have another
NA meeting tomorrow.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.959
I can't-- I can't do it like this.
I need help.

21:20.095 --> 21:21.896
I don't-- I don't--
I don't know.

21:21.931 --> 21:22.997
Please.

21:54.260 --> 21:56.261
Mind your
fucking business!

22:08.209 --> 22:09.676
Joe Young.

22:09.711 --> 22:12.045
The Gardens aren't your
business, you dead fuck.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.881
- Who is this?
- <i>Quit.</i>

22:13.915 --> 22:15.683
Shit's gonna keep
happening till you do.

22:15.718 --> 22:17.452
All right, look, I don't
know who the hell you are,

22:17.486 --> 22:18.787
but I got a pretty good
idea where you are,

22:18.821 --> 22:20.688
so let's just get
something straight, okay?

22:20.723 --> 22:23.391
<i>That contract-- it's mine.
And it's gonna stay that way.</i>

22:23.425 --> 22:25.794
You want to fuck with me?
You're fucking with your own mayor.

22:27.530 --> 22:29.230
<i>Are you afraid?</i>

22:29.265 --> 22:31.667
Is that why
you can't sleep--

22:31.701 --> 22:35.103
because you might not
wake up?

22:35.138 --> 22:37.105
I can
keep you awake.

22:37.140 --> 22:39.141
I can keep talking.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.964
You're up late.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.977
I've made arrangements for you to
be able to see your grandfather.

23:16.481 --> 23:18.448
Why would you
do that?

23:18.482 --> 23:20.450
Because I know
what he meant to you.

23:20.484 --> 23:23.019
- Means.
- I don't expect thanks.

23:24.922 --> 23:26.656
But I want you
to know--

23:26.691 --> 23:28.225
I'm not
the same man.

23:29.259 --> 23:30.895
You're delusional.

23:30.929 --> 23:32.296
I've changed.

23:35.134 --> 23:36.901
When can I see him?

23:36.936 --> 23:38.936
Tomorrow.

23:40.439 --> 23:43.007
♪ The sun
will come out ♪

23:43.042 --> 23:44.676
♪ tomorrow ♪

23:44.710 --> 23:47.145
<i>♪ bet your
bottom dollar ♪</i>

23:47.180 --> 23:49.148
♪ that tomorrow ♪

23:49.182 --> 23:51.350

23:51.384 --> 23:54.519

24:05.496 --> 24:07.497

24:13.203 --> 24:15.971
Sir, I understand
you're seeing Judge Scanlon today.

24:18.107 --> 24:20.976
You are not Stone.

24:21.011 --> 24:22.778
No.

24:22.812 --> 24:24.513
I'm not.

24:26.884 --> 24:29.085
However, I worked on housing
issues with the judge

24:29.119 --> 24:30.853
when I was with
Alderman Driscoll.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.622
I believe I could be of use
to you in the meeting.

24:32.656 --> 24:35.224
Mona and I can handle it.
Zajac.

24:35.259 --> 24:37.360
I tried to tell you
about him before.

24:37.394 --> 24:40.329
Transferred $1 million from
your PAC to his campaign fund.

24:40.364 --> 24:42.231
I'll head there
later today.

24:42.266 --> 24:45.034
- I said half that.
- Sir, I'm fairly certain that you requested--

24:45.068 --> 24:46.602
Why the hell
would I give him

24:46.636 --> 24:48.804
a million of my
fucking dollars?

24:48.839 --> 24:51.106
I'll pull the other half
back immediately.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.008
My mistake.

24:57.948 --> 25:00.883
You're betting
on the wrong horse.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.555
I was
right to do what I did.

25:05.589 --> 25:08.725
After me.
After us.

25:10.294 --> 25:12.629
Am I the only one
who knows what he wants?

25:14.064 --> 25:16.833
Mr. Langley suffers from
late-onset schizophrenia,

25:16.867 --> 25:19.669
has some disorganized thoughts,
but not to an extreme degree.

25:19.703 --> 25:22.371
Enough to keep him from executing
the assassination attempt?

25:22.406 --> 25:25.408
Not necessarily, though he does
struggle with the concept of time.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.943
The larger concern
for you, I think,

25:27.978 --> 25:30.079
is the physical limitation
that might exist.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.715
- Such as?
- <i>His eyesight.</i>

25:32.750 --> 25:36.620
He has previously undiagnosed
open-angle glaucoma.

25:36.654 --> 25:39.423
<i>To take that shot...</i>

25:39.458 --> 25:41.492
Motherfucker.

25:47.033 --> 25:49.401
Incompetence, greed,

25:49.436 --> 25:51.403
and finally
the unmitigated gall

25:51.438 --> 25:54.039
to march their highly-paid
attorneys into my courtroom

25:54.074 --> 25:56.142
- and demand leniency.
- Criminal.

25:56.176 --> 25:59.045
And yet the irony is,

25:59.079 --> 26:01.047
we're in civil
proceedings.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.148
Doesn't that one
work for Driscoll?

26:03.183 --> 26:04.416
Used to.

26:04.451 --> 26:06.418
Recently he's become
an advisor to the mayor.

26:06.452 --> 26:08.419
Seems young for that.

26:08.454 --> 26:10.355
In any event,

26:10.389 --> 26:12.958
part of the reason
it's taking so damn long

26:12.992 --> 26:15.059
is the sloppiness
of the paperwork,

26:15.094 --> 26:17.562
the way they sliced
and diced mortgagees.

26:17.596 --> 26:19.564
Banks can't prove
their own liens.

26:19.598 --> 26:21.566
Believe me, I'd like
nothing better

26:21.600 --> 26:24.369
than to push these foreclosures
through as quick as I can.

26:24.404 --> 26:26.472
Then we're on the same page,
which is no surprise.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.140
I remember the night
you won your seat,

26:28.174 --> 26:30.442
stood by you as you made a
victory speech like no other.

26:30.476 --> 26:32.577
Glad to have been
a part of your success.

26:32.612 --> 26:35.247
<i>We're hoping to relocate
residents as soon as possible.</i>

26:35.281 --> 26:37.850
But that would require
your active enforcement

26:37.884 --> 26:40.919
of eviction proceedings against
those inhabiting foreclosures.

26:40.954 --> 26:43.355
Some of whom have squatted
for a year or more.

26:44.389 --> 26:47.492
This housing crisis
nonsense

26:47.526 --> 26:50.729
has been quite draining for those
of us on the Circuit Court bench,

26:50.763 --> 26:54.433
what with our four-year
election cycles.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.435
Greed has no edges,

26:56.469 --> 26:58.437
no bottom.

26:58.471 --> 27:00.439
Always they want more.

27:00.473 --> 27:02.875
My colleagues
on the Appellate Court

27:02.909 --> 27:06.179
are blessed
with 10-year terms--

27:06.213 --> 27:08.614
<i>something I have
long envied</i>

27:08.649 --> 27:11.250
<i>as retirement
has approached.</i>

27:14.621 --> 27:16.589
<i>I'm sure the mayor
would continue</i>

27:16.623 --> 27:19.859
his support of your career, should
you decide to make such a move.

27:19.893 --> 27:21.861
He's even porcine
in appearance.

27:21.895 --> 27:23.863
Look at that snout.

27:23.897 --> 27:25.798
And I his.

27:28.134 --> 27:29.668
So...

27:29.702 --> 27:31.603
<i>There are several hundred
foreclosures</i>

27:31.637 --> 27:34.005
in the Ashburn/Morgan park
areas that'd be ideal for--

27:34.040 --> 27:35.573
Pig.

27:36.609 --> 27:38.143
Excuse me?

27:38.177 --> 27:40.778
You're a pig.

27:40.813 --> 27:42.647
I won't be
insulted, Tom,

27:42.681 --> 27:44.949
not when you're asking
for my help.

27:50.922 --> 27:52.957
It's fine.

27:52.991 --> 27:54.959
We'll get there.

28:00.633 --> 28:03.335
<i>How sure are we on
the timing of this thing?</i>

28:03.369 --> 28:05.771
Very. "The Ledger"'s
fully on board.

28:05.805 --> 28:08.708
<i>Well, I still think that opening remarks
should focus on fiscal issues.</i>

28:08.742 --> 28:10.443
Once we're in the body
of this debate,

28:10.478 --> 28:12.479
there's not gonna be an
opportunity to talk about--

28:12.513 --> 28:13.914
Tina, her base
isn't a factor.

28:13.948 --> 28:16.149
We need to appeal
to the collar countries.

28:16.184 --> 28:18.752
We? She's been here,
what, a month?

28:18.786 --> 28:21.722
There's no room for ego
at the table,

28:21.756 --> 28:23.123
<i>not when Kitty's
helped me</i>

28:23.157 --> 28:25.492
<i>get closer to a win
than I've ever been.</i>

28:25.526 --> 28:27.761
She knows the players.

28:28.963 --> 28:30.864
So pause after
the second line

28:30.899 --> 28:32.833
for applause from
the live audience,

28:32.867 --> 28:35.635
which will tee up the at-home
viewers for the follow-up on crime.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.304
Great.
Love it.

28:37.338 --> 28:39.974
There'll be plenty of time to sell
her fiscal platform afterwards.

28:40.008 --> 28:41.709
What if all this
doesn't work?

28:42.711 --> 28:44.646
It will.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.148
<i>Love, respect, kindness--</i>

28:47.183 --> 28:48.950
<i>all three
are necessary</i>

28:48.985 --> 28:51.053
<i>in a healthy
relationship.</i>

28:51.087 --> 28:53.756
I got none of those
from my ex.

28:53.790 --> 28:56.059
But when
I was floating,

28:56.093 --> 28:58.461
<i>I didn't need it.</i>

28:58.496 --> 29:01.798
<i>It was like it was
calling me.</i>

29:01.833 --> 29:03.868
<i>But now that
i'm clean,</i>

29:03.902 --> 29:06.437
<i>I have my family's
support,</i>

29:06.471 --> 29:09.106
<i>i'm not
on the streets,</i>

29:09.140 --> 29:11.107
<i>it's a little easier.</i>

29:11.142 --> 29:13.710
<i>But it's still a day-by-day
process, you know?</i>

29:34.031 --> 29:35.932
You miss me
or you miss using?

29:35.967 --> 29:40.003
What? You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

29:41.539 --> 29:43.506
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

29:43.541 --> 29:45.775
I'm sorry.

29:56.987 --> 29:58.721
Here.

30:02.059 --> 30:04.027
It's all I got.

30:06.998 --> 30:09.933
You're a fucking
drug dealer.

30:09.967 --> 30:12.402
I-- I'm sorry.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.671
I'm sorry.
I don't even know what I'm saying.

30:14.705 --> 30:17.274
- I'm sorry. I'm a mess.
- Look, look...

30:17.308 --> 30:19.276
- I'm sorry.
- I'll get more, all right?

30:19.310 --> 30:21.945
I-- I just want to be
in control of it.

30:21.980 --> 30:23.514
All right?

30:23.548 --> 30:25.549
Yeah. Yeah.

30:30.321 --> 30:32.089
So is that it?

30:33.492 --> 30:35.493
No, of course not.

30:35.527 --> 30:36.794
No.

30:39.498 --> 30:42.100
You're the only
good thing in my life.

30:58.005 --> 30:59.716
All right,
hey, everybody,

30:59.751 --> 31:01.618
listen up real quick.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.687
Half a million dollars.

31:03.721 --> 31:05.455
Hello, statewide
media blitz.

31:07.491 --> 31:10.627
- So what's the catch?
- I give up my firstborn?

31:10.662 --> 31:13.463
The mayor found it important to
show his support at this time.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.932
Really? While simultaneously
throwing a rock

31:15.966 --> 31:17.834
into my get-out-the-vote
operation?

31:19.269 --> 31:21.237
Whatever,

31:21.271 --> 31:23.306
as long as
it doesn't bounce.

31:25.910 --> 31:28.945
So any talking points

31:28.980 --> 31:30.881
for tonight,
about the sweep business?

31:30.915 --> 31:32.483
Applaud his
anti-corruption efforts.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.786
<i>Beyond that, it's just
skirting the issue.</i>

31:34.820 --> 31:36.287
Okay.

31:36.322 --> 31:38.790
Well, you want to at least
clue me in on his long game

31:38.824 --> 31:40.525
so I can skirt the issue
intelligently?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.494
I think your focus
should be on family,

31:42.528 --> 31:44.663
<i>in light of the senator's
lack thereof.</i>

31:44.698 --> 31:47.299
So what you're saying is
you have no idea. Do you?

31:47.334 --> 31:50.569
The mayor doesn't really owe me or
anyone an explanation, does he?

31:52.706 --> 31:55.240
Let our office know how these
funds will be distributed.

31:59.679 --> 32:01.747
I will.

32:06.353 --> 32:08.587
<i>Are you feeling
anxious at all?</i>

32:08.621 --> 32:09.755
Not anxious.

32:09.789 --> 32:11.757
Impatient.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.325
Time is proving
elusive.

32:15.495 --> 32:17.429
And the hallucinations?

32:17.464 --> 32:19.431
Manageable,

32:19.466 --> 32:21.133
if irritating.

32:21.168 --> 32:23.168
That hurts
my feelings, Tom.

32:24.204 --> 32:26.605
Are they in the form
of people?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.574
Primarily, yes.

32:28.608 --> 32:29.742
Living or dead?

32:29.776 --> 32:31.110
Both.

32:32.813 --> 32:34.814
And your judgment?

32:39.553 --> 32:41.520
Keen.

32:41.555 --> 32:44.256
There's a clarity,

32:44.291 --> 32:46.759
a righteousness.

32:46.793 --> 32:49.295
My path is clear.

32:51.231 --> 32:54.100
There are occasions
with Lewy Body

32:54.134 --> 32:57.069
<i>in which one's behavior
can skew manic.</i>

32:57.103 --> 32:59.872
Is that something you feel you'd
be able to recognize in yourself?

32:59.906 --> 33:02.074
- Yes.
- No.

33:02.108 --> 33:05.511
If you are feeling bad,
as I suspect you might be,

33:05.546 --> 33:07.346
we should seriously
consider the use--

33:07.381 --> 33:10.617
I have not experienced tremors.
I do not intend to.

33:10.651 --> 33:13.587
They're only gonna get
worse-- these delusions.

33:14.822 --> 33:17.824
There is a clinic
in Toronto

33:17.859 --> 33:19.827
experimenting in
alternative treatments.

33:19.861 --> 33:21.362
<i>Alternative.</i>

33:21.396 --> 33:23.330
Their work is untested
and unproven,

33:23.365 --> 33:25.365
the risks undocumented.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.435
You don't have to go to Canada
to mitigate all this.

33:32.040 --> 33:35.108
Aricept-- it's
a cholinesterase inhibitor.

33:35.142 --> 33:37.177
At a certain point,
it's better to shake

33:37.211 --> 33:39.012
than to go mad.

33:41.849 --> 33:43.684
Too late, Tom.

34:18.918 --> 34:20.918
<i>Where are we
with evictions?</i>

34:23.289 --> 34:25.255
- Nowhere.
- Condemnations?

34:25.291 --> 34:27.725
Notices can be placed right
away, but without housing--

34:27.760 --> 34:29.260
- We'll find it.
- We had it.

34:29.293 --> 34:31.696
<i>All Scanlon wanted
was your help</i>

34:31.730 --> 34:33.598
in positioning him
for the appellate court.

34:33.632 --> 34:36.367
I don't understand
why you didn't capitulate,

34:36.400 --> 34:39.337
even temporarily,
why you had to insult him.

34:39.371 --> 34:41.339
Honestly, it was
a huge mistake.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.074
A mistake?

34:44.643 --> 34:47.110
We could be posting eviction
notices right now--

34:47.146 --> 34:49.681
Was it a mistake
to hand you a job

34:49.715 --> 34:52.384
that allowed you to actually
serve your community?

34:52.418 --> 34:54.920
I don't intend
any disrespect.

34:54.954 --> 34:57.089
Your unwavering appreciation--
where is it?

34:57.123 --> 34:58.190
I-- I just--

34:58.224 --> 35:00.192
This is my thanks?

35:00.226 --> 35:02.661
What do you think I did this for?
For world fucking peace?

35:03.695 --> 35:05.464
I'm fairly certain

35:05.499 --> 35:07.499
you did it
for yourself.

35:15.242 --> 35:17.210
Sir, we have to prep
this room for the debate.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.947
Will you be watching
with the staff?

35:28.790 --> 35:29.823
No.

35:33.828 --> 35:36.163
You said you could help
with Scanlon.

35:37.197 --> 35:38.132
Yes, sir.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.500
Do so.

35:53.548 --> 35:55.883
Strangled, asphyxiated,
or both?

35:55.917 --> 35:58.352
Definitely strangled.

35:58.386 --> 36:00.387
So what's
in his mouth?

36:06.896 --> 36:08.496
A map.

36:10.866 --> 36:13.267
You're losing
friends, Tom.

36:13.302 --> 36:16.838
There are others.

36:16.872 --> 36:19.607
Worse than that,
you're losing control.

36:19.641 --> 36:21.676
She made me angry.

36:27.316 --> 36:28.850
You made her cry.

36:28.885 --> 36:30.352
I didn't mean to.

36:30.386 --> 36:31.687
But you did.

36:31.721 --> 36:33.422
You hurt people.
You can't help yourself.

36:33.456 --> 36:34.990
That is not true!

36:35.025 --> 36:37.359
Of course it's true.

36:37.394 --> 36:38.661
Look at me!

36:38.695 --> 36:41.163
No! I'm sick of it--

36:41.198 --> 36:43.799
All the talking,
the harassing, the haunting.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.334
I can't think!

36:51.774 --> 36:54.343
You're not thinking.
That's the problem.

36:54.377 --> 36:57.346
You're just doing whatever you
want to whomever you want.

36:57.380 --> 37:01.316
This is your fault-- these
missteps, these mistakes.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.652
Oh, no, Tom.

37:03.686 --> 37:06.821
This is all you.

37:06.856 --> 37:09.858
Don't you dare
fucking blame me.

37:09.892 --> 37:13.628
You're not real,
not here.

37:37.151 --> 37:39.152
Would you excuse me
for one second?

37:54.769 --> 37:56.437
Where's your candidate?

37:56.472 --> 37:59.307
She'll be out
in a minute.

37:59.342 --> 38:02.310
I don't think I ever will
understand your choices,

38:02.345 --> 38:05.380
but I hope
you're happy.

38:16.259 --> 38:18.294
There you are.

38:18.328 --> 38:19.829
We wanted
to wish you luck.

38:19.863 --> 38:22.499
Oh, well, thank you, sweetie.
Come here, buddy.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.901
Let's fix your tie.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.672
Well, good luck
out there.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.407
Same to you.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.409
You look good.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.411
Saw Walsh backstage--

38:34.446 --> 38:36.413
no contest.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.048
Of course not.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.050
Come on, boys,
let's go find our seats.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.253
And don't forget-- the
blonde in the green dress.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.722
Yeah, got it.
Family values.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.169
And I want the camera focused
on her at that moment, okay?

38:58.203 --> 39:00.505
So it has to be off her.
So just make sure that whatev--

39:07.312 --> 39:09.280
Okay, thanks.

39:18.057 --> 39:20.091
How do I look?

39:20.125 --> 39:23.161
You look good,
respectable.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.463
Ha-ha.

39:25.998 --> 39:27.565
Break a leg.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.934
Really? That's
the best you can do?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.776
Full house out there.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.579
I'll go see how close
we are to air.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.884
Senator Jacobs,
Congressman Wexler,

39:45.918 --> 39:47.919
Taft, Hannigan and
half a dozen aldermen

39:47.953 --> 39:49.454
all here
in support.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.489
Excellent.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.061
<i>Are you ready
for this?</i>

39:56.095 --> 39:59.263
Any feelings
getting in the way?

39:59.298 --> 40:01.499
No. No feelings.

40:01.533 --> 40:04.736
<i>Welcome to the
great gubernatorial debate.</i>

40:04.770 --> 40:07.338
<i>Our candidates will open
with brief statements</i>

40:07.372 --> 40:10.475
<i>and then we will take
questions from our audience.</i>

40:10.509 --> 40:13.712
<i>State Treasure Zajac
won the coin toss</i>

40:13.746 --> 40:16.047
<i>and he will go first.
Please.</i>

40:16.082 --> 40:18.049
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:18.084 --> 40:20.552
<i>I am humbled
by this opportunity</i>

40:20.586 --> 40:22.787
to have this conversation
with you all today,

40:22.821 --> 40:26.290
to hearing your concerns
and answering your questions.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.125
<i>There's no mediators,
no pundits,</i>

40:28.159 --> 40:31.328
just you and me talking
about our great state

40:31.362 --> 40:33.129
and my vision
for its future--

40:33.164 --> 40:35.298
a future filled
with forward motion,

40:35.333 --> 40:37.167
<i>with progress
and hope,</i>

40:37.201 --> 40:39.836
<i>not saddled with the failed
politics of the past.</i>

40:39.871 --> 40:42.873
And that's what we'll get if
Senator Walsh is elected.

40:42.907 --> 40:45.242
She will take us
backwards.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.310
And I'm not one to want
to live in yesterday.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.012
<i>And I doubt
that you are either,</i>

40:49.046 --> 40:51.448
<i>so let's live for now,
Illinois.</i>

40:51.482 --> 40:52.615
Thank you.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.189
<i>All right, thank
you, Mr. Zajac.</i>

40:58.223 --> 41:00.190
<i>Senator Walsh, please.</i>

41:00.224 --> 41:02.593
Picture perfect.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.962
Unlike Mr. Zajac,
I don't mind

41:04.996 --> 41:06.730
looking back
from time to time.

41:06.765 --> 41:10.368
The fact is, I have a substantial
public service record

41:10.403 --> 41:11.936
<i>and I'm proud
of it.</i>

41:11.971 --> 41:14.706
And that record
is available for review.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.041
Now.

41:16.075 --> 41:18.043
And like Mr. Zajac,

41:18.077 --> 41:20.045
I care about
the future too.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.481
But experience
has taught me

41:22.516 --> 41:24.884
<i>that action,
rather than rhetoric,</i>

41:24.918 --> 41:26.886
<i>provides what
people need</i>

41:26.920 --> 41:29.322
<i>to help prepare
for that future.</i>

41:29.356 --> 41:32.693
I really hope
that today we can focus

41:32.727 --> 41:34.928
on the real issues
that face us--

41:34.962 --> 41:37.330
crime, drugs,

41:37.365 --> 41:39.799
the need to fix
the social safety net,

41:39.833 --> 41:42.969
because while talk
of the past and the future

41:43.004 --> 41:45.138
might make for
a great campaign spot,

41:45.172 --> 41:47.374
it's what
we actually do

41:47.408 --> 41:49.676
that matters.
Thank you.

41:52.512 --> 41:54.480
<i>Thank you, Senator Walsh.</i>

41:54.514 --> 41:57.149
<i>We will now open the floor
for questions.</i>

41:57.184 --> 41:59.852
<i>And, Mr. Zajac, you'll be
first to ask questions.</i>

41:59.886 --> 42:03.556
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

42:03.590 --> 42:05.257
<i>Thank you.</i>

42:05.291 --> 42:07.326
Let's begin with a young
lady in the green dress.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.827
<i>Can you tell us
how your opponent</i>

42:08.862 --> 42:11.396
can possibly understand
the plight of families...

42:11.431 --> 42:13.966
<i>...When she herself does not have one?</i>

42:14.000 --> 42:16.768
<i>I do not believe that
my opponent's life choices</i>

42:16.803 --> 42:18.770
<i>make her any less
able to,</i>

42:18.804 --> 42:21.973
<i>but what I do know
is that having a wife</i>

42:22.007 --> 42:24.742
<i>and that having children has
personally opened my eyes</i>

42:24.777 --> 42:26.978
<i>in ways that I never
dreamed possible.</i>

42:27.012 --> 42:29.280
<i>I used to be that guy
who didn't want</i>

42:29.314 --> 42:31.748
<i>the noisy kids
next to him on the airplane.</i>

42:31.783 --> 42:33.751
Now I got a couple of them.

42:33.785 --> 42:36.553
<i>And while at times</i>

42:36.588 --> 42:39.056
<i>emotional
and exhausting</i>

42:39.090 --> 42:40.990
<i>and of course
expensive,</i>

42:41.025 --> 42:44.694
I'm grateful
every single day

42:44.728 --> 42:47.062
that I get to be
a husband and a father.

42:47.097 --> 42:49.431
Thank you.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.605
<i>Senator.</i>

42:56.639 --> 43:00.109
Yeah, the woman
in the blue scarf.

43:00.143 --> 43:02.477
This question is actually
for Mr. Zajac.

43:02.512 --> 43:05.146
<i>Mr. Zajac,</i>

43:05.181 --> 43:08.383
Who is the woman
in the picture

43:08.418 --> 43:10.952
<i>just posted by
"The Springfield Ledger"?</i>

43:20.629 --> 43:22.196
<i>I--</i>

43:22.230 --> 43:24.331
I'd rather not--

43:24.365 --> 43:26.333
I'd rather not, uh, uh--

43:26.367 --> 43:28.701
<i>I'd rather not comment
on an unconfirmed photograph.</i>

43:28.736 --> 43:30.703
<i>This is not
a matter of--</i>

43:30.738 --> 43:33.373
- of public discourse at this time.
- Isn't this a picture of you and Alderman Ross's wife?

43:34.408 --> 43:35.875
<i>My candidacy--</i>

43:35.909 --> 43:38.311
and we're here to--
to debate the issues.

43:38.345 --> 43:40.780
Did you have an affair
with Alderman Ross's wife?

43:40.815 --> 43:42.782
Again--

43:42.816 --> 43:45.618
again, this isn't the venue for
matters of personal nature.

43:45.652 --> 43:48.121
We're here to talk about
the issues facing Illinois

43:48.155 --> 43:50.556
- and about our cand--
- Just answer the question.

43:50.591 --> 43:52.558
- Ladies and gent--
- Were you having an affair with Tia Ross?

43:52.593 --> 43:54.560
- Ladies and gentlemen, this--
- Answer the question!

43:54.595 --> 43:56.329
- I--
- Is this Tia Ross?

44:13.947 --> 44:16.415
And to think it was all
of your own making.

44:18.519 --> 44:21.554
Sir, I--

44:21.589 --> 44:24.024
I can't talk right now.

44:24.058 --> 44:26.059
Joe Young is dead.

44:27.461 --> 44:31.264
Hammond police
found him in his truck,

44:31.299 --> 44:34.134
strangled,

44:34.168 --> 44:36.503
with a map of Chicago
in his mouth.

44:36.537 --> 44:38.505
Your friends
are your enemies,

44:38.539 --> 44:40.540
and vice versa.

44:43.711 --> 44:45.679
Given everything
that's happened,

44:45.713 --> 44:48.748
I think it's best

44:48.782 --> 44:50.583
if we just slow
everything down.

44:55.522 --> 44:57.756
I'll leave you
to your thoughts.

45:16.374 --> 45:19.176
As I'm sure you're aware, the
mayor has a sense of humor.

45:19.210 --> 45:21.178
He wasn't joking.

45:21.213 --> 45:23.180
And, frankly,
I had no idea he harbored

45:23.214 --> 45:26.350
such animosity toward me
all these years.

45:26.384 --> 45:28.385
He doesn't.

45:28.419 --> 45:30.387
In fact, he intends
to provide you

45:30.421 --> 45:33.290
with all the tools necessary for
your transition to higher court.

45:36.728 --> 45:39.163
He sent you
to apologize for him?

45:39.197 --> 45:40.197
No.

45:42.634 --> 45:45.402
But I am

45:45.437 --> 45:47.504
apologizing.

45:52.677 --> 45:54.744
You're new in his office,

45:54.779 --> 45:56.646
just like the woman I met.

45:56.681 --> 45:59.483
She was quite
impressive.

46:00.167 --> 46:03.420
I bet you'd like to be
impressive too.

46:04.856 --> 46:06.023
I would.

46:10.095 --> 46:13.231
Then...

46:13.265 --> 46:15.233
Perhaps we can be

46:15.268 --> 46:17.369
of mutual benefit
to one another.

46:17.403 --> 46:19.404
That was my thinking.

47:11.494 --> 47:12.761
Hi. I'm--

47:12.796 --> 47:15.163
I know who you are.

47:15.198 --> 47:16.298
Is he awake?

47:16.332 --> 47:18.334
It's hard to tell.

47:26.744 --> 47:28.211
Grandpa,

47:28.745 --> 47:31.214
it's me.
It's Emma.

47:31.748 --> 47:34.284
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

47:36.087 --> 47:38.455
Years.
He seems worse.

47:38.489 --> 47:41.024
A pretty bad stroke he had,
from what I understand.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.795
Do you think
he understands?

47:44.829 --> 47:46.096
Probably not.

47:50.802 --> 47:55.072
Sorry, but you might want to step
into the other room for a minute.

47:55.106 --> 47:57.508
<i>I have to change
his catheter bag.</i>

48:02.314 --> 48:05.015
Well, I can do it
for him.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.818
I used to run
a clinic.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.622
I want to help
however I can.

48:12.991 --> 48:14.992
Suit yourself.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.735
Kids, churches,
soccer moms--

48:24.769 --> 48:26.737
run all the spots we have
with that sort of imagery.

48:26.771 --> 48:29.072
Think there's a chance any others
will come out of the woodwork?

48:29.107 --> 48:30.540
Maybe.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.209
Wow.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.714
I get it.
You disapprove.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.751
No, I like front-page sex
as much as the next guy.

48:41.785 --> 48:43.486
Whatever.

48:46.556 --> 48:48.057
That's all it was?

48:48.091 --> 48:50.059
Plan A--
leak it to "The Sentinel";

48:50.093 --> 48:51.827
That doesn't work--
go to "The Ledger"?

48:54.932 --> 48:56.466
No.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.302
That's not all it was.

48:58.836 --> 49:00.304
You know,
the funny thing is

49:00.998 --> 49:03.007
I can't even tell
when you're bullshitting me.

49:03.541 --> 49:05.609
Don't worry.

49:05.644 --> 49:07.945
I won't come at you
again, okay?

49:11.483 --> 49:12.717
Hey.

49:15.854 --> 49:17.855
I'm not worried.

49:33.472 --> 49:37.842
Could have been Kane, though I don't
know why he played it a second time.

49:40.046 --> 49:42.047
Kitty.

49:44.550 --> 49:46.518
Town hall setting,

49:46.553 --> 49:49.287
<i>Cook County.</i>

49:49.322 --> 49:50.656
She's good.

49:53.492 --> 49:56.828
Was it anger

49:56.863 --> 49:58.396
or opportunism?

49:58.431 --> 50:01.399
It is always politically
motivated for her.

50:07.072 --> 50:08.440
What do you want to do?

50:08.474 --> 50:10.041
Nothing.

50:15.214 --> 50:17.949
A single press appearance
together,

50:18.483 --> 50:21.486
mea culpa.

50:24.090 --> 50:26.825
And then we just hope that something
shitty happens in the world

50:26.860 --> 50:28.961
and bumps us
from the news cycle.

50:30.863 --> 50:32.764
I'm not gonna do that.

50:36.235 --> 50:37.969
I'm not gonna have
my sons grow up

50:38.004 --> 50:39.871
with some humiliating
picture of me

50:39.906 --> 50:42.607
<i>standing next to their
promiscuous father and think,</i>

50:42.641 --> 50:45.877
"yeah, that's what
a good wife does."

50:48.947 --> 50:51.281
I want them to be
better than that.

50:54.268 --> 50:56.286
I'm better than that.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.326
All right, I'll make
a statement alone.

51:03.361 --> 51:06.029
I'll go right at it.

51:06.063 --> 51:09.432
This is something that
happened in the past,

51:09.466 --> 51:12.201
something we worked hard
to get through

51:12.236 --> 51:14.804
with counseling
and faith.

51:17.341 --> 51:19.742
To hear you say it

51:19.777 --> 51:21.911
almost makes me
believe it.

51:26.150 --> 51:27.684
It can be true,
Maggie.

51:40.663 --> 51:43.064
I don't want you
at the house.

52:11.159 --> 52:12.927
<i>He's finished, toast.</i>

52:12.961 --> 52:14.962
<i>There is no coming back
from this.</i>

52:17.966 --> 52:20.635
It's the pictures.
And it's sordid.

52:20.669 --> 52:24.038
<i>While the Clinton, Spitzer and Sanford situations
were devastating,</i>

52:24.073 --> 52:26.040
<i>there were
no pictures.</i>

52:26.075 --> 52:28.777
<i>We're visual people.
Those pictures will burn</i>

52:28.811 --> 52:30.445
<i>in the electorate's
mind forever.</i>

52:30.480 --> 52:33.616
<i>Put a fork in him.
Zajac is done.</i>

52:35.018 --> 52:37.387
Obviously this is
very shocking,

52:37.421 --> 52:39.389
<i>but I am
less interested</i>

52:39.423 --> 52:41.157
<i>in the treasurer's
private life</i>

52:41.192 --> 52:43.460
<i>than I am
in his ability to lead.</i>

52:43.494 --> 52:45.062
And while a private matter
such as this

52:45.096 --> 52:46.931
does not belong
in the public eye,

52:46.965 --> 52:50.467
<i>one can't help but consider what
it says about his character.</i>

52:50.502 --> 52:53.270
My friends
are my enemies.

52:55.072 --> 52:57.106
Langley didn't pull
the trigger.

52:57.141 --> 52:59.475
The shooter's still
out there.

53:00.477 --> 53:02.044
Find the shooter.

53:02.079 --> 53:03.479
We're working on it.

53:03.513 --> 53:05.614
Find the goddamn shooter!

53:05.649 --> 53:08.651
I'm not one of your
subordinates.

53:08.685 --> 53:11.788
You will speak to me
with respect.

53:15.559 --> 53:17.961
I'm sorry.

53:30.107 --> 53:32.075
Sir, you'll be pleased
to know I was able

53:32.109 --> 53:34.077
to get judge Scanlon
to agree to your terms.

53:34.111 --> 53:36.513
I need to go.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.749
Get me my car.

53:41.519 --> 53:42.719
Yes, sir.

54:12.684 --> 54:14.852
I am-- I am--

54:14.887 --> 54:17.622
control-- in control.

54:18.958 --> 54:20.458
I gave an order.

54:20.492 --> 54:22.860
- Sir?
- I told them to fix that pothole.

54:22.895 --> 54:26.030
- Is it still there?
- Do they not recognize my authority? Stop the car.

54:26.065 --> 54:28.600
- Sir--
- Does nobody listen? Stop the goddamn car.

54:38.443 --> 54:40.311
Why should
anyone listen...

54:40.345 --> 54:41.545
You are not here!

54:41.580 --> 54:44.215
...When you are
clearly insane?

54:44.249 --> 54:47.851
I am the goddamn mayor
of this motherfucking city

54:47.886 --> 54:49.687
and I want this hole
fixed now!

54:49.721 --> 54:51.855
Fuck! Shit!

54:51.890 --> 54:53.857
Scumbags, show yourselves!

54:53.892 --> 54:55.259
I'm in control.

54:55.293 --> 54:58.563
I will not be
questioned!

55:33.531 --> 55:35.499
- Keys.
- Sir.

55:35.534 --> 55:37.735
- Keys.
- They're in the ignition.

55:55.456 --> 55:57.790
Don't follow me.

56:40.968 --> 56:43.303
Where are we going, Tom?
