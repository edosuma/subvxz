28:49.762 --> 28:52.796

28:52.798 --> 28:57.034
the four pillars of a solid

28:58.136 --> 28:59.903
Yes, sir.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.206

the emotional
and the spiritual.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.100

You know what a thesis is?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.842
Uh, an idea.

29:38.844 --> 29:42.045
Exactly. An idea which attempts
to explain something.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.114
Lays it out to be
proved or disproved.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.116
So here's our thesis:

29:46.118 --> 29:49.520
It's 36 miles across the bay
from Santa Cruz to Monterey.

29:49.522 --> 29:52.389
The day that you can
paddle that far

29:52.391 --> 29:54.992
will be the day
you're ready to surf Mavericks.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.493
Not a moment sooner.

29:56.495 --> 29:57.895
Frosty, that's impossible.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.531
Oh, more so than you know.

30:00.533 --> 30:03.267
So the physical will represent
the sheer strength

30:03.269 --> 30:05.068
needed to make the paddle.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.271
So you're gonna be doing this
from now on, every day,

30:07.273 --> 30:08.939
12 weeks.

30:08.941 --> 30:13.177
And the mental will be tied
to your own research.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.312
The calculation
of the tides and swells,

30:15.314 --> 30:17.414
and, of course, your ability
to navigate them all.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.287
So, Monterey equals Mavericks.
Deal?

30:24.422 --> 30:27.891
