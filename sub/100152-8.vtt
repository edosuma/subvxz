00:43.252 --> 00:45.754
Mrs. Baldwin? Dr. Josephson.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.674
Hi, Karen Baldwin. Shane's mother.
How's he doing?

00:49.091 --> 00:51.051
Is there a Mr. Baldwin?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.221
Yes. But he's unavailable at the moment.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.890
He's on the moon.

00:56.974 --> 01:00.310
He's on the-- Your husband is Ed Baldwin?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.938
Yes, he is. Can you please tell me
how my son is doing?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.480
-Please, sit.
-I'm fine.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.067
I don't need to sit. I just wanna know
what happened to my son.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.779
Paramedics reported a motor vehicle
to bicycle accident.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.739
Well, who hit him?

01:12.823 --> 01:14.449
We don't know. The driver left the scene.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.786
A neighbor found him in the street
and called for an ambulance.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.705
He was wearing a basketball uniform.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.291
A basketball uniform?

01:23.959 --> 01:26.378
All right, so what did he break?

01:28.922 --> 01:31.633
Your son has sustained serious
head injuries.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.636
His skull was fractured,
and there's bleeding in the brain.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.891
Wait.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.144
Wait. Wait.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.563
He what?

01:44.646 --> 01:48.066
We're doing our best to help him. He's
in surgery right now to drain the blood

01:48.150 --> 01:50.152
and to alleviate some
of the pressure from his brain.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.070
No, he's in surgery?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.156
He's in--

01:54.239 --> 01:57.659
No, nobody asked me about surgery. Shane's
never been under anesthesia before.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.163
It's a lifesaving intervention,
Mrs. Baldwin. We had no choice.

02:01.663 --> 02:05.083
I'm sorry. Lifesaving?

02:06.418 --> 02:09.880
What the hell is going on here? No.
I thought he broke a bone or something.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.173
I know. It's okay.

02:11.256 --> 02:15.802
-No, this is not okay. This is not okay.
-Let's just calm down.

02:15.886 --> 02:20.807
And if the surgery helps, and a lot
of times it does, then that's a good sign.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.812
Shane is young,
and youth is always on our side.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.024
Okay.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.027
Yeah.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.404
Shane is strong.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.739
I don't doubt it.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.325
He's gonna be just fine.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.247
Come with me. We have a private
waiting area for family members.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.541
Okay. Yeah.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.132
No, he's gonna be fine.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.884
-We're doing everything we can.
-Okay.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.803
-I'll keep you updated.
-Thank you.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.417
Morning, sunshine.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.877
Morning, Dani.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.757
What's for breakfast today?
Eggs, bacon, pancakes?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.717
I finally get a chance for
some peace and quiet,

05:01.844 --> 05:03.679
and they put you and Gordo on CAPCOM.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.515
Come on, Ed. You know you miss me.

05:06.723 --> 05:11.311
By the way, Steelers whomped
the Oilers again. Twenty-four to ten.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.063
Some things never change.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.940
Pastorini looked lost out there.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.317
All right, don't forget,

05:17.401 --> 05:20.571
Doc needs you to hook up
to the biosensors again today

05:20.654 --> 05:23.740
and make sure to repair
the aux tank coupling.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.950
Yes, ma'am.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.535
It's all there in the readout.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.245
Yes, ma'am.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.913
Have a good one.

06:51.912 --> 06:56.333
It was Gordon "Gordo" Stevens
who safely piloted the capsule

06:56.416 --> 06:59.127
over 200,000 miles back to Earth,

06:59.211 --> 07:03.882
where he and Mrs. Poole landed safely
in the Pacific just last week.

07:04.466 --> 07:08.011
Gordo Stevens, a real American hero.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.057
Meanwhile,
Ed Baldwin remains at Jamestown,

07:12.474 --> 07:15.185
the lone American on the moon.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.231
And we're here with the crew of Apollo 24,

07:19.314 --> 07:23.360
the astronauts tasked
with bringing him home alive.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.321
Harrison Liu, Deke Slayton

07:26.864 --> 07:29.575
and mission commander Ellen Waverly.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.202
I'm sorry, Ellen Wilson.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.288
Congratulations on your recent wedding.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.873
Thank you.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.084
For those out there who don't know it,

07:39.835 --> 07:44.590
Deke, you were one of the original
Mercury guys, isn't that right?

07:44.673 --> 07:46.758
That's right. Over ten years ago.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.261
But this will be your first time in space.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.471
You were grounded for health reasons,
right?

07:51.555 --> 07:55.767
And you became a bigwig
over at NASA instead.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.187
But now you're cleared to fly,

07:58.270 --> 08:02.524
and I'm sorry, but I gotta ask,
why aren't you commanding this mission?

08:02.608 --> 08:04.902
Ellen Wilson is a fine commander.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.779
I should know. I trained her
and put her in charge of this mission.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.323
I'm sure she is.

08:09.406 --> 08:14.036
But some people feel Danielle Poole's
incident at Jamestown

08:14.453 --> 08:19.082
raises questions about the wisdom
of having women living on the moon

08:19.166 --> 08:20.709
in such harsh conditions.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.046
Accidents happen.
They're not gender-specific.

08:24.796 --> 08:28.342
Danielle Poole is a fine astronaut,
and she handled herself well.

08:28.884 --> 08:32.679
First, Patty Doyle's death.
Now, this girl's injury.

08:32.763 --> 08:38.058
One has to ask, have we gone too far, too
fast, in rushing women into the program?

08:38.143 --> 08:41.104
If anything, Mr. Newsome,
it's taken too long.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.942
I believe women should've been part of
the space program from the very beginning.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.735
Do you feel that way, Deke?

08:47.444 --> 08:50.906
Do you believe women should've been
part of the original Mercury 7?

08:51.615 --> 08:52.866
I believe...

08:54.117 --> 08:56.954
the mission commander is always right.

08:58.497 --> 09:03.544
Harrison, you will be on the moon
with Ellen for weeks, possibly months.

09:03.627 --> 09:07.214
Do you have any concerns
about her physical fitness

09:07.297 --> 09:09.716
to handle living on the moon?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.636
First, I prefer "Harry."

09:13.470 --> 09:15.597
Second,
I just wanna say that the three of us

09:15.681 --> 09:18.100
have been training together
as a crew for months.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.435
And I served with Ellen before
on Apollo 19.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.104
I've come to not only respect,

09:22.187 --> 09:27.276
but to admire Ellen
as mission commander and as an astronaut.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.445
I'm not worried about
serving under her at all.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.615
Well, there you have it.
Solidarity in space.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.328
When Grumman designed
the upgraded LEM for reuse,

09:38.412 --> 09:41.832
the autonomous piloting system
wasn't qualified for far-side operations.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.543
So once you dock with the LSAM,
you'll be performing a system test

09:44.626 --> 09:45.794
of the lunar comm sat.

09:45.878 --> 09:46.879
That's fine.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.132
You guys finally made your minds up
about what our cargo load is gonna be?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.216
We're still working on that.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.426
What's the mystery?

09:52.968 --> 09:56.638
It's basically just 20,000 pounds
of food and gas, right?

09:56.722 --> 09:59.600
24,000 to be exact.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.519
I'm sorry if cargo is not at the top
of our priority list

10:02.603 --> 10:05.647
what with us trying to certify
a Saturn V for flight and all.

10:05.731 --> 10:10.152
Moving on to environmental
control systems, the...

10:10.235 --> 10:12.321
Want to explain to me how
I flew two Gemini missions,

10:12.404 --> 10:15.657
and now I'm backing up a chick,
a geezer and a Korean?

10:16.325 --> 10:17.910
He's Chinese.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.537
Harrison. His family's from China.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.664
Even better.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.793
Remember when it used to be
about merit around here?

10:27.461 --> 10:28.754
How good you were.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.258
Now it's about the color of your skin
or what's down between your legs.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.971
-How's it feel being back at work?
-Good. Real good.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.934
Put me on CAPCOM for Jamestown.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.268
Danielle too.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.772
Figured we'd keep Ed in good spirits,

10:46.855 --> 10:50.567
seeing as we know what he's going
through better than anyone.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.112
So, yeah, things are pretty good.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.913
When you first came in here, Gordo,
do you remember what I told you?

11:04.665 --> 11:08.961
That this only works
if you're completely honest with me.

11:09.044 --> 11:15.968
Okay, for one,
I guess I'm worried about my wife.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.264
Okay. What are you worried about?

11:20.347 --> 11:24.726
Well, I don't know. It's just... lately
she's been acting different toward me.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.811
This is Tracy?

11:25.894 --> 11:26.895
Yeah, Tracy.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.691
I told you she's an astronaut too, right?

11:30.774 --> 11:32.359
Yes, you've mentioned that.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.361
Yeah.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.947
Yup.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.285
You said Tracy's been acting different.
Different how?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.494
Different.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.288
Like...

11:46.999 --> 11:51.503
while I was away, you know,
she rented me an apartment, furnished it.

11:51.587 --> 11:55.924
And whenever I do something wrong,
which lately feels like all the time,

11:56.008 --> 11:58.468
she tells me to go to my apartment.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.347
-Does she want a divorce?
-Oh, no. God, no. Nothing like that.

12:02.431 --> 12:07.060
No. No, she just wants a little space,
I guess.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.938
Well, how do you feel about the idea
of moving out of your own house?

12:10.022 --> 12:11.356
How do I feel?

12:11.899 --> 12:16.695
Not good. That's how I feel. You know.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.908
I don't wanna move out. It's my house.
I wanna be there with my family.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.661
How does she feel about this?

12:25.871 --> 12:30.209
How do you think? She's proud of me.
She's real proud.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.252
How long were you away?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.713
145 days.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.758
You know, Tracy...

12:39.927 --> 12:42.471
She's going up real soon.
Going with Molly Cobb.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.433
Oh, yeah,
the first American woman in space.

12:46.517 --> 12:47.684
Yeah.

12:47.768 --> 12:51.146
Well, that must be quite an honor
flying with her.

12:52.356 --> 12:55.776
Yeah, yeah,
I don't know if Trace sees it like that.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.988
It's gonna be her first time up there.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.699
And her and Molly
didn't exactly get along.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.328
Anyway, they're gonna be repairing
a satellite in Earth orbit.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.579
How long will she be away?

13:07.663 --> 13:11.208
Fourteen days, if things go as planned.

13:12.376 --> 13:16.255
It's just you can plan these things,

13:17.047 --> 13:19.132
you know, years and years,

13:19.216 --> 13:22.636
but, you know, then you get up there...

13:23.679 --> 13:25.055
Well, things can...

13:30.060 --> 13:32.312
They can just fall right apart on ya.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.321
What happened up there, Gordo?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.710
Shouldn't there be a couch in here?

13:55.794 --> 13:59.798
I'm never gonna play with Sidney again.
He's mean and terrible.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.802
Oh, my. Now what has
Sidney done that is so terrible?

14:03.886 --> 14:06.638
-Photosynthesis.
-He said there was no Santa Claus.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.056
So that's why you love chocolate.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.727
-Even after I told him we know Santa--
-Come on. Focus, Anthony.

14:11.810 --> 14:15.647
The Great Oxidation Event is
when the atmosphere first became...

14:16.231 --> 14:18.192
"oxynegedated"?

14:18.734 --> 14:21.069
Correct. And when did it happen?

14:21.153 --> 14:23.447
Like, two billion years ago.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.073
You've got to say the exact number.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.701
I'm sorry, Mommy, but that terrible...

14:27.784 --> 14:31.538
It's 2,500,000,000.

14:31.622 --> 14:32.623
300.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.043
Everyone is entitled to believe in
what they want.

14:36.126 --> 14:40.672
And incidentally, there's a 50/50 chance
you might be wrong.

14:42.508 --> 14:45.552
Poor thing.
It would be such a--

14:45.636 --> 14:47.346
Esmeralda, don't!

14:56.104 --> 14:57.773
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.817
Making your famous popcorn
Christmas decorations.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.570
That's nice.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.616
How was work today?

15:08.992 --> 15:10.160
Good.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.707
You're a real son of a bitch.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.875
What?

15:17.793 --> 15:19.419
Where were you really?

15:20.879 --> 15:23.423
-At work.
-I called JSC.

15:24.091 --> 15:28.720
And they said you left work early.
So, who was it this time, Gordo?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.265
Jesus, Trace, I--

15:31.348 --> 15:33.767
Why you calling JSC checking up on me?

15:33.851 --> 15:35.060
You know...

15:37.104 --> 15:40.899
to think I actually started to feel sorry
for you when you came back.

15:40.983 --> 15:45.654
I thought to myself, "You know what?
Maybe I'm being too hard on him.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.990
Maybe I ought to cut him some slack."

15:49.658 --> 15:53.620
But who is she? What's her name?

15:57.708 --> 15:59.209
Dr. Marsten.

16:01.712 --> 16:05.090
Impressive. You're screwing a doctor.

16:05.174 --> 16:10.012
No, I'm seeing a psychiatrist, Trace.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.266
A man. Dr. Marsten. Okay?

16:19.062 --> 16:21.815
Wow. Really, Gordo?

16:21.899 --> 16:25.944
The shit you come up with
to save your own ass. Unbelievable.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.362
I'm serious.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.409
Trace. Dr. Marsten.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.628
Jesus, Gordo.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.841
A psychiatrist?

16:49.259 --> 16:50.552
Yeah.

16:53.138 --> 16:56.225
Does anyone know? Does--

16:56.308 --> 16:58.685
If NASA finds out, they'll ground you.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.978
I know.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.857
I've been real careful.
I ain't told anyone.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.608
Just you.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.117
Gordo,
what's got you seeing a headshrinker?

17:16.618 --> 17:20.707
I needed to... talk to someone.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.795
But you can talk to me.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.423
Or...

17:31.552 --> 17:32.970
maybe you can't.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.681
Is that the problem?

17:35.764 --> 17:39.393
That... you can't talk to me anymore?

17:39.476 --> 17:41.228
No, I just...

17:44.398 --> 17:47.234
Where did you find this doctor?

17:48.861 --> 17:50.028
Yellow Pages.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.035
Gordo.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.665
Hey.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.880
What happened to you up there?

18:12.926 --> 18:14.636
Nothing happened.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.603
One minute.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.109
Stevens' residence.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.070
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

18:34.740 --> 18:37.868
All right.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

18:41.413 --> 18:42.456
What happened?

18:42.539 --> 18:44.458
Shane's been in an accident.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.127
There's a large amount of regolith
being kicked up.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.837
So they're definitely doing
more construction.

18:48.921 --> 18:51.840
I mean, it was difficult to see
while I was setting up the camera,

18:51.924 --> 18:54.510
but judging from the amount
of dust above the site...

18:56.720 --> 18:58.555
they could be adding a subterranean level.

18:58.639 --> 19:02.226
Well, that fits what we're picking up
via satellite reconnaissance.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.353
Heavy construction underway
at the Soviet base,

19:04.436 --> 19:09.191
but the images have been fairly
inconclusive as to what they're building.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.985
Did you see anything that might
lead you to believe

19:12.069 --> 19:14.696
that this could be of a military nature?

19:14.780 --> 19:18.951
Okay, let's not get out of hand here.
Just because they're...

19:19.618 --> 19:23.330
We've talked about subterranean expansion.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.667
Could be anything.
Natural protection from solar radiation--

19:26.750 --> 19:27.960
What do you think, Captain?

19:28.043 --> 19:30.629
Well, they've definitely been
more aggressive of late, sir.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.716
I've seen tracks from their rover on
several locations around the crater rim.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.885
Well, you'll need to increase
your surveillance effort.

19:36.969 --> 19:39.304
You are our eyes and ears up there.

19:39.388 --> 19:43.684
Can I remind you both that this
is not a military scenario.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.394
The president has been very clear

19:45.477 --> 19:49.106
that this base is about
research and exploration.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.944
Would you excuse us for a moment, Captain?

20:01.952 --> 20:06.540
We are no longer in a research
and exploration world, Harold.

20:07.082 --> 20:10.377
I have the backing of the president
on this, General.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.380
This is NASA, not the Pentagon.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.632
How long's this guy
gonna be stuck up there?

20:15.716 --> 20:18.093
Goddammit, tell me they figured it out.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.304
We need to get him back down here.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.556
This is starting to make me look like
a real limp dick.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.142
Mr. President,
there is a silver lining here.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.604
It's taking the attention off
the Florida situation.

20:28.687 --> 20:32.191
Yes, of course.
I suppose that's a benefit.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.620
Karen.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.916
-Tracy. Hey.
-I got here as fast as I could.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.003
How's he doing?

20:55.839 --> 20:57.716
I-- He's in surgery.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.594
Surgery? Why?

21:01.845 --> 21:04.765
For his head. It's his brain.

21:05.516 --> 21:06.725
His brain?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.268
He just bonked his head really bad.

21:08.352 --> 21:11.396
But the doctor said
the surgery's gonna fix him right up.

21:16.527 --> 21:18.946
Karen,
do you want me to talk to the doctor?

21:19.029 --> 21:21.657
No. No. Shane's gonna be just fine.

21:21.740 --> 21:22.908
He's young.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.785
We have the best doctors
in Texas working on him,

21:24.868 --> 21:26.912
so we have all that going for us.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.830
Yeah, he's a tough kiddo.

21:30.040 --> 21:30.874
Yeah.

21:30.958 --> 21:34.837
Thank you for bringing this. We'll just,
you know, probably be here a day or two.

21:35.379 --> 21:39.967
I packed a change of clothes
for you and Shane.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.176
Toothbrushes.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.179
Your insurance card and your phone book.

21:45.097 --> 21:48.934
Wonderful. Thank you.
I just need to call Marge and let her know

21:49.017 --> 21:52.020
I'm probably not going to make
the bake sale tomorrow.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.442
Hey, hon,
you want me to take care of that for you?

21:58.652 --> 21:59.862
No, it's all right.

24:56.288 --> 24:58.290
It was inside our ice mining operation.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.043
Goddammit.
They're encroaching on our territory.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.836
-Yup.
-This is full encroachment.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.297
What do you think it is, Ed?

25:05.380 --> 25:09.218
Never seen anything like it, sir.
Some kind of surveillance device.

25:11.261 --> 25:12.554
So, what should I do with it?

25:14.848 --> 25:17.226
Nothing. Leave it.

25:17.309 --> 25:21.271
Sir, you really think leaving a Russian
device right next to our mining site

25:21.355 --> 25:22.564
is the right move here?

25:22.648 --> 25:27.361
We do not want an international
lunar incident.

25:27.444 --> 25:30.822
The president wants to avoid
any provocative actions.

25:30.906 --> 25:33.492
Well, they're the ones
being provocative, sir.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.244
And I'm the one alone up here with 'em.

25:35.327 --> 25:38.497
Now, we need to send them a message
that this shit won't fly,

25:38.580 --> 25:40.832
that this is our territory.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.417
I concur.

25:42.501 --> 25:45.671
I understand your frustrations, gentlemen.

25:45.754 --> 25:49.842
And I can assure you I will be talking
to the president about this situation.

25:49.925 --> 25:52.344
But for right now, we do nothing.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.305
Understood?

26:01.812 --> 26:02.896
What time is it?

26:02.980 --> 26:04.064
Early.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.066
Is there any sign of the doctor?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.111
Thank you.

26:12.573 --> 26:15.367
You should go. You have sims today, right?

26:15.450 --> 26:16.910
I can delay it.

26:16.994 --> 26:20.664
No way.
It's your first time in space, Tracy.

26:20.747 --> 26:24.501
I mean, your dream is coming true, right?

26:24.585 --> 26:28.297
You've worked so hard.
So, you go and you finish training.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.675
I'm not leaving.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.847
Yeah?

26:38.557 --> 26:40.058
How was surgery?

26:41.059 --> 26:42.060
Sit.

26:45.981 --> 26:49.651
Typically, I ask for both parents to be
present before I have this conversation.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.069
What conversation?

26:51.153 --> 26:53.113
But due to your extraordinary
circumstances--

26:53.197 --> 26:57.868
Any conversation you need to have,
you have with me right here, right now.

27:00.329 --> 27:02.956
Unfortunately, Mrs. Baldwin,
because of the amount of time that passed

27:03.040 --> 27:06.376
between Shane's accident
and his arrival here at the ER,

27:07.002 --> 27:09.588
he lost a great deal of oxygen
to his brain.

27:12.466 --> 27:15.302
I don't understand. Doctor, is Shane okay?

27:17.304 --> 27:20.557
Shane is brain-dead.
He's being kept alive on a ventilator.

27:22.976 --> 27:26.480
Brain-dead? I've never-- I don't...

27:27.564 --> 27:28.941
I don't know what that means.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.359
It's a relatively new term.

27:30.442 --> 27:33.612
It means that the brain isn't showing
any signs of life on the EEG

27:33.695 --> 27:35.113
even though the heart is still beating.

27:35.197 --> 27:38.242
But isn't it too soon to call it
brain-dead, Doctor?

27:38.325 --> 27:40.244
He hasn't been here for very long.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.329
I'm sorry. I used to be an RN.

27:42.412 --> 27:44.998
I'm just trying to help my friend
understand what's going on here.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.917
We'll repeat the EEG in six hours,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.586
but Shane isn't showing any signs
of brain activity.

27:52.089 --> 27:54.883
-Mrs. Baldwin?
-Yes?

27:54.967 --> 27:58.220
It's extremely unlikely that your son
will ever recover from his accident.

28:01.932 --> 28:05.018
You know, 24 hours ago...

28:06.353 --> 28:09.523
my son was eating
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

28:09.606 --> 28:11.191
and he was talking to me about

28:11.650 --> 28:14.528
which baseball cards
he was gonna trade his best friend.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.865
And now you tell me that his brain is dead

28:17.948 --> 28:21.243
and it's extremely unlikely
that he'll ever recover?

28:22.536 --> 28:24.913
Well, do you know what else
is extremely unlikely?

28:25.622 --> 28:27.791
A man stepping foot on the moon.

28:28.625 --> 28:32.462
And that's where my husband is.
200,000 miles away alone on the moon.

28:32.546 --> 28:36.425
So don't tell me what's
extremely unlikely.

28:38.719 --> 28:40.012
If you don't mind...

28:41.180 --> 28:43.015
I'm gonna get a second opinion.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.642
That's a good id--
That's a great idea, Karen.

28:45.726 --> 28:47.686
-Yeah. You have Deke's number, right?
-I do.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.522
I wanna make sure you understand
the gravity of your son's condition.

28:50.606 --> 28:53.775
If you don't mind, I'd like to have
a private conversation with my friend.

28:54.651 --> 28:55.944
Thank you, Doctor.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.157
I'm sorry.

29:01.116 --> 29:03.660
Dammit. Why didn't I think of this sooner?

29:03.744 --> 29:04.953
It's okay.

29:05.037 --> 29:06.914
Okay, let's call Deke.

29:06.997 --> 29:10.209
Get the number for NASA's neurologist.
He's the best in the country.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.335
Dr. Weddle.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.879
Yes.
Deke will know how to get ahold of him.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.130
Okay.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.177
Trace, I'm gonna go see Shane.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.221
Okay. I'll be right here.

29:22.304 --> 29:23.764
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:28.185 --> 29:30.187
Deke, hi. It's Tracy.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.218
What's his prognosis?

30:01.301 --> 30:05.806
Unclear. Neurosurgeon's on his way
to give him a second look.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.768
We need to tell Ed.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.186
Absolutely not.

30:11.770 --> 30:14.022
Captain Baldwin is up there all alone.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.941
Who knows how he's going to react?

30:16.942 --> 30:18.986
That's a risk we can't afford
to take right now.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.070
I agree.

30:20.571 --> 30:23.365
If it were me up there,
I wouldn't wanna know.

30:23.448 --> 30:27.327
What good is it gonna do telling him
bad news he's got no control over?

30:27.411 --> 30:30.414
He can't change a damn thing
about what's going on down here.

30:30.497 --> 30:34.585
I'm telling you, all of you,
I know Ed, and he'd wanna know.

30:34.668 --> 30:37.462
Well, I don't know if that's
the only consideration here.

30:38.172 --> 30:41.258
There have been several studies on
the effects of psychological turmoil

30:41.341 --> 30:43.594
during high-pressure situations.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.681
We have to calculate
the psychological risks--

30:47.764 --> 30:49.933
This isn't some equation, Margo.
It's his son.

30:51.268 --> 30:54.104
He has a right to know.
He's up there all alone.

30:54.188 --> 30:57.858
Exactly. He's alone,
isolated, with no one to lean on.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.402
-You can't just hide this type of--
-It would be a mistake.

31:00.485 --> 31:01.695
Have you talked to his wife?

31:04.698 --> 31:06.867
Have any of you talked to his wife?

31:15.834 --> 31:18.629
I'm hearing a lot of
different opinions here,

31:18.712 --> 31:20.797
and I'm not saying any of them are wrong,

31:21.507 --> 31:23.467
but she knows Ed best.

31:23.884 --> 31:26.553
It ought to be her call
whether or not we tell him.

31:30.015 --> 31:31.850
Absolutely not.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.939
With all due respect, Karen...

31:38.190 --> 31:41.193
I think Ed deserves to know.
And I know he could handle it.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.737
What would we even tell him at this point,
Deke?

31:44.780 --> 31:47.908
We don't really know what's going on.
The doctors here are all gloom and doom,

31:47.991 --> 31:52.246
but from what Dr. Weddle said on
the phone, Shane could still recover.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.039
He said that?

31:54.581 --> 31:57.084
He said that this brain death thing
is such a new concept

31:57.167 --> 32:00.087
that most of the doctors don't even
really know what they're talking about

32:00.170 --> 32:03.715
and we shouldn't do anything until he gets
here and gets to conduct his own tests.

32:06.134 --> 32:08.011
Well, that sounds like good news.

32:08.428 --> 32:12.182
I think so. And Dr. Weddle's the best
neurologist in the country.

32:13.475 --> 32:16.895
I know my Shane. He can beat this.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.403
Are you sure you don't wanna tell Ed?

32:24.486 --> 32:26.238
I think that he would wanna know.

32:26.321 --> 32:28.323
Not until we know more.

32:30.909 --> 32:33.912
Deke, you wouldn't wanna be locked
alone in a room and know what I know.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.207
You know how Ed gets.

32:41.628 --> 32:44.298
You're scheduled to talk with him soon.
Should we cancel or--

32:44.381 --> 32:45.382
No.

32:45.924 --> 32:47.551
I've never missed a call.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.887
And he would know something's wrong.

32:51.763 --> 32:55.392
I'll figure out what to say later on
when the time comes.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.561
Okay.

32:58.896 --> 33:01.523
I'm heading back to the Cape later today.
Marge is here.

33:01.607 --> 33:02.816
Anything you need...

33:02.900 --> 33:04.193
Anything.

33:06.361 --> 33:07.613
Thank you.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.284
I'll bring him home, Karen.

33:13.285 --> 33:14.494
Godspeed.

33:36.892 --> 33:37.935
It's time.

33:40.562 --> 33:42.022
You gonna be all right?

33:42.105 --> 33:43.357
Of course.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.943
And what about you? You must be exhausted.

33:46.026 --> 33:47.361
I'll be fine.

33:48.237 --> 33:50.781
I know this isn't how you imagined it,
but...

33:52.741 --> 33:54.201
I'm proud of you.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.120
Four more days, Deke.

33:57.204 --> 34:00.415
You are going to the moon.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.569
Sorry I'm late.

34:29.695 --> 34:30.946
Second time.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.156
The bus got held up.

34:34.116 --> 34:37.452
After it dropped me off,
I ran all the way here.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.040
The bus, huh?

34:44.793 --> 34:46.128
What's that?

34:46.712 --> 34:47.754
What?

34:48.255 --> 34:51.257
That necklace.
You weren't wearing that last week.

34:52.134 --> 34:53.427
It's nothing.

34:53.510 --> 34:55.387
It looks like a varsity ring.

34:56.263 --> 34:58.140
Just something a friend gave me.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.603
Did he also give you that hickey
on your neck?

35:04.021 --> 35:07.024
I was really looking forward to today,
Aleida.

35:07.107 --> 35:10.444
To telling you your life
is gonna change in a big way.

35:10.527 --> 35:12.154
But I don't know.
You're making it awfully hard

35:12.237 --> 35:15.282
because now we have to talk about
the fact that you just lied to me.

35:16.116 --> 35:18.285
What do you mean,
my life is going to change?

35:31.340 --> 35:35.177
The Kennedy Math and Science Program.
Is it...

35:35.260 --> 35:36.470
Open it and see.

35:52.736 --> 35:56.031
It says I got in. Am I right?

35:56.114 --> 35:58.116
Is that what this means?

36:04.456 --> 36:08.126
"Accepted into two advanced tracks.

36:08.752 --> 36:11.547
Mathematics and physics."

36:11.630 --> 36:13.215
Yeah, you made the cut.

36:13.298 --> 36:14.299
Oh, my God.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.595
Congratulations.

36:20.138 --> 36:23.475
You're holding a ticket to
the best universities in the country.

36:24.643 --> 36:26.144
I can't believe this is happening.

36:26.228 --> 36:30.691
And you transfer to the Kennedy school
right after first of the year.

36:33.151 --> 36:35.571
-That soon?
-Is that a problem?

36:36.071 --> 36:38.740
No. No, it's just...

36:39.658 --> 36:40.659
What?

36:42.202 --> 36:44.037
It's all the way across town.

36:44.746 --> 36:48.375
I'll have to leave... all my friends.

36:49.001 --> 36:50.294
So you'll make new ones.

36:51.211 --> 36:55.674
Can I finish the year at Ballard
and transfer to Kennedy in the fall?

36:55.757 --> 36:59.344
Aleida,
this is a very competitive program.

36:59.761 --> 37:02.472
Kids from all over the country
are fighting to get in.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.850
There might not be an opening in the fall.

37:04.933 --> 37:08.437
Well, I can go in the spring, maybe.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.273
If that's what you want,
it's fine with me.

37:11.356 --> 37:14.151
We don't have to do this anymore.
You know, you go for it.

37:14.234 --> 37:16.612
You think I don't have a million
other things I could be doing now?

37:16.695 --> 37:18.614
There's a lot going on right now.

37:18.697 --> 37:19.865
I'm sorry.

37:20.282 --> 37:22.784
Ms. Madison, of course,
I wanna keep doing this.

37:22.868 --> 37:24.161
Then you need to focus.

37:25.454 --> 37:28.707
You wanna be an engineer, you're
not gonna have time for anything else,

37:28.790 --> 37:33.420
because you're gonna have to work
ten times harder than the boys.

37:34.630 --> 37:37.633
You don't just have to be on time,
you have to be early.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.219
Put everything else aside.

37:41.637 --> 37:43.722
You have to choose, Aleida.

37:44.389 --> 37:48.060
You have to decide what
you want your life to be.

37:51.104 --> 37:52.105
Hi, Papa.

37:52.189 --> 37:53.315
There you are.

37:54.816 --> 37:56.193
How was the time with Ms. Margo?

37:56.276 --> 37:57.861
Good. It was good.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.781
Good. Well, go wash up. Hurry.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.908
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes.

38:04.868 --> 38:05.953
Okay.

38:17.714 --> 38:20.759
¿Bueno? Sí, un momento.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.136
Aleida!

38:24.096 --> 38:27.140
Aleida! That boy is on the phone for you.

38:32.771 --> 38:33.897
The boy.

38:35.774 --> 38:36.817
Two minutes.

38:37.234 --> 38:38.610
Okay, Papa.

38:40.946 --> 38:42.155
Hello?

38:56.378 --> 38:58.213
Real sorry to hear about your son,
Ms. Baldwin.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.466
Forgive me. Do I know you?

39:01.550 --> 39:04.469
Jerry Biddle, Houston Sentinel.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

39:04.553 --> 39:06.972
Yeah, she absolutely does.
So get the hell outta here.

39:07.055 --> 39:08.932
Just trying to do my job, ma'am.
That's all.

39:09.016 --> 39:10.851
Get the hell outta here.

39:10.934 --> 39:11.977
Out!

39:17.191 --> 39:19.526
Goddamn vultures. You all right?

39:22.613 --> 39:27.034
I should've known it was only a matter
of time before the press got wind of this.

39:27.117 --> 39:29.995
Don't you worry, Karen. I will
call Shorty, and we'll take care of it.

39:31.163 --> 39:32.164
-All right.
-Yeah.

39:32.247 --> 39:33.415
Thank you.

39:34.041 --> 39:38.253
Hey, Karen, hon. You sure you're
still up for a phone call with Ed?

39:40.130 --> 39:41.465
That's now?

39:41.548 --> 39:42.591
Yeah.

39:44.092 --> 39:46.803
Yes, of course. I just wanna--

39:46.887 --> 39:49.097
I'm gonna maybe freshen up my hair
and my makeup.

39:49.181 --> 39:50.516
Do you know where my bag is?

39:50.599 --> 39:51.600
-Sweetheart.
-Yes?

39:51.683 --> 39:53.685
Do you want me to drive you to JSC?

39:54.061 --> 39:56.438
I'll take her. You stay with the girls
and wait for the doctor.

39:56.522 --> 39:58.982
-Are you sure? Tracy, you've done so much.
-I'm sure. Thank you.

39:59.066 --> 40:00.234
Okay.

40:02.110 --> 40:05.864
Thank you, Marge. Look after my boy.

40:08.534 --> 40:09.618
All right.

40:13.956 --> 40:16.583
And the carpenter said
it's going to be an extra $20

40:16.667 --> 40:18.335
just to repair that part of the fence.

40:18.418 --> 40:19.795
Twenty dollars?

40:20.337 --> 40:21.338
I mean--

40:21.421 --> 40:24.341
Mr. Graham refuses to take
any responsibility, of course.

40:24.424 --> 40:25.717
He refuses, huh?

40:25.801 --> 40:29.346
Well, when I get back, that sumbitch
is gonna be trimming back that tree.

40:29.429 --> 40:30.848
I guarantee it.

40:31.682 --> 40:32.891
Of course.

40:33.642 --> 40:34.852
All right.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.564
Hey, how did the game go?

40:41.191 --> 40:42.276
The...

40:43.151 --> 40:44.778
Shane's basketball game.

40:46.822 --> 40:49.449
Yeah, yeah. No, it was good.

40:49.992 --> 40:50.993
Yeah?

40:51.577 --> 40:52.703
Did he play?

40:55.873 --> 40:59.168
In the game, did he--
Did he get time on the court?

41:03.922 --> 41:05.132
Karen, you okay?

41:06.675 --> 41:08.594
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

41:09.845 --> 41:13.390
I'm tired.
I've been fighting this head cold, so...

41:16.852 --> 41:18.353
Shane was...

41:19.313 --> 41:20.606
He had...

41:23.984 --> 41:25.319
He had a good game.

41:25.402 --> 41:26.612
Yeah?

41:27.029 --> 41:29.031
Yeah, he did. He did.

41:29.323 --> 41:30.782
-It was great.
-It was great?

41:30.866 --> 41:34.119
Yeah. I could see he was nervous at first,
of course.

41:34.203 --> 41:38.248
He was biting his lower lip
like he always does...

41:39.750 --> 41:43.337
even though I tell him not to,
but he doesn't listen to me.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.463
No.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.133
It was a home game.

41:49.176 --> 41:53.847
So, he was in his dark jersey. You know,
the one with the stripes on the side?

41:55.307 --> 41:56.433
Yeah.

41:57.851 --> 41:59.603
He looks good in that color.

42:02.022 --> 42:03.941
Wish I had a photo of him wearing it.

42:05.025 --> 42:08.278
I can see him running around on the court
out there while he's playing and...

42:10.239 --> 42:11.823
he's getting so big.

42:13.075 --> 42:14.201
Yeah.

42:14.618 --> 42:18.038
But he still pulls his socks up
to his knees, you know?

42:18.121 --> 42:20.707
Like he's a little boy.

42:21.917 --> 42:23.085
Yeah.

42:23.168 --> 42:24.920
Even though he's not and...

42:28.757 --> 42:30.551
He used to be so tiny, right?

42:30.634 --> 42:31.969
So tiny.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.054
Yeah.

42:34.137 --> 42:36.348
You remember when he was born?

42:37.015 --> 42:42.771
I mean, I could hold him in one hand.

42:43.397 --> 42:44.815
I remember.

42:47.067 --> 42:48.986
He's growing up so fast.

42:49.069 --> 42:50.487
So fast.

42:51.321 --> 42:53.949
And he's always in a hurry
to get somewhere, like he...

42:54.950 --> 42:56.743
doesn't have enough time.

42:58.161 --> 43:01.999
You know, I'm always telling him,
"Just slow down."

43:02.875 --> 43:06.003
You know? "Go easy. Don't be so impatient.

43:08.630 --> 43:10.215
There's plenty of time."

43:12.718 --> 43:14.052
Yeah.

43:15.053 --> 43:16.305
So, who won?

43:19.558 --> 43:20.726
What?

43:21.226 --> 43:22.519
Who won the game?

43:24.980 --> 43:25.981
Well, we did.

43:26.064 --> 43:27.441
Damn right we did.

43:28.317 --> 43:29.318
That's my boy.

43:29.401 --> 43:30.444
Yeah.

43:30.903 --> 43:33.405
Sorry, I'm tired. It's been a long day.

43:33.488 --> 43:35.240
No, it's been a long everything.

43:36.325 --> 43:37.492
Yeah, I know.

43:38.827 --> 43:40.245
Ten more days to go.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.123
-Can't wait.
-Me too.

43:44.249 --> 43:45.334
I love you, Ed.

43:45.417 --> 43:46.919
I love you too, baby.

44:10.776 --> 44:12.778
Did I just do something unforgivable?

44:15.531 --> 44:17.074
You did what you had to do.

44:19.826 --> 44:23.080
If he... you know?

44:26.792 --> 44:28.752
What if he just...

44:28.836 --> 44:31.338
Just drive, okay?

44:32.798 --> 44:34.716
Troubling reports out of Houston today.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.678
We have received information
that while Captain Edward Baldwin

44:37.761 --> 44:39.263
remains stranded on the moon,

44:39.346 --> 44:42.307
his young son has been hospitalized
for an undisclosed accident.

44:42.391 --> 44:43.600
A NASA spokesman said that

44:43.684 --> 44:47.771
the Baldwin family deserves privacy
in this trying moment.

44:48.146 --> 44:49.481
Listen up, everyone.

44:53.443 --> 44:56.864
I know a lot of you are thinking about
Ed Baldwin and his son right now,

44:57.781 --> 45:02.953
but it is important we go about business
as usual and focus on our jobs.

45:03.954 --> 45:06.748
That is the best thing we can do for him.

45:08.959 --> 45:12.171
In discussing it with his family,
the determination has been made

45:12.254 --> 45:15.966
to keep Ed's focus on Jamestown
and the moon, where it needs to be.

45:17.050 --> 45:23.932
So we all need to be very careful in how
and what we communicate with him,

45:24.016 --> 45:27.227
especially now that the press
has got ahold of this.

45:28.061 --> 45:32.900
Nothing is to be said to Captain Baldwin
about the situation down here.

45:34.902 --> 45:37.070
Do either of you have
something you wanna say?

45:39.406 --> 45:41.241
Yeah. Okay.

45:42.451 --> 45:43.660
I don't think it's right.

45:44.745 --> 45:48.290
Me and Dani, we're the ones talking to him
every day. Can't just ask us to lie.

45:48.373 --> 45:50.417
That's exactly what I'm asking you to do.

45:51.251 --> 45:55.088
And if you are unable or unwilling,
then we will find someone who is.

45:55.172 --> 45:56.715
It's not that simple.

45:56.798 --> 45:59.510
We were up there with him for 145 days.
We have been through--

45:59.593 --> 46:00.594
I...

46:02.429 --> 46:03.805
understand.

46:06.058 --> 46:10.604
But this is at the request of his wife.

46:11.438 --> 46:14.566
And we are gonna respect
her wishes in this situation.

46:15.692 --> 46:16.818
Karen wants it this way?

46:22.157 --> 46:24.952
Well... all right.

47:07.035 --> 47:10.622
Houston. It's Jamestown. You there?

47:12.708 --> 47:14.418
Jamestown, Houston.

47:15.377 --> 47:16.628
Reading you loud and clear.

47:17.462 --> 47:20.090
I just got a message
from the Russian base.

47:22.134 --> 47:23.302
Roger that.

47:24.469 --> 47:25.804
What's the message?

47:25.888 --> 47:27.556
It's for me.

47:28.515 --> 47:29.641
It's got my name on it.

47:29.725 --> 47:32.394
It says,
"Deepest sympathies about your son."

47:33.896 --> 47:35.564
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

47:38.734 --> 47:41.612
Maybe something got lost in translation.

47:42.446 --> 47:44.072
You think they heard me talk to Karen

47:44.156 --> 47:47.451
about Shane's basketball game
or something?

47:50.996 --> 47:53.332
I mean, they could be monitoring
our communications.

47:55.459 --> 47:56.835
Could be.

47:57.294 --> 47:59.046
You think they're screwing with me?

48:02.090 --> 48:03.258
Hello?

48:04.468 --> 48:05.677
Right here.

48:07.679 --> 48:08.931
Got me.

48:09.765 --> 48:10.766
I...

48:12.976 --> 48:15.354
I have no idea what they're up to.

48:19.858 --> 48:22.736
"Deepest sympathies about your son."
These Russian bastards.

48:24.154 --> 48:27.366
First, they invade our mining site.
Now they wanna start playing head games?

48:28.075 --> 48:32.037
Wanna distract me? Want me to start
worrying about things back home?

48:32.120 --> 48:35.082
Want me to start worrying about my son?
I mean, my son!

48:39.419 --> 48:41.213
This is low, even for them.

48:42.089 --> 48:43.215
Ed.

48:44.132 --> 48:48.303
We shouldn't start to speculate
on motives here.

48:50.973 --> 48:54.643
I'm heading out to the mining site.
Jamestown, out.

50:14.139 --> 50:16.350
Mrs. Baldwin, I'm Dr. Weddle.

50:17.601 --> 50:19.394
I'm so sorry.

50:20.979 --> 50:25.234
I have checked your son's condition,
and there's nothing more I can do for him.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.444
The amount of brain trauma,

50:27.528 --> 50:30.572
in combination with
the time before treatment,

50:30.656 --> 50:33.325
unfortunately led to total brain death.

51:48.358 --> 51:49.359
No!

51:51.486 --> 51:52.487
No!

52:30.609 --> 52:31.777
Ed.

52:34.446 --> 52:39.076
Ed, are you there? I need you.

52:39.159 --> 52:40.285
Karen?

52:49.253 --> 52:50.712
It's Shane.

53:58.488 --> 54:00.199
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

54:08.790 --> 54:09.958
Let's go inside.

54:11.585 --> 54:12.794
Okay.

54:41.907 --> 54:43.200
Karen?

54:43.283 --> 54:44.284
Yeah.

54:44.701 --> 54:45.786
What are you doing?

54:45.869 --> 54:48.205
I'm getting a head start on
the funeral arrangements.

54:48.789 --> 54:50.832
Ed wants to be buried
at the Naval Academy,

54:50.916 --> 54:54.586
but technically he only qualifies
for interment if he makes flag rank,

54:54.670 --> 54:57.172
and there's nothing in here
about children,

54:57.256 --> 55:01.635
so maybe I just-- I need to ask for an
exception from the superintendent and...

55:01.718 --> 55:03.804
You don't have to
think about this right now.

55:04.429 --> 55:06.181
Funeral's not gonna plan itself.

55:06.723 --> 55:11.728
And if Annapolis is a no, I need to find
a local cemetery that can take Shane,

55:11.812 --> 55:13.063
'cause I don't--

55:13.146 --> 55:14.398
Karen.

55:15.274 --> 55:16.441
I mean...

55:17.943 --> 55:19.403
it's only been a few hours.

55:19.486 --> 55:20.654
Tracy.

55:21.738 --> 55:23.574
If you need to cry, that is fine.

55:24.491 --> 55:26.660
But I need you to do it somewhere else.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.459
This isn't...

55:41.758 --> 55:43.802
Ed, it's Gordo.

55:44.511 --> 55:46.471
Come on. Are you there?

55:48.182 --> 55:49.641
Talk to me, Ed.

55:50.058 --> 55:51.977
Let me know that you're all right.

55:52.561 --> 55:54.605
If you're listening to me...

55:56.857 --> 55:58.775
24 will be there soon.

55:59.401 --> 56:03.322
We're gonna get you back here. Okay?

56:03.405 --> 56:04.823
Thank God, Ed.
