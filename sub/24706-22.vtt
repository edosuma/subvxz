Previously on NYPD Blue:

00:03.830 --> 00:06.000
- Andy SIPOWICZ.
- Oh, Andy.

00:06.167 --> 00:07.877
Bobby Simone, good to meet you.

00:08.086 --> 00:10.255
Get up and get the hell away from her.

00:11.715 --> 00:13.259
Hey!

00:14.385 --> 00:17.222
You worked a long time
with your last partner. Me and you...

00:17.514 --> 00:19.558
...we're not always gonna start
on the same page.

00:19.767 --> 00:22.687
- I hope you're not the sensitive type.
- Sensitive? No, not usually.

00:22.895 --> 00:25.774
- Know he drove for the commissioner?
- I saw that was his last detail.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.943
Takes me 22 years
to make second-grade.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.655
This guy gets there shooing away
squeegee bums.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:45.965 --> 00:48.301
- Hey.
Yeah, the body's in here.

00:48.468 --> 00:52.306
These guys were the first guys here.
I'm just gonna talk to them.

00:53.266 --> 00:54.517
White female, 44.

00:54.684 --> 00:57.271
Those guys found her on their way
for work this morning.

00:57.437 --> 00:59.064
Her name's Louise Shennon.

00:59.231 --> 01:01.109
Someone went after her
with that claw hammer.

01:02.444 --> 01:05.280
- Back again?
- If that idiot boyfriend of Lesniak's...

01:05.447 --> 01:07.825
...gets out of Bellevue,
I'd like to do this to him.

01:08.075 --> 01:10.996
- I'm going to check out the other room.
- Yeah.

01:11.162 --> 01:13.832
- Is the plumbing operational?
- Oh, yeah. Over there.

01:13.999 --> 01:16.461
Thank you very much.

01:19.005 --> 01:21.800
Yeah, I'm Detective Simone.
What do you guys know about this?

01:21.967 --> 01:23.928
A little after 8, we let ourselves in.

01:24.095 --> 01:26.473
Mrs. Shennon gave us a key
when we started last week.

01:26.681 --> 01:29.018
- We found her and called 911.
- Anybody else have a key?

01:29.184 --> 01:31.896
There was this unskilled guy helping her.
I think he had one.

01:32.105 --> 01:33.690
- What's his name?
- He say his name?

01:33.857 --> 01:35.776
I never heard him say anything.

01:37.737 --> 01:39.989
We need statements.
- Go through her purse?

01:40.156 --> 01:42.576
- No, sir. It's over there.
- Where?

01:42.743 --> 01:44.578
- You give the detective your names?
- Yes.

01:44.745 --> 01:46.414
- Yeah, I did too.
- What happened here?

01:46.581 --> 01:48.375
Who are you?

01:48.541 --> 01:52.254
Dr. Peter Shennon. My wife and I
own this building. We're renovating it.

01:52.421 --> 01:55.884
- Where is my wife?
- I'm Detective Simone, Dr. Shennon, sir.

01:56.009 --> 02:00.431
- There's no easy way to tell you this.
- Oh, my God.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.892
Your wife was assaulted today
in the apartment.

02:03.059 --> 02:05.437
She was killed, sir.

02:05.729 --> 02:09.358
- Oh, God. God, Louise.
All right.

02:11.068 --> 02:13.322
Would you like to sit down?

02:16.492 --> 02:19.371
- Who killed her? You know who did this?
No, not yet.

02:19.496 --> 02:21.331
Look, sir, when you feel ready...

02:21.540 --> 02:24.961
...we'd like to ask you some questions
that may give us some help.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.047
Go ahead. God.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.258
Do you know of anyone who might
have been angry?

02:29.425 --> 02:31.844
- Ow!
No.

02:32.011 --> 02:34.973
These paperhangers said
she was working with a handyman.

02:35.140 --> 02:36.934
Would you know his name?

02:37.601 --> 02:41.147
I guess I could get the pay stubs
from the checkbook.

02:41.314 --> 02:43.066
We live just around the corner.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.696
- We really would appreciate that.
Detective Simone.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.407
- Could you get over here?
Please excuse me.

02:50.575 --> 02:52.578
Andy, I'm talking here.
What's the matter?

02:52.745 --> 02:55.873
- I can't stand up.
What? You wanna lie down?

02:56.040 --> 02:58.460
Yeah, and then I want them
to cover me with a sheet.

02:58.627 --> 03:00.713
- Would you just help me up?
- Come on.

03:01.422 --> 03:05.176
- One, two, three, go.
- Oh, wait a minute.

03:05.343 --> 03:10.141
- Here, let your weight go.
- This is Mrs. Shennon's husband.

03:10.308 --> 03:12.978
- I'm a chiropractor. Relax your weight.
- I can't straighten up.

03:13.145 --> 03:14.605
I know.

03:14.855 --> 03:17.733
Oh, brother. Wow.

03:17.942 --> 03:22.281
- All right?
- Yeah, thanks.

03:22.823 --> 03:25.576
I'm sorry for your loss.

04:22.187 --> 04:23.897
Final Adjustment

04:36.746 --> 04:38.999
- Hey, Andy.
- Hey, Roberts. How you doing?

04:39.166 --> 04:41.919
How am I doing?
I got business falling out of my ass.

04:42.045 --> 04:44.923
Andy, I'm finally rolling.
Hey, Mike Roberts. How you doing?

04:45.090 --> 04:47.843
- Bobby Simone.
He used to be on the job.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.430
Yeah?
Yeah, then I got smart.

04:50.597 --> 04:53.392
I went to a living wage.
I'm in security work now.

04:53.559 --> 04:54.894
Right?
- You got a tag...

04:55.060 --> 04:57.897
- ... hanging out of your sleeve.
Messages.

04:58.106 --> 05:02.236
Thanks.
- New suit, Barneys.

05:02.528 --> 05:06.449
Look at the damn price on that, huh?

05:06.950 --> 05:10.162
So you ride with Andy now, huh?

05:10.329 --> 05:12.916
Yeah, we're on a homicide
right now, Mike.

05:13.082 --> 05:17.630
Hey, Bobby, you habla some Espanol?

05:18.005 --> 05:19.507
Yeah, I habla some.

05:19.674 --> 05:22.803
I'm developing strong contacts now
with some Latin American clients.

05:22.969 --> 05:26.307
- You interested in supplemental income-
Thanks, I have my hands full.

05:26.474 --> 05:29.269
Where you going?
- Picking James Martinez up, Andy.

05:29.436 --> 05:32.231
I'm throwing him some hours.
Kid worked a night tour.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.652
I'm probably gonna have to pry
his eyes open with toothpicks.

05:35.818 --> 05:39.823
- Hey, James, ready to roll?
- I was gonna meet you, Mike.

05:40.157 --> 05:42.952
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd pick you up.

05:43.161 --> 05:45.747
Thank the lieutenant if he was around,
express appreciation.

05:45.914 --> 05:47.708
For what's that, Roberts?

05:48.083 --> 05:50.586
I appreciate you okaying James
to work for me, lieutenant.

05:51.296 --> 05:54.716
- I didn't realize he was working for you.
- Excelsior Security.

05:54.883 --> 05:59.305
Yeah, I incorporated. You left my name
off the approval request, huh?

05:59.472 --> 06:02.726
- We should probably get over there.
- Yeah, let's do it.

06:03.227 --> 06:05.188
- Andy, take care of yourself, huh?
- Yeah.

06:05.396 --> 06:08.942
- Bobby, nice to meet you.
- Same here.

06:09.443 --> 06:10.861
Lieu.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.116
- What did you get on that homicide?
White female, 44.

06:15.283 --> 06:19.080
Murder weapon was a claw hammer.
Crime Scene's working that for prints.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.707
Yeah, there were no witnesses.

06:20.873 --> 06:24.211
Two workmen who found her said
a handyman didn't show up today.

06:24.378 --> 06:27.757
We got his name from the woman's
husband. We'll run him through BCl.

06:27.924 --> 06:30.552
We got Medavoy dumping the phones
on the woman's house.

06:30.719 --> 06:33.931
- Any hit off the husband?
- I didn't get anything either way.

06:34.098 --> 06:35.933
He straightened out
Andy's back, though.

06:36.100 --> 06:39.897
- Yeah, the guy was a chiropractor.
Detective Simone.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.319
I'm gonna need a minute here.

06:44.485 --> 06:47.865
I'm gonna get coffee
and run those names.

06:48.031 --> 06:49.700
How you doing, Christy?

06:49.867 --> 06:53.538
- You're busy, I know.
- No, come on back here.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.211
Would you take this, please?

07:02.424 --> 07:06.554
I was putting my son's laundry away
last night, and I found that in a drawer.

07:06.721 --> 07:09.015
Is it loaded?

07:10.142 --> 07:12.311
It is loaded.

07:18.986 --> 07:21.155
It's been about two years now, huh?

07:21.864 --> 07:24.951
- That would make Nicky 10, right?
- Eleven.

07:25.410 --> 07:29.207
He's changed.
I tried talking to him about this...

07:29.374 --> 07:34.046
...and he told me the gun wasn't his
and he was holding it for someone else.

07:34.213 --> 07:36.841
I don't know whether
to believe him or not.

07:37.050 --> 07:41.096
And when I found out that you were
at this precinct, I took it as a blessing.

07:41.513 --> 07:43.641
I don't know what to do.

07:43.808 --> 07:45.602
Do you ever hear from his father?

07:45.769 --> 07:48.438
The last time was right before
your wife passed away.

07:49.356 --> 07:53.319
He called me from Lodi.
He wanted me to wire him $90...

07:53.486 --> 07:59.744
...and I said that I would if he would just
write a card or something to Nick.

07:59.911 --> 08:02.497
- He never sent anything.
- Yeah.

08:03.582 --> 08:06.794
Look, Christy, you know
the normal procedure on this isn't much.

08:06.961 --> 08:10.298
We get Nick in here,
and we fill out a YD card.

08:11.008 --> 08:12.676
There won't be any charges or anything?

08:12.927 --> 08:17.432
- Not unless you want to pursue it.
- No, no.

08:19.476 --> 08:24.608
Nick liked you, and I think he might
listen if you would just talk to him.

08:24.774 --> 08:26.401
Sure, I can do that.

08:26.568 --> 08:28.821
I'll have the officer at his school
bring him in.

08:28.988 --> 08:32.491
Yeah. It's just that I don't
want him to be killed.

08:32.659 --> 08:36.956
- I don't want him to kill anybody else.
- Hey. What school is he in?

08:39.083 --> 08:41.544
He's right here at IS 27.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.964
I'll talk to him. I promise.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.593
Okay?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.016
How have you been doing?

08:53.768 --> 08:56.480
I'm doing all right, Christy.

08:57.481 --> 08:59.609
Thanks for asking.

09:00.735 --> 09:01.778
Thank you.

09:05.616 --> 09:07.159
How long is it gonna be?

09:08.119 --> 09:12.040
No. I'll call back. Thanks.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.712
- Two hours till we can run those names.
What's the problem?

09:15.878 --> 09:19.967
They're purging the BCI computer,
whatever the hell that means.

09:20.134 --> 09:21.260
I got LUDs...

09:21.385 --> 09:23.930
...on the crime-scene phone
and Mrs. Shennon's apartment.

09:24.097 --> 09:27.309
Plus her husband's got a fax line
in their apartment. I dumped that too.

09:27.476 --> 09:30.521
- You got any patterns here?
Have a look.

09:30.730 --> 09:35.027
Call after call on the doctor's line
to a Judith Krasky in Murray Hill.

09:35.152 --> 09:37.238
The latest one was last night.

09:37.405 --> 09:40.408
Maybe the doctor
was getting his end wet.

09:41.076 --> 09:43.412
All right, let's go talk to her.

09:43.579 --> 09:47.917
Listen, guys, I gotta stay close to the
station house for a couple hours.

09:48.251 --> 09:52.381
- What's wrong, Greg?
- Well, I'm trying this high-fiber cereal...

09:52.590 --> 09:53.883
...you know, with dried fruit.

09:54.133 --> 09:58.347
My digestive system
is in complete upheaval.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.101
Excuse me.

10:17.579 --> 10:20.415
- Yes?
- Judith Krasky? New York detectives.

10:20.582 --> 10:23.044
Can we talk to you a minute?

10:25.630 --> 10:27.340
What's it about?

10:27.549 --> 10:30.553
Can we talk inside instead of out here
in front of your neighbors?

10:31.345 --> 10:32.931
Come on in.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.059
I'm Detective SIPOWICZ.
This is Detective Simone.

10:36.226 --> 10:38.145
Hi.

10:40.231 --> 10:43.235
Sorry the place is such a mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

10:45.821 --> 10:48.908
- Could I get you coffee or something?
No, thanks. We're fine.

10:49.075 --> 10:51.119
You do leather craft, Judith?

10:51.245 --> 10:54.081
My brother's staying with me
till he can get a place of his own.

10:54.248 --> 10:56.501
- What's his name?
- Walter.

10:56.668 --> 11:00.130
- Is this about the break-in up in 4C?
- No. We're here on another matter.

11:00.297 --> 11:02.759
Do you know a Dr. Peter Shennon,
chiropractor?

11:02.967 --> 11:04.886
Yeah, sure. I used to work for him. Why?

11:05.095 --> 11:08.641
- His wife was murdered this morning.
- Louise?

11:08.808 --> 11:12.979
Oh, my God, that's horrible.
How'd it happen?

11:13.522 --> 11:16.484
We're not sure.
Have you talked to the doctor lately?

11:16.651 --> 11:19.696
- Yeah, sure. We've talked.
Recently?

11:19.905 --> 11:21.740
Yeah, he just called me last night.

11:21.907 --> 11:24.368
He's looking for a receptionist.
I don't do that anymore.

11:24.535 --> 11:25.954
He thought I might know somebody.

11:26.287 --> 11:30.918
So whenever you and him talk,
it's always business-related?

11:31.085 --> 11:34.923
No, we talk socially. I mean, since
I worked for him, we stayed friends.

11:35.090 --> 11:38.677
Like after the opera, him and the missus
would stop by for a little sherry?

11:38.844 --> 11:41.264
- I don't get what you mean.
- There's 80 calls to you...

11:41.431 --> 11:44.101
...in the past month
from a line in the doctor's house.

11:44.309 --> 11:46.145
- So?
- Either you were screwing the doctor...

11:46.312 --> 11:48.565
- ... or you were screwing his wife.
- That's disgusting.

11:48.731 --> 11:51.234
Judith, nobody wants to intrude
on your personal life.

11:51.401 --> 11:54.906
A woman was murdered. We're just
trying to figure out how it happened.

11:55.072 --> 11:58.118
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
but I can't help you.

11:59.036 --> 12:01.539
Excuse me now.

12:10.007 --> 12:13.094
- She was definitely doing the doc.
- Yeah, well, that makes him horny.

12:13.261 --> 12:14.721
I don't know if it makes him wrong.

12:14.888 --> 12:17.516
You think brother Walter
picked up his handicraft in the joint?

12:17.683 --> 12:20.478
The thought crossed my mind.

12:34.370 --> 12:37.082
- You ready for this? You feel okay?
- Yeah, I feel good.

12:37.249 --> 12:39.376
Keep in mind the class of people
you're dealing with.

12:39.543 --> 12:41.713
Don't be holding your hand out
like some bellhop.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.799
Hello.

12:45.467 --> 12:48.805
- You're young for a detective.
- Well, he looks a lot younger than he is.

12:48.971 --> 12:50.849
Don't I wish I could say that, right?

12:51.016 --> 12:53.769
I'm 28 years old.
I got my shield last year.

12:53.936 --> 12:58.233
James is a very hard worker, Mr. Beltran.
He is also very respectful.

12:58.775 --> 13:00.360
Hola, Papa.

13:00.527 --> 13:01.570
Leticia.

13:05.074 --> 13:08.662
My daughter Leticia, she came
from Skidmore College to see her papa.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.207
- Hi, I'm James Martinez.
- Nice to meet you.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.084
- Mike Roberts.
How do you do?

13:13.251 --> 13:15.546
James is gonna take
very good care of you.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.008
- You won't even know I'm around.
- That's right. We're very discreet.

13:20.677 --> 13:23.597
Leo, welcome.
I present my daughter Leticia.

13:23.931 --> 13:26.517
- Leticia, my attorney, Mr. Vitale.
- How do you do?

13:26.684 --> 13:29.646
Mr. Vitale, Mike Roberts.
Pleasure to know you, sir.

13:29.813 --> 13:33.442
- And James Martinez I've already met.
- How's it going, Mr. Vitale?

13:33.609 --> 13:37.197
Please excuse Mr. Vitale and I.
Ticia, enjoy your afternoon.

13:37.364 --> 13:40.034
Will I see you for dinner?
- I'm planning on it.

13:40.201 --> 13:42.286
I'll be in the next room
if you need me.

13:42.495 --> 13:45.749
- James, check in with me regularly.
Okay.

13:45.916 --> 13:48.043
Here we go.

13:49.921 --> 13:51.631
- What do you like to be called?
- James.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.134
James, could you hold this, please?

13:54.343 --> 13:56.178
For the last six weeks,
I've been at school...

13:56.345 --> 13:59.391
...in the middle of nowhere, with nothing
to do but watch the leaves change.

13:59.558 --> 14:04.731
Now, I've got a couple days in the city,
and I plan to enjoy myself.

14:04.897 --> 14:07.067
My responsibility's keeping you
out of harm's way.

14:07.234 --> 14:09.445
Beyond that, you're on your own.

14:09.611 --> 14:12.532
As long as we understand each other.

14:23.337 --> 14:26.465
Those name-checks came in from BCl.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.177
The paperhangers and the carpenter
are clean...

14:29.344 --> 14:34.225
...but this handyman, Victor Ugo,
did 14 years for killing his mother.

14:34.392 --> 14:37.062
- They got a last-known?
- Yeah. He's got an apartment in Queens.

14:37.228 --> 14:40.357
If we wanna pick him up,
his parole guy says he'd meet us there.

14:40.524 --> 14:43.736
- Also this Walter Krasky you asked for...
Yeah?

14:43.903 --> 14:47.491
- ... did three years for armed robbery.
Detective.

14:47.700 --> 14:51.120
The officer from that school across
the street has a Nick Williamson...

14:51.287 --> 14:53.498
- ... you asked to see?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, Donna.

14:53.665 --> 14:56.335
I'm gonna have to meet you guys there.

14:56.460 --> 15:00.590
This Nick is the kid of a woman used to
live in our building over in Brooklyn.

15:00.757 --> 15:03.803
- She was really good to my wife.
- Yeah. What did the kid do?

15:03.969 --> 15:06.556
Eleven years old,
the mother finds a gun in the drawer.

15:06.723 --> 15:08.475
She wants me to talk to him.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.227
- Medavoy.
Yeah?

15:10.394 --> 15:14.858
- How's your stomach?
- Better. Yeah, yeah, it's under control.

15:14.983 --> 15:17.110
Come with me.
Let's go sit on this guy's house.

15:17.277 --> 15:21.658
- Here's the address.
- Thanks. I'll meet you guys there.

15:22.826 --> 15:27.123
Fifteenth Squad.
Holding on line three.

15:29.501 --> 15:32.212
Hey, sarge, Detective Simone.

15:33.172 --> 15:35.967
Yeah,
who we got in the pens downstairs?

15:36.134 --> 15:38.929
What beefs are they in for?

15:44.853 --> 15:46.980
Hey.
Thanks very much for bringing him over.

15:47.189 --> 15:49.567
No problem, detective.

15:54.865 --> 15:59.621
- How's it going there, Nick?
- Great. Cop takes me out of school.

15:59.787 --> 16:03.751
- You know why you're here?
- Yeah.

16:04.752 --> 16:07.839
You remember you and your mom
used to live over in Brooklyn?

16:08.006 --> 16:11.385
You and me, we used to go up
on the roof there and fly the pigeons.

16:11.593 --> 16:16.558
- We'd talk.
- Yeah, look. That gun ain't mine.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.520
- I'm trying to help you.
- Who do you think you are, my father?

16:19.687 --> 16:23.191
No, I'm not your father,
but I'd like to be your friend.

16:23.358 --> 16:27.363
- You wanna give that a try?
- I got friends.

16:27.530 --> 16:29.866
I don't rat out.

16:31.159 --> 16:33.120
Get up, Nick.

16:33.287 --> 16:35.331
Get up.

16:39.586 --> 16:42.131
Let me show you something over here.

16:44.592 --> 16:47.387
- How you doing?
- Good.

16:53.770 --> 16:55.647
Come on.

17:03.657 --> 17:07.412
See this guy right here?
He's on a laughing jag.

17:07.578 --> 17:10.040
Really tough guy, yeah.

17:10.248 --> 17:13.544
He used a knife to take a purse
from an old woman.

17:13.711 --> 17:16.005
He's laughing because he's going away
for eight years.

17:16.172 --> 17:19.510
You know what? It don't bother him.

17:19.675 --> 17:21.721
Who's that?

17:22.096 --> 17:24.265
This is Nick.

17:24.974 --> 17:27.144
You putting him in here?
What happened to juvie?

17:27.353 --> 17:30.148
- No, just showing him around.
- What do you want him to see?

17:30.314 --> 17:32.692
- Put him in here and turn the lights out.
Yeah.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.362
Shut your mouth.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.452
All right, in there.

17:40.619 --> 17:45.041
- You can't put me in there. It's not legal.
- Come on.

17:46.584 --> 17:48.545
Sit down.

17:50.172 --> 17:54.761
Now, Nick,
these punks who gave you that gun...

17:54.928 --> 17:57.181
- ... if that's what happened.
- That's what happened.

17:57.347 --> 18:00.601
They're gonna end up right here
on their way to Rikers.

18:00.768 --> 18:02.228
Now, you wanna go this route?

18:03.897 --> 18:05.524
That gun's for protection.

18:05.691 --> 18:08.778
Half the kids in school,
they hate us because we're white.

18:08.945 --> 18:11.198
They all got guns.
We gotta protect ourselves.

18:11.364 --> 18:13.617
- Don't sing somebody else's song.
- Think I'm lying?

18:13.784 --> 18:17.080
- Who are you holding that gun for?
- No, I'm not ratting on anyone.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.001
I'm in a lot of trouble
because I can't give that gun back.

18:21.544 --> 18:24.130
Give me the guy's name
you got that gun from...

18:24.297 --> 18:27.843
...and I promise he's not
gonna give you any trouble.

18:28.552 --> 18:30.513
No.

18:32.932 --> 18:35.269
- I'm gonna take an ass kicking.
- You have yourself to blame.

18:35.436 --> 18:37.855
You have a choice.
I'm trying to treat you like a man.

18:38.064 --> 18:40.775
You're a scumbag.

18:43.070 --> 18:45.323
All right, Nick.

18:46.532 --> 18:48.410
Stand up.

18:49.745 --> 18:52.873
You know you can be at the beginning
or you can be at the end of this.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.293
It's up to you.

18:56.837 --> 18:58.797
Those are my numbers.

18:58.964 --> 19:01.968
- What if I don't want your numbers?
- Then you throw the card away.

19:02.135 --> 19:04.888
Don't you do it in front of me!

19:05.097 --> 19:08.643
And don't you ever swear at me again,
you understand me, Nick?

19:23.744 --> 19:27.791
So you wanna go back and show
your dad all the nice stuff you bought?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.835
He won't be in the mood to notice.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.755
I never heard that expression,
what that one saleslady said:

19:32.881 --> 19:36.385
"They'll be wearing this
five minutes from now. "

19:37.303 --> 19:39.973
When I was little
and we'd come to New York...

19:40.139 --> 19:42.350
...my nanny used to bring me
to this park.

19:42.517 --> 19:44.311
Your family lived here
and in Costa Rica?

19:44.478 --> 19:46.439
But mostly Costa Rica.

19:46.564 --> 19:49.276
But my father came back and forth
for business so much...

19:49.442 --> 19:53.072
- ... he just kept that apartment.
- I guess bankers go all over, huh?

19:54.282 --> 19:57.953
James, when we met
at the apartment...

19:58.120 --> 20:01.540
...that lawyer my dad was talking to,
he acted as if he knew you.

20:01.749 --> 20:04.252
Mr. Vitale defended
one of my first collars as a detective.

20:04.544 --> 20:07.464
- I've read about him.
- Yeah, he's one of the top guys.

20:07.631 --> 20:11.052
He put me through the hoops
when I testified in court.

20:14.056 --> 20:15.641
My father's in trouble.

20:16.058 --> 20:19.145
- Just because he's talking to a lawyer?
- No, something's going on.

20:19.312 --> 20:23.442
He's upset and nervous. I mean,
I know you can't tell that, but I can.

20:24.443 --> 20:25.737
He seemed very polite.

20:27.113 --> 20:30.159
He called me at school last week
and told me not to come to the city...

20:30.326 --> 20:32.829
...because his schedule had gotten
overbooked.

20:32.995 --> 20:36.124
I haven't seen him in a year, and
he doesn't want to see his daughter?

20:37.042 --> 20:39.587
Leticia, if your dad's in a jam,
he's taking care of it.

20:39.754 --> 20:41.381
His attorney's one of the best.

20:41.548 --> 20:45.302
That guy I arrested was guilty as hell.
Vitale got him off.

20:46.095 --> 20:48.765
Not that's even why your dad
is talking to him.

20:48.973 --> 20:51.727
It must be pretty bad
if he won't tell me.

20:57.651 --> 20:59.570
I'm sorry. This isn't your problem.

21:01.030 --> 21:04.659
Hey, look, I thought
you had a job to do down here.

21:04.826 --> 21:08.831
It's to have a great time.

21:10.082 --> 21:11.334
Let's go home.

21:18.384 --> 21:20.220
All right, come on.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.014
Sit down, Victor.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.517
You want smokes, something?
- No, I don't.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.020
Know what you're here for?
- No.

21:27.228 --> 21:29.898
You were working for Louise Shennon.
Victor, is that right?

21:30.357 --> 21:33.945
Yeah, mostly finishing work.

21:34.362 --> 21:37.532
- Did you work today?
- No, I didn't feel good.

21:37.699 --> 21:39.034
- You didn't go to work?
- No.

21:39.201 --> 21:41.579
Mrs. Shennon
was murdered today, Victor.

21:41.788 --> 21:43.081
I didn't kill her.

21:43.248 --> 21:45.292
You don't seem too surprised
she was murdered.

21:45.459 --> 21:48.963
If I'd have killed her,
I'd be on a boat to Brazil now.

21:49.130 --> 21:50.131
Really?

21:50.298 --> 21:53.427
When you killed your mother, you hung
around the house for two days.

21:53.552 --> 21:55.721
I didn't do this one.

21:55.930 --> 22:00.978
I'm an emotional person.
I have to be angry to kill someone.

22:01.145 --> 22:04.482
I had no anger at all
toward Mrs. Shennon.

22:04.649 --> 22:06.860
Well, maybe she did something
to piss you off.

22:07.027 --> 22:12.533
- She criticized your work...
- No, I liked working for her.

22:14.035 --> 22:17.665
I did 14 years up there.
I don't want to go back.

22:17.832 --> 22:21.086
I only had one mother.

22:21.252 --> 22:25.132
I killed her, and that's done with.

22:25.967 --> 22:29.179
How did you get this job
working for Mrs. Shennon, Victor?

22:29.346 --> 22:32.600
A guy I knew upstate,
I called him when I got out...

22:32.766 --> 22:38.690
...and asked him about jobs, and he
showed me an ad in the PennySaver.

22:38.899 --> 22:45.073
- What was his name?
- Walter. Walter Krasky.

22:46.033 --> 22:48.160
- You been in touch with him since then?
- No.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.912
You sure?
- No.

22:55.669 --> 22:58.089
So now what are you gonna do to me?

22:58.256 --> 23:02.386
You're gonna have to hang around here
for a while until we straighten this out.

23:05.181 --> 23:07.851
Think it's a coincidence?
Mistress's brother puts this twitch...

23:08.018 --> 23:10.938
- ... in that apartment?
- He's not the murder-for-hire type.

23:11.105 --> 23:14.401
Maybe he's more like the type you frame
when you do a murder yourself.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.696
Get your sister out of her dead-end
career as a second-string bang.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.032
These are questions
we'll wanna ask Walter.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.242
Oh, yeah.

23:34.342 --> 23:36.678
- Hey, James. How's it going?
Okay, Greg.

23:36.845 --> 23:39.598
- A little tired.
- Did you get any sleep at all?

23:39.848 --> 23:43.311
I got a security gig. I caught a
couple hours before my night watch.

23:43.478 --> 23:47.775
Yeah, so how's that job going?
How do you like working for Roberts?

23:47.941 --> 23:50.862
Oh, she's a really nice girl,
that girl I'm watching.

23:51.029 --> 23:55.534
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, that Leticia Beltran, very nice.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.829
She goes to Skidmore College,
upstate New York.

23:58.538 --> 24:02.543
- That's up in Saratoga Springs, right?
- Yeah, I think that's right.

24:03.168 --> 24:06.714
Yeah, Marie and I got lost
on our way to an outdoor concert.

24:06.881 --> 24:08.466
We asked directions at that college.

24:08.633 --> 24:10.636
Oh, yeah?

24:11.136 --> 24:14.015
I think this girl's father may be
in some kind of trouble.

24:14.182 --> 24:17.102
- Oh, yeah, why do you say that?
- Well, she's concerned about him.

24:17.269 --> 24:20.231
You know. It looks like he's involved
with this Leo Vitale.

24:20.439 --> 24:22.650
- The criminal lawyer.
- The guy working for the father...

24:22.859 --> 24:25.738
...I saw him carrying a piece,
some guy named Arturo.

24:25.904 --> 24:29.033
- The father's a Central American banker.
- Yeah.

24:29.701 --> 24:32.120
I guess he's eligible to be
in a little trouble.

24:32.329 --> 24:35.041
Yeah, depending on depositors, yeah.

24:35.207 --> 24:39.504
Anyways, this girl is awfully nice.

24:39.671 --> 24:43.217
- Yeah. You mentioned that.
- Uh-huh.

24:48.307 --> 24:49.850
Sit down.

24:50.017 --> 24:53.229
- Your sister like her apartment, Walter?
- I guess she likes it all right.

24:53.396 --> 24:55.691
- It's small, though, isn't it?
I don't know.

24:55.899 --> 24:57.902
- I guess.
She's up for a new one?

24:58.069 --> 25:00.113
With the doctor's wife dead?

25:00.572 --> 25:03.784
- Oh, wait, guys.
- It must be a lucky break for her, right?

25:03.993 --> 25:06.287
- However it happened.
- I don't know how it happened...

25:06.454 --> 25:08.665
- ... and neither does she.
- Walter.

25:08.832 --> 25:12.753
- You know a guy named Victor Ugo?
- The guy who wrote the musical?

25:13.087 --> 25:16.466
This guy spells it U-G-O,
and he knows you from upstate.

25:16.716 --> 25:21.973
Right, Ugo, yeah.
I've never heard him use the "Victor. "

25:22.140 --> 25:24.559
He says you got him a job
with the doctor's late wife.

25:24.768 --> 25:27.438
He got out and gave me a call.
He was looking for work.

25:27.646 --> 25:30.483
I showed him an ad
in the PennySaver is all.

25:30.650 --> 25:34.613
You show some half-wacko,
who just did 14 years for murder...

25:34.780 --> 25:38.493
...a help-wanted ad from a woman
who you want to get dead?

25:38.660 --> 25:40.662
That's just too small a world, Walter.

25:40.829 --> 25:43.624
You're putting a really ugly turn
on me doing a favor for a guy.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.752
You know what?
You're at ground zero, Walter.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.171
You got bigtime motive. You got access.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.342
And we got you putting
a known murderer at the crime scene.

25:51.509 --> 25:54.012
I don't believe how this stuff
is always happening to me.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.348
Yeah, sit there feeling sorry for yourself.

25:56.515 --> 25:59.852
Keep circling the bowl
till the suction takes you down.

26:00.019 --> 26:03.523
You piece of crap. Now, either you hired
this guy to kill the doctor's wife...

26:03.690 --> 26:07.779
...or you set him up and killed her
looking for some financial kissy-kiss...

26:07.945 --> 26:10.657
...once your sister and the doc
tie the knot!

26:11.366 --> 26:15.288
I had a great franchise opportunity,
fat-free doughnuts.

26:15.455 --> 26:17.833
I asked Dr. Shennon
if he could lend me the money.

26:17.999 --> 26:21.879
One way and another,
he says if I kill someone, I get it...

26:22.088 --> 26:25.550
- ... is how the conversation wound up.
- If you killed his missus?

26:26.093 --> 26:29.597
He didn't say. I turned him down flat.
I didn't even want to talk about it.

26:29.764 --> 26:31.432
But you did give him a referral?

26:31.975 --> 26:35.479
I might have said that Ugo
was in touch with me maybe.

26:35.646 --> 26:38.316
And the doctor
might have said something...

26:38.483 --> 26:42.154
- ... about showing him his wife's ad?
- I haven't committed a crime here, okay?

26:42.321 --> 26:44.824
I did not get paid dime one
from anybody.

26:44.991 --> 26:47.577
You failed to report
a criminal solicitation, Walter.

26:47.744 --> 26:51.332
That's a parole violation.
If we want you in, you're going.

26:52.959 --> 26:56.004
All I wanted was a
lousy doughnut franchise.

26:56.171 --> 26:58.674
You're gonna wear a wire
on Dr. Shennon, Walter.

26:58.841 --> 27:02.470
No, I'll screw it up. I'm a screwup.

27:02.637 --> 27:03.930
Get Judy to do it.

27:04.097 --> 27:07.768
She's the one he's got a thing for, Judy.

27:12.232 --> 27:14.527
The other way is bringing in the doctor
and lean on him.

27:14.693 --> 27:17.947
He would lawyer-up in 10 seconds.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.866
We need to stay sweet
with Dr. Shennon.

27:20.033 --> 27:22.828
Detective Simone,
Officer Lenahan on line two.

27:22.995 --> 27:25.623
Thanks.
- I'll tell Fancy about wiring his sister.

27:25.790 --> 27:28.961
We ought to set up on her place.
I don't think we want her body miked.

27:29.128 --> 27:32.966
Yeah, her body might get a little busy.

27:34.676 --> 27:36.637
Simone.

27:37.805 --> 27:40.684
You got the name of the kids
who beat him?

27:43.687 --> 27:46.232
Bruce, John.

27:46.399 --> 27:50.320
M- A-C-E? Like the chemical?

27:52.406 --> 27:54.325
All right, thanks very much. Thank you.

27:56.536 --> 27:59.206
- Detective.
Dr. Shennon, how's it going?

27:59.373 --> 28:00.958
Detective.
Hi.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.211
- How's your back?
- It's okay, a little stiff.

28:03.378 --> 28:05.964
- I appreciate your helping.
Not at all.

28:06.131 --> 28:08.092
How can we help you?

28:08.259 --> 28:11.388
I hope you understand
I want to monitor what's going on.

28:11.554 --> 28:13.140
- Of course.
- Yeah. Have a seat.

28:13.307 --> 28:15.309
Are there any developments?

28:15.476 --> 28:17.770
We won't be doing you
any favors, doc...

28:17.937 --> 28:22.234
...by telling you something prematurely,
then it didn't pan out.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.945
Are you questioning someone?

28:24.821 --> 28:27.908
Yeah, we can say at this time
that we are talking to someone.

28:28.575 --> 28:31.787
Was that information helpful,
in terms of that handyman Ugo?

28:31.996 --> 28:35.584
- We can say yes, it was.
We can tell you...

28:35.792 --> 28:38.379
...this Ugo did do time
for a previous murder.

28:38.713 --> 28:40.798
You're kidding.

28:40.965 --> 28:42.509
Oh, my God.

28:42.676 --> 28:44.887
Let us look into this for a while, okay?

28:45.054 --> 28:47.515
And hopefully we'll have something
to tell you.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.726
All right, all right.

28:49.893 --> 28:52.062
- Thanks for being cooperative.
- No problem, doc.

28:52.229 --> 28:53.606
Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:53.814 --> 28:56.192
Thank you.
And you'll keep me informed?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.195
You bet.

29:03.117 --> 29:06.705
- Fancy okay the wire on her place?
- Yeah.

29:06.872 --> 29:09.458
Want to look in on Norman Bates?

29:17.802 --> 29:19.345
How's it going, Victor?

29:19.512 --> 29:22.099
I don't wanna be in here.
- You hang tight, Victor.

29:22.266 --> 29:23.851
This may come out all right.

29:24.018 --> 29:27.272
Is it because somebody saw me
at that apartment yesterday?

29:27.439 --> 29:30.067
Is that why you're holding me?

29:30.234 --> 29:31.736
Something on your mind, Victor?

29:32.653 --> 29:35.615
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

29:35.866 --> 29:40.913
I wasn't sick yesterday. No.
I was there. I showed up for work...

29:41.080 --> 29:44.710
...unlocked the door,
she was lying there, dead.

29:44.877 --> 29:46.712
Had to be somebody else with a key...

29:46.879 --> 29:50.634
...or someone followed her in
from the street.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.094
But it wasn't you?

29:52.261 --> 29:56.975
No, you see, I wouldn't kill
someone I liked. No.

29:57.142 --> 30:00.270
The only person I killed
was my mother.

30:06.778 --> 30:08.572
I don't like the idea.

30:08.739 --> 30:12.410
Judith, we'll set up a couple
of microphones and a camera in here.

30:12.577 --> 30:15.956
You and Dr. Shennon,
you just talk, and we'll listen.

30:16.123 --> 30:18.417
Don't you wanna
keep your brother out of prison?

30:18.584 --> 30:21.338
You bastards, Walter was trying
to straighten his life out.

30:21.463 --> 30:24.425
Hey, if Walter goes back in,
it's because you wouldn't help him.

30:24.592 --> 30:27.971
I never looked for any of this.
I was satisfied exactly how things were.

30:28.138 --> 30:29.639
Between you and Dr. Shennon?

30:29.848 --> 30:31.976
I liked her.
When I was his receptionist...

30:32.143 --> 30:36.731
- ... she used to get me little presents.
- Well, that phase is over with, Judith.

30:37.149 --> 30:39.735
- He's smart, you know.
What? Walter?

30:39.902 --> 30:42.363
- Maybe if you get to know him better.
- I don't mean Walter.

30:42.655 --> 30:44.366
You mean the doctor?

30:44.533 --> 30:47.203
Yeah, he's smarter than me.

30:47.411 --> 30:49.706
There's plenty of things
you're smart about.

30:49.872 --> 30:52.626
Like in the area that keeps him
coming back.

30:52.751 --> 30:56.214
And I'm just supposed to get him
to say who killed his wife?

30:56.422 --> 30:58.299
Yeah, that would be perfect.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.335
- Police! Halt!
No! No!

31:43.646 --> 31:45.398
Son of a bitch!

31:45.524 --> 31:49.612
James! James! Oh, God!

32:05.590 --> 32:07.884
Think she'll get the doc to go?

32:08.051 --> 32:11.514
Depends. Is he chatty
when his willie's up?

32:13.391 --> 32:15.936
I'm kind of hoping
that Victor wasn't involved.

32:16.103 --> 32:21.484
Yeah, Victor seems like an okay guy,
so long as you're not his mom.

32:23.236 --> 32:25.531
There's our boy.

32:30.745 --> 32:32.873
Hi, baby.

32:35.793 --> 32:38.046
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared.

32:38.421 --> 32:40.883
Scared of what?

32:41.550 --> 32:45.180
Judith, a maniac killed Louise.
They're searching for the man...

32:45.347 --> 32:46.932
...and they're gonna find him.

32:47.099 --> 32:50.728
You sure?
- I'm sure of what? Of course I am.

32:50.853 --> 32:52.355
Cops know about you and me.

32:54.232 --> 32:55.734
Why do you say that?

32:55.859 --> 32:58.613
They came and talked to me.
They found my number in some records.

32:58.821 --> 33:00.865
- Here we go.
Did they talk to Walter?

33:01.032 --> 33:04.411
Luckily, they didn't.
That's all he needs right now.

33:06.873 --> 33:10.043
Nothing we've done
has ever been a crime.

33:10.544 --> 33:13.673
You know, in a case like this,
the police look at everyone.

33:13.881 --> 33:17.886
You know, once they find the man
who did it, the investigation ends.

33:18.178 --> 33:21.474
And they found a man. I helped them.

33:21.641 --> 33:24.311
- What do you mean "helped them"?
I helped them.

33:24.519 --> 33:27.523
I told them about a man that worked
with Louise in our building.

33:27.690 --> 33:30.986
A murderer. He killed his mother.

33:31.152 --> 33:34.907
You think he did it?
- They think so. God, you look great.

33:36.075 --> 33:39.329
- Your hand's cold.
- What? What?

33:39.496 --> 33:42.666
Well, how do you know
this guy killed Louise?

33:43.793 --> 33:45.879
It doesn't matter.
It's not a problem for us.

33:46.046 --> 33:48.674
Yeah, it's a problem for me.
The cops think I did it.

33:48.966 --> 33:51.052
- I'm scared.
- What are you scared of?

33:51.260 --> 33:53.638
You could trust me.

33:55.182 --> 33:59.145
- Not if we have secrets.
- What secrets?

33:59.562 --> 34:01.147
Did you get him to do it?

34:01.523 --> 34:06.153
Could be dangerous. He could talk.

34:08.197 --> 34:11.827
- I don't want anything to happen to you.
- Come on, say it wasn't Victor.

34:11.952 --> 34:14.914
He's not gonna tell
them anything. He didn't do it...

34:15.081 --> 34:18.335
- ... but they think he did.
- Attaboy, doc.

34:18.502 --> 34:22.172
You horny devil.
- You don't know what it was like...

34:23.091 --> 34:27.513
...leaving you and going to her.
I couldn't even touch her.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.849
Her mouth.

34:30.141 --> 34:32.393
The smell of her.

34:32.643 --> 34:37.190
Everything. After you,
how could I want anyone else?

34:40.070 --> 34:43.407
You did it. You killed her for me.

34:43.574 --> 34:48.205
For you, yes. For you.

34:48.371 --> 34:51.542
That dirty bitch. I killed the dirty bitch.

34:51.751 --> 34:54.879
- I killed...
Say goodbye, doc.

34:57.383 --> 35:00.887
Look at this.
I got blood and brains all over me.

35:01.054 --> 35:03.849
All I need now is a pink pillbox hat.

35:06.227 --> 35:08.438
That Colombian give it up?
He say why he shot him?

35:08.605 --> 35:10.440
No, he's not saying anything.

35:10.607 --> 35:13.944
That's the way they operate, you know.
You could rip their tongues out.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.616
I'm only glad
that we apprehended the guy.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.160
It was my understanding
Martinez did that.

35:20.369 --> 35:23.122
- That what James said?
- No, he's still giving his statement.

35:23.247 --> 35:24.874
It's what the daughter said.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.127
Tell you the truth,
the daughter's sweet on him.

35:27.294 --> 35:29.296
Hey, I'm not trying
to take credit for this.

35:29.463 --> 35:31.925
Medavoy will get to you in a minute.

35:34.511 --> 35:37.640
You guys steal that step-over-
toe-hold move from the wrestler...

35:37.849 --> 35:40.226
..."Strangler" Ed Lewis,
or was he before your time?

35:40.393 --> 35:43.606
You think you're funny. This idiocy
will end when my lawyer arrives.

35:43.772 --> 35:46.234
- I was lying. I wanted to get laid.
- Take him to Booking.

35:46.401 --> 35:47.444
You okay?
- Yes.

35:47.652 --> 35:49.821
Back kicking up again, detective?

35:50.030 --> 35:53.034
I'd say it's a degenerative disc.
Get used to the pain.

35:53.242 --> 35:55.662
Maybe I can take my mind off it
thinking about you...

35:55.829 --> 35:59.750
...up there in Ossining,
getting acupuncture up your dirt chute.

36:05.799 --> 36:08.553
Hey, Mike, I need a second with you.

36:10.221 --> 36:11.890
How you holding up?

36:12.099 --> 36:15.478
- I want some answers from you.
- James, the last answer I had was...

36:15.645 --> 36:18.148
...the sky's blue
from sunlight reflecting off the ocean.

36:18.356 --> 36:20.400
I don't know nothing after that.

36:20.609 --> 36:22.486
Why do you think that guy's secretary
disappeared?

36:22.695 --> 36:25.782
Arturo? I don't know.
They said he got food poisoning.

36:25.949 --> 36:27.534
Did you get that guy hardware?

36:27.993 --> 36:29.203
No.

36:29.787 --> 36:30.871
Beltran wasn't a diplomat.

36:31.038 --> 36:33.249
He couldn't have
brought the weapon into the country.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.587
- You figure I got it for him?
- He's supposed to guard Mr. Beltran...

36:36.754 --> 36:38.422
- ... and he disappears?
- What did I do?

36:38.631 --> 36:41.968
Sneak the guy out on a blimp?
You think I set this man up?

36:42.135 --> 36:43.804
You think I set Mr. Beltran up?

36:43.971 --> 36:45.389
He was gonna be my meal ticket.

36:45.556 --> 36:48.560
- I was gonna get well off him.
- I was supposed to take care of them.

36:48.727 --> 36:50.938
You took care of the girl.
She's walking around.

36:51.104 --> 36:53.399
- He made his own bed.
- I don't know what to tell her.

36:53.608 --> 36:56.903
I got my nose against the glass like you.
You want to tell her something?

36:57.070 --> 37:00.408
Tell her they found industrial-strength
currency detergent in his laundry bag.

37:00.616 --> 37:03.077
Tell her they're tracking down
that lead.

37:03.244 --> 37:05.539
I don't want to
hear from you anymore, Mike.

37:10.086 --> 37:11.963
I'm sorry you feel that way.

37:16.510 --> 37:18.137
How you doing, James?

37:18.304 --> 37:21.016
I just finished my statement.

37:21.433 --> 37:23.602
I wish I knew what the hell
happened out there.

37:23.769 --> 37:25.939
Well, I've had five ask-abouts
from the DEA.

37:26.147 --> 37:28.734
I'll bet Beltran was shopping
some kind of deal with them.

37:28.901 --> 37:30.236
That lawyer was his go-between?

37:30.444 --> 37:33.907
Yeah, and someone else
didn't want the deal to go through.

37:34.157 --> 37:37.035
That's the last time
I work for Mike Roberts, lieutenant.

37:37.161 --> 37:39.831
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'm gonna talk to that girl.

37:47.006 --> 37:49.926
- Greg, can I talk to Miss Beltran?
- Yeah, yeah, we're done.

37:50.093 --> 37:53.806
Miss Beltran, just stop by my desk
afterward and sign your statement.

37:53.973 --> 37:56.476
- All right.
- I'm sorry about your father.

37:56.643 --> 37:58.770
Thank you.

38:04.527 --> 38:06.154
How you doing?

38:07.656 --> 38:10.702
I'll take you back
whenever you're ready.

38:10.868 --> 38:13.997
I keep seeing him lying there.

38:16.459 --> 38:18.044
Do they know why it happened?

38:18.378 --> 38:21.256
The guy's not saying. You know,
the one who shot your father.

38:21.423 --> 38:25.470
Do you think you're being nice to me,
not telling me what you know?

38:25.720 --> 38:28.765
I don't know anything more
than I'm telling you, Leticia.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.685
I could have understood...

38:32.103 --> 38:35.273
...if he'd told me what his life was like.

38:38.110 --> 38:41.322
Now I'll never understand anything.

38:45.327 --> 38:47.622
- I have to call my mother.
- Okay.

38:49.332 --> 38:52.169
Come on, I'll take you back, all right?

39:01.221 --> 39:04.851
You know that woman's boy
took a beating over that gun today?

39:05.977 --> 39:07.563
The woman who knew your wife?

39:07.729 --> 39:11.776
Yeah, turns out he was stashing it
for some older kids.

39:12.151 --> 39:15.280
- They beat him for giving it up.
- Is he all right?

39:15.989 --> 39:17.575
Yeah.

39:17.742 --> 39:19.077
The cop on the school post...

39:19.285 --> 39:21.830
...he gave me some names
and where these kids hang.

39:21.997 --> 39:23.499
You going to look for them?

39:24.208 --> 39:26.502
I'm gonna take a ride over there.

39:29.589 --> 39:34.178
- You want some company?
- No, that's all right. It's my thing.

39:34.387 --> 39:36.264
Who do you think you are,
The Lone Ranger?

39:36.431 --> 39:38.267
Come on, I'll ride along with you.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.079
I got it.

39:56.831 --> 39:58.583
Cop. Cop. Cop. Cop.

39:59.835 --> 40:03.464
- You'd be Bruce, John and Mace?
- Hey, yeah, Bruce, John and Mace.

40:03.589 --> 40:07.010
Or you know, I could be Mace,
he could be Bruce and he could be John.

40:07.177 --> 40:11.098
- However you like it, boy.
- I like it that you're punks 1, 2 and 3.

40:12.892 --> 40:14.936
Punk one. Back off!

40:15.395 --> 40:18.941
You beat on a kid the other day who
was holding a piece for one of you.

40:19.191 --> 40:21.486
- His name is Nick.
- I don't know any Nick.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.656
Commit this to memory, punk one.
He's 11 years old.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.410
From now on, you don't talk to him.
You don't go near him.

40:27.618 --> 40:29.454
If you or anybody else touches him...

40:29.663 --> 40:33.375
...I will bust your head against the curb
and kick your meager brains under a bus.

40:33.542 --> 40:34.961
Okay, but you gotta let me go.

40:35.628 --> 40:39.591
You make your friends understand this.
They look like they're slow learners.

40:41.344 --> 40:43.555
Hey, you a cop?

40:44.264 --> 40:45.974
I'm a detective. You'd be Bruce, right?

40:46.516 --> 40:49.270
You know, we could file a complaint
on you for violence on him.

40:49.896 --> 40:53.942
Detective Simone, that's with an E.
The shield number's 3118.

40:54.109 --> 40:56.320
You can get it off your forehead
in the mirror.

40:57.864 --> 41:00.784
- All right.
- You file all the complaints you want.

41:00.951 --> 41:02.870
- But you know what I'm saying here?
- Yeah.

41:03.037 --> 41:04.497
I want you to understand...

41:04.664 --> 41:07.000
...or else I'm gonna come back
and hunt you down.

41:07.167 --> 41:08.835
All right.

41:09.002 --> 41:11.088
Walk.

41:17.304 --> 41:19.056
Glad I was here to help.

41:19.223 --> 41:23.019
I would've been glad enough if they were
standing there with a Smith & Wesson.

41:23.186 --> 41:26.524
I don't know if I saved this kid from
a beating or bought him another one.

41:26.690 --> 41:29.235
I'm sure they saw the light.
They may be on their way...

41:29.402 --> 41:31.530
...to Scout registration now.

41:46.089 --> 41:48.759
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:51.012 --> 41:54.725
- Did you lose the key?
- No, I got it.

41:56.810 --> 41:59.230
You want something to eat?
I could heat something up.

41:59.397 --> 42:02.985
No, thanks, I grabbed a bite.

42:03.485 --> 42:05.154
What about you?

42:05.446 --> 42:07.073
I had a salad.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.326
Uh...

42:09.826 --> 42:15.083
I picked up my laundry
so I could have a fresh shirt tomorrow.

42:19.922 --> 42:23.301
I cleared out half the closet for you.

42:27.181 --> 42:30.518
I thought the official move
wasn't until next week.

42:32.020 --> 42:33.397
I'm getting ready for it.

42:35.399 --> 42:38.445
I also cleared out some drawers.

42:46.413 --> 42:48.457
And I got you this.

42:49.667 --> 42:52.086
It's terrycloth.

42:55.090 --> 42:57.384
Thanks, Sylvia.

42:58.135 --> 43:01.264
It's for when you come out
of your shower.

43:04.685 --> 43:08.606
- Yeah, I guess I'd better take one.
- You don't need to for me, Andy.

43:08.773 --> 43:10.984
No, I'll feel better.

43:11.109 --> 43:14.614
Well, okay.

43:31.426 --> 43:33.679
So how was work today?
- Uh...

43:33.845 --> 43:37.433
It was all right.
I mean, he was good on the case.

43:37.600 --> 43:42.147
- So it's going better than you thought?
- Yeah, he's okay for now.

44:00.503 --> 44:02.589
- What are you doing?
- I thought it'd be fun...

44:02.756 --> 44:05.926
...if we both took a shower.
Two for the price of one.

44:06.093 --> 44:11.558
- I usually shower alone.
- You want me to leave?

44:11.683 --> 44:13.936
No, I'm just saying is all.

44:16.606 --> 44:21.237
Here, I'll wash your back.

44:35.254 --> 44:41.094
Hey. Hey.
I usually wash myself down there.

44:41.720 --> 44:44.181
Do you want me to stop?

44:44.557 --> 44:48.979
Uh... Well, not necessarily.

44:53.109 --> 44:56.196
Boy, that's sure gonna be clean.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.242
Hmm.
