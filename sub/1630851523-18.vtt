WEBVTT

00:04.961 --> 00:06.571
It was spectacular.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.312
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

00:08.356 --> 00:10.314
Oh, Samantha just showed
us the musical Hamilton.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.924
Oh, how was it?

00:11.968 --> 00:13.665
It was a triumph.An inspiration.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.015
The pinnacle
of human achievement.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.191
It was fine.

00:21.586 --> 00:22.848
Hello.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
Hello. Uh, do you
have a moment?

00:24.720 --> 00:25.721
Uh, sure. Come in.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.375
Oh.Oh, hey,

00:27.418 --> 00:28.637
it's those neighbor people.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.334
The Farnsbys.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.119
We just wanted to come by
and drop off a tin

00:32.162 --> 00:34.817
of Margaret's
award-winning lemon bars.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.688
And offer you our sincerest

00:36.732 --> 00:38.864
congratulations
on the imminent opening

00:38.908 --> 00:40.344
of your bed and breakfast.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.130
Oh, that's
so nice of you.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.914
Slightly out
of character.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.611
So, you're really going
through with it, then?
Yep.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.483
As I told you when you
came over for dinner

00:48.526 --> 00:49.745
and tried to extort us...

00:49.788 --> 00:51.094
So sorry about that.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.835
...we're opening up the B and B,

00:52.878 --> 00:54.228
and that's just
all there is to it.

00:54.271 --> 00:57.013
Well, then, you have
left us no choice.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.972
We are sorry, but we would
like to purchase your house.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.235
Wait, what?

01:01.278 --> 01:02.801
We'll pay
a fair price.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.151
We just don't want to deal
with the headache

01:04.194 --> 01:06.240
of living next door
to a B and B.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.242
I mean, the traffic,
the noise.

01:08.285 --> 01:11.071
The middle class trudging past
in their Volvos.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.985
They are hard to root for.I'm sorry,

01:13.029 --> 01:15.466
but no. Our first guests
are arriving in a few days,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.077
so you're just gonna
have to get used to it.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.948
Well, then
this isn't over.

01:18.991 --> 01:22.386
You have incurred
the wrath of the Farnsbys.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.040
Enjoy those
lemon bars.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.306
Sam!

01:34.355 --> 01:36.313
Screw those rich people.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.576
We're not selling.
Who do they think they are?

01:38.620 --> 01:41.449
Yeah, with their fancy cars
and their pickleball courts.

01:41.492 --> 01:44.147
Babe, let-let's
not drag pickleball into this.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.280
I mean, I've actually gotten
pretty into it lately.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.282
What? Since when?
Hey, guys.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.022
Hey.
Oh, I played
a couple games with Mark.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.502
We're pickle bros.

01:51.546 --> 01:52.808
Again, that term
is not catching on, Jay,

01:52.851 --> 01:54.114
but, yeah,
this guy's good.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.593
What's not good
is the termites

01:55.637 --> 01:56.942
I just found
in your basement.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.206
Oh, hate the news,
love the segue.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.164
Yeah, that was some
pretty nice wordplay.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.557
Come on,
I'll show you guys.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.167
Ugh, it's just
one thing after another

02:04.211 --> 02:05.516
with this house,
right?

02:05.560 --> 02:07.344
Seriously, it's like
we're cursed.

02:08.867 --> 02:12.262
Oh, boy. This is not good.What's the big deal?

02:12.306 --> 02:13.785
They'll just
spray or tent.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.222
I mean, it's not gonna be
a pleasant few days,

02:15.265 --> 02:18.050
but we literally can't die,
so there's that.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.965
No, Jay is right,
they are cursed.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.532
I know because

02:21.576 --> 02:23.578
I cursed them myself.What are you talking about?

02:23.621 --> 02:24.796
When they first move in here,

02:24.840 --> 02:26.015
we tried
haunting them out,

02:26.058 --> 02:27.451
and haunting fail,
so to prevent

02:27.495 --> 02:29.453
the B and B from opening,

02:29.497 --> 02:31.412
I place Norse curse
on them.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.153
Sure, makes sense.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.155
Then bad things
start to happen.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.113
Sam falls down the stairs,

02:37.157 --> 02:40.160
and the curse makes me
light the gazebo on fire.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.423
Now, the opening
approaches,

02:42.466 --> 02:44.555
the curse only grows
stronger.

02:44.599 --> 02:47.210
Come on. Curses
aren't real, right?

02:47.254 --> 02:48.907
We're stuck in
an endless purgatory.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.735
We saw a guy go down on us
a couple weeks ago.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.737
And curses is where
you draw the line?

02:52.781 --> 02:54.957
Okay.Those are some valid arguments.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.567
Thor, you got to go
tell Sam about this.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.134
It's pointless.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.657
Curse cannot be erased.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.398
Plus, if we tell Sam,

03:01.442 --> 03:03.183
she might take TV away.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.926
You see that blistering
in the wood?

03:07.970 --> 03:09.014
Termites.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.233
Unfortunately.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.279
Yup. Termites love oak.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.019
Actually,
I think that's pine.

03:14.063 --> 03:17.240
Pine? Are you some kind
of idiot, Stuart?

03:17.284 --> 03:18.285
Look at the grain.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.460
Is this something that needs

03:19.503 --> 03:21.113
to be taken care of right away?

03:21.157 --> 03:23.551
It's just, our first guests
arrive in a couple days.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.205
You don't need to tent today,

03:25.248 --> 03:26.380
but I wouldn't put this off
for too much longer.

03:27.729 --> 03:31.167
Hey, how's my boy Pete
doing, huh?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.647
Hello.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.389
Oh, okay, I get it.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.695
You're too good to talk
to a cholera ghost.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.350
Well, la dee dah.

03:40.394 --> 03:43.092
So...

03:43.135 --> 03:45.703
have there been any updates
on the Nigel front?

03:45.747 --> 03:48.184
No, no.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.707
No, sadly.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.448
Ever since our
awkward conversation

03:51.492 --> 03:52.841
where he tried
to take things in a more

03:52.884 --> 03:54.669
romantic direction, and I...

03:54.712 --> 03:57.106
Responded by running away
through a wall, mm-hmm.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.108
Yes, ever since that,

03:59.151 --> 04:01.066
we haven't spoken.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.938
I think
he's avoiding me.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.592
I probably blew it.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.638
Don't think
like that, Isaac.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.075
You're letting fear lead you.
You need to go for

04:10.119 --> 04:12.426
what you want.
You only have one afterlife.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.994
Do not sacrifice
your shot.

04:17.431 --> 04:20.042
Please tell me you're not
quoting that musical Hamilton.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.261
Incorrectly,
I might add.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.914
I am, and
I am deeply sorry,

04:22.958 --> 04:24.916
but it was just
so inspirational.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.093
Oh, God. I wish Sam
never had shown us that.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.530
But you're right.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.097
I have. I have spent
the last two centuries

04:32.141 --> 04:34.317
letting fear rule me.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.014
It must come
to a stop.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.757
I'm gonna go tell Nigel
how I feel.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.370
This is a very important
moment, Isaac.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.677
I'm honored to be here
bearing witness to it.

04:46.721 --> 04:50.333
In the room where
things are happening.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.769
Oh, my God. Please.I'm sorry.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.250
No, just stop.I will. I'll try.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.034
So catchy.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.080
You're not gonna believe this,

04:58.123 --> 05:00.125
but Josh and Leeanne
just canceled.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.562
Our guests? Really?

05:01.605 --> 05:03.303
Oh, it gets
so much worse.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.392
They say they found
another B and B that is nearby,

05:05.435 --> 05:07.481
that is much nicer and cheaper

05:07.524 --> 05:09.221
and has a pickleball court.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.832
The Farnsbys.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.008
That's right. We turned down
their buyout offer,

05:13.051 --> 05:16.054
so they opened a rival B and B
to drive us out of business.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.969
They're sociopaths.

05:18.013 --> 05:21.582
They're calling it
The Farnsby & B.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.279
The Farnsby & B.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.541
That's a clever name.

05:24.585 --> 05:27.892
But also awful of them to do.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.938
But, geez, pretty darn clever.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.293
Welcome to The Farnsby & B.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.860
We are just
returning your tin.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.165
Thank you for
the lemon bars.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.471
Do you have time
for a quick word?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.343
We're a little busy.

05:43.386 --> 05:46.998
We are hosting the most lovely
couple from Erie, P.A.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.218
Josh and Leeanne.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.959
I believe you may have
heard of them.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.309
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.180
This is crazy.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.052
If your point is, it's annoying
to have a bustling business

05:57.095 --> 05:59.402
in your backyard,
then yes, we empathize.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.665
Although, if you like,
my offer still stands.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.188
We are not selling you
our place.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.321
Well, then, game on.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.105
And this is a game
you cannot win

06:07.149 --> 06:09.586
because we don't need
to make money.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.196
We can beat your prices

06:11.240 --> 06:12.676
and bleed you dry.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.243
Holy Toledo,
you can see me?

06:14.286 --> 06:15.679
And without an income,

06:15.723 --> 06:17.420
how long can you two
really hold out?

06:17.464 --> 06:19.640
Because we can do this
a long time.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.990
We are loving this Newhartlife.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.603
Oh, hello. Henry, Josh
needs the Wi-Fi password.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.605
Again? This is
the fourth time.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.826
I mean, no problem.
I live for helping my guests.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.393
Hey,
I think the batteries

06:33.436 --> 06:34.698
in the TV remote
are dead.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.309
Well, then go outside.
It's lovely.

06:37.353 --> 06:40.225
I mean, one minute,
dear customer.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.227
You two can see
yourselves out.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.013
Hey.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.580
Did the actor from
Bedtime for Bonzo

06:46.623 --> 06:48.190
really become president
in the '80s?

06:48.233 --> 06:49.974
I'm sorry, we have to go.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.759
Wait a minute,
who are you talking to?

06:51.802 --> 06:53.064
Do they have
ghosts, too?

06:53.108 --> 06:54.457
So creepy.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.938
What? I'm just referring
to the situation,

06:56.981 --> 06:58.548
not you
in particular,

06:58.592 --> 07:00.028
whoever you are.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.944
Uh, very sorry for
your loss of yourself.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.164
Knock, knock.
Anybody home?

07:06.208 --> 07:07.644
Oh, Jenkins.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.603
I'm sorry, I was
looking for Nigel.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.431
Oh, you haven't heard.

07:11.474 --> 07:12.910
Heard what?
I'm...

07:12.954 --> 07:14.999
sorry to have
to tell you this, as I know

07:15.043 --> 07:17.306
the two of you
have grown quite close,

07:17.349 --> 07:19.047
but Nigel...

07:19.090 --> 07:20.875
is no longer with us.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.790
You mean...

07:22.833 --> 07:24.618
He got sucked off.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.716
Hey, ghosts,
we're home.

07:35.759 --> 07:36.934
Hey, team.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.588
Oh, man.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.721
I wish they'd stop
walking over that.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.810
Yeah, that pine's
not looking good.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.465
Oh, again
with the pine?

07:45.508 --> 07:48.337
Are you trying
to piss me off, Stuart?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.121
Look, I'm not an expert--
No!

07:50.165 --> 07:51.645
The only thing
you're an expert at

07:51.688 --> 07:53.647
is giving people cholera!

07:53.690 --> 07:55.518
Welp, just got an email
from the Millers.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.259
They're canceling for next week.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.608
Oh, boy.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.001
You got to tell them
about it, Thor.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.177
Any guesses on where
they're booked now?

08:02.220 --> 08:03.787
I'm gonna go with Farnsby & B.

08:03.831 --> 08:06.529
It's like the B and B,
but with their name.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.357
I don't get it.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.706
Sam.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.013
I have something
to tell you.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.494
Long time ago,
when you first move in,

08:14.537 --> 08:16.321
uh, I may have

08:16.365 --> 08:18.019
put a curse on you and Jay.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.803
Excuse me?
Yeah.

08:19.847 --> 08:22.589
It was to prevent you from ever
opening up a bed and breakfast.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.330
Okay, small update.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.811
Thor apparently placed
a Norse curse on us

08:27.855 --> 08:29.509
to stop us
from opening the B and B.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.075
Are you serious?

08:31.119 --> 08:32.860
Okay, I'm gonna jump on
the skeptic side here.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.384
I don't think
Thor's curses work.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.128
Of course, anything's possible.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.527
Okay, so assuming
the curse is even real--

08:47.570 --> 08:50.007
Whoa, whoa, babe, a little
bit more definitive, please.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.227
Hey, Norse gods,
just to be clear,

08:52.270 --> 08:54.055
we believe you
have powers, so...

08:54.098 --> 08:55.883
love and respect.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.885
Yeah, you never want to poke
a curse-- just makes it angry.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.626
Fine. Thor?

08:59.669 --> 09:01.845
How do we even
break the curse?

09:01.889 --> 09:03.804
There is one way.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.502
But it involves boiling
ingredients in cauldron.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.983
And ingredients
impossible to come by.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.594
Requires sailing
to distant lands to procure.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.030
Thor's saying
we'd have to travel

09:13.074 --> 09:14.771
to distant lands
to get stuff.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.904
So what would we need to get?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.296
Hesitant to even say.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.776
That is how futile

09:19.820 --> 09:21.430
this knowledgewill be.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.217
One pound...

09:28.959 --> 09:30.352
...sugar.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.701
Oy gevalt.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.660
Oh, oh, sugar?
Like, regular sugar?

09:33.703 --> 09:35.575
Entire pound--
did you not hear?

09:35.618 --> 09:37.533
And that's not all.
Also need

09:37.577 --> 09:39.579
rare spice from faraway land.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.016
One pinch worth
more than 30 horses.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.149
Goes by name of...

09:45.193 --> 09:46.890
cinnamon.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.239
Oh, my God.Oh, child.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.198
Yeah, I think
we'll be all right.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.808
Okay, babe.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.594
Pound of sugar
and a cinnamon shaker.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.378
Why even open
bed and breakfast?

09:56.421 --> 09:58.598
Sell cinnamon,
and live like kings!

10:00.251 --> 10:01.775
So what's the procedure, Thor?

10:01.818 --> 10:04.125
You'll take sugar and cinnamon,
put in boiling water.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.954
I'll say incantation,
and then we wait.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.042
How long do we wait?

10:08.085 --> 10:10.522
50 years.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.876
No, just
a little curse-breaking humor.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.791
Curse break immediately.
It's good.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.185
So? How did everything go?

10:21.229 --> 10:23.753
Uh, it's fine. I don't really
want to talk about it right now.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.668
All right,
well, here we go.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.279
Uh, hold up-- is this gonna
reverse the bad things

10:28.323 --> 10:30.238
that happened
as a result of the curse?

10:30.281 --> 10:31.848
Or is just gonna stop

10:31.892 --> 10:34.024
more bad things from happening
in the future?

10:34.068 --> 10:35.896
Interesting
curse question.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.506
Again, never had
this much sugar,

10:37.549 --> 10:39.551
so it's... hard to say.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.205
Wait, why are you asking,
Alberta?

10:41.249 --> 10:43.686
Well... Thor said

10:43.730 --> 10:45.906
the curse made
Sam fall down the stairs.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.909
Which is the thing that
gave her the ability to see us.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.389
Y'all get
where I'm going with this?

10:51.433 --> 10:53.000
Oh, boy, you're not
pouring the sugar.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.741
Why are you not
pouring the sugar?

10:54.784 --> 10:56.612
The ghosts are saying
this could result

10:56.656 --> 10:58.440
in me not being able
to see them.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.007
What? For real?

11:00.050 --> 11:01.573
They say there's a chance.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.053
Very small
chance, like...

11:03.097 --> 11:05.360
size of Jay's forearm,
so should be fine.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.579
Yeah, it actually doesn't
make any logical sense that

11:07.623 --> 11:09.799
the effects would be reversed,
so I think you're good.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.630
You'll be fine.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.111
Okay, they-they think it's okay.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.243
Mm. By "okay,"
you mean you will continue

11:19.287 --> 11:21.115
to see dead people
wherever we go.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.378
Yes.Oh, thank God.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.728
Okay, let's do this.

11:25.772 --> 11:26.773
W-Wait.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.168
Um...

11:31.212 --> 11:32.996
I-I recently learned

11:33.040 --> 11:35.433
that you should say things
to people before it's too late.

11:35.477 --> 11:38.045
So even if this
isn't goodbye,

11:38.088 --> 11:40.961
I think I speak for us all
when I say, Sam,

11:41.004 --> 11:43.572
you have changed our afterlives

11:43.615 --> 11:45.400
for the better.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.358
And we are forever grateful.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.273
Yeah.Absolutely.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.406
Thank you, guys.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.886
And please finish my biography!

11:52.929 --> 11:54.670
You have really dropped
the ball on that.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.368
Okay. You may proceed.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.808
Wait! Just in case, I, too,

12:01.851 --> 12:04.767
just want to say, that it has
been a true honor knowing you.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.031
You arrived here a stranger
with harlot hair,

12:08.075 --> 12:10.381
but you have won
my heart.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.296
And become...

12:12.340 --> 12:15.256
like a daughter...
with harlot hair.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.694
I'd also like to say something.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.914
I did say I spoke for us
all, just a reminder.He did.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.480
Sam...

12:22.524 --> 12:24.221
you can be a part
of my troop any day.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.788
Also, please tell Jay

12:25.832 --> 12:27.268
I love him and that Mark sucks

12:27.311 --> 12:28.965
and he shouldn't be friends
with him anymore.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.793
Thorfinn want to thank you

12:30.837 --> 12:32.534
for giving me Viking funeral.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.666
Sorry for putting curse on you.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.060
You can't be mad
'cause I said sorry.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.627
Aah, Sam!

12:38.670 --> 12:41.021
If this is goodbye...

12:41.064 --> 12:43.458
Okay, so the floodgates
are just open.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.199
...I'm gonna miss you.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.157
And I forgive you
for not solving

12:47.201 --> 12:49.681
my murder,
although I guess you could still

12:49.725 --> 12:52.032
keep working on it. Oh,
and if you make any progress,

12:52.075 --> 12:53.947
just stand
in the middle of the room

12:53.990 --> 12:56.471
and just tell me. I'll be here.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.995
Thank you for everything, Sam.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.084
For helping me
tell my story.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.217
Oh, and also for making
all those pepperoni pizzas.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.566
Please keep doing that.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.396
Hey, Sam, thank you
for being a true friend.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.093
I'll be here,
watching your life.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.834
And when you die, God willing,
you'll become a ghost.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.793
And I don't even care
how old you get first.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
I know you'll keep it tight.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.448
There it is.
Mm.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.754
Sam, you're the best thing
that's happened to me

13:18.798 --> 13:19.799
since shrooms.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.584
Which did lead
to my death.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.891
But which then led to you.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.675
Thanks, shrooms.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.287
Thank you.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.463
Thank all of you.

13:32.507 --> 13:33.813
All done?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.379
Great, can we break
this thing?

13:35.423 --> 13:37.817
I can't do this.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.819
Yeah, I couldn't hear
anything they were saying,

13:39.862 --> 13:41.995
but your face says it all.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.735
If there is even a small chance
that this could make them

13:43.779 --> 13:45.868
all go away, then I-I don't want
to take that chance.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.958
So...
we're gonna live with a curse?

13:49.002 --> 13:50.786
The curse might not even
be real-- we don't know!

13:50.830 --> 13:52.222
I mean, Pete got shot
with an arrow.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.442
Is he cursed?
The truth is

13:54.485 --> 13:56.618
life is going to throw obstacles
in our way,

13:56.661 --> 13:59.273
but you know what?
We will take them as they come.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.275
I mean...

14:01.318 --> 14:02.842
we can treat the termites.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.713
We can replace
an old chandelier--
Okay.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.194
Yes, but what are we gonna do
about the Farnsby & B?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.239
We can't compete with them, Sam.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.894
Their place is way nicer,
they can charge next to nothing.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.896
They're beating us
at our own game.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.464
Then maybe we need

14:16.507 --> 14:19.641
to beat them at their own game.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.906
Pickleball, I'm...

14:23.950 --> 14:25.255
I'm talking about pickleball.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.996
It was so unclear, babe.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.438
Okay, here's the deal--
you're running the B and B

14:34.482 --> 14:35.744
to put us out of business,
but we know you hate it.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.311
What? We love it.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.834
It's so much fun.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.662
Oh, by the way,
we need to pick up

14:40.705 --> 14:42.446
some more hand soap
for Leeanne and Josh.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.187
What are they doing,
eating it?

14:45.797 --> 14:47.582
Okay, fine,
we don't love it.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.758
And frankly it's even
ruining Newhartfor me.

14:49.801 --> 14:52.500
I feel like I'm at work
now when I watch it.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.416
So why don't we settle this
B and B feud once and for all?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.984
One game of pickleball
for all the marbles.

14:58.027 --> 15:01.030
You win and we sell you
our place and leave town.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.293
What?!Ah-ah-ah, don't worry, remember?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.426
Jay's a ringer.We win,

15:05.469 --> 15:07.384
and you close down
Farnsby & B for good.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.778
You think you can beat us?

15:09.821 --> 15:11.780
At pickleball?
The reigning

15:11.823 --> 15:14.522
B-League mixed doubles
seniors champions?

15:14.565 --> 15:15.697
Is that good?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.133
I can't tell.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.439
Fine. You've got a deal.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.267
Our court is closed until May.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.964
So we'll play
at the country club.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.272
Wait, you belong to a
pickleball country club?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.361
Is it just pickleball
or is there golf?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.232
I have a lot of
follow-up questions.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.582
The only question that matters
will be answered on the court,

15:31.626 --> 15:34.324
this afternoon.
Come along, Margaret.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.674
Is there a dress code?

15:38.763 --> 15:40.417
Here we go.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.985
Looking forward to owning your
house at a fair-market price.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.508
Looking forward
to putting you out of business.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.729
They're back.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.383
Here they come.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.515
Well, how did it go?

15:51.559 --> 15:53.300
Well, it didn't start out great.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.779
Zero, zero, two!

15:57.782 --> 15:59.262
Aha!

15:59.306 --> 16:01.351
The rare pickle ace!

16:01.395 --> 16:03.397
This is way harder in real life.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.964
What?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.140
"Real life"?
What does that mean?

16:07.183 --> 16:09.098
It turns out Jay hasn't actually
been playing pickleball.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.795
He's been playing
a pickleball video game.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.406
It's basically
the same thing.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.885
It's a simulator.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.757
It's the same reason
I can land a 747.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.411
Jay, we
bet the house!

16:17.454 --> 16:19.500
Would you bet the house
on landing a 747?

16:19.543 --> 16:21.328
I mean, if it came to that,
there'd be a lot more

16:21.371 --> 16:22.807
on the line
than a house.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.984
So what happened?
Did y'all win?!

16:25.027 --> 16:26.202
Well, it was
neck and neck.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.899
Back and forth.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.814
And then...

16:29.858 --> 16:31.642
11, ten, two.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.384
Ow! Ow!

16:34.428 --> 16:35.995
Henry!
Margaret!

16:36.038 --> 16:37.953
My back, my back!
Oh, get the IcyHot.Oh, no.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.085
Get the IcyHot!Oh!

16:39.128 --> 16:40.260
So forfeit due to injury?

16:40.303 --> 16:41.609
Yeah, baby!

16:41.652 --> 16:43.089
We won by default!

16:43.132 --> 16:45.178
But a W is a W.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.615
But they are shutting down
their B and B?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.660
Yeah, Josh and Leeanne are
on their way over here

16:49.704 --> 16:51.053
to check in right now.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.321
Any chance we could call
this place Farnsby & B?

16:58.365 --> 17:00.062
I hate to see
that name go to waste.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.108
Oh, like B and B!

17:02.151 --> 17:04.240
That's so clever.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.156
Ah, there you are!

17:07.200 --> 17:08.897
Nigel!

17:08.940 --> 17:11.030
But how are you here?

17:11.073 --> 17:12.901
This doesn't make
any sense.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.642
You got sucked off.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.078
You wish I got sucked off.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.341
So you and your bearded floozy

17:18.385 --> 17:21.431
could continue galivanting
without my knowledge!

17:21.475 --> 17:23.346
What are you talking about?

17:23.390 --> 17:26.001
Not sure what's happening,
but I am here for the drama.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.786
Oh, I'm right there
with you, Sass.
Mm.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.919
I'm talking about you
and your lover.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.226
The Viking?

17:35.141 --> 17:38.100
I mean, I think you're
a great guy, Isaac...

17:38.144 --> 17:39.754
What?

17:39.797 --> 17:41.669
You think I'm with that brute?

17:41.712 --> 17:43.801
Hurtful.But Jenkins said--

17:43.845 --> 17:47.022
Jenkins told me
that you got sucked off!

17:47.066 --> 17:48.719
What do you think,
tacos for dinner?

17:48.763 --> 17:51.896
Oh, dear, I think
I know what this is.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.898
Well, tell me, Nigel,
because I am

17:53.942 --> 17:55.987
thoroughly confused--
what is going on?

17:56.031 --> 17:58.425
150 years ago,

17:58.468 --> 18:00.601
Jenkins and I had
a brief tryst.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.994
And apparently
he's never gotten over it.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.822
So he was lying
to both of us,

18:04.866 --> 18:06.520
to keep us apart.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.568
Oh... why would he care

18:11.612 --> 18:13.396
about keeping two buddies apart?

18:14.615 --> 18:16.182
Oh.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.488
Um...

18:18.532 --> 18:20.577
sure, Isaac.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.188
Well, I guess I'll just go,

18:22.231 --> 18:24.320
since that's cleared up.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.021
Nigel, wait.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.552
I like you.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.555
You...

18:41.598 --> 18:43.339
like me?
Mm-hmm.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.385
Yeah, please don't
make me say it again.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.562
Well...

18:48.605 --> 18:50.520
I like you too, Isaac.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.134
This is so sweet.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.918
I knew.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.180
I already knew.
It has been very hard

18:58.224 --> 19:00.443
keeping this secret,
but he already told me.

19:00.487 --> 19:01.879
And I'm sure
you all are as shocked

19:01.923 --> 19:04.360
as I was when I first heard.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.193
Color me flabbergasted.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.934
What's going on?!

19:14.457 --> 19:15.893
Oh, my God.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.069
That must be them.
It's our first guests!

19:18.113 --> 19:20.071
Babe, we made it!

19:20.115 --> 19:22.378
Yes, suck on that, curse!

19:22.422 --> 19:24.511
Whoa! Hey, are you nuts?

19:24.554 --> 19:26.600
Hey, Norse gods,
that was just a joke.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.993
You know Sam... she's, like,
the Loki of the house.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.473
Again,
it's probably not even real.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.214
And even if it is, it's okay.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.260
The curse was to prevent us
from opening the B and B.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.479
Now we're open. We won.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.568
I guess, yeah.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.967
You ready?

19:46.010 --> 19:48.665
Let's do this.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.583
Welcome to Woodstone B and B.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.848
Babe...?

20:00.242 --> 20:02.070
Oh! Oh, my God!

20:02.113 --> 20:03.985
It's all good--
it's just an old house!

20:04.028 --> 20:06.030
It's not a curse.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.380
Enjoy your stay!

20:07.423 --> 20:09.208
Oh, hey, Pete.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.774
Oh. Hey, Nancy.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.864
Stop flirting,
it's not happening, geez.
