00:04.272 --> 00:07.575
[music playing]

00:11.579 --> 00:13.447
I'm so sick of this.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.250
Your dad is not leaving that
greasy engine out on the lawn

00:16.284 --> 00:17.651
for one more day.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.687
It's starting to attract
stupid guys in t-shirts.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.791
I wouldn't bother
him right now, mom.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.093
He's real upset
because grandma called

00:25.126 --> 00:26.494
and she needs money from us.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.496
Well, we are not
giving that crazy woman

00:28.529 --> 00:30.331
any more of our money.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.433
Last time we did that she
spent it all on Dionne

00:32.466 --> 00:33.901
Warwick and her psychic friend.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.640
DJ, your shoes are
caked with mud.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.209
Get them off my couch.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.042
OK.

00:45.746 --> 00:50.384
You know, DJ, this rebellious
phase you're going through,

00:50.418 --> 00:51.952
is over.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.588
Go take off those muddy shoes.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.291
Roseanne, we've got
to talk about my mother.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.162
OK, you want to talk.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.797
We'll talk.

01:03.831 --> 01:06.567
I got something to tell you
and I don't want any grief,

01:06.600 --> 01:07.868
understand?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.503
My dad missed an
alimony payment.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.704
I've got to give
my mom some money.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.640
I'm not talking 10
or 20 bucks here.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.575
It's more like $400.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.944
Well, god, Dan.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.380
I mean it is your mother,
do you think I'd object?

01:19.413 --> 01:23.451
What kind of a person
do you think I am?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.519
I'm sorry.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.088
Just so upset with my dad.

01:28.122 --> 01:31.859
Why the hell can't he
ever just be a man?

01:31.892 --> 01:36.897
Well, gee mom, you
sure handled him.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.867
Well, Becky, you really have
to look at the big picture.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.071
Now your father is in a bad
mood and he just wants a target

01:44.104 --> 01:46.707
and I'm not going to be that.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.377
Instead he'll yell at somebody
else, blow off some steam,

01:49.410 --> 01:52.012
and then I'll go at him.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.981
OK, mom, I took off my shoes.

01:57.751 --> 02:01.422
You are just so clever, DJ.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.491
You outwit me at every turn.

02:03.524 --> 02:07.295
I just don't even
know what to say.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.263
Thanks.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.700
Could you do your old,
stupid mother a favor?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.101
Would you go ask
your dad to move

02:14.134 --> 02:15.403
his engine off the front lawn?

02:18.506 --> 02:19.473
OK.

02:19.507 --> 02:23.911
[music playing]

03:18.899 --> 03:20.268
You're late.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.602
Well, we'd have
been here sooner

03:21.635 --> 03:24.204
if she hadn't spent so much
time putting on the make up.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.507
Well, it's a little
hard to apply eye liner

03:26.540 --> 03:27.975
when something's
suckling on your boob.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.348
I know, that's why I make
Dan dress in the other room.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.589
Baby, I'll be right back.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.892
I'm just going to top him off.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.861
We really appreciate you
watching him for us, Roseanne.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.062
Lately it's been
kind of hard for us

03:49.096 --> 03:50.431
to get any time together.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.799
Yeah, well who
would have thought

03:51.832 --> 03:55.002
that a screaming,
leaking bundle of smells

03:55.035 --> 03:57.805
would kill the romance?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.507
I don't think it's the baby.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.710
I think it's just that Jackie's
a little hard to get close to.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.712
I mean, I know she hasn't a
lot of experience with men.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.546
Heh.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.084
What?

04:11.118 --> 04:14.788
So, Fred, you're
worried that Jackie hasn't

04:14.822 --> 04:16.790
had enough experience with men.

04:16.824 --> 04:21.194
[chuckle]

04:21.228 --> 04:22.330
Yeah.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.298
JACKIE: Roseanne, can
you come here a minute?

04:24.332 --> 04:26.734
Well, trust me, Fred, you've
got nothing to worry about.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.936
Jackie knows her
way around a man.

04:28.969 --> 04:32.105
We could blindfold her and she
could take one apart and put

04:32.139 --> 04:35.876
him right back together again.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.512
Fred, you and Jackie
dropping the baby off here

04:38.546 --> 04:41.549
and going out on a
date, things getting

04:41.582 --> 04:42.516
serious between you two?

04:47.555 --> 04:49.490
Has she really been
out with a lot of guys?

04:49.523 --> 04:53.026
Oh Fred, when doing
a background check

04:53.060 --> 04:56.397
on a girlfriend, it's rarely
wise to ask the brother-in-law,

04:56.430 --> 05:00.401
especially when his wife
is the ham fisted Roseanne.

05:00.434 --> 05:05.038
But let me just say this
about Jackie's past, hooha.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.777
The head.
The head.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.111
The head.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.980
Oh please, Jackie, haven't
you noticed that I've gotten

05:13.013 --> 05:15.115
a lot better at this by now?

05:15.148 --> 05:18.752
I mean, DJ's neck is a lot
less bent than Becky's.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.253
Bye, sweetie.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.154
Bye bye.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.557
OK, we ought to go.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.860
Yeah, you better go because
we've got a couple of buyers

05:26.894 --> 05:30.163
coming over to look at him.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.566
See you later.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.134
I got to get to ma's.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.203
Well, don't you want to play
with the baby for a few minutes

05:36.236 --> 05:37.405
first?

05:37.438 --> 05:38.372
We're not going to play
the last one that touches

05:38.406 --> 05:39.206
him, changes him, are we?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.378
No, the last time
we did that, you

05:44.412 --> 05:46.279
didn't touch DJ for two years.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.661
Oh, this is nice.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.563
God, dad, when
I look at him, I

06:02.596 --> 06:04.398
think that anything's possible.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.701
You know, he could
be president someday.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.270
Remember when we used to
have hopes for our own kids?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.377
Kind of relaxed there, huh?

06:17.411 --> 06:18.278
Yeah.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.080
That's good.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.915
I don't want you to give
your mother any money.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.756
Roseanne, we've
been over this.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.625
Well, Dan, she's just going
to do something loopy with it.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.595
I mean, how many
Boxcar Willie albums

06:34.628 --> 06:38.466
does someone with
no stereo need?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.067
She needs the money.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.570
Well, I didn't know that
we don't need it, Dan.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.837
I must not have
been home the day

06:43.871 --> 06:46.440
that we got everything
we need out of life.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.808
She was crying again.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.042
Well, of course
she was crying Dan.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.410
She cries all the time.

06:50.444 --> 06:54.281
She cries when people
lose on Star Search.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.983
This is different.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.619
No, Dan, that $400
is supposed to put

06:58.652 --> 07:01.321
DJ through medical school.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.223
Can't you get your
dad to pay it?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.093
My dad doesn't care about
my mom, so it's up to me.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.529
Well you know, if he doesn't,
of course we'll help her out.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.164
I've always believed in
sticking by your family,

07:11.198 --> 07:14.234
but you know, just
as a last resort.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
Fine, we'll do it.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.704
Take the baby back, he's wet.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.971
No, you touched him last.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.351
This is the nicest place
anyone's ever taken me.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.720
Well, you deserve it.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.588
Anyone who gives birth to a
child of mine gets a free meal.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.826
I'm glad I had
your child, then,

07:38.859 --> 07:41.094
because some of the
guys I've dated,

07:41.128 --> 07:43.330
be lucky to get a bowl
of pretzels and a beer

07:43.363 --> 07:45.899
at the Lobo.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.536
So you had a lot of
dates at the old Lobo?

07:48.569 --> 07:52.472
Oh boy, did I?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.241
Oh look, they've got
dancing on Fridays.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.676
Hey, that's nice.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.545
A lot of guys wouldn't
like to go dancing.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.582
Have a lot of guys
taken you dancing?

08:01.615 --> 08:02.950
Uh, yeah.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.519
Same guys that took you to
the Lobo or a whole fresh batch?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.724
Trying to ask me something?

08:10.758 --> 08:11.859
No, no, not really.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.928
Well, Fred, come on,
you can ask me anything.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.798
I mean, you've seen me
in the most embarrassing

08:17.831 --> 08:19.933
position imaginable.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.702
And you were there
when the baby was born.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.975
Well, OK.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.911
How many men did you
date before we met?

08:30.944 --> 08:33.781
Well, you mean dated at
all or dated seriously?

08:33.814 --> 08:35.115
I mean seriously.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.652
OK, I'd have to
say just a few.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.289
Good, it's not that I mind if
you slept with a lot of guys--

08:42.322 --> 08:43.156
Well, slept with--

08:49.362 --> 08:51.531
that's not what you asked me.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.266
No, I guess it wasn't.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.703
Oh Fred, don't worry.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.104
It's not that many.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.575
I would say three a year.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.910
Since you were what?

09:02.943 --> 09:03.744
18?

09:06.413 --> 09:07.214
OK, we'll go with that.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.753
Wow.

09:12.786 --> 09:16.657
Well, Fred, that's
not that many.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.492
Three a year for 20 years is 60.

09:24.164 --> 09:28.636
God, I don't even
know 60 people.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.171
Well, I didn't
know all of them.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.912
You men have such
a double standard.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.982
You know, I'm sure you
slept with a ton of women.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.784
Three.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.618
Three?

09:47.855 --> 09:48.656
Three, huh?

09:51.659 --> 09:53.761
Just the three?

09:53.794 --> 09:56.864
Yep, just the three.

09:56.897 --> 10:01.368
Well, does it bother
you that I've been active?

10:01.401 --> 10:03.837
Oh look, let's just
talk about something else.

10:03.871 --> 10:04.805
No, I've got a better idea.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.940
Let's not talk at all.

10:06.974 --> 10:07.775
Hi.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.183
No, I haven't had him.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.322
So why are you so
surprised, Jackie?

10:22.355 --> 10:25.025
You think a guy wants to
know that the woman he's with

10:25.058 --> 10:28.395
has slept with 20 times
more people than he has?

10:31.665 --> 10:34.001
You should have lied.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.268
I would never lie.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.403
Why not?

10:36.436 --> 10:38.205
I lied to Dan about how
many guys I was with.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.106
Really?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.974
Well yeah.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.010
He said he was with
like seven women.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.147
So I figured that meant five.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.617
And I was with six guys,
so I said three, you know,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.452
to make sure to come
in under his five.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.157
And you think that was good.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.292
I think that was brilliant.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.661
Well, what's the big deal?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.997
Why can't the man just
accept that maybe the woman's

11:04.031 --> 11:05.999
had more experience than him?

11:06.033 --> 11:10.403
Because then he knows that she
knows that he's not very good.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.905
Well, Fred's good.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.507
He's perfectly good,
you know, especially

11:14.541 --> 11:16.443
considering his just the three.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.580
Perfectly good, huh?

11:20.613 --> 11:22.082
Where have you been, Jackie?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.384
Every man has to
think he's the best.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.453
Well, I'm not
going to lie to him.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.788
And I think in the
long run, Fred would

11:27.821 --> 11:29.456
want me to tell him the truth.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.624
No, men want to
hear that they're

11:31.658 --> 11:34.161
strong and handsome and smart.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.329
They do not like
to hear the truth.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.231
Do you agree with that, David?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.566
Absolutely not.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.169
If Darlene ever lied to me,
I think I'd be really hurt.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.804
Well that isn't true, David.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.472
Remember how upset
you got when she told

11:45.505 --> 11:46.974
you that you had poodle hair?

11:55.648 --> 11:56.917
She never said that to me.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.053
Oh.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.294
Well, maybe she was
sparing your feelings

12:07.327 --> 12:09.329
but I guess you feel
a lot better now

12:09.362 --> 12:10.563
that you know the truth, huh?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.501
Yeah.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.402
I do.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.738
I feel a lot better.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.908
What do you guys
think of my hair?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.142
Oh, we think it's great.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.043
It looks just great.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.111
I think it's stunning.

12:24.144 --> 12:28.515
Roseanne, he asked
to know the truth.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.018
And David, the truth is that
your hair is a little odd.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.861
Thank you for being
so honest, Jackie.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.495
By the way, you know how
everyone's telling you

12:42.529 --> 12:44.597
you're as thin as you were
before you were pregnant?

12:49.469 --> 12:50.237
You're not.

[music playing]

13:05.185 --> 13:08.989
Man, that's good syrup.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.257
You want a jug?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.158
I got plenty.

13:11.191 --> 13:11.992
No thanks, dad.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.472
Look, I talked to mom today.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.773
Yeah?

13:26.806 --> 13:27.607
How is she?

13:32.445 --> 13:33.246
She's fine.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.853
She says you owe her some money.

13:39.887 --> 13:44.624
Yeah, well I talked
to her, Danny, and--

13:44.657 --> 13:46.826
and I'm going to
take care of it.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.261
Is that boy of yours
still playing hockey--

13:48.295 --> 13:50.063
Come on, dad.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.764
I said I'd take care of it.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.000
Look, I'm going
over there tonight.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.535
I'm going to give her the
$400 that you owe her.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.669
Are you going to
give me the money

13:56.703 --> 13:58.138
or is it going to
come out of my pocket?

13:58.171 --> 14:02.876
Danny, I've already talked the
situation over with your mom.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.512
What situation?

14:05.545 --> 14:09.449
Well, it hasn't been
a really great yeah, OK?

14:09.482 --> 14:12.319
I mean, I've had a flat patch.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.387
Office doesn't want
to send me out so--

14:14.421 --> 14:16.189
so much anymore.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.257
I got a new family here.

14:17.290 --> 14:21.094
Tough, you've got
old responsibilities.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.762
Danny, are you going
to make a speech?

14:22.795 --> 14:25.798
Because if you are, I think
we ought to get more chairs.

14:25.832 --> 14:26.866
We'll call the neighbors in.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.268
I'm not going
to make a speech.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.904
What I'm going to do is try to
remind you of your obligations.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.072
I shouldn't have to do that.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.306
You're a grown man.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.574
Can you just calm down?

14:34.607 --> 14:36.276
And she was
crying on the phone.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.244
Danny, that's her way.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.479
Not like this.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.581
She was crying so hard I
couldn't understand her.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.384
OK, sometimes your mother,
she gets very emotional

14:44.417 --> 14:47.454
and everything kind of gets
out of perspective, you know?

14:47.487 --> 14:50.991
I mean, Danny, women have a
tendency to do that, you know?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.459
Women have a
tendency to get upset

14:52.492 --> 14:54.962
when you treat them like crap.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.630
You know your mother.

14:57.664 --> 14:58.999
This is not about money, Danny.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.400
You know?

15:00.433 --> 15:04.204
Sometimes you're talking to her
and she's just not all there.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.274
Hey, hey, there's
nothing wrong with mom.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
I didn't say there was
anything wrong with her.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.710
Who said there was
something wrong with her?

15:10.743 --> 15:13.880
You know that
she's had it hard.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.117
I know that.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.553
This kind of stuff
is not good for her.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.791
Danny, if I could
help her I would.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.665
Yeah, Roseanne said you
might be willing to clean up

15:32.699 --> 15:33.533
your own mess.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.135
But I told her she was wrong.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.269
Come on, Danny.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.971
Don't leave-- don't leave mad.

15:38.005 --> 15:38.905
Come on.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.939
I'm not mad.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.441
One thing about you, dad.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.675
You will never let me down.

[music playing]

15:55.388 --> 15:56.256
Hey, Jackie.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.090
Hello.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.893
Still mad, huh?

16:00.927 --> 16:01.861
Oh, I'm not mad, Jim.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.998
Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.867
So many of you, I get confused.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.902
Listen, Jackie, we
need to discuss this.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.071
What's to discuss?

16:11.104 --> 16:16.409
I slept with 60 men,
most of them separately.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.410
I can vouch for that.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.880
I was there that
night selling tickets.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.282
Will you quit
giving me a hard time?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.850
I'm just trying to accept this.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.387
Fred, of all the men
that I have slept with

16:27.420 --> 16:31.658
and all the things
that I done in my past,

16:31.691 --> 16:34.094
have made me the
person that I am today,

16:34.127 --> 16:36.463
the person that you're
supposedly in love with.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.864
I know that, but
all I'm trying--

16:37.897 --> 16:39.299
But nothing, we're
supposed to be adults.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.400
Right?

16:40.433 --> 16:41.934
And you know what really
ticks me off, Fred?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.304
Is that I was honest and you
didn't even appreciate it.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.672
And instead you're punishing me.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.341
Oh, look, for
God's sakes, Jackie.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.376
I'm not punishing you.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.943
I'm just trying to
be honest about how

16:50.977 --> 16:52.412
I feel about all this.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.748
Well, I think you're
both a couple of idiots.

16:55.782 --> 16:59.352
Sorry, I thought we
were being honest.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.354
Baby, what's the matter?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.855
What do you mean,
what's the matter?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.257
Can't you imagine
how scary this is

17:04.291 --> 17:08.628
to him where the big fuzzy thing
is yelling at the milk machine?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.469
You know, I'm through
discussing it, Fred.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.037
The next words I want to
hear out of your mouth

17:18.071 --> 17:19.172
are an apology.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.274
Well, I'm not going
to apologize for the way

17:21.308 --> 17:22.342
that I feel.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.577
Then I don't have
anything to say to you.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.478
Jackie.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.913
Just stay out of it, Roseanne.

I don't need your kind of help.

solid relationship here

17:42.095 --> 17:43.463
Am I nuts, Roseanne?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.098
Wouldn't this bother Dan?

17:45.132 --> 17:49.836
Not at all, Dan knows how
many men Jackie's slept with.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.772
Come on, Roseanne,
if Dan found out

17:52.805 --> 17:55.842
that you'd slept with a
lot of guys, he'd be upset.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.345
No Fred, I really don't
think he would, you know,

17:58.378 --> 18:01.181
because we have known
each other a lot longer.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.751
And Dan knows that he doesn't
have anything to worry about.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.619
Hey, I'm not worried.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.222
This isn't about
me being insecure.

Oh, of course not because you
have no reason to be insecure.

I know.

And she had your kid.

And she also told me that you're
the best lover she's ever had.

18:34.881 --> 18:35.682
No.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.554
Yeah, and that's
like the best of 60.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.293
That is a lot of guys.

make any difference to you,

18:49.796 --> 18:50.597
Yeah, right.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.373

give us a second?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.008
Yeah, sure.

You're building an honest,
solid relationship.

Jackie, I'm sorry.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.250
I was wrong.

So, you're OK with this?

19:12.452 --> 19:13.320
Oh, of course I am.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.854
I was never that upset about it.

19:14.887 --> 19:15.855
You weren't?

19:15.888 --> 19:19.226
No, how insecure
do you think I am?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.294
The most important thing
is we were open and honest

19:21.328 --> 19:22.429
with each other.

Fred, oh, you're the best.

have to say it.

What did your mom do when
you gave her the money?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.297
Did she do like
she did last time

19:57.330 --> 20:00.833
and wash each and every bill?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.034
I didn't give her the money.

I had to take her
to the hospital.

I don't know.

accident or something?

20:14.046 --> 20:17.183
Well, it's not that
kind of hospital.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.353
What are you talking about?

20:20.387 --> 20:23.523
When I got there, she was
sitting outside in the rain.

I don't even think
she knew who I was.
