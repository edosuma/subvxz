WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.736
Grab a seat with The Cool Kids.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.472
Oh, that's not gonna
be a problem.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.906
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.641
And check out
our other programs--

00:07.675 --> 00:09.177
Last Man Standing and Rel.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.744
Only on Fox.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.217
(clearing throat)

00:16.250 --> 00:18.519
(whooping)

00:18.552 --> 00:19.920
You look great, honey.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.922
Margaret,
why are you so dressed up?

00:21.955 --> 00:24.525
You look like you're going
to Catwoman's funeral.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.727
(chuckles) I don't know what
you guys are talking about.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.929
I mean, all I did
was put on a little extra...

00:28.962 --> 00:31.365
No, no, no, no, no.
More than a little.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.667
You look... dazzling.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.936
Oh, well, you guys
are really sweet, but I...

00:35.969 --> 00:38.038
I mean, damn, have you
been sick the whole time

00:38.072 --> 00:40.774
that we've known you, and you
just got over it this morning?

00:40.808 --> 00:42.876
All right!

00:42.910 --> 00:45.879
The takeaway is I look great.
That's because

00:45.913 --> 00:48.182
I have a third date
with a guy that I like a lot,

00:48.216 --> 00:50.984
and I think tonight
might be the night. (chuckles)

00:52.320 --> 00:54.188
The sex night.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.224
-Oh...
-Ooh...
-Who's this

00:56.257 --> 00:58.592
soon-to-be-lucky mystery man?

00:58.626 --> 01:00.728
Karl, from the third floor.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.930
Oh, yeah, Karl?
Good man.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.799
We talk football.
He knows his 49ers.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.701
Very clever, too.
Always doing puzzles.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.737
Word jumbles, crosswords,

01:09.770 --> 01:12.240
sudoku... Well,
y'all know what puzzles are.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.608
And talk about a backstory.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.445
The guy was the Zodiac Killer.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.314
What?

01:21.982 --> 01:24.118
Wait, what the hell

01:24.152 --> 01:26.320
are you guys talking about?

01:26.354 --> 01:27.788
See...
(clears throat)

01:27.821 --> 01:29.757
the Zodiac was a serial killer

01:29.790 --> 01:31.959
who terrorized San Francisco
in the '70s.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.827
To this day, never been caught.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.763
I know who the Zodiac Killer is.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.998
Why are you saying
that it's Karl?

01:38.031 --> 01:41.602
'Cause Karl
is the Zodiac Killer.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.904
-Sometimes you don't listen.
-Ah...

01:43.937 --> 01:46.140
Okay, I get what this is.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.909
You're trying to look out for me
by trashing the guy

01:48.942 --> 01:50.644
that I'm dating--
it's very cute.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.113
My older brother used to do
the same thing.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.482
Honey, we're not trashing him.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.083
He was a serial murderer,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.919
and we still like him.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.021
He hasn't killed anyone
since the '70s.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.492
No harm, no foul, right?
Date away.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.594
The Zodiac Killer does not

02:06.627 --> 02:09.430
live at Shady Meadows, okay?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.132
Karl is very sweet,
and tonight we're gonna go out

02:12.166 --> 02:13.834
and we're gonna do stuff.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.438
Sex stuff!

02:17.471 --> 02:19.207
Ooh!

02:19.240 --> 02:21.642
I'll bet Margaret
and the Zodiac Killer

02:21.675 --> 02:25.045
will make a really sweet couple.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.916
*

02:48.902 --> 02:53.307
Fellas, I just got back
from the west wing bathroom,

02:53.341 --> 02:57.144
and there is no easy way
to say this.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.714
Someone didn't flush.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.016
We're just talking
about pee, right?

03:03.050 --> 03:05.519
Hank, look in my eyes.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.121
You think I'm just talking pee?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.362
Was it stall one,
the sacred stall?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.863
Where else would I go?

03:15.896 --> 03:18.031
It's the best stall
in all of Shady Meadows.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.767
The seat is always
the perfect temperature,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.369
not too hot, not too cold.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.604
It's like sitting on Goldilocks.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.706
I'm only asking
because it happened

03:25.739 --> 03:27.341
-to me as well.
-What?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.910
Wait a minute.
You're saying this is a trend?

03:29.943 --> 03:32.246
Well, why didn't you
bring this up before?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.115
Because it seemed like
a weird thing to talk about.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.285
To be honest, it still does.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.788
Allison?

03:40.821 --> 03:43.591
We got something very important
to talk to you about.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.958
Uh, can it wait?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.294
I...

03:46.327 --> 03:49.397
would rather not talk
to you guys.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.032
Well, likewise, honey,
but this is urgent.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.202
Someone left a doodie
in the west wing.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.704
Okay, that is a problem.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.872
I'll send someone
to clean it up. Where?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.808
The toilet.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.843
Look at that. Problem solved.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.213
What has happened to decency

04:06.246 --> 04:08.716
and decorum
in this great nation?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.452
-It's like nobody cares.
-Yeah.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.454
Going to the grocery store
in your pajamas.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.289
-Put some damn clothes on!
-Yes.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.091
Getting four and five samples
over at the Froyo place,

04:18.125 --> 04:21.429
knowing good and well you know
what strawberries taste like!

04:21.462 --> 04:25.799
And now you're gonna walk away
from the greatest responsibility

04:25.833 --> 04:29.069
you have as a citizen:
flushing the toilet?!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.505
I let the pajamas go.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.007
-Yeah.
-I let the Froyo go.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.110
But I will not, by God,

04:37.144 --> 04:39.780
let this go.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.083
-(grunts)
-(chuckles)

04:43.116 --> 04:44.985
Amen, brother.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.421
We have got to find this monster

04:47.455 --> 04:49.289
before he strikes again.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.359
Gentlemen, this may be

04:51.392 --> 04:53.527
the most important thing
we ever do!

04:53.561 --> 04:54.695
Yeah.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.035
(Margaret chuckles softly)

05:02.069 --> 05:04.538
I am having
such a great time, Karl.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.540
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

05:06.574 --> 05:08.308
you smell amazing.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.310
-Really? What can I say?
-Mm.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.546
-Today's laundry day.
-Mm.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.616
You don't want to dance
with me on Thursday.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.352
Thanks for the tip.
I won't.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.521
That's a joke.
I always wear clean clothes.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.056
Mmm. I know, Karl.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.993
I'd be honored to dance with you
any day of the week.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.861
Oh, well, back at you.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.663
Who knew you were
such a great dancer?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.499
Well, that's the best thing
about dating someone new,

05:31.532 --> 05:33.367
isn't it?
Discovering things about them.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.669
Like how you told me
you have Lee Majors' face

05:35.703 --> 05:38.138
tattooed on your thigh.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.040
No regrets.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.043
(both chuckle)

05:43.076 --> 05:45.479
Oh, I don't want
this night to end.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.681
Well, it doesn't have to.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.718
We can go back to my place
and keep dancing.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.020
Karl...
(clears throat)

05:53.053 --> 05:57.591
how would you like
to meet Lee Majors tonight?

05:58.626 --> 06:00.928
Gonna need a check over here.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.699
-That damn waiter's
still ignoring us.
-I know. He's been terrible.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.768
I could go psycho on that guy.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.737
(imitates music from Psycho)

06:09.770 --> 06:12.072
Or like this...
(chuckles)

06:12.105 --> 06:14.107
(laughing)

06:15.609 --> 06:16.877
(chuckles)

06:16.910 --> 06:18.378
Shh.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.414
Shh, shh, shh.

06:27.488 --> 06:31.324
So, how about we go back
to your place for that dance?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.465
Now, if we're gonna find
this person,

06:37.498 --> 06:39.399
we need to start
with a list of suspects.

06:39.433 --> 06:43.136
That way we can, um...
flush out the non-flusher.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.972
You see what I did there?

06:45.005 --> 06:47.975
Ah, I saw it and I loved it.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.445
Oh, yep, the suspect list
was always, uh, "step one"

06:51.479 --> 06:53.447
back when I was on the force.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.416
-You were a cop?
-Security guard at Woolworth's.

06:56.450 --> 07:00.488
They let me go when I stole a
bunch of stuff from Woolworth's.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.923
Well, thanks for ruining
my date, guys.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.992
I was having
a great night with Karl,

07:05.025 --> 07:07.895
and then all I could think about
was the Zodiac Killer.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.997
Well, that makes sense,
'cause you were on a date

07:10.030 --> 07:11.632
with the Zodiac Killer, so...

07:11.665 --> 07:14.735
Y'all. Y'all!

07:14.768 --> 07:16.303
Y'all.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.240
Our stall got hit again,
didn't it?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.643
It got hit hard.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.678
I weep for America.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.446
This is not
why George Washington

07:26.480 --> 07:28.248
chopped down that cherry tree.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.518
What the hell are you guys
talking about?

07:30.551 --> 07:34.488
Someone has not been flushing
in the west wing stall.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.525
Lord, I need to hang out
with more women.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.993
Can somebody just
please explain to me

07:40.027 --> 07:41.829
this whole Zodiac theory?

07:41.862 --> 07:44.698
All right, your boyfriend Karl
lived in the Bay area

07:44.732 --> 07:47.968
during the '60s and '70s,
where the Zodiac worked.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.437
Karl is obsessed with lakes,
where a bunch

07:50.470 --> 07:52.205
of the Zodiac's crimes occurred.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.808
Karl also loves puzzles.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.277
Just like the Zodiac.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.548
Puzzles! Lakes! 1970s! Karl!

08:00.581 --> 08:03.684
We don't have time for this!

08:03.717 --> 08:06.019
So your stupid situation
is more important than the fact

08:06.053 --> 08:08.488
that you think I might be dating
a serial killer?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.490
Ex-serial killer.
He retired.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.025
Just like we all did.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.995
-This is a retirement community.
-Yeah.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.165
I used to be a meter reader.
I don't think you're worried

08:18.198 --> 08:21.068
about me trying
to read meters again, are you?

08:21.101 --> 08:24.738
So this is all
the evidence you have, huh?

08:24.772 --> 08:27.140
Karl is not the Zodiac Killer.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.743
He's a great guy.
He is harmless.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.913
And I am done entertaining
this ridiculous theory.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.718
(singsongy):
Annoying.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.932
Great job, Karl.
See you later.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.775
Hey, girlfriends!
(laughs)

09:01.809 --> 09:04.011
What?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.913
Us?

09:05.946 --> 09:09.182
Yeah. I just want to ask my gals
a couple of questions

09:09.216 --> 09:12.185
about one of the guys
that's in your art class, Karl.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.921
Like, does he have
a personal file

09:13.954 --> 09:16.056
I could maybe make
a quick copy of?

09:16.089 --> 09:18.425
Well, Margaret,
that's confidential.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.794
It would be unethical.
I would lose my job...

09:20.828 --> 09:24.064
He was born in Oakland,
spent some time in the Navy.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.633
And such an expressive artist.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.068
I actually have one
of his paintings right here.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.437
Punam, I really don't think we
should be sharing anything th...

09:30.470 --> 09:33.206
Oh, my God!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.142
That's a little intense.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.111
A little intense?
There's a dead body in it.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.813
All right, well,

09:39.847 --> 09:42.950
a painting
doesn't prove anything.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.418
I'm just gonna turn that over.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.156
I'm gonna level with you girls.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.158
Karl and I are dating.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.492
-Aw...
-Oh...

09:52.525 --> 09:54.662
And, uh, I get
all of my love advice

09:54.695 --> 09:56.296
from three male idiots

09:56.329 --> 09:59.232
who are currently
obsessed with a toilet.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.302
-So I need some help.
-Okay,

10:02.335 --> 10:05.739
you're looking for a little
Sex and the City action.

10:05.773 --> 10:09.109
Lucky for you I'm a Carrie
with a Miranda rising.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.511
I'm an Aiden.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.981
So... okay, here's what I do.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.784
Since my divorce,
I sabotage every relationship

10:16.817 --> 10:19.186
before it even
gets off the ground.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.989
And I... I don't want
to do that with Karl.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.925
But I-I can't get a read on him.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.827
Well, I have this test I use

10:26.860 --> 10:28.996
to separate
the good guys from the bad.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.031
I "spill" a glass of wine
on them.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.300
If he flips out,
I break up with him.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.169
But if he's cool about it,
I let him stick around...

10:36.203 --> 10:39.006
until he breaks up with me.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.374
Would you mind repeating
all of that?

10:41.408 --> 10:43.010
I'm sorry, I got distracted

10:43.043 --> 10:45.478
by how awful your life sounds.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.252
All right, we got to start
narrowing down our suspect list.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.059
Well, well, well.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.194
What have we here?

11:01.228 --> 11:04.898
Dudley seems to have sprouted
a tail.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.701
A TP tail.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.669
I'm going in.
I'll be the good cop,

11:09.703 --> 11:12.672
like I was at Sears after I got
fired at Woolworth's.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.810
So once Charlie softens him up,

11:16.844 --> 11:19.079
then I'll go in as the, uh,
bad cop.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.682
Then I'll swoop in as the
exasperated police chief

11:22.716 --> 11:24.852
who's sick of your antics,

11:24.885 --> 11:26.854
but if he's honest with himself,

11:26.887 --> 11:29.522
it's because you remind him
of himself

11:29.556 --> 11:32.659
when he was a young detective.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.262
There's more, isn't there?

11:35.295 --> 11:36.730
Yeah, yeah.
His name is Dutch,

11:36.764 --> 11:40.400
and his wife
is banging a contractor.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.038
Charlie, your fingertips
are magic wands.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.340
You're casting a spell on me.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.109
All right, Dudley,
your little spa day is over.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.845
That's right, bad cop is here.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.081
You don't seem
so bad to me, friend.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.416
I'm minutes away
from retirement,

11:56.449 --> 11:58.852
and you two knuckleheads
are playing games?

11:58.886 --> 12:02.455
My name is Dutch.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.958
We know what you've been doing
in the west wing bathroom.

12:04.992 --> 12:08.195
All right, all right, I confess.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.131
I drink from the bathroom sink.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.400
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.568
The-the... That's it?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.737
I mean, that's a little weird,
but that's it?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.072
Man, get out of here, Dudley.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.240
You got it.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.642
Good hang, you guys.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.816
Oh, my God, it has been so long

12:28.849 --> 12:31.418
since somebody cooked for me.
(chuckles)

12:31.451 --> 12:34.154
When I was married,
either I handled it myself

12:34.187 --> 12:36.623
or it didn't happen.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.625
Same went for our sex life.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.728
(laughs)
Well, I love to cook.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.563
(chuckles)

12:43.596 --> 12:44.832
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.167
Allow me.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.638
Nothing like a perfectly
sharpened blade

12:51.671 --> 12:53.673
slicing through flesh.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.246
(chuckles)

12:59.279 --> 13:01.248
Mmm. Mmm.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.250
That is so good.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.685
(both chuckle)

13:05.718 --> 13:07.587
You know,

13:07.620 --> 13:10.824
you don't have to cut
every single piece for me.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.526
Oh, would you like to cut
our steaks?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.930
I think we could each cut
our own.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.999
You have the best ideas.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.968
You're like a breath
of fresh air.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.203
(chuckles)

13:25.172 --> 13:26.840
You know, it's funny.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.508
When you first start dating,
everybody's trying

13:28.541 --> 13:30.310
-to be the best version
of themselves.
-Mm-hmm.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.845
I think it's time we pull
the curtain back

13:31.879 --> 13:33.280
and dig a little deeper.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.782
Mm-hmm.
Open up the old chest cavity

13:35.815 --> 13:39.519
and rummage around
in the guts, huh? (laughs)

13:43.423 --> 13:44.958
Sure.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.660
So, uh, let's put the cards
on the table.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.196
I will go first.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.365
In the past, I have
sabotaged relationships

13:52.399 --> 13:55.468
just as they were getting good,
over stupid stuff...

13:55.502 --> 13:58.338
The past is the past, babe.
My past is tricky, too, okay?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.473
I've hurt people.
Badly.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.475
I think that's where my night
terrors come from.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.312
(chuckles)

14:05.345 --> 14:07.881
W-Well, let's talk about that--
uh, hurting people.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.582
Are we talking
calling them names, or...

14:09.616 --> 14:11.484
(chuckles)
I don't know,

14:11.518 --> 14:13.987
k-killing large numbers of them?
(chuckling)

14:14.021 --> 14:17.224
Let's not play games, Margaret.
I like you, you like me.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.060
I haven't felt this way about
somebody in a long, long time.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.763
I feel the same way, too, Karl.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.999
Perfecto.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.734
Here's a thought.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.703
What about we go on a nice
romantic getaway this weekend?

14:30.737 --> 14:32.039
Oh, I love it.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.275
Perfecto, indeed.
(chuckles)

14:35.308 --> 14:37.677
I got a beautiful little house
in the country.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.747
You just keep getting better
and better, don't you?

14:40.780 --> 14:42.382
Mm-hmm. It's on the lake.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.954
It is so secluded, you could
scream your lungs out,

14:46.987 --> 14:49.289
nobody would even hear you.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.026
Is that so?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.094
I've tested it.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.129
Not even the echo of a scream.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.377
Oopsie.
(chuckles)

15:10.410 --> 15:13.246
Had a little spill there.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.151
You're gonna love
the lake house.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.689
Be sure and pack
a bathing suit.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.004
I thought I'd find you in here.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.172
Where's the rest
of the Mod Squad?

15:39.206 --> 15:41.908
On stakeout, undercover.
You'll never find them.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.643
MARGARET:
Well, they're right here.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.346
Those are Sid's feet,

15:46.379 --> 15:50.017
and Hank is crowning over
the top of the stall.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.085
SID: (high-pitched voice):
What? There's nobody

15:52.119 --> 15:54.087
by those names in here.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.023
HANK: Sid, we're in
the men's bathroom--

15:56.056 --> 15:58.258
why you talking like a woman?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.193
SID: (high-pitched voice):
Who's Sid, Hank?

16:00.227 --> 16:01.494
(clicks tongue)

16:04.964 --> 16:06.466
Scram, Margaret.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.335
We're trying to catch a perp
in the act.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.370
This is the time of day
when he strikes.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.638
Oh. Well, good.
At least you haven't

16:11.671 --> 16:13.473
taken this thing too far.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.542
Now, Karl has invited me
to go away with him

16:15.575 --> 16:17.610
for the weekend,
and I'm kind of worried.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.179
If I can prove
that he's not the Zodiac,

16:19.212 --> 16:20.713
then I can go up
to the lake house

16:20.747 --> 16:22.382
and get Maggy with it.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.651
Get Maggy with it?

16:24.684 --> 16:26.719
Well, look,
my son gave me one of those

16:26.753 --> 16:29.489
DNA ancestry kits last year
for Christmas.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.358
Turns out we're black.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.326
Anyway... (clears throat)

16:33.360 --> 16:36.496
if you can get some of Karl's
saliva, we could send it in,

16:36.529 --> 16:38.665
see if it matches
the Zodiac's DNA.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.368
Well, thanks, Hank. That's
actually a really smart idea.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.536
Which is a weird thing to say

16:43.570 --> 16:45.538
to a guy who has spent
the last three hours sitting

16:45.572 --> 16:47.574
on a toilet tank.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.443
Margaret, we took turns.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.382
We do a five-hour stakeout

16:55.415 --> 16:57.016
and this is the day
he doesn't show up?

16:57.050 --> 16:58.485
I'm not thinking too clearly.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.221
I need to splash
some cold water on my face.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.890
You know, we might want to
coordinate with the dining hall.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.325
He'll strike tomorrow for sure,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.061
because the menu is kale-heavy.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.863
-(Hank screams)
-What is it, Hank?

17:10.897 --> 17:13.600
I know why our non-flusher
didn't show up today.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.668
He was doing his business here.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.170
In my apartment?

17:17.204 --> 17:20.207
No! No!

17:20.240 --> 17:23.343
He knows we're watching him
and he's taunting us.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.279
What do you want?!

17:28.248 --> 17:31.851
Take a look at my tinkle-time
puzzle book.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.921
The word searches,
the-the jumbles,

17:34.954 --> 17:36.523
the sudoku...

17:36.556 --> 17:38.558
he solved them all.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.560
Wait a minute.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.895
The puzzles, the taunting--

17:42.929 --> 17:45.132
it's been under our noses
this whole time.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.735
The non-flusher has got to be...

17:48.768 --> 17:50.470
-Karl.
-Sid.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.741
Right. Karl makes a lot
more sense.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.323
-(thud)
-Oh.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.301
(screams)

18:27.440 --> 18:30.042
Right.
Night terrors.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.851
(screams)

18:41.888 --> 18:44.391
Not loving that.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.439
(sneezes softly)
Oh.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.108
What was that awful noise?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.043
Margaret?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.713
Hi, sleepyhead.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.523
What's going on here, Margaret?

19:16.556 --> 19:19.626
Well, really funny story.
My friends

19:19.659 --> 19:21.828
have been playing
this practical joke on me,

19:21.861 --> 19:23.963
and they accused you of being...

19:23.996 --> 19:25.698
We know it was you, Karl.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.467
What are you guys doing here?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.168
Saving this great nation!

19:31.538 --> 19:34.173
Ruining the west wing bathroom
was one thing,

19:34.207 --> 19:37.076
but my bathroom?
It's too much.

19:37.109 --> 19:40.413
That's where
I go to the bathroom.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.216
How many Froyo samples
is enough for you, Karl?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.151
Eight, nine?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.754
Is it ten?!

19:47.787 --> 19:51.524
All right, you guys,
give it a rest. Karl,

19:51.558 --> 19:54.661
I just need you to answer me
one simple question.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.764
Are you the Zodiac Killer?

19:59.131 --> 20:01.067
He was the Zodiac Killer.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.035
He is the West Wing Bandit.

20:03.069 --> 20:06.573
Admit it,
you sick son of a bitch.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.575
Yes. It was me.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.678
Of course it was me.
You figured it out.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.680
I got a thrill out of
doing my thing and watching

20:13.713 --> 20:15.582
everyone spin out.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.850
W-Which question
are you saying yes to?

20:17.884 --> 20:20.253
Margaret, you and me-- I just
don't think it's gonna work out.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.555
You seem a little psycho.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.524
Oh, no. You're not
breaking up with her.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.293
She's breaking up with you.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.429
We don't let our friends
date bathroom bandits

20:29.462 --> 20:32.932
that wipe their booties
with the U.S. Constitution.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.470
And FYI, I would have finished
my puzzle book,

20:37.504 --> 20:39.572
-I just needed more time.
-Wha...

20:39.606 --> 20:41.641
You deserve better
than this, Margaret.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.811
You need someone who knows
how to treat a beautiful toilet.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.779
W-Wait. But-but, Karl. Wait.
I just need to know.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.281
Please, tell me.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.149
Karl!

20:50.182 --> 20:53.286
Karl!
Are you the Zodiac?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.722
Blink for the first time
since I've known you

20:55.755 --> 20:57.590
if you're the Zodiac.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.827

the Hurdy Gurdy Man *

21:25.618 --> 21:28.955

to check out from Fox.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.974
Welcome to the galaxy.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.143
