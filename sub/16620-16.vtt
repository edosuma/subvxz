00:21.797 --> 00:23.562
Wow, Bobby, nice whistling.

00:23.587 --> 00:24.720
You're in a good mood.

00:24.745 --> 00:26.311
Yeah. Because tomorrow's Easter,

00:26.328 --> 00:27.560
which means all next week,

00:27.596 --> 00:29.040
everybody who gave up red meat for Lent

00:29.064 --> 00:30.697
will be coming in for a burger.

00:30.732 --> 00:32.365
We call it the Beef Boom.

00:32.401 --> 00:33.667
Beef Boom.

00:33.702 --> 00:36.325
And the kids are home for spring
break so they get to help.

00:36.350 --> 00:38.805
- Making that Lent rent!
- It's the dream.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.185
This year, I gave up
my cholesterol medication for Lent.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.509
Teddy, y-you shouldn't do that.

00:42.544 --> 00:43.743
It's okay, Doctor.

00:43.779 --> 00:45.356
Just a few more days,
I think I can make it.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.514
How many eggs am I allowed to eat? Nine?

00:47.549 --> 00:48.815
- None...
- teen?

00:48.850 --> 00:49.894
Gene, you're only robbing yourself

00:49.918 --> 00:51.418
of the fun of finding it later.

00:51.453 --> 00:53.820
But what if I accidentally
just peeled this one

00:53.855 --> 00:56.222
and it's on course to
intersect with this hot sauce

00:56.258 --> 00:57.924
and then somehow careen into my mouth?

00:59.094 --> 01:00.326
Oh, no!

01:00.362 --> 01:02.328
- Gene!
- Eat one from the other bowl

01:02.364 --> 01:04.397
so there's an even
number for the egg hunt.

01:04.433 --> 01:05.565
You got it, toots.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.833
Oh, right. You and Bob

01:06.868 --> 01:08.601
have your big egg hiding competition.

01:08.637 --> 01:10.236
Yep. Last egg found wins.

01:10.272 --> 01:12.105
This year we're doing 72 eggs.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.441
I mean 70, 'cause you're
eating another egg, right?

01:14.476 --> 01:16.009
Don't make me do math!

01:16.044 --> 01:17.422
It's a lot of work, but it's worth it

01:17.446 --> 01:18.878
because we do it for the kids.

01:18.914 --> 01:20.580
They love it! Plus, I always win.

01:20.615 --> 01:22.115
Ha, except for the last three years.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.383
You got lucky.

01:23.418 --> 01:25.185
This year, you're going down, mister!

01:25.220 --> 01:27.065
Hey, uh, what if we 
just took all these eggs

01:27.089 --> 01:28.922
right now and put them in the Dumpster

01:28.957 --> 01:30.790
so we don't have to
do the stupid egg hunt?

01:30.826 --> 01:32.225
Come on, Louise, you know how much

01:32.260 --> 01:34.027
they love it. It's their time to shine.

01:34.062 --> 01:37.731
Last year we didn't find the
last egg until 8:30 at night.

01:37.766 --> 01:39.610
And they don't give us our candy
baskets from the Easter Bunny

01:39.634 --> 01:40.767
till it's over.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.702
It's the perfect crime.

01:42.738 --> 01:45.638
I'm just saying, why don't
we just tell them we hate it?

01:45.674 --> 01:47.752
It would break their hearts. I
don't think we should do that.

01:47.776 --> 01:50.744
Ugh, okay, fine, but
feelings aren't Easter eggs,

01:50.779 --> 01:53.079
- and I can't hide them forever.
- Good one.

01:53.115 --> 01:55.548
Oh! I just thought
of a new hiding place.

01:55.584 --> 01:58.051
Mm-hmm. Is it inside
the paper towel roll?

01:58.086 --> 01:59.552
No.

01:59.588 --> 02:00.754
I hate you.

02:00.789 --> 02:04.090
Go to sleep, guys, or the 
Easter Bunny won't come.

02:04.126 --> 02:06.404
And don't come out of your
rooms, even if you have to pee.

02:06.428 --> 02:07.727
Just pee in your beds.

02:07.763 --> 02:09.162
Way ahead of you.

02:09.205 --> 02:11.839
Look what I found on sale at Food World!

02:11.867 --> 02:13.433
Jellybean schnapps.

02:13.468 --> 02:14.634
Isn't it fun?

02:14.669 --> 02:16.503
Theme drink.

02:16.538 --> 02:17.570
Oh, God.

02:17.606 --> 02:18.606
Oh, good.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.906
This is amazing.

02:19.941 --> 02:21.808
It's like all the flavors at once.

02:21.843 --> 02:24.811
Right? It doesn't even taste
like it has alcohol in it.

02:24.846 --> 02:25.979
How much does it have?

02:26.014 --> 02:27.280
100 proof?

02:27.315 --> 02:29.182
- Is that even legal?
- I think.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.751
I-I mean the label's got
a lot of misspelled words.

02:31.787 --> 02:33.253
And it looks like it's just taped on.

02:33.288 --> 02:35.021
Did you buy it at a store?

02:35.056 --> 02:36.823
Or did you just get it from a guy?

02:36.858 --> 02:38.458
I got it in the parking lot.

02:38.493 --> 02:41.028
I don't think Food World
sells in the parking lot.

02:41.053 --> 02:42.462
Everything is in the store,

02:42.497 --> 02:44.430
'cause that's where
you have to check out.

02:44.466 --> 02:45.932
You know, I thought that.

02:45.967 --> 02:48.101
Mm-hmm. It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

02:48.136 --> 02:49.412
Smell it! It smells good.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.971
Well, actually, it smells bad.
But it tastes good.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.439
Exactly. Happy Easter.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.274
Okay, same rules as always,

02:55.310 --> 02:56.809
and mark your eggs down on the map

02:56.844 --> 02:58.511
so we can make sure they all get found.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.613
And whoever's egg is
found last is the winner.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.415
- Let's have a clean fight.
- All right.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.116
One more drink for motivation.

03:04.152 --> 03:06.352
Okay, one more and then
it's time to get serious.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.120
Then we'll schnapps drinking.

03:08.156 --> 03:09.322
You get it?

03:09.357 --> 03:11.590
Stop? Schnapps. Stop.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.359
- Drink. Okay.
- No. Bob, you're babbling.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.628
Huh. Yeah. Am I drunk alrea...

03:19.668 --> 03:21.144
Oh, my God.

03:21.169 --> 03:22.635
Oh. Ow.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.804
Ow. I can feel my blinks.

03:24.839 --> 03:25.972
They hurt so much.

03:26.007 --> 03:28.140
Oh, I'm gonna barf.

03:28.176 --> 03:29.475
I'm gonna barf. I'm gonna barf.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.100
Wait. No, not yet. Oh, I'm too tired.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.357
Lin, what happened last night?

03:33.381 --> 03:34.480
Did we hide the eggs?

03:34.515 --> 03:37.183
Oh, I don't know. I think so.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.051
Oh, no, there's one in my hand.

03:39.087 --> 03:41.320
Um, I'll just hide it here.

03:41.356 --> 03:42.955
Under my pillow. Did you see?

03:42.991 --> 03:44.323
Yeah, no. I can't... oh...

03:44.359 --> 03:46.170
Hopefully I did a better
job with the rest of them.

03:46.194 --> 03:48.160
Okay, I'm gonna go barf now.

03:48.196 --> 03:49.895
Here I go. Getting up.

03:49.931 --> 03:51.831
No, oh, no, I'm sitting
down. I'm sitting down.

03:51.866 --> 03:53.733
I got to sit down. Oh, hi, kids!

03:53.768 --> 03:54.912
Hey, are we doing this or what?

03:54.936 --> 03:56.046
I need to get some jellybeans

03:56.070 --> 03:57.503
in my face before midnight.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.071
Please don't say "jellybeans."

03:59.107 --> 04:00.740
- Jellybeans.
- Gene.

04:00.775 --> 04:02.208
What's wrong with you guys?

04:02.243 --> 04:03.709
We were just up late.

04:03.745 --> 04:06.345
You smell like candy
and B.O. mixed together,

04:06.381 --> 04:08.180
like a... homeless M&M.

04:08.216 --> 04:09.915
Don't take this the wrong way,

04:09.951 --> 04:11.595
but you both look like
Nicholas Cage right now.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.419
Why don't you guys go
wait in the living room?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.501
I'm just gonna sit and,

04:15.526 --> 04:17.423
um, groan for a second.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.892
Hear ye, hear ye.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.427
Shh. Too loud, too loud.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.230
Ye olde annual Belcher egg hunt...

04:24.265 --> 04:25.498
What? I can't hear you!

04:25.533 --> 04:26.699
Shh! I can't hear you now!

04:26.734 --> 04:29.035
Okay, okay, Louise.

04:29.070 --> 04:32.204
Ye olde annual Belcher
egg hunt is about to begin.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.507
Remember to call out whose
egg it is when you find one,

04:34.542 --> 04:36.409
because one of those
eggs will be the last.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.943
And it will probably be mine.

04:37.979 --> 04:39.912
And... a-go.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.215
Get ready to lose, big talker.

04:43.251 --> 04:44.884
You're the one that's gonna lose, Bob.

04:44.919 --> 04:46.185
I hid my eggs great.

04:46.305 --> 04:48.120
Actually, I don't know if I did.

04:48.156 --> 04:50.623
Hey, do you remember
where any of your eggs are?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.458
Not really. Where's the map?

04:52.493 --> 04:54.427
Uh, oh, right, right,
right, map, the map.

04:54.472 --> 04:56.639
Ooh, map is a no-go.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.597
Did I write "Linda is a fart" on it?

04:58.633 --> 05:00.299
Yeah. You did.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.601
- That's hilarious.
- Eh. It's okay.

05:02.637 --> 05:04.570
Uh, don't worry, I'm sure
they'll find the eggs.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.633
I-I'm just gonna go
take some more aspirin.

05:06.658 --> 05:08.607
How many can I take? Like, 20?

05:08.643 --> 05:10.142
Yeah, that sounds right.

05:10.178 --> 05:11.288
Oh, you know what? I'll take ten.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.412
It's Mom's.

05:13.448 --> 05:15.247
In the plunger. Sorry, Mom.

05:15.283 --> 05:17.083
No, it's fun, it's fun.

05:17.118 --> 05:18.317
Easter's fun.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.086
- Come here, Gene.
- Yeah?

05:20.121 --> 05:22.315
Don't find another egg
unless it's got a "D" on it.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.340
Ha, ha.

05:24.459 --> 05:26.325
Found one. It's Dad's.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.561
Um, Tina, what if you just put it back?

05:28.596 --> 05:29.829
Dad, that's cheating.

05:29.864 --> 05:32.331
- I'll give you $500.
- I heard that!

05:34.441 --> 05:35.835
- It's Mom's.
- Huh.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.003
I feel like that was a hiding
place of mine last year.

05:38.039 --> 05:40.272
That's weird. It's almost
like you remembered it

05:40.308 --> 05:42.408
and then copied it
because it was so good.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.243
Don't you need to go start the ham?

05:44.278 --> 05:47.680
Ugh. You look like a
giant pink jellybean.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.849
Just glaze me and get it over with.

05:49.884 --> 05:52.073
- Sorry, Mom.
- Damn it!

05:52.120 --> 05:53.786
We have 62 eggs.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.188
And it's only 6:45 p.m.

05:56.224 --> 05:57.523
Yeah. In the early evening.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.625
Yeah. And we started at 7:00 a.m.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.460
I remember that. It was so long ago.

06:01.496 --> 06:02.661
I was young.

06:02.697 --> 06:04.908
- My feet hurt.
- Um, may I suggest that we

06:04.933 --> 06:06.198
could have some hints?

06:06.234 --> 06:08.467
No! Hints make it less fun.

06:08.503 --> 06:10.035
Trust us, they don't.

06:10.071 --> 06:11.704
Aw, they're loving it.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.938
I am getting hungry, though.

06:12.974 --> 06:14.039
Is the ham ready?

06:14.075 --> 06:15.283
Oh, let me check.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.476
I never turned the oven on.

06:17.512 --> 06:19.545
I-I think I might have
still been drunk earlier.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.679
And now.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.148
Should we order pizza?

06:22.183 --> 06:23.883
Did you guys find the last egg yet?

06:23.918 --> 06:25.017
No!

06:27.922 --> 06:29.889
Louise, you're getting flour everywhere.

06:32.326 --> 06:33.859
This is it! I did it!

06:33.895 --> 06:35.161
Number 70.

06:35.196 --> 06:36.462
- Whose is it?
- Is it mine?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.297
It is a "D."

06:38.332 --> 06:39.565
- No!
- Yes!

06:39.600 --> 06:40.633
I am the king!

06:40.668 --> 06:42.635
The king of eggs!

06:42.670 --> 06:44.181
All right, here are your candy baskets.

06:44.205 --> 06:45.371
Yeah!

06:45.406 --> 06:47.473
Great hunt, everybody.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.986
After you have a little candy, make sure

06:49.010 --> 06:51.143
you get a good night's
sleep for a Beef Boom.

06:51.179 --> 06:52.978
Time to strap on the old feed basket.

06:53.014 --> 06:54.980
I'm not even tasting it, mm.

06:55.016 --> 06:58.559
Remind me again, is it okay
to eat the Easter basket grass?

07:01.090 --> 07:03.055
Ugh, what's that smell?

07:04.292 --> 07:05.758
Smells like a Gene special.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.660
I'm flattered, but it wasn't me.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.495
Let's round up the usual suspects:

07:09.530 --> 07:12.198
Tina's breath, Tina's
pits, Tina's shoes.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.432
All good ideas.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.668
No, I, I know that smell.

07:15.703 --> 07:16.769
Me, too.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.270
Oh, my God! It's an egg!

07:18.306 --> 07:19.371
A rotten egg!

07:19.407 --> 07:21.073
Aah! Oh, no.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.575
Did we not find one of the eggs?

07:22.610 --> 07:25.109
Last one to find the
rotten egg is a rotten egg.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.561
That smell can't be an egg.

07:28.586 --> 07:30.224
You kids dyed 72 in the restaurant,

07:30.249 --> 07:31.467
and then Gene ate two.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.388
We hid 70, we found 70.

07:33.424 --> 07:35.324
Wrong, father, I ate one.

07:35.359 --> 07:37.292
What? I told you to eat another one

07:37.328 --> 07:38.927
so that we'd have an even number.

07:38.963 --> 07:40.662
You said, "You got it, toots."

07:40.698 --> 07:43.165
Uh, yeah, I meant it like,
"You've got it, toots,"

07:43.200 --> 07:44.933
like you've got that certain something.

07:44.969 --> 07:47.302
So there's still one
egg we haven't found.

07:47.338 --> 07:48.403
And it could be mine.

07:48.439 --> 07:49.638
The competition isn't over!

07:49.673 --> 07:50.772
I could still win!

07:50.808 --> 07:52.107
Isn't that fun, everybody?

07:52.142 --> 07:53.809
It's not not fun.

07:53.844 --> 07:55.277
Also, chances are, it's mine.

07:55.312 --> 07:56.812
- But it's probably mine.
- Mine.

07:56.839 --> 07:58.639
Ugh! This smell is worse than when Gene

07:58.682 --> 08:01.450
kept a turkey sandwich as
a secret pet for a year.

08:01.485 --> 08:03.919
Steve Turkel. He was my best friend.

08:03.954 --> 08:06.121
Is it getting worse? It is, right?

08:06.156 --> 08:08.256
Uh, w-we need to find
it, like right now.

08:08.292 --> 08:10.125
We can't. We got to open for Beef Boom.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.293
Oh, yeah, you're right.

08:11.328 --> 08:12.472
We'll just have to look for it

08:12.496 --> 08:13.695
at the end of the day.

08:13.731 --> 08:15.130
Great, because we love

08:15.165 --> 08:16.665
looking for eggs. Right, guys?

08:16.700 --> 08:18.133
We love, love, love it. Hmm. Uh...

08:18.168 --> 08:19.801
Missing egg, huh?

08:19.837 --> 08:21.314
You know, same thing
happened to a family

08:21.338 --> 08:22.471
on my street growing up.

08:22.506 --> 08:24.272
- They had to move out.
- Mm-hmm.

08:24.308 --> 08:26.341
Yeah. City had to
burn the building down.

08:26.377 --> 08:28.176
Uh, that can't be true.

08:28.212 --> 08:29.511
Thanks for the masks, Teddy.

08:29.546 --> 08:30.824
These will make it easier to search.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.014
No problem.

08:32.049 --> 08:33.159
Now we'll just be breathing in

08:33.183 --> 08:34.883
this skanky perfume while we look.

08:34.918 --> 08:37.385
"Sensational Gardens" is not skanky.

08:37.421 --> 08:40.188
It's a distinctive
fragrance by Kelly Ripa.

08:40.224 --> 08:43.325
Who is very classy and from New Jersey.

08:43.615 --> 08:45.494
We checked everywhere, and it's late.

08:45.529 --> 08:47.496
So maybe we should just go to bed.

08:47.531 --> 08:49.898
Oh, I don't think I could
sleep with this smell.

08:49.933 --> 08:51.333
Should we get a hotel room?

08:51.368 --> 08:53.635
Yes. I'll make a call.

08:53.671 --> 08:54.967
Something with a view. And robes.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.098
Ooh, robes.

08:56.123 --> 08:58.340
I think I know a much better place,

08:58.375 --> 09:00.475
and it's far more affordable.

09:00.511 --> 09:02.310
Family sleepover!

09:02.346 --> 09:03.659
Isn't this fun?

09:03.684 --> 09:05.213
It's even better than a hotel.

09:05.249 --> 09:08.216
We got sleeping bags and some
free floor French fries...

09:08.252 --> 09:09.217
Free floor ketchup.

09:09.253 --> 09:10.352
That's blood.

09:10.387 --> 09:11.831
And what if I told
you there's also a man

09:11.855 --> 09:13.221
looking at us through the window?

09:13.257 --> 09:15.657
- Even better.
- Oh, my God, it's Mr. Fischoeder.

09:15.693 --> 09:17.392
Uh, hi, Mr. Fischoeder.

09:17.428 --> 09:19.728
- Hi, Bob.
- Uh, if you're here for the rent,

09:19.770 --> 09:22.004
we don't have the checkbook down here.

09:22.032 --> 09:24.700
We also don't have the actual money.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.601
- Um, in the bank.
- Bob.

09:26.644 --> 09:30.045
Bob, it's, it's okay. 
I was, not here for that.

09:30.074 --> 09:32.708
I was... I was just on my
way to a brothel... uh...

09:32.743 --> 09:36.611
brothelizer, uh... uh, showcase.

09:36.647 --> 09:38.547
Uh... They're showing off this new thing

09:38.582 --> 09:41.450
that tests how much
broth you've, uh, drunk.

09:41.485 --> 09:43.393
- Well, that's...
- And anyway, and I saw you here

09:43.418 --> 09:46.582
in your pajamas and I thought,
well, what the hell is that?

09:46.607 --> 09:48.623
Uh, we lost an egg upstairs.

09:48.659 --> 09:50.525
"Lost an egg upstairs"?

09:50.561 --> 09:54.262
Is that an expression that, uh,
blue collar people use? Or...

09:54.298 --> 09:56.198
No, we hid the Easter eggs,

09:56.233 --> 09:59.101
and we can't find one of them
and it really smells up there.

09:59.136 --> 10:01.036
Oh, dear, well, I hope
we don't have to burn

10:01.071 --> 10:03.205
the whole building down
because of the smell.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.012
Well, that doesn't really happen.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.242
Oh, yes, it does, Bob.
Once certain smells set

10:07.277 --> 10:09.978
into a place, you simply
can't get them out.

10:10.013 --> 10:11.279
Maybe a hamster gets lost

10:11.315 --> 10:13.248
or Grandma dies on a hot day in August

10:13.283 --> 10:16.233
with a plate of potato
salad on her lap, say.

10:16.258 --> 10:17.358
Aw...

10:17.383 --> 10:18.998
And, uh, and rotten eggs?
Well, they're the worst.

10:19.022 --> 10:21.490
Landlords call them "fire starters."

10:21.525 --> 10:23.169
I-I'll try to remember
to give you a heads up

10:23.193 --> 10:25.894
before my friend Arson Daly stops by.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.295
Uh, we're gonna find the egg.

10:27.331 --> 10:28.930
Yeah, uh, we're gonna find it.

10:28.966 --> 10:30.932
It's just hidden really
well because I hid it.

10:30.968 --> 10:32.801
- I-I probably hid it.
- No.

10:32.836 --> 10:34.136
- I-I did.
- No, me.

10:34.171 --> 10:35.470
So one of you hid it,

10:35.506 --> 10:37.672
but neither of you knows where it is?

10:37.715 --> 10:39.615
- We had some schnapps.
- Quite a bit.

10:39.643 --> 10:41.244
Ah. Why didn't you say so?

10:41.269 --> 10:44.079
I lost the year 1996 to schnapps.

10:44.114 --> 10:46.348
I still don't know what the Macarena is.

10:46.383 --> 10:48.817
D-Don't tell me. I'll figure it out.

10:48.852 --> 10:50.485
We have to find that egg.

10:50.521 --> 10:52.754
- _
- Wow, it's really bad.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.256
It's unbelievably bad.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.658
There's so much egg in the
air, we could scramble it.

10:56.693 --> 10:58.493
Wait, Lin. What are you doing?

10:58.529 --> 11:00.962
I read online that if you are
trying to remember something,

11:00.998 --> 11:03.298
you should try to put yourself
back in the environment.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.467
And the environment
I was in was schnapps.

11:05.801 --> 11:07.602
Oh, God.

11:07.638 --> 11:09.204
Oh, my God.

11:09.239 --> 11:10.672
Bob, I'm getting something.

11:10.707 --> 11:12.874
Really? Yeah, I was here in the kitchen.

11:12.910 --> 11:14.376
Uh, yes, we live here.

11:14.411 --> 11:16.678
No, no, I was in the kitchen that night.

11:16.713 --> 11:19.781
Come on, Linda. Remember.

11:19.817 --> 11:23.485
♪ These eggs are hidden
and Linda is winnin' ♪

11:23.520 --> 11:26.555
♪ 'Cause she is the
best and Bob is a mess. ♪

11:26.590 --> 11:27.622
Air vent.

11:27.658 --> 11:29.157
I know where it is.

11:29.193 --> 11:30.959
Thanks for coming, Teddy.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.161
We opened the air vent,
but we couldn't see it.

11:33.197 --> 11:35.063
Oh, my God, the Sm...

11:35.098 --> 11:36.798
Ugh, Teddy, ugh, hurry.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.066
Must've rolled down the vent.

11:38.101 --> 11:39.234
Hold the ladder, Bob.

11:39.269 --> 11:40.735
- I'm getting in there.
- Okay.

11:40.771 --> 11:42.704
I'm just gonna reach back here and, uh,

11:42.739 --> 11:44.539
okay, I can feel something.

11:44.575 --> 11:46.174
Yep, that's definitely an egg.

11:46.210 --> 11:48.048
Oh, thank God. I knew it. I knew it.

11:48.073 --> 11:50.212
I just got to get a better grip.

11:52.382 --> 11:53.682
What? What? What?

11:53.717 --> 11:55.414
What?!

11:55.439 --> 11:57.519
- There's a monster in the wall!
- Oh, my God.

11:57.554 --> 12:02.009
Aah! Something's in there,
and it's got the egg.

12:02.226 --> 12:04.559
Oh. Are you guys gonna
be open for lunch today,

12:04.595 --> 12:06.715
or, uh, what's the story?

12:08.012 --> 12:10.604
Mmm, I'm telling you, that
thing had ahold of me good.

12:10.629 --> 12:11.761
What do you think it was?

12:11.797 --> 12:13.730
A bear maybe? Tiny dinosaur?

12:13.765 --> 12:15.098
I-I would doubt that.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.333
Maybe it was Aunt Gayle.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.808
Yeah, we haven't seen her in a while.

12:17.836 --> 12:19.447
She seems like she
could be a wall person.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.605
A Wahlberg so to speak?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.173
Are you guys serving lunch yet?

12:23.208 --> 12:25.275
I know it's a little early, but, uh...

12:25.310 --> 12:27.689
... I gave up beef for Lent and
I'm really excited to eat a...

12:28.947 --> 12:30.447
Is there a horrible smell in here?

12:30.482 --> 12:32.115
- No.
- Oh, God.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.036
There is up in our house.
Want to come smell it?

12:34.061 --> 12:35.952
- Five bucks.
- Uh, no, thank you.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.754
Oh, crap, crap, crap.

12:37.789 --> 12:39.623
It's in the restaurant.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.002
We're not even smelling it anymore.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.592
I-It's inside of us.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.294
We are the smell now.

12:44.329 --> 12:45.996
We have to close the restaurant.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.130
Close the restaurant?

12:47.165 --> 12:48.632
But it's Beef Boom.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.645
Lin, it's better to lose
business for a couple hours

12:50.669 --> 12:52.869
than be the place that
smells like rotten eggs

12:52.905 --> 12:54.504
and lose business forever.

12:54.539 --> 12:55.817
Is that from the Bible?

12:55.841 --> 12:57.641
Hey. Was that a scrabbling?

12:57.676 --> 12:58.887
That was definitely a scrabbling.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.644
It's Aunt Gayle. She's on the move.

13:00.835 --> 13:02.697
Wait a minute.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.881
That thing's in the crawlspace.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.283
That's why it smells down here.

13:06.318 --> 13:07.784
It's moving the egg around.

13:07.819 --> 13:09.519
Like I did to Mom in the womb.

13:09.554 --> 13:11.221
We got to call animal control.

13:11.256 --> 13:12.522
That'll take forever.

13:12.557 --> 13:14.157
Time is Beef Boom money.

13:14.192 --> 13:15.637
We've got to get that egg out of there.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.661
Listen, I-I-I know the crawlspace.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.496
We know. You tell us all the time.

13:19.531 --> 13:20.697
I'm gonna go in there,

13:20.732 --> 13:22.132
and I'm gonna try and get the egg.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.967
Because you know the crawlspace so well.

13:24.002 --> 13:25.568
- Yes.
- Dad, just one question.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.737
- Do you know the crawlspace?
- Okay, guys, I get it.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.139
Bob, I'm going with you.

13:29.174 --> 13:30.685
I'm worried you don't
know the crawlspace

13:30.709 --> 13:32.175
as well as you think you do.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.144
Uh, you only have one jumpsuit?

13:34.179 --> 13:35.745
What? I work for myself.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.814
What, do you think I carry
around an extra jumpsuit

13:37.849 --> 13:39.316
conveniently in your size?

13:39.351 --> 13:40.317
Is that what you think, Bobby?

13:40.352 --> 13:41.685
- I-I... it's fine.
- Huh?

13:41.720 --> 13:43.353
- No.
- Okay, I do.

13:43.388 --> 13:44.899
I was gonna give it to
you for your birthday

13:44.923 --> 13:46.890
and, uh, surprise you,
but it's in the truck.

13:46.925 --> 13:47.991
I'll go get it.

13:48.026 --> 13:49.759
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.194
What-What does it say on it?

13:51.229 --> 13:53.496
It says, "T.G.I.B." Thank God It's Bob.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.499
You get it? T.G.I... I
switched the "B" for an "F."

13:56.535 --> 13:58.068
- It's very clever.
- Yeah.

13:58.703 --> 14:01.738
Are you guys in there? Can you see it?

14:01.773 --> 14:04.507
Not yet. We're heading down 
to the restaurant level now.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.109
Okay, be careful.

14:06.144 --> 14:07.444
We'll meet you down there.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.845
- Dad?
- Yes, Tina.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.513
If you die in the wall,

14:10.549 --> 14:11.759
we'll name the restaurant after you.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.550
Tina, I'm not gonna die in here.

14:13.585 --> 14:15.518
That's right, Dad. Stay positive.

14:15.554 --> 14:18.088
Oh, God, it smells really,
really bad right here.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.522
We must be getting close.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.112
Let-Let's-Let's climb down.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.598
Oh, my God.

14:28.633 --> 14:29.766
What? What is it, Bob?

14:29.801 --> 14:31.134
Bob!

14:32.004 --> 14:33.339
Bob, what happened?

14:33.364 --> 14:35.550
I-I heard something hiss
right in front of my face,

14:35.574 --> 14:38.308
a-and I got scared, and then I fell.

14:38.343 --> 14:40.744
I-I-I fell-jumped gracefully.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.123
I'm coming to get you, Bobby.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.613
No, Teddy, stay up there.

14:43.648 --> 14:45.424
I-It's in between the floors.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.730
You jumped down.

14:46.771 --> 14:48.796
Yeah. I didn't want you
to be alone down here, Bobby.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.453
What's going on in there?

14:50.489 --> 14:51.755
Teddy was right.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.123
There's a horrible thing in here.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.891
So everything's fine?

14:54.926 --> 14:57.827
I'm gonna climb up and try
to see what it actually is.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.963
Oh, God. Oh. Mm.

14:59.998 --> 15:02.465
Oh, my God, it's a raccoon.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.268
A raccoon?! Which one? Describe it.

15:05.303 --> 15:07.604
Is it Little King Trash
Mouth and his husband Gary?

15:07.639 --> 15:11.775
Oh, right, I forgot you guys
are crazy raccoon people.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.444
What, just 'cause we watch
the raccoons in the alley?

15:14.479 --> 15:16.479
It's fun. It's like a soap opera.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.181
It's more like an HBO miniseries.

15:18.216 --> 15:19.916
Lots of plot twists, some nudity.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.618
You'd like it. You just got to catch up.

15:21.653 --> 15:22.709
Is it the king?

15:22.734 --> 15:25.755
No, it's definitely not
a him because it has babies.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.857
Oh, a gay raccoon can't have babies?

15:27.893 --> 15:29.492
Oh, I don't know.

15:29.528 --> 15:32.595
I guess he could adopt
or have a surrogate.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.030
Of course he could.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.098
What does it look like?

15:35.133 --> 15:36.699
It looks like a raccoon.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.536
Bob, coloring, marking,
hairdo, anything distinctive.

15:39.571 --> 15:44.075
Okay. Uh, well, it has
three black rings on its tail

15:44.100 --> 15:46.142
and its ear kind of has a notch in it.

15:46.178 --> 15:47.444
A gauge?

15:47.479 --> 15:49.145
Has that reached the raccoon community?

15:49.181 --> 15:51.648
It's Big Baby Pudding Snatcher.

15:51.683 --> 15:53.349
I was wondering where she went.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.652
Big Baby Pudding Snatcher. Of course.

15:55.687 --> 15:57.787
Why do you call her Big
Baby Pudding Snatcher?

15:57.823 --> 15:59.189
Why do you think, Bob?

15:59.224 --> 16:00.857
Pudding cups, she snatches them.

16:00.892 --> 16:01.858
From who?

16:01.893 --> 16:03.326
Me, in the alley.

16:03.361 --> 16:05.462
Why are you eating pudding in the alley?

16:05.497 --> 16:07.075
Where else am I gonna eat it, Bob?

16:07.099 --> 16:08.698
The bathroom? That's gross.

16:08.733 --> 16:11.367
Let me in there. I'll
reason with her, mom to mom.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.636
She's probably just
hormonal and not sleeping.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.506
And I'm sure she's worried that
her body may never bounce back.

16:16.541 --> 16:17.907
I don't think that's a good idea.

16:17.943 --> 16:19.809
She seems pretty angry.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.511
Uh, not to put us back on topic,

16:21.546 --> 16:23.513
but did you happen to see the egg?

16:23.548 --> 16:25.892
Right. L-Let me look again.

16:25.917 --> 16:29.152
Uh, hi. Sorry to bother you.

16:29.187 --> 16:31.482
Uh, congratulations, by the way.

16:31.507 --> 16:33.656
What a beautiful family you have.

16:33.692 --> 16:36.059
I was just looking for an egg, so...

16:36.094 --> 16:37.894
I see it. I see the egg.

16:37.929 --> 16:39.362
I'm gonna try and get it.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.098
Oh, bad idea!

16:42.134 --> 16:44.100
Okay, I think we have a problem.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.828
W-We're-We're not getting that egg.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.248
We're gonna have to
burn the building down

16:47.272 --> 16:48.605
with Teddy and me inside.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.772
As long as we're together.

16:49.808 --> 16:50.918
We'll mix your ashes together

16:50.942 --> 16:53.472
and make a manly potpourri.

16:54.527 --> 16:56.838
- I miss Dad.
- I'm right here, Tina.

16:56.863 --> 16:58.229
I know, but it's not the same.

16:58.264 --> 16:59.575
Listen, I need you to find out

16:59.599 --> 17:01.199
how to lure raccoons out of a wall

17:01.234 --> 17:02.533
so I can grab the egg.

17:02.569 --> 17:04.535
Somebody, get the laptop.

17:04.570 --> 17:07.003
Look up "raccoon, babies, wall."

17:07.040 --> 17:09.207
Are you sure we want that
in our search history?

17:09.242 --> 17:11.742
There's such a thing as
search history? Uh-oh.

17:11.778 --> 17:13.044
Uh, I'll-I'll get it.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.423
I'll get the computer. I'll be, uh...

17:14.446 --> 17:15.713
I might be a minute.

17:15.749 --> 17:17.915
He looks at a lot of
exotic candy online.

17:17.951 --> 17:19.751
Okay, I think I've got something.

17:19.786 --> 17:22.353
This site says you can
sometimes drive raccoons out

17:22.387 --> 17:24.492
by using what they
call "mild harassment."

17:24.518 --> 17:25.423
Keep talking.

17:25.458 --> 17:28.392
Um, they suggest loud
music and flashing lights.

17:28.428 --> 17:30.762
Mm, that doesn't work
to get me out of the tub.

17:30.797 --> 17:32.575
♪ Amadeus, Amadeus ♪

17:32.599 --> 17:35.399
♪ Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus ♪

17:35.435 --> 17:38.035

17:38.071 --> 17:40.204

17:40.240 --> 17:41.917
♪ Come and rock me, Amadeus ♪
♪ Rock me, Amadeus... ♪

17:41.941 --> 17:43.174
Are they leaving, Dad?

17:43.209 --> 17:45.510
No. Can we try another station?

17:45.545 --> 17:46.622
No, no, no. It's good.

17:46.646 --> 17:48.112
After this one we can change it.

17:48.148 --> 17:49.947
Are you flashing the light?

17:49.983 --> 17:51.949
I'm flashing it. I'm-I'm shaking it.

17:51.985 --> 17:53.251
It's not working.

17:53.286 --> 17:55.186
Is there anything else we can try?

17:55.221 --> 17:56.921
It's not the end of the world, Dad.

17:56.956 --> 17:58.923
This site says they
will move on their own.

17:58.958 --> 18:00.291
What? That's great.

18:00.326 --> 18:02.360
Once the babies are nine weeks old.

18:02.395 --> 18:03.528
How old are they, Dad?

18:03.563 --> 18:05.429
I-I don't know, Tina.

18:05.465 --> 18:07.131
They're small babies.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.101
Okay, great. So in one to eight
weeks, this'll all be over.

18:10.136 --> 18:12.804
Ugh, so the only option
is to go grab the egg,

18:12.839 --> 18:15.406
and get my face scratched
off by a rabid raccoon?

18:15.441 --> 18:17.074
We'll get you a better face.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.587
You'll finally make sense with Mom.

18:18.611 --> 18:21.145
She's not rabid, Bob. She's a mom.

18:21.181 --> 18:23.981
She's looking out for her
kids. It's not her fault.

18:24.017 --> 18:26.250
You're right, Lin. It's your fault!

18:26.286 --> 18:27.819
What?! My fault?

18:27.854 --> 18:29.921
Yes! You put an egg in a vent!

18:29.956 --> 18:31.801
You're just mad 'cause 
that's my egg in there,

18:31.825 --> 18:32.990
and I won and you know it.

18:33.026 --> 18:35.126
No, this isn't a win.

18:35.161 --> 18:37.150
You don't get to win when you cheated.

18:37.175 --> 18:40.064
Guys, don't you see?
This is tearing us apart.

18:40.099 --> 18:41.666
Bob, you're ruining the egg hunt.

18:41.701 --> 18:42.900
No, you are!

18:42.936 --> 18:45.136
Stop! You both ruined it!

18:45.171 --> 18:47.138
The egg hunt isn't fun for us!

18:47.173 --> 18:49.106
It's all about your stupid competition.

18:49.142 --> 18:50.575
We don't like it!

18:50.610 --> 18:52.443
Louise, I never.

18:52.478 --> 18:54.979
And Tina and Gene feel the same way.

18:55.014 --> 18:56.480
Okay, she's right, we do.

18:56.516 --> 18:58.749
- What?
- You don't like the egg hunt?

18:58.785 --> 19:02.019
It's not that we don't like
it, it's just that we hate it.

19:02.055 --> 19:03.369
You hate it?

19:04.135 --> 19:06.357
Um, are we supposed to like it?

19:06.392 --> 19:08.125
I mean, are Easter egg hunts for kids?

19:08.161 --> 19:09.994
We thought they were for grown-ups.

19:10.029 --> 19:13.164
Well, then why do you kids do
it then if you hate it so much?

19:13.199 --> 19:15.025
Because it seems like
it makes you happy,

19:15.050 --> 19:17.101
and even though it makes us unhappy,

19:17.136 --> 19:18.669
we do it and we hate it.

19:18.705 --> 19:20.638
Aw, that's sweet.

19:20.673 --> 19:22.039
Well, I do it for the candy.

19:22.075 --> 19:25.209
Okay, 75% candy, 25% you guys.

19:25.245 --> 19:28.446
I would never eat candy
that was 25% you guys.

19:28.481 --> 19:30.548
Maybe you definitely have a point.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.651
We might have gotten carried
away with our egg competition.

19:33.686 --> 19:35.686
I mean, I'm stuck in
a wall with a raccoon,

19:35.722 --> 19:38.890
and Mr. Fischoeder is gonna
burn down our apartment.

19:38.925 --> 19:41.525
So, no more Easter egg hunt?

19:41.561 --> 19:43.234
That's a little extreme.

19:43.259 --> 19:45.963
Maybe we could just cut
back a little, you know?

19:45.999 --> 19:47.698
Yeah, just hide, like, three eggs.

19:47.734 --> 19:49.901
Uh, guys, I'm really glad 
we worked this all out,

19:49.936 --> 19:52.370
but I'm still in a wall
with an angry raccoon

19:52.405 --> 19:54.071
and a very disgusting egg.

19:54.107 --> 19:55.591
And me, your best friend.

19:55.616 --> 19:58.409
Right, right, right, the egg
and Big Baby Pudding Snatcher.

19:58.444 --> 19:59.911
That's it.

19:59.946 --> 20:00.946
- What?
- Pudding.

20:03.249 --> 20:06.517
Teddy, I got the
boards up like you said!

20:06.552 --> 20:07.852
Great job, Linda!

20:07.887 --> 20:09.086
I knew you'd be good at it.

20:09.122 --> 20:10.554
You've got floorboard hands.

20:10.590 --> 20:11.822
Thank you!

20:11.858 --> 20:13.891
Okay, everybody. Open your pudding cups.

20:13.927 --> 20:15.493
And drop!

20:15.528 --> 20:17.228
Pudding in the hole!

20:17.263 --> 20:19.983
I hear her, she's coming.

20:23.045 --> 20:24.335
Dad, now!

20:24.370 --> 20:25.403
We did it!

20:25.438 --> 20:28.372
We're free! We're free!

20:28.408 --> 20:30.374
Oh, God, this egg.

20:30.410 --> 20:32.109
Ugh! The smell.

20:32.145 --> 20:34.512
Give it to me. I'll
take it to the ocean.

20:34.547 --> 20:37.048
Out of the way. Rotten egg.

20:38.885 --> 20:40.017
Where's Teddy going?

20:40.053 --> 20:41.686
To throw the egg in the ocean.

20:41.721 --> 20:42.887
It's the circle of life.

20:42.922 --> 20:44.689
I can still smell it.

20:44.724 --> 20:46.402
Dad, you're gonna have
to burn that jumpsuit.

20:46.426 --> 20:48.359
Hey, we should burn
all of Dad's clothes.

20:48.394 --> 20:51.896
Ooh! Fun fashion bonfire, yes, baby.

20:51.931 --> 20:54.398
- No.
- Yeah, and in your face, Bob, I won.
