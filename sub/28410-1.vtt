00:01.543 --> 00:04.462
{\an5}SAMIR:
<i>It's crazy times, guys,</i>
<i>crazy times.</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:06.131
So one side is saying,

00:06.214 --> 00:09.134
"Hey, people are killing
each other with machine guns.

00:09.217 --> 00:12.721
"Maybe normal civilians
shouldn't have machine guns,

00:12.804 --> 00:16.599
and only soldiers who are
in an active ground war."

00:16.683 --> 00:18.560
And then the other side
is saying,

00:18.643 --> 00:19.936
"Well, you can't
take away machine guns

00:20.019 --> 00:21.813
"because of
the Second Amendment.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.441
"The Second Amendment,
you can't regulate guns

00:24.524 --> 00:26.443
because of
the Second Amendment."

00:26.526 --> 00:29.446
So, to be clear,
your argument is

00:29.529 --> 00:32.323
that guns should have
no regulations on them

00:32.406 --> 00:34.033
because of the Second Amendment,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.619
which literally starts
with the words,

00:36.703 --> 00:40.248
"A well regulated."

00:40.331 --> 00:41.833
That's literally how it starts!

00:41.916 --> 00:45.420
And the whole amendment
has 27 words,

00:45.503 --> 00:48.840
and three of them
are "a," "well,"

00:48.923 --> 00:51.259
and "regulated."

00:51.342 --> 00:53.928
That's 11.1%, folks.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.430
(light laughter)

00:55.513 --> 00:56.431
{\an1}You know?

00:56.514 --> 00:57.807
I know what this guy's thinking.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.602
This guy's like, "But, Samir,

01:00.685 --> 01:02.312
11.1% isn't that much."

01:02.395 --> 01:04.813
But imagine you're on a plane,

01:04.897 --> 01:07.150
and halfway through your
journey, the pilot comes on

01:07.233 --> 01:08.693
and he's like, "Hey, folks.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.487
"Classic good news, bad news.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.697
"Good news, we'll be getting you

01:12.781 --> 01:15.116
89% of the way there.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.868
Bad news, that puts us

01:16.951 --> 01:19.287
at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.997
(light laughter)

01:23.583 --> 01:26.961
(throats clearing)

01:29.214 --> 01:30.465
(man sighs)

01:30.548 --> 01:34.010
All right.
That's my time. Thank you.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.012
(indistinct chatter)

01:40.058 --> 01:42.185
Hey, Al.
Uh, something cheap and brown.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.436
No ice.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.525
{\an3}(ice clinking,
drink pours)

01:48.608 --> 01:50.151
{\an1}JOE:
Looking good, Tiff. Huh?

01:50.235 --> 01:52.195
{\an4}Special occasion, huh?
Come on.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.195
Perfect. Thank you.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.696
{\an1}WOMAN:
Leave me alone.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.573
{\an1}JOE: Let me try
some new stuff on you.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.660
{\an1}Hey, why do they call me
the gravedigger, huh?

01:58.743 --> 02:00.537
{\an1}'Cause I'd like to
bury my face in those boobs.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.081
{\an4}(laughing)

02:00.620 --> 02:03.081
{\an3}Okay. Okay.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.667
{\an1}Okay, here's some advice
if you want some:

02:05.750 --> 02:07.752
{\an1}maybe you should try
putting some <i> jokes</i> in there.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.380
Yeah, well, I don't want to do
jokes about cats versus dogs,

02:10.463 --> 02:11.422
and New York versus L.A.,

02:11.506 --> 02:13.967
{\an3}and airline food, and
ethnic stereotypes, okay?

02:14.050 --> 02:15.969
Didi? If you don't
make people think,

02:16.052 --> 02:17.887
{\an3}your comedy's never
going to matter.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.722
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.766
People <i> like</i> my act, okay?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.602
{\an5}I have 59,000 followers.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.602
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.688
{\an3}So I should be
more like Joe Donner

02:26.771 --> 02:28.356
{\an5}and murder some people?

02:26.771 --> 02:28.356
MAN: Come on, what?

02:28.439 --> 02:31.359
{\an4}Come on, you and me
and a bottle of beer.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.359
WOMAN: No, thanks.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.694
Come on, baby.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.362
Come on, he didn't.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.114
{\an3}He didn't.

02:36.197 --> 02:39.617
What? (laughing)

02:39.701 --> 02:42.537
The legal system ruled
it wasn't murder.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.955
Yeah, they fucked that up.

02:44.038 --> 02:44.789
But you know what?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.375
That is exactly
your problem, Samir.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.543
Funny is funny.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.586
And that dude--

02:49.669 --> 02:52.088
not you, but that dude--

02:52.171 --> 02:53.089
is funny.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.092
Okay?

02:56.175 --> 02:57.927
No, that's...

02:58.845 --> 03:00.013
Okay. Well, good talk.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.639
{\an3}Hey, could you put
that all in an e-mail

03:01.723 --> 03:03.057
{\an3}and, uh, send it
to the ocean?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.435
Yeah, sure.
Hey, could you suck my vagina?

03:05.518 --> 03:06.853
{\an1}(laughing)

03:07.729 --> 03:10.148
What matters is
not followers.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.567
{\an5}What matters is adjusted...

03:10.231 --> 03:12.567
Gross income.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.612
Yeah, we all know
that JC Wheel...

03:15.695 --> 03:18.281
JC Wheeler.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.284
Ah. In the fleshy flesh.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.452
Oh, man, I--

03:22.535 --> 03:23.828
Hey, can-- hey,

03:23.912 --> 03:26.831
{\an3}I am such
a fan of yours.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.334
I mean, I know everyone's a fan
of yours, but I'm the...

03:29.417 --> 03:31.461
{\an4}Thank you.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.461
How's your day?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.004
What've you been doing?

03:33.087 --> 03:36.132
{\an3}Man. You were everywhere
and then you just disappeared.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.176
You had it all.
What happened?

03:38.259 --> 03:40.970
I had it all.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.933
{\an5}Hey, I saw your set.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.933
Oh, you did?

03:45.016 --> 03:48.019
{\an3}Oh, man-- feel free to
tell me to go fuck myself,

03:48.102 --> 03:49.812
but if you have
any notes for me

03:49.896 --> 03:51.481
{\an3}or anything,
I'll give you anything.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.899
I'll give you my dog.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.151
{\an3}Well, it's not my dog.
It's my girlfriend's dog.

03:55.234 --> 03:56.527
{\an3}But we've been dating
since high school,

03:56.611 --> 03:57.862
so it's basically my dog.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.322
{\an3}My dog, her dog.
Dog's a dog.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.531
Your dog if you want it.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.825
See, all this shit is funny.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.036
{\an1}Funnier than the Second
Amendment, I'll tell you that.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.747
{\an3}Well, obviously, it's not
the amendment that's funny.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.332
{\an3}What I find funny
is the fraudulent...

04:09.415 --> 04:10.458
Next.

04:10.541 --> 04:11.459
What?

04:11.542 --> 04:13.544
Next topic.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.005
{\an3}(chuckles)
That's funny.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.548
{\an3}But seriously,
if you have any notes

04:17.632 --> 04:18.548
for me, you know...

04:18.632 --> 04:20.301
You want notes?

04:18.632 --> 04:20.301
{\an3}Yeah.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.844
Fuck politics.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.014
The audience don't care
about what you <i> think.</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:26.683
They care about <i> you.</i>

04:26.766 --> 04:27.850
{\an3}Right.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.227
Yeah, I know
everyone says

04:29.310 --> 04:30.687
{\an3}be personal,
truth in comedy,

04:30.770 --> 04:33.356
{\an3}but don't you think
that's a bit of a cop-out?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.817
The audience doesn't want
to hear you make points.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.485
{\an1}You dating
a high school girl?

04:37.568 --> 04:39.362
{\an5}Now <i> that's</i> interesting.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.362
{\an3}Oh.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.989
{\an3}I'm not dating a
high school girl. We...

04:41.072 --> 04:43.324
Now that's comedy.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.660
{\an3}Right, but isn't that
gross and exhibitionistic?

04:45.743 --> 04:47.870
{\an3}Isn't the whole point
to provide insight

04:47.954 --> 04:49.539
into the human condition?

04:49.622 --> 04:51.582
Provide insight, huh.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.003
What do you want?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.671
{\an1}Are you happy
with your life?

04:56.754 --> 04:57.839
With your career?

04:57.922 --> 05:00.091
Don't you want it all?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.471
Yes. More than anything.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.726
You have one thing.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.519
One natural resource.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.856
You are a country
with one export.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.567
And you are the export.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.777
I'll tell you a secret.

05:19.861 --> 05:24.073
{\an1}Put yourself out there
and you <i> will</i> get laughs.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.868
You <i> will</i> be successful.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.371
{\an1}Are you sure...
that's what you want?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.915
{\an3}Yes.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.792
{\an1}Now you have to be sure
to be sure.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.586
{\an1}'Cause once you put it
out there...

05:36.669 --> 05:40.048
{\an1}the audience will take it in.
They will connect.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.551
And once they connect to it...

05:43.634 --> 05:44.719
it's theirs.

05:44.802 --> 05:47.388
And once it's theirs...

05:47.472 --> 05:50.600
that shit is gone forever.

05:52.477 --> 05:56.564
Listen, my life is okay.
It's fine.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.275
But you don't choose comedy
because you want a fine life,

05:59.358 --> 06:03.321
you choose comedy
because you want it all.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.782
Hmm.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.328
Well, okay, then.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.130
{\an5}(loud laughter)

06:19.003 --> 06:21.130
Right? Right?

06:21.214 --> 06:25.134
{\an5}(cheers and applause)

06:21.214 --> 06:25.134
{\an3}And let me tell you,
your next guest

06:25.218 --> 06:26.636
needs no introduction.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.470
I'm Joe Donner.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.806
And you're a bunch
of fucking idiots!

06:29.889 --> 06:31.641
(cheering and applause)

06:31.724 --> 06:34.852
(belches, blows)

06:41.901 --> 06:43.861
(microphone feedback)

06:46.072 --> 06:49.784
Hi, everybody. Hi.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.162
{\an1}So, the Second Amendment,
which people use to justify

06:53.246 --> 06:55.289
having their, uh, uh,

06:55.373 --> 06:57.708
having no regulations
on guns, um,

06:57.792 --> 07:02.338
{\an3}actually begins with the
words, "A well regulated."

07:02.421 --> 07:04.423
(microphone feedback)

07:04.507 --> 07:07.260
11.1 perc-- percent
of the whole thing.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.726
I wish you could all see
your own faces right now.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.229
You have the exact expression
that my dog has

07:18.312 --> 07:19.814
when she's taking a shit.

07:19.897 --> 07:20.857
(laughter)

07:24.402 --> 07:26.195
Like, "Don't look at me."

07:26.279 --> 07:28.865
"Why are you here
watching this?"

07:28.948 --> 07:32.201
{\an5}(laughter)

07:28.948 --> 07:32.201
"There has to be a better way
to do this."

07:35.788 --> 07:38.833
Okay. Okay, you want
to talk about this?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.251
Okay, I-I love my dog.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.504
The other day,
she peed on my pizza.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.006
(laughter)

07:45.089 --> 07:46.340
But that's my fault.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.050
I shouldn't have yelled at her

07:48.134 --> 07:50.011
while she was standing
on my pizza.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.054
(laughter)

07:52.138 --> 07:55.224
(applause)

07:55.308 --> 07:57.059
But I-- She's cool.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.061
Um, her name is Cat.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.771
(laughter)

08:00.855 --> 08:02.899
Which I know <i> sounds</i> like
a stupid name for a dog,

08:02.982 --> 08:06.861
but that's only because it is
a stupid name for a dog.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.404
(laughter)

08:08.487 --> 08:11.240
It's even stupider
when you realize

08:11.324 --> 08:14.035
it's actually short
for Cat-erpillar.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.454
(loud laughter and applause)

08:20.958 --> 08:22.919
(people whooping)

08:46.025 --> 08:47.693
(drops keys)

08:53.157 --> 08:55.952
(whispering): Cat.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.121
Cat. Come here, baby.

08:59.205 --> 09:03.501
(clicking tongue)
Cat. Cat.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.837
Cat?

09:18.015 --> 09:19.475
{\an3}Hey, Rena?

09:19.558 --> 09:20.851
I really killed tonight.

09:20.935 --> 09:25.273
{\an5}It's my best set ever.

09:20.935 --> 09:25.273
(exhales) Mm.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.565
That's great.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.110
{\an3}They were laughing at
stuff I was saying,

09:29.193 --> 09:30.486
at the punch lines.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.114
{\an3}And at the end, they
cheered so hard, I was like,

09:33.197 --> 09:34.949
{\an3}"What's that?"
and I was like, "Oh,

09:35.032 --> 09:36.659
that's for me."

09:36.742 --> 09:38.869
{\an3}I've never felt
anything like it.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.832
Hey, where's Cat?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.834
{\an1}Huh?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.295
{\an3}No, you just sleep.
I'm gonna go walk the dog,

09:47.378 --> 09:48.462
but I can't find her.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.549
Oh, I thought you said "dog."

09:51.632 --> 09:54.844
{\an3}Yeah. Cat.
Where's Cat?

09:54.927 --> 09:57.596
{\an3}Oh, my God, you didn't
leave the door open, did you?

09:59.056 --> 10:01.183
Or the window?

10:01.267 --> 10:03.686
I don't know what this game is,
Samir, but I'm trying to sleep.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.647
Our dog, Rena.
Where's our dog?

10:06.731 --> 10:07.732
What?

10:07.815 --> 10:10.985
We don't have a dog
or a cat, Samir.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.029
You're so annoying.

10:25.499 --> 10:30.004
{\an5}NARRATOR:
<i>Samir Wassan is an artist</i>
<i>of great principle.</i>

10:30.087 --> 10:33.007
<i>A man who refuses</i>
<i>to compromise his beliefs</i>

10:33.090 --> 10:35.051
for a cheap joke.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.346
But tonight, he felt
the rush of the limelight

10:38.429 --> 10:40.681
for the first time.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.767
Now, he'll have to decide

10:42.850 --> 10:46.812
what really matters to him
when the laughter stops.

10:46.896 --> 10:51.108
And how much he's willing
to give... to The Twilight Zone.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.612
<i>(The Twilight Zone</i> theme
playing)

10:54.695 --> 10:56.238
NARRATOR: <i> You're traveling</i>
<i>through another dimension,</i>

10:56.322 --> 10:59.784
<i>a dimension not only of</i>
<i>sight and sound but of mind.</i>

10:59.867 --> 11:03.037
<i>It is the middle ground</i>
<i>between light and shadow,</i>

11:03.120 --> 11:05.790
<i>between science</i>
<i>and superstition.</i>

11:05.873 --> 11:08.501
{\an8}<i>And it lies between</i>
<i>the pit of one's fears</i>

11:08.584 --> 11:11.128
{\an8}<i>and the summit</i>
<i>of one's knowledge.</i>

11:11.212 --> 11:14.298
<i>You are now traveling through</i>
<i>a dimension of imagination.</i>

11:14.382 --> 11:18.636
<i>You've just crossed over</i>
<i>into The Twilight Zone.</i>

11:25.684 --> 11:27.311
{\an8}DEVEN:
What happened to that bus stop?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.730
{\an8}SAMIR: There's a very bad man
who's another comic here,

11:29.814 --> 11:31.941
{\an8}he got drunk and drove into it.
People died.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.984
{\an8}Anyway, could you give me
a hand here?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.446
{\an9}Is this a part
of your act?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.615
{\an7}No. I had to google
Jack Russell Terriers

11:39.698 --> 11:42.076
{\an7}because I couldn't find
any pictures of Cat on my phone,

11:42.159 --> 11:42.993
{\an8}which is so strange,

11:43.077 --> 11:44.870
{\an7}'cause I take pictures of her
all the time.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.123
{\an9}I don't get it.
Who's Cat?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.166
{\an8}Oh, okay.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.626
{\an8}Rena put you up to this.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.586
{\an8}Okay. Okay.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.586
{\an9}What?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.922
{\an9}What? No. I like
seeing you do stand-up.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.425
{\an9}You know what?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.176
{\an9}You and Rena do
your hilarious prank.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.302
{\an8}It's very funny.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.846
{\an8}Very funny.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.472
{\an7}Come on.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.683
{\an8}(jazz music playing)

12:08.394 --> 12:10.813
{\an7}Hey, uh, is JC Wheeler
here today?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.648
{\an8}(chuckles):
Yeah, right.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.358
{\an8}That sign's so funny.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.985
{\an8}"No apostrophes."

12:16.068 --> 12:19.280
{\an7}Yeah, you might be
the target audience.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.656
{\an8}I don't get it.

12:20.739 --> 12:21.991
{\an9}'Cause the club's
called Eddies,

12:22.074 --> 12:24.618
{\an8}but you'd think that
it would be Eddie's.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.287
{\an8}But then this sign's
saying that,

12:26.370 --> 12:28.372
{\an8}no, it <i> is</i> actually Eddie's,

12:28.456 --> 12:32.001
{\an8}it's just that we don't allow
apostrophes, so now it's Eddies.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.544
{\an8}That <i> is</i> funny.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.171
{\an8}Yeah, it's really clever.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.339
{\an9}DIDI:
Hey, girls.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.883
{\an9}What is this?
Community service?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.301
{\an8}Oh, this is Deven, my nephew.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.469
{\an8}He's, uh, staying with me.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.053
{\an8}Actually, I'm Rena's nephew.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.014
{\an8}Oh, shit!

12:45.097 --> 12:46.348
{\an8}He said check your lane.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.808
{\an8}He did not say
"check your lane."

12:47.892 --> 12:49.226
{\an8}He said check
your bitch-ass lane.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.145
{\an8}SAMIR: Don't say the--
any of the bad words.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.813
{\an8}He's staying with us.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.190
{\an8}He's in from out of town.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.524
{\an8}Hey, handsome.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.737
{\an8}So, you seen Uncle Samir
do his "comedy" before,

12:59.820 --> 13:02.990
{\an8}or is this the first time
you've had the "privilege"?

13:03.073 --> 13:05.284
{\an8}I've seen him do it
a couple of times,

13:05.367 --> 13:07.036
{\an9}but you know, you're
actually kind of

13:07.119 --> 13:08.996
{\an9}what made me want to be
a stand-up comic.

13:09.079 --> 13:09.955
{\an8}Just like you.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.999
{\an7}Oh, that's so nice.
Thank you for telling me.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.250
{\an7}DEVEN:
Well, I mean,

13:13.334 --> 13:15.920
{\an8}not <i> just</i> like you.
I kind of want to be, like...

13:16.003 --> 13:19.089
{\an8}you know, a <i> good</i> comedian?

13:19.173 --> 13:22.510
{\an9}Oh, shit!

13:19.173 --> 13:22.510
{\an7}Language.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.179
{\an8}Nephew's funny, dude.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.179
{\an7}All right.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.680
{\an8}Okay, um, I got to use
the restroom

13:26.764 --> 13:27.932
{\an8}before I get up on stage.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.851
{\an9}Why don't you just take a shit
on stage like you did last time?

13:30.935 --> 13:37.441
{\an8}And three of the 27 words are,
"A well regulated."

13:37.525 --> 13:40.528
{\an8}(phones chiming)

13:47.493 --> 13:50.704
{\an8}Geez. You know what?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.414
{\an8}Maybe I'll pull out
my phone, too.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.750
{\an8}Maybe we can text, you know?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.418
{\an8}What's everyone's phone number?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.754
{\an8}You guys are just like
my nephew.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.381
{\an8}I can only get through to him

14:00.464 --> 14:04.009
{\an8}if I text him.

14:00.464 --> 14:04.009
{\an8}(laughter)

14:08.347 --> 14:09.431
{\an8}Yeah.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.725
Hey,

14:11.809 --> 14:13.727
{\an4}asshole.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.727
(laughter)

14:13.811 --> 14:15.646
{\an1}Get off your phone,
I'm talking about you.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.899
(applause and laughter)

14:18.983 --> 14:21.652
He's ten years old, he's ten,

14:21.735 --> 14:25.072
and he was making fun of my act
earlier tonight.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.490
{\an1}He was!

14:26.574 --> 14:28.450
He was saying I'm not funny.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.452
{\an1}He's ten.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.621
Actually,
he's not even my nephew.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.665
I don't know if that
makes it better or worse.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.417
No, it actually makes it worse

14:36.500 --> 14:38.752
'cause if he was my nephew,
at least the family

14:38.836 --> 14:40.296
would be coming out on top,

14:40.379 --> 14:43.966
{\an5}but this way...

14:40.379 --> 14:43.966
(applause)

14:44.049 --> 14:47.469
This way, just some random
ten-year-old is dunking on me.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.887
(laughter)

14:50.848 --> 14:54.268
Deven Singh, everyone.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.437
Give it up for Deven Singh.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.023
(applause and cheering)

15:05.529 --> 15:07.823
{\an1}MAN: Congrats, man.
That was awesome.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.951
Damn. You brought it.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.329
That was actually a good set.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.706
Thanks to Deven.
Have you seen him, by the way?

15:15.789 --> 15:17.625
I hope I didn't
embarrass him too much.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.627
Okay, who are we
talking about right now?

15:19.710 --> 15:23.172
My nephew, my girlfriend's
nephew. Wants to be a comedian,

15:23.255 --> 15:25.007
but better than me.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.884
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,

15:26.967 --> 15:28.677
but I think I just hit

15:28.761 --> 15:31.096
my Samir limit.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.148
{\an3}Hey, did you guys see
a little boy come out here?

15:41.231 --> 15:42.816
{\an3}Did you guys see
a little boy,

15:42.900 --> 15:44.693
like, a ten-year-old boy
come out here at all?

15:44.777 --> 15:45.778
{\an3}WOMAN:
Haven't seen him. Sorry.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.530
{\an3}Hey, did you guys see
a little boy come out here?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.533
{\an6}Like, a leather jacket,
he's Indian?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.533
Sorry, dude.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.661
{\an1}Deven?

15:57.247 --> 15:58.916
Deven!

16:01.210 --> 16:03.587
{\an5}Call Deven Singh.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.587
(phone chimes)

16:03.671 --> 16:05.547
{\an5}AUTOMATED VOICE:
Did you mean Anisha Singh?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.549
Call Deven Singh.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
{\an5}(phone chimes)

16:07.633 --> 16:09.176
AUTOMATED VOICE: Okay.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.346
{\an5}No, no, no. Call Deven.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.346
(phone chimes)

16:12.429 --> 16:14.848
{\an5}AUTOMATED VOICE: I don't see
"Deven" in your contacts.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.518
{\an5}Should I look for locations
by that name?

16:17.601 --> 16:19.311
(phone chimes)

16:33.325 --> 16:35.285
♪ ♪

16:49.508 --> 16:51.593
Hey, have you heard from...

16:51.677 --> 16:54.054
You see, the laws...

16:54.138 --> 16:56.223
Samir. It's lovely to see you.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.225
{\an3}RENA: Hey, baby.
How was your show?

16:58.308 --> 17:00.310
I didn't know you were gonna
have company tonight.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.939
We were just talking
about comedy.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.941
I was making the case
that it is art,

17:06.023 --> 17:07.108
just as much as theater,

17:07.192 --> 17:10.445
or literature,
or paintings.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.905
Hold on one second, David.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.324
You know, I have a lot
of respect for what you do.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.410
Thank you.

17:16.492 --> 17:19.079
Um, can I talk to you
real quick? It's about Deven.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.457
{\an6}Who?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.457
Deven. Can we talk
over here, please?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
Who's Deven again?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.335
{\an5}Is that Fran's boyfriend?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.335
Deven. Your sister's son.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.506
I don't like that joke.
You know Anisha can't have kids.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.467
But that's just it, see?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.636
{\an3}Comedy has to go to these
dark places because

17:34.720 --> 17:36.972
{\an5}it's art.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.972
That is bullshit.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.683
{\an5}He's in this picture right here.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.683
What I'm saying is,

17:39.767 --> 17:41.477
{\an3}if he doesn't push
the boundaries,

17:41.560 --> 17:43.020
{\an1}(fading):
he's as derelict...

17:43.103 --> 17:44.271
{\an3}...if I were to let
an innocent man

17:44.354 --> 17:46.940
{\an3}go to prison. It really
is no different.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.442
{\an1}Don't you remember?
He was in this picture.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.861
{\an1}He was wearing that leather
jacket and I made fun of him.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.031
I called him The Fonz,
and he was like,

17:54.114 --> 17:56.366
"Who's that? You're so old."

18:02.206 --> 18:03.165
Baby...

18:09.630 --> 18:11.507
He's just gone.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.467
Anisha never
even had him.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.428
{\an1}Oh, my God, now you're
worrying about my sister?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.890
You're right.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.975
You-You-You're right,

18:22.059 --> 18:24.478
I shouldn't be worrying
about her 'cause-- (stammers)

18:24.561 --> 18:27.523
there never was a Deven,
so it's not like he's dead.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.899
He just never existed,

18:28.982 --> 18:30.526
so it's not like I killed him.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.694
Okay, now you're scaring me.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.987
{\an1}Are you all right,
Samir?

18:34.071 --> 18:35.072
What happened tonight?

18:35.155 --> 18:37.157
Are you feeling okay?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.575
{\an3}SAMIR:
It was JC Wheeler.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.827
JC Wheeler told me...

18:39.910 --> 18:41.370
{\an1}Whoa, whoa,
you met JC Wheeler?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.330
{\an3}Yeah, he was at
the club last night.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.373
That is so cool.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.000
JC Wheeler told me I need
to put myself out there,

18:47.084 --> 18:48.919
{\an3}that I need to be
more personal on stage,

18:49.002 --> 18:50.420
{\an3}and then people would
connect to it,

18:50.504 --> 18:52.673
and then people
would relate to me,

18:52.756 --> 18:56.468
and then... (gasps)

18:56.552 --> 18:58.846
it would be gone forever.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.726
Please don't put me
in the mental hospital.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.729
Why the mental hospital?

19:07.813 --> 19:10.274
You got one picked out?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.569
{\an1}(laughs)

19:13.652 --> 19:15.946
{\an1}There he is.
There's my guy.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.239
It's okay, Samir.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.783
Look, I think what
you're describing

19:19.867 --> 19:21.118
might be a good thing.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.037
The feeling that if you
put something out there

19:24.121 --> 19:26.206
{\an1}from your real life,
you'll get laughs.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.250
That sounds like
therapy to me.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.418
{\an1}You work through
these things

19:29.501 --> 19:31.295
{\an1}so that you could
free yourself from them.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.714
{\an1}It's terrifying to put
yourself out there,

19:33.797 --> 19:35.424
but it's true
what they say,

19:35.507 --> 19:38.385
{\an1}"Sunlight really is
the best disinfectant."

19:38.468 --> 19:41.263
Okay, okay, David,
I'm-I'm sorry. Would you mind?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.390
{\an5}Oh, say no more.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.390
(chuckles)

19:43.473 --> 19:44.975
(clicks tongue)

19:49.271 --> 19:50.898
{\an1}(sighs)

19:50.981 --> 19:55.277
You have been at this
for five years, five.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.945
{\an1}And I've been
very supportive,

19:57.029 --> 19:58.405
{\an1}but if you've finally
found the thing

19:58.488 --> 20:00.282
{\an1}that can help you
find your audience,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.659
{\an1}how are you not gonna
throw yourself at that?

20:02.743 --> 20:06.580
Well, what about the part
where things get...

20:06.663 --> 20:08.248
erased?

20:08.332 --> 20:09.541
{\an1}DAVID:
She's right, you know.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.627
{\an1}Art is the noblest
pursuit in the world, but...

20:11.710 --> 20:13.128
it's not paying the rent.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.672
(whispering): I'm sorry.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.649
COMIC: <i> But what I really like,</i>
<i>what I really like</i>

20:33.732 --> 20:37.152
is when people spell curse words
using asterisks.

20:37.235 --> 20:39.446
You've seen this? You know what
I'm talking about? It's like...

20:39.529 --> 20:42.574
I guess asterisks are kind of
like the chastity belt

20:42.658 --> 20:45.827
of the vowel world,
in the vowel community.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.163
I was looking for you.

20:48.246 --> 20:50.499
{\an3}Heard you were great
the last couple nights.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.293
{\an3}Congrats, kid,
you're headlining.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.671
Oh. Thank you.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.006
(laughing) Hey.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.343
Don't fuck it up. Huh?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.136
Who am I kidding?
Come on, it's you,

21:03.220 --> 21:05.847
of course you're
gonna fuck it up.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.141
{\an1}Hey, I'm just
messing with you.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.186
EMCEE:
...very funny guy, Samir Wassan!

21:11.269 --> 21:13.397
(cheering and applause)

21:15.774 --> 21:17.150
MAN:
All right!

21:17.234 --> 21:19.403
(people whooping)

21:21.279 --> 21:23.407
SAMIR:
Thank you.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.201
So a lot of people use
the Second Amendment

21:26.284 --> 21:29.830
as an excuse to say that guns
shouldn't be regulated,

21:29.913 --> 21:31.206
except that the Second Amendment

21:31.289 --> 21:34.001
actually starts
with the words, "A well

21:34.084 --> 21:36.336
regulated."

21:41.258 --> 21:43.218
I have a ten-year-old nephew,

21:43.301 --> 21:45.887
and the other day
he was making fun of my act.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.389
He's ten years old.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.684
{\an3}He's ten.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.227
Right.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.896
(quietly):
I don't have a nephew anymore.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.064
(woman clears throat)

21:56.148 --> 21:59.026
How about this president, huh?

21:59.109 --> 22:02.237
I don't want to say
he's a fascist dickhead

22:02.320 --> 22:05.866
{\an1}who should be hung by his nuts
in the public square,

22:05.949 --> 22:09.161
but only because I don't want
to talk to the Secret Service.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.626
{\an3}WOMAN:
Oh, man.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.389
Hey, uh, give it up for the guy
who was on stage

22:29.473 --> 22:31.767
{\an5}right before me.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.767
(light laughter)

22:31.850 --> 22:34.144
{\an5}MAN: Yeah!

22:31.850 --> 22:34.144
He's funny, right?

22:34.227 --> 22:37.314
He really crushed.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.275
{\an1}Didn't he?

22:37.397 --> 22:40.275
{\an3}(cheering)

22:40.358 --> 22:43.278
Not as badly as he crushed
a mom and her baby

22:43.361 --> 22:45.155
at the bus stop
across the street.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.074
(audience oohing)

22:47.157 --> 22:48.909
{\an1}I'm not joking!
He did that.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.410
(laughter)

22:50.494 --> 22:53.580
That mangled bus stop
across the street...

22:53.663 --> 22:54.623
{\an3}(applause)

22:54.706 --> 22:56.625
...that's his best work!
That's his biggest credit!

22:56.708 --> 22:58.251
(laughter)

22:58.335 --> 23:00.253
It was in the news.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.255
He got away with it, though.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.758
{\an1}And you saw his act,
you-you wouldn't think a guy

23:04.841 --> 23:07.094
with a hateful,
misogynistic act like that

23:07.177 --> 23:08.804
{\an1}would also be
a drunk driver.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.514
No, actually, that stands.

23:10.597 --> 23:11.723
That makes sense.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.643
Give it up for

23:14.726 --> 23:16.103
human piece of shit,

23:16.186 --> 23:17.646
Joe Donner.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.023
{\an5}(cheers and applause)

23:17.729 --> 23:20.023
(Joe laughing)

23:33.120 --> 23:35.872
'Cause he didn't smash into it,

23:35.956 --> 23:38.625
because he doesn't exist.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.670
{\an3}Hey, hey, you're the...
Hey, you totally killed tonight.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.006
Oh, thank you. You know,
I actually un-killed two people.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.800
{\an5}(laughs)

23:45.090 --> 23:46.800
This is you, right?

23:46.883 --> 23:48.343
{\an5}Yup.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.343
I am following you

23:48.426 --> 23:49.719
right now. (laughs)

23:49.803 --> 23:50.637
Oh, thank you so much.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.140
{\an5}Don't drink and drive, okay?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.140
All right.

23:53.223 --> 23:56.017
{\an1}Just like Joe Donner
didn't anymore.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.853
{\an5}Okay.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.853
You're so funny.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.147
{\an5}He is.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.147
I also saved two lives.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.732
One was a baby!

24:38.143 --> 24:41.021
in high school, he was a prick!

24:41.104 --> 24:43.023
Just a bad guy.

24:43.106 --> 24:45.525
{\an1}He was mean,
he was a bully.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.161
They grow, they learn.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.580
So I looked him up online.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.249
Now he works for
Doctors Without Borders.

25:01.333 --> 25:05.587
Oh, you horrible pieces of shit.

25:05.670 --> 25:09.758
I'm joking. Jamie Benson
murdered his fiancée.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.638
<i>He did!</i>

25:14.721 --> 25:16.348

25:51.383 --> 25:53.969
{\an3}O-Or what about
Coach Keller?

25:54.052 --> 25:56.638
Oh, yeah. That was crazy.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.683
I guess we just didn't know
how crazy it was at the time.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.476
{\an3}Uh, I knew.

26:01.559 --> 26:04.646
Man, there really are a lot
of loathsome psychopaths

26:04.729 --> 26:05.605
in the world, huh?

26:05.689 --> 26:08.024
Thank God you're not
a loathsome psychopath.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.652
That's the most romantic thing

26:21.496 --> 26:22.872
This is my favorite coat,

26:22.956 --> 26:25.959

Oh, mentor. Okay.
Yeah, why was I worried?

29:31.769 --> 29:34.856
I was talking to this

that he murdered someone.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.696
You know,
I guess it makes sense,

29:41.779 --> 29:43.156
'cause if I was a murderer,

29:43.239 --> 29:44.908
I would want to tell people,
too, you know?

29:44.991 --> 29:47.994
Pride in what you do
is important.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.372
Although, it seems like

29:51.456 --> 29:52.874
resisting the urge
to tell people

29:52.957 --> 29:57.295
might be an important life skill

30:01.257 --> 30:03.468
Buck. His name was Buck.

31:02.318 --> 31:04.487
And then <i> you</i> get in trouble.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.491
You get called
a jealous boyfriend

31:08.575 --> 31:11.452
for trying to save her
from getting MeToo'd

31:11.536 --> 31:13.746
by fucking David Kandel?

31:16.374 --> 31:19.085
(cheering and applause)

31:22.547 --> 31:23.506
Wow.

31:23.590 --> 31:27.051
{\an1}"Top Comedians
to Follow," huh?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.761
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.430
I forgot about that.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.349
Must be so exciting for you
to know someone on that list.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.517
You've been
strutting around here

31:34.601 --> 31:36.144
like the cock of the walk
lately.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.478
(chuckles)
Great metaphor.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.147
Hey, I'm a little busy
right now.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.441
Could you text my assistant,
'cause I want to talk.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.776
{\an3}Don't make me
hurt you, Samir.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.154
{\an3}(quietly):
Hey, baby.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.655
Hey.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.158
Hilarious as always, Samir.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.537
Hey, what would your,
uh, mentor David

31:54.621 --> 31:55.830
have thought of that set?

31:55.913 --> 31:58.124
What are you talking about?

31:58.207 --> 32:00.168
Wait, where are you going?

32:00.251 --> 32:03.087
I have to get to my shift.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.798
W-What shift?

32:06.716 --> 32:08.509
Rena, what's wrong?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.845
{\an1}I'm late.
You gonna get me fired?

32:10.928 --> 32:12.138
Okay.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.057
{\an3}Why would they have
you come in now?

32:14.140 --> 32:15.683
And they're not gonna fire
their best lawyer

32:15.767 --> 32:16.851
for being slightly late.

32:16.934 --> 32:19.854
Lawyer? Are you kidding me?

32:19.937 --> 32:22.357
Wait, wait, wait, you're,
you're not a lawyer?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.150
Screw you.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.030
David Kandel.

32:29.113 --> 32:32.283
She doesn't have a career
without fucking David Kandel.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.171
Rena, I screwed something up.

32:45.254 --> 32:48.049
You have screwed many things up,
Samir, but I am late right now.

32:48.132 --> 32:48.883
{\an3}I'm sorry.

32:48.966 --> 32:50.927
{\an1}No, no, listen.
I changed something.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.971
{\an5}Okay? You were supposed to...

32:51.010 --> 32:53.971
Supposed to what?

32:54.055 --> 32:56.891
{\an3}Keep waiting patiently for you
to get your career together?

32:56.974 --> 32:57.892
No.

32:57.975 --> 32:59.352
{\an1}Wait,
where's your red coat?

32:59.435 --> 33:00.561
{\an1}The one we got
in Paris?

33:00.645 --> 33:01.854
{\an5}What are you talking about?

33:00.645 --> 33:01.854
{\an1}Paris.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.107
When we went to Paris. The...

33:05.983 --> 33:08.903
We never went to Paris
'cause we couldn't afford it.

33:08.986 --> 33:10.905
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.573
{\an5}Hey, hey, hey.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.573
I swear to God,

33:12.657 --> 33:14.409
if you touch me one more time...

33:14.492 --> 33:16.119
{\an5}You okay, honey?

33:14.492 --> 33:16.119
{\an1}I'm fine.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.745
She's fine.
It's okay, it's okay.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.288
Okay, hey, hey,
that was the trip

33:19.372 --> 33:20.289
that saved our relationship.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.375
{\an6}But we didn't
go on it...

33:20.373 --> 33:22.375
Saved our...?

33:22.458 --> 33:23.751
Listen, we couldn't go because
you couldn't afford it,

33:23.835 --> 33:25.169
but now I can afford it, so...

33:25.253 --> 33:26.713
You're a dick, Samir.

33:26.796 --> 33:27.755
Okay, you don't understand...

33:27.839 --> 33:28.923
No, you don't understand.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.383
{\an1}You don't think about
how your actions

33:30.466 --> 33:31.884
{\an1}affect me
or anybody else.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.720
We're all just
background to you.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.514
{\an5}Material.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.514
COOK: Table 12.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.478
Hey.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.771
I'm sorry. I'm sorr-- hey.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.273
Remember when you gave me
that advice,

33:45.356 --> 33:47.108
{\an3}when you told me that I
could be strong on stage?

33:47.191 --> 33:49.026
That I could play
to my strengths?

33:49.110 --> 33:51.612
You said that I need
to let go of stuff?

33:51.696 --> 33:53.740
{\an3}So I did that. I did
that for us. I did that,

33:53.823 --> 33:55.116
I did that for you.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.285
You said it was
okay to punch.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.287
{\an1}When am I gonna
be the joke?

33:59.370 --> 34:02.123
This argument, when's that
gonna show up in your act?

34:02.206 --> 34:03.458
We're done, Samir.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.460
No, no, no. No, no, no.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.462
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.964
I have this power, okay?

34:10.047 --> 34:11.799
{\an5}I have this superpower.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.799
(stifled laugh)

34:11.882 --> 34:14.135
I do. The reason you're doing
this right now...

34:14.217 --> 34:15.969
The reason I'm doing this
right now, Samir,

34:16.053 --> 34:19.306
is that you are
a selfish asshole.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.904
♪ ♪

34:46.583 --> 34:48.753
♪ ♪

35:17.448 --> 35:19.367
(yells)

35:42.265 --> 35:45.810
{\an5}(cheering and applause)

35:42.265 --> 35:45.810
Thank you.

35:45.893 --> 35:49.021
What do you think it's like
to have a penis?

35:49.105 --> 35:50.565
Obviously...

35:53.651 --> 35:56.320
That cute little Indian girl
dumped you, huh?

35:56.404 --> 35:59.198
{\an1}Shit, man, that sucks.
I'm sorry.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.118
{\an1}For you, I'm sorry for you.
'Cause that was just

36:02.201 --> 36:05.288
clearly the right decision
for her, you know?

36:05.371 --> 36:08.457
She's all I know, I...

36:08.541 --> 36:10.710
I don't know what I am
without her.

36:10.793 --> 36:12.211
(applause in distance)

36:12.295 --> 36:14.130
{\an3}My...

36:14.213 --> 36:16.340
career's finally taking off.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.301
Can't win at everything, right?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.761
People think I'm funny.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.763
You know how hard
it's been for me,

36:22.847 --> 36:24.932
people not thinking I was funny?

36:25.016 --> 36:27.476
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.811
I hear you.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.772
Maybe this is how it goes.

36:31.856 --> 36:35.985
You get something,
you got to give something up.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.619
{\an1}Samir,

36:44.702 --> 36:48.623
if you go on a murder rampage,

36:48.706 --> 36:50.791
can you try not to do it
while I'm here, please?

36:50.875 --> 36:54.295
And just to be clear,
I say that not because

36:54.378 --> 36:57.131
{\an1}you're brown,
I say it because

36:57.214 --> 36:59.508
"you're a man," sort of.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.801
PETE:
There's my two little stars.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.304
There's our weird, creepy uncle.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.347
(laughs)

37:04.430 --> 37:05.848
{\an1}(chuckles)
Weird, creepy laugh.

37:05.932 --> 37:06.641
So,

37:06.724 --> 37:09.393
{\an1}Candy Gower
from <i> The Gower Hour</i>

37:09.477 --> 37:10.686
{\an1}is coming
to the late set tonight.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.022
{\an4}Okay.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.022
And she is here for you two.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.607
Two?

37:14.690 --> 37:16.067
{\an6}PETE:
You didn't hear
this from me,

37:16.150 --> 37:17.860
but <i> The Gower Hour</i> needs
a new cast member,

37:17.944 --> 37:20.529
and it's pretty much narrowed
down to two up-and-coming comics

37:20.613 --> 37:23.032
you may have heard of
named you and you.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.700
Doesn't know our names.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.286
{\an4}EMCEE:
Please welcome
Samir Wassan.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.329
He's Samir Wassan.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.248
Ah. He just said it. So...

37:32.875 --> 37:34.669
(cheering and applause)

37:45.262 --> 37:47.682
SAMIR:
The Second Amendment says...

37:47.765 --> 37:52.728
uh, "A well regulated..."

37:58.484 --> 38:02.196
My football coach was a rapist.

38:04.949 --> 38:08.035
{\an3}WOMAN:
What did he just say?

38:08.119 --> 38:09.704
Right.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.956
You need fresh blood.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.874
GABE:
What we need is jokes.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.585
Who said that?
Who fucking said that?

38:16.669 --> 38:19.755
It was me.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.757
So you think you're funny?

38:22.633 --> 38:25.928
No, we just think you're not.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.347
(laughter)

38:28.431 --> 38:30.766
MAN:
Ooh...

38:30.850 --> 38:33.394
(cheering and applause)

38:33.477 --> 38:37.106
Okay. Okay.

38:37.189 --> 38:40.234
What's your name?

38:40.317 --> 38:42.737
What's everybody's name?

38:46.615 --> 38:48.075
Gabe.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.910
Will.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.456
Uh-huh. And where
do you guys work?

38:53.539 --> 38:56.000
{\an1}Uh, we work
at Wellspring Capital.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.085
So you're, what, like,
hedge fund guys?

38:58.169 --> 38:59.962
{\an3}WILL:
Yeah, actually,

39:00.046 --> 39:02.548
we invest in hedge funds.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.091
Wow.
(laughs)

39:04.175 --> 39:06.927
GABE:
Yeah. Wow is right, bro.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.929
We're talking about--

39:09.013 --> 39:13.225
{\an1}count 'em--
mm... nine figures.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.894
Nine figures!

39:14.977 --> 39:17.563
{\an1}I-I got to give it to you,
that actually is impressive.

39:17.646 --> 39:21.484
You know, I love guys like this.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.319
(laughter)

39:23.402 --> 39:25.696
(cheering and applause)

39:30.242 --> 39:32.953
They get off work
after a long day

39:33.037 --> 39:36.957
of investing in hedge funds--
did I get that right?

39:37.041 --> 39:40.002
Want to make sure I get
the details right here.

39:40.086 --> 39:43.172
These guys are like, "Oh,
we're gonna go to a comedy club,

39:43.255 --> 39:45.216
"we're gonna heckle
the comedian.

39:46.133 --> 39:49.970
And tell everyone
how much money we make."

39:52.098 --> 39:55.684
Gabe and Will,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.479
Gabe and Will.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.274
(cheering and applause)

40:05.736 --> 40:07.154
{\an3}(whooping)

40:21.919 --> 40:23.504
{\an3}(exhales)

40:23.587 --> 40:24.672
It's you and me, huh?

40:24.755 --> 40:25.673
Not now.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.216
Oh, yeah. Now.

40:29.426 --> 40:31.428
It's one spot.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.014
{\an3}One spot.
(chuckles)

40:34.098 --> 40:37.393
On <i> The Gower Hour.</i>

40:37.476 --> 40:39.186
{\an3}(scatting)

40:39.270 --> 40:41.355
{\an3}(laughs)

40:41.438 --> 40:45.067
That shit should have
gone straight to me.

40:45.151 --> 40:49.196
I have been the MVP up
in here for a minute.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.573
But somehow,

40:50.656 --> 40:51.907
{\an3}suddenly,

40:51.991 --> 40:53.868
you get funny.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.911
How does that
happen, huh?

40:55.995 --> 40:58.080
{\an3}How the hell you
pull that off?

40:58.164 --> 40:59.874
{\an1}Didi, we really don't
have to do this

40:59.957 --> 41:01.083
{\an1}right now.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.083
{\an3}What?

41:01.167 --> 41:03.252
{\an4}I'm not gonna
go on stage tonight.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.252
{\an3}What?

41:03.335 --> 41:04.753
{\an6}What are you
talking about?

41:03.335 --> 41:04.753
I don't want it.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.089
{\an5}You can have it.
I don't want it.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.089
No. No, that is some--

41:07.173 --> 41:09.049
{\an5}I-I'm not...

41:07.173 --> 41:09.049
No, fuck you. No.

41:09.133 --> 41:13.053
No, I am not about to
let you do that shit.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.763
{\an1}Why not?

41:14.847 --> 41:16.056
'Cause you're good.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.766
{\an3}You've been
fucking killing it.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.561
{\an3}And I'm honestly
kind of embarrassed

41:20.644 --> 41:23.522
{\an3}that I didn't see how funny
you were from the start.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.399
But you can't stop now.

41:25.482 --> 41:27.610
{\an3}So, I came in here
to tell you that if,

41:27.693 --> 41:29.820
{\an3}that if Candy
Gower chooses you,

41:29.904 --> 41:31.155
{\an3}well, then I
would be happy.

41:31.238 --> 41:32.990
{\an3}'Cause it would
be a good choice.

41:33.073 --> 41:36.535
{\an5}WOMAN (over P.A.): Didi to the
stage. Didi to the stage.

41:33.073 --> 41:36.535
{\an3}Oh.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.580
{\an1}So no more
of this bullshit about

41:39.663 --> 41:41.957
"Oh, I'm not
gonna go up,"

41:42.041 --> 41:44.293
{\an1}and "Oh, my goodness,
I have a vagina

41:44.376 --> 41:46.587
{\an1}"and it's hurting
and I'm on my period

41:46.670 --> 41:48.088
and I can't find tampons"

41:48.172 --> 41:50.466
or whatever the fuck
you're talking about.

41:50.549 --> 41:51.967
{\an1}Okay?

41:52.051 --> 41:53.594
I'll see you...

41:53.677 --> 41:54.970
{\an1}on stage.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.806
{\an1}(sniffs) And may
the baddest bitch win.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.935
