08:56.840 --> 09:00.410
kayakers are missing done with

08:58.549 --> 09:02.779
experience along this coast or in these

09:00.409 --> 09:03.799
waters now there are three options one

09:02.779 --> 09:05.269
they're dead

09:03.799 --> 09:08.329
you can forget that right now they're

09:05.269 --> 09:09.980
alive to there in the water

09:08.330 --> 09:12.110
postcards got that covered if they're in

09:09.980 --> 09:14.600
the water postcard will find them and

09:12.110 --> 09:16.190
three and most likely they've been swept

09:14.600 --> 09:17.840
into one of these caves along the base

09:16.190 --> 09:20.570
of the cliffs that's what we're gonna

09:17.840 --> 09:23.210
look gonna leapfrog along the pollies we

09:20.570 --> 09:25.550
searched every single one of them

09:23.210 --> 09:28.400
this camera has a built-in infrared

09:25.549 --> 09:30.949
sensor you can literally see into the

09:28.399 --> 09:33.079
dark its new technology but we won't

09:30.950 --> 09:36.680
know what you have until we play it back

09:33.080 --> 09:39.680
word of caution these caves are

09:36.679 --> 09:41.029
dangerous and unforgiving surges are

09:39.679 --> 09:42.379
unpredictable why you're looking for

09:41.029 --> 09:44.089
your victims you can get hammered

09:42.379 --> 09:45.559
headroom changes

09:44.090 --> 09:47.750
one minute you're in a room at the

09:45.559 --> 09:51.529
12-foot ceilings the next minute you're

09:47.750 --> 09:53.389
squashed reefs all along the bottom

09:51.529 --> 09:57.079
some have false bottoms that lead into

09:53.389 --> 09:58.819
other chambers lava tubes if I didn't

09:57.080 --> 10:01.580
think these kids were in one of these

09:58.820 --> 10:03.530
caves I would never send you in there

10:01.580 --> 10:07.400

10:07.399 --> 10:18.559
careful

10:08.690 --> 10:20.120
save the victims don't become

10:18.559 --> 10:23.028
they wonder why this is Coast Guard

37:53.639 --> 37:56.489
together the money put up with all that

37:55.079 --> 37:59.579
bureaucracy you know he was offered a

37:56.489 --> 38:00.929
chief spot in Los Angeles yeah the

37:59.579 --> 38:05.279
pressures been happy for him to get back

38:00.929 --> 38:06.269
it's been tough on him tough on her than

38:05.280 --> 38:09.210
I thought it would be

38:06.269 --> 38:11.610
we could use a little break huh gonna

38:09.210 --> 38:13.019
have to schedule some of that in well I

38:11.610 --> 38:17.070
think I have a solution

38:13.019 --> 38:20.400
do you so the father of the kids we

38:17.070 --> 38:23.309
saved is a very successful man he

38:20.400 --> 38:25.590
realized that not only as well couldn't

38:23.309 --> 38:27.000
help save his children incredible one of

38:25.590 --> 38:30.059
life's on the line it makes everything

38:27.000 --> 38:31.559
else you so meaningless when he found

38:30.059 --> 38:34.019
out i was a volunteer the thought of us

38:31.559 --> 38:36.269
risking a large favor we didn't even

38:34.019 --> 38:37.500
know it amazed him he actually broke

38:36.269 --> 38:40.440
down and cried

38:37.500 --> 38:44.280
really it's nice to be appreciated

38:40.440 --> 38:48.090
that's for sure he wants to express his

38:44.280 --> 38:49.980
gratitude in a more tangible way he

38:48.090 --> 38:51.120
wants us to spend the weekend here all

38:49.980 --> 38:54.420
expenses paid

38:51.119 --> 38:57.239
well that's very generous but it

38:54.420 --> 38:58.440
wouldn't be appropriate right we talk

38:57.239 --> 39:05.219
about it

38:58.440 --> 39:07.139
this island hot look after weather

39:05.219 --> 39:09.088

39:07.139 --> 39:10.588
volunteered he wants to do

39:09.088 --> 39:13.440
alli is completely out of the question I

39:10.588 --> 39:18.119
won't even consider it

39:13.440 --> 39:21.510
it wouldn't be right and stick it where

39:18.119 --> 39:23.099
ya father the kids we rescued want us to

39:21.510 --> 39:26.970

39:26.969 --> 39:30.299
wait a minute way to me at least talk

39:29.068 --> 39:33.088

this is his way of saying thank you ok

39:33.088 --> 39:36.449
handshake is enough

39:34.530 --> 39:39.180
what we did was supposed to do that's

39:36.449 --> 39:41.279
all well that's all this is a handshake

39:44.429 --> 39:48.868
yes by not letting this man express his

39:46.289 --> 39:50.219
