WEBVTT

00:17.434 --> 00:20.347
- You okay? Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.184
- Is it them, Daddy?
- Stay put.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.353
Here.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.112
Stay right here. I'll be back.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.260
Right on, sister. Power to the people.

01:38.348 --> 01:42.638
- What was he doing here?
- Smokey? Just a visit. Bless his heart.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.723
- He was worried about me.
- Should he be?

01:44.896 --> 01:47.229
- No.
- Yes. The gunshot is not the issue.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.608
- What concerns me is the concussion.
- You have a concussion?

01:50.777 --> 01:54.236
So it seems. Dembe and I were
in a minor car accident.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.274
You suffered
a significant blow to the head.

01:57.451 --> 02:02.037
Any brain bleed appears to be under
control as of now, but that could change.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.071
You're on bed rest. No argument.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.583
If the headaches get worse
or you experience slurred speech...

02:07.753 --> 02:09.494
This is wildly inconvenient.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.084
So is dropping dead from a hemorrhage.

02:12.257 --> 02:16.968
I'll have a trauma team on standby.
I don't want him leaving this apartment.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.380
- So how does it feel?
- How does what feel?

02:20.557 --> 02:23.300
To know the man responsible
for killing Tom is dead.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.434
Tom died so I could know the truth.

02:25.604 --> 02:28.392
The secret inside that bag,
that's still out there.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.647
Garvey must have hidden it.

02:30.817 --> 02:35.278
Now that he's gone, we have to accept
the fact that it may never be found.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.406
I'm guessing you have no idea
where to find it.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.112
It was Jennifer, wasn't it?

02:42.329 --> 02:45.447
How you knew that Garvey would
betray our agreement...

02:45.624 --> 02:49.243
- ...and try to kill me at the meet.
- Yes.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.245
You knew where she was
and didn't tell me.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.291
She's spent her life hiding from you.
I should honor her request.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.088
I agree.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.680
Good. So you accept
that she doesn't wanna see you?

03:02.849 --> 03:05.717
- I do.
- So you won't go and see her?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.599
You heard the good doctor.

03:08.772 --> 03:12.140
It appears I'm not supposed
to go anywhere.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.685
Red is gonna try and get to this girl.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.445
- Thought he was on bed rest.
- He is, which gives us a head start...

03:18.615 --> 03:21.528
...on finding out how she's connected
to Garvey and the bag.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.696
A girl with leukemia walking alone
on the edge of New Hampshire?

03:25.872 --> 03:29.081
No name, no parents,
no fingerprints or ID on file.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.584
They think she walked out of the woods.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.042
What makes you think the article has
any connection to the bag?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.798
Red was reading it. He tried to hide it.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.177
- Not very well, apparently.
- This girl is important.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.714
This story has the hallmarks
of a case on the Blacklist.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.884
A girl appears out of nowhere,
untouched by modern medicine.

03:48.061 --> 03:52.476
No evidence of vaccinations, zero trace
of the toxins we encounter daily.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.063
The only thing that Reddington
cares about is that bag.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.650
Would he stop his search
to read some random article...

03:59.823 --> 04:03.282
...about a girl with cancer
who walks out of the woods?

04:03.452 --> 04:05.865
Pay the girl a visit.
See what we're dealing with.

04:06.037 --> 04:09.121
Whatever Red's hiding,
it's time the truth came out.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.582
You shouldn't be here.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.415
I'm fine.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.171
Dr. Lomay has always been
a nervous Nellie.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.798
I'm not talking about Dr. Lomay.
You told Elizabeth...

04:20.969 --> 04:25.259
I told Elizabeth I understood
why Jennifer wouldn't want to see me.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.890
I never said I wouldn't try to see her.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.604
What?

04:38.945 --> 04:41.028
Ian Garvey.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.818
I know he meant a great deal to you.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.531
The answer's no.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.743
And I'm sorry for your loss.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.662
I know why you're here.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.953
It's to see if he gave me a duffel bag,
and he didn't.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.501
Yes, I believe you.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.507
You should.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.215
I don't care about your bag,
and I don't care about you.

05:05.388 --> 05:09.632
If Garvey didn't give it to you,
it's possible he gave it to your mother.

05:10.143 --> 05:14.513
- You're never gonna find her.
- Which means you know where she is.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.766
After you abandoned us,
we lost everything.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.526
Mom lost everything.

05:20.695 --> 05:25.235
Her house, her friends,
her entire history.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.904
Everything but her decency.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.695
That, you cannot take from her.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.623
I need to find Naomi.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.703
Maybe. But you never will.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.303
When she was brought in,
she was violent. We had to sedate her.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.715
She tries to refuse treatment,
doesn't want anyone touching her.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.259
- What's that on the floor?
- It was in her backpack.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.554
Some mineral concoction.
Lab says it's harmless.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.849
Psych team says she believes
it has protective powers.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.813
- From what?
- Mind if I go in?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.694
Be my guest.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.691
It's okay.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.201
I'm a friend.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.114
Did someone hurt you?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.872
Your parents, are they okay?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.373
They took my dad.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.088
Who took him? What happened?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.884
No! Don't! You're infected!
Stay away from me.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.344
No, no! No.

06:33.518 --> 06:37.102
"It seemed to him that he had gone
a terribly long distance...

06:37.272 --> 06:41.437
...when something tickled his nose.
That wonderful nose could smell..."

06:41.610 --> 06:45.194
The scout team from north,
they've signaled. They found one.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.400
They're bringing him in now.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.658
Secure the perimeter.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.443
Sound the distress signal.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.368
Notify the men
we're bringing in an afflicted.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.543
No, please.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.387
No. Please.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.269
- Where's the girl?
- Couldn't find her.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.855
We think the Ollo may have taken her.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.532
He's infected. Won't last the night.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.238
Prepare the inglenook!

07:45.882 --> 07:48.920
<i>Okay, I have a lead.
There was another one found.</i>

07:49.094 --> 07:51.507
Forty-six miles from our Jane Doe.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.889
- You have our attention.
- 2003, maintenance workers...

07:55.058 --> 07:59.473
...from RBX Rail discovered
a deranged man in a remote section...

07:59.646 --> 08:03.640
<i>...in Grafton County. The man claimed
his name was W.P. Frost and was lost.</i>

08:03.817 --> 08:07.106
Law enforcement couldn't confirm
his identity, find any family...

08:07.278 --> 08:10.442
- ...or the community that he left.
- He appeared out of thin air.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.824
- Like our girl.
<i>- He had no modern dental work.</i>

08:13.994 --> 08:17.328
His blood work exhibited
the same rare biological pathogens.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.864
Is Frost alive? Can you put us in touch?

08:20.041 --> 08:23.000
Between '05 and '08,
he was a ward of the state...

08:23.169 --> 08:26.287
...committed to the Heinritz
Psychiatric Center in Concord.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.081
<i>He was under the care
of a Dr. Francis Woerner...</i>

08:29.259 --> 08:32.501
...who is an expert
in anomalistic psychology...

08:32.679 --> 08:35.842
...which is "the study of extraordinary
behavior and experience...

08:36.015 --> 08:39.554
...including those which are
often labeled paranormal."

08:40.227 --> 08:42.936
Dr. Woerner, thank you for meeting us.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.690
Of course. I'm curious about the child,
the one you found.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.567
- You seen her file?
- I have.

08:48.737 --> 08:54.324
I'm curious about what wasn't in the file.
Did she tell you about a contagion?

08:54.492 --> 08:56.404
Anything from Stav?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.194
Not in the last 10 minutes.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.364
He's on her person and her phone?

09:01.541 --> 09:05.911
Yes, and checking in more often than
my mother. Before the cancer got her.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.330
If Jennifer visits Naomi or calls her,
we'll know.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.591
Garvey must have had
a death switch in place...

09:12.761 --> 09:14.878
...a way to get one of them the bag.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.924
- We just need to find out what that is.
- Smokey needs to find out.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.138
You need to rest and take your antibiotic.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.896
Smokey will find out as soon
as he's finished adjusting his collar.

09:26.066 --> 09:31.437
No, Smokey won't because Smokey's
a genius who already found it out.

09:31.613 --> 09:35.653
Or found the guy who can tell us
what it is. Garvey's number two.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.612
- Judson.
- As we speak...

09:37.786 --> 09:42.281
...he's clenching his keister at the Holt
Federal Detention, an hour from here.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.370
- Can we trust him?
- Pardon my French but:

09:47.253 --> 09:50.542
As Alexander Fleming should have said,
but never did:

09:50.715 --> 09:53.628
"Good intel is the best antibiotic."

09:53.802 --> 09:58.012
When I met Frost, it was as if he'd come
from another time.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.015
His knowledge of history,
science, pop culture...

10:01.184 --> 10:03.801
...they all ceased in 1957.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.312
As if they'd been erased
or simply never happened at all.

10:07.482 --> 10:11.522
How did he explain the present?
Your computer, modern vehicles...

10:12.195 --> 10:15.529
- The contagion.
- I don't know what that is.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.941
Frost was a paranoid man,
haunted by delusions.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.701
Early on, we believed...

10:20.870 --> 10:23.487
...he might be enduring
hypnagogic hallucinations.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.579
In the end, there was no explanation
other than what Frost believed...

10:27.752 --> 10:29.163
...to be real was real.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.580
That he'd somehow survived
a cataclysmic event...

10:32.757 --> 10:35.465
...he called The Age of Contagion.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.173
- Found it.
- Perhaps it would be best...

10:39.347 --> 10:42.055
...if you heard it from Frost himself.

10:42.225 --> 10:46.185
<i>- Tell me again when it happened.
- June 24, 1957.</i>

10:46.354 --> 10:49.688
<i>What happened on that day?
How did it get out of control?</i>

10:49.858 --> 10:54.774
<i>Carl Davies. He was a tech
at a medical-research lab called Cyntax.</i>

10:54.946 --> 10:59.156
<i>Suffered an accidental needle stick.
Within six hours, they'd lost containment.</i>

10:59.325 --> 11:02.818
<i>England was infected the next night.
America, three days later.</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:05.613
<i>- But you, you got out.
- Not me.</i>

11:05.790 --> 11:07.247
<i>The elders.</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:09.500
<i>They made it into the woods.</i>

11:09.669 --> 11:13.037
<i>Only survived because there was
a wretched freeze, killed most of them.</i>

11:13.214 --> 11:14.705
<i>A few uninfected survived.</i>

11:14.883 --> 11:19.002
<i>Those survivors who went on to found
New Haven. They remain isolated?</i>

11:19.179 --> 11:22.172
<i>Free from infection by the...
What do you call them?</i>

11:23.099 --> 11:24.431
<i>The Ollo.</i>

11:24.601 --> 11:27.890
<i>Remind me, who are the Ollo?</i>

11:28.062 --> 11:29.519
<i>The others.</i>

11:29.689 --> 11:31.305
<i>Like you.</i>

11:31.482 --> 11:33.690
<i>The ones who carry the strain.</i>

11:33.860 --> 11:36.102
<i>That's why we guard New Haven,
keep it pure.</i>

11:36.279 --> 11:38.987
<i>What happens if someone
wanders away or gets infected?</i>

11:39.157 --> 11:43.026
<i>Gotta get purified. Set clean.
Taken to the inglenook.</i>

11:54.297 --> 11:56.880
No, no, no.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.175
No!

12:17.028 --> 12:19.065
No, please!

12:22.075 --> 12:24.692
I can't imagine how you must you feel.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.657
- But remember, he strayed.
- No!

12:27.872 --> 12:31.240
- No!
- He got himself infected.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.458
He did this to your family.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.121
What about my Maybelle?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.039
We're searching.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.298
But remember what has
to happen if we find her.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.148
Frost was convinced
that the Ollo would come for him.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.438
If he were found, he would have
to be purified by the inglenook.

13:02.615 --> 13:06.279
His only protection was a dust
he called rhyolite.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.162
No spirits could cross it.
He left circles on the floor of it.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.323
We'd like to speak with Frost.

13:12.834 --> 13:17.499
We got a call one night from Security.
Window was broken, sign of a struggle.

13:17.672 --> 13:21.507
- So he escaped?
- Either that, or Frost was right.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.259
And the Ollo came for him.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.395
You all right?

13:35.565 --> 13:39.275
My car. It was parked right here.
You see what happened to it?

13:39.444 --> 13:40.810
"See"?

13:40.987 --> 13:45.652
'66 Mustang? Burnt-orange metallic?
White racing stripes?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.818
Ronnie, I couldn't take
my eyes off it. Stunning.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.157
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.869
I know quite a bit about you,
Officer Glanton.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.455
My first thought was to kidnap your wife.

13:56.627 --> 14:00.792
Word on the street is, you may love
that vehicle more than the wife.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.590
- I'm calling the police.
- That won't be necessary.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.585
I just need a small favor.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.297
What kind of favor?

14:09.474 --> 14:12.842
There's an inmate
on the cellblock you supervise.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.762
His name is Judson.
I need to have a word with him.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.305
Judson? This is about Judson?

14:18.483 --> 14:22.102
Help me make contact
and we'll return the car unharmed.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.440
I took the liberty of calling you a cab.
Think about it.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.542
I brought you something.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.751
Rhyolite.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.302
To keep the Ollo away.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.300
What's your name?

14:54.477 --> 14:56.264
Maybelle.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.019
That's a pretty name.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.347
My name's Elizabeth.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.562
Are you from New Haven?

15:02.735 --> 15:06.354
- How did you...?
- I know a lot of things, Maybelle.

15:06.531 --> 15:10.150
I know about Davies,
Cambridge, the infection.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.615
I know about the Ollo,
but I'm not one of them.

15:13.788 --> 15:16.371
Can you take me to New Haven?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.533
Keep me safe?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.709
Are there others like us?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.921
The Ollo came for us
when we tried to leave.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.215
I got away.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.751
They took my dad.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.795
Why did you try to leave?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.889
I'm sick.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.844
My dad said he heard about people
who could help me.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.479
Your daddy's a very smart man.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.317
- What did they do to him?
- That's for Mr. Moore to decide.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.399
Mr. Moore.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.910
I'd like to meet him.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.909
Can you take me to Mr. Moore?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.915
- Excuse me.
- It'll have to wait.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.169
- Sorry. They need her downstairs.
- I can call her doctor.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.081
Her doctor's the one
that wants her in Microbiology.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.760
Evidently, she's needed downstairs.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.260
- Don't let him take me. I don't want to go.
- We're gonna figure this out.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.396
- Is this really necessary?
- The child is ill.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.557
And a victim.
We need to find her family.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.602
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm here for the patient.

16:27.778 --> 16:28.939
Jane Doe in 314.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.824
- That patient was picked up.
- I'll take the service entrance.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.737
I got the front. Notify security.
Tell them our Jane Doe's been abducted.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.090
Put your hands up.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.285
Gone? What do you mean, she's gone?

17:26.462 --> 17:29.455
Overcome. Taken. She's vanished.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.340
I've run hospital feeds, CCTV.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.003
- What about the van?
- No plates, no clean shot of the VIN.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.548
- Laundry service and number are fakes.
- And her cell?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.092
Found a quarter mile from the hospital.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.852
It's gonna be okay, Aram.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.354
I pulled one image of the abductor.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.688
But I can't find any matches
in the system.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.318
- Send it wide.
<i>- Can't believe this is happening.</i>

17:52.488 --> 17:54.275
Everything is gonna be okay.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.906
Stop saying that, Liz.
Everything won't be okay.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.159
Samar was taken by a professional.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.945
We don't have a single lead
on how to find her.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.785
I think I got something.

18:03.958 --> 18:08.498
Keen said our Jane Doe mentioned
a name before she was taken.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.958
- Yeah. Moore.
<i>- Ran that through our database.</i>

18:11.132 --> 18:14.421
Get this. The bureau has an open file
on a missing male.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.258
Nicholas Tyler Moore, 30 years old
when he vanished back in 1973.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.175
- He's connected because...?
- He vanished from Grafton County.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.967
Where our Jane Doe was found.

18:24.145 --> 18:27.388
And where W.P. Frost was found
wandering the tracks.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.148
- Any friends, family?
- A widow in Tamworth.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.434
Go. Now.

18:32.028 --> 18:35.112
One day, he just takes off.
Don't show up to work.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.115
Don't come to church.
Nobody's seen him since.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.868
He didn't leave a letter?
Ever try to call? No explanation at all?

18:42.038 --> 18:44.951
Nicholas and I didn't have
a healthy relationship.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.617
We found a girl we think may have seen
your missing husband.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.253
- No, that ain't right.
- Ms. Moore...

18:51.422 --> 18:54.005
...have you ever heard of Carl Davies?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.508
What does that got to do with anything?

18:56.677 --> 18:58.839
- So you have.
- Of course I have.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.347
- He's the whole reason for New Haven.
- Where is that?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.304
What is this really about?

19:05.478 --> 19:09.017
The girl we found, she may be
from a place called New Haven.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.022
Is that a fact?

19:11.817 --> 19:14.230
Afraid of the Ollo?
Think they're coming to get her?

19:14.403 --> 19:17.612
- Use rhyolite for protection?
- How do you know this?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.616
The girl ain't seen my husband.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.248
She just read his book.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.504
Officer Glanton, welcome aboard.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.095
I deliver the earpiece
and our business is finished.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.805
- That's the agreement.
- You'll hold up your end?

19:47.978 --> 19:49.935
<i>Look to your left, Ronnie.</i>

19:55.486 --> 19:57.899
You'll find the car here when we're done.

19:58.072 --> 20:02.942
The keys and a bonus prize for playing
will be under the left rear floor mat.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.207
Pick it up.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.096
Here you go. Sir.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.223
- What?
- Shut up. Take it.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.059
Don't look at it.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.890
It's an earpiece.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.393
<i>Mr. Judson,
good to see you up and about.</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:42.485
I thought you might've suffered
the same fate as your employer.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.446
- Reddington?
- We have unfinished business.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.862
- You have something that belongs to me.
<i>- The duffel bag?</i>

20:49.039 --> 20:51.372
I don't have it. I don't know who does.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.078
Careful, Mr. Judson.

20:53.252 --> 20:58.043
You're at a crossroads. What you say
next could determine the rest of your life.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.587
Look, Garvey knew you were closing in.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.378
<i>A few weeks before he died,
I took him to the airport.</i>

21:04.555 --> 21:06.763
He had the bag with him when he went.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.265
When I picked him up after,
it was gone.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.930
Where did he go?

21:16.484 --> 21:17.691
Costa Rica.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.985
<i>You want the duffel, that's where it is.</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:25.990
She's here.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.448
Delivered as promised.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.907
- Who's she?
- Don't you worry about her.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.041
Yeah? Why not?

21:35.211 --> 21:38.204
You contracted for the girl.
You got the girl.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.964
I'll take care of this one.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.838
Edward has fueled the jet.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.883
If you insist,
we can leave within the hour.

21:52.102 --> 21:56.346
You're a good friend who takes
better care of me than I deserve.

21:56.941 --> 22:02.153
The pilot on Garvey's jet says a town car
was waiting for him on the tarmac.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.735
Company dispatch gave me
the address where he was taken.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.945
- Why would they tell you that?
- They didn't.

22:08.118 --> 22:13.238
They told Detective Rodrigo Vallejo
<i>del Organismo de InvestigaciÃ³n Judicial.</i>

22:13.415 --> 22:15.532
My last fiancÃ©e taught me <i>EspaÃ±ol.</i>

22:16.627 --> 22:18.835
Raymond, it's her.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.458
- Hello.
- I can take you to Naomi.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.967
- What changed?
<i>- I have questions I need you to answer.</i>

22:29.139 --> 22:31.552
I don't think you'll be honest
unless motivated.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.138
A car will pick you up in half an hour.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.429
I... I thought we were wheels up ASAP.

22:37.606 --> 22:41.816
You still are. Track down that address.
Call me when you have.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.895
Wait.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.689
- I'm going without you?
- Best-case scenario:

22:47.867 --> 22:51.827
Costa Rica tells us where the bag
has been and where it's going.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.660
Finding Naomi Hyland may tell us
where the bag is.

22:55.833 --> 23:00.328
Dembe, inform Edward
there's been a change of plan.

23:05.676 --> 23:10.888
<i>The Age of Contagion</i> is a paperback
written by Nicholas T. Moore in 1971.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.140
A group survives a plague
that nearly wipes out civilization.

23:14.310 --> 23:18.179
They retreat to the forest to hide
from the infected, or the Ollo.

23:18.355 --> 23:22.474
Everything we've learned from the girl,
W.P. Frost, it's all in this book?

23:22.651 --> 23:24.938
New Haven, rhyolite,
warnings about leaving camp.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.776
You think Frost wandered and stumbled
upon modern civilization?

23:28.949 --> 23:30.531
The sick girl? Her father?

23:30.701 --> 23:34.570
They went in search of modern medicine
for her, only to have him dragged back.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.581
- Like Frost.
- If these people are isolationists...

23:37.750 --> 23:41.209
...like the characters in the book,
then they think that we are infected.

23:41.378 --> 23:45.042
According to the book, once infected,
the only way you can be purified...

23:45.215 --> 23:48.128
...is by burning
in some giant furnace-like fire.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.669
- Which is what they'll do.
- The girl.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.758
And Samar.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.641
- Why even bring her back?
- She could expose us.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.644
So you're gonna what, burn her?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.429
She is just a child.

24:01.607 --> 24:05.146
The rules are the rules.
There's no way around it.

24:05.319 --> 24:08.687
Look, Vera, I don't like it either.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.611
But it's what has to happen.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.528
It's what's best for everyone.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.245
You said you had some questions.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.672
How does this happen?

24:27.841 --> 24:31.460
How do you close a restaurant down
in the middle of the day?

24:31.637 --> 24:35.722
How can you be so calm when you're
on the FBI's Most Wanted list?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.057
Please.

24:38.519 --> 24:42.354
Would you like coffee? Or tea?
Something to eat?

24:44.525 --> 24:46.482
No. Thank you. Just answers.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.486
You haven't asked any real questions yet.

24:49.655 --> 24:53.274
You've expressed curiosity about...

24:53.450 --> 24:55.988
...the tricks of my trade.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.912
A pedestrian form of legerdemain...

24:59.081 --> 25:02.916
...mastered by any number
of experienced outlaws.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.498
- That's not why you're here.
- No.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.958
Okay, here's a question.
Why am I here?

25:08.132 --> 25:11.421
You wanna know
why your father abandoned you.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.712
I'll have tea.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.047
Green, please.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.933
Sir, sir, I think I found something.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.517
So Jane Doe was found along
a remote road in New Hampshire.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.228
W.P. Frost was found 46 miles
to the south.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.438
- In Grafton County.
- Which is important.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.946
Moore's book refers to something
that he calls an "invocation ceremony."

25:34.116 --> 25:37.325
It's like a baptism.
It takes place in a waterfall.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.907
Out of 85 waterfalls
in New Hampshire...

25:40.080 --> 25:44.074
...twenty-five are in Grafton County,
and one, Stinson Brook Falls...

25:44.251 --> 25:47.415
...is located just two miles
from where Jane Doe was found.

25:47.588 --> 25:52.583
- Does it give us a search parameter?
- No, but this does. Okay.

25:52.760 --> 25:57.175
Tax records deeding 580 acres
of wooded land...

25:57.681 --> 26:01.766
...to a nonprofit entity
the same year that Moore vanished.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.551
Go. Notify the team.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.270
- Thank you, sir.
- For what?

26:06.440 --> 26:09.057
Not saying, "It's gonna be okay."

26:10.944 --> 26:13.436
So you're saying you were framed?

26:13.614 --> 26:16.903
I'm saying a perfectly plausible narrative
was created.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.114
By some shadow government
called the Cabal?

26:20.287 --> 26:22.529
Secret societies exist.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.494
The Cabal, the Trilateral Commission.

26:25.667 --> 26:29.160
Private organizations
that harness powerful forces...

26:29.338 --> 26:31.455
...to tip the scales in their favor.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.214
Military engagements.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.215
U.N. interventions.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.717
Treaties.

26:36.887 --> 26:39.379
The Cabal is the one
I stumbled across...

26:39.556 --> 26:41.388
...and tried to destroy.

26:41.558 --> 26:45.142
To prevent that, they tried to destroy me.

26:45.312 --> 26:48.805
How does you getting targeted
by a scary group of people...

26:48.982 --> 26:52.271
...who think they rule the world
explain why you abandoned us?

26:54.822 --> 26:57.235
You weren't abandoned.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.153
You were protected.

27:00.619 --> 27:04.078
Right. So you forget my ground rules.

27:04.248 --> 27:08.788
Which is I take you to Naomi
in exchange for honest answers.

27:09.795 --> 27:13.539
In 1990, the KGB and the CIA...

27:13.715 --> 27:15.832
...had almost nothing in common...

27:16.009 --> 27:20.754
...except the mutual determination
to hunt down one individual.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.218
- You.
- Being a fugitive...

27:23.392 --> 27:26.100
...from American law enforcement
is easier...

27:26.270 --> 27:30.685
...than being a fugitive from
the two most powerful nations on Earth.

27:30.858 --> 27:36.354
And anyone close to a target
of theirs becomes a target themselves.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.694
- Family.
- Especially family.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.029
Unless they're...

27:42.578 --> 27:44.069
...abandoned...

27:45.038 --> 27:47.075
...on the side of a road...

27:47.958 --> 27:50.416
...on Christmas Eve.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.503
After you left,
we went into Witness Protection.

27:55.424 --> 27:59.589
- Put where the Cabal wouldn't find you.
- Or my father.

28:01.054 --> 28:05.219
An effective
albeit excruciatingly painful solution.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.681
- "Effective"?
- You survived.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.016
As did your mother.

28:11.190 --> 28:15.935
To whom I hope
you are now willing to take me.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.410
Mommy, please, don't let them take me.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.410
Don't listen to her, Pearl.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.922
Don't let that tainted spirit into your head.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.174
Remind yourself she's been infected.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.006
That is not our girl.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.421
No, Mommy! No.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.260
Help me.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.049
No.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.844
Help me.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.058
Mommy, no! Help me!

28:53.232 --> 28:54.643
No.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.148
Mommy.

29:00.447 --> 29:05.363
O God, we humbly beseech thee
for the soul of your servant Maybelle...

29:05.535 --> 29:08.573
...that today thou hast commanded
to depart from us.

29:08.747 --> 29:12.115
That thou wouldst not deliver her
into the hands of the enemy...

29:12.292 --> 29:17.583
...but command that our precious
Maybelle be received by holy angels.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.294
There's something in the trees. The Ollo.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.084
Sound the alarm.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.219
Everybody inside!

29:25.389 --> 29:26.800
Positions.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.216
Mommy. No.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.109
Behind you. Look out. Look out!

29:48.328 --> 29:50.365
We have containment!

29:55.836 --> 29:58.874
It's okay. Maybelle, I'm here to help.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.538
Okay?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.507
Okay. Come on.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.966
- Did you find her?
- Not yet. What do we know?

30:08.140 --> 30:11.929
A dozen inside the big house.
Another 20 in the building behind.

30:12.102 --> 30:15.391
They're armed with older weapons.
My men are clearing outbuildings.

30:15.564 --> 30:18.147
- They're forcing a standoff.
- You haven't found her?

30:18.317 --> 30:20.604
- Found who. Who's this?
- Aram, hold up.

30:20.777 --> 30:23.019
I need a line to speak
to whoever's in charge.

30:24.406 --> 30:27.274
- If they haven't found her, she's inside.
- We don't know that.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.990
Or she's not inside and in more danger.
Someone in there knows.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.325
- We have to go in.
- We can't and you know that.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.831
- HRT's en route.
- We cannot wait for a negotiator.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.913
- We have to do something now.
- Aram...

30:38.086 --> 30:41.250
...I know how scared you are,
but calm down. We have a protocol.

30:41.423 --> 30:45.212
They think we're the enemy.
That we are infected with some virus.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.342
They won't just let us walk in.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.006
Okay. We have a perimeter
at a 100-yard radius.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.221
Snipers on the mark.
State Patrol's flanking along Route 116.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.013
HRT can't land here. Terrain's rough.
We're staging in Benton and driving in.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.056
- How long?
- Hour, 45 minutes tops.

31:00.233 --> 31:03.146
- Did you get that line inside?
- My men can't find phone lines.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.984
- Working on radio... Get him back here!
- Aram. Wait!

31:07.157 --> 31:08.693
What are you doing, Aram?!

31:14.247 --> 31:15.283
Stop him.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.036
That's far enough.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.208
I'm unarmed.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.546
My name is Agent Aram Mojtabai.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.960
I'm with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

31:29.763 --> 31:33.632
There was an FBI way before 1957,
so you know what that is, right?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.596
There's no FBI anymore.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.635
Oh, boy. Okay.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.647
Yeah, see, you think that.

31:40.816 --> 31:45.686
I know you were taught to believe that,
but I'm here.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.445
And, you know, we're here.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.903
And we are not infected.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.693
We are not the Ollo.

31:54.454 --> 31:57.492
- What do you know about the Ollo?
- The things you've been told...

31:57.666 --> 32:01.626
...the story about Carl Davies
and his experiments...

32:01.795 --> 32:05.209
...how he was accidentally stuck
by a needle which triggered a plague...

32:05.382 --> 32:07.294
...it's all fiction.

32:07.467 --> 32:12.007
- You're saying it didn't happen?
- What I'm saying is, it is literally fiction.

32:12.180 --> 32:16.424
This book, this book that I'm holding,
it's called <i>The Age Of Contagion.</i>

32:16.601 --> 32:22.097
And it was written in 1971
by an unemployed aspiring novelist...

32:22.274 --> 32:24.186
...from Tamworth, New Hampshire.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.475
And his name...

32:26.278 --> 32:29.316
His name was Nicholas T. Moore.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.482
- Kit, shut the door.
- He doesn't want you to know the truth.

32:32.659 --> 32:37.279
He doesn't want anybody born here
to know he has been lying to you.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.743
He never even really existed. He's a...

32:39.916 --> 32:43.080
He's just a character who worked
at some made-up company called...

32:43.253 --> 32:46.291
- Cyntax.
- Yes, Cyntax. The fall of Cambridge.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.800
How the plague spread
through Europe to America, it's...

32:51.344 --> 32:53.051
That's chapter three.

32:53.221 --> 32:57.556
A group of survivors survive a plague
and avoid infection.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.093
They then retreat to the wilderness...

33:00.270 --> 33:03.854
...to start their own society, New Haven.

33:04.024 --> 33:05.515
That's enough!

33:06.902 --> 33:11.317
You're him. Nicholas T. Moore.
You tell them.

33:11.490 --> 33:16.030
You thought civilization was doomed,
so you created one of your own...

33:16.203 --> 33:17.865
...based on your book.

33:18.038 --> 33:21.748
Back away now
or I swear, I'll shoot you myself!

33:21.917 --> 33:26.252
I can't do that, not without Agent Navabi,
the one inside. You let her go.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.416
I don't know who that is.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.128
- There's no agent inside.
- Is she hurt?

33:31.301 --> 33:35.420
- Just... Can you tell me if she's okay?
- You heard Mr. Moore. Back away.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.725
- Do it now!
- Okay. Okay. Just read it.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.635
Read it, please.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.849
You will understand everything.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.523
If you just...

33:47.692 --> 33:49.729
Just read it.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.447
Pearl! Pearl, what are you doing?

33:55.617 --> 33:57.279
Pearl, stop.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.068
Stop. Get back in here!

34:11.424 --> 34:15.088
How is this possible? Carl Davies,
the contagion, the Ollo in a book.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.003
- The book is real.
- Every date...

34:17.179 --> 34:20.047
...place, the invocation,
the waterfall, all of it.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.591
No, we wanna hear this.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.851
I got word from my team.
We searched this compound.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.230
- Your agent, she's not here.
- How far is the negotiator?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.766
- Twenty-five minutes.
- If I hear a gun cock...

34:30.944 --> 34:32.480
...we breach on my command.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.987
He spells out the compound, the elders.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.989
Our security measures, the rhyolite.
Is it real?

34:38.159 --> 34:39.900
This is what the Ollo do.

34:41.538 --> 34:45.248
They creep into our minds
and try to corrupt us...

34:46.376 --> 34:49.869
- ...and drive us apart.
- My baby is out there now.

34:50.045 --> 34:51.911
Tell me, is it a lie?

34:54.217 --> 34:55.583
Mother, are you part of this?

34:58.555 --> 35:00.592
Pearl, no. Pearl.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.678
My daughter. Where is she?

35:02.851 --> 35:05.093
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.563
What have you done with my baby girl?

35:10.817 --> 35:16.905
The writings in that book is simply
the story of what is to come.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.199
What does that mean? A story?

35:20.368 --> 35:24.157
A prophecy about the sickness
that's overcome our society...

35:24.331 --> 35:27.244
...one that we must protect
ourselves against.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.077
If you leave, I cannot save you.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.170
Do you hear me?!

35:34.299 --> 35:37.383
I cannot protect you from their plague.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.224
No! Nicholas!

35:50.565 --> 35:52.306
Go now. Breach, breach.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.816
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.781
We searched the entire place.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.363
She's not here, Aram.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.870
I'm sorry.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.668
Hey. Hey, where is she?

36:58.842 --> 37:01.835
Agent Samar Navabi.
You know who I'm talking about.

37:02.011 --> 37:05.550
You're gonna tell me where she is.
Answer me. Where is she?

37:05.724 --> 37:07.761
- Where?
- Gone.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.301
- Gone away.
- Come here.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.390
What do you mean, she's gone?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.772
He knows something.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.484
This cannot be right.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.738
See for yourself.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.924
What happened?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.838
You did.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.804
How?

37:51.728 --> 37:54.015
She was shot twice
coming out of her apartment.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.103
No one knows why.
I thought maybe you did.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.858
No.

38:05.617 --> 38:09.110
You didn't abandon us to protect us.
You just abandoned us.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.413
And you know how I know that?

38:13.583 --> 38:16.621
Because I know what it's like
to have somebody love me so much...

38:16.795 --> 38:19.538
...they would rather cut ties
than see me hurt.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.088
My mom did that.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.418
And not by slinking out
in the middle of the night.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.632
By sitting me down
when I was in college...

38:27.806 --> 38:30.719
...and patiently explaining
how terrified she was of you.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.851
That one day,
you'd want back into my life.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.513
That you'd force her
to tell you where I was.

38:43.112 --> 38:47.732
To protect me from that, from you,
she walked out of my life.

38:49.619 --> 38:52.953
I didn't even know she was dead
until she'd been gone a year.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.282
I'm sorry.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.835
Her husband finally tracked me down.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.090
Told me some enemy of yours
once kidnapped her...

39:05.677 --> 39:07.714
...cut off her finger.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.047
Is that your idea of protection?

39:11.558 --> 39:13.470
No, it's not.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.053
It wasn't nearly enough.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.568
An honest answer at last.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.564
I hope you give me one more
to my final question.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.700
Will you please never contact me again?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.112
Yes.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.166
I'm gonna go.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.002
Leave you to a long-overdue apology.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.821
It's okay, Mom.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.448
Because of your husband, Maybelle's
gonna get the help she needs.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.332
All he cared about was her.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.460
And thanks to him,
she's gonna be okay.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.008
No demands for ransom yet.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.508
<i>- All right.</i>
- I'll call you back.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.388
- Anything?
- No, it's not good.

40:35.558 --> 40:40.349
No sign of the van and zero matches
on the surveillance photo of the unsub.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.855
Reach out to Keen.
Have her notify Red, see if he can help.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.358
Tell her time is of the essence.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.579
Any word from Smokey?

41:06.756 --> 41:08.497
Not yet.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.882
We're waiting on Dr. Lomay.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.136
I asked her to join us.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.967
That won't be happening.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.348
I just spoke to the good doctor.

41:18.518 --> 41:21.727
Imagine my surprise when she told me
you were headed to Costa Rica...

41:21.896 --> 41:24.513
...when you told me
you'd be convalescing at home.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.855
Those were the doctor's orders.
I never said I'd follow them.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.235
I never thought you would,
but you knew that.

41:30.405 --> 41:34.399
Which is why you played that game
with the article about the girl.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.783
You knew I'd clock it, follow up on it...

41:36.953 --> 41:40.196
...and go on a wild-goose chase
while you went after the duffel bag.

41:40.373 --> 41:43.411
Well, best-laid plans.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.877
If you'd excuse us,
we're wheels up in about 10.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.834
I will not excuse you.
You're not going anywhere.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.341
- Why is that?
- Because Samar is missing.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.217
I need your help to find her.
