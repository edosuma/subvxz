00:00.208 --> 00:02.750
<i>Previously, on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:04.583 --> 00:07.208
She was his wife.
He deserves all the facts.

00:07.291 --> 00:11.083
She abandoned her husband
and her son and I'll never forgive her.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.583
<i>It's the age-old question.</i>

00:13.667 --> 00:16.750
<i>How much do we want to know</i>
<i>about our neighbors?</i>

00:16.834 --> 00:19.583
Cancel the meeting
with the divorce lawyer.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.792
We'll find a marriage counselor.

00:21.875 --> 00:24.917
- Mike Delfino.
- Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

00:25.041 --> 00:28.667
- You're gonna have to ask him out.
- I keep hoping he'll ask me out.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.709
I really hate the way you talk to me.

00:30.792 --> 00:34.000
I hate that I spent $15,000
on your diamond necklace,

00:34.083 --> 00:35.834
but I'm learning to deal with it.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.125
- Do you love him?
- I do.

00:38.208 --> 00:41.208
So then why are we here?
Why are we doing this?

00:41.667 --> 00:43.458
I don't want to wake up
one morning,

00:43.542 --> 00:45.500
with a sudden urge
to blow my brains out.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.041
<i>After I died,</i>

00:52.125 --> 00:56.792
<i>I began to surrender the parts of myself</i>
<i>that were no longer necessary.</i>

00:56.875 --> 01:00.709
<i>My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts.</i>

01:00.792 --> 01:04.542
<i>Every trace of my humanity</i>
<i>was discarded.</i>

01:05.625 --> 01:08.208
<i>I discovered,</i>
<i>when moving through eternity,</i>

01:08.291 --> 01:10.542
<i>it helps to travel lightly.</i>

01:11.500 --> 01:15.041
<i>In fact, I held on to only one thing.</i>

01:15.417 --> 01:17.041
<i>My memory.</i>

01:18.375 --> 01:22.291
<i>It's astonishing to look back</i>
<i>on the world I left behind.</i>

01:22.375 --> 01:26.583
<i>I remember it all. Every single detail.</i>

01:29.250 --> 01:32.166
<i>Like my friend, Bree Van De Kamp.</i>

01:34.083 --> 01:37.417
<i>I remember the easy confidence</i>
<i>of her smile.</i>

01:38.583 --> 01:41.667
<i>The gentle elegance of her hands.</i>

01:42.041 --> 01:44.500
<i>The refined warmth of her voice.</i>

01:44.583 --> 01:46.417
Bye.

01:48.959 --> 01:53.333
<i>- But what I remember most about Bree...</i>
- Rex, wasn't that a lovely...

01:53.417 --> 01:56.750
<i>...was the look of fear in her eyes.</i>

01:57.583 --> 02:00.959
<i>Bree had started to realize</i>
<i>her world was unraveling.</i>

02:01.083 --> 02:03.959
<i>And for a woman</i>
<i>who despised loose ends,</i>

02:04.083 --> 02:07.083
<i>that was unacceptable.</i>

02:07.500 --> 02:12.500
- Rex, you need to get up.
- It's not even light out.

02:12.583 --> 02:16.542
If the kids see you down here,
they'll start asking questions.

02:16.750 --> 02:20.500
- Let 'em ask. I don't care anymore.
- Well, I care.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.625
They don't need to be burdened
with our marital problems.

02:23.709 --> 02:26.959
The least we can do
is keep up appearances.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.500
Oh, yeah, appearances.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.417
I keep forgetting about appearances.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.834
Rex, you look so tired.

02:34.917 --> 02:39.291
I didn't sleep.
This damn thing is so uncomfortable.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.458
Why don't you move back upstairs
and sleep in our bed?

02:43.583 --> 02:46.875
We're in marriage counseling.
That would confuse things.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.041
It's just... I miss you.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.125
I know you do.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.000
If I don't start getting
some sleep soon,

02:56.083 --> 02:59.250
I'll be forced back upstairs
out of sheer exhaustion.

03:06.083 --> 03:09.083
<i>Yes, Bree was afraid of many things.</i>

03:09.166 --> 03:12.375
<i>But if there was one thing</i>
<i>she wasn't afraid of...</i>

03:15.417 --> 03:17.333
<i>...it was a challenge.</i>

04:04.458 --> 04:07.750
<i>The day on Wisteria Lane</i>
<i>began like any other</i>

04:07.834 --> 04:11.208
<i>with a cup of coffee</i>
<i>and the morning paper,</i>

04:11.291 --> 04:14.000
<i>and while Lynette read</i>
<i>the business section,</i>

04:14.083 --> 04:16.917
<i>and Gabrielle studied</i>
<i>the fall collections,</i>

04:17.083 --> 04:20.250
<i>and Bree searched</i>
<i>for decorating ideas,</i>

04:20.417 --> 04:26.333
<i>Susan scanned the front page</i>
<i>and saw something that caught her eye.</i>

04:50.208 --> 04:53.834
- It's about time.
- Be nice. I come bearing snacks.

04:53.917 --> 04:56.417
Lynette, these cards are sticky.

04:56.500 --> 05:00.083
I know. Preston used the three
of diamonds to scoop jam out of a jar.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.959
We're just thankful we have
49 cards to play with.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.208
- Hello, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.000
I was just saying
I want to throw a dinner party.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.417
- Really?
- Yes.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.375
I mean, we've never done
a big group thing.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.917
It's a great idea.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.125
Paul never likes to have people over,
but I'm doing it.

05:17.208 --> 05:20.667
- So when is this shindig?
- How about a month from tonight?

05:20.750 --> 05:23.125
- The 16th. Is that good?
- Works for me.

05:23.208 --> 05:26.667
- Shall we all make something?
- Oh, no. This is my party.

05:26.750 --> 05:31.125
I've been wanting to have everyone over
for years. I'm so happy we're doing it.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.500
It's gonna be so much fun.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.750
Hey!

05:35.750 --> 05:38.166
I know. Her dinner.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.667
How could we have all
forgotten about this?

05:40.792 --> 05:44.625
We didn't forget. Usually when
the hostess dies, the party's off.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.417
- Lynette!
- I'm not being flip.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.208
Just pointing out a reality.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.959
Mary Alice was so excited
about it. It's so sad.

05:52.041 --> 05:56.542
- I think we should go through with it.
- Wouldn't that be in poor taste?

05:56.625 --> 06:00.083
No. It's a way to honor Mary Alice.
It was so important to her.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.834
We could all use a fun night.

06:01.959 --> 06:06.000
Good. I have some new flat bread
I've been dying to show off.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.917
- Lynette?
- I'm in.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.125
- I'll make braised lamb shanks.
- I'm still in.

06:11.208 --> 06:12.875
How many will I be cooking for?

06:12.959 --> 06:16.083
Seven. Three couples and Susan.
Does that sound right?

06:16.166 --> 06:20.709
- No, it sounds very, very wrong.
- Is there someone you'd like to invite?

06:30.750 --> 06:33.500
I have an idea.

06:35.959 --> 06:40.625
A dinner party? I may be working late.
The Dillman proposal's a complete mess.

06:40.709 --> 06:43.291
You promised to be home
every night this week.

06:43.375 --> 06:46.709
I'll try, but I can't guarantee
anything. This is business.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.458
Says the prince
as he rides off into the sunset.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.875
Boy, did the movies ever get that wrong.

06:51.959 --> 06:54.250
You know your problem?
You're very tense.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.959
You should go to a spa or go shopping.
Find a way to relax.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.166
- Hello.
- Where are you?

07:14.250 --> 07:16.917
- Algebra.
- Are you free at four?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.083
I'm not sure.
I've got track after school.

07:20.208 --> 07:24.917
Get here as fast as you can.
My husband says I need to relax.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.875
You want me to keep
my gym clothes on like last time?

07:27.959 --> 07:30.250
If you would, please.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.875
- A dinner party?
- Yeah. It'll be fun.

07:32.959 --> 07:36.959
- Bree's cooking. Everyone's going.
- I haven't even unpacked yet.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.542
I just, uh, I just need
to chill out for the next few days.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.125
Tom.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.458
There'll be liquor,
and hors d'oeuvres,

07:45.583 --> 07:49.458
and grown-ups without children,
and silverware.

07:49.583 --> 07:53.125
- Remember silverware?
- Honey, can you take this in for me?

07:53.208 --> 07:56.875
- Have you heard anything I said?
- I'm sorry, I'm wiped out.

07:56.959 --> 08:01.208
Three cities in six days.
I'm not ready for a dinner party.

08:01.291 --> 08:04.250
- I already got a sitter.
- Can't you cancel her?

08:04.333 --> 08:07.291
Please. Let's just stay in
tomorrow night.

08:07.417 --> 08:10.333
We can get a bottle of wine
and rent a video.

08:10.417 --> 08:14.125
I just want to hang out
with my best gal, that's all.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.458
I was looking so forward
to a night out.

08:18.542 --> 08:22.750
I know, sweetie,
I'm sorry, but I'm beat.

08:22.834 --> 08:27.417
I mean, do you remember what
it was like to work a 60-hour week?

08:31.166 --> 08:33.834
A dinner party? Do I have to go?

08:34.667 --> 08:39.792
Given that we're hosting it, I'd say so.
By the way, you won't be drinking.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.333
Why's that?

08:41.417 --> 08:43.625
Because when you drink, you get chatty.

08:43.709 --> 08:46.000
No one need know
we're seeing Dr. Goldfine.

08:46.083 --> 08:50.000
If you spent as much time working
on our problems as covering them...

08:50.083 --> 08:51.208
Not a drop.

08:51.291 --> 08:55.250
This is ridiculous.
And us taking tennis lessons?

08:55.333 --> 08:59.291
Your office may wonder
why you disappear three times a week.

08:59.375 --> 09:02.083
Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.458
So, these tennis lessons.
How are we doing?

09:07.542 --> 09:11.333
My backhand's improving,
but you have problems with your serve.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.041
Of course.

09:14.750 --> 09:15.792
A dinner party?

09:15.875 --> 09:18.959
It's tomorrow night,
so keep Julie an extra day.

09:19.041 --> 09:22.417
Fine. But that's all. Brandi and I
leave Sunday for the cabin.

09:22.542 --> 09:23.917
What cabin?

09:24.041 --> 09:26.792
Brandi wanted someplace
we could get away.

09:26.875 --> 09:30.208
Escrow just closed yesterday.

09:30.291 --> 09:33.041
You can afford a cabin,
but not child support?

09:33.125 --> 09:37.542
- The check is in the mail.
- No, it's not.

09:38.125 --> 09:40.333
I found my dental guard. I'm ready.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.333
Stop fighting.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.792
We're being as nice
as we possibly can.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.041
Like I said, stop fighting.

09:59.417 --> 10:03.041
Excuse me, Brandi, do you mind?

10:07.083 --> 10:10.333
- OK.
- Wait. Susan, you're right there.

10:10.417 --> 10:14.166
- You could pick it up.
- I could, but she threw it.

10:14.959 --> 10:19.000
- Don't be petulant. Pick up the can.
- No.

10:19.083 --> 10:22.750
- I can pick it up.
- Honey, stay out of this.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.500
Fine. This is so typical.

10:31.959 --> 10:36.959
- I'm sorry. Was that petulant too?
- Pick up the damn can yourself.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.792
Yeah, well, you just go to hell.

10:44.291 --> 10:45.875
You want me to pick it up?

10:56.625 --> 11:00.625
Mrs. Warmington said she looked for
Mom's obituary and couldn't find it.

11:00.709 --> 11:05.166
- Did you put one in?
- I've had other things on my mind.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.875
How could you not do that?
People will think we didn't care.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
I doubt people will give it much
thought. Don't worry about it.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.166
You never talk about her.

11:17.291 --> 11:21.041
She's been dead a month and it's
like you've forgotten she existed.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.250
It's a little early
for this kind of talk.

11:25.542 --> 11:29.792
Maybe when you die,
I won't put in an obituary.

11:31.333 --> 11:35.333
That will be your choice to make.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.959
Assuming you outlive me.

11:44.792 --> 11:48.875
Mom, it's no big deal. We're driving
in for the baptism. Problem solved.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.959
OK. Fine. You go with Aunt Maria,

11:53.041 --> 11:56.125
and I will take Nana to church.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.250
Take your clothes off.

11:58.333 --> 12:01.166
OK, I got to go, Mom.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.125
Yes, right now.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.875
OK. You can give me
directions later. Bye.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.667
- Hi, how was school?
- Got an A-minus in my biology exam.

12:09.750 --> 12:13.834
You did? Mmm. Well,
let's see what you've learned.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.041
Who's that?

12:19.166 --> 12:20.834
I don't know.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.959
Hey, you!

12:31.041 --> 12:32.667
So, did Mike say anything?

12:32.750 --> 12:35.583
No, but you should've seen
the look on his face.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.792
I'm sure it's not that bad.
He's coming to the party, right?

12:39.875 --> 12:43.291
I left three messages.
He's not going to come. Big surprise.

12:43.375 --> 12:47.500
I did everything but foam at the mouth.
I hate when I get that way.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.500
Every time I get within ten feet
of Karl, I just become this monster.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.542
It's not gonna change
until you resolve your issues.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.500
You mean, forgive him?

12:56.583 --> 13:00.333
I've lived with this bitterness so long,
I'd be lonely without it.

13:00.417 --> 13:03.917
Honey, get a pet. See ya.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.542
- Son of a...
- It's a business meeting.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.125
It's a frat party.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.208
Regional manager,
corporate manager, head of sales.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.083
Margarita, cigar, sombrero.

13:16.166 --> 13:20.917
Ah, honey, what do you want me to do?
Sit around the hotel watching cable?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.500
No, but when I say
we've been invited to a party,

13:24.625 --> 13:27.875
don't whine about
your exhausting 60-hour week.

13:27.959 --> 13:32.417
Put on your dancing shoes and take your
children's mother out for a good time.

13:32.500 --> 13:36.041
Fine. You're right.
Let's go to that party.

13:36.125 --> 13:39.959
- I already cancelled the sitter.
- OK. We'll throw the next one.

13:40.041 --> 13:44.125
Throw a dinner party?
I don't even have time to wash my face.

13:47.125 --> 13:50.333
No. You know what?
I'm gonna go to this one.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.375
You can stay home and baby sit.

13:52.458 --> 13:56.166
Fine. I can handle that.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.083
Thank you.

14:12.166 --> 14:17.458
<i>Gabrielle spent her morning searching</i>
<i>for the mysterious little girl.</i>

14:17.542 --> 14:19.500
<i>Sadly for her...</i>

14:20.834 --> 14:24.625
<i>...the mystery was solved</i>
<i>a bit too quickly.</i>

14:28.417 --> 14:30.917
Hey. What's going on?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.458
Have you met Ashley?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.000
Found it.

14:37.083 --> 14:40.625
This is Sheila Bukowski. They moved
into the Miller's old house.

14:40.709 --> 14:43.709
My daughter left her ball
in your yard. I'm so sorry.

14:43.792 --> 14:48.041
Oh, no problem.
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.125
She's shy. She doesn't say much.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.542
Yeah, but I can see
her little mind working away.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.041
Nice meeting you.

15:01.875 --> 15:05.750
Come on, Ashley.

15:40.625 --> 15:45.458
Private sessions?
Why do we need private sessions?

15:45.542 --> 15:49.750
Private sessions allow us to work on
the personal issues of both partners.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.208
I don't have any.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.875
My only issue is that
my husband wants to leave.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.083
How can I work on that
if he's not there?

15:56.166 --> 16:01.041
There are things I need to discuss with
Dr. Goldfine and I can't have you there.

16:01.125 --> 16:05.291
Why? I'm your wife.
You can say anything in front of me.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.667
All we need is a few more sessions...

16:07.750 --> 16:11.959
Damn it, Bree, a few more sessions
isn't gonna fix us.

16:12.041 --> 16:15.208
This is bigger than that.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.500
Why don't we do it this way?

16:17.625 --> 16:22.583
Rex, you can take the first half-hour.
Bree, you can take the second.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.333
Fine.

16:26.417 --> 16:30.250
Oh, and doctor, if what he's about to
discuss has anything to do with

16:30.333 --> 16:33.208
adultery, prostitution
or internet pornography,

16:33.291 --> 16:36.375
I would really appreciate you
taking a moral hard line.

16:51.375 --> 16:55.083
Hi, Ashley, remember me?

16:55.166 --> 16:57.083
We met earlier.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.500
Wow! Aren't you the little artist.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.250
What are those? Flamingos?

17:04.333 --> 17:06.000
No.

17:07.917 --> 17:13.750
Well, they're very pretty.
It almost looks like they're kissing.

17:13.834 --> 17:17.834
Funny thing about kissing.
It's not just for husbands and wives.

17:17.959 --> 17:21.291
Sometimes we kiss our mom,
or our grandpa,

17:21.375 --> 17:23.667
sometimes we even kiss our dog.

17:23.750 --> 17:27.709
Sometimes we even kiss people
who are just our friends.

17:27.834 --> 17:31.500
Kind of like a high five
on the lips, right?

17:35.667 --> 17:37.458
Hey, Ash!

17:37.542 --> 17:42.000
I was at the mall and I saw this.
Thought you might like it.

17:42.083 --> 17:46.291
She's Hawaiian.
Her name is Princess Kaha'lua.

17:46.375 --> 17:50.792
And I think it means "little waterfall"
or "big pond" or something.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.041
OK. So we're good, right?

18:00.959 --> 18:04.166
OK. Well, you enjoy
your new little friend,

18:04.250 --> 18:07.750
and if there's anything else
you need, you just let me know.

18:09.208 --> 18:12.709
What I'd really like is a bike.

18:41.458 --> 18:46.291
- Where did you find that?
- She used this to kill herself.

18:46.375 --> 18:50.125
Why would you keep it? Why?

18:52.125 --> 18:54.583
- We might need it someday.
- For what?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.667
- Protection.
- I want to talk about mom.

18:57.792 --> 19:01.208
- Take your medication.
- We're going to talk about mom.

19:12.125 --> 19:16.917
Hello, Zach,
I hope this isn't a bad time.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.041
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Van De Kamp?

19:21.125 --> 19:25.125
I wanted to invite you and your
father to a dinner party tomorrow night.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.166
I'm not sure where he is right now.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.542
Oh, well, I'm sorry
it's such late notice,

19:30.625 --> 19:36.709
but we weren't sure that you were ready
for any kind of social engagement.

19:36.834 --> 19:39.750
We're throwing it
in your mother's honor.

19:41.458 --> 19:42.625
Really?

19:42.709 --> 19:45.583
Yes, it's just a casual night
with the gang.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.959
We're going to eat and tell fun stories
about your mom.

19:52.709 --> 19:55.166
Zach, are you OK?

19:57.375 --> 20:00.208
- Hello, Bree.
- Hi, Paul. I was just...

20:00.333 --> 20:03.875
I heard. Thank you.
But we already have plans for tomorrow.

20:05.375 --> 20:07.792
That's too bad.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.625
Well, I should go.

20:14.291 --> 20:18.542
- Thank you, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- For what, Zach?

20:20.333 --> 20:23.208
Remembering my mom.

20:28.041 --> 20:32.166
<i>That night, Paul gave his son</i>
<i>something to calm his nerves.</i>

20:32.250 --> 20:35.667
<i>And the next day,</i>
<i>Gabrielle calmed her own nerves,</i>

20:35.750 --> 20:38.959
<i>by giving something</i>
<i>to her new best friend.</i>

20:39.041 --> 20:43.625
Here you go. Top of the line,
three-speed, aluminum frame,

20:43.709 --> 20:45.834
handle-bar ribbons and a bell.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.750
It's royal blue to match
your pretty little eyes.

20:48.834 --> 20:51.500
My eyes are green.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.083
You'll be cruising so fast on this,
no one will even notice.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.667
It's all yours, honey. Have fun.

21:03.083 --> 21:06.041
- What? What's wrong?
- I don't know how to ride a bike.

21:07.166 --> 21:11.083
What? Then why did you ask for one?

21:11.208 --> 21:13.417
Why can't you show me?

21:13.542 --> 21:17.792
Sure. One of these days.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.875
What's wrong with now?

21:27.417 --> 21:29.333
<i>After her talk with Lynette,</i>

21:29.417 --> 21:32.625
<i>Susan decided to take a look</i>
<i>at her old photo album.</i>

21:33.375 --> 21:36.667
<i>And she began to see herself</i>
<i>in a whole new light.</i>

21:36.750 --> 21:39.917
<i>And the picture wasn't flattering.</i>

21:51.375 --> 21:55.041
<i>Yeah, you got Karl.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

21:55.125 --> 21:58.333
Hey, Karl, it's me.
I was hoping you'd be there.

21:58.458 --> 22:00.333
Listen. We need to talk.

22:00.417 --> 22:03.834
So maybe when
you drop Julie off tomorrow,

22:03.959 --> 22:08.333
we could have a moment.
It's important.

22:08.417 --> 22:12.834
Give my best to...Brandi.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.959
Call me.

22:18.667 --> 22:24.834
<i>Susan was proud of herself. She was</i>
<i>finally ready to let go of her anger.</i>

22:28.000 --> 22:31.250
<i>Well, almost.</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:38.208
- Mom!
- The boys will be hungry at 5.30.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.125
So put the fish sticks
in the toaster oven at five.

22:41.208 --> 22:44.458
For half an hour.
That's the third time you've told me.

22:44.542 --> 22:46.542
If the food's late, God help you.

22:46.667 --> 22:49.792
I don't need a pamphlet.
It's not brain surgery.

22:49.875 --> 22:52.166
They're just kids, for God's sake.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.875
Preston, would you come here.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.250
Yeah.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.709
Sweetie, you know our rule
about eating cookies, right?

23:01.792 --> 23:04.834
We can't have 'em after five
'cause sugar makes us hyper.

23:04.917 --> 23:09.041
Yeah. But tonight, anything goes.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.959
- Share with your brothers.
- Thanks, Mom.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.291
Don't look at your feet.
Look at the road.

23:21.375 --> 23:25.083
Look at the road.
Good. Uh, OK, find your balance.

23:25.166 --> 23:29.709
Find your balance. OK. It's all you.
It's all you. You're doing great!

23:30.417 --> 23:33.542
OK, stay to the right.
Watch the car. Watch the car!

23:36.291 --> 23:38.542
Oh, God!

23:39.583 --> 23:42.625
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, let's go again.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.417
These heels don't have
another block in them.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.166
What about tomorrow?

23:47.250 --> 23:51.333
Well, you won't be around
tomorrow 'cause you have school.

23:51.417 --> 23:54.333
I'm home schooled. I'm always around.

23:54.417 --> 23:57.500
<i>It was in that moment</i>
<i>that Gabrielle realized,</i>

23:57.583 --> 24:01.000
<i>this ride was far from over.</i>

24:03.250 --> 24:04.750
I'm coming.

24:08.917 --> 24:11.542
Why are you here?
I asked you to come tomorrow.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.917
You wanted to talk.
It sounded important.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.917
- Tomorrow. I'm in a towel.
- We were married 14 years.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.417
I know what's under there. Come on.

24:23.709 --> 24:27.917
I'm not really ready for this. I was
going to have a whole speech prepared.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.250
Brandi and I have plans tomorrow.
I suggest you wing it.

24:39.000 --> 24:45.083
Here's the thing. I was thinking about
what happened in the driveway yesterday.

24:45.166 --> 24:49.959
And I just don't want to...
I don't want to live like that.

24:50.041 --> 24:52.667
I don't want to be that kind of person.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.917
I just thought, if the two of us...
You know, if we had a nice, calm...

24:57.000 --> 25:01.291
- I need an apology, Karl.
- A what?

25:01.375 --> 25:06.792
An apology. For the way you ended our
marriage. You never took responsibility.

25:06.875 --> 25:12.375
I don't know what to say, Susan.
The heart wants what it wants.

25:12.500 --> 25:16.083
- What does that mean?
- I fell in love.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.333
While you were married
to someone else.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.583
The heart wants what it wants.

25:22.667 --> 25:26.458
Yeah, well, my heart wants
to hurt you, but I can control myself.

25:26.542 --> 25:29.083
I don't want to go back
to that ugly place,

25:29.166 --> 25:33.250
and if you do,
I suggest you get some help.

25:34.333 --> 25:38.792
You know what, I don't need an apology.
I don't need anything from you.

25:38.875 --> 25:44.083
- You're humiliating yourself.
- You're the one who's been humiliated.

25:44.208 --> 25:48.917
You walked out on your family.
People think you're scum, not me.

25:49.041 --> 25:51.834
So worry about yourself. I'm OK with me.

25:51.917 --> 25:55.625
I can walk down the street
and hold my head high.

26:26.875 --> 26:30.709
<i>As the sun slowly settled</i>
<i>on Wisteria Lane,</i>

26:30.792 --> 26:36.041
<i>an unsettled Susan racked her brain</i>
<i>to find a way into her own house.</i>

27:14.375 --> 27:17.333
<i>Lying naked in her shrubs,</i>
<i>it occurred to Susan</i>

27:17.417 --> 27:20.792
<i>this could be the most humiliating</i>
<i>moment of her life.</i>

27:22.166 --> 27:25.375
- Susan?
<i>- She was wrong.</i>

27:25.458 --> 27:31.250
- What you doing?
- Locked myself out. Naked.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.333
And then I fell.

27:34.417 --> 27:37.000
- So how are you?
- Good. Good.

27:37.083 --> 27:42.083
I just got back. I've been gone all day
and I got your messages about dinner.

27:42.166 --> 27:44.834
I'd love to come,
if the invite still stands.

27:44.917 --> 27:50.834
- It's a date.
- Right. I assume the dress is casual.

27:50.917 --> 27:53.709
Yeah. It's casual.

28:02.166 --> 28:06.625
Thanks for helping me break in.
Will it be hard to replace that screen?

28:06.709 --> 28:11.041
That depends. If you nail it in
yourself, you might want to wear gloves.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.959
Or pants. Pants wouldn't hurt.

28:15.041 --> 28:19.291
OK. I know what just happened
is funny in theory,

28:19.375 --> 28:24.250
but I'm nowhere near ready to laugh
about it, so, please, no jokes.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.542
Hey, where have you two been?

28:26.625 --> 28:30.125
Susan had a problem
finding something to wear.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.166
- Was that what you meant?
- Pretty much.

28:33.250 --> 28:36.291
The kids are bouncing
off the walls?

28:36.375 --> 28:39.375
I'm sure you can figure a way
to put them to bed.

28:39.458 --> 28:42.542
For God sakes,
Tom, they're just kids.

28:45.125 --> 28:46.959
Hey, are you OK?

28:47.041 --> 28:51.959
Yes, I went jogging today
and I think I pushed myself too hard.

28:52.041 --> 28:54.542
You're probably not wearing
the right shoes.

28:54.625 --> 28:57.875
Yeah, that thought did cross my mind.

28:58.208 --> 29:01.417
Gabrielle says you're taking
lessons three times a week.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.750
I'm thinking about playing again.
It's great exercise.

29:04.834 --> 29:08.625
- That it is.
- My drop shot needs a tune up.

29:08.709 --> 29:10.917
Could you give me
the number of your pro?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.667
- Yeah. I'll give it to you later.
- What club does he work out of?

29:18.375 --> 29:22.250
We're not really
taking tennis lessons, Carlos.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.291
You're not?

29:24.375 --> 29:29.333
It's a story Bree concocted to cover the
fact we're seeing a marriage counselor.

29:33.959 --> 29:37.750
He wouldn't
stop asking about the tennis pro.

29:40.250 --> 29:43.417
Bree and I are in marriage counseling.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.250
Everyone knows now.

29:46.333 --> 29:50.542
Did the sky fall?
Has your life come crashing down?

29:56.583 --> 30:00.792
If everybody would please
take your seats, dinner is served.

30:25.125 --> 30:27.667
<i>A grisly discovery</i>
<i>was made today</i>

30:27.792 --> 30:29.917
<i>when a chest was found</i>
<i>in Rockwater Lake</i>

30:30.000 --> 30:33.917
<i>by a local businessman and</i>
<i>his grandson while they were fishing.</i>

30:34.000 --> 30:36.625
<i>Investigators recovered a wooden chest</i>

30:36.709 --> 30:40.166
<i>containing what appear</i>
<i>to be human remains.</i>

30:40.250 --> 30:42.417
<i>A police spokesman says</i>
<i>the body was...</i>

31:22.834 --> 31:26.542
OK, I got to break the ice here.
You're in counseling? Big deal.

31:26.625 --> 31:29.667
You want humiliation,
I'll give you humiliation.

31:29.750 --> 31:34.083
I locked myself out of my house
stark naked and got caught by Mike.

31:34.166 --> 31:37.792
- Oh, my God. When did this happen?
- Today. Right before the party.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.417
What can I say?
Right place, right time.

31:41.208 --> 31:45.250
I can top that. Getting thrown
out of Disneyland for lewd behavior.

31:45.333 --> 31:46.542
When was this?

31:46.709 --> 31:50.625
When we were first married, things got
out of hand on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.875
You're kidding?

31:51.959 --> 31:55.417
No. We got perp-walked
down Main Street U.S.A.

31:56.417 --> 32:00.834
Since we're doing true confessions,
we once broke a water bed in Cancun.

32:00.917 --> 32:03.500
- How?
- He had a thing for spiked heels.

32:03.583 --> 32:08.166
I'd like to make it clear,
she was wearing them.

32:10.625 --> 32:14.542
Rex cries after he ejaculates.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.250
- Think we left too early?
- I was thinking we left too late.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.458
So is Rex gone for good?

32:52.583 --> 32:55.375
I don't know. God, I hope not.

32:55.458 --> 32:59.875
They've always been wound tight,
but I've never seen 'em like that.

32:59.959 --> 33:01.375
Who am I to judge?

33:01.458 --> 33:05.083
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw soda cans?

33:05.166 --> 33:08.750
OK, you have got to know that
I only get that angry around Karl.

33:08.834 --> 33:13.625
He treated me so badly at the end,
I haven't been able to get past it.

33:13.750 --> 33:17.208
- Maybe he did you a big favor.
- What do you mean?

33:17.291 --> 33:20.625
Look at Karl as
a starter marriage, boot camp,

33:20.709 --> 33:23.834
preparing you for
something better next time.

33:25.667 --> 33:29.709
Listen, Mike, about the whole
seeing me naked thing,

33:29.792 --> 33:35.583
I just want to thank you
for being such a perfect gentleman.

33:35.667 --> 33:39.458
I wasn't a perfect gentlemen.
I might have snuck a peek.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.500
Good night!

33:43.583 --> 33:45.667
And for what it's worth...

34:03.875 --> 34:05.250
Hi.

34:05.333 --> 34:09.750
- How was your night?
- We are raising little terrorists.

34:09.834 --> 34:13.875
- You know that, don't you?
- Didn't have a good time?

34:14.000 --> 34:18.041
OK, you know, drop the act.
I know you gave them cookies.

34:18.834 --> 34:21.500
Who cracked anyway?

34:21.583 --> 34:23.333
Porter.

34:23.417 --> 34:26.458
Yeah. So how was your dinner party?

34:26.542 --> 34:29.458
There was dinner,
but it wasn't much of a party.

34:29.542 --> 34:32.208
- What happened?
- I don't know.

34:32.291 --> 34:35.375
Rex announced that
he and Bree are in counseling.

34:35.458 --> 34:39.750
She retaliated with this whole
revelation which I won't go into,

34:39.834 --> 34:42.125
and the bottom line is,
he stormed out.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.583
Clearly, there's trouble in paradise.

34:44.667 --> 34:48.000
- Honestly, I'm not that surprised.
- Why not?

34:48.083 --> 34:51.417
I just never got the idea
that they were really happy.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.917
Are we happy?

35:09.583 --> 35:15.750
Man, oh, man. I keep seeing that look
on Rex's face. Then him taking off.

35:15.875 --> 35:17.917
Some night.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.709
Then again, I'd probably cry too
if I had to have sex with that woman.

35:22.792 --> 35:25.709
You watch a man
get torn down like that,

35:25.792 --> 35:28.083
you wonder why
he let her get away with it.

35:28.166 --> 35:31.959
Believe me, if a woman ever
humiliated me like that in public...

35:32.041 --> 35:34.959
It would only happen once.

35:42.417 --> 35:47.375
- So where are you going?
- I'll be staying at the motor lodge.

35:47.458 --> 35:51.709
The hotel by the interstate has better
rates and it's closer to your work.

35:51.792 --> 35:54.500
Fine.

35:54.583 --> 35:57.083
I'm packing your swimsuit.

35:57.166 --> 36:00.291
There's a pool there
and I know how swimming relaxes you.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.291
When our kids ask where I am,
what are you gonna say?

36:05.834 --> 36:09.333
I could tell them
that you went to tennis camp.

36:09.417 --> 36:13.000
- That was a joke.
- Yeah. I got it.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.291
There.

36:17.375 --> 36:22.542
Obviously, if you've forgotten anything
you can come right back and get it.

36:22.625 --> 36:24.667
Well, I'll call you.

36:30.583 --> 36:35.000
In college, when we first started
dating, people were so jealous of us.

36:35.125 --> 36:39.667
We were the golden couple. Everybody
knew we'd have this wonderful life.

36:39.750 --> 36:43.000
Why is this happening?

36:45.875 --> 36:49.542
Because you can't even
let me pack my own suitcase.

37:15.875 --> 37:18.291
All right. See ya. Have fun.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.792
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Just a sec.

37:20.917 --> 37:23.792
- Mom?
- Don't worry I'm not packing heat.

37:23.875 --> 37:27.583
Hey, Brandi, could you scoot a little?

37:27.667 --> 37:30.750
Just scoot. Thank you. Hi.

37:30.834 --> 37:33.208
- What are you doing?
- I'll be quick.

37:33.291 --> 37:35.458
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

37:35.583 --> 37:39.083
It was uncalled for and childish,
and it won't happen again.

37:39.166 --> 37:42.291
I have built up
a lot of anger towards you, both of you.

37:42.375 --> 37:45.542
And I realize now
I can't carry that around anymore.

37:45.625 --> 37:50.750
So apology or no apology,
I'm moving on.

37:57.166 --> 38:01.000
- Mrs. Mayer.
- Brandi. Brandi, get in the car.

38:01.083 --> 38:05.000
- Mrs. Mayer.
- Please, call me Susan.

38:06.875 --> 38:10.667
I just wanted you to know,
what happened between me and Karl,

38:10.750 --> 38:15.458
things got out of hand because
I thought your marriage was over.

38:15.542 --> 38:18.917
Anyway, I just wanted you to know
I'm sorry, I really am.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.458
Thank you.

38:26.625 --> 38:29.834
<i>And though it came from</i>
<i>an unexpected source,</i>

38:29.959 --> 38:34.417
<i>Susan finally got the apology</i>
<i>she'd always wanted.</i>

38:39.250 --> 38:43.458
Hey, let me take those.

38:46.792 --> 38:50.709
- You're wearing a really big hat.
- Yes, I am.

38:50.792 --> 38:53.000
Listen, the kids are watching a video

38:53.083 --> 38:57.875
which means we've got only about 45
minutes until they actually find Nemo,

38:57.959 --> 39:01.667
so I suggest
that we make the most of it.

39:01.792 --> 39:04.041
By reliving your night out
with the guys?

39:08.166 --> 39:10.291
I'm trying.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.500
You look ridiculous in that thing.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.667
Sexy ridiculous?

39:24.458 --> 39:25.917
Maybe.

39:27.667 --> 39:31.291
I can live with "maybe".

39:40.709 --> 39:45.625
You know, it's gonna take
more than just this one night.

39:45.709 --> 39:47.375
I know.

39:54.375 --> 39:57.333
It looks like we have an audience.

39:59.709 --> 40:03.875
Let 'em look. As long as
they don't try and cut in.

40:13.792 --> 40:18.000
- Dr. Goldfine.
- Bree. We're not scheduled now, are we?

40:18.083 --> 40:21.875
I didn't have time to make an
appointment. Rex moved out today.

40:21.959 --> 40:26.750
I'm very sorry to hear that,
but I'm completely booked right now.

40:26.834 --> 40:31.208
I don't need much time. You have more
insight into my situation than I do.

40:31.291 --> 40:33.417
Bree, we can't talk now.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.750
If you tell me what he told you,
then I could fix the problem.

40:36.875 --> 40:40.875
- I can't do that. It's unethical.
- Why can't you...?

40:40.959 --> 40:43.917
That's my next appointment.
You really need to go.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.083
Dr. Goldfine, please.

40:47.458 --> 40:50.875
Hold on, I'll go and talk to my client.

41:15.959 --> 41:21.542
<i>Bree searched for Rex's</i>
<i>audio tape hoping to find answers.</i>

41:21.625 --> 41:23.625
<i>She found answers all right...</i>

41:24.250 --> 41:27.625
<i>...but to entirely different questions.</i>

41:27.709 --> 41:31.709
OK. Yeah, I'll be out in just a moment.

41:36.875 --> 41:39.500
Bree, I'm sorry, he can't wait.

41:39.583 --> 41:43.166
But I can see you first thing
in the morning, eight o'clock.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.750
Eight o'clock.

41:45.834 --> 41:48.291
Sorry to interrupt. Bye.

41:57.417 --> 42:01.834
<i>Yes, I remember the world, every detail.</i>

42:02.625 --> 42:06.417
<i>And what I remember most</i>
<i>is how afraid I was.</i>

42:06.500 --> 42:08.750
<i>What a waste.</i>

42:08.834 --> 42:12.166
<i>You see, to live in fear</i>
<i>is not to live at all.</i>

42:14.500 --> 42:18.375
<i>I wish I could tell this</i>
<i>to those I left behind.</i>

42:18.458 --> 42:21.291
<i>But would it do any good?</i>

42:21.375 --> 42:23.709
<i>Probably not.</i>

42:24.709 --> 42:30.875
<i>I understand now. There will always</i>
<i>be those who face their fears.</i>

42:33.125 --> 42:37.917
<i>And there will always</i>
<i>be those...who run away.</i>
