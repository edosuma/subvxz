00:06.298 --> 00:07.842
( â™ª )

00:10.051 --> 00:12.554
(Theme music, honky tonk style)

00:19.728 --> 00:21.814
(Sizzling)

00:21.856 --> 00:24.900
(Exhaling)

00:27.528 --> 00:29.864
(Ice rattling in glass)

00:32.366 --> 00:35.828
Do you guys just hang

00:32.366 --> 00:35.828
out all day waiting?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.955
You guys are fucked.

00:37.997 --> 00:39.623
(Door handle clicking)

00:37.997 --> 00:39.623
Ricky:

00:37.997 --> 00:39.623
Ughh!

00:39.665 --> 00:42.167
Boys, get up.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.167
Let's go.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.167
Ughh!

00:42.209 --> 00:44.085
Ricky, get up.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.085
Julian...

00:44.127 --> 00:46.045
(Groaning)

00:44.127 --> 00:46.045
let's go,

00:44.127 --> 00:46.045
upsie-doodles.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.673
Bubs, close the

00:46.087 --> 00:47.673
fucking door.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.216
Bubbles:

00:47.715 --> 00:49.216
No, we've got

00:47.715 --> 00:49.216
to get moving.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.926
We've got to get at

00:49.257 --> 00:50.926
these tasks, let's go.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.678
Who bent my fucking

00:50.968 --> 00:52.678
neck like this, boys?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.930
Thanks.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.930
Ricky, come on.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.598
Get up.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.598
Julian:

00:54.972 --> 00:56.598
I need to go to a bar.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.266
No, we don't need

00:56.640 --> 00:58.266
to go to a bar,

00:58.308 --> 00:59.518
we need to get

00:58.308 --> 00:59.518
moving here.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.769
Get these in you.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.480
Best hangover cure

01:00.811 --> 01:03.480
you'll ever have.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.940
What the fuck

01:03.522 --> 01:04.940
is that?

01:03.522 --> 01:04.940
Here.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.483
Is there booze in it?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.483
(Groaning in pain)

01:06.525 --> 01:08.443
Fuck...

01:06.525 --> 01:08.443
There's no booze

01:06.525 --> 01:08.443
in it, no.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.946
Julian:

01:08.485 --> 01:10.946
Then fucking ram it

01:08.485 --> 01:10.946
up your ass then,

01:08.485 --> 01:10.946
I don't want it.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.489
I'll drink the

01:10.988 --> 01:12.489
fucking thing.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.742
My head feels like

01:12.531 --> 01:14.742
it's going to pop off

01:14.783 --> 01:16.702
my fucking sexy body.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.702
Chug it, Ricky.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.537
Best hangover cure

01:16.744 --> 01:18.537
you'll ever have.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.706
Chug the whole thing.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.499
I got a serious

01:20.748 --> 01:22.499
situation here.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.919
The boys are all fucked up

01:22.541 --> 01:24.919
from doing mushrooms

01:24.960 --> 01:27.379
and I've got to make

01:24.960 --> 01:27.379
some serious task

01:24.960 --> 01:27.379
money in a hurry.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.048
I mean, I've got

01:27.421 --> 01:29.048
to get a guitar

01:29.088 --> 01:31.675
and get to Sun Studios,

01:29.088 --> 01:31.675
legendary Sun Studios,

01:31.717 --> 01:33.301
where all the

01:31.717 --> 01:33.301
legends recorded.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.887
I'm going to record

01:33.343 --> 01:34.887
there today,

01:34.929 --> 01:36.263
record a hit song.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.806
I've just got to

01:36.304 --> 01:37.806
get the boys up

01:37.848 --> 01:39.558
and get them motivated

01:37.848 --> 01:39.558
to do these tasks.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.477
The tasks are fucked,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.477
but they are doable.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.605
Come on, we get

01:43.020 --> 01:44.605
at the task,

01:44.646 --> 01:46.231
we get me

01:44.646 --> 01:46.231
a cheap guitar

01:46.273 --> 01:48.483
and then we go to

01:46.273 --> 01:48.483
the fucking studio.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.110
Julian:

01:48.525 --> 01:50.110
Where are we going?

01:50.151 --> 01:51.820
Bubs...

01:51.862 --> 01:53.697
The fucking...

01:51.862 --> 01:53.697
The magic spell,

01:53.739 --> 01:55.449
I don't think

01:53.739 --> 01:55.449
it worked.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.284
I going to have

01:55.490 --> 01:57.284
to deal with these

01:55.490 --> 01:57.284
little fuckers

01:57.325 --> 01:58.619
at some point today.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.370
Well, you can deal

01:58.660 --> 02:00.370
with them later, Ricky.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.747
Come on,

02:00.412 --> 02:01.747
let's go, boys.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.832
(Sighing)

02:01.789 --> 02:03.832
(Stomach gurgling)

02:03.874 --> 02:05.542
Let's go.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.542
All right, let's go.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.542
Okay.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.919
Let's get this

02:05.584 --> 02:06.919
fucking over with.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.796
(Gurgling continues)

02:06.961 --> 02:08.796
Uh-oh. Uh-oh...

02:08.837 --> 02:12.299
Boys... this thing

02:08.837 --> 02:12.299
is making me...

02:08.837 --> 02:12.299
(Clearing throat)

02:12.340 --> 02:13.842
I feel I'm going

02:12.340 --> 02:13.842
to repaint the

02:12.340 --> 02:13.842
fucking van here.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.929
Okay, Ricky, I'm going

02:13.884 --> 02:16.929
to need you to just...

02:16.971 --> 02:19.431
hang on to that one for a bit.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.516
Boys, I don't know.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.516
Like, I don't think

02:19.473 --> 02:21.516
I'll make it.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.685
Can't we just shit

02:21.558 --> 02:23.685
in any toilet?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.685
What's the...

02:23.727 --> 02:25.353
No.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.353
They're not going

02:23.727 --> 02:25.353
to fucking know

02:23.727 --> 02:25.353
what toilet it is.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.064
It's a gold

02:25.395 --> 02:27.064
toilet, Ricky!

02:27.106 --> 02:28.941
Who the fuck has

02:27.106 --> 02:28.941
a gold toilet?

02:28.983 --> 02:30.609
Julian:

02:28.983 --> 02:30.609
Elvis.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.609
Elvis, it's the only one.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.860
The King of rock and roll.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.654
It just says,

02:31.902 --> 02:33.654
"Ricky to take piss

02:33.695 --> 02:36.197
"in Elvis' gold toilet

02:33.695 --> 02:36.197
for 100 bucks

02:36.239 --> 02:39.118
or take a shit without

02:36.239 --> 02:39.118
flushing it for 1,000."

02:39.159 --> 02:41.369
You've got to go for

02:39.159 --> 02:41.369
the 1,000 though, Ricky.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.831
There's no question

02:41.411 --> 02:43.831
I'm going for the fucking

02:41.411 --> 02:43.831
1,000 here, boys,

02:43.872 --> 02:45.206
it's just a matter

02:43.872 --> 02:45.206
of timing.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.167
No, you can hang on.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.167
We're almost there.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.419
How close are we?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.419
We got about eight miles.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.921
20 minutes.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.921
20 m...!

02:50.963 --> 02:52.213
Boys, I'm not going

02:50.963 --> 02:52.213
to make 20...

02:52.255 --> 02:53.590
You're going to have

02:52.255 --> 02:53.590
to pull over, man.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.842
No, Ricky, no!

02:53.632 --> 02:54.842
We can...

02:53.632 --> 02:54.842
(Farting)

02:54.883 --> 02:56.468
you can make it.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.468
Come on.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.387
Oh, my fuck, Ricky.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.387
It's just

02:56.510 --> 02:59.387
venting so far.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.973
But we've got...

02:59.429 --> 03:00.973
you're going to

02:59.429 --> 03:00.973
have to pull over.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.307
No, Ricky.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.307
I'm not going

03:01.015 --> 03:02.307
to make it.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.558
You could hold

03:02.349 --> 03:03.558
it, Ricky!

03:02.349 --> 03:03.558
(Fierce farting)

03:03.600 --> 03:04.810
Hang onto it,

03:03.600 --> 03:04.810
hang onto it!

03:04.852 --> 03:06.269
No, it's coming,

03:04.852 --> 03:06.269
it's coming!

03:06.311 --> 03:08.147
No, Ricky!

03:06.311 --> 03:08.147
Just pinch it!

03:06.311 --> 03:08.147
(Wet farts)

03:08.229 --> 03:09.439
Ricky:

03:08.229 --> 03:09.439
It's like a tidal wave.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.274
Ricky, no.

03:09.481 --> 03:11.274
Ricky, come on!

03:11.316 --> 03:12.776
Get back in the van.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.776
Bubbles,

03:12.818 --> 03:14.611
what the fuck was

03:12.818 --> 03:14.611
in that drink, man?

03:14.653 --> 03:17.739
Ricky, just get back

03:14.653 --> 03:17.739
in the van, come on.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.825
(Gurgling continues)

03:17.781 --> 03:19.825
Hey! How's it going?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.743
I need to get the

03:19.867 --> 03:21.743
fuck in there now

03:21.785 --> 03:23.495
and I've got to

03:21.785 --> 03:23.495
use the bathroom.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.706
I'm going to

03:23.537 --> 03:25.706
shit myself.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.706
Ah, I'm sorry, sir.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.582
We won't be open for

03:25.747 --> 03:27.582
another 10 minutes.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.751
Well...

03:27.624 --> 03:29.751
You'll have to find a

03:27.624 --> 03:29.751
public washroom somewhere.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.003
10 minutes isn't

03:29.793 --> 03:31.003
going to happen.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.379
Look, I'm going to

03:31.045 --> 03:32.379
shit myself now.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.672
I've got to get

03:32.420 --> 03:33.672
the fuck in there.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.923
Sir, if you will

03:33.714 --> 03:34.923
watch your language...

03:34.965 --> 03:36.175
Sir, get off my gate.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
I'll have to

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
call the police.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.969
Julian: Get off...

03:37.759 --> 03:38.969
Bubbles:

03:37.759 --> 03:38.969
Ricky, Ricky...

03:39.011 --> 03:40.345
Oh, my fuck.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.345
Come on.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.430
Julian:

03:40.387 --> 03:42.430
He's got to go,

03:40.387 --> 03:42.430
man, come on!

03:42.472 --> 03:44.558
I'm sorry, we're not

03:42.472 --> 03:44.558
a public restroom,

03:42.472 --> 03:44.558
we're a historical site.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.643
Don't be a shit inhibitor.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.643
I've got to get in there now

03:46.685 --> 03:47.936
or I'm going to shit

03:46.685 --> 03:47.936
in my pants

03:47.978 --> 03:49.730
in front of all these

03:47.978 --> 03:49.730
fucking people.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.523
Are you cool with that?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.523
Sir, your

03:49.771 --> 03:51.523
language, all right?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.317
If you want to come in,

03:51.565 --> 03:54.317
you can take a place

03:51.565 --> 03:54.317
in the line.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.903
Oh, you don't like

03:54.359 --> 03:55.903
my fucking language?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.654
I'm going to shit myself!

03:55.944 --> 03:57.654
Bubbles: Ricky...

03:57.696 --> 03:59.990
Well, not here. Why don't

03:57.696 --> 03:59.990
you go across the street

04:00.032 --> 04:01.366
and maybe there's a restroom.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.660
Come on, Ricky, we can

04:01.408 --> 04:03.660
make it, we can make it.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.495
Think about

04:03.702 --> 04:05.495
something else.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.495
Count sheep.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.164
Bubs...

04:05.537 --> 04:07.164
(Loud gurgling)

04:07.206 --> 04:08.874
Ricky...

04:07.206 --> 04:08.874
Ah, fuck.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.417
Ricky, what

04:08.916 --> 04:10.417
are you doing?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.669
Ricky, no! Ricky!

04:10.458 --> 04:12.669
Ahhh...

04:10.458 --> 04:12.669
No, no, no, no!

04:12.711 --> 04:13.962
(Loud squelching, farting)

04:12.711 --> 04:13.962
No, Ricky!

04:14.004 --> 04:16.173
Ugh!

04:14.004 --> 04:16.173
Oh, my fuck.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.926
Happy? I just shit

04:16.215 --> 04:18.926
in my fucking pants

04:18.967 --> 04:21.053
because of you.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.053
Sorry, everybody.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.056
Not my fault.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.056
Ricky. Ricky...

04:24.098 --> 04:25.807
Oh, my God,

04:24.098 --> 04:25.807
he shit himself.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.935
(Relieved sigh)

04:25.849 --> 04:27.935
I feel good now, boys.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.228
I feel great,

04:27.976 --> 04:29.228
actually.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.813
Ricky...

04:29.269 --> 04:31.813
Oh, my God!

04:31.855 --> 04:33.398
I'm going to probably

04:31.855 --> 04:33.398
have to do some clean-up,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.234
but I feel fucking

04:33.440 --> 04:35.234
a lot better.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.069
Let's go somewhere

04:35.275 --> 04:37.069
to clean him up.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.069
What are we doing?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.612
What's up, what's up?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.612
What's next?

04:38.653 --> 04:40.697
Oh, just...

04:40.739 --> 04:43.784
We've got to

04:40.739 --> 04:43.784
clean you up,

04:40.739 --> 04:43.784
you fucking idiot!

04:43.825 --> 04:45.285
Yeah, it's not

04:43.825 --> 04:45.285
good. It's bad.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.870
Ricky...

04:45.326 --> 04:46.870
Oh, my God!

04:46.912 --> 04:48.956
I can't believe

04:46.912 --> 04:48.956
you just did that.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.044
I can't believe

04:50.999 --> 04:54.044
I miscalculated the

04:50.999 --> 04:54.044
amount of prunes.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.921
Fuck, I should've

04:54.086 --> 04:55.921
researched it more.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.756
Fuck, do you think?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.050
Jesus.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.050
Holy fuck, that

04:57.798 --> 05:00.050
was a messy one.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.760
Ricky! Ricky,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.595
do I look like

05:01.802 --> 05:03.595
a fucking paper

05:01.802 --> 05:03.595
towel to you?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.014
Are you sure you

05:03.637 --> 05:06.014
cleaned yourself up

05:03.637 --> 05:06.014
real good?

05:06.056 --> 05:07.808
Yeah, it's all good

05:06.056 --> 05:07.808
down there now, except...

05:07.849 --> 05:09.851
the fucking crabs.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.851
A couple more

05:07.849 --> 05:09.851
joined the party.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.271
It's out of control.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.271
We should get the

05:09.893 --> 05:12.271
fuck out of here.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.231
I'm pretty sure

05:12.312 --> 05:14.231
my underwear clogged

05:12.312 --> 05:14.231
the fucking toilet.

05:14.273 --> 05:16.191
You flushed it down

05:14.273 --> 05:16.191
the fucking toilet?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.068
I wasn't going to

05:16.233 --> 05:18.068
put them back on,

05:16.233 --> 05:18.068
they were fucked!

05:18.110 --> 05:19.987
Ricky, you could've

05:18.110 --> 05:19.987
just put them

05:18.110 --> 05:19.987
in the garbage.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.571
No, I was proud

05:20.028 --> 05:21.571
of those guys.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.282
Did their job,

05:21.613 --> 05:23.282
contained everything.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.366
I was like, "Boys,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.366
fucking job well done."

05:25.408 --> 05:27.327
Gave them a salute,

05:25.408 --> 05:27.327
sent them on their

05:25.408 --> 05:27.327
way with honour,

05:27.368 --> 05:29.621
right down the

05:27.368 --> 05:29.621
fucking toilet.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.291
(Scoff)

05:29.663 --> 05:32.291
He's saluting

05:29.663 --> 05:32.291
his underwear now.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.459
Who the fuck does that?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.461
Well, that's it, boys.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.461
I don't get

05:36.503 --> 05:38.005
to fucking

05:36.503 --> 05:38.005
record in Memphis.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.714
Lifelong dream gone.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.966
What else is

05:39.756 --> 05:40.966
on the list?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.926
It's just bullshit.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.638
Fucking kidnap the

05:42.968 --> 05:46.638
governor of Tennessee

05:46.680 --> 05:47.973
for an hour

05:46.680 --> 05:47.973
for 1,000 bucks.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.599
Yeah, okay.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.599
Let's fucking do that.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.518
It can't be that hard.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.518
We're not doing that.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.187
That's just fucking

05:51.559 --> 05:53.187
Swearnet fucking

05:51.559 --> 05:53.187
around with us.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.814
Ricky, we'd go to jail

05:53.228 --> 05:55.814
forever if we did that.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.356
Think about it.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.356
If we get caught.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
Let's just go

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
to a fucking bar

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
and get wasted

05:59.109 --> 06:01.069
then, I guess.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.238
Oh, there's a good idea.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.238
Let's just walk into a bar.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.948
Hi there, I'd like

06:03.280 --> 06:04.948
a bunch of drinks.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.574
Here's some fucking

06:04.990 --> 06:06.574
pocket lint.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.035
You know what

06:06.616 --> 06:08.035
we should do?

06:08.076 --> 06:10.954
We should go to a

06:08.076 --> 06:10.954
fucking karaoke bar.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.954
Why?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.207
Bubs, you get up on

06:10.996 --> 06:13.207
stage, sing a song,

06:13.248 --> 06:14.457
you might get

06:13.248 --> 06:14.457
discovered in this town.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.459
Oh, so I get up

06:14.499 --> 06:16.459
on stage

06:16.501 --> 06:18.461
and I play my arse

06:16.501 --> 06:18.461
off all day

06:18.503 --> 06:20.881
and you get to weasel

06:18.503 --> 06:20.881
some fucking free

06:18.503 --> 06:20.881
chicken wings

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
and free drinks. Okay.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
That's a good

06:20.922 --> 06:23.091
idea, buddy.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.510
Thanks, man.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.510
It's not about the

06:23.133 --> 06:25.510
free chicken wings

06:25.552 --> 06:27.470
and free drinks, man.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.470
It's about you

06:25.552 --> 06:27.470
getting on stage,

06:27.512 --> 06:30.224
singing, and

06:27.512 --> 06:30.224
fucking getting

06:27.512 --> 06:30.224
discovered, man.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.851
What do you mean,

06:30.265 --> 06:32.851
"getting discovered"?

06:30.265 --> 06:32.851
Bubs, we're in Memphis.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.562
There's scouts in

06:32.893 --> 06:35.562
every fucking bar

06:32.893 --> 06:35.562
in town here.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.813
What do you

06:35.603 --> 06:36.813
mean, "scouts"?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.148
Like, a hockey

06:36.855 --> 06:38.148
team, "scouts"?

06:38.190 --> 06:39.691
Man, Sun Records,

06:39.733 --> 06:40.984
I guarantee you they

06:39.733 --> 06:40.984
have fucking scouts

06:41.026 --> 06:42.401
in every bar

06:41.026 --> 06:42.401
in this town

06:42.443 --> 06:43.904
just waiting for

06:42.443 --> 06:43.904
the next person

06:42.443 --> 06:43.904
to come in,

06:43.945 --> 06:46.447
get up on stage

06:43.945 --> 06:46.447
and become a star.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.617
Do you think they

06:46.489 --> 06:49.617
have scouts, really?

06:46.489 --> 06:49.617
Of course they do!

06:49.659 --> 06:52.411
How do you think

06:49.659 --> 06:52.411
fucking Elvis got

06:49.659 --> 06:52.411
discovered, man?

06:52.453 --> 06:53.914
He went into

06:52.453 --> 06:53.914
a karaoke bar,

06:53.955 --> 06:56.083
all banged up on pills

06:53.955 --> 06:56.083
and liquor and stuff,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.293
got up on stage and

06:56.124 --> 06:58.293
boom! He's Elvis.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.006
I don't know if

06:59.586 --> 07:03.006
that's historically

06:59.586 --> 07:03.006
accurate, Julian.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.342
Maybe. Maybe...

07:03.048 --> 07:05.342
(Guitar strumming)

07:05.384 --> 07:07.010
Check it out, Bubs.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.427
This guy's playing

07:07.052 --> 07:08.427
that Diane Sawyer

07:07.052 --> 07:08.427
song you like.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.513
â™ª Tom Sawyer, Tom Sawyer â™ª

07:10.555 --> 07:12.682
â™ª Tom Sawyer, Tom Sawyer â™ª

07:12.724 --> 07:14.017
That's Alex Lifeson.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.518
That's Alex Lifeson

07:14.059 --> 07:15.518
from Rush.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.687
That's not Alex...

07:15.560 --> 07:17.687
<i>That is him,</i>

07:17.729 --> 07:19.564
I'm fucking tell...

07:17.729 --> 07:19.564
What would he be doing

07:17.729 --> 07:19.564
here on the sidewalk?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.649
I don't know, but

07:19.606 --> 07:21.649
I'm telling you,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.649
that's him.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.945
I guaran-fucking-tee you

07:21.691 --> 07:24.945
that's him.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.406
Hey, Alex!

07:24.986 --> 07:27.406
Oh, my God!

07:27.447 --> 07:29.532
How you doing?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.532
It's Bubbles, hey!

07:29.574 --> 07:31.410
Yeah, Bubbles, Bubbles.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.410
I was your guitar tech.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.786
Remember?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.786
In Halifax.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.786
Yeah, yeah.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.579
Yeah, in Halifax.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.579
It's him!

07:34.621 --> 07:36.331
Oh, Dicky! How

07:34.621 --> 07:36.331
you doing, buddy?

07:36.373 --> 07:37.999
Julian, right?

07:36.373 --> 07:37.999
What's up, man?

07:36.373 --> 07:37.999
Yeah, yeah.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.293
What are you doing

07:38.041 --> 07:39.293
in Memphis?

07:39.334 --> 07:40.585
Why are you out

07:39.334 --> 07:40.585
in the street

07:40.627 --> 07:42.254
playing the guitar

07:40.627 --> 07:42.254
with the wig on?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.505
Yeah, it's a long...

07:42.296 --> 07:44.505
a long story.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.549
If you got a few minutes,

07:44.547 --> 07:46.549
I'd be happy to tell you.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.801
It's great to see you.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.052
I... pff!

07:47.842 --> 07:49.052
Are you kidding me?

07:49.094 --> 07:50.762
I'd love to hear it.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.762
Yeah,

07:50.804 --> 07:52.513
want to grab maybe

07:50.804 --> 07:52.513
a bite to eat

07:50.804 --> 07:52.513
or something?

07:52.555 --> 07:54.224
Uh...

07:52.555 --> 07:54.224
We don't have any

07:52.555 --> 07:54.224
fucking money.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.850
Bubbles:

07:54.266 --> 07:55.850
He's got...

07:54.266 --> 07:55.850
He's Alex Lifeson.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.685
Oh, no, no, I got money.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.685
I got a lot of money.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.937
Bubbles:

07:57.727 --> 07:58.937
He's got money.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.688
Yeah, I got...

07:58.979 --> 08:00.688
I got money here.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.232
Yeah. Lunch is

08:00.730 --> 08:02.232
on me, fellas.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.733
I even got enough

08:02.274 --> 08:03.733
for a drink.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.568
We can share a drink.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.568
Let's go to lunch!

08:05.610 --> 08:06.820
Right on,

08:05.610 --> 08:06.820
let's do it.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.820
Yeah.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.991
Guys, I'm just

08:08.571 --> 08:10.991
going to leave this

08:08.571 --> 08:10.991
stuff on, okay?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.742
'Cause, you know,

08:11.032 --> 08:12.742
lots of fans.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.742
Oh, absolutely.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.411
Ahhh...

08:12.784 --> 08:14.411
Holy fuck!

08:12.784 --> 08:14.411
Thanks, honey.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.663
Right on!

08:14.453 --> 08:16.663
Look at that thing!

08:16.704 --> 08:18.332
My God, this

08:16.704 --> 08:18.332
is unbel...

08:18.373 --> 08:20.583
I can't believe I'm

08:18.373 --> 08:20.583
sitting here with you.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.127
I can't believe it.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.127
I mean,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.004
after I worked for you

08:22.169 --> 08:24.004
at the Rush concert,

08:24.045 --> 08:26.631
I tried to contact you

08:24.045 --> 08:26.631
a whole bunch of times,

08:26.673 --> 08:28.300
but I never heard

08:26.673 --> 08:28.300
back from you.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.551
I don't recall hearing

08:28.342 --> 08:30.551
from you, actually.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.845
Really? 'Cause...

08:31.886 --> 08:33.596
that number you

08:31.886 --> 08:33.596
wrote down for me,

08:33.638 --> 08:35.182
I called that

08:33.638 --> 08:35.182
probably...

08:35.223 --> 08:37.851
800 or 900

08:35.223 --> 08:37.851
times and...

08:37.892 --> 08:40.020
left messages.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.020
I called

08:37.892 --> 08:40.020
Anthem Records,

08:40.061 --> 08:43.023
I tried to get you on

08:40.061 --> 08:43.023
the Facebook machine.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.150
Well, I... You know,

08:43.064 --> 08:45.150
I get so many messages,

08:45.192 --> 08:46.651
and I don't get

08:45.192 --> 08:46.651
all my messages.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.196
Especially since

08:46.693 --> 08:49.196
I don't have

08:46.693 --> 08:49.196
a phone anymore.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.489
Yeah? Well,

08:49.237 --> 08:50.489
that makes sense.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.533
That makes sense.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.369
Are you guys going

08:53.574 --> 08:55.369
to order anything?

08:55.410 --> 08:57.496
Al, you ordered

08:55.410 --> 08:57.496
a 12-pound fucking

08:55.410 --> 08:57.496
burger, man.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.039
I thought you

08:57.537 --> 08:59.039
were going to

08:57.537 --> 08:59.039
share it with us.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.415
Oh, no, no, no.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.749
I get this for free

09:01.791 --> 09:03.793
from Sean, the owner here,

09:03.835 --> 09:06.713
so I can eat for a week.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.215
I told you we have

09:06.754 --> 09:08.215
no fucking money.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.884
Oh, I thought you guys

09:08.256 --> 09:10.884
were joking about that.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.095
No, we weren't.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.095
We don't have a pot

09:10.925 --> 09:14.095
to piss in.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.847
Really? Not a penny

09:14.137 --> 09:15.847
between you?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.392
Bubbles:

09:15.889 --> 09:18.392
Nothing. Nothing, no.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.935
Oh. Well, what are you

09:18.433 --> 09:20.935
doing here, anyways?

09:20.977 --> 09:24.772
Well, the

09:20.977 --> 09:24.772
Swearnet TV people

09:20.977 --> 09:24.772
that we work for,

09:24.814 --> 09:26.691
they sent us down

09:24.814 --> 09:26.691
with the cameras

09:26.733 --> 09:29.610
and they gave

09:26.733 --> 09:29.610
us all these crazy

09:26.733 --> 09:29.610
tasks to do and...

09:29.652 --> 09:31.405
Julian:

09:29.652 --> 09:31.405
It's impossible.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.405
They gave us these tasks

09:31.446 --> 09:32.655
that we can't fucking do.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.908
It's a waste of time.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.908
Really?

09:34.949 --> 09:37.077
It's kind of like being

09:34.949 --> 09:37.077
on a trip from hell.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.870
There's nothing

09:37.118 --> 09:38.870
we can do about it.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.997
But what are you

09:38.912 --> 09:40.997
doing down here?

09:38.912 --> 09:40.997
That's the big question.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.208
What are you doing

09:41.039 --> 09:43.208
playing out on

09:41.039 --> 09:43.208
the streets?

09:47.379 --> 09:49.214
(Melancholy music playing)

09:49.256 --> 09:52.217
Well, Bubbles,

09:49.256 --> 09:52.217
it's a long story.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.468
When things

09:52.259 --> 09:53.468
ended with Rush,

09:53.510 --> 09:55.220
I was kind of lost.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.638
I had all this money

09:57.680 --> 10:00.600
and guitars and

09:57.680 --> 10:00.600
houses and...

10:00.641 --> 10:02.519
cars and...

10:03.228 --> 10:05.063
and I was just

10:03.228 --> 10:05.063
really lost.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.357
I partied like

10:05.105 --> 10:07.357
crazy and...

10:07.399 --> 10:08.649
and before I knew it,

10:08.691 --> 10:10.777
I wasn't the only

10:08.691 --> 10:10.777
thing that was lost.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.028
My wallet was lost.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.155
I... Everything

10:12.070 --> 10:14.155
was gone.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.156
Broke.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.824
Oh, my God.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.285
How did you lose

10:16.866 --> 10:18.285
yourself though?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.203
I mean, if you're

10:18.326 --> 10:20.203
yourself,

10:20.245 --> 10:22.456
you'd probably know

10:20.245 --> 10:22.456
where you would be.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.291
You just didn't have

10:22.497 --> 10:24.291
any fucking mirrors

10:24.332 --> 10:27.085
in your big fancy

10:24.332 --> 10:27.085
rock house and

10:24.332 --> 10:27.085
fucking craziness.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.587
Bubbles:

10:27.127 --> 10:28.587
Ricky.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.587
Ricky:

10:27.127 --> 10:28.587
What?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.837
That's not what he means.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.006
No, Ricky, it isn't.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.384
I was spiritually lost.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.512
I didn't know

10:34.426 --> 10:37.512
who I was anymore.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.890
I was tired of

10:37.554 --> 10:40.890
the whole arenas and...

10:40.932 --> 10:42.559
and limousines

10:42.601 --> 10:44.144
and cars and...

10:42.601 --> 10:44.144
and girls.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.687
I-I had no interest

10:44.185 --> 10:46.687
in playing anymore.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.066
I... I didn't want

10:46.729 --> 10:50.066
to do anything.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.943
I barely showered.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.945
I went a couple days

10:51.985 --> 10:53.945
without swallowing.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.823
It was that bad.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.823
I was just lost

10:56.864 --> 10:59.742
and I needed to get

10:56.864 --> 10:59.742
back to my roots.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.742
(Frustrated spluttering)

10:59.784 --> 11:02.703
So to get back to your

10:59.784 --> 11:02.703
roots, you just put on

10:59.784 --> 11:02.703
a fucked up-looking wig

11:02.745 --> 11:05.624
and some weird fucking teeth,

11:02.745 --> 11:05.624
go out in the street,

11:02.745 --> 11:05.624
look like a goddamn idiot?

11:05.665 --> 11:06.874
Bubbles:

11:05.665 --> 11:06.874
Ricky! Ricky...

11:06.916 --> 11:08.209
Alex:

11:06.916 --> 11:08.209
That's not what I mean.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.461
I just got to

11:08.251 --> 11:09.461
cut the bullshit.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.463
I've just got to be pure

11:11.505 --> 11:14.924
and... and in touch

11:11.505 --> 11:14.924
with myself

11:14.966 --> 11:17.511
and the people

11:14.966 --> 11:17.511
that love my music.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.346
That's... See that, boys?

11:19.387 --> 11:20.847
Ricky:

11:19.387 --> 11:20.847
What?

11:19.387 --> 11:20.847
See that?

11:20.888 --> 11:23.433
I wish I was a fucking

11:20.888 --> 11:23.433
big rock star

11:23.475 --> 11:25.477
that had crashed

11:23.475 --> 11:25.477
to the bottom

11:25.519 --> 11:27.354
and had to get

11:25.519 --> 11:27.354
back to his roots.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.605
That'd be fucking amazing,

11:28.647 --> 11:30.231
and I thought that...

11:30.273 --> 11:31.732
that actually

11:30.273 --> 11:31.732
might happen today,

11:31.774 --> 11:33.109
but it doesn't

11:31.774 --> 11:33.109
look like it now.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.653
Why? What happened?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.655
Well, Ricky was

11:34.693 --> 11:36.655
supposed to take a shit

11:36.695 --> 11:37.989
in Elvis' gold toilet,

11:38.031 --> 11:39.240
and we were going

11:38.031 --> 11:39.240
to take the money

11:39.282 --> 11:41.201
and get me

11:39.282 --> 11:41.201
a cheap guitar

11:41.242 --> 11:43.161
and go down

11:41.242 --> 11:43.161
to Sun Studios,

11:41.242 --> 11:43.161
you know,

11:43.203 --> 11:46.331
and I was going

11:43.203 --> 11:46.331
to record a song

11:43.203 --> 11:46.331
that I wrote,

11:46.373 --> 11:47.999
maybe be a big

11:46.373 --> 11:47.999
country star.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.586
What... what...

11:48.041 --> 11:51.586
what about Elvis?

11:51.628 --> 11:52.837
What was that?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.255
He was supposed

11:52.879 --> 11:54.255
to take a dump

11:54.297 --> 11:55.840
in Elvis' toilet

11:54.297 --> 11:55.840
for 1,000 bucks

11:55.882 --> 11:57.300
which impossible

11:55.882 --> 11:57.300
to fucking do...

11:57.342 --> 11:59.927
and not flush.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.927
It's fucked.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.388
Those guys make

11:59.969 --> 12:01.388
you do that?

12:01.429 --> 12:02.721
Julian:

12:01.429 --> 12:02.721
Well, they're fucked

12:01.429 --> 12:02.721
in the head.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.224
They do make us

12:02.763 --> 12:04.224
do that.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.185
And then Ricky shit

12:04.265 --> 12:07.185
himself at the gates

12:07.227 --> 12:10.146
and my dreams went

12:07.227 --> 12:10.146
right down the toilet

12:10.188 --> 12:11.565
with his underwear.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.277
Well, dreams come

12:13.066 --> 12:16.277
back, Bubbles.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.196
I'm going to help you

12:16.319 --> 12:18.196
with your dream.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.614
I'm going to get

12:18.238 --> 12:19.614
you a guitar,

12:19.656 --> 12:21.282
I'm going to get you

12:19.656 --> 12:21.282
a couple hours at Sun,

12:21.324 --> 12:23.243
I'll go down

12:21.324 --> 12:23.243
and talk to them.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.243
We'll book it.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.663
What? You know the

12:23.284 --> 12:26.663
people at Sun Studios?

12:26.705 --> 12:29.916
Well, I don't

12:26.705 --> 12:29.916
<i>know them</i> know them,

12:29.957 --> 12:33.628
but we are all brothers

12:29.957 --> 12:33.628
in the world of music,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.422
and I'm sure I can

12:33.670 --> 12:35.422
talk to them.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.298
It'd be no problem

12:35.463 --> 12:37.298
at all.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.509
Oh, my God, boys,

12:37.340 --> 12:39.509
did you hear that?

12:39.551 --> 12:41.886
Did you hear that?

12:39.551 --> 12:41.886
Alex Lifeson's going

12:39.551 --> 12:41.886
to get me a guitar

12:41.928 --> 12:43.555
and get me into

12:41.928 --> 12:43.555
Sun Studios.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.555
Well, we heard.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.014
Like, he's sitting

12:43.597 --> 12:45.014
right there, so I...

12:45.056 --> 12:46.641
I'm hearing everything

12:45.056 --> 12:46.641
he's saying, right?

12:46.683 --> 12:49.227
I just mean, Ricky,

12:46.683 --> 12:49.227
he's going to

12:46.683 --> 12:49.227
give me a guitar

12:49.269 --> 12:50.645
and get me into Sun.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.689
I'm going to<i> loan</i>

12:50.687 --> 12:52.689
you a guitar.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.315
Let's be clear.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.315
I'm going to<i> loan</i>

12:52.731 --> 12:54.315
you a guitar.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.735
Okay, that's fine.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.735
That's all I need.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.653
Julian:

12:56.775 --> 12:58.653
Okay, all right,

12:56.775 --> 12:58.653
let's get this

12:56.775 --> 12:58.653
going, let's go.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.947
Pack that fucking

12:58.695 --> 13:00.947
thing up.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.947
Okay, all right.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.115
Excuse me!

13:02.156 --> 13:04.492
Can I have a box here?

13:04.534 --> 13:06.244
So you were saying

13:04.534 --> 13:06.244
you had tons of cash

13:06.286 --> 13:08.580
and cars and shit, and

13:06.286 --> 13:08.580
you blew it all, huh?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.582
Well, you know,

13:08.622 --> 13:10.582
you get into that

13:08.622 --> 13:10.582
frame of mind

13:10.624 --> 13:11.958
and, uh, and it goes,

13:11.999 --> 13:13.334
but you know,

13:11.999 --> 13:13.334
I'm not an idiot.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.961
I still got some.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.046
Julian and Ricky:

13:15.002 --> 13:17.046
Holy fuck! Are

13:15.002 --> 13:17.046
you kidding me?

13:17.088 --> 13:18.339
Bubbles:

13:17.088 --> 13:18.339
Check it out!

13:17.088 --> 13:18.339
A Bentley,

13:18.381 --> 13:19.549
a real Bentley!

13:21.217 --> 13:23.595
Julian & Bubbles:

13:21.217 --> 13:23.595
What's he doing?

13:21.217 --> 13:23.595
Oh, boys...

13:23.637 --> 13:25.472
Guys.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.472
Julian:

13:23.637 --> 13:25.472
This one?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.390
Oh, an SLS!

13:27.432 --> 13:28.807
Check it out.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.807
(Laughing)

13:27.432 --> 13:28.807
Oh, my God,

13:28.849 --> 13:31.018
you drive this

13:28.849 --> 13:31.018
piece of shit?

13:28.849 --> 13:31.018
Ricky!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.020
Ricky!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.020
What?

13:31.060 --> 13:33.020
Well, Bubs,

13:33.062 --> 13:35.814
this is the shittiest-

13:33.062 --> 13:35.814
looking car I've ever

13:33.062 --> 13:35.814
seen in my fucking life.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.902
There, unlock the

13:37.900 --> 13:39.902
fucking doors.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.902
Alex:

13:37.900 --> 13:39.902
Pop in, buddy.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.904
Uh, you might

13:39.944 --> 13:41.904
just have to clear

13:39.944 --> 13:41.904
some stuff there.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.364
(Indistinct)

13:43.406 --> 13:46.033
I've never been in

13:43.406 --> 13:46.033
a real Cadillac before.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.368
It's a fucking Cadillac!

13:47.410 --> 13:49.120
Al, what, do you live

13:47.410 --> 13:49.120
in this fucking thing?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.997
(Exhaling)

13:51.038 --> 13:52.206
Alex:

13:51.038 --> 13:52.206
Oh...

13:53.832 --> 13:57.044
Julian:

13:53.832 --> 13:57.044
Fuck!

13:53.832 --> 13:57.044
(Car door scraping ground)

13:57.086 --> 13:59.798
Careful, you'll

13:57.086 --> 13:59.798
scrape the paint.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.633
Man, this thing

13:59.838 --> 14:01.633
is great on gas.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.762
Bubbles:

14:03.968 --> 14:05.762
This is the actual factory?

14:05.804 --> 14:07.846
Yeah, this is it! This

14:05.804 --> 14:07.846
is... it happens here!

14:07.888 --> 14:10.016
This is awesome.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.016
This is where they make

14:07.888 --> 14:10.016
the guitars, boys.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.225
Alex:

14:10.057 --> 14:11.225
Here it is.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.312
Boys, check that out!

14:14.354 --> 14:15.563
Holy fuck,

14:14.354 --> 14:15.563
is that real?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.315
Guitar central.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
Guitar central!

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
Holy fuck...

14:17.357 --> 14:19.484
Love it!

14:19.526 --> 14:21.235
look at the guitars

14:19.526 --> 14:21.235
in here, boys,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.235
check it out.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.780
Bubbles: (Whispering)

14:22.570 --> 14:23.780
Holy fuck.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.032
Hey, Judy-y!

14:23.822 --> 14:26.032
Hi.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.867
Hi!

14:26.073 --> 14:27.867
Um... can I help you?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
Can I see

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
Walter, please?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
What?

14:29.285 --> 14:30.911
Yeah, Walter.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.911
Walter, please.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.911
Oh, Walter.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.163
Sorry, he's

14:30.953 --> 14:32.163
in a meeting.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.665
He can't meet with

14:32.205 --> 14:33.665
you right now.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.124
Just give him a buzz.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.124
Tell him Alex is here.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.418
Umm, yeah,

14:35.166 --> 14:37.418
I can't do that.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.920
Besides, um...

14:37.460 --> 14:39.920
I'm sorry, Alex?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.798
Alex, Alex...

14:39.962 --> 14:41.798
Judy:

14:39.962 --> 14:41.798
Sorry.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.758
(Pop, clattering)

14:43.800 --> 14:46.219
Sorry, Alex Lifeson.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.180
From... from Rush,

14:46.260 --> 14:49.180
Alex Lifeson.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.182
Oh... my God,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.182
are you serious?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.517
Yeah, I'm pretty serious.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.517
Oh, so sorry.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.101
I think I am.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.101
Alex! Of course.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.895
Yeah, thanks, thanks.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.895
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.397
No problem.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.397
I'll call him

14:55.936 --> 14:57.397
right now, yeah.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.898
Just hold on a moment.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.107
(Grunting)

15:02.235 --> 15:03.444
Hey, Walter.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.572
Yeah, sorry to

15:03.486 --> 15:05.572
disturb you, I know.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.699
Uh, but Alex Lifeson...

15:07.741 --> 15:09.367
Yeah, from Rush,

15:07.741 --> 15:09.367
yeah. He's here.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.702
In the lobby, yeah.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.370
Okay, see you

15:10.744 --> 15:12.370
in a sec.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.706
He'll be right down.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.706
Awesome, great.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.706
Thank you.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.457
Sorry, I didn't recognize

15:14.748 --> 15:16.457
you.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.457
That's okay. Oh, no,

15:14.748 --> 15:16.457
no, that's okay.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.084
Ricky:

15:16.499 --> 15:18.084
These are fucked,

15:16.499 --> 15:18.084
just so you know.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.544
Judy:

15:18.125 --> 15:19.544
Okay, can you put

15:18.125 --> 15:19.544
that down? Thanks.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.920
(Whispering)

15:19.586 --> 15:20.920
Boys, check this out.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.672
25 grand for that baby.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.716
Wow, there must be

15:22.714 --> 15:24.716
something wrong with it.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.716
(Laughing)

15:24.758 --> 15:25.966
Walter:

15:24.758 --> 15:25.966
Alex!

15:24.758 --> 15:25.966
That's awesome.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.386
Hey, Walter!

15:26.008 --> 15:28.386
Good to see you, man.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.137
How you doing, buddy?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.137
Good to see you, bro.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.972
Good to see you

15:30.179 --> 15:31.972
too. Listen, these

15:30.179 --> 15:31.972
are my friends,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.183
Bubbles.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.183
Hi.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.183
Ricky, Julian.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.394
Hey, man.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.394
Walter.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.394
Welcome to Gibson.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.187
That's quite a coat.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.187
Thank you,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.187
thank you.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.606
Manuel, Nashville.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.441
Oh, awesome.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.441
(Indistinct comments)

15:41.482 --> 15:42.734
So, great to

15:41.482 --> 15:42.734
see you again.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.652
So, you too, yeah.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.652
What brings you by?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.987
Well, listen, we're

15:44.694 --> 15:46.987
here... uh, we're

15:44.694 --> 15:46.987
going to do a session

15:47.029 --> 15:48.656
at, uh, at Sun

15:48.698 --> 15:51.075
and I just need

15:48.698 --> 15:51.075
a couple of my...

15:48.698 --> 15:51.075
my signature models

15:51.117 --> 15:54.036
for the...

15:51.117 --> 15:54.036
Yeah, well, we haven't

15:51.117 --> 15:54.036
run any off lately,

15:54.078 --> 15:56.539
Oh.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.539
and that

15:54.078 --> 15:56.539
particular model,

15:56.581 --> 15:59.041
we're out of stock of

15:56.581 --> 15:59.041
at the moment.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.377
Oh.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.377
Bubbles:

15:59.083 --> 16:01.377
Okay, well, that's...

16:01.419 --> 16:02.754
you know what?

16:01.419 --> 16:02.754
That's not a big deal.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.130
There's a nice

16:02.796 --> 16:04.130
one here.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.673
Any of these

16:04.171 --> 16:05.673
really would...

16:04.171 --> 16:05.673
Yeah,

16:05.715 --> 16:07.634
maybe we could

16:05.715 --> 16:07.634
just grab something

16:05.715 --> 16:07.634
here from the...

16:07.675 --> 16:09.803
Yeah, actually,

16:07.675 --> 16:09.803
I really can't

16:07.675 --> 16:09.803
let anything go

16:07.675 --> 16:09.803
at this time.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.512
Really.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.512
There's a lot of

16:09.844 --> 16:11.512
them here, though.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.139
Ricky: (Coughing)

16:11.554 --> 16:13.139
Dick.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.015
Walter, come on,

16:13.180 --> 16:15.015
can you help me

16:13.180 --> 16:15.015
out here please?

16:15.057 --> 16:16.893
Alex, Alex, look.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.312
I love you, man.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.312
You know that, okay?

16:19.353 --> 16:20.647
But I can't

16:19.353 --> 16:20.647
just continually

16:20.688 --> 16:22.189
keep letting

16:20.688 --> 16:22.189
these guitars

16:22.231 --> 16:23.942
go out the door

16:22.231 --> 16:23.942
for free. You

16:22.231 --> 16:23.942
know how it is.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.027
Yeah, but I mean,

16:23.983 --> 16:27.027
how many guitars do

16:23.983 --> 16:27.027
I sell for you guys?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.947
Alex, when

16:27.069 --> 16:28.947
we did the deal,

16:28.988 --> 16:32.074
the contract was

16:28.988 --> 16:32.074
for 20 guitars, which

16:28.988 --> 16:32.074
you got, correct?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.747
And since then,

16:34.869 --> 16:37.747
we've given you...

16:37.789 --> 16:41.000
how many?

16:37.789 --> 16:41.000
47 more.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.377
Yeah, but how

16:41.041 --> 16:43.377
many have I sold?

16:43.419 --> 16:46.798
Sixty.... five?

16:43.419 --> 16:46.798
Look, we've got

16:43.419 --> 16:46.798
this all documented.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.382
I understand what

16:46.840 --> 16:48.382
you're saying, okay?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.259
But here's the deal:

16:50.301 --> 16:52.762
we can't continue

16:50.301 --> 16:52.762
to keep giving you

16:50.301 --> 16:52.762
these guitars.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.973
And on top of that,

16:52.804 --> 16:54.973
I've got to be

16:52.804 --> 16:54.973
honest with you,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.057
we've been hearing

16:55.014 --> 16:57.057
stories that down

16:55.014 --> 16:57.057
on Beale Street,

16:57.099 --> 16:58.893
you've been selling

16:57.099 --> 16:58.893
these things.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.893
Oh, that's crazy!

16:58.935 --> 17:00.728
It's on YouTube,

16:58.935 --> 17:00.728
Alex!

17:00.770 --> 17:03.272
Oh, who watches YouTube?

17:00.770 --> 17:03.272
I mean, really.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.566
Listen, I had two

17:03.314 --> 17:05.566
guitars that I sold,

17:05.608 --> 17:07.652
but... the money

17:05.608 --> 17:07.652
went to a... what

17:05.608 --> 17:07.652
do you call it?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.780
An orphanage with nuns

17:07.694 --> 17:10.780
and kids in a bus...

17:07.694 --> 17:10.780
Alex, please,

17:10.822 --> 17:13.950
please don't do this

17:10.822 --> 17:13.950
to me, all right?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.910
I understand...

17:13.992 --> 17:15.910
(Sobbing)

17:13.992 --> 17:15.910
Walter, please.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.537
Wal... Please!

17:15.952 --> 17:17.537
It's going to

17:15.952 --> 17:17.537
be all right.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.414
Please, Walter,

17:17.578 --> 17:20.414
please help me out.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.414
Guys, guys...

17:20.456 --> 17:23.292
Ohhh, forget it!

17:20.456 --> 17:23.292
I'm sorry, brother.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.461
I can't help you out,

17:23.334 --> 17:25.461
I can't help you out.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.461
Ahh, forget it!

17:25.503 --> 17:27.129
Alex, it's okay.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.756
Guys, I'm sorry I can't

17:27.171 --> 17:28.756
help you out today.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.800
Please, just...

17:28.798 --> 17:30.800
Ricky:

17:28.798 --> 17:30.800
It's all good.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.760
I'm sorry he's so

17:30.842 --> 17:32.760
fucked in the head!

17:30.842 --> 17:32.760
He's got to understand.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.470
This is something

17:32.802 --> 17:34.470
you all didn't

17:32.802 --> 17:34.470
probably know about.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.263
We'll work it out.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.263
We'll get it later, okay?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.932
We've been doing

17:36.305 --> 17:37.932
business for

17:36.305 --> 17:37.932
years together.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.308
Guys, you all

17:37.974 --> 17:39.308
enjoy Memphis.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.561
I appreciate y'all.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.561
Bubbles:

17:39.350 --> 17:41.561
Okay.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.187
Julian:

17:41.602 --> 17:43.187
What the fuck's

17:41.602 --> 17:43.187
going on here?

17:41.602 --> 17:43.187
Fuck's sakes.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.939
What did I tell you

17:43.229 --> 17:44.939
about this, okay?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.939
Sorry.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.734
Bubbles:

17:44.981 --> 17:47.734
That was fucking

17:44.981 --> 17:47.734
bullshit.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.193
Bullshit!

17:49.235 --> 17:52.238
Alex: (Crying)

17:49.235 --> 17:52.238
I'm such a loser.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.615
A loser, loser, loser!

17:54.657 --> 17:56.075
The biggest loser!

17:56.116 --> 17:57.660
Al, come on,

17:56.116 --> 17:57.660
man.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.660
Come on.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.620
Come on.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.620
What are you

17:57.702 --> 17:59.620
talking about?

17:59.662 --> 18:01.664
You're one of the

17:59.662 --> 18:01.664
greatest guitar players

17:59.662 --> 18:01.664
that ever lived.

18:01.706 --> 18:02.957
They should give you

18:01.706 --> 18:02.957
anything you want.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.417
This is bullshit.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.502
Did they give

18:04.458 --> 18:06.502
you anything?

18:06.544 --> 18:08.713
No, he told us...

18:06.544 --> 18:08.713
Ah, fuck.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.091
So tell me something,

18:10.381 --> 18:12.091
man, how much were

18:10.381 --> 18:12.091
you getting

18:12.132 --> 18:14.761
for those guitars

18:12.132 --> 18:14.761
you were selling?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.763
Well, they list

18:14.802 --> 18:16.763
for six.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.514
I was getting three.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.766
Uh, four if I signed it.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.267
300 or 400 for

18:19.807 --> 18:21.267
a fucking guitar?

18:21.308 --> 18:22.560
What's it made

18:21.308 --> 18:22.560
out of, silver?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.353
Hundred?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.353
Thousand.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.480
It's my signature model.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.480
Signature model.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.025
Are you fucking

18:26.522 --> 18:29.025
kidding me?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.235
Boys, what do you got

18:29.067 --> 18:31.235
that look on for?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.240
Bubbles:

18:34.864 --> 18:36.240
(Panting)

18:36.282 --> 18:38.076
Ricky:

18:36.282 --> 18:38.076
Okay, nobody fucking panic,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.160
we're not here to

18:38.117 --> 18:40.160
hurt anybody. We just

18:38.117 --> 18:40.160
want a few guitars.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.662
There's thousands

18:40.202 --> 18:41.662
of the fucking

18:40.202 --> 18:41.662
things here,

18:41.704 --> 18:43.163
so this is not

18:41.704 --> 18:43.163
a big deal.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.916
Where the fuck are

18:43.205 --> 18:44.916
the Alex Lifeson models?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.751
Bubbles:

18:44.958 --> 18:46.751
Ricky, I got one!

18:44.958 --> 18:46.751
I got one.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.878
We only need one.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.878
Let's go, boys.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.171
We don't need

18:48.920 --> 18:51.171
all the guitars.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.049
Thank you. Get the

18:51.213 --> 18:53.049
fuck out of the way!

18:53.091 --> 18:55.134
Hey, dummy. Do you not see

18:53.091 --> 18:55.134
what the fuck's going on?

18:55.175 --> 18:57.011
Get the fuck out

18:55.175 --> 18:57.011
of the way, you...

18:57.053 --> 18:58.471
Julian:

18:57.053 --> 18:58.471
Get the fuck up, Ricky.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.014
Bubbles:

18:58.512 --> 19:00.014
I can't believe

18:58.512 --> 19:00.014
we just did this.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.682
Ricky:

19:00.056 --> 19:01.682
That was your fucking fault.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.682
(Thump)

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
Bubbles:

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
Sorry about this, Alex.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
Ricky: Get this shit

19:03.517 --> 19:05.352
out of here.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.352
Alex: Are you kidding?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.352
This is amazing!

19:05.394 --> 19:07.313
I feel alive for the

19:05.394 --> 19:07.313
first time in years.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.983
Oh, my God, stealing

19:07.354 --> 19:09.983
is so much fun!

19:07.354 --> 19:09.983
I never thought!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.734
I know!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.734
(Indistinct)

19:11.776 --> 19:13.152
Julian:

19:11.776 --> 19:13.152
Let's go, let's go!

19:11.776 --> 19:13.152
Bubbles: Fuck!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.280
Bubbles:

19:14.654 --> 19:16.280
Jesus, Ricky!

19:16.322 --> 19:17.782
Alex:

19:16.322 --> 19:17.782
Should we go get more?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.909
Bubbles:

19:17.824 --> 19:19.909
No, fuck! Let's just

19:17.824 --> 19:19.909
get out of here!

19:19.951 --> 19:21.995
Alex:

19:19.951 --> 19:21.995
All right, all right.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.995
Here, Ricky, load it up.

19:22.036 --> 19:25.039
C'mon, fuck, boys.

19:22.036 --> 19:25.039
Fucking relax, Bubs.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.125
Bubbles:

19:25.081 --> 19:27.125
Relax? What do

19:25.081 --> 19:27.125
you mean relax?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.417
We got you the fucking

19:27.166 --> 19:28.417
guitar, didn't we?

19:28.459 --> 19:30.044
(Engine ignition)

19:30.086 --> 19:31.253
All aboard!

19:33.506 --> 19:34.715
Julian:

19:33.506 --> 19:34.715
Hurry up, Ricky!

19:34.757 --> 19:36.801
Fuck! All right, go, go, go!

19:41.180 --> 19:43.516
Fuck, boys, I'm freaking

19:41.180 --> 19:43.516
out. I can't believe it.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.767
That's it,

19:43.557 --> 19:44.767
right there.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.519
Elvis, Jerry Lee,

19:46.560 --> 19:48.604
Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins...

19:48.646 --> 19:51.024
Alex:

19:48.646 --> 19:51.024
It's the real deal, Bubbles.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.024
Are you ready for this?

19:51.065 --> 19:52.859
Oh, I'm ready, Alex.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.986
I've never been so

19:52.900 --> 19:54.986
ready for anything

19:52.900 --> 19:54.986
in my whole life.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.864
All right, I'm going

19:55.028 --> 19:57.864
to go in and I'm

19:55.028 --> 19:57.864
going to do this.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.949
Get set.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.949
Yes, thank you, Alex.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.493
Right on,

19:59.991 --> 20:02.493
thank you.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.704
Ricky: Holy fuck, man!

20:02.535 --> 20:04.704
Julian:

20:02.535 --> 20:04.704
How you feeling, man?

20:04.745 --> 20:06.873
(Voice breaking)

20:04.745 --> 20:06.873
How do you think

20:04.745 --> 20:06.873
I'm feeling, boys?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.833
I'm losing my mind.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.833
I'm glad we were able

20:08.875 --> 20:11.293
to help make this

20:08.875 --> 20:11.293
happen for you, buddy.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.629
Boys, when people talk

20:11.335 --> 20:13.629
about Sun in the future,

20:13.671 --> 20:14.881
they're going

20:13.671 --> 20:14.881
to say, "Yeah,

20:14.922 --> 20:16.132
"Elvis was there, sure,

20:16.174 --> 20:18.176
but so was Bubbles."

20:16.174 --> 20:18.176
I hope so.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.344
That's what people

20:18.217 --> 20:20.344
are going to say.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.344
Hopefully you

20:18.217 --> 20:20.344
don't fuck this up.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.304
Julian:

20:20.386 --> 20:22.304
Don't fuck it up, okay?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.390
Ready?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.390
Uh, problems.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.060
Problems?

20:24.431 --> 20:27.060
There's a problem.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.060
They're booked.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.562
They're booked?

20:27.101 --> 20:29.562
What do you... Oh no.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.064
How long are

20:29.603 --> 20:31.064
they booked for?

20:31.105 --> 20:33.315
We can come back later.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.315
They weren't clear,

20:33.357 --> 20:35.109
but I think they said

20:33.357 --> 20:35.109
around three years.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.697
My God, three years!

20:36.819 --> 20:39.697
I thought you

20:36.819 --> 20:39.697
were famous.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.909
Boys, I'm not going to

20:39.739 --> 20:42.909
get to record at Sun!

20:39.739 --> 20:42.909
(Sobbing)

20:42.950 --> 20:45.036
They didn't have

20:42.950 --> 20:45.036
a fucking clue who

20:42.950 --> 20:45.036
you were, did they?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.371
Huh?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.371
No, Julian,

20:45.078 --> 20:47.371
they didn't.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.371
Jesus Christ, Al!

20:47.413 --> 20:49.832
You got him all

20:47.413 --> 20:49.832
fucking fired up now.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.084
Figure this shit out

20:51.125 --> 20:52.334
or he's going to

20:51.125 --> 20:52.334
whine about this

20:52.376 --> 20:54.712
for the rest of

20:52.376 --> 20:54.712
his life, man.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.297
Bubbles, Bubbles, sorry,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.297
man. I'm so sorry.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.299
Look, I know

20:57.339 --> 20:59.299
another studio.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.177
This place is dead

20:59.341 --> 21:01.177
cool for sure,

21:01.219 --> 21:03.303
but this other studio

21:01.219 --> 21:03.303
is really super cool.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.598
Cooler than Sun?

21:03.345 --> 21:05.598
Way cooler than Sun.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.183
And they know

21:05.639 --> 21:07.183
who you are?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.183
They do.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.144
My God,

21:08.809 --> 21:10.144
what's it called?

21:12.563 --> 21:14.857
Moon Studios? I've never

21:12.563 --> 21:14.857
heard of this place.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.109
Seriously?

21:16.150 --> 21:17.735
This place has been

21:16.150 --> 21:17.735
around forever.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.528
In fact, the guys

21:17.777 --> 21:19.528
from Sun

21:19.570 --> 21:20.780
got their name

21:19.570 --> 21:20.780
from this place.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.489
Really?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.489
Yeah.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.492
Did, like, Elvis

21:22.531 --> 21:25.492
or Jerry Lee ever

21:22.531 --> 21:25.492
record here?

21:25.534 --> 21:27.578
Not 100% sure

21:25.534 --> 21:27.578
about that,

21:27.620 --> 21:29.705
but I know for

21:27.620 --> 21:29.705
a fact that the guy

21:29.747 --> 21:31.958
who had a locker

21:29.747 --> 21:31.958
next to Elvis Presley

21:29.747 --> 21:31.958
in high school

21:31.999 --> 21:34.293
was a janitor here

21:31.999 --> 21:34.293
in the '70s.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.545
For real.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.545
Decent!

21:36.587 --> 21:39.632
Big fucking deal.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.632
Decent. Look,

21:36.587 --> 21:39.632
a piano step.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.177
Holy fuck, boys. Ahhh!

21:43.219 --> 21:45.179
It doesn't work,

21:43.219 --> 21:45.179
though.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.889
It's painted, Ricky.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.437
Okay, Alex, look,

21:50.643 --> 21:53.437
I got this plugged in

21:53.479 --> 21:55.397
and is that where

21:53.479 --> 21:55.397
the knob should be,

21:53.479 --> 21:55.397
do you think,

21:55.439 --> 21:57.483
for a cool

21:55.439 --> 21:57.483
country sound?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.818
Yep, that's perfect.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.444
Decent! Decent.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.196
Okay. This is going

22:00.486 --> 22:02.196
to be awesome, boys.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.697
We got the drums,

22:03.739 --> 22:04.949
bass,

22:04.991 --> 22:06.742
rhythm guitar...

22:06.784 --> 22:08.327
Don't really have

22:06.784 --> 22:08.327
a lead guitar,

22:08.368 --> 22:10.704
but I guess that's

22:08.368 --> 22:10.704
not a big deal.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.665
I could probably

22:10.746 --> 22:12.665
figure that...

22:12.706 --> 22:15.501
Oh, my God! I just

22:12.706 --> 22:15.501
had a idea, right now.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.963
What if you played

22:15.542 --> 22:18.963
lead on the song?

22:19.005 --> 22:20.256
You think you'd ever...

22:20.298 --> 22:22.008
consider doing that?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.177
I'd do that for you.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.177
Like old times.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.470
Sure, I'd do that.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.470
Really?

22:24.218 --> 22:26.470
Sure.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.265
I'd just need, uh,

22:26.512 --> 22:29.265
half the publishing,

22:29.307 --> 22:30.766
if that's okay

22:29.307 --> 22:30.766
with you.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.019
Publishing, yeah.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.019
What's publishing?

22:34.352 --> 22:37.315
Uhh... it's something

22:34.352 --> 22:37.315
I'm going to need

22:34.352 --> 22:37.315
three quarters of,

22:37.397 --> 22:39.025
plus the mechanicals.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.901
It's typical,

22:39.066 --> 22:40.901
it's typical.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.569
Well, there you go.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.571
Typical it is.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.571
Thank you.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.490
Let's shake on it.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.490
We shook, right?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.490
We shook.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.366
Okay.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.366
This is going

22:46.532 --> 22:48.366
to be awesome.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.161
Holy fuck,

22:48.408 --> 22:50.161
I'm just shaking.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.454
Okay, boys, this is

22:50.203 --> 22:52.454
just kind of like a...

22:52.496 --> 22:56.000
kind of like a fast

22:52.496 --> 22:56.000
blues song in E.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.543
Kind of, you know...

22:56.042 --> 22:57.543
You guys will know it.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.254
You guys are

22:57.584 --> 23:00.254
fucking pros. Okay.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.589
(Whispering)

23:00.296 --> 23:02.589
Boys, this is fucking crazy.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.258
This is crazy.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.844
These were actually

23:04.300 --> 23:06.844
hand-built and

23:04.300 --> 23:06.844
hand-autographed

23:06.886 --> 23:08.386
by Alex himself.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.386
Autograph right

23:06.886 --> 23:08.386
there, man.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.889
They're worth

23:08.428 --> 23:09.889
probably 60 grand,

23:09.930 --> 23:12.225
but we'll...

23:09.930 --> 23:12.225
like 700 bucks each.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.977
Since you're from

23:12.266 --> 23:14.977
EZ Top, we'll do to

23:12.266 --> 23:14.977
2 for 600, maybe.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.562
No, we're not going

23:15.019 --> 23:16.562
to do 2 for 600.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.147
How much you got

23:16.603 --> 23:18.147
there, 1,500?

23:18.189 --> 23:20.066
1,500 for 2,

23:18.189 --> 23:20.066
let's go.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.066
Right on.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.066
You...

23:20.107 --> 23:22.276
You did good, man.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.276
You did good.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.820
Okay, boys,

23:22.318 --> 23:24.820
I'm very excited.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.113
Thanks for doing this.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.405
This is

23:26.155 --> 23:27.405
"Who's Got Yer Belly?"

23:27.447 --> 23:29.116
Take one.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.116
(Laughs)

23:29.158 --> 23:31.244
You start her off.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.787
( â™ª )

23:46.967 --> 23:48.552
â™ª Well, the word

23:46.967 --> 23:48.552
on the street â™ª

23:48.594 --> 23:50.470
â™ª I heard somebody say â™ª

23:50.512 --> 23:53.473
â™ª Is you had a real

23:50.512 --> 23:53.473
shit turd of a day â™ª

23:53.515 --> 23:56.518
â™ª So I looked in my pocket

23:53.515 --> 23:56.518
and guess what I found â™ª

23:56.560 --> 23:59.772
â™ª Ten digits just waitin'

23:56.560 --> 23:59.772
there to take you to town â™ª

23:59.813 --> 24:03.025
â™ª I got a five-finger discount

23:59.813 --> 24:03.025
coming your way â™ª

24:03.067 --> 24:06.237
â™ª I'm a fingerball wizard,

24:03.067 --> 24:06.237
I just give it away â™ª

24:06.279 --> 24:08.114
â™ª You're lookin'

24:06.279 --> 24:08.114
for some bellywork â™ª

24:08.155 --> 24:09.656
â™ª Well, don't be alarmed â™ª

24:09.698 --> 24:11.117
â™ª I've got

24:09.698 --> 24:11.117
the friggin' tools â™ª

24:11.158 --> 24:13.119
â™ª On the end of my arm â™ª

24:13.160 --> 24:14.578
â™ª If you're feelin' low â™ª

24:14.620 --> 24:16.538
â™ª I'll put my peanut

24:14.620 --> 24:16.538
in your jelly â™ª

24:16.580 --> 24:19.333
â™ª No one's got yer back,

24:16.580 --> 24:19.333
but who's got yer belly? â™ª

24:19.375 --> 24:20.458
â™ª Uhhh â™ª

24:20.500 --> 24:22.711
( â™ª )

24:25.672 --> 24:29.093
â™ª Well, people got milk

24:25.672 --> 24:29.093
and people got game â™ª

24:29.135 --> 24:32.221
â™ª They're both refreshing,

24:29.135 --> 24:32.221
but they're not the same â™ª

24:32.263 --> 24:35.515
â™ª When my baby gets my belly,

24:32.263 --> 24:35.515
she sets me on fire â™ª

24:35.557 --> 24:37.226
â™ª If the ride

24:35.557 --> 24:37.226
is feelin' hard â™ª

24:37.268 --> 24:38.978
â™ª It's 'cause

24:37.268 --> 24:38.978
there's air in my tire â™ª

24:39.019 --> 24:40.854
â™ª When I get yer belly,

24:39.019 --> 24:40.854
it's to... â™ª

24:40.896 --> 24:43.441
( â™ª )

24:43.481 --> 24:45.985
Jesus Murphy.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.362
â™ª ...for bellywork

24:46.026 --> 24:48.362
well, don't be alarmed â™ª

24:48.404 --> 24:51.949
â™ª I got the friggin' tools

24:48.404 --> 24:51.949
on the end of my arm â™ª

24:51.991 --> 24:53.700
â™ª The hockey game's

24:51.991 --> 24:53.700
in overtime â™ª

24:53.742 --> 24:55.577
â™ª And someone

24:53.742 --> 24:55.577
broke the telly â™ª

24:55.619 --> 24:58.331
â™ª No one's got your back,

24:55.619 --> 24:58.331
but who's got yer belly? â™ª

24:58.372 --> 24:59.623
â™ª Uh-huh â™ª

24:59.665 --> 25:00.916
( â™ª )

25:00.958 --> 25:02.168
Take it, Alex!

25:02.209 --> 25:04.753
(Guitar solo)

25:04.795 --> 25:07.798
( â™ª )

25:19.810 --> 25:22.021
( â™ª )

25:32.156 --> 25:34.241
Bubbles:

25:32.156 --> 25:34.241
I can't fucking believe

25:32.156 --> 25:34.241
today turned out like this!

25:34.283 --> 25:35.951
At one point,

25:34.283 --> 25:35.951
I thought it was fucked

25:35.993 --> 25:38.745
and then I end up with maybe

25:35.993 --> 25:38.745
the greatest guitar player

25:38.787 --> 25:42.124
of all time, playing

25:38.787 --> 25:42.124
a solo on my song.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.583
(Laughing)

25:43.625 --> 25:44.793
â™ª No one's got your back â™ª

25:44.835 --> 25:46.628
â™ª But who's got your belly? â™ª

25:46.670 --> 25:48.088
â™ª You might be good

25:46.670 --> 25:48.088
at grammar â™ª

25:48.130 --> 25:49.923
â™ª But you're terrible

25:48.130 --> 25:49.923
at spelly â™ª

25:49.965 --> 25:52.718
â™ª No one's got yer back,

25:49.965 --> 25:52.718
but... â™ª

25:52.759 --> 25:55.054
â™ª Who's got yer belly? â™ª

25:55.095 --> 25:56.514
â™ª Come on â™ª

25:56.554 --> 25:58.391
â™ª Yee-aah! â™ª

25:58.432 --> 25:59.641
Yeah-h!

25:59.683 --> 26:03.812
( â™ª )

26:03.854 --> 26:07.233
Bubbles:

26:03.854 --> 26:07.233
Check my resume,

26:03.854 --> 26:07.233
you know I got this.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.026
(Last note)

26:09.068 --> 26:12.154
Decent! Holy fuck!

26:12.196 --> 26:13.655
That was good.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.655
Bubbles:

26:12.196 --> 26:13.655
Boys, did you hear that?

26:13.697 --> 26:15.324
You fucking

26:13.697 --> 26:15.324
nailed it, buddy!

26:15.366 --> 26:18.618
That sounded just

26:15.366 --> 26:18.618
like a real song!

26:18.660 --> 26:20.329
Like a real song!

26:18.660 --> 26:20.329
It did.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.248
Alex, my bird's

26:20.371 --> 26:22.248
doing that.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.581
Is that normal?

26:23.623 --> 26:25.292
If it's lying on

26:23.623 --> 26:25.292
your belly, it is.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.836
(Laughs)

26:25.334 --> 26:27.836
It's got my belly.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.838
Alex:

26:27.878 --> 26:29.838
Well, Bubbles,

26:27.878 --> 26:29.838
I'm going to get going.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.048
Okay. Listen,

26:31.090 --> 26:32.716
I just want to

26:31.090 --> 26:32.716
thank you so much.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.676
Thank you for

26:32.758 --> 26:34.676
playing on that song

26:34.718 --> 26:36.095
and just everything

26:34.718 --> 26:36.095
you did.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.847
No, no, you don't

26:36.136 --> 26:38.847
have to thank me.

26:38.889 --> 26:41.559
This is probably the best

26:38.889 --> 26:41.559
day of my entire life.

26:41.599 --> 26:44.353
What?

26:41.599 --> 26:44.353
I did so much,

26:41.599 --> 26:44.353
I feel alive again.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.188
I'm going to go back to work,

26:46.230 --> 26:48.399
and become

26:46.230 --> 26:48.399
who I once was.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.317
Decent!

26:48.441 --> 26:50.317
I guess you made up

26:50.359 --> 26:51.651
for being a dick

26:50.359 --> 26:51.651
earlier, man.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.279
Yeah, sorry

26:51.693 --> 26:53.279
about that.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.279
No problem.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.947
I mean, I know

26:53.320 --> 26:54.947
we've had our

26:53.320 --> 26:54.947
difference and stuff,

26:54.988 --> 26:57.491
me and you, but

26:54.988 --> 26:57.491
can we just let

26:54.988 --> 26:57.491
pylons be pylons?

26:57.533 --> 26:59.910
Yeah, you got it.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.910
All right, awesome.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.745
Today was awesome,

26:59.952 --> 27:01.745
thank you.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.745
Yeah.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.290
And I was going to,

27:01.787 --> 27:04.290
you know, take this.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.583
I found it in the

27:04.331 --> 27:05.583
backseat of your car.

27:05.623 --> 27:06.959
Julian!

27:05.623 --> 27:06.959
Oh, my God!

27:07.000 --> 27:08.586
I think it's yours, man.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.586
Yeah, my wallet!

27:08.626 --> 27:09.920
I was looking

27:08.626 --> 27:09.920
for this!

27:09.962 --> 27:11.213
Julian:

27:09.962 --> 27:11.213
Hey, no problem.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.924
Oh... this is

27:11.255 --> 27:13.924
the money clip.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.218
Yeah, I had to... I

27:13.966 --> 27:16.218
had to get some booze,

27:16.260 --> 27:18.095
so I'll get you

27:16.260 --> 27:18.095
back later.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.055
Never mind,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.055
it's worth it.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.557
Bubbles:

27:20.097 --> 27:21.557
Sorry about that Alex,

27:20.097 --> 27:21.557
sorry about that.

27:21.599 --> 27:22.975
It's worth it, guys,

27:21.599 --> 27:22.975
it's worth it to me.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.102
Take care. See you

27:23.016 --> 27:25.102
again soon, all right?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.895
Okay, thank you.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.895
Yeah, see you.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.565
Julian,

27:26.937 --> 27:29.565
for fuck's sakes.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.565
What?

27:29.607 --> 27:32.109
What?

27:29.607 --> 27:32.109
You're lucky you

27:29.607 --> 27:32.109
gave him that back.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.569
I'd be fucking

27:32.151 --> 27:33.569
livid right now.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.112
Well, you know,

27:33.611 --> 27:35.112
I still got that,

27:33.611 --> 27:35.112
but...

27:35.154 --> 27:36.530
you know, we've

27:35.154 --> 27:36.530
got to get home.
