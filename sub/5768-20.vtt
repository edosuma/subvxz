WEBVTT

00:02.830 --> 00:04.764
(clicking)

00:30.330 --> 00:31.752
It was a party.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.428
A... senior class party.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.291
At Todd's place.

00:35.330 --> 00:37.764
WILL:
And you went with some friends?

00:37.800 --> 00:39.336
Yes.

00:39.370 --> 00:40.632
Gina and Becky.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.160
And you said this was
at Todd's house.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.802
You mean the defendant,
Todd Bratcher?

00:45.210 --> 00:46.768
Yes.
Now before we go further,

00:46.810 --> 00:48.835
Rainey, there might be
a question as to why

00:48.880 --> 00:51.576
this is taking place in a civil
court and not a criminal court.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.339
A rape would seem to be
a criminal matter...

00:53.380 --> 00:54.608
Objection, Your Honor.

00:54.650 --> 00:56.117
Counselor is testifying.

00:56.150 --> 00:57.412
Sustained.
Thank you.

00:57.450 --> 00:58.519
WIL_L:
So, Rainey,

00:58.550 --> 01:00.518
why are you suing your rapist?
Uh...

01:00.560 --> 01:02.551
Your accused rapist?

01:02.590 --> 01:04.558
He's not in jail.

01:04.590 --> 01:08.356
He raped me and got a plea
bargain with the prosecution,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.664
so he's going to Princeton,

01:10.700 --> 01:12.190
not prison.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.537
I don't think
he should get off scot-free.

01:13.570 --> 01:17.666
So the money, the amount
you're suing him for?

01:17.710 --> 01:20.201
It's going
to Rape Victim Advocates.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.209
I... just want it
to cost him something.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.569
I don't want any...
PARKS:
Excuse me.

01:24.610 --> 01:27.317
I need to interrupt for
a minute here. Sheriff,

01:27.350 --> 01:29.511
please take the jury
into the holding room.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.189
Uh, sorry, Your Honor,
I'm not sure...

01:32.220 --> 01:33.448
Mr. Gardner, please

01:33.490 --> 01:35.708
wait for the jury to be removed.

01:40.930 --> 01:44.263
I just received a copy
of this tweet a minute ago,

01:44.300 --> 01:46.564
_ "I don't care _ _
If they put me In jail.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.160
Todd Bratcher
raped me."

01:49.210 --> 01:51.599
At the beginning of
this trial, I insisted

01:51.640 --> 01:53.301
on one thing:

01:53.340 --> 01:55.774
not trying this case
in the press.

01:55.810 --> 01:59.371
I put a gag order in place
for exactly that reason.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.479
And now... there's this.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.919
So I must ask you,
Ms. Selwin...

02:02.950 --> 02:05.316
Your Honor, please let me
speak to my client...
Don't you want to hear

02:05.350 --> 02:07.580
my question first?
I do. I'm sorry.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.326
Did you write this tweet?

02:09.360 --> 02:12.329
Your Honor, I must insist on my
client's Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.521
No. I...

02:14.560 --> 02:15.652
(quietly):
It would be better if you

02:15.700 --> 02:17.190
insist on your right

02:17.230 --> 02:19.391
or that your sister
posted this for you.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.329
Mr. Gardner, I did...
He'll hold you in contempt.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.702
If he holds you
in contempt...

02:24.740 --> 02:26.276
he wins.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.574
PARKS:
Excuse me. I asked a
very simple question.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.602
Your Honor, Rainey insists
on her Fifth Amendment right.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.741
Todd Bratcher raped me,
so I wrote that.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.451
Then I must hold you
in contempt.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.856
Sheriff, please take
the witness into custody.

02:42.890 --> 02:44.881
Your Honor, my client
is 18 years old. Young people

02:44.930 --> 02:46.693
don't see tweeting
as publicizing.

02:46.730 --> 02:48.493
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

02:48.530 --> 02:51.624
This court
is adjourned.
(bangs gavel)

02:51.670 --> 02:52.967
WILL:
Hey, Alicia. Where are you?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.638
Lunch with Dylan Stack.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.831
Oh, Mr. Bitcoin.
Yeah, what's he want?

02:56.870 --> 02:58.235
I don't know. Some class action.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.237
Rainey Selwin

02:59.280 --> 03:00.030
has been held in contempt.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.604
I need your help
with Judge Parks.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.642
You... What-what happened?

03:03.680 --> 03:04.840
The gag order, she broke it.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.745
Oh, no. That's awful.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.611
I know. Can you be here at 2:00?

03:08.650 --> 03:10.948
Yes, sure. I'll-I'll head
right over after this.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.617
I'm so sorry.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.582
Okay. Thanks.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.521
STACK:
Something go wrong?

03:17.560 --> 03:18.925
No,

03:18.960 --> 03:21.292
just a client
who's idealistic.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.365
Is that a bad thing?

03:22.400 --> 03:24.561
No, it just
complicates things.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.636
How does it complicate things?

03:26.670 --> 03:28.365
Reality isn't idealistic,

03:31.710 --> 03:33.007
only one gets hurt.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.803
Maybe it'll be reality
this time.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.273
Uh, my guess is not.

03:36.310 --> 03:38.278
So tell me
about this class action.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.447
No, no,

03:39.480 --> 03:40.674
that's not a segue.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.971
"Speaking of idealism..."

03:42.020 --> 03:43.544
Now, there's a segue.

03:43.590 --> 03:46.684
Do you know
who Aaron Swartz is?

03:46.720 --> 03:49.587
The computer
activist who died.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.427
The computer activist
who committed suicide

03:51.460 --> 03:54.429
after an unrelenting campaign
from federal prosecutors

03:54.460 --> 03:55.597
to imprison him.

03:55.630 --> 03:57.393
Of course.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.694
In his memory,
I am attempting

03:59.740 --> 04:01.594
to organize a class action

04:01.640 --> 04:03.562
against prosecutorial
overcharging.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.931
And you want us to join
this class action?

04:05.970 --> 04:07.369
Yes.

04:07.410 --> 04:08.502
I'll run it by my partners,

04:08.540 --> 04:11.668
but they're not always
into causes for causes' sake.

04:11.710 --> 04:12.972
They tend

04:13.020 --> 04:15.011
to want to see the...

04:16.720 --> 04:19.655
(whispers):
Would you stop doing that?

04:19.690 --> 04:20.657
What?

04:20.690 --> 04:21.816
Slapping your money around.

04:21.860 --> 04:22.986
Where do you get it, anyway?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.588
Work.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.052
Okay, put it away.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.626
Don't you worry

04:27.660 --> 04:29.628
that you're gonna get held up,
because when...

04:29.670 --> 04:31.661
when I...

04:31.700 --> 04:33.634
When you...

04:33.670 --> 04:35.535
Um...

04:35.570 --> 04:36.969
I will run it
by my partners.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.307
With your recommendation?

04:38.340 --> 04:39.568
With my recommendation.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.475
Um, do you mind?
I'll be right back.
Please.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.691
Your Honor, our client

05:03.730 --> 05:05.721
has never been in trouble
with the law before.

05:05.770 --> 05:07.658
She has no criminal record.
That's beside the point.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.736
She found out this morning
that her rapist

05:09.770 --> 05:11.761
was admitted to Princeton,
and she was angry.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.903
It has not been proved
that he is a rapist,

05:13.940 --> 05:14.975
and it isn't helping your cause

05:15.010 --> 05:16.898
that you keep insisting
on facts not in evidence.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.599
WILL:
We only want to
relate her passion

05:18.650 --> 05:19.969
and why this tweeting
won't happen again.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.669
Mrs. Florrick,
Mr. Gardner,

05:21.720 --> 05:23.642
if the defendant
had written a tweet

05:23.690 --> 05:25.043
insisting that Rainey was lying,

05:25.090 --> 05:27.786
I would be equally angry,
and he'd be behind bars.

05:27.820 --> 05:31.426
This gag order is, and
was, content neutral.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.451
But...

05:33.500 --> 05:34.819
get your client to apologize

05:34.860 --> 05:38.591
and promise not to tweet again,
and I'll release her.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.894
And the, uh, trial,
Your Honor?

05:40.940 --> 05:43.135
This will not impact the trial;
either way, we're going forward.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.434
(buzzer sounds)

05:47.680 --> 05:49.739
WILL:
I know, but there
is nothing wrong

05:49.780 --> 05:52.078
with apologizing
to the court.

05:52.110 --> 05:54.749
There is.
I'm sorry, but there is.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.814
(sniffling)

06:03.530 --> 06:06.829
Let's say that this goes
against me.

06:06.860 --> 06:07.656
We have a good case.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.669
But the prosecutors had
a good case,

06:10.700 --> 06:12.861
and Todd Bratcher is free.

06:12.900 --> 06:17.439
So let's say this goes
against me.

06:17.470 --> 06:21.873
Then what's out there is not
"Todd Bratcher is a rapist."

06:21.910 --> 06:23.878
What's out there is

06:23.910 --> 06:27.073
"I'm sorry for calling
Todd Bratcher a rapist."

06:27.120 --> 06:29.748
The gag order will only
last as long as the trial.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.417
Afterwards, you can
say anything you want.

06:31.450 --> 06:32.758
But it will still
be out there

06:32.790 --> 06:34.451
that I apologized

06:34.490 --> 06:36.958
for calling Todd Bratcher
a rapist.

06:36.990 --> 06:39.458
I'm sorry.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.491
I'm scared to be in here,

06:41.530 --> 06:45.728
but I-I can't live
with myself apologizing

06:45.770 --> 06:48.864
for saying something
that is true.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.446
Are you all right?

06:59.480 --> 07:03.018
I don't think I'd have
that... determination.

07:03.050 --> 07:05.985
(buzzer sounds)

07:07.990 --> 07:10.458
So we have to win this.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.957
MOODY:
Let me say first

07:11.990 --> 07:15.027
that the Florrick campaign
is still very enthusiastic

07:15.060 --> 07:18.769
about you filling the open seat
for Supreme Court justice,

07:18.800 --> 07:20.859
and with Florrick three points
ahead in the polls,

07:20.900 --> 07:22.959
we thought it best
to keep moving forward.

07:23.010 --> 07:26.207
Good.
I'm not sure about "still."

07:26.240 --> 07:27.798
Mr. Florrick
has asked me

07:27.840 --> 07:29.705
merely to look into some

07:29.750 --> 07:30.876
of the issues
in your background.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.845
Nothing should be read
into the questions.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.677
Okay?
Okay.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.144
Kurt McVeigh?

07:39.190 --> 07:41.909
Could you be more specific,
please?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.188
You've worked
with him?

07:43.230 --> 07:45.255
And he's
a ballistics expert

07:45.290 --> 07:47.599
and your occasional lover?

07:48.930 --> 07:50.158
Is that not the
correct word?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.839
It's the correct word,
but not the most subtle.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.098
My apologies.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.937
Vetting is
an unsubtle art.

07:55.970 --> 07:58.632
Mr. McVeigh holds
secessionist views?

07:58.670 --> 08:00.604
His views _
are not secessnonist.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.006
He has said he would not stand

08:03.050 --> 08:04.938
in the way of those
who would secede.

08:04.980 --> 08:07.869
I've heard my liberal friends

08:07.920 --> 08:09.012
express the same sentiment

08:09.050 --> 08:11.985
about, um, Texas seceding.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.851
Um, is there a problem
with Mr. McVeigh's views?

08:13.890 --> 08:14.982
Not at the moment.

08:15.020 --> 08:18.649
The campaign has red flags
due to his name, McVeigh.

08:18.690 --> 08:19.918
It can look bad.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.858
Even if it's not bad?

08:20.900 --> 08:23.994
It's just,
sometimes superficial things,

08:24.030 --> 08:26.999
like names,
can hurt a candidacy.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.258
For example,
having the middle name Hussein?

08:29.300 --> 08:32.064
It would be better
if we could argue

08:32.110 --> 08:34.908
that Mr. McVeigh
is a casual friend.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.305
Is that a better word?

08:36.340 --> 08:37.978
It is a better word,

08:38.010 --> 08:39.819
but it can't be argued that.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.772
Why can't it be argued that?

08:41.820 --> 08:42.889
We're getting married.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.715
Huh.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.853
I didn't catch that
In my vetting.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.721
Oh, neither did I.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.728
Yes, it, um, it just happened.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.251
Well, that might cause problems.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.824
I understand.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.724
Okay.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.590
Um, let me
take this back,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.528
and...

09:07.810 --> 09:10.973
(sighs)

09:11.010 --> 09:12.341
Congratulations.

09:12.380 --> 09:15.144
ALICIA:
Thanks for meeting me.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.989
Are you up for a stroll?

09:17.020 --> 09:19.989
This is very
cloak-and-dagger.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.352
Stroll it is.

09:22.390 --> 09:25.154
When we met at my
apartment, we...

09:25.190 --> 09:28.091
we talked about
leavmg together.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.961
Starting our own firm.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.797
Are you still thinking
of doing that?

09:31.830 --> 09:34.993
Am I still thinking
of leaving together? No.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.008
Are you thinking
of leaving at all?

09:37.040 --> 09:37.961
Starting your own firm?

09:38.010 --> 09:39.261
No.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.902
That would cause me
to get fired,

09:40.940 --> 09:41.907
so of course not.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.874
Cary,

09:43.910 --> 09:45.673
I saw you at Clovis Seafood.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.974
Meeting with the fourth years.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.184
So?

09:51.220 --> 09:53.654
I just want to know

09:53.690 --> 09:55.385
if you guys are
organizing something.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.059
We're meeting.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.250
We like each other.

09:59.290 --> 10:00.848
I didn't know that was wrong.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.924
It's not wrong, I'm just...

10:01.960 --> 10:03.063
Alicia.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.819
We're not plotting anything,
okay?

10:05.870 --> 10:08.088
Was I angry
when I lost my partnership?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.664
Yeah.
Were the other fourth years?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.666
Of course they were,
but do we trust

10:11.710 --> 10:13.371
you partners will eventually
make good on your commitments?

10:13.410 --> 10:14.968
Yes, we do.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.001
Okay?

10:19.010 --> 10:20.875
Okay.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.184
Do you need anything else
or can I get back to work now?

10:26.190 --> 10:28.181
(automatic gunfire,
glass shattering)

10:30.830 --> 10:32.718
GRACE:
Will we move
to Springfield?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.853
Huh?

10:34.900 --> 10:37.095
If Dad wins, do we have
to move to Springfield?

10:37.130 --> 10:39.997
Eli told me that
there's a lot of governors

10:40.040 --> 10:42.133
(phone chimes)
who work out
of Chicago, so...

10:42.170 --> 10:44.866
I don't think...

10:54.780 --> 10:55.917
(phone whooshes)

10:55.950 --> 10:57.941
You don't think?

11:05.030 --> 11:07.294
(keypad clicking)

11:11.800 --> 11:13.062
(whooshes)

11:21.510 --> 11:24.809
(whooshes)

11:27.250 --> 11:29.241
(whooshes)

11:45.030 --> 11:48.193
MAN (mockingly):
Hi, I'm Rainey.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.162
I'm on the gymnastics team.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.735
(men laughing, chattering
on video)

11:52.780 --> 11:54.930
(laughing):
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.504
Does that... does that hurt?
What is that?

11:56.540 --> 11:57.871
(laughter on phone)
I don't know.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.002
Where's it from?

11:59.050 --> 12:00.176
Hey.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.471
ALL:
Oh!

12:01.520 --> 12:03.442
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.446
(indistinct chatter)

12:05.490 --> 12:07.082
MAN:
I broke it.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.348
Oh, Rainey.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.255
(laughter, chattering)
Oh, oh, Rainey.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.155
ALICIA:
Hello! I'm home.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.158
(men chattering excitedly
on phone)

12:14.200 --> 12:15.758
What's wrong?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.165
(men laughing)
MAN: Oh, oh!

12:17.200 --> 12:18.861
(laughing):
Oh, it's so good.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.265
Oh!

12:20.300 --> 12:21.938
Let's see if this fits.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.039
Oh.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.334
Fit? Oh, it'll get
lost up there.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.803
Do it!
Oh!

12:26.840 --> 12:28.432
Oh, Rainey!

12:28.480 --> 12:30.471
(laughter)

12:44.230 --> 12:45.879
Let's see if this fits.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.558
Fit? Oh, it'll get
lost up there.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.919
You found this online?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.062
Where were you looking?

12:51.100 --> 12:52.567
No. No, Mom. It
just came to me.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.090
It popped up
on my screen.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.869
You don't know who sent this?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.003
_ No.
DId someone
at school--

12:57.040 --> 12:59.975
did-did someone know these kids?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.329
No, Mom. They're not even
from our district.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.529
I don't... I don't get it.

13:02.580 --> 13:06.346
Did you tell any of your friends
I was working on this case?

13:06.380 --> 13:08.018
Mom, no. It was sent
to me anonymously.

13:08.050 --> 13:10.314
They knew enough to route it
through something so I couldn't

13:10.350 --> 13:11.544
trace it.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.057
GRACE: Wait, you're
working on this case?

13:13.090 --> 13:14.284
Yes.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.287
Are you winning?

13:15.320 --> 13:16.355
No.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.278
So this is good.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.050
Let's see if this fits.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.398
Fit? Oh, it'll get
lost up there.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.567
No, they can't, Your Honor.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.192
It has nothing
to do with the crime.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.559
Your Honor, we have an affidavit
from Jesse Martin,

13:28.600 --> 13:29.999
one of the boys in the video,
authenticating...

13:30.040 --> 13:30.961
It doesn't matter.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.159
It's prejudicial.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.030
They never mention a rape.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.934
They mention and joke
about a hairbrush

13:35.980 --> 13:38.346
being inserted into
Rainey's vagina.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.018
No, a sex doll's.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.142
Uh, Mr. Gardner,
where did you get this?

13:41.180 --> 13:42.579
It was sent to my
house anonymously.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.383
Anonymously?
It was hacked

13:44.420 --> 13:45.580
from my client's
cell phone.
Oh, come on.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.951
He deleted this file,

13:46.990 --> 13:47.911
which is his right!

13:47.960 --> 13:49.109
He was embarrassed,

13:49.160 --> 13:51.185
as you or I would be,
by this awful joke.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.254
That's why
he deleted it.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.157
And that is why it can not
be presented in court.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.896
It was obtained
through Illegal means.

13:57.930 --> 14:00.194
Is that true, ma'am?
I have no idea.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.038
Then I have no alternative
but to exclude this.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.162
Your Honor, we have
authenticated...

14:04.210 --> 14:05.131
It doesn't matter.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.035
_ I cannot admi_t
Illegally-obtaIned eVIdence.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.105
WILL:
What's wrong now?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.505
DAVID: What else?
The fourth years.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.347
I was looking through
their billables.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.608
They're taking
their vacation days.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.612
All of them?
Yes. All five.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.117
It's more scare tactics.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.152
They want us to think
they're leaving.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.010
Well, I'm not offering
more partnerships.

14:22.060 --> 14:25.450
I say we split them up
by firing one of their asses.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.458
Which one?
We need all of them.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.058
Replace Cary.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.169
He was the last one hired.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.930
And as far as I'm concerned,
he was the ringleader.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.130
ALICIA:
I was the ringleader.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.432
DIANE:
So do you think

14:36.470 --> 14:37.937
these are more scare tactics,

14:37.970 --> 14:39.301
or are they really leaving?

14:39.340 --> 14:42.002
I think it's nothing,
a coincidence.

14:42.040 --> 14:42.938
Associates
don't take vacation days.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.005
ALICIA: It's been
an exhausting bankruptcy.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.143
Everybody needs their
vacation days to unwind.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.171
So they're over it? They're
not angry at us anymore?

14:51.220 --> 14:54.212
I talked to Cary yesterday, and
he told me that they're trusting

14:54.260 --> 14:56.182
the partners will live up
to their commitments.

14:59.030 --> 15:02.090
Okay, and I think
we've all guardedly

15:02.130 --> 15:03.961
approved of joining
this class action

15:04.000 --> 15:05.399
against prosecutorial
overcharging.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.091
ALICIA:
Robyn?

15:07.140 --> 15:08.459
Do you have a second?
Yeah.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.161
Oh, oh, hey,
sorry about my clothes.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.962
I just came from... I was...

15:12.010 --> 15:14.103
Actually, I didn't come
from anywhere. I like this.

15:14.140 --> 15:18.042
Okay. Um, I need to ask you
to do something... for me.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.445
Oh, is it about the review?

15:19.480 --> 15:21.072
The...? No.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.371
Oh, I-I'm being reviewed
this week.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.115
Just want to make sure I'm okay.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.617
You're okay.
Yeah?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.117
Good. Oh, I like working here.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.253
I'm glad. Uh, I want you
to look into something,

15:29.290 --> 15:31.349
but come back only to me,
not the partners.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.618
TODD:
The sad thing is,

15:32.660 --> 15:34.548
I like Rainey.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.124
I've always liked Rainey.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.661
ANDREWS:
And so,

15:37.700 --> 15:41.158
you have no idea
why she accused you of this?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.168
No.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.963
She got pretty drunk
at this party. We all did.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.331
Spring break, you know.
And all I can imagine

15:48.380 --> 15:51.178
is, she got unhappy with
her decision to hook up with me.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.245
Yeah, that's what
it must have been.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.271
PARKS: Mr. Gardner.
Do I even have to?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.140
No, Your Honor.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.182
ANDREWS: And, uh, this,
um, hooking up--

15:58.220 --> 15:59.710
it was consensual?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.058
TODD:
Absolutely.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.512
Did you know Rainey
before this party?

16:02.560 --> 16:05.120
We dated
last year.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.219
So Rainey was
your ex-girlfriend?

16:07.260 --> 16:09.399
Not exactly.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.227
Dylan, what a surprise.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.067
I wanted to see what
idealism looks like.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.068
Oh, really?
That's why you're here?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.567
Yes.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.966
Okay, good.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.675
Are you the friend?

16:23.710 --> 16:26.076
Am I the... friend?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.510
Are you the friend who texted
something to my son?

16:31.090 --> 16:33.217
No. 1-1 don't...

16:33.260 --> 16:34.682
know your son. Why?

16:34.720 --> 16:37.086
Someone texted something to him.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.256
Something that could help me.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.689
I'm sorry.
It wasn't me.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.592
He's a bastard.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.120
ALICIA:
Yes.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.296
STACK:
But does the
jury know that?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.137
I don't know.
PARKS:
Mr. Gardner.

16:49.170 --> 16:49.932
Good luck.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.403
WILL:
You did not take advantage

16:51.440 --> 16:53.806
of Rainey's
intoxicated state

16:53.840 --> 16:56.536
by having sex with her
while she was unconscious?

16:56.580 --> 16:58.241
Correct.
And you did not

16:58.280 --> 17:00.771
insert a hairbrush

17:00.820 --> 17:02.344
into her vagina?

17:02.380 --> 17:03.381
Of course not.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.318
And you never made

17:04.350 --> 17:06.784
fun of these claims
In her depOSItIon?

17:06.820 --> 17:08.458
No, never.
ANDREWS: Objection, Your Honor!

17:08.490 --> 17:10.287
The witness has
opened himself up...

17:10.330 --> 17:12.184
ANDREWS:
No, Your Honor.
WILL:
Yes, he has, Your Honor.

17:12.230 --> 17:15.290
PARKS (clears throat):
Everybody, up here.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.734
Your Honor, the defendant
has clearly made a claim

17:20.770 --> 17:22.795
that we are now
at lIberty to Impeach.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.398
This is prosecution by stunt.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.499
We must be allowed to use
the authenticated videotape.

17:26.540 --> 17:28.405
I already ruled on that.
Yes, but not
as a means

17:28.440 --> 17:29.737
to impeach.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.247
Mr. Bratcher said
he never made fun

17:31.280 --> 17:32.349
of Rainey's deposition.

17:32.380 --> 17:35.178
The only way he could have known
about the hairbrush

17:35.220 --> 17:36.312
is if he read it
in the deposition,

17:36.350 --> 17:37.385
or committed the rape.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.342
Either way, we must now
be allowed to impeach it.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.316
I agree.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.328
Your Honor,
it is prejudicial...

17:43.360 --> 17:45.123
But only that section
of the tape

17:45.160 --> 17:47.219
pertaining to
the impeachment.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.228
Now step back.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.564
Fit? It'll probably
get lost up there.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.702
We can't show more?

18:02.740 --> 18:05.174
Unfortunately, no.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.347
Just a few more issues.

18:06.380 --> 18:07.312
KALINDA:
So...

18:07.350 --> 18:09.238
we've moved past
Ms. Lockhart's relationship

18:09.280 --> 18:10.838
with Kurt McVeigh?
No.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.209
In fact, we need you

18:12.250 --> 18:13.751
to meet with
Chief Justice Ryvlan.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.280
To what purpose?
He brought

18:15.320 --> 18:17.322
Mr. McVeigh's views
to our attention.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.818
We need for you to comfort him
as to your views.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.794
You want me to
kIss the rIng?
Yes.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.627
With all due deference.
Well, good.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.796
I can do that.
One other thing.

18:25.830 --> 18:28.628
You represent Dylan Stack?

18:28.670 --> 18:30.501
Well, we at one time

18:30.540 --> 18:31.700
represented
Dylan Stack.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.776
But you no longer do?

18:33.810 --> 18:35.368
No.
That's odd,

18:35.410 --> 18:36.832
_ 'cause I_saw him
In your waItIng room.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.519
Well...
is that a problem?

18:41.550 --> 18:42.710
Yes.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.479
He advocates the overthrow
of government.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.748
Well, I think
that's incorrect.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.678
No. It's correct.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.188
And should be addressed.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.857
ROBYN:
Hey, uh, I can't talk
anylouden

18:51.890 --> 18:52.857
There are people here.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.323
But I found out something.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.396
That was fast.
Yes, I know. Um...

18:56.430 --> 18:57.795
I looked into
recent achISItIons

18:57.830 --> 19:00.333
by the fourth years,
and Cary Agos purchased some.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.462
What?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.933
Um, it was
malpractice insurance.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.268
They're gonna need that
if they go out on their own.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.733
It was $12 million worth,
$800,000 deductible.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.906
Pretty serious.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.942
Are all the fourth years
involved?

19:10.980 --> 19:12.345
Uh, I have to go.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.848
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

19:14.880 --> 19:15.915
Who was that?

19:15.950 --> 19:17.508
Oh, um...

19:17.550 --> 19:18.687
thats”.that
was my brother.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.314
You're a terrible
liar, Robyn.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.657
I'm pretty good at it.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.295
Do you mind putting in a good
word for me at the review?

19:28.330 --> 19:29.752
I'll think about it.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.291
So was that the brother
who you shot?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.432
Uh, who told you that?

19:34.470 --> 19:36.267
Someone at Treasury.
Said you spent

19:36.300 --> 19:38.404
six months in juvenile hall

19:38.440 --> 19:40.408
for accidentally shooting
your brother.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.806
Uh, no. It was
another brother.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.478
Big family.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.977
Mm. Big hippie family?

19:46.010 --> 19:48.217
From Oregon, yeah. Why?

19:48.250 --> 19:49.478
No reason.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.782
Have a good night.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.480
(phone vibrates)

20:04.500 --> 20:06.365
Mom?!

20:20.350 --> 20:21.544
Hello.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.241
You sent another text.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.348
This time, to my daughter.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.812
No.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.353
"Hi. Want to see something?

20:28.390 --> 20:31.587
Open the attachment
idealism.jpg."

20:31.630 --> 20:32.756
I didn't send that.
Okay.

20:32.790 --> 20:34.428
I'm deleting it.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.552
Thanks.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.488
Alicia, wait.
Wait.

20:37.530 --> 20:38.963
You don't write
to my kids.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.661
Alicia, wait.
I didn't send that,

20:40.700 --> 20:41.837
but I might know who did.

20:41.870 --> 20:43.360
We talked like this.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.968
Idealism versus reality.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.932
And then 48 hours later,
by accident,

20:46.970 --> 20:49.700
some anonymous texter sends
this to my daughter?

20:49.740 --> 20:51.549
Come on in.

20:51.580 --> 20:52.945
Please.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.442
It's some friends.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.811
I told them about your case,
our conversation...

21:00.860 --> 21:04.387
not because I wanted them
to do anythIng.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.785
As an object lesson of
what we're up against.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.298
The cynicism.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.592
I think they're trying
to help you.

21:10.630 --> 21:12.461
We don't need help.
You do need help.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.865
I was in court today.
You're losing.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.993
Where did they get this?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.531
My guess is, from
hacking his account.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.401
The police checked
Todd's accounts.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.476
Kids today know how
to delete evidence.

21:22.510 --> 21:23.670
That_doesn't mean
It's gone.

21:23.710 --> 21:24.972
The police don't know
how to hack for it.

21:25.010 --> 21:25.977
My friends do.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.648
It's not helping.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.614
Would you know how to
have found that photo?

21:29.650 --> 21:32.414
No, but the judge
will exclude it.

21:32.450 --> 21:33.417
Not necessarily.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.688
Tell them if they ever

21:34.720 --> 21:36.756
send another text _
to one of my kIds agaIn,

21:36.790 --> 21:38.052
I won't even look at it.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.058
I will immediately delete it.
Understood?

21:40.090 --> 21:42.297
I'll tell them.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.605
WILL: Well, we want
this photo in.
I know.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.631
Parks will argue that
it was obtained illegally.

21:55.810 --> 21:57.698
What if I subpoena
the server?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.604
What server?

21:59.650 --> 22:01.675
We think this photo was
e-mailed from Todd's cell

22:01.720 --> 22:03.585
to his friend Jesse, right?
Right.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.746
But then he deleted it.

22:04.790 --> 22:05.745
So the police never found

22:05.790 --> 22:06.848
the photo on Todd's cell,

22:06.890 --> 22:08.778
but it would still
be on the server.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.378
We don't need this photo,

22:10.430 --> 22:11.727
we need the
identical photo

22:11.760 --> 22:12.988
still on the server.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.520
Good.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.768
How you liking being partner?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.791
I am.
(sighs)

22:27.580 --> 22:29.002
I better...

22:30.780 --> 22:32.771
Okay. See you.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.708
See you.

22:59.810 --> 23:02.404
(knocking)

23:02.440 --> 23:03.805
Mom. Sorry.

23:03.850 --> 23:04.748
No, no, I just...

23:04.780 --> 23:06.509
I wanted to say
I forgot your cell phone,

23:06.550 --> 23:07.812
but I will pick it up tomorrow.

23:07.850 --> 23:09.477
No, that's okay,
Will called.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.714
What?

23:10.750 --> 23:11.682
He...

23:11.720 --> 23:13.517
He said you left
my phone.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.516
Oh.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.788
Yeah, I...

23:16.820 --> 23:18.754
You all right?
Yes.

23:18.790 --> 23:20.724
Um...

23:20.760 --> 23:21.829
Were you praying just now?

23:21.860 --> 23:23.088
Is that what
you were domg?

23:23.130 --> 23:24.495
Yeah.

23:24.530 --> 23:25.792
What were you praying for?

23:25.830 --> 23:27.730
Or is that unluclq?

23:27.770 --> 23:28.839
No. (chuckles)

23:28.870 --> 23:30.667
No, it's not like
a birthday wish.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.701
I don't know.

23:32.740 --> 23:34.571
I want to be respectful.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.146
Do you pray for me?

23:38.180 --> 23:41.047
Sure, all the time.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.219
Because I don't believe?

23:43.250 --> 23:45.844
No, no, just because.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.679
I'm sorry, Grace.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.721
Why?

23:53.760 --> 23:57.662
I wish I were a better mom.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.463
You're a great mom.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.762
No.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.132
I was.

24:03.170 --> 24:06.833
But things are...

24:06.870 --> 24:08.770
out of control.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.475
Is it work?

24:15.120 --> 24:18.817
Do you want me to pray
for something there?

24:21.820 --> 24:23.822
No. I'm fine.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.954
I have to stop thinking
about myself.

24:26.990 --> 24:28.890
Sometimes it's good to
think about yourself.

24:28.930 --> 24:31.160
Yes.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.862
And sometimes it's not.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.505
(no voice)

24:45.850 --> 24:47.613
WILL:
Why, Your Honor?

24:47.650 --> 24:49.914
Because we believe the defendant
deleted photos from his cell.

24:49.950 --> 24:51.747
This is a fishing expedition.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.849
Yes, but an oddly specific one.

24:53.890 --> 24:55.915
Why are you subpoenaing
these exact times?

24:55.960 --> 24:57.279
ALICIA:
Pattern, Your Honor.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.823
It is the only gap in
the defendant's texting history.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.623
And we believe that is because

25:01.660 --> 25:03.821
Mr. Bratcher deleted
those texts.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.565
The police have already covered
this ground.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.828
Then I don't
see the harm.

25:06.870 --> 25:07.837
Your subpoena's
granted.

25:07.870 --> 25:09.565
If this turns
into a broader

25:09.600 --> 25:10.931
expedition, we'll reassess.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.130
Make sure that it doesn't.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.307
Good job.

25:13.340 --> 25:14.671
Thanks. You, too.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.803
Are we really okay
with the fourth years?

25:16.840 --> 25:17.943
I think so.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.039
So another walk together?

25:20.080 --> 25:21.638
People'll say we're dating.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.147
What's going on, Alicia?

25:26.820 --> 25:29.288
You bought
malpractice insurance.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.618
No one told me.
I found out.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.719
Do the partners know?

25:35.760 --> 25:37.022
I'm a partner.

25:37.060 --> 25:39.597
Do the other
partners know?

25:39.630 --> 25:41.894
When are you
leaving, Cary?

25:41.940 --> 25:43.703
A month.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.298
Who are you taking
with you?

25:45.340 --> 25:46.807
The other fourth years.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.034
No, which clients?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.934
I... I can't
tell you that.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.208
Do you really think

25:51.250 --> 25:53.571
it's gonna be better
out there on your own?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.939
Yeah.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.812
Why?

26:02.360 --> 26:05.682
I was comparing Lockhart/Gardner
to a dozen other firms.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.755
It's top-heavy.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.222
Half the equity partners

26:09.260 --> 26:10.989
are soaking up
profit participation

26:11.030 --> 26:12.861
without doing any real work.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.891
What does, what does
Howard Lyman contribute

26:14.940 --> 26:16.134
to Lockhart/Gardner?

26:16.170 --> 26:17.967
And I'm serious.
What does he contribute?

26:18.010 --> 26:18.908
I don't know.

26:18.940 --> 26:21.773
And you know how much
he takes in each year?

26:21.810 --> 26:24.802
$4 million.
For sucking up oxygen.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.841
Look, Alicia,

26:26.880 --> 26:28.871
I know I'm taking
a chance here,

26:28.920 --> 26:31.741
and you, you can get me fired
with just one word,

26:31.790 --> 26:34.156
but you and I
are the new Will and Diane.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.251
Alicia, do me a favor,

26:39.290 --> 26:41.019
think about it.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.288
Think about what?

26:42.330 --> 26:43.399
Leaving with us.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.898
When you were
in law school,

26:45.930 --> 26:48.091
did you want
to change the world?

26:48.140 --> 26:50.859
Did you promise yourself
you would always do right?

26:50.910 --> 26:53.162
And how many times have we done
right in the last four years?

26:53.210 --> 26:56.304
You know I'm right.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.945
Florrick, Agos & Associates.

27:05.350 --> 27:06.988
Alicia...

27:07.020 --> 27:09.079
Let me think about it.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.062
New case?

27:21.100 --> 27:22.192
Do you like it?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.707
Very manly.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.004
I've, uh,
rethought this

27:26.040 --> 27:27.701
Dylan Stack class action.

27:27.740 --> 27:29.435
I think we should
drop it.
Why?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.744
He's not in keeping
with our other clients.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.974
What other clients?

27:33.010 --> 27:37.379
Will... can we drop
the case, please?

27:37.420 --> 27:40.139
Well, it depends.

27:40.190 --> 27:43.079
Who am I talking to,
Diane my partner

27:43.120 --> 27:46.021
or Diane the Supreme Court
candidate?

27:46.060 --> 27:47.459
Do we have a problem?

27:47.490 --> 27:48.889
I didn't think so.

27:48.930 --> 27:52.093
I'm asking for flexibility
on one case.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.427
It's a case
we already decided on.

27:53.470 --> 27:56.234
Yes, and we've changed
our minds before.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.135
Because it was in
the firm's interest.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.434
Just tell me this is in
the firm's interest.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.109
It's in the firm's interest.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.041
There. Happy?

28:08.380 --> 28:10.917
You're talking
to Alicia?

28:10.950 --> 28:12.087
Excuse me?

28:12.120 --> 28:14.111
You said you wouldn't
say a thing.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.880
About what?

28:17.930 --> 28:19.420
(sighs)

28:20.930 --> 28:22.124
About my leaving.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.822
I thought you weren't leaving.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.037
Kalinda, don't talk to Alicia.

28:29.070 --> 28:32.039
Uh, Cary, I didn't say anything.

28:32.070 --> 28:35.039
I trusted you when you told me
that you weren't leaving.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.877
I thought you were
telling me the truth.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.446
That's why I didn't
say a thing.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.781
I also found bruising on Ms.
Selwin's left and right thigh,

28:50.830 --> 28:53.287
and abrasions on the lower back
and buttocks area.

28:53.330 --> 28:54.820
Thank you, Doctor.

28:54.860 --> 28:59.160
And do you interpret
these injuries differently

28:59.200 --> 29:00.519
than the plaintiffs?

29:00.570 --> 29:02.435
Yes. I don't think they're
indicative of rape

29:02.470 --> 29:05.007
as much as vigorous gymnastics
training.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.406
ANDREWS:
And the plaIntIff Is a gymnast?

29:07.440 --> 29:09.908
Yes, that is my
understanding.

29:09.940 --> 29:14.172
Do you interpret these injuries
differently

29:14.220 --> 29:15.869
than the plaintiff's?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.171
Yes, I think...

29:18.450 --> 29:20.145
(sighs)
You said bring it to you.

29:20.190 --> 29:21.487
Leave your kids out of this.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.078
Bring what to me?

29:23.120 --> 29:25.350
I know you like solid things.
This one's on paper.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.926
From your friends?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.154
Your friends, too.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.054
It's regarding
the good doctor in there.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.438
ALICIA:
Dr. Brinks, you stated
that you attended

29:39.470 --> 29:41.938
Baylor University
and studied...?

29:41.980 --> 29:43.174
General obstetrics.

29:43.210 --> 29:45.098
Right. And you wrote
several papers

29:45.150 --> 29:46.174
while there, didn't you?

29:46.210 --> 29:49.213
I... Yes.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.410
Didn't you write a paper
arguing that women

29:50.450 --> 29:52.179
could not get pregnant
when raped?

29:52.220 --> 29:54.051
I'm sorry-- objection!
Relevance.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.388
ALICIA:
Your Honor,
the defense expert's attitude

29:56.420 --> 29:57.921
toward rape
is directly relevant

29:57.960 --> 29:59.484
to his testimony on rape.

29:59.530 --> 30:00.849
PARKS:
Seems inarguable.
Overruled.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.219
I don't know where you got that.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.295
Doctor, you did argue

30:03.330 --> 30:04.991
that the female anatomy of ducks

30:05.030 --> 30:07.066
has evolved to the point where

30:07.100 --> 30:09.034
the reproductive tract
can resist rape.

30:09.070 --> 30:11.004
But that's a draft.
I never submitted it.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.463
And that the same has happened
in adult women?

30:13.510 --> 30:15.102
I wrote that when
I was very young.

30:15.140 --> 30:16.471
I was positing
intellectual theories.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.068
Theories that women can't
really be raped?

30:18.110 --> 30:19.941
No!

30:19.980 --> 30:22.619
That female reproduction

30:22.650 --> 30:25.881
uses trauma
as a block to pregnancy.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.378
Good, as long as we know
how you really think.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.229
Nothing further.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.549
Stand up there.
Yes, you.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.124
Both of you. Stand up.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.525
(people murmuring)

30:40.570 --> 30:43.038
Sheriff, lead these men out
of here.

30:43.070 --> 30:46.267
Take off the mask. Now!

30:46.310 --> 30:47.607
Get 'em out of my courtroom.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.232
Who is that?

30:49.280 --> 30:51.942
Anonymous.

30:57.050 --> 30:59.211
Hi.
Hey.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.514
So here we are.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.585
Here we are.

31:03.620 --> 31:04.223
Alicia asked you

31:04.260 --> 31:06.228
to look into Cary leaving.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.528
Kalinda. ..
What?

31:09.560 --> 31:10.549
Isn't that what happened?

31:12.670 --> 31:15.935
A partner comes to you and asks
you to do some work...

31:15.970 --> 31:17.665
Alicia?

31:17.700 --> 31:20.134
Let me keep it
as a hypothetical.

31:20.170 --> 31:24.243
Um, this partner asks you
not tell anyone else

31:24.280 --> 31:25.679
what you found out.

31:25.710 --> 31:29.339
You know, Lockhart/Gardner
has a lot of people

31:29.380 --> 31:31.245
wanting a lot of
different things.

31:31.290 --> 31:35.511
The problem is is you don't
make that promise.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.155
Hmm?
Okay. Lesson learned.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.657
You never shot your brother.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.499
Yeah, I did.

31:42.530 --> 31:44.521
No, you didn't.
I checked your background.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.698
Why are you checking
my background?

31:47.730 --> 31:51.234
Why are you saying
you shot your brother?

31:51.270 --> 31:53.704
Is this going
to affect my review?

31:53.740 --> 31:55.469
That depends.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.210
I am from Sherwood.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.718
It's outside Portland.

32:03.750 --> 32:07.015
Nothing ever happens
in Sherwood.

32:07.050 --> 32:10.588
Okay.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.121
I'll see you.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.298
(chuckles)

32:35.720 --> 32:37.540
RWLAN:
Mine's the next one over.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.514
Chief Justice,

32:39.550 --> 32:40.710
I'm so sorry.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.355
I saw that
the door was open.

32:43.390 --> 32:45.529
Um, a real tragedy.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.758
Yes, Justice Ludwig
will be missed.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.588
No, let's,
let's chat here.

32:53.630 --> 32:55.530
Here? Are you sure?

32:55.570 --> 32:58.130
Yes. Please.

32:58.170 --> 33:00.138
(chuckles)

33:01.710 --> 33:03.701
Your Honor, ifI
may, I'd, I'd like

33:03.740 --> 33:05.708
t-to get in front
of something

33:05.750 --> 33:08.639
that may concern you.

33:08.680 --> 33:09.772
My private life.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.640
Your secessionist boyfriend.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.646
He doesn't hold
seceSSIonIst VIews.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.658
I don't care-- not about him.

33:15.690 --> 33:16.782
He's not a lawyer.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.651
Oh, well, I was led
to believe...

33:18.690 --> 33:19.725
Yes, you were.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.125
They misunderstood.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.062
I said your "partner,"
they heard "fianc."

33:25.100 --> 33:28.467
My mistake to talk
to a nonlawyer.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.058
My partner?

33:30.100 --> 33:31.636
Yes, the one who was disbarred.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.558
Suspended.

33:33.610 --> 33:38.172
I see, are we engaging in some
extramural sophistry here?

33:38.210 --> 33:40.678
Uh, no.

33:40.710 --> 33:45.613
The review board reconsidered
and suspended him

33:45.650 --> 33:46.742
for his good works.

33:46.790 --> 33:48.781
Ms. Lockhart...

33:50.820 --> 33:55.325
...you have been striving
all your life

33:55.360 --> 33:58.591
to understand the law,
to, to mold it

33:58.630 --> 34:01.235
to your will?

34:01.270 --> 34:02.430
Yes.

34:02.470 --> 34:04.665
You've had losses,
you've had wins.

34:04.710 --> 34:09.636
Well, I am here to tell you
that the law is a mountain.

34:10.710 --> 34:15.738
You've been climbing slowly...
for decades...

34:17.750 --> 34:20.184
...and we've been watching
you climb.

34:20.220 --> 34:23.212
From the top
we've watched you.

34:23.260 --> 34:27.185
Now I can tell
you, you're here.

34:28.230 --> 34:31.267
You've arrived.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.291
This is the top.

34:33.330 --> 34:36.697
This room,
that desk.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.799
And you can either stay...

34:40.570 --> 34:42.709
...or slide back down.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.742
I want to stay.

34:45.780 --> 34:48.271
Of course you do.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.541
You can't engage
in this sophistry.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.854
Your partner is a scoundrel

34:54.890 --> 34:57.859
to be spurned
an-and not embraced.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.319
Do you understand me?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.567
I don't think I do.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.296
Well...

35:08.340 --> 35:10.831
it's very nice to meet you.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.871
Please take the jury
into the holding room.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.688
Anything I need to know?

35:30.720 --> 35:32.688
I don't think so.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.129
PARKS:
Counselors, approach.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.925
The plaintiff's subpoena
has been quashed.

35:40.970 --> 35:42.392
Excuse me, Your Honor, why?
Because your photo

35:42.440 --> 35:43.862
is online.
ANDREWS:
Your Honor,

35:43.900 --> 35:45.208
I can't believe
the plaintiff.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.434
They knew
this photo existed.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.199
Mr. Andrews, quiet.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.346
Mr. Gardner, you
requested a subpoena

35:51.380 --> 35:52.847
for a photo you
knew existed.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.370
No, Your Honor, I did not.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.239
Yes, Counselor...

35:55.280 --> 35:58.249
so your subpoena is
hereby quashed.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.383
ALICIA:
But, Your Honor,
we don't need a subpoena now.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.650
The photo is online.
And illegally obtained,

36:02.690 --> 36:05.727
so, no, this will not be shown
to the jury.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.954
MAN:
Justice for Rainey Selwin.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.924
(gavelbangs)
Justice now.

36:08.960 --> 36:09.824
Justice for Rainey Selwin.
Stop it now.

36:09.860 --> 36:11.623
(gavelbangs)
Justice now.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.865
Justice for Rainey Selwin.
Order. Sheriff,

36:13.900 --> 36:16.198
arrest them.
JustIce now.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.935
Stop it.
Justice now.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.437
Is it true?

36:19.470 --> 36:20.630
That's what I

36:20.670 --> 36:21.932
want to know.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.629
Is what true?

36:23.680 --> 36:24.942
Diane, stop stonewalling.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.402
Brenda saw you
down in Springfield

36:26.450 --> 36:27.701
at the Supreme Court.

36:27.750 --> 36:31.846
I was meeting
with Justice Ryvlan.

36:31.890 --> 36:32.788
(others clamoring)
But is it true?

36:32.820 --> 36:35.414
Are you being considered
for Ludwig's seat?

36:35.460 --> 36:37.712
Don't look at Will.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.852
It's an easy question.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.858
Yes, I am being considered.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.755
(everyone talking at once)

36:42.800 --> 36:43.949
And for how long?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.423
How long have you been
being considered?

36:46.470 --> 36:47.960
Six weeks.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.969
And didn't you think
that was important to tell us?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.865
We didn't want to
unduly alarm anyone

36:52.910 --> 36:54.400
if it wasn't a certainty.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.634
It's not your choice.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.432
This isn't
your personal fiefdom.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.675
What you do affects us.

36:59.710 --> 37:00.699
And did you know?

37:00.750 --> 37:02.012
Your husband is appointing her.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.938
Did you know?
Yes.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.242
(others clamoring)

37:05.290 --> 37:06.882
Diane,

37:06.920 --> 37:08.956
you need to be stepping back
right now.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.457
How are we
supposed to know

37:10.490 --> 37:12.424
whether you're doing for
what's good for the court

37:12.460 --> 37:14.348
or for us?
You don't.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.992
Then step the hell back.

37:16.030 --> 37:17.998
We'll think about it.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.566
Oh, yes, your highness,
please do.

37:19.600 --> 37:20.897
In the meantime, Diane,

37:20.930 --> 37:22.488
you are taking money
out of our pockets

37:22.540 --> 37:23.859
as a profit participant.

37:23.900 --> 37:26.607
(clamoring)
Hold on, hold on, everybody.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.902
(knocking)
Hold on.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.999
Sorry, sorry,
but you need to see this.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.029
Just give us 15 minutes.

37:31.080 --> 37:31.876
It's the Rainey case,

37:31.910 --> 37:33.571
and you're gonna be
getting a call

37:33.610 --> 37:35.510
from the judge any minute.

Citizens of the world,

37:42.820 --> 37:44.583
we at Anonymous have watched

37:47.090 --> 37:49.729
thousands _

37:49.760 --> 37:52.888
This is one such rapist,
Todd Bratcher.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.535
In an effort to aid
the hard-working attorneys

37:55.570 --> 37:57.060
attempting to bring him
to justice,
Uh-oh.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.067
we urge the judge to stop

37:58.100 --> 38:01.035
rejecting worthy evidence,
like this photo.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.072
Why, Your Honor,

38:03.110 --> 38:04.805
are you leaving this out?

38:04.850 --> 38:06.806
Oh, we are so screwed.

38:06.850 --> 38:08.044
Wait. It gets worse.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.047
...they cannot hide.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.014
You have made your victims'
lives hell.

38:11.050 --> 38:13.439
Now it's your turn.

38:13.490 --> 38:14.957
This is the address

You're Anonymous.

There's more than
one Anonymous.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.529
You had nothing to do
with this video?

38:35.580 --> 38:36.399
Not a thing.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.805
Then how did they know
about the photo

38:37.840 --> 38:39.808
we gave the judge.
I don't know.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.545
Maybe they're in court,
watching.
They're not

38:41.580 --> 38:42.979
in the judge's chambers.
You don't know that.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.510
Oh, come on.
What?

38:44.550 --> 38:46.108
Who else was
in the judge's chambers?

38:46.150 --> 38:47.640
The court reporter
or someone at your firm?

38:47.690 --> 38:50.011
You probably discussed
what was said in chambers

38:50.060 --> 38:51.482
back at your firm, right?

38:51.530 --> 38:53.452
Any of them could be Anonymous.

38:53.490 --> 38:54.650
You know what I think, Dylan?

38:54.700 --> 38:57.897
I think every single bit
of this is you.

38:57.930 --> 39:00.524
I think you enjoy
creating paranoia

39:00.570 --> 39:02.595
and confusion
to help your cause.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.665
And what cause is that?

39:04.710 --> 39:07.463
Destroying in order

39:07.510 --> 39:10.070
Maybe, but that video,

39:10.110 --> 39:11.577
it's not me.

39:11.610 --> 39:12.747
Why?

39:12.780 --> 39:14.645
I have a sense of humor.

39:16.650 --> 39:18.447
We're not joining
your class action.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.684
Why not? Out of pique?

39:19.720 --> 39:21.915
No, the firm changed its mind.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.780
We're a democracy.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.048
We do that.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.854
ROBYN:
I have enjoyed

39:27.890 --> 39:29.994
these last four weeks a lot.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.669
Well, it's good that
you've enjoyed yourself.

39:32.700 --> 39:36.397
Um, and I think I've made
a real impact.

39:36.440 --> 39:40.160
So I hope you consider
keeping me.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.132
Are you ready to work
on your own?

39:42.180 --> 39:44.842
If that's what
the partners want.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.144
Um, why don't you give us
a minute, Robyn?

39:50.180 --> 39:51.716
If you have any hesitations,

39:51.750 --> 39:53.843
I hope you give me
a chance to respond.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.755
Certainly. Thank you.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.487
Well, she sure is eager.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.849
Like working with Minnie Mouse.

40:00.890 --> 40:03.029
Kalinda,

40:03.060 --> 40:05.620
do you have
anything to add?

40:05.670 --> 40:06.864
Um...

40:08.540 --> 40:10.098
She's good.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.859
Keep her on.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.571
I'm declaring a mistrial.

40:14.610 --> 40:15.838
Your Honor,
that is grossly unfair.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.973
You will be assigned
a new trial date

40:18.010 --> 40:19.671
and a new judge.

40:19.710 --> 40:20.847
Anything else?
ALICIA:
Our client's contempt citation?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.916
Remains in effect

40:22.950 --> 40:24.986
until such time
as your c|Ient WIshes

40:25.020 --> 40:27.215
to take the necessary action
to cure it.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.854
Your Honor,
our client is still in jail.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.755
It could be months before we get
a new trial date.

40:30.790 --> 40:33.179
Yes, and your friends
should've thought of that.

40:33.230 --> 40:34.925
Anonymous is not our friend.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.052
They made a mockery
of this court,

40:36.100 --> 40:37.852
they instituted mob justice,

40:37.900 --> 40:39.197
made it impossible...

40:39.230 --> 40:41.869
Justice for Rainey Selwin.
Justice now.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.039
Justice for Rainey Selwin.
Justice now.

40:44.070 --> 40:45.731
Justice for Rainey Selwin.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.135
Justice now.

40:47.170 --> 40:50.003
Yeah, I remember Todd Bratcher.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.200
Admitted everything.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.798
The full nine.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.068
Yeah, then his lavwers got
his confession tossed.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.610
He was a hair under 17,

40:56.650 --> 40:59.881
so we got burned
for not notifying his folks

40:59.920 --> 41:01.478
before questioning.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.681
The kid skated,
but I'm past it.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.028
Yeah, well, the girl's not.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.880
She's suing Todd civilly.

41:06.930 --> 41:10.525
I just wish we could use
that confession.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.120
I never knew a cop that
didn't keep a copy for himself.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.991
Just in case
IAD got involved.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.532
If ever there was a moment
to do the rIght thIng,

41:19.570 --> 41:21.709
this is it.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.731
*

41:29.880 --> 41:33.543
* You're gonna have to step over
my dead body *

41:33.590 --> 41:37.708
* Before you walk out
that door *

41:37.760 --> 41:39.819
DETECTIVE:
The important thing is
to get in front of it

41:39.860 --> 41:42.749
so I can tell the
judge you cooperated.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.963
Did she say she
wanted to have sex?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.195
I guess not.

41:48.230 --> 41:50.869
(typing)

41:53.140 --> 41:56.974
* And all the people you see
coming by to save you *

41:57.010 --> 42:01.049
* You're make-believing-on
in your mind *

42:01.080 --> 42:05.084
* Your eyes are holy rollin',
looking, beating, knocking *

42:05.120 --> 42:07.008
* The ceiling gets closer
to you... *

42:07.050 --> 42:09.689
DETECTIVE:
Did she say she
wanted to have sex?

42:09.720 --> 42:11.950
I guess not.

42:11.990 --> 42:13.878
ANDREWS:
Your Honor,

42:13.930 --> 42:15.921
you've already
declared a mistrial.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.052
Yes, but you're still
the judge of record

42:17.100 --> 42:18.249
until such time as...
You can't let

42:18.300 --> 42:19.892
the actions of an
anarchIstIc gang

42:19.930 --> 42:21.591
control your rulings.
Your Honor, please,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.631
forget about
everything else here.

42:23.670 --> 42:25.934
Me, him, Anonymous.

42:25.970 --> 42:28.905
Rainey is being imprisoned
for speaking the truth,

42:28.940 --> 42:30.828
and that is wrong.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.849
This video proves it.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.643
' drip,
' ' drip, drIp,

42:35.680 --> 42:37.079

* There ain't no wow now.
