01:49.520 --> 01:51.522
I was down the shore.
I jumped in the car as soon as I heard.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.284
They called my house instead of the service.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.441
Our girl's Viet Cong.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.280
You couldn't get him a doctor?

02:02.360 --> 02:05.045
Give him two aspirin and call me
when he's not a junkie.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.125
All fucking weekend before they call you?
I want to sue.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.850
Yeah, I'm not sure that's the move right now.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.649
A man tried to kill me.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.643
I got to defend myself.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.882
Then you rolled him in a rug
and dumped his body.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.611
Manslaughter.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.444
Obstruction of justice.

You spoke to him a while back.

Eastern District.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.207
Harlan Reed, counsel for Mr. Finestra.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.770
I had an uncle named Harlan.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.683
We used to call him Harlan Marlin.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.524
- Anybody ever call you Harlan Marlin?
- No.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.841
So at best, we're looking at,
what, manslaughter?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.525
Or murder three. Still up in the air.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.080
- That's 30 years.
- Which is absurd, firstly.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.841
And why does the
US Attorney's Office give a shit?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.445
Corrado Galasso.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.851
How long you been working for him?

03:01.400 --> 03:03.289
- I don't work for Corrado Galasso.
- Richie...

03:03.360 --> 03:04.725
He loaned me money.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.802
I'm paying him back with a pound of flesh.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.451
You know what?
Arraign my client and let's call it a day, guys.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.568

you're fucking broke.

Or, you stay out of jail,

-you help us put an actual criminal in the can.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.966
You want me to rat on Corrado Galasso?

03:30.040 --> 03:31.724
Why don't you just put a bullet
in my head now?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.131
Information, that's all.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.281
You overhear a conversation,

03:34.400 --> 03:36.368
you see something interesting,
you let us know.

- Buck Rogers?

03:38.360 --> 03:40.840
If and when the case ever gets prosecuted,

03:40.920 --> 03:44.208
we'll remind the court how helpful
your client was with Mr. Galasso.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.601
What do you mean by "if and when?"
We solved a homicide...

03:46.680 --> 03:48.205
It's a high-profile murder case.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.611
We're just gonna sweep it under the carpet?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.364
Look, he'll plead to manslaughter.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.124
Feds have a bigger fish with Galasso.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.009
- I don't know anything about Galasso.
- MAN: This is bullshit.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.206
Maury Gold is your friend.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.203
Galasso infiltrated his company years ago.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.203
Didn't infiltrate my fucking company.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.521
I can hold these guys off for a day maybe,
but that's it.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.002
HARLAN: Yeah, you're all heart.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.367
Talk to your client.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.930
We're fairly confident that he can funnel us

04:09.000 --> 04:11.241
some information
without getting himself killed.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.809
You're free to go.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.683
(SCOFFS) What do I think?

04:37.240 --> 04:40.050
I think ratting on Corrado Galasso's
a suicide mission.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.568
But the last guy I know
sent to the can for manslaughter

04:43.640 --> 04:44.971
got all his teeth knocked out

04:45.040 --> 04:47.646
so they could fuck him in the mouth
without scraping.

04:47.880 --> 04:52.363

I don't know what to think.

and we're shooting cover art today.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.440
What happened to Jamie?

11:37.520 --> 11:39.761
She's finally invited to the table,
she doesn't show?

11:39.920 --> 11:42.048
I told her to make sure
the star gets to the studio.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.168
- I understand he likes the needle.
- Who's the photographer?

11:44.240 --> 11:46.129
For the Bits? Shari.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.163
Hal always used Cruz. Gave us a rate, right?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.766
It showed. And speaking of Hal,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.644
I'm gonna make that up to you.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.165
We're bringing Hannibal back here.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.163
All right, yes. That's what I like to hear, yes.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.969
He's already signed to Koronet.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.407
Takes Jackie weeks to put a contract together.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.970
Hannibal only went there 'cause of me.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.731
I know it hurt your feelings.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.406
But you swallow your mammoth fucking ego,
take the guy out to dinner,

12:06.480 --> 12:08.244
he'll be back here in a week.

12:08.320 --> 12:12.086

- ALL: <i>We want you back</i>

12:12.160 --> 12:13.810
- Yes.
- Hannibal!

12:13.920 --> 12:16.651

do what they do, right? All right.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.771

- What?
- SCOTT: What are you talking about? Why?

12:24.080 --> 12:25.923
Okay, come on, what else we got?

Compilation album. Huh?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.321
Rondelay Records Greatest Hits of the '50s.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.086
CBS-FM's all oldies,
like they discovered the wheel.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.930
But, you know, kids are going for it.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.080
You know what? That's a good idea.

Released in conjunction with
American Century Records.

Sit with Julie. Put together a playlist.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.329
- Hmm?
- I think the, uh, mandate here

12:57.400 --> 12:59.164
is to get our living acts up on their feet.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.561
It's a cash cow. You need money.
This is where it comes from.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.087
Well, if Rondelay's gonna pay
all the production costs, then maybe.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.447
But American Century, we can't finance that.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.124
We're launching a sublabel.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.010
If our first release is a '50s compilation,

13:12.080 --> 13:13.161
sounds kind of off.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.242
Yes, and I want to get a band together

13:15.320 --> 13:17.402
-for the kid I'm working, Gary.
- Yes.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.564
We're gonna call him Xavier, actually.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.087
So, if there's any spare cash laying around,
it should go to that.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.288
You A&R now, Zak?

13:24.520 --> 13:25.965
I got a lot of interests.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.565
You American Century now?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.804
Sit with him and put a fucking list together.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.405
Move on.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.361
ANDREA: Corso's coming in today,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.283
so we can get him working on Melanie.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.004
Maybe you sit with him.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.924
Tell him about Zak's kid Xavier,
Maury's record.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.204
Give him something to talk about
with that big mouth.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.771

22:40.640 --> 22:43.007
Uh, is that the kind of thing we're looking for?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.851
- What do you mean?
- You know, he's soulful.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.809
He's a throwback in some ways.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.644
He's like an approachable Dylan.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.644
But then I listen to
these other kids you like, the Nasty Bits.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.889
I don’t... I...

22:59.960 --> 23:02.486
- What?
- Maybe I'm old.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.165
I don't know what I'm supposed
to be looking for anymore.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.924
Fuck that shit, okay?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.321
Come on, next time you go out,
I'll go with you.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.646
- We'll find the next Beatles.
- Great.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.241
That'd be great.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.087
He was at Max's, Springsteen.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.730
Yeah, cool.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.245
Yeah.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.845

23:22.760 --> 23:24.524

23:26.720 --> 23:29.041
- You say hi?
- Sure.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.566
- So?
- She looked good.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.842
She always looks good. What did she say?

23:33.920 --> 23:35.922
"Hey, how you doing?" Nothing.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.401
Well...

23:42.480 --> 23:44.084
She left.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.889

23:46.480 --> 23:47.527
That's how this goes.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.569
You don't have to tell me, man.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.608
God knows that's how it was with Shirley.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.920
Yeah.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.001
What the fuck you doing, man?

23:57.400 --> 23:58.890
Shirley was like a knife to the nuts,

23:58.960 --> 24:01.247
but, Jesus Christ,
you can't let them walk away.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.288
Okay, thanks for stopping by.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.966
- Don't do this, Rich.
- What do you want me to do, huh?

24:06.040 --> 24:10.090
You want me to black her eye,
drag her home by the fucking hair?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.162
I don't know, man. Maybe.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.526
You know? Maybe.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.364
I did squat.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.601

24:16.760 --> 24:19.127
- Wait, you want Shirley back?
- I don't know!

24:19.720 --> 24:21.563

24:22.720 --> 24:24.210
- Julie...
- A compilation?

24:24.280 --> 24:27.363
- Was that for real?
- Yeah, well, my plan's not working, okay?

24:27.440 --> 24:30.125
You want to lay that on me?

24:30.200 --> 24:33.807

24:46.080 --> 24:48.367
Rub on me and then
you hear the word of God?

24:48.440 --> 24:50.204

- Got it.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.602
They brought a big mop and then a cookie,

29:22.680 --> 29:25.126
which I thought was
reinforcing the wrong behavior,

29:25.240 --> 29:27.288

<i>Like a door that keeps revolving</i>

47:52.800 --> 47:56.964
<i>In a half forgotten dream</i>

47:57.840 --> 48:01.162
<i>Or the ripples from a pebble</i>

48:01.240 --> 48:05.723
<i>Someone tosses in a stream</i>

48:05.800 --> 48:09.566
<i>Like a clock whose hands are sweeping</i>

48:09.640 --> 48:13.804
<i>Past the minutes of its face</i>

48:14.520 --> 48:17.603
<i>And the world is like an apple</i>

48:17.680 --> 48:22.447
<i>Whirling silently in space</i>

48:22.520 --> 48:26.081
<i>Like the circles that you find</i>

48:26.160 --> 48:30.609
<i>In the windmills of your mind</i>

48:32.120 --> 48:34.043
Are you fucking high?

48:34.120 --> 48:36.202
I'm so fucking clean, it might kill me.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.566
You just woke both the kids up.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.130
You wouldn't pick up.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.645
I didn't want to talk to you.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.768
Estella will only come four hours a day.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.604
The drag queens scare the shit out of her.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.489
So I actually have to go to sleep at 10:00...

48:46.560 --> 48:47.891
I killed someone.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.926
Buck Rogers.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.771
It was an accident.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.842
He attacked me, and I...

49:00.840 --> 49:03.161
But it was my hands.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.605
And then I tried to hide it.

49:04.680 --> 49:05.727
Me and...

49:07.600 --> 49:08.886
I covered it up.

49:10.160 --> 49:12.083
That's why I jumped off the wagon.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.405
I lost my mind. I didn't know what to do.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.086
I didn't know how to tell you
it happened again.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.491
An accident.

49:18.600 --> 49:22.525
I couldn't stand the idea of you thinking
I was some kind of fucking animal.

49:23.720 --> 49:26.246
I just tried to hold on to it.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.242
I didn't want it to touch you.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.571
But it didn't Work.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.166
But I tried.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.403
Can you see what I'm trying to do?

49:57.560 --> 49:59.005

50:22.440 --> 50:24.522
<i>This is what he said</i>

50:25.680 --> 50:28.126
<i>I'm going downtown</i>

50:29.000 --> 50:30.889
<i>To shoot my old lady</i>

50:30.960 --> 50:33.566
<i>'Cause I caught her with another man</i>

50:39.320 --> 50:42.722

51:50.960 --> 51:53.201

52:00.040 --> 52:02.691
<i>When you're hiking that dress
I must confess</i>

52:04.440 --> 52:07.171

make a filthy mess</i>

52:18.480 --> 52:20.482
Harlan, it's me.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.807
I want to take the deal.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.565
<i>And that's true</i>

52:34.440 --> 52:36.920
<i>Where did you go</i>

52:38.440 --> 52:43.685
<i>When things went wrong, baby?</i>

52:44.760 --> 52:48.321
<i>Who did you turn to</i>

52:49.760 --> 52:55.688
<i>To find a shoulder to lay your head upon?</i>

52:57.120 --> 53:01.842
