WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.576
Man:
PREVIOUSLY,
ON "IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.676 --> 00:11.912
YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING ME
FOR TWO MONTHS,

00:12.012 --> 00:13.914
SAYING,
"LAURA, LAURA LAURA..."

00:14.014 --> 00:17.085
AND YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS IMAGINARY
"GINA" OF YOURS

00:17.185 --> 00:18.986
TO GIVE YOU HER BLESSING.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.321
PAUL,

00:20.421 --> 00:23.257
I'M NOT
WHAT'S STOPPING YOU.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.426
YOU'RE FIGHTING
YOURSELF.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.696
MAYBE YOU CAN ONLY BE
THE PAUL YOU WANT TO BE

00:28.796 --> 00:29.930
WITH HER.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.966
SO GO TO HER.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.568
FIND OUT.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.886
( line rings )

00:52.986 --> 00:56.824
Laura on machine:
Hey, it's Laura.
I'm not in right now--

01:06.567 --> 01:09.370
( line ringing )

01:09.470 --> 01:11.472
Laura on machine:
Hey, it's Laura.
I'm not in right now,

01:11.572 --> 01:14.442
but if you leave
your name and number
i'll call you back.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.245
- ( answering machine beeps )
- LAURA, IT'S--

01:17.345 --> 01:19.813
IT'S PAUL.
ARE YOU THERE?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.851
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.521
I-- I'D REALLY LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.624
I-- I know
that you're upset,

01:30.724 --> 01:32.460
and...

01:32.560 --> 01:34.228
I understand
that I've hurt you.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.298
And believe me
when I say

01:37.398 --> 01:39.433
that was the last thing
I wanted to do.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.903
And I suppose I should hear
what you're saying to me

01:43.003 --> 01:44.872
with your silence...

01:47.308 --> 01:48.942
- HELLO.
- Oh.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.811
YOU'RE THERE.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.580
Yes, I'm here.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.249
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:56.384 --> 01:58.018
- YES, I'M OKAY.
- Okay.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.654
I-- I've been leaving
messages and--

02:00.754 --> 02:02.423
YEAH, I KNOW YOU HAVE.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.127
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO SEE YOU.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.799
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.505
OKAY.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.674
- WHERE DO YOU WANNA MEET?
- Come to my house.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.543
You have the address?

02:23.211 --> 02:25.179
YES, I DO.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.560
( classical music playing )

03:00.548 --> 03:03.417
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE WATCHING ME SLEEP.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.955
YEAH.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.723
ARE YOU GOING OUT?

03:11.058 --> 03:12.760
YEAH, I'M...

03:12.860 --> 03:14.762
I'M GONNA SEE LAURA.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.955
( theme music playing )

04:19.960 --> 04:21.295
( doorbell rings )

04:33.641 --> 04:34.808
HI.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.344
HI.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.713
IT'S WEIRD TO BE
OPENING A DOOR FOR YOU.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.615
I'M USED TO
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.120
- YOU SOUND SICK.
- IT'S JUST A COLD.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.957
I'M OVER
THE WORST OF IT.

04:50.057 --> 04:53.427
- PROBABLY LOOK LIKE SHIT.
- YOU LOOK GREAT.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.930
YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR.
COME IN.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.777
CAN I TAKE YOUR COAT?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.078
THANK YOU.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.417
- Laura: YOU CUT YOUR HAIR?
- NO.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.052
I GUESS I REMEMBER
IT LONGER.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.722
WELL, THIS IS--

05:21.822 --> 05:24.091
- IT'S QUITE A PLACE
YOU HAVE HERE.
- THANK YOU.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.593
ANDREW DID
THE DECORATING.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.828
IT WAS A MESS
WHEN WE MET AND THEN
IT BECAME THIS.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.464
- BECAUSE OF YOUR INFLUENCE.
- OH YEAH, RIGHT.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.500
HE WAS ALWAYS
CLEANING UP AFTER ME.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.839
WELL, IT'S

05:38.939 --> 05:42.009
- QUITE A PLACE.
- DON'T LOOK IN ANY
OF THE CLOSETS.

05:44.978 --> 05:48.281
OH, THOSE ARE THE CHAIRS
THAT ANDREW REUPHOLSTERED,
REMEMBER?

05:48.382 --> 05:50.283
- I THINK I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THOSE.
- OH.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.119
MM-HMM.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.823
WEIRD BEING
IN A PATIENT'S HOUSE?

05:55.923 --> 05:57.758
YOU'RE NOT A PATIENT.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.063
IS THIS HOW
YOU IMAGINED IT?

06:05.032 --> 06:07.435
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I IMAGINED, REALLY. I--

06:07.535 --> 06:09.970
SMALLER, PERHAPS.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.139
MORE BRIGHT COLORS.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.577
DID YOU SEE
THIS EXHIBITION?

06:16.677 --> 06:19.713
NO, I TRIED
BUT THE LINES WERE INSANE,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.281
SO I--
I JUST BOUGHT THE POSTER.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.083
DID YOU SEE IT?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.486
YEAH.
IT WAS AMAZING.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.787
IT WAS A BIT OF A ZOO.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.057
NOT THE OPTIMAL WAY
TO LOOK AT ART.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.460
ANYWAY, WE--

06:32.560 --> 06:36.797
WE TACKLED
OUR WAY THROUGH IT.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.135
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

06:42.235 --> 06:45.506
UH, WATER
WOULD BE GREAT. THANKS.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.644
YOU-- DO YOU NEED ME
TO GIVE YOU A HAND?

06:50.744 --> 06:54.848
FOR A GLASS OF WATER?
I THINK I CAN MANAGE.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.971
( cell phone vibrates )

07:24.411 --> 07:25.913
ARE YOU SURE
JUST WATER?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.748
A FRIEND OF MINE CAME BY
AND STOCKED MY FRIDGE.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.650
I GOT JUICE,
MINERAL WATER,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.719
SOME AMAZING
CHICKEN SOUP.

07:31.819 --> 07:35.422
NO THANKS.
IT'S-- IT'S OKAY.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.558
RACK OF LAMB, MAYBE?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.865
SO-- SO HAVE YOU
SEEN ANDREW?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.969
ARE YOU ON
SPEAKING TERMS?

07:49.069 --> 07:52.172
YEAH.
ACTUALLY HE'S THE ONE
WHO CAME BY WITH THE SOUP.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.074
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW THINGS ARE,

07:54.174 --> 07:56.844
ONE THING LED
TO ANOTHER AND THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW WE WERE...

08:01.248 --> 08:05.318
MY FRIEND JEREMY CAME OVER
AND BROUGHT THE FOOD.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.487
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.857
HE'S GAY.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.399
NO, HE SEEMS FINE.
RESIGNED...

08:19.499 --> 08:22.836
OR IS IT RELIEVED?

08:22.936 --> 08:25.539
I WAS KIDDING BEFORE
ABOUT ANDREW.
I'M SORRY.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.240
I KNOW THAT.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.142
HAVE YOU BEEN UPSET
WITH ME?

08:29.242 --> 08:31.545
NOT UPSET--

08:33.881 --> 08:35.515
FRUSTRATED.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.355
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT I AM TO YOU, PAUL.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.792
I--

08:44.892 --> 08:46.760
I MEAN, I'M NOT
YOUR LOVER.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.663
I'M NOT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.199
I'M NOT YOUR PATIENT.
I MEAN,

08:52.299 --> 08:55.068
THE TRUTH IS THAT
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHO WE ARE TO EACH OTHER.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.610
LET'S DECIDE,

09:02.710 --> 09:04.878
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.884
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.222
IS THIS A TEST, PAUL?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.891
LIKE THE LAST ONE?
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I CAN SURVIVE

09:17.991 --> 09:20.060
TWO OF THOSE
IN ONE LIFETIME.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.697
I LOVE YOU, LAURA.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.703
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT
WANTING TO TALK IN PERSON.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.876
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU LEAVE
ON AN ANSWERING MACHINE.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.746
OF COURSE, I'VE DONE THAT.
I ACTUALLY BROKE INTO
A GUY'S APARTMENT

09:38.846 --> 09:42.382
- AND TRIED TO ERASE IT--
- I'M NOT GOING TO
TAKE IT BACK.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.051
WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY
KNOW THAT, CAN YOU?

09:44.151 --> 09:46.153
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.522
I'M SORRY.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.659
IS IT BECAUSE
I HAVEN'T LEFT HOME?

09:52.660 --> 09:54.294
HOME.
WELL...

09:54.394 --> 09:58.131
THAT'S NOT REALLY
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO
ON MY ACCOUNT.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.370
LOOK, I--

10:03.470 --> 10:05.673
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

10:05.773 --> 10:08.275
WOULD BE
VIEWING THIS WITH--

10:08.375 --> 10:10.978
- WITH CAUTION.
- DON'T EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT I'M DOING.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.214
OKAY.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.084
OKAY.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.155
SO WHAT CHANGED?

10:25.726 --> 10:28.696
I GUESS I JUST
REALIZED WHAT--

10:32.199 --> 10:33.867
WHAT I WAS GONNA LOSE.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.071
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO YOU FOR TWO WEEKS--

10:38.171 --> 10:40.473
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO YOU
OR SEEN YOU,

10:40.573 --> 10:41.842
- HEARD FROM YOU.
- NO, THAT'LL PASS.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.777
- NO, IT WON'T.
- WITH TIME-- YES IT WILL.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.946
YOU'LL GET OVER ME, PAUL.
TRUST ME.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.815
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
LAURA.

10:47.915 --> 10:51.919
I DON'T WANT
TO GET OVER YOU.

11:02.029 --> 11:05.632
I KNOW THAT YOU--
I KNOW THAT YOU TOOK
MY INDECISION--

11:05.733 --> 11:06.633
I'M-- I'M--

11:06.734 --> 11:08.535
I'M DONE WITH THERAPY.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.137
I'M DONE.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.039
YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME
WHERE MY HEAD IS AT,

11:12.139 --> 11:15.408
OR CLAIM THAT EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME
IS FOR MY PROTECTION.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.147
AND WHAT HAPPENED
ABOUT THAT ANYWAY?

11:20.247 --> 11:24.151
YOU WERE SO WORRIED
THAT I WAS REPEATING
OLD PATTERNS WITH YOU,

11:24.251 --> 11:27.487
THAT I WAS-- I WAS--
USING SEX TO BAIL OUT
OF MY RELATIONSHIPS.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.390
- I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE?
- NO.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.962
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
CALLING ME BACK.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.330
YOU'RE SETTING LIMITS
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.966
YOU'RE TAKING A STAND.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.468
YOU'RE THINKING
THINGS THROUGH.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.071
THIS IS ALL YOU.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.574
OH, SO BY WALKING
AWAY FROM YOU IS PROOF
THAT I'M READY TO BE WITH YOU?

11:47.674 --> 11:48.876
I MEAN, HOW SHOULD I PROVE
THAT I'M OVER YOU,

11:48.976 --> 11:52.412
GIVE YOU THE KEY
TO MY HOUSE?
( sighs )

11:58.051 --> 11:59.252
ARE YOU?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.489
ARE YOU OVER ME?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.162
NO, I'M NOT.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.371
BUT I DON'T WANNA BE HAPPY
IN THE MOMENT ANYMORE, PAUL.
I WANT IT TO LAST.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.844
I DON'T WANNA BE
THE FANTASY THAT--

12:23.944 --> 12:26.213
THE CURE TO A MARRIAGE
THAT RAN OUT OF STEAM,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.949
OR A JOB THAT
BECAME ROUTINE.
IT'S--

12:29.049 --> 12:30.383
IT'S JUST
TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

12:30.483 --> 12:34.221
- MAYBE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT--
- I-- LOOK, PAUL,

12:34.321 --> 12:35.889
I KNOW THIS IS WHAT
YOU THRIVE ON,

12:35.989 --> 12:37.557
ALL THIS
BACK-AND-FORTH STUFF,

12:37.657 --> 12:40.193
BUT...

12:40.293 --> 12:42.495
LET'S NOT TALK.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.165
HMM?

12:45.265 --> 12:48.335
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU JUST DON'T TALK?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.310
OKAY.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.987
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT THIS, PAUL.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.192
DO YOU?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.064
I DO.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.055
( knocking on door )

15:00.467 --> 15:02.369
PAUL.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.105
( sighs )
HI, GINA.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.074
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- SORRY FOR--

15:07.174 --> 15:08.976
LOOK, I'M SORRY
FOR BARGING IN LIKE THIS--

15:09.076 --> 15:10.777
NO NO.
COME IN.

15:10.877 --> 15:13.513
- ARE YOU SURE?
- OH, SURE. COME IN.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.582
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.017
OH--

15:18.851 --> 15:20.453
IT'S--

15:25.458 --> 15:27.127
I SAW LAURA TODAY.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.097
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH HER SINCE
ALEX'S FUNERAL.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.464
SHE HASN'T BEEN
RETURNING MY CALLS.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.767
- DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN?
- NO. PLEASE.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.337
YOU SAW EACH OTHER
AT ALEX'S FUNERAL?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.173
YEAH.
SO I'VE BEEN CALLING HER

15:40.273 --> 15:42.475
AND FINALLY SHE PICKED UP

15:42.575 --> 15:44.611
AND SHE SAID...

15:44.711 --> 15:46.946
"WHY DON'T YOU--

15:47.047 --> 15:49.216
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER?

15:49.316 --> 15:51.951
SO I WENT OVER THERE
TO TELL HER

15:52.052 --> 15:54.821
THAT I WAS THROUGH

15:54.921 --> 15:58.591
WITH DRIVING
US BOTH CRAZY.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.061
AND THAT--

16:01.161 --> 16:03.997
AND THAT I LOVED HER
AND THAT...

16:04.097 --> 16:06.299
I WAS READY

16:06.399 --> 16:10.237
TO BE--
TO BE WITH HER.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.741
YOUR WORST FEAR
REALIZED, GINA.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.410
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, PAUL.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.547
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.585
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.624
ANYWAY, WE--
WE ENDED UP-- UH...

16:33.093 --> 16:35.162
IN THE BEDROOM.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.730
WAIT, SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU

16:37.830 --> 16:40.733
- AND YOU ENDED UP
IN THE BEDROOM?
- ( snorts )

16:40.833 --> 16:42.669
YEAH.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.072
ANYWAY, I--

16:45.172 --> 16:46.606
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.508
I--

16:50.143 --> 16:52.645
I COULDN'T.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.114
YOU COULDN'T?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.483
YOU MEAN,
YOU COULDN'T RESPOND?

16:56.583 --> 16:59.752
I HAD A FUCKING
ANXIETY ATTACK.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.089
LIKE A TEENAGE KID--

17:02.189 --> 17:04.957
A FUCKING ANXIETY ATTACK.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.094
UNBELIEVABLE.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.495
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

17:08.595 --> 17:11.464
LIKE I WAS SUFFOCATING,
HEART POUNDING,

17:11.564 --> 17:14.634
DRENCHED IN SWEAT.
IT WAS THAT CLASSIC TEXTBOOK

17:14.734 --> 17:18.271
PANIC ATTACK.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.707
DID YOU TALK
TO HER ABOUT IT?

17:20.807 --> 17:23.543
- DID YOU TELL HER
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO YOU?
- IT WAS SEX, GINA.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.613
IT WASN'T LIKE IT WAS
A SESSION OR ANYTHING.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.617
I GOT OUT OF THERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.586
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.
BY THE TIME IT TOOK...

17:33.686 --> 17:37.724
FOR ME TO MAKE UP
MY MIND ABOUT BOTH OF US,

17:37.824 --> 17:39.392
SHE'D CHANGED HERS.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.629
SHE CHANGED HER MIND
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT RAN OUT.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.466
NO, SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT IT ANYMORE.

17:46.566 --> 17:50.270
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT--
JUST TAKE A BREATH

17:50.370 --> 17:52.405
AND START AT THE BEGINNING.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.308
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.910
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.846
I COULDN'T--

18:00.780 --> 18:02.415
I--

18:02.515 --> 18:06.052
I COULDN'T EVEN
BRING MYSELF TO--

18:06.153 --> 18:08.755
TO TOUCH HER.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.824
SHE WAS THIS CLOSE TO ME.
I COULD FEEL THE HEAT
FROM HER BODY.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.927
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, GINA?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.796
HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE IMAGINED THAT?

18:16.896 --> 18:19.999
NEXT THING I KNOW
I'M DOUBLED OVER
THE HOOD OF MY CAR

18:20.099 --> 18:23.370
GASPING FOR AIR.
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH ME, GINA?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.473
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.808
YOU SEE THIS
AS A BETRAYAL

18:28.908 --> 18:32.044
AS THOUGH YOU
SABOTAGED YOURSELF.
I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.281
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.
FOR YOU, IT'S GOOD NEWS.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.349
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

18:36.449 --> 18:38.185
WHAT A HORRIBLE MISTAKE
I'M MAKING--

18:38.285 --> 18:40.553
RUINING MY LIFE.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.922
YOU SHOULD BE READY
TO OPEN A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.693
PAUL, THE LAST TIME WE MET
I SAID THIS HAD TO BE
YOUR DECISION.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.796
YOU KNOW, WHEN
IT CAME DOWN TO IT
IN THE END, GINA,

18:49.896 --> 18:52.365
IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MORAL QUESTIONS,

18:52.465 --> 18:56.603
OR INTEGRITY,
OR MY MARRIAGE, OR YOU.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.004
WHAT WAS IT THEN?

18:58.104 --> 19:00.173
I HAD THIS FEELING THAT...

19:01.874 --> 19:03.843
I WAS GOING TO BE
SWALLOWED--

19:05.512 --> 19:08.348
SWALLOWED UP
BY ALL OF IT.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.150
AND THAT I
WAS GONNA LOSE...

19:13.686 --> 19:15.154
CONTROL.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.194
ANYWAYS, I RAN OUT THE DOOR.
I THOUGHT OF YOU--

19:21.294 --> 19:23.930
ALL THE TIMES THAT
I SAID THAT YOU WERE A COWARD.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.366
WELL, WHO'S THE COWARD NOW?

19:32.539 --> 19:35.608
YOU KNOW, PAUL,
THAT ANXIETY ATTACK WAS YOURS.

19:35.708 --> 19:39.612
IT WASN'T EXTERNAL.
IT WAS YOU.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.416
WHAT RESTRAINED YOU

19:43.516 --> 19:47.320
WAS THE--
WAS THE VERY BEST OF YOU--

19:47.420 --> 19:49.289
YOUR DEEPEST STANDARDS,

19:49.389 --> 19:52.191
PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL
AND MORAL.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.327
NO, GINA.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.729
MORAL DECISIONS DON'T
COME FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.299
I'M NOT GONNA LET MYSELF
OFF THE HOOK THAT EASILY.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.968
PAUL, YOU STEERED
YOURSELF AWAY

20:02.068 --> 20:06.005
FROM DOING SOMETHING
THAT YOU KNEW YOU WOULD REGRET.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.342
YOU SAVED YOURSELF
FROM BEING HURT

20:09.442 --> 20:11.911
AND FROM HURTING A WOMAN
THAT YOU CARED ABOUT.

20:14.781 --> 20:18.585
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
THAT MORAL DECISIONS

20:18.685 --> 20:21.621
ARE ALWAYS MADE
IN THE ABSENCE
OF TEMPTATION,

20:21.721 --> 20:25.358
THAT THEY'RE MADE EASILY,
THAT THEY'RE MADE GRACEFULLY?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.660
GIVE YOURSELF
SOME CREDIT.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.030
IF YOU WERE ABLE TO MAKE
THIS DECISION EASILY,

20:31.130 --> 20:32.665
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SIGN

20:32.765 --> 20:35.602
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT HER
THAT BADLY.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.304
BUT YOU DID.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.640
YOU WANTED HER
SO VERY BADLY--

20:40.740 --> 20:44.544
SO BADLY THAT YOU HAD
AN ANXIETY ATTACK

20:44.644 --> 20:47.013
IN ORDER
TO STOP YOURSELF.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.116
SO IN THE END YOU WON.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.452
YOU PREVAILED.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.525
WELL, THANK YOU FOR TRYING
TO CONSOLE ME, GINA.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.394
I'M NOT CONSOLING YOU.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.430
I JUST WANT YOU
TO TAKE THE CREDIT

21:03.530 --> 21:05.732
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY

21:05.832 --> 21:07.734
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.843
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?

21:16.943 --> 21:20.279
SHE SAID THAT SHE'S COME
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT
SHE'S BEEN DOING,

21:20.380 --> 21:23.983
YOU KNOW, USING
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS

21:24.083 --> 21:26.719
TO FREE HERSELF
FROM EMOTIONAL...

21:26.819 --> 21:30.857
ENTANGLEMENTS,
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.465
IT'S IRONIC.

21:38.565 --> 21:41.501
HER THERAPY WITH YOU
HAS BEEN A SUCCESS.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.603
HMM.

21:43.703 --> 21:47.474
SHE SAID THAT--
THAT WHAT I WAS DOING

21:47.574 --> 21:51.043
WAS THAT I WAS USING HER
TO BAIL MYSELF OUT
OF MY OWN LIFE--

21:51.143 --> 21:52.879
THAT ACTUALLY
I WAS HAVING

21:52.979 --> 21:55.948
A MIDLIFE CRISIS.

21:56.048 --> 21:59.318
HILARIOUS DESCRIPTION.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.554
THAT'S YOUR THEORY,
ISN'T IT?

22:01.654 --> 22:04.023
NO, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.658
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.294
YOU KNOW,
WHAT MATTERS, PAUL,

22:08.395 --> 22:10.430
IS THAT YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU

22:10.530 --> 22:12.465
AND FOR YOUR PATIENT.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.036
SHE COULD BE THE LAST...

22:17.136 --> 22:19.706
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.342
AND I LET HER GO.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.786
WHAT'S LEFT
FOR ME NOW, GINA? HM?

22:39.592 --> 22:42.094
WE'LL HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT.
