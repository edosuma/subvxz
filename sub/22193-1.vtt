01:24.517 --> 01:27.646
( bell clangs )

01:27.720 --> 01:31.054
Lunch is ready!

01:40.500 --> 01:43.698
- Grandma.
- Hmm?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.432
Can I go up to school
after lunch to help Mr. Perry?

01:45.538 --> 01:48.133
That's fine.
Just be home before supper.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.850
Man: Yield's gonna
be lower this year.

02:03.923 --> 02:05.687
Grandma:
It's too early to tell.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.590
It's getting lower
every year.

02:40.593 --> 02:44.428
- Hey, Mr. Gieger.
- Hi, sweetheart.

02:52.272 --> 02:56.232
Grandma: Margaret left
on her wheel right after lunch.

02:56.309 --> 02:59.108
Wish you wouldn't
call it a wheel, Grandma.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.638
Bicycle's got two wheels.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.547
You make it sound like
it's just got one.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.586
I just thought
she'd be back by now.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.713
Margaret couldn't have made it
all the way over to Babylon

03:09.822 --> 03:12.587
if she just had one wheel
to do it with.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.759
Belinda Hale.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.603
Hey, Ms. Larkin.
Hey, Jerry.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.504
Hey, Belinda.
How are you?

03:26.606 --> 03:28.575
Guess what?

03:28.641 --> 03:30.166
I just got elected co-captain
of the cheerleaders.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.474
Congratulations!
That's real fine!

03:33.613 --> 03:36.549
- That's good, Belinda.
- Thanks, Jerry.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.278
Oh, hey, how are the berries
gonna be this year?

03:38.351 --> 03:40.047
Just fine.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.587
We'll send you and your daddy
over a few pints

03:41.654 --> 03:43.589
just as soon as Boy Scouts
and Girl Scouts start picking.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.023
Oh, you have no idea how much
I'd be looking forward to that.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.723
- Ms. Nina!
- Hey, Margaret.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.893
You should come
by the house some time.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.994
Pick all the blueberries
you like

03:57.070 --> 03:58.538
before all the Boy Scouts
come and take them all.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.573
- Well, thank you, I will.
- ( thunder crashes)

04:00.640 --> 04:03.576
Ooh, you better go on now
before it gets bad.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.942
- I will.
- Tell your grandma I said hi, now.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.277
- All right, see ya!
- Hurry up, Margaret, hurry!

04:08.348 --> 04:11.546
I brought you some things
to do up for me.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.313
I probably found them
in the back of my closet,

04:13.386 --> 04:15.321
lying there since like two years
and 15 pounds ago.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.552
- So what do you think?
- Short.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.649
- But they're so cute, though.
- You got a mark where you want them?

04:20.726 --> 04:23.060
- No, ma'am.
- Hold that.

04:33.206 --> 04:37.143
You didn't happen to see her
when you passed, did you?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.179
Oh, no, I didn't see anybody
on my way over.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.714
Well, expect Mr. Geiger fishing,
but he was already packing up.

04:53.726 --> 04:57.026
(grunts)

05:07.106 --> 05:10.599
Thank you, Ms. Larkin.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.542
Well, I best get back
to Babylon

05:12.612 --> 05:14.604
so I can fix Mr. Red
his dinner.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.649
Oh, how is his neck anyway?

05:16.716 --> 05:18.708
Oh, well, let's just say
if you was to stick

05:18.785 --> 05:21.050
a loaded shotgun
at the back of his neck,

05:21.120 --> 05:22.782
he wouldn't even be able
to turn around enough

05:22.889 --> 05:24.653
to know it was you
who was doing it.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.317
Jerry!

05:31.564 --> 05:35.160
Be good to your grandma,
now, Jerry!

05:35.234 --> 05:37.362
And when I see Margaret,
I'll give her a ride!

05:37.437 --> 05:40.066
Grandma:
Please do!

05:42.742 --> 05:45.940
(screams)

05:50.149 --> 05:53.677
( pop music
playing faintly)

06:20.313 --> 06:23.681
( car door closes)

06:23.783 --> 06:25.411
(engine starts)

06:35.795 --> 06:39.061
( coughs loudly)

06:40.800 --> 06:42.063
You're late, Miss Pie.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.503
How many times
have I told you?

06:47.573 --> 06:49.906
Please do not call me that.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.978
I'm fat and I know it,
but I would appreciate

06:52.044 --> 06:54.536
you not drawing attention
to it.

06:54.647 --> 06:55.842
What in the world
are you doing out here?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.350
Nina brought me out here
before she left.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.751
I was sure you'd show up
before the rain.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.853
Oh!
Don't do that!

07:04.924 --> 07:07.723
I want to hear the rain!

07:07.827 --> 07:09.159
I would appreciate
some thanks.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.856
I just saved you
from your watery grave.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.558
- Hey, Daddy.
- What do you want?!

07:12.665 --> 07:14.930
Nathan wanted to know
if Belinda was here,

07:15.001 --> 07:17.163
- and I see she is.
- What does Nathan want with Belinda?

07:17.236 --> 07:20.365
I don't know, something
to do with supper, I guess.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.739
Well, that Nathan
can take care of himself.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.368
Oh, why don't I just go see
what Nathan wants?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.914
- Now come take care of your daddy untill get back.
- Take him with you.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.779
I don't have anything
to say to him.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.011
And he don't have nothing
to say to me!

07:32.084 --> 07:34.178
Daddy!

08:22.935 --> 08:26.235
(gasps )

08:27.106 --> 08:28.130
Jerr...

08:30.343 --> 08:31.675
Help!

08:33.746 --> 08:35.339
(gasping )

08:37.917 --> 08:41.376
(screaming and whimpering )

08:43.923 --> 08:46.893
Grandma, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

08:46.959 --> 08:50.623
I just went out to check
the berries,

08:50.696 --> 08:52.221
- had a look at the bridge.
- What about it?

08:52.331 --> 08:54.493
Well, there's...
there's five planks gone.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.865
- But I'll fix it in the morning.
- What about Margaret?

08:56.936 --> 08:59.565
How's she gonna
get home tonight?

09:51.023 --> 09:54.323
Margaret?!

09:59.999 --> 10:03.436
I already made the call.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.368
Well... w-where is she?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.806
Is she coming back?

10:09.108 --> 10:10.872
I talked to Mr. Perry
over at the high school.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.212
He said she left at 5:00.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.285
I guess it makes sense
to talk to the Sheriff now.

10:20.853 --> 10:24.051
Where... is Margaret?

10:24.190 --> 10:27.285
( rock music playing faintly)

10:37.637 --> 10:41.165
- ( barks )
- Oh, hey, hey, hey!

10:41.273 --> 10:43.435
Man: Down, Maisy.
I'm sorry, Ted.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.636
She just gets so excited.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.737
(sighs) You know you got
to have her on a leash, right?

10:47.813 --> 10:50.749
- It's a new rule.
- Oh, I know, yeah.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.291
Morning, Sheriff.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.330
Sheriff.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.525
Sheriff?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.465
Evelyn and Jerry Larkin
are here to see you.

11:11.904 --> 11:15.602
If there had been
some kind of an accident,

11:15.675 --> 11:17.940
it would've been reported.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.603
She can't have gotten
very far on a bike.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.511
Well, then where is she?

11:21.614 --> 11:22.946
Jerry, I want you to take
Ms. Larkin home.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.950
Ms. Larkin,
I want you to stay there.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.952
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm gonna go find Margaret.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.113
- Guess wha...
- Not now, honey.

11:31.323 --> 11:32.291
Okay.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.799
We will find her.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.699
(shouting indistinctly,
rock music continues )

12:04.056 --> 12:07.993
Hey, we need to go the bank
while we're here.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.087
How can you think like this
when Margaret's still missing?

12:12.064 --> 12:15.694
I'm thinking
about things like this

12:15.801 --> 12:17.167
because I know Margaret
will be back.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.001
I want to do this now
while we're together.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.904
I don't want you home alone.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.483
How are you, Ms. Larkin?
How are you?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.423
Fine.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.790
Well, I was hoping that you
would come in today

12:43.896 --> 12:45.762
'cause I've been meaning
to talk to you about your loan.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.300
Today's not a real good day
to talk about that.

12:48.367 --> 12:51.030
I'm sorry, Ms. Larkin, I hate
to be the one to bring it up.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.572
Now, you know that you've been
behind on your payments

12:53.672 --> 12:55.664
- for eight months, right?
- Is there something wrong here, Grandma?

12:55.741 --> 12:59.109
Jerry, I take it you
were making a payment

12:59.211 --> 13:02.477
on your overdue loan there.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.346
Jerry: We gotta wait until
the first berries sell.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.351
I've been making little
installments on it, though, so.

13:06.418 --> 13:10.116
Well, um...
your little installments

13:10.222 --> 13:12.384
haven't been amounting to much,
see, that's the problem.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.757
Your daddy never used
to talk to us like this.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.625
Your daddy never used to talk to
any of your customers like this.

13:17.696 --> 13:21.224
- Ms. Larkin, my daddy's laid up...
- Grandma, let's go, come on.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.065
Woman: She was here yesterday
with Warren Perry.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.072
She was helping him
record supplies.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.074
My goodness, Evelyn must just
be going out of her mind.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.441
Oh, she is, she is.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.537
Well, I will check on her.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.081
You know, Warren's
not here today.

13:56.802 --> 14:00.261
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Hey, Warren.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.173
You found Margaret yet?

14:03.275 --> 14:04.299
No, I haven't.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.039
I want to speak
to you about her.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.638
I can't imagine
what happened.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.512
She was, um...

14:11.584 --> 14:12.882
she worked with me
until about 5:00.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.217
And then it looked like rain
and, uh...

14:15.287 --> 14:17.256
and then I offered her
a ride home,

14:17.323 --> 14:19.121
but she said she had
enough time to make it.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.853
Hmm. What was she doing
helping you?

14:21.293 --> 14:24.991
Helping me check in
text books.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.123
No, I-I mean, uh...

14:27.199 --> 14:30.328
why was she helping you?

14:30.436 --> 14:32.132
She liked to help,
I suppose.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.572
Does she help other teachers?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.337
No. Just me.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.272
Look, Sheriff,
I hate to run,

14:43.649 --> 14:45.174
but I've gotta visit
my mom up north.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.888
Okay, Warren.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.084
(engine starts)

16:04.296 --> 16:07.391
Grandma!

16:08.734 --> 16:12.068
Come see.

16:52.644 --> 16:55.808
Jerry!

16:55.914 --> 16:58.349
Come here! Now!

16:58.784 --> 17:00.309
Come over here right now!

17:07.326 --> 17:10.454
Is that...

17:13.598 --> 17:16.865
(grunting )

17:20.705 --> 17:24.301
- Don't come, Grandma!
- What is it?

17:24.443 --> 17:26.742
Go on back
to your house, now!

17:26.811 --> 17:29.281
Oh, God.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.010
Oh, Margaret!
(screams)

17:31.884 --> 17:35.252
- Grandma!
- I'll get help!

17:35.354 --> 17:37.289
(screams)

17:37.356 --> 17:40.690
(sobbing ) Margaret!

17:44.897 --> 17:48.265
I don't imagine Ed Gieger's

17:48.367 --> 17:49.801
gonna be fishing
that spot any longer.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.996
Those are rope burns
on her wrists.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.734
Let's get her out of here.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.309
Ms. Larkin don't need
to see us stand around

17:57.376 --> 17:59.572
staring at her like she's
some kind of dead rattler.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.121
- Is she dead?
- Ms. Larkin...

18:15.227 --> 18:18.391
Is Margaret dead?!

18:18.497 --> 18:21.262
No, don't you put her
in that truck!

18:21.333 --> 18:23.859
(sobbing ) My Margaret!
I want Margaret!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.929
Let me up!
Let me up!!

18:27.039 --> 18:29.372
(sobbing )

18:31.410 --> 18:35.347
Now, don't you get up
tilll tell you to,

18:35.414 --> 18:36.780
- all right, Ms. Larkin?
- ( crying softly)

18:36.882 --> 18:38.817
You get some rest.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.365
Evelyn:
I love my little girl.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.569
We can't find Margaret.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.846
Margaret?!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.385
Jerry:
Margaret's dead!

19:13.452 --> 19:15.944
Margaret:
I know I'm dead.

19:16.054 --> 19:18.580
You've been
behind on your payments.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.421
Evelyn: Nathan Redfield
killed my little girl.

19:34.773 --> 19:38.403
Sheriff:
I never seen nothing like this,

19:38.477 --> 19:41.413
little girl tied
to her bike

19:41.480 --> 19:43.915
and dumped in the river?

19:43.982 --> 19:47.612
Man:
You have any idea who did it?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.383
No, I don't.

19:50.489 --> 19:51.923
We had a Saturday night
poker murder

19:54.193 --> 19:56.458
north side of town
about a year ago.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.861
But everybody knew
who did it

19:58.964 --> 20:00.432
and nobody tried
to keep it a secret.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.469
But I never seen nothing
like this.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.403
16-year-old girl.

20:07.472 --> 20:10.442
Well, you might want to have
a little chat with the father.

20:11.176 --> 20:14.442
He's dead.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.539
In fact, he died in the sticks,
too, about 13 years ago.

20:16.648 --> 20:19.482
No, I mean the father
of the baby she's carrying.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.481
This girl's about
four months pregnant.

20:29.294 --> 20:32.753
Behold,
I show you a mystery.

20:33.332 --> 20:36.598
We shall not all sleep,

20:36.668 --> 20:39.194
but we shall be changed
in a moment.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.796
For the trumpet shall sound,

20:41.873 --> 20:44.308
and the dead shall be raised
incorruptibly.

20:44.376 --> 20:47.676
And we shall all be changed.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.851
Jerry, can I talk to you
for a moment?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.622
Sure.
I'll be right there.

21:02.728 --> 21:06.062
You tell him, Jerry!
You tell him!

21:09.101 --> 21:10.535
Tell me what?

21:12.537 --> 21:14.836
She thinks you're going
back into Babylon

21:14.906 --> 21:17.603
to arrest a man
that killed Margaret.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.735
Jury's gonna declare
him guilty in two days

21:19.845 --> 21:22.371
and she's gonna pull
the switch on the chair.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.481
Well, who's she
expect me to arrest?

21:24.516 --> 21:26.515
She got anyone
particular in mind?

21:26.585 --> 21:29.054
Nathan Redfield.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.919
( whistles sharply)

21:31.023 --> 21:32.355
You try to talk her
out of that?

21:32.424 --> 21:34.518
'Cause you know
that's just crazy.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.255
I know it.
That's what she believes.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.523
- You want me to talk to her?
- Ain't no point in it.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.932
So what'd you need
to talk to me about?

21:44.603 --> 21:47.630
Did you know Margaret
was pregnant?

21:47.739 --> 21:49.731
Why would you say that?

21:49.808 --> 21:52.505
Coroner in Pensacola
found out

21:52.611 --> 21:53.943
when he examined her
Saturday night.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.242
She was in her fourth month.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.749
Just don't tell Grandma,
okay?

21:57.816 --> 21:59.682
I got to or else you got to.
It's gonna come out.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.119
Does it have to?

22:03.221 --> 22:04.655
What does that have to do
with Margaret getting killed?

22:04.723 --> 22:06.851
Whoever got
a 16-year-old girl pregnant

22:06.925 --> 22:09.360
is gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.363
And since Margaret didn't have
any enemies anybody knew about,

22:11.430 --> 22:14.298
might've been the father
who killed her.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.732
I was hoping
you knew about it.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.567
Maybe your grandma
knows about it.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.664
Maybe Margaret
confided in her.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.742
I doubt it.
I just really doubt it.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.479
( couple moaning )

22:32.117 --> 22:35.383
Belinda:
You bit me all over.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.753
Now I'm gonna go
and have to tell Daddy

22:37.823 --> 22:40.588
I got trapped under
a ten-girl pyramid.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.821
Your daddy's never gonna see
all them bruises.

22:42.928 --> 22:46.092
Well...
somebody else might.

22:50.669 --> 22:54.128
You better be making a joke.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.675
If I find out that it's true,
headlines are gonna read

22:56.775 --> 23:00.278
"Cheerleader smothered to death
with her own pom-poms."

23:00.313 --> 23:02.645
(laughs)

23:05.684 --> 23:08.984
I was only kidding.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.386
But now I won't
be able to wear

23:10.489 --> 23:11.821
a bathing suit for the next
five days and four nights.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.587
What time you suppose
it's getting to be?

23:14.693 --> 23:17.128
I don't know.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.788
I suppose... hey!

23:20.632 --> 23:22.624
What is it?

23:22.701 --> 23:24.465
Something dripped on me.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.971
It's just water, I guess.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.973
But... (gasps)

23:29.040 --> 23:31.274
Damn it, Belinda!

23:31.309 --> 23:32.641
There is something
up in that tree.

23:36.715 --> 23:40.083
There's no one in that tree.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.778
There was someone up there-

23:41.853 --> 23:44.652
Wait, what did he
look like then?

23:44.723 --> 23:46.692
It looked like a woman.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.873
There's nothing in that tree.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.636
It's so dim in here,
that moss could look

24:03.742 --> 24:05.608
like anything you want it to.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.212
I don't care if you believe me
or not.

24:07.345 --> 24:08.711
But I would appreciate it
to no end

24:08.847 --> 24:10.611
if you'd put down
that bottle of bourbon

24:10.682 --> 24:12.207
and get me out of here.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.928
Just listen-

24:38.543 --> 24:42.207
There's nothing there.
You just got scared.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.408
Damn it, Nathan, you were
just as scared as I was!

24:44.483 --> 24:46.645
No, I wasn't.
(laughs)

24:46.751 --> 24:49.050
Now go on.
Go on, I'll be right behind you-

24:49.120 --> 24:52.249
But don't start off until
I get in the Scout

24:52.324 --> 24:54.088
and get it started,
do you hear me?

24:54.159 --> 24:55.821
- Okay.
- Yeah?

24:55.927 --> 24:56.951
( frustrated )
Okay!

25:03.768 --> 25:06.761
( yelps )

25:06.838 --> 25:08.101
- What is it?
- God.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.301
Nathan, that seat
is soaking wet!

25:12.811 --> 25:14.074
Damn it, Belinda.

25:16.281 --> 25:17.749
What is it?

25:21.019 --> 25:24.512
I don't know what it is.

25:24.623 --> 25:25.989
Just put a blanket
down on it.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.734
Go on, get out of here!

26:01.393 --> 26:04.727
(door opens )

26:08.633 --> 26:12.764
Sheriff: Nobody is forgetting
about Margaret, Ms-Larkin.

26:13.805 --> 26:17.765
Just right now, we have no idea
who could've killed her.

26:17.842 --> 26:20.778
Nathan Redfield killed her!

26:20.845 --> 26:23.144
God!

26:23.214 --> 26:25.649
I know Jerry told you

26:25.717 --> 26:28.243
Margaret
was gonna have a baby.

26:28.353 --> 26:31.289
Now, do you think
it could've been Warren Perry?

26:31.356 --> 26:33.951
If you'd just sit still
for five minutes,

26:34.025 --> 26:36.460
you would know that it was
Nathan Redfield that did this-

26:36.528 --> 26:39.396
It's because Nathan
is your friend

26:39.497 --> 26:41.966
and because he has
all the money in the world

26:42.033 --> 26:44.832
that you don't want
to do anything about it-

26:47.706 --> 26:50.699
Go! Go!!

26:54.079 --> 26:57.106
Man: If you could've brought me
some proof,

26:57.215 --> 26:59.013
little piece of something
I can tag in a courtroom,

26:59.084 --> 27:01.747
I might consider it,
but if I took this on now,

27:01.853 --> 27:04.721
I'd be making a fool of you
and myself to boot.

27:04.889 --> 27:08.223
He got to you first-

27:08.293 --> 27:10.785
Ms. Larkin, I handle CP&M.

27:10.895 --> 27:13.364
But Nathan, he don't even
speak to me on the street-

27:13.431 --> 27:15.866
And how would he know you were
coming over here anyway?

27:15.934 --> 27:18.130
- 'Cause Ted Hale told you.
- Grandma-

27:18.236 --> 27:21.070
Mr. Darrish was real nice
in listening to us,

27:21.473 --> 27:24.807
but he can't help.

27:24.909 --> 27:26.707
And we are not to take up
any more of his time.

27:26.778 --> 27:29.873
(door opens )

27:29.948 --> 27:31.610
(sighs) Thank you,
Mr. Darrish-

27:31.716 --> 27:33.844
I really appreciate you
listening to us-

27:33.918 --> 27:35.682
Anytime.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.017
I suspected
you wouldn't help us,

27:37.088 --> 27:38.920
so I called a lawyer
in Pensacola-

27:38.990 --> 27:40.856
- Grandma!
- Really, who?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.484
Warren Perry's cousin,
Henry Harp.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.893
He's taking us
to supper this evening.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.893
(splashing footsteps )

28:26.938 --> 28:30.102
Nathan-( chuckles )

28:30.175 --> 28:32.644
You all right?

28:33.511 --> 28:34.535
Yeah, let's go to my office-

28:43.154 --> 28:46.591
Have a seat there-

28:48.993 --> 28:52.953
I'm more than a little
surprised you asked me here.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.365
We're family.

29:03.341 --> 29:06.709
Joe, listen-..

29:10.014 --> 29:13.348
I've been having dealings

29:13.418 --> 29:14.909
with some oil people
for the past year.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.318
They've been after Daddy to
drill on some land that we own,

29:17.388 --> 29:19.914
but Daddy's
been putting them off-

29:20.024 --> 29:21.959
And it's starting to look like

29:22.026 --> 29:23.551
that we're about
to be passed by-

29:23.661 --> 29:25.811
Now, I was down there
in Mobile having dinner

29:25.846 --> 29:27.962
with a couple of these men,
and I had saw

29:28.032 --> 29:29.967
where they had marked the land
of the most likely places.

29:30.034 --> 29:33.562
Now, we own gosh knows
how many thousands of acres,

29:34.038 --> 29:37.975
but the land
that they most interested in

29:38.042 --> 29:40.534
was right along the sticks.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.604
Have they gone
to the Larkins yet?

29:44.048 --> 29:46.483
No. No-
I put them off that-

29:46.551 --> 29:48.986
Evelyn Larkin is gonna lose
the farm right soon.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.750
If not this summer,
the next-

29:51.856 --> 29:55.020
And I want to make sure that
that land comes to the bank.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.895
Evelyn Larkin came to me
this afternoon.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.593
She wants me to prosecute you
for that murder-

30:02.700 --> 30:06.000
Yeah, I know, Hale told me.
But I don't take it personal.

30:06.070 --> 30:10.007
I mean, God bless her,
she's under a lot of strain.

30:10.074 --> 30:12.009
Which is all the more reason
that we gotta get her out-

30:12.076 --> 30:14.443
We got to be
double careful here-

30:14.546 --> 30:17.015
She's... she's off to see
a lawyer this evening

30:17.081 --> 30:19.915
in Pensacola, some relative
of Warren Perry's.

30:20.418 --> 30:24.014
(laughs )
Warren Perry?

30:24.088 --> 30:27.115
Of course.
He more likely killed that girl.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.353
He's just trying to put
the attention off himself.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.623
You know and I know
there's no lawyer

30:31.729 --> 30:33.755
gonna find something
to put this on you.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.097
But if this guy in Pensacola,
he smells green blood in you,

30:36.901 --> 30:40.360
he can make you some trouble.

30:49.614 --> 30:52.982
When we get back.-.

30:53.117 --> 30:55.814
we're gonna have the man
arrested that did this to you.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.823
We're gonna lift you up
out of this grave..-

31:02.126 --> 31:04.095
and we're gonna stick
Nathan Redfield in your place.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.071
(sobbing )

31:17.375 --> 31:19.037
Man: ( on television )
You're still afraid.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.044
Stop it now!
I mean it!

31:24.782 --> 31:28.378
They're coming to get you,
Barbara.

31:28.453 --> 31:31.617
Barbara:
Stop it-You're ignorant.-.

31:31.689 --> 31:35.023
The store's closing soon-
You want me to go?

31:35.326 --> 31:39.024
'Cause you just finished
off the scotch

31:39.130 --> 31:40.826
and there's no more bourbon.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.494
No, I'll go.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.005
Man: ( on television )
Here he comes now-

31:47.071 --> 31:48.039
I'm getting out of here...

31:48.139 --> 31:49.573
I have to get out anyways.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.940
(spooky music playing )

31:54.012 --> 31:57.312
( woman screams on television )

31:57.715 --> 31:59.081
Johnny! Help me! Help!

32:10.428 --> 32:13.865
(engine starts)

32:13.932 --> 32:15.696
( crossing bell clanging )

32:16.167 --> 32:18.136
( train horn blows)

33:00.144 --> 33:03.171
Ms. Larkin?

33:03.281 --> 33:05.910
Welcome to Pensacola.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.638
( tires squeal)

34:09.514 --> 34:12.973
( tires screech )

34:19.023 --> 34:22.289
It's not much to go on.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.558
But I'll take you on.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.460
(gasps ) Thank you.

34:27.532 --> 34:30.195
I'll request the police
and coroner's reports,

34:30.301 --> 34:32.395
depose the Redfields and anyone
else I deem necessary.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.405
Jerry:
Thank you, Mr. Harp.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.235
I can't tell you how much
that we really appreciate this.

34:36.306 --> 34:40.176
But..- we're gonna
have to talk about

34:40.244 --> 34:42.371
- how much it's gonna cost us-
- This here's pro bono-

34:42.480 --> 34:45.416
(laughs)

34:45.483 --> 34:48.681
Thank you.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.221
- ( door opens)
- Nathan: Ben?

34:50.321 --> 34:53.257
I left the lights on the Scout-
Go turn them off-

34:53.324 --> 34:56.761
Shut the door and lock it.

34:59.197 --> 35:02.224
Now. Go now.

35:02.333 --> 35:05.303
(laughter and chattering
on television)

35:13.077 --> 35:16.241
(door opens )

35:16.347 --> 35:18.976
(door closes)

36:08.633 --> 36:11.933
(door opens )

36:12.003 --> 36:13.699
(door closes)

36:14.305 --> 36:15.329
You see anything
out there?

36:17.775 --> 36:19.767
Looks like you ran through
every mud puddle in town.

36:19.844 --> 36:23.303
What happened?

36:23.414 --> 36:25.713
Oh, there was this young girl
on the street throwing things-

36:27.084 --> 36:28.677
Nathan, why don't...

36:30.421 --> 36:32.049
Listen, I need you to help me
do something.

36:34.292 --> 36:37.285
What is it?

36:39.297 --> 36:42.392
Stay here.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.568
Last time we ate out
was when Margaret

36:46.804 --> 36:49.330
graduated eighth grade
and that waiter spilled

36:49.440 --> 36:51.568
(laughs)
that red wine...

36:51.642 --> 36:52.940
All over
my white shirt, yeah.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.673
( both laugh )

36:55.780 --> 36:59.376
Oh, Margaret
laughed and laughed-

36:59.450 --> 37:01.385
She got a kick out
of that for weeks.

37:01.452 --> 37:04.388
(laughs)

37:06.123 --> 37:09.389
Yeah.

37:14.865 --> 37:18.324
It's okay, Grandma-

37:18.402 --> 37:21.429
I miss her, too-

37:21.539 --> 37:23.531
Help! Help!

37:23.641 --> 37:26.236
Please, help me!

37:26.310 --> 37:27.972
Evelyn:
I don't like this.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.014
Who's out there?

37:32.250 --> 37:35.414
Hey!

37:41.926 --> 37:45.294
Are you okay?

37:46.998 --> 37:50.457
What are you doing out here?

37:54.505 --> 37:57.634
( footsteps)

38:05.449 --> 38:08.419
Jerry!

38:08.552 --> 38:09.850
(screams) Oh!

38:11.856 --> 38:13.449
Oh! Oh!

38:14.725 --> 38:16.990
(grunts)

38:19.430 --> 38:22.867
Nathan,
what are you doing?!

38:24.268 --> 38:25.236
Nathan-

38:36.580 --> 38:40.608
Christ, Nathan, I thought
we were just gonna scare 'em.

38:40.718 --> 38:43.415
They was scared,
all right-

38:43.487 --> 38:44.853
Don't you think?

38:44.955 --> 38:46.423
Get her in the car
before somebody comes.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.425
Up-si-daisy.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.858
Nathan, why you want
to make me do this?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.622
You're gonna help me
get her in the car

38:51.729 --> 38:53.425
or I'm gonna get rid
of three bodies tonight

38:53.497 --> 38:55.625
- all by myself-
- ( grunts)

38:58.769 --> 39:02.467
Come on, darlin',
get in there.

39:07.511 --> 39:11.448
Oh, please, just don't
make me touch the head.

39:12.249 --> 39:15.879
Watch out, boy,
it might bite ya!

39:21.192 --> 39:24.492
Little help, boy.

39:28.666 --> 39:32.364
- One, two-..
- ( grunts )

40:00.898 --> 40:04.733
I don't like any of this.
You didn't tell me...

40:04.835 --> 40:06.861
You can either stay in this car
or get out,

40:06.971 --> 40:08.940
but I don't care,
'cause in ten seconds,

40:09.006 --> 40:10.838
this car is going
off this bluff into the river-

40:33.564 --> 40:37.365
Release the brake
and get out of the car-

40:37.868 --> 40:41.532
And you come around back
and help me

40:41.605 --> 40:43.096
push this thing
over the bluff-

40:54.552 --> 40:58.080
- It's stuck-
- You gotta push-

40:58.189 --> 41:00.215
- All right, ready?
- Go.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.093
- Hold up.
- What?

41:04.628 --> 41:05.652
I forgot the saber.

41:18.642 --> 41:21.840
Oh-..

41:34.892 --> 41:38.488
- What now?
- Nothin'.

41:38.562 --> 41:41.657
Nobody's ever
gonna find that car-

41:46.904 --> 41:50.568
( whispers)
You hear that?

41:53.511 --> 41:56.606
Nobody knows.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.013
They can't even figure out
who killed Margaret,

41:59.116 --> 42:01.381
and that was just
a week ago.

42:01.485 --> 42:04.512
You did kill her.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.614
Didn't you?

42:06.690 --> 42:09.660
Yeah, I did.

42:09.860 --> 42:10.828
But nobody knows it.

42:13.430 --> 42:16.696
And no one's ever gonna know it
unless you tell someone.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.138
Why did you kill her?

42:29.947 --> 42:33.543
How are we gonna get home?

42:33.617 --> 42:36.712
I want to go home now.

42:44.962 --> 42:48.296
Come on, boy.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.268
- That's yours?
- Mm-hmm-

42:52.736 --> 42:54.932
Where'd you get it?

42:55.039 --> 42:56.735
The bank repossessed it-

42:56.840 --> 42:58.832
Get in over there.

43:20.864 --> 43:24.164
Ms. Larkin?

43:24.234 --> 43:26.203
Jerry?

43:44.922 --> 43:48.120
Sheriff-

43:48.425 --> 43:49.586
What are you
doing here, Warren?

43:51.962 --> 43:53.590
I just came to see
how things went

43:53.697 --> 43:55.188
with the Larkins
and my cousin.

43:55.265 --> 43:56.756
He's a lawyer from Pensacola
I set them up with.

43:56.867 --> 43:59.735
I went to check out in the field
and was on my way back

43:59.803 --> 44:02.466
to knock on the door
when I saw...

44:06.644 --> 44:09.808
You see something?

44:09.913 --> 44:12.712
I should really get going.

44:14.785 --> 44:18.153
( car door opens, closes)

44:33.837 --> 44:37.365
Wait till I get out, too.

44:37.474 --> 44:40.603
If you see something, just...
just honk twice, okay?

45:21.285 --> 45:24.722
(doorbell rings)

45:24.822 --> 45:26.450
( inhales deeply)

45:27.725 --> 45:29.660
(laughs)

45:33.464 --> 45:36.957
( Belinda talking
indistinctly)

45:37.034 --> 45:39.970
Well, well.

45:40.037 --> 45:41.403
- Hey, Ted.
- Red.

45:41.505 --> 45:43.940
Hope you're not coming over
here to take Miss Pie away-

45:44.007 --> 45:45.999
I just come out to make sure
you're taking good care of her-

45:46.076 --> 45:48.773
She doesn't get in trouble
when I keep her around me.

45:48.879 --> 45:51.212
More than I can say
for other people in this town-

45:51.315 --> 45:53.784
I hope you're not letting
Miss Pie

45:53.851 --> 45:56.616
ride her wheel out toward
the Styx River bridge.

45:56.687 --> 45:59.452
Belinda don't ride a bicycle,
but if she did,

45:59.523 --> 46:01.355
I wouldn't be letting her
be riding out that way.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.417
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, honey-

46:03.527 --> 46:05.018
You couldn't do without
me for five minutes?

46:05.095 --> 46:06.791
I just come out to see
Nathan for a minute.

46:06.897 --> 46:08.832
Oh, what about?

46:08.899 --> 46:10.162
I don't know.
He asked me to come by.

46:10.234 --> 46:11.862
Hey, there you are.
Hey, come on in.

46:13.704 --> 46:14.672
How are you?

46:16.907 --> 46:18.034
Nathan-

46:18.108 --> 46:19.804
What'd you want
to talk to me about?

46:19.910 --> 46:22.880
Just wanted to talk to you
about Belinda.

46:23.914 --> 46:25.007
What about Belinda?

46:27.284 --> 46:28.775
(sighs) Oh-..

46:29.286 --> 46:30.481
Well..-

46:32.589 --> 46:34.023
it's not anything
directly about her-

46:36.093 --> 46:39.894
It's just something you
may have not have known,

46:39.963 --> 46:41.829
something
I just learned myself.

46:41.932 --> 46:43.798
Uh-huh, what's that?

46:44.101 --> 46:45.592
It's about Warren Perry.

46:47.938 --> 46:49.736
Perry's been hanging
around the house.

46:51.608 --> 46:54.271
He drives by.

46:54.378 --> 46:56.677
I don't know if he thinks
we can't recognize

46:56.747 --> 46:58.875
a blue Rambler
when we seen one.

46:58.949 --> 47:01.418
It's always
when Belinda's here.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.750
He's keeping an eye on her.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.916
Oh, that don't sound
like much.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.653
Yeah, you're right,
it doesn't sound like much.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.059
But it's...
it's not all either.

47:12.129 --> 47:15.566
You know, sometimes
in the evening,

47:15.632 --> 47:17.624
we see him down here walking
along the little stream-

47:18.268 --> 47:22.103
I'm not gonna prosecute
someone for trespassing.

47:23.340 --> 47:27.368
I don't want to worry you,
but I just wanted you to know

47:27.477 --> 47:30.413
so you can keep
an eye on him.

47:34.318 --> 47:38.153
You know how much Belinda
means to all of us,

47:38.255 --> 47:40.918
and especially Daddy.

47:40.991 --> 47:42.926
Lord knows we couldn't go on
if anything ever happened to her

47:42.993 --> 47:45.519
like what happened to that
little Miss Margaret Larkin.

47:48.999 --> 47:49.967
Anything else?

47:52.269 --> 47:54.033
You know,
there was, uh..-

47:54.805 --> 47:55.773
one other little thing.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.734
- Someone broke into our house.
- What?

47:59.810 --> 48:02.075
They stole the sword
that hangs right there

48:02.145 --> 48:04.137
underneath our great-great-
granddaddy's picture.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.479
Somebody broke in, when?
Why didn't you tell me before?

48:06.550 --> 48:09.042
We don't know
when it happened.

48:09.152 --> 48:11.621
It was last night Ben saw
that the sword was gone.

48:11.688 --> 48:14.954
I mean, it couldn't have been
too long ago.

48:15.025 --> 48:17.620
B- but we can't say for sure
because truth be told,

48:17.694 --> 48:20.391
- we just don't go looking at it that often.
- What else is gone?

48:20.497 --> 48:23.262
There's nothing else gone
that we can think of.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.495
That's the funny thing
about it.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.333
I didn't report because
I didn't want to upset Daddy,

48:27.404 --> 48:29.669
telling him that there was
a robber in the house-

48:29.740 --> 48:31.675
And truth be told, Ted,
I just...

48:31.742 --> 48:34.177
I just don't care if I ever see
that sword again-

48:43.487 --> 48:47.185
Let's not say anything
to anybody about this.

48:47.257 --> 48:50.591
There's probably
nothing to it.

48:50.694 --> 48:53.289
You don't think so, huh?

48:53.363 --> 48:56.390
Don't think
there's much to it?

48:56.500 --> 48:59.026
There's no need to go starting
no trouble for Warren.

49:01.071 --> 49:02.664
Now, tell you what.

49:04.541 --> 49:06.339
You got my word
I'll keep an eye on him.

49:06.410 --> 49:09.175
Thanks for the drink.

49:10.247 --> 49:11.738
Keep an eye on your
little girl for you-

49:14.584 --> 49:16.109
(door opens )

49:17.955 --> 49:19.253
She's here,
I take care of her for you, Ted.

49:19.356 --> 49:21.325
(door closes)

49:22.092 --> 49:23.424
( children laughing
and chattering )

49:35.939 --> 49:39.307
( whispers indistinctly)

49:43.113 --> 49:46.948
Hey, want to go see
where she died?

49:52.789 --> 49:56.556
- Where are we going, guys?
- To the bridge.

49:56.626 --> 49:59.221
- To the bridge!
- Shh!

49:59.296 --> 50:01.322
- I don't want to get my
shoes wet. - Then don't-

50:02.733 --> 50:04.065
(all screaming )

50:06.136 --> 50:08.128
Gross!

50:49.179 --> 50:53.116
AIII know is what you
just told me, Sheriff.

50:53.183 --> 50:54.674
I thought Jerry and Ms-Larkin
were in Pensacola.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.118
They were in the back
of their station wagon

50:57.187 --> 50:59.019
under 12 feet of water.

50:59.122 --> 51:00.556
Sheriff-

51:04.061 --> 51:08.157
Looks like that what took
that boy's head off, don't it?

51:08.498 --> 51:12.094
I think you got a case.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.835
Yes, I do-

51:22.179 --> 51:25.377
(sirens wailing )

51:46.436 --> 51:50.203
Pastor:
It is sown in weakness.

51:54.678 --> 51:58.171
It is raised in power.

52:03.019 --> 52:06.387
It is sown a natural body-

52:11.027 --> 52:14.486
It is raised a spiritual body.

52:19.369 --> 52:23.568
Announcer: Sunday Drama is on
the outside grabs the early lead.

52:23.640 --> 52:26.769
(voice becomes distorted )

52:53.637 --> 52:57.335
Nathan: Hey,
little miss blueberry heiress,

52:57.440 --> 53:00.274
you want a ride home?

53:00.343 --> 53:02.676
Will you drop me off
at the bend before the river

53:02.779 --> 53:04.805
so my grandma won't see?

53:04.915 --> 53:06.850
Of course I will.

53:06.917 --> 53:09.546
You mind if we make
a little detour first?

54:47.083 --> 54:50.952
- Margaret: I'm pregnant-
- Nathan: It's not mine.

54:51.054 --> 54:53.148
Margaret:
There's no one else.

54:53.223 --> 54:54.885
If you can get me pregnant,
you can provide for it-

54:54.958 --> 54:57.291
Okay, just give a few days
to break the news to Daddy.

54:57.394 --> 54:59.693
I will do the right thing.

54:59.763 --> 55:01.925
But do not tell a soul
until we make a plan,

55:02.399 --> 55:05.426
you hear me?

55:05.535 --> 55:07.367
I won't.

55:11.408 --> 55:14.867
(air horn blares)

55:44.307 --> 55:47.607
(engine sputtering )

55:48.144 --> 55:51.410
(starter cranking )

59:01.838 --> 59:05.673
There you are. Sorry-
I didn't mean to scare you.

59:10.046 --> 59:13.505
What are you looking at?

59:13.616 --> 59:14.982
Nothing.

59:15.051 --> 59:16.519
Well, I've been keeping Daddy
company all evening.

59:16.619 --> 59:18.747
We've been watching television
and talking.

59:18.821 --> 59:21.814
He kept asking me
what I wanted.

59:21.891 --> 59:24.520
I just didn't feel like
being alone-

59:24.627 --> 59:26.459
Why don't you come up

59:26.529 --> 59:27.656
and sleep in my room
again tonight?

59:27.730 --> 59:30.165
The rollaway bed's
still up there.

59:30.233 --> 59:33.761
Well, all day I've been
half expecting Ted Hale

59:33.870 --> 59:36.533
to drive up with a pair
of handcuffs

59:36.639 --> 59:38.938
in the rearview mirror.

59:39.008 --> 59:41.341
Nobody came.

59:41.411 --> 59:44.040
Nobody called.

59:44.147 --> 59:45.615
Everything's gonna
be all right.

59:46.549 --> 59:47.573
Warren Perry's in jail.

59:49.919 --> 59:52.252
All the attention
focused on him-

59:52.355 --> 59:53.880
They got no reason
to come look at us-

59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.556
In another week,

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.791
you're gonna forget
what really happened.

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:05.960
You'll be like everybody else
in this town,

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.697
think it was Warren Perry
that murdered that old woman

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.296
and Jerry Larkin.

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.931
- You think so?
- Yeah, boy.

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:32.189
Morning-

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:33.251
Morning-

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.831
Picked these up
from your apartment.

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:37.731
Breakfast from the diner.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.634
Thanks, Sheriff.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.603
You okay?

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:48.700
Yeah.

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:53.547
You?

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:55.608
Sheriff.
You're not gonna believe this.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.517
(siren wailing )

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:05.726
I imagine it'd go easier,

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.730
quieter now that they're
not here anymore-

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:10.631
I just want to get another step
between you and me

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:13.567
and the dummy corporation
in Mobile.

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:16.333
I also revised
the loan paperwork,

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.466
made sure that they missed their
payments for the last year.

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:23.068
You know,
Ginny and I are gonna be having

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.637
dinner tonight
at the White Horse.

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.682
Why don't you and Ben come,
make it the four of us?

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.877
We're partners now in this,

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:31.819
and, I don't know,
maybe other things.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:34.686
Feel like you and Ginny
ought to make it up between you.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:37.352
You're right, Ginny and I
ought to make it up-

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:40.295
Though I can't think
of anything that much

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.457
that's been keeping us apart.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.865
Nobody's gonna get hurt with
the deal you and I put together.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:49.099
Ginny's gonna benefit
from it, too.

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:58.976
If their objective
were to steal corpses,

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.074
well, they got that.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:03.676
So why take the time
to destroy the coffins

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:07.746
and spread them halfway
around the cemetery?

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.724
Grave robbers?

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.787
Vandals?

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:17.732
And what do they want
with the corpses?

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.666
Well, I just don't know what
we're gonna do with you, Ben.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:25.474
You're a grown man and you just
don't do a thing in the world.

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:29.501
Nathan, you and I are gonna
have to put our heads together

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.844
and come up with something
that he's good at.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.042
Well, what we need to do
is find someone to pay him

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.914
for lying in the sun 'cause he's
awfully good at that-

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:38.079
You're gonna take that
from him?

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.850
- Ben: He's kinda right.
- (laughs)

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:42.391
Strawberry shortcake and
supreme apple pie Ã  la mode-

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.859
Thank you, darlin'-

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.589
Ginny: Well, it's only
a matter of time

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.324
before you
have to go to work.

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.990
Ben:
Well, I guess so.

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:04.007
Nathan? You okay?

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:14.781
Nathan!

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:20.463
(echoing ) Is there anything
I can get you, sir?

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:30.670
Everything all right...
( grunts)

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.575
I'm sorry,
I think it's his medication.

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:38.979
We got to get
out of here.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:44.342
( water running )

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.446
Why did you throttle
that girl?

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.855
Ben, sit here.

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:53.257
( water stops)

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.798
(steps into tub)

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:13.810
Think you really
ought have it that hot?

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:16.112
Can't be good for you.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:18.677
I gotta get rid of
the tenseness in my joints.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:27.522
- What's wrong?
- What?

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:30.900
What's wrong?

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.830
- What are you talking about?
- What are you looking at?

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:37.736
Nothing, I'm not looking
at a blessed thing.

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:07.926
How you feel about
going to Duval

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.939
for the rest of the summer?

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:11.941
Just you and me.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:19.582
It's time to rest,

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.180
everything
that's happened and all.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:28.919
Think I'd like that.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.560
What's Daddy gonna say?

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.796
Belinda?

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:43.065
I've been calling-
Honey?

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:46.873
( telephone rings)

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:49.444
Belinda?

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:50.638
Man:
Sheriff Hale?

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.044
Yes.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.885
This is Derek
from Mobile Energy-

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.888
I know it's kinda of late,
but, uh, we've been offshore.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.891
I received your message
and felt

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.086
it was kinda of an emergency,
so I figured I'd try you.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.558
Yes, um..-

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.122
I'm investing a murder
and, uh.-.

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:13.896
was wondering when's the
last time you might've spoken

01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:18.066
to Evelyn Larkin?

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.939
Oh,
it's been some time now.

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:23.638
We've been dealing
with her representative.

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:26.239
And, uh,
who might that be?

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:30.145
A gentleman
named Nathan Redfield.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.649
I'm worried about Mr. Red-

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.114
You got every right
in the world to be worried.

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:39.525
Why?
Wait, do you think he...

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.086
Yeah.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.098
You are just telling me
this now?

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:45.634
I didn't have enough
to go on, Ginny.

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:47.363
Nathan just about ripped
that girl's shoulders

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.928
off her back in front
of 40 paying customers.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.498
Looked like he was ready
to do worse.

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.304
So, yeah-Now.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.938
(laughs) He's splashing
me with water.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.109
Daddy, we gotta talk
for a minute.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:05.386
Y'all just get back?

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:06.979
Yeah, we gotta talk
to Daddy for a bit.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.957
But you can't stay 'cause
we gotta talk private.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.052
What are you trying to say to me
that Miss Pie can't hear?

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:14.960
Daddy, we gotta talk
family stuff.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.296
Don't really interest
Belinda that much.

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.392
I never heard of such
secret goings-on-

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.835
But I'm gonna try
my new bathing suit.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:31.441
Daddy, Ben and I are gonna
go to Duval

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.973
for the rest of the summer.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.986
You can't do it.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.146
You're president
of the bank.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.987
You begged me
to make you president,

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.254
and now you're coming
in here telling me

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.158
you're gonna take off?!

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.561
In the middle
of the yearly audit?

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:50.860
And the leave the place
to rack and ruin?!

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:52.935
The bank is not gonna go
to rack and ruin.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.497
- Just so tired, Daddy.
- You don't look tired.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.199
You know what kind of tired
I'm talking about.

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.608
You mean you're about
to have a nervous breakdown,

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:06.980
and that's why you're
going to Duval?

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:09.018
( mocking laugh )

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.451
We just gotta get out
of here for a bit.

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.249
You up to something?

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:15.483
What's he up to, Ben?

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.322
Ben, why don't you go
check on Belinda?

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:34.038
You go away to Duval

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.477
or wherever it is
you're really going.

01:08:38.046 --> 01:08:39.572
But I'm gonna appoint
a new president.

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.912
You won't ever set foot
in CPM again.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:47.716
Now, you go off-
You will never see me again.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.389
You will never see
a penny...

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.093
of my money.

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.234
You understand?

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:13.242
I don't want you
to catch a chill, Daddy.

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:48.345
( water dripping )

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.329
Nathan: "I have been sick
for the past two years,

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:05.060
and there's no hope
of me ever getting any better,

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.968
constantly tortured
with pain in my spine,

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:12.668
and it has become
unbearable.

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:16.143
I want to thank Nina

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.044
and Belinda Hale
for nursing me-

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.308
If it hadn't been for them,

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.180
I would've killed myself
a long time ago-

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.184
Nathan,
when you read this,

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.348
I want you to make
provisions for both of them

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:32.155
out of the money
I have left you-

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:35.323
Fix it so that Nina doesn't
ever have to work again,

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:39.266
and see to it that Miss Pie

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.337
can go to any nursing school
that she wants."

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:59.252
( off-the-hook alert beeping )

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.880
Ginny's on the way over
right now

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:02.288
with Nina to get Mr. Red
out of the house.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.486
Nathan's got something
pressing on his brain.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.893
So we just thought it best
to get Mr-Red out of there.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:09.124
If Belinda's there,
does Ginny know enough

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:11.257
- to get her out, too?
- She'll get her out.

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.199
Oh, I don't like this.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.567
(door opens )

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.270
- ( door closes )
- Red: Who's there?

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:25.203
Miss Pie?
( yelps)

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.772
Shh! Mr-Red, I got
to get you out of here.

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:29.545
- What are you...
- You think I ask you to come away with me

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.213
in the dark
if I just didn't have to?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.052
- You need to hurry!
- What?

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:54.771
Ginny?

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.243
- Shh!
- Don't you worry about a thing-

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.144
We're gonna get you
right back here

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.612
just as soon as we can.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.681
(van doors close)

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:06.919
Miss Pie-

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:14.390
( humming tune )

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.261
Well, well.

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.670
(giggles softly)

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.206
Miss Pie-

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:34.181
Nathan, what the hell
do you think you're doing?!

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.215
Damn it.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:40.281
Ow.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.450
Damn it, Nathan-

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:45.494
You hurt me.

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.426
You st...
I thought you were...

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:49.590
You thought what?
What, that I was a burglar?

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:53.299
How many burglars
do you see

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:56.269
wearing a two-piece
bathing suit?

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.330
( chuckles)

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:01.273
I'm sorry.

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.834
Come on, let's go back out
by the pool.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:05.073
We've been in for a while.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:13.322
You can see why I need
a little vacation, huh?

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:16.315
(siren wailing )

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.658
Right here, that's them.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:26.165
- ( siren dies)
- Where's Belinda?

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.500
- You know what Nathan did?
- Did you bring Belinda out with you?

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.267
Nina: She's over there
in the pool.

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.069
I couldn't get to her
without them seeing.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.003
But I know that she's okay,
I know that she is.

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:37.446
You think I should go
check on Mr. Red,

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:41.316
you know, make sure
he's doing all right?

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.318
Oh, he's probably asleep.

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.320
Besides he'd talk you into
sitting up there with him,

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.413
I want you all
to myself, darlin'.

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:50.891
Ben, why don't you go get me
and Belinda a drink?

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:55.328
Get one for yourself,
too, bud-

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:22.550
- Want to see my new dive?
- What?

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:27.924
(laughs)

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.828
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't
live with myself

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.367
if I didn't do that.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.027
I just had to get you back.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.537
But I promise I'll be good to
you for the rest of the evening.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:17.177
What's the matter,
you can't hold your breath?

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.664
Nathan!

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:55.312
Nathan!

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:42.790
I want you to go up
to the front door,

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.696
but I want you
to go real slow.

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.701
I'm gonna run around back.

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.527
Let's go.

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:24.502
(engine starts)

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:27.735
( tires squeal)

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.057
(screams, grunts)

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:09.945
Are you... okay, honey.
It's okay, honey.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:14.487
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:18.415
You're gonna be okay.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.860
( panicked grunting )

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:09.298
No!

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:21.547
(voices whispering
indistinctly)

01:20:57.819 --> 01:21:01.119
How's Belinda?

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:03.681
Well, she's gonna need
some reconstructive surgery,

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:07.490
but she's gonna be all right.

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:11.028
You discharge Warren?

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.761
Yes, sir.
First thing this morning.

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:26.748
How in the hell did he get
in that position?

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:36.613
He's missing an ear-

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:37.954
Man:
Uh, Sheriff?

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:42.325
Sheriff, you might wanna
look at this.
