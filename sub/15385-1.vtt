"Possum Gully, Australia, 1897.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.285
"Dear Fellow Countrymen,

01:17.369 --> 01:20.788
'Just a few lines to let you know...

Sybylla!

03:19.950 --> 03:22.451
Go on, then. Take that
in the house for Mother.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.328
Go on!
Get in the house!

03:27.708 --> 03:29.750
Sybylla!

03:32.963 --> 03:34.881
Secure the windows!

03:37.426 --> 03:39.635
Sybylla!

03:41.388 --> 03:43.389
Get out here!

03:46.977 --> 03:48.978
I'm coming!

05:41.258 --> 05:44.552
Sybylla, I want to have
a talk with you.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.096
Talk away.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.819
You're a young woman now,

06:01.903 --> 06:03.571
and-

06:05.657 --> 06:09.827
I have been thinking about this
a great deal.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.830
We can't afford to keep you
any longer.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.712
Do you think you could
earn your own living?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.297
Of course.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.591
And how would you do that?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.387
I'd like to be a pianist.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.224
Oh, Sybylla.
That takes years of practice.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.811
You know we can't afford it. You've
thought of something already, haven't you?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.815
I've arranged a position for you.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.026
A position?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.944
As a general servant.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.531
Servant?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.993
I won't.
We have no choice.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.413
You just want to get rid of me.
I must do what I feel is right!

06:54.498 --> 06:56.624
Oh, I prayed to God
for guidance.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.959
And this is what
he told you to do?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.003
God be damned!

07:04.382 --> 07:08.344
It's a wonder God didn't
strike her dead at my feet.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.764
Same as all your damned family.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.974
Delusions of grandeur.

07:17.813 --> 07:23.275
To have such a daughter-
useless, plain and godless.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.361
What can I do?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.452
I want to do great things, Gertie,

07:33.537 --> 07:35.871
not be a servant.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.416
I hate this life.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.378
Should never have left
the mountains.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.964
It's not Father's fault.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.386
You can't blame him for the drought.

07:52.097 --> 07:56.642
Gertie, don't you ever dream
there's more to life than this?

07:56.726 --> 08:01.063
Don't you want to meet people
who talk about books and words...

08:01.148 --> 08:03.899
and have visions?

08:06.945 --> 08:09.780
Gertie, I can't settle
for a new dress,

08:09.865 --> 08:11.782
a picnic now and then.

08:13.535 --> 08:17.163
Living out in the bush for the rest of
my life, I might just as well be dead.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.165
Don't say things like that.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.168
Well, why doesn't Mother
understand?

08:22.252 --> 08:23.836
Why doesn't anyone?

08:23.920 --> 08:28.048
I think you're the nicest, cleverest girl
in the whole entire world.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.176
I'm not.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.178
I'm mad.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.264
It'd be better if I didn't think at all.

08:38.268 --> 08:42.813
It's no use for me.
I've no training, no money.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.900
I haven't any time
to study or practice.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.987
Just two states of existence-

08:50.071 --> 08:52.072
work and sleep.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.244
Sybylla!

08:59.706 --> 09:03.459
Sybylla, why do you never answer
when I call?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.547
I want you to fetch your father.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.062
It's all right.
I'll do it.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.169
Looking for your dad, are ya?

09:48.672 --> 09:51.382
Just missed him.
Left with the schoolmaster.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.759
Blind leading the blind!

09:53.843 --> 09:55.469
As usual!

10:07.357 --> 10:09.024
Come on.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.279
Hup! Hup! Come on.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.435
I've had a letter
from your grandmother.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.520
You'd better read it!

10:54.321 --> 10:59.158
Says she's sorry to hear you're such
a source of grief and annoyance...

10:59.242 --> 11:03.162
and thinks you might be in danger
of forming ties beneath you here.

11:04.748 --> 11:08.792
Oh, Syb, you're to go
to Gran at Caddagat!

11:13.923 --> 11:16.759
Gertie!

11:32.609 --> 11:35.361
Good day! Good day, Jack! How are ya?

11:52.253 --> 11:55.172
Go on.
Good day, Bill!

11:55.256 --> 11:58.050
Good day, Jack.
Had a good trip?

11:58.134 --> 12:01.136
Fine, Bill, just fine.
Not a bad run at all.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.110
I say, driver.
Yes, sir?

12:16.236 --> 12:20.072
I believe Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter was
supposed to have been on the coach. Oh! That's me!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
Thank you, Jack.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.707
- Hello.
- Miss Melvyn?

12:30.792 --> 12:33.627
Yes. Where's Uncle J.J.?

12:33.711 --> 12:35.504
Um, he's away.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.673
On business.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.800
I'm Frank Hawden.

12:39.884 --> 12:43.011
- What are you?
- Ajackaroo.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.515
That's poetry.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.810
Yes.
Thank you.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.520
See you next week, then.
Bye.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.355
Bye-bye, Jack!
Bye, missy.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.277
Go on.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.363
Bye!

13:12.208 --> 13:16.086
You're a new chum,
aren't you? Certainly not.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.131
I've been in the colony
well over three months. Oh.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.425
Still wet behind the ears.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.599
I was surprised back there...

13:28.683 --> 13:30.684
at your being
Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.561
Really?
Yes.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.565
I mean, you're not at all like them,
Mrs. Bossier or your aunt, Mrs. Bell.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.567
They're so awfully
good-looking.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.736
Indeed!
Yes.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.865
But never mind. You seem like a
good sort. We'll have some fun.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.327
Well, I'm glad I meet with
your approval, Mr. Hawden,

13:48.411 --> 13:49.912
in even a small degree.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.920
Caddagat!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.598
Hello! We're here!

14:21.569 --> 14:24.738
Sybylla!
Welcome, my dear!

14:24.822 --> 14:27.699
Welcome!
Oh, Grandma.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.411
Sybylla.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.432
I remember this!

14:52.517 --> 14:54.101
Oh!

15:03.695 --> 15:06.822
For the gracious bounties
we are about to receive...

15:06.906 --> 15:09.866
may the good Lord
make us truly thankful.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.827
Amen.
Amen.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.688
Take some more, dear.

15:49.741 --> 15:53.660
Will this be sufficient for
you, Frank? Yes, thank you.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.585
Thank you, Mrs. Bossier.

16:21.147 --> 16:25.275
Helen, have you seen any patterns
in the catalog you like?

16:25.360 --> 16:29.321
Well, there were two, yes.
Yes, I bought two lovely ones for Sybylla.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.239
That's a good idea.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.408
What color, do you think?

16:33.493 --> 16:36.411
Oh, sky blue.
Or pretty pink?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.664
And what would you like,
Sybylla?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.290
Lemon.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.328
Thank you, dear.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.919
But, Helen,
you look so beautiful.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.339
Don't you recognize
your own mother?

17:29.424 --> 17:32.175
This was her room
when she was young.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.181
We'll see you in the morning.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.684
Sleep well.
Good night.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.388
Now...

19:00.473 --> 19:02.474
what's all this about?

19:04.727 --> 19:06.311
Mother-

19:06.395 --> 19:08.188
Mother.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.652
And I'm so ugly.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.404
Nobody loves me.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.573
Oh, Sybylla.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.036
Stop all this
and into bed with you.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.746
Come along.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.808
I don't understand you, Sybylla.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.939
There's-There's any amount of love
and good in the world, you know.

19:52.692 --> 19:57.404
But it doesn't just come to you.
You have to search for it.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.366
Being misunderstood...

20:01.450 --> 20:03.869
is a trial we must all bear.

20:06.581 --> 20:12.252
You have a-a wildness of spirit which is
going to get you into trouble all your life.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.840
So you must learn to control it.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.843
And try and cultivate
a little more feminine vanity.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.344
Oh, I've given up.

20:21.429 --> 20:25.098
Plain looks never stopped
anyone from being...

20:25.182 --> 20:28.435
intelligent or witty or-
or making friends.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.230
Being beautiful is...

20:32.315 --> 20:34.733
no guarantee of success
in anything.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.986
But it does help a little.

20:40.865 --> 20:44.367
I have a plan. You'll never
make me more than middling ugly.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.913
We'll see. But first of all,
no more looking in mirrors.

20:57.632 --> 20:59.591
And no more thinking
about yourself.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.192
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine,

21:18.402 --> 21:19.611
eighty,

21:19.695 --> 21:23.698
eighty-one, eighty-two,

21:23.783 --> 21:27.285
eighty-three, eighty-four,

21:27.370 --> 21:32.248
eighty-five, eighty-six,
eighty-seven-

21:43.344 --> 21:46.763
"I had a dove,
and the sweet dove died,

21:46.847 --> 21:49.766
"and I could have thought
it died of grieving.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.851
Oh, who could it grieve for?"

22:14.458 --> 22:16.334
Mr. Hawden!

22:16.419 --> 22:17.877
Frank.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.548
How terribly kind.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.591
Not at all!

22:48.200 --> 22:50.577
Rain!

23:16.812 --> 23:21.441
Now you see the consequences
ofwild and extravagant behavior.

23:21.525 --> 23:25.195
You'd have done the same if you hadn't
seen decent rain for over a year.

23:25.279 --> 23:29.240
Well, a few days in bed
will keep you out of mischief.

23:29.325 --> 23:32.410
Harry has brought you some apples
all the way from Five Bob Downs.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.162
You remember Harry, dear?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.081
Oh, Podgy?

23:36.165 --> 23:40.502
Sybylla! Harry and Miss Augusta are the
most important people in the district!

23:40.586 --> 23:45.507
Too good for me then. I'm only good for
the local boy who has pimples and stinks.

23:46.509 --> 23:51.262
I shall make quite sure my granddaughter
will never marry a man unworthy of her.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.264
Don't worry.
I don't.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.351
I'm not marrying anyone.
I'm going to have a career.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.855
A career. What in?

24:01.732 --> 24:04.984
Mmm, literature, music, art.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.861
Maybe the opera.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.947
I've not made up my mind yet.

24:18.541 --> 24:22.460
I fear, Helen, we underestimated
her mother's problem.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.004
I wish Julius were here.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.257
She needs a man's hand.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.969
Ethel.
Yes, ma'am?

24:31.053 --> 24:34.222
Take this to
the kitchen, please.

24:55.661 --> 24:59.164
 Maggie Piggins on the wall
Maggie Piggins going to fall 

24:59.248 --> 25:00.790
 Maggie Piggins very tall 

25:00.875 --> 25:02.959
 Maggie Piggins dancin' 

25:03.043 --> 25:07.589
 Maggie Piggins had the coo
Brown and white within the brew 

25:07.673 --> 25:09.841
 Open the gate
and let him through 

25:09.925 --> 25:11.926
 Maggie Piggins in tr- 

25:16.682 --> 25:20.518
Do you, um, need a hand?

25:20.603 --> 25:22.270
No, thank you.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.858
You're, uh, new here, aren't you?

25:26.942 --> 25:29.652
Do you work in the kitchen?

25:29.737 --> 25:33.198
I'd be obliged to you, sir,
if you'd take yourself out of the way,

25:33.282 --> 25:36.075
unless you want me foot
in your big, fat face.

25:43.959 --> 25:48.463
How about, um, a reward?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.215
Let me go.

25:56.639 --> 25:59.265
You should be ashamed.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.684
A gentleman like yourself...

26:01.769 --> 26:04.270
peepin' and pryin'
on innocent girls.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.774
You'll have me sacked, you will.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.117
What's your name?

26:19.161 --> 26:21.246
Wouldn't you like to know!

26:43.060 --> 26:45.270
Ah, it's a picture, you are!

26:45.354 --> 26:47.897
Can't I look now?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.691
What do you think, Biddy?

26:49.775 --> 26:52.443
Well, ma'am, I don't think
the glass'll break.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.114
Biddy!

27:03.372 --> 27:06.582
I hope you can say something
to your Uncle Julius.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.543
Uncle J.J.?
He's not here!

27:10.671 --> 27:12.297
Thank you, Aunt Helen.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.923
It's beautiful.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.052
Oh, Sybylla!

27:18.137 --> 27:20.054
There she is!

27:20.139 --> 27:22.056
Uncle J.J.!

27:24.143 --> 27:26.060
Here.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.564
By George,
you're a good-looking young lady!

27:31.191 --> 27:33.609
Ah. You've changed,
no doubt about that.

27:33.694 --> 27:37.864
You haven't. Your kisses
still smell ofwhiskey and cigars.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.325
That's what makes 'em irresistible.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.580
Ah, come in, gentlemen!

27:45.664 --> 27:47.206
Hello, Harry.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.001
Hello, Mrs. Bossier. I'm delighted
you could join us this evening.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.675
Well, for goodness' sake, Frank,
get him a drink!

28:01.096 --> 28:05.183
Sybylla, this is our dear friend,
Harry Beecham.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.435
Harry, you remember
my granddaughter.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.355
Uh, y-yes, Miss Melvyn.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.023
I...

28:12.107 --> 28:14.025
never would have recognized you.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.319
No, nor I, Mr. Beecham.

28:18.655 --> 28:22.909
I believe I have to thank you for the
apples you sent to me when I was ill.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.830
And Frank's very good at giving me flowers.
Aren't you, Frank?

28:30.959 --> 28:32.960
Y- Yes.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.552
Well, the drought up country's
not broken yet, Harry.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.555
Saw a lot of unfortunate fellows
on the road heading south.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.558
Yes, we've noticed more
calling in here for food recently.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.477
Very bad. Very bad.

28:50.687 --> 28:54.148
Yes, I was approached
by one of them today.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.192
A very ill-mannered sort.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.070
While I was picking blossom.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.823
Goodness, dear!
He was very forward.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.409
He wanted to kiss me.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.412
You should have called me.
I'd have taken care of him.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.748
I'm sure you would.
But I can look after myself, Frank.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.375
Good girl!

29:12.459 --> 29:14.544
That's the sort we want.
Eh, Harry?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.422
Absolutely.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.090
Thank you, Ethel.

29:19.174 --> 29:23.052
I fear Mrs. Hickey's decided that now is
an appropriate time to have her baby.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.388
I promised to help.
Excuse me.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.558
Mother, can't I go?
No, no, dear. No.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.935
Enjoy yourselves.
Good night.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.271
Good night, Mother.
Good night.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.319
Sybylla.
Thank you.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.203
Are you finished?

29:49.288 --> 29:52.290
Would you like some more, Helen?
Yes. Thanks, Julius.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.668
There you are, Harry.
Help yourself.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.047
Ah, your turn for a song, Harry.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.884
I don't know any.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.802
Oh, I can give you a song.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.434
 There were
three drunken maidens 

30:53.519 --> 30:55.061
 Down the Isle ofWight 

30:55.145 --> 30:56.646
 They drunk from Sunday morning 

30:56.730 --> 30:58.564
 Nor stopped for Saturday night 

30:58.649 --> 31:00.399
 Then Saturday night
did come around 

31:00.484 --> 31:02.318
 The girls
they wouldn't go home 

31:02.402 --> 31:05.863
 And those three drunken maidens
pushed the jug about 

31:05.948 --> 31:09.534
- Where on earth did you learn that?
- In the pub, of course.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.786
 Then where are
all your feathered hats 

31:11.870 --> 31:13.996
 Your clothes so rich and fine 

31:14.081 --> 31:17.375
 They've all been swallowed up, boys
in tankards of good wine 

31:17.459 --> 31:19.252
 And where are
all your maidenheads 

31:19.378 --> 31:21.504
 Your maidens rich and fine  Our
Sybylla appears to have hidden talents.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.549
The only trouble is,
you don't know what she'll do next.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.676
I seem to recall
she was always like this.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.724
Sorry, Frank.
I loved it.

31:44.861 --> 31:49.448
From what I hear, Julius, last night
was little short of a bacchanalian debauch.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.868
What? Oh, who told you
that, Mother? Ask Helen.

31:52.953 --> 31:55.371
She has one of her sick headaches.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.376
Sybylla.
Good morning, Grandma.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.461
Good morning, Uncle J.J.
Morning.

32:02.546 --> 32:05.131
- Harry?
- He left early.

32:08.677 --> 32:13.055
I gather your behavior last night,
young lady, left a lot to be desired.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.851
I'd have said Harry enjoyed himself.
That's not what I heard.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.686
Excuse me.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.983
Anyway, Syb solved
one problem last night.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.110
Indeed.
Her future.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.571
She should be an actress.

32:28.655 --> 32:32.033
Are you suggesting my granddaughter
should be an actress?

32:32.117 --> 32:35.036
She has a talent for it.
I could introduce her-

32:35.120 --> 32:36.579
Go on the stage?

32:36.663 --> 32:41.917
I'd rather see her with her hair shorn off
and shut up in a convent.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.045
Don't ever mention
the subject again.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.663
I enjoyed meself last night.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.749
I thought we got on
jolly well together. Didn't you?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.670
Miss Melvyn-Ahh!

33:25.754 --> 33:27.505
Sybylla.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.256
I've been thinking.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.258
While looks aren't everything,
and, um-

33:31.343 --> 33:33.928
Would you come
to the point, Frank?

33:34.012 --> 33:36.931
Well, now that this-
this fellow Harry has gone,

33:37.015 --> 33:38.933
you should pay some heed
to my attentions.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.061
Do you mean your attentions
or your intentions?

33:42.145 --> 33:45.231
At the conclusion of the coming year
I will be returning to England,

33:45.315 --> 33:48.234
and I expect you
to return with me as my wife.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.779
Well, what do you say?
Oh, let me go.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.407
Not until I have your answer.

34:10.424 --> 34:14.719
Well, there is this in your favor - You
don't say you're sorry when you are not.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.888
Why should I pretend
about a person like Frank Hawden?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.974
But you are not prepared
to apologize?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.434
What for?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.562
Your aunt and I thought that
you liked him. Liked him?

34:24.688 --> 34:27.940
He appears to be
extremely fond of you.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.942
Now listen to me, Sybylla.

34:30.025 --> 34:33.027
In a few years he'll come into
quite a large fortune in England.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.741
He comes of a very good family
and will make someone an excellent husband.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.492
Well, it won't be me!

34:38.577 --> 34:41.411
Oh, do be realistic, child.
Well, I am!

34:41.496 --> 34:43.706
To begin with, I don't love him.

34:43.831 --> 34:47.251
That is not the point.
Well, it is to me.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.545
Sybylla, do you want to be
a burden on your family forever...

34:50.630 --> 34:53.466
with no status in decent society
or a home of your own?

34:53.550 --> 34:58.053
I will not be married off
to someone I detest, by you or anybody!

34:59.473 --> 35:01.807
At times I fear for you, my girl.

35:01.892 --> 35:06.896
You are rude to your elders and betters
and often lack all gentility.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.859
Very well.

35:14.029 --> 35:17.072
Though you may not be prepared
to apologize to Frank,

35:17.157 --> 35:19.241
I expect you to apologize to me...

35:20.118 --> 35:23.537
when you have regained
your... humor...

35:23.622 --> 35:25.289
and your manners.

35:35.300 --> 35:39.094
You must learn not to shout
at your grandmother, Sybylla.

35:39.179 --> 35:41.263
I didn't mean to.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.934
It just surges up in me
when she starts on about marriage.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.936
She just doesn't seem
to understand.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.146
Sit down here next to me.

35:49.231 --> 35:50.606
Come on.

35:54.110 --> 35:58.405
Now, believe me, Sybylla,
the best kind of marriage...

35:58.490 --> 36:01.951
is not love marriage
but friendship marriage.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.869
Friendship?
Yes.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.707
You see,

36:08.792 --> 36:10.918
your mother married for love.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.423
And...

36:16.508 --> 36:18.175
I too...

36:19.386 --> 36:21.053
married for love.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.393
My husband isn't dead.

36:29.062 --> 36:32.439
He-He left me
for someone else.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.695
Left me to live
the rest of my life with the-

36:37.779 --> 36:42.199
the shame of being
neither wife nor widow...

36:42.284 --> 36:43.868
nor maid.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.788
But why should you be ashamed?

36:49.374 --> 36:52.751
Marriage gives us respectability,
dear, as you'll learn.

36:52.836 --> 36:56.046
No, that is just
what men want us to believe.

36:56.131 --> 36:59.550
Stupid idiots like-
like Frank Hawden.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.636
Well, I won't be caught up in it,
not by him or anyone.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.897
Aunt Helen, please.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.983
Please stop trying
to marry me off.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.488
Well, I suppose I should...

37:24.409 --> 37:27.828
tear up this invitation, then,
from Miss Augusta...

37:28.830 --> 37:30.998
for you to stay a few days
at Five Bob.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.920
Shall I?

37:36.004 --> 37:38.839
No!

37:47.515 --> 37:50.684
I hear you've made a lot of changes
at Five Bob, Mr. Beecham.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.689
Oh, yes, we have.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.778
Must have been hard for you
when your father died.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.741
Can I drive?

38:46.908 --> 38:48.909
Whoa, boy, whoa.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.753
Dear Lucy's daughter.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.463
There's little resemblance.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.591
No. I'm sorry.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.261
A pity.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.222
Well, come in.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.894
Come along, child.
I'm not going to eat you.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.405
Well, I think I'll turn in.

40:09.783 --> 40:12.326
Early start tomorrow.
Good night, Aunt Gussie.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.744
Good night, dear.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.663
Good night, Miss Melvyn.
Good night, Mr. Beecham.

40:26.841 --> 40:30.719
He always seems so quiet
and composed.

40:30.804 --> 40:33.013
You don't have to live with him.

40:36.643 --> 40:40.979
This must be the most
beautiful house in the world.

40:41.064 --> 40:44.691
Too big.
Too many corners to dust.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.903
Fancy living in it, do you?

40:47.987 --> 40:51.448
No. I'd get lost.

40:51.533 --> 40:54.409
I wouldn't know what to do
with all those servants.

40:54.494 --> 40:57.496
I wouldn't even know
what groceries to order.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.419
I think another glass of port
won't harm us.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.392
Beautiful creatures.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.645
They're fortunate, aren't they?

41:21.729 --> 41:24.439
Every day they get their food.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.525
As long as I remember.

41:30.363 --> 41:34.700
They never have to look for water
in a dried-up creek,

41:38.371 --> 41:40.372
scratch for a living...

41:42.834 --> 41:45.043
like all our countrymen.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.045
Forced on the road to beg.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.632
Perhaps they are meant to
counterbalance the ugly things of life.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.318
Do you read the Australian poets,
Miss Gussie?

42:28.922 --> 42:34.009
You know, I think ugly girls should be
strangled at birth by their parents.

42:34.093 --> 42:38.013
It's bad enough being born a girl,
but being born ugly and clever-

42:38.097 --> 42:40.766
Oh. Clever, are you?

42:40.850 --> 42:42.559
Well, I hope so.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.561
I'm done for if I'm not.

42:44.646 --> 42:46.980
Has to be something I'm good at.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.275
There's sure to be.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.079
Cool breezes ripples
at the river below...

43:02.163 --> 43:05.457
as fleecy clouds float high...

43:05.541 --> 43:09.419
and I mark how
the dark green gum trees match...

43:09.504 --> 43:12.881
the bright blue vault of the sky.

43:12.966 --> 43:17.719
We wouldn't be out of place
on the Thames in England.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.222
I haven't done this for years.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.622
Oh!
Sybylla!

44:31.127 --> 44:32.836
Race you home!

44:47.685 --> 44:49.728
You didn't stay long
at the river.

44:49.854 --> 44:54.149
You washed your hair.
That will never dry by dinner.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.235
Perhaps I should cut it
all off. Well, no, dear.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.864
It'd be a pity to lose
your finest asset.

45:00.948 --> 45:03.033
My only asset, more like.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.786
Oh, I wouldn't go
quite as far as that.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.376
It must be contagious.

45:12.502 --> 45:15.128
What's that?
Washing one's hair.

45:16.255 --> 45:19.383
Or did you, by chance,
have an accident at the river?

45:19.467 --> 45:22.469
No, no. I don't wish
to hear the details.

45:23.805 --> 45:28.850
Well, as you both seem able
to entertain yourselves,

45:28.935 --> 45:30.685
I'll see to dinner.

45:42.782 --> 45:46.326
I was worried when I couldn't see you
when I came to the surface.

45:47.703 --> 45:49.704
I thought
you might have drowned.

45:49.789 --> 45:52.833
What a terrible loss to the world.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.002
Yes, it would have been.

46:50.766 --> 46:53.018
Good night, Miss Melvyn.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.769
Good night, Mr. Beecham.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.282
Thank you.

50:37.451 --> 50:39.452
Coffee?

50:44.458 --> 50:46.751
Well?

50:46.836 --> 50:49.170
She was a precocious child.

50:49.255 --> 50:52.632
There's an improvement,
but not much.

50:53.801 --> 50:56.094
Still skinny.

50:59.473 --> 51:03.143
She's very young, Harry,
and spirited.

51:04.729 --> 51:07.021
Take care.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.149
Don't rush anything.

51:10.860 --> 51:14.028
Very good.

51:14.113 --> 51:17.574
Peddle a little faster.
Yes, a little faster.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.285
Very good.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.251
How long will you be away?

51:28.377 --> 51:31.171
Oh, quite a few weeks.

51:31.297 --> 51:33.506
I've got to go to the Queensland
property first... Oh, God.

51:33.591 --> 51:36.092
And then to the shearing
at the Riverina.

51:36.177 --> 51:38.178
Wait a minute.

51:51.025 --> 51:53.526
I'll come over and see you
as soon as I get back.

51:55.988 --> 51:57.989
There.

52:03.329 --> 52:05.205
There we are.

52:05.331 --> 52:08.917
Well, safe home.
Thank you, Gussie.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.877
Bye-bye, J.J.
Bye, Harry.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.337
Good-bye, J.J.
Good-bye, my dear.

52:12.463 --> 52:16.132
You be careful with that bicycle,
do you hear? I will. Bye-bye!

52:17.259 --> 52:19.260
Bye-bye.

52:41.659 --> 52:45.537
 Last night as I lay sleeping 

52:45.621 --> 52:49.332
 There came a dream so fair 

52:49.416 --> 52:53.002
 I stood in old Jerusalem 

52:53.087 --> 52:57.048
 Beside the temple there 

52:57.132 --> 53:00.510
 I heard the children singing 

53:00.594 --> 53:04.013
 And ever as they sang 

53:04.098 --> 53:07.684
 Me thought the voice of angels 

53:07.768 --> 53:11.229
 From heaven in answer rang 

53:11.313 --> 53:17.694
 Me thought the voice of angels 

53:17.778 --> 53:24.325
 From heaven in answer rang 

53:24.410 --> 53:32.166
 Jerusalem 

53:32.251 --> 53:37.630
 Lift up your voice and sing 

53:37.715 --> 53:40.925
 Hosanna 

53:41.010 --> 53:44.095
 In the highest 

53:44.179 --> 53:50.643
 Hosanna to your king  

53:54.982 --> 53:58.026
It must have been pretty quiet
for you at Five Bob.

53:58.110 --> 54:01.029
Oh, I survived.

54:41.070 --> 54:44.155
Mmm. Such a heavenly scent.

54:44.239 --> 54:47.158
Really, Sybylla, must you play
those vulgar songs?

54:47.284 --> 54:50.286
There are so many nice ones,
aren't there?

54:53.958 --> 54:56.125
Here you are.

54:56.251 --> 54:59.087
That should keep you going
for a while.

54:59.213 --> 55:01.172
Thank you.
Good-bye. Good luck.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.257
You too.

55:03.342 --> 55:07.178
We'll have to watch her, Helen. She'll give
away half of Caddagat to those fellows.

55:10.891 --> 55:14.268
Can't something be
done for them? You see?

55:14.353 --> 55:18.314
She'd carve up the place among
them and send me on the wallaby.

55:18.399 --> 55:23.111
Frank. And make sure Butler gives you
the right gauge ofwire this time. Hmm?

55:25.239 --> 55:27.824
There's our acceptance for the ball,
and make sure you give it to Harry.

55:27.908 --> 55:30.159
Harry. Harry Beecham?
He's back?

55:30.244 --> 55:32.870
Oh, yes. Has been
for a couple ofweeks.

55:32.955 --> 55:35.289
That's all the mail, unless
you have anything to add.

55:35.374 --> 55:37.333
Um, can I take it?

55:37.418 --> 55:40.837
Well, I don't suppose Frank
would mind a passenger.

55:40.921 --> 55:45.091
- Oh, I'd like to go by myself.
- Not on your life, Syb. Not with those horses.

56:00.107 --> 56:02.859
Strange that Harry's not been over.

56:05.237 --> 56:07.739
Can't have much time for you.

56:10.951 --> 56:14.454
Excuse me.
Don't go through the gate.

56:20.294 --> 56:22.962
You'll soon realize
you can't do better than me.

56:23.964 --> 56:26.799
I'd love to see the looks at home.

56:26.884 --> 56:30.678
You'd certainly surprise
those English girls, you know.

56:30.763 --> 56:32.680
Yes, sir.

56:32.765 --> 56:34.682
Oh, damn.

56:41.315 --> 56:43.733
Hey. Hey, wait.

56:43.817 --> 56:46.736
Wait! Damn it!

56:46.820 --> 56:49.238
Wait, damn you! Stop!

57:12.179 --> 57:14.138
How have you been?

57:14.223 --> 57:16.140
I'm well.

57:16.225 --> 57:18.309
As I was two weeks ago.

57:19.311 --> 57:21.687
Pleased to hear that.

57:21.772 --> 57:25.274
You promised to come to Caddagat
as soon as you got back.

57:25.359 --> 57:27.443
I've been busy.

57:27.528 --> 57:29.737
You promised.

57:29.822 --> 57:33.366
We haven't got that muslin Mrs.
Bossier wanted. It'll be here next week.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.451
Thanks, Mrs. Butler.
I'll tell her.

57:35.536 --> 57:37.620
You're just the same as all men.

57:37.704 --> 57:40.456
And you're different
from other girls?

57:40.541 --> 57:43.376
I've heard how you've been behaving,
flirting with every man within miles.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.461
Who told you that?

57:45.546 --> 57:47.547
Who?

57:49.508 --> 57:51.676
Frank Hawden?

57:51.802 --> 57:54.637
There. That's everything, Miss
Melvyn. And you believed him.

57:54.721 --> 57:57.390
See you next time.
Thank you, Mrs. Butler.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.526
I'm sorry.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.779
So you should be.

58:57.993 --> 59:00.995
I- I thought we were mates.
Aren't we?

59:10.255 --> 59:12.548
I'll see you at the ball.

59:21.308 --> 59:26.103
And do you mean to say that Frank
had to walk four miles back here?

59:26.188 --> 59:30.066
In his tight boots?

59:30.150 --> 59:32.109
It's no joking matter, Julius.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.862
No, no, Mother. No, no, no.

59:39.326 --> 59:41.369
Serves him right though.

59:41.453 --> 59:44.288
That girl must learn to behave.

59:44.373 --> 59:46.749
I've sent her to her room.

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:07.478
Did, uh-

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.356
Did you see Harry at Dogtrap?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.358
Yes.

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:18.531
You know, I-

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.784
I think you might be in love
with Harry Beecham.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:26.163
We're friends, that's all.
Nothing else.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.460
Be careful how you treat him.

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.546
What do you mean?

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.925
Well, you know what they say: Heed
the spark or you may dread the fire.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.679
- For heaven's sake.
- Well, Sybylla, he is a man ofthe world.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:45.266
He has quite a reputation
with the ladies in Melbourne.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.393
Yes, I'll bet he has.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:50.271
And it's always
been taken for granted...

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.107
that he'd marry
into one ofthe best families.

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.276
Well, Aunt Gussie
will make sure of that.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.322
Look, Aunt Helen,
you don't have to worry.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.615
I know he can marry anyone.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.701
I know.

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:06.495
And I know he wouldn't
want to marry me.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.915
Even if I wanted to get married,
which I don't,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.543
he'd never ask me in a million years.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.476
So-So long as you know.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:35.566
In the box,
there's a surprise for you-

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.110
a lovely new dress for the ball.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:37.503
Excuse me, ma'am.
Dinner is served.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.801
Would you come in
to dinner, everyone?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.182
Ah, Gussie. Allow me, huh?
Thank you.

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:59.775
What a charming evening
it's turned out to be.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:26.510
At that time it was in a terrible state.
Really shocking. Anyway, I remember-

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:34.685
There were people. They were
soldiers. They actually - Thank you.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.770
Oh, you're welcome.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:40.024
All right.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:44.862
I see that Furlow has
bought himself a very fine bull.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.406
That should make
a few cows happy.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:55.808
Rutherford.
The Duke of Rutherford, of course.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:57.851
Really?
Almost family.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:06.569
Go in, girls, and dance
with the grown-ups.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:09.363
That was delightful.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:12.366
Thank you.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.577
I'm afraid she's
a bit of a handful.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:17.955
I do hope she behaved herself
while she was with you.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:21.584
Why not? Charming girl.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.640
How you doin', miss? You havin'
a good time? Will you dance?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.851
Sure enough.

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.317
They're so stuffy in there, Joe.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.444
They've forgotten
how to enjoy themselves.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:34.281
 I looked upon the nobles
with their lineages old 

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:38.786
- It's so much better to be here.
-  I looked upon their mansions and their acres and their gold 

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:43.248
 I saw their women radiant
in jewelled robes appear 

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:47.378
 And then I joined the army
of the outcasts in the rear 

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.547
 Tramp, tramp  

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.502
Harry, let me go.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.389
Didn't you like me
dancing with the peasants?

01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:24.475
I'm not going to make
a big thing ofthis.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.560
I disgraced you, didn't I? I
have to go away for a few days.

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.604
Oh, more shearing somewhere else?

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.232
And I must be told-
is it yes or no?

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:34.902
- What's the question?
- Bloody woman.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:36.904
I thought-

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:39.990
I thought we should get married.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.243
Well, what a handsome proposal.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.830
How could anyone say no?

01:08:46.915 --> 01:08:49.541
How dare you.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:40.968
Harry, I-I'm sorry.

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:43.761
It was my fault.
It was stupid of me.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:59.069
I should really get back to my guests.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:33.854
Oh!

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:39.067
The boy's an idiot,
but you did lead him on.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.153
I didn't mean to.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:46.366
I'm a misfit, a larrikin.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:50.245
My nose is the wrong shape.
True.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.539
Then why me?

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:56.209
Because he loves you,
and I think you love him.

01:10:57.337 --> 01:10:59.421
And you make all the other
misses who've been through here...

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.382
look like so many pale insipid
nobodies, which they undoubtedly are.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:06.303
But why does it always have
to come down to marriage?

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.847
Don't be foolish, child.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.892
It's natural to want someone
as part of you, part of your life.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:15.312
I don't want
to be part of anyone.

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:19.650
Do you imagine you're the only
female on Earth to have such notions?

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:25.906
Loneliness is a terrible price
to pay for independence.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:30.911
Sybylla, don't throw away reality
for some impossible dream.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:33.580
It's not impossible.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:36.458
It's not.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:58.563
Good-bye!

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.211
Hello, Podgy.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.925
Hello, silly Syb.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.322
I've got to leave all this, Syb.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.449
We're closing the house.

01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:36.203
I'm going north
to see to the other properties.

01:13:36.287 --> 01:13:39.456
Why? What's happened?

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.418
The bank wants its money,
and I haven't got it.

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.754
They couldn't take everything.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.839
They could.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.761
How long have you known?

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.846
Quite a while.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.309
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.063
I'm sorry. I should've.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:09.111
I was afraid of losing you as well.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.948
Oh, Harry.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.033
I am sorry.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.462
Now you know.

01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:30.590
There's no need to feel tied.

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:34.761
I mean, I shouldn't have asked you. I
- I had no right.

01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:37.055
I'll be a poor man.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:44.896
But we'll be friends...
and mates.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:47.649
Won't we?

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:49.985
Of course.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:53.446
Do you think I cared for you
just because you were rich?

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:55.824
No, Harry.

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:04.332
There's something I must say.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:12.382
I- I wish I could help you.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.888
Could you-

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.307
Can you give me a bit oftime?

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.392
Maybe two years.

01:15:23.603 --> 01:15:26.980
You see, I'm just not ready yet.

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:29.941
Last night-

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:33.987
I don't know.
I think I was trying to hurt you,

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:37.991
make you let go, do something.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.040
Give me a chance to find out
what's wrong with the world and with me,

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:48.376
who I am, everything.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.047
Then I'll marry you,

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:55.300
if you need me and I can help.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.222
You do understand, don't you?

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:06.436
Of course I do.

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:09.648
I knew you would.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:13.628
I don't know what you've been up to now,
but Mrs. Bossier wants to see you.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.922
Oh, Biddy, I've just got to finish
this page - She wants you now.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:18.800
They're all waiting-
Mr. Julius and Mrs. Bell. Hurry.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:22.470
Damn, damn, damn.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.562
Come in, dear, and sit down.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.986
I'll come straight
to the point, Sybylla.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:42.157
It seems your father has got himself
into difficulties again. Money, of course.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:45.201
He borrowed £500
from a chap called McSwat...

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:49.497
and put the farm up as security
at four percent interest.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.958
That's £20 a year. Very fair.

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:57.756
- What's this got to do with me? - Well, your mother
says she's tried, but there is no way they can pay it.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.385
And this McSwat chap's made a very generous
offer. He'd be worth a few bob, I'd say.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.512
Julius.

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.599
So it's been arranged
that instead of the interest,

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:11.644
he will accept your services
as governess to his children.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:15.565
Arranged? Don't I have a say?

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.447
I won't go.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.532
I won't.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:39.464
Life around here will certainly
be uneventful when she's gone.

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:43.176
Do her the world of good.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.388
Make her think of other people...

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.473
instead of herself.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:27.720
Uh, this is my name-Miss Melvyn.

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:31.307
Old boozy Melvyn's daughter.

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.935
I'll have no more impertinence,
thank you.

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:36.146
Now, sit up straight and attend.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.983
James, fetch the textbooks, please.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.360
Ain't got none.
Rats got 'em.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.737
Pa says you can teach
out of your head.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:48.366
Miss Killen couldn't. She was
as mad as a tree full of galahs.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:51.411
And the one before her
only stayed a week...

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.535
and ran off in the bush,
and we never saw her again.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:55.540
And the one before her.
Possum!

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.542
Possum!
Get down!

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.171
Possum!

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:06.759
Come back!

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:19.230
Lizer, Sarah, come on.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:23.067
Here you go.
Good girl.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.866
Come on.
Tea's ready!

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:42.003
Watch it!

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:45.632
Save some for me, Jimmy.
Give me a bowl.

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:47.675
Here you go.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.136
I don't want any.

01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:52.889
Mom!

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:24.045
Jimmy, I've told you before.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.422
Would you use a fork to put
the food into your mouth.

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:29.008
- Didn't give me one.
- Well, use your fingers.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.386
Don't use your knife.
Why not? Pa does.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:36.266
- I'm a richer man today than them that don't.
- You're right there, Pa.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.601
Yeah, you're right, Pa.

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:42.272
- Well, your pa doesn't talk with his mouth full.
- Ma does.

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:46.067
You're gonna have your work
cut out with this lot.

01:21:57.288 --> 01:22:01.749
Oh. I see you've received
another one ofthese too.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:05.587
Really, how can she expect us
to believe all this nonsense?

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:07.755
I won! I won!

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.217
Of course you won.
I didn't stand a chance.

01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:13.386
Oh, yes, you did.
I did not.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.264
You did.
I did not.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:22.270
Ah, Gertie, Frank.
Just in time for tea.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:24.772
Did you have a good game?
Yes.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:27.609
Hmm. And who won?
I did.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.071
I think Frank
is being rather gallant.

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:34.532
Ooh. Sandwiches.

01:22:34.742 --> 01:22:39.454
Today I want to show you
another very important letter-

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.373
the letter "H."

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:47.295
"H" follows the letter
we learned yesterday-"G."

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:52.216
"A" - Sybylla, we cannot interfere
with your mother's wishes.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.302
The time will soon pass.

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.596
You would hardly recognize
your little sister.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.765
She has blossomed
into quite a young lady.

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.601
Try and do good
where you are, dear.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:04.437
We can't always get
what we would like in this world.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.439
As in "hot."

01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:12.153
"H."

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:15.031
Good shot, Jimmy.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:27.418
Ma! Ma! Ma!

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.798
Hurry, Ma! Quick!

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:34.175
Hurry, Ma! Ma!

01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:46.104
Mom! Mom, get her off me!

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:54.320
Ma! Ma!

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.964
 The day 

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:16.300
 Lulled by the moonlight 

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:20.304
 Have all passed away 

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.975
 Beautiful dreamer  

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.227
"When stooping o'er a thirsty rose,

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:29.814
she murmured,
'Frederick, fetch my hose. "'

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:34.402
Page 25.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.198
Twenty-four.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.284
Up here.

01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:44.829
"The devil is dead.
There is no hell.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.457
The devil is dead,
and all is well. " Hmm.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:50.126
"And I,

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:54.756
"the one that have
loved him the best,

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.049
"have grown...

01:24:57.134 --> 01:25:01.053
"to be past caring.

01:25:01.138 --> 01:25:03.723
"I've grown...

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:08.186
"to be past caring,

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.772
"past...

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.774
"waiting...

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:15.693
and past wearing."

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:20.948
I suppose I should thank God
for one agreeable daughter.

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:24.368
If Gertie marries Harry Beecham,
it will be a blessing.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:30.374
Your grandmother says he's come back and has
managed to regain possession of Five Bob Downs.

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.336
He seems to spend
most of his time with Gertie,

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.505
who must enjoy his company.

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.634
Who's that?
It's me.

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:23.761
You gave me a start.

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:27.515
What are you doing out here?
Just thinking, really.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:29.892
Been over to see Susie again?

01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:32.228
Yeah.
Third time this week.

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:04.218
We wanna have a serious
talk with you, lovey.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:07.722
Now-

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:12.268
Well, you see, we want you
to know that we like you...

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:14.562
and that you're being
a good girl.

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:18.065
It'd be different
if you had some property.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.610
You see, our Peter,

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:24.238
he's almost as sure as
made it with Susie Duffy.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:26.282
What are you talking about?

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:29.952
Oh, we've seen you...
going out at night.

01:27:30.037 --> 01:27:32.455
We can't say we blame you.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:34.582
He's a good-lookin' lad.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:37.251
But you don't have any
property, you see, like I said.

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.921
You don't think that-
You can't.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:43.507
Oh, no.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:46.844
There, there, lovey.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.388
I told you it'd be too much
of a shock for her.

01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:53.601
Come on. No one ever really
died of a broken heart.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.978
You see, girl,

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:59.065
things being as they are,

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:01.692
we gotta send you home.

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.948
I've wrote a bit
of a letter for you.

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:09.116
Just to tell your ma.

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:13.913
And they don't have
to worry about the money,

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:16.248
not until things look up.

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:21.212
Come on.
Don't take it so hard.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.965
There's plenty of other
nice fellas in the world.

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.148
Stanley.

01:28:42.401 --> 01:28:45.861
Could you see to Maisie when
you've finished separating the milk?

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:49.949
Come on. Oh! Oh, dear.

01:28:50.033 --> 01:28:52.618
Come on.
Let's see how that cake's doing.

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:54.745
Will you bring that in, Aurora?

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:58.749
There now.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.477
Hey, you poor, wee thing.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:21.814
You poor, wee thing.
We'll get you out. Come on.

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:23.941
Oh, lift up those legs.

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.030
Now, come on. Out you go.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.282
Come on. Come on.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.409
Come on.

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:37.329
Come on.
That's the way.

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:51.427
Do you need a hand?

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.101
Peeping and prying again, are you?

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.193
That's the boy.

01:30:07.277 --> 01:30:09.320
Back to your mother. Come on.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.710
It's good to see you again, Syb.

01:30:24.795 --> 01:30:28.672
We heard from Grandmother
that you might be coming down.

01:30:30.801 --> 01:30:33.010
I must look a sight.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:38.599
I'm glad you saved Five Bob.

01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:40.893
Oh, I was lucky, that's all.

01:30:43.522 --> 01:30:47.983
Did-Did you find the answers
to all those questions?

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:51.320
I mean, what was wrong with the world
- Oh, yes.

01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:53.989
Partly me.

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.245
Well,

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:01.330
here I am.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:07.169
Yes. I don't suppose you
thought it would be like this.

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:14.301
Aunt Gussie sends her love.

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:17.346
She's very keen
on me getting married.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.142
Yes, I think
it's a good idea too.

01:31:21.226 --> 01:31:23.144
Oh, Syb, do you?

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:25.312
Yes. Gertie's
just right for you.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:27.398
She's everything I'm not.

01:31:28.567 --> 01:31:30.568
Look, I've got to change.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.321
Father's down in the paddock.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:38.909
Syb! It's not Gertie I-

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:41.370
It's you.

01:31:41.454 --> 01:31:43.956
It's you I want to marry.

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:51.463
Please, please understand.

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:54.842
You promised if I needed you-

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:57.011
I do, Syb.

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:02.725
I love you.
I want to marry you.

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:06.187
Trust me, Syb.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:09.064
It's me I don't trust.

01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:11.525
Can't you see?

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:19.366
The last thing I want is-
is to be a wife out in the bush,

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:21.744
having a baby every year.

01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:25.164
You can have anything you want.

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.960
We can go to the city
as much as you like.

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.297
Dear, dear Harry.

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:40.387
Maybe I'm ambitious, selfish.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:46.727
But I can't lose myself
in somebody else's life...

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:49.063
when I haven't lived my own yet.

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:56.111
I want to be a writer.

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:01.408
At least I'm going to try.

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:04.161
But I've got to do it now.

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:08.332
And I've got to do it alone.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:13.504
Please try and understand.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.432
I thought you loved me.

01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:28.269
Harry.

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:31.772
Don't you love me even a little?

01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:36.110
Oh, Harry.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:40.406
I'm so near loving you.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.618
But I'd destroy you.

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:46.870
And I can't do that.

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:26.035
"So now
I've written it all down.

01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:30.205
"Why? To try
and make sense of it?

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:33.500
"It may come out sounding
like a couple of nails...

01:34:33.585 --> 01:34:36.170
"in a rusty tin pot.

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:41.425
"My ineffectual life may be trod
in the same round oftoil.

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:47.097
"But I want to tell everyone
about my own people,

01:34:47.182 --> 01:34:50.726
"how I love them and pity them,

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.936
"pity all of us.

01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:57.900
"The sun is shining
on another day,

01:34:57.984 --> 01:35:01.028
"and hope is whispering in my ear.

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:05.032
"With love and good wishes to all,

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:07.076
"good night.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.620
"Good-bye.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.705
Amen."
