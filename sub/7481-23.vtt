Oh, God.

You okay?
Yeah.

01:29.719 --> 01:32.137
Last night got
a little rough.

01:32.139 --> 01:33.388
Oh, really?

01:33.390 --> 01:35.123
Who?

01:35.125 --> 01:36.509
Joshie.

01:36.511 --> 01:37.961
Joshie... Joshie?

01:37.963 --> 01:39.631
Is that the one
who made your legs shake?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.633
No, that was Griff.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.800
All right, so tell me
about Joshie.

01:42.802 --> 01:45.187
Joshie, Joshie...

01:46.358 --> 01:47.858
Kind of over Joshie.

01:47.860 --> 01:50.111
That quick?
For one night only.

01:50.113 --> 01:52.146
Well, it's supposed to be fun
and make you feel good,

01:52.148 --> 01:53.250
not wake up sore.

01:53.252 --> 01:56.253
It's different
for girls.

01:56.255 --> 01:59.490
Maybe you should go
crawling back to Griff.

01:59.493 --> 02:00.926
Well, I will
if he comes back around.

02:00.928 --> 02:02.210
I haven't had a repeat
in six months.

02:02.212 --> 02:04.664
I'm sorry,
did I miss something?

02:04.666 --> 02:06.834
Who... who are these guys?
They're not guys,

02:06.836 --> 02:08.169
they're WODs.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.939
W-O-Ds?

02:09.941 --> 02:11.190
What's that,
like a BFF with an STD?

02:13.195 --> 02:15.313
W-O-D is workout of the day.

02:15.315 --> 02:16.847
I started doing CrossFit.

02:16.849 --> 02:18.467
Why?

02:18.469 --> 02:19.986
You got to try it.

02:19.988 --> 02:21.033
It's addictive.

02:21.035 --> 02:23.192
So is meth.
Okay, listen.

02:23.194 --> 02:24.323
You are tired.

02:24.325 --> 02:26.635
You are sore,
you are miserable.

02:26.636 --> 02:29.300
You are stretching muscles
you didn't even know you had.

02:29.302 --> 02:30.533
You are in a pool
of sweat, and yet,

02:30.535 --> 02:32.034
all you can think about

02:32.036 --> 02:34.413
is doing it again
as soon as possible.

02:34.415 --> 02:37.738
Hmm. And they name all these
workouts after random guys?

02:37.740 --> 02:39.560
No, actually the hero WODs

02:39.562 --> 02:42.040
are named after firefighters,
soldiers, police officers,

02:42.042 --> 02:44.519
fallen heroes
killed in the line of duty.

02:44.521 --> 02:46.731
But, actually, you know what,
the toughest ones

02:46.733 --> 02:49.431
are named after women--
Helen, Fran.

02:49.433 --> 02:50.763
Fran, now that's a tough broad.

02:50.765 --> 02:53.598
For real.
Fight Gone Bad. Filthy 50.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.032
How about Lazy
Sunday Morning?

02:55.034 --> 02:57.023
Watching a Football Game
with a Cold Beer?

02:58.190 --> 02:59.537
No pain, no gain.

02:59.539 --> 03:01.056
If I'm gonna pay
someone to hurt me,

03:01.058 --> 03:02.085
it better be a dominatrix.

03:02.087 --> 03:03.924
Oh, do tell.

03:03.926 --> 03:05.157
That was a joke.

03:05.159 --> 03:06.810
That was a joke.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.868
I have noticed some unexplained
bruising in the past.

03:08.870 --> 03:11.059
Thank you.

03:11.061 --> 03:12.212
Yo, man, I don't judge.
Thank you.

03:12.214 --> 03:13.760
Whatever you want to do
on your spare time

03:13.762 --> 03:15.424
is your business,
as long as you don't ask me

03:15.426 --> 03:17.285
to spank you, we're all good.

03:17.287 --> 03:18.669
Great.

03:18.671 --> 03:20.399
Ah, you like that?

03:20.401 --> 03:22.178
Mistress
Henrietta awaits your arrival

03:22.180 --> 03:23.692
in the operations center.

03:23.694 --> 03:26.625
Those who are tardy
will be subjected

03:26.627 --> 03:28.058
to severe punishment.

03:28.060 --> 03:30.562
Unless punishment
is something you desire.

03:30.564 --> 03:32.208
No, not you.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.906
Sorry. Just role-playing.

03:33.908 --> 03:35.503
Oh, I get it.

03:35.505 --> 03:37.974
The, uh, tech nerd
can't play with the cool kids.

03:37.976 --> 03:40.115
What?

03:40.116 --> 03:41.993
Man...

03:44.233 --> 03:47.791
Good morning, all.

03:47.793 --> 03:49.964
Miss Jones.
An hour ago

03:49.966 --> 03:52.106
Monica Davis
was the intended target

03:52.108 --> 03:53.967
of a shooter in Hollywood.

03:54.956 --> 03:56.760
Nice little
serpentine move.

03:56.784 --> 03:57.791
Yeah,

03:57.792 --> 04:00.178
she's bobbing and weaving like
she's used to getting shot at.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.693
Who is she?
Miss Davis

04:01.695 --> 04:05.762
is a hostess at the
Afrobeat nighclub N'Kosi.

04:05.764 --> 04:07.497
Why is someone
trying to kill her?

04:07.500 --> 04:08.812
We don't know.
And we weren't able

04:08.814 --> 04:11.560
to get a clear angle
of his face.

04:11.562 --> 04:14.089
We're not sure, but he may be
involved with this man.

04:14.091 --> 04:15.607
Johannes Waaldt.

04:15.609 --> 04:17.916
He's the owner of N'Kosi,
where Monica works.

04:17.918 --> 04:19.855
He's also the face
of several charities

04:19.857 --> 04:22.602
that build water purification
systems in Africa.

04:22.604 --> 04:25.839
- Am I missing something?
- Back in the day,

04:25.841 --> 04:28.064
Waaldt was quite the
international arms dealer.

04:29.076 --> 04:30.592
And that would be it.

04:32.077 --> 04:34.318
That's Abdul Habaza.

04:35.532 --> 04:37.841
The man who killed Moe.

04:37.843 --> 04:40.168
From helicopters

04:40.170 --> 04:43.456
to rocket launchers,
JoJo was a one-stop shop

04:43.458 --> 04:45.292
until he became
a legitimate businessman.

04:45.316 --> 04:46.406
So what happened,

04:46.407 --> 04:48.798
Monica Davis saw something
she wasn't supposed to see?

04:48.800 --> 04:50.282
We're not sure.

04:50.284 --> 04:53.535
And we've lost contact
with our man inside.

04:53.537 --> 04:55.947
Who's that?

05:00.263 --> 05:01.577
Deeks?

05:01.579 --> 05:03.128
Not Deeks.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.949
Max Gentry.

05:04.951 --> 05:07.297
How long's he been working this?

05:07.299 --> 05:10.407
This is a question for
Assistant Director Granger.

05:10.409 --> 05:13.798
Apparently he set this up.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.907
Well, what is Deeks saying?

05:14.909 --> 05:17.851
He hasn't checked
in yet.

05:17.853 --> 05:19.637
We're still waiting
for his call.

05:22.731 --> 05:25.327
Oh, my God. That was crazy.

05:25.329 --> 05:26.485
That dude could've killed me.

05:26.487 --> 05:28.108
Oh, you got that part, did you?

05:28.110 --> 05:29.232
And then you squeal in

05:29.234 --> 05:30.803
like freaking Steve McQueen
from <i>Bullitt</i>

05:30.805 --> 05:32.242
and I'm, like, get me
the hell out of here.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.533
And you're, like,
bang, bang, bang,

05:33.535 --> 05:36.013
getting all
Fast Five with it.

05:36.015 --> 05:38.412
Was that, like, insane, or what?
No, that wasn't like insane,

05:38.414 --> 05:40.066
that was actually insane.

05:40.068 --> 05:41.802
I know, right,
just feel my heart.

05:41.804 --> 05:45.193
Seriously, baby, feel my heart.
No.

05:45.195 --> 05:47.129
Why are you so mad?

05:47.131 --> 05:48.784
'Cause you almost
got yourself killed.

05:48.786 --> 05:50.801
But you saved me.

05:50.803 --> 05:53.829
You... are such a badass.
Come one, baby, come here.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.972
Don't, stop. Just stop.
Just relax, Max.

05:56.974 --> 06:00.197
We got away; we're home free.
Are you kidding me?

06:00.199 --> 06:02.348
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

06:02.350 --> 06:04.753
I'm not afraid of JoJo.
You should be.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.728
Honestly, I can't
even believe you did this.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.305
Well, what did you
expect me to do?

06:09.329 --> 06:09.975
Uh, maybe

06:09.976 --> 06:11.335
what I told you-- you go in,
you take some pictures.

06:11.337 --> 06:12.791
It was that simple.
But when

06:12.793 --> 06:14.531
opportunity knocks...
Yeah, well opportunity's about to

06:14.533 --> 06:16.004
kick open that door and shoot
us both in the head.

06:16.005 --> 06:17.301
Somebody's about
to kick in that door

06:17.302 --> 06:19.943
and shoot us both in the head.
Really? You joking?

06:19.945 --> 06:22.207
You joking?
Are you done?

06:22.209 --> 06:25.813
Max... chill out.

06:25.815 --> 06:28.298
You want to see them?
No, I don't.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.610
Yes, you do.
No, I don't. Put them back.

06:29.612 --> 06:30.702
I don't
want to see them.

06:30.704 --> 06:31.700
Don't...

06:31.702 --> 06:33.836
Oh, I just
dropped a Bentley.

06:33.838 --> 06:35.134
Can you please just give those to me?
Yeah.

06:35.136 --> 06:36.874
Just give...
Don't put them down your...

06:36.876 --> 06:39.897
Are you... don't, you're gonna drop...

06:39.899 --> 06:41.083
Ooh.
Are you serious right now?

06:41.085 --> 06:42.776
You're dropping
diamonds...

06:44.406 --> 06:47.682
This was a terrible idea.

06:59.226 --> 07:01.124
Deek's phone is still
at his cover house.

07:01.126 --> 07:03.972
All right, so why hasn't he
checked in?

07:03.974 --> 07:05.555
Maybe he didn't
have a chance yet.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.326
Yeah, but he's got to
know we saw the shooting.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.590
If he was in trouble,
he would've sent a distress.

07:09.592 --> 07:13.896
- Not if he's injured or... dead.
- I got him.

07:13.898 --> 07:15.228
Deeks sent an encrypted text.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.953
Did he say
what the hell happened?

07:17.649 --> 07:19.877
There's been
a complication.

07:19.879 --> 07:21.076
Yeah, we've gathered that.

07:21.078 --> 07:22.884
- What else?
- That's it.

07:22.886 --> 07:23.447
That's it?

07:23.473 --> 07:25.630
It was a short text.
More of a tweet.

07:27.868 --> 07:29.530
- He doesn't have a plan.
- So what are we supposed to do,

07:29.531 --> 07:31.191
just sit around and wait
until he comes up with one?

07:31.217 --> 07:32.065
No.

07:32.066 --> 07:33.669
Sam and I are gonna head down
to Waaldt's club

07:33.671 --> 07:35.729
and we're gonna find out
who we're dealing with.

07:35.731 --> 07:36.929
Okay, what am I
supposed to do?

07:36.931 --> 07:38.770
Back up your partner.

07:38.772 --> 07:41.271
Are there surveillance cameras
at the cover house?

07:41.273 --> 07:42.841
Uh, no. But he's
got an earwig.

07:42.843 --> 07:44.446
We can send him a message,
tell him to put it in.

07:44.448 --> 07:46.372
Do it.
Send the address to my phone.

07:47.909 --> 07:49.767
Keep an eye on her.

07:49.769 --> 07:52.841
Will do.

07:53.856 --> 07:55.830
All right,
you ready?

07:55.833 --> 07:57.875
We can't go to a club
dressed like this.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.378
Why not? The club's
not even open yet.

07:59.380 --> 08:01.033
Yeah, we still don't
want to walk in there

08:01.035 --> 08:02.419
looking like a
couple of hobos.

08:02.421 --> 08:03.932
Hobos?

08:03.933 --> 08:07.090
What is this, 1939?
Yeah, we got to look the part.

08:07.092 --> 08:10.398
What, Hetty get you
a new suit or something?

08:11.497 --> 08:12.992
You got a new suit?

08:12.994 --> 08:15.553
I'm due.
I'm due.

08:15.555 --> 08:17.099
Why didn't she get me
a new suit?

08:17.101 --> 08:19.144
Maybe she wanted
to surprise you.

08:19.146 --> 08:21.089
Hetty? Am I, uh,
getting a new suit?

08:21.091 --> 08:24.414
Not till you return the
pants from the last one.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.741
I told you
I can't find them.

08:26.743 --> 08:28.554
What is that?

08:28.556 --> 08:30.448
It was Armani Prive.

08:30.450 --> 08:33.058
I was under cover.
Things happen.

08:33.061 --> 08:34.522
G, you lost your pants.

08:34.524 --> 08:36.666
Even Deeks doesn't
lose his pants.

08:36.668 --> 08:37.796
Come on.

08:37.798 --> 08:39.875
We're lucky Deeks wears pants.

08:44.664 --> 08:47.572
I got to tell you, Hetty sure
outdid herself this time.

08:47.574 --> 08:49.102
Don't even start.

08:49.104 --> 08:51.529
What, you don't think
this is a sharp suit?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.674
Maybe it's because
it's new.

08:53.676 --> 08:56.134
Do you remember before
we were partners?

08:56.135 --> 08:57.779
Yeah, what about it?
I miss those days.

08:57.781 --> 09:00.573
Yeah? Okay,
Lone Wolf McQuade.

09:00.575 --> 09:02.435
Well, today, I'm
an ex-running back,

09:02.437 --> 09:04.480
you're my agent,
and we're here

09:04.482 --> 09:06.658
to rent the club for
an NFL draft party.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.937
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:07.939 --> 09:09.945
How come I don't get
to be the ex-player?

09:09.947 --> 09:11.150
As what, a kicker?

09:11.152 --> 09:13.491
Quarterback.

09:13.493 --> 09:15.884
I'm taller than Doug Flutie,
I'm mobile...

09:18.143 --> 09:19.480
Fine, fine.

09:19.481 --> 09:20.851
We'll try it your way.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.474
But I'd still make
a great quarterback.

09:22.476 --> 09:25.318
Yeah, just keep your
pants on in there.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.336
Do you want
the whole dance area?

09:30.338 --> 09:32.492
Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna want
the, uh, VIP room,

09:32.495 --> 09:34.182
and we're gonna buy out
the whole bar.

09:34.184 --> 09:35.855
Great, we can also do
specialty drinks.

09:35.857 --> 09:37.411
I like it.

09:37.413 --> 09:40.037
This will work.

09:40.039 --> 09:41.677
You getting all this, Eric?

09:41.679 --> 09:43.433
Yeah.

09:43.435 --> 09:46.076
Waaldt we already know.

09:48.837 --> 09:50.342
Okay, our shooter's name

09:50.344 --> 09:52.132
is Pieter Smit.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.686
He's a South African native.

09:53.689 --> 09:55.927
Looks like he's worked
security for everyone

09:55.929 --> 09:59.490
from Blackwater to drug cartels
in Mexico and Bolivia.

09:59.492 --> 10:01.130
Who's the guy in the middle?

10:01.132 --> 10:02.669
That is Noah Bernosoni.

10:02.671 --> 10:04.459
He's Swiss.

10:04.461 --> 10:05.981
He's an international banker,

10:05.983 --> 10:08.240
most recently
with Wahr Geld Bank.

10:08.242 --> 10:10.833
Uh, graduated from
London School of Economics.

10:10.835 --> 10:12.001
No criminal record.

10:12.003 --> 10:13.486
All right, keep digging.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.956
If he's dealing
with Waaldt, he's probably

10:14.958 --> 10:16.626
- into something dirty.
- On it.

10:16.628 --> 10:17.961
And the bar is
fully stocked.

10:17.963 --> 10:19.047
and it's all top-shelf.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.717
Great.

10:20.719 --> 10:22.887
Well, good.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.609
And we also provide
the valet service until 1:30.

10:25.611 --> 10:28.848
Anything later would
have to be arranged beforehand.

10:28.850 --> 10:30.851
Appreciate you showing us around.
Thank you.

10:30.853 --> 10:33.122
We'll be in touch.
Great.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.462
Thank you.
Thank you.

10:39.886 --> 10:43.107
Maybe I'll have the two biggest
ones made into earrings.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.759
What do you think?
I think you should

10:44.761 --> 10:46.980
put them back in the bag
before you lose them.

10:46.982 --> 10:48.316
Give them to me.

10:51.188 --> 10:52.557
Oh, gotcha!

10:52.559 --> 10:54.693
Just like Richard Gere
in <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

10:54.695 --> 10:56.530
Remember the jewelry box
that he snaps shut?

10:56.532 --> 10:57.782
Chomp.

10:57.784 --> 10:59.001
I love that movie.

10:59.003 --> 11:00.403
Yeah, it was a classic.

11:01.239 --> 11:02.841
Want to take a shower?
No.

11:02.843 --> 11:06.131
No, I... don't.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.717
Well,

11:07.719 --> 11:10.188
suit yourself.

11:12.426 --> 11:13.811
Oh, my God.

11:13.813 --> 11:15.197
That's okay.

11:15.199 --> 11:16.816
I'll just get that--
that's fine.

11:16.818 --> 11:19.077
I'm here to clean.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.737
Oh, my God.

11:34.763 --> 11:36.760
Hey!

11:36.762 --> 11:38.860
You're not going to run off
with my diamonds, are you?

11:39.667 --> 11:41.860
Just take your shower.

11:41.862 --> 11:43.727
Last chance to join me.

11:43.729 --> 11:44.849
Yeah, no,

11:44.851 --> 11:45.955
I'm more of a bath guy myself.

11:45.957 --> 11:47.639
But thank you.

11:47.641 --> 11:48.845
Oh, that's romantic.

11:48.847 --> 11:51.453
I like that.

11:56.853 --> 11:58.667
Are you there, God,
it's me, Margaret.

11:58.669 --> 12:00.946
Judy Blume, really?

12:00.948 --> 12:03.125
I got a softer side.

12:03.127 --> 12:04.694
Yeah, it's called your head.

12:04.696 --> 12:06.393
I missed you, too.

12:06.395 --> 12:07.747
Not from what I've seen.

12:07.749 --> 12:09.150
Oh, my God, are you jealous?

12:09.152 --> 12:10.884
Oh, please, if you want
to keep an operation secret,

12:10.886 --> 12:12.371
that is your business.

12:12.373 --> 12:13.658
No, it wasn't a secret.

12:13.660 --> 12:14.896
It wasn't even
an operation, all right?

12:14.898 --> 12:16.580
Granger wanted info on Waaldt

12:16.582 --> 12:18.314
so I went to Waaldt's club.

12:18.316 --> 12:20.130
I picked up his hostess
and got her

12:20.132 --> 12:21.368
to look around for me--
that's it.

12:21.370 --> 12:23.101
And just like that,

12:23.103 --> 12:24.719
she agreed to spy
on her boss for you?

12:24.721 --> 12:28.269
No, it took a little bit
of persuading.

12:28.271 --> 12:30.620
- I hope you used protection.
- It's not like that.

12:30.622 --> 12:32.329
The truth of the matter is
that Max Gentry can be

12:32.331 --> 12:34.173
incredibly charming
when he wants to be.

12:34.175 --> 12:36.508
Maybe I should be
partnered up with Max.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.962
I didn't know she was going to
go all Bonnie and Clyde on me.

12:38.964 --> 12:40.315
So, where is Bonnie?

12:40.317 --> 12:41.583
She's in the bedroom.

12:41.585 --> 12:43.614
I'm surprised
you're not with her.

12:43.616 --> 12:45.001
You sound like her.

12:45.003 --> 12:46.185
What?

12:46.188 --> 12:48.266
Nothing.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.790
What the hell is going on?

12:49.792 --> 12:51.904
So I asked her to snoop
around Waaldt's office.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.292
Guess what she found?

12:53.294 --> 12:54.663
Her panties?

12:54.665 --> 12:56.388
Meow, no not her panties.

12:56.390 --> 12:59.739
She found $10 million
in diamonds.

12:59.741 --> 13:01.176
Who are you talking to?

13:02.598 --> 13:04.509
I-I was... I wasn't.

13:04.511 --> 13:05.862
I heard you.

13:05.864 --> 13:08.197
No, no, I was talking to myself.

13:08.199 --> 13:10.600
That's how I figure things out.

13:12.039 --> 13:13.611
You're so wound up.

13:13.613 --> 13:15.286
I'm fine.

13:17.148 --> 13:18.890
Everything's
gonna be okay.

13:18.892 --> 13:20.784
I promise.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.943
You...

13:23.945 --> 13:26.221
you just need someone
to take care of you.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.484
And, baby...

13:30.073 --> 13:32.125
...I'll take care of you.

13:46.629 --> 13:47.841
How much we thinking?

13:47.842 --> 13:49.926
Well, it's hard to tell
from the photos Deeks sent,

13:49.927 --> 13:53.037
but if they're real--
and there's no real reason

13:53.039 --> 13:54.337
to believe that they're not--

13:54.339 --> 13:56.551
I'm guessing $10 million,

13:56.553 --> 13:58.219
maybe more.

13:58.221 --> 13:59.311
That's a lot of bling.

13:59.312 --> 14:00.738
NCIS in Washington has seen

14:00.740 --> 14:03.048
a recent influx
in blood diamonds.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.888
They're untraceable, won't set
off any metal detectors,

14:05.890 --> 14:07.604
and you can carry
millions-worth in your pocket.

14:07.606 --> 14:08.728
As long as
they're real,

14:08.729 --> 14:10.652
no one cares
where they came from.

14:10.654 --> 14:12.577
Our Red team has tracked
blood diamonds

14:12.579 --> 14:13.892
from Sierra Leone to Antwerp

14:13.894 --> 14:15.545
where their county of origin
papers are often forged.

14:15.547 --> 14:17.037
Other than Afghani heroin,

14:17.039 --> 14:19.829
blood diamonds have been
the most consistent form

14:19.831 --> 14:20.999
of terrorist funding.

14:21.001 --> 14:22.234
So the big
question is

14:22.236 --> 14:24.176
what is Waaldt funding?

14:24.178 --> 14:25.763
$10 million can fund
a nice little coup.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.304
I thought he was out
of the business.

14:27.306 --> 14:30.216
Granger must have had some
suspicions to send Deeks in.

14:30.218 --> 14:31.213
Where's Granger?

14:31.215 --> 14:32.377
Oh, his office says

14:32.379 --> 14:33.957
he is unreachable.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.354
You told them what happened?

14:35.356 --> 14:38.233
Absolutely-- they said
they would pass it along.

14:39.116 --> 14:41.011
We got nothing on this guy.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.341
Well...

14:42.343 --> 14:44.421
his man Smit tried
to kill Monica Davis

14:44.423 --> 14:46.101
in broad daylight.
Some jump-off tried

14:46.103 --> 14:47.515
to steal $10 million
in diamonds from me,

14:47.517 --> 14:48.995
I'd off her
in broad daylight, too.

14:48.997 --> 14:50.509
Wow.

14:50.511 --> 14:52.124
That's good to know.

14:52.126 --> 14:53.487
Hypothetically speaking.

14:53.489 --> 14:55.367
If I were a bad guy.

14:55.369 --> 14:56.698
Uh-huh.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.476
It's attempted murder.

14:59.478 --> 15:01.406
You bring him in,
maybe he gives his boss up.

15:01.408 --> 15:02.636
He's a violent dude.

15:02.638 --> 15:04.351
He's not the cooperative type.

15:04.353 --> 15:07.178
Which means we take
a different tact.

15:08.426 --> 15:09.973
Which would be...?

15:09.975 --> 15:11.620
Something you don't need
to know about.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.209
Hypothetically.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.606
Kens?

15:19.608 --> 15:21.823
Kensi, you out there?

15:21.824 --> 15:23.323
I know you can hear me.

15:23.325 --> 15:24.622
What?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.871
Where are you parked?

15:26.873 --> 15:27.956
Down the street.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.322
I can't even see you.

15:29.324 --> 15:31.372
That's the whole point
of surveillance.

15:31.374 --> 15:33.437
Ah, well, I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

15:33.439 --> 15:34.771
I guarantee it sounded

15:34.773 --> 15:36.871
worse than it actually was.
Who cares?

15:36.873 --> 15:39.121
Oh, my God, I'm sure
Sam doesn't act like this

15:39.123 --> 15:40.287
when Callen gets hit on.

15:40.289 --> 15:42.453
Act like what--
I'm just sitting here

15:42.455 --> 15:43.869
covering your ass.

15:43.871 --> 15:45.953
Not sure what
she's doing with it.

15:45.955 --> 15:47.702
So, we're cool then?

15:47.704 --> 15:49.268
Why wouldn't we be cool?

15:52.369 --> 15:54.651
We should go to
Monaco, you know?

15:54.653 --> 15:56.785
Like James Bond
in <i>Casino Royale?</i>

15:56.787 --> 15:58.150
It's Montenegro.

15:58.152 --> 15:59.867
You could get
a tuxedo.

15:59.869 --> 16:02.767
Mm.
And I'd get some hot dress.

16:02.769 --> 16:04.483
And we'd be
drinking champagne

16:04.485 --> 16:06.483
- and playing roulette.
- No wonder she likes you.

16:06.485 --> 16:07.449
She's delusional.

16:07.451 --> 16:09.366
Okay, first off, <i>Casino Royale</i>

16:09.368 --> 16:10.482
actually happened in Montenegro,

16:10.484 --> 16:11.782
and secondly
we're not going anywhere

16:11.784 --> 16:13.598
until we sort this out.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.769
Where's Montenegro?

16:14.771 --> 16:15.773
Yeah, Deeks.

16:15.775 --> 16:16.960
Where's Montenegro?

16:16.962 --> 16:19.134
It's in Europe.

16:19.136 --> 16:20.639
You have no idea.

16:20.641 --> 16:22.310
The beaches are topless.

16:22.312 --> 16:23.933
Look at that, she speaks Deeks.

16:23.935 --> 16:25.188
Match made in heaven.

16:25.190 --> 16:26.158
We'll could get you

16:26.160 --> 16:28.147
a sexy little Speedo.

16:28.149 --> 16:29.536
I'd pay to see that.

16:29.538 --> 16:30.823
People would pay
to see that.

16:30.825 --> 16:31.961
I know I would.

16:31.963 --> 16:33.499
Tell her not
to waste her money.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.891
It's too small a return
on her investment.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.349
What?

16:38.351 --> 16:39.620
What's so funny?

16:39.622 --> 16:41.793
Nothing, I was just

16:41.795 --> 16:43.299
I was laughing the joke that...

16:43.301 --> 16:45.139
you just told.

16:45.141 --> 16:47.313
Oh, you never find
my jokes funny, Maxi.

16:47.315 --> 16:49.319
Maybe that 'cause
you aren't funny.

16:49.321 --> 16:51.159
No, I do laugh
at your jokes because

16:51.161 --> 16:52.563
you're very funny,
you say clever things

16:52.565 --> 16:54.036
that are very funny.

16:55.626 --> 16:58.635
It's my phone.

16:58.637 --> 17:00.274
It's Waaldt.

17:00.276 --> 17:01.615
Don't answer that.
Why not?

17:01.617 --> 17:03.963
Because he can use
that to trace us here.

17:03.965 --> 17:06.295
You're getting paranoid.

17:06.297 --> 17:07.435
Don't answer the phone!

17:07.436 --> 17:09.480
Hello?

17:09.482 --> 17:11.192
Not the brightest Barbie
in the toy box, is she?

17:11.194 --> 17:12.517
Okay, that doesn't
even make any sense.

17:12.519 --> 17:14.313
No, no, you listen.

17:14.315 --> 17:16.659
Yeah, I've got them,
and if you want them back,

17:16.661 --> 17:17.800
you're gonna have
to pay for them.

17:19.564 --> 17:20.853
I'm not afraid of you.

17:22.196 --> 17:24.040
Whatever.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.102
Hells, yeah,
did you hear that?

17:26.104 --> 17:28.115
I heard it.
I definitely heard it.

17:28.117 --> 17:29.877
Did I sound like
I meant business?

17:29.879 --> 17:32.342
Sounded like she just signed
her own death warrant.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.924
Antagonizing him
isn't gonna help anything.

17:34.926 --> 17:37.675
Screw him.

17:37.677 --> 17:38.934
Why are you acting so weird?

17:38.936 --> 17:41.113
I'm not.
Are you getting cold feet?

17:41.115 --> 17:43.043
Because if you are, it's
a little late for that.

17:43.045 --> 17:44.335
I mean, you knew
Waaldt had diamonds.

17:44.337 --> 17:45.559
I didn't know he had diamonds.

17:45.561 --> 17:47.051
That's why you wanted me
to snoop around.

17:47.053 --> 17:48.243
Don't pretend it's not.

17:48.245 --> 17:50.205
No, it wasn't.

17:50.207 --> 17:52.230
No, you wanted
to know where they were

17:52.232 --> 17:53.742
so that you could steal them.

17:53.744 --> 17:55.236
But I stole them

17:55.238 --> 17:57.230
for you.

17:57.232 --> 17:59.556
You should be happy.

17:59.558 --> 18:02.578
And you should
be thanking me.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.620
You and I...

18:04.622 --> 18:06.862
are gonna live
happily ever after

18:06.864 --> 18:09.055
in luxury.

18:09.057 --> 18:11.048
Clearly delusional.

18:11.050 --> 18:12.958
So, I'm gonna get changed,

18:12.960 --> 18:14.818
and you and I can go
out and celebrate.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.164
We're not gonna go out
and celebrate.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.156
Yes, we are.
No, we're not.

18:18.158 --> 18:18.962
Celebrate. Celebrate.

18:18.986 --> 18:21.616
Put your paws down.
We're st... Oh, my God.

18:21.646 --> 18:23.422
Please help me.

18:23.424 --> 18:25.215
You brought it
on yourself, Maxi.

18:25.217 --> 18:27.873
You're not helping.
You are not helping.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.867
Are you hungry?

18:38.869 --> 18:41.608
No. Keep eating
your bonbons.

18:41.610 --> 18:43.435
No origami today?

18:43.437 --> 18:45.727
No. And stop
littering my dash.

18:46.923 --> 18:48.882
You're hungry.

18:48.884 --> 18:52.894
I know hypoglycemic-induced
hostility when I see it.

18:52.895 --> 18:54.381
I'm just thinking.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.326
About what?

18:58.328 --> 19:00.705
You want to know
what I was thinking?

19:00.731 --> 19:01.403
About eating?

19:01.404 --> 19:03.508
I was thinking about Wakanda.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.437
What is that,
a camp in Wisconsin?

19:07.439 --> 19:10.863
Seeing Abdul Habaza's picture
reminded me of Moe and Jada,

19:10.865 --> 19:13.537
the time I spent
in Chad and Sudan.

19:13.539 --> 19:16.613
I started thinking
about Wakanda.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.552
Where is Wakanda?

19:18.554 --> 19:21.093
It's nowhere. It's a
fictional African country.

19:21.095 --> 19:24.068
The most technically advanced
society in the Marvel Universe.

19:24.070 --> 19:26.141
And the richest.
Hold on a second.

19:26.143 --> 19:27.862
In a comic book?

19:27.864 --> 19:29.925
You just geeked out on me
in a real moment?

19:29.949 --> 19:30.505
Hey, man,

19:30.506 --> 19:32.659
when I was a kid, comic books
were the only thing that made sense.

19:32.661 --> 19:35.351
It was simple-- good
guys versus bad guys.

19:35.353 --> 19:37.741
For me it was all about
T'Challa, the Black Panther.

19:37.765 --> 19:38.361
Of course.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.951
Not just 'cause he was a brother
who was richer than Tony Stark.

19:40.953 --> 19:43.705
T'Challa was a leader,
he was a president,

19:43.707 --> 19:45.209
he was a superhero

19:45.211 --> 19:48.363
all at the same time.

19:48.365 --> 19:50.334
He was all about justice.

19:50.336 --> 19:51.836
When I left Brooklyn,
the only thing

19:51.839 --> 19:53.873
I wanted to see
was the motherland

19:53.875 --> 19:56.395
and-and to witness
that world up close.

19:56.397 --> 20:00.184
But instead of finding Wakanda,
I found poverty, starvation,

20:00.186 --> 20:03.657
child soldiers, death squads.

20:03.659 --> 20:05.561
Waaldt's bread and butter.

20:05.563 --> 20:07.731
I thought I could save Moe.

20:09.702 --> 20:12.289
I really thought
I could help Jada.

20:13.593 --> 20:16.096
That whole motherland thing's
overrated.

20:16.098 --> 20:17.932
I mean, look at me.

20:17.934 --> 20:19.936
I come from a line
of blood-feuding gypsies

20:19.938 --> 20:21.606
who keep trying
to kill me.

20:21.608 --> 20:23.759
How's that justice?

20:26.532 --> 20:30.121
There's our guy.

20:30.123 --> 20:32.041
You ready, T'Challa?

20:32.043 --> 20:34.057
See, I knew I shouldn't
have said that to you.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.781
I always regret it
when I tell you things.

20:36.854 --> 20:38.923
I know you do.

20:38.925 --> 20:41.143
Hey.

20:41.145 --> 20:43.765
Can I bum a smoke?

20:46.554 --> 20:48.481
Thanks.

20:50.144 --> 20:52.752
Got a light?

20:52.754 --> 20:54.597
What kind of a smoker
doesn't have a lighter?

20:54.599 --> 20:56.242
I'm trying to quit.

20:56.244 --> 20:58.452
Don't move.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.113
You have no idea

21:01.114 --> 21:03.771
who you're dealing with.
Pieter Smit.

21:03.773 --> 21:07.012
Born December 19, 1972,
Kroonstad, South Africa.

21:07.014 --> 21:09.388
Mother was Mary,
father was also Peter.

21:09.390 --> 21:11.632
You served in...
What do you want?

21:12.498 --> 21:14.624
We just want to talk.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.400
Not interested.
Well, we can

21:17.402 --> 21:19.511
do this the easy way
or we can do it the hard way.

21:19.513 --> 21:21.671
Go to hell.

21:21.673 --> 21:23.682
That would be the hard way.

21:25.163 --> 21:27.870
Waaldt should've
called back by now.

21:27.872 --> 21:28.950
You don't have to yell.

21:28.952 --> 21:30.779
I'm not talking
to you.

21:34.303 --> 21:35.964
Hey. Stay in the bedroom.

21:35.966 --> 21:38.175
I'm closing this.
Stay in the bedroom.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.225
Kens, somebody's here.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.729
Oh, you've got

21:45.731 --> 21:48.265
to be kidding me.

21:48.267 --> 21:50.984
Hi. Who are you?

21:50.986 --> 21:52.102
Kelly Lang, neighborhood watch.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.320
We've gotten
reports concerning

21:53.322 --> 21:54.905
some suspicious
and lewd behavior

21:54.907 --> 21:56.439
coming from
this residence.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.475
She's in the bedroom.

21:58.477 --> 22:00.493
Oh, where she does some
of her finest work, I'm sure.

22:00.495 --> 22:02.496
Thank God. She's gonna hear you.

22:02.498 --> 22:05.082
Good!
Callen and Sam have

22:05.084 --> 22:07.149
the guy that tried
to kill you both.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.086
They think she might
help turn him,

22:09.088 --> 22:10.621
and if Waaldt's traced
her phone,

22:10.623 --> 22:12.155
the safe house
is no longer safe.

22:12.157 --> 22:13.707
God, I hate this part.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.492
What, the part where
you have to say

22:15.494 --> 22:16.543
everything was a lie?

22:16.545 --> 22:18.177
That you're a big fat liar?
That part?

22:18.179 --> 22:20.547
Don't do that. Don't gloat.

22:20.549 --> 22:21.548
I'm not gloating.

22:21.550 --> 22:22.833
You're gloating
a little bit.

22:22.835 --> 22:23.934
I wasn't gloating.

22:23.936 --> 22:25.184
It's a little unbecoming,
actually.

22:26.355 --> 22:27.671
Monica!

22:29.941 --> 22:32.276
Monica?

22:35.346 --> 22:36.971
Where is she?

22:37.657 --> 22:38.632
No.

22:50.638 --> 22:52.915
Should have seen that coming.

23:15.443 --> 23:16.629
If I had known
we were going swimming,

23:16.630 --> 23:17.961
I would have packed
my swimming trunks.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.076
You're funny.

23:20.078 --> 23:21.459
He's funny.

23:21.461 --> 23:23.768
I don't think he's funny.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.119
Don't take that
personally.

23:25.121 --> 23:27.022
He's only happy
if he's hurting somebody.

23:27.024 --> 23:29.658
Good cop, bad cop?

23:29.660 --> 23:31.122
That's the best you got?

23:31.124 --> 23:32.391
I don't know.
I mean, those

23:32.393 --> 23:35.059
are two of our better routines.
What else do we have?

23:35.061 --> 23:38.020
We have the girl
he tried to kill.

23:38.022 --> 23:40.103
We have the girl.
Which one?

23:40.105 --> 23:43.341
There's been a couple got away,
but not many.

23:43.343 --> 23:45.862
Now that's funny.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.107
No?

23:48.109 --> 23:50.466
Tough audience.

23:50.468 --> 23:52.287
I'll tell you what else we have.

23:52.289 --> 23:55.460
We have...

23:55.462 --> 23:57.055
your boss's diamonds.

23:57.057 --> 23:59.202
Congratulations.

24:06.930 --> 24:10.134
Hang out. We'll get more
acquainted later.

24:15.195 --> 24:17.505
What do you got, Eric?

24:17.507 --> 24:18.724
Okay, it's all good,

24:18.726 --> 24:20.514
but Monica Davis escaped.

24:20.516 --> 24:21.705
How?

24:21.707 --> 24:23.129
Out a window, I think.

24:23.131 --> 24:24.354
And she's got the diamonds.

24:24.356 --> 24:27.483
And this is
all good because...?

24:27.485 --> 24:29.502
Because we're tracking
her cell phone

24:29.504 --> 24:31.638
and Kensi and Deeks
are following her.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.930
She make any calls?

24:32.932 --> 24:34.418
Not yet.
Keep it that way.

24:34.420 --> 24:36.107
Don't let her receive
any incoming either.

24:36.109 --> 24:37.282
Let us know if Waaldt tries
to reach her again.

24:37.284 --> 24:39.384
I'm on it.
Any word from Granger?

24:39.386 --> 24:40.576
Nope.

24:40.578 --> 24:42.397
Of course not.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.053
Keep us informed.

24:44.055 --> 24:46.387
Will do.

24:46.389 --> 24:48.456
Eric, how far now?

24:48.458 --> 24:52.164
Uh, she's about half a block
ahead of you on the left.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.372
She's not moving.

24:53.374 --> 24:55.028
I can't believe she
double-crossed me.

24:55.030 --> 24:56.286
Yeah, just when
you were about

24:56.288 --> 24:58.140
to live your life happily
ever after in <i>luxury.</i>

24:58.142 --> 24:59.381
She played you.

24:59.383 --> 25:01.153
She's actually not
that bad. She just...

25:01.155 --> 25:02.394
Has poor judgment?
Exactly.

25:02.396 --> 25:03.802
Like her taste in men.

25:03.804 --> 25:06.119
Oh, see? See, what
you tried to do right there,

25:06.121 --> 25:07.443
but it's not gonna work

25:07.445 --> 25:09.148
'cause she wasn't
actually involved with me.

25:09.150 --> 25:11.249
She was involved with
my alter ego Max Gentry.

25:11.251 --> 25:13.518
Hang on a second.
Not your undercover legend?

25:13.520 --> 25:15.223
You know, that's
what I meant.

25:15.225 --> 25:16.890
No, no, no,
you said alter ego.

25:16.892 --> 25:18.223
That's completely
different.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.890
Superheroes have alter egos.

25:19.892 --> 25:21.840
No, no, superheroes have
secret identities.

25:21.842 --> 25:25.390
Schizophrenics have alter egos,
like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

25:25.392 --> 25:27.007
Or you when you haven't
had chocolate

25:27.009 --> 25:28.273
or during your lady phase.

25:28.275 --> 25:29.524
Shut up.

25:29.526 --> 25:32.024
Ooh, speaking of crazy women.

25:33.859 --> 25:35.141
All right, stay here.

25:35.143 --> 25:37.441
Why am I staying here?

25:37.443 --> 25:39.274
Um, maybe because
if she sees you

25:39.276 --> 25:40.891
she's gonna want to run again
like most women.

25:40.893 --> 25:42.058
Except for you.

25:42.060 --> 25:43.808
You don't run from me.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.476
That's because I carry a gun.
Now make yourself useful

25:46.478 --> 25:47.892
and back me up.

25:47.894 --> 25:50.142
I'll just be here
holding your purse.

25:50.144 --> 25:52.225
Eric, call Monica's phone.

25:52.227 --> 25:53.858
On it.

25:56.944 --> 25:58.392
Yeah?

25:58.394 --> 26:02.275
Hello? Hello?

26:02.277 --> 26:03.860
I think they hung up.

26:07.010 --> 26:09.011
NCIS.

26:09.013 --> 26:10.113
What?

26:10.115 --> 26:12.882
Too many letters?
Federal agent.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.788
Back off, bitch. I mean it.

26:22.660 --> 26:24.460
Freeze!

26:25.996 --> 26:28.464
Max, what are you doing?
Shoot her!

26:28.466 --> 26:29.832
Sorry, honey,

26:29.834 --> 26:31.834
he's with me.

26:33.036 --> 26:37.039
And his real name is
Marty Deeks, and he's a cop,

26:37.041 --> 26:38.708
and he's my partner.

26:38.710 --> 26:41.928
Who's the bitch now?

26:41.930 --> 26:43.563
He is.

26:44.982 --> 26:48.050
Can't argue with that.

26:54.490 --> 26:56.776
Aren't you even
a little bit curious

26:56.778 --> 26:58.728
as to why we brought
you here?

26:58.730 --> 27:00.663
I'm assuming
it's to kill me.

27:00.665 --> 27:04.167
That's just defeatist.

27:04.169 --> 27:06.902
What was your boss gonna do
with the diamonds?

27:06.904 --> 27:08.920
A tiara.

27:08.922 --> 27:12.709
I think you got a smirk
out of him.

27:12.711 --> 27:14.343
It was subtle.

27:14.345 --> 27:16.506
I mean, you'd have to know him
better to see it, but...

27:17.464 --> 27:20.850
Look, I'm not gonna kill you.
He might, but I won't.

27:20.852 --> 27:23.351
I don't even care
about the diamonds.

27:23.353 --> 27:26.389
I just want to know what they
were being used for.

27:28.826 --> 27:30.149
Ask my boss.

27:30.151 --> 27:34.642
I would, but he's not here,
you are.

27:34.644 --> 27:36.804
And I'm not telling you
anything,

27:36.806 --> 27:39.587
so you might as well go ahead
and drown me.

27:41.549 --> 27:44.615
We're not gonna drown you.

27:44.617 --> 27:47.683
No, he still has
to feed the fish.

27:50.064 --> 27:51.186
Did you see that?

27:51.188 --> 27:54.505
He smiled.
Now he's happy.

27:54.508 --> 27:55.746
Finally.

28:01.331 --> 28:04.061
Okay. I guess I'll
get some lunch.

28:04.063 --> 28:06.358
What are you thinking,
fish tacos?

28:06.360 --> 28:08.537
I'm not hungry.
Still? Hmm.

28:08.539 --> 28:09.928
How about you?

28:09.930 --> 28:11.639
He shouldn't eat.

28:11.641 --> 28:13.063
Hmm. Okay.

28:13.065 --> 28:16.668
All right, you let me know
when you're all done.

28:19.049 --> 28:21.110
He was brokering a deal.

28:21.112 --> 28:22.367
I'm sorry?

28:22.369 --> 28:25.301
Waaldt was brokering
a deal.

28:25.303 --> 28:27.429
The diamonds
were payment.

28:27.431 --> 28:28.788
For what?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.162
I don't know.

28:30.164 --> 28:31.174
Who's the buyer?

28:31.176 --> 28:32.811
I don't know.

28:32.813 --> 28:34.287
Is it Bernosoni?
The guy from the club today?

28:34.289 --> 28:37.305
No. Bernosoni was negotiating
for the seller.

28:37.307 --> 28:39.038
Who's the seller?
I don't know.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.001
You don't know much, do you?

28:40.003 --> 28:41.928
I know he was Russian.

28:43.164 --> 28:47.128
A Russian is selling something
for $10 million?

28:47.130 --> 28:49.423
How do you know the
seller was Russian?

28:49.425 --> 28:51.305
Because he was speaking
in Russian.

28:51.306 --> 28:51.831
When?

28:51.832 --> 28:54.510
A few weeks ago he came by
the club one time.

28:54.512 --> 28:56.116
You saw him?

28:56.118 --> 29:00.947
Yeah... I saw him.

29:05.281 --> 29:07.158
The Russian you saw
with Bernosoni...

29:07.160 --> 29:10.417
he one of these guys?

29:12.103 --> 29:13.578
That one.

29:16.982 --> 29:18.635
That's him.

29:18.637 --> 29:20.914
Isaak Sidorov.

29:37.412 --> 29:39.209
What kind of police station
is this?

29:39.211 --> 29:40.494
The kind you
don't ask about.

29:40.496 --> 29:41.794
Sit!

29:41.796 --> 29:43.832
Seriously, you're not gonna
say anything?

29:43.834 --> 29:46.127
I got nothing to say.

29:46.129 --> 29:47.395
Yeah.

29:47.397 --> 29:48.936
Yeah.

29:52.019 --> 29:53.852
What's he doing here?

29:53.854 --> 29:55.021
Same thing you are.

29:55.023 --> 29:56.489
Next time I won't miss.

29:56.491 --> 29:58.024
Shut up and keep moving.

29:59.994 --> 30:02.094
The diamonds she stole
were to broker a deal

30:02.118 --> 30:03.781
with Isaak Sidorov.

30:03.782 --> 30:05.231
Are you
kidding me?

30:05.233 --> 30:06.331
Who's the buyer?

30:06.333 --> 30:07.667
Smit doesn't know.

30:07.669 --> 30:09.702
Well, did anybody recognize Sam
as David Forman

30:09.704 --> 30:11.171
or mention Quinn?

30:11.173 --> 30:12.405
No. Their covers are intact.

30:12.407 --> 30:14.090
Picked Sidorov out
of a photo array.

30:14.092 --> 30:15.908
Said Sidorov meet face-to-face
with his boss, Waaldt.

30:15.910 --> 30:18.077
Holy crap,
this is huge.

30:18.079 --> 30:19.379
Okay, so what do we do now?

30:19.381 --> 30:22.098
We make a plan... and fast.

30:25.937 --> 30:28.721
Johannes Waaldt was brokering
a deal with Bernosoni

30:28.723 --> 30:30.590
using $10-million
worth of blood diamonds

30:30.592 --> 30:33.443
to buy one or more
of Sidorov's nuclear bombs

30:33.445 --> 30:34.611
for an unknown buyer.

30:34.613 --> 30:36.729
I'd bet more
like $12 million.

30:36.731 --> 30:38.631
What's a couple of million
dollars amongst friends, huh?

30:38.633 --> 30:40.483
Well, Waaldt's gonna
need some serious coin

30:40.485 --> 30:42.319
to cover that kind of loss.

30:42.321 --> 30:44.988
You know, by now, he must be
wondering where Smit is.

30:46.073 --> 30:47.625
Maybe we can convince Waaldt

30:47.628 --> 30:49.295
that Smit and Monica
stole the diamonds together.

30:49.297 --> 30:50.663
I know

30:50.665 --> 30:52.749
somebody that can make
that story stick.

30:52.751 --> 30:53.784
You think she'll play ball?

30:53.786 --> 30:56.223
She won't want to,

30:56.225 --> 30:59.293
but she'll do it.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.857
I told you things
I never told anybody else.

31:07.859 --> 31:10.762
We did things I never did
with anybody else.

31:10.764 --> 31:14.619
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.
That was Max.

31:15.487 --> 31:18.373
I risked my life for you.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.068
I never asked you
to steal the diamonds.

31:20.093 --> 31:21.264
Well, you took advantage of me.

31:21.265 --> 31:23.182
As I recall, you're the one
that tried to rip me off.

31:23.184 --> 31:25.835
I thought
you were getting cold feet.

31:25.837 --> 31:28.524
I was doing that for us.
Just to be

31:28.526 --> 31:32.012
perfectly clear, I never
forced you to do anything.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.606
Keep telling yourself that.

31:43.799 --> 31:46.803
So what now?

31:46.805 --> 31:49.223
So what now is,
you have a choice.

31:49.225 --> 31:53.514
This is your third
strike. Yeah?

31:53.516 --> 31:56.686
And you stole millions of
dollars of merchandise,

31:56.688 --> 31:58.322
you assaulted a
federal officer.

31:58.324 --> 32:01.559
And with your record,
you're looking at 25 to life.

32:01.561 --> 32:03.530
Oh, just cut to the chase.

32:03.532 --> 32:04.865
Just tell me the truth for once.

32:04.867 --> 32:06.368
Work with us.

32:06.370 --> 32:10.872
Help us make the diamond
exchange with Waaldt.

32:10.874 --> 32:12.457
And if it leads to his arrest,

32:12.459 --> 32:14.242
and the arrest of Sidorov,
you get to walk away free.

32:14.244 --> 32:15.711
That's it?

32:15.713 --> 32:17.212
It's that simple.

32:17.214 --> 32:18.347
Oh, screw simple.

32:18.349 --> 32:20.015
What about a reward
for the diamonds?

32:20.017 --> 32:22.633
I mean, they got
to be worth something.

32:22.635 --> 32:25.354
God bless you.
Always the hustler.

32:27.590 --> 32:29.923
Yeah, takes one
to know one.

32:29.925 --> 32:32.778
Fair enough.

32:32.780 --> 32:35.997
Why should I believe
a word you say?

32:40.236 --> 32:43.404
'Cause I'm the one telling you,
not Max.

32:45.408 --> 32:47.743
Yeah.

32:47.745 --> 32:50.378
And your imaginary friend,
Max Gentry,

32:50.380 --> 32:54.149
absolves you
of all guilt.

32:54.151 --> 32:57.636
"It wasn't me, it was Max."

32:59.454 --> 33:01.840
So lucky
to have a friend like Max.

33:01.842 --> 33:04.259
Are you done?

33:06.145 --> 33:07.962
Yeah.

33:07.964 --> 33:10.565
So what's it gonna be, Monica?

33:13.336 --> 33:15.637
What do I have to do?

33:15.639 --> 33:18.156
Call Waaldt.

33:18.158 --> 33:20.442
You tell him it was Smit's idea,

33:20.444 --> 33:22.643
and he tried to kill you,
he tried to double-cross you,

33:22.645 --> 33:23.862
and now you're scared.

33:23.864 --> 33:26.197
You tell him you
have the diamonds,

33:26.199 --> 33:30.035
and you'll give them back
for $100,000 in cash.

33:30.037 --> 33:32.486
Give him an hour to meet you
at the LA Music Center

33:32.488 --> 33:34.587
with the cash,

33:34.589 --> 33:36.288
or you'll find another buyer.

33:36.290 --> 33:39.290
Don't suppose I get to keep
the cash after we're done?

33:40.157 --> 33:42.008
What do you think?

33:44.762 --> 33:46.411
You can tell
your buddies I'm in.

33:46.413 --> 33:50.046
But I'm asking Waaldt
for $250,000.

33:50.048 --> 33:52.131
I might be scared,
but I'm not stupid.

33:52.134 --> 33:54.683
Love it.

34:25.686 --> 34:28.737
She's all yours.

34:32.074 --> 34:34.706
Kensi...

34:36.125 --> 34:37.742
Let him go.

34:41.829 --> 34:44.195
You're up, Kens.

34:56.754 --> 34:58.338
Tuck.

35:01.257 --> 35:03.807
You know, you have
a pretty sweet right cross.

35:03.809 --> 35:06.726
Thanks. I can tell
you've studied Krav Maga.

35:06.728 --> 35:09.394
You know, I used to have a thing
for buff Israeli guys.

35:09.396 --> 35:12.213
You know what
I was thinking?

35:12.215 --> 35:13.764
What?

35:13.766 --> 35:17.516
That you and I should take off
with the diamonds.

35:17.518 --> 35:19.100
We'd make a pretty sexy team,

35:19.102 --> 35:21.184
and no one would mess with us.

35:21.186 --> 35:24.053
And I'd cut you in for half.

35:26.522 --> 35:29.056
That was a joke.

35:33.944 --> 35:37.067
So...

35:37.069 --> 35:40.546
I got Max Gentry,

35:40.548 --> 35:43.137
but you get the real deal.

35:43.139 --> 35:44.943
How's that?

35:44.945 --> 35:46.196
Deeks is my partner.

35:46.198 --> 35:48.268
And that's it?

35:48.270 --> 35:49.540
That's enough.

35:49.542 --> 35:50.743
Is it?

35:52.498 --> 35:55.056
You know you can't trust him.

36:00.407 --> 36:02.444
I trust him with everything.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.161
You're a bigger fool
than I thought.

36:08.163 --> 36:09.548
Everything he did,

36:09.550 --> 36:12.107
he did it
to establish his cover.

36:12.109 --> 36:14.948
A cover that saved you,

36:14.950 --> 36:17.522
and that will save
a lot of other lives.

36:17.524 --> 36:19.713
I'm not worried about the past.

36:19.715 --> 36:21.167
Any of it.

36:22.038 --> 36:24.260
I mean, why would you be?

36:24.262 --> 36:26.734
You're just his partner, right?

36:29.559 --> 36:31.030
Bye.
Good luck out there.

36:31.032 --> 36:32.418
Hmm.

37:17.721 --> 37:19.726
Any sign of Waaldt?

37:19.728 --> 37:20.762
I got nothing.

37:20.764 --> 37:21.850
Nope.

37:21.852 --> 37:22.986
Nope.

37:22.988 --> 37:24.717
Eric?

37:24.719 --> 37:26.398
Nothing yet.

37:26.399 --> 37:28.345
And Waaldt's phone
is turned off,

37:28.347 --> 37:29.976
so we have no idea
where he is.

37:35.969 --> 37:38.000
He's coming around the fountain.

37:38.002 --> 37:40.130
He's got a briefcase.

37:51.366 --> 37:52.363
Is that my money?

37:52.365 --> 37:54.778
Blunt and crass.

37:54.780 --> 37:57.357
What should I expect
from a waitress?

37:57.359 --> 37:58.305
I was a hostess.

37:58.307 --> 38:00.470
You put the "ho" in hostess.

38:00.472 --> 38:02.001
And now you're a thief.

38:02.003 --> 38:03.050
It takes one to know one.

38:03.052 --> 38:04.714
Ooh, clever.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.262
Where are my diamonds?

38:13.004 --> 38:14.668
Okay, that's enough.
Hey, hey.

38:17.332 --> 38:19.445
Don't tell me you're gonna count that.
No, I trust you.

38:19.447 --> 38:21.275
Something I'll never do again.

38:21.277 --> 38:23.273
I'm not here alone.

38:25.188 --> 38:26.802
Neither am I.

38:29.017 --> 38:30.363
Gun!

38:30.365 --> 38:31.628
Monica!

38:37.339 --> 38:38.952
Freeze!

38:39.619 --> 38:40.834
I got him!
Monica! Monica!

38:40.835 --> 38:42.215
Stay down.

38:42.217 --> 38:43.446
You're okay.

38:43.448 --> 38:44.445
You're okay, just breathe.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.208
Just breathe.

38:50.073 --> 38:51.902
I would have been better off
with Max.

38:56.697 --> 38:57.981
Kens...

38:57.983 --> 39:00.734
Eric, I'm gonna need
two ambulances.

39:01.952 --> 39:03.235
Oh...

39:19.252 --> 39:20.720
Hey.

39:20.722 --> 39:22.338
Hey, you're still here.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.639
Yeah.

39:23.641 --> 39:25.424
How come?

39:25.426 --> 39:26.976
I, uh... couldn't find you.

39:26.979 --> 39:28.311
You didn't pick
up your phone.

39:28.313 --> 39:30.479
Must have left it in my car.

39:30.481 --> 39:32.849
Hetty wanted me
to give you this.

39:32.851 --> 39:35.602
Okay.

39:38.105 --> 39:39.656
How's Monica?

39:39.658 --> 39:41.907
Um...

39:41.909 --> 39:43.492
She's sore.

39:43.494 --> 39:45.829
Obviously lucky.

39:48.416 --> 39:50.367
How's Waaldt?

39:50.369 --> 39:53.035
Waaldt lawyered up
in the ambulance,

39:53.037 --> 39:54.453
and he hasn't said a word.

39:54.455 --> 39:56.756
Literally, a word.

39:56.758 --> 39:58.158
Well, maybe he'll
change his mind.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.491
Yeah, who knows.

40:00.961 --> 40:02.878
So, I was...
Listen, I...

40:02.880 --> 40:03.979
Sorry, go ahead, I wasn't...

40:03.981 --> 40:05.381
No, please.

40:05.383 --> 40:09.335
I was just gonna see
if you were good.

40:11.337 --> 40:12.855
Yeah.

40:14.307 --> 40:16.124
You?

40:16.126 --> 40:18.008
I mean, I'm good if you're good.

40:19.860 --> 40:21.450
I'm good.

40:24.568 --> 40:26.483
Okay.

40:26.485 --> 40:27.620
Good.

40:27.622 --> 40:29.535
We're good.

40:29.537 --> 40:31.483
Which is, you know...

40:31.485 --> 40:33.383
great.

40:33.385 --> 40:36.387
Glad we cleared that up.

40:40.366 --> 40:41.582
See you tomorrow.

41:00.222 --> 41:02.364
"Sunshine and gunpowder."
