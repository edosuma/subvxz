00:05.805 --> 00:08.574
( <i>Rufus grunts</i>)

00:08.576 --> 00:10.709
Okay, I've been studying
the dating habits

00:10.711 --> 00:12.644
of Middleton's
most desirable females.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.546
Rufus, the visual aids, please.

00:15.648 --> 00:17.616
A distinct pattern emerges.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.718
I'm guessing this pattern
doesn't include you.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.619
Correct!

00:20.621 --> 00:22.121
It does, however, involve:

00:22.123 --> 00:23.689
the captain of the
basketball team,

00:23.691 --> 00:25.057
the captain of
the football team,

00:25.059 --> 00:26.658
the captain of the judo team.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.161
Thus leading to my
groundbreaking conclusion:

00:29.163 --> 00:31.597
"Girls Dig Guys
Who Play Sports."

00:31.599 --> 00:32.998
Mm-hmm!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.768
I could've saved you
a lot of time on that one.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.236
It's so simple!

00:37.238 --> 00:39.204
All I need to do
is become a jock!

00:39.206 --> 00:41.306
It's my one-way ticket
to Hottieville.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.708
You don't even play
a sport, Ron.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.909
I mean...

00:43.911 --> 00:45.978
what team could you
possibly try out for?

00:45.980 --> 00:47.613

Yeah, but I hope
fencing's first,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.016
'cause these tights
really itch.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.120
Good news, Junior.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.088
I have hired
a financial consultant.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.756
Meet Vincent Wheeler.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.225
Call me Vinnie.
How ya doin', kid?

02:06.227 --> 02:08.160
Whoa! That's some grip
you got there.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.194
You work out, I bet.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.929
What do you bench...
two bills?

02:10.931 --> 02:14.833
Mr. Wheeler is going to
manage our enormous fortune,

02:14.835 --> 02:18.737
so we can focus full-time
on our evil activities.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.073
Mr. Wheeler, come on,
we're all family here.

02:21.075 --> 02:23.208
Vinnie! Please!

02:23.210 --> 02:26.211
Junior, show Mr. Vinnie
our financial portfolios.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.713
But I was going
to practice my...

02:27.715 --> 02:29.348
Now, Junior.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.685
Hey, Junior, did you realize

02:33.687 --> 02:36.088
all of your dad's holdings
are also in your name.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.123
I hear words coming
out of your mouth

02:38.125 --> 02:39.725
that mean nothing to me.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.093
Let me lay it out for you:

02:41.095 --> 02:42.027
all these numbers...

02:42.029 --> 02:43.896
make my head hurt.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.365
Well, here's an idea, Slick.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.168
You could just sign over
power of attorney to me.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.937
Oh! More words I do not
understand.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.239
You sign these papers
and I step in...

02:54.241 --> 02:55.741
bingo, bango, just like that...

02:55.743 --> 02:57.709
it's all on me, burden lifted.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.446
No more numbers, no more words
I do not understand?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.017
And you know what, kiddo?

03:05.019 --> 03:06.685
Why don't you just
go ahead and jot down

03:06.687 --> 03:09.054
all of your bank access
codes while you're at it.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.291
There is only one objective:

03:12.293 --> 03:14.259
that's to crush your opponent

03:14.261 --> 03:17.829
until they go crying
home to mama.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.065
Now let's have some fun
out there, people!

03:21.167 --> 03:22.528

This could get ugly.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.707
That's right!

03:28.709 --> 03:29.474
Uh-huh!

03:29.476 --> 03:30.475

03:30.477 --> 03:32.110

03:39.987 --> 03:41.820
Ron, can you hear me?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.089
I can't feel my legs.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.759
Rufus, how many sports are there
at Middleton High?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.362
( <i>trilling loudly</i> )

04:20.761 --> 04:23.262
One week's supply of Le Goop
hair product.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.131
Pick a card, my sweet stuff.

04:28.801 --> 04:30.302
( <i>alarm beeping</i> )
I'm sorry, monsieur,

04:30.304 --> 04:31.837

Father, what is the meaning
of all this?

04:51.525 --> 04:53.959
Are we moving into a bigger,
more extravagant home?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.527
No, Junior.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.263
Mr. Vinnie has
taken everything.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.433
You signed it over to him...
our entire fortune!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.201
You have ruined us!

scare me like that!

to wake you up.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.446
The jock dream is over, K.P.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.449
The express train to Hottieville
left me standing at the station.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.151
Don't take it too hard, Ron.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.419
No one can say you're a quitter.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.054
True.
You didn't stop

05:22.056 --> 05:23.255
until you were rejected

05:23.257 --> 05:25.424
from every sport
at Middleton High.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.092
Wait... that didn't
come out right.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.494

sorrows in a Slurpster.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.004
Hey, Kim.
How's our Olympian?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.272
He'll live.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.008
More or less.

05:43.010 --> 05:43.842
What's the sitch?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.277
Rash of robberies...

05:45.279 --> 05:46.945
four in the last couple weeks.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.181
And whoever it is,
they've got some serious moves.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.382
Check the footage.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.121
Hello, show-off.

06:01.961 --> 06:02.928
Wait a sec, Wade.

06:02.930 --> 06:03.895
Can you back up that last clip

06:03.897 --> 06:05.297
and slow it?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.033
Nice catch, Kim.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.335
Let me do some
digital enhancing.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.173
"Five, five, five."

06:15.175 --> 06:16.341
That guy's got
his stuff dialed!

06:16.343 --> 06:17.442
Check the temper tantrum

06:17.444 --> 06:19.177
and the inverted cinnamon
twisty roll!

06:19.179 --> 06:22.347
Okay, you lost me when you hit
the baked goods reference.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.984
they're competition class.
Who that?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.185
I wish I knew.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.421
He's our bad guy du jour.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.357
Whoever he is, he's definitely
an action sports pro.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.259
Those moves are right out
of the X Games.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.261
The X Games, huh?

06:37.463 --> 06:38.964
Monique was right, Kim.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.298
These are the last four cities

06:40.300 --> 06:42.033
on the Top Action Sports Tour.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.070
They're also the sights
of all four of our robberies.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.305
The tour ends this weekend
at the X Games.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.508
Sounds like a good place
to start.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.721
So all we need to do is find

07:02.723 --> 07:05.690
a dude with "555" tatttoed
on the back of his neck.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.192
I don't know.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.960
It looks like a lot of necks.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.997
Where do we start: bike stunt,
skateboard, Moto X?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.298
First things first, K.P.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.633
Rufus and I are gonna check out

07:14.635 --> 07:16.535
the action snack-tion.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.045
How's it rollin', ladies!

07:27.047 --> 07:28.580
Not even a glance.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.949
Is it that obvious I'm
athletically lacking?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.484
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

07:32.486 --> 07:33.652
How about some shade, pal?

07:33.654 --> 07:36.087
You know how you burn...
hey, hey, hey!

07:40.360 --> 07:42.294
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:42.296 --> 07:43.962
Awesome!

07:43.964 --> 07:46.398
Not... gonna... hurl...

08:19.232 --> 08:21.766
( <i>crowd cheering and shouting</i>)

08:21.768 --> 08:24.669
I'm standing here with
the founder of a new sport

08:24.671 --> 08:27.672
just debuted at the X Games:
Umbrella surfing.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.108
Uh, no, actually,
that was an accident.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.409
I didn't even mean...

08:31.411 --> 08:34.279
( <i>girls giggling</i> )

08:34.281 --> 08:36.414
That was totally the sickest
athletic expo I've ever seen.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.650
Yes! Sick! Yeah.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.652
I'm the sickest athlete
you'll see on the circuit.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.587
Yo.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.456
KIM: If I was a daring
action sports bandit,

08:44.458 --> 08:46.458
where would I be?

08:52.632 --> 08:54.065
( <i>crowd screaming</i> )

08:56.802 --> 08:58.203
Hey, look out!

08:58.205 --> 09:00.238
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

09:00.240 --> 09:02.674
Whoa, you almost got smashed.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.543
What's up... I'm Ryan;
Ryan Nyquist.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.177
Whew! Thanks, Ryan.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.579
Kim Possible.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.181
Are obstacles usually
that, um... extreme?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.483
Accidents happen.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.185
That was no accident.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.321
Check out tall, dark
and busted.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.334
Ah...!

09:35.074 --> 09:36.308
( <i>shouts</i> )

09:43.583 --> 09:44.716
Sorry!

09:49.422 --> 09:50.589
( <i>gasps</i> )

10:00.399 --> 10:02.334
You're intense...
even by my standards.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.169
Story of my life.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.539
Well, that's one down.

10:10.209 --> 10:11.643
Umbrella surfing?!

10:11.645 --> 10:14.279
So, guys, I'm working on a
little somethin'-somethin'

10:14.281 --> 10:15.580
to add to my bag o' tricks.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.815
What if... ooh.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.283
What are you doing?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.284
Oh, hey, K.P.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.652
Just speaking a little
shred-onics

10:20.654 --> 10:21.886
with my fellow athletes:

10:21.888 --> 10:24.322
Bob Burnquist,
skateboarding king,

10:24.324 --> 10:26.524
Dallas Friday, wakeboard maven,

10:26.526 --> 10:28.426
and Trevor Vine, Moto X madman.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.562
I'm sorry, did you say
"fellow athletes"?

10:30.564 --> 10:32.530
Word, Kim.
I guess you missed

10:32.532 --> 10:34.666
my new sport expo...
umbrella surfing.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.868
It's kinda, you know,
"the thing" right now.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.271
I was busy getting crushed on...
by a giant pipe.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.306
We have to find this guy, Ron,

10:41.308 --> 10:42.507
before he tries again.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.442
Chill, K.P.
I'm still on the job.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.577
These three are clean.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.345
No 555 in sight.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.548
Well, that's the last of them.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.587
Whoa, Ron... what's with
the fashion blindness?

10:55.589 --> 10:56.788
Pretty sweet, huh?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.256
It's from my new sponsor.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.891
Hold up...
someone is actually

10:59.893 --> 11:02.627
giving you money
to endorse their equipment?

11:02.629 --> 11:05.363
Not just equipment...
mini-corn dogs, too!

11:08.834 --> 11:10.902
Mmm! Corn dogs!

11:10.904 --> 11:13.505
Kim, this jock thing is
even better than I dreamed!

11:13.507 --> 11:15.306
I'm a phenom with the ladies!

11:15.308 --> 11:16.474
What's up, Molly?

11:16.476 --> 11:17.876
Let's chill later.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.778
Katie, Hannah, call me.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.279
You want?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.248
Pass. I promised Monique

11:23.250 --> 11:24.549
I'd score her a t-shirt.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.687
Hi.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.321
One medium size...
( <i>gasps</i>)

11:30.323 --> 11:31.956
Kim Possible.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.591
This one is on the house,
of course.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.561
This is so many levels
of not right.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.596
Why, hello!

11:38.598 --> 11:40.699
Could it be that you
cannot resist watching Junior

11:40.701 --> 11:42.500
in a high-action competition?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.635
Competing?

11:43.637 --> 11:44.769
You're an X Gamer?

11:44.771 --> 11:45.970
No way.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.539
You're not even in the program.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.841
I refuse to pose
for the program photograph.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.543
The lighting did not
do me justice.

11:52.845 --> 11:55.213
The two of you can consider
yourselves busted.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.348
Busted?
For selling T-shirts

11:57.350 --> 11:59.250
and competing in the games?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.853
We are just
poor common folk now.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.322
Puh-leese.
Don't even play that with me.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.524
It's true.
We lost all of our fortune.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.593
And now what, you're
trying to steal it back?

12:08.595 --> 12:10.862
No. We are working hard
to make an honest living.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.430
You must understand.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.965
Money has no meaning to us.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.867
Now we're rich in moral fiber

12:15.869 --> 12:17.769
rather than material
possessions.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.537
Come, I'll show you.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.573
Welcome to our paradise.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.641
He went from owning his own
private island to this?

12:23.643 --> 12:25.343
The island

12:25.345 --> 12:28.012
was actually very impractical
in the monsoon season.

12:28.014 --> 12:31.416
With our new simplistic life,
we want for nothing.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.952
Please, come in.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.755
Here are the vegetables
we grow ourselves.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.591
Here is where Junior
spins the cotton fiber

12:39.593 --> 12:40.525
to make our clothing.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.693
And here is where I

12:41.695 --> 12:44.395
collect the rainwater
that we drink.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.899
It is a simple life,
but it is a good life.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.501
And you don't miss being

12:49.503 --> 12:51.402
billionaire super villains
at all?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.271
I thought I might, but I do not.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.639
Would you like a cookie?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.007
I churned the butter myself.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.742
JUNIOR:
None for me, Father.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.711
I am preparing for my big
bike stunt competition.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.282
Well, I guess we
better be getting back.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.416
But, uh...

13:05.418 --> 13:07.619
thanks for the T-shirt.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.054
I don't know, Ron.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.357
They actually seemed happy.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.993
Come on, K.P., how do you buy
happiness without money?

13:14.995 --> 13:16.561
( <i>phone rings</i>) Hey, Wade.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.595
What up, Kim?

13:17.597 --> 13:18.630
You find our guy yet?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.431
No love.
Anything on your end?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.600
I found a connection
between all of the robberies.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.803
All of the companies hit
are owned by one man...

13:24.805 --> 13:26.805
Vincent Wheeler a.k.a. Vinnie.

13:26.807 --> 13:27.739
Keep talking.

13:27.741 --> 13:28.773
Get this...

13:28.775 --> 13:30.408
Wheeler was a financial advisor.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.777
He got all his money by stealing
it from his rich clients

13:32.779 --> 13:34.045
including...

13:34.047 --> 13:35.046
The Seniors.

13:35.048 --> 13:35.947
Bingo.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.349
It is Junior.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.018
He's trying to steal
back the family fortune.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.985
The bike stunt expo.

13:41.921 --> 13:44.389
Oh! Easy, ladies!

13:44.391 --> 13:45.924
Plenty of Ron to go around.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.926
Here you go, man.
Time to rock and roll.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.627
Make us proud, bro.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.897
( <i>yelling</i> )

13:52.899 --> 13:54.098
Oh, whoa! Hey!

13:54.100 --> 13:55.700
Wait a sec! ( <i>yells</i> )

13:55.702 --> 13:57.769
It's time for the new
sports exhibition.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.070
Are you amped?!

13:59.072 --> 14:01.472
What? Wait.
N... hold up.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.541
A professional athlete
needs his rest.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.577
You know, get in the zone?

14:06.946 --> 14:08.580
I'll be watching.

14:08.582 --> 14:09.681
But, I...

14:09.683 --> 14:11.583
can't...!

14:16.522 --> 14:18.356
Junior, stop!

14:28.434 --> 14:31.536
( <i>crowd booing</i>)

14:34.740 --> 14:36.975
Ooh, not pretty.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.643
( <i>yelps</i> )

14:40.012 --> 14:42.413
He's... He's terrible.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.849
( <i>whimpers</i>)

14:44.851 --> 14:45.850
How did I score?

14:45.852 --> 14:47.719
Nice try, Junior.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.021
I know you're just tanking this
event to try and throw me off.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.456
Throw you off what?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.791
I've seen the tapes
of the robberies, Junior.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.060
I know you've got
pro-caliber X Game skills.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.795
I welcome that,

14:57.797 --> 14:59.564
and any other compliments
you might have for me.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.633
But I have no idea what
you're talking about.

15:01.635 --> 15:02.634
Really?

15:02.636 --> 15:04.235
Then explain this!

15:04.237 --> 15:07.472
Why are you stretching
out my jersey?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.849
Just making sure you
didn't cover that tattoo

15:17.851 --> 15:18.917
with makeup or something.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.418
Ha! I never wear makeup.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.420
Well, perhaps
a little foundation.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.655
Maybe some blush for ruddiness,

15:23.657 --> 15:25.056
but nothing on my neck,
I assure you.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.758
I don't understand.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.559
Look, all I want to do
is make my father proud

15:28.561 --> 15:30.929
by winning a gold medal
in the X Games.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.797
You might have your work
cut out for you.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.565
It's true.
When it comes to action sports,

15:34.567 --> 15:35.867
I will never measure up to him.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.568
To who? Senior?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.637
He has taught me
everything I know.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.639
He is an X Games expert.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.976
Right. I'm sure he's the one
with the 555 tattoo.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.444
Silly.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.646
Why would Father
have a 555 tattoo?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.214
He already has the triple-S's.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.115
What?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.150
S-S-S.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.117
It stands for...

15:53.119 --> 15:55.453
Señor Senior, Sr.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.821
Yes.
You finished my sentence.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.656
Wade, Kim here.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.925
I went after the wrong
generation of Senior.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.293
Kim, check this.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.761
Vinnie Wheeler
is flying out a shipment

16:03.763 --> 16:05.163
of uncut diamonds today

16:05.165 --> 16:07.098
right over the X Games venue.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.567
The sky surfing expo.
Thanks, Wade.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.793
( <i>yells</i> )

16:37.830 --> 16:38.830
( <i>grunts</i> )

16:39.999 --> 16:41.532
Sorry.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.667
Sorry. Excuse me.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.768
Pardon me.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.836
This'll just take a sec.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.111
Huh?

16:53.979 --> 16:55.046
Senior.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.781
Ah, Kim Possible.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.116
Did you not like the T-shirt?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.851
What about your
new simple life?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.719
What about wanting for nothing?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.721
Have you ever tasted
home-churned butter?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.523
It is quite revolting.

17:08.060 --> 17:12.663
I'm probably going
to regret this, but...

17:23.142 --> 17:25.543
Well, well, well...

17:25.545 --> 17:27.211
Hope you don't mind me
dropping in.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.615
Oh! Talk about unfriendly skies.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.100
( <i>yells</i> )

18:03.682 --> 18:04.415
( <i>gasps</i> )

18:08.587 --> 18:10.721
Have a nice flight.

18:16.728 --> 18:17.995
( <i>yells</i> )

18:26.138 --> 18:27.371
You should really consider

18:27.373 --> 18:30.007
qualifying for the X Games,
Kim Possible.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.043
Your moves are quite fresh.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.277
How do you like this one?

18:34.980 --> 18:38.116
I am only trying to get back
what was taken from me.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.650
Not on my watch.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.923
( <i>gasps</i> )

18:45.925 --> 18:46.557
( <i>yells</i> )

18:50.696 --> 18:52.930
Listen, Billy, buddy, I want you
to increase the reward money

18:52.932 --> 18:54.132
to two billion.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.199
This is personal, baby.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.934
I want this guy caught.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.703
( <i>motor hums</i> )

18:58.705 --> 19:01.105
No date is worth this!

19:01.107 --> 19:03.174
Whoo-hoo!

19:03.176 --> 19:05.343
( <i>screaming</i> )

19:15.120 --> 19:17.922
( <i>screaming</i> )

19:22.261 --> 19:23.928
Hang on, Rufus!

19:23.930 --> 19:25.696
Yee-haw!

19:36.742 --> 19:37.975
( <i>groans</i> )

19:37.977 --> 19:39.310
Oof! ( <i>groans</i> )

19:39.312 --> 19:42.380
A parachute would be nice
right now.

19:44.049 --> 19:46.117
Or this will work.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.030
( <i>groaning</i> )

19:59.032 --> 20:00.865
( <i>crowd booing</i>)

20:00.867 --> 20:02.867
Again!

20:03.835 --> 20:05.903
Hey, how sick was that?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.171
Ugh, not even.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.739
You were totally curved.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.777
Wait.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.078
Don't you want to interview me?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.781
What? For shortest
sports career ever?

20:16.783 --> 20:17.949
Let's go, Mac.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.085
Hey, guys.
Any suggestions?

20:21.087 --> 20:23.221
Yep. Retire, man.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.422
You know,
before you hurt someone.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.123
Starting with yourself, dude.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.008
( <i>gasps</i>)

20:45.210 --> 20:47.144
Step aside, Junior.

20:47.146 --> 20:49.347
I cannot allow you to turn in
my father.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.249
Oh, you can't?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.451
No, because I am going to do it.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.922
But why, Junior, why?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.857
To betray your own father.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.425
Father, please.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.060
I'm turning you in
for the reward.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.196
Reward? You mean cash?

21:05.198 --> 21:06.931
Crisp legal tender?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.132
But of course.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.500
I will use it
to break you out of prison

21:09.502 --> 21:10.768
and buy back our island.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.837
Ah, an excellent plan.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.107
After all, you cannot buy Le Goop
hair care products with moral fiber.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.308
You've done well, Junior.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.243
I am proud of you, my son!

21:20.879 --> 21:23.781
Hey, you want to move tables?
It's kind of hot here.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.016
No! No, umbrellas!

21:25.018 --> 21:26.951
Oh, or not.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.956
I can't believe I got one day
of jock-dom like that.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.025
It's like getting one bite
of a queserito combo

21:34.027 --> 21:36.427
and then having the whole
platter yanked away.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.162
Ron, let me
spell this out for you.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.431
Girls like guys who are
comfortable with who they are.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.966
Embrace your Ron-ness

21:41.968 --> 21:43.968
and just stop trying to be
something you're not.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.337
You know something, Kim,
you might be right.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.139
From now on, no more posing.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.240
No more fronting.

I'm Ron Stoppable.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.209
What you see is what you get.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.245
And I'm not changing for anyone.

21:54.247 --> 21:55.279
There you go.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.447
Excuse me, but...
you're the guy

21:56.449 --> 21:57.948
who stopped that thief, right?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.283
Well, I...

21:59.285 --> 22:01.152
We totally saw it
on the big screen.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.887
It was so bad-ical.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.089
You're, like, a hero.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.392
Remember:
embrace the Ron-ness.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.094
Listen, I don't know if "hero"

22:10.096 --> 22:11.395
would really be the right word

22:11.397 --> 22:13.364
to describe me.
I...

22:13.366 --> 22:16.867
I think "crusading
crime fighter" might be

22:16.869 --> 22:18.102
a more accurate term.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.570
( <i>groans</i>)
