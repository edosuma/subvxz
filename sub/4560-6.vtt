00:04.675 --> 00:08.109
Hey, Dad,
we're home. Dad?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.241
Dad! Dad?

00:10.241 --> 00:13.444
Hey, that's weird.
I thought he said Lori
was coming over.

00:13.444 --> 00:15.716
[Lori giggling] Stop that!

00:15.716 --> 00:18.289
- I'm gonna getcha.
- Don't you dare! I'm ticklish!

00:18.289 --> 00:20.651
- You know that!
- Oh, hey, girls.

00:20.651 --> 00:22.723
[both] Bleeeah!

00:22.723 --> 00:26.057
Oh, come on, now, stop that
"old people are gross" thing.

00:26.057 --> 00:27.458
We were just sittin'
in the hot tub.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.460
- Bleeeah!
- Make it stop!

00:29.460 --> 00:32.433
Watch it, girls,
or I'll call him
my cuddly cowboy!

00:32.433 --> 00:34.465
[both] La la la la la la!

00:34.465 --> 00:36.407
- Nice work.
- I'm gonna go change.

00:36.407 --> 00:40.471
[mimicking elderly person]
I don't wanna be late for steak
night at the senior center.

00:40.471 --> 00:42.343
Ooh, steak night.
While you're up there,

00:42.343 --> 00:44.445
be sure to grab
my meat teeth.

00:44.445 --> 00:48.619
- [laughing] My meat teeth.
- Wow, Dad.

00:48.619 --> 00:51.522
I can't believe
you finally found someone
that'll laugh at your jokes.

00:51.522 --> 00:53.124
And means it!

00:53.124 --> 00:55.186
Love is strange, girls.

00:55.186 --> 00:57.158
So true. But I really
am happy for you.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.060
I know you are, darlin'.
Hey, even though I've been

01:00.060 --> 01:02.363
spending a lot of time
with Lori,
don't think I forgot

01:02.363 --> 01:05.196
about me and you
spending tomorrow
afternoon together.

01:05.196 --> 01:08.439
Oh...

01:08.439 --> 01:09.670
You forgot again,
didn't you?

01:09.670 --> 01:12.543
I did not forget.
I specifically told Lilly
to remind me.

01:12.543 --> 01:16.577
Lillian Truscott, you have
disappointed my father
once again. Shame on you.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.549
Hmm. Not true, not funny,

01:18.549 --> 01:21.382
and not as cute
in those pants
as you think you are.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.853
You see what I have
to deal with, Daddy?

01:22.853 --> 01:26.487
No responsibility.
It's always
somebody else's fault.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.560
Mile, this is the fourth
time you've stood me up.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.393
[sighs] I know.
And I'm sorry.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.265
But me and my friends
were gonna go to the beach

01:34.265 --> 01:36.427
and play volleyball
and then have a bonfire.

01:36.427 --> 01:38.199
All right, then,
I get it.

01:38.199 --> 01:41.502
If you don't want to
spend time with the man who...

01:41.502 --> 01:42.873
...brought you into
this world... [sniffling]

01:42.873 --> 01:45.176
...and clothed you...

01:45.176 --> 01:48.479
...who fed you and gave you
14 number one singles in a row,

01:48.479 --> 01:50.811
then... ready, set, go.

01:52.483 --> 01:53.714
Seriously?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.716
I know. Songwriting, a ten.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.189
Acting, a generous five.

01:58.189 --> 02:00.791
You know, Mile,
what I'm trying to say is,

02:00.791 --> 02:03.424
you're growing so fast,
before we know it,

02:03.424 --> 02:05.456
you're gonna be up
and off to college

02:05.456 --> 02:07.428
and I'm only gonna
see you on holidays

02:07.428 --> 02:09.530
with a dang turkey
sittin' in between us.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.362
Daddy, that's not true.

02:11.362 --> 02:13.464
We can put Jackson
at the end of the table.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.637
I just miss you,
honey, that's all.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.369
OK, you know what?

02:18.369 --> 02:19.640
Forget the beach.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.843
Tomorrow, just you and me,
daddy/daughter day.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.277
- Chiseled in stone?
- Solid as a rock.

02:26.277 --> 02:29.149
And I promise
I won't change the plan.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.753

Anything but this.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.751
Lilly, when you
have kids one day,

03:00.751 --> 03:04.255
may I suggest
a stay-at-home dad
or a nanny?

03:04.255 --> 03:07.758
The whole maternal thing?
Not really in the big bag
of Lilly.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.365
- [gasps] Jesse!
- That doesn't even
make sense.

03:14.365 --> 03:17.197
It does when he's
standing over there.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.800
- Oh, my gosh, it's Jesse!
- No!

03:19.800 --> 03:21.602
Hold on. I'm in
a flashback moment.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.776

out of my head.

yourself in a song...

look like when we kiss?

03:45.956 --> 03:48.699
That is so unattractive.

03:48.699 --> 03:50.631
Well, now that I'm not
with Jake anymore,

03:50.631 --> 03:52.533

messed with my head.

afternoon's conversation now

better to do?

disappointment

08:22.102 --> 08:23.804
and there's no way
any self-respecting dad

08:23.804 --> 08:26.877

special time... with this guy!

08:27.878 --> 08:29.640

by design?

the joy of a father/son
grunion hunt.

08:45.295 --> 08:47.758
By the time I got there,
she was doing the funky chicken

08:47.758 --> 08:48.899
with Freddy Finkelstein.

08:48.899 --> 08:52.032
I swore I'd never feel
that pain again.

So to get out of
daddy/daughter day,

08:54.204 --> 08:56.737
I have to be as gross
and worthless as you?

08:56.737 --> 08:59.239
- But that's impossible.
- Of course it is!

08:59.239 --> 09:02.643
Do you know how hard it is
to get a father to give up
on his child?

09:02.643 --> 09:05.816
It takes years
of hard work!

09:05.816 --> 09:09.079
Which, of course, leaves you
with only one option.

09:09.079 --> 09:12.723
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. The truth.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.625

09:14.625 --> 09:17.688
Face it. You don't have
my talent for anything
but the truth.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.590
Every time you try,
you wind up getting caught

09:19.590 --> 09:21.732
and sitting on a bench
or the couch or the porch,

09:21.732 --> 09:24.835
where Dad says, "Bud,
if you just would've told
the truth in the beginning,

09:24.835 --> 09:27.297
yadda, yadda, yadda. I love
you." "I love you, too."

he writes a song. The end.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.602
That is not true.
Daddy has never uttered
the words,

"Yadda, yadda, yadda"
in his life!

09:33.674 --> 09:35.345
And that's sad. I can't
believe you lost a girl

09:35.345 --> 09:37.608
to Freddy "The Freakshow"
Finkelstein!

09:37.608 --> 09:39.780
He got dance lessons
for his Bar Mitzvah.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.913
He was like a Justin Timberlake
with a yarmulke.

I didn't have a chance!

09:49.890 --> 09:52.993
What's a five-letter word
meaning forgiveness
or compassion?

09:52.993 --> 09:55.595
Well, that's easy.
It's "Daddy."

09:55.595 --> 09:58.098
Because he's always
full of forgiveness
and compassion.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.271
- Mwah!
- Uh, you might wanna
put your feet up,

10:01.271 --> 10:03.173
it's about to get
real deep in here.

10:04.635 --> 10:07.007
[fake laughter]
Not to mention,
he is so funny!

10:07.007 --> 10:09.780
Along with the previously
forgiving and compassionate.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.843
- Wow, you were right.
- So, what is it?

10:12.843 --> 10:16.687
[sighs] Well, Dad,
I respect you too much

10:16.687 --> 10:20.651
to make up some silly excuse,
so I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

10:20.651 --> 10:22.653
You're bailing on me
again, aren't you?

10:22.653 --> 10:24.995
[scoffs] Bailing? No!

10:24.995 --> 10:27.758
We made a plan and I intend
to stick to that plan.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.160
- Just not today.
- Yeah, well...

10:30.160 --> 10:33.233
You know what? Here's a plan
you can stick with.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.365
No plan.
How's that sound to you?

10:35.365 --> 10:36.867
To be honest?
A little angry.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.839
I don't think you want
to sound like that

10:38.839 --> 10:40.010
in front of your pretty
new girlfriend.

10:41.211 --> 10:42.743
You know what?
Now that's enough.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.675
Dad, why are you being
so dramatic about this?

10:44.675 --> 10:46.877
- It's just one silly afternoon.
- Silly afternoon?

10:46.877 --> 10:48.378
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Yeah, you did.

10:48.378 --> 10:51.922
No, Dad, I'm sorry.
Something came up and
it's really important.

10:51.922 --> 10:54.124
Mile, if spending time
with me always
has to come in second

10:54.124 --> 10:57.688
to spending time
with anything else,
then the heck with it.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.790
- Fine!
- Fine.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.932
That's what I get
for telling the truth!

11:01.932 --> 11:03.433
Nice message, Dad!

11:07.738 --> 11:09.069
Wow.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.402

than that time
I sneeze-farted in yoga.

11:29.059 --> 11:32.062
Yeah, there's no people,
no cars, no cell phones.

Smile back.

11:41.031 --> 11:42.402

11:45.906 --> 11:47.838
Thanks,
that's really sweet.

11:47.838 --> 11:50.480
[Robby Ray] Well, isn't this
a pretty picture?

11:50.480 --> 11:51.882
All goo-goo-eyed without even

11:51.882 --> 11:53.944

broken-hearted daddy.

11:53.944 --> 11:56.987
Oh, wait.
You are. Ha ha!

11:58.488 --> 12:00.490
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, of course.

12:00.490 --> 12:01.852
Why wouldn't it be?

12:01.852 --> 12:03.954
[Robby Ray] I can think
of a few good reasons.

12:03.954 --> 12:05.996
[Miley] Get out
of my head, old man!

12:05.996 --> 12:07.457
I'm with you...

12:07.457 --> 12:09.429
[Robby Ray] And not me.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.732
...on this beautiful day,

[Miley] Smile!

12:16.837 --> 12:20.410
OK, then. I brought
bread and cheese...

12:20.410 --> 12:21.772
Yum!

12:21.772 --> 12:23.113
[Robby Ray] "Yum?" You can eat,

Mmmm! Delicious!
Guilt-free bread!

12:34.024 --> 12:36.887
I was gonna cut this up, but
I could just toss it right in.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.929
Sorry.
I just love bread.

12:38.929 --> 12:41.491
- OK.
- [Miley] Smile!

12:42.933 --> 12:44.965
Dad, you're ruining
everything!

12:44.965 --> 12:48.068
Would you just get out
of my head and go away?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.240
Dad? Dad?

12:50.240 --> 12:53.073
Finally, alone at last.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.076
Weren't we alone before?

12:57.247 --> 12:58.879
Yeah, but, um...

aren't looking.

13:09.359 --> 13:12.062
Ah, hoo-ah

13:12.062 --> 13:14.965
- I'm sorry, that's my phone.
- Hoo-ah!

13:14.965 --> 13:17.567
Oh, yeah,

13:17.567 --> 13:20.230
- Hoo-ah!
 - It's my dad. I'm sorry,
I gotta take this.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.933
Wait, right now?
Couldn't you just
let it go to voicemail?

13:22.933 --> 13:24.034
I'm sorry,
I really can't.

13:24.034 --> 13:26.406
Hey, Dad. Hey.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.879
- No, now's a great time.
- Hello!

13:28.879 --> 13:30.841
Losing the hoo-ah

13:30.841 --> 13:32.342
I'm sorry,
it's kind of important.

13:32.342 --> 13:34.384
And I'm not?

13:37.988 --> 13:40.420
Would either of you
do this on a first date?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.421
I don't think so.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.524
That's it.
I'm outta here.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.360
- Hey, where are you going?
- I don't know.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.461
Why don't you ask your dad?

13:51.461 --> 13:53.063
You seem
way more interested

13:53.063 --> 13:54.434
in talking to him
than being with me.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.006
Miley, I don't think
you understand...

13:56.006 --> 13:57.307
And I don't think
you understand.

13:57.307 --> 13:59.209
I blew off a whole
afternoon with my dad

13:59.209 --> 14:01.541
and you can't blow off
one stupid phone call
with yours?!

14:01.541 --> 14:04.414
My dad's stationed
in Afghanistan.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.346
What?

14:06.346 --> 14:09.019
If I get five minutes with him
a couple of times a month,

14:09.019 --> 14:11.321
I'm gonna take it.
I don't care who I'm with.

14:11.321 --> 14:14.024
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.056
You must think I'm the
biggest jerk in the world.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.229
It's OK.
It's not your fault.

14:22.062 --> 14:26.466
I mean, you're probably
used to having your dad
around all the time,

14:26.466 --> 14:29.069
so you think
blowing him off's
not a big thing.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.172
But when you're dealing
with what my family's
dealing with,

14:32.172 --> 14:34.544

Donating money
