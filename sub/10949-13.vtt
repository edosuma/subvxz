You just need to master all four elements

I think it's time I joined your group

You know, how it would've been nice for us

03:45.600 --> 03:47.020
Ouch.

03:49.190 --> 03:51.440
I bet it's because I changed sides.

03:51.610 --> 03:53.110
That's ridiculous.

I don't know.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.530
Maybe it isn't.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.660
Maybe your firebending comes from rage

03:58.740 --> 04:02.080
and you just don't have enough anger
to fuel it the way you used to.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.620
So all we need to do is make Zuko angry.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.000
Easy enough.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.260
There has to be another way.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.800
You're gonna need to learn to draw
your firebending from a different source.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.430
I recommend the original source.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.270
How's he supposed to do that?

04:26.350 --> 04:27.770
By jumping into a volcano?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.350
No.

04:29.440 --> 04:33.320
Zuko needs to go back to whatever
the source of firebending is.

were the dragons and they're extinct.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.090
What do you mean?

05:38.170 --> 05:41.630
Roku had a dragon, and there were
plenty of dragons when I was a kid.

were the ancient Sun Warriors.

from where we are now.

06:04.490 --> 06:07.030
Maybe we can learn
by poking around the ruins.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.000
It's like the monks used to tell me.

06:09.450 --> 06:12.500
Sometimes, the shadows of the past
can be felt by the present.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.210

06:14.290 --> 06:17.170
Maybe you'll pick up some
super old Sun Warrior energy

06:17.250 --> 06:19.460
just by standing where they stood
1,000 years ago?

06:19.550 --> 06:21.010
ZUKO: More or less.

06:21.090 --> 06:25.640

or the Avatar has to find a new teacher.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.260
there's something eerily
familiar about them.

somehow descended from these.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.810

about architecture.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.690

Where's that upbeat attitude
you were talking about?

they've got something worth protecting.

about the original source of firebending.

friends with the Sun Warriors.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.820
ZUKO: Well, they had
a funny way of showing it.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.790
Zuko, something happened
to the dragons in the last 100 years.

08:14.540 --> 08:15.910
Something you're not telling me.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.830
My great-grandfather Sozin happened.

08:19.710 --> 08:22.460
He started the tradition
of hunting dragons for glory.

08:22.550 --> 08:24.260
They were the ultimate firebenders.

08:24.380 --> 08:28.050
And if you could conquer one, your
firebending talents would become legendary

08:28.130 --> 08:30.510
and you'd earn the honorary title, dragon.

08:31.470 --> 08:37.100
The last great dragon was conquered
long before I was born, by my uncle.

08:37.980 --> 08:42.520
But I thought your uncle was,
I don't know, good?

08:42.820 --> 08:44.690

11:46.290 --> 11:47.630
Me?

11:47.710 --> 11:49.080
I can't move either.

11:51.630 --> 11:53.800
( GROANING )

11:54.720 --> 11:56.340
It stopped.

11:56.430 --> 11:58.090
At least we have air.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.060
Maybe if we stay calm,
we can figure a way out of this.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.020
You had to pick up
the glowing egg, didn't you?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.360
At least I made
something happen.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.900
If it were up to you, we'd never
have made it past the courtyard.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.570
Help!

12:18.240 --> 12:20.160
Who are you yelling to?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.830
Nobody's lived here for centuries.

12:21.910 --> 12:24.700
Well, what do <i>you</i> think we should do?

12:25.580 --> 12:27.750
Think about our place in the universe?

12:29.670 --> 12:31.250
( SIGHING )

12:33.500 --> 12:34.670
Who is down there?

12:48.190 --> 12:52.360
For trying to take our sun stone,
you must be severely punished.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.690
We didn't come here
to take your sun stone.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.700
We came here to find the
ancient origin of all firebending.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.910
MAN: yeah, right.

12:59.990 --> 13:03.410
They are obviously thieves,
here to steal Sun Warrior treasures.

13:03.490 --> 13:04.870
AANG: Please.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.790
I don't normally play this card,
but I'm the Avatar.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.050
Just hear us out.

13:15.130 --> 13:19.380
My name is Zuko,
Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.

13:19.470 --> 13:21.050
Or at least, I used to be.

13:21.140 --> 13:23.970
I know my people have distorted
the ways of firebending,

13:24.050 --> 13:26.100
to be fueled
by anger and rage.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.940
But now I want to learn the true way,
the original way.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.810
When we came here, I never imagined

13:31.900 --> 13:35.020
the Sun Warrior civilization
was secretly alive.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.610
I am truly humbled to be in your presence.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.240
Please, teach us.

13:41.410 --> 13:44.240
If you wish to learn the ways of the sun

13:44.330 --> 13:48.040
you must learn them from
the masters Ran and Shao.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.040
Ran and Shao?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.330
There are two of them?

13:51.420 --> 13:55.460
When you present yourselves
to them, they will examine you.

13:55.540 --> 14:00.010
They'll read your hearts,
your souls, and your ancestry.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.470
If they deem you worthy,
they'll teach you.

14:02.550 --> 14:07.350
If they don't, you'll be
destroyed on the spot.

14:17.270 --> 14:19.610
CHIEF: If you're going to see the masters,

14:19.690 --> 14:23.360
you must bring them a piece
of the eternal flame.

14:23.950 --> 14:28.040
This fire is the very first one.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.660
It was given to man by the dragons.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.830
We have kept it going
for thousands of years.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.670
I don't believe it.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.090
CHIEF: You will each take
a piece of it to the masters

14:39.170 --> 14:43.550
to show your commitment to
the sacred art of firebending.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.390
Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir?

14:46.470 --> 14:49.140
Yeah, I'm not a firebender yet.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.770
Couldn't my friend here
carry my fire for me?

14:51.850 --> 14:52.980
No.

14:57.690 --> 15:03.150
This ritual illustrates
the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.950
You must maintain a constant heat.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.540
The flame will go out
if you make it too small.

15:09.620 --> 15:12.960
Make it too big,
and you might lose control.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.580
I'm sorry.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.710
I'm just a little nervous.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.670
It's like a little heartbeat.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.930
Fire is life, not just destruction.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.810
You will take your flames up there.

15:30.890 --> 15:34.440
The cave of the masters
is beneath that rock.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.240
Hurry up.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.450
I can't.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.240
If I walk too fast, my flame'll go out.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.700
Your flame's gonna go out
because it's too small.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.160
You're too timid.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.370
Give it more juice.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.160
But what if I can't control it?

15:55.250 --> 15:56.330
You can do it.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.420
I know you can.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.000
You're a talented kid.

16:12.560 --> 16:18.770
Facing the judgment of the firebending
masters will be very dangerous for you.

16:18.850 --> 16:23.820
Your ancestors are directly responsible
for the dragons' disappearance.

16:24.490 --> 16:28.030
The masters might not be
so happy to see you.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.070
I know I wouldn't be.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.120
But once they find out I'm the Avatar...

16:32.280 --> 16:34.620
Have you forgotten that you vanished

16:34.700 --> 16:37.750
allowing the Fire Nation
to wreak havoc on the world?

16:37.830 --> 16:41.380
The decline of the dragons
is your burden too.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.600
We could turn back now.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.270
We've already learned more
about fire than we'd hoped.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.690
No, we're seeing through to the end.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.190
We're gonna meet these masters
and find out what's so great about them.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.030
What if they judge us and attack us?

17:08.110 --> 17:10.110
Well, we're the fire prince
and the Avatar.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.950
I think we could take these guys in
a fight, whoever they are.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.920
Bring 'em out.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.750
Chanters!

17:24.290 --> 17:28.550
( MEN VOCALIZING RHYTHMICALLY )

18:08.210 --> 18:13.930
MAN: Those who wish to meet the masters
Ran and Shao will now present their fire.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.770
CHIEF: Sound the call.

18:22.140 --> 18:24.480
( HORN BLOWING )

18:25.310 --> 18:27.020
( CRASHING )

18:28.780 --> 18:29.900
What's happening?

18:34.450 --> 18:35.570
( GASPING )

18:35.660 --> 18:37.030
Zuko, my fire went out.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.240
What do you want me to do?

18:38.330 --> 18:39.330
Give me some of yours.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.700
( GRUNTING )

18:40.790 --> 18:42.410
- No, just make your own.
- I can't.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
( GRUNTING )

18:43.580 --> 18:45.460
ZUKO: Get some from one of those warriors.
Hurry.

18:45.630 --> 18:47.090
Stop cheating off me.

18:47.340 --> 18:48.630
AANG: Quit being stingy.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.800
( BOTH GRUNTING )

18:56.180 --> 18:57.470
( CRASHING )

18:58.850 --> 19:00.060
BOTH: Uh-oh.

19:01.810 --> 19:02.930
( DRAGON GROWLING )

19:15.240 --> 19:16.660
These are the masters.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.700
You still think we can take 'em?

19:18.780 --> 19:19.910
Shh.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.160
I never said that.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.460
Oh, here it comes.

19:29.540 --> 19:30.750
Any moment now.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.260
Dinner for the masters.

19:32.340 --> 19:33.340
Quiet, Ham Ghao.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.630
What?

19:34.720 --> 19:36.050
Everyone's thinking it.

19:44.390 --> 19:48.230
Zuko, I think we're supposed to
do the dragon dance with them.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.730
What?

19:49.820 --> 19:52.610
What about this situation makes you think
they want us to dance?

19:52.690 --> 19:55.490
Well, I think they want us
to do something.

19:56.150 --> 19:58.030
Let's just try it.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.160
Fine.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.980
Judgment time.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.350
( DRAGON GROWLING )

20:31.310 --> 20:32.520
( WHIMPERING )

20:36.190 --> 20:37.820
( AANG AND ZUKO SCREAMING )

20:48.960 --> 20:50.170
( GASPING )

20:52.130 --> 20:53.590
I understand.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.820
Their fire was beautiful.

21:16.990 --> 21:20.450
I saw so many colors,
colors I've never imagined.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.280
AANG: Like firebending harmony.

21:22.370 --> 21:23.700
Yes.

21:24.410 --> 21:29.500
They judged you, and gave you visions of
the meaning of firebending.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.380
I can't believe there are
still living dragons

21:32.460 --> 21:35.550
My uncle Iroh said he faced
the last dragon and killed it.

21:35.630 --> 21:37.380
So your uncle lied.

21:37.460 --> 21:40.720
Actually, it wasn't a total lie.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.180
Iroh was the last outsider
to face the masters.

21:44.260 --> 21:49.480
They deemed him worthy
and passed the secret on to him as well.

21:50.270 --> 21:53.940
ZUKO: He must've lied to protect them,
so no one else would hunt them.

21:54.690 --> 21:58.610
All this time, I thought
firebending was destruction.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.700
Since I hurt Katara,
I've been too afraid and hesitant

22:02.910 --> 22:05.080
But now I know what it really is.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.450
It's energy, and life.

22:07.830 --> 22:08.910
Yeah.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.290
It's like the sun, but inside of you.

22:11.370 --> 22:12.960
Do you guys realize this?

22:13.040 --> 22:19.090
Well, our civilization is called
the Sun Warriors, so yeah.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.840
That's why my firebending
was so weak before,

22:21.930 --> 22:25.510
because for so many years,
hunting you was my drive.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.470
It was my purpose.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.180
So when I joined you,
I lost sight of my inner fire.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.350
But now, I have a new drive.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.400
I have to help you defeat my father
and restore balance to the world.

22:49.450 --> 22:55.040
Now that you have learned the secrets
and you know about our tribe's existence,

22:55.920 --> 23:00.710
we have no choice but to
imprison you here forever.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.550
Just kidding.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.890
But seriously, don't tell anyone.

23:10.020 --> 23:15.020
AANG: With this technique the dragons
showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.860
( APPLAUSE )

23:19.940 --> 23:22.030
SOKKA: Yeah, that's a great
dance you two learned there.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.530
It's not a dance.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.910
It's a firebending form.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.370
We'll just tap dance our way
to victory over the Fire Lord.

23:28.450 --> 23:31.790
It's a sacred form that happens to be
thousands of years old.

23:32.290 --> 23:33.460
Oh, yeah?

23:33.540 --> 23:35.120
What's your little form called?

23:36.120 --> 23:37.880
The Dancing Dragon.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.710
( LAUGHTER )
