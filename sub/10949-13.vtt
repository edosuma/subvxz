Zuko, do something.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.630

11:47.710 --> 11:49.080

11:54.720 --> 11:56.340

11:56.430 --> 11:58.090
At least we have air.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.060
Maybe if we stay calm,
we can figure a way out of this.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.020
You had to pick up
the glowing egg, didn't you?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.360
At least I made
something happen.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.900
If it were up to you, we'd never
have made it past the courtyard.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.570
Help!

12:18.240 --> 12:20.160
Who are you yelling to?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.830
Nobody's lived here for centuries.

12:21.910 --> 12:24.700
Well, what do <i>you</i> think we should do?

12:25.580 --> 12:27.750
Think about our place in the universe?

12:29.670 --> 12:31.250
( SIGHING )

12:33.500 --> 12:34.670
Who is down there?

12:48.190 --> 12:52.360
For trying to take our sun stone,
you must be severely punished.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.690
We didn't come here
to take your sun stone.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.700
We came here to find the
ancient origin of all firebending.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.910
MAN: yeah, right.

12:59.990 --> 13:03.410
They are obviously thieves,
here to steal Sun Warrior treasures.

13:03.490 --> 13:04.870
AANG: Please.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.790
I don't normally play this card,
but I'm the Avatar.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.050
Just hear us out.

13:15.130 --> 13:19.380
My name is Zuko,
Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.

13:19.470 --> 13:21.050
Or at least, I used to be.

13:21.140 --> 13:23.970
I know my people have distorted
the ways of firebending,

13:24.050 --> 13:26.100
to be fueled
by anger and rage.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.940
But now I want to learn the true way,
the original way.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.810
When we came here, I never imagined

13:31.900 --> 13:35.020
the Sun Warrior civilization
was secretly alive.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.610
I am truly humbled to be in your presence.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.240
Please, teach us.

13:41.410 --> 13:44.240
If you wish to learn the ways of the sun

13:44.330 --> 13:48.040
you must learn them from
the masters Ran and Shao.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.040
Ran and Shao?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.330
There are two of them?

13:51.420 --> 13:55.460
When you present yourselves
to them, they will examine you.

13:55.540 --> 14:00.010
They'll read your hearts,
your souls, and your ancestry.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.470
If they deem you worthy,
they'll teach you.

14:02.550 --> 14:07.350
If they don't, you'll be
destroyed on the spot.

14:17.270 --> 14:19.610
CHIEF: If you're going to see the masters,

14:19.690 --> 14:23.360
you must bring them a piece
of the eternal flame.

14:23.950 --> 14:28.040
This fire is the very first one.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.660
It was given to man by the dragons.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.830
We have kept it going
for thousands of years.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.670
I don't believe it.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.090
CHIEF: You will each take
a piece of it to the masters

14:39.170 --> 14:43.550
to show your commitment to
the sacred art of firebending.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.390
Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir?

14:46.470 --> 14:49.140
Yeah, I'm not a firebender yet.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.770
Couldn't my friend here
carry my fire for me?

14:51.850 --> 14:52.980
No.

14:57.690 --> 15:03.150
This ritual illustrates
the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.950
You must maintain a constant heat.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.540
The flame will go out
if you make it too small.

15:09.620 --> 15:12.960
Make it too big,
and you might lose control.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.580
I'm sorry.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.710
I'm just a little nervous.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.670
It's like a little heartbeat.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.930
Fire is life, not just destruction.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.810
You will take your flames up there.

15:30.890 --> 15:34.440
The cave of the masters
is beneath that rock.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.240
Hurry up.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.450
I can't.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.240
If I walk too fast, my flame'll go out.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.700
Your flame's gonna go out
because it's too small.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.160
You're too timid.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.370
Give it more juice.

15:53.450 --> 15:55.160
But what if I can't control it?

15:55.250 --> 15:56.330
You can do it.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.420
I know you can.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.000
You're a talented kid.

16:12.560 --> 16:18.770
Facing the judgment of the firebending
masters will be very dangerous for you.

16:18.850 --> 16:23.820
Your ancestors are directly responsible
for the dragons' disappearance.

16:24.490 --> 16:28.030
The masters might not be
so happy to see you.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.070
I know I wouldn't be.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.120
But once they find out I'm the Avatar...

16:32.280 --> 16:34.620
Have you forgotten that you vanished

16:34.700 --> 16:37.750
allowing the Fire Nation
to wreak havoc on the world?

16:37.830 --> 16:41.380
The decline of the dragons
is your burden too.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.600
We could turn back now.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.270
We've already learned more
about fire than we'd hoped.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.690
No, we're seeing through to the end.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.190
We're gonna meet these masters
and find out what's so great about them.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.030
What if they judge us and attack us?

17:08.110 --> 17:10.110
Well, we're the fire prince
and the Avatar.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.950
I think we could take these guys in
a fight, whoever they are.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.920

do the dragon dance with them.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.730
What?

19:49.820 --> 19:52.610
What about this situation makes you think
they want us to dance?

19:52.690 --> 19:55.490
Well, I think they want us
to do something.

19:56.150 --> 19:58.030
Let's just try it.

21:16.990 --> 21:20.450
I saw so many colors,

AANG: Like firebending harmony.

21:22.370 --> 21:23.700
Yes.

21:24.410 --> 21:29.500
They judged you, and gave you visions of
the meaning of firebending.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.380
I can't believe there are
still living dragons

21:32.460 --> 21:35.550
My uncle Iroh said he faced
the last dragon and killed it.

21:35.630 --> 21:37.380
So your uncle lied.

21:37.460 --> 21:40.720
Actually, it wasn't a total lie.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.180
Iroh was the last outsider
to face the masters.

21:44.260 --> 21:49.480
They deemed him worthy
and passed the secret on to him as well.

21:50.270 --> 21:53.940
ZUKO: He must've lied to protect them,
so no one else would hunt them.

21:54.690 --> 21:58.610
All this time, I thought
firebending was destruction.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.700
Since I hurt Katara,
I've been too afraid and hesitant

22:02.910 --> 22:05.080
But now I know what it really is.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.450
It's energy, and life.

22:07.830 --> 22:08.910
Yeah.

It's like the sun, but inside of you.

22:13.040 --> 22:19.090
Well, our civilization is called
the Sun Warriors, so yeah.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.840
That's why my firebending
was so weak before,

22:21.930 --> 22:25.510
because for so many years,
hunting you was my drive.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.470
It was my purpose.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.180
So when I joined you,
I lost sight of my inner fire.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.350
But now, I have a new drive.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.400
I have to help you defeat my father
and restore balance to the world.

Now that you have learned the secrets
and you know about our tribe's existence,

we have no choice but to
imprison you here forever.
