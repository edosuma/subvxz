WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.180
BESS:
So, Tiffany Hudson

00:06.223 --> 00:09.487
was being haunted
by Dead Lucy. Uh...

00:09.531 --> 00:11.228
Why? I don't know.

00:11.272 --> 00:15.015
I think that that's why Tiffany
went to Lucy's mom about it?

00:15.058 --> 00:19.019
Why not show Lucy's mom
the video with Lucy on it?

00:19.062 --> 00:21.282
I think that there's
a possibility that Tiffany tried

00:21.325 --> 00:23.066
to show Lucy's mom the video,

00:23.110 --> 00:26.939
but chances are,
Patrice probably unraveled

00:26.983 --> 00:29.725
like she did when I tried
to talk to her about Lucy.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.423
Hannah Gruen thinks
Tiffany got too close

00:32.467 --> 00:34.686
to finding out
the truth about Lucy.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.037
I'm just...
I-I have all the pieces.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.690
I just don't know
how they fit together.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.431
I really need to figure out

00:40.475 --> 00:43.434
who actually killed Lucy before
my dad's evidentiary hearing

00:43.478 --> 00:44.435
in two days.

00:44.479 --> 00:45.741
[both scream]

00:45.784 --> 00:47.308
Patrice! Come on, girls.

00:47.351 --> 00:50.093
Break's over.
[whimpers]

00:50.137 --> 00:52.182
[whispers]:
What?

00:55.490 --> 00:57.927
Chop-chop, girls.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.497
Did you...?
No.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.153
♪ ♪

01:17.164 --> 01:19.122
♪ ♪

01:21.211 --> 01:23.126
Lucy's mom says she worked here.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.302
She let herself in
with the spare key.

01:25.346 --> 01:28.566
I guess we haven't changed that
hiding spot since the '90s.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.177
Where's Nancy?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.483
She's Beautiful Mind'ing
it in George's office.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.659
Says she needs to see the case.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.358
But she told me that when
Patrice had her episode

01:37.401 --> 01:40.622
in Larkspur Lane,
it wasn't like this.

01:40.665 --> 01:44.278
It was a lot scarier.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.845
ACE: Is she dangerous?
BESS: I don't know.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.412
I don't think so.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.154
NICK:
Yeah.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.895
Yeah. Okay,
don't worry. Yep.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.115
She's-she's here.

01:55.158 --> 01:58.161
All right.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.511
So, Josh was taking his mom
to check out a new facility

02:00.555 --> 02:02.687
since Larkspur burned down.

02:02.731 --> 02:06.300
They stopped for gas, and she
jumped in the driver's seat

02:06.343 --> 02:08.302
when he went in to pay.

02:08.345 --> 02:11.218
So now Josh is stranded at
a gas station outside of town.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.133
Oh, my...

02:13.176 --> 02:17.137
If I go pick him up, can you
guys, uh, keep an eye on her?

02:17.180 --> 02:18.355
Are you kidding me?

02:18.399 --> 02:21.053
I can't take my eyes off her.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.405
Party of one. Ha!

02:24.448 --> 02:26.276
[laughs]
Laura? You...

02:26.320 --> 02:27.712
Oh, my goodness.
You look amazing.

02:27.756 --> 02:30.759
I am amazing. Blessings, Bess.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.195
Hi.
Hi...

02:32.239 --> 02:33.544
Mmm.
Ooh.

02:33.588 --> 02:37.244
You, um, you seem different.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.464
After our near-death experience,
I realized I was carrying around

02:40.508 --> 02:43.250
so much anger and negativity
in my life.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.555
Life's too short.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.731
I want to open myself
to the beautiful

02:46.775 --> 02:50.126
and positive possibilities
all around us.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.346
Uh, Laura?

02:52.389 --> 02:54.130
I, uh,

02:54.174 --> 02:57.046
I promised Tiffany
I would keep you safe.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.875
And I-I...

02:59.918 --> 03:01.877
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.314
If I had known the Hudsons
were gonna try to kill you...

03:04.358 --> 03:05.881
Your guilt is a heavy energy.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.491
I don't want it
weighing me down.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.190
Close your eyes and take a deep,

03:10.233 --> 03:12.496
cleansing breath with me.
[inhales]

03:12.540 --> 03:14.324
[exhales]:
Ah...

03:14.368 --> 03:15.934
ACE: Mm.
BESS: Hmm.

03:15.978 --> 03:20.025
You know, um, we-we got this,
if you want to go get Josh.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.550
Okay. Cool. Uh... Great.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.728
So, what brings you
back to town?

03:26.771 --> 03:31.254
Uh, my sister.
I am closing the loop today.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.300
Been cleared as a suspect...

03:33.343 --> 03:34.997
Thank you.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.826
And Tiffany's death has
been ruled a murder,

03:37.869 --> 03:39.958
due to a rare poison.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.395
White baneberry.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.135
Moral of the story
is that Ryan Hudson

03:43.179 --> 03:47.531
and his fa... family,

03:47.575 --> 03:49.446
they don't get a dime.
BESS: Oh.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.493
So you're here to collect
the entire inheritance?

03:52.536 --> 03:55.278
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
And then tomorrow, I go to Paris.
ACE: Oh.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.802
I bought two tickets.
First class.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.630
Come with me.

03:59.674 --> 04:03.068
To-to visit, or...? No.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.506
Come with me. Move with me.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.551
There's nothing keeping
you in this town.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.249
[whispers]:
You were made for Paris.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.773
An expat, soulful thinker.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.601
Come on. You actually
speak French.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.256
Oui.

04:16.299 --> 04:19.215
But what about finding out
what happened to Tiffany?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.869
The Hudsons are murderers.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.784
The state police have taken
over the investigation.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.394
I trust that they'll prove it.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.396
This is it, Ace.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.269
I'm not coming back.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.009
You lost me once.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.229
Do you really want
to lose me again?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.100
No. Of course n...

04:35.144 --> 04:36.493
I...
[chuckles]

04:36.537 --> 04:37.973
Patrice.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.846
So, what did I miss?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.195
Tell me everything.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.811
It's been tough.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.727
You know,
since Larkspur burnt down.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.469
I can't manage
my mom's care alone.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.688
I think I found a new place,
the Golden Pavilion,

04:57.732 --> 04:59.560
over in Mapleton.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.039
I wanted to check it out today,

05:01.083 --> 05:03.085
you know,
make sure it's a good fit.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.391
This must be hard.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.609
Yeah.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.045
Even with full-time care,

05:07.089 --> 05:09.439
I still need
to be there regularly.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.183
I'm gonna have to
close up the shop.

05:19.014 --> 05:23.453
Then it's probably time for me
to find a new place to live.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.108
Listen, I'm sorry, Nick.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.066
Though, I'm pretty sure
you shouldn't have been sleeping

05:28.110 --> 05:29.459
in a working garage.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.113
Hey, the price was right, okay?

05:31.156 --> 05:33.376
And I never slept
so good in my life.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.160
[chuckles] Well, I'm certain
those were the fumes.

05:35.204 --> 05:38.599
[laughs]
Yeah, probably.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.608
Yep.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.174
Ow!

05:49.218 --> 05:51.089
I'll fix that.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.744
Okay, so this is the overlap
between the Tiffany murder

05:53.788 --> 05:55.746
and...

05:55.790 --> 05:57.705
[whispers]: the Lucy murder.
GEORGE: Okay.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.010
You know this is a restaurant,
and you're turning it

05:59.054 --> 06:00.621
into murder town. My dad's hearing

06:00.664 --> 06:02.318
is in two days,
and I need to find something

06:02.362 --> 06:04.364
that proves that he had nothing
to do with Lucy's...

06:05.843 --> 06:08.629
...untimely thing.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.500
Hey, Patrice? Um, would you mind

06:10.544 --> 06:12.154
going and filling up some
ketchup bottles in the back?

06:12.197 --> 06:13.416
Glad to.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.811
Okay.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.943
So, we know that
the Hudsons had something to do

06:18.987 --> 06:19.944
with Lucy's murder.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.642
Right. After
Lucy was killed,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.253
the Hudson shell company paid
Patrice to leave Horseshoe Bay.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.778
And we got that info thanks
to Tiffany's USB drive.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.301
She was collecting dirt
on the Hudsons.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.042
Exactly.
But now we know

06:31.086 --> 06:32.914
that Tiffany wasn't just looking
into Ryan's family.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.743
She was looking into
Lucy Sable's murder as well.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.484
My sister did love
a good puzzle. That's what I was thinking.

06:37.527 --> 06:41.096
Maybe she found some piece
of evidence or something...
[whispering]

06:41.139 --> 06:43.838
...Sable once was able
to gaze upon...

06:43.881 --> 06:46.884
[muttering]:
Lucy Sable once...

06:46.928 --> 06:48.320
Patrice?

06:48.364 --> 06:50.235
Someone got her in the water,

06:50.279 --> 06:52.629
and that's where
she'll always be.

06:54.022 --> 06:56.677
[loud bang]
[all gasping]

07:00.376 --> 07:02.944
[gasping]

07:02.987 --> 07:06.904
Did-did Lucy do that?

07:06.948 --> 07:08.340
[door opens, entry bell jingles]

07:08.384 --> 07:11.256
Mom?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.649
[gasps]

07:12.693 --> 07:13.868
Joshua.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.653
Josh, we were just...

07:16.697 --> 07:18.263
We should go.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.962
Hey, uh, I'm-I'm sorry, Josh.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.879
[bell jingles]

07:26.184 --> 07:29.100
Hey. What the hell
just happened?

07:29.144 --> 07:31.842
Okay. Lucy is trying
to tell us something.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.453
All of this happened
as soon as I said

07:33.496 --> 07:35.237
that Lucy's death led
to Tiffany's death,

07:35.280 --> 07:36.499
which means
I'm on the right track.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.588
Ace, Laura, let's go. Wait, hey.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, but what-what... No, thank you.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.983
Wh-Why not me?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.593
I need to retrace Tiffany's
last steps before she died.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.334
And in order to do that,
I need a hacker

07:45.377 --> 07:47.858
and somebody that knows Tiffany
better than anybody else.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.294
No, no, no, no. This is
not part of my plan.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.297
I am loop-closing,
not loop-opening.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.604
And you don't have
to stay here, Ace.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.302
Think about Paris.
It'll be so romantic.

07:57.346 --> 08:00.567
Hey. You know what
is so romantic?

08:00.610 --> 08:02.830
Solving a homicide together.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.397
With me.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.052
Fine.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.054
I will help you.
Today only.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.274
Tomorrow, Paris-bound,
hand in hand with vous, right?

08:12.317 --> 08:14.102
Mm.Whoo-hoo.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.278
Yeah? Gonna be so fun.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.671
All right.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.324
Okay, wait.
Just...

08:19.368 --> 08:21.936
Just be careful, okay?

08:21.979 --> 08:24.025
Whatever Tiffany discovered
got her murdered,

08:24.068 --> 08:26.027
and it could get
you killed, too.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.028
So just...

08:27.071 --> 08:28.769
be careful.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.206
I'm gonna be fine.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.512
Okay.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.492
Where's Chief McGinnis?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
LAURA:
Yes.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.103
I need to tell him
that I forgive him

08:59.147 --> 09:00.452
for being incompetent.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.542
I'll let him know.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.021
He's in a deposition all day.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.370
Court prep for...

09:05.414 --> 09:07.808
Carson Drew's
evidentiary hearing.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.461
Can I help you
with something or...?

09:09.505 --> 09:10.941
I think you've
helped enough, Karen.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.378
If this is about your father,

09:13.422 --> 09:15.685
you put together that evidence.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.600
I was simply doing my job.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.993
Oh, your job?

09:19.036 --> 09:20.777
You mean invading my privacy
and stealing my journal?

09:20.821 --> 09:24.128
And now my dad's gonna go to
jail for something he didn't do.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.782
Because I think I'm
doing your job, Karen.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.002
I'm trying to find out
who actually killed Lucy,

09:28.045 --> 09:31.005
instead of... Uh, nice... That's
a great segue, Nancy.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.702
That's kind of
actually why we're here.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.399
LAURA:
I want to know where my sister went

09:34.443 --> 09:35.966
on the day she was murdered.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.186
State police have the case.
We're iced out.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.535
But you have access

09:39.579 --> 09:42.016
to Tiffany Hudson's
phone GPS information, right?

09:42.059 --> 09:44.845
It's her last remaining family
member personally requesting it.

09:44.888 --> 09:48.718
And what does this have
to do with Lucy's murder?

09:48.762 --> 09:50.677
You always said Lucy's case
file didn't have the answers

09:50.720 --> 09:52.679
to what happened, so
we're trying a new angle.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.031
Right this way.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.993
ACE: This is the GPS
from Tiffany's cell phone,

10:03.037 --> 10:04.429
tagged with locations?

10:04.473 --> 10:06.083
Two weeks of data
tracking her movements.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.171
Until her death.

Tone Up Health Spa.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.659
Is any of this
jumping out to you?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.356
How long was she
at the Yacht Club?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.794
1:15 until 4:07
on August 14.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.273
Three hours?

10:22.317 --> 10:23.753
Tiffany wouldn't have spent
more than three minutes

10:23.797 --> 10:25.712
at the Yacht Club unless
she had a gun to her head.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.452
Wait, that's Gallows Lane.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.806
There's an address on here.
725 Gallows Lane.

10:32.849 --> 10:36.113
Tiffany went... to see
a medium on Gallows Lane.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.073
That's...

10:39.116 --> 10:42.685
less than a ten-minute walk
from the Yacht Club.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.992
Tiffany was looking
into Hudson family secrets.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.950
She was asking questions
about Lucy's death.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.213
She was paranoid that
the Hudsons were tracking her.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.346
It's not paranoia if they
were actually following her.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.913
A week before she died,

10:52.956 --> 10:55.089
she told me she felt like
she was being watched.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.700
She was hiding her movements.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.267
She drives...

10:59.310 --> 11:01.530
to places where
the hill-toppers frequent.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.532
She leaves her cell phone
in her car and walks

11:03.575 --> 11:05.142

really wants to go. Yeah,

11:05.186 --> 11:06.883

right by my house,

11:06.927 --> 11:10.060

to check out my mom's car.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.106
The health spa is right
near Larkspur Lane.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.847
KAREN:
Yeah, and the day before she died,

11:13.890 --> 11:16.458

20:20.001 --> 20:21.959

20:22.003 --> 20:24.223
You said that you thought
we should come together

20:24.266 --> 20:27.574
to heal and forgive,
that you didn't... Didn't want the burden

20:27.617 --> 20:31.055
of Tiffany's estate to cloud
my new life of simplicity?

20:31.099 --> 20:33.057
Yeah, no, that was a lie.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.798
NANCY:
We think, with your help,

20:34.842 --> 20:36.887
we can figure out
who poisoned Tiffany.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.324
How?

20:38.367 --> 20:40.543
Well, most of the people
in this room were here

20:40.587 --> 20:42.284
the night Tiffany was murdered.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.156
The idea is, we walk through
everything that happened,

20:45.200 --> 20:47.594
from the point
of you walking through the door

20:47.637 --> 20:49.073
until Tiffany died.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.466
See if we missed anything.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.686
That's a good idea. Thank you.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.035
Except we already gave
a statement.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.602
Well, giving a statement
is one thing,

20:55.645 --> 20:57.299
but seeing what everybody
actually was doing

20:57.343 --> 20:59.693
is a whole other thing entirely.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.651
We think that the whole picture

21:01.695 --> 21:04.001
will give us more
than the sum of its parts.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.612
Are you in?

21:05.655 --> 21:07.570
Of course.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.572
I want to find out
who killed Tiffany

21:09.616 --> 21:13.010

Ooh!

21:19.539 --> 21:21.323
I have an idea.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.718
So, since Nick, Laura
and Detective Hart

21:24.761 --> 21:26.720
weren't here
the night Tiffany died,

21:26.763 --> 21:28.504

for Ryan's friends.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.724
Bess, sit down, we're not
doing a reenactment.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.769
Um, Nancy said "walk-through,"

21:32.813 --> 21:35.337

21:36.686 --> 21:37.731

Mr. Hudson, welcome
to The Claw.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.344

the fork thing.

22:32.786 --> 22:33.917

But...

22:36.746 --> 22:38.879
All right...

22:38.922 --> 22:41.272
so, they sat,

22:41.316 --> 22:42.317
and Ryan ordered for Tiffany.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.318

22:59.290 --> 23:01.292
I was overwhelmed.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.208
Tiffany was outside,
and I was ashamed.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.036
And kind of freaking out,

23:06.080 --> 23:07.908

to take a minute

23:07.951 --> 23:10.389

to pick this place

23:12.826 --> 23:14.001
and bring her here.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.219
Why did you pick
this place, Ryan?

23:15.263 --> 23:17.831
I picked this place because...

23:17.874 --> 23:20.268
I was trying to pull off

23:20.311 --> 23:22.052

knew that my father

23:22.096 --> 23:24.359
wouldn't be pleased with.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.535
And this seat right here

23:26.579 --> 23:28.755
was here... and it was empty.
