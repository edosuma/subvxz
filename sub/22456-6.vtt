WEBVTT

00:02.205 --> 00:06.915
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.965 --> 00:09.957
<i>...And I'm so hot</i>

00:10.005 --> 00:14.520
<i>Cos I'm in he-ell...</i>

00:19.284 --> 00:22.560
So I think I'm definitely
going to propose to Sophie.

00:22.604 --> 00:25.641
Propose?! To Sophie?!

00:25.684 --> 00:27.356
Oh, my God, this is massive!

00:27.404 --> 00:28.961
'How does it affect me?

00:29.003 --> 00:32.837
'Shit, I can't manage on my own.
He knows what lottery numbers we do.

00:32.883 --> 00:35.795
'I'll have to do lucky dips.
I'm never going to win.'

00:35.843 --> 00:40.439
I mean, but why? I didn't think
things were going all that well?

00:40.483 --> 00:44.362
Exactly. She's in Bristol,
we hardly ever see each other,

00:44.403 --> 00:46.074
and when we do, we argue.

00:46.122 --> 00:47.714
She's slipping through my fingers.

00:47.762 --> 00:50.993
So therefore you must get married?

00:51.042 --> 00:53.476
I need to make a statement.

00:53.522 --> 00:55.433
You aiming for the bull's-eye?

00:55.482 --> 00:57.473
Course I am.
It's the best thing on the board.

00:57.522 --> 00:59.353
- No, it isn't!
- Look at it.

00:59.402 --> 01:02.154
It's tiny, it's red,
it's right in the bloody middle.

01:02.201 --> 01:04.953
Course it's the best thing
on the board.

01:05.001 --> 01:07.799
I'm going to take her to a four-star
hotel in Somerset,

01:07.841 --> 01:09.832
the Quantocks,
and ask her to marry me.

01:09.881 --> 01:13.351
- Now's the time, I must strike soon.
- Why?

01:13.401 --> 01:16.438
Not because the hotel mega-deal
vouchers from the Sunday Times

01:16.481 --> 01:18.550
expire at the end of the month.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.593
Another mega-deal will come along in
some national newspaper eventually.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.030
Mr Patel saves me the vouchers.
I've got enough for

01:26.080 --> 01:27.991
two rooms, so if it
all goes pear-shaped...

01:28.040 --> 01:29.996
- You've got enough for two rooms?
- No!

01:30.040 --> 01:32.838
Come on, Mark, I could take Big Suze,
break the logjam.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.030
- Weekend in the Boondocks.
- Quantocks. No, Jez, no.

01:36.079 --> 01:38.274
I'm going to propose.

01:38.319 --> 01:40.958
Really, this has to be
a solo mission.

01:40.999 --> 01:43.832
Mark, think about it.
What if she says no?

01:43.879 --> 01:47.235
You'll be trapped in an emotional
shit storm, you'll need back-up.

01:47.279 --> 01:49.793
Look, I suppose if you want,
you can ask her.

01:49.839 --> 01:52.193
Cool. If she can't make it,
I'll take Super Hans.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.830
No, Jeremy, no way!

01:53.878 --> 01:57.507
I'm kidding. Bloody hell, Mark.
Give me some credit!

01:59.478 --> 02:01.594
Weekend in the Quantocks?

02:01.638 --> 02:04.277
Yeah. We'll have to
steer clear of Mark.

02:04.318 --> 02:07.071
The abdominiser?
Don't worry about him.

02:07.118 --> 02:08.470
Different time scheme.

02:08.517 --> 02:11.748
We'll be hitting the sack while he's
getting his morning horn off the FT.

02:11.797 --> 02:14.072
It's a good chance
to get away and do the demo.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.550
Exactly.

02:15.597 --> 02:18.907
There you go, chief.
Have a suck on that sauce bottle.

02:18.957 --> 02:20.515
Living it large on the minibar.

02:21.317 --> 02:24.115
While Big Suze is playing the bloody
Peter's Friends drinking game

02:24.157 --> 02:26.909
with Hugo and Otto and
Rozzle and Nozzle.

02:26.956 --> 02:28.947
Too right.

02:28.996 --> 02:30.065
You not having one?

02:30.116 --> 02:32.789
Nah, not for me. I'm cleaning up.

02:32.836 --> 02:35.987
Kicking everything,
from the PCP to the lattes.

02:36.036 --> 02:38.186
Going straight edge.
Doctor's orders.

02:38.236 --> 02:40.192
You're kicking... everything?

02:40.236 --> 02:41.749
But you don't mind me?

02:41.796 --> 02:43.865
No, mate, no, you have your fun.

02:43.915 --> 02:46.713
Cold beer and a nice fucking
smoke, don't let me stop ya.

02:46.755 --> 02:47.983
Right. OK.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.071
'I give him about five minutes.'

02:50.115 --> 02:53.505
You'll stay strong for me,
though, yeah?

02:53.555 --> 02:56.627
Promise me, whatever happens,
no drugs, yeah?

02:56.675 --> 02:59.108
No, sure, mate. I'm on it.

02:59.154 --> 03:00.826
Right, let's crack on.

03:00.874 --> 03:04.389
Don't say crack, Jez,
please, not now.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.393
Cos you saying crack makes me
think about crack, and I love crack.

03:08.434 --> 03:11.107
So can you not say crack?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.910
Can't believe the restaurant
had no record of my booking.

03:16.953 --> 03:19.308
Let's just choose
somewhere now, I'm tired.

03:19.353 --> 03:22.186
Maybe we should have gone to
the place with the hanging plants.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.712
I thought you didn't want to.

03:23.753 --> 03:26.551
I thought you didn't like it
because when we looked at the menu,

03:26.593 --> 03:28.106
you wrinkled your nose.

03:28.153 --> 03:29.552
I don't think so.

03:29.593 --> 03:34.825
'She definitely did. Must maintain good
relations. Can't propose in bad odour.

03:34.872 --> 03:39.900
'Jesus! 33% of our
mini-break weekend has already gone!

03:39.952 --> 03:42.830
'Everything's got to be
perfect for the big moment.

03:42.872 --> 03:44.305
Let's just go anywhere.

03:44.352 --> 03:46.229
Well, what about here?

03:46.272 --> 03:50.469
- Do you think? It looks a bit...
- Yeah, sure.

03:50.511 --> 03:53.901
'No, no! I don't know what your
inexpressible criteria are.

03:53.951 --> 03:57.227
'Why don't you tell me
the secret fucking formula? '

03:57.271 --> 03:58.943
Let's go back to the place
with the weird menus.

03:58.991 --> 04:01.664
Back? No, we can't go back,

04:01.711 --> 04:06.023
we've got to push on,
push on to Moscow.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.823
There might be something
in one of the guides.

04:08.870 --> 04:10.667
Mark, put away the guides,

04:10.710 --> 04:13.019
I want to have a real experience,
go to the places no-one goes.

04:13.070 --> 04:15.425
There's probably
a reason why no-one goes

04:15.470 --> 04:18.860
to the places no-one goes - they're
overpriced and have poor service.

04:18.910 --> 04:22.823
Oh, Mark, will you try and leave
the guides out of it,

04:22.869 --> 04:26.384
and try and experience
this bloody town!

04:26.429 --> 04:29.227
'She's posted a book.
I suppose I'm supposed to find

04:29.269 --> 04:31.464
'that incredibly
charming and French.

04:31.509 --> 04:35.138
'Well, it's not,
it's a waste of Â£8.99.

04:35.189 --> 04:38.306
'But I've got to grin and take it,
cos it's the proposal weekend.'

04:40.148 --> 04:44.426
'Great Weekend with a junkie going
cold turkey. I should just leave him.

04:44.468 --> 04:45.981
'What's the worst that could happen?

04:46.028 --> 04:48.383
'He could die.
That would be quite bad.'

04:48.428 --> 04:50.180
- Give us a sip.
- Hans.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.820
Just a sip!

04:51.868 --> 04:53.745
And a toke.

04:53.788 --> 04:55.062
And a line, yeah?

04:55.108 --> 04:59.100
No, come on. I'm not gonna give you
any intoxicants. You made me promise.

04:59.147 --> 05:01.820
Yeah, I know, but that was before.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.459
I wasn't thinking straight.

05:03.507 --> 05:06.977
My head was filled with
bloody mumbo-jumbo, weren't it?

05:07.027 --> 05:11.179
It's all become very clear
to me, Jez, I want some drugs.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.694
No, mate, no.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.624
You stingy bastard.
You're mean.

05:16.666 --> 05:19.134
And you're fat.
And ugly and stupid.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.381
There's no need to be nasty.

05:22.546 --> 05:26.459
I'll stop being nasty if you let me
have a bit of fun, yoghurt cock.

05:26.506 --> 05:28.064
Hey, Big Suze, how you doing?

05:28.106 --> 05:32.417
Never fucking mind about her,
just give me a bang on that pipe!

05:33.785 --> 05:37.539
Yeah, no, nothing much,
just, hanging out. Chilling.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.382
Yeah, that would be nice.

05:39.425 --> 05:41.780
Cool, coolio.

05:41.825 --> 05:46.137
That was Big Suze. Guess what -
she's coming over after all.

05:46.185 --> 05:48.823
Yeah, that's terrific, mate.
Brilliant news.

05:48.864 --> 05:53.380
Super Hans, are you try to
skin up with your feet again?

05:53.424 --> 05:56.734
Because it doesn't work, does it?
It just makes a mess.

06:01.024 --> 06:03.379
So, this is nice.

06:03.424 --> 06:04.492
Lovely.

06:04.543 --> 06:06.454
'This isn't lovely, it's horrible.

06:06.503 --> 06:09.176
'All the people's food looks awful.

06:09.223 --> 06:12.693
'Our engagement dinner in the
Quantocks is going to be terrible.

06:12.743 --> 06:14.620
'I want to cry.

06:14.663 --> 06:16.574
'Oh, my God, we're
not saying anything!

06:16.623 --> 06:19.057
'We've got nothing to say,
we've skipped 20 years.

06:19.103 --> 06:21.297
'We're one of those couples you see.

06:21.342 --> 06:24.493
'Got to say something. Anything! '

06:24.542 --> 06:30.333
So, w-w-w-what do you think of
the... chairs?

06:30.382 --> 06:32.850
Quite... OK, aren't they?

06:32.902 --> 06:35.780
Yeah, they're pretty OK chairs.

06:35.822 --> 06:38.938
Excuse me, do you have a light?

06:38.981 --> 06:40.972
Oh, sorry, we don't smoke.

06:41.021 --> 06:42.739
He thinks I hide his lighter.

06:42.781 --> 06:46.330
Do I look like the sort of woman
who'd hide her husband's lighter?

06:46.381 --> 06:47.700
No, not at all.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.814
She also doesn't look like the sort
of person who'd strangle a cat,

06:51.861 --> 06:55.170
but I haven't seen Castro
in four days.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.690
'Spider senses tingling,
there's something wrong with them.

06:58.740 --> 07:02.813
'What is it, booze, drugs, sex?
Mental health issues? '

07:02.860 --> 07:07.809
Sophie, are you all right with this?
Because if you're not, we can always...

07:07.860 --> 07:10.896
I'm fine. It's nice
to talk to some real people.

07:10.939 --> 07:15.012
'She goes looking for fun after just
a minute of uncomfortable silence.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.527
'Well, get used to it
because when we're married,

07:17.579 --> 07:20.696
'there'll be a lot more
where that came from! '

07:22.579 --> 07:24.012
It was nice at first...

07:24.059 --> 07:25.538
'She's come down to see me!

07:25.579 --> 07:29.127
'This is amazing! Walking in
the grounds of a country hotel.

07:29.178 --> 07:33.012
'lf there wasn't a junkie in my room,
shitting and retching and hurling,

07:33.058 --> 07:34.935
'it'd be like Pride And Prejudice.'

07:34.978 --> 07:38.527
I just took a look around and
I thought, really, is this me?

07:38.578 --> 07:43.606
'Ooh, wasn't listening. Just keep
saying general words, should be OK.'

07:43.658 --> 07:46.376
Shit, yeah, God.
I sometimes think stuff like that.

07:46.417 --> 07:49.693
You know, kind of deep stuff,
shit, in your head.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.090
Exactly!

07:53.057 --> 07:54.775
Hi, Super Hans.

07:54.817 --> 07:56.375
'Come back, man, please!

07:56.417 --> 07:59.773
'I've got a monkey on my back
the size of King Kong.

07:59.817 --> 08:02.011
'I'm being fucked by King Kong! '

08:02.056 --> 08:04.775
Yeah, no, tuck into the KitKats.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.044
'I'm going to cut my tongue off
with a rusty razor.'

08:06.096 --> 08:08.610
Good luck with that. See you later.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.725
Where is he? Is he OK?

08:09.776 --> 08:13.451
Yeah, he's fine, he's back in London,
reading a classic car mag.

08:13.496 --> 08:18.285
Oh, OK. So listen, Jez, you want to
go back to your room and cuddle up

08:18.335 --> 08:20.132
and watch a little bit of cable?

08:20.175 --> 08:23.611
'Oh, she's actually hot for me.
But can't use the room.

08:23.655 --> 08:27.853
'Maybe we could do it behind
a bush, or under a car? '

08:29.415 --> 08:33.453
I always thought she could have had
kids if she'd tried a bit harder.

08:33.495 --> 08:35.485
I never even wanted kids. >

08:35.534 --> 08:38.606
I'd come down to breakfast
and all he'd want to talk about was

08:38.654 --> 08:41.611
cervixes and fallopian tubes.

08:41.654 --> 08:45.852
'Great, gynaecology My favourite
topic of conversation with strangers.

08:45.894 --> 08:49.364
I thought by now I'd be an earth
mother with 12 kids round my skirts.

08:49.414 --> 08:53.122
'Gotta get her away from these
freaks and pop the question.'

08:53.173 --> 08:56.483
Sophie, it's getting late,
should we be erm?

08:56.533 --> 08:59.570
What about our walk
with Gerard and Isabelle?

08:59.613 --> 09:01.888
'Got to get her on her own.'

09:01.933 --> 09:06.927
It's The Apprentice final tonight so
we can't miss that. We've got to go.

09:06.973 --> 09:09.167
But it's so beautiful out there.

09:09.212 --> 09:12.363
Yes but Sugar's got it in
for the short guy.

09:12.412 --> 09:15.245
If you want to watch it,
then come and find us

09:15.292 --> 09:18.364
or I'll see you back at the hotel
a bit later, OK?

09:18.412 --> 09:21.404
'Oh, bollocks! I'm gonna end up
proposing on the M4,

09:21.452 --> 09:24.569
'possibly the M25!
How romantic will that be

09:24.612 --> 09:26.488
'And it's all gonna be her fault.

09:26.531 --> 09:30.490
'Why won't that stupid bitch
let me propose to her? '

09:32.051 --> 09:34.884
'Ah! That smarts!

09:34.931 --> 09:38.082
'Horrible whisky.

09:38.131 --> 09:41.726
'Still, midnight down the bar,
can't have a chocolate milkshake.

09:41.771 --> 09:46.605
'Jesus! What am I gonna do?
I've got to ask her.

'Or maybe just slope home,
never mention it,

not to say jokes about it.

gotta get my thoughts straight.

but he's my idiot.</i>

- Jeremy?
- Mark?

10:08.009 --> 10:09.124
What are you doing here?!

10:09.169 --> 10:12.127
Nothing. I'm here with Big Suze.
You said that was allowed.

10:12.169 --> 10:14.478
Hi, Mark.

10:14.529 --> 10:17.759
What are you doing sleeping here?
Why aren't you in your hotel room?

10:17.808 --> 10:20.117
Yeah, Jez, the maid
must be finished by now.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.762
Yeah, I'll just go and check on that.

10:24.408 --> 10:26.603
The maid? At midnight?

10:26.648 --> 10:28.559
What have you done to the room?

10:28.608 --> 10:30.644
You haven't abused the mega-deal?

10:30.688 --> 10:35.078
Well, the thing is -
and don't take this badly,

10:35.127 --> 10:37.721
but Super Hans has come up,

10:37.767 --> 10:40.645
but you'll approve because
he's trying to come off the drugs.

10:40.687 --> 10:44.726
Super Hans?! Going cold turkey
on my Sunday Times mega-deal?!

10:44.767 --> 10:46.359
Oh, that is too rich!

10:47.847 --> 10:49.121
It's Sophie.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.997
Hey, Soph, you got bored of?

10:52.046 --> 10:54.924
OK, OK, don't panic. Where are you?

10:54.966 --> 10:59.562
Don't move. I'll be there any
minute. Everything's gonna be fine.

11:00.606 --> 11:01.356
Is she not OK?

11:01.406 --> 11:05.399
She went for a walk with these
two idiots drinking sloe gin.

11:05.446 --> 11:08.118
Now they've left her.
She's scared and lost.

11:08.165 --> 11:10.838
I'm gonna go and find her.

11:12.445 --> 11:15.482
Ah, God, that's horrible!

11:15.525 --> 11:17.720
I could do with a hand.

11:17.765 --> 11:21.235
'I don't wanna go, but apparently
you can't just do whatever you want

11:21.285 --> 11:22.842
because of "civilisation".'

11:22.884 --> 11:25.876
Er, yeah, sure, mate.
Did she say where she was?

11:25.924 --> 11:27.960
She thought she was near a big rock.

11:28.004 --> 11:30.757
Oh, great, well,
that should be simple enough

11:30.804 --> 11:32.283
That's what I was gonna say,

11:32.324 --> 11:35.634
and then I thought, a bit more
comforting and Des Lynam now,

11:35.684 --> 11:38.073
I can be all Jimmy Carr
about it later.

11:40.923 --> 11:43.073
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

11:44.203 --> 11:47.639
- Did she say what sort of rock it was?
- No.

11:47.683 --> 11:49.401
Why were you phoning me anyway?

11:49.443 --> 11:53.038
I wanted to talk some stuff through
with someone, you big dick!

11:53.083 --> 11:56.075
What stuff? You're not having
gay feelings again, Mark?

11:56.123 --> 11:57.794
No! One time that happened.

12:00.122 --> 12:01.680
It's her.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.032
Soph, I want you to remain calm,

12:05.082 --> 12:08.392
but can you give me a description
of the rock at all?

12:08.442 --> 12:13.834
Is it mossy, for example?
Oh, great. No, no, that's fine.

12:13.881 --> 12:15.678
Sure. See you soon.

12:17.681 --> 12:19.080
She's back at the hotel.

12:19.121 --> 12:22.557
She found Gerard and Isabelle
about five minutes after she called us.

12:22.601 --> 12:24.080
Oh, for fuck's sake!

12:24.121 --> 12:26.351
Mark, is this?

12:26.401 --> 12:28.278
Are we going the right way?

12:28.321 --> 12:30.197
We're going down
so it must be right.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.310
Except we went down and then up.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.873
We should just keep going.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.230
We're bound to hit something soon.
We should probably hurry cos

12:37.280 --> 12:40.397
Sophie said there might be
a bit of a thunderstorm coming in.

12:40.440 --> 12:44.558
Oh, great We have no idea where we
are, there might be a storm coming in

12:44.600 --> 12:46.591
and we haven't got any stuff and...

12:46.640 --> 12:48.231
Brilliant We're dead meat.

12:48.279 --> 12:50.839
This isn't the Matterhorn,
it's the Quantocks.

12:50.879 --> 12:52.710
Nobody dies in the Quantocks.

12:52.759 --> 12:55.876
If we're very unlucky, we might
have wandered onto Exmoor.

12:55.919 --> 12:59.355
Exmoor?! The moors?! The barren
moors? The moors murderers?

12:59.399 --> 13:02.471
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

13:02.519 --> 13:04.509
- I'm gonna call mountain rescue.
- No.

13:04.558 --> 13:07.675
- That's what they're there for.
- We're not calling mountain rescue.

13:07.718 --> 13:10.471
We're not gonna be two of
those idiots you hear about

13:10.518 --> 13:13.316
who go up mountains in flip-flops
and have to get rescued.

13:13.358 --> 13:16.236
You'd rather be one of the idiots
they find frozen to death,

13:16.278 --> 13:18.473
chewed by badgers,
drinking their own piss?

13:18.518 --> 13:21.350
You can't call mountain rescue.
It's only a hill.

13:21.397 --> 13:23.991
They'll let me die because
I haven't got a geography degree

13:24.037 --> 13:28.076
You'd prefer to die rather than
ask for a simple piece of help.

13:30.037 --> 13:31.834
We are so going to die.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.754
Will you please stop saying that?

13:34.317 --> 13:36.148
Ow! Bollocks! Fuck!

13:36.197 --> 13:37.027
What is it?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.748
Shit, my ankle!

13:38.796 --> 13:40.593
Come here, mate, I've got you.

13:42.236 --> 13:44.033
Come and sit over here.

13:44.076 --> 13:47.432
'Ah, ankle, here we go.
In a couple of hours, we'll be dead.'

13:47.476 --> 13:51.310
Look, seriously, mate,
do you want me to go up there a bit

13:51.356 --> 13:54.108
and try and get
a bit of reception, yeah?

13:54.155 --> 13:55.668
Er, no.

13:55.715 --> 13:56.625
No?

13:56.675 --> 13:59.553
No, mate, no, don't leave.

13:59.595 --> 14:01.745
I'm not being rude.

14:01.795 --> 14:05.993
If you go, you won't come back.

14:06.035 --> 14:07.787
You'll leave me here to die.

14:07.835 --> 14:11.463
Ah, so, now you're admitting
that one of us might die.

14:11.514 --> 14:14.233
Nobody is gonna die.
This is southern England.

14:14.274 --> 14:17.823
Nobody dies in southern England,
Jeremy, that just doesn't happen.

14:17.874 --> 14:21.423
Now, I haven't told you
about this before but...

14:21.474 --> 14:24.511
I actually have a bar of
Dairy Milk with me.

14:24.554 --> 14:26.590
I think it's time
we rationed it out.

14:26.634 --> 14:29.864
Can't we just have a bit?
We've only been lost for 20 minutes

14:29.913 --> 14:32.632
and you want to start rationing?
Let's just eat it.

14:32.673 --> 14:35.028
It's not worth starting rationing
once we've eaten it.

14:35.073 --> 14:36.108
You love rationing.

14:36.153 --> 14:40.385
You've been waiting for an opportunity to do
rationing on me since the day we met

14:40.433 --> 14:44.187
and finally one's come along
and you love it, don't you?

14:44.233 --> 14:46.427
I just thought a block
each every two hours and...

14:46.472 --> 14:48.144
Bollocks. Give me my half now.

14:48.192 --> 14:49.705
You can ration yourself.

14:49.752 --> 14:55.429
If you insist, there's seven segments
so that's three each with one left over,

14:55.472 --> 14:58.669
which is mine
seeing as it's all mine.

14:58.712 --> 15:02.021
The spirit of the Blitz lives on.
Fucking hell.

15:02.071 --> 15:03.789
Oh, that is so good

15:03.831 --> 15:06.391
Don't come asking for more when you
didn't have the foresight...

15:06.431 --> 15:08.262
- Can I have a bit more?
- No!

15:08.311 --> 15:09.505
Oh, come on, just a bit.

15:09.551 --> 15:11.269
My half of the fourth chunk. Go on.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.585
Jeremy, I explained to you...

15:12.631 --> 15:15.065
Oh, come on, Mark,
you knew what would happen.

15:15.111 --> 15:17.181
You knew I'd want to eat it.

15:17.231 --> 15:21.143
You know my nature. This isn't fair.
You're using my nature against me.

15:21.190 --> 15:23.226
Let's just concentrate on
getting back to the hotel.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.340
Sure, mate, sure.

15:25.390 --> 15:28.666
And, erm, thanks, mate,
for the chocolate.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.699
Don't mention it.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.743
'Always got the Twix.
No need to mention the Twix.'

15:34.030 --> 15:36.941
Oh, look, a Frisbee.
Somebody left a Frisbee.

15:36.989 --> 15:40.459
We could use this to dig
or maybe catch something - a bird,

15:40.509 --> 15:42.625
if you threw it really hard.

15:42.669 --> 15:47.584
Listen, about this whole
you asking Sophie to get married...

15:47.629 --> 15:49.665
It's brilliant and everything,

15:49.709 --> 15:53.223
but I was wondering, have you
considered, like, not doing it?

15:53.268 --> 15:57.022
Not doing it?! But that's what this
whole weekend's been about.

15:57.068 --> 15:59.184
I saved all those
mega-deal vouchers.

15:59.228 --> 16:02.345
No, obviously,
and after all that clipping,

16:02.388 --> 16:04.697
you'll want something
to show for it. Like a wife.

16:04.748 --> 16:08.945
But... is it really... a good idea?

16:08.987 --> 16:12.775
I dunno, I assumed it was because
I spend all my time thinking about it.

16:12.827 --> 16:14.055
I'm obsessed with it.

16:14.107 --> 16:18.305
Super Hans is obsessed with crack and
poppers and dusting his knob with speed,

16:18.347 --> 16:20.941
but it doesn't make it right.

16:20.987 --> 16:23.342
What is it about her
that you actually love?

16:23.387 --> 16:26.378
Are you kidding? Everything!
Her... You know...

16:26.426 --> 16:31.261
She has changed a bit lately,
but we had this connection.

16:31.306 --> 16:32.705
Right...

16:32.746 --> 16:35.101
Which, admittedly, is kind of going,

16:35.146 --> 16:37.899
but, you know, she's funny.

16:39.386 --> 16:43.378
Although, now I wonder whether she
really WAS funny or whether she was

16:43.425 --> 16:47.100
just being normal, but I liked her
so much I thought she was funny.

16:47.145 --> 16:49.739
Oh, yeah, I know that one.

16:49.785 --> 16:52.538
Plus, when I was at the height of
Sophie madness,

16:52.585 --> 16:55.941
it was when I was watching her
across a hot photocopier,

16:55.985 --> 16:58.942
the little looks, the funny doodles.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.815
Before you had a relationship.

17:00.864 --> 17:03.253
Exactly. It's almost like...

17:03.304 --> 17:07.455
the more we've got to know each
other, the worse it's been.

17:10.344 --> 17:13.858
We really have almost
nothing in common.

17:13.904 --> 17:17.292
Well, maybe that's a sign.

17:17.343 --> 17:19.810
Oh, my God, I...!

17:19.863 --> 17:21.854
I don't have to marry her!

17:23.183 --> 17:25.651
Jez, I'm not going to
ask her to marry me!

17:25.703 --> 17:28.581
There might even be
other women in the country

17:28.623 --> 17:32.774
who are willing to speak to me
and I can go out and find them!

17:32.822 --> 17:35.939
Or give up on women and eat
toasted sandwiches and watch TV!

17:35.982 --> 17:37.893
Don't give up on women, mate.

17:37.942 --> 17:42.697
There's she-males, hookers,
Thai brides, all God's rich tapestry.

17:42.742 --> 17:44.812
Brilliant! I feel good!

17:44.862 --> 17:46.932
Hey, isn't this?

17:46.982 --> 17:50.132
Jez, this is a footpath! A genuine,

17:50.181 --> 17:52.979
National Trust-maintained
public right of way!

17:53.021 --> 17:55.899
Great, fantastic!
Let's go down, shall we?

17:55.941 --> 17:58.501
We can snaffle the rest
of the choco, go 50-50.

17:58.541 --> 18:02.375
Jez, where are you going,
you great doofus? It's this way.

18:02.421 --> 18:04.935
No, this way - down.

18:04.981 --> 18:06.572
Down the mountain, remember?

18:06.620 --> 18:09.976
No, we went down and then up.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.251
I've just got this
really strong feeling that I'm right

18:13.300 --> 18:15.609
and you should give in
because we both know

18:15.660 --> 18:17.969
I'm more stubborn than you,
so give in now.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.488
Normally I give in,
but today I'm right

18:20.540 --> 18:23.053
and I don't want to go
back up the mountain.

18:23.099 --> 18:27.217
Honestly, if you really are
gonna go that way, take my fleece

18:27.259 --> 18:30.296
and my secret Twix because

18:30.339 --> 18:34.696
you are definitely gonna be spending
a long, cold night on the moors.

18:34.739 --> 18:38.368
Great The secret Twix! When
were you gonna tell me about this?

18:38.419 --> 18:40.568
Or were you gonna wait until I was dead

18:40.618 --> 18:44.247
and have it for dessert after
you'd feasted on my carcass?

18:45.938 --> 18:48.372
'Fucking hell, that took for ever!

18:48.418 --> 18:52.411
'Finally back. He's always right.
Why is he always right? '

18:52.458 --> 18:55.734
Jez, I'm so glad to see you,
I was worried about you.

18:55.778 --> 18:59.656
Do you want to go and cuddle up
somewhere soft and warm and...

18:59.697 --> 19:02.336
you know?

19:02.377 --> 19:04.208
I know, honey.

19:04.257 --> 19:06.771
Just give me five, yeah?

19:06.817 --> 19:10.969
'Wow! I'm just so tired and hungry
and cold, she'll have a hell of a job

19:11.017 --> 19:15.294
'coaxing a hard-on out of me.
But I bet she'll manage.'

19:15.336 --> 19:19.124
Oh, Hans! Super Hans!

19:20.776 --> 19:22.573
Jez.

19:22.616 --> 19:25.688
Hi, Super Hans. How are you doing?

19:25.736 --> 19:30.172
I just wondered whether
you still wanted some drugs?

19:30.215 --> 19:31.170
What?

19:31.215 --> 19:35.652
I'm over the hump,
but yeah, I'd love some drugs.

19:35.695 --> 19:39.210
And that's definitely your
settled decision as a grown-up man?

19:39.255 --> 19:44.409
I've got nothing to feel guilty
about if I gave you some?

19:44.455 --> 19:45.649
Not really.

19:45.695 --> 19:49.687
OK. This is a big bag of drugs.

19:49.734 --> 19:54.888
All I'm gonna do is just...
tape it on here like this,

19:54.934 --> 19:57.402
and then, you know...

20:01.094 --> 20:03.130
Have fun!

20:04.173 --> 20:05.925
Drugs.

20:05.973 --> 20:08.328
Drugs. Drugs!

20:10.013 --> 20:12.811
Hey, Soph. Where's the Markster?

20:12.853 --> 20:14.809
Practising his l-told-you-so's?

20:14.853 --> 20:18.289
He's not back. I haven't slept a wink.
Do you think he's all right?

20:18.333 --> 20:19.402
You're kidding?!

20:19.453 --> 20:21.488
Is that Mark's fleece?

20:21.532 --> 20:25.969
I didn't kill him.
I had the opportunity, but no motive.

20:26.012 --> 20:28.242
I mean, don't worry, Sophie,
he'll be fine.

20:28.292 --> 20:32.080
I'm sure. It's just I feel guilty.

20:32.132 --> 20:34.521
I was such an idiot and he just
rushed out straight away

20:34.572 --> 20:37.449
to try and find me
because he's so lovely like that.

20:37.491 --> 20:40.483
I feel like I'm always the one.
He's such a good person.

20:40.531 --> 20:44.922
I'm always going on and on
about the juice bar and smoothies.

20:44.971 --> 20:47.360
It's only fruit squashed up
for God's sake!

20:47.411 --> 20:48.480
Mark!

20:48.531 --> 20:50.362
Mark, you're safe! Brilliant.

20:50.411 --> 20:53.925
Mark, I'm so glad to see you!

20:53.970 --> 20:56.689
Hello. Hello, Jez.

20:56.730 --> 21:00.006
And I was right, you were wrong.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.565
You're wet through and unhappy
because you didn't listen to me.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.249
What happened?

21:06.290 --> 21:11.204
Well, I sort of slipped
into a kind of mini ravine

21:11.249 --> 21:17.802
and I angered a crow
that was defending its young.

21:17.849 --> 21:25.164
Then I eventually got a bit of, not
exactly sleep, in a disused barn.

21:25.209 --> 21:28.518
Oh...! I was right.

21:28.568 --> 21:32.447
Look at you, you're actually
shivering. Brilliant.

21:32.488 --> 21:36.527
'I can't believe I pissed on my
legs to keep myself warm.'

21:36.568 --> 21:37.478
Thanks, Soph.

21:37.528 --> 21:40.406
I just wanted to say
I'm so sorry for last night

21:40.448 --> 21:45.362
and being a big idiot. You and me,
we've had lots of ups and downs,

21:45.407 --> 21:47.159
and I guess the truth is

21:47.207 --> 21:51.439
we just have lots of differences
and different interests.

21:51.487 --> 21:53.762
Yeah, I know, Soph, so...

21:53.807 --> 21:57.516
But at some point, you have to say,
OK, I don't live in a fairy tale

21:57.567 --> 22:00.764
and we can have our own
interests and friends

22:00.807 --> 22:05.084
and I might do a bit more clubbing
and you might do a bit more...

22:05.126 --> 22:08.801
history, but that doesn't mean
we can't have a nice time.

22:08.846 --> 22:11.121
And neither of us are
getting any younger

22:11.166 --> 22:15.398
and I might want some
little people around sometime soon.

22:15.446 --> 22:17.482
So what I'm saying is, yes.

22:19.045 --> 22:20.524
What to?

22:20.565 --> 22:25.161
Your alarm clock went off.
So I went into your bag to turn it off

22:25.205 --> 22:29.881
and I accidentally found
something round and engagementy.

22:29.925 --> 22:31.643
Oh, right.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.118
'Shit!! '

22:33.165 --> 22:35.632
I've not got it wrong?
You were going to?

22:35.684 --> 22:37.515
Yeah, yeah, no...

22:37.564 --> 22:39.441
Well then, yes!

22:39.484 --> 22:43.193
Right then... hooray.

22:43.964 --> 22:47.115
Guess what! We're engaged,
we're gonna get married!

22:47.164 --> 22:49.473
Jez, they're gonna get married!

22:49.524 --> 22:50.479
No, no, they're not.

22:50.524 --> 22:51.797
Yes, yes, we are.

22:51.843 --> 22:53.720
You are?

22:53.763 --> 22:55.276
Yep.

22:55.323 --> 22:58.872
Isn't it... great?

23:00.283 --> 23:02.319
Congratulations.

23:02.363 --> 23:04.672
Are you feeling all right now, mate?

23:04.723 --> 23:06.361
Oh, yeah. Yep.

23:06.403 --> 23:10.077
I'd probably be very angry at you
if I wasn't so incredibly high.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.398
So, Mark, congrats.

23:13.442 --> 23:14.921
Thank you, thanks.

23:14.962 --> 23:17.601
So, what the fuck?

23:17.642 --> 23:20.361
What happened,
did you change your mind?

23:20.402 --> 23:24.077
Well, no, not really.
She found the ring.

23:24.122 --> 23:26.555
- Right.
- She said yes, she accepted.

23:26.601 --> 23:27.477
But you hadn't asked.

23:27.521 --> 23:30.319
There was a ring,
that's an effective proposal.

23:30.361 --> 23:32.955
So you accepted the acceptance?

23:33.001 --> 23:35.469
I had to - it was checkmate,
there was no way out.

23:35.521 --> 23:37.716
Except for telling her how you felt.

23:37.761 --> 23:39.638
Sure, like that was gonna happen

23:39.681 --> 23:42.672
I had to accept.
It would have been too embarrassing

23:42.720 --> 23:44.631
not to accept the acceptance.

23:44.680 --> 23:48.832
So you're going to get married
to her out of embarrassment?

23:48.880 --> 23:50.108
There are worse reasons.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.435
I suppose you could
always get divorced.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.153
Oh, no, I'm not the divorcing type.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.670
So you're going to stay married to
this woman for the rest of your life

23:59.719 --> 24:01.391
because of embarrassment?

24:01.439 --> 24:03.953
Yes, probably.

24:03.999 --> 24:07.275
I'd be grateful if,
for the rest of my life,

24:07.319 --> 24:10.197
you never mention it again.

24:10.239 --> 24:11.467
OK?

24:11.519 --> 24:14.272
Fair enough.

24:14.319 --> 24:15.354
To the happy couple!

24:15.398 --> 24:17.150
The happy couple.

24:17.198 --> 24:21.396
'This is good. Not really loving her
puts me in a position of power.

24:21.438 --> 24:23.793
'I win. Sort of.'
