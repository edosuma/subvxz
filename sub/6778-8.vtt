HOME BOX OFFICE, INC.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.469
I DID.

01:47.370 --> 01:48.735
NO.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.468
I SWEAR,
I WAS LIKE MAJORLY,

01:51.570 --> 01:57.679
INTENSELY... WORKED UP,
LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.510
TRUST ME,
THAT'S SO NOT IT.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.781
QUIT LOOKING AT ME LIKE
I'M THE NEW ZOO BABY.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.187
I DID COME.

02:06.290 --> 02:09.179
HONEY,
THERE'S NO WAY.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.020
I WAS THERE,
REMEMBER ?

02:12.130 --> 02:16.567
WAS NO FUNNY FACE,
NO FUNNY NOISES,

02:16.670 --> 02:20.936
YOU DIDN'T MELT INTO A SMOKING
LITTLE PUDDLE OF CLAIRE...

02:21.040 --> 02:23.838
YET.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.029
THIS SUCKS.

02:26.140 --> 02:27.107
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH ME ?

02:27.210 --> 02:28.404
NOTHING.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.341
WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.975
YOU WAIT AND SEE,
I'LL MAKE YOU SCREAM.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.275
I HOPE SO.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.147
GEORGE, COME
TO CHURCH WITH ME.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.956
AGNOSTICS DON'T USUALLY
GO TO CHURCH, RUTH.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.051
THAT'S PART
OF THE APPEAL.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.128
IT WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY
TO BE THERE WITH YOU.

02:46.230 --> 02:49.097
SWEETHEART, THIS IS
MY DAY TO CATCH UP,

02:49.200 --> 02:51.122
I GOT A MILLION
THINGS TO DO.

02:51.230 --> 02:52.561
IT'S ONLY AN HOUR.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.968
THEN YOU WON'T
MISS ME FOR LONG.

02:55.070 --> 02:58.039
MORNING, ALL.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.368
HEY.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.004
CAN I GET
YOU ANYTHING ?

03:01.110 --> 03:02.247
HOW ARE YOU ?

03:02.350 --> 03:03.499
UH, ORANGE JUICE.

03:03.610 --> 03:04.474
I'M GREAT.

03:04.580 --> 03:07.469
WELL, MY STOMACH
IS BURNING...

03:07.580 --> 03:08.478
A LITTLE.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.184
MAYBE TOO
MUCH COFFEE.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.882
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
YOU NEED WATER.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.150
JUICE WOULD
PRODUCE MORE ACID.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.353
NO BODIES
IN THE PREP ROOM.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.678
YOU THINK DEATH SPARED
LOS ANGELES LAST NIGHT ?

03:17.790 --> 03:18.882
HIGHLY DOUBTFUL.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.628
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

03:20.730 --> 03:22.618
I DON'T KNOW, I SHOULD BE HERE
IN CASE WE GET A WALK-IN.

03:22.730 --> 03:25.665
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU TODAY ?

03:25.770 --> 03:27.567
I HAVE TO WORK

03:27.670 --> 03:30.366
AND YOUR MOTHER'S
GOT THE SPIRIT.

03:30.470 --> 03:33.007
TO COME TO CHURCH WITH ME ?

03:33.110 --> 03:34.429
YES, I'D LIKE THAT...

03:34.540 --> 03:35.905
VERY MUCH.

03:36.010 --> 03:36.977
I'LL BE READY
IN A MINUTE.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.547
HERE, DRINK
YOUR WATER.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.008
LAST CHANCE.

03:42.120 --> 03:45.339
PRAY FOR ME.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.821
MMM.

05:00.930 --> 05:04.093
HELLO.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.225
RICO...

05:06.340 --> 05:09.229
YOU WERE SUCH
A LOVER LAST NIGHT.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.865
SO GOOD, MMM.

05:11.970 --> 05:16.998
NO, IT WAS YOU.

05:17.110 --> 05:23.948
MMM, MMM, MMM.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.486
WAIT, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE ?

05:29.290 --> 05:32.828
IT'S LATE,
YOU GOTTA GO HOME.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.025
COO, MAN,
IT'S ALMOST 11.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.633
JUST TELL YOUR WIFE
YOU FELL ASLEEP IN THE CAR.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.231
SHE THREW ME OUT.

05:44.340 --> 05:45.261
SHUT UP.

05:45.370 --> 05:46.234
FOR REAL ?

05:46.340 --> 05:47.932
YEAH, FOR REAL.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.570
HMM.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.343
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE
SHE THINKS IS OUT THERE.

05:57.450 --> 05:58.940
GIVE UP A MAN
LIKE YOU ?

05:59.050 --> 06:04.078
SHE'S FUCKED UP.

06:04.190 --> 06:08.399
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT HER.

06:12.770 --> 06:15.568
HEY, I COULD STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE, RIGHT ?

06:18.310 --> 06:19.971
OH, I'M SORRY, BABY.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.298
IT'S JUST THAT THIS
APARTMENT IS SO SMALL

06:22.410 --> 06:25.243
AND MY COUSINS,
THEY VISIT ALL THE TIME,

06:25.350 --> 06:26.715
THEY HAVE
TO SLEEP OVER.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.173
OH.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.180
NO PROBLEM.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.416
( clearing throat)

06:31.520 --> 06:33.249
LOVE YOUR ENEMY.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.782
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.882
WHAT COULD BE MORE SIMPLE
OR MORE DIFFICULT ?

06:37.990 --> 06:41.551
BUT THESE ARE THE TEACHINGS
AT THE LIVING HEART

06:41.660 --> 06:44.322
OF CHRIST'S MESSAGE
TO THE WORLD.

06:44.430 --> 06:47.695
WHEN PETER ASKED
JESUS, "LORD,

06:47.800 --> 06:50.303
"HOW OFT SHALL I
FORGIVE MY BROTHER ?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.866
SEVEN TIMES ?"

06:51.970 --> 06:54.609
SEEMS LIKE A LOT,
DOESN'T IT, SEVEN TIMES.

06:54.710 --> 06:58.077
BUT JESUS SAID TO PETER,
"NOT SEVEN TIMES,

06:58.180 --> 07:00.978
BUT 70 TIMES SEVEN !"

07:01.080 --> 07:03.241
WHOA.

07:03.350 --> 07:04.988
DO THE MATH.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.910
( laughing )

07:07.020 --> 07:09.488
YOU STUPID HYPOCRITE !

07:11.330 --> 07:12.649
NO!

07:18.470 --> 07:19.732
HOW DOES IT FEEL ?

07:20.370 --> 07:21.837
( gunshot)

07:21.940 --> 07:25.535
SO IT IS OUR DAILY MISSION
TO FIND THE CHRIST IN OURSELVES,

07:25.640 --> 07:28.768
AND FORGIVE OUR ENEMIES...

07:28.880 --> 07:31.303
H EARTBU RN.

07:31.410 --> 07:35.141
IT IS FORGIVENESS
THAT EASES OUR SUFFERING.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.024
( panting )

08:00.980 --> 08:03.073
NICE RIDE.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.542
GODDAMT.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.813
( playing horn )

08:26.300 --> 08:27.836
WHAT ?

08:27.940 --> 08:31.137
LET'S GO AWAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.971
WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO GO ?

08:35.080 --> 08:36.570
NORTH ?

08:36.680 --> 08:38.341
WE COULD LEAVE
TOMORROW AND--

08:38.450 --> 08:39.712
CAN'T.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.378
I'M SCORING THE NEW
JET LI MOVIE TOMORROW.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.483
IT'S THE NEXT
COUPLE DAYS ACTUALLY,

08:44.590 --> 08:45.943
SO YOU'RE HARDLY
GONNA SEE ME.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.256
OH, WELL.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.510
SORRY.

08:52.530 --> 08:55.419
BUT AFTERWARDS,
MAYBE.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.966
CAM BRIA,
CARMEL, MONTERREY...

08:59.070 --> 09:00.992
WELL, THAT'D WORK.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.573
IF YOU HAVE NO
INTEREST IN THE PAST,

09:10.680 --> 09:11.874
AND YOU DON'T
READ HISTORY,

09:11.980 --> 09:13.948
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY
COMPREHEND THE PRESENT ?

09:14.050 --> 09:17.087
GEORGE, HISTORY IS NOT
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED,

09:17.190 --> 09:19.988
HISTORY IS SOME STUPID
WARMONGERING PATRIARCHAL IDEA

09:20.090 --> 09:22.217
OF WHAT HAPPENED,
WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THAT.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.288
I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.529
ANITA HERE THINKS THE STUDY
OF FOSSILS IS FUTILE.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.598
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.292
DAVE, WE'RE
GETTING A BODY.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.527
WHO, HOW, WHAT ?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.528
I THINK YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
PART OF YOUR OUTFIT, ANITA.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.891
I WAS GONNA
WEAR A T-SHIRT OVER,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.706
THEN I WAS LIKE,
AH, FUCK IT.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.802
HE WAS SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY
IN THIS MINT '605 LINCOLN

09:40.910 --> 09:42.502
WITH A PRE-NEED FORM
FROM DAD

09:42.610 --> 09:44.202
SITTING RIGHT
ON TOP OF THE DASH.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.709
WHERE IS HE NOW ?

09:45.810 --> 09:47.516
HE'S AT THE CORONER'S,
BUT HE'S GONNA BE BACK SOON.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.212
I THOUGHT YOUR DAY
WAS GOING TO BE FILLED

09:49.320 --> 09:50.548
WITH IMPORTANT
ACTIVITIES.

09:50.650 --> 09:51.947
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME
FOR HEALTHY DEBATE.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.119
WHAT DEBATE ?

09:53.220 --> 09:54.448
I'M RIGHT,
YOU'RE WRONG,
GAME OVER.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.788
( laughing )

09:55.890 --> 09:57.118
RICO'S GONNA WORK ON HIM
I'M GONNA BE THERE,

09:57.230 --> 09:58.356
SO YOU
DON'T HAVE TO--

09:58.460 --> 09:59.279
I WANT TO.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.948
I NEED TO DO
SOMETHING.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.893
HEY, MOM, CAN YOU LOOK AFTER
MAYA FOR A LITTLE WHILE ?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.631
THERE YOU GO.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.093
THANKS, MOM.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.431
BUT EVERYTHING WE ARE
IS BUILT ON WHAT WENT BEFORE,

10:12.540 --> 10:15.008
OUR FOUNDATION
IS THE EARTH--

10:15.110 --> 10:17.271
CALIFORNIA'S MADE OF DUST,
IT'S FALLING INTO THE OCEAN,

10:17.380 --> 10:19.940
YOU CALL THAT
A FOUNDATION ?

10:20.050 --> 10:22.780
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE,
GERTRUDE AND ALICE.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.346
OH, WELL,
LOOK AT HER,

10:24.450 --> 10:26.816
WERE WE SUPPOSED
TO DRESS '805
AND NOBODY CALLED ?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.581
TAKE A BREAK,
LADIES.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.885
CLAIRE, THE COACH HOUSE
WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE

10:30.990 --> 10:32.480
FOR YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
TO GATHER.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.989
DON'T WORRY, MOM,
WE'RE LEAVING.

10:34.100 --> 10:34.998
C'MON, ANITA.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.796
KEEP UP, EDIE,
THE '805 ARE BACK.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.033
PRETTY FUNNY.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.028
HILARIOUS.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.741
THIS IS A $1,000 SUIT.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.876
YOU THINK
YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.141
SOMEBODY COULD HAVE SET HIM UP
IN THE CAR AND RUN AWAY.

10:57.250 --> 11:01.254
OR MAYBE HE DIED
IN A COMPROMISING POSITION.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.123
LIKE, YOU KNOW...

11:03.230 --> 11:05.448
HE'S 80.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.551
IT HAPPENS.

11:07.660 --> 11:08.922
RICO, I'M TELLING YOU,

11:09.030 --> 11:10.429
THIS GUY DROVE HIMSELF
TO HIS OWN FUNERAL.

11:10.530 --> 11:11.690
HI, IT'S ME.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.789
HEY, YOU,
WHAT'S UP ?

11:12.900 --> 11:14.834
Oh, nothing,
missed you.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.168
WE HAVEN'T TALKED
SINCE YESTERDAY.

11:16.270 --> 11:18.261
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WE TALKED THIS MORNING.

11:18.370 --> 11:20.008
WE DID ?

11:20.110 --> 11:21.805
Yeah, I called you
before I left the hotel.

11:21.910 --> 11:25.744
OH, YEAH, RIGHT,
I SPACED, SORRY.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.216
YOU DON'T SOUND
LIKE YOURSELF.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.673
NO, I'M FINE,
IT'S JUST--

11:29.790 --> 11:32.884
BODIES ARE COMING
IN LEI-T AND RIGHT TODAY.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.811
NATE, RICO, I'LL BE
THERE IN A SECOND.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.889
David, tell me
the truth.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.254
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THESE
LONG-DISTANCE THINGS WORK.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.327
NO, I GOTTA GO.

11:42.430 --> 11:43.522
I'LL CALL YOU LATER,

11:43.630 --> 11:44.619
or you call me.

11:44.730 --> 11:46.834
I'M FINE,
BE CAREFUL, BYE.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.637
HE'S NOT FINE.

11:50.740 --> 11:52.799
YOU THINK ?

11:52.910 --> 11:54.901
RUSSELL'S
SUPPOSED BE HERE.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.773
IS HE BAILING
ON THIS ?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.006
HE'S ASLEEP.

11:58.110 --> 11:59.577
I FUCKED HIM INTO
UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.511
YOU KNOW, IT REALLY
COSTS A LOT OF MONEY

12:01.620 --> 12:02.985
TO RENT CHAINSAWS.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.739
AND IF WE ACCIDENTALLY,
YOU KNOW, LIKE CHOP SOMEBODY UP,

12:04.850 --> 12:06.579
TH EY'LL TOTALLY
SUE OUR ASS.

12:06.690 --> 12:08.009
I'M NOT SAYING TO DO
THAT EXACT THING--

12:08.120 --> 12:09.849
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO BRAINSTORM A DARK, EDGY--

12:09.960 --> 12:12.827
LIKE CONFRONTATIONAL CONCEPT,
WHERE'S YOURS ?

12:12.930 --> 12:15.490
I'M SORRY, ATTACKING WITH
CHAINSAWS IS A TOTAL CLICH.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.999
MACH ETES.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.795
OKAY, CLAIRE, WE STAND
AT THE ENTRANCE

12:18.900 --> 12:20.697
WITH MASKS AND MACHETES,
LIKE AN IMAGE OF MENACE.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.667
MACHETES HAVE
NO RESONANCE--

12:23.770 --> 12:24.907
FOR OUR CULTURE.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.363
WHAT ARE YOU,
CONJOINED TWINS ?

12:26.470 --> 12:29.337
JESUS.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.076
YOU SENT THE KIDS
TO THE PARK WITH CASSIDY ?

12:35.180 --> 12:38.183
VANESSA, I HAVE
A RIGHT TO SEE THEM.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.053
WELL, THEY DON'T NEED
TO BE EXPOSED TO YOU,

12:40.160 --> 12:41.957
WITH YOUR HOOCHIE MAMA,
WHO KNOWS WHERE SHE'S BEEN.

12:43.890 --> 12:45.619
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LISTEN TO ME ?

12:45.730 --> 12:47.049
I'LL SLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.253
COME ON, WE CAN TALK TONIGHT,
NOT FIGHT, TALK.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.361
NO!

12:50.470 --> 12:51.789
HOW COULD YOU ?

12:51.900 --> 12:53.731
ALL THAT TIME, COME HOME
TO US AI-TER SCREWING HER.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.728
I NEVER
SCREWED HER !

12:55.840 --> 12:57.137
NEVER UNTIL
LAST NIGHT !

12:57.240 --> 12:58.502
UGH !

12:58.610 --> 12:59.975
I MEAN--

13:00.080 --> 13:04.301
YOUR MARRIAGE IS ON THE ROCKS
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO ?!

13:04.410 --> 13:06.241
YOU KICKED ME OUT
INTO THE STREET !

13:06.350 --> 13:08.841
YES, I WENT TO HER,
YES, I HAD SEX WITH HER !

13:08.950 --> 13:10.486
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT !

13:10.590 --> 13:12.148
OH MY GOD--

13:12.250 --> 13:13.979
WAIT, WAIT,
I DIDN'T MEAN--

13:14.090 --> 13:15.648
YOU BREAK YOUR VOWS,
YOU FUCK THAT WHORE

13:15.760 --> 13:16.886
AND YOU BLAME ME ?

13:16.990 --> 13:19.652
YOU COWARD, YOU BASTARD,
YOU SONOFABITCH.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.422
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.332
PAPA ALWAYS SAID

13:29.440 --> 13:33.171
WHEN THE TIME CAME,
HE'D PUT ON HIS BEST SUIT

13:33.280 --> 13:35.737
AND TAKE HIMSELF
TO THE FUNERAL HOME.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.603
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.439
UNBELIEVABLE.

13:39.550 --> 13:40.847
NOT IF YOU
KNEW HIM.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.508
HE WAS A
CIVIL ENGINEER.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.985
METICULOUS.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.115
AND HE NEVER WANTED
TO BURDEN US WITH ANYTHING.

13:46.220 --> 13:50.122
HE ALWAYS DID WHAT
HE SAID HE WOULD DO.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.619
YOU COULD ALWAYS
TRUST HIS WORD.

13:52.730 --> 13:53.992
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
LOOKED UP TO HIM.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.455
HE WAS
THE BEST FATHER...

13:56.560 --> 13:58.824
A WONDERFUL
HUSBAND.

13:58.930 --> 14:02.468
SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS
A VERY FINE MAN.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.800
HE WAS, HE WAS.

14:04.910 --> 14:08.209
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

14:08.310 --> 14:12.940
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
SYM PATHY, MR. DIAZ.

14:13.050 --> 14:16.440
I'M REALLY
SORRY, TOO.

14:18.820 --> 14:21.789
SO WE'LL SEE YOU TUESDAY
FOR THE SERVICE.

14:21.890 --> 14:25.280
HE PLANNED
ALL THAT, AS WELL.

14:25.390 --> 14:28.791
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
ELSE THAT WE CAN DO...

14:28.900 --> 14:31.619
KEYS TO THE CAR ?

14:31.730 --> 14:35.336
OH, YEAH.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.973
YOU LOOK BUSY.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.674
IAM.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.645
I'M CONTEMPLATING.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.775
YOUR BUSY IS
SO DIFFERENT FROM MY BUSY.

14:48.880 --> 14:53.908
SO, WHAT'S NEXT
ON YOUR PACKED AGENDA ?

14:54.020 --> 14:56.250
PAPERS TO GRADE,

14:56.360 --> 14:58.180
YARD WORK,

14:58.290 --> 14:59.723
I SHOULD REALLY
FINISH THAT ARTICLE.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.092
THAT WAS NICE
OF YOU TO TALK WITH

15:01.200 --> 15:02.963
CLAIRE'S FRIEND
THIS MORNING.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.220
I GUESS THAT GOES ON
IN YOUR CLASSROOM ALL THE TIME.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.264
WHAT ?

15:07.370 --> 15:10.407
INTELLECTUAL DISCUSSIONS WITH
YOUNG WOMEN IN SKIMPY FASHIONS.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.708
WELL, THEY DO LOVE TO
CHALLENGE A FATHER FIGURE.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.869
BUT IF YOU THINK
THAT'S SKIMPY,

15:16.980 --> 15:19.039
YOU SHOULD SEE THEM
SUMMER QUARTER.

15:21.880 --> 15:26.112
( music )

15:32.690 --> 15:34.021
MY MAN.

15:34.130 --> 15:37.019
DAWG, WE'RE STILL
ON THE JOB.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.893
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.467
WHAT ARE YOU,
MY WIFE ?

15:40.570 --> 15:42.333
KISS MY ASS.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.659
WHIP IT OUT.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.476
HEY, THIS BOYFRIEND,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.332
YOU LOVE HIM ?

15:49.440 --> 15:50.668
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.668
IS HE SEXY ?

15:52.780 --> 15:53.917
MMM-HMM.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.169
YOU SEE THIS FAT GUY
RIGHT HERE ?

15:55.280 --> 15:57.840
DOES HE LOOK
CRAZY TO YOU ?

15:57.950 --> 15:59.941
THAT'S THE DJ,
THEY ALWAYS LOOK CRAZY.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.789
BIG DICK ?

16:01.890 --> 16:03.380
EXCUSE ME ?

16:03.490 --> 16:04.525
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.450
DOES HE HAVE
A BIG DICK ?

16:06.560 --> 16:07.857
IS THAT
WHAT YOU LIKE ?
JESUS CHRIST.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.121
ME, I GOT A BIG DICK.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.788
SOMETHING DON'T
HAPPEN TONIGHT,

16:11.900 --> 16:13.299
IT'S GONNA
BREAK RIGHT OFF.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.561
YOU KNOW YOU COULD
REALLY HELP ME OUT HERE,

16:15.670 --> 16:17.262
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.201
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING ?

16:19.310 --> 16:20.971
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.604
I'M NOT HELPING
YOU OUT.

16:22.710 --> 16:23.802
IT'S NOT COOL.

16:23.910 --> 16:25.446
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT ?

16:25.550 --> 16:27.711
JAVIER, I DON'T TREAT MY MAN
THE WAY YOU TREAT YOUR WOMAN.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.878
ALRIGHT ?

16:28.980 --> 16:30.186
YOU'RE LOADED.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.587
YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO YOUR ROOM.

16:31.690 --> 16:32.679
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M SEXY ?

16:32.790 --> 16:34.587
YOU SHOULD GO.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.578
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT MY DICK
BEFORE YOU SAY NO, MAN.

16:36.690 --> 16:39.989
GO, PLEASE.

17:11.660 --> 17:12.922
MMM-HMM.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.918

17:15.030 --> 17:17.464
YEP.
PHONE.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.668
NATE FISHER.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.032
( Brenda )
It's me.

17:24.140 --> 17:27.371
I THOUGHT LAST TIME
WAS OUR LAST LAST TIME.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.732
YEAH, AS FAR
AS SEX GOES.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.843
SO HEY,
I TOLD JOE.

17:32.950 --> 17:35.373
ABOUT ME ?

17:35.480 --> 17:37.619
WELL, I DIDN'T
NAME NAMES.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.142
BUT, YEAH.

17:39.250 --> 17:43.459
I WAS REALLY SCARED,
IT WAS REALLY HARD, BUT--

17:43.560 --> 17:44.720
Yeah, we're okay.

17:44.830 --> 17:48.322
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.762
So listen, come see

17:50.870 --> 17:52.724
Brenda, what--

17:52.830 --> 17:54.263
I KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID.

17:54.370 --> 17:55.860
BUT I CAN'T JUST SURGICALLY
REMOVE YOU FROM MY LIFE,

17:55.970 --> 17:57.528
IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.504
Come on.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.134
WELL, I'M SORRY,
I'VE GOT OTHER PLANS.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.935
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.268
NO, IT'S TRUE.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.677
WE'RE GOING
TO TRAVEL TOWN LATER.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.099
AREN'T WE,
MISS PUNKIN ?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.370

18:09.180 --> 18:10.886
CAN I COME

18:10.990 --> 18:13.117
I DON'T KNOW...

18:13.220 --> 18:16.257
NO ULTERIOR MOTIVES,
I JUST WANT TO RIDE THE RAILS.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.555
BRENDA, WE ALWAYS
HAVE ULTERIOR MOTIVES.

18:18.660 --> 18:19.729
No, we don't.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.650
We don't.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.558
Come on, please ?

18:55.330 --> 18:57.764
LIAR, LIAR, LIAR.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.964
WHAT KIND OF MAN SPENDS
THIS MUCH MONEY ON SOME CHICK

19:01.070 --> 19:02.890
WITHOUT GETTING LAID ?

19:09.610 --> 19:10.440
( phone ringing )

19:10.550 --> 19:11.847
HELLO ?

19:11.950 --> 19:13.372
Hey, what are
you doing ?

19:13.480 --> 19:15.971
I'M TRYING NOT TO EAT
THE KRISPY KREMES.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.310
Come over as soon
as you can.

19:18.420 --> 19:22.914
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT,
YOU SOUND BETTER.

19:23.020 --> 19:24.021
Yeah.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.859
I'M DONE CRYING.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.767
YOU READY, WHAT DO
YOU SAY, MAYA, HUH ?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.269
CABOOSE ?

19:33.370 --> 19:35.065
WANT TO GET

19:35.170 --> 19:36.865
AH-HA !

19:36.970 --> 19:38.130

19:38.240 --> 19:41.607
ISN'T THIS EXCITING ?

19:41.710 --> 19:43.132
( bell )

19:43.250 --> 19:44.205
( male )
ALL ABOARD !

19:44.310 --> 19:45.948
DESTINATION,
LAS VEGAS !

19:46.050 --> 19:47.574
LAS VEGAS ?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.079
WHOO !

19:49.180 --> 19:52.183
BYE !

19:58.730 --> 20:02.291
( soft music )

20:19.450 --> 20:22.647
MY GOODNESS,
WHAT'S ALL THIS ?

20:22.750 --> 20:23.489
NOTHING.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.512
IT'S JUST
SOME FLOWERS.

20:29.660 --> 20:30.922
WHAT'S UP ?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.749
THAT GIRL, ANITA...

20:33.860 --> 20:36.499
I THINK SHE SHOULD BE
CONTRIBUTING FINANCIALLY.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.864
WHY ?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.494
SHE'S HARDLY
EVER HERE,

20:40.600 --> 20:42.067
SHE BASICALLY
LIVES AT RUSSELL'S.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.637
YOUR RUSSELL ?

20:43.740 --> 20:45.105
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

20:45.210 --> 20:46.461
I DON'T CARE.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.539
STILL, I THINK SHE
SHOULD GIVE US A CHECK.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.245
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST ANITA ?

20:52.350 --> 20:54.238
I SIMPLY THINK
IF SHE'S GOING

20:54.350 --> 20:55.942
TO PRANCE AROUND THE HOUSE
IN HER UNDERWEAR,

20:56.050 --> 20:57.415
SHE SHOULD PAY
FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.044
MOM, I GUARANTEE YOU.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.414
NONE OF
MY FRIENDS PRANCE.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.779
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.892
WELL, DON'T BOOK
A FIVE A.M. RADIO THING

21:12.000 --> 21:14.195
AND THREE STUPID TV
TALK SHOWS BACK TO BACK...

21:14.300 --> 21:17.758
REMEMBER, I SIGN
YOUR FUCKING CHECKS !

21:18.940 --> 21:20.532
I'LL BE
IN FRONT.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.629
NO!

21:21.740 --> 21:24.004
OH, YOU THINK YOU
HAVE JOB SECURITY ?

21:24.110 --> 21:26.146
I FIRED MY OWN
GODDAMN PARENTS !

21:26.250 --> 21:28.639
UH, ASSHOLES !

21:28.750 --> 21:30.889
GREEDY, BLOODSUCKING
ASSHOLES.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.289
GIMME THAT.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.787
I THINK THERE MAY BE BETTER
WAYS TO HANDLE YOUR ANGER.

21:39.890 --> 21:42.154
YEAH, WELL, WHEN I CARE WHAT
YOU THINK, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.490
FINE.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.363
GOD.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.995
OH MY GOD !

21:49.100 --> 21:50.362
OH, THAT'S
YOUR PICTURE.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.768
I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING
TWO-DOLLAR HOOKER !

21:52.870 --> 21:54.531
I WAS SUPPOSED

21:54.640 --> 21:56.938
FUCKING STUPID
ASSHOLES !

21:57.040 --> 21:59.543
EVERY FUCKING TIME !

22:01.380 --> 22:02.870
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
ALRIGHT ?

22:02.980 --> 22:06.040
COME ON, NOW.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.888
BESIDES, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO LOOK LIKE A HOOKER ?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.529
I'M STARVING.

22:26.210 --> 22:27.632
OH, KEITH.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.571
OH MY GOD.

22:29.680 --> 22:35.368
OH, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.745
OH, MMM, MMM.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.488
WOULD YOU STOP
PLAYING GANG GIRL ?

22:40.590 --> 22:41.989
WE'RE ONLY
HERE TO TALK.

22:42.090 --> 22:43.216
YOU DON'T KNOW HER,

22:43.320 --> 22:44.480
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S GONNA DO.

22:44.590 --> 22:45.818
SHE COULD SCRATCH
THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR FACE,

22:45.930 --> 22:47.329
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO THE P.T.A. ?

22:47.430 --> 22:49.193
PLEASE, I WANT TO SEE
WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.927
WHATEVER.

22:51.030 --> 22:54.568
I'M TAKIN' OUT MY EARRINGS
AND I'M PUTTIN' AWAY MY GOLD.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.073
THAT'S HER.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.698
WHO ARE YOU ?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.495
I'M VANESSA,
I'M RICO'S WIFE.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.728
OKAY, THIS IS
NOT MY PROBLEM.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.695
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE HERE.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.131
IF YOU'RE
SLEEPING WITH RICO,

23:30.240 --> 23:31.366
I THINK IT IS
YOUR PROBLEM--

23:31.470 --> 23:32.801
NO, UH-UH.

23:32.910 --> 23:34.434
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRESS,

23:34.540 --> 23:36.132
AND YOU CAN'T
KEEP A MAN.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.174
WHAT ?!

23:38.280 --> 23:40.305
I'M NOT FINISHED

OH, SHIT.

24:59.860 --> 25:00.997

25:17.080 --> 25:19.469
YOU CAN HELP ME
PICK UP, IF YOU WANT.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.411
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.444
I CUT BACK
THE CRAPE MYRTLE.

25:24.550 --> 25:26.643
THIS IS NOT
A CRAPE MYRTLE.

25:26.750 --> 25:29.150
IT'S THE TREE NATHANIEL
PLANTED FOR CLAIRE

25:29.260 --> 25:30.727
ON HER 10th BIRTHDAY.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.628
CAN'T YOU TELL A CRAPE MYRTLE
FROM A BRADFORD FLOWERING PEAR ?

25:33.730 --> 25:37.769
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT LOOKED DISEASED.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.839
I'VE READ ABOUT POWDERY MILDEW
AND IT'S NO JOKE.

25:40.940 --> 25:45.365
THAT TREE IS NOT, NOR
HAS IT EVER BEEN DISEASED.

25:45.470 --> 25:47.199
IT NEVER GETS
POWDERY MILDEW,

25:47.310 --> 25:49.130
BECAUSE I ALWAYS KEEP
THE SOIL DRY AND AERATED.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.379
MY GOD,
YOU'VE KILLED IT.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.674
I HAVE NOT.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.816
ASK ANYONE, YOU HAVE
TO TRIM VEGETATION

25:54.920 --> 25:57.445
IN ORDER TO STIMULATE
NEW GROWTH.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.188
YOU'RE A GEOLOGIST,
YOU KNOW ROCKS.

25:59.290 --> 26:00.689
THIS IS
A LIVING THING.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.987
YOU CHOP OFF THE BRANCHES
AND YOU MAKE WOUNDS.

26:04.090 --> 26:08.424
RUTH, PLEASE, DON'T
ANTHROPOMORPHIZE TREES.

26:08.530 --> 26:10.691
WOUNDS, GEORGE,
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CALLED,

26:10.800 --> 26:12.358
AND THESE WOUNDS
WILL NOT HEAL.

26:12.470 --> 26:14.938
THEY'LL BE INVADED BY ROT AND
IT WILL MOVE INTO THE CORE WOOD.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.864
YOU'VE BUTCHERED THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL TREE IN MY YARD.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.377
I THINK IT'LL COME BACK

26:24.480 --> 26:26.300
BIGGER AND BETTER
THAN EVER.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.514
AND IF IT DOESN'T,

26:28.620 --> 26:31.839
WE CAN ALWAYS
GET ANOTHER ONE.

26:31.950 --> 26:35.681
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME
WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.819

26:44.930 --> 26:49.196

INSTEAD THEY'RE LIKE SANDALWOOD
LAVENDER VANILLA MUSK.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.071
COME HERE, STOP IT.

28:07.180 --> 28:10.069

28:25.100 --> 28:29.491

39:50.150 --> 39:52.448
YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIRAM ?

39:52.550 --> 39:54.450
I PRACTICALLY
LIVE HERE.

39:54.560 --> 39:59.020
I MADE A MISTAKE.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.189
I JUST WANT
TO TAKE IT ALL BACK.

40:01.290 --> 40:05.829
I KNOW, DEAR,
I KNOW.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.158
( phone ringing )

40:07.270 --> 40:08.828
YO.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.168
Hey.

40:10.270 --> 40:11.498
JUST THE MAN
I WANT TO TALK TO.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.759
WHAT'S UP, KEITH ?

40:12.870 --> 40:13.609
WHAT'S UP, DAWG.

40:13.710 --> 40:14.779
YOU HAVE
TO COME HOME.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.302
I am, the tour's
back on the west coast

40:16.410 --> 40:17.399
in a couple of weeks.

40:17.510 --> 40:18.704
LISTEN, I GOT
TO CHECK IN WITH--

40:18.810 --> 40:21.040
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME,
I NEED YOU NOW !

40:21.150 --> 40:24.608
David, the timing's
not good.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.483
FUCK TIMING,
FUCK YOU !

40:26.590 --> 40:28.581
WHOA, WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOU ?

40:28.690 --> 40:30.885
DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT
I'M LOSING MY FUCKING MIND ?

40:30.990 --> 40:32.059
CAN'T YOU TELL ?

40:32.160 --> 40:33.559
GOD, WHERE IS
EVERYBODY ?!

40:33.660 --> 40:35.855
Okay, okay,
I hear you.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.121
DON'T STAY ALONE,
GO TO YOUR FAMILY,

40:38.230 --> 40:40.528
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.502
* JESUS TAUGHT ME
HOW TO WATCH *

40:46.610 --> 40:49.135
* HE WASHED
MY SINS AWAY *

40:49.240 --> 40:51.105
* OH, HAPPY DAY

40:51.210 --> 40:53.371
* IT WAS A HAPPY DAY

40:53.480 --> 41:01.387
* HE TAUGHT ME HOW,
HOW TO WATCH *

41:01.490 --> 41:06.325
* FIGHT AND PRAY,
OH YES *

41:06.430 --> 41:09.194
* FIGHT AND PRAY, OH

41:09.300 --> 41:13.464
* OH, AND THEN REJOICE

41:13.570 --> 41:20.032
* EVERYDAY, EVERYDAY

41:20.140 --> 41:24.236
* OH YEAH

41:24.340 --> 41:31.143
* OH, HAPPY DAY,
OH, HAPPY DAY... *

41:31.250 --> 41:33.684
I THINK I'VE
FIGURED US OUT.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.189
ME, TOO.

41:35.290 --> 41:38.054
YOU FIRST.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.421
I THINK
YOU ARE THE...

41:43.530 --> 41:47.091
COOLEST AND MOST
BEAUTIFUL PERSON

41:47.200 --> 41:49.668
I'VE EVER
SEEN IN MY LIFE

41:49.770 --> 41:52.307
AND I ADMIRE YOU
SO FUCKING MUCH.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.298
WELL, OF COURSE.

41:54.410 --> 41:56.332
AND YOU ARE
TOTALLY HOT.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.237
I MEAN, I FEEL THAT,
I REALLY DO,

41:58.340 --> 42:00.240
AND I'M LIKE
SO PULLED TO YOU.

42:00.350 --> 42:03.911
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS
WHOLE THING OBJECTIVELY ?

42:04.020 --> 42:06.989
THE ATTRACTION
IS AESTHETIC.

42:07.090 --> 42:08.239
WELL, YEAH !

42:08.350 --> 42:10.409
IT'S CREATIVE
AND ARTISTIC--

42:10.520 --> 42:12.385
AND INTELLECTUAL
AND PHYSICAL--

42:12.490 --> 42:13.457
YES !

42:13.560 --> 42:17.326
BUT NOT
NECESSARILY SEXUAL.

42:17.430 --> 42:20.024
YOU'RE NOT INTO
FUCKING WOMEN.

42:20.130 --> 42:22.530
I THOUGHT I WAS.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.802
SHIT.

42:26.910 --> 42:28.673
SHIT.

42:30.940 --> 42:33.374
BUT Al-TER SEEING
YOUR ORGASM ?

42:33.480 --> 42:36.972
I REALLY,
REALLY WANT ONE.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.849
FUCK !

42:41.420 --> 42:43.650
CHOO, CHOO.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.455
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
PLACE, BREN.

42:45.560 --> 42:46.857
IT'S PEACEFUL.

42:46.960 --> 42:50.418
YOU AND JOE
DID GOOD.

42:50.530 --> 42:53.397
COULD'VE BEEN US.

42:53.500 --> 42:58.665
YEAH, BUT
IT'S NOT US.

42:58.770 --> 43:01.534
AND IT'S TIME
FOR MAYA'S NAP.

43:01.640 --> 43:05.201
RIGHT, TIME FOR A NAP.

43:05.310 --> 43:06.299
WE'VE GOT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

43:06.410 --> 43:08.549
LET HER SLEEP
ON THE BED.

43:08.650 --> 43:11.687
COME ON, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT SAFE THINGS.

43:11.790 --> 43:15.214
CHUGGA CHUGGA
CHUGGA CHUGGA...

43:18.160 --> 43:19.752
( Maya laughing )

43:32.210 --> 43:34.462
I'M GOING OUT FOR
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

43:34.570 --> 43:37.368
OKAY, BYE.

43:37.480 --> 43:42.713
ALL YOU DO
IS COME AND GO !

43:46.350 --> 43:47.578
RUTH.

43:47.690 --> 43:50.454
MARRIAGE IS NOT
A GAS STATION, GEORGE.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.050
YOU CAN'T JUST
PULL IN AND FILL UP

43:52.160 --> 43:53.650
WHENEVER YOU REMEMBER
YOU HAVE A WIFE.

43:53.760 --> 43:59.289
THAT IS COMPLETELY
UNFAIR AND INACCURATE.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.961
I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED YOU
AS A PARTNER AND A FRIEND,

44:03.070 --> 44:06.301
AND IF THAT'S NOT MARRIAGE,
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.878
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU DON'T !

44:08.980 --> 44:10.800
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR OWN LIFE ?

44:10.910 --> 44:13.447
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE CENTER
OF EVERYTHING FOR YOU ?

44:13.550 --> 44:16.474
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HOUND ME
ABOUT EVERY PERSONAL DETAIL

44:16.580 --> 44:19.287
DOWN TO THE FUCKING
SUBATOMIC LEVEL ?

44:19.390 --> 44:21.278
BECAUSE WHEN I DON'T,
THERE'S SHIT ON MY DOORSTEP,

44:21.390 --> 44:23.551
OR ANOTHER CHILD APPEARS,
OR ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND,

44:23.660 --> 44:26.788
OR YOU MURDER
MY FAVORITE TREE !

44:26.890 --> 44:28.118
SARAH WAS WRONG.

44:28.230 --> 44:29.959
YOU'RE NOT LIKE NATHANIEL,
YOU'RE WORSE !

44:32.200 --> 44:33.599
YOU ARE SMOTHERING ME.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.167
BULLSHIT !

44:35.270 --> 44:37.636
YOU ALWAYS DO
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.

44:37.740 --> 44:40.607
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED OR
GROWN ONE IOTA SINCE WE MET.

44:40.710 --> 44:46.342
WELL, DON'T SAY
I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

44:46.450 --> 44:47.849
WARN ME ?

44:47.950 --> 44:50.316
ARE YOU
THREATENING DIVORCE ?

44:50.420 --> 44:51.785
THAT IS NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

44:51.890 --> 44:54.484
I'M YOUR SEVENTH
SPOUSE, GEORGE.

44:54.590 --> 44:57.115
HOW MUCH WARNING
DO YOU THINK I NEED !

45:01.290 --> 45:02.951
( door closing )

45:05.830 --> 45:07.525
YOU JUMPED ON HIM ?

45:07.630 --> 45:09.689
I COULDN'T
STOP MYSELF.

45:09.800 --> 45:11.665
WHAT DID HE DO ?

45:11.770 --> 45:13.761
PUT ME DOWN
AND SAT ON ME.

45:13.870 --> 45:15.474
I WAS LIKE
A MOSQUITO TO HIM.

45:15.580 --> 45:16.877
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

45:16.980 --> 45:20.609
I HAVE TO GET
CONTROL OF MYSELF.

45:20.710 --> 45:23.315
NO, DAVID, IF YOU WERE
ANYMORE CONTROLLED,

45:23.420 --> 45:25.445
YOU'D BE A SCULPTURE.

45:30.690 --> 45:32.453
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

45:32.560 --> 45:34.994
LAST NIGHT,

45:35.100 --> 45:39.525
I HAD A HUMILIATING HOMOSEXUAL
EXPERIENCE OF MY OWN.

45:39.630 --> 45:42.337
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

45:42.440 --> 45:44.089
NOT MUCH.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.804
I NEVER EVEN
WENT DOWN ON HER.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.059
YOU CAN STOP THERE.

45:47.170 --> 45:49.138
I JUST COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.673
IT PISSES ME OFF.

45:50.780 --> 45:55.240
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH
EASIER TO BE GAY.

45:55.350 --> 45:56.715
OH, NO.

45:56.820 --> 45:58.674
YEAH, I'D HAVE A REALLY
DEFINED SUBCULTURE.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.439
OVERRATED.

46:00.550 --> 46:02.051
WE'RE BOTH WOMEN,

46:02.160 --> 46:03.809
I'D HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT
SHE WAS THINKING AND FEELING.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.150
NOT NECESSARILY.

46:06.260 --> 46:09.696
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH UNFAMILIAR SEX ORGANS.

46:09.800 --> 46:13.099
OH, THEY'RE ALL UNFAMILIAR,
UNLESS THEY'RE YOURS.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.266
( door opening )

46:23.340 --> 46:24.739
HEY.

46:24.850 --> 46:25.999
HOW YOU DOING ?

46:26.110 --> 46:30.513
I GOTTA LEAVE
THE TOUR, DUANE.

46:30.620 --> 46:32.485
YEAH, I HEARD.

46:32.590 --> 46:36.253
TH ERE'LL STILL
BE WORK IN LA. ?

46:36.360 --> 46:37.759
DEFINITELY, YEAH.

46:37.860 --> 46:39.657
WE KNOW IT'S
NOT YOUR FAULT.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.954
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ?

46:41.060 --> 46:47.363
YEAH, I'LL GO
TELL CELESTE.

46:47.470 --> 46:48.596
WHOA.

46:48.700 --> 46:50.031
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT TOLD .

46:50.140 --> 46:52.802
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

46:52.910 --> 46:54.605
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

46:54.710 --> 46:57.178
CELESTE FIRED
YOUR ASS THIS MORNING.

46:59.980 --> 47:02.949
( moaning )

47:09.690 --> 47:10.816
JOE--

47:10.920 --> 47:12.922
OH GOD, FUCK.

47:13.030 --> 47:14.725
WAIT, WAIT, MAYA'S--

47:17.800 --> 47:22.931
LOOK, I DESERVE WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO SAY TO ME,

47:23.040 --> 47:25.065
BUT I DON'T WANT
HER SCARED, SO...

47:25.170 --> 47:27.229
CAN YOU
GIVE ME THAT ?

47:27.340 --> 47:29.035
GET OUT.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.238
OH GOD.

47:38.250 --> 47:39.547
OH.

47:45.930 --> 47:48.057
I GOT YOUR BEAR.

47:53.730 --> 47:54.867
IT'S HIM.

47:54.970 --> 47:57.029
YOUR PREVIOUS
INDISCRETION, HIM ?

47:57.140 --> 47:58.698
YES.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.404
THAT DEPRESSING
CRIPPLE ?

48:00.510 --> 48:03.809
I MEAN, YOU'RE BOTH
CRIPPLES, OBVIOUSLY.

48:03.910 --> 48:07.073
I'M SO STUPID.

48:07.180 --> 48:09.273
YEAH, I WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERING
HAVING CHILDREN WITH YOU.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.644
BUT THAT TRULY
FRIGHTENS ME !

48:11.750 --> 48:12.944
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

48:13.050 --> 48:15.951
I KNOW IT'S
NOT MY FAULT.

48:20.230 --> 48:22.095
I'VE OBVIOUSLY
BEEN IN COMPLETE DENIAL

48:22.200 --> 48:23.690
THAT I'M IN RECOVERY.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.222
OH, SHUT THE FUCK UP !

48:25.330 --> 48:29.869
YOU NEUROTIC, TEDIOUS,
SELF-ABSORBED BITCH.

48:29.970 --> 48:32.666
YOU DON'T GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT ME.

48:32.770 --> 48:34.658
YOU NEVER DID.

48:34.770 --> 48:36.431
IT'S NOT TRUE.

48:36.540 --> 48:37.507
I LOVE YOU, JOE.

48:37.610 --> 48:38.702
IDO!

48:38.810 --> 48:41.404
I WAS HONEST WITH YOU
IN THE BEGINNING.

48:41.510 --> 48:42.738
I HAVE AN ISSUE--

48:42.850 --> 48:45.717
OH, BLAH-BLAH FUCKIN'
PSYCHO-BULLSHIT !

48:45.820 --> 48:48.084
IT'S NOT SEX,
IT'S BETRAYAL,

48:48.190 --> 48:49.714
THAT'S YOUR
FUCKING ADDICTION !

48:49.820 --> 48:51.412
OKAY,
I'LL GET HELP.

48:51.520 --> 48:54.182
NO, NO, HERE'S
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

48:54.290 --> 48:56.349
WHAT DO YOU CALL A PERSON
WITHOUT CHARACTER,

48:56.460 --> 48:58.690
WITHOUT INTEGRITY,
WITHOUT LOYALTY,

48:58.800 --> 49:00.267
WITHOUT RESPECT ?

49:00.370 --> 49:04.136
I CALL THAT PERSON
A FUCKIN' WASTE OF MY TIME.

49:04.240 --> 49:07.038
THAT'S NOT
WHO I AM.

49:07.140 --> 49:10.007
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME,
BUT YOU DON'T.

49:31.830 --> 49:33.058
YOU'D THINK SOMEONE
IN THIS FAMILY

49:33.170 --> 49:36.139
WOULD NOTICE WHEN
THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE.

49:46.850 --> 49:48.306
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

49:48.410 --> 49:50.219
YOU GO TO BED WITH A WOMAN WHILE
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S RECOVERING ?

49:50.320 --> 49:51.947
I CAN'T TRUST
A MAN LIKE THAT.

49:52.050 --> 49:53.483
CELESTE...

49:53.590 --> 49:55.581
LOOK, IF YOU STAYED WITH
THE TOUR YOU'D DISTRACT ME.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.055
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.684
PLUS IT'S VERY UNPROFESSIONAL
TO FUCK THE BOSS.

49:58.790 --> 50:00.758
NOT COOL, DAWG.

50:00.860 --> 50:02.896
WELL, JUST
SO YOU KNOW,

50:03.000 --> 50:04.524
I WAS LEAVING
BEFORE YOU FIRED ME.

50:04.630 --> 50:07.121
HMM, SYNCHRONICITY.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.768
CIAO, BABY !

50:18.740 --> 50:20.378
"Dear neighbor...

50:21.710 --> 50:24.042
( laughing )

50:25.290 --> 50:27.042
"You are my brother...

50:27.150 --> 50:29.584
"I love you...

50:29.690 --> 50:36.823
"and yet I feel a great
sadness in my bosom...

50:36.930 --> 50:38.727
WHERE'S MOM ?

50:49.480 --> 50:50.799
"GOING AWAY.

50:50.910 --> 50:52.343
"DON'T CONTACT
THE AUTHORITIES.

50:52.450 --> 50:55.613
"I'LL BE IN TOUCH
WHEN I'M READY.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.073
DINNER IS
IN THE OVEN."

50:57.180 --> 51:01.048
APPARENTLY
SHE'S GONE WALK-ABOUT.

51:03.060 --> 51:08.748
( laughing )

51:14.900 --> 51:17.789
( Marge Simpson )
I wish this family was
as close as the Flanders.

51:17.900 --> 51:20.960
( Homer Simpson )
Okay, okay, alright,
she's right.

51:21.070 --> 51:22.708
Let's do
something together.

51:22.810 --> 51:25.142
What does eryone say
to some miniature golf,

51:25.250 --> 51:28.299
followed by a round of
frosty chocolate milkshakes ?

51:28.410 --> 51:29.946
( Bart Simpson )
Alright !

51:30.050 --> 51:32.848
( Marge Simpson )
I was going to wash my hair.

51:38.660 --> 51:42.050
* OH HAPPY DAY,
OH HAPPY DAY *

51:42.160 --> 51:46.392
* OH HAPPY DAY,
OH HAPPY DAY *

51:46.500 --> 51:50.766
* WHEN JESUS WASHED,
WHEN HE WASHED *

51:50.870 --> 51:52.428
* HE WASHED
MY SINS AWAY *

51:52.540 --> 51:59.139
* OH HAPPY DAY,
OH IT'S HAPPY DAY *

51:59.250 --> 52:03.846
* HE TAUGHT ME HOW

52:03.950 --> 52:06.680
* HE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO WATCH *

52:06.790 --> 52:15.949
* HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO WATCH
AND FIGHT AND PRAY *

52:16.060 --> 52:21.692
* OH HAPPY DAY,
OH HAPPY DAY, OH LORD *

52:21.800 --> 52:25.167
* OH HAPPY DAY,
OH YEAH *

52:25.270 --> 52:26.908
* OH HAPPY DAY
