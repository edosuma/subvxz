03:18.000 --> 03:20.500
I found this necklace by the tree.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.000
Okay.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.500
OFFICER MILLER: You found the body, Mrs Clark.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.000
Yes.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
And you knew the dead girl, is that right Chloe?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Yes, that’s right. I spoke to her a few times.

03:33.000 --> 03:33.500
OFFICER MILLER: Where?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.250
Out here.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.500
What was she doing?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.250
She said she was communing.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.000
She said the countryside was her church.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
She was really nice.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.500
Did she tell you her name?

03:41.500 --> 03:42.250
Sarah!

03:42.250 --> 03:43.000
MILLER: Just Sarah?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.500
That’s all she said.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
Is that all?

03:45.500 --> 03:46.500
Yes, thank you.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
SUTTON: Dave!

04:33.200 --> 04:34.000
Mike!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
What have we got?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.500
Female, aged about 21.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.500
Been dead for less than 24 hours.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.000
People at the house found her this morning.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
The land here used to be a small farm.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
It's pretty wild now.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We found her necklace over by the tree.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.500
Looks like the body was moved from there to here.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.500
Any clues to the cause of death?

04:56.500 --> 04:58.250
Only this.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.000
What else?

05:07.700 --> 05:10.300
More severe burning across the inner thighs and abdomen.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.500
Pathology’s not goIng to find anything.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.000
My thoughts exactly.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.500
Same as the others.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.500
You okay?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.000
Come here. Come here.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Panic attack?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Okay, okay. You know what to do.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Breathe in quickly.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Out slowly.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Breathe in quickly.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Out slowly.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.500
Did you take your beta blocker?

07:31.500 --> 07:32.000
Okay.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Do you want a Diazepam?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
No, they make me drowsy in the morning.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay, okay, it’s all right.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
That’s it.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Come on, lie down.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Feeling better?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Was it a bad dream?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
No. Just woke, and there it was.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Like ants under my skin

08:01.000 --> 08:03.500
and this growing sense like I’m gonna die.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.800
Shhhh!

08:04.800 --> 08:05.800
You’re okay.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You’re okay now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.500
Maybe you should go and see a doctor.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
No point.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.000
But you were so much better before…

08:24.000 --> 08:26.500
...before Sarah died.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.000
I know.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
But that was a year ago and since then

08:31.000 --> 08:32.500
you’ve been having these attacks again.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
I know!

08:33.500 --> 08:34.550
I just want you to be -

08:34.550 --> 08:35.500
Normal?

08:35.500 --> 08:37.000
Better.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I will be...

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
...if I can just know what happened to Sarah.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
If the police had solved her murder…

08:43.000 --> 08:44.300
But there’s nothing you can do about it now.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.500
There is.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.000
There might be.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Oh, you’re not talking about that spirit medium thing.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.500
Leah recommended her.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.500
It’s all bullshit.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.000
You don’t know that.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Anyway...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
...I’ll be late home after work.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.100
REBECCA: Sarah?

09:13.500 --> 09:14.750
Sarah?

09:15.100 --> 09:17.200
There’s one here who loves you.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.000
REBECCA: Your sister.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.500
Your twin, Emma.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.000
Come closer.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
REBECCA: Closer.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.000
Sarah’s here.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.500
Speak to her.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.500
Sarah!

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
Are you at peace?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.000
She is.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.500
But she wants you to be at peace too.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.000
I try, Sarah, but...!

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
I miss you so much. I just want to know...

09:53.000 --> 09:54.500
...what happened!

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Sarah, I know you’re tired. Can’t you stay a little longer?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.500
Sarah!

10:03.500 --> 10:05.000
Sarah!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.800
It was a good beginning.

10:09.800 --> 10:10.900
Can't you bring her back?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.000
It's too soon.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
We can’t know the energy it takes

10:14.000 --> 10:15.750
for those who have passed through the veil

10:15.750 --> 10:17.500
to look back through it.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.000
And it takes its toll me on me, too.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
We’ll try again.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Tomorrow?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I can’t tomorrow. I have another reading.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I can only manage one a day.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Next week.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
How much do I owe?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Nothing.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Hi Tess.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.500
I was just wondering if Emma was home yet.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.000
Er, no, she’s not back yet.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.500
I tried calling her.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.000
She’s probably driving.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Yes, I’m just wondering...

12:11.000 --> 12:12.900
...have you heard how it went?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.000
Leave him alone...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I’ve no idea.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.300
...and wait till Emma calls.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.500
Can you get her to ring me?

12:18.500 --> 12:19.200
Okay.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.200
Okay. Bye.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.800
Hi mum. I was driving.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.700
Oh, you’re not driving now, are you?

12:38.700 --> 12:41.000
No mum. I just got here.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Well? How did it go?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Nothing much happened.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So something happened.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
I’m a bit washed out. I'll call you.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.500
Call me tomorrow -

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
Well, it would help if you cared.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.000
Do you want a drink?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.750
No, you’re all right.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.500
Mum called.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.000
Called me too.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
She wanted to know - you know.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.500
Yeah!

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
Well, don’t you want to know?

14:00.500 --> 14:03.000
What I want is for you to move on.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
You and your mum.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.500
Well, that's all I want. That's why I'm -

14:05.500 --> 14:07.000
Paying someone to tell you what you want to hear.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.500
She wouldn't take my money.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.750
She will.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.500
I'm going to bed

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Emma, I’m sorry.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.500
You’ve got to let me do this.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.000
I just worry that this is something

14:20.000 --> 14:21.500
that’s going to give you false information,

14:21.500 --> 14:22.500
you know, false hope.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.500
If it’s false then all I’ve lost is one evening,

14:24.500 --> 14:26.000
maybe two of my life.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
If not...

14:28.000 --> 14:30.500
...at last I’ll find out who killed Sarah.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.000
I just wish the police had done their job.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Then let me do what I can.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I’m so sorry.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I just...

14:45.000 --> 14:47.800
Sometimes I just feel like I don’t know what to do for you.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.000
I know.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I know it’s not easy for you dealing with the anxiety

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
and the attacks.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.500
Sometimes I feel guilty for letting you take all this on

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
when we got together.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.500
No. I knew what I was doing.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
Okay, I didn’t know anything about panic attacks

15:05.500 --> 15:07.500
but you told me you had them

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
and I fancied you so much that...

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
that didn’t matter.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.500
And then I fell for you and…

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
...here we are.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I hope you're in the mood.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
Emma?

16:56.500 --> 16:59.000
Sarah!

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
He was...he was killing her.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
No, it was just a dream.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.500
I saw her die.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.000
No, you're just having a panic attack.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.500
His hands around her neck...

17:05.500 --> 17:06.500
...the detective.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.500
Well that just proves it was just a dream.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.000
I think she was trying to show me.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.500
Okay, just breathe in quickly...

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
...out slowly.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.000
It wasn't a panic attack. It was...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Okay, okay, just lie down. Just lie down. You're fine.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.250
Okay...okay...

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
It's all right, It's fine,

17:35.000 --> 17:35.500
SAM - Coffee?

17:35.500 --> 17:36.000
Mmmm.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Look -

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I know what you’re going to say so don't.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Okay, but can I say it anyway?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.300
Why don’t we go away? Anywhere you fancy.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.000
Oh!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I thought you were going to tell me not to see Rebecca again.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.700
Well, we haven’t had a holiday in like over a year.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.850
I don’t know if I can get the time off.

17:57.850 --> 17:58.500
Ask.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.800
What about you?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.000
Won’t be a problem.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Okay.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.500
Okay.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
So, how’d it go?

20:03.500 --> 20:04.200
What?

20:04.200 --> 20:05.000
With Rebecca.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.500
Christ, Leah, let me get a coffee first.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You really need decaf.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.200
What’s the point?

20:17.200 --> 20:18.100
Caffeine’s bad for you.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.200
You don’t drink decaf.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.000
I’m insensitive.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
So, what happened with Rebecca?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.300
I don’t think I’m going to see her again.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.500
What?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.000
Sam thinks…

21:06.000 --> 21:09.500
No, actually I think I need to move on.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
So you’ll do what Sam says.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.000
It’s causing problems.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Life is full of fucking problems.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.800
Maybe he’s right.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.000
He’s fucking wrong.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.500
You want to know who murdered your sister,

21:19.500 --> 21:22.000
and the police know fuck all.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.500
I don’t know.

21:25.000 --> 21:25.500
JESS: Morning.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.000
Morning.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.500
Mail!

21:31.500 --> 21:34.000
You’ve just not been yourself lately.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I don’t know what myself is.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.500
I’m talking about the panic attacks.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.000
I had them before. I thought they’d stopped.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You never said.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Did you get treatment?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.500
I saw a psychologist.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.000
Did it help?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.500
He taught me relaxation and gave me cognitive therapy.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.000
Well, whatever that is, it clearly didn’t work.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.500
Look at the state of you now.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.000
Yeah, I know. I’m a basket case!

21:59.500 --> 22:03.000
It stopped but…since Sarah, it’s come back.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.500
You’re telling me.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.000
Somedays when you come in it's like

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
you’ve fought a battle between the car park and here.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
The first time I thought you were going to actually fucking die

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and that gave me a panic attack.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
That for you is just panic.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
A real panic attack is…

22:18.000 --> 22:23.100
You’re anxious and you’ve got this feeling of worry all the time.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.500
Like when you take your driving test,

22:26.500 --> 22:29.000
or you’re in the waiting room of the dentist

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
and your stomach feels scrambled,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
and it’s like that.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.500
And you feel worried, but you’re not actually

22:36.500 --> 22:39.000
but you don’t know why you feel like that anyway.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
And then when you're doing whatever you’re doing

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
whether it’s watching telly or walking,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
you get this feeling

22:47.000 --> 22:49.500
and it gets worse and it spreads all through your body,

22:49.500 --> 22:51.000
and you heart is pounding

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
and your breath gets hard and you feel like…

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
...like you’re going to die.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So what do you do?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
I find time to do relaxation every day.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It helps but…

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
...since Sarah...

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
...it never went away. I just managed it...but...

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
...now I can't.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.750
Hey, come on.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.000
Sometimes I feel like I’m the one that should have died.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Sarah and I were identical in every way.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Things that made us laugh,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
the food we ate,

23:28.000 --> 23:29.500
but not our clothes though,

23:29.500 --> 23:31.000
or our hair.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
She had something I didn’t have, and I had something she didn’t have.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.750
What do you mean?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.880
She had what my dad had -

23:40.880 --> 23:45.000
the ability not to worry, to not let things get to him.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.750
Sarah was the sea of calm.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.500
Me? I took after my mum.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.000
She’s anxious. She can get herself into such a state,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
and that’s her gift to me, only with me it was worse -

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
has been since I was thirteen.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
A few years ago I got treatment but…

24:03.000 --> 24:05.500
...now it’s come back.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.500
So you need closure.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.000
Yes, I do.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
See, that is where I think Rebecca can help.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
Look, I know...when I first went I thought it was a load of shite,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.500
but my friend made me go and I never regretted it.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.000
My mum had just died and...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.500
...I just needed to know she wasn’t...

24:26.500 --> 24:28.250
...gone forever.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.000
I mean, it took a couple of sessions, but...

24:30.000 --> 24:31.500
...I got what I needed.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.500
Do you think Rebecca’s the real deal?

24:34.500 --> 24:37.500
If I didn’t believe in her, I wouldn’t have asked her to see you.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.500
She doesn’t see just anyone.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.300
She needs to...

24:41.300 --> 24:44.000
She needs to believe in what you want.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
And I guess she’s not interested in people being just curious.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So you must see her again.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.500
Does she take any money?

24:51.500 --> 24:55.000
No, she doesn’t do it for the money. She’s got a day job.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.750
She does it because she can.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.500
Hello, Human Resources, how can I…

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
Oh, hi!

25:03.500 --> 25:06.000
Yep! Just a minute.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
His master’s voice.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Who?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.500
Sam!

25:12.500 --> 25:13.000
Hi!

25:13.000 --> 25:15.250
Oh, I meant to tell you, I’ve got an exhibition

25:15.250 --> 25:17.500
in Liverpool, Tuesday next week,

25:17.500 --> 25:19.500
SAM: so I need to stay overnight.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.300
Oh!

25:20.300 --> 25:23.000
I know you can’t be on your own but I bet Joanna will stay with you.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.500
Yeah, Jo’s good like that.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.000
Have a girls' night.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Yeah, I will.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.500
Okay, see you later.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.000
Yeah, love you.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.500
Girls' night next Tuesday?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.500
Tuesday?

25:37.500 --> 25:39.300
Bollocks! I got the step-mum invading.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
It’s so nice to get you out for lunch.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.500
Are you okay?

25:46.500 --> 25:47.200
Yeah!

25:47.200 --> 25:49.000
You still taking those meds?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
No, I don’t like the way they make me feel.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.300
Seriously, Emma, how do you cope?

25:54.300 --> 25:58.000
I kind of exchange one sensation for another.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.100
Okay, let’s go.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.400
So…this sensation!

26:02.400 --> 26:04.150
Sex!

26:04.150 --> 26:05.500
Oh! Okay! Yep!

26:05.500 --> 26:06.800
That’ll do the trick.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.000
It does.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Well, I can think of worse things to do.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.800
So, is that something you like discovered

26:12.800 --> 26:14.000
in the middle of a panic attack?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.500
It’s before it gets to that.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.500
It’s when I feel more anxious than usual

26:17.500 --> 26:19.750
but it’s something that’s always worked for me.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.500
Sex, I mean!

26:21.500 --> 26:23.000
So you’re a nymphomaniac.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
No!

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Let's just say I have a pretty healthy libido.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
You just like it a lot.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.200
A lot!

26:29.200 --> 26:31.000
Well, most days!

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Lucky Sam!

26:33.000 --> 26:35.500
I think it’s all a bit too much for him really.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.000
But I can’t think of a more powerful sensation

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
so it helps when I feel more anxious than usual.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
An orgasm a day! Yes, please!

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Sshhh!

26:45.000 --> 26:46.800
It’s not like that.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.000
What then?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.200
The cuddling.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.300
It's when he strokes my head and kisses my face.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.500
I find that more relaxing than just about anything.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.200
And then there’s the intimacy. The closeness.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.000
The feeling of his hand on my head and neck.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
That makes me less anxious

27:01.000 --> 27:03.700
and then usually it leads to….!

27:03.700 --> 27:06.700
I can see why he doesn’t want you to get better then.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.250
Sorry, insensitive!

27:08.250 --> 27:11.500
It’s all right, I don't usually tell people this.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.500
So, does Sam know, like, why he's getting sex every day?

27:15.500 --> 27:18.000
Oh yeah, the funny thing is he’s happy just to hold me

27:18.000 --> 27:21.300
and caress me. I’m the one who takes it further.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.800
Okay, I think I underestimated Sam.

27:23.800 --> 27:24.500
Sounds like a decent bloke.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.000
He is.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
He must also be really knackered!

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
SAM: Anything on telly?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.080
No, nothing any good on.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh, do you want another?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
No! Had enough. Too easy!

27:53.000 --> 27:54.500
So…!

27:54.500 --> 27:55.800
What?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.000
The spirit medium thing.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I’m gonna give it another try.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.000
Look…

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I think if I'm gonna get better I need closure.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.900
I know, and I understand how you feel.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.000
No you don’t.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
You don’t know what it’s like to lose a sister,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
to know that she was murdered, and you don’t know who by.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.500
And you miss her so much

28:20.500 --> 28:22.000
you just wanna walk in a room and see her

28:22.000 --> 28:23.300
and when she’s not there

28:23.300 --> 28:26.000
it hits you like a punch in the stomach.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.100
And you know you’re life will never be the same

28:29.100 --> 28:32.000
because one of the most joyful things,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.500
one of the most precious things in life has been taken,

28:35.500 --> 28:37.000
and I need to know how

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
so don’t tell me not to do everything I can.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
What, now?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I want to.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.000
Is this what the weekend’s gonna be like?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.350
Oh no!

29:23.350 --> 29:25.500
It’s gonna be much filthier.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And how was the dirty weekend?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Dirty!

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Details.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.700
You could’t handle it.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.000
Oh, I can!

31:30.000 --> 31:31.500
I really can!

31:31.500 --> 31:32.800
I need to know!

31:32.800 --> 31:34.500
I've got to know!

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
Keeley’s not getting enough of her own.

31:36.500 --> 31:39.000
i haven’t got the time. NHS would grind to a halt.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.300
Supernurse.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.800
Ta-da-da-daaaa!

31:41.800 --> 31:44.800
Here to save the day with my big hypodermic!

31:44.800 --> 31:45.700
Boasting again.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.600
Thank God for nurses like you.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.500
Let’s not forget about the little people…

31:49.500 --> 31:51.000
...like Jo.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.440
Excuse me! If it wasn’t for the little people like me,

31:54.440 --> 31:57.500
the people like you would have to do all their own checkouts.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.000
Oh, that would be terrible, having to scan your own shopping.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.200
But I ike it when Jo does it for me instead of going to it

32:03.200 --> 32:05.000
and it saying, 'Call for assistance.'

32:05.000 --> 32:08.100
I mean, what’s the point if you have to have someone do it for you?

32:08.100 --> 32:10.000
See!

32:10.000 --> 32:12.100
Oh, do that again.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
That look’s terrible.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
High fever,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
rapid pulse.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.500
I prescribe lots of sex and another glass of wine.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.000
The wine works for me.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Darling, you really have to lose your cherry some time.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.500
Oi, who says I haven’t?

32:27.500 --> 32:29.100
Well, you never say anything about getting any….

32:29.100 --> 32:30.500
...wahay!

32:30.500 --> 32:33.300
'Wahay'? Who says ‘Wahay'?

32:33.300 --> 32:35.200
Just being polite.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.500
You’re only polite when your gob’s shut.

32:37.500 --> 32:41.000
Keeley, tell us one of your nursie stories.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.500
Oh, I love those.

32:42.500 --> 32:45.000
Oh, okay!

32:45.000 --> 32:48.160
Oh, do you know what a tracheotomy is?

32:48.160 --> 32:50.000
No.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.800
Okay, well, when someone's airway is blocked

32:52.800 --> 32:55.300
you make an incision in their trachea.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.300
Their what-ier?

32:57.300 --> 32:58.100
Their windpipe.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.500
I knew that.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.500
Yeah, right!

33:00.500 --> 33:01.600
I did!

33:01.600 --> 33:05.300
So, you make a hole in their windpipe so that the patient can breath.

33:05.300 --> 33:08.000
Now the trouble is that sometimes it can get stuck

33:08.000 --> 33:09.100
with lots of mucus and gunk...

33:09.100 --> 33:10.100
Ewww!

33:10.100 --> 33:11.900
and that needs suctioning out.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
You make good sucking noises.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
She gets a lot of practise.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Oi! Carry on Keeley.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
So, to do this you take this long piece of tubing

33:21.000 --> 33:23.400
with a suction pump at one end,

33:23.400 --> 33:25.900
and at the other this piece of kit called a yankauer.

33:25.900 --> 33:26.500
A what?

33:26.500 --> 33:28.700
A yankauer!

33:28.700 --> 33:31.900
So, I was on nightshift, and it was 3 AM in the morning.

33:31.900 --> 33:34.000
It was nice and quiet and peaceful

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
when this man, who had just had a tracheostomy,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.500
started gurgling and struggling to breathe.

33:39.500 --> 33:43.000
So Jenny, the staff nurse, went right over to him

33:43.000 --> 33:44.900
and said in a really loud voice,

33:44.900 --> 33:47.000
‘Would like me to yanker you?’

33:49.000 --> 33:51.700
The man’s eyes nearly popped out.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.500
I bet that wasn’t the only thing.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.000
I was eating a sandwich at the time

33:55.000 --> 33:57.800
and laughing so much I nearly choked.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.400
You needed yankering!

33:59.400 --> 34:00.500
Nearly!

34:10.000 --> 34:13.500
It must be weird with all those men in bed letching at you.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.900
You think? Get this!

34:15.900 --> 34:18.310
So, I was taking handover from day shift

34:18.310 --> 34:21.200
from this very handsome male nurse named Dan.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.300
And I’m talking hot!

34:23.300 --> 34:25.000
And I mean hot!

34:25.000 --> 34:26.500
He's really hot!

34:26.500 --> 34:30.300
So, he was giving me details abut this 20-year-old female patient

34:30.300 --> 34:33.600
who was laying in bed and she was gazing up adoringly.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.300
And I was like, oh yeah,

34:35.300 --> 34:38.500
she's having some amazing fantasies about hot Dad.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.000
And then later on I go through some routine stuff with her,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
and I say, 'How are you feeling?'

34:43.000 --> 34:45.800
And she goes, ‘I am gagging for sex.’

34:45.800 --> 34:51.600
And I was like, Oh, okay! Well, hey ho! I can’t help you there!

34:51.600 --> 34:54.000
So I was like, 'Oh it must have been really difficult for you

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
having hot Dan looking after you,'

34:56.000 --> 34:57.300
and she goes,

34:57.300 --> 35:01.000
'I didn’t mean him. I’m gay. I meant you!'

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
And I was like, Oh my God!

35:04.700 --> 35:06.160
You must have run a mile.

35:06.160 --> 35:09.300
Not really. She was kind of cute.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.000
Yeah, but you’re not gay.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Not gay, no, but...one time....

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
...like Katy Perry said,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
and I kinda liked it.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.300
God!

35:26.300 --> 35:29.500
Honestly, Jo, you’re such a weeny sometimes.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.000
I tell you, with some of the things I have to deal with,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
kissing a girl is no big thing.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Blood! Shit!

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Sick! Death!

35:38.500 --> 35:40.500
Can I ask you something?

35:40.500 --> 35:43.200
Sure?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.400
You’ve seen people die.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, i've been right by their side when they went.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.500
What happens? Do you see anything?

35:52.500 --> 35:54.400
Feel anything?

35:54.400 --> 35:59.000
No, but, you know they’re not there any more.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
One thing I do, which is a personal thing -

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
I open a window.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.900
Sort of let the spirit out.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.500
So you think there is a spirit?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.300
I’d like to think there is.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.000
And I want to help it out on its way.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
And if you didn’t open the window would the spirit remain,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.100
like a ghost?

36:16.100 --> 36:19.000
I have no idea,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.400
but maybe that’s what a ghost is -

36:21.400 --> 36:24.050
a spirit that hasn’t gone to where it needs to go.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.000
Right! Let’s talk about what scares us the most.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Okay, you first.

36:31.000 --> 36:31.800
Spiders!

36:31.800 --> 36:33.160
Is that all?

36:33.160 --> 36:35.000
Well, what scares you then?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Well, nothing really.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Nothing scares you! Makes you jump!

36:39.000 --> 36:42.400
Oh, well, okay, well, I don’t like people making me jump.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.900
I hate it.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.000
When I was a kid I freaked out

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
when I was in my bedroom

36:47.000 --> 36:51.200
and my brother jumped into the doorway and yelled ‘BOO!’

36:51.200 --> 36:54.160
I kid you not, I took off, leaping into the air

36:54.160 --> 36:56.800
and landing onto the bed in tears.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.000
He thought he was hilarious, of course.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.300
So come on Emma, what about you?

37:03.300 --> 37:05.300
Er, I dunno!

37:05.300 --> 37:07.800
Well, there must be something. What about when you were a kid?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.800
All kids are scared of something.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Erm…!

37:12.000 --> 37:13.200
My dressing gown!

37:15.160 --> 37:15.800
What?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.000
Your dressing gown?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Er…I’d be lying in bed

37:22.000 --> 37:26.900
and it would be hanging on the bedroom door, and...

37:26.900 --> 37:28.800
...in the dark and...

37:28.800 --> 37:30.800
it looked like it changed shape,

37:30.800 --> 37:34.800
and I’d hide under the covers until I fell asleep.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.800
You’re just a couple of wussies.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.700
I need to pee.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
You know where it is.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That was quick.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.500
Yeah, I -

38:06.500 --> 38:08.000
I just remembered...

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I needed...get home -

38:09.000 --> 38:10.700
Yeah!

38:10.700 --> 38:11.100
Sorry!

38:11.100 --> 38:12.200
Will you be okay?

38:12.200 --> 38:14.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just - just -

38:14.900 --> 38:16.000
- short walk.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.200
Bye!

38:25.000 --> 38:26.900
That was all a bit sudden.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.000
Yeah, maybe she left the gas on or something.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.500
Funny girl!

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
You sure you don’t mind staying over?

38:33.500 --> 38:36.000
Of course not.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Helps knowing someone’s here.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.900
Cute PJs.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.000
Thanks.

40:26.000 --> 40:26.900
Night then.

40:26.900 --> 40:27.900
Night!

43:01.000 --> 43:02.500
Emma?

43:02.500 --> 43:03.650
Sorry…erm -

43:03.650 --> 43:05.000
Bad dreams.

43:05.750 --> 43:06.750
Come here.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.000
EMMA: I’m so sorry!

43:12.500 --> 43:15.000
What can I do?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.500
Sam strokes my head.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
Oh, I am so sorry.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.400
It’s okay.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.600
I am so embarrassed.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.200
It’s just -

43:38.200 --> 43:39.100
JO: It’s okay, really.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.000
I mean, if you want to get in, we can just -

43:41.000 --> 43:42.900
No, I'm not sure either -

43:42.900 --> 43:44.200
- if that would help.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.000
Oh God! Erm -

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
I feel so much better. I’ll just go back to my room.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I’m sorry, Jo.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Oh, I helped myself.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.600
I’ll be off as soon as I‘ve finished. I don’t want to be late.

44:14.600 --> 44:15.600
Okay.

44:18.500 --> 44:21.000
I can get you some coffee, if you’d like.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
No, thanks.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.500
I’m sorry about last night.

44:25.500 --> 44:26.500
It’s okay.

44:26.500 --> 44:30.000
When I get a panic attack, I just…I can’t…

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
It’s okay. That’s what I was here for.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.400
Although I’d not seen you have one before.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.600
Glad you were here, thanks.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.000
When Sam’s away I find it hard to -

44:42.200 --> 44:46.000
Any time. I have to rush. Call me if you need me.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Thanks Jo.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.300
I can see her...but...

47:18.300 --> 47:19.500
I can’t see her face.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.700
All this medium stuff, it’s messing with your mind.

47:22.700 --> 47:24.500
But...what if it's -

47:24.500 --> 47:27.000
It’s all in your mind.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.500
Then I need to find out.

47:39.100 --> 47:41.000
I need your help.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.000
Hi, come in.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.400
I hope you don’t mind me bringing Leah with me.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.000
I wouldn’t have found you otherwise.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.900
Funny thing for a psychic to say.

47:58.900 --> 48:02.600
Oh, I’m not a psychic, I think of myself more as a conduit.

48:02.600 --> 48:05.900
Without a satnav, I keep telling her, she needs to get one.

48:05.900 --> 48:08.900
Oh I didn’t mean it like that, I wasn’t meant to be funny.

48:08.900 --> 48:11.100
It’s okay. Leah convinced me to come.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.700
I’m grateful.

48:12.700 --> 48:14.200
Just as long as you're aware,

48:14.200 --> 48:16.000
I’m not like that woman from Polstergeist.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.300
I don’t normally do home visits.

48:18.300 --> 48:22.000
My gift is more about being able to let the spirits into my home.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.800
But tell me what’s happened.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.900
I feel a presence.

48:25.900 --> 48:28.500
Okay. Can I have a look around?

48:28.500 --> 48:29.200
Feel free.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.100
Shall I make coffee or...

48:31.100 --> 48:34.500
No, stay where you are. Let’s see what I can sense.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.150
Sarah stayed in this room.

49:19.150 --> 49:21.000
Yes sometimes.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
She liked it here with you. It was fun.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Is she here?

49:27.000 --> 49:28.900
Yes.

49:28.900 --> 49:30.200
Can I see her?

49:30.200 --> 49:33.900
She’s been trying to show…

49:51.000 --> 49:51.500
Sarah!

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
She’ll stay over like she used to,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
and you’ll see her every now and then.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.000
Sarah’s here.

50:55.700 --> 50:58.880
Emma, you look so different.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.100
I feel different.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.300
I’ve never felt so calm, no anxiety at all.

51:04.300 --> 51:06.100
It’s Sarah making you feel like that.

51:06.100 --> 51:08.000
Can she do that?

51:08.000 --> 51:11.700
Sarah’s a spirit. The spirit’s much stronger than the physical.

51:11.700 --> 51:13.550
I believe the spirit possesses a purity

51:13.550 --> 51:15.700
that we can’t even begin to imagine until

51:15.700 --> 51:17.500
we, too, are spirits.

51:17.500 --> 51:21.800
And all the pain and anxiety of the physical body has gone.

51:21.800 --> 51:25.420
I think Sarah shared some of her spirit with you.

51:29.000 --> 51:29.900
SAM - What’s going on?

51:29.900 --> 51:32.400
Something amazing has happened.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.000
Yeah?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
We’ll be going.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
See you in the morning, yeah?

51:44.500 --> 51:46.600
Sarah’s here.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.300
She came to visit.

51:49.300 --> 51:50.000
Emma -

51:50.000 --> 51:52.100
She made me feel completely calm,

51:52.100 --> 51:54.600
like I have so anxiety whatsoever.

51:55.100 --> 51:58.100
Well, if you’re going to be well again…

51:58.100 --> 52:02.000
I know I’m going to be much, much better.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.500
Well, that’s all I want.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.000
Okay?

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Perfectly okay. Goodnight.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.700
So it’s all good.

52:36.700 --> 52:38.000
Yeah!

52:38.000 --> 52:39.600
And what about -

52:39.600 --> 52:40.000
What?

52:40.000 --> 52:41.500
The sex!

52:41.500 --> 52:42.300
Don’t feel the need.

52:42.300 --> 52:45.000
So what happened to horny Emma?

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
I don’t know. I feel like I have something more.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.800
So no more dirty weekends?

52:50.800 --> 52:52.000
Who needs them?

52:52.000 --> 52:53.500
I fuckin’ do.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.600
EMMA: What’s this?

53:21.600 --> 53:28.000
LEAH: The Empire. It shows films and live shows.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
LEAH: Let’s go one evening.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
EMMA: You and me?

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
LEAH: Yeah, girls' night out.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
EMMA: Yeah, okay!

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
TESS: Richard, why are you so hesitant?

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
I'm not, I just -

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Don’t believe.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
I can’t believe in something I haven’t seen.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
What about God? You can’t see Him.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
I stopped being in God when he let our daughter die.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Mum!

54:11.500 --> 54:15.000
I’ve not seen you look so happy before.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Dad!

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
So!

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Come with me.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Dad?

54:30.800 --> 54:35.000
You two go up.

54:49.250 --> 54:51.000
Have you seen her?

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
No.

55:05.300 --> 55:06.200
Sarah!

55:09.000 --> 55:10.250
Mum’s here!

55:13.500 --> 55:15.000
Can’t you feel her spirit here?

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Maybe another time.

55:32.450 --> 55:33.450
Sarah?

55:36.700 --> 55:40.900
I don’t think she can hear the way we understand, so...

55:40.900 --> 55:42.900
…just love her.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I do!

56:06.300 --> 56:07.450
Richard...

56:07.450 --> 56:09.000
...I saw her.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
You can see here too. Just go up.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
What’s the point?

56:13.000 --> 56:14.300
She’s not coming home.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Give him time.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Sarah!

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Sarah, can you show me you’re here?

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
Oh, Sarah!

57:19.000 --> 57:22.200
It’s beyond wonderful to see you.

57:22.200 --> 57:25.000
You’ve changed my life.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
It’s been so hard since you left me,

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
but I feel so much better knowing your spirit lives on.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
But Sarah,

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
there’s something that’s a hard question to ask and...

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
...I need an answer.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Can you tell me…

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
...can you find a way to tell me who killed you?

57:56.800 --> 57:57.900
Wait!

57:59.000 --> 58:00.500
No, come back.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
Yeah yeah yeah - great, I’ll send that...I’ll sort it soon as -

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Yeah!

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
Right, okay, great! Bye!

58:42.900 --> 58:45.000
Pick up, Emma.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.470
Answer your fuckin’ phone.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.100
Emma!

59:11.250 --> 59:12.350
Emma!

59:13.450 --> 59:15.000
Come on, wake up.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
You all right?

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
What time is it?

59:17.000 --> 59:18.900
Almost six.

59:18.900 --> 59:20.000
It’s still early.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.600
In the evening!

59:35.200 --> 59:36.200
Morning, Sleepy!

59:37.700 --> 59:38.100
Morning!

59:40.800 --> 59:43.000
Come on, up you get coz I’m off to work.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.500
Okay!

59:44.500 --> 59:45.000
Yeah?

59:45.000 --> 59:45.500
Mmm.

59:45.500 --> 59:46.000
Okay!

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:09.600
I’ve brought you some tea, sir.

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:13.700
I have to go and see a young woman in the morning.

1:00:13.700 --> 1:00:15.850
I want you to come with me.

1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:18.000
Why don’t you have a regular partner, sir?

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000
What do you see here?

1:00:25.500 --> 1:00:27.000
Their throats are all burnt.

1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:28.500
Conclusion?

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:29.500
Serial killer?

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.100
SUTTON: If it’s a serial killer

1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:45.000
he’s been killing for over a hundred and sixty years.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.000
What happened?

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.000
My back!

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.000
Let me see!

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000
Uh…!

1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:14.000
I always knew having a nurse for a friend would come in handy.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.200
Well, it’s better dressing than what Emma did.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:20.550
Well, that’s why you’re a nurse and I work in human resources!

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:24.500
We're going to see Emma West.

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:26.700
Her twin sister was murdered a year ago.

1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:28.900
Her throat burned.

1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:30.000
And other parts.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.900
Take notes. Don’t speak.

1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:37.100
KEELEY: You seem…

1:02:37.100 --> 1:02:39.000
...different.

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000
Yeah! I’m doing great.

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000
Okay, well, I’ll see you later.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000
Bye.

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:46.000
See Ya.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.100
Bye.

1:03:05.150 --> 1:03:06.300
Don’t be late for work.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.100
Miss West? Do you remember me?

1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:18.800
I know this sound weird but have you seen me...

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:21.600
...in a place where you wouldn’t expect to see me?

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:23.500
Yes.

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:25.900
Where?

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.100
In a dream.

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:29.300
In a dream!

1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:32.000
I saw Sarah being killed…

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:33.500
...by you.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.500
Do you know why you would dream that?

1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:41.900
I thought maybe Sarah was trying to show me how she was killed,

1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:43.500
but it was just an anxiety dream.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:46.000
I’ve been much better since I saw Sarah.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.000
In your dream?

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:51.000
No. She’s here. Her spirit! I see her.

1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:55.000
I’ll come back.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.000
You have your notes?

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000
Yes, sir.

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.100
Tear them up. You’ll never need them.

1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:10.200
MILLER: Shit!

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:14.000
That’s why I don’t have a regular partner!

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.500
Emma!

1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:54.800
Yeah?

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.000
Wasn't sure if you were asleep.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000
Not sure of anything.

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000
Just doing my relaxation.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000
I thought you were relaxed enough.

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.800
I am. I was.

1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:10.000
Is there something you want to tell me?

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.900
The other night I saw Sarah, and she kissed me

1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:14.100
and I asked her to tell me who murdered her

1:07:14.100 --> 1:07:15.600
and I think she will.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.500
I don't know, it's like you're worse, you're different.

1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:21.000
It's like you've got some sort of insanity.

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.500
I don’t know what you expect.

1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:24.000
How about some fucking honesty?

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000
When have I not been open and honest with you?

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000
All those looks between you and Keeley.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.500
What? What looks?

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:33.000
The sort of looks that tell me you two know something I don’t.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.500
Well, maybe you don’t need to know.

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:37.000
Well, call me paranoid but if Keeley was a guy

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000
I might be fucking jealous.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.100
You know what, Sam?

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:43.300
Whatever I did in the past really has nothing to do with you.

1:07:43.300 --> 1:07:44.250
Yeah, well…

1:07:44.250 --> 1:07:47.000
I never took you for a dyke.

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.900
First of all, I’m not gay.

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.500
And if I was, what the fuck has it got to do with you?

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:55.500
Except for the fact that I wouldn’t be fucking you in the first place.

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:58.400
But, yeah, Keeley and I played around when we were younger,

1:07:58.400 --> 1:08:00.000
exploring how we felt. What’s the harm in that?

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.500
I mean you didn’t have to do, like...

1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:04.000
...anything.

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:07.400
What we did or didn’t do has nothing to do with you.

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:11.400
Just like what you did in the past has nothing to do with me.

1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:14.000
And who are to be judgemental, anyway?

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.600
You who used to smoke dope and peddle drugs

1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:18.900
and rob old ladies to pay for your habit.

1:08:18.900 --> 1:08:20.100
That’s not the same.

1:08:20.100 --> 1:08:24.000
No! I wasn’t hurting anyone.

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:28.600
Look…

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:31.000
...you’ve done amazing to change your life around,

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.500
but you had something to change. I didn’t.

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:36.700
I’m still the same person.

1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:38.400
It’s like I don’t know who you are.

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:41.000
Surely you’re not insecure.

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.500
You know what? I can’t be dealing within this.

1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:44.300
I’m going to bed…in the spare room.

1:08:44.300 --> 1:08:45.200
That’s Sarah’s room.

1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:48.000
Yeah, well Sarah can move out, or I will.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000
I’ve brought someone.

1:11:15.100 --> 1:11:16.300
Emma?

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000
Could I have a drink?

1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.500
Erm…tea?

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:23.700
Do you have any brandy? Scotch?

1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:25.400
We have water.

1:11:25.400 --> 1:11:26.450
Is it bottled?

1:11:26.450 --> 1:11:27.000
No.

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.500
Well, thank you but no. I never drink water from the tap.

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.300
Neither would you you if you knew what went into it.

1:11:32.300 --> 1:11:35.000
Excuse me, but who exactly are you?

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.200
My name’s Susan Brooke.

1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:38.600
I’m a parapsychologist.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:40.500
What’s this about?

1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:43.000
Emma, this morning you told me you saw me,

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.100
or what looked like me, killing your sister.

1:11:45.100 --> 1:11:47.000
This morning?

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.500
He came by the house.

1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:51.000
What? You never said.

1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:52.000
Argue later.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.200
Emma, have you sought out your sister’s spirit in any way?

1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.300
I went to see a medium.

1:11:58.300 --> 1:12:03.000
And then you started seeing your sister here in your home.

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.500
What you’ve been seeing is not your sister.

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.000
I believe that there are dark forces

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.800
that can appear in many different forms.

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:16.900
Sometimes we see them as those who’ve died.

1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:17.700
Ghosts!

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:18.900
But why?

1:12:18.900 --> 1:12:20.900
To delude us. To cheat us.

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:24.800
To make us think that what is evil is really good.

1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:26.000
I don’t accept that.

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.500
What I’m telling you now you must accept.

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:30.900
Why must I?

1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:34.400
Because there is a dark force intent on destroying you.

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:36.050
What is this dark force?

1:12:36.050 --> 1:12:39.500
It lurks in a kind of spiritual darkness.

1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:43.000
It can’t exist in our world without a vessel,

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.900
so it attaches itself to someone.

1:12:45.900 --> 1:12:48.000
It can infiltrate our thoughts…

1:12:48.900 --> 1:12:50.450
our dreams…

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000
but most importantly,

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.500
it can imitate the dead...

1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000
And the living.

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.700
It will take on a physical form

1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:10.000
so that it can achieve its darkest desire

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000
and will bring itself to a sense of depraved fulfilment

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:20.000
that it just can’t achieve in its own dark spirit world.

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.800
And this attacked Emma tonight?

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:22.840
It attacked you?

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:26.600
I thought it was Sam.

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.000
It made my neck sore.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.540
Emma, you remember that your sister

1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:44.000
was found with severe burning around her throat?

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.900
What we never made public was that

1:13:45.900 --> 1:13:48.500
she was the fourth girl found dead with these burns.

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.500
SUSAN: It generates heats that intensifies

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:56.000
SUSAN: and it leaves its victims with terrible burns.

1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:00.000
But leaves no forensic evidence. No DNA. No fluids.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:03.500
The only thing I know for sure is that Cain appears as me.

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:04.900
Cain?

1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.600
That’s the name I chose for it.

1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.000
Why Cain?

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.400
Because Cain was the first murderer.

1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:12.000
In the Bible.

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.900
It’s the name that came to mind when I saw it

1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:15.600
standing over Sarah’s body,

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:17.800
and I knew what it was.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:21.000
But why does it look like you, and how can we tell which is which?

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.700
I don’t know how to answer that except that I knew it,

1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:26.500
and it knew me.

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:30.000
Like twins.

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:34.400
What’s important here, Emma, is that it found you during a seance.

1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:35.900
And I brought it home.

1:14:35.900 --> 1:14:37.500
And it won’t leave until -

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:38.500
I’m dead.

1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:42.000
Which is why we’re getting out of here now.

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000
Wherever you go, it will go with you.

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.350
You have to defeat it here.

1:14:46.350 --> 1:14:48.000
How do we do that?

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.800
I think perhaps when it realises you know what it is

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.800
it might just leave you.

1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:55.600
You think it might?

1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:57.600
I know, it’s not an exact science,

1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:59.600
but I do have one suggestion

1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:03.400
that might help you defend yourself against it. Salt!

1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:04.100
Salt?

1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:09.000
I’ve read in some old texts that it’s a kind of barrier against evil,

1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.700
perhaps because it has some come kind of pure quality to it.

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:14.300
You read in old texts?

1:15:14.300 --> 1:15:17.100
You don’t have a shred of evidence for any of this, do you?

1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:21.700
In the Bible it says, 'You are the salt of the earth.'

1:15:21.700 --> 1:15:24.600
Even in the Bible there are indications.

1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:28.500
'Regard them not that are familiar spirits.'

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:32.700
And what about you? You who can see this evil.

1:15:32.700 --> 1:15:35.200
Perhaps by some kind of providence,

1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:38.400
there are those among us who are here to help us...

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:41.200
...to warn us.

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.000
An angel?

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:48.000
I prefer to think that he’s someone with a special gift.

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.450
Or curse!

1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:01.000
In my job you tend to prefer something stronger than tea.

1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:09.800
Do you believe any of that?

1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:11.800
Yeah!

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:14.000
Wait here.

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.500
We might need some more. I’m going to go and get some.

1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:22.300
Don’t leave me here.

1:16:22.300 --> 1:16:25.450
You’re right. Come with me.

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:13.000
He’s messing with our minds.

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.900
SAM: Where is this?

1:17:28.900 --> 1:17:32.600
I mean, there’s no walls, there’s no roof.

1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:34.550
We’re standing on something.

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:37.900
Emma!

1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:40.400
Emma, Help me!

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:54.500
Help me!

1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:58.250
Please! Emma!

1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.000
Give it to me.

1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:18.550
Hope that mad woman knows what she’s talking about.

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.500
I know who you are!

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000
TESS: What on earth’s going on?

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.000
Mum!

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000
We have to get inside the circle.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000
Circle?

1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:40.000
Ow! Mum! Mum!

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.600
You’re hurting me.

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.000
What the fuck did you do that for?

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:07.900
It’s Keeley!

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:09.900
Come on.

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:14.940
We’ve got to stay inside the circle.

1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:16.100
Yeah, it doesn’t like salt.

1:20:16.100 --> 1:20:17.300
What doesn’t?

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:19.000
The demon…thing!

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.930
It killed Sarah.

1:20:20.930 --> 1:20:23.000
And now it wants Emma.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.800
Well, it’s not getting you.

1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:25.840
What?

1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:30.000
Keeley!

1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:34.200
Love you, Emma.

1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:16.000
It’s not real.

1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:17.700
It’s an illusion.

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:19.100
I know you and you know me.

1:23:19.500 --> 1:23:21.000
I was on fire.

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.300
And the room, it...it...wasn’t here.

1:23:24.300 --> 1:23:27.000
An hallucination. Cain’s tricks.

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000
Let’s get you all to a hospital.

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.300
What just happened? Why’d you come back?

1:23:52.300 --> 1:23:55.350
Because I suddenly knew that Cain wanted to take you

1:23:55.350 --> 1:23:57.000
to whatever hell he came from.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.100
So what does that make you?

1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:02.000
That’s a question that’s been worrying me.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.200
You loved the countryside so much

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:08.800
and I know it’s where I can be with you Sarah, but…

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:12.580
it’s taken these past two years for me to be able to do this.

1:25:13.700 --> 1:25:16.000
Mum still visits your grave.

1:25:18.500 --> 1:25:19.900
Sam is doing well.

1:25:21.300 --> 1:25:24.700
His scars are fading faster than his surgeon expected.

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:28.500
All of our scars are fading

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.900
and we’ve put what happened behind us

1:25:31.900 --> 1:25:34.800
because there’s no other direction to go but forward.

1:25:38.900 --> 1:25:41.150
I've changed my way of thinking and...

1:25:41.150 --> 1:25:43.600
...I meditate.

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:45.700
And though it’s not been easy,

1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:48.000
you’ve always said that I was stronger than most people you knew

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000
because I had to be,

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.300
and which is why…

1:25:52.300 --> 1:25:56.600
I’ve finally been able to come out here on my own, ta daaaaa!

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:01.000
But now I believe in angels.

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.100
But not the way mum does.

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:09.000
You’re my angel, Sarah,

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:15.200
and whatever Inspector Sutton is or how he knew what he knew,

1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:18.000
it really was you, I do believe.

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000
And I’ve come to understand that poem that you loved so much

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.500
and which I knew you wanted to be read at your funeral but....

1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:26.500
...you know her!

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.900
Which is why I’m going to say it for you today.

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.600
Not because you’re gone.

1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:37.300
Because you’re here.

1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:43.800
Do not stand at my grave and weep.

1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:45.300
I'm not there.

1:26:45.300 --> 1:26:48.500
I did not sleep.

1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:52.000
I’m a thousand winds that blow.

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.000
I’m diamond glints on snow.

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:59.000
I am the sunlight on rippened grain.

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000
I’m the gentle autumn rain.

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000
When you awaken in the morning's hush

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.500
I'm the swift uplifting rush

1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:12.000
Of quiet birds in circled flight.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.000
I am the soft silent stars that shine at night.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:20.000
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.600
I’m not there.

1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:23.900
I did not die.
