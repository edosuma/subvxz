00:19.941 --> 00:24.332
During the 12 days before Christmas 1921...

00:24.501 --> 00:29.780
missing children from the city of
Belgrave in the forest nearby.

00:29.941 --> 00:33.013
They never heard of them again
and they were never found.

00:33.181 --> 00:36.093
Except for a traumatized girl.

00:36.261 --> 00:38.331
Her injuries were horrendous.

00:38.501 --> 00:40.537
Her mind was gone.

00:40.701 --> 00:43.056
She talked in riddles.

00:43.221 --> 00:45.974
Before she died of her
catastrophic injuries...

00:46.141 --> 00:52.137
one could only understand
her persistent shouting:

00:52.301 --> 00:54.815
"The witch, the witch."

00:55.701 --> 00:59.694
Just before Christmas,
in the winter of 1992...

00:59.861 --> 01:03.012
children started to
disappear again.

01:03.181 --> 01:05.489
This time it was five.

01:05.661 --> 01:07.891
They were found in the same forest.

01:08.061 --> 01:10.336
Their throat was cut.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.219
Their bodies were left behind.

01:12.381 --> 01:14.531
Some were buried.

01:14.701 --> 01:19.331
The people of the village have never
processed these brutal attacks.

01:19.501 --> 01:24.894
But they hoped that the perpetrator of these
terrible crimes, whoever or whatever...

01:25.061 --> 01:26.414
had disappeared.

01:26.581 --> 01:29.618
And the past 25 years...

01:29.781 --> 01:32.341
they could live in peace.

01:32.501 --> 01:34.537
Until now.

01:57.221 --> 01:58.621
Mom?

02:19.181 --> 02:23.538
There are different ways,
rituals that we will study.

03:14.501 --> 03:15.901
Who are you?

03:22.581 --> 03:24.697
Do you have more sweets?

04:04.741 --> 04:07.335
Guys, come on.
It is the last day before the holiday.

04:08.901 --> 04:10.971
Do I have to read this aloud?

04:12.261 --> 04:14.821
Do you find this funny, Kevin?
- Read for, teacher.

04:14.981 --> 04:16.619
Please, do not.

04:23.621 --> 04:25.373
GOALS FOR TODAY

04:25.541 --> 04:28.533
Hi, sorry I'm disturbing.
Amy, your mother is there.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.532
So you are free for the rest of the day.

04:41.461 --> 04:44.339
Amy, wait a minute.

04:46.381 --> 04:50.977
Callum.
- Listen, I wanted to ask you...

04:52.781 --> 04:54.737
whether you are my...

04:55.701 --> 04:57.817
Want to be a girlfriend?

04:57.981 --> 05:01.212
I have always found
you the perfect pair.

05:01.381 --> 05:04.054
The two losers of the school.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.530
Why do losers always like each other?

05:06.701 --> 05:10.057
Do not say that.
- And what are you going to do about it, tough guy?

05:10.221 --> 05:11.621
I do not want to fight you.

05:14.741 --> 05:16.379
Leave her alone.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.091
Guys, stop.

05:22.261 --> 05:25.253
I really did not want to do this,
but you can both stay after.

05:26.301 --> 05:28.610
Amy, go outside.
Your mother is waiting for you.

05:28.781 --> 05:30.181
Come with me.

05:43.421 --> 05:45.616
Mom, I've seen it.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.180
I know, I'm sorry.
It was just...

05:52.341 --> 05:54.297
I really stopped, promised.

05:54.461 --> 05:57.578
You promised it.
- I know that.

05:57.741 --> 06:01.780
And I keep my promises, okay?

06:07.461 --> 06:12.740
So, you know that as always we
go to Grandpa at Christmas.

06:12.901 --> 06:17.258
We're going to be two of us this year.
Daddy is not going.

06:18.221 --> 06:20.655
He does not think he can come.

06:20.821 --> 06:24.575
But it will be fun, because
we are cozy with three of us.

06:25.741 --> 06:28.016
But why does Daddy not come?

06:28.181 --> 06:31.093
He's just very busy
at the moment.

06:32.821 --> 06:34.174
But we can go better...

06:34.341 --> 06:36.650
because Grandpa is waiting for you.

06:36.821 --> 06:38.493
Good, put your belt on.

07:14.341 --> 07:15.741
ON THE WAY

07:50.741 --> 07:53.209
Hello Grandpa.

08:02.141 --> 08:03.541
Come on.

08:04.261 --> 08:06.172
Drink this nicely.

08:06.341 --> 08:08.901
Dad, exactly what I needed.

08:21.221 --> 08:22.893
Take off your jacket.

08:24.741 --> 08:27.175
She certainly did not take it well?

08:29.021 --> 08:31.774
I have not told her yet.

08:31.941 --> 08:34.296
How should I tell her that
just before Christmas...

08:34.461 --> 08:38.010
her father tells me that he
spends with another woman?

08:38.181 --> 08:40.820
Do you know that woman?

08:40.981 --> 08:44.940
He used to teach her, apparently,
so who knows who she is.

08:45.101 --> 08:47.615
You have to tell her.
- I know, Dad.

08:50.461 --> 08:52.531
It's just hard.
I mean...

08:53.701 --> 08:55.851
how did you do it?

08:56.021 --> 09:00.060
When Mom left you, how
did you keep going?

09:03.861 --> 09:05.692
Life was...

09:05.861 --> 09:07.772
then very different.

09:09.461 --> 09:13.170
That your mother took her
stuff and left that way...

09:14.981 --> 09:16.937
actually made it...

09:17.101 --> 09:19.899
easier for me to deal with.

09:20.061 --> 09:23.133
I did not have to see where
she was going or with whom.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.850
But is not it much worse
if you do not know?

09:27.021 --> 09:29.137
That you just never know?

09:29.301 --> 09:32.532
Wildon is not allowed to do
Amy what Mom did to me...

09:32.701 --> 09:35.454
grow up with only one parent.

09:35.621 --> 09:39.853
You were great porridge,
but you know what I mean.

09:40.021 --> 09:43.855
I can only say that
I am there for you.

09:44.021 --> 09:46.899
And I am always there for
you when you need me.

09:47.061 --> 09:49.973
And you can stay here
as long as necessary.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.332
Did you hear about that?

09:58.501 --> 10:00.731
Heard it on the radio this morning.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.735
Local boy is missing.
- Who would do something so terrible?

10:09.581 --> 10:12.334
Amy, I really do not think
it's going to work out.

10:13.301 --> 10:16.611
Your mother has made it quite
clear that I am not welcome.

10:16.781 --> 10:20.820
She says she wants you to come.
She just does not dare to ask.

10:20.981 --> 10:24.496
Whatever is going on, do
not let Christmas ruin it.

10:24.661 --> 10:27.334
I just want to celebrate
Christmas with my father.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.935
Wildon, come to bed.
- Who is that?

10:30.101 --> 10:32.137
Okay, I'm coming.

10:32.301 --> 10:34.178
I'll be there for dinner tomorrow.

10:47.181 --> 10:50.491
Hey girl, why are you here?

10:50.661 --> 10:52.652
I just wanted to be alone.

10:52.821 --> 10:57.099
Why do not you come out? Maybe Santa
has already brought presents.

10:57.261 --> 11:01.493
Santa Claus does not exist.
- How did these gifts end up here?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.061
Come on.

11:12.661 --> 11:14.538
Alfie...

11:14.701 --> 11:17.579
What are you doing here?

11:17.741 --> 11:19.333
I need to talk to you.

11:25.021 --> 11:27.330
Vanessa, this is an old friend of mine.

11:27.501 --> 11:30.459
Hi, do you feel like eating?

11:30.621 --> 11:33.294
No, she can not stay.

11:33.461 --> 11:35.691
It does not take long, this way.

11:41.221 --> 11:44.930
Who is that woman?
- I have no idea.

11:45.101 --> 11:47.057
Why are you back, Lesley?

11:47.221 --> 11:49.496
You do not belong here anymore.

11:49.661 --> 11:51.572
What we had is a thing of the past.

11:51.741 --> 11:53.618
Do not be so dramatic, Alfie.

11:53.781 --> 11:57.899
Perry Artwood is missing.
He is the fourth child that has disappeared.

11:58.061 --> 12:00.894
So?
- You know very well what this means.

12:01.061 --> 12:05.498
Not so hard. This has nothing
to do with what happened.

12:05.661 --> 12:09.734
Alfie, do not pretend
you do not know this.

12:09.901 --> 12:12.779
We are both involved.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.377
And it is time to
face our demons.

12:21.021 --> 12:26.334
This is of course not your big present.
And I know you wanted a real cat.

12:26.501 --> 12:29.777
But I just thought...

12:29.941 --> 12:33.616
given everything that is going on between
me and your father at this moment...

12:33.781 --> 12:36.170
that this might be a
good second choice.

12:36.341 --> 12:39.253
But next year it will
be different, better.

12:39.421 --> 12:44.290
And then you will get a
beautiful kitten, promised.

12:45.501 --> 12:49.050
It does not matter.
I did not expect a real cat.

12:49.221 --> 12:53.294
What I really wanted was
that porridge would be here.

12:53.461 --> 12:54.861
I know.

12:55.741 --> 12:59.654
She's back and whether
we like it or not...

12:59.821 --> 13:02.381
we are in danger.
They are in danger.

13:02.541 --> 13:05.135
The curse really exists.
- You imagine things.

13:06.781 --> 13:09.295
It happened then.
It was during that Christmas.

13:09.461 --> 13:11.975
Then it started and
now she is back.

13:12.141 --> 13:14.701
And you can not
imagine her powers.

13:15.621 --> 13:20.456
These children, Alfie.
These children are missing.

13:20.621 --> 13:23.260
Molly is back, risen from the dead?

13:23.421 --> 13:26.697
I know I have not seen you in a
while, but, Jesus, Lesley...

13:26.861 --> 13:28.897
you really need help.

13:32.581 --> 13:35.095
She cursed us, Alfie.

13:35.261 --> 13:40.858
She promised that in the coming years
we would receive our earned wages.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.933
And now it happens.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.017
Come to church tomorrow.

13:49.181 --> 13:51.854
Those who are still
left will be there.

13:52.941 --> 13:55.580
We must put an end to
this once and for all.

13:55.741 --> 13:58.096
Please go away, I do not want
to hear anything anymore.

13:58.261 --> 14:01.571
I did not mean to disturb you, Alfie.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.255
The priest said I had to come.

14:05.461 --> 14:08.453
And tomorrow everything will fall into place.

14:10.701 --> 14:15.980
Alfie, I'll stay here
until this is over.

14:16.141 --> 14:19.770
And after that you will hear
nothing from me anymore.

14:20.781 --> 14:22.658
Like we agreed.

14:30.301 --> 14:34.135
LIEVE SANTA, YOU CAN BRING
BACK MY PARENTS AGAIN

14:52.901 --> 14:54.301
Come here.

15:12.261 --> 15:13.694
Where are you?

15:31.181 --> 15:33.331
This is all your fault.

15:33.501 --> 15:36.652
Nothing, really?
Nothing at all?

15:36.821 --> 15:38.971
I will give you something to talk about.

15:47.701 --> 15:49.851
Hey, give back.

15:50.021 --> 15:51.773
Can not you join?
No?

16:07.581 --> 16:08.981
Did you hear that?

16:14.021 --> 16:16.012
I think something is in it.

16:21.701 --> 16:23.896
I think there is something in it.

16:55.701 --> 16:57.339
Kevin, come over here.

17:14.221 --> 17:15.621
Where is Kevin?

17:16.621 --> 17:18.054
He's in it.

17:22.421 --> 17:24.252
Teacher, do not go in there.

17:42.461 --> 17:45.612
Dad, I thought you were already in bed.

17:45.781 --> 17:47.533
I'm going like this.

17:48.781 --> 17:50.419
Really, Dad?

17:51.701 --> 17:55.250
It's just a nightcap,
not like before.

17:55.421 --> 17:59.414
What was that about
today, with that woman?

17:59.581 --> 18:02.937
I have never seen her before and
you went to your bedroom with her.

18:04.301 --> 18:06.735
You're not messing
around with her?

18:06.901 --> 18:09.973
Because I would be so happy
for you if that is the case.

18:10.141 --> 18:12.257
It is not like that at all.

18:17.741 --> 18:20.653
You have to give me a lift tomorrow.

19:13.261 --> 19:18.415
Thank you all for coming.
It was so long ago.

19:18.581 --> 19:21.618
I wish we did not see each other
under these circumstances.

19:28.221 --> 19:30.337
Yesterday a child disappeared.

19:30.501 --> 19:33.334
My brother Kevin, he was taken
away from the classroom.

19:33.501 --> 19:38.814
The boys had to stay behind and
a woman disappeared with him.

19:38.981 --> 19:40.539
It is her.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.169
I tell you, she is.
She is back.

19:43.341 --> 19:46.094
Molly does this again for
what you did to her.

19:46.261 --> 19:48.980
Wait, stop.
Do we know this for sure?

19:49.141 --> 19:52.497
Is she really?
It is impossible, she is dead.

19:52.661 --> 19:54.572
She took my brother from the church.

19:54.741 --> 19:57.460
I saw her dress.
It was a black robe.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.939
Wait a second.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.057
Sorry, but who is Molly?

20:05.221 --> 20:06.939
A child murderer.

20:07.101 --> 20:09.979
It was the winter of '92.

20:10.141 --> 20:12.416
She killed the children from this village.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.334
Our children.

20:16.221 --> 20:18.212
And we did that ourselves.

20:27.181 --> 20:28.853
I win.
- You played false.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.579
Not true.

20:41.941 --> 20:45.934
You could have recorded.
- Do not look at me like that, Amy.

20:46.101 --> 20:48.171
Well, where is your grandfather?

20:48.341 --> 20:51.651
Lock the door behind me and
stay in the car, okay?

20:51.821 --> 20:53.221
I'll be right back.

21:00.381 --> 21:03.293
These are possible observations
of her, as you can see.

21:03.461 --> 21:07.170
And this woman stands up everywhere.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.456
And she is that?
Molly?

21:13.101 --> 21:16.696
People have seen her near
their house in the forest.

21:16.861 --> 21:19.534
They were worried about
possible kidnappings.

21:19.701 --> 21:21.373
That's why they took a picture.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.577
Frau Perchta was a witch...

21:23.741 --> 21:27.336
who stole children's
souls during Christmas.

21:29.061 --> 21:30.972
Frau Perchta?

21:32.981 --> 21:35.097
You're certainly kidding me.

21:35.261 --> 21:39.618
Lesley, Heidi, this is a myth.

21:41.301 --> 21:46.295
This is just a sick copycat
who has seen too many films.

21:46.461 --> 21:51.854
We thought Molly did those terrible
things with our children in 1992.

21:53.661 --> 21:55.492
So we brought her to the forest...

21:57.981 --> 21:59.778
and hung up her.

22:01.061 --> 22:05.339
Sorry, but I had nothing to do with this.
- But your grandmother does.

22:06.301 --> 22:08.132
You are descended from the same bloodline.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.411
We have treated Molly wrongly.

22:12.341 --> 22:15.970
She cursed us that day.

22:18.141 --> 22:22.419
That, one day...

22:22.581 --> 22:27.211
Frau Perchta would come
for us and our children.

22:30.581 --> 22:32.970
This is a myth.

22:34.461 --> 22:39.581
Molly was not some kind of witch
that evoked evil spirits.

22:39.741 --> 22:41.141
You were there.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.500
You heard how she pronounced
those words for her death.

22:45.661 --> 22:49.370
She killed our children.

22:51.741 --> 22:53.652
She received her earned wages.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.854
I have to record this.

23:05.541 --> 23:08.533
Yes, everything is going well here, Joe.

23:08.701 --> 23:11.499
I just wanted to get Tilly to bed.

23:11.661 --> 23:14.858
How long will it be?
I have plans.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.175
You can come in and
join those jokers.

23:35.501 --> 23:39.096
Take a pitchfork and a burning torch
with you, then you'll hear it.

23:39.981 --> 23:42.541
See what myth you can add.

23:42.701 --> 23:44.419
Maybe that of Krampus.

23:49.741 --> 23:51.379
Go to sleep.

23:51.541 --> 23:53.691
I am not tired.

23:53.861 --> 23:56.978
So keep your mouth shut
and do not talk to me.

23:58.821 --> 24:02.291
Excuse me?
- You do what I want, babysitter.

24:02.461 --> 24:06.249
Otherwise I tell my grandfather and grandmother
that you locked me in the closet...

24:06.421 --> 24:10.699
while you invited your boyfriend
to do naughty things.

24:11.861 --> 24:13.897
You little bitch.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.451
We pay you, so I would behave.

24:19.661 --> 24:24.212
Well, do you want a
story before bedtime?

24:24.381 --> 24:28.454
Fine, but not about Snow White
who is lost in the forest...

24:28.621 --> 24:32.978
and live with a number of men.
We know what really happened to Witje.

24:39.781 --> 24:43.933
How about this?
Have you ever heard of Frau Perchta?

24:44.101 --> 24:45.501
Who is that?

24:47.261 --> 24:49.821
Okay, this will be fun.

24:56.141 --> 24:59.258
Frau Perchta was a witch.

24:59.421 --> 25:02.538
She was brutally murdered
by savages in the forest.

25:02.701 --> 25:05.693
In these forests.
Hundreds of years ago, during Christmas.

25:07.221 --> 25:11.100
It is claimed that she
lives in the underworld.

25:11.261 --> 25:16.858
And if you say her name three times
while looking in a mirror...

25:17.021 --> 25:18.977
then she will get you.

25:19.141 --> 25:22.338
Do keep up, girl.
That is <i> Candyman.</i>

25:22.501 --> 25:24.298
Oh, so you do not believe me?

25:41.141 --> 25:42.541
Boys...

25:46.381 --> 25:50.294
I have seen this before.
It is a kind of symbol, a pattern.

25:52.221 --> 25:55.452
Where did I see it?
One of your students signed it.

25:58.341 --> 25:59.741
Yes, you are right.

26:03.741 --> 26:05.141
So do it.

26:09.181 --> 26:11.217
O my God, you are afraid.

26:12.781 --> 26:15.500
Is Tilly scared?
- I'm not afraid.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.219
So do it.

26:26.701 --> 26:29.898
I said three times.
Or can you sometimes not count?

26:36.301 --> 26:38.974
You try to scare me.
That was done pretty cleverly.

26:39.141 --> 26:42.736
Head close, pus.
The candle just went out.

26:52.821 --> 26:56.052
Frau Perchta is a witch
who, during Christmas...

26:56.221 --> 26:58.815
the souls of children stole.

27:01.461 --> 27:04.453
Did you see that?

27:04.621 --> 27:06.021
What was it?

27:16.701 --> 27:18.931
Do not leave me alone.
- Hurry up.

27:21.341 --> 27:24.014
Hide yourself.

27:46.141 --> 27:48.735
I have no range.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.860
This is all your fault.

28:03.021 --> 28:05.535
I had to play that game from you.
- Stop it.

28:11.221 --> 28:12.654
We have to take that phone.

28:12.821 --> 28:15.016
But that is completely down.

28:15.181 --> 28:18.139
I know, but we have to.
We have to leave here.

28:18.301 --> 28:20.769
I can not do it alone.
You have to come with me.

28:20.941 --> 28:24.172
No, I keep the guard and
wait for the witch.

28:24.341 --> 28:26.809
Just go.

28:26.981 --> 28:29.814
It will be fine.

28:29.981 --> 28:32.256
But do not make too much noise.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.331
Go now.
I have to stay here.

28:55.621 --> 28:57.021
There is no one there.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.930
INCOMING CALL

30:03.781 --> 30:05.419
Pick up.

30:06.421 --> 30:08.457
I'll try again.
Come on.

32:18.221 --> 32:21.770
And what now? Are we waiting to see
who was nice and who was naughty?

32:21.941 --> 32:23.738
How do we stop her?

32:23.901 --> 32:25.937
We know she is not a
fan of the church.

32:26.101 --> 32:28.490
How do we know that?
- She took Perry outside.

32:28.661 --> 32:32.017
And she loves darkness.
- The forest is the best place for her.

32:32.181 --> 32:35.890
That is the best hiding place.
We killed her there.

32:36.061 --> 32:38.495
Okay, I have to go.
It is Christmas Eve after all.

32:38.661 --> 32:40.811
I can not stay here any longer.

32:40.981 --> 32:44.257
Martha, be careful.
There are few of us.

32:44.421 --> 32:48.778
And tomorrow is Christmas,
so she has little time.

32:48.941 --> 32:50.659
That also applies to us.

32:51.581 --> 32:53.617
We can not change the past...

32:53.781 --> 32:56.249
so now we have to face
the consequences.

32:59.301 --> 33:01.610
Taking matters into your own hands...

33:01.781 --> 33:03.737
playing for God.

33:03.901 --> 33:05.812
That's why all this happens.

33:07.221 --> 33:10.099
She cursed us that day...

33:10.261 --> 33:13.856
and now we have to endure everything.
- Do not say that.

33:14.021 --> 33:16.854
Do not say that, there is still hope.

33:17.021 --> 33:20.252
I know that for sure, we will
get our little ones back.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.092
Are you following me?

33:38.581 --> 33:40.299
Do not you have a house?

33:40.461 --> 33:43.419
Sweet Child.

33:54.101 --> 33:57.298
What are you doing?
I told you to lock the door.

34:00.181 --> 34:01.978
Come on, we're going home.

34:10.420 --> 34:14.414
We could not know what was
the result of our actions.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.658
You're a good man, Alfie.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.536
I have always loved you.

34:31.061 --> 34:34.212
It was not easy for
me to just leave.

34:35.701 --> 34:39.455
You could not stay with us,
we could not trust you.

34:42.420 --> 34:45.333
Vanessa is also a part
of me, you know that.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.819
You are not the only one who had grief.

34:53.621 --> 34:58.741
I assume I saw my
granddaughter yesterday.

35:00.541 --> 35:03.977
You are not part of my
family, nothing has changed.

35:04.141 --> 35:07.611
Go back to where you came
from when this is over.

35:13.181 --> 35:14.933
I'm afraid, Alfie.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.416
I'm so scared that we can
not survive tonight.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.373
Or Christmas.

35:25.461 --> 35:27.497
She will come after us.

35:27.661 --> 35:29.253
And our daughter.

35:36.181 --> 35:39.969
Meet me here tomorrow morning.

35:43.701 --> 35:45.214
Stay safe.

35:46.541 --> 35:48.179
I see you tomorrow.

36:04.381 --> 36:07.771
I am so sorry.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.453
What is that?

36:43.421 --> 36:47.130
O my God, I think that's blood.
Go inside, Amy.

36:47.301 --> 36:51.089
What is that, Dad?
- We have to clean it.

37:06.221 --> 37:08.277
Good dad, you have to
tell me what's going on.

37:08.341 --> 37:11.572
Because I just talked
to Joe at the church...

37:11.741 --> 37:14.619
and he was talking about myths.

37:14.781 --> 37:17.136
What were you doing in there?

37:18.781 --> 37:22.171
You hide something for me, Dad.
What is it?

37:22.341 --> 37:23.774
Tell me.

37:29.101 --> 37:33.140
You do not have to be afraid
of me, you know that.

37:33.301 --> 37:34.939
Just tell me.

37:41.981 --> 37:43.381
It was...

37:44.461 --> 37:46.691
twenty-five years ago.

37:46.861 --> 37:48.340
During Christmas.

37:49.581 --> 37:51.537
Molly Fletcher was a...

37:52.621 --> 37:55.499
woman who lived in the village.

37:55.661 --> 37:57.731
She was known for being...

37:57.901 --> 37:59.619
weird.

37:59.781 --> 38:01.181
Different.

38:02.941 --> 38:06.616
It was said that her daughter...

38:06.781 --> 38:09.693
behind a cat went into the forest...

38:09.861 --> 38:11.658
and she was never seen again.

38:16.461 --> 38:20.056
During that Christmas, several
children disappeared.

38:21.421 --> 38:25.494
A total of five children
disappeared from the village.

38:25.661 --> 38:29.574
Children's bodies were
found in the forest.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.096
I still worked at the station.

38:33.461 --> 38:39.461
There were stories, rumors
circulating about Molly.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.892
It was said that she was the killer.

38:59.061 --> 39:01.814
Is that your cat?

39:01.981 --> 39:05.690
She had taken the children,
she killed them...

39:06.781 --> 39:11.491
and used their blood for a
weird ceremony, a sacrifice.

39:14.461 --> 39:17.851
Do you want to hear this?
- I do not have a choice, do I?

39:21.021 --> 39:23.216
You do not have to be afraid of me.

39:23.381 --> 39:25.497
You do not have to fight me.

39:25.661 --> 39:31.661
I protect unwanted
children who are at risk.

39:32.021 --> 39:34.296
I am not in danger.

39:36.701 --> 39:38.737
Soon no more.

39:40.141 --> 39:41.893
Can I pet him?

39:50.981 --> 39:53.370
We came together one night.

39:57.821 --> 40:00.335
We're going to hang you up,
that's going to happen.

40:20.861 --> 40:22.931
You are making a big mistake.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.855
Evil is among you.

40:27.021 --> 40:30.218
Your black Christmas
will come back for you.

40:30.381 --> 40:32.941
I call on Frau Perchta.

40:34.101 --> 40:36.979
Frau Perchta, are you there?

40:37.141 --> 40:39.052
Be present at this moment.

40:39.221 --> 40:42.657
She cursed all those present.

40:46.701 --> 40:49.135
Dirty child killer.
Burn in hell.

40:49.301 --> 40:53.499
She said that Frau Perchta,
the witch of Christmas...

40:53.661 --> 40:55.617
revenge.

41:03.421 --> 41:06.618
You get what you deserve.

41:13.141 --> 41:15.974
She would take our children away from us.

41:17.861 --> 41:21.331
She would come to get us
for what we had done...

41:21.501 --> 41:22.901
with her.

41:33.581 --> 41:34.981
Who was that?

41:45.061 --> 41:46.461
We watched...

41:48.381 --> 41:50.337
We watched as she died
through the noose.

41:53.781 --> 41:57.137
You think this...

41:57.301 --> 42:02.250
Frau Perchta is actually here?

42:02.421 --> 42:04.139
You think...

42:04.301 --> 42:08.533
that she has returned for the
children of those involved?

42:08.701 --> 42:11.090
But Dad, how were you involved?

42:11.261 --> 42:16.335
You only have one child.
I mean, I am an only child.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.571
Amy, you have to be more careful.

42:18.741 --> 42:22.131
That could be the woman who took Kevin.
They have not found him yet.

42:22.301 --> 42:25.737
Do not worry, I've seen her before.
She is a nice woman.

42:26.621 --> 42:29.579
Listen, if she wanted to hurt
me, she could have done that.

42:29.741 --> 42:32.778
But she did not.
She is a nice woman.

42:34.981 --> 42:37.495
I have to get more water.
- Amy, wait.

42:41.181 --> 42:42.739
I took this for you.

42:45.541 --> 42:51.252
But I have nothing for you.
- That does not matter, I did not expect anything.

42:51.421 --> 42:52.900
Do you want this one?

42:53.061 --> 42:55.814
It is not the best gift,
but I do not have more.

43:00.941 --> 43:02.533
Do you want to come in?

43:02.701 --> 43:06.091
My aunt will worry, I
have to go back again.

43:06.261 --> 43:09.617
Do not celebrate Christmas with your parents?
- I liked that.

43:09.781 --> 43:13.091
They are gone again.
But I have seen you in any case.

43:16.901 --> 43:21.099
Callum, I was badly injured.
You can not just walk away.

43:21.261 --> 43:22.774
Come with me.

43:24.541 --> 43:27.260
Say goodbye to Amy.

43:27.421 --> 43:29.298
Take care, Amy.

43:39.741 --> 43:41.459
Where is your mom?

43:42.621 --> 43:46.773
Come in. You can stay here
until your mom is back.

43:58.141 --> 44:00.530
I am an only child.

44:00.701 --> 44:02.293
You had a sister.

44:06.021 --> 44:08.819
She was three years older than you.

44:11.701 --> 44:14.977
She was six when she went missing.

44:15.141 --> 44:18.258
We did not tell you
anything because we...

44:19.301 --> 44:23.135
not being able to relive
that part of our lives.

44:24.701 --> 44:28.330
And what did you have to know?

44:32.661 --> 44:34.777
I do not know what to say, Dad.

44:40.381 --> 44:42.497
Did Mom leave?

44:43.861 --> 44:45.261
It was...

44:47.301 --> 44:50.896
for both of us a very
difficult period.

44:52.661 --> 44:56.939
Damn, Dad, seriously.
What are you saying?

45:02.141 --> 45:05.497
I'll be looking at you again
tomorrow morning, okay? Sleep tight.

45:08.981 --> 45:13.213
And do not make a sound. When my
mother sees you, she throws you out.

45:24.461 --> 45:26.258
Callum, be careful.

45:32.181 --> 45:34.092
Are you okay?
- Awesome.

45:35.661 --> 45:37.811
What is it?
- I have a flat tire.

45:37.981 --> 45:40.859
Then push it. Maybe you'll
get a new one from Santa.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.299
Let's go, Callum.

45:52.461 --> 45:54.019
I'm very cold.

45:55.021 --> 45:56.898
Then turn it around.

46:01.501 --> 46:03.731
That helps, right?

46:05.741 --> 46:07.141
What is that?

46:37.141 --> 46:38.813
Who did this?

46:51.501 --> 46:55.699
Aunt.
Let someone help us, please.

47:19.101 --> 47:21.899
Please, no.
Stop.

48:12.621 --> 48:14.930
Stay with me.

48:15.101 --> 48:18.173
Flight.

48:24.701 --> 48:26.453
Someone, help.

49:04.581 --> 49:07.254
Amy, what are you doing?

49:07.421 --> 49:10.811
Nothing.
This is for Santa.

49:10.981 --> 49:15.099
And the roots for Rudolph?
- We have no roots anymore.

49:20.261 --> 49:23.458
You mean so much to me, you know that?

49:23.621 --> 49:26.977
I love you mom.
- I also belong to you, honey.

49:28.661 --> 49:30.936
Sleep tight.

51:46.581 --> 51:48.492
Dad, what are you doing?

51:48.661 --> 51:51.414
You have to give me a lift again.

51:51.581 --> 51:55.654
But we really have to talk, Dad.
- I have to go back to church.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.221
Please, Vanessa.

51:58.221 --> 51:59.859
Good, fine.

52:05.781 --> 52:09.171
You came.
- I hope you do not mind...

52:09.341 --> 52:10.979
but I took someone.

52:21.541 --> 52:25.056
You do not mean this.

52:25.221 --> 52:28.930
It's Christmas.
I did not know he would take her...

52:29.101 --> 52:33.413
but can we just keep it fun?
For me?

52:35.701 --> 52:37.931
I think I have to surrender.

52:43.461 --> 52:46.498
I thought you knew.
- Of course I did not know.

52:46.661 --> 52:49.255
Look, Amy did this
behind my back...

52:50.381 --> 52:54.977
but we will have to behave.
For Amy and because it is Christmas.

52:55.141 --> 52:57.132
But you should not have taken her with you.

52:57.301 --> 53:00.418
I mean...
- Ness, are you ready?

53:00.581 --> 53:02.333
Where are you going?
We are just there.

53:02.501 --> 53:04.617
I'll be back in an hour.

53:13.221 --> 53:15.860
Amy, shall we open your presents?

53:16.021 --> 53:17.818
I also have one for you.

53:17.981 --> 53:20.939
Oh, that did not matter.

53:21.101 --> 53:24.332
It is too precious, I do
not think you like it.

53:24.501 --> 53:27.095
I also have to leave.

53:35.021 --> 53:39.253
This is amazing.
We could have just stayed home.

54:04.501 --> 54:06.412
Dad, what's wrong?

54:07.741 --> 54:10.050
Are you coming with me?
I need you.

54:10.221 --> 54:12.212
Yes of course.

54:39.301 --> 54:40.973
She was right.

54:44.901 --> 54:46.459
They all disappeared.

54:48.061 --> 54:50.177
I am the only one left.

54:56.901 --> 54:59.210
Amy, please come out.

54:59.381 --> 55:01.099
I'll be right there.

55:01.261 --> 55:03.695
I came here for you, Amy.

55:07.341 --> 55:11.653
Can not we just celebrate
Christmas together, as a family?

55:11.821 --> 55:13.698
She is hiding from me.

55:13.861 --> 55:15.214
What is this?

55:15.381 --> 55:18.453
Are you trying to protect
yourself from vampires?

55:18.621 --> 55:22.580
Are we going to start eating like this?
- Yes, that's a good idea.

55:22.741 --> 55:25.972
If they are back then, we can
really celebrate Christmas.

55:31.741 --> 55:33.732
Where is she?
She should be here.

56:23.141 --> 56:24.620
Dad, is she my mother?

56:32.341 --> 56:34.377
We have to go.

56:51.861 --> 56:54.011
Just in time.
The food is almost ready.

56:55.581 --> 56:58.379
Looks pretty cold, Debs.
Is it overcooked?

57:04.981 --> 57:07.290
Where are you?

57:07.461 --> 57:10.897
So, Vanessa, what are you doing exactly?

57:11.061 --> 57:14.019
Wildon told you that you are a nurse.
Is that right?

57:15.981 --> 57:18.734
I am a district nurse.

57:18.901 --> 57:22.052
That must be very satisfying work.

57:22.221 --> 57:24.894
I go to people and I
take care of them.

57:25.061 --> 57:26.574
And Debbie, what are you doing?

57:27.501 --> 57:32.291
I am going to start my own hair salon.
There is still nothing fixed...

57:32.461 --> 57:34.213
but I have looked at a room.

57:36.341 --> 57:38.730
He is a bit scary.

57:38.901 --> 57:41.574
Why are you here?
- Please, it's Christmas.

57:41.741 --> 57:44.494
No, seriously, why are you here?
I do not understand.

57:45.501 --> 57:48.857
Because you left for
her two months ago?

57:49.021 --> 57:52.900
This waste of oxygen,
this <i> wannabe?</i>

57:53.061 --> 57:56.690
Are you trying to rub me in
sometimes, Wildon? Is that it?

57:56.861 --> 58:00.774
Well done then.
It really works.

58:00.941 --> 58:03.978
You invited us.
- No, I did not do that.

58:07.021 --> 58:09.535
Why can not you just be nice?

58:09.701 --> 58:12.659
It is not only your
Christmas, but also mine.

58:13.621 --> 58:16.135
And I just want my family back.

58:21.981 --> 58:25.132
Nice to meet you.
Wildon, I'll see you in the car.

58:25.301 --> 58:27.656
Wait.
- No, go on.

58:27.821 --> 58:33.214
And take that filthy turkey,
chicken, whatever it is, with you.

58:43.301 --> 58:46.930
Go away.
- Amy, just open the door.

58:52.021 --> 58:55.491
Amy, open up.
I'm so sorry, please.

59:05.581 --> 59:07.651
I did not want to leave you.

59:09.301 --> 59:11.053
Then why did you do it?

59:13.421 --> 59:14.934
Were you afraid of growing old?

59:15.101 --> 59:19.014
Did you exchange me for a
younger, more beautiful version?

59:21.341 --> 59:24.014
Why did you take her, Wildon?

59:24.181 --> 59:27.139
With your matching sweaters.

59:27.301 --> 59:30.896
Did you just want to rub it in?

59:31.061 --> 59:36.010
Like a crust you just
pull off and show...

59:36.181 --> 59:39.935
what your new life
is and the new you.

59:40.101 --> 59:41.773
It is sick.

59:46.141 --> 59:51.056
I've ruined everything.
For you, for Amy.

59:51.221 --> 59:54.338
Yes, you can say that.

59:58.301 --> 01:00:00.735
Can you please just go?

01:00:08.981 --> 01:00:10.972
Crazy crazy.

01:00:21.461 --> 01:00:23.497
She never left you, did she?

01:00:25.381 --> 01:00:27.099
Or do you, Dad?

01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:30.298
And what is this, damn it?
Were you a policeman?

01:00:33.221 --> 01:00:36.019
What did you say about the past?

01:00:36.181 --> 01:00:38.979
Did you drink?
Because you're a big liar?

01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:44.894
And is that Lesley my mother?

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:49.020
Just tell me, Dad.
I can no longer handle those lies.

01:01:24.621 --> 01:01:27.260
Come on, help me.
- Call a doctor.

01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:40.540
She's here.
- Dad, what the hell is going on?

01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:43.693
I have no range.
- Do not worry, she can not go inside.

01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:46.811
Frau Perchta is back.
- Debbie, look at me.

01:01:46.981 --> 01:01:50.291
Who is that?
- Stay damn calm.

01:01:50.461 --> 01:01:54.579
Stay with me, everything will be fine.
- We have to stay here.

01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:59.178
Keep breathing, we'll get out of here.
- We have to stay here.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:02.651
I know, but we can
not stay here, Dad.

01:02:10.261 --> 01:02:12.729
Come here.

01:02:25.901 --> 01:02:28.131
You are the best cat ever.

01:02:28.301 --> 01:02:30.656
Why did you leave?

01:02:32.901 --> 01:02:36.416
Amy, no.
- Amy, come back.

01:02:39.581 --> 01:02:41.094
Come on in.

01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:55.136
Pick up, the lights stop the witch.

01:02:55.301 --> 01:02:57.735
Keep them close to you.
Listen to me.

01:02:57.901 --> 01:03:01.052
I am not going to lose my
family, do you understand me?

01:03:02.221 --> 01:03:06.373
Everything is fine, just stay with me.

01:03:16.781 --> 01:03:19.136
We'll get you out of here and
then everything will be fine.

01:03:24.261 --> 01:03:25.899
Daddy?

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:39.294
Debbie is fine.

01:04:05.061 --> 01:04:09.134
Come here.

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:13.581
I'm sorry, Ness. I could not tell
you who your mother really was.

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:17.251
It was too dangerous for you.

01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:19.093
And for Amy.

01:08:20.981 --> 01:08:24.609
She did not want to leave me...

01:08:25.621 --> 01:08:30.296
but I had to protect you.
I protected you from her.

01:08:30.461 --> 01:08:33.020
Dad, I do not understand what you're talking about.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.411
I do not understand.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.211
I do not understand what you're saying.

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.133
But I have to go.

01:08:44.261 --> 01:08:46.821
I have to go, Dad.

01:08:46.981 --> 01:08:49.779
I have to protect Amy.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.658
I love you, Dad.

01:11:24.741 --> 01:11:27.574
It looks bad.
- Leave it.

01:10:55.805 --> 01:10:58.478
I have always loved you.

01:11:01.125 --> 01:11:03.002
I love you.

01:11:03.965 --> 01:11:06.798
It was just too much for me.

01:11:08.165 --> 01:11:13.159
Between us and Amy was...
- I know.

01:11:14.725 --> 01:11:17.114
Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:11:24.165 --> 01:11:25.883
I love you.

01:11:26.045 --> 01:11:30.038
And if we get out of here...
Are we going to get out of here?

01:11:30.205 --> 01:11:32.435
We're going to get out of here.

01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:38.355
Are you sure?
We have to get out of here.

01:11:38.525 --> 01:11:40.993
I take care of that.

01:11:41.165 --> 01:11:43.281
You and me and Amy.

01:11:43.445 --> 01:11:45.481
We all three.

01:11:45.645 --> 01:11:47.124
I love you.

01:11:47.285 --> 01:11:48.843
I also from you.

01:11:53.805 --> 01:11:55.955
I become the best husband ever.

01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:59.322
You better.

01:12:01.365 --> 01:12:03.162
Promise it.
- I promise.

01:12:03.325 --> 01:12:06.442
You can not leave me again.
- I promise.

01:12:06.605 --> 01:12:08.721
I'm going to find Amy.

01:12:10.485 --> 01:12:12.123
I love you.
- I also belong to you.

01:12:17.285 --> 01:12:19.241
I am your man, right?

01:12:22.525 --> 01:12:23.925
Wait here.

01:13:24.645 --> 01:13:26.601
Dad, behind you.

01:14:06.183 --> 01:14:08.060
You killed my daddy.

01:14:09.063 --> 01:14:11.213
Stay away from me.

01:14:11.383 --> 01:14:13.294
Leave her alone, witch.

01:14:32.663 --> 01:14:34.063
Amy, come here.

01:14:38.783 --> 01:14:40.183
Amy, come on.

01:14:48.543 --> 01:14:50.454
Here, Amy.

01:15:32.423 --> 01:15:35.574
It will be all right.
- I'm afraid.

01:15:35.743 --> 01:15:38.894
I know that, honey.
I know that.

01:15:39.063 --> 01:15:41.816
But it's all right,
because your mom is here.

01:15:43.023 --> 01:15:44.661
Mamma is with you.

01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:05.532
I promise.

01:16:05.703 --> 01:16:08.581
You know that.
- It's all my fault.

01:16:08.743 --> 01:16:11.496
It is my fault, I should
not have opened the door.

01:16:11.663 --> 01:16:15.133
It is my fault that Daddy is dead.

01:16:15.303 --> 01:16:18.613
Never say that to me again.

01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:22.332
Your daddy loved you so much.

01:16:22.503 --> 01:16:27.054
He thought you were the most beautiful in the world.

01:16:27.223 --> 01:16:29.657
Please never say that to me again.

01:16:29.823 --> 01:16:33.338
I promise you, honey, okay?

01:16:48.143 --> 01:16:49.861
Stay there.

01:17:44.303 --> 01:17:46.134
What did she do to you?

01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:50.336
Frau...
Where is she?

01:19:12.423 --> 01:19:15.221
It will be fine with you.

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:25.135
I can not get rid of you,
I've already lost Dad.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:27.863
It will be okay.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:37.693
Keep looking at me.
Do not leave me.

01:19:37.863 --> 01:19:39.455
Stay with me.

01:19:40.623 --> 01:19:42.932
Stay with me.

01:19:58.863 --> 01:20:03.300
You can not leave me alone.

01:20:10.943 --> 01:20:13.696
Stay away from me.

01:20:15.463 --> 01:20:18.773
Do not hurt me please.

01:20:18.943 --> 01:20:21.696
I'm just protecting you, child.

01:20:21.863 --> 01:20:24.252
I do not understand.

01:20:24.423 --> 01:20:27.540
I will show you that you do
not have to be afraid of me.

01:21:03.703 --> 01:21:06.501
It was Molly Fletcher.
She killed them all.

01:21:06.663 --> 01:21:08.654
Even her own daughter, I saw it myself.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:13.374
She does black magic in the forest.
- She uses the blood for her spells.

01:21:18.503 --> 01:21:20.300
There she is.

01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:40.983
DAUGHTER

01:21:45.663 --> 01:21:47.335
What have you done?

01:21:49.103 --> 01:21:54.382
I had to keep your secret.
I had to protect you.

01:21:55.743 --> 01:21:57.256
I love you.

01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:03.181
They would have known otherwise.

01:22:04.463 --> 01:22:07.057
I had to take one of us away.

01:22:10.823 --> 01:22:12.700
She took them from us.

01:22:13.703 --> 01:22:15.580
She took them all away from us.

01:22:16.743 --> 01:22:19.655
Alfie, we have to go.
- We can not leave them.

01:22:19.823 --> 01:22:21.700
There is nothing left of them.

01:22:21.863 --> 01:22:23.342
Get in the car.

01:22:23.503 --> 01:22:26.381
Alfie, she's coming for us.
Fast.

01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:42.099
Do not come near me.

01:22:43.943 --> 01:22:47.731
Stay away from me.
- Amy, we have to go.

01:22:47.903 --> 01:22:50.053
I know what you did.

01:22:50.223 --> 01:22:53.101
What you have done.
- You know nothing.

01:22:53.263 --> 01:22:56.414
You killed all those children.

01:22:56.583 --> 01:22:59.780
And you helped.
- Amy, you do not understand.

01:22:59.943 --> 01:23:04.778
You killed Mamma's sister.
- Come on.

01:23:22.103 --> 01:23:24.936
Sorry.

01:26:05.503 --> 01:26:07.698
He is coming.

01:26:48.383 --> 01:26:53.059
This is your home now.
