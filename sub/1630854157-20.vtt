Hi, honey, how was school today?

00:36.595 --> 00:39.279
Well, the metal detectors
were down, so the popular kids

00:39.431 --> 00:41.874
were all on edge all day,
so that was kind of fun.

00:42.025 --> 00:43.876
Oh, and we also got
our yearbooks.

00:44.027 --> 00:45.527
Ooh, let me see.

00:45.546 --> 00:49.106
I love seeing what my handsome
boy's been up to all year.

00:49.124 --> 00:53.034
Oh, there's the student council,
and the cheerleaders.

00:53.128 --> 00:55.703
Peter, w-why is there
a photo of you in here?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.281
I'm in the Peter club.

00:57.283 --> 00:59.633
It's just me and this guy Jason
who joined as a joke.

00:59.802 --> 01:02.227
Jason's, like, hilarious.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.805
Wait a minute. Chris,
there's no pictures of you.

01:04.957 --> 01:06.398
Huh, I guess not.

01:06.550 --> 01:07.808
Chris, honey,
I keep telling you,

01:07.902 --> 01:11.386
you need to get involved
in extracurricular activities.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.905
Otherwise you won't
get into college,

01:13.056 --> 01:14.573
and you'll end up a garbageman

01:14.724 --> 01:16.650
or a congresswoman
from Colorado.

01:16.802 --> 01:20.137
Okay, okay, fine.
I'll look for a club tomorrow.

01:20.155 --> 01:22.322
Your mom's right, Chris.
You got to get into college.

01:22.474 --> 01:23.974
Mostly so you can constantly

01:24.067 --> 01:26.418
jam into conversation
where you went.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.754
Have you been to that new
restaurant, Kristof's, downtown?

01:28.981 --> 01:31.256
-It's amazing.
-No, but that reminds me

01:31.333 --> 01:33.150
of when I was at school
in Cambridge.

01:33.243 --> 01:34.668
Oh, you went to Harvard?

01:34.762 --> 01:38.430
No, the Cambridge Technical
College for Dullards and Mutes.

01:38.657 --> 01:42.226
Not to brag, but there are
commercials for it on TV.

01:46.498 --> 01:49.942
Because it's embarrassing
to see you in jeans at church.

01:50.018 --> 01:51.593
That's why.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.687
Yeah, I'm sure it<i> was</i> fine
back home in Tampa.

01:53.839 --> 01:55.021
Now hold still.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.357
Hey, Brian, could you drive me
to Joann Fabrics?

01:57.451 --> 02:00.768
I'm gonna put in some elastic
'cause I've learned my lesson.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.362
Sure, just got to stop
at the bank.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.030
Still getting my accounts
sorted out

02:04.125 --> 02:05.349
after that Russian hacker thing.

02:05.367 --> 02:07.184
Ah, yes, that Ivan fellow.

02:07.202 --> 02:09.519
I can't believe Meg
stayed behind to be with him.

02:09.538 --> 02:11.204
Well, they seemed
pretty happy together.

02:11.357 --> 02:13.874
Still, it's got to be hard
leaving your whole life behind

02:13.968 --> 02:16.026
and adapting
to a foreign culture.

02:16.044 --> 02:17.694

04:57.856 --> 04:59.113

04:59.133 --> 05:00.632

05:44.920 --> 05:46.345
You need to drive slower, man.

05:46.572 --> 05:48.572
I don't think he heard
the end of my threat.

05:48.590 --> 05:51.183
Uh, well, maybe your threat
should be more succinct.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.077
Well, maybe you should call
our boss "papa" again.

05:54.096 --> 05:56.462
It was mistake. One time.

05:56.598 --> 05:58.565
One time I do this.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.029
LOIS:
Chris? Did you find
an after-school activity yet?

06:04.256 --> 06:05.922
Working on it, Mom.

06:06.015 --> 06:09.534
"In conclusion, municipal
zoning laws have ultimately hurt

06:09.686 --> 06:11.778
the very people
they're intended to help."

06:11.930 --> 06:13.372
And send.

06:13.523 --> 06:15.707
Gosh, who knew there was
so much civil discourse

06:15.859 --> 06:17.876
in the Pornhub comments section?

06:18.027 --> 06:20.045
All right, back to business.

06:20.196 --> 06:23.882
Hmm. This one's just called
"Sex in a School."

06:24.033 --> 06:26.793
(porn music playing)

06:26.945 --> 06:28.053
Whoa, that's crazy.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.389
This set looks
just like my homeroom.

06:32.784 --> 06:35.785
Huh, the porn school
has a Chris Griffin, too?

06:35.879 --> 06:37.712
It's so immersive.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.564
Wait a minute.

06:44.796 --> 06:46.980
Is this my school?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.798
<i> SHEPHERD (over video):</i>
<i> Attention, naughty students.</i>

06:48.817 --> 06:50.817
<i> Ass is now in session.</i>

06:50.969 --> 06:54.413
Oh, my God, Principal Shepherd's
making porn at school.

06:54.564 --> 06:56.248
Hey, I'm gonna shut
this door real quick.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.917
Rupert's pants came back
and he doesn't fit into them,

06:59.068 --> 07:01.253
so, so we're having a thing.

07:07.836 --> 07:09.335
Oh, you know what, guys?

07:09.430 --> 07:12.172
I think some of these letters
are, like, numbers.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.990
(sighs)
We got to start over.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.159
Chris, can you erase
the boards for me?

07:16.178 --> 07:19.086
-Kiss my shorts.
-(all gasp)

07:19.181 --> 07:21.014
Chris, I hear you've been
acting up in class

07:21.166 --> 07:23.500
and carelessly misquoting
<i> The Simpsons.</i>

07:23.502 --> 07:26.761
Yeah, well,
don't have a moo, man.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.780
(gasps)
The slacker's position.

07:28.932 --> 07:31.841
Young man, in this school,
furniture has rules.

07:31.860 --> 07:35.361
Well, guess what? I'm gonna do
whatever I want around here,

07:35.456 --> 07:37.847
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

07:37.941 --> 07:39.849
Oh, really? And why is that?

07:39.868 --> 07:43.186
'Cause I know you've been
making porn in the school.

07:43.188 --> 07:45.112
I... You can't prove that.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.207
I heard your voice
on one of the videos.

07:47.359 --> 07:49.784
(sighs)
All right, you caught me.

07:49.861 --> 07:53.363
You see, Chris, we educators
don't make a lot of money.

07:53.456 --> 07:56.049
So, once I saw I had
the classrooms at my disposal,

07:56.201 --> 07:57.550
plus all the school
A/V equipment,

07:57.703 --> 08:00.537
I realized I was only
a box of wet naps away

08:00.555 --> 08:03.482
from becoming a pornographer,
so I gave it a shot.

08:03.633 --> 08:06.968
<i> Hamilton</i> tells me you're not
supposed to throw those away.

08:07.136 --> 08:09.896
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm not making any money.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.157
My videos hardly get any views.

08:12.308 --> 08:15.309
I think it's time for me
to throw in the sticky towel.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.479
Wow, that's a pretty sad story,
Principal Shepherd.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.057
But you want to know
the saddest part of all?

08:21.150 --> 08:22.984
Your porn sucks, bro.

08:23.078 --> 08:24.836
What? What are you
talking about?

08:25.029 --> 08:26.746
Well, let's start
with the titles.

08:26.898 --> 08:31.084
Who calls their porno "Man
and Woman Having Standard Sex"?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.419
You got to work
the algorithm, man.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.014
You need keywords
like "stepsister,"

08:36.165 --> 08:38.091
"stepbrother," "stepmom."

08:38.185 --> 08:41.019
Just put "step" and a noun
and it should work.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.414
Even "stepladder"
is getting traction these days.

08:44.432 --> 08:46.173
You know, if you want
to make this thing work

08:46.268 --> 08:48.843
and start making money,
I can help you out.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.529
You want to help me?

08:50.756 --> 08:52.272
Actually, I think
we can help each other.

08:52.424 --> 08:53.848
You need help with this thing,

08:53.942 --> 08:57.260
I need an after-school activity
so my mom gets off my back,

08:57.262 --> 08:59.262
and I think I just found it.

08:59.264 --> 09:03.283
I'm the newest member
of the porn club.

09:03.435 --> 09:05.860
-All right, deal.
-Awesome.

09:05.937 --> 09:10.131
I feel like I've finally found
my calling, like Steve Martin.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.108
I've got it.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.035
I'll do five years
of entertainment,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.704

-Hello?

09:19.134 --> 09:22.209
No, I don't want
ten million dollars for a movie.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.063
Call back when you've got
14 banjo fans

09:25.214 --> 09:27.807
in your city's worst theater.

Ivan.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.250
W-What happened?

09:45.401 --> 09:47.419
Everyone here
was silenced by state

09:47.570 --> 09:49.421
for careless social media post.

09:49.572 --> 09:51.981

Putin can be very sensitive...

10:43.051 --> 10:46.311
Oh, yeah, it has
a very dedicated fan base.

10:46.462 --> 10:48.647
Plus, the actors don't even
have to be attractive.

10:48.874 --> 10:51.040
(chuckles):
You ever see a hot lunch lady?

10:51.134 --> 10:53.801
No. It ruins the fantasy.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.803
Ready when you are, Mr. G.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.489
All right, places.

10:57.716 --> 11:00.550
"Sloppy Hoes,"
scene one, take one. Mark.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.385
Tarps up.

11:02.404 --> 11:03.736
And action.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.146
(porn music plays)

11:05.165 --> 11:08.558
Cut. Get that cigarette
out of the shot.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.669
Kids are gonna watch this.

11:13.674 --> 11:14.914
I got to hand it to you, Chris,

11:15.008 --> 11:17.583
our videos have been
quite a success.

11:17.736 --> 11:19.585
I haven't felt this kind
of financial security

11:19.680 --> 11:22.922
since I found 20 bucks in one
of the lost-and-found jackets.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.832
In fact, I took the liberty
of buying us

11:24.926 --> 11:26.518
a little something to celebrate.

11:26.669 --> 11:27.911
Come on.

11:27.929 --> 11:30.522
-Wow, is that...
-That's right.

11:30.673 --> 11:32.765
The 1992 Toyota Cressida.

11:32.918 --> 11:34.584
The ultimate
principal dream car.

11:34.602 --> 11:37.344
Shallot purple
with a beige interior.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.440
-And there's one for each of us.
-Gosh, really?

11:40.592 --> 11:43.609
No one's ever given me
anything this nice before.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.852
Well, you earned it.

11:44.946 --> 11:46.353
Turns out, you just needed

11:46.373 --> 11:48.206
to find something
you could excel at.

11:48.433 --> 11:49.824
Thanks, Principal Shepherd.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.693
Say, how about we drive
these babies down to Chipotle

11:52.713 --> 11:55.104
and order guac like big shots?

11:55.123 --> 11:56.864
I saw Elon Musk do that once.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.624
Was it after
his hair transplant?

11:58.777 --> 12:02.637
After one of his two
separate hair transplants, yes.

12:05.875 --> 12:09.728
Aw. It was so sweet of you
to plan this picnic, Ivan.

12:09.879 --> 12:11.637
But why are we in a cemetery?

12:11.732 --> 12:16.401
Meg, I brings you here because
cemetery is very special place.

12:16.628 --> 12:19.988
It is here where you can
finally meet my parents.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.149
Your parents are dead?

12:23.226 --> 12:25.243
Oh, Ivan, I'm so sorry.

12:25.394 --> 12:29.322
It's okay. They died peacefully
being ripped apart by dogs.

12:29.491 --> 12:33.159
Meg, when you were in hospital,
I was so afraid to lose you.

12:33.311 --> 12:37.238
And in that moment, I realized
I never want us to be apart.

12:37.332 --> 12:40.759
-Meg, will you marry me?
-(gasps)

12:40.986 --> 12:42.076
I do not have much to give,

12:42.245 --> 12:44.971
but I do have
mother's engagement ring.

12:48.417 --> 12:49.659
What do you say, Meg?

12:49.752 --> 12:52.178
Will you make me happiest man
in all of Russia?

12:52.330 --> 12:54.439
Which is admittedly
a very low bar?

12:54.590 --> 12:57.258
Oh, Ivan. Yes, yes, yes.

12:57.335 --> 12:59.669
Then come with me
and let's take brown clothes,

12:59.762 --> 13:01.613
not-smiling engagement photo.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.114
-(camera shutter clicks)
-I cannot wait

13:03.341 --> 13:07.452
to etch this picture of you
into hideous black gravestone.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.197
Which background you want?
Frozen tundra or leaky reactor?

13:11.349 --> 13:13.016
-Oh, oh, reactor, please.
-Reactor, please.

13:13.018 --> 13:16.544
Don't know why I offer tundra.
Nobody choose.

13:19.115 --> 13:20.857
Hey, where are you going?

13:20.875 --> 13:22.208
Dinner's gonna be ready
any minute.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.377
Oh, I-I have to get to school.

13:24.529 --> 13:27.547
I have to meet up with
the, uh, uh, debate club.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.123
At 8:00 p.m.?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.367
Yeah, there was
a whole debate about it.

13:31.369 --> 13:34.220
Well I am so glad you finally
found an extracurricular.

13:34.372 --> 13:36.314
This is gonna look great
on your college résumé.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.708
And maybe you'll make
some new friends.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.968
I am so proud of you.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.880
-No, you're not.
-What? Of course I am.

13:43.898 --> 13:46.883
Ah, gotcha. You got debated.

13:46.901 --> 13:49.235
Oh, so advanced already.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.071
(laughs):
Okay, have fun.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.248
I brought your favorite:

14:19.250 --> 14:21.508
spaghetti with butter
and nothing else.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.936
I'm told it's a sign
of a developmental disorder,

14:24.030 --> 14:26.105
but I'm not ready
to confront that yet.

14:26.257 --> 14:28.366
-(porn music playing)
-Chris?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.035
Cut. Okay, Klaara?

14:31.262 --> 14:33.354
Klaara, honey,
um, before this next take,

14:33.373 --> 14:37.600
can you move your baby
or get him to stop crying?

14:37.693 --> 14:39.026
There's my handsome boy.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.362
Mom? What are you doing here?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.623
Well, I didn't want you doing
argument-sports

14:43.775 --> 14:45.699
on an empty stomach, so I...

14:45.793 --> 14:48.127
Wait, this is the debate club?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.129
W-What's with all the lights
and the cameras?

14:50.223 --> 14:52.539
A-Are you guys making a movie?

14:52.634 --> 14:53.975

Crocs and Arby's?

15:12.487 --> 15:16.139
Chris, you lied to me.
And for something so disgusting.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.749
Mom, I-I can explain.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.751
Oh, and on school grounds,
no less.

15:19.902 --> 15:22.754
Just you wait until Principal
Shepherd hears about this.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.163
Well, CVS didn't
have any towels,

15:24.315 --> 15:25.498
so follow me to the science lab

15:25.592 --> 15:28.484
and I'll show you where
the eye-wash stations are.

15:28.503 --> 15:30.244
-Mrs. Griffin?
-Principal Shepherd,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.171
are you in on this, too?

15:32.323 --> 15:35.158
Certainly not. I have no idea
what's going on here.

15:35.251 --> 15:37.268
Principal Shepherd,
Starla is officially a no-show,

15:37.495 --> 15:39.270
so the nine-some
is now an eight-some.

15:39.422 --> 15:41.180
All right, put her per diem
back in petty cash,

15:41.332 --> 15:43.441
tell Sue Ann in makeup
it's her lucky day,

15:43.668 --> 15:45.668
tell lighting
it's legs up in five,

15:45.761 --> 15:47.428
and let's shoot this thing.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.739
I mean, what?

15:52.694 --> 15:56.028
We begin with a reading
from the Russian Orthodox Bible.

15:56.181 --> 15:58.014
And Jesus said to Mikhail,

15:58.032 --> 16:00.549
"The radio you sold me last week
does not work."

16:00.609 --> 16:02.609
Mikhail said to Him,
"How do I know

16:02.629 --> 16:05.446
you didn't break it on purpose
to get your money back?"

16:05.465 --> 16:07.781
Then they got in a fistfight
on the bus.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.525
-Amen.
-BOTH: Amen.

16:09.618 --> 16:12.453
I now pronounce Ukraine
actually part of Russia,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.214
and I also pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:15.366 --> 16:17.642
You may share a joyless kiss.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.857
(audience shouting)

16:25.043 --> 16:26.467
This is an outrage.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.894
Porn doesn't belong in school,
it belongs on public trains.

16:29.047 --> 16:30.880
I guess if I don't bring
brownies, nobody does.

16:30.973 --> 16:32.732
Please, everyone,
not all at once.

16:32.884 --> 16:36.552
Is there an Alpha Karen
who can speak for all of you?

16:36.645 --> 16:39.330
First of all, I want you to know
I'm filming this.

16:39.482 --> 16:43.059
Second of all, I'm gonna
get really angry really fast

16:43.077 --> 16:44.168
for no reason.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.912
Listen, folks, I-I can explain.

16:47.081 --> 16:48.247
What is there to explain?

16:48.399 --> 16:49.749
That you've been using
our children's school

16:49.843 --> 16:51.083
to make pornography?

16:51.236 --> 16:53.511
That-that you took advantage
of my son?

16:53.696 --> 16:54.828
(overlapping chatter)

16:54.922 --> 16:56.255
This is getting away from me.

16:56.407 --> 16:57.865
Maybe I can filibuster this

16:57.925 --> 17:01.244
by reading the owner's manual
for my Toyota Cressida.

17:01.262 --> 17:04.413
"Dear consumer,
making cars is really hard.

17:04.507 --> 17:07.750
There are so many parts,
you guys."

17:07.769 --> 17:10.153
(indistinct shouting)

17:13.199 --> 17:14.924
Wait. Everybody, wait a minute.

17:14.942 --> 17:17.201
That's the boy who was
talking to an owl outside.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.928
Let him speak.

17:18.946 --> 17:21.355
Look, Principal Shepherd may
have made some bad decisions,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.266
but he didn't do it for himself.

17:23.284 --> 17:26.193
It was all to raise money
for the school.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.272
Oh, is-is that true,
Principal Shepherd?

17:29.290 --> 17:30.289
Um...

17:30.383 --> 17:32.366
-Well, I-I...
-Of course it's true.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.111
Every year they slash
the school budget,

17:35.129 --> 17:36.462
and this man did
what he had to do

17:36.556 --> 17:38.872
to give us the education
we deserve.

17:38.966 --> 17:40.892
You know the reading specialist
we have?

17:41.043 --> 17:43.636
Paid for by a "Das Boot."

17:43.805 --> 17:45.471
What's a "Das Boot"?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.714
That's when a whole bunch
of German men

17:47.809 --> 17:49.442
go down at the same time.

17:51.479 --> 17:52.645
He's right, everyone.

17:52.797 --> 17:54.797
With all those budget cuts,
I had no choice.

17:54.890 --> 17:58.392
It was either make porn,
or pass a modest tax increase

17:58.411 --> 18:00.745
on the wealthiest citizens
of Quahog.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.822
A tax hike that'll affect
none of us?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.824
That's the last thing we want.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.085
-Meeting adjourned.
-(indistinct chatter)

18:07.253 --> 18:09.403
Chris, that was some
quick thinking back there.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.164
You saved my career. Thank you.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.740
Hold it right there,
Principal Shepherd.

18:13.835 --> 18:15.835
Now, I appreciate that you were
trying to help out the school,

18:15.929 --> 18:19.079
but how could you get my son
involved in something like this?

18:19.099 --> 18:21.748
-You've corrupted him.
-"Corrupted"?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.510
This was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.086
See, before we started
making porn,

18:26.180 --> 18:27.438
I didn't care about anything

18:27.590 --> 18:29.273
because I wasn't good
at anything.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.835
But now, I'm using skills
I never knew I had.

18:32.854 --> 18:36.839
I'm writing scripts, making
schedules and balancing budgets.

18:36.858 --> 18:39.933
And it's all thanks
to Principal Shepherd.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.666
Yeah, that's a great idea.
