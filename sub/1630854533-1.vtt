00:44.714 --> 00:46.615
[bird screeching faintly]

01:11.675 --> 01:13.543
DRIVER: But there was
something strange though,

01:13.578 --> 01:15.809
because a few months later,

01:15.844 --> 01:18.548
we were looking through
our wedding photographs

01:18.583 --> 01:21.551
and there was a picture
of myself and my wife

01:21.586 --> 01:23.223
at the front of the hotel.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.622
And you could see
just behind us,

01:26.657 --> 01:30.593
a figure of someone
looking out of the window.

01:31.464 --> 01:33.167
Staring at us.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.566
Really quite scary at the time.

01:36.601 --> 01:39.635
-Nobody you could account for?
-Absolutely nobody.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.472
-Oh, my goodness.
-And it turns out the room

01:41.507 --> 01:42.803
-was empty at the time.
-[gasps]

01:43.509 --> 01:44.805
DRIVER: So, I, uh...

01:44.840 --> 01:47.643
I avoid the place on dark
winter nights. [chuckles]

02:21.316 --> 02:23.217
[bell tolling]

02:43.932 --> 02:46.702
Mum, we're here.

02:46.737 --> 02:48.374
We've arrived.

03:00.916 --> 03:02.916
[computer keyboard clicking]

03:05.360 --> 03:07.954
WOMAN: Good evening.
We'd like to check in please.

03:07.989 --> 03:09.494
Yeah, no problem.

03:09.529 --> 03:11.265
-Uh, do you have a reservation?
-Yes.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.597
-Great. What's the name?
-Hart.

03:13.632 --> 03:14.433
Hart.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.306
[turning pages]

03:19.341 --> 03:20.736
RECEPTIONIST:   mm.

03:25.809 --> 03:27.281
When did you book?

03:27.316 --> 03:28.942
I was gonna say that I...

03:28.977 --> 03:32.011
made the reservation
um, several months ago.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.452
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I understand that.

03:33.487 --> 03:35.355
I'm just-- I'm just looking.

03:35.390 --> 03:36.620
Just... [sighs]

03:37.689 --> 03:39.491
-Several months ago you said?
-Yeah.

03:39.526 --> 03:41.361
-But I did ring last week...
-You did ring?

03:41.396 --> 03:43.022
-Okay.
-...to double check.

03:49.635 --> 03:51.305
-Ah, here you go.
-Yes.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.604
-Uh, Julie Hart, ground floor.
-That's right.

03:53.639 --> 03:55.837
-No. Well, no, uh...
-With wheelchair access.

03:55.872 --> 03:58.873
In fact, when I rang last week
it was to confirm that what we--

03:58.908 --> 04:01.513
what we've reserved
is the first floor,

04:01.548 --> 04:03.779
uh, facing the formal gardens.

04:03.814 --> 04:05.484
Uh, no. There's nothing
here on my side.

04:05.519 --> 04:07.651
Usually when people book
and they have a special request

04:07.686 --> 04:09.048
-it's attached to the booking.
-Uh-huh. Yes.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.523
Well, I imagine
he would have made a note of it.

04:11.558 --> 04:12.854
Can you check
with your colleague maybe?

04:12.889 --> 04:14.790
He's not here this evening.

04:14.825 --> 04:16.495
Or, maybe even your manager.

04:16.530 --> 04:19.498
-It's just me for tonight.
-[typing]

04:19.533 --> 04:21.401
But we're here tonight
and I reserved it.

04:21.436 --> 04:22.930
Yeah, I get that.
So, would you be happy to stay

04:22.965 --> 04:24.602
on the ground floor
just for tonight?

04:24.637 --> 04:28.001
No, I'm afraid not, because
I reserved a first floor room.

04:28.036 --> 04:31.070
Well I can't put you in a room
that I haven't got.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.808
[continues typing]

04:39.916 --> 04:41.520
A lot of keys there.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.018
Just one moment, please.

04:50.465 --> 04:51.629
I mean...

04:53.127 --> 04:55.798
I have one room that I can
give you just for tonight.

04:55.833 --> 04:59.571
-Oh.
-That is on the first floor.

04:59.606 --> 05:01.639
JULIE: Oh.
Oh, that's very good. Um...

05:03.709 --> 05:04.906
Well, maybe could I
see that room?

05:04.941 --> 05:06.479
Yeah, you wanna see the room?

05:06.514 --> 05:08.745
-Yes. Just check it out.
-I'll take you up.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.110
And there's Wi-Fi throughout
the hotel, is there?

05:11.145 --> 05:12.782
Uh, no, not throughout
the hotel.

05:12.817 --> 05:13.683
If you want some signal,

05:13.718 --> 05:15.719
best off going to the top
of the building.

05:20.121 --> 05:21.087
JULIE: I'm sorry,
I didn't understand.

05:21.122 --> 05:23.463
Did you say that there was Wi-Fi
on this floor?

05:23.498 --> 05:24.926
RECEPTIONIST: I mean,
there is Wi-Fi in the building,

05:24.961 --> 05:27.060
but you only get signal
when you go up to the top.

05:30.439 --> 05:33.099
JULIE: I did reserve a table
in the restaurant for dinner.

05:33.134 --> 05:35.574
RECEPTIONIST:   h, no, you were
late so everything's closed.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.550
-And here's your key. Thanks.
-Thank you.

05:44.585 --> 05:46.519
And as soon as possible
it would be good to know

05:46.554 --> 05:48.785
that we can be here
for the remaining nights.

05:48.820 --> 05:50.754
[door shuts]

05:57.697 --> 05:59.532
Oh, God!

06:16.617 --> 06:20.047
Getting our things in
a little bit of a muddle here.

06:21.017 --> 06:22.588
Just get it all.

06:23.723 --> 06:25.525
Here we are. Oops.

06:26.154 --> 06:27.890
Now, no peeking.

06:30.994 --> 06:33.533
[laughs] No, I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.508
[drawer shuts]

06:45.580 --> 06:46.975
Darling, don't you want
to take your coat off?

06:47.010 --> 06:48.647
You must be boiling.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.618
I just want
to get everything organized.

07:09.571 --> 07:11.472
MOTHER:
Oh, it's so good to be here.

07:11.837 --> 07:13.067
I remember the ceiling.

07:13.102 --> 07:15.201
[Julie zips luggage]

07:15.236 --> 07:18.105
And I think, uh,
I was in that bed.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.613
My sister was in this one.

07:24.949 --> 07:25.816
Look...

07:27.853 --> 07:31.283
Oh, darling. Oh, no!

07:31.318 --> 07:33.494

10:13.887 --> 10:16.085
All right, Mum. So, I'll see
if I can find a kettle.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.219
-All right?
-All right, darling.

10:18.254 --> 10:20.419
Louis, you stay here.
Stay with your mistress.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.827

-Good morning.

15:28.036 --> 15:30.333
-Just one or two things.
-Yeah?

15:30.368 --> 15:32.236
I'm wondering if there's any
clarity on whether or not

15:32.271 --> 15:36.339
we can stay in our room
for the next few nights.

15:36.374 --> 15:38.242
Um, I still don't know
about the room.

15:38.277 --> 15:41.773
Oh, there's no way of expediting
that decision is there?

15:41.808 --> 15:44.413
Uh, no. I can try and get back
to you later on today,

15:44.448 --> 15:45.744
but I can't promise anything.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.516
Sooner rather than later
would be much appreciated.

15:48.551 --> 15:50.122
Yep.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.684
Also, we don't seem
to have a kettle in our room.

15:51.719 --> 15:54.522
-An electric kettle, please.
-Yep, I'll bring one up.

15:54.557 --> 15:57.558
And, also, I had
a very unsettled night.

15:57.593 --> 15:59.296
There was a sound.

15:59.331 --> 16:01.265
I'm sure other people
have mentioned it to you.

16:01.300 --> 16:06.105
A banging of some kind.
I imagine it was a window or...

16:06.140 --> 16:09.141
Yeah. I mean, there's
no one staying above you.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.770
Well, exactly.
I can't imagine anybody

16:11.805 --> 16:13.772
would have been staying
in a room with that

16:13.807 --> 16:16.511
because they wouldn't have
been able to sleep at all.

16:16.546 --> 16:18.612
It was... And I don't know
if it was a window,

16:18.647 --> 16:22.781
but it felt repetitive and...
Yeah, all night.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.015
That's strange,
'cause nobody else

16:24.051 --> 16:26.554
has mentioned anything at all
about any noise whatsoever.

16:26.589 --> 16:27.687
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:27.722 --> 16:30.294
That does surprise me.
It was pervasive.

16:30.329 --> 16:33.594
Oh, well, anyway, um...
I would be very grateful

16:33.629 --> 16:36.069
if you could make sure that
doesn't happen again tonight,

16:36.104 --> 16:38.137
and check all the windows and...

16:38.634 --> 16:39.567
All the windows?

16:41.109 --> 16:42.108
Well, all the windows--

16:42.144 --> 16:43.343
Especially in the rooms
that are not occupied,

16:43.378 --> 16:47.179
because, obviously, the people
who are staying in the rooms

16:47.214 --> 16:49.181
will be able to check
their own windows.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.446
Yep.

16:50.481 --> 16:52.415
I also have a message for you,
by the way.

16:55.453 --> 16:57.123
Your cousin...

16:58.621 --> 16:59.719
Alistair.

17:01.261 --> 17:03.756
He wants you to go to lunch
with him on Sunday.

17:03.791 --> 17:06.594
Oh, thank you very much.

17:06.629 --> 17:10.169
So, lovely to hear
that we can stay in our room.

17:11.139 --> 17:13.535
The checking of the windows...

17:14.274 --> 17:15.669
...and, uh, and the kettle.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.375
-Yeah, I'll bring the kettle up.
-Thank you.

17:18.410 --> 17:19.739
-No problem.
-Thank you.

17:29.553 --> 17:31.190
We don't want to go do we?

17:31.225 --> 17:34.094
Just tell me,
what would you prefer?

17:34.822 --> 17:36.492
Well, what do you feel?

17:36.527 --> 17:38.395
No, Mum.
I want us to do what you want.

17:39.431 --> 17:41.794
Oh, well I feel so awful
to say it, but...

17:42.863 --> 17:44.401
It's not that I don't want
to see them, but I mean,

17:44.436 --> 17:46.304
we're so cozy here, aren't we?

17:46.339 --> 17:49.472
Yeah, I mean it's very selfish,
but I was rather hoping...

17:50.541 --> 17:52.706
...we could be together.

17:52.741 --> 17:56.215
If you can think
of a nice way of saying it,

17:56.250 --> 17:57.843
I think it would be
really wonderful

17:57.878 --> 18:01.187
-if we could just be us.
-Very good. I'll call him later.

18:01.222 --> 18:03.750
I think that would be...
I think that would be the best.

18:09.626 --> 18:11.230
You having a nice breakfast?

18:12.365 --> 18:14.200
Very, very good marmalade.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.207
So I'm gonna go and make a start
on my work.

18:21.242 --> 18:22.406
Are you all right?

18:22.441 --> 18:24.177
I'm perfectly fine,
thank you, darling.

18:24.212 --> 18:26.311
I'm just gonna take my time
and then I'm gonna have a bath.

18:27.215 --> 18:28.511
Do you want me
to run it for you?

18:28.546 --> 18:30.480
-Mm.
-Really?

18:31.780 --> 18:33.747
No, don't worry. I'll be fine.

18:36.818 --> 18:38.455
You found a nice place to work?

18:39.854 --> 18:43.328
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
I'm gonna give it a stab anyway.

It's not a problem...

Are we the only people
staying here?

20:56.892 --> 20:58.529
Have you worked that out yet?

20:58.564 --> 20:59.959
I know... I don't know. I...

21:01.061 --> 21:02.863
There was no-one here
when I arrived.

21:02.898 --> 21:03.864
Oh, look at that.

21:05.472 --> 21:06.570
Thank you very much.

21:07.639 --> 21:08.869
That's very welcome.

21:14.008 --> 21:15.007
Are you ready to order?

21:16.483 --> 21:17.812
Oh, I do apologize.

21:18.518 --> 21:19.880
Haven't even had a look.

21:21.950 --> 21:25.050
Uh, not quite,
I just, uh... gosh.

21:25.085 --> 21:27.019
Shall I come back
in a couple of minutes or...

I'm, um... I'm a bit torn
between the soup...

21:50.847 --> 21:52.418
A carrot and coriander soup,

21:52.453 --> 21:54.420
and the beetroot salad
sounds very nice.

21:55.489 --> 21:58.721
Yeah, "Salad of heritage
beetroot, apple and Welsh feta."

21:58.756 --> 22:01.559
Such... So nice when it's local.

22:01.594 --> 22:02.989
I mean, I suppose
we could have...

22:03.992 --> 22:05.629
...different things
on different nights.

22:09.096 --> 22:10.370
RECEPTIONIST:
Have you decided?

22:13.672 --> 22:14.770
There's only four options.

22:15.971 --> 22:18.037
I think I'll have the, um...

22:18.072 --> 22:20.677
Yeah, I think I'll have
the beetroot salad to start.

22:20.712 --> 22:22.140
-And then, uh...
-A main?

22:22.175 --> 22:24.450
Yes and then followed
by the salmon.

22:24.485 --> 22:27.046
-[pen scribbling]
-Yeah.

22:27.081 --> 22:28.850
MOTHER: And I'll have
the same, please.

22:30.018 --> 22:31.523
The beetroot salad...

22:35.958 --> 22:37.397
...and the salmon.

22:40.061 --> 22:41.599
-I'll bring it over.
-JULIE: Thank you.

22:52.073 --> 22:53.644
MOTHER: Darling,
will you stop doing that?

22:53.679 --> 22:56.174
You must, must have enough
photographs of me by now.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.978
-JULIE: Well, I gotcha.
-[sighs]

22:58.915 --> 23:00.112

23:05.823 --> 23:07.460
Oh, just...

23:11.059 --> 23:12.531
...things to go through.

23:14.634 --> 23:16.062
Letters and, um...

23:16.097 --> 23:19.065
and papers and photographs
and, uh...

23:19.100 --> 23:20.605
Maybe there's...

23:22.268 --> 23:24.576
stuff in it that...
that I would...

23:25.810 --> 23:28.910
...value... that maybe
you wouldn't.

23:28.945 --> 23:30.714
Well, I'm sure
you're very interested.

23:30.749 --> 23:33.618
I can...
I can sense your interest.

23:34.522 --> 23:35.521
I'm sure you think you're

23:35.557 --> 23:37.754
going to want to
put it in a film at some point.

23:37.789 --> 23:39.217
Let's just have a nice dinner.

23:41.859 --> 23:44.189
-[bell tolling]
-Do you remember this room?

23:44.224 --> 23:46.466
Yes, this was--
this was the drawing room.

23:48.701 --> 23:51.669
And, uh... big, big sofas here.

23:53.035 --> 23:54.639
Velvet ones.

23:56.973 --> 23:57.972
Yeah.

23:59.613 --> 24:02.779
And us children would jump
off the back of it.

24:06.587 --> 24:08.521
We would jump from one
to the other.

24:09.216 --> 24:11.051
See if we could make it.

24:11.086 --> 24:12.888
Over a dog preferably.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.188
Mm...

24:16.795 --> 24:18.223
Did you have a good day,
darling?

24:19.600 --> 24:21.996
Not great actually. Um...

24:24.066 --> 24:25.637
Couldn't really get started.

24:27.003 --> 24:28.772
I mean, I didn't sleep...

24:29.269 --> 24:30.906
for a start and, uh...

24:32.745 --> 24:35.108
I dunno. I'm, I'm...

24:37.046 --> 24:39.277

25:56.059 --> 25:57.993
Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry.

25:58.028 --> 26:00.028
I couldn't get a message
to you either.

26:00.063 --> 26:01.964
Um... But, uh...

26:03.770 --> 26:06.639

it'll come, I suppose.

But, uh, it...
Oh, hang on, what's that...

26:17.982 --> 26:20.983
Hello? Hello?
Oh, that's a bit better.

26:21.018 --> 26:23.953
Yeah, I'm just gonna stand

You're an angel.

34:40.616 --> 34:42.550
I feel terrible taking you away
from your work like this.

34:42.585 --> 34:46.158
Oh, no. I'll do it later.
This is a nice job.

34:46.193 --> 34:47.555
Well, it's a great help.

34:47.590 --> 34:50.195
I mean, I have a pile and
I really want to get them away

34:50.230 --> 34:51.592
as soon as possible.

34:51.627 --> 34:53.462
Maybe after lunch
we could post them.

34:56.566 --> 34:58.269
Do you want to take one
of my little helpers?

34:59.437 --> 35:02.306
I don't want to get dependent
on anything, so...

35:02.341 --> 35:05.474
I-- I understand, but just--
just say the word.

35:05.509 --> 35:08.213
I have them you know,
and I find they're marvelous.

35:08.248 --> 35:10.314
They just--
You know, I go straight off.

35:10.349 --> 35:13.812
No, I'll go for a longer walk
today and I don't know...

35:13.847 --> 35:16.617
maybe drink less coffee.
I don't know. Anyway...

35:16.652 --> 35:17.915
All right, so I've done
the Asbury's.

35:17.950 --> 35:21.952
I've done Anne and
Michael Saxton-Thomas.

35:21.987 --> 35:24.724
Um... uh...

35:25.694 --> 35:29.366
Oh, uh, yes, Charles Stowe.

35:29.401 --> 35:30.895
Did I tell you that Molly died?

35:31.832 --> 35:32.897
So sad.

35:33.702 --> 35:35.801
He was so sweet when,
you know,

35:35.836 --> 35:38.771
when he wrote me
such a lovely letter.

35:38.806 --> 35:41.411
All right, uh,
let's get on with that.

35:46.979 --> 35:49.551
With an "E" and "Esquire."

35:50.950 --> 35:53.456
And you'll find the address
in there.

35:59.794 --> 36:01.497
So nice by the fire.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.269
Do you remember this room?

36:04.304 --> 36:06.337
Was it like this
when you were here before?

36:06.867 --> 36:08.735
Uh, do you know,
I was just thinking.

36:08.770 --> 36:13.872
I remember the fireplace
very well. Um...

36:13.907 --> 36:15.808
I remember being rather
frightened of it actually,

36:15.843 --> 36:17.612
uh, when I was...

36:18.714 --> 36:20.582
Yeah, I mean,
it's so funny isn't it,

36:20.617 --> 36:22.980
to think that one
would be frightened, but I...

36:23.015 --> 36:26.225
Although, I have happy memories
of this room.

36:26.854 --> 36:31.560
Um, I think, uh, you know,
Aunt Jocelyn was, um...

36:32.860 --> 36:34.893
...always filling it
with children.

36:34.928 --> 36:38.567
And, uh, didn't have
any of her own,

36:38.602 --> 36:40.470
but she, you know,
she took us in

36:40.505 --> 36:44.738
and she took the cousins,
and yeah...

36:45.939 --> 36:47.642
Happy times.

36:47.677 --> 36:50.348
And... I mean,
did you, did you--

36:50.383 --> 36:51.877
Were you aware
of the war going on?

36:51.912 --> 36:53.978
Did you have bombers
going over or...?

36:54.013 --> 36:56.750
Yeah... Well, I mean, you're not
far from Liverpool here,

36:56.785 --> 36:59.258
so yeah there-- [exhales]
there were...

37:01.691 --> 37:03.020
Darling, let's get on
with these cards.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.494
-I mean, I--
-All right.

37:04.529 --> 37:06.793
Can we? Do you mind?
Let's-- I'm--

37:06.828 --> 37:08.696
The truth is I feel
a bit wobbly today, so I just--

37:08.731 --> 37:09.763
Oh, Mum!

37:10.832 --> 37:13.635
No, just I dunno,
I just feel a bit sort of cold,

37:13.670 --> 37:15.373
even though we're by the fire.

37:15.408 --> 37:17.573
You look a bit cold.
Oh, would you like a scarf?

37:17.608 --> 37:19.608
-I'll go and get you a scarf.
-No, well don't--

37:19.643 --> 37:21.445
-Yeah. No, easy.
-I can do it darling.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.040

JULIE: Mm.

39:55.667 --> 39:57.832
Didn't get any
work done today.

39:57.867 --> 40:00.505
Maybe it'll just take
a little time.

40:14.653 --> 40:15.916
MOTHER: This was, um...

40:17.755 --> 40:19.821
This is a room
I remember very well.

40:19.856 --> 40:22.692
Um... it was a drawing room.

40:22.727 --> 40:23.627
[clears throat]

40:23.662 --> 40:24.760
And, uh...

40:28.128 --> 40:30.502
It was hung with tapestries.

40:30.537 --> 40:33.472
I mean, real tapestries, not
what they have now but, um...

40:34.871 --> 40:36.070
And, uh...

40:37.973 --> 40:41.480
It had a needlepoint fireguard,
which my Aunt Joss had made.

40:44.980 --> 40:46.078
We had it for a while.

40:48.247 --> 40:50.115
-I don't know where it is now.
-[footsteps approaching]

40:51.591 --> 40:54.658
The telephone was in this room,
and my aunt...

40:54.693 --> 40:56.528
There was this one day
when my aunt, um...

40:56.563 --> 40:58.563
-[kicks plastic bag]
-There's a bag on the floor.

41:03.669 --> 41:06.703
-Finished?
-Um... yeah. Yeah, okay.

41:07.772 --> 41:09.673
-I'll bring in the main.
-Thank you.

41:11.006 --> 41:12.236
Um...

41:14.009 --> 41:16.614
And I remember her voice,
particularly.

41:17.914 --> 41:18.980
Very low.

41:20.950 --> 41:25.788
Oh, my cousins and I were
mucking about on the stairs,

41:25.823 --> 41:29.858
and... and she
came out of the room

41:29.893 --> 41:32.058
and made an absolute
beeline for me,

41:32.093 --> 41:35.930
with this very serious look
on her face.

41:35.965 --> 41:42.101
Which was rare, 'cause she was
a very merry soul generally.

41:42.873 --> 41:43.872
Um...

41:45.777 --> 41:47.975
-Mm.
-[faint creaking]

41:48.010 --> 41:49.174
And there'd been this...

41:51.112 --> 41:52.914
...news about Peter.

41:54.819 --> 41:58.887
His, uh, plane had been lost
over the English Channel.

41:59.956 --> 42:03.221
Yeah. And, um...

42:05.390 --> 42:08.699
Mummy and Daddy
had the funeral in London

42:08.734 --> 42:11.361
and they thought it best that
we stay here with Aunt Joss,

42:11.396 --> 42:14.067
which we did. Um...

42:15.301 --> 42:17.037
We went to the beach.

42:20.075 --> 42:24.913
And my brothers, my...
my older brothers... they went.

42:24.948 --> 42:26.750
They were old enough to go.

42:27.346 --> 42:28.851
Mum, I'm so sorry.

42:30.019 --> 42:31.887
Oh, darling, no.

42:31.922 --> 42:33.152
I didn't know.

42:35.090 --> 42:37.123
I feel so bad
for bringing you here.

42:38.225 --> 42:39.697
That's what rooms do.

42:39.732 --> 42:42.667
They, they hold
these stories and...

42:44.704 --> 42:46.297
We're here now.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.267
And that was then.

42:49.302 --> 42:53.810
And, and there's just this
muddle in me,

42:53.845 --> 42:57.275
of when-- when it is, exactly.

42:57.310 --> 42:59.343
-That's all.
-Well you always said

42:59.378 --> 43:02.049
you had such happy memories here
and that's why I thought...

43:03.690 --> 43:06.317
Oh, darling I did--
I did have happy memories here.

43:07.859 --> 43:10.090
But I also had
other memories here.

43:12.732 --> 43:14.732
I had all sorts
of memories here.

43:16.736 --> 43:19.704
-And they, they...
-[footsteps approaching]

43:19.739 --> 43:21.398
You know,
they're all still alive.

43:26.273 --> 43:28.977
-[sets down plate]
-Battered cod.

43:29.012 --> 43:30.110
Kitchen's closing soon.

43:30.981 --> 43:32.046
Thank you.

43:33.149 --> 43:35.412
That's quite a helping.
Could you help me with this?

43:35.447 --> 43:37.216
I'm not sure that I could
manage all of that.

43:37.251 --> 43:40.758
[laughing] Oh, no, Mum!
Look how much I've got.

43:40.793 --> 43:42.958
Just leave it
if you can't eat it.

43:42.993 --> 43:44.861
I don't see a fish knife,
either.

43:45.831 --> 43:48.062
Yeah, I don't know which one
we're supposed to use.

43:53.872 --> 43:56.037
[quietly]
All right, let's see...

43:56.072 --> 43:58.237
[cutting food]

44:00.978 --> 44:03.440
-I feel so bad.
-For what, my darling?

44:04.014 --> 44:05.717
To bring you back to a place

44:05.752 --> 44:07.983
which you have such
sad memories about. I mean...

44:09.118 --> 44:10.887
I'm-- I'm really sorry.

44:10.922 --> 44:12.317
I wanted to come.

44:12.352 --> 44:14.187
I'm so grateful to you
for bringing me.

44:15.454 --> 44:17.729
This is a--
this is a lovely thing

44:17.764 --> 44:19.192
for us to be here together.

44:19.227 --> 44:20.897
JULIE: I... I...

44:22.296 --> 44:24.098
I feel really bad
for coming now.

44:24.133 --> 44:25.363
It's not your fault.

44:26.905 --> 44:28.740
Mum, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

44:28.775 --> 44:30.269
[voice trembling]
I'm so sorry.

44:32.273 --> 44:35.747
[cutlery clicking]

44:35.782 --> 44:36.979
Nothing's your fault.

44:38.081 --> 44:39.751
[Julie stifles sob]

44:43.856 --> 44:45.152
Mmm.

44:52.425 --> 44:54.128
[Julie sniffles]

44:54.163 --> 44:56.394
[crying]

45:02.941 --> 45:04.303
MOTHER: I don't know.

45:07.847 --> 45:09.176
I mean, it's not like any of us

45:09.211 --> 45:10.749
could have done anything
to stop it.

45:12.049 --> 45:14.313
So you just have to take it,
don't you?

45:21.223 --> 45:23.025
You know, you can't regret it

45:23.060 --> 45:26.930
because you didn't have
any say in it.

45:29.330 --> 45:30.428
[voice shaking] Mm.

45:34.236 --> 45:36.533
I mean, that's what life's like.

45:36.568 --> 45:37.908
Just...

45:43.311 --> 45:47.885
You know,
you roll with the punches.

45:59.327 --> 46:02.097
[muffled techno music thumping]

46:07.368 --> 46:09.335
RECEPTIONIST: Why haven't you
been answering your phone?

46:09.370 --> 46:11.568
[footfalls on drive]

46:11.603 --> 46:12.910
Why haven't you
been answering--

46:12.945 --> 46:14.241
Alfie!

46:15.981 --> 46:18.113
What's wrong with you?

46:18.148 --> 46:19.950
Why you driving off?!

46:21.052 --> 46:22.854
What is wrong with you?

46:22.889 --> 46:24.889
What is wrong with you?

46:41.303 --> 46:43.402
[car revving]

47:05.558 --> 47:07.492
[light thump]

47:22.311 --> 47:24.949
Oh, there you are. I'm so sorry.
It's even later this time.

47:25.578 --> 47:29.019
Um... how are you?

47:32.519 --> 47:35.223
Yeah, sorry, it's not very good.
Let me just go over here.

47:36.963 --> 47:39.359
I think it's kind of best
up against the hedge.

47:39.394 --> 47:41.295
[light chuckle]

47:42.496 --> 47:44.496
Oh, oh, um...

47:44.531 --> 47:47.268
Oh, I don't know, I'm actually
having a kind of bad day.

47:47.303 --> 47:50.337
I'm having doubts
about the whole project.

47:50.372 --> 47:52.042
[Louis whimpers]

47:53.177 --> 47:55.012
I don't know,
I just feel so guilty.

48:00.514 --> 48:02.349
[sighs]
I can't really explain it.

48:02.384 --> 48:04.516
I mean, it's got something to do
with being here, but...

48:07.323 --> 48:08.421
[sighs]

48:09.325 --> 48:11.490
Oh, anyway, I...

48:11.525 --> 48:14.460
Darling, you know, it's actually
really cold out here.

48:14.495 --> 48:16.462
I think I'm gonna have to go in
and get Louis in.

48:16.497 --> 48:20.004
So, uh, I'll call you tomorrow
when I can, okay?

48:20.039 --> 48:21.467
I hope it'll be earlier.

48:21.502 --> 48:24.668
What? Hello?

48:31.545 --> 48:33.380
[wind blowing]

48:36.418 --> 48:39.056
[faint thumping outside]

48:42.127 --> 48:43.456
Are you all right, darling?

48:47.462 --> 48:49.363
I'm fine, Mum. I won't be long.

48:50.366 --> 48:52.036
You've been an awful long time.

48:54.403 --> 48:57.272
[pill box rattling]

49:09.088 --> 49:11.319
[Louis panting lightly]

49:13.455 --> 49:15.290
-[exhales]
-[Louis whimpers]

49:15.325 --> 49:16.555
Yes, my boy.

49:18.460 --> 49:20.691
[sighs]

49:20.726 --> 49:23.067
[window rattling]

49:29.174 --> 49:31.075
[bag rustling]

49:40.647 --> 49:42.581
[hinges creaking]

49:42.616 --> 49:44.517
[Louis whimpers]

49:47.456 --> 49:49.159
[light whimper]

49:51.328 --> 49:53.295
[panting]

50:05.507 --> 50:07.243
There we...

50:13.317 --> 50:14.448
Louis?

50:23.195 --> 50:25.360
[wind blowing]

50:25.395 --> 50:28.825
Louis! Louis?

50:33.337 --> 50:35.271
-Louis!
-[distant animal calling]

50:37.506 --> 50:41.376
Louis! Louis?

50:41.411 --> 50:43.774
[wind moaning]

50:43.809 --> 50:45.479
Louis!

50:47.318 --> 50:48.647
Louis!

50:50.849 --> 50:52.387
Louis!

50:52.422 --> 50:54.587
[bell tolling]

51:04.236 --> 51:07.699
Louis! Louis?

51:07.734 --> 51:09.140
MAN: Are you all right?

51:09.175 --> 51:11.604
JULIE: Oh! I'm so sorry.
My-- my mother's dog.

51:11.639 --> 51:14.178
He's vanished. I don't know
where he's gone.

51:14.213 --> 51:16.147
MAN:
I'm sure he's not far away.

51:16.182 --> 51:17.346
JULIE: Louis!

51:18.316 --> 51:20.448
[bell continues tolling]

51:26.555 --> 51:28.390
JULIE: Louis!

51:29.624 --> 51:31.822
-Here, boy!
-Louis!

51:32.759 --> 51:36.431
JULIE: Come Louis! Come!

51:43.473 --> 51:44.802
Louis?

51:51.382 --> 51:53.712
[croaking bird call]

51:55.881 --> 51:57.419
Louis?

52:00.688 --> 52:03.194
[gravel crunching underfoot]

52:23.480 --> 52:24.677
Louis?

52:30.949 --> 52:33.620
-[gasps] Oh! Oh.
-[whimpers]

52:34.821 --> 52:38.229
[quietly] Now, you stay there.
Stay. Don't move.

52:42.829 --> 52:44.730
[lamps buzzing fitfully]

53:17.468 --> 53:18.797
I wanted to tell you,
he's found!

53:18.832 --> 53:19.963
-[Julie laughs]
-Oh, good!

53:19.998 --> 53:21.635
And to thank you so much
for your help.

53:21.670 --> 53:22.502
You're most welcome.

53:22.538 --> 53:24.407
No, I feel awful
for having involved you.

53:24.442 --> 53:26.277
Oh, it's perfectly all right.

53:26.312 --> 53:28.411
So grateful. Thank you.

53:29.348 --> 53:31.414
Well, we should celebrate.
Why don't you have a seat?

53:32.813 --> 53:34.813
Well if...
if I'm not disturbing you.

53:34.848 --> 53:36.584
-No.
-That would be lovely.

53:36.619 --> 53:38.487
-Thank you.
-I'll be with you in a moment.

53:38.522 --> 53:39.554
Thank you.

53:40.854 --> 53:42.359
I'm so sorry.

53:42.394 --> 53:43.822
Don't be.

53:43.857 --> 53:46.022
He's back. He's safe.

53:46.057 --> 53:47.694
-[sniffs] Yeah.
-Cheers.

53:47.729 --> 53:48.893
[laughs] Cheers.

53:48.928 --> 53:50.532
-[chuckles]
-I'm Julie.

53:51.370 --> 53:52.963
I'm Bill.

53:52.998 --> 53:54.470
-William...
-Yes.

53:54.505 --> 53:55.768
Was my father's name.

53:55.803 --> 53:57.440
-Ah...
-Mm.

53:59.741 --> 54:01.873
-He's no longer with us?
-No.

54:01.908 --> 54:05.041
He, um... he died
a couple of years ago.

54:05.076 --> 54:06.713
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:08.684 --> 54:10.816
My wife died about a year ago.

54:10.851 --> 54:13.016
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-She worked here.

54:13.051 --> 54:15.524
-She was the chef.
-Oh.

54:15.559 --> 54:20.892
We had about thirty some years
working in this place together.

54:23.094 --> 54:25.666
And, um...

54:25.701 --> 54:29.802
I could have retired,
but I decided to stay on.

54:30.805 --> 54:32.640
Pretty much because of my wife.

54:34.380 --> 54:36.512
And the memories that we have
of working here.

54:38.549 --> 54:41.044
You might have heard me
playing the flute.

54:41.079 --> 54:45.620
Um... something that I picked up

54:45.655 --> 54:48.425
shortly after she died.

54:48.460 --> 54:54.398
And so I sit in the office or in
the kitchen and I play for her.

54:54.433 --> 54:56.631
Because I never played
for her before.

54:58.063 --> 55:02.934
And, um, so it's like a new
chapter in our relationship.

55:11.912 --> 55:13.109
And what do you do?

55:14.519 --> 55:16.816
-I'm a filmmaker and I came...
-Ahh.

55:16.851 --> 55:21.018
I came here, um,
with my mother to, um...

55:23.528 --> 55:28.157
...to try and write a film
about my mother and I.

55:28.192 --> 55:29.466
Ah.

55:30.832 --> 55:33.470
But not easy.

55:33.505 --> 55:36.539
Uh... I-- I can't even
get started.

55:36.574 --> 55:38.541
[murmurs]

55:38.576 --> 55:39.938
Why is that?

55:42.580 --> 55:43.843
[exhales]

55:46.683 --> 55:47.946
I...

55:50.181 --> 55:53.622
I think I'm not sure I feel
I have a right...

55:56.495 --> 55:58.495
...to do such a thing.

56:05.801 --> 56:07.801
It feels like trespassing.

56:11.774 --> 56:15.743
It's really difficult for me
to think of her being sad.

56:21.817 --> 56:24.455
You know,
I want her to be happy.

56:24.490 --> 56:26.622
I just want her to be happy
all the time.

56:34.225 --> 56:36.995
There are memories
here that I...

56:37.030 --> 56:40.966
...um, have with my wife
that are not happy.

56:42.002 --> 56:43.199
Um...

56:43.773 --> 56:45.575
I make my rounds.

56:46.039 --> 56:48.072
And, of course...

56:48.107 --> 56:52.879
that's the time when memories
flood back to me.

56:52.914 --> 56:56.817
And I make my rounds
quietly in the evening.

56:56.852 --> 56:59.721
Through the building and
on the grounds.

56:59.756 --> 57:04.660
And I suppose it is a way of
staying in touch with my wife.

57:06.092 --> 57:07.861
So I can understand

57:07.896 --> 57:11.535
you wanting to make a film
about your mother to...

57:14.738 --> 57:18.806
...keep that sense
of that relationship with her.

57:22.713 --> 57:24.548
It's difficult, isn't it?

57:29.687 --> 57:32.149
And I really am
so very, very grateful to you

57:32.184 --> 57:33.953
-for all your kindness.
-Oh, you're most welcome.

57:33.988 --> 57:36.021
You've really been
a great, great help.

57:36.056 --> 57:39.057
I wonder, tomorrow, before
my mother's birthday dinner,

57:39.092 --> 57:41.290
we're, we're going to have
a drink to toast her,

57:41.325 --> 57:43.061
and I wondered if you'd like
to join us?

57:43.096 --> 57:46.295
Oh, that's awfully kind of you,
but I have family business,

57:46.330 --> 57:48.066
so I won't be
around tomorrow evening.

57:48.101 --> 57:50.134
-But thank you so much.
-Not at all, I just...

57:50.169 --> 57:52.004
-It was a thought. [chuckles]
-Good night.

57:52.039 --> 57:53.203
-Good night.
-Rest well.

57:53.238 --> 57:54.809
Thank you.

1:00:56.388 --> 1:01:00.797
[singsong] Happy Birthday!

1:02:48.467 --> 1:02:49.939
[Louis whimpers]

1:02:58.983 --> 1:03:00.884
There was a time when, uh...

1:03:03.218 --> 1:03:08.089
when... when we hoped that--
that they might, uh...

1:03:08.124 --> 1:03:09.926
But, uh, but no.

1:03:12.062 --> 1:03:14.227
-And now she has her work.
-Mm.

1:03:14.262 --> 1:03:17.494
And she makes her films,
and they are...

1:03:20.004 --> 1:03:24.237
...as time consuming, uh,
and as energy consuming

1:03:24.272 --> 1:03:27.075
I would suggest,
as a... as a child might be.

1:03:27.110 --> 1:03:30.111
-Oh, yes. Mm.
-Each one as they come along.

1:03:30.146 --> 1:03:32.311
-Yes.
-Um... Yeah, I mean, uh...

1:03:33.952 --> 1:03:37.954
I'm... I'm sad for her
that she doesn't have a child,

1:03:37.989 --> 1:03:42.057
because I think
she would have... uh...

1:03:42.092 --> 1:03:44.158
I was going to say she would
have been a wonderful mother,

1:03:44.193 --> 1:03:46.457
but the truth is,
she is a wonderful mother.

1:03:46.492 --> 1:03:50.164
-Mm.
-She has a great capacity for...

1:03:51.695 --> 1:03:53.662
...practical, the practical
magic of love.

1:03:53.697 --> 1:03:56.302
-Yes.
-You know, she does it well.

1:03:56.337 --> 1:03:59.173
-Yes.
-And I'm, these days,

1:03:59.208 --> 1:04:00.372
very much the recipient.

1:04:00.407 --> 1:04:01.978
Well, I've always
been the recipient.

1:04:02.013 --> 1:04:04.409
-[Bill laughs]
-But particularly now that, uh,

1:04:04.444 --> 1:04:07.643
that her father's left us.

1:04:07.678 --> 1:04:11.922
She's, um...
diligent to a degree.

1:04:11.957 --> 1:04:14.485
-BILL: And looks up to you.
-Yes, she really does.

1:04:15.653 --> 1:04:17.686
Oh, darling,
I want you to do me a favor,

1:04:17.721 --> 1:04:20.194
and if you see me nod off,

1:04:20.229 --> 1:04:22.064
I want you to give me a nudge.

1:04:23.562 --> 1:04:25.067
Don't you want to go to sleep?

1:04:26.004 --> 1:04:27.300
No, I don't want to go to sleep.

1:04:28.974 --> 1:04:30.369
Don't you want to have
a nice nap?

1:04:30.404 --> 1:04:33.944
Oh, I don't know, it's just
yesterday, after lunch,

1:04:33.979 --> 1:04:37.277
I dropped off and I...
it was like this kind of...

1:04:38.379 --> 1:04:40.049
Can't really explain it.
Sort of dread.

1:04:40.645 --> 1:04:42.051
What kind of dread?

1:04:43.483 --> 1:04:45.120
Being here. I mean...

1:04:47.993 --> 1:04:50.059
There's no question there are...

1:04:50.094 --> 1:04:52.556
[sighs deeply]

1:04:52.591 --> 1:04:55.999
um... you know...

1:04:57.695 --> 1:05:01.037
...all sorts of memories
popping up.

1:05:03.107 --> 1:05:04.942
It's inevitable I suppose.

1:05:07.243 --> 1:05:08.946
You know, even in this room.

1:05:10.774 --> 1:05:12.114
So many.

1:05:14.481 --> 1:05:15.678
JULIE: What sort of memories?

1:05:19.123 --> 1:05:21.453
Well, I mean, you know,

1:05:21.488 --> 1:05:26.227
the longer we're here,
the... the more it comes back.

1:05:27.494 --> 1:05:29.395
You know, the times
I've been here.

1:05:33.071 --> 1:05:34.466
When, when I...

1:05:36.305 --> 1:05:40.109
...came to visit... Aunt Joss.

1:05:41.508 --> 1:05:44.179
Not just when I was a child,
but later.

1:05:48.614 --> 1:05:49.987
What sort of memory?

1:05:50.715 --> 1:05:52.220
You know, when I was, um...

1:05:55.225 --> 1:05:56.719
when I, when I was, uh...

1:05:59.493 --> 1:06:01.526
...when I was expecting
that baby.

1:06:02.628 --> 1:06:04.100
Oh, yes.

1:06:05.598 --> 1:06:07.103
I was here.

1:06:08.370 --> 1:06:11.536
Oh, Mum. I had no idea.

1:06:11.571 --> 1:06:15.144
Yeah, well, no, I mean,
you know, how could you darling?

1:06:15.179 --> 1:06:17.476
But, uh, I mean, I...

1:06:20.217 --> 1:06:22.217
...virtually
forgotten it myself.

1:06:25.090 --> 1:06:28.124
But, you know, I was thinking,
you know, it was...

1:06:28.159 --> 1:06:30.291
It was around about
this time of year.

1:06:32.460 --> 1:06:33.591
And, um...

1:06:34.396 --> 1:06:36.693
[wind moaning softly]

1:06:39.797 --> 1:06:42.435
Yeah, I mean...
[inhales through teeth]

1:06:43.669 --> 1:06:45.372
And I was in this room.

1:06:49.477 --> 1:06:51.609
And we'd been for a walk.

1:06:51.644 --> 1:06:55.448
Too long... I think.

1:06:56.781 --> 1:06:59.551
Yeah. And, um...

1:07:01.654 --> 1:07:03.060
And I started to bleed.

1:07:03.623 --> 1:07:04.787
Oh.

1:07:04.822 --> 1:07:08.131
I was here without Daddy,
but then...

1:07:09.398 --> 1:07:11.530
I was taken to hospital,
and, um...

1:07:12.500 --> 1:07:14.500
when he came there...

1:07:16.438 --> 1:07:18.240
the thing I can't
stop thinking about

1:07:18.275 --> 1:07:20.077
was I wasn't very nice to him.

1:07:25.513 --> 1:07:26.842
Oh, Mum.

1:07:29.616 --> 1:07:31.715
I mean, in the circumstances...

1:07:32.850 --> 1:07:34.751
I was really
quite horrid, actually.

1:07:54.476 --> 1:07:56.542
Daddy would have understood.

1:07:56.577 --> 1:07:58.181
He would have understood.

1:08:06.422 --> 1:08:07.652
Mum?

1:08:10.558 --> 1:08:11.788
Mum?

1:08:22.768 --> 1:08:25.175
[knock on door]

1:08:33.548 --> 1:08:36.351
-Hello?
-Hi. Your cousin's downstairs.

1:08:37.486 --> 1:08:38.385
-Alistair.
-He's here?

1:08:38.421 --> 1:08:40.487
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Mum, Alistair's here.

1:08:40.522 --> 1:08:41.851
[chuckling] Darling!

1:08:42.887 --> 1:08:44.227
Didn't you call him back?

1:08:44.262 --> 1:08:46.229
Oh, well, uh...
oh, that's a surprise.

1:08:46.264 --> 1:08:47.593
Could you-- could you tell him
that I'll be down in a second?

1:08:47.628 --> 1:08:48.891
-Yeah, okay.
-Thank you very much.

1:08:48.926 --> 1:08:51.828
-[laughing]
-What shall I do?

1:08:51.863 --> 1:08:53.830
Oh that's awful. Well you must
go and get rid of him.

1:08:53.865 --> 1:08:56.899
Get rid of him.
I... okay. Oh, my God!

1:08:56.934 --> 1:08:58.769

1:08:58.804 --> 1:09:00.936
-Take Louis.
-Come on, come with me. Come on.

-Yeah.

1:09:12.752 --> 1:09:14.884
-Another film?
-Yes, another film.

1:09:14.919 --> 1:09:16.358
Another film.

1:09:16.393 --> 1:09:17.821
So look, I've bought these.

1:09:17.856 --> 1:09:19.757
I know it's, uh,
Rosalind's birthday.

1:09:19.792 --> 1:09:22.859
Oh, no, you remembered.

1:09:22.894 --> 1:09:25.796
That is so touching.

1:09:25.831 --> 1:09:27.666
-Um, thank--
-Hope you have a lovely day.

1:09:27.701 --> 1:09:30.570
She will be thrilled.

1:09:30.605 --> 1:09:32.374
We're having a really
lovely celebratory day.

you're not coming with us.

Oh, I don't know.
What do you think?

Well what about the one
on your plate.

All right. What can that be?

1:15:15.983 --> 1:15:18.984
Yeah, we can...
Yeah, we can order later.

1:15:20.218 --> 1:15:22.658
You... you choose
something lovely

1:15:22.693 --> 1:15:24.726
and I'll, uh,
enjoy watching you eat it.

1:15:24.761 --> 1:15:26.992
No, I... No I, well, I'm...

1:15:27.027 --> 1:15:28.895
I'm... I'm not that hungry.

1:15:28.930 --> 1:15:30.325
But you just said
you were starving.

1:15:31.636 --> 1:15:33.262
Well, I'm not gonna sit eating

1:15:33.297 --> 1:15:36.034
if you're not gonna
have anything.

1:15:36.069 --> 1:15:38.707
-Well, whyever not?
-Well--

1:15:38.742 --> 1:15:41.171
Well, maybe I'm not hungry.
You say you're not hungry.

1:15:41.206 --> 1:15:43.613
Oh, darling, don't be so silly.

1:15:49.016 --> 1:15:50.114
Well, I...

1:15:51.953 --> 1:15:53.788
Well, you order
something lovely,

1:15:53.823 --> 1:15:57.187
and, uh... and-- and enjoy it.

1:15:57.222 --> 1:16:00.927
[voice breaking] I don't have
any hunger if you aren't hungry.

1:16:00.962 --> 1:16:02.929
The second you tell me you're
hungry and you want some food,

1:16:02.964 --> 1:16:04.766
I will be hungry for it.

1:16:06.704 --> 1:16:08.737
But if you're not gonna
eat anything...

1:16:08.772 --> 1:16:11.069
Oh, darling, wha...
Don't, just don't push me.

1:16:11.104 --> 1:16:14.204
I... I'm not feeling very well.

1:16:14.239 --> 1:16:16.712
Well, we can go up if you like.
We don't have to sit here.

1:16:17.847 --> 1:16:20.012
No, don't fuss. Don't fuss.

1:16:20.047 --> 1:16:21.684
Don't fuss.

1:16:21.719 --> 1:16:23.345
It just makes me feel worse
when you do.

1:16:24.183 --> 1:16:26.282
I'm not fussing.

1:16:26.317 --> 1:16:29.219
What do you expect me to do when
you say you're not feeling well?

1:16:39.704 --> 1:16:40.967
It's like a nightmare.

1:16:43.807 --> 1:16:45.235
Oh darling.

1:16:45.270 --> 1:16:47.039
Have something delicious and...

1:16:47.074 --> 1:16:49.008
and I'll enjoy
watching you eating it.

1:16:49.043 --> 1:16:50.944
I'm not hungry.

1:16:50.979 --> 1:16:53.309
I'm not gonna eat if you don't.

1:16:57.953 --> 1:17:00.085
Mum, I don't know how
this happened. Well, how did--

1:17:01.385 --> 1:17:03.418
I just want you to be happy.
I just--

1:17:03.453 --> 1:17:06.223
I'm trying all the time
to make you happy.

1:17:07.864 --> 1:17:09.259
I can't keep guessing.

1:17:11.769 --> 1:17:14.198
Can't you just tell me,
you just...

1:17:14.233 --> 1:17:17.300
You're like a sort of
mystery person to me.

1:17:19.205 --> 1:17:21.876
And I, I've spent
all my life doing this.

1:17:21.911 --> 1:17:24.780
Trying to figure out how
to make you happy.

1:17:24.815 --> 1:17:26.408
And I have a life of my own.

1:17:26.443 --> 1:17:30.885
I have a husband
who I neglect completely,

1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:33.217
and I don't have
that much time left.

1:17:34.319 --> 1:17:36.418
And I don't have a family
beyond you.

1:17:37.322 --> 1:17:39.124
I don't have any children.

1:17:39.159 --> 1:17:40.895
And I'm not gonna have anybody

1:17:40.930 --> 1:17:43.491
to fuss over me
when I'm your age.

1:17:43.526 --> 1:17:45.867
[panting lightly]

1:17:50.071 --> 1:17:52.038
[footsteps approaching]

1:17:54.911 --> 1:17:56.108
[under breath] Ah, fu...

1:17:58.409 --> 1:17:59.914
Are you ready to order?

1:17:59.949 --> 1:18:01.146
JULIE: Um, we're not actually
gonna have anything.

1:18:01.181 --> 1:18:02.752
Um, thank you very much.

1:18:04.382 --> 1:18:05.513
Nothing at all?

1:18:05.548 --> 1:18:07.020
No, no, no. Not, not, no--

1:18:07.055 --> 1:18:08.285
I'll let you know when we do.

1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:09.891
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1:18:15.096 --> 1:18:17.162
Mum, I really didn't mean
to say that.

1:18:24.336 --> 1:18:26.776
[Julie crying]

1:18:38.284 --> 1:18:40.757
[Julie sniffling]

1:18:45.995 --> 1:18:48.391
[footsteps approaching]

1:18:51.561 --> 1:18:53.033
-Yes?
-Are you ready for the cake?

1:18:53.068 --> 1:18:54.936
Oh-- Could you come
with me, please?

1:19:01.538 --> 1:19:04.143
Could you not mention the cake
at the table?

1:19:04.178 --> 1:19:05.848
-Um, okay.
-If you could go and collect it,

1:19:05.883 --> 1:19:07.575
bring it here, with the candle.

1:19:07.610 --> 1:19:09.511
I will light the candle.

1:19:09.546 --> 1:19:11.216
-All right.
-Quick, go and get it.

1:19:11.251 --> 1:19:12.514
Yeah, I will.

1:19:13.517 --> 1:19:15.253
[Julie sniffles]

1:19:26.431 --> 1:19:29.267
-I said I wanted to light it.
-Okay.

1:19:29.302 --> 1:19:31.104
And I want
to carry it in like this.

1:19:31.139 --> 1:19:34.239
Thank you. Thank you.

1:19:39.213 --> 1:19:44.854
[singing]<i> Happy birthday to you</i>

1:19:45.956 --> 1:19:51.993
[sniffles]
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:19:52.930 --> 1:19:58.967
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mum</i>

1:20:00.432 --> 1:20:07.976
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:20:22.421 --> 1:20:23.585
Do you want me to do it?

1:20:29.032 --> 1:20:31.230
[sobbing]

1:20:38.668 --> 1:20:41.405
[muffled techno music playing]

1:20:55.091 --> 1:20:57.157
[bell tolling]

1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:29.992
[Julie crying softly]

1:21:35.362 --> 1:21:37.263
[Louis whimpering]

1:21:41.698 --> 1:21:44.072
[Julie continues crying]

1:21:49.607 --> 1:21:51.508
[Louis whines]

1:22:00.057 --> 1:22:02.222
[crying continues, faint]

1:22:04.754 --> 1:22:06.655
[crying stops]

1:22:23.311 --> 1:22:25.179
[faint crying resumes]

1:22:31.319 --> 1:22:33.418
[knocking lightly]

1:22:37.358 --> 1:22:39.622
[lamp buzzing fitfully]

1:22:53.308 --> 1:22:54.472
BILL: Are you all right?

1:22:54.507 --> 1:22:56.210
[sighs]

1:23:00.711 --> 1:23:02.249
[light sob]

1:23:04.649 --> 1:23:07.452
[crying] I just...
I didn't get it right.

1:23:10.292 --> 1:23:14.459
You did everything right.
You did.

1:23:17.761 --> 1:23:19.662
[crying lightly]

1:23:35.350 --> 1:23:38.054
Now, get some rest.

1:23:38.683 --> 1:23:40.452
And I'll see you in the morning.

1:23:41.521 --> 1:23:43.059
-Good night.
-Good night.

1:23:56.503 --> 1:23:58.371
[Louis whimpers softly]

1:26:18.810 --> 1:26:19.941
Mum...

1:26:23.683 --> 1:26:25.914
[Louis whimpers]

1:26:43.538 --> 1:26:45.901

1:29:52.529 --> 1:29:53.858
-Good morning.
-Morning.

1:29:54.861 --> 1:29:55.893
RECEPTIONIST: Are you
gonna be okay with your bags?

1:29:55.928 --> 1:29:57.433
Yes, thank you.

1:29:58.634 --> 1:30:00.436
-There.
-Thank you.

1:30:08.644 --> 1:30:11.238
Um, I just wanted to say

1:30:11.273 --> 1:30:12.910
I hope you're okay.

1:30:15.948 --> 1:30:17.618
Thank you.
And I was going to say

1:30:17.653 --> 1:30:19.147
thank you for looking after me.

1:30:19.182 --> 1:30:22.491
