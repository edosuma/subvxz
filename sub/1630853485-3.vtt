00:10.000 --> 00:11.440
There's been a blackout
for 12 hours.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.680
We thought you were all dead.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.760
Your wife's in there.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.720
Something occurred that night.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.240
It seems that
you've all fallen pregnant.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.760
Is that a camera?
Yeah.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.920
They're filming us!

00:22.960 --> 00:25.560
You don't think
that I'm mother material.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.320
The baby has my DNA but not yours.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.280
For two years after the births,
we lived a secret life.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.240
We told no-one
what we were going through.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.200
Morning!

00:53.240 --> 00:54.800
Good morning.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Our worlds became smaller.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.520
Our worlds became Midwich.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.240
We got used to our lives.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.960
Got used to the rules.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.320
We could see
that our children were special.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.640
Not normal for their age.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.840
But we loved them.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.400
And they loved us too.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.840
We told ourselves we were happy,

01:37.880 --> 01:39.880
that everything was all right.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.720
And then one morning,
everything changed.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.880
Sunny, what are you doing?

02:39.000 --> 02:44.440
23... 24... 26...

02:44.480 --> 02:48.720
27... 28... 29...

02:48.760 --> 02:51.200
30. I'm coming, ready or not.

02:54.720 --> 02:59.560
Now, where could
these little rascals be?

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
Hm...

03:06.200 --> 03:08.200
Could they be in here?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.840
No. They're not in here.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.440
How about...

03:20.160 --> 03:21.480
Mm.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.520
I wonder if...

03:25.200 --> 03:27.800
Maybe they've gone back downstairs.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.840
Found you!
Attack! Get him!

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
Come here, you!

03:50.320 --> 03:52.320
Come on in.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.480
Welcome. Welcome to your new school.
If you'd like to follow me...

04:02.080 --> 04:05.680
So the aim of today is for you

04:05.720 --> 04:07.880
Ready for your start at the school
next week.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.320
This is where you children
will learn your sciences.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.160
You will conduct experiments
in the schoolroom... Wow. I know.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.040
..as well as using
our beautiful grounds

04:18.080 --> 04:20.080
to study plant and insect life.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.280
We are currently upgrading
our IT with the help of Ward 300.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.600
What do you think, Evie?

04:26.640 --> 04:28.640
I like it.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.680
I thought you would.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.400
This room has been
specially designed and tailored

04:34.440 --> 04:36.080
to suit the needs of the children.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.560
It's where they'll have
their rest time.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.920
We all know by now
they like to take a small sleep

04:39.960 --> 04:41.720
in the middle of the day.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.760
We firmly believe this increases
focus and productivity.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.840
Is this also
where they can have time reading?

04:46.880 --> 04:48.480
I know they're already
really enjoying that.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.520
Yes, that happens after lunch.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
Your brother is going to be
so jealous.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.880
Please follow me into the reception.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.920
Nath! Pay attention.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
Sorry, Uncle Paul.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.160
No, actually, Nathan has stumbled on
something very interesting here.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.800
This place was used for children

05:19.840 --> 05:22.320
who were evacuated from Birmingham
during the war.

05:22.360 --> 05:25.440
So it's not the first time it's
been used for a special purpose.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.120
You can still see the air raid
shelters under the school.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.480
OK, now let's gather
in the main hall

05:30.520 --> 05:32.520
and we can give the children
their uniforms.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.520
Hello.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.080
Is your daddy there?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.520
Charlotte, who is that?

06:20.760 --> 06:23.360
Um... What are you doing here?

06:23.400 --> 06:25.400
She made me come.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.240
Don't forget to pick up
your uniforms and sports kits.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.040
Hang on. There.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.840
Morning.
Morning.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.880
Hi.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.360
Hi.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.880
Hi, Zoe.
Did Mr Clyde give you the tour?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.120
Oh, yeah, he loved it.
Centre of attention as usual.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.680
I um... I just wanted to say
thank you, actually.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.920
I didn't do anything.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.960
You did.
I really struggled at first,

07:14.000 --> 07:15.720
with the whole thing,
the experiment and...

07:15.760 --> 07:18.680
Everyone found it difficult.
Not everyone.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.320
Look at me, Mummy.
You look amazing, baby.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.240
Really suits you. You look amazing.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.480
I think this was
a needed gift for Cassie.

07:28.880 --> 07:33.080
She's a natural.
I had to...work a bit harder.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.160
Now?

07:36.200 --> 07:38.920
Oh, now,
Hannah's all I want in the world.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.600
What was that?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.640
Maybe it was just the bulbs.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.400
That's not just the bulbs.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.280
Is that us?

08:24.920 --> 08:25.920
Who's she?

08:27.320 --> 08:28.640
I don't know.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.280
Charlotte!

08:35.960 --> 08:38.320
What are you doing here?
There's a lady with Daddy.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.400
She came in a car.
That's her little girl.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.080
Did Daddy say anything else?

08:44.120 --> 08:46.120
He said they needed to talk alone.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.040
Come with me. Come on.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.840
Yeah, this is Haynes. There's
something going on down here.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.520
Tilly!

09:29.080 --> 09:30.280
Tilly.

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
Tilly.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.960
Come on, come on.
Tilly, that's enough!

09:41.960 --> 09:43.960
Hannah, you don't know this girl.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.600
Let's go. Come on.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.680
Who's that?
She's new to me.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.040
I'll be right back.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.360
Hi, I'm Susannah Zellaby.
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.800
You have my daughter?
Yes, she's just in the car.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.080
Can we talk?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.120
This is just a little
misunderstanding.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.280
I'm sure it is.
If we can just be left on our own.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.520
You're not from Midwich, are you?
No.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.080
I hope you don't mind me asking.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.760
But where you here,
the night of the blackout?

10:46.960 --> 10:48.720
Susannah's with the mother.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.600
I'm getting her paperwork sorted.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.640
We'll need accommodation.
Don't let her leave.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.680
What do we know about her?

10:55.760 --> 10:59.640
She worked as a consultant on
Stewart McClain's council campaign.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.320
How the fuck did we miss her?

11:05.240 --> 11:06.480
Hey, sweetheart.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.480
Hannah, look at me.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.640
Hey. It's OK.
Just tell us what happened.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.680
No-one's going to get angry.

11:15.120 --> 11:17.120
How did you know that girl?

11:18.280 --> 11:20.280
We've always known her.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.640
I didn't want to have the baby
in the first place.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.160
I went to the clinic but...
I couldn't do it.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.400
So then Stewart and I
had this agreement.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.760
He'd give me money
and I'd bring her up on my own.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.800
And was that easy?

11:39.680 --> 11:41.680
It was fine.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.680
It was tiring, of course,
but Sunny's wonderful.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.400
She's never been any trouble.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.800
I'm so glad I kept her. I can't

11:55.080 --> 11:57.080
You must have noticed she's...

11:57.840 --> 12:01.160
Well, she's been growing much
more quickly than normal children.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.560
I went to two different doctors

12:02.600 --> 12:05.000
and they both said
there was nothing to worry about.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.080
Why did I know nothing about this?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.200
Sorry.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.480
Who's this?

12:30.520 --> 12:31.880
Um... DCI Paul Haynes.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.920
Don't worry,
you've done nothing wrong.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.920
But we would like you to stay in

12:38.960 --> 12:42.120
Why? Well, certain procedures
we have to go through,

12:42.160 --> 12:44.160
test we need to run on Sunny.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.960
We'll put you up in a hotel.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
No, thanks.
I think we're better off at home.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.560
I'm sorry, Amrita.
It... it's not as simple as that.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.200
This whole thing
is a carefully guarded secret.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.200
Not my problem.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.760
Come on, Sunny!

13:00.760 --> 13:03.160
You've met your dad
but now it's time to go.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.640
I want to stay here.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.320
Don't be stupid, Sunny.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.960
I want to see the others.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.600
Which others do you mean?

13:11.640 --> 13:12.800
The others.

13:12.840 --> 13:18.600
Hannah, Joe, Connor,
Lily-Grace, Mason, Ezra,

13:18.640 --> 13:21.320
Milo, Louis, Olive, Adnan...

13:21.360 --> 13:24.560
Stop that, Sunny.
Juliet, Livy, Chuka,

13:24.600 --> 13:30.160
Andrew, Lucy, Flora,
Kingston, Jamie, Winston...

13:49.320 --> 13:51.320
We're ready to proceed.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.240
Now, on the screens in front of you
are some images.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.520
Evie, would you like to start us off,
please?

14:01.280 --> 14:03.280
And choose a picture.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.760
Excellent.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.600
Now, the rest of you,
click on the picture Evie chose.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.480
That's impossible.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.240
Excellent. Let's play again.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.680
Sunny, now it's your turn
to select a different picture.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.320
What the hell?

14:45.240 --> 14:46.720
Why are we here?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.760
No-one's telling us anything.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.840
Beats me.
I texted Paul but no answer.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.080
Who's the mother, anyway?
She's from London.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.920
Sarah's beside herself.
I reckon she'll kick him out.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.920
How long's it going to be?

15:00.960 --> 15:01.960
It's fine.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.320
Bathroom?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.720
Hi.
Who are you?

16:28.400 --> 16:30.400
I'm one of the blackout mums.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.440
Are you the mother of the child
from the cricket pitch?

16:33.480 --> 16:35.640
Blackout mum?
Is that what you call yourself?

16:36.720 --> 16:38.800
It's kind of a shorthand.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.560
Well, I don't like it. It's weird.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.480
It's a weird situation.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.960
I just want to leave.
They won't let me.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.280
I'm Zoe.
Amrita. Hi.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.720
What is this place?

17:03.760 --> 17:06.600
It's called Ward 300.

17:06.640 --> 17:10.840
It's for the children. They test
them, monitor their development.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.080
Jesus!

17:13.120 --> 17:14.120
Yeah.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.720
I always knew she was different.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.160
What did you feel was special
about her?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.080
I don't know.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.680
She had this...hold over me.

17:27.080 --> 17:31.280
Like a spell, you know?

17:33.520 --> 17:34.520
Yeah.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.440
This woman I spoke to said
they want us to stay in Midwich,

17:39.480 --> 17:42.520
like permanently.
She offered to pay me.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.360
They're paying all of us.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.360
And they're monitoring us
all the time.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.160
No-one goes anywhere.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.240
What do you mean?

17:50.280 --> 17:53.280
Well, I haven't left Midwich
since Hannah was born.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.560
None of us leave.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.240
I gave up work,
I don't see old friends.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.280
Family visits are kept to a minimum.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.840
And we pretend it's a choice
but it isn't.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.240
We're slowly cutting ourselves off
from the world.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.080
I've... I've told no-one this.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.440
A man came to the house once.
Just once.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.360
He said he was a doctor
but I don't think he was.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.120
He and Sunny spoke for an hour
and he left.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.280
If they knew about me all the time,
why didn't they say something?

18:36.440 --> 18:37.880
I shouldn't be here.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.640
Give me your number, please.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.640
Amrita, if you want to leave,
you should go, while you can.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.440
I don't understand. How can that be?

19:06.880 --> 19:09.640
I know it's disturbing
but the evidence is clear.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.920
If one child learns something,
they all know it.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.920
It's a hive mind.

19:16.960 --> 19:21.080
The knowledge transmits without
the need for language or expression.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
Why didn't we know this before?

19:24.680 --> 19:27.880
Either it hasn't happened before
or they hid it.

19:36.760 --> 19:40.760
OK. Thank you so much, everyone.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.680
So, how did he do?

19:57.160 --> 19:58.360
Bloody brilliant, weren't you?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.240
I got them all right,
didn't I, Uncle Paul?

20:00.880 --> 20:04.480
Aced it, mate. Now you go home with
Mummy and I'll see you later, OK?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.520
OK.
All right. Bye.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.160
I need to go back. I have to
look after the new mother.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
Mum, what's going on?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.920
Look, we're not sure yet.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.120
Some kind of subliminal communication
between the children.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.600
Keep that to yourself for now.

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
Mummy.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
Come on.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
Come on. Hannah?

21:05.160 --> 21:06.240
What is it?

21:31.160 --> 21:34.160
Evie, why are you wearing
that jacket?

21:34.200 --> 21:36.320
You don't start school
for another week.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.360
I want to wear it.

21:40.840 --> 21:41.960
That's pretty.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.400
Did Granny tell you, Mummy?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
About us?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.880
Yeah. She did, a bit.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.720
I just...hear my friends' thoughts.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.040
That's all.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.040
Does it scare you?

22:04.520 --> 22:06.240
No.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.360
No, of course not.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.480
I love you more than ever, OK?

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
OK?

22:34.400 --> 22:36.400
"It's a hive mind...hid it."

22:44.920 --> 22:46.680
I got them all right,
didn't I, Uncle Paul?

22:46.720 --> 22:49.120
I'm going to see Westcott.
Arrange a meeting for Monday.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.160
All the parents.
Say nothing till then.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.840
You're fond of him, aren't you?

22:55.040 --> 22:57.040
Yeah. I guess.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.440
And the mother?
What's that supposed to mean?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.280
It's OK, I'm not judging you.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.640
Fuck off to London, would you?

23:09.560 --> 23:12.440
What is it? I thought
you should have a look at this.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.120
It was earlier today.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.800
Could have just been an accident.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.560
You weren't there.
You didn't see her face.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.840
I overheard them
talking in Ward 300.

23:30.440 --> 23:35.120
They talked about one mind,
like they're all one being.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.040
Just calm down, OK?
She's an amazing kid.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Don't go back there.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.040
Hey.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.720
Mummy doesn't love me any more.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.200
What? Of course she does.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
No. Only you do.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.640
I'm sorry about keeping you
in the hotel.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.680
It's only for a few more days.
Sure.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.720
In you go.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.920
Um... I can get there myself.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
I've been told to make sure
you're OK.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.720
Hi.
Hi.

24:42.760 --> 24:43.760
All right?

24:50.760 --> 24:52.920
Uncle Paul,
can you play hide and seek?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.880
Not now, Nathan.
Just one game, please.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.600
Nathan, you can play with Lily-Grace
when Mary-Ann comes round tomorrow.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.440
OK?
It doesn't work with Lily-Grace.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.600
It's hide and seek. Of course
it works. No, it doesn't.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.800
She'll know where I'm hiding.
What do you mean?

25:07.960 --> 25:09.000
You should tell her.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.080
Tell me what?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.480
Hannah, love! Tea's ready!

25:29.160 --> 25:31.160
You all right?
Afternoon.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.720
Did you hear about the new girl?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.000
Yeah.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.160
How did they not know about her?
Bunch of bloody amateurs.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.840
I heard there may have been
a development with the children.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.760
It's got nothing to do with me
or you, though, has it?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.840
Joe's in your house.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.360
Let me explain something to you.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
See that boy? That's my son.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.720
I'd kill for him, die for him.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.200
I'm getting closer, Joe!

25:59.240 --> 26:02.960
But that one, that's just 30 grand
a year tax-free from the government.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
He's only here
till the money runs out.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.000
Joe, look at me!

26:12.800 --> 26:14.800
Hannah!

26:17.200 --> 26:18.240
Didn't you hear me?

26:18.280 --> 26:20.280
I was playing with my farm.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.040
Come and sit down, then.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.840
We didn't hurt the dog.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.440
Argh!

26:50.960 --> 26:52.960
Argh!

26:54.080 --> 26:56.760
We didn't hurt the dog.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.360
You OK?

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
Jesus! Quick, quick, hold it here.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.680
Daddy, what happened?
Oh, it's OK.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.120
Mummy just hurt herself, that's all.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.840
Listen,
I understand this is difficult.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.280
You should have been part of this
a long time ago.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.880
I'm scared.
I don't know what's going on.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.920
No, none of us do.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.120
Which is why we need you
to give us a little bit more time.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.160
Trust me, please.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.560
I'd like some answers.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.760
Amrita, take Sunny to the room.
Sarah, can I have a word?

28:28.800 --> 28:31.120
No. I want to talk to her.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.800
It's fine. She has a right to know.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.720
Take Sunny for me, would you?
This won't take long.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.760
Yeah. We'll wait in the bar.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.680
Come on.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Would you like a drink, Sunny?
Something fizzy?

28:51.440 --> 28:54.520
Uh, a lemonade, please.
Certainly.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.040
You all right, Sunny?
Who are you looking at?

29:03.880 --> 29:04.920
Mummy.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.480
She's just talking to the lady.
She won't be long.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.880
Thanks.

29:10.480 --> 29:14.320
All right, let's sit up here
and drink your drink.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.160
So how long have you known
the other children, Sunny?

29:22.080 --> 29:24.080
Since always.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.680
So why didn't you come back
to be with them before?

29:28.720 --> 29:31.800
I didn't need to. But now I do.

29:34.520 --> 29:38.960
Look, it was three years ago
and it was a stupid fling, OK?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.760
Did Stewart know you got pregnant?
Yes.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.760
But he never gave a shit
about Sunny or me.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
So why are you here?
It wasn't my choice!

29:45.840 --> 29:47.440
Ha! Bullshit.
Listen to me!

29:47.480 --> 29:50.320
Why would I come here?
I don't need him or you.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.800
My life is fine.
I didn't ask for any of this.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.600
Where's Sunny?
I want to go to the room.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.640
Sh-She's by the bar.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.280
Where is she?

30:01.480 --> 30:02.480
Sunny!

30:28.720 --> 30:29.720
Mummy.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.640
Sunny! What are you doing?

30:40.080 --> 30:41.280
Leave her alone!

30:59.440 --> 31:01.840
When were you going to tell me?
About the kids?

31:03.960 --> 31:05.640
We're going to tell everyone
on Monday.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.680
And I'm just "everyone", am I?

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
No, of course not.
Just a citizen?

31:11.320 --> 31:13.280
Jodie, I've got a lot going on
at the moment.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
I could do without this.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.680
So sorry

31:24.720 --> 31:27.800
I don't actually have to live here.
Do you know that?

31:29.040 --> 31:31.480
I could have moved out ages ago.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.200
The government would have paid
for my rent.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.640
But I knew how much

31:35.680 --> 31:36.680
What are you saying?

31:36.720 --> 31:39.040
I'm saying if you don't trust me,
then we have a problem.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.160
Of course I trust you.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.800
But there's always going to
be things that I can't tell you.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.720
You'd have told Deborah.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.760
What did you say?
You heard.

31:49.520 --> 31:52.240
Don't go there, Jodie. Just don't.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.040
I'll call Mary-Ann in the morning

31:58.080 --> 32:00.240
and see if she's got
any decent apartments available.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.280
Yeah, you do what you want.
I will.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.760
Well, go on, then.
I didn't ask for any of this!

32:04.800 --> 32:06.800
Do you understand that? None of it.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.080
Were you fighting?

32:12.120 --> 32:13.920
No.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.600
Come. Come and sit with me.
I'm sorry.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.960
What are you looking at?
Pictures of you, Mummy.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.200
And that's you, Daddy.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.440
That's amazing!

32:35.200 --> 32:37.600
You close your eyes. Olive,
you're going to choose something.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.640
And Evie,
you're going to guess what it is.

32:39.680 --> 32:43.080
Come here. No peeking.
Right, no peeking.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.640
I have it.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.160
OK, Evie, what has Olive picked?

32:49.680 --> 32:51.240
A hanky.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.280
Hurray!

33:03.720 --> 33:05.400
I thought we agreed

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
I didn't. Evie told me.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.320
It doesn't have to be
like a dirty secret, Mum.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.360
We always knew they were special.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
At least I did, anyway.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.560
Did you do it?
Yes. Did you get it right?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.200
Sweet dreams.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.240
How does that sound?

33:58.280 --> 34:00.280
Can I get an ice cream?
Ice cream?

34:00.360 --> 34:01.840
Yes.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.880
OK. Night-night, my angel girl.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
Love you.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.840
The kids are asleep upstairs.
Go straight to my office.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.960
Sit down.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.360
I know this sounds crazy.
No, go on.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.760
This afternoon, Hannah...

34:35.240 --> 34:38.680
made me hold my hand
over a pan of boiling water.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.720
She made me hold it there.

34:42.120 --> 34:45.080
What do you mean?
Literally that. I couldn't move.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.880
She wanted to hurt me.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.200
Zoe, why would she want to hurt you?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.800
Because I think
she sees me as a threat.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.840
She doesn't trust me.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Hey, sweetie.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.840
We're going home.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.760
They said we could. Come on.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.800
Listen, we don't belong here.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.440
We're going home, OK? Let's go.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.440
It's like she's been lying
to me and Sam all this time.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.440
Growing more and more attached to us

35:38.480 --> 35:40.640
and then this new child's arrived
and everything's changed.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.840
And it's not just her,
it's all of them.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.360
Amrita sensed it too.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.440
Amrita?

35:46.480 --> 35:48.360
Yes, I spoke to her.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.760
And then I overheard you talking,
saying that they're all one mind.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.400
Well, we don't know what they are -
But you did say that.

35:57.160 --> 36:00.040
I don't trust them. None of them.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.680
Listen, the last few days
have been strange, to say the least.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.360
But there have been no incidents
for two years.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.160
You don't believe me.
That's not what I said.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.200
Sam doesn't believe me, either.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.720
I should go.
Please, Zoe, sit down.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.440
I... No, I don't...
I shouldn't have come.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.480
Zoe, sit down.
I thought you might understand.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.520
I DO understand.
No, you don't!

36:39.280 --> 36:42.960
You... You're not seeing it.
Any of it.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.160
Zoe, please. Zoe...

36:46.640 --> 36:47.880
Zoe, please. Can -

36:57.200 --> 36:59.160
"This is Zoe Moran.
Please leave a message."

36:59.200 --> 37:03.120
Zoe, I'm taking your advice.
We're leaving.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.440
Good luck. I'm thinking of you.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.640
If you ever get out of here,
call me.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.520
Nathan?

38:09.680 --> 38:11.040
Nathan.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Come on.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.800
Sunny, come here.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.000
Sunny, come on. We're going home.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.000
Sunny. Please.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.240
It's going to be OK.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.080
You don't belong here.
You're mine, OK?

39:10.840 --> 39:12.840
Come on! That's enough!

39:14.960 --> 39:16.040
Get in. Now.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.320
I'll wait another five minutes.
Yeah.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.560
Hi.
Evening, Zoe.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.760
Where have you been?

39:46.800 --> 39:48.360
I just went for a walk.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.560
Well, you can ask her yourself now.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.280
Ask me what?

39:53.320 --> 39:56.080
You were in
the restricted area earlier.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.120
Ward 300.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.600
Just wanted to know why.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.600
Oh, I... got lost.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.640
You spoke to the new girl's mother.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.680
Yeah, I just wanted to be friendly.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.040
Did she say anything to you?

40:11.080 --> 40:13.640
Anything you think we ought to know?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.800
No. Nothing.

40:20.960 --> 40:25.600
Amrita's got a lot to cope with.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.560
Please don't do it again.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.200
I'll see myself out.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.480
You didn't tell me you did that.
What?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.520
You didn't tell me
anything about it.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.160
Cos you didn't want to know.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.720
Charlotte.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.920
Charlotte.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.400
Thanks for coming.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.640
Just that her mother

41:55.200 --> 41:57.200
It's her second helping.
She hadn't even fed her.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.680
I...tried to call her.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.280
There was no reply.

42:01.320 --> 42:06.000
Right. Well, I should probably take
Sunny to Ward 300 until we find her.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.440
I want to stay here.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.560
Sunny, this isn't your home, is it?

42:13.600 --> 42:16.560
I want to live here.
This is where I began.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.800
Excuse me.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.520
Yeah?

42:26.560 --> 42:28.560
There's something
you need to see right now.

43:21.480 --> 43:24.680
"Zoe, I'm taking your advice.
We're leaving.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.480
Good luck.

43:27.520 --> 43:31.000
I'm thinking of you. If you
ever get out of here, call me."

43:56.440 --> 43:58.040
Shh.
