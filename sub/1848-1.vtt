01:29.720 --> 01:31.404
I hope so.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.281
- All right, you guys gotta call me.
- Yeah.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.051
Make this happen.
Make this happen, all right?

01:39.280 --> 01:41.965
See you guys. See you. All right.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.324
- Joey, what's up? The usual?
- Yeah.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.210
- Thanks, Willy.
- I hope you had a nice night.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.090
Yes, sir.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.045
What about that new place?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.925
Oh, girl, I gotta go. Bye.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.169
- You're late.
- Time is a relative thing, doll.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.885
Mr. Hardigan, he's furious.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.203
Mr. Blumenthal's threatening
to take his business elsewhere.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.523
Guy named Pat Vinelli said
stay away from his sister or else.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.610
- Patricia.
- Oh, and this one, your ex-wife...

02:31.800 --> 02:34.167
...Donna Hawthorne?
She's really pissed.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.647
- She's always pissed.
- I don't blame her.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.930
Damn.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.404
Mr. Sharkey, he's in his office.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.322
- There he is.
- Hey, boss man.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.130
- Joe, how you doing?
- Good.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.729
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, let me take a look at those.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.321
- Watch the fight?
- I didn't. I was working.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.006
Talk to me about Newcombe.
Are you gonna bag him?

02:59.160 --> 03:03.131
- This is a make it or break it for us.
- Got dinner tonight at the Pinnacle.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.770
- Pinnacle? Expensive.
- Yup.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.367
Necessary.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.522
- All right, reel him in.
- I always do.

03:08.720 --> 03:12.088
If you don't, we're fucked.
Now, let me make this very clear.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.645
- If you don't...
I'm_

03:13.800 --> 03:16.041
...you're fucked.
- Got it. I got the deal.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.410
Clean yourself up a little bit. Put on
your best suit. Wear cologne, smell good.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.245
- Aramis. That chickie of his likes you.
- Loveit

03:23.440 --> 03:27.126
- You knock them out, champ.
- I will. Bob and weave. Bob and weave.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.690
Boxing.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.610
Primitive.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.401
<i>- Yeah, Joe Doucett.
- That was a long lunch.</i>

03:39.880 --> 03:42.565
- What can I do for you?
- You know what day this is?

03:42.760 --> 03:45.411
Yes, I do. It's the 8th of October...

03:45.600 --> 03:50.527
...the year of our Lord 1993, which means
that I'm late with my child support again.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.007
That is not why I'm calling, you know it.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.410
<i>I asked you to come to Mia's party three
weeks ago, you never called me back.</i>

03:57.560 --> 03:59.688
- Well, I can't make it, Donna.
- Why not?

03:59.920 --> 04:04.130
<i>- Because I have a big client dinner.
- Well, that's way more important...</i>

04:04.280 --> 04:08.285
<i>...than your daughter's birthday.
- Listen, she is 3 years old, okay?</i>

04:08.480 --> 04:13.122
Three years old, okay? Do you think
she cares whether I'm there or not?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.685
You know what, Joe?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.007
As a husband, as a father...

04:17.200 --> 04:21.808
...you are a fucking joke!
- You know what? You're a bitch, Donna.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.367
- What did you say?
- You're a fucking bitch!

04:24.560 --> 04:26.847
- Fuck...
- Fuck!

04:27.960 --> 04:30.884
<i>We don't make ads for Joe Doakes.</i>

04:31.120 --> 04:34.203
<i>No, John Q. Public, John and Jane Doe,
Mr. Everyman.</i>

04:34.360 --> 04:36.044
<i>No, no, no.</i>

04:36.240 --> 04:38.447
<i>We make ads for Daniel Newcombe.</i>

04:38.640 --> 04:41.086
<i>We make ads for Joe Doucett.</i>

04:41.240 --> 04:45.006
<i>We cater to the elite,
the creme de la creme.</i>

04:45.200 --> 04:48.682
Celebrities, athletes,
entertainers, rappers.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.925
All in a Daniel Newcombe fine motor
vehicle. That's what I'm gonna do for you.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.727
- Ýt's a really great idea.
- It's a great idea. Listen to the lady.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.844
- I'm gonna give you a shot.
- That's what I like to hear.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.567
- Call me at the office first thing Monday.
- I will do so, sir.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.568
I've gotta make a call.
Please excuse me.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.291
You gotta do business
when you gotta do business.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.046
<i>- Don't be long? Okay.
- I'll be right back, baby.</i>

05:12.240 --> 05:14.083
- A beautiful couple.
- He's the best.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.362
You won't regret it. I promise you.

05:23.760 --> 05:24.841
Congratulations.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.362
Thank you, Judy. I don't think
I could've done that without you.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.766
Oh, sure you could've.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.362
Laughing at all my jokes,
telling him what great ideas I have.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.887
- They are great ideas.
- I appreciate that.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.051
From one bullshit artist to another.
Listen.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.080
I was thinking,
what do you say you and I...

05:45.320 --> 05:48.563
...we get together this weekend,
ditch the old man...

05:48.760 --> 05:51.445
...bottle of Scotch, eight ball of coke...

05:52.240 --> 05:53.969
...dirty movies on Skinemax?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.441
- Excuse me?
- What?

05:57.720 --> 05:59.802
Let me get this straight.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.608
You think I said those things
because I wanna fuck you?

06:03.840 --> 06:05.444
- Yeah.
- No.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.291
- No?
- No. I wanna get out of here...

06:08.480 --> 06:12.007
...and away from you
as fast as humanly possible.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.409
- Daniel likes you, God knows why.
- Okay.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.802
- But, Joe?
- Yeah?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.047
You're a dick.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.527
And I would rather fuck a corpse.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.085
Joe.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.448
- You wanna disrespect me?
- No. I didn't...

06:25.640 --> 06:28.325
- That's all right.
- It was just a misunderstanding.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.921
I'm a big boy. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.241
Okay.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.683
But you disrespect the woman I love,
son, that's...

06:35.840 --> 06:39.003
- That's just plain stupid.
- It was just a misunderstanding.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.603
Let's go, baby.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.651
He's not worth the trouble.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.204
I'm dry!

06:59.400 --> 07:01.368
Does anybody have any more alcohol?

07:01.600 --> 07:02.840
Shut the fuck up!

07:03.040 --> 07:07.762
Does anyone have more alcohol?

07:11.040 --> 07:12.371
I can't...

07:12.560 --> 07:14.927
<i>I don't wanna go anymore</i>

07:17.960 --> 07:20.201
Hey, wait up!

07:34.400 --> 07:36.323
U.S.A.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.209
U.S.A.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.889
U.S.A.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.849
What is that?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.320
What is that?

07:53.520 --> 07:54.646
I know what that is.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.524
- What have you got?
- Five dollar.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.361
What?
I haven't even touched anything yet.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.165
Okay?

08:03.680 --> 08:06.650
- How much is that?
- Five dollar.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.960
My daughter.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.571
She's gonna be 3 years old.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.605
It's her birthday.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.763
- Give me 5 dollar.
- Three years old.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.811
Three years old.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.291
- Spec...
- Give me 5 dollar.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.568
You give me 5 dollar.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.690
No.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.570
Stop it.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.489
<i>Hey-</i>

08:45.760 --> 08:47.603
Hey!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.809
<i>Chucky!</i>

08:51.000 --> 08:52.923
- Chucky!
- We're closed.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.451
No! It's Joe!

08:54.640 --> 08:57.803
- Are you deaf? I said we're closed.
- Joe! Open up.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.205
Hey! Come on! Give me one drink.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.806
- Come on. One...
- Coffee.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.604
No. Fuck coffee.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.609
- No, you promised.
- You promised.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.087
- You promised.
- You promised. Tell the duck.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.530
I don't wanna tell the duck. Come back
tomorrow. You'll thank me in the morning.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.886
No! No!

09:17.080 --> 09:19.287
Fuck, no!

09:19.680 --> 09:21.250
Goddamn it.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.363
You don't wanna have fun!

09:23.560 --> 09:26.325
Nobody wants to have fun anymore.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.522
Goddamn it.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.449
<i>Hey-</i>

09:32.120 --> 09:34.088
What are you doing?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.485
Hi.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.250
Hey, I'm gonna take a piss, all right?

10:46.200 --> 10:47.611
Okay?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.609
Sorry about the toilet.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.564
I didn't mean...

11:21.080 --> 11:22.650
Hello?

11:24.240 --> 11:25.765
Hello?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.444
Underwear.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.847
What the hell is this?

12:04.880 --> 12:07.167
Where the fuck is the phone?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.450
Hello?

12:24.720 --> 12:26.131
Can anybody hear me?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.323
Hello?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.443
Son of a bitch.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.607
Hello?

12:48.840 --> 12:50.842
Can anybody hear me on the outside?

12:51.080 --> 12:53.481
I'm stuck in a motel room.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.806
Hello?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.371
Fuck!

12:57.480 --> 12:59.926
Hello?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.441
Hey. He)'-

13:12.960 --> 13:15.361
Tell me why I'm here. Tell... No, listen.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.807
Tell me why I'm here. No, no, no.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.405
Dumplings. Anything but dumplings.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.609
Please.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.167
Please can I have something else
to eat?

14:36.360 --> 14:39.045
Jesus H. Christ, God love you...

14:39.200 --> 14:42.249
...give me something
other than this crap.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.362
<i>We're gonna squeeze for two...</i>

14:46.560 --> 14:49.848
<i>...and then we're gonna open for two.
Make sure you resist it.</i>

14:50.040 --> 14:53.726
<i>This is a great way to tone
and strengthen your upper legs.</i>

14:53.920 --> 14:57.322
<i>And we all know that's an area
that often gets neglected.</i>

14:57.520 --> 15:00.842
<i>So, if you haven't already,
join with me now.</i>

15:01.080 --> 15:02.650
<i>And squeeze.</i>

15:02.880 --> 15:05.406
<i>Come on, and up. Good.</i>

15:05.600 --> 15:07.523
<i>- Can you feel the burn?
- Yes.</i>

15:07.760 --> 15:09.046
<i>- And release.
- Release.</i>

15:09.240 --> 15:10.366
Here we go.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.800
- And...
- Squeeze.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.047
<i>And release.</i>

15:13.240 --> 15:15.766
<i>- Let's go, keep going. Squeeze.
Squeeze.</i>

15:15.960 --> 15:17.041
<i>And up.</i>

15:23.520 --> 15:25.090
<i>Now we're gonna speed it up.</i>

15:25.320 --> 15:27.049
Oh, yeah.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.365
<i>- Good. Feel it.
- I am.</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:40.323
<i>Good, and open.</i>

15:40.520 --> 15:43.649
<i>Good, and squeeze. And...</i>

15:43.880 --> 15:46.326
<i>Good. Squeeze.</i>

15:47.320 --> 15:48.651
<i>And open.</i>

15:48.880 --> 15:50.291
<i>Squeeze.</i>

15:50.480 --> 15:51.970
<i>And open.</i>

16:24.280 --> 16:25.611
<i>There she is.</i>

16:28.240 --> 16:29.651
<i>I owe you one.</i>

16:31.600 --> 16:35.241
<i>Early this morning, the body
of single mother Donna Hawthorne...</i>

16:35.440 --> 16:37.886
<i>...was discovered
in her Southside apartment.</i>

16:38.080 --> 16:42.688
<i>Police confirmed that she was raped
and savagely beaten to death.</i>

16:43.280 --> 16:46.966
<i>The victim was the mother
of a 3-year-old girl...</i>

16:47.160 --> 16:50.403
<i>...who was inside the apartment
at the time of the killing.</i>

16:51.000 --> 16:53.401
<i>To quote forensic investigators:</i>

16:53.600 --> 16:56.843
<i>The evidence is irrefutable.</i>

16:57.040 --> 17:01.648
<i>Prime suspect Joseph Doucett
was the victim's former husband...</i>

17:01.840 --> 17:05.049
<i>...and father of the surviving child.</i>

17:05.240 --> 17:09.404
<i>That's all from Stephanie Lee,
here on the scene. Back to you, Michael.</i>

17:28.200 --> 17:29.281
<i>Remember...</i>

17:29.480 --> 17:33.326
<i>...your enemy is most vulnerable
just before he strikes.</i>

17:41.160 --> 17:45.051
<i>This area is extremely dangerous.
Don't let your guard down for a second.</i>

17:45.520 --> 17:47.488
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

17:47.680 --> 17:49.569
<i>This is really big.</i>

17:49.760 --> 17:53.560
<i>We need to think about
what our next move will be.</i>

17:53.800 --> 17:56.280
<i>We must figure out a plan
and execute it.</i>

17:56.480 --> 17:59.290
<i>More importantly,
we need to get you two together.</i>

17:59.480 --> 18:04.122
<i>- You have to speak with him.
- Unfortunately, it didn't work.</i>

18:04.920 --> 18:06.604
<i>He's still alive.</i>

18:06.800 --> 18:09.565
<i>We're going to have to try
something else.</i>

18:09.880 --> 18:12.963
<i>I don't know. That seems risky.</i>

18:13.160 --> 18:17.484
<i>If those two guys
are who we think they are...</i>

18:17.680 --> 18:20.524
<i>- I am sorry.
- Six, seven, eight.</i>

18:20.720 --> 18:24.361
<i>Up, down.
Let's take it down, down, slow.</i>

18:24.560 --> 18:26.688
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

18:26.880 --> 18:28.245
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:29.811
<i>Take it lower.</i>

18:30.040 --> 18:31.280
<i>That's it, bring it up.</i>

18:31.440 --> 18:33.408
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

18:33.600 --> 18:35.489
<i>Down, down, slow.</i>

18:35.680 --> 18:38.889
<i>Arch your back. That's it.</i>

the office of president...</i>

18:52.920 --> 18:54.843
Come on this way.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.890
You're the king.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.881
Don't ever leave me.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.560
Don't ever leave me.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.928
Oh, I won't touch your babies.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.963
I won't touch your babies.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.326
I'll keep you nice and comfy here.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.847
Yes, you protect those babies.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.849
You protect those babies.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.408
Where are you?

19:36.960 --> 19:39.281
Where are you?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.251
No!

19:48.440 --> 19:51.603
No, no, no!

19:51.800 --> 19:53.609
No!

19:54.920 --> 19:56.365
I'm sorry.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.086
I'm sorry.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.245
No.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.409
<i>July 30th, 1994.</i>

22:25.600 --> 22:28.604
<i>Donna Hawthorne is brutally raped
and beaten to death...</i>

22:28.760 --> 22:31.240
<i>...by her ex-husband, Joseph Doucett.</i>

22:31.440 --> 22:34.683
<i>It's an open-and-shut case,
but there's just one problem.</i>

22:34.880 --> 22:37.611
<i>The killer has disappeared.</i>

22:37.800 --> 22:41.282
<i>For five years
Joe Doucett has eluded justice.</i>

22:41.800 --> 22:44.121
<i>Where could this fiend be hiding?</i>

22:44.320 --> 22:45.651
<i>I'm James Prestley.</i>

22:45.880 --> 22:49.327
<i>Tonight, we examine
this mystery of crime.</i>

22:50.880 --> 22:52.530
<i>What can you tell us about Mia?</i>

22:52.760 --> 22:54.330
<i>We adopted Mia
shortly after the tragedy.</i>

22:56.440 --> 22:59.649
<i>Neither her mother
or this Doucett murderer...</i>

22:59.800 --> 23:01.848
<i>...had any living relatives...</i>

23:02.040 --> 23:04.646
<i>...so we were lucky enough to...
- Blessed.</i>

23:05.440 --> 23:06.726
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:06.920 --> 23:11.528
<i>We were blessed to have this angel
come into our lives.</i>

23:11.720 --> 23:14.007
<i>- Does Mia know what happened?
- No.</i>

23:14.680 --> 23:18.207
<i>I mean, she knows she's adopted
and that her real mother is gone...</i>

23:18.400 --> 23:19.731
<i>...but no more than that.</i>

23:19.960 --> 23:22.361
<i>We're waiting until she's older
to tell her.</i>

23:22.560 --> 23:25.723
<i>I wanted to talk to Mia,
but instead, Ken and Shirley Roos...</i>

23:25.920 --> 23:28.287
<i>...let us watch their daughter
do what she loves best.</i>

23:57.720 --> 24:00.007
<i>"Dear daughter, dear Mia...</i>

24:00.200 --> 24:04.364
...I saw you on TV today.
You looked very pretty.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.531
When you played your cello,
it was so beautiful.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.050
I'm glad that you're happy.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.842
That you're being taken care of
by such nice people.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.405
I wish it were me.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.129
<i>I'm writing to you to tell you...</i>

24:20.560 --> 24:24.610
<i>- Lift your arms. Bend your right knee.
... that today I vow to change.</i>

24:24.800 --> 24:27.610
<i>And today, I pledge to fight
against the impulses...</i>

24:27.800 --> 24:29.689
<i>...that poison my body...</i>

24:29.880 --> 24:32.929
<i>- No, no, no.
... and my mind...</i>

24:33.120 --> 24:35.043
<i>...and my soul.</i>

24:35.640 --> 24:39.326

24:40.360 --> 24:41.486
<i>...for you...</i>

<i>...in hopes that one day
you will see me not for who I was...</i>

24:49.440 --> 24:51.363
<i>...but for who I am.
- Squeeze.</i>

24:51.560 --> 24:53.528
<i>- And I know that you hate me.
- Good.</i>

24:55.040 --> 24:56.405
<i>And I deserve your hate...</i>

25:00.120 --> 25:02.885
<i>...but not for the death of your mother.</i>

25:03.640 --> 25:05.529
No...

25:07.120 --> 25:08.963
<i>...I did not kill her.</i>

25:09.720 --> 25:15.523
I deserve your hate
because I was never a father to you.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.882
Until now. "

25:24.120 --> 25:26.088
<i>Five, four...</i>

in our history.</i>

29:06.120 --> 29:07.201
<i>Tonight...</i>

29:07.400 --> 29:10.847
<i>...the murder of Donna Hawthorne.
Tell me about your mother.</i>

<i>I don't remember my mother...</i>

29:13.600 --> 29:15.125
<i>...but I know I loved her.</i>

29:15.520 --> 29:17.682
<i>I know it in my heart and my soul.</i>

29:17.880 --> 29:19.166
<i>And your father?</i>

29:19.360 --> 29:20.850
<i>I don't remember him, either.</i>

29:22.760 --> 29:26.526
<i>- I'm sorry, that's not what I was asking.
- I hate him for what he did.</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:31.281
<i>No, there's a part of me
that hates him for what he did...</i>

29:31.480 --> 29:34.689
<i>...but there's another part
that wants to understand...</i>

29:35.120 --> 29:36.849
<i>...that wants to ask why.</i>

29:37.080 --> 29:43.440
<i>Your father's been missing for 20 years.
I don't know if you presume he's dead...</i>

29:43.640 --> 29:49.124
<i>...but if I could somehow bring him here,
do you think you could forgive him?</i>

29:53.680 --> 29:54.761
<i>I could try.</i>

30:03.120 --> 30:07.045
<i>Mia Roos is a beautiful
and very talented young woman...</i>

30:07.280 --> 30:11.842
<i>...but what's most impressive about her
is her gentle and compassionate spirit.</i>

30:12.080 --> 30:16.608
<i>I only hope that she's able to find
some kind of closure one day.</i>

30:16.800 --> 30:21.203
<i>This mystery may remain unsolved,
but one thing is clear.</i>

30:21.400 --> 30:24.165

Hey, slow down a second.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.690
Stop.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.450
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Hey!

32:25.320 --> 32:26.890
Leave the lady alone.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.045
Leave her the fuck alone.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.085
Stop! Stop! Wait!

32:45.320 --> 32:47.607
Please! No! No!

32:51.920 --> 32:53.331
No!

32:53.800 --> 32:56.201
Stop! Stop!

32:57.320 --> 32:59.721
Stop! Please!

33:00.520 --> 33:01.806
Please!

33:14.280 --> 33:16.248
Let him know I stopped by, all right?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.449
Hey. Where is she?

33:26.600 --> 33:27.726
Tell me where she is!

33:27.920 --> 33:29.684
- Don't hurt me!
- Where is she?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.166
Hey! Let him go!

33:31.400 --> 33:33.050
Jesus, let go of him!

33:34.000 --> 33:35.809
Jesus, Johnny, are you okay?

33:37.480 --> 33:40.290
If you wanna see the doctor,
respect the rules, okay?

33:40.480 --> 33:42.323
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.807
- I thought he was someone else.
- You okay?

33:45.040 --> 33:48.487
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

33:48.680 --> 33:52.844
That must be yours. Johnny takes things
that don't belong to him sometimes.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.329
I'm really sorry about that.
Hey, I'm Dr. Tom Melby. I run the clinic.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.681
I'm Joe Doakes.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.611
Johnny, can we give Mr. Doakes
his umbrella back?

34:01.800 --> 34:03.006
- Please?
- No.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.282
- No, he can keep it.
- You sure?

34:11.719 --> 34:14.371
Sir? Joe?

34:14.880 --> 34:19.043
Sorry. If you think that you might need
any medical help...

34:19.239 --> 34:21.049
...or, you know, if you just...

34:21.280 --> 34:24.681
If you just wanna talk to someone,
my name is Marie Sebastian.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.882
Please, take that.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.563
We're closed!

34:40.280 --> 34:42.521
Are you deaf? I said, we're closed!

<i>Twenty years in the same room?</i>

35:12.400 --> 35:15.688
<i>Jesus Christ,
I would have lost my mind.</i>

35:20.600 --> 35:22.284
Why?

35:22.760 --> 35:27.368
Why would somebody do that to you?
What could you have possibly done?

35:28.760 --> 35:31.206
Here, I think you could use this.

35:31.440 --> 35:35.445
- No, I'm fine with coffee.
- Well, what are you gonna do, Joe?

35:49.200 --> 35:51.441

- Hello, Joseph.</i>

35:51.760 --> 35:53.888

36:34.800 --> 36:39.283

36:39.440 --> 36:42.649
<i>- Mia has nothing to do with this.
- Anyway, I'll be in touch.</i>

36:44.240 --> 36:46.368
Was that him? Let me see.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.523
Blocked. What'd he say?

36:58.400 --> 37:00.641
I need your help, Chucky.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.083
Okay, Daniel Newcombe.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.005
Probably gonna be a lot
of Daniel Newcombes.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.965
He owned a bunch of car dealerships.

that's a very long list.

- I know. Bernard Sharkey.

- Yeah.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.166
Why is he on the list?

37:36.360 --> 37:39.284
Because he was my boss.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.249
- Yeah. This guy?
- Okay.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can check him out.

37:43.720 --> 37:47.247
- What'd he do?
- Oh, it's what I did, not what he did.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.601
Save him.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.280
What do you have to do?
Just write it in there?

37:51.440 --> 37:55.604
Yeah. You write whatever you want

38:59.720 --> 39:02.610
Yeah, he'll be fine.
He just needs to rest.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.849
Guy's exhausted.
He's also malnourished and dehydrated.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.050
What happened to him?

39:08.280 --> 39:11.011
He showed up last night
completely out of the blue.

39:11.240 --> 39:15.165
I haven't seen the guy in 20 years.
I didn't even recognize him at first.

39:16.200 --> 39:20.524
Comes inside, we sit down,
he starts telling me this crazy story.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.324
What's the story?

39:23.720 --> 39:26.485
- How do you know him?
- I don't.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.967
- You don't.
- Well, what's the story?

39:29.160 --> 39:31.731
I said enough already.
I don't know who you are.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.651
- Come on, Chucky! It's 9:00 already!
- Shit.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.330
Okay, I gotta open the joint.

39:36.720 --> 39:40.850
Okay. I'm gonna stick around
and make sure he's all right for a while.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.642
Hold your horses.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.442
<i>Dear daughter, dear Mia...</i>

40:16.920 --> 40:20.766
<i>...I have been unjustly held in this
god-awful place for almost 20 years.</i>

40:20.960 --> 40:24.487
<i>When I'm free of this place,
and I will be free of it...</i>

40:24.680 --> 40:26.887
<i>...my purpose will be simple and pure.</i>

40:27.080 --> 40:29.367
<i>I intend to prove my love for you.</i>

40:29.520 --> 40:32.000
<i>To do this,
I must find the man who put me here.</i>

40:32.200 --> 40:33.247
<i>I am your father.</i>

40:33.440 --> 40:34.771
<i>Now it is my duty...</i>

40:34.960 --> 40:37.008
<i>...now it is my responsibility...</i>

40:37.240 --> 40:38.446
<i>...to take care of you.</i>

40:38.640 --> 40:41.723
<i>To love you, Mia.
Please give me that chance.</i>

40:41.960 --> 40:47.285
<i>The world can be a cold, ugly place,
and people can be cruel and deceitful.</i>

40:47.480 --> 40:49.687
<i>But never let that change who you are.</i>

40:49.920 --> 40:53.049
<i>One day I will be there
to share it with you.</i>

40:53.240 --> 40:55.891
<i>Love, Daddy.</i>

40:57.400 --> 40:58.765
You read them?

40:58.960 --> 41:00.883
You read my letters?

41:01.080 --> 41:03.003
You had no right!

41:03.200 --> 41:05.043
Who the fuck are you?

41:05.240 --> 41:07.846
Chucky called me
because you were in bad shape.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.647
- I'm all right now, you can get out.
- No, you're far from all right.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.649
What are you doing here?

41:14.120 --> 41:16.885
I apologize for reading your letters.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.525
You didn't call the police?

41:20.720 --> 41:22.768
- No, I didn't.
- Why?

41:23.480 --> 41:26.290
- I believe you.
- Why?

41:26.760 --> 41:31.243
I believe that you've been locked up
for a long time.

41:31.960 --> 41:35.407
Okay? I believe you want to be a father
to your daughter.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.726
Don't touch me.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.321
And that you want to prove your love
to her.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.171
- Okay.
- I said, don't touch me.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.686
Okay.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.247
What if I thought
you knew too much, huh?

41:47.480 --> 41:49.562
Reading my letters.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.647
What if I felt
like I needed to kill you right now?

41:55.200 --> 41:57.851
Then I suppose I'd be dead.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.085
Joe...

42:01.280 --> 42:05.001
...please take your hands off me.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.167
If you are trying to find your daughter...

42:17.360 --> 42:22.127
...and clear your name, I could help you.
Or let me take you to people who can.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.847
There are social workers, legal aid,
even cops I trust.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.247
No, I don't need your help.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.206
Bernard Sharkey.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.404
Bernard. He's up the stairs.
It's nice of y'all to come.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.364
He doesn't get many visitors.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.450
- Thank you.
- Bye. Enjoy.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.762
Sorry, boss.

43:12.120 --> 43:15.522
- How do you know that's not him?
- He seems happy.

43:15.840 --> 43:19.049
The one who called me doesn't know
what happy means.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.411
- What?
- I need Yellow Pages.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.206
- Where are all the payphones?
- No. Okay. Hold on.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.488
- What are you looking for?
- A restaurant.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.211
- Okay.
- It's called Dragon something.

43:37.520 --> 43:39.249
There. Here.

43:46.360 --> 43:49.284
- Five dollar.
- Sir, buy something for your girlfriend.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.847
Only $5.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.042
Buy anything, $5.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.730
I have to go.
I have a shift, I can't just not show up.

44:40.880 --> 44:42.530
I put my number in your phone.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.007
<i>- I'll be free all day tomorrow.
- Thank you.</i>

45:33.240 --> 45:36.050
- The usual, sir?
- Yep. Thank you.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.848
- Yeah.
- Put it on the bill.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.327
Have a good day. See you tomorrow.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.968
Where's my next order?

46:04.760 --> 46:07.240
Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir!

47:31.960 --> 47:33.166
<i>Hey-</i>

47:55.840 --> 47:58.571
You know the drill. Put it on the table.

47:58.960 --> 48:02.089
Thirty-nine across.
"Alter ego of Edmond Dantés. "

48:03.480 --> 48:04.845
The Count of Monte Cristo.

48:17.480 --> 48:20.484
Hello. It's time to feed the pets.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.684
F- O-O-D. F-O-O-D.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.845
Goddamn,
these motherfuckers don't do shit.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.168
Hey, what's up with the...?

48:30.120 --> 48:34.523
Let me up out of here, motherfucker. Me
and you, man-to-man. Come on. Let's go.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.046
Shit.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.447
You want some get back,
then let me get up.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.490
Me and you can go at it, motherfucker.
How about it?

48:41.680 --> 48:42.727
Hold still.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.329
What the fuck are you doing?

48:45.880 --> 48:47.609
What the fuck are you doing?

48:47.960 --> 48:50.611
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up.

48:51.120 --> 48:53.282
There we go.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.161
Are you ready?

48:57.600 --> 48:59.762
Might wanna think about
what you're doing.

49:00.280 --> 49:03.045
I've been thinking about it
for the last 20 years.

49:03.520 --> 49:04.931
- Wait. What...?
- Hold still.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.326
Cocksucker.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.762
Motherfucker.

49:12.400 --> 49:13.526
Shit.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.683
You no dick, ass-licking son of a bitch!

49:17.880 --> 49:19.928
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

49:20.800 --> 49:24.043
You booger-eating,
piss-drinking motherfucker.

49:24.920 --> 49:28.811
If you stop now,
you may get out of here alive.

49:30.720 --> 49:32.882
I'm gonna keep going...

49:33.080 --> 49:36.323
...till I can pull your head off
with my bare hands.

49:36.520 --> 49:37.760
Okay?

49:37.960 --> 49:40.611
Listen to me. Listen to me.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.531
I only run this place, all right?

49:43.720 --> 49:46.166
I was hired to keep you here.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.407
Who hired you?

49:48.280 --> 49:50.806
- I can't tell you that.
- Then do me a favor...

49:50.960 --> 49:53.088
...and shut the fuck up.

50:12.680 --> 50:13.920
Who hired you?

50:14.120 --> 50:17.408
I don't know his fucking name!

50:17.960 --> 50:20.406
- Who hired you?
- No, no, no.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.289
I swear. I swear it's the truth.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.450
It's the truth. I never ask their names.

50:26.760 --> 50:29.081
They never tell.

50:34.920 --> 50:37.287
Oh, goddamn you, motherfucker!

50:39.720 --> 50:41.688
God...! Oh, goddamn!

50:43.120 --> 50:46.841
Oh, no. Oh, please. Please.

50:51.280 --> 50:54.523
- I know you're gonna tell me something.
- I don't know shit.

50:54.720 --> 50:58.520
I swear before God and eight
motherfucking white people, all right?

50:58.720 --> 51:01.200
- Look. Look.
- No, no, no.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.880
No, no, no.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.849
- The tapes. The tapes.
- Where?

51:06.080 --> 51:08.526
Over there in the cabinet. Go, look.

51:10.480 --> 51:13.450
First one. Right there.
Go look. Right there.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.449
Right there, right there.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.369
First cabinet.

51:17.560 --> 51:20.086
Second shelf, third tray, first cassette.

51:21.280 --> 51:24.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That one. That one.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.964
"Tape one. Doucett. "

51:26.160 --> 51:29.323
Go ahead, play it. Listen to it.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.481
I don't know who he is.
I never get names.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.330
I swear.

51:38.480 --> 51:43.327
<i>Sir, for a very long time, we have served
a very elite group of clients.</i>

51:43.520 --> 51:46.683
<i>Now, I surmise that you've encountered
one such individual.</i>

51:46.880 --> 51:49.247
<i>That's the only way
you received this number.</i>

51:49.640 --> 51:50.801
<i>Correct.</i>

51:51.040 --> 51:56.444
Sir, this business existed
long before my tenure...

51:56.640 --> 51:59.530
...and will continue long after I'm gone.

52:00.040 --> 52:03.726
<i>Never has a released guest
made its existence known...</i>

52:03.880 --> 52:05.450
<i>...to the outside world.</i>

52:05.680 --> 52:07.603
- You've convinced me.
- Good.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.768
How long will we have the pleasure...

52:09.960 --> 52:13.726
...of entertaining this Mr. Doucett
as a guest?

52:13.920 --> 52:15.285
<i>Twenty years.</i>

52:28.440 --> 52:30.727
Get your asses up here now.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.051
Open the door!

52:38.240 --> 52:39.810
'See?

52:40.000 --> 52:41.126
I told you.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.606
Well, do we?

52:42.840 --> 52:45.764
- You tell those motherfuckers...
- Tell them what?

52:47.720 --> 52:49.449
Get the fuck away from the door!

52:49.680 --> 52:51.330
Move away from the fucking door!

52:51.800 --> 52:54.610
You hear me say get away?
Get away from the door.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.370
Back the fuck up! Back up!

52:56.560 --> 52:58.164
All right!

52:58.400 --> 53:00.562
Easy. Easy now. Back up!

53:00.760 --> 53:03.889
Easy. Easy.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.560
You're not gonna get away with this,
Joe.

53:06.760 --> 53:10.207
Back up.
Easy. Easy. Easy, Joe.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.528
- Now!
- Get him!

53:13.600 --> 53:17.241
- Get his ass! He killed Marco?
- Yeah, yeah, they killed Marco.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.687
Son of a bitch.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.891
Fuck!

56:06.680 --> 56:08.523
Oh, my God.

56:08.760 --> 56:11.161
You must take care of yourself.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.124
The fun is only just beginning.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.165
Joe.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.686
What the fuck happened?

56:25.880 --> 56:27.086
Come on.

56:27.320 --> 56:28.560
Come on, Joe.

56:46.480 --> 56:47.527
Hello?

56:53.080 --> 56:55.686
Marie, he needs to stay down
for at least a week.

56:55.880 --> 56:59.726
Keep movement to a minimum because
we don't wanna tear out those sutures.

56:59.920 --> 57:03.845
He lost a lot of blood, but if he
stays down, he should be all right.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.651
Half a centimeter difference
on some lacerations...

57:06.800 --> 57:08.848
...it could've been a different story.

57:09.360 --> 57:11.328
I really appreciate this, Tom.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.000
You should let me take him
to the hospital.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.362
- Well, you can't.
- Why not?

57:19.080 --> 57:23.244
Somebody tried to kill him. Isn't that
something we should call the police over?

57:23.400 --> 57:25.482
Well, I'm asking you not to.

57:25.680 --> 57:29.287
He isn't a stray dog
or a bird with a broken wing, Marie.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.608
I know that you love your lost causes...

57:32.400 --> 57:37.361
...but sometimes we meet people
who can get us to engage in old thinking.

57:37.560 --> 57:41.326
So, what, you think I'm using again?
Is that what you think?

57:42.680 --> 57:44.250
Fuck you.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.404
Come in.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.166
Hey. Just wanted to see
if you were feeling all right.

58:14.600 --> 58:20.801
I just wanna take a look at that wound
on your back really quickly, if that's okay.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.764
Just turn around here.

58:22.960 --> 58:24.610
Sorry.

58:25.320 --> 58:26.446
Okay.

58:26.840 --> 58:31.528
Well, it looks like the bleeding
has stopped, so that's a good sign.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.248
I can't tell you what to do.
And I can't tell Marie either.

58:39.080 --> 58:42.289
But I can tell you this.
She's been through a lot.

58:42.480 --> 58:46.690
And if there's one thing that she doesn't
need any more of from anyone...

58:46.880 --> 58:48.370
...it's pain.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.761
Please don't hurt her.

59:00.880 --> 59:02.803
He likes you.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.727
Do you like him?

59:11.160 --> 59:14.767
No. That was a long time ago.

59:16.560 --> 59:19.006
Well, he still likes you.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.845
I got your suit cleaned for you.

59:24.920 --> 59:29.403
They didn't...
They didn't patch up the hole.

59:33.240 --> 59:36.210
Can I help you? Here.

59:51.280 --> 59:55.683
Well, I think you should go.

59:56.320 --> 59:58.402
Come on, go.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.929
Come on, get out of here.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.210
- Go.
- Are you serious?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.324
Don't come back. Go.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.170
Come on, go.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.408
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
last call for alcohol.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.890
Speak up or forever hold your peace.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.730
Hello?

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.210
Hello.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.567
Hello. I thought it was time we met.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.326
Hey!

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.884
Hey! What the...?

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.447
- Cool. Be cool.
- All right, all right.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.206
Kill me now...

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.844
...and die seconds later
never knowing why.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.886
Stop it!

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.686
I have your daughter.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.008
If you'd like to see her alive again...

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.811
...I hope we can continue
without the violence.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.483
May I see your list?

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.930
No.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.964
It's of no use to you, trust me.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.886
I have a proposition for you, Joseph.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.405
If you should accept and succeed,
you will be greatly rewarded.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.321
Firstly, with a video tape recording...

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.444
...of the rape and murder of your wife...

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.768
...Donna Hawthorne.
- No! No!

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.325
Oh, God, no.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.368
- No. I don't wanna watch it.
- No!

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.449
<i>- Please.
- Turn it off.</i>

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.087
<i>Say goodbye. Say goodbye.</i>

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.691
- Turn it off. Turn it off.
- Very well.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.127
Secondly,
my handwritten confession...

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.691
...to that crime
and your kidnapping and imprisonment.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.922
Thirdly, and this is my favorite one...

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.609
...20 million dollars in diamonds.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:51.567
Lastly, and again,
this is only if you should succeed...

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.931
...I will put a bullet through my brain...

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.367
...and you can watch.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.801
Answer two questions.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:05.770
One, who am I?

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.729
And two,
why did I imprison you for 20 years?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.290
If you provide satisfactory answers
to both of these questions...

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.924
...in little more than 46 hours from now,
you win.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.807
Refusal of the challenge
brings the same result as failure.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.287
You stay a fugitive from justice...

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.326
...you get no reward, no closure...

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.444
...and I kill your daughter.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.331
If you or anyone you know
should go to the police...

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.723
...or try to warn Mia,
the consequences will be severe.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.365
Especially for her.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.484
If you doubt the extent of my will
or my reach...

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.526
...I suggest you look in
on your friend Marie.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.244
That is a live broadcast.
My proposition, yes or no?

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.167
Yes.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.160
It's 629 Cooper Street,
and you'd better hurry.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.250
Marie.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.123
Marie. Marie.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.970
Hey, Joe.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.650
I was gonna let Cortez here
have some fun with her.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.320
But now that you're here...

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.927
...the bitch can wait.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.041
- Let's get him up on the table.
- Come on.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.130
Let's go. Let's go.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.727
Pull him up.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.605
The last person
that got the better of me...

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.604
...I tracked her funky ass down...

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.044
...and tortured her for 16 fucking days.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.449
Now, compared
to what I'm about to do to you...

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.962
...that was like an ant
fucking an elephant.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.405
Yes?

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.969
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.925
Reparations must be made.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.206
Indeed it was you
who gave me this address...

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.164
...and I appreciate that, but...

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.407
No. No, there's nothing you can give me
that will stop me...

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.331
"Go to the door. "

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.611
Cortez.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.484
Cortez.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.285
Move.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.562
Oh, well, maybe I can...

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.523
- I thank you for your generosity, sir.
- Damn.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.486
And thank you
for appreciating my sacrifice.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.522
Yes, sir. You have a good evening too.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.204
You are a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.686
Let's go.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.125
I'm sorry.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.888
I'm sorry.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.884
Hey. Hey. He)'-

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.646
It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.482
I have a friend downtown, so I can...

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.043
I can stay with her.
I don't feel safe here anymore.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.529
Hello?

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.362
Every time he calls,
the same music plays.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.121
Evergreen Academy.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.921
Have you ever heard of that?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.569
The prep school I went to.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.084
This is so weird, I can't find anything.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.122
Here's something.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:08.720
Who's Edwina Burke?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.004
She was the headmistress.
She might know something.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.328
I used to drink a lot.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.125
Yeah, well, I used to drink, and I also
did a shitload of other stuff, but...

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.526
Tonight was actually... It was the first time
that I wanted to use again.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.487
I'm glad you're here.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.607
Miss Burke?
Edwina Burke from Evergreen Academy?

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.050
- Yes.
- I was wondering if I could talk to you...

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.965
...about a former student? Joe Doucett.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.921
<i>- Come'm.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.</i>

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.370
<i>Not at all. I was just making some tea.
Please, sit.</i>

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.844
<i>Joseph Deuce.</i>

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.051
- Do you remember him?
- Of course.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.406
We had many students gain notoriety,
but he was our only murderer.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.008
- Thank God.
- Well, what if I told you...

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.966
...that Joe Doucett is innocent
and another man killed his wife?

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.401
Someone he knew at Evergreen.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.967
Why don't you tell me who you are?

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.848
I'm sorry. My name's Marie Sebastian.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.805
Have you heard
of the Innocence Project?

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.329
The Innocence Project
works with convicted felons.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.410
Joseph disappeared 20 years ago.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.923
Excuse me.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.243
You really think he didn't do it?

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.683
We have evidence
that suggests he was framed.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.405
That comes as some relief.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.126
He was a very handsome boy.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.688
Terrible student,
but Donna adored him...

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.207
...but he never appreciated that or her.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.802
He was the kind of boy
who thought very highly of himself...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.206
...and no one else.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.366
In fact, he could be quite cruel
to the others.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.086
Always with a grin, as if it were a joke.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.522
I always felt he was a bit of a lost soul.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.848
You said you thought
it might be another student?

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.251
- I'm assuming Joe had enemies?
- Many.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.047
But for one to do something so horrible?

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.483
That would require
a very deep level of hatred.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.967
Well, was there someone?

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.127
Anyone like that?

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.683
I honestly don't remember.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.046
I drove by the academy this morning.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.800
What happened?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.286
They took it from him.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.211
My father built it brick by brick.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.768
The board of directors sold it
to some faceless corporation...

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.123
...and the gates have been locked
ever since.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.526
It's all still there.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.645
Files, records,
the entire history of the school...

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.326
."abandoned.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.520
- Bye.
- Marie.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.521
When you first arrived,
you said you believe Joe is innocent...

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.245
...not was.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.130
I assumed he was dead.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.249
Thank you.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.610
God, you went to school here?

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.040
A long time ago.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.001
- Let's come back tonight.
- Okay.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.807
- Hello?
- I didn't know him back then.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.809
I don't even recognize the name.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.968
Your friends? Maybe they know him.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.801
I haven't seen those assholes in years.
I doubt they'd talk to me.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.924
I hated everything
about that fucking place, except you.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.249
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- No, there's nothing to be sorry about.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.442
Let me see what I can find out. Okay?

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.165
All right.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.729
We should change your bandage.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.084
- Need help?
- Yeah, please.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.124
Sister?

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.563
<i>The party you have called
is not available. Leave a message.</i>

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.083
<i>Joe, it's Chucky.
Call me as soon as you get this.</i>

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.205
<i>It's not about him, it's about her.
The whore, remember?</i>

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.562
<i>Jesus, Joe, call me.</i>

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.331
Chucky?

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.806
Chucky?

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.209
You called her a whore.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.442
You called her a whore!

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.930
Whore! Whore! Whore!

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.727
Adrian Pryce. Adrian Pryce.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.649
I got it.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.525
"As we begin our preparation
for the new year, I'd like to call attention...

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.641
...to the arrival of a new legacy student
from the Pryce family, Amanda Pryce. "

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.689
Will you check for Amanda?

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.524
Nineteen eighty-six.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.444
I got it.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.644
Amanda Pryce.
"It has come to my attention...

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.969
...that the Pryce family
is relocating to Luxembourg. "

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.601
Do you remember her?

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.045
Now, hold on.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.369
Freshwomen should be in their rooms.
This is a serious infraction.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.444
- Give it back to me.
- Hey, Joe, leave her alone.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:59.211
- If she wants to go, let her go.
- Donna, shut up.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.609
This is sexy. Very sexy. Huh, Chucky?

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.083
- Give it back to me.
- What a fucking freak.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.569
- Here, douche bag.
- Disgusting.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.486
- Hey.
- Come on.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.320
Joe, let her through.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.241
What dorm number are you in?

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.801
Come on, let her go.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.485
- Really?
- That bitch.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.045
Chucky, shut the fuck up.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.887
- You gonna let her talk to me like that?
- I don't care, I'm drunk.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.047
Now, let's get back.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.726
I can't be missed.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.643
Here you go.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.211
There.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.641
"Family Tragedy in Luxembourg. "

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.411
<i>We are in the midst
of a most unpleasant mess.</i>

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.644
<i>The crime scene indicates
a double murder, suicide...</i>

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.491
<i>...and one
seriously injured young man.</i>

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.411
<i>The names cannot be released
at this time...</i>

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.967
<i>...awaiting the family identification.</i>

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.010
"Son Tells Tale of Murder. "

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.443
That's him.
The man in the greenhouse that night.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.404
He was her father.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:09.002
Chucky, where are you? Call me.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.404
If he kills you,
you're not gonna see your daughter.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.125
Okay? And if you kill him...

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.489
...you're still not going
to see your daughter.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.002
Just don't go.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.166
I don't have a choice.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.129
Please.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.448
I don't want you to go.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.324
Listen to me.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.490
You promise me
you'll stay in this room.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.085
<i>Hey-</i>

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.203
Don't call anyone...

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.767
...don't talk to anyone.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.164
You stay.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.202
Will you promise?

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.484
Yes.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.249
<i>- This is Dr. Tom Melby.
- Listen carefully to what I tell you.</i>

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.768
- Is Marie okay?
- Write this down, you'll need directions.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.566
I'm ready. Tell me where to go.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.690
Where's Mia?

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.727
Where's Mia?

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.290
There.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.247
Where? Where is she?

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.324
Here.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.528
Quite close by, actually.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.768
But you will not see her...

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.521
...you will not save her
until I have your answers.

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.851
Please put that away.
She will suffer great pain if you do not.

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.849
Your reward.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.170
As I said, I'm a man of my word.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.724
So who am I?

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.844
Adrian Doyle Pryce.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.040
Why did I imprison you for 20 years?

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.084
- You blame me for what happened.
- Elaborate.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:14.320
I saw your sister with a man,
down at the greenhouse.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.007
"They were fucking.
They were fucking. "

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.408
- Isn't that what you told everyone?
- Yes.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.322
I told Donna.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.161
I told Chucky, I told half of Evergreen.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.487
Gossip spreads like the plague.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.763
- Amanda's a whore! Whore! Whore!
- Stop it!

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.766
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Leave me alone!

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.526
- Chucky! Stop it now!
- Whore! Whore! Whore!

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.166
- Chucky! Stop it now!
- I didn't do anything!

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.684
You have no idea how difficult it was
for Amanda then.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.044
The torture that she endured,
all because of you.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.766
Continue.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.645
I didn't know it was your father
until today.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.201
The school must have found out
what was going on...

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.325
...and he got your family out of the States
as fast as possible.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.569
I'm only guessing,
but running didn't help.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.922
He must've been afraid
of what was coming.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.124
You know nothing of my father.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.126
He knew no fear, only love.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.562
Arthur Pryce was a great man.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.367
He will always be a great man.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.082
What we had together...

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.287
...was beautiful and special and pure.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.722
<i>My father did what he did
to honor and preserve that.</i>

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.764
Father.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.563
Father.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.286
Daddy.

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.409
<i>My father loved my mother.</i>

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.483
Daddy.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.483
<i>He loved my sister.</i>

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.845
<i>And he loved me.</i>

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.483
You see, Joseph,
my sister Amanda and I thought...

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.564
...that what we had with my father
would last forever.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.885
That nobody could take it from us.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.371
And yet, you did.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.524
And, yes...

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.047
...that is why I imprisoned you
for 20 years.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.527
It seems you've won, Mr. Doucett.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.485
Take me to Mia.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.206
Yes, of course.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.800
Do you know what I find fascinating,
Joseph?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.368
All this time,
you never stopped to ask...

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:23.206
...the most fundamental question of all.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.843
Why did I let you go?

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.320
Mind your head.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.447
Introducing one of the longest-running
shows on television...

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.849
...but it had only a single viewer.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.244
You.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.087
<i>We adopted Mia
shortly after the tragedy.</i>

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:54.409
<i>Neither her mother
or this Doucett murderer...</i>

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.847
<i>...had any living relatives.</i>

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.042
<i>- So we were lucky enough to...
- Blessed.</i>

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.480
<i>Yes, we were blessed.</i>

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.971
Isn't it amazing?

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.846
People just believe whatever they see
on television.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.687
Thank you, Ashley. You can go.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.850
What...?

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.921
- Joseph.
- No. No. Mia.

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.410
Mia!

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.689
Mia!

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.689
Oh, Joseph.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.601
Joseph, that is not your daughter.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.962
Ashley is a musician...

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.686
...and very well paid actress...

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:17.807
...that I've had in my employ
since she was 10 years old.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.407
Oh, goodness.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:24.566
Enough with the games.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.842
You tell me where she is. You tell me.

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:32.042
Answer the question you never asked.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.611
Why did I let you go?

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.767
You tell me. You tell me.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.851
You know the answer, Joseph.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.925
In your heart of hearts, you know...

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.964
...the plain and simple truth.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.847
- Mia. Mia.
- It took a while...

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.244
<i>- Mia. Where are you going?
... to change her name...</i>

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:14.127
...her records...

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.128
...to find the right parents.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.250
An insensitive mother...

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:30.286
...a loving father
taken from her too soon.

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.804
It took 20 years to create her.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.723
A sensitive, caring woman...

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.321
...eager to help those in need...

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.883
...because she herself had overcome...

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.283
...such a troubled past.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.009
The kind of woman who couldn't help...

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.240
...but fall in love with a man like you...

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.282
<i>Joseph Deuce“..</i>

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.250
No!

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.762
No, no, no! God!

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.089
No, God, no, please, no!

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.490
Please, God, no!

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.162
- Joe? Joe?
- No way, no way, no!

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.441
No, no, no.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:43.565
No, no, no.
You can't hurt her.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:45.086
Who is this?

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.760
Leave her out of it, please. Please.

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.725
- Who is this?
- Please, please, please.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.206
No, don't hurt her.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.648
Hurt me. Hurt me.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.764
Kill me. Yes, yes, yes.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.281
Yes. Kill me. Please.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:06.410
- Please kill me.
- I don't want to kill you, Joseph.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.843
This is why I let you go.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:19.650
So that I could experience
this moment with you.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.691
So that you could truly understand
what I had...

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.447
...and what you took from me.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.925
Heaven make me free of it.

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.442
The rest is silence.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.924
<i>"Dear Marie,
you will never see me again.</i>

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.562
<i>I'm gone from your life forever.</i>

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:30.971
<i>I have done something terrible.</i>

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.848
<i>Something unforgivable.</i>

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.683
<i>And for it, I must be punished.</i>

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.251
<i>For a short while, I was happy...</i>

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.808
<i>...because of you.</i>

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.451
<i>And I will cherish that happiness forever.</i>

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.926
<i>Marie, I will love you, always.</i>

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.247
<i>But you must forget me.</i>

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.925
<i>Do not waste one more moment
of your life thinking about me.</i>

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.003
<i>I want you to be with someone
who will care for you...</i>

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.323
<i>...watch over you, bring you joy...</i>

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.522
<i>...not pain.</i>

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.928
<i>I want you to find happiness
with a good man...</i>

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.124
<i>...who has a good heart.</i>

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.330
<i>A man unlike me.</i>

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.768
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.328
<i>Joe.</i>
