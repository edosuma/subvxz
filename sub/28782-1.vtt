we can all be free.

just a few words.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.457

One's from me, and the other
is from Frances Boudreaux.

She sends
Violet her best.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.546
You and Frances
are friends?

14:39.580 --> 14:42.649
Landry Enterprises
made a sizable donation

14:42.683 --> 14:43.650
to my re‐election.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.619
I thought you knew about that.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.689
You are still a partner?

14:48.722 --> 14:51.391
I don't own enough shares
to attend board meetings.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.561
I get the minutes
and an occasional check.

14:54.595 --> 14:55.562
That's it.

14:55.596 --> 14:57.097
Kevin asked me
to talk to you

14:57.130 --> 14:58.699
about setting up
a re‐entry program.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.634
I already got a worker.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.938
I don't see how I could need
much more help.

15:04.971 --> 15:08.174
Now, look, you got a farm
and it's harvest time.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.576
It needs working.

15:09.610 --> 15:12.045
It may as well be
someone you know

15:12.078 --> 15:14.147
needs a second chance.

15:16.683 --> 15:20.120
Frances has certainly been
very generous as of late.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.688
Hmm.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.624
She even paid
for my new consultant.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.592
Really?

15:25.626 --> 15:27.661
Well, you know,
we do what we need to do

15:27.694 --> 15:29.195
in order to get
the job done.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.964
In the end,

15:30.997 --> 15:35.468
as long as it benefits St. Jo's,
that's all I care about.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.739
Now if you'll
excuse me,

15:38.772 --> 15:40.440
I'm going to go give
Violet my love.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.675
Yeah.

for not giving up on you.

15:54.655 --> 15:55.488
I'm telling you,

Slow down.

gonna be here?

a plate before you go.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.158
You ain't have
to do her like that.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.493
What? I didn't do nothing
to that child.

17:07.528 --> 17:10.330
I said hi, took her gift,
and offered her a plate.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.331
What else you want?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.799
She's trying.

trying to raise Blue together.

to raise your standards,

I respect that.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.674
Yeah?

22:20.707 --> 22:23.043
Because if you even
writing about 25%

22:23.076 --> 22:24.811
of the family secrets
that I know,

22:24.845 --> 22:27.581
then we need
to be prepared.

22:28.749 --> 22:30.050
You owe us that,
at least.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.588
In the pot right here.

22:46.066 --> 22:48.401
‐[birds tweeting]
‐[wind growling]

22:55.509 --> 22:57.744
[wind roaring]

23:04.685 --> 23:07.020
[chain creaking]

23:07.053 --> 23:09.122
[children laughing]

23:12.225 --> 23:13.894
[Young Nova]
You ain't gonna tag me, Charley.

23:13.927 --> 23:15.495
Better get after
little Ralph Angel.

23:15.529 --> 23:18.131
Nova, be for real.
He's too easy to catch.

23:19.666 --> 23:23.436
Am not. I can tag y'all too.
Just play fair.

23:24.538 --> 23:26.206
I always play fair.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.041
‐Really, Nova?
‐[Trudy] Nova!

23:28.074 --> 23:30.777
Charley! Ralph Angel!
Dinners ready!

23:30.811 --> 23:32.445
Yes, Mama. Coming.

23:32.478 --> 23:33.346
Playtime's over.

23:33.379 --> 23:35.882
Come on, race you
to the front porch.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.485
[all laughing]

23:47.561 --> 23:49.763
[wind gusting]

[groans]

24:42.248 --> 24:43.850
[sighs]

24:47.320 --> 24:49.022
Did you like it?

24:51.091 --> 24:53.560
Stop fishing
for compliments.

24:53.594 --> 24:55.529
You know I did.

24:55.562 --> 24:58.732
I'm not. I'm just saying I could
use less pimento next time.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.133
‐Wow, less pimento.
‐Yeah.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.135
Makes all the difference.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.574
Look, I don't want
to assume anything.

25:08.308 --> 25:11.578
We had a great time
over the summer.

25:11.612 --> 25:15.181
But Micah's coming home
tomorrow, and‐‐

25:15.215 --> 25:16.550
And what?

25:17.951 --> 25:20.053
Our summer romance is over?

25:21.187 --> 25:22.656
Stop.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.891
It's...

25:24.925 --> 25:27.327
I just know it's a...

25:27.360 --> 25:30.063
a big deal to introduce me
to him, is all.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.000
See, that's what
I love about you.

25:34.935 --> 25:36.036
Love?

25:36.069 --> 25:39.272
What I appreciate
about you

25:39.305 --> 25:42.543
is how thoughtful you are.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.047
But, honestly, I'm not even
thinking about next steps.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.616
I'm just...

25:51.384 --> 25:53.687
living for the moment.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.121
Is this new for you?

25:59.359 --> 26:01.995
But that doesn't mean
I want it to stop.

26:02.763 --> 26:04.665
This.

26:04.698 --> 26:06.132
Us.

26:10.704 --> 26:12.105
Neither do I.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.109
I have harvest.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.679
And then the dinner event.

26:18.712 --> 26:19.846
Mm‐hmm.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.648
What is it called again?

26:22.849 --> 26:24.985
The Boss Women of NOLA.

26:28.722 --> 26:30.156
What?

26:31.191 --> 26:32.826
I think it sounds
kind of hot.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.360
Women in charge?

26:34.394 --> 26:35.762
Yeah.

26:35.796 --> 26:37.631
Well, get to work.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.666
[laughs]

26:43.403 --> 26:46.106
[Ralph Angel]
Come on, come on.

26:46.139 --> 26:49.242
Ah, I like that
little flair.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.944
A bit up like that.
You got to catch that thing.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.079
‐I can catch it on the run.
‐I know you can catch it.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.715
All right,
you a big boy now?

26:54.748 --> 26:56.917
‐Yeah.
‐All right, go far.

26:56.950 --> 26:59.653
Go long now. Come on, Blue.
Go far.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.021
That's a perfect throw.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.656
I got it!

27:02.689 --> 27:04.758
‐Oh!
‐That was for me to catch.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.860
You weren't going to get it,
butterfingers.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.228
So, finders keepers.

27:08.261 --> 27:09.963
You better give me
back my ball.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.297
Take it.

27:11.331 --> 27:13.399
Joie, give that nice boy
back his ball.

27:13.433 --> 27:15.435
‐It's all good.
‐[Joie] Want to play "fight"?

27:15.468 --> 27:20.306
Or how about we just
go use the bouncy house instead?

27:20.340 --> 27:21.407
Okay.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.410
Hey, be good, Blue.

27:24.444 --> 27:25.946
And be nice.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.914
I mean it.

27:27.948 --> 27:29.382
Joie can...

27:29.415 --> 27:32.385
be without boundaries
sometimes.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.220
That's cool, honestly.

27:34.254 --> 27:35.922
Blue's kind of easy.

27:35.956 --> 27:37.791
Blue?

27:37.824 --> 27:39.025
Yeah. Blue.

27:39.059 --> 27:40.360
That's a wonderful name.

27:40.393 --> 27:43.730
It's strong. Creative.

27:43.764 --> 27:44.931
Full of feeling.

27:44.965 --> 27:47.133
I like it.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.770
It's kind of beautiful, huh?

27:49.803 --> 27:51.271
Just like him.

27:52.372 --> 27:56.176
Of course, half the girls
Joie plays with

27:56.209 --> 27:57.811
think she's too tough.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.814
She's a one‐play‐date‐and‐out
kind of girl.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.049
Yeah, well,
my boy plays with dolls, so...

28:03.083 --> 28:04.484
I get it.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.853
It's cool you're good
with that.

28:06.887 --> 28:08.454
It's a toy.

28:08.488 --> 28:11.157
Kids play with toys.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.760
I'm Deesha. Brown‐Sonnier.

28:13.794 --> 28:15.896
Grew up not too far
from here.

28:15.929 --> 28:17.230
St. Thomas.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.900
‐St. Thomas? All right.
‐Mm‐hmm.

28:19.933 --> 28:22.168
I'm Ralph Angel.

28:22.202 --> 28:24.270
Bordelon.

28:24.304 --> 28:26.773
The Johnsons are three hours
late for their mill time?

28:26.807 --> 28:29.810
No, no, get them on the phone.
They can't back us up like that.

28:29.843 --> 28:30.877
Yes, ma'am.

28:30.911 --> 28:33.146
Nova? Everything okay?

28:33.179 --> 28:34.781
Yes. I know you're busy
with Harvest.

28:34.815 --> 28:36.517
I thought maybe we could grab
a bite together?

28:36.550 --> 28:38.351
Oh, uh, well,
I would love to,

28:38.384 --> 28:40.821
but I'm going to
a Women in Business panel

28:40.854 --> 28:42.789
‐tonight in NOLA.
‐Well, I could go with you.

28:42.823 --> 28:44.357
No, it's not that big
of a deal.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.292
I'm barely going
to get there myself.

28:46.326 --> 28:47.528
What's going on?

28:47.561 --> 28:50.063
Well, my book
will be out soon.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.233
Oh! Why didn't you
say anything?

28:53.266 --> 28:55.435
I thought it was coming out
in a few months.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.971
‐Congratulations.
‐[laughs nervously]

28:58.004 --> 28:59.540
Oh...

28:59.573 --> 29:01.107
They moved
the publication date up.

29:01.141 --> 29:02.943
I'll be going on
a small tour soon.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.144
Maybe you could‐‐

29:04.177 --> 29:05.779
Yes, yes.
Soon as harvest is over,

29:05.812 --> 29:08.314
I will help you
with whatever you need.

29:08.348 --> 29:09.850
Okay, great. Thank you.

29:09.883 --> 29:12.218
But before you come over,

29:12.252 --> 29:14.454
I wanted you
to have this, please.

29:14.487 --> 29:16.089
Read it.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.525
Yeah, of course.
Can't wait.

29:18.559 --> 29:21.294
I'm just nervous about the book
coming out and doing well,

29:21.327 --> 29:23.196
and being received well.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.831
[clears throat]

29:24.865 --> 29:26.567
[man] Miss Charley, I have
the Johnsons on the phone.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.535
I got to take this.
We'll talk soon?

29:28.569 --> 29:30.571
Yes. Absolutely.
We'll catch up.

29:30.604 --> 29:32.072
[Charley]
Yeah.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.874
Hi, Mr. Johnson.

29:45.886 --> 29:47.788
[sighs]

30:02.035 --> 30:04.170
[inaudible]

30:37.904 --> 30:38.872
[laughs]

30:38.905 --> 30:40.541
You want to paint

30:40.574 --> 30:42.876
and don't think you're going
to get no paint on you?

30:48.414 --> 30:50.216
‐[car door slams]
‐Auntie Nova!

30:50.250 --> 30:52.018
‐[Nova] Hey!
‐[Ralph Angel] Hey, big sis.

30:52.052 --> 30:53.620
[Nova laughs]

30:57.123 --> 30:59.993
Hey. That paint's
going to be nice.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.895
I got your message.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.630
But you didn't say
why you was coming.

31:03.664 --> 31:06.399
I can't just come see
my favorite baby brother?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.401
Your only baby brother,
actually.

31:10.003 --> 31:12.338
‐So, what brings you by?
‐[Nova] Well, nothing much.

31:12.372 --> 31:16.476
Just dropping this off
for you, for later.

31:16.510 --> 31:18.945
No rush.
It's my book.

31:18.979 --> 31:21.281
Hey, now,
you got it done.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.617
It comes out soon,
and I wanted you to have it.

31:23.650 --> 31:26.152
But I could just leave it
on your desk for later.

31:26.186 --> 31:27.621
That's cool.

31:27.654 --> 31:29.890
That's a big deal, Nova.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.626
Congrats.

31:32.659 --> 31:33.960
Thank you.

32:18.171 --> 32:20.507
[Blue]
Close your eyes!

32:22.042 --> 32:23.343
Close your eyes.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.645
[Ralph Angel]
All right.

32:28.515 --> 32:29.716
Okay, you can open them.

32:32.485 --> 32:33.620
Do you like it?

32:33.654 --> 32:35.589
No.

32:36.523 --> 32:38.224
I love it.

32:38.258 --> 32:40.026
It's one of Aunts Vi's pies.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.562
I'm proud of it.

32:42.696 --> 32:45.165
You should be
proud of it.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.134
‐You know what?
‐What?

32:48.168 --> 32:50.436
I want to show you something
I'm proud of too.

32:50.470 --> 32:53.173
Came in the mail for me
the other day.

32:54.575 --> 32:56.610
It's a letter
from the government

32:56.643 --> 32:58.579
saying your daddy
ain't on parole no more.

32:58.612 --> 32:59.780
What's "parole" mean?

32:59.813 --> 33:01.548
It's another one
of them "P" words

33:01.582 --> 33:03.449
we be talking about.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.719
Penal system. Parole.

33:05.752 --> 33:07.721
Prison. Police.

33:07.754 --> 33:10.524
When you had your big
"time‐out"?

33:10.557 --> 33:13.159
Because of some things
I did a long time ago.

33:13.193 --> 33:15.128
Yeah.

33:16.730 --> 33:18.799
You know how Mr. Jarvis
be checking on me sometimes?

33:18.832 --> 33:20.500
‐Yeah?
‐See if I'm doing good?

33:20.534 --> 33:22.268
‐Yeah?
‐That's parole.

33:22.302 --> 33:25.639
Out of prison, but you could
go back real quick.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.610
[sighs]

33:29.643 --> 33:32.112
This letter says
I'm done with all that.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.548
You passed the test?

33:35.782 --> 33:37.618
That's right.
I did good.

33:38.384 --> 33:39.753
Good job, Pop.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.623
Thanks, buddy.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.494
[woman]
As the first black woman

33:48.529 --> 33:51.431
to own a sugar mill
in Louisiana,

33:51.464 --> 33:54.835
she has had to blaze
her own path.

33:54.868 --> 33:58.839
It gives me great pleasure
to present Miss Charley Bordelon

33:58.872 --> 34:03.176
with our 2019 Groundbreaker
of the Year Award.

34:03.209 --> 34:07.447
Please, everyone,
give a big NOLA congratulations

34:07.480 --> 34:09.249
to Charley Bordelon.

34:09.282 --> 34:10.651
[applause]

34:18.291 --> 34:20.393
Thank you. Wow.

34:20.426 --> 34:21.795
[laughs]

34:21.828 --> 34:23.597
Thank you.

34:26.466 --> 34:28.535
Thank you for this honor.

34:29.803 --> 34:31.471
To begin with,

34:31.505 --> 34:35.509
I would say we as women,
we have to stick together.

34:35.542 --> 34:37.343
No matter what.

34:37.377 --> 34:39.646
[applause]

34:42.348 --> 34:43.750
Even when it's not easy,

34:43.784 --> 34:45.819
we have to show
each other grace

34:45.852 --> 34:47.621
‐and push‐‐
‐Excuse me?

34:47.654 --> 34:49.656
Excuse me.
Miss Bordelon‐West?

34:50.824 --> 34:53.493
Yes. And it's simply
Bordelon now.

34:53.527 --> 34:56.429
Apologies. I'm a reporter
with the New Orleans Daily News,

34:56.462 --> 34:59.132
‐and I have some questions‐‐
‐Well perhaps we can do
this at another time.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.568
Would you say you're generally
supportive of all women?

35:01.602 --> 35:03.303
Excuse me?

35:05.271 --> 35:06.873
Of course I am.

35:06.907 --> 35:09.876
I've read an advanced copy
of your sister's memoir,

35:09.910 --> 35:11.812
Blessing and Blood,
by Nova Bordelon.

35:11.845 --> 35:13.847
And in it, she reveals
some disturbing truths

35:13.880 --> 35:16.149
about your role during
and especially after

35:16.182 --> 35:18.719
your ex‐husband
Davis West's sex scandal.

35:18.752 --> 35:20.253
[audible gasps]

35:23.824 --> 35:25.692
[camera shutters click]

35:26.860 --> 35:28.494
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:28.529 --> 35:30.196
Okay, I'll be more specific.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.733
The book details
the threatening actions you took

35:32.766 --> 35:34.467
towards Melina Galoudian,

35:34.500 --> 35:36.803
the woman who accused Davis
of orchestrating her assault

35:36.837 --> 35:39.540
by several members
of the L. A. Gladiators.

35:39.573 --> 35:41.742
The book alleges
you made a payment

35:41.775 --> 35:44.144
of several million dollars
to keep her quiet.

35:45.879 --> 35:48.181
Anyone can allege anything.

35:48.214 --> 35:51.284
So now your only sister
is just "anyone"?

35:52.819 --> 35:55.756
Nova Bordelon calls you‐‐
And I quote‐‐

35:55.789 --> 35:58.525
"A tragic example
of the American woman's

35:58.559 --> 36:00.393
unwitting but still
complicit role

36:00.426 --> 36:04.698
in perpetuating gender
inequality and rape culture

36:04.731 --> 36:06.332
as the price of full
participation

36:06.366 --> 36:07.934
in patriarchal capitalism."

36:07.968 --> 36:11.404
Oh, my God.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.640
I have no comment about that.
Now, as I was saying‐‐

36:13.674 --> 36:16.943
Do you feel you mishandled
the Melina Galoudian incident?

36:31.457 --> 36:32.893
[cork pops]

37:03.624 --> 37:05.559
[cell phone ringing]

37:11.832 --> 37:12.999
[sighs]

37:21.041 --> 37:22.008
Charley?

37:22.042 --> 37:24.578
Rah.

37:24.611 --> 37:25.846
We need to talk.

37:27.581 --> 37:29.349
You all right?

37:30.416 --> 37:31.518
It's early.

37:31.552 --> 37:35.321
Yeah, yeah.
I've been up all night.

37:35.355 --> 37:37.891
Did Nova give you
her manuscript yet?

37:38.692 --> 37:40.527
Yeah, I got it.

37:40.561 --> 37:42.563
Why?

37:42.596 --> 37:44.531
Do not read it.

37:44.565 --> 37:46.600
Not yet.

37:46.633 --> 37:49.570
Let me talk to you about it
before you do.

37:49.603 --> 37:50.704
Okay?

37:50.737 --> 37:53.473
Promise me, Rah.

37:53.507 --> 37:55.408
Charley, I don't know.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.310
Promise me, Ralph Angel.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.347
All right,
I'm going to wait for you.

38:01.381 --> 38:03.416
I'm on my way.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.385
I'll be there soon.

38:08.522 --> 38:10.490
[answer machine] Please leave
a message after the tone.

38:10.524 --> 38:11.725
[beep]

38:11.758 --> 38:13.627
Hi, Olivia. It's Charley.

38:13.660 --> 38:15.495
Call me back
as soon as possible.

38:15.529 --> 38:16.863
It's urgent.

38:16.897 --> 38:18.665
I need you to draw up
some papers

38:18.699 --> 38:20.667
regarding my sister's memoir.

38:20.701 --> 38:23.069
An immediate
cease and desist.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.072
Just call me back, please.

38:26.106 --> 38:27.608

[Nova] America's curse
is its thin sense of freedom

38:59.139 --> 39:01.775
that demands we all
pretend to be free.

39:01.808 --> 39:04.511
We lie.
This is what we do.

39:04.545 --> 39:05.846
In Blessing and Blood,

39:05.879 --> 39:08.448
the lies I have lived
are laid bare.

39:08.481 --> 39:11.151
The lies and shame
that have shackled my family

39:11.184 --> 39:12.986
are dragged into
the light of truth,

39:13.019 --> 39:15.589
because what is real
can heal.

39:15.622 --> 39:18.625
We see this clearly
in the life of my Aunt Violet,

39:18.659 --> 39:21.562
a strong black woman
who lived much of her life

39:21.595 --> 39:23.830
as anything but that.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.985
Blessing and Blood is
a declaration of independence

39:45.018 --> 39:49.790
from the shame that binds us,
cripples us, suffocates us.

39:49.823 --> 39:52.058
I break my family's
inbred silence

39:52.092 --> 39:54.460
around our country's
naughty questions of ownership

39:54.494 --> 39:57.163
by asking the questions
we dare not speak.

39:57.197 --> 39:59.099
Does the existence
of my sister's bribes

39:59.132 --> 40:02.102
endorse traditional notions
of women as property?

40:02.135 --> 40:05.739
Does the circumstance of my
nephew's conception and birth

40:05.772 --> 40:08.642
make my brother Ralph Angel
less of a father?

40:08.675 --> 40:10.877
Less of a man?

40:10.911 --> 40:12.779
Does America's
sense of virility

40:12.813 --> 40:14.815
really know more
than that of my brothers?

40:14.848 --> 40:16.750
A 20‐something ego so fragile

40:16.783 --> 40:19.219
that we as a family have,
until now,

40:19.252 --> 40:21.788
maintained the lie
that his beloved child

40:21.822 --> 40:23.423
came from his loins?

40:48.782 --> 40:51.552
Daddy...

40:51.585 --> 40:56.590
I know you're having a great,
unending day up there.

40:57.958 --> 41:01.762
I pray it's full of sunshine,

41:01.795 --> 41:05.566
peace and joy
beyond all understanding.

41:07.834 --> 41:10.604
I'm afraid, Daddy.

41:12.172 --> 41:15.776
Everyone is not going
to understand what I'm doing.

41:18.044 --> 41:20.046
But I'm offering up my work,

41:20.080 --> 41:23.016
hoping it will help us to...

41:23.917 --> 41:25.952
see better.

41:28.855 --> 41:31.592
To be better.

41:34.895 --> 41:37.731
Because I grew up
with too many secrets.

41:38.765 --> 41:39.866
[sniffles]

41:39.900 --> 41:41.134
You did too.

41:43.136 --> 41:46.540
And it's time
we were all set as free

41:46.573 --> 41:49.643
as you wanted to be.

41:51.945 --> 41:53.880
So, please...

41:55.616 --> 41:56.850
give me the strength

41:56.883 --> 41:58.719
to see this through.

42:01.855 --> 42:04.157
[sobbing softly]
