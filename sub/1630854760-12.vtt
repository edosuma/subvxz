00:02.652 --> 00:05.129
(mysterious music)

00:24.433 --> 00:26.750
(Morgan): Luther, no candy
in class.

00:26.769 --> 00:27.768
(groaning)

00:28.254 --> 00:30.254
It's okay. I'll give it
back to you at pickup, okay?

00:30.256 --> 00:33.090
Alright, does anyone know what
today is?

00:33.108 --> 00:34.424
Fast facts!

00:34.443 --> 00:36.518
(children whining)
Yes, that's right!

00:36.595 --> 00:38.853
You got five minutes
to answer these questions.

00:38.931 --> 00:41.281
Don't worry if you don't know
an answer, just keep going.

00:41.433 --> 00:42.624
Okay?

00:49.533 --> 00:50.466
(sighing)

01:01.896 --> 01:04.879
(coughing)

01:04.957 --> 01:08.067
(choking)

01:09.128 --> 01:11.028
- Uh, Mrs. Knight?

01:12.631 --> 01:14.965
(Luther choking)

01:14.967 --> 01:18.035
- Luther? Luther!

01:19.396 --> 01:21.805
Luther! Luther!
(classmate): Luther is choking!

01:22.491 --> 01:23.582
- Marcus! Marcus,
go get the nurse!

01:23.733 --> 01:25.567
You have my permission
to run in the hall!

01:25.644 --> 01:27.902
(intense music)

01:28.497 --> 01:30.238
<i> (operator): 911.</i>
- Pembroke Elementary School,

01:30.316 --> 01:32.240
1st Avenue!
My student's choking!

01:32.318 --> 01:33.592
- It's okay. I got him.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.514
(laboured breaths)

01:41.493 --> 01:42.542
Nice job.
- It's okay.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.103
- There you are.
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:44.179 --> 01:45.437
- How you doing, bud?

01:47.257 --> 01:48.515
What's your name?

01:48.592 --> 01:49.516
- Luther Jennins.

01:49.593 --> 01:50.592
- Alright, Luther.

01:50.719 --> 01:51.426
The nurse here is gonna

01:51.445 --> 01:52.336
take care of you, alright?

01:52.338 --> 01:54.029
- Look, I'll get your stuff.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.698
- Okay. Come on.

01:58.694 --> 02:01.361
(panting)
- Thank you so much.

02:01.438 --> 02:03.580
- Of course.
I'm Kashir.

02:04.183 --> 02:04.957
I'm covering 4B.

02:05.108 --> 02:06.441
- Morgan Knight.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.543
- Hey.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.174
(sighing)

02:19.698 --> 02:22.516
(children playing)

02:23.960 --> 02:24.560
(Kashir): Morgan?

02:25.629 --> 02:27.128
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle you.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.480
- No, no. Sorry.
(chuckling)

02:28.632 --> 02:29.631
I'm just... I'm fine.

02:29.725 --> 02:31.892
Just a bit jumpy still.

02:31.968 --> 02:33.377
- This ride you?

02:33.395 --> 02:34.653
- Uh...

02:35.489 --> 02:37.489
In the sense that
it belongs to me, yes.

02:37.641 --> 02:41.568
In the sense that it speaks
to my identity?

02:41.645 --> 02:43.069
No, no. It was...

02:43.146 --> 02:44.388
I didn't pick it out.

02:44.406 --> 02:46.165
It was a gift.
From my husband.

02:46.241 --> 02:47.574
I like the colour, though.

02:48.151 --> 02:49.835
- Big Lakers fan?
- No.

02:49.986 --> 02:50.836
No.

02:50.987 --> 02:51.912
Just statistically,

02:52.064 --> 02:53.839
yellow cars kill fewer people.

02:54.066 --> 02:54.822
- That's good to know.

02:54.842 --> 02:55.674
- Yeah.

02:56.752 --> 02:59.094
Listen, I'll be covering
for a few weeks, so uh...

02:59.996 --> 03:01.071
see you around.

03:01.073 --> 03:02.923
- Okay. Yeah. Get home safe.

03:02.999 --> 03:04.224
- Thanks, Ms. Knight.

03:04.927 --> 03:06.226
(chuckling)

03:08.472 --> 03:11.481
(calm music)

03:13.101 --> 03:15.027
- Oh. What? Really?

03:15.178 --> 03:17.154
(cellphone vibrating)

03:19.107 --> 03:20.365
- Yeah, what's up?

03:20.517 --> 03:21.516
<i> - Hi, um,</i>

03:21.610 --> 03:23.093
I need you to pick up
Ari from school.

03:23.186 --> 03:24.519
I'm not gonna make it
there on time.

03:24.596 --> 03:27.264
- Why not?
- I have a flat tire.

03:27.282 --> 03:29.115
<i> - Well, how'd that happen? </i>

03:29.192 --> 03:30.450
- I, I have no idea.

03:30.602 --> 03:32.602
Does it matter? Someone needs
to pick up our son.

03:32.604 --> 03:34.271
- Babe, have Inez do it.

03:34.273 --> 03:35.772
<i> That's why I pay her.</i>

03:35.791 --> 03:37.031
- Well, she's off today.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.277
And Julie's kid is home
sick, so no one can do it.

03:40.295 --> 03:42.295
- Including me. I'm at work.

03:42.372 --> 03:45.039
- Okay. I really don't want Ari
just waiting for us.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.466
Um, can you have Orelia do it?

03:46.543 --> 03:48.376
<i> I'll meet her at home</i>
<i> as soon as I can.</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:49.135
- Orelia!

03:49.212 --> 03:50.646
- Okay. Thank you.

03:51.548 --> 03:54.358
And-- uh...

03:57.071 --> 03:58.462
- Hey, come in.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.963
- I thought I told you
to dump Geyser.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.055
- It's gonna move.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.908
- You're flying too close
to the sun.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.318
- I'm just trying not to work
for you forever, Ron.

04:05.395 --> 04:06.894
If this goes the way I think
it's gonna go,

04:06.972 --> 04:08.730
you're not gonna be working
for me at all.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.823
- I'm holding.

04:09.975 --> 04:11.416
- Your funeral.

04:13.963 --> 04:17.506
(ominous music)

04:22.321 --> 04:23.987
- You know I wouldn't miss
your recital

04:23.989 --> 04:25.155
if I didn't have to, right?

04:25.157 --> 04:26.080
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.674
- Daddy's gonna be there

04:27.826 --> 04:29.826
and he's gonna film it for me
so I can watch it.

04:29.845 --> 04:32.178
And watch it, and watch it,
and watch it, and watch it

04:32.331 --> 04:33.421
until I can play the cello.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.681
- You can't play the cello.

04:34.775 --> 04:40.070
- Well, I can't play it
right now, but just wait.

04:41.023 --> 04:43.031
I'll be able to play it.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.077
Good night.
- Good night.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.778
(door closing)

04:57.614 --> 04:59.447
(Jason): Yeah, whatever
we've got on Geyser.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.525
I want the latest, in my inbox.

05:01.527 --> 05:04.219
And track it in real time,
okay?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.473
(sighing)

05:08.700 --> 05:10.534
What is this suitcase for?

05:10.552 --> 05:13.729
- Uh, Boston, tomorrow,
the conference.

05:14.556 --> 05:15.731
It's in your calendar.

05:16.966 --> 05:18.984
- Oh, that. Okay.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.490
Um, which means you gotta take
Ari to his cello recital.

05:25.642 --> 05:26.641
- Oh. Oh, no...

05:26.902 --> 05:29.069
Tomorrow's crazy.
Maybe you can move your thing.

05:29.145 --> 05:32.039
- They're not gonna reschedule
the conference for me.

05:32.741 --> 05:34.148
Jason, it's my career.

05:34.317 --> 05:37.561
- Well, based on what they pay
you, it's more like a hobby.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.263
- I think Ari would
really like it

05:40.265 --> 05:41.340
if you took him to the recital.

05:41.491 --> 05:43.592
I mean, you haven't even
heard him play.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.427
(sighing)

05:50.409 --> 05:51.999
(Kashir): She just had a baby,
so it might be a while.

05:52.077 --> 05:55.145
I might be here for
a few months. Oh, excuse me.
One second.

05:55.672 --> 05:56.671
Road trip?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.416
- Um, educational seminar
in Boston.

05:59.434 --> 06:01.418
- The Zahman thing?
- You know Zahman?

06:01.436 --> 06:03.086
- Yeah, he was
my thesis advisor.

06:03.088 --> 06:05.179
- I worked on his inquiry-based
learning initiative.

06:05.273 --> 06:06.590
(chuckling)
Tell him I said hi.

06:07.183 --> 06:08.516
- Okay.
- You driving there?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.535
- No, I'm taking the train
from Penn Station.

06:10.687 --> 06:13.372
- I'll give you a lift.
- I don't think I can fit
on your handlebars.

06:13.523 --> 06:15.189
(chuckling)
- I brought my car today.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.117
- It's not a Lotus or anything,

06:17.193 --> 06:19.769
but dragging luggage
on the subway sucks. Come on.

06:19.771 --> 06:22.105
- Are you sure?
- The question is: are you sure

06:22.107 --> 06:23.590
you can handle my Camry?

06:24.367 --> 06:25.050
(chuckling)

06:25.085 --> 06:27.094
(car honking)

06:30.298 --> 06:33.541
- Well, uh, thank you
so much for the ride.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.394
I'm gonna go, uh, drink
at the bar

06:35.470 --> 06:39.046
because, uh, that's the rule
about travel days, I think.

06:39.124 --> 06:40.273
- You want company?

06:41.735 --> 06:44.552
I'm not travelling, but I did
find a legal parking spot

06:44.630 --> 06:47.572
in Manhattan and if that isn't
worth celebrating...

06:49.801 --> 06:54.154
- Um, I think getting a drink
with a colleague sounds great,

06:54.915 --> 06:58.158
but I just, I gotta be clear,
um, that that's all it is

06:58.310 --> 07:00.210
because I'm married.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.314
- May I?

07:04.316 --> 07:05.465
- Sure.

07:09.821 --> 07:10.912
(sighing)

07:11.173 --> 07:12.431
(car honking)

07:16.920 --> 07:19.162
- Sorry I'm late.
I've got him, Inez.

07:19.181 --> 07:20.680
Alright.
Let's go. Let's go.

07:20.757 --> 07:22.757
(doorman): There's saying 10
people so far, but you know...

07:22.776 --> 07:25.168
(tenant): I went to Boston
last week on that same train.

07:25.187 --> 07:27.595
It's awful.
- Are we talking about
the Boston train?

07:27.614 --> 07:28.429
What happened?

07:28.449 --> 07:29.614
- Yeah, here. Check it out.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.508
<i> (reporter): Police</i>
<i> and ambulances are still</i>

07:31.526 --> 07:33.768
<i> on the scene</i>

07:47.359 --> 07:49.542
Hey, Ari, I need you
to stand over here.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.969
I've got to make a phone call.

07:51.162 --> 07:53.305
- But we're already late!
- Ari! Ari.

07:53.381 --> 07:55.807
Listen to me.
I need you to stand right here.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.602
Here. Right here. Do not move.

08:01.373 --> 08:02.222
Stay right there.

08:02.799 --> 08:05.225
(Eric): We busted that Colombian
dude you told me about,

08:05.377 --> 08:07.043
he had three girls locked up.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.562
- You wanna give me another,
go ahead, but you know...

08:09.639 --> 08:12.699
- Hey, you're doing
good work, Flaco.

08:13.476 --> 08:14.976
(phone vibrating)

08:14.995 --> 08:16.569
- Who's that?

08:16.646 --> 08:17.478
- It's my brother.

08:17.647 --> 08:19.480
- I didn't know you had
a brother.

08:20.058 --> 08:21.148
- I gotta take this.

08:21.576 --> 08:22.984
Come on, get out, Flaco.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.628
- Alright.

08:25.897 --> 08:28.465
(dog barking)
(train passing)

08:29.584 --> 08:32.660
- Jase?
- Morgan is on the Boston train.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.494
- The crash?

08:33.588 --> 08:35.847
- Yes, and she's not answering

08:35.924 --> 08:37.641
her phone, and...

08:39.019 --> 08:40.910
And they keep talking about
people being dead.

08:40.929 --> 08:44.414
I keep calling this emergency
number but I can't get through
to anyone.

08:44.416 --> 08:47.174
- Okay, I'll make some calls.
(sniffling)

08:47.194 --> 08:48.768
Where are you?
- Home.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.363
- Okay, I'll be right there.
Are you still on 54th?

08:52.557 --> 08:55.242
- East 72nd.
I'll text you the address.

08:57.445 --> 09:00.354
Hey, buddy, we're gonna have
to skip this recital.

09:00.432 --> 09:02.749
We will talk about it upstairs.
Come on.

(exhaling)

09:10.776 --> 09:11.633
(sighing)

09:13.128 --> 09:14.702

I missed my train.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.554
(chuckling)

09:15.705 --> 09:17.038
- Who hasn't missed a train?

09:17.132 --> 09:18.390
- Me.
(chuckling)

09:18.466 --> 09:21.101
- I've never missed
a train in my entire life.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.688
I've never done anything
like this.

09:26.641 --> 09:28.441
- How's it going for you so far?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.217

09:30.295 --> 09:31.519

09:32.147 --> 09:33.738
- Um, sorry. I just...

09:33.815 --> 09:36.992
My husband keeps calling and
I'm just worried it's my kid.

09:41.973 --> 09:43.206

09:44.976 --> 09:46.643
Hi, um, can I call you back?

09:49.331 --> 09:50.755

- Weren't you on the 5:40 train
to Boston?

09:54.035 --> 09:56.077

10:20.512 --> 10:22.528
- Hey.
- Hey, did you find anything?

10:23.031 --> 10:24.289
- I talked to my buddy
in transport.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.458
None of the casualties match
Morgan's description.

10:26.609 --> 10:28.960
- Well, then, why
haven't I heard from her?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.463
- Hey, Ari.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.633
- Who are you?
- What do you mean,
"who are you?"

10:34.709 --> 10:36.968
This is your uncle Eric,
you know that. Give him a hug.

10:37.045 --> 10:38.136
- Hey, it's cool, Ari.
It's cool.

10:38.363 --> 10:39.954
How about a fist bump
instead? Yeah?

10:40.031 --> 10:41.381
I'm practically a stranger.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.624
Who wants to hug
a stranger, right?

10:43.702 --> 10:45.218
- Right. It's weird.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.604
- Yeah.
- Alright, give us some privacy.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.555
(sighing)

10:49.724 --> 10:52.299
(emergency sirens blaring
outside)

10:52.319 --> 10:54.135
He know anything?
- No.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.546
Can't you trace her phone
or something?

10:56.548 --> 10:58.548
- Hey, anybody that knows
anything is looking out for her,

10:58.566 --> 11:00.049
so take a breath, okay?

11:00.068 --> 11:01.201
(door closing)

11:05.557 --> 11:06.556
(sighing)

11:06.558 --> 11:08.315
- Um, yeah.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.576
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I know you were worried.

11:11.062 --> 11:12.412
Thanks for being here, Eric.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.580
- You...
I left you 12 messages.

11:14.733 --> 11:18.009
You couldn't answer your phone?
You couldn't call me?

11:19.162 --> 11:20.828
(clearing throat)
- Is Ari in his room?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.663
- Yeah. Now tell me why
you didn't answer the phone.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.665
- I'm gonna go tuck him in
and then, we'll talk.

11:24.743 --> 11:25.850
No, no. You're gonna stay
right here

11:26.002 --> 11:26.851
and tell me why the hell

11:26.928 --> 11:27.852
you didn't answer my calls.

11:27.929 --> 11:29.170
(Eric, chuckling): Hey, hey.

11:29.247 --> 11:30.671
I'm really glad you're okay,
Morgan.

11:30.749 --> 11:33.917
And at least I finally got
to see this beautiful apartment.

11:33.935 --> 11:35.585
It's really nice by the way.

11:35.587 --> 11:36.936
- Give Regina my love.

11:37.088 --> 11:38.196
- I will.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.258
(door opening, closing)

11:42.277 --> 11:44.411
- So, what the hell is going on?

11:49.117 --> 11:50.625
- I want a divorce.

11:51.937 --> 11:52.752
(scoffing)

11:54.606 --> 11:56.005
- Excuse me?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.049
(sighing)

11:58.159 --> 12:00.635
- I said I want a divorce.

12:04.282 --> 12:06.099
- So you were with someone
else tonight.

12:07.452 --> 12:09.135
Hmm? No, you didn't miss
the train,

12:09.287 --> 12:10.544
you were sleeping
with someone else tonight.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.523
- I was with someone else.
We didn't sleep together.

12:15.068 --> 12:15.975
- Who is he?

12:17.353 --> 12:19.220
- That doesn't matter,
that's not what this is about.

12:19.297 --> 12:22.131
- Oh, well then, what is this
about? Some kind of revenge?

12:22.150 --> 12:23.057
'Cause you said you forgave me.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.909
- I did. I forgave you.

12:25.061 --> 12:26.536
I forgave you.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.154
I tried!

12:28.231 --> 12:29.822
- Oh.
- Jason, you...

12:29.975 --> 12:31.157
this is not a life.

12:31.234 --> 12:32.475
(scoffing)
It's not!

12:32.494 --> 12:34.660
Look, you don't even listen
to me when I talk.

12:34.737 --> 12:37.255
You don't care about what
I think or what I feel.

12:37.332 --> 12:39.406
Half the time I'm trying
to trick you into spending time

12:39.426 --> 12:41.317
with Ari and I,
and that doesn't even work!

12:41.336 --> 12:44.411
- I have given you everything.
- You haven't!

12:44.431 --> 12:47.248
You haven't given me everything
and that's what I'm saying!

12:47.267 --> 12:49.659
- You had nothing when
you met me! Nothing!

12:49.677 --> 12:53.496
And I have worked my ass off
to get us into Manhattan,

12:53.515 --> 12:56.590
to buy this apartment,
to pay for Ari's private school!

12:56.668 --> 12:58.534
- I didn't want that!
That's you!

12:58.536 --> 13:00.945
That's all the stuff
you have to prove!

13:01.097 --> 13:02.263
- Who is he?

13:02.524 --> 13:03.114
- It doesn't matter.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.431
(screaming): Who is he?!

13:04.526 --> 13:07.160
- I'm not doing this
with you right now. Stop!

13:08.013 --> 13:10.038
(seething)

13:11.349 --> 13:13.500
- You are not taking my kid.

13:15.854 --> 13:16.869
- When you heard about the crash

13:16.946 --> 13:19.488
and you thought
that I might be dead,

13:20.208 --> 13:21.615
what did you really think about?

13:21.693 --> 13:24.093
Did you think about being
a single dad?

13:25.713 --> 13:27.788
About you being alone with Ari?

13:27.866 --> 13:31.017
(ominous music)

13:36.465 --> 13:39.067
I'm gonna sleep
in the guest room tonight.

13:44.399 --> 13:45.806
(door creaking)

13:45.884 --> 13:46.741
(door closing)

13:48.386 --> 13:49.452
(sighing)

13:50.997 --> 13:52.997
(piano music)

13:53.074 --> 13:54.332
(Judge Cabrera): Ms. Knight,

13:54.483 --> 13:56.075
the U.S District Attorney has
charged you

13:56.152 --> 13:57.651
with a class A-1 Felony.

13:57.729 --> 14:00.821
It carries a penalty of up to
20 years in federal prison.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.623
Do you understand
these charges?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.509
- Yes, Your Honour.

14:04.586 --> 14:06.427
- And how do you plead?

14:07.830 --> 14:09.013
- Not guilty.

14:09.090 --> 14:12.600
(theme song)

14:25.532 --> 14:27.490
(school bell ringing)

14:28.927 --> 14:30.493
- Yep!
- Hi.

14:31.395 --> 14:33.354
Can I um...?
- Yeah.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.266
I was gonna call you last night
to see how you were doing,
but...

14:37.360 --> 14:39.544
- Yeah. Not calling was
the right call.

14:40.271 --> 14:42.105
- So, how are you?

14:42.198 --> 14:44.674
- Um, I'm fine.

14:45.701 --> 14:46.959
Yeah, I'm better
than fine.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.202
- What'd you tell your husband?

14:48.279 --> 14:50.054
- I asked for a divorce.

14:50.782 --> 14:51.614
Not because of you.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.707
I mean, you were a catalyst,
I guess,

14:53.727 --> 14:57.954
but my marriage had been over
for a long time.

14:58.881 --> 15:03.126
And I've been holding on
for some misguided reasons,

15:03.128 --> 15:06.220
and you, you...

15:06.239 --> 15:09.908
you really helped me finally
let go.

15:09.984 --> 15:11.910
So, thank you.

15:12.061 --> 15:12.985
- Yeah, yeah.

15:13.729 --> 15:16.489
If what happened was me helping
you somehow, then...

15:16.975 --> 15:17.731
(chuckling)

15:18.251 --> 15:20.209
I'm happy to help.
(chuckling)

15:22.905 --> 15:24.480
- I just wanted you
to know that.

15:24.482 --> 15:25.506
- Okay.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.974
(ominous music)

15:35.994 --> 15:37.101
(sighing)

15:39.497 --> 15:42.774
- Jason. You didn't listen
to me on Geyser.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.593
- Yeah, and I made your firm
$36 million.

15:46.671 --> 15:49.405
- A million of which is sitting
on your desk right now.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.699
In your new office.

15:54.437 --> 15:56.529
Did you hear what I said?
You're a partner.

15:56.681 --> 15:59.123
It's what you've been gunning
for since the day I hired you.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.867
- Yeah, no, yeah, definitely.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.703
- Well, then come on!
Let's celebrate!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.631
Let's spend some of
that money you made us.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.424
Come on!

16:11.196 --> 16:12.953
We both grew up
in Staten Island,

16:13.456 --> 16:15.640
went to the same high school.
Not at the same time.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.624
Though I hadn't even graduated

16:17.702 --> 16:19.626
and he was already crushing it
on Wall Street.

16:19.704 --> 16:21.929
- Well, how did you meet?
- At a bar.

16:21.964 --> 16:23.039
I was 22.

16:23.299 --> 16:25.041
He told me that night
he was going to marry me.

16:25.710 --> 16:29.970
Of course, I didn't believe him,
um, but he meant it.

16:30.715 --> 16:33.899
That's where I learned that
Jason gets what he wants.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.493
- Did you want him?

16:36.312 --> 16:37.203
- Yeah.

16:38.723 --> 16:40.814
Yeah. For a while anyway...

16:40.834 --> 16:42.125
- And what changed that?

16:43.152 --> 16:44.002
- Money.

16:44.229 --> 16:46.487
Um, Jason's dad died
when he was 10

16:46.539 --> 16:49.323
and his mom really struggled
to raise him and his brother,

16:49.400 --> 16:52.093
and that was not gonna happen
to Jason.

16:53.071 --> 16:54.512
But uh, the more money
he made,

16:54.589 --> 16:59.091
the more he wanted
and he became just...

16:59.168 --> 17:00.184
unrecognizable.

17:00.336 --> 17:02.245
- Was he aware that
you felt this way?

17:02.247 --> 17:04.505
- I didn't grow up
with money either,

17:05.174 --> 17:08.267
so it was nice to have things.

17:08.344 --> 17:12.255
And... and it made
Jason feel good, you know,

17:12.273 --> 17:14.257
that he had a wife
that didn't have to work.

17:14.259 --> 17:15.941
- But you went back
to work anyway.

17:16.594 --> 17:19.612
- Yeah. I mean, by then,
we were living adjacent lives,

17:19.764 --> 17:22.356
and I just felt... stuck.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.500
- Well, let's get you unstuck.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.757
(soft music)

17:36.038 --> 17:36.946
(door opening)

17:36.964 --> 17:40.224
(sinister music)

17:44.289 --> 17:45.730
(door slamming)
(gasping)

17:47.716 --> 17:52.219
- Do you know what I was doing
while you were cheating on me?

17:52.647 --> 17:54.197
- Jason, go to bed.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.098
(chuckling)

17:56.801 --> 17:58.659
- I made another million.

18:00.972 --> 18:02.805
Now, you know that uh...

18:03.416 --> 18:05.399
- Jason.
- ...place in the woods
that you liked?

18:05.476 --> 18:07.418
- Jason. Come on.
Go to bed. Go to bed.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.903
- Listen, it's yours,
it's yours, it's yours,

18:09.981 --> 18:12.148
it's yours. It's all yours.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.668
All you gotta do is ask me
for forgiveness.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.003
- Get off me!
- Hey, hey, hey.

18:18.156 --> 18:19.672
This is my apartment!

18:19.766 --> 18:22.249
I bought it
and everything in it.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.436
I bought this bed.
And if I wanna sleep in it,
with my wife...

18:25.513 --> 18:27.997
- No! Get off!

18:27.999 --> 18:30.182
(grunting)

18:30.335 --> 18:33.111
Get off! Get off me!

18:33.947 --> 18:36.447
(Ari): What are you two doing?

18:36.932 --> 18:37.931
(gasping)

18:38.009 --> 18:39.600
- Hey. Hey, baby.

18:39.619 --> 18:43.287
I'm sorry. Go to bed,
okay? I'm coming.

18:43.439 --> 18:44.497
I'm coming.

18:46.684 --> 18:49.627
(whispering): Get out!
Get out of this house now!

18:49.778 --> 18:51.963
(normal voice):
You're never touching me again!

18:52.114 --> 18:52.964
(screaming):
Ever!

18:53.115 --> 18:54.281
And if you don't want your son

18:54.300 --> 18:55.374
to see you dragged outta here

18:55.526 --> 18:59.011
in handcuffs, get out! Leave!

19:00.473 --> 19:04.142
(panicked breathing)

19:27.834 --> 19:30.817
(mediator): I'm pleased both
parties have come to
a mutual agreement.

19:31.487 --> 19:34.672
Starting with childcare, Morgan
will receive full custody.

19:34.749 --> 19:37.508
Jason will retain a reasonable
visitation schedule,

19:37.660 --> 19:38.751
every other weekend.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.053
- That's not gonna work
for me anymore.

19:41.589 --> 19:43.014
I want custody.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.266
- Are you serious?

19:45.834 --> 19:46.500
- Full custody.

19:46.627 --> 19:48.186
(Morgan): Jason, we agreed.

19:48.337 --> 19:50.746
It's taken us two months
to get to this point.

19:50.765 --> 19:52.473
You can't just change your mind.

19:53.584 --> 19:56.194
- Uh, give me a moment
with my client?

19:59.032 --> 20:01.866
Help me understand,
what's changed?

20:02.017 --> 20:04.869
She's introducing my kid
to the guy she's been banging.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.263
Didn't have the decency
to tell me herself,

20:07.265 --> 20:08.781
I had to find out from Ari.

20:08.933 --> 20:09.782
- Jason.
- No.

20:09.934 --> 20:10.933
There is no way

20:11.044 --> 20:12.618
that this son of a bitch is
raising my kid.

20:12.770 --> 20:17.273
- You'll have him
every other weekend.
- I want full custody.

20:17.275 --> 20:18.382
- You work 70 hours a week.

20:18.609 --> 20:20.960
- I'll get help.
Whatever I need I can afford.

20:21.112 --> 20:23.704
- I doubt that argument will
persuade the judge.

20:23.798 --> 20:24.889
You won't win.

20:24.966 --> 20:26.724
- Do I need another lawyer?

20:33.458 --> 20:36.400
(ominous music)

20:38.463 --> 20:39.654
(sighing)

20:42.817 --> 20:44.492
- Why are you doing this?

20:47.472 --> 20:48.412
- Because I can.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.639
- What does that even mean?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.376
- It means I always get
what I want.

20:53.902 --> 20:54.752
Always have.

20:55.070 --> 20:56.545
You should know that
better than anyone.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.095
- You don't know him.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.265
You don't know what
he's capable of

21:07.416 --> 21:08.491
when he doesn't get
what he wants.

21:08.493 --> 21:11.060
- No judge is gonna take
Ari from you.

21:12.755 --> 21:13.679
(sighing)

21:13.831 --> 21:15.564
- I just want it to be over.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.834
You know, when I'm not
in a custody battle

21:18.853 --> 21:21.670
with my ex-husband,
I'm actually a very fun person.

21:21.689 --> 21:22.671
- Yeah.
(chuckling)

21:22.690 --> 21:23.930
You day drink when you travel.

21:24.008 --> 21:24.840
You're wild.

21:24.859 --> 21:26.175
- I know. I'm crazy.

21:26.193 --> 21:28.286
(Kashir laughing)

21:28.362 --> 21:30.846
- Look, I know this got
serious really fast,

21:31.474 --> 21:32.456
but I'm not going anywhere.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.201
So if you need to take a beat
before I meet Ari, I get it.

21:36.354 --> 21:38.462
- Mm-mm.
I want you to meet him.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.523
'Cause I know
he's gonna love you.

21:41.375 --> 21:44.635
And I also want him to see
his mother in a happy

21:44.862 --> 21:45.786
and functional relationship.

21:45.788 --> 21:47.379
- Oh, that's nice.
I'm a bandaid.

21:47.532 --> 21:50.808
- As a homewrecker,
I think it's the very least
you could do.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.143
- Oh, okay.

21:52.294 --> 21:54.812
What got you?
My dazzling smile?

21:54.889 --> 21:56.889
- Mm-hmm.
- A homewrecker?
- Mm-hmm.

21:56.965 --> 21:57.964
- 'Cause I'm so hot, right?

21:57.984 --> 21:58.724
- Yeah.

21:58.801 --> 21:59.542
(giggling)

21:59.710 --> 22:00.985
- Call me a homewrecker again.

22:01.062 --> 22:02.044
(softly): Homewrecker.

22:02.063 --> 22:04.655
(laughing)

22:04.732 --> 22:06.306
- We lost the motion.
I can file an appeal,

22:06.384 --> 22:07.566
but I doubt
it'll make a difference.

22:07.643 --> 22:10.161
You should seriously
consider letting this go.

22:11.146 --> 22:12.705
- Why would I let it go?

22:16.260 --> 22:18.127
(doorbell chiming)

22:21.841 --> 22:25.092
(soft music)

22:28.239 --> 22:29.347
(Morgan gasping)
(Kashir): Hi.

22:29.498 --> 22:30.765
(Morgan): Hi.

22:33.094 --> 22:35.094
Ari, this is Kashir.

22:35.246 --> 22:37.746
Kashir, this is my son,
Ari.

22:37.765 --> 22:39.172
- Ari! It's nice to meet you.

22:39.266 --> 22:41.750
Here, these are for you.

22:42.436 --> 22:46.088
And these are for your mom.
- Aw, thank you.

22:46.107 --> 22:47.940
- Why are you giving me flowers?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.367
- Who doesn't like flowers?

22:50.519 --> 22:53.854
Fine! Your mom gets all
the flowers. How about that?

22:53.948 --> 22:54.780
- Okay.

22:54.932 --> 22:55.873
- That's so nice.

22:56.434 --> 22:58.859
Ari, Kashir is a teacher
at my school.

22:58.936 --> 23:00.694
- But what she doesn't know is,
my other job is playing
Fortnite.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.131
- That's not a job.
- Okay. It's more like
a passion.

23:06.460 --> 23:09.202
- Okay. Alright, fine.
Two rounds.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.295
Then, we go for dinner.

23:10.372 --> 23:12.798
- Yes!
(Kashir laughing)

23:12.875 --> 23:16.227
(bright music)

23:19.473 --> 23:20.881
- You know what I never
understood?

23:21.459 --> 23:22.883
Why they call it spare ribs?

23:23.310 --> 23:25.628
- Maybe they're like
spare tires.

23:25.646 --> 23:27.220
In case the real ones break.

23:27.298 --> 23:29.965
- That is a great answer, Ari.

23:30.468 --> 23:32.410
- You're very smart.
- Seriously.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.471
- Can I go look at the cat?

23:35.489 --> 23:36.664
- Sure.

23:39.085 --> 23:39.917
Thanks for taking us here.

23:40.068 --> 23:41.143
This is the exact kind of place

23:41.162 --> 23:42.978
that Jason would never be
caught dead in.

23:42.997 --> 23:44.547
(laughing)

23:46.074 --> 23:47.133
- Cool kid.

23:48.169 --> 23:49.985
- Why are you doing this?

23:49.987 --> 23:51.095
- Whoa.

23:51.672 --> 23:52.579
Whoa, what?

23:52.765 --> 23:56.249
- It's just me and Ari
and a crazy ex.

23:56.343 --> 23:57.918
It's a... it's a lot of baggage.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.937
- And you're selling
that sweet apartment.

24:00.088 --> 24:01.922
Damn, why am I even here?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.732
- I'm serious.

24:05.002 --> 24:06.527
- I like you, Morgan.

24:07.429 --> 24:08.487
Like a lot.

24:09.765 --> 24:10.597
None of this feels like baggage.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.108
It feels like two adults
figuring it out.

24:13.435 --> 24:14.026
- Okay.

24:14.436 --> 24:16.620
- That's all I get?
"Okay."

24:17.606 --> 24:19.415
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:20.017 --> 24:20.849
- Okay.

24:20.851 --> 24:22.534
I like you a lot.

24:23.037 --> 24:24.462
- I like you a lot too.

24:28.876 --> 24:31.010
(outgoing call)

24:33.197 --> 24:35.139
<i> (Eric): Jason? What's up?</i>

24:36.033 --> 24:37.049
- Are you home?

24:37.201 --> 24:38.884
(Regina): What did he say
he wants?

24:38.961 --> 24:39.868
- He didn't.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.221
What makes you think
he wants something?

24:42.373 --> 24:44.540
- Because that's
the only time he calls.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.442
Like the train crash.

24:48.136 --> 24:50.654
- Come on, Regina,
he's my brother.

24:50.731 --> 24:53.398
He hasn't been your brother
since he moved away.

24:53.809 --> 24:55.159
(doorbell chiming)

24:56.311 --> 24:58.144
- Can't you at least come
and say hello?

24:58.498 --> 25:00.080
- I'd rather not.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.376
I'm sorry.

25:05.505 --> 25:06.962
(doorbell chiming)

25:08.232 --> 25:10.132
Be careful, okay?

25:13.996 --> 25:16.096
(doorbell chiming repeatedly)

25:17.666 --> 25:18.849
- Hey, Jase.
- Hey.

25:18.926 --> 25:19.975
- Come in, man.

25:22.596 --> 25:23.687
- Where's Regina?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.190
- Upstairs. She uh, wanted
to say hello,

25:26.341 --> 25:28.192
but she got one
of her migraines.

25:29.103 --> 25:30.010
(sighing)

25:30.512 --> 25:33.772
Just uh, watch your step
here, it's a tricky step.

25:33.924 --> 25:35.741
(insects chirping)

25:37.870 --> 25:39.278
Sit there if you want.

25:39.430 --> 25:40.496
- Sure.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.414
- Here.

25:43.434 --> 25:44.500
(grunting)

25:48.381 --> 25:49.463
Cheers.

25:50.441 --> 25:51.465
- Cheers.

25:57.581 --> 25:58.556
- So, what's up?

25:58.966 --> 26:00.975
- Morgan's divorcing me.

26:01.543 --> 26:02.634
- Yeah, I heard.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.286
She called Regina.

26:04.713 --> 26:06.730
I was wondering when you were
gonna tell me, though.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.474
- Look, I should've called you,
but I've been kind of a mess.

26:09.627 --> 26:12.644
- Look, I'm probably not
in a position to say this.

26:12.797 --> 26:15.055
You know, it's been a while
since I've seen you and Morgan,

26:15.132 --> 26:16.315
but maybe it's a good thing.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.909
- She's taking Ari from me.
She's ruining my life.

26:19.061 --> 26:20.560
- You'll get visitation,
though, right?

26:20.580 --> 26:25.231
So, maybe you... you start there
and then you see what happens.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.067
- I haven't been perfect.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.419
She's been pissed at me before,

26:28.495 --> 26:31.647
but she never would've
broken up our family.

26:31.665 --> 26:34.666
No. Not until this, this,
this guy from work

26:34.743 --> 26:36.985
that she's banging,
it's all his fault.

26:36.987 --> 26:38.053
- That's rough.

26:38.505 --> 26:39.655
I'm sorry.

26:40.082 --> 26:41.599
- I gotta do something.

26:43.661 --> 26:44.660
- What can you do?

26:45.253 --> 26:48.439
- I was hoping you knew someone
that could handle the situation.

26:48.999 --> 26:52.026
(somber music)

26:53.428 --> 26:55.003
Money's not a problem,
whatever it costs.

26:55.022 --> 26:58.616
- You're not seriously asking me
what I think you're asking me?

27:01.528 --> 27:02.769
Are you crazy?

27:02.863 --> 27:04.955
You can't talk like that,
especially not to me.

27:05.107 --> 27:06.348
- You're my brother.
- I'm a cop!

27:06.350 --> 27:08.942
- He's in my home
with my family!

27:09.019 --> 27:10.853
- And where were you
when that was going on?

27:10.855 --> 27:12.445
That's beside the point,
alright?

27:12.465 --> 27:13.797
The point is,

27:14.634 --> 27:16.358
if anything happens to that guy,

27:16.451 --> 27:18.877
anything at all,
it comes back on you.

27:18.954 --> 27:20.195
Quick.

27:20.197 --> 27:21.713
You think losing
your family sucks?

27:21.790 --> 27:24.683
You try spending the rest
of your life in Fed Max.

27:32.485 --> 27:33.984
- Okay, you're right.

27:36.972 --> 27:39.323
- Let's both pretend that
this never happened.

27:39.942 --> 27:43.619
- Eric, I know that
I have not been...

27:44.405 --> 27:45.237
(scoffing)

27:45.313 --> 27:47.456
even a good brother to you...

27:48.409 --> 27:51.627
but we're still brothers,
right?

27:56.066 --> 27:57.091
- Always.

27:59.420 --> 28:01.995
- Then I need you to help me
figure out another way

28:02.014 --> 28:03.514
to deal with this.

28:14.435 --> 28:17.027
(indistinct chattering)
(cars honking)

28:20.199 --> 28:21.440
- What are you two doing today?

28:21.516 --> 28:23.659
- Uh, strip club buffet. You?

28:24.870 --> 28:26.078
- I was just asking.

28:28.432 --> 28:31.191
Jason, you...
you lost the appeal.

28:31.952 --> 28:34.044
How much longer
are we gonna do this?

28:35.272 --> 28:37.864
- I'm dropping the case, okay?

28:37.942 --> 28:41.468
(soft music)

28:43.055 --> 28:44.722
- Hi, Dad!
- Hey, buddy!

28:45.540 --> 28:47.373
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby. Have fun.

28:47.451 --> 28:49.059
Okay, listen to Daddy.
- Okay.

28:49.211 --> 28:50.894
- And call me before bed, okay?
- Okay.

28:51.121 --> 28:52.454
- Okay.
- Alright, let's go.

28:52.456 --> 28:53.522
- Okay.
- Bye.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.807
- Bye.
- Look at us!

28:55.901 --> 28:57.142
A couple of co-parents.

28:57.294 --> 28:59.236
Bet you thought I didn't
have it in me, huh?

29:09.248 --> 29:13.584
- I haven't been away like this
in forever?

29:14.736 --> 29:16.754
Since like before Ari.

29:17.331 --> 29:18.630
- You sure you're gonna be okay?

29:18.740 --> 29:20.073
- Yes!
(chuckling)

29:20.092 --> 29:24.928
I am now a fun, carefree
person who enjoys spontaneity.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.338
- Yeah.
(laughing)

29:26.414 --> 29:30.008
Yeah, I mean, no,
I'm convinced.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.676
(police sirens blaring)

29:31.753 --> 29:33.419
(suspenseful music)
- Was I speeding?

29:33.497 --> 29:34.254
- No.

29:34.331 --> 29:35.773
- I... I didn't do anything.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.065
What did I do?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.755
- License and registration.

30:00.782 --> 30:02.040
- Can I ask what this is about?

30:02.117 --> 30:04.134
- License and registration,
please.

30:14.129 --> 30:15.479
Ma'am, could you open the trunk?

30:16.148 --> 30:18.040
- Why?
- I'd like to take a look.

30:18.058 --> 30:19.224
- Don't you need a warrant?

30:19.376 --> 30:21.360
- I'll get you one
if you wanna wait.

30:23.714 --> 30:26.990
- Okay, sure, can you just
please be fast?

30:28.277 --> 30:29.993
- I need you both
to step out of the car.

30:30.645 --> 30:33.889
(police siren blaring)
(Kashir): It's okay.

30:33.907 --> 30:35.082
We're okay.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.171
(Officer Williams): Let's go.

30:41.582 --> 30:42.673
(female officer): You'll just
have to stand aside,

30:42.749 --> 30:43.489
please, sir.

30:43.658 --> 30:45.425
- Put your hands on the hood.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.570
(Kashir): Just do what he says.

30:48.589 --> 30:50.764
Officer, can I please ask
what this is about?

30:53.018 --> 30:55.435
(indistinct radio chatter)

30:56.580 --> 30:58.397
- That's my son's bag.

31:00.934 --> 31:02.434
- You're under arrest.
(Morgan): What is that?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.102
- You have the right
to remain silent.

31:04.179 --> 31:05.087
- Is this a joke?

31:05.089 --> 31:06.029
- ...may be held against you

31:06.106 --> 31:06.938
in a court of law.

31:07.091 --> 31:08.014
- That's not mine!

31:08.350 --> 31:11.017
Get off me! Get off!
That's not mine!

31:11.612 --> 31:15.497
- Police searched your home
and found 5 kg of cocaine.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.602
- I've never done cocaine
in my entire life,

31:20.621 --> 31:22.454
I certainly never sold it.

31:22.530 --> 31:24.456
- They also found scales
and baggies.

31:25.367 --> 31:28.368
- I'm telling you,
this is my ex-husband.

31:28.445 --> 31:29.778
He's trying to punish me.

31:29.871 --> 31:32.372
- The prosecution has
corroborating phone records

31:32.391 --> 31:34.950
and bank statements showing
large sums of money.

31:34.968 --> 31:36.468
- Jason did that!
It's Jason!

31:36.562 --> 31:40.972
- If he is setting you up, he is
doing a hell of a thorough job.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.358
- You, you believe me, right?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.570
- It doesn't matter
what I believe,

31:46.797 --> 31:48.614
my job is to defend you.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.076
My client is her son's
primary caregiver.

31:53.228 --> 31:56.821
She's a law-abiding mother
and a public school educator.

31:57.399 --> 32:00.325
We request that she be released
on bail until trial.

32:00.402 --> 32:03.495
Your Honour, the State believes
she's a flight risk,

32:03.571 --> 32:05.497
given the preponderance
of evidence

32:05.649 --> 32:06.924
and her history of drug charges.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.484
- My client was ticketed for
smoking a joint in public

32:09.486 --> 32:12.078
when she was 17.
That is hardly a history.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.579
- I'm inclined to agree
with defence.

32:13.657 --> 32:16.341
- Your Honour, before you make
this ruling,

32:16.994 --> 32:19.436
consider the testimony
of our witness.

32:21.181 --> 32:23.482
- What is he talking about?
What witness?

32:26.670 --> 32:27.760
(Eric): Yeah, we're good.

32:28.763 --> 32:30.338
I'm just locking
everything down with my guy.

32:30.432 --> 32:31.949
- You're sure he can do this?

32:32.100 --> 32:33.008
<i> - Oh, he's a born liar,</i>

32:33.026 --> 32:33.951
so yeah.

32:34.027 --> 32:34.934
<i> - You're coming through</i>

32:35.012 --> 32:35.953
for me, Eric.

32:36.029 --> 32:36.936
Big time.

32:37.439 --> 32:39.164
- Well, you're my brother,
right?

32:42.703 --> 32:45.295
- Yo, what if they ask me
a question I don't know
the answer to?

32:45.372 --> 32:46.855
- Just say you don't know.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.708
And if they keep asking,
shut your mouth.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.694
- This uh, this brother of yours
I've never heard of,

32:52.696 --> 32:54.295
rolling on his ex like this?

32:54.974 --> 32:56.622
That's cold business, man.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.082
She's gonna do a lot
of time inside.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.810
- Let's just go over
the story again.

32:59.845 --> 33:00.978
(scoffing)

33:01.129 --> 33:02.396
- Alright.

33:08.879 --> 33:10.404
(soft music)

33:17.329 --> 33:18.495
- Hey.

33:21.892 --> 33:23.892
They dropped the charges
against me.

33:24.228 --> 33:25.577
(sigh of relief)
- Thank God.

33:25.653 --> 33:28.005
- Now, we just gotta get
this cleared up.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.237
- I feel like I'm in a nightmare
and I can't wake up.

33:35.239 --> 33:38.098
- Hey, we'll get this sorted,
alright?

33:40.035 --> 33:43.020
Listen, I spoke
to your lawyer this morning.

33:43.096 --> 33:44.521
She said there's a witness?

33:45.582 --> 33:47.524
- That's...
it's complete crap.

33:47.751 --> 33:48.917
- So you don't even know him?

33:49.361 --> 33:51.677
- I've never laid eyes
on him in my life!

33:51.697 --> 33:54.990
And somehow, he knows
everything about me!

34:00.781 --> 34:01.997
(sniffling)

34:03.767 --> 34:05.600
Jason's brother Eric...

34:05.602 --> 34:07.118
he's part of this.

34:07.529 --> 34:08.628
I'm sure of it.

34:15.036 --> 34:15.886
(door opening)

34:15.962 --> 34:17.179
- I'm going to the courthouse.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.966
- You gonna tell me
what's going on?

34:22.561 --> 34:25.470
Did you have anything to do
with Morgan getting arrested?

34:26.065 --> 34:27.472
- What are you talking about?

34:28.233 --> 34:29.900
- You've been drinking
every day.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.735
More than usual.

34:31.812 --> 34:33.052
Barely sleeping.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.312
- It's just work.

34:34.464 --> 34:36.055
- It's been like this since
your brother came over

34:36.133 --> 34:37.265
that night.

34:37.317 --> 34:38.742
What has he gotten you into?

34:42.472 --> 34:44.564
Please, baby, just tell me--
- I have to go.

34:45.233 --> 34:46.975
- Okay. I'm coming with you.
- Please don't!

34:46.993 --> 34:49.144
(baby crying)

34:49.162 --> 34:50.645
You better go
and take care of him.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.407
- You're a good man, Eric,
but your heart's too big.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.426
Especially when it comes
to your brother.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.096
- I love you.

35:00.824 --> 35:01.798
(sighing)

35:01.875 --> 35:02.974
(door closing)

35:04.419 --> 35:06.494
(dean): The State would like
to call its next witness.

35:06.513 --> 35:09.481
The defendant's ex-husband,
Jason Knight.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.779
Were you and your ex-wife
both financial providers?

35:15.856 --> 35:18.949
- We both worked, but I was
the primary provider.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.175
- Was money an issue?

35:20.344 --> 35:23.787
- Only in that Morgan has
expensive taste.

35:23.938 --> 35:25.196
- How so?

35:25.349 --> 35:26.939
- She pushed us to buy
an apartment

35:26.959 --> 35:27.791
on the Upper East Side.

35:28.109 --> 35:29.459
Something frankly
we couldn't afford.

35:29.611 --> 35:31.703
- I mean, they're just going
to let him lie like this?

35:31.855 --> 35:32.370
- Take it easy.

35:32.522 --> 35:34.022
- After we split up,

35:34.040 --> 35:35.373
I don't know, I guess

35:35.450 --> 35:37.450
she had trouble weaning herself
from all that.

35:37.527 --> 35:39.544
I supported my wife and my son,

35:40.305 --> 35:43.807
but apparently, it uh,
it wasn't enough.

35:43.958 --> 35:46.226
- Objection, Your Honor.
Speculation.

35:47.704 --> 35:48.553
- We'll move on.

35:48.872 --> 35:52.983
Were you surprised to learn
of the charges

35:53.134 --> 35:54.133
against your ex-wife?

35:54.153 --> 35:55.877
- Yes. Absolutely.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.305
Although the more
I thought about it,
the more it made sense.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.899
(Morgan): Why are you
doing this?
- No.

36:01.051 --> 36:01.900
- Why are you doing it?

36:01.976 --> 36:02.717
You wanna put the mother

36:02.736 --> 36:03.551
of your child in jail?

36:03.553 --> 36:04.402
That's what you wanna do?!

36:04.554 --> 36:05.553
(Kate): You need to stop.

36:05.555 --> 36:06.979
(judge): That's enough,
Ms. Knight.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.481
- He's lying!
(Kate): Stop!

36:08.500 --> 36:09.315
- He's lying!

36:09.393 --> 36:10.408
- We will recess until

36:10.485 --> 36:12.744
until your client can
control herself,

36:12.820 --> 36:13.628
Ms. Chin.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.255
(sighing)

36:19.920 --> 36:22.679
(suspenseful music)

36:30.247 --> 36:31.262
(whispering): It's okay.

36:31.339 --> 36:33.565
I can figure this out.

36:37.696 --> 36:41.865
- I uh, saw you run outta there
like the place was on fire.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.075
Yeah, I can't do this, Jase.

36:44.778 --> 36:45.535
I can't.

36:46.096 --> 36:47.262
- I mean, it's already done.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.947
Now we just have
to let it play out.

36:49.766 --> 36:52.709
- Morgan hurt you,
but this is messed up.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.622
As much as you hate her, she's
still the mother of your son.

36:57.774 --> 36:58.715
- Hey. Hey.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.867
You did this to support
your family.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.129
Just like I'm gonna support you.
You're gonna be fine.

37:05.206 --> 37:07.641
Eric, huh? I promise.

37:08.785 --> 37:10.301
- I can't do this, man.
I can't!

37:10.395 --> 37:12.062
- Yeah, you can.
- No, I can't.

37:12.213 --> 37:14.789
- Stop whining
like a little bitch.

37:15.216 --> 37:16.566
- You're gonna keep
your mouth shut

37:16.643 --> 37:19.644
because you have as much
to lose now as anyone.

37:20.388 --> 37:23.389
You breathe a word about it,
a single word,

37:23.408 --> 37:25.742
and I will take you down
with me.

37:25.893 --> 37:27.535
That's a promise.

37:31.475 --> 37:32.732
(sighing)

37:32.751 --> 37:36.169
(somber music)

37:46.172 --> 37:46.930
(Jason): Regina.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.658
Hey, thanks for being here.
- Tell me what's going on,
Jason.

37:50.677 --> 37:52.102
What have you gotten Eric into?

37:52.178 --> 37:54.729
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.525
- Where is my husband?

38:01.929 --> 38:03.029
- I'll see you inside.

38:04.432 --> 38:07.534
- What are you doing here?
I told you not to come.

38:09.103 --> 38:13.164
- I'm your wife, why wouldn't
you want me here?

38:29.533 --> 38:31.290
(bailiff): Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

38:31.310 --> 38:32.884
and nothing but the truth?

38:32.960 --> 38:34.311
(Flaco): Yeah, I swear.

38:34.871 --> 38:35.812
(dean): Mr. Delgado,

38:36.148 --> 38:40.108
please describe your
relationship with the defendant.

38:40.802 --> 38:42.226
- She sold me drugs.

38:42.379 --> 38:46.881
For personal use, and I also
cut it to flip it on the street.

38:46.900 --> 38:48.399
- What kind of drugs?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.243
- White and brown.

38:50.904 --> 38:52.495
Cocaine and heroin.

38:53.481 --> 38:54.480
- How often?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.724
- Once a week.
Sometimes twice.

38:57.243 --> 38:59.077
- How long did this go on?

38:59.729 --> 39:03.064
- Uh, the guy I used to buy
from got shot, like what,

39:03.083 --> 39:04.174
three months ago?

39:04.676 --> 39:06.343
- Hey, hey. You need to
ask him something.

39:06.494 --> 39:08.494
- Morgan and I started
working together.
- Morgan Knight.

39:08.572 --> 39:09.253
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

39:09.997 --> 39:13.499
- I need to confirm we're
talking about the same person.

39:13.577 --> 39:15.410
- Is Ms. Knight
in the courtroom?

39:15.428 --> 39:16.853
- Yeah. That's her,
right there.

39:17.004 --> 39:18.021
- Final question.

39:18.098 --> 39:19.522
- Why are you testifying
here today?

39:19.599 --> 39:22.192
- I got booked selling
a bag in Inwood.

39:22.343 --> 39:24.252
You know, I gotta roll
on my connect.

39:24.254 --> 39:25.603
It's her or me, right?

39:26.106 --> 39:27.405
- No further questions.

39:28.258 --> 39:30.075
- Your witness, Ms. Chin.

39:33.446 --> 39:37.207
- Mr. Delgado, you claim to have
been buying drugs

39:37.283 --> 39:40.210
from the defendant
for the past three months.

39:40.286 --> 39:41.044
- Yeah.

39:41.788 --> 39:44.455
- Explain how a typical
transaction would work.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.049
Where would you meet?

39:46.126 --> 39:48.701
- Oh, 14th and 11th.
By the bodega.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.963
- And when would these
encounters take place?

39:51.965 --> 39:53.038
- Afternoons.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.949
She was on the way
to pick up her kid.

39:54.951 --> 39:55.783
- Mm.

39:56.453 --> 40:00.455
She picked up her son every day
from his school at 4:30.

40:00.899 --> 40:06.403
So, in between finishing her
job as a third-grade teacher

40:06.554 --> 40:09.964
and picking up her son,
she would stop

40:09.983 --> 40:11.908
and sell you narcotics?

40:12.577 --> 40:13.743
- Ain't that something?

40:13.895 --> 40:14.911
- The defendant is known

40:15.062 --> 40:17.080
to drive her car
to and from work.

40:17.157 --> 40:18.489
- I don't know how
she got where.

40:18.566 --> 40:21.251
- Well, she had her car
when she picked up her son,

40:21.327 --> 40:24.921
so it'd follow then that
she also had her car

40:24.998 --> 40:26.631
when she met you.
- Yeah.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.425
Yeah, that's right.

40:28.501 --> 40:31.169
- What was the make
and model of her car?

40:31.321 --> 40:34.822
- Uh, well, I'm not a car guy.

40:35.158 --> 40:36.174
I take the subway.

40:36.326 --> 40:37.842
- Native New Yorker?

40:37.919 --> 40:39.418
- Washington Heights.
Born and bred.

40:39.438 --> 40:42.939
- So, you couldn't say whether
she drove an Acura

40:43.016 --> 40:44.441
or a Camry or Focus or...

40:44.517 --> 40:47.018
(chuckling)
- They're all the same to me.

40:47.170 --> 40:48.111
- What about the colour?

40:48.262 --> 40:50.113
- The colour?
- Of the car.

40:51.024 --> 40:53.616
What was the colour
of my client's car?

40:54.177 --> 40:55.243
(nervous chuckle)

40:56.362 --> 40:57.028
- I don't know.

40:57.104 --> 40:58.604
- You were buying drugs

40:58.665 --> 41:00.047
from my client once a week,

41:00.107 --> 41:04.109
sometimes twice, every week
for the past three months

41:04.129 --> 41:05.853
and you don't know
the colour of her car?

41:05.872 --> 41:08.506
- Nope.
- Was it dark or light?

41:11.361 --> 41:12.710
- I think it was dark.

41:12.862 --> 41:14.378
- So, it was
a normal-looking car.

41:14.531 --> 41:16.197
It was a normal-looking colour.

41:16.199 --> 41:17.623
It made no impression
whatsoever.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.383
Is that correct?
- Yeah.

41:20.553 --> 41:24.555
- Would it surprise you to learn
that my client drives

41:24.632 --> 41:26.065
a bright yellow Porsche?

41:27.043 --> 41:30.061
(people murmuring)

41:30.213 --> 41:33.156
(Judge Cabrera):
Once in a while, more often
than I'd like to admit,

41:33.233 --> 41:34.807
a case is brought before
this court.

41:34.901 --> 41:36.551
One that challenges
the integrity

41:36.569 --> 41:38.978
of those law enforcement
officers that would abuse

41:38.997 --> 41:40.145
their sacred duty.

41:40.907 --> 41:43.407
I believe this is one
of those cases.

41:43.484 --> 41:46.894
Morgan Knight, the court drops
all charges against you.

41:46.896 --> 41:51.082
On behalf of the State of New
York, please accept my apology.

41:51.659 --> 41:53.593
You are free to go.

41:54.904 --> 41:55.845
Court is adjourned.

41:55.922 --> 41:56.971
(gavel slamming)

41:57.999 --> 42:01.392
(dramatic music)

42:08.193 --> 42:09.609
(sigh of relief)
- Let's go home.

42:14.274 --> 42:15.073
- Jase.

42:16.109 --> 42:18.926
Jase, where are you
going? Jason!

42:18.945 --> 42:21.871
- Eric Knight?
You are under arrest.

42:22.599 --> 42:24.356
You have the right
to remain silent.

42:24.376 --> 42:28.545
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in court.

42:35.536 --> 42:38.555
(children playing)

42:39.891 --> 42:41.891
(soft piano music)

42:42.043 --> 42:43.542
- Ooh!
- Nice catch.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.287
- Ooh! I like your technique.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.047
- Pretty good.
You're not too bad yourself.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.291
(laughing)
(Ari): Do it really far
this time.

42:50.310 --> 42:51.309
- How far you want it?

42:51.385 --> 42:53.127
- As far as you can throw it.

42:53.146 --> 42:54.979
- Alright. Ready?
- Yeah.

42:55.131 --> 42:56.555
- Go!
- Woo!

42:57.409 --> 43:00.243
He keeps asking to go back
to the Chinese restaurant.

43:00.394 --> 43:02.320
- Again?
- He loves the spare ribs.

43:02.396 --> 43:03.746
(laughing)

43:03.898 --> 43:04.998
- I don't blame him.

43:10.237 --> 43:11.421
(Jason): Hey, bud.
