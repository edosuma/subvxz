Maybe you wanna

I'm sorry. I gotta go.

29:09.203 --> 29:10.662
And thanks for dinner.

29:11.330 --> 29:12.372
You brought it!

29:12.372 --> 29:15.709
(door opens, closes)

29:16.293 --> 29:17.169
So, what do you think?

29:18.003 --> 29:20.130
Hmm? Who breaks whose heart?

29:22.591 --> 29:23.550
Oh, you mean them?

29:25.052 --> 29:28.388
I think she needs him
more than he needs her.

29:29.431 --> 29:32.434
Which will make her more
desperate to keep going.

29:34.686 --> 29:36.563
Even if the right thing to do
is to walk away.

29:37.523 --> 29:40.025
My experience?
It's never equal.

29:40.776 --> 29:42.945
There's always one person
who feels it stronger
than the other person.

29:43.821 --> 29:44.822
And you're never that person.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.241
You said that, right?

29:47.908 --> 29:48.826
You've never been in love.

29:50.619 --> 29:51.411
Mm‐mm.

29:53.121 --> 29:54.873
Maybe that's
your parents' fault.

29:54.873 --> 29:55.958
How do you figure?

29:55.958 --> 29:59.044
Maybe they set
this impossible standard

29:59.044 --> 30:00.546
that you can never
measure up to.

30:01.088 --> 30:02.422
So you don't try.

Maybe if you ever saw them
struggle as a couple.

(door closes)

33:17.993 --> 33:20.078
I ended up down by the pool
talking to a boy.

33:20.078 --> 33:21.496
Oh, good.

33:21.496 --> 33:23.582
You flirted a little?
That can help.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.543
No, Mami. God, it wasn't
like that at all.

33:27.586 --> 33:28.879
I'm‐I'm sorry.

33:30.005 --> 33:31.840
I'm saying all the wrong things.

33:34.301 --> 33:36.970
How is it possible I know
so little about my girls?

33:37.971 --> 33:40.265
I didn't know your sister
was so angry.

33:41.850 --> 33:42.934
And you.

33:44.061 --> 33:45.854
We nearly talk every day and...

33:46.772 --> 33:49.649
I know nothing about who
this boy is, or how he hurt you,

33:49.649 --> 33:51.401
or even what you loved
about him.

33:52.402 --> 33:53.528
Why?

33:55.238 --> 33:56.573
Is it because you think I...

33:58.033 --> 33:58.867
I can't help?

34:01.495 --> 34:02.996
Maybe I can't.

34:02.996 --> 34:04.873
Maybe mothering is
just like a muscle

34:04.873 --> 34:07.042
and if you don't use it‐it‐it...

34:07.042 --> 34:08.168
It withers away.

34:08.168 --> 34:09.795
It's not that.

34:09.795 --> 34:12.172
Mami... it's not you.

34:18.512 --> 34:19.513
Well, um...

34:26.394 --> 34:28.897
He's someone I met
at Dream for Justice.

34:30.732 --> 34:33.735
He has more experience
as an activist and he
wanted to teach me.

34:36.154 --> 34:38.865
He said I had a unique voice.

34:40.158 --> 34:41.952
And he wanted me to trust it.

34:41.952 --> 34:42.994
To use it.

34:45.455 --> 34:46.915
And when I did...

34:49.584 --> 34:51.795
The way he looked at me
made me feel like...

34:53.505 --> 34:55.382
I don't know,
like‐like I just,

34:55.382 --> 34:56.842
she was just the key
that unlocked me

34:56.842 --> 34:58.885
like I‐I just opened up
somehow. I‐‐

35:00.387 --> 35:01.430
"She"?

35:06.351 --> 35:08.770
Uh, he. I‐I meant "he."

35:13.608 --> 35:15.485
I meant he, Mami.

35:18.947 --> 35:21.867
Tomorrow, we each come
with five new song ideas.

35:21.867 --> 35:24.911
Mm‐hmm. And we agree
to be totally open‐minded
about everything.

35:24.911 --> 35:26.079
No vetoing.

35:30.417 --> 35:31.209
Don't toss that.

35:33.253 --> 35:35.046
Rafa likes to have

That sounds fun, doesn't it?

What does Valentina
want to do, hmm?

37:22.779 --> 37:24.281
Why is it her choice?

37:24.281 --> 37:27.117
Because she made
this visit possible.

37:27.117 --> 37:29.869
And I think it was
very important for her.

37:29.869 --> 37:31.830
So she gets to pick.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.915
‐I don't care.
‐Sure you do.

37:34.374 --> 37:37.252
Um, maybe there's, you know,
an amusement park around here

37:37.252 --> 37:39.254
or maybe a zoo.
Something fun for Rafa.

37:46.845 --> 37:48.471
Lucia:
You? Do?

37:48.888 --> 37:50.849
Yes. I think it's important.

37:51.558 --> 37:52.559
At a time like this.

37:53.018 --> 37:54.436
At a time like what, Javi?

37:54.978 --> 37:57.147
When we are together
as a family.

37:58.106 --> 38:00.859
There's a cathedral
in a plaza nearby.

38:00.859 --> 38:02.027
We can take a bus.

38:03.111 --> 38:04.946
Well, that's not
super high on my list

38:04.946 --> 38:07.532

to you guys, sure.

I'm not going to church.

38:16.041 --> 38:17.709
‐What?
‐Why not?

38:17.709 --> 38:20.420
You always wanna go to church.

38:45.945 --> 38:47.155
Okay? Ah?

38:47.155 --> 38:49.074
I'll stay here with Rafa.

38:49.074 --> 38:52.202
