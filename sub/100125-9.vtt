I know that our old normal

43:28.271 --> 43:30.674
is hitting the road
and seeing where we land,

43:30.707 --> 43:33.176
but I thought we should
stay in Reston this time,

43:33.209 --> 43:34.511
and you can finish school.

And we could put
a coffee table here,

43:38.682 --> 43:40.384
a couch there,
or maybe a loveseat

43:40.417 --> 43:42.051

for the bedroom,

test out real ones.

Bill Boone's insurance company

44:03.874 --> 44:05.843
sent us a liability check.
