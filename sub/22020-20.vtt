WEBVTT

00:04.781 --> 00:07.248
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

00:08.917 --> 00:12.077
- You brought me coffee?
- Yeah.

00:13.538 --> 00:16.207
You realize, I think the last
time you brought me coffee,

00:16.273 --> 00:18.007
we were riding in a squad together.

00:18.042 --> 00:20.944
Well, return to basics is good.

00:20.978 --> 00:22.697
That right?

00:23.013 --> 00:26.649
I didn't realize either one of
us missed your burnt coffee.

00:31.555 --> 00:33.763
What the hell's is going on, Al?

00:36.506 --> 00:38.474
Terry from Narcotics
called me last night.

00:38.537 --> 00:43.132
Ruben Gilbright's
possession charge was dropped.

00:44.568 --> 00:46.649
So...

00:47.738 --> 00:49.172
Huh.

00:49.206 --> 00:50.974
My plan didn't work.

00:51.008 --> 00:52.442
Woods is protecting him.

00:52.476 --> 00:54.987
Wants to make sure
he can testify against me.

00:55.081 --> 00:56.761
All right.

00:57.915 --> 00:59.782
If Internal Affairs is gonna
show up on my door with, uh...

00:59.817 --> 01:02.118
- an arrest warrant...
- Al, I'm not gonna...

01:02.152 --> 01:03.720
I'm not gonna let it get that far.

01:03.754 --> 01:05.188
Yes, you are.

01:05.221 --> 01:06.823
For both our sakes, yes, you are.

01:06.857 --> 01:09.792
Hank, we let it come.

01:09.827 --> 01:12.743
Because in the end,
they won't have enough.

01:12.881 --> 01:14.916
So we let it hit me.

01:15.232 --> 01:18.311
I go through it. Deal with the hell.

01:18.769 --> 01:21.241
And we come out the other side.

01:21.538 --> 01:24.173
That's the way we both get saved here.

01:27.845 --> 01:29.946
Okay?

01:36.253 --> 01:38.098
Boss.

01:42.226 --> 01:44.160
All right, so my contact
in the ASA's office

01:44.194 --> 01:45.495
is in court until this afternoon.

01:45.529 --> 01:47.004
As soon as she's out, I'll have answers.

01:47.051 --> 01:48.685
If it's on the move,
she'll know about it.

01:48.719 --> 01:50.720
Listen, I need more than
just confirmation.

01:50.754 --> 01:52.856
I need details if I'm gonna
outrun this, okay?

01:52.890 --> 01:53.901
Copy that, yeah.

01:53.936 --> 01:55.568
All right, no one can know
it came from me.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.799
- No, of course.
- Hank.

01:56.824 --> 01:58.628
- Yeah?
- A teenage girl was just here

01:58.662 --> 02:00.797
looking for you.
Said her name was Hannah.

02:00.831 --> 02:02.932
- Hannah?
- Yeah, I tried to get her

02:02.967 --> 02:05.579
to stick around while I called
you but she said she couldn't.

02:05.604 --> 02:07.055
She ran out of here and left you that.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.947
- Thanks.
- Okay.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.101 --> 02:19.936
You okay, boss?

02:19.970 --> 02:21.337
Yeah.

02:21.363 --> 02:23.734
Come on, let's take a ride.

02:27.444 --> 02:30.246
Hannah Cates, no priors.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.648
Last known address is
from a few years ago.

02:32.683 --> 02:35.852
Apartment in West Clearing.
This is her...

02:35.886 --> 02:37.787
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she's 18 now.

02:37.821 --> 02:39.622
This is a kid you gave your card to?

02:39.656 --> 02:41.157
No, it's just a kid I met.

02:41.191 --> 02:42.625
I mean, a long time ago.

02:42.659 --> 02:44.127
She involved in anything?

02:44.161 --> 02:46.763
No, never was.

02:46.797 --> 02:48.135
All right, this is the place.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.861
I'll take inside, you take out.

02:50.034 --> 02:51.934
If she's not there, I'll give her 20.

02:51.969 --> 02:54.771
- Then we'll call it.
- Sounds good, boss.

02:55.806 --> 02:57.807
Hey.

03:12.065 --> 03:14.336
Adam, I got her in sight. Hang tight.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.360
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Hannah?

03:17.088 --> 03:18.680
Hey.

03:21.198 --> 03:23.045
Here, have a seat.

03:24.850 --> 03:26.469
Sure you don't want any coffee?

03:26.503 --> 03:29.069
- Yeah.
- Breakfast?

03:30.674 --> 03:33.476
- Got good eggs here.
- No, I can't.

03:33.510 --> 03:35.945
I'm good. Thanks.

03:41.952 --> 03:43.721
What's going on?

03:44.021 --> 03:45.916
I was just wondering

03:46.056 --> 03:48.429
what would happen if...

03:49.460 --> 03:51.296
if I needed help.

03:52.296 --> 03:53.780
Then I would help you.

03:58.569 --> 04:00.655
Listen, I'm sorry.

04:01.109 --> 04:04.030
I mean, I know it's been a while, I...

04:04.108 --> 04:05.341
That's okay.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.677
You never owed me anything.

04:07.711 --> 04:09.946
My aunt told me what happened.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.048
With your son.

04:12.082 --> 04:13.382
I'm sorry.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.084
It must have broke you.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.457
Hey.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.356
Whatever it is...

04:24.128 --> 04:26.062
We can work it out.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.033
I'm gonna help you.

04:34.471 --> 04:35.805
Guess I could eat some eggs.

04:35.839 --> 04:38.908
Okay, good, let's do that. Okay?

04:38.942 --> 04:39.842
Hey...

04:39.877 --> 04:42.245
I just need to run
to the bathroom first,

04:42.279 --> 04:44.380
- and then we can order?
- Sure.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.115
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.633
- Some menus?
- Yeah.

05:05.269 --> 05:07.770
Excuse me.

05:09.306 --> 05:11.641
Ruz, keep an anchor down out front.

05:11.675 --> 05:15.144
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

05:15.179 --> 05:18.147
- All good?
- No, she bolted.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.318
All right, keep your eyes open.

05:22.352 --> 05:26.088
Grey hoodie, blue jeans.

05:28.192 --> 05:29.425
I got her.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.593
She's heading east in the alley.

05:30.627 --> 05:33.304
Hannah! Hey!

05:33.329 --> 05:34.763
Hey!

05:49.479 --> 05:52.381
5021 Emergency Squad, we are in pursuit

05:52.416 --> 05:54.784
of a silver Toyota Land Cruiser.

05:54.818 --> 05:58.221
Last seen headed southbound
on Noble and Hubbard.

05:58.255 --> 05:59.789
High rate of speed.

05:59.823 --> 06:01.691
Partial plate: 8-4-2.

06:01.725 --> 06:04.493
Offenders wanted for
possible aggravated kidnapping.

06:04.528 --> 06:07.196
One male, Hispanic, armed.
White male driver.

06:07.231 --> 06:08.798
Boss, what the hell is going on here?

06:08.832 --> 06:11.067
<i>Copy that, 5021 squad.</i>

06:11.101 --> 06:14.036
Sarge, we have 112 hits
on that partial plate.

06:14.071 --> 06:16.138
We're sorting through them
looking for one registered

06:16.173 --> 06:17.506
to a Land Cruiser.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.342
Hailey's accessing the traffic cams,

06:19.376 --> 06:20.977
but we don't have a bead on Hannah.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.812
Now, she doesn't have
a cell phone registered to her

06:22.846 --> 06:24.580
so I can't do an emergency ping...

06:24.615 --> 06:26.682
Kim. Late model silver Land Cruiser

06:26.717 --> 06:28.684
partial plate: 8-4-2,
passed a traffic camera

06:28.719 --> 06:31.220
six minutes ago, 16th and State.

06:33.190 --> 06:34.991
Hailey, we don't have them.
Did the eye in the sky

06:35.025 --> 06:37.193
- get them past 16th?
<i>- Checking.</i>

06:38.695 --> 06:40.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Behind, behind, behind.

06:40.697 --> 06:43.065
5021 Ida, we got shots fired
at 16th and State.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.601
Be advised: plainclothes
officers responding.

06:45.636 --> 06:48.004
<i>Copy that, 5021 Ida.</i>

06:53.944 --> 06:56.012
5021 Ida, those shots fired
are coming from

06:56.046 --> 06:59.248
the South 1600 block,
North Schiller Credit Union.

07:09.459 --> 07:11.861
It's locked.

07:24.408 --> 07:26.575
Go.

07:33.317 --> 07:36.218
- Ruzek, you okay?
- I'm good. Stay down.

07:40.424 --> 07:43.159
10-1, 10-1, we got shots
fired at the police.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.894
We got a bona fide robbery happening

07:44.928 --> 07:47.930
at North Schiller Credit Union.

07:55.672 --> 07:57.940
Gun!

08:13.156 --> 08:14.790
Go!

08:18.195 --> 08:22.598
5021, Land Cruiser fleeing
southbound towards 18th street.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.301
Young, David, Henry, 8-4-2.

08:26.803 --> 08:28.304
All right, just stay calm.

08:28.338 --> 08:30.005
Keep pressure right there, all right?

08:30.040 --> 08:31.674
You ready? This is gonna hurt.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.176
Aah!

08:34.211 --> 08:38.147
Get me an ambulance.
1656 South State Street.

08:38.181 --> 08:40.982
<i>Copy that.</i>

08:43.486 --> 08:46.155
Hailey, we backing up
Robbery Homicide on this?

08:46.189 --> 08:47.857
No, we're taking it.
Voight and Ruzek were here

08:47.891 --> 08:49.291
when it kicked off. It was on the heels

08:49.326 --> 08:50.493
of an abduction.

08:50.527 --> 08:52.228
All right, Hannah Cates. She's 18.

08:52.262 --> 08:54.964
Left my card and a note
at the front desk this morning,

08:54.998 --> 08:57.400
wanted help, I met her. She bolted.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.802
And was grabbed right outside
the coffee shop.

08:59.836 --> 09:01.137
Stranger abduction?

09:01.171 --> 09:03.038
It felt like she knew these guys.

09:03.073 --> 09:05.474
So, where was Hannah during the robbery?

09:05.509 --> 09:07.009
Tied up in the backseat, trunk.

09:07.043 --> 09:08.811
Dropped at a second location.

09:08.845 --> 09:11.013
We lost eyes on that car
for like 12 minutes.

09:11.047 --> 09:13.849
Ah, the employee's on his way to Med.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.851
Bullet severed his femoral, so...

09:15.886 --> 09:17.820
Witnesses say it happened quick.

09:17.854 --> 09:20.089
Credit Union opened,
offenders barged inside.

09:20.123 --> 09:23.392
No one mentioned seeing
a teenage girl, though, boss.

09:23.427 --> 09:25.494
All right, Hailey, head up
the scene inside.

09:25.529 --> 09:27.663
All right, let's talk to
the FBI, see if this matches

09:27.697 --> 09:28.864
a robbery pattern.

09:28.899 --> 09:30.666
Antonio, get a bead on Hannah for me.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.101
Her aunt is Anne Cates.

09:32.135 --> 09:34.403
That's her legal guardian
but the last known address

09:34.438 --> 09:35.738
on file is vacant.

09:35.772 --> 09:38.040
I'll track her down.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.711
My contact in the
ASA's office is out of court.

09:42.746 --> 09:44.213
I can hold off.

09:44.247 --> 09:45.381
No, go now.

09:45.415 --> 09:47.550
You got it.

10:08.472 --> 10:10.372
Oh, man.

10:12.976 --> 10:15.878
Hey, what did Voight mean,
Hannah had his card?

10:15.912 --> 10:16.946
His business card?

10:16.980 --> 10:18.314
That's his thing.

10:18.348 --> 10:20.082
He's given out a bunch over the years.

10:20.116 --> 10:22.952
Usually kids that grew up
in rough neighborhoods.

10:22.986 --> 10:25.421
Looks after them.

10:26.089 --> 10:28.324
Gave one to Lindsay when she was 14.

10:28.358 --> 10:30.559
That's why she said Voight saved her.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.561
Yeah?

10:32.596 --> 10:34.530
That is a thing.

10:37.601 --> 10:41.337
They couldn't have gotten much
out of the registers.

10:41.371 --> 10:43.939
Yeah, teller said there
was less than three grand.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.674
Real payload was in the back.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.910
Well, it's not a good sign.

10:47.944 --> 10:50.079
They should've used
both employees back here.

10:50.113 --> 10:51.347
One opens the registers,

10:51.381 --> 10:53.516
the other accesses the back door.

10:53.550 --> 10:57.453
Helps obey the Two Minute Rule.
Lessens the small bills.

10:57.487 --> 11:00.122
They didn't need
to fire 80 rounds, either.

11:00.156 --> 11:01.657
Damn hard for a man who's bleeding out

11:01.691 --> 11:03.926
to open a security door.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.195
I hated ones like this
in Robbery Homicide.

11:06.229 --> 11:08.297
Worst crews, highest body counts.

11:08.331 --> 11:09.798
They're the ones that
don't know what the hell

11:09.833 --> 11:13.135
they're doing.

11:13.169 --> 11:15.371
No match on ballistics, at all.

11:15.405 --> 11:17.873
AK's are clean,
the SUV popped up stolen.

11:17.908 --> 11:18.974
Cold trail, so far.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.276
I know you saw a Beretta

11:20.310 --> 11:21.844
on the offender who abducted Hannah.

11:21.878 --> 11:23.112
But they didn't use it at the scene.

11:23.146 --> 11:24.847
Yeah, and there's no trackers.

11:24.881 --> 11:26.282
Or dye packs on this money.

11:26.316 --> 11:28.617
IDOC did send me a list of
cats on parole

11:28.652 --> 11:30.819
with similar backgrounds,
but we can't do anything

11:30.854 --> 11:31.954
with this list, Sarge.

11:31.988 --> 11:33.455
Nobody's staying in jail anymore.

11:33.490 --> 11:35.357
Hannah's aunt is proving
difficult to find.

11:35.392 --> 11:37.560
The vacant on file
was cleared out a year ago.

11:37.594 --> 11:39.495
Anne left a forwarding address.

11:39.529 --> 11:41.630
I checked, but the landlord
said she was only there

11:41.665 --> 11:43.299
- a month.
- Well, that's not good,

11:43.333 --> 11:44.967
because every piece of paper
we have on Hannah is dated

11:45.001 --> 11:46.335
from that move. Health insurance,

11:46.369 --> 11:48.304
cell phone registration,
school enrollment.

11:48.338 --> 11:51.307
And the last time Anne filed
taxes, she made about 14 grand.

11:51.341 --> 11:52.808
That's well below the poverty line.

11:52.842 --> 11:53.976
Probably crashing with family.

11:54.010 --> 11:56.145
No, there is no other family.

11:56.179 --> 11:58.380
Anne's brother,
Hannah's dad, he's in jail.

11:58.415 --> 12:00.683
Got busted for dealing four years ago.

12:00.717 --> 12:02.351
Is that how you met Hannah?

12:02.385 --> 12:04.520
No, I've known her since she was seven.

12:05.755 --> 12:07.423
Got a whole lot of nothing.

12:07.457 --> 12:10.359
No DNA, and the gloves they
wore gave us zero fingerprints.

12:10.393 --> 12:11.994
About the only thing
they did by the book.

12:12.028 --> 12:13.729
We didn't have eyes in the back alley

12:13.763 --> 12:17.066
but we got footage inside.

12:22.906 --> 12:24.239
Damn.

12:38.321 --> 12:40.723
That's all of it.
That's not a lot to go on.

12:40.757 --> 12:42.391
Look, 12 minutes before that robbery,

12:42.425 --> 12:45.103
those two men forced Hannah into a car.

12:45.128 --> 12:46.261
Why?

12:46.296 --> 12:48.197
Okay, until something
pops on the robbery,

12:48.231 --> 12:49.898
let's start with the abduction.

12:49.933 --> 12:51.767
So find Hannah's aunt.

12:51.801 --> 12:52.935
Where they've been living.

12:52.969 --> 12:54.370
Who have they been in contact with?

12:54.404 --> 12:57.006
That's gonna lead to
who the hell took her.

12:59.309 --> 13:00.943
She give you an answer?

13:00.977 --> 13:03.379
Special Grand Jury has
already been summoned.

13:04.981 --> 13:05.981
Who's the prosecutor?

13:06.016 --> 13:09.051
James Osha.

13:09.085 --> 13:11.320
Boss, hey...

13:11.354 --> 13:13.622
They're gonna convene in 48 hours.

13:13.657 --> 13:16.091
We'll be fine.

13:25.381 --> 13:28.349
I don't even understand how
you guys tracked me down.

13:29.195 --> 13:31.229
Well, your Link card is
registered to this address.

13:31.279 --> 13:32.909
Oh.

13:33.014 --> 13:36.316
Uh, so something really
happened to my niece, Hannah?

13:36.351 --> 13:40.220
I saw you guys and I just
figured you were cops he sent.

13:41.022 --> 13:43.008
Cops, who sent? What?

13:43.136 --> 13:45.037
That sergeant.

13:45.126 --> 13:46.960
But Hannah doesn't live with me anymore,

13:46.995 --> 13:49.329
so I guess there's no need for
a check-in, huh?

13:49.364 --> 13:51.555
Sergeant Hank Voight
checks in on Hannah?

13:51.586 --> 13:55.202
Yeah, he did, but like
I said, she's not here, so...

13:55.236 --> 13:56.460
She's 18.

13:56.505 --> 13:58.840
Okay.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.374
When was the last time you saw her?

14:00.408 --> 14:01.788
I don't know, she's on her own.

14:01.813 --> 14:04.444
Uh, wait, but you don't
remember when you saw her last?

14:04.479 --> 14:07.547
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, what about her current address?

14:07.582 --> 14:08.715
She just said she found a place.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.684
She didn't give me an address.

14:10.718 --> 14:12.219
Look, Anne...

14:12.253 --> 14:14.221
I'm sorry if we miscommunicated
with you,

14:14.255 --> 14:16.890
but we believe that Hannah's in
some pretty serious danger.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.792
So, anything you can tell us...

14:18.826 --> 14:21.361
Last time you saw her,
who she was with...

14:21.396 --> 14:22.729
Any of that might help us.

14:22.764 --> 14:25.032
- Anything.
- Come on.

14:28.903 --> 14:31.238
When's the last time Hannah
actually lived with you?

14:31.272 --> 14:32.572
Hannah's 18.

14:32.607 --> 14:34.207
Yeah, but that's not what he asked.

14:34.242 --> 14:36.677
Look, I took good care of
that girl for a real long time.

14:36.711 --> 14:37.744
She's not even my kid.

14:37.779 --> 14:39.513
You wanna call Child Services?

14:39.547 --> 14:41.848
Go ahead. She wanted to be on her own.

14:41.883 --> 14:43.316
She was old enough
to take care of herself.

14:43.351 --> 14:44.718
She was 16,

14:44.752 --> 14:47.320
a whole year older than
I was when I left home.

14:52.960 --> 14:57.931
All I know is that she left
to live with her friend...

14:57.965 --> 15:00.901
Addie. Something... Sumpter.

15:00.935 --> 15:03.336
Last I knew they were squatting
somewhere in Canaryville.

15:03.371 --> 15:06.273
Maybe.

15:06.307 --> 15:08.408
Okay.

15:22.790 --> 15:24.958
- Hey, Addie.
- Cops, cops!

15:24.992 --> 15:26.593
- Let's move!
- Hey, wait.

15:26.627 --> 15:27.594
- Calm down.
- Hey, hey.

15:27.628 --> 15:28.595
Addie! Addie!

15:28.629 --> 15:30.797
Come on. All right?

15:30.832 --> 15:32.566
Chill out.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.735
Okay, turn around, were you...
is that your space over there?

15:34.769 --> 15:36.636
Huh?

15:36.671 --> 15:38.972
All this destroyed area in here?

15:39.006 --> 15:41.374
You got stuff somewhere?

15:41.409 --> 15:42.476
Yes or no?

15:42.510 --> 15:43.977
You can't search my stuff.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.613
Actually, this property's
not yours, so...

15:46.647 --> 15:48.849
So just have at it then.

15:50.184 --> 15:51.818
Just sit down.

15:51.853 --> 15:53.487
Okay, we're not here to arrest you.

15:53.521 --> 15:54.988
We don't want to bring you in.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.556
We just wanna ask you
some questions about Hannah.

15:56.591 --> 15:58.325
Okay, does she live here?

15:58.359 --> 15:59.893
She's not here.

15:59.927 --> 16:02.329
So, when was
the last time you've seen her?

16:02.363 --> 16:04.064
No idea, I'm sorry.

16:04.098 --> 16:06.633
Well, I saw her this morning.

16:06.667 --> 16:10.570
Right before two guys with guns
shoved her into an SUV.

16:10.605 --> 16:13.173
And then they went
and robbed a credit union.

16:13.207 --> 16:16.009
Shot the place up. Left a guy for dead.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.844
Addie, this is your best friend.

16:17.879 --> 16:20.847
You know where she is?

16:20.882 --> 16:22.449
Addie, if you're
scared of somebody or any...

16:22.483 --> 16:25.152
I'm not scared. I don't know jack.

16:25.186 --> 16:26.853
I haven't talked to Hannah.

16:26.888 --> 16:28.622
- All right, come on.
- Wait, I thought you said

16:28.656 --> 16:30.824
- you weren't gonna take me in?
- Well, no, we didn't want to,

16:30.858 --> 16:32.959
but now we need to.

16:32.994 --> 16:35.328
That girl's scared, but I feel
like she knows something.

16:35.363 --> 16:37.197
She said that Hannah never
lived there with her

16:37.231 --> 16:39.432
but other squatters said they
did see another female there

16:39.467 --> 16:41.034
that matched Hannah's
description, but they can't

16:41.068 --> 16:42.636
recall a man ever being with her.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.138
Right, but it doesn't mean
they didn't meet men outside.

16:45.173 --> 16:47.274
Area Central's had that address flagged.

16:47.308 --> 16:48.775
And Vice has been doing routine sweeps

16:48.810 --> 16:50.043
in the adjoined alley each month.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.978
- You're thinking pimp?
- Maybe.

16:52.013 --> 16:53.513
The truth is, these girls
have been on the street

16:53.548 --> 16:56.349
for a year and a half, and
they've been exposed to a lot.

16:56.384 --> 16:59.653
You yourself said that it
looked like Hannah knew 'em.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.454
So...

17:01.489 --> 17:03.857
It's possible that
this guy was grooming her.

17:03.891 --> 17:05.692
And she didn't take well to it.
So she stepped out,

17:05.726 --> 17:06.992
went to your for help,

17:07.028 --> 17:08.328
and then they pull her
to keep her in line.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.030
- Hmm.
- I don't know, Jay.

17:10.064 --> 17:12.031
Pimps who sideline into armed robbery...

17:12.066 --> 17:14.034
These guys are not
professional bank robbers.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.301
They made that clear.

17:15.336 --> 17:16.736
This could be "anything for a buck."

17:16.771 --> 17:17.871
All right, where's Addie?

17:17.905 --> 17:19.472
She's with Ruzek. Not talking.

17:19.507 --> 17:20.874
Except to call the media.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.576
Okay.

17:22.609 --> 17:27.380
Listen, get on the horn with
Vice, run all this past them.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.818
- Hey, grab the door, will ya?
- Yeah.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.602
<i>You've reached James Osha.
Leave a message.</i>

18:01.649 --> 18:04.451
Sarge, a robbery in progress
just came over the zone.

18:04.485 --> 18:06.620
The hold up alarm was activated
at the Currency Exchange

18:06.654 --> 18:08.121
in Logan Square.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.456
Squads are in route but
the 911 caller is saying

18:09.490 --> 18:12.792
masked offenders with assault rifles.

18:27.008 --> 18:28.408
What the hell happened?

18:28.442 --> 18:31.211
Things went sideways fast.

18:36.817 --> 18:39.419
The kid was new. Started last week.

18:39.453 --> 18:41.321
Didn't have a key to the back vaults.

18:41.355 --> 18:43.323
There wasn't a manager on site?

18:43.357 --> 18:45.258
Well, you rob the place at closing.

18:45.293 --> 18:47.394
They could have just left but...

18:49.497 --> 18:52.465
Two masked male offenders. AK-47s.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.836
There were three offenders.
Two males, fit, 30s.

18:56.871 --> 18:59.139
And one female.

19:04.879 --> 19:06.846
Is that Hannah?

19:06.881 --> 19:08.636
She participated?

19:14.488 --> 19:16.181
Case should immediately be handed over

19:16.206 --> 19:17.220
to Robbery Homicide.

19:17.268 --> 19:18.568
Should have been theirs from the get.

19:18.603 --> 19:21.774
No. This whole case jumped off

19:21.829 --> 19:23.229
from an aggravated kidnapping

19:23.263 --> 19:24.998
that I witnessed while on duty.

19:25.032 --> 19:27.333
And now you've got three dead
and one in critical condition

19:27.368 --> 19:28.468
to show for it, Hank.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.136
It is not gonna serve anybody

19:30.170 --> 19:31.871
to yank this from Intelligence

19:31.905 --> 19:35.208
when we've been knee deep in it
for 24 hours, you know that.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.010
We got leads invested.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.845
Now please, just...

19:38.879 --> 19:40.847
have Area Central back us up.

19:40.881 --> 19:42.081
Fine.

19:42.116 --> 19:43.516
I'm gonna get Hannah's ID out

19:43.550 --> 19:45.718
with the robbery footage,
state wide to the media.

19:45.753 --> 19:47.653
Danny, you do that...

19:47.816 --> 19:50.384
This is gonna end like
90% of crime sprees do:

19:50.416 --> 19:52.150
- In bullets.
- You worried about

19:52.175 --> 19:53.791
- reform optics?
- No, I'm worried about

19:53.816 --> 19:57.163
an 18-year-old girl who
I think is being coerced.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.591
A girl I know,

19:58.859 --> 20:00.685
who came to me for help.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.037
Denny, I saw how she
reacted to the offenders.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.652
She was scared of them. They took her!

20:05.693 --> 20:07.727
You saying she's Patty Hearst?

20:07.752 --> 20:09.653
How do you even know this girl?

20:09.687 --> 20:12.322
Someone introduced me
to her a long time ago.

20:12.356 --> 20:14.324
And I haven't talked
to her in a few years.

20:14.358 --> 20:16.726
So, you don't know her
that well anymore?

20:16.761 --> 20:18.395
Right?

20:18.429 --> 20:22.132
I'm gonna put Hannah's ID out,
with the robbery footage.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.867
- All right?
- Denny...

20:24.836 --> 20:29.673
You know, Chief Lugo
just told me to call.

20:29.707 --> 20:32.242
But I figured I shouldn't waste
an opportunity to come by here

20:32.276 --> 20:34.344
while I still can.

20:34.378 --> 20:37.481
Because pretty soon you
and Al are gonna be, uh...

20:37.515 --> 20:39.783
Tied up.

20:42.453 --> 20:45.021
Damn shame about the girl.

20:45.056 --> 20:46.756
But you lay down with lions,

20:46.791 --> 20:49.459
you get hunted with them.

21:06.310 --> 21:07.811
What are you all waiting for?

21:07.845 --> 21:09.479
Tell me what we got.

21:09.514 --> 21:12.149
Um, ballistics was a match
at the credit union.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.683
We went back a month in security footage

21:13.718 --> 21:16.052
for both locations, nothing.
And no service calls

21:16.087 --> 21:17.954
- of suspicious persons.
- Hmm.

21:17.989 --> 21:20.157
I've been checking
PODS, traffic cams, CTA...

21:20.191 --> 21:22.025
nothing yet, Sarge. But they had to flee

21:22.059 --> 21:24.294
- the currency exchange somehow.
- All right, anything new

21:24.328 --> 21:25.695
- on Addie?
- Uh, Addie ain't

21:25.730 --> 21:27.564
talking, Sarge. She said she don't know

21:27.598 --> 21:29.232
those guys or what the hell
Hannah was doing with them.

21:29.267 --> 21:30.534
All right, well I'm gonna
take a run at it.

21:30.568 --> 21:32.736
Put a folder together for me, will ya?

21:32.770 --> 21:34.871
Get that footage from
the currency exchange for me.

21:34.906 --> 21:36.540
You know, if Addie's not gonna talk,

21:36.574 --> 21:38.642
then we'll just narrow
their IDs off Hannah.

21:38.676 --> 21:41.578
I mean, she knew these men.
Means she met them somewhere.

21:41.612 --> 21:43.246
Check every address that she lived at,

21:43.281 --> 21:45.882
hostels she crashed in,
her summer job at

21:45.917 --> 21:49.085
Harold Washington Library,
classes at Andrews High School,

21:49.120 --> 21:50.353
Jefferson Elementary...

21:50.388 --> 21:52.155
All places she potentially met them.

21:52.190 --> 21:53.723
All right, good, chase that.

21:53.758 --> 21:55.692
Hey, but let's not get tunnel vision.

21:55.726 --> 21:57.727
It's still possible Hannah
didn't know these men well

21:57.762 --> 21:59.663
- before they took her.
- Wait, you still want us

21:59.697 --> 22:01.198
running this like it's an abduction?

22:01.232 --> 22:03.099
I just wanna run wide.

22:03.134 --> 22:04.834
She participated.

22:04.869 --> 22:06.369
Come over here.

22:06.404 --> 22:08.238
Tell me something.

22:08.272 --> 22:11.808
That look like willing
participation to you?

22:14.879 --> 22:17.847
All right, it looks like a scared kid.

22:17.882 --> 22:20.183
But it also looks like
a girl who stood two feet

22:20.218 --> 22:22.519
from an open door for seven minutes.

22:22.553 --> 22:24.421
Who held a weapon. Could have ran,

22:24.455 --> 22:26.022
screamed for help, but she didn't.

22:26.057 --> 22:29.092
Yeah, she asked for help when
she walked in this district.

22:29.126 --> 22:30.927
And we didn't give it to her.

22:30.962 --> 22:35.498
I want it run fast and wide.

22:55.086 --> 22:57.921
You know who that is, right?

22:57.955 --> 23:00.357
Yep.

23:03.494 --> 23:06.062
That's your friend.

23:06.097 --> 23:08.098
That's Hannah.

23:08.132 --> 23:10.233
Right?

23:10.268 --> 23:13.770
Hannah.

23:13.804 --> 23:16.015
Who are they?

23:16.841 --> 23:18.492
This is your friend.

23:20.278 --> 23:22.335
Who are they?

23:22.980 --> 23:24.247
I have no idea.

23:24.282 --> 23:26.249
No idea?

23:26.284 --> 23:28.515
You know how long I can keep you here?

23:29.311 --> 23:31.914
I can make sure you never leave.

23:32.490 --> 23:34.257
I can make your life hell.

23:34.292 --> 23:36.571
And you still got
a lot of life left to live.

23:36.661 --> 23:38.629
He can't help you.

23:38.702 --> 23:41.063
He works for me.

23:46.570 --> 23:49.606
I can make this a lot of things, Addie.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.175
Obstruction of justice, conspiracy,

23:52.209 --> 23:54.978
accomplice to murder.

23:55.012 --> 23:56.813
- But I didn't...
- 'Cause I can already

23:56.847 --> 23:59.015
prove you're lying to me, Addie.

23:59.050 --> 24:01.785
I can charge you for that too
but we're talking about

24:01.819 --> 24:04.521
three homicides during a bank robbery...

24:04.555 --> 24:06.856
- But I wasn't there!
- And that makes you

24:06.891 --> 24:09.392
an accessory, which comes
with federal charges.

24:09.427 --> 24:10.960
- No, that's insane!
- And that is

24:10.995 --> 24:13.396
- the death penalty.
- But I'm not doing anything.

24:13.431 --> 24:16.866
You're getting your friend killed!

24:24.775 --> 24:27.344
Okay.

24:32.249 --> 24:35.452
Okay.

24:37.455 --> 24:39.356
The taller of the two's name is Mike.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.690
Okay.

24:40.725 --> 24:42.559
But the other one goes
by the name of "TT."

24:42.593 --> 24:44.861
I don't know their last names.

24:46.630 --> 24:51.201
But Mike's... Hannah's boyfriend.

24:51.235 --> 24:53.503
Boyfriend or pimp?

24:53.537 --> 24:59.442
Don't tell me. I mean, he's holding her.

24:59.477 --> 25:03.847
Running her?

25:03.881 --> 25:05.415
Does he hurt her?

25:05.449 --> 25:09.052
Mike doesn't hurt her, he...

25:11.055 --> 25:13.523
He loves her.

25:13.557 --> 25:15.959
And she loves him.

25:15.993 --> 25:19.896
If she's doing this, it is only...

25:19.930 --> 25:22.766
Because he is.

25:26.904 --> 25:29.572
I believe you.

25:30.274 --> 25:33.443
I believe you.

25:38.115 --> 25:40.550
All right, all Addie knows
is Mike and TT.

25:40.584 --> 25:41.951
She doesn't know their last names,

25:41.986 --> 25:43.553
never been to their apartments, nothing.

25:43.587 --> 25:45.054
TT's got a bunch of tattoos.

25:45.089 --> 25:47.056
Mike sounds like he's from Chicago.

25:47.091 --> 25:48.558
All right, well, these are violent men.

25:48.592 --> 25:50.260
Let's assume they live violent lives.

25:50.294 --> 25:53.730
Damn, I got 3,276 Mikes
in this criminal database.

25:53.764 --> 25:56.433
Okay, well, the OCD tech
estimated Mike's height

25:56.467 --> 25:59.335
at 6'1", weight 180. Eye color brown.

25:59.370 --> 26:00.904
- Does that help?
- Nah, not really.

26:00.938 --> 26:02.238
I mean, it trims it down a little bit,

26:02.273 --> 26:03.506
but it's still too wide for me.

26:03.541 --> 26:05.341
Age was estimated 32 to 36.

26:05.376 --> 26:07.977
Hey, the Land Cruiser that
was used in the initial robbery

26:08.012 --> 26:10.180
was stolen from a residential
garage in Blue Island.

26:10.214 --> 26:12.916
The owner says you couldn't
see the garage from the street.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.951
Could be someone local,
talks like Chicago.

26:14.985 --> 26:16.920
Okay, okay. Copy Blue Island,

26:16.954 --> 26:19.923
Now we have 84 with a five mile
parameter around Blue Island.

26:19.957 --> 26:21.758
Guys, we still need
to narrow it down more.

26:21.792 --> 26:24.661
Any crosses with "TT"
in the jail nickname system?

26:24.695 --> 26:26.663
We've got tons of those,
but nothing that run up

26:26.697 --> 26:29.032
- against that 84.
- What about tattoos?

26:29.066 --> 26:30.733
Hold up.

26:31.836 --> 26:33.770
- We got seven.
- Whoa...

26:33.804 --> 26:37.774
Yep, got his ass. Okay...

26:37.808 --> 26:39.809
Look at that,
Trent Tagerty, 33 years old,

26:39.844 --> 26:42.612
tattoos of the T's on his neck.
He did a year with

26:42.646 --> 26:45.882
Mike Sheffield at MCC.
Mike Sheffield was pinched

26:45.916 --> 26:47.717
for armed assault and attempted robbery.

26:47.751 --> 26:49.652
All right, print those pictures.

26:49.687 --> 26:51.154
Get a confirmation from Addie.

26:51.188 --> 26:53.289
Yeah, and neither has
a last known address.

26:53.324 --> 26:55.692
Hannah's ID is everywhere,
the footage of them...

26:55.726 --> 26:56.960
They can't be out on the street.

26:56.994 --> 26:58.461
They'll go to someone they know, trust.

26:58.496 --> 26:59.496
Someone that's helped them before.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.331
Trent Tagerty has a cousin.

27:01.365 --> 27:02.999
Warren, he's 42 years old,

27:03.033 --> 27:04.968
rents an apartment in Canaryville.

27:05.002 --> 27:07.537
He's posted bond for Trent four
times and has an open warrant.

27:07.571 --> 27:10.874
All right, gear up. Let's hit it.

27:10.908 --> 27:12.108
Adam.

27:12.142 --> 27:15.545
Listen, I want you to hang back
and swing by Osha's house.

27:15.579 --> 27:16.846
Wait, seriously,
you want me to go to his house?

27:16.881 --> 27:18.381
Look, just tell him I sent you.

27:18.415 --> 27:20.183
I know him. He's a stand up guy.

27:20.217 --> 27:23.319
Say I'll meet him anywhere he
wants; we'll talk in private.

27:23.354 --> 27:24.654
But it's gotta be now.

27:24.688 --> 27:28.191
Okay? I am done calling his ass.

27:45.543 --> 27:48.077
Go.

28:08.566 --> 28:12.235
Chicago PD!

28:12.269 --> 28:14.737
- Hey, get the girl.
- Hey, don't move!

28:14.772 --> 28:16.439
- Get out the bed, come on.
- Clear!

28:16.473 --> 28:18.541
Get your arms off the bed! Come on!

28:18.576 --> 28:20.410
He ain't here. You just missed him.

28:20.444 --> 28:22.045
Get on the floor!

28:22.079 --> 28:24.647
There's a garage downstairs.
He took my car.

28:24.682 --> 28:26.382
Had to be five minutes ago.

28:26.417 --> 28:30.053
Please, he ain't here.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.924
Where is he?

28:37.661 --> 28:39.395
Get your hands against the wall!

28:39.430 --> 28:42.498
- You heard him. Hit that garage!
- Hurry up! Against the wall!

28:42.533 --> 28:44.934
- You good, Hailey?
- Good.

28:50.274 --> 28:53.710
Ugh!

29:01.318 --> 29:02.819
Where are they?

29:02.853 --> 29:05.054
Where's Mike and Hannah?

29:05.656 --> 29:06.923
Where are they?

29:06.957 --> 29:09.459
It's clear. Hannah's not here.

29:17.828 --> 29:20.179
So, here's what's going to happen.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.311
We recovered a gun
in your cousin's apartment,

29:22.374 --> 29:24.600
matches ballistics
for the first robbery.

29:24.938 --> 29:26.338
Cash in your duffle

29:26.398 --> 29:28.499
has got the same bands
as the currency exchange.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.000
See where I'm going with this?

29:30.035 --> 29:31.435
Psst.

29:31.469 --> 29:33.137
You're starting out six feet under

29:33.171 --> 29:34.271
and we got you dead to rights.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.273
So, anything you tell us,

29:36.308 --> 29:38.275
any way that you help us find them,

29:38.310 --> 29:40.311
it's gonna dig you
a little above ground.

29:40.345 --> 29:42.279
You want me to talk so bad?

29:42.314 --> 29:44.682
Get me a lawyer and get me a deal.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.951
Okay.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.520
So you want a deal, huh?

29:51.189 --> 29:54.859
You want a deal? Okay, so...

29:54.893 --> 29:57.962
The deal is...

29:57.996 --> 30:00.297
You're gonna talk.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.933
You understand?

30:09.107 --> 30:11.675
Ah...

30:17.061 --> 30:19.383
- You understand now?
- Yeah, yeah I do.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.752
- I understand.
- Okay.

30:21.786 --> 30:23.988
Good.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.322
Where are they?

30:25.357 --> 30:26.930
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

30:26.966 --> 30:28.657
I don't know where they went.

30:32.304 --> 30:33.797
Come on.

30:34.532 --> 30:36.400
Where did you last see them?

30:36.434 --> 30:37.701
Running like hell down 30th street.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.103
- Uh-huh.
- I don't know where

30:39.137 --> 30:40.938
they were going, I swear.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.340
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.175
Two robberies, split three ways.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.677
That was the plan. It was easy.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.112
And then Mike just starts shooting

30:48.146 --> 30:50.447
and there's the footage
all over the news.

30:50.482 --> 30:53.350
Hannah's picture...
I knew we had to get out.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.853
I tried to convince her to come with me.

30:55.887 --> 30:58.555
And she wouldn't leave him.
She thinks that's love.

31:04.763 --> 31:05.796
Hey.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.631
Thanks. You swing by?

31:07.666 --> 31:10.668
He waved me off.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.605
- You told him I sent you?
- I did.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.709
He told me that
you're wasting your time.

31:18.743 --> 31:21.378
And that he can't help you
get in front of something

31:21.413 --> 31:24.415
that you're already in the middle of.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.066
Then this Mike, he's quite a guy.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.168
He spent more of his life
inside institutions

31:44.202 --> 31:45.402
then out of them.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.403
He's got a few family members

31:46.438 --> 31:47.571
still in Chicago.

31:47.605 --> 31:48.939
I ran them through Lexus Nexus.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.307
He's got about seven addresses

31:50.342 --> 31:51.809
he could be hiding out at.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.577
Got teams en route, Sarge.

31:53.611 --> 31:57.247
Transport teams posted up too...
Midway, Greyhound, O'Hare.

31:57.282 --> 31:58.916
They try to leave the city,
we'll know about it.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.584
Trent said they were on foot,

32:00.618 --> 32:02.419
so they're gonna get spotted eventually.

32:02.454 --> 32:05.456
They'll trip up.

32:11.129 --> 32:15.099
Well, how about we find them
before they do, hmm?

32:15.133 --> 32:17.334
- I was just speaking to...
- A possibility that

32:17.369 --> 32:19.136
we're gonna prevent.

32:19.170 --> 32:20.804
Okay?

32:20.839 --> 32:23.440
We're gonna find them first,
so we're on the scene first,

32:23.475 --> 32:26.477
and we're gonna bring them in quiet.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.812
Chances are, Hannah's gonna be armed.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.114
She held a gun before.

32:30.148 --> 32:33.117
This might not be a quiet arrest.

32:33.151 --> 32:36.186
Look, I know you feel guilty
because you gave her your card.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.129
I didn't give her my card.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.498
My wife did.

32:57.175 --> 33:01.412
So let's hit every address
they could run to.

33:01.446 --> 33:04.982
Try every hotel, pay by night, hostel.

33:05.016 --> 33:07.051
They haven't had time to run far.

33:07.085 --> 33:09.486
Let's find them.

33:09.521 --> 33:12.956
You going where I think you're going?

33:18.763 --> 33:21.331
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, you cannot go in there.

33:21.366 --> 33:22.699
Sir, sir!

33:22.734 --> 33:23.834
What's the matter with you, Jim?

33:23.868 --> 33:25.169
Hank, what are you doing?

33:25.203 --> 33:26.770
This is not the time to be doing this.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.338
- You ignore my calls.
- You need to walk

33:28.373 --> 33:30.007
- out the door.
- I called and asked for help.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.576
- Hank, you need to leave now.
- You owe me!

33:32.610 --> 33:35.079
No, let him stick around.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.784
He's... we're good.
Hank was just leaving.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.186
Yeah, well, I don't believe that.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.420
But go right ahead.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.522
All of this, he can use in court.

33:45.557 --> 33:48.058
Intimidating a prosecutor.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.761
So, you wanna stay for
the grand jury review?

33:50.795 --> 33:52.596
All right, all right,
we're not doing this.

33:52.630 --> 33:56.033
You wanna tear me down,
Denny, tear me down.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.769
- But you got no stake in Al.
- Oh, I know that.

33:58.803 --> 34:00.704
But Al's had the poor fortune
of having had you

34:00.738 --> 34:02.539
- as his partner.
- Tear me down!

34:02.574 --> 34:04.041
- Enough!
- You want him on the stand?

34:04.075 --> 34:05.943
- Come on, I said enough!
- Come at me!

34:05.977 --> 34:09.545
- Go ahead and confess, Hank.
- Not here.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.547
- Walk away.
- Confess, Hank.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.150
- Hank.
- 27 years on this job

34:14.185 --> 34:17.754
and we both know
that you did not do it clean.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.891
Well, the bullet is
finally coming for you, Hank.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.826
Just has to go through Olinsky first.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.795
No, no, no, no. Come on, Hank, let's go.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.931
Let it go. Let it go.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.578
- Sarge.
- Man, what are you doing here?

34:45.609 --> 34:46.943
Al asked me to check in on you.

34:46.976 --> 34:48.543
You think I need a babysitter?

34:48.579 --> 34:50.955
- Just do your damn job, Adam.
- Boss, I've been trying

34:50.985 --> 34:52.648
to call you but your phone's been off.

34:52.683 --> 34:55.658
Car lot on Jackson recognized
photos from the news.

34:55.810 --> 34:58.955
Male, Hispanic, 30s, and a
teenage female with dark hair.

34:58.989 --> 35:00.703
They came in looking for a car.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.578
Let's go.

35:18.315 --> 35:19.520
Gun!

35:19.545 --> 35:21.143
Cover!

35:26.802 --> 35:29.184
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

35:29.379 --> 35:31.113
Go!

35:41.542 --> 35:43.409
- Jay, you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.824
5021 George, 10-1, 10-1.
Shots fired at the police.

35:45.849 --> 35:48.150
<i>Copy that, 5021 George.</i>

36:03.600 --> 36:06.004
There's no one else inside.
There's two exits,

36:06.067 --> 36:07.367
one in front and one in back.

36:07.401 --> 36:09.302
- Any demands?
- They don't have any.

36:09.337 --> 36:11.275
Now, we have access to the
landline but they won't answer.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.972
Haven't said a word to us.

36:13.007 --> 36:14.407
All right, start a line of communication

36:14.442 --> 36:16.277
at the front.
I'll move up through the back.

36:16.317 --> 36:18.721
- Sarge, they're both armed...
- Start a line of communication

36:18.746 --> 36:20.988
at the front.

36:26.127 --> 36:28.095
Mike Sheffield, this is Antonio Dawson

36:28.129 --> 36:29.963
of the Chicago Police Department.

36:29.998 --> 36:31.598
I'm here to help you.

36:31.633 --> 36:32.899
I just wanna make sure all of us

36:32.934 --> 36:34.968
walk away from this safely.

36:35.003 --> 36:37.404
Everybody gets out of here unharmed.

36:37.438 --> 36:40.474
So that means, I'm the guy on your side.

36:40.508 --> 36:41.908
I'm the guy you talk to.

36:41.943 --> 36:44.077
- I'm going in alone.
- I need to know...

36:44.112 --> 36:46.246
what we're looking at here, Mike.

36:46.281 --> 36:50.284
How do I get you and Hannah out
of here safely?

36:50.985 --> 36:53.754
<i>Mike? You listening, Mike?</i>

36:53.788 --> 36:56.757
<i>Mike?</i>

36:56.791 --> 36:58.325
I'm gonna take care of it.
I'll always take care of it.

36:58.359 --> 37:00.093
It's fine. Do you see a door back there?

37:00.128 --> 37:02.095
- Look, baby, do you see a door?
- I don't see any.

37:02.130 --> 37:03.297
No, okay, that's okay.

37:03.331 --> 37:06.099
All right, they're not coming in.

37:06.134 --> 37:07.934
They're not coming in,
you know why, you know why?

37:07.969 --> 37:09.803
Because we're going out.
We're going to go all out.

37:09.837 --> 37:11.371
All right, I did all of this for us.

37:11.406 --> 37:13.173
All right, I got a plan.
I got a plan, we're gonna...

37:13.207 --> 37:15.008
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You stay away from us

37:15.043 --> 37:16.443
- or I'll shoot your head off!
- Take it easy.

37:16.477 --> 37:18.612
Take it easy!

37:18.646 --> 37:20.981
Take it easy.

37:21.015 --> 37:23.483
Look, you fire one shot,
that door gets busted down

37:23.518 --> 37:28.822
and you are both dead,
so just take it easy.

37:28.856 --> 37:33.460
Hey. Look, take it easy.

37:33.494 --> 37:36.296
Okay?

37:37.899 --> 37:41.168
- Antonio, I'm inside.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

37:44.706 --> 37:46.239
Mike, put your weapon down.

37:46.274 --> 37:48.208
Just put your weapon down,
kick it over here,

37:48.242 --> 37:50.477
and we can have a conversation.

37:50.511 --> 37:53.680
You do that, I can come in
there, we can talk.

37:53.715 --> 37:55.816
Hey, we can figure a way out of this.

37:55.850 --> 37:59.152
Mike, there are
dozens of cops out there.

37:59.187 --> 38:00.821
All the exits are covered.

38:00.855 --> 38:02.356
You can't walk outside armed.

38:02.390 --> 38:04.925
You will be dead before
you hit the ground.

38:04.959 --> 38:06.526
- Okay, listen...
- No, Hannah,

38:06.561 --> 38:08.195
Hannah, listen to me.

38:08.229 --> 38:10.864
Hannah, you came to me
for help... I can still help you.

38:10.898 --> 38:12.332
- I'm gonna help you.
- Look, I'm sorry

38:12.367 --> 38:15.402
I wasn't there for you
the last few years.

38:15.436 --> 38:17.270
And I know Mike was.

38:17.305 --> 38:19.506
Look, I get it.
You don't want to lose him,

38:19.540 --> 38:20.941
I understand.

38:20.975 --> 38:24.111
But he led you wrong, Hannah.
This is not you.

38:24.145 --> 38:26.413
Hannah, you don't have
to go out this way.

38:26.447 --> 38:28.048
- There's still time.
- On three.

38:28.082 --> 38:30.584
No, Mike! Do not take her out of there!

38:30.618 --> 38:32.953
Do not make her go out there!

38:32.987 --> 38:34.454
- No!
- Gun!

38:34.489 --> 38:35.756
Drop your weapon!

38:39.894 --> 38:41.762
- Stand down!
- Move in!

38:41.796 --> 38:45.232
Stand down, stand down!

38:45.266 --> 38:47.033
Police, coming out!

38:47.068 --> 38:49.035
Police, coming out!

38:49.070 --> 38:51.538
Oh, my God.

39:01.582 --> 39:03.417
I'm so sorry.

39:16.130 --> 39:19.900
Camille was Hannah's teacher?

39:19.934 --> 39:22.135
First grade.

39:22.170 --> 39:26.673
Yeah, Camille... Camille loved her.

39:27.165 --> 39:30.962
I mean, she always came home
with stories about her.

39:31.712 --> 39:33.993
How she was "a menace."

39:34.174 --> 39:36.400
"A nightmare."

39:37.952 --> 39:40.574
Camille really looked out for her.

39:45.193 --> 39:47.737
She got sick, I took over.

39:52.467 --> 39:55.660
<i>I checked in on Hannah
every year until...</i>

39:55.777 --> 39:57.574
<i>until Justin died.</i>

40:00.367 --> 40:02.555
<i>I just...</i>

40:05.546 --> 40:07.242
<i>Forgot.</i>

40:13.321 --> 40:16.089
<i>I wasn't there for her.</i>

40:18.192 --> 40:20.775
Someone else was.

40:25.233 --> 40:27.885
You can't save everyone, Hank.
