00:03.742 --> 00:04.134
.

00:04.178 --> 00:05.918
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:05.962 --> 00:07.181
sexually based offenses

00:07.224 --> 00:09.444
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.055
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:12.099 --> 00:13.926
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.970 --> 00:15.319
are members of an elite squad

00:15.363 --> 00:17.539
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.280
These are their stories.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.023
- There's no reason
for you to be scared, honey.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.502
I don't bite.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.547
- Do I look scared?

00:25.590 --> 00:27.897
- You could sit
a little bit closer.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.507
- How's this?

00:34.469 --> 00:35.687
[giggles]

00:35.731 --> 00:38.777
[indistinct chatter]

00:43.260 --> 00:45.088
- Are you ready for some fun,
Daddy?

00:45.132 --> 00:48.526
- Call me Adam, I don't need
the whole Daddy shtick.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.528
- What do you need?

00:50.572 --> 00:52.095
- How 'bout seeing what
you look like

00:52.139 --> 00:53.705
underneath this dress, huh?

00:53.749 --> 00:55.620
- [gasps]
That can be arranged.

00:55.664 --> 00:58.275
- Ooh.
[chuckles]

00:58.319 --> 01:00.756
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

01:03.585 --> 01:05.804
God, you're hot.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.329
- [giggles]

01:08.372 --> 01:10.374
[moans]

01:12.072 --> 01:14.335
- How old are you?

01:14.378 --> 01:17.077
- It's not polite to ask a lady
her age.

01:20.689 --> 01:21.733
- Good morning.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.040
- Is it?
You tell me.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.216
- Considering I've barely
closed my eyes

01:26.260 --> 01:29.176
since Rob Miller got
out of prison.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.481
He's targeting me, Fin.

01:30.525 --> 01:33.223
He wants me to know that
he has all the power.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.095
- Liv, we have a unmarked car
on your block,

01:35.138 --> 01:36.226
one in front of Noah's school.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.532
There's no way he can
get at you.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.099
- There's no way he can
get at me?

01:39.142 --> 01:40.926
He walked right into
that restaurant

01:40.970 --> 01:42.537
and introduced himself to Noah.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.408
I should have shot
the son of a bitch.

01:44.452 --> 01:47.411
- No, not so loud.
Stone is in your office, okay?

01:47.455 --> 01:48.891
I called him in.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.154
- Okay.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.246
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.814
Wish I had better news.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.251
- Please don't tell me
it's worse

02:01.295 --> 02:03.471
than Rob Miller making bail.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.604
- Feds dropped the charges.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.563
- Damn.

02:10.739 --> 02:14.786
- He blackmailed the judge,
he threatened witnesses,

02:14.830 --> 02:16.745
he threatened Nikki Staines.

02:16.788 --> 02:21.184
We have him on tape saying,
"No Nikki, no case."

02:21.228 --> 02:23.273
- A federal judge ruled
that statement didn't rise

02:23.317 --> 02:24.448
to the legal standard.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.537
- What now?
- What about Nikki's rape?

02:26.581 --> 02:28.539
- There's nothing there.
Nikki's scared.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.498
She's claiming it
was consensual.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.678
- I'll talk to her.

02:41.465 --> 02:45.295
- Oh, my baby.
It's gonna be okay.

02:45.339 --> 02:48.994
Why don't you go to your room
and lie down?

02:49.038 --> 02:51.910
- What kind of person...?

02:53.869 --> 02:54.957
- What?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.177
- Miller killed
my daughter's dog.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.398
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.139
This is Penny's ashes
right there.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.315
The vet said that
it was rat poison.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.013
Now, the landlord didn't
put down any rat poison,

03:08.057 --> 03:10.842
and I sure didn't put down
any rat poison.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.017
- So how?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.323
- My daughter said that
there's this woman

03:13.367 --> 03:16.500
that offered Penny a treat
on their walk last night,

03:16.544 --> 03:19.155
and she thought it was okay,
right?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.070
And then this morning,
the dog was--

03:21.113 --> 03:22.071
[gasps]

03:22.114 --> 03:26.380
- Oh, Nikki, I'm so sorry.

03:26.423 --> 03:30.079
- Listen, the woman said,

03:30.122 --> 03:32.864
"Say hello to your mom."

03:32.908 --> 03:34.126
Why?

03:34.170 --> 03:36.912
Rob Miller knows that
I wasn't gonna testify.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.871
- So that's why I'm here.

03:42.047 --> 03:46.051
We need you to testify, Nikki.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.052
Listen to me.

03:47.096 --> 03:51.013
The Feds dropped the charges.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.015
- No.

03:53.058 --> 03:55.104
No, no, no, no.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.323
Absolutely not.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.324
- Okay, Nikki,
just hear me out.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.368
Hear me--
- No!

03:58.412 --> 04:00.457
- Just hear me out.
I understand.

04:00.501 --> 04:03.068
So talk to me about
the Wally Stevens case,

04:03.112 --> 04:04.679
the underage girls.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.421
Miller obviously thought that
he'd be implicated,

04:07.464 --> 04:09.118
and that's why he stole
your phone.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.250
- For nothing!

04:10.293 --> 04:12.904
There is not a word
on that phone

04:12.948 --> 04:14.036
that connects him to the case.

04:14.079 --> 04:17.300
- So why?
What was he afraid of?

04:17.344 --> 04:20.347
Can Wally put him
at those sex parties?

04:22.044 --> 04:24.176
- Tell me, what did he--
- I can't!

04:24.220 --> 04:26.396
Attorney-client privilege,
right?

04:26.440 --> 04:27.789
Ever heard of it?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.792
I'm not about to risk
getting myself disbarred.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.971
Listen, I am incredibly
appreciative of what

04:36.014 --> 04:39.496
you've done for me, Olivia,
but you gotta go now.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.284
Go now.

04:51.378 --> 04:54.163
- There has to be a way
to tie Rob Miller

04:54.206 --> 04:57.384
to Wally Stevens
to the sex parties.

04:57.427 --> 05:01.431
He blackmailed a judge,
he stole Nikki Staines' phone;

05:01.475 --> 05:02.476
has to be connected.

05:02.519 --> 05:03.912
What are we missing?

05:03.955 --> 05:06.958
- We've gone over the case
forwards and backwards.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.482
It's fallen apart.
- No.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.614
- The three 16-year-olds that
we put at the party are

05:10.658 --> 05:11.789
all backing off their story.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.313
They're claiming that
nothing happened.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.098
- Right, because he got to them
or got to their parents.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.013
Check the bank accounts.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.581
- This guy doesn't leave
a fingerprint on the knife.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.801
- Fin, we have
half a dozen witnesses...

05:23.845 --> 05:26.151
- We had witnesses.
They all lawyered up.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.805
- Exactly!
That's my point.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.025
- Judge Leonard retired
to the Maldives.

05:30.068 --> 05:33.420
This Wally Stevens guy's
untouchable, Double Jeopardy.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.204
- I know, Fin.
I was there, thank you.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.510
[phone buzzes]

05:37.641 --> 05:39.861
- Lieu, listen,
I hear you on all of this,

05:39.904 --> 05:41.689
but we got something from
the Harbor Unit

05:41.732 --> 05:43.430
that we have to deal with
right now.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.083
A young female washed up
at a pier

05:45.127 --> 05:46.302
on the Hudson River.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.738
- Let's go.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.570
- Can't be more than 15, 16;
naked, no ID.

05:53.614 --> 05:54.876
- How long was she
in the water?

05:54.919 --> 05:56.573
- My guess, a couple of hours,
day at the most.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.358
The ME can give you
a more accurate time frame.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.707
- Did she fall off a boat?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.056
- Looks like every bone
in her body is broken.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.580
Her organs are liquefied.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.679
This girl fell out of the sky.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.863
[dramatic music]

06:25.907 --> 06:32.914
â™ª

07:08.776 --> 07:11.866
- I just wanted to let you know
that a uniformed officer will

07:11.909 --> 07:14.216
be with the sitter when
she picks Noah up

07:14.259 --> 07:15.522
from school today.

07:15.565 --> 07:16.610
Great.
Thank you so much.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.482
I appreciate it.
- How is Noah doing?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.136
- He's thrilled.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.746
He gets to ride
to and from school

07:22.790 --> 07:25.880
in a squad car,
but the school administration,

07:25.923 --> 07:27.229
not so much.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.665
- Miller's a bad guy,
but do you really think

07:28.709 --> 07:30.275
that he would go after
a Lieutenant's kid?

07:30.319 --> 07:33.670
- Rollins, I don't know what
he's capable of.

07:33.714 --> 07:37.326
- The prelim report
from the ME on our Jane Doe.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.588
No water in her lungs,

07:38.632 --> 07:40.329
so she was dead
before she hit the river.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.896
- So cause of death?
- OD.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.289
China White,
highly-concentrated fentanyl.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.769
This girl wasn't an addict.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.119
There's no trace in her hair
or nails, no needle marks.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.599
- So she was given a hot shot.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.079
- The ME's ruling it
undetermined for now,

07:51.122 --> 07:52.689
but they also found
the presence of semen

07:52.733 --> 07:54.299
from two different men.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.953
No DNA hits.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.173
- And there's no matches
with Missing Persons?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.609
- Not yet.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.525
- This girl is healthy,
she has expensive dental work,

08:02.569 --> 08:03.657
she had parents.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.310
I mean, they have to be
looking for her.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.616
- Well, it's only been
24 hours.

08:06.660 --> 08:07.878
We'll keep checking.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.489
- The ME just finished
the autopsy.

08:09.532 --> 08:12.709
- Go.
Go.

08:12.753 --> 08:13.797
- From the condition
of the body,

08:13.841 --> 08:15.712
I'd say she fell at least
2,000 feet.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.584
- All right, so small plane,
maybe a helicopter.

08:17.627 --> 08:18.759
- That's your department.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.543
I can tell you that
she was in the water

08:20.587 --> 08:22.589
less than 15 hours
before she washed ashore.

08:22.632 --> 08:23.633
- All right, great.

08:23.677 --> 08:24.808
So we get a grid
of the tidal pattern

08:24.852 --> 08:26.070
from the Coast Guard,
we find out where

08:26.114 --> 08:27.594
she hit the water,
we cross reference that

08:27.637 --> 08:29.247
with the FAA for aircraft
in that area--

08:29.291 --> 08:32.163
- So we know where,
when, how...

08:32.207 --> 08:33.382
we still don't know who.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.818
- Just getting to that.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.299
At first, I was at a loss
for this little mermaid.

08:37.342 --> 08:41.564
No tattoos, breast implants,
but then I found these.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.827
- What is that, a contact lens?

08:43.871 --> 08:45.046
- Two of them.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.438
It's a miracle
they stayed on the eyeball

08:46.482 --> 08:47.701
through the fall.

08:47.744 --> 08:48.832
- Right, so we can contact
the manufacturer,

08:48.876 --> 08:50.007
but the phrase
"needle in a haystack"

08:50.051 --> 08:50.791
comes to mind.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.357
- If you let me finish...

08:52.401 --> 08:54.272
these lenses have
a unique prescription.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.144
The left eye corrects
20/40.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.841
The right, 20/400.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.539
That kind of difference
in visual acuity

08:59.582 --> 09:01.541
from eye to eye is
one in a million.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.327
Narrow it down enough for you?

09:05.370 --> 09:06.763
- Hmm.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.163
- [exhales deeply]

09:16.207 --> 09:17.644
Hey.
- Hey.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.471
Lindsay Parker, 16.

09:19.515 --> 09:22.692
Her ophthalmologist confirmed
the contacts lens prescription.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.346
She lived here
with her parents,

09:24.389 --> 09:25.913
Vanessa and Hugo Parker.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.567
- And they didn't file
a Missing Persons report

09:27.610 --> 09:29.307
for a 16-year-old girl.
- Well, she's 16.

09:29.351 --> 09:30.700
These days,
that's pretty independent.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.137
I mean, who knows if they even
realize she's missing.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.270
- Yeah, this never gets easier,
does it?

09:35.313 --> 09:36.924
- No.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.275
- Yes?

09:40.318 --> 09:41.842
- I'm Lieutenant Benson,
this is Detective Rollins.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.321
We're from
the Special Victims Unit.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.759
- So you found her?
Please tell me you found her.

09:45.802 --> 09:49.240
- Can we come in?
- Of course.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.808
Vanessa, it's the police.

09:54.637 --> 09:58.119
- Where's Lindsay?
Where's my baby?

09:58.162 --> 10:01.688
- Lieutenant, Detective.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.433
- What are you doing here?

10:08.477 --> 10:10.087
- I'm just here to help,
Lieutenant.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.480
I can assure you.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.700
- Rob's been our family
attorney for ten years.

10:13.743 --> 10:16.833
When Lindsay didn't come home,
he was my first call.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.713
- We need to speak with you
about Lindsay.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.505
- Lindsay was spending
the weekend

10:36.548 --> 10:38.289
at her friend Brooke's house
in Sag Harbor.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.814
- When she didn't answer
her phone, we called the house.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.207
The parents told us
their daughter told them

10:43.251 --> 10:44.339
that she was with us.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.515
- Okay, we're gonna need
their contact.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.386
- Oh, of course.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.651
- We didn't call the police.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.131
They're teenage girls
and Lindsay's been

10:54.175 --> 10:56.090
to parties before
and come home late.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.309
And we just--we didn't wanna
embarrass her.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.356
- So we called Rob to hire
a private detective

11:01.399 --> 11:03.488
if it came to that.

11:03.532 --> 11:07.492
- So, Mr. and Mrs. Parker...

11:07.536 --> 11:09.973
we are so very sorry.

11:10.017 --> 11:13.281
- Wait, Lindsay's all right,
isn't she?

11:14.630 --> 11:17.372
- No.
- I'm sorry.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.683
- Is this your daughter?

11:24.553 --> 11:26.250
- Oh, my God.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.819
Yes, wha--what...?

11:29.863 --> 11:33.127
- No.
No, that's not Lindsay.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.346
- I mean, that's not--
- That's not Lindsay.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.349
- What happened?
Was this some kind of accident?

11:38.393 --> 11:40.700
- We're still investigating.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.093
- We wanna find out
what happened to Lindsay,

11:43.137 --> 11:45.443
so we're gonna need
her phone records,

11:45.487 --> 11:46.880
access to her social media...

11:46.923 --> 11:49.099
- I can get you all of that.
- Okay.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.843
- Again, we're so very sorry.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.716
If there's anything that
we can do to help you--

11:56.759 --> 12:00.023
- Her body....what are we
supposed to do?

12:00.067 --> 12:01.633
Where is she?
- [whimpers]

12:01.677 --> 12:03.374
- We'll help you make
arrangements.

12:03.418 --> 12:04.506
- Yeah.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.290
So, we'll give you some time,

12:06.334 --> 12:09.903
and we'll be in touch.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.993
If you have any questions,
feel free.

12:14.690 --> 12:18.563
- [sobbing]

12:18.607 --> 12:20.740
- I can show you out.

12:21.566 --> 12:25.179
- [wailing]

12:25.222 --> 12:28.748
- Anything the police need,
obviously, I'm here to help.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.358
- You know what?
I'm gonna meet you outside.

12:30.401 --> 12:31.533
- You sure?
- Yep.

12:31.576 --> 12:34.101
I'm good, Amanda.
- I'll be out front.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.150
- I realize this is awkward.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.805
- I don't even know where
to begin with you.

12:42.849 --> 12:46.287
Do your clients know that
you're a criminal?

12:47.288 --> 12:49.507
- They're aware that
I was falsely charged.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.901
Their daughter is dead;
shouldn't that be our priority?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.904
- Well, that's my top priority,
believe me.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.820
But what is your role
in all of this?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
- Excuse me?

12:59.822 --> 13:02.085
- Well,
their 16-year-old daughter

13:02.129 --> 13:05.959
was murdered one week
after you are released

13:06.002 --> 13:07.308
from federal custody.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.526
- Do you hear yourself?

13:08.570 --> 13:09.919
This is just a tragic
coincidence.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.399
- I don't believe
in coincidences.

13:11.442 --> 13:14.315
- What you're saying right now
is clear evidence

13:14.358 --> 13:16.796
of police bias, your bias.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.189
- Okay.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.018
- Are you angry because
I figured out

13:22.062 --> 13:25.456
your little CSU ruse at the bar
two months ago?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.154
- [sighs]

13:27.197 --> 13:29.286
Yeah, I'm angry.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.680
I'm very angry,
but not because of that.

13:31.723 --> 13:37.164
- Or maybe because I declined
to pursue our relationship.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.170
- Don't flatter yourself.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.650
If there weren't
two grieving parents

13:45.694 --> 13:49.132
in the next room,
I'd break your jaw.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.655
- You'd regret that,
Lieutenant.

13:50.699 --> 13:54.529
- Stay away from me.
Stay away from my son.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.227
Because if you don't,
I promise you,

13:57.271 --> 14:00.491
I will do something that
we both regret.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.537
- Okay.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.064
[scoffs]

14:14.201 --> 14:14.418
.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.159
- We don't wanna get you
in trouble, Brooke,

14:16.203 --> 14:17.857
but your friend is dead.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.338
- I know.
I can't believe it.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.906
- Okay, when's the last time
you saw Lindsay?

14:25.255 --> 14:27.344
- We were at this party.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.304
- Where?
- Uh, somewhere in the city.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.567
We took a car service
from Sag Harbor.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.396
Lindsay had the address.
I was pretty wasted.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.267
- What happened at this party?

14:38.442 --> 14:40.053
- I don't wanna tell you.

14:40.096 --> 14:43.056
- Brooke, I'm sorry,
but you have to.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.406
- [sniffles]
I'm scared.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.147
- Honey, I know you're scared.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.192
Listen, none of this
is your fault, okay?

14:49.236 --> 14:51.891
We just need to figure out
what happened to Lindsay.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.547
- This wasn't a party with
your friends, was it, Brooke?

14:58.636 --> 14:59.942
It's okay.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.292
But you need to tell us
the truth.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.993
- There were men there.
- Mm-hmm.

15:07.036 --> 15:09.517
- Lindsay and I, uh...

15:09.560 --> 15:12.955
sometimes they treated us
like adults.

15:12.999 --> 15:16.611
You know, champagne, coke...

15:16.654 --> 15:19.092
It was exciting.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.572
One guy even gave me
a Birkin bag.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.230
Please don't tell my parents.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.452
- Lindsay's cell phone
went dead

15:31.495 --> 15:33.715
at 2:36 a.m. Sunday morning.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.151
- Where?

15:35.195 --> 15:36.718
- The signal was picked up
by a cell tower in Tribeca.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.720
We can pinpoint
a five-block radius.

15:38.763 --> 15:41.288
- So run every single building
in the zone.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.463
- I'm already on it.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.552
I'm checking car services
that made trips

15:44.595 --> 15:47.033
from Sag Harbor to Manhattan
that night.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.209
- Okay, so,
this may be a long shot,

15:49.252 --> 15:52.038
but I want you to show
this girl a picture

15:52.081 --> 15:54.692
of Wally Stevens
and everyone else that

15:54.736 --> 15:56.781
we've picked up
at an underage sex party

15:56.825 --> 15:58.000
in the last six months.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.523
There has to be a connection,

15:59.567 --> 16:02.396
and Rob Miller is
at the center of it.

16:04.267 --> 16:08.837
- And just let us know
if you recognize anybody.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.230
- [grunts]
No.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.580
No.
Oh, that's Wally.

16:12.623 --> 16:15.235
We met at The Maidstone.
He was really nice.

16:15.278 --> 16:18.020
- Did he invite you
to the party?

16:18.064 --> 16:20.240
- Yes.
- Okay.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.111
Anybody else?

16:22.155 --> 16:25.114
- No.
No.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.726
[gasps]
Mm-mm.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.774
- Are you sure about that?

16:32.817 --> 16:36.299
- I don't know.
I guess he looks familiar.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.955
- From the party?

16:39.999 --> 16:43.654
- No, maybe I saw him on TV.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.179
- Okay.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.876
Anybody else?

16:49.095 --> 16:50.705
- Wait, go back.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.100
I know him.
- How do you know him?

16:54.143 --> 16:56.841
- He was at a party
in the Hamptons last September.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.278
He was with this girl,

16:58.321 --> 17:00.628
an Italian foreign exchange
student.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
- Do you know her?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.205
- Brooke.
She was adorable.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.076
- You're not helping yourself
here, Alex.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.557
- I didn't have sex with her.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.472
- What about this girl?

17:18.515 --> 17:19.995
- She looks familiar.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.518
- Familiar, how?

17:22.432 --> 17:24.173
Did you see these two girls
go to a party

17:24.217 --> 17:25.653
in the Hamptons last September?

17:25.696 --> 17:28.047
- Are you kidding me,
almost a year ago?

17:28.090 --> 17:29.135
- Tell them what you know,
Alex,

17:29.178 --> 17:31.006
if you wanna get out by 70.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.660
- Fine, I recognize them,

17:32.703 --> 17:34.314
but I didn't have sex
with either of them.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.315
I swear.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.968
- Did he?

17:41.538 --> 17:43.671
- I--I don't know who that is.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.021
- The way you're twitching,
pal, I don't believe you.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.370
- Is there a question here?

17:47.414 --> 17:51.331
- Yeah.
Does he know her?

17:51.374 --> 17:53.246
- I can't say.

17:53.289 --> 17:57.380
- Well, you should know
she's dead.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.469
- I had nothing to do
with that.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.123
- I think you should listen
to your lawyer

18:01.167 --> 18:02.124
and tell us what you know.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.517
You wanna get out of here
by 70,

18:03.560 --> 18:05.084
you'll still have
a little life left;

18:05.127 --> 18:07.042
90, not so much.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.523
- If you saw this guy
with this pants down,

18:09.566 --> 18:12.308
if you saw him within five feet
of these two girls,

18:12.352 --> 18:14.354
if you saw him so much
as light up a cigarette

18:14.397 --> 18:16.747
in a no smoking area,
then we can work with you.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.489
But you have gotta tell us
how you know him.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.144
- Okay.
[exhales deeply]

18:23.580 --> 18:24.929
Okay.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.978
Maybe I saw him at that party
in the Hamptons.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.764
But I am not testifying
against Rob Miller.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.420
I'll take my chances inside.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.122
[indistinct chatter]

18:50.216 --> 18:51.217
- Hey, Jim.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.348
- You looking for Noah,
Ms. Benson?

18:52.392 --> 18:53.480
- Yeah, where is he?

18:53.523 --> 18:55.438
- There must be some mix up.
- What?

18:55.482 --> 18:57.875
- He got checked off
for early pickup.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.094
- Not by me.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.182
- How could you not know?

19:00.226 --> 19:01.531
Two uniformed officers said
that

19:01.575 --> 19:02.576
they had authorization for--

19:02.619 --> 19:04.143
- No, I didn't send them.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.146
- Signed off, Lieutenant
Olivia Benson right there.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.975
- That wasn't me.
- Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.412
[phone beeps]

19:12.455 --> 19:16.111
- [shaky breathing]

19:16.155 --> 19:17.547
Amanda.
- Yeah, Liv.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.636
- Amanda, I need you
to put out an all-city alert.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.203
Somebody's taken Noah.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.032
- No.
No, Noah's here.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.164
I've got him.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.730
Two unis from the 21st
dropped him off.

19:26.774 --> 19:27.992
They said you asked
for a pickup.

19:28.036 --> 19:33.041
- No, I didn't, Amanda.
It was Rob Miller.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.391
It had to be.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.699
He...he's sending me a message,
Amanda.

19:38.742 --> 19:41.310
He's sending me a message
that he can take my son

19:41.354 --> 19:43.486
whenever he wants.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.445
Just don't let him out
of your eyesight, okay?

19:45.488 --> 19:46.620
- Okay.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.622
Liv, it's all right.
I've got him.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.667
Okay?
He's safe.

19:51.494 --> 19:52.930
[phone beeps]

20:02.026 --> 20:04.420
- [breathing heavy]

20:04.464 --> 20:06.857
You son of a bitch.

20:07.902 --> 20:10.644
- Take it easy.
Noah's fine.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.211
- Stay away from my son.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.647
- Or what, you'll shoot me?

20:13.690 --> 20:16.563
Take my advice,
make life easier on yourself.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.173
Drop this case.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.697
- Go to hell.

20:28.444 --> 20:28.662
.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.707
- So Rob Miller
and Wally Stevens.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.492
Rob Miller stole
Nikki Staines' phone,

20:32.535 --> 20:35.016
because he was scared
that Stevens would

20:35.059 --> 20:37.018
implicate him
in the underage sex case.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.324
- There was nothing
on the phone.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.239
- The charges against Stevens
were dropped,

20:40.282 --> 20:41.283
but that's how we know that

20:41.327 --> 20:42.806
Rob Miller got
to Judge Leonard.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.635
- Which we also can't prove.
What about the girls?

20:45.679 --> 20:46.854
- Well, okay.

20:46.897 --> 20:50.031
So, Brooke Davis was
with Lindsay Parker

20:50.074 --> 20:51.032
the night she was killed.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.816
Brooke ID'd Alex Kay,

20:52.860 --> 20:56.167
who put Miller at a sex party
last September in the Hamptons,

20:56.211 --> 20:58.735
but now refuses to testify
against Miller.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.695
- So here's my working theory.

21:01.738 --> 21:05.176
Rob Miller runs into Lindsay,

21:05.220 --> 21:08.049
who just happens to be
his clients' daughter,

21:08.092 --> 21:10.225
at a party Saturday night.

21:10.269 --> 21:14.795
Miller panics because he thinks
that Lindsay can ID him.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.493
He gives her a hot shot.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.540
Okay, I know that
there are definitely a lot

21:20.583 --> 21:22.019
of dots to connect--

21:22.063 --> 21:25.371
- I'd say that's
an understatement, Lieutenant.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.765
- He's a man,
not a supervillain.

21:28.809 --> 21:32.029
He had to have made a mistake.

21:32.073 --> 21:34.554
- If he did, I don't see it.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.127
- My office, Counselor.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.094
Whose side are you on?

21:53.137 --> 21:54.748
- Not Rob Miller's.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.445
- Doesn't look that way.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.795
- You're accusing me
of something.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.449
- I'm just asking.

22:06.977 --> 22:09.153
I know that
Rob Miller is guilty.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.764
- How?
- How?

22:10.807 --> 22:13.941
Because he had unis pick up
my son from his school.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.682
He was clearly threatening me.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.119
He looked me in the eye
and he told me

22:18.162 --> 22:21.122
to drop the case.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.558
- When were you gonna
tell me this?

22:22.602 --> 22:25.692
- That's irrelevant
to the investigation.

22:26.736 --> 22:30.131
- Olivia, it is completely
relevant to the investigation.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.568
He's threatening Noah.

22:32.612 --> 22:35.441
Anything you find out,
his lawyer will claim you have

22:35.484 --> 22:37.834
a personal vendetta
against him.

22:43.231 --> 22:47.278
- Peter, I'm worried that
he's going to hurt my son.

22:54.198 --> 22:58.507
Rob Miller is a criminal,
Peter.

22:58.551 --> 23:03.164
He's a rapist,
he's a murderer...

23:03.207 --> 23:04.731
and we got nothing.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.345
And he's gonna get away
with all of this.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.099
- Hey.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.317
- Oh.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.971
- Thanks for meeting me.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.062
- Look, I am only here
because you swore

23:32.106 --> 23:33.716
you wouldn't ask me
to testify.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.935
- I'm not.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.676
- So, what do you want?

23:36.719 --> 23:41.028
- Same thing you want,
Rob Miller behind bars.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.508
- How the hell are we gonna
do that?

23:42.551 --> 23:45.424
- We're gonna break
a couple of rules.

24:23.113 --> 24:26.639
- Brooke, you can come on in.
Just leave your stuff there.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.947
Have a seat on the couch.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.236
- You got a judge to sign off
on an arrest warrant.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.934
- I did.
- With what evidence?

25:00.977 --> 25:02.501
- Just trust me.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.242
- Do I have a choice?

25:05.286 --> 25:07.288
- Parkers are here.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.943
- With their lawyer?
- Yeah.

25:12.598 --> 25:15.470
- Mr. and Mrs. Parker.
- You have a break in the case?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.777
- Yes, we have a suspect
in your daughter's murder.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.301
- Who?
- Actually, it's your lawyer.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.347
- What?
- Rob Miller.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.349
You're under arrest

25:25.393 --> 25:27.700
for the murder
of Lindsay Parker.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.789
[handcuffs click]

25:29.832 --> 25:30.877
Get him out of here.

25:41.365 --> 25:41.540
.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.498
- So you're just gonna
keep me in the dark?

25:43.542 --> 25:44.934
- Well, the fisherman shouldn't

25:44.978 --> 25:46.196
worry about what the chef
is gonna do with his catch.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.111
- I love metaphors, Peter,
but not so much

25:48.155 --> 25:51.680
when it involves
a rapist/murderer's

25:51.724 --> 25:52.899
day in court.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.162
And even less when
the State's case is--

25:55.205 --> 25:56.903
- Circumstantial?

25:56.946 --> 25:59.732
- Only circumstantial.

25:59.775 --> 26:03.736
For all I know, all we have is
a bunch of arrows

26:03.779 --> 26:06.739
on a corkboard signifying
a whole lot of nothing.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.655
- Do you think Rob Miller raped
Nikki Staines?

26:09.698 --> 26:10.917
- Of course.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.440
- Do you think he murdered
Lindsay Parker?

26:12.483 --> 26:14.703
- You know that I do.
- Good.

26:14.747 --> 26:18.098
You caught the fish,
now let me cook it.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.797
- [sighs]

26:24.974 --> 26:26.933
- At first we thought
it was weird,

26:26.976 --> 26:29.457
you know,
partying with old guys, but...

26:29.500 --> 26:30.893
- But?

26:31.894 --> 26:33.679
- I mean, we could hook up
with guys from our school,

26:33.722 --> 26:35.071
but they don't...

26:35.115 --> 26:36.595
- They don't give you
Birkin bags?

26:36.638 --> 26:39.467
- I mean, it's not like
we were whores or anything.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.903
- No, no, of course not.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.602
You were 16-year-old girls
who were taken advantage of

26:43.645 --> 26:44.820
by rich, horny old men.

26:44.864 --> 26:46.430
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.431
And tell me, Miss Davis,

26:47.475 --> 26:49.912
was one of these men
the defendant?

26:52.698 --> 26:54.525
- I'm not sure.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.789
I've never seen
his face before.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.225
- So it's just
a coincidence that

26:58.268 --> 27:01.184
you and Mr. Miller ate lunch
at BLT Steakhouse?

27:01.228 --> 27:02.925
- I've never been to the BLT.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.667
- That's odd...

27:05.711 --> 27:08.670
because your phone was.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.889
[remote clicks]

27:09.932 --> 27:11.804
These are GPS records
from two cell phones.

27:11.847 --> 27:14.328
Do you recognize
the 631 number?

27:14.371 --> 27:16.199
- Yes, that's my number.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.767
- Where was your phone located
on Tuesday, May 13th

27:18.811 --> 27:21.640
between 1:17 p.m.
and 2:34 p.m.?

27:21.683 --> 27:24.730
- 106 East 57th Street.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.297
- The same place
during the same time

27:27.341 --> 27:29.822
as the 914 number.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.214
- That's what it looks like.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.346
- Good.

27:32.389 --> 27:33.695
In case you're wondering,

27:33.739 --> 27:37.003
that number belongs
to the defendant, Rob Miller.

27:37.046 --> 27:40.528
And the location
is BLT Steakhouse.

27:40.571 --> 27:43.139
The exact one,
the same place that

27:43.183 --> 27:45.011
you swore you'd never
eaten at before.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.926
Now tell me, at that lunch,

27:46.969 --> 27:48.710
did Mr. Miller give you
any money?

27:48.754 --> 27:49.842
- No, I told you.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.365
I've never been
to that restaurant.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.802
- This is nonsense.
- Sit, Mr. Miller.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.325
- Be that as it may,

27:55.369 --> 27:58.633
has Mr. Miller ever given you
any cash?

27:58.677 --> 27:59.634
- No.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.505
Miss Davis...

28:03.769 --> 28:05.596
do you recognize this document?

28:07.337 --> 28:08.904
- Yes,
that's my bank statement.

28:08.948 --> 28:12.255
- Direct your attention
to transaction on May 13th.

28:13.648 --> 28:14.997
- That's impossible.

28:15.041 --> 28:19.785
- What happened at 3:40 p.m.
on the 13th, Miss Davis?

28:19.828 --> 28:21.743
- There was a deposit
for $9,500,

28:21.787 --> 28:23.484
but I've never had
that much cash.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.746
I didn't make that deposit.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.226
- So you didn't deposit
the money

28:26.269 --> 28:28.663
on the same day you didn't
have lunch with the defendant?

28:28.707 --> 28:29.925
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.754
You know what it looks like
to me, Miss Davis?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.582
It looks like Mr. Miller
paid you

28:34.625 --> 28:36.062
to un-remember his face.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.629
- Objection.
- Sustained.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.112
- Nothing further.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.770
- Let me ask you something,
Brooke.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.554
Did you ever meet Rob Miller?

28:50.598 --> 28:52.121
- No.

28:52.165 --> 28:55.298
- Did he ever give you $9,500?
- No way.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.389
- Thank you.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.614
- No, he's not a member.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.095
As a matter of fact,
I have no idea who he is,

29:09.138 --> 29:11.924
and I've been working
for the club for 27 years.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.403
- You just let anyone in?

29:13.447 --> 29:15.231
- No, he was looking
for a member,

29:15.275 --> 29:16.885
so I said he could
wait in the lobby.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.800
- Which member was
he looking for?

29:18.844 --> 29:19.845
- Mr. Miller.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.237
- I've never even seen
this guy.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.413
- That's two strikes,
Mr. Miller.

29:24.545 --> 29:25.589
[rewind zips]

29:25.633 --> 29:27.940
- Now that's him, isn't it?
- Yes.

29:27.983 --> 29:31.030
- And that's Mr. Miller's guest
leaving.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.640
Do you notice anything
different about him?

29:32.683 --> 29:35.991
- He came in with an envelope,
he left without one.

29:36.035 --> 29:38.951
- And that was 15 minutes
after Mr. Miller arrived.

29:38.994 --> 29:42.606
- 17, if you look
at the time stamp on the video.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.173
- Huh.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.964
- Mr. Burton,
did you actually see

29:52.007 --> 29:55.271
Mr. Miller greet
his so-called guest?

29:55.315 --> 29:56.272
- No.

29:56.316 --> 30:00.015
- Did you actually see him take

30:00.059 --> 30:02.409
the envelope from his guest?

30:02.452 --> 30:03.758
- No.

30:06.717 --> 30:07.980
- That's Lamar Jackson.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.590
- Have you had occasion
to meet Mr. Jackson?

30:09.633 --> 30:12.767
- Yeah, he's a con.
I arrested him in 2014.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.856
- For what?
- Selling narcotics.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.336
- Have you ever heard
of China White?

30:16.379 --> 30:19.078
- Yeah, that's the street term
for fentanyl.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.210
That's what he was selling
when I busted him.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.128
- Where is Mr. Jackson now?

30:26.172 --> 30:27.956
- I wouldn't know.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.524
- Would it surprise you
if Mr. Stone asked him

30:30.567 --> 30:31.786
to take the stand?

30:31.830 --> 30:34.049
- Nothing surprises me anymore.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.268
- Well,
I'll tell you this much,

30:35.311 --> 30:37.879
it'd surprise me,
because that would mean

30:37.923 --> 30:39.838
Mr. Stone was
suborning perjury.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.014
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

30:42.057 --> 30:44.494
I have no more questions
for the witness, Your Honor.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.889
- The People rest, Your Honor.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.021
- Mr. Biegel?

30:49.064 --> 30:51.545
- The Defense calls
Nikki Staines.

31:04.819 --> 31:04.950
.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.429
- On the afternoon of May 13th,

31:06.473 --> 31:07.474
did you make a visit

31:07.517 --> 31:10.216
to the Commerce Bank
of Manhattan?

31:10.259 --> 31:11.434
- I did.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.088
- You remember how much money
you deposited?

31:13.132 --> 31:16.178
- It was $9,500.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.832
- Into your personal account?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.225
- No.
- No.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.357
Because you don't have
an account at Commerce do you?

31:21.401 --> 31:23.925
- No.
- I didn't think so.

31:23.969 --> 31:27.668
Can you tell me into whose
account you made a deposit?

31:29.365 --> 31:31.063
- It was Brooke Davis' account.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.413
- $9,500.
Whoa.

31:33.456 --> 31:34.588
Feeling generous, were you?

31:34.631 --> 31:36.851
- Objection.
- Sustained.

31:36.895 --> 31:41.160
- Ms. Staines, can you tell me
why you would deposit money

31:41.203 --> 31:44.076
into a complete stranger's
account?

31:49.472 --> 31:51.866
- I was trying to frame
your client.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.000
- Excuse me?

31:55.043 --> 31:58.960
- I was trying to frame
Rob Miller.

32:06.794 --> 32:10.102
- I'm speechless, Ms. Staines.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.930
Speechless.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.859
- Why would you try to frame
the defendant, Ms. Staines?

32:32.689 --> 32:34.082
- Because he threatened me.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.562
- How did he threaten you?

32:35.605 --> 32:38.826
- I was in the middle
of a contested custody battle,

32:38.869 --> 32:42.656
and Rob Miller had compromising
photos of me

32:42.699 --> 32:45.180
that he threatened to turn over
to my ex-husband.

32:45.224 --> 32:49.010
- And you were scared you would
lose custody of your daughter?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.316
- He's evil.

32:50.359 --> 32:52.448
He'll do whatever it takes
to get what he wants

32:52.492 --> 32:54.537
no matter who it hurts.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.104
- Are you still scared of him?

32:57.497 --> 32:59.978
- Um, I don't know.

33:06.506 --> 33:07.855
- She was completely
blacked out.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.465
She doesn't remember anything.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.032
- What if she does?

33:11.076 --> 33:14.296
What if Benson convinces her
to testify?

33:14.340 --> 33:15.776
- It'll be taken care of.

33:15.819 --> 33:18.692
- How?
- No Nikki, no case.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.434
- Do you recognize
those voices, Ms. Staines?

33:21.477 --> 33:23.784
- That was Chief Dodds
and the defendant.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.569
- Which one of them said,
"No Nikki, no case."?

33:26.613 --> 33:29.137
- That was Rob Miller.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.747
- I'll ask again.

33:30.791 --> 33:33.054
Are you still scared?

33:33.098 --> 33:35.361
- He killed Lindsay Parker,
didn't he?

33:35.404 --> 33:36.840
- Objection.

33:36.884 --> 33:39.713
- The jury will disregard
the witness' last statement.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.150
- In fact, you were so scared
of Rob Miller

33:42.194 --> 33:44.196
that you manufactured
circumstantial evidence

33:44.239 --> 33:47.895
in order to trick the jury
into convicting him.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.201
- Yes.

33:49.244 --> 33:52.726
- You were so scared that
you risked your career

33:52.769 --> 33:55.729
and your freedom to put him
in prison.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.948
- I have a daughter.

33:59.211 --> 34:02.823
He would be a threat to me
for the rest of my life

34:02.866 --> 34:05.782
if I didn't do anything.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.698
[sniffles]

34:29.415 --> 34:30.764
- What the hell?

34:34.985 --> 34:36.117
- I shouldn't be talking
to you.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.860
- Oh, I see.
Now you worry about ethics.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.123
Haven't you learned by now
that people

34:42.167 --> 34:45.605
that screw with me typically
don't have happy endings?

34:45.648 --> 34:48.695
Endings I want.
Endings I control.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.392
It's called power, Lieutenant.

34:50.436 --> 34:51.959
- Good night.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.965
- I've got it.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.836
You pissants
don't comprehend it.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.839
You'll see,
when the dust settles,

35:02.883 --> 35:05.146
you, your friend
Nikki Staines...

35:05.190 --> 35:06.278
- You okay, Liv?

35:06.321 --> 35:09.324
- Get this piece of dirt
away from me.

35:10.673 --> 35:12.632
- Do not touch me.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.025
A word to the wise, Lieutenant.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.811
You're a tiny fish.

35:17.854 --> 35:21.989
Tiny fish always get eaten
by the bigger fish.

35:22.032 --> 35:25.906
Like it or not,
it's how the world works.

35:27.995 --> 35:30.345
- Somebody's freaking out.

35:32.521 --> 35:33.696
- You were at the trial?

35:33.740 --> 35:37.178
- No, but I heard Nikki put on
quite a show.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.848
- What, Nikki?
What are you doing?

35:54.891 --> 35:57.285
- Oh, my God, stop it.

35:57.329 --> 36:00.027
What I did, I didn't just do it
for me, you know.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.420
- Whoa.

36:01.463 --> 36:04.031
I would have never agreed
to this.

36:04.074 --> 36:05.728
- That's it--that's why
we didn't say anything to you.

36:05.772 --> 36:08.078
- "We"?
Who's "we"?

36:09.602 --> 36:10.559
Stone knew about this?

36:10.603 --> 36:13.519
- [chuckles]
Christ, Liv.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.173
It was his idea.

36:29.099 --> 36:32.973
- You and Stone tried to frame
Miller?

36:33.016 --> 36:35.280
- Yeah.
He is guilty.

36:35.323 --> 36:38.674
- You could both be disbarred
for this.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.807
- Oh, God.
You know what?

36:40.850 --> 36:42.722
There are things that are
more important

36:42.765 --> 36:45.725
than a license to tap dance
around a courtroom.

36:45.768 --> 36:46.900
- Oh, my God.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.424
- We've been doing this
a long time, Liv.

36:49.468 --> 36:52.775
And we don't say it out loud
or when the lights are on,

36:52.819 --> 36:56.431
but there are times in the dark

36:56.475 --> 37:00.305
when we whisper,
"Sometimes the law's

37:00.348 --> 37:02.089
just not good enough."

37:03.960 --> 37:07.877
And a threat to my child's
safety is one of those times.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.927
At least I won't have to
look over my shoulder

37:13.970 --> 37:15.015
for the rest of my life.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.104
Oh, and guess what.
Neither will you.

37:17.147 --> 37:21.587
- No.
No.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.851
I am not part of this.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.896
- Yeah, you are.

37:44.566 --> 37:47.308
- Have you reached a verdict?

37:47.352 --> 37:48.309
- We have.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.746
- What say you?

37:50.790 --> 37:52.661
- On the sole count
of the indictment,

37:52.705 --> 37:55.011
Murder in the Second Degree,

37:55.055 --> 38:00.016
we find the defendant,
Robert Alan Miller, guilty.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.281
- Wait, what?

38:08.068 --> 38:09.896
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Rob, that can't...

38:09.939 --> 38:11.550
Rob. Rob, hold on a sec.

38:11.593 --> 38:12.725
- Son of a bitch.

38:12.768 --> 38:14.814
You set me up,
you son of a bitch!

38:14.857 --> 38:15.858
You set me up!
[gavel pounds]

38:15.902 --> 38:18.383
- Order!
Order!

38:18.426 --> 38:20.863
[handcuffs click]

38:32.875 --> 38:35.356
- I don't even know what
to say.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.358
Congratulations?

38:37.402 --> 38:39.055
I mean, you won the case

38:39.099 --> 38:41.928
without a single piece
of evidence.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.886
- I proved Miller was
a bad guy,

38:43.930 --> 38:46.193
and the jury put him away
for that alone.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.021
For once the arrow
on the wheel of justice

38:48.064 --> 38:49.022
stopped at the right place.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.850
- Yeah, with a little help.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.287
- Everybody needs
a little help, Liv.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.202
- Even me.

38:55.245 --> 38:56.638
- Actually, you're the one
person who could probably

38:56.682 --> 38:57.726
make it on her own.

38:57.770 --> 38:58.684
- Okay, well,
let's take it easy.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.685
We both know that's not true.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.208
- Yeah, I do,
but that's not what

39:01.251 --> 39:03.558
most people wanna hear, is it?

39:03.602 --> 39:05.430
- Peter.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.042
Thank you.
- Why?

39:09.085 --> 39:11.261
Because I put my integrity
and my career

39:11.305 --> 39:14.482
and everything I believe in
in jeopardy for a good friend?

39:14.526 --> 39:17.224
- Yes.
Yes.

39:17.267 --> 39:21.054
And I didn't ask for this.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.012
- I know you didn't ask for it.
I did it anyway.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.579
I was always gonna do it.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.627
I hope you find someone
like that again.

39:29.758 --> 39:30.759
- What does that mean?

39:30.803 --> 39:33.371
- Look at what I just did
in there.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.939
Now, I don't regret any of it
for a minute, none of it.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.854
I simply lost perspective.
This is on me.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.683
It's a...it's a weakness
and it's a crack

39:41.727 --> 39:42.989
in my character.

39:43.032 --> 39:45.252
But the fact is,
you became more important to me

39:45.295 --> 39:48.124
than the case I was trying
and that is not me, Liv.

39:57.046 --> 39:59.527
You can look at a case
with an open heart.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.662
I can't do that.
I have--no, stop.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.623
I have to look
at a case through clear eyes.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.018
- Hold on, hold on.
- I will risk--

40:12.061 --> 40:15.369
Stop, just listen.
I have to move on.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.633
I have to go or risk
getting blinded again.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.289
- Wait.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.204
- You take care of yourself,
Liv.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.494
