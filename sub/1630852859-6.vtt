00:00.934 --> 00:02.401
<i>[Shauna] Previously
on I Am Shauna Rae...</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:03.936
- [woman] Hi.
- [Shauna] Hi.

00:04.071 --> 00:06.739
<i>This afternoon, I am meeting a
new doctor for a physical exam.</i>

00:06.741 --> 00:09.975
I have migraines, I have
variance of intensity for migraines.

00:09.977 --> 00:12.277
She has the history
of brain cancer,

00:12.279 --> 00:16.148
so it might not always be as
simple as she has migraines.

00:16.150 --> 00:20.052
The cancer coming back, it's
almost more than a possibility.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.955
It just seems
like it's going to happen.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.463
We've never been out, like,
at a club or a bar together.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.836
I can't even see over the bar.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.271
And she didn't seem
to understand.

00:41.742 --> 00:42.974
It just sets me off.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.846
When it comes to me moving
out, it depends on my mom.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.015
- Yeah.
- She's very, very protective of me.

00:50.017 --> 00:54.520
It's a very tricky situation, so when
I tell my parents that I'm moving out,

00:54.522 --> 00:56.455
I don't think
it'll go over well.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.997
Halloween is this weekend

01:05.999 --> 01:09.601
and my family and I have a bunch
of Halloween activities planned,

01:09.603 --> 01:13.705
<i>like costume shopping, and
it'll be a nice, comforting break</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:16.909
from the rowdy weekend
we just had in Pittsburgh.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.778
<i>Tara will be in town for
Halloween this weekend.</i>

01:19.780 --> 01:21.914
<i>I am excited to see Tara again.</i>

01:21.916 --> 01:25.984
<i>I haven't seen Tara for
Halloween in a very long time.</i>

01:25.986 --> 01:29.855
And I know it used to be her
favorite holiday, it's my favorite holiday.

01:29.857 --> 01:34.960
<i>And I don't think what happened
at the club, the argument we had,</i>

01:34.962 --> 01:38.797
will affect us, so [laughs],
it'll be fun.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.233
What kind of costumes
were you last year?

01:41.235 --> 01:43.001
Oh, I don't do
trick or treating.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.770
- I'm 22.
- Okay. You're 22?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.472
- [Shauna] Yeah.
- So, you're...

01:46.474 --> 01:49.074
- So it's been a couple of years.
- [Ronald] But, what a minute.

01:49.076 --> 01:52.778
When she told me she
was 22, I took a double take,

01:52.780 --> 01:55.948
and I said, "Okay,
I'm ready for the challenge."

01:55.950 --> 02:00.185
<i>I wanna help her, I wanna make
sure she laughs and feels good about it.</i>

02:00.187 --> 02:03.255
I'm 63
and I still trick or treat.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.523
Yeah, but I haven't done it.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.991
Okay, why not? Let's do it.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.159
- Oh.
- [Ronald] It's fun.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.961
[Patty] Let's do it.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.333
- I have a Girl Scout. Okay?
- Okay?

02:15.136 --> 02:18.036
I have...
This is a storybook beauty.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.038
Then I have my ladybug,
which I love.

02:20.908 --> 02:24.676
Dressing up for Halloween
is something I dread.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.145
It's something
that's very complicated

02:26.147 --> 02:29.047
because age appropriate
outfits, they don't fit

02:29.049 --> 02:31.783
or they don't look right
or I'm not comfortable.

02:31.785 --> 02:36.021
And then, costumes
that do fit are childlike

02:36.023 --> 02:39.992
and have sparkles and rainbows
and butterflies and all this crap on it.

02:39.994 --> 02:43.028
And I don't wanna get
mistaken for a child.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.631
- You wanna be super beer girl?
- No.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.899
- [laughing]
- [Patty] Sorry [laughs].

02:46.901 --> 02:49.001
It's so funny, I'm asking her
and the echo came out

02:49.003 --> 02:50.936
- on this side of the store.
- I know.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.540
- Okay.
- There were some costumes that were suggested that

02:55.242 --> 02:57.075
I had to nix real quick.

02:57.077 --> 02:57.910
No. Sorry.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.812
- She speaks for me.
- [Ronald] Right?

03:00.814 --> 03:04.516
<i>[Patty] There could've been a
costume that she may have liked,</i>

03:04.518 --> 03:07.186
but I knew that she wasn't
gonna fit in,

03:07.188 --> 03:10.022
so I gotta get rid of it
real fast.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.523
[Mark] The clothes
we're against.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.125
And sometimes,
I'm the bad guy in that.

03:13.127 --> 03:16.495
And I just take that heat because
it's going to be more upsetting

03:17.665 --> 03:18.964
than anything.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.466
[Ronald]
That little cowgirl's cute.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.936
- Oh, I got a little bit of an eye lift on that one.
- [Patty laughs]

03:23.938 --> 03:26.138
Does that mean that's a
sort of yes, kind of liking?

03:26.140 --> 03:32.978
I don't know. I mean,
it's still very, very showy.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.714
<i>When I wear something
age appropriate</i>

03:35.716 --> 03:37.950
<i>or what other people
my age wear,</i>

03:37.952 --> 03:42.020
people tend to stare
and point and whisper.

03:42.022 --> 03:47.593
And it's not easy trying to embrace
yourself and what you wanna wear

03:47.595 --> 03:50.162
<i>when other people
are so judgmental.</i>

03:50.164 --> 03:51.897
[Ronald] Shauna, would you
wear an over the head mask,

03:51.899 --> 03:53.865
so they don't
even know it's you?

03:53.867 --> 03:58.070
I have, you know, aliens, and
I have all these great masks.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.938
So I'm gonna put this
over your head.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.608
- Turn to them and show Mom and Dad.
- [laughing]

04:02.610 --> 04:04.109
I love this because it's scary

04:04.111 --> 04:06.078
and then, with the right
hands, which we have.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.713
[Shauna] Oh, I've gotta
put gloves on?

04:07.715 --> 04:09.881
[Ronald] Yes,
it's gonna be awesome.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.917
<i>[Shauna] The costumes
he was suggesting didn't fit.</i>

04:11.919 --> 04:14.620
And it made me
very uncomfortable.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.590
<i>Like, the mask he put on, it would
shake and the gloves wouldn't fit.</i>

04:18.592 --> 04:20.025
- [exhales] - [Patty]
That's the real meaning

04:20.027 --> 04:22.628
- of Halloween, right, Shauna?
- [Mark] Being uncomfortable.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.763
[Patty] Just being something
that you're not.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.899
Because it didn't fit perfectly
or somewhat perfectly

04:27.901 --> 04:31.803
to the point where I knew I could edit
it and make myself comfortable in it,

04:31.805 --> 04:34.072
I started to have
a panic attack.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.081
[Patty] Okay.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.151
<i>Shauna does deal
with panic attacks.</i>

04:46.153 --> 04:50.122
It can be brought on by a lot of
different things, but usually when she's...

04:50.791 --> 04:53.091
um, out of her element.

04:53.894 --> 04:58.997
And, at the same time,
kind of backed into a corner.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.666
And she just doesn't know
how to handle it.

05:00.668 --> 05:04.069
When she has those
panic attacks, for me,

05:05.673 --> 05:10.175
all I want to do
is find a way to help her,

05:11.078 --> 05:14.146
um... sometimes
you don't know how.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.018
<i>I would suppose
that some people could say</i>

05:20.020 --> 05:24.923
<i>that me comforting her
in those times of her panic</i>

05:24.925 --> 05:27.392
is another way
that I coddle her.

05:27.961 --> 05:32.497
Um, but in my mind,

05:32.499 --> 05:36.735
<i>if she is having a stressful
situation, and I can help,</i>

05:36.737 --> 05:38.103
why wouldn't I do that?

05:38.605 --> 05:42.607
[Shauna] I'm very close
to just checking out.

05:42.609 --> 05:46.078
[Patty] Okay, we're just gonna
relax for a second, that's all.

05:46.080 --> 05:52.818
I think my panic attacks
started when I was younger,

05:52.820 --> 05:54.453
probably around...

05:56.724 --> 05:59.524
12, 14, um,

05:59.526 --> 06:05.297
I think they were just triggered
by the feeling of being alone and

06:05.833 --> 06:08.967
the feeling that no one
was in my corner.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.704
<i>And I'm still trying to deal
with the anxious feelings</i>

06:12.706 --> 06:14.706
<i>'cause they're always
gonna happen.</i>

06:14.708 --> 06:19.945
And as long as I stay in that positivity
mindset, I can kind of brush it aside,

06:19.947 --> 06:25.150
It's just... how much I can
build it up until I explode.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.087
[Patty] All right,
you're gonna sit down.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.254
But you have to decide
on something,

06:30.256 --> 06:31.823
-that'll be quicker.
-[Shauna] But I can't. I don't--

06:31.825 --> 06:34.693
- Let's focus on Tara's. Okay.
- Okay.

06:34.695 --> 06:39.698
<i>[Shauna] Mark and Rylee really ran
with the Tara and Jesse costume idea.</i>

06:39.700 --> 06:41.733
She's supposed to be a what?
A devil.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.535
- She's a... No, she's...
- [Patty] What is she?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.737
- [Rylee] A vampire.
- [Mark] We got her fangs.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.574
And he's a vampire hunter, and he
messed up and she got 'em already.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.909
- Okay.
- We have a whole story.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.178
- Okay, well then, we need to
pick out-- - What? He messed up?

06:53.180 --> 06:54.813
- Yeah, he messed up.
- [Mark] Yeah.

06:54.815 --> 06:55.814
You wanna be a vampire?

06:55.816 --> 06:56.882
[Shauna] That's Tara.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.049
I'm saying you can be one, too.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.718
You can be a fallen one.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.219
- He already got ya one.
- A fallen one.

07:01.221 --> 07:05.957
I don't want to make my
costume match Tara and Jesse's.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.992
What the hell is that?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.059
- [Shauna] That's a g-string, mama.
- Okay.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.961
Well, that you can keep.

07:09.963 --> 07:10.929
[Mark] Go easy on them,
they're grown-ups, okay?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.931
[Rylee] Get the g-string, mama.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.801
<i>[Shauna] Unfortunately, I think
that's the only option I have.</i>

07:15.803 --> 07:17.169
[Rylee] It unlatches.

07:17.171 --> 07:22.340
So, I'm a baby vampire hunter,
I don't know what I am.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.975
I'm a hodge podge of crap.

07:23.977 --> 07:27.045
You can wear leggings
and you can wear your boots

07:27.047 --> 07:29.181
-that are tall.
-Yeah, you got black boots. Yeah, you'll be good.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.282
You're good.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.050
Good job.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.653
<i>[Shauna] We have a lot of
Halloween activities planned.</i>

07:34.655 --> 07:38.190
The Halloween Festival
where we're all gonna dress up,

07:38.192 --> 07:41.426
which is fun 'cause we all
haven't dressed up in awhile.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.062
- Like, together.
- I'm a little worried about that part.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.932
<i>- [Rylee] Um, we're very into spooky things.
- [Shauna] Yeah.</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:48.200
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.302
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- [Ronald] Bye-bye.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.511
Are you eating a steak?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.513
Yeah, one's mine, one's yours.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.981
Don't point with the knife.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.016
<i>[Shauna] Tara's in town
for Halloween.</i>

08:05.018 --> 08:08.787
<i>Recently, Rylee and I got back from
the bachelorette weekend in Pittsburgh</i>

08:08.789 --> 08:13.525
and Tara and I never talked
about what happened at the bar.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.594
That kind of stuff happens
all the time with Tara and I.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.930
<i>We just let it go
after the moment.</i>

08:18.932 --> 08:23.068
You know, what happens in
Pittsburgh, stays in Pittsburgh.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.170
[Mark] Mmm, you want
butter? Which one do you want?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.204
[Tara] Whatever.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.506
Odd, you take a shot

08:27.508 --> 08:29.474
- on the butter.
- Tara, no. No.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.681
I don't get why y'all are so
involved in my romantic life.

08:36.683 --> 08:37.649
It's none of your business.

08:37.651 --> 08:41.086
We did make you
a dating profile together.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.256
<i>.[Shauna] I have been putting myself
out there more when it comes to dating.</i>

08:44.258 --> 08:46.091
My sister set up
an online profile

08:46.093 --> 08:48.360
and I was set up
by a matchmaker.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.728
[Abraham] I'm very thankful
to be here.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.997
<i>[Shauna] Online dating
isn't really for me.</i>

08:51.999 --> 08:53.965
<i>I did have fun on my date
with Abraham though,</i>

08:53.967 --> 08:57.102
<i>but since then,
it just kind of fizzled out.</i>

08:57.104 --> 09:00.405
But I am still hopeful that the
right guy for me is out there.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.808
How do you eat this?

09:03.810 --> 09:07.112
- [Rylee] With our mouth.
- It looks like a dead caterpillar.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.748
<i>I've been taking steps
towards my independence,</i>

09:09.750 --> 09:11.850
<i>but one of the next steps
is moving out</i>

09:11.852 --> 09:14.452
and it's time to talk
to my family about that.

09:14.454 --> 09:18.223
<i>I'm not excited about talking
to my parents about moving out.</i>

09:18.225 --> 09:21.826
<i>One, because Tara's there
and Tara elevates everything.</i>

09:21.828 --> 09:24.763
But two, it's gonna be a no.

09:24.765 --> 09:28.166
It's already automatically
prepared for no.

09:28.168 --> 09:32.003
So, what do y'all think
about me moving out?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.539
So, what is your timeline...

09:36.143 --> 09:39.911
- for wanting all of this to happen?
- Six months.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.246
- What?
- Whoa.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.380
[Mark coughs]

09:42.816 --> 09:44.181
[Mark] The hell?

09:44.418 --> 09:47.519
We all know it would be more
peaceful with me out of this house.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.221
- [Mark] Hey, you know...
- [Patty] Shauna, quit being so negative.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.558
So do you honestly think you can

09:53.894 --> 09:55.927
monetarily move out?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.964
- No, they won't let me move out, that's the issue.
- [Tara] But, do you think

09:58.966 --> 10:01.933
your money goes a long way
when you move out?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.902
- No.
- Like, do you think that you could...

10:03.904 --> 10:07.072
- manage without them?
- No, that's why I'm still living here, Tara.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.175
It's just a discussion.

10:10.177 --> 10:14.980
I still live at home. That's because of
my mom not wanting me to live alone.

10:14.982 --> 10:19.117
<i>And the fact that I don't have
money, so I do need a job.</i>

10:19.119 --> 10:21.286
Like, I don't have
any other plans thought out

10:21.288 --> 10:23.788
because there's no option
of me moving out.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.957
But if you have a plan,

10:26.226 --> 10:27.659
then it's more persuasive

10:27.661 --> 10:29.861
- to them.
- No, nothing's persuasive towards our parents

10:29.863 --> 10:31.963
when it comes to me,
you know that.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.866
<i>[Patty] My fears about Shauna
moving out on her own,</i>

10:34.868 --> 10:36.935
<i>of course, of her safety.</i>

10:36.937 --> 10:40.538
It's absolutely understanding
that Shauna gets frustrated

10:41.074 --> 10:44.342
in the way that we treated Tara

10:45.078 --> 10:47.646
and her moving out
and doing certain things,

10:47.648 --> 10:50.415
to the way we treat Shauna.

10:52.019 --> 10:56.421
I know that Shauna wants to achieve
the same things that Tara has going on.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.123
Um...

10:58.825 --> 10:59.924
It's...

10:59.926 --> 11:01.860
- It's gotta take a different path.
- Yeah.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.162
It just takes
a little more time.

11:04.164 --> 11:09.000
Shauna, you have people all around
you that only want to keep you safe,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.069
that only have your best
interests at heart.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.039
And you're like,
"I'm in hell."

11:14.041 --> 11:19.277
I'm co-dependent, I'm rejected
all the time for who I am, um...

11:20.914 --> 11:22.614
And I feel worthless
every day of my life.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.683
Is that what you wanna hear?

11:24.685 --> 11:29.854
That's not what I wanna hear, but
if that's the way you feel, thank you.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.258
You know, but the thing is is that, I
mean, you're definitely not worthless.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.127
You have to say that.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.896
- No, I don't.
- You raised me,

11:37.898 --> 11:39.831
- you have to say that.
- No, I don't. Shauna.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.499
You're not worthless.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.269
<i>[Shauna] It's hard to look at it
from my parents' perspective</i>

11:44.271 --> 11:48.206
because I have to go back to this
weak kind of mentality in a sense.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.844
And realize my vulnerabilities and that
puts me in a really bad place mentally.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.281
And it's hard to get that
across to my parents.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.517
So, I think I handled it
the best way I could.

11:59.519 --> 12:03.655
But at the same time, I think
my parents need to understand

12:03.657 --> 12:06.925
on an emotional level a little
more where I was coming from.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.794
<i>I have always been working
on my positivity.</i>

12:09.796 --> 12:13.164
<i>I am definitely more positive
than I've ever been.</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:17.569
<i>And it's always going to be
a day to day thing, it's just...</i>

12:17.571 --> 12:22.140
<i>about looking in the mirror
and being more thankful than not.</i>

12:22.142 --> 12:26.144
And thinking more positive
things than negative things.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.214
You just gotta get out
of your own head.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.983
And we can figure out
the rest of the [bleep].

12:32.185 --> 12:33.685
We can figure out
how you can drive,

12:33.687 --> 12:35.286
we can figure out
how you can get a house,

12:35.288 --> 12:38.656
we can figure out how you
can get somebody that'll love you

12:38.658 --> 12:40.358
as much as you love them.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.829
I think Shauna's passion to want
to be independent is warranted.

12:44.831 --> 12:50.502
I think all of her life has been
people telling her she can't do things

12:50.504 --> 12:54.005
because of her height
or something else.

12:54.007 --> 12:58.276
And it's almost like she's
being told that again in a way.

12:58.712 --> 13:01.780
But by just, like, life,
in general.

13:01.782 --> 13:06.417
So, she's not gonna take no for
an answer and take it laying down,

13:06.419 --> 13:10.021
<i>she's gonna stand up and
fight and try to be independent.</i>

13:10.023 --> 13:11.923
[Patty] Let's move forward.

13:11.925 --> 13:17.328
Let's turn the page, put a smile on
our face, and try something different.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.230
Okay?

13:20.867 --> 13:22.867
- Okay. Good stuff.
- [Rylee] It was a lovely dinner.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.969
[laughs] Yum.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.439
<i>[Shauna] In the moving out
timeline I'm in,</i>

13:28.441 --> 13:33.745
it's really depending on whether
Rylee and I get our driver's license

13:33.747 --> 13:36.948
and whether or not we're financially
stable enough to support ourselves.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.818
I'm still thinking
the best bet in the beginning

13:39.820 --> 13:43.121
would be to either move in
with a friend or Rylee

13:43.123 --> 13:47.492
but, um, I'm always constantly
going to look towards the next step.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.861
- [burps]
- There you go.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.162
[Rylee laughing]

13:51.164 --> 13:51.830
Shauna.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.364
What?

13:53.366 --> 13:56.100
<i>Even though things can get a
little tense with my family at times,</i>

13:56.102 --> 13:59.137
<i>especially when it comes
to talking about moving out,</i>

13:59.139 --> 14:01.472
I know they still have
the best interest at heart.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.375
<i>We have a lot of fun things
planned for this weekend,</i>

14:04.377 --> 14:08.146
<i>so I'm hoping that we can all move
past everything and enjoy being together.</i>

14:08.982 --> 14:10.215
Sky drop.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.617
We are going to decorate
the house together.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.052
- [thuds]
- [Shauna] Ow.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.090
My family is concerned with how
much I'm having these migraines

14:19.092 --> 14:22.093
because they do start
where the tumor was.

14:22.095 --> 14:26.631
And from the first time I had one of these
migraines, I thought I had cancer again.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.933
<i>So I'm going
to see a neurologist.</i>

14:30.003 --> 14:32.737
<i>Tell me a little bit about
what's going on right now for you</i>

14:32.739 --> 14:34.072
<i>in your dating life.</i>

14:34.074 --> 14:37.709
I have been putting myself out
there more when it comes to dating.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.511
<i>And today I'm checking in
with my matchmaker, Gabby.</i>

14:40.513 --> 14:42.480
<i>I actually think I found someone</i>

14:42.482 --> 14:45.149
<i>that I'm really interested
in introducing you to.</i>

14:45.151 --> 14:51.089
<i>He's in a very unique position
to really understand you.</i>

14:58.999 --> 15:00.832
Sky drop [laughs].

15:00.834 --> 15:02.033
At some point.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.335
Sure, just stand there.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.304
I don't have a pillow
right there or anything.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.873
Ah.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.942
Ta-da. My work is done.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.977
No, I don't think so.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.880
We don't usually
decorate for Halloween.

15:15.882 --> 15:21.119
We usually just bring down a big thing
of costumes before and fish through it.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.888
Mom was never really big
on decorating for Halloween,

15:23.890 --> 15:26.457
but I think Tara
coming into town

15:26.927 --> 15:30.295
- changed the whole demeanor of it.
- Yeah.

15:30.297 --> 15:34.866
It just... It caused my mom to
kind of go into a decorating frenzy.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.068
It must be in the other box
down there, but I don't know.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.370
Sahara, do not eat the spider.

15:40.907 --> 15:41.839
- [thuds]
- [Shauna] Ow!

15:41.841 --> 15:43.141
I'm so sorry.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.344
- Are you okay?
- [Shauna exclaims]

15:49.049 --> 15:49.814
[Mark] I know.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.082
I'm sorry.

15:51.985 --> 15:55.119
I have baby migraines
almost everyday

15:55.121 --> 15:57.522
when I wake up
or when I go to sleep.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.825
It makes it very difficult
to sleep sometimes.

16:00.827 --> 16:05.063
Um, but during house decorating,
I had a very bad migraine.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.197
[Shauna exclaims]

16:07.867 --> 16:09.400
Breathe.

16:11.237 --> 16:13.771
- [Patty laughs] <i>- [Shauna] I have
seen a doctor about my migraines</i>

16:13.773 --> 16:16.741
<i>in the past, but when I went
to see Dr. Sheik,</i>

16:16.743 --> 16:19.177
<i>she said that I should go see
another neurologist</i>

16:19.179 --> 16:22.613
<i>because of how often
my migraines are happening.</i>

16:22.615 --> 16:25.850
It's very scary because my
tumor could always develop again

16:25.852 --> 16:30.088
and these migraines could be
sign of a baby tumor being developed

16:30.090 --> 16:33.858
and I have no clue, which is why
I should get checked up regularly,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.127
and I should get MRIs
and all these things

16:36.129 --> 16:38.529
to make sure it's just
my dead brain tissue.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.500
- Don't cut my finger.
- I'm not trying to.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.534
[Rylee exclaims]

16:44.004 --> 16:47.005
Spiderweb,
not my forte, apparently.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.907
[Shauna] I have booked <i>an
appointment with a neurologist</i>

16:49.909 --> 16:53.811
because my migraines have gotten
severely worse and more frequent.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.813
And my mom and I
are both worried

16:55.815 --> 16:57.348
that the cancer
may have returned.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.983
[Patty] You wanna do
the hallway, Shauna?

16:58.985 --> 17:02.220
<i>[Rylee] It's really scary to know
that Shauna has migraines so often.</i>

17:02.222 --> 17:05.056
We're all scared that
anytime she gets a headache,

17:05.859 --> 17:07.158
it's something else.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.128
You know?
So that's terrifying.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.764
You are not putting that
on the table.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.199
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever seen you do.

17:15.201 --> 17:19.103
- [Patty laughs] - She's gonna
put glitter on the freaking table.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.872
Glitter is great.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.340
- No.
- Glitter is grand.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.076
- Glitter is never leaving, that's what glitter is.
- Glitter is good.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.176
[both laugh]

17:26.178 --> 17:27.945
- [Tara] You're gonna leave it?
- [Shauna] No.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.114
- [Mark] Is she serious?
- Mama, don't do it.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.786
Happy Halloween [laughs].

17:34.788 --> 17:39.157
My mom thought it would be a good
idea just to throw the glitter everywhere,

17:39.159 --> 17:41.192
which isn't smart.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.060
- [Mark laughs]
- [Patty exclaims]

17:42.062 --> 17:43.828
[Tara] Why me?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.330
- [Patty] Yeah, you.
- There you go.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.333
<i>[Tara] Overall,
the house looks...</i>

17:50.503 --> 17:51.469
okay.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.171
[laughs]

17:53.173 --> 17:56.674
- The house is a hot
mess, but-- - [both laughing]

17:56.676 --> 17:58.776
Ah, it's fun.
We had a good time.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.279
<i>I think it's not so much
what it looks like,</i>

18:01.281 --> 18:02.513
<i>- it's more just doing--
- Hanging out.</i>

18:02.515 --> 18:04.215
Yep. Whoo.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.525
Today, I'm going to go see a
neurologist for my migraines.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.763
<i>I have migraines a lot.</i>

18:18.765 --> 18:22.066
<i>I had one while decorating
the house for Halloween.</i>

18:23.670 --> 18:25.903
I don't care for neurologists.

18:25.905 --> 18:30.174
Oh. Hopefully, it will give us
some answers.

18:30.176 --> 18:34.011
It definitely worries me with the
amount of migraines that she's having,

18:34.013 --> 18:36.414
and the intensity that they are,

18:36.416 --> 18:39.150
that this could be
something more.

18:39.152 --> 18:43.888
<i>You know, another early
diagnosis of cancer that's come back.</i>

18:43.890 --> 18:46.891
So it's just, like, you got...

18:46.893 --> 18:49.927
You've got to take
all of this so seriously.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.897
- Step over here and take your temperature please.
- [woman] Yeah, we all do.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.099
- How?
<i>- [device] Stand closer please.</i>

18:55.101 --> 18:56.534
- Tilt it down.
- [woman] You can tilt it, yes.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.170
Oh, it's gonna tell her
to put a mask on.

18:59.172 --> 19:03.274
<i>[Shauna] I've known about this
temperature height thing where you stand</i>

19:03.276 --> 19:04.842
<i>and you get
your temperature taken.</i>

19:04.844 --> 19:08.179
<i>A lot of jumping
is necessary for that.</i>

19:08.181 --> 19:09.247
<i>[device] Temperature normal.</i>

19:09.249 --> 19:09.947
Oh, there you go.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.716
There you go.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.720
COVID is definitely providing
a new challenge, I will say that.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.755
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- [both] Hi.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.657
- I'm Dr. Mikhaylova.
- I'm Shauna.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.758
- Shauna, pleasure.
- I'm Patty.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.894
- Patty, nice to meet you both.
- Nice to meet you.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.463
I see a lot of patients with
migraines in this practice.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.865
Migraines are a very
common condition.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.568
<i>It's the sixth leading cause
of disability in United States</i>

19:30.570 --> 19:32.870
<i>and often missed and mistreated.</i>

19:32.872 --> 19:34.906
<i>So I'm glad she was referred
to this practice,</i>

19:34.908 --> 19:37.141
so we can get a better handle
on the migraines.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.144
I know that you had surgery
when you were six months old,

19:40.146 --> 19:41.345
can you tell me more about that?

19:41.347 --> 19:44.849
- Maybe your mom can also fill in?
- She's got all that info.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.218
- [Dr. Mikhaylova] She has that information. Yeah.
- Pull that in.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.587
She had a bulge on her head

19:49.589 --> 19:52.990
and it was thought that
her soft spot was growing off

19:52.992 --> 19:59.997
and they did an X-ray of her and
found out it was a cancer mass.

20:01.768 --> 20:05.937
<i>Watching your child go through
cancer at such a young age,</i>

20:06.105 --> 20:08.306
<i>it's extremely difficult.</i>

20:08.308 --> 20:10.408
<i>People tell you
that it's not your fault,</i>

20:12.111 --> 20:13.344
but that's what you feel.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.513
I'm the mom.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.217
I carried her in my belly.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.224
So I must've done
something wrong.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.230
<i>And it's up to me
to carry that burden.</i>

20:33.399 --> 20:34.599
<i>It just is.</i>

20:35.935 --> 20:38.002
- It's been quite a journey is what it sounds like.
- Yes.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.103
You've been through a lot.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.605
Yeah, this is Shauna's journey.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.938
This is Shauna's journey.

20:41.940 --> 20:45.676
So, let's do an exam, and see
where we need to go from here.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.346
- All right, so how we can kinda help the situation.
- Okay.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.115
<i>[Patty] I always
want her checked fully.</i>

20:51.117 --> 20:54.018
<i>[Shauna] Yeah, she wants
a whole medical check, like.</i>

20:54.020 --> 20:57.955
- If Shauna could get an MRI.
- CT scans.

20:57.957 --> 20:58.889
More blood work.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.059
Everything done to
make sure she's okay

21:02.061 --> 21:04.662
and cancer isn't anywhere
in her body.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.731
That would
make me feel a lot better.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.733
Go ahead take this finger,
touch your nose.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.801
<i>[Shauna] I understand her fear.</i>

21:10.803 --> 21:14.038
Like, she went through it. She saw
the baby with the cancer. I did not.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.773
Point to point.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.442
<i>[Shauna] So I get that she has a
constant fear that it's gonna come back.</i>

21:18.444 --> 21:21.579
But, her worrying
stresses me out.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.915
That's not good for either
of us if I'm stressed out.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.551
- Just stand like that for a few seconds.
- Okay.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.957
-Very good. Now, you can have a seat.
-Okay.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.894
- All right.
- Should she get another MRI soon?

21:36.896 --> 21:40.598
I think we... No, we generally
don't need to repeat an MRI.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.034
For now, I don't think we
need to do any additional tests.

21:43.036 --> 21:46.937
We gonna kinda see how you respond
to just conservative treatment first.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.673
- Okay.
- Migraines aren't just a headache.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.041
As you can attest to.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.843
They have all these other
symptoms that accompany them

21:52.845 --> 21:55.546
- that make your life pretty difficult.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:55.548 --> 21:59.116
To what extent the brain
surgery contributed to this,

21:59.118 --> 22:03.020
it's difficult to say, it's probably
a combination of different factors.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.689
When we talk about
how to treat this,

22:04.691 --> 22:07.258
we have to
take into account triggers.

22:07.260 --> 22:10.628
- [Shauna] Mmm-hmm.
- Changes in both your internal and external environment,

22:10.630 --> 22:13.030
that could be setting off
these symptoms, right?

22:13.032 --> 22:15.900
So, part of these triggers
include stress,

22:15.902 --> 22:18.636
includes the types of foods
you're putting into your body,

22:18.638 --> 22:20.671
and also includes
how well you're sleeping.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.740
Because if these things
are out of balance

22:22.742 --> 22:26.477
you're more likely to have your
brain respond in this sort of way.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.680
And get migraines with
these debilitating symptoms.

22:29.682 --> 22:33.884
The neurologist did say that all my
migraine symptoms seem to be normal.

22:33.886 --> 22:37.855
And not anything out of the
normal given my condition.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.858
<i>She also said that, it's
most likely due to my diet,</i>

22:40.860 --> 22:44.195
<i>my sleep, and my stress levels.</i>

22:44.197 --> 22:46.797
So, we're gonna work on those.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.701
<i>It was a huge relief that the neurologist
wasn't alarmed by my symptoms.</i>

22:50.703 --> 22:52.870
<i>Or my physical exam.</i>

22:52.872 --> 22:56.207
I think that it's a huge
relief for Mother too.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.843
Um, but at the same time,
I still have migraines.

22:58.845 --> 23:01.011
And they still
have to be solved.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.948
All right, so we're gonna check in
again with one and another in six weeks.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.950
And see where we go from there.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.985
Awesome. All right.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.286
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:12.825 --> 23:13.991
See this is argh!

23:13.993 --> 23:16.026
I don't have the boobs for this!

23:16.028 --> 23:18.729
That outfit
was just a lot for me.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.897
I look like a whore.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.133
<i>The fact that it
didn't fit properly,</i>

23:22.135 --> 23:25.736
that I had to be taped in to
it, and safety pinned in to it.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.538
Was a huge issue for me.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.307
I don't know
what I'm doing, Rylee!

23:36.916 --> 23:40.785
<i>[Tara] My fiance, Jesse, is in
town so we can celebrate Halloween.</i>

23:40.787 --> 23:42.853
- Isn't it cool?
- That's kinda cool.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.122
I'm very happy
to be here for Halloween.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.159
And spend time with my family.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.261
Where are the costumes?
What are we doing?

23:50.263 --> 23:52.229
We're all gonna
get dressed up and go down

23:52.231 --> 23:54.231
to a Halloween festival.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.168
You're a vampire hunter.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.669
- [Tara] And I'm the vampire.
- Oh! I get to kill her?

23:58.671 --> 24:02.039
And you get bit,
and she gets staked.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.911
Jesse's costume was cool.
I liked your costume.

24:06.913 --> 24:07.978
<i>It was</i>

24:08.214 --> 24:09.947
like blandish.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.248
But, the coat was cool.

24:13.386 --> 24:14.685
- That's nice.
- Thanks.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.821
- Welcome.
- It's poufy.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.123
- We've never dressed up together for Halloween.
- [Jesse] Never.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.525
Ever. So, I think
they did a good job.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.160
Why aren't we buttoning this?

24:23.162 --> 24:26.864
My Halloween costume
was just a steampunk person.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.934
This doesn't fit. At all.

24:29.936 --> 24:33.103
<i>[Tara] Shauna's costume
was uncomfortable for her.</i>

24:33.105 --> 24:35.039
She was in like a nighty.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.943
She's not a person that gets put
in a nighty and feels comfortable.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.512
And then her size
is always a problem.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.080
See this is argh!

24:44.750 --> 24:46.517
I don't have the boobs for this!

24:46.519 --> 24:48.018
[Patty] Do you
want this cut or not?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.188
I wanted it sewed.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.090
We don't have time.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.093
Halloween as a younger person,

24:56.095 --> 24:56.927
a smaller person,

24:56.929 --> 24:58.596
um, my Mom loved it.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.432
She loved dressing me up. I
was like a pageant doll to her.

25:01.434 --> 25:04.101
<i>And I enjoyed it because one,
I was making my Mom happy.</i>

25:04.103 --> 25:09.106
<i>But two, I still really wanted to dress
up as princesses and all this stuff.</i>

25:09.108 --> 25:12.977
But, as I got older,
it became more complicated.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.979
And my friends
would ask me to go out

25:14.981 --> 25:16.146
and I'd be like, well,

25:16.148 --> 25:19.083
I don't have an outfit
that I feel comfortable with.

25:19.085 --> 25:22.520
And they're like, well, I'm gonna
go as this but, like, it's a little sexy.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.721
And I was like, I can't do that,

25:23.723 --> 25:25.823
I'm showing up
in a penguin onesie.

25:25.825 --> 25:29.894
There's nothing sexy
about me dressing up like them

25:29.896 --> 25:32.363
because I didn't have anything
that would fit.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.466
- I just, I feel like a whore.
- Then let's go.

25:35.468 --> 25:40.004
<i>[Shauna] But also, I don't like
dressing in a very sexualized costume.</i>

25:40.006 --> 25:42.172
Just because of the stares
and the judgement.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.375
I don't want to
make anyone uncomfortable.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.843
And those stares
and those judgements

25:45.845 --> 25:49.747
make my Mother and my Father
uncomfortable, because they get questions.

25:49.749 --> 25:54.251
Because people are too scared to come up to
me and ask me if I'm an adult or anything.

26:04.797 --> 26:09.133
It's always been hard because
I've never felt understood.

26:09.135 --> 26:13.137
So I think my panic attacks
just happen because

26:13.139 --> 26:16.540
my anxiety built up
about not being understood.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.443
And then I just panic about

26:19.445 --> 26:22.513
not being understood in a
certain situation and I over think it.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.148
And

26:24.984 --> 26:27.518
it just goes out of proportion.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.788
And I cope with panic attacks

26:30.790 --> 26:34.058
by trying to separate myself
from the situation,

26:34.060 --> 26:35.960
doing breathing methods,

26:35.962 --> 26:38.529
just focusing on the positivity.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.034
[Patty] Rylee!

26:44.036 --> 26:46.937
[Shauna] I don't know
what I'm doing, Rylee!

26:46.939 --> 26:50.841
<i>[Rylee] Shauna tends to get
upset when things are happening.</i>

26:50.843 --> 26:53.310
Like, when we're just about
to leave the house

26:53.312 --> 26:54.778
she gets really stressed.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.381
And then when she
gets stressed and panics

26:57.383 --> 26:59.850
she tends
to freak out on people.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.153
So at this point
I just expect it every time.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.923
I leave you. All right,
I gotta go see Shauna.

27:05.925 --> 27:09.693
For my costume
we got spiderweb contacts.

27:09.695 --> 27:12.129
<i>But I've never had
any experience with contacts.</i>

27:12.131 --> 27:14.098
Here, go like this
with your eyelashes.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.800
<i>[Mark] Shauna's grumpy.</i>

27:16.802 --> 27:18.836
I don't know, she's been
having headaches and stuff lately.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.104
<i>And things aren't fitting right,</i>

27:20.106 --> 27:21.972
<i>and I think that pisses her off.</i>

27:21.974 --> 27:24.541
[Rylee] Eyelashes
and then put on.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.844
You know, she sees, you
know Tara putting on this dress,

27:26.846 --> 27:28.512
right off the rack and it fits.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.748
<i>And I'm sure
that pisses her off more.</i>

27:30.750 --> 27:32.516
<i>And...
I know it's frustrating.</i>

27:32.518 --> 27:34.251
<i>But at the same time it's like,</i>

27:34.253 --> 27:37.855
what are we supposed to do about
it? We're doing the best we can.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.624
Yeah, and this like this, and
then you're gonna put it like this.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.760
[Shauna] Uh-uh.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.196
When I do get frustrated like that, I
do just need like five minutes to myself.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.898
And it will go away.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.136
<i>And it'll still kinda be there in the
back of my head but I can get past it.</i>

27:52.138 --> 27:55.105
<i>And, at the end of the day,
like, five years down the road</i>

27:55.107 --> 27:57.508
I'm not gonna remember
the nighty as much,

27:57.510 --> 27:59.109
as I will remember fun moments.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.844
Ahhh.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.079
I've not idea what you're doing.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.814
Where would you...
Where would you stab her?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.349
- Not on my throat.
- Here?

28:05.351 --> 28:07.551
- Hmm?
- [Mark] You're supposed to go through the heart, Patty.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.520
Oh, right here?

28:09.522 --> 28:11.255
[Rylee] All right, do the
same thing you did before.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.290
Uh! Ugh, okay, sides.

28:13.292 --> 28:16.160
Side, up, down, make it right.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.327
Please.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.297
- I got a toy.
- Boing, boing.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.937
[Patty] Everybody in the car.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.339
- Good bye, good bye.
- [Mark] We're following behind you guys.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.149
Okay, so what are we doing?
Mini golfing?

28:39.151 --> 28:43.187
This place has mini golf, uh,
a corn maze.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.024
Yeah, so we can do anything.

28:56.736 --> 29:00.270
On the way to the Halloween
festival my matchmaker texted me

29:00.272 --> 29:03.474
about a potential match, and
we're gonna connect after Halloween.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.980
<i>[Mark] We got
to the Halloween festival</i>

29:09.982 --> 29:13.150
<i>and that's when Patty and I
had to get suited up.</i>

29:13.152 --> 29:14.218
Oh, my God!

29:14.920 --> 29:16.820
The hell?

29:16.822 --> 29:19.423
It was actually the first time
we ever put those things on.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.525
[Patty] Where am I going?

29:25.831 --> 29:27.264
Lift it. Okay, okay.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.069
[Mark] Let's go!

29:38.043 --> 29:41.245
<i>[Tara] There was a lot of
attention on us, from the start.</i>

29:41.247 --> 29:44.414
Because we had
two giant dinosaurs.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.620
<i>[Rylee] I think it's important
to get as much family time</i>

29:49.622 --> 29:51.922
as possible before we move out.

29:51.924 --> 29:57.027
<i>Because it's going to help my
family accept us leaving better.</i>

29:57.029 --> 29:58.128
<i>Cause they'll be annoyed of us.</i>

29:58.130 --> 29:59.730
<i>And want us out anyway.</i>

29:59.732 --> 30:01.899
I think they're already
annoyed of us.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.467
But they still
don't want us to leave.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.937
This is eight.

30:06.939 --> 30:10.674
<i>[Patty] Playing putt-putt in a
dinosaurs costume's nearly impossible.</i>

30:10.676 --> 30:12.910
<i>[Mark] Yeah, I couldn't see
where to put the ball down.</i>

30:12.912 --> 30:14.778
<i>[Patty] Tried to get
the ball down, had a problem.</i>

30:14.780 --> 30:16.713
Had to hit the ball,
had a problem.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.849
<i>Tried to get the ball out
of the cup, had a problem.</i>

30:18.851 --> 30:21.451
<i>- Just a problem.
-[Mark] But it was fun. I had a really good time.</i>

30:25.324 --> 30:29.059
<i>[Rylee] I decided to ditch the
putt-putt and go into the corn maze</i>

30:29.161 --> 30:30.394
by myself.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.162
Cause I'm stupid.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.998
- Okay.
- [sinister music]

30:35.000 --> 30:36.200
Hi.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.369
I'm going back this way!

30:40.506 --> 30:42.005
Oh no!

30:45.911 --> 30:48.412
<i>I think we all enjoyed ourselves
at the Halloween festival.</i>

30:48.414 --> 30:50.013
<i>[Mark] I had an awesome time.</i>

30:50.015 --> 30:53.150
I think it was one of our best
Halloweens as a family, for sure.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.654
[Patty] 14 minutes!

30:57.656 --> 30:59.056
Ah, no, no, no, no!

30:59.058 --> 31:01.758
We are gonna have
a pumpkin carving contest

31:01.760 --> 31:04.695
<i>to see who can carve
the best pumpkin.</i>

31:04.697 --> 31:07.231
<i>[Jesse] The last thing
Shauna needs is a knife.</i>

31:07.233 --> 31:09.366
I don't think she should
be handed any weapons.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.335
- Ever.
- Ah!

31:21.814 --> 31:23.981
<i>[Tara] We are gonna have
a pumpkin carving contest</i>

31:23.983 --> 31:26.984
to see who can carve
the best pumpkin.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.253
[Shauna] Jesse, we got one
shaped like your head.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.855
- [Patty] Yeah, Shauna picked out your pumpkin.
- [Jesse] Oh, God.

31:31.857 --> 31:33.223
[Shauna] It's long and lumpy.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.994
All right, I'm leaving.

31:36.996 --> 31:40.664
<i>[Jesse] Shauna picking out
my pumpkin sized head</i>

31:40.666 --> 31:43.066
definitely means
I'm a part of the family.

31:43.068 --> 31:46.136
All right, so, yes,
we have a half hour.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.638
[Rylee] Oh, okay.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.374
- [Mark] 30 minutes.
- What about for people who've never carved a pumpkin?

31:50.376 --> 31:51.942
- You got 30 minutes.
- Okay.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.945
30 minutes is not enough time
to carve a pumpkin.

31:54.947 --> 31:55.946
- [Patty] All right.
- [Mark] Start?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.080
- [Patty] Go.
- [Mark] Okay.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.615
- [Rylee] Don't start yet!
- [Shauna] Stab!

31:58.617 --> 31:59.616
[Jesse] Shauna's killing things.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.518
- Shauna's just like, stab.
- [Shauna] Stab!

32:02.688 --> 32:04.655
<i>[Jesse] The last thing
Shauna needs is a knife.</i>

32:04.657 --> 32:07.190
That's why I sat at the opposite
side of the table from her.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.493
I don't think she should
be handed any weapons.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.395
- Ever.
- Ah!

32:14.967 --> 32:17.200
- [Shauna] You don't know how pumpkin carving works?
- No.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.069
[Shauna] You have to
gut it first.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.270
I do what I want.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.140
[Rylee] He...
Hey, this is a competition.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.408
So, I'm letting him go.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.609
[Patty laughing]

32:25.611 --> 32:27.945
- You're doing great, Jesse.
- Thank you.

32:29.014 --> 32:32.049
<i>[Shauna] I've always enjoyed
watching pumpkins be carved.</i>

32:32.051 --> 32:34.985
And, kinda,
destuffing a pumpkin.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.653
This is what mine's
gonna look like.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.921
[everyone laughing]

32:37.923 --> 32:41.959
- [Rylee] It's so tiny!
- [Patty] What is that baby face?

32:41.961 --> 32:45.662
The stencil was too small
for that pumpkin.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.197
[Tara] I'm gonna do another one.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.333
[Shauna] What kind of nose
was that to begin with?

32:49.702 --> 32:51.134
Mark!

32:51.136 --> 32:54.938
Will you come draw this
stencil larger on my pumpkin?

32:54.940 --> 32:56.873
- [Mark] Draw it larger?
- Yes, I want it larger.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.709
- Okay.
- [Rylee] Hey, wait!

32:58.711 --> 33:01.945
- [Patty laughing] - That seems
like against the rules right now.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.915
- [Shauna] How?
- Cause it's a competition.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.516
- How large do you want it?
- I want it to fit the face.

33:06.518 --> 33:07.583
Okay.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.286
And Rylee, it is fair,
cause I'm the only one

33:09.288 --> 33:11.955
in this house
that has no artistic ability.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.123
[Rylee] Well.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.558
Did you see the face I drew?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.126
[everyone laughing]

33:18.197 --> 33:20.430
[Shauna] You wanna go gentler?
You're gonna cut yourself.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.735
When there's a time limit.

33:24.737 --> 33:27.671
- There's just go.
- [Patty] There's competition.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.873
<i>[Shauna] It was nice
doing it again as a family.</i>

33:29.875 --> 33:32.776
<i>[Rylee] I think it was so much
fun doing it again as a family.</i>

33:32.778 --> 33:34.678
<i>Cause we're
a very competitive family.</i>

33:34.680 --> 33:38.582
We've had to stop family game
night because it gets so competitive.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.518
But at this point, it was just
a fun little thing to do.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.354
Like, we could have gotten
overly competitive.

33:45.057 --> 33:48.058
You only have 18 minutes.

33:54.666 --> 33:58.101
[Shauna] My lid if it goes
all the way in, it just falls.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.837
Yeah, my lid's just gonna
stay inside. He swallowed it.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.039
[Mark] Oh, okay.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.777
[Patty] 14 minutes!

34:06.779 --> 34:09.012
Ah, no, no, no, no!

34:09.014 --> 34:12.649
My confidence dwindled with
the time, if I'm being honest.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.786
<i>The closer it got down to it
the more I panicked.</i>

34:15.788 --> 34:17.521
- Ah!
- [Patty] You better hurry Rylee.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.356
- Did she break it?
- [Patty] You got two minutes.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.025
It's beautiful.

34:22.027 --> 34:24.661
- [Tara] Don't show that!
- [everyone laughing]

34:24.663 --> 34:26.329
We're judging you on this side.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.200
[Patty] Rylee,
you've got 15 seconds.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.502
- I'm done.
- You better get it to the table.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.938
- It's on the table.
- [Mark] Ten,

34:34.940 --> 34:36.039
nine, eight,

34:36.041 --> 34:37.808
- It's on the table.
- Five,

34:37.810 --> 34:39.876
- What do you want from me?
- Four, three,

34:39.878 --> 34:40.911
- What do you want from me?
- Two,

34:40.913 --> 34:42.746
[microwave beeping]

34:42.748 --> 34:46.183
It's on the table and she's telling
me to get it further on the table.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.456
Whoever votes for this one,
raise your hand

34:53.292 --> 34:54.357
You can't vote for your own.

34:54.359 --> 34:55.859
You can't vote for yours.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.527
- Boo!
- [Rylee] Against the rules.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.029
[Mark] So, that's a big zero.

34:59.998 --> 35:01.698
Whoever votes for this one?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.066
All right, Shauna
votes for mommy's.

35:03.068 --> 35:05.202
That's one vote for that one.

35:05.204 --> 35:08.171
Anybody vote for this one,
raise your hand.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.940
Okay, that's a nothing.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.274
[Patty] Ahhh!

35:11.276 --> 35:13.076
- Voting for this one?
- That's pretty good.

35:13.078 --> 35:15.178
I got, three, okay.

35:15.180 --> 35:19.382
I saw a puking pumpkin
online once and, ah!

35:19.384 --> 35:21.518
Ever since then I've just been
wanting to do one myself.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.653
So, yeah.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.789
Today's a bucket list day.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.390
- [Mark] Rylee's?
- [Patty] I like Rylee's too.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.191
Jesse's voting for Rylee.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.392
- Okay.
- [Jesse] There ya go.

35:30.762 --> 35:33.230
My pumpkin won with three votes.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.665
And, I believe it should
have been a landslide.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.601
I think we all did a good job.

35:37.603 --> 35:41.238
Now what we need to do, is take all
and put them on the front porch, all right.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.840
[Rylee] Fire hazard.
Let's walk with the candles.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.208
[Patty laughing]

35:47.946 --> 35:50.113
<i>[Mark] Spending Halloween as
a family, I thought was awesome.</i>

35:50.115 --> 35:53.049
<i>[Patty] We did a lot of things that
we haven't done for a really long time.</i>

35:53.051 --> 35:55.152
It's like the best
Halloween ever.

35:59.224 --> 36:01.925
<i>How did things go with Abraham?</i>

36:01.927 --> 36:04.327
Um, the date went well.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.998
My feelings about dating
and finding a relationship

36:08.000 --> 36:09.699
are it'll happen
when it happens.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.601
<i>I actually think I found someone</i>

36:11.603 --> 36:14.371
<i>that I'm really interested
in introducing you to.</i>

36:25.350 --> 36:27.918
<i>[Shauna] I have been putting myself
out there more when it comes to dating.</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:31.321
And today I'm checking in
with my matchmaker, Gabby.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.597
My feelings currently about
dating and finding a relationship

36:40.599 --> 36:43.033
are it'll happen
when it happens.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.875
<i>A few weeks ago Gabby
set me up on a couple dates.</i>

36:51.877 --> 36:55.078
<i>And during the Halloween
festival I got a text,</i>

36:55.080 --> 36:56.813
<i>and she told me about
a potential match</i>

36:56.815 --> 36:59.683
and I'm excited
to hear about this guy.

36:59.685 --> 37:03.119
<i>- Hey, nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you again too.</i>

37:03.121 --> 37:06.523
<i>So, let's catch up
a little bit, um, tell me,</i>

37:06.525 --> 37:08.858
<i>how things are going for you.</i>

37:08.860 --> 37:11.962
<i>And, first of all, I want to
apologize for that first cancelled date.</i>

37:11.964 --> 37:13.730
Oh, no. It's okay.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.632
<i>I wish I could control
the way people behave.</i>

37:15.634 --> 37:18.702
<i>Sometimes there's just terrible
behavior out in the dating world.</i>

37:18.704 --> 37:22.839
My first date and I
were supposed to go bowling.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.141
But on my way there
he cancelled.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.910
What happened? What?

37:26.912 --> 37:27.978
He cancelled!

37:27.980 --> 37:29.446
- Are you [bleep] me?
- Yeah.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.715
What a prick.

37:31.717 --> 37:35.085
And instead my family
and I went bowling.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.887
<i>More interesting and excitingly</i>

37:37.889 --> 37:40.957
<i>how did things go with Abraham?</i>

37:40.959 --> 37:42.993
<i>Very excited
to hear the feedback.</i>

37:42.995 --> 37:44.894
Um, the date went well.

37:44.896 --> 37:45.795
Um,

37:45.864 --> 37:47.196
he was really nice.

37:47.566 --> 37:51.534
He's got a lot of features and
attributes that I'm looking for.

37:51.536 --> 37:53.603
- Um-- <i>- Tell me what
those features were.</i>

37:53.605 --> 37:54.938
<i>What did you like about him?</i>

37:54.940 --> 37:58.041
I liked that he
had his head on his shoulders.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.843
Like, he knew who he was.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.545
Um, he was confident.

38:02.547 --> 38:06.249
He had this, like,
self-assurance about himself.

38:06.685 --> 38:07.884
Um,

38:07.886 --> 38:10.020
I will say, he was really tall.

38:10.022 --> 38:12.055
So I think that kinda
threw him off a little bit.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.924
Um, we

38:14.926 --> 38:16.960
continued talking afterwards.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.130
Um, no action
was made on either end.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.432
And we kinda stopped.
It kinda fizzled.

38:22.434 --> 38:27.103
Um, he was a nice guy though,
it just didn't work out.

38:27.105 --> 38:31.841
<i>Tell me a little bit about what's going
on right now for you in your dating life.</i>

38:31.843 --> 38:34.911
Um, well, right now I'm...

38:34.913 --> 38:37.814
I'm like talking to people
as friends.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.617
Just, kind of, looking for
that friendship to develop

38:40.619 --> 38:43.753
before I look for anything
romantic wise.

38:43.755 --> 38:47.957
Because I don't want to get
used or screwed over in any way.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.894
Um, I'm still open to looking
for other people,

38:50.896 --> 38:54.030
it's just it hasn't happened
at this moment yet.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.965
I think I want
a long-term relationship.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.000
I've

38:58.837 --> 39:01.171
never had a health
long-term relationship.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.273
So I can't really say
that's what I want.

39:03.275 --> 39:05.508
Um, but it is something

39:05.844 --> 39:07.477
I'm looking for.

39:09.147 --> 39:12.015
<i>Well, I've been keeping
my eyes open for you.</i>

39:12.017 --> 39:14.451
<i>And I actually think
I've found someone</i>

39:14.453 --> 39:17.520
<i>that I'm really interested
in introducing you to.</i>

39:17.522 --> 39:21.324
<i>So, here are some things I think
are, sort of, interesting about him.</i>

39:21.326 --> 39:23.526
<i>- First of all, he's 22.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:26.930
<i>He's also a local guy,
he lives on Long Island.</i>

39:26.932 --> 39:31.301
<i>And I think there are some things
about this guy where he would</i>

39:31.303 --> 39:37.107
<i>be in a very unique position
to really understand</i>

39:37.175 --> 39:39.509
<i>particularly you.</i>

39:39.511 --> 39:43.079
<i>- And where you are coming from.
- Okay.</i>

39:44.149 --> 39:48.485
<i>When he was a child
he had cancer.</i>

39:49.955 --> 39:52.455
<i>And his pituitary gland
is dormant.</i>

39:54.359 --> 39:58.995
The guy she told me about she's
real excited cause he's unique like me.

39:58.997 --> 40:05.702
Um, he apparently had some
form of cancer in his childhood.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.571
<i>And his pituitary gland was
also rendered somewhat dormant.</i>

40:08.573 --> 40:11.074
So it's really
a unique situation.

40:11.076 --> 40:15.545
And it's really nice to know that he,
kinda, has a similar background as I do.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.214
<i>He never reached 5 feet tall.</i>

40:19.684 --> 40:24.120
For someone to catch my eye
and make me want to date them,

40:24.122 --> 40:28.758
like, you have to go through something
traumatic or scaring in your life,

40:28.760 --> 40:31.694
that emotional
brings you together in a way.

40:31.696 --> 40:35.098
<i>And I think he's
pretty excited to meet you.</i>

40:36.234 --> 40:39.402
<i>- Would you be excited to meet him?
- Um,</i>

40:41.840 --> 40:43.373
mmm-hmm, of course.

40:43.375 --> 40:44.574
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay. Great.</i>

40:44.576 --> 40:49.145
I was excited, I've never met
someone who can instantly

40:49.147 --> 40:52.715
look at all the issues that I've
had in life, and be like, oh, me too.

40:52.717 --> 40:55.952
Because it's such
a unique situation.

40:55.954 --> 40:59.956
And unfortunately dwarfism
on its own is rare.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.892
And my dwarfism
is even more rare.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.729
So it's just something I've
never even thought to consider.

41:06.731 --> 41:09.032
<i>All right, wonderful.
Well, I'm very excited to call</i>

41:09.034 --> 41:11.067
<i>and tell him that you're open
to meeting him.</i>

41:11.803 --> 41:12.535
Please do, thank you.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.203
<i>And you know, I'm here also.</i>

41:14.205 --> 41:17.774
<i>If you have any questions, any
concerns feel free to reach out to me.</i>

41:17.776 --> 41:20.310
Okay, of course. Thank you.

41:20.312 --> 41:23.046
I would be extremely grateful to
have someone who can understand me

41:23.048 --> 41:26.049
and my life, like this
person potentially can.

41:26.051 --> 41:28.751
<i>But, dating in general
makes me very anxious.</i>

41:28.753 --> 41:29.619
<i>But, I mean,</i>

41:29.621 --> 41:32.021
I'm gonna take the chance
to know someone,

41:32.023 --> 41:35.091
whether it's a friendship or
relationship that progresses from it.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.527
<i>But, I am hopeful
for the future.</i>

41:37.529 --> 41:39.996
♪ After all that has been
said and done ♪

41:39.998 --> 41:42.532
♪ It's sure impossible
to play someone ♪

41:42.534 --> 41:45.134
<i>I'm still learning how to
navigate life as a 22 year old,</i>

41:45.136 --> 41:47.036
<i>stuck in an 8 year old's body.</i>

41:48.940 --> 41:50.039
<i>I struggle to fit in.</i>

41:50.041 --> 41:52.108
<i>And I struggle
to have things fit.</i>

41:52.110 --> 41:54.077
<i>A lot of the world
is out of reach for me.</i>

41:54.079 --> 41:56.079
<i>Which makes me
worried to get a job,</i>

41:56.081 --> 41:57.580
<i>and move away from my family.</i>

41:57.582 --> 42:00.783
See, this is a
tall person thing.

42:00.785 --> 42:04.020
<i>I do wanna find love and find
someone to spend my life with.</i>

42:04.022 --> 42:06.356
And I think I will.
It's just gonna take time.

42:07.726 --> 42:10.260
There ya go!
Are you serious.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.830
<i>I think that I've grown,</i>

42:13.832 --> 42:17.433
but there's only so much you
grow when you still can't drive.

42:19.004 --> 42:20.637
And then when you can't grow.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.472
Oh! That would
have been funnier.

42:24.943 --> 42:27.944
There's only so much you
can grow when you can't grow.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.012
That's funny!
