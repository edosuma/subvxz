01:37.917 --> 01:39.041
Get a cab,

01:39.041 --> 01:40.875
You okay?
No, no, no, no.
What's she doing?

- What are you doing?
- Where do you live?

01:42.500 --> 01:43.875
Where do you
need to go, Hannah?

01:43.875 --> 01:45.375
Where does she live?
Okay, I'm gonna call Uber.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.166
My parents live
in Michigan.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.583
- Great.
- Taxi!

01:50.333 --> 01:52.291
This is it.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.250
Okay, you all right?

01:54.250 --> 01:56.583
Let me just
close the door.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.959
- All right.
- I just have to
use the bathroom.

01:58.959 --> 02:01.333
- Yeah, it's--
- And then we can
have a conversation.

02:01.333 --> 02:04.625
Okay, well,
it's right over there.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.959
- Get it all out.
- ( spits )

02:06.959 --> 02:09.000
- I'm sorry.
- No, this--

02:09.000 --> 02:10.917
I didn't even have
that much stuff to drink.

02:10.917 --> 02:14.125
Yeah, but maybe
your tolerance isn't as--

02:14.125 --> 02:15.583
It's not good.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.333
Yeah, all right.
Let's get you cleaned up, okay?

02:17.333 --> 02:20.458
- Let's get--
- I must smell so bad.
I'm so embarrassed.

02:20.458 --> 02:23.625
It's all right.
You smell fine.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.500
( coughs, spits )

02:25.500 --> 02:27.375
Okay, yeah,
drink that up.

02:27.375 --> 02:29.542
Drink it.
Drink it, drink it.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.125
( sputters )

02:31.125 --> 02:33.166
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.583
- Joe!
- Sorry!

02:34.583 --> 02:37.250
Joe, I just wanted
to thank you so much

02:37.250 --> 02:39.166
for taking such
good care of me.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.500
Of course.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.375
Of course, I would
do it for anybody.

02:43.375 --> 02:46.583
( music playing )

03:05.041 --> 03:07.458
So, are you in
for a little more?

03:07.458 --> 03:12.417
Because it's
an important investment
in our space's future.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.375
My appointment
just got here.

03:15.375 --> 03:18.458
Okay, love you.
Bye, Daddy.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.250
- Marnie, welcome.
- Soo Jin.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.667
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.375
Look at this space,
seriously.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.750
This is amazing.
It's right next to
Opening Ceremony.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.083
Opening Cemetery.
Their prices will be
the death of me.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.834
Sorry we're
in such disarray.

03:33.834 --> 03:36.917
- There just, like, aren't
enough hours in a day.
- Are you kidding?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.792
I can't be a woman
and a girlfriend

03:38.792 --> 03:41.708
and a gallerist
and an electronic musician
and all these things at once.

03:41.708 --> 03:44.000
It's too much for one person.
I love your beanie.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.834
Listen, I get it.
I didn't even know
all of those things

03:46.834 --> 03:48.208
could be in one person.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.834
- That's-- thank you.
- Yeah.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.792
Um, I just understand--

03:52.792 --> 03:54.125
mainly because
I'm trying to juggle--

03:54.125 --> 03:56.708
So, are you really
interested in a job?

03:56.708 --> 03:59.250
Oh, we're just gonna
do this right now.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.458
Yeah, okay, um...

04:01.458 --> 04:03.792
I find the idea
of being part

04:03.792 --> 04:06.834
of the start of a gallery
just so exciting--

04:06.834 --> 04:09.458
finding an archiving
system that works,

04:09.458 --> 04:11.291
establishing
a Web presence.

04:11.291 --> 04:12.625
Totally, all of that.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.917
I've been saying all along
that what I really need

04:14.917 --> 04:17.750
is an assistant
who's more qualified
than I am.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.166
Assistant?

04:19.166 --> 04:20.875
I mean, it's a really
small staff.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.625
My best homo friend Jeremy
is already gallery director,

04:23.625 --> 04:27.291
so, yeah, I thought
you'd start off
as an assistant--

04:27.291 --> 04:29.500
my assistant.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.792
- How old are you?
- Two-four, girl.

04:32.792 --> 04:35.041
But for the cred
and intrigue of the gallery,

04:35.041 --> 04:36.959
I'm gonna tell people
I'm 22.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.417
So, are you with me?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.000
Adam!

04:45.000 --> 04:47.417
- Adam, I'm so sorry.
- Where the fuck were you?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.750
I'm so, so,
so, so sorry.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.000
What happened?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.500
I got so drunk
and had to fall asleep

04:53.500 --> 04:54.834
at my friend
from work's place.

04:54.834 --> 04:58.667
It was so irresponsible.
I haven't acted that way,
like, ever.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.000
Well, did you have fun
with your work friends?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.375
I mean, I barfed.
Were you worried about me?

05:04.375 --> 05:05.625
Like, I slept
at Joe's house.

05:05.625 --> 05:10.750
He's a guy from my work
who's, you know, a guy.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.333
What do you think
about this, up or down?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.542
Not the bottom part, obviously.
It's rehearsal clothes.

05:14.542 --> 05:17.000
But this is the coat
that I'm actually gonna
wear during the show.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.333
They said I could take
it home and break it in
for a couple weeks,

05:19.333 --> 05:22.208
so I'm just gonna be
doing stuff I normally
do around the house

05:22.208 --> 05:24.834
like organizing
my newspapers

05:24.834 --> 05:26.959
and eating muffins
and going to the bathroom,

05:26.959 --> 05:28.792
I'm just gonna be
doing it in a coat.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.875
So, you think up or down
looks better?

05:30.875 --> 05:32.125
Down.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.500
Okay, that's what
I thought, too.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.667
( music playing )

05:41.750 --> 05:44.291
I got so clean for you.

05:44.291 --> 05:45.875
Oh, that must
feel nice.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.500
I was very sick
last night.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.708
- Come here.
- It's a miracle
I'm walking.

05:51.708 --> 05:54.083
Come here, silly.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.333
Come here, come here,
come here.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.708
Ooh, you do smell clean.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.291
I told you,
I'm very clean.

06:03.291 --> 06:05.166
Yeah.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.834
Mwah.

06:11.583 --> 06:14.417
- I love you.
- I love you.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.625
I love you.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.834
( groans )

06:24.834 --> 06:26.667
What?

06:26.667 --> 06:30.083
I don't want to get sticky
before rehearsal.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.542
Are you serious?

06:32.542 --> 06:34.917
Yeah, I have to leave
in a half an hour.

06:34.917 --> 06:38.792
Well, I wasn't
planning anything
that fucking complicated.

06:38.792 --> 06:41.959
Aw.

06:41.959 --> 06:44.291
- I still love you.
- I still love you.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.375
It's not a big deal.
Whatever.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.542
You still coming
to rehearsal?

06:47.542 --> 06:48.959
Yeah, of course.
Of course, of course.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.917
I have to-- I have
to go get dressed.

06:50.917 --> 06:51.959
All right.

06:51.959 --> 06:54.708
I'm obviously coming
to rehearsal.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.250
Now I lost my spot.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.417
- ( playing guitar )
- No, it's good.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.750
- Got any lyrics?
- Um...

07:14.750 --> 07:17.083
Anything you've
been working on?

07:17.083 --> 07:19.166
Yeah, I have
this journal

07:19.166 --> 07:22.375
where I just write
little, like, ideas
and thoughts down.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.083
- Oh, here,
let me see that.
- Oh.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.000
Fuck, you got
some darkness in you.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.834
A lot of that is stuff
I wrote on Ambien.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.083
Actually, you know what?
This is really--

07:36.083 --> 07:39.333
No, no, this is
actually really cool.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.041
This is actually
really beautiful.

that's wrong.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.000
No, it's not wrong.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.625
You just need to believe
in yourself a little bit.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.542

Jasper: You do realize
Rupert Murdoch owns

10:02.375 --> 10:04.041
even newspapers
he doesn't own.

10:04.041 --> 10:07.000
He's like the Godfather
of it all, and none of
the information we read

10:07.000 --> 10:09.083
can even make a mild claim
to objectivity.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.333
- I'd like to start
my own newspaper.
- You would?

10:11.333 --> 10:13.417
- One that told the truth
once in a while, you know?
- Yeah.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.333
- Just what was up
around the neighborhood.
- Yeah, neighborhood.

10:15.333 --> 10:19.083
You know, who died,
who started a garden,
you know?

10:19.083 --> 10:22.000
- And there will be no
photographs, only drawings.
- Only drawings.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.250
- And it would be called
"The Daily Truth."
- Yeah!

10:26.875 --> 10:29.542
- Isn't that fantastic?
- Yeah!

10:29.542 --> 10:31.417
- Yeah.
- Shoshanna!

10:31.417 --> 10:34.500
Sho-shanna!

10:34.500 --> 10:37.250
Hi, hi.
We just wanted

10:40.291 --> 10:42.208
Gotta see a man
about a horse, okay.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.333
I'll wedge the door open
so I can buzz myself.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.333
Ah, ah, ow,
fuck my cunt.

10:52.208 --> 10:55.917
Jesus, what
a sad, sad man.

10:55.917 --> 10:56.834
He has no one.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.417
His ex-wife remarried
a barrister.

10:59.417 --> 11:00.792
His daughter lives
right here in New York,

11:00.792 --> 11:02.875
but he's too scared
to even call her.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.208
He used to be
a very successful
hotelier.

11:05.208 --> 11:08.333
Now all he has
to show for it is
a box full of slippers.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.917
Don't tell him
I have this, okay?

11:09.917 --> 11:13.500

Whoa, easy there, mate.

11:16.417 --> 11:19.417
- She ain't doing you no harm.
- ( door opens )

11:19.417 --> 11:21.166
Who you calling mate?

11:21.166 --> 11:23.583
You wanna stand up
for her, do ya?

11:23.583 --> 11:24.959
Put up your hands.

11:24.959 --> 11:28.083
- Who are you?
- Hannah: Me?

11:28.083 --> 11:29.875
Oh, I'm Adam's
girlfriend.

11:29.875 --> 11:32.708
- Who?
- I'm Adam's girlfriend.

11:32.708 --> 11:34.458
Ahem.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.125
Why are you here?

11:38.125 --> 11:40.417
I'm here just to
check out rehearsal.

11:40.417 --> 11:44.166
No, we can't have anybody
watching rehearsals.
I'm sorry.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.959
Okay, well,
Adam mentioned

11:46.959 --> 11:49.250
that it would be good
for me to stop by.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.125
( normal accent )
Yeah, I mean, we
talked about this

11:51.125 --> 11:53.959
being a possibility,
Hannah.

11:53.959 --> 11:57.458
You know, I'm at work
and, you know...

11:57.458 --> 12:00.834
Hannah:
O-okay. Okay.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.000
All right.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.041
( car horns honking )

12:22.667 --> 12:24.417
That romance,
that mystery,
that thrill--

12:24.417 --> 12:26.041
- that goes.
- I gotcha.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.291
And you know
what you're left with?

12:27.291 --> 12:29.125
Trying to seduce him
when he just wants
you to leave

12:29.125 --> 12:31.792
so they can jerk off
and take the bus
to rehearsal.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.250
Ugh, the bus.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.792
There's nothing weird
or exciting about our
sexual life anymore.

12:36.792 --> 12:39.834
He's treating me like
an ottoman with a vagina.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.625
That's a disgusting image.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.542
( laughs )

12:42.542 --> 12:44.208
At the end of
my relationship with Pal,

12:44.208 --> 12:46.875
I thought he had just
totally lost interest
in my body.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.333
( muffled )
Are you serious?

12:48.333 --> 12:51.166
I was just, like,
part of his routine.

12:51.166 --> 12:53.000
And that made you feel
fucking terrible, right?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.917
Yeah, and also confused
because I'm so much more

12:55.917 --> 12:57.583
traditionally attractive
than he is.

12:57.583 --> 12:58.959
The thing about Adam
is, like,

12:58.959 --> 13:00.959
he's one of the best people
I've ever known.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.500
Is he?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.792
Yeah.

13:03.792 --> 13:05.583
Okay. I don't really
know him that well.

13:05.583 --> 13:08.166
He's hard to get to know,
but once you do
get to know him,

13:08.166 --> 13:09.417
you can't imagine
your life without him,

13:09.417 --> 13:13.041
and so I just know
I need to do something
that's gonna

13:13.041 --> 13:18.083
make him remember
why we love each other.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.375
You should fight for it,
if this is what you want.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.542
I'm just so sick
of talking.

13:22.542 --> 13:25.667
Well, then,
go do something.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.375
( phone chimes )

13:27.375 --> 13:28.667
Hey.

13:28.667 --> 13:29.917
Adam on phone:
Yo, on a quick break.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.458
I was wondering
if you wanted me
to pick up dinner.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.250
You know what?
I actually already
made a plan for us.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.375
Why don't you just meet me
at the Globe at 9:00?

13:38.375 --> 13:40.333
What kind of food
do they serve?

13:40.333 --> 13:43.375
It's not really a food plan,
so eat first, okay?

13:43.375 --> 13:47.208
- Okay. I gotta go.
- Okay, I love you, bye.

13:51.542 --> 13:53.959
Marnie on phone:
Yo, it's Marnie.
Leave me a message.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.667
Hey, Marn, it's me.
Weird question--

13:55.667 --> 13:57.291
can I borrow your apartment
for something?

13:57.291 --> 13:59.667
Please call me back
immediately.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.000
Thank you.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.750
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

14:03.750 --> 14:05.000
Why are we here?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.166
Shoshanna's gonna
buy us a steak.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.917
( gasps )
I'm gonna feed it to you
like a baby bird.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.458
( tweeting )

14:10.458 --> 14:12.041
You said the meat
would be waiting.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.750
Yeah, you said that.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.583
Okay, so this isn't
actually about food.

14:15.583 --> 14:18.750
There can be food,
but it's not about food.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.166
Daddy?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.625
Dottie?

14:21.625 --> 14:23.083
Surprise!

14:23.083 --> 14:24.834
Hello.

14:24.834 --> 14:28.250
- Hi, I'm Dot.
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

14:28.250 --> 14:30.083
You know this
is not a good idea.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.250
- How did you find me?
- I found her.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.333
I told her to come.
You need help.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.834
- ( sneezes )
- Shoshanna: Bless you.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.458
I can't afford
to get ill right now.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.583
We have travel plans.
We're leaving.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.291
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.834
I'm not contagious.
My allergies are just
acting up.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.792
So is her psoriasis.
Look, it's stress-related.

14:46.792 --> 14:49.125
I'm looking at you, Dad,
and I've seen this before.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.792
Your eyes look like
tiny mouse holes.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.959
How old is she, Dad?

14:54.959 --> 14:57.458
I'd love to know
she has at least
six months on me.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.625
Please don't
talk about me like
I'm not even fucking here.

14:59.625 --> 15:02.875
- Please, please, please.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I am 47 years old.

15:02.875 --> 15:05.041
I deserve a little
more respect.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.417
She's hilarious as well.

15:07.417 --> 15:10.041
See?
See what this does?
What I do to you?

15:10.041 --> 15:13.041
This is what I do to you,
which is why you can't
be around me.

15:13.041 --> 15:16.792
- You have to go.
- That is the worst excuse
in the world.

15:16.792 --> 15:21.083
I should know,
you've been using it
on and off since I was six.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.000
This is not happening to me.
This is not happening to me.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.750

I'm sorry, I feel

16:33.500 --> 16:36.583
My husband, Marfaniel,
was stuck at work.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.834
He's always stuck at work,
it seems, these days,

16:38.834 --> 16:42.083
and here I am with the vodka
I ordered for him.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.417
Would you like it?

16:43.417 --> 16:46.375
No.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.667
Thank you.
I don't drink.

16:49.667 --> 16:53.542
Adam, it's water.
I don't want to have
to explain every part of it.

16:53.542 --> 16:57.333
Would you like
Jardaniel's drink?

16:59.834 --> 17:02.166
Oh, yes.

17:03.708 --> 17:05.625
Is there a straw?

17:05.625 --> 17:09.083
May I be so bold
as to ask what sorts
of women interest you?

17:09.083 --> 17:11.791
Married sluts like you.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.750
Are you on crack?

17:15.750 --> 17:17.625
I'm a married older woman!

17:17.625 --> 17:20.333
I have a child your age!

17:20.333 --> 17:21.916
Fuck!

17:24.290 --> 17:25.750
Fuck!

17:25.750 --> 17:28.416
No one talks to me
like that but my husband.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.792
Why are you in a bar
acting like a little slut?

17:30.792 --> 17:31.959
Slut? Get real.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.333
Shut the fuck up.
We're going back
to my place.

17:34.333 --> 17:37.083
Don't touch me.
Let me go.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.667
Let me go!

17:39.667 --> 17:41.333
Excuse me, miss.
Are you okay?

17:41.333 --> 17:42.458
What's going on?
Are you all right?

17:42.458 --> 17:43.959
- No.
- No, no, no,
this is my--

17:43.959 --> 17:45.458
( laughs )
This is my girlfriend.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.750
( heavy New York accent )
I have never seen this
guy in my entire life.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.875
We're fucking around
and this is my girlfriend.
We're just fucking around.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.458
He's been following me
down the street and
he grabs my tits.

17:53.458 --> 17:54.917
I don't know him.
I'm freaking out.

17:54.917 --> 17:56.917
I'm gonna call the cops,
seriously, if you don't
leave the lady alone.

17:56.917 --> 17:59.417
- Do, he's been harassing me.
- Sir, with all due respect,
just fuck off, please?

17:59.417 --> 18:00.542
I can't be the first woman
he's done this to.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.000
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.542
Please don't punch
my boyfriend.

18:03.542 --> 18:04.917
What the fuck
you talking about?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.834
Break up with her.
She's a fucking psycho.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.208
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.500
- Fuck!
- Are you okay?

18:09.500 --> 18:10.875
Did it hurt?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.959
Did it hurt
your big old head?

18:12.959 --> 18:16.500
- ( laughs )
- I'm so sorry.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.083
- Listen, Dot-- Dottie.
- Don't-- shh.

18:19.083 --> 18:22.708
I know you think
your father has a disease.

18:22.708 --> 18:24.000
I don't have a disease.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.750
- Like cancer.
- I don't have cancer.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.166
And that he needs
all the help

18:27.166 --> 18:29.208
and all the support
and love he can get

18:29.208 --> 18:31.125
so he can become
himself again.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.166
I am myself.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.291
- Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah.

18:34.291 --> 18:35.625
Oh, Dottie, don't itch.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.375
I heard that it makes it worse.
I read that on the Internet.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.750
- Is it contagious?
- It's not contagious.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.417
For Pete's
fucking sake, Dad.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.500
Why didn't you tell me
you were in the city?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.166
Because he's a bum.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.708
He told you that
himself.

18:47.708 --> 18:51.917
Right now he is,
but you can't imagine
how beautiful he can be.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.041
He'd never show you.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.250
He trains hounds.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.667
No, he doesn't.

18:57.667 --> 18:58.834
- He fishes.
- You train--

18:58.834 --> 19:01.083
- Yes, I do.
- He hunts, he sings...

19:01.083 --> 19:04.208
- Like, dogs?
- He wakes up early
to get papers and muffins.

19:04.208 --> 19:08.041
He watches foreign films
with me and does
all the voices.

19:08.041 --> 19:11.417
He explains the universe
so that black holes
sound cool, not scary.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.750
- You don't want to see me.
- Shoshanna: No, she does.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.291
She really, really does.

19:15.291 --> 19:18.125
She misses you so, so much.
She told me so herself.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.792
What the fuck
is wrong with you,
Shoshanna?

19:19.792 --> 19:21.041
Don't shout, don't shout.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.041
Nothing's fucking wrong with me.
What's wrong with you?

19:23.041 --> 19:27.083
Seriously, Dottie graduated
cum laude from Barnard.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.917
She works at
a travel book company.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.166
She does magical
singing on the side.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.708
She's dating an Egyptian,
so she's, like,

19:32.708 --> 19:34.458
super knowledgeable
about what's going on there.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.333
She is an incredibly
inspiring person.

19:41.208 --> 19:42.667
An Egyptian?

19:42.667 --> 19:44.792
This is hopeless,
as usual.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.208
Thank you
for your fucking time.

19:46.208 --> 19:49.542
I'm off to blow my nose
incessantly somewhere
more private.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.667
Oh, no, please, please.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.667
Pretend you never
saw me like this.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.917
Please.

19:55.917 --> 19:58.083
Do you have any idea
what it's like

19:58.083 --> 20:01.750
not having a clue
where you are for
the last two months?

20:01.750 --> 20:03.250
Haven't you gone
through this enough?

20:03.250 --> 20:05.000
I mean, haven't you
had enough of this?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.417
Aren't you just sick
and tired of all this

20:07.417 --> 20:09.000
that you've had
to put up with?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.291
No.

20:10.291 --> 20:11.750
Well, I gave up
on my father months ago.

20:11.750 --> 20:15.500
- Shh.
- Well, he was an absolute
fucking asshole.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.750
- Please.
- No.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.667
You're my father.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.917
Please let me help you.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.291
How?

20:26.291 --> 20:27.625
Get rid of her.

20:27.625 --> 20:28.959
No, we can't
get rid of her.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.125
- She'll be fine.
- I can't get rid of Jessa.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.417
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

20:32.417 --> 20:33.834
- Yes, you can.
- No, I love her.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.875
- Shoshanna's gonna
look after Jessa.
- Are you?

20:36.875 --> 20:38.959
I don't mind
drug addicts.

20:38.959 --> 20:40.708
I have all sorts
of friends,

20:40.708 --> 20:44.625
but she just--
Daddy, she doesn't seem
like a very nice girl.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.708
Oh, no, she's
a very nice girl.

20:46.708 --> 20:52.000
Well-- well, I hope
she can find the help
she needs.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.792
Fuck.

20:53.792 --> 20:56.250
- ( lock turns )
- ( keys jingling )

21:00.291 --> 21:05.000
This is quite a shithole for
a hedge fund manager's wife.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.291
Well, it's just where
my husband puts me up.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.333
It's his pied-à-terre.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.208
Whose apartment
is this?

21:12.208 --> 21:14.000
I told you,
it's my husband's pied--

21:14.000 --> 21:16.458
No, Hannah,
this is Marnie's, right?

21:16.458 --> 21:17.708
Smells like Marnie's.

21:17.708 --> 21:20.834
Smells like cookies
and air freshener.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.000
Who's Marnie?
You think I want to hear

21:23.000 --> 21:25.333
about your former flames
at a time like this

21:25.333 --> 21:28.500
when you've dragged me here
against my goddamn will?

21:28.500 --> 21:32.208
I told you, this is where
my husband puts me.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.041
He worries
about me, a lot.

21:35.041 --> 21:37.875
So he left some stuff for me
so I wouldn't get into trouble.

21:37.875 --> 21:41.542
Strawberries,
champagne, a dildo,

21:41.542 --> 21:45.291
which I already destroyed
through overuse.

21:45.291 --> 21:48.792
He was scared I'd get bored
and go out lookin' for trouble.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.834
And I did get bored.
And I did get into trouble.

21:51.834 --> 21:55.166
And now I find myself
in quite a pickle.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.291
Do you have a knife?

21:57.291 --> 21:59.625
You mean a knife
like this?

21:59.625 --> 22:02.041
( gasps theatrically )

22:02.041 --> 22:03.875
You know what I mean.

22:03.875 --> 22:06.041
Now cut to the chase.
What are you gonna do to me?

22:06.041 --> 22:09.625
- Show me what's
under your clothes.
- No.

22:09.625 --> 22:13.708
Not now, not ever.

22:17.250 --> 22:21.333
Don't force me to do this.
It's just my underpants.

22:23.917 --> 22:27.750
Jesus fucking Christ.
You look like a Christmas tree.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.959
- Skirt, too.
- It's humiliating...

22:30.959 --> 22:34.458
to show off my house
underwear like this.

22:35.417 --> 22:37.667
You're so demanding.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.834
Crawl on the bed.

22:52.125 --> 22:56.083
Do you want me
to eat all the foods?

22:56.083 --> 22:59.166
Put a berry
in your mouth.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.166
Swallow it whole.
You can't just have part.

23:03.166 --> 23:06.708
- ( glasses clink )
- I'm afraid to eat
the green part.

23:06.708 --> 23:10.375
Swallow it whole.
You can't just have part.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.458
Very hard to do.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.333
No.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.625
That's the thing
I swore would never happen.

23:26.375 --> 23:29.667
From now on, the rule is

23:29.667 --> 23:32.458
you can't just have part.

23:32.458 --> 23:36.792
You have to take
the whole thing or nothing.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.667
I sure as hell
hope you're happy.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.333
You look like a junkie.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.583
I am a junkie.

24:22.166 --> 24:25.500
( keys jingle )

24:25.500 --> 24:27.959
( door opens )

24:32.208 --> 24:34.875
I usually fuck
football players,

24:34.875 --> 24:37.792
but now I'm fucking
the school weirdo.

24:37.792 --> 24:39.250
The school weirdo?

24:39.250 --> 24:43.875
And I'm a cheerleader
and you thought so much
about fucking me before.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.875
I thought you were
a hedge fund manager's wife.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.208
No, no, I'm Kim,

24:48.208 --> 24:50.166
and I usually fuck
football players,

24:50.166 --> 24:53.917
but it turns out
the school weirdo
has an even bigger dick

24:53.917 --> 24:56.792
than a football player,
you fucking weirdo.

24:56.792 --> 24:59.166
I'm not the fucking
school weirdo.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.333
What?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.250
You can't change roles
in the middle of everything.

25:03.250 --> 25:07.750
It doesn't make
any fucking narrative sense.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.375
Okay, so now that
you're in a play,

25:09.375 --> 25:11.834
you're, like, the expert
on what makes narrative sense?

25:11.834 --> 25:14.500
- Hannah, what the fuck?
- I'm a writer, too, you know.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.458
What?

25:16.458 --> 25:18.250
I was trying to do
something you'd like,

25:18.250 --> 25:20.083
like have sex
the way that we used to.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.583
Why are you getting
so mad at me?

25:21.583 --> 25:23.083
What do you mean,
"the way we used to"?

25:23.083 --> 25:25.083
You don't like
the way we do it now?

25:25.083 --> 25:26.583
I mean, do you?

25:26.583 --> 25:28.417
You used to have
all these ideas about me

25:28.417 --> 25:29.917
being, like,
a little street slut

25:29.917 --> 25:31.417
or, like, an orphan
with a disease

25:31.417 --> 25:35.875
or you said I was, like,
a woman with a baby's body
or something.

25:35.875 --> 25:38.750
I was just trying to do it
the way that we used to,

25:38.750 --> 25:40.083
the way that sex
always was for us.

25:40.083 --> 25:42.917
It wasn't all creepy
and thought through
like this.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.792
It was just coming
to us in the moment.

25:44.792 --> 25:47.250
I don't have
ideas like that.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.041
I was just doing
your ideas.

25:49.041 --> 25:51.583
I was just doing sex
the way you wanted to.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.083
Jesus, Hannah, fuck.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.250
The second I come,
I have no fucking idea
what I said.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.542
I'm not planning
anything.

25:57.542 --> 25:59.125
But you were
outside yourself.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.291
You were outside your body
watching everything.

26:02.291 --> 26:03.375
So?

26:03.375 --> 26:04.708
What does it matter?

26:04.708 --> 26:06.291
If you're getting
what you want,

26:06.291 --> 26:08.375
what do you care
if I'm, like, in my body?

26:08.375 --> 26:10.625
You can't be, like,
the body police.

26:10.625 --> 26:14.083
( scoffs )
You have an old idea
of who I am.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.959
Sex was the thing
that kept me from
drinking.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.083
That's why I fucked women
I met in bars or whatever.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.750
Was it like that
with all of them?

26:19.750 --> 26:22.417
Like, the games and the ideas
and the being different?

26:22.417 --> 26:23.750
Fuck, yeah.
Yes, it was.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.500
And it was with us
for a while, too.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.000
But then
we fell in love,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.834
and then I just
wanted to have sex
with just you as us.

26:29.834 --> 26:33.667
Just fuck and be sweet
or whatever.

26:35.375 --> 26:38.708
If the sex we were having
wasn't working for you,
I'm fucking sorry.

26:38.708 --> 26:41.125
I didn't realize
I was disappointing
you so badly.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.000
That's not what I mean.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.500
- Was it not?
- No.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.959
You think I'm some
angry fucking sociopath

26:45.959 --> 26:47.500
who wants to meet
older women in bars

26:47.500 --> 26:49.125
and intimidate them
into fucking me?

26:49.125 --> 26:52.041
Because I can do that,
but I have a job to do now,
and I'm trying to focus,

26:52.041 --> 26:54.542
and I'm not here
to fill up your life
with fucking stories

26:54.542 --> 26:55.667
for your fucking Twitter.

26:55.667 --> 26:58.166
I get it.
I have a job, too.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.250
It's not the same thing.

27:01.250 --> 27:05.250
Really?
That's crazy.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.875
( groans )
I can't do this.
I have to focus.

27:10.875 --> 27:13.291
Ray said I could
stay with him
for a while.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.708
Wait, what?

27:17.708 --> 27:19.375
You're gonna go stay
with Ray for a while?

27:19.375 --> 27:20.750
Just through
the rehearsal process

27:20.750 --> 27:22.208
so I can just think
about the play

27:22.208 --> 27:24.375
and not have to deal
with all this drama.

27:24.375 --> 27:27.500
What drama?
This is just me.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.250
Exactly.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.834
I don't get it.
You didn't even care
about the play.

27:33.834 --> 27:36.208
Well, but here's the thing.

27:36.208 --> 27:38.708
I did.
I always did.
I do.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.750
It feels amazing
to finally care
about something.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.708
It feels amazing and scary,
and I'll always regret it

27:44.708 --> 27:48.291
if I don't give myself
a chance to just do it
all the way.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.250
You sound like
you're in, like,
"Field of Dreams."

27:50.250 --> 27:53.291
Well, it--
it's not a joke to me.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.792
I didn't say it was.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.125
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Hannah, fuck.
