that makes me a bad mum?

Yes.

you went out partying

looking after our daughter, huh?

just so we're on the same page,

is that the Earth is flat,

14:54.688 --> 14:56.207

14:56.286 --> 14:59.565

was how much I would miss this.

24:17.127 --> 24:21.284
I think sometimes you have
to make new friends to realise,

24:21.365 --> 24:25.283
"Oh, no, maybe my old friends
are better."

24:27.162 --> 24:29.161
Even if we've changed.

24:32.759 --> 24:35.638
Anyways, I'm not gonna be
in town for much longer,

24:35.717 --> 24:38.196
so everybody think of
one nice thing to say to me.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.115
Be specific.

-Crowd goes wild.

24:42.514 --> 24:44.713
(GUESTS CHEER)

24:48.431 --> 24:50.270
I never thought
I'd be back here.

24:50.350 --> 24:52.109
I thought I was leaving forever.

24:52.188 --> 24:55.986
Yeah. I never thought I'd donate
my sperm to Talia, but I did.

24:56.067 --> 24:58.066
Life's crazy, huh?

24:58.866 --> 25:00.465
What?

25:00.544 --> 25:03.184
Yeah, nah, Talia
and her girlfriend

25:03.264 --> 25:05.263
asked me for some help
and I said yes.

25:07.222 --> 25:09.221
Did you?

25:09.899 --> 25:11.779
How cool.

25:11.859 --> 25:14.818
To have a baby with Talia.

25:14.898 --> 25:16.377
Talia's girlfriend.

25:16.456 --> 25:18.456
Talia's
girlfriend.

25:19.774 --> 25:22.254
How absolutely exciting.

25:22.334 --> 25:24.332
You reckon?

25:24.893 --> 25:26.892
You're the only person
I've told so far.

25:28.011 --> 25:30.050
-You haven't told Alicia?
-Ayesha.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.489
No. It's early days, so...

25:35.608 --> 25:39.086
Wow. That's great.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.205
That's great.

25:41.284 --> 25:43.923
If that's what you want.

25:44.003 --> 25:46.282
It's easy for me.

25:46.361 --> 25:48.360
It'll make them happy.

25:50.440 --> 25:54.758
I dropped out of uni.
And I got divorced.

25:57.037 --> 25:58.755
Ouch. Really?

25:58.836 --> 26:00.195
Yeah.

26:00.274 --> 26:02.194
That's intense.

26:02.274 --> 26:04.832
It's good.
I mean, it's not good.

26:04.913 --> 26:06.912
But it's good.

26:07.552 --> 26:09.311
Really?

26:09.390 --> 26:10.830
Yeah.

26:10.909 --> 26:13.549
It turns out doing everything
you're supposed to do

26:13.629 --> 26:16.746
and getting everything
you wanted can suck.

26:19.466 --> 26:22.543
So...is that why
you're not going back?

26:25.423 --> 26:27.422
Who told you I'm not going back?

26:30.220 --> 26:32.219
Don't tell anyone.

26:35.498 --> 26:37.497
Oly's lucky to have you.

26:38.735 --> 26:40.735
Not everyone gets a Reema.
