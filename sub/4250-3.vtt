20:14.171 --> 20:16.089
- I KNOW.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.300
I DID ENJOY THE CHALLENGE
IT GAVE ME, THOUGH.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.635
- WELL, HERE'S A CHALLENGE:

20:19.718 --> 20:20.844
WE NEED TO REFORM SIBUNA.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.137
VICTOR'S
UP TO SOMETHING AGAIN.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.889
- WHAT?

20:23.972 --> 20:27.643
- AND THIS IS THE BIT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.145
IT'S ABOUT YOUR BRACELET.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.688
IT BELONGS TO VICTOR.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.316
- OH, ALFIE,
THIS ISN'T EVEN HIS COLOR.

20:38.236 --> 20:41.740
OKAY, SO YOU BOUGHT IT FROM HIM.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.451
- NOT QUITE.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.830
- AH, TRUDY, HAS THE--

20:48.914 --> 20:50.874
- YES, THE MAIL HAS ARRIVED.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.292
NO, THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.335
- ARE YOU SURE?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.503
THERE HAS TO BE.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.756
IF IT MEANS SOMEONE
MUST HAVE TAKEN IT--

20:57.839 --> 20:59.216
THEY MUST HAVE DONE.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.135
- WELL, SOME PARCELS ARRIVED
FOR AMBER'S BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.512
- YES?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.138
- AND JEROME AND MARA HID THEM.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.932
AND AMBER OPENED THEM
LAST NIGHT.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.225
WELL, I SUPPOSE
IT IS POSSIBLE...

21:08.308 --> 21:11.520
- THAT MY PARCEL
HAS GOT MIXED UP WITH THOSE.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.772
- NO.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.399
BECAUSE MARA AND AMBER
WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT

21:15.482 --> 21:16.358
AS SOON AS THEY REALIZED,
WOULDN'T THEY?

21:16.441 --> 21:18.694
- YOU HAVE FAR TOO HIGH
AN OPINION

21:18.777 --> 21:20.570
OF THE STUDENTS AT THIS SCHOOL,
TRUDY.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.739
IT IS A FLAW
IN YOUR PERSONALITY.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.661
- ALFIE,
BUT I LOVE THIS BRACELET.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.371
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
IT'S WHAT?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.664
- AN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ARTIFACT.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.873
- BELONGING TO VICTOR?
GREAT.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.667
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.252
- WHAT?

21:35.335 --> 21:38.964
- WELL, STEALING BRACELETS
FROM VICTOR TO GIVE TO ME,

21:39.047 --> 21:42.134
I FEEL LIKE
I DON'T KNOW YOU AT ALL.

21:44.177 --> 21:47.723
SO WHERE IS THIS NOTE ANYWAY?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.141
- OH, HERE IT IS.

21:49.224 --> 21:52.394
IT WAS TAPED TO THE PACKAGING.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.062
AND IT'S ADDRESSED
TO THE KEEPER,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.523
THE SEEKER, AND THE ENABLER.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.525
YOU GOT TO ADMIT
THAT'S WEIRD.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.028
- YOU DO REALIZE
VICTOR'S GOING TO COME

22:01.111 --> 22:02.154
LOOKING FOR THIS BRACELET,
RIGHT?

22:02.237 --> 22:05.282
AND WHEN HE DOES,
I NEED TO HAND IT OVER

22:05.365 --> 22:06.908
AND LEAVE YOU
TO DO THE EXPLAINING.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.577
[knocking at door]

22:08.660 --> 22:10.245
- AMBER MILLINGTON.

22:10.328 --> 22:12.581
I WANT A WORD WITH YOU.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.790
I'M COMING IN.
