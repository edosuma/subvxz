to assassinate Riggs. All good."

09:55.891 --> 09:57.460

14:36.652 --> 14:38.255
Cold, and...

14:39.156 --> 14:41.227
...void of love, you know?

Oh, Lord,

14:50.112 --> 14:51.649

asking me to do?

Just don't be all shrinky,
just for once, say it.

14:55.088 --> 14:57.092
I'm asking you
to forgive yourself.

14:57.092 --> 14:59.096
For what?

14:59.096 --> 15:00.667
I didn't do anything,
I was a kid.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.004
Exactly.

15:03.004 --> 15:05.442
You had a gun pointed
at your father,

15:05.442 --> 15:08.549
you had the chance to shoot him,
and you did nothing.

15:08.549 --> 15:09.651
Why?

15:32.196 --> 15:33.799
I mean, he was
supposed to protect me.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.102
But he didn't.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.206

No.

15:44.086 --> 15:47.226
And every day since then, I...

15:51.300 --> 15:55.308
Every day since then,
I regret not killing his ass.

16:00.419 --> 16:05.663
But until you forgive yourself,
you'll never have the peace

16:05.663 --> 16:08.803

with yourself, and with Molly.

one conversation,

how it all works?

but maybe this will.

Oh, nothing.
Nothing you need to worry about.

just out of curiosity,

20:10.653 --> 20:12.489
you didn't try to kill me
this morning, did you?

20:12.489 --> 20:14.493
No, but I'm just about to.

20:14.493 --> 20:16.932

Hey.

21:18.454 --> 21:19.757
Who tried to kill me?

21:20.959 --> 21:22.797
Hey! Was it Nathan Riggs?

21:22.797 --> 21:23.799
Was it my dad?

21:23.799 --> 21:25.168
(mumbling):
It wasn't...

21:25.168 --> 21:26.538
What?

21:26.538 --> 21:27.840
It wasn't you.

21:45.976 --> 21:47.513

21:47.513 --> 21:49.517
Rog, it wasn't me.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.721

21:57.967 --> 22:00.973
MURTAUGH:
So I guess this means

22:00.973 --> 22:03.645
I'm not gonna get
the chocolate fountain?

22:06.518 --> 22:08.655
Surprise.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.573
Uh‐uh‐uh‐uh‐uh.

22:17.573 --> 22:20.077
Do not touch that rug.

22:20.077 --> 22:23.184
That's a limited edition
microfiber. Put it back.

22:23.184 --> 22:26.023
Murtaugh, there's blood
and human viscera on it.

22:26.023 --> 22:28.562
That's nothing a little seltzer
can't handle.

22:28.562 --> 22:30.632
(phone ringing)
Seltzer?
Yeah.

22:30.632 --> 22:33.070
Hey, Trish.

22:33.070 --> 22:36.844
Oh, God, Roger.
Are you all right?

22:36.844 --> 22:40.586
Baby, my heart is racing.

22:40.586 --> 22:42.288
I could feel the bullets
whizzing by my head.

22:42.288 --> 22:44.660
What if you were home
or the kids?

22:44.660 --> 22:45.294
We weren't.

22:45.294 --> 22:47.098
The kids are with my aunt.

22:47.098 --> 22:48.033
They're perfectly safe.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.973
God, I'm just glad we're done
with this.

22:50.973 --> 22:52.743
With what?

22:52.743 --> 22:54.780
All of it. Everyday worry

22:54.780 --> 22:55.716
that you're in the field,

22:55.716 --> 22:57.151
constantly putting your life
on the line.

22:57.151 --> 22:58.320
All of it.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.759
Yeah.

23:00.759 --> 23:01.961
It's over.

23:01.961 --> 23:04.567
I just got to head back
to the precinct

23:04.567 --> 23:06.003
to make a list of the suspects.

23:06.003 --> 23:07.038
You know?
Okay.

23:07.038 --> 23:08.775
I'm leaving the office now.

23:08.775 --> 23:09.977
I'm on my way.
Okay.

23:09.977 --> 23:13.718
(chuckles)
Hey, baby.

23:13.718 --> 23:15.856
It's 12:01.

23:15.856 --> 23:18.628
You're not a detective anymore.

23:18.628 --> 23:20.666
You made it.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.736
Yeah.

23:22.736 --> 23:23.972
I made it.

23:23.972 --> 23:26.076
See you, baby.

23:32.021 --> 23:36.864
(man speaking softly nearby)

23:36.864 --> 23:38.601
...$2 million right now.

23:38.601 --> 23:41.039
(quietly): Alan, what are you
still doing here?

23:41.039 --> 23:42.141
ALAN:
Even if I wanted to,

23:42.141 --> 23:43.778
I couldn't get you
the money tonight.

23:43.778 --> 23:44.980
NATHAN:
Why is that?

23:44.980 --> 23:46.350
ALAN: Because I don't have
access to the accounts, okay?

23:46.350 --> 23:48.755
Only Trish Murtaugh does.

23:48.755 --> 23:50.124
Murtaugh?

23:50.124 --> 23:51.159
Her husband a cop?

23:51.159 --> 23:52.061
Yeah. And she changed
her passwords this morning.

23:52.061 --> 23:55.034
So I'm gonna need
a little more time.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.340
If Trish can get me the money,
what do I need you for?

23:58.340 --> 24:00.612
ALAN: Whoa, hey, what's with the
gun?! I said I'd get it for you.

24:00.612 --> 24:02.181
I just need a day...
(gunshot)

24:07.626 --> 24:09.262
(door opens)

24:09.262 --> 24:11.266
RIGGS: Scrapbooking
on company time again.

24:11.266 --> 24:14.072
You know the department
frowns on that.

24:14.072 --> 24:16.778
I'm going through some old case
files looking for suspects.

24:16.778 --> 24:18.313
Any luck?
Nah.

24:18.313 --> 24:21.119
But my first order as captain

24:21.119 --> 24:24.058
is to rename this
the Murtaugh Wing.

24:24.058 --> 24:27.331
Put away a lot of bad guys,
buddy.

24:27.331 --> 24:29.937
Mm‐hmm.
And there's always more.

24:29.937 --> 24:32.943
Well, that's the
gig, isn't it?

24:32.943 --> 24:35.314
Not for me. Not anymore.

24:35.314 --> 24:37.351
Someone almost took me out
tonight

24:37.351 --> 24:40.090
and I‐I can't escape
this feeling that...

24:40.090 --> 24:42.963
What?

24:42.963 --> 24:48.040
...that being captain puts me
one foot closer to the grave

24:48.040 --> 24:49.643
than any bullet ever could.

24:51.379 --> 24:55.321
Well...
(clears throat)

24:55.321 --> 24:58.628
If it's any consolation...

25:00.431 --> 25:02.034
...there's not a cop
in this building

25:02.034 --> 25:03.103
that doesn't respect you.

25:03.103 --> 25:05.374
Thanks, man.

25:05.374 --> 25:09.817
And it only took you two years
and a one‐way ticket out of here

25:09.817 --> 25:12.789
to open up.

25:12.789 --> 25:14.827
You still going?

25:14.827 --> 25:16.831
I don't know.

25:16.831 --> 25:18.033
What? Why not?

25:18.033 --> 25:22.843
Hard to move forward, Rog,
when you can't let things go.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.888
I get it.

25:28.888 --> 25:30.391
You can't leave me behind.

25:30.391 --> 25:34.265
Perfectly understandable.

25:34.265 --> 25:36.002
That's not what I said.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.873
Your‐your mouth
is not saying it,

25:37.873 --> 25:39.743
but your eyes are
telling me everything.

25:39.743 --> 25:42.415
Mm. What are my eyes
telling you right now?

25:42.415 --> 25:46.389
They're saying,
"I love you, man."

25:46.389 --> 25:47.491
You're delusional.
You know,

25:47.491 --> 25:49.964
if you make someone say
they love you, it's not...

25:49.964 --> 25:52.468
Guys.
(chatter quiets)

25:52.468 --> 25:54.205
You need to see this.

25:54.205 --> 25:56.076
Records from the
hitter's burner phone.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.278
Several calls
from a law firm.

25:57.278 --> 25:58.848
What firm?

25:58.848 --> 25:59.950
Your wife's.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.160
<i>(elevator bell chimes)</i>

26:05.160 --> 26:07.866
She's still not answering
her phone.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.268
(phone ringing nearby)

26:09.268 --> 26:11.139
Wait. I hear it ringing.

26:11.139 --> 26:13.276
(phone ringing)

26:17.184 --> 26:19.389
MURTAUGH: She was
recording something.

26:19.389 --> 26:20.959
Stay in there, Rog!

26:20.959 --> 26:22.461
ALAN: I don't have access
to the accounts, okay?

26:22.461 --> 26:24.900
Only Trish Murtaugh does.
Riggs.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.038
Riggs!

26:27.038 --> 26:28.206
It's your dad!

26:28.206 --> 26:30.177
What?

26:30.177 --> 26:32.148
He's got her.

26:32.148 --> 26:34.285
What the hell is he doing
with my wife?!

26:34.285 --> 26:36.056
I don't know, Rog.
Look, just calm down.

26:36.056 --> 26:37.959
What the hell is happening?!

26:37.959 --> 26:41.032
I don't know, Rog, but obviously
he needs something from her.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.168
We'll get her back.
How?

26:42.168 --> 26:43.971
You gonna call him?
You gonna talk to him?

26:43.971 --> 26:44.940
No, you can't call him.

26:44.940 --> 26:46.409
Riggs, this is Trish.
He's not gonna listen.

26:46.409 --> 26:50.350
So then what? What?!

26:53.223 --> 26:55.327
He took something
you love.

26:55.327 --> 26:58.333
We take something
from him.

27:00.104 --> 27:03.276
NATHAN: <i>I need $2 million</i>
<i>transferred into my account.</i>

27:03.276 --> 27:06.182
TRISH:
All this time,

27:06.182 --> 27:09.489
Alan was laundering money.

27:09.489 --> 27:11.326
He put out the hit
on my husband.

27:11.326 --> 27:14.398
NATHAN: Hey.
Quit stalling.

27:14.398 --> 27:16.837
Are you gonna kill me
after I make this transfer?

27:16.837 --> 27:19.710
Would knowing
make it any better?

27:24.218 --> 27:26.222
No.

27:26.222 --> 27:27.726
(typing)

27:45.995 --> 27:48.835
It's done.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.005
Well, I guess we're all
finished here, boys.

27:51.005 --> 27:53.043
Let's make a move.

27:53.043 --> 27:55.882
Step out of the car.

28:01.961 --> 28:04.867
Turn around.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.302
Turn around!

28:06.302 --> 28:09.242
You don't have to do this.

28:09.242 --> 28:12.414
Please, I...

28:12.414 --> 28:17.157
(crying): I have children
and a husband.

28:17.157 --> 28:18.861
It's not personal.

28:18.861 --> 28:21.132
You just got caught
in the middle of something.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.452
Son?

28:31.452 --> 28:32.923
RIGGS:
Hey, Pop.

28:32.923 --> 28:34.225
How you doing?

28:34.225 --> 28:35.360
What the hell are you doing,
Martin?

28:35.360 --> 28:38.935
Ah, just thought it was time
for a little family reunion.

28:58.306 --> 29:00.110
Hey, Riggs.

29:00.110 --> 29:01.814
I know, Rog.

29:03.584 --> 29:06.322
The only thing that matters
is getting Trish back.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.904
(sniffs)

29:25.360 --> 29:27.464
Let's talk inside.

29:43.329 --> 29:47.438
Love what you've done
with the place.

29:47.438 --> 29:50.177
Let's just get this
over with, all right?

29:50.177 --> 29:52.381
Thought we might
have a drink first.

29:52.381 --> 29:54.653
I don't do that anymore.

29:54.653 --> 29:56.623
Make an exception.

29:56.623 --> 30:00.263
Might be the last time
we see each other.

30:00.263 --> 30:02.201
I'll be sure to
celebrate after.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.006
Suit yourself.

30:06.075 --> 30:08.012
Here's to family.

30:10.518 --> 30:13.289
Now...

30:13.289 --> 30:15.327
let's talk terms.

30:15.327 --> 30:19.001
Trish for Garrett.
Nothing to discuss.

30:19.001 --> 30:21.139
There is one thing.

30:21.139 --> 30:23.978
When we leave here today...

30:23.978 --> 30:25.313
you won't come after us.

30:27.251 --> 30:29.421
That's a big ask.

30:29.421 --> 30:32.094
I'm not asking.

30:32.094 --> 30:33.631
I'm telling.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.335
How's that?

30:36.335 --> 30:41.279
Well, you got to think
about that girl of yours.

30:41.279 --> 30:44.151
Molly and her son.

30:46.222 --> 30:49.461
The thing is, son...

30:49.461 --> 30:54.371
I can get to them
any time I want.

30:54.371 --> 30:56.475
Any time.

31:00.283 --> 31:02.321
Now you want that drink?

31:05.093 --> 31:06.329
Easy, Riggs.

31:06.329 --> 31:08.466
