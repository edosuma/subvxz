IN THE MIDDLE OF MOVING.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.585
AND IT WAS REALLY CONVENIENT
LAST YEAR WHEN I HAD TO MOVE
HOME COMPLETELY.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.629
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.413
AND WE WERE ALL
SCARED AND SAD

09:48.413 --> 09:49.763
BECAUSE CHARLIE
WAS SO SICK.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.155
BUT YOU--
YOU WERE DIFFERENT.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.200
YOU WERE MISERABLE.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.375
OF COURSE I WAS.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.420
NOT JUST BECAUSE
CHARLIE WAS SICK.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.378
YOU WERE MISERABLE
BECAUSE YOU HAD
TO COME BACK

09:56.378 --> 09:58.423
AND TAKE CARE
OF THE KIDS AGAIN.

09:58.423 --> 10:01.775
WE ALL GOT STUCK, JULIA,
BUT YOU FELT STUCK.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.299
AND HERE'S ME AND CHARLIE
FIGHTING OVER OWEN

10:04.299 --> 10:07.432
BECAUSE WE BOTH
WANT THIS SO MUCH.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.174
AND YOU COME BACK HERE
TO GIVE US YOUR VOTE.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.436
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.005
I DON'T THINK YOU GET
A VOTE ANYMORE.

10:27.452 --> 10:30.194
I GUESS I'M JUST
A LITTLE NERVOUS,
THAT'S ALL.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.848
YOU'RE NERVOUS, WHY?

10:31.848 --> 10:35.199

A PART OF IT.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.036
NOT A PART OF IT?
SWEETHEART, YOU'RE
MY DAUGHTER.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.690
I KNOW THAT.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.692
I KNOW THAT,
IT'S JUST--

10:49.692 --> 10:52.390

ANDREW, LIKE, 5 TIMES,

10:52.390 --> 10:55.002
YOU KNOW, AND HE'S
ALREADY GOT 3 KIDS.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.569
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE I FIT IN...

10:57.569 --> 10:59.310
IF I FIT IN.

10:59.310 --> 11:03.793
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL PLACE
IN THIS FAMILY.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.448
I ALWAYS FELT LIKE
YOUR FATHER AND I
HAD FAILED YOU,

11:06.448 --> 11:09.581
THAT WE HADN'T GIVEN YOU
BROTHERS OR SISTERS
TO HELP YOU THROUGH

11:09.581 --> 11:12.019
IF, GOD FORBID,
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US,

11:12.019 --> 11:13.716
WHICH IT DID.

11:16.501 --> 11:20.114
YOU ALWAYS USED TO ASK
AT CHRISTMAS AND BIRTHDAYS,
DO YOU REMEMBER?

11:20.114 --> 11:22.290
NO.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.162
YOU ASKED FOR A SISTER
ALL WRAPPED UP IN A BOW.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
HA HA!

11:26.860 --> 11:30.646
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE
I CAN GIVE YOU THAT
KIND OF FAMILY,

11:30.646 --> 11:31.821
THE KIND YOU'VE
BEEN WANTING.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.708
SO I HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT THIS OWEN THING.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.927
WELL, DID CLAUDIA
TELL YOU ABOUT IT?

11:50.927 --> 11:53.060
I WAS JUST
AT THE RESTAURANT.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.976
WHAT, TO GET
BAILEY'S SIDE?

11:55.976 --> 11:57.978
NO, APPARENTLY
TO GET CHEWED OUT.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.331
BUT HE DID SAY
ONE THING.

12:03.331 --> 12:06.551
HE...HE REMINDED ME
ABOUT LAST YEAR

12:06.551 --> 12:09.163
AND HOW TOUGH IT WAS
ON ALL OF US.

12:09.163 --> 12:13.167
YOU HAD TWO KIDS
AND THERE WERE
3 OF US,

12:13.167 --> 12:16.170
AND NOW YOU HAVE
3 KIDS AND IT'S
JUST YOU.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.563
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

12:18.563 --> 12:22.567
WELL, JUST THAT,
UM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
THINK ABOUT IT,

12:22.567 --> 12:25.570

STAY AT BAILEY'S
FOR A MONTH OR SO.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.311

12:27.311 --> 12:29.836
HE'S SO CRAZY
ABOUT THIS,

12:29.836 --> 12:31.663
AND IT'S
UPSETTING YOU.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.143
AND IT'S
UPSETTING CLAUD.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.102
I AM NOT JUST GOING
TO GIVE UP LIKE THAT.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.191

5 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.529
OK? HE'S GETTING HELP.
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.704
I'M GOING TO WORK
THIS OUT, CHARLIE.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.141
I'M GOING TO MAKE IT WORK.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.839
SHOCKING BUT TRUE,
I'M NOT QUITTING ON HIM!

29:57.839 --> 29:59.798
THAT GUY BEATS WOMEN,
ALL RIGHT?

29:59.798 --> 30:02.148
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM
TO WORK IT OUT.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.759
NO, IT IS, BECAUSE
HE LOVES ME.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.674
IF HE LOVED YOU,
HE WOULDN'T BE
HITTING YOU.

30:06.674 --> 30:11.418
NO...NO, HE DOES
LOVE ME.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.680
JULIA--

30:12.680 --> 30:14.943
DON'T TOUCH ME!
DON'T...

30:17.946 --> 30:20.383
PLEASE, JUST GO!

30:24.126 --> 30:25.824
JUST GO!

30:52.415 --> 30:54.591
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
FIND ANYTHING.

30:54.591 --> 30:58.030
THAT'S OK,
BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO IF
YOU EVER HAVE THE TIME.

30:58.030 --> 31:01.163
YOU SUDDENLY
REALIZE YOU'RE A PART OF

31:01.163 --> 31:03.818
THIS LONG LINE OF PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW?

31:03.818 --> 31:05.776
GIVES YOU SUCH A FEELING
OF BELONGING.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.522
SO, MOM, I HAVE
TO TAKE OWEN HOME.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.829
I'M SORRY THAT I CAN'T
STAY FOR DESSERT.

31:14.829 --> 31:16.613
I'M SORRY, TOO.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.485
OK, WHY ARE
YOU MAD AT ME?

31:18.485 --> 31:21.967
I MEAN, YOU'VE
BEEN MAD AT ME SINCE
I GOT HERE TONIGHT.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.230
I WANTED TONIGHT
TO BE SPECIAL,

31:24.230 --> 31:26.972
AND I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY OR HOW

31:26.972 --> 31:28.582
THE SALINGERS ALWAYS
COME BEFORE FAMILY.

31:28.582 --> 31:31.585
BEFORE FAMILY?

31:31.585 --> 31:34.196
MOM, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE MARRYING ANDREW

31:34.196 --> 31:36.546
DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY
MAKE THEM MY FAMILY.

31:36.546 --> 31:39.245
ANDREW IS GOING TO BE
MY HUSBAND, SARAH.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.899
I KNOW THAT,

31:40.899 --> 31:43.902
AND I AM REALLY,
REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

31:43.902 --> 31:48.167
I AM, BUT MOM,
ANDREW'S YOUR CHOICE.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.473
YOU LOVE HIM,
AND HE'S GOING TO
BE FAMILY

31:50.473 --> 31:52.345
BECAUSE YOU CHOSE HIM.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.738
YOU KNOW,
KIND OF THE WAY
THAT YOU CHOSE ME

31:54.738 --> 31:56.653
WHEN YOU DECIDED
TO ADOPT ME.

31:56.653 --> 32:00.396
BUT IT'S NOT BLOOD
OR GENES OR DNA,

32:00.396 --> 32:03.008
AND IT'S
ALSO NOT A LICENSE
OR A CEREMONY, EITHER.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.270
IT'S A CHOICE.

32:07.229 --> 32:10.232
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS, YOU KNOW,

32:10.232 --> 32:12.626
MAYBE I'VE MADE
MY CHOICE, TOO,

32:12.626 --> 32:16.325
AND THE SALINGERS
HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE FOR
A VERY LONG TIME NOW.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.680
WELL, I GUESS I CAN'T ASK
YOU TO ACCEPT MY CHOICE

32:23.680 --> 32:25.508
IF I CAN'T ACCEPT YOURS.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.687
PLEASE ASK BAILEY
TO COME TO THE WEDDING.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.533
I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD
HAVE LEFT HER THERE.

32:50.533 --> 32:53.058
I DON'T KNOW,
EITHER.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.973
YOU SEE HIS FACE?

32:54.973 --> 32:58.498
SEE IT? I WANTED TO
SMASH IT IN.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.587
YOU SHOULD HAVE
LET ME.

33:00.587 --> 33:06.114
YEAH, WELL, I JUST
KEPT THINKING, YOU KNOW,
WE GOT TO DO THIS RIGHT.

33:06.114 --> 33:09.074
I KEPT THINKING HOW
WOULD'VE DAD DONE THIS?

33:09.074 --> 33:11.728
OF COURSE,
IF DAD WAS HERE,

33:11.728 --> 33:12.860
THIS PROBABLY WOULDN'T
BE HAPPENING.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.211
WHY?

33:16.211 --> 33:18.039
I MEAN,
WHAT THE HELL IS
SHE DOING WITH HIM?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.345
STAYING WITH HIM.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.868
I KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING,
CHARLIE.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.960
SHE THINKS THAT YOU THINK
SHE'S A FAILURE.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.006
WHAT?

33:28.006 --> 33:32.445
SHE THINKS YOU DON'T
ACCEPT HER THE WAY SHE IS,
AND YOU DON'T.

33:32.445 --> 33:35.317
OH, MAN...

33:35.317 --> 33:37.624
SO, SHE'S STAYING WITH
THIS GUY TO PROVE YOU WRONG.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.974
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE FINDING A WAY
TO BLAME ME FOR THIS.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.367
YOU ALWAYS FIND
SOMETHING, DON'T YOU?

33:41.367 --> 33:43.717
CHARLIE, YOU NEVER
ACCEPTED HER.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.981
HER AND GRIFFIN,
YOU NEVER ACCEPTED
HER AND GRIFFIN.

33:46.981 --> 33:50.332
LAST YEAR, ALL YEAR,
THEY WERE IN THE HOUSE

33:50.332 --> 33:52.334
BUSTING THEIR BUTTS
FOR YOU,

33:52.334 --> 33:53.727
AND YOU WERE
SO CRITICAL OF THEM.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.685
YEAH, AND I WAS RIGHT.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.687
IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

33:57.687 --> 34:03.389
AND GETTING DAPHNE
KNOCKED UP WAS SOME
GRAND ACHIEVEMENT.

34:06.696 --> 34:07.915
[TIRES SCREECHING]

34:13.703 --> 34:16.358
JULIA AND I ARE
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

34:16.358 --> 34:18.621
OK? YOU THINK...

34:18.621 --> 34:20.884
YOU THINK 5 YEARS AGO,

34:20.884 --> 34:23.713
IF MOM AND DAD
HAD PREDICTED WHERE
WE'D BE RIGHT NOW

34:23.713 --> 34:26.020
THAT ME GETTING SOME
GIRL PREGNANT WOULD
HAVE BEEN THAT FAR OFF?

34:26.020 --> 34:27.282
'CAUSE I DON'T
THINK SO.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.544
BUT JULIA?

34:28.544 --> 34:30.372
YOU THINK
THEY'D HAVE SAID

34:30.372 --> 34:31.982
THAT SHE WOULD BE
MARRIED AND DIVORCED TO
A MOTORCYCLE MECHANIC

34:31.982 --> 34:33.854
ALL BY THE RIPE OLD
AGE OF 20?

34:33.854 --> 34:36.509
AND NOW THIS?
I DON'T THINK SO,
BAILEY.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.337
SO, GO AHEAD
AND BLAME ME.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.382
BLAME ME BECAUSE
I WANT MY KID SISTER

34:40.382 --> 34:44.212
TO BE EVERYTHING
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

34:44.212 --> 34:46.780
JUST DON'T DO IT WHERE
I CAN HEAR YOU, OK?

35:13.241 --> 35:15.722
WELL, DID SHE
COME WITH YOU?
WHERE IS SHE?

35:15.722 --> 35:17.811
JULIA DIDN'T WANT TO COME
HOME WITH US, CLAUD.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.987
WHY NOT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:19.987 --> 35:23.077
SHE, UH...

35:23.077 --> 35:25.297
SHE DIDN'T WANT US
BUTTING INTO HER LIFE.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.212
SO, SHE ADMITTED IT.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.605
YEAH. SHE SAID THAT
IT WAS A PROBLEM,

35:29.605 --> 35:32.913
AND THAT THEY WERE GOING
TO WORK IT OUT ALONE.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.306
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.525
HOW CAN THEY WORK
IT OUT ALONE

35:36.525 --> 35:37.483
WHEN HE'S THE PROBLEM?

35:39.398 --> 35:41.313
I DON'T KNOW,

35:41.313 --> 35:45.578
BUT SHE'S GOING TO
HAVE TO FIGURE THAT
OUT FOR HERSELF.

35:45.578 --> 35:46.579
BUT SHE'S
ADMITTING IT.

35:46.579 --> 35:49.277
YEAH, SHE IS, CLAUD,

35:49.277 --> 35:51.366
BUT...IT'S KIND OF
LIKE THE SAME THING
WITH MY DRINKING.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.934
SHE KNOWS THAT
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.763
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS YET,

35:56.763 --> 35:59.157
OR HOW BAD IT IS.

35:59.157 --> 36:03.857
AND SHE THINKS
SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF
IT ALL BY HERSELF.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.076
YOU REMEMBER HOW MAD
I GOT WHEN YOU GUYS
TRIED TO HELP ME?

36:06.076 --> 36:08.035

INTO THE KITCHEN.
