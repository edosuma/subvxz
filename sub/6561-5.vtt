AND DON'T YOU HATE
EVERY LIVING THING?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.695
- YOU DON'T NEED LOVE
TO WRITE A LOVE SONG.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.396
YOU NEED PASSION.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.832
YOU REPLACE
WHAT YOUR PASSIONATE ABOUT

10:31.899 --> 10:33.934
FOR LOVE.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.969
- OKAY, SO THAT SONG
IS ABOUT A SANDWICH?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.138
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS SONG IS ABOUT!

10:38.205 --> 10:40.107
SONGS USUALLY COME TO ME!

10:40.173 --> 10:43.176
BUT THIS ONE IS NOT.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.646
- "GUSTAVO DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO WRITE A SONG

10:46.714 --> 10:48.615
AND HAS NEVER LOVED."

10:48.682 --> 10:50.117
FINISHED.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.552
- SIT DOWN!

10:52.619 --> 10:54.087
THIS SONG'S GONNA BE GREAT.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.088
I'LL SHOW YOU.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.524
FREIGHT TRAIN!

10:57.590 --> 10:59.159
DOGS. NOW.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.261
- YOU GOT IT.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.363
- CAN I BORROW HIM SOMETIME?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.265
- NO, YOU CANNOT.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.635
- LOOK, I'M NOT
SNEEZING ANYMORE,

11:08.736 --> 11:10.437
SO I--I GUESS I CAN GO BACK
TO THE PALMWOODS NOW,

11:10.503 --> 11:11.772
AND I DEFINITELY NEED
THAT SHOT.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.040
- [sneezes]

11:13.106 --> 11:14.641
- JAMES, IT'S NOT GONNA HURT
A BIT.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.009
IT'S GONNA HURT A LOT.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.211
- [shrieks]

11:18.278 --> 11:20.480
STAY BACK.
I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE THIS.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.515
- BARRACUDA MAN SPRAY.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.517
NOW IN NEW SPICE LIME.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.754
BETTER WEAR YOUR 'CUDA.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.122
- UNBELIEVABLE.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.858
IS THERE ANYTHING
BESIDES THAT SHOT

11:30.924 --> 11:32.826
THAT GET HIM
TO STOP SNEEZING TODAY?

11:32.893 --> 11:36.629
- HMM, THERE IS ONE THING
THAT MIGHT WORK.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.034
DO YOU THINK I NEED
A CHIN IMPLANT?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.407
- SO WE WERE THINKING,

11:47.474 --> 11:49.242
YOU DEFINITELY NEED
A GIRL STRATEGY.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.577
- SO TRY THIS.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.678
- [gulps]

11:54.314 --> 11:55.783
- YEAH.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.617
- THANKS, BUT I THINK
I'M GONNA STICK WITH

11:57.684 --> 11:59.787
THE "BE MYSELF" STRATEGY.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.294
- I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE
USED THE GLUE.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.200
- HI.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.534
- HI.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.704
- I JUST WANTED TO WELCOME YOU
TO THE PALMWOODS.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.806
I'M KENDALL, AND, UH...

12:20.941 --> 12:23.576
THIS LOOKS WEIRD, RIGHT?

12:23.643 --> 12:25.612
UH, WE CAN CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION

12:25.678 --> 12:28.381
WHEN MY FRIEND FREIGHT TRAIN
PUTS ME DOWN.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.485
- OH.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.686
- WE'LL DO THIS AGAIN SOMETIME.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.189
- YES!
- YES!

12:36.256 --> 12:38.291
WHOO!
- WHOO!

12:38.358 --> 12:39.359
- THAT IS NOT FAIR.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.393
I GET A DO-OVER.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.561
- NO, YOU DON'T.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.596
- THIS IS FUN.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.468
- * ANY KIND OF GUY YOU WANT *

12:48.535 --> 12:51.438
* THAT'S THE GUY I'LL BE *

12:51.504 --> 12:55.108
- * TURN MYSELF UPSIDE DOWN *

12:55.175 --> 12:57.444
- * YES, I WILL,
YES, I WILL *

12:57.510 --> 13:00.180
- [garbled singing]

13:00.247 --> 13:01.414
- WHAT WAS THAT?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.150
WHAT WAS THAT?

13:03.216 --> 13:05.152
- YOU TOLD ME TO GET HIM TO STOP
SNEEZING, AND I DID.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.320
- BUT HE CAN'T SING!

13:07.387 --> 13:10.290
AND WE HAVE TO SING
THIS LOVE SONG,

13:10.357 --> 13:12.425
BECAUSE THE RECORD COMPANY
WANTS A LOVE SONG,

13:12.492 --> 13:13.994
AND I STILL HATE THIS SONG!

13:14.061 --> 13:16.096
- WELL, HE REFUSES TO TAKE
AN ALLERGY SHOT,

13:16.163 --> 13:18.665
AND I'M NOT AN NURSE!

13:18.731 --> 13:20.100
- YOUR YELLING HAS IMPROVED.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.235
BUT MORE LIKE THIS:

13:22.302 --> 13:24.737
GET HIM AN ALLERGY SHOT!

13:24.872 --> 13:27.007
- IT'S MY FAULT, GUSTAVO.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.708
[sneezes]

13:28.775 --> 13:29.776
I NEED TO DO THIS.

13:29.877 --> 13:30.878
I'LL GO GET THE SHOT.

13:37.050 --> 13:37.985
[puma roars]

13:38.051 --> 13:40.320
- WHAT THE--

13:40.387 --> 13:43.123
- I'M NOT FEELING TOO WELL.
- I NEED A SHOT RIGHT NOW.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.724
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GONNA STAY HERE.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.393
- I'M GONNA STAY.
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.529
- IT'S NOT THAT BAD OF A SONG.

13:49.596 --> 13:53.300
IN FACT, IF I WAS A GIRL
AND SOMEONE SANG IT TO ME,

13:53.366 --> 13:54.567
I'D BE REALLY TOUCHED.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.904
- HOW TOUCHED?

13:56.937 --> 13:58.638
- LIKE GO OUT WITH YOU TOUCHED?

13:58.705 --> 14:00.573
- IF WE SANG THIS SONG TO YOU--
IF YOU WERE A GIRL?

14:00.640 --> 14:01.608
- YEAH.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.645
[all yelling]

14:07.915 --> 14:09.449
- "SO AFTER A DAY TRAPPED

14:09.516 --> 14:11.351
"WITHIN THE SOUNDPROOF WALLS
OF HIS STUDIO,

14:11.418 --> 14:14.587
GUSTAVO COULDN'T WRITE THE SONG
THAT HE WANTED AND FAILED."

14:14.654 --> 14:16.256
REPORT DONE.

14:16.323 --> 14:19.993
- YOUR REPORT AND MY SONG
ARE NOT DONE!

14:20.060 --> 14:22.262
RELEASE THE HOUNDS!

14:22.329 --> 14:23.530
I NEED MORE TIME.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.499
[all clamoring]

14:29.602 --> 14:31.371
- WHERE'S JAMES?

14:31.438 --> 14:34.774
- WELL, WE WERE IN MY CAR,
THEN HE JUMPED OUT,

14:34.841 --> 14:37.077
SPRAYED HIS ENTIRE BODY
WITH MAN SPRAY,

14:37.144 --> 14:40.513
JUMPED INTO A CAB AND SHOUTED,
"SHE WILL BE MINE!

14:40.580 --> 14:42.615
SHE WILL BE MINE!"

14:42.682 --> 14:45.485
- HE'S GOING TO THE PALMWOODS
TO STEAL OUR GIRL!

14:45.552 --> 14:46.486

- HELLO.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.871
[both shriek]

15:04.972 --> 15:07.340
- NOT THE REACTION
I USUALLY GET.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.341
BUT I'M JAMES.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.977
I'M IN A BAND.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.878
- HI, I'M JO.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.314
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.385
- HEY, I WAS THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD SEE A MOVIE LATER ON.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.719
[sneezes]

15:19.786 --> 15:21.521
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD SEE
A DOCTOR FIRST?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.490
- OH, BECAUSE OF MY SNEEZING,
RIGHT?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.858
AAH!

15:25.993 --> 15:27.727
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HANDS?

15:27.794 --> 15:29.096
- [sniffs]

15:29.162 --> 15:30.763
ARE YOU WEARING
BARRACUDA MAN SPRAY?

15:30.830 --> 15:32.632
- YEAH.

15:32.699 --> 15:36.069
BETTER WEAR YOUR 'CUDA.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.770
- YOU DO KNOW THAT STUFF
WAS RECALLED

15:37.837 --> 15:41.474
FOR CAUSING SEVERE
ALLERGIC REACTIONS, RIGHT?

15:41.541 --> 15:43.176
- AAH!

15:43.243 --> 15:44.811
[shrieking]

15:47.714 --> 15:48.848
KELLY, PICK ME UP.

I NEED THAT SHOT NOW.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.719
[all shrieking]

15:52.785 --> 15:54.254
- I'M ALLERGIC TO MAN SPRAY,

15:54.321 --> 15:55.588
AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK TO HER

15:55.655 --> 15:56.689
UNTIL I'M PRETTY AGAIN.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.325
- [together]
FORGET IT.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.426
- I'M GONNA SING HER A SONG.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.460
- NO, I AM.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.430
[all yelling]

16:03.496 --> 16:05.032

- NO.
- NO!

16:06.866 --> 16:08.501
ding! ding!

16:09.802 --> 16:11.371
- SHE LEFT THE POOL.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.040
all: SHE'S GONE?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.207
- YES, SHE WENT TO AN AUDITION.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.442
SHE USUALLY RETURNS AT 5:30.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.078

HOW YOU ENDED YOUR REPORT.

WHICH I CAN'T FIND!

16:42.969 --> 16:43.936
YOU CAN HELP ME.

HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMETHING

16:45.438 --> 16:47.607
SO MUCH THAT YOU COULDN'T LIVE
WITHOUT IT?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.809

GREAT SONG.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.002
BUT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW

18:56.068 --> 18:57.770

BACK HOME.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.339

I KNOW WHAT THIS SONG IS.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.853
IT'S NOT A SLOW LOVE SONG;

IT'S A FAST LOVE SONG.

KATIE.

UH, YOU TOLD ME
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
