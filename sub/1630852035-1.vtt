00:15.015 --> 00:19.518
[man] The day after the accident,
there was an autopsy done.

00:21.121 --> 00:25.157
The expectation was that the
crash was the cause of her death.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.260
[heart beating]

00:29.396 --> 00:31.196
That wasn't just
a traditional car crash.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.265
[phone rings]

00:34.968 --> 00:38.270
She didn't deserve that.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.668
<i>[narrator] 18 year old
Bianca Roberson</i>

01:09.670 --> 01:12.471
<i>is celebrating her
high school graduation.</i>

01:15.675 --> 01:19.578
Bianca was a social butterfly,
she loved to socialize.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.649
<i>[Josie] If you were
her friend...</i>

01:23.651 --> 01:28.020
you were a friend for life.
She was just so caring.

01:28.022 --> 01:32.524
I can't believe we're all gonna be in
different states! I'm gonna miss y'all so much.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.927
We had a nice graduation
party for her and all her friends

01:34.929 --> 01:40.766
and family showed up for her
and you know, she got a lot of gifts.

01:40.768 --> 01:45.270
Bianca was accepted to
Jacksonville University in Florida.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.807
<i>She was going for criminal
justice and psychology.</i>

01:48.809 --> 01:52.144
<i>She wanted to be an FBI agent.</i>

01:52.146 --> 01:59.785
She wanted to go out here and try
to save the world from bad people.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.155
She was extremely excited,
she couldn't wait, I mean

02:03.157 --> 02:06.558
this girl was walking on air.
[laughs]

02:06.560 --> 02:09.828
Watch out Florida,
here I come! [laughs]

02:09.830 --> 02:12.998
I think at the graduation
party I could just see

02:13.000 --> 02:16.502
<i>the difference in her,
that she's just growing up now</i>

02:16.504 --> 02:19.338
she's not
Mommy's little girl any more.

02:23.776 --> 02:28.247
<i>[Michelle] June 28, 2017, it
was just like any other day.</i>

02:31.251 --> 02:34.920
<i>We were going to the mall
to get school supplies</i>

02:34.922 --> 02:39.892
and we ended up in different cars
because I was at work, my mom was at work

02:39.894 --> 02:43.862
and Bianca went and
got her hair done earlier.

02:43.864 --> 02:48.867
We got outside and we put
all the bags in Bianca's car.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.004
I wanted her to go straight
home because I had ordered

02:52.006 --> 02:55.073
a college dorm box which
I was surprising her with.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.042
- What is it?
- [hums disapprovingly]

02:57.044 --> 03:00.712
- You have to wait until you get home.
- Okay.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.048
- Drive safe, sweetheart.
- You too.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.349
- [Michelle] I love you.
- Love you.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.953
I told her I loved her.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.355
And then she got in her car
and she left.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.526
[sighs deeply]

03:43.623 --> 03:46.358
[siren wails]

04:01.841 --> 04:05.944
<i>[Ben] When an accident
is reported serious...</i>

04:05.946 --> 04:09.848
<i>officers respond out, lights
and sirens as quickly as they can</i>

04:09.850 --> 04:12.084
<i>to run to anybody
in the vehicle.</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:18.023
The car had gone off of the
road lay down in an embankment

04:18.025 --> 04:23.262
and then up a hill and then struck
a number of trees in that area.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.302
<i>The responding officers
described a fairly substantial</i>

04:30.304 --> 04:32.871
<i>amount of blood in the
interior of the vehicle.</i>

04:32.873 --> 04:35.107
The crash victim appeared
to have a an injury to her head.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.442
[siren wails]

04:39.145 --> 04:42.180
[Jose] The thought
<i>was that the driv er's head</i>

04:42.182 --> 04:46.718
either struck the A-frame
of the vehicle

04:46.720 --> 04:53.225
<i>or as she was traveling through the brush,
a branch or tree came and struck her head.</i>

04:55.461 --> 05:01.967
<i>It was apparent that the driver
of the vehicle was deceased.</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:07.572
<i>There were personal belongings in
the vehicle, including her driver's license</i>

05:07.574 --> 05:10.976
<i>and she was identified
as Bianca Roberson.</i>

05:18.017 --> 05:21.787
<i>[Josie] I left the store
and going home...</i>

05:21.789 --> 05:26.892
they were detouring you off the
road, there was like this major accident

05:26.894 --> 05:31.430
and I remember saying to myself...
God, I hope that's not Bianca.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.134
<i>And then when
I get into the driveway...</i>

05:36.869 --> 05:38.437
<i>there's a cop.</i>

05:40.306 --> 05:42.407
<i>We don't have cops
in our neighborhood.</i>

05:44.043 --> 05:45.744
What in the world is going on?

05:45.746 --> 05:46.912
Can I help you?

05:46.914 --> 05:49.181
<i>[Josie] And he says to me...</i>

05:49.183 --> 05:53.352
"Are you Michelle Roberson?"
I said "No, I'm her mother".

05:53.354 --> 05:55.187
Then he says "We need
to speak to her".

05:55.189 --> 05:57.022
[phone rings]

06:00.426 --> 06:02.594
- Hello?
- My mom, she was crying.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.830
And I'm like "What's wrong?"
and she says

06:04.832 --> 06:07.432
"I don't know, the police are
here and are asking for you".

06:10.002 --> 06:12.571
<i>And then when
I got to the house...</i>

06:15.007 --> 06:19.578
The police officer comes to me and he
asks me "Did I own a green Chevy Malibu"?

06:22.281 --> 06:24.950
And he asked me
who would be driving it.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.686
<i>I said, "My daughter."</i>

06:27.688 --> 06:31.089
And he said "Would that be
Bianca Roberson?" and I said yes.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.425
And he said "I'm sorry
to inform you..."

06:35.661 --> 06:40.265
I couldn't even let him say
anything else after that.

06:42.702 --> 06:46.638
<i>[Josie] The whole thing was like a
haze, like it was somebody else's life.</i>

06:46.640 --> 06:50.308
I couldn't believe we were
going through this again.

06:52.612 --> 06:56.581
[narrator] <i>Just four years earlier,
Michelle lost her eldest son,</i>

06:56.583 --> 06:59.418
<i>22 year old Michael,
to heart disease.</i>

07:03.556 --> 07:04.990
How can this be happening again?

07:04.992 --> 07:08.427
How is my daughter dead?

07:08.429 --> 07:14.266
And I remember just sitting in
the house just crying, just crying.

07:21.207 --> 07:26.578
<i>[narrator] At the crash site,
investigators take witness statements.</i>

07:26.580 --> 07:30.449
One of the 911 callers saw
Bianca Roberson's

07:30.451 --> 07:32.751
vehicle traveling South
on the 100 Spur

07:32.753 --> 07:37.689
and a red pick-up truck
traveling next to her vehicle.

07:37.691 --> 07:43.795
<i>She believes she saw the red pick-up
truck impact Bianca Roberson's vehicle</i>

07:43.797 --> 07:46.998
<i>right before the merger caused
Bianca's vehicle to travel</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:49.334
<i>off the roadway into the brush.</i>

07:51.504 --> 07:54.906
<i>After she saw Bianca's vehicle
go off the roadway and crash,</i>

07:54.908 --> 07:58.343
this red pick-up truck just
took off at an accelerated speed.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.781
<i>It's clear to us that the
reason this vehicle took off</i>

08:02.783 --> 08:05.383
is because somehow or another
they were involved.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.558
<i>[narrator] Detective Torres
arrives on scene.</i>

08:13.560 --> 08:16.127
When you arrive
at a scene like this...

08:16.129 --> 08:20.832
<i>tensions are high
and people are distraught.</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:22.400
We have to conduct
an investigation...

08:23.803 --> 08:26.137
<i>and sometimes it's difficult.</i>

08:27.874 --> 08:30.775
PennDOT which is the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation

08:30.777 --> 08:36.281
<i>has cameras that show roadways throughout
the entire state of Pennsylvania.</i>

08:40.086 --> 08:43.355
<i>[narrator] Investigators request footage
from highway surveillance cameras.</i>

08:47.059 --> 08:50.762
We wanted to look at that
video to determine

08:50.764 --> 08:54.833
if we can see
Bianca Roberson's vehicle

08:54.835 --> 08:58.603
<i>and this red pick-up truck
that witnesses were describing</i>

08:58.605 --> 09:01.740
and what, if anything, that
video would capture

09:01.742 --> 09:04.209
with regard to their
interactions with each other.

09:08.848 --> 09:12.350
The day after the crash there was
an autopsy done on Bianca's body.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.388
<i>Everybody thought
it was a car crash.</i>

09:18.658 --> 09:21.126
Bianca's car had swerved
off the road and hit a tree

09:21.128 --> 09:24.462
and the expectation was that
was the cause of her death.

09:27.099 --> 09:30.835
- But during the course of the autopsy...
- [camera shutter clicks]

09:30.837 --> 09:37.075
<i>There was a bullet found
in Bianca's skull.</i>

09:37.077 --> 09:41.813
<i>- [narrator] The bullet is from a 40 caliber pistol.
- [phone rings]</i>

09:41.815 --> 09:45.183
[Chad] Wasn't just a car
crash, this is a homicide.

09:46.886 --> 09:47.886
She was shot?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.922
We were stunned.

09:50.924 --> 09:58.029
<i>[Chad] Somebody in our community shot
a gun, killed another driver on the road.</i>

09:58.031 --> 10:02.000
We didn't know if that was an individual
who was going to harm other people.

10:02.002 --> 10:02.801
Thanks for letting me know.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.204
We have to do
everything we can...

10:06.206 --> 10:08.373
to find the person who
committed this murder.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.110
[knocks on door]

10:12.612 --> 10:14.813
After the autopsy...

10:14.815 --> 10:20.218
Myself and Detective Ben Martin
went down to Bianca Roberson's home...

10:20.653 --> 10:23.989
Hi, may we come in?

10:23.991 --> 10:28.960
It was like, what else could be any
worse than what we're already dealing with?

10:30.763 --> 10:33.932
You might wanna sit down.

10:33.934 --> 10:38.970
<i>[Michelle] They told me that
Bianca wasn't in a car accident.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:41.072
She had been shot
in the back of the head.

10:43.075 --> 10:49.080
From being in a car accident
to being murdered...

10:49.082 --> 10:52.183
In less than a day and a half
was way too much for me.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.154
I lost it, I just started
screaming.

10:58.024 --> 11:01.726
[Jose]
<i>After we broke the news...</i>

11:01.728 --> 11:07.766
it was important to get information from
them to help us with our investigation.

11:07.768 --> 11:12.704
In many homicides the offender
is known to the victim.

11:12.706 --> 11:16.608
We need to find out if someone
had something against Bianca.

11:16.610 --> 11:19.177
Do you know anyone who would
have wanted to hurt her?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.781
<i>We didn't think Bianca knew
anybody who owned a gun,</i>

11:22.783 --> 11:25.650
you know and so we never thought

11:25.652 --> 11:31.222
that it was somebody that
knew us or even knew Bianca.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.693
<i>[Jose] So this becomes a
really difficult investigation.</i>

11:34.695 --> 11:37.128
<i>We have to look
into Bianca's life.</i>

11:37.130 --> 11:42.600
What she was doing
prior to the incident.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.937
Can you take us through
Bianca's movements yesterday?

11:49.075 --> 11:51.009
[Ben] <i>Once we learned
that Bianca had just</i>

11:51.011 --> 11:54.012
<i>come from shopping,
we went to the Walmart,</i>

11:54.014 --> 11:56.948
to look for video
from inside the store.

11:58.918 --> 12:05.023
We're trying to determine if
this all initiated at the Walmart,

12:05.025 --> 12:08.326
which was the last
place she was seen alive.

12:10.830 --> 12:16.901
Queue up the entrance camera
for June 28th, around 4.20 PM.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.838
<i>[Chad] Was there somebody
following her? Was there an altercation?</i>

12:19.840 --> 12:22.240
<i>Had something occurred during
that time that would give us</i>

12:22.242 --> 12:24.476
insight into why
she was murdered?

12:32.952 --> 12:34.485
Pause it right there.

12:41.794 --> 12:47.565
- That's Bianca.
<i>- [Jose] We're able to identify Bianca by her clothing.</i>

12:47.567 --> 12:52.170
She was wearing the clothing she
was wearing at the time of her murder.

12:52.172 --> 12:56.708
And I'm also able to identify
Michelle Roberson

12:56.710 --> 13:00.111
<i>and Bianca's grandmother
Josie, as I see them on the video.</i>

13:04.917 --> 13:09.220
Switch the interior camera around
5:20 PM, just before they left the store.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.463
Whoa, play that again.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.404
Are they being followed?

13:30.442 --> 13:34.045
We noticed that as Bianca and
her family were leaving the Walmart

13:34.047 --> 13:39.918
<i>there was a male with a red shirt
who was walking next to them...</i>

13:39.920 --> 13:42.921
This is something that
we look at to determine

13:42.923 --> 13:46.024
<i>if this individual
was somehow involved or</i>

13:46.026 --> 13:48.893
<i>had an issue with Bianca
and/or her family.</i>

13:48.895 --> 13:50.195
Let's see where he goes.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.069
Rewind.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.415
- False alarm.
- As Bianca and her family were leaving the Walmart

14:10.417 --> 14:14.452
the man with the red shirt actually
passed them and left ahead of them

14:14.454 --> 14:19.324
<i>which led us to believe that he was not
involved with what was about to occur.</i>

14:19.326 --> 14:24.896
Sometimes the most innocent encounters
we tend to put under the microscope.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.031
Pull up the exterior camera.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.912
<i>[Ben] There's no interactions
that are seen on video</i>

14:40.914 --> 14:45.183
that would lead us to believe that
the shooting had anything to do with

14:45.185 --> 14:48.353
anything that had occurred
inside of the Walmart.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.256
This looks like a normal day.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.590
<i>[Jose] When we're
watching the video...</i>

14:53.792 --> 14:57.996
it's sad, it's very sad.

14:57.998 --> 15:04.168
They had no idea that their world was
going to change so drastically as it did.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.010
<i>[narrator] Back at the police
department,</i>

15:12.012 --> 15:15.346
<i>ootage from the highway
surveillance cameras is in.</i>

15:17.182 --> 15:22.120
<i>[Jose] We start to look at the
Penn DOT live feeds to see if we can</i>

15:22.122 --> 15:25.256
locate any video with Bianca
Roberson's vehicle.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.859
What've we got?

15:27.861 --> 15:30.762
[Jose] <i>Unfortunately,
the location of the murder,</i>

15:30.764 --> 15:34.365
that part of the roadway
was not depicted on any video.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.336
Bring up the video of the camera just
North of the scenes, before the merge.

15:38.338 --> 15:44.442
<i>[Jose] So what we then had to do was
look at video from just prior to the scene.</i>

15:55.921 --> 15:57.322
Wait, pause it there.

15:58.891 --> 16:02.760
That's the red truck
and the green Chevy.

16:02.762 --> 16:07.332
We were able to isolate video of the red
pick-up truck and Bianca Roberson's vehicle.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.176
<i>[Ben] They were both in their
respective travel lanes,</i>

16:18.178 --> 16:21.479
<i>but they were both
approaching the merge</i>

16:21.481 --> 16:24.782
where it turns into one lane
pretty quickly.

16:24.784 --> 16:28.519
[Jose] <i>When we see those
vehicles driving side by side,</i>

16:28.521 --> 16:34.292
we have to wonder is there was some sort of
encounter between the operators of the vehicles.

16:34.294 --> 16:40.098
We're not able to get anything specific
about the vehicle to make it identifiable.

16:40.100 --> 16:44.569
<i>[narrator] Detectives check the next
available camera just after the crash site.</i>

16:57.082 --> 16:58.449
Rewind.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.025
Pause it there.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.764
We were able to isolate
a red pick-up truck

17:12.766 --> 17:16.534
<i>now traveling Southbound
on 202. The vehicles</i>

17:16.536 --> 17:20.104
<i>not even traveling
in the lane of travel.</i>

17:20.106 --> 17:26.577
<i>It's on the shoulder as it's passing
cars in the right lane of travel.</i>

17:26.579 --> 17:28.446
We believe the vehicle's
fleeing the scene.

17:31.116 --> 17:35.219
<i>There is no doubt in our minds
that this red pick-up truck</i>

17:35.221 --> 17:40.758
is being driven by the person
who murdered Bianca Roberson.

17:40.760 --> 17:46.030
<i>The fact of the matter is, there's
tons of red pick-up trucks in the region.</i>

17:46.032 --> 17:49.901
So unless we get more clear
video which helps us

17:49.903 --> 17:53.037
<i>to specifically identify
a particular truck,</i>

17:53.039 --> 17:55.573
we are looking for
a needle in a haystack.

17:57.843 --> 18:02.847
We then went to the next camera
which would have been Westchester Pike

18:02.849 --> 18:06.217
<i>and we started looking
at that surveillance video.</i>

18:08.554 --> 18:15.093
We were able to determine that the red pick-up
truck never made it to Westchester Pike.

18:15.095 --> 18:20.198
So it was apparent to us that the driver
of that vehicle got off of Route 202...

18:21.633 --> 18:23.167
<i>at Paoli Pike.</i>

18:27.806 --> 18:32.777
<i>We start knocking on every
door to every house</i>

18:32.779 --> 18:37.081
<i>and business along that exit.</i>

18:37.083 --> 18:41.886
In the hopes that we could find video that
would be more clear, which would allow us

18:41.888 --> 18:46.090
<i>to at least get a make or
model if not more information</i>

18:46.092 --> 18:49.427
relative to the
red pick-up truck.

18:49.429 --> 18:54.065
We also handed out fliers to
the public about this red truck...

18:56.301 --> 19:00.805
[Jose] <i>We were hoping that this
would generate some information from</i>

19:00.807 --> 19:02.473
<i>people who may know something</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:05.676
regarding the operator
of this vehicle.

19:05.678 --> 19:09.013
[narrator] <i>While officers
canvas for further leads...</i>

19:09.015 --> 19:12.383
<i>Detective Torres turns
back to the 911 calls.</i>

19:24.696 --> 19:30.635
<i>[Jose] One of the witnesses who called
911 said that there was an Aqua vehicle</i>

19:30.637 --> 19:34.438
between this pick-up truck
and Bianca Roberson's vehicle.

19:43.916 --> 19:49.353
It's not uncommon that people
who witness crashes just don't stop.

19:51.390 --> 19:55.426
Aqua's a public utility water
service company in this region.

19:55.428 --> 20:01.232
So it would have been an employee of the
company who would have witnessed the crash

20:01.234 --> 20:05.403
<i>so it was important for us to
identify the operator of the vehicle.</i>

20:06.772 --> 20:10.975
We made phone calls
to the Aqua corporation.

20:10.977 --> 20:16.180
They've determined what driver was
in the area and I reached out to him.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.486
<i>He was willing to come in
for a recorded interview.</i>

20:23.956 --> 20:27.124
We were hoping, best case
scenario, maybe he would

20:27.126 --> 20:30.328
be able to recall a
registration plate, a tag number.

20:31.663 --> 20:34.966
<i>We were excited
that we had the possibility</i>

20:34.968 --> 20:38.302
of getting information that
would help us solve this case.

20:45.077 --> 20:49.747
Bianca Roberson's vehicle passed
his vehicle on the right hand side

20:49.749 --> 20:53.050
and then made a lane change
to come back into the left

21:24.650 --> 21:28.052
<i>He did not realize it was
as serious as it was.</i>

21:28.054 --> 21:31.088
We were not further along in the
investigation after speaking with him.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.160
<i>It was very frustrating
because without finding out</i>

21:36.162 --> 21:39.397
<i>who owned this red pick-up
truck there's no way we were</i>

21:39.399 --> 21:41.999
gonna be able
to solve this case.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.102
[knocks on door]

21:48.907 --> 21:50.641
- [detective] Hi.
- Hi detectives, come on in.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.009
Thank you.

21:54.880 --> 22:00.051
Myself and Detective Martin
sat down with the Roberson family

22:03.922 --> 22:09.794
I remember them saying that they
had no license plate, no anything.

22:09.796 --> 22:13.731
And I just knew that this case
was just gonna be a cold case,

22:13.733 --> 22:17.134
that they were never
gonna find... the murderer.

22:18.770 --> 22:23.441
<i>[Jose] I said, I promise you
I will do everything I can</i>

22:23.443 --> 22:25.576
to find the person
who did this...

22:26.511 --> 22:28.078
To Bianca.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.851
<i>[narrator] Detectives try to pick
up the red truck on surveillance</i>

22:33.853 --> 22:36.821
<i>cameras East of Paoli Pike.</i>

22:36.823 --> 22:43.828
<i>The ultimate goal in trying to get as
much surveillance videos as possible is</i>

22:43.830 --> 22:47.031
hoping we get lucky. Hope that we
come across a surveillance system

22:47.033 --> 22:50.935
that is clear enough to where
you're able to get a registration.

22:50.937 --> 22:55.606
Or you're able to see the
operator of the vehicle.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.809
<i>We came across a business
called Jersey Mike's</i>

22:58.811 --> 23:04.181
<i>and when we found that
surveillance video, we were excited.</i>

23:19.030 --> 23:24.201
We actually see a red pick-up coming down
Paoli Pike towards Westchester borough.

23:27.205 --> 23:33.511
<i>[Jose] This red pick-up truck passes Jersey
Mike's about 5:31 PM, which is consistent</i>

23:33.513 --> 23:36.914
with everything else we know
because the distance between

23:36.916 --> 23:41.385
the scene of the murder and
Jersey Mike's is not that far.

23:43.121 --> 23:46.624
So we have what we think
is the suspect's truck

23:46.626 --> 23:51.495
at the right time heading West. We
feel like we're closing in on something.

23:53.665 --> 23:56.567
<i>Finding that video was
important because</i>

23:56.569 --> 24:00.671
that established a direction
of travel for the vehicle.

24:00.673 --> 24:04.508
We could now start tracking where
the vehicle ultimately ended up.

24:04.510 --> 24:08.579
Trying to get clear enough
shots to get a tag off of it.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.881
What's the next business along
this stretch we have surveillance for?

24:10.883 --> 24:13.584
Uh, Chestnutsquare Apartments.

24:34.272 --> 24:35.940
There it is.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.843
In reviewing the video we see

24:38.845 --> 24:44.582
<i>this red pick-up truck pass
Chestnutsquare Apartments.</i>

24:44.584 --> 24:49.487
We now know, okay, the red truck is
heading towards Westchester and so it helps

24:49.489 --> 24:53.958
limit the area that
we have to look into.

24:56.828 --> 25:00.030
<i>[narrator] Having narrowed down
the red truck's potential location,</i>

25:00.032 --> 25:03.601
<i>investigators study it
closely for identifying features.</i>

25:03.603 --> 25:05.002
Zoom in.

25:06.037 --> 25:09.240
Was there anything unique
about the trim package,

25:09.242 --> 25:12.543
the rims, the bumpers, the
windows... anything like that.

25:13.879 --> 25:17.815
<i>[Jose] We think we have
an older model, four door,</i>

25:17.817 --> 25:21.118
<i>or at least extended cab
pick-up truck.</i>

25:21.120 --> 25:26.824
<i>Potentially a GMC, Chevrolet
type of vehicle.</i>

25:26.826 --> 25:31.128
But beyond that, we couldn't
come up with anything specific.

25:31.930 --> 25:35.866
Let's get this video enhanced.
Might be something we're not seeing.

25:35.868 --> 25:42.473
We believe that if we take our efforts
and focus in the Westchester borough area

25:42.475 --> 25:45.409
<i>that we may have success
finding the operator of the vehicle.</i>

25:54.319 --> 25:59.023
<i>On June 30th, two days after
the murder of Bianca Roberson</i>

25:59.025 --> 26:02.860
- A witness comes forward.
- Thank you for coming in.

26:02.862 --> 26:07.097
And tells us that she was
traveling South on Route 202

26:07.099 --> 26:11.602
when this red pick-up truck
passed her on the shoulder

26:11.604 --> 26:15.139
and got off at Paoli Pike.

26:15.141 --> 26:20.210
<i>She then told us that the red
pick-up truck went Eastbound.</i>

26:21.546 --> 26:23.347
Not Westbound.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.815
Are you sure?

26:24.817 --> 26:29.553
[narrator] <i>Detectives have
been following the wrong truck.</i>

26:29.555 --> 26:35.793
Whenever you're following a lead and it
fizzles out it could be a bit frustrating

26:35.795 --> 26:38.796
<i>but that's put aside by the
excitement of having</i>

26:38.798 --> 26:42.232
more accurate, better
information to follow up on.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.803
- Did you happen to see license tag?
- No, I didn't.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.205
- I did see the driver.
- You did?

26:48.207 --> 26:49.540
Can you describe them?

26:51.142 --> 26:53.544
She described the driver
of the red pick-up truck

26:53.546 --> 26:58.549
as white male having
blondish, brownish hair,

26:58.551 --> 27:02.920
<i>some stubble, facial hair
and specifically described</i>

27:02.922 --> 27:07.091
his eyes as being bugged eyes.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.894
<i>We asked her if she'd be
willing to do a composite sketch.</i>

27:10.896 --> 27:12.429
Of course.

27:15.567 --> 27:20.904
<i>We release the images of the
composite sketch to the media</i>

27:20.906 --> 27:24.775
<i>in the hopes, that again, we
get someone to come forward</i>

27:24.777 --> 27:27.544
<i>to say they know who
this person may be.</i>

27:29.614 --> 27:33.951
<i>We know now that the operator
of the vehicle is a white male.</i>

27:33.953 --> 27:38.489
We know that Bianca Roberson
is an African-American female.

27:38.491 --> 27:42.526
<i>It's important for us to do
everything we can to determine</i>

27:42.528 --> 27:44.962
<i>if whether or not this was a
racially-motivated murder,</i>

27:46.598 --> 27:53.470
because it then leads you to believe
that this isn't an isolated incident.

27:53.472 --> 27:58.375
<i>This individual is capable of targeting
any person who may have a minority status</i>

27:58.377 --> 28:01.111
which makes him even
more dangerous.

28:04.883 --> 28:11.055
They showed us the sketch and knowing that
it was a white man that killed my daughter...

28:11.057 --> 28:17.194
The motive I believe was due to
the fact that my daughter was... black.

28:19.998 --> 28:24.368
<i>It's really painful because
Bianca had no hate in her heart.</i>

28:26.771 --> 28:28.305
Knowing that he was
still out there...

28:30.442 --> 28:33.077
<i>it was slowly killing me.</i>

28:37.148 --> 28:39.783

<i>[Jose] We start tasking investigators
with knocking on every single door.</i>

28:50.062 --> 28:53.063
- [knocks on door]
<i>- For every home</i>

28:53.065 --> 28:59.002
and every business along Paoli
Pike heading in an Eastbound direction.

28:59.004 --> 29:03.073
Hi there, West Goshen PD.
We're investigating a homicide.

29:03.075 --> 29:07.911
We found a resident that was several hundred
yards from the exit that had video footage.

29:07.913 --> 29:14.017
Can you queue it up
to June 28th, around 5:30 PM?

29:14.019 --> 29:20.524
That was exciting for us because we were
hoping to get better images of this truck...

29:22.427 --> 29:27.965
<i>and confirm that in fact,
it was traveling Eastbound.</i>

29:48.286 --> 29:49.486
There.

29:51.055 --> 29:52.455
That's our red truck.

29:55.960 --> 30:01.131
At 5:31 we see the red truck
passing the residence on Paoli Pike.

30:04.202 --> 30:08.572
This fit in with the timeline of the
truck traveling from the crime scene.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.474
Pause it there.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.310
Can you zoom in on the wheels?

30:15.780 --> 30:21.919
We were able to determine that the
red pick-up truck had after market rims.

30:21.921 --> 30:26.790
It was an extended cab.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.594
What we are unable to see in
the video is the driver of the vehicle.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.166
<i>We're not able to see
the registration plate.</i>

30:38.770 --> 30:44.942
<i>So we still need to continue our
search in hopes that each video...</i>

30:46.010 --> 30:48.312
reveals some additional
information.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.320
I think you need to
have a look at this.

30:58.656 --> 31:02.459
[Ben] <i>Footage from a
residential security system</i>

31:02.461 --> 31:08.098
down on Middletown road in Delaware
County that was in high definition.

31:16.207 --> 31:20.544
We're excited because the cameras
themselves are closer to the roadway.

31:27.819 --> 31:31.021
The pick-up truck
that we're looking for

31:31.023 --> 31:34.258
passes through the video.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.492
Zoom in on the window.

31:38.363 --> 31:42.900
There was a decal on the
window of the rear part

31:42.902 --> 31:45.569
of the passenger compartment
on the extended cab.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.841
<i>We see damage to the hood,
where the hood</i>

31:50.843 --> 31:56.580
<i>is slightly buckled, above
the front right fender...</i>

31:56.582 --> 32:02.920
and we see a vertical dent
on the passenger side door.

32:02.922 --> 32:08.926
Those characteristics make this a very
specific vehicle that we are looking for.

32:08.928 --> 32:12.129
We felt like okay, finally
we are getting a break.

32:12.131 --> 32:15.198
[narrator] <i>Detectives release
the new pictures to the media</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:18.402
<i>with a 5000 dollar reward
for information.</i>

32:19.938 --> 32:23.707
We were confident that when
people see these images

32:23.709 --> 32:27.144
from this video, someone's
going to know

32:27.146 --> 32:29.313
who that particular vehicle
belonged to.

32:37.622 --> 32:43.894
The community really rallied
around me and my family.

32:43.896 --> 32:50.534
<i>Someone threw a vigil in our backyard
and it was just filled with so many people.</i>

32:53.571 --> 32:57.140
Seeing all those
people were like...

32:58.776 --> 33:03.947
letting me know how much
people really did love Bianca.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.549
<i>How much her friends
really did love her.</i>

33:07.285 --> 33:10.087
It showed how important she was.

33:11.189 --> 33:14.091
Not only to me but
to the community.

33:17.462 --> 33:20.263
I think it touched
so many mothers

33:23.334 --> 33:28.505
because Bianca was so young it
could have been anybody's child.

33:34.946 --> 33:38.115
<i>[Jose] On July 1st...</i>

33:38.117 --> 33:41.885
<i>around 11 o'clock at night...</i>

33:41.887 --> 33:47.657
- I ended up leaving work and--
- [phone rings]

33:47.659 --> 33:50.794
<i>I get a phone call
from my lieutenant</i>

33:50.796 --> 33:54.197
who says you need
to get back to work.

33:57.335 --> 34:03.440
When I arrived at work I was told that
we received a phone call from an attorney

34:05.309 --> 34:08.845
<i>who said he had a client...</i>

34:08.847 --> 34:11.982
who wanted to turn himself in.

34:18.923 --> 34:24.961
There was a sense of relief to a
certain point, and a sense of curiosity.

34:27.832 --> 34:31.468
Who is this guy? What caused him
to do this? What is he gonna tell us?

34:31.470 --> 34:34.805
What is he gonna be like?

34:34.807 --> 34:39.009
<i>There was also a part of me
that's worried... is this going to be</i>

34:39.011 --> 34:43.246
<i>somebody who's making
something up or trying to get</i>

34:43.248 --> 34:46.383
attention because this was so
talked about in the community.

34:48.553 --> 34:51.088
His name was David Desper.

34:54.058 --> 34:58.061
<i>His attorney told us that his
client was going to invoke</i>

34:58.063 --> 35:00.197
<i>his right and not
provide a statement.</i>

35:00.199 --> 35:04.568
But told us that his client
owned a red pick-up truck,

35:04.570 --> 35:07.037
told us where
the pick-up truck was

35:07.039 --> 35:12.109
<i>and gave us consent to search
David Desper's bedroom.</i>

35:14.545 --> 35:16.746
<i>That information's great.</i>

35:16.748 --> 35:21.585
But we still have the burden of proving
that David Desper committed this murder.

35:24.822 --> 35:28.892
<i>We sent a team of
investigators to where</i>

35:28.894 --> 35:32.562
we were told we would find
the red pick-up truck.

35:35.032 --> 35:37.767
When we looked
at the red pick-up truck...

35:37.769 --> 35:41.004
<i>we could see the stickers
on the windows.</i>

35:43.141 --> 35:45.509
We were able to confirm
the after-market rims.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.582
We saw the damage
to the vehicle.

35:55.820 --> 35:59.823
<i>There was no doubt that
this was the vehicle</i>

35:59.825 --> 36:01.324
we were tracking.

36:04.028 --> 36:07.797
<i>When we look at the
registration plate on the vehicle,</i>

36:07.799 --> 36:10.700
<i>the vehicle's registered
to David Desper.</i>

36:10.702 --> 36:15.438
So there's no doubt the owner of the vehicle
is the person who is turning himself in.

36:17.742 --> 36:20.577
As our investigators searched
David Desper's room...

36:22.380 --> 36:28.285
<i>they found a Smith&Wesson
40 caliber pistol.</i>

36:28.287 --> 36:33.223
<i>That's important because the bullet
that was recovered during the autopsy</i>

36:33.225 --> 36:37.460
was a 40 caliber bullet fired
from a Smith&Wesson handgun.

36:41.566 --> 36:45.302
We found him.
We found him.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.405
We were gonna
get justice for Bianca.

36:50.641 --> 36:53.143
<i>On July 2nd, 2017,</i>

36:53.145 --> 36:57.614
<i>David Desper was charged
with first degree murder,</i>

36:57.616 --> 37:00.150
<i>third degree murder,
possessing an instrument</i>

37:00.152 --> 37:03.453
of crime and reckless
endangerment to another person.

37:09.227 --> 37:13.163
<i>We know who the murderer
of Bianca Roberson is, but</i>

37:13.165 --> 37:17.934
we still aren't clear about
what his motive was.

37:17.936 --> 37:21.738
<i>[Chad] One thing we had to explore
is that David Desper is a white male</i>

37:21.740 --> 37:24.975
and Bianca is an
African-American female

37:24.977 --> 37:27.911
and so we had to look into,
is this racially motivated?

37:27.913 --> 37:33.049
<i>Can that be a explanation
for why he did this?</i>

37:33.051 --> 37:37.887
We left no stone unturned when
it came to talking to people,

37:37.889 --> 37:42.792
<i>and digging through
social media platforms...</i>

37:42.794 --> 37:46.096
[Chad] <i>We weren't able to
find any social media activity</i>

37:46.098 --> 37:51.534
<i>or individual to testify that
David Desper was a racist.</i>

37:51.536 --> 37:55.939
It meant that we were not
allowed to present it in trial.

37:55.941 --> 38:01.544
- [line rings] - Hi, can we get a
search warrant on Desper's cellphone?

38:01.546 --> 38:06.449
One thing we were able to determine in the
analysis of David Desper's phone records

38:06.451 --> 38:09.919
<i>was that within minutes
of murdering someone</i>

38:09.921 --> 38:12.088
<i>he made a phone call
to his best friend.</i>

38:13.891 --> 38:16.159
We asked him if he'd
be willing to talk to us.

38:24.702 --> 38:30.440
It was a conversation about
car racing and vehicle parts.

38:45.923 --> 38:50.960
David Desper did nothing or said nothing
that would lead his best friend of many years

38:50.962 --> 38:53.897
<i>to believe that he just
committed a murder.</i>

38:53.899 --> 38:59.102
<i>It was amazing that he was
able to murder someone</i>

38:59.104 --> 39:05.742
and show no remorse,
no concern and ultimately

39:05.744 --> 39:09.479
<i>didn't surrender himself
until he knew</i>

39:09.481 --> 39:13.149
we were about to knock
on his door.

39:13.151 --> 39:17.821
<i>[narrator] With Desper refusing to
offer an explanation why he shot Bianca</i>

39:17.823 --> 39:20.223
<i>the prosecution can
only speculate.</i>

39:22.927 --> 39:28.498
<i>[Chad] On June 28th, 2017 David
Desper was driving on Route 100</i>

39:28.500 --> 39:30.033
in his red pick-up truck.

39:32.636 --> 39:34.971
Something happened
with Bianca's car.

39:38.542 --> 39:43.713
<i>She tried to merge...
and he got angry.</i>

39:43.715 --> 39:46.349
Instead of simply
letting her pass...

39:50.020 --> 39:54.557
<i>David Desper decided
to grab his handgun</i>

39:54.559 --> 39:59.295
pointed out his passenger window at
Bianca Roberson and pulled the trigger.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.530
[car breaks squeal]

40:02.967 --> 40:04.934
[loud crash]

40:09.373 --> 40:13.009
<i>He was mad about his place
and line in traffic</i>

40:13.011 --> 40:18.014
<i>and that's something that
I can't imagine accepting</i>

40:18.016 --> 40:21.985
as the explanation for why
your daughter's dead.

40:23.621 --> 40:26.689
[narrator] <i>David Desper pleads
guilty to third degree murder</i>

40:26.691 --> 40:31.027
<i>and is sentenced to a minimum
of 20 years behind bars.</i>

40:33.164 --> 40:39.269
It's a tragedy... and it is one of the saddest
cases I've ever had in my entire career.

40:42.239 --> 40:46.643
I never met Bianca but I got
to know her so well through

40:46.645 --> 40:49.546
all the people who cared
about her and loved her.

40:51.549 --> 40:56.252
<i>To hold Desper accountable,
it doesn't bring Bianca back.</i>

40:56.254 --> 40:58.455
But it feels like it was the
only thing we could do.

41:03.561 --> 41:08.064
This has truly destroyed me.

41:11.735 --> 41:16.406
<i>[sighs deeply] I was already
grieving the loss of my son...</i>

41:19.076 --> 41:22.545
[sighs] and she was
the last thing that I had...

41:25.549 --> 41:27.150
to keep me going.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.556
<i>[Josie] Michelle started
a foundation in Bianca's name.</i>

41:33.558 --> 41:35.758
<i>It's called Merge With Mercy.</i>

41:35.760 --> 41:39.696
And every year she
gives a scholarship to a child

41:39.698 --> 41:44.000
that is graduating from their
Boston high school.

41:46.704 --> 41:50.540
We also help families that have
been impacted by gun violence.

41:51.976 --> 41:56.179
<i>It was important that
I created this foundation...</i>

41:56.181 --> 42:01.551
<i>for me to have
a purpose in life and</i>

42:01.553 --> 42:05.054
a way to keep Bianca alive.

42:07.091 --> 42:10.960
<i>Sometimes I feel both her
and Michael's presence with me.</i>

42:12.830 --> 42:15.565
That's where
my strength comes from.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.937
I feel like they're my angels...

42:22.273 --> 42:25.375
that keep saying
"Go Mom, keep going Mom".
