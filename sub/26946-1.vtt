01:45.960 --> 01:47.710
- Why are there cameras everywhere?

01:54.260 --> 01:56.630
I don't know, mom, it's just weird.

01:56.630 --> 01:59.037
Is daddy gonna get rid of them?

02:04.330 --> 02:05.163
What?

02:05.163 --> 02:06.750
There are not raccoons in the attic.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.533
No, and I better not hear anything.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.880
I just got here about an hour ago.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.730
How about last night or this morning?

02:28.880 --> 02:31.920
Okay, you guys have a good time.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.180
I'll see you next week.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.013
I love you.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.593
That's some weird ass toys.

04:18.295 --> 04:19.815
I wonder what's in here.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.516
Oooh, what the hell is that smell?

05:32.380 --> 05:35.143
This better not be someone's ashes.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.039
What the hell?

05:44.810 --> 05:47.613
What is up with these
people and these toys.

05:49.712 --> 05:50.712
Nope, mm-mm.

05:55.214 --> 05:59.812
Go right back, take it
outside to your new home.

05:59.812 --> 06:01.145
Oooh, it stinks.

06:15.134 --> 06:16.967
You are going outside.

06:21.185 --> 06:22.018
It's cold.

07:10.128 --> 07:12.378
That's, that's from inside.

07:14.136 --> 07:15.053
What the...

07:17.723 --> 07:18.556
Hello?

07:30.105 --> 07:30.938
Hello?

07:38.434 --> 07:39.267
Hello?

08:27.899 --> 08:28.732
What?

11:00.249 --> 11:01.082
Hello?

11:08.577 --> 11:10.113
Who did this?

11:13.300 --> 11:14.713
Who did this?

11:16.580 --> 11:18.593
Reggie, if you're here, stop playing.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.860
You know damn well my
dad will whoop your ass

11:22.860 --> 11:25.060
if he knew you were in
here while he wasn't.

11:25.940 --> 11:26.773
Hello?

11:29.800 --> 11:32.121
Well, whoever it is wanna
come and clean this up

11:32.121 --> 11:34.871
because I'm not cleaning this up.

11:47.723 --> 11:49.140
Who's doing this?

11:55.033 --> 11:55.866
Hello?

12:15.150 --> 12:19.320
Whoever made this mess, I swear,

12:19.320 --> 12:21.760
got me cleaning this damn mess.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.943
All this damn fake blood.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.793
This is freaking annoying.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.693
This is disgusting.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.566
Look at this.

12:45.566 --> 12:47.600
If this stains my,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.140
if this stains my mom's floor...

12:59.647 --> 13:00.480
Hello?

13:04.360 --> 13:05.443
Look at this.

15:21.201 --> 15:22.534
Are you serious?

17:07.601 --> 17:08.434
Fuck.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.823
This shit ain't funny.

17:15.612 --> 17:16.779
What the hell?

17:19.619 --> 17:21.037
Who's doing this?

17:40.781 --> 17:41.698
Fuck, fuck.

17:42.935 --> 17:44.352
Who's doing this?

17:50.336 --> 17:52.836
I'm tired of fucking cleaning.

17:56.167 --> 17:57.667
Look at this shit.

18:00.105 --> 18:01.188
What is this?

18:05.687 --> 18:08.104
Oh, this better not be blood.

18:12.964 --> 18:15.464
Look at it all on the counter.

18:39.717 --> 18:40.550
Hello?

18:43.295 --> 18:46.212
All right, stop playing around now.

19:49.864 --> 19:50.697
Hello?

20:26.661 --> 20:27.494
Hello?

20:42.808 --> 20:43.641
Hello?

20:46.485 --> 20:47.318
Hello?

21:35.190 --> 21:38.913
Oh shit, I got my own
washer and dryer up here.

21:40.995 --> 21:41.828
That's dope.

21:41.828 --> 21:43.690
I don't have to go all the way downstairs.

21:43.690 --> 21:44.890
Just come right up here.

22:32.591 --> 22:34.008
Who's down there?

22:36.130 --> 22:37.930
You better get the hell out of here.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.343
How do I know someone's not watching me?

24:03.685 --> 24:05.185
Where's the light?

25:34.373 --> 25:35.206
I know it's not Reggie.

25:35.206 --> 25:37.873
I checked his Instagram
and he's in North Carolina.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.300
I know it's not raccoons.

25:48.300 --> 25:51.930
I sent you the video of hello
written all over the floor

25:51.930 --> 25:54.390
and raccoons wouldn't--

25:54.390 --> 25:55.973
Mom, why is daddy yelling?

26:05.820 --> 26:08.090
Please tell daddy it's
not one of my friends.

26:08.090 --> 26:10.587
I don't know who it is, but I'm scared

26:10.587 --> 26:12.793
and I'm not imagining things.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.053
What do you mean I might be doing it?

26:24.590 --> 26:25.510
Sleepwalking?

26:25.510 --> 26:28.010
I haven't done that since
I was 10 years old, mom.

26:34.730 --> 26:37.083
I guess it's possible,
but how would I know?

26:41.130 --> 26:42.510
Okay, momma, I will.

26:46.176 --> 26:47.009
Love you too.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.066
Hello?

31:45.244 --> 31:46.077
Hello?

31:59.213 --> 32:01.463
What is this doing in the dryer?

32:05.408 --> 32:09.480
Raccoons, it's no damn raccoons.

33:26.627 --> 33:28.294
These goddamn dolls.

33:41.382 --> 33:42.215
Shit.

36:38.775 --> 36:40.275
It's cold in here.

36:42.554 --> 36:44.471
And what is that smell?

37:08.998 --> 37:11.498
What are you still doing here?

37:14.097 --> 37:14.930
Uh-uh.

37:14.930 --> 37:16.290
You gotta go.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.123
Nope.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.757
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

37:35.313 --> 37:36.146
Mm-mm.

37:40.588 --> 37:41.421
Stupid.

38:46.197 --> 38:47.614
Who's doing this?

38:48.750 --> 38:50.040
It's not funny anymore.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.353
Please stop.

39:09.590 --> 39:10.457
Come on now.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.673
Hello?

40:33.220 --> 40:34.960
Please stop doing this.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.624
You're upsetting me.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.303
I should call the police.

40:46.860 --> 40:47.933
What the hell?

43:16.570 --> 43:17.737
What the heck?

44:50.315 --> 44:51.280
Hey, it's me, guys.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.110
And I am back.

44:53.110 --> 44:56.330
Um, I'm in our new house
on Steelmanville Road

44:56.330 --> 44:59.010
and one of your fools think it's funny

44:59.010 --> 45:02.463
to sneak in here and scare
me on my first night.

45:03.580 --> 45:04.890
If my dad finds out you're in here,

45:04.890 --> 45:05.936
he's gonna kill you.

45:22.710 --> 45:24.040
Momma, you need to get some of this shit

45:24.040 --> 45:25.093
cleaned out of here.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.670
All right, this my aunt Bebe's room.

45:43.670 --> 45:45.940
I just put a tape on it, so I can tell

45:45.940 --> 45:47.551
if someone's going in or out,

45:47.551 --> 45:50.043
but it's locked, so, yeah.

46:13.840 --> 46:16.090
If you're hiding in
here, I'm gonna find you.

46:24.987 --> 46:25.820
Hello?

46:37.907 --> 46:40.824
You better not be hiding back here.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.990
I'm gonna find you if you're in here.

47:34.363 --> 47:35.196
Hello?

48:12.657 --> 48:17.657
And my parents' bedroom is locked.

48:29.969 --> 48:32.802
I don't think my parents trust me.

48:45.013 --> 48:45.846
Hello?

49:09.140 --> 49:14.140
This door was opened and now it's locked.

49:14.720 --> 49:17.510
I think it's so creepy that
someone might be in here

49:17.510 --> 49:19.660
because what if it's
somebody I don't know?

49:21.270 --> 49:22.410
Who's in there?

49:22.410 --> 49:23.573
Hello?

49:29.190 --> 49:30.183
Hello?

49:34.010 --> 49:35.087
I need a weapon.

51:32.287 --> 51:33.253
Who are you?

51:36.605 --> 51:37.438
Who are you?

51:46.050 --> 51:49.443
If you don't leave, I'm
gonna call the police.

53:00.621 --> 53:02.696
You better get the fuck out of here.

53:40.118 --> 53:40.951
Hello?

53:43.420 --> 53:44.360
Dee, come pick me up.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.593
I just texted you my new address.

53:49.370 --> 53:52.070
Listen, I'll just explain
it to you when you get here.

53:55.270 --> 53:56.103
Why not?

53:59.980 --> 54:01.780
Well, can you borrow your mom's car?

54:10.980 --> 54:12.690
Let me call you back.

55:12.206 --> 55:14.978
Are you coming to get me?

55:14.978 --> 55:16.647
You don't get off till six?

55:16.647 --> 55:17.480
What?

55:23.730 --> 55:26.153
Girl, there's some crazy
shit happening here.

55:29.970 --> 55:31.687
You Googled the address?

55:31.687 --> 55:32.520
Here?

55:35.226 --> 55:36.809
And what popped up?

55:40.811 --> 55:45.144
Girl, there ain't no such
thing as no haunted house.

55:46.983 --> 55:47.816
Oh shit.

55:51.888 --> 55:52.721
Hello?

56:49.030 --> 56:50.083
Shit.

56:50.083 --> 56:53.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

56:56.707 --> 56:58.243
Nobody better not come in here.

56:58.243 --> 56:59.076

57:00.898 --> 57:01.731
Oh fuck.

57:06.309 --> 57:07.142
Oh fuck.

57:08.033 --> 57:10.950

If anyone's watching
this, please come save me.

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:47.220

01:19:22.394 --> 01:19:24.222
- Who the fuck are you?

01:19:24.222 --> 01:19:25.282
- I'm Tom Riley.

01:19:25.282 --> 01:19:27.345
Who the fuck are you?

01:19:27.345 --> 01:19:28.647
- This is my house.

01:19:28.647 --> 01:19:30.130
- Ow, shit.

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:32.120
Well, it used to be my house.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.930
- So, are you the old man watching me

01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:36.090
on these damn cameras everywhere?

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:38.103
- Look, get over yourself.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.670
I'm binge-watching 13
Reasons Why on the iPad

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.330
I took from this house

01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:46.890
and in the middle of it, I keep getting

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:49.660
these push notifications,
'cause the cameras

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.010
are still on the iPad connected here.

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:54.296
So, I don't give a shit what
you're doing in this house.

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:02.300
And here I see you running around--

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.950
- All right, well did
you see the damn clown?

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:06.020
- Clown?

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.040
- Yes, the clown
that chained me up down here.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.353
I bet you didn't see him.

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:11.890
- I hate clowns.

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:12.723
Let...

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.820
Can we get you out of that?

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:15.870
- Yes.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.513
- Can I have this here, Wonder Woman?

01:20:26.569 --> 01:20:27.402
- This hurts.

01:20:27.402 --> 01:20:28.235
Can you...

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.717
- I think these should do it.

01:20:42.934 --> 01:20:43.767
Goddammit.

01:20:43.767 --> 01:20:44.716
- Here, let me do it.

01:20:44.716 --> 01:20:46.699
- If I can't do it, you can't.

01:20:46.699 --> 01:20:47.532
Here.

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.222
Slow down, girl.

01:21:02.222 --> 01:21:03.490
Damn.

01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:06.778
I came in here, these lights were off.

01:21:06.778 --> 01:21:08.042
The front door was open.

01:21:08.042 --> 01:21:09.625
This door was open.

01:21:10.927 --> 01:21:12.480
- The door was unlocked?

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:13.730
- Yeah, it was wide open.

01:21:15.766 --> 01:21:16.724
- I locked it.

01:21:16.724 --> 01:21:18.141
- Here, let's go.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.390
Well, where you going?

01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.270
- I'm getting out of here.

01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:25.620
- We don't know where he's at, so come,

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.420
let's just figure this out, come on.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.960
Figure it out.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.823
There was a book here, used to be here.

01:21:40.169 --> 01:21:41.810
Where the hell is it?

01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:44.303
Oh wait, here it is, come on.

01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:48.443
Yeah, this is it.

01:21:48.443 --> 01:21:50.280
This is the book I was talking about.

01:21:51.496 --> 01:21:52.660
- I was checking that out earlier.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.853
- Does clown begin with a K or a C?

01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:58.430
- Are you for real?

01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:59.500
- Come on.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:00.333
- A C.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.560
- All right, here it is.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.933
Is that him?

01:22:04.933 --> 01:22:05.766
- Yep, that's him.

01:22:05.766 --> 01:22:09.300
- All right, that is
the Crescent Moon Clown,

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.660
which can only rise
during a crescent moon.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.434
However, according to
this, the previous owner

01:22:16.434 --> 01:22:19.890
had put it into a box,
covered it with ashes,

01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:21.770
and sat a cross on top,

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.520
and then locked the box and put it away.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.430
Did you find a box like this?

01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:29.110
- Yeah, I found it downstairs

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.500
and it had this ugly doll in it

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.170
and it was stinkin',
so I threw it outside.

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:35.710
- So you opened it.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:36.543
- Yep.

01:22:36.543 --> 01:22:37.390
- And you took the cross out.

01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:38.223
- Yep.

01:22:38.223 --> 01:22:39.950
- Well, that's how he got free.

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:42.370
But, even though it's a crescent moon,

01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:44.855
and he's out of the box, he needs a witch

01:22:44.855 --> 01:22:48.300
to be able to convert
him into a large form,

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.430
like you say he is now.

01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:51.750
Have you seen anything that
looks like a witch around?

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:54.215
- That nasty lookin'
thing with the robe on?

01:22:54.215 --> 01:22:56.370
- Yeah, that sounds like,

01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:57.250
that sounds like it.

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:59.570
Well, we'll deal with her later.

01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:02.090
We gotta deal with him first.

01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:05.544
But you want the good
news or the bad news?

01:23:05.544 --> 01:23:06.640
- I don't know.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.940
- There is no good news.

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.340
Here's the bad news.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.480
According to this, the way
the Crescent Moon Clown

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.560
pays back his person that freed him

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.680
is by digging a grave, killing them,

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.810
throwing them in it, and burying them.

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:26.027
So, right now, this clown
is somewhere out back there,

01:23:26.027 --> 01:23:28.050
digging a hole for you.

01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:28.883
- Nope.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.063
- But I have an idea.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.920
I have an idea how we're
gonna deal with this.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.343
Come on, follow me.

01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:39.880
All right, so here's what we're gonna do.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.720
He still thinks you're chained
and locked in the basement.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.110
So, that means he's
coming back to get you.

01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:48.950
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hide

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:50.840
in this room right here

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.690
and when he comes in that door,

01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:55.380
he's gonna come here to turn
and go down the basement

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.680
and I'm gonna run forward

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.150
and just shove him down the steps,

01:23:58.150 --> 01:23:59.850
shove him as hard as I can.

01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:01.550
Hopefully he snaps his neck.

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:03.420
But I'll slam the door shut.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:04.730
I'll push that chair over

01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:05.900
and you and I will get out of here

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.010
and get as far away from
this place as possible.

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.340
- For real?

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.490
- This is what we're gonna do.

01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:13.770
So, while you go hide
out there, keep an eye.

01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:14.830
- All right.

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:16.440
- I'm gonna hide here

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.838
and we'll wait for him to come back.

01:24:18.838 --> 01:24:19.671
All right?

01:24:19.671 --> 01:24:21.338
- All right.

01:24:43.052 --> 01:24:44.135
- Fuck.

01:25:01.466 --> 01:25:02.638
- What the fuck?

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:05.529
Give me my damn wig.

01:25:05.529 --> 01:25:08.950
You don't fuck with a black girl's hair.

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:10.100
- Did we get him?

01:25:13.396 --> 01:25:14.229
Oh fuck, oh shit.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.050
- You want some
of this too, bitch?

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:21.883
Come on.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.224
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:30.891
- Stop it.

01:25:32.113 --> 01:25:33.000
- Ow.

01:25:56.823 --> 01:25:58.906
- Renee, our plan worked.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:02.993
Wait, where are you going?

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:04.733
Hang on.

01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:09.123
Wait up.

01:26:11.651 --> 01:26:13.485
- Can you give me a ride to my friend's?

01:26:13.485 --> 01:26:16.083
- I would love to, but I don't own a car.

01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:18.470
- Of course you don't.

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:20.813
- Hang on.

01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:26.940
So, you gonna stay here?

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:27.951
- No, I'm getting out of here.

01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:29.503
I'm moving out of the south, fool.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.410
What the hell was that?

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:39.973
- Ah, it's a long story.
