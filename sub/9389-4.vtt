00:01.502 --> 00:04.671
(SINGING) It seems today that all you see

00:04.755 --> 00:08.008
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.091 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.681
On which we used to rely?

00:14.765 --> 00:18.101
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.185 --> 00:21.396
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.480 --> 00:22.981
All the things that make us

00:23.065 --> 00:24.274
Laugh and cry!

00:24.733 --> 00:30.030
He's a family guy!

00:35.827 --> 00:39.081
You guys are gonna love this spa.
They give the best massages.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.999
Your whole bodies
will feel like Joe's legs.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.961
-Wow.
-That would be nice, for a short period.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.337
I tell you, I need this.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.339
I've had a really stressful morning.

00:47.422 --> 00:51.677
Wait a minute, Doc.
Are you telling me that it's 8:25?

00:51.760 --> 00:52.845
MAN: Precisely!

00:52.928 --> 00:55.138
Damn. I'm late for school.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.768
Don't need money
Don't take fame

00:59.852 --> 01:03.313
Don't need no credit card
to ride this train

01:03.397 --> 01:07.359
It's strong and it's sudden
And it's cruel sometimes

01:07.442 --> 01:11.488
But it might just save your life...

01:12.030 --> 01:14.032
(SINGING) That's the power of love

01:15.367 --> 01:18.287
Okay, why don't you just get yourself
settled up on the table?

01:18.370 --> 01:21.456
-I'll give you a minute.
-What am I supposed...

01:28.547 --> 01:30.591
-You ready in there?
-Yeah.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.634
(MAN LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

01:32.718 --> 01:35.846
You put some fake poo on the floor...
Oh, no!

01:36.430 --> 01:38.390
Get out! Get out! Scat!

01:39.474 --> 01:41.268
This is more like it.

01:41.602 --> 01:48.192
(MAN SINGING) Oh, my love...

(NEW AGE MUSIC PLAYING)

01:49.359 --> 01:50.360
Is the music okay?

01:50.444 --> 01:53.822
Actually, would you mind
tuning it to 97.1?

01:53.906 --> 01:56.491
ANNOUNCER:
You're listening to "The Quiet Storm."

01:56.575 --> 02:00.454
Up next, the music of the Isleys,
Teddy Pendergrass,

02:00.537 --> 02:05.584
-and right now, here's some Marvin Gaye.
-That's what I'm talking about.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.546
Oh, this is long overdue.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.799
There's nothing like a good suit massage.

02:12.925 --> 02:16.637
Focus on the lapels,
that's where I carry most of my stress.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.891
Okay, here's one.
If you were gay and you had to have sex

02:20.974 --> 02:24.603
with either John Forsythe
or Sean Connery, who would it be?

02:24.686 --> 02:27.606
-That's easy. John Forsythe.
-Yeah, John Forsythe.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.815
John Forsythe, absolutely.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.692
That's so funny.
I would also say John Forsythe.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.571
-I was just curious.
-Yeah, I mean Sean Connery is just so...

02:34.905 --> 02:36.073
Uh-oh.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.702
-Oh, God, I am so sorry.
-It's too late, the damage is done.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.542
Hey, Chris, you know what I just got?

02:46.625 --> 02:49.419
The box set of Lord of the Rings.
It's awesome.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.840
Yeah, but you remember the giant eagle
they rode in the first one

02:52.923 --> 02:54.967
that then rescues them
at the end of the third one?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.093
Yeah, yeah.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.428
Yeah, why didn't they just
fly the eagle to Mordor

02:58.512 --> 03:01.557
instead of spending three movies
walking there?

03:01.640 --> 03:04.351
That's not what it's about, Chris.
It's about the quest.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.312
Well, I'm not arguing that with you, I'm
just saying there's a hole in the story.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.692
-Have you ever seen Krull?
-No.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.610
Yeah, you don't need to see Krull.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.655
All right, guys, the best thing you can do
for your body after a massage

03:16.738 --> 03:21.076
-is hot coffee, alcohol and Slim Jims.
-Oh, Dad, I'm glad you're here.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.203
There's something I need to ask you.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.915
-What is it, Chris?
-Well, today, in gym class,

03:26.999 --> 03:30.002
I noticed one of my testicles
went up inside my body

03:30.085 --> 03:34.006
and it hasn't come back out yet,
and I'm a little scared.

03:34.089 --> 03:37.050
Sir, this employee just made
a sexual remark to me.

03:37.134 --> 03:41.305
No, Dad, I'm really worried.
See? Look. Is that normal?

03:41.388 --> 03:45.058
Sir, sir!
Your employee is exposing himself to me!

03:45.142 --> 03:47.603
-But, Dad...
-You got a lawsuit on your hands, mister.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.271
Whoa, whoa! Okay, look, look.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.356
If you'd be willing to forget
this whole thing happened,

03:51.440 --> 03:55.986
-I'll give you this gas card.
-Unlimited free gas for a year?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.696
Just 'cause I threatened to sue you?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.199
Well, that,
and you're not the worst-looking guy

04:00.282 --> 04:03.869
-who's ever come in here.
-That's what I wanted to hear.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.002
Wow, Peter, a free gas card.
This could save us a lot of money.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.505
Yeah, everyone except Brian,
'cause he bought a Prius.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.089
What a dumbass!

04:16.215 --> 04:17.591
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:17.674 --> 04:19.426
What? What? What'd I miss?
Are we laughing at Brian?

04:19.510 --> 04:21.678
(LAUGHS) Brian, you suck.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.766
-What the devil is in here?
-I threw out all your apple juice, Stewie.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.603
-We're a gas family now.
-You put gasoline in Stewie's bottle?

04:29.686 --> 04:32.689
You damn fool!
You're more useless than Aquaman.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.857

nobody can hear you out here.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.449
-I can!
-Aquaman, help!

04:42.533 --> 04:46.161
-Hey, hey, hey, let her go!
-Or what?

04:46.245 --> 04:48.622
Or... I don't know, man,

04:48.705 --> 04:52.626
but you're lucky you're not doing that
over here in the ocean.

04:52.835 --> 04:58.257
-Or else... Or I would stop you.
-For God sakes, help! Do something!

04:59.508 --> 05:01.093
If you don't like starfish,

05:01.176 --> 05:02.970
you're gonna be mad
about what I just did!

05:03.053 --> 05:05.013
Oh! God, help!

05:05.097 --> 05:09.184
You're in for it now, buddy!
I got, like, five fish coming to help.

05:09.268 --> 05:12.813
-Here they are!
-Help! He's hurting me!

05:12.896 --> 05:14.565
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have led him on.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.823
-Peter, what the hell is that?
-It's a space shuttle, Lois.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.535
I figured, with unlimited free gas,
I can finally afford to go into space.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.328
Why is it every time I open this door,

05:28.412 --> 05:32.165
you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle
you've inexplicably acquired?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.418
I got this at a NASA auction
for next to nothing.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.502
They were gonna scrap it

05:35.586 --> 05:37.129
'cause of some minor
mechanical problems or something.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.464
Instead, they sold it to me.
Very simple explanation.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.675
I do not want you
trying to fly that thing.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.343
You're not even a trained astronaut.

05:43.427 --> 05:47.806
Relax, Lois. Nothing bad ever happens
to space shuttles. Now stand back.

-You got lucky, Peter.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.658
-How was it, Dad?
-Mind-boggling, Chris.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.119
Barreling around the Earth
at 5 miles per second,

06:09.203 --> 06:11.455
watching the sun rise
over the Sea of Japan.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.123
It's indescribable.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.210
Plus, I had lots of time to rub one out,
which, in space, is great,

06:16.293 --> 06:18.670
except after a while
it's like living in a snow globe.

06:18.754 --> 06:22.299
Peter, instead of wasting your free gas
on a series of comedic stunts,

06:22.382 --> 06:26.678
why don't you use it more constructively?
I mean, we could take a family vacation.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.347
Yeah, that's a great idea, Mom.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.349
Hey, maybe we can go
to the island from Lost.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.184

to Matthew Fox's heavy breathing.

It's got a hint of coconut in it.
And something else...

11:51.461 --> 11:53.797
They're gone. I'm all alone.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.091
I can do whatever I want!

11:56.300 --> 11:58.343
(CHUCKLES) I'm going to take Brian's novel

11:58.427 --> 12:02.306
and replace every use of the word "and"
with the word "fart."

12:03.182 --> 12:07.269
"The young soldier fart his brother
looked at each other, fart both knew that,

12:07.352 --> 12:09.813
"with love fart truth fart courage,

12:09.897 --> 12:12.941
"they would both emerge
st-fart-ing on their feet."

12:13.025 --> 12:14.985
(GROANS) That one didn't work.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.739
Well, let's see
what fascinating pubescent treasures

12:18.822 --> 12:20.115
Chris has got hidden away.

12:20.199 --> 12:21.241
Ooh!

12:21.325 --> 12:24.828
Hustler magazine. I finally get to see
what a vagina looks...

12:24.912 --> 12:27.623
God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

12:32.085 --> 12:36.298
You can't hurt anyone anymore.

12:42.513 --> 12:43.764
Why are we in New York?

12:43.847 --> 12:45.724
I thought we were going
to the Grand Canyon.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.977
Well, I just thought we should stop
and pay our respects.

12:50.771 --> 12:55.108
Ground Zero.
So this is where the first guy got AIDS.

12:55.192 --> 12:58.237
Peter, this is the site
of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.322
-So Saddam Hussein did this?
-No.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.698
-The Iraqi army?
-No.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.116
-Some guys from Iraq?
-No.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.077
That one lady
who visited Iraq that one time?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.954
No. Peter,
Iraq had nothing to do with this.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.498
It was a bunch of Saudi Arabians,
Lebanese and Egyptians

13:09.581 --> 13:12.084
financed by a Saudi Arabian guy
living in Afghanistan

13:12.167 --> 13:14.169
and sheltered by Pakistanis.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.713
So you're saying we need to invade Iran?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.093
Wake up, Stewie.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.929
Let's get you out of that seat
and into a fresh diaper.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.766
(GASPS) Oh, my God!
Peter, Stewie's not in the car!

13:27.850 --> 13:29.852
Oh, my God!
We must have left him at home!

13:29.935 --> 13:35.858
Oh, my God. That is hilarious.
He is probably freaking out.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.735
God! I would give anything
to see his face right now.

13:38.819 --> 13:42.114
He's probably all, like,
"Where the deuce is everyone?"

13:42.197 --> 13:44.157
Well, I can't really do a good Stewie.

13:44.241 --> 13:48.412
Oh, my God! What kind of a mother am I?
Peter, we gotta go home right now!

13:48.495 --> 13:51.039
Great, Lois.
Now we gotta bail on the whole vacation!

13:51.123 --> 13:54.293
This sucks!
Now, every time I come back to this place,

13:54.376 --> 13:57.296
it's going to be associated
with one particular bad memory.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.381
Actually, we could call
Quagmire and Cleveland.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.841
They can go over and check on Stewie.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.302
They'd probably even be willing
to look after him till we got home.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.013
Well, okay. I guess so.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.307
Yeah. Quagmire and Cleveland
are great with kids.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.559
Like Robin Williams in Patch Adams.

14:10.642 --> 14:14.021
Oh! Everybody's lying around in here.
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

14:14.104 --> 14:17.399
What am I, in Congress?
See? Laughter is the best medicine.

14:17.482 --> 14:21.945
-Please, sir, I'm in so much pain.
-Shut up and listen to my material!

14:22.070 --> 14:25.282
What's this? Bedpan? Peter Pan.
Next stop is Neverland.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.409
Come, Wendy, fly with me.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.286
(BEEPING)

14:31.914 --> 14:32.956
Hmm.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.209
I've never executed
a diaper change before.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.668
Of course, how hard can it be?

14:36.752 --> 14:39.838
You just unfasten these things,
then lay back with your legs in the air,

14:39.922 --> 14:42.049
and let nature do the rest.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.260
It's still there.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.888
Usually, the doody's disappeared by now,
but it hasn't.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.184
-(GASPS) Intruders!
-Stewie, you in there?

14:56.271 --> 14:58.023
You think he's here?

15:00.651 --> 15:04.196
God! It's Cleveland and Bob Hope.
Oh, well. The damage is done.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.115
Better get them out of here.
Perhaps I'll shackle them in the basement

15:07.199 --> 15:10.619
with a 24-hour broadcast
of the DirecTV help channel.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.331
What the hell? Where are we?

15:14.414 --> 15:17.042
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Getting to know your
remote is easier than you might think.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.003
These buttons at the top
control volume, channel

15:20.087 --> 15:21.797
and the power on your receiver.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.091
To see what else is playing,
just press "guide,"

15:24.174 --> 15:25.717
and then scroll through
the onscreen menu

15:25.801 --> 15:27.177
by pushing the arrow button.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.471
-Now that we've learned the basics...
-This may be kind of messed up,

15:29.555 --> 15:32.474
but am I the only one
getting a boner right now?

15:32.558 --> 15:35.561
Is there anything
that doesn't give you a boner, Glenn?

15:35.644 --> 15:38.105
People who use the word "rubbish"
when they mean "garbage."

15:38.188 --> 15:39.940
-Really?
-Yeah. Not even a wiggle down there.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.108
ANNOUNCER ON TV: ...your shows
will appear on "My Playlist."

15:43.277 --> 15:44.444
Peter, it's been eight hours,

15:44.528 --> 15:47.281
and I haven't heard back
from Cleveland or Quagmire.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.949
I even tried Joe.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.409
This is my wheelchair!

15:50.492 --> 15:52.661
There are many like it,
but this one is mine!

15:52.744 --> 15:56.748
Without me, my wheelchair is useless!
Without my wheelchair, I am useless!

15:56.832 --> 15:57.916
(PHONE RINGS)

15:58.000 --> 15:59.585
-Shut up!
-Okay.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.465
This sucks!
I want to see the Grand Canyon!

16:05.549 --> 16:08.260
I'm sorry, but we are not
leaving Stewie by himself.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.012
We're going home.

16:12.556 --> 16:15.434
No way!
Those guys have a TV in their car!

16:15.767 --> 16:19.396
(LAUGHS) They're watching
Operation Dumbo Sex with Don Knotts.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.815
Professor,
you've got to impregnate this elephant

16:21.899 --> 16:24.151
or the entire species will become extinct.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.404
You mean I gotta put this thing
in that thing?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.407
Well, this is a job
that's not worth the money!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.034
Peter, watch the road!

16:32.117 --> 16:34.620
Lois, get off my back, will you?
I'm trying to watch TV.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.748
I swear to God, sometimes I think
your head's screwed on backwards.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.166
I mean, do you have any idea...

16:39.249 --> 16:40.250
(GASPS)

16:40.375 --> 16:41.752
(LAUGHING)

16:42.920 --> 16:44.129
(SCREAMING)

16:47.299 --> 16:49.218
(GROANING)

16:49.301 --> 16:52.137
Hey, crashy,
what are you doing down there?

16:57.601 --> 16:59.520
Well, Rupert, we're out of food, diapers,

16:59.603 --> 17:03.148
and just about everything else.
Which means I've got to get a job.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.192
Otherwise, we'll be in worse shape
than Morbidly Obese Albert.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.738
Hey, Morbidly Obese Albert,
we brought you some chocolates.

17:09.821 --> 17:13.575
I can't eat those chocolates
on account of my diabetes.

17:13.951 --> 17:17.579
-Remember, they had to take my foot?
-Look on the bright side.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.456
Now you get your shoes half price.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.041
(LAUGHS)

17:21.208 --> 17:23.502
All right. Maybe I'll have one.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.467
Welcome to McBurgertown.
Can I take your order?

17:30.551 --> 17:34.054
-Stewie, you've got to clean the bathroom.
-No! No! I'm not going back in there!

17:34.137 --> 17:37.057
Stewie, I'm not giving you a choice.
You've gotta go clean that up.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.102
No! No! It was literally
only on the floor, all right?

17:40.185 --> 17:42.187
There was no attempt
to get near the toilet.

17:42.271 --> 17:45.649
It's like they just pressed their buttocks
against the wall.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.693
The only part of the floor
that didn't have poo on it

17:47.776 --> 17:50.195
-was the part that had a baby on it.
-Go!

17:53.574 --> 17:56.535
-Peter, did you get the train tickets?
-Actually, no, Lois.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.787
There was a guy inside
selling shower curtain rings,

17:58.871 --> 18:02.207
-so I bought a bunch of those.
-Peter, that was the last of our cash!

18:02.291 --> 18:04.585
These ones have helium in them,
so they're very light.

18:04.668 --> 18:08.297
You are unbelievable! The last four days
have been a living hell!

18:08.380 --> 18:11.466
Our baby is at home all by himself,
yet, instead of getting us home,

18:11.550 --> 18:14.344
you've managed to make things worse
at every turn!

18:14.428 --> 18:16.972
A monkey would be
a refreshing step up from you.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.807
A monkey would talk less.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.517
Here's a little tip.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.437
If your instinct tells you
to do something, don't do it!

18:23.520 --> 18:25.522
If your instinct tells you
not to do something,

18:25.606 --> 18:27.858
it's probably the right thing to do!

18:29.234 --> 18:31.028
You wanna hurt me?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.197
Go right ahead,
if it makes you feel any better.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.284
I'm an easy target.
Yeah, you're right. I talk too much.

18:38.452 --> 18:43.081
I also listen too much.
I could be a coldhearted cynic like you,

18:43.957 --> 18:46.502
but I don't like
to hurt peoples' feelings.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.588
Well, you think what you want about me.
I'm not changing.

18:49.671 --> 18:55.093
I like... I like me. My kids like me.
My friends like me.

18:56.053 --> 18:59.681
'Cause I'm the real article.
What you see is what you get.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.395
(LAUGHS)

19:05.479 --> 19:07.105
Movie references.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.234
Guys, I found us a ride to Quahog
in the back of a truck! Hurry!

19:10.317 --> 19:11.527
Oh! Thank God!

19:11.610 --> 19:13.320
Come on.
Let's head home before Stewie gets hurt,

19:13.403 --> 19:15.864
like Fozzie Bear
when he went to Saudi Arabia.

19:15.948 --> 19:17.741
It's good to worship Allah,

19:17.824 --> 19:20.994
'cause I used to worship summer!
Wocka, wocka.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.746
(MEN CHATTERING)

19:22.829 --> 19:25.332
I once knew a guy who was so Arab...

19:25.624 --> 19:27.209
How Arab was he?

19:27.793 --> 19:30.379
He was so Arab that everybody liked him,

19:30.462 --> 19:32.589
and there was nothing funny
about him at all.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.680
Stewie, can I see you in my office
for a second?

19:39.763 --> 19:44.184
-Yeah. What's up, Eric? Everything okay?
-Yeah. Just come into my office.

19:45.269 --> 19:48.063
Stewie, Shawanda said
she saw you sneaking food.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.606
What?

19:49.690 --> 19:51.316
She said she saw you
in the back of the kitchen

19:51.400 --> 19:54.611
-sneaking a fish sandwich.
-Come on, dude!

19:55.612 --> 19:59.199
Yes. Okay. But the thing was
five minutes past the throw-out time.

19:59.283 --> 20:00.492
Well, be that as it may,

20:00.576 --> 20:03.287
Shawanda took these pictures
on her cell phone.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.626
You're fired.

20:13.005 --> 20:16.592
We're broke, Rupert.
I'm jobless, there's no food left,

20:16.675 --> 20:19.928
I'm out of diapers,
and I'm down to Meg's last hat.

20:20.012 --> 20:23.265
We're doomed, you know.
Let it be written on my tombstone

20:23.348 --> 20:26.852
that my life was considerably better
with my family around,

20:26.935 --> 20:29.980
and I didn't realize it
until it was too late.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.273
(HORN HONKS)

20:38.989 --> 20:43.869
Mommy! Daddy! Chris! Dog! Brian!
They're home!

20:47.789 --> 20:52.419
-Mommy! Thank God you're home!
-Stewie, my baby!

20:52.503 --> 20:53.921
I promise with all my heart

20:54.004 --> 20:56.423
that I'll never say or do
anything bad to you

20:56.507 --> 20:58.425
for the rest of the evening.

20:58.509 --> 21:02.930
By the way, I disabled the V-chip,
and I watched so much porn.

21:03.013 --> 21:05.807
Sweetie, I'm so glad you're all right.

21:05.891 --> 21:08.018
Yeah. No thanks
to Cleveland and Quagmire.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.686
Wonder what the hell happened to them.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.730
BOTH: And now you're ready to enjoy
the full range

21:11.813 --> 21:14.274

Thanks for joining us.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.710
Welcome to the DirecTV Help Channel,

your destination for getting started
with your new DirecTV system.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.050
Did I tell you I'm getting a spin-off?
