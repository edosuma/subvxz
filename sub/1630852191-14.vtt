WEBVTT

01:07.734 --> 01:09.861
I won't let you run off this time.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.864
I'm going to get back everything

01:14.324 --> 01:15.533
that I lost.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.717
Woo-jae.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.262
Woo-jae?

01:40.558 --> 01:41.601
You're right.

01:42.727 --> 01:46.606
I did love you with all my heart.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.402
I gave it my all.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.657
I even chose to ignore
and deceive my family

01:56.991 --> 02:00.245
to the point where
I was horrified at myself.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.842
But it's over now.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.426
We were sick of each other.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.390
We saw each other at our worst.

02:22.892 --> 02:26.729
It's over. Don't try to salvage it.
Don't long for it.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.858
When will you stop clinging to the past?

02:32.402 --> 02:37.240
Give it your all to the person
beside you now, okay? I beg you.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.332
You're the one
who cut our relationship short.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.129
I haven't even started yet.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.979
You're up early.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.191
I stayed up all night painting.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.069
I want to finish this project
as soon as I can.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.278
Hopefully.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.949
You must be exhausted.
You know the orientation's today, right?

04:01.032 --> 04:03.368
I know. I'll be there on time.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.079
I'll wake the kids up. Have a seat.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.596
The shoulder pain worsened
after I started working longer hours.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.433
It's quite stiff.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.854
Blood clots are sensitive
to temperature, humidity, and weather.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.690
And it gets more painful at night.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.776
I should've gotten it treated properly
right after I hurt it.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.570
The shots only help so much.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.031
You need to strengthen your muscles here.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.367
But for now, you need rest.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.870
And be sparing with the shots.

04:47.954 --> 04:52.250
They temporarily numb the pain,
but at times, pain is needed.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.337
It's your body's way of warning you
to be more careful from now on.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.090
A warning?

05:01.718 --> 05:04.637
I guess this pain's giving me
a timely warning.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.223
Sorry?

05:09.726 --> 05:10.560
<i>Seo Woo-jae!</i>

05:12.103 --> 05:13.479
<i>Ho-su's my son! I raised him!</i>

05:13.563 --> 05:16.190
<i>I won't let you turn him
into a twisted person</i>

05:16.274 --> 05:18.651
with an inferiority complex like you!

05:44.302 --> 05:47.930
Mr. Seo! Hold on.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.977
I think I need to tell you this.

05:53.853 --> 05:54.937
What is it?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.272
Ms. Gu…

05:57.940 --> 06:00.234
Take good care of her.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.279
She seems to be struggling lately.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.615
I know I'm being nosy.

06:06.657 --> 06:07.950
I'm sorry.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.454
But since you're her husband…

06:11.537 --> 06:12.872
I'm not her husband anymore.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.584
It was only on paper,

06:17.251 --> 06:18.836
but soon not even that.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.174
If you have feelings for her,

06:24.133 --> 06:25.468
don't worry about me.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.804
Because she's not the one

06:28.930 --> 06:30.306
I'm in love with right now.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.474
What?

06:32.558 --> 06:34.519
I… I don't understand.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.437
I actually envy you.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.691
The woman I love has a family of her own,

06:42.819 --> 06:44.987
so I have no choice
but to hide my feelings.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.829
Does that woman

06:54.122 --> 06:57.875
also have feelings for you?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.088
Yes.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.631
Don't do it.

07:05.883 --> 07:09.011
She won't abandon her family.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.680
That doesn't matter.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.520
Because Hui-ju's worth loving
despite all that.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.326
Most high schools nowadays

07:32.869 --> 07:36.622
focus on subjects that'll help prepare
their students for college.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.042
Arts high schools are no exception
and simply a stepping stone

07:40.126 --> 07:42.336
to art universities for students.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.630
"A Taerim graduate."

07:44.714 --> 07:47.550
We, the faculty, promise to do our best

07:47.633 --> 07:51.012
to make sure those words
will mean something to others.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.936
Please say something too, Ms. Jeong.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.146
I'm a fan of yours!

08:00.229 --> 08:02.607
I decided to send my kid here
because of you.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.859
-It's nice to see you.
-Please.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.277
It seems you are

08:06.944 --> 08:09.238
more interested in her than my briefing.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.284
Ms. Jeong, please say a few words.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.498
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS
PARENTS' INVITATIONAL ORIENTATION

08:27.256 --> 08:30.051
You all know
that I never went to college, right?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.598
You won't have to worry

08:35.681 --> 08:39.310
about your family's status
or which college you graduated from.

08:39.810 --> 08:43.564
You'll be acknowledged
for being a Taerim graduate.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.236
Our students will be able
to enjoy the present.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.112
I'll strive to make that happen

08:50.196 --> 08:52.031
by guiding…

08:54.367 --> 08:56.911
our chairman down the right path.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.204
Thank you.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.005
-Can I have your autograph?
-Sure. Thank you.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.423
You actually bought this?

09:09.507 --> 09:11.175
It's such an honor.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.970
You take such great care of your body.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.888
-I agree.
-You're flattering me.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.723
Let's take a photo.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.268
-Sure.
<i>-Does Hui-ju know</i>

09:20.351 --> 09:21.936
<i>about what you did to me?</i>

09:22.687 --> 09:24.188
<i>Probably not.</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:28.442
<i>Had she known,
she would've left you long ago.</i>

09:39.912 --> 09:41.497
I loved your book.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.111
Did you come here with Woo-jae?

10:19.577 --> 10:21.203
Are you okay with Hui-ju…

10:23.247 --> 10:24.874
seeing you like this?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.506
She'll try to be good to you
for some time out of guilt.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.593
But she'll soon get tired of it.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.805
"I think I've done more than enough,

10:39.889 --> 10:42.016
so why is he still like that?"

10:45.603 --> 10:48.022
Her guilt will turn into frustration.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.361
She'll never be able to really know
what it's like to be betrayed.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.363
Only you and I

10:56.656 --> 10:58.908
know what that's like.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.459
Gosh. Is that so?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.394
What brings you here?

11:39.782 --> 11:43.411
Those two must click so well.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.043
How dare you come here?

11:52.628 --> 11:53.879
Why are you even here?

11:53.963 --> 11:57.091
To see you. You looked great up on stage.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.177
You looked like a great trophy wife.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.183
Stop being so reckless.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.603
I really want to see this project through.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.166
Did you visit the school today?

12:31.000 --> 12:31.834
Yes.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.005
Why?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.799
I missed her.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.304
Go home first. I have work left to do.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.187
They say you need courage
to divorce someone,

12:52.855 --> 12:54.482
but I can't say I completely agree.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.905
Staying married putting up with everything

13:01.447 --> 13:03.407
also requires courage.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.785
Because it's much shittier.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.583
We're a married couple no matter what.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.420
We vowed to be by each other's side

13:17.296 --> 13:19.590
no matter how torturous it may be

13:19.673 --> 13:21.884
until death do us part.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.556
Do you still want to break up?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.603
Then just die.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.814
Or kill me instead.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.503
You need to come here.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.219
All right.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.097
I'll talk about it with your mom.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.808
Was that Jeong-hwan?

14:11.892 --> 14:13.352
I wanted to talk to him too.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.110
Did you tell him to come to Korea
during the summer break?

14:22.486 --> 14:23.612
I forgot.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.615
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.372
Okay.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.463
Close the door on your way out.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.476
Goodness. I can't believe
you'll be going to school.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.269
My puppy.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.108
This is the school he'll attend.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.820
It'll start in September,
so you have time. Get ready.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.241
I'm not giving you a choice.
I'm informing you.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.161
It's time to take my meds.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.299
I guess Min-seo isn't going.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.301
I heard this was important.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.389
She slipped in the bathroom
and hurt her face.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.100
What terrible timing.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.019
She does surgery after surgery.
It's not surprising.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.106
She should let someone take her place,

16:23.315 --> 16:26.151
so she can begin overseeing the hospital.

16:26.694 --> 16:30.406
I mean, it's time
for our mother-in-law to take it easy.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.229
Min-seo. It's me.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.692
I'll call your brother
if you don't open the door.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.652
Do you hear me?

17:32.301 --> 17:34.845
Why are you quiet
when you were just brazenly knocking?

17:35.679 --> 17:36.889
Leave then.

17:37.473 --> 17:41.685
I thought someone as smart as you
would handle things differently.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.401
I was beaten by my father growing up.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.283
He beat me whether I was obedient
or when I ran away.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.913
Thinking he would beat me more if I cried,
I even tried holding back my tears.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.873
But he beat me for being headstrong.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.046
I did nothing wrong,
but he'd beat me all the time.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.549
Just thinking that I deserved it

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
made everything simpler.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.221
Why are you telling me this?

18:19.681 --> 18:21.308
Do you think we're the same?

18:21.975 --> 18:23.769
Not at all.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.314
Unlike me, you don't need to wait.

18:28.982 --> 18:29.942
What?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.403
All that I could do was wait.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.617
But fortunately,
my father passed away early.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.419
But such fortunate situations

18:50.712 --> 18:53.132
don't come so easily.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.803
You need to make the decision.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.598
And I know you're capable of doing that.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.742
Does Jeong-hwan know

19:20.826 --> 19:23.078
what kind of person his father is?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.124
I'm sure

19:28.208 --> 19:29.918
he's homesick.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.136
But he doesn't come home
during his breaks. Why do you think?

20:05.829 --> 20:07.497
Did you notice on your way here?

20:07.581 --> 20:10.250
The GTX will be going through there.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.629
And this area has been chosen
to be the next development area.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.673
Did you see how all the roads were paved?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.634
And look around.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.678
There are no unpleasant facilities,
are there?

20:22.221 --> 20:26.892
Fifty-five townhouses will be built here.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.813
Read the brochures I gave you
and take a look around.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.315
NEW CONSTRUCTION SITE

20:33.899 --> 20:36.443
<i>Honey, when will you get here?</i>

20:36.526 --> 20:37.611
<i>Are you almost here?</i>

20:37.694 --> 20:38.904
HONEY

20:52.793 --> 20:54.294
-Hey.
-You bitch.

20:54.378 --> 20:58.423
Was scamming me not enough?
How dare you seduce my husband?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.217
-You crazy bitch. How dare you?
-Hey!

21:00.300 --> 21:01.510
Hey, wait!

21:01.593 --> 21:04.596
-You're mistaken! We can talk it out!
-How dare you seduce him!

21:04.680 --> 21:07.933
GIRLS' RESTING ROOM

21:13.605 --> 21:15.357
You spread this rumor, didn't you?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.775
FIRST-YEAR AT SEOAN HIGH
WITH HER SUGAR DADDY CAFE OWNER

21:17.818 --> 21:19.778
I quit working there ages ago.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.154
A sugar daddy?

21:21.238 --> 21:23.282
Did you see us? Did you?

21:24.491 --> 21:27.411
I did. I just wrote what I saw.

21:28.870 --> 21:29.746
What did you see?

21:30.706 --> 21:34.126
I saw you two walking
into an alley full of motels.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.756
There's a shopping mall there.
He bought me a present since--

21:39.840 --> 21:43.510
Exactly. Why would he
get you something for no reason?

21:43.593 --> 21:46.221
Why don't you blabber
about my dad and quit making up lies?

21:46.888 --> 21:49.182
Then I'll talk about what I saw as well.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.769
-What?
-About your mom and Ms. Gu's husband.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.899
You know Ms. Gu and I are close.
Did you think I didn't know?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.359
How dare you?

21:59.443 --> 22:02.863
I only kept it a secret
since we were still friends.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.157
Do you think I won't do it?

22:07.701 --> 22:10.495
Hey! Lee Ju-yeong! Hey!

22:36.646 --> 22:38.398
Did you see Mom?

22:41.526 --> 22:42.778
She's sorry.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.907
She must've wanted to brag
since it was the opening event.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.785
Why bother bragging
when it's going to be another flop?

22:54.081 --> 22:55.123
Give it to her.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.503
I can't do this to my husband anymore.
This is the last time.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.797
So tell her never to call me again.

23:02.672 --> 23:06.051
I won't give her any money
through you ever again.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.720
Hui-ju.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.597
That's enough. Let's go.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.766
Wait. I'm not done praying.

23:14.851 --> 23:15.685
About what?

23:16.186 --> 23:17.813
I was praying for you.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.024
Don't bother. I don't believe in prayers.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.778
People only do that
when they feel completely hopeless.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.739
About Ms. Gu…

23:32.744 --> 23:34.287
Apologize to her first.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.961
That's what a strong person does.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.882
Only the weak pity themselves
and refuse to admit they're wrong.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.386
And you're not weak.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.267
You're strong. I know this for a fact.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.104
You and Seo Woo-jae…

24:00.230 --> 24:02.065
You shouldn't have done it

24:02.941 --> 24:04.526
to Ms. Gu and Hyeon-seong.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.863
You…

24:10.991 --> 24:12.868
Did Hae-won tell you?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.035
No.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.039
It showed. I didn't need her to tell me.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.751
It just showed.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.134
Apologize?

24:30.635 --> 24:34.431
Sure. I can apologize over and over again.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.560
But she's the one
who refused to accept my apology.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.103
Why?

24:41.021 --> 24:43.398
So people like you would pity her.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.444
Apologize to her?
I can definitely do that.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.196
Not because I want forgiveness,

24:49.279 --> 24:53.074
but because I pity her for ruining
her own life by living in the past.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.876
Apologize to her.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.882
Apologize sincerely. For your own sake.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.969
Don't lose your chance to be forgiven.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.222
Do you remember what you said?

25:15.972 --> 25:18.058
You truly wished for my happiness.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.310
You said I deserved it.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.192
Then I'm sure you know what you must do.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.045
When did you do all of this?

25:48.421 --> 25:50.590
Since the molds are ready,

25:50.674 --> 25:52.884
we can make as many duplicates as we need.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.886
But I think it'd be best for you to focus

25:54.970 --> 25:57.389
on your signature work
for the upcoming project--

25:57.472 --> 26:00.308
Of course. I'm working on that too.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.311
I know, but you're doing
all those ads and interviews.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.523
So I'm just worried
that you're overworking yourself.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.650
I'd like you to sell them for me.

26:09.276 --> 26:13.113
I noticed people criticize artists
if their works sell well.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.740
But that makes no sense.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.660
Artists don't always have to be poor.

26:18.743 --> 26:19.953
That's true.

26:20.745 --> 26:24.833
Well, your father created art
in a different--

26:24.916 --> 26:29.504
He only considered his work to be art.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.799
Who was he to judge?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.635
Other people's opinions matter the most.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.223
He'd torment himself
and even his son because of that.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.852
But I'm different.

26:52.319 --> 26:53.403
Darn it.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.115
He fell in love
with someone else for a while.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.950
<i>Did you see who that woman was?</i>

26:59.034 --> 27:00.160
<i>I did.</i>

27:00.910 --> 27:02.287
<i>Through a painting.</i>

27:02.370 --> 27:04.622
<i>He drew a painting of her.</i>

27:04.706 --> 27:07.792
<i>I could feel his emotions
through his paintings.</i>

27:12.756 --> 27:14.341
You knew I'd be here, didn't you?

27:15.592 --> 27:17.302
You should've called first.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.013
That painting your husband drew…

27:20.597 --> 27:21.806
Was it of my mom?

27:26.519 --> 27:28.104
Did you tell Ju-yeong about it?

27:28.688 --> 27:29.731
What do you mean?

27:31.399 --> 27:34.235
She threatened to spread rumors
about them. Stop her.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.946
Why would she do that?
Did something happen between you?

27:37.530 --> 27:38.948
It's all your fault!

27:39.032 --> 27:41.451
She and I fell out because of you!

27:41.534 --> 27:43.119
I used to be her only friend.

27:43.203 --> 27:46.623
You stole her from me and hit me
because you hated my mom!

27:46.706 --> 27:48.458
So fix everything!

27:53.380 --> 27:56.257
If she says anything stupid,

27:56.341 --> 27:57.842
it'll be all on you. Okay?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.219
So fix it!

28:01.346 --> 28:03.473
-Isn't that Ms. Gu?
-Let's just go.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.063
Is everything fine between you guys?

28:10.647 --> 28:11.773
Yes.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.335
Mr. Yoon.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.380
Don't get the wrong idea.

28:36.339 --> 28:40.844
It's true that
I once led her to buy the wrong land,

28:40.927 --> 28:43.471
and I'm truly sorry about that.

28:44.222 --> 28:47.934
But I'm not the type
who'd seduce married men.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.521
Okay.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.981
I'm serious.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.151
I know.

28:56.651 --> 28:59.487
You believe me, right? You do, right?

29:00.113 --> 29:01.030
Yes.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.536
Whenever I listen to you,

29:08.079 --> 29:11.499
I can't help but think,
"I see. That could happen."

29:12.917 --> 29:15.295
Everything makes sense, and I believe you.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.050
Wait.

29:29.350 --> 29:32.520
Do you remember
when I said you looked familiar?

29:34.355 --> 29:36.941
I almost remembered just now.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.533
Your house is a mess and there's
nothing but junk food lying around.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.160
I told you to look after Ju-yeong.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.664
What happened to your face?

29:53.833 --> 29:56.544
There's no need for that.
She's staying at the dorm.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.714
Feeding her something good
on the weekends is enough.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.800
And she's all grown up.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.843
When I was her age, I had you--

30:06.554 --> 30:07.764
Seriously…

30:10.767 --> 30:14.687
It's been hard for me too. Really hard!

30:14.771 --> 30:16.981
So why aren't you concerned about me?

30:17.565 --> 30:18.983
And who's to blame for that?

30:19.567 --> 30:22.237
You're the one
making life harder for yourself.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.952
There you go again.
Every time you have nothing to say--

30:29.035 --> 30:30.203
Let her run away.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.664
What's so wrong with that?

30:34.707 --> 30:38.962
They say long battles benefit no one.
Even <i>The Art of War</i> says so.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.343
Why don't you sit down
and have a drink with me?

30:52.642 --> 30:56.062
<i>Does Hui-ju know about what you did to me?</i>

30:57.146 --> 30:58.439
<i>Probably not.</i>

30:58.523 --> 31:02.652
<i>Had she known,
she would've left you long ago.</i>

31:11.744 --> 31:14.080
What were you thinking so hard about?

31:14.163 --> 31:16.666
Gosh. I must've dozed off.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.001
What is it?

31:18.585 --> 31:20.378
Remember you mentioned

31:21.588 --> 31:23.840
an overseas residency program for Seon-u?

31:23.923 --> 31:27.552
Right. There's that
and also an internship.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.138
They're the best
for sports physical therapy.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.806
Is he interested?

31:33.641 --> 31:34.976
I plan to make him go.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.023
Can you look more into it?

31:40.815 --> 31:44.068
Studying abroad will be
a great opportunity for him.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.062
DIVORCE AGREEMENT
HUSBAND: SEO WOO-JAE

32:56.849 --> 32:58.351
You're the one at fault.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.064
So how dare you demand a divorce first?

33:03.940 --> 33:06.401
You will never get back with her
no matter what.

33:09.028 --> 33:11.197
This has nothing to do with her.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.742
I want to break up
because I'm not happy with you.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.869
Are you trying to save face?

33:17.870 --> 33:19.080
You're funny.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.083
You're just a cheater.

33:23.084 --> 33:26.212
No. You don't even have a mistress.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.215
Hui-ju doesn't want you back.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.802
Dr. Jeong Seon-u likes you.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.013
You knew that, didn't you?

33:35.096 --> 33:37.432
You enjoyed it while knowing his feelings.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.100
So what makes you so different?

33:41.060 --> 33:42.770
How foolish of you.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.314
I'm not doing this
because you love someone else.

33:46.232 --> 33:49.277
It can happen. Hui-ju is charming.

33:49.777 --> 33:51.738
I used to admire her too.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.327
But all those lies you told to fool me!

34:01.622 --> 34:03.291
You deceived me,

34:04.292 --> 34:08.004
the very person who trusted you the most.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.300
That's what drives me crazy!

34:12.383 --> 34:14.135
That's exactly why you should stop.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.718
You still confess regularly.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.804
I do.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.974
IT MIGHT RAIN TODAY, DON'T FORGET YOU
UMBRELLA, DON'T SKIP OUT ON LUNCH

35:02.058 --> 35:06.646
Even my mom doesn't remind me
to eat as often as you do.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.026
Let's go eat.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.829
Is that really enough?

35:24.664 --> 35:25.665
Yes.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.669
I wanted to eat this in this neighborhood.

35:31.712 --> 35:32.797
Maybe it's because

35:33.589 --> 35:36.592
this was the first neighborhood
I lived in Seoul.

35:37.260 --> 35:41.764
I'm sick of this place
but always miss it as well.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.599
I'm sick of my hometown,

35:44.225 --> 35:46.060
but I never miss it.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.441
But I do miss my friend from time to time.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.864
Do you mean the one who died?

35:58.781 --> 36:00.241
You met her a couple of times.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.243
The lady who comes to see me.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.413
She's his mom.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.207
Unlike my mom,

36:08.833 --> 36:10.626
she'd do anything for her son.

36:12.086 --> 36:16.215
Thanks to her, he was able to escape
that horrible neighborhood first.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.886
So we lost touch for a long time
and reunited in high school.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.140
He had changed a lot.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.100
But…

36:27.435 --> 36:29.437
instead of being happy for him,

36:30.605 --> 36:32.106
I was jealous.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.571
Gosh. But I was too ashamed
to let my feelings show.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.700
So I acted pretentiously
and caused an accident.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.286
An accident?

36:45.369 --> 36:46.829
It was a car accident.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.874
I didn't have a license.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.878
I encouraged him to do it with me,

36:53.961 --> 36:56.714
but he died and I survived.
So it's all my fault.

37:01.135 --> 37:04.096
I confess not so that we'll be forgiven,

37:04.722 --> 37:06.307
but so that I don't forget it.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.602
What about his mom?

37:09.685 --> 37:11.604
She can't bring herself to forgive me.

37:13.022 --> 37:15.566
Since I know
that's what's keeping her going,

37:17.151 --> 37:19.487
I don't dare to ask for her forgiveness.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.828
Look. I'm sorry about last time.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.415
I knew you were in pain.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.336
I was selfish.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.641
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL CHAIRMAN'S DAUGHTER
IS TERRIBLE AT DANCING

37:57.650 --> 37:58.818
<i>Her dad owns the school.</i>

37:58.901 --> 38:00.820
<i>He put her in the special class.</i>

38:00.903 --> 38:02.905
<i>What about all the sincere students?</i>

38:02.989 --> 38:05.157
<i>They're a bunch of crooks
that favor the rich.</i>

38:05.241 --> 38:06.325
<i>What a shady school.</i>

38:18.421 --> 38:19.380
<i>How is Li-sa?</i>

38:20.756 --> 38:22.591
She won't come out of her room.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.721
Are you certain that Ju-yeong did this?

38:26.804 --> 38:29.348
She's the only one who filmed Li-sa.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.183
But they were friends.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.103
This is such a malicious rumor.
It makes Li-sa look like--

38:34.186 --> 38:36.439
It'll be difficult
to get it deleted from our end.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.816
It may even worsen the situation.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.194
You've met Ju-yeong several times.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.904
Why don't you try persuading her?

38:44.739 --> 38:48.659
We can only make a move
once she deletes the video.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.705
Okay.

39:33.662 --> 39:36.040
So this is how you're helping Ju-yeong?

39:36.874 --> 39:39.085
This is your definition
of taking care of her?

39:42.546 --> 39:45.383
You know what she did to Li-sa, don't you?

39:47.510 --> 39:49.553
Imagine how hurt and upset
she was to do that.

39:53.432 --> 39:56.811
I guess Ju-yeong is
following in your footsteps.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.108
Li-sa was the one who started it.

40:02.191 --> 40:06.028
So? What are you trying to gain
by joining the kids' fight?

40:08.447 --> 40:10.950
I get that you can't understand
how a mother feels.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.452
But where's your conscience as a teacher?

40:13.536 --> 40:16.414
Excuse me. Who are you?

40:16.497 --> 40:18.749
Who are you to barge in here and yap away?

40:20.543 --> 40:21.836
My daughter was her student.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.421
Leave.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.506
You had me fired
and still blame me as a teacher?

40:25.589 --> 40:27.508
So, what is this--

40:27.591 --> 40:29.301
Ask her yourself.

40:29.385 --> 40:32.054
If you're so innocent,
tell her yourself what happened.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.978
What? Do you not want
to drag your family into this?

40:41.480 --> 40:44.859
Then tell Ju-yeong
to delete that video this instant.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.987
Even if Li-sa is to blame,

40:48.070 --> 40:50.531
tell her that doing this
won't do her any good.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.868
Teach her properly
that this was the wrong approach.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.035
Excuse me!

40:55.619 --> 40:57.246
Mom, it's okay.

41:03.752 --> 41:04.795
Gosh.

41:08.757 --> 41:09.758
What's the matter?

41:10.718 --> 41:12.887
Did Ju-yeong do something?

41:13.929 --> 41:16.432
Is it because
I didn't look after her properly?

41:22.354 --> 41:23.314
Goodness.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.126
Do you feel better now?

41:47.254 --> 41:48.297
It's okay.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.760
I understand why you had to go that far.

41:54.803 --> 41:57.806
Nothing's going on
between the manager and me.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.226
Besides, he has
a really pretty girlfriend.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.352
I know.

42:02.019 --> 42:06.065
He's been intentionally uploading more
photos of them together on social media.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.445
Still, you should take down that video.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.573
It won't do you any good.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.413
Because it's not true.

42:23.374 --> 42:27.419
Remember you said
Li-sa looked really cool when dancing?

42:30.047 --> 42:32.800
You know that she's more than good enough

42:33.842 --> 42:35.302
to attend that school.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.099
I just gave her
a taste of her own medicine.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.481
She's being like that
because she's obsessed with you.

42:49.316 --> 42:53.153
You should pity her instead of hating her.

42:54.488 --> 42:57.950
Don't waste your life hating someone.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.205
I'm speaking from experience.

43:04.456 --> 43:05.958
Don't be like me, Ju-yeong.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.929
What are you guys doing, leaving me out?

43:21.223 --> 43:23.267
-Here.
-What's this?

43:26.687 --> 43:27.646
Here.

43:30.399 --> 43:32.276
-Is it good?
-It's so tasty.

43:33.777 --> 43:36.322
You better not leave me out ever again.

43:37.031 --> 43:38.407
You should've called me.

43:38.490 --> 43:39.908
Gosh.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.839
The video has been removed,

45:16.922 --> 45:19.133
and we shut down the anonymous forum.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.635
We'll have Li-sa's grades made public

45:21.718 --> 45:23.846
and put an end to this rumor.

45:23.929 --> 45:24.972
It's been resolved.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.307
Resolved?

45:28.308 --> 45:30.644
Every time Li-sa makes
even the tiniest mistake,

45:32.312 --> 45:36.817
they'll bring up the past
and try to tear her to pieces.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.195
Can we really say it's been resolved?

45:40.279 --> 45:42.239
It's our job to prevent…

45:43.991 --> 45:47.453
that from happening
and defend her even if it happens.

45:49.246 --> 45:50.372
You finished it.

45:51.748 --> 45:53.125
It looks amazing.

45:54.835 --> 45:58.213
My goodness. When did they grow so big?

46:08.098 --> 46:11.143
<i>Mr. Seo, you're active
even when you're not sculpting.</i>

46:11.226 --> 46:14.605
<i>You garnered over 100,000 subscribers
on YouTube fairly quickly.</i>

46:14.688 --> 46:17.983
<i>You're one of the hottest artists
well-received by the public.</i>

46:18.525 --> 46:21.487
<i>Recently, you surprised everyone
by stating that an artist</i>

46:21.570 --> 46:25.491
shouldn't be afraid of their work
being put on the market.

46:25.574 --> 46:28.160
Who would you say influenced you the most?

46:28.243 --> 46:29.495
I'm honored to say

46:29.578 --> 46:32.539
that artist Jeong Hui-ju
was the first buyer of my work.

46:33.248 --> 46:36.418
Through her, I gained confidence
that I was going down the right path.

46:38.921 --> 46:41.048
How ludicrous.

46:43.634 --> 46:47.679
What's done is done.
Stop them from releasing more.

46:49.932 --> 46:50.766
Yes, ma'am.

46:54.978 --> 46:57.856
Where did the feisty, old you go?

46:59.566 --> 47:03.028
Seeing that you look so depressed,
I'm not surprised your husband cheated.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.037
It wasn't easy
to get you a full-time position.

47:12.704 --> 47:16.291
It's far from Seoul, but you'll
get support since it is an art colony.

47:17.918 --> 47:20.671
Look for a house nearby
that can be used as a studio.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.589
What are you doing?

47:22.673 --> 47:26.677
I heard you were fired from the gallery.
Why are you throwing a pity party here?

47:26.760 --> 47:30.013
Just leave.
Go live quietly and peacefully.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.812
And here I thought you were
going to hand me an envelope full of cash.

47:37.854 --> 47:39.106
I'm leaving.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.107
Hey.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.318
Hui-ju is still a member of my family.

47:44.027 --> 47:48.198
If needed, I'll bash her or destroy her.
But I won't let others touch her.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.538
When your elders do you a favor,
accept it. Don't be impudent.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.048
RECOMMENDATION LETTER
NAME: GU HAE-WON

48:06.466 --> 48:09.553
This isn't doing me a favor.
You're trying to send me into exile.

48:19.229 --> 48:22.566
Keep an eye on her
and make sure she's not up to anything.

48:25.277 --> 48:28.864
How could she be so careless
and have a photo taken of her with him?

48:31.199 --> 48:32.367
<i>You didn't know?</i>

48:33.035 --> 48:34.661
Why did you take the photo?

48:39.124 --> 48:40.459
It was a meet-and-greet.

48:40.542 --> 48:42.794
It was public, so anyone could come.

48:43.712 --> 48:45.881
It would've looked weird had I refused.

48:47.132 --> 48:49.343
You should take this more seriously.

48:54.806 --> 48:57.142
He doesn't think twice
about being reckless

48:58.060 --> 49:00.354
because he believes you're being swayed.

49:02.814 --> 49:04.816
I'm not and I don't want to.

49:05.525 --> 49:08.570
Don't get involved with him anymore.
Don't give him any excuses.

49:09.988 --> 49:11.448
What are you saying?

49:13.075 --> 49:14.826
Are you saying I should back out of--

49:14.910 --> 49:17.412
Even my mom found out.
Don't you know what that means?

49:17.496 --> 49:19.122
You should be lying low.

49:19.956 --> 49:21.041
-But--
-He's acting out

49:21.124 --> 49:23.043
because he knows you won't give it up.

49:23.126 --> 49:25.921
And like everyone else,
getting rejected exasperates him.

49:26.004 --> 49:28.965
Backing out of the exhibition now
will cause a huge inconvenience.

49:29.591 --> 49:32.427
I don't want to ruin
Mr. Woo's last exhibition.

49:36.431 --> 49:37.641
Is it that important?

49:37.724 --> 49:40.227
That's not what this is about.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.111
Then choose.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.448
Is it your family or that bastard?

They've assessed the structure

52:33.650 --> 52:35.819
and will begin
the reinforcement work next week.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.865
This area will be
completely transformed by next year.

52:44.244 --> 52:48.832
Why are you talking about what I already
know after calling me all the way here?

52:49.666 --> 52:50.709
To cheer you on.

52:51.918 --> 52:55.589
You're finally realizing the dream
you talked about down there.

52:59.217 --> 53:01.136
I believe we share the same dream.

53:01.219 --> 53:03.597
Many of the multiplex housing units
around here

53:04.681 --> 53:07.851
were bought under
your family members' names.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.270
I thought they'd be a good investment.

53:11.855 --> 53:15.108
I'm going to help out as much as I can
until Taerim Art Center

53:15.191 --> 53:16.735
is well established.

53:17.235 --> 53:18.737
But not after that.

53:19.905 --> 53:23.408
An Hyeon-seong used to be
indecisive and incompetent.

53:23.992 --> 53:27.370
But thanks to you, he's managing
a school and even a foundation.

53:28.496 --> 53:32.542
However, I refuse to watch him waste
the hospital's hard-earned money

53:33.335 --> 53:35.879
on something so useless anymore.

53:38.256 --> 53:40.592
That's up to our mother-in-law to decide.

53:42.844 --> 53:44.012
Right.

53:45.931 --> 53:50.101
She's an experienced businesswoman
who only believes what she sees.

53:51.686 --> 53:53.939
What's the advantage
of living in a digital world?

53:54.522 --> 53:58.026
It's that everything can be traced.

54:01.112 --> 54:03.573
You'd be in a pickle
if she found out that you two

54:03.657 --> 54:05.325
are still close, wouldn't you?

54:06.409 --> 54:07.869
CALL LOGS

54:12.290 --> 54:14.584
From now on, discuss everything with me.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.379
What for?

54:18.588 --> 54:22.133
You and I are nothing short
of unwelcome strangers to her.

54:24.302 --> 54:28.098
I don't care what she thinks
as long as Hyeon-seong stands by my side.

54:30.225 --> 54:34.396
Who do you think she considers
to be her successor? Him or you?

54:35.522 --> 54:38.316
You must know well
since you always cater to her.

54:41.027 --> 54:42.654
Threaten me all you want,

54:42.737 --> 54:45.573
but you'll never be her successor.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.326
So don't kid yourself.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.376
What?

54:57.669 --> 54:58.837
Will you hit me too?

55:00.588 --> 55:03.299
Did you think I didn't know your secret?

55:03.383 --> 55:05.844
You're just a coward
with an inferiority complex

55:06.428 --> 55:08.555
who hits your wife.

55:10.849 --> 55:13.184
Do you think she's enduring it
because she's scared?

55:14.019 --> 55:16.229
Did you think someone as smart as her

55:16.896 --> 55:18.606
didn't keep any evidence?

55:19.107 --> 55:20.650
Don't be mistaken.

55:20.734 --> 55:22.569
She's stronger than you.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.697
She's not consumed by her greed like you.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.074
She has a son to protect.

55:39.961 --> 55:42.005
What did you say? What evidence?

55:42.547 --> 55:44.507
What evidence does she have?

55:44.591 --> 55:46.593
That's what you're curious about?

55:47.594 --> 55:50.930
You don't deserve to be a parent,
you scumbag.

55:52.807 --> 55:54.225
Why do you think

55:55.977 --> 55:58.688
Hyeon-seong took
such great care of his wife's lover?

56:05.695 --> 56:10.366
I have proof that he fixed his rental car
on the day of Woo-jae's accident.

56:11.284 --> 56:13.703
What could it mean? What do you think?

56:21.002 --> 56:22.879
Are you afraid of him going down?

56:23.463 --> 56:27.175
Then tell me.
What proof does my wife have?

56:27.926 --> 56:29.094
Let me go!

56:30.011 --> 56:32.097
Let's be frank with each other now.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.682
You and I are in the same boat.

56:42.273 --> 56:43.274
Hui-ju.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.319
What are you…

57:49.382 --> 57:51.926
It was an accident. I…

58:04.105 --> 58:05.148
What are you doing?

58:05.231 --> 58:06.566
There was an accident.

58:08.067 --> 58:09.360
Yes, that's the place.

58:10.904 --> 58:13.740
No. It's just me.

58:25.376 --> 58:26.920
He fell five stories.

58:31.466 --> 58:35.637
He has multiple fractures, no
consciousness, and his pupils are dilated.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.526
<i>There was no need to hide it.</i>

58:50.068 --> 58:53.154
Once he regains consciousness,
they'll find out I was with him.

58:53.238 --> 58:55.323
Why did you lie to them?

58:55.406 --> 58:59.410
He willingly climbed up a building
that was being demolished.

58:59.494 --> 59:01.663
He was the one who slipped and fell.

59:03.164 --> 59:04.499
There's no lie here.

59:04.582 --> 59:05.583
No.

59:06.793 --> 59:10.171
I could've grabbed his hand.
I could, but--

59:10.255 --> 59:12.048
I would've pushed him away anyway.

59:12.131 --> 59:15.843
I won't let anyone harm you.

59:24.644 --> 59:27.438
Hello? Yes, this is he.

59:28.565 --> 59:31.234
No. I'm nearby.

59:34.612 --> 59:36.489
Wait at home. I'll call you later.

59:52.839 --> 59:54.716
HYEON-SEONG

1:00:00.013 --> 1:00:03.057
What in the world happened?
Explain it to me.

1:00:03.141 --> 1:00:06.519
It seems he slipped and fell
off the gallery construction site.

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:11.733
The police are investigating right now.
I'll go look into it.

1:00:13.943 --> 1:00:14.819
Come in.

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:21.743
His brain pressure is too high
due to a massive hemorrhage.

1:00:21.826 --> 1:00:25.079
We've administered mannitol
and opened up his skull.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:27.165
Get an OR ready.

1:00:27.248 --> 1:00:29.375
What if it goes wrong?
Leave it to someone else.

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:31.544
I'm the most competent doctor here.

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:32.879
That's not what I meant.

1:00:32.962 --> 1:00:36.633
Due to multiple hemorrhages,
we can't operate on him immediately.

1:00:36.716 --> 1:00:38.801
For now, we should monitor him to be safe.

1:00:38.885 --> 1:00:40.470
I'm aware of that,

1:00:40.553 --> 1:00:43.181
but you're saying you won't do anything!

1:00:43.264 --> 1:00:45.725
Even if it's a success,
he could get paralyzed or--

1:00:45.808 --> 1:00:48.061
That's why I'll operate on him.

1:00:49.145 --> 1:00:52.065
Even if something happens,
I'll take responsibility.

1:00:54.275 --> 1:00:56.819
Because I'm his family.

1:01:57.922 --> 1:02:01.217
<i>Unlike me, you don't need to wait.</i>

1:02:01.926 --> 1:02:04.262
<i>You need to make the decision.</i>

1:02:06.055 --> 1:02:09.100
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:16.149

1:02:23.072 --> 1:02:25.616
How is Mr. Lee doing?

1:02:27.493 --> 1:02:28.870
Why were you with him?

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:33.082
What were you two scheming?

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:34.292
Scheming?

1:02:34.876 --> 1:02:36.794
I was just walking by when I saw it.

1:02:40.256 --> 1:02:42.925
Is this area cursed or something?

1:02:45.052 --> 1:02:46.429
Bad things happen here often.

1:02:47.847 --> 1:02:49.265
You were just walking by?

1:02:50.641 --> 1:02:54.604
All right. I'll find out for myself
about what happened.

1:02:54.687 --> 1:02:56.647
I advise you not to do that.

1:03:01.194 --> 1:03:03.738
You'll only put Ms. Jeong in a pickle.

1:03:05.281 --> 1:03:06.407
What?

1:03:06.491 --> 1:03:08.326
This was just an accident.

1:03:09.577 --> 1:03:11.078
Let's keep it that way.

1:03:16.793 --> 1:03:20.004
I'm sure it won't be that hard
since you've already done it before.

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:26.469
That's best for Hui-ju.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:29.639
Mr. Seo.

1:03:31.015 --> 1:03:32.517
You should be careful

1:03:33.726 --> 1:03:35.394
how you address my wife.

1:03:36.020 --> 1:03:37.313
I'm afraid I can't.

1:03:39.899 --> 1:03:41.192
You see,

1:03:42.777 --> 1:03:44.612
we still have lingering feelings.

1:03:45.196 --> 1:03:46.280
Feelings?

1:03:47.448 --> 1:03:48.783
What kind of feelings?

1:03:51.369 --> 1:03:53.120
Are you sure it's not just you?

1:03:57.708 --> 1:04:02.046
Lust-crazed hormones
are the only thing you're feeling.

1:04:04.215 --> 1:04:07.051
Do you still not know why
she left you and came back to me?

1:04:07.927 --> 1:04:09.720
I guess you don't remember that part.

1:04:24.777 --> 1:04:28.197
INCORRECT PATTERN

1:04:28.281 --> 1:04:31.951
SEO WOO-JAE

1:04:42.211 --> 1:04:44.922
<i>You finally picked up.
I called you many times.</i>

1:04:48.342 --> 1:04:50.386
He's still undergoing surgery.

1:04:50.469 --> 1:04:51.679
What did…

1:04:53.139 --> 1:04:54.181
the police say?

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:56.267
<i>I'll tell you in person.</i>

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:03.107
I can't do that.
My husband is home, so I can't--

1:05:03.190 --> 1:05:04.483
<i>Why are you lying?</i>

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:08.279
I know he's not home right now.

1:05:11.782 --> 1:05:14.285
Come out. Or should I go inside?

1:05:48.027 --> 1:05:49.820
I need to step out for a bit.

1:05:50.696 --> 1:05:51.739
Don't go.

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:56.827
It's late, and Dad's not home. Don't go.

1:05:56.911 --> 1:06:00.081
It won't take long. I'm sorry, Li-sa.

1:06:01.457 --> 1:06:02.333
Mom.

1:06:22.019 --> 1:06:23.062
Come inside.

1:06:34.281 --> 1:06:36.492
He's still undergoing surgery.

1:06:38.285 --> 1:06:39.787
If something goes wrong--

1:06:39.870 --> 1:06:42.707
Nothing will go wrong.
Why do you think I was there?

1:06:43.958 --> 1:06:47.753
He said there was a way
to kick you out of the family,

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:49.255
as long as I helped him.

1:06:57.013 --> 1:07:01.142
All of our texts and calls are in here.

1:07:02.935 --> 1:07:04.770
He was blackmailing you.

1:07:05.938 --> 1:07:08.441
He tried to threaten you
as you ran away and slipped.

1:07:09.525 --> 1:07:10.693
He brought it on himself.

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:18.784
It's better that he fell.

1:07:20.119 --> 1:07:21.746
Otherwise, I would've killed him.

1:07:28.586 --> 1:07:30.504
I will kill anyone

1:07:32.298 --> 1:07:33.966
who dares to harm you.

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:52.026
No--

1:07:52.568 --> 1:07:53.486
Stop--

1:08:28.938 --> 1:08:30.272
This is wrong.

1:08:31.065 --> 1:08:33.192
We shouldn't do this. This is--

1:08:36.612 --> 1:08:37.655
No.

1:08:38.614 --> 1:08:40.741
What you're doing right now…

1:08:41.575 --> 1:08:44.870
You can't justify your actions
by saying it was all out of love.

1:08:44.954 --> 1:08:48.124
You don't truly love me. Please wake up.

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:51.669
You don't love me. Wake up!

1:08:51.752 --> 1:08:53.420
Who are you to judge my feelings?

1:08:55.214 --> 1:08:56.423
I still love you.

1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:01.637
No, you don't!

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:03.722
You're just upset that I rejected you!

1:09:03.806 --> 1:09:05.933
You're just desperate!

1:09:06.016 --> 1:09:09.562
You're mistaking it for love!

1:09:09.645 --> 1:09:12.106
This is wrong!

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:16.152
No, Woo-jae! This isn't love.

1:09:17.319 --> 1:09:19.947
Please stop it. This is wrong.

1:09:20.447 --> 1:09:22.199
This is wrong, Woo-jae!

1:11:25.698 --> 1:11:28.033
Did you go somewhere this late at night?

1:11:29.076 --> 1:11:30.577
What is going on?

1:11:37.584 --> 1:11:39.295
<i>Do you trust your husband?</i>

1:11:40.212 --> 1:11:41.922
<i>He's a man, after all.</i>

1:11:42.506 --> 1:11:44.216
<i>You don't think he can't cheat too?</i>

1:11:46.552 --> 1:11:49.013
What have you done to him?

1:12:00.733 --> 1:12:07.740
EPISODE 14
DID NOT LOVE ANYONE

1:12:40.773 --> 1:12:42.816
<i>Do you know why betrayal is so cruel?</i>

1:12:42.900 --> 1:12:45.527
You met my mom, didn't you? Why?

1:12:45.611 --> 1:12:46.737
You really don't know?

1:12:48.489 --> 1:12:51.116
<i>Let's end this quickly.
You'll be better off that way.</i>

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:53.744
<i>I also had a chance
to become a mother once.</i>

1:12:53.827 --> 1:12:56.330
<i>If you were worried,
you should've gone right away.</i>

1:12:56.413 --> 1:12:58.082
That's a lie!

1:13:00.084 --> 1:13:02.503
<i>You can't escape from me.</i>

1:13:02.586 --> 1:13:03.754
That's enough!

1:13:03.837 --> 1:13:05.964
<i>Those two left with each other again.</i>

1:13:06.048 --> 1:13:08.759
Lies. Don't lie to me!

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:10.844
<i>My story…</i>

1:13:14.556 --> 1:13:16.058
<i>ends here.</i>

1:13:16.642 --> 1:13:18.060
<i>What a dull ending.</i>

1:13:20.145 --> 1:13:21.146
<i>Isn't it?</i>

1:13:23.565 --> 1:13:28.570
