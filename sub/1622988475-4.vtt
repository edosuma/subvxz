NARRATOR:
Previously on Why Women Kill...

00:06.074 --> 00:07.641
-(panting)
-Oh!

00:09.377 --> 00:11.545
We tell the neighbors
that Mrs. Yost went away.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.547
Or better still,
we could arrange

00:13.581 --> 00:15.149
for some of them
to see her leave.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.750
ALMA:
They'll start to look for her,

00:16.784 --> 00:19.620
miles and miles away
from our front yard.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.522
RITA:
He put a codicil in his will

00:21.555 --> 00:23.224
saying that if I would
embarrass him

00:23.257 --> 00:24.725
with any men
he didn't approve of,

00:24.758 --> 00:26.394
he would disinherit me.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.029
She'd be disinherited if she was
caught in a compromising

00:29.063 --> 00:30.764
-position.
-You're asking me to screw her?

00:30.798 --> 00:33.033
-So, that's her?
-Well, you got your answer.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.468
-Now, let's go.
-Wait.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.736
God, I am so stupid.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.770
Hey. Hey!

00:36.804 --> 00:37.805
I'm his lover.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.241
You cheated on me with that?

00:40.274 --> 00:41.342
You deserve each other.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.078
It's over.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.247
We have an opening
for a new member.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.048
I nominate Alma Fillcot.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.484
She is very, very nice.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.988
*

01:00.294 --> 01:03.164
(phone ringing)

01:03.197 --> 01:05.299
NARRATOR:
From the moment the phone rang,

01:05.333 --> 01:08.636
Alma Fillcot
knew she was in trouble.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.139
As every housewife knows,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.473
good news...

01:12.506 --> 01:14.542
never calls before 9:00.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.778
-Hello?
-GRACE: Thank God you're home.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.213
It's Grace. I...

01:19.247 --> 01:21.081
I called you
ten times yesterday.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.816
I was out of town.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.285
What's wrong?

01:24.318 --> 01:25.586
Oh, nothing much.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.455
Except you're about
to be ambushed.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.022
Ambushed?

01:29.056 --> 01:31.192
As you know,
I have been campaigning for you

01:31.225 --> 01:33.026
to get the open spot
in the Garden Club.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.328
But...

01:34.362 --> 01:36.330
well, Rita Castillo
is not convinced

01:36.364 --> 01:38.632
that you'll be a, um...

01:38.666 --> 01:40.268
a good fit.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.069
Oh, she... she's not?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.471
I begged her
to give you a chance.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.673
So, she's decided
to drop by your home

01:45.706 --> 01:48.108
for a surprise inspection.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.244
Rita is coming to my home?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.313
With the entire
nominating committee.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.747
Today at 3:00.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.516
My house is a mess.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.552
Well, then don't spend
another second talking to me.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.156
Grace, you-you are,
you are a true pal.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.424
Happy to help.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.025
But if you tell Rita
I warned you,

02:05.058 --> 02:06.260
I will denounce you as a liar.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.162
Oh, I understand completely.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.763
I'm so glad.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.366
Well, good luck.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.272
*

02:18.306 --> 02:20.107
NARRATOR:
Alma raced into her living room,

02:20.140 --> 02:23.744
determined to clean
like she'd never cleaned before.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.715
But as she looked around
at the worn sofa

02:27.748 --> 02:31.619
and chipped knickknacks
that filled her modest home,

02:31.652 --> 02:35.489
Alma realized hasty housework

02:35.523 --> 02:38.626
wouldn't be enough
to impress the chic ladies

02:38.659 --> 02:40.628
of the Garden Club.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.733
What she really needed
was to fill her home

02:45.766 --> 02:47.401
with lovely things.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.803
And with no time to go shopping,

02:49.837 --> 02:53.073
Alma did the next best thing.

02:53.106 --> 02:56.377
She went to a dead woman's home,

02:56.410 --> 02:58.312
and began borrowing.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.316
*

03:04.618 --> 03:06.654
*

03:25.473 --> 03:29.710
NARRATOR: While Alma was busy
committing theft in Los Angeles,

03:29.743 --> 03:32.646
her previous crime
was being discovered

03:32.680 --> 03:35.115
hundreds of miles away.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.184
Who found it?

03:37.217 --> 03:40.488
Well, some kid went fishing this
morning hoping to catch a trout.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.256
Hooked a Dodge instead.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.327
So, what do we think
happened here?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.596
Car's registered
to a Carol Yost in L.A.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.197
My guess?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.232
She was on a road trip,
fell asleep at the wheel,

03:52.266 --> 03:53.734
then drove into the lake.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.804
Any sign of a body?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.506
Not yet.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.140
Guys.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.109
Come here.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.948
Look at this.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.352
*

04:15.088 --> 04:17.658
Looks like she had company.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.898
-(barking)
-Rocco, come-- Hey!

04:24.932 --> 04:26.367
Rocco.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.601
Hey.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.570
-God. Not in Alma's flowers.
-(barks)

04:29.603 --> 04:31.572
She'll lose her mind.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.307
(door closes)

04:37.110 --> 04:39.012
Alma?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.916
-Rocco, come on.
-(whimpers)

04:43.884 --> 04:45.986
(keys jingle)

04:46.019 --> 04:48.021
-Alma.
-(yelps)

04:48.055 --> 04:49.723
Lord. You scared me.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.959
-Is that Mrs. Yost's lamp?
-Yes.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.794
But I don't have time
to explain.

04:53.827 --> 04:54.962
We're under attack!

04:56.497 --> 04:57.931
What? By who?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.434
Alma.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.869
-Stop.
-(scoffs)

05:01.902 --> 05:03.103
Hey.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.439
I insist you tell me
what's going on.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.608
If you must know,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.643
the ladies from the Garden Club
are coming over today.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.844
To judge us.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.780
(scoffs)

05:12.813 --> 05:14.348
Alma...

05:14.382 --> 05:16.717
(panting)

05:16.750 --> 05:18.352
(door closes)

05:20.053 --> 05:22.823
(panting):
What does that got to do
with Mrs. Yost's things?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.425
Our house is drab.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.360
It's filled to the rafters
with shoddy bric-a-brac.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.996
But Mrs. Yost,
on the other hand,

05:29.029 --> 05:31.064
she had lovely things.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.633
She possessed the kind of taste

05:32.666 --> 05:34.602
that the Garden Club ladies
will respect.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.670
That's your excuse to steal?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.071
To impress a bunch of snobs?

05:38.105 --> 05:39.807
Bertram.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.544
If you will help me
through this very trying day,

05:43.577 --> 05:45.613
I promise...

05:45.646 --> 05:48.449
I will stop complaining about
all those people you've killed.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.783
Think about it.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.985
From this moment on,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.987
we'll be even.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.992
What a lovely vase.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.494
Okay.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.030
(furniture thumping)

06:03.063 --> 06:05.298
Hey. What's going on?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.402
N-No, stop.
You can't take my sofa.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.037
It's not your sofa.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.572
It's mine, remember?

06:11.605 --> 06:13.474
I paid for everything
in this apartment,

06:13.507 --> 06:15.643
which you are leaving. Today.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.344
Oh, you're still mad, huh?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.579
Just a skosh.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.714
Take these bottles to the truck.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.950
And, you, take the suits.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.685
You're taking my suits?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.987
Oh, come on, Rita. Have a heart.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.589
I do have a heart.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.558
It's a shame you had to find out
by breaking it.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.726
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Now, I...

06:32.760 --> 06:34.462
I know I messed up,

06:34.495 --> 06:36.730
but if you get rid
of these guys,

06:36.764 --> 06:37.898
then I'll make it up to you.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.335
You want to screw your way
out of this jam? Fine.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.838
But I'm not the one
you need to seduce.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.609
You're still trying to get me
in bed with Carlo's daughter?

06:48.642 --> 06:51.945
If you can pretend
to be interested in a fat girl,

06:51.979 --> 06:54.848
you can fake a bit of passion
for a middle-aged woman.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.917
I never faked it with you, baby.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.951
Ah!

06:57.985 --> 06:59.920
Oh, you meant Catherine.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.855
Leave nothing!

07:02.856 --> 07:03.891
No, wait.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.828
Rita, please.

07:07.861 --> 07:08.896
Don't do this.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.898
Catherine is out to destroy me.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.766
And she'll succeed,
unless I get some leverage.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.902
And you are the only one
who can help me do that.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.436
But do I have to sleep with her?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.939
A photo of Catherine
in bed with a young buck

07:18.972 --> 07:20.541
would disinherit her.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.776
That's how I'll blackmail her
out of my life.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.578
And you can have
your suits back.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.679
What could be simpler?

07:25.713 --> 07:27.981
But I'm an actor, not a whore.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.750
Scooter, I've seen your acting.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.419
I wouldn't be so quick to
rule out a more viable career.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.856
Go to hell.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.525
I don't need you.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.593
We'll see about that.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.794
Oh.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.796
And I paid for this, too.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.931
SCOOTER:
Hey!

07:48.936 --> 07:51.471
Hey, Mrs. Ayashi.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.709
(phone rings)

07:55.743 --> 07:56.910
Hello.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.111
MAN:
Is this Vern Loomis?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.680
Sure. Who's this?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.381
The guy whose life you ruined.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.983
You'll have to be more specific.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.752
You think this is funny?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.053
Sophie's going to divorce me.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.621
Ah...

08:07.655 --> 08:09.523
This must be Mr. Hemple.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.592
And she told my boss.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.694
Then he fired me because of you.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.062
No, Sid.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.697
He fired you because
you were knocking boots

08:16.730 --> 08:18.431
with his secretary.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.100
You're going to pay
for what you did to me, Loomis.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.468
Oh, so dearly.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.903
(laughs)

08:22.936 --> 08:24.404
"Oh, so dearly"?

08:24.437 --> 08:25.939
Who taught you
how to make death threats?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.474
-Noël Coward?
-(line clicks)

08:29.042 --> 08:30.510
Hello?

08:30.544 --> 08:32.412
Sid?

08:32.445 --> 08:34.014
(scoffs)

08:36.016 --> 08:37.551
(sighs)

08:41.689 --> 08:43.757
(door bells jingle)

08:45.358 --> 08:46.526
DEE:
Scooter.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.428
What's with the getup?

08:48.461 --> 08:50.363
Long story.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.899
Come on.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.969
So, what do you want?

08:56.003 --> 08:58.338
Rita threw me out
of my apartment.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.339
Huh.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.141
Was it something I said?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.710
-That's not funny.
-Hey.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.944
You lied to me.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.813
You can't blame me
for getting sore.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.514
Okay.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.982
It's all my fault.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.720
So, what do you need?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.021
Money.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.390
I'm down to my last 22 cents.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.759
Boy.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.993
You got some nerve.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.595
I know.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.530
But I'm desperate.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.766
I could end up on the streets.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.402
(sighs)

09:30.570 --> 09:32.840
That's all I got. Take it.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.749
Thank you. (sniffling)

09:41.782 --> 09:43.483
Scooter, don't.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.352
I never meant to upset you.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.055
I just thought
we were having fun.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.323
You were having fun.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.859
I was falling in love.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.295
I didn't know.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.999
I'm sorry.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.837
Maybe this turned out
for the best.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.572
There's got to be someone
out there

10:05.605 --> 10:06.907
who'll treat you better
than I did.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.543
Yeah. You may be onto something.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.883
BERTRAM:
What on earth?

10:15.916 --> 10:18.652
Did you take another one
of her dresses?

10:18.686 --> 10:21.554
Our house isn't the only thing
that needs to look good today.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.324
(sighs) Such a difference
in this room.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.927
Do you want me to take the rest
of our things to the attic?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.862
Hmm?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.665
-Alma?
-Yes.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.000
Take it to the attic.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.434
But...

10:35.368 --> 10:37.037
That should go, too.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.740
BERTRAM:
The portrait of our family?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.541
-Why?
-The woman in that picture

10:41.574 --> 10:43.744
is not Garden Club material.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.078
(Bertram scoffs)

10:45.112 --> 10:47.080
Take it down.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.882
(stammers)

10:48.916 --> 10:50.984
It's just for one night.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.520
Fine.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.388
It just seems ridiculous.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.459
Oh, shoot.
I forgot about that.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.593
Too bad.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.529
-Back it goes.
-No, wait.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.098
I've got a better idea.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.767
Come with me.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.072
*

11:12.105 --> 11:15.475
Now, this is a painting.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.779
-I like our picture better.
-How can you compare them?

11:18.812 --> 11:21.014
Well, our portrait
says you value family.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.350
Uh, you have a loving
husband and daughter.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.386
I doubt that's going to impress
the ladies of the Garden Club.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.921
But this...

11:27.955 --> 11:31.358
This will help convince them
that we're sophisticates,

11:31.391 --> 11:33.426
that we've been to Paris.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.796
Why do you want to join a club
you can only get into

11:35.829 --> 11:37.865
by pretending to be someone
you're not?

11:37.898 --> 11:40.400
This painting
may not be who I am,

11:40.433 --> 11:42.602
but it's who I yearn to be.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.672
Which is a healthier dream
than some I could mention.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.040
You said you'd stop
bringing that up.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.876
If you helped me.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.444
Will you take the painting down
or not?

11:52.579 --> 11:54.915
Fine. I just hope
it's all worth it.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.416
Yes, of course.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.019
It's the one touch
the room needs.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.354
It was a stroke of genius
to come back for it.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.424
(vehicle approaching)

12:07.127 --> 12:09.529
*

12:13.566 --> 12:15.302
Oh, dear.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.378
Good God.
Why are the police here?

12:25.412 --> 12:26.814
ALMA:
I don't know.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.949
But let's not discuss it
in front of the window.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.120
Maybe they're investigating
Mrs. Yost's disappearance.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.687
Of course.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.889
You're right. This is good.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.457
This is what we wanted
to happen.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.892
Not while we're robbing
her house.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.627
Right.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.929
-(doorbell rings)
-(gasps)

12:48.501 --> 12:50.303
-(knocking)
-LAPD!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.440
You see anything?

12:53.473 --> 12:54.808
Nope.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.749
(knocking on door)

13:02.782 --> 13:04.852
-Psst.
-Shh!

13:04.885 --> 13:06.519
(whispering): Let's head
out the back, all right?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.455
Grab the painting first.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.722
You want me to steal it
with the police

13:09.756 --> 13:11.091
literally on the doorstep?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.993
We're not stealing it.
We're just borrowing it.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.995
Yes, I'm sure they'll understand
the distinction.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.430
-Regardless, I need it.
-(doorbell rings)

13:17.464 --> 13:19.366
Okay.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.800
Just give me two minutes.
All right?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.402
I'll help you get out of here.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.737
-What are you going to do?
-Shh.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.911
Alma.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.648
Check that window.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.922
*

13:54.001 --> 13:55.568
Yoo-hoo!

13:55.602 --> 13:56.836
Officers.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.005
Hello.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.141
Yes. Hi.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.509
Can I help you?

14:02.542 --> 14:03.944
Well...

14:03.977 --> 14:05.745
Maybe. Do you know the lady
who lives here?

14:05.778 --> 14:07.981
Which, this? Yes, this one.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.350
Oh, yes. Mrs. Yost.
Of course, yes.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.718
Why do you ask?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.586
Well, when was the last time
you saw her?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.589
Um, two days ago.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.391
She was leaving on a trip.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.960
Somewhere up north, I think.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.896
Was she traveling by herself?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.631
Yes. Yes.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.467
My-my husband, um,
saw her leave, actually.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.103
And so did our neighbor
across the street.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.372
Is-is everything...

14:32.405 --> 14:33.941
Is everything all right?

14:33.974 --> 14:35.475
Well, we're not sure.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.677
Her car was found
near San Luis Obispo, in a lake.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.549
A lake?! Oh, the news...

14:42.582 --> 14:44.784
It's just...
(mumbling hysterically)

14:44.817 --> 14:45.852
(screams)

14:45.885 --> 14:48.755
Terrible. Lakes are so...

14:48.788 --> 14:50.023
deep, it's-- I'm okay.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.959
-You-you sure?
-Yes.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.026
I'm so sorry. (chuckles)

14:53.060 --> 14:54.794
You seem pretty emotional.

14:54.827 --> 14:58.631
Oh, yes. Well, I am...

14:58.665 --> 15:01.468
going through the change.
You know?

15:04.637 --> 15:06.573
So, was Mrs. Yost

15:06.606 --> 15:08.775
planning to meet anyone
up north?

15:08.808 --> 15:09.909
No.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.545
Why? Was she seen with someone?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.846
-Not that we know of.
-No.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.682
But there were footprints
on the riverbank.

15:15.715 --> 15:16.984
Two sets.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.086
Really?

15:19.119 --> 15:20.787
So, she might still be alive.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.089
Don't worry.
We'll keep looking for her.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.623
Oh. (chuckles)

15:23.656 --> 15:25.392
Aren't you dedicated?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.394
(chuckles nervously)

15:27.427 --> 15:29.829
If you gentlemen will excuse me,

15:29.862 --> 15:32.065
-I'm expecting guests shortly.
-Of course.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.434
Here's my card. If you should
hear from Mrs. Yost,

15:34.467 --> 15:36.536
-give me a call.
-Of course. Thank you.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.804
And, uh, ma'am.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.072
Don't be embarrassed.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.075
Hey, my mom is
going through the change.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.544
She sweats
even more than you do.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.314
How gallant of you.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.786
(phone rings)

15:53.820 --> 15:55.822
-Hello?
-DEE: Hey. It's me.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.625
-Got plans for lunch?
-Yeah.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.061
I thought I'd leave here at 1:00
and head over to your diner.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.529
My shift ends at 12:30.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.830
Well, that's too bad. You know?

16:03.863 --> 16:05.398
I was looking forward
to seeing you.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.668
Well, I could always stay
and have lunch with you.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.703
I'd like that, very much.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.839
It's sort of romantic,
when you think about it.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.042
Having our first date
at the place we met.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.044
Hey, what now?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.079
See you at 1:00.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.713
Did-did you say date?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.383
Hello?

16:23.416 --> 16:24.851
You son of a bitch.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.754
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.357
You call yourself a detective?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.592
You know who Scooter's
cleaning lady was?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.428
She was a 20-year-old in a wig.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.696
You knew?

16:36.729 --> 16:38.931
Why didn't you tell me?

16:38.965 --> 16:40.933
I talked to the girl.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.002
Told her she could do better
than a pretty boy

16:43.036 --> 16:45.072
who makes her dress up
like Ma Kettle.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.440
She got the message
and dumped him.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.875
What's her name?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.111
Why do you want to know?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.080
She humiliated me.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.448
I want to see her punished.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.616
She's a good kid.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.885
Leave her alone.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.520
Mr. Loomis.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.422
Tell me her name,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.324
and I'll make it
worth your while.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.526
Nice try, but I can't be bought.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.794
Please.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.763
Everyone has a price.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.067
So how much did Mr. Castillo
pay for you?

17:14.101 --> 17:16.069
I beg your pardon.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.938
It's obvious,
you never loved him.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.540
You only married him
because you knew

17:20.573 --> 17:22.409
he'd buy you pretty things.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.945
But that didn't fill up
that hole in your soul.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.047
So, you got yourself a gigolo.

17:28.081 --> 17:31.651
Fooled yourself into thinking
that he loved you.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.686
Now, you know he didn't.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.090
And so, you're starting to panic
because you finally learned

17:37.124 --> 17:39.326
that the real thing
ain't for sale.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.429
And the guys who might have
loved you back in the day

17:42.462 --> 17:44.564
are now only interested in...

17:44.597 --> 17:46.899
fresher produce.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.803
You can't speak to me that way.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.840
No one speaks to me that way.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.443
Well then, no one's
been telling you the truth.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.315
*

18:03.550 --> 18:04.817
What did the police say?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.354
They found Mrs. Yost's car.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.888
That's all?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.657
You were talking to them
for a very long time.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.724
You looked upset.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.493
Of course I looked upset.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.562
I just found out
that my neighbor is missing.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.063
Well, I mean, we almost left
your purse in the car.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.731
I was wondering if
we'd forgotten anything else.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.032
If they were onto us.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.934
They're not onto us.
Just calm down.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.436
Sorry. Yes.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.506
I'll just go
and take the rest of our family

18:26.539 --> 18:27.540
up to the attic.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.075
Bertie?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.610
Yes, dear?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.779
I was right about the painting.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.416
It really does bring
the whole room together.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.785
Yes, dear.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.392
So I was thinking after this,
we could go to a movie.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.894
The new Abbott and Costello
is playing down the street.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.563
That sound good?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.367
Sure. (clears throat)

18:55.134 --> 18:56.803
Okay. What gives?

18:56.836 --> 18:58.438
What do you mean?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.773
Ever since you got here,
I've been doing all the talking.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.342
Where's the sarcasm?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.543
The snide banter?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.478
Guess I'm a...

19:05.512 --> 19:07.079
I'm a little nervous.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.081
On the phone,
you said this was a date.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.117
Yeah. So?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.820
Yeah. So,
it-it's been a while for me.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.855
That doesn't make sense.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.590
You're such a nice guy.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.492
There must be tons of girls
wanting to snap you up.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.561
Yeah, well... (chuckles)

19:21.594 --> 19:25.298
Surely, you must have had
someone special.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.534
There was this one girl.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.369
We were engaged.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.904
What happened?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.775
I went to war,

19:35.808 --> 19:37.910
and she didn't like the guy
who came back.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.814
You must have seen
a lot of death, huh?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.352
Well, it was a war.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.020
If there's no death, it's just
guys in helmets on vacation.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.489
There we go.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.990
There's my snide banter.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.394
(both laughing)

19:54.427 --> 19:57.330
(indistinct chatter)

19:58.898 --> 20:00.600
JUDY:
Here you go, mister.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.436
One chuck steak, very rare.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.405
Thanks.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.573
Oh, and, miss?

20:06.606 --> 20:08.575
Yeah?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.878
-I'm gonna need a knife.
-Sure.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.422
(tires squeal)

20:28.428 --> 20:30.497
*

20:31.964 --> 20:33.466
(barking)

20:34.934 --> 20:37.504
Bertram, they're here.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.507
Put the kettle on
and get your jacket.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.609
You weren't this nervous
when the police showed up.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.943
There's not a cop alive
who scares me

20:43.976 --> 20:45.978
as much as Rita Castillo does.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.615
What a shabby little house.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.550
Oh, but the garden's lovely.
Don't you think?

20:52.485 --> 20:55.054
Daisies, ferns and poppies?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.523
God.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.425
Why doesn't she
just hang a sign saying,

20:58.458 --> 20:59.592
"We're middle class"?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.528
Someone's in a mood.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.096
Sorry.
It's been one of those days.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.966
Well, just don't
take it out on Alma. All right?

21:06.999 --> 21:10.470
It's bad enough we're
showing up here unannounced.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.305
-(doorbell rings)
-Okay.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.775
Ladies.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.944
ALL:
Hello.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.412
What a surprise.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.881
I know you expected
a formal interview

21:21.914 --> 21:25.017
with the membership committee,
but Rita decided...

21:25.051 --> 21:29.121
We decided to just drop by.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.858
Get a sense of your home,
and how you live.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.926
You know? See the real you.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.896
(chuckling):
Well, here I am.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.598
Do come in.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.600
Please make yourselves
comfortable. Hello.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.902
(chuckling):
Right. Hello.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.472
Did we catch you at a bad time?

21:45.505 --> 21:47.874
Oh, no. I-I-I was...

21:47.907 --> 21:49.376
just cleaning.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.543
In that?

21:50.577 --> 21:52.379
Oh. (stammers) Yes.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.548
I, uh, well,
I'm stopping by my church later

21:55.582 --> 21:57.950
with some homemade scones
for their bake sale.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.087
When they're out of the oven,
perhaps you'd like to try some.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.422
(bell dings)

22:02.455 --> 22:04.591
And they're done.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.593
What perfect timing.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.462
-A little too perfect.
-(clears throat)

22:14.401 --> 22:16.703
Now that we have our beverages,

22:16.736 --> 22:18.705
can I offer you
a tour in my garden?

22:18.738 --> 22:20.973
No need.
We saw it on our way in.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.476
Are you sure you saw
the whole garden?

22:23.510 --> 22:24.711
It's not a large property.

22:24.744 --> 22:28.515
Alma. What a nice piano.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.383
You know, I used to play.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.118
-Oh.
-But my manicurist
told me to stop.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.686
I kept breaking my nails.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.987
ALMA:
Speaking of nails,

22:35.021 --> 22:37.123
how do you ladies
keep your hands so lovely

22:37.156 --> 22:38.858
and tend to your gardens?

22:38.891 --> 22:41.994
Mine are just a fright
from all the weeding and thorns.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.864
(all laughing)

22:45.998 --> 22:47.767
Did I say something funny?

22:47.800 --> 22:48.735
Oh. (chuckles)

22:48.768 --> 22:50.002
They're just amused

22:50.036 --> 22:51.871
because you think
we do our own gardening.

22:51.904 --> 22:55.307
(chuckling):
Oh. I get it.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.644
I just, I just assumed

22:57.677 --> 22:59.946
because you're all so fond
of flowers...

22:59.979 --> 23:01.614
I'm also fond of roast chickens.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.850
Doesn't mean I want
to chop their heads off.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.685
Why not? You'd be so good at it.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.955
Alma, I love all
of your knickknacks.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.356
ALMA:
Oh.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.891
Especially
that painting of Paris.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.926
You know, it's my favorite city.

23:13.960 --> 23:14.961
Have you ever been?

23:14.994 --> 23:17.664
Oh, yes. Oh...

23:17.697 --> 23:18.865
Many times.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.334
Many times?

23:22.368 --> 23:25.538
Tell me, where do you like
to stay when you're in Paris?

23:26.506 --> 23:27.774
Oh, we-- Oh...

23:27.807 --> 23:29.509
Well, we always...

23:29.542 --> 23:30.710
Bertram, help me.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.580
Where do we stay in Paris?

23:33.613 --> 23:36.449
Hotel? Pied-à-terre?

23:36.483 --> 23:37.884
Oh, that's it. Yes.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.552
That's the one.
The Hotel Pied-à-Terre.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.554
It's so charming.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.426
The "Hotel Pied-à-Terre."

23:49.796 --> 23:51.097
I think that's the name.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.699
-(laughter)
-(doorbell rings)

23:52.732 --> 23:53.866
Oh.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.101
More guests.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.970
-Uh, Bertram. Shall we?
-On my way.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.939
(whispering):
You might have been more
helpful back there.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.941
I don't lie as nimbly as you.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.376
-Hello.
-Joan.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.646
I hope you don't mind me
bringing my Aunt Martha.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.080
Her doctor's appointment
ran late,

24:08.114 --> 24:09.949
and there wasn't time
to get her home first.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.684
I don't have to come in.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.486
I can wait in the car.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.387
JOAN:
Then complain all the way home
I abandoned you?

24:15.421 --> 24:17.456
I'm not falling for that again.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.860
The more the merrier. So...
(chuckles)

24:20.893 --> 24:22.061
Please come in.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.564
This way. Yes. You, too.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.465
Welcome. Welcome.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.701
(both laughing nervously)

24:28.735 --> 24:30.537
Take the old woman
to the dining room.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.071
She's clearly in a foul mood.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.106
I don't want her ruining
my party for the nice ladies.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.875
When do they arrive?

24:39.912 --> 24:41.881
Think, uh,
think that's enough tip?

24:41.914 --> 24:44.116
Sure.
I'll take it over to Judy.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.985
We need to hurry if we're
going to make that movie.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.556
All right. (grunts)

24:52.759 --> 24:54.961
*

25:00.800 --> 25:02.669
Sid Hemple.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.936
What're you doing here?

25:03.970 --> 25:06.072
What do you think, Mr. Loomis?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.574
I think you're following me.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.041
Doesn't feel good, does it?

25:09.075 --> 25:11.043
Knowing you're being watched.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.984
Is there another way
out of this place?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.786
Through the kitchen. Why?

25:19.819 --> 25:22.121
We got a situation.
There's no time to explain.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.724
Okay. Follow me.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.536
Vern, who is that creep?

25:37.570 --> 25:38.838
The husband of
one of my clients.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.372
-He looks angry.
-Yeah, well,

25:40.406 --> 25:41.841
I know what she'll
be getting in alimony.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.810
Trust me, he's furious.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.111
Where do you think
you're going, Loomis?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.846
Look, just calm down, Sid.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.715
All right?
We-we don't want any trouble.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.883
That's too bad
because you got it.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.018
In buckets.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.452
Dee.

25:53.485 --> 25:54.754
-Go back into the diner.
-The hell I will.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.855
VERN:
Do what I'm telling you!

25:55.888 --> 25:57.023
Vern!

25:57.990 --> 26:00.059
(grunting)

26:02.094 --> 26:03.329
DEE:
Hey!

26:03.362 --> 26:05.031
Don't you touch him!

26:05.998 --> 26:08.467
(groaning, grunting)

26:13.505 --> 26:14.573
-Ah!
-OFFICER: Hey!

26:14.607 --> 26:15.608
What are you doing?

26:15.642 --> 26:18.444
Help! This man just attacked us!

26:18.477 --> 26:19.846
Stop!

26:19.879 --> 26:21.914
Vern, did he cut you?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.449
Your leg. How bad is it?

26:23.482 --> 26:24.784
-Let me see.
-Okay. I'm fine.

26:26.552 --> 26:27.987
I said I was fine.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.063
Oh. You're kind
to look after me.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.098
And I'm sorry
I spoiled your party.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.967
Oh, it's not my party.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.434
I'm delighted you're here.

26:43.535 --> 26:44.937
Well, you're the only one.

26:44.971 --> 26:48.841
I don't fit in
with my niece's fancy friends.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.076
Well, do you want to
know a secret?

26:50.109 --> 26:51.343
Neither do I.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.578
(chuckles)

26:52.611 --> 26:54.046
And I'm not sure
my wife does either.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.015
-Refills.
-MARTHA: Oh.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.851
-Martha? Are you all right?
-Uh...

26:58.885 --> 27:00.987
Never get old, Bertram.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.422
Oh, you lose so much.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.859
Your home, your freedom,
your health.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.394
Your health?

27:08.427 --> 27:09.762
Are you ill?

27:09.796 --> 27:11.998
I'm falling apart.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.967
Oh, but you don't want to hear
how sick I am.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.804
Oh, but I do.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.739
I really do.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.007
ALMA:
Does anyone else need wine?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.909
Well, I could
certainly use some.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.677
The week I have had.

27:24.711 --> 27:28.347
Well, first, my sister dumps
Aunt Martha on my doorstep.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.683
Then I met my 24-year-old son's

27:30.717 --> 27:33.052
new girlfriend, Myra.

27:33.085 --> 27:36.588
Chip is dating a twice-divorced
fry cook and--

27:36.622 --> 27:39.959
get this-- she's 36.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.828
-No.
-Yes, so...

27:41.861 --> 27:44.063
So, pour like
there's no tomorrow.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.032
Thirty-six?

27:46.065 --> 27:48.100
(chuckles) That's what?

27:48.134 --> 27:49.101
12 years older?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.436
I know.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.538
He is tossing his life away.

27:52.571 --> 27:54.406
No, no, no.
What I'm saying is,

27:54.440 --> 27:57.309
it's not that much
of an age difference.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.781
Right?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.384
Grace, you're out of tea.
I'll make some more.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.652
JOAN:
Maybe I didn't make this clear.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.121
Chip wants to marry Myra.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.090
-(all gasping)
-Ah. I mean,

28:11.123 --> 28:12.792
how can I get grandchildren
when this dame

28:12.825 --> 28:14.360
is five minutes
away from menopause?

28:14.393 --> 28:15.928
I hate cradle robbers.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.530
MAVIS:
Oh. You just want
to shake them and say,

28:18.564 --> 28:20.867
"Honey, that kid on your arm
who makes you feel so young,

28:20.900 --> 28:23.069
is making you look really old."

28:23.102 --> 28:24.871
-GRACE: It's so sad.
-JOAN: It's sad.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.072
-MAVIS: Yes, it is sad.
-JOAN: It's sad.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.040
Excuse me.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.345
-Do you need more wine?
-Actually,

28:33.379 --> 28:35.347
I was wondering
if you had anything stronger.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.016
Oh, you mean like spirits?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.851
Yes.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.086
(chuckling):
Of course.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.520
(clears throat)

28:42.588 --> 28:43.856
Is everything all right?

28:43.890 --> 28:47.393
-Oh, I'm just having a bad day.
-Oh.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.762
Oh. Rye whiskey?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.097
Oh...

28:51.130 --> 28:53.432
Well, I guess beggars
can't be choosers.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.101
(Alma chuckles nervously)

28:55.134 --> 28:58.037
It's hard for me to imagine
Rita Castillo having a bad day.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.472
Why? Because I'm rich?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.574
Because you're so beautiful.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.744
-(gasps) Ooh. That hurt.
-Oh.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.479
Do you have any ginger ale?

29:07.513 --> 29:10.516
Yes. (clears throat)

29:12.118 --> 29:14.086
You probably
take your looks for granted.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.555
But believe me,

29:16.588 --> 29:18.390
you're breathtaking.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.959
(laughs)

29:19.992 --> 29:21.660
Well, I used to be.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.796
Beauty like yours doesn't fade.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.765
You'll be stunning
until your dying day.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.836
You don't know what I would
give to look in the mirror,

29:29.869 --> 29:33.105
just once, and see a face
like yours gazing back at me.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.075
Why, even standing here now,

29:36.108 --> 29:37.709
talking to you
like we're two old friends,

29:37.743 --> 29:39.111
I...

29:39.145 --> 29:40.679
I feel like I've
won the lottery.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.815
I'm babbling, aren't I?

29:42.849 --> 29:44.817
I always seem
to do that with you.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.552
(chuckles)

29:46.585 --> 29:48.520
What you must think of me.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.759
I think you're a very nice lady.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.094
(laughs)

29:55.127 --> 29:57.864
Probably too nice for this club.

29:57.897 --> 30:01.433
Though you do seem to have
a few tricks up your sleeve.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.669
How do you mean?

30:03.702 --> 30:07.573
Alma, if you've been to Paris,

30:07.606 --> 30:09.708
I've been to the moon.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.544
I'm so embarrassed about that.

30:12.578 --> 30:15.081
I-I do, I know better
than to put on airs.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.083
Oh, you weren't putting on airs.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.085
You were putting on armor.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.420
-Armor?
-Mm-hmm.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.489
Like that dress.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.791
Now, come on. That's never been
in your closet.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.760
No. You're right. I, um...

30:28.794 --> 30:29.996
borrowed it.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.364
Well, good for you.

30:32.398 --> 30:35.401
I admire women
who try to remake themselves.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.669
Reject the hand they were dealt,

30:37.703 --> 30:39.338
become someone new.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.741
Smarter, prettier, stronger.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.844
When women like us
do it well enough,

30:45.878 --> 30:49.515
no one can imagine
we were ever anyone else.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.384
(giggles)

30:53.719 --> 30:55.854
I feel like you have
so much to teach me.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.691
Well, maybe I will.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.827
My time has freed up a bit.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.762
I can use a new project.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.032
That mean you'll let me
be in the club?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.099
Sure.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.968
Under one condition.

31:09.001 --> 31:12.004
You got to start stocking
better booze.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.608
(doorbell rings)

31:19.111 --> 31:20.779
Oh, hey.

31:20.812 --> 31:22.648
I-I really need to see Rita.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.451
She told me you cheated on her
with a fat girl.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.719
She doesn't want
to ever see you again.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.521
I know she's mad.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.090
But I don't got a cent.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.959
And I need a place
to sleep tonight.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.860
Uh, is there any way
you could give me ten bucks?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.862
I-I'm begging.

31:37.796 --> 31:40.332
For God's sake. Wait here.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.533
(sighs)

31:48.040 --> 31:49.441
Do I know you?

31:50.809 --> 31:51.944
Uh...

31:51.978 --> 31:53.479
I don't think so.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.780
I do.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.748
You work for the dry cleaner.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.551
Oh.

32:00.619 --> 32:01.787
Yeah. That's me.

32:01.820 --> 32:05.491
I'm Catherine,
Mr. Castillo's daughter.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.059
Don't move.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.535
I took this
out of my household account.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.504
But I'm on a budget,
so don't ask for more.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.505
How much is it?

32:19.538 --> 32:21.240
Six dollars and 52 cents.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.909
-Well... (scoffs)
-(footsteps approaching)

32:24.943 --> 32:26.845
I'm so glad I caught you.

32:26.878 --> 32:29.381
I don't know if these pants
can be salvaged.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.518
You see, my papa,
he's not well.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.853
So, he has his "accidents."

32:34.886 --> 32:37.956
Just clean them
as best as you can.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.229
Don't you worry, ma'am.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.331
We'll get your father's pants
as good as new.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.268
I forgot.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.438
You still owe me 20,
for those linens last week.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.278
Thanks.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.317
If it's not too forward
of me to say, ma'am,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.953
that scarf looks lovely on you.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.257
Thank you.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.927
What a charming young man.

33:15.961 --> 33:17.496
Hmm.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.533
So, you're sure
that it's cancer?

33:21.567 --> 33:22.568
Yes.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.537
And the pain is intolerable.

33:25.571 --> 33:29.975
But I've gone on
about my suffering long enough.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.877
How bored you must be.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.512
No, it's fine.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.347
In fact, if you
ever want some company...

33:35.381 --> 33:36.915
(gasps)

33:36.948 --> 33:40.486
You would come visit
an old windbag like me?

33:40.519 --> 33:44.456
Oh. What a dear man you are.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.791
(both chuckling)

33:47.493 --> 33:49.861
-(laughter)
-And then, after all that,

33:49.895 --> 33:51.597
I had to put up
all the ornaments myself.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.199
(laughter)

33:54.566 --> 33:56.468
Why didn't
your husband help you?

33:56.502 --> 33:58.570
Oh, don't get me started
on my husband.

33:58.604 --> 33:59.938
RITA:
Oh, Joan.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.141
No one has to get you started.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.909
You're self-winding.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.477
(laughter)

34:05.511 --> 34:06.912
Is that your way of saying

34:06.945 --> 34:08.013
I've been dominating
the conversation?

34:09.081 --> 34:10.382
(laughter)

34:10.416 --> 34:11.583
Fine.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.519
Alma, the powder room is...?

34:13.552 --> 34:16.522
-Just down the hall.
-Thank you.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.960
(scoffs) Honestly?

34:21.993 --> 34:25.063
A ten-minute story about
hanging Christmas decorations?

34:25.097 --> 34:26.098
Don't be mean, Rita.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.567
I-I adore Joan. I do.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.503
It's just,
she's such a damn chatterbox.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.139
(chuckles)

34:33.172 --> 34:35.407
Don't you agree, Alma?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.110
ALMA:
Oh, um...

34:39.145 --> 34:42.948
Well, I-I-I could listen to
Joan talk about herself all day.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.552
And...

34:46.585 --> 34:49.888
if I get into the club,
I suppose I will.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.823
(laughter)

34:55.927 --> 34:59.565
You said your wife didn't fit in
with my niece's friends.

34:59.598 --> 35:03.402
Sounds to me,
she's fitting in just fine.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.804
(laughter)

35:05.837 --> 35:07.239
Alma.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.874
Do you have a dog?

35:08.907 --> 35:10.842
We're taking care
of our neighbor's. Why?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.110
You better put it on a leash.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.512
It's in your garden,
digging like mad.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.249
(gasps)

35:22.053 --> 35:24.122
(growling)

35:34.900 --> 35:37.035
-(growling)
-What are we going to do?

35:37.068 --> 35:39.371
(panting):
Tie up the dog.

35:39.405 --> 35:42.274
Get a shovel and some fertilizer
from the toolshed.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.875
Cover the body.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.344
I'll keep the ladies inside
until you're done.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.012
JOAN:
Come, Aunt Martha.
It's time to go.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.848
And hurry.

35:52.117 --> 35:53.485
Alma, there you are.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.521
We were just saying
our goodbyes.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.989
You're leaving? So soon?

35:58.023 --> 35:59.258
Well, you've been very gracious,

35:59.291 --> 36:00.526
but we don't want
to overstay our welcome.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.560
No. You can't leave.

36:01.593 --> 36:04.463
Oh. Why?

36:05.464 --> 36:06.798
It's not safe.

36:09.335 --> 36:12.003
We're-we're looking after
our-our neighbor's dog.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.405
Vicious little beast,

36:13.439 --> 36:15.006
it's already bitten
several people this week.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.008
We had him tied up out back,
but he got loose.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.544
Bertram is subduing him.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.912
But while he does,
let's just stay safe and sound.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.416
It's been too nice a party to
end in shrieks and ankle bites.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.252
Just how dangerous is he?

36:26.285 --> 36:29.120
Ah, you know what would help
pass the time is music.

36:29.154 --> 36:32.358
(chuckles) Mavis, I know that
your manicurist will scold you,

36:32.391 --> 36:34.293
but would you play something
for us?

36:34.326 --> 36:35.794
-Play? Sure.
-Oh.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.431
-You know, I sing as well.
-Oh.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.199
As well as who?

36:41.233 --> 36:44.002
Oh, Rita.
I'm sure she sings marvelously.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.404
Ladies, gather round now.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.073
Mavis is going to dazzle us.
All right.

36:48.106 --> 36:51.977
Now, this is a little something
I used to sing in college.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.546
(plays ascending scale)

36:55.914 --> 36:58.016
* In olden days
a glimpse of stocking *

36:58.049 --> 37:00.151
* Was looked on
as something shocking *

37:00.185 --> 37:01.487
* Now heaven knows *

37:01.520 --> 37:02.954
Everybody sing.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.524
ALL:
* Anything goes... *

37:05.557 --> 37:08.494
Rocco. Rocco!

37:08.527 --> 37:10.228
Come here!

37:10.262 --> 37:12.931
* Writing prose... *

37:12.964 --> 37:15.000
-(barking)
-What are you doing? No.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.202
* The world has gone mad today *

37:17.235 --> 37:19.037
* And good's bad today *

37:19.070 --> 37:20.171
* And black's white today *

37:20.205 --> 37:21.273
* And day's night today *

37:21.307 --> 37:22.474
* When most guys today *

37:22.508 --> 37:24.109
* That women prize today *

37:24.142 --> 37:25.944
* Are just silly gigolos *

37:25.977 --> 37:28.046
* So though I'm not
a great romancer... *

37:28.079 --> 37:30.215
-(barking)
-Oh, shush!

37:30.248 --> 37:32.918
* When I propose *

37:32.951 --> 37:36.187
* Anything goes *

37:36.221 --> 37:38.457
* Anything
goes *

37:38.490 --> 37:41.427
* Anything goes. *

37:44.630 --> 37:46.131
So how's he doing?

37:46.164 --> 37:47.566
He refuses
to go to the hospital.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.200
Vern.

37:49.234 --> 37:51.303
I'm fine.
I just needed a few stitches.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.871
I need you
to stay put for a sec.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.540
You still
got to sign a release form.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.208
(indistinct chatter)

37:59.378 --> 38:01.079
So...

38:01.112 --> 38:02.881
Why didn't you tell me
about your leg?

38:02.914 --> 38:05.484
You mean the one that looks like
a charred piece of barbecue?

38:05.517 --> 38:07.819
Golly. I'm not sure.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.922
Is that why
your girl dumped you?

38:12.591 --> 38:15.026
I wrote her from a hospital bed
in France,

38:15.060 --> 38:17.396
and I told her
I got hurt real bad.

38:17.429 --> 38:21.333
She wrote back saying
I served my country,

38:21.367 --> 38:23.335
and she was proud of me.

38:23.369 --> 38:25.471
That it didn't matter to her.

38:27.839 --> 38:31.076
But when I got back home
and she saw...

38:33.912 --> 38:36.181
The look on her face was...

38:37.215 --> 38:38.384
She didn't handle it well?

38:38.417 --> 38:40.118
No.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.788
She broke up with me
a week later.

38:43.555 --> 38:46.324
That's why you haven't dated
anyone else?

38:46.358 --> 38:48.159
You just gave up on love?

38:48.193 --> 38:51.930
I couldn't stand to see that
look on another woman's face.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.132
Besides, there's...

38:54.165 --> 38:56.402
there's worse things
than being alone.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.836
Hey.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.306
I'm right here,

39:01.339 --> 39:03.509
and I'm not going anywhere.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.212
ROHBIN:
Now, what is going on here?

39:07.245 --> 39:08.880
Rohbin.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.082
You know, I thought I smelled
cheap cologne.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.518
(chuckles)

39:12.551 --> 39:14.853
That's Detective Rohbin
to you now, Loomis.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.288
Mike and I,
we used to work together

39:17.322 --> 39:18.457
back when I was on the force.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.859
This here is Dee Fillcot.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.127
Is this guy bothering you,
ma'am?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.261
Because I can arrest him
right now.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.864
No. You don't need to do that.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.265
See...

39:27.298 --> 39:28.967
I'm his girl.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.236
Is that so?

39:35.073 --> 39:36.575
Yeah.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.944
She's my girl.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.548
(laughing)

39:42.581 --> 39:44.249
ALMA:
It was lovely having you.

39:44.282 --> 39:46.084
I think we should sing
at every party, don't you?

39:46.117 --> 39:49.287
-(laughter)
-Oh, my goodness.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.523
(sighs) Thanks again, Alma.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.291
I can't remember when
I've had a better time.

39:53.324 --> 39:54.960
It was truly my pleasure.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.394
I do hope I'll see you all
again soon.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.130
I'm absolutely sure you will.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.470
(both giggling)

40:06.404 --> 40:08.139
Bye.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.483
ALMA:
Oh, Bertie.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.485
It was a triumph.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.953
The last thing Rita
said to me was...

40:21.987 --> 40:23.154
What're you doing?

40:24.322 --> 40:26.357
The party's over.

40:26.391 --> 40:29.227
The sooner we return
Mrs. Yost's things, the better.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.262
I'm not sure I agree.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.297
What?

40:32.330 --> 40:33.999
We can't keep these things.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.366
Well...

40:35.400 --> 40:37.536
It's not as if Mrs. Yost
is going to miss them.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.838
And today was such a success.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.073
If, by some miracle, I...

40:42.107 --> 40:43.341
I do get into the club,

40:43.374 --> 40:45.076
I'll be expected
to host the ladies again.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.878
How will I explain
the disappearance

40:46.912 --> 40:48.547
of all of our nicest things?

40:48.580 --> 40:50.081
You'll make something up.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.783
Apparently,
you're quite good at that.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.085
I don't like your tone.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.487
I don't like yours.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.055
I want our things back.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.990
I liked my home the way it was.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.892
I like you the way you were.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.127
I love the woman
in this photograph.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.795
Well, I don't!

41:05.330 --> 41:06.898
In fact, I hate her.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.501
She wanted so much out of life.

41:09.535 --> 41:12.504
Others convinced her
that she wasn't worthy.

41:12.538 --> 41:15.306
So, she told herself
to be happy with the scraps

41:15.340 --> 41:16.575
that were thrown her way.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.777
She gobbled them up
with gratitude.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.479
One day, she realized that...

41:22.480 --> 41:24.115
...she deserved more.

41:24.149 --> 41:27.252
That's what Dee and I
are to you, is it? Scraps?

41:27.285 --> 41:29.187
Of course not.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.490
My family is my heart.

41:32.524 --> 41:36.562
And I have been happy
within these four walls.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.497
But there's a big,
beautiful world out there

41:39.531 --> 41:41.199
I've never been a part of.

41:42.568 --> 41:45.136
The women in-in
this Garden Club,

41:45.170 --> 41:47.839
they can be my tour guides.

41:47.873 --> 41:51.176
They can introduce me
to everything life has to offer.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.181
Bertie...

41:57.348 --> 41:59.851
Help me be the woman
I want to be.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.421
Let's bury the old Alma.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.829
Whatever you want, my love.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.002
I know some of the girls
want to nominate Ada Coy

42:17.035 --> 42:20.071
for the new spot, but I think
we have to consider Alma.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.273
Mm. She'd be an unusual choice.

42:22.307 --> 42:23.575
But I really like her.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.143
Me, too.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.078
Rita, what do you think?

42:30.515 --> 42:32.550
I think Alma is absolutely

42:32.584 --> 42:34.419
Elysian Park Garden Club
material.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.221
Lovely.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.990
I will schedule a vote
with the whole club.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.459
Um, I'll call Sue,
and I'll make sure that...

42:41.492 --> 42:43.361
Well, we could have it
at my house.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.296
NARRATOR:
As Rita watched
the Fillcots kiss,

42:45.330 --> 42:47.933
she had the strangest sensation.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.335
She actually envied Alma.

42:50.368 --> 42:52.503
For her happy marriage,

42:52.537 --> 42:56.207
her crooked little home,
and her simple little life.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.977
And for a moment,

42:59.010 --> 43:01.980
she wondered if maybe Alma
had something to teach her

43:02.013 --> 43:04.249
about attaining true happiness.

43:04.282 --> 43:07.118
But that thought vanished
with the arrival

43:07.152 --> 43:09.154
of an oddly familiar face.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.492
*

43:18.029 --> 43:20.431
When Rita realized
who this girl was,

43:20.465 --> 43:22.901
her envy was washed away,

43:22.934 --> 43:26.271
and replaced with an emotion

43:26.304 --> 43:29.140
far more insidious.
