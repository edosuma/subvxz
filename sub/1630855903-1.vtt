This is not a toy.

You're wanted in two counties.

[Patt] You're gettin' pretty
famous now.

01:12.527 --> 01:13.748

This guy Murphy--
he owns a big store in Lincoln.

01:17.905 --> 01:19.182
[Baker] They got a company
called The House,

01:19.245 --> 01:20.872
and they run it outta
Murphy's store.

Well, Billy, I want to say
it's a great honor

01:22.413 --> 01:24.571

in the flesh. Great honor.

You have a contract with us.

[George] I'm talkin' about

-[George] Murphy's got the loudest pocket.

01:57.627 --> 01:59.555
Billy, these people,
they don't mean anything.

01:59.649 --> 02:01.625
[Billy] I agree to meet
with Tunstall.

02:01.728 --> 02:02.991
It has to be in secret.

[McSween] This is the time and place

Major Murphy's payroll.

[Tunstall] Gentlemen, I believe
we all know why we're here.

05:01.639 --> 05:04.825
There is no hiding the fact
that we are now effectively

05:05.609 --> 05:08.226
at war with Mr. Murphy
and the House.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.094
I hear Murphy's
hiring more guns.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.822
[Tunstall] I know,
but I've been recruiting, too.

05:12.905 --> 05:14.935
I think you gentlemen have
already made the acquaintance

05:15.038 --> 05:17.411
of Fred Waite
and John Middleton.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.191
Yeah. We mostly
all know each other.

05:19.305 --> 05:21.505
[Tunstall] And most of you
will also know Juan Patrón,

05:21.598 --> 05:23.789
as a leading member
of the Hispanic community.

05:23.862 --> 05:26.775
He's very important because he
can persuade that community

05:26.838 --> 05:29.271
to trust and support us.

05:29.405 --> 05:30.703
Now, I promise you

05:31.836 --> 05:35.501
the last thing I want
is a shooting match.

05:35.584 --> 05:38.762
But if it comes to it,
we have to be ready.

05:38.986 --> 05:41.280
I want you all to know
that I'm appointing Billy

05:41.353 --> 05:42.727
as my second-in-command.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.776
So, if I'm not around, you'll
take your orders from him.

05:49.225 --> 05:51.803
I thank you for your gesture,
Mr. Tunstall.

05:55.497 --> 05:57.632
But I think you should give
the job to Dick Brewer.

05:59.485 --> 06:03.747
Of course. If that is your wish,
Billy, I concur.

06:04.061 --> 06:07.435
So, let's be clear
about the way forward.

06:07.558 --> 06:11.563
I will not be intimidated
by Murphy and his crooks.

06:12.376 --> 06:16.885
On the contrary, I intend
to pursue my business freely--

06:17.119 --> 06:18.528
expanding my store,

06:18.631 --> 06:21.893
my cattle stock,
and even opening a new bank--

06:21.957 --> 06:24.234
a bank that will offer
the people of Lincoln

06:24.298 --> 06:26.168
easy credit
and a way of escaping

06:26.251 --> 06:28.922
-the House's corrupt business practices.
-[clears throat]

06:29.566 --> 06:32.484
I don't want to be the fly
in the ointment, Mr. Tunstall.

06:32.597 --> 06:35.687
But I must remind the meeting that Murphy
still has powerful friends.

06:35.811 --> 06:37.482
We're not just taking on
the House here.

06:37.575 --> 06:39.470
We're also taking on
the Santa Fe Ring,

06:39.614 --> 06:41.805
and that is a different
proposition altogether.

06:49.301 --> 06:51.911
You know, I really did
appreciate the offer, Mr. Tunstall.

06:53.034 --> 06:55.355
But Brewer's been here longer.

06:56.339 --> 06:58.303
He knows your operation,
and the men trust him.

06:58.816 --> 07:01.530
[horse whinnies]

07:01.983 --> 07:05.205
Well, if he has your support,
he'll certainly have mine.

[indistinct chatter]

07:23.419 --> 07:24.461
[Murphy] You know, boys...

07:26.252 --> 07:29.584

went too far,

07:30.727 --> 07:34.094
killing those farmers,
even their children.

07:34.807 --> 07:37.648
Dragging my name and my business
through the mud, eh?

07:38.422 --> 07:40.515
Tunstall is trying to break us.

Shit.

07:44.658 --> 07:45.963

07:47.287 --> 07:48.646
I can ruin Tunstall
just like that.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.807
[snaps fingers]

07:49.900 --> 07:52.201
Same way I ruined anybody else
who tried to muscle in on my business.

07:52.304 --> 07:54.127
[Dolan] It's no longer
your business.

07:54.751 --> 07:58.113
We bought you out, remember?
And right now, our business

07:58.186 --> 08:00.143
is staring bankruptcy
right in the face.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.400
[Riley] We're not just dealing
with Tunstall and a few local farmers.

08:04.783 --> 08:07.106
He has Billy the Kid
working for him.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.297
So? You don't get it.
I don't want a war.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.525
You don't have a choice.
We have information that

08:14.599 --> 08:16.332
Tunstall wants to open up
a bank here.

08:16.475 --> 08:19.182
Our biggest lender,
Thomas Catron, who just happens

08:19.256 --> 08:21.345
to be the President
of Catron Bank and Trust,

08:21.448 --> 08:23.213
isn't exactly gonna like that.

08:23.297 --> 08:24.584
[billiard ball clacking]

08:25.188 --> 08:26.680
I know who Catron is.

08:27.403 --> 08:29.478
Need I remind ya's
that Mr. Catron and I

08:29.541 --> 08:31.719
are old friends and that
we still do business together.

08:32.073 --> 08:34.477
Catron will deal with the bank.

08:34.592 --> 08:36.597
-Even so--
-Jesus!

08:38.738 --> 08:42.592
[Murphy] So, the two of you make me laugh.

08:43.187 --> 08:45.480
You make me fuckin' laugh.

08:46.244 --> 08:47.460
Are you kiddin' me?

that they're going to open up

08:50.072 --> 08:53.569
a bank here in Lincoln? Really?
Who for?

08:54.092 --> 08:57.141
Most of them are Mexicans and piss poor,
for Christ's sakes!

08:57.744 --> 08:59.212
What in the name of God
do they need a bank for?

08:59.305 --> 09:00.581
Will you tell me that, eh?

09:02.414 --> 09:04.957
Keep Jesse Evans on a leash.

[Billy] I'm glad you wanted
to ride out with me.

09:22.737 --> 09:26.134
Why did you think I wouldn't?
Because you're an outlaw?

09:26.218 --> 09:28.065
[chuckles] Maybe.

09:28.649 --> 09:29.953
Although I'm not anymore.

09:31.157 --> 09:32.448
Mr. Tunstall saw to that.

09:33.942 --> 09:35.457
I'm so happy to hear that,
Billy.

09:38.319 --> 09:40.282

09:40.376 --> 09:42.075
What about your parents?
Will they be happy?

09:43.039 --> 09:46.277
My family still has
a strong Spanish heritage.

09:47.130 --> 09:48.595
They are tied to the old ways.

09:49.428 --> 09:50.596
And yourself?

09:53.473 --> 09:55.644
I think it's better to adapt
to this new way of life.

We can't change it,

13:19.638 --> 13:23.102
If we're going to war,
what say we raid 'em?

13:23.185 --> 13:24.322
Raid 'em?

13:25.186 --> 13:26.306
Good then.

13:26.869 --> 13:27.903
We're agreed.

13:28.006 --> 13:29.655
But hang fire
for a little while.

13:30.148 --> 13:32.710
We don't want to give Tunstall
any excuses to go to the law.

13:34.183 --> 13:35.334
[sighs]

13:36.641 --> 13:38.446
Then what the fuck
are we doin' here?

13:40.072 --> 13:42.218
Well, what you're doing here,
Mr. Evans...

13:43.431 --> 13:45.368
... is you're gonna keep
an eye on your friend,

13:45.451 --> 13:48.745
Billy the Boy, 'cause
he's a danger to all of us.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.310
[Dolan] Don't you worry,
Mr. Evans.

13:50.954 --> 13:52.175
You'll get your excitement.

13:56.285 --> 13:59.672
[cows mooing]

13:59.835 --> 14:01.505
[Billy] Charlie, you know
this business with the House

14:01.588 --> 14:02.783
might get messy, right?

14:04.187 --> 14:06.855
With your wife carryin' your first child
and all, you got a lot to lose.

14:08.699 --> 14:14.487
[mooing continues]

14:14.556 --> 14:16.016
I can't walk away.

14:19.184 --> 14:20.312
Not now.

14:22.315 --> 14:24.939
[mooing continues]

14:27.383 --> 14:28.435
[grunts]

14:29.058 --> 14:30.233
Come on, girl. Attagirl.

14:30.887 --> 14:32.194
-[Billy] Come on.
-[mooing]

14:32.278 --> 14:33.603
Here, girl. Come on.

14:38.532 --> 14:40.867
[water splashes]

14:47.998 --> 14:49.349
If you get killed...

14:51.709 --> 14:54.627
... what do I tell the child who
will never meet their father?

15:06.151 --> 15:08.392
You look like
a soldier now, Charlie.

15:17.644 --> 15:21.561
[wind whistling]

15:21.689 --> 15:24.384
[insects chirping]

15:24.498 --> 15:28.863
[Tunstall] It's... it's strange, Billy,
but I... I feel like I know you already.

15:29.216 --> 15:30.618
Of course, I don't, really.

15:31.922 --> 15:34.685
-Tell me something about yourself.
-What is there to know?

15:34.808 --> 15:37.435
Well, tell me
about your family.

15:41.884 --> 15:47.203
I had a mother, a father,
little brother Joe.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.374
They all died.

15:56.210 --> 15:57.685
I have three sisters...

15:59.509 --> 16:01.063
back home in England, and...

16:03.386 --> 16:05.513
they all mean the world to me.

16:07.807 --> 16:09.548
My mom was
a very special person.

16:11.601 --> 16:13.498
Saw the world different to most.

16:17.021 --> 16:18.249
Just didn't make it.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.793
I'm sorry.

16:22.706 --> 16:23.923
No need to be sorry.

16:25.656 --> 16:28.376
You've given me a chance
at a life I'd almost stopped believing in.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.438
Well, you must believe in it,
Billy, you must.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.119
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

16:39.558 --> 16:43.335
But I--I know you gave up
a lot to join me.

16:46.178 --> 16:47.319
You had friends?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.512
Jesse, sure.

16:52.436 --> 16:54.184
Jesse and I go a long way back.

16:56.577 --> 16:58.433
He always liked living
outside the law.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.221
I don't.

17:02.464 --> 17:03.556
That's why I'm here.

17:08.143 --> 17:12.479
[indistinct chatter]

17:29.874 --> 17:32.432
[whinnying]

17:37.539 --> 17:40.375
[indistinct chatter]

17:56.803 --> 18:01.208
[indistinct conversations]

18:01.307 --> 18:03.225
-[chuckles]
-[door closes]

18:03.309 --> 18:04.434
[Walz] Gentlemen.

18:07.056 --> 18:08.139
Good evening.

18:08.872 --> 18:10.724
Allow me to introduce myself.

18:12.106 --> 18:13.320
My name is Edgar Walz.

18:13.983 --> 18:16.221
I am the son-in-law
of Mr. Thomas Catron,

18:16.735 --> 18:18.111
as well as his agent.

18:18.195 --> 18:21.072
Now, I presume you are...

18:22.276 --> 18:24.422
Mr. Dolan and Mr. Riley?

18:24.716 --> 18:26.242
Indeed, Mr. Walz.
Johnnie Riley,

18:26.326 --> 18:28.243
and it is our absolute
pleasure to meet you.

18:28.327 --> 18:29.406
And I'm Jim Dolan.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.947
We're glad you could
make it, Mr. Walz.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.830
[Riley] You sit. I'll pour.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.461
By all means.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.669
I think we should drink
to the success of the House, no?

18:39.832 --> 18:41.921
[glasses clink]

18:43.642 --> 18:44.995
Yes. Why not?

18:51.694 --> 18:55.180
I am here on important business
on behalf of Mr. Catron.

18:55.623 --> 18:58.596
Mr. Catron is deeply concerned

18:59.060 --> 19:02.310
about the current financial
position of the House,

19:02.393 --> 19:07.184
and he's actually wondering who
the hell is running this show?

19:07.648 --> 19:09.649
Because he knows that
Mr. Murphy is somewhat...

19:09.732 --> 19:11.543
-[sighing]
-... incapacitated.

19:12.526 --> 19:17.192
But to be honest, he expected
more from you two jokers.

19:18.906 --> 19:21.216
That seems a little bit unfair,
doesn't it, Mr. Walz?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.519
It's business, Mr. Dolan.

19:25.953 --> 19:27.024
It's business.

19:28.747 --> 19:30.705
[Riley] We share
Mr. Catron's concerns.

19:31.549 --> 19:33.006
We know that the House
is losing money,

19:33.080 --> 19:34.449
and we know
the Englishman Tunstall

19:34.532 --> 19:36.039
is comin' to some
of our markets.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.186
He's also opened a bank.

19:40.630 --> 19:43.758
A fucking bank,
right under your noses.

19:43.841 --> 19:46.650
Now, that is totally
unacceptable to Mr. Catron.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.680
And if you two don't
do something

19:50.763 --> 19:52.821
about closing that bank,
and stop this Englishman

19:52.914 --> 19:54.128
from running his store...

19:55.642 --> 19:57.219
Mr. Catron has no other option

19:58.383 --> 20:02.144
than to remove you two gentlemen
from the equation.

20:05.087 --> 20:06.191
You got that?

20:08.693 --> 20:09.868
Wonderful.

20:11.661 --> 20:15.431
I wish you two
a very pleasant evening.

20:20.868 --> 20:26.134
[indistinct chatter]

20:26.290 --> 20:28.582
-[billiard balls clacking]
-Shot.

20:28.666 --> 20:29.875
He got lucky.

20:30.639 --> 20:31.741
[scoffs]

20:33.385 --> 20:35.462
We've got something
to say to you.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.423
Yeah?

20:40.581 --> 20:41.583
[Riley] Yeah.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.955
We've decided that
it's time to take over

20:46.038 --> 20:49.043
runnin' the business ourselves
entirely.

20:49.556 --> 20:51.391
[Dolan] You see,
when we acquired the House,

20:51.474 --> 20:53.268
you told us
you were planning to retire

20:53.350 --> 20:55.297
and live a nice,
comfortable life in Santa Fe.

20:55.411 --> 20:58.313
[exhaling]

20:58.396 --> 20:59.647
Did I say that?

20:59.731 --> 21:00.815
[Dolan] Aye.

21:01.638 --> 21:02.804
[Murphy] Yeah.

21:04.657 --> 21:06.259
Well, I ain't ready to retire.

21:10.697 --> 21:12.128
We think you ought to.

21:18.239 --> 21:20.981
Well, then, that's your mistake.
Isn't it?

21:25.468 --> 21:26.625
[sucking teeth]

21:26.709 --> 21:28.245
Let's get on
with the game, shall we?

21:33.237 --> 21:36.786
No. We're gettin' tired of this,
and it's got to end.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.024
[sighs]

21:38.718 --> 21:42.390
See, Lawrence, we're not
asking ya to retire.

21:44.764 --> 21:45.907
We're telling ya.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.783
You can fuck off if you think I'm gonna
leave my business over to you two.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.895
Pair of fuckin' hustlers.
You don't know jack shit

21:52.978 --> 21:55.905
about runnin' a business,
and you never fuckin' will.

21:56.018 --> 21:59.554
And you are a useless
and pathetic drunk.

21:59.608 --> 22:02.305
You're an embarrassment to
yourself and to this business.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.154
And you're fuckin'
nothin' without me.

22:05.237 --> 22:07.113
Fuckin' nothin'.

22:13.940 --> 22:15.265
[gun cocks]

22:19.998 --> 22:21.025
Go on.

22:21.659 --> 22:22.855
Pull the trigger.

22:28.463 --> 22:30.756
[gunshot, body thuds]

22:32.099 --> 22:34.092
You better play bold, Murphy.

22:34.175 --> 22:35.721
Things have changed.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.546
You never know
who could be next.

22:45.392 --> 22:48.228
[indistinct chatter]

22:56.316 --> 23:01.362
[indistinct chatter]

23:04.239 --> 23:05.930
It's good to have
you all here with us.

23:07.033 --> 23:10.077
It's particularly gratifying
to have Mr. Saturnino Baca here

23:10.160 --> 23:11.661
and his two beautiful daughters.

23:13.387 --> 23:15.580
Saturnino has been
a great supporter of the House

23:15.664 --> 23:17.541
for many years,
and he has brought with him

23:17.624 --> 23:20.960
into the fold many of our
Mexican friends and neighbors.

23:22.373 --> 23:24.007
But one of the reasons
that we did want you

23:24.080 --> 23:27.881
here with us
is to, uh, reassure you

23:27.965 --> 23:29.425
as to the future of the House,

23:29.508 --> 23:32.434
after the tragic demise
of my partner

23:33.237 --> 23:35.658
and our friend Jim Dolan.

23:36.641 --> 23:39.146
Jim was a good man.
He will be missed.

23:40.850 --> 23:44.538
But you may be rest assured that
our business is in good hands.

23:45.812 --> 23:50.244
We have the financial backing
of Mr. Thomas Catron,

23:50.328 --> 23:54.546
who happens to be the single most powerful
individual in New Mexico.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.779
And together,
we will deal with the threat

23:58.863 --> 24:00.531
of the Englishman, Tunstall.

24:00.954 --> 24:05.297
The man will soon be history.
You have my word.

24:05.701 --> 24:09.110
That's why your future
and lives are safe with us.

24:10.663 --> 24:11.925
Enjoy.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.380
Jesse.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.294
I have heard that Tunstall
is going to Las Vegas,

24:18.377 --> 24:20.546
so it might be a good time
for you and some of your boys

24:20.629 --> 24:22.338
to damage his interests.

24:22.422 --> 24:24.466
We run things here, not him.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.467
I know Tunstall keeps
some of his stock

24:26.550 --> 24:30.145
down at Dick Brewer's ranch
down on the Ruidoso.

24:30.928 --> 24:34.264
Then you have my permission
to fuck with his herd.

24:34.387 --> 24:38.601
[indistinct chatter]

24:44.521 --> 24:45.772
Hey.

24:46.336 --> 24:47.562
You all right?

24:48.215 --> 24:49.421
You want to come with me?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.550
Go have some fun?

24:56.746 --> 24:57.979
Come on, then.

25:25.844 --> 25:27.053
You gotta close your eyes.

25:27.136 --> 25:30.555
-Oh. [laughs]
-[laughs]

25:42.577 --> 25:44.920
[footsteps approaching]

25:45.733 --> 25:47.360
-Ana!
-Papa!

25:48.528 --> 25:49.770
[shouts in Spanish]

25:56.644 --> 25:58.505
You violate my daughter, gringo.

25:59.549 --> 26:01.662
-You pay.
-Put that down, old man.

26:01.745 --> 26:03.568
I didn't do anything
to your daughter.

26:03.831 --> 26:05.169
[spits]

26:05.342 --> 26:07.472
[Murphy] Hey.
What the fuck's goin' on here?

26:09.105 --> 26:12.238
Jesse, don't shoot him!

26:13.682 --> 26:15.700
Saturnino, put down the gun.

26:16.214 --> 26:17.560
This is what happens, my friend,

26:17.674 --> 26:20.506
when you employ gangsters,
los criminales.

26:21.260 --> 26:24.992
For your own sake, amigo,
put down the gun.

26:34.732 --> 26:36.549
[Murphy] Now. That's it.

26:37.492 --> 26:38.767
[gunshot]

26:44.326 --> 26:47.992
Don't ever point
your gun at me again, Mexican,

26:48.655 --> 26:49.997
or you're a dead man.

26:50.379 --> 26:55.368
If I want, I'll have my way,
not just with your daughter,

26:55.451 --> 27:00.116
but I'll have my way...
with the whole world.

27:02.029 --> 27:03.243
That's who I am.

27:15.793 --> 27:21.054
I, I just wanted to say
that the recent... suicide

27:21.288 --> 27:24.307
of Jim Dolan seems to me
to be a sure sign

27:24.390 --> 27:27.100
that the House is now
in financial turmoil.

27:27.183 --> 27:29.935
And...
Well, I'll let Mr. McSween

27:30.019 --> 27:32.521
tell you about
our latest legal developments.

27:32.605 --> 27:36.024
The fixing of low prices
for grain and cattle

27:36.107 --> 27:38.444
has reduced many
of the farmers to penury.

27:39.318 --> 27:42.783
On behalf of those farmers,
we are instigating

27:42.877 --> 27:45.042
legal proceedings
against the House.

27:45.405 --> 27:47.292
And thanks to old Judge Wilson,

27:47.616 --> 27:49.263
I've been appointed
Deputy Sheriff,

27:49.617 --> 27:51.262
despite the objections
of Sheriff Brady.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.624
[chuckles]

27:54.746 --> 27:56.670
-[sniffles]
-[dishes clinking]

27:56.743 --> 27:59.109
You know what?
I'm really startin' to believe

27:59.202 --> 28:00.708
that Tunstall can win
this thing.

28:00.791 --> 28:01.959
Me, too.

28:02.043 --> 28:03.392
What say you, Billy?

28:05.503 --> 28:06.739
Honestly?

28:09.252 --> 28:10.466
If it comes to a shooting war,

28:10.549 --> 28:12.110
the other side
has the advantage.

28:12.964 --> 28:14.186
You're farmers.

28:14.799 --> 28:17.274
Jesse Evans and his gang
are all practiced killers.

28:17.818 --> 28:19.347
They got to be thinking
we're easy meat.

28:20.170 --> 28:23.730
That's not exactly what I wanted
to hear comin' from you.

28:23.823 --> 28:27.170
Come on, George, you can't
hide from the truth.

28:28.223 --> 28:29.477
But there's another truth.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.065
Ordinary folk can perform
extraordinary deeds,

28:33.778 --> 28:35.422
especially if they believe
in something,

28:35.776 --> 28:37.076
and I believe in Tunstall.

28:37.569 --> 28:39.111
I believe he's doing
the right thing

28:39.195 --> 28:40.696
fighting Murphy and the Rings.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.750
And I will fight for his cause.

28:44.547 --> 28:47.743
[Tunstall] Uh, Billy,
can I have a word?

28:50.953 --> 28:54.081
There was just, uh,
one other thing I wanted to say.

28:55.334 --> 28:59.001
[clears throat] Jesse Evans
