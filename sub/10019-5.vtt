00:19.000 --> 00:22.001
- We were here first.
- Shut up, Petey.

00:22.137 --> 00:24.025
- You shut up.
- Move it.

00:24.186 --> 00:26.259
- It's my turn.
- Okay, I'll knock.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.931
Al? Are you there?

00:33.789 --> 00:36.473
Gotcha! Okay. All right.

00:36.637 --> 00:41.275
- Here's some for you, you and you.
- Thank you.

00:41.438 --> 00:44.341
- Happy Halloween!
- Happy Halloween!

00:44.512 --> 00:46.073
Treat?

00:46.624 --> 00:51.677
Chocolate bars, mints and kisses.
They'll be in the ER tomorrow.

00:51.810 --> 00:56.284
Beats all the apples and boxed raisins
we got as kids.

00:56.451 --> 01:00.576
- You can take that off now.
- Take what off?

01:00.772 --> 01:02.682
Did you find the 1040s?

01:02.885 --> 01:08.004
They're here somewhere,
but here are the loan papers.

01:09.479 --> 01:13.342
I thought taking out a second
mortgage would be easier.

01:13.512 --> 01:15.520
Only if you've got the money.

01:15.689 --> 01:21.287
I couldn't finish some of it. You need
a degree to figure out our net worth.

01:21.451 --> 01:27.082
- I'll go over it.
- The bank needs it by tomorrow.

01:30.349 --> 01:34.573
I'll work on them tonight.
I've got a break at 10:30.

01:34.734 --> 01:38.477
- Meet me at Magoo's to pick them up.
- Okay.

01:38.671 --> 01:41.519
- Benton hates my guts.
- No, he likes you.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.707
- He's just got difficulty showing it.
- Yeah, right.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.551
He bagged me on my evaluation.
"Technical skills: Fair.

01:49.714 --> 01:52.911
Diagnostic skills: Fair.
Attitude: Needs improvement."

01:53.075 --> 01:56.043
"Intern shows lack of discipline.
Judgment is often suspect.

01:56.181 --> 01:58.570
Fails to complete work
in a timely fashion."

01:58.741 --> 02:01.327
- Wait. You saw this?
- He wrote the same thing on mine.

02:01.526 --> 02:04.374
- He xeroxed it?
- It's a rubber stamp. Jerry!

02:04.567 --> 02:09.041
- Are you a rat?
- Kangaroo. The head's too itchy.

02:09.208 --> 02:10.485
You're kidding?

02:10.648 --> 02:14.839
Abdominal pain in 3.
Gangrenous toe in 2.

02:15.001 --> 02:18.264
Can you send these back
to Medical Records? I'm late.

02:18.426 --> 02:21.940
- I've got the schedule changes.
- I'll check them when I get back.

02:22.108 --> 02:26.037
- You're on the Healthmobile tonight.
- I'll be back in time.

02:26.204 --> 02:29.501
- What is going on?
- Maintenance is doing repairs.

02:29.630 --> 02:32.828
- It's the ghost from the fifth floor.
- Don't talk about him.

02:32.991 --> 02:34.879
- Who?
- The ghost on 5.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.658
- He bit a lab technician.
- Ghosts don't bite.

02:37.856 --> 02:41.338
- He just knocked the wind out of him.
- Sent cold air through him.

02:41.505 --> 02:47.617
- My friend's been shot. He's outside!
- Alert the O.R. And clear Trauma 1.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.177
- Is Susan back from Hawaii today?
- Yeah, tonight around 6:00.

02:53.348 --> 02:57.987
- Orange carnations?
- Yeah. You know, Halloween.

02:58.150 --> 03:00.900
- Orange carnations?
- Yeah.

03:01.030 --> 03:04.163
I've got a pumpkin carver in 5.
Ate too many seeds.

03:04.328 --> 03:07.460
- What are you supposed to be?
- Myself getting ready for work.

03:07.656 --> 03:10.341
- Here.
- Jerry's getting a count for tonight.

03:10.506 --> 03:12.928
Are you going to the party?
Haleh's singing.

03:13.130 --> 03:15.848
I'm a definite "I don't know."

03:16.011 --> 03:19.241
I'm going if I can.
What's wrong with orange carnations?

03:19.404 --> 03:23.147
Nothing, I gave one to
a teacher once. Second grade.

03:24.302 --> 03:27.980
- Get that ultrasound out of here.
- Take this clown with you.

03:28.143 --> 03:31.755
On my count. One, two, three.
Cyanotic. John, intubate.

03:31.888 --> 03:34.409
Pulse 30 over 180.

03:34.577 --> 03:39.215
- Pulse ox is 80.
- Call Maintenance about the lights.

03:39.410 --> 03:41.931
- What is it?
- Possible hemopneumo.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.538
- Now what?
- Chest tube.

03:43.732 --> 03:46.547
- Right again.
- Chest-tube tray. 36 French.

03:48.213 --> 03:49.806
- Bag him.
- Got the O-neg.

03:49.973 --> 03:51.697
- Pump in two.
- He's flatlining.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.448
An amp of epi, two of atropine.
External compressions.

03:54.614 --> 03:56.437
Two more O-neg. We're losing him!

03:56.599 --> 04:00.015
- Who's got the bullet?
- GSW left chest. Carter intubated.

04:00.184 --> 04:03.152
Put in a chest tube. When he flatlined,
we gave him epi and atropine.

04:03.321 --> 04:06.420
- So what now?
- We should crack him?

04:06.554 --> 04:09.457
Yes, before he's even more dead
than he already is.

04:09.659 --> 04:12.475
Okay. Thoracotomy tray. Scalpel.

04:12.636 --> 04:15.287
- The fifth intercostal space, right?
- Right.

04:15.452 --> 04:17.908
- And the left anterolateral incision?
- Do you know what you're doing?

04:18.077 --> 04:21.427
- I'm just confirming...
- Then you don't know. Carter, get in.

04:21.598 --> 04:23.835
Carter, move. Now!

04:27.040 --> 04:31.580
Rib-spreader. Suction.
I'll take the upper lobe.

04:31.745 --> 04:34.463
All right. Cross-clamp the hilum.

04:41.059 --> 04:44.606
- Come on!
- Get it in!

04:46.821 --> 04:48.829
Right there!

04:57.896 --> 05:00.647
Happy Halloween, everybody!

05:57.050 --> 06:00.531
The first thing you do
is calibrate your apparatus.

06:00.698 --> 06:05.369
Collect the data properly,
and use the root mean square to...

06:05.532 --> 06:09.145
- Is this pre-med physics 101?
- For the past 15 minutes.

06:09.309 --> 06:12.343
- Sorry.
- Do you have a lab assignment?

06:12.477 --> 06:16.439
- No.
- Okay, who's working solo?

06:17.183 --> 06:20.796
There's your lab partner. The
relationship we're looking at...

06:20.992 --> 06:24.310
...is conservation of a momentum
in an elastic collision.

06:24.513 --> 06:27.481
The first thing you do is calibrate
your apparatus.

06:27.650 --> 06:29.756
- Hi, I'm William.
- Carol Hathaway.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.640
I was worried I'd be the only one
without a lab partner.

06:32.803 --> 06:35.455
- Did you bring a graphing calculator?
- Graphing calculator?

06:35.621 --> 06:41.024
That's okay, you can borrow mine.
Neat costume.

06:43.047 --> 06:47.620
- The pacemaker's acting up.
- A nurse will be right with you.

06:47.784 --> 06:49.443
I thought Maintenance was done.

06:49.609 --> 06:53.800
Some people say it's the G-H-O-S-T
on the fifth floor.

06:53.962 --> 06:56.264
There's no such thing as ghosts.

06:56.427 --> 07:00.039
- Who put me in the Healthmobile?
- Our very own Anspaugh.

07:00.203 --> 07:02.375
Every freak in the city
is out there.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.264
Half of them are here already.

07:04.429 --> 07:08.008
It's not so bad. I was on it last
Monday, although we did get shot at.

07:08.173 --> 07:12.037
- Oh, man!
- It was no big deal. They missed.

07:12.207 --> 07:15.110
- Carol's not gonna want to go with me.
- It's Anspaugh's baby.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.452
Community access.
It's out of my hands.

07:17.584 --> 07:21.033
- An unconscious lady's coming in.
- I'll take it.

07:21.202 --> 07:24.301
You were due in Anspaugh's office
10 minutes ago.

07:24.498 --> 07:28.525
Ask Jeanie to take the LOL,
and get Doyle to assist.

07:29.652 --> 07:33.330
- Any word from Susan?
- She's not due in until 6:00.

07:34.294 --> 07:35.439
Thanks.

07:35.606 --> 07:38.192
You're getting to be
a big boy, Reggie.

07:38.358 --> 07:44.525
Okay, developmental milestones.
When do we first see a social smile?

07:44.696 --> 07:46.934
Three weeks.

07:47.065 --> 07:49.968
- Dr. Carter?
- It's more like three months.

07:50.138 --> 07:53.008
Right. Using a spoon and fork?

07:55.068 --> 07:57.785
- Seven months.
- Is that correct, Dr. Carter?

07:58.396 --> 08:01.910
- The average is more like 13.
- Don't worry, Dr. Benton.

08:02.077 --> 08:05.461
Dr. Carter's just closer to
his Pedes rotation than you are.

08:05.631 --> 08:09.309
You'll just need to study up a bit,
won't you? Here.

08:09.472 --> 08:12.222
Why don't you hold Reggie?

08:17.506 --> 08:21.249
- Okay, what's the problem, Dr. Carter?
- Stranger anxiety?

08:21.379 --> 08:26.814
- And what would you do?
- Reggie was responding to you, so...

08:30.565 --> 08:33.948
Keeping the baby calm for
the examination is half the battle.

08:34.150 --> 08:38.788
Some doctors have an instinct,
a natural affinity for children.

08:39.784 --> 08:43.528
You might want to
get some props, Dr. Benton.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.770
- Is she the "do not resuscitate"?
- Yeah.

08:49.931 --> 08:52.779
Husband's name is Mitchell.
Sweet old guy. Seems really upset.

08:52.908 --> 08:55.297
- Is he on his way in?
- Yeah.

08:57.293 --> 09:01.964
Found her in bed.
Comatose. End-stage Lou Gehrig's.

09:02.127 --> 09:04.167
Ready? Go!

09:04.367 --> 09:05.960
- P.A. S run these cases?
- Yeah.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.169
- Not at Southside.
- Dr. Greene asked me.

09:08.336 --> 09:12.167
- Pressure's falling. 50 palp.
- Lungs are wet. Respiratory distress.

09:12.338 --> 09:15.852
- I won't intubate. She's a no-coder.
- Pneumonia. Give her antibiotics.

09:16.019 --> 09:17.579
Treat her? She's a veggie.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.693
Pressure's crashing. Now what?

09:19.860 --> 09:22.446
Ten mcg of dopamine,
titrate to a BP of 100.

09:22.612 --> 09:25.428
Put her on BiPAP, 10 over 5
and a gram of ceftriaxone.

09:25.557 --> 09:26.899
Why are you doing this?

09:27.061 --> 09:29.713
Do not resuscitate
doesn't mean do not treat.

09:29.910 --> 09:32.115
You're the P.A.

09:32.887 --> 09:38.071
- Shouldn't it have epaulets?
- No, those are the dress uniforms.

09:38.233 --> 09:42.424
- Mark! Come on in. A cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

09:42.586 --> 09:46.035
We were celebrating the stamp
of approval on her research study.

09:46.203 --> 09:50.296
It's quite simple. Free-radical
scavengers prevent celluloid damage.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.184
Why not study their effect on asthma?

09:52.349 --> 09:54.870
It occurred to me while treating
a patient in the ER.

09:55.038 --> 09:57.144
Nothing like research
from the trenches.

09:57.279 --> 10:01.623
- The grant shouldn't take long.
- I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

10:01.824 --> 10:05.141
That's me. Gotta go.
I'll see you all at the party tonight?

10:05.345 --> 10:09.918
Wouldn't miss it. Good decision,
bringing Kerry in as an Attending.

10:10.082 --> 10:12.155
Her research ideas are inspired.

10:12.323 --> 10:14.560
I don't need to tell you
that her study...

10:14.723 --> 10:16.829
...will give her a leg up
on that tenure track.

10:16.996 --> 10:20.030
Not that you necessarily want to
stay here at County.

10:20.197 --> 10:23.264
I do.
Of course I'm interested in tenure.

10:23.430 --> 10:27.293
My research would be "Fluid
Resuscitation in Penetrating Trauma."

10:27.431 --> 10:30.596
A lot of Attendings
are pursuing that one.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.216
One that Kerry discarded
is quite interesting.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.516
Have you thought about "The
Microbiology of Abscess Flora"?

10:36.713 --> 10:38.787
- Pus?
- You don't have to commit right now.

10:38.986 --> 10:43.210
Just explore it and get back to me.
End of the week should be fine.

10:44.748 --> 10:48.164
- It's not working.
- Your variable air source is not on.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.406
My air source?

10:50.574 --> 10:53.891
You've never taken physics before,
have you?

10:54.063 --> 10:55.852
- You have?
- Just Introductory.

10:56.015 --> 10:59.332
- There's no AP physics at Jefferson.
- Jefferson High School?

10:59.472 --> 11:03.368
Yeah. I want to be a doctor
or a mechanical engineer.

11:03.538 --> 11:08.144
- What about you?
- I'm not sure what I want to do.

11:09.011 --> 11:13.136
My mom got her real-estate license at
40. I helped her with her homework.

11:13.300 --> 11:17.938
- I can help you with yours.
- Sure. Thanks.

11:21.334 --> 11:24.018
Tina Hargrove, 8. Hit-and-run.
Was trick-or-treating with dad.

11:24.183 --> 11:28.014
Loss of consciousness. GCS, 13.
BP, 130 over 80.

11:28.185 --> 11:30.160
Facial lacs. Trauma to the abdomen.

11:30.329 --> 11:33.428
- It hurts.
- Dad's on the way. He got hit too.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.246
- Double trauma. Clear the room.
- Suture Room.

11:36.411 --> 11:38.932
Call Radiology.
Get a head CT and a C-spine.

11:39.131 --> 11:41.499
All right, on my count.
Nice and gentle. Here we go.

11:41.693 --> 11:45.010
One, two, three. CBC,
type and cross-match five units.

11:45.213 --> 11:47.669
- Radiology is coming down.
- Abdomen is rigid.

11:47.838 --> 11:50.621
- The best incision for an ex-lap?
- Midline.

11:50.783 --> 11:54.461
- Please, it hurts.
- BP's holding steady, 130 over 80.

11:54.624 --> 11:57.145
Which organs are damaged
in blunt abdominal trauma?

11:57.313 --> 11:59.419
- Spleen and liver.
- My stomach still hurts.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.212
Where's my daddy?

12:01.378 --> 12:03.418
- Clear breath sounds.
- Hold her hand, Carter.

12:03.555 --> 12:06.239
- What?
- Hold her hand. Stranger anxiety.

12:06.404 --> 12:08.444
Calm her down.
Check her reflexes.

12:08.612 --> 12:12.323
Hi, Tina. I'm Dr. Carter. Don't be
scared, we'll take care of you.

12:12.485 --> 12:15.333
- Tendon reflexes, two plus and equal.
- Thank you, Dr. Gant.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.730
- Where the hell is Radiology?
- I'll call them.

12:17.894 --> 12:19.782
- High dose epi.
- No pulse, no resps.

12:19.944 --> 12:22.399
- How long has he been down?
- Almost half an hour.

12:22.568 --> 12:25.024
- Is that her daughter next door?
- Tina, 8 years old.

12:25.193 --> 12:26.819
Abdomen's distended.
Probably bled out.

12:26.985 --> 12:32.169
- Let's give him a few more minutes.
- All right. I'll check on the girl.

12:33.483 --> 12:36.386
What causes left shoulder pain
in blunt abdominal trauma?

12:36.524 --> 12:38.859
- Blood irritating the diaphragm.
- How is she doing?

12:39.021 --> 12:42.055
She's stabilizing. We need to hang
500 of Ancef and get her up to CT.

12:42.253 --> 12:45.254
Such enthusiasm. Run up
and tell them what she needs.

12:46.671 --> 12:48.908
- Now?
- Lf you're confident, you know.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.658
Labs are back on Mrs. Jennings.
Not good.

12:59.827 --> 13:02.283
- What do you mean?
- She tested positive for tricyclics.

13:02.452 --> 13:04.460
- What's her level?
- 800.

13:04.628 --> 13:06.516
Suicide. She took the whole bottle.

13:06.645 --> 13:08.140
- Is her husband here?
- Not yet.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.677
Give me an NG
and 50 grams of activated charcoal.

13:10.838 --> 13:13.294
- Why? She's a no-code.
- She tried to kill herself.

13:13.463 --> 13:15.700
- She's a fatal disease.
- We resuscitate suicides.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.165
- She wanted to die.
- All suicides.

13:18.328 --> 13:20.980
Add an amp of bicarb to her IV.

13:22.297 --> 13:25.495
- So you dressed up like a cat?
- My dad made the costume.

13:26.074 --> 13:28.693
- Is he okay?
- I'll check for you.

13:28.859 --> 13:30.899
Did you get
a lot of trick-or-treating stuff?

13:31.067 --> 13:34.516
My dad's got it
so I won't eat it all at once.

13:34.685 --> 13:37.239
Ruptured spleen. Could have injured
a kidney and bladder too.

13:37.405 --> 13:40.024
We'll get a CT and explore her
up in the O.R.

13:40.159 --> 13:41.621
Mark.

13:43.936 --> 13:47.232
- Carter, got a minute?
- Yeah.

13:47.425 --> 13:48.734
Can't you stay?

13:48.897 --> 13:51.232
They'll take pictures
of your head and tummy.

13:51.393 --> 13:53.761
- Then I'll be right there. Okay?
- Tell Dad where I am.

13:53.955 --> 13:55.417
Okay.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.315
Is this the father?

14:01.477 --> 14:05.220
- Ever pronounced anyone?
- No, I've called time of death.

14:05.382 --> 14:09.955
The monitor shows no electrical
activity. Check the pupils.

14:11.975 --> 14:15.522
- Fixed and dilated.
- Feel for a pulse.

14:17.962 --> 14:20.450
- No palpable pulse.
- Listen for a heartbeat.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.690
Give it a minute.

14:23.627 --> 14:26.345
- That's it?
- That's it.

14:51.378 --> 14:54.608
- Can I help you?
- I'm Carol Hathaway. I'm on tonight.

14:54.771 --> 14:57.041
Gus Jackson, your pilot.
Did you bring cookies?

14:57.204 --> 14:59.888
- Was I supposed to?
- The patients expect it.

15:00.053 --> 15:01.515
- Got any valuables?
- No.

15:01.686 --> 15:05.200
- Good. Make yourself at home.
- Hey!

15:07.607 --> 15:09.877
You're late.
Did you bring the cookies?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.430
- What?
- Get in.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.115
- Hi, Doug.
- Hi, Carol.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.098
- I didn't know you were on.
- I tried not to be.

15:19.259 --> 15:24.596
A few things you should know. If we
come under fire, the window pops out.

15:24.796 --> 15:28.212
If anyone tries to steal anything,
let them take it. Remember...

15:28.414 --> 15:31.229
Am I supposed to wear
this bulletproof vest?

15:31.422 --> 15:36.028
Steer clear of the cabinets
while we're moving, and sit down.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.071
Right.

15:47.299 --> 15:49.503
- Mr. Jennings?
- Yes.

15:49.667 --> 15:52.057
- Jeanie Boulet. This is Dr. Doyle.
- Hello.

15:52.228 --> 15:54.465
How is Sophie? Is she all right?

15:54.661 --> 15:58.436
She's in
an extremely serious condition.

16:01.863 --> 16:07.429
- Has she been depressed lately?
- The past few months.

16:07.592 --> 16:11.303
Sophie's gotten so weak
she can barely sit up now.

16:11.466 --> 16:15.296
She won't talk to her friends.
I have to beg her to eat.

16:15.467 --> 16:19.363
- Does she take anti-depressants?
- They don't help anymore.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.079
We found a significant level
in her blood and urine.

16:23.245 --> 16:25.734
We think she attempted suicide.

16:27.086 --> 16:31.365
I've been praying.
What to do, how to help her.

16:31.567 --> 16:32.910
But...

16:34.288 --> 16:37.256
...she's been praying to die.

16:41.970 --> 16:45.037
- Susan! Welcome back!
- Dr. Lewis, how are you doing?

16:45.203 --> 16:47.058
Good.

16:47.220 --> 16:50.155
- Hi, Dr. Lewis. Welcome back.
- Thanks. How are you?

16:50.325 --> 16:53.108
- What are you?
- A kangaroo without a head.

16:53.237 --> 16:54.994
- Susan, hi!
- Mark!

16:55.158 --> 17:00.429
- Welcome back. You look...
- I look wet, but I feel great.

17:00.632 --> 17:02.487
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.

17:02.681 --> 17:05.398
Mark, you signed up for
that asthma patient in 4.

17:05.561 --> 17:07.416
- Can I...?
- Your research study?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.650
I really appreciate it.

17:09.818 --> 17:12.022
Good week?

17:12.186 --> 17:14.871
- Fractured her spleen.
- And ruptured her left kidney.

17:15.036 --> 17:17.655
Did you find my dad?
Is he coming to see me?

17:17.820 --> 17:19.512
Try not to talk.

17:19.676 --> 17:23.256
- Where am I going?
- To an operation to make you better.

17:23.391 --> 17:26.174
I want my dad. Is he okay?

17:27.166 --> 17:29.689
He's okay. We'll talk about it later.

17:29.856 --> 17:32.094
- Will you come see me?
- Yeah, I will.

17:32.289 --> 17:37.757
But right now try and relax and get
some sleep. You're gonna be fine.

17:39.843 --> 17:42.659
I didn't know what to say. I didn't
want to upset her before surgery.

17:42.820 --> 17:47.775
- She should've been told the truth.
- That could have delayed the surgery.

17:47.941 --> 17:51.521
Good instincts, Carter. Go in
and look after her until we're ready.

17:53.063 --> 17:57.571
I've got a diaphragmatic hernia
in two hours. Are you free?

17:57.704 --> 18:00.607
- Yeah.
- Good, because I have a conflict.

18:00.777 --> 18:03.745
I promised some children on the ward
I'd take them trick-or-treating.

18:03.946 --> 18:06.216
- Could you do that?
- Yeah.

18:06.379 --> 18:08.616
Great.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.748
I can't believe
you never made it to Hawaii.

18:11.917 --> 18:15.813
It turns out the fear of flying
cannot be conquered.

18:15.981 --> 18:19.812
When we landed in Phoenix,
they had to carry me off the plane.

18:19.983 --> 18:23.082
The thought of getting on another
plane was unbearable. Thanks.

18:23.247 --> 18:25.255
Anyway, Phoenix was great.

18:25.424 --> 18:30.411
Chloe is still sober, still working as
a claims adjuster. Six months now.

18:30.546 --> 18:33.962
Little Susie was fabulous.

18:34.162 --> 18:37.360
You know, she was...
She made me laugh.

18:38.484 --> 18:42.675
- Anyway, how are you?
- I don't want to talk about it.

18:44.502 --> 18:45.844
Pretty bad.

18:46.870 --> 18:50.100
Kerry's got Anspaugh wrapped around
her finger. He loved her project.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.014
- He wants me to do one on pus.
- Pus?

18:53.176 --> 18:57.301
Not to mention the fact that he's
given her the only tenure slot.

18:57.881 --> 19:00.784
So I have no career, no future.
You know...

19:00.922 --> 19:03.825
Really, I don't want to
talk about it, okay?

19:03.995 --> 19:06.003
Sure, Mark. Whatever.

19:07.517 --> 19:12.668
- You hungry? We could eat at Doc's.
- No, I ate on the train home.

19:15.166 --> 19:18.463
There's a Halloween party tonight
at the Jazz Note.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.592
I was thinking maybe
if you're not too tired...

19:22.688 --> 19:25.537
- Well...
- The whole staff's going.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.568
- That sounds great.
- Great.

19:28.739 --> 19:31.292
Yikes! Where did these come from?

19:33.668 --> 19:36.735
Some drug rep was giving them away.

19:40.773 --> 19:43.676
Here you go.
This is helpful right here.

19:43.879 --> 19:46.629
You've got gauze, penicillin...

19:48.040 --> 19:50.976
When was this stuff stocked?
"Expiration: 1989"?

19:51.145 --> 19:55.488
The Healthmobile's from Southside.
Their budgets are tighter than ours.

19:59.947 --> 20:02.698
Do you get the feeling
he doesn't care about us?

20:05.901 --> 20:09.797
Carol, what are you doing
with a physics book?

20:09.966 --> 20:13.316
- It's a friend's.
- You borrowed it for late-night reading?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.976
- Very funny. Give it back.
- Look at this.

20:16.176 --> 20:18.216
- Doug!
- I'm getting flashbacks!

20:18.384 --> 20:21.451
- You two ready?
- Yes. Thank you, Gus.

20:21.617 --> 20:24.782
Welcome to Gonorrhea Land.

20:28.147 --> 20:33.899
- This is truly depressing.
- Yeah, like County on a slow night.

20:34.069 --> 20:36.623
Here's your first customer.

20:37.718 --> 20:39.759
Come in. All right.

20:41.303 --> 20:44.468
- What's the problem?
- Where are the cookies?

20:44.664 --> 20:47.348
- Could you tell us what's wrong?
- Where are the cookies?

20:52.731 --> 20:56.114
- Is she in pain?
- I don't think so.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.475
First time in two years.

21:01.501 --> 21:04.120
I love you, Sophie.

21:05.470 --> 21:07.031
I love you.

21:13.665 --> 21:17.889
This morning, she was different.

21:18.082 --> 21:20.733
Smiling like she used to.

21:22.179 --> 21:28.826
She wanted me to comb her hair,
help her with some lipstick.

21:28.997 --> 21:33.570
Then she looked at me and said,
"I'm ready."

21:40.424 --> 21:42.727
She begged me.

21:44.842 --> 21:49.578
I counted them out. Crushed
them up. Put them in some milk.

21:49.739 --> 21:55.370
I held a glass to her mouth.
She said, "I love you."

21:56.461 --> 21:59.015
And the next thing you know...

22:00.013 --> 22:03.877
...she's asleep.
But I got scared...

22:04.047 --> 22:07.114
...called the ambulance.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.096
Her whole life, she helped me.

22:11.249 --> 22:14.152
I wasn't strong enough to help her.

22:19.027 --> 22:22.159
I can't lose her.

22:22.324 --> 22:24.594
I can't.

22:29.430 --> 22:31.765
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

22:31.927 --> 22:34.710
Do you have those animals
pediatricians use?

22:34.872 --> 22:37.808
Pocket peek-a-boo's.

22:39.482 --> 22:41.937
- I don't know.
- Maybe the beanbag bunnies?

22:43.482 --> 22:47.258
- We have dinosaur pencils.
- Those are my favorites.

22:47.420 --> 22:51.578
Brontosaurus,
Stegosaurus, Dimetradon...

22:51.772 --> 22:55.668
Just the paper. So Dr. Keaton
got you down here buying props?

22:55.870 --> 22:58.074
No, I'm just looking around.

22:58.238 --> 23:00.956
She sends down all Residents
who don't like kids.

23:02.496 --> 23:05.246
- I like kids.
- Sure, we all like kids.

23:05.409 --> 23:10.266
Bears are playing Tampa Bay?
Hardly need to watch that one.

23:12.419 --> 23:14.274
Tyrannosaurus rex?

23:15.523 --> 23:18.426
- Your lungs are clear.
- Thank heavens!

23:18.597 --> 23:22.853
I'm always so worried about germs.
Don't I know you?

23:24.198 --> 23:27.046
- No, you don't.
- Are you sure we haven't met?

23:27.239 --> 23:31.681
- Yep, I'm sure.
- I know, at the Club 99. Right?

23:31.848 --> 23:35.908
Debby, you're done. Got it?

23:36.074 --> 23:38.791
I was just kidding around.

23:40.138 --> 23:44.231
- Anyone else out there?
- Only about 20 or 30 more.

23:45.900 --> 23:49.643
Oh, my God!
It's stuck! Please, help me!

23:49.774 --> 23:53.801
Hang on! We're not equipped for
a stabbing. Call an ambulance!

23:54.511 --> 23:56.967
Help me! It hurts!

23:57.167 --> 24:00.234
Give me some gloves! Larger!

24:02.193 --> 24:04.299
Trick or treat!

24:06.194 --> 24:08.781
That's not funny.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.527
- Where's my treat?
- We're all out.

24:12.692 --> 24:15.147
- Can I get condoms?
- How old are you?

24:16.597 --> 24:20.428
- Eighteen.
- Come back when you're 15.

24:20.950 --> 24:23.537
Screw it.
My dates don't like them anyway.

24:23.703 --> 24:25.711
Wait a minute!
What's your name?

24:25.912 --> 24:28.247
- Charlie.
- You're working the streets?

24:28.408 --> 24:31.704
- What do you think?
- I think you're at risk for AIDS.

24:31.897 --> 24:36.208
- Where are you living?
- In a penthouse on Lakeshore Drive.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.348
Hey! Hey!

24:45.630 --> 24:48.697
- Be careful out there, all right?
- Thanks, old man.

24:50.751 --> 24:54.843
Susie was so cute. She thinks
the word for cactus is "ouch."

24:55.008 --> 24:59.287
We'd go for a walk, and she'd
point everywhere going, "Ouch, ouch."

25:00.418 --> 25:02.655
- Jerry?
- I've called Maintenance four times.

25:02.819 --> 25:06.944
- They're working on it.
- It's the ghost on the fifth floor.

25:07.108 --> 25:10.721
- Not you too!
- It's true. He's up there.

25:10.885 --> 25:14.333
- Still pining for the woman he loved.
- I thought he broke her heart.

25:14.501 --> 25:18.015
- He broke his own heart.
- How do you know this?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.672
Because that's the story.

25:20.840 --> 25:25.598
It was Halloween night,
the 1930s, up on the fifth floor.

25:25.737 --> 25:28.804
There was rain
and thunder and lightning.

25:28.970 --> 25:32.451
- He was a doctor, she was an intern.
- She loved him, didn't she?

25:34.092 --> 25:38.119
But a wealthy, handsome patient
had asked her to marry him.

25:38.285 --> 25:40.707
- What did she say?
- She didn't know what to say.

25:40.877 --> 25:43.878
- So she told the doctor.
- What did he say?

25:44.942 --> 25:47.245
- He said nothing.
- I thought he loved her.

25:47.407 --> 25:50.375
He did love her,
but he couldn't get the words out.

25:50.544 --> 25:55.433
She walked across the room,
turned back and looked at him.

25:56.434 --> 26:00.942
She put her hand to her lips and
blew what would be their only kiss.

26:01.107 --> 26:04.424
They say it blew through him
like a rush of cold wind.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.978
- That is so sad.
- What happened?

26:08.181 --> 26:11.924
Unfortunately, the doc fell out of
the fifth-floor window, so that's it.

26:12.118 --> 26:15.632
I'm sure they worked on him
in the O.R. For a while.

26:18.168 --> 26:21.781
- Have you seen Benton?
- Not for a couple of hours.

26:21.945 --> 26:24.815
He's got me pulling articles
on Dieulafoy's lesions.

26:24.986 --> 26:27.059
- Never heard of it.
- Here's your chance.

26:27.195 --> 26:29.268
No, thanks.

26:32.572 --> 26:36.916
- Dr. Keaton.
- How is she doing?

26:37.118 --> 26:40.053
Pretty well.
The pressure's 100 over 75.

26:40.926 --> 26:45.434
- Her kidney's still working.
- I'll stay until she comes out of it.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.318
- I thought you had discharges.
- They're done.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.691
Mostly.

26:51.233 --> 26:55.424
Call me when she wakes up.
I need to tell her about her father.

26:57.155 --> 27:02.045
Dr. Keaton, I think I need
to tell her about her father.

27:08.807 --> 27:09.952
It's none of your business.

27:10.151 --> 27:12.802
I'm just curious, if you're thinking
about medical school.

27:12.967 --> 27:14.593
You're done.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.795
It's just a physics class,
which I doubt I'll make it through...

27:17.962 --> 27:20.297
...much less go to medical school.

27:20.458 --> 27:23.241
Doc, we've got
a guy staggering out here.

27:23.403 --> 27:26.022
Help! Help me!

27:26.188 --> 27:27.715
Move!

27:29.452 --> 27:31.787
What is it?

27:33.006 --> 27:34.632
Call 911. He's been stabbed.

27:34.798 --> 27:38.214
Set up an IV.
Did anybody see what happened?

27:39.088 --> 27:42.536
- Did anybody see what happened?
- No, man.

27:42.736 --> 27:46.828
Look out! I couldn't find an
angiocath, but I got an 18-gauge needle.

27:46.993 --> 27:49.961
Jab it into his antecubital vein,
and tape his arm down.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.710
- Come on, buddy!
- I'm in.

27:53.875 --> 27:55.763
Check his palp.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.436
- What's wrong?
- We've got company.

28:02.486 --> 28:05.007
- We're losing him. I'll do a cutdown.
- Out here?

28:05.143 --> 28:08.821
We've gotta get more fluids in him.
Got a scalpel, anything sharp?

28:08.984 --> 28:12.367
- Anything sharp!
- Here, use these!

28:12.569 --> 28:14.577
- All right.
- Hey, doc!

28:14.777 --> 28:17.145
The ambulance will be here
in 15 minutes.

28:17.338 --> 28:19.576
He won't make it.
How fast will that go?

28:19.739 --> 28:24.180
- It's faster than waiting.
- Let's do it! Come on, let's go!

28:26.237 --> 28:28.474
Mr. Jennings.

28:28.637 --> 28:31.769
I need to turn off the monitor now.

28:37.152 --> 28:40.055
Time of death: 8:53.

28:41.281 --> 28:46.072
- Would you like to stay with her?
- Thank you.

28:49.859 --> 28:52.446
What I did...

28:52.869 --> 28:56.033
I don't know if it was right or wrong.

28:56.197 --> 29:02.047
- She was in a lot of pain.
- But her whole marriage...

29:02.215 --> 29:06.526
...it was never about giving up on life.
This is not who we were.

29:10.185 --> 29:13.831
You stayed with her.
You helped her when she needed you.

29:15.178 --> 29:17.066
I think that's who you were.

29:25.326 --> 29:27.334
Got an ET tube.
Can't find a laryngoscope.

29:27.502 --> 29:31.081
I'll have to go in blind. All right,
Gus, you've made your point!

29:31.247 --> 29:34.860
- Don't you want to get there?
- He's tubed. Give me the ambu-bag.

29:35.025 --> 29:37.065
Right here.

29:37.841 --> 29:40.559
Hit it. We're in.

29:40.978 --> 29:43.630
- What are you doing?
- Putting him in Trendelenburg.

29:45.332 --> 29:47.220
- I'm having trouble.
- What?

29:47.380 --> 29:49.966
My ambu-bag's got a leak.
I need some tape.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.075
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

29:56.566 --> 30:00.758
- The trick-or-treaters are waiting.
- Thanks.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.790
I have the articles
when you want them.

30:03.961 --> 30:06.776
- Did you write the post-op notes?
- Yes.

30:06.937 --> 30:11.958
Good. If you can,
pull the drains on the pyloroplasty.

30:13.916 --> 30:17.332
- Why are you riding me?
- You're an intern.

30:17.500 --> 30:21.211
I bust my ass, and you
give me a mediocre evaluation.

30:21.374 --> 30:24.441
- Most interns do mediocre work.
- I don't.

30:24.607 --> 30:28.438
- You could do better.
- So can Carter, so can everyone.

30:28.607 --> 30:31.904
- You have to do better.
- I have to do better?

30:32.065 --> 30:35.895
Is that because I'm black?
Is that your message?

30:37.058 --> 30:38.651
Let me ask you something.

30:38.818 --> 30:43.577
When you applied to med school, did
you check the box "African American"?

30:43.717 --> 30:45.889
I worked just as hard
as everyone else.

30:46.053 --> 30:50.691
People think that you checked the box
to get preferential treatment.

30:50.887 --> 30:52.927
They assume you're here
to fill a quota.

30:53.127 --> 30:57.700
To prove them wrong, you have to work
twice as hard to be twice as good.

30:57.865 --> 30:59.589
Think I need you to tell me that?

30:59.753 --> 31:03.463
We understand each other,
so we don't have a problem, do we?

31:03.626 --> 31:06.791
- Did you check the box?
- No.

31:06.955 --> 31:12.674
Maybe you should tell people, so you
don't have to prove it all the time.

31:30.481 --> 31:34.345
- Hi there.
- You stayed.

31:34.514 --> 31:38.028
You did really well.
You're going to be fine.

31:39.924 --> 31:44.235
I wanted to talk to you.
I have something I need to tell you.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.981
About my dad?

31:49.783 --> 31:51.442
Yes.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.208
He died, didn't he?

31:57.369 --> 31:59.606
Is that it?

32:03.387 --> 32:04.882
Yes.

32:18.143 --> 32:21.111
- What've we got?
- Knife wound in the abdomen. Needs lap.

32:21.248 --> 32:24.064
- Let's get him to the O.R.
- How is it? I'm going next week.

32:24.225 --> 32:26.844
- No big deal. Real smooth.
- Bring cookies.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.601
That's it.

32:30.595 --> 32:33.498
Have a good night, Gus!

32:34.853 --> 32:37.853
I'm not gonna say anything
about that physics book.

32:38.021 --> 32:41.983
- It was probably a stupid idea.
- Lf it's what you want to do...

32:42.150 --> 32:46.145
- lf I can make it, anybody can.
- Thanks.

32:53.257 --> 32:56.258
- Going to the Halloween party?
- No, can't make it.

32:56.427 --> 33:00.683
- I hear Haleh's really good.
- She is. I heard her last Christmas.

33:03.884 --> 33:06.700
That case with Mr. Jennings today...

33:07.181 --> 33:10.444
When I saw him watching her
and holding her hand...

33:12.751 --> 33:15.786
...I kind of saw
what their whole life had been.

33:15.952 --> 33:19.979
It made me wish that we could
save her so that we could save him.

33:20.145 --> 33:21.389
What do you mean?

33:22.514 --> 33:25.450
He's alone. Left with all the pain.

33:26.387 --> 33:29.683
She fell asleep in her husband's arms.

33:40.791 --> 33:42.766
I'll see you.

33:46.297 --> 33:50.160
Dr. Greene, I'm going to
remind you one more time.

33:50.330 --> 33:53.811
I'm on my way. I'll take
Susan with me for protection.

33:55.675 --> 33:58.872
- Protection from what?
- The ghost on the fifth floor.

33:59.036 --> 34:01.688
Why do we have to go up there?

34:01.886 --> 34:05.596
A guy corked off. I have to
pronounce him. Are you scared?

34:05.758 --> 34:08.027
Of course not.

34:09.791 --> 34:11.253
- Mark?
- Susan?

34:11.456 --> 34:14.904
- Good, you're still there.
- Where would I go?

34:15.072 --> 34:18.041
Hey, slow down!
All right, that's it!

34:18.210 --> 34:20.764
Come on, we're going back.
It's past your bedtimes.

34:20.931 --> 34:23.801
- Please, can we go to one more floor?
- Yeah, one more floor!

34:23.972 --> 34:26.842
- Be a sport, Peter.
- Yeah, be a sport.

34:26.980 --> 34:30.145
- Nurse "B-jerk" would let us.
- Bjerke. Yes, I would.

34:30.309 --> 34:34.304
All right. Look, we'll go the ER,
but that's it.

34:34.502 --> 34:36.574
- Mister!
- What?

34:36.775 --> 34:39.231
- I have to pee, bad.
- Oh, man!

34:39.431 --> 34:42.597
The rest of you just hold hands
until I get back. Don't move.

34:42.761 --> 34:46.536
- What do you think we are? Babies?
- Just don't move. Come on.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.815
- Do we have to do this now?
- We could wait until daylight.

34:51.978 --> 34:54.947
He'll only have been dead
about 10 hours.

35:01.262 --> 35:03.914
- Oh, my...
- Next bed, doctor.

35:04.079 --> 35:06.949
Sorry.
You're not scared, huh?

35:18.323 --> 35:21.007
- Did you feel that?
- What?

35:21.172 --> 35:24.468
- You're going to think I'm crazy.
- Feel what?

35:24.629 --> 35:28.623
I swear it was just like
a rush of wind went through me.

35:28.790 --> 35:30.830
You are crazy.

35:30.967 --> 35:32.756
- Oh, boy!
- Did you feel it?

35:32.919 --> 35:36.717
No, I didn't feel anything.
Oh, boy!

35:36.889 --> 35:39.126
You felt it, didn't you?

35:39.321 --> 35:45.750
- Dr. Carter? Did you tell her?
- She knew.

35:45.915 --> 35:49.745
She said that her father had
kissed her goodbye during surgery.

35:49.916 --> 35:54.620
Kids know. It's as if their parent's
spirit joins them, and...

35:54.782 --> 35:56.790
...they just seem to know.

35:56.958 --> 35:58.136
I knew.

35:58.302 --> 36:01.599
My brother died of leukemia.
I was riding home from school one day.

36:01.760 --> 36:06.300
I just knew he had died.
I felt like he was with me.

36:06.977 --> 36:10.326
Maybe that's why
you're good with kids.

36:10.530 --> 36:12.920
See you in the morning.

36:17.156 --> 36:20.419
- Hey! Where are those kids?
- What?

36:20.613 --> 36:23.713
- I don't know where they went.
- Hey, come here!

36:23.878 --> 36:26.366
Come on.
How could you let them go?

36:26.535 --> 36:30.246
I looked up and they were gone.
Check the ER. I'll call upstairs.

36:37.674 --> 36:41.636
<i>I took my troubles</i>
<i>Down to Madame Rue</i>

36:41.803 --> 36:45.481
<i>Ya know that gypsy</i>
<i>With the gold- capped tooth</i>

36:45.644 --> 36:49.606
<i>She's got a storefront</i>
<i>At 34th and Vine</i>

36:49.774 --> 36:56.715
<i>She sells little bottles</i>
<i>Of love potion number nine</i>

36:56.879 --> 36:58.735
Boo!

37:01.393 --> 37:03.281
Come on, Lily.

37:03.441 --> 37:06.671
- Riyadh is like a bake oven.
- Sounds bad.

37:06.802 --> 37:09.935
But Norm would fix
these desert cocktails.

37:10.100 --> 37:14.607
Equal parts potassium,
sodium, with a lemon chaser.

37:15.572 --> 37:18.323
There she is.
Sucking up to him a bit more.

37:18.486 --> 37:21.204
- Mark...
- Disparaging and belittling me.

37:21.367 --> 37:24.018
She's tightening her grip
on that tenure slot.

37:24.183 --> 37:27.446
- What's the problem?
- She's making everything competitive.

37:27.608 --> 37:30.904
You're a doctor, you love competition.
You're just obsessed.

37:31.065 --> 37:33.270
- I am not.
- A little myopic, then.

37:33.850 --> 37:34.996
What?

37:37.627 --> 37:41.557
Your wife divorced you, you don't see
Rachel. You just care about the job.

37:41.692 --> 37:44.540
I just spent a week where no one
was stabbing people in the back.

37:44.701 --> 37:48.018
I could drop everything,
take a walk with Susie.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.940
The big decision
was what to have for lunch.

37:51.103 --> 37:54.551
There's other stuff out there.
I know you don't have it now.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.790
I just hate to see you
get caught up in that.

38:00.482 --> 38:04.411
<i>He broke my little bottle</i>

38:07.011 --> 38:09.281
What are you doing here?
You weren't supposed to move.

38:09.444 --> 38:13.340
- You found us, didn't you?
- We could've lost you, if we wanted to.

38:13.478 --> 38:16.643
- Let's go back up to the ward.
- Didn't you go trick-or-treating?

38:16.807 --> 38:20.103
- Yes, I've gone trick-or-treating.
- What did you go as?

38:21.415 --> 38:25.442
- Once I went as a scientist.
- Bet no one gave you any candy.

38:26.473 --> 38:31.176
- We had to do tricks to get treats.
- Bet you can't do one now.

38:31.338 --> 38:35.333
- Yeah! Do a trick! Do a trick!
- Hey, hey, hey!

38:35.500 --> 38:37.737
Shut up, all right?

38:38.860 --> 38:40.966
Just one.

38:58.098 --> 39:01.448
- How was that?
- That was it?

39:17.079 --> 39:20.015
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

39:20.185 --> 39:24.015
They say those trains run every 10
minutes, but I don't believe it.

39:24.218 --> 39:27.415
- You never change, do you?
- What?

39:27.578 --> 39:31.322
- Just unbelievable excuses.
- I said I'm sorry.

39:31.515 --> 39:36.121
I never changed either. "Hang
in there. Carry the marriage alone."

39:36.285 --> 39:40.181
- "Don't think about who he is with."
- What's wrong?

39:46.304 --> 39:51.161
A man came in today and sat there
and watched his wife die.

39:53.570 --> 39:59.649
He helped her to die because
she was in pain. And he loved her.

40:04.165 --> 40:06.467
But we didn't have
that kind of marriage.

40:06.630 --> 40:10.243
We didn't love or cherish.
We didn't respect!

40:10.407 --> 40:13.474
And now you have killed me!

40:24.043 --> 40:27.175
This drink is strong.
I should've eaten something.

40:27.371 --> 40:30.853
- We should've eaten before this.
- Yeah.

40:31.052 --> 40:35.723
- You want to... Go ahead.
- You want to... Go ahead.

40:35.886 --> 40:39.236
You're probably too tired
after your trip to dance.

40:39.407 --> 40:42.310
- Kind of, but...
- Maybe later.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.066
I guess I'm up for it.

40:48.178 --> 40:51.791
<i>I'll sing to him</i>

40:51.923 --> 40:55.601
<i>Each spring to him</i>

40:55.764 --> 41:02.836
<i>And long for the day</i>
<i>When I cling to him</i>

41:02.998 --> 41:09.328
<i>Bewitched, bothered and bewildered</i>

41:09.496 --> 41:14.713
<i>Am I</i>

41:14.873 --> 41:21.204
<i>Oh, bewitched</i>
<i>Bothered and bewildered</i>
