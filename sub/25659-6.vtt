Months later, the stallion
returned with a pregnant mare.

So, taming the mare,
er's son fell and broke his leg.

why did fate spare him?

23:03.200 --> 23:05.120
It's like survivor's guilt.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.200

ht. That's why I left a message.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.160
ge row with mum, couldn't sleep.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.680
st remind her you're a teenager,

31:04.720 --> 31:07.120
that your inner chimp
will be driving for a while.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.760
let me hang out with my friends.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.440
just wants to know you're safe.
-[door]

31:10.480 --> 31:13.000
Oh, I heard her door.
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.600
Daisy.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.560
Charming.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.560
Hey, Elsa.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.520
-Morning.
-Morning.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.440
-Coffee?
-Please.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.640
So...

31:27.520 --> 31:28.680
We can't keep running.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.600
need to take the fight to Blake.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.600
Well, how do we do that?

31:33.960 --> 31:36.760
blic. We hold a press conference
somewhere totally safe,

31:36.800 --> 31:39.560
somewhere out in the open...
plenty of protection.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.520
se Blake, we expose his methods.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.760
We do that,
n Hutchinson will let him swing.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.200
-You think?
-I know. He told me.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.640
reat, we make our move on Blake,
bring him in, lock him up.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.720
Oh, in case you're wondering,
that was pretty good last night.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.000
I've had worse.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.320
Why was I frisked?

32:30.280 --> 32:32.080
otocols, nothing to worry about.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.720
I'm not worried.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.000
Hmm, maybe you should be.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.800
Elsa Gray has organised
a press conference.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.000
If she exposes you...

32:43.200 --> 32:45.120
I can't guarantee MI6 support.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.800
You called me here for that?

32:49.560 --> 32:52.000
-Thought it merited a heads-up.
-Don't lie.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.160
e's just as much a threat to you
as she is to me.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.200
She's no threat to me.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
really believe that if I fall...

33:02.800 --> 33:04.280
I fall alone?

33:06.400 --> 33:07.640
[sighs] Look at you.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.360
You think you can match me?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.200
Barely out of school...

33:14.280 --> 33:16.440
-This meeting's over.
-I'll decide when it's over.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.520
This...

33:20.040 --> 33:21.200
heads-up...

33:23.640 --> 33:27.640
you want me to murder Elsa Gray
before she can open her mouth...

33:28.680 --> 33:30.320
you haven't the balls to say it,
have you?

33:35.160 --> 33:36.480
[yells] Have you?

33:38.720 --> 33:40.600
nk you've got the measure of me?

33:42.520 --> 33:45.400
nk you can stare into the abyss?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.600
-Please...
-Where you gonna hide...

33:50.200 --> 33:51.520
when the abyss stares back?

33:52.480 --> 33:55.120
n your fucking sterile corridor?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.320
[gasping]

34:05.200 --> 34:06.600
[knocking]

34:11.000 --> 34:13.400
-Rich's flat.
-What's happened now?

34:15.160 --> 34:16.560
No way?

34:16.600 --> 34:18.000
-Told you I'd get it back.
-How'd you do it?

34:18.440 --> 34:21.040
-How'd you think?
ought it wasn't working anymore.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.680
n, I'm sorry to ruin the shining
but Gray needs us straight away.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.520
Well, before you rush off,
we've got something to tell you.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.120
h, you're not pregnant, are you?
-No.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.160
Uh, I'm moving in with Suri.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.080
t you didn't even need the flat?

34:35.240 --> 34:37.600
m sorry. Still a little bit raw?
-Hmm.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.040
No, it's great.
I'm delighted for both of you.

34:40.680 --> 34:41.800
Come on.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.640
See you later.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.400
-Dirty bastard.
-[Suri tuts]

34:52.200 --> 34:53.760
arry] I've never seen my brother
look so happy.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.400
, how did you win back the flat?

34:56.800 --> 34:59.080
alls of steel and a bit of luck.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.720
h says your luck is running out.

35:03.640 --> 35:04.800
What else does he say?

35:05.200 --> 35:07.360
aid that bracelet came from Eve.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.160
this when we were in Hong Kong.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.800
Yes, but the way you said it,
ade sure I wouldn't believe you.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.240
To protect you.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.480
I should've known,
ould've been a better colleague.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.200
Suri, I couldn't have wished
for a better colleague.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.720
now on, I'm with you every step,
you've gotta be honest with me.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.440
[he sighs]

35:28.240 --> 35:29.800
Rich was right.

35:30.200 --> 35:33.800
is running out. When this turns
lack, that's it, my luck's gone.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.440
But you won back the flat.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.800
are you sure about the bracelet?

35:40.320 --> 35:43.200
I mean, a lucky charm,
every gambler has one of those?

35:43.560 --> 35:46.000
The flame burns brightest
before it dies...

35:47.200 --> 35:49.760
That's why, to bring Blake down,
we have to act now.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.200
This my last roll of the dice.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.480
Orwell doesn't like your plan
of going public.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.400
You're already a target,
two attempts on your life.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.800
We stage a press conference,
we have to publicise it,

36:15.040 --> 36:16.720
that puts you right
back in the line of fire.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.200
So what are we supposed to do?

36:19.480 --> 36:21.120
Just sit around and wait
until Blake picks her off?

36:21.560 --> 36:24.360
No. The way we go about this
ill reinforce how crucial it is.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.680
We need maximum exposure
in a controlled environment...

36:28.040 --> 36:29.320
Leave Blake nowhere to hide.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.600
I've seen you risk your life
time and time again.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.760
ine. This is someone else's life
you're putting in danger.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.520
I think that's my call.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.560
Look, every major decision,
Harry's got right.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.400
If it stops Blake,
it's a risk worth taking.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.400
-We just need time--
-We haven't got time!

36:50.400 --> 36:51.760
Blake murdered your driver.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.000
I think you owe him.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.240
You're right. We go public.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.120
So we do this. Together.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.240
y, the press have been notified.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.280
The venue is the main steps
at Greenwich Barracks.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.600
I've arranged security.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.560
There are metal detectors
on all the doors.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.200
The rooms have been swept
using sniffer dogs.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.480
o one gets in or out without ID.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.120
We've got an SUV
with full ballistic protection.

37:23.280 --> 37:26.040
ake catches wind of any of this,
tries anything...

37:26.400 --> 37:28.160
uch putting his balls in a vice.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.040
He might enjoy that.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.600
I've got to be there.

37:33.320 --> 37:35.000
It'll only work if I'm there.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.640
l] You keep a low profile Harry,
you're still a wanted man.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.320
All right, we leave in an hour.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.560
[chatter]

38:00.400 --> 38:01.800
[phone ringing]

38:05.280 --> 38:06.680
Suri, it's Rich.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.560
I can't talk now,
we're on our way to a job.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.480
Look, listen. I've been thinking
about that story you told me.

38:12.280 --> 38:15.480
at if Harry winning my flat back
is actually bad luck?

38:16.200 --> 38:18.000
What if something
terrible is about to happen?

38:18.520 --> 38:22.120
ry was about accepting your fate
d not worrying about the future.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.560
Suri, is this job dangerous?

38:24.800 --> 38:28.320
t's probably the most secure job
I've done since joining MIS.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.160
-Where is it?
-I can't tell you that.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.520
Look, I need to go.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.760
-Come on.
- Come on, Suri.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.640
It'll put my mind at rest.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.320
're going to Greenwich Barracks.
What could be safer?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.800
[Gray] Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

39:42.200 --> 39:46.800
ective Superintendent Elsa Gray,
ndon Murder Investigation Squad.

39:47.520 --> 39:52.360
I believe, at the highest levels
of our security services...

39:52.680 --> 39:56.040
a moral vacuum
and a lack of accountability.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.520
hen an MI6 agent takes the lives
of innocent people...

40:04.800 --> 40:09.200
attempts to murder my officers,
hen I am compelled to intervene.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.800
have the corroborating evidence.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.280
rruption at the highest level...

40:22.040 --> 40:25.640
and it has to command
a maximum prison sentence.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.440
I followed procedure
to address this issue.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.520
I was met with contempt.

40:33.280 --> 40:38.760
ress conference is a last resort
to tackle this corruption.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.000
-Gun!
-[screaming]

40:41.040 --> 40:42.720
Stay where you are! Put it down!

40:43.160 --> 40:45.160
Down! Put the gun down!

40:52.800 --> 40:54.160
[exhales]

40:56.280 --> 40:57.520
Hands in the air.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.040
Step away from the gun.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.120
Are you still having fun?

41:09.400 --> 41:10.760
You still think that's lucky?

41:16.120 --> 41:17.200
Eve.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.160
Sniper!

41:25.200 --> 41:26.360
Everybody down.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.600
[screaming]

41:38.480 --> 41:40.000
[shocked gasp]

41:45.400 --> 41:46.760
No. No!

41:47.120 --> 41:49.720
No, Suri! Suri, Suri, Suri.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.080
-Do something!
-Yes!

41:52.120 --> 41:53.560
Suri. Suri. Hey.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.200
Hey.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.080
Ambulance needed immediately.
To Greenwich Barracks.

41:57.120 --> 41:59.360
e fading] Officer has been shot.
We need urgent assistance.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.280
Suri. Suri, can you hear me?

42:01.320 --> 42:03.080
Suri, Suri, stay with me, stay.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.760
Stay, Suri, please.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.600
Stay. Come on. Come on, Suri.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.040
Stay. Stay. [sobs]

42:10.200 --> 42:11.280
Oh, God.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.120
Oh...

42:16.160 --> 42:17.200
Suri...

42:17.600 --> 42:18.720
Suri.
