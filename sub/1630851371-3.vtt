00:03.004 --> 00:06.422
Nick:<i> In last week's</i>
<i> season premiere event,</i>

00:06.465 --> 00:10.384
<i> we were introduced</i>
<i> to the undercover stars</i>
<i> of group a.</i>

00:10.386 --> 00:12.886
- ( vocalizing )
- that's amazing!

00:12.888 --> 00:16.890
One of the best
vocal performances I've ever
witnessed in my life.

00:16.934 --> 00:20.060
<i> And we learned the competition</i>
<i> this season is fierce.</i>

00:20.104 --> 00:23.355
- Take it off!
- Dwight howard!

00:23.399 --> 00:25.357
Vivica a. Fox!

00:25.401 --> 00:28.068
Toni braxton!

00:28.112 --> 00:31.280
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god!

00:31.323 --> 00:34.283
<i> Tonight, you're invited</i>
<i> to tinseltown's</i>

00:34.326 --> 00:37.327
<i> most exclusive</i>
<i> black tie affair.</i>

00:38.873 --> 00:40.664
<i> Get your detective hats on</i>

00:40.666 --> 00:44.626
<i> because group b</i>
<i> is hitting the red carpet,</i>

00:44.670 --> 00:47.379
<i> and they know how</i>
<i> to make an entrance.</i>

00:47.423 --> 00:50.924
- Ken: Wow!
- I'm stumped already.

00:50.968 --> 00:54.136
You know what will help?
It's someone famous.

00:54.138 --> 00:57.056
<i> But it's not all rhinestones</i>
<i> and bowties,</i>

00:57.099 --> 00:59.850
<i> because at the end</i>
<i> of this masked gala,</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:02.895
<i> someone's losing their head.</i>

01:02.938 --> 01:05.397
- Ah!
- Amazing!

01:05.399 --> 01:09.234
<i> The group b premiere</i>
<i> starts in three...</i>

01:09.278 --> 01:11.361
After that performance,
that's a star right there.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.490
-<i> Two... </i>
- An iconic legend!

01:14.533 --> 01:16.241
<i> ...One.</i>

01:19.121 --> 01:22.122
-<i> ♪ who  </i>
- oh, yeah.

01:22.166 --> 01:25.042
<i> ♪ who are you? </i>

01:25.086 --> 01:27.252
<i> ♪ who, who, who, who </i>

01:27.296 --> 01:28.462
<i> ♪ come on, tell me,</i>
<i> who are you? ♪</i>

01:28.506 --> 01:31.507

<i> ♪ are you? </i>

01:42.978 --> 01:44.353
Oh, it's nick cannon.

01:44.396 --> 01:48.023
- Nick cannon!
- Welcome to the show, y'all.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.025
Ken: Wow.

01:50.069 --> 01:53.946
It's a black tie affair here
on "the masked singer."

01:53.989 --> 01:56.865
tonight, we are back,
and it's time to meet

01:56.867 --> 01:59.827
our new batch of masked
hopefuls, group b.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.203
- Yes!
- Wow.

02:01.247 --> 02:04.123
So strap yourselves in
because as good as group a was,

02:04.125 --> 02:07.876
I'm told our newcomers
are an even stronger,

02:07.920 --> 02:09.837
wackier collection
of star power.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.297
Which of them will end up
in the finale

02:12.341 --> 02:14.967
battling it out
with our group a winner?

02:15.010 --> 02:17.094
Only time will tell.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.637
Now let's say hello

02:18.639 --> 02:21.849
to the most camera ready
detectives in all of tv.

02:21.892 --> 02:26.061
- You guys.
- Make some noise.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.152
You guys are fly tonight.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.654
Everybody's so fly.
Don't they look good?

02:35.698 --> 02:38.240
Yeah, not as fly
as your two-mile robe
that you came in on.

02:38.284 --> 02:40.075
- Now that's a cape.
- Yeah.

02:40.119 --> 02:43.078
- You liked that, huh?
- I hate it, but it--

02:45.166 --> 02:48.250
now let's get started
with a character
that reeks of royalty.

02:48.294 --> 02:53.505
Audience, bow your heads
and prepare to fall in love
with queen of hearts.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.257
Yeah!

02:56.635 --> 03:00.095
- Oh!
- Jenny: Yes!

03:00.097 --> 03:04.057
- Oh, my gosh,
that is so cool!
- Robin: Yeah.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.851
Oh, she's going off now.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.687
- That is gorgeous.
- Whoo!

03:08.731 --> 03:10.397
Nick:
Truly a heartbreaker.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.442
She walks like a pro.

03:16.614 --> 03:17.529
All right.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.365
Ooh, look at those legs.
Maybe she's a model.

03:20.367 --> 03:25.537
This one is definitely gonna be
a royal pain to figure out.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.248
Let's hear why
she dreamed of this day,

03:28.292 --> 03:30.292
and the story
may be a clue itself.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.674
Queen of hearts:
<i> They say if you</i>
<i> follow your heart,</i>

03:39.094 --> 03:42.095
<i> it's gonna lead you</i>
<i> on some amazing adventures.</i>

03:42.223 --> 03:44.097
- Wow, that's a strong
southern accent.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.225
<i> I'm pretty excited to</i>
<i> do some things on this stage</i>

03:46.227 --> 03:47.935
<i> that I never</i>
<i> thought I would do.</i>

03:48.062 --> 03:49.269
"the wizard of oz."
tin man.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.899
<i> But the truth is,</i>
<i> I have spent my entire life</i>

03:53.901 --> 03:57.236
<i> learning how to champion</i>
<i> my own heart.</i>

03:59.531 --> 04:02.699
<i> Growing up, there wasn't a lot</i>
<i> of warmth in my household.</i>

04:05.204 --> 04:07.120
<i> I left home</i>
<i> when I was pretty young,</i>

04:07.164 --> 04:08.914
<i> and it was definitely</i>
<i> scary at times.</i>

04:09.291 --> 04:12.834
<i> But I was determined</i>
<i> to never turn back.</i>

04:13.462 --> 04:16.088
<i> I'm real grateful</i>
<i> to the hardships</i>
<i> that I've overcome</i>

04:16.090 --> 04:18.382
<i> because they've</i>
<i> made me who I am.</i>

04:19.677 --> 04:22.552
<i> All of our hearts</i>
<i> are destined to be broken.</i>

04:24.014 --> 04:27.975
<i>It's what we do with the pieces</i>
<i> that make us extraordinary.</i>

04:29.228 --> 04:32.271

Make so noise. Yeah!

06:23.133 --> 06:27.052
- Yeah.
- What a way to open the show.

06:27.096 --> 06:30.222
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah, keep it going...

06:30.265 --> 06:32.015
I'm stumped already!

06:32.017 --> 06:34.267
...For the queen.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.353
Girl, you came out
fighting and swinging,

06:36.397 --> 06:38.271
and you got
the most gorgeous legs.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.024
- "hell-er!"
- jenny: "hello" is right.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.193
I'm just a bit stumped
right now, nick,

06:43.237 --> 06:45.195
because those vocals, I mean,

06:45.197 --> 06:46.321
I got goosebumps all over.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.157
Like, she had that edge,
that rock-- that edge to her.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.118
Robin: Absolutely.
She was down low
at the beginning.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.994
She had a powerful,
strong vibrato,

06:52.996 --> 06:55.122
and then she had
superior range up top.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.833
So I think this is just
the beginning of what
we're gonna see she can do.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.543
- Her range. That's right.
- She was like, "don't worry.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.002
I got more coming.
Don't you worry."

07:01.004 --> 07:03.130
okay! Okay?

07:03.173 --> 07:06.091
All right, panel,
get ready to squirm.

07:06.135 --> 07:08.343
Time for your
first impression guesses.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.428
- Oh.
- Ugh.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.390
And this time you only have
15 seconds to do so.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.810
- Oh, no. What?
- Because you guys always
be taking so long.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.145
Yeah, go ahead,
look up under your seats.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.521
You got alarm clocks
up under there.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.273
- Oh.
- They're under your chairs.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.525
- Oh, man.
- First impression guesses.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.236
Ready, set, go.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.029
- Oh, we do it?
- Yeah.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.156
<i> ♪ I'm gonna find you </i>

07:29.158 --> 07:30.574
I think I know who this is.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.575
<i> ♪ I'm gonna getcha,</i>
<i> getcha getcha getcha ♪</i>

07:31.869 --> 07:34.119
all right, who do you think
queen of hearts is?

07:34.163 --> 07:37.164
- Oh, this is hard.
- One way or another,

07:37.166 --> 07:39.207
you're probably gonna
get it wrong.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.083
How dare you?

07:40.377 --> 07:42.461
- But it's worth a shot.
- ( alarm rings )

07:42.504 --> 07:44.546
- 15 seconds are up.
- Wait, is that it?

07:44.590 --> 07:45.505
That's all we get?

07:45.757 --> 07:47.966
That's all you--
it's just 15 real seconds.

07:48.010 --> 07:48.758
( nicole sighs )

07:48.802 --> 07:49.926
are you guys not stumped?

07:50.262 --> 07:53.221
Tonight's about getting to know
our new batch of singers.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.515
So let's ask them a question.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.184
Why queen of hearts?

07:57.227 --> 08:01.354
Oh, I just feel like
the world's just so noisy,

08:01.398 --> 08:04.191
and so I'm here to be
a big ol' blaring,

08:04.234 --> 08:06.818
blasting megaphone of heart.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.195
- Oh.
- Wow.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.279
I love you!

08:09.573 --> 08:12.657
- Does that give you any clues?
- ( nicole groans )

08:12.701 --> 08:14.284
I'm so sorry.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.536
It's just,
I'm not for sure, nick,

08:16.580 --> 08:17.913
but if I'm going
off of the clues,

08:18.415 --> 08:21.291
they were talking
about that they've had
a troubled childhood, right.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.044
I heard the southern accent.
It's real thick.

08:24.046 --> 08:27.005
I'm all about freeing
britney right now, guys,

08:27.007 --> 08:30.091
so I'm thinking
it could be britney.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.135
And she has spiky spears.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.012
Nick:
That's a good guess.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.555
Well, you know, when I heard
that southern accent,

08:35.599 --> 08:39.017
I was thinking,
okay, this could be
some country singer.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.018
There's a lot out there.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.103
Kellie pickler, faith hill,

08:42.147 --> 08:44.189
there's carrie underwood.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.983
But then there was that rock
in that voice, too,

08:47.027 --> 08:49.319
and those beautiful
walking sticks.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.029
Those gams look familiar.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.198
This could possibly be fergie.

08:53.242 --> 08:56.284
- Ken: What?
Are you kidding me?
- No.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.912
I was kind of thinking that,
but fergie got
a distinct vibrato.

08:58.956 --> 09:02.123
Like, when she be singing,
she sound a little like
taylor dayne sometimes.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.416
She got that strong,
amazing voice.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.210
I heard some
of that vibrato though.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.254
- But she does have
fergie's legs.
- Jenny: She does!

09:07.297 --> 09:09.756
Is fergie friends
with "the next karate kid"?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.258
Hilary swank, you know?

09:11.301 --> 09:13.093
Do we really believe that?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.803
Hear me out, guys,

09:14.846 --> 09:16.429
because I know
exactly who this is.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.973
Oh, god.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.349
When I saw the tin man
in the clue,

09:19.351 --> 09:22.477
I'm thinking "wizard of oz,"
judy garland, dorothy.

09:22.521 --> 09:26.273
Could be renée zellweger
who has an amazing voice,

09:26.316 --> 09:28.692
- who is from the south...
- Yep. Yes.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.235
...Who is an oscar-winner.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.279
And as an oscar-winner myself,
oscar-winners...

09:32.322 --> 09:34.531
- Laugh louder.
- ...Hang out with
oscar-winners.

09:34.575 --> 09:38.493
Renée zellweger,
here's my eye on you!

09:38.495 --> 09:41.288
Ken, ken.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.998
You said--

09:43.041 --> 09:45.166
nicole:
You're an oscar-winner?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.043
You said you
were an oscar-winner.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.713
- Yeah.
- What'd you win an oscar for?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.590
I won an oscar
for shortest film.

09:51.633 --> 09:55.343
It's not researchable,
but I won an oscar
for best shortest film.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.513
- Look it up. Imdb.
- Well, one thing we do know,

09:58.557 --> 10:00.348
that was an amazing
performance, right?

10:00.392 --> 10:01.474
Yes!

wouldn't you say, robin?

20:39.155 --> 20:41.197
The vocals and the energy
that you gave,

20:41.241 --> 20:43.032
you were ad-libbing,
you made it your own.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.408
You didn't just stick
to the script.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.452
That was a very
confident performance.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.995
Thank you so much.
That was gorgeous.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.372
Nicole: Yeah.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.166
But I'm stumped right now, nick,

20:52.168 --> 20:53.542
because that voice was so rich,

20:53.586 --> 20:57.004
and I'm like,
"whose voice is that?"

20:57.048 --> 20:58.214
like, I feel like
I know that voice.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.424
You know what will help?
It's someone famous.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.261
Big time.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.597
All right, guys, time for them
first impression guesses.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.840
Oh, no!

21:07.850 --> 21:10.601
Ready, set, go.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.062
<i> ♪ one way or another </i>

21:13.106 --> 21:17.066
- <i> ♪ I'm gonna find ya  </i>
- just who is cupcake?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.151
Write your guesses down, guys.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.320
How do you spell "victory?"
because I'm gonna win.

21:21.364 --> 21:24.073
I have three more
seconds to dance. Yeah.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.700
- Oh, look at that.
- All right, I'm done.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.119
- Yoink!
- Can we go? Is that it?

21:28.162 --> 21:31.289
Time's up, panel!
Drop it in the clock.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.415
Y'all don't wanna see
what's in here.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.499
You just don't
wanna see what's in here.

21:34.752 --> 21:40.256
After that amazing performance,
cupcake, how are you feeling?

21:40.300 --> 21:44.051
Well, I was supposed to be here
with some other sweet things,

21:44.095 --> 21:46.387
but now I'm all alone.

21:46.431 --> 21:52.393
So she was in a group?
Or her family or her kids?

21:52.395 --> 21:55.688
You know, at first kind of
got a whoopi goldberg,

21:55.732 --> 21:58.190
kind of a growly
kind of voice.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.401
But then I was like,
"no, I don't think it's her."

22:00.403 --> 22:03.321
and then I thought
maybe tracy chapman,
you know what I mean?

22:03.364 --> 22:05.189
That kind of--
ooh, ken likes that one.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.532
- I love tracy chapman.
- Robin: Love tracy chapman.

22:06.576 --> 22:09.618
But I'm gonna just throw
a major curveball, okay?

22:09.620 --> 22:12.455
And you guys can boo me
like ken. It's okay.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.623
- Why are you...
- But based off of those legs,

22:14.667 --> 22:16.459
and where those kneecaps are,

22:16.502 --> 22:19.086
I'm thinking this could be
someone like a rupaul.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.214
- Interesting.
- That's a great guess.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.883
Nick: They didn't boo.
They said, "ah!"

22:23.885 --> 22:24.925
robin: I'm gonna
double down on that,

22:25.219 --> 22:27.094
because at first,
I'm thinking the group thing.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.387
I'm thinking,
is it jennifer holliday,

22:28.431 --> 22:30.389
known for singing
in "dreamgirls"?

22:30.433 --> 22:32.016
But then I started
listening to the voice,

22:32.060 --> 22:33.351
and there was a familiarity,

22:33.394 --> 22:35.436
and I was thinking that
it might be rupaul also.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.230
- I'm gonna double down
on rupaul.
- Both: Dang.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.608
- Okay.
- Nick: That would be
interesting. Nicole?

22:40.610 --> 22:42.193
( groans )

22:42.236 --> 22:43.444
you tripling down on that?

22:43.488 --> 22:47.448
No, I'm not. I'm going
the opposite direction.

22:47.492 --> 22:51.369
- So I'm getting, like,
legend vibes, right?
- Indeed.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.412
And I'm at two minds about
myself right now, nick.

22:53.456 --> 22:58.250
- Usually she has one.
- I'm thinking it could be...

22:58.294 --> 23:00.127
- Who? Who?
- The legendary...

23:00.129 --> 23:02.630
"the closer I get to you,"
roberta flack.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.548
- Okay.
- Oh!

23:04.550 --> 23:10.137
Or who is that lady who hosts
that grocery shopping show?

23:10.139 --> 23:11.639
Ken: Oh, my god. Stop.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.307
Who is the lady who hosts
the shopping show?

23:13.351 --> 23:14.809
- Oh, oh! Leslie jones.
- You talking about leslie?

23:15.228 --> 23:18.562
Is it leslie jones?
She's tall, she's gorgeous,
she's "hil-arr-ious."

23:18.564 --> 23:21.399
so you went from roberta flack
to leslie jones?

23:21.401 --> 23:24.819
- Yes! I know.
- She's not a singer
like roberta flack.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.570
- Leslie's a friend of mine,
but she's not a singer.
- She is tall though.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.322
Ken: Yes, she is tall.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.490
She is tall,
that's the reason--
I don't know.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.450
Ken: She definitely
has the presence,

23:31.452 --> 23:33.285
but maybe it's just because
I want her to be,

23:33.287 --> 23:35.371
and so I'm getting
all the clues together

23:35.415 --> 23:39.333
like love, hearts,
"what's love got to do with it?"

23:39.368 --> 23:42.128
maybe it's my personal
family friend

23:42.171 --> 23:44.171
and costco plus one member--

23:44.215 --> 23:47.758
tina turner is in the house.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.219
- Can I get an amen?
- Boo!

23:50.263 --> 23:53.264
I've never seen an audience
look so angry before, ken.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.434
- They're like, "no!"
- you know what?

23:56.477 --> 24:00.604
Anyone who's been
to any of my comedy shows,
you get used to it.

24:00.648 --> 24:04.775
Nick: Well, one thing
we can all agree on--
this performance.

24:04.819 --> 24:09.113
Delicious job, y'all.
Give it up for cupcake.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.906
Now head on backstage, cupcake.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.410
- I think we wanna go
the other way, cupcake.
- Uh-oh.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.288
We gonna go here.
There we go.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.666
You guys, group b
I think is crushing it.

24:20.710 --> 24:25.337
- Group b did not
come to play, right?
- Absolutely.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.766

- Whoo!

24:37.768 --> 24:40.394
I'm told our next singer
is so good,

24:40.438 --> 24:43.022
he's gonna make tonight
a real dogfight.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.372
- Okay, he's an athlete.
- I love it!

25:00.416 --> 25:03.250
I mean, it's nick's double.
They're the same height.

25:03.294 --> 25:06.754
And he's hitting me
with his tail.
What is going on here?

25:06.797 --> 25:09.548
I get a feeling
I know this person.
I don't know why.

25:09.592 --> 25:12.384
- Already?
- Any time a dog hits you
with its tail,

25:12.428 --> 25:13.719
it must be familiar.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.353

27:50.795 --> 27:52.211
Dalmatian in the house.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.088
Ken: This is tough.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.383
Oh, my gosh.
Who is that?

27:57.426 --> 27:59.677
That's what I'm talking about!

27:59.679 --> 28:02.429
- ( imitates barking )
- nick: I definitely
know who this is.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.431
I'ma just take it
like that, so--

28:04.475 --> 28:06.392
god, nick, I'm really glad
you're not a judge,

28:06.435 --> 28:08.560
'cause I'd never win
the golden ear.

28:08.562 --> 28:12.815
Whoever he is, he's got it.
Like, he was working the stage.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.442
Ain't nothing like-- but
a little chicken wing up there,

28:15.486 --> 28:17.319
then you threw
the little football,
and then you came back,

28:17.363 --> 28:19.446
and then he was singing
at the end, too.

28:19.490 --> 28:24.368
- That was amazing.
- All right, panel, who is
this mystery dalmatian?

28:24.412 --> 28:27.204
It's time for
your first impression guesses.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.289
- Oh, not this again.
- Oh, man.

28:29.333 --> 28:35.003
Ready, set, go.
Who is the dalmatian?

28:35.005 --> 28:37.256
Okay, I'm just saying,
first impression,

28:37.299 --> 28:39.174
I'm not saying
mariah carey, but--

28:39.218 --> 28:40.342
it's definitely
not mariah carey.

28:40.636 --> 28:45.097
- Ken: Yep.
- Write your guesses down.
Time's up!

28:45.141 --> 28:47.558
Worst guess I've ever done.

28:47.601 --> 28:51.603
All right, dalmatian,
why'd you pick
a dalmatian costume?

28:53.149 --> 28:56.150
I always feel
like I'm the underdog,

28:56.193 --> 28:58.569
and tonight
is gonna be a dogfight.

28:58.612 --> 29:03.157
So I had to go
with my favorite dog,
the dalmatian.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.702
Nick: Okay, and he gave
you guys some clues.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.287
You guys picking up on anything?

29:08.330 --> 29:09.621
Robin: You know,
I'm gonna throw it out there.

29:09.665 --> 29:12.458
One of the best performers
in hip-hop ever,

29:12.501 --> 29:17.713
I think it is the athlete
and the rapper nelly.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.716
That's a good one.
Look at the audience.
They agreeing with you.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.342
- That's a good guess.
- Thank you.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.471
- Jenny, is that who it is?
- Such a good guess.

29:25.473 --> 29:28.474
It could be,

29:28.517 --> 29:31.143
but for some reason
the way he ran out

29:31.187 --> 29:33.020
and was he buddy-buddy
with you,

29:33.063 --> 29:35.063
I thought maybe
it was kevin hart.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.265
He'd be this big.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.027
He'd be, like,
a shih tzu or a poodle.

29:40.070 --> 29:43.238
Whoa, whoa.
Leave the short out of this.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.824
Then I thought
maybe an athlete.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.284
Damian lillard,
'cause he's little.

29:47.286 --> 29:51.163
And then, you know,
not to brag about my imdb,

29:51.165 --> 29:54.458
but I did see the painting,
"scream,"

29:54.460 --> 29:56.460
and I was in "scream"
and "scary movie."

29:56.504 --> 29:58.587
- that's right. Good movie.
- Thank you.

29:58.631 --> 30:01.381
And katt williams
was in "scary movie."

30:01.425 --> 30:03.801
- oh.
- And there was a cat
in the video.

30:03.844 --> 30:08.096
- Katt can rap
and sing as well, too.
- Katt can do everything.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.224
Man, this is--
I'm really, really stumped

30:10.267 --> 30:12.392
because your
performance was so good,
not what I expected.

30:12.436 --> 30:15.187
But this could be
a reverse 52 fake out.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.481
These are, like,
new orleans saints colors.

30:17.525 --> 30:20.275
And then I saw usc colors,
like, red and yellow,

30:20.277 --> 30:22.152
and I was thinking reggie bush.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.238
I grew up in the same
neighborhood with reggie bush.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.156
- Good guess.
- It's a good guess.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.284
I'm accidentally right!
Thank you!

30:29.286 --> 30:30.661
I think it's a great guess.
Great guess.

- That's a rapper.

Ken, talk to the banana split.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.265
What makes
the show special is--

35:02.309 --> 35:03.975
yeah, it's just
performances like that,

35:04.019 --> 35:04.935
more than anything we do.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.145
And it's kind of what
we all need right now.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.231
It's just perfect.
Amazing. So good.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.400
Clearly what this show
is all about.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.028
All right, everybody
take out your clocks.

35:15.072 --> 35:18.031
It's time for your

35:37.886 --> 35:40.387
time's up. All right.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.389
Clearly, we see
they have personality.

35:42.432 --> 35:46.351
So the obvious question is
have you worked together before?

35:46.395 --> 35:49.813
Well, we don't work together
all the time,

35:49.815 --> 35:53.066
but I think
when we have worked together

35:53.068 --> 35:55.110
in the past,
we've worked really well.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.529
Well, actually,
banana's good by itself.

35:57.573 --> 36:01.616
Oh. Oh, okay. Okay!

36:01.660 --> 36:06.371
- Banana is good by itself.
- Are they a divorce sundae?

36:06.415 --> 36:10.250
Whoa, you went
personal and dark.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.712
Jenny: Seriously!

36:13.755 --> 36:15.422
It's, like, I don't know,
j. Lo and marc anthony

36:15.465 --> 36:17.424
or gwyneth paltrow
and chris martin.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.300
Nicole:
That's not bad, jenny.

36:18.552 --> 36:19.551
Jenny: You know who else
this could be?

36:20.137 --> 36:22.679
She has a beautiful voice and
he knows how to play the piano.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.807
Could it be katharine mcphee
and david foster?

36:25.809 --> 36:29.936
Katharine is
a little bit more reserved--
when I've worked with her.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.105
Maybe because around me
she's shy, you know,
around my brilliance.

36:32.149 --> 36:35.108
- Or you creeped her out.
- Or, you know--

36:35.152 --> 36:38.320
a little bit of both.
How dare you, daddy?

36:38.322 --> 36:40.697
Robin:
My father and david foster
were best buddies,

36:40.741 --> 36:43.950
so I grew up with david
as almost my uncle figure.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.161
- Canadian.
- I didn't even think of them.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.871
But somebody who does
have that voice

36:47.915 --> 36:50.373
and an incredibly talented
musical partner

36:50.417 --> 36:52.125
would be faith hill
and tim mcgraw.

36:52.169 --> 36:55.337
- Ooh, that's good.
That's good.
- Nicole: Dang.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.006
Nick: Nicole, what you got?

36:58.050 --> 36:59.883
If I'm going off
of collaborator, right?

36:59.885 --> 37:04.304
- Yep.
- I'm thinking this could be
emma stone and ryan gosling.

37:04.348 --> 37:05.972
Ken:
That's a good guess.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.892
Nicole: Let me tell you,
emma stone can sang.

37:08.936 --> 37:11.228
- She has an amazing voice.
- Yes.

37:11.230 --> 37:14.022
- Not a bad guess.
Not a bad guess.
- Jenny: Right?

37:14.024 --> 37:17.651
Well, whoever you are,
I hope you are here
every single week,

37:17.694 --> 37:20.153
because I need to hear
you guys again and again.

37:20.197 --> 37:22.864
- By far my favorite.
- Nick: Indeed.

37:22.908 --> 37:27.410
- I loved it!
- Wow. Give it up
for banana split.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.247
That was outstanding.

of impressive singers,

37:41.009 --> 37:44.469
but sadly,
someone's gotta go home.

37:44.513 --> 37:49.057
Panel, audience, and our
super fans all across america,

37:49.101 --> 37:50.558

37:52.271 --> 37:54.604

37:59.861 --> 38:02.529

38:29.933 --> 38:32.383
We'll be seeing you
in the next round.

38:32.394 --> 38:37.939
Rest up, because
you will be faced with
your first wild card.

38:38.442 --> 38:39.232
Boy, oh, boy,

38:39.484 --> 38:41.484

38:41.528 --> 38:42.819
I hate to see you go,

38:43.196 --> 38:47.240
but I'm so happy to show
the rest of the world
who you actually are.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.909
But first, men in black,

38:49.953 --> 38:53.413
retrieve the panel's
first impression guesses.

38:53.457 --> 38:55.290
Ken: Oh.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.292
Oh, no.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.794
All right. Here we go.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.254
Let's do this.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.006
We're gonna see
who they think you are.

39:03.008 --> 39:09.304
Mr. Thicke,
your first impression guess
was nelly, our friend.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.513
- Yes.
- Are you sticking with that?

39:10.891 --> 39:13.975
Based on the body language,
the way he's acting with nick,

39:14.019 --> 39:16.394
I'm sticking with nelly.
Let's go.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.897
All right. Nicole.

39:18.940 --> 39:22.108
You believed that dalmatian

39:22.152 --> 39:24.027
was "one of the lil's."

39:24.071 --> 39:26.529
yes, I...

39:26.531 --> 39:28.615
Did she legit write
"one of the lil's"?

39:28.658 --> 39:32.243
- "one of the lil's."
- and it could be, you know?

39:32.287 --> 39:35.121
It could be lil yachty,

39:35.165 --> 39:38.041
lil uzi vert, lil boosie.

39:38.085 --> 39:40.919
That is a wide net, nicole.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.213
But you know what, guys?

39:43.256 --> 39:46.716
That's a superstar rapper,
so I agree with robin.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.386
I'm gonna go with nelly as well.

39:49.429 --> 39:53.056
- Jenny mccarthy-wahlberg.
- Oh, no.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.682
I'll be right here.

39:54.684 --> 39:58.395
Your first impression guess
was steve harvey.

39:59.815 --> 40:02.565
- What?
- Robin: That's it. I'm out.

40:02.567 --> 40:03.983
I got my stuff.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.986
Thanks, everyone.

40:07.030 --> 40:07.904
Good show, guys. Good show.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.697
- Steve harvey?
- Good show.

40:09.741 --> 40:13.827
Come on! He was funny
and your friends with everybody.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.870
You must not
be sticking with that.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.163
You must have been
under pressure with the clock.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.374
Okay, I'm not gonna
stick with it

40:19.418 --> 40:21.042
since you all made fun of me.

40:21.086 --> 40:24.254
But, you know, when I saw
"the scream" painting,

40:24.297 --> 40:26.256
it had me thinking of someone

40:26.299 --> 40:28.091
that was in
"scary movie" or "scream."

40:28.135 --> 40:31.970
and kevin hart
was in "scary movie 4."

40:32.013 --> 40:34.222
he could be wearing
elevator paws.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.182
Ken, for once, you don't
have the worst guess.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.601
Oh, thank you, daddy. Aww.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.688
Ken, your first
impression guess
was reggie bush.

40:41.731 --> 40:45.191
- Good guess, good guess.
- It's a good try. Thank you.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.403
Honest, I saw the red and yellow
in the clues-- usc.

40:48.447 --> 40:50.947
His costume is black and gold--
new orleans saints.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.991
The clues are
all about the pigskin.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.368
So I'm going with reggie bush.
Yeah, I think it is.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.954
- All right.
- Hope so. Hope so.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.289
Sticking with his reggie bush.

40:59.332 --> 41:02.917
Okay, panel, you have
made your final guesses.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.044
So let's see

41:05.088 --> 41:07.881
