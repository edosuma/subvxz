14:10.184 --> 14:11.621
- No, that's not gonna work.

14:11.657 --> 14:13.391
You have to ask me.

14:13.427 --> 14:14.894
Ask me proper.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.490
And tell me why you ain't
gonna leave me nowhere.

14:16.525 --> 14:18.564

first time inside me,

14:18.599 --> 14:19.763
you ain't gonna have no control.

14:19.798 --> 14:20.929
But what about the 10th time

14:20.964 --> 14:22.196
when you have plenty of control?

14:22.232 --> 14:23.429

not gonna leave me

14:25.472 --> 14:26.732

I made every decision in my
life based on logic and reason.

14:29.811 --> 14:32.705
I took my time, weighing
out the pros and cons.

14:32.740 --> 14:36.315
I had a ton of dreams but I
ain't never chased a single one.

14:36.351 --> 14:37.313
Maybe I'm due.

that crazy chase.

27:38.166 --> 27:40.029
'Cause I gotta know.

27:41.566 --> 27:44.097
- I swear to God, it was, Frank.

27:44.132 --> 27:47.901
I ain't never had anyone
do this for me before.

27:47.937 --> 27:50.774
I never felt this
way in my life.

27:50.809 --> 27:53.506
- And that part about
ridin', and dyin'?

27:53.541 --> 27:54.373
- Yeah.

27:56.044 --> 27:59.251
- Then we're stuck
together, baby.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.116
Hot gum on tarmac stuck.

28:02.917 --> 28:05.189
Ain't never coming apart.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.121
- Oh Frank.

28:09.893 --> 28:15.097
♪ I was dancing
when I was eight ♪

28:16.095 --> 28:18.631
♪ Is it strange to dance ♪

29:11.025 --> 29:11.857
- Ma'am.

29:12.722 --> 29:15.053
I, I know you scared.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.159
Hell, hell I would be, too.

29:17.194 --> 29:19.796
You know, but, but, but
ifin you popped the trunk,

29:19.831 --> 29:22.033
I, I could change
that tire and you,

29:22.068 --> 29:27.202
you could stay seated up in
there nice and, nice and safe.

29:28.038 --> 29:31.038
- I, I checked the trunk
and there's no spare.

29:31.073 --> 29:34.475
And I'm just really
scared of you.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.342
- Well uh,

29:37.250 --> 29:38.081
God bless.

29:46.555 --> 29:47.387
- Sorry.

30:31.932 --> 30:33.433
- Yeah, you right.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.603
There's no spare.

30:36.638 --> 30:41.606
I could uh, tow you
into Quicksilver,
about four miles up.

30:42.850 --> 30:43.910
We, we could probably
get you rolling again

30:43.945 --> 30:45.951
by tomorrow afternoon.

30:53.127 --> 30:53.719
- Yeah.

30:53.754 --> 30:54.553
- Okay.

30:56.494 --> 30:57.292
All right.

31:05.035 --> 31:08.571
You gotta get in
the driver's side.

31:08.606 --> 31:10.539
Well, slide on in.

31:32.463 --> 31:33.328
- Yeah.

31:34.502 --> 31:37.032
Yeah I got one coming in.

31:37.068 --> 31:39.370
- Um, do you think
maybe that I can use it?

31:39.405 --> 31:40.401
- Oh, sorry.

31:41.507 --> 31:43.206
Business use only.

31:50.876 --> 31:55.084
You know that, that rolled up
glass wouldn't protect you,

31:55.119 --> 31:58.518
if, if someone really
wanted some of you.

31:59.687 --> 32:04.158
And, and I, I can think of
plenty of romantic things that,

32:04.194 --> 32:07.060
that some fellows would
want to do to you.

32:07.095 --> 32:09.661
Hell, just over and over again.

32:11.938 --> 32:15.667
And you, and you all
the way out here, alone.

32:20.210 --> 32:24.645
But, but they sinners,
and I, I know that.

32:24.681 --> 32:25.851
You know?

32:25.886 --> 32:28.350
And, and, and, and
running away from sin

32:28.386 --> 32:33.190
is what keep me focused
solely on, on that flat tire.

32:34.756 --> 32:35.588
I mean,

32:38.158 --> 32:40.131
unless you wanted it.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.366
'Cause Chisos says that,

32:45.402 --> 32:49.404
that, that little want
makes all the difference.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.142
He says that that, that want,

32:54.177 --> 32:57.280
is what bring the
carn, the carnal,

32:59.053 --> 33:03.418
into the cathedral and the,
the hole into the holy.

33:23.075 --> 33:26.474
I, I was just, I was
just talking is all.

33:27.848 --> 33:30.610
I, I, I don't mean
nothing by it.

33:44.631 --> 33:45.826
- Baby, baby, baby.

33:45.861 --> 33:47.563
- Hm, what?

33:47.598 --> 33:48.400
- Fuck.

33:48.435 --> 33:49.496
Fuck, okay.

33:49.531 --> 33:52.231
Okay, put the money
away, put the money away.

33:52.267 --> 33:54.199
Where's the gun,
where's the gun?

33:54.235 --> 33:55.301
Hurry up.
- It's okay.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.770
- Hurry up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.142
- It's gonna be okay.

34:02.177 --> 34:04.743
I, I'll just talk to him, baby.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.258
- Beautiful.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.763
Say hello to sin for me.

34:27.004 --> 34:29.174
I love this time of the year.

34:29.209 --> 34:33.073
Classics all over the blacktop,
all going at the show.

34:33.109 --> 34:34.577
Y'all showing or selling?

34:34.612 --> 34:35.841
- Both.

34:35.876 --> 34:38.445
Who knows, you might even
pull us over on the way back,

34:38.480 --> 34:40.414
driving in something
even sweeter than this

34:40.450 --> 34:43.588
if I see something that
makes my thighs twitch.

34:45.457 --> 34:50.222
- I don't know, sweetie, it's
hard to beat a 68 B, but uh,

34:50.257 --> 34:52.296
damn, likes cars, too.

34:54.033 --> 34:56.163
Got yourself a good
one there, son.

34:56.198 --> 34:58.063
- Please, he ain't got shit.

34:58.099 --> 34:59.164
He's my brother.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.097
- Oh, is that right?

35:00.132 --> 35:01.538
- Mm-hm.

35:01.573 --> 35:02.405
- Well.

35:04.305 --> 35:06.038
So what you got under there?

35:06.073 --> 35:07.278
- Underwear.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.814
Just kiddin'.

35:09.849 --> 35:13.244
It's a V8, fuckin' big one, too.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.714
- I'll bet it is.

35:17.518 --> 35:19.252
So what, you gonna
keep it a secret?

35:19.287 --> 35:21.387
- Well, you know what they say,

35:21.423 --> 35:22.753
it's the secret
that's never told

35:22.788 --> 35:26.797
that offers the most
extraordinary suspense.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.060
- Yeah, that's a good one.

35:28.096 --> 35:29.298
Who said that?

35:29.333 --> 35:30.263
- Tell him it's from
Big Daddy Don Garlic.

35:30.298 --> 35:32.569
- Fucking Big Daddy Dan Garlic.

35:32.604 --> 35:33.397
- Don.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.233
- That's what I meant.

35:34.268 --> 35:35.202
- It's Garlets.
- Don.

35:35.237 --> 35:36.573
- And I believe his last was-

35:36.609 --> 35:37.703
- Garlets.

35:37.772 --> 35:40.612
- Oh yeah, he was a hell
of mopar driver, wasn't he?

35:40.648 --> 35:41.573
- Sure as hell was.

35:41.675 --> 35:43.507
Hell, I love the way
he drove them mopers.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.881
He fuckin' owns 'em, he does.

35:45.916 --> 35:47.582
- Hey, look honey,

35:48.685 --> 35:53.022
you got anything you wanna
show off on the way back in,

35:53.057 --> 35:55.292
you just gimme a holler, hear?

35:55.328 --> 35:59.528
- Well you better keep
your ears on, good buddy.

36:00.933 --> 36:02.264
- Well, anyway,

36:02.299 --> 36:04.235
the real reason I
pulled y'all over

36:04.271 --> 36:06.804
is you're about to hit a
stretch of about 30 miles

36:06.840 --> 36:08.337
with no cell phone towers,

36:08.372 --> 36:11.406
and no gas for another
40 miles after that.

36:11.441 --> 36:14.445
You may wanna keep a
close eye on that gauge.

36:14.480 --> 36:18.509
I mean, you can get gas in
Quicksilver about 12 miles in,

36:18.544 --> 36:21.448
but get in and get outta there.

36:21.484 --> 36:23.552
Mercury got in the
water from that mine

36:23.588 --> 36:27.088
and left them Appalachian
transplants bat shit crazy.

36:27.123 --> 36:29.327
What's left 'em, anyway.

36:30.358 --> 36:32.957
Well, I don't wanna keep y'all.

36:37.170 --> 36:39.067
Hey, you ever let
her drive that thing?

36:39.102 --> 36:40.599
- Every once in a while.

36:40.634 --> 36:43.204
- 'Cause I would
love to see a beauty

36:43.239 --> 36:44.675
behind the wheel of the beauty.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.544
What was that?

36:46.580 --> 36:47.945
- Cricket.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.243
Damn things been caught in here

36:49.278 --> 36:51.515
since we got gas in Marathon.

36:51.550 --> 36:53.817
And yeah, I only let him drive
when I need to take a nap.

36:53.853 --> 36:55.650
Let's switch, Tommy.

37:02.494 --> 37:06.226
- If y'all wanna smoke 'em
up on the way outta here,

37:06.261 --> 37:07.891
ain't nobody looking.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.597
You won't see no berries
and cherries from me.

37:10.633 --> 37:14.900
- Well, I'm a give you a
front row seat, law man.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.030
- Well, this is it.

37:43.066 --> 37:44.595
It, it's humble.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.001
But rooms are clean though.

37:47.037 --> 37:48.505
I, I make sure.

37:49.473 --> 37:52.608
The, the office is
there on the right.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.505
- Hi daddy, it's Molly.

38:55.572 --> 38:59.070
Um, I'm calling from
a motel phone 'cause,

39:00.247 --> 39:03.613
'cause I'm on that
dead spot on the 16.

39:04.614 --> 39:07.881
And I know, I'm sorry,
but, but listen.

39:11.620 --> 39:13.858
- Women
I would like you.

39:13.894 --> 39:15.926
Too bad I like guys.

39:15.962 --> 39:18.059
Like you.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.528
- All right.

39:19.563 --> 39:21.425
Find out a lot more
about you than I like.

39:21.461 --> 39:22.797
- I told you...

39:24.435 --> 39:25.630
- Anyway, I hope
you get this soon

39:25.665 --> 39:27.804
so you can come and get me.

39:27.839 --> 39:28.803
Yeah.

39:30.974 --> 39:31.836
Okay.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.941
Hopefully I see
you in the morning.

39:36.447 --> 39:37.812
I love you, daddy.

39:37.847 --> 39:42.553
- Didn't recall you asking
to use any extra services.

39:43.616 --> 39:45.589
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

39:46.356 --> 39:48.424
I just had to make a quick call.

39:48.459 --> 39:51.760
Um, you can add it
to my bill though.

39:53.698 --> 39:57.969
- It was up to me, I, I
wouldn't charge you at all.

39:58.005 --> 39:59.867
Well, five's my favorite.

40:00.801 --> 40:04.501
Just always it's
always smells good.

40:04.537 --> 40:06.109
Don't know why.

40:06.144 --> 40:07.846
- Need a witness, Cleve.

40:07.881 --> 40:09.212
Oh, oh I'm sorry.

40:09.248 --> 40:10.612
I didn't realize
you had company.

40:10.647 --> 40:13.813
- Oh no, no, we, we
was just finishing up.

40:13.848 --> 40:17.118
Oh there, there's free
drinks in the bar later.

40:17.153 --> 40:18.485
- Oh thanks.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.020
I'm, I'm just so tired though.

40:29.369 --> 40:32.867
- Surprised you didn't
rip your britches.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.811
- Shut your damn mouth.

Appalachian weirdo.

41:25.990 --> 41:26.992
Baby.

41:27.027 --> 41:28.857
- Well hello, you two.

41:29.825 --> 41:30.989
Pardon, but I always
put my hands together

41:31.024 --> 41:34.764
in the time of need,
and low and behold.

41:35.828 --> 41:37.762
Seems we like the same vintage,

41:37.797 --> 41:40.198
just from a different branch.

41:41.635 --> 41:43.839
Stopped, don't know why.

41:44.806 --> 41:46.076
Think you too could
give me a ride?

41:46.111 --> 41:46.974
- Yes.
- No.

41:48.575 --> 41:49.840
Can't help you.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.076
But this is a friend of mine.

41:52.112 --> 41:55.950
And if you give him a
call, I'm sure he can.

41:57.188 --> 41:58.989
- I'll make due.

41:59.025 --> 42:00.086
- Suit yourself.

42:24.483 --> 42:26.645
- Sorry I had to
step out, Ophelia.

42:26.680 --> 42:27.713
We have a leaky faucet.

42:27.748 --> 42:29.880
I had to put maintenance on it.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.419
So you were saying that uh,

42:31.454 --> 42:32.622
you left your husband

42:32.657 --> 42:34.122
when you met this
fella at a conference?

42:34.157 --> 42:35.185
- I did.

42:35.221 --> 42:38.889
Within the hour, I was
in a car with him and,

42:38.924 --> 42:40.760
and we were leaving everything

42:40.796 --> 42:43.833
that I forgot was
important to me.

42:46.833 --> 42:49.003
David was six when I left.

42:51.874 --> 42:56.747
And, little
Laurie was three.

42:58.047 --> 43:03.052
I haven't seen or spoke
to my babies in 37 years.

43:03.088 --> 43:04.018
37 years.

43:05.852 --> 43:08.220
- Does it serve you right?

43:11.330 --> 43:13.632
- I suppose it does.
- Hm.

43:14.965 --> 43:19.204
I saw you listed on the
register as an Ophelia Wendall.

43:19.239 --> 43:20.835
Is that your maiden or his?

43:20.871 --> 43:22.099
- Oh no, I never wanted
to change my last name.

43:22.135 --> 43:23.868
- You know, it don't
really seem right

43:23.903 --> 43:25.243
sharing names with little ones

43:25.278 --> 43:27.905
when you only donated the nature

43:27.940 --> 43:30.649
and ran away from the nurture.

43:32.277 --> 43:35.650
Hope you got your heart
right with the Lord.

43:35.686 --> 43:36.917
- I think I'll
take my check now.

43:36.952 --> 43:39.884
- No, no, there's no
check for the truth.

43:39.919 --> 43:42.254
You told it fair and square.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.360
- Have a nice day.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.935
- Well it's settled.

43:55.971 --> 43:59.106
You don't hold no
truck with adultery.

44:00.375 --> 44:01.207
What?

44:04.148 --> 44:05.079
What?

44:07.152 --> 44:07.983
- Nothing.

44:09.948 --> 44:12.487
You got Chisos pegged.

44:12.522 --> 44:13.690
Hell, if he was here, I,

44:13.725 --> 44:16.253
I reckon lightning
come down from heaven,

44:16.288 --> 44:19.060
strike that adulterer
dead on the spot.

44:19.095 --> 44:22.596
- You know damn well the
Lord don't work like that.

44:22.631 --> 44:24.362
We gotta do his will.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.170
- Well, I'll go tell Cookie now.

44:28.205 --> 44:29.103
- Yeah.

44:42.983 --> 44:48.188

45:03.402 --> 45:08.340

45:25.596 --> 45:27.695

Excuse there.

Can, can I help you?

45:35.573 --> 45:36.771
- Just looking for a room.

45:36.807 --> 45:38.906
- Honeymoon suite
if you got one.

45:38.941 --> 45:41.472
- Yeah, if you got
it, and a fill up.

45:41.507 --> 45:44.574
- You, you, you two ain't

45:44.610 --> 45:48.184
'Cause uh, 'cause we don't
keep with no drug addicts here.

45:48.219 --> 45:49.320
- No.

45:49.356 --> 45:50.984
No sir, none of the above.

45:51.019 --> 45:53.255
- Nope, definitely
not drug dicks.

45:53.290 --> 45:54.188
- Yeah.

45:55.260 --> 45:56.623
Okay then.

46:03.766 --> 46:06.066
fitting for a, a new union.

46:06.102 --> 46:10.039
All right, if uh, y'all
could just sign in here.

46:10.074 --> 46:14.505
Now we have a, a king with
a flower back headboard.

46:15.513 --> 46:17.277
That's uh, uh 40 per.

46:19.119 --> 46:19.776
That okay?

46:19.811 --> 46:20.613
- Mm-hm.

46:20.648 --> 46:21.850
- Oh no, no.

46:21.885 --> 46:22.782
We, we'll settle
up in the morning,

46:22.817 --> 46:24.922
if, if y'all gonna eat.

46:27.019 --> 46:29.223
- Damn, she's beautiful.

46:30.263 --> 46:31.560
- What's that?

46:31.596 --> 46:34.463
Oh uh, yeah, they all are.

46:34.499 --> 46:36.230
- Who'd a hung her?

46:37.536 --> 46:40.234
- She took the bite, didn't she?

46:41.135 --> 46:44.536
- We'll take the
flower back, please.

46:44.571 --> 46:48.472
- Now there's uh, there's
drinks in the bar after dark.

46:48.508 --> 46:53.283
If y'all sit with Mabel,
just, just give her this.

46:53.319 --> 46:54.444
- Who's Mabel?

46:54.479 --> 46:58.415
- Oh, Maybelline, she,
she's my, she's my wife.

46:58.450 --> 47:02.055
She, she runs the, the
bar and the, the diner.

47:02.091 --> 47:05.123
It gets kind of lonely
out here, so uh,

47:05.159 --> 47:07.398
so ifin y'all got
a story to tell,

47:07.434 --> 47:09.894
she'll be happy to listen.

47:09.930 --> 47:11.367
First two are free.

47:11.403 --> 47:12.963
What's TOT mean?

47:12.998 --> 47:14.771
- Table of truth.

47:14.806 --> 47:17.468
And uh, she'll know
if you're lying.

47:17.504 --> 47:20.278
- We can't miss out on
an opportunity like that,

47:20.313 --> 47:21.506
now can we, baby?

47:30.456 --> 47:32.217
- Did they move the car?

47:32.252 --> 47:33.653
- It's right in
front of the room.

47:37.358 --> 47:39.794
- I got it all topped
off and ready for you.

47:39.829 --> 47:41.996
Parked it in front of your room.

47:42.031 --> 47:45.366
Even washed the
windshield for you.

47:45.401 --> 47:48.271
- Hey, you mind if I freshen
up and meet you at the bar?

47:48.306 --> 47:49.138
- Okay.

47:51.144 --> 47:52.343
Hey.

47:52.378 --> 47:54.077
- Yeah?

47:55.078 --> 47:56.877
- Can I swat you on the
ass as you walk away?

47:56.912 --> 47:59.412
I, I always wanted to do that.

48:02.181 --> 48:04.681
- You don't have to ask, baby.

48:07.591 --> 48:08.960
Just swing it.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.855
- I'm sorry about this,

49:10.890 --> 49:13.887
But you shouldn't have
done what you done.

49:13.923 --> 49:16.291
Don't worry, we'll fix ya.

49:17.597 --> 49:19.624
Right after I fix this one.

50:02.741 --> 50:04.273
I think that girl heard me.

50:04.308 --> 50:06.042
And, and then she was, she
was staring right at me.

50:06.077 --> 50:08.179
- And what would she
have heard, Cookie?

50:08.214 --> 50:12.116
The sound of a wrinkly old lady
being strung up by her foot?

50:12.151 --> 50:13.712
She couldn't even name that
tune with all the notes.

50:13.747 --> 50:15.578
- You didn't tell me there was
somebody in the corner room.

50:15.613 --> 50:17.621
- Well, I just
checked her in today.

50:17.657 --> 50:18.548
- But you didn't tell me.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.353
There wasn't supposed
to be nobody.

50:20.388 --> 50:23.191
I wouldn't have been
carrying that lady's,

50:23.226 --> 50:24.356
I mean, if I knew that
there was somebody

50:24.392 --> 50:25.529
I wouldn't have been
carrying the leg.

50:25.565 --> 50:27.131
- Okay, okay, okay.

50:27.831 --> 50:29.562
I'll go check on her.

50:35.805 --> 50:37.207
- Miss?

50:39.041 --> 50:41.475
You, you, you okay in there?

50:42.680 --> 50:43.774
- Yep, all good.

50:47.420 --> 50:48.317
- Oh, okay.

50:49.956 --> 50:52.648
Well, you know, I
was, I was just uh,

50:52.684 --> 50:55.619
I was just checking
on you 'cause um,

50:55.654 --> 50:58.822
'cause, 'cause you ain't
take no dinner and,

50:58.858 --> 51:01.624
and hell you, you ain't poked
your head out all night.

51:01.659 --> 51:04.932
So uh, so I was just
checking on you.

51:04.968 --> 51:07.636
Make sure you, you's okay.

51:07.671 --> 51:08.398
- I'm okay.

51:08.433 --> 51:11.503
I just, I just get migraines.

51:11.538 --> 51:14.337
- Oh, I could bring
you something if, if,

51:14.372 --> 51:16.712
ifin that would help.

51:16.748 --> 51:18.512
- Nope, that's okay.

51:19.310 --> 51:20.712
- Oh, sure, sure.

51:23.749 --> 51:28.159
Well, I just, I just um,
I, I just wanna say um,

51:29.487 --> 51:32.229
I'm, I'm sorry about before.

51:33.665 --> 51:34.726
When I, when I,

51:36.362 --> 51:38.796
when I touched-
- That's okay.

51:40.703 --> 51:41.535
- Okay.

51:51.849 --> 51:53.547
All right then, uh.

51:56.522 --> 51:57.320
Goodnight.

52:01.692 --> 52:02.688
- Goodnight.

52:24.614 --> 52:27.750
- Chisos says most people
take double helpings of a lie

52:27.785 --> 52:29.647
if it tastes good.

52:29.683 --> 52:32.588
Leave a healthy plate of
truth out for the dogs.

52:32.624 --> 52:33.455
- Not me.

52:35.460 --> 52:38.125
- Yeah, I guess it depends on
who you're sinning against.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.689
- Chisos words don't lie, child.

52:39.724 --> 52:42.926
- Wait a minute,
who's Cheese Sauce?

52:43.801 --> 52:44.961
- It's Chisos.

52:46.372 --> 52:49.101
Ain't nothing more powerful
than won't come outta his mouth.

52:49.137 --> 52:50.505
And I seen his words

52:50.540 --> 52:53.569
bring a screaming freight
train to a complete stop.

52:53.604 --> 52:56.647
- You mean like an actual train?

52:56.683 --> 52:57.674
- Like a choo choo?

52:57.709 --> 53:00.549
- Yes, darling, an
actual choo choo.

53:00.584 --> 53:02.782
He done it from the front
window in the diner upstairs.

53:02.817 --> 53:05.584
A bunch of doubters heard the
Stud of Butte line coming.

53:05.619 --> 53:09.491
He rose up and held out
his hands like this,

53:10.755 --> 53:12.723
said a few of
those Gaelic words.

53:12.758 --> 53:15.593
You could hear those
brakes from miles away.

53:15.628 --> 53:18.632
All 36 cars come
to a complete stop.

53:19.567 --> 53:22.369
Few more words, he
even made it back up.

53:22.405 --> 53:23.871
- You sure it wasn't
just side tracked?

53:24.909 --> 53:26.805
- It was side tracking.

53:28.709 --> 53:31.714
I'm sure you two have
seen it done to a car.

53:31.749 --> 53:32.608
Am I right?

53:32.643 --> 53:34.410
- I see you got it running, huh?

53:34.446 --> 53:36.318
- It's just a fuse.

53:36.353 --> 53:37.953
Just a little tickle
with my middle finger

53:37.988 --> 53:39.818
and it fired right up.

53:42.326 --> 53:45.863
- Oh my God, baby, did
you just hear that?

53:45.898 --> 53:47.461
Somewhere off in the distance

53:47.496 --> 53:51.269
a freight train just
made a fucking U-turn.

53:53.706 --> 53:54.704
- I'm Chisos.

53:54.740 --> 53:56.067
- Oh, I'm Frank.

53:56.102 --> 53:56.901
- Frank.

53:58.108 --> 54:00.611
Hey, you two are honeymooners.

54:00.647 --> 54:01.240
Is that right?

54:01.275 --> 54:02.846
- Yeah, that's right.

54:02.881 --> 54:03.940
We got your king size

54:03.975 --> 54:06.575
with the flower back
headboard and everything.

54:06.611 --> 54:08.577
We'll try not to wake you.

54:08.613 --> 54:10.354
- You know what they say,

54:10.390 --> 54:13.385
you throw a lie in a river
five days before the truth,

54:13.420 --> 54:15.123
the truth is gonna catch up.

54:15.158 --> 54:18.195
- Especially at this table.

54:18.230 --> 54:21.297
- Most don't make it out
here without a reason.

54:21.332 --> 54:24.333
Being that we're off
the beaten path and all.

54:24.369 --> 54:27.500
So tell me, where are
you newly weds headed?

54:27.535 --> 54:29.774
- Well, see, as a,
as a wedding gift,

54:29.809 --> 54:30.534
my new husband, yeah,

54:30.569 --> 54:31.769
he's promised to take me down

54:31.804 --> 54:33.776
the prettiest road in
the whole fuckin' world.

54:33.812 --> 54:34.738
- Oh well, you-

54:34.774 --> 54:35.880
- Well this is the
wrong part of the world

54:35.915 --> 54:38.115
to find the prettiest road.

54:38.150 --> 54:40.342
- Yeah, it ain't
in this stink hole.

54:40.378 --> 54:41.748
It's west.

54:41.783 --> 54:44.547
My baby here, he said that
he saw it in some movie,

54:44.582 --> 54:46.517
uh, "Thelma & Louise."

54:46.552 --> 54:48.056
It's this road that they go down

54:48.091 --> 54:49.524
at the end of the movie,

54:49.560 --> 54:53.564
and my baby here, he's
gonna take me for a ride.

54:53.599 --> 54:54.431
- Wow.

54:55.399 --> 54:58.297
What a generous and
kind man you are.

54:58.332 --> 55:00.637
I've seen that movie.

55:00.672 --> 55:01.934
Amazing.

55:01.969 --> 55:06.938
To see two love birds about
to take each other for a ride.

55:07.947 --> 55:10.508
You mind if I join you two?

55:10.543 --> 55:12.481
- Well only if you have a story.

55:12.517 --> 55:15.279
You know, seeing as how
that's the rules and all.

55:15.315 --> 55:16.512
- Get us two.

55:16.547 --> 55:17.788
- Just, just two?

55:17.823 --> 55:19.217
- Just for us men.

55:19.253 --> 55:20.523
- Oh.

55:21.457 --> 55:24.588
- So uh, what is
it you do out here?

55:24.623 --> 55:26.494
- But the short version though,

55:26.529 --> 55:29.628
'cause I'm about ready
for that headboard.

55:29.663 --> 55:32.265
- Well the truth
can't be truncated.

55:32.300 --> 55:34.130
- Well, try your best.

55:36.304 --> 55:38.308
- How's this for Cliffs?

55:38.343 --> 55:41.707
Family came out from
Appalachia in 1903.

55:41.742 --> 55:43.742
This mine's been in my
family for generations.

55:43.777 --> 55:46.851
We were the mercury
capital of the world,

55:46.886 --> 55:48.649
till the mine collapsed.

55:48.685 --> 55:50.983
My grandfather was trapped
underneath that mine.

55:51.018 --> 55:54.585
He was leading a prison work
release program for murderers,

55:54.620 --> 55:57.555
rapists, all kinds of filth.

55:57.590 --> 55:59.857
They were left there for dead,

55:59.892 --> 56:02.229
until he came walking
out 11 days later

56:02.264 --> 56:03.628
when the plate shifted.

56:03.664 --> 56:04.995
He was the only
one that made it.

56:05.031 --> 56:09.506
Three dead felons left
below, gnawed to the bone.

56:10.535 --> 56:12.071
- That's crazy.

56:12.106 --> 56:16.340
- See my grandfather,
he survived by
eating those sinners,

56:16.376 --> 56:17.811
organs and all.

56:19.016 --> 56:20.644
Not a secret.

56:20.679 --> 56:22.714
Made the papers everywhere.

56:22.750 --> 56:25.486
What is a secret is
that we are still

56:25.521 --> 56:28.322
Appalachian sin
eaters at our core.

56:28.357 --> 56:29.519
We have been for centuries.

56:29.554 --> 56:30.989
It's in our blood.

56:31.024 --> 56:34.124
So all the drifters, the
travelers, all the runners,

56:34.160 --> 56:38.569
they come and sit down here
at this table and confess,

56:38.604 --> 56:41.635
and we consume in proportion
to the severity of the sin.

56:41.670 --> 56:44.769
Sometimes it's just
a BB behind the ear.

56:44.805 --> 56:48.308
Sometimes it's an
unsurvivable filet,

56:48.344 --> 56:50.540
enough for a table of six.

56:50.575 --> 56:52.011
- What's he doing?

56:52.046 --> 56:54.749
- What he always does when
he ain't gonna let 'em leave.

56:54.784 --> 56:56.851
Fills them with a truth
that's too hard to believe.

56:56.886 --> 57:00.354
- We take the cell phones
down the Juarez, we dump 'em.

57:00.389 --> 57:03.054
We burn the bodies and the cars.

57:04.494 --> 57:06.161
No one has any
idea that it is us

57:06.196 --> 57:07.364
that takes on the burden

57:07.399 --> 57:10.399
that the world would
otherwise have to carry.

57:10.434 --> 57:12.201
I'm equal opportunity
to at fault,

57:12.236 --> 57:14.868
even when it comes to myself.

57:15.836 --> 57:19.235
Sometimes I consume a
taste of my own sin.

57:20.474 --> 57:22.077
- Ugh.
- Jesus Christ.

57:22.113 --> 57:23.877
- I'm just kidding.

57:25.876 --> 57:28.750
But the train part, that's true.

57:29.614 --> 57:31.115
At will on a dime.

57:32.489 --> 57:33.924
And just not
inanimate locomotives.

57:33.959 --> 57:35.418
- Like what else?

57:35.454 --> 57:36.588
- People.

57:36.623 --> 57:37.822
I know all about incentives,

57:37.857 --> 57:41.094
motivations and
overall psychology.

57:41.129 --> 57:41.961
- Okay.

57:43.364 --> 57:44.766
Try me, Freud.

57:48.904 --> 57:53.341
- My family owned over
6,000 mercury rich acres,

57:53.376 --> 57:55.040
but now I'm the only one left.

57:55.076 --> 57:59.913
So last April, I sold almost
all of it for $24 million.

58:02.816 --> 58:05.352
Now I have no one
to spend it on.

58:05.388 --> 58:07.790
No one to give me a child.

58:07.825 --> 58:11.992
And I really want one, for
more than just legacy reasons.

58:12.027 --> 58:15.527
That modest little house up
there at the top of the hill,

58:15.562 --> 58:17.700
you might have seen it.

58:18.764 --> 58:21.033
All of it could be yours.

58:22.870 --> 58:26.841
I'm honest and faithful,
almost to a fault.

58:29.643 --> 58:32.308
So if any of that interests you,

58:33.782 --> 58:37.280
then get up and head
out to the white car.

58:40.123 --> 58:40.717
- 'Nelope.

58:40.752 --> 58:41.651
- I'll meet you there.

58:42.854 --> 58:44.053
- I'm gonna have a word here

58:44.089 --> 58:46.756
and make sure he's
equally compensated.

58:46.791 --> 58:48.962
- 'Nelope, look at me.

58:50.464 --> 58:52.262
'Nelope, 'Nelope!

58:52.297 --> 58:57.707
- Son, son, son, she's a
stripper, she's a grifter.

58:58.241 --> 58:58.972
They all sell it.

59:00.206 --> 59:02.011
If she hasn't taken you
for everything, she will.

59:02.047 --> 59:03.174
- No, she's not.

59:04.980 --> 59:08.246
- So I'm gonna get a nice
little wad of cash for ya.

59:08.281 --> 59:13.250
When you check out, it'll help
to heal that broken heart.

59:23.931 --> 59:27.902
- Morning coffee if he
won't take it today.

59:30.541 --> 59:33.436
- Hey, aren't you
gonna finish that?

59:33.471 --> 59:37.310
It's a wonderful vintage of
distilled damnation right there.

1:00:21.555 --> 1:00:23.056
- Hey.

1:00:24.890 --> 1:00:27.896
- God damn I love you, 'Nelope.

1:00:32.964 --> 1:00:36.400
- Sorry, I had to tinkle,

1:00:36.435 --> 1:00:42.075
and I couldn't take any more
of that garbage he was spewing.

1:00:43.879 --> 1:00:47.977
Hey, you know all those
ways you never told me

1:00:48.012 --> 1:00:51.048
how you were gonna fuck me?

1:00:51.083 --> 1:00:53.017
Well, could you just
forget about 'em

1:00:53.053 --> 1:00:56.292
and come over here
and make love to me

1:00:56.327 --> 1:00:58.190
for a really long time?

1:01:00.764 --> 1:01:04.694
- After that, girl, you
don't even get a say.

hand on my, on...

1:02:29.584 --> 1:02:31.118
I'm okay though.

1:02:44.403 --> 1:02:45.966
- You fucked up really bad,

1:02:46.001 --> 1:02:48.302
and you're gonna have
to make it right.

1:02:48.337 --> 1:02:49.202
- Okay.

1:02:50.303 --> 1:02:52.040
- You got a newborn not
two months in the ground

1:02:52.076 --> 1:02:55.276
and you're already letting
your lustful ways lead you.

1:02:55.311 --> 1:02:56.110
- Do I?

1:02:57.247 --> 1:02:58.546
Do I?

1:02:58.582 --> 1:02:59.614
- What do you whine about?

1:02:59.649 --> 1:03:02.415
- Oh shut up, just shut up.

1:03:02.450 --> 1:03:03.954
- What?

1:03:03.989 --> 1:03:08.021
- You tell me how Mabel give
me a, a boy two months ago,

1:03:08.056 --> 1:03:11.559
and she ain't late with
me in, in three years.

1:03:11.594 --> 1:03:12.889
You tell me how, huh?

1:03:12.925 --> 1:03:15.297
Make me understand-

1:03:24.171 --> 1:03:26.870
- 19 Calls from her
daddy to this number

1:03:26.906 --> 1:03:28.571
starting at- 24 AM.

1:03:29.982 --> 1:03:32.312
I researched the number, he's
a Sanctus County Sheriff.

1:03:32.347 --> 1:03:37.250
He'll be 616 South, and Cookie
said she saw him holding-

1:03:38.585 --> 1:03:39.417
- Go.

1:03:44.525 --> 1:03:45.357
You too.

1:04:17.494 --> 1:04:18.294
- Come on, daddy.

1:04:18.330 --> 1:04:19.292
Where are you?

1:04:20.294 --> 1:04:22.625
- God damn I love waking
up next to you, 'Nelope.

1:04:22.660 --> 1:04:25.094
- I can't believe you
thought I was gonna leave you

1:04:25.129 --> 1:04:27.102
for the Cheese Sauce.

1:04:27.137 --> 1:04:31.403
That idiot doesn't stand
a chance against my Frank.

1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:34.841
- We're
stuck together, baby.

1:04:34.876 --> 1:04:37.776
- Like hot gum on tarmac stuck.

1:04:41.418 --> 1:04:42.315
Holy shit.

1:04:43.751 --> 1:04:45.054
Is this real?

1:04:45.687 --> 1:04:47.123
- Is that another?

1:04:47.158 --> 1:04:52.358
- Oh my God, a Bugs Bunny level
of karats if I ever did see.

1:04:55.294 --> 1:04:56.892
- With this diamond
will thee wed?

1:04:56.927 --> 1:04:57.968
- Don't!

1:04:59.203 --> 1:05:02.535
And don't you never do that
again, unless you mean it.

1:05:02.570 --> 1:05:03.402
- Okay.

1:05:05.642 --> 1:05:07.409
I was just kidding.

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:08.343
- I'm serious.

1:05:08.378 --> 1:05:09.342
- Okay.

1:05:10.778 --> 1:05:12.345
- I'm not a joke.

1:05:14.449 --> 1:05:18.520
- Swear to God I'm gonna
surprise you one day, 'Nelope.

1:05:18.556 --> 1:05:20.221
- They's just words.

1:05:49.288 --> 1:05:50.119
- Morning.

1:05:51.086 --> 1:05:53.323
Just uh, two for
breakfast, please.

1:05:59.224 --> 1:06:02.227
- Uh, yeah, anywhere you want.

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:05.398
- I'm a go with
them cakes, Cookie.

1:06:07.264 --> 1:06:09.932
Damn, this is amazing.

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:11.008
- Hm?

1:06:12.038 --> 1:06:14.077
- My dad was a Marine.

1:06:15.381 --> 1:06:17.007
- You two close?

1:06:17.043 --> 1:06:18.708
- Yeah, were really.

1:06:22.818 --> 1:06:24.714
Lost him when I was 16.

1:06:25.622 --> 1:06:27.156
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:06:28.090 --> 1:06:31.391
- Don't be, 'cause
my 16 with him

1:06:31.427 --> 1:06:36.330
was better than 100 would've
been with any lesser man.

1:06:38.434 --> 1:06:43.634
I planned enlisting myself,
but uh, after my dad died,

1:06:44.602 --> 1:06:48.045
I had to take care of my
mom and little sister.

1:06:49.012 --> 1:06:51.741
- I bet he's proud
of you, Frank.

1:06:52.714 --> 1:06:53.545
- Hope so.

1:06:55.815 --> 1:06:56.647
- He is.

1:06:58.822 --> 1:07:01.124
And what about you, Frank?

1:07:02.058 --> 1:07:04.528
Do you want any
babies of your own?

1:07:04.563 --> 1:07:06.459
- Never not wanted 'em.

1:07:12.964 --> 1:07:13.796
You?

1:07:17.808 --> 1:07:20.341
- Well, I haven't until now.

1:07:45.668 --> 1:07:47.062
Take him.

1:07:47.097 --> 1:07:48.636
- What?

1:07:48.671 --> 1:07:49.502
- Take him.

1:08:08.518 --> 1:08:10.454
- Get your ass outta the car.

1:08:10.489 --> 1:08:11.654
What did I tell ya?
- No, please!

1:08:11.689 --> 1:08:13.463
- What the, you're
the one that made me-

1:08:14.532 --> 1:08:15.829
- Take him.

1:08:15.864 --> 1:08:17.530
Take him with you.

1:08:18.329 --> 1:08:20.434
He'll be our protector.

1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:22.271
Your dad.

1:08:25.775 --> 1:08:27.107
Just take him.

1:08:32.813 --> 1:08:33.645
- Hey!

1:08:35.215 --> 1:08:37.484
Hey, knock that shit off.

1:08:38.152 --> 1:08:40.085
Get your hands off of her!

1:08:40.121 --> 1:08:41.688
Turn around, turn around.

1:08:41.724 --> 1:08:42.651
- She was-

1:08:42.687 --> 1:08:45.855
- Turn around, put
your hands on the hood.

1:08:47.632 --> 1:08:48.431
You okay, sweetie?

1:08:48.466 --> 1:08:49.160
- Yeah.

1:08:49.195 --> 1:08:49.894
- Yeah?
- I'm okay.

1:08:49.930 --> 1:08:51.367
Thank you.

1:08:51.402 --> 1:08:54.001
- What kind of man puts his
hands on a lady like that, huh?

1:08:54.036 --> 1:08:54.999
What is wrong with you, boy?

1:09:05.747 --> 1:09:06.579
- Hey!

1:09:08.784 --> 1:09:10.520
- Freeze!

1:09:10.556 --> 1:09:11.584
Uh, something!

1:09:13.586 --> 1:09:16.451
- Yeah, freeze it right,
you fuckin' weirdo!

1:09:16.487 --> 1:09:18.693
- 'Nelope, go get the car.

1:09:18.728 --> 1:09:19.454
- I'm on it.

1:09:19.490 --> 1:09:22.490
- You, drop that shotgun!

1:09:22.526 --> 1:09:24.696
And you, shut the fuck up!

1:09:28.606 --> 1:09:29.437
Thank you.

1:09:45.890 --> 1:09:48.588
- What the hell just happened?

1:09:50.122 --> 1:09:51.261
Turn right.

1:09:52.124 --> 1:09:53.263
Turn right.

1:09:54.129 --> 1:09:56.629
Turn right you motherfucker.

1:10:10.474 --> 1:10:12.610
Two in the green car.

1:10:12.645 --> 1:10:15.816
- Copy that, they
will not get past us.

1:10:28.525 --> 1:10:30.159
- Speak of the devil.

1:10:30.194 --> 1:10:31.394
- Fuck.

1:10:31.429 --> 1:10:33.633
They're making a U-turn.

1:10:36.367 --> 1:10:37.670
- Go, go, go.

1:10:43.275 --> 1:10:44.543
- It's okay, baby.

1:10:44.578 --> 1:10:46.408
It's probably just
that guy from before.

1:10:46.444 --> 1:10:48.783
I think he likes me.

1:11:06.771 --> 1:11:07.832
- Who's that?

1:11:09.970 --> 1:11:10.802
- Hm.

1:11:14.538 --> 1:11:16.679
Hey, where's my buddy?

1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:18.612

1:11:42.841 --> 1:11:44.368
Hey, the, the girl!

1:11:44.403 --> 1:11:46.037

Now!

1:14:04.949 --> 1:14:06.582
- What about her?

1:14:08.078 --> 1:14:11.884

I ain't touching it.

1:14:29.741 --> 1:14:30.573
Cookie!

1:14:34.504 --> 1:14:35.545
Cookie.

1:14:43.648 --> 1:14:45.283
- I can't lift 'em.

1:15:06.938 --> 1:15:08.742
- Take this one
and get her stowed.

1:15:08.778 --> 1:15:11.774
He's on his way and we've
got a burden to consume.

1:15:11.809 --> 1:15:14.312
Hey, use this if there's a need.

1:18:29.809 --> 1:18:32.674
- He's, he's already up there.

1:18:32.709 --> 1:18:33.511
- Good.

1:18:36.587 --> 1:18:38.955
Get her cleaned
and ready for me.

1:18:38.990 --> 1:18:39.822
- Okay.

1:18:49.730 --> 1:18:52.098
- And with a gentle touch.

1:19:14.391 --> 1:19:15.957
- Hand me the hose.

1:19:22.365 --> 1:19:23.426
Gentle touch.

1:19:24.327 --> 1:19:26.699
- Ain't you supposed
to sponge it?

1:19:26.734 --> 1:19:28.836
- Told you, I ain't touching it.

1:19:28.872 --> 1:19:32.534
- You wanna sponge it
head to toe, go ahead.

1:19:38.614 --> 1:19:41.146
You just don't understand,

1:19:41.182 --> 1:19:45.382
there ain't no harvest
between our whore's legs.

1:20:20.724 --> 1:20:23.926

your your last living gift,
the righteous man's sustenance,

1:20:28.494 --> 1:20:32.998
and we thank you Lord for
bringing us a fertile vessel

1:20:33.033 --> 1:20:35.330
so that we may
continue your work,

1:20:35.366 --> 1:20:38.234
to discern the sheep
from the shepherd,

1:20:38.270 --> 1:20:41.603
and only then will
we dine and cleanse

1:20:43.206 --> 1:20:45.915
until the sheep are no more.

1:20:48.117 --> 1:20:51.112
- Wash me
thoroughly from my iniquities,

1:20:51.148 --> 1:20:54.090
and cleanse me from my...

1:20:54.125 --> 1:20:55.456
- Sin.

1:20:55.492 --> 1:20:57.292
- Amen.

1:21:40.232 --> 1:21:42.337
- You tried longer
than all of them.

1:21:47.576 --> 1:21:49.345
- Where is she?

1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:51.011
- Waiting for me.

1:21:51.046 --> 1:21:54.511
- No, no she's not,
and she never will be.

1:21:56.182 --> 1:21:57.619
- Oh, I think
you'll be surprised.

1:21:57.654 --> 1:22:00.247
- No, I won't be, not this time.

1:22:00.283 --> 1:22:01.383
I've waited my whole life

1:22:01.418 --> 1:22:03.154
to spend the last
48 hours with her,

1:22:03.189 --> 1:22:04.452
and even if that's
all I ever get,

1:22:04.488 --> 1:22:06.995
it'll dwarf anything
you've ever felt.

1:22:07.031 --> 1:22:09.959
She and I have a love not
even death could steal,

1:22:09.994 --> 1:22:11.363
and you know that.

1:22:11.398 --> 1:22:14.030
It's the kind you've only
ever read about in books,

1:22:14.065 --> 1:22:16.201
and you'll never get it.

1:22:16.236 --> 1:22:18.438
- You know what I hate
more than anything?

1:22:18.474 --> 1:22:19.734
Hypocrisy.

1:22:19.770 --> 1:22:22.811
The whole world's full of
uneducated finger pointers,

1:22:22.846 --> 1:22:25.273
pointing mostly
at people like me.

1:22:25.308 --> 1:22:28.245
But make no mistake about it,

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:31.652
we save souls from
eternal damnation.

1:22:31.688 --> 1:22:33.988
That's what sin eaters do.

1:22:34.024 --> 1:22:36.892
Son, that's a 60 gallon
drum of purified water.

1:22:36.928 --> 1:22:39.793
That's survival for at
least a couple weeks.

1:22:39.828 --> 1:22:42.394
Unless, of course, you starve.

1:22:45.898 --> 1:22:47.399
So tell me, punk,

1:22:49.238 --> 1:22:53.138
how long until you take a
bite and become one of us.

1:22:53.173 --> 1:22:54.908
- If you touch her,
I swear to God,

1:22:54.944 --> 1:22:57.706
somehow, someday,
I will find you.

1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:02.310
- This isn't a Batman episode.

1:23:02.345 --> 1:23:05.252
You're not getting outta here.

1:23:07.919 --> 1:23:08.750
- 'Nelope!

1:23:09.821 --> 1:23:10.653
'Nelope!

1:23:11.692 --> 1:23:12.622
I'm coming!

1:23:23.034 --> 1:23:24.403
- Where is he?

1:23:26.509 --> 1:23:27.703
Is he dead?

1:23:27.739 --> 1:23:32.273
- One thing's for sure,
he's, he's not coming for ya.

1:23:32.308 --> 1:23:34.648
- You don't know Frank.

1:23:34.684 --> 1:23:36.448
- Oh, I think I do.

1:23:37.555 --> 1:23:39.120
- What do you want?

1:23:39.156 --> 1:23:41.355
- What you've been giving
away your entire life.

1:23:41.390 --> 1:23:43.755
All of a sudden I want it and
you take it off the shelf?

1:23:43.790 --> 1:23:44.823
Why is that?

1:23:44.859 --> 1:23:46.458
- I ain't for sale.

1:23:47.630 --> 1:23:49.162
I never have been.

1:23:49.198 --> 1:23:51.159
- I bet there's a lot of
inflated dicks out there

1:23:51.195 --> 1:23:52.401
that would disagree.

1:23:52.437 --> 1:23:53.600
What's one more?

1:23:53.635 --> 1:23:54.466
- Fuck you!

1:23:59.504 --> 1:24:02.471
- You should have taken
that walk last night.

1:24:02.507 --> 1:24:05.442
I know you thought
about it, but you know,

1:24:05.477 --> 1:24:08.443
you went to him and that
just breaks my heart.

1:24:08.479 --> 1:24:11.516
- You don't have
a heart to break.

1:24:13.088 --> 1:24:15.589
- You're going to
give me a child.

1:24:15.625 --> 1:24:17.091
That's a fact.

1:24:17.127 --> 1:24:21.189
I'd rather do it with
a coddle then a claw.

1:24:21.224 --> 1:24:22.560
I mean originally,

1:24:22.595 --> 1:24:26.095
every single act procreation
in nature was a rape.

1:24:26.130 --> 1:24:28.263
Only humans asked.

1:24:28.298 --> 1:24:30.502
- You ain't touching me.

1:24:32.272 --> 1:24:35.606
- Why is it so valuable
all of a sudden.

1:24:36.873 --> 1:24:38.945
I mean, you've been using
God's reproductive system

1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:41.480
as a tool your entire life.

1:24:41.515 --> 1:24:46.653
I mean, either sex is
meaningless or rape is bad.

1:24:46.689 --> 1:24:47.651
Can't be both.

1:24:55.196 --> 1:24:57.328
- It's the hand
that holds the gift

1:24:57.363 --> 1:24:59.827
that can change
what's in the box,

1:24:59.863 --> 1:25:03.603
and I ain't ever willingly
held it out for free.

1:25:03.639 --> 1:25:04.536
Not once.

1:25:05.708 --> 1:25:06.736
Not for nobody.

1:25:08.271 --> 1:25:09.541
Except Frank.

1:25:12.079 --> 1:25:13.576
You think you's talking over

1:25:13.612 --> 1:25:17.747
a lowly stripper's head
all the time, don't ya?

1:25:19.723 --> 1:25:20.948
Just eats you alive

1:25:20.984 --> 1:25:26.393
that I got a freight train
of love headed only for him,

1:25:27.061 --> 1:25:29.264
and not even you can budge it.

1:25:47.146 --> 1:25:48.745
- I could love you,

1:25:49.950 --> 1:25:51.319
if you let me.

1:25:53.591 --> 1:25:54.619
Think about it.

1:25:56.827 --> 1:25:59.360
I'll see you in the morning.

1:26:02.433 --> 1:26:03.265
- No.

1:26:05.498 --> 1:26:09.535
Somehow in my heart I
know he's coming for me.

1:26:23.517 --> 1:26:27.119
- Who
will be put to shame.

1:26:28.658 --> 1:26:29.819
In Greek,

1:26:29.854 --> 1:26:33.625
you will be humiliated by
this misplaced confidence.

1:26:40.904 --> 1:26:42.997
So he says in Psalms 5...

1:26:55.178 --> 1:26:56.010
- Daddy.

1:26:57.313 --> 1:26:58.753
Dad, daddy.

1:27:03.857 --> 1:27:04.689
No!

1:27:06.090 --> 1:27:07.793
No!

1:27:07.828 --> 1:27:08.630
Daddy.

1:27:22.007 --> 1:27:22.839
No!

1:28:32.408 --> 1:28:33.613
- I'm sorry,

1:28:36.952 --> 1:28:38.112
for all of it.

1:29:40.412 --> 1:29:42.517
- Stare all you can do?

1:29:44.582 --> 1:29:47.415
- I'm supposed to watch ya.

1:29:47.451 --> 1:29:48.787
Chisos said so.

1:29:48.822 --> 1:29:53.627
- You know staring and
watching aren't the same thing.

1:29:54.859 --> 1:29:58.764
And I feel you staring
something powerful.

1:29:59.967 --> 1:30:00.799
Yeah.

1:30:02.105 --> 1:30:04.803
Powerful like a freight train.

1:30:05.771 --> 1:30:09.511
Do you mind if I call
you Freight Train?

1:30:11.047 --> 1:30:12.039
- Whatever you want,

1:30:12.074 --> 1:30:15.484
I'm just here doing
what I'm supposed to.

1:30:18.454 --> 1:30:21.685
- You know, I felt them
hands on me earlier,

1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:25.093
longer than was
strictly necessary,

1:30:25.128 --> 1:30:27.661
and they felt powerful, too.

1:30:29.492 --> 1:30:30.631
But gentle.

1:30:32.564 --> 1:30:34.998
You a gentle fella deep down?

1:30:36.665 --> 1:30:38.166
- Not with ladies.

1:30:39.570 --> 1:30:41.741
I don't mean to be, but,

1:30:42.642 --> 1:30:45.745
I get excited,
handle 'em too rough.

1:30:48.451 --> 1:30:52.384
Everyone they brought
me, even my wife,

1:30:52.419 --> 1:30:54.849
got a hold of her too hard.

1:30:54.885 --> 1:30:58.051
Now her windpipe
don't work right.

1:30:58.087 --> 1:31:01.893
Shy's away from me
touching her at all now.

1:31:02.996 --> 1:31:07.795
- Well you know, rough ain't
so bad when you're used to it.

1:31:07.830 --> 1:31:10.402
In fact, rough makes some girls

1:31:10.437 --> 1:31:12.937
wetter than the Pontchartrain.

1:31:15.012 --> 1:31:16.908
Can you keep a secret?

1:31:18.741 --> 1:31:20.912
I'm one of them girls,

1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:23.779
and I ain't felt
nothing in them hands

1:31:23.815 --> 1:31:26.918
that I don't find
myself wanting,

1:31:28.488 --> 1:31:31.356
and I think you want it, too.

1:31:31.391 --> 1:31:33.994
Them hands all over me.

1:31:42.769 --> 1:31:46.773
I ain't trying to
trick you to get out.

1:31:46.808 --> 1:31:51.008
Hell, you could even come
in here if you wanted to.

1:31:52.149 --> 1:31:54.143
I gotta touch you proper.

1:31:54.179 --> 1:31:56.910
Come on, you can't get me
out like this then deny me.

1:31:56.945 --> 1:31:59.416
- Chisos wouldn't stand for it.

1:31:59.452 --> 1:32:00.581
- Fuck Cheese Sauce.

1:32:02.921 --> 1:32:06.826
Besides, I thought we
was keeping secrets.

1:32:09.565 --> 1:32:11.192
You know, it's a secret
that's never told

1:32:11.227 --> 1:32:15.830
that offers the most
extraordinary of suspense.

1:32:15.865 --> 1:32:18.134
And I don't know about you,

1:32:19.869 --> 1:32:23.107
but I ain't gonna tell a soul.

1:32:23.143 --> 1:32:24.112
Shh.

1:32:41.593 --> 1:32:43.660
- Stick your leg out.

1:32:43.695 --> 1:32:45.832
- Okay, I'll do what you say,

1:32:45.868 --> 1:32:50.801
but then when I get out, you
gotta do what I say, too.

1:32:50.837 --> 1:32:54.335
Teasing makes the
pleasing so much better.

1:32:57.780 --> 1:33:01.947
Once you get that thing
fastened, sit down, okay?

1:33:17.530 --> 1:33:19.195
Go on, sit down now.

1:33:30.008 --> 1:33:31.940
Gonna have to scooch
away from that table

1:33:31.976 --> 1:33:35.183
if you want me to
sit in your lap.

1:33:51.899 --> 1:33:56.366
- I need you to know
that I'm a religious man.

1:33:56.401 --> 1:33:57.233
I am.

1:33:59.242 --> 1:34:00.940
I do believe in, in,

1:34:00.976 --> 1:34:05.046
in carrying the weight of
the world by consuming sin.

1:34:05.082 --> 1:34:06.209
I do, I just do.

1:34:07.378 --> 1:34:10.485
even if you people
think we's crazy and all.

1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:12.650
- No, nobody thinks
you're crazy.

1:34:12.685 --> 1:34:13.650
Nobody thinks you're crazy.

1:34:13.685 --> 1:34:15.952
- It's just, I, I, I, I,

1:34:15.987 --> 1:34:17.955
I can't find nothing
wrong ya done.

1:34:17.991 --> 1:34:20.557
- Like I said, nothing's
wrong, nothing's wrong.

1:34:20.593 --> 1:34:21.793
Nobody did nothing.

1:34:21.828 --> 1:34:22.792
- If you'd have
done some sinning.

1:34:22.827 --> 1:34:24.529
- Nobody did nothing.

1:34:24.564 --> 1:34:26.267
- I'd a had no issue.

1:34:26.302 --> 1:34:27.564
- Just gotta help me.

1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:28.567
Help me outta here.

1:34:28.603 --> 1:34:31.834
Look, just, just
throw me a rope.

1:34:31.870 --> 1:34:32.899
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1:34:32.935 --> 1:34:34.169
All you gotta do is-

1:34:34.205 --> 1:34:35.343
- No, no, shut your mouth.
- Help us, please.

1:34:35.378 --> 1:34:36.244
- Just shut your fuckin' mouth!

1:34:36.279 --> 1:34:38.344
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

1:34:38.379 --> 1:34:40.078
Just shut it, now!

1:34:43.312 --> 1:34:47.448
I ain't gonna save you
and cross my own people,

1:34:48.424 --> 1:34:50.424
but you can save yourself.

1:34:50.459 --> 1:34:51.692
- What are you talking about?

1:34:51.727 --> 1:34:54.796
What are
you talking about?

1:34:54.832 --> 1:34:57.629
- You gonna have to commit
a sin just like me to do it.

1:34:57.664 --> 1:35:00.131
- What are you talking about?

1:35:06.571 --> 1:35:07.402
The fuck?

1:35:11.509 --> 1:35:12.740
God!

1:35:39.539 --> 1:35:40.974
- No child, no.

1:35:50.682 --> 1:35:52.183
Bless you, child.

1:35:54.119 --> 1:35:57.554
I'll tell him you loved
him by dying today.

1:36:18.415 --> 1:36:19.774
You're still out, ain't you?

1:36:23.981 --> 1:36:26.012
You keep that love alive.

1:36:26.048 --> 1:36:28.289
You hear me, child?

1:36:28.324 --> 1:36:30.023
You hold on tight.

1:36:31.053 --> 1:36:33.392
Don't ever let it go.

1:37:06.889 --> 1:37:07.929
- Scooch.

1:37:17.169 --> 1:37:20.939
- You get in that
corner and turn around.

1:37:20.974 --> 1:37:23.311
This ain't a wifely
thing to watch.

1:37:33.322 --> 1:37:34.252
- Uh-uh-uh.

1:37:35.558 --> 1:37:38.289
Teasin' first, pleasin' second.

1:37:43.629 --> 1:37:44.625
Here you go.

1:37:47.336 --> 1:37:48.167
Just look.

1:37:52.042 --> 1:37:57.176
You never laid eyes on anything
like this before, have you?

1:38:06.017 --> 1:38:08.319
You ready, Freight Train?

1:38:12.261 --> 1:38:13.093
Tell me.

1:38:13.956 --> 1:38:15.695
- I'm ready.

1:38:15.730 --> 1:38:18.329
- No, look at me and tell me.

1:38:20.028 --> 1:38:21.233
- I'm ready.

1:38:25.339 --> 1:38:29.978
- If you meet him, tell him
I'm sorry about the past.

1:38:42.151 --> 1:38:44.190
- 'Nelope, I'm coming!

1:38:58.771 --> 1:39:00.173
- Frank, Frank!

1:39:01.544 --> 1:39:03.374
Oh God damn it, Frank!

1:39:04.611 --> 1:39:05.442
- 'Nelope!

1:39:06.748 --> 1:39:08.176
- Frank, Frank!

1:39:08.211 --> 1:39:10.516
Frank, I can't reach the keys!

1:39:13.656 --> 1:39:15.119
