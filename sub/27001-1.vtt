01:15.267 --> 01:17.697
Thanks for taking
the time to do this, Santa.

01:17.699 --> 01:19.041
I know how busy you
are this time of year.

01:19.043 --> 01:22.561
We
certainly are, Corkie.

01:22.563 --> 01:25.664
But we've always got time
for our favorite reporter.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.201
Especially after what
happened last year.

01:27.203 --> 01:29.408
Am I right?

01:29.410 --> 01:31.745
Never underestimate the power
of a well-positioned puff piece

01:31.747 --> 01:34.592
to make the public forget.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.065
I'm kidding.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.184
This is going to be some
hard-hitting journalism

01:37.186 --> 01:39.136
right here.

01:39.138 --> 01:42.241
Again, kidding.

01:42.243 --> 01:43.522
How about you just
show me the reindeer?

01:53.155 --> 01:55.776
As you can see, we have no
problems with the reindeer...

01:55.778 --> 01:57.440
no problems at all.

01:57.442 --> 01:59.968
We've got everything
under control.

01:59.970 --> 02:01.793
You're gonna want to
write that one down.

02:01.795 --> 02:03.713
"Everything under control."

02:03.715 --> 02:04.416
Yeah.

02:04.418 --> 02:05.665
Wow.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.072
I can see that.

02:07.074 --> 02:08.993
It's almost like you don't
even need to establish

02:08.995 --> 02:11.904
the training camps.

02:11.906 --> 02:15.200
There's just one thing.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.481
Shouldn't there
be eight of them?

02:16.483 --> 02:17.121
What?

02:17.123 --> 02:19.296
Well, of course, there is...

02:19.298 --> 02:23.041
four, five, six, seven.

02:23.043 --> 02:23.843
Oh, no.

02:57.890 --> 02:59.649
Big dreamers dream big.

02:59.651 --> 03:00.544
Come on, Elliot.

03:00.546 --> 03:02.016
You can do better than that.

03:02.018 --> 03:04.544
Big dreamers dream big.

03:04.546 --> 03:07.295
I still can't hear you.

03:07.297 --> 03:09.248
Big
dreamers dream big!

03:09.250 --> 03:11.457
That's what
I'm talking about!

03:11.459 --> 03:13.152
Well, don't just stand
there grinning like a fool.

03:13.154 --> 03:14.112
Go!

03:14.114 --> 03:15.651
Go, go, go.

03:20.803 --> 03:21.667
Go, go, go.

03:28.674 --> 03:30.305
Come on, Elliot.
Go, go.

03:30.307 --> 03:30.755
Move!

03:34.915 --> 03:37.792
14.59 seconds exactly.

03:37.794 --> 03:38.913
Yes!

03:38.915 --> 03:39.873
Yes!

03:39.875 --> 03:41.185
I finally broke 15 seconds.

03:41.187 --> 03:44.031
127th time's the charm.

03:44.033 --> 03:45.857
Let's hit the salt lick.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.705
Aren't you
forgetting something?

03:48.707 --> 03:51.617
Actually, I thought maybe
we could skip it today?

03:51.619 --> 03:52.512
Oh, sure.

03:52.514 --> 03:53.537
Why not?

03:53.539 --> 03:55.551
Cutting a workout short
never hurt anyone, right?

03:55.553 --> 03:56.577
Exactly.

03:56.579 --> 03:58.016
- Thanks, Hazel.
- Hah.

03:58.018 --> 03:59.392
That's so funny.

03:59.394 --> 04:00.960
What's that thing
coach always says?

04:00.962 --> 04:03.905
"Success trains,
failure complains"?

04:03.907 --> 04:06.017
No, that's not it.

04:06.019 --> 04:07.584
"The moment you
quit is the moment

04:07.586 --> 04:09.695
you let someone else win"?

04:09.697 --> 04:10.497
No!

04:10.499 --> 04:11.968
No, Hazel, no.

04:11.970 --> 04:13.888
That's not it, either.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.264
Oh, I know.

04:15.266 --> 04:16.671
"If it's important,
you'll find a way.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.368
If not, you'll find an excuse."

04:18.370 --> 04:20.065
That's it!

04:20.067 --> 04:23.073
Oh, that phrase just popped
in my head so out of the blue.

04:23.075 --> 04:24.867
Isn't that so funny and weird?

04:29.026 --> 04:29.600
Fine.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.144
OK.

04:30.146 --> 04:31.841
Forget I said anything.

04:31.843 --> 04:32.547
I'll do it.

04:44.131 --> 04:46.336
I don't know why we're
bothering with this.

04:46.338 --> 04:47.520
Really, just give
it a decade or two,

04:47.522 --> 04:50.272
and global warming is going to
make this a total non-issue.

04:50.274 --> 04:53.152
Call me crazy, Elliot, but I
don't think our strategy should

04:53.154 --> 04:55.584
be predicated on an ecological
catastrophe from which

04:55.586 --> 04:58.432
the world will never recover.

04:58.434 --> 04:59.299
Well, when you
put it that way...

05:03.809 --> 05:04.575
All right.

05:04.577 --> 05:05.313
OK, good.

05:05.315 --> 05:06.560
Good start.

05:06.562 --> 05:08.001
That's what you always say.

05:08.003 --> 05:11.169
Try dispersing your
weight more evenly.

05:11.171 --> 05:11.841
That's it!

05:11.843 --> 05:12.897
You're doing it!

05:12.899 --> 05:14.304
I... I can't believe it!

05:14.306 --> 05:17.058
It's working!
Uh-oh.

05:20.579 --> 05:22.433
And that, ladies
and goats, is why

05:22.435 --> 05:24.479
Santa's always used reindeer.

05:24.481 --> 05:26.560
Um, a little help here?

05:26.562 --> 05:27.332
Ah, hold your
miniature horses.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.432
What are you two doing
messing with the climate

05:34.434 --> 05:35.617
generator again?

05:35.619 --> 05:38.176
These things are dangerous!

05:38.178 --> 05:39.968
I think I hear Peanut
Butter calling me.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.632
Coming!

05:41.634 --> 05:43.520
They already broke
the off button.

05:43.522 --> 05:44.193
Next thing you
know, they'll bust

05:44.195 --> 05:46.047
the emergency shut down, too.

05:46.049 --> 05:47.841
Ah, coach, you worry too much.

05:50.498 --> 05:51.776
Hey, guess what?

05:51.778 --> 05:54.464
I finally broke 15 seconds!

05:56.322 --> 05:58.305
I mean, yeah, there's still
the whole can't climb a snow

05:58.307 --> 05:59.616
drift issue to contend with.

05:59.618 --> 06:01.537
But if you just
give me a chance,

06:01.539 --> 06:03.905
I know I'd have a shot
at making Santa's team.

06:03.907 --> 06:04.608
I just know it.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.240
Elliot, I can't
understand you.

06:06.242 --> 06:07.969
I'm not one of Santa's elves.

06:09.123 --> 06:09.695
Go on now.

06:09.697 --> 06:10.625
Get!

06:10.627 --> 06:11.680
Goat run's about to start.

06:11.682 --> 06:13.985
Aw, coach, not the goats!

06:13.987 --> 06:14.751
Peanut Butter can handle the...

06:14.753 --> 06:16.415
Goats, Elliot.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.082
- I wanted to show you my moves!
- Now!

06:22.275 --> 06:23.135
Goats.

06:23.137 --> 06:23.903
Goats.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.120
So many goats.

06:25.122 --> 06:27.456
Line up in an orderly fashion.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.832
Oh.

06:28.834 --> 06:32.127
For the love of...
work with me, goats.

06:32.129 --> 06:35.423
Ah, get off me, [INAUDIBLE].

06:35.425 --> 06:36.609
You're late!

06:36.611 --> 06:39.488
And these fool goats
won't herd themselves.

06:39.490 --> 06:40.288
What?

06:40.290 --> 06:42.399
- Who are you calling a fool?
- You!

06:42.401 --> 06:44.608
You great cloven-hooved ninny.

06:44.610 --> 06:46.369
You have
responsibilities, Elliot.

06:46.371 --> 06:48.352
Ugh.
Let's just get this over with.

06:48.354 --> 06:50.080
I should totally be
carbo-loading right now.

06:50.082 --> 06:52.417
I'll have you know
the running of the goats

06:52.419 --> 06:55.136
has been a beloved and
dignified tradition

06:55.138 --> 06:57.025
for more than 25 years!

06:57.027 --> 06:58.496
Heads up, old man!

07:02.274 --> 07:04.545
Oh, yeah, so dignified.

07:04.547 --> 07:06.051
Oh, shut it.

07:25.026 --> 07:26.592
Miss Ludzinka?

07:26.594 --> 07:27.841
Hello.

07:27.843 --> 07:30.432
Didn't we schedule your
walk through for tomorrow?

07:30.434 --> 07:32.097
I come today.

07:32.099 --> 07:34.527
I can
see that, and that's awesome.

07:34.529 --> 07:36.352
It's just I've got
this open house...

07:36.354 --> 07:38.817
Today!

07:38.819 --> 07:39.999
OK, then.

07:40.001 --> 07:40.675
Great chat.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.040
I haven't seen
a crowd like this

07:47.042 --> 07:49.473
since I was but a wee fawn.

07:49.475 --> 07:52.736
This calls for an
inspirational speech.

07:53.666 --> 07:54.751
Oh, man.

07:54.753 --> 07:58.239
Goats of witty
pity, hear me now.

07:58.241 --> 08:00.481
You've come to run
as free gourdes,

08:00.483 --> 08:03.136
and free goats you are.

08:03.138 --> 08:05.088
The old coot's
finally lost it.

08:05.090 --> 08:07.296
You're assuming
he ever had it.

08:07.298 --> 08:11.104
What will you
do with that freedom, goats?

08:14.817 --> 08:16.672
Mm, no.

08:16.674 --> 08:17.728
Ay, goats.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.551
Learn, and you may die.

08:19.553 --> 08:21.215
Goat run, and you'll live...

08:21.217 --> 08:22.657
at least a while.

08:22.659 --> 08:24.896
What kind of a
pep talk is this?

08:24.898 --> 08:25.345
But would
you be willing to trade...

08:25.347 --> 08:26.112
All right.

08:26.114 --> 08:26.913
That's it.

08:26.915 --> 08:27.584
...everything for one

08:27.586 --> 08:28.896
chance to tell your enemies...

08:29.858 --> 08:32.192
...that
they may take our goats,

08:32.193 --> 08:35.393
but they will never
take our goat land!

08:38.722 --> 08:41.857
Jeez, take it
easy, Peanut Butter.

08:41.859 --> 08:42.724
Hello, goat.

08:54.881 --> 08:57.055
Nice duck and
weave, Blueberry.

08:57.057 --> 08:57.985
Thanks!

09:01.410 --> 09:05.216
Yee!
Ha, ha!

09:05.218 --> 09:05.508
Oh!

09:10.337 --> 09:12.131
Uh!
Ah!

09:17.666 --> 09:18.592
Thanks, Elliot.

09:21.634 --> 09:24.383
Oh, I forgot how
good adulation feels.

09:24.385 --> 09:26.592
I'm pretty sure
they're cheering for me.

09:26.594 --> 09:27.425
Yeah.

09:27.427 --> 09:29.473
Keep telling yourself
that, shorty.

09:52.769 --> 09:55.329
There they are, the reindeer.

09:55.331 --> 09:57.249
The reindeer are finally here.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.744
You people love DJ.

10:27.746 --> 10:28.899
Yes you do.

10:37.282 --> 10:38.720
It's true.

10:38.722 --> 10:42.273
DJ is fabulous.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.424
OK, huddle up.

10:43.426 --> 10:44.192
All right.

10:44.194 --> 10:44.640
Good run, guys.

10:44.642 --> 10:45.505
Good run.

10:45.507 --> 10:47.104
Nice work out there.

10:47.106 --> 10:50.015
Hey everyone, I'm all
warmed up and ready to go.

10:50.017 --> 10:50.880
Hey, come on, guys.

10:50.882 --> 10:53.120
Make some room.

10:53.122 --> 10:54.657
Yo, mini man.

10:54.659 --> 10:57.055
I thought I made
myself clear yesterday.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.497
Let him join in, DJ.

10:58.499 --> 10:59.264
We don't mind.

10:59.266 --> 11:02.399
Well, I'm team
captain and I do.

11:02.401 --> 11:04.288
When are you going
to give up, runt?

11:04.290 --> 11:07.489
Because DJ is getting
tired of this.

11:07.491 --> 11:11.233
Oh, I'll never give up,
so DJ better get used to it.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.095
Is that so?

11:12.097 --> 11:14.143
Yeah, it is.

11:14.145 --> 11:15.936
I'll say this, little dude.

11:15.938 --> 11:19.296
Persistence is an admirable
quality, just real admirable.

11:19.298 --> 11:20.256
Thanks, DJ.

11:20.258 --> 11:22.560
I appreciate that.

11:22.562 --> 11:24.960
For a reindeer.

11:24.962 --> 11:26.785
Stinking reindeer.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.631
Think they're so special.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.031
Um, don't look now,
but... what are you doing?

11:32.033 --> 11:33.951
I said not to look.

11:33.953 --> 11:37.026
Hello.
Mhm.

11:43.554 --> 11:45.823
So you, uh, you're
going to eat that?

11:45.825 --> 11:46.400
What?

11:46.402 --> 11:46.848
Ew, no.

11:46.850 --> 11:49.535
Come on, Hazel.

11:49.537 --> 11:51.648
Ew.

11:51.650 --> 11:54.752
God, that is the
worst beef jerky

11:54.754 --> 11:57.023
I've ever tasted in my life.

11:57.025 --> 11:59.199
That's because beef had
nothing to do with it.

11:59.201 --> 11:59.937
Why?

11:59.939 --> 12:01.761
What's it say?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.968
Ludzinka's Llama Sticks.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.920
What the what?

12:05.922 --> 12:09.728
Raised by Mama Llama in
Peru, dehydrated by Ludzinka

12:09.730 --> 12:12.448
in Duluth.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.848
This just in from
Santa's workshop.

12:14.850 --> 12:16.736
The world's been
stunned this holiday

12:16.738 --> 12:19.744
season by a startling turn
of events at the North Pole.

12:19.746 --> 12:21.376
Oh my gosh, it can't be true.

12:21.378 --> 12:22.531
So close to Christmas?

12:25.473 --> 12:27.392
I can confirm the rumor.

12:27.394 --> 12:29.920
Blitzen announced his
retirement late last night,

12:29.922 --> 12:31.713
effective immediately.

12:31.715 --> 12:32.895
Was it a medical emergency?

12:32.897 --> 12:34.687
A family crisis?

12:34.689 --> 12:37.759
Or is he the one behind
Dancer's conscious uncoupling?

12:37.761 --> 12:39.904
Because there has
been talk and photos.

12:39.906 --> 12:41.503
They're everywhere.

12:41.505 --> 12:44.352
Ahem.

12:44.354 --> 12:46.239
The truth is a juice
bar in the Keys

12:46.241 --> 12:50.784
he'd been eyeing for a while
finally came on the market.

12:50.786 --> 12:53.697
Accordingly, we're
calling up our top draft

12:53.699 --> 12:55.680
candidates for an
emergency trial

12:55.682 --> 12:57.472
session starting tomorrow.

12:57.474 --> 12:58.687
You can't possibly
expect to find

12:58.689 --> 13:00.065
a replacement in three days.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.568
Will there even
be a Christmas?

13:01.570 --> 13:03.712
And does Blitzen do a
coldpressed GSI blend?

13:03.714 --> 13:06.111
Because my adrenals have
been sued for sluggish.

13:06.113 --> 13:07.234
No more questions.

13:10.018 --> 13:11.967
Well, what are
you all looking at?

13:11.969 --> 13:13.888
We've got to a trial to get to.

13:14.785 --> 13:16.319
DJ's going big leagues.

13:16.321 --> 13:17.728
DJ's going big leagues.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.591
DJ's going big leagues.

13:18.593 --> 13:19.808
Yes he is, yes he is.

13:19.810 --> 13:20.547
Zip it, rock star.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.824
What's your problem, Clyde?

13:25.826 --> 13:27.936
Why you got to rain
on DJ's parade?

13:27.938 --> 13:29.631
Who said you're our top pick?

13:29.633 --> 13:32.160
Oh I get it.

13:32.162 --> 13:35.392
You want to be a
little more reindeerly.

13:35.394 --> 13:38.879
Mr. Assistant Coach, sir, even
though I'm the number one seed

13:38.881 --> 13:41.055
in the whole entire
world, I humbly

13:41.057 --> 13:43.583
ask that you choose
me for the honor, nay,

13:43.585 --> 13:47.424
the privilege to
serve as the Witty

13:46.498 --> 13:49.281
Bitty Farm's representative
at the North Pole tryouts.

13:49.283 --> 13:55.071
But only if it pleases you,
you're most gracious immanence.

13:55.073 --> 13:56.672
Please, Mr. Assistant Coach?

13:56.674 --> 13:59.456
He promises to be a good boy.

13:59.458 --> 14:00.831
Knock it off, all of you.

14:02.977 --> 14:05.856
Why Santa insists on
working with reindeer,

14:05.858 --> 14:09.056
when any other animal could do
a better job, I'll never know.

14:09.058 --> 14:11.361
And if Coach understood
even half the trash

14:11.363 --> 14:13.920
you nimwits talk, he'd agree.

14:13.922 --> 14:15.391
Did you hear that, Hazel?

14:15.393 --> 14:16.767
This is my chance
to prove I'm just as

14:16.769 --> 14:19.455
good as any stinking reindeer.

14:19.457 --> 14:21.921
Good luck.

14:21.923 --> 14:23.936
So the housing market's
pretty crazy in the North Pole,

14:23.938 --> 14:25.761
- isn't it?
- Elliot, what are you doing?

14:25.763 --> 14:27.328
Demonstrating a hairpin turn.

14:27.330 --> 14:29.344
Why?

14:29.346 --> 14:30.753
Hey, Coach, check it out.

14:35.394 --> 14:36.896
Stopping on a dime.

14:36.898 --> 14:39.391
There's a shortage
of housing I hear.

14:39.393 --> 14:41.439
I'm even amazing
in reverse, Coach.

14:41.441 --> 14:42.719
Elliot, stop.

14:42.721 --> 14:45.152
But I've been
training so hard, Clyde.

14:45.154 --> 14:49.023
If you and Coach would
just give me a chance.

14:49.025 --> 14:50.400
Well, looky looky.

14:50.402 --> 14:52.993
Little horse is trying out.

14:52.995 --> 14:57.184
Oh man, DJ couldn't ask for
a funner humiliation himself.

14:57.186 --> 14:58.687
Nice form.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.418
- Little guy's not half bad.
- What?

15:04.481 --> 15:05.504
Not again.

15:05.506 --> 15:07.552
Get him back to the goat
pin, would you, old fella?

15:07.554 --> 15:11.103
I don't have time for any
more of his antics today.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.256
Coach, wait.

15:12.258 --> 15:14.143
You don't see me run
the tire course yet.

15:14.145 --> 15:15.104
Coach, please.

15:15.106 --> 15:16.191
Oh no.

15:16.193 --> 15:20.256
No, no, no, no, no.

15:20.258 --> 15:22.624
Elliot, you OK in there?

15:29.313 --> 15:31.487
He didn't even notice me.

15:31.489 --> 15:32.640
What a loser.

15:32.642 --> 15:35.232
No you didn't.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.992
You wouldn't want to be
a part of this anyway, kid.

15:36.994 --> 15:38.847
Go back to the goats, buddy.

15:38.849 --> 15:39.903
Let him go.

15:39.905 --> 15:40.447
Go lock in.

15:40.449 --> 15:41.859
We've got to go lock in.

15:45.474 --> 15:46.018
Aw, Elliot.

15:49.537 --> 15:51.520
Twas a solid effort, lad.

15:51.522 --> 15:53.152
Yeah, thanks.

15:53.154 --> 15:54.463
But that's what
you get for trying

15:54.465 --> 15:56.607
to be something you're not.

15:56.609 --> 16:00.416
Well, pardon me for wanting
to do something with my life.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.168
Are you implying my
life isn't important?

16:03.170 --> 16:07.104
To think I thought you'd
take over for me one day.

16:07.106 --> 16:11.007
You don't deserve the honor
of overseeing the goat run.

16:11.009 --> 16:17.439
Nobody cares about the
goat run or the mini horses

16:17.441 --> 16:20.672
in charge of it.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.840
Pst.
Hey Elliot, wake up.

16:31.842 --> 16:34.400
Just get up.

16:34.402 --> 16:35.712
Come on.

16:35.714 --> 16:37.663
Hazel?

16:37.665 --> 16:38.657
What are you doing?

16:38.659 --> 16:40.799
Oh, you know, just
heading up the back nine.

16:40.801 --> 16:42.239
Want to play buck a ball?

16:42.241 --> 16:43.616
You're golfing?

16:43.618 --> 16:45.248
I'm stuck.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.032
Help me.

16:48.034 --> 16:49.791
Wait.

16:49.793 --> 16:52.256
You're not going to
eat that, are you?

16:52.258 --> 16:53.791
Oh, how dare you.

16:53.793 --> 16:55.936
That is a vicious stereotype.

16:55.938 --> 16:59.647
I have never eaten a
tin can in my life.

16:59.649 --> 17:00.544
OK, fine.

17:00.546 --> 17:04.256
I'm a goat and I eat
tin cans, all right?

17:04.258 --> 17:06.496
Can you please stop
judging me now?

17:06.498 --> 17:08.415
I am vulnerable.

17:08.416 --> 17:09.952
What do you need me to do?

17:09.954 --> 17:13.406
Um, pull.

17:13.409 --> 17:14.338
Whoa, easy.

17:18.626 --> 17:19.583
You're going to
have to go get that.

17:19.585 --> 17:20.256
It's your can.

17:20.258 --> 17:21.119
You get it.

17:21.122 --> 17:23.487
Fine, we'll do it together.

17:23.489 --> 17:24.575
Big baby.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.742
1, 2, 3.

17:30.081 --> 17:32.640
Quick, grab it.

17:33.506 --> 17:34.623
Ew.

17:34.625 --> 17:37.759
Young man, no
wife, no childrens.

17:37.761 --> 17:40.800
To own a petting
zoo is weird to me.

17:40.802 --> 17:42.016
Yeah, OK.

17:42.018 --> 17:46.047
Well, like I said, I inherited
the place from my grandparents.

17:46.049 --> 17:48.511
You sure you'll be able to give
them a good home, Ms. Ludzinka?

17:48.513 --> 17:49.727
No need worry.

17:49.729 --> 17:54.591
I give my animals only the best,
organic feed, insulated pins.

17:54.593 --> 17:59.520
I keep them very
happy and tenderized.

17:59.522 --> 18:02.112
Sorry, did you say tenderized?

18:02.114 --> 18:02.976
Tenderhearted.

18:02.978 --> 18:03.519
Forgive me.

18:03.521 --> 18:06.975
My English, not so good.

18:06.977 --> 18:10.592
Sure you're
not throwing reindeer.

18:10.594 --> 18:12.479
I like reindeer.

18:12.481 --> 18:14.847
Good and gamey.

18:14.849 --> 18:17.152
They are good at games.

18:17.154 --> 18:21.343
I mean, I love to play
different games with my friends.

18:21.345 --> 18:23.519
The reindeer are the
future of this place.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.951
No, only the petting zoo
animals are for sale.

18:25.953 --> 18:27.424
OK.

18:27.426 --> 18:30.111
I already make you a good offer,
better than anyone else's,

18:30.113 --> 18:32.031
I'm sure.

18:32.033 --> 18:36.447
Actually, you made
the only offer, so.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.976
You're not so good at
bargaining thing, huh?

18:38.978 --> 18:39.711
What do you mean?

18:39.713 --> 18:40.511
Oh, nothing.

18:40.513 --> 18:41.631
Nothing.

18:41.633 --> 18:42.687
Shake hand.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.047
We have deal.

18:46.049 --> 18:47.840
We'll finalize the
paperwork when I get back.

18:47.842 --> 18:48.959
Ooh.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.762
Moist, very moist hand.

18:56.162 --> 18:59.136
Peanutbutter, wake up.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.920
What are you two
dunderheads doing in my stall

19:01.922 --> 19:03.679
at this unholy hour?

19:03.681 --> 19:04.864
Coach is selling
us, Peanutbutter.

19:04.866 --> 19:06.752
To a crazy lady.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.439
Who dehydrates
llamas in Duluth.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.159
So he's finally found a buyer?

19:12.161 --> 19:16.671
You know about this and
you didn't try to stop it?

19:16.673 --> 19:18.688
What happened to
glory and honor?

19:18.690 --> 19:19.871
What happened to

19:19.873 --> 19:21.694
never taking our goat run.

19:21.696 --> 19:25.567
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

19:25.569 --> 19:27.872
It's time to stop fighting
what you are and accept

19:27.874 --> 19:29.760
your station, Elliot.

19:29.762 --> 19:30.723
Life's easier that way.

19:34.529 --> 19:36.959
You get Ignacio,
I'll get the goats.

19:36.961 --> 19:38.719
You wouldn't last
a day in the wild.

19:38.721 --> 19:41.216
Well, that's longer than
we'd last in a dehydrator.

19:41.218 --> 19:42.752
We're not running away, Hazel.

19:42.754 --> 19:44.095
Of course we're running away.

19:44.097 --> 19:45.410
What else could we possibly do?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.711
Are we about to commit a crime?

19:51.713 --> 19:52.896
It's a gray area.

19:52.898 --> 19:55.234
Because I've always thought
I'd make an excellent saboteur.

19:58.433 --> 20:02.399
Sabotage isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

20:05.793 --> 20:07.774
Mi,
mi, mi, mi, mi.

20:07.776 --> 20:10.015
Oh, what a DJing morning.

20:10.017 --> 20:12.736
Oh, what a DJing day.

20:12.738 --> 20:14.527
Everybody now.

20:14.529 --> 20:17.344
We've
got a DJing feeling.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.288
Everything's DJ today.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.623
You know, DJ's going
to miss you all when

20:22.625 --> 20:24.127
he's working with the big man.

20:24.129 --> 20:26.464
Aw, we're going
to miss you too, DJ.

20:26.466 --> 20:29.375
Oh, DJ didn't really mean it.

20:29.377 --> 20:31.968
He was just being polite.

20:31.970 --> 20:34.531
See you on the
other side, suckers.

20:42.114 --> 20:44.704
Shut that thing, Hazel.

20:44.706 --> 20:46.367
I'm serious, quiet.

20:46.369 --> 20:47.583
I'm trying.

20:47.585 --> 20:48.130
I'm trying.

20:50.977 --> 20:52.130
I think I got it this time.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.655
Purring like a kitten.

21:02.305 --> 21:03.935
What is the matter with you?

21:03.937 --> 21:06.304
It's no big deal, I just...

21:06.306 --> 21:07.550
uh.

21:07.552 --> 21:09.471
What is going on?

21:09.473 --> 21:13.443
I just maybe, probably, really
shouldn't have eaten that can.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.239
Third time's the charm.

21:20.706 --> 21:21.983
Yes.

21:21.985 --> 21:24.800
Now hurry up and get in
before she stalls again.

21:38.434 --> 21:40.384
Oh, make it stop.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.206
You look really bad.

21:42.208 --> 21:45.119
Got to get that can through
the old duodenum, you know?

21:45.121 --> 21:46.751
Um, no.

21:46.753 --> 21:48.352
You're right.

21:48.354 --> 21:49.920
Things could get messy,
cornering the small intestine.

21:49.922 --> 21:52.448
That's only happened a
couple of times in the past.

21:52.450 --> 21:53.312
What?

21:53.314 --> 21:53.823
All right, Sherlock.

21:53.825 --> 21:54.719
It was five times.

21:54.721 --> 21:55.615
OK, six.

21:55.617 --> 21:57.087
Fine, seven.

21:57.089 --> 21:59.327
I've had complications
in the small intestine

21:59.329 --> 22:02.143
as a result of ingesting
cans eight times in the past.

22:02.145 --> 22:04.031
But you never know how
things will shake out.

22:04.033 --> 22:08.031
A ruminants gastrointestinal
tract is full of surprises.

22:12.770 --> 22:15.614
What happened to the engine?

22:20.385 --> 22:23.231
We're going to have to
make an emergency landing.

22:23.233 --> 22:24.385
We're all going to die.

22:28.288 --> 22:29.695
What are you doing?

22:29.697 --> 22:31.521
Are you trying to
hit that tree, Coach?

22:37.792 --> 22:39.710
Hazel.

22:39.712 --> 22:41.312
Help me.

22:41.314 --> 22:43.295
Come on, Hazel.

22:43.297 --> 22:46.177
Reach.
Hazel.

22:53.153 --> 22:56.030
Wow, well how about that?

22:56.032 --> 22:57.215
What?

22:57.217 --> 23:00.896
That can just shook
itself right out.

23:32.256 --> 23:34.914
This is where reindeer
become heroes, boys.

23:42.082 --> 23:43.872
Nice ride.

23:43.874 --> 23:47.103
You make that thing out
of your grandpappy's old car

23:47.105 --> 23:49.407
and some salvage tractor parts?

23:49.409 --> 23:51.327
Yeah, why?

23:59.041 --> 24:01.470
I'm flying corporate
or nothing from now on.

24:01.472 --> 24:02.496
I am not even kidding.

24:02.498 --> 24:04.190
Oh, nibbles.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.215
Let's chow.

24:05.217 --> 24:06.815
No, forget it.

24:06.817 --> 24:08.671
We have to register while
the others are distracted.

24:08.673 --> 24:10.559
Not even a carrot?

24:10.561 --> 24:11.775
Come on.

24:11.777 --> 24:14.591
I'm so hungry.

24:14.593 --> 24:15.775
Whoohoo.

24:15.777 --> 24:18.019
That's my boys.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.991
Walter Wittick III, right?

24:24.993 --> 24:26.239
Do I know you?

24:26.241 --> 24:27.711
I don't think so.

24:27.713 --> 24:30.242
Cause you look exactly
like my next girlfriend.

24:33.793 --> 24:35.456
I'm Walter Wittick, yes.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.598
Oh yeah, you're the
team from the petting

24:37.600 --> 24:39.551
zoo, the Witty Bitty Farm.

24:39.553 --> 24:41.727
Wittick's Reindeer
Training Camp, actually.

24:41.729 --> 24:43.039
We're rebranding.

24:43.041 --> 24:45.022
Aren't you some
kind of minor league

24:45.024 --> 24:46.464
baseball star or something?

24:46.466 --> 24:48.414
Youngest shortstop
ever drafted.

24:48.416 --> 24:50.079
Ooh, impressive.

24:50.081 --> 24:53.024
I bet you'll be called up
to the majors any day now.

24:53.026 --> 24:54.943
Oh, yeah.

24:54.945 --> 24:57.183
Major league baseball isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

24:57.185 --> 24:59.774
I decided to do something
important with my life,

24:59.776 --> 25:02.944
something truly fulfilling,
you know, for the kids.

25:02.946 --> 25:04.671
How noble.

25:04.673 --> 25:06.816
That's just the
kind of guy I am,

25:06.818 --> 25:09.408
noble, magnanimous, benevolent.

25:09.410 --> 25:10.526
I could go on.

25:10.528 --> 25:12.031
I'm sure you could.

25:12.033 --> 25:14.239
The thing is I heard
you got sidelined

25:14.241 --> 25:15.838
by a case of the yips.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.768
What?

25:16.770 --> 25:19.008
Word is you woke up
one day and completely

25:19.010 --> 25:21.758
lost your ability to throw
the ball to first base.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.807
Poof, like you
never had it at all.

25:23.809 --> 25:25.343
That's not... where did you...

25:25.345 --> 25:27.614
I mean, OK, also
dude, the yips is

25:27.616 --> 25:29.216
not the preferred nomenclature.

25:29.218 --> 25:31.615
Misplaced focus, please.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.407
You couldn't hit a ball
10 feet in front of you

25:33.409 --> 25:34.208
to save your life.

25:34.210 --> 25:36.414
That only happened
the one time.

25:36.416 --> 25:38.303
Sure it did.

25:38.305 --> 25:40.286
Good like out there, sport star.

25:40.288 --> 25:44.767
That could have gone better.

25:44.769 --> 25:47.103
Oh man, this is perfect.

25:47.105 --> 25:48.064
Everyone in the world
is going to want

25:48.066 --> 25:49.950
to visit the petting zoo
that produced Santa's

25:49.952 --> 25:52.255
first non-reindeer reindeer.

25:52.257 --> 25:53.759
Coach will make
so much money, he

25:53.761 --> 25:55.614
won't have to sell us anymore.

25:55.616 --> 25:58.590
And all you have to do is
beat 20 of the world's toughest

25:58.592 --> 26:00.480
contenders in a
grueling three-day

26:00.482 --> 26:02.754
- competition to make it happen.
- Next.

26:06.976 --> 26:07.838
Where's your human?

26:07.840 --> 26:10.431
He's busy in the...
uh, you know what?

26:10.433 --> 26:12.096
I'd look to check
in a player, please.

26:12.098 --> 26:14.336
I'm only permitted
to deal with humans.

26:14.338 --> 26:15.232
It's a union thing.

26:15.234 --> 26:16.159
His name's Elliot.

26:16.161 --> 26:16.993
That is E-L-L-I-O-T-E?

26:20.065 --> 26:22.047
At least, I think
there's an E on the end.

26:22.049 --> 26:23.902
Literacy's never really
been my strong point.

26:23.904 --> 26:25.248
Seriously, g get your human.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.943
He's allergic to tree nuts.

26:26.945 --> 26:28.894
Best to take it easy
on the dairy, too.

26:28.896 --> 26:31.551
Since you're obviously
never going to leave, fine.

26:31.553 --> 26:33.439
Name and feeder farm
before I change my mind.

26:33.441 --> 26:34.272
Yeah.

26:34.274 --> 26:36.320
So again, his name
is Elliot, and we

26:36.322 --> 26:37.919
are an independent entry.

26:37.921 --> 26:39.839
You got a wild card then?

26:39.841 --> 26:42.655
Did I mention he
has a nut allergy?

26:42.657 --> 26:44.352
I'll take that as a no.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.664
Once you see what he can do...

26:45.666 --> 26:47.295
Oh, for the love of Keebler.

26:47.297 --> 26:51.806
If it will hurry you up,
show me this player of yours.

26:51.808 --> 26:54.814
Tada.

26:54.816 --> 26:57.024
You want to enter a pony
in the North Pole tryouts?

26:57.026 --> 26:58.753
- I am a miniature...
- Next.

27:03.234 --> 27:04.704
What are we
going to do, Hazel?

27:04.706 --> 27:07.167
If I can't register,
I can't compete.

27:07.169 --> 27:07.840
No, no, no.

27:07.842 --> 27:10.560
It's all big misunderstanding.

27:10.562 --> 27:13.440
We warned you about the extra
magic cookies, Moshennika.

27:13.442 --> 27:15.327
Gentlemen, be reasonable.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.758
I'm sure we can work this out.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.160
Bribing Santa's helpers, Uri.

27:20.162 --> 27:23.486
Ugh, how do you sleep at night?

27:23.488 --> 27:24.417
Enjoy the naughty list.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.703
Ooh.

27:28.705 --> 27:31.744
Ah, Hazel, you don't
even know what that is.

27:31.746 --> 27:33.951
Blech, ugh.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.151
Standard 65 pound cardstock
flavored with number 12 ink?

27:37.153 --> 27:39.454
I'm number 12 ink intolerant.

27:39.456 --> 27:39.871
What?

27:39.873 --> 27:42.334
It's a thing.

27:42.336 --> 27:45.695
Hazel, you are a genius.

27:45.697 --> 27:46.911
I know.

27:46.913 --> 27:47.586
What's it say?

27:51.233 --> 27:52.895
Follow me.

27:52.897 --> 27:54.624
Can you just read it to me?

27:54.626 --> 27:55.391
Mm.

27:55.393 --> 27:56.319
Mm.

27:56.321 --> 27:57.215
Mm.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.590
Mhm.

27:58.592 --> 28:00.739
This is some quality produce.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.834
Hello, Junior.

28:08.513 --> 28:11.489
Oh, hey dad.

28:12.478 --> 28:13.728
Didn't realize you'd
make it to the tryouts.

28:13.730 --> 28:16.703
How are things
with the Brittle...

28:16.705 --> 28:18.814
what's that place called again?

28:18.816 --> 28:21.599
Wittick's Witty Bitty
Farm, which you'd know

28:21.601 --> 28:24.288
if you ever bothered to visit.

28:24.290 --> 28:25.504
Yes.

28:25.506 --> 28:28.002
Well, oh dear.

28:31.552 --> 28:32.449
Good luck, son.

28:35.809 --> 28:37.310
Oh and Junior...

28:37.312 --> 28:38.911
Yeah dad?

28:38.913 --> 28:40.578
Try not to embarrass me, OK?

28:48.929 --> 28:52.063
- Say hello to Glitzen.
- Glitzen?

28:52.065 --> 28:54.078
What kind of a name is Glitzen?

28:54.080 --> 28:56.607
Weren't you just here?

28:56.609 --> 28:58.111
Are you going to
sign us in or do I have

28:58.113 --> 28:59.582
to go over your head on this?

28:59.584 --> 29:01.694
Ahem.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.296
Do we have a problem
here, Joleen?

29:03.298 --> 29:05.407
This goat's
pulling a fast one.

29:05.409 --> 29:07.070
I've got a wild card
and I've got a player.

29:07.072 --> 29:09.343
How is that a fast one?

29:09.345 --> 29:10.049
This is your player?

29:13.472 --> 29:14.494
We're blown.

29:14.496 --> 29:15.775
- He knows.
- He doesn't know.

29:15.777 --> 29:18.174
- Stop talking.
- He totally knows.

29:18.176 --> 29:19.519
Go ahead, sign him in.

29:19.521 --> 29:20.415
What?

29:20.417 --> 29:21.951
He's below regulation
weight and height.

29:21.953 --> 29:24.350
He doesn't have a human,
and I'm almost positive I

29:24.352 --> 29:26.783
checked in all the wild cards.

29:26.785 --> 29:29.568
Who gives the
orders around here?

29:29.570 --> 29:31.199
You do, sir.

29:31.201 --> 29:34.910
Then sign him in.

29:34.912 --> 29:35.935
Thanks.

29:35.937 --> 29:37.982
It's going to be a long day.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.201
I knew I shouldn't have
picked up this shift.

29:43.904 --> 29:45.023
I guess we should
try to find out

29:45.025 --> 29:46.943
who your main competition is.

29:46.945 --> 29:49.823
Oh, oh DJ all the way.

29:49.825 --> 29:51.904
Ugh, aside from the obvious.

29:51.906 --> 29:54.175
Oh, I already know.

29:54.177 --> 29:55.614
There's Heinrich
the Dutch Dream.

29:55.616 --> 29:57.183
Oh [INAUDIBLE]

29:57.185 --> 29:59.232
Svetlana the Polish
Punisher and her best friend,

29:59.234 --> 30:02.112
Olga the Swedish Destroyer.

30:02.114 --> 30:04.415
Then we've got the
Canadian, a.k.a.

30:04.417 --> 30:06.175
- Sasha Second Place.
- Ouch.

30:06.177 --> 30:07.872
Watch it, Dutch boy.

30:07.874 --> 30:08.895
Dang.

30:08.897 --> 30:10.400
What is her problem?

30:10.402 --> 30:12.063
Huge chip on her shoulder.

30:12.065 --> 30:14.751
Dad, grandma, and great
uncle all second picks

30:14.753 --> 30:16.574
at previous tryouts.

30:16.576 --> 30:18.367
Lot of pressure to
break the family curse.

30:18.369 --> 30:21.023
All right,
everybody, pipe down.

30:21.025 --> 30:24.062
Ahem, welcome, one and all.

30:24.064 --> 30:26.112
Santa is delighted you
made the long journey

30:26.114 --> 30:28.190
and is blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

30:28.192 --> 30:29.695
OK, here's the deal.

30:29.697 --> 30:33.536
We've got three days to
find our next Blitzen.

30:33.538 --> 30:35.359
Of course, when we
set up this system,

30:35.361 --> 30:38.847
we envisioned a
much longer process.

30:38.849 --> 30:41.534
But since your predecessor
proved like so many before him

30:41.536 --> 30:43.774
that reindeer are
unreliable, self-absorbed,

30:43.776 --> 30:46.016
ego maniacal
quitters who possess

30:46.018 --> 30:48.447
nary a hint of
social responsibility

30:48.449 --> 30:49.374
nor personal honor...

30:49.376 --> 30:50.334
Who do you think you are?

30:51.200 --> 30:52.671
Not all reindeer, man.

30:52.673 --> 30:54.270
This guy is amazing.

30:54.272 --> 30:55.999
Oh, I see.

30:56.001 --> 30:59.007
You're under the impression that
reindeers are noble creatures.

30:59.009 --> 31:00.542
Hey, I've got a good idea.

31:00.544 --> 31:03.326
How about I enlighten you to
the way things really are?

31:03.328 --> 31:08.703
It all started in 1953 when
Dixen decided to have a family

31:08.705 --> 31:10.431
and move to the suburbs.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.223
Now, I'll be the first to admit
the Dixen thing caught us off

31:12.225 --> 31:13.950
guard.

31:13.952 --> 31:16.159
Of course, our real mistake was
thinking that it was a fluke.

31:16.161 --> 31:18.782
Because 14 years later, along
comes a little movement known

31:18.784 --> 31:21.727
as "flower power,"
and Comet takes off

31:21.729 --> 31:24.863
to some ashram to find himself.

31:24.865 --> 31:28.351
Then in 1988, Cupid
defected to Moscow

31:28.353 --> 31:31.263
after falling in
love again, this time

31:31.265 --> 31:34.047
with a little Siberian number
by the name of Vladlena,

31:34.049 --> 31:37.407
on Christmas Eve, no
less, which brings us

31:37.409 --> 31:40.319
to last year's incident
when Prancer decided

31:40.321 --> 31:42.942
he needed some "me" time.

31:42.944 --> 31:46.078
I mean, have you ever heard
such self-absorbed baloney

31:46.080 --> 31:47.391
in all your life?

31:47.393 --> 31:47.935
Oh, wait.

31:47.937 --> 31:50.271
Look who I'm talking to.

31:50.273 --> 31:51.615
Of course you have.

31:51.617 --> 31:52.414
Wait a minute.

31:52.416 --> 31:53.727
Are you kidding me?

31:53.729 --> 31:58.015
Save your whining for
the sports psychologist.

31:58.017 --> 32:01.534
The point is, punks, it's
no longer just about skill.

32:01.536 --> 32:05.247
We're looking for strength of
character, integrity, loyalty,

32:05.249 --> 32:07.166
qualities that seemed to
have eluded your species

32:07.168 --> 32:09.502
for quite some time.

32:09.504 --> 32:10.943
Now, get out of here.

32:10.945 --> 32:13.566
First event starts in
the main field in five.

32:26.401 --> 32:28.734
Oh, oh DJ all the way.

32:28.736 --> 32:32.479
Hey, hey DJ all the way.

32:32.481 --> 32:34.526
Hm.

32:34.528 --> 32:39.230
Hey, Little League tryouts
were last week, small fry.

32:39.232 --> 32:39.934
Good one.

32:39.936 --> 32:40.702
Question, though.

32:40.704 --> 32:42.207
Are you looking
forward to coming

32:42.209 --> 32:44.511
in second again, JD Canuck?

32:44.513 --> 32:46.335
Oh.

32:46.337 --> 32:47.231
No, no, I'm sorry.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.414
I didn't mean that.

32:48.416 --> 32:49.182
I was only trying to...

32:49.184 --> 32:50.878
I'm just messing
with you, tiny.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.382
Would you two keep it down?

32:52.384 --> 32:54.657
DJ's trying to get himself
in the zone over here.

33:00.448 --> 33:01.662
All right, folks.

33:01.664 --> 33:04.478
This ain't rocket science.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.687
First 10 get to stick
around for tomorrow's event.

33:06.689 --> 33:09.407
The rest of you, bye bye.

33:09.409 --> 33:09.890
Take your marks.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.591
Go DJ, go.

33:18.593 --> 33:23.074
- Wind up your knees, head down.
- Huh?

33:36.577 --> 33:40.126
This is just another goat run.

33:40.128 --> 33:42.974
Come on, Glitzen,
you can do this.

33:42.976 --> 33:44.894
You do this every day.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.622
Duck and weave, Glitzen.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.062
What?

33:48.064 --> 33:49.409
Duck and weave.

33:55.713 --> 33:57.630
Look at DJ go.

33:57.632 --> 34:00.254
Those clowns never had a chance.

34:00.256 --> 34:02.142
Enough of this nonsense.

34:02.144 --> 34:05.118
There's a footy match against
the old enemy on channel 3.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.751
Hey.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.263
Did somebody order
a Spanish meatball?

34:18.208 --> 34:20.415
Get out of there, Glitzen.
Go.

34:20.417 --> 34:22.975
Move.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.801
Oh my goat.

34:29.376 --> 34:29.857
What?

34:33.024 --> 34:36.607
That little reindeer looks
just like you, Peanutbutter.

34:36.609 --> 34:42.237
- [INAUDIBLE]
- He's got it.

34:42.239 --> 34:43.167
He's got it.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.382
Yeah.

34:44.384 --> 34:45.982
Yes.
Yes.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.870
DJ loves himself.

34:47.871 --> 34:49.277
DJ.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.143
You see that?

34:50.145 --> 34:52.797
The training camp
is going to pay off.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.621
Man, your boy's got some legs.

34:54.623 --> 34:56.799
He just broke your
record, right?

34:56.801 --> 34:57.633
Not even close.

35:09.152 --> 35:10.111
Yes, yes.

35:10.113 --> 35:11.873
[INAUDIBLE] in your face.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.295
Elliot, that was amazing.

35:19.297 --> 35:21.887
Can you believe it, Hazel?

35:21.889 --> 35:22.528
I did it.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.479
I actually made it through.

35:24.481 --> 35:25.566
What are you two doing here?

35:25.568 --> 35:27.903
Uh-oh.

35:27.905 --> 35:29.470
Do we know each other?

35:29.472 --> 35:31.487
I'm pretty sure
we've met, Elliot.

35:31.489 --> 35:32.702
Nice hat, Hazel.

35:32.704 --> 35:34.910
Please don't tell
Coach we're here, Clyde.

35:34.912 --> 35:37.310
Give me one good
reason why not.

35:37.312 --> 35:39.422
Because I can do this.

35:39.424 --> 35:40.350
Did you see that?

35:40.352 --> 35:41.311
I made the cut.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.199
Dead last on qualifier.

35:43.201 --> 35:44.862
You must be so proud.

35:44.864 --> 35:46.911
OK, yeah, I was last.

35:46.913 --> 35:48.095
But did you see me out there?

35:48.097 --> 35:49.439
I was on fire.

35:49.441 --> 35:51.614
Sloppy footwork,
appalling technique,

35:51.616 --> 35:54.495
and a total disregard
for presentation.

35:54.497 --> 35:55.486
Some fire.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.351
Yeah?

35:56.353 --> 35:58.173
Well, what do you know?

35:58.175 --> 36:00.063
You're just a cranky, old draft
horse whose pulled one too many

36:00.065 --> 36:02.111
kegs.

36:02.113 --> 36:03.390
Forget I said anything.

36:03.392 --> 36:04.801
You'll make a perfect reindeer.

36:07.905 --> 36:09.762
OK, time to hit the buffet.

36:15.937 --> 36:18.685
Uh, we should just
go home and take

36:18.687 --> 36:20.543
our chances with the meat lady.

36:20.545 --> 36:21.663
Oh yeah, sure.

36:21.665 --> 36:23.967
Let's quit now, give
up on everything

36:23.969 --> 36:25.758
you've been working
your entire life for.

36:25.760 --> 36:26.431
Great plan.

36:26.433 --> 36:27.454
I'm serious.

36:27.456 --> 36:29.538
Sure you are.
Athletes.

36:31.937 --> 36:33.022
Wait a second.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.807
Where is everyone?

36:35.809 --> 36:37.534
Hey, Glitzen.

36:37.536 --> 36:39.358
You coming to the after party?

36:39.360 --> 36:41.118
Ooh, is that where
they serve dessert?

36:41.120 --> 36:42.302
Is there a chocolate fountain?

36:42.304 --> 36:44.670
Reindeer only, sorry.

36:44.672 --> 36:46.463
I'm not really
in a party mood.

36:46.465 --> 36:47.390
Why not?

36:47.392 --> 36:49.886
You were amazing today.

36:49.888 --> 36:50.367
I was?

36:50.369 --> 36:51.455
Are you kidding?

36:51.457 --> 36:52.893
I just saw the replay.

36:52.895 --> 36:55.711
That duck and weave
bit was awesome.

36:55.713 --> 36:56.670
Oh, actually, that was...

36:56.672 --> 36:59.359
Just a little reindeer
move I came up with back

36:59.361 --> 37:01.375
at the reindeer
training camp, you

37:01.377 --> 37:03.870
know with the other
reindeer, like me.

37:03.872 --> 37:04.798
Excuse me?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.271
Well, come on then.

37:06.273 --> 37:08.286
Don't just stand
there looking short.

37:08.288 --> 37:10.046
OK, yeah.

37:10.048 --> 37:11.231
Yeah, you're right, Sasha.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.374
A party sounds
like a great idea.

37:13.376 --> 37:14.272
Enjoy the buffet, Hazel.

37:20.096 --> 37:22.815
So this is like a
Christmas party?

37:22.817 --> 37:25.054
Um, not exactly.

37:25.056 --> 37:27.295
Younglings, welcome.

37:27.297 --> 37:30.782
We've got food,
beverages, flea dip.

37:30.784 --> 37:34.366
Um, is that the North Pole?

37:34.368 --> 37:35.485
Yeah.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.151
We steal it every year.

37:37.153 --> 37:39.039
What's that stuff all over it?

37:39.041 --> 37:39.837
Butter.

37:39.839 --> 37:43.999
- Makes it good and slippery.
- Oh.

37:44.001 --> 37:45.759
You two want to give it a try?

37:45.761 --> 37:48.382
Do we have a choice?

37:48.384 --> 37:51.935
What do you think we are, a
couple of heartless monsters?

37:51.937 --> 37:54.559
Because you would be right.

37:54.561 --> 37:55.775
Come on now.

37:55.777 --> 37:56.702
Come on.

37:56.704 --> 37:58.591
Have fun, y'all.

38:18.368 --> 38:19.518
Huh?

38:19.520 --> 38:20.670
Come on, come on.

38:20.672 --> 38:21.950
Where is it?

38:21.952 --> 38:23.521
I know I saw it
around here somewhere.

38:39.711 --> 38:41.345
That must be where
we get the dessert.

38:44.416 --> 38:46.303
Man, are you kidding me?

38:46.305 --> 38:48.094
No one can win this thing.

38:48.096 --> 38:49.439
Seriously, where's
an opposable thumb

38:49.441 --> 38:51.166
when you need it?

38:51.168 --> 38:52.893
No one can win.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.013
No one.

38:58.592 --> 39:00.350
Dude, speak English.

39:00.352 --> 39:02.749
You know DJ doesn't
understand Korean.

39:02.751 --> 39:03.934
He's Dutch, you idiot.

39:03.936 --> 39:05.629
Hey, I know what to do.

39:05.631 --> 39:08.478
I think DJ knows Korean
when he hears it, Sasha.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.077
Listen, I have an idea.

39:10.079 --> 39:11.518
No, she is right.
I am Dutch.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.038
Guys, we're all losers.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.254
Excuse me?

39:16.256 --> 39:17.661
You said it yourself, DJ.

39:17.663 --> 39:19.678
This is impossible.

39:19.680 --> 39:23.039
But if someone doesn't get
that hat down, we all lose.

39:23.041 --> 39:26.974
All of us as a group.

39:26.976 --> 39:30.078
Some might even call it a team.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.638
Do you see where
I'm going with this?

39:32.640 --> 39:34.271
Oh, I see.

39:34.273 --> 39:36.126
Let's do this.

39:37.919 --> 39:39.294
Whoa, hold on.

39:39.296 --> 39:41.184
What just... I don't get it.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.934
Are you wearing
[INAUDIBLE] shoes, man?

39:47.936 --> 39:49.533
Ow.
Ow.

39:49.535 --> 39:50.209
Watch it.

40:02.848 --> 40:05.631
Oh man, I love
being a reindeer.

40:05.633 --> 40:07.870
Good to know,
considering you've

40:07.872 --> 40:09.823
been one your entire life.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.421
Oh yeah, right.

40:11.423 --> 40:14.943
No, I'm just saying being
a reindeer is awesome.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.574
Whoa, hold up.

40:16.576 --> 40:19.357
Do I know you, little dude?

40:19.359 --> 40:20.223
Me?

40:20.225 --> 40:21.566
No.

40:21.568 --> 40:23.870
No, we just met, remember?

40:23.872 --> 40:26.781
Yeah, but you're
looking awfully

40:26.783 --> 40:29.214
familiar all of a sudden.

40:29.216 --> 40:30.943
Oh, is that my
coach calling me?

40:30.945 --> 40:31.617
I should go.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.870
That was weird.

40:35.872 --> 40:36.990
Something's not right, Sasha.

40:36.992 --> 40:38.208
I know it.

40:45.504 --> 40:48.509
Oh wow.

40:48.511 --> 40:50.494
Oh my goodness.

40:50.496 --> 40:52.960
Oh, the kitchen must be behind
all these shiny new sleighs.

41:09.409 --> 41:11.293
What are you doing back here?

41:12.864 --> 41:15.423
Oh hello, good sir.

41:15.425 --> 41:18.846
Would you be so kind as to
direct me to the ladies room?

41:18.848 --> 41:20.959
So sorry, Madam, I cannot.

41:20.961 --> 41:23.551
Because you're a goat.

41:23.553 --> 41:25.662
You're not authorized
to be here, either.

41:25.664 --> 41:28.478
Would someone please
tell me what is going on?

41:28.480 --> 41:31.039
Sugar plum, there you are.

41:31.041 --> 41:33.533
I've been looking
all over for you.

41:33.535 --> 41:36.093
I've got a bag of dog treats
in my purse if you play along.

41:36.095 --> 41:38.239
Lady, do I look
like I eat Kibble?

41:38.241 --> 41:39.806
My, my, Lemon Drop.

41:39.808 --> 41:41.022
What is all this?

41:41.024 --> 41:43.807
It's how the North Pole keeps
up with the rest of the world.

41:43.809 --> 41:45.566
And it's supposed to be
top secret, by the way,

41:45.568 --> 41:47.966
so if you do not mind.

41:47.968 --> 41:52.159
It's just there sure a lot
of mechanical sleigh in here.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.141
Seriously, this
place is packed.

41:54.143 --> 41:56.351
And I always thought they
were manufactured exclusively

41:56.353 --> 41:57.918
for the training farms.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.037
Oh yeah, that is right.

41:59.039 --> 42:00.157
They sure are.

42:00.159 --> 42:03.263
And yet here we stand in
the heart of the North Pole,

42:03.265 --> 42:05.661
surrounded by a
veritable suite of them.

42:05.663 --> 42:06.911
Hey, she's right.

42:06.913 --> 42:08.159
What gives, elf?

42:08.161 --> 42:10.013
Care to comment?

42:10.015 --> 42:11.678
Well, I...

42:11.680 --> 42:13.853
I suppose we couldn't expect
to keep it a secret forever.

42:13.855 --> 42:15.391
Keep what a secret?

42:15.393 --> 42:18.430
How we survived the
Prancer crisis, of course.

42:18.432 --> 42:21.310
How do you think Santa handled
a typhoon, two blizzards,

42:21.312 --> 42:23.550
and the worst fog the
eastern seaboard had ever

42:23.552 --> 42:25.374
seen with his team down a man?

42:25.376 --> 42:28.670
Everyone knows last year
was an outright disaster.

42:28.672 --> 42:30.718
The one thing Santa
didn't do was handle it.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.214
Of course he handled it.

42:33.216 --> 42:36.478
He was just a little late.

42:36.480 --> 42:38.782
A little?

42:38.784 --> 42:40.351
Try seven hours.

42:41.216 --> 42:43.678
The candy
cane has cracked.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.077
I repeat, the candy
cane has cracked.

42:46.079 --> 42:49.886
Move, move, move.

42:49.888 --> 42:56.062
We did what we had to do
and we got the job done.

42:56.064 --> 42:59.422
These sleighs are
something else.

42:59.424 --> 43:01.758
No need to be fed or groomed.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.511
Don't need any
sleep or exercise.

43:04.513 --> 43:07.549
100% hassle-free.

43:07.551 --> 43:10.111
I love technology.

43:10.113 --> 43:13.277
Not more than you love
the reindeer, though, right?

43:13.279 --> 43:14.238
Oh yeah, no.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.766
Of course not.

43:16.768 --> 43:18.143
I love the reindeers.

43:18.145 --> 43:21.149
They're so much fun.

43:21.151 --> 43:23.773
So this is, what,
a backup system?

43:23.775 --> 43:24.541
Sure.

43:24.543 --> 43:25.566
OK.

43:25.568 --> 43:26.558
A backup system.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.542
That... that's a...

43:28.544 --> 43:30.782
a good phrase.

43:30.784 --> 43:31.968
Now, if you don't mind.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.990
He's a terrible liar.

43:36.992 --> 43:37.662
Yup.

43:37.664 --> 43:42.078
So how about those dog treats?

43:59.904 --> 44:03.071
Oh, you promised
you'd stop doing that.

44:03.073 --> 44:05.790
I saw something really
strange last night, Elliot.

44:05.792 --> 44:06.942
Last night.

44:06.944 --> 44:08.030
Oh, man.

44:08.032 --> 44:09.439
Lemon Drop's got
this secret lab.

44:09.441 --> 44:10.942
You should have
been there, Hazel.

44:10.944 --> 44:12.573
Full of mechanical sleighs.

44:12.575 --> 44:13.822
There was reindeer.

44:13.824 --> 44:14.943
I think he's up to something.

44:14.945 --> 44:16.541
And butter.

44:16.543 --> 44:18.654
Elliot, stop yapping
about the stupid reindeer

44:18.656 --> 44:20.030
and listen to me.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.534
Reindeer aren't stupid.

44:21.536 --> 44:23.166
Uh, excuse me?

44:23.168 --> 44:24.287
They're actually pretty great.

44:24.289 --> 44:25.822
They're great?

44:25.824 --> 44:28.958
I mean even DJ is OK
once you get to know him.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.238
OK, fine.

44:30.240 --> 44:34.398
Let's say they can be
nice to other reindeer.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.063
How do you think they're
going to react when

44:36.065 --> 44:38.270
you take off those antlers?

44:38.272 --> 44:40.286
Maybe I won't have to.

44:40.288 --> 44:42.079
What are you
even talking about?

44:42.081 --> 44:44.478
I just mean I
might not even win,

44:44.480 --> 44:48.573
so there's no point in worrying
about any of that right now.

44:48.575 --> 44:52.382
I have to get to the gym before
all the machines are taken.

44:52.384 --> 44:53.184
I'll see you later, Hazel.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.510
You don't look like a reindeer
ready for his first flight.

45:08.512 --> 45:13.086
DJ's got the sniffles,
and it's freezing out there.

45:13.088 --> 45:15.294
You're a reindeer, DJ.

45:15.296 --> 45:16.705
You're genetically
built for the cold.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.926
So that's it.

45:20.928 --> 45:24.445
After all our work, everything
Coach has done for you,

45:24.447 --> 45:27.453
you're going to throw
it all away over a cold?

45:27.455 --> 45:31.230
It is what it is, old man.

45:31.232 --> 45:34.430
I expect you on the
main field in 20 minutes.

45:41.119 --> 45:41.982
Excuse me.

45:41.984 --> 45:43.902
OK, big guy, make some room.

45:43.904 --> 45:47.933
OK, if you could just move your
giant butt two inches to the...

45:47.935 --> 45:49.693
OK, all right, that's it.

45:49.695 --> 45:50.496
I am done playing.

46:01.375 --> 46:03.648
Ooh, look at that.
Nice.

46:11.105 --> 46:12.637
Yo, Malik.

46:12.639 --> 46:13.568
You forgot the milk.

46:22.335 --> 46:23.583
Well, well, well.

46:23.585 --> 46:26.366
Look at you, my lovelies.

46:26.368 --> 46:28.990
Gee, I wonder what
that sign says.

46:28.992 --> 46:32.893
Meh, how important could it be?

46:32.895 --> 46:35.934
Reading is overrated.

46:35.936 --> 46:37.470
He's sick.

46:37.472 --> 46:38.717
After everything
we've worked for?

46:38.719 --> 46:41.662
No, no, no, no, no.

46:41.664 --> 46:44.733
He wouldn't get up
for you, either?

46:44.735 --> 46:46.623
This can't be happening.

46:46.625 --> 46:48.895
Everything OK, gentlemen?

46:48.897 --> 46:50.046
Great.

46:50.048 --> 46:52.253
I can see the headline now,
number 1 seed has the yips.

46:52.255 --> 46:55.678
Reindeer trainer slash failed
baseball star loses everything.

46:55.680 --> 46:56.381
Perfect.

46:56.383 --> 46:58.718
That's actually
a little wordy.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.902
What am I going to do?

47:00.895 --> 47:01.630
You're right.

47:01.632 --> 47:02.622
He's fine.

47:02.624 --> 47:03.614
It's going to be totally fine.

47:03.616 --> 47:04.797
It's all fine.

47:04.799 --> 47:06.333
Sure sounds like it.

47:06.335 --> 47:09.246
I need some air.

47:09.248 --> 47:11.839
Your boy's wound a
little tight, huh?

47:11.841 --> 47:12.832
You have no idea.

47:15.776 --> 47:16.640
Hairpin turn.

47:41.183 --> 47:44.253
Candy canes.

47:44.255 --> 47:47.070
Keep your knees in
line with your hooves.

47:47.072 --> 47:48.958
Are you talking to me?

47:48.960 --> 47:50.622
You see anybody else
wrecking the field

47:50.624 --> 47:51.774
with their sloppy technique?

47:51.776 --> 47:54.653
It's not that bad.

47:54.655 --> 47:56.318
OK, fine.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.245
Maybe I am.

47:57.247 --> 47:59.904
Knees, hooves, try it.

48:08.735 --> 48:09.441
Try it again.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.304
Ha ha, eat that.

48:31.648 --> 48:34.014
Give it up, grandpa.

48:34.016 --> 48:35.678
DJ's done.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.270
Rest assured, your grandfather
would never have tolerated

48:38.272 --> 48:40.734
this kind of behavior.

48:40.736 --> 48:41.502
Get up, Junior.

48:41.504 --> 48:43.294
I can't, dad.

48:43.296 --> 48:44.381
I'm sick.

48:45.215 --> 48:46.398
Nonsense.

48:46.400 --> 48:48.573
- You're afraid of flying.
- Nuh-huh.

48:48.575 --> 48:50.111
DJ's not afraid of flying.

48:50.113 --> 48:51.617
DJ's not afraid of anything.

48:54.656 --> 48:57.950
OK, fine, but it's not
like I chose to be a wuss.

48:57.952 --> 48:59.581
What do you want me to do?

48:59.583 --> 49:03.518
The only way to overcome any
fear is to face it head on.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.853
How did I know you'd say that?

49:05.855 --> 49:09.182
I heard an extra cookie
or two never hurt, either.

49:09.184 --> 49:11.517
Huh?
An extra cookie?

49:11.519 --> 49:13.437
Isn't that kind of cheating?

49:13.439 --> 49:16.990
I warned you about
embarrassing me, Junior.

49:16.992 --> 49:18.142
OK, dad.

49:18.144 --> 49:21.886
Anything you say.

49:34.881 --> 49:38.813
Now, did everyone get one
of Mrs. Claus's cookies?

49:38.815 --> 49:43.709
Apparently, we had a mix-up
in this morning's count.

49:43.711 --> 49:45.949
Rookies.

49:45.951 --> 49:48.637
All right, hold on
to your butts, folks.

49:48.639 --> 49:51.456
These puppies don't
take long to kick in.

49:59.615 --> 50:01.214
Hello?

50:01.216 --> 50:02.849
Huh?

50:08.127 --> 50:09.214
Ignacio?

50:09.216 --> 50:11.102
What are you doing here?

50:11.104 --> 50:14.654
And why are you so small?

50:14.656 --> 50:18.462
What the... huh?

50:18.464 --> 50:22.270
What is
happening to me?

50:22.272 --> 50:25.405
I shouldn't have
eaten those cookies.

50:44.447 --> 50:45.984
I am ashamed.

50:54.015 --> 50:56.126
OK, OK, OK.

50:56.128 --> 50:58.686
There's got to be
another way out here.

50:58.688 --> 50:59.360
Aha.

51:13.088 --> 51:15.709
Wait, what?

51:15.711 --> 51:18.333
DJ?

51:18.335 --> 51:21.693
Is this actually happening?

51:21.695 --> 51:25.790
The chained monkey
flies at midnight.

51:25.792 --> 51:27.296
DJ's a cheat.

51:32.575 --> 51:34.941
Yes, I did it, finally.

51:34.943 --> 51:37.022
You're up, DJ.

51:37.024 --> 51:38.302
DJ?

51:38.304 --> 51:40.190
Last call for DJ.

51:40.192 --> 51:41.629
I can't believe this.

51:41.631 --> 51:42.205
He choked.

51:42.207 --> 51:44.062
He totally choked.

51:44.064 --> 51:45.758
This is a disaster.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.830
Well, looks like we have our
first disqualification, folks.

51:48.832 --> 51:49.693
Hold up.

51:49.695 --> 51:50.942
Hold up.
Hold up.

51:50.944 --> 51:53.088
- DJ right here.
- Yeah.

52:03.136 --> 52:04.190
Oh no.

52:04.192 --> 52:07.518
I'm going to barf.

52:25.247 --> 52:26.367
Yes.
Yes.

52:32.224 --> 52:35.101
You're up, Glitzen.

52:35.103 --> 52:38.685
Good luck trying to beat that.

52:38.687 --> 52:40.573
Come on, Blitzen.

52:40.575 --> 52:43.645
You can do it.

52:42.720 --> 52:45.118
OK, big dreamers dream big.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.944
Big dreamers dream big.

52:55.552 --> 52:58.113
Elliot, you won't
believe what I...

53:03.616 --> 53:06.176
That little guy's
got some moves.

53:24.736 --> 53:25.693
Thank you.

53:25.695 --> 53:28.253
Thank you so much.

53:28.255 --> 53:31.582
No one puts DJ in the corner.

53:31.584 --> 53:32.958
Nice work, Glitzen.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.397
Oh, thanks, Sasha.

53:34.399 --> 53:35.230
I appreciate that.

53:35.232 --> 53:37.469
Yeah, well, enjoy
it while you can.

53:37.471 --> 53:40.637
I plan on eviscerating
you tomorrow.

53:40.639 --> 53:43.902
Um, what happened
to your antlers?

53:43.904 --> 53:46.621
They're all wonky.

53:49.534 --> 53:49.981
Hold up.

53:49.983 --> 53:50.525
Hold up.

53:50.527 --> 53:51.711
What's she doing here?

53:55.456 --> 53:58.493
I knew there was something
off about that little dude.

53:58.495 --> 54:01.053
The jig is up, goat.

54:01.055 --> 54:03.166
You two fraudsters
have been caught.

54:03.168 --> 54:04.158
You're one to talk.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.213
You're a cheater.

54:05.215 --> 54:06.622
What did you just call me?

54:06.624 --> 54:08.861
You heard me,
you're a cheater.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.550
Oh, look at that.
I'm down.

54:15.552 --> 54:18.782
I'm finally... oh come on.

54:18.784 --> 54:22.557
Hazel, what's going on?

54:22.559 --> 54:25.278
What is that hideous creature?

54:25.280 --> 54:26.237
Oh man.

54:26.239 --> 54:29.182
Elliot, is that you?

54:29.184 --> 54:32.254
Glitzen?

54:32.256 --> 54:33.534
What's the deal, [INAUDIBLE]?

54:33.536 --> 54:35.902
You're trying to
pull one over on us?

54:35.904 --> 54:37.405
Did you know
about this, Walter?

54:37.407 --> 54:38.878
Me?
Of course not.

54:38.880 --> 54:43.774
Well, this is certainly a
first, a pony at the North Pole

54:43.776 --> 54:46.302
- tryouts.
- Hes' a miniature horse.

54:46.304 --> 54:47.965
And he's the least
of your problems.

54:47.967 --> 54:49.213
What's that supposed to mean?

54:49.215 --> 54:51.133
DJ is a cheater.

54:51.135 --> 54:51.741
I saw him.

54:51.743 --> 54:53.597
He ate two extra cookies.

54:53.599 --> 54:54.973
That is an
outrageous, slanderous,

54:54.975 --> 54:56.926
and egregious falsehood.

54:56.928 --> 54:59.581
DJ's never cheated
a day in his life.

54:59.583 --> 55:03.582
Then how come you're the
only reindeer still in the air?

55:03.584 --> 55:06.430
I think it's time DJ paid
a visit to the medical tent.

55:06.432 --> 55:08.605
OK, fine.

55:08.607 --> 55:12.221
DJ may have eaten an
extra cookie or two.

55:12.223 --> 55:14.109
But what's the big deal?

55:14.111 --> 55:15.966
As long as you find
someone to pull the sleigh,

55:15.968 --> 55:17.918
what's it matter how they do it?

55:17.920 --> 55:18.877
You're right.

55:18.879 --> 55:22.589
Why not let tiny horses
pretend to be reindeer?

55:22.591 --> 55:25.885
Or have reindeer ingest
controlled substances?

55:25.887 --> 55:27.485
Oh, here's a thought.

55:27.487 --> 55:29.758
Rather than leaving
presents for children,

55:29.760 --> 55:33.181
Santa just burglars
their homes instead.

55:33.183 --> 55:34.525
We'll increase our bottom
line and let the old man

55:34.527 --> 55:35.996
unleash his inner criminal.

55:35.998 --> 55:37.758
It's a win-win.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.740
Santa's got an inner criminal?

55:39.742 --> 55:41.725
Would one of you elves
please tell us humans

55:41.727 --> 55:43.709
what these animals are saying?

55:43.711 --> 55:46.141
They're letting
me down, as usual.

55:46.143 --> 55:48.350
Oh, sir.

55:48.352 --> 55:49.692
What a surprise.

55:49.694 --> 55:51.517
Tell me you've kept
the mechanical sleighs in

55:51.519 --> 55:53.276
good working order, Lemon Drop.

55:53.278 --> 55:55.230
Of course, sir, tip-top.

55:55.232 --> 55:55.997
Why?

55:55.999 --> 55:58.621
Because these
tryouts are over.

55:58.623 --> 56:00.221
I'm disqualifying
every one everyone

56:00.223 --> 56:02.172
and canceling all
further events.

56:02.174 --> 56:03.228
Sir, if I may.

56:03.230 --> 56:05.917
You may not.

56:05.919 --> 56:08.477
I know how hard you've
worked to make these tryouts

56:08.479 --> 56:10.142
a successful, old
friend, but this

56:10.144 --> 56:13.340
has been a long time coming.

56:13.342 --> 56:15.901
I love all of my reindeer,
but I can no longer

56:15.903 --> 56:18.684
allow personal attachments
to blind me to the reality

56:18.686 --> 56:20.285
of what they've become.

56:20.287 --> 56:22.013
Therefore, it is
with heavy heart

56:22.015 --> 56:24.413
that I have decided
to end my association

56:24.415 --> 56:27.774
with reindeer forever.

56:30.304 --> 56:33.536
We have to put the
children of the world first.

56:37.535 --> 56:39.389
You two ruin everything.

56:39.391 --> 56:41.724
Centuries of matches
down the drain.

56:41.726 --> 56:45.437
We've been working for
this for years, years.

56:45.439 --> 56:45.920
Quiet.

56:49.536 --> 56:52.285
No one is more shocked
by this than me.

56:52.287 --> 56:55.006
However, Santa has
made his decision

56:55.008 --> 56:57.084
and we must abide by his wishes.

56:57.086 --> 57:01.758
Now, if you'll excuse me, we
have preparations to make.

57:01.760 --> 57:05.662
Oh, and Merry Christmas.

57:05.664 --> 57:07.262
You did this.

57:07.264 --> 57:09.980
What am I supposed
to tell my kids?

57:09.982 --> 57:11.936
What kind of sicko
pretends to be a reindeer?

57:14.783 --> 57:15.648
Hang on.

57:25.567 --> 57:26.973
Oh.

57:26.975 --> 57:30.492
So that did not go the
way I thought it would.

57:30.494 --> 57:31.678
Oh.

57:31.680 --> 57:32.734
Well, how did you
expect things to go

57:32.736 --> 57:34.365
when you stole those cookies?

57:34.367 --> 57:37.021
It's not like there was a
sign on them saying not to...

57:37.023 --> 57:38.781
oh, reading.

57:38.783 --> 57:40.125
- Yeah.
- Oh.

57:40.127 --> 57:42.046
You ruined everything, Hazel.

57:42.048 --> 57:44.092
Did you see the way the reindeer
looked at me back there?

57:44.094 --> 57:46.141
Elliot, reindeer are jerks.

57:46.143 --> 57:48.669
They've always been jerks and
they always will be jerks.

57:48.671 --> 57:51.197
Even Santa understands
that, Santa.

57:51.199 --> 57:52.797
But they all hate me now.

57:52.799 --> 57:54.717
Oh, who cares what they think?

57:54.719 --> 57:56.350
Have you've forgotten
why we're here?

57:56.352 --> 57:58.110
To save our friends.

57:58.112 --> 57:59.484
As soon as we get
home, we'll round

57:59.486 --> 58:02.172
everyone up and hit the road.

58:02.174 --> 58:03.678
At least we've got each other.

58:03.680 --> 58:06.781
That's what counts, isn't it?

58:06.783 --> 58:10.108
Isn't it, Elliot?

58:10.110 --> 58:12.000
I don't anything anymore.

58:23.038 --> 58:23.327
Ow.

58:27.424 --> 58:31.102
I suppose you want a comment
from the idiot coach who

58:31.104 --> 58:33.821
somehow missed the fact
that he had not one, but two

58:33.823 --> 58:35.998
cheating players on his roster.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.556
Well, newsflash, I
got nothing for you.

58:38.558 --> 58:41.661
I actually wanted to
see how you were doing.

58:41.663 --> 58:43.326
Guess I got my answer.

58:43.328 --> 58:44.445
I'm sorry.

58:44.447 --> 58:46.014
I'm just...

58:46.016 --> 58:47.518
You could always go back
to baseball, you know?

58:47.520 --> 58:50.268
There are ways to
deal with a yi...

58:50.270 --> 58:52.092
misplaced focus.

58:52.094 --> 58:53.342
You were good.

58:53.344 --> 58:55.646
Not good enough.

58:55.648 --> 58:57.756
If it's important,
you'll find a way.

58:57.758 --> 58:58.300
If not...

58:58.302 --> 58:59.933
You'll find an excuse.

58:59.935 --> 59:03.453
Where have I heard that before?

59:03.455 --> 59:04.668
It's time to face facts.

59:04.670 --> 59:07.133
I failed baseball,
and now I'm going

59:07.135 --> 59:09.406
to lose the training camp, too.

59:09.408 --> 59:11.840
So you're giving
up, just like that?

59:15.295 --> 59:18.784
Good luck, Walter, with
whatever you decide to do.

59:39.838 --> 59:42.268
Elliot, I've been
looking all over for you.

59:42.270 --> 59:44.605
Come on, it's time to go.

59:44.607 --> 59:48.029
Coach, I'm so sorry.

59:48.031 --> 59:48.733
I didn't mean...

59:48.735 --> 59:49.600
Come on now, get.

59:53.342 --> 59:55.645
Thanks for getting back
to me, Ms. Ludzinka.

59:55.647 --> 59:57.564
What did I just say?

59:57.566 --> 59:59.582
I didn't mean you, Ms. Ludzinka.

59:59.584 --> 01:00:02.110
Listen, I just faxed you
the signed bill of sale,

01:00:02.112 --> 01:00:04.061
so you can pick up the
animals any time you like.

01:00:04.063 --> 01:00:05.308
- What?
- Sure.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.142
Tonight works.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:07.580
Tonight?

01:00:07.582 --> 01:00:09.757
And I changed my mind
about the reindeer.

01:00:09.759 --> 01:00:11.392
You can have them, too.

01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:19.549
So this is how it all ends
for me, abhorred in the Arctic,

01:00:19.551 --> 01:00:21.280
dehydrated in Duluth.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.932
I wish I could figure out
who gave DJ the cookies.

01:00:27.934 --> 01:00:29.244
You wouldn't happen to
know the answer to that,

01:00:29.246 --> 01:00:30.813
would you, Sugarplum?

01:00:30.815 --> 01:00:33.596
I sure do, a masked elf
with a bad wrist tattoo.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.430
I can't believe I'm
about to say this,

01:00:38.432 --> 01:00:39.808
but I really wish
I could speak goat.

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:44.732
How about you?

01:00:44.734 --> 01:00:46.205
Want to do an interview?

01:00:46.207 --> 01:00:48.061
Give my readers an elf's
perspective on the whole

01:00:48.063 --> 01:00:49.789
Santa quits the reindeer thing?

01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:51.389
My boss has
specifically forbidden

01:00:51.391 --> 01:00:53.053
us from talking to the press.

01:00:53.055 --> 01:00:54.845
It would be strictly
off the record.

01:00:54.847 --> 01:00:56.253
You don't get it.

01:00:56.255 --> 01:00:57.660
Things are so tight
around here, I

01:00:57.662 --> 01:00:59.550
can't drop a chocolate
kiss without Lemon

01:00:59.552 --> 01:01:00.317
Drop's permission.

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:01.596
You feel me?

01:01:01.598 --> 01:01:03.198
Ew.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.797
You mind?

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:05.533
Whatever.

01:01:05.535 --> 01:01:06.144
It's only food.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.884
The chained monkey
flies at midnight.

01:01:13.886 --> 01:01:14.432
You don't say?

01:01:17.022 --> 01:01:18.142
Come on, lady.

01:01:18.144 --> 01:01:20.032
It's time you learned
to speak goat.

01:01:24.671 --> 01:01:26.013
You do realize we're
at the North Pole

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.732
in the dead of winter, right?

01:01:28.734 --> 01:01:30.430
Your point is?

01:01:30.432 --> 01:01:35.581
Guys, where's Hazel?

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:37.021
We assumed she was with you.

01:01:37.023 --> 01:01:39.070
We have to find
her, right now.

01:01:39.072 --> 01:01:41.949
You're that anxious to get
back to your sad, little life,

01:01:41.951 --> 01:01:42.846
mini man?

01:01:42.848 --> 01:01:44.188
I won't have a life
to get back to if we

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:45.821
don't get home before sundown.

01:01:45.823 --> 01:01:47.645
None of us will.

01:01:47.647 --> 01:01:48.862
What are you talking about?

01:01:48.864 --> 01:01:50.877
I don't have time to explain.

01:01:50.879 --> 01:01:54.652
Then I suggest you make time.

01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:55.997
Green.

01:01:55.999 --> 01:01:57.020
Click the green.

01:01:57.022 --> 01:01:57.533
Click it.

01:01:57.535 --> 01:01:58.366
It's green.

01:01:58.368 --> 01:01:59.293
The green one.

01:01:59.295 --> 01:02:00.476
Unright.

01:02:00.478 --> 01:02:02.140
Unright the click.
Unright.

01:02:02.142 --> 01:02:03.262
I'm clicking.

01:02:03.264 --> 01:02:04.733
I'm clicking.

01:02:04.735 --> 01:02:07.805
Uh, have you ever even
used a computer before?

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.973
Never used mainframe
previous, although that now.

01:02:10.975 --> 01:02:12.765
Either this translation
program sucks,

01:02:12.767 --> 01:02:14.845
or you are completely insane.

01:02:14.847 --> 01:02:17.565
Listen lady, goat is a complex
language with multiple layers

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.782
of subtext.

01:02:18.784 --> 01:02:20.668
Of to fraulein.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.397
The complicated
tongue of the goat

01:02:22.399 --> 01:02:26.012
displays many floors
between the lines.

01:02:26.014 --> 01:02:27.932
She's going to
turn DJ into what?

01:02:27.934 --> 01:02:29.117
She's a monster.

01:02:29.119 --> 01:02:31.261
Goat, OK, I can see that.

01:02:31.263 --> 01:02:33.181
And a horse, well sure.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:35.869
But who'd eat a reindeer?

01:02:35.871 --> 01:02:36.670
Scandinavians.

01:02:36.672 --> 01:02:38.430
Scanda who now?

01:02:38.432 --> 01:02:40.893
You know, Nordic
countries, world's largest

01:02:40.895 --> 01:02:43.261
consumers of reindeer meat.

01:02:43.263 --> 01:02:45.948
They say reindeer is
healthier than fish,

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:50.972
low in fat, high in protein,
and apparently real, real tasty.

01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:52.860
Mm-mm.

01:02:52.862 --> 01:02:53.950
Oh.

01:02:53.952 --> 01:02:55.292
DJ don't feel so good.

01:02:55.294 --> 01:02:57.084
Guys, focus.

01:02:57.086 --> 01:03:00.670
Where is Hazel
most likely to be?

01:03:00.672 --> 01:03:03.453
Don't worry, reindeer's
barely a step above worm.

01:03:03.455 --> 01:03:06.077
This will be a piece of cake.

01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:09.213
Hey there, what
can I do you for?

01:03:09.215 --> 01:03:11.452
Hey there,
what can I do you for?

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.341
What did I tell you?

01:03:13.343 --> 01:03:16.126
Let's just cut to the
chase, my sunkissed friend.

01:03:16.128 --> 01:03:17.821
What's the deal with
the sudden retirement?

01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:22.973
That sounded important.

01:03:22.975 --> 01:03:24.509
It wasn't sudden.

01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:27.516
I dreamed of owning a
juice bar for years.

01:03:27.518 --> 01:03:29.533
So it was all your idea then?

01:03:29.535 --> 01:03:31.260
Nobody ordered you to go.

01:03:31.262 --> 01:03:33.564
Nobody like, say, Lemon Drop?

01:03:37.342 --> 01:03:38.493
Ordered me?

01:03:38.495 --> 01:03:39.389
Lemon Drop?

01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:40.861
No way.

01:03:40.863 --> 01:03:45.117
He's never been anything
but a 100% supportive.

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:47.836
Define supportive.

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:07.580
I can't find her anywhere.

01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:08.637
Well, we'll have to leave her.

01:04:08.639 --> 01:04:10.909
It's every animal for
themselves from here on it.

01:04:10.911 --> 01:04:12.636
What is this, the Thunderdome?

01:04:12.638 --> 01:04:13.215
We're not leaving anyone.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:20.701
Are we ready for the test
run of the sleighs, Lemon Drop?

01:04:20.703 --> 01:04:22.270
Just clearing the field, sir.

01:04:22.272 --> 01:04:26.300
Is Rusty all ready to go?

01:04:26.302 --> 01:04:27.452
He'll need a few minutes.

01:04:34.175 --> 01:04:35.869
Even a
state-of-the-art climate

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:36.672
generator needs to warm up.

01:04:39.647 --> 01:04:41.852
Are you sure
about this, Nicki?

01:04:41.854 --> 01:04:45.021
The reindeer has been such a big
part of your life for so long.

01:04:45.023 --> 01:04:46.652
The sleighs are
the future, Karina.

01:04:46.654 --> 01:04:48.541
At least they're
going to have to be.

01:04:48.543 --> 01:04:50.461
I just have this
nagging feeling

01:04:50.463 --> 01:04:52.030
we're missing something.

01:04:52.032 --> 01:04:52.924
Oh ho.

01:04:52.926 --> 01:04:54.176
Would you look at that?

01:05:05.182 --> 01:05:08.316
Can I get you two any
refreshments before we begin?

01:05:08.318 --> 01:05:10.908
Maybe some tea, cake perhaps?

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:13.469
Why not some
cookies, Lemon Drop?

01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:16.125
You seem to be pretty
good at giving those out.

01:05:16.127 --> 01:05:18.589
Am I supposed to understand
what you're talking about?

01:05:18.591 --> 01:05:19.165
Can it, elf.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.221
We know everything.

01:05:20.223 --> 01:05:21.565
Hazel, we have to go.

01:05:21.567 --> 01:05:22.717
- The meat lady...
- Shush.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:23.933
Not now, Elliot.

01:05:23.935 --> 01:05:25.660
What is going on here?

01:05:25.662 --> 01:05:27.676
Lemon Drop was
the one who supplied

01:05:27.678 --> 01:05:30.397
DJ with the extra cookies.

01:05:30.399 --> 01:05:32.188
That's absurd.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:35.133
I was here, working
my hands to the bone.

01:05:35.135 --> 01:05:37.917
You may have used Jolene
as your delivery girl,

01:05:37.919 --> 01:05:39.773
but the cookies came from you.

01:05:39.775 --> 01:05:41.788
Is this true, Lemon Drop?

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:43.261
That's not even
the half of it.

01:05:43.263 --> 01:05:44.575
Show him, Sugarplum.

01:05:47.007 --> 01:05:48.765
What are you doing, Hazel?

01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:49.533
Oh, nothing much.

01:05:49.535 --> 01:05:51.456
Just, you know,
saving Christmas.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.284
Lemon Drop found
me the real estate

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.108
listening for my juice bar.

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.381
He loaned me the money
for the down payment.

01:06:00.383 --> 01:06:02.749
The little guy even
helped me pack.

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:04.413
It's almost like
he knew I wanted

01:06:04.415 --> 01:06:07.292
a juice bar before I did.

01:06:07.294 --> 01:06:09.021
I mean that was just weird.

01:06:09.023 --> 01:06:11.933
The truth is Lemon Drop
orchestrated every reindeer

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:13.916
retirement since 1953.

01:06:13.918 --> 01:06:14.845
That's preposterous.

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:16.892
Cue the surveillance
footage, Sugarplum.

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:18.461
Surveillance footage?

01:06:18.463 --> 01:06:21.216
You use the naughty or
nice technology on us, too?

01:06:24.127 --> 01:06:25.404
I want kids.

01:06:25.406 --> 01:06:26.749
Of course I do.

01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:27.612
I just...

01:06:27.614 --> 01:06:29.372
Thought you could
put it off forever?

01:06:29.374 --> 01:06:32.829
Oh, honey, tick tock.
What?

01:06:32.831 --> 01:06:33.948
She was 503.

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:36.349
Am I wrong?

01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:39.453
But what about what
Comet wants, man?

01:06:39.455 --> 01:06:41.693
What about what Comet needs?

01:06:41.695 --> 01:06:43.453
You need to take some
time to figure out

01:06:43.455 --> 01:06:46.397
the answer to the most important
question of all, brother,

01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:49.053
who is Comet?

01:06:49.055 --> 01:06:50.972
That... that proves nothing.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:54.301
Passport, rubles, and a
one-way ticket to Moscow.

01:06:54.303 --> 01:06:56.189
Go get her, tiger.

01:06:56.191 --> 01:06:58.621
Wow, that was incredible.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.925
Oh, wait till I show
them the Prancer footage.

01:07:00.927 --> 01:07:02.461
Please don't.

01:07:02.463 --> 01:07:05.309
It's a super secret foot
race around the world.

01:07:05.311 --> 01:07:07.772
First contest to post a
selfie from every capitol city

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:11.292
and get 10 million likes wins.

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:12.572
YOLO.

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:14.749
Prancer still
hasn't come back.

01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:16.892
Oh, for heaven's sakes, I
was only trying to help you.

01:07:16.894 --> 01:07:21.180
By tricking me into throwing
away centuries of tradition?

01:07:21.182 --> 01:07:24.572
I want you gone by the end
of the day, Lemon Drop.

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:25.757
You, too, Jolene.

01:07:25.759 --> 01:07:26.748
OK.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:27.901
You're firing me?

01:07:27.903 --> 01:07:28.956
Go ahead.

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:32.573
But you'll see, the reindeer
will let you down again.

01:07:32.575 --> 01:07:34.397
The sleighs are the only
way to protect Christmas.

01:07:34.399 --> 01:07:37.212
They're the answer to
your problem, buddy.

01:07:37.214 --> 01:07:39.261
When did bringing joy to
the children of the world

01:07:39.263 --> 01:07:40.285
become a problem?

01:07:40.287 --> 01:07:42.876
When their population
reached almost a billion.

01:07:42.878 --> 01:07:45.949
How can one man and
eight dim-witted reindeer

01:07:45.951 --> 01:07:47.741
possibly be expected to keep up?

01:07:47.743 --> 01:07:49.404
Well, we've managed so far.

01:07:49.406 --> 01:07:52.700
Only because of me, me.

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.781
I'm the one who
manages logistics.

01:07:54.783 --> 01:07:56.028
I'm the one who
oversees production.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:58.332
I'm the one who
updates technology.

01:07:58.334 --> 01:08:00.060
Me.

01:08:00.062 --> 01:08:05.340
The only reason you can pull off
any of this is because of me.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:08.124
Lemon Drop, what
are you doing?

01:08:16.639 --> 01:08:20.412
Let's see how your precious
reindeer hold up to this.

01:08:20.415 --> 01:08:21.344
No.

01:08:32.639 --> 01:08:36.444
Everybody take cover.

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:47.357
Nicholas, where are you going?

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.781
Have to turn off machine.

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:51.741
[INAUDIBLE]

01:08:51.743 --> 01:08:57.469
[INAUDIBLE]

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:00.542
We have to get out of here.

01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:06.270
Hazel.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:23.741
Let go.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:24.895
You're the boss.

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:31.100
What have you done?

01:09:31.103 --> 01:09:34.524
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

01:09:34.526 --> 01:09:38.752
No.

01:09:43.518 --> 01:09:46.845
Hazel.

01:09:50.493 --> 01:09:51.451
Don't worry, Glitzen.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.700
We've got this.

01:09:52.702 --> 01:09:54.588
Sit down, mini man.

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:55.936
Somebody help me.

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:05.756
No, no, no.

01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:12.640
Oh, this is very frightening.

01:10:17.726 --> 01:10:20.288
Have to save at least one.

01:10:23.455 --> 01:10:26.909
Oh, sugar cookie.

01:10:26.911 --> 01:10:28.348
No.

01:10:31.839 --> 01:10:32.960
Come on, Sasha.

01:10:38.462 --> 01:10:40.348
Help me.

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:43.195
Do I look like I can
be of assistance to you

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:46.207
at this moment?

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:48.768
Hazel.

01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:56.925
We got to go.

01:10:56.927 --> 01:10:57.595
What are you doing?

01:10:57.597 --> 01:10:59.003
Let me go.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:00.989
I have to save her.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:02.620
It's too late.

01:11:07.102 --> 01:11:12.443
We have to get everyone
out of there, now.

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:30.749
It's got an emergency
shutdown, just like home.

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:35.035
Mini man, are you crazy?

01:11:51.902 --> 01:11:52.383
Glitzen?

01:11:58.879 --> 01:11:59.932
Elliot.

01:11:59.934 --> 01:12:02.268
You saved us.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.157
Not all of us.

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:06.204
Oh, mini man.

01:12:08.894 --> 01:12:09.472
What is that?

01:12:12.863 --> 01:12:13.727
Is that?

01:12:16.639 --> 01:12:18.235
Hazel?

01:12:19.071 --> 01:12:22.301
She's heading straight
for the fissure.

01:12:22.303 --> 01:12:24.859
Hold on, Hazel.

01:12:36.638 --> 01:12:39.484
Elliot, that was amazing.

01:12:39.486 --> 01:12:41.628
I had no idea you could do that.

01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:43.485
Seriously, that
was incredible.

01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:47.484
You ate that snowbank
like it was breakfast.

01:12:47.486 --> 01:12:49.853
Just a little trick I
learned from my best friend.

01:12:49.855 --> 01:12:52.221
What's on the menu
tonight, Mount Kilimanjaro?

01:12:52.223 --> 01:12:54.716
Wait a second, tonight?

01:12:54.718 --> 01:12:56.027
Oh man, tonight.

01:12:56.029 --> 01:12:56.987
We have to go.

01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:58.844
The meat lady comes tonight.

01:12:58.846 --> 01:12:59.677
Meat lady?

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:02.655
Wait, what's this
about a meat lady?

01:13:13.343 --> 01:13:15.357
Next place better have Wi-Fi.

01:13:15.359 --> 01:13:19.133
That's right,
goats, nice and easy.

01:13:21.854 --> 01:13:22.336
Hm.

01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:28.127
Put that down.

01:13:35.263 --> 01:13:38.237
I'm scared, Peanutbutter.

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:41.915
Now, now, child.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.499
Oh.

01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:48.892
I like you, little horse.

01:13:48.894 --> 01:13:51.420
I like you very much.

01:13:57.246 --> 01:13:59.387
She's ignoring my calls.

01:13:59.389 --> 01:14:00.831
I was an idiot to
ever trust that woman.

01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:05.888
You can't give up
on us now, Coach.

01:14:19.358 --> 01:14:21.693
If it's important,
you'll find a way.

01:14:21.695 --> 01:14:23.261
What did you just say, Walter?

01:14:23.263 --> 01:14:25.532
If it's important,
you'll find a way.

01:14:25.534 --> 01:14:28.091
If not, you'll find an excuse.

01:14:28.093 --> 01:14:29.597
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:31.579
but I'm done with excuses.

01:14:31.581 --> 01:14:33.468
If that meat lady thinks
she can hurt my animals,

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.004
she's got another thing coming.

01:14:35.006 --> 01:14:36.093
Come on, guys.

01:14:36.095 --> 01:14:38.012
Let's go save our petting zoo.

01:14:38.014 --> 01:14:39.868
Yeah, Coach, yeah.

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:42.716
Let's kick some
meat lady butt.

01:14:42.718 --> 01:14:46.269
Hey, um, would you
mind if I tagged along?

01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:49.019
Sounds like there might be
one heck of a story here.

01:14:49.021 --> 01:14:49.855
Hop on in.

01:14:56.766 --> 01:14:59.037
Dang it, not now.

01:14:59.039 --> 01:15:00.511
Wait, I know what to do.

01:15:03.453 --> 01:15:04.893
You wouldn't mind giving
DJ and me some cookies,

01:15:04.895 --> 01:15:06.525
would you, Santa?

01:15:06.527 --> 01:15:08.571
The two of us are a lot more
reliable than any sleigh.

01:15:08.573 --> 01:15:12.155
Well, of course, Elliot, but
I'd rather hoped you'd stay.

01:15:12.157 --> 01:15:12.925
Huh?

01:15:12.927 --> 01:15:15.228
We have a
competition to finish.

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:17.660
You still want me to compete?

01:15:17.662 --> 01:15:21.532
I may have been a little hasty
in my decision before that...

01:15:21.534 --> 01:15:24.349
all right, I was
definitely hasty.

01:15:24.351 --> 01:15:26.268
I understand why you
did what you did.

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:27.581
Me too, Santa?

01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:29.820
No, DJ, not you.

01:15:29.822 --> 01:15:32.093
But you're welcome
to try out next time.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:35.005
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

01:15:35.007 --> 01:15:36.927
So Elliot, what do you say?

01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:40.861
Don't worry, mini man.

01:15:40.863 --> 01:15:42.684
I'll take care of
everything back home.

01:15:42.686 --> 01:15:43.772
You stay and compete.

01:15:43.774 --> 01:15:45.212
You earned it.

01:15:45.214 --> 01:15:46.844
This is your chance, Elliot.

01:15:46.846 --> 01:15:48.318
This is it.

01:15:52.222 --> 01:15:56.636
Thanks, Santa, but my friends
are more important to me.

01:15:56.638 --> 01:15:58.846
Besides, Sasha would
have beaten me, anyways.

01:16:20.095 --> 01:16:21.055
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:32.575 --> 01:16:36.828
Turning my animals into lunch
meat wasn't part of the deal.

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:37.947
This is fraud.

01:16:37.949 --> 01:16:39.516
I'm calling the sheriff.

01:16:39.518 --> 01:16:41.118
I've got a contact at
the state troopers office.

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:48.859
I never should have left.

01:16:48.861 --> 01:16:50.782
I should have stayed
to help my friends.

01:16:54.046 --> 01:16:55.771
What was that?

01:16:56.957 --> 01:16:57.791
Blueberry.

01:17:04.542 --> 01:17:06.396
Make it stop.

01:17:06.398 --> 01:17:09.916
Creepy goat eyes
drill hole in my soul.

01:17:09.918 --> 01:17:12.091
Make it stop.

01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:13.532
What is even happening?

01:17:13.534 --> 01:17:15.228
They've gone full goat.

01:17:17.791 --> 01:17:21.500
No one can withstand
the full goat.

01:17:21.502 --> 01:17:22.044
Wait.

01:17:22.046 --> 01:17:22.619
Where's...

01:17:22.621 --> 01:17:23.709
Laddy.

01:17:23.711 --> 01:17:26.715
Peanutbutter?

01:17:26.717 --> 01:17:28.253
What are you doing here, boy?

01:17:28.255 --> 01:17:31.164
I thought for sure you'd be
working for Santa by now.

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:32.603
And I thought you'd
be a horse burger.

01:17:32.605 --> 01:17:34.332
Hold your tongue.

01:17:34.334 --> 01:17:37.211
A miniature horse
is nobody's burger.

01:17:37.213 --> 01:17:38.780
But I'm glad you're black.

01:17:38.782 --> 01:17:40.317
The place hasn't been
the same without you

01:17:40.319 --> 01:17:41.212
and your cloven-hoof ninny.

01:17:41.214 --> 01:17:43.131
Ew.

01:17:43.133 --> 01:17:47.644
Tell me all about your
North Pole adventure.

01:17:47.646 --> 01:17:49.565
No more of the goat.

01:17:49.567 --> 01:17:52.860
I go anywhere you like,
just no more goat.

01:17:52.862 --> 01:17:55.196
Can you believe she's
wanted in three states?

01:17:55.198 --> 01:17:57.405
Who knows how many
animals you saved tonight.

01:17:57.407 --> 01:17:59.003
Ho, ho, ho.

01:18:06.303 --> 01:18:07.996
You did it, Sasha.

01:18:07.998 --> 01:18:10.459
You won.

01:18:10.461 --> 01:18:12.988
We didn't expect to
see you tonight, Santa.

01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:17.661
Yes, well it seems we still
have an opening on the team.

01:18:17.663 --> 01:18:18.271
I don't get what you mean.

01:18:21.182 --> 01:18:24.189
Dad, what's going on?

01:18:24.191 --> 01:18:27.068
It appears you weren't the
only one Lemon Drop had been

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:30.107
supplying extra cookies to, DJ.

01:18:30.109 --> 01:18:31.643
What?

01:18:31.645 --> 01:18:36.572
The thing is, Junior,
a fear of flying actually

01:18:36.574 --> 01:18:38.011
runs in the family.

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:42.107
Donner admitted
everything after you left.

01:18:42.109 --> 01:18:44.316
I'm sorry, son,
for everything.

01:18:44.318 --> 01:18:46.335
I hope you can forgive me.

01:18:53.053 --> 01:18:55.036
You want to
check out my stall?

01:18:55.038 --> 01:18:56.991
It's got a pretty good view.

01:19:01.598 --> 01:19:03.741
So Elliot...

01:19:03.743 --> 01:19:05.500
Oh, laddie, this is it.

01:19:05.502 --> 01:19:08.060
Oh my gosh, it's
really happening.

01:19:08.062 --> 01:19:09.501
Oh, I'm getting all teary-eyed.

01:19:09.503 --> 01:19:10.587
Zip it, both of you.

01:19:10.589 --> 01:19:12.155
You're ruining his big moment.

01:19:12.157 --> 01:19:14.972
Ssh, guys.

01:19:14.974 --> 01:19:17.244
You were saying, Santa?

01:19:17.246 --> 01:19:19.163
My team and I were
hoping you were still

01:19:19.165 --> 01:19:20.764
interested in the position.

01:19:20.766 --> 01:19:22.140
Really?

01:19:22.142 --> 01:19:23.805
Really.

01:19:23.807 --> 01:19:28.253
I don't know, I've got a
lot of responsibilities here.

01:19:28.255 --> 01:19:29.691
These goats won't
hurt themselves.

01:19:29.693 --> 01:19:32.158
Laddie, are you having a go?

01:19:42.717 --> 01:19:43.774
Merry Christmas to all.

01:19:48.733 --> 01:19:51.548
And to all a good night.

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:52.764
Bye, Elliot.

01:19:52.766 --> 01:19:54.652
Have a great flight.

01:19:54.654 --> 01:19:57.468
Good bye, laddie.

01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:59.547
Now that's a story.

01:19:59.549 --> 01:20:02.748
Everybody loves an
underdog, or horse, I guess,

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:03.133
in this case.

01:20:03.135 --> 01:20:04.380
I mean it.

01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:06.683
People are going to
really respond to this.

01:20:06.685 --> 01:20:08.924
You might want to think
about sprucing this place up.

01:20:08.926 --> 01:20:09.949
Oh yeah?

01:20:09.951 --> 01:20:12.444
I have a feeling that
after this story gets out,

01:20:12.446 --> 01:20:17.788
your Witty Bitty is going
to get pretty popular.

01:20:22.001 --> 01:20:27.001
Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:20:56.029 --> 01:20:58.622
First
you learn to crawl.

01:21:02.686 --> 01:21:10.172
Who do I turn to if
I just hit the wall?

01:21:10.174 --> 01:21:16.732
Walking through fire over
a wire, mired in doubt.

01:21:16.734 --> 01:21:19.196
Feels like I'm
running in quicksand,

01:21:19.198 --> 01:21:22.011
sinking in the crowd.

01:21:22.013 --> 01:21:25.820
I'm light on my feet.

01:21:25.822 --> 01:21:30.268
Always stand at the moment.

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:35.580
[INAUDIBLE] see something
deep inside this moment.

01:21:35.582 --> 01:21:39.068
Life's at full speed.

01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:43.067
It can put me through to pieces.

01:21:43.069 --> 01:21:49.695
Small as I seem, because I'm
off, yeah I'm off to the races.

01:21:56.670 --> 01:22:03.035
Some say it's always
darkest before the dawn.

01:22:03.037 --> 01:22:10.459
The shadows will show you
where the light comes from.

01:22:10.461 --> 01:22:13.724
The rise and the falls,
disguises and all,

01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:17.308
let them fall to the ground.

01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:20.284
Coursing through veins,
breaking shackles and chains.

01:22:20.286 --> 01:22:23.836
Take the reigns and run.

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:28.124
I'm light on my feet.

01:22:28.126 --> 01:22:31.643
Always stand at the moment.

01:22:31.645 --> 01:22:38.331
[INAUDIBLE] to see something
deep inside this moment.

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:44.988
Life's at full speed, can
put me through the pieces.

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:52.412
Small as I seem because I'm
off, yeah I'm off to the races.

01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:59.580
Oh, yeah I'm off,
I'm off to the races.

01:22:59.582 --> 01:23:05.788
Oh, yeah I'm off,
I'm off to the races.

01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:12.411
I did all the right things and
followed each chartered course,

01:23:12.413 --> 01:23:15.742
using the stars
to guide the way.

01:23:19.006 --> 01:23:22.172
I've got to be faster,
stronger, better

01:23:22.174 --> 01:23:25.915
for longer, bigger, and taller.

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:28.222
But you're only as
small as you feel.

01:23:31.389 --> 01:23:35.419
Stay light on your feet.

01:23:35.421 --> 01:23:38.875
Always stand at the moment.

01:23:38.877 --> 01:23:45.019
[INAUDIBLE] Something
deep inside this moment.

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:48.924
Life's at full speed.

01:23:48.926 --> 01:23:52.284
It can put me
through the pieces.

01:23:52.286 --> 01:24:00.252
Small as I seem because I'm
off, yeah I'm off to the races.

01:24:00.254 --> 01:24:01.307
Oh.

01:24:01.309 --> 01:24:03.420
Yeah, I'm off.

01:24:03.422 --> 01:24:06.780
I'm off to the races.

01:24:06.782 --> 01:24:10.523
I've got a deep desire
like a burning fire.

01:24:10.525 --> 01:24:13.692
Come on and take my hand.

01:24:13.694 --> 01:24:15.803
We'll be kings and [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:15.805 --> 01:24:18.299
We'll reach so much higher.

01:24:18.301 --> 01:24:22.011
You and me, my friend.

01:24:22.013 --> 01:24:23.547
So many things to see.

01:24:23.549 --> 01:24:25.756
Hold tight and follow me.

01:24:25.758 --> 01:24:26.910
I've done it all before.

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:31.515
Look up to [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:31.517 --> 01:24:33.531
Tonight is [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:33.533 --> 01:24:37.564
I'll show you so much more.

01:24:37.566 --> 01:24:41.307
I've been around the
world, I've seen it all.

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:45.340
Come on and follow me.

01:24:45.342 --> 01:24:49.083
I want to show you how
we can have it all.

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:50.239
Come on and follow me.

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:51.166
I want to show you how
we can have it all.
