01:01.760 --> 01:04.239
I mistreated her, despise her.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.320
She deserved a better wife.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.280
And now it is not.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.080
I'll miss her.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.520
You will never be alone.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.160
You have to accept that the Lord took it away from us was not in vain.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.320
He tells you to go on your way.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.840
I do not know what to do,

01:50.240 --> 01:51.800
so I dragged the body here.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.120
You did right.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.600
- What will you do with him?  - I feed it to the pigs.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.200
- What for?  - They will not leave traces.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.880
What did he say exactly?

02:07.080 --> 02:08.280
He said...

02:09.280 --> 02:11.280
that the king was elected not by the Lord.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.360
He questioned the legality of your brother's claims

02:14.600 --> 02:15.840
a throne?

02:17.440 --> 02:19.240
What to do with this is Vatican?

02:20.960 --> 02:25.160
Church enthusiastically enjoys the secrets to increase their influence and power.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.160
It is necessary to examine the records.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.200
Not only those related to the Bourbons, but also all the royal blood.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.560
Every family has its secrets.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.680
End of the game at hand.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.880
The moment has come when I have to make a move, even if it hurt me.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.480
My claim to Spain

04:02.720 --> 04:03.880
is no longer in force.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.360
Cardinal Summer arrives on behalf of the Pope's funeral.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.280
But, sir, now that the queen left us,

04:11.760 --> 04:13.800
Leopold ukrepylos Pos.

04:13.960 --> 04:14.960
Really.

04:15.200 --> 04:19.640
I want to Cardinal approved the alliance between Charles and my niece, Mary Louise.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.160
He did not leave from us, while Spain will not mine.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.440
Sir, to convince the cardinal will be no easy task.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.080
We know that the Vatican scare the aspirations of his Majesty.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.880
That is why I must convince him that I'm an ally of him,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.280
rather than a threat.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.440
It only remains to understand how.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.920
Protestants.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.720
The Catholic Church fears the spread of Protestant influence in Europe.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.000
Showing the cardinal that Protestants have no place in Versailles,

04:51.240 --> 04:54.760
His Majesty show himself a defender of the Catholic faith.

04:54.920 --> 04:55.920
How?

04:56.240 --> 04:59.640
Protestants should be publicly punished.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.040
Punishment?

05:01.480 --> 05:02.400
Without a crime?

05:03.120 --> 05:05.400
This is their cross, his and bear.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.720
The Protestant community sees this another provocation.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.440
And what will they do? Raise arms?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.360
No. Leave the country.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.640
The economic consequences would be devastating.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.120
Trade,

05:20.360 --> 05:23.800
Law and medicine are mainly in the hands of Protestant families.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.160
So let them go.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.160
But how to remedy the lack in the budget?

05:28.320 --> 05:30.360
People will pay. we will raise

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
tax on salt.

05:31.760 --> 05:36.240
Sir, we raised the tax on salt every year in the last ten years.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.480
At least, no one accuse us of inconsistency.

05:44.960 --> 05:45.920
Colbert.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.960
Ottoman merchant still here?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.040
Yes, sir.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.440
Tell them to bring it to me.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.240
I regret.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.000
Please forgive me.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.520
It must be hard for you. I know you were close.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.800
She was always so kind to me.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.040
And it's mutual, I have no doubt.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.080
You thought she had died not of natural causes.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.720
Until now, I guess.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.520
You must be searched.

06:34.760 --> 06:35.720
maid

06:35.960 --> 06:37.000
almost no emissions.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.520
Thank you.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.440
An unusual case.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.000
Where did you get?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.520
This is a gift.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.480
By whom?

06:51.400 --> 06:52.120
I forgot.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.000
I knew a lot of killers.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.840
One thing always gives their guilt.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.400
Their eyes.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.360
Good day.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.280
Your Highness.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.920
I would like to bring their condolences.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.760
I know you were close to the Queen.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.640
One of the divine mysteries:

07:29.800 --> 07:33.520
why some beautiful souls go in the color.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.440
One mountain, the other - the joy.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.080
I apologize?

07:39.480 --> 07:40.960
The queen left us.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.880
King is now entirely yours.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.840
King does not belong to anyone.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.120
Until then, until the thoughts remarry.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.760
You do not think that the king did not re-marry.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.080
Maybe now his heart and yours, but soon

07:58.320 --> 08:01.120
you'll be just another name in the list of his amorous conquests.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.440
Your Majesty.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.960
The document on the table, I would like you to sign it.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.240
This agreement assures me

08:23.480 --> 08:26.720
the exclusive right to the trade route to the Mediterranean.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.280
But in exchange?

08:32.520 --> 08:35.080
If your emperor decides to invade Austria,

08:35.559 --> 08:37.600
I would not stand in his way.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.920
- Can I trust His Majesty? - King - man of his word.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.040
I immediately go on a journey to deliver the good news.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.800
The sea?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.400
The ship is waiting for me at Toulon, from there I sail to Malta.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.200
Your Eminence, I hope the trip was not too painful.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.680
Not so painful as this ladder.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.680
I'll take you to the room.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.880
No, I need to first see His Majesty.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.080
As you wish.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.000
What is your name?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.640
Alexander Bontan, Eminence.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.600
I am a manager at Versailles.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.520
So you - Bontan?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.080
Do you know who I am?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.720
Of course.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.840
Where Mgr di Marco?

09:56.800 --> 09:58.520
I thought he would meet me.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.600
I can not know, sir.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.840
Find him.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.480
Tell him to come to my chambers.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.480
On behalf of His Holiness Pope Innocent XI

10:17.080 --> 10:19.880
I bring to you my most sincere condolences.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.520
she died

10:23.200 --> 10:24.520
too early.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.240
Thank you.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.960
Are the rooms of his Eminence?

10:31.120 --> 10:32.400
Of course, sir.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.040
Ly came to lead us from Emperor Leopold?

10:43.000 --> 10:43.720
News?

10:44.120 --> 10:47.400
I received a message stating that he would come to the funeral.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.360
Well, happy to accept it.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.480
We risk.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.280
And this is only the beginning of the Duchess.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.760
Concern in our environment grows.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.880
We have to stay strong, do not forget who we are.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.400
Can I steal a moment the Duchess?

11:23.640 --> 11:25.720
In our last conversation

11:27.200 --> 11:28.680
you told me,

11:29.640 --> 11:33.880
I would not marry me, I'll be the last man on earth. I would like to say about their desires.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.000
Your desires were very clear.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.520
I ask, forget about my past.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.520
And about my reputation.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.000
Actually,

11:43.360 --> 11:45.520
I'm trying to say is ...

11:46.920 --> 11:48.280
I think I love you.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.040
I know that I love you.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.920
And I promised to help your nephew.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.720
But, to my shame, I have not succeeded.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.280
Lord courtiers!

11:58.960 --> 12:01.600
I appeal to the Protestants among you.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.440
According to the order of the king,

12:04.680 --> 12:09.120
I demand that anyone who owns a Bible in French,

12:09.240 --> 12:10.360
We gave it.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.480
Discard

12:12.720 --> 12:14.040
these sinful things,

12:14.280 --> 12:16.040
otherwise you will be exposed to a search.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.640
And your quarters turned upside down.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.480
Dolphin.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.400
Do not give up.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.480
First, you arrest M. de Puy,

12:32.720 --> 12:35.760
then forcing us to abandon our faith, and now - is it?

12:35.920 --> 12:37.520
- It's outrageous. - No, ma'am.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.280
word of God

12:39.520 --> 12:43.000
should sound in Latin, and only from the lips of ministers

12:43.240 --> 12:44.320
church.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.960
Allowing people to read it yourself,

12:47.120 --> 12:51.160
we push them on the path of error and heresy.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.480
I wish to speak with the king.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.600
Unless he wants

12:54.840 --> 12:55.880
speak with you.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.360
Why?

13:00.720 --> 13:02.520
Because that's needed.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.120
Believe me,

13:04.360 --> 13:06.000
I'm sorry for your pain.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.320
No, Francoise, you do not feel anything.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.200
I think the Duchess lost her mind.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.880
But she managed to keep

13:16.120 --> 13:16.960
bravery.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.280
Your admiration is inappropriate.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.560
I think it's outrageous.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.640
I myself was a Protestant.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.480
And I do not like the fact that these people are not considered loyal subjects.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.600
My brother does not tolerate those who disagree with him.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.720
Who honored us?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.520
Do not you recognize her?

13:54.480 --> 13:55.560
This is your daughter.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.240
Maria Luisa.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.480
And the next Queen of Spain.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.760
Maria Luisa I - Princess Palatine.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.040
Your stepmother.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.600
- I thought you were ... - Witch?

14:08.920 --> 14:10.800
I thought we agreed that she will marry your son.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.000
Look at it as a happy opportunity.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.560
- For you. - For both of us.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.760
Tonight, during a holiday, it will present to His Holiness Cardinal Summer.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.400
If it will make an impression on him,

14:21.560 --> 14:24.760
I look forward to the blessing of the union with the Pope.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.720
Let you prepare it.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.520
From now on, you belong to France.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.240
I have a task for you.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.680
How to convince

14:45.840 --> 14:49.240
arrogant and smug papal envoy

14:49.400 --> 14:51.000
to do what we want from him?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.760
Why are you asking me such a question?

14:55.080 --> 14:56.080
Well,

14:56.480 --> 14:59.280
because you are familiar with the sentiments of the people close to the authorities.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.320
You keep us in their little fingers.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.080
You play with us.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.800
We obey his will.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.680
His Majesty...

15:16.080 --> 15:18.680
will not let me concentrate.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.880
Of course.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.440
But to return to our business.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.040
This is the Pope's envoy, then ...

15:35.560 --> 15:36.800
his power ...

15:38.080 --> 15:39.760
stronger faith.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.160
Maybe.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.000
He achieved his position

15:48.520 --> 15:50.760
betrayal and bribery.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.200
Undoubtedly.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.480
He cares only

16:02.680 --> 16:04.800
about power and their status.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.160
hence,

16:17.240 --> 16:19.120
he needs flattery.

16:24.240 --> 16:24.960
Yes?

16:31.040 --> 16:33.400
Let me introduce you to Madame de Maintenon.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.800
Your Holiness.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.400
I hope you are satisfied with their housing.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.320
say,

16:51.400 --> 16:52.480
Do you believe

16:52.960 --> 16:54.520
that tyranny can be something good?

16:55.600 --> 16:58.840
You need for yourself Strasbourg and Luxembourg.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.200
Do you want to rule the world and bring Leopold oblivion.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.040
Believe me, Your Eminence, I do not need power, I need peace.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.079
Call it a tyranny, if you want.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.880
You need Spain and its position.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.160
Yes, to protect her.

17:15.839 --> 17:19.599
What to Leopold, nobody respects it more than I do.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.480
But I believe that the church deserves

17:22.720 --> 17:24.240
a strong defender.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.920
After the death of the Queen

17:26.560 --> 17:28.920
you can no longer claim to be Spain.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.440
It is a matter not claims and debt.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.640
It is my duty - to protect the interests of the church.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.400
And I hope that His Holiness will understand correctly

17:39.640 --> 17:40.760
my aspirations.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.800
It is solely a desire to serve.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.640
His Holiness has blessed

17:48.800 --> 17:50.880
Union of Spanish King Charles

17:51.120 --> 17:53.040
and Eleanor Princess.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.960
And if I will present a suitable candidate?

17:57.480 --> 17:58.520
For example?

17:59.400 --> 18:01.720
My niece, Princess Maria Luisa.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.480
M. Marchal,

18:12.840 --> 18:14.120
Can I talk to you?

18:14.360 --> 18:15.480
Of course.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.280
It's about His Highness the Duke of Orleans.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.560
King is concerned about the state of his mind.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.680
Sorry to hear that,

18:22.920 --> 18:24.720
but I do not know what to do with it I have.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.680
I've seen recently, you spoke to him.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.000
I thought maybe he had said or done something,

18:31.560 --> 18:33.720
to show you ...

18:34.960 --> 18:36.000
unusual.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.360
For example?

18:37.680 --> 18:38.400
his Highness

18:38.640 --> 18:41.280
I was convinced that he had conspired against.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.640
I tried to help him solve the puzzle.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.480
Our search was to no avail, and I thought he gave up the idea.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.360
But I'm afraid I was wrong.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.000
He did not speak to me about it.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.240
But if that happens, I'll let you know the king.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.040
First, warn me.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.400
His Majesty's already a lot of worries right now.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.160
As you wish.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.720
Tell me about the king's brother.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.640
He continues to poke his nose into our affairs?

19:35.720 --> 19:37.720
As a dog, smell fox.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.200
With each passing day it is getting closer to the truth.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.640
King informed him of the investigation?

19:51.480 --> 19:53.080
Where is the prisoner?

19:53.600 --> 19:54.840
In a safe place.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.600
Let there remain until you need me.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.200
Your Eminence ...

20:04.320 --> 20:07.400
if the identity of the prisoner will be open ...

20:08.600 --> 20:10.720
the consequences will be extremely serious.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.920
Do you think I do not know?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.440
I would never have come here not,

20:16.680 --> 20:20.200
If your requirements are not the king have gone too far.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.680
What do you think,

20:33.920 --> 20:35.840
Women are the duties?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.920
To serve her husband.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.200
Be true.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.400
Show modesty.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.480
And to bring up children.

20:45.640 --> 20:50.120
Imagine that your husband says that the world is full of fairies.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.400
What do you say?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.440
I will support his opinion.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.440
AND...

20:57.440 --> 21:00.320
And if he asks you to enter naked in the fountain?

21:01.840 --> 21:05.600
I will try to fulfill his request.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.520
You learn a lot.

21:12.280 --> 21:16.040
Women - only pawns in men's games.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.880
They own us.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.200
But do not let them break your spirit.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.680
- I came to examine her highness. - It's impossible.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.400
- Who is the wrong moment. - That is the order of the king, your highness.

21:43.160 --> 21:43.880
Maria Luisa ...

21:45.840 --> 21:47.280
You must examine the doctor.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.480
Please lie down and raise your dress.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.160
Do not touch me.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.880
Send for His Highness.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.360
He should make sure that you are innocent.

22:04.840 --> 22:05.920
My dear...

22:06.360 --> 22:07.240
I will not let.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.600
The doctor is only doing his duty.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.960
You should do the same. It only takes a few minutes.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.000
Maria Luisa!

22:14.720 --> 22:15.520
What's going on here?

22:15.760 --> 22:17.680
The doctor came to examine her.

22:18.040 --> 22:18.920
My dear,

22:19.440 --> 22:21.000
you have to understand,

22:21.520 --> 22:24.240
without that your marriage is impossible.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.000
Please do not let him.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.080
Now lie down on the bed.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.200
King!

23:02.800 --> 23:03.520
say,

23:04.080 --> 23:07.800
what are the plans of His Majesty about the future of marriage?

23:08.280 --> 23:11.160
I'm still in mourning and did not consider this question.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.800
But you satisfy your needs with one of his mistresses.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.240
Glory to your yard

23:16.400 --> 23:19.560
It does not go to any comparison with your sexual appetites.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.280
But where is the princess?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.400
I can not wait to meet her.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.880
It will be soon.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.720
And here it is.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.720
I present to you my brother, the Duke of Orleans,

23:42.880 --> 23:45.720
his wife, Princess Palatine, and his daughter,

23:46.320 --> 23:47.640
Mary Louise.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.200
A great honor for me.

23:58.920 --> 23:59.960
Walk.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.400
Approach.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.160
Tell me something about yourself.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.200
What are your interests?

24:20.840 --> 24:24.240
I have very little to say about yourself, your Eminence.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.840
I am young and inexperienced is

24:27.080 --> 24:29.400
with regard to secular traditions. I prefer to listen to.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.360
Do you pray?

24:31.520 --> 24:33.360
I go to Mass twice a day.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.680
And the embroidery?

24:35.240 --> 24:36.680
Very fond of.

24:37.120 --> 24:37.840
say,

24:38.080 --> 24:40.880
what do you think,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.080
It must be a woman

24:43.400 --> 24:44.600
married?

24:44.760 --> 24:46.920
I think a woman should be submissive and loyal,

24:47.080 --> 24:48.240
under any circumstances.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.840
What a charming young creature.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.680
We turn to food?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.160
Ladies and Gentlemen,

25:43.560 --> 25:44.800
Your Eminence,

25:45.240 --> 25:48.320
I ask all of you to get up and go to the window.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.600
What they burn?

26:13.160 --> 26:14.200
Protestant Bible.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.120
No!

26:22.040 --> 26:25.120
It seems, at the court of many Protestants.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.320
Many have already renounced their faith.

26:28.280 --> 26:29.720
How did you do it?

26:31.040 --> 26:32.600
Gentle exhortations.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.400
Let's say His Holiness approve

26:45.720 --> 26:48.280
union your niece and King Charles.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.760
Do you realize that this will happen under certain conditions?

26:54.600 --> 26:55.720
Of course.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.080
Strasbourg and Luxembourg

26:58.320 --> 27:00.080
remain under the rule of Leopold.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.640
And you

27:03.360 --> 27:06.560
guarantee the protection of the Holy Roman Empire

27:07.080 --> 27:10.680
in the face of an imminent invasion of the Ottomans.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.320
You have my word.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.120
Good.

27:21.680 --> 27:25.320
Should I conclude that his Eminence approves this marriage?

27:27.200 --> 27:29.760
I have not yet made a decision.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.240
Of course.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.080
Thank you, my child.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.920
What are you doing?

28:03.440 --> 28:04.600
I thought...

28:05.720 --> 28:07.520
You thought wrong.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.760
desires of the flesh

28:15.520 --> 28:17.320
I'm not interested.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.440
But Strawberry ...

28:45.160 --> 28:46.320
19...

28:47.200 --> 28:48.320
22...

28:49.200 --> 28:50.440
26...

28:50.600 --> 28:51.680
31...

29:01.600 --> 29:02.960
1619.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.400
1622.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.640
26.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
31.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.480
Four stillborn children.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.640
AND?

29:10.800 --> 29:14.000
Seven years passed before the birth of your brother.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.720
What happened before that?

29:15.880 --> 29:19.240
Nothing. They tried, they did not, and then my brother was born.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.560
Maybe.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.040
What else can be the explanation?

29:23.200 --> 29:23.960
What if your father

29:24.200 --> 29:27.080
He despaired of the fact that he will never have a son?

29:27.240 --> 29:30.320
Which his wife was unable to give him.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.400
The nightmare of any king.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.600
He remained a simple choice.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.640
- give birth to a son with another woman? - Exactly.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.120
The heir, who may still be alive.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.160
And he wears an iron mask that hides his face.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.200
So, my father had a mistress.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.680
I did not know that my father had relations with other women.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.680
I know someone who might know about them.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.960
I have not seen him in the salons of the past ten years.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.640
Court life not to his liking.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.720
And if he is still alive?

30:14.240 --> 30:15.400
Monsieur?

30:16.920 --> 30:18.000
Monsieur?

30:20.960 --> 30:21.800
What?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.520
Is the fire?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.680
Oh, good evening, Your Highness.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.920
Please forgive me that we disturb you at this hour.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.040
I am sure you have a good reason.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.800
I want to ask you a question.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.600
You knew my father, did not you?

30:37.760 --> 30:40.400
Yes, I had the honor to be his friend.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.000
He had a mistress?

30:44.200 --> 30:46.000
Your father was a faithful husband.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.120
He had a mistress?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I do not know about that.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.560
You're lying.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.040
You were a friend of the Count of Soissons.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.440
Right?

31:06.240 --> 31:07.920
I barely knew him.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
Only?

31:10.920 --> 31:12.160
And yet

31:12.320 --> 31:15.600
You have teamed up with them to overthrow your "friend" of the king.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.760
It would be unfortunate,

31:17.920 --> 31:21.600
if the present king learned of your treachery to his father.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.240
Tell me about his mistress.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.560
You may not like it here,

31:35.800 --> 31:38.480
but the cold prison cell like you even less.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.480
There were rumors ...

31:45.800 --> 31:47.040
Her name?

31:49.160 --> 31:51.080
Luiz de Lafayette.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.680
She was one of the maids of honor of the queen.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.480
What happened to her?

31:57.640 --> 32:00.320
After the connection with your father

32:01.200 --> 32:05.040
she left the yard and went to the convent of Chaillot.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.040
I believe,

32:08.520 --> 32:12.840
Your father visited her until his death.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.800
This Lafayette could have a baby,

32:21.120 --> 32:23.080
whom my father admitted,

32:23.560 --> 32:25.480
if my mother had not given birth to an heir.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.360
Exactly.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.160
And when your brother was born,

32:30.320 --> 32:32.440
Lafayette decided to leave the yard.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.160
Are you angry with me.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.320
No. To myself.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.040
Why?

33:16.480 --> 33:20.160
I know you can not abandon its responsibilities, but ...

33:21.960 --> 33:25.520
I know it's naive on my part, but it's stronger than me.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.160
I understand.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.160
True?

33:41.240 --> 33:44.240
Since then, when I first saw you, I wanted to be with you.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.800
And here we are together, but you have me taken away.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.800
You told me that I'll never be lonely.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.000
And now...

34:01.200 --> 34:03.160
I say the same to you.

34:40.639 --> 34:41.760
Get up!

34:43.239 --> 34:45.400
- What's the matter? - Get ready.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.000
- For what? - By meeting with the cardinal.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.880
I want you to hit him with his mind

34:52.040 --> 34:54.159
and modesty, for what you just can do.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.320
But why?

34:55.920 --> 34:59.080
Because with it you will become the next queen of Spain.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.240
I must thank you.

35:13.360 --> 35:17.560
Your presence here proves that you are a brave and ingenious performing their duty.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.640
Thank you, Your Highness.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.520
But...

35:23.240 --> 35:24.600
I must warn you.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.640
Me hanging suspicions.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.320
Head of the royal guard convinced

35:30.480 --> 35:32.560
that the Queen had died not of natural causes.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.760
- He's got proof? - No.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.360
But I am afraid of him.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.280
Honey, if there is no evidence, then there is nothing to fear.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.040
You'll be near my niece until our departure.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.000
As you wish.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.920
Tell me about Louis. What's on his mind?

35:53.520 --> 35:55.800
King handles cases behind closed doors.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.840
In the salons say little about politics.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.520
But there is always something to eat.

36:05.440 --> 36:06.800
Someone has visited?

36:10.640 --> 36:13.600
Yesterday he was visited by some merchant

36:13.840 --> 36:15.400
he spoke with Monsieur Colbert.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.240
Dealer? What a trader? Where?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.000
I do not know.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.040
He was like a native of the Middle East.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.200
He said that in Toulon is going to catch a boat to Malta.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.720
- Find this merchant. - Yes, Your Majesty.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.680
Please accept my condolences.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.800
Her death - a tragedy, she was an amazing woman.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.080
Thank you.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.480
Should be, you feel lost without it.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.760
- At heart she is still with me. - Just as in every soul.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.400
Do you really think that I will never know the truth?

37:31.800 --> 37:32.960
The truth?

37:33.400 --> 37:37.000
You convinced her to go to Spain to arrange the marriage of Charles and your niece.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.400
You used it.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.360
I am not alone.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.120
Why did you come here?

37:45.080 --> 37:46.200
Mourn.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.240
But this is not the only reason.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.000
You want to see the Cardinal,

37:51.440 --> 37:54.200
to enlist its support on the issue of Spain.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.280
You read me like an open book, Louis.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.800
Like I do.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.160
But I succeed.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.720
Nothing like this.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.200
Maybe he supports you, but he knows all your weaknesses.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.640
By the way, your wife was a delightful mistress.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.280
So much passion ...

38:19.360 --> 38:20.760
So much imagination ...

38:48.840 --> 38:49.760
Can I do something to help?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.760
Yes, leave us.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.280
You find anything?

38:59.720 --> 39:01.000
Maybe.

39:02.880 --> 39:06.480
It scares me the idea of ​​half-brother, whose existence I did not know.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.560
Soon we all know.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.640
Entries in the parish books

39:11.880 --> 39:14.680
all births and deaths in the past 50 years.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.160
You blindly approach the precipice.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.640
And if you do not jump on their own, Louis himself will push you.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.800
Perhaps he is sincere in his desire to protect the Holy Roman Empire.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.560
This is my job.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.400
But if you can still carry it?

39:39.520 --> 39:42.480
Louis serves only to himself, he sees himself as God.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.800
He has the power and authority,

39:45.960 --> 39:49.320
which you may lack.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.840
The Pope has already approved the union of Eleanor and King Charles.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.280
Maybe.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.360
But after the death of the queen had no rights.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.040
Do not be so sure.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.080
Nothing.

40:11.680 --> 40:12.800
Nothing.

40:20.640 --> 40:24.000
M. Marchal, His Majesty wants to talk to you.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.480
M. Marchal, I have a job for you.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.880
Of course.

40:49.960 --> 40:53.160
It's about a niece of Emperor Leopold, Princess Eleanor.

40:53.720 --> 40:56.280
It has become a hindrance to my plans.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.040
I do not like noise.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.760
With all due respect, sir ...

41:13.480 --> 41:15.960
Do princess deserves such a fate?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.440
She is young.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.120
But dangerous.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.280
Yes?

41:32.080 --> 41:33.160
Good afternoon.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.200
I see you come on duty.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.440
You are looking for evidence.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.200
But something is troubling you.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.520
What is it?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.640
I'm beginning to doubt all his beliefs.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.720
In all that I have done.

42:14.360 --> 42:17.080
I think of things that would never hear.

43:04.520 --> 43:05.640
Thank you.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.000
For what?

43:10.440 --> 43:11.680
Trust.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.880
How soon will we see you again?

43:43.800 --> 43:46.400
Or am I just a passing fancy?

43:49.520 --> 43:51.760
I will come to you tonight,

43:52.160 --> 43:53.480
if I may.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.320
Can.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.760
In the meantime,

44:00.720 --> 44:03.480
I would like you to do something for me.

44:04.920 --> 44:07.160
So what is the real reason for your visit?

44:11.280 --> 44:12.680
What should I do?

44:14.760 --> 44:16.400
You know, maybe,

44:16.560 --> 44:20.280
King became interested in Princess Eleanor.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.040
Yes, I know.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.040
You're close to the princess.

44:27.720 --> 44:30.280
His Majesty would like to see her.

44:30.760 --> 44:31.880
Alone.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.920
So that her uncle did not know anything.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.120
Where?

44:37.760 --> 44:38.880
When?

44:39.280 --> 44:41.240
Before the funeral.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.080
In a greenhouse.

44:51.240 --> 44:52.280
- Now you trust me? - Yes.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.400
- Where is your uncle? - I have no idea.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.960
- I think your life is in danger. - I'm doomed - do you mean?

45:27.520 --> 45:28.640
No! Listen.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.280
Listen to me!

45:31.200 --> 45:33.720
- I think you're going to kill. - Who?

45:33.960 --> 45:35.360
A man from the king.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.120
We have to warn your uncle and you have to leave immediately for Spain.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.400
- I do not want to go to Spain. - But you can not stay here.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.680
So what should I do?

45:45.760 --> 45:47.680
- Run. - How?

45:48.600 --> 45:49.720
I will help you.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.760
Why should I believe you?

45:53.800 --> 45:55.200
Because I'll run with you.

45:55.360 --> 45:56.520
Eleanor?

45:57.680 --> 45:58.400
When?

45:59.040 --> 46:00.280
Immediately.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.080
Are you ready?

46:03.800 --> 46:07.200
If His Majesty will forgive me, I would have wanted to stay at home.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.520
Why?

46:08.680 --> 46:10.320
I feel bad, uncle.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.600
Women's malaise.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.800
ABOUT! Clear.

46:18.800 --> 46:19.920
Well, well.

46:27.560 --> 46:28.680
Are you sure?

46:28.920 --> 46:30.200
I have nothing to lose.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.000
I was right.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.200
"Born on this day,

46:38.440 --> 46:39.440
"In the year of the Great 1637

46:39.640 --> 46:41.520
"Son, Robert ...

46:42.320 --> 46:44.920
"In the presence of Martin's father, the parish priest,

46:45.080 --> 46:47.760
"Madame and Sekretan, midwife.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.000
"Louis de Bourbon, King of France.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.080
"And Luiz de Lafayette."

47:20.840 --> 47:22.320
Something is wrong?

47:23.040 --> 47:24.160
There is nothing.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.720
We have lost a man,

48:34.400 --> 48:36.880
dear to our hearts. We mourn her.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.440
And we mourn themselves.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.080
We ourselves suffer

48:42.320 --> 48:43.640
from this loss.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.560
And we wonder about the mystery,

48:48.480 --> 48:50.120
which represents our Lord.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.880
But there is a human life,

48:54.960 --> 48:57.440
if not a short path of light,

48:58.160 --> 49:00.080
surrounded on all sides ...

49:02.240 --> 49:03.360
endless

49:03.720 --> 49:05.360
shadows?

49:07.040 --> 49:09.240
We think about this darkness.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.880
We do not know anything about her.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.360
But do not be afraid of it.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.320
We have to accept it.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.840
Because it is not dark at all,

49:26.440 --> 49:29.000
but the light that will shine forever.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.040
It is the light of faith.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.760
Glory.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.760
It is the light of God.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.360
A beautiful ceremony.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.880
Brother!

50:01.640 --> 50:02.920
Brother!

50:06.400 --> 50:08.040
Can I talk to you now.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.600
Now.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.480
Talk.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.800
Tell me what you've done.

50:31.800 --> 50:32.840
I did nothing.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.360
What happened? What did you want to talk about?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.440
O justice.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.080
About Justice?

50:44.280 --> 50:45.880
We have an older brother.
