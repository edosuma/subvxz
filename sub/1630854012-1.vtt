Here comes the new dad.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.221
He's not my new dad.

00:04.265 --> 00:06.180
I was Starman's sidekick.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.443
- It's you.
- I'm looking for Pat Dugan.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.227
Name's Sylvester Pemberton.

00:10.271 --> 00:12.055
We stopped that freak together.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.317
I'm Stargirl.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.580
And that's my sidekick.
- Great.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.800
- Hi. I'm Courtney.
- I'm Beth.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.454

00:26.765 --> 00:27.723

00:27.766 --> 00:29.203
You asked Cindy Burman

00:29.246 --> 00:30.856

00:30.900 --> 00:32.728
I wanna join the JSA.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.121
Crusher,
what are you doing here?

00:34.164 --> 00:35.600
We didn't come back to town

00:35.644 --> 00:37.820
for revenge on you
and the Scooby Gang.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.041
The house next door sold.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.608
Howdy, neighbor!

00:43.652 --> 00:44.696

01:31.526 --> 01:33.745
All right. Nice!

01:36.183 --> 01:37.619
- Hello, Maria.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.490
Morning, Zeke.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.797
- Good morning, Deb.
- Good morning, Darryl.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.928
How have you been?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.321
Want the usual?

02:22.403 --> 02:24.361
Pedal, Jakeem!
Pump those feet!

02:24.405 --> 02:27.277
That guy is spooksville.
Let's split!

02:29.627 --> 02:32.587
both: Good morning!

02:38.636 --> 02:40.377
- Breakfast!

02:40.421 --> 02:42.727
Bacon and eggs.

03:08.318 --> 03:12.714
What the hell?

03:12.757 --> 03:14.803
- Bye, Dorothy.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.816

03:43.832 --> 03:47.009
Would you like some help
with that?

03:47.052 --> 03:50.360
It looks kind of--pretty big.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.057
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.935
All right, Crock team.

Well, trip's over, Mike.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.214
Hey, no use
complaining about it now.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.435
Why do you try sitting in the
back seat of a car for 12 hours

05:48.478 --> 05:50.785
when you know we have
a flying robot at home, Pat?

05:50.828 --> 05:52.700
Welcome home,
Star family.

05:52.743 --> 05:55.398
Hey, Sylvester.
How you doing?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.139
Hey, buddy.
Oh, who's a good boy?

05:57.182 --> 05:59.228
Who's a good boy?

05:59.271 --> 06:00.403
Well, how was the trip?

06:00.447 --> 06:02.057
- Memorable.
- Horrendous.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.060
Surprisingly busy.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.279
It was great.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.194
Pat, the stache.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.153
You left home a boy
and came back a man.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.416
Are you kidding?
Look at him.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.419
He looks like an evil Pat Dugan
from a parallel universe.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.422
You know, facial hair
is a man's birthright, Mike.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.119
You'll understand
when you start shaving.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.817
I shave.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.079
Do you?

06:24.122 --> 06:25.820
Oh, my God.

06:25.863 --> 06:29.040
Sylvester,
you fixed everything?

06:31.173 --> 06:35.307
This marble looks expensive.
- Whoa.

06:35.351 --> 06:39.268
Well, a house guest
needs to earn his keep.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.444
You know, Mike and I
actually had that

06:41.488 --> 06:42.880
on a list of things to do.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.708
Yeah.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.797
both: What list?

06:55.676 --> 06:57.068
Whoa.

07:00.724 --> 07:04.032
- What do you think?
- It's amazing.

07:04.075 --> 07:07.427
- It's neat, huh?
- And no more cobwebs.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.819
That was the hardest part,
I think.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.474
Oh,
where's Cosmo's crate?

07:11.518 --> 07:15.652
In the garage,
because I made a new one.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.525
A display case.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.352
Right by your bed...

07:30.145 --> 07:33.322
I think he likes it.
Look at that.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.281
- Oh. Oh.

07:36.325 --> 07:39.023
Maybe the case is overkill.

07:39.067 --> 07:43.724
I-I just didn't know how
to thank a big, golden stick.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.248
I mean, the Staff's the reason
why I'm not dead now.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.293
I've been wanting
to talk to you about that,

07:48.337 --> 07:51.035
but I didn't wanna be rude.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.080
Oh, how I'm back?

07:52.123 --> 07:53.298
Yeah, I'm still trying

07:53.342 --> 07:55.562
to figure that out exactly.

07:55.605 --> 08:00.436
Did I mention that I woke up
in my own coffin?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.526
Yeah. I used to be
a pretty cool superhero,

08:03.570 --> 08:09.271
but it's hard to keep your cool
when you're buried alive.

08:09.314 --> 08:13.057
So I did a lot of screaming.

08:13.101 --> 08:16.191
And when I dug myself out,

08:16.234 --> 08:20.543
I somehow was completely fine.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.676
I don't understand it,

08:22.719 --> 08:27.811
but I think when you formed
the bond with Cosmo over there,

08:27.855 --> 08:31.336
it woke up the bond
I have with him too.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.907
If-if you're reconsidering
what you said

08:36.951 --> 08:40.171
about letting me
keep the Staff,

08:40.215 --> 08:46.177
just tell me now
so I can figure out what--

08:46.221 --> 08:49.311
Oh, no. No, no.
The Staff, it chose you.

08:49.354 --> 08:52.227
It did.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.229
I'm done being Starman.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.500
What is it?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.155
I thought that you were excited
that Sylvester's here.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.157
No, I-I am, Pat.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.333
I just...

09:11.376 --> 09:13.727
What?

09:13.770 --> 09:15.424
He put a lot of hard work

09:15.467 --> 09:17.861
into building
that display case.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.341
And then he was talking

09:19.384 --> 09:21.604
about the bond
he has with the Staff.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.390
Yeah. But see, I think that's
exactly why he can show you

09:25.434 --> 09:28.437
how to do things with it
that I never could.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.874
I think that there's
a real opportunity here, Court,

09:30.918 --> 09:32.702
for you to learn
directly from him.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.704
He really knows
what he's doing.

09:34.748 --> 09:38.752
And while he teaches you
how to be a better Stargirl,

09:38.795 --> 09:40.754
I can help him figure out

09:40.797 --> 09:44.105
how to navigate
his life post-Starman.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.239
Welcome home, neighbors!

09:48.283 --> 09:49.850
- Howdy!
- Hi!

09:49.893 --> 09:51.242
Thank you.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.983
Oh, please tell Barbara

09:53.027 --> 09:55.464
we have got to get together
for coffee.

09:55.507 --> 09:58.032
I will.
She'll be thrilled.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.991
She won't.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.340
Boy...

10:13.090 --> 10:14.614
- Hey, what are you doing?

10:14.657 --> 10:15.702
What are you doing?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.791
Well, I'm locking the door.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.315
We have to learn
to trust them.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.056
Trust who?
The Crocks?

10:22.099 --> 10:23.666
Are you kidding me?

10:23.710 --> 10:25.407
They're not our enemies anymore.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.236
Hey, you're very trusting,
all right?

10:28.279 --> 10:29.629
And that's a great quality,

10:29.672 --> 10:31.456
but when it comes
to people like that,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.197
you gotta be very careful.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.287
We can really make
a difference in the world, Pat.

10:36.331 --> 10:40.161
We can help the bad guys
break... good.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.598
If we could all learn
to trust each other,

10:42.642 --> 10:45.253
not only would we
be better people for it,

10:45.296 --> 10:48.691
but no matter what evil
comes our way next,

10:48.735 --> 10:51.868
if we're on the same side
like we were against Eclipso,

10:51.912 --> 10:53.217
we'll be unstoppable.

10:53.261 --> 10:56.264
- Well, hold on.

10:56.307 --> 10:59.093
- It's locked.
- Yeah.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.398
Ah, yes.

11:00.442 --> 11:03.358
Good day, Miss Whitmore,
Mr. Dugan.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.316
I am here to make amends.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.670
Oh, and I brought your mail.

11:10.713 --> 11:14.412
Now, I realize my reappearance
in Blue Valley is,

11:14.456 --> 11:19.679
well, a surprise to you both
and maybe even a worry.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.638
I'm sorry to admit,
but, well,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.596
I've come straight
to your doorstep

11:24.640 --> 11:28.035
to assure you fine folks
that my intentions

11:28.078 --> 11:30.298
are only to follow
the wonderful examples

11:30.341 --> 11:33.475
that the others in my ilk
have set forth.

11:33.518 --> 11:37.131
See, Gambler, old buddy,
the thing is,

11:37.174 --> 11:41.570
you're not afforded the same
courtesy that other people are.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.312
Why ever not, Mr. Dugan?

11:44.355 --> 11:46.053
Well,
while you were on the run,

11:46.096 --> 11:48.055
everyone else helped us
save Blue Valley.

11:48.098 --> 11:53.060
Yes, I heard all about
that devilish business

11:53.103 --> 11:55.410
with the Black Diamond
and Eclipso.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.151
Ooh.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.282
Heard it from who?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.676
"From whom" would be proper.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.723
Needless to say, I--

12:03.766 --> 12:07.770
well, I've had a change
of heart myself as of late.

12:07.814 --> 12:11.295
And what exactly caused this
so-called change of heart?

12:11.339 --> 12:15.343
Well, trying to hide traces
of me in the digital world,

12:15.386 --> 12:18.781
I uncovered a birth certificate
from some years back.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.522
I have a daughter.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.003
Her name's Becky.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.440
Her mother gave her up
for adoption,

12:25.483 --> 12:28.835
so I'm having trouble
locating her.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.881
You wanna be a father?

12:31.925 --> 12:33.230
Is that what you're saying?

12:33.274 --> 12:36.712
Oh, I have
no delusions there.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.105
I am not a role model

12:38.148 --> 12:41.151
for anyone to look up to,
not like you.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.674
No, sir.

12:42.718 --> 12:45.721
I know that.

12:45.765 --> 12:52.336
But what I can do is apologize
to the people I've wronged

12:52.380 --> 12:54.991
and become a productive member
of this community

12:55.035 --> 12:56.819
in hopes that...

12:59.561 --> 13:01.955
In hopes that
if my daughter wants

13:01.998 --> 13:05.262
to have some kind of
relationship with me someday,

13:05.306 --> 13:09.049
well then, maybe
I'll be worthy of one.

13:09.092 --> 13:13.836
And why does she
matter to you so much?

13:18.667 --> 13:23.890
My own father abandoned me, and...

13:27.458 --> 13:30.853
It put me on a bad path,
I think.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.681
I don't want my daughter
to go through life

13:32.724 --> 13:36.380
thinking I abandoned her.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.165
I want her to know I love her.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.213
That's all.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.520
I want her to know I love her.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.285
Hey.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.895
Hey!
Morning, bud.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.376
Crusher, it's 5:30
in the morning.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.291
What are you doing
in my kitchen?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.989
- I'm making breakfast.

14:20.033 --> 14:24.037
What you are actually
doing, it's trespassing.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.429
You're gonna love this.

14:25.473 --> 14:29.085
Wheatgrass, spirulina,
bee pollen,

14:29.129 --> 14:32.610
and just a pinch
of testosterone.

14:32.654 --> 14:33.785
No offense.
- Yeah.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.787
My testosterone's fine, thanks.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.224
And I'm good on the juice.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.183
So tell me:

14:40.227 --> 14:42.185
what was that putz
doing here yesterday?

14:42.229 --> 14:43.317
Who?

14:43.360 --> 14:44.535
The Gambler.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.102
Yeah?

14:46.146 --> 14:47.799
Why didn't you and the kid
lock him up?

14:47.843 --> 14:49.062
Hey, we're dealing with it.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.759
Let me tell you something.

14:50.802 --> 14:54.502
That Kentucky-fried felon
is not to be trusted.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.243
No matter what he says,

14:56.286 --> 14:58.941
he's only ever been
in this life for the money.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.943
That's all he cares about.
- Thanks for the intel.

15:00.987 --> 15:04.251
Um, what is going on?

15:04.294 --> 15:06.296
Oh, Crusher broke in.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.950
Door was unlocked.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.299
I'm just trying
to get your old man

15:09.343 --> 15:10.692
back into the program.

15:10.735 --> 15:11.823
Okay, listen.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.913
Juicer.
That's on us.

15:13.956 --> 15:17.220
First one's free, and I'll
see you at Ripped City.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.527
Grand reopening today, huh?
- Yeah.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.964
- New bod, new life.
- Stop. Stop.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.097
Hey, remember what happened
last time we fought.

15:24.140 --> 15:27.100
- Yeah.
- Almost killed you.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.493
You wish.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.973
Whoo!

15:31.017 --> 15:33.019
Later!

15:33.062 --> 15:37.632
We gotta start
locking the doors, all right?

15:56.694 --> 15:59.001
Um...

15:59.045 --> 16:04.615
Maria, my dear, I-I--I'm afraid
it's still not quite right.

16:04.659 --> 16:05.965
Darn it.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.444
And I think
you still might be

16:07.488 --> 16:10.665
scalding the tea
just a touch.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.322
But I do appreciate the effort.

16:26.115 --> 16:30.598
Steven Sharp,
The Gambler.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.779
Good morning, Mr. Swift.

16:37.822 --> 16:40.738
Do you mind if I sit?
- Yes, I do. Very much.

16:40.782 --> 16:44.481
Well, I'll only take
but a moment of your time.

16:44.525 --> 16:47.310
Now, before we begin
this parlay of sorts,

16:47.354 --> 16:50.052
well, it occurred to me
that I've never told you

16:50.096 --> 16:51.923
how much I admire
your sophisticated

16:51.967 --> 16:53.490
and refined sense of style.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.885
What do you want?

16:56.928 --> 16:58.887
- To reform.
- Oh...

16:58.930 --> 17:01.890
Well, like you,
for my daughter.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.065
Her name is Becky.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.545
You have no daughter

17:04.588 --> 17:06.373
like you have no scruples.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.983
You're not fooling anyone.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.769
So I suggest
you leave Blue Valley

17:11.813 --> 17:14.120
before Courtney Whitmore
and the others find out

17:14.163 --> 17:18.950
whatever it is
you're really up to.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.648
Or I do.

17:22.432 --> 17:26.306
Well, I assure you,
Mr. Swift,

17:26.349 --> 17:28.090
my daughter is very real.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.265
Mm.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.440
Well, I've simply come here

17:30.484 --> 17:32.225
to extend an apology

17:32.268 --> 17:34.357
for our disagreements
of the past.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.272
Now, when you left the ISA,

17:36.316 --> 17:39.101
I'm certain that me draining
all your bank accounts

17:39.145 --> 17:40.755
was displeasing, to say...

17:44.150 --> 17:46.021
Go.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.980
Yes, but of course.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.249
I do hope you find
a good cup of tea.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.232
This is what happens when you
forgive one of the bad guys.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.668
They all come running
for handouts.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.148
Okay, we don't know
if The Gambler

18:26.192 --> 18:27.280
is up to something bad.

18:27.323 --> 18:28.672
Of course we don't, Court.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.065
He's not gonna tell us.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.155
None of them are,
especially Cindy.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.070
She stabbed me in the back,
and she'll do it to you too

18:35.114 --> 18:37.725
first chance she gets.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.249
I have enough problems
with my parents.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.251
If they catch me sneaking
out of the house again,

18:42.295 --> 18:44.688
I wouldn't be surprised if they
ship me off to boarding school.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.865
I told you guys, yellow
and black are Rick's colors.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.216
I like my cape.
I don't need a new costume.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.392
<i>Just take another look
at the design.</i>

18:52.435 --> 18:54.045
<i>Laser lemon.</i>

18:54.089 --> 18:59.007
<i>It just--it sounds
so superhero!</i>

18:59.050 --> 19:00.530
I gotta go, okay?

19:00.574 --> 19:02.445
Love you. Bye. <i>
- Okay, honey. Love you.</i>

19:02.489 --> 19:03.881
<i>Bye. Have a great day--
- Have a great one, Be--</i>

19:06.928 --> 19:09.409
Shouldn't have given them
this number.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.672
Yum. What's that?

19:11.715 --> 19:14.196
Oh, crispy chicken
over turmeric,

19:14.240 --> 19:15.676
lemon, cabbage, and peas.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.721
My parents made it.
Breakfast too.

19:17.765 --> 19:18.809
Mmm.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.683
Hey, guys.
all: Hey.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.512
- No luck with Grundy, huh?

19:27.427 --> 19:29.037
I've buried him everywhere

19:29.080 --> 19:31.300
The Shade's told me to.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.650
"In a clear field
under a full moon.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.609
Between two oak trees."

19:35.652 --> 19:38.089
Whatever he says,
but nothing ever happens.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.527
Maybe The Shade is lying.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.746
Maybe Grundy's
never coming back.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.228
Hi.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.666
Welcome back to school, JSA.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.890
Hi, Cindy.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.283
I guess me sitting here means

19:57.326 --> 20:01.243
this isn't the losers' table
anymore.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.375
It never was.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.509
So... wow.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.903
All five of us here.

20:10.818 --> 20:13.516
Um, so I wanna start
this team meeting

20:13.560 --> 20:15.649
by talking about teamwork.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.781
Oh, I-I made some notes.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.219
- Ooh.
- Uh...

20:20.262 --> 20:25.049
First, we have to wipe
the slate clean, all of us.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.530
If I can look beyond the past
with Cindy,

20:27.574 --> 20:28.662
so can all of you.

20:28.705 --> 20:29.837
Not necessarily.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.753
Get over your trauma already.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.407
We don't want you here.
Get it?

20:34.450 --> 20:37.105
- Yolanda, we all agreed to--
- No, Court.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.586
You and Beth agreed
to invite her into the JSA.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.588
Yolanda and I, we voted no.

20:41.631 --> 20:45.635
- Oh, so I'm the tiebreaker.
- You don't get a vote.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.768
- Can I get back to my notes?
- Yeah.

20:47.811 --> 20:50.553
Can we just skip down
to "Starman's back"?

20:50.597 --> 20:52.947
'Cause I'm dying to know
what the deal is.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.558
That's the real elephant
in the room.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.908
Isn't it, gang?

21:03.174 --> 21:07.396
It's great
that Starman is back.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.313
We all thought he was dead
like Dr. McNider.

21:11.357 --> 21:14.403
So how lucky are we?

21:14.447 --> 21:15.839
He thinks
the Staff did it some--

21:15.883 --> 21:19.626
What about the Staff?
What now?

21:19.669 --> 21:21.323
Sylvester's gonna show me
how to use it.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.020
But you already know
how to use it.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.979
Well, apparently
it has a few more tricks

21:25.022 --> 21:28.025
up its proverbial sleeve,
so that's exciting.

21:28.069 --> 21:30.985
Yeah! Go, team!
Whoo!

21:31.028 --> 21:32.682
Artemis,
what are you talking about?

21:32.726 --> 21:35.163
They're losers.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.470
What was that
"go team" about?

21:37.513 --> 21:38.688
I don't know.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.386
Are you sure?

21:40.429 --> 21:43.127
Because it seems like
anyone can join the JSA now.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.573
I'll see you later then, teammate.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.666
I'll wait till she gets back.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.115
Pat. Okay.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.944
What you did with the
Rocket Racer was unbelievable.

22:16.987 --> 22:20.034
But this robot?

22:20.077 --> 22:22.384
I mean, it's spectacular.
- Thanks.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.735
If the rest of the JSA
were alive to see this,

22:25.779 --> 22:29.043
I mean, they'd be begging you
to sit at the table.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.741
Well, I put a lot
of work into it.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.439
Yeah, but you need
more recognition.

22:33.482 --> 22:36.833
I mean, look at this bad boy.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.705
You gotta show me
what it can do.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.403
I wanna see this sucker fly.

22:41.447 --> 22:44.798
I'm dying to.
Please, for old times' sake.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.280
Let's do it.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.369
- Great.
- Okay.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.413
I'm gonna grab the Staff.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.980
The Staff?

22:53.023 --> 22:56.287
Well, Pat, how am I
gonna keep up with it?

22:56.331 --> 22:57.506
It'll be quick.
- Yeah.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.073
Sylvester, just--
- Oh, and Pat.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.162
And I think I forgot
to say this outright,

23:01.205 --> 23:04.818
but thanks for giving me
a place to stay

23:04.861 --> 23:06.646
and to make me feel welcome.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.996
- Of course.
- I really mean it.

23:09.039 --> 23:15.350
To see you with your family,
succeeding and happy,

23:15.394 --> 23:17.352
makes me happy too.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.226
Thanks, Sylvester.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.855
Hello, Barbara.

23:41.898 --> 23:45.641
Paula, what are you
doing here?

23:50.429 --> 23:51.952
I need to talk to you.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.345
- About what?
- My daughter.

23:54.389 --> 23:59.046
I realize Artemis has a history
with Courtney and her friends,

23:59.089 --> 24:00.439
like us with you,

24:00.482 --> 24:03.485
but she desperately
wants to join

24:03.529 --> 24:09.360
the... Justice Society
of America.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.450
And if she wants that, so do I.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.063
Oh.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.021
I just hope Courtney
doesn't hold grudges

24:18.065 --> 24:19.501
or punish her

24:19.545 --> 24:21.895
for the past actions
of myself and my husband

24:21.938 --> 24:24.854
'cause that'd be a real shame,

24:24.898 --> 24:30.469
potentially
with real consequences.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.995
Well, who's in the JSA
isn't up to me.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.475
It's up to them.

24:38.607 --> 24:43.743
So Artemis,
she's such a great kid.

24:45.527 --> 24:49.836
She'll prove herself
if she has to.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.185
Just watch.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.873
Where are you, Becky?

26:40.903 --> 26:44.080
- Race you.
- You're on!

26:44.124 --> 26:46.256
Come on, S.T.R.I.P.E.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.475
Catch up!

26:53.002 --> 26:54.613
That poor guy looked like
he was gonna have

26:54.656 --> 26:56.353
a heart attack!
- Oh, my Lord!

26:56.397 --> 26:58.051
I couldn't believe the look
on that pilot's face.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.835
Yeah, because there was
a huge robot staring at him.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.055
But next time, I take the nose,
you take the rear.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.144
'Cause--no, no, because I was--
- Hey, don't.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.711
Don't blame yourself,
'cause that thing

27:05.754 --> 27:07.321
was heavier
than we both thought.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.715
I mean, it was a 7.7--
- Hi.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.238
Oh, hey.
Howdy, folks.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.979
- You took the Staff?
- Yeah.

27:13.022 --> 27:14.633
And it is way past dinner, Pat.
- Yeah.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.591
I wanted to see
Stripesy's mech in action.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.593
And then a plane
was in trouble.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.942
- Big plane.
- Huge!

27:19.986 --> 27:21.727
- Jumbo jet.
- Yeah, and he caught it.

27:21.770 --> 27:25.078
You told Courtney you weren't
gonna be Starman anymore.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.083
- I'm sorry about that, Court.
- Nope.

27:30.126 --> 27:33.521
No, no, no. It was my idea
to take out the Staff.

27:36.089 --> 27:42.748
Well, it's great, what
you both did saving a plane.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.489
It's amazing, really.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.018
Here. Please.

28:00.983 --> 28:04.857
I'm, uh, sorry
for causing trouble.

28:04.900 --> 28:08.599
It's not my intention to
be anything but helpful here.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.521
You know, he actually means
it, 'cause he never apologizes.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.741
All right?
And it's my fault too.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.569
That's okay, Pat. Really.

28:21.612 --> 28:25.529
It sounds like you both had
a lot of fun, and I'm glad.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.184
Yeah. I mean,
we hadn't gotten to do that

28:28.228 --> 28:31.927
for a long time, but...

28:31.971 --> 28:33.320
I'm gonna get to work
on dinner.

28:33.363 --> 28:34.538
I can tell everybody's hungry.

28:36.366 --> 28:37.454
This is gonna be great.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.934
Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.936
Okay. Mike, grab
that seasoning for me.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.808
Seasoning?
What seasoning?

28:42.851 --> 28:44.244
What seasonings
do we even have?

28:44.287 --> 28:46.942
When do I help you cook?

29:01.087 --> 29:02.610
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:05.656 --> 29:06.745
Are you okay?

29:17.538 --> 29:20.584
I lied to you.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.761
I did come back for the Staff.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.287
I thought so.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.158
You could see
right through me, huh?

29:29.202 --> 29:32.945
I just knew
there had to be something.

29:36.339 --> 29:40.866
You know, when I came back
to life, which...

29:43.216 --> 29:47.611
I realized I didn't have
a life to come back to.

29:47.655 --> 29:50.136
I mean, my sister died.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.920
My parents, who never won

29:51.964 --> 29:53.879
a Mom and Dad
of the Year award,

29:53.922 --> 29:54.967
I mean, they're gone too.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.056
And I never married.

29:57.099 --> 29:59.536
No kids.

29:59.580 --> 30:03.236
All I ever had was Starman.

30:05.760 --> 30:12.114
So I don't know
what I would do without it.

30:12.158 --> 30:15.204
So you do want
the Staff back?

30:20.035 --> 30:21.210
No.

30:23.734 --> 30:26.694
I just thought that Pat
was holding the Staff

30:26.737 --> 30:29.479
and that was that.

30:29.523 --> 30:35.572
Then I saw you with the Staff,
and... it chose you.

30:35.616 --> 30:39.794
I mean,
I'd never ask for it back,

30:39.838 --> 30:43.754
'cause you're the future,
not me.

30:43.798 --> 30:45.669
I know that.

30:47.584 --> 30:52.546
But I can train you.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.072
I can show you
some pretty great tricks.

30:57.116 --> 31:00.380
And after that, I don't know.

31:03.339 --> 31:06.212
Wait.

31:06.255 --> 31:10.825
The Staff still works for you,
and I think it means something.

31:10.869 --> 31:15.874
I don't know what,
but I can't just ignore that.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.788
So...

31:20.443 --> 31:22.532
What if we made
some kind of arrangement?

31:22.576 --> 31:24.273
An arrangement?

31:24.317 --> 31:26.754
When I'm at school,
the Staff is yours,

31:26.797 --> 31:29.888
and when I'm out,
I'll take it back.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.019
Like a tag team.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.586
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.893
That's better for everybody, really.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.808
- Courtney.
- That settles it.

31:37.852 --> 31:40.942
Look out, world.
Starman is back.

31:49.603 --> 31:53.128
That sounds pretty cool, right?

31:53.172 --> 31:55.261
- Yeah.

31:55.304 --> 31:58.090
Okay.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.875
Wow.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.877
Starman's back.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.709
- Hey, Beth.
- Court.

32:08.752 --> 32:09.797
There's trouble.

32:18.675 --> 32:21.026
- There they are.
- Move it.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.723
Open it!
Hurry up!

32:22.766 --> 32:24.159
I know you have the key.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.856
Hurry up now!

32:25.900 --> 32:28.076
Five guys
and dollar-sign masks?

32:28.120 --> 32:29.338
You needed all of us here
for this?

32:29.382 --> 32:30.731
If you don't like it,
go home.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.167
Hey.
Someone is in trouble, okay?

32:32.211 --> 32:33.647
We do not have time for this.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.787
- Stop! Whoo! <i>
- ♪ Everybody dance now</i>

32:43.831 --> 32:45.964
- Hey!
- JSA! Let's go!

33:00.108 --> 33:02.023
Who's next?

33:05.853 --> 33:08.247
How's that for a tryout?

33:09.639 --> 33:11.946
Artemis, one!
Bad guys, zero!

33:38.451 --> 33:40.235
<i>"Dearest Becky,</i>

33:40.279 --> 33:43.325
<i>"My darling daughter,</i>

33:43.369 --> 33:44.892
<i>"I write to you today</i>

33:44.935 --> 33:48.026
<i>"to apologize
for the years lost.</i>

33:48.069 --> 33:52.769
<i>"I wasn't there for your birth
or your birthdays.</i>

33:52.813 --> 33:55.772
<i>"I wasn't there for you.</i>

33:55.816 --> 33:58.949
<i>"I wish I could offer
more of an explanation</i>

33:58.993 --> 34:01.648
<i>for my past errant ways."</i>

34:03.693 --> 34:06.305
So this is where
you guys hang out?

34:06.348 --> 34:09.395
Your stepfather's
greasy garage?

34:09.438 --> 34:12.093
Well, it's the only place
big enough to keep S.T.R.I.P.E.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.791
It smells like
a gas station bathroom.

34:14.835 --> 34:17.359
Are you gonna complain
about everything?

34:17.403 --> 34:20.319
Well, we could meet
at my house,

34:20.362 --> 34:24.236
where there's
comfortable chairs and wine.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.325
We don't drink on the job.

34:26.368 --> 34:29.458
We don't drink.
Not 21.

34:29.502 --> 34:32.505
Oh, God.
Could this get any more lame?

34:35.551 --> 34:38.119
Okay.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.165
Here.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.992
The criminals that hijacked
the truck tonight

34:42.036 --> 34:43.733
are called the No Limit Gang.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.909
They used to work for
The Gambler back in the day.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.305
I'm trying to determine
if they were all in

34:50.349 --> 34:52.220
on the robbery together.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.875
Come on. You think this
is all just some coincidence?

34:54.918 --> 34:57.007
The Gambler shows up
in Blue Valley

34:57.051 --> 34:59.793
and his gang
a few miles outside of it?

34:59.836 --> 35:01.186
Well, bad guys
like The Gambler

35:01.229 --> 35:04.058
never really change,
now, do they?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.365
This should all be done
in about an hour.

35:06.408 --> 35:09.672
Yeah, no, this
is beyond boring.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.935
Call me when something
exciting happens, kay?

35:14.155 --> 35:17.898
Cindy, just--

35:22.337 --> 35:23.991
The JSA isn't gonna work

35:24.034 --> 35:26.385
if you let people like
Cindy Burman on the team.

35:26.428 --> 35:29.257
Screw Cindy Burman.
Let's go after The Gambler.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.390
He's guilty.
We all already know this.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.132
Court, sorry,
but this little experiment

35:34.175 --> 35:38.614
where we hang out
with supervillains, it's over.

36:00.506 --> 36:03.335
Ice cold,
just how you like it.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.466
Thanks.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.251
- What a night.
- Mm.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.782
That Courtney,
she's something else.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.000
I know it.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.048
And getting you and I both
back into the game?

36:21.091 --> 36:25.052
Pfft, amazing.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.923
You gotta make
the most of it.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.838
You get a second chance, right?

36:33.191 --> 36:37.238
Second chance
like the Crocks?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.545
Or The Shade?

36:39.588 --> 36:41.199
Dragon King's daughter?

36:41.242 --> 36:43.723
Or The Gambler?

36:43.766 --> 36:47.205
Well, I mean,
Courtney believes we should.

36:47.248 --> 36:51.078
And well, so far, her heart,
it hasn't steered us wrong yet.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.428
Look, I'm not saying
she's wrong.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.083
These are predators
we're dealing with.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.563
Every one of 'em.

37:02.916 --> 37:07.137
Even so, to second chances.

37:07.181 --> 37:08.400
- Second chances.
- Yeah.

37:13.318 --> 37:17.191
And hey, if I'm really back,

37:17.235 --> 37:19.411
that means you're officially
my sidekick again.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.110
Sidekick?

37:23.153 --> 37:24.981
Starman and Stripesy.

37:26.635 --> 37:29.029
I've also just been
going by just S.T.R.I.P.E.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.205
It's an acronym
for Subatomic Tactical...

37:31.249 --> 37:34.904
- Gonna be fun.
- Robot Internet Pat Enhancer.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.519
- Hmm.
- Hey.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.528
The mustache is great.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.576
You think so?

39:07.823 --> 39:09.434
- See?

39:12.915 --> 39:14.352
<i>Isn't it weird
how I was dead?</i>

40:42.570 --> 40:44.137
I've been trying to see
if The Gambler's been

40:44.180 --> 40:46.226
in communication
with his old gang,

40:46.269 --> 40:48.750
but so far, nothing.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.839
They could be working
without him.

40:50.883 --> 40:52.275
I doubt it.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.321
We're gonna wreck him.

40:54.364 --> 40:57.890
We're going to give him
an opportunity to explain.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.979
That's all.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.415
Why are you so intent
on believing

41:01.459 --> 41:03.765
any of them have changed,
Court?

41:03.809 --> 41:06.464
Why are you giving someone
like The Gambler a chance?

41:09.075 --> 41:15.734
Because he's trying to be
better for his daughter.

41:17.866 --> 41:21.783
The Gambler,
of all people,

41:21.827 --> 41:24.525
is a better dad
than mine ever was.

41:32.141 --> 41:34.274
Oh, my!
What the heck?

41:41.150 --> 41:43.239
- Oh, my gosh.
- Did you do that?

41:43.283 --> 41:46.852
- What?
- What the heck is going on?

41:53.902 --> 41:55.861
I didn't do it.

42:20.755 --> 42:22.148
Greg, move your head.

42:22.191 --> 42:23.715
<i>Mad Ghost.</i>
