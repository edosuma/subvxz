WEBVTT

00:05.240 --> 00:06.679
Let's hide.
-What?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.279
Let's hide.

00:08.519 --> 00:10.720
No one will find us here,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.720
and we won't have to do anything, ever.
-Great idea.

00:15.039 --> 00:16.120
Excuse me,

00:16.960 --> 00:18.679
I need you for a moment,
it's urgent.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.320
We have the play,
we'll let you know.

00:21.359 --> 00:23.320
You knew about "The Seagull"?
-Yes.

00:23.359 --> 00:24.320
And didn't think to tell me?

00:24.399 --> 00:26.160
I can't imagine

00:26.239 --> 00:28.000
not getting this part.
I'll die.

00:28.199 --> 00:30.559
Nina in Chekhov's "The Seagull,"

00:30.679 --> 00:33.320
it's the role of a lifetime.
It's 'IT'.

00:33.439 --> 00:35.320
Shut the fuck up already.
-What?

00:37.240 --> 00:38.439
I can't stand her,

00:38.479 --> 00:40.159
why did she barge in on us?

00:40.399 --> 00:42.320
I think we need couples' therapy.

00:43.079 --> 00:44.679
What's so funny?
-What's therapy got to do with it?

00:44.719 --> 00:46.600
It helps lots of couples.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.320
Tell me what you want
out of this relationship.

00:50.439 --> 00:51.640
Three, two, one...

00:51.679 --> 00:54.000
I want a baby.
-I want to break up.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.719
Listen, I need some air,

00:59.000 --> 01:00.719
I need to clear my head
and figure out who I am without you.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.640
"Loved your play! Call us
so we can proceed."

01:22.079 --> 01:24.159
Dor, come help me.

01:33.439 --> 01:36.319
Are you following me?
-Vera, I want to talk to you.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.599
Either you're filming
or you're pregnant.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.480
I'm getting married.
-Congratulations.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.159
Mind if I get out of the car?
-Oh, sorry.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.560
Sorry.
-What did I tell you about getting married?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.439
Marry into money.
-Right.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.319
Because I won't support your children.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.319
But have a kid,
it won't leave you, a husband will.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.319
OK.
-But not at the same time as Elinor,

01:57.439 --> 02:00.079
don't leave me without actresses.
-OK.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.000
Get pregnant,
but take turns.

02:02.439 --> 02:03.480
Is it true, Vera?

02:03.599 --> 02:05.079
We're putting on "The Seagull"?

02:05.239 --> 02:06.319
What's in it for me?

02:06.400 --> 02:09.680
If we're doing "The Seagull,"
I want to play Nina.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.120
And I want someone
to give the theater half a billion.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.120
How about that?
-That's it,

02:15.199 --> 02:16.319
it's my turn now. You know it.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.319
And don't even think

02:18.439 --> 02:22.240
of casting someone else.
-Oh, the back-up dancer wants to sing?

02:22.360 --> 02:25.159
Makes me feel like
offering the part to Elinor...

02:25.280 --> 02:28.639
You know, I got a scholarship for doing
Nina's monologue at school.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.400
Morning, Tali.
-Hi, Tali.

02:31.479 --> 02:33.639
Show me yesterday's numbers.
-With pleasure.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.280
I'll see how pleasant they are.

02:36.639 --> 02:39.159
"Family Dinner",
full house.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.639
"Salt of the Earth",
full house both times.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.400
This crap actually sells.

02:44.479 --> 02:46.400
"Richard II",
one quarter full.

02:46.719 --> 02:49.319
Shakespeare in this place
is like lipstick on a pig.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.280
Tali, no more freebies,
everyone pays. Everyone.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.280
Of course, we always...
-Good.

02:55.319 --> 02:56.479
Remind the girls.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.280
Do you know what it would mean
for us to do Chekhov?

02:59.479 --> 03:02.080
I'm putting on "The Seagull"
because I still remember

03:02.240 --> 03:04.080
where I came from
and why I run a theater.

03:04.159 --> 03:06.080
But there's a greater demand
for hemorrhoids.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.719
So, because I love you,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.639
I'm giving you the lead in
a new comedy.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.599
You'll kiss my feet when you make
enough money for a new house.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.439
I don't want it,
I want to be Nina.

03:17.479 --> 03:21.000
You're as stupid as a cow
standing in front of a train.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.599
Why did I come to this theater?

03:22.719 --> 03:24.000
I told my agent,

03:24.080 --> 03:26.159
no more TV and teen shows,

03:26.240 --> 03:28.080
I'm aiming for quality roles.

03:28.159 --> 03:31.080
Vera, I came here to do the lead roles.
Period.

03:31.159 --> 03:32.159
I am Nina!

03:32.240 --> 03:33.319
You're not.
-I am Nina.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.479
You're not.
-I am Nina!

03:34.560 --> 03:35.479
Done?
-Yes.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.479
Good.
Nina is for someone who's depressed,

03:38.639 --> 03:41.159
morbid, and always wanting
what she doesn't have.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.280
You're pretty, happy, rich,
you're getting married.

03:44.319 --> 03:45.560
You have everything you want.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.439
What do you need this for?

03:47.680 --> 03:50.639
Come read this comedy,
"One + One,"

03:50.719 --> 03:52.400
I think you'll love it.

03:52.479 --> 03:54.680
Vera, I'm not just anyone.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.400
And then we'll see, OK?

03:59.719 --> 04:01.280
Come here. (in Russian)

04:01.319 --> 04:03.280
Pretty, pretty girl.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.400
You're great in...

04:12.560 --> 04:13.680
"Love Under Fire."

04:14.240 --> 04:15.479
Thanks.
You're from marketing?

04:16.680 --> 04:20.079
No, I'm a director.
-Great. Good luck.

04:22.439 --> 04:23.600
Thanks.

05:01.279 --> 05:02.279
Excuse me?

05:02.680 --> 05:03.959
Excuse me,

05:05.199 --> 05:07.279
Iris, the woman I was
with last time,

05:07.399 --> 05:08.639
did she say if she's coming?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.279
Don't know.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.079
OK, thanks.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.399
She's here.

05:43.319 --> 05:44.279
Hey.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.240
Hi.

05:47.319 --> 05:51.439
She's busy, so we have a few minutes
to figure out what to tell her.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.560
Great.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.279
How you doing?

06:09.480 --> 06:10.959
Great.

06:11.759 --> 06:14.120
Good, good.

06:16.279 --> 06:19.480
Yes. Truth is...

06:19.759 --> 06:21.600
I'm great.

06:23.959 --> 06:25.079
And you?

06:27.439 --> 06:29.360
I'm very...

06:29.480 --> 06:31.279
Also, you know...

06:32.279 --> 06:33.480
What?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.279
You know... it's weird,

06:38.399 --> 06:39.279
but I'm fine.

06:42.279 --> 06:43.240
Good.

06:44.319 --> 06:45.079
Excited.

06:46.519 --> 06:49.279
Yeah, it's an opportunity...
-No, I mean,

06:49.319 --> 06:51.480
we left here feeling shitty,

06:52.040 --> 06:55.040
and it turns out...
you never know.

06:56.519 --> 07:00.079
I want you to see this,
before we go in,

07:00.560 --> 07:03.120
I put together some stuff...

07:03.240 --> 07:06.360
all sorts of ideas
and references,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.279
to put us in the right
headspace for the meeting.

07:09.079 --> 07:13.360
So for the stage I'm thinking...

07:14.279 --> 07:16.079
make it like our apartment.

07:16.319 --> 07:19.079
And the actors, can wear pyjamas.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.600
It's a new concept I had.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.439
I like it.
-What's with the shirt?

07:24.040 --> 07:26.600
What?
-What's with the shirt?

07:28.639 --> 07:30.279
I slept at my mom's.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.639
I didn't take any clothes,

07:34.199 --> 07:37.959
so I took her shirt.
Do I look stupid?

07:38.079 --> 07:39.560
Where's Vera?
I want to talk to her.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.759
Unbelievable!

07:41.040 --> 07:42.759
Amateurs.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.959
Fucking amateurs!

07:45.040 --> 07:46.959
I want to talk to Vera now!

07:47.600 --> 07:48.439
She's in a meeting...

07:48.480 --> 07:49.639
Bring her out!

07:50.040 --> 07:53.079
I've been on this stage for 28 years,
and my son...

07:53.240 --> 07:56.480
has to pay for a fucking ticket?

07:56.519 --> 07:58.639
He grew up in this theater!

07:59.360 --> 08:01.279
I changed his diapers backstage!

08:01.439 --> 08:04.240
Who asked him to pay?

08:04.319 --> 08:06.480
Who was selling tickets?
-They told us,

08:06.560 --> 08:08.360
no more freebies.
-Who's they?

08:08.439 --> 08:10.079
Don't you have a mind of your own?

08:10.160 --> 08:12.079
What's going on? Are you crazy?
Shlomo!

08:12.160 --> 08:14.439
My son came
to his father's theater...

08:14.519 --> 08:16.120
Shlomo!
-They didn't recognize him,

08:16.240 --> 08:17.480
and he had to pay!
-Come here.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.560
Does that make sense to you?

08:18.639 --> 08:19.639
-Shlomo...
-Don't Shlomo me.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.199
Shlomo.
-Don't Shlomo me.

08:21.279 --> 08:23.279
Shlomo...
-Don't Shlomo me.

08:23.279 --> 08:25.519
Come with me.
-I'm not going on today, you hear me?

08:26.600 --> 08:29.360
You've all completely lost it.
-All right.

08:29.439 --> 08:31.680
I've performed with the greats...
-Shlomo...

08:31.959 --> 08:33.200
when you couldn't speak our language...

08:33.279 --> 08:35.240
Come with me.
-Not a single word!

08:36.240 --> 08:37.960
Karina, go refresh yourself.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.759
You're here for me?

08:40.559 --> 08:42.480
The new comedy, of course.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.360
Listen,

08:44.440 --> 08:46.039
you'll have to wait.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.759
I have to calm down a great actor.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.279
Karina, get them coffee.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.519
Right, never mind.
Let's just do this,

08:56.679 --> 09:01.279
and then you can watch the play.
It's our biggest hit.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.120
Welcome to the theater.

09:07.159 --> 09:10.480
The box office girls
are idiots.

09:10.559 --> 09:12.399
They didn't recognize him.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.080
He said he's my son.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.480
Shlomachka.
-Don't Shlomachka me.

09:15.559 --> 09:17.240
That's my cue. Move!

09:17.519 --> 09:19.039
Oh, darling.

09:19.279 --> 09:21.039
My darling.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.279
Father.

09:24.039 --> 09:28.559
My dear father,
I will do anything you say...

09:28.639 --> 09:31.039
It can be a madhouse here.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.480
It's been a crazy week.
-Yeah, we also... had a crazy week.

09:35.639 --> 09:37.360
But he's terrific,

09:37.440 --> 09:39.960
I saw him in "Richard III"
when I was...

09:40.120 --> 09:43.120
Back to business,
let's draw up your contract,

09:43.240 --> 09:46.120
before you get
any notions of grandeur.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.279
You'll get an advance,

09:48.279 --> 09:50.639
royalties, the usual.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.519
Now let's talk art.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.240
Casting.
Come.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.200
She will play the lead role.

10:04.279 --> 10:08.679
He's smart, from a fine family.
Speaks Latin and Greek.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.360
Who?
-Nadia Comaneci, who? Maya!

10:11.759 --> 10:12.559
Maya Guttman?

10:12.639 --> 10:16.559
Up to you,
but you have to be blind or an idiot

10:16.679 --> 10:18.559
not to cast her.

10:18.639 --> 10:20.639
But you're the so-called "director."
-No...

10:20.759 --> 10:23.120
What's a "director"?
There are no more real "directors".

10:23.240 --> 10:25.080
I...
-Let me finish.

10:25.159 --> 10:28.679
The point is, I can sniff out potential
from a mile away,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.120
and you have it.
I saw your fringe play,

10:32.240 --> 10:33.639
and it was special.
-Thanks.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.120
Out of all the nonsense you did,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.960
and the cluttered stage,
whoever did that set

10:39.039 --> 10:40.399
should have his fingers cut off,

10:40.480 --> 10:45.080
your directing sparkled for a moment.
Sometimes that's enough.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.039
I think that casting Maya

10:49.080 --> 10:51.279
is a wonderful idea.
-What?

10:51.440 --> 10:52.639
No.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.279
She's not who we...

10:57.399 --> 10:58.639
had in mind.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.639
Who did you have in mind?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.480
What?
-Who did you have in mind?

11:05.399 --> 11:09.120
Look, Maya will have to play... me.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.080
We don't exactly...

11:16.360 --> 11:18.279
Have the same issues.

11:18.399 --> 11:20.399
What issues do you have?

11:23.120 --> 11:25.759
It's probably obvious,

11:26.159 --> 11:29.960
but this play is about us,
our relationship.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.240
You're a couple?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.960
Dammit. (in Russian)

11:34.080 --> 11:35.639
We're not a couple.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.120
Not anymore.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.360
Move!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.639
Vera, I'm not doing the comedy.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.519
I asked around,
nobody's heard of the director.

11:46.679 --> 11:49.279
We're finally doing Chekhov and
you want me to do a comedy?

11:49.480 --> 11:50.639
No way.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.360
Father? Father...

11:59.279 --> 12:03.080
Don't worry, she'd love to do your play.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.759
She's beautiful, graceful,
but not for Chekhov.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.279
Your comedy is good for her
and for you.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.600
Her co-star will be
the one from TV,

12:11.080 --> 12:12.480
Ofer Marziano.

12:13.279 --> 12:14.639
After we sell 400 shows,

12:14.759 --> 12:17.080
and you'll have money
to fix your teeth, which you should,

12:17.159 --> 12:18.960
everyone will remember my words.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.399
I know how to make
our audience happy.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.480
We bring television to theater
and theater to television,

12:23.559 --> 12:25.639
and everyones happy.

12:27.399 --> 12:29.600
Excuse me a sec, sorry.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.080
Wait up, where are you going?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.600
I have to pick my mom up
from the club.

12:36.679 --> 12:39.080
You have tons of time. Wait.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.759
I didn't know what to tell her
so I said we're not a couple.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.279
All right? OK?

12:43.399 --> 12:45.759
I'm sorry,
I wasn't going to start explaining...

12:46.000 --> 12:46.960
What?

12:47.120 --> 12:50.200
Do you realize
our dream is coming true?

12:50.279 --> 12:52.279
Don't you get it?

12:52.559 --> 12:55.279
Why did we play pretend at winning
the theater awards all the time

12:55.360 --> 12:56.759
if you're giving up on it now?

12:58.480 --> 13:02.120
You worked on this play for two years.
Two years!

13:02.200 --> 13:04.480
Why did you tell Vera
that Maya's a good idea?

13:04.519 --> 13:07.480
You sold us out.
-Fine, so my ambition...

13:08.120 --> 13:10.279
got the better of me. I'm sorry.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.759
Who did you have in mind?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.480
I don't know, but not Maya Guttman
or... Ofer Marziano.

13:15.559 --> 13:17.679
They got nothing in
common with us.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.080
No problem, I'll tell Vera

13:20.200 --> 13:22.200
that I want someone else.
-OK. -Really, it's fine.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.480
I'll say I want other actors,

13:23.559 --> 13:26.639
but let's think of some names,
so we don't look stupid.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.679
Who do you want?

13:31.039 --> 13:32.519
Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman.

13:33.960 --> 13:34.960
Done.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.120
Gimme a sec, I'll call Meryl.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.480
Let's see if she's in.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.600
Tzutz, when are you coming home?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.399
Tzutz?

13:48.279 --> 13:51.440
Are you coming home?
Now?

13:54.279 --> 13:56.480
Enough with the silence!
Are you coming home? Answer me.

13:56.559 --> 13:59.399
No, I'm not coming home
with you now. No.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.519
So I don't understand,

14:05.440 --> 14:07.120
what are you saying?

14:07.639 --> 14:09.200
That we just be colleagues?

14:09.559 --> 14:12.360
I don't know.
-So think.

14:14.159 --> 14:16.519
You want us to rehearse every day,

14:16.679 --> 14:19.240
and you'll offer constructive
criticism?

14:21.240 --> 14:26.240
We'll look at the set,
that looks like our home,

14:26.399 --> 14:29.039
the actors playing us.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.960
Then you'll go to your place
and I'll go to mine?

14:36.639 --> 14:41.440
I don't know. I didn't think
that far.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.679
You bring Meryl Streep
and Dustin Hoffman,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.039
and I'll do the play.
Otherwise,

14:50.080 --> 14:51.440
don't call me.

15:39.759 --> 15:42.279
Where's Vera?
Did she leave?

15:44.639 --> 15:46.600
Maya, you're back on in four minutes.

15:49.679 --> 15:52.559
Genadi, set change.
The bed!

15:54.600 --> 15:58.600
"Send me a pic"

16:00.639 --> 16:02.519
I don't believe this... Ofer.

16:06.279 --> 16:08.080
What is she thinking?

16:08.279 --> 16:09.480
Why are you here?

16:10.039 --> 16:12.600
For the new play?
-Nice...

16:13.279 --> 16:14.559
Karina, is she here?

16:15.080 --> 16:16.279
No, not right now...

16:16.360 --> 16:19.240
Have you signed the contract?
-I can't talk to you looking like this.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.960
Are you in the middle of a show?
-Listen,

16:21.080 --> 16:22.200
don't do it, Ofer.

16:22.279 --> 16:24.600
They're just using us,
it's a shit play

16:24.679 --> 16:26.480
and we shouldn't do it.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.080
Did you read the play?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.960
Is it like...
"Oh, the gods?"

16:32.039 --> 16:34.279
Some ancient Greek theater?
-No,

16:34.320 --> 16:35.480
it's not "Oh, the gods."

16:35.600 --> 16:38.039
'Oh, the gods' runs for
twenty shows and closes.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.120
This is an original comedy,

16:39.240 --> 16:41.120
which will be a mega-hit
and run forever.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.759
Have you ever been in a hit play?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.120
Maya to the stage.

16:45.279 --> 16:47.279
Maya to the stage.
-Huh?

16:47.480 --> 16:49.600
No, I haven't done theater.
Wasn't that for you?

16:49.679 --> 16:53.080
It means we get in a van at four
every morning for a year

16:53.120 --> 16:55.120
and spend two weeks in one shit hole,
two weeks in another,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.559
another two in god knows where.
All for minimum wage.

16:57.639 --> 16:58.759
So don't sign.

16:59.039 --> 17:00.679
Maya, they called you.
-I heard!

17:01.080 --> 17:03.360
Theater is shit. There's no money,
no perks, no catering.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.559
Bye, don't sign.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.599
Maya, Maya, to the stage.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.279
"A Whore Named Louise"

17:36.000 --> 17:36.640
Hello?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.279
Listen, I'm out.

17:38.319 --> 17:40.240
Where are you?
-At the theater,

17:40.279 --> 17:41.279
but I'm not signing.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.400
It's shit, you hear me?
It's exploitation.

17:44.559 --> 17:47.279
They want to make a killing
off our asses.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.960
You should've told me the truth.

17:49.039 --> 17:50.759
What a mistake,
I should've come.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.079
It doesn't matter,
I'm not signing.

17:53.119 --> 17:54.519
Anyway, I hate theater.

17:54.759 --> 17:57.640
Everyone's wearing
mustaches and wigs.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.680
Remember why you need it?
Do you?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.240
Efi...

18:01.279 --> 18:03.079
No, Ofer,
I want to hear you say it.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.559
Tell me, I want to hear.

18:08.279 --> 18:10.960
Because I was fired from
"Love Under Fire."

18:11.160 --> 18:13.519
Right. And no one
wants to work with you.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.079
So quit playing games.
-I know...

18:17.119 --> 18:18.279
I don't think you do.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.680
I say your name,
they hang up on me.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.200
After what you did, be grateful
you got anything.

18:24.279 --> 18:25.400
Get in there and sign.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.640
Are you there?

18:26.759 --> 18:28.200
Yes, I'm here.

18:29.039 --> 18:30.640
Ofer, you're panicking,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.279
calm yourself down, relax.

18:34.039 --> 18:37.079
Do some pushups,
whatever works for you, OK?

18:40.400 --> 18:43.359
"they're off, now what?"
-"show me" -"no way"

18:45.079 --> 18:46.759
Bitch.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.480
"should I bend over?"

19:33.119 --> 19:34.279
Hello.

19:39.559 --> 19:42.119
You know...
I'm a huge fan.

19:43.079 --> 19:47.119
Thank you.
-I bet everyone says that, but I really...

19:47.279 --> 19:48.680
I grew up on you.

19:50.079 --> 19:52.359
Thank you.
-Thank YOU.

19:53.079 --> 19:55.440
What are you doing here?

19:58.680 --> 20:01.279
I'm an actor.
-I know, I know.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.279
I'm gonna do a play here.
-Oh yeah?

20:07.759 --> 20:11.640
You know, when I was six... or five,

20:12.039 --> 20:14.759
my mom worked like crazy,
bless her,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.279
my piece of shit dad left...
never mind,

20:17.359 --> 20:20.200
she used to sit me down... -Yes?
-With a plate of food,

20:20.519 --> 20:24.440
turned on "Pini the Cop"
and that's it.

20:26.279 --> 20:28.079
You were like my babysitter.

20:30.079 --> 20:33.039
You watched over me.

20:33.359 --> 20:36.079
Don't work here.
It's not worth it.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.759
Why?
-I'm telling you.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.680
If you can,
change careers.

20:40.319 --> 20:43.279
Go into real estate, High-Tech,
anything else.

20:44.079 --> 20:46.279
There's no money in theater.
Never was really,

20:46.359 --> 20:50.119
but at least there was
some respect in it.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.559
They spit in your face
and shit on your head.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.680
No one gives a damn about you.

20:56.279 --> 20:57.079
No one.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.519
Shlomo, to the stage.
Shlomo, to the stage now.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.240
Fuck this theater.

21:06.359 --> 21:08.279
Shlomo, to the stage!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.240
You're not going?

21:13.319 --> 21:14.759
Let them wait.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.599
Come with me.

21:28.079 --> 21:31.279
Shlomo, to the stage!

21:31.400 --> 21:33.480
I repeat, Shlomo, to the stage.

21:55.079 --> 21:56.200
Look.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.079
You see row six?
You see?

22:00.160 --> 22:02.400
The girl with the glasses.

22:03.279 --> 22:06.279
Behind her there are three men.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.680
The middle one is my son.
Watch him.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.440
I'll be right back.

22:14.559 --> 22:17.400
Oh, Monsieur!
How is your handwriting?

22:18.279 --> 22:20.119
My handwriting?
-Your handwriting. Is it clear?

22:20.200 --> 22:21.599
Unclear and ugly.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.240
A doctor then. Great!

22:23.279 --> 22:25.279
How's your mood in general?

22:25.319 --> 22:26.640
My mood?
-In general.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.640
Calm, relaxed, happy?

22:28.759 --> 22:29.519
Not calm and not happy

22:29.599 --> 22:31.599
and if you keep asking,
it'll become bad.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.640
A doctor. Great!

22:41.079 --> 22:42.240
Did he laugh?

22:43.559 --> 22:45.279
He was in stitches.
-So he laughed?

22:45.279 --> 22:49.079
I said he was in stitches.
-My son, I'm crazy about him.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.119
Such a good kid...

22:53.519 --> 22:55.119
See you.

23:07.359 --> 23:09.759
"I'm bending over.
Now what?"

23:10.039 --> 23:12.640
"Ofer?"

23:23.519 --> 23:25.279
They make you come all the way,

23:25.359 --> 23:28.119
can't they send it to me on the app?

23:28.200 --> 23:31.400
You know why they do that?
-So I won't get it, that's why.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
Exactly.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.559
When are you coming back?

23:37.079 --> 23:40.279
I'm not.
-Stop it, don't say that.

23:40.359 --> 23:43.279
Excuse me?
Forgive me for interrupting.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.759
I'm a big fan.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.480
If you're a fan,
then you're not interrupting.

23:48.519 --> 23:50.279
My name is Tomer,
I'm a director,

23:50.319 --> 23:53.599
I'm going to direct a play here soon.
-Really?

23:54.079 --> 23:55.559
Do you have a part for me?

23:56.079 --> 23:58.359
I wish, but no.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.119
It's for a young couple.

24:01.319 --> 24:02.759
A comedy.
-A comedy?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.279
You know how many comedies
we've done together?

24:05.480 --> 24:07.440
"I've been a doctor all my life,"

24:07.480 --> 24:10.480
"and still can't find where to stick an enema."

24:10.759 --> 24:12.640
"I'll show you how to aim an enema,"

24:12.759 --> 24:15.559
"And you'll show me the
caliber of the catheter."

24:15.640 --> 24:17.599
I've seen it, it's Hanoch Levin.
-"Beheading."

24:17.680 --> 24:20.119
You were in it together,
I saw it twice.

24:20.200 --> 24:23.640
Why is it about a young couple?
Make it an older couple.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.519
Rewrite it.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.759
Come on Ezra, who wants to see
an old couple making out?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.640
Everyone, what are you talking about?

24:31.680 --> 24:34.960
People want us to reminisce
about how things were.

24:35.079 --> 24:38.559
Wouldn't you want to see
Rivkaleh and I kissing

24:38.680 --> 24:41.119
and making out?
-Are you insane?

24:41.200 --> 24:42.599
Wouldn't it be nice?

24:47.240 --> 24:50.279
That good for nothing loser.
He's nothing without you.

24:50.359 --> 24:52.599
He's using your talent
to build his career.

24:53.039 --> 24:56.279
You don't need him. What, for a child?
Who needs him for a child?

24:57.039 --> 24:59.079
We can have a child together.
-You wanna have sex with me, mom?

24:59.119 --> 25:01.519
Shut up, idiot.
What, you need a man to have a baby today?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.400
We'll get sperm from a gay man
and make a kid.

25:05.680 --> 25:09.200
Idiot.
What a sourpuss.

25:10.279 --> 25:13.279
Sss...
-"Sss"? What "sss"?

25:13.359 --> 25:14.440
What's your problem?

25:15.359 --> 25:17.400
Sighing.
-I'm not sighing.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.039
Yes you are.
-Enough. Know when it's over.

25:20.079 --> 25:21.440
From our first date
you've been counting down

25:21.480 --> 25:22.599
for it to be over.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.440
Maybe it's not about ending things,

25:24.519 --> 25:26.359
but figuring them out?
-Impossible.

25:27.119 --> 25:28.279
Fine.
-Impossible.

25:28.359 --> 25:30.279
I don't want to talk to you about this.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.279
Because the truth annoys you?
-Yes, fine.

25:33.359 --> 25:35.079
Fine then, fine.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.160
Sweetheart,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.200
a husband isn't family, he's a stranger.

25:45.599 --> 25:49.079
You can see a movie with him,
laugh with him, sleep with him,

25:49.200 --> 25:51.359
but don't take him too seriously.

25:56.079 --> 25:57.400
Leave it, you're driving.

26:00.279 --> 26:01.519
Who is it?

26:04.319 --> 26:05.440
Is it Tomer?

26:06.279 --> 26:08.240
Mom.
-What do you care?

26:09.079 --> 26:10.480
Read it to me.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.039
Read me what he wrote!

26:13.079 --> 26:15.359
Stop it, you're yelling like a junkie!

26:18.119 --> 26:19.599
Mother!

26:20.279 --> 26:22.279
"Tzutz..."
What a stupid name.

26:23.720 --> 26:28.480
"I'm at the theater, I can't give up.
Come here, you won't regret it."

26:29.039 --> 26:30.240
You'll regret it.

26:30.279 --> 26:31.440
You're going?

26:33.240 --> 26:35.079
You think I'm stupid?

26:35.240 --> 26:37.720
He won't come back to you.
-Fine.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.039
You don't care about the play,
you just want him back,

26:41.079 --> 26:43.759
but he won't come back
and you'll be left crying.

26:55.559 --> 26:58.440
Hey. Thanks so much for coming.

26:58.559 --> 27:01.000
What's so urgent?
Five messages?

27:03.039 --> 27:06.400
I want to show you something.
Take a seat.

27:07.319 --> 27:09.759
What?
-Really.

27:22.960 --> 27:23.759
Go ahead.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.599
Tzutz, get me the cashews.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.200
There aren't any cashews.
I finished them yesterday.

27:49.759 --> 27:53.480
So get something else from the fridge.
-There's nothing in the fridge.

27:54.079 --> 27:58.039
Go check.
-I don't have to, I remember.

27:58.279 --> 28:00.480
From top to bottom,

28:00.599 --> 28:04.279
batteries, Bengay, ginger.

28:04.319 --> 28:07.359
Bottom shelf, butter.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.359
The one next to it is empty.
And the other one has

28:12.480 --> 28:14.480
a half bottle of Zero.

28:14.599 --> 28:18.079
Should we order in?
-Got any cash?

28:18.279 --> 28:21.680
The ATM ate my card.
-How come?

28:22.279 --> 28:23.559
Why do you think?

28:23.640 --> 28:27.359
Because I have too much money, Tzutz.

28:27.519 --> 28:33.279
I thought maybe you forgot the pin.
-I remembered the pin just fine.

28:33.359 --> 28:36.079
I forgot I had no money.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.200
So what are we eating?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.200
What do you mean?

28:41.279 --> 28:44.720
At some point we're
gonna have to get off the couch.

28:49.559 --> 28:51.400
Let's hide.
-What?

28:51.480 --> 28:56.079
Let's hide,
no one will find us here.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.319
Great idea.

28:59.599 --> 29:01.599
How long do we hide?

29:01.680 --> 29:03.359
As long as it takes.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.680
Until they find two skeletons

29:07.960 --> 29:10.720
and our headstones will say:

29:10.960 --> 29:15.279
"Died because they didn't want
to get off the couch."

29:16.359 --> 29:18.200
It's actually romantic.

29:26.759 --> 29:28.200
Bravo!

29:28.279 --> 29:31.359
Thank you. Thank you.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.279
Did we get the part?

29:34.039 --> 29:37.519
We'll let you know.
-Good luck, darling.

29:37.599 --> 29:40.519
And to you, sweetheart, congratulations.

29:42.119 --> 29:44.000
Thank you.
-Good.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.160
Come.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.400
I'm coming.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.440
That's the closest to Meryl Streep
and Dustin Hoffman I could find.

30:06.039 --> 30:07.559
How did you get them to come?

30:08.160 --> 30:11.079
I didn't know what to tell them,
so I said...

30:11.119 --> 30:13.079
I'm proposing to you.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.680
I don't get it.

30:19.079 --> 30:20.559
Are you proposing to me?

30:22.359 --> 30:23.519
What? No.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.200
No, no, no, no, no.

30:25.279 --> 30:28.359
Definitely not.
Sorry.

30:28.519 --> 30:31.519
No. What a mess. I'm sorry.

30:31.599 --> 30:34.039
I'm sorry, Tzutz, I'm sorry.

30:34.079 --> 30:37.400
Listen, I love this play.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.279
What can I say? I love it.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.079
I think it's terrific.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.599
It's a shame people won't see it

30:44.720 --> 30:47.240
just because we're... us.

30:56.759 --> 30:58.759
You're such an idiot.

31:00.079 --> 31:01.079
What?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.240
You love me, not the play.

31:15.079 --> 31:17.599
You're such an idiot, Tzutz.

31:36.359 --> 31:38.559
Well?
-What?

31:39.039 --> 31:40.039
Did she say yes?

31:42.319 --> 31:46.079
Uh... I don't know,
I think she did.

31:47.279 --> 31:48.559
Congratulations.

31:50.279 --> 31:51.480
Thanks.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.599
Yes...

32:22.720 --> 32:24.279
You didn't bring me coffee?

32:25.079 --> 32:26.319
Good morning.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.440
"One + One",
a play by Iris Shtiebel.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.240
Tzutz.
-Tzutz.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.759
Look, a place of our own.
I love it.
