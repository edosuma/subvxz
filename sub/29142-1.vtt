Love

01:10.135 --> 01:11.934
family

01:11.936 --> 01:13.639
<i>joy.</i>

01:14.873 --> 01:16.740
If you're here

01:16.742 --> 01:20.210
it's because you love
Marvin and Liza very much.

01:20.212 --> 01:21.211
At least one of 'em.

01:23.047 --> 01:25.681
<i>And you wanna share
in their happiness.</i>

01:25.683 --> 01:28.250
I know I do.

01:28.252 --> 01:31.621
Liza... Charlie, Cooper

01:31.623 --> 01:33.889
I wanna thank you for trusting
me with this ceremony.

01:33.891 --> 01:37.094
I consider it a very high honor
and a privilege

01:37.096 --> 01:39.161
and I know
your dear departed parents

01:39.163 --> 01:41.931
<i>Jerry and Barb,
would have approved.</i>

01:41.933 --> 01:44.634
And just as important,
tipped me handsomely.

01:46.305 --> 01:47.773
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:49.007 --> 01:50.006
- You alright, buddy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:50.008 --> 01:52.509
- Think unhappy thoughts.
- Okay.

01:52.511 --> 01:54.544
Childhood obesity.

01:54.546 --> 01:56.747
Dolphins caught in tuna nets.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.881
- Syria.
- Good. Hang in there, alright?

01:58.883 --> 02:01.851
Remember, 50% of marriages
end in divorce.

02:01.853 --> 02:04.286
My God, that's depressing.

02:04.288 --> 02:05.657
Thank you.

02:07.659 --> 02:09.158
What the hell?

02:09.161 --> 02:10.961
That's their brother Charlie.

02:10.963 --> 02:12.496
Apparently,
he's got some disease

02:12.498 --> 02:14.463
where he passes out
when he's happy.

02:14.465 --> 02:16.032
That's a thing?

02:16.034 --> 02:18.635
Or else he's just an asshole.

02:18.637 --> 02:20.837
<i>I... I first met Liza</i>

02:20.839 --> 02:23.439
when she was smaller
than a butternut squash.

02:24.810 --> 02:28.278
Charlie and Cooper paraded
their new baby sister into mass

02:28.280 --> 02:30.980
<i>like she was
the Second Coming herself.</i>

02:30.982 --> 02:33.450
<i>I swear they were,
they were prouder</i>

02:33.452 --> 02:35.117
even than your mom and dad.

02:35.119 --> 02:37.320
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, come on, man. Come on!

02:37.322 --> 02:39.355
- Is he okay?
- Uh, uh, Brian Wilson.

02:39.357 --> 02:41.491
- Vegan meat.
- Cosby.

02:41.493 --> 02:43.492
- Cosby.
- Cosby.

02:43.494 --> 02:45.528
Okay, let's go ahead and really
drive it to the hoop now, okay?

02:45.530 --> 02:47.330
- Okay. No, I understand. Okay.
- We're very ready.

02:47.332 --> 02:48.765
Marvin, do you take Liza
to be your wife?

02:48.767 --> 02:49.899
Faster.

02:49.901 --> 02:51.167
To have and to hold,
for better for worse

02:51.169 --> 02:53.469
sickness, health, to cherish
until death do you part?

02:53.471 --> 02:54.771
I do.

02:54.773 --> 02:56.709
<i>And, Liza,
do you do all that stuff too?</i>

03:01.078 --> 03:02.280
I do.

03:04.782 --> 03:08.284
<i>Then by the power vested..</i>

03:08.286 --> 03:11.254
<i>...in the State of New York</i>

03:11.256 --> 03:13.323
and God, I pronounce you
husband and wife.

03:13.325 --> 03:14.690
No, no, no!

03:18.697 --> 03:20.564
Okay! That's okay.
That's okay. It's alright.

03:20.566 --> 03:21.831
<i>It's alright. I got it.
Yeah, it's alright.</i>

03:24.036 --> 03:25.171
Charlie?

03:31.042 --> 03:33.745
Hey, it lives.

03:36.381 --> 03:37.948
What'd I miss?

03:37.950 --> 03:39.748
They're on their way to Belize.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.651
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

03:41.653 --> 03:43.153
<i>Check this out.</i>

03:43.155 --> 03:44.587
<i>Before they left</i>

03:44.589 --> 03:47.324
Marvin presents Liza
with this big box, right?

03:47.326 --> 03:48.758
A gift.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.893
Makes a big deal out of it.

03:50.895 --> 03:55.365
It's not jewelry,
not a day at the spa, lingerie.

03:55.367 --> 03:58.401
It's travel pants
with the zip-off legs.

03:58.403 --> 04:00.236
<i>I saw...
I saw the arm come back.</i>

04:00.238 --> 04:01.303
<i>I thought
she was gonna punch him.</i>

04:01.305 --> 04:02.738
Stop it.

04:02.740 --> 04:03.939
Seriously.

04:05.077 --> 04:06.141
No more, man.

04:06.143 --> 04:07.643
But she's alright.

04:07.645 --> 04:10.446
Uncle Jeff stitched up her lip,
and..

04:10.448 --> 04:11.748
<i>Yeah, you tore shit up, man.</i>

04:11.750 --> 04:14.316
That whole front row's
gonna have PTSD.

04:14.318 --> 04:15.485
She just looked so beautiful.

04:15.487 --> 04:17.853
I... I couldn't stop
the happiness.

04:17.856 --> 04:19.454
Yeah. You won't even consider

04:19.457 --> 04:21.589
trying that Zyrem,
Xyrem stuff again?

04:21.591 --> 04:24.060
It doesn't do any more for me
than exercise, Cooper

04:24.062 --> 04:26.563
and exercise doesn't
make me wet the bed.

04:26.565 --> 04:27.697
Alright.

04:27.699 --> 04:30.299
I just, you know..

04:30.301 --> 04:32.237
I don't want you to die.

04:33.639 --> 04:35.438
I'll be fine.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.877
As long as there are
no more weddings ever.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.844
I can count on you for that,
right?

04:40.846 --> 04:42.411
Hey.

04:42.413 --> 04:45.448
Oh, I saw, uh, Marvin's sister,
Rita, checking you out.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.017
- Was she now?
- Yeah.

04:47.019 --> 04:48.919
Must have a thing for fainters.

04:48.921 --> 04:51.453
Ah, don't be so dismissive.
Some chicks love a project.

04:51.455 --> 04:53.188
I don't wear socks
with sandals, Cooper.

04:53.190 --> 04:54.991
I have an incurable
neurologic condition.

04:54.993 --> 04:56.993
Hey, but don't be all poopy
about it.

05:18.784 --> 05:22.318
♪ The sun came up
with no conclusions ♪

05:22.320 --> 05:25.287
♪ Flowers sleeping
in their beds ♪

05:25.289 --> 05:28.325
♪ This city's cemetery's
humming ♪

05:28.327 --> 05:31.493
♪ I'm wide awake
it's morning ♪♪

06:04.829 --> 06:06.332
Okay, come on.

06:10.569 --> 06:12.469
Let me help. I'll help you.

06:12.471 --> 06:14.703
Thank you so much.

06:14.705 --> 06:16.007
No problem.

06:38.062 --> 06:40.397
<i>Your baby sister married off.</i>

06:40.399 --> 06:42.698
- Mm-hmm.
- That gotta make you feel old.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.400
Liza always did
everything first.

06:44.402 --> 06:45.635
When she was 12 years old

06:45.637 --> 06:47.503
she pressured me
into smoking a joint.

06:47.505 --> 06:50.272
Come on, man.
Don't you wanna fall in love?

06:50.274 --> 06:52.241
Oh, I wanna be in love, sure.

06:52.243 --> 06:54.911
I... Ideally, I'd like
to skip past the honeymoon phase

06:54.913 --> 06:57.781
to the steady
sharing deodorant phase.

06:57.783 --> 07:00.750
- Oh, you're killin' me, man.
- I'm with you, Charlie.

07:00.752 --> 07:02.217
It's important to find someone

07:02.219 --> 07:03.753
that you can kind of forget
is there

07:03.755 --> 07:06.322
so that when they leave,
it's like losing a cat.

07:06.324 --> 07:08.224
No, that... that's not
exactly what I..

07:08.226 --> 07:09.859
You know,
I... I need to be careful.

07:09.861 --> 07:11.960
I need someone
I can picture in sweatpants

07:11.962 --> 07:13.630
just the right amount of mousy.

07:13.632 --> 07:16.765
Do you listen
to the Modern Love podcast?

07:16.767 --> 07:19.335
- I don't. You do?
- Religiously.

07:19.337 --> 07:21.570
There was a story the other day
about a couple

07:21.572 --> 07:23.505
where he was deaf
and she was blind

07:23.507 --> 07:26.075
so they couldn't speak
or use sign language

07:26.077 --> 07:28.411
but they were happily married
for, like, 15 years.

07:28.413 --> 07:31.448
- Mm-hmm. What happened then?
- Oh.

07:31.450 --> 07:34.017
She was killed
by a self-driving car.

07:34.019 --> 07:37.286
- Yeah. It was a lot.
- Thanks for your input, Victor.

07:37.288 --> 07:40.423
Everyone stop talking right now.
I need to concentrate.

07:40.425 --> 07:42.224
You don't have to react
that way to stuff.

07:42.226 --> 07:43.359
Like with my mom
with the baseball..

07:43.361 --> 07:44.661
I took you
to the baseball game.

07:44.663 --> 07:47.130
You were like a crazy person
at the baseball game.

07:47.132 --> 07:49.666
A crazy person at a ba..
It's a baseball game.

07:49.668 --> 07:51.433
Is there etiquette
for a baseball game?

07:51.435 --> 07:53.335
It's a Little League game
with kids. Alright?

07:53.337 --> 07:54.871
Okay, fine.
So how about you getting drunk

07:54.873 --> 07:56.138
at a Little League game?

07:56.140 --> 07:58.474
Well, what else are you gonna do
at a Little League game?

07:58.476 --> 08:00.510
I want you to sit down
for a second.

08:12.123 --> 08:14.791
I ask you to..
I ask you to relax.

08:14.793 --> 08:16.592
I say, "Relax,"
and you take it...

08:16.594 --> 08:20.162
It is the most annoying thing
on the planet to hear.

08:20.164 --> 08:22.498
I'm just saying relax,
like it's not that big...

08:22.500 --> 08:25.734
- Stop saying that.
- Will you just relax?

08:25.736 --> 08:27.402
What are they talking about?

08:27.404 --> 08:30.940
You know I've been doing a lot
of work on myself lately.

08:30.942 --> 08:33.909
Like, I've really been trying
to become a better person.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.846
Are you breaking up with me?

08:36.847 --> 08:38.948
- Yes.
- Seriously?

08:38.950 --> 08:40.784
- Shh.
- Shh.

08:40.785 --> 08:43.054
We're in a library.

08:45.123 --> 08:48.824
Is that why you brought me here?
So I wouldn't raise my voice?

08:48.826 --> 08:50.959
- <i>Shh.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

08:50.961 --> 08:53.730
Listen,
we both know that you're passionate.

08:53.732 --> 08:55.564
Oh, is that a euphemism
for loud?

08:55.566 --> 08:57.132
- <i>Shh.</i>
- It's gettin' heated.

08:57.134 --> 08:58.934
Euphemism's a great word.

08:58.936 --> 09:01.571
Here's another one.
You're freakin' bananas.

09:01.573 --> 09:04.039
- Motherfuck!
- Ow! Alright.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.976
- Great.
- Are you serious right now?

09:06.978 --> 09:09.044
- Ugh! Take that!
- Okay, ma'am, would you mind?

09:09.046 --> 09:11.481
- Miss?
- Will you, please, get down?

09:11.483 --> 09:13.917
- I like it up here.
- Yeah, she's crazy, man.

09:13.919 --> 09:16.052
And not just like part of the
month, like the whole thing.

09:16.054 --> 09:19.856
Oh, my God! This penny loafer
wearing asshole

09:19.858 --> 09:21.558
brought me in here
to break up with me.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.659
Yeah, 'cause I thought
she'd keep a lid on it for once.

09:23.661 --> 09:25.595
- Ugh!
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

09:25.597 --> 09:29.031
- Why don't you just let it out?
- What?

09:29.033 --> 09:30.399
You're standing on a table

09:30.401 --> 09:31.668
you clearly
have something to say.

09:31.670 --> 09:34.236
I think you should say it.

09:34.238 --> 09:37.640
Okay, well, for example,
"Keep a lid on it."

09:37.642 --> 09:39.675
I don't have to keep a lid
on anything.

09:39.677 --> 09:42.544
I'm pretty sure every nerd
in this library disagrees.

09:42.546 --> 09:43.746
<i>You know what's crazy is</i>

09:43.748 --> 09:46.082
I don't even know
how we ended up together.

09:46.084 --> 09:49.751
He's... he's rude to waiters.
He screens calls from his mom.

09:49.753 --> 09:52.755
- He threads his eyebrows.
- I'm part Greek.

09:52.757 --> 09:53.823
And your friends don't like him?

09:53.825 --> 09:55.524
Oh, they hate him.

09:55.526 --> 09:57.492
And they can't understand
what I see in him, you know.

09:57.494 --> 09:59.895
And then after a while

09:59.897 --> 10:01.997
it becomes the reason
why I'm with him.

10:01.999 --> 10:05.434
Sure. It's bad choices.
That's your thing, right?

10:05.436 --> 10:08.103
- Yeah. So it's her fault.
- Hey, hey.

10:08.105 --> 10:10.305
Miss, please,
give Lavelle the book.

10:10.307 --> 10:12.408
You stand back
or I'm gonna tear this apart.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.343
She's all talk.

10:14.345 --> 10:15.645
Ma'am?

10:15.647 --> 10:18.014
- Ma'am?
- Ugh!

10:18.016 --> 10:19.548
Ma'am!

10:19.550 --> 10:22.217
You will never ever tear
the binding on that book.

10:22.219 --> 10:25.154
It's reinforced for libraries.

10:25.156 --> 10:27.323
You can, however, try the pages.

10:27.325 --> 10:28.457
- Charlie?
- No, no, please.

10:28.459 --> 10:30.092
Start in the middle.
Knock yourself out.

10:30.094 --> 10:31.627
- Okay. Yeah!
- There you go!

10:31.629 --> 10:33.228
See how good that feels?

10:33.230 --> 10:34.797
- Ooh!
- Does that feel good?

10:34.799 --> 10:37.366
- Huh? Am I being loud now?
- Just relax.

10:37.368 --> 10:39.269
Oh, relax?

10:39.271 --> 10:40.470
<i>Relax?</i>

10:40.472 --> 10:42.605
Re.. Re..

10:42.607 --> 10:44.009
Relax!

10:47.512 --> 10:49.345
- Ooh!
- <i>Tell me something.</i>

10:50.916 --> 10:54.250
Did you ever really think
that this would last?

10:54.252 --> 10:56.752
<i>Or, uh, the better question is</i>

10:56.754 --> 10:58.954
did you ever really want it to?

11:07.998 --> 11:09.667
Fine, we can break up.

11:11.969 --> 11:13.973
Well, that went as expected.

11:16.074 --> 11:17.906
- Thanks.
- <i>How'd he do that?</i>

11:17.908 --> 11:20.076
Like a blind man
learns to listen

11:20.078 --> 11:22.047
except Charlie's got an ear
for pain.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.582
- What's it to you?
- What?

11:26.584 --> 11:28.384
Uh, I'm... I'm just..

11:28.386 --> 11:30.986
I'm trying to keep things
calm here.

11:30.988 --> 11:32.925
- You're good at it.
- I need to be.

11:34.792 --> 11:37.095
- Sorry!
- Don't do that anymore.

11:41.498 --> 11:42.966
I'm taking off early.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.968
Measles outbreak on the rise.
CDC concerned.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.202
Thank you.

12:03.688 --> 12:05.321
Zika virus.

12:05.323 --> 12:07.222
Congress.

12:07.224 --> 12:08.658
Oh, God.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.459
Famine in Darfur.

12:10.461 --> 12:11.861
White guy, dreadlocks.

12:11.863 --> 12:13.496
Oh!

12:13.498 --> 12:14.896
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

12:14.898 --> 12:17.632
- You just made it.
- Barely.

12:17.634 --> 12:18.836
Thanks.

12:24.709 --> 12:27.043
- <i>You good?</i>
- Yeah.

13:02.613 --> 13:05.715
There's someone here to see you.
She brought you something.

13:05.717 --> 13:06.852
She?

13:08.619 --> 13:10.520
Oh, God. Tell her I died.

13:10.522 --> 13:12.221
I already told her
you were here.

13:12.223 --> 13:13.755
- It was a very sudden...
- Hello?

13:13.757 --> 13:15.191
Hi there, Mr. Librarian.

13:15.193 --> 13:17.129
Hey. Come to throw
more books around?

13:18.595 --> 13:22.298
I'm here to thank you for coming
to my defense the other day.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.765
Oh, I... I didn't come
to your defense.

13:23.767 --> 13:26.034
I... I just came to get you
off the table.

13:26.036 --> 13:27.837
Well, still, I appreciate it.

13:27.839 --> 13:30.472
I, uh, I got you this.
A replacement.

13:30.474 --> 13:33.308
- Didn't have to do that.
- It's the least I could do.

13:33.310 --> 13:34.976
No, the copy you destroyed
was a first edition.

13:34.978 --> 13:36.111
Oh.

13:36.113 --> 13:38.014
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.548
Well, you did kind of
egg me on though.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.320
Oh.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.689
Alright.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.189
I was thinking about something
you said that day.

13:47.191 --> 13:48.390
Right.

13:48.392 --> 13:49.792
Uh, did I really
want it to last

13:49.794 --> 13:51.026
and I realized that I didn't.

13:51.028 --> 13:52.395
It's a good thing it ended then.

13:52.397 --> 13:54.163
Yeah, but why did I
get into a relationship

13:54.165 --> 13:55.331
I knew was doomed to fail?

13:55.333 --> 13:56.933
Ask the guy who doomed it.

13:56.935 --> 13:58.333
It's not his fault.

13:58.335 --> 14:01.303
Actually, it is all his fault.

14:01.305 --> 14:02.605
But I knew where it was headed

14:02.607 --> 14:05.173
when he canceled on a date
to go to a boat show.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.043
By the way, he's the second guy
to do that to me.

14:07.045 --> 14:08.914
Maybe you should move inland?

14:10.248 --> 14:12.180
There's something
I find irresistible about men

14:12.182 --> 14:13.249
I have no future with.

14:15.887 --> 14:16.952
Oh.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.524
Right.

14:22.526 --> 14:24.393
It's so quiet in here.

14:24.395 --> 14:25.394
Does it make you
just wanna scream?

14:25.396 --> 14:26.529
Don't scream, please.

14:27.665 --> 14:29.499
Come on, have you tried
screaming? It's fun.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.867
I know it's fun, but there's
more to life than fun, you know.

14:31.869 --> 14:34.472
- Is there?
- I'm not sure anymore.

14:40.277 --> 14:42.678
Well, uh, thanks again.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.050
- I'm Francesca, by the way.
- I'm Charlie.

14:51.522 --> 14:54.390
Well, um, it was nice
to meet you, too, Charlie.

14:54.392 --> 14:56.027
Yeah. Uh..

14:57.060 --> 14:58.296
Yeah.

15:00.098 --> 15:02.999
We need to settle something
right now.

15:03.001 --> 15:04.366
Are you gay?

15:04.368 --> 15:07.436
I mean, it's... it's cool
if you are, but I gotta know

15:07.438 --> 15:09.938
'cause I want off
this emotional rollercoaster.

15:09.940 --> 15:12.241
I'm not gay, Lavelle.

15:12.243 --> 15:14.076
Eunuch? Are you a eunuch?

15:14.078 --> 15:15.477
- What?
- It is unfair.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.513
You won't go out with her
because of how she looks.

15:17.515 --> 15:19.215
It's not her fault
that she's smoking hot.

15:19.217 --> 15:21.016
No, it's not just her looks.
It's her manner.

15:21.018 --> 15:23.619
It's her laugh. It's her
stupid gift-wrapped books.

15:23.621 --> 15:26.154
She's just too..

15:26.156 --> 15:27.923
Too.

15:27.925 --> 15:29.759
It sounds like
you kind of dig her.

15:29.761 --> 15:30.959
That's the problem.

15:30.961 --> 15:32.962
<i>Let's get down to brass tacks,
Charlie.</i>

15:32.964 --> 15:36.131
Sperm quality declines sharply
after age 35.

15:36.133 --> 15:38.000
Thank you, Victor.

15:38.002 --> 15:40.602
You gotta stick your neck out
sometime, Charlie.

15:40.604 --> 15:43.207
- Life will pass you right by.
- Yeah, right.

15:48.979 --> 15:50.114
Okay!

15:52.450 --> 15:53.982
Okay, what?

15:53.984 --> 15:56.954
Okay, I'll go out with you.

15:58.388 --> 16:01.856
Oh, I, I didn't exactly ask.

16:01.858 --> 16:04.659
Uh, how does
2 o'clock Saturday sound?

16:04.661 --> 16:07.730
- Will your mom be driving?
- My parents are dead.

16:07.732 --> 16:08.867
Oh.

16:11.536 --> 16:14.370
Okay then.
Saturday at 2:00.

16:14.372 --> 16:16.404
- I'll wear sunscreen.
- Great.

16:16.406 --> 16:19.308
I mean, good.
S... see you then.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.143
Oh, wait. Charlie,
don't you need my number?

16:21.145 --> 16:24.583
Call the front desk later.
I need to go right now.

16:29.820 --> 16:32.321
I don't know.
I guess I just don't get it.

16:32.323 --> 16:35.024
You haven't gone on a date
in years, right?

16:35.026 --> 16:37.963
- So why her? Why now?
- I don't know.

16:39.229 --> 16:40.730
She was so angry.

16:40.732 --> 16:43.131
Beside herself.
Completely out of control.

16:43.133 --> 16:46.334
- It was thrilling.
- Uff. I don't get that at all.

16:46.336 --> 16:48.537
It's like she's everything
I've ever avoided.

16:48.539 --> 16:51.810
- I'm drawn to her like a moth.
- To a flame.

16:53.844 --> 16:56.345
Charlie, the end of that phrase
is to a burning, deadly flame.

16:56.347 --> 16:57.783
Yeah, I... I get it.

16:58.950 --> 17:00.515
What is there to decide?

17:00.517 --> 17:03.084
All your shirts look the same.

17:03.086 --> 17:05.320
Why do all your shirts
look the same?

17:05.323 --> 17:06.592
No compliments.

17:08.226 --> 17:10.892
Does she know?
Does Francesca...

17:10.894 --> 17:12.560
Are you kidding?
Hi, I'm Charlie.

17:12.563 --> 17:13.963
I'm medically forbidden
to have fun.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.630
You wanna go out?

17:15.632 --> 17:17.365
Pass the tacks.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.633
No.

17:18.635 --> 17:20.769
Come on, Charlie.
It's too gruesome.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.737
It works.

17:22.739 --> 17:24.442
Fine.

17:25.575 --> 17:27.575
Listen, you put
as many office supplies

17:27.577 --> 17:29.111
in the bottom of your shoe
as you want.

17:29.113 --> 17:32.113
Eventually,
she's gonna find out.

17:32.115 --> 17:34.051
Dates are supposed to be fun.

17:35.819 --> 17:37.421
Not this one.

17:39.457 --> 17:42.591
The only good thing to come
of my grandmother's Alzheimer's

17:42.593 --> 17:46.565
was that it helped her forget
her miserable life.

17:47.931 --> 17:51.766
She was raised in a Hooverville

17:51.768 --> 17:54.637
on the wrong side
of the wrong side of the tracks.

17:54.639 --> 17:57.073
The kind of place
where dreams go to die

17:57.075 --> 18:01.476
and hope,
hope is smothered

18:01.478 --> 18:03.446
in its crib.

18:03.448 --> 18:04.714
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.749
See Mildred Munch
didn't have hope.

18:07.751 --> 18:10.186
She didn't have dreams

18:10.188 --> 18:13.825
so she didn't have
nothing to lose.

18:18.095 --> 18:21.030
Norman, you son of a bitch.
You get a job.

18:21.032 --> 18:24.367
You get a job
or you're gonna get a new wife.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.669
Those are empty threats, just
like you're an empty person..

18:27.671 --> 18:29.804
Were there good reviews?

18:29.806 --> 18:30.973
I didn't check.

18:30.975 --> 18:32.707
You're not a man,
you're a hulk.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.111
No, please, I..

18:36.146 --> 18:37.580
Why not?

18:37.582 --> 18:40.783
<i>And that, dear friends,
is when Mildred Munch</i>

18:40.785 --> 18:44.690
my Bubbie Millie turned..

18:45.690 --> 18:47.555
...to prostitution.

18:50.862 --> 18:52.695
Hand jobs!

18:52.697 --> 18:54.662
Seriously, why are we here?

18:54.664 --> 18:56.297
- Hand jobs! First one's free!
- Huh?

18:56.299 --> 18:58.167
Why are we here?

18:58.169 --> 18:59.802
- <i>Shh.</i>
- I'm sorry.

18:59.804 --> 19:02.772
Is my play interrupting
your conversation?

19:02.774 --> 19:04.140
No.

19:04.142 --> 19:06.574
'Cause I didn't buy a ticket
to your conversation.

19:06.576 --> 19:08.677
- So sorry. We, we're done.
- Yeah.

19:08.679 --> 19:10.579
- We're.. Uh, please, continue.
- Sorry.

19:10.581 --> 19:13.248
Thank you for permission
to continue my play, sir.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.251
I very much appreciate it.

19:15.253 --> 19:17.119
I'll just hop back
into the moment..

19:17.121 --> 19:19.021
We should go. I'm sorry.

19:19.023 --> 19:20.322
...I'll just pretend
that I'm not

19:20.324 --> 19:21.457
completely distracted right now.

19:21.459 --> 19:22.457
I'm sorry.

19:22.459 --> 19:23.825
How about I skip
to the part where

19:23.827 --> 19:26.762
uh, her first-born dies
of common diarrhea?

19:26.764 --> 19:28.367
I said diarrhea!

19:30.634 --> 19:34.004
I said diarrhea.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.774
- Diarrhea!
- Alright. Yeah.

19:38.776 --> 19:39.941
I... I know.

19:39.943 --> 19:42.044
I know, but to be fair to him

19:42.046 --> 19:43.711
we did kind of...

19:43.713 --> 19:46.282
- Diarrhea?
- Yeah, diarrhea.

19:46.284 --> 19:48.453
Look, I kind of feel for him.

19:50.086 --> 19:52.822
- Where are we?
- Uh, it's, uh..

19:52.824 --> 19:54.989
Are we, are we in danger?

19:54.991 --> 19:57.192
Oh, it's starting to feel
that way, yeah.

19:57.194 --> 19:59.495
Hold onto me,
so you don't get kidnapped.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.634
So tell me about your sick aunt.

20:06.636 --> 20:08.970
Wow, you flirt weird.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.873
Sorry.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.677
It seemed important. It's
something you're going through.

20:14.679 --> 20:16.911
Yeah, sometimes it's nice
not to be going through it.

20:16.913 --> 20:18.447
Yeah, of course, it is,
but I'm an idiot

20:18.449 --> 20:20.384
so just ignore me.
You'll have way more fun.

20:21.419 --> 20:22.517
It's alright.

20:22.519 --> 20:24.455
Since we're on the subject..

20:25.456 --> 20:27.656
...it is hard.

20:27.658 --> 20:28.858
She's like my second mother

20:28.860 --> 20:31.826
after my real mother died
of the same thing.

20:31.828 --> 20:34.095
Breast cancer runs in my family
like hammertoes.

20:34.097 --> 20:37.168
So... I've got that
to look forward to.

20:38.401 --> 20:40.736
Look who's being fun now.

20:40.738 --> 20:43.374
I'm sorry, Francesca.
That's awful.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.010
Thank you.

20:48.211 --> 20:50.478
It's not all bad. I've gotten
really close with Sylvia

20:50.480 --> 20:52.448
since I've been living with her

20:52.450 --> 20:54.550
which I guess means
it's gonna hurt

20:54.552 --> 20:56.755
that much more when she, um..

20:58.855 --> 21:01.323
Well, that will burn New York
for me.

21:01.325 --> 21:02.957
Are you gonna leave?

21:02.959 --> 21:05.363
Oh, yeah. But I always do.

21:08.598 --> 21:11.900
I lost somebody close to me
when I was young.

21:11.902 --> 21:15.437
My Grandpa Jacob, he was like
my best friend growing up.

21:15.439 --> 21:19.475
We had the same, uh..
We had a lot in common.

21:19.477 --> 21:21.709
Every Sunday, he'd take me out
to the carousel

21:21.711 --> 21:24.880
let me go round and round
as many times as I wanted

21:24.882 --> 21:28.149
even after he had to stop,
you know.

21:28.151 --> 21:30.622
I think that's the happiest
that I've ever been.

21:33.457 --> 21:35.093
Are you happy now?

21:37.961 --> 21:40.696
Not as happy as Mildred Munch.

21:40.698 --> 21:41.999
Diarrhea.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.167
- Common diarrhea.
- Common.

21:45.169 --> 21:47.669
- Not even special diarrhea.
- Nope, common.

21:47.671 --> 21:49.705
- You didn't have one.
- Exactly.

21:49.707 --> 21:50.906
On the wrong side
of the wrong side of the tracks.

21:50.908 --> 21:53.309
The wrong side of the wrong side
of the tracks.

21:53.311 --> 21:54.610
Like Troy McClure.

21:54.612 --> 21:56.477
I can't believe
you took me to that play.

21:56.479 --> 21:57.646
Nor can I.

21:57.648 --> 21:59.547
This is me.

21:59.549 --> 22:01.316
So, uh, my aunt
should still be at karate

22:01.318 --> 22:03.485
if you wanna come up
for a drink.

22:03.487 --> 22:05.588
A drink? It's 3:30.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.023
Yes, it is.

22:08.025 --> 22:09.960
It's not about the drink,
Charlie.

22:17.701 --> 22:19.435
Sure, why not?

22:19.437 --> 22:21.102
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:21.104 --> 22:23.805
You know, I see now
why you insisted on a matinee.

22:23.807 --> 22:25.841
We have more energy
for messin' around.

22:31.282 --> 22:32.715
Char... Charlie?

22:32.717 --> 22:35.117
Oh, my God. Charlie!

22:35.119 --> 22:37.352
Charlie!

22:53.437 --> 22:54.805
Oh, come on.

22:56.507 --> 22:58.506
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.</i>

22:58.508 --> 23:00.441
Uh, I'm looking
for, uh, Charles Greene.

23:00.443 --> 23:02.544
Are you here for Charlie?

23:02.546 --> 23:04.045
I'm Francesca.

23:04.047 --> 23:06.681
Oh, Jesus. No wonder.

23:06.683 --> 23:08.082
Sorry.

23:08.084 --> 23:10.419
Hi. Cooper, brother.

23:10.421 --> 23:12.454
Oh.

23:12.456 --> 23:13.656
So how'd it go?

23:13.658 --> 23:16.091
What do you mean?
We ended up here.

23:16.093 --> 23:17.659
Right.
Have you heard anything?

23:17.661 --> 23:19.294
Uh, just that
he didn't break his neck

23:19.296 --> 23:20.629
which I guess is good.

23:20.631 --> 23:23.631
Yeah. I guess you two
really hit it off, huh?

23:23.633 --> 23:25.801
Well, yeah. I mean, I think..
I thought so.

23:25.803 --> 23:27.769
I... I don't know.

23:27.771 --> 23:31.707
I mean, we were headed upstairs
and he just dropped.

23:31.709 --> 23:34.976
He, like, I think he fainted
from the heat or something?

23:34.978 --> 23:37.545
Yeah. Yep. From the heat.
Yeah, probably.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.380
You know, that's super common
because you gotta...

23:39.382 --> 23:41.216
Well, good news.

23:41.218 --> 23:43.185
Charlie's got
a pretty nasty cut

23:43.187 --> 23:44.687
and his head's gonna ache
for a while

23:44.689 --> 23:46.755
but there's no fractures,
so all in all

23:46.757 --> 23:48.424
we feel he got off lucky
this time.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.159
- This time?
- Yeah...

23:50.161 --> 23:53.562
You know what,
Charlie's, uh, got a thing.

23:53.564 --> 23:56.765
And it's a condition,
according to some

23:56.767 --> 23:58.600
but to others,
it's an adorable quirk.

23:58.602 --> 24:00.502
It's a disease likely caused

24:00.504 --> 24:02.603
by the shortage of hypocretin
in his brain.

24:02.605 --> 24:05.407
It's a chemical signal that
makes most of us stay awake.

24:05.409 --> 24:07.909
Essentially,
Charlie's body gets tricked

24:07.911 --> 24:10.746
to think that it's asleep.

24:10.748 --> 24:12.851
Well, adorable quirk.

24:14.151 --> 24:15.519
Disease.

24:21.691 --> 24:23.027
Hey.

24:24.495 --> 24:25.764
Oh, hi.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.400
So, that was crazy.

24:32.402 --> 24:34.836
I guess I must have fainted.
I need to hydrate.

24:34.838 --> 24:36.774
Charlie, I know.

24:44.681 --> 24:46.017
What's it called?

24:48.952 --> 24:51.320
Cataplexy.

24:51.322 --> 24:53.691
Technically,
narcolepsy with cataplexy.

24:55.492 --> 24:57.027
Runs in the family.

24:58.362 --> 25:00.394
Your Grampa Jacob?

25:00.396 --> 25:02.230
Yeah.

25:02.232 --> 25:03.931
Yeah.

25:03.933 --> 25:06.034
Growing up, I... I thought
he slept all the time

25:06.036 --> 25:07.902
'cause he was old

25:07.904 --> 25:10.872
and then it started
happening to me.

25:10.874 --> 25:14.612
<i>Pretty much any strong emotion
will trigger it.</i>

25:15.813 --> 25:17.582
In my case, it's..

25:19.682 --> 25:21.685
...it's mainly when I'm happy.

25:23.053 --> 25:24.456
<i>So thank you.</i>

25:28.325 --> 25:30.993
Why didn't you tell me?

25:30.995 --> 25:35.197
Uh, well, I had a girlfriend
in college

25:35.199 --> 25:38.036
Alice, and, uh, she knew.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.106
But she didn't really know,
you know.

25:44.642 --> 25:46.941
And because she was my first

25:46.943 --> 25:48.576
I didn't know
what would actually happen

25:48.578 --> 25:51.315
when we finally, um..

25:52.882 --> 25:54.949
Oh, when you..

25:54.951 --> 25:57.753
Oh! Oh, wow!

25:57.755 --> 25:59.254
That's, it's not funny.

25:59.256 --> 26:00.721
Oh, come on,
it's a little bit funny.

26:00.723 --> 26:02.490
- It's not at all..
- I mean, what..

26:02.492 --> 26:04.426
Not in the least bit funny.

26:04.428 --> 26:06.829
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus Christ.

26:06.831 --> 26:09.267
Okay. You're right.
It is not funny.

26:11.869 --> 26:15.336
You know,
I came to naked on my back..

26:15.338 --> 26:19.740
...surrounded by EMTs,
the RA, half the dorm.

26:19.742 --> 26:21.879
- Alice thought I'd died.
- Oh.

26:23.581 --> 26:27.983
I mostly steered clear
of girlfriends since then.

26:27.985 --> 26:29.921
I... I can't afford
the insurance.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.794
Today was a really big deal
for you, wasn't it?

26:39.462 --> 26:41.565
It was a really big deal
for me too.

26:43.433 --> 26:46.237
Remember I never date guys
I think I have a future with?

26:50.440 --> 26:52.807
Let's quit while we're ahead.

26:52.809 --> 26:55.177
I took a risk.
It was obviously a bad idea.

26:55.179 --> 26:56.745
Oh, hey, don't worry about it.

26:56.747 --> 26:59.480
We'll just take it slow.
We'll stick to really boring...

26:59.482 --> 27:00.549
It's not gonna work.

27:00.551 --> 27:02.383
Wait, like, um,
the botanical gardens...

27:02.385 --> 27:04.820
It's not gonna work.
It's not that simple.

27:04.822 --> 27:07.421
Symposiums, lectures,
Roosevelt Island...

27:07.423 --> 27:10.027
Please... stop.

27:11.728 --> 27:13.864
- I need to check you again.
- Sure.

27:15.665 --> 27:17.632
Look, I had a really good time
with you.

27:17.634 --> 27:19.671
I just wanna remember it
that way.

27:21.138 --> 27:23.208
Alright.
Look at me, please.

27:24.909 --> 27:27.743
<i>Pain, scale of one to ten,
ten is highest?</i>

27:27.745 --> 27:29.076
Uh, two.

27:29.078 --> 27:32.380
- <i>Alright. Any chills?</i>
- Um, no.

27:32.382 --> 27:34.349
- <i>Dizziness?</i>
- No.

27:34.351 --> 27:37.119
- <i>No? Headache?</i>
- Not anymore.

27:48.132 --> 27:51.033
<i>"'How about his old bunny?'
the boy's governess asked.</i>

27:51.035 --> 27:53.368
"'That, ' said the doctor.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.803
"'Why, it's a mass
of scarlet fever germs.

27:55.805 --> 27:57.605
"Burn it at once!'

27:57.607 --> 28:00.309
"And so the little rabbit
was put into a sack

28:00.311 --> 28:02.811
"with the old picture books
and a lot of rubbish

28:02.813 --> 28:06.247
"and carried out
to the end of the garden.

28:06.249 --> 28:10.252
That was a fine place
to have a bonfire."

28:10.254 --> 28:13.054
This story is sad.
Read something funny.

28:13.056 --> 28:14.790
- Yeah, funny.
- Yeah, funny.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.490
Look, this story is actually
about something.

28:16.492 --> 28:18.726
- Funny!
- Boo!

28:18.728 --> 28:21.530
- Really?
- <i>Throw it in the bonfire.</i>

28:21.532 --> 28:24.632
Alright.
I'll try this little baby here.

28:24.634 --> 28:29.204
This one is called
"Where Did My Sweet Grandma Go?"

28:29.206 --> 28:32.940
Okay. Alright, alright!
Time for a potty break, gang.

28:32.942 --> 28:34.409
Yeah, you know
what's goin' on.

28:34.411 --> 28:36.344
When we come back,
maybe Mr. Charlie will read

28:36.346 --> 28:37.813
"Walter The Farting Dog," huh?

28:37.815 --> 28:39.214
- Yeah!
- <i>Yeah!</i>

28:39.216 --> 28:40.748
- Farts! Farts! Farts!
- Farts! Farts! Farts!

28:40.750 --> 28:42.249
For your information

28:42.251 --> 28:44.553
Walter farts because
he's been fed human food.

28:44.555 --> 28:47.089
- It's actually very sad.
- This field trip sucks.

28:47.091 --> 28:50.024
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Not nice, Deangelo. Okay?

28:50.026 --> 28:52.928
Mr. Charlie's
havin' a grumpy day.

28:52.930 --> 28:54.830
Ignore him, Charlie.
His dads are gettin' a divorce.

28:54.832 --> 28:57.365
Hmm. Oh, my God.

28:57.367 --> 28:59.503
- <i>Oh, what is she doing here?</i>
- Nothing good.

29:01.238 --> 29:02.806
- What's up?
- Hey.

29:05.275 --> 29:06.611
Cool.

29:08.545 --> 29:10.014
How you doin', Charlie?

29:11.547 --> 29:14.349
- Uh..
- I... I feel terrible.

29:14.351 --> 29:15.950
You had a nice,
depressing date planned

29:15.952 --> 29:18.553
and I ruined it and made you
crack your head open.

29:18.555 --> 29:22.125
- I think you should go.
- Wait. Is everything okay?

29:24.260 --> 29:26.194
I don't know how to answer that.

29:26.196 --> 29:27.661
You're back at work.

29:27.663 --> 29:29.730
Fine,
then everything's stupendous.

29:29.732 --> 29:32.034
Look, I know,
you wanted to take things slow

29:32.036 --> 29:33.601
and I messed it up.

29:33.603 --> 29:35.137
I... I just..

29:35.139 --> 29:38.372
I think
I... I tried to get physical

29:38.374 --> 29:39.608
because I was trying to escape

29:39.610 --> 29:41.275
the emotional connection
we were having and...

29:41.277 --> 29:42.643
Fran, stop it, please?

29:42.645 --> 29:44.246
I don't wanna do this.
I can't do it.

29:44.248 --> 29:46.180
If you're looking
for a boyfriend, I'm not him.

29:46.182 --> 29:47.282
Oh, come on, Charlie,
I'm just trying to figure out

29:47.284 --> 29:48.582
why I do this thing.

29:48.584 --> 29:49.851
You wanna have fun?
You want to escape?

29:49.853 --> 29:52.023
- Look, meet my brother.
- Wait, what?

29:53.723 --> 29:55.424
I... I don't want
another relationship, Charlie.

29:55.426 --> 29:57.292
That's fine.
You won't get one.

29:57.294 --> 29:59.561
I guarantee within six weeks,
he is out of there.

29:59.563 --> 30:01.662
Six weeks is forty two days.

30:01.664 --> 30:04.167
Yes, awesome multiplication,
Frederick.

30:05.199 --> 30:05.801
You believe this kid?
Five years old.

30:05.803 --> 30:07.669
He's a hot male
kindergarten teacher.

30:07.671 --> 30:10.304
Look at that jawline.
Snap him up.

30:10.306 --> 30:12.407
Hey, Cooper, do me a favor.

30:12.409 --> 30:15.110
Take this lovely lady
out for a coffee.

30:15.112 --> 30:17.344
Tell her about the time you went
skydiving with Liza Minnelli.

30:17.346 --> 30:19.180
Correction,
it was a small Asian man

30:19.182 --> 30:20.582
who looked like Liza Minnelli.

30:20.584 --> 30:22.918
I'm so confused,
and frankly a little offended.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.187
I don't wanna get coffee
with your brother. No offense.

30:25.189 --> 30:27.389
Then go for tea or popsicles

30:27.391 --> 30:28.957
or don't go at all.
I don't care.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.161
Just, please, leave me alone.

30:38.134 --> 30:40.171
- Jeff Cho.
- What?

30:41.438 --> 30:43.772
His name was Jeff Cho.

30:45.308 --> 30:47.109
<i>Oh, man,
that was such a mistake.</i>

30:47.111 --> 30:48.743
What was I hopin' to hear?

30:48.745 --> 30:51.012
"Oh, you tried to kill me,
but that's alright. We're cool."

30:51.014 --> 30:53.148
Look, I know you feel bad.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.484
Take it from me.
Charlie's gonna be fine.

30:55.486 --> 30:57.552
He's used to this.
I've seen that guy pass out

30:57.554 --> 31:00.221
after he caught a fish, okay?

31:00.223 --> 31:01.922
One time he found a prize
at the bottom of a box

31:01.924 --> 31:03.691
of Corn Pops. Gone.

31:03.693 --> 31:06.628
Every time the Jets win,
which luckily is very rare...

31:06.630 --> 31:09.497
Oh, phew. For a second there,
I thought I was special.

31:09.499 --> 31:11.399
Oh, you know what I mean.
Come on.

31:11.401 --> 31:14.034
I do, and I am very comforted
by your insults.

31:14.036 --> 31:16.138
- Great.
- Thanks, Cooper.

31:16.140 --> 31:18.005
Is that a family name?
I've never heard that before.

31:18.007 --> 31:20.175
- Named after the dog.
- That's not true.

31:20.177 --> 31:22.511
It is true. 100%.

31:22.513 --> 31:23.844
Yeah, it was a Saint Bernard.

31:23.846 --> 31:25.213
He died
just before I was born

31:25.215 --> 31:27.849
and Charlie started
callin' me Cooper.

31:27.851 --> 31:29.383
I guess I was a hairy baby.

31:33.222 --> 31:35.258
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

31:36.994 --> 31:38.262
See you around.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.662
Hey, where are you headed?

31:41.664 --> 31:43.532
- Uh, Cobble Hill.
- That's great.

31:43.534 --> 31:45.766
That's right on our way.
We'll give you a ride.

31:45.768 --> 31:47.369
- Okay.
- Just a heads up.

31:47.371 --> 31:49.170
The ride's
a big yellow school bus.

31:49.172 --> 31:50.240
Oh.

31:51.708 --> 31:52.873
Yeah, alright. Sure.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.708
Okay. Here we go.

31:54.710 --> 31:57.946
<i>Hey, Deangelo.
I got a new bus buddy.</i>

31:57.948 --> 31:59.613
I guess she just wanted
a chance to say

31:59.615 --> 32:01.315
all the things
she didn't say to you.

32:01.317 --> 32:03.651
It was actually
kind of a word flood.

32:03.653 --> 32:05.253
Do you wanna hear?

32:05.255 --> 32:07.658
- No, not really.
- Yeah, I don't blame you.

32:09.226 --> 32:11.161
Leave it in the past.

32:15.399 --> 32:17.131
We, uh, actually ended up
hittin' it off.

32:17.133 --> 32:19.434
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah, she's a big laugher.

32:19.436 --> 32:20.936
I don't think
I'm that funny, but..

32:20.938 --> 32:22.903
Come on, you're funny.
I like your De Niro.

32:22.905 --> 32:24.374
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:25.441 --> 32:27.175
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

32:27.177 --> 32:30.078
- "Cape Fear."
- Do a line.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.880
I made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

32:31.882 --> 32:34.448
- That's Brando.
- It's eventually him, right?

32:34.450 --> 32:36.051
Him before, yeah. I guess.

32:36.053 --> 32:37.552
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

32:37.554 --> 32:39.353
Do, like, uh, "Goodfellas."

32:39.355 --> 32:41.957
- "Look who's talkin' too!"
- Jesus Christ.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.891
No, I know
that one's not right.

32:43.893 --> 32:45.695
"Were you talkin' to me?"

32:47.130 --> 32:49.563
That's honestly awful.

32:49.565 --> 32:52.399
Anyway, I thought, uh..

32:52.401 --> 32:54.872
I don't know.
I might ask her out.

32:56.305 --> 32:57.706
- Francesca?
- Yeah.

32:57.708 --> 32:59.573
You know, just,
if you're cool with it.

32:59.575 --> 33:01.976
- Yeah, I'm cool with it. Yeah.
- Good, 'cause I don't wanna..

33:01.978 --> 33:03.378
No, of course, sure.
Be my guest.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.845
You two are perfect together.

33:04.847 --> 33:06.783
- You sure?
- Yeah, I said I'm sure.

33:11.388 --> 33:12.419
Alright.

33:20.863 --> 33:23.398
A can of your cheapest beer,
please.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.499
Cooper, what a nice surprise.

33:25.501 --> 33:28.269
Alright. This place is great.

33:28.271 --> 33:30.205
Looks like it hasn't changed
in 50 years.

33:30.207 --> 33:31.939
Oh, you should see what it costs
to make it look that way.

33:31.941 --> 33:33.374
Oh, yeah? Are you the owner?

33:33.376 --> 33:35.409
- Me? No.
- Oh.

33:35.411 --> 33:38.045
I'm the day manager.
You know, easy come, easy go.

33:38.047 --> 33:42.182
Oh. Still drinkin' Pabst
in this neighborhood.

33:42.184 --> 33:45.019
We get it. It's terrible.
You're hilarious!

33:46.555 --> 33:47.721
Split it with me?

33:47.723 --> 33:50.057
No, no,
I can't drink on the job.

33:50.059 --> 33:51.995
Should have been
a kindergarten teacher.

33:54.297 --> 33:56.700
Maybe, uh, maybe another time?

33:58.901 --> 34:02.704
Uh, I'm gonna take a break
from men for a while.

34:02.706 --> 34:05.340
Especially since
I almost killed the last one.

34:05.342 --> 34:07.175
Last two,
come to think of it.

34:07.177 --> 34:08.777
Well, you are in luck.

34:08.779 --> 34:11.779
I've been told
I'm very difficult to kill.

34:11.781 --> 34:14.014
I do enjoy talking to you,

34:14.016 --> 34:16.451
and, um, I do find you charming

34:16.453 --> 34:21.022
in a sort of like Saint Bernard
kind of way.

34:21.024 --> 34:23.424
- Yeah.
- But Charlie..

34:23.426 --> 34:26.460
Hey, he's the one who set us up.

34:26.462 --> 34:27.795
I checked with him
and he's cool.

34:27.797 --> 34:29.531
I wouldn't be here
if he wasn't.

34:29.533 --> 34:31.399
- Hey, Francesca?
- Yeah?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.234
Is it okay
if I take my break early?

34:33.235 --> 34:34.569
I need to call my grandmother

34:34.571 --> 34:36.571
but there's a group
of drunk bike messengers

34:36.572 --> 34:39.540
who keep yelling the word
titties in the background.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.178
Of course, sweetheart.

34:43.245 --> 34:45.112
Hi, I'm Bethany.

34:45.114 --> 34:47.614
I like your shirt.
Is it pima cotton?

34:47.616 --> 34:50.918
I, uh, don't know.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.955
Oh. You would know
if it was pima.

34:53.956 --> 34:56.991
Pima cotton feels like
baby hair.

34:56.993 --> 34:59.226
Yeah, I guess it doesn't feel
like baby hair.

34:59.228 --> 35:02.332
Must be Egyptian cotton then,
which is also nice.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.766
- Phew.
- Yeah.

35:05.768 --> 35:07.101
Whoo.

35:07.103 --> 35:08.969
Phew.

35:08.971 --> 35:10.408
Okay, bye.

35:19.248 --> 35:20.681
Hey, hear me out.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.683
Uh, how would you feel
if we set up Charlie

35:22.685 --> 35:25.085
with someone
a little more his speed?

35:25.087 --> 35:29.223
I went to a seminar last night
on the history of sandals.

35:29.225 --> 35:33.428
It was called, uh,
"Walk 10,000 Years In My Shoes."

35:33.430 --> 35:35.897
Bethany?
Sounds like the kind of girl

35:35.899 --> 35:37.598
who had her own horse
growing up.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.033
No, I... I don't know
about that.

35:39.035 --> 35:40.601
I met her at the bar
where Francesca works.

35:40.603 --> 35:43.804
She's nothing like Francesca.
She's more, uh, restrained.

35:43.806 --> 35:46.540
- Oh, like shy?
- No. No, not exactly.

35:46.542 --> 35:48.143
Just, uh, she's not real
in your face.

35:48.145 --> 35:49.777
You know, actually, she...
she's kind of hard to hear.

35:49.779 --> 35:51.212
Cooper,
you don't have to do this.

35:51.214 --> 35:53.147
You can date Francesca
without finding me a sub.

35:53.149 --> 35:55.150
I'll be honest.
It started out that way

35:55.152 --> 35:58.752
but no joke,
this chick is perfect for you.

35:58.754 --> 36:00.288
One I can picture in sweatpants?

36:00.290 --> 36:02.656
Dude,
full top to bottom sweat suit.

36:02.658 --> 36:05.826
Now that's just creepy.
I'm not sure, man.

36:05.828 --> 36:08.696
The last thing I need right now
is to get overexcited again.

36:08.698 --> 36:10.698
Yeah, bro. I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.035
No?

36:13.236 --> 36:15.069
Hello.

36:15.071 --> 36:16.971
I was wondering if you could
point me to the section

36:16.973 --> 36:19.140
of your library
dealing with amaranth?

36:19.142 --> 36:21.609
Amaranth, the grain?

36:21.611 --> 36:23.111
Yes.

36:23.113 --> 36:26.214
The ancient grain
cultivated by the Aztecs

36:26.216 --> 36:28.116
<i>now enjoying
a quinoa-like comeback</i>

36:28.118 --> 36:30.654
thanks to its high protein
content and nutty flavor.

36:33.989 --> 36:35.993
- Uh, sure. Right this way.
- Okay.

36:39.196 --> 36:40.828
Ah, here.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.200
"Amaranth And You."

36:44.433 --> 36:46.667
It seems to have a lot of..

36:46.669 --> 36:49.506
...historical information
as well as recipes.

36:51.942 --> 36:54.442
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You're welcome. What?

36:54.444 --> 36:56.911
- Oh. Ah, I'm Bethany.
- Oh.

36:56.913 --> 36:58.580
<i>They said
we'd have a lot in common.</i>

36:58.582 --> 37:01.549
Right.
I guess they were right.

37:01.551 --> 37:04.118
- 'Cause you like books.
- Yeah.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.520
Yeah, I love them.

37:06.522 --> 37:07.955
I love the smell of them.

37:07.957 --> 37:09.123
- Mm-hmm.
- The old books.

37:09.125 --> 37:11.458
Yeah, that, you know,
that's called furfural.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.726
- Furfural?
- Yeah.

37:12.728 --> 37:14.828
- Oh.
- And furfural and vanillin.

37:14.830 --> 37:17.632
It's like, uh,
they're volatile compounds

37:17.634 --> 37:20.534
released by, uh,
decomposing paper and glue.

37:20.536 --> 37:23.437
There's probably some mold
in there as well.

37:23.439 --> 37:25.440
Some people find it
very, uh, you know...

37:25.442 --> 37:26.975
- Romantic.
- Romantic, yeah.

37:26.977 --> 37:28.112
Yeah.

37:30.446 --> 37:31.515
Oh.

37:38.254 --> 37:41.388
So, um, how does
amaranth and chickpeas

37:41.390 --> 37:43.326
with spring lamb sound?

37:45.995 --> 37:48.429
- Are you asking me out?
- No.

37:48.431 --> 37:50.698
No, I... I was just asking

37:50.700 --> 37:53.870
if that's something I should
make if you asked me out.

37:56.205 --> 37:59.473
Alright. Bethany, would you
like to go out some time?

37:59.475 --> 38:00.577
Oh.

38:07.683 --> 38:09.250
Okay.

38:09.252 --> 38:10.951
Good.

38:10.953 --> 38:13.154
Friday?

38:13.156 --> 38:15.455
Friday
I have yarn-making class.

38:15.457 --> 38:18.393
I'd skip it, but we're about
to take on alpaca, so..

38:18.395 --> 38:21.029
Oh, yeah. Uh, Saturday?

38:21.031 --> 38:22.733
- Saturday's great.
- Yeah.

38:24.466 --> 38:26.433
I'll make amaranth.

38:26.435 --> 38:28.303
- Look..
- Please.

38:28.305 --> 38:29.636
I like her.

38:29.638 --> 38:32.105
She's pleasant.

38:32.107 --> 38:34.007
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly
what she is.

38:34.009 --> 38:35.143
- She's pleasant.
- Right?

38:35.145 --> 38:36.476
I met her, I said

38:36.478 --> 38:38.379
"My God,
that is one pleasant girl."

38:38.381 --> 38:40.417
Yeah,
so we'll see how that goes.

38:42.319 --> 38:43.618
You goin' out with Francesca?

38:43.620 --> 38:45.719
Ooh, Mr. Cooper's
got a girlfriend.

38:45.721 --> 38:47.388
- Muah, muah, muah.
- Muah, muah, muah.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.991
Alright. You know
I don't like labels, Deangelo.

38:49.993 --> 38:51.558
You all know that.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.995
And, yes, I am going out
with Miss Francesca

38:53.997 --> 38:55.996
on Saturday night.

38:55.998 --> 38:57.598
Though where, I don't know.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.667
You gotta help me out.
What's this chick like to do?

38:59.669 --> 39:01.902
Don't ask me.
You're the one dating her.

39:01.904 --> 39:04.374
- You set us up.
- Technically, sure.

39:05.875 --> 39:07.908
Look, she's intimidating, okay?

39:07.910 --> 39:09.509
I feel like

39:09.511 --> 39:11.346
sometimes we're havin'
three conversations at once

39:11.348 --> 39:13.982
and I can't follow
one of them, you know.

39:13.984 --> 39:15.650
Alright, look, I know
she's really into Bauhaus.

39:15.652 --> 39:19.786
There's an Oskar Schlemmer
retrospective right now at MoMA.

39:19.788 --> 39:21.755
That's exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

39:21.757 --> 39:25.225
I need somethin' fun.
I need a good distraction.

39:25.227 --> 39:28.895
It doesn't take much
and this chick... goes dark.

39:28.897 --> 39:31.132
Yeah, Cooper, she's having
a tough time with her aunt.

39:31.134 --> 39:33.801
I know. I know,
and it's super sad. It is.

39:33.803 --> 39:35.870
So let's stop talkin' about it
already.

39:35.872 --> 39:37.371
I need to pee-pee.

39:37.373 --> 39:39.239
Yeah, you and me both,
Frederick.

39:39.241 --> 39:40.674
Alright, come on, guys.
Pick up the pace.

39:40.676 --> 39:42.609
High knees, huh? Let's go.

39:42.611 --> 39:44.547
How about just going somewhere..

39:47.216 --> 39:49.049
...uh, noisy?

39:51.721 --> 39:54.321
- How's your pisco sour?
- What?

39:54.323 --> 39:56.857
The pisco sour. Good?

39:56.859 --> 39:59.993
Only for about six months.

39:59.995 --> 40:02.429
Before that,
I was in San Francisco.

40:02.431 --> 40:03.634
Have you been?

40:05.035 --> 40:07.467
It's so good.

40:07.469 --> 40:10.071
Yeah, so tangy.

40:10.073 --> 40:11.906
♪ Hey-yah ♪♪

40:14.176 --> 40:15.877
No one saw it coming.

40:15.879 --> 40:18.612
Here everyone had psyched
themselves up for alpaca

40:18.614 --> 40:21.482
and the teacher breaks out
yak wool.

40:21.484 --> 40:22.917
One guy had to take a time out.

40:22.919 --> 40:25.152
Oh, sounds intense.
Thank you.

40:25.154 --> 40:26.788
Crazy intense.

40:26.790 --> 40:30.357
I guess from now on, I better
not get too comfortable.

40:30.359 --> 40:32.296
Not if you know
what's good for you.

40:34.163 --> 40:38.132
So, this is, um,
amaranth and chickpeas.

40:38.134 --> 40:41.301
But no lamb.
Sorry, I... I felt bad.

40:41.303 --> 40:42.937
Oh, no. That's... that's fine.

40:42.939 --> 40:45.205
It looks amazing.
Thank you so much for cooking.

40:45.207 --> 40:47.208
Oh, you're welcome.

40:47.210 --> 40:49.576
I like to cook
in other people's kitchens.

40:49.578 --> 40:52.179
It's like a little window
into their souls.

40:52.181 --> 40:54.949
Ah, what did you see in mine?

40:54.951 --> 40:57.118
Extremely dull knives.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.589
That's more accurate
than you'll ever know.

41:01.190 --> 41:03.292
Mm! It's good.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.794
- Do you have kids?
- What? No.

41:06.796 --> 41:08.196
No, why... why would you..

41:08.198 --> 41:09.996
I saw you have some foam

41:09.998 --> 41:12.833
<i>taped to the corner
of that table over there.</i>

41:12.835 --> 41:14.402
<i>Well, that's just what
my sister does</i>

41:14.404 --> 41:16.237
<i>for her son
who's learning to walk.</i>

41:16.239 --> 41:19.005
- Goddammit.
- Oh.

41:19.007 --> 41:22.379
- I don't mind kids, so..
- It's not that, Bethany.

41:24.413 --> 41:26.813
Alright, there's something
you deserve to know.

41:26.815 --> 41:29.650
I have cataplexy which means
that I can pass out

41:29.652 --> 41:33.788
any time I feel strong emotions.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.323
Strong emotions?

41:35.325 --> 41:36.457
- Like what do you...
- <i>It could be anything.</i>

41:36.459 --> 41:39.092
Like fear, anger, surprise,
all of that.

41:39.094 --> 41:41.098
In my case, it's mainly..

41:42.531 --> 41:44.632
It's mainly joy.

41:44.634 --> 41:47.368
Oh. That's horrible.

41:47.370 --> 41:49.837
Yeah, it's not great,
but listen

41:49.839 --> 41:52.339
there's nothing
saying I can't feel

41:52.341 --> 41:54.674
mild, tepid emotions.

41:54.676 --> 41:57.044
I can go to town on those.

41:57.046 --> 41:58.478
Oh, gosh.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.817
Did I get you too worked up
about the yarn?

42:03.386 --> 42:04.654
Um, nope.

42:05.989 --> 42:08.022
I guess we all have
something weird about us.

42:08.024 --> 42:09.556
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

42:09.558 --> 42:11.828
I'm sexually attracted
to Bob Newhart.

42:18.968 --> 42:20.967
- What?
- "Rock Lobster!"

42:22.205 --> 42:23.538

I brought over some movies,
but now I'm wondering.

42:55.538 --> 42:57.504
Have you seen "Secret Of NIMH?"

42:57.506 --> 42:59.707
I was such a basket case
at the end of that.

42:59.709 --> 43:02.176
I think I'll be okay.

43:02.178 --> 43:04.114
I'm sitting down already.

43:05.747 --> 43:07.683
I think
we should play it safe.

43:59.134 --> 44:02.169
<i>American churches
sheltered the dying..</i>

44:02.171 --> 44:03.904
- Ah.
- Whoo!

44:03.906 --> 44:07.375
Uh, let me get you a cab.
Or we could share?

44:07.377 --> 44:09.880
- You know, just..
- Hold on, it's my aunt.

44:10.879 --> 44:12.279
Is she waitin' up for you?

44:12.281 --> 44:14.781
Not waiting up.
More like throwing up.

44:14.783 --> 44:16.683
Oh, shit.

44:16.685 --> 44:18.219
Um, alright.

44:18.221 --> 44:21.288
Come back to my place,
open a bottle of wine.

44:21.290 --> 44:24.093
- I can't. I gotta check on her.
- Of course.

44:25.560 --> 44:28.431
Uh, you know, I could help.

44:29.598 --> 44:31.232
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

44:31.234 --> 44:33.333
Um, and besides,
I'd like to keep this separate.

44:33.335 --> 44:35.803
- Us separate, if that's okay.
- Yeah.

44:35.805 --> 44:37.971
Hey, think of me
as your... your weekend escape.

44:37.973 --> 44:40.507
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Uh, also free weekdays, so..

44:40.509 --> 44:42.812
But no pressure. Um..

44:45.480 --> 44:47.417
I'll probably just walk it.

44:58.294 --> 45:00.460
What are you..

45:00.462 --> 45:02.996
Ah, crap, this hurts.
How far am I?

45:02.998 --> 45:06.299
...your knee is facing up
and your toes are facing in.

45:06.301 --> 45:08.601
- About 3 feet.
- Oh.

45:08.603 --> 45:12.005
This girl says she can teach you
to do the splits in a day.

45:12.007 --> 45:13.741
That girl is nine years old,
Sylvia.

45:13.743 --> 45:16.042
Cocky little shit.

45:16.044 --> 45:18.078
I'd like to see her do this

45:18.080 --> 45:20.249
after 60 years
of lying around.

45:21.517 --> 45:24.585
Oh, um, I wanna talk to you
about something.

45:24.587 --> 45:26.687
Yeah? What is it?

45:26.689 --> 45:29.690
Well, if I'm gonna have
a mastectomy

45:29.692 --> 45:31.591
I'm thinking
about getting implants.

45:31.593 --> 45:34.261
Really big ones.
Like double Ds.

45:34.263 --> 45:36.062
Like proper gazongas.

45:36.064 --> 45:37.864
That's what you wanted
to talk to me about?

45:37.866 --> 45:39.500
Well, I wanted to prepare you.

45:39.502 --> 45:41.301
Well, thank you.

45:41.303 --> 45:43.404
Do whatever makes you happy.

45:43.406 --> 45:47.241
So, uh, how's it going
with Pooper?

45:47.243 --> 45:50.978
<i>Cooper! It's going great.</i>

45:50.980 --> 45:53.513
It was a little bit weird
dating Charlie's brother

45:53.515 --> 45:56.917
but to be honest,
I'm kind of glad he ended it.

45:56.919 --> 45:58.986
Yeah, you're already
taking care of one invalid.

45:58.988 --> 46:02.823
I mean, once I found out
about his situation

46:02.825 --> 46:06.060
I didn't wanna risk
hurting him again, you know.

46:06.062 --> 46:07.962
Yeah, you were
only thinking of him.

46:07.964 --> 46:10.797
And... and... and Cooper
is so much more my speed.

46:10.799 --> 46:13.634
I mean, he is so much fun.

46:13.636 --> 46:15.672
He makes me laugh so much.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.640
So what's next on my list?

46:19.642 --> 46:22.475
Oh, um, here we go.

46:22.477 --> 46:24.045
You wanna go to one of those

46:24.047 --> 46:25.846
"second floor
Asian massage places

46:25.848 --> 46:29.382
near Penn Station
and see if they actually do it."

46:29.384 --> 46:31.618
- It?
- You know..

46:31.620 --> 46:33.054
Wah! It!

46:35.658 --> 46:38.025
Seriously? Whatever happened
to hiking Machu Picchu?

46:38.027 --> 46:41.895
Oh! What hike?
I almost died!

46:41.897 --> 46:43.464
- You whore!
- Cut..

46:46.435 --> 46:47.868
Alright, just breathe.

46:50.138 --> 46:51.540
Give me that!

46:53.475 --> 46:54.744
Oh, you..

46:55.812 --> 46:57.413
Two to you.

46:59.147 --> 47:01.015
You bringing Bethany to Liza's
on Thursday?

47:01.017 --> 47:03.451
- She's dyin' to meet her.
- Uh, I guess so, yeah.

47:03.453 --> 47:06.953
- You bringing Francesca?
- Yeah, probably.

47:06.955 --> 47:10.491
Well, it's, uh, it's actually
a talk-heavy situation.

47:10.493 --> 47:12.359
Did I tell you
my newest discovery?

47:12.361 --> 47:13.893
Movie dates.

47:13.895 --> 47:17.397
Movie dates have actually
been around for some time.

47:17.399 --> 47:19.199
Yeah, 'cause they're amazing.

47:19.201 --> 47:20.868
You talk too much,
you get shushed.

47:20.870 --> 47:22.136
That's very clever.

47:22.138 --> 47:23.504
You know what,
I think at some point

47:23.506 --> 47:26.774
you might have to actually
talk to the woman you're dating.

47:26.776 --> 47:29.409
I guess, especially since
we're apparently

47:29.411 --> 47:30.944
waiting to have sex.

47:30.946 --> 47:32.946
- What?
- Yeah.

47:32.948 --> 47:34.884
I haven't jerked it this much
since high school.

47:36.752 --> 47:39.018
Interestingly, I found

47:39.020 --> 47:41.054
I've gone straight back
to Mexican telenovelas.

47:41.056 --> 47:42.957
Oh! <i>"La Fuerza Del Destino?"</i>

47:45.261 --> 47:47.828
Anyway, I guess it's because
of what happened with you.

47:47.830 --> 47:49.362
Why? Why?
What happened with me?

47:49.364 --> 47:52.199
Well, she said
she wants to stop using sex

47:52.201 --> 47:53.933
as a substitute for intimacy

47:53.935 --> 47:55.301
or maybe
it was the other way around.

47:55.303 --> 47:57.804
I don't know.
Anyway, it's all your fault!

47:57.806 --> 48:00.507
Yes. Yes!

48:00.509 --> 48:02.009
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:02.011 --> 48:04.777
I got you, brother. I got you.

48:04.779 --> 48:07.515
- <i>He alright?</i>
- Yeah. He's alright. Yep.

48:07.517 --> 48:11.886
Uh, here we have
the Temple of the Great Jaguar

48:11.888 --> 48:14.087
or the Temple Ah Cacao.

48:14.089 --> 48:16.656
It's a funerary pyramid

48:16.658 --> 48:20.361
from the Postclassic
classic period.

48:20.363 --> 48:23.029
Phenomenal. Just phenomenal.

48:24.799 --> 48:26.900
...to you for sharing.

48:26.902 --> 48:30.069
In 1962, they found the tomb
of the great Mayan ruler

48:30.071 --> 48:32.573
Jasaw Chan K'awiil.

48:32.575 --> 48:35.475
This is gonna take
a K'a-while longer.

48:35.477 --> 48:37.911
K'a-kill me now.

48:37.913 --> 48:41.214
<i>And here we're moving
into the North Acropolis</i>

48:41.216 --> 48:43.350
which is just beside
the Great Plaza.

48:43.352 --> 48:46.020
Do you have any maps? I'm having
trouble tracking the layout.

48:46.022 --> 48:48.221
There's a great
topographic survey coming up.

48:48.223 --> 48:50.290
Marv, where are the beach pics?

48:50.292 --> 48:51.725
You guys do anything
other than climb around

48:51.727 --> 48:53.027
old piles of rubble?

48:53.029 --> 48:54.895
All the recreational photos

48:54.897 --> 48:56.297
come after the intermission.

48:56.299 --> 48:57.330
- <i>Honey?</i>
- What?

48:57.332 --> 48:58.699
- What?
- Did he say intermission?

48:58.701 --> 49:00.701
We might need to do some shots.

49:00.703 --> 49:02.203
That's what
the intermission is for.

49:02.205 --> 49:03.937
- Oh, Lord.
- Ah.

49:03.939 --> 49:05.605
<i>That's similar
to the other pyramids</i>

49:05.607 --> 49:07.208
<i>I've shown you.</i>

49:07.210 --> 49:08.308
This is a map
just to give you a little bit

49:08.310 --> 49:09.777
of the lay of the land.
There's Tikal.

49:09.779 --> 49:11.612
- Wake up.
- I'm not sleeping.

49:11.614 --> 49:13.379
- You were snoring.
- I was not.

49:13.381 --> 49:15.015
Then maybe it was me.

49:15.017 --> 49:16.750
Am I dreaming now?

49:16.752 --> 49:18.219
You'll know if I'm dreaming

49:18.221 --> 49:21.221
if I start having sex
with Nala from "Lion King."

49:21.223 --> 49:24.158
Don't laugh.
This was my first crush.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.493
<i>You'll be out of breath
around stair four.</i>

49:26.495 --> 49:30.163
So is Belize
on 110 or 220 volt electricity?

49:30.165 --> 49:31.966
110, same as the US.

49:31.968 --> 49:34.534
Huh, really? In spite
of the British influence?

49:34.536 --> 49:35.868
<i>You know, that's fascinating,
really.</i>

49:35.870 --> 49:37.737
<i>Wow, you're not kidding.</i>

49:41.676 --> 49:43.676
You sure are
in a good mood today.

49:43.678 --> 49:45.179
- Me?
- Yeah.

49:45.181 --> 49:47.217
Yeah, I guess. This was fun.

49:48.783 --> 49:50.618
Are you on a new med?

49:50.620 --> 49:53.422
No. I mean,
I had a full-strength latte.

49:54.357 --> 49:56.757
- Why do you ask?
- Just..

49:56.759 --> 49:58.926
I don't know.

49:58.928 --> 50:01.362
You seemed so happy just
yuckin' it up with Francesca

50:01.364 --> 50:04.297
and I was pretty sure
you couldn't even talk to her.

50:04.299 --> 50:05.332
That was before that.

50:05.334 --> 50:08.636
...like,
"Oh, she's staying out there."

50:08.638 --> 50:10.136
Oh.

50:10.138 --> 50:12.105
So what?
You're not happy at all?

50:12.107 --> 50:15.908
No. No, I guess
I'm just unhappy enough.

50:15.910 --> 50:17.978
It's weird.
Suddenly I can be around her.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.313
Hmm.
And that makes you happy?

50:20.315 --> 50:21.882
- Yeah.
- Okay.

50:21.884 --> 50:23.917
Oh.

50:23.919 --> 50:25.953
Cooper's your shoe tack?

50:25.955 --> 50:27.855
- Come on. Does he know?
- No.

50:27.857 --> 50:29.589
No, he doesn't,
and I don't want you to tell him

50:29.591 --> 50:31.125
'cause that would make it weird.

50:31.127 --> 50:33.063
Yeah, that would make it weird.

50:34.363 --> 50:37.364
Is he holding out? Right?

50:37.366 --> 50:40.667
Dude, she's smokin'.

50:40.669 --> 50:45.138
I mean, you know that
I'm all about the boys, but I..

50:45.140 --> 50:47.109
Uff, I would.

50:49.477 --> 50:51.377
- Hey.
- Hey! Whoa, whoa! What?

50:51.379 --> 50:53.746
- We need to talk.
- <i>Right now?</i>

50:53.748 --> 50:55.815
Yeah.

50:55.817 --> 50:57.984
I can't do this anymore.

50:57.986 --> 50:59.553
I'm literally dying
from blue balls.

50:59.555 --> 51:01.054
Seriously? Can this wait?

51:01.056 --> 51:02.623
A man has needs, Charlie

51:02.625 --> 51:05.462
and I would think
that a woman does, too, but..

51:06.529 --> 51:07.795
Did that sting?

51:07.797 --> 51:09.495
Like I've told you,
she's having a rough time...

51:09.497 --> 51:10.931
I know. I know she is.

51:10.933 --> 51:12.766
I know and I feel for her.
I do.

51:12.768 --> 51:14.467
I just don't know
that I'm the guy.

51:14.469 --> 51:16.672
I don't know that I'm cut out
for this, you know.

51:17.872 --> 51:19.806
- I think we need to break up.
- No!

51:19.808 --> 51:21.408
No, absolutely not.

51:21.410 --> 51:24.178
Look, you're getting along
okay otherwise, right?

51:24.180 --> 51:25.978
- Yeah.
- Now she's having problems.

51:25.980 --> 51:28.649
And you are helping a person
with her problems.

51:28.651 --> 51:31.551
Don't just throw her away
so that we never see her again.

51:31.553 --> 51:32.888
- We?
- You.

51:34.056 --> 51:36.255
Yeah, no. No, yeah. Right.

51:36.257 --> 51:38.324
You're saying it's about her,
it's not about me.

51:38.326 --> 51:41.027
It's definitely not about you.

51:41.029 --> 51:43.029
Oh, okay.

51:43.031 --> 51:45.833
- I can get to know her better.
- That's an idea.

51:45.835 --> 51:47.368
- She is interesting.
- Right.

51:47.370 --> 51:49.136
- Does not own a TV.
- Get out.

51:49.138 --> 51:51.237
No, really doesn't own a TV.

51:51.239 --> 51:52.839
Wow. There you are.

51:52.841 --> 51:55.141
Look at this as a chance
to... to better yourself.

51:55.143 --> 51:56.944
Learn to cook,
take tango classes.

51:56.946 --> 51:59.082
Better still, I'll hook you up
with a library card.

52:00.882 --> 52:02.482
- Okay.
- Right?

52:02.484 --> 52:04.350
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

52:04.352 --> 52:05.819
Yeah, this is gonna be good.
It's gonna be good.

52:05.821 --> 52:07.087
I read the "New Yorker"
at the dentist.

52:07.089 --> 52:09.089
I own corduroys.
I can do this!

52:09.091 --> 52:10.656
I have faith in you.

52:10.658 --> 52:12.993
Plus, when we do have sex..

52:15.431 --> 52:17.467
- I have less faith.
- Yeah.

52:19.134 --> 52:21.100
- Thanks, brother.
- You're welcome.

52:21.102 --> 52:23.370
- I couldn't do it without you.
- I know.

52:23.372 --> 52:25.808
- Whoa.
- Sorry. It's the blue balls.

52:27.475 --> 52:30.710
Marvin, thank you so much.
That was, uh, that was thorough.

52:30.712 --> 52:32.011
It was my pleasure, and sorry

52:32.013 --> 52:34.147
I couldn't get that audio track
set up in time.

52:34.149 --> 52:36.116
It's really the groan
of the howler monkey

52:36.118 --> 52:38.152
that puts you back
into the jungle.

52:38.154 --> 52:39.786
It's like, it's...

52:39.788 --> 52:42.188
Oh, hey!
We're fine. We're fine.

52:42.190 --> 52:43.457
<i>Oh, you know what?</i>

52:43.459 --> 52:44.824
Did you guys ever use

52:44.826 --> 52:46.826
those groomsmen's presents
we got you?

52:46.828 --> 52:48.661
- Uh..
- Um, no.

52:48.663 --> 52:50.397
- Not yet.
- What is it?

52:50.399 --> 52:52.632
We got them each a night
at this B&B up in Rhinebeck.

52:52.634 --> 52:54.067
And especially for Charlie.

52:54.069 --> 52:56.737
It's, uh, pretty boring
out there.

52:56.739 --> 52:58.038
Sounds great.

52:58.040 --> 53:00.406
But anyway, I was thinking
it would be kind of fun

53:00.408 --> 53:02.576
if you guys
all went together though.

53:02.578 --> 53:04.143
Yeah. I don't... I don't know.
I don't need to...

53:04.145 --> 53:05.712
- Oh, let's do it.
- <i>Why not?</i>

53:05.714 --> 53:08.449
- We could go apple picking.
- Are apples in season?

53:08.451 --> 53:10.616
Uh, berry picking.

53:10.618 --> 53:12.685
As long as we pick somethin',
right?

53:12.687 --> 53:15.392
Uh, that sounds like fun.
I mean, why not, right?

53:16.292 --> 53:18.558
Why not?

53:18.560 --> 53:20.594
- Sure. Why not?
- Why not?

53:20.596 --> 53:22.132
Why not?

53:23.665 --> 53:24.964
♪ Whoo ♪♪

53:32.674 --> 53:33.940
- Oh, my..
- This is it! This is it!

53:33.942 --> 53:35.942
- Do you guys see it?
- This is it! This is it!

53:35.944 --> 53:38.245
Left. Left. Left. Left turn!

53:38.247 --> 53:40.880
- Oh, here?
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

53:40.882 --> 53:43.484
- Alright!
- Hey!

53:43.486 --> 53:44.951
<i>Alright, babe.
Alright, alright.</i>

53:44.953 --> 53:48.087
- <i>Oh, thank goose.</i>
- <i>Yep, thank goose.</i>

53:48.089 --> 53:50.156
- I'm so relieved to be alive.
- Alright.

53:50.158 --> 53:52.426
<i>Apollo 13
had an easier landing.</i>

53:52.428 --> 53:54.862
- Need a hand?
- Yes, please.

53:54.864 --> 53:56.295
Well, it's beautiful.

53:56.297 --> 53:57.931
I vote we stay here
for the rest of our lives

53:57.933 --> 53:59.632
and never get
in that car again.

53:59.634 --> 54:02.301
We got here, didn't we?
What a bunch of little bitches.

54:02.303 --> 54:05.471
<i>Yeah, little bitches who would
like to survive the weekend.</i>

54:05.473 --> 54:06.940
<i>Thank you.</i>

54:06.942 --> 54:08.408
Oh, what is this?

54:08.410 --> 54:10.911
Oh, it's my cello in case
we wanna have a singalong.

54:10.913 --> 54:12.513
Can... can you sing along
to cello?

54:12.515 --> 54:14.647
- You can do anything you want.
- Attagirl.

54:14.649 --> 54:16.415
Let me, let me. Ah!

54:16.417 --> 54:18.784
Would you mind?
Thanks a lot.

54:18.786 --> 54:21.522
Oh, oh, please be careful.
It's an antique.

54:21.524 --> 54:23.623
Hey, we... we'll get this stuff.
You guys go check in, huh?

54:23.625 --> 54:25.792
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

54:25.794 --> 54:27.094
- You got everything?
- Yeah.

54:27.096 --> 54:28.661
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah?

54:28.663 --> 54:30.763
You sure you're okay with this?

54:30.765 --> 54:32.498
- With what?
- With me and Francesca.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.766
You guys
are actin' kind of funny.

54:33.768 --> 54:35.636
No, yeah, of course.
I told you. It's fine.

54:35.638 --> 54:38.605
We went on, what, one date?
And half of that in the ER.

54:38.607 --> 54:40.841
It's... it's in the past.
I'm with Bethany now.

54:40.843 --> 54:44.143
Okay. Good, 'cause I think
this weekend's it.

54:44.145 --> 54:45.314
It?

54:52.321 --> 54:54.254
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

54:54.256 --> 54:55.788
- What's the occasion?
- There's no occasion.

54:55.790 --> 54:58.025
I'm just gettin' that vibe
she's ready, you know.

54:58.027 --> 54:59.625
Lord knows I've been ready.

54:59.627 --> 55:02.995
I tell you I'm off telenovelas?
I'm on to the food network.

55:02.997 --> 55:05.132
Had a big old week
with that Rachel Ray.

55:05.134 --> 55:07.000
That's upsetting.

55:07.002 --> 55:09.239
- Giada De Laurentiis, maybe.
- Really?

55:10.339 --> 55:12.605
Hey, hey, hey.

55:12.607 --> 55:15.444
Hey, we're all checked in.
This place is great.

55:16.879 --> 55:18.578
You're gonna love our room.

55:18.580 --> 55:20.813
It's like something
out of a "Nancy Drew" novel.

55:20.815 --> 55:22.449
Oh, I'm not sure
what that means, but..

55:22.451 --> 55:23.853
- Mm.
- Mm.

55:25.453 --> 55:28.321
Is that... just... little kisses?

55:28.323 --> 55:29.823
<i>Alright!</i>

55:29.825 --> 55:32.058
Those two aren't wastin'
any time.

55:32.060 --> 55:34.493
Oh, gosh, I'm such a skank.

55:34.495 --> 55:35.895
By all means, carry on.

55:35.897 --> 55:38.498
I think, uh,
we're gonna take a nap.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.600
<i>Oh, no. Wait! Wait! Wait!</i>

55:40.602 --> 55:42.234
Already? We just got here.

55:42.236 --> 55:44.705
Actually, I'm feeling
kind of carsick too.

55:44.707 --> 55:46.839
Come on. We haven't come
all this way just to sleep.

55:46.841 --> 55:48.442
Let's go, uh,
let's go antiquing.

55:48.444 --> 55:50.409
- Antiquing?
- Yeah.

55:50.411 --> 55:51.678
Since when do you antique?

55:51.680 --> 55:53.980
Are you kidding?
I love old crap.

55:53.982 --> 55:56.018
Could use another butter churn.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.187
You know, why not?
Let's check out the town.

56:00.189 --> 56:02.491
We'll sleep tonight.
Let's do it.

56:04.727 --> 56:06.062
We'll just.. Yeah.

56:08.062 --> 56:09.498
What?

56:10.933 --> 56:13.567
- Oh, dang. It is muggy.
- Hmm.

56:13.569 --> 56:15.167
Why didn't we take the car
again?

56:15.169 --> 56:18.071
Because Francesca's driving
and we value our lives.

56:18.073 --> 56:19.839
It's not my fault
New Yorkers drive so slow.

56:19.841 --> 56:22.477
Literally, no one else
has ever thought that.

56:27.015 --> 56:29.985
Liza was right.
This place is boring.

56:31.085 --> 56:33.687
Hey, well, how about this one?

56:33.689 --> 56:35.589
Ooh, it says shop.

56:35.591 --> 56:37.324
Phenomenal.

56:37.326 --> 56:39.625
Yeah, I... I just wish
there were more

56:39.627 --> 56:41.527
racist lawn jockeys.

56:41.529 --> 56:43.362
What?

56:43.364 --> 56:46.636
You know, I'm... I'm about
ready to head back.

56:51.806 --> 56:53.473
No way.

56:53.475 --> 56:56.342
Is that a trombone
that someone turned into a lamp?

56:56.344 --> 56:58.444
- Amazing.
- Oh, my God!

56:58.446 --> 57:00.781
My aunt had a tea set
just like this.

57:00.783 --> 57:02.582
Oh, my God,
is she an Oompa Loompa?

57:02.584 --> 57:04.917
- Yes, she is.
- Good for her.

57:04.919 --> 57:06.953
And this mixer. We had this!

57:06.955 --> 57:08.688
This thing is so loud,
it would wake me

57:08.690 --> 57:10.790
out of a dead sleep
whenever she made pancakes.

57:10.792 --> 57:13.125
Speaking of,
anybody feelin' snacky?

57:13.127 --> 57:14.194
I saw a taco place a couple...

57:14.196 --> 57:15.929
Did you live with Sylvia
growing up?

57:15.931 --> 57:18.230
Uh, on and off.

57:18.232 --> 57:20.466
It was really cool being a kid
and getting to come visit

57:20.468 --> 57:22.169
your fancy aunt
in New York City.

57:22.171 --> 57:24.670
I got to spend
an entire summer with her.

57:24.672 --> 57:26.172
It wasn't until later
that I realized

57:26.174 --> 57:28.074
it was so I wouldn't be around

57:28.076 --> 57:30.710
um, to see my mom getting chemo.

57:30.712 --> 57:33.779
- Wh... when did she die?
- I was 17, senior year.

57:33.781 --> 57:35.984
Uff, super sad.

57:38.286 --> 57:41.187
I dropped out and I, uh,
just started traveling.

57:41.189 --> 57:43.125
I wanted to be
a million miles from there.

57:44.625 --> 57:47.226
- Never really came home again.
- Huh.

57:47.228 --> 57:50.129
Well, I guess Sylvia is my home.

57:50.131 --> 57:51.630
She sounds like
a fantastic lady.

57:51.632 --> 57:54.935
She is a pain in the ass.
But I love her.

57:54.937 --> 57:56.902
- Oh, hey. Charlie?
- Yeah?

57:56.904 --> 57:58.237
Could you give me a hand
with this?

57:58.239 --> 57:59.973
I... I got you, Bethany.

57:59.975 --> 58:01.911
Just, I'm a lot taller.

58:03.245 --> 58:05.181
Ooh, look at this sweet baby.

58:06.181 --> 58:07.547
Do you think we should, uh..

58:07.549 --> 58:10.016
Come on, it's an instrument.
It's for playing.

58:10.018 --> 58:11.286
Yeah.

58:12.855 --> 58:15.855
Oh, man.
I guess it's broken.

58:15.857 --> 58:17.690
Oh, wait, look.
It's not plugged in.

58:17.692 --> 58:19.192
Yes!

58:19.194 --> 58:22.228
Have you ever seen such
a nice display of birds' eggs?

58:22.230 --> 58:23.732
Okay, try it now.

58:27.770 --> 58:29.835
<i>Alright!</i>

58:29.837 --> 58:31.004
Hey, I didn't know you play.

58:31.006 --> 58:34.107
- Six years with Senora Paredes.
- Wow!

58:34.109 --> 58:36.710
Do that, do that again.

58:36.712 --> 58:39.245
Guys,
that's really goddamn loud.

58:39.247 --> 58:40.716
Uh-huh.

58:41.649 --> 58:43.315
Look! Oh!

58:43.317 --> 58:45.417
Now he comes.

58:45.419 --> 58:47.654
That organ's 50 years old!

58:54.395 --> 58:56.395
♪ The world showed
no compassion to me ♪

58:56.397 --> 58:59.299
♪ Oh pitiful creature
of darkness ♪

58:59.301 --> 59:01.000
♪ What kind of life
have you known? ♪

59:01.002 --> 59:03.170
- ♪ Oh oh oh ♪
- <i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

59:03.172 --> 59:04.538
Did they rehearse this?

59:04.540 --> 59:06.406
- ♪ Oh ♪
- ♪ Oh ♪♪

59:06.408 --> 59:08.741
Char, come on.
Get out of the tub.

59:08.743 --> 59:10.342
Unhand me, you lout!

59:10.344 --> 59:13.013
- Get out..
- Unhand me, you lout!

59:13.015 --> 59:14.815
Oh! Never! No!

59:14.817 --> 59:17.620
- Are you gonna stop?
- Yes, I will. I'll stop.

59:25.828 --> 59:27.928
I know. I know.

59:27.930 --> 59:30.496
Maybe you need to slow down.
I'm not saying anything.

59:30.498 --> 59:31.998
- I'm not saying anything.
- No, no, no.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.500
You're the one who brought up
the librarian convention.

59:34.502 --> 59:35.969
Come on, you gotta tell me.
What is that like?

59:35.971 --> 59:37.270
You wanna hear about that?

59:37.272 --> 59:41.241
It's like, uh, tons of sex

59:41.243 --> 59:43.076
tons of booze,
tons of drugs,

59:43.078 --> 59:45.245
all in orthopedic footwear.

59:45.247 --> 59:46.645
- It is.
- More wine?

59:46.647 --> 59:47.813
Yeah, more wine. Thank you.

59:47.815 --> 59:49.114
- <i>That's the ...</i>
- In sensible shoes.

59:49.116 --> 59:51.685
<i>Yeah, sensible shoes. Yeah.</i>

59:51.687 --> 59:53.520
Hey, you wanna hear
a Charlie story?

59:53.522 --> 59:55.254
Uh, he ever tell you that, uh

59:55.256 --> 59:56.556
he won the sixth grade
talent show?

59:56.558 --> 59:58.625
Mnh-mnh. This story's no good.

59:58.627 --> 59:59.625
You don't wanna hear this story.

59:59.627 --> 01:00:00.960
<i>Come on, you're bein' modest.</i>

01:00:00.962 --> 01:00:02.495
You had the crowd on their feet.

01:00:02.497 --> 01:00:04.496
I wanna hear.
What was your talent?

01:00:04.498 --> 01:00:05.998
Um..

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.033
Come on,
what was your talent?

01:00:08.035 --> 01:00:10.670
Uh, Tracy Turwel and I did the..

01:00:10.672 --> 01:00:13.573
...the big scene
from "Streetcar Named Desire."

01:00:13.575 --> 01:00:15.040
- You were Stanley Kowalski?
- I was.

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:16.576
- Stella!
- Yeah, thank you.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:18.044
- <i>Sorry, everyone.</i>
- Sorry.

01:00:18.046 --> 01:00:19.578
- <i>Yes. Yes, no, exactly.</i>
- Thank you.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.047
<i>That was fantastic, yeah.</i>

01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:22.549
- <i>Uh, only ...</i>
- That was better.

01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:23.750
<i>Yes,
that was two octaves lower.</i>

01:00:23.752 --> 01:00:25.185
<i>Because Charlie's
an 11-year-old boy</i>

01:00:25.187 --> 01:00:26.353
whose voice has not changed.

01:00:26.355 --> 01:00:29.288
So there's a 4 foot,
80 pound kid on stage

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:32.225
screaming, "Stella!"

01:00:32.227 --> 01:00:34.393
- Hot.
- Wow, thanks.

01:00:34.395 --> 01:00:35.862
Yeah, that's not
even the best part.

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:37.062
- It is the best part.
- No.

01:00:37.064 --> 01:00:38.864
I made grown men weep.
What could be better?

01:00:38.866 --> 01:00:41.134
You blew the competition away.
That could be better.

01:00:41.136 --> 01:00:43.002
The girl who played
"Stairway To Heaven" on her oboe

01:00:43.004 --> 01:00:44.536
the boy who did the foxtrot
with his mom.

01:00:44.538 --> 01:00:45.538
<i>These... these are true.</i>

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.806
But Charlie, you know,

01:00:46.808 --> 01:00:49.074
the... the modest boy
that he is, sits quietly.

01:00:49.076 --> 01:00:50.743
<i>He hears his name
called as the winner.</i>

01:00:50.745 --> 01:00:53.013
- <i>He practically levitates ...</i>
- Cooper. Cooper.

01:00:53.015 --> 01:00:54.848
- <i>He sprints down the aisle ...</i>
- Cooper.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:56.949
<i>Come on.
He almost gets to the stage</i>

01:00:56.951 --> 01:00:59.752
and right then, bam!

01:00:59.754 --> 01:01:01.154
He's out like a light.

01:01:01.156 --> 01:01:03.589
He takes a head-first dive
into the orchestra pit.

01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:04.991
Splits his head open.

01:01:04.993 --> 01:01:06.826
There's blood everywhere

01:01:06.828 --> 01:01:09.929
kids are screamin',
fire trucks arrive.

01:01:09.931 --> 01:01:12.065
Long story short,
long story short.

01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:14.433
They cancel class
for the rest of the day.

01:01:14.435 --> 01:01:16.902
Now that is a talent.

01:01:16.904 --> 01:01:18.571
It's so sad.

01:01:18.573 --> 01:01:20.140
Hey, no. God, no.

01:01:20.142 --> 01:01:22.408
No, look, I... I won. I won.

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:24.911
- Nice work.
- What's the matter with you?

01:01:24.913 --> 01:01:27.279
Ah, everybody loved him for it.

01:01:28.283 --> 01:01:30.116
Oh, come on.

01:01:30.118 --> 01:01:31.618
Hey. Hey.

01:01:33.754 --> 01:01:36.992
Growing up,
I had this cat named Greg.

01:01:39.294 --> 01:01:41.194
He had feline epilepsy.

01:01:41.196 --> 01:01:42.696
<i>Oh.</i>

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:44.698
My brothers
had this strobe light

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.167
that they got from Radio Shack
and they would put it on him

01:01:47.169 --> 01:01:50.502
to make him have seizures
on purpose.

01:01:50.504 --> 01:01:52.806
They said he was breakdancing.

01:01:52.808 --> 01:01:55.241
- God, kids are assholes.
- Yeah.

01:01:55.243 --> 01:01:57.310
Charlie reminds me
a lot of Greg.

01:01:57.312 --> 01:01:58.514
Oh.

01:02:01.482 --> 01:02:03.183
Right in here.

01:02:03.185 --> 01:02:04.783
Well, I don't know
about anybody else

01:02:04.785 --> 01:02:06.920
but, uh, ooh,
this walk down memory lane

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:08.587
has got me pooped.

01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:10.757
What do you say we, uh,
we hit the hay, huh?

01:02:10.759 --> 01:02:12.926
- We haven't had dessert yet.
- I'm stuffed.

01:02:12.928 --> 01:02:14.761
They've got some pretty good
ports over there.

01:02:14.763 --> 01:02:17.529
- I prefer sherry.
- But..

01:02:17.531 --> 01:02:19.899
Or cello! We... we haven't had
our singalong.

01:02:19.901 --> 01:02:21.033
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:02:21.035 --> 01:02:22.971
Greg loved it when I played.

01:02:24.605 --> 01:02:26.573
It was the only thing
that stopped his seizures.

01:02:26.575 --> 01:02:27.743
Mm.

01:02:29.977 --> 01:02:31.180
By all means.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.013

Now on to the fun portion
of the evening..

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:02.034
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:04.504
- Ooh.
- Here we go.

01:04:04.506 --> 01:04:06.071
- Whoo!
- Na-na-na-na.

01:04:06.073 --> 01:04:08.143
Wow, this is the speed..

01:04:20.689 --> 01:04:23.259
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.192
<i>You've got my robe?</i>

01:04:27.194 --> 01:04:29.228
Yeah, come on.

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.498
Perfect fit.

01:04:34.035 --> 01:04:35.502
- Baby.
- What's up?

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.504
Don't get your man musk
on it, please.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.705
- Oh! No!
- Oh, too late.

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:45.114
<i>Make it stop. Please, please
make it stop. Hey.</i>

01:04:53.788 --> 01:04:55.658
- Hello there.
- Hey.

01:04:59.393 --> 01:05:02.295
Whoa. Are those deer?

01:05:02.297 --> 01:05:03.663
Sexy deer.

01:05:03.665 --> 01:05:05.732
Sexy deer. Yeah, they are.

01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:10.569
And you're, uh, whatever
hungry animal eats deer.

01:05:10.571 --> 01:05:12.105
Mountain lion.

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:14.677
A hungry mountain lion.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.344
No, much lower.

01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:22.383
Less throaty.

01:05:24.618 --> 01:05:26.585
- Argh, what?
- Argh.

01:05:26.587 --> 01:05:28.087
- Yeah. Yeah.
- <i>Argh. Okay.</i>

01:05:28.089 --> 01:05:29.424
<i>Argh.</i>

01:05:30.558 --> 01:05:32.391
- What?
- I'm... I'm the deer.

01:05:32.393 --> 01:05:33.495
<i>Oh, cool.</i>

01:05:36.064 --> 01:05:38.364
No, you're supposed
to come to me.

01:05:38.366 --> 01:05:39.464
- As the lion, right.
- Yeah.

01:05:43.038 --> 01:05:44.640
Yeah, that's good.

01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:50.475
Are you really hungry?

01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:52.645
- I am hungry.
- Yeah.

01:05:52.647 --> 01:05:54.813
- Yes! Ah!
- Get on over here!

01:06:02.323 --> 01:06:04.556
You ready?

01:06:04.558 --> 01:06:05.991
I'm ready.

01:06:15.569 --> 01:06:17.337
Are you getting overexcited?

01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:19.575
Ah, good so far.

01:06:21.743 --> 01:06:22.808
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:06:39.627 --> 01:06:41.729
Ooh! Oh, yeah.

01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:54.073
Oh, hello.

01:06:54.075 --> 01:06:56.609
It's always the quiet ones.

01:06:57.745 --> 01:06:59.478
- <i>Cooper! Cooper!</i>
- What?

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.580
<i>It's Charlie!
It's an emergency.</i>

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:02.884
Oh, come on.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.553
- Charlie.
- Oh, my...

01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:09.522
Oh, my God!

01:07:09.524 --> 01:07:11.190
Charlie!
Hey, are you alright?

01:07:11.192 --> 01:07:14.661
Yeah. Yeah, I think I,
I think I just had a seizure.

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:16.599
- Oh, no.
- Just like Greg.

01:07:18.198 --> 01:07:20.335
A seizure?
Normally, you just go limp.

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:24.002
I guess this time
I had a seizure.

01:07:24.004 --> 01:07:26.806
- We should call an ambulance.
- No. No ambulance.

01:07:26.808 --> 01:07:29.574
That's, uh..
Look, I'm... I'm fine, honestly.

01:07:29.576 --> 01:07:33.045
Yeah, you know, Charlie,
seizures are deadly serious.

01:07:33.047 --> 01:07:35.350
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You ought to be monitored.

01:07:37.852 --> 01:07:39.252
No, 'cause..

01:07:39.254 --> 01:07:41.757
Look, Coop,
I... I think it's passed.

01:07:47.462 --> 01:07:49.761
You know what? Better safe
than sorry. I'm calling.

01:07:49.763 --> 01:07:51.196
- No! No!
- <i>Yep. Yeah, I'm gonna call.</i>

01:07:51.198 --> 01:07:53.799
No ambulance! No..

01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:56.034
Look at that. I feel better.

01:07:56.036 --> 01:07:58.837
- Yeah, well, so it seems.
- Hmm.

01:07:58.839 --> 01:08:00.672
Guess that means
we can all go back to bed now.

01:08:00.674 --> 01:08:02.141
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

01:08:02.143 --> 01:08:04.079
Uh, I'm so sorry
for the inconvenience.

01:08:05.346 --> 01:08:07.382
- Feel better.
- Thank you. I will.

01:08:14.955 --> 01:08:16.721
I'm sorry.

01:08:16.724 --> 01:08:19.959
For now, I'm gonna have
to deny you the booty.

01:08:19.961 --> 01:08:22.598
- It's just not safe.
- I completely understand.

01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:26.068
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

01:08:27.535 --> 01:08:30.402
Alright, hey.
Alright, easy, tiger.

01:08:30.404 --> 01:08:31.737
Give me a chance
to get warmed up again.

01:08:31.738 --> 01:08:34.339
Yeah. For sure.
Pre-heat that oven.

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.377
What?

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.145
If that's Charlie,
I'm gonna wring his neck.

01:08:41.148 --> 01:08:42.214
<i>It could be my aunt.</i>

01:08:42.216 --> 01:08:44.049
So call her back
in five minutes.

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:45.720
Forty five minutes.

01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:50.221
You know, I'm just starting
to feel like

01:08:50.224 --> 01:08:53.661
you don't want me.

01:08:57.165 --> 01:08:59.096
Is it 'cause of the tattoos?

01:08:59.099 --> 01:09:00.932
Yeah, I regret some of them.

01:09:00.934 --> 01:09:03.035
Is this a little bit racist?
Yes.

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.871
Did I intend it that way?
No.

01:09:05.872 --> 01:09:07.108
Her scan.

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:10.546
The cancer spread.

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:16.649
Uh, Francesca,
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:09:16.651 --> 01:09:18.551
Oh, my God.

01:09:18.553 --> 01:09:20.986
This is it.

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:24.158
- This is when I lose her.
- No.

01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:28.831
She's, um..

01:09:30.764 --> 01:09:32.633
She's gonna be good.

01:09:34.368 --> 01:09:36.304
Yeah, she is,
she's gonna be good.

01:09:38.773 --> 01:09:39.975
Mm.

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.545
What's that?

01:09:49.584 --> 01:09:51.249
Unbelievable.

01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:53.618
I'm sorry.
You have an amazing ass.

01:09:53.621 --> 01:09:55.754
My aunt is dying of cancer.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:58.691
It doesn't know that.

01:09:58.693 --> 01:10:00.860
<i>Seriously?</i>

01:10:00.862 --> 01:10:02.527
I gotta get out of here.

01:10:04.599 --> 01:10:06.001
I..

01:10:07.734 --> 01:10:10.235
I'm not turned on
'cause she's got cancer!

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.515
Somewhere buried in there
is a compliment.

01:10:22.517 --> 01:10:23.852
Hey, what happened?

01:10:34.429 --> 01:10:36.465
I don't wanna talk about it,
Cooper.

01:10:38.899 --> 01:10:40.602
I should have known.

01:10:42.604 --> 01:10:44.673
I, uh, brought this.

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:47.509
Thanks.

01:10:52.947 --> 01:10:55.714
You don't have to be out here.
I can deal with this on my own.

01:10:55.716 --> 01:10:57.783
Mnh-mnh. Death and despair
are my specialties.

01:10:57.785 --> 01:10:58.817
You know that.

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:00.453
If she makes
a miraculous recovery

01:11:00.455 --> 01:11:02.390
then you're on your own.

01:11:04.826 --> 01:11:06.691
You know the constellations?

01:11:06.693 --> 01:11:10.029
Please, I grew up in the city.

01:11:10.031 --> 01:11:12.768
The first star I saw
was in the blackout of 2003.

01:11:16.871 --> 01:11:20.740
I used to sit outside for hours
as a kid

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:22.211
making up my own.

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:25.547
Flamingo with a suitcase.

01:11:26.813 --> 01:11:28.282
If you say so.

01:11:32.687 --> 01:11:35.087
It's nice to know
they'll always be there.

01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:44.597
How long does she have?

01:11:44.599 --> 01:11:48.467
She might buy some time
with chemo, but, um

01:11:48.469 --> 01:11:51.006
it metastasized to her liver,
so..

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.309
So that sucks.

01:11:57.545 --> 01:11:59.145
Anything
she's always wanted to do?

01:11:59.147 --> 01:12:01.179
Climb a mountain?
Travel to India?

01:12:01.181 --> 01:12:03.848
Fire a rocket launcher
at a Dodge Caravan.

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:04.952
Uh, what?

01:12:06.888 --> 01:12:09.024
Her ex used to drive one.

01:12:11.526 --> 01:12:13.325
She's done all that other stuff,
you know.

01:12:13.327 --> 01:12:16.361
I mean, that's the thing
about Sylvia.

01:12:16.363 --> 01:12:17.896
She doesn't wait
for anybody's permission.

01:12:17.898 --> 01:12:20.199
She just goes for it.

01:12:20.201 --> 01:12:22.237
- She's a bad-ass.
- Yeah.

01:12:24.104 --> 01:12:26.340
Not a lot of people live
that way. I know I don't.

01:12:32.647 --> 01:12:36.348
Charlie, the day you fell..

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:39.317
...you said you couldn't be
around me anymore, you know.

01:12:39.319 --> 01:12:42.187
We've seen each other
almost every day since

01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:44.856
and... here we are.

01:12:44.858 --> 01:12:46.928
Yeah, but this is
incredibly depressing.

01:12:48.429 --> 01:12:49.565
Come on.

01:12:51.064 --> 01:12:53.298
- At the antique store today?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.668
I mean,
you looked like you were..

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:57.906
You were having fun.
You were happy.

01:13:01.943 --> 01:13:03.979
I wasn't happy. I was amused.

01:13:05.612 --> 01:13:07.415
Well, right.

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.583
I was a little bit
more than amused.

01:13:10.585 --> 01:13:12.020
I... I was happy.

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.820
- Hey. Hey, Francesca.
- What?

01:13:14.822 --> 01:13:16.422
Wait. Please?

01:13:16.424 --> 01:13:18.359
Okay, I was... I was happy.

01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:23.795
I am happy... I'm happier
than I've ever been.

01:13:23.797 --> 01:13:25.367
And that's because of you.

01:13:26.733 --> 01:13:28.167
- But you're still standing.
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:28.169 --> 01:13:30.468
It shouldn't work, right?
I should be flat on my face.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.873
But, um, the thing is
every time I feel it

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:36.578
the happiness rising in me..

01:13:37.944 --> 01:13:39.880
...I look at you and Cooper
and..

01:13:41.948 --> 01:13:43.852
...I'm just sad enough.

01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:47.018
But I'm dating your brother.
I mean, I..

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.257
- You set us up.
- I know. That's why it works.

01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:54.763
Wow.

01:14:01.335 --> 01:14:03.401
I don't think we need
to be around each other anymore.

01:14:03.403 --> 01:14:04.772
Francesca.

01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:09.210
Francesca.

01:14:12.145 --> 01:14:14.346
Bethany, what, what are you
doing out here?

01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:16.350
Th... there's bugs of all sorts.

01:14:17.684 --> 01:14:20.386
There's something
really wrong with you.

01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:21.422
Yeah.

01:14:22.456 --> 01:14:23.722
I know.

01:14:23.724 --> 01:14:26.659
I tried to be upfront.

01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:28.897
Not that. You.

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:32.498
Me?

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.334
I am fun, Charlie.

01:14:35.336 --> 01:14:36.569
I'm really fun.

01:14:36.571 --> 01:14:38.573
Yeah. Of course, you are.
You're tons of fun.

01:14:40.474 --> 01:14:42.309
And I'm also pretty.

01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:45.977
I've been told that I'm pretty.

01:14:45.979 --> 01:14:48.246
You're beautiful.

01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:51.353
You let me to think
we, we actually had a chance.

01:14:54.188 --> 01:14:55.857
I wanna break up.

01:14:57.291 --> 01:14:58.994

- Hey.
- Hi.

01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:38.524
Hey, um, come on in.

01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:40.726
- Oh.
- How's Sylvia doin'?

01:16:40.728 --> 01:16:42.594
She's hangin' in there.

01:16:42.596 --> 01:16:44.562
Wow. Sunflowers.

01:16:44.564 --> 01:16:46.065
- Yeah.
- They're my favorite.

01:16:46.067 --> 01:16:48.200
From a real florist too.
Not just Trader Joe's.

01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:50.539
Oh.
Well, now I know I'm special.

01:16:51.906 --> 01:16:53.739
What's this?

01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:56.475
Uh, this is also for you.

01:16:56.477 --> 01:16:57.479
Oh.

01:16:58.612 --> 01:17:00.812
- What is it?
- Uh, that's the thing.

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:03.082
You know,
I didn't exactly pick it out.

01:17:03.084 --> 01:17:05.551
<i>I just sort of brought..</i>

01:17:05.553 --> 01:17:09.187
My aunt's mixer.

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:11.589
- You remembered.
- Yeah, I sure did.

01:17:11.591 --> 01:17:13.428
Oh, I love it.

01:17:14.895 --> 01:17:16.462
- Thank you. I..
- Yeah.

01:17:16.464 --> 01:17:19.231
I'm really sorry that
I blew up at you the other day.

01:17:19.233 --> 01:17:22.066
It's just.. It's been so hard.

01:17:22.068 --> 01:17:24.837
Yeah. Hey, you know..

01:17:24.839 --> 01:17:27.740
When one loses someone one loves

01:17:27.742 --> 01:17:29.909
one has to...

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.610
uh, look at..

01:17:32.612 --> 01:17:34.982
...one's sense of..

01:17:36.983 --> 01:17:37.982
...oneself.

01:17:37.984 --> 01:17:39.884
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

01:17:39.886 --> 01:17:41.488
Okay. So you know.

01:17:42.989 --> 01:17:44.890
Alright. Come on.

01:17:44.892 --> 01:17:47.293
Let's go get you some lunch.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.661
Oh, you know what?
I... I don't really feel like

01:17:49.663 --> 01:17:52.097
being in a crowded restaurant.
Why don't we just order in?

01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:53.365
Oh, come on.
It's so nice out there.

01:17:53.367 --> 01:17:54.799
We'll go find a place
with a patio.

01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:56.971
I'm really, just..
I'm exhausted.

01:17:59.005 --> 01:18:01.906
Oh, I thought you'd wanna get
your mind off your aunt.

01:18:01.908 --> 01:18:03.374
I do.

01:18:03.376 --> 01:18:06.477
I just can't keep running away
from it, you know.

01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:08.450
I just gotta deal with it, so..

01:18:09.684 --> 01:18:11.653
...you wanna help me deal
with it?

01:18:13.054 --> 01:18:14.489
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:18:15.589 --> 01:18:17.158
Let's deal with it.

01:18:19.727 --> 01:18:22.962
So, just lay it all out there.

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.896
Um..

01:18:24.898 --> 01:18:27.401
What do you fear most
about your aunt dying?

01:18:29.537 --> 01:18:30.772
Okay.

01:18:35.242 --> 01:18:38.980
Um, to start, missing her.

01:18:42.015 --> 01:18:44.085
Feeling alone in the world.

01:18:45.653 --> 01:18:49.655
Like, I didn't make the best
of our time together, you know

01:18:49.657 --> 01:18:52.658
and I'll never have those days
back. My childhood.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.227
Like I would rather it were me,
so I wasn't the one

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:56.962
stuck here without her.

01:18:56.964 --> 01:18:58.667
She's my best friend.

01:19:01.202 --> 01:19:04.272
You know, Francesca..

01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:07.873
...I..

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:10.011
...should..

01:19:10.944 --> 01:19:12.878
...go.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.279
- What? Where are you going?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:19:14.281 --> 01:19:15.981
- I just poured my heart out.
- <i>No, I know.</i>

01:19:15.983 --> 01:19:17.716
I know you did,
and, uh, I encouraged it

01:19:17.718 --> 01:19:19.752
so it's just as much on me.

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:21.219
You're being such an asshole!

01:19:21.221 --> 01:19:23.222
Uh, I know.
No, you're right. I am.

01:19:23.224 --> 01:19:25.891
Uh, just know,
I don't feel great about it.

01:19:25.893 --> 01:19:27.659
How can you be so thoughtful
one minute

01:19:27.661 --> 01:19:29.293
and then such a dick the next?

01:19:29.295 --> 01:19:30.464
Because..

01:19:31.866 --> 01:19:34.135
Because I wasn't
really that thoughtful.

01:19:36.202 --> 01:19:38.137
I..

01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:39.405
I am so sorry.

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:41.376
Uh, just.. Bye.

01:20:10.871 --> 01:20:12.905
Whoa! Watch it, shit bag!

01:20:12.907 --> 01:20:14.906
Thank you, New York.

01:20:14.908 --> 01:20:16.775
What'd you just say to me?

01:20:18.778 --> 01:20:19.980
Hey.

01:20:27.787 --> 01:20:29.221
She loved the mixer.

01:20:29.223 --> 01:20:31.722
Oh, yeah? What'd she say?

01:20:31.724 --> 01:20:32.960
"I love the mixer."

01:20:34.595 --> 01:20:36.197
Good, I'm glad.

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.664
All it took was one sad attempt

01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:41.633
at a conversation to end it.

01:20:41.635 --> 01:20:43.602
Couldn't we have just not
had that conversation

01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:44.636
a few weeks ago?

01:20:44.638 --> 01:20:45.937
What a waste.

01:20:45.939 --> 01:20:49.307
All this time, you could have
been humpin' it up.

01:20:49.309 --> 01:20:52.777
Why do I keep attracting
such vapid men?

01:20:52.779 --> 01:20:54.879
Unless, of course,
it's the other way around.

01:20:54.881 --> 01:20:56.380
They attract me?

01:20:56.382 --> 01:20:59.551
Like I'm into some sort
of pheromone in the hair gel?

01:20:59.553 --> 01:21:01.919
Well,
I just think you're attracted

01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:04.623
to what they aren't
as much as what they are.

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:06.258
You lost me, Yoda.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.625
That's not a dig
at your bald head.

01:21:07.627 --> 01:21:09.061
It better not be.

01:21:09.063 --> 01:21:12.196
Sylvia Torrone?
How you feeling, hon?

01:21:12.198 --> 01:21:14.766
A lot better now
than I will be in an hour.

01:21:14.768 --> 01:21:15.904
Here.

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:19.036
Face it, Francesca.

01:21:19.038 --> 01:21:21.539
- You're a total fox.
- Oh, stop it. I am not.

01:21:21.541 --> 01:21:25.177
You know you are, and it is
so annoying when you deny it.

01:21:25.179 --> 01:21:27.745
Fine, what's your point?

01:21:27.747 --> 01:21:29.882
My point is..

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.351
...men will always want you

01:21:32.353 --> 01:21:36.221
but it takes a special kind
of man to love you..

01:21:36.223 --> 01:21:39.557
...and to appreciate
just how truly special you are.

01:21:39.559 --> 01:21:40.892
You know, you gave me
that same speech

01:21:40.894 --> 01:21:42.160
when I had a unibrow, right?

01:21:42.162 --> 01:21:44.531
Yeah, I was lying then,
but this is about Charlie.

01:21:45.632 --> 01:21:48.167
He rejected me.

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:50.604
He's just doing what you do,
protecting yourself.

01:21:52.505 --> 01:21:54.975
Oh. This goddamn place.

01:21:56.609 --> 01:21:58.011
I know.

01:22:06.353 --> 01:22:09.387
- What exactly was your plan?
- What?

01:22:09.389 --> 01:22:12.324
Help us patch things up and..

01:22:12.326 --> 01:22:13.792
...just go on being miserable?

01:22:13.794 --> 01:22:15.627
But what makes you think
I'm miserable?

01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:17.562
Your face.

01:22:17.564 --> 01:22:19.364
Your miserable face.

01:22:19.366 --> 01:22:23.535
I... I just thought
it would make her happy.

01:22:23.537 --> 01:22:25.337
Well, it didn't really work out
like that.

01:22:25.339 --> 01:22:27.774
- We broke up.
- What? Why?

01:22:29.143 --> 01:22:31.246
'Cause I'm not in love with her
and you are.

01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:39.750
- Charlie does love me.
- Did he tell you?

01:22:39.752 --> 01:22:42.823
- As best he could.
- Do you love him?

01:22:49.162 --> 01:22:52.597
- How can I?
- Oh, Francesca.

01:22:52.599 --> 01:22:54.432
You can't keep yourself
from loving someone

01:22:54.434 --> 01:22:56.904
just because you're afraid
you're gonna lose them.

01:23:02.576 --> 01:23:04.176
But that didn't stop you
from dating her, did it?

01:23:04.178 --> 01:23:07.012
No. It did not,
and I regret that.

01:23:07.014 --> 01:23:10.816
Not 'cause I swooped on you,
but because you wanted me to.

01:23:10.818 --> 01:23:13.485
What the hell does that mean?

01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:17.356
Our whole lives, I have been
running interference for you.

01:23:17.358 --> 01:23:20.424
I've been taking your hits,
I've been watching your back

01:23:20.426 --> 01:23:22.660
and for a long time,
I liked that.

01:23:22.662 --> 01:23:24.295
I liked being that guy.

01:23:24.297 --> 01:23:26.097
Little bro
looking out for big bro.

01:23:26.099 --> 01:23:27.466
Whoa, easy. Easy, little bro.

01:23:27.468 --> 01:23:29.567
Hey, you known it's true.
You know it's true.

01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:31.335
I thought I was protecting you
and I wasn't.

01:23:31.337 --> 01:23:32.603
- You were using me.
- What?

01:23:32.605 --> 01:23:34.806
To hide behind, to manipulate,
like I'm some...

01:23:34.808 --> 01:23:37.142
- Where is this coming from?
- Where is this coming from?

01:23:37.144 --> 01:23:40.478
You treat me like I'm a big,
dumb, emotional battering ram

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.780
and I'm done!

01:23:41.782 --> 01:23:43.714
I'm done being
your emotional battering ram.

01:23:43.716 --> 01:23:47.119
- Look, no, you are not my...
- Battering ram.

01:23:47.121 --> 01:23:50.054
Yeah, look, just... just get
over yourself for one second.

01:23:50.056 --> 01:23:52.089
You don't have
this shitty disease, Cooper.

01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:53.258
You don't live in fear

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.393
of making a... a fool
of yourself all the time

01:23:55.395 --> 01:23:57.795
or maybe, I don't know,
fuckin' dying.

01:23:57.797 --> 01:24:00.031
You get to live your life
exactly how you wanna live it

01:24:00.033 --> 01:24:01.799
and you still fuck it up!

01:24:01.801 --> 01:24:04.035
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:24:04.037 --> 01:24:05.236
You know what?

01:24:05.238 --> 01:24:07.638
Charlie, I know better
than anyone.

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:10.008
I know better than anyone
how awful this disease is.

01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:12.447
- You do?
- I've seen kids laugh at you.

01:24:14.148 --> 01:24:15.513
You understand that?

01:24:15.515 --> 01:24:18.016
I watched kids
laugh at my big brother.

01:24:18.018 --> 01:24:20.017
I've seen you be alone.

01:24:20.019 --> 01:24:21.619
That sucks, man.

01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:23.789
I'm sorry.

01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:27.124
But there is a point where the
disease ends and fear sets in.

01:24:27.126 --> 01:24:29.194
- <i>Oh, not this. Not this.</i>
- And it becomes an excuse!

01:24:29.196 --> 01:24:30.494
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:24:30.496 --> 01:24:32.597
Oh, my God!
You just said you understand!

01:24:32.599 --> 01:24:34.533
You don't understand that
nobody wants to go on a date

01:24:34.535 --> 01:24:37.468
with a guy who's gonna end up
in the ER as soon as they kiss.

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:40.271
Being in a relationship
is about being happy!

01:24:40.273 --> 01:24:43.575
- I can't do that!
- Yes, yes, you can! You can!

01:24:43.577 --> 01:24:46.645
You just have to learn to be
okay with what comes next.

01:24:46.647 --> 01:24:47.849
That's all.

01:24:52.118 --> 01:24:53.587
Go, Charlie.

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:57.856
Hey, hey.

01:24:57.858 --> 01:24:59.658
- Go get her.
- I can't.

01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:01.660
- Watch it.
- No, you watch it.

01:25:01.662 --> 01:25:04.396
You understand? I mean,
do you actually understand?

01:25:04.398 --> 01:25:07.065
I can't. You can.
You can, but I can't.

01:25:07.067 --> 01:25:08.232
You're gonna get yourself
worked up.

01:25:08.234 --> 01:25:09.601
I wanna get worked up!

01:25:09.603 --> 01:25:13.304
Why do I never get
to be worked up? Huh?

01:25:13.306 --> 01:25:15.841
Take a breath, okay?

01:25:15.843 --> 01:25:18.211
- Calm down. Alright...
- Why?

01:25:21.215 --> 01:25:22.382
Why?

01:25:24.617 --> 01:25:25.986
Why?

01:25:29.456 --> 01:25:30.558
Why?

01:25:31.358 --> 01:25:32.591
Charlie!

01:25:35.328 --> 01:25:37.331
You gotta wake up, Charlie!
I can't hold on!

01:25:38.898 --> 01:25:40.966
Charlie!

01:25:40.968 --> 01:25:42.667
Help!

01:25:44.604 --> 01:25:46.637
Come on!

01:25:46.639 --> 01:25:48.142
<i>Charlie!</i>

01:25:52.345 --> 01:25:54.715
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:25:57.283 --> 01:25:59.353
Come on! I got you! I got you!

01:26:01.889 --> 01:26:03.190
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:07.225
- You alright, shit bag?
- Huh?

01:26:07.227 --> 01:26:08.563
Ah, you're alright.

01:26:09.595 --> 01:26:11.495
Thank you.

01:26:11.497 --> 01:26:13.231
Thank you, New York.

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.477
Yeah, okay.

01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:26.246
- Okay, what?
- I'll go.

01:26:28.148 --> 01:26:30.515
- You'll go?
- Yeah.

01:26:30.517 --> 01:26:32.950
- Sunday morning, after yoga.
- Oh, Charlie.

01:26:32.952 --> 01:26:36.221
No Sunday, no yoga.
You go right now!

01:26:36.223 --> 01:26:37.422
- Right now?
- Come on!

01:26:37.424 --> 01:26:38.957
- What?
- Come on!

01:26:38.959 --> 01:26:40.825
Alright. How do I look?

01:26:40.827 --> 01:26:43.594
Oh, terrible! You smell awful.

01:26:43.596 --> 01:26:46.464
You're wearing
a stupid tiny backpack..

01:26:46.466 --> 01:26:48.133
...but you gotta go.

01:26:48.135 --> 01:26:50.071
- I gotta go.
- You gotta go.

01:26:58.979 --> 01:27:00.645
Go be happy.

01:27:04.184 --> 01:27:05.887
Go be happy.

01:27:18.031 --> 01:27:20.899
Answer the phone, Francesca.

01:27:20.901 --> 01:27:23.504
Life is for living.
Answer the phone.

01:27:24.971 --> 01:27:26.504
- Charlie?
- <i>Francesca!</i>

01:27:26.506 --> 01:27:29.807
Wh... where are you?
I've gotta see you right now.

01:27:29.809 --> 01:27:31.879
Uh, in the hospital
with my aunt.

01:27:33.279 --> 01:27:36.082
Perfect. I'm on my way.

01:27:43.156 --> 01:27:44.722
<i>That's it. You're doing it.</i>

01:27:44.724 --> 01:27:47.292
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

01:27:47.294 --> 01:27:49.660
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it, Stanley.

01:27:49.662 --> 01:27:51.866
- You're walking.
- Oh, sit down, Stanley.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.468
Alright.

01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:57.438
Alright.

01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:02.910
You gotta be kidding.

01:28:06.712 --> 01:28:08.282
God help me.

01:28:20.126 --> 01:28:22.660
Charlie. Oh, my God. Whoa!

01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:25.030
- Okay. Right.
- What... what happened?

01:28:25.032 --> 01:28:28.432
A beautiful baby.
God. So beautiful.

01:28:28.434 --> 01:28:30.535
- Here. Have some water.
- Mm.

01:28:30.537 --> 01:28:32.070
- Mm, that's too refreshing.
- Whoa!

01:28:32.072 --> 01:28:34.204
- Yeah.
- Okay, sorry.

01:28:34.206 --> 01:28:35.774
- Is that Sylvia?
- Charlie.

01:28:35.776 --> 01:28:38.109
- How you doing?
- I've been better.

01:28:38.111 --> 01:28:40.378
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.748
- You said you wanted to see me.
- Yeah, God.

01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:45.549
Why do you gotta be so lovely?

01:28:45.551 --> 01:28:47.785
- You're pretty cute yourself.
- That's not helping.

01:28:47.787 --> 01:28:49.654
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Ugh!

01:28:49.656 --> 01:28:51.088
Do you wanna go
somewhere more private?

01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:52.626
No, this is good.

01:28:53.727 --> 01:28:55.660
Alright.

01:28:55.662 --> 01:28:57.628
Francesca, I..

01:28:57.630 --> 01:28:59.496
Hmm..

01:28:59.498 --> 01:29:01.499
Okay, okay.
Here. Here we go.

01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:04.272
Thanks. I can't..

01:29:07.239 --> 01:29:09.140
I can't drive with the radio on

01:29:09.142 --> 01:29:11.543
in case anything
by The Pointer Sisters comes on

01:29:11.545 --> 01:29:14.646
and I swerve into a ditch.

01:29:14.648 --> 01:29:17.015
I can't walk along any beach

01:29:17.017 --> 01:29:20.250
where there might be
frolicking seals.

01:29:20.252 --> 01:29:22.987
I can't eat kettle corn.
I can't boogie board.

01:29:22.989 --> 01:29:24.923
I can't swim
in any body of water

01:29:24.925 --> 01:29:26.958
that is higher than my chest

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.493
especially
if there's some guy playing

01:29:28.495 --> 01:29:30.962
with his gorgeous
golden retriever.

01:29:30.964 --> 01:29:33.298
I can't barbecue unsupervised.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.533
I probably can't go
to the Grand Canyon

01:29:35.535 --> 01:29:36.767
just based on the pictures
I've seen

01:29:36.769 --> 01:29:39.139
'cause it's too
breathtakingly beautiful.

01:29:42.142 --> 01:29:44.245
I would like to have kids..

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.647
...but they will either
have to be boring or spoiled

01:29:49.649 --> 01:29:51.615
because cute and adorable...

01:29:51.617 --> 01:29:52.919
Charlie.

01:29:54.254 --> 01:29:56.290
We'll adopt the worst kids
we can find.

01:30:01.428 --> 01:30:02.662
Hmm.

01:30:07.867 --> 01:30:09.668
Oh, kiss, goddamn it!

01:32:53.233 --> 01:32:54.468
