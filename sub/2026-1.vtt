02:12.345 --> 02:13.835
Goal!

03:24.551 --> 03:26.678
What was that? Ellie, did you hear that?

03:26.887 --> 03:29.219
I heard it, Manny.
Whatever it is, it's miles away.

03:29.389 --> 03:30.720
Peaches, are you all right?

03:31.258 --> 03:32.247
Where is she?

03:32.526 --> 03:34.517
No teenager is ever up early.

03:35.595 --> 03:37.790
Easy warden, she's not on lockdown.

03:42.469 --> 03:44.869
You two were supposed to be
responsible uncles!

03:44.938 --> 03:48.169
What? I didn't see Peaches sneak off
maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago.

03:48.241 --> 03:50.402
Or that she went with Louis to the falls.

03:50.477 --> 03:52.672
The falls? Where the delinquents go?

03:52.746 --> 03:54.839
Relax, it's just where the kids hang out.

03:54.915 --> 03:57.645
No, no, it's a gateway hangout.

03:57.717 --> 04:00.413
First it's the falls,
then she's piercing her trunk...

04:00.487 --> 04:02.682
and the next thing you know,
she's addicted to berries.

04:02.956 --> 04:06.221
Manny! You are overreacting.

04:06.393 --> 04:08.657
She's not going to be
your little girl forever.

04:08.828 --> 04:11.991
I know. That's what worries me.

04:14.668 --> 04:15.692
Come on!

04:18.572 --> 04:19.630
Louis!

04:19.706 --> 04:23.073
Would you get your head out of the ground
for once and try to have a little fun?

04:25.145 --> 04:28.376
I'm a molehog.
My head's supposed to be underground.

04:28.448 --> 04:32.680
And my idea of fun isn't risking death
so that you can meet some cute mammoth.

04:32.752 --> 04:35.949
Ethan isn't cute. He's hot.

04:36.923 --> 04:39.756
Besides, you can't spend your whole life
playing it safe.

04:39.826 --> 04:41.487
- I know I would.
- Dad?

04:42.162 --> 04:43.789
There's no reason to be mad.

04:43.964 --> 04:46.694
You know how I feel
about you going to the falls.

04:46.766 --> 04:47.960
Especially alone.

04:48.134 --> 04:49.692
She's not alone, sir.

04:49.869 --> 04:51.029
You don't count, Weiner.

04:51.204 --> 04:53.638
Yes, there's my place,
and you just put me in it, thank you.

04:53.707 --> 04:54.696
Come on, young lady.

04:54.941 --> 04:57.136
We're going home
where I can keep an eye on you.

04:59.546 --> 05:03.812
So, should I just wait here, or...

05:21.534 --> 05:23.968
Yeah, you don't scare me, Mother Nature!

05:24.137 --> 05:27.300
There's nothing you can throw at me
that I can't handle.

05:31.544 --> 05:32.568
I think we're almost there!

05:32.746 --> 05:35.306
We had better be! I just lost the steering.

05:39.219 --> 05:42.188
Has anyone seen Precious?
It's her feeding time.

05:42.355 --> 05:45.347
Mom! Granny's talking about
her dead pet again.

05:45.525 --> 05:47.516
Hey, paws up, everybody!

05:48.128 --> 05:51.359
Paws down, Uncle, please! That is nasty.

05:55.535 --> 05:58.231
Be careful, Milton,
you're going to hurt somebody!

05:59.205 --> 06:00.194
Bad kitty!

06:00.273 --> 06:01.297
Rock!

06:12.819 --> 06:16.516
Okay, so tell me, when exactly
will I be allowed to hang out with boys?

06:16.690 --> 06:20.490
When I'm dead, plus three days.
Just to make sure I'm dead.

06:37.477 --> 06:39.308
Manny, are you okay?

06:41.781 --> 06:45.478
Get off... my face!

06:46.519 --> 06:50.785
That was fun. Now, who should I eat first?

06:51.891 --> 06:53.051
No, no, no!

06:55.795 --> 06:58.730
Uncle Fungus! Could that really be you?

06:59.232 --> 07:00.392
Sorry, sorry.

07:01.401 --> 07:02.732
Mom, Dad!

07:04.471 --> 07:05.495
Marshall!

07:05.572 --> 07:06.698
- Hey!
- Granny?

07:06.806 --> 07:09.172
This pumpkin's ripe for picking!

07:09.342 --> 07:11.037
My whole familia.

07:11.211 --> 07:13.202
See? He still hugs his parents.

07:13.379 --> 07:15.513
I never thought I'd see
my little baby again.

07:15.514 --> 07:18.248
We've been searching everywhere for you.

07:18.418 --> 07:19.476
You have?

07:19.552 --> 07:22.749
I knew it, I knew it!
Deep down, I knew I wasn't abandoned!

07:23.656 --> 07:25.817
That's incorrect. We totally abandoned you.

07:25.892 --> 07:30.591
But we always missed you. Right?

07:30.764 --> 07:32.356
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:32.532 --> 07:36.161
And we just knew Sid
would want to see his poor, dear Granny...

07:36.336 --> 07:39.032
before her time is up.

07:39.205 --> 07:42.368
I'll bury you all and dance on your graves.

07:42.575 --> 07:43.599
So frail.

07:43.676 --> 07:46.941
And she can't wait
to spend time with you, Sid.

07:47.113 --> 07:50.514
Oh, yeah, Granny? Granny?

07:56.689 --> 07:59.055
- Granny.
- I never get to have any fun.

07:59.359 --> 08:02.692
Why don't you show her your cave?
Yeah, she could use a nap.

08:02.862 --> 08:04.625
Boy, there's so much to tell you.

08:04.798 --> 08:06.698
A lot has happened
since the last time I saw you.

08:06.866 --> 08:08.128
Not interested.

08:08.301 --> 08:10.769
But we fought dinosaurs in the lce Age.

08:10.937 --> 08:13.098
It didn't make sense,
but it sure was exciting.

08:13.606 --> 08:16.097
We got rid of the crazy bat! Let's go!

08:18.378 --> 08:20.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just leave.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.608
Sid will be crushed.

08:21.981 --> 08:23.949
Sorry, cookie,
things are breaking apart back home.

08:24.117 --> 08:27.450
So, we're headed inland.
And Granny is just dead weight.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.383
- See you.
- Mush, mush!

08:30.156 --> 08:34.592
And warn the community.
She tends to wander!

08:35.328 --> 08:37.558
Well, that explains a lot about Sid.

08:37.797 --> 08:41.096
Mom, Dad, do you have Granny's teeth?
She can't find them.

08:44.804 --> 08:46.965
Hey! Can you chew this thing for me?

08:47.640 --> 08:50.370
Guys? Where is everyone?

08:50.810 --> 08:52.038
I'll handle this.

08:53.780 --> 08:54.872
Sid?

08:56.282 --> 08:58.409
Your family was wiped out by an asteroid.
Sorry.

08:58.585 --> 08:59.745
What?

08:59.919 --> 09:03.411
What Diego is trying to say is...

09:03.990 --> 09:05.423
they left.

09:05.592 --> 09:08.823
They only wanted to find you
so you could take care of Granny.

09:08.995 --> 09:13.591
Come on, what kind of sick family
would ditch their Granny on someone?

09:13.766 --> 09:16.735
That's just crazy. That's just...

09:17.303 --> 09:18.770
That's just...

09:19.806 --> 09:21.034
...my family.

09:22.342 --> 09:24.902
At least you still have Granny.
Right, buddy?

09:25.078 --> 09:27.740
Yeah, Granny. Granny?

09:28.214 --> 09:29.238
Granny?

09:29.315 --> 09:32.113
Wow. For an old girl, she moves fast.

09:36.489 --> 09:38.286
- Granny?
- Granny.

09:38.358 --> 09:39.382
Granny?

09:39.459 --> 09:40.858
Come out, come out wherever you are!

09:40.927 --> 09:41.951
Come on, Granny.

09:42.028 --> 09:46.431
Here, Granny, Granny.
I have prunes for you!

09:46.599 --> 09:48.794
Just the way you like them!

09:50.536 --> 09:52.629
I don't want to see that.

09:55.842 --> 09:57.104
Oh, no.

09:57.477 --> 10:00.378
What if your dad finds out?
I'm not as tough as I look!

10:00.546 --> 10:02.480
Wait, do you hear that?

10:10.490 --> 10:11.787
Go long!

10:15.862 --> 10:16.920
Cool!

10:17.463 --> 10:18.953
Hey, look, there's Ethan.

10:19.632 --> 10:21.293
Yeah, Ethan!

10:21.467 --> 10:22.695
You go, boy!

10:23.169 --> 10:24.727
That was nice.

10:26.506 --> 10:27.700
Yeah!

10:30.043 --> 10:32.068
See? Fun, no danger.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.242
Check me out!

10:42.155 --> 10:45.852
- I'm sure he's fine.
- I'm completely not fine!

10:47.260 --> 10:51.424
You did not just do that! That was crazy!

10:51.831 --> 10:52.923
Nice.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.364
Yeah!

10:56.069 --> 10:57.593
Isn't he perfect?

10:57.670 --> 11:01.231
"Perfect." lt's such a strong word.
Maybe "adequate."

11:01.307 --> 11:02.365
Who are we stalking?

11:02.442 --> 11:03.909
Is it Ethan? I bet it's Ethan.

11:03.977 --> 11:05.604
- Hey, Weiner.
- What are you guys doing here?

11:05.678 --> 11:07.111
Manny told us to keep an eye on you.

11:07.180 --> 11:10.206
- But not to let you see us.
- Under any circumstances.

11:11.084 --> 11:13.882
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

11:14.253 --> 11:18.087
Okay, I'm going for it. Do I look okay?

11:18.424 --> 11:19.448
Louis?

11:20.927 --> 11:23.896
"Okay" doesn't even begin to cover it.

11:24.564 --> 11:27.761
Louis. You're the greatest friend ever!

11:30.703 --> 11:31.931
That's me.

11:32.105 --> 11:35.370
Hi, Ethan, my name's Peaches.
What's yours?

11:36.042 --> 11:39.910
What am I doing?
Okay, just be cool, just be...

11:42.348 --> 11:43.372
No!

11:44.784 --> 11:47.116
Yeah. That's intense!

11:50.289 --> 11:51.483
This hurts so much!

11:52.959 --> 11:55.757
No! No! No!

12:00.900 --> 12:05.064
Gross. It's that weirdo
who chills with possums!

12:05.872 --> 12:07.305
What just happened?

12:07.373 --> 12:10.240
Oh, no! Ethan, I am so sorry.

12:10.410 --> 12:12.640
Wow, you're even better-looking up close.

12:12.812 --> 12:14.712
Phenomenal. I mean...

12:15.381 --> 12:17.281
You have a twin sister?

12:17.450 --> 12:19.145
Am I interrupting something?

12:19.719 --> 12:21.050
- Dad!
- Oh, boy. Okay...

12:21.120 --> 12:22.212
Sorry, if I just...

12:22.288 --> 12:24.518
- Wait, no, you go left.
- Just move back a bit.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.683
You! Keep away from my daughter.

12:26.759 --> 12:28.556
- Dad...
- And you, you're grounded!

12:28.628 --> 12:30.220
- But I didn't do...
- Grounded!

12:30.296 --> 12:31.729
Loser alert.

12:31.898 --> 12:33.593
Ouch, that's her dad.

12:33.766 --> 12:35.996
Seriously, that's embarrassing.

12:36.069 --> 12:37.093
What a freak.

12:38.971 --> 12:40.268
Peaches!

12:44.277 --> 12:46.177
Peaches, come on. Let's talk about this!

12:46.345 --> 12:48.779
How could you embarrass me
in front of my friends?

12:48.948 --> 12:52.076
You deliberately went
where you weren't supposed to!

12:52.251 --> 12:53.809
You can't control my life!

12:53.986 --> 12:57.080
I'm trying to protect you!
That's what fathers do.

12:57.256 --> 13:00.316
Well... I wish you weren't my father.

13:03.296 --> 13:04.820
She's just upset, honey.

13:05.431 --> 13:08.195
Peaches! It's not the end of the world.

13:13.673 --> 13:15.436
Whoa. Excuse me.

13:15.608 --> 13:16.939
I don't think that was you.

13:21.714 --> 13:23.648
- What was that?
- I don't know.

13:24.383 --> 13:25.645
Stay there.

13:25.885 --> 13:27.318
I'll come to you.

13:36.295 --> 13:37.853
- Ellie!
- Manny!

13:39.866 --> 13:41.197
No!

13:43.136 --> 13:45.001
- Dad!
- Peaches, get back!

13:53.179 --> 13:54.305
Hurry, Dad! Hurry!

13:54.380 --> 13:55.404
Manny!

13:56.415 --> 13:58.349
- Diego!
- You never would have made it!

14:11.564 --> 14:13.327
Ellie, behind you!

14:13.499 --> 14:14.659
What's happening?

14:19.238 --> 14:22.571
Go to the land bridge!
You'll be safe on the other side.

14:22.808 --> 14:24.002
No, Manny! No!

14:24.177 --> 14:25.644
I'll meet you there!

14:37.390 --> 14:40.018
Manny! No!

14:40.193 --> 14:44.152
Ellie, you have to get out of here!
Go! Go now!

14:57.777 --> 14:59.574
- Mom!
- Get back! Get back!

15:25.738 --> 15:27.205
Daddy!

15:29.275 --> 15:31.869
Stay alive!

15:32.044 --> 15:36.947
No matter how long it
takes, I will find you!

15:37.116 --> 15:40.449
Mom, this is all my fault.
If I had just listened...

15:40.620 --> 15:42.986
Peaches! This is not your fault, okay?

15:43.155 --> 15:46.420
What if I never see him again?
And the last thing we did was fight.

15:46.592 --> 15:51.052
Hey, your father is the toughest,
most stubborn mammoth I've ever met.

15:51.230 --> 15:54.222
He'll come back for us. That's a promise.

16:00.172 --> 16:02.538
Come on!
Help me turn this thing around!

16:12.218 --> 16:16.052
Everyone, please, settle down. Don't panic!

16:16.789 --> 16:19.622
Wait, Mom, where's Louis?
We have to find him.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.084
Okay, fast.

16:30.536 --> 16:32.333
They need me! We got to get back.

16:32.405 --> 16:35.897
Buddy, this thing's too big to turn.
The current's pulling us out.

16:35.975 --> 16:40.207
You know, my mother once told me that
bad news was just good news in disguise.

16:40.279 --> 16:41.837
Was this before she abandoned you?

16:41.914 --> 16:43.142
Yes, it was.

16:43.215 --> 16:46.343
But the point being that,
even though things look bad...

16:46.452 --> 16:48.977
there's a rainbow around every corner...

16:49.455 --> 16:53.414
and nothing but smooth sailing ahead!

16:57.430 --> 16:58.727
Smooth sailing, Sid?

17:07.073 --> 17:09.233
- Louis? Louis?
- Louis?

17:09.407 --> 17:12.377
Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!

17:12.545 --> 17:15.480
Louis where are you?
Come on, we have to go.

17:21.619 --> 17:22.644
Louis?

17:22.821 --> 17:24.118
Peaches!

17:26.125 --> 17:28.286
Louis, you have to jump.

17:29.495 --> 17:31.520
No! Go, save yourselves.

17:31.597 --> 17:33.292
We're not leaving without you.

17:33.366 --> 17:34.355
Oh, thank goodness.

17:34.433 --> 17:35.491
Jump!

17:41.140 --> 17:43.540
This is why I travel underground.

17:51.283 --> 17:52.580
Thanks for coming back.

17:52.651 --> 17:55.586
What do you mean?
You don't leave a friend behind.

17:56.122 --> 17:58.352
Great, let's go.

17:58.524 --> 18:00.924
That wall is going to keep moving
and crush us.

18:01.093 --> 18:03.152
We need to get to the land bridge.

18:03.362 --> 18:04.386
Any questions?

18:05.798 --> 18:06.822
Yes?

18:07.199 --> 18:11.533
When you drink water through your trunk,
does it taste like boogers?

18:12.104 --> 18:13.196
No.

18:13.272 --> 18:15.638
Well, sometimes. Let's move!

18:29.155 --> 18:32.022
Just keep your eye on the horizon.

18:32.091 --> 18:34.559
I can't find the horizon.

18:41.634 --> 18:43.033
Holy crab!

18:57.183 --> 18:58.343
Hold me.

19:00.052 --> 19:01.383
If I don't make it...

19:01.587 --> 19:05.045
find me a wife, and tell her I love her.

19:14.900 --> 19:15.992
We made it!

19:16.068 --> 19:19.595
Come on, ocean,
is that the best you can do?

19:19.672 --> 19:21.139
Am I right, buddy?

19:36.322 --> 19:39.758
Hey, there really is a rainbow
around every corner!

19:56.742 --> 19:58.266
Peaches!

20:04.717 --> 20:06.241
You okay?

20:06.519 --> 20:08.282
I'm just so worried about my dad.

20:08.454 --> 20:10.183
Listen, we're going to get to him.

20:10.356 --> 20:12.017
At this pace, we'll
stay ahead of the wall...

20:12.191 --> 20:14.352
and we'll make it to the land bridge
before you know it.

20:15.694 --> 20:17.958
We're all gonna survive this.

20:22.801 --> 20:26.396
Okay, maybe they won't.
But everyone else, totally fine.

20:47.826 --> 20:50.226
We're still heading away from home.

20:53.766 --> 20:56.701
Yeah, but we survived,
and we still have each other.

20:56.769 --> 20:58.202
Things could be worse, right?

20:58.270 --> 21:00.135
For once, he's actually right.

21:00.205 --> 21:02.537
We made it through storms
and tidal waves...

21:02.608 --> 21:05.441
and a vicious assortment of seafood.

21:05.978 --> 21:07.343
What more can they hit us with?

21:07.980 --> 21:10.005
Trying to make me get up
if I don't want to get up.

21:10.082 --> 21:11.106
If I want to get up I'd get up.

21:11.183 --> 21:12.172
Hello?

21:13.152 --> 21:14.176
What the...?

21:14.253 --> 21:15.982
Dagnabbit, I'm trying to sleep!

21:16.155 --> 21:17.645
Granny? You're alive!

21:17.823 --> 21:20.417
And can we say
how thrilled we are to see you?

21:20.593 --> 21:23.426
Hey, fats, you want to get me out of here?

21:24.930 --> 21:26.591
Hey, come on.

21:26.765 --> 21:29.393
Pretend I'm a dessert,
that should motivate you.

21:32.905 --> 21:35.806
I can't believe this.
You slept through that storm?

21:36.442 --> 21:39.809
I slept through the comet
that killed the unicorns.

21:40.613 --> 21:42.444
Thanks for drawing my bath, Sidney.

21:42.615 --> 21:44.981
- Granny, grab my paw.
- No way.

21:45.451 --> 21:48.011
This is my first bath in decades.

21:50.623 --> 21:51.681
There's your proof.

21:51.757 --> 21:54.191
Quick! Somebody do something!

21:58.163 --> 22:00.290
- I got you, Granny.
- Get off of me!

22:02.635 --> 22:03.761
Granny!

22:07.339 --> 22:09.330
What are you peeping toms all looking at?

22:09.808 --> 22:13.300
A lady can't take a bath in peace?
Eyeballing me like a rump roast.

22:13.479 --> 22:16.812
What's the life expectancy
for a female sloth?

22:17.316 --> 22:19.750
She'll outlive us all, you know that, right?

22:19.818 --> 22:22.480
Yeah, the spiteful ones live the longest.

24:34.987 --> 24:38.252
How big is this ocean?

24:38.857 --> 24:42.315
Water, water, everywhere

24:42.995 --> 24:45.555
Nor any drop to drink

24:45.631 --> 24:47.292
Well, except maybe that drop.

24:51.537 --> 24:54.267
That's a little... salty.

24:54.439 --> 24:58.500
Precious! Mommy's calling you.

24:58.677 --> 25:01.544
Precious! Come here, sweetie.

25:01.713 --> 25:03.772
Hey, lady, have you seen Precious?

25:03.949 --> 25:06.383
If you mean the imaginary,
or perhaps deceased, pet...

25:06.451 --> 25:10.080
that you keep searching for, no, I haven't.

25:10.255 --> 25:11.279
Guys, look.

25:11.623 --> 25:14.114
Where there's birds, there's land, right?

25:14.193 --> 25:15.626
Hey, buddy, come here.

25:17.896 --> 25:19.295
No, wait, wait! Come back.

25:21.266 --> 25:22.528
Come back!

25:34.246 --> 25:36.612
It's a huge bounty, mon capitaine.

25:36.782 --> 25:40.445
Four passengers. Ripe for the taking.

25:40.619 --> 25:44.055
One very smelly, and one very plump.

25:44.223 --> 25:46.157
In my ocean?

25:46.325 --> 25:48.987
What a terrible turn of events.

25:49.161 --> 25:52.653
I love a terrible turn of events.

26:03.675 --> 26:06.906
Am I hallucinating,
or is that ice coming straight towards us?

26:07.079 --> 26:10.014
Yeah, yeah, it's coming.
It sounds like there's animals on it.

26:10.182 --> 26:13.583
Yippee!
We're being rescued, we're being rescued!

26:13.719 --> 26:15.016
I hear laughter.

26:15.621 --> 26:17.248
Must be a party cruise.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.071
Hey, they look fluffy.

26:44.249 --> 26:46.149
I get the big woolly one.

26:49.922 --> 26:51.287
Wow.

26:53.358 --> 26:55.622
Get ready to slice and dice, boys.

26:55.794 --> 26:57.284
- Knock it off, Squint.
- Hey!

26:57.462 --> 26:58.759
Wait for Captain's orders.

26:59.364 --> 27:00.922
Ahoy, down there!

27:01.533 --> 27:03.865
How lucky are you?

27:04.036 --> 27:07.130
You know these waters
are infested with pirates.

27:07.306 --> 27:08.830
Right, boys?

27:09.007 --> 27:11.032
Glad we found you before they did.

27:13.645 --> 27:16.307
Captain Gutt, here to help.

27:16.615 --> 27:18.879
You know, that's a nice monkey.

27:23.956 --> 27:27.448
Look, we don't want any trouble.
We just need to get back to the continent.

27:27.626 --> 27:30.686
The continent? That pile of rubble?

27:33.699 --> 27:35.724
My family's there, so if you could just...

27:36.568 --> 27:40.026
Your family? That is so sweet.

27:40.205 --> 27:44.141
I hope you said goodbye,
because there's no way back.

27:44.309 --> 27:47.642
Yes, there is.
Don't you remember, Captain?

27:47.813 --> 27:51.180
You can sail to Switchback Cove
and catch the current back from there.

27:51.350 --> 27:53.545
It's like a steel trap, this noggin is.

27:53.719 --> 27:55.744
Thank you, Mister Flynn.

27:57.489 --> 27:59.514
See? I knew there was a way home.

27:59.691 --> 28:00.988
There is no home!

28:03.161 --> 28:04.651
There is only here.

28:04.830 --> 28:08.596
And here, your ship belongs to me.

28:10.035 --> 28:11.263
Battle stations!

28:17.109 --> 28:18.599
Fly the colors!

28:21.613 --> 28:25.743
Now surrender your ship or face my fury.

28:25.884 --> 28:27.476
Or face your furry what?

28:27.719 --> 28:30.085
Not "furry." Fury!

28:30.255 --> 28:31.688
Fire!

28:35.127 --> 28:37.152
Hit the mammoth, win a prize.

28:37.729 --> 28:39.356
Ding, ding, ding.

28:39.698 --> 28:41.222
Fire the starboard cannons.

28:41.299 --> 28:43.529
I love this job!

28:43.602 --> 28:44.796
Shira, fetch.

28:44.870 --> 28:46.235
Aye-aye, Captain.

28:50.942 --> 28:52.102
You almost made it.

28:52.177 --> 28:53.371
I don't fight girls.

28:57.315 --> 28:58.373
I can see why.

28:59.284 --> 29:00.876
Belly flop.

29:02.721 --> 29:03.745
Sid!

29:03.822 --> 29:05.847
Let's rumba, Tiny.

29:06.124 --> 29:07.614
Lights out, big fella.

29:13.565 --> 29:14.896
Manny!

29:24.076 --> 29:25.134
Hello.

29:25.410 --> 29:26.672
Hey, buddy.

29:27.079 --> 29:28.808
Welcome to the party.

29:31.416 --> 29:34.249
Let's see what kind of moves you got.
Dance, little Scrat fish!

29:34.419 --> 29:35.977
Dance your coconuts off!

29:37.489 --> 29:39.150
Happy dance.

29:42.994 --> 29:44.825
Look at him.

29:45.130 --> 29:47.428
Where's my bootie? Has anyone seen it?

29:47.599 --> 29:49.191
Dude, it's right behind you.

29:49.367 --> 29:51.301
Where? Where's my bootie?

29:51.470 --> 29:52.937
I can't see it.

29:53.105 --> 29:54.766
It's all I can see.

29:55.173 --> 29:58.370
This is a lovely vacation.
Best I've ever had.

29:59.044 --> 30:00.477
Morning, sunshine.

30:00.545 --> 30:04.777
Let me be the first
to extend the hand of friendship.

30:05.283 --> 30:06.307
That's your foot.

30:07.519 --> 30:09.419
Nothing gets by you, does it?

30:09.488 --> 30:10.750
What do you want?

30:10.822 --> 30:14.815
I bet you're feeling lost, scared, confused.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.587
Allow me to explain.

30:16.761 --> 30:18.160
Help me out, boys.

30:18.497 --> 30:21.125
Captain's going to sing a shanty!

30:22.267 --> 30:24.098
<i># Here you are on a boat #
# You're adrift, you're afloat #</i>

30:24.169 --> 30:25.796
<i># One might even say you're stuck #</i>

30:25.971 --> 30:28.235
<i># Well, I don't want to gloat #
# But I would like to note #</i>

30:28.306 --> 30:29.671
<i># That you're in luck #</i>

30:29.741 --> 30:32.073
<i># You've been saved by the ape #
# That rules these waters #</i>

30:32.310 --> 30:34.005
<i># So forget about #
# Your wives and daughters #</i>

30:34.312 --> 30:37.304
<i># First Mate introduce me #
# to them, please #</i>

30:37.816 --> 30:39.147
<i>Aye-aye, Captain Gutt.</i>

30:39.818 --> 30:41.786
<i># He's the big and scary #
# Elegant yet hairy #</i>

30:41.953 --> 30:43.887
<i># Fear-inspiring #
# Years from retiring #</i>

30:44.055 --> 30:45.955
<i># Looting, stealing #
# Banana peeling #</i>

30:46.158 --> 30:48.649
<i># Undisputed Master of the Seas #</i>

30:48.727 --> 30:49.716
<i>Oh, jeez.</i>

30:49.794 --> 30:50.783
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

30:50.862 --> 30:51.851
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

30:51.930 --> 30:52.919
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

30:52.998 --> 30:53.987
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

30:54.733 --> 30:58.863
<i># I'm a primate pirate pioneer #
# And these are my brave buccaneers #</i>

30:59.037 --> 31:01.562
<i># All of whom were once #
# Lost souls like you #</i>

31:01.740 --> 31:02.729
<i># lt's true #</i>

31:02.874 --> 31:04.705
<i># He rescued us #
# He saved our butts #</i>

31:04.910 --> 31:06.707
<i># For that we owe our lives to Gutt #</i>

31:06.878 --> 31:08.937
<i># And assuming he doesn't kill you #</i>

31:09.114 --> 31:11.344
<i># You will owe him, too #</i>

31:11.516 --> 31:12.881
Kill them?

31:13.051 --> 31:14.780
Me? No, no.

31:15.253 --> 31:19.519
Well, at least not this
very large, useful mammoth.

31:19.691 --> 31:21.090
Hey, hands off.

31:21.259 --> 31:22.453
Anyway...

31:22.627 --> 31:24.686
<i># Here we are on a ship #
# Moving at quite a clip #</i>

31:24.763 --> 31:26.230
<i># Through the ever-shifting ice #</i>

31:26.565 --> 31:27.589
<i># Come along on a trip #</i>

31:27.666 --> 31:28.690
<i># That's a hint #
# That's a tip #</i>

31:28.767 --> 31:29.756
<i># That's good advice #</i>

31:30.702 --> 31:34.604
<i># In a world that's going under #
# To survive you must learn to plunder #</i>

31:34.773 --> 31:36.900
<i># Luckily that's my field of expertise #</i>

31:37.008 --> 31:37.997
<i># He's the best. #</i>

31:38.143 --> 31:40.236
<i># He's a robbing, thieving #
# We really should be leaving. #</i>

31:40.412 --> 31:42.209
<i># Weapon throwing #
# We got to get going. #</i>

31:42.380 --> 31:44.371
<i># Sloth-slaying #
# Wish we could be staying. #</i>

31:44.549 --> 31:46.210
<i># Undisputed #
# Uncontested #</i>

31:46.384 --> 31:48.375
<i># Monkey suited #
# Yeah, you guessed it #</i>

31:48.553 --> 31:50.987
<i># Master of the seas #</i>

31:51.056 --> 31:52.080
<i>Oh, please.</i>

31:52.157 --> 31:53.146
<i># That's me #
# 'Tis he #</i>

31:53.225 --> 31:54.214
<i>- That's me
- 'Tis he</i>

31:54.292 --> 31:55.281
<i># It's who? #
# It's you #</i>

31:55.360 --> 31:56.384
<i>Just testing, I knew.</i>

31:56.461 --> 31:58.725
<i># It's me #</i>

31:58.797 --> 32:00.162
Good shanty, sir.

32:00.565 --> 32:03.056
"Captain Gutt"? Really?

32:03.268 --> 32:07.136
I have a little paunch, too,
but I wouldn't name myself after it.

32:08.673 --> 32:10.903
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

32:11.076 --> 32:13.135
But that's not how I got my name.

32:13.311 --> 32:15.279
These got me my name.

32:15.447 --> 32:17.108
- I don't get it.
- No?

32:17.282 --> 32:18.681
Okay.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.183
Let me give you a visual aid.

32:20.352 --> 32:22.286
I just gently press here.

32:22.754 --> 32:27.191
- That tickles.
- And go down like this.

32:27.792 --> 32:30.488
And then your innards
become your outards.

32:32.998 --> 32:34.192
I still don't get it.

32:34.266 --> 32:37.633
Look, as much as I'm tempted
to join a monkey...

32:37.869 --> 32:41.703
the Easter Bunny
and a giant bag of pudding...

32:41.873 --> 32:43.170
l'll pass.

32:43.241 --> 32:45.368
No one's going to stop me
from getting back to my family.

32:46.411 --> 32:48.641
I'm going to lambada
with your liver, buddy.

32:49.748 --> 32:50.976
Let me at him!

32:52.484 --> 32:57.615
That family is going to be the death of you.

32:58.056 --> 32:59.785
First mate, jettison the deadweight.

32:59.858 --> 33:01.587
Aye-aye, sir. Prepare the plank!

33:01.760 --> 33:03.193
Prepare the plank!

33:03.361 --> 33:04.828
Preparing the plank!

33:07.666 --> 33:09.463
What?
You want me to walk into the water?

33:09.534 --> 33:13.368
I can't because I just ate less than
20 minutes ago, and you know the rule.

33:13.438 --> 33:14.769
That's a myth.

33:14.839 --> 33:17.137
Okay, as long as it's safe.

33:19.711 --> 33:21.611
- Wait!
- Thank goodness.

33:21.780 --> 33:23.645
Dump the wench, too.

33:24.749 --> 33:26.614
Ladies first.

33:26.718 --> 33:28.709
Such a nice boy.

33:28.787 --> 33:31.449
Why can't you be more like him, Sidney?

33:31.523 --> 33:33.423
Granny, no! Wait!

33:34.693 --> 33:35.853
Manny!

33:36.428 --> 33:37.952
Get me to the vine.

33:38.963 --> 33:40.555
Yeah, yeah, got it.

33:45.637 --> 33:47.832
You all got some ugly goldfish.

33:48.773 --> 33:50.764
Come on, a little more.

33:57.749 --> 33:58.773
No!

34:01.753 --> 34:03.084
Extinct that mammoth.

34:03.154 --> 34:05.486
Come on, Manny, kick his monkey butt!

34:05.657 --> 34:07.090
Look at you.

34:07.158 --> 34:10.127
Eleven tons of landlubber blubber.

34:10.195 --> 34:12.958
Hey, I'm not fat! I'm poufy.

34:13.164 --> 34:16.132
Too bad, Tubby. I could have used you.

34:16.266 --> 34:17.529
Ain't going to happen, Captain.

34:25.310 --> 34:26.937
I got you, Granny.

34:27.112 --> 34:29.045
Giddy up, let's go, let's go.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.550
Does anyone have floaties?

34:41.525 --> 34:43.460
No! No!

34:43.628 --> 34:45.322
My bounty!

35:00.879 --> 35:03.609
They sunk our battleship.
What are we going to do?

35:03.681 --> 35:05.308
We're all going to drown.

35:06.017 --> 35:09.009
You're a sea creature, you idiot.

35:09.621 --> 35:11.179
Good point, sir.

35:11.923 --> 35:13.049
Should I fly the white, captain?

35:13.124 --> 35:14.386
No!

35:14.459 --> 35:16.393
Wait, what about Shira?

35:16.461 --> 35:18.554
- What about her?
- Yeah, what about her?

35:18.630 --> 35:21.531
Anyone else want to play "Captain"?

35:22.033 --> 35:23.125
Good.

35:23.201 --> 35:26.602
Now come on, blubber-brain. Swim.

35:28.306 --> 35:31.764
Hey! Gutt! Flynn! Anyone there?

35:31.843 --> 35:33.310
Here, grab hold.

35:33.711 --> 35:36.373
No, go away. I'd rather drown.

35:36.448 --> 35:37.847
Whatever the lady wants.

35:42.887 --> 35:44.752
I said I didn't need your help.

35:44.956 --> 35:48.756
You're welcome.
So, care to join our scurvy crew?

35:50.595 --> 35:52.563
Two sloths, a mammoth and a saber?

35:52.730 --> 35:54.823
You guys are like the start of a bad joke.

35:54.899 --> 35:56.594
And we saved you.

35:56.668 --> 35:58.795
That makes you the punch line, kitty.

35:59.737 --> 36:01.568
Don't call me "kitty."

36:01.639 --> 36:03.402
Okay, I won't...

36:03.908 --> 36:04.932
Kitty.

36:05.009 --> 36:06.704
If they kiss, I'm going to puke.

36:06.778 --> 36:09.246
What? Wait, no.

36:26.197 --> 36:27.824
Are we there yet?

36:31.135 --> 36:32.864
I don't think we're ever going to get there.

36:34.172 --> 36:36.106
Maybe we should rest for a few hours.

36:36.941 --> 36:37.965
Thank you.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.040
Night, Ellie.

36:51.222 --> 36:52.849
I miss you, Dad.

36:54.659 --> 36:57.127
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

36:57.395 --> 36:58.419
Ethan!

36:58.496 --> 36:59.758
Hi.

37:02.534 --> 37:03.831
I meant to do that.

37:04.502 --> 37:06.493
I've never seen a mammoth sleep like that.

37:06.571 --> 37:09.005
What? No, this just helps me think.

37:09.641 --> 37:13.042
It gets blood to the old noggin
and away from the old... whatever.

37:15.647 --> 37:18.912
Okay, that's a little weird.

37:23.054 --> 37:26.820
So, how are you doing, you know,
with all of this?

37:26.891 --> 37:29.519
Honestly, a little scared.

37:30.161 --> 37:31.992
Okay, a lot scared.

37:32.130 --> 37:33.654
Everything we knew is gone.

37:33.731 --> 37:35.494
Yeah, I was pretty scared, too.

37:35.567 --> 37:39.401
I mean, not scared, but, like, concerned.

37:41.072 --> 37:42.300
Do you want to walk with me tomorrow?

37:42.674 --> 37:44.369
Try and get our minds off all this stuff.

37:44.442 --> 37:46.171
You want to walk with me?

37:46.344 --> 37:48.369
You did almost flatten me this morning.

37:48.446 --> 37:51.506
So, I figure it can't
really go worse than that, right?

37:52.550 --> 37:53.574
Yeah.

37:53.651 --> 37:54.675
Just one thing.

37:54.752 --> 37:58.210
It's totally no big deal, but
you might want to lose the molehog.

37:58.289 --> 38:01.315
Louis? Yeah, sure, not a problem.

38:05.797 --> 38:07.287
Wow.

38:08.099 --> 38:09.691
Someone looks happy.

38:10.568 --> 38:12.058
Ethan's great, isn't he?

38:12.236 --> 38:14.431
Baby, I know you like this one...

38:14.606 --> 38:18.372
but just don't let anyone change
who you are, okay?

38:18.543 --> 38:19.908
I know.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.145
You coming up?

38:27.552 --> 38:30.146
I think I'm going to sleep
down here tonight.

38:30.321 --> 38:31.549
Okay.

38:32.123 --> 38:33.351
Night, baby.

38:33.791 --> 38:35.122
Night, Mom.

38:36.728 --> 38:37.990
Good night, Dad.

38:50.008 --> 38:52.568
Hey, chew this sandwich for me.

38:53.311 --> 38:57.475
Granny, why didn't our family want us?
What's wrong with us?

38:57.782 --> 39:01.274
They think we're screw-ups
and we can't do anything right.

39:03.688 --> 39:05.019
It's a rat!

39:09.494 --> 39:10.620
No! No!

39:12.363 --> 39:14.354
- Screw up.
- Oh, Sid!

39:15.500 --> 39:17.434
We'll never make it home on this thing.

39:17.969 --> 39:21.336
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you capsized our berg, genius.

39:21.406 --> 39:22.600
Yeah, trying to escape.

39:22.674 --> 39:23.698
- Wimp!
- Whiner!

39:23.775 --> 39:24.799
- Crybaby!
- Land!

39:24.876 --> 39:26.434
Yeah, land! Wait, what?

39:26.511 --> 39:27.842
Not her. There!

39:28.680 --> 39:30.113
Land!

39:32.050 --> 39:34.314
Everyone paddle. Paddle!

39:59.377 --> 40:02.005
Food! I missed you so much!

40:02.180 --> 40:04.978
Look at me, I've wasted away.

40:11.723 --> 40:14.521
Okay, snack time is over.
We got to build a raft.

40:14.592 --> 40:15.616
Manny.

40:15.693 --> 40:17.957
Wow, Shira must really hate building rafts.

40:19.163 --> 40:20.892
Go get her. She can help us get back.

40:20.965 --> 40:21.989
Shira!

40:46.257 --> 40:47.281
Gotcha!

40:49.026 --> 40:50.186
Whoa!

40:56.834 --> 40:57.858
Let go of me.

40:57.935 --> 40:59.800
Where do you think you're going?

40:59.937 --> 41:01.063
Whoa!

41:02.807 --> 41:04.672
Switchback Cove.

41:04.942 --> 41:06.466
It's the way home.

41:07.445 --> 41:08.605
Oh, no.

41:08.679 --> 41:11.842
You call this a ship you miserable runts?

41:11.916 --> 41:13.850
Yeah, you little runts. Get to work.

41:13.918 --> 41:17.513
Faster, you worthless, wormy
sons of sorry excuses...

41:17.588 --> 41:19.180
for shark bait weevils!

41:19.257 --> 41:20.747
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

41:21.125 --> 41:24.185
Now get this chunk of ice
seaworthy by sundown...

41:24.262 --> 41:26.696
or I will keelhaul the lot of you!

41:29.433 --> 41:30.457
So what do you think?

41:30.802 --> 41:33.396
Two words, anger management.

41:33.871 --> 41:35.634
I'm talking about the current.

41:35.706 --> 41:38.197
Diego's right. We found the way home.

41:39.744 --> 41:43.043
Yeah, that's great.
Too bad we don't have a ship.

41:43.114 --> 41:46.641
Sure we do. It's right there.

41:46.717 --> 41:48.810
Well, that's a flawless plan.

41:49.287 --> 41:52.222
You want to pirate a pirate ship
from pirates.

41:52.490 --> 41:54.082
It pains me to say this, but...

41:54.158 --> 41:55.921
- our prisoner has a point.
- Yeah, well...

41:55.993 --> 41:59.861
Guys. The trees have ears.

42:15.980 --> 42:19.074
Wait a minute,
maybe we can help each other.

42:20.818 --> 42:23.446
Hey, little fellas. Hey, come on out.

42:23.988 --> 42:27.424
No, no, it's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

42:28.926 --> 42:32.157
How about you and us
against the pirates, huh?

42:34.732 --> 42:36.461
You got no idea what I'm saying, do you?

42:36.634 --> 42:40.126
Okay, ship, me want.

42:40.304 --> 42:42.238
Yeah, nice try Jungle Jim.

42:42.406 --> 42:44.340
Go ahead make fun. He got it.

42:49.847 --> 42:51.178
Thank you.

42:51.349 --> 42:52.509
May I try?

42:52.583 --> 42:53.845
Yeah, knock yourself out.

42:53.918 --> 42:57.081
Okay, watch this.

42:59.690 --> 43:02.124
Sick sloths sip broth,
sick sloths sip broth.

43:21.879 --> 43:23.369
Ta-da!

43:24.615 --> 43:25.639
That, they got?

43:35.026 --> 43:36.288
Yup, they're in.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.022
Great, we'll free your buddies
and we can all work together...

43:39.096 --> 43:40.825
to kick a little pirate booty.

44:00.785 --> 44:02.514
Easy, kitty. Water.

44:03.321 --> 44:04.652
You need it.

44:06.524 --> 44:08.082
I don't need anything from you.

44:08.159 --> 44:10.855
Fine, die of thirst.
That will really show me.

44:10.928 --> 44:12.190
Wait.

44:12.396 --> 44:14.057
I'll take it.

44:14.198 --> 44:15.290
Thank you.

44:15.566 --> 44:19.229
You have a way of saying "thank you"
that makes it sound like "drop dead."

44:19.403 --> 44:21.166
It's a gift.

44:21.238 --> 44:23.570
Well, you're pretty soft, for a saber.

44:23.641 --> 44:25.632
Excuse me, I am not soft.

44:25.710 --> 44:27.610
I happen to be a remorseless assassin.

44:27.678 --> 44:29.339
Diego-poo!

44:29.413 --> 44:31.278
Hey, I made you another coral necklace.

44:31.349 --> 44:33.180
He keeps losing them.

44:36.153 --> 44:38.917
Yeah, I think I'm starting to get
why you're not in a pack.

44:38.990 --> 44:41.151
Listen, I chose to leave my pack, all right?

44:41.225 --> 44:43.591
Congratulations, warrior princess.

44:43.661 --> 44:44.685
So did I.

44:45.029 --> 44:46.587
- Really?
- What?

44:46.664 --> 44:49.360
Nothing, I just know how hard that is...

44:49.433 --> 44:51.162
walking away from everything you know.

44:51.369 --> 44:54.338
Oh, great, are we going to
braid each other's fur now?

44:54.405 --> 44:56.202
Funny. Really funny.

44:56.273 --> 44:57.934
Can I tell you the difference
between you and me?

44:58.009 --> 44:59.772
I wouldn't still be wearing that necklace?

45:01.012 --> 45:03.640
No, we both
might have wanted out of pack life...

45:03.714 --> 45:06.148
but at least I didn't trade
one pack for another.

45:06.217 --> 45:07.775
I got something more.

45:07.852 --> 45:09.581
Oh, yeah, what's that?

45:10.121 --> 45:12.089
- A herd.
- What's the difference?

45:12.256 --> 45:13.553
We have each other's backs.

45:13.624 --> 45:16.149
Gutt has my back. I'm his first mate.

45:16.227 --> 45:19.162
Really? Because I don't see Gutt
sending out any search parties for you.

45:21.399 --> 45:23.367
You know, you won't beat him.

45:23.434 --> 45:25.698
Your big furry friend over there?

45:25.770 --> 45:27.499
He has no idea what he's up against.

45:27.571 --> 45:29.596
Yeah, but neither does Gutt.

45:30.107 --> 45:32.575
Unwind the binds,
don't let go until we're all on board.

45:32.643 --> 45:36.636
Okay, we need precision timing
from everyone to get that ship.

45:36.714 --> 45:39.205
Half-pint, you got your end covered, right?

45:44.055 --> 45:45.750
I'm going to take that as a "yes." Diego?

45:46.057 --> 45:47.456
I'll free his little friends.

45:47.525 --> 45:48.514
Sid and Granny?

45:48.726 --> 45:50.387
Untie the ship, sir!

45:50.461 --> 45:54.022
Right, unwind the vines,
and don't let go until we're all on board.

45:54.098 --> 45:56.066
We're relying on you, Sid. You got that?

45:56.133 --> 45:57.930
Yes, sir. Totally focused, sir.

45:58.002 --> 45:59.060
Don't worry.

45:59.136 --> 46:02.936
It'll be easy since
we don't have to guard Shira anymore.

46:06.844 --> 46:08.471
We need to move, now.

46:08.579 --> 46:10.604
Squint, batten down the hatches.

46:10.681 --> 46:12.410
Raz, hoist the anchor.

46:12.483 --> 46:14.644
And, Gupta, fly the colors.

46:14.718 --> 46:16.413
Of course, Captain.

46:16.487 --> 46:19.354
We're setting sail for vengeance, lads.

46:19.957 --> 46:21.481
I love vengeance.

46:22.259 --> 46:23.283
Captain!

46:23.360 --> 46:26.727
Shira! Oh, what a relief!

46:26.797 --> 46:28.230
I thought we'd lost you.

46:28.299 --> 46:30.358
The mammoth. He washed ashore with me.

46:30.434 --> 46:32.197
What? He's here?

46:33.104 --> 46:36.733
Did you sink your fangs into him?
Did he beg for his life?

46:36.807 --> 46:38.866
No, the saber took me down.

46:39.877 --> 46:41.811
You're a failure.

46:41.912 --> 46:47.077
I need warriors, and all I have
are kitty cats and bunny rabbits.

46:47.384 --> 46:49.682
And a seal and a kangaroo.

46:50.788 --> 46:54.781
You take the saber down, or you die trying.

46:54.959 --> 46:57.894
No excuses.

46:58.062 --> 46:59.723
Yes, Captain.

46:59.797 --> 47:00.821
Mr. Squint.

47:00.898 --> 47:01.922
Aye, sir.

47:02.099 --> 47:04.260
You're first mate now.

47:04.635 --> 47:07.263
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of
cool with me, Captain.

47:07.338 --> 47:10.136
Out of my way, saber.
You answer to me now.

47:10.207 --> 47:12.141
Gutt, listen, he's coming for the...

47:48.946 --> 47:50.641
Grab your weapons, mates!

47:54.752 --> 47:56.447
Not the spoon, Flynn.

47:58.055 --> 47:59.147
Follow me!

47:59.223 --> 48:00.451
Yeah, let's do this.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.292
Let me at him! Yeah!

48:10.935 --> 48:13.733
Guys, that's not necessary, really.

48:13.904 --> 48:15.633
I love you, too, yeah.

48:15.806 --> 48:19.071
Get to the ship, don't screw up.
Get to the ship, don't screw up.

48:19.243 --> 48:21.302
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

48:21.478 --> 48:23.275
- Unwind the vines.
- Don't let go.

48:23.447 --> 48:24.436
Unwind the vines.

48:24.582 --> 48:26.550
Don't let... Oh, yummo!

48:29.420 --> 48:31.911
Sid, no! It's a lotus berry.

48:32.089 --> 48:33.386
It will paralyze you.

48:33.457 --> 48:35.925
Oh, please. I know my berries.

48:36.393 --> 48:37.417
Don't...

48:37.494 --> 48:38.518
swallow.

48:38.596 --> 48:42.498
See, I'm fine.
If there's one thing I know, it's berries.

48:44.868 --> 48:45.926
Uh-oh!

49:15.966 --> 49:17.866
Yeah, finally!

49:19.937 --> 49:21.871
Who's the Easter Bunny now?

49:28.846 --> 49:30.780
- It worked, he bought it!
- Come on!

49:30.848 --> 49:31.906
No, no!

49:32.216 --> 49:33.478
It's been a diversion.

49:33.550 --> 49:35.575
I know, I'm having a blast.

49:35.653 --> 49:39.089
No, pinhead, they're stealing my ship.

49:43.394 --> 49:46.329
One thing, Sid. You couldn't do one thing?

49:46.397 --> 49:48.092
Look at you.

49:48.265 --> 49:49.289
Sid, can you hear me?

49:49.366 --> 49:50.390
Bye-bye.

49:50.467 --> 49:52.162
Say something, buddy.

49:53.337 --> 49:54.895
Let's get them!

49:55.139 --> 49:56.470
Let's go.

49:58.876 --> 49:59.934
The ship!

50:00.010 --> 50:03.002
Come on, we've got to catch it
before it hits open water!

50:07.885 --> 50:09.648
Sorry. All right, l'll hold you higher.

50:09.820 --> 50:11.287
Sorry. Sorry.

50:13.223 --> 50:15.589
Say adieu, mammoth!

50:16.060 --> 50:17.049
Adieu!

50:17.127 --> 50:18.151
Sorry, buddy.

50:27.538 --> 50:29.005
I'm coming, Sid.

50:36.080 --> 50:38.571
I got you! I got you! I got you!

50:44.922 --> 50:47.516
I'm coming for you, mammoth.

51:01.405 --> 51:02.599
Diego!

51:02.906 --> 51:03.930
Come on!

51:07.444 --> 51:08.706
Come on, move it!

51:20.524 --> 51:21.582
Why are you doing this?

51:21.658 --> 51:24.422
You don't understand. I don't have a choice.

51:24.495 --> 51:26.156
You don't have to live this way, Shira.

51:26.230 --> 51:27.595
You'll be safe with us.

51:27.664 --> 51:29.723
- We take care of each other.
- Diego!

51:30.033 --> 51:32.968
I can't hold on much longer.

51:33.771 --> 51:34.863
Diego!

51:34.938 --> 51:36.405
Come with us.

51:36.473 --> 51:37.770
Come with me.

51:50.154 --> 51:51.212
What are you doing?

51:51.288 --> 51:52.619
I've got your back.

52:17.614 --> 52:20.606
So long, banana breath.
Thanks for the ship!

52:44.842 --> 52:47.140
Oh, no, he's gone forever!

52:48.378 --> 52:50.107
Oh! There he is.

52:58.789 --> 53:00.780
Shore leave is over.

53:00.858 --> 53:04.123
Get your sorry carcasses on board now.

53:15.639 --> 53:17.129
Gutt, I can explain.

53:17.808 --> 53:19.002
When this ends...

53:19.076 --> 53:22.341
l'll have a tiger's skin hanging on my wall.

53:23.547 --> 53:26.072
I don't care whose.

53:29.119 --> 53:31.485
That mammoth has taken my ship...

53:31.555 --> 53:32.886
my bounty...

53:32.956 --> 53:35.823
and now the loyalty of my crew.

53:35.959 --> 53:38.860
I will destroy him...

53:39.029 --> 53:41.759
and everything he loves.

54:25.943 --> 54:28.434
Wait for it. Wait for it.

54:38.956 --> 54:40.116
That was awesome.

54:40.190 --> 54:41.214
Can I ask you guys something?

54:41.625 --> 54:43.559
How are you both so happy?

54:43.627 --> 54:45.686
Doesn't it weigh on you
that the world might be ending?

54:45.929 --> 54:47.556
Can I tell him our secret?

54:49.032 --> 54:50.556
Come here. Come here.

54:50.634 --> 54:54.730
We're very, very stupid.

54:58.475 --> 55:01.876
But, still, you're not a teensy bit
concerned about...

55:01.945 --> 55:04.573
I don't know, say, imminent death?

55:06.283 --> 55:07.614
Beep.

55:08.485 --> 55:10.112
I'm going to go find Peaches.

55:14.124 --> 55:17.423
Guys, over here. Come on, it's a shortcut.

55:17.494 --> 55:18.927
You're going to love this.

55:18.996 --> 55:21.328
Come on, girls, let's have some fun.

55:21.398 --> 55:22.422
Wow!

55:22.666 --> 55:25.499
- This is so cool.
- It's like we're upside down.

55:25.569 --> 55:27.400
That is amazing.

55:27.938 --> 55:29.064
Echo!

55:34.511 --> 55:37.344
Too bad your molehog friend
isn't here, huh?

55:37.414 --> 55:38.972
You're not really friends with him, are you?

55:39.049 --> 55:40.914
Yeah, come clean, Peaches.

55:40.984 --> 55:43.248
Are you friends
with that awkward little rodent or not?

55:43.787 --> 55:44.811
I mean...

55:44.888 --> 55:47.550
Louis and I, we've hung out or whatever.

55:47.991 --> 55:51.188
But, no, we're not really friends-friends.

55:51.261 --> 55:52.353
Not friends?

55:53.830 --> 55:55.855
Louis! I...

55:56.033 --> 55:57.466
Busted.

56:01.505 --> 56:03.234
Good to know.

56:03.306 --> 56:04.705
Louis, wait.

56:07.177 --> 56:08.872
He even runs away like a loser.

56:08.945 --> 56:12.642
Whoa, Peaches, don't stress.
You're with us now.

56:12.716 --> 56:15.310
Yeah, stress is so stressful.

56:15.385 --> 56:18.980
Yeah, girl, if you're going to stress
about something, stress about your hair.

56:19.056 --> 56:22.719
I know, right?
This humidity, I can't stand it.

56:26.296 --> 56:28.423
Guys, we should get out of here.

56:28.498 --> 56:30.489
Are you kidding? This is epic!

56:32.369 --> 56:34.234
Go! Go! Go!

56:40.177 --> 56:41.576
Yeah!

56:41.845 --> 56:43.210
How sick was that?

56:43.413 --> 56:46.314
Yo, that was insane.

56:46.483 --> 56:49.350
Hey, Peach, loosen up! Have some fun.

56:49.419 --> 56:52.582
Fun, you call that fun? I'm out of here.

56:52.656 --> 56:54.988
Come on, do you really want to go back...

56:55.058 --> 56:58.994
to hanging with a weird molehog freak
and give all of this up?

56:59.062 --> 57:01.326
I mean, it's bad enough
that your family is half possum and...

57:01.398 --> 57:02.456
Bad enough?

57:02.666 --> 57:05.931
There is nothing bad
about being part of my family.

57:06.002 --> 57:07.333
I like hanging by my tail.

57:07.571 --> 57:11.701
And if you geniuses are normal,
this species is going to end up extinct.

57:12.209 --> 57:15.406
Yeah, well, your species
is going to be extinct first.

57:15.579 --> 57:17.137
Burn!

57:17.214 --> 57:19.307
We're the same species, genius.

57:19.382 --> 57:21.942
What? Double burn.

57:41.772 --> 57:43.899
Hey, I can wiggle my toe again.

57:43.974 --> 57:47.375
The important one,
the little piggy who went to market.

57:47.444 --> 57:49.571
Wait! I'm talking again.

57:49.646 --> 57:53.207
I had so many things
trapped inside of me that I couldn't say.

57:53.784 --> 57:56.378
Like, "Hey, I'm not dead!"

57:56.586 --> 57:58.816
And, "Why does a hurricane
have an eye but not an ear?"

57:58.989 --> 58:02.755
I'll push him overboard.
You guys say it was an accident.

58:02.926 --> 58:05.656
I'm in. How about you, Diego? Diego?

58:06.296 --> 58:07.923
Hey, relax, buddy!

58:08.165 --> 58:11.191
Captain Crazy
and his floating petting zoo are history.

58:11.268 --> 58:14.135
Come on! We're finally heading home!

58:14.204 --> 58:15.330
I don't know what's wrong with me.

58:15.405 --> 58:18.238
I can't eat, can't sleep.
Maybe I'm coming down with something.

58:20.177 --> 58:22.077
I know what you've got.

58:22.145 --> 58:23.544
The L word.

58:23.647 --> 58:25.410
Yeah, leprosy.

58:25.482 --> 58:28.383
No, Sid, it's four letters.

58:28.451 --> 58:30.919
It starts with "L," ends with "E."

58:31.788 --> 58:32.846
Lice!

58:32.923 --> 58:36.359
No, Diego, my friend, is in love.

58:36.426 --> 58:38.951
Oh, yeah! Love.

58:39.429 --> 58:41.454
You mean with the pirate? No.

58:41.631 --> 58:44.862
Shira's gotten under your skin.
Come on, admit it.

58:44.935 --> 58:47.096
A rugged saber like you.

58:47.204 --> 58:49.866
A more rugged saber like her.

58:49.940 --> 58:52.773
No, no, no. You guys are dead wrong.

58:54.945 --> 58:58.472
Denial is the clincher.
You're in love, pussy cat!

58:58.548 --> 59:01.108
Diego and Shira
Sitting in a tree

59:01.184 --> 59:03.550
K - l - S - S - l - N - G

59:03.620 --> 59:05.679
Real mature, guys. Real mature.

59:05.856 --> 59:08.723
Then comes marriage
Then comes a baby in the baby carriage

59:08.892 --> 59:10.257
Sucking his thumb...

59:12.996 --> 59:14.759
Diego.

59:19.302 --> 59:22.396
Diego.

59:22.706 --> 59:24.071
Shira?

59:24.474 --> 59:26.874
I wanted to come with you.

59:29.546 --> 59:31.480
She's beautiful.

59:31.548 --> 59:33.140
Sid...

59:33.216 --> 59:37.414
I adore a sloth who cares
nothing about personal hygiene.

59:37.487 --> 59:39.114
That's me, baby.

59:40.156 --> 59:41.646
Granny.

59:41.725 --> 59:44.057
Come to me, Granny.

59:46.563 --> 59:48.292
Well, hello.

59:48.698 --> 59:53.032
The wrinklier the raisin,
the sweeter the fruit.

59:53.103 --> 59:54.695
Granny likey.

59:54.771 --> 59:56.898
Granny likey very much.

59:59.376 --> 01:00:03.039
- Guys, aren't you paying attention?
- Manny...

01:00:03.113 --> 01:00:05.377
- Manny, are you there?
- Ellie?

01:00:05.448 --> 01:00:07.348
We're over here, Manny.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:08.941
This way, Daddy.

01:00:09.052 --> 01:00:11.282
I really need you.

01:00:11.554 --> 01:00:13.579
I know, honey. Stay there.

01:00:15.892 --> 01:00:16.916
I'm coming.

01:00:16.993 --> 01:00:20.087
You were right, Manny.
You're always right.

01:00:20.363 --> 01:00:21.887
No, look, I was...

01:00:22.065 --> 01:00:24.727
Wait a minute. Ellie would never say that.

01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:26.928
Manny? Manny.

01:00:27.637 --> 01:00:30.197
No, they're not real. They're monsters!

01:00:30.273 --> 01:00:32.298
They're sirens. Don't listen to them!

01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:36.937
Who can take the sunrise
Sprinkle it with dew

01:00:38.782 --> 01:00:41.774
No! They may look real, but they're not.

01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:43.714
They're going to destroy the ship.

01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:47.356
Come on, tiger. Swim with me.

01:00:48.091 --> 01:00:50.582
Sid...

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.160
I have a snack for you.

01:00:55.432 --> 01:00:57.559
And she cooks, too.

01:00:58.702 --> 01:00:59.691
Sid, no!

01:01:15.852 --> 01:01:17.513
Why are we kissing?

01:01:17.587 --> 01:01:19.714
Because cruises are romantic?

01:01:22.492 --> 01:01:24.585
Five more seconds
and we'd have been goners.

01:01:25.528 --> 01:01:26.552
Call me.

01:02:36.199 --> 01:02:37.860
Here, girl.

01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:41.568
Here, Precious.

01:02:41.838 --> 01:02:44.102
She thinks she finally found her pet.

01:02:44.841 --> 01:02:47.275
Good girl. Here you go.

01:02:47.343 --> 01:02:51.336
Granny, can't you throw imaginary food
to your imaginary pet?

01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:55.384
Enough already.

01:02:55.485 --> 01:02:56.952
We need to keep a lookout for home.

01:02:57.353 --> 01:02:59.378
Ignore them, Precious.

01:02:59.456 --> 01:03:00.787
I do.

01:03:11.034 --> 01:03:12.661
You can't take your eyes off her
for one minute.

01:03:12.735 --> 01:03:14.327
Nope, it's like having a child.

01:03:16.272 --> 01:03:17.830
Only without any of the joy.

01:03:17.907 --> 01:03:19.238
Hey, brain trust...

01:03:19.442 --> 01:03:20.636
brace for impact.

01:03:25.982 --> 01:03:27.142
Guys, look.

01:03:27.584 --> 01:03:28.710
We're almost home!

01:03:28.785 --> 01:03:31.151
- Buddy, I never doubted you.
- Me either.

01:03:32.322 --> 01:03:35.985
Except for the six or seven times
I thought we were going to die.

01:03:51.074 --> 01:03:52.405
What's wrong, sweetheart?

01:03:52.475 --> 01:03:54.909
You ever say something
you knew you couldn't take back?

01:03:54.978 --> 01:03:56.377
Is this about Louis?

01:03:56.446 --> 01:03:58.175
I messed up so bad, Mom.

01:03:58.248 --> 01:04:00.011
It's okay. It happens.

01:04:00.316 --> 01:04:04.116
Cute boys can whiplash your brain.
No doubt about that.

01:04:04.187 --> 01:04:06.052
But Ethan was the wrong guy.

01:04:06.122 --> 01:04:07.248
And you figured it out.

01:04:07.724 --> 01:04:09.419
You'll know what to say to Louis.

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:17.092
What's going on?

01:04:22.772 --> 01:04:24.262
The land bridge.

01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:26.640
It's gone.

01:04:29.979 --> 01:04:31.344
We're trapped!

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.777
But we were supposed to meet Dad here.
What are we going to do?

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:51.357
Ellie!

01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:53.628
Peaches!

01:04:57.473 --> 01:04:59.600
Oh, no. The land bridge.

01:04:59.676 --> 01:05:01.109
But if it's gone...

01:05:01.211 --> 01:05:02.269
- how are we going to...
- Sid!

01:05:02.345 --> 01:05:04.404
No, they have to be on the other side.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.607
Manny, there is no other side.

01:05:06.683 --> 01:05:07.741
They have to be here.

01:05:07.817 --> 01:05:08.841
Ellie!

01:05:09.385 --> 01:05:11.353
Peaches!

01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:13.352
I'm here!

01:05:14.824 --> 01:05:16.416
Please...

01:05:16.526 --> 01:05:18.323
she's got to be here.

01:05:27.704 --> 01:05:28.898
Dad!

01:05:28.972 --> 01:05:30.496
- Wait, did you hear that?
- Manny...

01:05:30.573 --> 01:05:32.700
No, I heard something. I heard it!

01:05:36.145 --> 01:05:38.170
- Is that?
- Peaches? There she is!

01:05:38.715 --> 01:05:39.739
Dad!

01:05:39.816 --> 01:05:42.148
We're coming, sweetie. Don't move!

01:05:42.285 --> 01:05:43.309
Daddy!

01:05:43.386 --> 01:05:44.512
Peaches!

01:05:45.688 --> 01:05:47.451
Welcome home, Daddy.

01:05:47.523 --> 01:05:48.581
Let go of me.

01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:50.589
What are the odds?

01:05:50.827 --> 01:05:53.421
We were just talking about you.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:58.567
You like the new ship?
I call her Sweet Revenge.

01:05:59.302 --> 01:06:03.898
And look here. We've got the catch du jour.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.464
Ellie.

01:06:05.642 --> 01:06:07.371
I'm all right.

01:06:07.443 --> 01:06:08.910
Let my daughter go.

01:06:09.679 --> 01:06:10.703
It's okay.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.644
He wants me. And he's going to get me.

01:06:17.687 --> 01:06:22.681
Sacrificing yourself for your daughter.
How touching.

01:06:22.759 --> 01:06:24.488
How predictable.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.289
Now come and get her.

01:06:33.202 --> 01:06:34.226
Good day, mate.

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:35.601
You remember us?

01:06:35.672 --> 01:06:37.071
We're the bad guys.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.674
All right, let them go.

01:06:40.743 --> 01:06:42.301
I don't think so.

01:06:42.378 --> 01:06:45.040
You destroyed everything I had.

01:06:45.114 --> 01:06:47.514
I'm just returning the favor.

01:06:47.684 --> 01:06:49.049
No!

01:06:51.187 --> 01:06:53.178
I warned you.

01:06:53.256 --> 01:06:54.348
Stop!

01:06:57.093 --> 01:06:59.721
Let the mammoth go!

01:07:00.129 --> 01:07:01.494
Weiner?

01:07:03.099 --> 01:07:04.623
Who brought the muscle to the party?

01:07:04.701 --> 01:07:05.759
Louis, don't!

01:07:06.102 --> 01:07:08.468
What's he doing?
He's going to get himself killed.

01:07:08.538 --> 01:07:10.472
It's okay, I can handle him.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.566
How cute, a hero.

01:07:13.643 --> 01:07:15.838
Let's see what bravery gets you.

01:07:16.212 --> 01:07:18.407
Gupta, give the lad your weapon.

01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:20.775
Nice knowing you, kid.

01:07:33.496 --> 01:07:35.361
Let's dance, hero.

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:56.643
Don't stand there like barnacles. Get him!

01:07:58.821 --> 01:08:00.652
Oi, going somewhere, mate?

01:08:06.629 --> 01:08:07.960
Let me at him.

01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:14.430
Any last words?

01:08:14.937 --> 01:08:16.871
Precious!

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:19.066
Will you stop with the "Precious"?

01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:23.740
Mummy.

01:08:26.115 --> 01:08:28.743
Well, I guess we showed them, huh?

01:08:28.818 --> 01:08:31.116
- Precious!
- That's your pet?

01:08:34.991 --> 01:08:37.288
Maybe that crazy old bat
isn't that crazy after all.

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:41.526
Nope, she's nuts.

01:08:41.596 --> 01:08:45.089
You waiting for a formal invitation,
fancy pants?

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.225
Get in.

01:08:46.301 --> 01:08:48.064
I'm going to regret this.

01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:51.871
Bombs away!

01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:00.477
Don't be a scaredy cat.

01:09:08.057 --> 01:09:09.718
This smells worse than me.

01:09:09.792 --> 01:09:13.091
Precious, set your flippers
45 degrees north.

01:09:13.296 --> 01:09:14.957
Granny's done running.

01:09:15.031 --> 01:09:16.055
Back off.

01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:17.962
It's okay, I'm on your side.

01:09:18.935 --> 01:09:20.800
I knew you were a traitor.

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:25.100
Your little bunny nose wiggles
in the cutest way when you're mad.

01:09:25.174 --> 01:09:26.505
What?

01:09:26.776 --> 01:09:28.640
Your nine lives are over, kitty.

01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:29.837
Silly rabbit...

01:09:29.912 --> 01:09:31.470
piracy doesn't pay.

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:33.537
Hey, that's not cool. Come on, now.

01:09:40.923 --> 01:09:41.981
Anyone have a body wipe?

01:09:42.058 --> 01:09:44.925
Suck it up, buttercup. How's it looking?

01:09:47.697 --> 01:09:49.062
Not good, Granny sir.

01:09:49.999 --> 01:09:51.193
Full speed ahead!

01:09:51.501 --> 01:09:53.229
Dive, dive, dive!

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:02.041
Fire!

01:10:04.614 --> 01:10:06.206
Booyah, baby!

01:10:09.685 --> 01:10:12.051
This feels so good!

01:10:12.121 --> 01:10:13.611
Thank you, Mister Whale.

01:10:14.156 --> 01:10:16.283
- Hi, Manny.
- Sid!

01:10:16.359 --> 01:10:17.519
Help!

01:10:20.563 --> 01:10:21.757
Mom!

01:10:23.065 --> 01:10:25.295
No, Peaches, l'll get your mother.
You stay there.

01:10:25.368 --> 01:10:26.733
Hurry, Manny.

01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:31.869
Payback time.

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:34.069
Manny!

01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:36.407
- Ellie!
- I got this, Dad.

01:10:36.479 --> 01:10:38.970
Peaches, no! It's too dangerous!

01:10:39.048 --> 01:10:40.982
Not if you're half-possum!

01:10:57.033 --> 01:10:58.398
She did it.

01:10:59.235 --> 01:11:01.135
My daughter's all grown up.

01:11:05.841 --> 01:11:07.706
That's my girl.

01:11:10.913 --> 01:11:12.471
We need to get out of here.

01:11:12.582 --> 01:11:14.072
Go, go, I'm right behind you.

01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:15.242
No!

01:11:15.318 --> 01:11:17.183
I'm right behind you.

01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:18.947
Dad!

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:28.954
No!

01:11:31.434 --> 01:11:33.766
There's nowhere to run, Manny.

01:11:45.314 --> 01:11:49.080
You know, this ocean
isn't big enough for the both of us.

01:11:49.819 --> 01:11:50.911
Don't worry...

01:11:50.987 --> 01:11:54.252
you won't take up much space
once I flatten you.

01:12:07.903 --> 01:12:09.097
I told you, tubby...

01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:12.364
you shouldn't have messed
with the Master of the Seas.

01:12:13.776 --> 01:12:17.143
You know, sometimes,
it pays to weigh eleven tons!

01:12:17.446 --> 01:12:18.470
No!

01:12:18.648 --> 01:12:21.116
Bon voyage, monkey boy!

01:12:30.559 --> 01:12:32.322
Did somebody hail a whale?

01:12:36.265 --> 01:12:39.496
So, you must be Precious.

01:12:40.503 --> 01:12:42.334
Mission accomplished, Granny.

01:12:43.105 --> 01:12:45.767
Who says old ladies can't drive?

01:12:56.318 --> 01:13:00.345
Oh, Captain Gutt!

01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:02.855
That's me!

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:05.750
Let's rule the seas together.

01:13:06.062 --> 01:13:07.529
Aye, aye.

01:13:21.644 --> 01:13:22.668
Dad!

01:13:24.413 --> 01:13:26.278
How's that for an entrance?

01:13:31.821 --> 01:13:33.254
Dad!

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:35.623
Manny.

01:13:38.494 --> 01:13:41.088
I told you
your father would never give up on us.

01:13:41.163 --> 01:13:42.994
Never.

01:13:45.968 --> 01:13:47.959
Hey, I actually...

01:13:51.307 --> 01:13:52.638
You know, Sid...

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:54.266
you're not such a screw-up.

01:13:54.844 --> 01:13:56.436
- Really?
- Really.

01:13:56.912 --> 01:13:58.209
You're a hero.

01:13:59.715 --> 01:14:00.977
You too, Granny.

01:14:01.183 --> 01:14:02.707
Thanks, lady.

01:14:02.785 --> 01:14:05.481
So, still want me
on your scurvy crew?

01:14:05.554 --> 01:14:08.022
You bet.
Welcome to our herd.

01:14:10.259 --> 01:14:11.692
Hey, you.

01:14:12.528 --> 01:14:15.190
I can't believe you did that for me.

01:14:15.264 --> 01:14:16.424
Thank you.

01:14:16.766 --> 01:14:19.064
Someone once told me,
no matter what...

01:14:19.135 --> 01:14:20.898
you never leave a friend behind.

01:14:22.338 --> 01:14:25.307
All this sweetness
is going to rot my teeth.

01:14:25.374 --> 01:14:26.398
If I had any.

01:14:31.814 --> 01:14:33.873
Our home is gone.

01:14:33.949 --> 01:14:35.610
Where do we go now?

01:14:51.634 --> 01:14:53.795
Momma loves you, too!

01:15:28.037 --> 01:15:30.665
- I can't wait to check this place out.
- Yeah.

01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:32.172
- Excuse me?
- Dad!

01:15:32.408 --> 01:15:35.969
When you two get off this ship,
I expect you both to...

01:15:36.045 --> 01:15:37.069
have fun.

01:15:38.247 --> 01:15:39.475
You're a brave kid, Weiner.

01:15:39.548 --> 01:15:40.810
Wait, what?

01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:44.317
You heard me.
You two should go out and explore.

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.287
Go where the day takes you.

01:15:47.289 --> 01:15:48.779
But be back before sunset.

01:15:49.825 --> 01:15:51.918
An hour after sunset?

01:15:51.994 --> 01:15:53.188
Yeah, not a minute later.

01:15:53.262 --> 01:15:54.889
Deal.

01:15:54.964 --> 01:15:56.989
I love you, Dad.

01:16:02.504 --> 01:16:04.062
Okay if we hang with you guys?

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:05.231
Sure.

01:16:05.307 --> 01:16:06.899
I always liked him.

01:16:06.976 --> 01:16:10.309
Louis the hero.
Brave-a-licious.

01:16:12.014 --> 01:16:13.743
She's not my little girl anymore.

01:16:13.816 --> 01:16:15.784
And you're both going to be just fine.

01:16:16.518 --> 01:16:18.145
I know.

01:16:18.354 --> 01:16:22.984
You know, Sidney?
You've got yourself a nice family, here.

01:16:23.092 --> 01:16:25.287
A real family.

01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:27.989
Yeah, I'm pretty lucky.

01:16:28.063 --> 01:16:29.928
Here, chew this kiwi for me.

01:16:30.432 --> 01:16:32.059
Never again.

01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:33.862
Ta-da!

01:16:41.944 --> 01:16:44.310
- Hey, sailor.
- Whoa!

01:17:23.185 --> 01:17:24.709
Welcome, brother.

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:31.523
Behold, Scratlantis.

01:18:29.818 --> 01:18:30.910
No!

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:32.644
Stop!

01:18:34.223 --> 01:18:37.317
Brother, rise above this base desire.

01:18:37.393 --> 01:18:39.691
Be more than a rodent.

01:19:24.473 --> 01:19:30.241
<i># We are, we are #

01:19:30.312 --> 01:19:31.870

01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:24.331
