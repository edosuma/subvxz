every time you rescue someone you're
facing a hazard

you need to have strength to hold back
the hazard

01:03.520 --> 01:06.520
speed to outrun the hazard

01:07.769 --> 01:15.780
agility to avoid the hazard flexibility
to bend of the hazard and endurance to

01:15.780 --> 01:17.849
outlast the hazard

01:17.849 --> 01:22.408
every day you have to find out who you
are and what obstacles you face

01:22.920 --> 01:30.329
physical and emotional and you overcome
these obstacles as an individual who is

you save lives not purses

07:49.699 --> 07:52.699

you did a very brave thing back there

08:40.750 --> 08:43.750
you thought on your feet you know what
nobody got hurt

08:44.350 --> 08:48.639

you want to come

09:23.379 --> 09:26.379
wouldn't miss it for the world

09:29.899 --> 09:33.919
every instructors opinion was taken into
account something that we all discussed

09:33.919 --> 09:35.629
at great length

09:35.629 --> 09:38.629
I wish it could have played out
differently Zach I really do

09:39.799 --> 09:43.279
we can't believe it you're really not
gonna give me a rating

09:43.279 --> 09:47.509
after the way I nailed all those
training exercises to help with all

09:47.509 --> 09:51.830
those rescues the sack fact of the
matter is that with all your talent

09:51.830 --> 09:57.800
you'd never really got the concept of
team that's that's all about here

09:57.799 --> 10:01.519
what am I supposed to say to my sponsors
who paid my way

10:02.090 --> 10:07.430
how do I facing without a rating Oh Zack
you're good you've got skill you've got

10:07.429 --> 10:08.269
talent

10:08.269 --> 10:14.720
I've got nothing you know my own father
what's called me a born loser like my

10:14.720 --> 10:17.720
old man was right after all

10:25.450 --> 10:27.870
yeah

10:27.870 --> 10:32.070
in the pushover dad that I am I allowed
her to accept the sax invitation to this

10:32.070 --> 10:36.390
fashion and being a protective dad that
you are you decide to keep and I am

10:37.350 --> 10:41.278
yeah well we have to watch out for each
other we've had to move around a lot of

10:41.278 --> 10:43.049
us had to grow up real fast

10:43.049 --> 10:48.359
almost too fast job takes you all over
this is taking me a while to find the

10:48.360 --> 10:52.560
right situation but now that I'm doing
all right in the market i think i can

10:52.559 --> 10:55.469
make a stable life for on the aussie
gold coast

10:55.470 --> 11:01.050
ever since live was a kid she loved
being near the water ok kids are funny

11:01.049 --> 11:02.439
like that

11:02.440 --> 11:06.970
you sound like a guy is talking from
firsthand experience you must be a dad

11:06.970 --> 11:08.830
to shot

11:08.830 --> 11:12.610
I am I lost my son five years ago

11:13.179 --> 11:16.179
oh man

11:16.970 --> 11:18.009
yeah

11:18.009 --> 11:20.590
how to handle something like that

11:20.590 --> 11:28.899
now well I had all these wonderful
dreams from my family and after the

11:28.899 --> 11:31.779
accident my marriage fell apart

11:31.779 --> 11:37.419
basically my life fell apart and then
built the training center and it's

11:37.419 --> 11:40.509
gotten to the point where every part of
me is just wrapped up in the place

11:40.509 --> 11:45.759
that's kind of how i feel about their
become my dream

11:49.590 --> 11:54.269
if I know dad was around here somewhere
it's like I always been nine years old

11:54.269 --> 11:57.179
at least he cares about you

11:57.179 --> 12:02.729
when my mom died my old man dumped me
off my hands and never looked back

12:03.990 --> 12:08.370
you and your father you have something
really good to go

12:08.879 --> 12:14.700
you have something that they watch
people who care about now with the

12:14.700 --> 12:17.100
raiding the bound to ask you to stay

12:17.100 --> 12:22.740
okay people listen up got some killer
news from among all you graduates we've

12:22.740 --> 12:27.419
chosen one lifeguard to be a part of the
team here at Bay Watch why we want to

12:27.419 --> 12:33.809
present this suit to our newest team
member that is if she wants to be very

12:33.809 --> 12:36.809

I don't know what to say but you don't
have to say anything else

13:02.970 --> 13:05.970
I don't get it as far as I'm concerned
you deserve the rating

13:06.720 --> 13:11.189
that's easy for you to say you got the
damn yellow suit and how she got it is

13:11.188 --> 13:12.629
not for your tender ears

13:12.629 --> 13:15.629
one hint involve Jason and it took all
night

13:16.198 --> 13:19.678
that's not true and you know it and I
can't believe you all people would say

13:19.678 --> 13:21.319
that to me

13:21.320 --> 13:23.100
have the sticking place

13:23.100 --> 13:26.100
who needs this

13:33.970 --> 13:37.389
Joe's a couple looking for you which do

13:38.438 --> 13:45.909

party did there by then the total blur

like I have something to stay for first
she stabbed me in the back

14:03.759 --> 14:07.089
then you want to keep me around and
twist the knife and help with that

14:07.089 --> 14:10.449
look man what happened with your
evaluation it wasn't personal

14:10.958 --> 14:14.888
don't you get it I had a life here now
it's gone

14:15.458 --> 14:18.938
ever since I was a kid I felt like an
outsider trying to fit in

14:18.938 --> 14:22.509
messing things up when I came to the
center I felt like I was part of

14:22.509 --> 14:27.639
something like I belong somewhere that i
was home

14:27.639 --> 14:30.639
hey you kicked out of homes nothing new
to me

14:32.438 --> 14:35.528
you know maybe there's a reason you feel
like an outsider

14:35.528 --> 14:40.778
what is this crap are you forgetting all
the stuff we did together taking joy

14:40.778 --> 14:47.019
rides chasing chicks were more than just
my instructor man with my bro and I

14:47.019 --> 14:49.600

16:02.190 --> 16:05.520
different you are you're weird and funny

16:06.059 --> 16:09.899

in short you really put people at ease
and well i could use someone like you

16:15.240 --> 16:20.129

enough to be on Baywatch why would you

16:20.129 --> 16:22.500

39:18.650 --> 39:21.559
maybe not happy enough to cover the
Chinese for the center but it ought to

39:21.559 --> 39:26.299
make a pitching down payment down
payment

39:26.300 --> 39:30.050

training course the second time

student

39:34.340 --> 39:38.720
hey man I'm no quitter no way no how
back home it took me six times to pass

39:38.719 --> 39:43.129
the driver's test the seven if you
caught the bus incident but the point is

39:43.130 --> 39:49.070
I didn't quit and I'm not gonna quit now
I know I sound like I'm totally tripping

39:49.070 --> 39:51.170
here but I am so for real

39:51.170 --> 39:54.260

word that you're going to hear again and

40:26.400 --> 40:29.880
again and again over the next three
months

40:29.880 --> 40:32.880

heads
